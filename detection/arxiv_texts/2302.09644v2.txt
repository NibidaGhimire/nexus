Abstract
The plasma heating by the αparticle transport is a main self-heating source in inertial confinement fusion
(ICF) that determines the capsule implosion performance. Due to the high energy of αparticle and the
high temperature in the ICF capsule hot spot, significant non-equilibrium effect exists and the continuum
mechanics breaks down. For the numerical simulation of implosion and charged particle transport, the
Boltzmann equation needs to be solved to capture the kinetic effects. However, the 7-dimensional Boltzmann
equation, the highly frequent Coulomb collision, and the multi-folded integral stopping power formulation
greatly limits the computational efficiency and challenges the computational power. To overcome the high
computational cost of high-frequent coulomb collisions, we propose a hybrid collision model according to
which the collisions are categorized into low frequent large-angle collisions and high frequent small-angle
grazing collisions. The large-angle collision process is precisely solved based on the Coulomb cross-section.
For the highly frequent small-angle grazing, a statistic model is constructed with second-order accuracy in
time. The hybrid collision model reduces the computational cost of scattering calculation by two magnitudes.
For the multi-folded integral stopping power formulation, a neural network is used to improve computational
efficiency. Based on the proposed algorithm, we develop one-dimensional to three-dimensional module code
to directly solve the the αparticle transport Boltzmann equation. The αtransport module code is integrated
into the multi-physics LARED-S program. The MC version ICF software is verified by a simulation study
of the N191110 experiment.

The inertial confinement fusion (ICF) is a primary experimental approach to study the high energy density
fusion physics [1, 2]. In 2022, a breakthrough has been made to produce 3.15 megajoules of fusion energy
output from 2.05 megajoules of energy to the target capsule and achieves the ICF ignition. Following the
Lawson criterion, an ignited plasma is one where the fusion self-heating power is high enough to overcome
all the physical processes that cool the fusion plasma, creating a positive thermodynamic feedback loop with
rapidly increasing temperature [3]. The plasma self-heating through the αparticle transport and energy
deposition directly determines the fusion energy release and the implosion performance of the ICF capsule.
Therefore, an efficient and robust algorithm for the αparticle transport is highly required for the numerical
simulation of ICF.
Theαparticle transport is a multi-scale process. On the scale of particle interaction, the αparticle interacts
with the background electron, deuterium, and tritium through the Coulomb potential. On the mesoscopic
scale, the evolution of the distribution function of charged particles follows the Boltzmann equation. On
the macroscopic scale, the αtransport regime goes into the continuum regime, and a typical asymptotic
analysis shows that the αtransport process can be approximated by the multi-group diffusion equations.
The particle number density and Coulomb cross-section are large in an ICF capsule, which implies a high
collision rate. The effective Knudsen number, which is defined as the ratio of the effective π/2-collision
mean free path to the characteristic length is large [4]. The velocity distribution of αparticle is at a highly
non-equilibrium state. The kinetic Boltzmann equation with Coulomb potential needs to be solved.
To overcome the high dimension of the Boltzmann equation, we use the Monte Carlo method. Although
the effective free path of αparticle is larger, the physical mean free path is much smaller than the ICF
characteristic scale. Therefore, the computation cost of the traditional Monte Carlo (MC) method is ex-
tremely high and not applicable to the 2D/3D ICF simulation. Since the 1950s, statistical models have been
developing to predict the change in αparticle velocity after multiple collisions [5, 6, 7]. The statistic models
work well for small-angle soft collisions, but the accuracy decreases when large-angle collisions take charge.
The energy deposition model has also been developed, including the effects of the short-range collision, the
long-range interaction, and the quantum effect [8, 9]. In this work, we propose a new hybrid collision model
and a machine-learning energy deposition model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the αparticle
transport simulation.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The physical model and kinetic equations of the αparticle
transport are introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, we introduce the hybrid collision model for αparticle
transport. The machine learning based energy deposition model is presented in Section 3.1. The numerical
tests and ICF applications are shown in Section 4, and Section 5 is the conclusion.
22. Physical model of charged particles transport
The evolution of αparticle transport is characterized by the velocity distribution function f(⃗ x, t, E, ⃗Ω),
where ⃗ xis the spatial variable, tis the time variable, Eis the particle energy, and ⃗Ω is the velocity direction.
The velocity magnitude is related to the particle energy by |⃗ v|=p
2E/m α, and mαis the particle mass of
αparticle. The transport process of αparticle is described by the Boltzmann equation,
∂
∂tf(⃗ x, t, E, ⃗Ω) +|⃗ v|⃗Ω· ∇f(⃗ x, t, E, ⃗Ω) = Q+(f, fβ) +Q−(f, fβ) +S, (1)

In the nuclear fusion, the distribution of the αparticle He4is
f(⃗ x, t, E, ⃗Ω) = δE0(E)US2(⃗Ω)Nα(⃗ x, t), (3)
where δE0(E) is the Dirac’s delta function with E0= 3.5MeV, US2is the uniform distribution on the unit
sphere S2, and Nα(⃗ x, t) is the generated number of αparticle by the nuclear fusion. The interaction between
theαparticle and the background electron e, deuterium D, tritium Tis through the Coulomb interaction.

The velocity pairs ( ⃗ v∗′,⃗ v∗) and ( ⃗ v′,⃗ v) are the reversible collision pairs in an elastic collision and ⃗ vr=⃗ v−⃗ v′

collisions is the mean free path λ, which can be calculated by
λ=−ln(ξ)/Σt, (12)
where ξis the random number uniformly distributed in [0 ,1]. In the inertial confinement fusion, the plasma
number density is ne∼103nm−3, the plasma temperature is Te∼102MK, the Debye length is λD∼1 nm,
theπ/2 aiming distance is b0∼10−6nm the minimum scattering angle is θp∼10−4, the total cross section
σt∼10−3nm2. The characteristic time of ICF is t∼10−1ns and the number of collisions of one αparticle
within the ICF characteristic time is Nc>108. Such a high collision rate of Coulomb interaction makes the
numerical simulation extremely expensive.
In a Coulomb collision between the high energy αparticle and the background deuterium, tritium, electron,
theαparticle velocity direction Ω changes and a proportion of αparticle energy will be deposited. The
change of velocity direction is characterized by the Coulomb collision cross section Eq.(6), and simulated by
the Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo (MC) method is efficient for the high-dimensional calculation
compared to the discrete ordinate method, However, it suffers the stochastic noise with is on the order of
O(N−0.5
MC). The αparticle energy deposition is critical to the performance of ICF implosion, especially for
the ICF designs at ignition cliff [10, 11]. Therefore, a precise analytical method is used to avoid the MC noise
in the calculation of the energy deposition [9]. In the following two sections, we present a hybrid collision
model for the particle trajectory calculation and a neutral network for the energy deposition calculation.
3. A hybrid collision model for high energy αparticle transport
In this section, we introduce a hybrid collision model for αtrajectory calculation to overcome the large
computational cost of the high Coulomb-collision rate. For Coulomb interaction, most collisions are grazing
collisions with a small scattering polar angle, and only a small proportion of collisions are hard collisions

whose scattering polar angle is large. For soft collisions, the aiming distance of the αparticle and the target
deuterium/tritium/electron particle is relatively large, and for hard collisions, the aiming distance is small.
We introduce an artificial scattering-angle parameter θnand correspondingly, an aiming-distance parameter
bn, to characterize the collision type and the cross-section. Define the collisions with a scattering angle
smaller than θnas the soft collision, and define the collision with a scattering angle larger than θnas the
hard collision. In the simulation of inertial confinement fusion, the parameter of the numerical minimum
scattering angle is defined as

where Nhis the number of hard collisions in a time step ∆ t. Typically, the scattering-angle parameter is
chosen as θn∼10−3, and the corresponding aiming-distance parameter is b0,n∼1 nm. For a time step
∆t∼10−3ns, the hard collision number is estimated to be Nh∼102and the soft collision number is
estimated to be Ns∼105. For hard collisions, the typical Monte Carlo method is used. Based on the
numerical minimum scattering angle θnthe collision cross-section is divided into the hard scattering angle
cross section θ≤θnand the soft scattering angle cross-section Σ t= Σ th+ Σtsas shown in figure 1. The

numerical minimum scattering angle Eq.(13) is chosen such that Nhhard collisions happen in a time step

collisions, and the statistical model is stated as the following theorem.
Theorem 1. Define the time interval between two hard collisions as the hard collision free time. Consider a
hard collision free time τh, in which Nssuccessive soft collisions happen between αparticle and background
βparticle, for β=D, T, e . Assume the energy of αparticle is high with |⃗ vα| ≫ | ⃗ vβ|. The αparticle
velocity direction vectors are ⃗Ωi, for i= 1, ..., N s. Define the scattering vector ⃗Tias⃗Ti=⃗Ωi+1−⃗Ωi, for
i= 1, ..., N s−1. We have

Proof. Consider the αparticle with energy much higher than the background particles, i.e., |⃗ vα| ≫ |⃗ vβ|. We
have ⃗ vα∼⃗ vrwhere ⃗ vris the relative velocity. Therefore, in the collision process, the polar and azimuth
6scattering angles of ⃗ vαfollow the Coulomb cross section Eq.(6).

isuch that ⃗T′
iis perpendicular to ⃗Ωi,
and|⃗T′

calculated that the angle between ⃗Tiand⃗T′
iisθn/2, and
|⃗T′
i−⃗Ti|=1
2θn|⃗Ti|=O(θn). (20)
According to equation (13) θn∼(∆t1/2), and therefore |⃗T′

The total number of soft collision is Ns∼O(Σts|⃗ vα|τh), where Σ tsis the total soft collision cross section.
Based on equation (13), the soft collision cross section Eq.(15) can be expanded as Σ ts∼O(∆t). Therefore
Ns∼O(∆t) and |⃗T′
Ns−⃗T′

i=1⃗Ti
<⃗Ω1+Ns⃗T1+Ns|⃗TNs−⃗T1|
=⃗Ω1+Ns⃗T1+O(∆t5/2)(23)
Physically, it is estimated that the total scattering angle θTofαparticle is small θT<10−2until it decreases
to the local plasma thermal velocity [8], therefore the absolute error in equation (16) is acceptable.
The scattering vector of a soft collision can be decomposed as a polar scattering vector and an azimuthal
scattering vector, namely
⃗Ti=⃗θi+⃗ φi,for i= 1, ..., N s. (24)

Here, the momentum transfer cross-section calculates the momentum change of the αparticle in the direction

93.1. Neural network model for the αparticle energy deposition
In the ICF process, the αparticle deposits its energy to the hot spot and D/T ice shell as it transports in
the ICF capsule. In the high energy state, assuming that the αparticle velocity is much larger than the
local thermal velocity, the αparticle energy deposition rate can be derived from the Boltzmann equation.

The BPS model takes into account more detailed physics, however, the high dimension integral greatly limits
its computational efficiency. We use a fully connected neural network to interpolate the BPS stopping power
model. The neural network consists of two inner layers with ten neutrons in each layer. The input layer
contains the density, velocity, and temperature of electrons, deuterium, and tritium. The tansig function is
used as the activation function. The structure of the neural network is shown in figure 4. The Lenvenberg-
Marquardt method is used to train the stopping power neutral network. The mean square error reaches
10−9after about 1000 epochs iteration. The comparison between the neutral network interpolation and
BPS data is shown in figure 5.
The numerical method for αparticle transport is composed of the hybrid collision model that describes
the velocity scattering and direction change and the neural network predicts the energy deposition. The
algorithm is shown in the flow chart 6.
4. Numerical tests and applications in the ICF simulation
4.1. Numerical tests for the αparticle transport in a homogeneous medium
To verify the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid collision model, we simulate the transport process of
a charged particle in a uniform background plasma. The initial distribution of the charged particle is
f(⃗ v) = δ(1), the physical free path of the charged particle is λ= 10−8, and the numerical minimum
scattering angle is set as θn= 1.0×10−6,5.0×10−6,1.0×10−5,5.0×10−5,1.0×10−4,5.0×10−4. We
simulate the αparticle velocity distribution function for a transport distance of x= 1. The comparison of

4.2. The αparticle transport module test for ICF application
The αparticle transport code module is tested by simulating the ICF N170601 experiment [13]. The
distribution of the plasma flow field of N170601 at the bang time is shown in figure 8. We calculate the
αenergy deposition in t= 7 ps. The contour diagram of charged particle energy in ions and electrons for
two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometry is shown in figure 10 and 11. The comparison of energy
deposition profile in the radial direction between the traditional MC algorithm, the hybrid collision model,
the 1-3 dimensional calculation, and the neural network results are shown in figure 9. It is shown that
the proposed method provides consistent results with the traditional methods, which verifies the αparticle
transport code module.
4.3. Development of the integrated ICF software with the αparticle transport module
We develop the one-dimensional RDMG code and the two-dimensional LARED-S code for an integrated
ICF simulation [14]. Both codes have been applied in the simulation of the ICF N191110 experiment [13]. A
comparison between the hybrid MC version code and the SN version code is shown in figure 12. The error
of neutron reaction rate and energy deposition is around 5%. The calculation time of the SN version was
5080s, and that of the MC version was 5084s, which is comparable. The comparison between the 1D and

multi-dimensional code. The parallel zones and parallel efficiency of the 2D LARED-S program are shown
in figure 16, which shows good parallel efficiency for small-scale simulations.
5. Conclusion
In this work, we develop an efficient numerical simulation method for αparticle transport based on a hybrid
collision model and machine learning. The hybrid collision model improves the computational efficiency of
theαparticle transport by two orders of magnitude. The machine learning based stopping power neutral
network provides an extendable and effective algorithm for the calculation of αparticle energy deposition.
The multi-dimensional αtransport code modules are developed, and integrated into the multi-physics ICF
software. The accuracy and efficiency of the current MC version ICF software is verified by a simulation
study of the N191110 experiment.
