Abstract
In recent years, a number of bulk materials and heterostructures have been explored due
their connections with exotic materials phenomena emanating from flat band physics
and strong electronic correlation. The possibility of realizing such fascinating material
properties in simple realistic nanostructures is particularly exciting, especially as the
investigation of exotic states of electronic matter in wire-like geometries is relatively un-
explored in the literature. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce in this work
carbon Kagome nanotubes (CKNTs) — a new allotrope of carbon formed by rolling up
Kagome graphene, and investigate this material using specialized first principles calcu-
lations. We identify two principal varieties of CKNTs — armchair and zigzag, and find
both varieties to be stable at room temperature, based on ab initio molecular dynamics
simulations. CKNTs are metallic and feature dispersionless states (i.e., flat bands ) near
the Fermi level throughout their Brillouin zone, along with an associated singular peak
in the electronic density of states. We calculate the mechanical and electronic response
of CKNTs to torsional and axial strains, and show that CKNTs appear to be more me-
chanically compliant than conventional carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Additionally, we find
that the electronic properties of CKNTs undergo significant electronic transitions — with
emergent partial flat bands and tilted Dirac points — when twisted. We develop a rela-
tively simple tight-binding model that can explain many of these electronic features. We
also discuss possible routes for the synthesis of CKNTs. Overall, CKNTs appear to be
unique and striking examples of realistic elemental quasi-one-dimensional materials that

CKNTs may provide an interesting nanomaterial platform where flat band physics and
chirality induced anomalous transport effects may be studied together.

1. Introduction
Over the past two decades, the design, discovery and characterization of nanomateri-
als and nanostructures with special features in their electronic band structure has gained
prominence. Exemplified famously by the case of linear dispersive relations in graphene
(associated with massless Dirac fermions [1, 2]), such features often point to the existence
of exotic electronic states, and the possibility of realizing unconventional electromagnetic,
transport and optical properties in real systems. In recent years, materials and structures
featuring dispersionless electronic states or flat bands have been heavily investigated due
to the fact that electrons associated with such states have quenched kinetic energies1(are
spatially localized), and interact in the strong correlation regime[3–6]. This manner of
interaction leads to a variety of fascinating materials phenomena, including superconduc-
tivity[3,7], ferromagnetism[8], Wignercrystallization[9,10], andthefractionalquantum
Hall effect [11–14].
Along these lines, moiré superlattices in twisted bilayers [8, 15–19] and materials
with tailored atomic lattices [20–23] have received much attention since they feature flat
bands and rich electron physics. In order to observe and maintain desirable electronic
properties, such systems usually involve some degree of engineering, and more often, a
fine control over important system parameters (e.g. bilayer twists at specific magic angles
[24], oracriticalmagneticfieldstrengthinquasi-two-dimensional(2D)networkstructures
[25, 26]). Therefore, a strand of recent investigations has focused on the synthesis and
characterization of materials which feature electronic flat bands due to their natural
atomic arrangements [27–35]. Exotic electronic states hosted by such materials can be
stablewithrespecttoperturbationssuchaschangesintemperatureorappliedstrains,and
they can often display such states without external fields — features which make them
suitable for device applications. Alongside these experimental studies, computational
investigations have also probed elemental versions of such materials, i.e., stable bulk or
2D nanomaterials made of a single species of atom that can feature unusual electronic
states by virtue of their atomic arrangements alone [36–39, 39–41]. The present study

1While linearly dispersive states are associated with extremely high charge carrier mobilities, flat
band electrons are massive and effectively have zero group velocity.
Preprint submitted to arXiv December 15, 2023extends this particular line of work to the important case of quasi-one-dimensional (1D)
nanomaterials featuring flat bands, which have generally received far less attention in the
literature.2
The possibility of realizing flat band physics and exotic states of electronic matter in
wire-like geometries is particularly exciting. While well known theoretical considerations
[45, 46] appear to preclude the existence of long range order in low dimensional systems
(necessary, e.g. in realizing superconducting states), such restrictions do not necessarily
apply to the quasi-one-dimensional structures considered here [47]. In fact, there are
reasons to expect that the screw transformation symmetries and quantum confinement
effects often associated with such systems can actually result in enhancement of collec-
tive or correlated electronic properties [48–50], and that such properties are likely to be
manifested in manners that are quite different from bulk phase materials. In particular,
materials such as the ones considered in this work can be chiral— due to intrinsic or
applied twists — and therefore, feature anomalous transport (the Chiral Induced Spin
Selectivity, or CISS effect [51, 52]). The exploration of simultaneous manifestations of
such effects along with correlated electron physics has begun fairly recently [53–56]. We
posit that the carbon nanostructures explored here are likely to emerge as a possible
material platform for such studies in the future.
Due to its unique allotrope forming features and versatility [57–59], carbon is partic-
ularly attractive as a building block of novel materials. A large number of computational
studies have recently been devoted to 2D and bulk allotropes of carbon displaying Dirac
cones, flat bands and non-trivial topological states [37, 60–67]. On the other hand, al-
though several 1D allotropes of carbon are well known [68–79], none of these systems are
usually associated with flat band physics. As far as we can tell, there have been only a
few earlier attempts at producing and investigating flat bands in realistic 1D nanomate-
rials of carbon: partially flat bands in zigzag graphene nanoribbons [80], spin polarized
flat bands in hydrogenated carbon nanotubes [81], and moiré type flat bands in chiral
carbon nanotubes with collapsed structures [82, 83] or incommensurate double wall ge-
ometries [84]. Our contribution aims to address this particular gap in the literature by
studying a family of realistic 1D carbon nanostructures that naturally feature flat bands
throughout their Brillouin zone. The flat bands in the structures presented here arise out
of geometric and orbital frustration and without the aid of dopant or major structural
instability effects, as employed in the aforementioned studies. Moreover, as we demon-
strate, these dispersionless electronic states show fascinating transitions as the structures
2There has been recent work (see e.g. [6, 42–44]) on quasi-two-dimensional systems and heterostruc-
tures, featuring one-dimensional flat bands, or flat bands along specific directions of a two-dimensional
Brillouin zone. In contrast, the systems studied here are all elemental quasi-one-dimensional (1D) nanos-
tructures that feature flat bands throughout the entirety of their (one-dimensional) Brillouin zone.
3are subjected to strains, while also proving to be robust and retaining many desirable
characteristics in some respects.
To obtain a 1D carbon nanostructure with flat bands, our starting point is a planar
sheet of Kagome graphene. We then “roll up” this 2D material along different directions
to obtain Carbon Kagome Nanotubes (CKNTs). Kagome graphene and related bulk
structures have recently received much attention in the materials literature [36, 38–41, 85,
86], andalsointhephysicsliterature, wherethematerialisoftenidentifiedasa“decorated
honeycomb” or “star lattice” structure [23, 87–92]. Although Kagome graphene remains
to be experimentally synthesized, successful synthesis of a variant of this material, i.e.,
nitrogen-doped graphene on a silver substrate — a 2D material with a Kagome pattern,
has been carried out recently [93, 94]. Moreover, synthesis of novel complex nanotube
structures in general (see e.g. [95]) and through the roll-up of 2D sheets in particular,
is fairly common (see e.g. [96]), thus suggesting that CKNTs can be synthesized in the
near future.
In this work, we introduce CKNTs, and carry out a thorough and systematic first
principles characterization of this material in terms of its structural, mechanical and
electromechanical properties. Wherever relevant, we provide comparisons of the prop-
erties of CKNTs against those of conventional carbon nanotubes (CNTs). All CKNTs
studied here are metallic and feature flat bands (throughout their Brillouin zone) near
the Fermi level, along with an associated singular peak in the electronic density of states.
We show in particular that CKNTs appear to be more mechanically compliant when com-
pared against CNTs, and that their electronic properties undergo significant electronic
transitions — with emergent partial flat bands and Dirac points — when subjected to
torsional strains. Our studies are made possible largely due to a suite of recently devel-
oped symmetry adapted electronic structure calculation techniques [97–103], that allow
ab initio calculations of 1D materials and their deformed states to be carried out ac-
curately and efficiently. We also develop a π-electron based tight binding model that
includes up to next-nearest-neighbor interactions, which is able to capture many of the
electronic properties of CKNTs, as revealed via first principles data.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the geometry of the
materials under study (subsection 2.1), as well as various aspects of the specialized first
principles computational techniques used in this work (subsection 2.2). Section 3 presents
results, touching on structural (subsection 3.1), mechanical (subsection 3.2), electronic
(subsection 3.3.1) and electromechanical (subsection 3.3.2) aspects. We discuss possible
routes to the synthesis of CKNTs in subection 3.4 and conclude in Section 4. Details of
the tight binding model for CKNTs are presented in Appendix Appendix A.
42. Material and Methods
In this section, we introduce the geometry of Carbon Kagome nanotubes (CKNTs)
and their construction from Kagome graphene through the “roll up” procedure commonly
employed in other similar types of nanomaterials [104, 105]. We also provide an outline
of the various computational and theoretical methods used in our study.
2.1. From Kagome Graphene to Carbon Kagome Nanotubes
Several recent studies have explored the structure of Kagome graphene sheets and
related bulk structures [23, 36, 38, 39, 41, 85]. As a starting point, we first consider the
geometry of Kagome graphene. The hexagonal unit cell of this 2D material consists of
6 carbon atoms that form a pair of equilateral triangles, as shown in Fig. 1. We used

150◦, while θ2is60◦. The other parameters can be found in Table 1.
the planewave code ABINIT [106–108] to optimize the geometry of this structure. Our
calculations employed norm conserving Troullier Martins pseudopotentials [109], an en-
ergy cutoff of 50Ha,21×21×1k-point sampling and Fermi-Dirac smearing of 0.001Ha.
These parameters were sufficient to produce accurate energies, forces and cell stresses
for the pseudopotentials chosen [99]. We employed both Perdew-Wang [110] local den-
sity approximation (LDA) and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)[111] generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) exchange correlation functionals. At the end of the relaxation
procedure, the atomic forces were typically of the order of 10−5Ha/Bohr, while the cell
stresses were of the order of 10−8Ha/Bohr3.
Table 1 shows that the optimized structural parameters obtained by us are in very
good agreement with the literature. As expected [112], the LDA bond lengths are some-
what shorter than those obtained through functionals involving gradient corrections, al-
though the variations observed are quite minor overall. Notably, the intertriangle C-C
5bond length was found to be slightly smaller than the bond length corresponding to the
triangle sides. Additionally, the calculated bond angles were found to be 60◦(in-triangle)
and150◦(inter-triangle) almost perfectly, consistent with the literature. Next, following

2.2. Computational Methods
We outline the computational methods employed in this work to study CKNTs. These
include specialized, real-space symmetry adapted first principles simulations (using the
Helical DFT code [98, 99]) and periodic plane-wave calculations (based on the ABINIT
[106–108], Quantum Espresso [120–122] and PWDFT [123–126] codes), to augment the
Helical DFT results. A tight-binding model which is able to replicate many of the elec-
tronic properties revealed by the above first principles calculations is detailed separately
in Appendix A. In what follows, the atomic unit system with me= 1,ℏ= 1,1

is used throughout, unless mentioned otherwise. We will denote the standard orthonor-
mal basis of R3witheX,eY,eZ. Lowercase boldface letters will denote vectors in three
dimensions, while uppercase boldface will denote matrices.
2.2.1. Helical DFT calculations
The majority of the first principles calculations in this work have been carried out
using Helical DFT [98, 99] — a symmetry-adapted real-space formulation of Kohn-Sham
DensityFunctionalTheory[127]. Wenowhighlightafewimportantfeaturesandtechnical
details of this specialized computational technique. A key advantage of the methodology
is its ability to efficiently simulate quasi-one-dimensional materials by exploiting global
structural symmetries, which enables it to reduce calculations to just a few representative
atoms within the simulation cell. The nanotubes of interest to this work, both in pristine
7or deformed configurations, can be conveniently described using helical and cyclic sym-
metries about a common axis [49, 105, 128]. Specifically, for a nanotube with axis eZ,
ifP={r1,r2, . . . ,rM:ri∈R3}are the coordinates of the representative atoms in the
simulation cell (or fundamental domain ), then the collection of coordinates of the entire
structure can be expressed as:
S=[
ζ∈Z
µ=0,1,···,N−1M[
i=1R(2πζα+µΘ)ri+ζτeZ. (1)
Thus, the symmetry group of the nanotube consists of the collection of isometries (i.e.,
rotations and translations):
G=n
Υζ,µ= 
R(2πζα+µΘ)|ζτeZ) :
ζ∈Z, µ= 0,1, . . . ,N−1o
. (2)
Here, each symmetry operation Υζ,µconsists of a rotation operation about eZthrough the
angle 2πζα+µΘ(denoted via the action of the rotation matrix R(2πζα+µΘ)above), along
with simultaneous translation by ζτabout the same axis. The quantity Nis a natural
number that captures cyclic symmetries in the nanotube, with the angle Θ = 2 π/N
(i.e.,Nis the same as nin armchair (n, n)and zigzag (n,0)nanotubes). The scalar
αis related to the applied or intrinsic twist in the structure, with the amount of twist
per unit length measured as β= 2πα/τ. The parameter τis related to the pitch of
screw transformation symmetries in the nanotube, and variations in this quantity enable
extensions and compressions about the tube axis to be captured.
For the CKNTs considered in this work, we have employed an orthogonal unit cell
with 12representative atoms, as shown in Fig. 2. The parameter αtakes values between
0and1, with α= 0representing untwisted structures. The value of τas suggested by
the roll-up construction [105, 129] is 5.137Å and 8.897Å for undeformed armchair and
zigzag CKNTs, respectively.
Helical DFT uses a higher order finite difference discretization scheme in helical coor-
dinates[97, 98] to solve the following symmetry adapted equations of Kohn-Sham DFT
over the fundamental domain:
HKSψj(x;η, ν) =λj(η, ν)ψj(x;η, ν). (3)
The Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian operator:
HKS=−1
2∆ +Vxc+ Φ + Vnl, , (4)
8consists of kinetic energy, exchange correlation, electrostatic contribution (i.e., both
electron-electron and electron-nucleus interactions) and non-local psudopotential [130]
terms. Thesymmetry-adaptedquantumnumbers η∈[−1
2,1
2), and ν∈ {0,1,2, . . . ,N−1}
serve to label the eigenstates and electronic occupation numbers of the system (analo-
gous to ‘k-points’ in periodic calculations of solids), along helical and cyclic symmetry
directions, respectively. At the end of self-consistent solution of the above equations,
the system’s ground state electronic free energy per unit fundamental domain may be
calculated. We will denote this quantity as FGround
State(P,D,G)to signify its explicit depen-
dence on the positions of the representative atoms within the fundamental domain ( P),
the fundamental domain itself ( D), and the symmetry group of the structure under con-
sideration ( G). By introducing variations in Gand by minimizing FGround
State(P,D,G)with
respect to the coordinates of the representative atoms, Helical DFT can be employed for
ab initio exploration of the deformation response of a nanomaterial under torsional or
axial loads [99].
In order to facilitate the large number of ground state electronic structure calculations
of various CKNTs as well as their electromechanical response under applied deformations,
Helical DFT simulations were carried out in three stages. First, for a given nanotube
and applied strain parameters, ab initio structural relaxation calculations were carried
out using a mesh spacing of h= 0.3Bohr, and by sampling 15reciprocal space points in
theηdirection. These discretization choices are sufficient to produce chemically accurate
forces and ground state energies for the norm conserving pseudopotential [130, 131] used
to model the carbon atoms in this work [99]. Atomic relaxation was carried using the Fast
Inertial Relaxation Engine [132] and calculations were continued until each atomic force
componentoneveryatominthesimulationcellreached 0.001Ha/Bohrorlower. Next, for
each relaxed structure, we redid a self-consistent calculation using the finest discretization
parameters that could be reliably employed within computational resource constraints.
This corresponds to a mesh spacing of h= 0.25Bohr and 21reciprocal space points in the
ηdirection. This calculation step enables accurate calculations of energetics and stiffness
parameterstobecarriedout[99]. Finally, usingtheselfconsistentdensitiesandpotentials
obtained through the above step, we performed a single Hamiltonian diagonalization step
using 45reciprocal space points in the ηdirection. The eigenstates so obtained were used
forbanddiagramandelectronicdensityofstatescalculationsthatarepresentedinSection
3.
For all Helical DFT calculations, we used the Perdew-Wang parametrization [133] of
the LDA[127]. We did not observe any major qualitative differences in the electronic
properties between the LDA results presented here and those produced using gradient
corrected functionals [111]. We also employed 12thorder finite differences [98, 100, 134–
139], vacuum padding of 10Bohrs in the radial direction and 1milli-Hartree of smearing
9using the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The pseudopotential employed was generated using
the Troullier-Martins scheme [109, 131], and is identical to the one used for the flat sheet
calculations presented earlier (Section 2.1).
2.3. Plane-wave DFT calculations
We used plane-wave DFT [140, 141] for carrying out a few additional first principles
calculations of CKNTs. Specifically, we investigated the dynamic stability of undistorted
CKNTs by performing ab inito molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The highly
scalable PWDFT code [123–126] was used for this purpose. We investigated two generic
CKNTs — one each of the zigzag and armchair varieties — with radii of 0.75and0.85nm
for our simulations. In order to capture long range deformation modes, we considered
atoms beyond the minimal periodic unit cell and chose multiple layers of the tubular
structures along the axial direction. This resulted in supercells containing 144and216
atoms for the armchair and zigzag variety tubes respectively. Periodic boundary condi-
tions were enforced along the axial direction and a large amount of vacuum padding ( ∼35
Bohr) was included in the other two directions to prevent interactions between periodic
images. Optimized Norm Conserving (ONCV) pseudopotentials [142, 143], and LDA
exchange correlation were employed. An energy cutoff of 40Ha was employed and only
the gamma point of the Brillouin zone was sampled. The structures were first relaxed
using the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm [144] following which
AIMD simulations were performed at temperatures of 315.77K,631.55K and 947.31K
using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat [145, 146]. Time steps of 1.0fs were employed for
integration and 5.0−7.0ps of trajectory data were collected for analysis.
Finally, we used the Quantum Espresso code [120–122] for computing the projected
density of states (PDOS) of undistorted armchair and zigzag CKNTs. Pseudopotentials
from the Standard Solid State Pseudopotentials (SSSP) library [147, 148], along with an
energy cutoff of 40Ha, LDA exchange correlation and Gaussian smearing (corresponding
to an electronic temperature of 315.77K) were employed. Keeping in mind the geometry
of the nanotube, the PDOS were calculated in the local atomic coordinate frame, i.e., the
projections were taken on atomic orbitals that had been rotated to a basis in which the
occupation matrix appears diagonal.
3. Results and Discussion
In this section, we discuss the structural, mechanical and electronic properties of
CKNTs as revealed by our simulations.
3.1. Structural properties: Cohesive energy, sheet bending modulus and dynamic stability
Fig. 4 shows the cohesive energy of armchair and zigzag CKNTs as the tube radius
varies in the range 1to3nm (approximately). Owing to the contribution from the elastic
10sheet bending energy, the cohesive energy of both types of tubes decrease monotonically
as the tube radius increases, i.e., the tubes are energetically more favorable with decreas-
ing sheet curvature. In our calculations, the energy of an atom in Kagome graphene, as
calculated in terms of the large radius limit of the energies of CKNTs, agrees with direct
calculations of the sheet to better than 1milli-eV, thus ensuring overall consistency of
the results. For a given radius, the zigzag and armchair CKNTs appear nearly identical
energetically, similar to the behavior of conventional CNTs, also shown in Fig. 4. As-
suming a quadratic dependence of the bending energy on curvature, i.e., Euler-Bernoulli
behavior, we evaluated the area-normalized sheet bending modulus of Kagome graphene
to be 0.506eV and 0.502eV in the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively (also see
Fig. 2). This is about a third of the sheet bending modulus of conventional graphene,
estimated to be about 1.5eV through similar first principles calculations [100].
From Fig. 4, it is also evident that for a similar value of the radius, CNTs are ener-
getically more favorable compared to CKNTs (i.e., CNTs have larger cohesive energies).
We remark however that this observation in of itself does not preclude the synthesis of
CKNTs. Indeed, fullerenes can be readily produced, although they have long been known
to have cohesive energies that are somewhat lower than other common allotropes of car-
bon [104, 149–151]. More recently γ-graphyne, which has a significantly lower cohesive
energy compared to graphene [152] has also been chemically synthesized [153–155]. No-
tably, there has also been success in synthesis of other unusual quasi-one-dimensional
allotropes of carbon starting from conventional carbon nanotubes [73], which may be
adopted for producing CKNTs.

The phonon stability of Kagome graphene sheets has been investigated earlier [41].
11Based on band-folding considerations [156–158], such calculations are also likely to be
indicative of the stability of CKNTs at zero temperature. To investigate the finite tem-
perature structural stability of CKNTs, we carried out AIMD simulations at three dif-
ferent temperatures — 315.77K,631.54K and 947.31K. The system energy is observed
to be stable throughout each of these simulations (Fig.7). We conclude that CKNTs are
able to maintain their overall structural integrity at room temperature, and beyond, thus
making them physically realistic nanostructures. Notably, during the course of the sim-
ulations, the structures appear to undergo dynamic distortions similar to conventional
CNTs [105, 159, 160], and show a propensity for developing transitory ellipsoidal cross
sections, especially at elevated temperature (Fig. 6 (a)). Nevertheless, the dodecago-
nal rings which make up CKNTs and which are crucially related to their fascinating
electronic properties (discussed in Section 3.3), continue to be maintained (Fig. 6 (b)).
Given the relatively low sheet bending stiffness of Kagome graphene (as compared to
conventional graphene, e.g.), it is quite possible that large diameter CKNTs, like their
CNT counterparts [161–163] have a tendency to collapse. From this perspective, the
distorted cross sections described above are possible indicators of this kind of structural
transition, and warrant further investigation in the future. Snapshots of the AIMD sim-
ulations is provided in Figs. 5 and 6, and the entire simulation trajectories are available
as Supplementary Materials.

parameters. We consider (12,12)armchair (radius 1.7nm) and (12,0)zigzag (radius
0.98nm) CKNTs as representative examples. For both these tubes, we start from the
undistorted, relaxed configurations.
For simulations involving torsion, we increment the parameter αin regular intervals,
imposing up to about β= 4.5◦of twist per nanometer, the limit of linear response for
conventional CNTs [105]. For each twisted configuration, we relax the atomic forces
and compute the twisting energy per unit length of the nanotubes as the difference in
the ground state free energy (per fundamental domain) of the twisted and untwisted
structures, i.e.:

and979.51eV-nm for the armchair and zigzag tubes, respectively. In the linear elastic
regime, the torsional behavior of nanotubes is well approximated by continuum models
whichsuggestthat ktwistshouldvarywiththetuberadiusinacubicmanner[99,105,164].
By use of this scaling law, we were able to estimate that conventional CNTs with radii
comparable to the CKNTs considered above are expected to be significantly more rigid
with respect to twisting (with ktwistvalues equal 2.8977×104eV-nm and 5525.0eV-nm
for1.7nm and 0.98nm radius conventional CNTs, respectively).
Next, for simulations involving axial stretch and compression, we proceed in a manner
similar to the torsion simulations. For a given value of axial strain ϵ, we modify the
pitch of the helical symmetry group as τ=τ0(1 +ϵ), with τ0denoting the equilibrium,
undistorted values. Subsequent to this kinematic prescription, we relax the atomic forces,
and compute the extensional energy per unit length of the nanotubes as the difference in
the ground state free energy per fundamental domain, between stretched and unstretched

the collections of relaxed positions of the atoms in the fundamental domain in each case.
The stretching stiffness of the nanotubes may be then calculated as:

ϵ=0. (8)
In our simulations, we restricted ϵto be between +3.6%and−3.6%. In this range,
Ustretched (ϵ)is found to depend in a quadratic manner on ϵ, consistent with linear elastic
behavior (see Fig. 9). We also observed a small Poisson effect, which we have ignored
in subsequent analyses. For armchair (12,12)and zigzag (12,0)CKNTs, we estimated
kstretchto be 5220.9eV/nm and 2093.4eV/nm respectively. Based on scaling laws arising
from continuum theory [164], we also estimated that conventional armchair CNTs with
the same radii as the CKNTs considered above would be noticeably stiffer to axial defor-
mations ( kstretchvalues equal to 1.2213×104eV/nm and 7048.2ev/nm for 1.7nm and
0.98nm radius conventional CNTs, respectively).
Overall, these results suggest that CKNTs are significantly more pliable with respect
to torsional and axial deformations, as compared to their conventional CNT counterparts.

3.3. Electronic properties
We discuss the electronic properties of CKNTs as revealed by first principles simula-
tions. We start from a discussion of the properties of undistorted tubes, following which
we discuss the electronic response of the tubes when subjected to torsional and axial
strains. In Appendix A we describe a symmetry adapted tight-binding (TB) model that
is able to explain these electronic properties.
3.3.1. Electronic properties of undeformed CKNTs
Conventional CNTs can be metallic or semiconducting depending on whether they are
armchair (all tubes metallic) or zigzag (tubes with cyclic group order Ndivisible by 3 are
metallic), and the electronic band diagrams of these materials prominently feature Dirac
points near the Fermi level [99, 100, 104, 129, 165]. In contrast, our simulations reveal all
CKNTsto be metallic, with their electronic band diagrams prominently featuring disper-
sionless electronic states, or flat bands , close to the Fermi level. Figs. 10a and 12a show
complete band diagrams of undistorted CKNTs (i.e., all electronic states corresponding
to allowable values of reciprocal space parameters η, νare plotted), while Fig. 11 and 13
show symmetry adapted versions of these plots (i.e., band diagrams with chosen recipro-
cal space parameters along cyclic or helical directions). Notably, a CKNT of cyclic group
orderNis found to feature 2Nnearly degenerate flat bands near the Fermi level. An
associated singular peak in the electronic density of states (Figs. 10b, 12b) is also ob-
served3, and both zigzag and armchair tubes are found to feature quadratic band crossing
3Our simulations suggest that the singular peak in the DOS of CKNTs occurs very close to the Fermi
level — about 0.006Ha away for the examples discussed here. In experimental situations, the peak in
16(QBC) points at η= 0(corresponding to the gamma point of the flat sheet). These fea-
tures make CKNTs striking examples of realistic quasi-one-dimensional materials that
are likely to exhibit strongly correlated electronic states. The detailed investigation of
exotic materials phenomenon in CKNTs resulting from such strong electronic correlations
— including e.g., Wigner crystallization, flat-band ferromagnetism and the emergence of
superconducting, nematic or topological phases [41, 166, 167] — is the scope of future
work. Considering that such phenomena have been studied primarily in bulk and two
dimensional materials, the role that the quasi-one-dimensional morphology of CKNTs
might play in them makes these investigations particularly interesting.

The dispersionless states in CKNTs are caused by destructive interference, resulting
from geometric and orbital frustration, as has also been shown to occur in other Kagome
lattice systems [168–170]. The electron effective mass is arbitrarily large at the flat band
and the diminished electronic kinetic energy allows the Columbic interactions to domi-
nate, resulting in strong electronic correlation. In turn, this causes electron localization4
and the emergence of a sharp peak (i.e., van Hove singularity [173]) in the electronic den-
sity of states (DOS) near the Fermi level (as shown in Figs. 10b and 12b). The localized
the DOS can be brought to the Fermi level exactly, by application of an external electric field or by
doping [41], thus making the associated electronic states more readily accessible.
4The localization mechanism described above is different from Anderson localization, where electronic
waves become diffusionless due to disorder/impurities in the system [171, 172].

At this point, it is worth mentioning some similarities of the electronic properties of
CKNTs with their conventional counterparts. Like conventional CNTs, the fascinating
electronic properties of CKNTs are largely connected to πelectrons formed from radially
oriented pzorbitals, while the pxandpyorbitals form in-plane σbonds and are largely
electronically inactive [41]. This is supported by projected density of states (PDOS) cal-
culations for CKNTs (Fig. 15), which show that the singular peak in the (total) electronic
density of states near the Fermi level is largely attributable to the contributions of the
individual (radially oriented) pz(l= 1, ml= 0) orbitals, while pxandpyorbital con-
tributions lie well below the Fermi level. Moreover, the band diagrams of CKNTs have
19some similarities in appearance with those of conventional CNTS, e.g., the presence of
Dirac points at η= 0for zigzag tubes and at η=±1
3for armchair ones (Figs. 10a, 12a).
However, unlike conventional CNTs, these Dirac points do not appear at the Fermi level
in undistorted CKNTs, but are prominently featured as a part of the excited states of
the system.

3.3.2. Electromechanical response of CKNTs: Effect of torsional and axial strains on
electronic properties
We discuss the changes to electronic properties of CKNTs to applied deformations.
First, we discuss the effect of torsional strains. We use the (12,12)armchair CKNT as
a prototypical example; zigzag CKNTs are found to have similar behavior. As shown
in Fig. 16a, application of twist to the CKNT destroys the in-plane C6symmetry of
the underlying Kagome graphene lattice structure, while maintaining its C2symmetry.
Consequently [174–176], the quadratic band crossing (QBC) point at η= 0splits into a
pair of Dirac points (Fig. 17a)5. Furthermore, the degeneracy in the 2Nflat bands at the
Fermi level appear to be lifted, and a number of dispersionless states appear to give way
to bands that are only partially flat . The change of completely flat bands to ones which
have some dispersion near η= 0is also evidenced by the electronic density of states plot
in Fig. 17b, which shows that the sharp peak near the Fermi level decays as the rate of
applied twist increases. Despite these twist induced changes, a number of dispersionless
states survive (Fig. 16a) and spatially localized wavefunctions associated with such states
continue to be hosted by the nanotube (Fig.16b). Notably, the application of twist
resultsinenergydispersionrelationsthatfeatureratherdramaticchangesintheelectronic

0, to massless ones as the Dirac points are reached, and then re-appearance of infinitely
massive ones as the edge of the Brillouin zone is approached (i.e., closer to η=±1
2).
Overall, these observations suggest that torsional strains provide a way of controlling
correlated electronic states in CKNTs. Moreover, twisted CKNTs, being chiral, are likely
to show asymmetric transport properties [51, 52]. Therefore, they provide an interesting,
realistic material platform where the combined manifestations of anomalous transport
phenomena (the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity effect [178]) and flat band physics may
be realized and studied.

Next, we discuss the case of axial strains. In general, such deformations also tend
to introduce some degree of dispersion into the flat bands of CKNTs near η= 0, while
lifting their degeneracies near the Fermi level. However, their influence appears to be

less dramatic than the case of torsional deformations described above. Nevertheless,
the axial compression case deserves particular mention. Considering the zigzag (12,0)
CKNT for example, we observe (see Fig. 18a) that the dispersion introduced in the flat
bands near η= 0results in curvature of these states in a manner that is opposite (i.e.,
convex vs. concave) of the situation encountered while twist is applied (i.e., Fig. 17a).
Thus, a scenario akin to the touching of a pair of parabolic bands [176, 179] emerges.
Upon subjecting the tube to larger values of compression, we observed that the parabolic
bands near η= 0give way to linear dispersion, i.e., the emergence of Dirac points.
Commensurate with these changes, the sharp peak in electronic the density of states
(Fig.18b)alsodiminisheswithincreasingmagnitudeofaxialstrain, althoughthedecrease
appears to be less dramatic than the situation encountered with torsion (i.e., Fig. 17b).
Overall, the above observations are consistent with literature that suggests that
quadratic band crossing points are unstable with respect to strains [180, 181]. It is
also worthwhile at this point to contrast the electromechanical response of CKNTs to
conventional CNTS. Zigzag CNTs with cyclic group order divisible by 3 and armchair
CKNTs are both metallic [100], and they are known to be more sensitive to axial and
torsional strains respectively. The effect of such deformations, at least for small strains, is
to open up a gap at the Dirac points of these materials, resulting in metal-semiconductor
22transitions [99, 165, 182–185]. As described above, CKNTs appear to show more dramatic
electronic transitions when subjected to such strains. At the same time, the simulations
above suggest that at least some dispersionless states in CKNTs are robust and continue
to be available when the tube is subjected to small torsional and axial strains.

3.3.3. Tight Binding Model
Based on the findings of the PDOS calculations (Fig. 15), we have developed a sym-
metry adapted tight binding (TB) model of the electronic structure of CKNTs. Our
model involves π-electrons and incorporates up to next-nearest-neighbor interactions.
The model is able to capture salient features of the electronic properties of undistorted
CKNTs as revealed via first principles calculations. Additionally, by taking into account
the variation in the hopping parameters with relative changes in bond lengths (eqs. A.5,
A.7) the TB model is also able to account for the effects of strain on the electronic prop-
erties. We present details of the model in Appendix A. The TB model also produces
results consistent with a π-orbital based empirical pseudopotential calculations [103, 186],
but has the added advantage of being analytical in nature. Further analysis of the math-
ematical properties of the TB model is the scope of ongoing work [187].
233.4. Possible routes to the synthesis of CKNTs
Our calculations suggest that CKNTs are kinetically stable, which is often taken to be
a promising sign of the synthesizability of carbon allotropes [41, 188]. In the past, a wide
variety of metastable carbon allotropes have been fabricated[189], often with significantly
lower cohesive energies than other common stable counterparts. Examples of successful
synthesis of such unusual carbon allotropes include γ-graphyne [152–155] , T-carbon
[73, 190] and nitrogen-doped Kagome graphene [93, 94]. In particular, various methods
of synthesis of conventional carbon nanotubes, including laser ablation and chemical
vapor deposition have been explored [191, 192]. Some of these techniques have also been
successfully used in manufacturing other 1D carbon allotropes, e.g. T-carbon nanotubes,
which can be created from conventional carbon nanotubes through a picosecond pulsed-
laser irradiation induced first order phase transition. Such techniques provide additional
routesforsynthesizingCKNTs. Irrespectiveofthemethod,weanticipatethattheanalysis
presented in this paper is likely to be instrumental in realizing CKNTs experimentally.
Since a variety of routes have been exploited for synthesizing different allotropes of
carbon, multiple avenues also possibly exists for realizing CKNTs. We suggest two pos-
sibilities here, both based on the organic synthesis of Kagome graphene and subsequent
roll-up of this material to form CKNTs. One possibility is to use silver adatoms to trans-
formtetrabromobocyclopropenetointermediateorganometalliccomplexandtothenform
Kagome graphene on the surface of SiO2substrate with etchant sensitive gold layer in
between [93], as represented in left panel of Fig. 19a. The second possibility is through
the use of cyclopropane or bicyclopropane [41, 188], wherein tailoring of ligand chem-
istry can be used to form self-assembled kagome graphene on the surface of gold (111),
deposited on a SiO2substrate (shown in right panel of Fig. 19a). This latter method is
similar to recently demonstrated self-assembly procedures in metastable carbon nanowig-
gles [193, 194]. After the synthesis of Kagome graphene, targeted etching of the gold
layer [195] can result in the curling of the 2D material into CKNTs, as desired. The lower
bending stiffness of kagome graphene in contrast to conventional graphene (Section 3.1)
will likely assist in this step (Fig.19b).
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have introduced carbon Kagome nanotubes (CKNTs) — a new al-
lotrope of carbon formed through a roll-up construction of Kagome graphene. These
nanotubes are unique in the sense that contemporarily, they are perhaps the only known
example of realistic, elemental, 1D nanostructures that can host dispersionless electronic
states, or flat bands , in the entirety of their (one-dimensional) Brillouin zone. They also
feature Dirac points in their band diagram, as well as a singular peak in their electronic

25density of states. Thus, they provide an attractive platform for studying and exploiting
strongly correlated electronic phenomena in nanomaterials with wire-like geometries.
To characterize CKNTs, we have carried out an extensive series of first principles
simulations, including specialized calculations based on symmetry adaptation. We have
investigated both zigzag and armchair varieties of CKNTs. Cohesive energy computa-
tions and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations suggest CKNTs should exist as stable
structures at room temperature and beyond. Our simulations reveal that it is easier to
roll Kagome graphene into CKNTs than it is to roll conventional graphene into CNTs.
Moreover, CKNTs are found to be significantly more pliable with respect to torsional and
extensional deformation as compared to CNTs of similar radii. Both zigzag and armchair
varieties of CKNTs are found to be metallic, and are seen to feature multiple degenerate
flat bands and a corresponding singular peak in the electronic density of states, near the
Fermi level. We studied the response of electronic properties of CKNTs to applied tor-
sional and axial strains and showed that such deformations are very effective in inducing
large changes in the electronic states of this material. We also developed a tight binding
model which is able to capture many of the electronic properties of CKNTs observed
in first principles calculations, and also reproduces correctly, the effect of strains in the
material.
Given the relative stability of CKNTs and the fact that there has been recent successes
in experimentally synthesizing various novel carbon allotropes, it appears likely that
CKNTs can be produced and studied under laboratory conditions in the near future.
Such pursuits, as well as more detailed characterizations of electronic phenomena in
CKNTs at a level beyond Density Functional Theory, and the exploration of anomalous
transport phenomena in distorted CKNTs, are all attractive directions of future research.

Appendix A. Tight binding model for CKNTs
We have developed a pπ-orbital based tight-binding (TB) model for understanding
the electronic structure of CKNTs. As described below, to correctly reproduce the find-
ings of the ab initio calculations, especially the effects of strain, we found it necessary
to include up to next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interactions and to make the hopping am-
plitudes dependent on relative changes in bond lengths. The TB Hamiltonian in second
quantization framework [196, 197] is written as:
H=X
i,γεiγa†
iγaiγ+X

⟨i,j⟩t1(iγ,jγ )a†
iγajγ

26Here, εiγdenotes the onsite energy of site iand orbital γ,t1(iγ,jγ )andt2(iγ,jγ )are the
hopping amplitudes between orbitals γof the nearest-neighbors (NNs) ⟨i, j⟩and the
next-nearest-neighbors (NNNs) ⟨⟨i, j⟩⟩, respectively, and h.c. is the hermitian conjugate.
The annhilation and creation operators are denoted by aiγ,a†
iγ, respectively. The onsite
energy, εiγ, is considered zero for convenience. To calculate the TB band structure of
CKNTs, we adopt the Dresselhaus method [104]. This procedure involves development of
a TB formulation for the flat sheet (i.e., Kagome graphene), and subsequent mapping of
theatomsofthetwo-dimensionallatticetoacylinder, soastoinvokeboundaryconditions
appropriate to the nanotube. Details of these steps are discussed below.
Results from our TB calculations are presented in Figs. A.20 and A.21. As can be
seen, there is excellent qualitative agreement between these results and the first principles
data presented earlier.

Axial or torsional strains in CKNTs can be mapped to appropriate deformations in

a shear strain in the underlying Kagome graphene lattice. Generally, such distortions

The matrices HBBandHBAcan be written in the similar manner, and are not shown
here for brevity. Consistent with the geometry of Kagome graphene and the mapping
of strains from CKNTs to the Kagome graphene lattice, we choose a1= [1,0,0],a2=

we further set θ0=π

The hopping amplitudes depend on the structure of the lattice and the applied defor-

Appendix A.2. (n, m)nanotube and boundary conditions
To adapt the TB model of Kagome graphene described above to CKNTs, we follow
the method developed by Dresselhaus [104]. The general procedure starts by considering
29a semi-infinite two-dimensional sheet, whereby the two opposite edge sides are glued to-
gether to form an infinite tube, with the axis of the tube chosen to be the eZ-direction.
The periodicity along the circumferential direction naturally imposes periodic bound-
ary conditions on the circumferential wave vector, denoted k⊥below. In what follows,
we briefly describe the procedure for imposing such periodic boundary conditions on a
nanotube constructed from an arbitrary two-dimensional lattice. Axial and torsional de-
formations in the nanotube can be naturally incorporated by considering the effect of
applied strains to the two-dimensional lattice.
We first describe the construction of an (n, m)nanotube by rolling up a flat sheet
along the direction of a chiral vector . The flat sheet is assumed to be generated using
a 2D hexagonal lattice, with lattice vectors a1anda2, each of length a0(the lattice
vectors for Kagome graphene are given in Appendix A.1 above). The chiral vector for
a nanotube with chirality (n, m)is then Ch=na1+ma2, where n, mare non-negative
integers. The translation vector which is parallel to the axis of the nanotube is expressed
asT=T1a1+T2a2. Furthermore, gcd(T1, T2) = 1,T1, T2∈Z, and:
T1=2m+n
dr, T2=−2n+m
dr, dr= gcd(2 m+n,2n+m).
The translation vector determines the axial periodicity of the nanotube, such that in real
space, the unit cell of the nanotube is described by a rectangle generated by Ch×T. The
reciprocal lattice vectors corresponding to ChandTarek⊥andk∥, respectively. Since,
ChandThare orthogonal vectors, this gives Ch·k⊥= 2π,Ch·k∥= 0,T·k⊥= 0, and
T·k∥= 2π. By substituting k⊥andk∥into the orthogonality constraints, we get:
k⊥=1
N(−T2b1+T1b2), (A.8)
k∥=1
N(mb1−nb2), (A.9)
where, b1=2π
a0(a2×z)andb2=2π
a0(z×a1)are the unit vectors of the reciprocal lattice
of the two-dimensional lattice, a0is the lattice parameter, and zis perpendicular to both
a1anda2. Furthermore, Nis the number of primitive unit cells per nanotube unit cell,
and can be expressed as:
N=|Ch×T|
|a1×a2|. (A.10)
Note that, for the zigzag and armchair tubes considered here, Nis related to the cyclic
group order as N= 2N.
The energy dispersion relations (i.e., electronic band diagrams) can be obtained [104]
by first writing the TB Hamiltonian of the flat sheet, and then applying the periodic
boundary condition along the direction of chiral vector, Ch, i.e., ψ(x+Ch) =ψ(x). This
30leads to the condition exp(ik·Ch) = 1and quantizes the wave vector k⊥, thus giving
rise to Ndiscrete wavevectors parallel to k⊥, in the direction of Ch. The wavevector
k∥, which is parallel to the axis of the nanotube, remains continuous, however. Since
the two-dimensional sheet is being rolled-up to form a quasi-one-dimensional nanotube,
the Brillouin zone (BZ) is one-dimensional, and the condition T·k∥= 2πimplies that
the length of the Brillouin zone is 2π/T. Thus, the None-dimensional energy dispersion
relations for the nanotube can be parametrized as ϵ
sk⊥+k∥
|k∥|k
, with s= 0, . . . ,N −1
and−π
T≤k <π
T.
Note that this construction immediately implies that a zigzag or armchair CKNT of
cyclic group order Nwill feature 2Nflat bands, since the starting point is the Kagome
grapheneTBHamiltonian(Appendix A.1)featuringasingleflatbandacrossitsBrillouin
zone. This is consistent with the observations made from first principles calculations
(Section 3.3).
