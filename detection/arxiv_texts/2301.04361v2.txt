Abstract
In this paper, uniform convergence on compacta is studied on the space of func-
tions taking values in the set of ﬁnite Borel measures. Relat ed limit theorems,
including L´ evy’s continuity theorem and functional limit theorems for (classical and
non-commutative) additive processes, are also described.

1 Introduction
In the theory of stochastic processes, a family of measures µtindexed by a parameter
t, such as time or initial point, naturally appears. Such a family can be r egarded as a
measure-valued function t/mapsto→µton the parameter set. This paper oﬀers some simple and
fundamentalobservationsonthetopologyandconvergence ont hespaceofmeasure-valued
continuous functions.
LetS,Tbe topological spaces. Let M(S) denote the set of nonnegative ﬁnite Borel
measures on Sequipped with the weak topology. We designate the set of continuou s
mappings from Tto the space M(S) asC(T;M(S)). Our aim is to ﬁnd a topology
onC(T;M(S)) such that the sequential convergence ( µ(n)
t)t∈T→(µt)t∈T(n→ ∞) in
that topology occurs if and only if for every compact set K⊂Tand for every bounded
continuous function f:S→Rwe have
lim
n→∞sup

Sf(x)µ(n)
t(dx)−/integraldisplay
Sf(x)µt(dx)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle= 0. (1.1)
1The expression (1.1) can be regarded as the “uniform convergenc e of ((µ(n)
t)t∈T)n∈Non the
compact set K.” However, since a topology is in general not uniquely determined by s e-
quential convergence in that topology, there might be more than o ne topologies satisfying
our requirement. To be precise, therefore, the sequence (( µ(n)
t)t∈T)n∈Nabove should be
replaced by an arbitrary net((µ(α)
t)t∈T)α∈A. After introducing a topology on C(T;M(S))
in Section 2, we consider relationships between the topology and con vergence of charac-
teristic functions in Section 3, and then vague convergence of pro bability measures and
convergence of moments in Section 4. Sections 5 and 6 are devoted to applications, which
originally motivated the present work. The convergence (1.1) natu rally appears in a func-
tional limit theorem for additive processes, see Section 5, and also in the convergence of
the marginal distributions of noncommutative stochastic process es, see Section 6.
2 Topology on C(T;M(S))
In what follows, we regard M(S) andC(T;M(S)) asuniform spaces to obtain the topol-
ogyTprescribed above instead of deﬁning it directly via nets. The reader can consult
Kelley [14, Chapters 6 and 7] for uniform spaces and uniform conver gence of functions.
We also see that Tis metrizable and hence “determined by sequences” if Sis a separable
metric space (Corollary 2.2).
LetCb(S) denote the set of bounded continuous real-valued functions on S. DeﬁneU
as the uniformity (or uniform structure) on M(S) generated by the collection of sets
U(f,ε) :=/braceleftbigg
(µ,ν)∈M(S)2:/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
f dµ−/integraldisplay
f dν/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle< ε/bracerightbigg
(2.1)
indexed by f∈Cb(S) andε >0. The topology of the uniform space ( M(S),U) is exactly
the weak topology. We further deﬁne Uas the uniformity on C(T;M(S)) generated by
the collection of sets
V(K;f,ε) :=/braceleftbig
(µt,νt)t∈T∈C(T;M(S))2: (µt,νt)∈U(f,ε) for allt∈K/bracerightbig

(µt,νt)t∈T∈C(T;M(S))2: sup

f dµt−/integraldisplay
f dνt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle< ε/bracerightbigg
(2.2)
indexed by compact K⊂T,f∈Cb(S), andε >0. Then the topology TonC(T;M(S))
induced by Uis, by deﬁnition, the topology of ( U-)uniform convergence on compacta1).
Obviously, lim α(µ(α)
t)t∈T= (µt)t∈TinTif and only if

t(dx)−/integraldisplay
Sf(x)µt(dx)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle= 0 (2.3)
for every compact set K⊂Tand for every f∈Cb(S).
By the following fact, adopted from Kelley [14, Theorem 11, Chapter 7],Tis indeed
thecompact-open topology [14, p.221] on C(T;M(S)):
1)“Uniform convergence on compacta” means the same as “locally unif orm convergence” if Tis locally
compact.
2Proposition 2.1. LetXbe a topological space and (Y,U)be a uniform space. On the set
C(X,Y)of continuous mappings from XtoY, the topology of U-uniform convergence on
compacta is identical with the compact-open topology. In pa rticular, the former topology
depends only on the topology that Uinduces on Y.
Proposition2.1 enables us to obtainthe topology Tina way diﬀerent fromabove. For
example, let us suppose that Sis a separable metric space. Then there exists a distance
ρonM(S) which induces the weak topology (e.g., the L´ evy–Prokhorov dista nce). We
replaceU(f,ε) in (2.1) with
Uρ(ε) :={(µ,ν)∈M(S)2:ρ(µ,ν)< ε}
and deﬁne Vρ(K;ε) in a way similar to (2.2), which leads to another uniformity Uρ
onC(T;M(S)). By Proposition 2.1, Uρinduces the topology T. Hence we have the
following:
Corollary 2.2. LetSbe a separable metric space and Tbe a topological space.
(i)Fix a distance ρwhich induces the weak topology on M(S). For a net ((µ(α)
t)t∈T)α∈A
inC(T;M(S))and(µt)t∈T∈C(T;M(S)), the following are equivalent:
•(2.3)holds for every compact K⊂Tand for every f∈Cb(S);
•limαsupt∈Kρ(µ(α)
t,µt) = 0holds for every compact K.
(ii)Suppose that Tis locally compact and σ-compact. Then the topology Ton
C(T;M(S))is metrizable.
Proof.(i) merely states that UandUρinduce the same topology. In (ii) a desired
distance is given by

as usual. Here, ( Kj)j∈Nis an exhaustion sequence of T.
3 Characteristic function and L´ evy’s continuity the-
orem
IfSis thed-dimensional Euclid space Rd, we can obtain the topology Tin Section 2
by means of characteristic functions. Writing the characteristic f unction of µ∈M(Rd)
as ˆµ(ξ) :=/integraltext
eiξ·xµ(dx), we identify the space M(Rd) with the space /hatwiderM(Rd) :={ˆµ:µ∈
M(Rd)}ofcharacteristic functions. Thelatterspaceisasubset of C(Rd;C)andhence has
a distance ˆ ρwhich induces the topology of locally uniform convergence. By L´ evy ’s con-
tinuity theorem, the distance ˆ ρ, transferred to M(Rd) through our identiﬁcation, induces
the weak topology. Thus, we can take ˆ ρas the distance ρdiscussed in Section 2. To put
it diﬀerently, given a topological space T, the homeomorphism M(Rd)∋µ/mapsto→ˆµ∈/hatwiderM(Rd)
is lifted to the homeomorphism C(T;M(Rd))∋(µt)t/mapsto→(/hatwideµt)t∈C(T;/hatwiderM(Rd)).
We can think that the preceding paragraph generalizes L´ evy’s con tinuity theorem for
measure-valued functions. In this direction, we can prove the follo wing:
3Theorem 3.1. LetTbe a topological space and ρbe a distance on M(Rd)which induces
the weak topology. Suppose that µ(n)
t∈M(Rd)for each t∈Tand for each n∈Nand
(µt)t∈T∈C(T;M(Rd)). Then the following are mutually equivalent:
(i) lim n→∞supt∈K/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraltext
Rdf dµ(n)
t−/integraltext
Rdf dµt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle= 0for every compact set K⊂Tand for
everyf∈Cb(Rd);
(ii) lim n→∞supt∈Kρ(µ(n)
t,µt) = 0for every compact set K⊂T;
(iii) (µ(n)
t)∧(ξ)→/hatwideµt(ξ)(n→ ∞) uniformly in (ξ,t)on each compact subset of Rd×T;
(iv)for each ﬁxed ξ∈Rd,(µ(n)
t)∧(ξ)→/hatwideµt(ξ)(n→ ∞) uniformly in ton each compact
subset of T.
Proof.We begin with a simple observation. Let K⊂Tbe compact and ( t(n))n∈Nbe a
sequence in Kwhich converges to some u. By assumption, µt(n)w− →µuasn→ ∞. Then
each one of (i)–(iv) yields µ(n)
t(n)w− →µu. For example, if (iv) holds, then for each ξ∈Rd,
|(µ(n)
t(n))∧(ξ)−/hatwiderµu(ξ)| ≤ |(µ(n)
t(n))∧(ξ)−/hatwidestµt(n)(ξ)|+|/hatwidestµt(n)(ξ)−/hatwiderµu(ξ)|
≤sup
t∈K|(µ(n)
t)∧(ξ)−/hatwideµt(ξ)|+|/hatwidestµt(n)(ξ)−/hatwiderµu(ξ)| →0,
which implies µ(n)
t(n)w− →µuby L´ evy’s continuity theorem.
Nowassumethatoneof (i)–(iv)fails. Thenthereexist acompactse tK⊂T, apositive
numberε, and an increasing sequence ( n(k))k∈NinNsuch that supt∈KD(µ(n(k))
t,µt)≥2ε.
Here,D(µ,ν) is one of
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
f dµ−/integraldisplay
f dν/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle, ρ(µ,ν),sup
ξ∈B|ˆµ(ξ)−ˆν(ξ)|,|ˆµ(ξ)−ˆν(ξ)|
for some f∈Cb(S) in the ﬁrst and for some compact B⊂Rdin the third expression,
according to which of (i)–(iv) is assumed to fail. Then, taking a furth er subsequence of
(n(k))k∈Nif necessary, we can choose a sequence ( t(k))k∈NinKwhich converges to some u
so thatD(µ(n(k))
t(k),µt(k))≥ε. This implies that all of (i)–(iv) fail by the previous observa-
tion. Indeed, if µt(k)w− →µuandµ(n(k))
t(k)w− →µuoccur at the same time, then D(µ(n(k))
t(k),µt(k))
must go to zero as k→ ∞. Thus the theorem is proved.
Remark 3.2. By the ﬁrst paragraph of this section, Conditions (i)–(iii) are mutua lly
equivalent if (( µ(n)
t)t∈T)n∈Nis replaced by a net (( µ(α)
t)t∈T)α∈AinC(T;M(S)) as in Corol-
lary 2.2. In Theorem 3.1, we have been concerned with sequences on ly so as to remove
thet-continuity assumption on(( µ(n)
t)t∈T)n∈Nand, furthermore, to include the ξ-pointwise
condition (iv). Thus, the topological method in Section 2 and sequen tial method in the
present section do not completely include each other.
44 Vague convergence of probability measures and
convergence of moments
Keeping Remark 3.2 in mind, we follow the ideas in Sections 2 and 3 to discu ss two more
situations, in which the values of the functions at issue are probabilit y measures. The
proof of Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 below is quite similar to that of Theorem 3 .1 and thus
omitted. Let P(S) be the set of Borel probability measures on a topological space S.
First, we focus on the vague convergence of probability measures . Suppose that Sis a
locally compact second countable Hausdorﬀ space. This is the same a s saying that Sis a
locallycompact Polishspace(i.e., spacewhichisseparableandmetrizablewithacomplete
metric); e.g., see [2, Remark 5, §29]. The weak topologyon M(S) is then metrizable (with
theLevy–Prokhorovdistanceaswehavealreadymentioned). Now letC∞(S)(resp.Cc(S))
denote the set of continuous real functions on Svanishing at inﬁnity (resp. with compact
support), and deﬁne U′(resp.U′′) as the uniformity on M(S) generated by the collection
of sets (2.1) indexed by f∈C∞(S) (resp.Cc(S)) andε >0. Then the topology induced
byU′′is called the vague topology on M(S). As is seen in Remark 4.1 below, on P(S)
the vague topology coincides with the weak one; in other words, the uniformities U,U′,
andU′′restricted to P(S) induce the same topology. By Proposition 2.1, the topology
of uniform convergence on compacta on the space C(T;P(S)) is the same if we take any
one of these uniformities.
Remark 4.1. A nice exposition on the vague topology can be found in, e.g., Bauer’s
book [2, §30–31]. As a premise, it is natural to consider the vague topology on the set
ofRadonmeasures, but in our case, every ﬁnite Borel measure on Sis indeed Radon
becauseSis assumed to be a locally compact second countable Hausdorﬀ space . Then it
is well known [2, Corollary 30.9] that a sequence ( µn)n∈NinP(S) converges vaguely to a
measure µ∈P(S) if and only if it converges weakly to µ. This implies that the identity
mapping on P(S), with the domain and codomain equipped with the vague and weak
topologies, respectively, is sequentially bi-continuous. Moreover, the vague topology on
P(S) is metrizable [2, Theorem 31.5] as well as the weak one. Thus, the ide ntity mapping
above is homeomorphic, which means that the vague topology coincid es with the weak
one onP(S). Note that this is no longer valid on the larger space M(S); see examples in
the same book [2, Remarks 1 and 2, §30].
The sequential counterpart to the preceding topological discuss ion is the following:
Theorem 4.2. LetSbe a locally compact Hausdorﬀ space and Tbe a topological space.
Suppose that µ(n)
t∈P(S)for each t∈Tand for each n∈Nand(µt)t∈T∈C(T;P(S)).
Designate the following condition as (C⋆)for⋆∈ {b,∞,c}:(1.1)holds for every compact
K⊂Tand for every f∈C⋆(S). Then the three conditions (C⋆),⋆∈ {b,∞,c}, are
mutually equivalent.
Next, we focus on the convergence of moments. Let ( S,d) be a complete separable
metric space. Fora ﬁxed p≥1, we deﬁne Pp(S,d) asthe set of Borel probability measures
with ﬁnite p-th moment. More precisely, Pp(S,d) :={µ∈P(S) :/integraltext
Sd(x0,x)pµ(dx)<
5+∞}for some x0∈S. Here, the deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of x0. For
µ∈Pp(S,d), we put mp(µ) :=/integraltext
Sd(x0,x)pµ(dx).
OnPp(S,d) a uniformity Upis generated by the collection of sets
Up(f,ε) :=/braceleftbigg
(µ,ν)∈Pp(S,d)2:/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
f dµ−/integraldisplay
f dν/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle+|mp(µ)−mp(ν)|< ε/bracerightbigg
indexed by f∈Cb(S) andε >0. LetTpdenote the topology of the uniform space
(Pp(S,d),Up). Then lim αµα=µinTpif and only if the pair of the conditions µαw→µ
andmp(µα)→mp(µ) holds.
The topology Tpcan be given in diﬀerent ways. Let ρbe a distance which induces
the weak topology on P(S). Then the distance
ρp(µ,ν) :=ρ(µ,ν)+|mp(µ)−mp(ν)|, µ,ν ∈Pp(S,d),
induces the topology Tp. It is known as well (see Villani [17, Chapter 6] for example)
that the p-Wasserstein distance WponPp(S,d) induces Tp.
By Proposition 2.1, the topology of uniform convergence on compac ta on the space
C(T;Pp(S,d)) of continuous mappings from TtoPp(S,d) is the same if we take any
one of the above constructions to give a uniformity on Pp(S,d). Moreover, this space is
metrizable if Tis locally compact σ-compact as in Corollary 2.2 (ii).
The sequential counterpart is given as follows:
Theorem 4.3. Let(S,d)be a complete separable metric space, Tbe a topological space,
andρbe a distance inducing the weak topology on P(S). Suppose that µ(n)
t∈Pp(S,d)
for each t∈Tand for each n∈Nand(µt)t∈T∈C(T;Pp(S,d)). Then the following are
mutually equivalent:
(i) (1.1) andlimn→∞supt∈K|mp(µ(n)
t)−mp(µt)|= 0hold for every compact K⊂Tand
for every f∈Cb(S);
(ii) lim n→∞supt∈Kρ(µ(n)
t,µt) = 0andlimn→∞supt∈K|mp(µ(n)
t)−mp(µt)|= 0hold for
every compact K⊂T;
(iii) lim n→∞supt∈KWp(µ(n)
t,µt) = 0holds for every compact K⊂T.
5 Application I: convergence of additive processes
We now observe the relation of our results to a functional limit theor em in probability
theory. Let X= (Xt)t≥0be a one-dimensional additive process, that is, an a.s.-c´ adl´ ag and
stochastically continuous process with independent increments. I n the L´ evy–Khintchine
representation
E[eiξXt] = exp/bracketleftbigg
iγtξ+/integraldisplay
R/parenleftbigg
eiξx−1−iξx
1+x2/parenrightbigg1+x2
x2ηt(dx)/bracketrightbigg
, ξ∈R,(5.1)
let us call the family of ( γt,ηt)∈R×M(R),t≥0, thegenerating family ofX. The
function t/mapsto→γtis continuous non-decreasing with γ0= 0, and t/mapsto→ηtis setwise continuous
non-decreasing, which means that t/mapsto→ηt(B) is continuous non-decreasing for every Borel
setB∈B(R), withη0= 0 (cf. [11, 12, 16]).
6Remark 5.1. Compared to the multidimensional formula (5.7) below, the Gaussian c o-
eﬃcient in (5.1) is given by ηt({0}); here, the value of the integrand at x= 0 is assigned
as the limit

The next proposition is taken from Jacod and Shiryaev [12, Theorem VII.3.4 and
Corollary VII.4.43], adapted to the one-dimensional case.
Proposition 5.2. LetX(n)= (X(n)
t)t≥0,n∈N, andX= (Xt)t≥0be one-dimensional ad-
ditive processes and (γ(n)
t,η(n)
t)t≥0and(γt,ηt)t≥0be their generating families, respectively.
Then the following are mutually equivalent:
(i)X(n)d− →Xin Skorokhod’s J1-topology as n→ ∞;
(ii)The generating families satisfy
lim
n→∞sup
t∈[0,T]|γ(n)
t−γt|= 0for each T >0and (5.2)
w-lim
n→∞η(n)
t=ηtfor each t≥0; (5.3)
(iii)The generating families satisfy (5.2)and
lim
n→∞sup
t∈[0,T]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
Rf(x)η(n)

Rf(x)ηt(dx)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle= 0
for each T >0and for each f∈Cb(R);(5.4)
(iv)The characteristic function E[exp(iξX(n)
t)]converges to E[exp(iξXt)]locally uni-
formly in (ξ,t)∈R×[0,+∞)asn→ ∞;
(v)The characteristic function E[exp(iξX(n)
t)]converges to E[exp(iξXt)]locally uni-
formly in t∈[0,+∞)asn→ ∞for each ξ∈R.
In Proposition 5.2, let µ(n)
tandµtbe the distributions of X(n)
tandXt, respectively.
Then Condition (iv) or (v) is equivalent to ( µ(n)
t)t≥0→(µt)t≥0inC([0,+∞);P(R))
by Theorem 3.1. Moreover, (5.4) means that ( η(n)
t)t≥0→(ηt)t≥0inC([0,+∞);M(R)).
Hence, if a sequence of additive processes converges to an additiv e process, then the ﬁnite
measures in the L´ evy–Khintchine representation as well as the ma rginal distributions of
the processes converge locally uniformly in time parameter.
Remark 5.3. InProposition5.2, theconditions(5.3)and(5.4)areequivalentbeca useη(n)
t
andηtare setwise continuous and non-decreasing in t. In fact, a theorem of P´ olya [15]
asserts that, if a sequence of right-continuous non-decreasing functions Fn,n∈N, on
[0,+∞) converges to a continuous function Fpointwise with Fn(0) =F(0) = 0, then
(Fn)n∈Nconverges to Flocallyuniformlyon[0 ,+∞). Fromthistheoremweeasilyseethat
(5.3) implies (5.4), decomposing a test function f∈Cb(R) into the positive and negative
parts. Since the marginal distributions µ(n)
tof the processes X(n)
thave no monotonicity
int, we cannot drop t-uniformity in the convergence of (( µ(n)
t)t≥0)n∈N.
7In relation to Remark 5.3, there is still another condition equivalent t o (5.3) or (5.4).
To state this, we recall that t/mapsto→ηt(B) is continuous, non-decreasing for every B∈B(R).
Then there exists a unique σ-ﬁnite Borel measure HonR×[0,+∞) that enjoys
H(B×(s,t]) =ηt(B)−ηs(B) for B∈B(R) and 0≤s≤t,(5.5)
H(R×[0,t])<+∞andH(R×{t}) = 0 for t≥0. (5.6)
Indeed, ( x,t)/mapsto→ηt((−∞,x] (=H((−∞,x]×[0,t])) is a two-dimensional distribution
function (cf. Billingsley [6, Theorem 12.5]). Using this H, we show the following:
Theorem 5.4. Let(ηt)t≥0and(η(n)
t)t≥0,n∈N, be mappings from [0,+∞)toM(R)with
η0=η(n)
0= 0which are nondecreasing and continuous in tsetwise. Let Hbe theσ-ﬁnite
measure deﬁned by (5.5)and(5.6). For each n, letH(n)be the measure deﬁned by (5.5)
and(5.6)with the superscript(n)put onηandH. Then the following are equivalent:
(i) (5.3) or(5.4)holds;
(ii)H(n)|R×[0,T]w− → H|R×[0,T]holds for each T >0.
Proof.Since
/integraldisplay
R×[0,T]f(x)H(n)(dxdt) =/integraldisplay
Rf(x)η(n)
T(dx), f∈Cb(R),
Condition (ii) implies (5.3). Conversely, suppose (5.3). Then repeatin g the proof of
(G2)⇒(G3) in Hasebe and Hotta [8, Proposition 2.6], we see that H(n)|R×[0,T]converges
vaguely to H|R×[0,T]asn→ ∞. Moreover, the total mass H(n)(R×[0,T]) =η(n)
T(R)
converges to H(R×[0,T]) =ηT(R) by (5.3). Hence (ii) follows.
For multidimensional additive processes, the same property as Pro position 5.2 holds
true, except that the pair ( γt,ηt) in (5.1) should be replaced by the characteristic triplet.
Namely, the following expression is adopted:
E[eiξ·Xt] = exp/bracketleftbigg

Here,Ctis the Gaussian covariance matrix, h:Rd→Rdis a truncation function [12,
p.75], and νtis a L´ evy measure. Then
˜Ct:=Ct−/integraldisplay
Rdh(x)⊗h(x)νt(dx)
is called the modiﬁed second characteristic [12, p.115]. The multidimens ional version
of Proposition 5.2 states that the locally uniform convergences of a dditive processes, of
modiﬁedtriplets, andofmarginaldistributions(oftheprocesses) areallequivalent; forthe
precise statement, see Jacod and Shiryaev [12, Theorem VII.3.4 an d Corollary VII.4.43].
Remark 5.5. An analogue to Proposition 5.2 is formulated for a sequence of rando m
walks constructed by an inﬁnitesimal triangular array in Hata’s thes is [10]. Similar results
were proved even on a Lie group; see Feinsilver [7].
86 Application II: Bercovici–Pata bijection for non-
commutative additive processes
In this section, we describe the role of our results in non-commutat ive probability theory,
which has motivated us originally.
In non-commutative probability, we have ﬁve standard “independe nces”: classical,
free, boolean, monotone, and anti-monotone ones. The symbols ∗,⊞,⊎,⊲, and⊳denote
convolution of Borel probability measures on Rwith respect to these independences,
respectively. Bercovici and Pata [5] gave a canonical bijection bet ween the ∗-,⊞-, and
⊎-inﬁnitely divisible distributions, which was later extended to the ⊲-inﬁnitely divisible
distributions [1].
Hasebe and Hotta [8] gave a dynamical version of the Bercovici–Pat a bijection,
which is a correspondence between the marginal distributions of cla ssical, free, boolean,
and monotone additive2)processes on the unit circle T. Moreover, they proved that
the bijection is continuous with respect to the convergence (1.1) w ithS=Tand
T= [0,+∞)2
≤:={(s,t) : 0≤s≤t}. In our companion paper [9], we shall estab-
lish similar results for processes on R. Below we announce part of the results related to
the present article.
Let⋆denote one of the convolutions ∗,⊞,⊎, and⊲. A family ( µs,t)0≤s≤t∈
C([0,+∞)2
≤;P(R)) is called a ⋆-convolution hemigroup ifµs,s=δ0,s≥0, and if µs,u=
µs,t⋆µt,u, 0≤s≤t≤u. If(Xt)t≥0isa⋆-additiveprocess, thenthedistributions µs,tofthe
increments Xt−Xs, 0≤s≤t, form a⋆-convolution hemigroup. We deﬁne CH( ⋆) as the
set of⋆-convolution hemigroups and set CH 2(⋆) :={(µs,t)0≤s≤t∈CH(⋆) :µs,t∈P2(R)}.
In the next proposition, P2(R) =P2(R,d) is equipped with the topology T2in Section 4
withdbeing the Euclidean distance.
Proposition 6.1 ([9]).There exists a “canonical” bijection between CH2(∗)andCH2(⊲),
which is homeomorphicwith respect to the relative topologi es inC([0,+∞)2
≤;P2(R)). Sim-
ilarly, there exists a bijection between CH(∗),CH(⊞), andCH(⊎), homeomorphic with
respect to the relative topologies in C([0,+∞)2
≤;P(R)).
Basically, the bijection CH 2(∗)∋(cs,t)s,t/mapsto→(ms,t)s,t∈CH2(⊲) in Proposition 6.1
is obtained by identifying the generating family of the classical additiv e process whose
marginal distributions are c0,t,t≥0, with the “generating family” of ( ms,t)s,t, which will
be newly deﬁned in the paper [9]. Then the choice of the topology in Pro position 6.1
should be natural in view of Proposition 5.2.
Remark 6.2. Hasebe and Hotta [8] showed a version of Proposition 6.1 on Tin the
following form: there exists a certain bijection β, and it is sequentially bi-continuous , i.e.,
(µ(n)
s,t)s,t→(µs,t)s,t(n→ ∞)⇐⇒β/parenleftbig
(µ(n)
s,t)s,t/parenrightbig
→β/parenleftbig
(µs,t)s,t/parenrightbig
(n→ ∞).
By virtue of Corollary 2.2 (ii), this now implies genuine continuity.
2)As the group T={eiθ:θ∈R}is concerned, they are actually “multiplicative”.

parameters, but another interpretation is possible. For example, Kawabe [13] interpreted
a continuous function λ:T→M(S),t/mapsto→λ(t,ds) as a transition probability kernel from
TtoS. Let(µα)α∈Abeanetofinitialdistributionson Tand(λα)α∈Abeanetoftransition
probability kernels. He studied, using uniform structures on M(S) and their relation to
the topology of C(T;M(S)), in what case the net of the compound probability measures/integraltext
Tλα(t,·)µα(dt) converge.
Bengs and Holzmann [3, 4] studied the uniform convergence of a seq uence of families
of distributions ( µϑ
n:ϑ∈Θ),n∈N, onRdin the context of statistics. They assumed
that the parameter set Θhas no topological structure and the limit family ( µϑ:ϑ∈
Θ) is “uniformly absolutely continuous” with respect to a ﬁxed atomles s distribution.
Their assumption is thus completely diﬀerent from ours; neverthele ss, they proved the
corresponding version of L´ evy’s continuity theorem as well as the portmanteau theorem
and central limit theorem.
