In the present work, a consistent Lagrangian model that encapsulates fully kinetic
ions and gyrokinetic electrons for solar wind electromagnetic turbulence is formulated.
Using a consistent method, where both electrons and protons are treated with the same
mathematical formalism, we derive and implement a model in which high frequency
waves and kinetic electrons eﬀects are described in a computationally cost-eﬃcient way.
To that aim, higher order Lie-transform perturbation methods applied to Hamiltonian
formulation of guiding center motion are used in order to describe the dynamics of
particles and ﬁelds. Furthermore, the use of a Hamiltonian formulation allow us to
introduce an abelian and gauge invariant electromagnetic ﬁeld theory for the closure
of the system.
1. Introduction
Plasma turbulence is germane in astrophysics and space physics (Roberto Bruno
(2016);Kallenrode(2001);J.GKirk(1994)).Inweaklymagnetizedandweaklycollisional
plasma, empirical data suggests that kinetic eﬀects play a pivotal role in understanding
how energy is dissipated at ion and electron scales (Alexandrova et al.(2009); Jiansen He
(2019); Chen et al.(2019)). Space plasma physics is idiosyncratically suitable for the
understanding of turbulence because it oﬀers a vast range of frequency scales and the
possibility of in situmeasurements with various spacecraft missions (Alexandrova et al.
(2009); Dudok de Wit (2019); Zhao (2019); Bowen (2019)). The Parker Solar Probe
is the most recent of these missions (Parashar (2019); Bandyopadhyay (2019)). Early
data suggests that even at distances as close as 30 to 50 R, the power spectral density
indicates that the transport of energy from large scales into thermal heat is already
mediated through kinetic turbulent eﬀects (Bale S.D. (2019); Huang & et al (2019);
Martinović (2019)).
Energy dissipation in kinetic scales is a yet unresolved problem in space physics
(Roberto Bruno (2016)). Currently, the standard picture is that energy is injected in
the system in the largest scale, and it is then transported to the smallest scales, where
it is transformed to thermal energy (Chiuderi & Velli (2015); Jiansen He (2019)). In
the process of dissipation, the statistically isotropic inertial range is elegantly described
by Magnetohydrodynamics (Goossens (2003); Hans Goedbloed (2019)). At the smallest
scales, kinetic eﬀects take place (David & Galtier (2019)). Contrary to prior assumption,
the temperature of the solar wind at 1AU is higher than adiabatic expansion predicts

(Marsch E. & Richter (1982), Kohl (1998)), and in this case, kinetic turbulent eﬀects
might be playing an important role.
Particle heating happens in plasma physics due to irreversible thermodynamic pro-
cesses and the property of time reversal symmetry of physical laws. Together with the
well formulated Onsager reciprocity theorem (Callen (1985)), and the natural tendency
of isolated systems to always evolve towards maximum entropy, it allows us to better
understand how energy is dissipated. In collisional astrophysical plasma turbulence, the
mechanism responsible for energy dissipation in the inertial range is viscous dissipation
(Morini (2008)). The picture changes in the kinetic scales, where frictional conversion
of the bulk energy does not completely explain how energy dissipation takes place. In
this case, wave particle interaction should be taken into account (R. Bruno 2016). The
wave particle interaction forms structures in the velocity space distribution function
(Pezzi et al.(2016)), which in turn increase the collisional energy dissipation eﬃcacy
(Schreiner & Saur (2017)). Among the reversible energy transfer channels between
waves and particle, the resonant ones take place when the particle gyrating around the
magnetic ﬁeld resonates with the wave’s frequency, and it can happen in the format
of Landau damping (Pitaevskii & Lifshitz (2012)), cyclotron damping (Olson (1972)),
etc. Non resonant eﬀects takes place in the form of, e. g. stochastic heating or magnetic
pumping(Martinović et al.(2019),Gerwin(1966)).Whetherornotrelaxationsinvelocity
space distribution function explains energy dissipation completely remains to be further
investigated. Nevertheless, a more meticulous investigation of irreversible processes must
be done in the framework of weakly collisional energy dissipation in order to properly
understand the values of solar wind temperature measured (Verscharen D. & Maruca
(2019)). In moving forward, it is important to keep in mind previous work that aimed
at modeling a similar phenomena to the one we would like to reproduce. The GKe/FKi
(Lin et al.(2005)) was proposed in order to bridge the gap between ﬂuid/kinetic hybrid
models and fully kinetic models. Unlike the model proposed in the present work, the
parameter space of the derivation is not appropriate for simulating turbulence in space
and astrophysical plasma. Furthermore, the derivation of the ﬁeld equations follows a
pull-back/push-forward approach, whereas the present work uses a variational approach,
which we expect to yield better conservation properties.
In order to better investigate solar wind turbulence at high frequency scales, we
are going to develop a theoretical framework focused on turbulent kinetic eﬀects. We
are going to derive a hybrid system consisting of a fully kinetic and a gyrokinetic
particle species. The gyrokinetic theory is an asymptotic limit of kinetic theory for
magnetized plasmas. In this approach, a perturbation expansion is done in order to
eliminate theta dependency up to a chosen ordering and make sure that the magnetic
momentum is conserved when the background magnetic ﬁeld is stronger than the various
plasma perturbations. The present work is the ﬁrst in a series that aims at building a
electromagnetic nonlinear hybrid fully kinetic and gyrokinetic model.
In the present work, we make use of a mathematical apparatus available in diﬀerential
geometry. It is important to highlight here that the use of diﬀerential geometric tools
not only allow us to derive acceptable energy and momentum conservation properties.
It also grant us the possibility to ensure the preservation of the whole hierarchy of
structures in the system. Beyond the conservation of energy and momentum, one is
also capable of preserving the symplectic capacity, diﬀerential forms under Hamiltonian
evolution, and conservation laws as derived from the Noether theorem. What is more,
it allow us to describe a system that encapsulates organically a geometric description of
thermodynamics through contact geometry, the even counterpart of symplectic geometry
(Arnold (1990)).Hybrid Gyrokinetic Hamiltonian Field Theory 3
This work is organized as follows: In Section 2 we are going to perform a detailed
geometrical derivation of fully kinetic physics, looking on how the symplectic structure
emerges in this theoretical framework and how it allow us to work with the Poisson
brackets in order to derive the dynamics of the system. We continue then to section 3,
whereweworkwiththetruncatedequationsforthefullykineticspecies,andproceedwith
the derivation of the gyrokinetic equations of motion. It is worth to emphasize here that
beyond the phenomenology of the physical problem we are trying tackle, our gyrokinetic
equations should be somewhat similar to the gyrokinetics found in the literature. The
noveltyofthepresentapproachisfoundonhowthefullykineticequationsarestructurally
connected to the reduced ones and the ﬁelds, and how this aﬀects the breadth and scope
of the model. In section 4 we construct the gyrokinetic Vlasov equation. After that, in
section 5, we derive the ﬁeld equations with the variational principle, and we ﬁnish the
work in section 6, with a linear electrostatic analysis.
In 1958, F. E. Low published what was to be known as the ﬁrst lagrangian formulation
of the Boltzmann-Vlasov equations (Low & Chandrasekhar (1958)). In his work, he
emphasized that regardless of no new calculations being performed, the approach would
produce a new way to attack practical problems. Inspired by that attitude, the present
work does not aim to provide new physics. Nevertheless, we do expect that our hybrid
approach allow us to model higher frequency scales, providing a more accurate yet cost-
beneﬁcial alternative to standard models.
2. Geometrical Hamiltonian Mechanics
In this section, we are going to derive the fully kinetic segment of our model. At the
same time, we lay down the theoretical framework used in the present work. One expects
that the robustness of the mathematical apparatus used here would help us to tackle
more complex problems, such as energy dissipation and heating or, as in the case of
gyrokinetics, speciﬁc coordinate transformations.
From a physical perspective, our goal is to describe the equations of motion for the
particles in the system. That means position and velocity, or position and momentum,
and all emergent properties. Mathematically, those quantities represent coordinates on
a given space. Here it is important to stress the elementary connection and distinction
between mathematics and physics. Mathematics seeks to understand relationships among
abstract structures, whereas physics utilizes said structural relationships to investigate
the property and behavior of matter and forces through space and time. Henceforth, it is
important to understand how this two subjects relate to each other and subsequently
coalesce, inasmuch as we base our motivation both in a mathematical and physical
argument.
In the classical non-relativistic case, one establishes a correspondence between a
physical coordinate description and operations with geometrical objects on a manifold,
where a manifold is a locally-euclidean topological space (Arnold (1989), Wasserman
(2004)). The physical reality is represented by coordinates on the conﬁguration space,
described in our case on a symplectic manifold. A symplectic manifold is a topological
space that allows for the existence of a closed nondegenerated symplectic two-form, !.
Symplectic manifolds are special case of a Poisson manifolds, we shall make use of this
property in the following steps. A diﬀerential form is a coordinate independent tensorial
description of integrands over a diﬀerentiable manifold. In our case, the symplectic two-
formallowustogeneralizetheconceptofareafrommultivariablecalculus,toacoordinate
free symplectic manifold. The non-degenerancy of the symplectic form allows for the
existence of its inverse, which is in turn used for the construction of the Poisson bracket.4 F. N. deOliveira-Lopes, et al.
We are going to describe in more detail this relationships and its ramiﬁcations in the
following sections.
Beyond the idiosyncratic lexicon, it is important to understand the procedure being
described here. For that aim, we wish to use the following section as a toy model
to better understand the mathematical framework used in the gyrokinetic derivation
and the derivation of the ﬁeld equations. We aim to build our theoretical framework
by constructing a correspondence between elements of our physical system with more
general geometric structures. Such connection will allows us to better understand the
fundamental properties of the nature of problem in question.
2.1.Symplectic and Cosymplectic approach
In order to derive the equations of motions of the fully kinetic particles, we need to
understand how the symplectic two-form relates to our physical system and how it can be
used to extract further information about the phenomena we wish to study. An intuitive
way to construct our symplectic matrix, is looking at what it represents geometrically.
Consider a symplectic vector space Viand a linear map t2(Vi;Vj), whereVis a vector
space andL2is the space of all bilinear maps from VVto R. A map is considered
nondegenerate if for !(v1;v2) = 0for allv22V, we must also have v1= 0. If we
describe the basis and dual basis of the given vector space as (e1;:::;en)and(e1;:::;en),
respectively, the map !is nondegenerate if the matrix of !ij=w(ei;ej)is nonsingular.
The map is symmetric if its transpose is !t(ei;ej) =!(ei;ej)and skew-symmetric if
!t= !. Consider now a space of skew-symmetric bilinear maps on V, and within it, a
non-degenerated 2-form !2A2(V). In its basis, the matrix !(ei;ej)has the form

transform with 2L(V1;V2). In the present derivation, we deﬁne the phase-space of an
autonomous system as a symplectic manifold (M;! )and the dynamics of the system is
described as one-parameter family of symplectomorphisms. The form used to describe
the time evolution of the system on the manifold M is closed, i.e. d!= 0, and exact,
i.e.!=d. If we deﬁne = , where =Ldtis our phase space Lagrangian one-
form, and the tautological one-form provides a bridge between the Lagrangian and the
Hamiltonian mechanics. The use of such a formalism also allow us to gauge transform our
Lagrangian, and as far as the gauge functions can be described as a exterior derivatives,
i.e.d, the dynamics of the system remains unchanged. This feature will become clear
on the gyrokinetic transformation reduction. In this case, the general symplectic map
from two symplectic manifolds (M1;!1)and(M2;!2)is a canonical transformation if

For a given integral curve of the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld g(t), we have that H(g(t))is
constant in time for an autonomous system, and the ﬂow ftof the vector ﬁeld satisﬁes
H_ft=H8t. Using the Liouville theorem, we have that f
t!=!, andd=dtf
t!= 0.
Our ﬂow is then symplectic and preserves the volume element given by the orientation

mapswill be symplectic only if it satisﬁes s(XH) =XHs.
We consider a vector ﬁeld on a symplectic manifolds to be at least locally Hamiltonian
if the Lie derivative of the symplectic form with respect to the vector ﬁeld X is zero, that
means
LX!= 0: (2.10)
Insofar as the Lie derivative describe inﬁnitesimal changes of any given tensors with
respect to any given vector ﬁeld, the equation above help us to describe a vector ﬁeld
that locally conserves the symplectic structure. For any given functions on our manifold,
f;g2(M;R), the Lie derivative LXgg= LXffdeﬁnes the Poisson Bracket of the
following form6 F. N. deOliveira-Lopes, et al.
ff;gg!= !(Xf;Xg):
The group of all symplectomorphisms of a symplectic vector space forms a group
under composition called the symplectic group Sp(M;! ), and any symplectmorphic map
belonging to (M;! )must also preserve the Poisson Bracket structure, which is in fact a
more fundamental structure belonging to a Poisson manifold and a Poisson algebra. It is
important to highlight that the use of a Poisson geometry emphasizes the Lie structure
of the system through the use of a Lie Bracket, or a Poisson Bracket in this speciﬁc
case, and therefore it is more suitable for the description of a system endowed with a
Hamiltonian structure.

In order to construct the Vlasov equation, we should evaluate the Liouville’s Theorem

It is important to emphasize here that, despite the recognized outcome of this calcu-

favourable for a coherent gyrokinetic coordination reduction. This is due to the fact that
we start the transformation from the tautological one-form deﬁned by the Lagrangian

The full gyrokinetic coordinate reduction used in the present model is derived in
detail in Appendix B. In the present section, the Lagrangian resulting from Appendix B
is embedded in the sum of the phase spaces of all the variable required to describe the8 F. N. deOliveira-Lopes, et al.

the fully kinetics dynamics, which is represented by Lp

5. Field Equations
In order to derive the ﬁeld equations of our system, we start from the principle that
our system lies on a heterogeneous manifold (Taeyoung Lee (2018)), which is understood
to be heterogeneous because it serves as the phase space for our fully kinetic ions and
electromagnetic ﬁelds, as well as for our coordinate reduced gyrokinetic electrons. The
missing piece of our derivation is what connects the fully kinetic and the gyrokinetic
dynamics, i. e. the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Here, we consider that the ﬁeld Lagrangian
lives in the same manifold as the fully kinetic particles.
The approach taken for the derivation of the ﬁeld equations relies on the use of the
variational principle. More speciﬁcally, we are going to use the following relationship,
known as the functional derivative
S[(
)]
(
)^(
) = 0: (5.1)
Here,Sstands for the action of the system, (
)is the ﬁeld with which we are
varying our system, and ^(
)is a testing ﬁeld. For a detailed derivation of the functional
derivative in the context of heterogeneous manifolds, we refer the reader to (deOliveira
Lopes (2022)). Using the same notation described in Appendix B, and considering that
the electromagnetic ﬁeld does not lie in the same manifold of our gyrokinetic system,
i.e.(
= (x;v), and
gy= (Xgy;vkgy;gy;)), in order to perform the variation on the
same coordinate system, we must make a transformation such as

An important requirement of perturbation theory is the proper understanding of the
diﬀerent orderings imposed on the system and how they aﬀect the ﬁnal set of equations
one aims to implement numerically. In the next sections, we perform the variation of
the full action with respect to the diﬀerent ﬁeld potentials in order to derive the ﬁeld
equations of our hybrid system.
5.1.Poisson Equation
We start with the derivation of the Poisson equation. Applying the tools discussed
on the previous section, we perform the variation of the actions with respect to the the
electric potential.
In order to derive the gyrokinetic Poisson equation, one needs to perform the variation12 F. N. deOliveira-Lopes, et al.
with respect to the perturbed electric potential, i.e. S=1. In this case, all terms 1-
independent vanish, and we are left with the contributions from the electric part of the
electromagnetic potential  1, and the electric contribution from the fully and gyrokinetic
action. We are going to ﬁrst perform the variation with respect to the perturbed electric
potential on the gyrokinetic action.
We start with the derivation of the standard Poisson equation in vacuum using the
functional derivative approach on the ﬁeld action.

sidering that the electromagnetic potential contain terms depending on v?andvk, it is
natural to assume that the integration in velocity space yields special prefactors. For the
terms associated with the magnetic potential, a current term arises, and a gyrokinetic
polarization density factor appears for the term associated with the electric potential.

6. Linear Analysis
Despitethevastcomplexityandmyriadofphysicalphenomenatakingplaceinthesolar
wind, in the plasma physics framework, an interesting and eﬀective exercise to validate a
model consists of performing a wave analysis. Waves are connected with energy transfer,
but not necessarily dissipation, and are often present in turbulent systems (Roberts et al.
(2020), Somov (2006)). In the present section we are going to perform a linear analysis
in order to study the waves present in our model.
For that aim, we have modiﬁed the solver FIDEL (Gaisbauer (2018)) and we will make
a comparison with two other linear solvers, the fully kinetic one DSHARK (Astfalk P
& F (2015)) and the hybrid kinetic-ion/ﬂuid-electron code HYDROS (D. Told (2016)).
We take a look at three main wave solutions that are of interest in the ﬁeld of space
physics, i.e. ion Bernstein waves, the limiting case of the highest frequency electrostatic
lower hybrid wave and ion acoustic waves.
6.1.Ion Acoustic Waves
Ion acoustic waves (IAW) are a longitudinal oscillation of charged particles in the
plasma similar to acoustic waves on neutral gas. IAW are subject to strong Landau
damping, that means that they represent an indispensable class of waves that could
be involved in the energy dissipation mechanism of solar wind. They can also interact
with the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Such waves can be damped due to Coulomb collisions or
Landau damping.
In the present work, we took a look on IAW with a recently modiﬁed version of FIDEL,
where we have included also the Maxwellian Laplacian in the Poisson equation, derived
in the previous section. The Maxwellian Laplacian refers to the Laplacian on the Poisson
equation that does not have a coeﬃcient. This modiﬁcation allows us to better study high
frequency waves, a point that will be discussed in more detail. The linear property of
the wave is observed in Figure 1. For high values of wave number k, a diﬀerence between
kinetic and ﬂuid models is already observed. In this case, because the ﬂuid framework
does not capture the complete kinetic physics, perpendicular damping rates are not fully
captured for low wavelength values.20 F. N. deOliveira-Lopes, et al.
Figure 2. Perpendicular ( = 85) Ion Acoustic Wave frequency (top) and damping rate
(bottom) for HYDROS (dark blue), DSHARK (green), and Fidel (light blue).
For a plasma with ion temperature smaller than electron temperature, and assuming
a large wavelength limit, the dispersion relation takes the form of

wherecs,De, andB, represents the sound speed, Debye length and Boltzmann

Lopes (2022)). It is important to emphasize that IAW propagates with constant velocity,
where the velocity lies between the thermal velocities of the species present on the
medium. Our model also allow us to take a look at parallel propagating IAW.
The Landau damping of IAW and has been extensively discussed in (Liyan & Jiulin
(2008)), where Landau damping strength is proportional to the ion thermal speed. The
presence of IAW has also been associated with the increase of electron distribution
anisotropy (Urnnet & Frank (1978)), and also solar wind heating (Kellogg (2020)).

With that in mind, we also take a look on how our model compares to the analytic
solution, cf. Figure 3. The agreement for low values of wave number is in accord with
pastFIDELresults.WiththeadditionoftheMaxwellianLaplacian,weareabletoextend
this agreement to higher values if k. As seen in Figure 3, this agreement does not hold
for higher values of k. This happens likely due to the limitation imposed by the reduced
model.
The presence of IAW modes in our model represent an important milestone in devel-
oping a reduced framework that is capable of, at a reduced computational cost, describe
important kinetic phenomena which might be of great relevance to better understand
the problem of energy dissipation in solar wind.Hybrid Gyrokinetic Hamiltonian Field Theory 21

damping rate (bottom) for diﬀerent IBW modes
6.2.Ion Bernstein Waves
Ion Bernstein waves (IBW) are slowly propagating, longitudinal hot plasma waves.
Such waves interact with kinetic Alfven waves (KAW) (Podesta (2012)), and are subject
to strong localized electron Landau damping (Ono (1993)). Although their nature spurs
out of the electromagnetic theory, it is interesting to observe that IBWs can already be
observed in the present reduced model. In Figure 4 we observe a comparison between

The agreement between both codes indicates that the reduced model is also capable of
reproducing important fully kinetic linear features. It’s imperative to have a model that22 F. N. deOliveira-Lopes, et al.

can properly reproduce linear modes, as mode coupling between diﬀerent wave solutions
is believed to play a role in turbulence dissipation in collisionless plasmas.. Furthermore,
the presently modiﬁed FIDEL solver is also capable of reproducing higher IBW modes,
as seen in Figure 5, which is a relevant point, also raised in (Podesta (2012)).
The presence of higher IBW modes is likely due to the presence of the Maxwellian
Laplacian in the Poisson equation. As it will be discussed in more detail in the next sec-
tion, the use of the Maxwellian Laplacian facilitates the computation of higher frequency
waves in the system, which is of importance in the study of ion frequency range energy
dissipation in solar wind turbulence.

Turbulent heating is thought to be one of the sources of ion heating in solar wind evo-
lution (Coleman (1968), Cranmer (2002), Oughton et al.(2011)). Magnetic reconnection,
Landau damping and transit time damping are thought to be the main processes involved
in the dissipation mechanism at kinetic scales (Karimabadi (2014), Hollweg (1978)). The
use of gyrokinetics to study solar wind turbulence has been put into question due to the
!
irestriction described in (Podesta (2012)). In the present model, we demonstrate
that the drift kinetic limit of our hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic formulation contains lower
hybrid wave, demonstrating an important step in the direction of simulating KAW-like
physics.
When looking at high frequency waves, our model’s dispersion relation takes the form

this point that at low values, a blow up of the frequency mode in the case without the
Maxwellian Laplacian happens due to the fact that reduced models such as driftkinetic
is valid to modes mainly perpendicular to the background magnetic ﬁeld. The eﬀect of
the Maxwellian Laplacian is seen on the numerical ( !n, green) and theoretical ( !t, red)
curves in Figure 6. Nevertheless, at high frequencies we observe that the eﬀect of the
Maxwellian Laplacian supersede the eﬀects of the electron polarization response. For
parallel propagating waves, the frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency on

7. Summary and Outlook
Energy dissipation in the solar wind has been regarded as one of the outstanding un-
solved problems in space plasma physics (Goldstein (2001)). While the full understanding
of the various mechanisms that take place on the solar corona and solar wind are far
from conclusive, it is expected that turbulence plays a major role (Viall & Borovsky
(2020)). The multi-scale nature of turbulence in space and astrophysics plasma imposes
a considerable barrier in computing those systems from the injection to the dissipation
range scale. In order to bridge this gap, reduced models are often used, and despite
their constraints, a good agreement has been shown (Howes et al.(2006), Jenko (2016)).
Despite that, in order to better understand energy dissipation at ion scale, one needs to
take into account constraints that violate the gyrokinetic conditions (Podesta (2012)).
With that in mind, we have derived a hybrid model that takes in consideration a24 F. N. deOliveira-Lopes, et al.
reduced description for electrons, and ions are considered in their fully kinetic nature, in
order to better compute ion scale range phenomena. We have seen how the reduced dy-
namics can be coherently coupled with the fully kinetic description through a coordinate
transformation on the ﬁeld equations frame of reference. Linearly, we have benchmarked
our system with two dispersion solvers, HYDROS and DSHARK. We have seen that
our system reproduces well not only ion acoustic waves and ion Bernstein waves, but
also higher frequency waves. A discussion about the relationship between ion Bernstein
waves and high frequency waves points to the direction that a reduced hybrid drift-
kinetic electrons and fully kinetic ions is already capable of depicting higher frequency
phenomena and therefore could be considered a step towards a reduced model capable
of describing energy dissipation in solar wind.
Nevertheless, the next steps are fundamental to cement the present results. The next
stage consists of the implementation of an electromagnetic dispersion relation solver.
That will allow us to study kinetic Alfven waves and their coupling with ion Bernstein
waves, and when cross analysed with Landau damping (Podesta (2012), Roberts et al.
(2020)) and ion Cyclotron damping (Chandran et al.(2010)) could shed some light in
the understanding of one of the many dissipation mechanisms taking place in solar wind
turbulence. Moreover, the nonlinear implementation of the system is already ongoing and
could further provide support to the validity of the model.

Appendix A.
In the present appendix, instead of going over the whole gyrokinetic derivation per-
formed for the present model, we are only going to point out the modiﬁcations we have
implemented on the derivation performed in the literature, namely (Littlejohn (1982,
1983), Tronko & Chandre (2018), Sugama (2000)).
The standard gyrokinetic coordinate transformation consists of a series of mathemat-
ical maneuvers that aim at reducing the functional dependency of the Lagrangian of
the system on the gyration angle. That functional dependency is expressed through the
elimination of the variable through perturbation theory.
The ﬁrst part of the transformation consists of the perturbation generated due to the
symmetry break imposed by a background magnetic ﬁeld. That symmetry transform the
fully kinetic Lagrangian

andA(x),x, and vstands for the magnetic potential, and the position and velocity
coordinates, respectively. Since the strength of the symmetry break imposed by the
background magnetic ﬁeld is of a higher ordering, our model does not diﬀer much fromHybrid Gyrokinetic Hamiltonian Field Theory 25
what is found on the literature at this point. This means that our Lagrangian remains
with the same format (deOliveira Lopes (2022)) after the guiding center transformation,

It is important to stress here that, in order to solve the cohomological equation A7,
one must ﬁrst apply the ﬂuctuating operation on the given coordinate, i.e ~Zgc=Zgc 

up to the ordering of our derivation. The second part of the coordinate transformation
consists on the addition of the symmetry break due to the presence of electromagnetic
perturbation. That transformation will give us our ﬁnal gyrocenter coordination trans-
formation.
The gyrokinetic transformation consists of a new ordering for the electric ﬁeld, that is

ﬁeld, we also consider an ordering for the magnetic potential, that meansrA1
A1"2
.
For the full gyrokinetic derivation, "?1, that condition can be relaxed, in the case
of a drift kinetic approximation, as it will be discussed in subsequent chapters. After a
velocity shift and a Lie transformation, a new generating function is required in order to
move towards the new coordinate system.
At this point we need to perform a few modiﬁcations to the standard derivations. More
details of this modiﬁcation can be found at (deOliveira Lopes (2022)). For the sake of
brevity, in this appendix we will content ourselves with laying down and understanding
the reason behind the modiﬁcations.
In constructing the new Hamiltonian, three Poisson brackets are required to ﬁnd theHybrid Gyrokinetic Hamiltonian Field Theory 27

strength of the ﬁelds acting on the gyrokinetic species, vis-à-vis the fully kinetic species,
we can consider the last term equals to zero. This small change propagates itself in the
derivation and a slightly modiﬁed ﬁnal Lagrangian ensues. It looks like

To summarize the modiﬁcations discussed in the present appendix, we would like
to point out that, whilst some of the old literature (Littlejohn (1982)) only performs
a guiding center approach, we follow more recent approaches and perform a further
transformation due to the electromagnetic perturbation ﬁelds, i.e. the gyrokinetic trans-
formation. Furthermore, similarly to Tronko & Chandre (2018), we make use of an
ordering associated to the curvature of the background magnetic ﬁeld, as opposed to
LittleJohn’s, which assumes an arbitrary , where the asymptotic derivation is performed
by taking!0. Our backgrounds magnetic ﬁeld is considered to be slab, which further
diﬀers our model from Tronko & Chandre (2018).
Speciﬁcally, our model deviates from the approach taken in previous works by further
applyingtheDarwinapproximation(Fang et al.(2009))inthecalculationofthemagnetic
ﬁeld’s contribution, and not only on the electric ﬁeld. In the Darwin approximation, the
time derivative of the ﬁelds on a Coulomb gauge Lagrangian is neglected. In the context
of the present work, that implies that there are no displacement current on the system.
Furthermore, our work diﬀers from Tronko & Chandre (2018), N. Tronko (2015), and
Tronko et al.(2019) on the use of a slab geometry approximation for the background28 F. N. deOliveira-Lopes, et al.
magnetic ﬁeld, which is more suitable for space and astrophysical plasma, as well as
minor modiﬁcations on the second coordinate transformation, as discussed above.
Moreover, our model further derive the strong version of the ﬁeld equations. Such a
derivation is more suitable for a grid based numerical implementation. While we draw
the inspiration to the ﬁeld theoretical approach from works such as Sugama (2000),
A. Brizard (2016), and Littlejohn (1983), our paths diverge at the computation of the
ﬁnal equations, where instead of adhering to the standard approach, we make use of a
coordinate transformation embedded in a variational derivative. More details on this
derivation are also found on the main body of the present manuscript.

 i!F +ivkF e
mik rvF0= 0; (C18)
the solutions for this system are integrated and we can then construct the linear ion
density perturbation ni. The solution for this equations is rather complex and its
derivation rather cumbersome, for detail on this, we refer the reader to (D. Told (2016),
Gaisbauer (2018)), and more speciﬁcally to (deOliveira Lopes (2022)) .
C.3. Poisson equation
In order to perform the linearization of the Poisson equation, we are going to work
with the following considerations:

in the guiding center position, also known as the gyrocenter density distribution.
The equations C18, C11, and C21 form a group of linear equations that must be
solved simultaneously. In order to ﬁnd the slutions of the system, we solve the perturbed
ion and electron equations, and by integrating them over velocity space, we then are able
to sove the ﬁeld equation C21. Such a solution gives us the wave dispersion relation and
it takes the form
D(k;!)= 0; (C22)
whereD(k;!)is in general the determinant of the matrix of the system. The solutions
of equation C22 provide us with the various waves we aim to study.
