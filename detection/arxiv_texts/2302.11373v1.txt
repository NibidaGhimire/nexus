Abstract  
  The giant exciton binding energy and the richness of degrees of freedom make 
monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide an unprecedented pl ayground  for exploring 
exciton physics in 2D systems. Thanks to the well energetically separated excitonic 
states, the response of the discrete excitonic states to the electric field could be precisely 
examined. Here we utilize the photocurrent spectroscopy to pro be excitonic states under 
a static in -plane electric field.  We demonstrate that the in -plane electric field leads to a 
significant orbital hybridization of Rydberg excitonic states with different angular 
momentum (especially orbital hybridization of 2 s and 2 p) and  consequently  optically 
actives 2p-state exciton . Besides, the electric -field controlled mixing of  the high lying 
exciton state and continuum band enhance s the oscillator strength of the discrete excited 
exciton state s. This electric field modu lation of the exciton ic states  in monolayer T MDs 
provides a paradigm of the manipulation of 2D excitons for potential applications of  
the electro -optical modulation  in 2D semiconductors . 
  
Hybridization primitively indicates  a mixing of atomic orbitals  of comparable energies  
for the description of chemical bonds in valence band theory. In 2D TMD s, band edges  
around ¬±K valleys  are primarily constructed  by d orbital s of transition -metal atom s 
with a small  component of  p orbital s of chalcogen  atom s due to atomic orbital  
hybridization [1-3]. This atomic  orbital  hybridization leads to a significant spin -orbit 
coupling in the conduction band edge [2]. Orbital hybridization of valley excitons exists 
not only among atomic orbitals but also in excitonic orbitals. For valley excitons  in 
monolayer TMD s, the complete wavefunction is described  with the direct product of 
electron /hole‚Äôs Bloch functions  featured with  parent atomic orbitals  and envelope 
function s featured with excitonic orbital s. The envelop functions  denote the relative 
motion s between electron and hole  and could be  described with  a Rydberg notation (n,l), 
where  n,l are the principal index ( n=1,2,3 ‚Ä¶) and orbital angular momentum quantum 
number ( l=0,1,2‚ãØ), respectively . The different Rydberg excitonic orbitals have the 
distinct optical properties , in an over -simplified manner , either bright or dark.  The 
bright excitons denote  the optically active excitons associated with the dipole allowed 
one-photon transition which dominates the linear optical properties. They are usually 
with a s-state exciton envelop function with zero orbital angular momentum  (l=0). 
However,  their excited stat es are not necessarily bright. For example, 2 p, 3p,‚Ä¶-state 
excitons  are naturally considered as the angular -momentum forbidden dark excit ons 
owing to the symmetry of the envelop function in the standard 2D exciton model [4-7]. 
In monolayer TMDs, the three -fold in -plane rotational symmetry  from the crystal lattice  
renders p-state excitons bright with the microscopic mechanism of the trigonal warping 
effect [8]. However, the p-state excitons are absent in the experimental linear optical 
spectra [9-11] and the calculations [8,12]  attribute the dark p-state excitons to the  
negligibl e oscillator strength in one -photon (dipole allowed) transition.  Recently, there 
are several theoretical proposals that disorders, Rashaba spin -orbit interaction or 
skyrmions could brighten p-state excitons [13,14].    
 
Here we demonstrate an electric -field controlled exciton ic orbital hybridization in 
hBN-encapsulat ed monolayer WSe 2 with the linear photocurrent spectroscopy . We 
observe that an  in-plane electric field  could  break the rotational symmetry of exciton 
envelop functions and  induce  a significant orbital hybridization of Rydberg excitons 
with different angular momentum  by mixing  their envelope functions and consequently  
brighten 2p-state exciton. Besides, the hybri dization between high lying excitons and 
continuum band enhances the oscillator strength of the discrete exciton states. Our 
experiments unambiguously demonstrate  that the energy , linewidth  and the oscillator 
strength of  the hybrid exciton states could be efficiently  modulated  with an in-plane 
electric field  owing to the unique character of 2D excitons .

The device is made of hBN-encapsulated monolayer WSe 2 with few -layer graphene as 
electric contacts . To avoid the photo gating effect from substrates, w e transfer the device  
onto transparent  fused quartz substrate s, as shown in Fig. 1a . The excitation beam is 
focused through a scanning objective on to a spot of ~1 micron on the device. Excitons 
are dissociated by t he local  electric field and a photocurrent is collected  via a lock -in 
technique (Fig. 1b) . Figure 1 c-d show  the representative  reflection and photocurrent 
maps under Vds=+5V  excited by  a 515nm  laser source  at T=10 K. The photocurrent 
arises at the region adjacent to the electric contact where the local electric field is 
expected to be maximum and strong enough to ionize excitons.  
The local carrier density is investigated by  the 2D color map of low-temperature  
photoluminescence ( PL) as a function of the source -drain bias from -50V to +50V . 
Figure 1 g shows that the PL map  of the ground state band edge exciton A-1s (which 
denotes the ground 1 s state of the band edge A exciton) and its corresponding trion s 
peak  around V ds=0V. The trions consisting of two electron -charged trions , namely 
intervalley and intravalley trions, signal the weak electron doping at zero bias. The PL 
peaks  redshift away from the zero -bias state, and fade with  the increasing source -drain 
bias in  both negative and positive direction s. These phenomena are significantly 
different from those in the electric gated PL experiments, where the increased carrier 
density transfers the oscillator strength from neutral exciton s to trions  and shifts the 
energy of the neutral exciton s and trion s in opposite directions , as described with the 
Fermi -polaron model [15,16] . This in-plane modulated PL experiment reveals the in -
plane electric field in force without noticeable doping effect. The suppressed PL 
emission at the increased bias implies the exciton dissociation under external electric 
field. The A -1s trion s fade at lower  electric field than that of A -1s neutral exciton and 
it is attributed to  the small binding energ ies of the trion s. The red -shift of both neutral 
excitons and trions  with the increased electric field could be regarded as the exciton ic 
DC Stark effect [17,18] . The s imilar electric field dependent PL behaviors  occur  in A-
2s exciton s (Fig. 1h)  with a higher sensitivity  to the in -plane electric field . The PL 
intensities of b oth neutral A-2s exciton s and the related trions drop to  an undetectable 
level under the bias beyond V ds=¬±10V, as a result of weaker exciton binding energ ies. 
Obviously , the PL spectroscopy of Rydberg excitons  is not capable  to trace the effect 
of in-plane electric field.

monolayer WSe 2 device s. (b) Photocurrent spectra  in log scale  under various in-plane electric field s 
(a zoom -in of the shifts of A1 s and the data under the  positive electric field are shown in 
Supplementary Note 2), which are extracted by excitonic DC stark effect of A -1s exciton , as showed 
in the upper green frame of (c). The energy shift of 1s exciton is proportional to the square of  electric 
field F and exciton in -plane polarizability  ùõº (~ -1/2ùõºùêπ2) with the fitting error bar . The in-plane 
polarizability of B exciton is  found to be  smaller than that of A exciton due to a large r exciton 
binding energy  resulted from the  larger effective mas s. Similar data from other devices are shown 
in Supplementary Note 3 . (d) The calculat ed electro -absorption of 1L WSe 2 in log scale from 0 to 
16V/ ùúáùëö , consistent with the experimental results in (b) . The dash lines denote the electro -
absorption spectra without 2 p state. 
 
We record the reflect ance contrast  and photocurrent spectr a of hBN-encapsulated 
monolayer WSe 2 by the excitation energy/wavelength with an intensity below 0.5ŒºW. 
Figure 2a depict s the reflectance contrast  and the photocurrent at V ds=+2V as a function 
of the excitation  energy . The band edge ground state exciton A-1s, the ground state spin -
off exciton  B-1s and the excitons around the ÔÅá point of the Brillouin zone C-1s exciton 
are clearly observed in both spectr a. A significant feature of the photocurrent spectra is 
the enhanced weight of the excited -state excitons including A -2s and B -2s. Although 
the occupation of these excited state is much less than the ground state s, the weaker 
binding energy leads to much higher ionization rate as the electron -hole tunneling is the 
dominating mechanism for exciton ionization in monolayer TMDs [19,20]  (see 
Supplementary Note 1). So, it is advantageous to study the excited exciton states with 
photocurrent spectroscopy.  
Figure 2a  shows that t he excited -state excitons A-2s and B -2s lie at 135, 159meV  
above th eir corresponding ground -state excitons A-1s and B -1s, respectively . It hints 
that the binding energy of B -exciton s is larger than that of A -exciton . In the 
photocurrent  spectrum , the A-2s exciton appears a t the  starting point  of a step-like 
feature and it may result from A-2s exciton state merging into the  onset of the interband 
continuum . Figure 2b  depicts  the photocurrent spectra  in log scale  as a function of  the 
applied source -drain bias from -1V to -60V that can be converted to  the electric field  
from -0.3V/ ùúáùëö to -18.6V/ ùúáùëö in the following paragraph . Both A-1s and B -1s exciton s 
energetically redshift with the increasing in -plane electric field  as a result of excitonic 
DC Stark effect and are well fitted in a quadratic relationship ~ ùõ•ùê∏=‚àí1
2ùõºùêπ2, where ùõº 
is the in-plane polarizability , that of A -1s is estimated to be around 2√ó10‚àí17‚Öáùëö2‚àï
ùëâ[17]. Therefore , we could extract  the magnitude of in -plane electric field,  shown in 
upper green axis of Figure 2c.  Besides, we  extract  the in-plane polarizability of B -1s 
exciton  of 0.75 Œ±A and it concludes  that the exciton binding energy of B -1s exciton is 
1.33 times that of A-1s exciton [21], which is consistent with the aforementioned  energy 
difference of A -2s/B-2s (Fig.2a)  and the previous re port about a larger effective mass [3] 
[22]. The photocurrent signal below A -1s exciton ( labeled as trion ) totally disappears  
when V ds is beyond  -10V (equivalent to F=-3.1 V/ ùúáùëö) since the trion s cannot survive  
under a large electric field, as demonstrated in the electric field dependent PL spectra  
(Fig. 1g) .  
We also observe two excited exciton states in the vicinity of  A-2s state, which could 
not be identified  directly . However, w e could exclude the possibility of A-2s trion state  
for the peak below A -2s for three reasons. Firstly, the aforementioned PL measurement 
shows that the source -drain voltage generates the in -plane electric field with negligible 
doping effect . Secondly, throughout the range of electric field where the PL of A -2s 
trion can be probed, the energy of A -2s trion has an unresolved shift  whereas  this peak  in the photocurrent  spectra  redshifts a few meV (Supplementary Note 4). Thirdly, the 
trion state of A -1s is negligible in the photocurrent experiments under a sizable in -plane 
electric field. So the trion state of much weaker oscillator strength  A-2s is unlikely to 
be prominent in photocurrent spectra.  Figure 2d shows the calculated electro -absorption 
spectra can most ly reproduce all features  including two unide ntified peaks  from  
experimental photocurrent spectra . According to the detailed analysis of calculat ed 
electro -absorption spectra , we assign them to 2ùëùùë• (ùë• denotes the direction of in -plane 
electric field) and 3ùë† states, which is elaborated  in the following  section . 
 
From the classical dipole model of neutral exciton, there exists a critical field by 
simply evaluating ùêπùëê=ùê∏ùëè
ùëí‚ãÖùëü  (ùê∏ùëè,‚Öá,ùëü  are exciton binding energy, electron charge  and 
Bohr radius , respectively ) for fully dissociation of Rydberg excitons in monolayer 
WSe 2 (Supplementary Note 5). The actual  in-plane electric field with the order of 
5V/ùúáùëö is perturbative to 1 s exciton while it  may be strong  enough to ionize  excitons 
with higher principal quantum number ( n‚â•3). Meanwhile , the electric field  of 5V/ùúáùëö 
is comp arable to the critical field for the excited exciton s (n=2) that include  
nondegenerate state s consist ing of 2s, 2p¬± excitons with valley degeneracy of two  in 
monolayer TMD s. Therefore, these excitonic states will be influenced enormously 
based on these assumptions .

exciton states preserve almost unchanged.  1s state keeps unchanged  until F=20V/ ùúáùëö. In region IIa  
marked in pink , 2ùëùùë•,2ùëùùë¶ & 2ùë† states distort evidently owing to the  orbital  hybridization with some 
neighbouring s tates. (b-e) The analysis of the  orbital  composition of hybrid excitons as a function

To accurately model the exciton energy under an external electric field, we 
numerically solve the Mott -Wannier exciton model to obtain the eigen -energ ies and 
eigen-wavefunction s of Rydberg exciton s, the effective Hamiltonian reads:  
{‚àí‚Ñè2
2ùúá‚àá2+ùë§(ùëü)+‚Öáùêπ‚Éë‚àôùëü‚Éë}Œ®=ùê∏Œ® 
Where the ùë§(ùëü)=‚àíùëí2
8ùúÄ0ùëü0[ùêª0(ùúÖùëü
ùëü0)‚àíùëå0(ùúÖùëü
ùëü0)] is the popular Rytova -Keldysh potential 
describing the screening Coulomb attraction in 2D case , ùúá , ‚Öáùêπ‚Éë‚àôùëü‚Éë  represent exciton 
effective mass and the external electric field term , respectively . The absorption spectra 
are then calculated as ùúîùêºùëö(ùúí(ùúî)). (See more details in Supplementary Note 6) 
We trace the two unidentified peaks under the different in -plane electric field s 
mentioned in the last section. By calculating the projection of these corresponding 
eigenfunctions |ùúô‚ü© on the excitonic states ( to distinguish excitonic states  whether  they 
are under an in -plane  electric field , we define  the original  excitonic states  without 
electric field  by the superscript ‚Äò0‚Äô, such as  |1ùë†0‚ü©,|2ùëùx0‚ü©,|2ùë†0‚ü©‚Ä¶), we find  that the two 
peaks mainly consist of the 2ùëùùë•  and 3 s states, respectively , and then we can safely 
assign them to 2ùëùùë• and 3ùë† excitonic states (more details in S upplementary Note 7).   
Fig.3a shows the real space distribution s of 1 s, 2ùëùùë• , 2ùëùùë¶ , 2s-states  at various  
representative electric field s, and Fig.3b-e summarize the dominated orbital 
composit ions of these  states . According to the electric field effect on excitons , we 
describe the scenario exclusively  in three regions  I, II, III for low, medium , and high 
electric field , respectively . In the case of low electric field, ‚Öáùêπ‚Éë‚àôùëü‚Éë‚â™ùë§(ùëü), the external 
field is  perturbative on the excitonic states so that these states almost preserve as 
original ones.  The spatial distribution s of these four  envelope wavefunction s almost 
keep unchanged , as demonstrated in  region I  (the blue frame  of Fig. 3a ) and the original 
states keep  a major component  (more than 90%)  in the blue region I of Fig 3b-e. In the 
region  II of medium electric field, we can further divide it into region  IIa ‚Öáùêπ‚Éë‚àôùëü‚Éë<ùë§(ùëü) 
and region IIb ‚Öáùêπ‚Éë‚àôùëü‚Éë>ùë§(ùëü). In region IIa,  the eigenstates are still discrete excitonic 
states  and t he spa tial distributions of exciton wavefunctions show a finite  distort ion 
from the original ones  (the pink frame of Fig. 3a) . This is because that the excitonic 
states  start to hybridize with some  adjacent ones to non-negligible  extent , form ing 
hybrid excitons . 2s/2ùëùùë•  state still keeps dominant component in despite of a large 
reduction  in the hybrid exciton  shown as the pink region II a of Fig. 3b-e. 2ùëùùë¶ state is 
relatively immune to the orthogonal electric field ( ùë•-direction).  Here, the dark 2ùëùùë• state 
transits from dark to bright state and emerges in the linear photocurrent  spectrum  as it 
effectively  hybridizes with the bright 2 s state (Fig.3c) . The bright 2 s state hybridizes 
with the dark 2ùëùùë• state at  the increase of electric field  (Fig. 3e).  Note  that the dark 2ùëùùë¶ 
state does not hybridize with the 2s state, but mixes with the dark 3ùëëùë• state (Fig.3d) . 
Therefore , it keeps dark and undetectable.  In region II b, ‚Öáùêπ‚Éë‚àôùëü‚Éë>ùë§(ùëü), the eigenstates 
carry  similar features as the continuous function s from  2D Airy equation (‚àí‚Ñè2
2ùúá‚àá2+‚Öáùêπ‚Éë‚àôùëü‚Éë)Œ®=ùê∏Œ® ). Namely  the hybrid excitons  mix with the continuous  
states , leading to effective  inhomogeneous broadening  so that  they become a broad 
rather than  discrete distribution in energy  spectrum , denoted as error bars in Fig. 3b-e. 
Here , we confirm the linewidths of 2 s or 2ùëùùë• become broad er from F=6V /ùúáùëö in the 
photocurrent experiment (Fig. 2b). Although the 2s or 2ùëùùë• component in the hybrid 
excitons decrease  but still give the biggest contribution.  In the  region III,  ‚Öáùêπ‚Éë‚àôùëü‚Éë‚â´ùë§(ùëü), 
the screening Coulomb attraction can be considered as a perturbative term of the two-
dimensional Airy equation  where t he eigenstates are mostly continuous . We do not 
reach so large electric field of the region III  in our experiments .  
 
In summary , three -fold in -plane rotational symmetry could theoretically mix the s-p 
excitonic state s, but the mixing strength is expected to be too small to brighten 2 p 
state[8,12 ]. In our case, the applied in -plane electric field is orders of magnitude smaller 
than the crystal field, but large enough to break the in -plane rotational symmetry of n=2 
exciton envelope function. Consequently, the angular momentum is not well define d 
and the wavefunctions of 2 s and 2 p states are hybridized if the electric field is 
comparable to the exciton critical field.  The dipole -forbidden (dark) A-2ùëùùë• exciton ic 
state could be brightened by an in-plane electric field in the linear spectra  due to the 
orbital hybridization with 2s state. It is further confirmed by the simulated absorption 
spectrum calibrated with the experimental data, as shown in Figure 2d .  
The 3s state is predicted to undergo an orbital hybridization with the dark 3ùëùùë• & 3ùëëùë¶ 
states under a small electric field . However, we could  not observe 3s state under the 
electric field ranging from zero  until F=-3.1V /ùúáùëö  presumably owing to its weak 
oscillat or strength and the signal/noise ratio  of the experiment setup . The 3 s state clearly  
emerges under the electric field from -6.2V /ùúáùëö  to -15.5 V/ùúáùëö  in the photocurrent 
spectra  (Fig.2b). We attribute the enhancement of  3s state to the hybridization  with the 
continuous states . (Supplementary Note 8). 
The increase  of exciton orbital hybridization  is followed by the energy shifts of the 
hybrid excitons.  We record the energ y values  of hybrid excitons  A-1ùë†, 2ùë†, 2ùëùùë•, 3s and 
B-1ùë† , 2ùë†  from both photocurrent experiment s (dots) and the numerical calculation  
(solid line s, ùúá=0.23ùëöùëí,ùúÖ=4.5,ùëü0=4.62ùëõùëö  Supplementary Note 5 ) shown in 
Figure 4 a. They are consistent  very well. The 1ùë† exciton  experiences a  small quadratic 
redshift with the electric field  owing to  the negligible orbital hybridization of 2ùëùùë• state  
at F=-18.6V /ùúáùëö (Fig.2c) . In contrast, the 2ùëùùë• red-shifts while 2ùë† and 3 s blue-shift by 
tens of meV when in -plane electric field goes to 16V/ ùúáùëö. The 2ùëùùë• exciton effectively 
hybridiz es with 2 s state while little with  3ùëëùë¶ state. Although it is difficult to  resolve  A-
3s exciton under small electric fields in our experiment , its energy  shift under electric 
fields F=-6.2~ -15.5 V /ùúáùëö is well  consistent with the numerical values.  In particular,  
the energies of A -2s and 3 s excitons  under a fairly strong  in-plane electric field  could 
exceed that of the continuous band (1.90eV), denoted as gray dashed line in Fig.4a.  
This does not mean the exciton binding energy is positive . As the hybrid  exciton gains 
extra  electric potential energy from the external electric field , the exciton binding energy is still negative , which secures these exciton states in the photocurrent spectrum . 
(see Supplementary Note 9)

absorption, denoted as dots and solid lines respectively.   
 
In conclusion, the in-plane electric field breaks the in -plane rotational symmetry of 
the exciton envelope function and mixes exciton  states with different  excitonic  orbitals, 
resulting in the formation of new hybrid excitons . We demonstrate  that the energy , 
linewidth  and oscillator strength of the  hybrid exciton s can be electrically tuned by the 
in-plane electric field  with the magnitude of 1-16V/ùúáùëö. The 2s and 2 ùëùùë• exciton s can 
hybridize each other efficiently and this hybridization optically actives  the dark 2 ùëùùë• 
exciton in the one-photon photocurrent spectrum.  Besides, the oscillator strength of 3 s 
exciton is promoted due its hybridization with continuum band. Also , we observe that 
the in-plane polarizability of B -1s exciton is smaller than that of A -1s and the energy 
separation between 2 s and 1 s of B exciton is larger than that of A exciton , both implying 
the higher binding energy of B exciton.  Besides, the hybrid excitons under an in-plane 
electric field inherit  the properties of all base orbitals, and consequently  they may be 
bright in both one -photon and two -photon optical transitions . Our results demonstrate  
the exceptional electric tunability of 2D excitons,  providing  a potential application of  
electro -optical modulations with 2D TMDs.
