The efficiency of a Bell-state measurement on photon pairs is bound to 50 % due to the number
of Bell states that can be distinguished using linear optics. Here we present the implementation
of a protocol that allows us to distinguish all four Bell states by the use of a single-ion quantum
memory and heralded absorption as state-selective measurement. The protocol is implemented in
two steps. First we demonstrate the state-preserving mapping of a photonic qubit onto the quantum
memory, verified by the preservation of entanglement in the process. Then we demonstrate the full
Bell state projection between a memory qubit and an incoming photonic qubit, by applying it for
atom-to-photon quantum state teleportation.
Photonic Bell state projection is a fundamental tool in
quantum networks based on single photons. It enables,
for example, the extension of a quantum link with quan-
tum repeater operations [1] and the transmission of quan-
tum information via quantum teleportation [2]. A generic
application, that also provides the context to this arti-
cle, is the generation of remote memory entanglement via
photonic Bell-state projection at a central station [3–5].
Bell state discrimination on photon pairs is fundamen-
tally limited to 50 % [6, 7] when only linear optical ele-
ments are used. Overcoming this limitation becomes pos-
sible using hyper-entanglement [8–11], nonlinear optical
elements [12], or auxiliary photons [13]. An alternative
implementation for entangling remote memories, that al-
lows one to distinguish between all four Bell states, was
demonstrated in [14] with trapped Rb atoms. This ap-
proach does not use a central station but is mediated by
successive interaction of two photons with both memory
qubits. The gain in fundamental efficiency is, however,
partially offset by the condition that both photons need
to travel the full distance. Another possibility is the use
of memories at the central station, to which the photonic
qubits are transferred before a projective measurement.
Using quantum gates on single ions in the same trap, de-
terministic projection onto all four two-atom Bell states
has been demonstrated [15, 16]. Combining this with
photon-to-atom state mapping [17] would allow full Bell
state projection on two incoming photons.
In this manuscript we present a related protocol that
allows us to distinguish all Bell states, using only a single
memory qubit in a40Ca+ion. In this approach, a first
incoming photon is mapped onto the memory qubit. A
full Bell state projection is then performed between the
memory qubit and the second incoming photon by her-
alded absorption [18], using projection of the herald and
of the memory qubit as Bell state measurement.
We demonstrate the elements of the protocol in two
separate steps: the first is the faithful mapping of an in-
coming single photon onto the memory qubit. For this we
apply the heralded absorption interface that was intro-duced in [17] and verified with laser photons. We use the
interface to store in the single ion a single photon, her-
alded by and entangled with its partner from an SPDC
photon pair source [19]. We characterize the mapping
by the fidelity with which the original photon-photon
entanglement is preserved in the resulting atom-photon
state. The second step is the projection of a 2-qubit
state between the memory and an incoming photon onto
the four Bell states. We demonstrate and verify this full
Bell measurement, which again is facilitated by heralded
absorption, by its direct application for quantum state
teleportation from the prepared memory qubit onto the
partner photon of the absorbed one. The observation of
the expected, Bell-state-specific, unitary rotation bench-
marks the fidelity of the teleportation and hence the Bell
measurement. While the overall efficiency in our proof-
of-principle experiment is severely limited, application of
the protocol in combination with resonator-based inter-
faces [20, 21] holds the perspective of overcoming the
limitations of linear optical projections.
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Figure 1 shows the experimental setup and the relevant
energy levels and transitions of40Ca+. A single40Ca+
ion is trapped in a linear Paul trap with single-photon
optical access by two in-vacuum high-numerical-aperture
laser objectives (HALOs, NA = 0 .4). One of the objec-
tives is used to focus 854 nm photons onto the ion, in or-
der to excite it from its initial state in the D 5/2manifold
to the P 3/2manifold. The second HALO is used to collect
the emitted (Raman-scattered) 393 nm photons which
are subsequently polarisation-projected with a Wollas-
ton prism (PBS) and detected with free-space coupled
avalanche photo diodes (APDs) in both outputs. This
HALO is also used to couple the non-absorbed 854 nm
photons into a 16 m long single-mode fiber with attached
retroreflector. The fiber is used to create 160 ns delay and
an inversion of the direction relative to the quantizationarXiv:2301.06091v4  [quant-ph]  20 Nov 20232

FIG. 1. Schematic of the experiment. The photon-pair
source S generates polarization-entangled photon pairs. Pho-
tons in output A are directed to the atomic setup, where a
single trapped40Ca+ion acts as a quantum memory. The
photons pass a set of waveplates to compensate for polar-
ization rotations in the fiber connecting the photons to the
atomic setup. The partner photons in output B are sent
to a tomography setup for analyzing their polarization state.

axis, which is defined by a magnetic field of 2 .855 G.
The photon pair source, labelled S, produces
frequency-stable, narrow-band, polarization-entangled
photon pairs at 854 nm in a cavity enhanced spontaneous-
parametric-down-conversion process (SPDC) with inter-
ferometric configuration. More detailed information is
provided in [19]. The photon in output A has a linewidth
of 12.29 MHz and is tuned to be resonant with the D 5/2-
P3/2transition of the40Ca+ion (22 MHz-linewidth).
Output B is detuned by 480 MHz. The result of a to-
mographic measurement [22] on the photon-pair state ρ
in the fiber-coupled outputs A and B is shown in fig-
ure 2. A fidelity of ⟨Ψ−|ρ|Ψ−⟩= 91.64(2) % (97 .16(2) %
with background correction) with the antisymmetric Bell
state, and a purity of tr( ρ2) = 84 .97(4) % (95 .21(3) %
with background correction) are measured at our op-
erating conditions (15 mW of pump light at 427 nm).
Background originates from lost-partner events and de-
tector dark counts; see [19] for more information. A fiber-
coupled pair rate of 2 .69×105s−1in the output fibers A
and B is inferred from the correlation measurements.
STEP 1: QUBIT MAPPING
We now describe the mapping of a single-photon qubit
state to a qubit state in a single trapped ion and charac-
terize it by its process fidelity, as well as by quantum state

and|R⟩/|L⟩(|H⟩/|V⟩) for the single-photon states in the
circular (linear) polarization modes. The protocol starts
by preparing a symmetric coherent superposition in D 5/2,
|φ⟩D=1√

, then the photon-
pair generation is switched on with an acousto-optic mod-
ulator that controls the SPDC pump laser. Photons from
arm A are focused onto to the ion, co-propagating with
the direction of the magnetic field. The absorption of an
854 nm (red) photon in the polarization qubit state
|φ⟩A=a|R⟩A+b|L⟩A, (1)
with amplitudes aandb, releases with high probabil-
ity (93 .5 %) a 393 nm (blue) Raman photon in the state
|φ⟩393. The blue photon is detected and polarization-
analysed with 1.64 % probability. If the red photon is
not absorbed in the first passage, it is collected and sent
back to the ion with a time delay of 160 ns, now counter-
propagating to the magnetic field. Absorption in the first
and second passage are distinguished by the delay of the
detected 393 nm photon with respect to the partner pho-
ton in arm B.
The Raman scattering process is described by the op-
erators [23]

to the |H⟩393and|V⟩393projection results of the 393 nm
photon, which also heralds the absorption and thereby
allows us to filter out successful mapping processes. The
fidelity of the mapping, expressed in terms of process
fidelity [24] was determined to be χ11= 96 .2 % by an
independent measurement using single photons; see the
Supplement for more information. Magnetic field fluctu-
ations are the main limitation to the fidelity. To counter-
act phase fluctuations in the atomic qubit due to mag-
netic stray fields, a spin-echo sequence synchronised with
the Larmor precession is applied in the following mea-
surements (see Methods).
Another means of characterizing the photon-to-atom
state mapping is provided by measuring the transfer of
polarization entanglement from the two-photon state to
the atom-photon state. Using all heralded absorption
events, full quantum state tomography is performed on
the two-qubit state of atom in S 1/2and 393-nm photon,
similar to [25]. It reveals the reconstructed density matri-
ces displayed in figure 3. Details on the data and the re-
construction procedure are available in the Supplement.
The overlap fidelities and purities of the reconstructed
states with the ideal, maximally entangled states ( |Ψ−⟩
in the 1stpassage and |Φ−⟩in the 2ndpassage) are sum-
marized in table I. The values in brackets are corrected
for background and binning. The most relevant back-
ground contribution is caused by accidental coincidences,
inherent to an SPDC pair source. The binning correction
is described in the Methods section. The two figures of
merit serve different purposes: a practical system, set
to operate at a fixed pair rate, would most honestly be
characterized by the uncorrected fidelities that quantify,
for example, the usable entanglement. In contrast, char-
acterization of the implementation and operation of the
protocol would exclude such background, as well as bin-
ning and detector noise, such that the corrected fidelities

STEP 2: BELL-STATE PROJECTION
We now describe how a full Bell state measurement on
an atom-photon state is facilitated by heralded absorp-
tion. We experimentally demonstrate and characterize
the protocol by applying it for quantum state teleporta-
tion from an atom to a photon. Teleportation starts with
a qubit encoded in the D 5/2manifold,
|φ⟩D=α|−5/2⟩D+β|+5/2⟩D(7)
and the entangled two-photon state |Ψ−⟩A,B. The Bell
states between the 854 nm photon in arm A and the atom
in D 5/2are defined by
|Φ±⟩A,D=1√
2(|R⟩A|−5/2⟩D± |L⟩A|+5/2⟩D)
|Ψ±⟩A,D=1√
2(|R⟩A|+5/2⟩D± |L⟩A|−5/2⟩D)(8)4
The joint state of all three qubits in the standard tele-
portation notation [26] is then

The Bell state projection on the atom and the photon in
arm A is performed by the heralded absorption process,
subsequent projection of the 393 nm Raman photon (the
herald) onto the linear polarizations of eq. (4), and pro-
jection of the S 1/2qubit state onto the superpositions of
the Zeeman sub-levels

The operation as a Bell state measurement is understood
by describing the eight possible measurement outcomes

– with the help of the Raman process operators for the
first and second passage (eq. (2), eq. (3))

One sees that we project onto the |Φ±⟩A,Dstates in the
first passage and onto the |Ψ±⟩A,Dstates in the second
passage, hence all four Bell states are distinguished. The
result of the projection measurement is the classical 2-
bit information needed to complete the quantum state
teleportation onto photon B.TABLE II. Process fidelities of atom-to-photon teleportation

To demonstrate the full Bell-state measurement,
we perform teleportation of various input qubit
states: we prepare the atomic basis states |−5/2⟩D
and |+5/2⟩D, as well as various superpositions/parenleftbig

2. For variation of the
phase ϕ, we take advantage of the Larmor precession in
the atom; the phase is well defined in every absorption
event through the time between preparation of the atom
and detection of the 393 nm herald [18]. Teleportation
events are binned according to ϕfor evaluation. Using all
successful runs of the teleportation protocol (detection of
herald and photon B), state tomography on the 854 nm
target photon B is applied. It consists in measuring
the photon in the H/V (horizontal/vertical), D/A
(diagonal/anti-diagonal), and R/L (right/left circular)
polarization bases, successively, for each atomic input
state. The measurements are then used to reconstruct
the quantum process matrix [24] in the Pauli basis
σ0, σx, σy, σzwith a maximum likelihood algorithm. The
result of the reconstruction is shown in figure 4. Condi-
tioned on the eight possible outcomes of eqs. (10)-(13),
we see that either a σx(figure 4(a)), a σy(figure 4(b)),
no rotation (figure 4(c)) or σz(figure 4(d)) must be
applied to the target photon to reveal the prepared input
state. The corresponding entries in the process matrix
are referred to as process fidelities and listed in table II.
The mean process fidelity is 76(9) % (81(5) % with
background and binning correction). Like before, the
most relevant contribution to the background is caused
by accidental coincidences of the SPDC source. The
Bell state projection is therefore benchmarked by the
background-corrected value, but we would have to take
the uncorrected value when quantifying the teleportation
fidelity with the used experimental apparatus.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The statistics of Fig. 4 and Table II are based on
511 670 886 executions of the teleportation protocol (i.e.,
coincident registration of the absorption herald and the
partner photon) in 49.75 h hours of exposure.
Given the free-space coupling between ion and in- and
outgoing photons, the absorption probability for an in-
coming photon is 1 .04×10−3in the first passage, and
1.32×10−4in the second passage. The measured de-5

tection efficiency for the absorption herald at 393 nm is
1.64 %. This leads to a success probability for an individ-
ual heralded absorption event of 1 .71×10−5in the first
passage, and 2 .16×10−6in the second passage (see the
Supplement for more details). Much higher rates may be
obtained when absorption and release of the herald are
enhanced by optical resonators [20, 21]. Nevertheless, the
fidelity of the protocol is independent of the success prob-
ability, because the herald allows us to filter out success-
ful events. Factors that limit the fidelity are polarization
impurities, atomic decoherence due to magnetic noise,
inherent background from the SPDC process, and the
binning of the detected photon arrival times. The data
of Fig. 4 and the fidelity numbers in the middle column of
Table II are corrected for background and binning. We
characterized the impact of magnetic field fluctuations
by evaluating data only from the first 50 µs of the total
350µs exposure window in the state mapping procedure.
The fidelity for the first passage, ⟨Ψ−|ρ|Ψ−⟩(see ta-
ble I), increases from 78 .0(9) % to 84(2) % (82 .4(10) % to
89(2) %, with corrections). For the second passage, how-
ever, using 50 µs exposure time leads to too large statis-
tical uncertainties, such that we used 350 µs throughout.
The remaining infidelity, with respect to what one ex-
pects from the initial two-photon state (Fig. 2), originates
predominantly from accumulated polarization impurities
in the optical paths and phase drifts of the SPDC source
on long time scales.
In conclusion, we presented a proof-of-concept exper-iment that points a way to a full four-state Bell mea-
surement on two incoming photons, by employing a sin-
gle quantum memory. We demonstrated and character-
ized two parts of the overall protocol separately. In the
first step, a single photon is mapped onto a single-atom
memory qubit; the procedure is verified by the faithful
transfer of two-photon entanglement to memory-photon
entanglement. In the the second step, the full Bell-state
measurement on the 2-qubit state between memory and
another photon is demonstrated. It is implemented by
using heralded absorption and discriminating the four
output states between herald and final atomic qubit. We
verified this second step by applying it in quantum state
teleportation from the memory qubit onto the partner
photon of the absorbed one, using the SPDC photon pair
source as resource of entanglement. The presented exper-
iments confirm that, by the use of heralded operations,
high-fidelity quantum operations may be realized despite
possibly low success probabilities [17, 25, 27].
While the overall protocol offers a means to overcome
the fundamental efficiency limitation of 50 % of a 2-
photon Bell state measurement with linear optics, the
real efficiency of the presented implementation is severely
limited by other factors. As already mentioned, this sit-
uation changes when using optical resonators. The ap-
proach of [21], using separate resonators for the incoming-
and heralding photon, reaches already a single-photon
heralding efficiency of 11(1) %, and is importantly not
limited by fundamental factors as well as the described
protocol. We note two further features of our protocol.
Firstly, the two photons need not interfere directly with
each other; as a consequence they may be distinguishable
in terms of temporal or spectral properties and need not
be Fourier-limited. Secondly, the approach works with
consecutively arriving photons, i.e., the required arrival
time distribution is relaxed by the protocol; importantly,
it may be used as an asynchronous Bell measurement in
a quantum repeater segment [28].
METHODS
Atomic manipulations
A set of 397 nm and 866 nm lasers is used for Doppler
cooling on the S 1/2-P1/2transition, and for fluorescence
detection. Coherent manipulations on the D 5/2and S 1/2
Zeeman sub-levels of the ion are performed with a radio-
frequency (RF) magnetic field antenna and a narrow-
band 729 nm laser.
The ion is first initialized in the pure state |−1/2⟩Sby
Doppler cooling and frequency-selective optical pumping.
A resonant π/2 RF pulse creates a coherent superposi-
tion of the S 1/2Zeeman sub-levels. To generate coherent
superposition of the D 5/2Zeeman states, two 729 nm π-
pulses transfer the populations coherently from |−1/2⟩S6
to|−5/2⟩Dand from |+1/2⟩Sto|+5/2⟩D. Additional de-
tails are provided in [17, 18].
Ion-photon quantum state reconstruction
We perform a tomographic complete set of measure-
ments to reconstruct the two-qubit ion-photon quan-
tum state after heralded absorption, ρ. The chosen ob-
servables are the 16 tensor products {ˆσi⊗ˆσj|i, j=
0, . . . , 3}of identity and Pauli spin operators, {ˆσ0,...,3}=
{ˆ1,ˆσx,ˆσy,ˆσz}. Their expectation values

allow for direct linear reconstruction of ρaccording to

puts of a polarizing beam splitter. For atomic projection
onto the |±1/2⟩Sbasis, i.e. for ⟨ˆσz⟩, we perform electron
shelving and fluorescence detection. An additional π/2
RF pulse before electron shelving is used to project onto
the superposition basis. Atomic superpositions carry a
Larmor precession phase defined by the time instant at
which the heralded absorption happened. We therefore
plot the projection result after the π/2pulse as a function
of this Larmor phase and extract ⟨ˆσx⟩and⟨ˆσy⟩from a
fit to a sinusoidal function

Larmor precession and spin echo
Due to the Zeeman splitting in the static magnetic
field, the atomic superposition states undergo Larmor
precession. At our magnetic field strength, the D 5/2su-
perposition precesses with 24 MHz, while the S 1/2qubit
oscillates at 8 MHz. We take advantage of the different
Larmor precession frequencies and the variable waiting
time until heralded absorption occurs, to provide atomic
superposition states with different phases in each run.
Our phase reference is an RF oscillator set to the Lar-
mor frequency of the ground-state qubit. The phase of
each event is calculated a posteriori from the arrival time
of the absorption herald.
Fluctuations in the ambient magnetic field change the
Larmor frequencies and give rise to phase errors. While
slow variations (50 Hz and harmonics) are suppressed us-
ing a feed-forward stabilization via compensation coils,
faster noise leads to decoherence of the atomic qubits.
A spin-echo [29] technique compensates these errors par-
tially: by applying a π-pulse on the ground-state qubit
and a subsequent waiting time τS= 3×τDbefore pro-
jecting the atomic state, the phase error accumulated in
D5/2during the time τDbetween preparation and ab-
sorption is corrected. The factor 3 in the waiting time is
determined by the ratio between the Larmor frequencies
of the D 5/2and the S 1/2Zeeman qubits.
Instead of triggering the spin-echo pulses directly by
the herald, we check every 500 ns whether absorption
has occured. By choosing the loop time, and thereby
alsoτDandτS, to be an integer multiple of the difference
of the two Larmor frequencies, we avoid fractional phase
accumulation.

SINGLE-PHOTON TO ATOM QUANTUM STATE
MAPPING
By pumping the SPDC resonator from only one side,
we generate orthogonally polarized photon pairs, that are
split on the polarizing beam splitter. We use the photon
in arm A as the herald for a single photon in arm B, that
is sent to the ion. The polarization of photon B is rotated
to one of the 6 input polarizations |i⟩ ∈ {| H⟩,|D⟩,|V⟩,
|A⟩,|R⟩,|L⟩}. We reconstruct the process matrix [1] by
quantum state tomography on the final atomic state ρf,i
for each input polarization. We correct the background
for lost-partner events and detector dark counts.

FIG. 1: Absolute values of the reconstructed process
matrix with the identity part of 96 .2 % and mean
overlap fidelity of 96 .7(8) %.
Figure 1 shows the absolute values of the process ma-
trixχwith the identity part of χ11= 96.2 % identified as
the process fidelity. From this value, we infer the mean
overlap fidelity ⟨F⟩= (2 χ11+ 1)/3 = 96 .6 % (93 .3 %
without background correction), which agrees with the
mean of measured overlap fidelities of 1 /6/summationtext
i⟨i|ρf,i|i⟩=
96.7(8) % (93(3) % without background correction). The
major limitation is the coherence time of the ion due
to magnetic field fluctuations during the exposure time
(56µs in Fig. 1). We repeated the protocol 1 .13×108
times for the measurement, which led to a total exposure
time of 1 h45 min. In this time, we generated 9 .3×108
heralded fibre-coupled 854 nm photons, and we recorded
7810 detected (background corrected) coincidences be-
tween the 854 nm herald and the emitted 393 nm photon.
We extract the state mapping probability for a fiber cou-
pled photon to be η= 8.4×10−6. Efficiencies for the
entanglement transfer and the teleportation differ from
these values and are discussed in the following sections.POLARISATION CONTROL
For setting the polarisation of photon B, we adjust the
measurement basis at the detectors: we send laser light
backwards through our setup and detect it with a po-
larimeter via a flip mirror. The rotation matrix of this
flip mirror is compensated by three waveplates (quarter-
wave, half-wave, quarter-wave). The projection setup
generates 37 different input polarizations, equally dis-
tributed over the Poincare sphere. From the measured
polarizations we then calculate the rotation matrix MB.
The polarisation between the source and the trap is,
in contrast, compensated behind the source: we insert a
99:1 fiber beam splitter in the fiber connecting source and
trap. Between the source and the beam splitter we install
a fiber polarisation controller (PolaRITE III PCD-M02-
854), and between beam splitter and trap a 3-paddle po-
larisation controller. The 1 % output of the beam splitter
is connected to a reference polarimeter. For calibration,
we send a reference laser beam from the back-reflection
direction. Its polarization is first adjusted to |R⟩at the
position of the ion, indicated by maximal suppression
of the corresponding orthogonal transition. With an op-
tional quarter-wave plate the reference polarization is ro-
tated to |H⟩. The next step is to compensate the polari-
sation to the reference polarimeter with the fiber paddles.
In the next step we compensate the polarisation to the
source, which is measured with an additional polarime-
ter in front of the source. The last step is to send the
light from the source direction and compensate the po-
larisation of the back-reflection, measured again with the
reference polarimeter.

QUANTUM STATE TELEPORTATION: DATA
AND EVALUATION
For the teleportation measurement, we calculate his-
tograms of the correlated events of Bell-state measure-
ments and partner-photon polarization. Figure 4 con-
tains the teleportation measurement data. The columns
correspond to the Bell-state-measurement outcome. The
first three rows show the probabilities for the superpo-
sition input to detect |H⟩B,|D⟩B, and |R⟩Bin depen-
dence of the superposition phase. The probabilities to
detect |V⟩B,|A⟩B, and |L⟩Bare derived by calculating
1−P(ϕ)(H/D/L ). The last two rows contain the probabil-
ities when starting with the energy eigenstates |±5/2⟩D.
All probabilities are fed into a maximum likelihood al-
gorithm to reconstruct the process matrix.
QUANTUM STATE TELEPORTATION: RATES
AND EFFICIENCIES
In total we performed Nrun= 511 670 886 measure-
ment runs with τexp= 350 µs exposure time per run and
recorded Nc,first= 89 838 coincident events between the
393 nm heralds and the 854 nm photons for the first pas-
sage and Nc,second = 11 322 for the second passage. The
success probabilities per exposure time are then
ηsuccess,run,first =Nc,first
Nrun= 1.76×10−4(1)
ηsuccess,run,second =Nc,second
Nrun= 2.21×10−5(2)
The total exposure time Ttot,exposure wasNrun·τexp=
1.79×105s = 49 .75 h. With our pair rate per pump power
of 5.17×104(s mW)−1and 15 mW pump power we get
the total number of generated pairs Npairs = 1.388 803 ×
1011. The success probabilities per pair are then
ηsuccess,pair,first =Nc,first
Npair= 6.47×10−7(3)
ηsuccess,pair,second =Nc,second
Npair= 8.15×10−8(4)
These values are composed of several contributions.
The detection efficiency of the 854 nm photons in arm B
including APD quantum efficiency, spectral filters, fibers
and all other optical components is η854,B= 12 .6 %.
The total coupling efficiency from the photon-pair source
to the ion setup (in front of the vacuum chamber) is
η854,A= 30 %. For detecting the 393-nm absorption
herald, the HALO covers 4 % solid angle; in combina-
tion with the emission pattern of σ-transition it collects
6 % of the emitted 393 nm photons. The 393 nm pho-
ton detection efficiency after the HALO is 37 .5 %. The
total 393 nm detection efficiency is then η393= 1.64 %.
We include coincidences between absorption herald andarm B photon within a gate of ±84 ns, corresponding to
ηgate= 99.9 % of the 854 nm photon wave packet. The
remaining part is the absorption efficiency ηabsper in-
coming photon. We calculate these probabilities as
ηabs,first =ηsuccess,pair,first
η854,Aη854,Bη393ηgate= 1.04×10−3(5)
ηabs,second =ηsuccess,pair,second
η854,Aη854,Bη393ηgate= 1.32×10−4(6)
The absorption probability per photon is in good agree-
ment with earlier measured values [2–4].
QUANTUM STATE TELEPORTATOIN: ERROR
BUDGET & IMPROVEMENTS
To investigate the influence of the magnetic field fluctu-
ation, we vary the offset of the detection window (50 µs),
taking only later events into account. The data is shown
in Fig. 5. We see a linear decrease in fidelity. Therefore
we claim that the fidelity is mainly limited by decoher-
ence due to magnetic field fluctuations.
One improvement, especially for the entanglement
transfer, is to avoid the influence of the Larmor phase.
To describe the qubit without this phase we need to deal
with the different energy spacings of the qubits. This
can be done by simultaneously changing the frequency of
the reference oscillator to the Larmor frequency of the D-
state qubit, while the electron is in the D-state. Once the
herald of absorption is detected, the frequency is changed
back to the Larmor frequency of the ground-state qubit.
In this way, the reference oscillator is always in phase.4
