UNIQUE BARABANOV NORM IS NOT STRICTLY CONVEX
IAN D. MORRIS
Abstract. We construct a marginally stable linear switching system in con-
tinuous time, in four dimensions and with three switching st ates, which is
exponentially stable with respect to constant switching la ws and which has a
unique Barabanov norm, but such that the Barabanov norm fail s to be strictly
convex. This resolves a question of Y. Chitour, M. Gaye and P. Mason.
1.Introduction
1.1.Stability of linear switching systems. For every d≥1 letMd(R) denote
the vector space of all d×dreal matrices. If A⊂Md(R) is a compact nonempty
set, we will say that a trajectory of the linear switching system deﬁned by Ais any
absolutely continuous function x: [0,∞)→Rdwhich solves a diﬀerential equation
of the form

whichwerefertoasa switching law . Thisarticleisconcernedwithaquestionarising
from the stability classiﬁcation of linear switching systems.
The stability regimes of a linear switching system are typically classiﬁed into the
following categories (see e.g. [6, 18, 20, 26]): the linear switching sys tem deﬁned by
Ais calledexponentially stable if there exist C,κ >0 such that everytrajectory x(t)
satisﬁes/bardblx(t)/bardbl ≤Ce−κt/bardblx(0)/bardblfor allt≥0;exponentially unstable if there exists
a trajectory such that /bardblx(t)/bardbl ≥Ceκt/bardblx(0)/bardbl>0 for all t≥0, for some C,κ >0;
marginally stable if neither of the two previous cases applies, but there exists C >0
such that every trajectory satisﬁes /bardblx(t)/bardbl ≤C/bardblx(0)/bardblfor allt≥0; andmarginally
unstable if none of the preceding conditions applies, in which case one may show
that there necessarily exists an unbounded trajectory. If Ais a singleton set with
sole element Athen it is elementary that the four regimes may be distinguished
via the spectrum of Aas follows: if λ(A) denotes the maximum of the real parts
of the eigenvalues of Athen the system is exponentially stable if λ(A)<0 and
exponentially unstable if λ(A)>0; ifλ(A) = 0 then it is marginally stable if every
eigenvalue with zero real part is semisimple, and marginally unstable ot herwise.
In the case where Ais not a singleton set the situation is considerably more com-
plicated, and the search for veriﬁable criteria with which to determin e the stability
ofthe linearswitching system deﬁned by a set Ahas givenrise to a substantial body
of research (see for example [1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 16, 21, 24]). By analog y with the case
whereAis a singleton set one may deﬁne the topological top Lyapunov exponent of
12 IAN D. MORRIS
Ato be the quantity
Λ(A) := lim
t→∞sup
x1
tlog/parenleftbigg/bardblx(t)/bardbl
/bardblx(0)/bardbl/parenrightbigg
where the supremum is over all trajectories of the linear switching s ystem deﬁned
byAsuch that x(0) is nonzero. The existence of this limit is guaranteed by a
subadditivity argument, and if Ais a singleton set {A}then one simply has λ(A) =
Λ(A). It is not diﬃcult to show that exponential stability occurs precise ly when
Λ(A)<0 and exponential instability occurs precisely when Λ( A)>0. One may
also show that the quantity Λ( A) – and indeed the classiﬁcation of Aamong the
four stability regimes – is unaﬀected if Ais replaced by its convex hull, and for this
reason it is common to make the assumption that Ais convex (see [25]). On the
other hand the accurate computation of the quantity Λ( A) remains an unresolved
problem, with concise descriptions of Λ( A) being available only in very simple cases
(see e.g. [1, 2, 4]). In this article the set Awill usually be the convex hull of a ﬁnite
set of matrices {A1,...,A N}, and we will sometimes refer to the Nmatrices Aias
theswitching states of the linear switching system deﬁned by A.
1.2.Extremal norms and most unstable switching laws. A major source of
diﬃculty in computing the value of Λ( A) is simply that the class of all possible
switching laws is extremely large, and consequently the set of all tra jectories which
must be considered is, at least a priori, also extremely large. In response to this
problem a natural strategy is to try to reduce the breadth of the class of switching
laws which needs to be considered, hopefully by identifying some small class of
“worst-case” or “most-unstable” switching laws with the propert y that the system
is (for example) exponentially stable if and only if every trajectory x(t) of (1) in
whichA(t) is a worst-case switching law converges to the origin. (This strate gy
is applied for example in [4, 16, 21, 22], and also motivates works such a s [13].)
A precise mathematical meaning may be given to the concept of “mos t unstable
switching law” via the notions of extremal norm andBarabanov norm , as follows.
A norm|||·|||onRdis called extremal for the (compact, nonempty) set A⊂Md(R)
if the function t/mapsto→e−tΛ(A)|||x(t)|||is non-increasing along all trajectories xof the
linear switching system deﬁned by A. An extremal norm is called a Barabanov
normforAif additionally for every u∈Rdthere exists a trajectory xof the linear
switching system deﬁned by Asuch that x(0) =uand such that e−tΛ(A)|||x(t)|||is
constant with respect to t≥0. This allows one to deﬁne an extremal trajectory for
a given set Ato be a trajectory xsuch that |||x(t)|||=etΛ(A)|||x(0)|||>0 for every
t≥0 for some Barabanov norm |||·|||forA, and amost-unstable switching law to be
a switching law A: [0,∞)→Asuch that x′(t) =A(t)x(t) a.e. for some extremal
trajectory x. If a given set Ais replaced with the set ˆA:={A−Λ(A)I:A∈A}then
it is not diﬃcult to see that Λ( ˆA) = 0, that the extremal norms and Barabanov
norms of Aare identical with those of ˆA, and that x: [0,∞)→Rdis an extremal
trajectory for ˆAif and only if y(t) :=etΛ(A)x(t) is an extremal trajectory for A.
The study of extremal norms, Barabanov norms, extremal traj ectories and most-
unstable switching laws is therefore not substantially aﬀected by th e assumption
thatΛ(A) = 0andwewillfrequentlymakethisassumptioninthesequel. Subjec t to
this reduction it is clear that an extremal trajectory is precisely a t rajectory which
is conﬁned to a level set of a Barabanov norm, and the problem of un derstandingBARABANOV NORMS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY CONVEX 3
most-unstable switching laws is thus inherently tied to that of under standing the
geometry of Barabanov norms.
1.3.Geometry of Barabanov norms. Let us say that a set A⊂Md(R) is
reducible if there exists a linear subspace V⊂Rdsuch that AV⊆Vfor every
A∈Aand such that 0 <dimV < d. Let us also say that Aisirreducible if it
is not reducible. If A⊂Md(R) is compact and irreducible then the existence of
at least one Barabanov norm for Ais guaranteed by a foundational result due to
N.E. Barabanov [3]. It is clear that if |||·|||is a Barabanov norm for Athen so too is
every positive scalar multiple of |||·|||and in this sense the Barabanov norm of a set
Ais never unique. However, we will say that Ahas a unique Barabanov norm up
to scalar multiplication if the ratio of any two Barabanov norms for Ais constant,
and by mild abuse of language we will sometimes ﬁnd it convenient to say that
Ahas a unique Barabanov norm when this property holds for A. Some suﬃcient
conditions for the uniqueness of Barabanov norms in this sense hav e been given in
[5], and some examples of non-uniqueness of Barabanov norms are a lso presented
in that article.
In [5], Y. Chitour, M. Gaye and P. Mason considered the question of w hether
the unit ball of a Barabanov norm is necessarily strictly convex. Rela tive to this
question they noted an example M⊂M2(R) with two switching states given by
(2) M0:=/parenleftbigg0 0
0−1/parenrightbigg
, M 1:=/parenleftbiggα3

where the real number α≃ −0.88964...is chosen in such a way that the curve
t/mapsto→etA1(−1,0)Ttouches the vertical line {(1,y):y∈R}tangentially for a unique
positivet, and does not enter the open half-plane to the right of that line at a ny
positive time t. This system admits a unique Barabanov norm (see [5]) and this
norm isnotstrictly convex. The unit ball of this norm is illustrated in Figure 1.
For this system there always exists a uniqueextremal trajectory originating at each
point in R2\ {0}. When the initial condition x(0) lies in either of the two grey
(shaded) sectors in Figure 1 this unique extremal trajectory has constant switching
lawM0and proceeds along a straight line towards the horizontal axis. Whe n the
initial condition instead lies in the white (unshaded) region the unique e xtremal
trajectory follows a constant switching law corresponding to M1until it reaches
one of the two grey (shaded) sectors. At this point the switching la w changes
toM0and the trajectory again converges to the horizontal axis along a straight
vertical line. Chitour, Gaye and Mason’s example makes use of a zero eigenvalue
in the matrix M0to conﬁne certain trajectories to straight vertical lines, and this
naturally raises the question of whether the existence of such a ze ro eigenvalue is a
necessary condition for a system to admit a Barabanov norm which is not strictly
convex. This question was posed as Open Problem 4 in the article [5]. Th e purpose
of this article is to answer this question negatively, as follows:

Now deﬁne three matrices X0,X1,X2∈M4(R)by

and letX⊂M4(R)denote the convex hull of {X0,X1,X2}. Then the linear switch-
ing system deﬁned by Xis irreducible and marginally stable, and every element of
Xis a Hurwitz matrix. There exists a unique Barbanov norm for Xup to scalar
multiplication, and this norm is not strictly convex.
Here and elsewhere A⊗Bdenotes the Kronecker tensor product of the matrices
AandB, the properties of which are brieﬂy recalled for the reader’s beneﬁ t in§2
below.
Intuitively, the mechanism for constructing this example is to “expa nd” the one-
dimensional zero eigenspace of M0into a two-dimensional subspace which is invari-
ant under the two matrices X0andX1in such a way that {X0,X1}is marginallyBARABANOV NORMS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY CONVEX 5
stable when restricted to this subspace. From a more precise viewp oint, the ex-
ampleXmay be seen as a three-state subsystem of the six-state linear sw itching
system whose states are
A0⊗I+I⊗0, A 1⊗I+I⊗0,
A0⊗I+I⊗B0, A 1⊗I+I⊗B0,
A0⊗I+I⊗B1, A 1⊗I+I⊗B1.
This system admits trajectories which are given by the Kronecker t ensor product
of a trajectory of the system {A0,A1}with a trajectory of the system {0,B0,B1}.
In broad terms, our strategy will be to show that {A0,A1}has a unique Barabanov
norm, that this norm is not strictly convex, and that Barabanovno rms of the above
four-dimensional system are related to those of the two two-dime nsional systems
in a suitable way. This will allow us to show that the failure of strict conv exity
for the Barabanov norm of {A0,A1}is inherited by the four-dimensional, six-state
system deﬁned above. Since the six-state system includes a matrix A0⊗Iwhich
has zero eigenvalues it does not itself answer Chitour, Gaye and Mas on’s question,
but it is possible to show that the three-state system {X0,X1,X2}is irreducible,
has no Hurwitz matrices in its convex hull, and has the same Barabano v norms
as the six-state system, which allows us to obtain the conclusion of T heorem 1.
In practice this line of argument may be somewhat simpliﬁed by working directly
with the three-state system in the ﬁrst instance and omitting any r eference to the
six-state system described above, and this will be the approach wh ich we will take
in proving Theorem 1.
Similarlytothecaseforthe one-dimensionaleigenspacewhichispres ervedby M0
but not by M1, the two-dimensional subspace preserved by X0andX1is invariant
only for two of the three matrices Xiand not for the system Xas a whole. These
two examples therefore have in common the feature that there ex ists a proper
subset of the switching states which is marginally stable but preserv es an invariant
subspace. This suggests the following modiﬁcation of Chitour, Gaye and Mason’s
open problem:
Question 1. LetA⊂Md(R)be compact and irreducible, and suppose that there
doesnotexist a compact nonempty proper subset BofAwhich is reducible and
satisﬁes Λ(B) = Λ(A). Is it the case that every Barabanov norm for Ais strictly
convex?
1.4.Relationship with the discrete-time problem. As an aside, we remark
that for the corresponding problem of discrete-time linear switching systems the
study of the geometry of extremal norms is both highly developed a nd highly suc-
cessful. In the discrete-time problem, instead of (1) one consider s a trajectory to
be a sequence ( xn)∞
n=1of vectors in Rdsuch that xn+1=Anxnfor alln≥1, for
some sequence ( An)∈AN. Here the set A⊂Md(R) is compact and nonempty
but is no longer assumed convex. Similarly to the deﬁnition of Λ( A) above one
may consider the supremal rate of exponential growth of trajec tories of the linear
switching system deﬁned by a set A, which in this case coincides with the logarithm
of thejoint spectral radius ,
̺(A) := lim
n→∞max
A1,...,An∈A/bardblAn···A1/bardbl1
n,6 IAN D. MORRIS
a quantity which was introduced in [23] and which is now the subject of a very
extensive literature which we do not attempt to encompass here. T he same four
stability regimes may be deﬁned for the discrete-time linear switching system, and
extremal norms and Barabanov norms may be deﬁned in a similar mann er. In the
series of articles [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 19] it was demonstrated tha t in “typical”
cases there exists a Barabanov norm which is either piecewise aﬃne o r piecewise
quadratic, and that using these norms the joint spectral radius c an be computed
explicitly by an algorithmic procedure. For discrete-time linear switch ing systems
the classiﬁcation of Aas exponentially stable, exponentially unstable or otherwise
may therefore be satisfactorily resolved in typical cases by exploit ing the simple
geometryof the associatedBarabanovnorm. While the situation in t he continuous-
time case is far less developed, we suggest that the continued inves tigation of the
geometry of Barabanov norms holds some hope of the possibilty of d eveloping a
similar framework for the computation of the quantity Λ( A) and consequently for
the characterisation of the stability regimes of linear switching syst ems.
1.5.Structure of the article. In§2 below we present some generalfacts concern-
ing linear switching systems which will be useful throughout subsequ ent proofs. In
the succeeding two sections we investigate the planar linear switchin g systems de-
ﬁned by the sets {A0,A1},{B0,B1}and{0,B0,B1}, drawing on ideas from earlier
works such as [4, 5, 22]. In the ﬁnal section of this article we combine the results
of these analyses to prove Theorem 1.
2.Preliminaries
2.1.Notation. In this section we collect together some fundamental results which
will assist our exposition. Henceforth all convex sets A⊂Md(R) will be the convex
hull of a ﬁnite set {A0,...,A N} ⊂Md(R). Since every element of Amay be
writtenasaconvexcombinationofthe elements A0,...,A N, instead ofrepresenting
switching laws directly as functions A: [0,∞)→Awe will prefer to represent them
in the form

and we will subsequently use only this version of (1) when considering trajectories
of linear switching systems. Throughout the remainder of this artic le/bardbl · /bardblwill
always denote either the Euclidean norm or the corresponding oper ator norm on
matrices, according to context; the symbol |||·|||will be reserved for more general
norms.
2.2.The topological top Lyapunov exponent. The following key lemma will
allow us to simplify the calculation of the quantity Λ( A) by approximating trajec-
tories using matrix exponentials.BARABANOV NORMS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY CONVEX 7

Deﬁne ˆαi(t) = 0 for all t≥T. For each j= 0,...,k−1 it is clear that we
may partition the interval [ jT/k,(j+1)T/k) intoN+1 disjoint half-open intervals

ˆαN(t) to be 1 on the Nthinterval and zero on the remainder. In particular every ˆ αi
is zero on the ( N+1)stinterval. This construction clearly satisﬁes 0 ≤/summationtextN

Identical arguments show that ˆ xis alsoK-Lipschitz on [0 ,T]. By an intuitively
clear (but tedious and notationally awkward) inductive argument, ˆ x(T) has the
form
ˆx(T) =etk(N+1)ANetk(N+1)−1AN−1···et(k−1)(N+1)+1A0···et1A0x(0)
for some real numbers t1,...,tk(N+1)≥0 which correspond to the lengths of the
intervals in the construction and which therefore sum to T. Clearly by removing
those terms in which tj= 0 we may render this expression into the form given in
the statement of the lemma, so to conclude the proof of the lemma it suﬃces to
show that /bardblx(T)−ˆx(T)/bardbl ≤ε. By Gr¨ onwall’s inequality this will follow if

Using Corollary 2 we derive the following tool for computing values of Λ :
Proposition 3. LetA0,...,A N1,B0,...,B N2∈Md(R)and letAandBdenote
the convex hulls of {A0,...,A N1}and{B0,...,B N2}respectively. Then:
(i) IfA⊆BthenΛ(A)≤Λ(B).
(ii) LetCdenote the convex hull of {A0,...,A N1,B0,...,B N2}. If every Aicom-
mutes with every Bj, thenΛ(C) = max{Λ(A),Λ(B)}.
(iii) Let Ddenote the convex hull of {Ai+Bj: 0≤i≤N1,0≤j≤N2}. If every
Aicommutes with every Bj, thenΛ(D)≤Λ(A)+Λ(B).
Proof.To prove (i) we simply note that every trajectory of the linear switc hing
system deﬁned by Ais also a trajectory of the system deﬁned by B, and the in-
equality Λ( A)≤Λ(B) follows directly since the former quantity is a supremum over
a smaller set than the latter. To prove (ii) some additional notation w ill be helpful:
for every T >0 we deﬁne

Now, using commutativity any product of matrices of the form etiAioretjBjmay

2.3.Extremal norms. The following key result is proved in [3]:
Proposition 4. LetA⊂Md(R)be compact, convex and irreducible. Then there
exists a Barabanov norm for A.
The following straightforward result will give a simple condition for ver ifying
that a given norm is extremal:
Proposition 5. LetAdenote the convex hull of {A0,...,A N} ⊂Md(R)and let
f:Rd→Rbe continuous. Then t/mapsto→f(x(t))is non-increasing for every trajectory
xof the linear switching system deﬁned by Aif and only if t/mapsto→f(eAitv)is non-
increasing for every i= 0,...,Nand every v∈Rd.
Proof.Suppose that t/mapsto→f(eAitv) is non-increasing for every i= 0,...,Nand
everyv∈Rd. It follows easily by induction on kthat for every v∈Rd,k≥1,
t1,...,tk>0 and 0 ≤i1,...,ik≤Nwe have f(etkAik···et1Ai1v)≤f(v). By
Lemma 1 it follows directly that f(x(t))≤f(x(0)) for every t≥0, for every

2.4.Linear algebra. We ﬁrst recall some facts concerning the Kronecker product
on vectors and matrices, which will be frequently appealed to withou t comment in
the ﬁnal section of this article. Proofs of all of the properties men tioned may be
found in [14, §4.2]. Given two rectangular real matrices AandBwith respective
dimensions m1×m2andn1×n2, the Kronecker tensor product A⊗Bis deﬁned
to be the m1n1×m2n2matrix given by
A⊗B=
a11B···a1m2B
.........
am11B···am1m2B
.
The relations λ(A⊗B) = (λA)⊗B=A⊗(λB), where λ∈R, are obvious. If A1
andA2are rectangular matrices of the same dimensions then it is also clear t hat
(A1+A2)⊗B=A1⊗B+A2⊗Bfor every rectangular matrix B, and likewise if
B1andB2are rectangular matrices of the same dimensions then A⊗(B1+B2) =
A⊗B1+A⊗B2for every rectangular matrix A. The relation /bardblA⊗B/bardbl=/bardblA/bardbl·/bardblB/bardbl
is satisﬁed for every pair of rectangular matrices AandB, where/bardbl·/bardbldenotes the
Euclidean operator norm on matrices. In particular if uandvare column vectors
of respective dimensions d1andd2thenu⊗vis a column vector of dimension d1d2
andwith norm /bardblu⊗v/bardbl=/bardblu/bardbl·/bardblv/bardbl. Ife1,...,e d1andf1,...,f d2denote the standard
bases ofRd1andRd2respectively then it is easily seen that the vectors ei⊗fjmake
up the standard basis for Rd1d2, and it is an easily exercise to deduce that every
element of Rd1d2can be written as the sum of not more than min {d1,d2}vectors
of the form u⊗v. In particular every element of R4can be written in the form
u⊗v+ ˆu⊗ˆvfor some u,v,ˆu,ˆv∈R2, a fact which will be applied in §5 below.
IfA1andA2are rectangular matrices of the same dimensions, B1andB2are
rectangular matrices of the same dimensions, and the dimensions of these matrices
are such that the products A1A2andB1B2are well-deﬁned, then the relation
(A1⊗B1)(A2⊗B2) = (A1A2)⊗(B1B2) is satisﬁed. If AandBare square matrices
then the eigenvalues of A⊗Bare precisely those numbers which may be obtained
as the product of a eigenvalue of Awith an eigenvalue of B. IfAandBare square
matrices then it is easily seen that the matrices A⊗IandI⊗Bcommute and that
eA⊗I+I⊗B= (eA⊗I)(I⊗eB) =eA⊗eB, a fact which will be important in §5.
The following result can be obtained as a consequence of Schur’s the orem on
simultaneous triangularisation. For a proof we direct the reader to [15, Theorem
2.4.8.1].
Proposition 6. LetA,B∈Md(R)and suppose that AandBcommute. Then
every eigenvalue of A+Bis equal tothe sum of an eigenvalue of Aand an eigenvalue

3.Analysis of the first two-dimensional system
The following result modiﬁes the earlier-mentioned example of Chitour , Gaye
and Mason (speciﬁcally, [5, Example 3]) and presents the properties of the modiﬁed
example at a level of detail which is suitable for later application.
Theorem 2. LetA0,A1∈M2(R)be as deﬁned in the statement of Theorem 1,
and letA⊂M2(R)denote their convex hull. Then:

We next demonstrate that |||·|||Ais non-increasing along every trajectory of the
linear switching system deﬁned by A. By Proposition 5 it is suﬃcient to show
that/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleetAiv/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

Totreatthe case i= 0weargueasfollows. Supposethat v= (v1,v2)T∈R2belongs
to the closed unit ball ofthe norm |||·|||A. We claim that necessarily |v1| ≤1. Indeed,
ifv1>1 then for small enough ε >0 the vector (1 −ε)·(1,0)T+ε(v1,v2)Thas

ball of|||·|||Asince it is a convex combination of two vectors which are elements
of the closed unit ball. This is a contradiction and we conclude that v1≤1. If
v1<−1 then a similar contradiction arises by considering the norm of the ve ctor
(1−ε)·(−1,0)T+ε(v1,v2)Tand we conclude that |v1| ≤1 as claimed. Since
|v1| ≤1 it follows via (13) that ( v1,0)Tbelongs to the closed unit ball. For every
t≥0 the vector etA0v= (v1,e−tv2)Tis a convex combination of the two vectors
(v1,v2)Tand (v1,0)Tboth of which belong to the unit ball, and we conclude that/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleetA0v/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
A≤1 =|||v|||Aas required. By homogeneitythe same result holds for every
v∈R2. The hypotheses of Proposition 5 are therefore satisﬁed and we c onclude
that|||x(t)|||Ais non-increasing for every trajectory x(t) of the linear switching
system deﬁned by A.
We may now prove (i). A simple calculation shows that every A∈Aother than
A0has negative trace and positive determinant and is therefore Hurw itz. It is clear
thatAis irreducible: if every element of Apreserves a nontrivial proper subspace
ofR2then that subspace must be one-dimensional, but A1has no real eigenvectors
and therefore cannot preserve a one-dimensional real vector s pace. Since |||·|||Ais
non-increasing along trajectories of the linear switching system de ﬁned by Ait
follows directly that Λ( A)≤0. On the other hand since etA0u=ufor allt≥0
whenever u∈R2lies on the horizontal axis, the linear switching system deﬁned
byAadmits constant trajectories and it follows that Λ( A)≥0. We conclude that
Λ(A) = 0 and that |||·|||Ais an extremal norm for A. In particular we have proved
(i).
We next claim that |||·|||Ais a Barabanov norm for A. Letv= (v1,v2)T∈R2be
nonzero, and observe that since clearly/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglee−(τ+π)v1cos(τ+π)+e−(τ+π)v2sin(τ+π)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=e−π/vextendsingle/vextendsinglee−τv1cosτ+e−τv2sinτ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

We have now proved every clause of (i) and (ii) except for the uniqu eness of the
Barabanovnorm |||·|||A, which we postpone until after proving (iii). Let x: [0,∞)→

It follows that for a.e. t≥0

2(t)x2(t) =−2α(t)x1(t)2−2x2(t)2≤ −2α(t)(x1(t)2+x2(t)2)

all cases lim t→∞x(t) exists and lies on the horizontal axis, and if lim t→∞x(t) is
nonzero then/integraltext∞
0α(s)ds <∞. This proves (iii).
To complete the proof we must establish the uniqueness of |||·|||Aas a Barabanov
norm. Suppose that |||·|||1and|||·|||2are both Barabanov norms for A. By continuity
and compactness there exists a vector on the Euclidean unit circle in R2which
attains the maximum value of the ratio |||·|||1/|||·|||2onR2\{0}, so using the Bara-
banov property of |||·|||1letx(t) be a trajectory such that |||x(t)|||1=|||x(0)|||1for all
t≥0 and such that x(0) maximises |||·|||1/|||·|||2. Since|||·|||2is an extremal norm we
have|||x(t)|||2≤ |||x(0)|||2for allt≥0, so
|||x(t)|||1
|||x(t)|||2≤|||x(0)|||1
|||x(0)|||2≤|||x(0)|||1
|||x(t)|||2=|||x(t)|||1
|||x(t)|||2
for allt≥0, where in the ﬁrst inequality we have used the fact that x(0) maximises
|||·|||1/|||·|||2. In particular we have |||x(t)|||1/|||x(t)|||2=|||x(0)|||1/|||x(0)|||2for every
t≥0. By (ii) the limit lim t→∞x(t) exists and lies on the horizontal axis, andBARABANOV NORMS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY CONVEX 15
this limit is clearly nonzero since |||x(t)|||1=|||x(0)|||1>0 for every t≥0. We
deduce that the ratio |||·|||1/|||·|||2attains its maximum on the horizontal axis. But
this argument is symmetric with respect to the roles of |||·|||1and|||·|||2, so the ratio
|||·|||2/|||·|||1alsoattains its maximum on the horizontal axis. The ratio |||·|||1/|||·|||2
thus attains its maximum and its minimum at the same place, so its maximu m and
minimum are equal and it is perforce constant. We have proved the u niqueness of
the Barabanov norm for Aand the proof of the theorem is now complete. /square
4.Analysis of the second two-dimensional system
The following result establishes some useful properties of the syst ems{B0,B1}
and{0,B0,B1}. It is similar in character to earlier works which also considered
marginally stable linear switching systems whose trajectories rotat e around the
origin (such as [21, 22] and parts of [4, 16]) but the properties of th e system which
are of interest to us have mostly not been stated explicitly in earlier r esearch.
Theorem 3. Letλ,B0andB1be as in the statement of Theorem 1. Let Bdenote
the convex hull of {B0,B1}and letB0denote the convex hull of {0,B0,B1}. Then:
(i) Both BandB0are irreducible and marginally stable, and every element of B0
is Hurwitz except for the zero matrix.
(ii) There exists a norm |||·|||BonR2which is a Barabanov norm for Band for
B0. Up to scalar multiplication it is the unique extremal norm f orBand is
also the unique extremal norm for B0.
(iii) Let α,β: [0,∞)→[0,1]be Lebesgue measurable functions such that 0≤α(t)+
β(t)≤1a.e, and let y: [0,∞)→R2be an absolutely continuous function such
that
y′(t) = (1−α(t)−β(t))B0y(t)+β(t)B1y(t)
a.e. and such that y(0)/\e}atio\slash= 0. Suppose that/integraltext∞

for every nonzero w∈R2there exists an increasing sequence of real numbers
(tn)∞
n=1diverging to inﬁnity such that /bardbly(tn)/bardbl−1y(tn) =/bardblw/bardbl−1wfor every
n≥1.
(iv) For every w∈R2there exists a Lebesgue measurable function β: [0,∞)→
[0,1]such that the solution y: [0,∞)→R2to the initial value problem
y′(t) = (1−β(t))B0y(t)+β(t)B1y(t), y(0) =w
is periodic.

0 = Λ(B)≤Λ(B0)≤max{Λ(B),Λ({0})}= 0
where we have used parts (i) and (ii) of Proposition 3. Since B0has non-real
eigenvaluesit cannot preservea one-dimensionalsubspace of R2and therefore every
subset of M2(R) which includes B0is irreducible. In particular both B0andBare
irreducible. It follows from Proposition 4 that there exists a Baraba nov norm |||·|||B

by Corollary 2 and in particular λis strictly positive. Clearly every element of B
has trace −2λ <0 and a simple calculation shows that every element of Balso has
positive determinant. In combination these properties imply that ev ery eigenvalue
of every element of Bhas negative real part, which is to say that every element of
Bis Hurwitz. Since every nonzero element of B0is a positive scalar multiple of an
element of Bit follows that every nonzero element of B0is Hurwitz as required. We
have proved (i) and the existence clause of (ii).
In order to derive the uniqueness clause of (ii) we must ﬁrst prove ( iii) and (iv).
Suppose that α,βandyare as in (iii) and that/integraltext∞
0(1−α(t))dtis divergent, and
letw∈R2be an arbitrary nonzero vector. Deﬁne r(φ) := (cos φ,sinφ)T∈R2for
everyφ∈R. Writey(t) in polar co-ordinates as y(t) =n(t)r(θ(t)) for all t≥0,
wheren(t) :=/bardbly(t)/bardblfor allt≥0 and where θ: [0,∞)→Ris continuous. It is clear
thatnandθare absolutely continuous, so for a.e. t≥0 we have

In particular θis non-decreasing with respect to t. Ifθ(t) increased to a ﬁnite

We conclude that instead lim t→∞θ(t) = +∞, and it follows that there exists an
increasing sequence of positive real numbers ( tn)∞

r(θ(tn)) =/bardblw/bardbl−1wfor every n≥1. Clearly this implies /bardbly(tn)/bardbl−1y(tn) =/bardblw/bardbl−1w
for every n≥1 as required to prove (iii).
We now prove (iv). If w∈R2is the zero vector then every trajectory ysuch
thaty(t) = 0 is constant, so we suppose that w∈R2is nonzero. Since |||·|||Bis
a Barabanov norm for Bthere exist a measurable function ˆβ: [0,∞)→Rand
absolutely continuous function ˆ y: [0,∞)→R2such that
ˆy′(t) = (1−ˆβ(t))B0ˆy(t)+ˆβ(t)B1ˆy(t),ˆy(0) =w
for a.e. t≥0 and such that additionally |||ˆy(t)|||B=|||ˆy(0)|||Bfor allt≥0. It
follows from (iii) that there exists T >0 such that /bardblˆy(T)/bardbl−1ˆy(T) =/bardblw/bardbl−1w=
/bardblˆy(0)/bardbl−1ˆy(0). Consequently
|||ˆy(T)|||B
/bardblˆy(T)/bardbl=|||ˆy(0)|||B
/bardblˆy(0)/bardbl
and since |||ˆy(T)|||B=|||ˆy(0)|||Bthis implies /bardblˆy(0)/bardbl=/bardblˆy(T)/bardbl. In particular we have
ˆy(T) = ˆy(0). Now deﬁne β: [0,∞)→[0,1] to be periodic with period Tand such
thatβ(t) =ˆβ(t) for allt∈[0,T], and similarly let y: [0,∞)→R2be periodic with
periodTand such that y(t) = ˆy(t) for allt∈[0,T]. It is clear that yis absolutely
continuous and periodic and solves an initial value problem of the type required for
it to be a trajectory of the linear switching system deﬁned by B. This proves (iv).
We now prove that |||·|||Bis the unique extremal norm for Bup to scalar multipli-
cation, which implies that it is also the unique extremal norm for B0. Suppose that
|||·|||is also an extremal norm for B. By (iv) we may choose a periodic trajectory
yof the linear switching system deﬁned by B, wherey(0) is an arbitrary nonzero
vector. Since |||·|||and|||·|||Bare extremal norms for B, the functions t/mapsto→ |||y(t)|||and
t/mapsto→ |||y(t)|||Bare non-increasing; but by the periodicity of y, these two functions are
also periodic. They are therefore constant, so the ratio |||y(t)|||B/|||y(t)|||is constant
with respect to t≥0. Now if w∈R2is any nonzero vector, by (iii) there exists
t0≥0 such that /bardbly(t0)/bardbl−1y(t0) =/bardblw/bardbl−1w. In particular
|||w|||B
|||w|||=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/bardblw/bardbl−1w/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

constant on R2\{0}. Thus|||·|||Bis a scalar multiple of |||·|||as required. The proof
of the theorem is complete. /square
5.Proof of Theorem 1
5.1.Irreducibility. We ﬁrst prove that Xis irreducible. Let X⊆M4(R) denote
the algebra generated by X, i.e. the linear span of the set of all ﬁnite nonempty
products of elements of X. IfVis a vector subspace of R4which is preserved by
every element of Xthen it is clear that it is also preserved by every element of
X, so to show that Xis irreducible it is suﬃcient to show that Xis irreducible.
For each i,jin the range 1 ≤i,j≤4 letEijdenote the 4 ×4 matrix with 1 in
position ( i,j) and all other entries zero. We will show that all of the matrices Eij
are elements of X, from which it follows that X=M4(R) and hence that Xis
irreducible.18 IAN D. MORRIS

EiiZ8Ejj∈ {Eij,−Eij}
and therefore Eij∈Xfor every i,j= 1,2,3,4. We deduce that X=M4(R) as
claimed and we have proved that Xis irreducible.BARABANOV NORMS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY CONVEX 19
5.2.Stability properties. We next show that Xis marginally stable and that
all of its elements are Hurwitz matrices. For every k≥1,i1,...,ik∈ {0,1}and
t1,...,tk>0 we have
/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleetkXik···et1Xi1/vextenddouble/vextenddouble=/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoublee(t1+···+tk)A0⊗/parenleftbig
etkBik···et1Bi1/parenrightbig/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble=/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleetkBik···et1Bi1/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
where we have used the fact that /bardbletA0/bardbl= 1 for every t≥0. It follows directly
using Corollary 2 that Λ( X)≥Λ(B). On the other hand, since clearly
X⊂ {A⊗I+I⊗B:A∈AandB∈B0}
andsincematricesofthe form A⊗IandI⊗Bcommute, it followsusingProposition
3(iii) that Λ( X)≤Λ(A)+Λ(B0). Combining these inequalities with Theorem 2(i)
andTheorem3(i)showsthatΛ( X) = 0. Since XisirreducibleitadmitsaBarabanov
norm by Proposition 4 and this implies that it is marginally stable.
Now let us show that every X∈Xis Hurwitz. If X∈Xis a convex combination
ofX0andX1only, then it has the form A0⊗I+I⊗Bfor some B∈B. By Theorem
3(i) the matrix Bis Hurwitz, and it is clear by inspection that every eigenvalue of
A0has non-positive real part. Every eigenvalue of A0⊗Iis an eigenvalue of A0
and every eigenvalue of I⊗Bis an eigenvalue of B, and the two matrices A0⊗I
andI⊗Bcommute, so it follows by Proposition 6 that every eigenvalue of Xis the
sum of a number with non-positive real part and a number with negat ive real part.
Hence in this case Xis Hurwitz. If on the other hand Xis a convex combination of
X0,X1andX2with nonzero contribution from X2, then it may be written in the
formA⊗I+I⊗BwhereA∈Ais not equal to A0and where B∈B0. By Theorem
2(i) the matrix Ais Hurwitz, and by Theorem 3(i) the matrix Bis either Hurwitz
or zero. It follows that A⊗Iis Hurwitz and that I⊗Bis either Hurwitz or zero,
and we may again apply Proposition 6 to deduce that Xis Hurwitz as required.
We have proved that every element of Xis Hurwitz.
5.3.Uniqueness of the Barabanov norm. SinceXis irreducible it admits at
least one Barabanov norm; we now wish to show that this norm is uniqu e up to
scalar multiplication. Our strategy will be as follows. Let e1,e2∈R2denote the
standard basis vectors. Given any two Barabanov norms |||·|||1and|||·|||2forX, we
will show that the ratio |||·|||1/|||·|||2attains its maximum at the vector e1⊗e1∈
R4. Since this result is equally applicable when the roles of |||·|||1and|||·|||2are
interchanged, it followsthat |||·|||2/|||·|||1must attain its maximum at the same place;
but then the maximum and minimum of the ratio |||·|||1/|||·|||2are attained at the
same location, which implies that the ratio of the two norms is constan t as desired.
Let us therefore ﬁx two Barabanov norms |||·|||1and|||·|||2forX. We proceed in two
stages: we ﬁrst show that |||·|||1/|||·|||2is maximised at a vector of the form e1⊗v,
and then subsequently deduce that it is maximised at e1⊗e1.
By homogeneity, every value taken by |||·|||1/|||·|||2at a nonzero vector is also
taken at a Euclidean unit vector, so by compactness this ratio atta ins its maximum
at some nonzero vector in R4. Every element of R4may be written in the form
u⊗v+ ˆu⊗ˆvfor some u,v,ˆu,ˆv∈R2, so choose such vectors u,v,ˆu,ˆvwithuand
vnonzero such that |||·|||1/|||·|||2is maximised at u⊗v+ ˆu⊗ˆv. Since |||·|||1is a
Barabanov norm for Xthere exists a trajectory z: [0,∞)→R4of the switched
system deﬁned by Xsuch that z(0) =u⊗v+ ˆu⊗ˆvand|||z(t)|||1=|||z(0)|||1for all
t≥0. Letα,β: [0,∞)→[0,1] be measurable functions such that 0 ≤α+β≤120 IAN D. MORRIS
and such that
z′(t) = (1−α(t)−β(t))X0z(t)+β(t)X1z(t)+α(t)X2z(t)
for a.e.t≥0. Now let x,y,ˆx,ˆy: [0,∞)→R2solve the initial value problems
x′(t) = (1−α(t))A0x(t)+α(t)A1x(t), x(0) =u,
ˆx′(t) = (1−α(t))A0ˆx(t)+α(t)A1ˆx(t),ˆx(0) = ˆu,
y′(t) = (1−α(t)−β(t))B0y(t)+β(t)B1y(t), y(0) =v,
ˆy′(t) = (1−α(t)−β(t))B0ˆy(t)+β(t)B1ˆy(t),ˆy(0) = ˆv.
Since
z(0) =x(0)⊗y(0)+ ˆx(0)⊗ˆy(0)
and for a.e. t≥0
z′(t) =x′(t)⊗y(t)+x(t)⊗y′(t)+ ˆx′(t)⊗ˆy(t)+ ˆx(y)⊗ˆy′(t)
it follows that z(t) andx(t)⊗y(t)+ˆx(t)⊗ˆy(t) solve the same initial value problem
and are consequently identical. Moreover xand ˆxare trajectories of the linear
switched system deﬁned by A, andyand ˆyare trajectories of the linear switching
system deﬁned by B0. By Theorem 2(iii) both x(t) and ˆx(t) converge as t→
∞to vectors on the horizontal axis in R2, so we have lim t→∞x(t) =γe1and
limt→∞x(t) = ˆγe1for some real numbers γ,ˆγ, say. Since B0is marginally stable
the trajectories yand ˆyare bounded, so we may choose an increasing sequence
(tn)∞
n=1which diverges to inﬁnity such that the limits w:= lim n→∞y(tn) and
ˆw:= lim n→∞ˆy(tn) exist. In particular we have
lim
n→∞z(tn) = lim
n→∞x(tn)⊗y(tn)+ ˆx(tn)⊗ˆy(tn) = (γe1)⊗w+(ˆγe1)⊗ˆw
=e1⊗(γw+ ˆγˆw).
Bydeﬁnition |||z(tn)|||1=|||z(0)|||1foralln≥1, so|||e1⊗(γw+ ˆγˆw)|||1=|||z(0)|||1>
0 and the limit vector e1⊗(γw+ ˆγˆw) is nonzero. Since |||·|||2is an extremal norm
forXwe have |||z(tn)|||2≤ |||z(0)|||2for alln≥1, so for all n≥1
|||z(0)|||1
|||z(0)|||2=|||z(tn)|||1
|||z(0)|||2≤|||z(tn)|||1
|||z(tn)|||2≤|||z(0)|||1
|||z(0)|||2
where the ﬁnal inequality uses the fact that the ratio |||·|||1/|||·|||2is maximised at
z(0). Taking the limit as n→ ∞yields
|||z(0)|||1
|||z(0)|||2=|||e1⊗(γw+ ˆγˆw)|||1
|||e1⊗(γw+ ˆγˆw)|||2
and we have shown that |||·|||1/|||·|||2is maximised at a vector of the form claimed.
Now let e1⊗vbe a vector at which |||·|||1/|||·|||2is maximised, and let us show
that|||·|||1/|||·|||2is also maximised at e1⊗e1. Similarly to before, let z: [0,∞)→R4
be a trajectory of the switched system deﬁned by Xsuch that z(0) =e1⊗vand
|||z(t)|||1=|||z(0)|||1for allt≥0. Letα,β: [0,∞)→[0,1] be measurable functions
such that 0 ≤α+β≤1 and such that
z′(t) = (1−α(t)−β(t))X0z(t)+β(t)X1z(t)+α(t)X2z(t)
for a.e.t≥0, and let x,y: [0,∞)→R2solve the initial value problems
x′(t) = (1−α(t))A0x(t)+α(t)A1x(t), x(0) =e1,
y′(t) = (1−α(t)−β(t))B0y(t)+β(t)B1y(t), y(0) =v.BARABANOV NORMS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY CONVEX 21
Once more we have z(t) =x(t)⊗y(t) for all t≥0 since both functions solve the
same initial value problem. Since |||x(t)⊗y(t)|||1=|||z(0)|||1>0 for all t≥0 we
have liminf t→∞/bardblx(t)⊗y(t)/bardbl>0, and since yis a trajectory of the marginally
stable linear switching system deﬁned by B0, we have limsupt→∞/bardbly(t)/bardbl<∞. It
follows that
liminf
t→∞/bardblx(t)/bardbl= liminf
t→∞/bardblx(t)⊗y(t)/bardbl
/bardbly(t)/bardbl>0
and in particular x(t) does not converge to zero in the limit as t→ ∞. It follows by
Theorem 2 that lim t→∞x(t) =γ1·e1for some nonzero real number γ1and that the
integral/integraltext∞
0α(t)dtis convergent. The integral/integraltext∞
0(1−α(t))dtis therefore divergent,
so by Theorem 3 there exists an increasing sequence ( tn)∞
n=1which diverges to
inﬁnity such that /bardbly(tn)/bardbl−1y(tn) =e1for every n≥1. By passing to a subsequence
we may assume without loss of generality that lim n→∞y(tn) exists, and we write
this limit as γ2·e1. We therefore have lim n→∞z(tn) = lim n→∞x(tn)⊗y(tn) =
(γ1e1)⊗(γ2e1) =γ(e1⊗e1), say. Since |||z(tn)|||1=|||z(0)|||1>0 for all n≥1 it
follows that γis nonzero. For every n≥1 we have
|||z(0)|||1
|||z(0)|||2=|||z(tn)|||1
|||z(0)|||2≤|||z(tn)|||1
|||z(tn)|||2≤|||z(0)|||1
|||z(0)|||2
using the fact that |||z(tn)|||1=|||z(0)|||1for alln≥1, the fact that |||z(tn)|||2≤
|||z(0)|||2for alln≥1, and the fact that |||·|||1/|||·|||2is maximised at z(0). Taking
the limit as n→ ∞yields
|||z(0)|||1
|||z(0)|||2=|||γ(e1⊗e1)|||1
|||γ(e1⊗e1)|||2=|||e1⊗e1|||1
|||e1⊗e1|||2
and we have shown that |||·|||1/|||·|||2is maximised at the vector e1⊗e1.
Combining the above steps, we have shown that if |||·|||1and|||·|||2are any two
Barabanovnorms for Xthen the ratio |||·|||1/|||·|||2is maximised at e1⊗e1. Since this
applies equally with the roles of |||·|||1and|||·|||2interchanged, the ratio |||·|||2/|||·|||1
is maximised at the same vector. The ratio |||·|||1/|||·|||2is thus both maximised and
minimised at the same point, and the ratio is consequently constant o n nonzero
elements of R4. We have proved the uniqueness of the Barabanov norm for Xup
to scalar multiplication.
5.4.Failure of strict convexity for the Barabanov norm. Let|||·|||be a Bara-
banov norm for X. It remains to show that |||·|||is not strictly convex. Let u,v∈R2
be nonzero vectors,
u=/parenleftbiggu1

, v=/parenleftbiggv1
v2/parenrightbigg
,
where|u2| ≤ |u1|. We claim that

Sinceu2∈[−u1,u1] can be chosen arbitrarily when the other variables u1,v1,v2
are ﬁxed, this implies that |||·|||is constant on a line segment and consequently is
not strictly convex.
We approach (14) by proving the two directions of inequality separa tely. We
begin by showing that the left-hand side of (14) is greater than or e qual to the
right-hand side. In this we require only the fact that |||·|||is an extremal norm for22 IAN D. MORRIS
X. By Theorem 3(iv) there exist a measurable function β: [0,∞)→[0,1] and an
absolutely continuous function y: [0,∞)→R2such that
y′(t) = (1−β(t))B0y(t)+β(t)B1y(t)
a.e, such that y(0) =v, and such that yis periodic with some period τ >0, say.
Letz: [0,∞)→R4be the trajectory of Xwhich solves
z′(t) = (1−β(t))X0z(t)+β(t)X1z(t), z(0) =u⊗v.
Then we have z(t) = (etA0x(0))⊗y(t) for allt≥0, and therefore using the period-

and this gives one direction of inequality in (14).
We now prove the other direction of inequality. Using the fact that |||·|||is a
Barabanov norm for X, letz: [0,∞)→R4be a trajectory of the linear switched
system deﬁned by Xsuch that z(0) =u⊗vand|||z(t)|||=|||z(0)|||for allt≥0, and
letα,β: [0,∞)→[0,1] be measurable functions such that 0 ≤α+β≤1 and such
that
z′(t) = (1−α(t)−β(t))X0z(t)+β(t)X1z(t)+α(t)X2z(t)
for a.e.t≥0. Letx,y: [0,∞)→R2solve the initial value problems
x′(t) = (1−α(t))A0x(t)+α(t)A1x(t), x(0) =u,
y′(t) = (1−α(t)−β(t))B0y(t)+β(t)B1y(t), y(0) =v,
and observe as before that z(t) =x(t)⊗y(t) for allt≥0, thatxis a trajectory of
the linear switching system deﬁned by A, and that yis a trajectory of the linear
switching system deﬁned by B0. Let|||·|||Aand|||·|||Bbe the norms on R2which
were constructed in Theorems 2 and 3 respectively. Since |||z(t)|||=|||z(0)|||>0
for allt≥0, and since y(t) is bounded with respect to t, it is impossible that
limt→∞x(t) = 0 and we deduce using Theorem 2(iii) that necessarily/integraltext∞
0α(t)dt <
∞. By Theorem 3(iii) there consequently exists a sequence of positive real numbers
(tn) diverging to inﬁnity such that /bardbly(tn)/bardbl−1y(tn) =/bardbly(0)/bardbl−1y(0) for every n≥1,
so we have y(tn) = (|||y(tn)|||B/|||y(0)|||B)y(0) for all n≥1. Since yis a trajectory
of the linear switching system deﬁned by B0, and since |||·|||Bis an extremal norm

A.BARABANOV NORMS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY CONVEX 23
Here we have used the fact that x(t) is a trajectory of the linear switching system
deﬁned by A, the fact that |||·|||Ais an extremal norm for A, and (13). Thus we have
