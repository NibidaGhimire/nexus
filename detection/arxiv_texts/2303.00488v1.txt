Abstract
In this note, we study the optimal control of a nonisothermal phase ﬁeld system of
Cahn–Hilliard type that constitutes an extension of the cla ssical Caginalp model for
nonisothermal phasetransitions with a conserved order par ameter. Thesystem cou-
ples a Cahn–Hilliard type equation with source term for the o rder parameter with
the universal balance law of internal energy. In place of the standard Fourier form,
the constitutive law of the heat ﬂux is assumed in the form giv en by the theory de-
veloped by Green and Naghdi, which accounts for a possible th ermal memory of the
evolution. Thishas theconsequence that thebalance law of i nternal energy becomes
a second-order in time equation for the thermal displacement orfreezing index , that
is, aprimitive withrespectto timeof thetemperature. Anot her particular featureof
our system is the presence of the source term in the equation f or the order parame-
ter, which entails additional mathematical diﬃculties bec ausethemass conservation
of the order parameter, typical of the classic Cahn–Hilliar d equation, is no longer
satisﬁed. In this paper, we analyze the case that the double- well potential driving
12 Colli – Gilardi – Signori – Sprekels
the evolution of the phase transition is diﬀerentiable, eith er (in the regular case) on
the whole set of reals or (in the singular logarithmic case) o n a ﬁnite open interval;
nondiﬀerentiable cases like the doubleobstacle potential a re excluded from the anal-
ysis. We prove the Fr´ echet diﬀerentiability of the control- to-state operator between
suitable Banach spaces for both the regular and the logarith mic cases and establish
the solvability of the corresponding adjoint systems in ord er to derive the associated
ﬁrst-order necessary optimality conditions for the optima l control problem. Crucial
for the whole analysis to work is the so-called “strict separ ation property”, which
states that the order parameter attains its values in a compa ct subset of the interior
of the eﬀective domain of the nonlinearity. While this separa tion property turns
out to be generally valid for regular potentials in three dim ensions of space, it can
be shown for the logarithmic case only in two dimensions.

1 Introduction
Let Ω⊂Rd,d∈ {2,3}, be some open, bounded, and connected set having a smooth
boundary Γ := ∂Ω and the outward unit normal ﬁeld n. Denoting by ∂nthe directional
derivative in the direction of n, and putting, with a ﬁxed ﬁnal time T >0,
Qt:= Ω×(0,t) and Σ t:= Γ×(0,t) fort∈(0,T], as well as Q:=QTand Σ := Σ T,
we study in this paper as state system the following initial-boundary value problem:
∂tϕ−∆µ+γϕ=f inQ, (1.1)
µ=−∆ϕ+F′(ϕ)+a−b∂tw inQ, (1.2)

∂nϕ=∂nµ=∂n(κ1∂tw+κ2w) = 0 on Σ , (1.4)
ϕ(0) =ϕ0, w(0) =w0, ∂tw(0) =w1in Ω. (1.5)

For the control variable u, we choose as control space

whereumin,umax∈L∞(Q) satisfyumin≤umaxalmost everywhere in Q.
In summary, the control problem under investigation can be refor mulated as follows:

The state system (1.1)–(1.5) is a formal extension of the nonisoth ermal Cahn–Hilliard
system introduced by Caginalp in [4] to model the phenomenon of non isothermal phase
segregation in binary mixtures (see also [3,5] and the derivation in [2, Ex. 4.4.2, (4.44),
(4.46)]); it corresponds to the Allen–Cahn counterpart analyzed r ecently in [13]. The
unknowns in the state system have the following physical meaning: ϕis a normalized
diﬀerence between the volume fractions of pure phases in the binar y mixture (the dimen-
sionlessorder parameter of the phase transformation, which should attain its values in
the interval [ −1,1]),µis the associated chemical potential , andwis the so-called ther-
mal displacement (orfreezing index ), which is directly connected to the temperature ϑ
(which in the case of the Caginalp model is actually a temperature diﬀe rence) through
the relation
w(·,t) =w0+/integraldisplayt
0ϑ(·,s)ds, t∈[0,T]. (1.9)
Moreover,κ1andκ2in (1.3) stand for prescribed positive coeﬃcients related to the hea t
ﬂux, which is here assumed in the Green–Naghdi form (see [19–21,2 6])
q=−κ1∇(∂tw)−κ2∇wwhereκi>0,i= 1,2, (1.10)
which accounts for a possible previous thermal history of the phen omenon. Moreover, γ
is a positive physical constant related to the intensity of the mass a bsorption/production
of the source, where the source term in (1.1) is S:=f−γϕ. This term reﬂects the
fact that the system may not be isolated and the loss or production of mass is possible,
which happens, e.g., in numerous liquid-liquid phase segregation proble ms that arise in
cell biology [15] and in tumor growth models [17]. Notice that the pres ence of the source
term entails that the property of mass conservation of the order parameter is no longer
valid; in fact, from (1.1) it directly follows that the mass balance has t he form

where|Ω|denotes the volume of Ω. To this concern, we would like to quote the p aper [8],
where a comparable Cahn–Hilliard system without mass conservation was examined from
the optimal control viewpoint. Moreover, we refer to [6,7,12,23 ,25,27,31], where similar
systems have been analyzed. For optimal control problems involvin g sparsity eﬀects, let
us mention [14,16,28,30]. Also, let us incidentally point out that the d iﬀerential structure
of equation (1.3), with respect to w, is sometimes also referred to as the strongly damped
wave equation , see, e.g., [24] and the references therein.4 Colli – Gilardi – Signori – Sprekels
In addition to the quantities already introduced, λstands for the latent heat of the
phase transformation, a,bare physical constants, and the control variable uis a dis-
tributed heat source/sink. Besides, ϕ0,w0,andw1indicate some given initial values.
Finally, the function Fis assumed to have a double-well shape. Prototypical choices for
the double-well shaped nonlinearity Fare the regular and singular logarithmic potential
and its common (nonsingular) polynomial approximation, the regular potential . In the
order, they are deﬁned as
Flog(r) :=/braceleftbigg
(1+r)ln(1+r)+(1−r)ln(1−r)−c1r2if|r| ≤1,
+∞ otherwise,(1.12)
Freg(r) :=1
4(r2−1)2, r∈R, (1.13)
with the convention that 0ln(0) := lim rց0rln(r) = 0 andc1>1 so thatFlogis noncon-
vex. Another important example is the nonregular and singular double obstacle potential ,
given by
F2obs(r) :=−c2r2if|r| ≤1 andF2obs(r) := +∞if|r|>1,(1.14)
withc2>0. However, the double obstacle case is not included in the subseque nt analysis,
although we expect that, with similar techniques as those employed in [10], it is possible
to extend the analysis also to this kind of nonregular potentials.
The state system (1.1)–(1.5) was recently in [11] analyzed concern ing well-posedness
andregularity(seetheresultscitedbelowinSection2),wherealsot hedoubleobstaclecase
was included. Here, we concentrate on the optimal control proble m. While the existence
of optimal controls is not too diﬃcult to show, the derivation of ﬁrst -order necessary
optimality conditions is a much more challenging task, since it makes the derivation of
diﬀerentiability properties of the associated control-to-state op erator necessary. This,
however, requires that the order parameter ϕsatisﬁes the so-called strict separation
property, which means that ϕattains its values in a compact subset of the interior of the
eﬀective domain of the derivative F′ofF. While for regular potentials this condition
turns out to be generally satisﬁed, it cannot be guaranteed for sin gular potentials. In
fact, following the ideas of the recent paper [9] on the isothermal c ase, one is just able
to ensure the validity of the strict separation property for the log arithmic potential Flog
in the two-dimensional case d= 2. Correspondingly, the analysis leading to ﬁrst-order
necessary optimality conditions will be restricted to either the regu lar case for d≤3
or the logarithmic case in two dimensions of space. In this sense, our results apply to
similar cases as those studied in [9] in the isothermal situation. Obser ve, however, that
the control problem considered in [9] diﬀers considerably from tha t studied in this paper:
indeed, in [9] the control uoccurs in the order parameter equation resembling (1.1), while
in our case it appears in the energy balance (1.3); for this reason, t he set of admissible
controlsUadhad to be assumed in [9] as a subset of the space H1(0,T;L2(Ω))∩L∞(Q),
which is cumbersome from the viewpoint of optimal control, instead o f the much better
spaceL∞(Q) used here.
The plan of the paper is as follows. The next section is devoted to colle ct previous
results concerning thewell-posedness ofthestatesystem (1.1)– (1.5). Then, under suitable
conditions, we provide some stronger analytic results in terms of re gularity and stability
properties of the state system with respect to the control varia bleuappearing in (1.3).Optimal Control of a nonisothermal Cahn–Hilliard type model 5
The proof of these new results are addressed in Section 3. Then, u sing these results, we
analyze in Section 4 the optimal control problem (P).
2 Notation, assumptions and analytic results
First, let us set some notation and general assumptions. For any B anach space X, we
employ the notation /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblX,X∗, and/an}b∇acketle{t·,·/an}b∇acket∇i}htX, to indicate the corresponding norm, its dual
space, and the related duality pairing between X∗andX. For two Banach spaces X
andYcontinuously embedded in some topological vector space Z, we introduce the
linear space X∩Y, which becomes a Banach space when equipped with its natural norm
/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblX∩Y:=/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblX+/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblY, forv∈X∩Y.
A special notation is used for the standard Lebesgue and Sobolev s paces deﬁned on Ω.
For every 1 ≤p≤ ∞andk≥0, they are denoted by Lp(Ω) andWk,p(Ω), with the asso-
ciated norms /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblLp(Ω)=/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblpand/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblWk,p(Ω), respectively. If p= 2, they become Hilbert
spaces, and we employ the standard convention Hk(Ω) :=Wk,2(Ω). For convenience, we
also set
H:=L2(Ω), V:=H1(Ω), W:={v∈H2(Ω) :∂nv= 0 on Γ }.
For simplicity, we use the symbol /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblfor the norm in Hand in any power of it. Observe
that the embeddings W ֒→V ֒→H ֒→V∗֒→W∗are dense and compact. As usual, His
identiﬁed with a subspace of V∗to have the Hilbert triplet ( V,H,V∗) along with identity
/an}b∇acketle{tu,v/an}b∇acket∇i}ht= (u,v) for every u∈Handv∈V,
where we employ the special notation /an}b∇acketle{t·,·/an}b∇acket∇i}ht:=/an}b∇acketle{t·,·/an}b∇acket∇i}htV.
Next, for a generic element v∈V∗, we deﬁne its generalized mean value vby
v:=1
|Ω|/an}b∇acketle{tv,1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht, (2.1)
where1stands for the constant function that takes the value 1 in Ω. It is c lear thatv
reduces to the usual mean value if v∈H. The same notation vis employed also if vis a
time-dependent function.
To conclude, for normed spaces Xandv∈L1(0,T;X), we deﬁne the convolution
products
(1∗v)(t) :=/integraldisplayt
0v(s)ds,(1⊛v)(t) :=/integraldisplayT
tv(s)ds, t∈[0,T]. (2.2)
For the remainder of this paper, we make the following general assu mptions.
(A1)The structural constants γ,a,b,κ1,κ2, andλare positive.
(A2)The double-well potential Fcan be written as F=/hatwideβ+/hatwideπ, where
/hatwideβ:R→[0,+∞] is convex and lower semicontinuous with /hatwideβ(0) = 0.6 Colli – Gilardi – Signori – Sprekels
This entails that β:=∂/hatwideβis a maximal monotone graph with β(0)∋0. Moreover,
we assume that
/hatwideπ∈C3(R), whereπ:=/hatwideπ′:R→Ris a Lipschitz continuous function.
Besides, denoting the eﬀective domain of βbyD(β), we assume that D(β) =
(r−,r+) with−∞ ≤r−<0<r+≤+∞and that the restriction of /hatwideβto (r−,r+)
belongs to C3(r−,r+). There,βreduces to the derivative of /hatwideβ, and we require that
lim
rցr−β(r) =−∞and lim
rրr+β(r) = +∞.
Please note that F′in (1.2) has to be understood as β+π.
(A3)Letf∈L∞(Q). We setρ:=/bardblf/bardbl∞
γand assume the compatibility condition that all
of the quantities
inf
x∈Ωϕ0(x),sup
x∈Ωϕ0(x),−ρ−(ϕ0)−, ρ+(ϕ0)+belong to the interior of D(β),
where (·)+and (·)−denote the positive and negative part functions, respectively.
The analysis of the above system (1.1)–(1.5) has been the subject of investigation
in [11]. There, weak and strong well-posedness has been addressed for general potentials
and source terms. Since here we aim at solving the optimal control p roblem(P), we are
forced to work under the framework of strong solutions. This, in p articular, forces us
to restrict the investigation to diﬀerentiable potentials, more prec isely, to either regular
ones like (1.13) or, under the further restriction that d= 2, to the logarithmic potential
from (1.12). Since we are going to assume (A1)–(A3)in any case, we state the following
results under these assumptions, even if some of the conditions ma y be relaxed (cf. [11]).
As a consequence of [11, Thms. 2.2, 2.3, and 2.5], we have the following well-posedness
result for the initial-boundary value problem (1.1)–(1.5).
Theorem 2.1 (Well-posedness of the state system) .Suppose that (A1)–(A3)hold true,
and let the data of the system fulﬁll
f∈H1(0,T;V∗), u∈L2(0,T;H), (2.3)
ϕ0∈H3(Ω)∩W, w 0∈V, w 1∈V. (2.4)
Then, there exists a unique solution (ϕ,µ,w)to the system (1.1)–(1.5)satisfying
ϕ∈H1(0,T;V)∩L∞(0,T;W2,6(Ω))withβ(ϕ)∈L∞(0,T;L6(Ω)),(2.5)
µ∈L∞(0,T;V), (2.6)
w∈H2(0,T;H)∩C1([0,T];V), (2.7)
as well as the estimate
/ba∇dblϕ/ba∇dblH1(0,T;V)∩L∞(0,T;W2,6(Ω))+/ba∇dblµ/ba∇dblL∞(0,T;V)+/ba∇dblβ(ϕ)/ba∇dblL∞(0,T;L6(Ω))
+/ba∇dblw/ba∇dblH2(0,T;H)∩C1([0,T];V)≤K1, (2.8)Optimal Control of a nonisothermal Cahn–Hilliard type model 7
with some constant K1>0that depends only on the structure of the system, Ω,T, and
upper bounds for the norms of the data and the quantities rela ted to assumptions (2.3)–
(2.4). Besides, let ui∈L2(0,T;H),i= 1,2, and let (ϕi,µi,wi)be the corresponding
solutions. Then it holds that
/ba∇dblϕ1−ϕ2/ba∇dblL∞(0,T;V∗)∩L2(0,T;V)+/ba∇dblw1−w2/ba∇dblH1(0,T;H)∩L∞(0,T;V)
≤K2/ba∇dbl1∗(u1−u2)/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H), (2.9)
with someK2>0that depends only on the structure of the system, Ω,T, and an upper
bound for the norms of β(ϕ1)andβ(ϕ2)inL1(Q).
Let us remark that, due to (2.5), the compact embedding W2,6(Ω)֒→C0(Ω), and
classical compactness results (see, e.g., [29, Sect. 8, Cor. 4]), it f ollows that ϕ∈C0(Q).
Remark 2.2. Theabovewell-posedness result referstothenaturalvariationa lformofthe
homogeneous Neumann problemforequation (1.1), duetothe lowre gularityofµspeciﬁed
in (2.6). However, it is clear that, thanks to (2.5), (A3)and the elliptic regularity theory,
we also have that µ∈L2(0,T;W), so that we actually can write (1.1) in its strong form.
A similar consideration can be repeated for the linear combination κ1∂tw+κ2win (1.3)
as you can ﬁnd in the remark below.
Remark 2.3. We point out that the regularity C1([0,T];V) for the variable wstated
in (2.7) does not directly follow from [11, Thms. 2.2, 2.3, 2.5], where jus t the regular-
ityW1,∞(0,T;V) was noticed. This, however, can be deduced with the help of (1.3),
rewritten as the parabolic equation
1
κ1∂ty−∆y=fw,withy:=κ1∂tw+κ2wandfw:=u−λ∂tϕ+κ2
κ1∂tw, (2.10)
where, due to the previous results, it readily follows that fw∈L2(0,T;H). Note that y
satisﬁes (2.10) along with the Neumann homogeneous boundary con dition in (1.4), and
the initial condition (cf. (1.5))
y(0) = (κ1∂tw+κ2w)(0) =κ1w1+κ2w0∈V.
Then, bya straightforwardapplicationofthe parabolicregularity t heory(see, e.g., [1,22]),
it turns out that
y=κ1∂tw+κ2w∈H1(0,T;H)∩C0([0,T];V)∩L2(0,T;W).
At this point, it is not diﬃcult to check that w∈C1([0,T];V), whereas we cannot infer
the regularity w∈H1(0,T;W) unless when w(0) =w0∈W.
As will be clear in the forthcoming Section 4, the analytic framework e ncapsulated in
Theorem2.1doesnotsuﬃcetorigorouslyprovetheFr´ echetdiﬀer entiabilityofthesolution
operator associated with the system (1.1)–(1.5) (cf. Theorem 4.4 further on) which is a
key point to formulate the ﬁrst-order necessary conditions for o ptimality addressed in
Section 4.3. For this reason, before entering the study of the opt imal control problem (P),
we present some reﬁned analytic results which are now possible by vir tue of the more8 Colli – Gilardi – Signori – Sprekels
restricting condition we are assuming on the potentials. In particula r, a key regularity
property to include singular and regular potentials in the analysis of t he optimal control
problem is the so-called strict separation property for the order parameter ϕ. This means
that the values of ϕare always conﬁned in a compact subset of the interior of D(β).
Notice that, if D(β) =R, then the boundedness of ϕthat follows from the previous
theorem already guarantees this property. For singular potentia ls, whenD(β) is an open
interval, that means that the singularities of the potential at the e nd-points of D(β) are
not reached by ϕat any time, meaning that the potential and its derivative actually ar e
globally Lipschitz continuous functions. The proof of the following re sult, sketched in
Section 3, is derived with minor modiﬁcations arguing as done in [9, Prop . 2.6]. It ensures
bothmore regularity for the solutionand the desired separation pr operty in the important
case of the logarithmic potential (1.12) in two dimensions.
Theorem 2.4 (Regularity and separation principle) .Suppose that (A1)–(A3)hold, let
d= 2, andFbe the logarithmic potential deﬁned in (1.12). Moreover, in addition to
(2.3)–(2.4), letfand the auxiliary datum µ0fulﬁll
f∈H1(0,T;H), µ0:=−∆ϕ0+F′(ϕ0)+a−bw1∈W. (2.11)
Then, the unique solution (ϕ,µ,w)obtained from Theorem 2.1 additionally enjoys the
regularity properties
∂tϕ∈L∞(0,T;H)∩L2(0,T;W), µ∈L∞(Q), β(ϕ)∈L∞(Q), (2.12)
as well as
/ba∇dbl∂tϕ/ba∇dblL∞(0,T;H)∩L2(0,T;W)+/ba∇dblµ/ba∇dblL∞(Q)+/ba∇dblβ(ϕ)/ba∇dblL∞(Q)≤K4,
for someK4>0that depends only on the structure of the system, the initial data,Ω,
andT. Furthermore, assume that
r−<min
x∈Ωϕ0(x)≤max
x∈Ωϕ0(x)<r+.
Then, the order parameter ϕenjoys the strict separation property, that is, there exist real
numbersr∗andr∗depending only on the structure of the system such that
r−<r∗≤ϕ(x,t)≤r∗<r+fora.e.(x,t)∈Q.
Remark 2.5. We point out that the regularity for µin (2.12) is a consequence of the
regularityµ∈L∞(0,T;W) and of the Sobolev embedding W ֒→L∞(Ω), which holds
up to the three-dimensional case. Notice also that a class of poten tials slightly more
general than the logarithmic one in (1.12) may be possibly considered : for this aim we
refer to [18, Thm. 5.1], where a strict separation property has bee n derived in a suitable
framework.
As a straightforward consequence of the above results, we have the following.
Corollary 2.6. Suppose that either D(β) =Ror that the assumptions of Theorem 2.4
are fulﬁlled. Then, there exists a positive constant K5just depending on the structure and
an upper bound for the norms of the data of the system such that
/ba∇dblϕ/ba∇dblL∞(Q)+ max
i=0,1,2,3/ba∇dblF(i)(ϕ)/ba∇dblL∞(Q)≤K5. (2.13)Optimal Control of a nonisothermal Cahn–Hilliard type model 9
With the above regularity improvement, we are now in a position to obt ain a stronger
continuous dependence estimate concerning the controls.
Theorem 2.7 (Reﬁned continuous dependence result) .Suppose that (A1)–(A3)hold.
Moreover, assume that the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the potentialFare Lipschitz
continuous. Consider ui∈L2(0,T;H),i= 1,2, and let (ϕi,µi,wi),i= 1,2, be the
corresponding solutions. Then, it holds that
/ba∇dblϕ1−ϕ2/ba∇dblH1(0,T;V∗)∩L∞(0,T;V)∩L2(0,T;W)+/ba∇dblµ1−µ2/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V)

with someK6>0that depends only on the structure of the system, Ω, andT.
Notice that the above result holds for regular potentials both in dime nsions two and
three, as for these the Lipschitz continuity of F′follows as a consequence of Theorem 2.1.
On the other hand, the logarithmic potential can be considered jus t in dimension two
as a consequence of the separation principle established by Theore m 2.4. It is worth
pointing out that the regularity improvement obtained in Theorem 2.4 does not require
more regularity of the control variable u. In particular, the strong well-posedness for the
system is guaranteed for any control u∈L2(0,T;H) (in which the control space Uis
embedded, see (1.7)).
Let us conclude this section by collecting some useful tools that will b e employed later
on. We often owe to the Young, Poincar´ e and compactness inequa lities:

N: dom(N) :={ψ∈V∗:ψ= 0} → {z∈V:z= 0},N:ψ/mapsto→z, (2.19)
wherezis the unique solution to (2.18) satisfying z= 0. Moreover, it follows that the
formula

the above properties, one can obtain the following identities:

Finally, without further reference later on, we are going to employ t he following con-
vention: the capital-case symbol Cis used to denote every constant that depends only
on the structural data of the problem such as Ω, T,a,b,κ1,κ2,γ,λ, the shape of the
nonlinearities, and the norms of the involved functions. Therefore , its meaning may vary
from line to line and even within the same line. In addition, when a positive constantδ
enters the computation, the related symbol Cδ, in place of a general C, denotes constants
that depend on δ, in addition.
3 Regularity and continuous dependence results
This section is devoted to the proofs of Theorem 2.4 and Theorem 2.7 . The ﬁrst result
is propedeutic to the second one which will play a key role in proving tha t the solution
operator associated with the system enjoys some diﬀerentiability p roperties.
Proof of Theorem 2.4. We can follow exactly the same argument as that used in [9,
Sect. 5.2] to prove the analogous result [9, Prop. 2.6]. However, alt hough we should per-
form the estimates in a rigorous way on a suitable discrete scheme de signed on a proper
approximating problem as done in the quoted paper, we proceed for mally, for simplicity,
by directly acting on problem (1.1)–(1.5), and point out the few diﬀer ences arising from
the presence of the additional variable w. We diﬀerentiate both (1.1) and (1.2) with re-
spect to time and test the resulting inequalities by ∂tϕand ∆∂tϕ, respectively. If we sum
up and integrate by parts and over (0 ,t), then a cancellation occurs, and we obtain that

This is the analogue of [9, formula (5.16)] and essentially diﬀers from it just for the
presence of the last term. However, this term can be easily dealt wit h by using Young’s
inequality and the regularity of wensured by (2.7). Indeed, we have that

As the other terms can be treated as in the quoted paper, we arriv e at the analogue
of [9, formula (5.17)], i.e.,
/ba∇dbl∂tϕ/ba∇dbl2

Atthispoint,thenewvariable wjustentersthecomputationof ∂tϕ(0). Bystillproceeding
formally, we recover the initial value for µ(0) =µ0from (1.2) at the time t= 0, then,
using the regularity of µ0(andf) stated in (2.11), we ﬁnd out that
∂tϕ(0) =f(0)+∆µ0−γϕ0∈H
from (1.1), also written for t= 0. Then, we obtain that
/ba∇dbl∂tϕ(0)/ba∇dbl2≤ /ba∇dblf(0)+∆µ0−γϕ0/ba∇dbl2≤C.
At this point, wdoes not enter the argument any longer, and we can proceed and t hen
conclude exactly as in [9].
Proof of Theorem 2.7. To begin with, let us set the following notation for the diﬀerences
involved in the statement:
ϕ:=ϕ1−ϕ2, µ:=µ1−µ2, u:=u1−u2, w:=w1−w2.
Next, we write the system solved by the diﬀerences that, in its stro ng form, reads as
∂tϕ−∆µ+γϕ= 0 in Q, (3.1)
µ=−∆ϕ+(F′(ϕ1)−F′(ϕ2))−b∂twinQ, (3.2)
∂2
tw−∆(κ1∂tw+κ2w)+λ∂tϕ=uinQ, (3.3)
∂nϕ=∂nµ=∂n(κ1∂tw+κ2w) = 0 on Σ , (3.4)
ϕ(0) =w(0) =∂tw(0) = 0 in Ω . (3.5)
First estimate. First, we recall that F′is now assumed to be Lipschitz continuous.
Then, testing (3.1) by ϕ, (3.2) byµ, and adding the resulting equations lead us to
1

2/ba∇dblµ/ba∇dbl2+C/parenleftbig
/ba∇dblϕ/ba∇dbl2+/ba∇dbl∂tw/ba∇dbl2/parenrightbig
.
Now, recalling the continuous dependence estimate already proved in Theorem 2.1, we
infer, after integrating over time, that
/ba∇dblϕ1−ϕ2/ba∇dblL∞(0,T;H)+/ba∇dblµ1−µ2/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H)≤C/ba∇dbl1∗(u1−u2)/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H).(3.6)12 Colli – Gilardi – Signori – Sprekels
Second estimate. First, let us establish an auxiliary estimate. Since F′andF′′are
supposed to be Lipschitz continuous and (2.8) ensures a uniform bo und for/ba∇dbl∇ϕ2/ba∇dbl∞, we
have, almost everywhere in (0 ,T), that
/ba∇dblF′(ϕ1)−F′(ϕ2)/ba∇dblV≤ /ba∇dblF′(ϕ1)−F′(ϕ2)/ba∇dbl+/ba∇dblF′′(ϕ1)∇ϕ1−F′′(ϕ2)∇ϕ2/ba∇dbl

≤C/ba∇dblϕ/ba∇dbl+C/ba∇dbl∇ϕ/ba∇dbl ≤C/ba∇dblϕ/ba∇dblV.
Next, we multiply (3.1) by 1 /|Ω|to obtain that
d
dtϕ(t)+γϕ(t) = 0 for a.a. t∈(0,T), (3.7)
which entails that ϕ(t) = 0 for every t∈[0,T] sinceϕ(0) = 0. In particular, besides ϕ,
even∂tϕhas zero mean value. Thus, we are allowed to test (3.1) by N(∂tϕ), (3.2) by
−∂tϕ, and (3.3) byb
λ∂tw, and add the resulting identities. By also accounting for the
Lipschitz continuity of F′and the Young inequality, we deduce that, a.e. in (0 ,T),
/ba∇dbl∂tϕ/ba∇dbl2

Hence, integrating over time and using (2.9), we may conclude that
/ba∇dblϕ1−ϕ2/ba∇dblH1(0,T;V∗)∩L∞(0,T;V)+/ba∇dblw1−w2/ba∇dblW1,∞(0,T;H)∩H1(0,T;V)
≤C/ba∇dblu1−u2/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H). (3.8)
Third estimate. By testing (3.1) by µ, we have that
/integraldisplay
Ω∂tϕµ+/integraldisplay
Ω|∇µ|2+γ/integraldisplay
Ωϕµ= 0.
Now, we recall that ϕand∂tϕhave zero mean value. Hence, by also accounting for the
Poincar´ e inequality (2.16), we deduce that
/integraldisplay
Ω|∇µ|2=−/integraldisplay

.
Therefore, thanks to (3.6) and (3.8), it readily follows that
/ba∇dblµ1−µ2/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V)≤C/ba∇dblu1−u2/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H). (3.9)
Fourth estimate. A simple comparison argument in (3.2), along with the above esti-
mates and elliptic regularity theory, entails that
/ba∇dblϕ1−ϕ2/ba∇dblL2(0,T;W)≤C/ba∇dblu1−u2/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H). (3.10)Optimal Control of a nonisothermal Cahn–Hilliard type model 13
Fifth estimate. Wetakeanarbitrary v∈L2(0,T;V),multiply (3.3)by v,andintegrate
overQand by parts. By rearranging and estimating, we easily obtain that
/integraldisplay
Q∂2
twv≤C/parenleftbig
/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H)+/ba∇dbl∂tw/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V)+/ba∇dblw/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V)+/ba∇dbl∂tϕ/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V∗)/parenrightbig
/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V).
On account of the previous estimates, we conclude that
/ba∇dbl∂2
tw1−∂2
tw2/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V∗)≤C/ba∇dblu1−u2/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H). (3.11)
Sixth estimate. Arguing as in Remark 2.3, we now rewrite (3.3) as a parabolic
equation in the auxiliary variable y:=κ1∂tw+κ2w+κ1λϕobtaining that
1
κ1∂ty−∆y=u+κ2
κ1∂tw−κ1λ∆ϕ.
Besides, let us underline that ysatisﬁes homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and
null initial conditions, as it can be realized from (3.4) and (3.5). Then, using a well-
known parabolic regularity result and the already found estimates ( 3.8) and (3.10), it is
straightforward to deduce that
/ba∇dbly/ba∇dblH1(0,T;H)∩C0([0,T];V)∩L2(0,T;W)≤C/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleu+κ2
κ1∂tw−κ1λ∆ϕ/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
L2(0,T;H)≤C/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H).
Thus, by solving the Cauchy problem for the ordinary diﬀerential eq uationκ1∂tw+κ2w=
y−κ1λϕin terms of w, and recalling again (3.8) and (3.10), we ﬁnd out that
/ba∇dblw1−w2/ba∇dblH2(0,T;V∗)∩W1,∞(0,T;V)∩H1(0,T;W)≤C/ba∇dblu1−u2/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H).(3.12)
This completes the proof, as collecting the above estimates yields (2 .14).
4 The optimal control problem
In this section, we study the optimal control problem introduced a t the beginning, which
we recall here for the reader’s convenience:
(P)min
u∈UadJ((ϕ,w),u) subject to the constraint that ( ϕ,µ,w) solves (1.1)–(1.5),
where the cost functional Jis given by (1.6).
To begin with, let us ﬁx some notation concerning the solution operat orSassociated
with the system (1.1)–(1.5). As a consequence of the Theorems 2.1 , 2.4, and 2.7, the
control-to-state operator
S= (S1,S2,S3) :L2(Q)(⊃U)→Y,S:u/mapsto→(ϕ,µ,w),
is well deﬁned, where ( ϕ,µ,w)∈Yis the unique solution to the state system, and the
Banach space Y, referred to as the state space , is deﬁned by the regularity speciﬁed in
(2.5)–(2.7) and partially in (2.12), that is,
Y:=/parenleftbig

×L∞(0,T;V)
×/parenleftbig
H2(0,T;H)∩C1([0,T];V)/parenrightbig
.14 Colli – Gilardi – Signori – Sprekels
Moreover, the continuous dependence estimate provided by Theo rem 2.7 allows us to infer
that the solution operator is Lipschitz continuous in the sense that , for any pair ( u1,u2)
of controls, it holds that
/ba∇dblS(u1)−S(u2)/ba∇dblX≤K6/ba∇dblu1−u2/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H),
whereXis the space deﬁned by
X:=/parenleftbig

×/parenleftbig
H2(0,T;V∗)∩W1,∞(0,T;V)∩H1(0,T;W)). (4.1)
Furthermore, we introduce the reduced cost functional , given by
Jred:L2(Q)⊂U→R,Jred:u/mapsto→J(S1(u),S3(u),u), (4.2)
which allows us to reduce the optimization problem (P)to the form
min
u∈UadJred(u).
In what follows, we are working in the framework of Theorem 2.1 (and possibly in the
sense of Theorem 2.4). For this reason, the following conditions will b e in order:
(C1)Thesource ffulﬁlls(2.3), andtheinitialdata ϕ0,w0,andw1satisfy(2.4). Moreover,
if we consider the logarithmic potential and d= 2, they additionally fulﬁll (2.11).
(C2)The functions umin,umaxbelong to Uwithumin≤umaxa.e. inQ.
(C3)α1,...,α 6,andνare nonnegative constants, not all zero.
(C4)The target functions fulﬁll ϕQ,wQ,w′
Q∈L2(Q),ϕΩ∈V,wΩ∈H, andw′
Ω∈V.
4.1 Existence of optimal controls
The ﬁrst result we are going to address concerns the existence of optimal controls.
Theorem 4.1 (Existence of optimal controls) .We suppose that the assumptions (A1)–
(A3)and(C1)–(C4)are fulﬁlled. Then, the optimal control problem (P)admits a
solution.
Proof of Theorem 4.1. As the proof is an immediate consequence of the direct method of
the calculus of variations, we just brieﬂy outline the crucial steps. Consider a minimizing
sequence {un}n⊂Uadfor the reduced cost functional Jreddeﬁned by (4.2). Let us
introduce also the sequence of the associated states {(ϕn,µn,wn)}n, where (ϕn,µn,wn) =
S(un) for every n∈N. Namely, we have that
lim
n→∞Jred(un) = lim
n→∞J/parenleftbig
(S1(un),S3(un)),un/parenrightbig
= inf
u∈UadJred(u)≥0.Optimal Control of a nonisothermal Cahn–Hilliard type model 15
Thus, as Uadis bounded in U, by standard compactness arguments, using also that Uadis
closed and convex, we obtain a limit function u∗∈Uadand a nonrelabelled subsequence
such that, as n→ ∞,
un→u∗weakly-star in L∞(Q).
On the other hand, by the boundedness property (2.8) stated in T heorem 2.1, along with
standard compactness results (see, e.g., [29, Sect. 8, Cor. 4]), w e also have that
ϕn→ϕ∗weakly-star in H1(0,T;V)∩L∞(0,T;W2,6(Ω)),
and strongly in C0(Q),
µn→µ∗weakly-star in L∞(0,T;V),
wn→w∗weakly-star in H2(0,T;H)∩W1,∞(0,T;V),
and strongly in C1([0,T];H),
F′(ϕn)→ξ∗weakly-star in L∞(0,T;L6(Ω)),
for some limits ϕ∗,µ∗,w∗, andξ∗. The ﬁrst strong convergence follows from the compact
embedding W2,6(Ω)֒→C0(Ω). Besides, as
π(ϕn)→π(ϕ∗) strongly in C0(Q) andβ(ϕn)→ξ∗−π(ϕ∗) weakly in L1(Q),
bymaximal monotonicity argumentsitisnotdiﬃcult toconclude that ξ∗=F′(ϕ∗). Then,
usingtheaboveweak, weak-star andstrongconvergence prope rties, itisastandardmatter
to pass to the limit as ntends to inﬁnity in the variational formulation associated with
system (1.1)–(1.5), written for ϕn,µn,wn,andun. This will also prove that ( ϕ∗,µ∗,w∗) is
nothing but S(u∗). Finally, the lower semicontinuity of norms entails that
Jred(u∗)≤liminf
n→∞Jred(un) = lim
n→∞Jred(un) = inf
u∈UadJred(u),
meaning that u∗is a global minimizer for Jred.
4.2 Diﬀerentiability of the solution operator
In the following, we are going to prove some diﬀerentiability propertie s for the solution
operator S. Since these have to be analyzed in open sets, let us take an open ba ll in the
L∞-topology that contains the set of admissible controls Uad,namely, let R>0 be chosen
such that
UR:={u∈U:/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblU<R} ⊃Uad.
Now, we ﬁx u∈URand denote by ( ϕ,µ,w) =S(u) the unique corresponding state. Then,
the linearized system to (1.1)–(1.5) at the ﬁxed control uis given, for any h∈L2(Q), as
follows:
∂tξ−∆η+γξ= 0 in Q, (4.3)
η=−∆ξ+F′′(ϕ)ξ−b∂tζ inQ, (4.4)
∂2
tζ−∆(κ1∂tζ+κ2ζ)+λ∂tξ=hinQ, (4.5)
∂nξ=∂nη=∂n(κ1∂tζ+κ2ζ) = 0 on Σ , (4.6)
ξ(0) =ζ(0) =∂tζ(0) = 0 in Ω . (4.7)16 Colli – Gilardi – Signori – Sprekels
The proof of the well-posedness of the above system is very similar ( and, in fact, easier,
as the system is linear) to the proof of Theorem 2.1. We have the follo wing result.
Theorem 4.2 (Well-posedness of the linearized system) .Assume that (A1)–(A3)and
(C1)hold, and let u∈URwith associated state (ϕ,µ,w) =S(u)be given. Then, for
everyh∈L2(Q), the linearized system (4.3)–(4.7)admits a unique solution (ξ,η,ζ)∈X,
whereXis the Banach space introduced by (4.1). Furthermore, there exists some K7>0,
which depends only on the structure of the system and an upper bound for the norm of f
and those of the initial data, such that
/ba∇dblξ/ba∇dblH1(0,T;V∗)∩L∞(0,T;V)∩L2(0,T;W)+/ba∇dblη/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V)
+/ba∇dblζ/ba∇dblH2(0,T;V∗)∩W1,∞(0,T;V)∩H1(0,T;W)≤K7/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H). (4.8)
Remark 4.3. Due to the low regularity level given by the deﬁnition (4.1) of X, the
above result must refer to a proper variational formulation of the linearized problem.
For instance, (4.3) with the homogeneous Neumann boundary cond ition forηhas to be
read as
/an}b∇acketle{t∂tξ,v/an}b∇acket∇i}ht+/integraldisplay
Ω∇η·∇v+γ/integraldisplay
Ωξv= 0 a.e. in (0 ,T), for every v∈V.
Proof of Theorem 4.2. As the system is linear, the uniqueness of solutions readily follows
once (4.8) has been shown for a special solution. Indeed, suppose that there are two
solutions (ξ1,η1,ζ1) and (ξ2,η2,ζ2).It is then enough to repeat the procedure used below
withξ=ξ1−ξ2,η=η1−η2andζ=ζ1−ζ2to realize that the same as (4.8) holds with
the right-hand side equal to 0 so that ( ξ1,η1,ζ1)≡(ξ2,η2,ζ2), i.e., the uniqueness.
Since the proof of existence is standard, we avoid introducing any a pproximation
scheme and just provide formal estimates. The rigorous argumen t can be straightfor-
wardly reproduced, e.g., on a suitable Faedo–Galerkin scheme.
First estimate. We aim at proving that
/ba∇dblξ/ba∇dblL∞(0,T;V)+/ba∇dblη/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V)+/ba∇dblζ/ba∇dblW1,∞(0,T;H)∩H1(0,T;V)≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H).(4.9)
We preliminarily observe that
/ba∇dbl∂tξ/ba∇dblL2(0,t;V∗)≤C/parenleftbig
/ba∇dblξ/ba∇dblL2(0,t;H)+/ba∇dblη/ba∇dblL2(0,t;V)/parenrightbig
for everyt∈(0,T], (4.10)
as one immediately sees by multiplying (4.3) by any v∈L2(0,t;V) and integrating over
Qtand by parts. Moreover, we recall (2.8) and (2.13) and observe th at the former yields
a uniformL∞bound for ∇ϕsinceW1,6(Ω)֒→L∞(Ω). It then follows that
/ba∇dblF′′(ϕ)ξ/ba∇dblV≤C/ba∇dblξ/ba∇dblVa.e. in (0,T). (4.11)
At this point, we are ready to perform the desired estimate. We tes t (4.3) byη+ξ, (4.4)
by−∂tξ+η, (4.5) byb
λ∂tζ, and add the resulting equalities to infer that a.e. in (0 ,T) it
holds

and it is clear that (4.9) follows upon integrating in time and invoking Gro nwall’s lemma
provided we can properly estimate the time integral of the last term . Using also (4.10)
and (4.11), we have that

and this is suﬃcient to conclude.
Second Estimate. We now readily deduce from (4.10) that
/ba∇dbl∂tξ/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V∗)≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H). (4.12)
On the other hand, by comparing the terms in (4.4) and taking advan tage of (4.9) and
(4.11), well-known elliptic regularity results allow us to infer that
/ba∇dblξ/ba∇dblL2(0,T;W)≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H). (4.13)
Third Estimate. Now, let us rewrite equation (4.5) in terms of the auxiliary variable
z:=κ1∂tζ+κ2ζ+κ1λξ. We obtain
1
κ1∂tz−∆z=h+κ2
κ1∂tζ−κ1λ∆ξ,
and observe that, in view of (4.6)–(4.7), zsatisﬁes Neumann homogeneous boundary
conditions and null initial conditions. Then, by known parabolic regula rity results, (4.9),
and (4.13), we easily deduce that
/ba∇dblz/ba∇dblH1(0,T;H)∩C0([0,T];V)∩L2(0,T;W)≤C/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleh+κ2
κ1∂tζ−κ1λ∆ξ/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
L2(0,T;H)≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H).
Hence, by recalling the deﬁnition of zand the already proved bounds (4.9), (4.12), and
(4.13), we arrive at
/ba∇dblζ/ba∇dblH2(0,T;V∗)∩W1,∞(0,T;V)∩H1(0,T;W)≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H). (4.14)
Due to the embeddings V∗֒→W∗andW ֒→H≡H∗֒→W∗, by interpolation we have
that
H2(0,T;V∗)∩H1(0,T;W)֒→C1([0,T];H),
whence (4.14) entails, in particular, that
/ba∇dblζ/ba∇dblC1([0,T];H)≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H). (4.15)
This concludes the sketch of the proof.18 Colli – Gilardi – Signori – Sprekels
We now expect that – provided we select the correct Banach space s – the linearized
system encapsulates thebehavior oftheFr´ echet derivative oft hesolutionoperator S. This
is stated rigorously in the next theorem, but prior to this, let us intr oduce the following
Banach space:
Z:=/parenleftbig
H1(0,T;W∗)∩C0([0,T];H)∩L2(0,T;W)/parenrightbig
×L2(0,T;H)
×/parenleftbig

. (4.16)
Theorem 4.4 (Fr´ echet diﬀerentiability of the solution operator) .Let the set of assump-
tions(A1)–(A3)and(C1)be fulﬁlled. Then, the control-to-state operator Sis Fr´ echet
diﬀerentiable at any u∈URas a mapping from L2(Q)intoZ. Moreover, for u∈UR,
the mapping DS(u)∈L(L2(Q),Z)acts as follows: for every h∈L2(Q),DS(u)his the
unique solution (ξ,η,ζ)to the linearized system (4.3)–(4.7)associated with h.
Proof of Theorem 4.4. We ﬁxu∈URand ﬁrst notice that the map h/mapsto→(ξ,η,ζ) of the
statement actually belongs to L(L2(Q),Z) as a consequence of (4.8). Then, we proceed
with a direct check of the claim by showing that
/ba∇dblS(u+h)−S(u)−(ξ,η,ζ)/ba∇dblZ
/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(Q)→0 as/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(Q)→0. (4.17)
ThiswillimplyboththeFr´ echetdiﬀerentiabilityof Sinthesensespeciﬁedinthestatement
and the validity of the identity DS(u)h= (ξ,η,ζ).
At this place, we remark that the following argumentation will be form al, because of
the low regularity of the linearized variables (recall Remark 4.3). Nev ertheless, we adopt
it for brevity, in order to avoid any approximation, like a Faedo–Galer kin scheme based
on the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator with homogeneous N eumann boundary
conditions (in which case, e.g., the Laplacian of the components of th e discrete solution
could actually be used as test functions).
Withoutlossofgenerality, wemayassume that /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(Q)issmallenough. Inparticular,
we owe to the estimates proved for the solutions to the nonlinear pr oblem corresponding
to bothuandu+h. For convenience, let us set
ψ:=ϕh−ϕ−ξ, σ:=µh−µ−η, ω:=wh−w−ζ,
with (ϕh,µh,wh) :=S(u+h), (ϕ,µ,w) :=S(u), and where ( ξ,η,ζ) is the unique solution
to (4.3)–(4.7) associated with h. Due to the previous results, we already know that
(ψ,σ,ω)∈X֒→Zand that, by diﬀerence, it yields a weak solution to the system
∂tψ−∆σ+γψ= 0 in Q, (4.18)
σ=−∆ψ+[F′(ϕh)−F′(ϕ)−F′′(ϕ)ξ]−b∂tωinQ, (4.19)

∂nψ=∂nσ=∂n(κ1∂tω+κ2ω) = 0 on Σ , (4.21)
ψ(0) =ω(0) =∂tω(0) = 0 in Ω . (4.22)
Besides, with the above notation, (4.17) amounts show that
/ba∇dbl(ψ,σ,ω)/ba∇dblZ=o(/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(Q)) as/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblL2(Q)→0. (4.23)Optimal Control of a nonisothermal Cahn–Hilliard type model 19
Moreover, Theorems 2.1 and 2.7 entail that
/ba∇dblϕh/ba∇dblH1(0,T;V)∩L∞(0,T;W2,6(Ω))+/ba∇dblµh/ba∇dblL∞(0,T;V)+/ba∇dblwh/ba∇dblH2(0,T;H)∩W1,∞(0,T;V)≤K1,(4.24)
as well as

Actually, for the logarithmic potential in the two-dimensional settin g, we also have a
stronger version of (4.24) arising as a consequence of Theorem 2.4 .
Before entering the details, we recall that Taylor’s formula yields th at
F′(ϕh)−F′(ϕ)−F′′(ϕ)ξ=F′′(ϕ)ψ+Rh(ϕh−ϕ)2, (4.26)
where the remainder Rhis given by
Rh=/integraldisplay1

ϕ+s(ϕh−ϕ)/parenrightbig
(1−s)ds.
Due to (2.13), we have that
/ba∇dblRh/ba∇dblL∞(Q)≤C. (4.27)
First estimate. We notice that ψhas zero mean value as can be easily checked by
testing (4.18) by 1 /|Ω|and using (4.22). Hence, we can test (4.18) by Nψand (4.19)
by−ψ. Moreover, we integrate (4.20) in time and test the resulting equat ion byb
λ∂tω.
Finally, we sum up and add the same termκ1b

Since we aim at applying the Gronwall lemma, we should integrate over ( 0,t) with respect
to time. However, for brevity, we just estimate the ﬁrst two term s of the right-hand side
obtained by integration (the last one can be trivially handled by the Yo ung inequality)
andavoidwriting theintegrationvariable sintheintegrals over (0 ,t). Theﬁrst onecanbe
controlled by using the H¨ older and Young inequalities, (4.25), the co ntinuous embedding
V ֒→L4(Ω), (4.26), (4.27), and the compactness inequality (2.17) as follow s:

As for the second term, we integrate by parts both in space and tim e. By also accounting

Thus, we can apply the Gronwall lemma and conclude that

Second estimate. We test (4.18) by ψ, (4.19) by ∆ ψ, and add the resulting equalities
to ﬁnd that

As above, we only estimate the right-hand side of the equality obtain ed by integrating
over (0,t). By also accounting for the previous estimate, we have that

Thus, owing also to the elliptic regularity theory, we conclude that
/ba∇dblψ/ba∇dblL∞(0,T;H)∩L2(0,T;W)≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2
L2(Q). (4.29)
Third estimate. Next, we test (4.19) by σand, arguing as above, we obtain that
/ba∇dblσ/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H)≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2
L2(Q). (4.30)
Fourth estimate. We can now test (4.18) by an arbitrary function v∈L2(0,T;W)
and, in view of (4.29) and (4.30), easily infer that
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplayT

≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2
L2(Q)/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblL2(0,T;W)for allv∈L2(0,T;W).
Hence,/ba∇dbl∂tψ/ba∇dblL2(0,T;W∗)is uniformly bounded by a quantity proportional to /ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2
L2(Q), so
that from (4.29) and an interpolation argument we recover that
/ba∇dblψ/ba∇dblH1(0,T;W∗)∩C0([0,T];H)∩L2(0,T;W)≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2
L2(Q). (4.31)Optimal Control of a nonisothermal Cahn–Hilliard type model 21
Fifth estimate. Next, we rewrite equation (4.20) in terms of the auxiliary variable
τ:=κ1∂tω+κ2ω+κ1λψto obtain
1
κ1∂tτ−∆τ=κ2
κ1∂tω−κ1λ∆ψ.
Thanks to (4.21)–(4.22), it turns out that τsatisﬁes Neumann homogeneous boundary
conditions and null initial conditions. Then, by virtue of parabolicreg ularity results along
with (4.28) and (4.31), we have that
/ba∇dblτ/ba∇dblH1(0,T;H)∩C0([0,T];V)∩L2(0,T;W)≤C/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleκ2
κ1∂tω−κ1λ∆ψ/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
L2(0,T;H)≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2
L2(Q).
Therefore, observing that κ1∂tω+κ2ω=τ−κ1λψ, it follows that both ωand∂tωsatisfy
(at least) the same estimate as (4.31), which yields
/ba∇dblω/ba∇dblH2(0,T;W∗)∩C1([0,T];H)∩H1(0,T;W)≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2
L2(Q). (4.32)
This concludes the proof since the estimates (4.30)–(4.32) directly lead to (4.23).
4.3 Adjoint system and ﬁrst-order optimality conditions
As a ﬁnal step, we now introduce a suitable adjoint system to (1.1)– (1.5) in order to
recover a more practical form of the optimality conditions for (P). Letu∈Uadbe given
with its associated state( ϕ,µ,w). In a strong formulation, theadjoint system is expressed
by thebackward-in-time parabolic system
−∂tp−∆q+γp+F′′(ϕ)q−λ∂tr=α1(ϕ−ϕQ) in Q,(4.33)
q=−∆p inQ,(4.34)

p(T) =α2(ϕ(T)−ϕΩ)−λα6(∂tw(T)−w′
Ω), r(T) =α6(∂tw(T)−w′
Ω) in Ω,(4.37)
where the convolution product ⊛has been introduced in (2.2). Concerning this product,
note in particular that ∂t(1⊛r) =−r.Let us introduce the following shorthand for the
right-hand side of (4.35),
fr:=α3(1⊛(w−wQ))+α4(w(T)−wΩ)+α5(∂tw−w′
Q).
We also notice that the second term is independent of time. Due to th e regularity prop-
erties in (2.7) and (C4), it holds that
/ba∇dblfr/ba∇dblL2(0,T;H)≤C(/ba∇dblw/ba∇dblH2(0,T;H)∩W1,∞(0,T;V)+1)≤C. (4.38)
Let us remark that the variable rcorresponds to the adjoint of the freezing index w.
Besides, equation (4.35) is of ﬁrst-order in time instead of second- order. However, it is
worth pointing out that (4.35) may be rewritten in the time-integrat ed variable 1 ⊛ras
it holds that −∂tr=∂2
t(1⊛r).22 Colli – Gilardi – Signori – Sprekels
Theorem 4.5 (Well-posedness of the adjoint system) .Let the assumptions (A1)–(A3)
and(C1)–(C4)hold, and let u∈Uadwith associated state (ϕ,µ,w)=S(u)be given.
Then, the adjoint system (4.33)–(4.37)admits a unique weak solution (p,q,r)such that
p∈H1(0,T;V∗)∩L∞(0,T;V)∩L2(0,T;W),
q∈L2(0,T;V),
r∈H1(0,T;H)∩L∞(0,T;V).
Remark 4.6. Similarly as in Remark 4.3, we should here speak of a proper variational
formulation. For instance, (4.33) with the homogeneous Neumann b oundary condition

Proof of Theorem 4.5. Again, for existence, we proceed formally but let us underline that
the following computations can however be reproduced in a rigorous framework.
First estimate. We test (4.33) by p+q, (4.34) by ∂tp+ (K5+ 1)q, whereK5is the
positive constant arising from (2.13), (4.35) by −λ

/ba∇dblq/ba∇dbl2+C/ba∇dblp/ba∇dbl2,
and the ﬁrst term appearing on the right can be absorbed by the co rresponding contribu-

terms on the right-hand side are bounded above by

thanks to (2.8) and the estimate (4.38) of fr. Next, we integrate over ( t,T), for any

their explicit form given by (4.37). Moreover, we treat the integral deriving from the last

have that

Thus, from the (backward) Gronwall lemma and the obvious subseq uent inequality
/ba∇dblr(t)/ba∇dbl ≤C/ba∇dbl∂tr/ba∇dblL2(Q)+Cfor everyt∈[0,T],
we infer that
/ba∇dblp/ba∇dblL∞(0,T;V)+/ba∇dblq/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V)+/ba∇dblr/ba∇dblH1(0,T;H)∩L∞(0,T;V)≤C.
Second estimate. Elliptic regularity theory applied to (4.34) then produces
/ba∇dblp/ba∇dblL2(0,T;W)≤C.
Third estimate. Finally, it is a standard matter to infer from a comparison argument
in (4.33), along with the above estimates, that
/ba∇dbl∂tp/ba∇dblL2(0,T;V∗)≤C.
This concludes the (formal) proof of the existence of a solution. By performing the same
estimates in the case of vanishing right-hand side and ﬁnal data, we see that the solution
must vanish, whence uniqueness in the general case follows by linear ity.
Finally, using the adjoint variables, we present the ﬁrst-order nec essary conditions
for an optimal control u∗solving(P). In the following, ( p,q,r) and (ξ,η,ζ) denote the
solutions of the respective adjoint problem and linearized problem, b ut written in terms
of the associated state ( ϕ∗,µ∗,w∗) =S(u∗) that replaces ( ϕ,µ,w) in systems (4.3)–(4.7)
and (4.33)–(4.37).
Theorem 4.7 (First-order optimality conditions) .Suppose that (A1)–(A3)and(C1)–
(C4)hold. Letu∗be an optimal control for (P)with associated state (ϕ∗,µ∗,w∗) =S(u∗)
and adjoint (p,q,r). Then, it necessarily fulﬁlls the variational inequality
/integraldisplay
Q(r+νu∗)(u−u∗)≥0for everyu∈Uad. (4.40)24 Colli – Gilardi – Signori – Sprekels

optimality condition for every optimal control u∗of(P)is expressed in the abstract
form as

Theorem 4.4, and the form of the cost functional Jin (1.6), this entails that any optimal

formulation is not very useful in numerical applications as it depends on the linearized
variables. However, with the help of the adjoint variables, playing th e role of Lagrangian
multipliers, the above variational inequality can be simpliﬁed. In this dir ection, we test
(4.3) byp, (4.4) byq, (4.5) byr, and add the resulting equalities and integrate over
time and by parts. More precisely, we should consider the variationa l formulations of
the linearized and adjoint systems mentioned in Remarks 4.3 and 4.6 in o rder to avoid
writing some Laplacian that does not exist in the usual sense, and we should also owe
to (well-known) generalized versions of the integration by parts in t ime. However, for

Corollary 4.8. Suppose the assumptions of Theorem 4.7 are fulﬁlled, and let u∗be an
optimal control with associated state (ϕ∗,µ∗,w∗) =S(u∗)and adjoint (p,q,r). Then,
wheneverν >0,u∗is theL2-orthogonal projection of −1
νrontoUad. Besides, we have
the pointwise characterization of the optimal control u∗as
u∗(x,t) = max/braceleftBig
umin(x,t),min{umax(x,t),−1
νr(x,t)}/bracerightBig
