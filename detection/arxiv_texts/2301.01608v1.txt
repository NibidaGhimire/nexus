Long -range coherence and correlations between electrons in solids are the cornerstones for 
developing future quantum materials and devices1,2. In 1954, Dicke described correlated 
spontaneous emission from closely packed quantum emitters3, forming the theoretical basis of 
super radiance and superfluorescence. Since then, it has remained an open challenge to observe 
such phenomena with nanometer spatial resolutio n, precisely the important scale at which the  
collective correlation s occur4. Here, we report  the first instance of free -electron -driven 
superfluorescence – superfluorescent cathodol uminescence – enabling us to excite and observe 
correlations at nanometer spatial scales.  To exemplify this concept in our experiments, 
superlattices of lead halide perovskite quantum dots5 are excited  by focused pulse s of multiple 
free electrons.  The electrons trigger superfluorescence:  collective ultrafast emission  observed  at 
rates faster than both the lifetime and decoherence time. By  control ling the area illuminated by 
the electron beam , we  create a transition from  a non -correlated spontaneous emission to a 
correlated superfluorescent emission. The observed signatures of superfluorescence are a 
reduction of the intrinsic emitter lifet ime, a narrower linewidth, and a distinct redshift.  We 
develop the theory of superfluorescent cathodoluminescence, which match es the results and 
highlight s the unique features of electron -driven versus light -driven superfluorescence. Our 
observation and theory introduce a novel way to characterize coherence and correlations in 
quantum materials with nanometer spatial resolution , a key for future engineering of quantum 
devices.

Superfluorescent cathodoluminescence realized with el ectron -triggered perovskite quantum dots  
(QDs) . A pulsed electron beam excites superlattices of QDs. After the interaction, excitonic 
correlations are gradually built between neighboring QDs. Consequently, the superlattice collectively 
emits a short pulse of light.  
The rapid development of quantum technologies in the optical range is motivating  research on 
novel quantum material s that support quantum -coherent optical dynamics . Particular ly importan t are 
materials that can sustain  long- range coherence and strong correlations between spatially separated 
emitters . Quantum  dots (QDs)  are nanometer -size semiconductor crystals that spatially confine their 
excitons , creating  discrete atom -like energy levels and large dipole moments. The dipoles cause strong 
interactions between  excitons and induce correlations between neighboring QDs. Specifically , lead-
halide perovskite (CsPbBr 3) QDs are attractive quantum light emitters6 because of  their large absorption 
cross  section, efficient emission, and very fast radiative rates5,7,8. In closely packed ensembles of such 
QDs, the large dipoles and correlations of excitons were recently shown to create super fluorescence, 
observed as a fast coherent burst of radiation following  a laser pulse excitation2.  
The theory of correlated colle ctive emission from multiple emitters was first described by 
Dicke3. The collective dynamics can be classified  into two distinct  regimes9: the first is Dicke 
superradiance, where the initial excitation pulse  causes the emitters  to be come  correlated , and the 
second is superfluorescence, where the correlation between emitters is built up later during the emission 
process . Both phenomena  necessitate long coherence times and a narrow distribution in the emitters’ 
emission spectra. One of t he distinct signature s of these effects is an increase in emission rate and 
overall intensity that scale with the number of correlated emitters3. 
Superfluorescence  was extensively studied  using light excitation4,9–13 and demonstrated in 
several  solid -state systems (e.g., Refs.2,14–18); however , many of its fundamental properties have 
remained beyond experimental reach. The challenge arises directly from the stringent conditions 
required for superfluorescence  to occur . These include an orchestrated buildup  of correlations between 
multiple emitters  on ultrafast ( usually picosecond) time scales, simultaneously with  very small ( sub-
wavelength ) distances between the emitters. O bservation of superf luorescence phenomena  has been 
limited by the spatial resolution of the experimental probe, bound by the laser wavelength . Notably, the 
 3 probe laser wavelength is two to three orders of magnitude larger than the typical emitter s’ sizes and 
the distances between them , which are the crucial parameters for the buildup  of the correlations  
necessary for superfluorescence.  
Free electrons provide  a probe  with an intrinsic  nanometric resolution that can trigger light 
emission from quantum emitters  through  a process known as  incoherent cathodoluminescence19–22. 
Despite the prevalence of cathodoluminescence techniques, the demonstration of the concept of  free-
electron -driven superfluorescence  has so far  remained inaccessible in experiments . Prominent examples 
of experimentally  accessible cathodoluminescence processes include Cherenkov radiation23, Smith –
Purcell radiation24, and transition radiation25,26. These coherent  cathodoluminescence processes 
describe radiation  emitted from the electrons, mediated by a material with which the electrons interact. 
Consequently, the radiation has certain coherent properties, such as directionality, a polarized nature, 
and even a tunabl e emission profile arising from the spatial shape of the excited electromagnetic mode27. 
In contrast, when free electrons interact with quantum emitters, they trigger another form of 
radiation known as incoherent  cathodoluminescence, which depends on the nature of the emitters and 
their interaction with vacuum fluctuations. The electrons thus provide the energy for the emission  rather 
than emi tting the radiation  directly . This type of process has never been considered for 
superfluorescence or shown any type of col lective emission , as it is commonly considered to be 
incoherent.  
We present a novel  cathodoluminescence  effect:  superfluorescent cathodolu minescen ce, in 
which an ens emble of emitters develop s quantum  correlat ions and emit s collectively following a free-
electron excitation. Despite being a type of incoherent cathodolumines cence, this new form of 
superfluorescence effect has intrinsic quantum coherence  from correlations built up between the 
emitters . 
Our experiment was  based on ultrafast cathodoluminescence  with time-correlated photon 
counting , which in recent years has become a powerful tool  for mapping material response and emission 
lifetime  on scales that are two order s of magnitude smaller than the emitted wavelength28–30. Our 
electron pulses were  a few picoseconds  in duration and contained  an average of 12 electrons per pulse, 
focus ed to nanometer scales inside an ultrafast scanning electron microscope (USEM) . We used these 
electron pulses to excite ensembles of closely  packed  QDs. The excited QDs interacted  and built up 
correlations on the nanoscale , enabl ing us to probe  the resulting emission properties31–33. 
By controlling the electron pulse excitation, we show how the emission can be switched from 
uncorrelated spontaneous emission to correlated superfluorescent emission. We develop the theoretical 
model of superradiant cathodoluminescence, which relies on the fundamental interaction of free  
electrons with quantum emitters31, and show that it fits the experimental data. The theory helps identify  
the threshold between uncorrelated spontaneous and collective superfluorescent emissions, also 
compar ing electron -driven superfluorescence with the conventional light -driven superfluorescence.  
   4 Superfluorescence triggered by free  electrons  
To emphasize the importance of deep sub -wavelength  resolution for this experiment, we now 
present a detailed  breakdown of the microscope and sample used to realize  superfluorescent 
cathodoluminescence. T he ultrafast scanning electron microscope used in the experiment was designed 
around a high numerical aperture reflective optics used to collect  the light and direct  it to a streak camera  
for spectral and temporal analysis ( Fig. 1(a)). The sample consists of quantum dot superlattices imaged 
by an electron microscope  (for synthesis and characterization see S upplementary Information) , as 
shown in three magnifications that highlight the proximity of the  individual QD  emitters, there by which 
enabl e them to develop correlations (Fig. 1(b)). The quantum dot superlattices are held at liquid helium 
cryogenic temperatures and are excited by ultrafast electron pulses. The resulting superfluorescent 
emission  from the samples  is collected and analyzed. To understand the experimental results better , we 
first describe the theoretical framework and related predictions.

apparatusGrating 5 the experiment al results (Fig. 2(h)). We later expanded our  theory t o capture also the effect of the spatial 
distribution of emitters and the influence of  the electron beam size (Fig. 2(a)). We f ound that it is 
sufficient to model each QD as a two -level system by matching the experimental data to theory .  
Our theoretical model starts with an interaction between a single electron and a single QD . We 
then increa se the number  of electrons and QDs  (see Ch. S1 -3 in Supplementary Information). Based on 
Dicke's theory , it is typical to assume that the QDs are located very close to each other, so that all the 
spatial effects can be neglected (see Ch. S4 in Supplementary Information) . Each electron can either 
excite a two -level system ( denoted by 𝜎𝜎 �𝑖𝑖+) by losing energy ( denoted by 𝑏𝑏�) or quench its energy 
(denoted by 𝜎𝜎 �𝑖𝑖−) by gaining energy (denoted by 𝑏𝑏 �†). We show that collective emission (i.e., 
superfluorescence) is possible in this case (see Ch. S5 in Supplementary Information). The interaction 
between the superlatti ce of QDs and a single free  electron can be described by the following scattering 
matrix 𝑆𝑆: 
𝑆𝑆=𝑒𝑒−𝑖𝑖�𝑔𝑔𝑏𝑏�𝑆𝑆̂++𝑔𝑔∗𝑏𝑏�†𝑆𝑆̂−�, (1) 
where 𝑆𝑆̂±=∑𝜎𝜎�𝑖𝑖±
𝑖𝑖 is the summation over excitation 𝜎𝜎 �𝑖𝑖+ and deexcitation 𝜎𝜎 �𝑖𝑖− operators of all the  QDs . 
The states of the quantum system of 𝑁𝑁 QDs located within the interaction volume can be 
described using the symmetric state s basis |𝑙𝑙=0⟩,…,|𝑙𝑙=𝑁𝑁⟩, where each is defined as  a superposition 
of all states of exactly 𝑙𝑙 excited emitters:  
�|𝑙𝑙=𝑁𝑁⟩=|eee…ee⟩,
|𝑙𝑙=𝑁𝑁−1⟩=𝑁𝑁−1𝑙𝑙2(|gee…ee⟩+|ege…ee⟩+⋯+|eee…eg⟩),
…
|𝑙𝑙=0⟩=|ggg…gg⟩.(2) 
|g⟩ and |e⟩ are ground and excited states of the two -level systems. Eq s. (1) and (2) can also be used to 
describe the interaction of 𝑁𝑁 QDs with 𝑁𝑁e electrons . In th is case, the scattering 𝑆𝑆 from Eq. (1) is applied 
for each of 𝑁𝑁 e electrons separately. Eq. ( 2) shows that the interaction with electron s can excite the 
system from the ground state to a higher  symmetric state. An excitation of symmetric state s can lead to 
superradiant dynamics3,9 and result in fast superfluorescent emission analogous  to optical excitation . 
We found that this model successfully captures the dynamics of the excitation and emission that we 
observe  (Fig. 2 (h) and Ch. 5 in Supplementary Information) . However , it does not capture the influence 
of the electron beam size . 
A significant difference between superfluorescence triggered by free electrons and by light is 
that the free electrons can be strongly focused to the nanometer scale, whereas  light focusing is 
diffraction- limited . Notably, t he Dicke model3 and its conventional generalizations4,9–13 cannot describe 
such an excitation. We, therefore,  develop ed a qualitative model that can capture the spatial shape of 
the electron beam and the distribution of emitters  at these length scales (see Ch. 6 in Supplementary 
Information ). Our analysis of the measured emission dynamics showed  that the  superfluorescence 
dynamics can be described by a single lifetime 𝜏𝜏SF parameter, which we can derive from a formula 
analogous to the  one describing  light- driven superfluorescence2: 
𝜏𝜏SF=𝜏𝜏SE
1+𝛼𝛼⋅𝜎𝜎e⋅𝐹𝐹e+Δ𝑡𝑡. (3) 
𝜏𝜏SE is the lifetime of spontaneous emission of a single emitter , 𝛼𝛼 describes  the strength of correlations 
between emitters  scaling with the density of emitters (units of inverse energy) independently of the 
method of excitation, 𝜎𝜎e is a cross -section parameter for the electron interaction with the QD, and 𝐹𝐹e is 
the excitation density of the electron pulse, defined as the total energy  of the multi -electron pulse 
divided by the beam size.  Δ𝑡𝑡 is a delay that encompasses time resolution and other imperfections of the 
measurement.   6 For comparison, 𝐹𝐹𝑒𝑒 is analogous to 𝐹𝐹 ph, the optical excitation density. Similarly, the cross -
section parameter  for electron excitation 𝜎𝜎 e is defined in analogy to the  cross section for light excitation 
𝜎𝜎ph2. Both cross -section parameters 𝜎𝜎e, 𝜎𝜎ph are limited from above by the size of the QD superlattice 
and by the superfluorescence correlation distance.  However, their l imit from below  is substan tially 
different , since the electron beam size is orders of magnitude smaller than that of visible light, e nabling 
us to image superfluorescence with a resolution better than the correlation distance. Our theory shows 
that the superfluorescence lifetime is indeed dependent on 𝜎𝜎e and consequently on the electron beam 
size, in agreement with the results in Fig. 2 (c) and ( h).

(curve) of superfluorescence  (red)  and of spontaneous emission (black). In both theory and 
experiment, the emission intensity and rate are enhanced by the number of correlated emitters, as in 
conventional light -driven superfluorescence.  
 
Our results in Fig. 2 suggest  that superfluorescence can emerge beyond the stringent 
conventional Dicke conditions where all emitters are indistinguishable. We can probe this regime of 
superfluorescence using an electron excitation that is strongly focused , causing emitters at different 
distances from the electron beam center  to interact differently with the electron s. According to the 
conventional Dicke conditions, this inhomogeneity in the excitation may be expected to induce multiple 
emission rates in different areas of the superlattice.  However , the overall dynamics (Fig. 2 (a) and (h)) 
fits a single exponential decay rate, which implies that the correlations induce complete synchronization 
between  the different emitters in  the superlattice, despite their different distances from the electron 
beam size. In other words, all the emitters decay simultaneously , and at the same rate,  despite 
experiencing different excitation  strength s.  
We demonstr ated this experimentally by controlling the electron -beam  size, comparing two 
distinct emission regimes: (1)  The conventional rate of spontaneous emission is measured w hen the 
pulsed electron  beam is defocused  to a larger area (typically micron -scale e.g., 𝑑𝑑=2.5 μm  in the case of 
Fig. 2(e)). For these parameters, we observe emission  with a center wavelength  peak at 𝜆𝜆 =515 nm  (Fig. 
2(b) and Fig. 2( g) black curve)  and a decay time of 𝜏𝜏SE=128 ps  (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 2(f) black curve) . 
We attribute this emission  to uncoupled and uncorrelated QDs  and hypothesize that under these 
conditions  QDs are independently excited and are  too distant  to interact.  (2) Superfluorescent emission  
is measured w hen the pulsed electron beam is focused to a smaller area on a superlattice  (e.g., 𝑑𝑑=10 nm 
in the case of  Fig. 2(d)). For these parameters, we observe a spectrally narrow, redshifted peak at 𝜆𝜆=525 
nm (Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(g) red curve) and a faster decay time of 𝜏𝜏SF=22.5 ps ( Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(h) 
red curve ). We attribute this emission to superfluorescence from coherently coupled QDs. The transition 
from uncorrelated spontaneous emission to superfluorescent emission  is possible when the electron 
density is sufficient to excite several QDs separated by distances considerably  smaller than the emitted 
wavelength  and sufficient to reach an emission time shorter  than the dephasing  of the exciton s.  
We affirm  that the emission  from the focused beam's excitation  is superfluorescent for the four 
following reasons : (1) The emission lifetime  is decreased five -fold relative to spontaneous emission. 
(2) The emission spectral  linewidth  is reduced ten -fold relative to spontaneous emission . (3) The 
emission spectrum fits a Lorentzian line shape, rather than Gaussian line shapes that fit  all the 
measurements of uncorrelated  QDs and of low -density excitations . These line shape s agree  with the 
theoretical model of superfluorescence. (4) The emission spectrum is redshifted by ~10 nm . Recent ly, 
authors have  question ed superfluorescen ce from CsPbBr 3 QDs when exposed to air because of  fusing 
and formation of bulk -like domains34. Our samples are encapsulated in polymeric matrices to prevent 
such degradation35,36. Moreover , the ability to switch reversibly between superfluorescent and  8 uncoupled spontaneous emission signifies  that the quantum confined QDs remain  intact. This 
conclusion is also supported by structural and spectroscopic characterization s (see also SEM 
micrographs in SI) , where no traces of bulk formation or emission are observed. The results  are verified 
by more than 20 independent measurements conducted on different QD superlattices, with the focused 
electron beam  and 4 control measurements with the defocused beam  (See Table 1 in SI) .  
The spectral redshift  is explained by a short -range dipole -dipole interaction be tween excitons . 
Similar redshifts were measured  in molecular J-aggregates  and for excitons in CsPbBr 3 QDs2,37. The 
central wavelength redshift  𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥 can be estimated  by38: 
Δ𝛥𝛥≈2|𝐽𝐽c|=2𝜇𝜇2
4𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋𝑅𝑅3, (4) 
where 𝜋𝜋 is the permittivity of the surrounding material (causing screening), 𝜇𝜇 is the dipole moment of 
the exciton, and 𝑅𝑅  is the distance between excitons. For  our CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals, the dipole moment 
is 𝜇𝜇~7 nm ×e 5 and 𝑅𝑅~14 nm , giving a redshift of ~10 nm, similar to the observed redshift.  
For comparison, we also analyzed  cathodoluminescence from the interaction of a continuous 
wave (CW)  electron  beam and the superlattice  QDs. In this regime , only the spontaneous emission peak 
is observed  (see Fig. S5) , while no superfluorescence is detected . We assign this to the low electron 
beam current of ~ 2 nA in CW mode  (focused to a  beam size of ~50 nm resulting in an electron beam 
density of ~6 ×106 electrons /(s⋅nm2)) that corresponds  to ~0.01 electrons /ps impinging on the 
superlattice , which is not a sufficient rate to generate superfluorescence.  With such a low excitation 
rate, we do not excite more than one emitter before the dephasing of the excitons ( between 50 to 80 ps  
in the perovskite QDs6), and therefore , only spontaneous  emission is observed.  
Comparing electron -driven  and light -driven superflu orescence  
We expanded  our experiment to complement  the electron -triggered superfluorescence by light-
triggered superfluorescence  from the same samples. We excite d the sample by a UV  laser  at cryogenic 
temperatures (Fig. 3 (a)). These experiments emphasized analogies  and differences between light -
triggered  superfluorescence and electron -triggered  superfluorescence . The results portrayed in Fig. 3(b) 
show that emission measured from the samples under optical excitation presents two emission peaks, 
as reported by Rainò  et al.2 for the same QDs. The blueshifted peak is interpreted as spontaneous 
emission (uncorrelated QDs) and the redshifted  peak as superfluorescen t emission  (correlated QDs) . 
This spectrum is d ifferent from electron -triggered superfluorescence, which allows  us to isolate the 
individual peaks  and tune the spectrum from one peak to the other by changing the electron excitation 
conditions .   9  
Fig 3. Validation of superfluorescence from the QDs  using optical excitation. (a) Illustration of 
conventional superfluorescence triggered by optical excitation . Here , the beam size 𝑑𝑑 is larger than 
the emitted wavelength 𝜆𝜆 and often  overlap s with more than one superlattice . (b) Emission spectrum  
from the optical excitation: we observe spontaneous emission and superfluorescence simultaneously. 
The superfluorescence peak is located at 530 nm, with a linewidth of 2.4 nm. The spontaneous 
emission peak is at 515 nm with a linewidth of 5.4 nm.  (c) Optical spectra for different excitation 
power s. (d) Intensity of the spontaneous emission peak s (black dots) and of the superfluorescence 
peak s (red dots) as a function of excitation power. The black and red dotted curves fit linear and square 
functions  to the experimental data for spontaneous and superfluorescent emission , respectively .  
Optical setup s constrained  by the diffraction  limit lack the spatial resolution to resolve 
superfluorescent and spontaneous peaks separately , as we demonstrated in the time -resolved 
cathodoluminescence experiment . Nevertheless, in a power -dependent excitation experiment, we 
observe d the different optical re sponses of the two peaks. The excitation power varied between 1 and 
100 μW (Fig. 3( c)), which corresponds to an excitation difference of 2 –200 photons/ps per beam area 
(with a beam size of ~1 μm, which statistically contains one superlattice of QDs). We ca n see a 
functional difference in the intensity of the two emission peaks. The intensity of the blueshifted peak 
scales linearly with the excitation power , as expected from spontaneous emission. In contrast, the 
intensity of the redshifted peak scales with  a supralinear dependence on the excitation power, as 
expected from  superfluorescent emission (Fig. 3 (d)). Both scaling laws agree with the trend predicted 
by theory3,9. For continuous light excitation, superfluorescence was  achieved only when the exciting 
photon flux was sufficient to excite several neighboring QDs faster than the QDs ’ dephasing time 
T2=50-80ps  6. An additional emission peak at 520 nm was observed when the excitation power 
exceed ed 30 μW. This peak is attributed to multi -excitons, bi -excitons , and trions39,40. The presence of

 10 such multi- excitons explains the deviation from linear scaling  for spontaneous emission in Fig. 3( d). 
Specifically, the central 515 nm peak is reduced at the expense of increased emission at the 520 nm 
multi- exciton peak.  
A compari son of  electron - and light -driven experiments  thus shows  that spontaneous emission 
and superfluorescence are observed simultaneously in a light-triggered  experiment  (Fig. 3 (b)), while  in 
an electron -triggered experiment we can observe  them  separately by varying the electron  beam size 
(Fig. 2 (g)). Another  difference is the linewidth of the spontaneous emission spectral peak . The spectral 
linewidth of electron -triggered spontaneous emission (defocused electron beam) is three times as broad 
as its light -driven counterpart  (15 nm vs . 5.4 nm) . We hypothesize that this broadening stems from the 
fundamental difference between electron and light interaction with matter : in light –matter interactions, 
the entire quantized photon energy is transferred in a process of ab sorption or stimulated emission. In 
contrast, in electron –matter interactions, energy transfer is not limited to quantized amounts, and a 
continuous change of energy is possible in the excitation or quenching of the QDs’ excitons. Therefore, 
free-electron excitations below the density threshold for superfluorescence typically create a broader 
emission spectrum than optical excitations.   
The most interesting  difference between electron - and light -driven superfluorescence is in the 
linewidth of the superfluorescence spectral peak. In contrast  to the linewidths of spontaneous emission, 
here we find the electron -driven linewidth to be narrower than the light -driven linewidth (1.9  nm vs . 
2.4 nm). We hypothesize that this  difference  arises from the smaller electron beam size , which can 
substantially reduce the inhomogeneous broadening, isolating  coherent emission with  linewidth that is 
mostly due to intrinsic coher ent broadening. This explanation is further support ed by the good fit of the 
Lorentzian line shape  (Fig. 2 (g)). 
 
Discussion  
It is valuable to distinguish the free -electron -driven superfluorescence observed in this study  
from other processes of enhanced free- electron emission. For example, free- electron superradiance32,41 
is a term often used to describe  radiation in free -electron lasers and in other processes where the 
emission is directly from  the electrons and enhanced by electron bunching. In another example, 
electrons impinging specially patterned surfaces (e.g., metamaterials and metasurfaces) excite 
collective electromagnetic mode25,27,42,43 that alter the radiation angular distribution. This type of 
holographic free -electron radiation is emitted from the electron rather than from quantum emitters ; i.e., 
the surface pattern mediates the radiation emission without undergoing electronic transitions as in 
quantum emitters.  
We also distinguish superfluorescence from amplified spontaneous emission, often called 
superluminescence. The latter arises from stimulated  emission by an active gain medium ( e.g., observed 
for lead -halide perovskites44). In comparison, superfluorescence is purely spontaneous , rather than 
stimulated. The signature characteristics  of superfluorescence that we observed – shortened decay time 
and narrower emission spectrum – do not appear in any of the other processes of enhanced emission. 
Superfluorescence is uniquely created by the symmetry of the joint wavefunction shared by multi ple 
interacting emitters. Our observed enhancements, much like the broader family of superradiance 
phenomena, is purely due to transitions between Dicke -superradiant symmetric states.  
Our analysis of  electron -driven superfluorescence is based on the theor y recently proposed in  
Ref.45 for the interaction of an electron with a single emitter  (free-electron –bound -electron resonance 
interaction ), which has led to substantial theory follow -up works (e.g., Refs.31,46–49). We ext ended the 
previous works  to capture  superfluorescence using the symmetric states from the Dicke theory  in place 
of the two -level system model3. This  theory enables us to emphasize the differen ce between light-  and 
electron -driven excitation s.   11 Outlook  
We have demonstrated a new type of superfluorescence : that triggered  by pulses of free 
electrons . i.e., superfluorescent cathodoluminescence.  Control  of the electron beam size  allows us to 
switch between the  distinct emission regimes of spontaneous emission and superfluorescence. We 
further demonstrate d the significant differences between light and electron excitations. A focused free -
electron beam drives a pure superfluorescent emission, whereas the light -driven excitation induces a 
mixture of superfluorescence and spontaneous emission. Our work thus establishes that the underlying 
nature of superfluorescence is independent of the type of excitation, free- electron or optical.  
Superfluorescent cathodoluminesc ent occurs only when the effective beam area is larger than 
a single quantum dot and smaller than the correlation distance  between quantum emitters. Thus , future 
experiments could use the electron beam size as a new degree of freedom to extract information  about 
the nature of superfluorescence, revealing the density of correlations with nanometer resolution . This 
degree of freedom enable s us to observe superfluorescent  emission separated from any trace of regular 
spontaneous emission, which has not been possible in conventional optical experiments.  
The agreement between experiment and theory motivates us to use our  theoretical  model  as a 
tool for the design of future fundamental experiments in electron -light- matter interaction . We envision 
the next steps to utilize electrons for coherent control of multiple correlated emitters at deep 
subwavelength resolution. This idea, in  combination with recent  development s in ultra fast electron 
microscopy  33,47,50–53, suggest s that coherent shaping of the electron s’ wavefunctions could  control 
coherent effects in superfluorescence that cannot be accessed with optical excitations.  
 We anticipate that superfluorescence excited by free  electrons will have applications  in the 
wider fields of electron microscopy and spectroscopy . For example, electron -triggered 
superfluorescence can be used to characterize the collective emission from QDs embedded in photonic 
cavities and waveguides 54 or in integrated photonic on- chip devices  55,56. Moreover,  in bio -related 
studies, superfluorescent correlated aggregates can be used as extra bright markers for beam -sensitive 
biological samples in electron microscopy . Such superfluorescent markers would enable deep 
subwavelength spatial resolution with reduced electron flux for the same acquired signal.  A different 
application could use superfluorescence to improve the sensitivity and response time of free-electron  
cameras  that are based on  cathodoluminescence . Such cameras are used in nuclear physics experiments, 
light intensifiers, electron microscopes, and other electron -based quality inspection systems in the 
semiconductor industry .

 Supplementary Note 1 - Colloidal CsPbBr 3 QDs synthesis  
Materials :  
Benzoyl bromide (97%, Aldrich), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.9%, Aldrich), lead acetate  
trihydrate (99.99%, Aldrich), oleic acid (OA, 90%, Aldrich), oleylamine (OLA, 70%, Aldrich), toluene 
(A.R., Aldrich) , Polystyrene (PS) (Aldrich). All chemicals were used as purchased without further 
purification methods . 
 
Synthesis of CsPbBr 3 QDs : 
CsPbBr 3 NPs are synthesized following a published procedure by Imran et al1. With slight 
modification in temperatures. In a typical synthesis, 16 mg (0.05 mmol) of cesium  carbonate, 76 mg 
(0.2 mmol) of lead acetate tr ihydrate, 0.3 ml of OA, 1 mL of OLA, and 5 mL of ODE were loaded into 
a 25 mL 3- neck round- bottom flask, and dried under  vacuum for 1 hour at 100 °C. Then, the solution 
was heated to 170°C under nitrogen, and 0.07 ml (0.6mmol) of benzoyl bromide was swiftly injected. 
The reaction mixture was  immediately cooled down in an ice -water . 
 
Isolation and purification of CsPbBr 3 QDs : 
5 mL of toluene was added to the crude solutions, and the resulting mixture was centrifuged for 
10 minutes at 4000 rpm . The supe rnatant was discarded, and the precipitate was redispersed in 5 mL of 
toluene  for further use.  
 
Optical and structural characterization  of the Colloidal CsPbBr 3 QDs synthesis:  
The colloidal solution is characterized by absorption- emission spectroscopy and by 
transmission electron  microscopy (TEM  - FEI Tecnai G2 T20 S -Twin TEM ). The QDs are highly 
crystalline with an average size of 7.5 nm. The optical properties of the QDs and their crystalline 
structure are shown in Fig. S3a. The TEM image of the QDs and t he distribution of the QDs sizes are 
shown in Fig. S3b and Fig. S3c.  
Supplementary Note 2 - QDs superlattices in polystyrene thin -film sample preparation  
A Si wafer  was cut to 15x15 mm and cleaned by an ultrasonic bath of acetone for 10 minutes, 
isopropanol for 10 minutes, and HLCP water for 10 minutes then dried by a stream of nitrogen until no 
visible water droplets appear. The wafer  was left for one minute on 110C hot plate and left to cool down 
for two minutes before the solution spin coating deposition.  
QDs in PS solution preparation and deposition:  
A 0.36 g of PS was mixed in 9.5 ml of toluene by magnetic stirring. 0.5 ml of the Colloidal 
CsPbBr 3 QDs solution was added to the solution after the PS was fully dissolved. This solution was 
deposited on the  pre-cleaned Si wafer through 1 minute of spin coating at 2000 rpm in a clean room 
environment.

Supplementary Note 3 - Structural characterization  
The sample is characterized  by an SEM (Zeiss Ultra- Plus FEG -SEM) and FIB SEM  (Dual beam 
FIB - Helios nano- lab G3 FEI) . The results are shown in Figs. 1c, 1d in the main text and Figs S1 and 
S2. We  noticed  the superlattices are either at the surface of the polymer or at the polymer and substrate 
interface.

polystyrene (PS). The sample is cut with a focused ion beam (FEI Helios NanoLab DualBeam G3 UC) and imaged 
in the same system.  
We also noticed that  the superlattic e's average size is controlled by the QD -to-polymer concentration 
ratio.  We demonstrated that by preparing samples of fixed PS solution and changing the ratio of the 
colloidal QDs solution from the same batch and toluene while keeping the total volume the same. We 
observed that the average size of the superlattices size increases with the concentration of the colloidal 
solution as  shown in Fig S2.

The excitation of  free electron  cathodoluminescence  (CL)  
All the cathodoluminescence  (CL)  experiments were conducted on an Allalin Chronos ultrafast 
scanning electron microscope (USEM) by Attolight. The free-electron excitation experiment takes place 
inside the USEM vacuum chamber , where the sample is cool ed to 10 K  to increase exciton coherence 
times .  We use a 3 keV e-beam with a beam current of 2 nA to image and excite the QDs. To generate 
a pico -secon d electron pulse , the electron gun was excited by an 80 MHz pulsed laser . The resulting 
electron pulse s contained approximately 12 electrons per pulse. The CL emission is analyzed wi th a 
high-speed CDD camera (Andor Newton 920) . The CL is analyzed using a  streak camera (Hamamatsu 
C10910) for time -resolved CL ( TRCL ) measurements, which are shown in Fig. S4.

Fig. S 4. Streak image s of time-resolved cathodoluminescence (CL) . Note the substantially different wavelength 
scales and time scales.  (a) Raw streak camera data for CL was created by  a focused electron excitation (10 nm)  
of a single superlattice . The image is taken across 180 ps along the time axis and 10 nm along the spectral axis  
from a single superlattice .  (b)  Raw streak camera data for CL was created by a defocused electron excitation (3 
μm). The image is taken across 410 ps along the time axis and 9 0 nm along the spectral axis. ( c) and (d) The raw 
data was processe d using Gaussian kernel density estimation  (KDE)2. The right insets  present the corresponding 
emission spectra by integrat ing over the time axis. These spectra are fitted to a Lorentzian in (c) and  a Gaussian 
in (d) . The bottom insets present the time-dependent emission  by integrating over  the wavelength axis . The values 
of the decay times were extracted by fitting them to an exponent.   
Our f ocused electron pulse measurements were repeated 22  times , each measuring a different 
superlattice. The d efocused beam measurements were repeated 4 times , covering  different areas. The  
result analysis is summarized in table S1  
Table S1 . Summary of 26 time -resolved CL experiments and the appropriate temporal and spectral statistical 
analysis. Each row summarizes 4 (22) measurements carried out using a defocused (focused) electron beam 
excitation, triggering emission from uncoupled ( coupled)  quantum dots  (QDs) in superlattices. These 
measurements show the 5 -fold reduction of the decay time and a 10 nm redshift of the emission wavelength for 
coupled QDs compared with uncoupled QDs.  The spectral analysis shows that the  spectral shape of emission from 
uncoup led QDs fits better to a Gaussian, while the spectral shape of emission from coupled QDs fits better to a 
Lorentzian.  
Continuous -wave ( CW) CL from QD s superlattices  
We compare the measurements of TRCL obtained using electron pulses with conventional CL 
obtained using regular, i.e.,  CW electron beams. Fig. S5 a hyperspectral  image of the sample was taken 
in CW mode. Panels (a) and (b) show a direct  correlation between the superl attices’ SEM  secondary 
electron image and the CL image . Each spectral point contains a single broad peak (FWHM>15 nm) 
where no spectral trace s of superfluorescence (i.e., peaks  with FWHM<5)  appeared . The e -beam current 
here is 2 nA and the beam spot size is ~ 50 nm.

Stability of CsPbBr 3 QDs under electron beam irradiation 
 Material structural stability is of great concern in electron beam characterization. Beam damage 
is known to extensively affect both halide perovskites3,4   and lead -free perovskites5. During the pulse 
excitation experiment (discussed in the main text) we observed a decrease of the signal with no change 
in the emission spectrum. We attribute this degradation to carbon contamination that could arise from 
the polymer matrix. However, we expect  that in the CW regime there is  a significant  degradation. We 
perform a sequence of measurements over a period of 6 minutes to estimate the degradation of the 
sample under CW e-beam excitation . The electron beam is focused to ~50 nm with a current of ~2 nA. 
In this regime, o nly the spontaneous emission peak is observed  Fig. S6 presents CL spectra and their 
gradual evolution during the experiment . The emission peak decay s to half the intensity after exposure 
of ~20 s and continue s to slowly degrade . The decay is not uniform and reveals an underlying weaker 
emission presented as a shoulder at 527  nm. We attribute this to the fusing of QDs and the formation 
of bulk CsPbBr 3. Such e mission  agrees with previous work on bulk CsPbBr 3 with the same CL 
microscope6.

excitation, showing the timescale under which degradation of the sample occurs . 
 
Optical measurements  
To compare with the CL measurements, we also performed optic al measurements on the same 
samples, using  a 405 nm CW diode laser . The results are depicted in Fig. 4a  of the main text . The laser 
beam is focused using a 20x objective with NA of 0.29 and the working distance of  31 mm, reaching  a 
laser spot diameter of 880 nm on the  cooled sampl e (~10 K ). The spectrum of the emission is detected 
with a TRIAX 552 spectrometer equipped with a cooled CCD (Roper Scientific).  
 
Supplemenary Note 4 - Theoretical description of free electrons superfluorescence  
The following  supplementary section provide s a detail ed discussion of  the theoretical model 
used to explain the observed superfluorescence triggered by free electrons. We found that u sing a two -
level system (TLS) model  to describe each QD 's exciton is a good approximation that captures the main 
features observed in our experiment.  We construct a theoretical model that describes the interaction of 
electrons with multiple TLS emitters, where each  electron can either excit e or quench the energy of the 
excitons' collective . We show that collective emission  (i.e., superfluorescence)  is indeed possible in this 
case.  
A typical electron interaction can transfer more energy than required for a direct TLS excitation. 
For example, the electron usually excites a bulk plasmon, which then excites one or more electron -hole 
pairs that relax to create the effective TLS excitation7. Therefore, our theory cannot account for the 
electron energy loss . The theory accounts for the excitation of the multi -TLS system of QD s' excitons , 
which creates the necessary initial condition for the superfluorescent emission dynamics.  
 
Interaction of a single electron with a single two -level system  
In this section , we show how the quantum theory of interaction between a free electron and a 
two-level system corresponds to the known theory of free -electron -atom interaction  (Fig. S7) , described 
back in  1930s by Bethe8 and can be found in the textbooks9. This theory was recently revisited in more 
modern contexts, which could be appl icable  for experiments in electron microscopes, under the  name 
8 
 free-electron bound- electron resonant interaction  (FEBE RI) 10. Quantum mechanical treatments  11,12 
followed the original semiclassical theory.  
 
Fig. S7 . Interaction of an energetic electron with a single two -level system  (TLS ). 
Using the language of quantum optics, t he scattering matrix of the interaction between a free 
electron and a single TLS can be calculated according to the following formula  10–12: 
𝑆𝑆=𝑒𝑒−𝑖𝑖�𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝜎𝜎++𝑔𝑔∗𝑔𝑔†𝜎𝜎−�,     (S1) 
where 𝑏𝑏,𝑏𝑏† are the electron energy shift operators ( 𝑏𝑏 reduces the electron energy by  ℏ𝜔𝜔0, while 𝑏𝑏† 
increases it by  ℏ𝜔𝜔0), and 𝜎𝜎−,𝜎𝜎+ are the ladder operators of a TLS . The interaction constant 𝑔𝑔 is: 
𝑔𝑔(𝑟𝑟⊥)=𝑒𝑒𝜔𝜔0
2𝜋𝜋𝜀𝜀0ℏ𝑣𝑣2�𝑑𝑑⊥𝐾𝐾1�2𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟⊥
𝜆𝜆0𝑣𝑣/𝑐𝑐�+𝑑𝑑∥𝐾𝐾0�2𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟⊥
𝜆𝜆0𝑣𝑣/𝑐𝑐��.   (S2) 
𝑒𝑒 is an elementary charge, 𝑣𝑣 is the speed of the electron, 𝑑𝑑⊥ and 𝑑𝑑∥ are the projections of the transition 
dipole moment of the quantum dot on the direction perpendicular and parallel to the electron motion to 
the motion, respectively, 𝑟𝑟⊥ is the distance between the electron’s trajectory and the position of the TLS  
(Fig. 1S). Eq. (S2) can be significantly simplified in case the effective distance to the exciton 𝑟𝑟⊥is small:  
2𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟⊥
𝜆𝜆0𝑣𝑣/𝑐𝑐≪1.     (S3) 
For example, for electron kinetic energy of 3 keV and 𝜆𝜆0=500  nm, we get the condition of Eq. (S 3) 
to be equivalent to a distance of 𝑟𝑟⊥≪80 nm. Under this condition, Eq. ( S2) can be simplified to:  
𝑔𝑔(𝑟𝑟⊥)≈𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑑⊥
2𝜋𝜋𝜀𝜀0ℏ𝑣𝑣 𝑟𝑟⊥.     (S4) 
Then t he probability to excite a QD by a single electron  is 
𝑃𝑃e=|⟨e|⊗⟨𝐸𝐸−ℏ𝜔𝜔0|𝑆𝑆|𝐸𝐸⟩⊗|g⟩|2, 
where |𝐸𝐸⟩ and |𝐸𝐸−ℏ𝜔𝜔0⟩ are the electron sta tes with energ ies 𝐸𝐸 and 𝐸𝐸−ℏ𝜔𝜔0. |g⟩ and |e⟩ are the ground 
and excited state s of the TLS. Substituting Eq. ( S1), we get the following expression for the probability 
of the excitation:  
𝑃𝑃e=sin2|𝑔𝑔(𝑟𝑟⊥)|.     (S5) 
The probabi lity to excite  the TLS  in the approximation of |𝑔𝑔|≪1 equals to:  
𝑃𝑃e=sin2|𝑔𝑔(𝑟𝑟⊥)|≈|𝑔𝑔(𝑟𝑟⊥)|2=4𝑒𝑒2|𝑑𝑑⊥|2
(4𝜋𝜋𝜀𝜀0)2ℏ2𝑣𝑣2 𝑟𝑟⊥2.    (S6) 
Eq. ( S6) is a well -known equation for the excitation of an atom by a charged particle9.  
We note that for electron interactions with solid -state systems, there are additional mechanisms 
that compete with this direct interaction, such as the excitation of a bulk plasmon. The unique aspect of 
the interaction described here is that it maintains coherence throughout the interaction. In contrast, an 
excitation of the TLS through other mechanism s, such as through bulk plasmon excitation, will not 
e-9 
 maintain coherence, since part of the electron energy will go to other channels. As we show in the 
sections below, maintaining coherence is necessary to create the effect of superradiance, but not to 
create the effect of superfluorescence. In our experiment, we do not know whether the electron 
excitation is direct (as in this section) or indirect, and thus w e can only claim to observe 
superfluorescence, rather than superradiance. It remains an open challenge for future experiments to 
provide the direct experimental evidence necessary for a claim of electron -driven superradiance. This 
for example could be done  using a combined CL and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)13, where 
the amount of energy lost by the electron could be correlated with the energy transferred to CL.  
 
Interaction  of multiple electrons with a single two -level system  
In this section , we show that free elect rons cannot fully excite a TLS. Specifically, free electrons 
can only create TLS states with excited level probabilities of up to one half. According to Eq. (S5), after 
the interaction with 𝑁𝑁 e consequent electrons , the probability of the TLS to be excited  equals to  
𝑃𝑃𝑁𝑁e=sin2𝑔𝑔�1−cos𝑁𝑁e2𝑔𝑔�
1−cos2𝑔𝑔≤1/2.     (S7) 
Fig. S8 presents 𝑃𝑃𝑁𝑁e as the function of 𝑁𝑁e for a fixed 𝑔𝑔. The limitation on the TLS excitation can be 
explained simpl y: when the TLS is excited to less than on half (i.e., 𝑃𝑃𝑁𝑁e≤1/2) th en the electron on 
average transfers its energy to the TLS ; when the TLS is excited to more than on half (i.e., 𝑃𝑃𝑁𝑁e≥1/2) 
then the electron on average gain s energy from the TLS. So, if the initial TLS was in the ground state 
(𝑃𝑃𝑁𝑁e=0), after its interaction  with any number of electrons , it will remain  at 𝑃𝑃𝑁𝑁e≤1/2. As we show 
below, this limit prevents us from reaching part of the effects of superradiance but does not prohibit 
creating the effects of superfluorescence. We note that this limit can be overcome by pre -shaping the 
electron wavefunction, as was predicted  theoretically14.

excitation is bounded by 50%.  The simulation  here assume s interaction constant 𝑔𝑔=0.1. 
 
Incoherent interaction of electrons with multiple two- level systems 
In this section, we discuss the incoherent  interaction of free electrons  with multiple TLS. T his 
theory usually describes electron interactions in thick materials  (containing at least a few dozens of 
atomic layer s), and is observed in other experimental cases of cathodoluminescence  (CL)  with no t 
correlated emission . We show that this type of interaction is captured by our theory.  Let us consider a 
material where TLS  are distributed uniformly inside the sample (Fig. S9 ).

Fig. S9. Interaction of an energetic electron with a sample containing a uniform distribution of TLSs . 
 
According to section S1, under the approximation of Eq. ( S3), we can write the probability of 
a single TLS excitation as  𝑃𝑃e=4𝑒𝑒2|𝑑𝑑⊥|2
(4𝜋𝜋𝜀𝜀0)2ℏ2𝑣𝑣2 𝑟𝑟⊥2. When considering only this interaction mechanism, the 
average energy loss of an electron after the interaction with a single TLS is  thus : 
〈𝐸𝐸⟩=𝑃𝑃e⋅ℏ𝜔𝜔0=4𝑒𝑒2|𝑑𝑑⊥|2𝜔𝜔0
(4𝜋𝜋𝜀𝜀0)2ℏ𝑣𝑣2 𝑟𝑟⊥2. 
Now consider a cylind rical volume  (Fig. S9) with an internal radius 𝑅𝑅 min, external radius  𝑅𝑅max, and 
length 𝑧𝑧. The total electron energy loss due to the spatial distribution of the TLS in this cylinder is  
𝐸𝐸=𝑛𝑛⋅𝑧𝑧⋅8𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒2|𝑑𝑑⊥|2𝜔𝜔0
(4𝜋𝜋𝜀𝜀0)2ℏ𝑣𝑣2 �𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑟
𝑟𝑟𝑅𝑅max
𝑅𝑅min, 
where 𝑛𝑛 is the number of TLS per unit volume. W e can translate this formula to the loss of electron per 
unit length:  
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑=8𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒2𝑛𝑛|𝑑𝑑⊥|2𝜔𝜔0
(4𝜋𝜋𝜀𝜀0)2ℏ𝑣𝑣2 ln𝑅𝑅max
𝑅𝑅min.    (S8) 
The minimum radius is connected with the effective size of an exciton ( i.e., excited TLS) 𝑅𝑅 min =𝑎𝑎, 
while the large radius is connected with the approximation of Eq. ( S3): 𝑅𝑅max≈𝑣𝑣
𝜔𝜔0. Thus, we get:  
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑=4𝜋𝜋𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑒2|𝑑𝑑⊥|2𝜔𝜔0
(4𝜋𝜋𝜀𝜀0)2ℏ𝑣𝑣2 ln�𝑣𝑣2
𝜔𝜔02𝑎𝑎2�.    (S9) 
Eq. ( S9) represents the non-relativistic Bethe -Bloch formula in the case of the free  electron  9. 
With the proper estimation of the dipole moment, exciton’s radius , and transition  frequency, we arrive 
at the conventional form of the Bethe -Bloch equation:

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑=4𝜋𝜋𝑛𝑛

 where 𝐼𝐼 is the ionization potential  and 𝑚𝑚e is the electron mass (appearing by substituting formulas for 
the exciton’s radius and the effective dipole) . This equation is also the conventional result found in the 
literature on in coherent CL15. 
Coherent interaction of free electrons with matter  
This section c onsider s a novel regime of interaction between free electron s and quantum 
emitters . This interaction regime is completely different from the conventional cases described in the 
previous sections , and we find it to be the one relevant to our experiment. Reaching this novel 
interaction regime requires satisfying several strict  condition s. For example,  we work at very low 
temperatures to main coherence between the emitters for the entire duration of their emission . We 
develop a simple qualitative model  that can  explain the mai n features of the observed superfluorescence.  
We assume a dense cluster of emitters (e.g., QDs) that satisfies  two conditions  on the 
parameters defined in Fig. S10: 
�𝑑𝑑≪𝑟𝑟⊥
𝑑𝑑≪𝜆𝜆0.     (S11) 
We should note that such a situation is compl etely different from what we considered in the previous 
section (Fig. S9 ). While in the previous section we considered a uniform  distribution of emitters in the 
sample, here we consider an opposite situation – a dense cluster of concentrated  emitters , where we can 
treat all the emitters as being approximately at the same  point . Interestingly, this case can be described 
by a direct generalization of the formalism of Eq. ( S1). 
 
Fig. S10. Interaction of an energetic electron with a dense  cluster of emitters  
The scattering matrix for the emitters can now be described by the replacing the individual  
emitter  operators 𝜎𝜎± in Eq. (S1)  that describe a spin half system,  by the operators 𝑆𝑆± of a general 
(higher than one half) spin state : 
𝑆𝑆=𝑒𝑒−𝑖𝑖�𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑆𝑆++𝑔𝑔∗𝑔𝑔†𝑆𝑆−�.     (S12)  
These  operators 𝑆𝑆± describe the raising and lowering operations on the ladder of symmetric states, 
which can be written as the sum  𝑆𝑆±=∑𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖±
𝑖𝑖 over all the emitters . The Hilbert state of 𝑁𝑁 
indistinguishable  emitters is described in terms of the symmetric states defined as  
⎩⎪⎨⎪⎧|𝑁𝑁⟩=|eee…ee⟩,
|𝑁𝑁−1⟩=�1
𝑁𝑁(|gee…ee⟩+|ege…ee⟩+⋯+|eee…eg⟩)

 where |𝑚𝑚⟩ is the symmetric state with 𝑚𝑚  excited emitters. The matrix element of the scattering matrix 
in Eq. ( S12) can be calculated in th e following way:  
⟨𝑚𝑚|𝑆𝑆|𝑛𝑛⟩= 𝑏𝑏𝑛𝑛−𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆𝑚𝑚𝑛𝑛,      (S14)  
with 𝑆𝑆𝑚𝑚𝑛𝑛 being

𝑘𝑘=0. 
The initial state of the joint system of electron and cluster of emitters is 
𝜌𝜌(i)=|0⟩⟨0|⊗|𝐸𝐸⟩⟨𝐸𝐸|,      (S15)  
|0⟩ is the state of the cluster with all of the TLS are in the ground state, and |𝐸𝐸⟩ is the state of the 
electron with energy 𝐸𝐸 . The density matrix of the  TLS after the interaction  with electrons is  
𝜌𝜌em(f)=Tre�𝑆𝑆𝜌𝜌(i)𝑆𝑆†�. 
Tre is the trace over the electron  degrees of freedom , which enables to calculate the final state  of the 
emitters  
𝜌𝜌em(f)=∑𝑃𝑃𝑛𝑛|𝑛𝑛⟩⟨𝑛𝑛|𝑛𝑛       (S16)  
that contains the probabilities 𝑃𝑃𝑛𝑛 to 𝑛𝑛 excitons : 
𝑃𝑃𝑛𝑛=𝑁𝑁!
(𝑁𝑁−𝑛𝑛)!𝑛𝑛!𝑃𝑃e𝑛𝑛(1−𝑃𝑃e)𝑁𝑁−𝑛𝑛,     (S17)  
with 𝑃𝑃e being the probability to excite a single TLS defined by Eq. ( S3). Eq. ( S17) represents the 
binomial distribution . In the case of 𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒≪1 and 𝑁𝑁≫1 we get : 
𝑃𝑃𝑛𝑛≈𝑒𝑒−𝜆𝜆
𝑛𝑛!𝜆𝜆𝑛𝑛,      (S18)  
where 𝜆𝜆=𝑃𝑃e𝑁𝑁=|𝑔𝑔|2𝑁𝑁. We note tha t in this limit, Eq. ( S18) represents the conventional probability 
of multi -excitation by a single electron, corresponding to results often observed in experiments of 
electron energy loss spectroscopy16. As we show below, this theory provides a good quantitative model 
for our experiment. Even for larger cluster  sizes and larger interaction  areas  that go slightly beyond the 
conditions of Eq. (S11), we find the theory to still provide a good qualitative explanation for the features 
observed in our experiment. 
 
Superra diance  effects  triggered by free electrons  
The difference between our work and most previous works  on CL is the combination of : (1) 
the large dipole moment of the emitters ( ≈7 nm⋅𝑒𝑒, where 𝑒𝑒 is an elementary charge); (2) close 
distance between emitters (approaching the conditions of Eq. (S11));  and (3) long coherence  times due 
to the low temperature  that enables to maintain correlations between the emitters . Satisfying all these 
conditions  is what  enables  observ ing for the first time  superfluorescence  triggered by free electrons . In 
comparison, previous papers such as7 observed CL from closely packed semiconductor nanocrystals 
but did not observe superradiance phenomena , since the  temperature was not low  enough to support 
sufficien t coherence between emitters.  
To describe the dynamics of emission in the experiment, we build a simple model which 
combines the results of the previous section with the  Dicke superradiance theory17. According to the 
results of the previous sect ion, after interaction with a single electron, the density matrix of the emitters  13 
 is described by Eq. ( S16). Let us now consider the interaction with multiple consequent elect rons with 
a time delay 𝜏𝜏 between each pair as depicted in Fig. S11 (this delay 𝜏𝜏 will be later taken as the mean 
distance between electron s in the distribution of random electron arrival times).  
 
Fig. S11. Interaction of multiple energetic electrons with a dense cluster of emitters  
 
The state of the cluster of emitters after the interaction with a single electron is described by  
𝜌𝜌em𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚(f)=⟨𝑚𝑚|Tre�𝑆𝑆𝜌𝜌(i)𝑆𝑆†�|𝑚𝑚⟩=∑|𝑆𝑆𝑚𝑚𝑛𝑛|2𝜌𝜌em𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛(i)

Eq. ( S19) can be written in matrix form if we define the column of diagonal elements of emitters density 
matrix:  
𝜌𝜌⃗em=�𝜌𝜌0
𝜌𝜌1

𝜌𝜌𝑁𝑁�, where  𝜌𝜌𝑛𝑛=⟨𝑛𝑛|𝜌𝜌�em|𝑛𝑛⟩. 
Then Eq. ( S19) has the following form:  
𝜌𝜌⃗em(f)=𝑃𝑃�𝜌𝜌⃗em(i),      (S20)  
where 𝑃𝑃�𝑚𝑚𝑛𝑛=|𝑆𝑆𝑚𝑚𝑛𝑛|2. After the excitation by the first electron and before the second one, the collective 
emission  takes place  if all the necessary condit ions are satisfied17:

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑=−Γ𝑚𝑚(𝑁𝑁−𝑚𝑚+1)𝜌𝜌em𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚+Γ (𝑚𝑚+1)(𝑁𝑁−𝑚𝑚)𝜌𝜌em(𝑚𝑚+1)(𝑚𝑚+1).  (S21)  
Here Γ is the decay rate of a single emitter. Eq. ( S21) can be written in matrix form:  
𝑑𝑑𝜌𝜌��⃗em
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑=𝑀𝑀�𝜌𝜌⃗em,       (S22)  
with 𝑀𝑀�𝑚𝑚𝑛𝑛=−Γ𝑚𝑚(𝑁𝑁−𝑚𝑚+1)𝛿𝛿𝑚𝑚𝑛𝑛+Γ (𝑚𝑚+1)(𝑁𝑁−𝑚𝑚)𝛿𝛿(𝑚𝑚+1)𝑛𝑛. The solution of Eq. ( S22) is 
𝜌𝜌⃗em(𝑡𝑡)=𝑒𝑒𝑀𝑀�𝑑𝑑𝜌𝜌⃗em(0),     (S23)  
where 𝑒𝑒𝑀𝑀�𝑑𝑑 is the matrix exponent. If we have the pulse of 𝑁𝑁e electrons, then the density matrix as the 
function of time has the following form:  
𝜌𝜌⃗em(𝑡𝑡)=𝑒𝑒𝑀𝑀�𝑑𝑑⋅𝑃𝑃�𝑒𝑒𝑀𝑀�𝜏𝜏𝑃𝑃�𝑁𝑁e−1𝜌𝜌⃗em(0).    (S24)  
The intensity of emission in this process is described by:

 We can write the density matrix as a column 𝜌𝜌⃗em because o ff-diagonal terms of the emitter’s density 
matrix are zero during the process. The plot of Eq. ( S25) is shown in Fig. S12 . Eq. (S25) was also used 
to model the intensity in Fig. 1c and Fig. 3f in the main text.  
 
Fig. S12. The i ntensity of emission from a  cluster  of 𝑁𝑁 emitters triggered by free electrons. W e choose the 
simulation parameters close to the experimental  condition : interaction coupling of 𝑔𝑔=0.1, number of electrons 
of 𝑁𝑁e=12, single -emitter emission rate of  Γ=7.8⋅10−3 ps-1, and delay  𝜏𝜏 between consequent electrons of 1.5 
ps.  
According to Eq. ( S19), the electron excitation is instantaneous in time, which is a good 
approximation since the electron pulse duration ( ~1 ps) is much smaller than the superradiance 
emission time (~20 ps in the experiment). The “steps” in Fig. S12 arise from  the discrete nature of 
electrons and their instantaneous interactions . These features should be averaged out by the distribution 
of electron arrival times. In practice, the dominant averaging mechanism is  the finite response time of 
the measurement device, which averages over  these temporal features, resulting in Fig. S13 and in Fig. 
1b and Fig. 3b in the main text . All these effects can be modeled by the convolution of the intensity as 
a function o f time 𝐼𝐼 (𝑡𝑡) with a Gaussian of a finite width  𝜏𝜏0:

same parameters as in Fig. S4 , with an averaging Gaussian width of 𝜏𝜏0=5 ps. 
 Fig. S13 shows how our theory can match the temporal dynamics in the experiments. However, 
there is one assumption in constructing our theory  that is not precisely satisfied by most of the clusters 
in our experiment: The first condition in Eq. ( S11) – that the size of the cluster  is much smaller than the 
distance between the electron and the cluster (𝑑𝑑≪𝑟𝑟⊥) – is not satisfied.  Therefore,  the th eory we 
developed may be sufficient for the temporal dependence (as in Fig. S13), but can not precisely capture 
the spatial effects, which relate to  the size of the elect ron beam and to the size of the cluster . To build a 
time [ ps]intensity [a.u.]
time [ ps]intensity [a.u.]15 
 more accurate theory that can capture the spatial effects, we relax the condition 𝑑𝑑≪𝑟𝑟⊥ while still 
maintain ing 𝑑𝑑≪𝜆𝜆0 (where 𝜆𝜆0 is the wavelength of the emitted light) . These relaxed conditions can 
still support a type of  superradiance, as we discuss in  the next section . 
The spatial dependence of superfluorescence triggered by free electrons  
In this section, we consider the interaction of a finite -width electron beam with emitters that are  
spatially distributed  in a square lattice, similar to the experimental configuration . In this case, the 
effective area of electron excitation is smaller than the size of the cluster. Therefore,  the strength of the 
interaction is different for different emitters  in the cluste r. This condition is what makes free-electron -
driven superfluorescence so different than the more conventional light -driven superfluorescence. In the 
light- driven case, all the emitters within a  certain area experience the same excitation strength (this area 
is controlled by beam spot size, which is always larger or equal to the  wavelength ). In this case of light-
driven superfluorescence , the theory developed in the previous sections is  in good agreement with 
experiment s. However, electron -driven superfluorescence requires a more advanced theory, because 
the small size of the electron probe causes the excitation strength to vary substantially between different 
emitters. This spatial dependence provides another degree of freedom for research of superfluorescence, 
which could enable probing collective dynamics with resolution comparable and potentially smaller 
than the correlation distance. 
The formalism in this section  is developed to capture the spatial effects of electron -driven 
superfluorescence, and its dependence on the e lectron beam spot size. We consider a single electron 
that interact s with a square lattice  of emitters, with a distance between them of 12 nm, as depicted in  
Fig. S14a. According to Eq. ( S3), the probability of excitation is : 
𝑃𝑃e=sin2|𝑔𝑔(𝑟𝑟)|. 
Fig. S14a schematically shows the square lattice of emitters and the electron, which interacts with the 
lattice. Fig. S14b shows that a single electron cannot excite more than a single emitter since the effective 
interaction distance is smaller than a single QD emit ter for the values of the param eters in our 
experiment  (𝑔𝑔=0.1, distance between emitters = 12 nm, 𝑣𝑣/𝑐𝑐=0.1).

cannot create superfluorescence) . 
We consider a Gaussian  electron  beam  of 𝑁𝑁e electrons , as depicted in Fig. S15a, which is 
described by the transverse probability density

 where 𝜎𝜎  is the spot size of the beam. Now, let us calculate the excitation by a  Gaussian beam of many 
electrons. In this case, the electrons- material interaction constant changes to  the convolution of Eq. 
(S27) and Eq. ( S3): 
𝑃𝑃beam (𝑟𝑟)=∫𝜌𝜌(|𝒓𝒓−𝒓𝒓𝟎𝟎|)⋅sin2|𝑔𝑔(𝒓𝒓𝟎𝟎)|𝑑𝑑2𝒓𝒓𝟎𝟎∞
0.     (S28)  
𝜌𝜌(|𝒓𝒓−𝒓𝒓𝟎𝟎|) is the transverse probability d ensity of the e lectron beam described by Eq. ( S27). 𝑔𝑔(𝒓𝒓𝟎𝟎) is 
the interaction constant for a single  electron described by Eq. ( S3). Eq. (S28) can be simplified to

𝜎𝜎2� being  the modified Bessel function of the first kind.  
Fig. S15a depicts  the electron beam’s interaction with the sample. Fig S1 5b shows  the 
excitation by the electron beam (i.e., 𝑃𝑃beam (𝑟𝑟)). If just on e electron is used for the excitation, it cannot 
excite superradiance because it excites an  area smaller than the size of an emitter . i.e., despite the 
electron kinetic energy being sufficient to excite multiple emitters, this energy can only be transferred 
to a small area, and thus only a single emitter can be excited , resulting in no superfluo rescence. In 
contrast, an electron beam with a spot size 𝜎𝜎 larger than the size of the emitter ( 𝜎𝜎≫10 nm) , consisting 
of many electrons ( 𝑁𝑁e≫1), can excite multiple emitters (Fi g. S15b)  and in this way initiate 
superfluorescent emission. In the extreme case of  increasing the beam size further ( 𝜎𝜎>100 nm), while 
the number of electrons inside the beam stays constant, we find no superfluorescence due to the low 
density of ex citations,  as show n below.

The total number of excited emitters 〈𝑁𝑁exc⟩ as the function of beam size 𝜎𝜎  is shown in Fig. S16 . We 
can see that for beams with 𝜎𝜎≥10 nm (which is almost always the case), the averaged number of excited 
emitters no  longer  depend s on the beam size.

However, the number of emitters taking part in the superfluorescence does not equal 〈𝑁𝑁exc⟩. 
There is a finite distance  𝑅𝑅max within which emitters can correlate with each other18. Thus, 
approximately, only the emitters within a circle of radius 𝑅𝑅 max can simult aneously participate in 
superfluorescence, as schematically shown in Fig. 17a . Thus , the optimal e -beam size is a constraint 
both from below and from above.

For comparison, in the case of light- driven superfluorescence , the number of emitters 
participating in fluorescence is proportional to the fluence 𝐹𝐹ph [in units of μJ⋅m−2] of the ex citati on

where  𝜏𝜏SE is the time of emission from a single emitter (conventional sp ontane ous emission ), 𝛼𝛼 is a 
constant that depends on material  properties and not on the type of excitation, 𝜎𝜎ph is the cross -section 
parameter  of the interaction between light and emitters,  and Δ𝑡𝑡 is a delay connected with the 
measurement devi ces.  
In the case of free electrons, we can write the same formula but replace the fluence  of light  𝐹𝐹ph 
by a fluence parameter for the electrons 𝐹𝐹 e, which describes the energy delivered by the electron beam  
divided by the beam area. We define the cross -section parameter  𝜎𝜎e by the efficiency and area of the 
electron interaction , such  that 𝐹𝐹electorn⋅𝜎𝜎e (Fig. S17b)  gives the energy of excitons that translates to 
light emission inside the correlated area 𝜋𝜋 𝑅𝑅max2:

1+𝛼𝛼⋅𝜎𝜎e⋅𝐹𝐹e+Δ𝑡𝑡.     (S34)  
The results of Eq. (S34) are depicted in Fig. S18 and in Fig. 3a in the main text .  
 
Fig. S18.  Emission  time 𝜏𝜏SF as the function of electron  beam size,  according to Eq. (S34). To match with the 
experiment, we  take 𝜏𝜏SE=128 ps, and Δ𝑡𝑡=1 ps. 
The important prediction of Eq. (S34) is the limit of beam diameter for SF. When the beam is 
smaller than a single QD , it will not excite more than the QD that it is focused on , and no coherence 
will be built between individual QDs . In the case of a very large diameter of the beam, we will also not 
see coherence between the QDs since, most likely, the electrons will be too far from each other. 
However, in the case when the diameter of the beam is larger than a single quantum dot and smaller 
than the emitted wavelength , we know that we will see the  effect of superfluorescence  if there are 
enough electrons per pulse to excite multiple QDs . This property can be used to investigate the effects 
of superfluorescence  as a function of the  number of emitters , by continuously changing the size of the 
beam  to control the number of emitters  involved  in the process . 
Let us further note that with light excitation, it is often the case that multiple decay times should 
be averaged over (e.g.,20). Then, an exponential decay does not fit the data (a Gaussian decay is observed time ( ps)

 instead) . Our data fit s to a clear exponential decay, which is a strong indication of the dominance of a 
single 𝜏𝜏SF value. Physically, this means that the correlations force different emitters to decay 
simultaneously even when they experience different interaction coupling strengths . This makes sense 
for superfluorescence  (rather than superradiance)  because the excitation is highly incoherent , i.e., the 
phase is lost , and the correlations are all built only during the emission after the excitation strength is 
no longer important. Altogether, this implies that our experiment observes a unique phenomenon in 
which the emitters become indistinguishable during their emission, despite being distinguished on 
excitation .
