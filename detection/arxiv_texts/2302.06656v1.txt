ABSTRACT
Conversational recommenders are emerging as a powerful tool
to personalize a user’s recommendation experience. Through a
back-and-forth dialogue, users can quickly hone in on just the right
items. Many approaches to conversational recommendation, how-
ever, only partially explore the user preference space and make
limiting assumptions about how user feedback can be best incor-
porated, resulting in long dialogues and poor recommendation
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel conversational rec-
ommendation framework with two unique features: (i) a greedy
NDCG attribute selector , to enhance user personalization in the inter-
active preference elicitation process by prioritizing attributes that
most effectively represent the actual preference space of the user;
and (ii) a user representation refiner , to effectively fuse together the
user preferences collected from the interactive elicitation process
to obtain a more personalized understanding of the user. Through
extensive experiments on four frequently used datasets, we find the
proposed framework not only outperforms all the state-of-the-art
conversational recommenders (in terms of both recommendation
performance and conversation efficiency), but also provides a more
personalized experience for the user under the proposed multi-
groundtruth multi-round conversational recommendation setting.

25,30]. Rather than inferring from past user-item interactions,
a CRS directly engages with the user through a conversation to
learn the user’s current and fine-grained preferences. Such a con-
versational approach can provide recommendations that are both
highly personalized and justifiable. While several settings have
been proposed to formulate the task of conversational recommen-
dation, in this work, we focus on the multi-round conversational
recommendation (MCR) setting, which is widely perceived to be
the most realistic setting so far [ 2,12,17,30,34]. Under the MCR
setting, a conversational recommender system starts with the in-
teractive preference elicitation process in which the system explores
the preference space of the user, via asking the user’s preferences
on certain attributes (e.g., are you looking for country music?), to
obtain an accurate estimation of the user’s current interests. Based
on the learned preferences of the user, the system recommends the
top-𝑘items that best match the user’s current interests.
The MCR setting has shown promising results across many rec-
ommendation tasks (e.g., music recommendations [ 25,30], business
recommendations [ 12,13], and E-Commerce [ 2]), yet it makes a
strict assumption – that a user only has one target-item in mind
when interacting with the system. In reality, users often have di-
verse preferences which makes them simultaneously interested in a
wide variety of items [ 21,22,26,36]. Take music recommendations
as an example, while Alice likes the popstyle song ‘Shape of You’,
she also finds a country style song – such as ‘Somebody like you’
– enjoyable to listen. In this situation, designing and evaluating
a CRS with such a strong single-groundtruth assumption greatly
limits the generalizability of the system.
Hence, we extend the MCR setting to the multi-groundtruth
multi-round conversational recommendation (MGMCR) setting,
under which the CRS is designed and evaluated with the realistic
formulation that a user could be simultaneously interested in a
variety of items. This MGMCR setting is more challenging than
the traditional MCR setting, as the CRS now aims to discover all
the groundtruth items of the user. The key in achieving promis-
ing recommendation performance lies in the effectiveness of user
personalization in the system. Specifically, we identify two key chal-
lenges that existing works face under the MGMCR setting:
(1)lack of user personalization in interactive preference elicitation :
During the interactive preference elicitation process, a CRS aims to
explore a user’s preference space by asking the user’s preferencearXiv:2302.06656v1  [cs.IR]  13 Feb 2023WWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA Allen Lin, Ziwei Zhu, Jianling Wang, and James Caverlee
on a set of domain specific attributes. Since every user has unique
preferences, a CRS must prioritize on asking the attributes that the
user would consider relevant in expressing her actual preference
space. Although there are some differences among how existing
CRSs decide on which attribute(s) to prioritize for a specific user,
most of them rely heavily on the use of entropy , which does not
provide sufficient granularity for the system to identify the most
relevant attribute(s) for the user. Such an issue could even be exacer-
bated under the MGMCR setting given the user now has a broader
preference space. In turn, the asked attributes often result in a
sub-optimal representation of the user’s actual preference space,
resulting in poor recommendation performance.
(2)lack of user personalization in preference fusion : To achieve per-
sonalized recommendations for the user, a CRS must fuse together
the user’s preferences – collected in the interactive preference elic-
itation process – to form a personalized understanding of the user.
To do that, many existing works [ 2,12,13,30] have adopted the use
ofattribute-filtering in which the system treats every item that does
not align perfectly with the collected preferences as a mismatch for
the user. This approach has two limitations under the MGMCR set-
ting. First, many groundtruth items could be mistakenly considered
as mismatches. For instance, Alice is interested in both the action
movie, Top Gun: Maverick, and the comedy movie, Despicable Me.
So when the system asks Alice if she is looking for a comedy movie,
Alice will respond with a confirmation. However, with the attribute
comedy added to her set of collected preference, Top Gun: Maverick
would now be considered as a mismatch for Alice since it does not
contain the attribute comedy . Second, it does not take the user’s past
interests into consideration, overlooking the scenario where the
same preference could indicate different signals for different users.
For a user who has rarely watched horror movies, a confirmation
on the attribute horror could indicate a stronger shift in preference
compared to a user who has frequently watched horror movies.
To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel
framework for enhancing userpersonalization in conversational
recommendation systems (UpsRec). To enhance user personaliza-
tion in the interactive preference elicitation process, the framework
adopts an NDCG-oriented greedy attribute selection strategy in
which the system directly prioritizes on asking the attributes that
most effectively personalize the recommended items for each user.
And to enhance user personalization in fusing the collected user
preferences, the framework deploys a user representation refiner to
iteratively refine the initial user representation learned from past
interactions. With the refined representation being a more accurate
reflection of the user’s current interests, items no longer need to
be filtered to ease the difficulty of ranking, avoiding the scenario
of mistakenly excluding groundtruth items. In summary, the main
contributions of this work are as follows:
•We are the first to comprehensively study the MGMCR scenario
for conversational recommendation, which is more realistic and
generalizable than the existing MCR setting.
•We propose the UpsRec framework with unique features de-
signed to provide personalized experiences for the users and
effectively guide them to their items of interest.•We show the proposed UpsRec framework significantly outper-
forms state-of-the-art CRS methods by an average of 23%, while
requiring fewer interactions with the user.
2 PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we provide a brief introduction on multi-round
conversational recommendation (MCR), which is the most widely
adopted setting for conversational recommendation [ 2,12,13,30].
Formally, let 𝑉denote the itemset, and 𝑃=(𝑝0,𝑝1,...,𝑝𝑚)de-
note a set of 𝑚domain-specific attributes that describe an item
𝑣∈𝑉. During each conversation session, a CRS aims to first learn
the user’s fine-grained preferences on the asked attributes, then
provides personalized recommendations. A conversation session
starts by the user specifying an attribute 𝑝0contained in the target
item(s) that she is asking the system to find (e.g., Can you find me
some country music?). Next, a CRS calls upon its conversation com-
ponent to decide whether to ask the user more attributes or make a
recommendation. If the policy agent decides not enough preference
evidence has been collected, it will pick one attribute 𝑝from the set
of unasked attributes 𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑 to prompt the user. If the user likes the
asked attribute, then policy agent updates the set of collected pref-
erences of the user, 𝑃𝑢, by adding 𝑝to𝑃𝑢; otherwise 𝑃𝑢remains
unchanged. If the policy agent decides enough information has
been collected after 𝑡turns of interaction, the CRS then calls upon
its recommender component to make a list of recommendations.
The recommender component would then rank all the items in
the candidate itemset 𝑉𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑 – the itemset that contains only items
with attributes perfectly matching all specified preferences in 𝑃𝑢–
then recommends the top-K ranked items to display to the user. If
the user accepts the recommendation, then the system quits. If the
user rejects all the recommended items, the system first removes
the rejected item 𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑗from𝑉𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑 then repeats the cycle by calling
upon its conversational component to decide the next action to
take. This process continues until the user quits due to impatience
or a predefined maximum number of turns has been reached.
Multi-round Multi-Groundtruth Setting. Although MCR is cur-
rently perceived as one of the most realistic settings for conversa-
tional recommendation, it makes the limiting assumption that a
user only has one item of interest when interacting with the sys-
tem. Therefore, we propose the new multi-round multi-groundtruth
(MGMCR) setting, which makes the following changes: (1). when
being asked by the system on the preference towards an attribute 𝑝,
the user is now assumed to answer according to the attributes asso-
ciated with allher groundtruth items (i.e., can be one or multiple),
which more realistically mimics how a user would interact with
a CRS; and (2). the system now only generates one conversation
session for each user 𝑢, instead of a new conversation session for
each observed user-item interaction pair of the user.
3 PROPOSED FRAMEWORK
In this section, we introduce a novel framework for enhancing
userpersonalization in conversational recommendation systems,
namely UpsRec. UpsRec is designed to tackle two key challenges: (i)
how to bring user personalization to interactive preference elicita-
tion; and (ii) how to bring user personalization to preference fusion.Enhancing User Personalization in Conversational Recommenders WWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA
Specifically, we design a greedy NDCG attribute selector that per-
sonalizes the interactive preference elicitation process by utilizing
an NDCG-oriented attribute selection strategy to prioritize on at-
tributes that most effectively represent the actual preference space
of the user. Then, to effectively fuse together the user preferences
collected from the interactive preference elicitation process, a user
representation refiner is deployed to iteratively refine the current
representation of the user.
The framework starts with the latent interest estimation stage
where the system builds an initial predictive model to estimate the
interest of users by learning a set of latent representations from the
historical user-item interactions. Then a reinforcement learning
based policy agent, integrated with both the greedy NDCG attribute
selector and the user representation refiner , is deployed to decide how
to interact with the user. Together, the entire flow of the proposed
UpsRec framework is detailed in Algorithm 1.

3.1 Latent Interest Estimation
The goal of the Latent Interest Estimation stage is to learn an initial
set of latent representations for all users, items, and attributes – de-
noted respectively as R𝑈,R𝑉,R𝑃– that will later be used through-
out the framework. Following [ 12,13,29], we adopt a factorization
machine [ 23] (FM) as the predictive model. Given user 𝑢, the user’scollected preferences 𝑃𝑢, and an item 𝑣,𝑢’s predicted interest in 𝑣
is computed as:
𝑦(𝑢,𝑣,𝑃𝑢)=r𝑇
𝑢r𝑣+∑︁
𝑝𝑖∈𝑃𝑢r𝑇
𝑣r𝑝𝑖 (1)
where r𝑢andr𝑣respectively denote the latent representation of
user𝑢and item𝑣, and r𝑝𝑖denotes the latent representation for at-
tribute𝑝𝑖∈𝑃𝑢. As shown in [ 15], re-weighting an item’s relevance
based on its frequency in the training set results in more effective
learned latent representations. Therefore, we modify the standard
pairwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) objective function
[24] to a weighted variation as follows:
𝐿=1
𝑒𝑛1𝑓𝑖[−𝑙𝑛𝜎(𝑦(𝑢,𝑣,𝑃𝑢))−𝜎(𝑦(𝑢,𝑣′,𝑃𝑢))]+𝑒𝑛2𝑓𝑖||v||2
+𝜆^𝜃(||ˆ𝜃||2)(2)
where𝑒denotes the natural log; 𝑓𝑖denotes the interaction fre-
quency of the item 𝑣;1
𝑒𝑛1𝑓𝑖controls the relevance of the item 𝑣to
the loss function; and 𝑒𝑛2𝑓𝑖controls the scale of the regularization
on the item’s learned latent representation v. And𝑛1and𝑛2de-
note hyperparameters that control the impact of the interaction
frequency on 𝑣’s relevance and regularization scale, and 𝜆𝜃denotes
the regularization parameter to prevent overfitting.
3.2 Greedy NDCG Attribute Selector
Once the conversation begins, how do we personalize the elicita-
tion of a user’s preferences? To achieve this, we propose a greedy
NDCG attribute selector which utilizes an NDCG-oriented attribute
selection strategy to help the CRS identify the attributes that most
effectively represent the current preference space of the user. Since
the eventual goal of a CRS is to make accurate recommendations
for the user, we consider the effectiveness of an attribute equivalent
to how much it can increase the recommendation performance.
That is, after being asked by the system, how much can knowing
the user’s preference on that particular attribute contribute to the
refinement of the user’s recommendations? To this end, the NDCG-
oriented greedy attribute selection strategy identifies the attribute
with the highest expected increase in recommendation performance
(measured in NDCG), from the user’s unasked adjacent attributes
𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑, to ask the user. The workflow of the proposed greedy NDCG
attribute selector is illustrated in Algorithm 2.
It is worth noting 𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑 contains only the unasked adjacent
attributes of the user – attributes that are contained in the user’s
interacted items and have not been asked before – which signifi-
cantly reduces the search space [ 13]. To start, the attribute selector
takes in the initial representation of the user learned from past
interactions r𝑢0, the current representation of the user r𝑢𝑡, the set
of collected preferences of the user 𝑃𝑢, and the set of candidate
attributes𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑 as inputs. Then for every unasked candidate at-
tribute𝑝in𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑, we compute its expected NDCG gain. First, we
add𝑝to𝑃𝑢to simulate the scenario that the asked attribute, 𝑝, will
be liked by the user. Then based on the updated 𝑃𝑢, denoted as
ˆ𝑃𝑢, we use the user representation refiner to compute the refined
representation r𝑢𝑡+1which reflects the system’s understanding of
the user after knowing the user’s preference on 𝑝. Then, we use
r𝑢𝑡+1andr𝑢𝑡to compute the NDCGs of the user, both before andWWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA Allen Lin, Ziwei Zhu, Jianling Wang, and James Caverlee

after knowing the user’s preference on 𝑝, and use the difference
to serve as the expected NDCG gain for 𝑝. Once we have com-
puted the expected NDCG gains for all the candidate attributes in
𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑, we pick the attribute with the highest expected NDCG gain
to be asked next, 𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑘. It is important to note that the NDCG of
a user is computed on the validation set , instead of the testing
set. Specifically, we first rank all the items that are not included
the training samples of the user by taking the dot product of the
item’s representation (learned in Section 3.1) with the input user
representation . Then we use the ranked items of the user to compute
the DCG and the groundtruth items of the user (in the validation
set) to compute the Ideal DCG, which together give us the NDCG
of the user.
3.3 User Representation Refiner
After eliciting a user’s preferences, a natural next question is how
do we personalize the system’s model of the user? To provide a
personalized fusion for the collected preferences from the interac-
tive preference elicitation process, we deploy a user representation
refiner to refine the initial latent representation of the user, r𝑢0,
to be a more accurate reflection of the user’s current interests, by
considering the collected preferences of the user, 𝑃𝑢. Formally, we
have:
F(r𝑢0,𝑃𝑢)=ˆr𝑢
whereFdenotes the user representation refiner which maps the
initial representation of the user, r𝑢0, to the refined representation,
ˆr𝑢, based on the collected preferences of the user, 𝑃𝑢.
Input Layer: To fuse the collected preferences in a personalized
manner, the user representation refiner takes both the past and
thecurrent interests of the user, respectively encoded in r𝑢0and
𝑃𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑, into consideration. First to construct the inputs, we fetch,
from R𝑃(learned in Section 3.1), the latent representations of all
specified preferences in 𝑃𝑢, denoted as{r𝑝𝑖|1≤𝑖≤ |𝑃𝑢|}, and
stack them together into a matrix R𝑝𝑢∈R|𝑃𝑢|×𝑑, where𝑑is the
dimensionality of the latent representation.Preference Aggregation Layer: Then to account for the contex-
tual consistency of the neighboring preferences, an attention-based
preference aggregation layer is applied to R𝑝𝑢. Following [ 27], we
have:
ˆR𝑝𝑢=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(R𝑝𝑢W𝑞R𝑇𝑝𝑢W𝑘
√
𝑑)R𝑝𝑢W𝑣
where ˆR𝑝𝑢∈R|𝑃𝑢|×𝑑denotes a set of preference representations
refined by incorporating the contextual information of the neigh-
boring preferences. And W𝑞,W𝑘, and W𝑣denote the projection
matrices. Next, we apply the weighted-sum to aggregate all the re-
fined preference representations to construct a new representation
that comprehensively represents the collected preferences of the
user as an entity:
z𝑝𝑢=∑︁
𝑖∈|𝑃𝑢|𝛼𝑖·ˆr𝑝𝑖
where z𝑝𝑢denotes the aggregated representation that comprehen-
sively represents all the specified preferences in 𝑃𝑢as an entity;
ˆr𝑝𝑖denotes a particular updated preference representation in ˆR𝑝𝑢.
And𝛼𝑖is the weight learned by the vanilla attention network:
𝛼𝑖=r𝑇
𝑢0𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(W𝑐r𝑝𝑖+b1)𝛼𝑖=𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝛼𝑖)Í
𝑛∈𝑀𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝛼𝑛)
where𝛼𝑖is a scalar that represents the relevance of the representa-
tion of a particular attribute, ˆr𝑝𝑖,W𝑐is the projection matrix, and
b1is the bias vector. Note that the initial latent representation of
the user, r𝑢0, is directly used as the ‘query’ in calculation of 𝛼𝑖to
enhance personalization in the calculation of the relevance of a par-
ticular attribute, 𝛼𝑖, to the user. In this way, 𝛼𝑖is learned by taking
into account – (1) the intrinsic properties of individual attributes;
(2) the contextual consistency of the neighboring attributes; and (3)
the user’s general past interests – so that z𝑝𝑢is a comprehensive
representation of 𝑃𝑢.
Update Layer: Once z𝑝𝑢has been computed, we concatenate it
with the user’s initial latent representation, r𝑢0, to obtain a concate-
nated representation r𝑢𝑐𝑎𝑡that contains information of the user’s
past and current interests:
r𝑢𝑐𝑎𝑡=z𝑝𝑢⊕r𝑢0
Then, a one-layer feed-forward neural network is applied to obtain
the refined representation of the user ˆr𝑢:
ˆr𝑢=Wr𝑢𝑐𝑎𝑡+b2
where Wis the weight matrix of the neural network and b2is the
bias vector.
Objective Function: Since the intention of the user representa-
tion refiner is to enhance personalization in fusing the collected
preferences of the user ( 𝑃𝑢), the refined representation of the user,
ˆr𝑢, should have higher predicted affinity scores (calculated using
dot-product) with items that align well with 𝑃𝑢. To this end, we
adopt the standard pairwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective function for optimizing the user representation refiner as
a personalized ranking algorithm. Note we did not use the weighted
variation of the BPR loss, Equation (2), since it is not applicable in
this situation. Formally, we have:
𝐿𝑏𝑝𝑟=∑︁
(𝑣,𝑣′,𝑃𝑢)∈D−𝑙𝑛𝜎(ˆ𝑦(𝑢,𝑣,𝑃𝑢)−ˆ𝑦(𝑢,𝑣′,𝑃𝑢))+𝜆𝜃||𝜃||2Enhancing User Personalization in Conversational Recommenders WWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA
withˆ𝑦(𝑢,𝑣,𝑃𝑢)is computed as:
ˆ𝑦(𝑢,𝑣,𝑃𝑢)=F(r𝑢0,𝑃𝑢)𝑇v (3)
Here,Dis a set of pairwise instances for the BPR training, 𝑢is the
user whose embedding is being updated, 𝜎is the sigmoid function,
𝜆𝜃is the regularization parameter to prevent overfitting, r𝑢0is
the initial user representation, and Fis the user representation
refiner. Note, Equation (3) involves the use of Fin its computation,
which allowsFto be trained through back-propagation. In addition,
Equation (3) drops the second item-attribute affinity term used in
Equation (1). This is because the attribute information has already
been fused into the refined user presentation, ˆr𝑢, making the item-
attribute affinity term redundant.
Pairwise Instances Sampling: In this section, we introduce the
pairwise instances sampling strategy used to construct D, for train-
ing the user representation refiner. For each user 𝑢, we randomly
sample one of 𝑢’s interacted items to serve the positive sample,
𝑣. Then, we randomly keep 𝑛, where𝑇−1≥𝑛≥1(T being the
maximum allowed turns of interaction), attribute(s) from the 𝑣’s
list of attributes to serve as 𝑃𝑢. Lastly, we randomly sample one
of𝑢’s non-interacted items, whose attributes share a low Jaccard
Similarity with𝑃𝑢, to serve as the negative sample, 𝑣′. Compared
to the standard pairwise instance sampling where 𝑃𝑢would be𝑣’s
entire list of attributes, we randomly select n attributes to keep
the user representation refiner robust to a wide variety of attribute
combinations. Note, 𝑣′is specifically chosen to be an item that
share few attribute(s) with 𝑣to emphasize the importance of 𝑃𝑢.
3.4 Action Selection Policy Learning
Following [ 13], we adopt a two-layer feed forward neural network
as the policy network and use the standard Deep Q-Learning [ 19]
for optimization. As shown by previous works [ 2,13], massive
action space hinders both the training and the performance of
RL-based policy networks; thus, we define our action space to be
A={𝑎𝑎𝑠𝑘,𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑐}. During each interaction with the user, the policy
network takes in the state vector s𝑡and outputs the Q-values for
both𝑎𝑎𝑠𝑘and𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑐to be their estimated rewards. The CRS will then
choose the action with higher reward and interact with the user
accordingly. The state vector s𝑡is a concatenation of two vectors:
s𝑡=r𝑢0⊕sℎ𝑖𝑠
𝑡
where r𝑢0denotes the initial user representation, which is expected
to add personalization into the policy network, and sℎ𝑖𝑠
𝑡denotes the
conversation history up until turn 𝑡, which is expected to guide the
system to act more wisely – e.g., if multiple asked attributes have
been accepted, the system might be ready to recommend. Extending
from [ 13], we define the five kinds of rewards used for training
the policy network: (1) 𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐_𝑠𝑢𝑐, a NDCG-oriented positive reward
when recommendation succeeds; (2) 𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐_𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙, a negative reward
when the user rejects the recommendation; (3) 𝑟𝑎𝑠𝑘_𝑠𝑢𝑐, a slightly
positive reward when the user confirms the asked attribute; and
(4)𝑟𝑎𝑠𝑘_𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑙, a negative reward when the user rejects the asked
attribute, and (5). 𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑝, a strongly negative reward when reaching
the maximum number of turns.Table 1: Dataset statistics

4 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we showcase experiments over multiple datasets
to evaluate the performance of the proposed UpsRec approach to
answer three key research questions: RQ1 . How does the recom-
mendation performance of the proposed framework compare to
existing CRS approaches? RQ2 . Does the proposed greedy NDCG
attribute selector enhance user personalization in the interactive
preference elicitation process? RQ3 . Does the proposed user rep-
resentation refiner enhance user personalization in the preference
fusion process?
4.1 Experiments Setup
Dataset. We evaluate the proposed framework on four benchmark
datasets that are widely adopted to evaluate multi-round conversa-
tional recommender systems [2, 12, 13, 25, 30].
•Lastfm andYelp . Lastfm is a dataset used to evaluate music
artist recommendation and Yelp is used to evaluate business
recommendation. In [ 12], Lei et al. manually categorize the orig-
inal 8,432 attributes in Lastfm into 33 coarse-grained categories,
and construct a 2-layer taxonomy to reduce the original 590
attributes to 29 first-layer categories for Yelp.
•Lastfm*1andYelp*2. In [13], Lei et al. propose it is unrealistic
to manually merge attributes for practical applications, so they
adopt the original attributes for these two datasets. For a fair
comparison, we conduct experiments on both versions.
All datasets contain only the implicit (binary) feedback from the
user (e.g. whether a user has interacted with the item or not). Fol-
lowing previous works [ 6,12], we keep users with at least 10 inter-
actions to alleviate data sparsity. Statistics of all the datasets are
summarized in Table 1.
Baselines. To examine the proposed framework, we compare its
performance with the following start-of-the-art baseline conversa-
tional recommendation approaches.
•Matrix Factorization (MF) : MF is a collaborative filtering al-
gorithm that is widely used for many static recommendation
tasks. We report its performance to demonstrate the general
effectiveness of CRSs.
•Max Entropy (MaxEnt) : MaxEnt is a rule-based attribute se-
lection strategy. At each turn, the policy agent selects the at-
tribute with the highest entropy to ask. Recommendation is
made either when the candidate space is small enough, or the
policy agent runs out of attributes.
•CRM [25] : CRM is a CRS that uses a belief tracker to record
a user’s preference conveyed, and trains a policy network via

reinforcement learning to decide how to interact with the user.
We follow [ 12] to adapt it to the multi-round conversational
setting for fair comparison.
•EAR [12] : Similar to CRM, EAR also learns a predictive model
to estimate a user’s preference and trains a policy network to
determine whether to ask more attributes or make recommen-
dations. In addition, it also considers the feedback from the user
to further fine-tune the learned predictive model.
•SCPR [13] : Extending from EAR, SCPR leverages the concept
of adjacent attributes to construct a knowledge graph to reduce
the search space of attributes and uses Deep Q-Learning [ 19]
to learn a more efficient policy network.
•UNICORN [2] : Unicorn is the current state-of-the-art CRS. It
applies a dynamic-weighted-graph based RL approach to inte-
grate the conversation and the recommendation components
and deploys an weighted-entropy action selection strategy to
reduce the candidate action space.
Since all baselines are initially proposed under the MCR setting,
for a fair comparison, we retrain the conversational components
of all baseline models to adapt to the proposed MGMCR setting
as introduced in Section 2 and adopt a NDCG-oriented reward
function to optimize the policy networks of all baseline models.
Metrics. To evaluate a CRS under the MGMCR setting, we adopt
the Top-K metrics: Hit Rate (HT@K) and Normalized Discounted
Cumulative Gain (NDCG@K). HT@K could be considered as an ex-
tension of the widely adopted [ 2,12,25,30] Success Rate (SR) metric
under the MCR setting. Instead of measuring if the one groundtruth
item exists in the K recommended items, HT@K measures what
fraction of the K recommended items are of the groundtruth items.
To provide a more comprehensive evaluation, NDCG@K is also
adopted to account for the rank order in recommendations. In addi-
tion, we also report Average Turns (AT) to evaluate the efficiency
of the system. If the conversation session reaches the predefined
maximum turn T, then the turn count for the session is T.
Training Details. Following [ 12], we split the user-item interac-
tions in the ratio of 7:2:1 for training, validation, and testing, and set
the size of the recommendation list 𝑘to 10 and the maximum turn 𝑇
to 15. The training process is divided into offline and online stages.
The offline training is intended for building: (i) the predictive model
(FM) for estimating the latent interests of the user; and (ii) the user
representation refiner for incorporating the collected preferences
to iteratively refine the representation of the user. Afterwards, we
follow the user simulation process, introduced in Section 2, to con-
duct online training to optimize the policy agent (network) on how
to best interact with the user via reinforcement learning. We tune
all hyper-parameters on the validation set and set them as follows:
the dimensionality, 𝑑, of all the user, item, attribute representations
are set to 64. SGD is used for optimizing the weighted BPR loss
adopted in the predictive model used in Section 3.1, with 𝑛1set to 7,
𝑛2set to 8,𝜆set to .001. Adam is used for optimizing the standard
BPR loss adopted in the user representation refiner, with 𝜆set to
.002. For constructing the pairwise instance D, we collect 15,000
pairwise samples for each user with the Jaccard Similarity threshold
set to 0.33. For training the policy network, we set the experiencereplay memory size to 50,000, the sample batch size to 256, and the
discount factor 𝛾to 0.95.
4.2 Performance Comparison (RQ1)
As shown in Table 2, UpsRec significantly outperforms all the base-
line models in both recommendation performance (measured in
both NDCG@10 and HT@10) and conversation efficiency (mea-
sured in AT). This validates our hypothesis that enhancing user per-
sonalization, in both the interactive preference elicitation process
and the preference incorporation process, is an effective strategy
to build a CRS. We also make the following observations:
(1). All conversational recommendation approaches significantly
outperform the static matrix factorization (MF) model, showing the
promising functionality of CRSs in general.
(2). For all baseline models, we observe a significant gap between the
two recommendation performance metrics, especially on the Lastfm
and the Lastfm* datasets. In general, the measured NDCG@10 is
significantly lower than the measured HT@10. This is because
NDCG@10 is measured by taking the rank order of the groundtruth
items into account. Since baseline models only rely on attribute-
filtering to fuse the collected preferences of the user, the user repre-
sentation – used for ranking the candidate items to calculate NDCG
– is often not an accurate reflection of the user’s current prefer-
ence space, since it has never been updated after learned from the
past user-item interactions. As a result, even when the groundtruth
items can be successfully recommended, they are usually ranked
low on the recommendation list. Compared to the baseline models,
UpsRec show similar recommendation performance measured in
both NDCG@10 and HT@10. This is because UpsRec integrates
theuser representation refiner to iteratively update a user’s repre-
sentation whenever a new preference has been collected. In turn,
the user representation used for ranking the candidate items will be
a more realistic reflection of the user’s current interests, resulting
in groundtruth items being ranked higher on the recommendation
list when they are successfully recommended.
(3). Comparing to all other baseline CRSs, UpsRec shows consis-
tently higher conversational efficiency (measured by AT) and rec-
ommendation performance (measured by both NDCG@10 and
HT@10) across all four tested datasets, especially on the Yelp*
dataset. This indicates that UpsRec can scale up to both large at-
tribute spaces (8,432 attributes in Lastfm* v.s. 29 attributes in Yelp)
and larger number of user-item interactions (1,368,606 interactions
in Yelp* v.s. 76,693 interactions in Lastfm), which is critical for
deploying CRSs in practice.
4.3 Enhancing User Personalization in
Interactive Preference Elicitation (RQ2)
To determine whether the proposed greedy NDCG attribute selector
enhances user personalization in the interactive preference elicita-
tion process, we examine both the effectiveness and the efficiency of
the asked attributes in representing user’s actual preference space.
Since the goal of a CRS is to make highly personalized recom-
mendations, we consider the effectiveness of an asked attribute
equivalent to how much it can increase the recommendation per-
formance. As shown in Figure 1, knowing the user’s preferences on
the attributes – selected by the proposed greedy NDCG attributeEnhancing User Personalization in Conversational Recommenders WWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA

selector – brings significantly higher increments in recommen-
dation performance than knowing the user’s preferences on the
attributes selected by all the baseline CRSs. This indicates that the
proposed greedy NDCG attribute selector selects attributes that are
more relevant to the user, such that knowing the user’s preferences
on these attributes helps the system gain a more comprehensive
understanding of the user’s current interests. Next, we consider
the efficiency of the attributes selected by the greedy NDCG at-
tribute selector. From Figure 1, for UpsRec, we observe a strong
diminishing increase in recommendation performance after asking
five attributes. This indicates that the asked attributes are highly
efficient in representing the user’s actual preference space, suchthat knowing the user’s preferences on four asked attributes helps
the system to achieve roughly 80% of its best recommendation per-
formance on the Lastfm* dataset or nearly 90% on the Yelp* dataset.
Compared to UpsRec, all other baselines show marginal increases in
recommendation performance after knowing the user’s preference
on the first few asked attributes (Figure 1). This is due to the lack of
user personalization in the interactive preference elicitation. Com-
pared to the proposed NDCG-oriented attribute selection strategy,
the entropy-based attribute selection strategy adopted by exist-
ing works cannot precisely identify the set of attributes that most
efficiently represent the user’s actual preference space. To better
illustrate, we compare the averaged asking likelihood of the top-40
most frequently asked attributes in both UNICORN and UpsRec
(Figure 2). The asking likelihood of an attribute can be interpreted
as the percentage of users that the system predicts will find the
asked attribute relevant. For instance, the top-three most frequently
asked attributes in UNICORN have an average asking likelihood of
0.7. That is, UNICORN thinks that 70% of the users will consider
these three attributes important in expressing their preferences.
However, due to the lack of user personalization in the weighted-
entropy attribute selection, such prediction is often inaccurate. As
can be observed in Figure 2, UNICORN exhibits a higher asking
likelihood for almost all the top-40 most frequently asked attributes,
on both the LastFM* and the Yelp* dataset (Table 2). This indicates
that many of the asked attributes in UNICORN are inefficient in rep-
resenting the user’s actual preference space. A sample conversation
of such, on the Yelp* business recommendation dataset, is shown
in Figure 4. While the attributes Restaurant and affordable have
high calculated weighted-entropy, knowing the user preference on
them has virtually no contribution to the recommendation perfor-
mance of the system. Compared to the weighted-entropy attribute
selection strategy used in UNICORN, the proposed NDCG-oriented
attribute selection strategy identifies attributes that more efficiently
represent the preference space of the user.WWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA Allen Lin, Ziwei Zhu, Jianling Wang, and James Caverlee

4.4 Enhancing User Personalization in Fusing
Preferences (RQ3)
A personalized preference fusing process aims to consistently in-
crease the system’s understanding of the user by providing a per-
sonalized modeling based on the user’s collected preferences. There-
fore, to determine the effectiveness of the proposed user represen-
tation refiner in enhancing user personalization in the collected-
preference incorporation process, we examine whether the refined
representation of the user more precisely reflects the user’s actual
items of interest and attributes of interest, compared to the current
state-of-the-art CRS – UNICORN. To examine if the refined user
representation more precisely reflects the user’s actual items of
interest, we compare the AUC Scores on groundtruth item predic-
tion (computed following [ 24]) between UpsRec and UNICORN.
As shown in Figure 3, by iteratively refining the representation
of the user once a new preference of the user has been collected,
UpsRec’s AUC gradually increases as the conversation goes on.
Note UNICORN adopts a different strategy for learning the initial
user representations which results in different AUC scores at turn
0; however, since UNICORN (and all baselines) performs no refine-
ment on the learned initial user representations, its AUC remains
constant and is surpassed by UpsRec’s in one turn. This indicates
that compared to the attribute-filtering approach used in UNICORN,
the proposed user representation refiner is able to help the system
obtain a uniquely personalized modeling of the user, which more
precisely reflects the user’s items of interests. A similar pattern is
also observed in (Figure 3). As the conversation goes on, UpsRec’s
AUC on groundtruth attributes prediction also gradually surpasses
the AUC of UNICORN. Note, the AUC score on groundtruth at-
tributes prediction is computed by treating all the attributes that
exist in any of the groundtruth items as the positive attributes and
the attributes that do not as the negative attributes. A higher AUC
score indicates that the proposed user representation refiner is able
to help the system establish a more personalized modeling of the
user, which facilitates the process of identifying the attributes that
the user would find relevant in expressing her preference space.5 RELATED WORK
Traditional recommender systems challenges of (i) how to cap-
ture a user’s precise preferences; and (ii) how to provide a human-
interpretable justification for their recommendations [ 3,8]. Many
existing works have approached these challenges with auxiliary
data to better interpret user intentions [ 1,5,29,33,35]. In another
direction, the emergence of conversational recommenders that dy-
namically interact with users through real-time interactions are
able to elicit current and detailed preferences directly from users
[8]. In this way, a CRS can precisely learn a user’s interests along
with a series of actions that provide justification evidence.
In general, a CRS is composed of two components – the con-
versation component and the recommendation component. The
conversation component decides which action (further collecting
user preference or calling upon the recommender component to
make recommendations) to take during each interaction with the
user. The recommendation component learns a set of user, item,
and attribute embeddings for ranking all the candidate items. While
early works on CRSs primarily rely on template or choice-based
conversation components for collecting user preferences [ 4,9,41],
recent works have explored the possibilities of more effective pref-
erence elicitation methods and conversational strategies with the
help of reinforcement learning. For example, CRM [ 25] proposes a
deep reinforcement-based conversation component that builds a
personalized preference elicitation process. Inspired by CRM, EAR
[12] proposes a novel optimization function to enhance the rich-
ness of the embeddings learned by the recommendation component,
then designs a three-stage framework that further strengthens the
interaction between the recommender component and the conversa-
tion component. While sharing the same recommender component,
SCPR [ 13] integrates knowledge graphs to improve the reasoning
ability of the conversation component. Further utilizing the infor-
mativeness of knowledge graphs, UNICORN [ 2] proposes a dynamic
weighted graph based reinforcement approach that systematically
integrate the recommendation and the conversation components.
However, the above-introduced approaches [ 2,12,13,25,30] all
adopt an entropy-based attribute-selection strategy which limits
user personalization in the preference elicitation process. In addi-
tion, these approaches only make coarse uses of the obtained user
preferences, refraining the system from gaining a deeper under-
standing of the user. In this work, we propose a novel attribute-
selection and a preference fusion strategy that jointly address these
two issues. Note that while there are other research directions in
CRSs including dialogue understanding [ 10,14,28,37,40], response
generation [16, 18, 20, 39], and exploration-exploitation trade-offs
[7, 11, 31, 32, 38] those are not the focus of this work.
6 CONCLUSION
In this work, we propose a novel framework, named UpsRec, with
two unique features aiming to enhance user personalization in both
the interactive preference elicitation process and the preference
fusion process. The experimental results on four frequently adopted
conversational recommendation datasets show that the proposed
framework not only outperforms all baseline CRS methods but also
brings a more personalized experience for the user under the more
realistic and generalizable MGMCR setting.Enhancing User Personalization in Conversational Recommenders WWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA
