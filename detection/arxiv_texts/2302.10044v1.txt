Abstract
LetA/Qbe a Jacobian variety and let Fbe a totally real, tamely
ramiﬁed, abelian number ﬁeld. Given a character ψofF/Q, Deligne’s
Period Conjecture asserts the algebraicity of the suitably normalis ed
valueL(A,ψ,1) atz= 1 of the Hasse-Weil-Artin L-function of the ψ-
twist ofA. We formulate a conjecture regardingthe integrality proper-
ties of the family of normalised L-values (L(A,ψ,1))ψ, and its relation
to the Tate-Shafarevich group of AoverF. We numerically investi-
gate our conjecture through p-adic congruence relations between these
values.
1 Introduction
Deligne’s PeriodConjecturepredictsthatcertainfamilie sofspecialL-values,
after normalisation by appropriate periods, become algebr aic numbers and
moreover satisfy a natural Galois equivariance property. I n many settings of
interest, this conjecture constitutes a rationality predi ction for normalised
equivariant L-values.
In recent years, there has been much interest in the formulat ion and
study of integral reﬁnements of Deligne’s Period Conjectur e for the equiv-
ariantL-values that are associated to the base change of an abelian v ari-
ety through a Galois extension of number ﬁelds. We refer the r eader to
[1,2,3,4,5,11,12,15,20]. However, as far as we are aware, any theoretical
or numerical evidence obtained for such reﬁnements has been restricted to
the case of elliptic curves.

1The main purpose of this note is to formulate a conjectural in tegral
reﬁnement of Deligne’s Period Conjecture in the case of Jaco bian varieties
of curves of higher genus, and to investigate it numerically throughp-adic
congruence relations between normalised L-values of their Dirichlet twists.
In the case of elliptic curves deﬁned over Q, Deligne’s Period Conjecture
itself is now known to be valid thanks to existing modularity results (cf.
Remark 2.6below). However, the Jacobian varieties that we study do not ,
in general, correspond to a classical modular form.
To be a little more precise, we now let A/Qbe a Jacobian variety and F
be a totally real, tamely ramiﬁed, abelian number ﬁeld. Fix a lso a rational
primep. We will then identify simple and explicit conditions on A,Fandp
which we conjecture are suﬃcient for a canonical normalised equivariant L-
value ofA/F, belonging a priori to the complex group algebra C[Gal(F/Q)],
toinfactbe p-adically integral. Moreover, wepredictthat its(Galois) action
annihilates the p-primary Tate-Shafarevich group of AoverF.
We will study our explicit conditions through extended exam ples. We
will also provide extensive supporting numerical evidence for our conjecture
for Jacobians Aof curves of genus 2, base changed through number ﬁelds
Fof degreep. In these situations, we will also make the additional parti al
consequences of our integrality prediction fully explicit .
Before stating our conjecture (as Conjecture 1.1below), we will deﬁne
the relevant normalised L-values and brieﬂy recall the precise statement of
Deligne’s Period Conjecture.
1.1 Deligne’s Period Conjecture
In this section we recall the statement of Deligne’s Period C onjecture.
We letA/Qbe an abelian variety of dimension d. LetFbea totally real,
tamely ramiﬁed, abelian number ﬁeld, with Galois group G:= Gal(F/Q)
and character group /hatwideG:= Hom(G,C×). We denote the conductor of Fbyf
and we write Cfor the set of (rational) prime divisors of f.
Throughout this note, we will assume that the C-truncated Hasse-Weil-
ArtinL-series
LC(A,ψ,z) :=/productdisplay
ℓ∤fPℓ(A,ψ,ℓ−z)−1
ofAandψ, has an analytic continuation to z= 1. Here for each prime
numberℓand each character ψ∈/hatwideG, we have written Pℓ(A,ψ,t) for the
Euler factor at ℓforh1(A)⊗[ψ], as deﬁned in [ 15, Not. 15].
2We also associate the Gauss sum
τ∗(ψ) :=/summationdisplay
a∈(Z/fZ)×ψ(a)·ζa
f
to eachψ∈/hatwideG, withζf:= exp(2πi/f). By abuse of notation, here we
have written ψ(a) for the image under ψof the restriction to Fof the
automorphism of Q(ζf) given byζf/mapsto→ζa
f. We then set
LC(A,ψ) :=LC(A,ψ,1)·τ∗(ˇψ)d
Ω+
A,
whereˇψis the contragredient character of ψand Ω+
Ais the real period of A,
as deﬁned in [ 16, Section 2.4.2].
Deligne’s Period Conjecture, as formulated in [ 13], predicts for each ψ∈
/hatwideGa containment
LC(A,ψ)∈Q(ψ) (1)
and, in addition, the Galois-equivariance property
LC(A,g◦ψ) =g/parenleftbig
LC(A,ψ)/parenrightbig
(2)
for allg∈Gal(Q(ψ)/Q). HereQ(ψ) is the number ﬁeld generated by the
values ofψ. We refer the reader to the PhD thesis [ 16] of the ﬁrst named
author for details of how to relate these properties to Delig ne’s original
formulation.
1.2 An integral reﬁnement of Deligne’s Period Conjecture
Inthissection weformulatethemainconjectureofthisarti cle andwediscuss
some supporting evidence.
For eachψ∈/hatwideG, consider now the idempotent
eψ:=1
|G|/summationdisplay
g∈Gψ(g−1)g
ofC[G] atψ. It is then a straightforward exercise to verify that proper ties
(1) and (2) are valid for every ψin/hatwideG, if and only if the element
ΘC(AF) :=/summationdisplay
ψ∈/hatwideGLC(A,ψ)·eψ (3)
ofC[G] belongs to Q[G] (see, for instance, [ 1, Lem. 2.8]).
3Our numerical computations lead us to formulate the followi ng conjec-
ture, as a possible reﬁnement of Deligne’s Period Conjectur e for Jacobian
varieties.
Conjecture 1.1. Assume that Ais the Jacobian variety of a smooth, pro-
jective curve over Q, and has good reduction at all prime divisors of f. Fix
an odd prime number pthat does not divide the product f·|A(F)tor|.
Then the element ΘC(AF)deﬁned in ( 3)
(i) belongs to Z(p)[G], and
(ii) its action annihilates the p-primary Tate-Shafarevich group X(AF)[p∞]
ofAoverF.
In§2.2we will focus on the case where Fhas degree pand prime con-
ductor. In this setting, we will make fully explicit some par tial consequences
of the integrality prediction in Conjecture 1.1(i).
Remark 1.2. For ﬁxedA,Fandp, Conjecture 1.1simultaneously con-
stitutes a reﬁnement of the a= 0 case of Prediction 8.1 in [ 11], and an
extension of the a= 0 case of Prediction 8.4 in loc. cit., which was depen-
dent upon additional hypotheses on reduction types and rami ﬁcation. Let
us note in passing that the general framework of loc. cit. may be used to
relate Conjecture 1.1to the equivariant reﬁnement of the Tamagawa num-
ber conjecture of Bloch and Kato [ 6] that was formulated by Burns and
Flach in [ 10]. Conjecture 1.1is thus also closely linked to main conjectures
in Iwasawa theory, although we will not explicitly discuss t hese connections
here.
Remark 1.3. In fact, it would be possible to use the approach of [ 11]
to formulate an extension of Conjecture 1.1to more general number ﬁelds
F. However, if for instance the archimedean place of Qhas non-trivial
decomposition subgroup in G, then one would have to normalise each term
LC(A,ψ) by a diﬀerent period of A, depending on the parity of ψ. Also,
the presence of wildly ramiﬁed primes in F/Qwould require replacing each
Gauss sum τ∗(ψ) by a suitable ‘modiﬁed global Galois-Gauss sum’ of ψ. For
the computational purposes of this note, and the sake of simp licity, we have
thus elected to restrict attention to totally real, tamely r amiﬁed, abelian
number ﬁelds F.
We also refer the reader to Remark 3.5below for a discussion of the
weaker integrality propertiesforΘ C(AF)thatweexpecttoholdforJacobian
varietiesAthat have bad reduction at prime divisors of f.
4Although the purpose of this note is to provide numerical evi dence for
Conjecture 1.1in higher dimension, one may provide the following theoret-
ical evidence in support of Conjecture 1.1for elliptic curves A.
Theorem 1.4. LetA/Qbe an elliptic curve for which L(A/Q,1)/ne}ationslash= 0.
Then there exist inﬁnitely many primes p, and for each such p, there exist
inﬁnitely many ﬁelds F, satisfying the hypotheses of Conjecture 1.1, and
such that Conjecture 1.1is valid for A,Fandp.
Theorem 1.4follows upon combining the result [ 3, Cor. 1.4] of Bley with
the results [ 11, Thm. 6.5, Prop. A.1] of Burns and the second named author
and with the approach used to prove Thm. 8.6 in loc. cit. For br evity, we
omit the details of the proof.
Remark 1.5. Although the approach to proving Theorem 1.4outlined
above only produces extensions F/Qofp-power degree, it is possible to
replace the use of Bley’s result by the approach of [ 11,§11.2] to prove a ver-
sion of Theorem 1.4in which the degree of each extension F/Qis divisible
by arbitrarily many primes.
However, the approaches of both [ 3] and of [ 11,§11.2] rely crucially
on the theory of modular symbols. Therefore, although one ma y be able to
extendTheorem 1.4tohigher-dimensionalabelianvarieties thataremodular
(associated to a newform of weight 2), these methods cannot b e applied to
non-modular Jacobian varieties.
Integral reﬁnements of Deligne’s Period Conjecture simila r to that of
Conjecture 1.1, both for values of the form ( 3) and for analogous elements
constructed from derivatives of Hasse-Weil-Artin L-series, have also been
numerically investigated in the articles [ 1,2,4,5,12]. However, as alluded
to above, the investigations in these articles were underta ken exclusively for
elliptic curves, satisfying moreover stricter hypotheses on reduction types
than those that are in place in Conjecture 1.1.
In this note we provide extensive numerical evidence in supp ort of claim
(i) of Conjecture 1.1for Jacobian varieties of curves of genus 2, without
any additional restrictions on reduction types beyond the a ssumed good
reduction at all prime divisors of f.
We recall again that, through the general framework of [ 11], one may
show that our numerical evidence also supports aspects of th e equivariant
reﬁnement of the Tamagawa number conjecture of Bloch and Kat o [6] that
was formulated by Burns and Flach in [ 10].
Before stating our numerical evidence, we will brieﬂy expla in the kind
ofp-adic congruence relations that are encoded in Conjecture 1.1, and the
5consequences they canentail for thevanishingof p-primaryTate-Shafarevich
groups. We hope that this explanation will serve as a ﬁrst ste p, towards a
higher-dimensional exploration of the kind of ideas that we re applied in [ 15]
to study the arithmetic of elliptic curves. This will be the c ontent of §2.
Finally, §3 we dedicate to the numerical investigation of Conjecture 1.1.

2 Congruencerelations andTate-Shafarevich groups
2.1 The general case
The following result explains certain explicit consequenc es encoded within
Conjecture 1.1.
For any vector ( xψ)ψ∈/hatwideGof complex numbers and any g∈G, we set
Sg/parenleftbig
(xψ)ψ∈/hatwideG/parenrightbig
:=/summationdisplay
ψ∈/hatwideGψ(g)·xψ∈C.
Lemma 2.1. FixA,Fandpas in Conjecture 1.1. Then the following
claims are valid.
(i) Claim (i) of Conjecture 1.1holds if and only if for each g∈G, the
sumSg/parenleftbig
(LC(A,ψ))ψ/parenrightbig
belongs to |G|·Z(p).
6(ii) Assume that Conjecture 1.1holds, that
L(A,ψ,1)/ne}ationslash= 0
for everyψ∈/hatwideGand that for each g∈G, the sumSg/parenleftbig
(LC(A,ψ)−1)ψ/parenrightbig
belongs to |G|·Z(p). ThenX(AF)[p∞]vanishes.
Proof.Claim (i) holds because for any vector ( xψ)ψ∈/hatwideGof complex numbers,
the sum

ψ∈/hatwideGxψ·eψ=/summationdisplay
g∈G
|G|−1/summationdisplay

g∈G/parenleftbig

(xψ)ψ/parenrightbig/parenrightbig
·g−1
(4)
belongs to Z(p)[G] if and only if, for each g∈G, the sumSg/parenleftbig
(xψ)ψ/parenrightbig
belongs
to|G|·Z(p).
To prove claim (ii), we ﬁrst observe that the stated non-vani shing hy-
pothesis implies that
LC(A,ψ,1)/ne}ationslash= 0
for everyψ∈/hatwideG(note thatLC(A,ψ,1) andL(A,ψ,1) only diﬀer by ﬁnitely
many non-zero factors).
Given this fact, it is enough to show that the inverse
ΘC(AF)−1=/summationdisplay
ψ∈/hatwideGLC(A,ψ)−1·eψ
of ΘC(AF) inC[G], also belongs to Z(p)[G]. By (4), the latter condition is
valid if and only if, for each g∈G, the sumSg/parenleftbig
(LC(A,ψ)−1)ψ/parenrightbig
belongs to
|G|·Z(p).
Remark 2.2. The condition that
L(A,ψ,1)/ne}ationslash= 0
for everyψ∈/hatwideGis widely expected to hold, whenever the group A(F) is
ﬁnite.
2.2 Extensions of prime degree
Throughout the rest of this article, we assume given odd prim e numbersp
andqsuch that
q≡1 (modp).
7We then let Fbe the (totally real, tamely ramiﬁed) unique subﬁeld of Q(ζq)
that has degree poverQ.
The following result makes some of the partial consequences of the inte-
grality prediction in Conjecture 1.1fully explicit in this case.
Lemma 2.3. LetAbe the Jacobian variety of a smooth, projective, rational
curve. Assume that Ahas good reduction at q, thatL(A/Q,1)/ne}ationslash= 0and that
A(Q)contains no point of order p.
If claim (i) of Conjecture 1.1is valid forA,pandF, thenL{q}(A/Q,1)/Ω+
A
belongs to Z(p)and, for each non-trivial character ψofG, the following
claims are valid:
1. (i)Lq(A,ψ)belongs to Z(p)[ζp].
(ii)Lq(A,g◦ψ) =g/parenleftbig
Lq(A,ψ)/parenrightbig
for allg∈Gal(Q(ζp)/Q).
2.Lq(A,ψ)≡(−1)d·L{q}(A/Q,1)
Ω+
A/parenleftbig
mod (1 −ζp)Z(p)[ζp]/parenrightbig
.
Proof.We extend each character ψofGto a mapψ:C[G]→C.
By [1, Lem. 2.8], the element Θ q(AF) belongs to Q[G] if and only if for
eachψ∈/hatwideG, the element Lq(A,ψ) belongs to Q(ζp) and satisﬁes claim 1.
(ii).
If in addition Θ q(AF) belongs to Z(p)[G], as predicted by claim (i) of
Conjecture 1.1, then for any ψ/ne}ationslash=1one has
Lq(A,ψ) =ψ/parenleftbig
Θq(AF)/parenrightbig
∈ψ/parenleftbig
Z(p)[G]/parenrightbig
=Z(p)[ζp],
as required to prove claim 1. (i). After observing that τ∗(1) =−1, the
sameargumentappliedtothetrivialcharacterimpliesthat L{q}(A/Q,1)/Ω+
A
belongs to Z(p), as was claimed.
Now, for any XinZ(p)[G] and anyψ/ne}ationslash=1, one has
ψ(X)≡1(X) (modψ(Ip)),
whereIpdenotes the augmentation ideal in Z(p)[G]. Since
ψ(Ip) = (1−ζp)Z(p)[ζp],
the congruence claimed in 2. clearly follows from this fact, withXtaken to
be Θq(AF), and after observing again that τ∗(1) =−1.
Remark 2.4. The claim that L{q}(A/Q,1)/Ω+
Abelongs to Z(p)would be a
consequence of the p-component of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjec-
ture forA/Q(after observing that Pq(A,q−1) belongs to Z(p)).
8Remark 2.5. For eachψ∈/hatwideG, we have
Lq(A,ψ) =L{q}(A,ψ,1)·τ∗(ψ)d
Ω+
A.
Note that if ψis non-trivial, then qis totally ramiﬁed in the Artin ﬁeld of ψ.
Therefore, if Ahas good reduction at q, using the N´ eron-Ogg-Shafarevich
criterion, we ﬁnd
Pq(A,ψ,1/q) = 1,
and thus also
Lq(A,ψ) =L(A,ψ,1)·τ∗(ψ)d
Ω+
A. (5)
Remark 2.6. IfAis an elliptic curve, it follows from results of Shimura
[18], in combination with the modularity of A[21,19,9], that Deligne’s
period conjecture is valid for each twist of Aby a Dirichlet character ψ. For
an explicit statement of this claim, and a proof for some addi tional cases of
Artin representations, see the article of Bouganis and Dokc hitser [8].
Moreover, in this case, one further knows that the element Lq(A,ψ)
belongsto Z[ζp]foranynon-trivialcharacter ψofGwhichvalidatesStevens’s
Manin constant conjecture. For details of this assertion, s ee [20, Thm. 2
a)].
We note that such a containment is slightly stronger than the contain-
ment ofLq(A,ψ) inZ(p)[ζp] that is encoded in Conjecture 1.1, and that our
numerical computations in §3below have conﬁrmed this stronger integrality
property in all appropriate examples of Jacobian varieties .
3 Numerical Evidence
In this section we will provide both extended examples and da ta in support
of the explicit predictions discussed in previous sections .
Before we provide the examples, let us note that all calculat ions were
carried out in MAGMA [ 7] with the precision set to at least 10, and that all
(untruncated) L-values were computed using the algorithm of T. Dokchitser
[14]. To determine the L-value, note that Z[ζp] can be identiﬁed with a
discretesubgroup of Cp−1and in this way we can test whether the modiﬁed
L-value is close to a point in the image of Z[ζp].
We also stress that many of these computations are subject to our as-
sumption that the corresponding L-series admit an analytic continuation to
z= 1.
9To numerically verify the full extent of Conjecture 1.1for examples of
triples (A,F,p) for which the p-primary Tate-Shafarevich group of Aover
Fdoes not vanish, such as those discussed in §3.1.2below, one would have
to explicitly determine the Galois structure of this group. This seems, to
us, to be a very delicate problem in any example. Nevertheles s we will
attempt to return to this problem in future work, and we expec t that the
data provided in the tables below will be helpful to carry out such full
numerical veriﬁcations.
3.1 Explicit examples
We ﬁrst provide an explicit illustration of claim (i) of Conj ecture1.1.
Example 3.1. (p= 5, q= 11) LetAbe the Jacobian variety of the genus
2 curve given by the equation
y2+(x3+1)y=x5−x4−5x3+4x2+4x−4,
with LMFDB label 427.a.2989.1. We ﬁnd good reduction at 11, a nd no
non-trivial 5-torsion points in A(Q).
We letFbe the degree 5 subﬁeld of Q(ζ11) and letσdenote the auto-
morphism of Q(ζ11) deﬁned by σ(ζ11) =ζ2
11. We abuse notation and denote
byσits restriction to F. We then let ψjbethelinear character on Gal( F/Q)
mappingσtoζj
5.The Dirichlet character corresponding to ψjis the unique
group homomorphism ( Z/11Z)×→C×that maps 2 to ζj

L11(A,ψ3)≈2(ζ5+ζ2
5) =:α3, L11(A,ψ4)≈2(ζ5+ζ3
5) =:α4.
where ‘≈’ means ‘equal to 10 signiﬁcant ﬁgures’.
We ﬁnd that Θ 11(AF) belongs to Z(5)[G], and thus that claim (i) of
Conjecture 1.1is valid. Explicitly,
Θ11(AF) =2
7·112/parenleftbig
−(2·132)(1+σ+σ4)+509(σ2+σ3)/parenrightbig
.
10Let us ﬁnally make explicit the congruences given in claim 2. of Lemma
2.3. On the one hand we have
α1=−2(1+ζ5+ζ3
5) = 2(1 −ζ5)(2+ζ5+ζ2
5)−6
≡ −1/parenleftbig
mod (1 −ζ5)Z(5)[ζ5]/parenrightbig
,
whilst on the other hand, we have
α0≡23
2·12/parenleftbig
mod (1 −ζ5)Z(5)[ζ5]/parenrightbig
≡ −1/parenleftbig
mod (1 −ζ5)Z(5)[ζ5]/parenrightbig
.
One readily computes that α2,α3andα4are also congruent to −1.
3.1.1 Failure of the integrality claim
Let us now give some examples where the hypotheses of Conject ure1.1fail
to hold, and so does its integrality claim.
Example 3.2. (p= 3, q= 7) LetAbe the Jacobian variety of the genus 2
curve given by the equation
y2+(x3+1)y=−2x4+4x2−9x−14
with LMFDB label 294.a.8232.1. Then Ahas both bad reduction at 7 and
points of order 3 over Q.
LetFbe the degree 3 subﬁeld of Q(ζ7) and letσbe the automorphism
ofQ(ζ7) deﬁned by σ(ζ7) =ζ2
7. We abuse notation and denote by σits
restriction to F. Letψto be the linear character of Fmappingσtoζ3.
We compute
L7(A,1) =1
72andL7(A,ψ) =−(1+2ζ3).
We thus ﬁnd
Θ7(AF) =1
3·72/parenleftbig
1−(2·73)·σ+(22·37)·σ2/parenrightbig
/ne}ationslash∈Z(3)[G].
Let us also note that L7(A,ψ) =−(1 + 2ζ3) =−ζ3(1−ζ3) but that
L7(A,1) is not congruent to 0 modulo (1 −ζ3), so the congruence in claim
2. of Lemma 2.3also fails to hold.
Example 3.3 (p= 3, q= 7).We use the notation of Example 3.2. The
elliptic curve E/Qwith Cremona label 27a3 has good reduction at 7, but
does have points of order 3 over Q.
11We compute
L7(E,1) =−1
7andL7(E,ψ) = 1.
We thus ﬁnd
Θ7(EF) =1
3·7/parenleftbig
13−23·σ−23·σ2/parenrightbig
/ne}ationslash∈Z(3)[G].
Example 3.4 (p= 3, q= 7).We use the notation of Example 3.2. The
elliptic curve E/Qwith Cremona label 147b1 has no non-trivial 3-torsion
overQ, but does have bad reduction at 7.
We compute
L7(E,1) =−1 and L7(E,ψ) =7
13.
We thus ﬁnd
Θ7(EF) =1
3·13/parenleftbig
1−20·σ−20·σ2/parenrightbig
/ne}ationslash∈Z(3)[G].
Remark 3.5. Eveninthe(non-equivariant)settingoftheBirchandSwinn erton-
Dyer Conjecture, thepresenceof p-torsion rational pointsleads to thefailure
of integrality at pfor normalised L-values.
LetA/Qbe a Jacobian variety such that A(Q)[p] = 0 but which has
bad reduction at the ramiﬁed place q. Then the classical periods and Gauss
sums occurring in the deﬁnition of Θ q(AF) can diﬀer from the determinants
of canonical ‘ K-theoretical periods’ that occur naturally in the formulat ion
of reﬁned conjectures of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer type (se e [11]). In our
speciﬁc setting, such a diﬀerence is bounded by a factor of pd(times a
rationalp-adic unit).
In this case, it would therefore be natural to expect that, af ter multi-
plication by the additional factor pd, the element Θ q(AF) would belong to
Z(p)[G].
Such an expectation is consistent with our numerical comput ations but,
since it does not necessarily pin down the sharpest possible bound on the
denominators at pthat can occur in Θ q(AF), we leave its preciseformulation
and its thorough numerical investigation to future work.
3.1.2 Non-vanishing p-primary Tate-Shafarevich groups
We ﬁnally provide some examples for which claim (i) of Conjec ture does
hold, but the p-primary Tate-Shafarevich group of AoverFdoes not van-
ish. In all such instances, we have found that the condition o n the sums
12Sg/parenleftbig
(LC(A,ψ)−1)ψ/parenrightbig
that is stated in Lemma 2.1(ii) fails to hold. There-
fore, the non-vanishing of X(AF)[p∞] does not provide a counterexample
to claim (ii) in Conjecture 1.1.
Example 3.6. (p= 5, q= 11) We use the notation of Example 3.1. The
elliptic curve E/Qwith Cremona label 1246b2 has good reduction at 11 and
no 5-torsion over Q. The analytic order of X(EF) is 625 = 54.
We compute
L11(E,1) =−300

L11(E,ψ1) =−8ζ3

Example 3.7. (p= 3, q= 13) The elliptic curve E/Qwith Cremona label
448c5 has good reduction at 13 and no non-trivial 3-torsion over Q. The
analytic order of X(EF) is 729 = 36.

ofQ(ζ13)deﬁnedby σ(ζ13) =ζ2

133.2 Further numerical evidence
In this section we will provide a guide to the tables in the fol lowing section.
LetSbe the set of pairs ( p,q) of odd primes
{(3,7),(3,13),(3,19),(3,31),(5,11),(5,31),(7,29)},
which all satisfy q≡1 modp,letFp,qbe the degree psubﬁeld of Q(ζq) and
writeG= Gal(Fp,q/Q).For each of the 38 abelian varieties Aof conductor
at most 500 that arise as Jacobians of genus 2 curves over Qthat are listed
in the LMFDB [ 17] and each pair ( p,q)∈S,we calculated the p-tuple of
modiﬁedL-values/parenleftbig
Lq(A,ψ) :ψ∈/hatwideG/parenrightbig
.
For presentational reasons, we only list one member of the ab ove tuple
in the tables below; however, all L-values were computed independently of
one another. Moreover, by Lemma 2.31. (ii), if the congruence relation in
claim 2. of Lemma 2.3holds for one non-trivial character ψ∈/hatwideG, then it
follows for allnon-trivial linear characters.
We remark that some of the curves listed below give rise to iso genous
Jacobian varieties and so their (unmodiﬁed) L-values are equal. However,
the hypothesis on the rational p-torsion subgroups in Lemma 2.3isnot
isogeny-invariant. Indeed, we see from Table 2below that, if A(resp.A′)
is the Jacobian variety of curve 277.a.277.1 (resp. 277.a.2 77.2), then Aand
A′are isogenous but A(Q)[3] has order 3 whereas A′(Q)[3] is trivial and,
as the table shows, the congruence relation in claim 2. of Lem ma2.3is
(numerically) false for Aand (numerically) true for A′.
3.2.1 How to read the tables
Note that we are using the same curve-labels as those used in t he LMFDB
[17]. We write NAfor the conductor of Ain each case.
Thetables belowarecolour-coded sothat Lemma 2.3canbeveriﬁed‘at a
glance’. Columns 2, 3 and 7 represent the hypotheses q∤NA,p∤|A(Q)tors|,
and integrality of Θ Crespectively, and are coloured blueif they are not
satisﬁed (with ‘N’ for no in column 7). Columns 4, 5 and 6 repre sent the
conclusions and are coloured redif they do nothold. More precisely, we
writepfor the prime ideal (1 −ζp)Z[ζp] ofZ[ζp] and ord pfor the normalised
p-adic valuation on Q(ζp). Then column 6 (headed ‘ord p’) denotes
ordp/parenleftbigg
Lq(A,ψ)−L{q}(A/Q,1)
Ω+
A/parenrightbigg
.
14In terms of this colour-coding, Lemma 2.3can be rephrased as follows:
1)columns 2, 3 and 7 are black ⇒column 4 is black ,
2.i)column 2, 3 and 7 are black ⇒column 5 is black ,
3)columns 2, 3 and 7 are black ⇒column 6 is black .
Conversely, we can rephrase Conjecture 1.1i) as follows
•columns 2 and 3 are black ⇒column 7 is black .
