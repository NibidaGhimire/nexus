Abstract
There is a global trend to increase the light yield of CsI scintillators used in neutrino and dark matter detection by operating un-
doped crystals at cryogenic temperatures. However, high light yield alone is not su fficient to guarantee a low-energy threshold. The
response of undoped crystals to nuclear recoils at cryogenic temperatures is equally important. A liquid nitrogen-based cryostat
was developed to measure the nuclear quenching factor of a small undoped CsI crystal using monoenergetic neutron beams at the
Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL). To avoid neutron scattering in high- Zmaterials, these materials were intention-
ally reduced around the crystal. The structure and performance of the cryostat are described in detail. Using this cryostat, a light
yield of 33.4±1.7 photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent (PE /keV ee) was observed at 5.9 keV ee, enabling the measurement of
nuclear quenching factors at very low energies. The results of the quenching factor measurement will be reported in a subsequent
paper.
Non-negligible negative overshoot was observed in the tails of the observed light pulses. The origin of this issue and the correction
procedure are described in detail. This information may be useful for others who encounter similar technical challenges.

1. Introduction
Undoped cesium iodide (CsI) crystals at around liquid ni-
trogen temperature are very bright scintillators [1–3]. When
combined with photo-sensors working at cryogenic tempera-
tures, the light yield of these crystals can be at least twice as
high as that of Tl- or Na-doped CsI operated at room temper-
ature [4]. The light yields of undoped CsI crystals from SIC-
CAS, AMCRYS, and OKEN, with various sizes, from 13 keV
to 2.6 MeV , and directly coupled with PMTs or SiPMs at liquid
nitrogen temperature were systematically examined [5–9]. The
highest light yield obtained was 43.0 PE /keV ee, achieved with
a small crystal coupled to two SensL J-series SiPMs [9].
With such high light yields, the energy threshold of this de-
tector can be significantly lower than that of a doped CsI de-
tector. A 14.6 kg Na-doped CsI detector was used by the CO-
HERENT Collaboration to observe 134 ±22 coherent elastic
neutrino(ν)-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) events with two years
of operation at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), in the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) [4]. Assuming a similar
configuration and exposure, nearly 1350 CEvNS events are ex-
pected with a high light yield undoped CsI detector operated
at liquid nitrogen temperature. Sensitivities of such a detec-
tor for probing non-standard neutrino interactions [10–17] and
low-mass dark matter particles [18–25] are discussed in detail
in Ref. [6, 8].
Those sensitivity studies were based on the assumption thatundoped crystals at 77 K have a similar nuclear scintillation
quenching e ffect to undoped ones at room temperature. A re-
cent study at 108 K [26] confirmed this assumption. However,
measurements done with αparticles [27] revealed strong tem-
perature dependence of the quenching e ffect. It is therefore im-
portant to measure the nuclear quenching e ffect closer to 77 K.
The nuclear quenching measurement is normally done by
putting the material under study in a neutron beam. The energy
of the nuclear recoil can then be calculated from the energy of
the incident neutron and the angle of the scattered neutron, as-
suming the neutron only scatters once within the target. High Z
material should therefore be avoided around the target to mini-
mize the occurrence of neutron multiple scatterings.
A liquid nitrogen cryostat with low- Zmaterial around a small
undoped CsI crystal was developed for the nuclear quenching
measurement. Its performance was compared to another cryo-
stat previously used for light yield measurements.
A constant light yield was assumed in those sensitivity calcu-
lations. It is known, however, that the light yield of undoped CsI
has non-negligible variations at di fferent energy ranges, and it
varies with crystals under investigation [28–30]. It is hence nec-
essary to verify that the light yields we achieved from 13 keV to
2.6 MeV still hold at lower energies with our crystals purchased
from Japan and Ukraine. A55Fe source and an241Am source
were used to achieve this utilizing 5.9 keV x-rays and 60 keV
γ-rays.

2.1. Design based on gravity-fed liquid nitrogen dewar
Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup for the measurement of
the light yield of an undoped CsI crystal at around 77 K. As seen
in the right figure, liquid N 2can drip from a dewar into a hollow
pipe that is directly in contact with structures to be cooled. In
the detector mounting mode, as shown in the left figure, the
dewar can be taken away and this new cryostat can be flipped
over and placed into a dry glove box for crystal mounting. The
middle figure is the CAD drawing of the cryostat.
Figure 1: A sketch and photos of the cryostat setup.
The undoped cylindrical crystal was purchased from AM-
CRYS [31], and had a diameter of 1 inch and a height of 3 cm.
All surfaces were mirror polished. The side surface and an end
side surface of the crystal were wrapped with multiple layers of
Teflon tape to make sure that there was no light leak. A Hama-
matsu 3-inch R11065-ASSY PMT was pushed against the other
end surface of the crystal by springs to ensure adequate optical
contact without optical grease. The springs are held by the cop-
per base. The wrapped end surface of the crystal was pushed
against the cooling finger of the cryostat where liquid nitrogen
was fed into the LN 2pipe.
To control a reasonable radiation intensity, an241Am source
and an55Fe source were facing opposite towards the center of
the crystal. Two layers of aluminum foil were put on the55Fe
source to further reduce the radiation intensity. The sources
were attached to the inner side surface of the aluminum cham-
ber (IR shield) in the cryostat.
To minimize exposure of the crystal to atmospheric moisture,
assembly was done in a glove bag flushed with dry nitrogen gas.
The relative humidity was kept below 10% at 22◦C during the
assembly process.
The PMT-crystal assembly was capped by an IR shield that
was fixed to the copper base by three screws. The cryostat
was then sealed by the vacuum cap to a 6-inch ConFlat (CF)
flange. A fluorocarbon CF gasket was put in between for multi-
ple operations. The inner diameter of the cryostat was ∼10 cm.
Vacuum-welded to the flange were two BNC, two SHV , one
19-pin electronic feedthroughs.After all cables were fixed beneath it, the top flange was
closed. The chamber was then pumped with a Pfei ffer Vac-
uum HiCube 80 Eco to ∼1×10−5mbar. The feeder was then
filled with LN2 to cool the LN 2pipe, then further cool every-
thing inside. The pump was on all the time until the end of the
experiment.
A few Heraeus C 220 platinum resistance temperature sen-
sors were used to monitor the cooling process. They were at-
tached to the side surface of the crystal, the PMT, and the top
flange to obtain the temperature profile of the long chamber. A
Raspberry Pi 2 computer with custom software [32] was used
to read out the sensors. The cooling process to 77 K took about
10 hours. Most measurements, however, were taken after about
an additional 2 hours of waiting to let the system reach thermal
equilibrium.
The PMT was powered by a CAEN N1470A high voltage
power supply in a NIM crate. The signals were fed into a CAEN
DT5751 waveform digitizer, which had a 1 GHz sampling rate,
a 1 V dynamic range and a 10 bit resolution. WaveDump [33], a
free software provided by CAEN, was used for data recording.
The recorded binary data files were converted to CERN ROOT
files [34] for analysis by a custom-developed software [35].
2.2. Design based on open liquid nitrogen dewar
It is possible to measure the temperature of the crystal at-
tached to the liquid nitrogen pipe by attaching temperature sen-
sors around the side surface of the crystal. However, it is very
hard to maintain a good thermal contact between the sensor and
the crystal without some mechanism to push the sensor tightly
against the surface. Such mechanism would unavoidably intro-
duce extra material around the crystal, which may scatter neu-
trons in a quenching factor measurement. Instead, we compared
light yields of undoped crystals operated in this cryostat and an
old cryostat used in our previous light yield measurements to
ensure that the crystal was operated at 77 K. The structure of
the old crystal is shown in Fig. 2. As the crystal is fully sub-
merged in liquid nitrogen in this cryostat, its temperature is ex-
actly 77 K. If the light yields measured in the two are similar,
the crystals should have been operated at similar temperatures.
Note that the two crystals used in the two cryostats are dif-
ferent in shape, which might create a di fference in light collec-
tion e fficiency. However, because they are all very small, paths
of individual photons in them (in the order of centimeters) are
much shorter than the average absorption length (in the orders
of meters) in CsI. The light collection e fficiency hence cannot
be too di fferent in the two measurements.
The detailed description of the old cryostat can be found in
Ref. [7]. An undoped cylindrical crystal with a diameter of
5.08 cm and a height of 1 cm purchased from OKEN [36] was
used in the old setup. Another di fference is the radiation shield-
ing. As shown in the right Fig. 2, the old setup has a 1 mm
copper in between the241Am and the crystal, and two more lay-
ers of aluminum foil in between the55Fe and the crystal. The
sources are directly attached to the surface of the Teflon tape
wrapping.
The same analysis was made on two setups. Only analysis
from the new setup is presented here.

3. Single-photoelectron (SPE) response of the PMT
The SPE response of the PMT was measured using light
pulses from an ultraviolet LED, LED370E from Thorlabs. Its
output spectrum peaked at 375 nm with a width of 10 nm, which
was within the 200 – 650 nm spectral response range of the
PMT. Light pulses with a ∼50 ns duration and a rate of 10 kHz
were generated using a RIGOL DG1022 arbitrary function gen-
erator. The intensity of light pulses was tuned by varying the
output voltage of the function generator so that only one or zero
photons hit the PMT during the LED lit window most of the
time. A TTL trigger signal was provided by the function gen-
erator simultaneously with each output pulse, then was used to
trigger the digitizer to record the PMT response.
The PMT was biased at 1,600 V , slightly above the recom-
mended operation voltage, 1,500 V , to increase the gain of the
PMT. Single-PE pulses were further amplified by a factor of ten
using a Phillips Scientific Quad Bipolar Amplifier Model 771
before being fed into the digitizer in order to separate signals
from the pedestal noise.
Figure 3: 209 selected waveforms from the PMT overlapped with each other.
The left plot on Fig. 3 shows ∼210 randomly selected wave-
forms from the PMT response of the SPE measurement. Some
quality criteria were applied to filter out noise events. Firstly,the baseline was calculated in the following steps. The values
corresponding to each sample (height) were added to a summed
value, then an averaged value (baseline value) was calculated
using the summed value divided by the number of samples. The
baseline value was then used to shift the waveforms to zero by
deducting this baseline value from each corresponding height
value. Secondly, the root mean square (RMS) of the baseline
was also calculated. After that, averaged baseline values and
RMS of the baseline were calculated in a region of 0 to 100
ns, 180 to 280 ns and 400 to 500 ns and all RMS were re-
quired to be smaller than 1 ADC count to obtain a relatively
stable baseline. The averaged baseline values in the latter two
regions were also set to be lower than 1 ADC count to filter out
some low-frequency fluctuation events. Another restriction was
that the lowest point of the waveform should be greater than −2
ADC counts. Eventually, 209 SPE waveforms were selected
applying those restrictions to 1300 SPE events. However, some
fluctuations still exist in the pedestal which sits under the SPE
waveforms.
Figure 4: A random SPE waveform, averaged SPE waveform and averaged
pedestal waveform.
To examine the influence of the unstable pedestal on the
SPE waveforms, the averaged SPE waveforms and the averaged
pedestal waveform were studied as shown in the right plot on
Fig. 4. The averaged SPE waveform is correlated with the av-
eraged pedestal waveform; the baseline and averaged SPE co-
incide with each other except in the region where SPE initiates.
Therefore, the mean area of the SPE can be obtained by sub-
tracting the area of the averaged pedestal waveform from the
area of the averaged SPE waveform. The integration window
starts from and ends on both pulses crossing zero as shown in
the plot. However, SPE waveforms were seen to have much
higher heights in the left plot, yet the averaged SPE waveform
only has a height of ∼5 ADC counts in the right plot. To investi-
gate the discrepancy, we randomly selected an SPE waveform,
which was much narrower than the averaged waveform. The
wider width of the averaged waveform was due to the fact that
the SPE pulses appeared at di fferent locations, ranging from ap-
proximately 300 to 360 ns.
The integration window (283-416 ns) shown in Fig. 4 and
3Figure 5: SPE events of the PMT in logarithm scale. The titled peaks are
explained in the text.
the same cuts applied to the selected waveforms were then used
for each waveform in the data file. The resulting SPE spec-
trum is shown in Fig. 5. The spectrum was fit in the same way
as described in Ref. [7, 37]. The red Gaussian curve is fit for
the pedestal events, the blue Gaussian curve is fit for the SPE
events, and two-PE (green curve) and three-PE fit (pink curve)
were Gaussian functions based on the mean and sigma obtained
from the SPE fit. The black curve is the sum of those fit results,
which matches well the single PE response. The area of sin-
gle PE (mean SPE) would be, as mentioned above, mean SPE=
mean - m 0, where mean and m 0are obtained from the fit result
in Fig. 5. The value of mean SPEis 152.04 ADC counts ·ns, and
the value of m 0is 31.00 ADC counts ·ns. These values will be
further used in the light yield calculation.
To estimate the systematic uncertainty in the determination
of the mean value of the SPE distribution, multiple measure-
ments were performed. The discrepancy is within 5%. In the
energy calibration measurements to be mentioned in the next
section, the SPE spectrum with the crystal was used but with a
5% uncertainty attached to be conservative.
4. Energy calibration
The energy calibration was performed using an55Fe source
and an241Am source. The digitizer was triggered when the
height of a pulse from the PMT was more than 50 ADC counts
(∼2 PE). As can be seen in Fig. 3, the height of a single PE pulse
was around 25 ADC counts. The trigger threshold therefore
suppresses most of the electronic noise spikes while letting pass
most of the PE pulses. The trigger rate was ∼2.3 kHz when the
threshold was set to this value.
Each recorded waveform was 10000 ns long as shown in
Fig. 6. About 1000 ns pre-traces were preserved before the
rising edge of a pulse that triggered the digitizer so that there
were enough samples before the pulse to calculate the averaged
pedestal value of the waveform, and 200 samples starting from
zero were used to calculate the baseline. The pedestal was then
adjusted to zero using the method described at section 3.By checking a few waveforms, negative overshoot was com-
monly observed. To further identify whether negative over-
shoot was common, averaged waveforms were examined. As
shown in Fig. 6, averaged pulses were computed by summing
all the waveforms first, then dividing by the number of events.
The tallest one is the averaged 59.5 keV waveform, the sec-
ond tallest one is the averaged 26.3 keV waveform, the second
smallest one is the averaged 17.5 keV waveform, and the small-
est one is the averaged 5.9 keV waveform. In the left figure, the
negative overshoot e ffect from the PMT can be clearly seen.
Figure 6: Averaged waveforms with negative overshoot. The tail part of the
waveform was fit by an exponential function to estimate the negative overshoot
effect.
Figure 7: Averaged waveforms after correction.
4.1. Correction of negative overshoot
Fig. 8 shows the high voltage (HV) distribution circuit and
the readout scheme of our PMT given by its manufacturer,
Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. A 2,000 pF capacitor, C, is used to
decouple the output line from the anode biased at high voltage.
The 51 Ωload resistor, R, is used to match the impedance of
typical oscilloscopes and digitizers. The waveform of Voutcan
be tuned by selecting the values of C,C′,R, and R′as described
4in detail in Ref. [38]. We did not observe any negative over-
shoot in previous measurements when we used the same PMT.
The values of these passive components must have been fine-
tuned by Hamamatsu to reduce the negative overshoot. How-
ever, their values may have changed over time and through mul-
tiple thermal cycles, which resulted in the negative overshoot
shown in Fig. 6.
As the RCcircuit is the origin of the negative overshoot, it
is possible to correct this e ffect offline. A simple numerical
method was developed to achieve this. Its derivation is ex-
plained step by step here. First, the current going through the
load resistor Rcan be expressed as
I=Vout
R=dQ
dt, (1)
where Qis the charge accumulated in C. It can be expressed as
Q=C(Vin−Vout). (2)
Combing the two equations, we have
dQ
dt=C(dVin
dt−dVout
dt)=Vout
R, (3)
which can be rearranged as
Vout=RC dVin
dt−dVout
dt!
(4)
Numerically, this can be written as
Vout[i]=RC Vin[i]−Vin[i−1]
∆t−Vout[i]−Vout[i−1]
∆t!
,(5)
where iis the index of individual samples in the waveform, and
∆t=1 ns is the time interval between two consecutive samples.
The iterative expression of Vincan be derived from Eq. 5:
Vin[i]=RC+ ∆t
RCVout[i]−Vout[i−1]+Vin[i−1].(6)
TheRCconstant in Eq. 6 was measured to be 18 ,044 ns by fit-
ting a simple exponential function to the averaged waveforms
as shown in Fig. 6 in the range of [7 ,000,10,000] ns, where the
influence of scintillation decay can be neglected and the influ-
ence of the RCcircuit persists.
Therefore, V outcan be corrected sample by sample once the
RC constant was identified. The averaged waveforms after cor-
rection shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate the success of this correc-
tion method and the reasonableness of the RC constant. The
same correction method with the same RC constant was then
applied to each waveform. This method produces reasonable
waveforms and doesn’t make any assumptions on the input sig-
nal.
Every waveform after the correction was integrated from
zero to the end. The integration had a unit of ADC counts ·ns.
In Fig. 9, the recorded energy spectra before correction are the
green dashed line histogram, and the energy spectra after cor-
rection are the blue solid line histogram. A dominant 5.9 keV
peak from55Fe can be seen, 17.5 keV , 26.3 keV and 59.5 keVpeaks from241Am are shown as well. Fits were applied to the
corrected spectra. The Gaussian fit was applied to the 5.9 and
59.5 keV peaks. The combined fit was applied to 13.9, 17.5
and 21.0 keV peaks, and then applied to 17.5, 21.0 and 26.3
keV peaks. Pulse area means obtained from those fits are sum-
marized in Table 1, and whether the light response stays consis-
tent in the energy close to the threshold is evaluated in the next
section.
5. Light yield
The pulse area values ( A) of the radiation pulses in the unit
of ADC counts·ns were converted to the number of PE ( NPE)
using the formula:
NPE=A−m0
mean SPE. (7)
The shift value, m0, is added to account for the overall shift
of the pulses observed in the single PE measurement. However,
compared to the pulse area values, the shift is small.
The light yield ( Y) for a given energy deposited ( Edep) in our
electron recoil measurements was then calculated using the fol-
lowing equation:
Y[PE/keV ee]=NPE
Edep. (8)
The calculated light yields in di fferent setups are shown in
Table 1, similar light yields observed from two cryostats con-
firm the cooling capability of the new cryostat.
In the new cryostat, the light yield from the59Fe 5.9 keV
radiation is 33.4±1.7 PE/keV ee, while the light yield from the
241Am 59.5 keV radiation is 40.0 ±2.0 PE/keV ee. The variation
in the light yield at di fferent energies is also seen in the old
cryostat setup, with a light yield of 35.9 ±1.8 PE/keV eefrom
the 5.9 keV radiation and a light yield of 39.2 ±2.0 PE/keV ee
from the 59.5 keV radiation.
The observed nonlinearity of pure CsI crystal at di fferent en-
ergies was also seen in Ref. [5–9, 28–30]. Crystals from dif-
ferent vendors show slightly di fferent behavior. Light yield de-
creases slightly as energy goes down. One possible explanation
is that low-energy radiation cannot penetrate far into the crystal,
the survivability of optical photons created around the surface
of the crystal depends highly on the local surface condition;
while high-energy radiation on average creates optical photons
deep inside the crystal, their survivability does not depend on
the surface condition.
6. Conclusion
This study describes the development of a liquid nitrogen-
based cryostat setup for measuring the nuclear quenching factor
of undoped CsI crystals at cryogenic temperatures. The cryo-
stat was designed to avoid neutron scattering in high- Zmate-
rials and achieved a light yield of 33 .4±1.7 PE/keV eeat 5.9
keV ee. The results of the quenching factor measurement will be
