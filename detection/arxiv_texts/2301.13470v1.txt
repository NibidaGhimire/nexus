ABSTRACT
AR Scorpii (AR Sco), the only-known radio-pulsing white dwa rf binary, shows unusual pulsating emission at the radio, in frared,
optical and ultraviolet bands. To determine its astrometri c parameters at the radio band independently, we conducted m ulti-
epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) phase-refe rencing observations with the European VLBI Network (EVN) a t
5 GHz and the Chinese VLBI Network (CVN) plus the Warkworth 30 -metre telescope (New Zealand) at 8.6 GHz. By using
the diﬀerential VLBI astrometry, we provide high-precision astro metric measurements on the parallax ( π=8.52+0.04
−0.07mas),
and proper motion ( µα=9.48+0.04
−0.07mas yr−1,µδ=−51.32+0.22
−0.38mas yr−1). The new VLBI results agree with the optical Gaia
astrometry. Our kinematic analysis reveals that the Galact ic space velocities of AR Sco are quite consistent with that o f both
intermediate polars (IPs) and polars. Combined with the pre vious tightest VLBI constraint on the size, our parallax dis tance
suggests that the radio emission of AR Sco should be located w ithin the light cylinder of its white dwarf.

1 INTRODUCTION
AR Scorpii (AR Sco) is a white dwarf (WD) /M-type star binary with
an orbital period of ∼3.56 h and a WD spin period of ∼1.95 min
(Marsh et al. 2016 ). Unusual pulsations in short timescales of a pe-
riod of∼1.97 min are detected at multiple bands (ultraviolet, op-
tical, infrared and radio). Its non-synchronous spin and or bital pe-
riods imply a connection with a class of stars known as interm edi-
ate polars (IPs, e.g. Patterson 1994 ), whereas its weak X-ray radi-
ation distinguishes itself from usual IPs ( Takata et al. 2018 ). The
strong radio emission and broadband spectral energy distri bution
of AR Sco are similar to those of a special IP system AE Aquarii
(Bookbinder & Lamb 1987 ;Oruru & Meintjes 2012 ). However, the
radio pulsation properties of AR Sco were unique among WD sys -
tems.
The exact emission mechanism of AR Sco is still unclear and a
large number of models have been proposed to interpret its un ique
observed behaviour. Marsh et al. (2016 ) proposed scenarios where
the pulsed emission came from collimated fast particle outﬂ ows or
the direct interaction of the magnetosphere of the WD with th e M
⋆E-mail: cuilang@xao.ac.cncompanion. Geng et al. (2016 ) suggested that the WD’s rotational
axis was nearly perpendicular to its magnetic axis, and the m agnetic
interaction occurred when the WD’s open ﬁeld line beams swep t
the secondary’s wind. Katz (2017 ) also proposed a misaligned-spin
model and supposed a precessing spin axis to explain the disp lace-
ment of the optical maximum from conjunction of this system, but
suggested that the magnetic interaction occurs within the M D’s at-
mosphere. Garnavich et al. (2019 ) investigated the possible exis-
tence of magnetic loops or prominence of the M star, the magne tic
interaction with these may contribute to the system’s emiss ion. The
energy that comes from AR Sco may be generated through magnet o-
hydrodynamic interactions ( Buckley et al. 2017 ) or fast magnetic re-
connection events ( Garnavich et al. 2019 ), and Bednarek (2018 ) dis-
cussed a hadronic model.
Accurate astrometry on AR Sco will allow us to constrain
its physical properties (e.g. velocity, luminosity, emiss ion region
size). It helps to validate the theoretical models, to trail the evo-
lutionary history, and to explore the possibility of this sy stem
being a future source of detectable gravitational wave emis sion
(Franzon & Schramm 2017 ). For AR Sco, Marsh et al. (2016 ) gave a
rough estimate of the distance of d=116±16 pc, based on the spec-
tra and photometry of the M star in optical and infrared. By co m-

bining with the ﬁrst Gaia Data Release ( Gaia Collaboration et al.
2016 ), the ﬁfth US Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog
(Zacharias et al. 2017 ) obtained a proper motion estimate of µα=
4.0±2.2 mas yr−1,µδ=−50.8±2.0 mas yr−1in optical. Based on
optical astrometric measurements, the Gaia Early Data Release 3
(Gaia EDR3, Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021 ) provided a parallax es-
timate ofπ=8.544±0.038 mas and proper motion estimates of
µα=9.690±0.047 mas yr−1,µδ=−51.489±0.038 mas yr−1for
AR Sco. Our goal was to determine the astrometric parameters of
AR Sco with the technique of Very Long Baseline Interferomet ry
(VLBI) at the radio band. As the only technique that can deriv e
high precision positions of target sources comparable to Gaia , VLBI
could provide new and independent astrometric results to va lidate
theGaia results.
In this paper, we present new astrometric measurements for A R
Sco from the European VLBI Network (EVN) and the Chinese
VLBI Network (CVN) plus Warkworth 30-m radio telescope obse r-
vations over a period of ∼1.5 years. We describe the observations
and data reduction in Section 2. The high precision astrometric re-
sults are presented in Section 3. We compare our VLBI results with
those from Gaia ’s, and analyse the kinematics and physical param-
eters of AR Sco in Section 4. Finally, we summarise the study in
Section 5.
2 OBSERV ATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
2.1 EVN observations and data reduction
Our EVN observations of AR Sco at 5 GHz were conducted in e-
VLBI mode ( Szomoru 2008 ) at ﬁve epochs between 2017 February
and 2018 January. Table 1lists the observing dates, the participat-
ing stations and the time durations. The raw data were at a dat a rate
of 2048 Mbps (dual polarisation, 8 ×32 MHz bandwidth per polarisa-
tion, two-bit quantisation) and correlated in real-time (e -EVN mode)
by the SFXC software correlator ( Keimpema et al. 2015 ) at JIVE
(Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC, the Netherlands).
The observations of AR Sco were performed with the two
phase-referencing calibrators: PKS J1625 −2527 (J1625−2527, e.g.
Fey et al. 1996 ) and PMN J1621−2241 (J1621-2241, Griﬃth et al.
1994 ). The primary calibrator J1625 −2527 located 2.◦7 away from
AR Sco was selected from Astrogeo Centre1. The secondary calibra-
tor J1621−2241 was selected based on our pilot short VLBI obser-
vation (project code: RSC03) at 5 GHz. It is 12 arcmin away fro m
AR Sco, and shows a point-like structure with a peak brightne ss of
∼20 mJy beam−1. The cycle time was about 6 minutes: ∼1 min for
the primary calibrator, ∼4 min for the target, and ∼1 min for the
gap. The secondary calibrator was observed for one ∼2 min scan
per three cycles. This additional faint calibrator allows u s to run a
further iteration of the phase-referencing calibration to signiﬁcantly
improve the astrometric precision (e.g. Doi et al. 2006 ;Paragi et al.
2013 ). Table 2lists the correlation phase centres for these three
sources.
The data reduction was performed with the NRAO Astronomical
Image Processing System ( aips,Greisen 2003 ). The baselines when
one or both antennas were pointing below 10 degree elevation or
the data were severely corrupted by radio frequency interfe rence,
weather, recording or instrumental problems were initiall y ﬂagged.
No correction was made to update the Earth Orientation Param e-
ters or digital sampling bias corrections applied at correl ation time
1http://astrogeo.org/calib/search.htmlby the SFXC correlator. The ionospheric delay was corrected using
Jet Propulsion Laboratory Global Ionospheric Maps with the aips
taskTECOR . We conducted a priori amplitude calibration via stan-
dard gain curves and system temperature measurements of par tici-
pating stations. In case of no available system temperature data, the
priori amplitude calibration was conducted using the nomin al sys-
tem equivalent ﬂux densities with the aipstaskCLCOR . The parallac-
tic angle correction was applied by the task CLCOR . The instrumental
phase errors across intermediate frequencies were removed through
a manual phase calibration with the primary calibrator J162 5−2527.
Global fringe ﬁtting and bandpass calibration were also app lied with
J1625−2527. TheaipstaskCALIB was used to compute both ampli-
tude and phase self-calibration corrections for J1625 −2527, and the
solutions were transferred to the secondary calibrator J16 21−2241
and the target AR Sco. After these calibrations, the phases o f both
J1621−2241 and AR Sco were phase referenced to J1625 −2527.
Imaging and self-calibration for J1621 −2241 data were performed
indifmap (Shepherd et al. 1994 ). The clean maps for J1621 −2241
without self-calibration were then loaded into aips, and the position
and position uncertainties were derived with the task JMFIT . In our
experiments, the secondary calibrator J1621 −2241 was regarded as
a stationary reference source. We set J1621 −2241 at its correlation
phase centre with a point model and used the aips taskCALIB to
derive phase corrections, and the corresponding solutions were ap-
plied to J1621−2241 and AR Sco. This step could improve the ﬁ-
nal image ﬁdelity of AR Sco. And AR Sco was phase referenced to
J1621−2241. Finally, we imaged AR Sco in aips.
2.2 CVN plusWaobservations and data reduction
In order to expand the time span of the observations and impro ve as-
trometric accuracy, we also conducted VLBI observations of AR Sco
at 8.6 GHz with the CVN plus the Warkworth 30-m radio tele-
scope (Wa, Woodburn et al. 2015 ), located in New Zealand, under
the program CC001 at ﬁve epochs between 2017 September and
2018 September. Adding Wato the network allowed us to signiﬁ-
cantly boost the resolution in the north-south direction. T he observ-
ing setup is also summarised in Table 1. The data were recorded in
the disks at a data rate of 2048 Mbps (16 subbands, 32 MHz ﬁlter s,
right-hand circular polarisation, two-bit quantisation) . The correla-
tion was executed with the DiFX software correlator ( Deller et al.
2011 ) at Shanghai Astronomical Observatory.
These CVN plusWaobservations at 8.6 GHz followed the above
EVN observing strategy. The data were also reduced and image d
in a very similar way. Moreover, the EOPs and digital sampler bias
corrections were performed with the aips taskCLCOR andACCOR ,
respectively.
3 RESULTS
3.1 VLBI imaging results
The EVN image of the secondary calibrator J1621 −2241 observed
on 2017 April 12 is shown in Fig. 1. This image was made with nat-
ural weighting and has a noise level of 0.3 mJy beam−1. It shows a
point-like source with a peak ﬂux density of 36.4 mJy beam−1. Fit-
ting a circular Gaussian model to the visibility data gave a ﬂ ux den-
sity of∼41.3 mJy and a size of ∼0.7 mas. For CVN plus WAob-
servations at 8.6 GHz, the calibrator also shows a point-lik e source
with a mean total ﬂux density of ∼40.6 mJy and a mean size of
∼1.2 mas.

Figure 1. The EVN 5 GHz image of the secondary phase-referencing cali-
brator J1621−2241. The image was obtained with natural weighting and self -
calibration. The contours start from 0.3 mJy beam−1and increase by a factor
of two. The synthesised beam is plotted as the white ellipse i n the bottom left
corner and has a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 4 .6×1.5 mas2at
position angle PA=71.◦8.
Fig.2shows theclean maps of the white dwarf pulsar AR Sco at
5 GHz in the top panels and at 8.6 GHz in the bottom panels. All t he
images were produced with natural weighting. AR Sco display s an
unresolved structure at all epochs. Fitting a circular Gaus sian modelto the visibility data from the highest SNR epoch EL058B gave a
size of 1.6±0.1 mas for AR Sco. The related information is listed
in Table 3. The images have relatively higher noise levels than the
estimated thermal noise, especially for (c) and (f) listed i n Table 3,
probably due to a signiﬁcant sensitivity loss of the 32 MHz di gital
ﬁlters of the digital base band converter 2 system (DBBC2), w hich
was also reported in other EVN observations at similar perio d (e.g.
Yang et al. 2020 ). To get more reasonable ﬂux density estimates, we
scaled the amplitudes by a factor of 1.7 and took a large fract ion,
15 per cent, of the ﬂux density as the uncertainty in Table 3. The
factor was derived by comparing our ﬂux densities obtained f rom
CVN observations at 8.6 GHz with that obtained from the Austr alian
Long Baseline Array (LBA) observation at 8.4 GHz ( Marcote et al.
2017 ).
The target AR Sco were successfully detected in six epochs. I n
the other four epochs (EL058A, EL058E, CC001A, CC001D), the re
were no useful astrometric results because of various issue s (antenna
failures, weak/no fringes for the calibrators, low observing eleva-
tions and incorrect coordinate).
3.2 Astrometry
The position of the extra-galactic reference source J1621 −2241 was
obtained from both the EVN observations and the CVN plus Wa
observations, with respect to the primary calibrator J1625 −2527.
We found that the position dispersion in the EVN observation s
(σα=9.8 mas,σδ=8.9 mas) was larger than that in the CVN plus
Waobservations (σα=1.0 mas,σδ=1.8 mas). For the EVN obser-
vations, the relatively high latitude of the array caused th e diﬃculty
of observing such low declination source, the majority of an tennas
were pointing at relatively low elevation ( ∼15◦) during observa-
tions. The large angular distance between the primary calib rator and
the secondary could lead to lobe ambiguities for these low el eva-
tion observations. The limited on-source time ( ∼20 min) for the sec-
ondary calibrator could aggravate this condition. These te rms cause
the large position dispersion for J1621 −2241 in the EVN observa-
tions. For the CVN plus Waobservation, the relative lower latitude
array and longer on-source time ( ∼1 h) for J1621−2241 alleviate
this problem. Moreover, the lobe ambiguities will be elimin ated for
the target when referencing the target to the secondary cali brator, as
the secondary calibrator is only 12 arcmin away from the targ et.

A weighted average method was used to derive the position of
J1621−2241 with the combination of EVN observations and CVN
plusWaobservations. First, the arithmetic mean position was calc u-
lated from each of the two observational arrays separately. Next, we
derived the weighted mean position from the two arithmetic m ean
positions. The weights of the mean positions from two arrays were
set as inversely proportional to the square of their dispers ion. As
the used calibrator J1625 −2527 is an International Celestial Refer-
ence Frame (ICRF) deﬁning source, its position was correcte d by
its ICRF32(Charlot et al. 2020 ) S/X-band coordinate of αJ2000=
2https://hpiers.obspm.fr/icrs-pc/newwww/index.php16h25m46.s8916429±0.03 mas,δJ2000=−25◦27′38.′′326873±
0.03 mas. Finally, we provided the position of J1621 −2241 of
αJ2000=16h21m32.s27524±1.0 mas,δJ2000=−22◦41′01.′′3982±
1.7 mas, with the uncertainty given by the combination of the un cer-
tainty in the weighted mean position of J1621 −2241 and the uncer-
tainty in the ICRF3 position of J1625 −2527.
With respect to J1621 −2241, we measured the astrometric param-
eters at the epoch J2018 for AR Sco. The aipstaskJMFIT was used
to derive the radio centroid of AR Sco at each epoch. The ﬁnal p osi-
tion oﬀsets and the formal position uncertainties are listed in Tab le3.
These formal position uncertainties are the combinations o f the sta-
tistical error extracted in the image by the aipstaskJMFIT and the as-
MNRAS 000,1–12(2023)VLBI astrometry on AR Sco 5
trometric error caused by the phase-referencing technolog y. For the
latter, we derived an estimate of 0.07 mas from Pradel et al. (2006 )
based on the position o ﬀset between the target and the secondary
calibrator. For the astrometric ﬁt, the e ﬀect caused by the potential
core shift in the secondary calibrator was considered. No ob vious
jet structure was detected for the secondary calibrator in o ur ob-
servations. The typical frequency-dependent core shift of 0.11 mas
in each direction between 5 GHz and ∼8.6 GHz ( Sokolovsky et al.
2011 ) was added as a term of systemic error to the position uncer-
tainties which were derived from EVN observations for AR Sco .
A bootstrap approach (e.g. Efron & Tibshirani 1991 ;Deller et al.
2019 ) for astrometric ﬁt was performed on the position o ﬀsets
and their uncertainties for AR Sco. We conducted 10 000 times
random sampling with replacement from the available six dat a
points. A least-squares ﬁt was performed for each sampled da ta
set. At last, a statistical distribution was obtained for ea ch param-
eter. Fig. 3shows the bootstrap astrometric ﬁt and bootstrap his-
tograms for AR Sco. According to the median value and the sta-
tistical 68 per cent conﬁdence interval, we derived a parall ax of
π=8.52+0.04
−0.07mas. The other astrometric parameters were also de-
rived in the same way and the results are listed in Table 4. Note
that we used both the Gaia EDR3 position and our VLBI position
of J1621−2241 to calculate the position of AR Sco, so each result
is with respect to the celestial reference frame of Gaia (Gaia -CRF,
Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022 ) and ICRF3, respectively. The posi-
tion uncertainties of J1621 −2241 were taken into account for esti-
mating the position uncertainties of AR Sco. For the Gaia EDR3
position of J1621−2241, a median radio–optical positional o ﬀset of
0.5 mas from Gaia Collaboration et al. (2022 ) was added to the po-
sition uncertainties.
The reduced chi-squared of the least-squares ﬁt was perform ed
to verify the bootstrap astrometric ﬁt. The illustration of the ﬁ-
nal astrometric ﬁt is shown in Fig. 4. We obtained a parallax esti-
mate ofπ=8.53±0.07 mas and proper motion estimates of µα=
9.47±0.09 mas yr−1,µδ=−51.37±0.19 mas yr−1for AR Sco. All
astrometric parameters derived by the reduced chi-squared method
are well consistent with those extracted from the bootstrap approach.
Therefore, the reduced chi-squared astrometric ﬁt validat es the boot-
strap results. And we report the bootstrap results as our ﬁna l results.
4 DISCUSSION
4.1 Comparison with results of Gaia EDR3
We obtained independent astrometric measurements for AR Sc o at
the radio band in Section 3. In optical, Gaia EDR3 provided astro-
metric results for AR Sco as listed in Table 4. The Gaia position was
calculated to epoch J2018 and a direct comparison with our VL BI
results can be performed. The position parameters for the VL BI re-
sults were derived in both ICRF3 and Gaia -CRF. The diﬀerences
between the VLBI positions and the Gaia ’s are smaller than or close
to 1-σuncertainties in Gaia -CRF. In ICRF3, the di ﬀerence in po-
sition in R.A. is smaller than 1- σuncertainty and the di ﬀerence in
position in decl. is quite close to 2- σuncertainty. We note that the
uncertainties in the position of AR Sco are dominated by thos e of
its reference source J1621 −2241. Future astrometric VLBI observa-
tions for J1621−2241 will give improved estimates in the position
of AR Sco. At present, there is no obvious o ﬀset between the optical
and radio positions of AR Sco.
For the Gaia parallax, a zero-point correction of −0.043 mas from
Lindegren et al. (2021 ) and an inﬂated error bar of 0.040 mas fromEl-Badry et al. (2021 ) has been applied to the raw Gaia parallax
π=8.544±0.038 mas. We found that the VLBI parallax was con-
sistent with the raw Gaia parallax within 1-σ. But the diﬀerence
between the VLBI parallax and the zero-point corrected Gaia par-
allax slightly exceeds 1- σ. The global parallax bias for Gaia EDR3
measured from a large number of quasars is 17 µas (Lindegren et al.
2021 ). Compared with the global parallax bias, the value of the
zero-point correction of −0.043 mas for AR Sco is relatively large.
AR Sco is situated at small Galactic latitude ( ∼19◦) could explain
it, in which a small number of quasars identiﬁed and a possibl e con-
tamination of the quasars sample caused by Galactic stars le ads to
the diﬃculty of estimates of zero-point corrections. In addition, the
zero-point estimates are well populated by the quasars at ma gnitude
G≥16. Beyond that region, the uncertainties of the zero-point cor-
rections will be greater ( Lindegren et al. 2021 ). The apparent mag-
nitude of AR Sco in the Gaia G band is 14.99, beyond that region.
VLBI astrometric observations of radio stars can validate t he quality
ofGaia -CRF and help to determine the parallax zero-point of Gaia
catalogue (e.g. Bobylev 2019 ;Xu et al. 2019 ;Lindegren 2020 ). Our
high-precision VLBI results for AR Sco can be used as indepen dent
measurements for the aims.
In a word, the VLBI results are consistent with the Gaia re-
sult with no obvious o ﬀset. Here we derived astrometric parame-
ters for AR Sco with the combination of VLBI and Gaia result. The
weighted average method was used to derive new astrometric p aram-
eter. The weights of astrometric parameters were set to be in versely
proportional to the square of their uncertainties during th e calcula-
tion. We obtain the parallax ( π=8.57±0.03 mas), and proper mo-
tion (µα=9.62±0.04 mas yr−1,µδ=−51.49±0.04 mas yr−1), for
AR Sco.
4.2 Kinematics
We computed the Galactic space velocities U,VandWfor AR Sco
in a right-handed system following Johnson & Soderblom (1987 )
where U,VandWwere measured positive in the directions of the
Galactic centre, the Galactic rotation, and the North Galac tic Pole,
respectively. An assumption of zero radial velocity for the target
AR Sco was adopted to calculate the Galactic space velocitie s (e.g.
Sion et al. 2014 ). A motion of the Sun of ( U/circledottext,V/circledottext,W/circledottext)=(10.1,
13.6, 7.0) km s−1(Bobylev et al. 2021 ) relative to the local standard
of rest was adopted for the solar motion correction. By using the
astrometric results obtained in 4.1, we derived Galactic space veloc-
ities of ( U,V,W)=(15.4,−4.8,−14.7) km s−1, corresponding to a
total velocity of T=21.8 km s−1, for AR Sco.
For AR Sco, its non-synchronous spin and orbital periods im-
ply a connection with IPs. Takata et al. (2018 ) categorised AR Sco
as an unusual IP directly. However, the lack of Doppler-broa dened
line emission is indicative of the absence of accretion disk s, and
the weak X-ray radiation implies that the majority of its lum inos-
ity is not attributable to accretion. In contrast, accretio n is the main
power source for most IPs (e.g. Buckley 2000 ). A more reliable
hypothesis is that AR Sco represents an evolutionary stage o f IPs
(Marsh et al. 2016 ). In this sense, AR Sco could be a progenitor
star of IPs ( Meintjes 2017 ) or a transitional star lying between IPs
and traditional polars ( Katz 2017 ). Moreover, Schreiber et al. (2021 )
presented evolutionary models for the magnetic WDs in close binary
stars and suggested that AR Sco is a progenitor star of polars . AR
Sco represents a short spin down phase for strongly magnetic WDs
in binaries in their evolutionary sequence. The stage occur s at the be-
ginning of synchronization of the spin and orbital period fo r strongly
magnetic WD binaries and ﬁnally polars will be formed.

aA zero-point correction has been applied to the Gaia parallax.
Here we investigate the kinematics of AR Sco relative to a sam ple
of 82 IPs and 107 polars. The kinematics and statistics of IPs and
polars can be seen in appendix A. Statistics show that IPs have sig-
niﬁcantly lower velocity dispersion than IP candidates. Po lars have
slightly lower velocity dispersion than polar candidates. The kine-
matic properties of IPs and polars are highly similar to each other,
as both IPs and polars are sub-type stars of magnetic catacly smic
variables. In Fig. 5, we plotted U−Vspace velocity diagram for the
sample and AR Sco. Being an unique source, AR Sco, however, is
not an outlier with respect to both IPs and polars as shown in F ig.5.
Its Galactic space velocities are quite consistent with tha t of both
IPs and polars. This is reasonable under the assumptions tha t AR
Sco now goes through a short-lived spin-down evolutionary s tage of
IPs or polars.4.3 Radio emitting region
The parallax derived from the combinations of VLBI and Gaia re-
sults sets AR Sco at a distance of 116 .7±0.4 pc. With a source size
of 0.17 mas of AR Sco obtained with the LBA at 8.4 GHz reported
byMarcote et al. (2017 ), the distance establishes that the radio emit-
ting region size is/lessorsimilar3×1011cm. The size is only about half the light
cylinder radius ( RLC∼6×1011cm) of the WD. This implies that
the main radio emission region is situated inside the light c ylinder of
the WD. The ﬁnding is in agreement with what Singh et al. (2020 )
derived fromγ-ray data and favours the models in which the main
radio emission comes from a region near the WD, or the M star as
this companion is situated well inside the magnetosphere of the WD
(e.g. Geng et al. 2016 ;Katz 2017 ).

4.4 Orbital reﬂex motion
For AR Sco, the mass of the WD and M star were derived as
MWD≈0.8M/circledottext,MM≈0.3M/circledottext, respectively ( Marsh et al. 2016 ).
With the measured orbital period P=0.14853528(8) d and circu-
lar orbit, the orbital radius of the WD is RWD∼2×1010cm, and
the orbital radius of the secondary star is RM∼6×1010cm. Based
on the distance of AR Sco, an amplitude of possible reﬂex moti on
of∼40µas could be expected under the assumption that the non-
thermal emission originates from the MD’s atmosphere (e.g. Katz
2017 ). For those scenarios in which the radio emission region clo se
to the MD surface (e.g. du Plessis et al. 2022 ), a smaller amplitude
of∼10µas may occur. In any case, the amplitude is below the mea-
surement accuracy for our observations. The e ﬀect caused by the
orbital motion is negligible based on the positions of AR Sco were
derived with integral time close to or longer than the orbita l period
in our measurements. Additionally, the calculations imply that the
possible detection of the orbital reﬂex motion for the non-t hermal
emission could help to constrain the emitting region locati on forAR Sco. The microarcsecond VLBI astrometry with high sensit ivity
will make an eﬀort in the future. For instance, the ∼10µas goal of
astrometry using VLBI with the Square Kilometer Array was su g-
gested to be feasible by using the MultiView technique ( Rioja et al.
2017 ).
4.5 Revisiting other physical parameters
Based on the M star’s spectra and brightness, Marsh et al. (2016 )
derived a distance estimate d≈116[MM/(0.3M/circledottext)]1/3pc for AR
Sco, assuming that the M star was close to its Roche lobe and it s
mass MM≈0.3M/circledottext. Adopting the distance of 116 pc to the spectral
energy distribution of this system, they obtained a maximum lumi-
nosity of Lmax≈6.3×1025W. They also measured the orbital period
P=0.14853528(8) d and the radial velocity amplitude of the M star
K=295±4 km s−1, and deﬁned the mass function
M3
WDsin3i
(MWD+MM)2=PK3
2πG=(0.395±0.016)M/circledottext, (1)
where iis the orbital inclination.
Our measurements obtained a more accurate distance for AR Sc o.
A mass of MM≈0.31M/circledottextfor the M star was derived from the
distance-mass relation d≈116[MM/(0.3M/circledottext)]1/3with our distance.
Following the assumption suggested by du Plessis et al. (2019 ) that
the orbital inclination iis approximately equal to the observer angle
ζ=60◦
·4+5◦·3
−6◦·0, we solve the mass function ( 1) with MM≈0.31M/circledottext,
and derived MWD≈1.0+0.2
−0.1M/circledottextfor the WD. However, the observer
angle provided by du Plessis et al. (2019 ) was derived from polar-
ization position angle data which were averaged over a large range
of orbital phase. An updated work performed by du Plessis et al.
(2022 ) shows a variation of ∼30◦inζover the orbital period, the
ζis approximately in range from 55◦to 85◦. Based on these results,
we provide a more conservative estimate of MWD≈1.0±0.2M/circledottext
for the WD. Our distance also resets the maximum luminosity o f
Lmax≈6.4×1025W for AR Sco.
Our parallax supports the distance estimated by Marsh et al.
(2016 ), and the recalculation shows that no substantial correcti on
is needed to these physical parameters of AR Sco.
5 SUMMARY
With the EVN observations at 5 GHz and the CVN plus Waobser-
vations at 8.6 GHz, we clearly detected the compact radio emi ssion
of the only-known white dwarf pulsar AR Sco in the epochs be-
tween 2017 February and 2018 September. Using a nearby calib ra-
tor, 12 arcmin apart from AR Sco, we provide high-precision m ea-
surements on the parallax ( π=8.52+0.04
−0.07mas), and proper motion
(µα=9.48+0.04
−0.07mas yr−1,µδ=−51.32+0.22
−0.38mas yr−1), for AR Sco.
The independent measurements are consistent with the Gaia EDR3
reports. Kinematic analysis shows that the Galactic space v elocities
of AR Sco are quite consistent with that of intermediate pola rs and
polars. Together with the early tightest VLBI constraint on the size,
our parallax distance suggests that the radio emission of AR Sco
would be located within the light cylinder of its white dwarf . Fur-
thermore, we revisit the mass and luminosity of AR Sco with th e
parallax distance and conﬁrm the previous estimates report ed by
Marsh et al. (2016 ).

APPENDIX A: KINEMATICS AND STATISTICS OF IPS
AND POLARS
Table A1presents a sample of IPs and polars with Galactic space
motion results. We assembled this sample by starting with a t raversal
search on the Catalogue of Cataclysmic Binaries, Low-Mass X-Ray
Binaries and Related Objects (Edition 7.24, Ritter & Kolb 2003 ).
We obtained a sample of 280 stars for IPs and polars and found t hat
189 stars already had Gaia EDR3 results (the position, the parallax
and the proper motion) be identiﬁed in the SIMBAD astronomic al
database ( Wenger et al. 2000 ). The sample of 189 stars consists of
82 IPs and 107 polars. The Galactic space velocity calculati ons for
this sample followed the same method described in Subsectio n4.2.
The resultant space motion parameters are listed in Table A1and the
corresponding statistical information is listed in Table A2.
