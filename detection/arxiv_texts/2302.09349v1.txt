Elemental fragmentation cross sections (EFCSs) of stable and unstable nuclides have been inves-
tigated with various projectile-target combinations at a wide range of incident energies. These data
are critical to constrain and develop the theoretical reaction models and to study the propagation of
galactic cosmic rays (GCR). In this work, we present a new EFCS measurement for28Si on carbon at
218 MeV/nucleon performed at the Heavy Ion Research Facility (HIRFL-CSR) complex in Lanzhou.
The impact of the target thickness has been well corrected to derive an accurate EFCS. Our present
results with charge changes  Z= 1-6 are compared to the previous measurements and to the pre-
dictions from the models modied EPAX2, EPAX3, FRACS, ABRABLA07, NUCFRG2, and IQMD
coupled with GEMINI (IQMD+GEMINI). All the models fail to describe the odd-even staggering
strength in the elemental distribution, with the exception of the IQMD+GEMINI model, which
can reproduce the EFCSs with an accuracy of better than 3.5% for  Z5. The IQMD+GEMINI
analysis shows that the odd-even staggering in EFCSs occurs in the sequential statistical decay stage
rather than in the initial dynamical collision stage. This oers a reasonable approach to understand
the underlying mechanism of fragmentation reactions.
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the experimental focuses in current nuclear
physics is to determine the fragmentation cross sections
of nuclei with dierent isospins and masses [1]. The nu-
clei of interest can be produced via projectile fragmenta-
tion. In the past several decades, systematic investiga-
tions in experiments have provided a valuable fragmenta-
tion cross section database. This is crucial to understand
the interaction of energetic heavy nuclei. Moreover, the
cross section data involving stable nuclei are essential to
understanding the shielding and the radiation protection
of energetic heavy ions.
Silicon is one of the \primary" cosmic rays, and known
to be the eighth most common element in the universe
by mass. It is most widely distributed in cosmic dust,
planetoids, and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide
(silica) or silicates. The relevant fragmentation or spal-
lation cross section data on hydrogen, helium, or carbon
at relativistic energies are important inputs to investigate
the propagation of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) (see, e.g.,
Ref. [2]). Moreover, silicon is the main integrated-circuit
element of onboard spacecraft electronics. Its interac-
tions with high-energy charged particles in the cosmic

grated circuits.
Over the last two decades, experimental studies on the
fragmentation of28Si have been performed at various
energies by using dierent detection techniques in lab-
oratories worldwide [3{9]. This isotope oers an ideal
benchmark dataset to check the consistency of experi-
ments, to evaluate the model reliability, and further to
investigate the nuclear structure underneath the heavy-
ion collisions. Nevertheless, we are aware that although
experimental data for28Si are relatively rich, dierent
energy-dependent behaviors were reported. Moreover,
the elemental fragmentation cross sections (EFCSs) per-
formed at similar incident energies for the same reac-
tion system [3, 5, 7] present a large discrepancy by
up to about 40%, albeit with similar heavy-ion detec-
tor systems. In addition, the cross sections at 700-800
MeV/nucleon [8, 9], which were extracted by using CR-
39 detectors, have relatively large uncertainties and are
systematically larger than those measured by the active
heavy-ion detectors. Such divergence in experimental
data could be due to the systematic uncertainties in the
relevant experiments. This hampers our understanding
of the underlying reaction mechanism in fragmentation
reactions, e.g., the formation of odd-even staggering in
charge distribution [10{12].
Several models are now available to predict the heavy-
ion reaction cross sections at intermediate energies. Em-arXiv:2302.09349v1  [nucl-ex]  18 Feb 20232
pirical parametrizations, such as EPAX3 [13], modied
EPAX2 [14], and FRACS [15] models, are developed re-
lying on optimizing the parameters to the existing exper-
imental data. In the EPAX3 empirical formula, cross sec-
tions are considered to be independent of incident projec-
tile energies, while the modied EPAX2 model includes
the target isospin and incident projectile energy depen-
dence for the cross sections at intermediate energies of
20-200 MeV/nucleon. In the FRACS model, the target
dependence, incident projectile energy as well as odd-
even staggering of cross sections are taken into account.
In addition to the empirical formulas, statistical mod-
els (such as ABRABLA07 and NUCFRG2) have been de-
veloped. In this framework, highly excited prefragments
are formed rst, and decay subsequently by emitting light
particles (p,d,t,, etc.), until the resulting products
are unable to undergo further decay. The NUCFRG2
model [16] is a semiempirical cross section model based
on the abrasion-ablation formulation [17].
The isospin-independent quantum molecular dynamics
model (IQMD) [18] coupled with the GEMINI model [19]
(hereafter referred to as IQMD+GEMINI) is a hybrid
model, in which the IQMD model and GEMINI model are
applied separately to describe the primary violent state
of heavy-ion collisions to form the hot prefragments, and
the subsequent statistical deexcitation of prefragments.
Since 2015, we have performed a new experimental
campaign in the energy range of 200-500 MeV/nucleon,
aiming to determine the EFCSs of more than ten sta-
ble isotopes. Here we report the rst result of28Si on
carbon at 218 MeV/nucleon. The experiment overview
is described in Sec. II, and the data analysis procedure
is detailed in Sec. III. Then we analyze the experimen-
tal data by comparing with previous measurements and
model predictions, and discuss the odd-even staggering
in fragment cross section in Sec. IV. Finally, a summary
is given in Sec. V.
II. EXPERIMENT
The experiment was carried out at the Heavy Ion Re-
search Facility (HIRFL-CSR) in Lanzhou [20, 21].40Ar
primary beam was accelerated to 320 MeV/nucleon in
the heavy-ion synchrotron CSRm, extracted in the slow
extraction mode, and impinged into a 10 mm thick beryl-
lium production target. The target was placed at the
entrance of the Second Radioactive Ion Beam Line in
Lanzhou (RIBLL2) [22]. The secondary28Si beam pro-
duced via projectile fragmentation was then separated in
ight by setting the rst half of RIBLL2 to a magnetic
rigidity ( B) of 5.03 Tm, and transported to the Ex-
ternal Target Facility (ETF). There, the28Si beam was
directed into a natural carbon target with the thickness
of 1.86 g/cm2.
A schematic layout of the experimental detector setup
is illustrated in Fig. 1. The time of ight (TOF) of28Si
beam from the rst dispersive focal plane (F1) of RI-BLL2 to ETF was determined event by event by a pair
of fast timing plastic scintillators placed at F1 and ETF,
respectively. The corresponding ight length is approxi-
mately 26 m. The intrinsic TOF resolution achieved from
detectors is as low as 80 ps ( ) [22{25].
A pair of multiple sampling ionization chambers [26,
27] (denoted as MUSIC1 and MUSIC2 in Fig. 1) was
installed at both sides of the carbon reaction target (de-
ned as TA in Fig. 1) to measure the energy deposition
of the incident and outgoing particles, respectively. The
respective active areas are 85 mm 85 mm and 130 mm
130 mm. The large acceptance of MUSIC2 guarantees
the full coverage of outgoing particles. The total length
of 630 mm of MUSIC2 is divided into 24 cells by 13 an-
odes and 12 cathodes. In total, six signals were readout
by connecting the neighboring four cells in series to one
charge-sensitive preamplier. Two types of preampliers
have been used for the rst ve subchambers and the
last one in this experiment, respectively. A Zresolution
of 0.25-0.35 (FWHM) was achieved for fragments of40Ar
using the rst ve subchambers [24].
Two 100 mm100 mm plastic scintillators, each with
a 30 mm30 mm hole (denoted as Veto1 and Veto2
in Fig. 1) at the center, were positioned upstream of the
carbon reaction target to limit the momentum disper-
sion of incoming beams, and to reduce the total trigger
rate. Three multiwire proportional chambers (denoted
as MWPCs in Fig. 1) with an eective area of 85 mm
85 mm, two upstream and one downstream of the re-
action target, were mounted to monitor the trajectories
of incoming and outgoing particles. Combining the in-
formation can help to select the \best" incident beams
within a certain angle and position acceptance. In the
data analysis hereafter, we have restricted the beam size
to 25 mm25 mm on the target.
Measurements without the reaction target were carried
out to eliminate the eect of reactions in the materials
other than the target (e.g., detectors). For the case of an
innitely thin target, the attenuation eect of incident
beam and the secondary reactions in the target can be
safely neglected. This then results in the commonly used
cross section formula, i.e., the EFCS from incident beam

target nuclei per unit area. In this work, the target thick-
ness is about one-ninth of mean free path ( 90 mm) of
28Si on carbon target. The attenuation eect of incident
28Si and the secondary reactions in this case could have
a considerable impact. To account for these eects, we
have deduced the formula of EFCS as detailed in the Ap-
pendix. The EFCS and its uncertainty can be evaluated
by considering the two extreme cases: one neglecting the
contributions to the desired fragments from secondary re-3
actions, and the other neglecting the contributions from
the cascade fragmentation processes. The solution of the
two cases corresponds to Eqs. (A4) and (A12). The nal
centroid values of EFCS are determined by Eq. (A4) for
charge changes  Z= 1-2, by averaging the cross sec-
tions from Eqs. (A4) and (A12) for  Z= 3-4, and by
Eq. (A12) for  Z= 5-6, respectively. The statistical er-
rors for Z= 1-4 and 6 are 4.9-6.5%, and 8.4% for  Z
= 5, respectively. The systematic errors are estimated to
be 2.7-6.0% by considering the peak decoupling methods,
the beam attenuation and secondary reactions in the tar-
get for Z= 1-6. The nal uncertainties are detailed in
the Appendix.

III. DATA ANALYSIS
The particle identication with respect to atomic num-
berZand mass-to-charge ratio A/Zis presented in
Fig. 2, by means of the energy deposition of incident par-
ticles (E) and TOF measurements. In the gure one
can see that various cocktail beams can be clearly iden-
tied. The28Si events are selected with a high purity by
setting a rectangular gate as indicated in Fig. 2, which
corresponds to3.4inZprojection. The28Si events
are counted as N0. The contamination level from the
overlap of neighboring Z= 13 and Z= 15 beam events
relative to Z= 14 is evaluated to be less than 10 4.
The incident energy of28Si in the middle of the car-
bon target is determined to be 218 MeV/nucleon. The
eectiveZdistribution ( Ze) of fragments of28Si versus
the energy deposition in the last subchamber of MUSIC2
[denoted as  E(MU2 6)], is shown in Fig. 3. The Ze
value is calibrated from the energy deposition in the rst
ve subchambers of MUSIC2 from16O to32S withA=Z
= 2 produced by the40Ar primary beam. The calibra-
tion used is  E=C1ZC2

are determined separately by the best t. Each cluster

in region 1 represents a particular fragment species. The
events at charge Z= 14 are dominant and can be easily
identied. The peak positions for particles with Z= 9 to
13 are less distinct but can be fairly well distinguished,
whereas it is dicult to identify and separate the iso-
topes with Z8. Furthermore, the events in region 2
are identied as Z= 14 using the last subchamber of
MUSIC2, but their energy depositions are not fully reg-
istered in the rst ve subchambers. This accounts for
approximately 0.5% of incident28Si. Events in region 3,
the counterpart of region 2, can be identied by using
the rst ve subchambers, and are about 0.1% of28Si.
The events with Ze<2 are due to the eect induced
by the detection eciency of the rst ve subchambers.
This accounts for approximately 0.4% of incident28Si.
The events in region 1 are selected hereafter for the cross
section determination since regions 2 and 3 would not
aect the counting of lower Zevents.
The one-dimensional Zedistribution of28Si fragments
is presented in Fig. 4. One can see that the peak positions
atZ= 6 and 7 are shifted to the positions higher than
their nominal values. The peak width shows a generally
increasing trend with decreasing Z, but with a kink at Z
= 6 and 7, and is relatively large at Z= 6, 8, and 10.4

text for details.
Besides, the peaks of fragments with Z5 are mixed
with each other, thus cannot be resolved. We performed
a cross-check on the resolution of MUSIC2 for Z8,
and concluded that MUSIC2 is able to resolve the frag-
ments with Z5. This was done by selecting16O as
the incident beam instead. Thus, the unresolved peaks
in Fig. 4 are not due to the charge Zresolution.
In our experiment, we employed MUSIC2 with a large
geometric acceptance. This size is essential to cover all
nonreacted incident elements [25, 28] that have a similar
velocity as the incident28Si, and guarantee a good charge
Zresolution. As noted in Refs. [3, 5, 29], the multiplicity
of light fragments will increase with decreasing atomic
number of the produced leading fragment. When the
atomic number Zof produced fragments is much smaller
than that of the incident particle, the large acceptance
detector will also cover the majority of the lighter parti-
cles in addition to the leading fragments. This results in
the shift of charge peak positions to higher values than
expected for isotopes with Z= 6 and 7, and less distinct
peaks and largely overlapping beam events for isotopes
withZ5. Another consequence of the large acceptance
detector is the broadening in peak widths, in particu-lar when the particles can be produced simultaneously
with the leading fragments ( e.g., withN=Z). The pro-
tons from fragmentation do not play a signicant role in
shaping the nal peak width due to their relatively small
energy deposition in MUSIC2.
TheZedistribution from Z= 6 to 14 can be de-
coupled with a multiple-Gaussian function in which the
peak position and width for each Zecan be conned well
from experimental data. Furthermore, we nd that the
Ze= 2-5.5 distribution can be nicely reproduced with
a Gaussian function. Hence the total beam events corre-
sponding to Z= 2-5 andZ= 6-14 have been decoupled
using the individual Gaussian components. The residual
distribution, which is dened as the dierence between
experimental data and the global t, scatters randomly
around zero as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The overall
reduced chi-square value is determined to be 0.60 from
Ze= 2 to 13.5.

= 2-14. The individual Gaussian component for a particu-
lar peak is shown by the dotted line in dierent colors. The
residual distribution from the global t is shown in the inset.
In this study, we focus on EFCSs with Z= 8-13. To5
determine cross sections for Z7 is beyond our scope.
Considering the low statistics, the cross section may suf-
fer from the peak decoupling methods, depending on the
multiple-Gaussian peak widths and central values. As a
test, we have retted the data in the same approach but
with xed peak widths of  Z= 3-6 to those extrapolated
linearly from  Z= 0-2. It is found that the cross sec-
tions agree well with those obtained without xed widths
within the statistical uncertainties, and the centroid val-
ues increase by 6.5 and 5.6 mb for  Z= 3 and 5, and
decrease by 11.0 and 9.6 mb for  Z= 4 and 6 relative to
those determined without xed peak widths, respectively.
As a result, we have treated the potential uncertainty in
tting approach, beam attenuation, and secondary reac-
tions in the target as a systematic uncertainty. The nal
cross sections for  Z= 1-6 and the relevant uncertainties
are given in Table I.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. Elemental fragmentation cross section
Table I summarizes the EFCSs obtained in this work
along with previous measurements for reactions of28Si +
12C at incident energies from 200 to 800 MeV/nucleon.
The rst and second parentheses in our present data are
the statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively.
The experimental data can be classied into two groups
by using either active detectors (like silicon or ioniza-
tion chambers) [3, 5, 7] or CR-39 detectors [4, 8, 9].
Our present measurements for charge changes  Z=
1-6 at 218 MeV/nucleon are generally consistent with
those at 266 and 268 MeV/nucleon within uncertain-
ties. Meanwhile, the total charge-changing cross sec-
tion,CC, is extracted to be 1126(21) mb. The charge-
changing cross sections appear generally constant above
200 MeV/nucleon [31].
Figure 5 presents the EFCSs with  Z= 1-6 of28Si
fragments as a function of incident energies ranging from
200 to 800 MeV/nucleon [3{5, 7]. We estimate hereafter
the total uncertainty of cross section as the square root of
the sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties. The
data from CR-39 experiments [8, 9] are not included here
due to their relatively large uncertainties. In a global
view, the data do not give a consistent energy depen-
dence for  Z= 1 and 2. In particular, the data re-
ported by Webber etal: [3] and Zeitlin etal: [5] show an
opposite trend with increasing energies. They also have
a large dierence in magnitude. The data at 503 and
770 MeV/nucleon are systematically larger than those at
560 and 765 MeV/nucleon. As an example, the discrep-
ancy at 770 MeV/nucleon can be up to about 40% for
Z= 1. On the other hand, the data for  Z= 3-6 tend
to decrease with increasing incident energy, although the
absolute values dier. Both data obtained at 560 and
765 MeV/nucleon are systematically larger than those at
503 and 770 MeV/nucleon, which is the opposite of thecase for Z= 1-2.
The IQMD and IQMD+GEMINI calculations for 100
to 900 MeV/nucleon with a step of 40 MeV/nucleon are
preformed in Fig. 5, respectively. The IQMD calcula-
tion only describes the rst step, i.e., the formation of
the excited prefragments. Then, in the GEMINI model,
highly excited residues will decay to the nal fragments
with lower Zby emitting light particles (mainly includ-
ingp,n,d,). In general, the IQMD model predicts
monotonically changing cross sections for  Z= 1-6. The
statistical deexcitation process in the GEMINI model ac-
counts for 35-45% reduction in cross sections for  Z=
1 and about 10% for  Z= 2 above 200 MeV/nucleon,
and changes the energy dependence for  Z= 4-6. The
IQMD+GEMINI results show a local minimum at about
300 MeV/nucleon for  Z= 1, which is correlated to the
energy dependence of nucleon-nucleon cross section. For
Z= 2-6, the IQMD+GEMINI results decrease rapidly
from 200 to 300 MeV/nucleon, and then appear almost
constant above 300 MeV/nucleon.
B. Comparisons with model predictions
Figure 6 presents the EFCSs of28Si at 218, 266, and
268 MeV/nucleon along with model predictions. The
EFCSs are getting overall smaller when the produced
fragment is getting far away from the projectile. One
can see a clear odd-even staggering, i.e., an enhancement
with even- Zisotope compared to that of the neighboring
odd-Zisotope. Both the modied EPAX2 and EPAX3
models predict a monotonically decreasing trend with in-
creasing Z. The FRACS results can generally follow
the experimental trend for  Z= 1 to 6, but underesti-
mate cross sections for  Z= 7 and 8. For the abrasion-
ablation models, the ABRABLA07 results can reproduce
the experimental results fairly well. The NUCFRG2 re-
sults show a monotonically decreasing trend with the in-
crement of  Zfrom 2 to 8. Although both FRACS and
ABRABLA07 models include the odd-even staggering,
they predict decidedly dierent magnitudes of this stag-
gering than what is exhibited by the data.
The IQMD+GEMINI calculation can reproduce the
experimental data with an accuracy of better than 3.5%
except for  Z= 6 and 8. It is worthwhile to note that the
same model can also nicely reproduce cross sections mea-
sured in Refs. [32{34]. This demonstrates that the com-
bination of primary dynamical collisions and sequential
statistical deexcitation procedures can provide a reason-
able description for heavy-ion collisions over a large range
of incident energies. For  Z= 6 and 8, a close compar-
ison indicates that the IQMD+GEMINI calculation un-
derestimates experimental data. This underestimation,
however, was not observed for data of 400 MeV/nucleon
36;40Al and 650 MeV/nucleon35Cl on Al target [32, 33].

the IQMD model are compared to those of the nal frag-
ments by the IQMD+GEMINI model in Fig. 6. Dier-6

ently from the IQMD+GEMINI results, the IQMD model
predicts a monotonically decreasing cross sections with
increasing  Zfrom 1 to 8; this leads to a constant odd-
even staggering strength. The high excitation energy of
the primary fragments allows several times of sequential
decay and hence huge decay paths. The decay path end-
ing as a nal fragment with higher stability will be chosen
with a higher probability.
C. Odd-even staggering
The odd-even staggering has been discussed in the iso-
topic cross section from projectile fragmentation (see,
e.g, in Refs. [35{37]). To characterize the strength of
odd-even staggering in charge distribution, the quantity
V(Z) is dened [32]:
V(Z) =2(Z)
(Z+ 1) +(Z 1); (2)where the(Z) refers to the EFCS with a particular
knockout proton number  Z. Figure 7 presents V(Z)
as a function of  Zfor28Si fragments. Filled sym-
bols are the data determined in the present work with
28Si at 218 MeV/nucleon, while open circles and open
squares are those measured at 266 MeV/nucleon [5] and
268 MeV/nucleon [7], respectively. The V(Z) values
are larger than 1 for even- Zand less than 1 for odd- Znu-
clei, and are close to 1 when odd-even staggering strength
is weak. In contrast, the IQMD+GEMINI results repro-
duce the experimental V(Z) from Z= 2 to 7, both in
the strength and oscillation, while the ABRABLA07 and
FRACS models predict a weaker staggering strength than
experimental data. It should be noted that the odd-even
staggering strength V(Z) will become weaker when us-
ing the cross sections determined with xed widths in the
tting approach. The centroid values decrease by about
0.04 and 0.25 for  Z= 2 and 4, and increase by about
0.08 and 0.11 for  Z= 3 and 5, respectively.

Both the abrasion-ablation and IQMD+GEMINI are
two-step models. Nevertheless, the calculated odd-even
staggerings by those models are dierent, as shown in9
Fig. 7. To clarify the reasons, it is worthwhile to note
that the treatments of the rst step in the abrasion and
IQMD models are distinctly dierent. In the abrasion
model, the number of abraded nucleons is proportional
to the volume of the overlap region, and the average exci-
tation energy of the primary fragments after abrasion is
estimated from the additional surface energy [17]. This is
a macroscopic treatment, but the treatment in the IQMD
model is microscopic. The calculations of the excitation
energy of primary fragments depend on the dissipation
of the incident energy and the energy-density functional,
where not only the surface energy but also other interac-
tions are considered. The excitation energies of primary
fragments by the IQMD model are larger than those by
the abrasion model (see Fig. 2 in Ref. [17] and Fig. 5 in
Ref. [10]). The underestimation of the odd-even stagger-
ing by the abrasion-ablation models (ABRABLA07 and
NUCFRG2) are attributed to the low excitation energy of
primary fragments. Accordingly, in the decay of the pri-
mary fragments with low excitation energy, the diversity
of the decay path is restrained and then the population
of the nal fragment depends more on the initial state
rather than the stability of the nal state.
The odd-even staggering is attributed to the existence
of pairing correlations in nuclear binding energy [35]. In
the IQMD+GEMINI model which reproduces reasonably
the odd-even staggering, nuclear masses and level den-
sity with pairing correlations are adopted in the GEM-
INI model. On the other hand, pairing correlations are
not taken into account in the IQMD model that treats
the rst step. Experimental data in the reactions for the
isotopic chains will be valuable to study the eect of the
pairing correlation in the peripheral collisions.
V. SUMMARY
In summary, we reported new results on EFCSs of28Si
on carbon at 218 MeV/nucleon. The data show an odd-
even staggering with  Z= 1-6 and a local minimum at
Z= 5. Our experimental results are generally consis-
tent with the previous measurements at similar energies.
We analyzed the dependence on the incident energy of
fragment cross sections with  Z= 1-6. By excluding
the CR-39 results [8, 9], the existing data show in gen-
eral a decreasing cross section for  Z= 3-6, but there is
no decisive conclusion for  Z= 1 and 2.
In addition, the IQMD+GEMINI calculation of the
EFCSs at dierent energies was performed. Deviations
in both the magnitude and energy-dependent trend are
seen when compared with the experimental data. This
is partially due to the divergence in existing data. High-
quality data over dierent energy regions are thus called
for to constrain this framework.
Among the various predictions performed, it is found
that the modied EPAX2, EPAX3, and NUCFRG2 mod-
els cannot describe the EFCSs, while the ABRABLA07
and FRACS models predict a weaker odd-even staggeringstrength. The IQMD+GEMINI model can reproduce the
experimental data with an accuracy of better than 3.5%
for Z5, both in the trend and the odd-even stag-
gering. We then analyzed the formation mechanism of
odd-even staggering in charge distribution by comparing
the IQMD results with the IQMD+GEMINI. The de-
cay process from hot primary fragments in the GEMINI
model shapes the nal odd-even staggering.

increase of fragment species with Zproduced from the
incident beam bombarding the target, i.e., one-step reac-
tion. The second and the third terms represent the yield
from intermediate fragments jdue to multistep reactions
and the loss of the fragment species, respectively. Both
are attributed to the secondary reactions in the target.
Note that in Eq. (A1) the charge-exchange reaction is not
considered since it is of typically less than mb.

When the target thickness is comparable with the mean
free path of the incident ions, the attenuation eect of
incident beam and the secondary reactions in the target10
should be taken into account for a better accuracy. In the
following calculations, we describe our approach on how
to deduce the EFCS and its uncertainty. This approach
is general and can give a more precise centroid value of
the cross section.
1. Thin target
When using a very thin target, the secondary reactions
that contribute to the fragment of interest are negligible,
i:e:, both the second and third terms on the right side of
Eq. (A1) can be omitted. Together with Eq. (A2), NF(x)
is then determined as

be noted that Eq. (A3) can be simplied by expanding

incident beam can be safely neglected; then Eq. (A3)
becomes
NF(x) =N0(0)P

2. Thick target
With the target thickness xincreasing, secondary reac-
tions have to be considered as depicted in Eq. (A1). The
incident nuclei may undergo cascade fragmentation pro-
cess to produce the nal fragment of interest, as shown
by the second term of Eq. (A1). Here by omitting more
than two-step cascade fragmentation process, the frag-
ment yield from such two-step cascade fragmentation can
be computed as follows:

F(x) is the

on the right side of Eq. (A1); namely, the contributions
from the second term are negligibly smaller compared to
that from the rst and third terms.
Let us then consider the special case in which the sec-
ond term is neglected.  Z= 1 is one of such cases.
One can see that the second term accounts for about 8%
(0.4%) of the third (rst) term for  Z= 1 (see Table II).Then Eq. (A1) can be rewritten as

rection of the scaling factor [31]. The variances of 5%

To have a quantitative understanding, we take FRACS
model as an example to calculate the cross section, P
Z,
and obtain the relevant NFfrom Eqs. (A3), (A5), (A9),
and (A11), respectively. Table II summarizes the calcu-
latedNFof the elemental fragments with  Z= 1-6 for
218 MeV/nucleon28Si on carbon target with a thickness
of 1.86 g/cm2. One can see that NFdeduced by Eq. (A9)
represents the "true" EFCS, while NFfrom (A11) gives
the lower limit to that from Eq. (A9). For smaller  Z,
NFfrom Eq. (A11) is similar to the one from Eq. (A9)
in magnitude. This is due to the fact that the second
term in Eq. (A1) (i.e., the yield from the higher- Zfrag-
ment due to multistep reactions) plays a minor role. For
larger Z,NFfrom Eq. (A3) is almost identical to the
one from Eq. (A9). This is due to the cancellation of con-
tributions from the second and third terms in Eq. (A1).
Moreover, the results from Eq. (A5) tend to be overes-
timated compared with those from Eqs. (A3) and (A9).
Using Eq. (A5) to derive EFCS, as often done in EFCS
determination, would therefore give an underestimated
cross section, when the beam attenuation eect is sig-
nicant. We also examine the predictions by employing
EPAX3, modied EPAX2, and Abrasion-Ablation mod-
els, and nd that the above conclusions hold well, al-
though the absolute values dier.
As long as the absolute value of the second term
is smaller than that of the third one in Eq. (A1), the
\true" EFCS lies always in between those determined
from Eqs. (A3) and (A11), which set the lower and upper
boundaries of EFCS, respectively. The exception could
occur at relatively large  Zand/or the thick target, as
Z= 6 in Table II. To verify this, we compute NFex-
plicitly against the target thickness xfor Z= 6, in
which the contribution from the second term in Eq. (A1)
could be more signicant and be comparable to the third
term. Again, the FRACS model is employed to calculate
the relevant cross sections. In Fig. 8, one can see that NF
derived from Eqs. (A3), (A5), (A9), and (A11) increases
monotonically with increasing target thickness x.
We takeNFderived from Eq. (A9) as a reference, and
plot the ratios relative to NFfrom Eqs. (A3), (A5), and
(A11) in the inset of Fig. 8. Overall, the ratios of both
Eq. (A3)/Eq. (A9) and Eq. (A11)/Eq. (A9) are less than
1 and decrease monotonically with the increment of tar-
get thickness x. This indicates that NFfrom Eq. (A3)
is no longer a good upper limit for  Z= 6 when em-
ploying the FRACS predictions, although the deviation
remains small. Quantitatively, for a very thin target, NF
deduced by Eqs. (A3), (A5), and (A11) have insignif-
icant discrepancies from that by Eq. (A9). When the
target thickness is less than 0.3 g/cm2, both the beam
attenuation eect and secondary reactions in the target
induce less than 1% variance. In such case, Eq. (A3) or
even Eq. (A5) can be used for the deduction of absolute

cross sections with a good accuracy. As the target thick-
nessxincreases, however, the inuence of these eects
onNFbecomes signicant. When the target thickness
is 1.86 g/cm2, the eect solely due to the beam attenua-
tion eect in the target can result in a deviation of 5.3%.
In addition to the beam attenuation eect, neglecting ei-
ther both the second and third terms or the second term
in Eq. (A1) can lead to an additional deviation of 1%
or 5% [see Eq. (A3)/Eq. (A9) and Eq. (A11)/Eq. (A9)],
respectively.
3. EFCS and uncertainty
We found that Eq. (A5) is not a reliable way to deduce
the EFCS, and a systematic overestimation up to 10%
can be introduced, in particular for a thick target and/or
for large charge changes  Z. The nal centroid values of
EFCS are recommended to be calculated by Eq. (A3) for
Z= 1-2, by averaging the cross sections obtained from
Eqs. (A3) and (A11) for  Z= 3-4, and by Eq. (A11)12
for Z= 5-6. For the sake of reliability, the eects in-
duced by the beam attenuation and secondary reactions
in the target and by the data interpretation approaches
are evaluated as systematic uncertainty. The former is
taken as the half of the dierence of cross sections from
Eqs. (A3) and (A11), while the latter is determined as
half of the dierence of cross sections in two dierenttting methods for  Z= 1-6. Both are then added in
quadrature to the systematic uncertainty, which is gen-
erally smaller than the statistical uncertainty. In reality,
one should use Eqs. (A4) and (A12) to remove the back-
ground events. Finally, the EFCS determination in the
experimental condition is summarized in Table III.
