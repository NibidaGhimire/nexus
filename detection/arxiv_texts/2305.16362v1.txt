Abstract
We propose an automated computational algorithm for simultaneous model selection and parameter identification
for the hyperelastic mechanical characterization of human brain tissue. Following the motive of the recently proposed
computational framework EUCLID (E fficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identitication and Discovery) and in
contrast to conventional parameter calibration methods, we construct an extensive set of candidate hyperelastic mod-
els, i.e., a model library including popular models known from the literature, and develop a computational strategy
for automatically selecting a model from the library that conforms to the available experimental data while being
represented as an interpretable symbolic mathematical expression. This computational strategy comprises sparse re-
gression, i.e., a regression problem that is regularized by a sparsity promoting penalty term that filters out irrelevant
models from the model library, and a clustering method for grouping together highly correlated and thus redundant
features in the model library. The model selection procedure is driven by labelled data pairs stemming from mechan-
ical tests under di fferent deformation modes, i.e., uniaxial compression /tension and simple torsion, and can thus be
interpreted as a supervised counterpart to the originally proposed EUCLID that is informed by full-field displacement
data and global reaction forces. The proposed method is verified on synthetical data with artificial noise and validated
on experimental data acquired through mechanical tests of human brain specimens, proving that the method is capa-
ble of discovering hyperelastic models that exhibit both high fitting accuracy to the data as well as concise and thus
interpretable mathematical representations.

1. Introduction
Despite extensive research over the past decades, the characterization of the mechanical response of biological
tissues like those of the human brain remains an active field with many open questions, see the review article by
Budday et al. (2020). The amount of data is usually limited by ethical restrictions and by the availability of only
few specimens with short durability (Faber et al., 2022). The general objective is therefore to leverage these limited
data in an e fficient manner to discover an adequate mathematical description of the tissue response. The conventional
strategy is to a priori assume a constitutive model and to calibrate the tunable model parameters by means of the
experimental measurements. However, the a priori choice of the constitutive model is driven by human experience
and intuition; thus, this classical strategy is highly susceptible to introducing modeling errors that lead to poor fitting

and machine learning approaches promise a powerful remedy. In this work, one of such methods, which falls under
the umbrella of methods denoted as EUCLID (E fficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery)
(Flaschel et al., 2021), is used for automatically discovering symbolic expressions of hyperelastic material models for
human brain tissue based on experimental measurements.
The general idea behind machine-learning-based material modeling is to choose a model ansatz that exhibits a
high expressiveness owing to a vast amount of tunable parameters, and to calibrate these parameters by leveraging
the available data. Popular examples of versatile machine-learning-based material models include neural networks
(Ghaboussi et al., 1991), splines (Sussman and Bathe, 2009), Gaussian processes (Frankel et al., 2020), and neural
ordinary di fferential equations (Tac et al., 2022). In the context of hyperelasticity, these methods can be used to learn
the characteristic strain energy density function while special attention needs to be attributed to not violating physical
constraints like objectivity or (poly-)convexity of the strain energy density function (As’ad et al., 2022; Klein et al.,
2022a,b; Kalina et al., 2022; Thakolkaran et al., 2022; Chen and Guilleminot, 2022; Linka and Kuhl, 2022; As’ad and
Farhat, 2022; Tac et al., 2022). Until now, the majority of the proposed machine learning models for hyperelasticy
are informed by artificially generated data, e.g., data generated through simulations at the microscopic level. An
exception is for example the work by Linka et al. (2021), who train neural networks based on real experimental data
for the characterization of human brain tissue. In contrast to machine-learning-based approaches stand model-free
data-driven methods (Kirchdoerfer and Ortiz, 2016; Iba ˜nez et al., 2018), which seek to avoid the formulation of a
material model altogether by solving forward problems that are directly informed by the data.
Both the previously mentioned machine-learning-based approaches as well as model-free data-driven methods
have in common that the constitutive behavior is encoded in a black box that does not allow for physical interpreta-
tion, e.g., it is di fficult to interpret the meaning of the many functions and parameters that compose models encoded
in machine learning tools like neural networks. Furthermore, these methods typically rely on a vast amount of labeled
data pairs that are not available under experimental conditions. The recognition of these issues motivated the devel-
opment of the EUCLID method, which aims to discover interpretable symbolic expressions of material models using
only experimentally available data like displacement fields and global reaction forces. Initially applied to hyperelas-
ticity (Flaschel et al., 2021; Joshi et al., 2022) (see also the related and independent work by Wang et al. (2021)),
the framework was later extended to viscoelasticity (Marino et al., 2023), elastoplasticity (Flaschel et al., 2022), and
generalized standard materials (Flaschel et al., 2023), see Flaschel (2023) for an overview. Recently, discovering sym-
bolic expressions for material models is gaining more and more attention in the field, see, e.g., the works by Bomarito
et al. (2021); Kabliman et al. (2021); Park and Cho (2021); Abdusalamov et al. (2023); Meyer and Ekre (2023).
In this work, EUCLID is used to automatically discover hyperelastic strain energy density functions for describing
the mechanical behavior of human brain tissue. The idea is to construct a set of candidate material models called
the model library, which can be assembled for example from the vast available literature on hyperelastic material
models (see the non-comprehensive list of reviewing articles by Boyce and Arruda (2000); Marckmann and Verron
(2006); Steinmann et al. (2012); Dal et al. (2021); He et al. (2021)), and to use a specifically designed algorithm,
based on sparse regression and feature clustering, to select from the library a material model which is encoded by
an interpretable, simple mathematical expression and which is able to well capture the mechanical behavior observed
in the experimental data. Due to the wet and shiny surface of brain tissues, displacement field data are di fficult to
acquire; thus, against the original philosophy of EUCLID (Flaschel, 2023), the method in this paper is not informed
by full-field displacement and global reaction force data. Instead, we rely here on labeled data pairs stemming from
uniaxial compression /tension and simple torsion tests of human brain tissue specimens.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we construct the model library in which EUCLID searches for a
suitable material model. In Section 2, the proposed algorithm for model selection is discussed in detail. Subsequently,
the method is tested on artificial data and actual experimental data in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively, and
conclusions are drawn in Section 6.
Notation : Tensors and matrices may appear in compact or index notation, e.g., ForFi j, respectively. In compact
notation, first-order tensors (vectors) and second-order tensors are denoted by bold letters, e.g., F. The transpose of a
tensor is denoted by □T. When appearing in index notation, the order of the tensor equals the number of the indices.
2If not stated otherwise, the Einstein convention for summation over repeated indices is used in equations appearing
in index notation, e.g., aibi=P
iaibi. Inner products are denoted by ·, e.g., a·b=aibi, and outer products by ⊗,
e.g.,{a⊗b}i j=aibj. If no operation is indicated between two tensors, the juxtaposition implies tensor contraction,
e.g.,{FTF}i j=FkiFk j. The trace of a tensor is denoted by tr( □), e.g., tr( C)=Cii, the volumetric part by vol( □), the
deviatoric part by dev( □), and the determinant by det( □).
2. Model library
2.1. Strain energy density
The constitutive response of a hyperelastic material is completely characterized by the material strain energy
density function. In the spirit of EUCLID, we construct a material model library, i.e., a large set of potential candi-
date material models, by introducing a general parametric ansatz for the unknown strain energy density. Under the
assumption of incompressibility, the strain energy density Wof a hyperelastic material is postulated as (Holzapfel,
2000)
W=˜W(F)−p·(J−1), (1)
where Fis the deformation gradient, pis a scalar Lagrange multiplier that can be physically interpreted as the hydro-
static (or volumetric) pressure, and J=detF!=1 is the determinant of the deformation gradient. A su fficient condition
to satisfy the objectivity requirement for the material model is that Wdepends on Fthrough the right Cauchy-Green
tensor C=FTF, i.e. ˜W(F)=ˆW(C). Assuming furthermore isotropic material behavior, the contribution ˆWcan be
expressed as a function of the invariants of C, defined as I1=tr(C),I2=1
2(tr2(C)−tr(C2)) and I3=det(C). An
equally objective possibility for isotropic hyperelasticity is to express the strain energy density as a function of the
principal stretches λ1,λ2,λ3defined as the eigenvalues of the right stretch tensor U, which in turn is defined through
the polar decomposition F=RU(Holzapfel, 2000). As we seek to avoid a priori assumptions on the material re-
sponse, we do not limit ourselves to a strain energy density that depends solely on the strain invariants or solely on
the principal stretches, but instead consider the general case in which the strain energy density includes a contribution
˜WIthat depends on the strain invariants and a contribution ˜Wλthat depends on the principal stretches
W=˜WI(I1,I2,I3)+˜Wλ(λ1,λ2,λ3)−p·(J−1). (2)
By doing so, we obtain a highly general expression for the strain energy density that encompasses many well-known
hyperelastic constitutive models e.g. of the Mooney-Rivlin or Ogden types.
To introduce a general parametric ansatz for ˜WI, we assume that it can be expressed as a linear combination of a
priori chosen nonlinear feature functions
˜WI(I1,I2,I3)=θI·QI(I1,I2,I3), (3)
where the nonlinear feature functions have been collected in the vector QIandθIis a vector of unknown real-valued
material parameters. We construct the feature vector QIsuch that it contains features of the generalized Mooney-
Rivlin model (Rivlin, 1947) and a logarithmic feature as it appears in the Gent-Thomas model (Gent and Thomas,
1958)
QI(I1,I2,I3)=h
(I1−3)m(I2−3)n−m:n∈{1,..., NMooney},m∈{0,..., n}iT
|                                                                          {z                                                                          }

logarithmic feature, (4)
where⊕denotes vector concatenation and the choice of NMooney dictates the size of the feature vector. This selection
of feature functions was proven in Flaschel et al. (2021) to have a high approximation power. We choose NMooney =3
in this work, such that θIcomprises 10 unknown parameters.
To obtain a general parametric ansatz for the principal stretch dependent contribution ˜Wλ, we consider the gener-
alized Ogden model (Ogden, 1972)
˜Wλ(λ1,λ2,λ3)=NOgdenX
i=12µi
α2

λαi
1+λαi

, (5)
3whereµiandαiare unknown real-valued material parameters and NOgden is the number of considered terms in the gen-
eralized Ogden model. In contrast to the model library chosen in Eq. (3), the strain energy density of the generalized
Ogden model depends nonlinearly on the unknown material parameters. In general, this complicates the inference of
the material parameters from experimental measurements. Therefore, we assume in the following an a priori fixed
set of NOgden distinct values of αi. By choosing NOgden sufficiently large, it is expected that this assumption does
not significantly restrict the versatility of the model library. In this work, we choose NOgden =2·104values ofαi
evenly distributed between −100 and 100 excluding zero, i.e., αi∈{− 100,−99.99,...,−0.01,0.01,..., 99.99,100}.
With this assumption, µiremain the only unknowns in the model ansatz for ˜Wλwhich can now be written as a linear
combination of nonlinear feature functions
˜Wλ(λ1,λ2,λ3)=θλ·Qλ(λ1,λ2,λ3), (6)
where the nonlinear feature functions have been collected in the vector Qλwith components
{Qλ(λ1,λ2,λ3)}i=λαi
1+λαi
2+λαi
3−3, (7)
andθλis a vector of unknown real-valued material parameters that are related to the parameters µithrough{θλ}i=

i.
By defining
θ="θI
θλ#
,Q="QI(I1,I2,I3)
Qλ(λ1,λ2,λ3)#
, (8)
the model library for the strain energy density can be written as
W=θ·Q−p·(J−1). (9)
To ensure that the strain energy density describes physically meaningful material behavior, we assume that θi≥0
for all i. The non-negativity of the material parameters is a su fficient (but not necessary) requirement for stability, see
Hartmann (2001).
2.2. Stress-strain relation
After having defined the strain energy density, a bijective relation between the kinematic state and the stress state
of the material is obtained through its di fferentiation. Specifically, the Piola stress Pis computed by di fferentiating W
with respect to the deformation gradient
P=∂W
∂F=∂˜W
∂F−pF−T, (10)
where we used∂J
∂F=JF−T. Noting that ˜W=θ·Q=θI·QI+θλ·Qλ, we apply the chain rule to obtain
∂˜W
∂Fi j=θI· ∂QI
∂Ia∂Ia
∂Fi j!
+θλ· ∂Qλ
∂λb∂λb
∂Fi j!
. (11)
The derivatives of the strain invariants and of the principal stretches are provided in Appendix A.1 and Appendix
A.2, respectively. The derivatives of the feature vectors follow in Appendix A.3. The Cauchy stress Tis calculated
from the Piola stress as T=PFT.
2.2.1. Uniaxial compression and tension
Experimental measurements of specimens under uniaxial compression and tension deliver labeled data pairs in the
form ( uUT,F), where uUTis the longitudinal displacement at the displacement controlled end of the specimen and F
is the resulting force. Data pairs of the form ( λUT,P11), whereλUTis the longitudinal stretch applied to the specimen
andP11is the longitudinal normal component of the Piola stress, are obtained through
λUT=uUT+h
h,P11=F
πr2

4where handroutare the height and the outer radius of the undeformed specimen, respectively. The previously intro-
duced material model library can be used to derive a relation P11(λUT;θ) that links the experimental inputs λUTand
outputs P11depending on the material parameters θ.
Applying a longitudinal stretch λUTto the specimen implies that F11=λUTand, due to symmetry, F22=F33. As
a result of the incompressibility assumption det F!=1, the deformation gradient under uniaxial compression /tension
must hence be
FUT=λUT 0 0
01√λUT0
0 01√λUT. (13)
The kinematic state is thus completely determined by the applied longitudinal stretch.
To obtain the relationship P11(λUT;θ), the unknown hydrostatic pressure pin Eq. (10) needs to be computed. As
the material is allowed to freely deform in the x2- and x3-directions, it is P22=P33!=0. This condition is used along
with Eq. (10)
P33=∂˜W
∂F33−pF−1
33!=0, (14)
to find the hydrostatic pressure
p=∂˜W
∂F33F33. (15)
We hence obtain the desired relationship by substituting the pressure in Eq. (10)
P11(λUT;θ)=∂˜W
∂F11−pF−1
11=∂˜W

where we denoted all the terms that depend on the longitudinal stretch as Q′
UT(λUT). This can be interpreted as a
feature function derivative vector whose scalar product with the material parameters computes the longitudinal normal
component of the Piola stress. More information for computing Q′
UT(λUT) is provided in Appendix A.4.
2.2.2. Simple torsion
Now we consider a cylindrical specimen in a cylindrical coordinate system ( r,ϑ,z), where ris the radial coordinate,
ϑis the polar angle, and zis the longitudinal coordinate. Assuming the specimen to undergo simple torsion around the
z-axis, experimental measurements on specimens under simple torsion deliver labeled data pairs in the form ( ϕ,M),
whereϕis the applied angle of deformation at the sheared end of the specimen and Mis the resulting torque. The twist
ψof the specimen can be deduced from the applied angle of deformation through ψ=ϕ/h. The data is transformed
into data pairs of the form ( ˜ψ,τ), where ˜ψ=routψandτ=M/r3
outare respectively a normalized twist and normalized
torque.
After normalizing the radial coordinate through ρ=r/rout, the deformation gradient in the cylindrical coordinate
system then reads (Hartmann, 2001)
FST=FrrFrϑFrz
FϑrFϑϑFϑz

The material model library can be used to derive a relation τ(˜ψ;θ) that links the experimental inputs ˜ψand outputs τ
depending on the material parameters θ.
The normalized torque is given by
τ=Z1
02πρ2Tϑzdρ, (18)
5where the component of the Cauchy stress Tϑzis, due to Eq. (17),
Tϑz=PϑiFzi=Pϑz. (19)
With reference to Eq. (10), we notice that there is no hydrostatic pressure contribution to Pϑzunder simple torsion,
such that
Tϑz=∂W
∂Fϑz=∂˜W
∂Fϑz=θ·∂Q
∂Fϑz. (20)
We finally obtain the desired relationship τ(˜ψ;θ) by substituting Eq. (20) in Eq. (18)
τ(˜ψ;θ)=θ·Z1

ST(˜ψ), (21)
where we denoted all the terms that depend on the twist as Q′
ST(˜ψ). This can be interpreted as a feature function deriva-
tive vector whose scalar product with the material parameters computes the normalized torque. More information for
computing Q′
ST(˜ψ) is provided in Appendix A.5.
3. Model discovery
After having defined the material model library, i.e., a versatile ansatz for the hyperelastic strain energy density,
we seek an optimal choice of the material model parameters θ. Specifically, in the spirit of EUCLID - see Flaschel
et al. (2021) - we seek a parameter vector θwhich leads at the same time to a small mismatch between the material
model predictions and the experimental measurements, and to a simple discovered material model, i.e. one with a
small number of terms. Unlike in the original work on EUCLID (Flaschel et al., 2021), in which the model selection
was driven by a physics-informed optimization problem that was fed by unlabelled data, in this paper, labelled data
pairs (i.e., stress versus strain data pairs under uniaxial compression /tension, and twist versus torque data pairs under
simple torsion) are available to drive the model selection. Thus, the method proposed here can be interpreted as a
supervised counterpart to the originally proposed EUCLID. The proposed algorithm for inferring θis described in the
following and a step-by-step overview is provided in Appendix B, see Fig. B.10.
3.1. Model-data mismatch
First, a quantitative measure of the mismatch between the material model predictions and the experimental mea-
surements needs to be introduced. In the case of uniaxial compression /tension, the measurements are provided in the
form of pairs ( λ(l)
UT,P(l)
11) for a number of load steps l=1,..., nUT. Eq. (16) provides a mapping between the input and
output data, thus leading to nUTequations
P11(λ(l)
UT;θ)=P(l)
11. (22)
Noting that each of the equations above depends linearly on θ, we write them as a linear system of equations
AUTθ=bUT, (23)

Analogously, in the case of simple torsion, the measurements are provided in the form of pairs ( ˜ψ(l),τ(l)) for a number
of load steps l=1,..., nST. Eq. (21) provides a mapping between the input and output data, thus leading to nST
equations
τ(˜ψ(l);θ)=τ(l). (25)
6which can be expressed once again as a linear system of equations
ASTθ=bST, (26)

The linear systems in Eq. (23) and Eq. (26) are concatenated to the system Aθ=bwith
A="rUTAUT
rSTAST#
,b="rUTbUT
rSTbST#
, (28)
where rUT>0 and rST>0 scale the contributions of the uniaxial compression /tension data and the simple torsion
data, respectively. During the experimental investigations conducted in the context of this work (see, e.g., Section 5),
the chosen range of applied deformation in uniaxial compression /tension and simple torsion led to measurements
bUTandbST, respectively, that were di fferent in magnitude. Choosing rUT=0.3 and rST=1 was found to result
in a proper scaling of the contributions from uniaxial compression /tension and simple torsion, leading to similar
maximum absolute entries in the scaled measurements rUTbUTandrSTbST. Finally, the total mismatch between the
material model prediction and the experimental measurements is quantified by computing the mean squared error
MSE of the residuals of the linear system of equations
MSE( θ)=1
nUT+nST∥Aθ−b∥2
2. (29)
3.2. Feature scaling
To obtain a system of equations with dimensionless parameters and system coe fficients, we standardize the system
of equations. Defining the mean and standard deviation of a vector x∈Rnas
Mean( x)=1
nX
ixi,Std(x)=s
1
nX
i(xi−Mean( x))2, (30)
the standardized system of equations reads
¯A¯θ=¯b (31)
with
¯Ai j=Ai j
Std(Aj),¯bi=bi
Std(b),¯θj=Std(Aj)
Std(b)θj, (32)
where we defined Ajas the jthcolumn of A. The mean squared error of the residuals of the standardized linear system
of equations is defined as
MSE( ¯θ)=1
nUT+nST∥¯A¯θ−¯b∥2
2. (33)
3.3. Optimization problem
Our objectives are to calibrate the unknown material parameters such that the material model is in agreement with
the experimental data, and to discard those terms in the model ansatz which have a minor influence on the fitting
accuracy by setting their corresponding parameters to zero. To this end, we solve an L1-regularized optimization
problem (also denoted as sparse regression problem) of the form
¯θopt=arg min
¯θ≥0 1
2MSE( ¯θ)+λp∥¯θ∥1!
, (34)
7where MSE( ¯θ) is the previously introduced mean squared error function that quantifies the mismatch between the
material model predictions and the experimental data, and ∥¯θ∥1=P
i|¯θi|is an L1-regularization term, also denoted
asLasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). This term, first used for model selection by Frank and
Friedman (1993) and Tibshirani (1996) and later applied to problems in dynamics by Brunton et al. (2016), can
be interpreted as a convex approximation of an operator that counts the number of nonzero entries in the material
parameter vector. Thus, adding the L1-regularization term to the minimization problem promotes sparsity of the
material parameter vector. In previous works (Flaschel et al., 2021, 2022), the more general Lp-regularization term
∥¯θ∥p
p=P
i|¯θi|pwith 0<p≤1 was adopted to promote sparsity in the solution vector. The Lpterm has the advantage
that it converges to the operator that counts the number of nonzero entries in the material parameter vector as p
approaches zero. Thus, it can be considered as a better measure of sparsity than the L1-regularization term. However,
theLpterm is non-convex for p<1; this implies that the optimization problem becomes non-convex and thus multiple
solutions are to be expected, corresponding to local minima of the objective function. In our previous papers (Flaschel
et al., 2021, 2022), this issue was addressed by solving the optimization problem multiple times and selecting the
minimum of the computed local minima, which obviously increases the computational complexity and cost of the
minimization problem. In this work, we rely on the L1regularization term and thus solve a convex minimization
problem which thus admits a unique solution. The influence of the regularization is governed by the choice of the
weighting factor λp≥0. As proposed in Flaschel et al. (2022, 2023); Marino et al. (2023), an appropriate choice
ofλpfor striking a balance between fitting accuracy and mathematical complexity of the material model is obtained
through a Pareto analysis (see Section 3.5).
3.4. Solver
To solve the problem in Eq. (34), we leverage a coordinate descent algorithm as proposed by Friedman et al.
(2010), which is implemented in the Lasso subroutine of the open-source Python library sklearn . The subroutine
takes ¯Aand¯bas well as the value of λpas input and returns the sparse solution vector ¯θwhose entries are constrained
to be greater than or equal to zero. The intercept in the Lasso subroutine is turned o ffand the maximum number of
iterations is set to 104.
Figure 1: Qualitative illustration of the Pareto analysis for selecting an appropriate value of λp.
3.5. Pareto analysis
The solution of the problem in Eq. (34) is highly dependent on the choice of λp. As qualitatively illustrated in
Fig. 1, a small value of λpyields a dense solution vector and therefore a complex expression for the material model
that is in general associated with a high fitting accuracy, i.e., a small mean squared error. Increasing the value of λp
results in a sparser solution vector and thus a simpler expression for the material model at the cost of a reduced fitting
accuracy with a larger mean squared error. In the limit of very large values of λp, the optimization problem returns a
solution vector with only zero entries and the mean squared error saturates.
To strike a balance between the accuracy and the complexity of the material model, a Pareto analysis is applied
to the problem. To this end, the problem in Eq. (34) is solved multiple times using a set of di fferentλpvalues,
8leading to a solution vector ¯θfor every choice of λp. Here, we choose 41 values of λpthat are evenly distributed on
a logarithmic scale between 10−2and 102. Our objective now is to select from all solutions the one that exhibits an
optimal combination of high fitting accuracy and high sparsity. To this end, the mean squared error and the L1-norm
of the solution vector are computed for each solution. The minimum and maximum mean squared errors among all
solutions are denoted as MSE minandMSE max, respectively. Further, we define a threshold mean squared error (see
Fig. 1) as
MSE th=MSE min+rλ(MSE max−MSE min), (35)
where rλis a small positive scalar, 0 <rλ≪1. All solutions for which the mean squared errors are greater than this
threshold are expected to exhibit a low fitting accuracy and are thus discarded. From the remaining solutions, i.e.,
those for which the mean squared error is below MSE th, we select the sparsest one, i.e., the solution with the lowest
value of the L1-norm term (see Fig. 1). In this way, a sparse solution with a low mean squared error is obtained,
whereby the amount of sparsity is dictated by the user-defined hyperparameter rλ. In this work we set rλ=0.02 and
keep it constant throughout the analyses.
3.6. Thresholding
The solution vector ¯θselected in Section 3.5 may contain values that are close to zero. As these material parameters
and their corresponding features have a vanishing e ffect on the model response, they are set to zero. Specifically, we
define a threshold value ¯θth(here chosen as ¯θth=0.01) and we set ¯θi=0 if¯θi<¯θthfor all i.
3.7. Feature clustering
Due to the fine discretization of the chosen range of αivalues (see Section 2), the feature library contains Ogden
features with very similar values of αi, which in turn results in a high correlation between these features. While the
solution vector obtained by solving the optimization problem with Lasso regularization already exhibits a high degree
of sparsity, the sparsity and thus interpretability of the material model can be further improved by grouping together
highly correlated features in the solution. To this end, we leverage a clustering algorithm that automatically groups
together similar αivalues, as qualitatively illustrated in Fig. 2. For a similar clustering strategy that was used to group
together similar Maxwell elements in viscoelastic constitutive laws discovered with EUCLID, the interested reader is
referred to Marino et al. (2023).
Figure 2: Qualitative illustration of the feature clustering.
In this paper, we adopt the clustering method DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with
Noise) (Ester et al., 1996) as implemented in the Python library sklearn .DBSCAN assigns each αiwhose correspond-
ing{¯θλ}iis non-zero to a cluster. This is done in such a way that for each αiin a cluster there exists at least one value
αj(with i,j) in the same cluster such that their distance |αi−αj|is smaller than or equal to a predefined value, here
chosen as 0.01. The advantage over the k-means clustering algorithm used in Marino et al. (2023) is that the needed
9number of clusters is obtained automatically. After grouping the αivalues into a set of clusters, an averaged value ¯ α
is computed for each cluster as
¯α=P
kαk{¯θλ}kP
k{¯θλ}k, (36)
where kranges over all elements in the considered cluster. Afterwards, ¯ αis rounded to the closest original value of αi
contained in the material model library (see Section 2). Thus, we identify for each cluster one value of αifor which
the corresponding coe fficient in ¯θλis non-zero, while all other entries in ¯θλare set to zero.
3.8. Final regression without regularization
By solving the sparse regression problem and applying the clustering method, a small number of relevant fea-
tures are automatically selected from the originally large library of candidate features. In a final step, all features
corresponding to parameters that have been identified as zero are disregarded from the library by removing the corre-
sponding columns from the matrix ¯A, thus obtaining a reduced system matrix ¯Ared. Afterwards, the reduced regression
problem is solved for the remaining non-zero parameters ¯θred, but this time without introducing any regularization term
(i.e., we solve Eq. (34) with λp=0).
The motivation behind this last step is twofold. First, while the regularization term in Eq. (34) forces unneeded
parameters to zero, it simultaneously shrinks the absolute value of the relevant parameters. Solving the regression
problem without regularization for the small number of selected features leads to material parameters that are not
affected by such shrinkage. And second, after applying the clustering method, most entries in ¯θλhave been identified
as zero, while the remaining non-zero parameters in ¯θλare still unknown. The final regression problem without
regularization is used to calibrate those non-zero parameters. Finally, the original parameters θcan be recovered from
the scaled parameters ¯θusing Eq. (32).
4. Numerical verification
4.1. Synthetical data
Before applying the proposed method for material model discovery to experimental data, we verify the method on
synthetically generated data without and with artificially added noise. Such data are obtained by assuming di fferent
hyperelastic material models and generating labeled data pairs under the assumption of uniaxial compression /tension
and simple torsion. Specifically, we consider the four material models whose strain energy density functions are
provided in Table 1:
•first-order Mooney-Rivlin model (MR1)
•one-term Ogden model (O1)
•two-term Ogden model (O2)
•combination of second-order Mooney-Rivlin model and one-term Ogden model (MR2O1)
The chosen material models are used to generate nUT=60 pairs of data for uniaxial compression /tension, i.e.,
(λ(l)
UT,P(l)
11), where the values of λ(l)
UTare equally spaced between λ(1)
UT=0.7 andλ(nUT)
UT=1.3, and nST=60 pairs of data
for simple torsion, i.e., ( ˜ψ(l),τ(l)), where the values of ˜ψ(l)are equally spaced between ˜ψ(1)=−1 and ˜ψ(nST)=1.
To emulate real experimental data, the generated data are perturbed by artificial noise by considering noisy data
pairs (λ(l)
UT,P(l)
11+ε(l)
UT) and ( ˜ψ(l),τ(l)+ε(l)
ST), whereε(l)
UT∼N

andε(l)

is random noise that is drawn
independently from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation σ. Here, we consider (beside the
noiseless case) two di fferent levels of noise, i.e. σ∈{0 Pa,5 Pa,10 Pa}.
104.2. Results and discussion
The synthetically generated data serve as input for the proposed algorithm for material model discovery. Testing
the method on synthetical data has the advantage that the discovered material models can be compared to the ”ground
truth” (in machine learning jargon), i.e., to the material models that were assumed during data generation. Table 1
shows the expressions of the discovered strain energy density functions in comparison with the true ones. It is observed
that the correct mathematical form of the strain energy density function is recovered for each test case. Table 1 further
provides the mean squared errors that quantify the mismatch between the data and the predictions of the discovered
models. As expected, the MSE increases for increasing level of noise.

For the benchmark case MR1, the material coe fficients in the strain energy density function are exactly recovered
for the noiseless case. The deviation between the true and identified parameters increases for increasing noise, as
expected. For the benchmark cases O1 and MR2O1, the true and discovered parameters are in excellent agreement.
However, the material parameters are not exactly recovered even in the noiseless case. The reason for this is that
computing the averaged values ¯ αafter the feature clustering (Section 3.7) cannot exactly recover the ground truth
exponents in the Ogden terms, which leads to small deviations in the identified parameters. For the benchmark case
O2, the true and identified parameters exhibit slightly larger deviations. One explanation for these deviations could be
that the model library comprises many material models and many combinations of material parameters that are equally
suited to describe the material response. The proposed algorithm does not guarantee to find exactly the same model
and parameters that were assumed during data generation, but may instead provide an adequate surrogate model that is
equally suited to predict the data. We emphasise that, although the true and identified material parameters show some
deviations, the MSE for the benchmark case O2 is similar to the MSE for the other benchmarks. Thus, the deviation
in the model parameters does not seem to seriously a ffect the fitting accuracy of the model.

Figure 3: Stretch versus stress response under uniaxial compression /tension and (normalized) twist versus torque response under simple torsion of
the discovered material models in comparison with the synthetical data (noise level σ=10 Pa).
Fig. 3 illustrates the material response of the discovered material models in direct comparison with the syntheti-
cally generated data for the case with the highest level of noise, revealing an excellent agreement.
12In the following, we discuss in more detail some of the intermediate steps in the sparsity promoting algorithm
for material model discovery (see Steps 3-8 in Fig. B.10) in the context of benchmark case MR2O1 with noise level
σ=10 Pa. Fig. 4 illustrates the Pareto analysis, which is leveraged for the choice of the hyperparameter λpin
the sparse regression problem. It can be seen that the mean squared error MSE increases and the L1-norm of the
material parameter vector ∥¯θ∥1decreases for increasing values of λp. For values of λpexceeding approximately 1, the
material parameter vector obtained from the solution of the sparse regression problem contains all zeros, so that its
L1-norm remains constant at zero and the corresponding MSE saturates. Using the method described in Section 3.5,
the appropriate value of λpis chosen such that the selected model exhibits both a high fitting accuracy and a low
model complexity. Note also that for values of λplower than the chosen one, the MSE is very weakly sensitive to the
specific choice of λp.
Figure 4: Illustration of the Pareto analysis for benchmark case MR2O1 (noise level σ=10 Pa).
In Fig. 5, the e ffect of the clustering algorithm (see Section 3.7) is illustrated. Before applying the clustering
method, many values of αiare zero while some non-zero values agglomerate in a small region near the ground truth
value (equal to 10, see Table 1). The clustering algorithm identifies these values as one cluster. Afterwards, the values
ofαibelonging to the cluster are averaged, such that the discovered material model exhibits only one Ogden term as
the ground truth model, and the feature coe fficients are calibrated, as illustrated in Section 3.8.

5. Experimental validation
5.1. Experimental data
In the context of this work, we use multi-modal large-strain mechanical testing data from 81 cylindrical specimens
extracted from three di fferent human brains. The data acquisition and preprocessing are briefly described in the
following. For details, the reader is referred to Hinrichsen et al. (2022).
81 cylindrical specimens from di fferent regions of the brain are prepared. Each specimen is labeled by a brain
number and a specimen number as HBE ⟨brain no.⟩⟨specimen no.⟩. The specimens have a radius of approximately
rout≈4 mm. The heights of the specimens and the region that they stem from are recorded in Table C.2.
Fig. 6 shows one of the human brains and an exemplary cylindrical sample before and after mounting it to the
rheometer for the mechanical testing. Each loading mode (compression /tension and torsional shear) consists of three
cycles. Here, we use the data from the third cycle representing the preconditioned material response as brain tissue was
found to show substantial pre-conditioning behavior (Budday et al., 2017). We limit ourselves to hyperelastic material
models (neglecting poro- and viscoelastic e ffects). The strain rates needed to obtain a purely hyperelastic response are

(d) (e)
Figure 6: Experimental setup and data preprocessing. Cylindrical samples (b) are extracted from multiple locations within the human brains (a)
and then mounted to the rheometer (c). The raw data from the rheometer (blue) is preprocessed to obtain the hyperelastic response (orange) (see
(d) and (e)). This is exemplarily shown for a specimen from the motor cortex (HBE 18). First, the noise is reduced using a moving average as
well as a lowpass filter. Subsequently, the hyperelastic response is obtained by averaging the loading and unloading curve.
(in theory infinitely) high or low and therefore not feasible in actual experiments. Thus, the experimental data obtained
from the rheometer shows a considerable hysteresis (see Fig. 6) and we extract the hyperelastic response through a
preprocessing procedure. First, a moving average as well as a low pass filter is applied to reduce high frequency
noises. Afterwards, the hyperelastic response is approximated by the averaged loading and unloading curves (see
also Budday et al. (2017)). The raw data and the extracted hyperelastic response are illustrated in Fig. 6. To reduce
the dimensionality of the data while still preserving the characteristic shape of the curve, we reduce the points per
deformation mode to 60.
This finally leads to a number of nUT=60 data pairs ( λ(l)
UT,P(l)
11) and nST=60 data pairs ( ˜ψ(l),τ(l)) acquired
from the mechanical tests under uniaxial compression /tension and simple torsion, respectively. The values of λ(l)

uniformly distributed between λ(1)
UT=0.85 andλ(nUT)
UT=1.15 and the values of ˜ψ(l)are uniformly distributed between
˜ψ(1)=−0.3 and ˜ψ(nST)=0.3.
5.2. Results and discussion
The proposed algorithm for material model discovery is applied to all experimentally acquired data sets, keeping
all hyperparameters and algorithmic settings constant. The resulting material parameters are listed in Table D.4 and
Table D.5. Many material parameters are identified as zero, meaning that the discovered expressions of the strain
energy density functions are concise and interpretable. The material model discovered for most of the specimens (i.e.,
about 60% of the specimens) is the one-term Ogden model, which has also previously been used to fit human brain
tissue data (Budday et al., 2017, 2020; Hinrichsen et al., 2022). Further models that were identified are the two-term
Ogden model (about 32% of the specimens), and combinations of the one-term Ogden model with a Mooney-Rivlin
term (about 7% of the specimens).
To measure the ability of the discovered material models to fit the given experimental data, the mean squared
errors MSE and MSE are provided in Table D.4 and Table D.5. The scaled mean squared error MSE ranges from a
minimum value of 0 .01 to a maximum value of 0 .71, and the average MSE over all experimental data sets is 0 .17.

Figure 7: Stress versus stretch response under uniaxial compression /tension and torque versus (normalized) twist response under simple torsion of
a discovered material model in comparison with the experimental data. The mean squared error MSE =0.0091 is the smallest in the data set.
Fig. 7 shows the stress versus stretch response under uniaxial compression /tension and torque versus normalized
twist response under simple torsion of a discovered material model for which the value of MSE is small in com-
parison to the other experiments. It is evident that the discovered material model is very well suited to describe the
given data. Fig. 8 shows the same plots for discovered material models for which the values of MSE are close to
the average value of MSE over all experiments. The models are in qualitative agreement with the data. However,
especially for the response under uniaxial compression /tension, the models are not capable to precisely match the
given data. These deviations could possibly be attributed to modeling assumptions that do not hold true during the
mechanical experiments. For example, the geometries of some of the specimens were not ideally cylindrical, because
the softer specimens deformed under their own weight. Further, it was assumed throughout the derivations in this
paper that the strain state in the specimens is homogeneous under uniaxial compression /tension, and it was assumed
that the specimens are fixed in longitudinal direction at the boundaries, but free to move in the transversal directions.
During the experiments, however, both ends of the specimens were glued, meaning that the cross-sectional area of
the specimens remained unchanged at the glued boundaries. Therefore, the sides of the cylindrical specimens bulged
into a barrel shape, resulting in non-homogeneous strain states in the specimens. The constraint that the specimens
are fixed in both longitudinal and transversal directions may add additional sti ffness to the experimentally measured
stress versus stretch response, which could explain the underestimated stress by the discovered material models during
uniaxial compression /tension in Fig. 8. Another source for the disagreement between the discovered models and the
data could be that only isotropic material behavior has been included in the material model library. Thus, possible
effects from material anisotropy in the experimental data cannot be predicted by the discovered models.

for HBE 0129, HBE 0215, HBE 0315, respectively) are close to the average MSE in the data set.

discovered material models in comparison with the experimental data. The mean squared errors ( MSE =0.7064, MSE =0.6107 for HBE 0124,
HBE 0130, respectively) are the largest in the data set.
Finally, Fig. 9 shows the stretch versus stress and normalized twist versus torque plots of discovered material
models for which the value of MSE is large in comparison to the other experiments. As the large mean squared
error indicates, the mismatch between the discovered model and the data is significant. Such large discrepancies
are exceptional for the considered experimental data sets (see Table D.4 and Table D.5). For cyclic shear tests, the
reason for the large deviation between the model and the data could be erroneous experimental measurements: the
two shown samples were not loaded symmetrically during cyclic shear tests but were already twisted before the
shear test started. This can happen when a torque is induced during axial loading (for example due to inhomogeneous
microstructure of the sample). In this case, the rheometer applies a deformation until the torque goes back to zero. The
non-monotonic stress versus stretch response under uniaxial compression /tension in Fig. 9a could be a consequence
of a low signal-to-noise ratio since this sample is very soft. The non-increasing constant stress plateau under uniaxial
compression /tension in Fig. 9c could indicate a failure of the glue that connects the specimen with the testing machine.
6. Conclusion
EUCLID, a recently proposed computational framework for automatically discovering constitutive models as
interpretable symbolic mathematical expressions, was formulated in this work in a supervised setting and validated
on the mechanical testing data of human brain specimens. It was shown that the proposed model selection strategy,
which comprises sparse regression and feature clustering, is able to automatically discover interpretable constitutive
models with satisfactory fitting accuracy to the given uniaxial compression /tension and simple torsion data. The
most commonly discovered model was the one-term Ogden model, which has also previously been widely used to
fit human brain tissue data. The presented results constitute the first experimental validation of EUCLID. However,
several aspects of the proposed method may be improved or extended in future studies. For example, the method
proposed in this work is informed by labeled data pairs due to the limited access to full-field displacement data for
human brain tissues. The experimental validation of EUCLID driven by unlabeled data, i.e., full-field displacement
18and net reaction force data (see Flaschel (2023)), is the subject of ongoing research. Moreover, we restricted the
model library in which EUCLID searches for a model to the class of isotropic hyperelastic models. As the tissue
response is in fact not just hyperelastic but a ffected by dissipative e ffects as well as possibly not perfectly isotropic,
an important future study could be to further generalize the model library, such that EUCLID can not only select a
constitutive model for the human brain tissue within a predefined class of models, but further distinguish between
different modeling classes (such as hyperelasticity, viscoelasticity, elastoplasticity), as shown by Flaschel et al. (2023)
for synthetical data, as well as automatically detect possible anisotropies and identify the corresponding parameters.
