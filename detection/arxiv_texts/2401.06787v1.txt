Abstract : The Internet is currently the largest platform for global communication including expressions of 
opinions, reviews, contents, images, videos and so forth . Moreover, social media has now become a very broad and 
highly engaging platform due to its immense  popularity and swift adoption trend.  Increased social networking, 
however, also has detrimental impacts on the society leading to  a range of unwanted phenomena , such as online 
assault, intimidation, digital bullying, criminality and trolling. Hence, cyberbullying has become a pervasive and 
worrying problem that poses considerable psychological and emotional harm to the people, particularly among st 
the teens and the young adults. In order to lessen its negative effects and provide victims with prompt support, a 
great deal of research to identify cyberbullying instances at various online platforms  is emerging . In comparison to 
other languages, Bangla (also known as  Bengali ) has fewer research studies  in this domain . This study demonstrates 
a deep learning strategy for identifying cyberbullying in Bengali , using a dataset of 12282  versatile comments from 
multiple social media sites. In this study, a two -layer  bidirectional long short -term memory ( Bi-LSTM ) model has 
been built to identify cyberbullying , using a variety of optimisers as well as  5-fold cross validation . To evaluate the 
functionality and efficacy of the proposed system, rigorous assessment and validation procedures have been 
employed throughout the project. The results of this study reveals that the proposed model’s accuracy, using  
momentum -based  stochastic gradient descent ( SGD ) optimi ser, is 94.46% . It also reflects  a higher accuracy of 9 5.08% 
and a F1 score of 9 5.23% using Adam optimi ser as well as a better accuracy of 9 4.31% in 5 -fold cross validation.

1. Introduction  
While various  contemporary technolog ies, such as social media and similar other communication 
platforms , bring us closer to each other  and let us stay connected , they pose multiple serious threats to our 
lives, including cyber bulling  [1,2] . Since the adoption and usage of the  social networking  platforms has 
mushroomed in the recent past years , bullying is no l onger  limited  to the physical space ; rather, social media 
has brought  into being a new model of this tyrannised behaviour, i.e., cyberbullying.  The dissemination of 
unsuitable ph otos,  videos, insulting statements  or messages, threats, etc., using the cyberspace in any form , 
such as  texts, images, voice, videos and  so forth , is considered as cyberbullying . Cyberbullying is the term 
for bullying that occurs online, including on social media, messaging apps, over the voice call, gaming AETiC 2024, Vol. 8, No. 1 51 
www.aetic.theiaer.org  platforms  and mobile devices1. It is a pattern of behaviour intended to frighten, infuriate  or shame those 
who are the target  [3-5]. These cyberbullying behaviours include threats, trolling, information sharing and 
transmission of offensive images or videos. In fact, negative news rapidly spreads and becomes viral much 
faster than any positive ones, resulting in significant nega tive impacts on our lives, including deaths and 
suicidal cases. Therefore, in this technological era, it is extremely important to find efficient approaches and 
develop rapidly functioning tools to identify, detect and stop the spread of such inconsiderate  actions  [6-8]. 
Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Twitter, WeChat, etc. are the 
highly popular ones amongst various age groups and thus act as major source of cyberbullying. In fact, 
there could be various motivations behind cyberbullyin g, including  but not limited to one’s appearance, 
academic or professional achievements, racism, sexuality, financial status, religions , etc. According to the 
recent statistics published by Broadband  Search,  a significant amount of harassment and bullying,  including 
42% on Instagram, 37% on Facebook, 31% on Snapchat, 12% on WhatsApp, 10% on YouTube and 9% on 
Twitter, occur on social media platforms2. According to the Daily Star3, cyberbullying is on the rise in 
Bangladesh, where girls and women make up 80 % of the victims and many of those incidents had led to 
suicide attempt s.  
According to Statista4, during COVID -19 lockdowns, people including kids, engaged with various 
online platforms for 20% additional time compared to that of the pre -pandemic period.  Although the 
COVID -19 pandemic is now over, this has left a long -term effect on us, particularly on how we use online 
platforms to satisfy our needs with regards to recreation and communication. According to data revealed 
by the Peu Research Center5, 71% U.S. parents are concerned about their children aged 11 or younger , as 
they are spending excessive time engaging with  the devices. Besides, numerous social media platforms has 
started to reveal various types of vulgar contents which directly motivate d people to involve in 
cyberbullying.  
Therefore, identifying, detecting, blocking and removing such contents is a matter of grave concern 
and demands extensive continuous research to be conducted, adopting various emerging tools including 
Artificial Intel ligence (AI) based automation technologies.  The aim of this study is to develop a model with 
higher accuracy for detecting cyberbullying in Bengali language using the Bi -LSTM model.  
2. Literature Review  
The influence of information technology on online com munication has resulted in both positive and 
negative outcomes.  Cyberbullying  contribut ed to emotional distress and in extreme cases, like suicide, 
remain a significant concern. This literature review aims to explore existing studies, identify research gap s 
and assess the potential solutions for broader and more effective mitigation of the challenges associated 
with online cyberbullying  [9]. 
Iwendi et al. [10] developed  an advanced  deep learning  system  for identifying obscenities in social 
statements . Bidirectional Long Short -Term  Memory  (Bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units  (GRU), Long Short -
Term  Memory  (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network  (RNN) have been used in their work. However, Bi-
LSTM scored the highest a ccuracy of 82.18%  compared with that of the other model s. 
Balakrishnan et al.  [11] put forward a concept to improve cyberbullying detection using twitter users’ 
psychological features and various machine learning classifiers , such as  Naïve Bayes, Random Forest  and 
J48. Their research demonstrated an  accuracy of 91.88% when users’ sentiments and pers onalities were

www.aetic.theiaer.org  used. However, lack of availability of the users’ sentiment information can reduce the accuracy  of this 
approach . 
Maity et al.  [12] developed a multitask multimodal framework called ‘MT-MM -Bert with VecMap ’, 
based on Bert and VecMap embeddin g techniques for Hindi -English dataset, they obtained 82.05% accuracy 
in cyberbullying detection , 77.87% in sentiment analysis task and 58.05% in emotion recognition task.  
Kumar et al.  [13] proposed a multi-input integrated learning using deep neural networks for 
cyberbullying in real time code -mix data. In their research, they had used different word embedding 
techniques such as GloVe for English, Fast -Text for Hindi. For English data feature extraction, capsule 
network dynamic routing and for H inglish data Bi -LSTM had been used.  
Das et. al  [14] focused on a machine learning model based on encoder -decoder, a renowned NLP tool, 
was developed to classify users’ comments of Facebook pages . Seven numerous types of hate speech were 
found in a sample o f 7,425 comments. For estimating hate speech classifications, th is work  used attention 
mechanisms, LSTM and GRU -based decoders . Among st those algorithms, the attention -based algorithm 
showed  the highest accuracy of 77%.  
 A significant study using several ML and DL techniques including Linear SVC, Logistic Regression, 
Multinomial Naïve Bayes, RF, ANN, and RNN were analysed  by Emon  et al. [15]. The study  showed deep 
learning based  RNN outperforms and gained accuracy 82.20% had been achieved .  
Ahmed et al.  [16] developed two particular models CNN and MNB for t hree  different datasets of 5000 
Bangla  text, 7000 Romani sed Bangla  text and combination of 12000 Bangla and Romanised text , respectively . 
However, CNN mode ls achieved the best performance , using  the separate dataset s; an accuracy of  84% in 
the Romanised Bangla dataset  and 80% was achieved using the combined dataset .  
Ahammed et al.  [17] developed two different models based on SVM and MNB with TF -IDF feature 
extraction techniques, having a lower dataset of 1339 comments . The accuracy achieved in Naïve Bayes was 
72%, w hile SVM obtained an accuracy of 70%.  
 Ghosh et al.  [18] proposed cyberbullying detec tion in Bengali language strategies using various 
machine learning models: support vector machine, logistic regression, random forest and passive 
aggressive classifiers where TF -IDF and bag of words embedding techniques were used. The d ataset was 
labelled with ‘bully’ on the basis of sexual, threat, troll and religious contents or ‘not-bully’. There were 
three  other categories: to whom the comment passed, adjacent gender and n umber  of reactions.  An accuracy 
was 78.1%  have been achieved through this model.  
Ahmed et al.  [19] developed a hybrid neural network model using binary classification and multiclass 
classification, having a dataset of 44,001 Facebook comments, classified bully comments having an accuracy 
of 85%. This model  has some  limitation of false detection in term s of large sentences.   
Tripto et. al  [20] developed deep learning based models to classify Bengali sentences having three class 
sentiment labels such as positive, negative and neutral as well as another five class sentiment labels 
including strongly positive, positive, neutral, negative  and strongly negative. A model , to figure out the six 
different emotions that can be present in a Bengali sentence , i.e., rage, disgust, fear, joy, sadn ess and 
surprise , was created. In their research, a variety of YouTube videos, comments in Bangla, English and 
Romani sed Bangla (Bangla in English) were used. Two different word embedding techniques, i.e., 
Continuous gag of words (CBOW) and skip gram (SG) , have been used to preprocess the data. Both d eep 
learning models , such as  LSTM and CNN , as well as machine learning models , such as  naïve bayes and 
SVM , were used. Their research reveals that the  LSTM models  based on deep learning outperform basic 
machine learning models, with an accuracy of 65.97% and 54.24% for 3 class and 5 class sentiment s, 
respectively. In terms of emotion detection, accuracy  of the LSTM models  was 59.23%.  It was also observed 
that amongst the deep learning , LSTM model which  performed better than CN N. 
Chakraborty et. al  [21] developed multinomial naïve bayes, support vector machine, CNN -LSTM based 
approaches to detect cyberbullying based on Bengali Unicode text and Unicode emoticons, gathering 
dataset from different pages of Facebook. For feature extraction , TF-IDF has been used in MNB and SVM 
classifier. They have also used linear support vector classifier and radial basis function kernal in support 
vector classifier (RBF SVC). Their re sults revealed that a mong st these three models, SVM with linear kernal 
perform ed better than others, demonstrating 78% accuracy.  
Tuhin et al.  [22] separately introduced two models using  naïve bayes and topical approach for 
sentiment analysis of Bengali language and deal t with an emotion -based dataset consisting of happiness, AETiC 2024, Vol. 8, No. 1 53 
www.aetic.theiaer.org  sadness, tenderness, excitement, anger and scaredness. The d ataset was created manually . Their topical 
approach , using TF -IDF feature extraction , performs better achieving a 90% accuracy.  
Sultana et al.  [23] proposed six numerous machine learning models including logistic regression, 
multinomial naïve bayes, random forest, support vector machine, K -nearest neighbo ur and gradient 
boosting. For word embedding , TF-IDF transformer and TF -IDF vectorizer were used. Their  work  obtained 
a better accuracy of 85.7% using  SVM classifier . 
Shah  et al.  [24] conducted a  research work based on various ML  models, such as  SVM, KNN, logistic 
regression and RF , using  a larger dataset of  15307 rows which was taken from  English comments and a 
smaller dataset of 3000 rows which was taken from Hinglish (Hindi in English) comments . Their results  
showed an accuracy of 92% on average.  
As social media  platform s are open to multimodal data such as texts, images, videos, etc. , cyberbullying 
on such platforms are not only limited to through the of  texts, but also through images and videos. In this 
regard, Roy  et al.  [26] developed a CNN based approach with transfer learning model , to detect toxic images . 
They have managed to achi eve an accuracy of 89% using  a comparatively small  dataset of 1339 images.  
 Raj et al.  [27] proposed numerous ML models and neural networks techniques to detect bullying in 
English language. The dataset was collected from Wikipedia . A 5-fold-cross validation technique have  been 
used for training and testing every models. Different word embedding  techniques such as count 
vectori sation, TF -IDF, GloVe and paragram were used with various ML models , i.e., n aïve bayes, XG boost, 
SVM  and logistic regression. Moreover, multiple neural networks , such as  CNN, LSTM, GRU, Bi -LSTM, Bi -
GRU, CNN with BiLSTM and  attention based Bidirectional LSTM were also used with those word 
embedding techniques. According to their findings, for this purpose, the machine learning methods weren't 
as effective the as neural network -based models. Among st the  ML models, SVM with TF -IDF word 
embedding perform ed comparatively better with a 95.02% accuracy . Among st the  neural -network based 
techniques , Bi-GRU with GloVe embedding technique outperform ed and the other models achieving an  
accuracy of 96.98%.  
 Sultan et al.  [28] analy sed performance of deep learning as well as machine learning  based  models  for 
text detection, using  three distinct datasets including Twitter data, offensive language and cyberbullying 
data . Their research showed the ef ficacy of the text detection techniques using deep learning model based , 
such as  CNN, LSTM and Bi-LSTM , are better than that of m achine learning based models , such as, NB, 
KNN, SVM, RF, DT with BoW, TF -IDF and DL Algorithms . In each dataset analysis, the Bi-LSTM based 
model outperformed  others . The accurac ies of all the machine learning models were  below 90%.   
Reghunathan  et al.  [29] developed three different machine learning models to compare the accuracy 
using two different languages , viz.  English and Malayalam (one of the Indian native languages). Using TF-
IDF techniques in feature extraction , they have  obtained accuracies of 90% and 93.75% , using SVM for 
English and Malayalam dataset , respectively . Their results showed that SVM outperform ed other models, 
such as logistic regression and random forest.  
Wu et al. [30] conducted a study on the causes of cyberbullying and proposed a mode l to detect factors 
of cyberbullying . To conduct large data analysis for two instances of cyberbullying, they suggested a model 
based on the BERT classifier. They identified  some of the aspects of cyberbullying and developed a manual 
annotation corpus.  This work  has collected many comments and posts  from social media or forums  and 
distributed in six classes or types of cyberbully ing. 
There are also some other studies using Bi_LSTM model , to detect the cyberbullying.  Bilal et al.  [31] 
have proposed various neural networks -based  techniques to detect cyberbullying in Roman Urdu language. 
They have collected a dataset of 30000 comments from Facebook and Twitter , where half of the comments  
(i.e., 15000)  were hate -speeches and remaining half of the comments were neutral. They have developed  an 
annotation guideline for Roman Urdu hate speech and context -aware based model, employing  CNN, 
LSTM, Bi -LSTM and attention based Bi -LSTM approaches . The attention based Bi -LSTM demonstrated the 
highest accuracy of 87.50 %. However, their plans for future work  include detect ing sentiment of a sentence. 
That being said,  the quality of the annotation of the Roman Urdu hate speech dataset may help increas ing 
the accuracy .  Kumar et al.  [32] proposed a multi-input integrated learning using deep neural networks for 
cyberbullying in real time code -mix data. In their research,  they had used different word embedding 
techniques , such as GloVe for English  and Fast-Text for Hindi. For English data feature extraction, capsule AETiC 2024, Vol. 8, No. 1 54 
www.aetic.theiaer.org  network dynamic routing and for Hinglish data Bi -LSTM ha ve been used. Both t he models achieved an 
accuracy o f 97%.

3.1. Data Collection  
As not much research on cyberbullying detection in Bengali language has  been conducted thus far, 
dataset collection for this research was a very chall enging task. To facilitate this research, an appropriate 
dataset has been produced by combining different datasets from Kaggle, Mendeley and some manually 
added ones. This  has been done to ensure that the dataset used for this research is strong and versat ile 
enough. In this project, as demonstrated in Figure  2, a balanced dataset of total 12282  social media comments 
in Bengali language have  been used.

www.aetic.theiaer.org  3.2. Data Preprocessing  
The dataset was imported from ‘csv’ file and comments with adjacent level of toxic or non -toxic ha ve 
been inserted into two distinct lists. This work has divided the comment section into four categories like 
threat, obscene, insult and racism. However, if the comment belongs to any of the mentioned categories, it 
will be considered  as toxic otherwise as nontoxic. The dataset contained several emojis , as most of  the 
phrases were taken from various internet platforms. Upon collection of the initial entries fo r the dataset, the 
data pre -processing steps have been completed, including emoji reduction, tokenisation, word stemming, 
vocabulary set construction and pad sequencing . 
3.2.1. Emoji or Data Cleaning  
Before passing through the model, for training and testi ng purposes, the dataset was cleaned by 
removing the emojis  as it could have a negative impact on the model’s performance.  
3.2.2. Tokeni sation  
The technique of breaking down a text into smaller word chunks is known as tokenisation. In this 
research, the co mments from the dataset were split into words.  
3.2.3. Stemming or Lemmati sation  
The process in which the root of a word can be obtained is known as stemming or lemmatisation. For 
example: ‘mature’ is the root word of ‘immature’. Therefore, in this step, th e suffix and the prefix of a word 
has been eliminated for finding its root. This would also help detecting similar words, i.e., originated from 
the same root, in the future.  
3.2.4. Vocabulary Set Formation  
This step has been carried out to reduce redundancy of the words and to produce a unique set of words.  
3.2.5. Sequencing  
By using the indices of corresponding words from vocabulary set, the sentences have been 
reconstructed. For this purpose, the comments or sentences have been replaced with vect ors of integers. To 
reduce complexity arising from the varied length of data, the sentences have been converted to a fixed 
length of 80, using pad sequence of 0 to the left of the vectors. This is because, in most of the cases, the toxic 
words are located either in  the middle of the sentences or at end of the smaller sentences. However, 
completion of sequencing with padding thus turns the input vector shape into 12282 ×80. Upon successful 
accomplishment of the aforementioned steps (i.e., 3.2.1 – 3.2.5 ), the data pre -processing is completed,  and 
the vector of  the dataset becomes ready to be passed through the model for the  training and testing 
purposes.  
3.3. Data Split  
The dataset was divided into two distinct portions with a ratio of 80 to 20. The ratio indicates while 
80% of the dataset were utilised to train the model, the remaining 20% of the dataset were used to evaluate 
the model’s performance.  
3.4. Model Architecture  
Figure 3 shows the basic architecture of proposed model  which  consists  of an embedd ing layer, two 
Bidirectional LSTM layers and two dense layers . To simplify the things and get better features , this work 
applied pre -padding with a maximum length of 80 and a value of 0, which resulted in the reduction of 
longer sentences with lengths or w ord counts above 80.  In this model , an embedding layer  is particularly 
a hidden layer that converts input data or information from a high -dimensional space to a low  dimensional 
space, enabling the network to better understand how inputs relate to one anot her and process the data 
more promptly.  The input dataset has been passed through the embedding layer and configured to turn 
every word into a vector with a size of 200 , because it was used to demonstrate how similar words were, 
and the outcome was (9825 × 80) to (9825 × 80 × 200). The output of the embedding layers  has been 
considered as an input of the Bi -LSTM layer. In this model , two Bi -LSTM layers  (i.e., 64 neurons and 32 
neurons)  have been employed. Dense layer s are generally  employed to alter the dimensionality of the AETiC 2024, Vol. 8, No. 1 57 
www.aetic.theiaer.org  output s from the Bi-LSTM  layer s. In this model , two dense layers have been  added following the Bi-LSTM 
layers. The first dense layer of 64 neurons has been used to inactive the neurons of the previous layer to 
reduce the  complexity. For that purpose,  ReLU  activation function has been used. The second dense layer 
of single neuron has been used to convert the output between (0, 1) , because of  binary classification problem. 
In this regard, the last dense layer has been employed with the Sigmoid activation fun ction.  The experiment 
was executed on 100 epochs and 1024 batch size.  
3.5. Hyperparameter Tuning for Optimi sation  
The parameters that are controlled by the user , to regulate the model during the training or the learning 
stage , are referred as hyperparamete rs of machine learning.  
3.5.1. Learning Rate  
The rate at which the model will progress through the learning stage has a profound impact by the 
learning rate. Furthermore, the user can alter the rate of learning based on error during the learning phase , 
in order to lessen it. The higher rate can directly affect the learning procedure to f ind an optim um value and  
it is quite challenging . However, it generates error and the system becomes  unstable. Moreover, lower rate 
can reduce the speed of learning and  it can be time consum ing too . 
Figure 3.  Basic Architecture of the Proposed Model  
3.5.2. Batch Size and Epoch  
The training set separated into different subsets , which  influence how rapidly a model learns and 
generali ses by updating the model parameters , is referred as the batch size. Additionally, the parameter 
epoch shows how many times the model has been trained on the training data. Until the reduction in 
validation error, epochs can be increased. The epoch indicates when to stop learning  if no improvement is 
obtained  in validation error.  
3.5.3. Activation Function  
By mapping the weighted sum and bias, the activation function regulates the output and lowers the 
complexity of the neurons. By deactivating neurons that have little impact on outp ut, it establishes 
nonlinearity. Despite having numerous activation functions , two distinct functions were used in this 
research work.   
3.5.4. Optimi ser 
Algorithms that are used to minimi se error and raise  efficiency by controlling learning rate and weight s 
are referred as the optimiser . By performing successive modifications to the parameters of each of the layers 
that are connected, the model performance is optimi sed.  
3.6. Performance Evaluation and Mathematical Equation  
The performance of the model can  be obtained by calculating  True Positive (TP), True Negatives (TN), 
False Positives (FP), and False Positives Negatives (FN). From those values , confusion matrices were also 
AETiC 2024, Vol. 8, No. 1 58 
www.aetic.theiaer.org  plotted. The developed classifier's performance is measured using a variety of performance indicators. In 
text categori sation, several typical performance metrics are examined in relation to the following metrics : 
3.6.1. Accuracy  
The accuracy of a model represents t he number of correctly classified or predicted comments (n umber 
of true positives and number of true negatives) . It can be defined as:   
Accuracy =  TP+TN
TP+TN+FP+FN                                                                                                                       (1) 
3.6.2. Precision  
Precision score emphasi ses the precision of the model's successful predictions. Out of all positive 
occurrences that were predicted, it determines the proportion of correctly projected positive outcomes , as 
follows:  
Precision = TP
TP+FP                                                                                                                               (2) 
3.6.3. Recall  
Quantifying recall is an estimate of all positive occurrences that were accurately forecast.  The higher 
the recall is, the more efficacy of predicting positive events is.  Recall  can be defined as:  
Recall = TP
TP+FN                                                                                                                                         (3) 
3.6.4. F-score  
To provide an authoritative evaluation of the model's accuracy, F -score merges the precision score w ith 
the recall score into a single rating , as follows:  
F−measure =  2×Precision ×Recall
Precision +Recall                                                                                                        (4) 
4. Experiment and Result  
To optimise the loss in this model, the Adam optimiser has been selected as default. This study 
analy sed the model’s performance by changing various model parameters such as  batch size, epochs, initial 
learning rate, etc. Learning rate scheduler was used with this optimi ser to lessen overfitting issue that have  
been found with SGD optimiser. By lowering the learning rate in accordance with a predetermined 
schedule, it can modify the learning rate during training. The model trained with an initial learning rate of 
0.1 and the learning rate scheduler’s constant decay rate was obtained by calculating the quotient of learning 
rate divided by the number of epochs. So, by altering different values from 0.5 to 0.9 of the momentum, the 
performance of the model was examined. SGD wit h momentum 0.9 and epoch at 50 could slightly solve the 
overfitting issue of using SGD optimiser. The model achieved a 99% training accuracy with 94.71% 
validation accuracy. The accuracy and F1 score of the model were  94.46% and 94.64% , respectively. Figur e 
4(a) and Figure 4(b) describe the resultant loss and accuracy curve per epoch during model compilation and 
Figure 5 illustrates the adjacent confusion matrix. Adam optimiser was employed to analy se the 
performance by changing model parameters such  batch size, epochs and initial learning rate. From the 
analysis, better results were obtained with the initial learning rate of 0.00001 , using 100 epochs . The loss and 
accuracy for training and validation data curves are plotted in Figure 6(a) and Figure 6(b) , respectively . The 
outcome of the model’s confusion matrix is also demonstrated  in Figure 7. Both the training and validation 
accuracy levels were 99% and 95%, respectively.  This model had a 95.23% F1 score and a testing accuracy 
of 95.08%.

9(b); Figure 10(a)  and Figure 10(b); Figure 11(a), Figure 11(b) , Figure 12(a)  and Figure 12(b) , respectively. It 
is observed from  the curves that by the repeat ed training and scoring the model on various segments of the 
dataset, k-fold cross -validation delivers a more accurate estimation of the model's efficacy than a single 
train -test split. It provides an evaluation metric that is more trustworthy and lessens the effect of data 
variability. A 5-fold cross validation was accomplished in order to verify the model's effectiveness . Adam 
optimiser is used, with epochs fixed at 100 per fold, for reducing the loss. By tuning hyper parameters  
several times, the best result was obtained in the 5-fold cross validation with a learning rate of 0.00001 . The 
resultant average accuracy of thi s method was 94.31%. Figure  13(a), Figure 13(b), Figure 13(c), Figure 13(d)

The proposed model outperforms previous existing models with accuracy over 94% and overcomes 
some of the limitations , including lack of using higher dataset and low accuracy. Table 3 shows the 
comparison of the proposed model with other existing different deep learning models  for cyberbullying 
detection  in Bangla . It is noticed that the better accuracy of 95.08% was found from using Adam optimi ser.

5. Limitation  
This research work has concentrated on deep learning to determine whether a statement is toxic or 
nontoxic  for Bangla language. The most challenging part of this research was to collect a dataset having 
adequate  varieties as well as balanc ing and optimi sing the two layers Bi -LSTM model. To fit the model ’s 
SGD with momentum, Adam optimi sers were separately used. Moreover, a 5-fold cross validation with 
Adam optimi ser was used to analy se the model ’s performances. In all the cases, accuracy was above 90%. 
However,  some noisy and anomalous sentences , such as ‘ততোরমতন  ফোজিলের  সোলে  কেোবেোই  উচিৎনো’, 
‘অপদোে থ লকোেোকোর ’ might have  reduce d the performance of the model. As in the first sentence the word 
‘ততোরমতন ’, ‘কেোবেোই ’, ‘উচিৎনো’ are not single word s, rather these are combination of two different words 
i.e., ‘ততোর’ and মতন’, ‘কেো’ and ‘বেোই’, as well as ‘উচিৎ’ and ‘নো’. Similarly, i n the second sentence , 
‘অপদোে থ লকোেোকোর ’ is not a single word, it is rather a sentence comprising  two different words , i.e.,  ‘অপদোে থ ’ 
and ‘তকোেোকোর ’. Therefore , in such  cases, the model couldn’t learn the real meaning of sentences, resulting 
in a lower  performance. On the contrary , in some cases , due to lack of variations in sentence structures , the 
model might  have gain ed overfitting .  
6. Conclusion  and Future Work  
As the prime goal of this project is to detect cyberbullying based on  binary classification, the model 
was designed with different op timisers and to generalise the model’s  performance, a 5-fold cross validation 
was applied. The accuracy of the model with Adam optimiser is 9 5.08%, however, an overfitting issue was 
observed. To address overfitting problems, the learning rate scheduler is applied. Using the momentum -
based SGD optimiser , the overfitting problem was minimised and an accuracy of 94. 46% was achieved. 
Using a 5-fold cross validation, the accuracy was 9 4.31%. Therefore, it is anticipated that the model 
perform ed well on different  variation s of the datasets. Future research directions include further improving 
the model for multiclass classification as well as to address the limitations . Furthermore, deployment of the 
ensemble model, using numerous deep learning algorithms, to enrich the model’s accuracy can also be 
considered. Attention -based model can also be deployed and evaluated for this purpose. TF -IDF and 
word2vec models, in word embedding techniques instead of default word embedding layer, could also be 
utilised to slightly raise the accuracy .   AETiC 2024, Vol. 8, No. 1 63
