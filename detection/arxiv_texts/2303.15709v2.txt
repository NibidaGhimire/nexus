Abstract: Type II seesaw leptogenesis simultaneously explains the origin of neutrino
masses, the baryon asymmetry of our universe, and the inflation. The Large Hadron Col-
lider(LHC) provides an opportunity to directly test type II seesaw leptogenesis by looking
for the predicted triplet Higgs. In this paper, we perform an analysis of the detection
prospect for the triplet Higgs at the LHC through the multi-electron channels. We find
that due to the contribution of pp→H±±H∓process, the sensitivity of multi-electron
channels searching for the doubly-charged Higgs pair production can be improved. We also
investigate the 3e+Emiss
Tsignals to probe the pp→H±±H∓production and find that the
future high luminosity LHC could probe a triplet Higgs around 1.2 TeV at 2σlevel.

1 Introduction
One of the unresolved issues in modern physics is the origin of the neutrino mass. In the
standard model(SM) neutrinos are massless, but the observation of the neutrino oscillation
indicates that neutrinos have tiny masses, which requires the extension of the SM. The most
popularideasforgeneratingneutrinomassesaretheso-calledseesawmechanisms,whichcan
beclassifiedintothreetypes. ThetypeI/IIIseesawintroducesadditionalthree(atleasttwo)
singlet/triplet fermions [1–5], while the type II seesaw only includes an additional triplet
scalar which provides a minimal framework to explain the origin of neutrino masses [6–11].
In the model of type II seesaw, the triplet Higgs can directly couple to the lepton sectors,
and if the neutral component of the triplet Higgs gets a vev, the Majorana mass of the
neutrinos can be generated.
Interestingly, the type II seesaw could also provide a feasible leptogenesis if it also
plays the role of the inflaton, as pointed out by a recent study [12, 13]. Therefore, this
simple model could explain three important problems at the same time: the origin of
the neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of our universe, and inflation. Comparing
with the leptogenesis from type-I seesaw which generally requires a high scale right-handed
neutrino [14], the type II seesaw leptogenesis allows the triplet Higgs to be as light as TeV
scale which could be directly probed by the Large Hadron Collider(LHC). Indeed LHC
already performs some surveys and currently sets a limit of around a few hundred GeV for
the doubly charged Higgs contained in the triplet Higgs depending on its decay products
[15–19]. The decay of the doubly charged Higgs is sensitive to the vacuum expectation
value of the triplet Higgs. For a large vev v∆≳0.1MeV, it mainly decays into two gauge
bosons, otherwise, it would decay into dileptons [20]. However, if the baryon asymmetry is
– 1 –generated by the type II seesaw, to avoid the lepton number to be washed out, the vev of
the triplet Higgs v∆<1keV is preferred. Therefore, looking for the triplet Higgs through
the leptonic channel would provide a visible way to test the type II seesaw leptogenesis.
In this paper, we investigate the detection capability of the triplet Higgs in future large
hadron colliders. Previous studies on this aspect have been investigated in numerous works
including, for example, Refs. [21–32]. The test of the type II seesaw leptogenesis from
lepton flavor violation can be also found in [33].
In the model of the standard model with additional triplet Higgs, after electroweak
symmetry breaking, besides the SM-like Higgs there are 6 additional scalars present in
the spectrum which can be denoted as A0,H0,H±,H±±where A0,H0are the extra
CP-odd/even neutral scalars, H±, H±±are the charged Higgs and doubly-charged Higgs
respectively. The charged Higgs or the doubly-charged Higgs can be pair-produced through
the Drell-Yan process, providing good channels to probe the triplet Higgs at the colliders.
The ATLAS group already performs a search for the doubly-charged Higgs assuming it
mostlydecayingintodileptons, andthemassofthedoubly-chargedHiggs H±±uptoaround
800 GeV has been excluded [15, 17]1. Depending on the number of observed leptons, the
detection strategy is classified mainly into three categories: the four-lepton channel, three-
lepton channel, and two-lepton channel. Each channel has different sensitivity and the final
result is derived from the combination of these three channels. On the other hand, since the
triplet Higgs is a triplet under the SM SU(2)Lgroup, the charged Higgs can be produced
together with the doubly-charged Higgs. This production rate can be even higher than
theH±±pair production[35]. Noticing that the charged Higgs decays into a lepton and a
neutrino, the H±±H∓production will also contribute to the ATLAS search channels and
a better sensitivity could be derived. We will demonstrate this point later.
In addition, since the charged Higgs would decay into a charged lepton and a neutrino,
a large missing energy would be present for the H±±H∓pair production. It would be
intriguing to search for the H±±H∓pair production via the signal of 3e+Emiss
T, which
may provide a good sensitivity to the triplet Higgs. This paper is organized as follows: in
Sec. 2 we give a brief introduction of the type II seesaw model and the mechanism of Type
II seesaw leptogenesis. In Sec. 3 we calculate the production of the H±andH±±at the
LHC. We analysis the sensitivity of the triplet Higgs at LHC including the contribution of
H±±H∓pair production, then we show the prospect for the H±±H∓searches requiring a
large missing energy for the final states in Sec. 5. We draw our conclusion in Sec. 6.

The scalar sector of type II seesaw model contains the SM Higgs doublet Φand a
SU(2)Ltriplet scalar field ∆with hypercharge Y=1 which can be written as

L ⊃(DµΦ)†DµΦ +Tr(Dµ∆)†Dµ∆−V(Φ,∆). (2.2)
Besides SM Yukawa interaction, one can include an additional Yukawa interaction term
between the triplet Higgs and leptons,
Lν=−yνLTCiσ 2∆L+h.c., (2.3)
where the yνis the Yukawa coupling, Lis the left-handed lepton doublet and Cis the charge
conjugation operator. After the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), the

where v∆is the vacuum expectation value of the neutral part of triplet Higgs. Then the
neutrino mass can be generated by
mν=√

Here mνis a complex symmetric 3×3matrix and the physical neutrino masses can be
derived by diagonalizing mνwith PMNS matrix U. The gauge invariant potential for the
scalar sector can be written as follows:

One can define the mass-splitting parameter ∆m=mH±±−mH±which describes the
typical mass difference of the spectra for the triplet Higgs sector. The decay behavior of
the triplet Higgs is different from different parameter spaces[20, 30, 31, 36].For ∆m < O (10)
GeV and v∆<10−4GeV, the H±±/H±decays into l±±/l±ν. For ∆m < O (10)GeV and
v∆>10−4GeV, H±±/H±decays into W±±/W±ZorW±h0. If∆m > O (10)GeV, the
cascade decay channels would become significant. In the case of triplet Higgs leptogenesis,
we have ∆m < O (5)GeV and v∆<10keV [37], thus the H±±/H±would mainly decay
into dileptons, giving a typical multi-lepton signature at LHC. In the following we briefly
discuss how to achieve leptogenesis.
2.1 Leptogenesis through type II seesaw
It is known that the minimal type II seesaw model can not successfully lead to thermal
leptogenesis, thus the Affleck-Dine mechanism is considered. In the Affleck-Dine mecha-
nism, the scalar field acquires a large vev along the flat direction during the inflationary
epoch. In the subsequent evolution, if the scalar field carries a nonzero baryon or lepton
number, the baryon or lepton number violating interactions will induce a rotating trajec-
tory for the vev, which can generate baryon or lepton asymmetry and transfer to ordinary
particles at the end of inflation. Fortunately, the Affleck-Dine mechanism can be achieved
in the minimal type II seesaw model.
Considering the non-minimal couplings of ∆andΦto gravity, the relevant Lagrangian
in Jordan frame can be written as
L√−g⊃ −1
2M2
PR−f(Φ,∆)R+gµν(DµΦ)†(DνΦ)+gµνTr(Dµ∆)†(Dν∆)−V(Φ,∆)(2.14)
where Ris Ricci scalar. To simplify the analysis, we focus on the neutral components ϕ0
andδ0and consider the non-minimal coupling to be
f(Φ,∆) = ξΦ|ϕ0|2+ξ∆|δ0|2(2.15)
Through a Weyl transformation, the Lagrangian can be written in Einstein frame, in which
the gravitational portion is of Einstein-Hilbert form. It can be shown that the scalar
potential in Einstein frame is
VE(Φ,∆) =M4
P 
M2
P+ 2f(Φ,∆)2V(Φ,∆) (2.16)
– 4 –which exhibits a flat direction at the large field limit of ϕ0andδ0. This flat direction can
be recognized as a Starobinsky-like inflationary trajectory, and the inflaton is the mixing
ofδ0andϕ0.
Since the triplet ∆carry lepton number l∆=−2and the µterm induces lepton
number violating interaction, all the ingredients of Affleck-Dine mechanism are included.
During the inflationary evolution, the non-trivial motion of the angular direction of δ0can
generate lepton number asymmetry, which transfer to ordinary particles during reheating.
After reheating, a part of net lepton number is converted to baryon number through the
sphaleron process.
However, if any lepton number violating processes are in thermal equilibrium after re-
heating, the generated lepton asymmetry will be washed out. We require that the processes
LL↔HHandHH↔∆are never in thermal equilibrium,

In Fig. 2 we show the the cross section of H±±H∓∓, H±H∓, H±±H∓pair production

and we assume H±±,H±share a same mass parameter. Doubly-charged triplet Higgs
has a considerable cross section and a distinctive decay signature, the same-charge lepton
final state. Note that the H±±H∓has an even larger cross section than the H±±H∓∓
production, thus it may provide a better sensitivity of the triplet Higgs search.

The decay modes of triplet Higgs with different v∆−∆mparameters have been thor-
oughly discussed in Refs.[30, 31, 36 ?]. We consider ∆m < O (1)GeV and v∆<10−6GeV,
thus the doubly-charged Higgs H±±and singly-charged scalars mostly decay to leptonic
final states. The decay branching ratio are given by,

It has been found that for normal hierarchy(NH) and inverted hierarchy(IH)[20],
NH:BR(H++→µµ), BR(H++→ττ)≫BR(H++→ee)
IH:BR(H++→ee)≫BR(H++→µµ), BR(H++→ττ)
In the following study, we assume the BR(H++→ee) = 100% to present our result.
4 Multielectron searches at the LHC
The ATLAS collaboration has released a multilepton final states search with an inte-
grated luminosity of 36.1 fb−1of pp collisions at√s=13 TeV [17]. This analysis focuses on
the decays H±±→e±e±, H±±→e±µ±orH±±→µ±µ±with a branching ratio around
100%. The events are divided into three signal regions. We refer to their selection criteria
and exhibit in Tab. 1. The final state events with 2,3electrons is also considered due to
the missing of the electrons in the detector. In our paper, we first simulated the experi-
mental process by adding the contribution of H±±H∓to the signal event since it will also
contribute the 2,3electron signal region. In our simulation, we implement the triplet Higgs
model in FeynRules [39], and import UFO files [40] into MadGraph [41] to generate signal
events. We use the NNPDF23LO1 [42] for parton distribution function and the parton
showering and hadronisation are simulated with PYTHIA8 [43]. We perform the detector
simulations with Delphes [44] and data analysis with ROOT [45].
For the two-electrons and three-electrons signal regions(SR2E and SR3E), at least one
pair of electrons with the same charge is required. The separation of the same-charge
electrons and the scalar sum of the electrons’ transverse momenta are required to be
∆R(e±e±)>3.5andP|PT(e)|>300GeV, respectively. The vector sum of the elec-
trons’ transverse momenta is required to be PT(e±e±)>100GeV. The selection criteria
for electron are |η|<2.47andPT>30GeV. Besides the pre-selection cut described above,
for the signal region SR3E and SR4E, events are rejected if any opposite-charge same-
flavour electron pair is within 10 GeV of the Zboson mass to reduce the background from
Zproduction. In the four-electron signal region(SR4E), there must be two electron pairs
with the same charge and the total charge is zero. The ∆M/¯Mrequirement is applied to
exclude background where the two same-charge pairs have incompatible invariant masses

. In the ALTAS experiment, for different ¯M, the
value of ∆Mis different. And we simply take ∆M/¯M < 0.1in the four electron channel
– 7 –. In all signal regions, the invariant mass of same-charge electron pairs are required to
be above 200 GeV. In order to restrain background events arising from top-quark decays,
events with b-tagged jet are vetoed.

To validate our simulation, we first simulate the signal events from pp→H±±H∓∓
productionandgetthesignalcutefficiency. Usingtheobservedsignaleventfromthearticle,
we apply the CLsmethod [46] to get the 95 %CL upper limits on the pp→H±±H∓∓
cross section. The result is shown in Fig. 3 denoted as the black dashed curve [17]. As a
comparison, the limit from ATLAS experiments are also shown as the black dotted line. It
shows our limit is close to the one derived from the ATLAS experiment.
Since pp→H±±H∓contributes the SR2E and SR3E signal region, we expect the real
limit should be stronger. Therefore, we simulate the process pp→H±±H∓→l±l±l∓ν±
and get the corresponding signal efficiency. To combine our result, we denote the σ1,2and
ε1,2as cross-section and cut efficiency for pp→H±±H∓∓process and pp→H±±H∓
process respectively, then the total signal events n=Lσ1ε1+Lσ2ε2for each signal region.
We set the limit on the total signal events. To show our result, we can use an effective cut
efficiency of ε2eff=ε2+σ1/σ2ε1forpp→H±±H∓process and set the limit on the cross
section of pp→H±±H∓production, which is shown as the red dashed curve in Fig. 3.
It shows the combined limit is around 100 GeV stronger than the one derived only from
pp→H±±H∓∓process.

Tsignal
Notice that pp→H±±H∓has a relatively larger cross section and the final states
include a missing energy. It is intriguing to examine whether the 3e+Emiss
Tcould provide
a better sensitivity to the triplet Higgs.

t¯t,t¯tW,t¯tZ,t¯th, tribosonandDrell-Yanprocesses. However, asshownintheATLASpaper,
for the 3lprocess, the diboson background is much more dominant than other backgrounds.
Therefore for the background simulation, we only consider the events from the diboson
process. The background and the signal are both simulated by using MadGraph with an
MLM matching. For the cross section of the diboson, we also add the K-factor to include
the NLO correction. The LO cross-section for the diboson process and the corresponding
K-factor at√s=13 TeV LHC [47] are shown in Tab. 2.

To ensure simulation credibility and validate the charge misidentification effect in the
electron channel, the same-charge region(SCR) is also considered, which only exert b-jet
veto. For pp→H±±H∓→l±l±l∓ν±, large missing transverse energy will appear in
the final states. We show the missing energy distribution of diboson process and pp→
H±±H∓→l±l±l∓ν±process in figure 4. It shows that a cut on the missing energy around
few hundred GeV would remove much of the background.
The distinction of the missing energy distribution between signal and diboson back-
ground motivates us to add a missing energy cut Emiss
T>300GeV. The cut flow for the
background and signal for a luminosity 3000fb−1at 13 TeV LHC are shown in Tab. 3. It
clearly shows that only 10% of the background are left after imposing the cut Emiss
T>300
GeV, while most of the signal events are still kept. Using expected discovery significance
S/√
B, the results are shown in Fig 5 at 13 TeV LHC with a luminosity 3000fb−1. We find
the triplet mass less than 1.2 TeV can be reached at 2σfor the high luminosity LHC in
future. As a comparision, we also show the 2σsensitivity for the multi-electron searches
channels mentioned in last section where the missing energy cut is not imposed. We find
that at when the triplet Higgs mass is below 800 GeV, the multi-electron channel still pro-

vide a better sensitivity for the triplet Higgs. However, the 3e+Emiss
Tsignal could reach
a higher triplet Higgs mass when the triplet Higgs mass is larger than 800 GeV. The main
reason for this is that when the mass of the triplet Higgs is low, the missing energy could
be lower and the missing energy cut would also hurt the signal. We believe that an even
larger missing energy cut could further suppress the background and a better sensitivity
for the heavy triplet Higgs can be reached.

6 Conclusion
The type II seesaw leptogenesis simultaneously explains the origin of neutrino masses,
the baryon asymmetry of our universe, and the inflation. The large hadron collider(LHC)

the triplet Higgs at the LHC through the multi-electron channels. We find that due to the
contribution of pp→H±±H∓process, the sensitivity of multi-electron channels searching
for the doubly-charged Higgs pair production can be improved. We also investigate the
3e+Emiss
Tsignals to probe the pp→H±±H∓production and we find this channel may
provide a better sensitivity than the multi-electron channel. Our result shows that the
future LHC could probe a triplet Higgs around 1.2 TeV at 2 σlevel with a luminosity 3000
fb−1for the 3e+Emiss
Tsearch channel.

A The CLsmethod
Indistinguishable from background hypotheses in the case of few signal events, we use
theCLsmethod to improve experimental sensitivity. The usual confidence level for signal
and background hypothesis is given by the probability that the test-statistic Qis less than
or equal to the value observed in the experiment:
CLs+b=Ps+b(Q≤Qobs) =ZQobs
−∞dPs+b
dQdQ, (A.1)
– 11 –wheredPs+b
dQis the probability distribution function for signal and background experiments.
Likewise, the confidence level in the background-only hypothesis is:
CLb=Pb(Q≤Qobs) =ZQobs
−∞dPb
dQdQ, (A.2)
anddPb
dQis the probability distribution function for background-only experiments.
To obtain the limit, we use the definition of CLs
CLs=CLs+b
CLb, (A.3)
The signal hypotheses is excluded at the confidence level CLwhen
1−CLs≤CL. (A.4)
To combine the results of the signals from several channels, the test statistic is defined as
the likelihood ratio
Q=nY
i=1qi (A.5)
with
qi=e−(si+bi)((si+bi)Ni
N!
e−bibNi
i
N!(A.6)
for counting experiments. The estimated signal and background are siandbi, and ilabeled
the channel. Then Nis the number of observed candidates. The final likelihood function
should also include the uncertainty of the backgrounds. All of the above calculation can be
preformed numerically by Monte Carlo method.
