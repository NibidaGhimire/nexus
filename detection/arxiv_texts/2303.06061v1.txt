Abstract
We brieﬂy review and update our earlier published model for dark
matter consisting of nanometer size bubbles of a new speculated va c-
uum phase in which some ordinary material, e.g. carbon, is present
under high pressure caused by the surface tension of the domain w all
surrounding the bubble. These bubbles or pearls are surrounded b y
dust grains, and it is one of the new points of the present article tha t
this dust grain rather than being a three-dimensional blob of ordi-
nary matter is a lower dimensional object of some lower Hausdorﬀ
dimension. We make several order of magnitude ﬁts and ﬁnd rather
good agreement for our model. However we must imagine that the
very high - 3.5 kev - homolumo gap assumed present in the highly
compressed medium inside the bubble has inﬂuenced the neighbour-
ing dust, so as to make it signiﬁcantly harder than usual dust. This
is to ensure that we obtain the correct order of magnitude for the
velocity in the collisions between dark matter particles at which the
cross section falls strongly with increasing velocity.
The dark matter pearls lose their surrounding dust in passing
through the earth’s atmosphere and impacting the earth. They mu st
reach down with their terminal velocity through the shielding to the
DAMA observatory in less than a year, so that there is no problem
in obtaining the seasonal variation eﬀect the DAMA experiment has
observed. This is easier to achieve with a suﬃciently high pearl mass
and this mass is not so strongly restricted once the dust grain is lowe r
dimensional.
Keywords: dark matter, vacuum phases, interstellar dust, X -ray, DAMA-

1 Introduction
What dark matter really consists of is one of greatest myster ies in physics
today, and we have long worked on the proposal that it consist s of bubbles
of a new phase of the vacuum into which is ﬁlled some ordinary m aterial,
such as probably carbon in the form of highly compressed diam ond [1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Our main assumption not based simpl y on the
StandardModel isthat thereareseveral possiblephasesof t hevacuumwith
the same energy density [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. So it is only the surface
tensionSof the surface between the “new” vacuum inside the bubble and
the usual vacuum outside the bubbles which keeps the diamond under high
pressure. Apart from our new speculation of there existing s everal phases
of the vacuum, a speculation with the help of which we predicted the mass
of the Higgs boson [16] before it was found, our model is based only on the
Standard Model, an achievement not usually managed by model s for the
dark matter.
At the present, in spite of the gravitational force from the d ark mat-
ter ﬁtting the motions of the stars and galaxies and cosmolog y well, the
remarkable facts are that
•The majority of the underground experiments - in particular the
Xenon ones [18, 19, 20] - do notsee any dark matter hitting the
Earth, and
•Accelerators - LHC is the most hopeful - have notbeen able to see
any dark matter either.
2 Pearl
The dark matter particles or pearls are composed of:
•A nm-size bubble of a new speculated vacuum ﬁlled with highly com-
pressed atomic stuﬀ, say carbon.
•A surrounding dust particle of “metallicity” material [21, 22] such as
C, O, Si, Fe, ..., presumably of some non-integer Hausdorﬀ di men-
sion about 2 or 1. This atomic matter is inﬂuenced by the elect rons
being partly in a superposition of being inside the bubble of the new
vacuum, where there is very high homolumo gap between ﬁlled a nd
2unﬁlled electron states [11]. This inﬂuences the dust grain material
so as to make it denser and harder.
Pearls interact with:
•other dark matter particles and thereby provide an example o f self-
interacting dark matter (SIDM) [23].
•atomic matter.
The most important evidence for our model may be that we ﬁnd th e
energy value of 3.5 keV in threediﬀerent places as a possible favourite
energy level diﬀerence for dark matter:
•From places in outer space with a lot of dark matter, galaxy cl usters,
Andromeda and the Milky Way Center, as the energy of an unex-
pected X-ray line [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], and strangely also from
Tycho supernova remnant [30].
•As the average energy of the DAMA dark matter events [31, 32].
•As an average energy for the electron recoil excess1in the XENON1T
experiment [33].
Dust easily gets of lower than 3 dimensions because the growi ng of a dust
grain takes place by molecules (monomers) almost one by one b eing at-
tached to the grain as it is at the time and by grains colliding and sticking
together. Such growing could easily make the dimension non- integer. This
idea of a dust grain with a fractal dimension has been studied in [35] and
results from this paper are given in Figure 1.
An example of such a fractal cosmic dust grain built up from 10 24
monomers [36] is given in Figure 2.
It is indeed very likely that such a dust grain would collect o n top of
one of our pearls, which in itself is very much like a seed atom . We may
illustrate that in Figure 3 by drawing our little pearl as a bu bble of new
vacuum inside the dust grain.
If typically the grain size is 0 .1µmand the bubble size is 1 nm=
0.001µm, then the bubble is about 100 times smaller than the dust grai n.
1The results from the more sensitive XENONnT detector were pu blished [34] shortly
after this School. XENONnT reduces the low energy electron r ecoil background to a
factor of 5 lower than in XENON1T and observe no electron exce ss above background.

3 Achievements
Important achievements of our model:
•Explain that only DAMA “sees” the dark matter by the particle s in-
teracting so strongly as to bequite slow and unableto knock n uclei so
as to make observable signals. Instead the DAMA signal is exp lained
as due to emission of electrons from pearls in an excited stat e with
the “remarkable 3.5 keV energy”.
Actually Xenon1T may have seen these electrons from the dark mat-
ter particle decaysas the mysterious electron recoil excess.
•The favourite frequency of electron or photon emission of th e dark
matter particles is due to a homolumo gap in the material insi de the
bubble of the new vacuum. This gap should be equal to the 3.5 ke V.
•Wehavemadearathercomplicated calculation ofwhathappen swhen
the bubbles - making up the main part of the dark matter partic le
- hit each other and the surface/skin/domain wall contract a nd how
onegets out apartof theenergy as3.5keV X-rays [7]. We ﬁtwit hone
parameter both the very frequency 3.5 keV, and the over all in tensity
of the corresponding X-ray line observed from galaxy cluste rs etc.
This production mechanism gives an intensity proportional to the
dark matter density squared and we use the results of the anal ysis of
Cline and Frey [37] whose model shares this property.
•We explain why - otherwise mysteriously - the 3.5 keV line was seen
by Jeltema and Profumo [30] from the Tycho supernova remnant and
probably also problems with the Perseus galaxy cluster 3.5 k eV X-ray

observations. This is by claiming the excitation of the bubb les come
from cosmic radiation in the supernova remnant.
•According to expectations from ideal dark matter that only i nteracts
essentially by gravity there should be e.g in a dwarf galaxy a concen-
trated peak or cusp of dark matter, but that seems not to be tru e.
The inner density proﬁle rather seems to be ﬂat as expected fo r self-
interacting dark matter [23]. Correa [38] can ﬁt the dwarf ga laxy star
velocities by the hypothesis that dark matter particles int eract with
each other with a cross section over mass ratio increasing fo r lower
velocity, as shown in Figure 4. We ﬁt the cross section over ma ss
velocity dependence of hers. But we need a “hardening ” of the dust
around the bubbles.
4 Impact
We imagine that the dark matter pearls lose their dust grain i n the atmo-
sphere or at least, if not before, by the penetration into the earth shielding,
and that they at the same time get excited by means of the energ y from the
braking of the pearls. For a very small number of the pearls th is excitation

energy gets radiated ﬁrst much later when the pearl has passe d through
the earth shielding to the underground detectors, so as to de liver X-ray ra-
diation with just the characteristic 3.5 keV energy per phot on. The energy
is delivered we guess by electrons or photons. Thus experime nts like the
xenon experiments do not “see” it when looking for nucleus-c aused events.
Only DAMA, which does not notice if it is from nuclei or from el ectrons,
does not throw electron-caused events away as something els e.
The dark matter pearls come in with high speed (galactic velo city),
but get stopped down to much lower speed by interaction with t he shield-
ing mountains, whereby they also get excited to emit 3.5 keV X -rays or
electrons .
5 Calculations
The percentages of the matter in the Universe are as follows:
•27%darkmatter(while68%ofaformofenergyknownasdarkene rgy,
and 5 % ordinary matter).
The elements heavier than hydrogen and helium make up of orde r 1% of
ordinary matter and are known as “metals”. Thecomoving dens ity of these
“metals” together is [21]
“metal density” = 5 .48∗106M⊙Mpc−3(1)
= 3.71∗10−31kg/m3. (2)
5.1 Inverse Darknessσ
M
We think that the less the cross section is compared to the mas s the less
is the interaction - with whatever we may consider - and thus t he less the
7“visibility”. It is the lack of visibility which we call dark ness just as we
call dark matter dark matter because we do not “see” it. So a sm aller
cross section means darker and thus the ratio with the cross s ection in the
numerator could be called the inverse darkness.
Using the atomic radii we can calculate the cross sections fo r the fol-
lowing atoms:
Hydrogen H: rH= 25pm⇒σH=πr2
H= 1963pm2(3)
Helium He: rHe= 30pm⇒σHe=π∗r2
He= 2827pm2(4)
Carbon C: rC= 70pm⇒σC=π∗r2
C= 15394pm2(5)
Silicium Si: rSi= 110pm⇒σSi=π∗r2
Si= 38013pm2(6)
Using that one atomic unit 1 u= 1.66∗10−27kgwe get for the inverse
darkness ratios for the atoms mentioned:
Hydrogen H:σH
1u∗1.66∗10−27kg/u= 1.183∗106m2/kg(7)
Helium He:σHe
4u∗1.66∗10−27kg/u= 4.26∗105m2/kg (8)
Carbon C:σC
12u∗1.66∗10−27kg/u= 7.73∗105m2/kg (9)
Silicium Si:σSi
28u∗1.66∗10−27kg/u= 8.18∗105m2/kg(10)
In a dust grain say the atoms will typically shadow each other and thus
this ratio “the inverse darkness” will be smaller than if the atoms were all
exposed to the collision considered. If we denote the averag e number of
atoms lying in the shadow of one atom by “numberthickness” we will have
for the ratio for the full grain say
σ
M|grain=σ
M|atom
“numberthickness”. (11)
If we insert in the grain a mass-wise dominating bubble, the w hole
object will of course get a small ratio due to the higher mass,
σ
M|composed =σ
M|grain∗Mgrain
M, (12)
whereMis the mass of the bubble or if it dominates the whole composed
object, the dark matter particle.
On the average of course the ratioMgrain
Mof the dust around the bubble
and the bubble itself can never be bigger than the ratio of the amount of
8dust-suitable mass to dark matter in the universe. So noting that the grain
should largely be made by the elements heavier than helium, t he so called
“metals”, and that these make up only of the order of 1 % of the o rdinary
matter which again is only about 1/6 of the mass of the dark mat ter, we
must have
Mgrain
M≤1%/6 = 1/600. (13)
But really of course not all the “metal” has even reached out t o the in-
tergalactic medium, let alone been caught up by the dark matt er. So we
expect an appreciably smaller value for this ratio of dust ca ught by dark
matter relative to the dark matter itself.
In earlier papers we have already used the dark matter self-i nteraction
in the low velocity limit extracted from Correa’s ﬁt to the dw arf galaxy
data shown in Figure 4 to give:
σ
M|v−−>0= 15m2/kg. (14)
We now wish to crudely estimate the amount of dust that might p ile
up around a dark matter bubble with a given velocity during th e evolution
of the Universe. There are two important eﬀects to be taken int o account.
First of all the metal density was higher in the past due to the reduction
in the “radius” of the Universe by a factor (1 + z)−1wherezis the red
shift. Secondly the metallicity was lower in the past and we u se the linear
ﬁts of De Cia et al. [22] to its z dependence in our estimate of t he rate of
collection of metals by our pearls. We found that the most imp ortant time
for the rate of collection of metals corresponds to z= 3.3, when the age
of the Universe was 1.52 milliard years. At this time the rate of collecting
metals for a given velocity was about 8.4 times bigger than if using the
present metallicity and density.
So we might crudely estimate the amount of dust being collect ed by
an 8.4 times bigger density of metals than today in the 8.9 tim es younger
Universe, giving eﬀective numbers for the dust settling:
“metal density”eff= 3.71∗10−31kg/m3∗8.4 (15)
= 3.1∗10−30kg/m3(16)
= 1.7∗10−3GeV/c2/m3. (17)
For orientation we could ﬁrst ask how much metal-matter at al l could
be collected by a dust grain while already of the order of 10−7min size,
meaning a cross section of 10−14m2and with a velocity of say 300 km/s =
3∗105m/sduring an eﬀective age of the Universe of 1.52 milliard years =
4.8∗1016s. We obtain
9“available metals” = 3 ∗105m/s∗4.8∗1016s∗10−14m2∗3.1∗10−30kg/m3
= 4.4∗10−22kg (18)
= 2.4∗105GeV, (19)
which is to be compared to what the mass of a (10−7m)3large dust particle
with say speciﬁc weight 1000 kg/m3would be, namely 10−18kg.
So such a “normal” size dust grain could not collect itself in the average
conditions in the Universe.
However if the grain to be constructed had lower dimension th an 3,
then the cross section could be larger for the same hoped for v olume and
thus mass. Decreasing say the thickness in one of the dimensi ons from the
10−7mto atomic size 10−10mwould for the same collection of matter give
a 1000 times smaller mass. This would bring such a “normal siz e” grain
close to being just collectable in the average conditions in the Universe.
Our speculated stronger forces than usual due to the big homo lumo
gap would not help much, because the grain cannot catch the at oms in
intergalactic space which it does not come near enough to tou ch.
We shall now estimate the inverse darkness for such a dust gra in of
dimension 2 or less attached to a dark matter bubble. In this c ase there is
no shadowing of the dust atoms and the parameter “numberthic kness” in
equation (11) becomes unity. Also we estimated that in the ma in period
when the dust attached itself to the dark matter bubbles, we h adz= 3.3
andtheage oftheUniversewas 1.52milliard years. Thedensi ty of“metals”
at that time was a factor 10−1times the one today. So the factor 1 /600 in
equation (13) for the “metals” accessible to be caught by the dark matter
composite particle becomes
Mgrain
M= 1%/6/10 =1
6000. (20)
So takingσ
M|atom= 7∗105m2/kgfor the atoms of dust, we obtain our
estimate for the inverse darkness of the dark matter particl e composed
with a dust grain of dimension 2 or less

M|composed =σ
M|grain∗Mgrain
M(21)
= 7∗105m2/kg/6000 (22)

10should be compared with the value extracted from the dwarf ga laxy data

5.2 Size of Individual Dark Matter Particles
In the approximation of only gravitational interaction of d ark matter it is
well-known thatonlythe mass density matters, whereasthenumberdensity
or themass per particle is not observable.
With other than gravitational interactions one could hope t hat it would
be possible to extract from the ﬁts in say our model, what the p article size
should be. But the possibility for that in our model is remark ably bad!
The Correa measurement yields just the “inverse darkness” r atio

Our estimate for the rate of 3.5 keV radiation from dark matte r seen
by DAMA - very crudely - was based on:
•The total kinetic energy of the dark matter hitting the Earth perm2
pers(but not on how many particles).
•The main part of that energy goes into 3.5 keV radiation of ele ctrons.
•Estimateofa“suppression”factorforhowsmallapartofthi selectron
radiation comes from suﬃciently long living excitations to survive
down to 1400 m into the Earth.
None of this depends in our estimate on the size of the dark mat ter
particles (provided it lies inside a very broad range)!
If the dark matter particles were so heavy that the number den sity is
so low that the observation over an area of about 1 m2would not get an
event through every year, then it would contradict the DAMA d ata.
The rate of dark matter mass hitting a square meter of the Eart h is
Rate = 300 km/s∗0.3GeV/cm3(27)
= 3∗105m/s∗5.34∗10−22kg/m3(28)
= 1.6∗10−16kg/m2/s (29)
= 5∗10−9kg/m2/y (30)
Taking the DAMA area of observation ∼1m2we need to get more than
one passage per year and thus
M≤5∗10−9kg (31)
= 3∗1018GeV. (32)
11Figure 6: Simulated size distribution for dust grains.
Using the bubble internal mass density as estimated from the 3.5 keV ho-
molumo gap, this upper bound implies that the bubble radius R≤10−7m.
We can assume a typical grain size (see Figure 6) of 10−7m, say. Then
using the low velocity limitσ
M= 15m2/kggives
M= (10−7m)2/(15m2/kg) (33)
= 7∗10−16kg. (34)
But if now the dust grain is less than 2 dimensional, the area f or a grain
with the same weight as a massive 3 dimensional one would be mo re than
10−7m
10−10m= 1000 times bigger, i.e an area bigger than 10−11m2. Correcting
for this would give a bigger mass M≥7∗10−13kg.
6 Conclusion
We have reviewed and updated our dark matter model in which th e dark
matter consists of bubbles of a speculated new phase of the va cuum, in
which there has collected so much “ordinary” matter that the surface ten-
sion of the separation surface between the two types of vacuu m can be
spanned out. These pearls are here assumed to be surrounded b y a lower
than three dimensional grain of dust mainly made from atoms o f higher
atomic weight than hydrogen and helium.
We suppose that the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the grain of dust is so low
that the interaction between the pearls with their dust corr esponds to ef-
fectively having no shadowing of the grain atoms by each othe r (with added
up dimensionality less than 2). We used the general chemical abundances
12and estimated a low velocity inverse darkness of 120 m2/kgfor our pearls.
This is only one order of magnitude larger - thus it essential ly agrees with
- the value 15 m2/kgfound by Correa [38]. This is summarized in Table 1
as point 1.
In item 2 in the table we see that the estimate for the value v0of the
velocity at which the inverse darkness falls signiﬁcantly d own as a function
of the velocity is 0 .7cm/sif we do not take the hardening of the dust grain
seriously, while it is 77 km/sif we do take this hardening seriously. From
the Correa estimate using the dwarf galaxy data one ﬁnds v0= 220km/s,
so only the estimate taking the hardening seriously agrees w ith experiment.
The rest of the items in Table 1 are other order of magnitude es timates
checking the viability of our model. Thus item 3 estimates th e rate of
events in the DAMA-LIBRA experiment formulated in terms of t he quan-
titysuppression , which denotes the fraction of the excitations made in the
dark matter pearls on entering the Earth, which survive down until the
pearl reaches the detector.
The similar item 4 for the XENON1T experiment is now obsolete in
as far as the eﬀect found in this experiment was not reproduced after the
radon gas was better cleaned away in XENONnT, so it was probab lyβ
decay of214Pbthat was responsible for the previous eﬀect.
Item 5 called “Jeltema” represents the very strange observa tion of the
3.5keV-line from the Tycho Brahe supernova remnant, which should n ot
have enough dark matter to produce the 3 .5keV-line so as to be observed
at all. But due to our dark matter particles being excitable b y the large
amount of cosmic rays in the supernova remnant, we indeed cou ld get
agreement with the observed rate of 2 .2∗10−5photons/cm2coming from
the supernova remnant.
As item 6 we list the ﬁt of the overall factor in the ﬁt by Cline a nd
Frey to the 3 .5keV-line sources together with the very energy 3 .5keVby
one combination of our parameters for the modelξ1/4
fS
∆V. Actually this com-
bination is essentially the Fermi momentum of the electrons in the highly
compressed matter in the interior of our our bubbles. This ﬁt ting is only
sensitive to the density of the matter inside the pearls and d oes not depend
on the size of the pearls at the end. So this successful ﬁt actu ally originates
from earlier articles on our model, when we considered the pe arls to be
cm-sized and so heavy that an impact in Tunguska could have ca used a
major catastrophe [3].
Thelast item, item 7, justreviews the fact that we found appr oximately
thesame3 .5keVat ﬁrstinthreediﬀerent places. However nowafter thesad
development for our model in the recent XENONnT experiment [ 34] only
