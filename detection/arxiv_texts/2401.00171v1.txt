EQUATION
FABIO V. DIFONZO AND SABRINA F. PELLEGRINO
Abstract. We study the implementation of a Chebyshev spectral method with for-
ward Euler integrator proposed in [6] to investigate a peridynamic nonlocal formu-
lation of Richards’ equation. We prove the convergence of the fully-discretization of
the model showing the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the weak formula-
tion of the method by using the compactness properties of the approximated solution
and exploiting the stability of the numerical scheme. We further support our re-
sults through numerical simulations, using initial conditions with different order of
smoothness, showing reliability and robustness of the theoretical findings presented
in the paper.
1.Introduction
Richards’ equation is a prominent tool in the description of porous media phenom-
ena, specifically dealing with water movement in unsaturated soils. It is derived by
applying Darcy-Buckingham law to the law of mass conservation for an incompressible
porous medium and constant liquid density. Existence and uniqueness of the origi-
nal formulation of Richards’ equation are due to [46] (see also [36, 8] and references
therein). However, determining analytical solutions to Richards’ equation is prohibitive
under general setting on the constitutive relations typically used in the local formu-
lation of the equation, and so numerical procedures are needed to provide explicitly
computed solutions. As is well known, Richards’ equation is a highly nonlinear, and
possibly degenerate, parabolic equation, for which standard numerical schemes for par-
abolic equations fail to return reliable solutions. In fact, several approaches have been
investigated according to the nature of soil through which water movement occurs: for
homogeneous soils we refer to, among others, [4, 12, 28, 19]; for heterogeneous media
several different approaches have been proposed, using piecewise smooth dynamical sys-
tem tools (see [5, 10]); linear domain decomposition (see [2, 43]); Kirchhoff transform
(see [9, 45]); finite element methods (see [35, 3]); formal asymptotics (see [27]). As a
general reference for the numerical features in Richards’ equation, the interested reader
is referred to the survey [18], whereas [39] frames Richards’ equation into the context
of hydrological modeling.
However, as common in diffusion phenomena through porous media, a nonlocal ap-
proach carries features and properties possibly useful for further analysis. This idea
traces back to the ’60s (see [42]), and since then there has been an increasing interest,

involving nonlocal behaviors in the hydraulic conductivity (see [20]); fractional terms
in the time derivative of water content (see [38, 26]); or, also, using memory component
in modeling water stress in the root water uptake (see [47, 14, 7, 11]).
In the context of nonlocal formulations of Richards’ equation, [16] extended the equa-
tion to incorporate nonlocal effects, providing a foundation for studying capillary flows.
Later, in [24], the peridynamic paradigm has been applied to better describe the porous
media and the dynamics of water therein, paving the way for a powerful approach to
deal with the nonlinear terms in Richards’ equation.
However, these nonlocal variants introduce challenges and opportunities, requiring spe-
cialized numerical schemes. In [6] authors propose an explicit Euler numerical scheme,
based on Chebyshev spectral method, to solve a nonlocal formulation of Richards’ equa-
tion. Therein and in [17], several examples have been provided supporting the properties
that the proposed numerical scheme should retain order 2 in space and order 1 in time,
under mild smoothness assumptions on the initial conditions.
Spectral methods seem to be very efficient and accurate when applied to nonlocal
peridynamic models. Indeed, they can benefit of the convolution-based definition of
the integral operator and as a consequence they can exploit the properties of the Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. Following this idea, in [15, 40] the authors perform
a comparison between the implementation of Fourier spectral methods and quadrature
formulas. However, trigonometric polynomials need to require periodic boundary con-
ditions, so they cannot be applied alone to more general models. A way to overcome
the issue is to make a volume penalization at the boundaries as in [30, 25, 33] or to
replace Fourier polynomials by Chebyshev polynomials, as in [32, 31, 34].
Spectral spatial discretization based on the approximation of the solution by means
of a finite series of Chebyshev polynomials is suitable to incorporate Dirichlet bound-
ary conditions and allows to get a high-order accuracy when applied to the nonlocal
peridynamic formulation of Richards’ equation (see, for instance, [6]).
The convergence analysis of a specific numerical scheme tailored for the nonlocal
variant is the focus of this paper, building upon state-of-the-art techniques in numerical
analysis, mesh-free methods, and adaptive discretization strategies (see also [1]).
The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present the
model, its spatial discretization and we recall the convergence result for the semi-discrete
scheme. Section 3 is devoted to the deduction of the fully spectral discretization of the
model and provide a rigorous proof of its convergence to a weak solution to the proposed
nonlocal Richards’ model. Section 4 provides some numerical simulations and finally
Section 5 concludes the paper.ANALYSIS OF A SPECTRAL METHOD FOR A PERIDYNAMIC RICHARDS’ EQUATION 3
2.A nonlocal formulation of Richards’ equation based on peridynamics
We consider the following peridynamic formulation of Richards’ equation with Dirich-

denote the peridynamic integral operator in (2.1). It represents the nonlocal counterpart
of the diffusivity term, as it takes into account long-range interactions between water
particles (see [44, 37]). The length of such interactions is parameterized by the positive
scalar value δcalled horizon . Due to the absence of partial spatial derivatives, the
model is able to remain consistent even in presence of singularities and, therefore, it can
incorporate desiccation cracks. Additionally, the function φis the so-called influence
function and represents the convolution kernel of the model, which operates as the
weight of the discrete mean value of the spatial interactions.
The behavior of this function strongly defines the profile of the solution and its
dispersive effects. In particular, in [6], in order to allow the boundary conditions to be
effective in the model, the authors define a distributed influence function in the following
way (see Figure 1)
(2.3) φδ(z):=(|z|−1+δ
δ,|z| ≥1−δ,
0, |z|<1−δ.
Due to the nonlinearity of the model, a numerical approach is needed in order to
study the properties of the solution. In particular, in [6] the model is discretized by
using Chebyshev spectral collocation scheme for spatial discretization with forward
Euler method for the time marching. Moreover, the authors prove the convergence
of the semi-discrete method by projecting the approximated solution into the space
of Chebyshev polynomials and exploiting the Lipschitz continuity of the peridynamic
operator Lin (2.2).
Additionally, the authors show numerically the convergence of the fully-discrete
scheme without providing a rigorous proof. The aim of this work is to complete the
analysis adding the proof of the convergence of the fully-discrete scheme showing the
compactness and stability properties of the approximated solution.
In what follows, we recall the construction of the spectral method for the spatial
discretization and its convergence. We refer the reader to [6] for more details. Moreover,4 F.V. DIFONZO AND S.F. PELLEGRINO

Given an arbitrary function ψ(t), we write ψnas the value of ψatt=n∆t. The
backward difference form is dtψn= (ψn−ψn−1)/∆tfor any sequence {θn}.

In this section, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to (3.2) and
that such solution converges to the solution of the continuous model (2.1) as ∆ t→0
andN→ ∞ . To do so, we prove some preliminary Lemmas.
The following result provides a nonlocal counterpart of the maximum principle for
strong solution of parabolic equations.

for any z∈[−1,1]andt∈[0, T].
As a consequence of Lemma 3.1 we can assume that the water content θin (2.1) is
uniformly bounded.
Lemma 3.2. LetθN
m(z)be the solution to the fully-discrete scheme (3.2). Then,
L(θN

4.Numerical Simulations
In this section we test our proposed method on different soils with different initial
conditions: in Example 4.1 we use a function with a discontinuity in its first derivative;
in Example 4.2 we use a periodic function. Moreover, in both cases a sink forcing term
S(z) is active as in (2.1), representing the water uptake due to root systems.
Also, we consider the classical Van Genuchten-Mualem constitutive relations in the
unsaturated zone, given by

5.Conclusions
We have studied a fully-discrete spectral scheme for a nonlocal formulation of Richards’
equation based on the peridynamic theory. We prove the convergence of the method
to the unique weak solution to the problem as the timestep size tends to zero and the
total number of collocation points used for the discretization of the spatial domain goes
to infinity. The proof is based on the fact that the numerical approximation of the
solution satisfies the stability and the compactness properties. Finally, we have given
some simulations to show a numerical verification of the existence of weak solution to
our model.
The present work suggests several possible directions for future and already ongoing
research studies. In particular, it would be of interest study the convergence of the
scheme when we reduce the regularity of the initial conditions to a Radon measure
(see for instance [29]). Moreover, we plan to construct a generalization of the model
to 2D in order to represent and to study the evolution of desiccation cracks implicitly
incorporated into the model. To do this, in order to avoid the Gibbs’ phenomenon near
discontinuities, we would investigate the implementation of a filtering strategy coupled
with the Chebyshev spectral discretization as in [41].
