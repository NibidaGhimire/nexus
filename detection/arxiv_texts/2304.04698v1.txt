Abstract. For every n¥2, the surface Houghton group Bnis
dened as the asymptotically rigid mapping class group of a surface
with exactly nends, all of them non-planar. The groups Bnare
analogous to, and in fact contain, the braided Houghton groups.
These groups also arise naturally in topology: every monodromy
homeomorphisms of a bered component of a depth-1 foliation of
closed 3-manifold is conjugate into some Bn. As countable mapping
class groups of innite type surfaces, the groups Bnlie somewhere
between classical mapping class groups and big mapping class
groups. We initiate the study of surface Houghton groups proving,
among other things, that Bnis of type Fn1, but not of type FPn,
analogous to the braided Houghton groups.
1.Introduction and results
Forn¥2, denote by  nthe connected orientable surface with exactly
nends, all of them non-planar. We view  nas constructed by rst
gluing a torus with two boundary components (called a piece) to every
connected component of a sphere with nboundary components, and
then inductively gluing a piece to every boundary component of the
surface from the previous step. The surface Houghton group ,Bn, is
the subgroup of the mapping class group Mappnqwhose elements
eventually send pieces to pieces, in a trivial manner; see Section 2 for a
precise denition.
Viewed in this light, the groups Bnare natural analogs of the
asymptotic mapping class groups of Cantor surfaces considered in
[16,18,2,19,1]. In addition, these groups are closely related to
Houghton groups and their braided relatives [ 9]. In fact, using Funar's
description of the braided Houghton group brHnas an asymptotically
rigid mapping class group [ 15], in Remark 2.2 below we briey explain
how to see that br Hnmay be realized as a subgroup of Bn.

Beyond this analogy, the groups Bnarise naturally in the study
of depth-1 foliations of closed 3{manifolds. More precisely, the non-
product components are mapping tori of end-periodic homeomorphisms
(see [ 14]), and every such homeomorphism is conjugate into some Bn
(see [13, Corollary 2.9]).
1.1.Finiteness properties. Recall that a group is of type Fdif it has
a classifying space with nite d-skeleton, and that it is of type FPd
if the integers, regarded as a trivial module over the group, have a
projective resolution that is of nite type in dimensions up to d. Such a
resolution can be obtained for a group of type Fdby using the cellular
chain complex of the universal cover of a classifying space. Thus, Fd
implies FP d.
In [19], Genevois{Lonjou{Urech proved that the braided Houghton
group brHnis of type Fn1but not of type FPn. Our rst result is the
analog of this result in our setting.
Theorem 1.1. Bnis of type F n1but not of type FP n.
In order to prove Theorem 1.1, and as is often the case with this type
of result, we will make use of a classical criterion of Brown [ 7], expressed
through the language of discrete Morse theory; see Section 3 for details.
More precisely, for each n¥2 we will construct a nite-dimensional
contractible cube complex on which Bnacts, and an invariant discrete
Morse function on the complex, such that the descending links are
highly connected. In the construction of the complex as well as in the
analysis of descending links, we make heavy use of methods developed
in [1].
1.2.Abelianization. A well-known theorem of Powell [ 29] asserts that
thepure mapping class group PMappSqof a nite-type surface Sof
genus at least three has trivial abelianization. For the surfaces  n, a
result of Patel, Vlamis, and the rst author [ 4, Corollary 6] implies that
H1pPMappnq;ZqZn1. More generally, the abelianization of (pure)
mapping class groups of innite type surfaces is more complicated; see
[10,11,24,26,30]. Using [ 4], we compute the abelianization Bab
nofBn,
as well as that of their pure counterparts PBn.
Theorem 1.2. For alln¥2,Bab
nt0uandPBab
nZn1.
From the description of the abelianizations, we also describe all
nite quotients of Bn, proving that they are highly constrained; see
Proposition 6.2. This has the following consequence.
Corollary 1.3. For allm;nPN, the groups BnandbrHmare not
commensurable.SURFACE HOUGHTON GROUPS 3
1.3.Marking graphs. By Theorem 1.1, Bnis nitely generated for
alln¥2, and so it has a well-dened coarse geometry. In the nite
type setting, a quasi-isometric model for the mapping class group which
has proven quite useful is Masur and Minsky's marking graph [ 25].
For the surfaces  n, the marking graph is no longer a good model for
several reasons. A trivial issue is that it is disconnected, and the orbit
of a marking may lie in dierent components. There are Bn{invariant
components, but even these are problematic since they are no longer
locally nite. Worse, the orbit map to any such component fails to be
a quasi-isometric embedding (see Section 7). On the other hand, there
are (many) locally nite subgraphs which do serve as quasi-isometric
models, by the following and the Milnor- Svarc Lemma (see e.g. [6]).
Theorem 1.4. For alln¥2, there exists locally nite subgraphs of the
marking graph on which Bnacts cocompactly. For n¥3, any marking
is contained in such a subgraph.
The nal statement is not quite true for n2 since there are markings
on  2with innite stabilizer in Bn.
Plan of the paper. Section 2 contains the relevant background on
surfaces, mapping class groups, and the denition of Bn, and in Section 3
we recall a classical result of Brown [ 7] about niteness properties
of groups, and describe the relevant tools in our setting. Section 4
constructs a contractible cube complex on which Bnacts nicely, and
which is similar to that of [ 19,1]. In Section 5 we will prove Theorem
1.1. We then prove Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.3 in Section 6 and
Theorem 1.4 in Section 7.

2.Surfaces
Throughout this paper, all surfaces will be assumed to be connected,
orientable and second-countable. A surface is said to have nite type
if its fundamental group is nitely generated; otherwise, it has innite
type. In this paper, the primary surfaces of innite type we will consider
are those that have a nite number of ends, all non-planar; see Section
2.3 for an explicit construction.
2.1.Curves and arcs. By a curve on a surface Swe mean the isotopy
class of a simple closed curve on S. All curves will be essential , meaning
they do not bound a disk or once-punctured disk, nor do they cobound
an annulus with a component of BS. An arcis the isotopy class (relative
toBS) of an embedded path that connects two boundary components
ofS. We say that two curves/arcs are disjoint if they can be isotoped
o each other. As usual, we will not distinguish between curves (resp.
arcs) and their representatives.4 ARAMAYONA, BUX, KIM, AND LEININGER
2.2.Mapping class groups. The mapping class group MappSqofSis
the group of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms
ofS; here all homeomorphisms and isotopies are assumed to x the
boundary of Spointwise. The pure mapping class group PMappSqis
the subgroup of MappSqwhose elements x every end of S. WhenS
has nite type, then MappSqis well-known to be of type F8[20]. On
the other hand, when Shas innite type, then MappSqis uncountable.
WhenShas innite type, an important subgroup of MappSq(and
ofPMappSq, in fact) is the compactly-supported mapping class group
MapcpSq, which consists of those mapping classes that are the identity
outside some compact subset of S. By a result of Patel-Vlamis [ 28],
MapcpSqis dense (in the compact-open topology) inside PMappSqif
and only if Shas at most one non-planar end; otherwise, PMappSqis
topologically generated by MapcpSqplus the set of handle-shifts .
2.3.Rigid structures and surface Houghton groups. The goal of
this subsection is to describe the surfaces  nand the additional structure
eluded to in the introduction necessary to dene their asymptotic
mapping class groups. These denitions, along with the toolkit needed
to present it, closely follows [1, Section 3].
Fix an integer n¥2. LetOnbe a sphere with nboundary compo-
nents, labelled b1;:::;bn, andTa torus with two boundary components,
denotedBTandB T; we refer toB Tas the topboundary component
ofT. We x, once and for all, an orientation-reversing homeomor-
phism:BTÑ B T, and orientation-reversing homeomorphisms
i:BTÑbi, fori1;:::;n . We construct a sequence of compact,
connected, orientable surfaces pMiqias follows:
M1On;
M2is the result of gluing a copy of Tto each boundary com-
ponent ofOn, using the homeomorphisms i;
For eachi¥3,Miis the result of gluing a copy of Talong
each of the boundary components of Mi1, using the homeo-
morphism.
The surface  nis the union of the surfaces Miabove. The closure of
each of the connected components of MirMi1, fori¥2, is called a
piece . By construction, each piece BMirMi1is one of the glued
on copies of T, and so is equipped with a canonical homeomorphism
iB:BÑT. We call the unique boundary component of Bthat belongs
toMi1thetopboundary component of Bas it maps by iBtoB T.
The set
tB:Bis a pieceu
is called the rigid structure on n.
A subsurface of  nissuited if it is connected and is the union of On
and nitely many pieces. A boundary component of a suited subsurface
is called a suited curve .SURFACE HOUGHTON GROUPS 5
Letf: nÑnbe a homeomorphism. We say that fisasymptoti-
cally rigid if there exists a suited subsurface Zn, called a dening
surface forf, such that:
fpZqis a suited subsurface, and
fisrigid away from Z, that is, for every piece BnrZ,
we have that fpBqis a piece, and f|B1
fpBqB.
Denition 2.1 (Surface Houghton group) .The surface Houghton group
Bnis the subgroup of the mapping class group Mappnqwhose elements
have an asymptotically rigid representative.
We will denote by PBnthe intersection of Bnwith the pure mapping
class group PMap pnq.
Remark 2.2. In [15], Funar described the braided Houghton groups
brHnas asymptotically rigid mapping class groups of certain planar
surfaces. Replacing punctures of this planar surface with boundary
components, and then doubling the resulting surface, determines a
homomorphism brHnÑBnanalogous to the construction Ivanov-
McCarthy [23, Section 2].
3.Finiteness properties
3.1.Brown's criterion for niteness properties. In this section
we recall a classical criterion, due to Brown [ 7], for a group to (not) have
certain niteness properties. We remark that our formulation of the
criterion diers from the original [ 7], as we use the language of discrete
Morse theory as developed in [ 5]. We recall here the basic notions and
denitions, referring the interested reader to [ 5] or [ 1, Appendix A] for
a thorough discussion.
Our setting is a group Gacting on a piecewise euclidean CW-complex
Xby cell-permuting homeomorphisms that restrict to isometries on
cells. A Morse function onXis a cell-wise ane map h:XÑR
satisfying the condition that on each closed cell it attains a unique
maximum (at a vertex, the top vertex of the cell). The descending link
lkÓpvqof a vertex vis the part of its link spanned by the links of cells
that contain vas their top vertex. The value hpvqis often referred to
as the height ofv.
We consider the vertices the critical points inXand the images of
vertices under hare the critical values . A Morse function h:XÑR
discrete if the set of its critical values is a discrete subset of R. Now
the rst theorem can be stated as follows.
Theorem 3.1 (Brown) .LetGbe a group acting by cell-wise isometries
on a contractible piecewise euclidean CW-complex X. AssumeXis
equipped with a discrete G-invariant Morse function h:XÑR, and let
X¤sdenote the largest subcomplex of Xfully contained in the preimage
h1p8;ss. Suppose that6 ARAMAYONA, BUX, KIM, AND LEININGER
The quotient of X¤sbyGis nite for all critical values s.
Every cell stabilizer is of type F 8.
There exists d¥1such that, for suciently large critical values
sand for every vertex of vPXwithhpvq¥s, the descending
link ofvinXisd-spherical , i.e.,pd1q-connected and of
dimensiond.
For each critical value s, there exists a vertex vwith non-
contractible descending link at height hpvq¥s.
ThenGis of type F dbut not of type FP d 1.
Proof. This proof mimics Brown's proof of [7, Corollary 3.3].
As the set of critical values is discrete, we can index them in order.
Now, we consider the ltration of Xby sublevel complexes Xi:X¤si
wheresiruns through the critical values in order. The ltration step
Xi 1is obtained from Xiup to homotopy by coning o descending links.
Thus, the hypothesis that descending links are pd1q-connected implies
that the inclusion of XiintoXi 1induces isomophisms in homotopy
(and homology) groups up to dimension d1 and an epimorphism in
homotopy (and homology) in dimension d. As we assume the complex
Xto be contractible, the isomophisms in dimensions below dmust
eventually all be trivial maps. It follows that for suciently large i,
the sublevel complex Xiispd1q-connected. By [ 7, Propositions 1.1
and 3.1] implies that Gis of type F d.
For the negative direction, we focus on the system tHdpXiquiof
homology groups in dimension d. We already observed that for ilarge
enough, the morphisms in the system are onto. Hence, the system
can only be essentially trivial if the homology groups HdpXiqvanish
for all large enough i. If, however, at the transition from XitoXi 1,
we encounter a non-contractible pd1q-connected descending link of
dimension d, this descending link will have non-trivial homology in
dimensiond. Hence the descending link contains a d-cycle. If this cycle
was a boundary in Xi, coning o the descending link would provide
another way of bounding it in Xi 1, thus creating a non-trivial pd 1q-
cycle, which is impossible as that element of Hd 1could never be killed
in the future as we only ever cone o d-dimensional links. Hence,
HdpXiq0 for innitely many i. 
It is clear from the criterion that tools for the analysis of connectivity
properties of spaces can be useful. We collect the tools that we will
need in this case.
3.2.Propagating connectivity properties. We use the convention
that every space is p2q-connected and that any non-empty space is
p1q-connected if it is non-empty.
3.2.1. Complete joins. We will deduce connectivity properties of com-
plexes from those of other complexes, and maps between them. One waySURFACE HOUGHTON GROUPS 7
to do this is formalized through the notion of a complete join complex ,
introduced by Hatcher and Wahl in [22].
Denition 3.2 (Complete join complex) .LetYandXbe simplicial
complexes, and :YÑXa simplicial map. We say that Yis a
complete join complex overX(with respect to the map ) if the
following properties are satised
is surjective, and is injective on individual simplices.
For each simplex xv0;:::;vdy, its preimage can be written
as a join of bers over vertices:
1pq1pv0q1pvdq:
Sinceis injective on simplices, the -preimages of vertices are
discrete sets of vertices in Y. They are non-empty since is surjective.
It follows that for each d-simplexinX, the-preimage1pqis a
join ofd 1 non-empty discrete sets.
We make use of a complete join in two places, once to transfer known
connectivity properties from XtoY, and once to go the other way.
The rst direction is the dicult one, and has been established by
Hatcher{Wahl [22].
Before stating the result, recall that a simplicial complex is weakly
Cohen{Macaulay of dimension k 1 if it isk{connected and if the link
of every simplex ispkdimpq1q{connected.
Proposition 3.3. [22, Proposition 3.5] Suppose:YÑXis a com-
plete join. If Xis weakly Cohen{Macaulay of dimension k 1, then so
isY.
Going forward is the easy direction (and is implicit in the argument
given by Hatcher and Wahl [ 22]). See [ 1, Remark A.15] for an explicit
account.
Proposition 3.4. Suppose:YÑXis a complete join. Then Xis
a retract of Yand inherits all properties that can be expressed by the
vanishing of group-valued functors or cofunctors. In particular, if Yis
k-connected, then so is X.
Similarly, complete joins are easily prevented from being contractible.
Observation 3.5. Let:YÑXbe a complete join, and suppose that
there is a top-dimensional simplex xv0;:::;vdyinXsuch that each
vertex ber 1pviqcontains at least two points. Then, the ber over
contains ad-sphere which denes a cycle in the homology of Ythat
cannot be a boundary as Ydoes not contain simplices of dimension
d 1. In particular, Yis not contractible.
3.2.2. The bad simplex argument. A map from a complete join is a
particularly nice projection. The bad simplex argument , introduced by
Hatcher and Vogtmann [ 21], uses the inclusion map of a subcomplex8 ARAMAYONA, BUX, KIM, AND LEININGER
together with additional local information to transfer connectivity prop-
erties from the ambient complex to the subcomplex. We do not follow
the original exposition of the argument, since we nd the language
introduced in [1] more convenient.
LetXbe a simplicial complex and assume that we are given a map
ÞÑthat assigns to each simplex inXa (possibly empty) face, ,
of. We assume that the following two conditions are satised:
Monotonicity: ¤ùñ ¤:
Idempotence: :
We call the simplex good ifis empty and badif. Note that
by monotonicity, the good simplices in Xform a subcomplex Xgood,
which we call the good subcomplex .
The good link of a bad simplex is the geometric realization of the
poset of those proper cofaces ¡for which holds, i.e.,
lkgoodpq:t¡|u
The following proposition is due to Hatcher{Vogtmann [ 21, Sec-
tion 2.1], but this wording is taken from [1, Proposition A.7].
Proposition 3.6. Assume that for some number k¥1and every
bad simplex , the good link lkgoodpqispkdimpqq-connected. Then
the inclusion XgoodãÑXinduces isomorphisms in dfor alld¤kand
an epimorphism in k 1.
4.A contractible cube complex
The strategy for proving Theorem 1.1 is well-known, and is similar
to that used in [ 8,19,1], for instance. Namely, we will construct a
contractible complex Xon which Bnacts in such way that we can apply
Brown's [7] criterion described in Section 3 above.
We now proceed to do this. The denitions of the main objects are
the word-for-word adaptations of the ones in [ 1], and the only dier-
ences with our situation will occur when we analyze the connectivity
properties of descending links. For this reason, we will briey recall the
constructions from [ 1, Section 5], referring to that article for a more
thorough presentation.
Consider ordered pairs pZ;fq, whereZnis a suited subsurface
andfPBn. Two such pairs pZ1;f1qandpZ2;f2qare said to be equiv-
alent iff1
2f1pZ1qZ2andf1
2f1is rigid in the complement of
Z1. Intuitively, the equivalence class of pZ;fqrecords the \non-rigid"
behavior of foutsideZ. For example, if fPBnis the identity outside
a suited subsurface Z, thenpZ;fqis equivalent to pZ;idq. As another
useful example to keep in mind, observe that pZ;f 1qandpZ;f 2qare
equivalent if f1
2f1leavesZinvariant and is rigid outside Z.SURFACE HOUGHTON GROUPS 9
We denote the equivalence class of pZ;fqbyrZ;fs, and the set of all
equivalence classes by S. The group Bnacts on S, by setting
grZ;fsrZ;gfs:
We dene the complexity of a pairpZ;fqas above to be the genus
ofZ. Alternatively, observe that since Zis a suited subsurface, it is
the union of Onand some number of pieces. As each piece contributes
1 to the genus, the complexity is simply the number of pieces in Z.
Clearly, equivalent pairs have equal complexity, and the action preserves
complexity, so we have a Bn{invariant complexity function
h:SÑZR:
Given vertices x1;x2PS, we say that x1 x2if there are representa-
tivespZi;fiqofxi, fori1;2, so thatf1f2,Z1Z2, andZ2rZ1
is a disjoint union of pieces. We stress that  is not a partial order.
The relation  can be used to construct a cube complex Xfor which
Sis the 0{skeleton. Given x1 x2, the settx|x1¨x¨x2uare the
vertices of a d{cube, with dhpx2qhpx1q. We callx1thebottom
of the cube, as it uniquely minimizes complexity over all its vertices.
Since nhas exactly nends, the complex Xisn-dimensional.
Observe that the action BnonSpreserves the cubical structure,
and that the complexity function hextends linearly over cubes to a
Bn-invariant complexity function (of the same name)
h:XÑR :
Fork¥1, write X¤kfor the subcomplex of Xspanned by those
vertices with complexity ¤k. A direct translation of the arguments of
Proposition 5.7 and Lemmas 6.2 and 6.3 of [1] yields the following:
Theorem 4.1. The cube complex Xis contractible, and the action of
BnonXsatises:
LetCbe a cube with bottom vertex xrZ;fs. Then the Bn-
stabilizer of Cis isomorphic to a nite extension of MappZq.
In particular, every cube stabilizer is of type F8.
For everyk¥1, the quotient of X¤kbyBnis compact.
In light of the theorem above, in order to apply Brown's Theorem
3.1, we need to prove that descending links have the correct connec-
tivity properties. As was the case in [ 1], the connectivity properties
of descending links are determined by those of piece complexes , whose
denition we now recall:
Denition 4.2 (Piece complex) .LetZbe a compact surface with
boundary, and let Qbe a collection of boundary circles. We dene the
piece complex PpZ;Qqto be the simplicial subcomplex of the curve
complex of Zwhose vertices are separating curves which, together with
a boundary circle from Q, bound a genus 1 subsurface. If QBZ, we
will write PpZ;QqPpZq.10 ARAMAYONA, BUX, KIM, AND LEININGER
The relation between the two complexes is encapsulated by the fol-
lowing result, whose proof is exactly the same as that of [ 1, Proposition
6.6].
Proposition 4.3. LetxrZ;idsbe a vertex of X. Then, the descend-
ing link lkÓpxqis a complete join over the piece complex PpZq.
An immediate consequence of Propositions 4.3 and 3.3 is the following.
Corollary 4.4. IfPpZqis weakly Cohen{Macaulay of dimension k,
then so is the descending link lkÓpZq.
Before we end this section, we will need a little more information about
this complete join for the proof of the negative part of Theorem 1.1.
To explain, we rst recall that for xrZ;ids, the complete join map
: lkÓpxqÑPpZqis dened as follows. Given rW;gsPlkÓpxq, there is
a pieceYnso thatWYYis a suited subsurface and rWYY;gs
xrZ;ids. It follows that gpWYYqZandgpYqis thus a vertex of
PpZq. We then dene prW;gsqgpYq. With this, we now state the
lemma we will need.
Lemma 4.5. For every vertex XPPpZq, the ber in lkÓpxqis innite.
Proof. GivenXprW;gsqgpYqas above, we need to show that
1pXqis innite. For this, we let h:YÑYbe any homeomorphism
representing an element of MappYq. We extend hby the identity outside
Yto a homeomorphism of the same name, which thus represents an
element of Bn. Observe that ghpWYYq gpWYYq Zand
ghpYq gpYq Z, whileghis rigid outside ZWYY, so
rW;ghsrZ;ids, and thusrW;ghsPlkÓpxqwithprW;ghsq
ghpYqgpYqX. That is,rW;ghsP1pXqis another vertex.
Moreover,rW;ghs  rW;gsif and only if g1ghhis rigid
outsideW(up to isotopy). Since Yis a piece outside W, this can only
happen ifhis isotopic (in  n) to a homeomorphism which restricts to
the identity in Y. This is only possibly if the original homeomorphism
hofYrepresents the identity in MappYq, modulo Dehn twisting in
the essential component of BYinZ(which can be \absorbed" into
W). Since MappYqmodulo the (central) subgroup generated by Dehn
twisting in this component of BYis innite, it follows that 1pXqis
innite, as required. 
5.Connectivity properties of piece complexes
In this section, we shall establish connectivity properties of piece
complexes and nally deduce the niteness properties of Bn.
Theorem 5.1. The piece complex PpZ;Qqof a compact surface is
k-connected, provided that gpZq¥2k 3and|Q|¥k 2.
Let us rst observe that this implies that piece complexes are Cohen{
Macaulay.SURFACE HOUGHTON GROUPS 11
Corollary 5.2. The piece complex PpZ;Qqis weakly Cohen{Macaulay
of dimension k 1, provided that gpZq¥2k 3and|Q|¥k 2.
Proof. Observe that the link of a d-simplexinPpZ;Qqis isomorphic
to the piece complex PpZ1;Q1qwhereZ1is obtained from Zby cutting
o the pieces in andQ1is the set of those boundary circles in Qthat
still exist in Z1. Then,
gpZ1qgpZqpdimpq 1q¥2k 3dimpq1¥2pkdimpq1q 3
and|Q1||Q|pdimpq 1q¥pkdimpq1q 2. This implies
the link ofispkdimpq1q{connected, in view of Theorem 5.1, as
required. 
To analyze the connectivity properties of piece complexes, we shall
introduce two more complexes: the injective tethered handle complex
T H 1pZ;Qq, which we will see is a complete join over PpZ;Qq; and
thetethered handle complex T HpZ;Qq, which contains the injective
tethered handle complex as a subcomplex. As before, if QBZwe
will simply write T H 1pZ;QqT H 1pZqandT HpZ;QqT HpZq. A
diagram of the maps we use reads as follows:
lkÓprZ;fsq T H 1pZq T HpZq
PpZq
We have used the left arrow to pull back connectivity from the piece
complex to the descending link. We shall use the middle arrow to push
forward connectivity from the injective handle complex to the piece
complex, and we will use the inclusion of T H 1pZqintoT HpZqto apply
abad simplex argument , pulling back connectivity from the tethered
handle complex to the injective handle complex. The connectivity of
the tethered handle complex itself has been analyzed in [1].
5.1.Tethered handle complexes. LetZdenote a compact con-
nected orientable surface with boundary. By a handle inZwe mean a
subsurface of Zthat avoids the boundary BZand is homeomorphic to
a one-holed torus.
Given a handle T, consider (the isotopy class of) a simple arc that
joinsBTto a component bZ. We remark that the isotopy class of 
is not taken relative to its endpoints, as is sometimes the case. Observe
that the regular neighborhood of TYYbis a piece. We will refer to
the union of Tandas a tethered handle tethered to bwith handle T
and tether.
Denition 5.3 (Tethered handle complex) .LetZbe a compact ori-
entable connected surface, and let Qbe a collection of boundary circles
ofZ. The tethered handle complex T HpZ;Qqis the simplicial complex12 ARAMAYONA, BUX, KIM, AND LEININGER
whosed-simplices are sets of d 1 pairwise disjoint tethered handles,
each tethered to an element of Q.
The following is Lemma 10.12 of [ 1], which builds upon work of
Hatcher-Vogtmann [21]:
Lemma 5.4. The tethered handle complex T HpZ;Qqisk-connected,
provided that Qis not empty and gpZq¥2k 3.
We consider the following subcomplex of the tethered handle complex.
Denition 5.5 (Injective tethered handle complex) .The injective
tethered handle complex T H 1pZ;Qqis the subcomplex of T HpZ;Qq
consisting of those simplices where the involved handles are tethered to
pairwise distinct boundary components in Q.
The reason why we are interested in this subcomplex is that it
is a complete join over the piece complex, which allows us to push
forward its connectivity. Indeed, we already oberved that a small
regular neighborhood of a tethered handle together with its boundary
component is homeomorphic to a piece. In this way we obtain a
simplicial map
:T H 1pZ;QqÑPpZ;Qq:
The following is [ 1, Lemma 8.8], and the proof applies verbatim to
this setting:
Proposition 5.6. The map:T H 1pZ;QqÑPpZ;Qqis a complete
join.
In particular, if T H 1pZ;Qqisk-connected, then so is PpZ;Qqby
Proposition 3.4. Thus, we have now reduced the problem to analyzing
the connectivity properties of the injective tethered handle complex
T H 1pZ;Qq.
Theorem 5.7. The injective tethered handle complex T H 1pZ;Qqis
k-connected, provided that gpZq¥2k 3and|Q|¥k 2.
Proof. We induct on kstarting at k1, which is trivial. For k¥0,
we use the bad simplex argument for the inclusion of T H 1pZ;Qqinto
T HpZ;Qq.
Consider a simplex inT HpZ;Qqand dene to consist of those
tethered handles in that are tethered to the same boundary component
as another handle in . Note that T H 1pZ;Qqconsists precisely of those
simplicesfor which is empty, i.e., the good simplices of T HpZ;Qq.
See Figure 5.1.
Now consider a bad simplex . It takes at least two handles teth-
ered to the same boundary component to make a bad simplex. Hence,SURFACE HOUGHTON GROUPS 13
Figure 1. The gure illustrates an example of Zwhere
g5 andQBZhas three components. There are three
tethered handles, which dene a 2{simplex , while is
a 1{simplex spanned by the two tethered handles on the

genus 3 and three boundary components, but Q1consists
of just the two components on the right.

Note that the good link lkgoodpqis isomorphic to T H 1pZ1;Q1q, where
Z1is obtained from Zby cutting o, for each boundary circle used in
, a neighborhood of the boundary circle and all tethers and handles of
that it meets. The set Q1consists of those boundary circles in Qthat
still exist in Z1. See Figure 5.1. Then, we note the following inequalities
which allow us to apply the induction hypothesis.

By the induction hypothesis, lkgoodpqis thereforepkdimpqq-connected.
By Proposition 3.6, the inclusion T H 1pZ;QqãÑT HpZ;Qqinduces
isomorphisms in dfor alld¤k. AsT HpZ;Qqisk-connected by
Lemma 5.4, T H 1pZ;Qqisk-connected. 14 ARAMAYONA, BUX, KIM, AND LEININGER
Proof of Theorem 5.1. The result follows from the combination of Propo-
sition 5.6 and Theorem 5.7, appealing to Proposition 3.4. 
5.2.Proof of Theorem 1.1. The group Bnacts on Xleaving the
discrete Morse function h:XÑRinvariant. Sublevel complexes are
Bn-cocompact, and cell stabilizers are of type F 8by Theorem 4.1.
By the above analysis, descending links of vertices are of dimension
n1, and for vertices of height h¥2n, they arepn2q-connected. By
Proposition 4.3 and Lemma 4.5, the descending links are complete joins
with innite vertex bers over a complex of nite dimension, hence they
are not contractible by Observation 3.5.
Now the hypotheses of Brown's criterion 3.1 have been veried and
the group Bnis of type F n1but not of type FP n.
6.Abelianization
In this section we prove Theorem 1.2. The arguments rely on construc-
tion of non-trivial, integer-valued homomorphisms from pure mapping
class groups of [ 4], which we briey recall here for the particular case of
then-pronged surfaces  n.
Letbe an oriented curve that separates an end Eof nfrom the
rest, where the orientation is chosen so that the component of  nto
the right of is a neighborhood of E. Then,denes a nonzero element
rsPHsep
1pS;Zq, the subgroup of H1pS;Zqspanned by homology classes
of separating curves.
To everyfPPMappSqandPHsep
1pS;Zq, the authors of [ 4] asso-
ciate an integer 'rspfq, which can be considered as the \signed genus"
betweenandfpq(see Section 3 in [ 4] for the details). They then
show that the map
'rs: PMappSqÑZ
so obtained is a well-dened, nontrivial homomorphism which depends
only on the homology class rs, see [ 4, Proposition 3.3]. Furthermore,
by [4, Proposition 4.4], this induces a surjective homomorphism
: PMappSqÑH1
seppS;Zq;
by the rule  pfqprsq'rspfq, whereH1
seppS;Zqhas been identied
with HompHsep
1pS;Zq;Zqby the Universal Coecient Theorem. Infor-
mally speaking,  pfqtells us \how much genus has been shifted" on
each end by f. It follows from (the proof of) [ 4, Theorem 5] that  is a
surjective homomorphism whose kernel is precisely PMapcpSq, namely
the closure of the compactly-supported mapping class group. At this
point, in our particular setting, one has:
Theorem 6.1 (Corollary 6 of [4]) .PMappnqPMapcpnqZn1.
When we restrict  to the pure subgroup PBn, the image of  is
generated by n1 handle shifts 1;:::;n1, which belong to PBn.SURFACE HOUGHTON GROUPS 15
Even though we do not have the semi-direct product structure in
Theorem 6.1 when restricting to PBn, the projection onto Zn1from
that theorem still denes a surjective homomorphism tting into a short
exact sequence:
1ÑpBnqcÑPBnÑZn1Ñ1;
wherepBnqcis the intersection of Bnwith PMapcpnq, which is precisely
the compactly supported elements of Bn. SincepBnqcis a direct limit of
mapping class groups of compact surfaces, Powell's result [ 29] implies
thatPpBnqab
c t0u, and therefore PBab
nZn1. At this point, the
fact that Bab
nt0ufollows from the above and the natural short exact
sequence
1ÑPBnÑBnÑSympnqÑ1;
where Sympnqis the symmetric group on nelements, and BnÑSympnq
comes from the action on the nends of  n. This is because the action
can be used to conjugate generators of PBab
nto their inverses. This
proves Theorem 1.2.
We observe that pBnqcis a normal subgroup of Bn, since the conjugate
of a compactly supported homeomorphism is compactly supported.
From the homomorphisms above, the quotient GBn{pBnqcadmits a
homomorphism to Sympnqwith kernel Zn1. It is not hard to explicitly
construct a splitting of the associated short exact sequence proving that
GZn1Sympnq. We thus have a short exact sequence
1ÑpBnqcÑBnÑpZn1SympnqqÑ 1:
On the other hand, the proof of [ 28, Theorem 4.6] of Patel and Vlamis
(which itself relies on a result of Paris [ 27]) can be applied verbatim to
show thatpBnqchas no nontrivial nite quotients, proving the following.
Proposition 6.2. Every nite quotient of Bnfactors through the ho-
momorphism to Zn1Sympnq. 
An application of this and Theorem 1.1 proves Corollary 1.3:
Proof of Corollary 1.3. First observe that if nm, then Theorem 1.1
and [ 19, Theorem 5.24] imply that the niteness properties of the groups
are dierent, and so they cannot be commensurable.
Ifnm, andBnandbrHnare commensurable, then after passing
to the intersection with the nite index pure subgroups, we nd nite
index subgroups K PBnandJ PbrHnso thatKJ. We note
here thatPbrHnis the kernel of the corresponding action on the n
(non-isolated) ends of the underlying surface, and is not the subgroup
consisting of pure braids.
Applying Proposition 6.2, we see that KabZn1, and hence
JabZn1as well. That is, both abelianizations must simply be
the restrictions of the abelianization of PBn, and thus also PbrHn,16 ARAMAYONA, BUX, KIM, AND LEININGER
respectively. The kernels of the abelianizations must therefore be nite
index subgroups of pBnqcandpbrHnqc, respectively. The former has no
nite index subgroups, whereas pbrHnqcadmits a homomorphism to
Z(being the direct limit of compactly supported braid groups), which
therefore has innitley many nontrivial nite index subgroups. This
contradiction proves that Bnand brHnare not commensurable. 
7.Marking graphs
Amarkingon a surface is a pants decomposition called the base
of the marking, basepq
ii, together with a choice of transverse
curvesifor eachi; that is, a curve iso thatipi;jq0 ifij
andipi;iq1 or 2, depending on whether iandill a one-holed
torus or four-holed sphere, respectively. Masur and Minsky [ 25] dene
a graph whose vertices are markings and so that two markings dier
byelementary moves , which essentially swaps the roles of iandi
(together with a certain \clean up" operation to ensure the result is
again a marking). Let Mndenote the marking graph of  n. The
image of a marking under a mapping class is again a marking, and the
denition of elementary move implies that the mapping class group acts
on the marking graph.
For a surface Sof nite type, its marking graph MpSqis locally nite
and the orbit map is a quasi-isometry, since the action is cocompact.
However, the action of Bnon an invariant component of Mnis not
cocompact since one can nd arbitrarily many distinct homeomorphism
types of markings. Moreover, the orbit map is not even a quasi-isometric
embedding. Indeed, if is a marking, and tiis the Dehn twist in
iPbasepq, then the distance from totipqis uniformly bounded,
while the distance from the identity to titends to innity as iÑ8
(since these are all distinct elements in a nitely generated group).
To prove Theorem 1.4, we need the following.
Lemma 7.1. For alln¥2and any marking , the stabilizer of in
Bnis either nite, or contains a nite index subgroup that acts on nby
covering transformations. In particular, the stabilizer is nite if n¥3.
Proof. There is a hyperbolic metric on  nso that all iPbasepq
have length 1 and all imeetiorthogonally. Then any element of the
stabilizer of acts on  nby isometries. The lemma now follows since the
isometry group of  nis necessarily discrete, and hence nite for n¥3,
and either nite or virtually cyclic acting by covering transformations
forn2. 
It is straightforward to construct Bn{invariant components of Mn, for
alln¥2 to which the following theorem applies, and which immediately
implies Theorem 1.4.SURFACE HOUGHTON GROUPS 17
Theorem 7.2. For anyin aBn{invariant component M0
nMnwith
nite stabilizer, there is a locally nite subgraph XM0
ncontaining
so that Bnacts properly and cocompactly on G.
Proof. We let Gbe a nite subgraph which is the union of paths con-
nectingto its image under each generator from some xed nite
generating set for Bn. Further, we assume that each vertex in Ghas
nite stabilizer as well. This is automatic for n¥3, and is easy to
arrange for n2. Now set XBnG.
The fact that Bnacts cocompactly on Xis immediate, since the
G{translates cover Xby construction. The only thing we must prove is
thatXis locally nite. For this, it suces to show that
KtgPBn|gGXG?u
is nite. Suppose there exists an innite sequence of distinct elements
tgnuK. LetxnPGbe a vertex so that yngnxnPG. There are only
nitely many vertices of G, and so after passing to a subsequence (and
reindexing), xnxandynyfor somex;yPG. Thus,g1
1gnxx
for alln, and hence the stabilizer of xis innite, a contradiction. 
Remark 7.3. The utility in proving that MappSqis quasi-isometric to
the marking graph for a nite type surface Sis that it allows one to
provide a coarse estimate for distances in terms of local information via
Masur and Minsky's subsurface projections and their distance formula
[25]. The Dehn twisting examples above imply that one cannot expect
a similar distance formula for Bn. However, one may wonder if there is
some restricted set of subsurfaces for which one can prove a distance
formula. Or perhaps there is still a distance formula for all of Mn
(which simply does not transfer to Bnbecause it is not quasi-isometric
toMn).
