The plain jet mass distributions of reconstructed jets are i nvestigated in p+p and 0-10% most
central Pb+Pb collisions at√sNN= 2.76 TeV using a dynamical multiphase transport model with
a string melting mechanism. It is observed that the mean char ged jet mass increases with increasing
jet transverse momentum and jet radius in central Pb+Pb coll isions. It is demonstrated that the
plain jet mass of reconstructed partonic jet is shifted to a h igher value after the evolution of partonic
stage due to jet quenching in central Pb+Pb collisions. Howe ver, the jet mass shift eﬀect is strongly
weakened by non-perturbative eﬀects from hadronization an d hadron rescatterings. This makes it
diﬃcult to observe signiﬁcant hot medium modiﬁcation eﬀect s on the plain jet mass distribution in
the ﬁnal state of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
I. INTRODUCTION
Jet is produced by hard quantum chromodynamics
(QCD) scatterings as a high energy parton shower with
high virtuality [ 1–3], but ﬁnally evolves into a hadron
shower due to the QCD conﬁnement dominated by non-
perturbative QCD physics [ 4]. When jet passes a hot
and dense QCD medium, it will lose energy due to jet-
medium interactions [ 5–7]. This phenomenon is named
as jet quenching [ 8–13], which makes jet as an im-
portant hard probe to detect the properties of quark-
gluon plasma (QGP) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Col-
lider (RHIC) [ 14–20] and the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) [21–24]. Both the modiﬁcation of the peaks in
two-particle azimuthal correlation [ 15,25,26] and the
suppression of nuclear modiﬁcation factor RAAof high
transverse momentum particles [ 15,27–29] are explained
asthe eﬀects ofjet quenching. Becausejet is a collimated
spray of particles with high transverse momenta, it can
be fully reconstructed based on the ﬁnal state hadrons
in the experiment. Recently, many reconstructed jet ob-
servables, e.g. dijet transverse momentum asymmetry
AJ[21,30–32], jet charge [ 33–35], jet shape [ 36–38], and
jet structures [ 39–44], have been studied to explore the
veryhotQGPmattercreatedintherelativisticheavy-ion
collisions at the LHC.
The jet mass, as another observedquantity of jet prop-
erties, has been widely studied on both experimental and
theoretical aspects [ 45–55]. The jet mass can be calcu-
lated as follows [ 47],

Foraquark-initiatedorgluon-initiatedjet, afteremitting

energy can be approximately simpliﬁed as [ 56,57],

whereziis the energy fraction of the ithgluon and θiis
the angle of the ithgluon to the initial quark or gluon
jet. Thus, the jet mass can be considered as a proto-
type of the jet shape. The two competing eﬀects in jet
quenching, jet energy loss and medium response, have
been argued to transform the jet mass distribution dif-
ferently [ 50,53,55]. According to Eq. ( 2), the jet en-
ergy loss due to jet quenching leads to a decrease of jet
mass, however, the medium response helps jet mass to
rise to a higher value because more soft particles with
largeθangles are involved in the jet cone due to jet-
medium interactions. Therefore, the jet mass with the
medium response is expected to be larger than that one
without medium response. In the recent ALICE mea-
surement [ 47], the plain charged jet mass distribution
in central Pb+Pb collisions has been observed to be in
agreement with that in p+Pb collisions within experi-
mental uncertainties, where the experimental data of jet
mass are also compared with the quenching models and
non-quenching models. The result from non-quenching
models is consistent with the experimental data in p+Pb
collisions, however, the quenching models with medium
response overestimate the mean value of plain jet mass
distribution in Pb+Pb collisions [ 47].
On the other hand, the jet mass is predicted to be sen-
sitive to both perturbative and non-perturbative QCD
eﬀect [45,46,48,49,52,54]. Forexample, the hadroniza-
tion of partons [ 58–60], as a non-perturbative eﬀect, has
been experimentally found to increase the jet mass [ 48].
Because the virtuality of the jet is calculated to associate
with the jet mass [ 49], the virtuality will be decreased
with interacting with the QGP matter. This means that2
parton interactions cause the jet mass depletion along
with jet energy loss. However, it is also argued that
therecouldbeatemporaryvirtualityincreaseinthis pro-
cess, which leads to a temporary increase of jet mass. To
distinguish between perturbative and non-perturbative
QCD eﬀects, an eﬀective way is to use jet grooming tech-
niques to focus on jet substructure [ 56,57]. For example,
the soft drop grooming can drop both soft and collinear
emissions in Lund diagram for jet shower [ 61]. There-
fore, the groomed mass is considered to be favorable to
remove the background from the underlying event and
pile up from jet showers. A hint of increased probabil-
ity to produce jets with large groomed jet mass has been
observed by the CMS Collaboration [ 62], which could
originate from medium-induced radiation at a large an-
gle from the jet axis.
In this study, we focus on diﬀerent dynamical eﬀects
on the characteristics of the ungroomed jet mass, also
known as plain jet mass, in relativistic heavy-ion colli-
sions, by using a dynamical transport model including
parton interactions, hadronization, and hadronic rescat-
terings. Please note that unless otherwise stated, the jet
mass refers to the plain jet mass in the following. We
calculate the jet mass distributions in p+p and 0-10%
most central Pb+Pb collisions at√sNN= 2.76 TeV us-
ing a multiphase transport (AMPT) model with string
melting mechanism [ 63,64], where the eﬀects of diﬀerent
dynamical evolution stages on jet mass are considered.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we brieﬂy
review the basic framework of the AMPT model with a
jet-triggering technique and introduce the method of jet
reconstruction and Bayesian unfolding technique. Com-
parisons of charged jet mass between with and without
jet quenching in most central Pb+Pb collisions is pre-
sented in Sec. IIIA. We further discuss about the eﬀects
of diﬀerent dynamical evolution stages on the jet mass
distribution in Sec. IIIB. Finally, a summary is given in
Section. IV.
II. METHODOLOGY
A. The AMPT model with triggered dijet
The AMPT model with string melting mechanism,
which is widely applied in the ﬁeld of relativistic heavy-
ioncollisions, includes fourmainstages: the initial condi-
tion generated by the heavy ion jet interaction generator
(HIJING) model [ 65,66] where the nuclear shadowingef-
fect is included via an impact-parameter-dependent but
Q2(and ﬂavor)-independent parameterization, parton in-
teractions simulated by Zhang’s parton cascade (ZPC)
model [67], hadronization performed by a simple quark
coalescence model and hadronic rescatterings described
by a relativistic transport (ART) model [ 68]. In the
string melting mechanism, all parent hadrons from the
fragmentation of minijets in hard process and excited
strings in soft process are melted into partons accord-ing to its constituted quarks, which provides us an initial
state of partonic matter. The ZPC model involves two-
body elastic scatterings among partons and the parton
cross section based on the leading order pQCD gluon-
gluoninteractionassociateswith thestrongcouplingcon-
stant and the Debye screening mass. The nearest freeze-
out partons are combined into mesons or baryons via a
simple quark coalescence model. The three-momentum
is conserved during the coalescence. The species of
formed hadrons are determined by the ﬂavor and invari-
ant mass of combined partons. The simple quark coa-
lescence model includes the formation of all mesons and
baryons listed in the HIJING program. The ﬁnal state
hadronicrescatteringsincludingelasticandinelasticscat-
terings and resonance decays are simulated by the ART
model .
To study the jet quenching eﬀect, a triggered high- pT
dijet is embedded into the initial condition using the jet-
triggering technique of the HIJING model. Several hard
QCD processes have been used to produce the initial di-
jet, which consists of g+g→g+g,g+g→q+ ¯q,
q+g→q+g,q+ ¯q→g+g,q1+q2→q1+q2,
andq1+ ¯q1→q2+ ¯q2[69]. Both initial and ﬁnal
radiations of jet showers are considered. In the string
melting mechanism, the primordial hadrons that would
be produced from the excited Lund strings, minijet and
jet partons in the HIJING model are melted into pri-
mordial quarks and antiquarks according to the ﬂavor
and spin structures of their valence quarks. Under the
above initial conditions, a partonic plasma with a di-
jet is produced. A parton cross section, 3 mb, is per-
formed to eﬀectively simulate the elastic interactions be-
tween jet shower partons and medium partons in Pb +
Pb collisions at√sNN= 2.76 TeV. Because our sim-
ulation is a full parton cascade, the elastic scatterings
between recoiled partons are included automatically. By
setting the parton interaction cross section as 0 mb, we
also can turn oﬀ both parton cascade and jet-QGP in-
teractions. The jet parton shower is converted to a jet
hadron shower through the hadronization of coalescence,
when all partons freeze out. Note that if turning oﬀ par-
ton cascade, our hadronization of coalescence is actually
as same as the hadronization of Lund string fragmenta-
tion, since the simple quark coalescence model combines
nearest partons into hadrons [ 63]. In the ﬁnal state, the
jet hadron shower loses its energy in the hadronic phase
which is simulated in the stage of hadronic rescatterings.
In principle, the parton cross section should be energy-
dependent, even with respect to the propertiesofthe sur-
rounding medium. However, our previous studies show
that the AMPT model with a proper parton cross sec-
tion has successfully described many experimental ob-
servables, including not only bulk properties [ 64,70–
72] but also reconstructed jet observables, such as γ-jet
imbalance [ 73], dijet asymmetry [ 31], jet fragmentation
function [ 40,74,75], jet shape [ 41], jet anisotropies [ 76],
jet transport coeﬃcient [ 77], and the redistribution of
lost energy [ 78,79]. Therefore, we continue to use the3
constant parton cross section in this study.
B. Jet reconstruction
To study the mass of reconstructed jets, our kine-
matic cuts are taken as same as the ALICE experi-
ment which measured the mass of the charged jets with-
out using grooming algorithms [ 47]. These track parti-
cles are required to be with the transverse momentum
ofpT,trk>0.15 GeV/ cand the pseudorapidity within
|ηtrk|<0.9. The jets are clustered with anti- kTal-
gorithm [ 80], and the background density is estimated
with the kTalgorithm in Pb+Pb collisions [ 81] using the
FastJet package [ 82]. The transverse momentum of re-
constructed jets is demanded to be larger than 60 GeV/ c
for charged jets and 100 GeV/ cfor full jets in our cal-
culations. The E-recombination scheme is performed to
reconstruct jets with three jet radii R= 0.2, 0.3, and
0.4, respectively. The jets within a pseudorapidity win-
dow of|ηjet|<0.9−Rare used to study the jet mass
distribution. Our results are speciﬁcally compared with
experimental data for jet radius R= 0.4. To remove the
jetbackgroundinPb+Pbcollisions,anarea-basedback-
ground subtraction method is used to obtain the trans-
verse momentum of background-subtracted jet [ 83],

a Bayesian unfolding procedure [ 85] in the RooUnfold
software package [ 86] is implemented to correct the jet
mass, where the response matrix is obtained by em-
bedding dijet-triggered p+p events into non-triggered
Pb+Pb events. Our results are ﬁnally obtained from the

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Charged jet mass distribution
Figure1shows the AMPT results on the distributions
of charged jet mass in three ranges of pT,ch jetin 0-10%
most central Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV with a par-
ton interaction cross-section of 0 mb (only hadronic in-
teractions) and 3 mb (both partonic and hadronic inter-
actions), in comparison with the data from the ALICE
experiment [ 47]. We notice that the chargedjet mass dis-
tributions (normalized per charged jet) from the AMPTsimulationsexhibitconsistencywithoutanyapparentdif-
ference. The jet mass peaks are also consistent with that
in p+p collisions [later shown in Figure 4(a)], which is
due to the existence of Sudakov form factor in the jet
mass distribution [ 56]. Note that the suppression eﬀect
of Sudakov double logarithms becomes increasingly im-
portant, especially near the jet mass peak, which has
driven many eﬀorts to study the higher-logarithmic re-
summation of jet mass distribution [ 51,54,87–90]. We
observe that as the transverse momentum of charged jet
increases, charged jet mass distribution becomes broader
with a gradual increase of peak position. The results
from the AMPT model overestimate the measured jet
mass distributions for 60 < pT,ch jet<80 GeV/ cand
80< pT,ch jet<100 GeV/ cin Figure 1(a) and (b), but
well describe the experimental measurement for 100 <
pT,ch jet<120 GeV/ cin Figure 1(c). We ﬁnd out that
the discrepancy between the AMPT model and the ex-
perimental data for 60 < pT,ch jet<100 GeV/ cin 0-10%
central Pb + Pb collisions actually comes from the cor-
responding discrepancy in p + p collisions. Ones could
adjust some PYTHIA parameters in HIJING part of the
AMPT model to improve the description, and we would
like to leave it as future work.
To look for any eﬀect of jet quenching on charged jet
mass distributions, Figure 2(a)-(c) presents the ratios of
charged jet mass distributions between with and without
parton interactions in three ranges of pT,ch jetin central
Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV from the AMPT model
simulations. We found that if the data points with large
errorson both edgesareignored, the ratiosare consistent
with around unity in the jet mass range of5 - 20 GeV2/c,
which means that no obvious eﬀect from jet quenching
eﬀectisobserved. Inotherwords,thejet quenchingeﬀect
due to parton interactions is so small that it is hard to
be seen in the jet mass distributions in the ﬁnal state of
central Pb+Pb collisions from our simulations.
In order to further reveal the distinctions of charged
jet mass between with and without partonic interactions,
the mean charged jet mass is calculated as a function of
pT,ch jetandR, asshownin Figure 3, where threecasesof
jet radius parameter R= 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 are compared.
It isobservedthatthe meanchargedjet massincreasesas
the jet radius Rand the jet momentum pT,ch jetincrease.
Our result is in a similar trend to the experimental data
forR= 0.4. Our result only can describe the experimen-
tal data for the hardest pT,ch jetcase, but overestimates
the other two pT,ch jetcases. On the other hand, the dif-
ference between 3 mb and 0 mb looks most obvious for
the jet with the largest jet radius Rwith the hardest
pT,ch jet, which suggests that the hard jets with large jet
cone sizes are more sensitive to the jet quenching eﬀect
than the soft jets with small jet cone sizes. These ob-
servations are also consistent with the expectation from

Relativistic heavy-ion collisions are actually a dynam-
ical evolution that includes several important evolution
stages. To characterize the medium eﬀect on jet mass, it
isessentialtocomparejetmassdistributionsfromvarious
stages of the AMPT model. We denote the four evolu-
tion stages as “initial state”, “after parton cascade”, “af-
ter hadronization”, and “after hadronic rescatterings”,
respectively. We focus on the full jets which are recon-
structed with both neutral and charged particles, in or-
der to avoid the uncertainties of the conversion between
neutral and charged particles among diﬀerent evolution
stages. Figure 4(a)-(c) present the distributions of full
jet mass ( pT,jet>100 GeV/ c) for four diﬀerent evolution
stages in p+p collisions and 0-10% most central Pb+Pb
collisions with and without parton interactions from the
AMPT simulations, respectively.
Because there should be almost no medium eﬀect on
jet mass in p+p collisions, the result from p+p colli-
sions should be a good reference. For p+p collisions
in Figure 4(a), we ﬁnd that the full jet mass distri-
bution (normalized per jet) in the initial state is basi-5

cally as same as that that after parton cascade, since
we turn oﬀ parton interactions with a zero cross section.
Whereas, the hadronization process has an obvious inﬂu-
ence on the jet mass. The jet mass distribution is shifted
to a larger value via the hadronization. This kind of
behavior that hadronization increases jet mass actually
has been observed in the recent STAR experiment [ 48]
also in PYTHIA-8 [ 91] simulations with hadronization
turned on and oﬀ. It is consistent with the expectation
from the non-perturbative eﬀect that partons are con-
ﬁned into hadrons and obtain masses via hadronization.
However,hadronicrescatteringsresultin adecreaseofjet
mass from the AMPT simulations, since both hadronic
scatterings and resonances decays can change their kine-
matics to make some hadrons out of the jet cone. The
jet mass distributions in central Pb+Pb collisions with
turning on and oﬀ parton interactions are presented in
Figure4(b) and Figure 4(c), respectively. In Figure 4(b),
the full jet mass distribution in the initial state is basi-
cally as same as that after parton cascade, which is also
similar to that observed in p+p collisions. Nevertheless,
a right shift is observed from the initial state to after
parton cascade if we turn on parton interactions in cen-
tral Pb+Pb collisions, as shown in Figure 4(c). The shift
of jet mass distribution indicates that the jet quench-
ing eﬀect in our model which includes both jet energyloss and medium response can lead to an increase of jet
mass. Itisconsistentwithourpreviousresultofjetshape
which shows more excited medium partons are involved
into the jet cone due to parton cascade, especially con-
tributing to the periphery of the jet cone [ 41]. Unfor-
tunately, the non-perturbative eﬀect from hadronization
and hadronic rescatterings weaken the right shift result-
ing from jet-medium interactions due to the same reason
in p+p collisions. This makes it diﬃcult to observe sig-
niﬁcant hot medium modiﬁcation eﬀects on the plain jet
mass distribution in the ﬁnal state of relativistic heavy-
ion collisions. Note that we apply the same pT,jetcut to
jets from diﬀerent evolution stages. However, we check
that our conclusions will not change whether we choose
the jets according to pT,jetin the initial or ﬁnal stage.
To see the nuclear modiﬁcation eﬀects on jet mass dis-
tribution in heavy-ion collisions, we show the ratio of jet
mass distribution in central Pb+Pb collisions with 0 and
3 mb to that in p+p collisions with 0 mb in Figure 5(a)
and (b), respectively. In Figure 5(a), we ﬁnd that the
ratio keeps diﬀerent from the unity from the initial state
to the ﬁnal state. This indicates that the modiﬁcation
of jet mass distribution originates from the initial state,
which may arise from the cold nuclear matter eﬀect or
diﬀerent underlying event contribution in heavy-ion col-
lisions. In Figure 5(b), we observe a strong modiﬁcation6
of jet mass distribution after parton cascade, which is
due to jet quenching in the hot QGP medium. How-
ever, the hot medium modiﬁcation eﬀect is weakened by
the following process of hadronization, which ultimately
leads to no signiﬁcant eﬀect of jet quenching in the ﬁ-
nal state. To see the diﬀerence of jet mass distributions
between with and without parton interactions at diﬀer-
ent evolution stages, the full jet mass distribution ratios
of 3 mb to 0 mb for four evolution stages in most cen-
tral Pb+Pb collisions are shown in Figure. 5(c). It can
be clearly seen that the ratio is diﬀerent from unity after
parton cascade, which indicates there is an increase of jet
mass due to jet-medium interactions in parton cascade.
However, the ratios become consistent with unity for the
two ﬁnal stages. It indicates that although the jet mass
moves towards a higher value after jet passes through
the QGPmatter, unfortunately the discrepancyresulting
from jet quenching is strongly reduced by hadronization.
Therefore, the non-perturbative eﬀects of hadronization
and hadronic rescatterings make it diﬃcult to observe
the QGP medium modiﬁcation on the plain jet mass.
To study the jet radius dependence of the modiﬁca-
tion of jet mass distribution, the ratios of full jet mass
distributions for three jet radii (R=0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) at
four evolution stages in 0-10% central Pb + Pb collisions
with 0 mb and 3 mb to that in p + p collisions with 0 mb
are shown in the top and middle panels in Figure 6. We
observe the most obvious modiﬁcation for the largest jet
radius (R= 0.6) at the initial state of central Pb + Pb
collisions, which indicates a largercold nuclearmatter ef-
fect or underlying event contribution for jets with larger
jet radii. Meanwhile, we observe that the modiﬁcation of
jet mass distribution after parton cascade increases with
increasing the jet radius in the middle panels in Figure 6.
However, these modiﬁcations are the results of the com-
binedeﬀectofcoldnucleareﬀect andjet quenchingeﬀect.
To see the pure eﬀect of jet quenching, we plot the full
jet mass distribution ratios of 3 mb to 0 mb with three
jet radii for four evolution stages in central Pb + Pb col-
lisions in the bottom panels in Figure 6. There is the
smallest eﬀect of jet quenching after the parton cascade
for the smallest jet radius ( R= 0.2). On the other hand,
the jet quenching eﬀect is found similar for the jet radii
R= 0.4 and 0.6. Unfortunately, the jet quenching eﬀect
is weakened by the process of hadronization, which even-
tually leads to no signiﬁcant eﬀect of jet quenching after
hadronic rescatterings.
Note that although only the jet elastic energy loss is
considered in our work, we expect that the qualitative
eﬀect of the dynamic evolution on the jet mass distribu-
tion will not change. In addition, we recently found that
a new hybrid hadronization mechanism with both coa-
lescence and fragmentation processes can better describe
the transverse momentum jT-dependent jet fragmenta-
tion functions in p+p and p+Pb collisions than the sim-
ple quark coalescence mechanism in the current AMPT
model [75]. Thus, it is interesting to study hadronization
eﬀectsontheplainjetmassinbothsmallandlargecollid-ing systems in the future. On the other hand, we expect
that the groomed jet mass could provide a more power-
ful probe to explore the jet quenching eﬀect [ 12,62] in
our future study, because the groomed jet mass has less
contamination from non-perturbative eﬀects [ 92,93].
On the other hand, we examine the distributions of
quark-initiated and gluon-initiated jet mass distributions
separately. We observe that the gluon-initiated jets gen-
erally have larger jet masses than quark-initiated jets
due to the larger color charge and Casimir color factor
CA> CF[94,95]. However, the pattern of changesin the
mass distribution of quark-initiated and gluon-initiated
jets is similar after each evolution stage. Finally, the
average jet mass induced by gluons is larger than the
average jet mass induced by quarks. Therefore, the aver-
age value and shape of the inclusive jet mass distribution
should also be sensitive to the ratio of quark-initiated
jets to gluon-initiated jets. This has actually attracted
a great deal of experimental eﬀort to distinguish quark-
initiated jets from gluon-initiated jets [ 96–98]. However,
this is beyond the scope of this paper, and we would like
to leave it for our future study.
IV. SUMMARY
In summary, the plain jet mass distributions of recon-
structed jets have been investigated in p+p and 0-10%
most central Pb+Pb collisions at√sNN= 2.76 TeV us-
ing a multiphase transport model with a string melting
mechanism. Our results of charged jet mass distribution
using jet radius R= 0.4 can describe the experimental
data for 100 < pT,ch jet<120 GeV/ c, but overestimate
the charged jet mass for smaller ranges of pT,ch jet. The
meanchargedjet massdepends stronglyonjet transverse
momentum and jet radius. The mean charged jet mass
is observed as an increasing function of pT,ch jetandR
in central Pb+Pb collisions. It indicates that the hard
jets with large jet cone sizes are more sensitive to the
jet quenching eﬀect than the soft jets with small jet cone
sizes.
Meanwhile, the full plainjet massdistributionsforvar-
ious dynamical evolution stages in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions have been studied in detail. In central Pb+Pb
collisions, the jet mass distribution is shifted to a higher
value by parton cascade due to the jet quenching eﬀect.
Nevertheless, the discrepancy between with and with-
out jet quenching eﬀect is strongly diminished by non-
perturbative eﬀects from hadronization and hadronic
rescatterings. The interplay of jet quenching and non-
perturbative eﬀects makes it diﬃcult to observe signiﬁ-
cant eﬀects of jet quenching on the plain jet mass dis-
tribution in the ﬁnal state of relativistic heavy-ion colli-
sions. We expect that the groomed jet mass could pro-
vide a more powerful probe to explore the jet quenching
eﬀect in our future study, because the groomed jet mass
has less contamination from non-perturbative eﬀects.7
