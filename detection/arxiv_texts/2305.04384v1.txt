Abstract  
Creating single photons in the telecommunication wavelength range from semiconductor 
quantum dots (QDs)  and i nterfacing  them with  spins of electrons or holes has been of high 
interest in recent years, with research mainly focusing on indium based QDs. However, there 
is not much data on the optical and spin properties of galliumantimonide ( GaSb ) QDs, despite 
it being a physically rich system w ith a n indirect to direct bandgap crossover in the telecom 
wavelength range. Here, we investigate the (quantum -) optical properties of GaSb quantum 
dots , which are fabricated by filling droplet -etched nanoholes in an aluminum -
galliumantimonide ( AlGaSb ) mat rix. We observe  photoluminescence  (PL) features  from 
isolated and highly symmetric QDs  that exhibit  narrow linewidth in the telecom S -band  and 
show an excitonic fine structure splitting of ∆𝐸𝐹𝑆𝑆=(12.0±0.5) μ𝑒𝑉. Moreover,  we 
perform time -resolved measurements of the decay characteristics of a n exciton and measure 
the second -order photon autocorrelation function of the charge complex  to g2(0)=0.16±
0.02, revealing clear antibunching and thus proving the capability of this material platform to 
generate non -classical light .  
 
1. Introduction  
 
Non -classical light sources are a major building block in quantum communication applications 
as well as for photonic quantum computing. Emis sion wavelengths tailored to the 
telecommunication range are of particular  interest since they  offer the least absorption and 
wave packet dispersion of photons  in optical fibers[1]. This aspect is crucial for exploiting 
existing fiber networks by implement ing protocols  for secure long -range communication , as 
has been shown for several hundred kilometers of optical fiber[2]. Among several other 
physical systems like vacancy  centers in diamond[3] and trapped  atoms[4] , semiconductor

 quantum dots (QDs) of fer superior  optical properties  like high single photon purity and 
indistinguishability [5]–[9]. Over the last few years, several QD  material platforms like 
indium(gallium)arsenide ( In(Ga)As )/ galliumarsenide ( GaAs ) and indiumarsenide ( InAs )/ 
indiumphosphide ( InP)[10] have emerged as resources for non -classical light and spin -photon 
interfaces in the telecom wavelength range , demonstrating a first two -photon interference 
experiment over a 2 km fiber channel[11]. This show s the possibility of the platform to scale to 
measurement device independent quantum key distribution (MDI -QKD) and to extend to 
quantum repeaters . Especially, the use of a metamorphic buffer (MMB) layer can be utilized 
to shift the emission of I nAs quantum dots ,  which are well understood spin -photon 
interfaces[12] with outstanding performance in the NI R wavelength range around 900  nm, into 
the telecom range and to create polarization -entangled photons[13]. First attempts to increase 
collection efficiency by integrating telecom InAs QDs into photonic structures in free 
space[14],[15] as well as fiber -coupled[16] have been demons trated , and first steps into plug&play 
devices for quantum key distribution (QKD) in the telecom O -band have been realized[17]. 
While all these approaches cover the need for low losses on the photonic side, the other 
pressing requirement for memory -based quantum repeaters  is control over  the matter qubit, 
which is  the spin  in a quantum dot . In previous wor ks on InAs/GaAs QDs , we  have shown the 
demonstration of full coherent control of a spin -qubit emitting in the telecom C -band[18]. 
However , the spin coherence times were very short ( T2* = 240  ps [18]), limiting the useability 
of the system when approaching  implementation of the QDs in qu antum repeater applications . 
The times to which the coherence of an optically active spin -qubit can be extended (e.g. 
through dynamical decoupling techniques) are, amongst others, governed by the nuclear 
spins[19]. In this  indium plays a dominant role  as was experimentally shown in recent years[20], 
as it has a large nuclear spin of 𝑠𝑁,𝐼𝑛=9
2 (In comparis on: 𝑠𝑁,𝐴𝑠=3
2, 𝑠𝑁,𝐺𝑎=3
2, 𝑠𝑁,𝑆𝑏=5
2). An 
example of an indium -free material platform is GaAs  QDs, grown by droplet etching epitaxy  
on aluminum -gallium - arsenide ( AlGaAs ), which has been shown to be a source of non -classical 
light of high quality[21] in the wavelength range of 780 nm . Using GaAs QDs and exploiting 
decoupling techniques, recent work could extend electron spin coherence times into the 
millisecond range[22]. Indium -free QDs are thus very promisi ng to extend the coherence times 
of semiconductor QDs, but the GaAs material system is limited to the short wavelength range. 
GaSb QDs are a promising indium -free QD candidate to make comparably long coherence 
times also available in the telecom wavelength  range.   
In this work, we investigate the unexplored quantum -optical properties of GaSb quantum dots, 
grown by local droplet etching of nanoholes and subsequent filling . We  show first results of 
time -resolved  as well as autocorrelation measurements of emi ssion features from single GaSb 
QDs emitting in the telecom S -band. Our results pave the way to exploit this material platform , 
that combines the low losses of photons in the telecom range with possibly long spin 
coherence times due to the lack of indium.

2. Sample Design  and Heterostructure Growth  
 
The GaSb QDs investigated in this study were grown by solid -source molecular beam epitaxy 
(MBE) on GaSb(100) substrates by GaSb filling of nanoholes etched into AlGaSb via local 
droplet etching[23]. This method was first developed for the GaAs/AlGaAs system[24],[25] and 
has been recently extended to the GaSb/AlGaSb system  (see previously published 
articles[26],[27], including more details on the growth of our sample).  
The exact heterostructure is provided in Figure 1 (a). After oxide desorption, the growth 
process is started by depositing a 100  nm thick GaSb buffer followed by 50 nm of 
aluminarsenideantimonide  (AlAsSb) and 100  nm  of aluminumgalliumantimonide 
(Al0.3Ga0.7Sb). The local droplet etching is initiated by depositing 1.5 monolayers (MLs) of Al 
with a 0.3 ML/s flux at a temperature 395 °C under a low Sb -flux of 0.07 ML/s.  The excess Al 
forms a uniform distribution of metal droplets on the surface with a density of 
2.6×107 𝑐𝑚−2, which then etch into the underlying Al0.3Ga0.7Sb matrix forming ~12 nm 
deep nanoholes[27]. The nanoholes are subsequently filled by GaSb and then encapsulated by 
Al0.3Ga0.7Sb. In this study , a thickness of the GaSb -filling layer  of 20 ML was  used.  To promote 
carrier capture into the QDs, the Al0.3Ga0.7Sb /GaSb -QD/ Al0.3Ga0.7Sb structure was also 
encased with AlAs 0.08Sb0.92. The topmost AlAs 0.08Sb0.92 is protected from atmospheric oxid ation 
by a thin 15 nm GaSb capping layer.  For more efficient collection of the emitted PL, a solid

substrate and buffer is used, followed by 50 nm of AlAsSb. The droplets are etching holes  into a 
100  nm layer of Al 0.3Ga 0.7Sb which are  then filled with GaSb, followed by an Al 0.3Ga 0.7Sb layer of 
identical thickness as the first. The layer structure ends with 50 𝑛𝑚 of AlAsSb and a 15 nm GaSb cap.

 immersion lens (SIL) was placed over the whole sample , as can be seen in the  artistic drawing 
of our sample in Figure 1 ( b). 
 
3. Experimental Data and Discussion  
 
3.1 Setup and Methods  
The sample was mounted in a closed -cycle cryostat , which allows for keeping a stable position 
for up to several weeks while keeping the sample at a base temperature of T=1.57 K .  For 
excitation, a  fiber coupled continuous -wave laser with a wavelength of 940  nm was used 
(further  called cw -laser)  as well as a ps pulsed optical parametric oscillator ( OPO ) with 
identical wavelength as laser the cw -laser  and a repetition rate of 80 MHz  (further called 
pulsed laser) . 
In the detec tion path, polarization optics (quarter -wave plate, half -wave plate, and linear 
polarizer, further called QWP, HWP, and LP) were installed , to perform polarization -resolved 
PL-measurements. The QD signal was then fiber coupled and analyzed in a 750 mm Czerny -
Turner spectrometer for its spectral components and detected with a n indiumgalliumarsenide  
(InGaAs )-camera. A fiber -coupled variable bandpass filter was used to isolate single  emission 
lines from individual charge complexes for further analys is. To resolve the signal temporally, 
the filtered signal was redirected onto superconducting nanowire single photon detectors 
(SNSPDs ), connected to correlation electronics , which can be triggered by the laser.  
 
3.2. μ-PL Spectra and Characterization  
The fundamental optical properties of individual GaSb QDs are studied by means of micro 
photoluminescence ( μ-PL). The average QD density of 2.6×107 cm-2 ensures that individual 
QDs can be addressed and excited. In agreement with earlier reports[27], we could observe PL-
emission in the telecom S -band around 1470 nm .  
Figure 2 (a)  depicts a spectrum  that was  obtained by exciting the QD with a wavelength of 
940  nm, an excitation power of 𝑃=1.89 μ W and an integrati on time of  100  s. The most 
prominent emission feature  (referred to as main peak  from now on), is located at 
approximately 1469.2 nm  and highlighted by the red background in the spectrum. 
Surrounding it are  various other discrete recombination features at higher wavelengths. These 
characteristics look similar to the PL from GaAs QDs, grown via droplet etching, under non -
resonant excitation[28]. To analyze the underlying dynamics between the emission features 
and to identify the nature of the studie d charge complex, we performed a power series. For 
this, we increased the laser pump -power from 0.27 μ W to 3.84 μ W and measured the PL 
emission spectra. E very thus acquired spectrum  was fitted  with a Lorentzian multipeak fit  to 
track the evolution of the p eaks. The inset in the upper right corner of Figure 2 (a) depicts the 
integrated intensity  of the main peak , extracted from the fit s, as a function of  the excitation 
power on the  double -logarithmic scale. A linear fit to the logarithmic axes yields a power -law 
coefficient of 1.03, pointing towards emission from a neutral exciton or a trion. For  𝑃>
2.5 μW, the main peak PL-intensity saturate s.   
5 
  
Further information about the nature of the observed charge complexes was gathered by 
performing a polarization series . A structural asymmetry of the QD leads to a mixing of the 
spin states of the exciton and results in a fine -structure splitting (FSS)[29], while  a trion on the

background in the plot. The g reen dashed lines indicate the wavelength range resolved in (b). 
(Inset)  Peak intensity of the main peak, vs. excitation power. Plotted on the double logarithmic

The PL intensity saturates  for powers >2.5 μW. (b) False color plot of the normalized PL -
spectra of a polarization series with the y -axis displaying the rotation of the HWP from 0° to 
180° . A slight oscillation of the main peak s center wavelength posi tion with the HWP rotation 
angle is visible, which is further quantified in (c). Here, the position of the main peak is 
extracted from a series of fits and plotted versus the HWP rotation. A sinusoidal fit to the data 
yields a fine structure splitting of  ∆𝜆𝐹𝑆𝑆=(0.021 ±0.001 ) nm or ∆𝐸𝐹𝑆𝑆=(12.0±0.5) μ𝑒𝑉  
respectively. The data displayed in this figure suggest, that the investigated charge complex is 
an exciton with small FSS.

 other hand would not show any dependency on the polarization angle[29]. For  this 
measurement, we placed a HWP in front of a LP in the det ection path  and rotated it from 0 ° 
to 180 ° , to measure the polarization -dependent spectra  in all rectilinear projections.  The 
normalized spectra  are displayed in Figure 2 (b)  as a function of wavelength and HWP rotation 
angle in a colored contour plot . The main peak displays a subtle, visible oscillation  with the 
rotation angle  that can be further quantified by fitting the series, as is depicted in Figure 2 (c). 
A sinusoidal fit to the peak position versus the rotation angle yields a splitting amplitude of  
∆𝜆𝐹𝑆𝑆 =(0.021 ±0.001 ) nm corresponding to  ∆𝐸𝐹𝑆𝑆 =(12.0±0.5) μ𝑒𝑉 respectively . Together 
with the above analyzed power dependency of the peak intensity this suggests that the 
investigated charge complex is an exciton with a small fine structure splitting (FSS), which can 
be attributed to the slight  asymmetry  of the QDs.   
 
 
3.3. Quantum -Optical Properties  
To investigate the quantum -optical properties of the identified exciton , we performed a series 
of time -resolved measurements. We filtered  the spectral line of the main peak using a variable 
bandpass filter and measured with a temporal resolution  of about 20 ps  using  SNSPDs and 
correlation electronics . 
 
 
3.3.1. Time resolved photoluminescence  
By analyzing  the temporal evolution of the PL -intensity measured on the SNSPDs, insight can 
be gained into the fundamental dynamics of charge carriers in our sample.  For this, t he pulsed 
laser  was synchronizing  the correlation electronics  and a n excitation wavelength of 940 nm . A 
pulse duration of ~2 ps  were  used to excite the QD. Figure 3 ( a) displays the time resolved PL 
data, with the spectrally resolved filtered main peak as an inset in the upper right corner. One 
can see clearly  that there is a filling process of significant time.  
Under above -band gap excitation , multiple charge injection and decay channels are bound to 
contribute to the observed temporal signature, forming a complex system of coupled and time 
dependent populations.  To account for this theoretica lly, w e assume the model  that is  
illustrated in Figure 3 ( b), where at a time 𝑡0 after the laser pulse  there are three  reservoirs  
(QD, QW Γ-valley and QW 𝐿-valley  ) with three initial populations (𝑥0,𝐺0 and 𝐿0) and time 
dependent evolutions ( 𝑋(𝑡),𝐺(𝑡) and 𝐿(𝑡)) respectively.  The 𝐿-valley  of the QW has a higher 
density of states and its feeding into the Γ-valley can be seen in independent measurements  
of the QW emission  (not shown here) . Equation (1) formulates the set of coupled differ ential 
equations which we use  to describe the dynamics in this system : 
 
{ 𝑋̇(𝑡)=−𝑎 𝑋(𝑡)+𝑏 𝐺(𝑡)
𝐺̇(𝑡)=−(𝑏+𝑐) 𝐺(𝑡)+𝑑 𝐿(𝑡),
𝐿̇(𝑡)=−𝑑 𝐿(𝑡)   {   𝑋(0)=𝑥0
 𝐺(0)=𝐺0
𝐿(0)=𝐿0 .    (1) 
   
7 
 The temporal evolution of the QD charge carrier population is governed by the decay rate 
"𝑎" of excitons and the filling rate "𝑏"  from the QW Γ-valley.  Meanwhile, the population in  
the Γ-valley is diminished through this decay to the QD, but also through radiative decay 
directly to the ground state with rate "𝑐". The QW 𝐿-valley  fills the Γ-valley with a rate  "𝑑". 
Considering the above given  rate equations, the experimentally acquired data can  be 
described by the time dependent evolution 𝑋(𝑡). The set of differential equations is therefore 
solved (cf. supplementary material , equation S1 ) and  fitted to the data as a solid red line in 
Figure 3 ( a). Since our rate equation starts with a given fi lling at time zero and not with a 
temporal finite excitation pulse,  an error function with width σ is multiplied to 𝑋(𝑡). Our true 
zero where the QD is filled and starts to decay is at about 1 ns in Figure 3 (b).  From the fitted 
parameter "𝑎" , the radi ative lifetime T1X=(431 ±10) ps can be inferred . A simple 
exponential fit, which would not follow our rate equation, would give  a lifetime of (930 ±
9) ps, when fitting only times larger 𝑡>4 ns.  
From the rate equation, t he decay time of the quantum well to the quantum dot can be 
determined to 4.35 ns and is therefore the dominating process for the overall shape of the 
time trace.  Whether the filling rates from this model with many free parameters are actually 
reflecting the reality should be checked in future independent measurements of the QW 
decay.  
Figure 3.  Temporal evolution of charge injection into and decay of excitons in the QD.  (a) Time resolved 
PL-intensity of the filtered emission line, which is displayed in the upper right inset ( 10 s integration 
time, on spectrometer). The data is fitted with the function 𝑋(𝑡) as described in Equation (S1).  From 
the fit  (solid red line) , the QD radiative lifetime can be determined to 𝑇1𝑋=(431 ±10) ps. The overall 
shape of the time trace is dominated by the long decay time of 4.35 𝑛𝑠 from the QW to the QD.  
(b) Theoretical model of the contributing processes. Rates , that must be considered for solving the 
differential equation describing the observed time trace , are: (i.) radiative decay of charge carriers in 
the QD excited state to the QD ground state, (ii.) fil ling of the QD through relaxation from the QW 𝛤-
valley , (iii.) direct radiative decay from the QW 𝛤-valley  to the ground state, and (iv.) scattering from 
the QW 𝐿-valley   to the 𝛤-valley . Together with initial populations for QD, 𝛤-valley  and 𝐿-valley  , 
these rates form the system of coupled differential equations described in Equation (1).   
 
  
8 
 Our time resolved investigations of the excitonic emission line show that under above -
band gap excitation of a reservoir of charge carriers, the complex filling processes from the 𝐿- 
and Γ-valley of the QW to the quantum dot play a predominant role. While these dynamics are 
of fundamental interest, they also show the need to excite the QDs resonantly in further 
experiments, as this will eliminate the filling through the QW.  Under resonant pumping, an 
exponential fit of the time trace of the exciton  would  directly yield its radiative lifetime . 
Furthermore, delayed re -excitation during one laser pulse  from a reservoir could be avoided, 
which strongly affects the single photon characteristics as we show in the  following paragraph . 
 
 
3.3.1. Second Order Autocorrelation Measurement  
To evaluate how well single photons, originating  from the discrete energy levels inside the QD , 
can be separated from any unwanted multiphoton background , we performed second order  
photon  autocorrelation measurements . The same excitation conditions as for the 
measurement  of the excitonic time trace were used.  In this case, however, the signal was 
channeled through a 50:50 fiber beam -splitter onto two different channels of the single 
photon  detectors  that were  connected to the correlation electronics . The correlation 
electronics were  not synchronized to the laser any longer but  operated in a “start/stop” 
manner, where one of the SNSPDs start ed the correlation measurement, while the other 
stop ped it. 
Figure 4  displays  the autocorrelation measurement as  a histogram of background corrected 
coincidences versus time delays ∆𝑡 between detection events on the two detectors.  The 
autocorrelation measur ement , which is an approximation to the second order correlation 
function g(2)(Δt), shows a clear antibunching behavior of photons around zero time delay. To 
quantify the  value of g(2) at zero time delay , the counts  accumulated in  the zero  peak  are 
normalized on the average of the accumulated counts in each side peak. The coincidence 
window, i.e., the width of the integration, is set arbitrarily such that most of the counts are 
included, which in our case results in  8 𝑛𝑠. This yields a  value gcorrected(2)(0) = 0.16±0.02, 
which is about half the value from the raw data ( graw(2)(0)=0.32±0.01). However, we want 
to describe the source as precisely  as possible,  and o ur detectors have a significant dark count 
rate compared to the rate of detected pho tons . Thus, we believe the background corrected 
value, where  the background  is calculated from independently measured dark -/ signal count 
rates  reflects the source properties better.  Details on the calculation  of the background level 
as well as the  data without background correction  (Figure S1) can be found in the 
supplemental information .   
9 
  
The inset in the upper right corner of Figure 4 zooms into the central peak, displaying an 
additional dip in the coincidence counts at ∆𝑡=0 that reaches down nea r zero counts. We 
believe that the counts close to zero time delay accumulated in the central peak, which 
contribute mainly to the non -zero g2(0) value, are a direct result of the refilling from the QW, 
as explained in the lifetime measurement  (see section  3.3.1).  This leads to multiple  excitation s 
during one laser pulse . While this increases the number of photons contaminating the single -
photon characteristics of our  non-resonantly excited  source, it demonstrates  the high  
potential of GaSb QDs to be good  single photon sources when  exciting the QD resonantly.  
 
4.  Conclusion  
 
We have investigated the characteristics of narrow -linewidth PL -features from GaSb QDs, 
analyzing time resolved PL and the second order correlation function of a stream of photons  
from  an exciton  that are the first measurements of their kind on this material platform.   
Exciting above -bandgap, t he fine structure splitting of the exciton could be determined to 
∆𝐸𝐹𝑆𝑆 =(12.0±0.5) μ𝑒𝑉. Moreover, t he time -resolved signature  of the exciton  recombination 
photons  reveals a slow rise of the PL intensity after excitation . This slow rise  points towards 
the existence of multiple charge injection channels.  By solving a system of three coupled 
differential equations, we have been able to fit the data , extracting the radiative lifetime of 
the exciton to be 𝑇1𝑋=(431 ±10) ps. The complex filling mechanism s from the QW Γ- and

than for non -zero delay times. Comparing the averaged integrated cou nts of peaks for 𝑡>0 s with the 
peak at 𝑡0=0 s using equal integration widths of 8 ns, one can derive a g2(0) value of 0.16±0.02.

 𝐿 -valley when  exciting above bandgap also reflect in the autocorrelation measurement , 
where double excitation s during one laser pulse could be observed.  
Nevertheless, we  have been able to prove  the non-classical nature of the PL  of the investigated 
charge complex by measuring a g(2)(0) value of  0.16±0.02. A drop of correlated count -
events a t zero delay time suggests that GaSb  QDs have  a high potential to be good sources of  
single photon s under resonant pumping .

Raw data of autocorrelation measurement without background correction  
Without taking into account  the constant, purely statistical contribution of dark counts on the 
detectors, the histogram of the of the coincidence counts is added with a constant offset, as 
can be seen in Figure S1. Calculating g(2)(0) with the same intervals as in the main text yield s 
a value of 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑤(2)(0)=0.32±0.01, which is still significantly below 0.5. 
Background correction:  
To take the statistical contribution of dark counts into account, we measured the dark count 
rate 𝑟1,(2)−dark of our detector system for 10 s and calculated  the expected background 
contribution together with the measured rate at each detector ( 𝑟1,𝑟2) as: 
 
counts 𝐵𝐺=(𝑟1⋅𝑟2−dark +𝑟2⋅𝑟1−dark)⋅𝑡,  
 
where 𝑡 is the total measurement time.  
 
Figure S 1.  Autocorrelation measurement without background subtraction.  The uncorrected g(2)(0) 
value  is 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑤(2)(0)=0.32±0.01.

 Solution of the system of three coupled differential rate equations  
The system of coupled differential rate equations as described in Equation (1) can be solved 
to the individual components 𝑋(𝑡),𝐺(𝑡) and 𝐿(𝑡). The solution for 𝑋(𝑡), which corresponds 
to the observable QD radiative decay, is:  
𝑋(𝑡)=𝑒−𝑐 𝑡−𝑏 𝑡−𝑎 𝑡 (𝑒𝑐 𝑡+𝑏 𝑡 (((𝑐+𝑏−𝑎) 𝑑−𝑎 𝑐−𝑎 𝑏+𝑎2) 𝑥0+𝑏 𝑑 𝐿0+(𝑏 𝑑−𝑎 𝑏)  𝐺0)
(𝑐+𝑏−𝑎) 𝑑−𝑎 𝑐−𝑎 𝑏+𝑎2 −
(𝑏 𝑑 𝐿0+(𝑏 𝑑−𝑏 𝑐−𝑏2)  𝐺0) 𝑒𝑎 𝑡
(𝑐+𝑏−𝑎) 𝑑−𝑐2+(𝑎−2 𝑏) 𝑐−𝑏2+𝑎 𝑏) +𝑏 𝑑  𝐿0
(𝑑2+(−𝑐−𝑏−𝑎) 𝑑+𝑎 𝑐+𝑎 𝑏) 𝑒𝑑 𝑡 .                     (Equati on S1)  
           
This function was fitted to the dataset that is illustrated in Figure 3 (b) of section  3.3.1.
