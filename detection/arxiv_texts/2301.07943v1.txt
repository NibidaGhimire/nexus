Abstract. We prove some results on weakly almostsquare Banach spaces a nd
their relatives. On the one hand, we discuss weak almost squa reness in the
setting of Banach function spaces. More precisely, let (Ω ,Σ) be a measurable
space, let Ebe a Banach lattice and let ν: Σ→E+be a non-atomic countably
additive measure having relatively norm compact range. The n the space L1(ν)
is weakly almost square. This result applies to some abstrac t Ces` aro function
spaces. Similar arguments show that the Lebesgue-Bochner s paceL1(µ,Y) is
weakly almost square for any Banach space Yand for any non-atomic ﬁnite
measure µ. On the other hand, we make some progress on the open question
of whether there exists a locally almost square Banach space which fails the
diameter two property. In this line we prove that if Xis any Banach space
containing a complemented isomorphic copy of c0, then for every 0 < ε <1
there exists an equivalent norm |·|onXsatisfying: (i) every slice of the unit
ballB(X,|·|)has diameter 2; (ii) B(X,|·|)contains non-empty relatively weakly
open subsets of arbitrarily small diameter; and (iii) ( X,|·|) is (r,s)-SQ for all
0< r,s <1−ε
1+ε.
1.Introduction
Let (X,/bardbl·/bardbl) be a Banach space. The (closed) unit ball and the unit sphere of X
are denoted by B(X,/bardbl·/bardbl)andS(X,/bardbl·/bardbl), respectively. If the norm does not need to
be explicitly mentioned, we just write BXandSXinstead. Given a bounded set
C⊆X, asliceofCis a set of the form
S(C,x∗,α) :={x∈C:x∗(x)>supx∗(C)−α}
for some x∗∈X∗(the topological dual of X) andα >0. Notice that S(C,x∗,α)
is non-empty and relatively weakly open in C. A Banach space is said to have
theslice diameter two property (slice-D2P) (respectively, diameter two property
– D2P, strong diameter two property – SD2P ) if every slice (respectively, non-
empty relatively weakly open subset, convex combination of slices) o f the unit ball
has diameter 2. Diameter two properties have attracted the atte ntion of many
researchers in the last 20 years (see, e.g., [1, 3, 10, 11, 26]) and h ave motivated the

appearance of new properties of Banach spaces (almost squaren ess [2], symmetric
strong diameter two properties [25, 34] or diametral diameter two properties [14]).
According to Abrahamsen, Langemets and Lima [2], a Banach space ( X,/bardbl·/bardbl) is
said to be
(i)locally almost square (LASQ) ifforevery x∈S(X,/bardbl·/bardbl)thereexistsasequence
(yn)n∈NinB(X,/bardbl·/bardbl)such that /bardblx±yn/bardbl →1 and/bardblyn/bardbl →1;
(ii)weakly almost square (WASQ) if for every x∈S(X,/bardbl·/bardbl)there exists a weakly
null sequence ( yn)n∈NinB(X,/bardbl·/bardbl)such that /bardblx±yn/bardbl →1 and/bardblyn/bardbl →1;
(iii)almost square (ASQ) if for every ﬁnite set {x1,...,x k} ⊆S(X,/bardbl·/bardbl)there
exists a sequence ( yn)n∈NinB(X,/bardbl·/bardbl)such that /bardblxi±yn/bardbl →1 for every
i∈ {1,...,k}and/bardblyn/bardbl →1.
All these properties are isometric in nature, i.e., they depend on the norm consid-
ered. For instance, the basic example of an ASQ space is c0with its usual norm,
while every Banach space admits an equivalent norm failing the slice-D2 P and so
it cannot be LASQ (see, e.g., [13, Lemma 2.1]).
Even though the previous properties were introduced in [2], LASQ a nd WASQ
spaceswereimplicitlyusedbyKubiak[31]tostudytheD2PinsomeCes` arofunction
spaces. Apart from being interesting by themselves, almost squar eness properties
have shown to be a powerful tool in order to study diameter two pr operties in
certain Banach spaces where there is not a good description of the dual space. In
this direction let us mention, for instance, that in [28, Section 4] it is p roved that if
XisLASQ(resp., ASQ)thenanyultrapower XUofXisLASQ(resp., ASQ)and, in
particular, XUhas the slice-D2P (resp., SD2P). Observe that it is unclear whether
XUhas the slice-D2P (resp., SD2P) if Xhas the slice-D2P (resp., SD2P). Another
context in which these properties are useful are the projective s ymmetric tensor
products. It is known that if Xis WASQ and has the Dunford-Pettis property
(resp.,Xis ASQ) then all the projective symmetric tensor products /hatwide⊗π,s,NXhave
the slice-D2P[33, Proposition3.6](resp., SD2P[12, Theorem3.3]). No tice that it is
unknown whether any of the diameter two properties is stable by ta king projective
symmetric tensor products.
Among all the almost squareness properties introduced in [2], it is clea r that
ASQ has been studied in a more intensive way because it turns out to c haracterise
the containment of c0. More precisely, a Banach space admits an ASQ equivalent
renorming if, and only if, it contains an isomorphic copy of c0(see [2, Lemma 2.6]
and [12, Theorem 2.3]). The contribution to examples of LASQ and WAS Q spaces
has been more modest. In spite of that, we ﬁnd several results in t he literature
about these properties in the context of function spaces. On the one hand, Kubiak
proved in [31, Lemma 3.3] that the weighted Ces` aro function space s on an interval
are WASQ. In particular, L1[0,1] is WASQ. On the other hand, Hardtke proved
in [27, Theorem 3.1] that the K¨ othe-Bochner space E(X) is LASQ whenever the
Banach space Xis LASQ, for any Banach function space E.
The aim ofthis note is to deepen the understandingofWASQ and LASQ Banach
spaces. The paper is organized as follows.ON WEAKLY ALMOST SQUARE BANACH SPACES 3
In Section 2 we focus on certain Banachfunction spaceswhich play a n important
role in Banach lattice and operator theory. Namely, we consider the spaceL1(ν)
of all real-valued functions that are integrable with respect to a co untably additive
vector measure ν(deﬁned on a σ-algebra and taking values in a Banach space). Up
to Banach lattice isometries, these spaces represent all order co ntinuous Banach
lattices having a weak order unit (see, e.g., [17, Theorem 8]). There fore, there are
reﬂexive (hence, having the Radon-Nikod´ ym property and so failin g the slice-D2P)
Banach lattices within this class, like ℓpandLp[0,1] for 1< p <∞. For detailed
information on the L1space of a vector measure, see [38]. More recent references
on this topic are [15, 19, 20, 37, 39]. Our main result in this section is th e following:
Theorem 1.1. Let(Ω,Σ)be a measurable space, let Ebe a Banach lattice and let
ν: Σ→Ebe a countably additive measure. If νis non-atomic and the set
R(ν) :={ν(A) :A∈Σ}
(the range of ν) is a relatively norm compact subset of E+:={x∈E:x≥0},
thenL1(ν)is WASQ.
Clearly, Theorem 1.1 generalizes the fact that the classical space L1(µ) of a
non-atomic ﬁnite measure µis WASQ. As an application of Theorem 1.1 and some
results of Curbera and Ricker [18], it follows that if Eis an order continuous
rearrangement invariant Banach function space on [0 ,1], then the abstract Ces` aro
function space [ C,E] is WASQ (Corollary 2.3). This generalizes the aforementioned
result by Kubiak in the case of the interval [0 ,1]. Abstract Ces` aro function spaces
have been widely studied in the literature (see, e.g., [6, 7, 18]).
The techniques of Theorem 1.1 allow us to show the Lebesgue-Bochn er space
L1(µ,Y) is WASQ for any Banach space Ywhenever µis a non-atomic ﬁnite
measure (Corollary 2.5). This result should be compared with the abo ve mentioned
result of [27] that the property of being LASQ passes from a Banac h spaceYto the
K¨ othe-Bochner space E(Y), for any Banach function space E. We ﬁnish Section 2
with an example of a WASQ Banach space of the form L1(ν) as in Theorem 1.1
which is not an L1-space (Subsection 2.3).
In Section 3 we go a bit further in the analysis of the link between almos t square-
nessand diameter two properties. One of the main questions raised in [2] is whether
there exists a LASQ Banach space which is not WASQ. Very recently, Kaasik and
Veeorgprovedin [29, Section2]that the answerisnegativeandtha t anexamplecan
be found in the class of Lipschitz-free spaces over complete metric spaces. For such
spaces, the properties SD2P, D2P, slice-D2P and LASQ are equivale nt (combine
[9, Theorem 1.5] and [24, Theorem 3.1]), so the above mentioned exam ple satisﬁes
the SD2P. Since the slice-D2P and the D2P are diﬀerent properties [1 0], it is a
natural question whether there exists a LASQ Banach space which fails the D2P.
Within the framework of Banach lattices, a stronger version of the LASQ property
which implies the D2P has been considered in [16]. Even though we do not know
the answer to the previous question, we make some progress in this direction. Our
main result in Section 3 is the following:4 J. RODR ´IGUEZ AND A. RUEDA ZOCA
Theorem 1.2. LetXbe a Banach space containing a complemented isomorphic
copy ofc0. Then for any 0< ε <1there exists an equivalent norm |·|onXsuch
that:
(i) (X,|·|)has the slice-D2P, that is, every slice of B(X,|·|)has diameter 2.
(ii)There are non-empty relatively weakly open subsets of B(X,|·|)of arbitrarily
small diameter.
(iii) (X,|·|)is(r,s)-SQ for all 0< r,s <1−ε
1+εin the sense of [8, Section 6] , that
is, for every ﬁnite set {x1,...,x n} ⊆SXthere exists y∈SXsatisfying
|rxi±sy| ≤1for every i∈ {1,...,n}.
Condition (iii) measures somehow how far is the norm from being ASQ. N otice
that a Banach space is ASQ if and only if it is ( r,s)-SQ for all 0 < r,s <1.
Theorem 1.2 applies to any separable Banach space containing an isom orphic
copy ofc0, thanks to Sobczyk’s theorem. The proof of Theorem 1.2 is inspired by
the renorming technique developed by Becerra Guerrero, L´ opez -Perez and Rueda
Zocain [10, Theorem2.4], which in turn uses ideas of the example ofArg yros, Odell
and Rosenthal [5] of a closed bounded convex subset of c0having the convex point
of continuity property but failing the point of continuity property.
Terminology. We follow standard notation as can be found in [4, 23]. We will
consider real Banach spaces only. By an operator we mean a continuous linear map
between Banach spaces. By a subspace of a Banach space we mean a norm closed
linear subspace. Let ( X,/bardbl·/bardbl) be a Banach space. Given a set C⊆X, we denote by
conv(C) (resp., conv(C)) its convex hull (resp., closed convex hull). The diameter
ofCis deﬁned by diam /bardbl·/bardbl(C) := sup{/bardblx−x′/bardbl:x,x′∈C}and will be also denoted
by diam( C) if no confusion arises.
Let (Ω,Σ,µ) be a ﬁnite measure space. A Banach space ( E,/bardbl·/bardbl) is said to be a
Banach function space on (Ω,Σ,µ) (or just over µ) if the following conditions hold:
(i)Eis a (not necessarily closed) linear subspace of L1(µ);
(ii) iff∈L0(µ) and|f| ≤ |g|µ-a.e. forsome g∈E, thenf∈Eand/bardblf/bardbl ≤ /bardblg/bardbl;
(iii) the characteristic function χAof eachA∈Σ belongs to E.
In this case, Eis a Banach lattice when endowed with the µ-a.e. order and the
inclusion map from EtoL1(µ) is an operator. A set H⊆Eis called uniformly µ-
integrable if for each ε >0 there is δ >0 such that /bardblfχA/bardbl ≤εfor every f∈Hand
for every A∈Σ withµ(A)≤δ. Suppose now that Eis order continuous. Then
every bounded uniformly µ-integrable subset of Eis relatively weakly compact
(see, e.g., [38, Proposition 2.39]), but the converse might fail, in cons trast to the
case of the classical L1space of a ﬁnite measure (for which the Dunford-Pettis
theorem ensures the equivalence). Moreover, given f,g∈Ewithf≤g, the order
interval[ f,g]⊆Eis uniformly µ-integrable(see, e.g., [38, Lemma 2.37])and weakly
compact.ON WEAKLY ALMOST SQUARE BANACH SPACES 5
2.WASQ Banach function spaces
Webeginthissectionwithsomepreliminariesonthe L1spaceofavectormeasure
(see [38, Chapter 3] for the basics on this topic). Let (Ω ,Σ) be a measurable space,
letXbe a Banach space and let ν: Σ→Xbe a countably additive measure. A set
A∈Σ is said to be ν-null ifν(B) = 0 for every B∈Σ withB⊆A. The family of
allν-null sets is denoted by N(ν). We say that a property holds ν-a.e.if it holds
on some A∈Σ such that Ω \A∈ N(ν). We say that a set A∈Σ\N(ν) is an atom
ofνif for every B∈Σ withB⊆Awe have either B∈ N(ν) orA\B∈ N(ν). We
say that νisnon-atomic if it has no atoms. By a Rybakov control measure ofνwe
mean a ﬁnite measure of the form µ=|x∗
0◦ν|(the variation of the signed measure
x∗
0◦ν: Σ→R) for some x∗
0∈X∗such that N(µ) =N(ν) (see, e.g., [23, p. 268,
Theorem 2] for a proof of the existence of Rybakov control meas ures).
A Σ-measurable function f: Ω→Ris called ν-integrable iff∈L1(|x∗◦ν|) for
allx∗∈X∗and, for each A∈Σ, there is/integraltext

Af d(x∗◦ν) for all x∗∈X∗.
Identifying functions which coincide ν-a.e., the set L1(ν) of all (equivalence classes
of)ν-integrable functions is a Banach lattice with the ν-a.e. order and the norm
/bardblf/bardblL1(ν):= sup

Ω|f|d|x∗◦ν|.
L1(ν) is an order continuous Banach function space over any Rybakov c ontrol
measure of ν. The (norm 1) operator Iν:L1(ν)→Xdeﬁned by
Iν(f) :=/integraldisplay
Ωf dνfor allf∈L1(ν)
is called the integration operator ofν.
To provide a proof of Theorem 1.1 we need a couple of lemmata. The ﬁr st one
belongs to the folklore (cf. [4, Lemma 6.3.2] for the case of the unit in terval):
Lemma 2.1. Let(Ω,Σ,µ)be a non-atomic ﬁnite measure space. Then there is a
sequence (rn)n∈NinL∞(µ)such that:
(i)|rn|= 1for alln∈N; and
(ii)for each f∈L1(µ)the sequence (frn)n∈Nis weakly null in L1(µ).
A sequence as in the previous lemma will be called a Rademacher-type sequence
on (Ω,Σ,µ).
Lemma 2.2. Let(Ω,Σ)be a measurable space, let Xbe a Banach space and let
ν: Σ→Xbe a non-atomic countably additive measure. Let µbe a Rybakov control
measure of νand let(rn)n∈Nbe a Rademacher-type sequence on (Ω,Σ,µ). Then
for each f∈L1(ν)the sequence (frn)n∈Nis weakly null in L1(ν).
Proof.Fixf∈L1(ν) and take any ϕ∈L1(ν)∗. SinceL1(ν) is an order continuous
Banach function space over µ, there is g∈L1(µ) such that for each h∈L1(ν) we6 J. RODR ´IGUEZ AND A. RUEDA ZOCA
havehg∈L1(µ) and
ϕ(h) =/integraldisplay
Ωhgdµ
(see, e.g., [36, p. 29]). In particular, we have fg∈L1(µ) and so ( fgrn)n∈Nis weakly
null inL1(µ). Hence, ϕ(frn) =/integraltext

Rybakov control measure of νand let ( rn)n∈Nbe a Rademacher-type sequence on
(Ω,Σ,µ).
Fixf∈SL1(ν). For each n∈Nwe have frn∈L1(ν) and

E(2.1)=/bardblf/bardblL1(ν)= 1.
Moreover, the sequence ( frn)n∈Nis weakly null in L1(ν) (by Lemma 2.2).
We claim that /bardblf±frn/bardblL1(ν)→1 asn→ ∞. Indeed, for each n∈Nwe have
1±rn≥0 and so
g±
n:=|f±frn|=|f|(1±rn) =|f|±|f|rn.
Therefore, both sequences ( g+
n)n∈Nand (g−
n)n∈Nconverge weakly to |f|inL1(ν)
(by Lemma 2.2 applied to |f|). Hence, ( Iν(g+
n))n∈Nand (Iν(g−
n))n∈Nconverge
weakly to Iν(|f|) inE, whereIν:L1(ν)→Edenotes the integration operator of ν.
Observe that each g±
nbelongs to the order interval K:= [0,2|f|]⊆L1(ν), which is
uniformly µ-integrable and weakly compact.
SinceR(ν) is relatively norm compact, Iνmaps every bounded, uniformly µ-
integrable subset of L1(ν) to a relatively norm compact subset of E(see, e.g.,
[38, Proposition 3.56(I)]). Therefore, Iν(K) is norm compact. It follows that both
sequences ( Iν(g+
n))n∈Nand (Iν(g−
n))n∈Nare norm convergent to Iν(|f|), so

The rest of this section is devoted to providing applications of Theor em 1.1.
2.1.Ces` aro function spaces. The Ces` aro “operator” is the map f/mapsto→ C(f) de-
ﬁned pointwise by C(f)(x) :=1
x/integraltextx
0f(t)dtfor anyf∈L1[0,1]. Given a rearrange-
ment invariant Banach function space ( E,/bardbl·/bardblE) on [0,1], the Ces` aro function space
[C,E] is the Banach function space on [0 ,1] consisting of all f∈L1[0,1] for which
C(|f|)∈E, equipped with the norm /bardblf/bardbl[C,E]:=/bardblC(|f|)/bardblE.
Corollary 2.3. LetEbe an order continuous rearrangement invariant Banach
function space on [0,1]. Then the Ces` aro function space [C,E]is WASQ.ON WEAKLY ALMOST SQUARE BANACH SPACES 7
Proof.By [18, Theorem 2.1], the formula ν(A) :=C(χA) deﬁnes an E+-valued
countably additive measure on the Lebesgue σ-algebra of [0 ,1] such that νhas the
same null sets as the Lebesgue measure (hence it is non-atomic) an d the range of ν
is relatively norm compact. Since Eis order continuous, we have [ C,E] =L1(ν)
(see [18, Proposition 3.1]). The conclusion now follows from Theorem 1 .1. /square
We stress that the weigthed Ces` aro function space Cp,won [0,1] considered
in [31], for 1 ≤p <∞and a measurable positive function w, is equal to [ C,E] for
E=Lp((xw(x))pdx). Thus, the previous corollary generalizes [31, Lemma 3.3] in
the case of [0 ,1].
2.2.K¨ othe-Bochner spaces. Let(E,/bardbl·/bardblE)beaBanachfunctionspaceonaﬁnite
measure space (Ω ,Σ,µ) and let ( Y,/bardbl· /bardbl) be a Banach space. The K¨ othe-Bochner
spaceE(Y) isthe Banachspaceofall (equivalenceclassesof) strongly µ-measurable
functions f: Ω→Ysuch that /bardblf(·)/bardbl ∈E, with the norm /bardblf/bardblE(Y):=/bardbl/bardblf(·)/bardbl/bardblE.
Here/bardblf(·)/bardbl: Ω→Ris theµ-measurable function given by t/mapsto→ /bardblf(t)/bardbl.
The following result should be compared with [27, Theorem 3.1], where it is
proved that E(Y) is LASQ if Yis LASQ.
Theorem 2.4. Let(Ω,Σ)be a measurable space, let Xbe a Banach lattice and
letν: Σ→Xbe a non-atomic countably additive measure such that R(ν)is a
relatively norm compact subset of X+. Letµbe a Rybakov control measure of ν
and consider E:=L1(ν)as a Banach function space on (Ω,Σ,µ). LetYbe a
Banach space. Then the K¨ othe-Bochner space E(Y)is WASQ.
Proof.Let (rn)n∈Nbe a Rademacher-type sequence on (Ω ,Σ,µ) (see Lemma 2.1).
Fixf∈SE(Y). Thenfrn∈SE(Y)for every n∈Nand we claim that ( frn)n∈N
is weakly null in E(Y). Indeed, given any ϕ∈E(Y)∗, the order continuity of E
allows us to represent ϕas aw∗-scalarly µ-measurable function ϕ: Ω→Y∗such
that/bardblϕ(·)/bardbl ∈E∗, the duality being given by
ϕ(h) =/integraldisplay
Ω/a\}bracketle{tϕ,h/a\}bracketri}htdµfor every h∈E(Y)
(see, e.g., [35, Theorem 3.2.4]). Here we denote by /bardbl · /bardblthe norm of both Y
andY∗, while/a\}bracketle{tϕ,h/a\}bracketri}ht ∈L1(µ) is deﬁned by t/mapsto→ /a\}bracketle{tϕ(t),h(t)/a\}bracketri}ht. Therefore, we have
ϕ(frn) =/integraltext

Moreover, we have /bardblf(·)/bardbl ∈SEand so

To the best of our knowledge, the following corollary seems to be new :
Corollary 2.5. Let(Ω,Σ,µ)be a non-atomic ﬁnite measure space and let Ybe a
Banach space. Then the Lebesgue-Bochner space L1(µ,Y)is WASQ.8 J. RODR ´IGUEZ AND A. RUEDA ZOCA
Remark 2.6. The previous result is also interesting from the point of view of the
identiﬁcationofthe space L1(µ,Y) asthe projectivetensorproduct L1(µ)/hatwide⊗πY(see,
e.g., [23, p. 228, Example 10]). In general, given two Banach spaces XandY, it is
not known whether X/hatwide⊗πYis WASQ if Xis WASQ. It is even open if X/hatwide⊗πYhas
the D2P if Xhas the D2P (see [33, Question 4.2]).
2.3.An example. The aim of this subsection is to give an example of a WASQ
Banach function space as in Theorem 1.1 which is not an L1-space. To do so, we
need to introduce some terminology ﬁrst. Throughout this subsec tion (pn)n∈Nis a
sequence in (1 ,∞).

If (pn)n∈Nis bounded, then the unit vectors form an unconditional basis of ℓ(pn)
(see, e.g., [41, Theorem 3.5]) and so [2, Proposition 5.2] applies to get :
Corollary 2.7. Suppose that (pn)n∈Nis bounded and let (Xn)n∈Nbe a sequence of
Banach spaces which are WASQ. Then ℓ(pn)(Xn)is WASQ.
We denote by λthe Lebesgue measure on the Lebesgue σ-algebra Σ of [0 ,1].
Proposition 2.8. Let(An)n∈Nbe a partition of [0,1]such that An∈Σ\N(λ)for
alln∈N. Then the map ν: Σ→ℓ(pn)given by

(i)νis non-atomic and R(ν)is relatively norm compact.

Proof.Deﬁne ˜ν: Σ→ℓ1by
˜ν(A) :=/parenleftbig
λ(A∩An)/parenrightbig
n∈Nfor allA∈Σ.
Note that ˜ νis ﬁnitely additive and satisﬁes /bardbl˜ν(A)/bardblℓ1=λ(A) for allA∈Σ, hence ˜ ν
is countably additive. Since the inclusion ι:ℓ1֒→ℓ(pn)is a well-deﬁned operator,
the composition ν=ι◦˜ν: Σ→ℓ(pn)is a countably additive measure.
(i) Clearly, we have N(λ) =N(ν), soνis non-atomic. The range of any count-
ably additive Banach space-valued measure is relatively weakly compa ct (see, e.g.,
[23, p. 14, Corollary 7]). Hence, by the Schur property of ℓ1, the set R(˜ν) is rela-
tively norm compact. Alternatively, this can also be deduced from th e usual crite-
rion of relative norm compactness in ℓ1(see, e.g., [21, p. 6, Exercise 6]). Therefore,
R(ν) =ι(R(˜ν)) is relatively norm compact as well.
(ii) follows from (i) and Theorem 1.1 (note that νtakes values in ℓ+
(pn)).
(iii) Fix f∈L1(ν). For each n∈N, letπn∈ℓ∗
(pn)be the the nth-coordinate
functional. Since ( πn◦ν)(A) =λ(A∩An) for all A∈Σ andf∈L1(πn◦ν), we
havef|An∈L1(λn) and
πn(Iν(|f|)) =/integraldisplay
[0,1]|f|d(πn◦ν) =/bardblf|An/bardblL1(λn).
Hence, (/bardblf|An/bardblL1(λn))n∈N=Iν(|f|)∈ℓ(pn). Moreover, the fact that νtakes values
inℓ+
(pn)ensures that
/bardblf/bardblL1(ν)=/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleIν(|f|)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble

Clearly, Φ is a lattice homomorphism. It remains to check that Φ is surj ective.
Let (fn)n∈N∈ℓ(pn)(L1(λn)). Deﬁne f∈L0[0,1] by declaring f|An:=fnfor all
n∈N. Since (pn)n∈Nis bounded, the space ℓ(pn)contains no isomorphic copy of c0
(see, e.g., [41, Theorem 3.5]). Therefore, in order to prove that f∈L1(ν) it suﬃces
to show that f∈L1(|ϕ◦ν|) for every ϕ∈ℓ∗

Remark 2.9. Note that each L1(λn) is WASQ (in fact, it is isometrically isomor-
phic toL1[0,1]). Hence, when ( pn)n∈Nis bounded, the fact that L1(ν) is WASQ
can also be deduced from Corollary 2.7 and Proposition 2.8(iii).
Proposition 2.10. Letνbe as in Proposition 2.8. If (pn)n∈Nis bounded and
pn
(pn−1)logn→0asn→ ∞, thenL1(ν)is not an L1-space.
Proof.Since (pn)n∈Nis bounded, the space ℓ(pn)has an unconditional basis (see,
e.g., [41, Theorem 3.5]). The additional condition on ( pn)n∈Nimplies that ℓ(pn)is
not isomorphic to ℓ1, see [40, Lemma 4]. Therefore, ℓ(pn)cannot be isomorphic to
a complemented subspace of an L1-space (see, e.g., [22, Theorem 3.13]).
SinceL1(ν) contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to ℓ(pn)(this can be
deduced from Proposition 2.8(iii)), it follows that L1(ν) is not an L1-space. /square
For instance, the sequence pn:= 1+(log( n+1))−1/2satisﬁes the conditions of
Proposition 2.10.
3.Proof of Theorem 1.2
The aim of this section is to provide a proof of Theorem 1.2. The ﬁrst s tep
is to prove the result for the space c0, see Theorem 3.5 below. The proof of this
particular case is based on the renorming technique of [10, Theorem 2.4], where it
was shown that every Banach space containing an isomorphic copy o fc0admits
an equivalent norm so that its unit ball contains non-empty relatively weakly open
subsets with arbitrarily small diameter, but every slice has diameter 2.
The symbol N<ωstands for the Baire tree , i.e., the set of all ﬁnitesequences of
positive integers. The empty sequence is included in N<ωas the root of the tree.
The order on N<ωis deﬁned by declaring that α/precedesequalβif and only if βextendsα.
Givenα∈N<ωandp∈N, we denote by α⌢p∈N<ωthe sequence deﬁned by
α⌢p:= (α1,...,α n,p) ifα= (α1,...,α n) orα⌢p:= (p) (a sequence with just
one element) if α=∅. The following is standard (see, e.g., [10, p. 857]):
Lemma 3.1. There exists a bijection φ:N<ω→Nsuch that:
(i)φ(∅) = 1.
(ii)φ(α)≤φ(β)for allα,β∈N<ωwithα/precedesequalβ.
(iii)φ(α⌢j)< φ(α⌢k)for every α∈N<ωand for all j,k∈Nwithj < k.ON WEAKLY ALMOST SQUARE BANACH SPACES 11
Letcbe the subspace of ℓ∞consisting of all convergentsequences and let c(N<ω)
be the subspace of ℓ∞(N<ω) deﬁned by
c(N<ω) :={x∈ℓ∞(N<ω) :x◦φ−1∈c}.
Clearly,c(N<ω) andcare isometric, hence c(N<ω) is isomorphic to c0. We denote
by lim∈c(N<ω)∗the functional deﬁned by
limx:= lim
n→∞x(φ−1(n)) for all x∈c(N<ω).
For each α∈N<ωwe denote by e∗
α∈c(N<ω)∗the functional deﬁned by
e∗
α(x) :=x(α) for all x∈c(N<ω).
Givenα∈N<ωwe deﬁne xα∈ℓ∞(N<ω) by the formula
xα(β) :=/braceleftbigg1 ifβ/precedesequalα

so thatxα∈Sc(N<ω)and limxα=−1. Deﬁne
A:={xα:α∈N<ω} ⊆Sc(N<ω)andK:=conv(A∪−A)⊆Bc(N<ω).
We will need the following result (see [10, Proposition 2.2]):

Lemma 3.4. Let(X,/bardbl·/bardbl)be a Banach space, let S⊆S(X,/bardbl·/bardbl)be a dense set and let
0< δ <1. Suppose that for all 0< r,s < δ and for every ﬁnite set {x1,...,x n} ⊆S
there exists y∈S(X,/bardbl·/bardbl)satisfying
/bardblrxi±sy/bardbl ≤1for every i∈ {1,...,n}.
Then(X,/bardbl·/bardbl)is(r,s)-SQ for all 0< r,s < δ .
Proof.Fix 0< r,s < δ . Choose r < r′< δsuch that s′:=sr′
r< δand then choose
θ >0 such that rθ+r
r′≤1. Take any ﬁnite set {x1,...,x n} ⊆S(X,/bardbl·/bardbl). SinceS
is dense in S(X,/bardbl·/bardbl), there exist x′
1,...,x′

/bardblrxi±sy/bardbl ≤r/bardblxi−x′
i/bardbl+r

Theorem 3.5. Let0< ε <1. Then there exists an equivalent norm |·|onc0such
that:
(i) (c0,|·|)has the slice-D2P.
(ii)There are non-empty relatively weakly open subsets of B(c0,|·|)of arbitrarily
small diameter.
(iii) (c0,|·|)is(r,s)-SQ for all 0< r,s <1−ε
1+ε.
Proof.Let us denote by /bardbl·/bardblZthe norm of the Banach space Z:=c(N<ω)⊕∞c0.
Sincec0andZare isomorphic, it suﬃces to prove the statement of the theorem f or
the space ( Z,/bardbl·/bardblZ). Letc0(N<ω)⊆c(N<ω) be the subspace of all x∈c(N<ω) such
that lim x= 0. For each α∈N<ωwe write eαto denote the element of Sc0(N<ω)
deﬁned by eα(α) = 1 and eα(β) = 0 for every β∈N<ω\{α}.
Let|·|be the Minkowski functional of the closed convex symmetric set
B:=conv/parenleftBig
(A×{0})∪(−A×{0})∪/parenleftbig
(1−ε)BZ+εBc0(N<ω)×{0}/parenrightbig/parenrightBig
⊆Z,
that is,|z|:= inf{t >0 :z∈tB}for allz∈Z. Since (1 −ε)BZ⊆B⊆BZ, it
follows that |·|is an equivalent norm on Zwith unit ball B(Z,|·|)=B. We have
(3.1) /bardblz/bardblZ≤ |z| ≤1
1−ε/bardblz/bardblZfor allz∈Z
and
(3.2) |(x,0)|=/bardbl(x,0)/bardblZ=/bardblx/bardbl∞for allx∈c0(N<ω),
becauseBc0(N<ω)×{0} ⊆B. We denote by /bardbl·/bardblZ∗and|·|Z∗the equivalent norms
onZ∗induced by /bardbl·/bardblZand|·|, respectively. We will check that |·|satisﬁes the
required properties.
Proof of (i). LetS⊆Bbe a slice of B. SinceB\Sis convex and closed, we
have
S∩/parenleftBig
(A×{0})∪(−A×{0})∪/parenleftbig
(1−ε)BZ+εBc0(N<ω)×{0}/parenrightbig/parenrightBig
/\e}atio\slash=∅.
We now distinguish several cases.
Case (a): S∩(A×{0})/\e}atio\slash=∅. Then (xα,0)∈Sfor some α∈N<ω. Observe that
the sequence (( xα⌢n,0))n∈N= ((xα+ 2eα⌢n,0))n∈Nconverges weakly to ( xα,0)
inZ(because ( eα⌢n)n∈Nis weakly null in c0(N<ω)). Since Sis relatively weakly
open inBand (xα⌢n,0)∈Bfor every n∈N, we have ( xα⌢n0,0)∈Sfor large
enoughn0∈N. Hence,
diam|·|(S)≥ |(xα⌢n0,0)−(xα,0)|= 2|(eα⌢n0,0)|(3.2)= 2/bardbl(eα⌢n0,0)/bardblZ= 2
and, therefore, diam |·|(S) = 2.
Case (b): S∩(−A×{0})/\e}atio\slash=∅. The proof that diam |·|(S) = 2 runs similarly as
in (a).
Case (c): S∩((1−ε)BZ+εBc0(N<ω)×{0})/\e}atio\slash=∅. Then we can pick ( x,y)∈BZ
andx′∈Bc0(N<ω)in such a way that
z:= (1−ε)(x,y)+ε(x′,0)∈S.ON WEAKLY ALMOST SQUARE BANACH SPACES 13
We can assume without loss of generality that x′has ﬁnite support, because the
set of all ﬁnitely supported functions from N<ωto [−1,1] is a norm dense subset
ofBc0(N<ω). Choose α∈N<ωsuch that x′(α⌢n) = 0 for every n∈N. Observe
that
x−x(α⌢n)eα⌢n±eα⌢n∈Bc(N<ω)andx′±eα⌢n∈Bc0(N<ω)
and so
z±

= (1−ε)/parenleftbig
x−x(α⌢n)eα⌢n±eα⌢n,y/parenrightbig
+ε(x′±eα⌢n,0)∈B
for every n∈N. SinceSis relatively weakly open in Band both sequences ( z+
n)n∈N
and (z−
n)n∈Nconverge weakly to zinZ, we can ﬁnd n0∈Nlarge enough so that
bothz+
n0andz−
n0belong to S. Hence,
diam|·|(S)≥ |z+
n0−z−
n0|= 2|(eα⌢n0,0)|(3.2)= 2/bardbl(eα⌢n0,0)/bardblZ= 2
and so diam |·|(S) = 2. This ﬁnishes the proof of (i).
Proof of (ii). Fixθ >0. By Lemma 3.2, we can take n∈Nandρ >0 such that
(3.3) diam( Wn,ρ)≤(1−ε)θ

It is clear that Uis a relatively weakly open subset of B. To prove that U/\e}atio\slash=∅we
will check that the vector z0:= (1

We will show that diam |·|(U)≤θ. The key point is the following:

(A×{0})∪(−A×{0})∪/parenleftbig
(1−ε)BZ+εBc0(N<ω)×{0}/parenrightbig/parenrightBig
there isz′∈Wn,ρ×{0}such that |z−z′|<4η.
Indeed, by Lemma 3.3 we can write
(3.4) z=az1−bz2+c((1−ε)u+εv)14 J. RODR ´IGUEZ AND A. RUEDA ZOCA
for some a,b,c≥0 witha+b+c= 1 and
z1,z2∈conv(A×{0}), u∈BZandv∈Bc0(N<ω)×{0}.
Observe that
(lim,0)(z1) = (lim,0)(z2) =−1,
because lim xα=−1 for all α∈N<ω. We also have
|(lim,0)(u)| ≤ /bardbl(lim,0)/bardblZ∗/bardblu/bardblZ≤1 and (lim ,0)(v) = 0.
Thus
−1+εη >(lim,0)(z)(3.4)=−a+b+c(1−ε)(lim,0)(u)
≥ −a+b−c(1−ε) =−a−b−c+2b+εc=−1+2b+εc,
and so 2b+εc < εη. This inequality implies that b < η(bear in mind that ε <1)
and that c < η. Consequently
|z−z1|(3.4)=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(a−1)z1−bz2+c((1−ε)u+εv)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

(⋆)
≤2b+2c <4η,
where inequality ( ⋆) follows from the fact that z1,z2and (1−ε)u+εvbelong
toB=B(Z,|·|). Hence, |z−z1|<4η.
We can write z1= (x,0) for some x∈conv(A). Then lim x=−1 and for each
i∈ {1,...,n}we have
e∗
∅⌢i(x) = (e∗
∅⌢i,0)(z1)≥(e∗
∅⌢i,0)(z)−|(e∗

n−1−5η,
becausez∈Uand|(e∗
∅⌢i,0)|Z∗≤ /bardbl(e∗
∅⌢i,0)/bardblZ∗= 1 (by (3.1)). This implies, with
the notation of Lemma 3.2, that x∈Wn,ρ(recall that η=2
5ρ). Therefore, the
conclusion of the Claimholds taking z′=z1.
Finally, let w1,w2∈Uand ﬁxs >0. Since Uis relatively open in B, we can
ﬁndv1,v2∈Vsuch that |w1−v1| ≤sand|w2−v2| ≤s. By the Claimabove,
there exist v′

2∈Wn,ρ×{0}such that |v1−v′

Asw1,w2∈Uands >0 are arbitrary, we conclude that diam |·|(U)≤θ.
Proof of (iii). We will show that ( Z,|·|) is (r,s)-SQ for any 0 < r,s <1−ε
1+εwith
the help of Lemma 3.4. Let Hbe the norm dense subset of Bc0consisting of all

is norm dense in S(Z,|·|). Fix 0< r,s <1−ε

Let (en)n∈Nbe the usual basis of c0and choose n∈Nlarge enough such that

≤ai+bi+ci((1−ε)+ε)) = 1,
which combined with (3.1) yields
(3.5) |zi±(0,en)| ≤1
1−ε.
Another appeal to (3.1) gives 1 = /bardbl(0,en)/bardblZ≤ |(0,en)| ≤1
1−εand, therefore, the
vectorz:=1

(0,en)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=|(0,en)|−1≤1

This inequality and (3.5) give
|zi±z| ≤1

1−ε=1+ε

Sincer,s≤1−ε
1+ε, we can apply [8, Lemma 6.3] to conclude that
|rzi±sz| ≤1 for every i∈ {1,...,m}.
From Lemma 3.4 it follows that ( Z,| · |) is (r,s)-SQ for all 0 < r,s <1−ε
1+ε. The
proof is ﬁnished. /square
We can now prove Theorem 1.2 in full generality.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. LetZandWbe subspaces of Xsuch that Zis isomorphic
toc0andX=Z⊕W. Fix 0< ε <1 and let | · |Zbe an equivalent norm on Z
like in Theorem 3.5. Since any Banach space admits an equivalent norm f or which
the unit ball has slices of arbitrarily small diameter (see, e.g., [13, Lem ma 2.1]), we
can take an equivalent norm | · |WonWsatisfying that property. Let | · |be the
equivalent norm on Xdeﬁned by |z+w|:= max{|z|Z,|w|W}for every z∈Zand
for every w∈W. We claim that ( X,|·|) satisﬁes all the requirements.
(i) Theℓ∞-sum of two Banach spaces has the slice-D2P whenever one of the
factors has the slice-D2P (see, e.g., [32, Theorem 2.29]). Since ( Z,| · |Z) has the
slice-D2P, we conclude that the same holds for ( X,|·|).16 J. RODR ´IGUEZ AND A. RUEDA ZOCA
(ii) Let us prove that B(X,|·|)contains non-empty relatively weakly open subsets
of arbitrarily small diameter. Fix η >0. Then there exists a non-empty relatively
weaklyopen set U⊆B(Z,|·|Z)with diam |·|Z(U)< η. Now, takea slice SofB(W,|·|W)
with diam |·|W(S)< η. Since the map ϕ:B(Z,|·|Z)×B(W,|·|W)→B(X,|·|)given by
ϕ(z,w) :=z+wfor all (z,w)∈B(Z,|·|Z)×B(W,|·|W)
is a homeomorphism when each of the balls is equipped with the restrict ion of the
weak topology, it follows that V:=ϕ(U×S) is a relatively weakly open subset of
B(X,|·|). Clearly, V/\e}atio\slash=∅and diam |·|(V)< η, as desired.
(iii) The space ( X,| · |) is (r,s)-SQ for arbitrary 0 < r,s <1−ε
1+ε, because so is
(Z,| · |Z) and the ℓ∞-sum of two Banach spaces is ( r,s)-SQ whenever one of the
factors is ( r,s)-SQ (see [8, Proposition 6.6]). /square
