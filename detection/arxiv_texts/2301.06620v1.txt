Abstract
Humans have developed considerable machinery used at scale to create policies and to distribute
incentives, yet we are forever seeking ways in which to improve upon these, our institutions.
Especially when funding is limited, it is imperative to optimise spending without sacriﬁcing
positive outcomes, a challenge which has often been approached within several areas of social,
life and engineering sciences. These studies often neglect the availability of information, cost
restraints, or the underlying complex network structures, which deﬁne real-world populations.
Here, we have extended these models, including the aforementioned concerns, but also tested
the robustness of their ﬁndings to stochastic social learning paradigms. Akin to real-world deci-
sions on how best to distribute endowments, we study several incentive schemes, which consider
information about the overall population, local neighbourhoods, or the level of inﬂuence which
a cooperative node has in the network, selectively rewarding cooperative behaviour if certain
criteria are met. Following a transition towards a more realistic network setting and stochastic
behavioural update rule, we found that carelessly promoting cooperators can often lead to their
downfall in socially diverse settings. These emergent cyclic patterns not only damage coopera-
tion, but also decimate the budgets of external investors. Our ﬁndings highlight the complexity
of designing effective and cogent investment policies in socially diverse populations.

1 Introduction
The design of mechanisms that encourage pro-social behaviours in populations of self-regarding
agents is recognised as a major theoretical challenge within several areas of social, life and
engineering sciences. It is ubiquitous in real-world situations, not least ecosystems, human or-
ganisations, technological innovations and social networks (Andras et al., 2018, Dafoe et al.,
2021, Han et al., 2019, Raghunandan and Subramanian, 2012, Santos et al., 2006, Sigmund
et al., 2001). In this context, cooperation is typically assumed to emerge from the combined
actions of individuals within the system. However, in many scenarios, such behaviours are
advocated and promoted by an external party, which is not part of the system, calling for a
new set of heuristics capable of engineering a desired collective behaviour in a self-organised
complex system (Penn et al., 2010). Among these heuristics, several have been identiﬁed as
capable of promoting desired behaviours at a minimal cost (Chen et al., 2015, Cimpeanu et al.,
2023, 2021, Duong et al., 2022, Duong and Han, 2021, Han et al., 2018, Han and Tran-Thanh,
2018, Wang et al., 2019). However, these studies neglect the diversiﬁed nature of contexts and
social structures which deﬁne real-world populations. Here, we analyse the impact of diver-
sity by means of scale-free interaction networks with dissimilar levels of clustering (Barab ´asi
and Albert, 1999, Santos and Pacheco, 2005), and test various interference mechanisms using
simulations of agents facing a cooperative dilemma.
For instance, if one considers a near future, where hybrid societies comprising humans and
machines shall prevail, it is important to identify the most effective incentives to be included to
leveraging cooperation in such hybrid collectives (Andras et al., 2018, Dafoe et al., 2021, Han
et al., 2021, Paiva et al., 2018). In a different context, let us consider a wildlife management
organisation (e.g., the WWF) that aims to maintain a desired level of biodiversity in a particular
region. In order to do that, the organisation, not being part of the region’s ecosystem, has to
decide whether to modify the current population of some species, and if so, then when, and in
what degree to interfere in the ecosystem (i.e., to modify the composition of the population)
(Levin, 2000). Since a more impactful intervention typically implies larger costs in terms of hu-
man resources and equipment, the organisation has to achieve a balance between cogent wildlife
management and a low total investment cost. Moreover, due to the evolutionary dynamics of
the eco-system (e.g., frequency and structure dependence) (Hofbauer and Sigmund, 1998, May-
nard Smith, 1982, Santos et al., 2006), undesired behaviours can reoccur over time, for example
when the interference was not sufﬁciently strong in the past. Given this, the decision-maker4
also has to take into account the fact that it will have to repeatedly interfere in the eco-system
in order to sustain levels of biodiversity over time. That is, they must ﬁnd an efﬁcient interfer-
ence mechanism that leads to their desired goals, while also keeping in mind potential budget
concerns.
Speciﬁcally, we consider populations of individuals distributed in a scale-free network, who
interact with their neighbours via the one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD), where uncooperative
behaviour is preferred over cooperation (Perc et al., 2017, Rand and Nowak, 2013, Santos et al.,
2006, Sigmund, 2010). As an outside decision maker, we aim to promote cooperation by in-
terfering in the system, rewarding particular agents in the population at speciﬁc moments. The
research question here is to identify when and how much to invest (in individuals distributed in
a network) at each time step, in order to achieve cooperation within the system such that the
total cost of interference is minimised, taking into account the fact that individuals might have
different levels of social connectivity. For instance, we might wonder whether it is sufﬁcient to
focus the investment only on highly connected cooperators, as they are more inﬂuential. Would
targeting inﬂuencers reduce overall costs? Do we need to take into account a neighbourhood’s
cooperativeness level, which was shown to play an important role in square lattice networks
(Han et al., 2018)? Also, when local information is not available and only global statistics can
be used in the decision making process, how different are the results in heterogeneous networks,
in comparison to regular graphs (i.e. homogeneous networks)?
To answer these questions, this paper will systematically investigate different general classes
or approaches of interference mechanisms, which are based on i)the global population statis-
tics such as its current composition, ii)a node’s degree centrality in the network and iii)the
neighbourhood properties, such as local cooperativeness level.
Our results show that interference on scale-free networks is not trivial. In particular, we
highlight that the inconsiderate distribution of incentives can lead to the exploitation of coop-
erators. We present which mechanisms are more efﬁcient at fostering cooperation, arguing that
social diversity and the network’s clustering coefﬁcient both play a key role in the choice of
interference mechanisms available to institutions wishing to promote cooperation.5
2 Model and Methods
2.1 Prisoner’s Dilemma on Scale Free Networks
We consider a population of agents on scale-free networks of contacts (SF NoCs) — a widely
adopted heterogeneous population structure in population dynamics and evolutionary games.
We focus our analysis on the efﬁciency of various interference mechanisms in spatial settings,
adopting an agent-based model directly comparable with the setup of recent lab experiments on
cooperation (Rand et al., 2014). Moreover, we select an initial number of nodes m0= 2, with
two additional edges being created at every time step of network generation. This produces
networks of average connectivity z= 4, serving as a direct comparison between this work and
other studies performed on structured populations (Han et al., 2018).
Initially each agent in a population of size Nis designated either as a cooperator (C) or de-
fector (D) with equal probability. Agents’ interaction is modelled using the one-shot Prisoner’s
Dilemma game, where mutual cooperation (mutual defection) yields the reward R(penaltyP)
and unilateral cooperation gives the cooperator the sucker’s payoff Sand the defector the temp-
tationT. As a popular interaction model of structured populations (Szab ´o and F ´ath, 2007), we
adopt the following scaled payoff matrix of the PD (for row player):
 C D
C 1 0
D b 0!
;
withb(1< b2) representing the temptation to defect. We adopt this weak version of the
Prisoner’s Dilemma in spite of cooperation prevalence shown in previous works on scale-free
networks (Santos et al., 2008), so as to have a direct comparison with studies on the effects of
rewarding mechanisms in different types of networks (Han et al., 2018).
At each time step or generation, each agent plays the PD with its immediate neighbours. The
score for each agent is the sum of the payoffs in these encounters. Before the start of the next
generation, the conditions of interference are checked for each agent and, if they qualify, the
external decision maker increases their payoff. Multiple mechanisms (i.e. multiple conditions)
can be active at once, but the individual investment cannot be applied more than once; the
schemes determine the eligibility for investment.
At the start of the next generation, each agent’s strategy is updated using one of two social6
learning paradigms – a deterministic , or a stochastic rule. Using a deterministic update rule,
each agent will choose to imitate the strategy of its highest scored neighbour (Nowak and May,
1992, Szab ´o and F ´ath, 2007). In the stochastic case, instead of copying the highest scored
neighbour, at the end of each generation an agent Awith scorefAchooses to copy the strategy
of a randomly selected neighbour agent Bwith scorefBwith a probability given by the Fermi
rule (Traulsen et al., 2006):
(1 +e(fA fB)=K) 1;
whereKdenotes the amplitude of noise in the imitation process (Szab ´o and F ´ath, 2007). In line
with previous works and lab experiments (Rand et al., 2013, Szab ´o and F ´ath, 2007, Zisis et al.,
2015), we set K= 0:1in our simulations. Our analysis will be based on this standard evolu-
tionary process in order to focus on understanding the cost-efﬁciency of different interference
mechanisms.
We simulate this evolutionary process until a stationary state or a cyclic pattern is reached.
The simulations converge quickly in the case of deterministic update, with the exception of
some cyclic patterns which never reach a stationary state. Because this work studies cost effec-
tive intervention, these rarely-occurring patterns which inherently invite very large total costs
are escaped early by running simulations for 75 generations (deterministic update) and 500 gen-
erations (stochastic update), at which point the accumulated costs are excessive enough for this
mechanism to not be of interest. The difference in the ﬁnal number of generations accounts
for the slower convergence time associated with stochastic dynamics. Moreover, the results are
averaged for the last 25 generations of the simulations for a clear and fair comparison (e.g. due
to cyclic patterns). In order to improve accuracy related to the randomness of network topology
in scale-free networks, each set of parameter values is ran on 10 different pre-seeded graphs for
both types of SF NOCs. Furthermore, the results for each combination of network and param-
eter values are obtained from averaging 30 independent realisations. It is important to note that
the distribution of cooperators and defectors on the network is different for every realisation.
Note that we do not consider mutations or random explorations when employing a deter-
minstic update rule. Thus, whenever the population reaches a homogeneous state (i.e. when
the population consists of 100% of agents adopting the same strategy), it will remain in that
state regardless of interference. Hence, whenever detecting such a state, no further interference
will be made. Errors can sometimes occur under the presence of stochastic imitation, thus we
never preemptively pause these simulations. Given the difference in convergence time, network
size and stopping conditions, we do not directly compare the total costs between these two7
paradigms.
2.2 Cost-Efﬁcient Interference in Networks
We aim to study how one can efﬁciently interfere in spatially heterogeneous populations to
achieve high levels of cooperation while minimising the cost of interference. An investment
decision consists of a cost  > 0to the external decision-making agent/investor, and this value
is added as surplus to the payoff of each suitable candidate. In order to determine cost-
efﬁciency, we vary for each proposed interference strategy, measuring the total accumulated
costs to the investor. Thus, the most efﬁcient interference schemes will be the ones with the
lowest relative total cost.
Moreover, in line with previous works on network interference (Chen et al., 2015, Han et al.,
2018, Han and Tran-Thanh, 2018), we compare global interference strategies where investments
are triggered based on network-wide information, local neighbourhood information, and, lastly,
node centrality information.
In the population-based (POP ) approach, a decision to invest in desirable behaviours is
based on the current composition of the population. We denote xcthe fraction of individuals in
the population adopting cooperative behaviour. Namely, an investment is made if xcis at most
equal to a threshold pc(i.e. whenxcpc), for 0pc1. They do not invest otherwise (i.e.
xc>pc). The value pcdescribes how rare the desirable behaviours should be to trigger external
support.
In the neighbourhood-based (NEB ) approach, committing an abuse of notation, a decision
to invest is based on the fraction xcof neighbours of a focal individual with the desirable be-
haviours, calculated at the local level. Investment happens if xcis at most equal to a threshold
nc(i.e. whenxcnc), for 0nc1; otherwise, no investment is made.
As the presence of structural heterogeneity in scale-free networks introduces a level of in-
equality between nodes in terms of inﬂuence, we also examine a node-inﬂuence-based (NI)
approach. To achieve this, we make use of degree centrality. We denote by xithe node’s
centrality measure. The decision-maker invests in a cooperator node Cwhen the value of its
degree centrality is above a threshold of inﬂuence cI, for 0cI1. Otherwise, i.e. when
0xi< cI, no investment is made. The value cIdescribes how inﬂuential a cooperator node
should be to trigger an investment into its survival.
For the POP and NEB schemes, the threshold signiﬁes an increase in the number of nodes8
that satisfy the requirements for investment. In other words, a threshold of 1 means always
investing in all nodes which follow the desired strategy. Conversely, a lower threshold implies a
more careful approach to investment, whereby the exogenous agent is stricter in their selection
of suitable candidates. The opposite is true for NI, as a value of 1 implies only the most con-
nected individual(s) is eligible for investment; whereas a value of 0 means investing in every
cooperative agent.
Interestingly, we posit that these mechanisms require different levels of information, which
may or may not be readily available in the given network. In some cases, such as social net-
works, the connectivity (i.e. the number of friends) of a node is virtually free information which
requires no effort on the part of the external decision maker to discern. On the other hand,
neighbour-hood based approaches inherently require more information about the population
and the level of cooperativeness in different parts of the network. Thus, POP is a broad mech-
anism which only requires knowledge about overall cooperativeness, but NEB invites complex
information gathering, in order to determine the cooperativeness in each neighbourhood. Com-
bining NI with NEB does not require any additional observation than NEB by itself. Our study
of neighbourhood based interference does not directly take into account the cost of gathering
information, it is a comparison between perceived gains in cooperation and the associated per-
individual cost of interference set out in the interference mechanisms. Our discussion will nat-
urally present these subtle differences in the hierarchy of information gathering, as they signal
hidden costs for some application domains.
3 Results
In contrast to the study on square lattice networks (Han et al., 2018), we found that performing
cost-effective interventions on SF NOCs exhibits complex patterns and presents multiple con-
cerns. In structured populations, more detailed observations resulted in effective interventions
with improved outcomes. On the other hand, more knowledge about the population in SF NOCs
simply reduces the risk of interfering to the detriment of cooperators. In other words, interfering
in SF NOCs without adequate knowledge should be approached cautiously or it could act to the
beneﬁt of defectors. This issue is prevalent in SF networks with low clustering (BA model), but
also sees some representation in highly clustered (DMS) networks if stochastic dynamics are
taken into account.
Successfully investing in BA populations broadly requires heavy-handed investment and9
large individual endowments (often orders of magnitude higher than similar mechanisms per-
formed on square lattice populations) or a blanketing mechanism that targets all or almost all
cooperators, even those which are not necessarily in danger of converting to defection. Con-
verging to 100% C is very difﬁcult unless both of these conditions are met and this introduces
multiple concerns in the role of an exogenous interfering party. We avoid focusing on solu-
tions where the per-generation cost is excessive, as it is unlikely for any institution to be able
to produce unrealistically high endowments, as required by these heterogeneous networks. In-
stead we focus on effective intervention with manageable amounts of per-generation cost. In
the following subsections, we structure our results based upon the most important ﬁndings, and
provide relevant references to each studied investment scheme where appropriate. Initially, we
will present the results for the deterministic update scheme, then the stochastic update, pointing
out any difference between the two. All the main ﬁndings are robust irrespective of the social
learning paradigm employed.
3.1 Careless rewarding leads to the exploitation of cooperators
In direct contrast with previous ﬁndings for positive incentives (Chen et al., 2015, Han et al.,
2018, Han and Tran-Thanh, 2018), an external decision maker should only interfere in scale-free
networks with great care, as investing indiscriminately can lead to the detriment of cooperation
(see Figure 1). We observe that inclusive approaches to interference negatively impact the
mean frequency of cooperation if the individual endowments are not sufﬁcient to turn defectors
away from the temptation of defecting. By inclusive approaches, we imply high values for
the threshold that determines the eligibility of investment (for POP and NEB schemes). If
an external investor hedges their bets , targeting a wide spread of nodes (high threshold) with
reduced individual endowments, they risk dooming cooperators. In such a scenario, we see the
formation of cyclic patterns, ultimately allowing D players to exploit cooperators (see Figure
2). In this way, an investor would be artiﬁcially allowing the survival of cooperators in clusters
dominated by defectors, abetting the possibility of these sparsely connected clusters to take over
larger formations which cannot easily be maintained by defectors. We note that some of these
cyclic patterns eventually converge to a stable state, but the accumulated costs of interference
at the end of these long-lasting patterns is prohibitively large.
In the presence of deterministic selection, this ﬁnding is mostly restricted to classical scale-
free networks with low clustering (generated using the BA model), but relaxing the intensity of10

selection produces similar results even with more realistic levels of clustering (see Figure 7).
Social diversity changes the inherent nature of the problem of rewarding cooperators effectively.
Previous results show the emergence of cooperation in heterogeneous networks (Santos et al.,
2006, 2008) (shown also in horizontal red lines in Figure 1). Compared to homogeneous (well-
mixed) and structured populations, there is little improvement to be made in these settings. As
the room for improvement narrows, the risk of acting to the detriment of cooperators increases.
Individual benefactors prosper temporarily, but the recipients of their naivety are none other
than the defectors who exploit them.
3.2 Clustering reduces the burden of investment
Real-world networks have been observed to have higher levels of clustering than what normally
occurs in typical scale-free networks (Barrat and Pastor-Satorras, 2005, Su et al., 2016). Nev-
ertheless, several domains, such as the topology of the WWW remain, in which the nodes are
sparsely clustered (Albert et al., 1999, Barabasi, 2014, Barab ´asi, 2016). Thus, it is important
to design interference schemes which can target either type of scale-free networks, especially
so if there exists a degree of uncertainty about the presence of clusters, or if measuring this
factor is unfeasible. We have already mentioned the risks associated with inadequate reward
mechanisms, but now we can turn to unveiling the beneﬁts associated with social diversity and
clustering in the quest towards engineering pro-social behaviour.
Highly clustered networks often have the most room to improve by receiving endowments
(See Figure 1). The initial distribution of players in the hubs of the network often determines
whether the direction towards which the population will converge. Often, a small nudge can
steer the population towards a desirable outcome (see Figure 2). Moreover, this can easily be
accomplished through a variety of disparate investment paradigms. For instance, metrics on the
overall population (POP) can be used to guarantee maximal cooperation regardless of how the
endowments are distributed (See Figure 3). With the reduction in the complexity of design-
ing an effective scheme, we look towards cost and ways to reduce overspending. Overeager
endowments can lead to total costs several orders of magnitude larger than those applied as
a last resort. Indeed, even very small endowments applied to few surviving cooperators can
jumpstart the formation of clusters resilient to invasion. Increasing the threshold for investment
guarantees that more cooperators will be eligible for the endowments, thus exacerbating spend-
ing. Lowering this threshold guarantees that interference will only be triggered if desperately13

required. Investing in every cooperator as a last resort ensures pro-sociality.
Moreover, local observations can be used to ensure positive outcomes following a variety
of pathways (see Figure 4). In this case, an external decision maker must target a range of
intermediate values for the threshold. Previous results on structured populations showed that
investing in cooperator neighbourhoods with exactly one defector was the optimal way of fos-
tering cooperation (Han et al., 2018). In contrast, our ﬁndings suggest that the opposite is true
for heterogeneous settings. Indeed, the least expensive routes towards cooperation are those
with low or intermediate thresholds, suggesting that investors should focus their attention on
ensuring only the survival of cooperators who are in danger of turning. For highly clustered
networks, little investment is needed, and provided the threshold is not exceedingly low, maxi-
mal cooperation can be reached in any conﬁguration, without unnecessary expenditure. Lowly14

clustered networks, on the other hand, require much more deliberate endowments to beneﬁt
from investment, with the added risk of causing cooperators to fall victim to exploitation as
discussed previously in Figure 4.
3.3 Heterogeneity and network characteristics play a key role in the de-
sign of effective investment mechanisms
Assuming that information about a node’s inﬂuence can be easily gleamed by an external deci-
sion maker, this can provide a partial solution to reducing the risk of deleterious interference.
Although comparatively costly, this mechanism has the beneﬁt of never succumbing to the ex-
ploitation of cooperators (see Figure 5). Notwithstanding, the very nature of inﬂuential nodes15

in scale-free networks (i.e. power-law degree distribution) implies only exceedingly large en-
dowments are sufﬁcient to sway them. However, the number of cooperators who are eligible for
investment is also small; on account of this, overall spending does not scale predictably with the
endowment amount. We have previously mentioned that there exist some costs associated with
information gathering, which we do not model or measure here. Hence, the assumption that
information about inﬂuence is readily available suggests this method could prevail in respect to
real-world budgeting.
We propose that combining several interference mechanisms can be an effective way of re-
ducing spending while avoiding the pitfalls of pernicious investment. For instance, we might
consider taking into account an agent’s inﬂuence as well as local observations. In Figure 6,
we explore this possibility, avoiding the least connected nodes (i.e. not investing in the bottom16

either of the two interference schemes taken individually. These results suggest that hubs play
an important role in the emergence of cooperation in highly clustered networks, but that they
cannot be effectively used to improve outcomes in their lowly clustered counterparts. Never-
theless, this integrated approach to interference eliminates the possibility of investment being
detrimental to cooperation.
We note this conundrum between the two types of heterogeneous networks. Lowly clustered
networks have little to beneﬁt from investment, and much to lose if the external investor is
negligent in their distribution of endowments. On the other hand, highly clustered networks
have much to gain and little to lose, readily responding positively to any tactic, overspending17

being the only matter of discontent. As investment in the greater context of heterogeneous
interactions is not trivial, it would therefore be prudent to ﬁrst collect as much data on the nature
of the network before deciding to distribute endowments. Uncertainty about social diversity or
clustering carries the additional risk of selecting an improper policy of designing incentive
schemes.
3.4 Stochastic imitation increases the risk of exploitation
Previously, we had shown that careless rewards might lead to an increase in defectors when
interfering in BA networks under a deterministic update paradigm (see Subsection 3.1). Fol-
lowing a transition towards a more realistic, stochastic update rule (Traulsen et al., 2006), we
observe a very similar phenomenon and moreover, ﬁnd that it is no longer limited to lowly18

approached with the same due diligence as BA networks, and insufﬁcient endowments often
lead to the exploitation of cooperators. Relying solely on local information is most prone to
damaging cooperation, in spite of the level of complexity associated with this scheme and the
amount of information required to enforce it (See Figure 8).
Interestingly, stochastic imitation leads to a signiﬁcant increase in baseline cooperation prior
to interference in highly clustered networks, and conversely a decrease in cooperation in classi-
cal scale-free networks (see horizontal lines in Figure 7). Nevertheless, the ﬁndings discussed
in the sections above remain robust. Although the potential gains to be had shift, causing BA
networks to beneﬁt from investment more than their highly clustered counterparts, the previous
ﬁndings still apply in this setting. For instance, we ﬁnd that DMS networks readily respond to19

investment, and are not as prone to the pitfalls which befall BA networks. In Figure 9, we show
that the most efﬁcient interference schemes are consistently one (or more) order(s) of magnitude
less costly at promoting cooperation in highly clustered networks, regardless of what potential
gains the external decision makers is aiming for.
3.5 Maximal cooperation gains require signiﬁcant endowments. Cost-
efﬁciency is a double-edged sword.
Unlike homogeneous populations, heterogeneous interaction structures inherently provide a
beneﬁt to cooperators, something usually referred to as network reciprocity (Santos et al., 2006,
2008). In practice, this means investment does not lead to outcomes which differ signiﬁcantly
from the baseline. Furthermore, successful attempts at reaching a maximal level of coopera-
tion (i.e. little to no defection) require a combination of large endowments and an investment
scheme which can target individuals at all levels of the network (see Figure 7). Using pop-
ulation level metrics generally fails to improve outcomes unless virtually every cooperator is
targeted (see Figure 10). Equivalently, relying on degree centrality (i.e. how inﬂuential a node
is) necessitates an egalitarian distribution of endowments, which naturally increases costs (See
Figure 11). Local information (NEB), while risky, also has the potential to best improve out-
comes while reducing costs, and this remains true for both BA and DMS networks, if maximal
cooperation gains are required (See Figure 9). Once again, we intuit the importance of acquiring
detailed observations of information about the agents. This approach is a double-edged sword;
it is simultaneously the optimal solution, as well as the most prone to errors in decision-making,
leading the population to either the most perceived gains or the least (See Figure 8). This seems
to be another dilemma. Investing is risky, and it is likely for endowments to be ineffective or
even produce negative results, but only signiﬁcant sums of capital are likely to lead to desirable
outcomes. Social diversity complicates this further, as there exists a great degree of inequality
between individuals, and potential errors in decision-making make investment precarious.
4 Discussion
In summary, we have studied how optimally an external decision maker could incentivise a
population of autonomous agents facing a cooperative dilemma to fulﬁl a coveted collective
state. We build on a previous account which identiﬁed the most effective mechanisms to foster22

cooperative scenarios in spatially distributed systems in regular graph structured populations
of agents, but instead we consider two popular models of scale-free networks of contacts. In
particular, we examined if the insights set out in the context of regular graphs remain applica-
ble to heterogeneous models, as well as explore an additional avenue of interference enabled
by the variance in node connectivity. To address these issues, we combined an evolutionary
game theoretic model with several incentive mechanisms in two types of pre-generated net-
works characterised by preferential attachment, with different clustering coefﬁcients. We argue
that this problem cannot be solved trivially and we show that transitivity (i.e. the global cluster-
ing coefﬁcient) should be the driving force behind the choice of an interference mechanism in
promoting cooperation in heterogeneous network structures, as well as its application.
In this work, we introduce several incentive mechanisms which are deﬁned formally and
mathematically. We note that they do not have to be deﬁned as such, and in fact have many
real-life counterparts which are often employed by institutions and investors. For instance,
POP-based metrics describe cooperation observed at a global scale. If we consider the Great
Recession, or the recent COVID-19 pandemic, an institution might only need to look at the
overall state of the economy, or the spread of an infection, before deciding that action is re-
quired. Neighbourhood-based metrics represent local schemes, which are almost ubiquitous
when considering social inequality. Whether it is housing schemes, incentives to stop smoking,
homelessness, education, etc., local governments often decide to invest based on the level of
economic and social deprivation in a speciﬁc area, and that is precisely what we have tried to
capture with NEB-based schemes. Finally, we have looked at centrality (inﬂuence) metrics.
If we consider social media, a company might wish to use inﬂuencers to market its products,
or an institution might decide to speciﬁcally target someone in the public eye in order to in-
crease the visibility of its incentives, whether they were positive or negative. The mechanisms
we have chosen are by no means exhaustive choices, but they serve as a fundamental starting
point to our discussion, and they are arguably the most common and most easily implementable
mechanisms that we observe in the real world.
We ﬁnd that impetuously rewarding cooperators can lead to cyclic patterns which damage
cooperation in the long run, enabling the exploitation of cooperators to the beneﬁt of defectors.
We argue that detailed information gathering about the networks and agents prior to the distri-
bution of endowments can prevent these mistakes. Using two social learning paradigms, we
show the robustness of these ﬁndings and observe that clustering lowers the risk of deleterious
investment, easing the strictness of distributing incentives. Moreover, we show that ignoring24
lowly connected individuals leads to unproﬁtable and even futile intervention irrespective of
network transitivity.
Our comparison between the two types of scale-free networks provides valuable insights
regarding the importance of clustering in the outcome of cooperation. We ﬁnd that a large
clustering coefﬁcient allows for successful, cost-effective interference, indeed even when partly
disregarding a full comprehension of the population and its tendencies. Furthermore, transitivity
lessens the burden on external investors, lowering the total cost required to enforce cooperation.
These results are of particular interest, given that most SF networks portray high clustering,
such as in the case of social ties where friends are likely to be friends of each other (Newman,
2018). This scope encompasses heterogeneous scenarios inhibited by spatial constraints (e.g.
in highly urbanised areas or even the allotment of rangelands such as pastures), where high
clustering is also imposed.
Transitioning towards a more realistic, stochastic imitation rule (Traulsen et al., 2006), we
measure a shift between the two network types, whereby lowly clustered networks prescribe a
greater need for investment, and vice-versa. Maximal cooperation gains in either paradigm can
generally be achieved using large individual endowments. Notwithstanding, highly clustered
networks respond more readily to interference, and we provide several insights about ways in
which cost could be reduced further.
An important question in models of institutional incentives is that of setting up and main-
taining the incentive budget. Considering who should contribute to the incentive budget is a
social dilemma in itself, and addressing this second-order social dilemma has been identiﬁed as
a challenging research problem. Several solutions have been identiﬁed, including pool incen-
tives with second-order punishments (Perc, 2012, Sigmund et al., 2010), democratic decisions
(Hilbe et al., 2014), commitment formation (Han, 2022, Han et al., 2015, Sasaki et al., 2015),
and hybrid incentives (Chen et al., 2015, G ´ois et al., 2019). This work does not aim to address
this issue, focusing instead on how to optimise the spending from a given budget by exploit-
ing network properties and information gathering. However, it would be interesting to study
the co-evolutionary institutional formation with different interference strategies and individual
strategic behaviours. Moreover, in this work, we do not consider the possibility of detecting the
existence of a certain type of interference from an external party. In reality, individuals could
be aware of active interference and react by changing their behaviour, either to become suitable
candidates for reward or to avoid sanctions (Cimpeanu and Han, 2020).
In summary, we have shown that it is crucial to investigate both the underlying network, and25
behavioural trends before distributing endowments. Previously, these ﬁndings were restricted
to very particular combinations of parameters, but stochastic dynamics highlight the pitfalls
of inconsiderate incentives in a variety of settings. As a result of such careless interference,
defector communities grow before eventually collapsing due to their inability to reciprocate.
We have identiﬁed several key metrics which can be used to mitigate these risks and ensure
positive social outcomes. Our ﬁndings highlight the complexity of designing effective and
cogent investment policies in socially diverse populations.
