Abstract
In this paper, an automatic algorithm aimed at volumetric segmentation
of acute ischemic stroke lesion in non-contrast computed tomography brain
3D images is proposed. Our deep-learning approach is based on the pop-
ular 3D U-Net convolutional neural network architecture, which was mod-
ied by adding the squeeze-and-excitation blocks and residual connections.
Robust pre-processing methods were implemented to improve the segmen-
tation accuracy. Moreover, a specic patches sampling strategy was used
to address the large size of medical images, to smooth out the eect of the
class imbalance problem and to stabilize neural network training. All experi-
ments were performed using ve-fold cross-validation on the dataset contain-
ing non-contrast computed tomography volumetric brain scans of 81 patients
diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. Two radiology experts manually seg-
mented images independently and then veried the labeling results for incon-
sistencies. The quantitative results of the proposed algorithm and obtained
segmentation were measured by the Dice similarity coecient, sensitivity,
specicity and precision metrics. Our proposed model achieves an average
Dice of 0:6280:033, sensitivity of 0 :6990:039, specicity of 0 :99650:0016
and precision of 0 :6190:036, showing promising segmentation results.

Introduction
Acute cerebral circulation disorder or stroke is a disease with high rates
of morbidity and mortality worldwide. According to the American Heart
Association, the most common type of stroke is ischemic [1]. Early diagnosis
of stroke is crucial for treatment choice [2, 3], because tissue changes in the
ischemic penumbra may be reversible, especially in the early stages [4, 5].
The choice of diagnostic methods in each specic case strongly depends not
only on its applicability (availability, contraindications, patient's condition,
etc.), but also on the time of symptoms onset [6]. Any delay in medical care
increases the risk of severe consequences and death.
Neuroimaging is fundamental to most modern methods of dierential di-
agnosis of acute stroke [5, 7{12]. For some imaging procedures, contrast in-
jection is required, which is related to the risk of complications and a number
of contraindications. The analysis of Computed Tomography (CT) and Mag-
netic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans is an integral part of the examination
guidelines for patients with signs and symptoms of acute stroke [7{9].
CT is the most common diagnostic tool for acute ischemic stroke (AIS)
due to its availability (a large number of screening centers, low cost, no
contraindications and low body burden) and short screening duration [7, 8,
13]. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) was rst used in the evaluation of AIS patients
in 1995 to detect intracranial hemorrhage (hemorrhagic stroke) and select a
treatment strategy at an early time window (within 3 hours of symptoms
onset) [15,16] and proved to be ecient [13,14,17]. When diagnosing stroke,
NCCT demonstrates relatively high specicity and low sensitivity, however,
it allows detecting blood clots in cerebral vessels and intracranial hemorrhage
(hemorrhagic stroke) which are absolute contraindications for some strategies
of AIS treatment [9,17].
Interpretation of NCCT scans is associated with certain diculties, since
early AIS changes look like areas of slightly reduced density, which the hu-
man eye due to various factors cannot always distinguish from the normal
tissues [3,7,19]. In addition, images often show artefacts (caused by patient
movements or imaging camera) that may look like strokes [8]. Therefore,
2developing of automated procedures for localization and assessment of AIS
tissues volume based on NCCT scans [19{26] (including the procedures based
on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [19{22]) is an urgent task. Ran-
domized controlled trials [19,27{29] have shown that CNN-based methods are
comparable to radiologists in terms of sensitivity, specicity, overall accuracy,
AUC, ROC, etc. It allows using CNNs as auxiliary tool in clinical practice.
In addition, automated processing based on 3D CNNs allows volumetric anal-
ysis taking into account the spatial context and the rapid detection of small
ischemic foci.
Over recent years in the medical image segmentation task CNNs have
achieved state-of-the-art results [30,31]. It is due to the convolution operation
and its weights capable of learning complicated structures and patterns at
multiple scales in the data. The U-shaped encoder-decoder CNN architecture
2D U-Net [32] has a wide application [33{35]. In [33], a self-adapting frame-
work where 2D U-Net is adopted to segment various organs is proposed. For
the analysis of volumetric images, 3D CNNs were introduced [36{38]. 3D U-
Net [36] shows better performance in comparison with 2D U-Net. In [39], a
slightly modied 3D U-Net is utilized for brain tumor segmentation in MRI
scans. In [40] DeepMedic CNN architecture [38] is used for stroke lesions seg-
mentation and post-processing techniques are investigated. In [33], cascaded
3D U-Net is proposed, which overcomes the disadvantage of 3D U-Net for
datasets with large image sizes, but it requires training two neural networks.
U-Net is often improved for a specic task using various architecture choices
(e. g., Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks [34, 41{43], attention mechanisms, and
computer vision transformers [44]).
In this work, we present a neural network algorithm for the volumetric
segmentation of acute ischemic stroke lesions on NCCT brain images. We
use a 3D CNN based on 3D U-Net architecture [36], which we modify with
residual connections and relatively new Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks [41].
To achieve better results, we implement robust pre-processing techniques,
a particular patch extraction strategy, and a weighted loss function, which
are aimed to alleviate the problem of class imbalance. We perform ve-fold
cross-validation and compare the results of experiments by measuring Dice,
sensitivity, specicity, and precision metrics.
In the rest of the paper, we describe the used dataset and the method
(including data pre-processing techniques and patches sampling strategy),
the neural network architecture, and training and testing procedures. In the
end, we summarize our work and discuss future plans.
1. Materials
The dataset used for our study contains volumetric non-contrast CT head
3scans of 81 patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. The CT images
were made by the Philips Ingenuity CT scanner and stored in medical DI-
COM format. The data were acquired from the International Tomography
Center SB RAS. All volumetric images have the same resolution of 512 512,
but a dierent number of slices varying from 306 to 505, depending on the
patient. For all images, slice thickness and spacing between slices are 1
and 0.5 mm, respectively. Also, the DICOM attribute pixel spacing, that
is, the physical distance in mm between pixel centers, ranges from 0.38 to
0.5 for dierent volumes. For each volumetric image, corresponding manual
segmentation is available. All segmentations were performed by two radiol-
ogy experts (specialists in magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray computed
tomography with 9-13 years experience, PhD in Radiology and Radiation
Therapy) using 3D Slicer [45]. It is worth mentioning that the number of
voxels corresponding to the area aected by acute ischemic stroke is 0.8% of
the total number of voxels in our dataset.
2. Methods
2.1. Data pre-processing
One crucial step in all deep-learning approaches is data pre-processing,
which ensures data consistency. Training CNN directly on data without
pre-processing leads to poor performance, as will be shown below. First,
the intensities of CT images were thresholded between 0 and 80 Hounseld
units [46]. This transformation eliminates most of the artifacts and high-
intensity tissues and remains visible such important parts of the brain as
soft tissue, white matter, and gray matter. Second, the skull and coil were
removed on each slice, leaving only the brain area on the CT image. This
transformation was performed using connected component analysis. In par-
ticular, extraction of the largest connected component, then assigning zero
values to pixels with the highest intensity, which correspond to the region of
the skull, and re-extraction of the largest connected component. Third, each
volume was normalized. We apply min-max normalization:
eX=X Xmin
Xmax Xmin
whereXminandXmaxare the minimum and the maximum intensity values
(X) of 3D image, respectively. Such a normalization rescales values to [0 ;1].
We also conducted an experiment applying standardization before min-max
normalization:

processing
whereis the mean and sis the standard deviation of the brain region.
Standardization was applied to each volumetric CT image of each patient
independently. Also, the non-brain region was set to 0. Such a technique
gives comparative intensity values in the brain area while invariant to the size
of the background part. Fourth, the volumes were cropped to the non-zero
region to dispose of a large uninformative background area. An example of
a pre-processed image is shown in Figure 1.
2.2. Patch-based approach
The main diculty related to 3D medical images is their large size, while
computing resources are always limited. For example, a CT scan from our
dataset has on average 512 512405 = 106168320 voxels (1.04 GB of
memory for 32-bit voxels), where 405 is the average number of slices for a
patient. It is worth noting that if the dataset is anisotropic, that is, the
resolution of dierent axes of an image is not the same, resizing methods
are not advisable. Dierent interpolation techniques can deform the physical
object and remove small details.
An optimal solution is to extract small parts, so-called patches, of 3D
images and use them as input to a neural network. We use the uniform sam-
pler, which extracts patches randomly from the whole volume with uniform
distribution, and the weighted sampler, which extracts patches from dierent
parts of the volume with a given non-uniform distribution. In our case, the
weighted sampler extracts a patch with its center in the area of the healthy
brain tissue with a probability of 0.5 and with its center in the area aected
by the stroke with a probability of 0.5. The probability of the background
5as a patch's center is set to 0. During one training epoch, the same number
of patches set to 32 are extracted for each patient. The patch size is set to
128128128.
2.3. Neural network architecture
Our deep learning algorithm builds on the encoder-decoder 3D U-Net [36]
convolutional neural network, which we specially modify for our objective.
The architecture of the neural network is shown in Figure 2. The input
size is 128128128. Each convolutional block of encoder and decoder
consists of two 3D convolutions with the size of kernel 3 33 and stride
of 111, where each of them is followed by a normalization layer and
activation function. We adopt LeakyReLU as an activation function since it
showed better results in our experiments in comparison with more commonly
used ReLU.
Fig. 2. CNN architecture
It is known that batch normalization [47] is strongly contingent on the
current batch statistics during training. The statistics can include some
noise, depending on the input examples. Therefore, it requires a suciently
large batch size and also a large size of the training set. However, due to the
high memory usage of 3D convolutions when employing large patches, we are
limited to a maximum batch size of 2. Thus, we apply instance normalization,
which solves this issue and shows better performance in our task than batch
normalization.
Trilinear upsampling is used instead of the more traditional transposed
convolution operator in the decoder part. In our research, we observe similar
6results, but the upsampling operator has no trainable parameters, so the
occupied memory can be reduced.
Residual connections mitigate the problem of vanishing and exploding
gradients when training deep neural networks. It was rst proposed in
ResNet [48]. We integrate this technique in each convolution block of the
contracting and expansive paths. The input is processed by 3D convolution
with a kernel size of 1 11, so the element-wise addition is possible. The
architecture diagram of the convolutional block of the encoder with resid-
ual connection is illustrated in Figure 3. The parameters in brackets after
Conv3D are the number of input channels, output channels, and kernel size.
The decoder block is similar except for trilinear upsampling that halves the
number of channels instead of 3D convolution that doubles the number of
channels, therefore we leave aside the decoder block image.
We insert the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) mechanism [41] in our CNN as
it shows strong performance in many computer vision tasks. It squeezes the
global spatial information into a channel descriptor, captures inter-dependen-
cies of all channels, and then recalibrates the feature maps to accentuate
relevant channels. In our case, it can help to learn where the aected area is
located by strengthening the informative features and suppressing the weak
ones.
Channel-wise global average pooling is applied to the input tensor T2
RCDHWof the SE block. Then the obtained vector U2RCis processed
by the excitation mechanism:
S=(W2(W1U)); S2RC
whereW12RC
rCis a linear layer reducing the number of dimensions of
the vector U,is the ReLU activation function, W22RCC
ris a linear
layer increasing the number of dimensions of the vector U,is the sigmoid
function, and ris a parameter. In the end, a channel-wise multiplication
between each element siof the vector Sand the input tensor Tis performed.
SE module is integrated into each convolutional block. Its particular location
is shown in Figure 3.
2.4. Training procedure
The obtained segmentation maps from the last CNN layer are transformed
by the sigmoid function to get the probabilities of classes. Then the neural
network weights are optimized using the sum of binary cross-entropy (BCE)
and soft Dice [49] loss functions. We also perform experiments with weighted

respectively.
2.5. Training, implementation and testing details
We train our networks using the following setting: the batch size of 2,
Adam optimizer [50] with the initial learning rate of 1E-4, which is reduced
by factor 2 every 5000 iterations until the learning rate is 1.25E-5, L2 weight
decay of 1E-5. The reduction ratio rof SE is 16. Each model was trained
for a total of 40000 iterations.
The proposed algorithm was implemented in Python 3.7 using PyTorch
1.12.0 machine learning framework. We also employ TorchIO 0.18.80 [51]
8Python library for data pre-processing. All trainings were conducted on
NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU with 16 GB of memory.
All patients were randomly split into ve parts, so all experiments were
performed using ve-fold cross-validation. To evaluate our results, we mea-
sure Dice similarity coecient (DSC), sensitivity, specicity, and precision
metrics, which are most signicant in medical image segmentation. The use
of these metrics, in addition to the main metric DSC, allows us to evaluate
aspects of the behavior of segmentation methods in conditions of unbal-
anced samples. Results are presented as mean standard deviation. DSC
is calculated similarly to the soft Dice loss but is not subtracted from 1 and
thresholded values are used instead of condence scores. To get the predicted
binary segmentation mask, the obtained probabilities were binarized accord-
ing to the threshold of 0.5. On the test set, patches were extracted across
a whole volume with an overlap of 25% over a grid. The predictions in the
overlapping areas were averaged.
3. Experiments and results
The quantitative comparison of our methods is presented in Table 1.
The pre-processing of the rst experiment included only thresholding of the
Hounseld units and the min-max normalization. Also, patches were derived

using the uniform sampler. The results of the second experiment show that
adding the robust pre-processing techniques, including selecting the brain
tissue and cutting to the non-zero region, increases DSC by 0.4%. The re-
stricted patch extraction method performed by the weighted sampler during
training improves performance by 3.6% of DSC and 4.9% of sensitivity. The
main proposed modications of 3D U-Net are residual connections and SE.
While the integration of the residual connections improves the DSC by 2.7%,
the consistent inserting of the SE modules gives a 3.8% of DSC increase, also
showing the promising sensitivity value of 0 :6890:059. The nal algorithm
conguration maintains the above-described improvements, while also stan-
dardization before min-max normalization and training using the weighted
loss function are performed. Such a conguration gives the best results,
0:6280:033 of DSC and 0 :6990:039 of sensitivity.
We also study how the patch overlapping size impacts the segmentation
accuracy when performing testing. Table 2 shows the quantitative assess-
ment with 25%, 50%, and 75% path overlapping using the nal algorithm
conguration. Although the overlapping of 75% gives the best results relying
on DSC, it reduces sensitivity, and the running time of the algorithm per one
patient is increased by 10 times.
We tried to insert in the training process various augmentation tech-
niques, such as random ane transformation, random ip, random elastic
deformation, random gamma intensity transformation, but it worsened the
performance of our algorithm.
Qualitative results are presented in Figure 4. Several axial plane slices of
the 3D images are from the validation set.
Conclusion
In this work, we presented and evaluated an automatic algorithm for
the segmentation of acute ischemic stroke lesion in non-contrast computed
tomography brain images. Our deep learning approach is based on the
3D U-Net convolutional neural network. As far as we know, no previ-
ous research has investigated the combination of 3D U-Net, Squeeze-and-
Excitation blocks, residual connections, specic patch extraction technique,
10and weighted loss function for solving the problem of acute ischemic stroke
lesion segmentation on NCCT images. We have experimentally shown that
the suggested pipeline for NCCT images segmentation, as compared to other
state-of-the-art methods, improved segmentation performance by implement-
ing robust pre processing techniques, Squeeze-and- Excitation blocks, and
residual connections. Also, specic patch extraction technique and weighted
loss function partially solved the class imbalance problem and increased the
segmentation accuracy. Our proposed model showed an average Dice of
0:6280:033, sensitivity of 0 :6990:039, specicity of 0 :99650:0016,
and precision of 0 :6190:036. High specicity values are caused by the
dominance of the negative class (non-aected tissue) over the positive class
(pathological area) in the sample. The method can be used by radiologists
in delineating between damaged and healthy brain tissue and deciding on
further treatment. In particular, it can help correct inaccuracies in their
stroke area predictions. Moreover, the method can assist doctors with the
large ow of patients by selecting cases with aected brain areas from normal
ones. Thus, doctors rst of all examine patients in need of emergency care.
It is also important to note that one of the main constraints of our objec-
Fig. 4. Qualitative segmentation results
11tive is the small amount of data in our dataset. It is with this we associate
the unusual obtained values of the specicity metric, and with the class im-
balance problem. In the future, we plan to explore other CNN architectures
and increase the dataset.
