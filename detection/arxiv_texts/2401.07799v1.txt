1. Introduction
TheKarsten-Wilczek(KW)action[1,2]isthesimplestimplementationofso-calledminimally
doubled fermions in lattice field theory. The action eliminates most of the spurious fermionic
degrees of freedom known as “doublers.” It reduces the number of doublers from fifteen to
one, leaving two mass-degenerate quark species, while explicitly preserving an ultra-local chiral
symmetry. In the case of degenerate up and down quarks this action allows the study of the chiral
transition without a rooting, which one is forced to employ with staggered quarks.
However,minimallydoubledfermionscomeataprice. Theactionbreaksthehypercubicsym-

These terms are manifestations of the anisotropy of the lattice breaking hypercubic symmetry
[3]. The counterterms 𝑆4𝑓and𝑆4𝑔act as anisotropy parameters of the fermion and gauge terms,
respectively. Toemphasizetheroleof 𝑆4𝑓,weexpressitsbareparameter 𝑑intermsoftheanisotropy
𝜉0=1+𝑑in our numerical work. Following the preferred axis 𝛼=0, we target a renormalization
anisotropy𝜉𝑓=1and find the bare anisotropy 𝜉0that restores isotropy.

tothoseof𝑐andthat𝑐canbeconsideredalmostindependentof 𝜉0[3]. Wequantifythisstatement
and explore a method for tuning the relevant parameter 𝑐and the bare anisotropy 𝜉0. Having an
efficient method will be critical eventually when tuning dynamical KW simulations [5].

of some KW fermions. These oscillations are related to fermion doubling [3]. Importantly, their
frequency is sensitive to the 𝑐parameter. Fermion partners can be identified by the spin-taste
structure of the KW action [8]. A relevant fermion pair is the 𝛾0and𝛾5channels. The correlators
for𝛾0and𝛾5are taken parallelto the preferred axis of the KW action, 𝛼=0in this case.
The correlator of 𝛾5perpendicular to𝛼=0in a spatial direction is needed for tuning 𝜉0. The
renormalized fermionic anisotropy is defined as the ratio of the perpendicular (spatial) mass of 𝛾5
to the parallel (temporal) mass: 𝜉𝑓=𝑚⊥/𝑚∥.
Theparallelcorrelatorfor 𝛾0exhibitsoscillationswhilethatof 𝛾5doesnot. Thetuningcriterion
for the𝑐parameter is where the frequency spectrum of the oscillations of the 𝛾0channel recovers
its tree-level form [3]. At the tuned 𝑐, the oscillation of the 𝛾0correlator is described by (−1)𝑛,

the tuning criterion is equivalently stated as where 𝜔𝑐=0and the beat vanishes. Fig. 1 shows an
example of correlators in the 𝛾0and𝛾5channels at detuned 𝑐where both the rapid oscillation and
the beat oscillation can be observed for 𝛾0. When we average over the symmetric halves of the 𝛾0

shape of the correlator. We tune 𝑐for a given𝜉0by scanning through 𝑐and extrapolating with a
linear fit to where 𝜔𝑐=0.
An immediate difficulty that arises in tuning 𝑐is the finite length of the lattice, which makes
fitting the frequency unreliable when the wavelength of the beat is greater than 𝑁𝑡in the relative
vicinity of tuned 𝑐. This can be ameliorated through the use of tiling gauge configurations. Tiling
means the gauge configurations are doubled (or quadrupled) to form a 𝑁3

live on an extended lattice without maintaining the long wave-length gauge fluctuations, which
would anyway be irrelevant for the divergent parts of the diagrams. Thus, when used properly,
tiling the stored gauge configurations increases the precision with which 𝜔𝑐is measured. Fig. 2
shows an example of 𝐶(𝑛)at detuned𝑐for three different amounts of tiling in the left plot, as well
as𝜔𝑐(𝑐)around tuned 𝑐for each level of tiling for comparison in the right plot. We use 4 ×and
occasionally 1×tiling throughout this study.
An example of finding the tuned 𝑐value is shown in the left plot of Fig. 3, where the
result is combined from linear fits on either side of the tuned 𝑐. An additional parameter for our
measurements is the number of stout smearing steps we apply. For any value of 𝜉0, the effect of
applying more smearing steps is a power law decrease in the magnitude of the tuned 𝑐value. An
exampleofthisisshownintherightplotofFig. 3. Weconsistentlyusefourstepsofstoutsmearing
throughout this study, the same smearing level that was used in the staggered simulation to create
the ensembles.
In this way, we tune 𝑐for any value of 𝜉0.𝜉0can then be tuned according to the desired
renormalizedanisotropy 𝜉𝑓. Sinceweperformmeasurementsonisotropicstaggeredconfigurations,
we tune by interpolating 𝜉𝑓(𝜉0)at tuned𝑐to𝜉𝑓(𝜉0)=1. An example of this is shown in the left

question naturally arises as to how accurately one needs to tune 𝑐and𝜉0, or how stable the result
is to slight mistunings. Thankfully, the results are quite stable, as the 𝜉𝑓(𝑐)function has vanishing
derivative (a maximum) near the tuned value.
Until this point, we have not mentioned the bare mass parameter of the KW action 𝑚0, which
determines the ground state masses of the pseudoscalar 𝛾0and𝛾5channels at tuned 𝑐and𝜉0. The

𝑀0, extracted using two different methods: one method utilizing a cosine fit to the beat frequency
component of the correlator, the other being a direct cosh fit to the correlator. The latter method
is only viable when the wavelength of the beat is large compared to the lattice, hence no beat is
apparently visible. The values of 𝑀0extracted from both methods are in agreement at the tuned
value of𝑐determined from where 𝜔𝑐=0. We can then conclude that the correct determination
of the value of 𝑀0is robust, in that the same value is obtained with different fit methods, but is
subordinate to a precise tuning of 𝑐as shown in Fig. 3.
Thus, the𝑐parameter determined from the condition of vanishing beat frequency in the 𝛾0
propagator is very close to the extrema of various renormalized quantities (e.g. 𝜉𝑓, meson mass).
The derivative of 𝐶-even quantities with respect to 𝑐are odd, and should vanish with a restored
symmetry. However, the use of e.g 𝑑𝑀5/𝑑𝑐=0for tuning of 𝑐is hindered by noise (see Fig. 5).
We find that the tuned value of 𝑐for a given𝜉0is very stable with respect to changes in
the physical mass of the 𝛾5channel𝑀5. Further, for fixed 𝑐and𝜉0, the renormalized fermionic
anisotropy𝜉𝑓is very stable with respect to changes in 𝑀5as well. These results are shown in Fig.
