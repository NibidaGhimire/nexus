ABSTRACT
Aims. The formation process of multiple populations in globular clusters is still up for debate. These populations are characterized by
dierent light-element abundances. Kinematic di erences between the populations are particularly interesting in this respect, because
they allow us to distinguish between single-epoch formation scenarios and multi-epoch formation scenarios. We derive rotation and
dispersion proÔ¨Åles for 25 globular clusters and aim to Ô¨Ånd kinematic di erences between multiple populations in 21 of them to
constrain the formation process.
Methods. We split red-giant branch (RGB) stars in each cluster into three populations (P1, P2, P3) for the type-II clusters and two
populations (P1 and P2) otherwise using Hubble photometry. We derive the global rotation and dispersion proÔ¨Åles for each cluster by
using all stars with radial velocity measurements obtained from MUSE spectroscopy. We also derive these proÔ¨Åles for the individual
populations of each cluster. Based on the rotation and dispersion proÔ¨Åles, we calculate the rotation strength in terms of ordered-over-
random motion (v=)HLevaluated at the half-light radius of the cluster. We then consistently analyse all clusters for di erences in the
rotation strength of their populations.
Results. We detect rotation in all but four clusters. For NGC 104, NGC 1851, NGC 2808, NGC 5286, NGC 5904, NGC 6093,
NGC 6388, NGC 6541, NGC 7078 and NGC 7089 we also detect rotation for P1 and /or P2 stars. For NGC 2808, NGC 6093 and
NGC 7078 we Ô¨Ånd di erences in (v=)HLbetween P1 and P2 that are larger than 1 . Whereas we Ô¨Ånd that P2 rotates faster than P1
for NGC 6093 and NGC 7078, the opposite is true for NGC 2808. However, even for these three clusters the di erences are still of
low signiÔ¨Åcance. We Ô¨Ånd that the strength of rotation of a cluster generally scales with its median relaxation time. For P1 and P2 the
corresponding relation is very weak at best. We observe no correlation between the di erence in rotation strength between P1 and
P2 and cluster relaxation time. The stellar radial velocities derived from MUSE data that this analysis is based on are made publicly
available.

1. Introduction
Classically, it is assumed that all stars in a globular cluster form
in the same molecular cloud and therefore are identical in age
and chemical abundances. The discovery of multiple popula-
tions of stars within globular clusters calls this into question.
These populations generally di er in light element abundances
(Carretta et al. 2009), but there is no evidence of age di erences
larger than0:1 Gyrs (Bastian & Lardo 2018; Martocchia et al.
2018). Using these abundance di erences, the stars of most clus-
ters (type-I clusters) can be separated into at least two popula-
tions. One population has a scaled solar metallicity, whereas the
other populations are always enriched in some light elements
(such as N or Na) and depleted in others (such as C or O). The

spread in light element abundances increase with cluster mass
(e.g. Carretta et al. 2010a; Milone et al. 2017). There is evidence
of metallicity spreads within some globular clusters for quite
some time (e.g. Carretta et al. 2010b). Milone et al. (2017) found
that for these clusters (type-II clusters) the two stellar popula-
tions are themselves split. Type-II clusters exhibit multiple sub-
giant and red giant branches, likely due to variations in heavy-
elements abundances. Pfe er et al. (2021) discussed several of
these clusters and argued that some of them are actually rem-
nants of nuclear star clusters. The occurrence of multiple popu-
lations is not limited to Galactic globular clusters, but they have
also been observed in clusters of other galaxies (e.g. Mucciarelli
et al. 2009; Milone et al. 2009; Dalessandro et al. 2016). Fur-
thermore, Martocchia et al. (2018) found that cluster age might
play a role in the onset of multiple populations, because they
did not detect light-element variations in clusters younger than
1:7 Gyr. However, by analyzing main sequence stars instead of
red giant branch stars Cadelano et al. (2022) found evidence for
multiple populations in the 1.5 Gyr old star cluster NGC 1783.

Several formation scenarios for multiple populations in glob-
ular clusters have been put forward, but each scenario comes
with its caveats (for a detailed review see Bastian & Lardo 2018).
There are two types of formation scenarios that we discuss here
brieÔ¨Çy. On the one hand, multi-epoch formation scenarios pro-
pose the formation of a second generation of stars that form
from gas polluted by primordial stellar sources, such as asymp-
totic giant branch stars or fast-rotating massive stars (Cottrell &
Da Costa 1981; Renzini 2013; Decressin et al. 2007a,b). On the
other hand, single-epoch formation scenarios suggest that some
stars accrete material when moving through the cluster center in
order to explain the observed spread in light-element abundances
(Bastian et al. 2013; Gieles et al. 2018).
The structural and kinematical di erences between the mul-
tiple populations of globular clusters today could give insights
on the formation process of these populations. Even though kine-
matic di erences were imprinted during the birth of each cluster,
and they diminish over time due to the interactions between stars
during cluster evolution, at least some clusters are still expected
to show measurable di erences in their present day kinematics
(Vesperini et al. 2013; H√©nault-Brunet et al. 2015; Tiongco et al.
2019). Di erences in the concentrations of stars between pop-
ulations at the time of formation would entail di erences in ra-
dial anisotropies over time (e.g. Richer et al. 2013; Bellini et al.
2015). Currently, a majority of globular clusters shows a higher
concentration of stars from the enriched population compared to
the pristine population (e.g. Dalessandro et al. 2019).
H√©nault-Brunet et al. (2015) showed that multi-epoch and
single-epoch formation scenarios result in very similar radial
anisotropy proÔ¨Åles, as they all assume that the second popu-
lations forms centrally concentrated relative to the Ô¨Årst popu-
lation. Therefore, anisotropy cannot be used to distinguish be-
tween these two types of scenarios. However, these two forma-
tion scenarios would entail di erent initial conditions for the
kinematics of these populations of stars. For multi-epoch forma-
tion scenarios, the rotation velocity is expected to be lower for
the non-enriched population compared to the N-enriched popu-
lation. On the contrary, for single-epoch formation scenarios, the
non-enriched population is expected to have a higher rotation
velocity than the N-enriched population (H√©nault-Brunet et al.
2015).Studies have been carried out to look for these di erences
in several globular clusters. In particular, Cordero et al. (2017)
were the Ô¨Årst to Ô¨Ånd rotational di erences between multiple
populations in a globular cluster for NGC 6205. Furthermore,
no kinematic di erences between populations have been found
for NGC 6121 (Cordoni et al. 2020), NGC 6838 (Cordoni
et al. 2020), NGC 6352 (Libralato et al. 2019), NGC 6205 and
NGC 7078 (Szigeti et al. 2021). For NGC 104, Milone et al.
(2018b) and Cordoni et al. (2020) found no di erences in the ro-
tation pattern between populations, but the latter did Ô¨Ånd that the
enriched population exhibits stronger anisotropy than the non-
enriched population. Cordoni et al. (2020) also found signiÔ¨Åcant
dierences in the phases of the rotation curves between popula-
tions for NGC 5904. However, Szigeti et al. (2021) could not Ô¨Ånd
signiÔ¨Åcant di erences in the rotation curves of this cluster, but
for NGC 5272 they found that the enriched population is rotat-
ing faster than the non-enriched population. Bellini et al. (2015)
found di erences in the radial anisotropy of NGC 2808 based on
proper motion data, but there is no analysis on radial rotation and
dispersion proÔ¨Åles yet for this cluster. For NGC 6362, Dalessan-
dro et al. (2021) found that the enriched population is rotating
faster than the non-enriched population. Kamann et al. (2020)
found similar results for NGC 6093 in that one of the enriched
populations they identiÔ¨Åed is rotating signiÔ¨Åcantly stronger than
the non-enriched population. The overall lack of uniformity and
agreement in these results emphasizes the need to further study
the kinematic di erences in multiple populations of globular
clusters.
In this work, we are following the approach described by
Kamann et al. (2020) to systematically study the kinematics for
25 galactic globular clusters and looking at di erences between
populations in 21 of them. We used radial velocities derived from
MUSE spectroscopy in combination with radial velocities from
Baumgardt & Hilker (2018) to extend the radial coverage of each
globular cluster, as described in Section 2. In Section 3 we de-
scribe our approach to split the stars of each cluster into two or
three populations based on photometric data. We use the stel-
lar radial velocities to create radial rotation and dispersion pro-
Ô¨Åles and derive parameters to characterize the global dynamics
of each cluster and of its stellar populations. We present the re-
sults of this analysis in Section 4 and conclude in Section 5.

2. Data
The globular clusters analyzed in this study were observed with
the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE, Bacon et al.
2010). MUSE is an integral Ô¨Åeld spectrograph mounted at UT4
of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) that has been in op-
eration since 2014. It features a wide-Ô¨Åeld mode with a Ô¨Åeld of
view of 1010at a sampling of 0 :200per pixel. Since 2019 MUSE
also possesses a narrow-Ô¨Åeld mode that covers a Ô¨Åeld of view of
7:5007:500at a sampling of 0 :025‚Äù per pixel. Both modes cover
a spectral range of 4750 √Ö  9350 √Ö with a corresponding spec-
tral resolution (R) of 1770 at 4750 √Ö and 3590 at 9350 √Ö. This
analysis is based on the MUSE Galactic globular cluster survey,
presented in Kamann et al. (2018). We are using all available
wide-Ô¨Åeld mode data for each globular cluster.
Basic data reduction is carried out using the o cial MUSE
pipeline (Weilbacher et al. 2020). The process of extracting spec-
tra of single stars from the resulting datacube is described in de-
tail by Kamann et al. (2018). In short, the program PAMPELMUSE
by Kamann et al. (2013) is used in combination with a reference
source catalog derived from HST photometry (Sarajedini et al.
2007; Anderson et al. 2008) to determine the position of each
resolved star in the MUSE data and to Ô¨Åt the MUSE PSF as a
function of wavelength to retrieve stellar spectra.
As described by Husser et al. (2016), the line-of-sight ve-
locity of each star is derived from its spectrum using cross-
correlation and a full spectral Ô¨Åtting approach. By cross-
correlating each spectrum against a set of template spectra, the
velocity vlos;ccis derived. The value of vlos;ccis then used as an
initial guess for the full spectral Ô¨Åtting method, described in de-
tail in Husser et al. (2016). Using a Levenberg-Marquardt algo-
rithm, the observed stellar spectra are Ô¨Åtted against the G√∂ttingen
Spectral Library (Husser et al. 2013) to derive the stellar metal-
licity [M /H], eective temperature Te, and radial velocity vlos;Ô¨Åt.
To retain a reliable data set, we are using a set of Ô¨Ålters on the
line-of-sight velocities derived from MUSE spectra. We are em-
ploying the reliability parameter Rtotal>0:8 described in Giesers
et al. (2019). It ensures that the value of vlos;ccis trustworthy
and consistent with vlos;Ô¨Åtand that the analyzed spectrum has a
signal-to-noise ratio of S=N>5. Additionally, we are remov-
ing stars that show temporal variations in their line-of-sight ve-
locities (e.g. binaries, pulsating stars) because in such cases the
measured velocities do not trace the gravitational potentials of
the host clusters. We use the method described by Giesers et al.
(2019) to derive the probability pvarthat any star that was ob-
served multiple times shows temporal variance in velocity. We
exclude all stars with pvar>0:5. To derive one value for the
line-of-sight velocity for each star, we average over MUSE ve-
locity measurements for stars that have been observed multiple
times. The stellar coordinates and averaged radial velocities used
for this analysis are listed in Table 2 which is only available in
electronic form at CDS and on the G√∂ttingen Research Online
repository, at XXX.
To increase the radial coverage of each cluster, we use stel-
lar velocities from Baumgardt & Hilker (2018) in addition to the
MUSE data. We match the Baumgardt & Hilker (2018) data to
HST photometry from Anderson et al. (2008), but the radial ve-
locities extend much further out than the HST data, so that most
radial velocities are not matched, but simply added to our data
set. Before combining, the respective systematic cluster velocity
is subtracted from the stellar velocities to minimize systematic
dierences between data sets. If a star is included in the sam-
ples of both MUSE and Baumgardt & Hilker (2018), we aver-Table 1. Overview of the number of stars per cluster and population.

age the stellar velocities from both sources. As shown by Ka-
mann et al. (2018), the stellar radial velocities from MUSE and
Baumgardt & Hilker (2018) agree in regions where they over-
lap. In the outer regions the completeness in terms of fraction
of stars with a radial velocity measure is signiÔ¨Åcantly smaller
than in the center since the Baumgardt & Hilker sample only
consists of giant branch stars. Because of energy equipartition,
which causes mass segregation, it is possible that this a ects the
velocity dispersion in the outer regions. However, using the for-
mula by Bianchini et al. (2016) we estimated that the di erence
between our MUSE sample and the Baumgardt & Hilker sample
in dispersion is .0:1 km /s based on the average masses of stars
in either sample, which is fully within the uncertainties of our
measurements.
3. Methods
3.1. Population Split
The separation into multiple populations is based on the chromo-
some map of each globular cluster. A chromosome map, which
was Ô¨Årst introduced by Milone et al. (2017), is a pseudo-color
color diagram using a combination of the HST Ô¨Ålters F275W,
F336W, F438W and F814W that splits the stars of a cluster into
its populations. We use photometry from the HST UV Globular
Cluster Survey (HUGS) from Piotto et al. (2015) and Nardiello
et al. (2018a) to create these maps, as explained in Latour et al.
(2019). We note that only RGB stars are included in the pop-
ulation analysis because the chromosome maps are tailored to
distinguish populations at this evolutionary phase.
Article number, page 3 of 27A&A proofs: manuscript no. paper
We need a consistent population separation because we want
to compare the kinematics of equivalent populations between
clusters. For type-I clusters, we use the fact that these clusters
always consist of one population with a scaled-solar abundance
(P1) and at least one additional population (P2) that di ers in
abundances to P1. Therefore, we follow the classiÔ¨Åcation by
Milone et al. (2017) and divide the stars of type-I clusters into
two groups using the chromosome map. The left panel of Fig. 1
shows our chromosome map and identiÔ¨Åed populations P1 and
P2 for NGC 2808. Stars from P1 are always found in the lower
part of the chromosome map around (0, 0) coordinate and, de-
pending on the cluster, partly extend horizontally, whereas P2
stars are located above P1 stars and extend diagonally toward
the top left.
Type-II clusters contain stars that are enhanced in some par-
ticular heavy-elements, such as barium and lanthanum, possibly
iron as well, compared to P1 and P2 stars (Marino et al. 2015).
These metal-enhanced stars are found on the reddest part of the
RGB in the CMD (see, e.g. Milone et al. 2017). For the Type-
II clusters, we consider these stars as a third population (P3).
The right panel in Fig. 1 shows our split into three populations
for the type-II cluster NGC 1851. The position of P1 and P2 for
NGC 1851 are similar to NGC 2808, but the third population has
a distinct position on the upper-right region of the chromosome
map.
We analyze 25 globular clusters, six of which are considered
type-II clusters. As brieÔ¨Çy mentioned in Section 1, some type-II
clusters might actually be the remnants of nuclear star clusters.
However, Pfe er et al. (2021) conclude that none of the type-
II clusters in our sample are remnants of nuclear star clusters.
Therefore, we treat them as globular clusters. A list of all clusters
with the number of stars used in the analysis of the global kine-
matics, and the number of stars per population, are shown in Ta-
ble 1. For NGC 1904, NGC 6266, NGC 6293 and NGC 6522 the
necessary HUGS photometric data to separate their RGB stars
into populations are not available. In these cases, we only derive
the global kinematic properties.
3.2. Kinematics
To study the kinematic di erences between populations, we Ô¨Årst
use the radial velocities of all stars in the cluster to derive its
global kinematics. Then we repeat the same procedure, includ-
ing only the RGB stars assigned to speciÔ¨Åc populations. From
the radial velocity data we create kinematic proÔ¨Åles and Ô¨Ånally
derive the ratio of ordered-over-random motion (v=)HLand a
proxy for the spin parameter R;HL. Both are evaluated at the
half-light radius to characterize the strength of rotation for all
clusters and each of their populations. We use a very similar ap-
proach as described in Kamann et al. (2020), but we repeat the
important assumptions and formulas below.
To create kinematic proÔ¨Åles, we need to derive the rotational
velocity vrotand the line-of-sight velocity dispersion losof each
cluster as a function of radius. To derive these parameters, we
employ the maximum-likelihood approach described in Kamann
et al. (2018). We assume that the line-of-sight stellar velocities
at any position ( x;y) may be approximated by a Gaussian with
mean vlosand standard deviation los. To account for the posi-
tion of each star within the cluster with respect to the rotation
axis of that cluster, we parameterize the line-of-sight velocities
according to vlos(r;)=vrot(r) sin( 0), where r=p
x2+y2is
the distance from the cluster center, 0is the angle of the clusterrotation axis, and =atan2( y;x) is the position angle measured
counter-clockwise from north to east.
As described in Kamann et al. (2020), we use parametric and
non-parametric models to analyze the stellar rotation velocities.
For the non-parametric approach, we simply bin velocities ra-
dially and derive the rotation velocity and velocity dispersion
for each bin. The parametric rotation proÔ¨Åle vrotwe employ is
characteristic for systems that have undergone violent relaxation

We di er in our approach to handling non-member stars com-
pared to Kamann et al. (2020). They used cluster membership
probabilities that were derived from stellar metallicities and line-
of-sight velocities, as described by Kamann et al. (2016). We
cannot take the same approach, because we do not have metal-
licities for the additional Baumgardt & Hilker stars. We modiÔ¨Åed
the method of membership determination in order to have con-
sistent membership probabilities for stars from both data sets. In
particular, we introduce a prior on the membership probability
for each star pithat is related to the stellar surface density of the
cluster(ri) at the radial distance riof that star from the cluster
center according to
pi(r)=(ri)
(ri)+ffg; (3)
where ffgmeasures the fractional contribution of foreground
sources to the observed source density. To describe the stellar
surface density of each cluster, we use the LIMEPY models de-
scribed in Gieles & Zocchi (2015), with parameters for each
cluster as determined by de Boer et al. (2019). For NGC 6441
and NGC 6522 de Boer et al. (2019) do not provide any param-
eters for these models, so we chose to use King models (King
1966) with the necessary parameters of central concentration and
core radius taken from Harris (1996, 2010 edition). We modiÔ¨Åed
the likelihood function Liof each star ito not solely be based on
the likelihood of the rotation and dispersion model Lcl;i, but to

tion of each cluster. The foreground likelihood for each star Lfg;i

NGC 2808
Fig. 2. Rotation and dispersion proÔ¨Åles for NGC 2808 and each of its populations. The rotation proÔ¨Åles for each population are shown on the left,
whereas the dispersion proÔ¨Åles are shown on the right. In the center, the angle of rotation is shown. The continuous proÔ¨Åles (solid lines) and binned
proÔ¨Åles (symbols) shown here are each determined as Ô¨Åts on single stars, and the shaded area represents the 1 uncertainty of each continuous
proÔ¨Åle and rotation angle. The dotted vertical line in each radial proÔ¨Åle illustrates the half-light radius of NGC 2808.
To maximize the likelihood of our model given the data,
we use the Python package emcee from Foreman-Mackey et al.
(2013), which is an implementation of the invariant Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler by Goodman &
Weare (2010). Thinning the samples of each parameter by 16
ensures that the Ô¨Ånal set of values for each parameter is again
uncorrelated. We calculate the best Ô¨Åt parameters as the median
of each distribution of thinned samples. In accordance with the
standard deviation of a Gaussian, the lower and upper uncertain-
ties of each Ô¨Åtted parameter are calculated using the 16th and
84th percentile of the corresponding distribution. However, in
some cases, the distribution of the maximum rotation velocity
vmaxmay have a peak at zero and drop towards zero for larger
values of vmax. In those cases we give an upper limit on the ro-
tation velocity that corresponds to the 95th percentile of the dis-
tribution and the rotation angle cannot be calculated. The actual
Ô¨Åtting procedure for each cluster is performed as follows:
1. The parametric models are Ô¨Åtted simultaneously to the line-
of-sight velocities for the overall cluster including the Baum-
gardt & Hilker data, with the systematic velocity vsys, rota-
tion amplitude vmax, rotation angle 0,rpeak,max,a0andffg
as free parameters. The corresponding priors for each param-
eter are presented in Table A.1 with the subscript ‚Äôo‚Äô. The
priors on rpeakanda0were chosen to exclude unphysical so-
lutions for either small or large values of these parameters.
2. The parametric models are Ô¨Åtted independently for each pop-
ulation of that cluster with vsys,vmax,0,rpeak,max,a0as
free parameters. The fraction of foreground stars ffgfrom the
parametric Ô¨Åt of the overall cluster is used to derive member-
ship probabilities for each star that are kept Ô¨Åxed. The priors
of all Ô¨Åtted parameters are listed in Table A.1 with the sub-
script ‚Äôp‚Äô. The radial extent of the separation in multiple pop-ulations is limited by the availability of HUGS photometry
from Piotto et al. (2015) and Nardiello et al. (2018a), which
is why the radial coverage of the velocity and dispersion pro-
Ô¨Åles for each population is limited compared to the overall
cluster. Therefore, we chose to apply strict priors on rpeak
anda0based on the distributions of samples from the para-
metric Ô¨Åt of the overall cluster. We chose to take a similar ap-
proach on vsys, since the systematic velocity should not vary
between populations. Furthermore, we applied a soft prior in
vmax, that is based on the distributions of samples from the
parametric Ô¨Åt of the overall cluster for vmaxandmax, and
the escape velocity vescof that cluster, where we used values
for the escape velocities from Baumgardt & Hilker (2018).
3. The non-parametric model is Ô¨Åtted to the overall cluster and
each of its populations with vsys,vmax,0andlosas free pa-
rameters per radial bin. The priors for each parameter are
listed in Table A.2. Again, we chose to limit the system-
atic velocity vsysbased on the results from the corresponding
parametric Ô¨Åt. Additionally, we applied a prior on 0based
on the value of 0from the corresponding parametric Ô¨Åt to
ensure that the non-parametric proÔ¨Åles are consistent with
the parametric proÔ¨Åles. We note that this approach introduces
bias against depicting changes in the rotation axis with ra-
dius.
As described above, we only use the additional radial ve-
locities from Baumgardt & Hilker (2018) in the analysis of the
overall cluster, but not its populations, because we are unable
to split those stars into populations. Nonetheless, the inclusion
of this data is still important, since the strict priors on rpeakand
a0for the population Ô¨Åt are solely based on the Ô¨Åt of the whole
cluster. Without the addition of that data, we would not be able
Article number, page 5 of 27A&A proofs: manuscript no. paper
to reliably derive these parameters for most clusters, as a result
of the smaller radial range.
To quantify the e ect of rotation, we calculate the ratio of
ordered-over-random (v=)HLmotion for each population in all
clusters. Classically, this ratio is deÔ¨Åned as the ratio between
the maximum rotation velocity to the central velocity dispersion.
However, because of the weaknesses of this approach mentioned
by Binney (2005), we follow the deÔ¨Ånition of (v=)HLby Cap-
pellari et al. (2007):

where rHLis the half-light radius of each cluster. Emsellem et al.
(2007) highlighted a potential shortcoming of using (v=)HLto
characterize velocity Ô¨Åelds, in that structurally di erent velocity
Ô¨Åelds can result in very similar values of (v=)HL. To address this
issue, they introduced R;HLas an alternative, which is a proxy
for the spin parameter of the velocity Ô¨Åeld:

We calculate both parameters based on the rotation and disper-
sion proÔ¨Åles described in Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 for each cluster and its
populations to quantify kinematical di erences between clusters
and populations. For these calculations, we use the values of the
half-light radius rHLfrom Harris (1996, 2010 edition). For each
cluster and all of its populations, we use the global density pro-
Ô¨Åles(r). For some clusters, the radial rotation proÔ¨Åles do not
extend beyond the half-light radius. This could introduce some
bias to the values of (v=)HLandR;HL. However, as described
earlier, we apply a strict prior on the radial scales of the rotation
and dispersion proÔ¨Åles for each population based on the overall
proÔ¨Åle. Therefore, when we calculate (v=)HLandR;HLbased
on the MCMC results of the radial rotation and dispersion pro-
Ô¨Åles, we expect that any bias that may occur is correctly reÔ¨Çected
in our uncertainties of these parameters. The kinematical model
we employ to derive the rotation and dispersion proÔ¨Åles is not
sensitive to structural di erences between velocity Ô¨Åelds of dif-
ferent clusters. Therefore, we expect that (v=)HLandR;HLare
qualitatively the same for each cluster with this model.
4. Results
4.1. Global Kinematics
Figure 2 shows the radial rotation and dispersion proÔ¨Åles for
NGC 2808. In the top panel of this Ô¨Ågure, the global proÔ¨Åles
for the cluster are presented, where the outermost radial velocity
data points are from the stars in the Baumgardt & Hilker (2018)
catalog. In the lower panels of this Ô¨Ågure, the corresponding
proÔ¨Åles are shown for each population. The continuous proÔ¨Åles
(solid lines) and binned proÔ¨Åles (symbols) shown here are each
determined as Ô¨Åts on single stars, and the shaded area represents
the 1uncertainty of each continuous proÔ¨Åle and rotation angle.
The dashed line indicates the value of the half-light radius of this
cluster (Harris 1996, 2010 edition). The proÔ¨Åles for the other 24
globular clusters and their corresponding chromosome maps are
displayed in Figures A.1 to A.24 in the appendix. The binned
proÔ¨Åles highlight again that the radial extent of our data is lim-
ited to the center of each cluster. This could bias our ability to
detect di erences in kinematics between populations in the outerregions of the cluster. However, based on the work of H√©nault-
Brunet et al. (2015) we expect to Ô¨Ånd the largest di erences be-
tween populations around the half-light radius of each cluster.
Even closer to the center, di erences should still be detectable.
Nevertheless, the extension of our work to the outskirts of the
clusters appears as a promising opportunity for future studies.
Overall, the binned non-parametric proÔ¨Åles are in good agree-
ment with the continuous parametric proÔ¨Åles. The largest dis-
crepancies between these types of proÔ¨Åles are found close to the
center, where the binned proÔ¨Åles indicate a rise in rotation veloc-
ity for some clusters (e.g. NGC 1904 and NGC 7089). Since the
uncertainties of the binned rotation proÔ¨Åles are also the largest
close to the center, it is uncertain whether this is a signiÔ¨Åcant
eect. We stress that the binned proÔ¨Åles are only used for visu-
alization purposes and all following analyses are based on the
parametric proÔ¨Åles. As mentioned in Sec. 3.2 the radial extent
for the P1, P2 and P3 proÔ¨Åles is limited, which is revealed by
the binned proÔ¨Åles. We used priors on the rpeakthat are based
on the parametric Ô¨Åt including all stars in the cluster. We use
the parametric rotation and dispersion proÔ¨Åles to derive (v=)HL
andR;HL, according to Eq. 6 and Eq. 7, for each cluster and
its populations. Both of these values are integrals of these pro-
Ô¨Åles up to the half-light radius of each cluster, which makes both
parameters robust against changes in rpeak, as shown by Kamann
et al. (2020). The Ô¨Åtted parameters and the values of (v=)HLand
R;HLfor the populations of all clusters are listed in Table A.3.
Since the value of vsysis close to zero for each cluster and its
populations, it is not important for the subsequent analysis and
is not discussed further.
In Fig. 3 we show our values of (v=)HLas a function of
the median relaxation time Trhof each cluster. The values for
Trhare from (Harris 1996, 2010 edition), see Tab. A.3. For the
global kinematics of the clusters, we Ô¨Ånd that there is a relation-
ship between (v=)HLand the median relaxation time, in that for
clusters with higher relaxation times we tend to get higher values
in(v=)HL. In particular, for NGC 362, NGC 6397, NGC 6522
and NGC 6681 we do not Ô¨Ånd a signiÔ¨Åcant sign of rotation and
all of them have relaxation times of log10(Trh=Gyr)<8:95. Sim-
ilar relations between cluster rotation and relaxation time have
been found by Kamann et al. (2018), Bianchini et al. (2018)
and Sollima et al. (2019). This is to be expected if we assume
that globular clusters are imprinted at birth with the angular mo-
mentum of their parent molecular clouds. Over time, this angu-
lar momentum is dissipated outwards through two-body relax-
ation. In fact, numerical simulations show that star clusters can
be rotating shortly after their birth (Mapelli 2017; Bekki 2019)
and that the strength of rotation declines over time (Lah√©n et al.
2020). For several clusters in our sample, the relaxation times
provided by Sollima & Baumgardt (2017) di er from those by
Harris (1996, 2010 edition). If we use the values provided by
Sollima & Baumgardt (2017), we Ô¨Ånd a similar relation with our
values of (v=)HLbut the correlation is weaker.
We Ô¨Ånd a linear relation between (v=)HLandR;HLfor all clus-
ters and populations. This is shown in Figure A.25 in the ap-
pendix. We Ô¨Ånd that the constant of proportionality is 0:8 for
all cases. Since our kinematic model is not sensitive to structural
dierences in the velocity Ô¨Åeld of a cluster it is expected that
(v=)HLandR;HLare qualitatively the same. In the following,
we only use (v=)HLto describe the kinematics of clusters and
populations.

4.2. Differences between P1 and P2
To analyze P1 and P2 for di erences in their kinematics, we
compare the distributions of (v=)HLderived from the thinned
MCMC samples for vmax,0,rpeak,maxanda0using Eq. 1, Eq.
2 and Eq. 6. Figure 4 shows these distributions for all popula-
tions of each cluster. The distributions for P1 and P2 are shown
in green and orange, respectively. For NGC 1904, NGC 6266,
NGC 6293, and NGC 6522, only the distribution for all stars, in
gray, is plotted because there is no separation into populations
for these clusters.
For NGC 362, NGC 3201, NGC 6218, NGC 6254,
NGC 6397, NGC 6624, NGC 6656, NGC 6681, NGC 6752 and
NGC 7099 we Ô¨Ånd that the distributions of (v=)HLfor P1 and
P2 shown in Figure 4 are consistent with zero. In these cases, we
are unable to detect rotation for either population (see Table A.3
and the corresponding rotation proÔ¨Åles in the appendix). Based
on our analysis, we Ô¨Ånd that our ability to detect rotation for any
population depends mainly on two factors. First, the uncertain-
ties of our analysis increase substantially for clusters with less
than200 stars per population (e.g. NGC 3201 and NGC 6218),
resulting in a very broad distribution of (v=)HL. Second, if a
cluster is slowly rotating ( (v=)HL.0:05), it is challenging to
constrain the rotation of its populations given our uncertainties.
When both factors are present, like in the cases of NGC 6397
and NGC 6752, our analysis only provides broad upper limits on
the rotation strength of each population.
For NGC 104, NGC 1851, NGC 2808, NGC 5286,
NGC 5904, NGC 6093, NGC 6388, NGC 6541, NGC 7078 and
NGC 7089 we are able to detect rotation for P1 or P2. All of
these clusters fulÔ¨Åll the condition (v=)HL&0:05. NGC 6656 is
the only other cluster in our sample that also fulÔ¨Ålls this con-
dition, but we are unable to detect rotation in P1 and P2 be-
cause its populations contain fewer than 200 stars. This shows
that the global rotation of the cluster strongly a ects the rota-
tion of the individual populations, as expected. Based on the dis-
tributions of (v=)HLshown in Fig. 4, we Ô¨Ånd kinematic di er-
ences between P1 and P2 that are signiÔ¨Åcant above a 1 -level for
NGC 2808, NGC 6093 and NGC 7078. For NGC 6093 and NGC
7078 we Ô¨Ånd that P2 rotates faster than P1 at a conÔ¨Ådence level
of 1:5and 2:2respectively, whereas P2 rotates slower than
P1 in NGC 2808 at a conÔ¨Ådence level of 1 :8. For NGC 104,NGC 1851, NGC 5286, NGC 5904, NGC 6388, NGC 6541 and
NGC 7089 the strength of rotation of P1 is consistent with that
of P2.
Furthermore, we investigated whether the strength of rota-
tion of P1 and P2 or their di erence can be related to the relax-
ation time of the corresponding cluster. In the top and middle
panel of Fig. 5 the values of (v=)HLare plotted against the re-
laxation time of the corresponding cluster for P1 and P2. For
both P1 and P2, the strength of rotation only depends weakly on
the relaxation time, if there is any correlation at all. Moreover,
we do not see a correlation between the di erence of rotation
strength between P1 and P2 with relaxation time, which is illus-
trated in the bottom panel of Fig. 5. However, the signiÔ¨Åcance of
these results should be taken with a grain of salt, since we only
Ô¨Ånd di erences above the 1 -level for three clusters.
In addition, we looked into possible connections of our kine-
matic di erences with the radial concentration of P1 and P2.
In fact, both NGC 6093 and NGC 7078 have been reported to
contain a more centrally concentrated P1 compared to P2 ac-
cording to Dalessandro et al. (2018) and Larsen et al. (2015),
respectively. For both clusters, we Ô¨Ånd that P1 rotates slower
than P2. However, Nardiello et al. (2018a) Ô¨Ånd no di erence in
concentration between P1 and P2 for NGC 7078. For NGC 104
(Milone et al. 2018a; Cordoni et al. 2020, e.g.) and NGC 2808
(Dalessandro et al. 2019) P2 was found to be more centrally con-
centrated than P1. Whereas we do not Ô¨Ånd signiÔ¨Åcant kinematic
dierences between P1 and P2 for NGC 104, we Ô¨Ånd that P1
rotates faster than P2 for NGC 2808. Overall, this could hint at
a connection between kinematic di erences and the radial con-
centration of multiple populations in globular clusters, so that a
population more centrally concentrated would rotate less. How-
ever, since we only Ô¨Ånd kinematic di erences in three clusters
and the information on the concentrations is only available for a
small subset of our sample of clusters, additional data are needed
to investigate this further. Furthermore, the observations for e.g.
NGC 5272 (Lee & Sneden 2021), NGC 6205 (Johnson & Pila-
chowski 2012; Cordero et al. 2017) and NGC 6362 (Dalessandro
et al. 2019, 2021) do not support this trend in our data that more
centrally concentrated populations rotate less.
4.3. Additional Population in Type-II Clusters
The distributions of (v=)HLfor type-II clusters are also shown
in Figure 4, where P1, P2 and P3 are shown in green, orange
and purple respectively. For four of the six type-II clusters in
our sample, we did not detect rotation in P3. For NGC 362,
NGC 6656 and NGC 7089 this is most likely due to the low
number of stars in P3 as discussed previously. For NGC 6388 P3
is populated well, but the global rotation of the cluster is very
low. For NGC 1851 and NGC 5286 we detect rotation in P1, P2
and P3. For NGC 1851 we Ô¨Ånd that the distribution of (v=)HL
for P3 is very similar to that of P1 and P2, whereas for NGC
5286, there might be a hint of P3 rotating faster than P1 and P2.
However, the observed di erence in (v=)HLis still within the
1uncertainty interval, so further data are needed to draw any
solid conclusions. In particular, these results also do not give any
clear hints on other formation scenarios for type-II clusters.

on the rotation strength.
ter and P1 are consistent, the distribution of samples for rpeakof
P2 peaks at a much smaller value, which is also apparent in the
radial rotation proÔ¨Åle in Fig. A.8 in the appendix. Furthermore,
the distribution of rpeakfor P2 is asymmetric and there is a strong
anti-correlation between rpeakandvmax. This causes the asymme-
try of (v=)HLin Fig. 4 for P2 of this cluster. As discussed in Sec.
4.1 the value of (v=)HLis generally robust to changes in rpeak.
However, in this case the value of rpeakfor P2 is very close to the
center of that cluster, and it seems worthwhile to Ô¨Ånd out whether
this has a signiÔ¨Åcant e ect on our results. If we apply a uniform
prior on rpeakfor P2, we Ô¨Ånd that the di erence between P1 and
P2 in (v=)HLis even larger and the asymmetry in the distribu-
tion of (v=)HLvanishes. If we Ô¨Åx the value of rpeakfor P2 to
that obtained for the whole cluster, the asymmetry also vanishes,
but in this case (v=)HLis consistent with that value for P1. This
cluster was already analyzed for kinematic di erences between
populations based on MUSE data, with a very similar approach
to the one presented here by Kamann et al. (2020). They did not
Ô¨Ånd this peculiar behavior of P2 for that cluster, because they
used a di erent population split than the one used here. Notably,
they also used individual population density proÔ¨Åles when cal-
culating (v=)HLfor their populations and not the global den-
sity proÔ¨Åle of that cluster. Kamann et al. (2020) split the cluster
in three populations, where our P1 is consistent with their pri-mordial population and our P2 includes their intermediate and
extreme populations. If we average their values of (v=)HLfor
the intermediate and extreme population, the result is consistent
with the value of (v=)HLthey obtained for the primordial pop-
ulation. If we consider that Kamann et al. (2020) Ô¨Åxed the radial
scale of each population, our results are consistent with theirs in
that we do not Ô¨Ånd signiÔ¨Åcant kinematic di erences between P1
and P2 if the radial scale is Ô¨Åxed to that of the global proÔ¨Åle.
However, there is no physical reason for why the radial scale of
P2 cannot be di erent to that of P1.
4.4.2. NGC 2808 & NGC 7078
For NGC 2808 and NGC 7078 we Ô¨Ånd di erences above the
1-level in (v=)HLand the rotation proÔ¨Åles of their popu-
lations, whereas the dispersion proÔ¨Åles do not di er signiÔ¨Å-
cantly. For NGC 7078 we observe that P2 rotates faster than P1.
Qualitatively, this behavior is similar to that of NGC 6093 and
NGC 6205, where di erences of this type between similar pop-
ulations have also been reported by Kamann et al. (2020) and
Cordero et al. (2017) respectively. For NGC 2808 we Ô¨Ånd the
opposite in that P1 rotates faster than P2.

chromosome maps and their kinematic di erences further for

NGC 2808 and NGC 7078, we decided to reiterate the analy-
sis with di erent population splits. Incidentally, the structure of
the chromosome maps of these clusters allows us to distinguish
between four populations (P1, P2‚Äô, P3‚Äô and P4‚Äô) for NGC 2808
(Milone et al. 2015; Latour et al. 2019) and three populations
(P1, P2‚Äô and P3‚Äô) for NGC 7078 (Nardiello et al. 2018b). Com-
pared to Milone et al. (2015) our P2‚Äô, P3‚Äô and P4‚Äô in NGC 2808
are equivalent to their populations C, D and E, while our P1‚Äô is
their populations A and B combined. For NGC 7078, our P2‚Äô is
equivalent to population B by Nardiello et al. (2018b), whereas
our P1‚Äô corresponds to their populations A and D and our pop-
ulation P3‚Äô is equal to their populations C and E. We do not
split P1‚Äô for both clusters and P3‚Äô for NGC 7078 any further
to ensure that there are still enough stars per population to get
meaningful results from our analysis. These populations accord-
ing to our splitting are shown in the chromosome maps in the
upper panels of Fig. 6, whereas the distributions of (v=)HLfor
these populations are depicted in the lower panels of that Ô¨Ågure.
For NGC 2808 we Ô¨Ånd that P2‚Äô, P3‚Äô and P4‚Äô do not di er in their
rotation signiÔ¨Åcantly, but the di erence between these three pop-
ulations and P1‚Äô is larger than 1 . For NGC 7078 the value of
(v=)HLof P3‚Äô stars is consistent with that of P1‚Äô and P2‚Äô stars,
but the di erence between P1‚Äô stars and P2‚Äô is larger than 1 .
Therefore, we do not Ô¨Ånd a general trend of (v=)HLalong these
populations.
NGC 7078 has been analyzed for kinematic di erences in
populations by Szigeti et al. (2021). They used high precision
radial velocity data from the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey for
138 stars in NGC 7078 to measure its rotation amplitude as a
function of position angle for the whole cluster and two popu-
lations that were identiÔ¨Åed based on single element abundance
changes. They derived the angular rotation proÔ¨Åle of NGC 7078by splitting the cluster into two halves through the cluster center.
This line of separation is rotated in small angular increments, and
the di erence in mean radial velocity Vbetween both halves is
calculated at each step. If the cluster is rotating, the relation be-
tween velocity di erence Vand position angle relative to the
rotation axis isV=2vrotsin(). The global rotation am-
plitude and rotation angle that they Ô¨Ånd agree with our values
forvmaxand0for the whole cluster. Furthermore, they found no
kinematic di erence between their two populations, which is in
contrast to our results. Their method may only be applied to a
fully sampled area that is symmetric with respect to the position
angle. To ensure that our data comply with those restrictions, we
Ô¨Ålter our stars to make the covered area of the cluster circular.
If we apply their method to our Ô¨Åltered data for P1 and P2, we
Ô¨Ånd rotation amplitudes and rotation angles that are consistent
with our radial rotation curves for P1 and P2. The corresponding
angular rotation proÔ¨Åles and the spatial coverage of the cluster
are shown in Fig. A.26. In particular, we still Ô¨Ånd kinematic dif-
ferences between P1 and P2. One striking di erence between
their data and ours is that we have 390 and 697 stars in P1 and
P2, compared to their 33 and 49 stars in those populations. To
investigate this further, we decreased the number of stars by ran-
domly sampling from P1 and P2 and then applied their method
again. Figure A.27 shows three of these angular rotation proÔ¨Åles
and the spatial coverage of the cluster. We Ô¨Ånd that with so few
stars, this method results in a wide range of fundamentally dif-
ferent proÔ¨Åles, presumably because the method is very sensitive
to single stars. Probably the uncertainties of the di erential rota-
tion proÔ¨Åles are underestimated because the strong correlations
between di erent values in those proÔ¨Åles are generally not taken
into account. Together with our much larger sample of analyzed
stars, this could be the cause for the discrepancies between our
results and those from Szigeti et al. (2021).
NGC 2808 has not been analyzed for di erences in its ra-
dial rotation and dispersion proÔ¨Åles yet, but Bellini et al. (2015)
found di erences in the radial anisotropy proÔ¨Åles for this cluster,
by using proper motion data. Given that this cluster shows kine-
matic di erences using both radial velocities and proper motion
data, it would be very interesting to combine both data sets and
analyze the 3D stellar velocities of this cluster for di erences
between multiple populations.
4.4.3. NGC 104 & NGC 5904
Neither Milone et al. (2018b), nor Cordoni et al. (2020), Ô¨Ånd
dierences in the rotation amplitude between the populations of
NGC 104, which agrees with our results. For NGC 5904 Cordoni
et al. (2020) do not observe any di erences in rotation amplitude,
but they do Ô¨Ånd di erences in the phase of their rotation curves.
These phase di erences translate to a di ering angle of rotation.
We do not Ô¨Ånd any signiÔ¨Åcant di erences in rotation amplitudes
for NGC 5904 either, but we also do not Ô¨Ånd a signiÔ¨Åcant di er-
ence in the angle of rotation between P1 and P2.
4.5. Random Sampling of the Chromosome Map
To further analyze the solidity of our results for NGC 2808,
NGC 6093 and NGC 7078 and to evaluate our uncertainty es-
timations, we randomly sampled the chromosome maps of these
clusters to create random populations P1 and P2. To ensure com-
parability to the original population split, we used the same num-
ber of stars per population as in the original separations (see Ta-
ble 1). To achieve statistically relevant results, we created 100

Fig. 6. Top : Chromosome maps of NGC 2808 and NGC 7078, with additional population splits. For NGC 2808 the original P2 is split into three
subpopulations (P2‚Äô, P3‚Äô and P4‚Äô), whereas P2 of NGC 7078 is split into two subpopulations (P2‚Äô and P3‚Äô) according to the respective morphology
of the chromosome maps. Bottom : Distributions of samples of (v=)HLfor NGC 2808 and NGC 7078 for the overall cluster and each of their

random population pairs for each cluster. We calculated the ro-
tation and dispersion proÔ¨Åles and derived (v=)HLfor each of
these random populations, as described in Sec. 3.2. As a result,
we calculate 100 values of (v=)HLfor each population of each
cluster, which are shown in the upper panels of Fig. 7. It is ap-
parent that the distributions for P1 and P2 for each cluster have
the same median value. This shows that, on average, we do not
Ô¨Ånd kinematic di erences when randomly sampling the chro-
mosome map. We also Ô¨Ånd that the distributions of (v=)HLob-
tained with the random sampling are broader for smaller num-
bers of stars per population, as expected. In the lower panels
of Fig. 7 we show the di erences of (v=)HLbetween P1 and
P2 obtained from the random sampling. As expected, these dis-
tributions are centered around zero. We also indicated the ob-
served di erences for NGC 2808, NGC 6093 and NGC 7078 in
red. The observed di erences lie outside the 1 -regions of the
distributions, which supports the solidity of our uncertainty esti-
mations and indicates that the kinematic di erences that we Ô¨Ånd
for NGC 2808, NGC 6093 and NGC 7078 are truly connected to
the populations deÔ¨Åned in the chromosome maps.5. Conclusion & Outlook
We created and analyzed the rotation and dispersion proÔ¨Åles of
25 Galactic globular clusters in the search for kinematic di er-
ences between di erent populations within each cluster. Based
on these kinematic proÔ¨Åles, we derived the rotation strength in
terms of the ratio of ordered-over-random motion (v=)HL, eval-
uated at the half-light radius, for each cluster and its populations
to quantify kinematic di erences. For NGC 362, NGC 6397,
NGC 6522 and NGC 6681 we Ô¨Ånd no signiÔ¨Åcant global rotation
when using all stars in these clusters. For NGC 104, NGC 1851,
NGC 2808, NGC 5286, NGC5904, NGC 6093, NGC 6388,
NGC 6541, NGC 7078 and NGC 7089 we are able to detect rota-
tion in at least one of their populations. For three clusters we Ô¨Ånd
dierences above the 1 level: For NGC 6093 and NGC 7078
we Ô¨Ånd that P2 stars rotate faster than P1 stars, whereas we Ô¨Ånd
the opposite for NGC 2808, where P1 stars rotate faster than P2
stars.
Our results do not give a clear hint on the formation sce-
nario of multiple populations in globular clusters. We Ô¨Ånd sup-
port for both multi-epoch and single-epoch formation scenarios
in our data. For multi-epoch formation scenarios, we expect to
Ô¨Ånd that P2 rotates faster than P1, which matches our results
for NGC 6093 and NGC 7078. Assuming a single-epoch forma-

tion scenario, it follows that P1 rotates faster than P2, which is
what we Ô¨Ånd for NGC 2808. However, the kinematic di erences
that we Ô¨Ånd are still relatively uncertain at conÔ¨Ådence levels of
.2, so further data are needed for a deÔ¨Ånitive answer. We Ô¨Ånd
further support for both scenarios if we consider clusters with
kinematical variations between P1 and P2 below the 1 -level.
While we Ô¨Ånd that the rotation strength of each cluster is pos-
itively correlated with median relaxation time, the correlation
between relaxation time and the rotation strength of P1 or P2 is
weak at best, and we do not see a correlation of the kinemati-
cal di erence between P1 and P2 with relaxation time. Based on
our analysis, neither of the two types of formation scenarios for
multiple populations in globular clusters is favored. Bastian &
Lardo (2018) discussed that none of the formation scenarios put
forward to date is able to explain all the observations. It is also
possible that the formation of multiple populations does not af-
fect the rotation of either population in a way that we are able to
observe. However, it would be very interesting to see what pri-
mordial di erences between P1 and P2 are consistent with the
dierences between those populations that we Ô¨Ånd.
To get a better understanding of the formation scenarios of
multiple populations and their kinematics in general, there are
several problems worth addressing. For many clusters in our
sample, we were unable to detect rotation for P1 or P2. How-
ever, since most clusters are rotating overall, we suspect that at
least one population should be rotating as well for most clusters.
As mentioned in Sec. 4.1 we are generally unable to detect rota-
tion in P1 or P2 if the overall cluster is already rotating slowly
with (v=)HL.0:05 or when the number of stars per population
is of the order of 200 stars or below. Especially the results for
NGC 6656 and NGC 3201 could be improved signiÔ¨Åcantly by in-
creasing the number of stars per population, since these clusters
are rotating fast enough to overcome that limitation. One way to
tackle this issue is to determine the population tags directly from
the spectra. An alternative would be to add additional photomet-ric data to be able to assign more stars to their respective popu-
lation. This would be especially useful outside the core of each
cluster, where radial velocity measurements of stars are avail-
able (e.g. Baumgardt & Hilker 2018), but these stars have not
been separated into populations yet. Leitinger et al. (in prepara-
tion) are currently working on using ground-based photometry to
split the populations and derive density proÔ¨Åles for each popula-
tion in globular clusters. When we include their additional popu-
lation tags for NGC 7078, we observed small changes in the dis-
tribution of (v=)HL, but nothing signiÔ¨Åcant since the number of
stars per population is already comparatively large for that clus-
ter. Nonetheless, it seems worthwhile to pursue that approach,
since it also increases the radial range of the population data. It
is possible that this could increase the accuracy of measurements
of the rotation in P1 and P2 substantially. Another possibility for
a future work would be to use density proÔ¨Åles per population
to derive the rotation strength. Using data from Leitinger et al.
(in preparation) we checked whether our results for NGC 7078
change if we use their density proÔ¨Åles for P1 and P2, but we still
Ô¨Ånd that P2 rotates faster than P1 with a di erence larger than
1. However, if the populations have the same rotation and dis-
persion curves, but di erent concentrations, then we would ex-
pect to Ô¨Ånd kinematic di erences between them. This is because
the observed kinematics at a given projected radius correspond
to a di erent intrinsic radius relative to the cluster center. Ulti-
mately, one needs more sophisticated models to understand all
the details.

Notes. The two measures of the rotation strength (v=)HLandR;HLare derived from the parameter distribution of the parametric model, as
described in Sec. 3.2. The median relaxation times Trhfor each cluster are from Harris (1996, 2010 edition).
