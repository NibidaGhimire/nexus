Abstract
Sunspot Cycle 25 over 3 years past the cycle minimum of December 2019. At this point,
curve-fitting becomes reliable and consistently indicates a maximum sunspot number of
135±10 - slightly larger than Cycle 24’s maximum of 116.4, but well below the Cycles
1-24 average of 179 (ranging from 81 for Cycle 6 to 285 for Cycle 19). A geomagnetic
precursor, the minimum in the aa-index, and the Sun’s magnetic precursors, the polar
field strength and axial dipole moment at the time of minimum, are often used to pre-
dict the amplitude of the cycle at (or before) the onset of the cycle. We examine Cycle
25 predictions produced by these precursors. The geomagnetic precursor indicated a Cy-
cle 25 slightly stronger than Cycle 24, with a maximum of 132 ±8. The Sun’s magnetic
precursors indicated that Cycle 25 would be similar to Cycle 24, with a maximum sunspot
number of 120 ±10 or 114 ±15. Combining the curve-fitting results with the precursor
predictions, we conclude that Cycle 25 will have a maximum smoothed sunspot num-
ber of 134 ±8 with maximum occurring late in the fall of 2024. Models for predicting
the Sun’s magnetic field ahead of minimum, were generally successful at predicting the
polar precursors years in advance. The fact that Sun’s magnetic precursors at cycle min-
imum were successfully predicted years before minimum and that the precursors are con-
sistent with the size of Cycle 25 suggests that we can now more reliably predict the so-
lar cycle.
Plain Language Summary
Now that over 3 years have passed since the start of Cycle 25, we can determine
the size of the cycle and look back at previous predictions. For the last eleven months
we have consistently found that Cycle 25 is following the behavior of a smaller than av-
erage sunspot cycle, just slightly larger than the last cycle. The strength of the Sun’s
magnetic field at the start of a sunspot cycle has become recognized as the best predic-
tor for the ultimate strength of that cycle. This follows from solar magnetic dynamo mod-
els in which the magnetic field at minimum gets stretched and strengthened to produce
the magnetic sunspots and explosive magnetic activity of cycle maximum. Three differ-
ent measurements of the strength of the Sun’s magnetic field in late 2019 and early 2020
(at the start of the current sunspot cycle) indicated that this cycle would be slightly stronger
than the previous cycle, but still weaker than average. Models can be used to estimate
two of these measurements well before cycle minimum, thus providing a reliable predic-
tion years before the start of a sunspot cycle.
1 Introduction
Activity on the Sun varies with a periodicity of about eleven years. This variabil-
ity is characterized by fluctuations in the appearance of sunspots but also includes the
evolution of coronal holes, changes in the solar wind speed, and changes in the frequency
of eruptive events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (Hathaway, 2015). To-
gether, these and other solar phenomena drive changes in the interplanetary environment,
i.e. space weather. As space weather events interact with the Earth, they cause geomag-
netic storms that impact the geospace environment in a variety of ways. Extreme ultra-
violet and x-ray emissions give rise to ionization in the ionosphere and heating and in-
creased density in the thermosphere. This increases the drag on satellites and debris in
low Earth orbits and increases the risk of satellites colliding with debris or even com-
pletely deorbiting - as occurred in early 2022 with the SpaceX Starlink satellites (Hapgood
et al., 2022). Increases in energetic charged particles can further disrupt, damage, or cause
failure of satellites or their electrical components. While satellites essential for commu-
nications and national defense are most at risk, geomagnetic storms are not a threat to
just them. Radiation from these storms also pose a threat to astronauts in space and
crew on airline flights over the poles. Closer to home, ground-induced currents produced

by geomagnetic storms can overwhelm power grids, resulting in power outages. Predict-
ing the size of a solar cycle is an important step in improving our ability to prepare for
space weather years in advance.
Two (related) physics based precursors for predicting the amplitude of a solar cy-
cle have risen to the top as being the most reliable: geomagnetic activity levels and the
Sun’s magnetic configuration (polar fields and axial dipole moment) near the time of sunspot
cycle minimum. Cycle predictions can be made well before cycle minimum by using mod-
els to simulate the evolution of the Sun’s surface magnetic field. Once the cycle is well
under way, curve fitting can be used to determine the amplitude of the cycle. In this pa-
per, we present a comprehensive picture of the outlook for Solar Cycle 25 based on each
of these methods, individually and as a combined prediction.
2 Curve Fitting and the Amplitude (Maximum) of Cycle 25
Cycle 24/25 minimum occurred in December of 2019 and we are now over three
years into Cycle 25. At this stage of the solar cycle, curve fitting becomes quite reliable.
Hathaway et al. (1994) proposed a parametric curve for fitting to the monthly sunspot
numbers, R, in each cycle with:
R(t) =A(t−t0)3[exp[( t−t0)2/B2]−C]−1(1)
where Ris the relative sunspot cycle number and t−t0is the time in months since the
effective start of the cycle. Starting with four-parameters (amplitude A, rise time B, asym-
metry C, and starting time t0), they showed that the asymmetry parameter Ccould be
fixed as 0.71 for all cycles and the rise time parameter Bcould be expressed in terms
of amplitude with:
B= 27.12 + 25 .15.72/(A×103)1/4(2)
(This is the Waldmeier effect – big cycles rise more rapidly to maximum. By directly us-
ing the rise rate, Kumar et al. (2022) predicted a Rmax(25) = 138 ±26.) These refine-
ments to the fitting function allow the cycle to be fit with just two parameters - the start-
ing time for the cycle, t0, and the amplitude, A.
In 2015, the sunspot number was revised to version 2.0 (Clette et al., 2016; Smoothed
Sunspot Number , 2022, hereafter, V2.0), which increases the sunspot numbers by chang-
ing the multiplicative factor from 0.6 to 1.0 and by using the average of multiple observers.
We find that the values for BandChave changed for V2.0, with the best fit for B and
C now given by:
B= 36 .3 + 0.72/√
Amonths (3)
C= 0 .70 (4)
We apply a Levenberg-Marquart method (Press et al., 1992) to fit this nonlinear func-
tion of two parameters to the monthly sunspot numbers. Using the uncertainties in the
monthly sunspot numbers, we generate 100 Monte Carlo realizations of the monthly sunspot
number record, which are then fit to determine the uncertainties in the fit parameters.
The goodness of the fit between this two parameter function and the smoothed sunspot
number for previous cycles is shown in the top panel of Figure 1.
We investigate the accuracy of the fitting as the cycles progress by performing the
curve fitting at six month intervals from each cycle’s minimum. We then compare the
amplitude of the fit at each interval to the observed final amplitude fit. We find that us-
ing the the two parameters, the interval fit typically converges to within 10% of the fi-
nal fit values after about 3 years into each cycle (near the inflection point on the rising

cycles (bottom).
curve), as illustrated in the bottom panel of Figure 1. Note that there is a tendency to
overestimate the amplitude early in each cycle.
The curve fitting results for Cycle 25 were variable and quite uncertain until a year
ago (May 2022 – 30 months after minimum). Since then the results have been virtually
unchanged - the curve fitting has given Rmax(25) = 135 ±10 with t0= 2019 .8±0.3.
This determination of the amplitude of Cycle 25 is unlikely to change by more than 10%
as the cycle continues to develop.
3 Magnetic Precursors for Predicting Cycle Amplitudes
Geomagnetic precursors to the solar cycle were first suggested by the Russian re-
searcher Ohl in 1966 (Ohl & Ohl, 1979). He found that the minimum in geomagnetic ac-
tivity, as indicated by the aaindex ( Geomagnetic aa Index , 2022, plotted in the top panel
of Figure 2), is strongly correlated with the amplitude of the oncoming cycle . This can
be seen by comparing the heights of the minima, shown in blue, to the following peaks
in sunspot number, shown in red. (Note that we include a correctional offset of +3 nT
prior to 1957, when the English observing station was moved from Abinger to Hartland
(Svalgaard & Cliver, 2005).) A slight drawback to this method comes from the fact that
these geomagnetic minima usually occur just after the sunspot cycle minimum. Other
geomagnetic precursor methods have been devised to provide earlier predictions but are
either based on data that don’t cover as many sunspot cycles or require data process-
ing with free parameters (Feynman, 1982; Thompson, 1993).

The Sun’s polar magnetic field configuration near the time of cycle minimum is gain-
ing popularity as a precursor for the amplitude of the following cycle. At minimum, the
Sun’s magnetic field is well characterized by a simple axial dipole. This simple config-
uration is often the starting point for models of the Sun’s magnetic dynamo (Babcock,
1961). The geomagnetic precursors near minimum are thought to perform well because
they are driven by high-speed solar wind streams and are thus reflections of the strength
of the Sun’s polar magnetic fields (Schatten & Sofia, 1987; Wang & Sheeley, 2009). Mea-
surements of the Sun’s polar fields over the last four solar cycles have proven to be suc-
cessful predictors of the following cycle amplitude (Schatten et al., 1978; Svalgaard et
al., 2005; Petrovay, 2010; Mu˜ noz-Jaramillo et al., 2013).
Direct, systematic (daily) measurements of the Sun’s polar fields have been made
at the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) since 1976 ( Solar Polar Field Strength , 2022;
Hoeksema, 1995; Svalgaard et al., 1978). The polar magnetic field configuration can be
characterized in two different ways: by calculating the axial dipole component of the Sun’s
magnetic field (Figure 2, middle panel) or by averaging the flux density over each po-
lar region (i.e., the polar field strength, shown in Figure 2, bottom panel). The latitudes
and field component (e.g., radial or line-of-sight) used to calculate the flux density at each
pole are somewhat arbitrary. For WSO, the polar field measurement was set by the spa-
tial resolution of the instrument and defined using the highest latitude pixel, which mea-
sures the line-of-sight fields nominally between 55◦and the poles. Magnetic data from
other instruments have often employed the radial component and used different latitude
ranges. While the flux density over each polar region offers insight into hemispheric asym-
metries, the innate ambiguity associated with this measurement may make the axial com-
ponent of the Sun’s magnetic dipole a better metric for solar cycle prediction (Upton &
Hathaway, 2014).
4 Magnetic Precursor Measurements at Cycle 24/25 Minimum
We now have observations of the Sun’s polar fields as well as measurements of ge-
omagnetic activity during (and for three years after) the Cycle 24/25 minimum. For the
geomagnetic precursor, we focus on the minimum in geomagnetic activity as measured
by the aaindex (Ohl’s method) because it does not require any decomposition and the
measurements date back to 1868, allowing the relationship to be determined for 13 cy-
cles. For the polar field precursor, we look at both the polar field strength and the ax-
ial dipole strength during solar cycle minimum, as measured by WSO. These measure-
ments are all shown in Figure 2, along with the smoothed sunspot number V2.0. While
the polar field measurements do indeed appear to be indicative of the strength of the next
cycle, they only provide three solar cycles (Cycles 22-24) for determining the relation-
ship between the polar fields at minimum and the amplitude of the next cycle.
We begin by relating each precursor measurement to the strength of following cy-
cle as indicated by Rmax, i.e., the maximum smoothed sunspot number V2.0 for that
cycle. This is shown in Figure 3. We calculate the ratio of Rmaxto the minimum of the
geomagnetic aaindex for each cycle and find:
Rmax= (12 .3±0.8)aamin (5)
where, aaminis the minimum in the aaindex near the time of solar minimum. Likewise,
We calculate the ratio of Rmaxto the polar fields and axial dipole moment and find:
Rmax = (95 .6±8.3)Bpolar (6)
Rmax = (59 .5±8.2)Bl=1 (7)

where, Bpolar is the absolute value of the difference between the north and south polar
field strengths and Bl=1is the axial dipole field strength. While all three methods do
suggest a weak cycle, they don’t completely agree. The minimum in aa-Index of 10.76
gives Rmax(25) = 132 ±8, the WSO polar fields of 1.26 give Rmax(25) = 120 ±10,
and the WSO axial dipole of 1.91 gives Rmax(25) = 114 ±15. The variance weighted
mean of these precursors gives Rmax(25) = 125 ±6 where reported errors are 1 σer-
rors, which is slightly lower that, but within the range given by the current curve fitting
values.
5 Combined Prediction
Both the magnetic precursors and the curve fitting indicate that Cycle 25 sunspot
number maximum will be slightly bigger than the 116 of Cycle 24 but significantly smaller
than the average of 179 for all 24 previous cycles, which ranged from 81 for Cycle 6 to
285 for Cycle 19.
(Hathaway et al., 1999) proposed a combined prediction based on a weighted mean
of the precursor predictions and the curve fitting prediction with more weight given to
the curve fitting as the cycle progresses (50/50 at 36 months past minimum). This com-
bined prediction gives a maximum smoothed sunspot number of Rmax(25) = 134 ±8
with maximum occurring late in the fall of 2024. Figure 4 shows a plot of the predicted
curve, along with the observed monthly sunspot numbers V2.0.
6 Magnetic Precursor Estimates before Minimum
Modelers have sought to extend the predictive range of the polar field precursors
by using physics based dynamo models (Charbonneau, 2020; Nandy, 2021) or Surface
Flux Transport (SFT) models (Sheeley, 2005; Jiang et al., 2014) to obtain the polar fields
–8–manuscript submitted to JGR: Space Physics
years ahead of minimum. Kumar et al. (2022) showed that the rise rate of the polar fields
during the first three years after the reversal gave similar results as the rise rate of the
cycle, potentially providing an avenue for modelers to further extend their predictive range.
Before cycle minimum in 2019, the Solar Cycle Prediction Panel, which represents NOAA,
NASA and the International Space Environmental Services (ISES), released its official
sunspot number forecast ( Solar Cycle 25 Forecast Update , 2019), predicting a sunspot
number maximum of 115 ±10. Their consensus forecast was based largely on the model
projections for the polar fields at minimum.
In 2016 and 2018, we used our Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model to create
forecasts of the Sun’s polar fields in order to predict the strength of Solar Cycle 25 (Hathaway
& Upton, 2016; Upton & Hathaway, 2018). Our results indicated that the polar fields
at Cycle 24/25 minimum would be similar to those at the previous minimum, suggest-
ing Solar Cycle 25 would be a weak cycle, very similar in amplitude to Solar Cycle 24.
Another SFT model (Cameron et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2018) reported similar results,
predicting that Solar Cycle 25 would be slightly larger than Cycle 24 (with a maximum
of 116.4), but less than the more average sized Cycle 23 (with a maximum of 180.3, very
close to the Cycle 1-24 average of 179).
The AFT model assimilates the observed magnetic field from the SOHO/MDI (Scherrer
et al., 1995) and SDO/HMI (Scherrer et al., 2012) magnetograms in order to provide the
closest contact with the observations. This mode, known as the AFT Baseline, provides
the most accurate representation of the magnetic field over the entire surface of the Sun
based solely on near-side observation. In it’s predictive mode, AFT starts with a map
from the AFT Baseline and advances it forward to make predictions about how the Sun’s
magnetic field will evolve. In 2016 and 2018, we used AFT to create predictions of the
Sun’s polar field evolution in order to predict the strength of Solar Cycle 25. Now that
we are well past minimum, and Cycle 25 is well under way, we revisit those predictions
to assess their performance.
In (Hathaway & Upton, 2016), we predicted an axial dipole for the solar minimum
of 1.36±0.20 G and in (Upton & Hathaway, 2018) we predicted an axial dipole of 1 .56±
0.05 G. (A comparison of those results and detailed discussion can be found in (Upton
& Hathaway, 2018).) We show our 2018 polar field predictions in Figure 5 (blue lines),
along with the corresponding measurements from WSO (in black), and the AFT Base-
line constructed with the MDI, and HMI observations (in red). AFT was able to suc-
cessfully predict the evolution of the AFT/HMI axial dipole. However, the axial dipole
in the WSO observations was about 20% higher than HMI and AFT at the time of cy-
cle minimum.
The AFT polar field strengths (bottom panel of Figure 5) are calculated from the
radial magnetic field above 55◦(red line) and 60◦(pink line). The LOS WSO measure-
ments (nominally 55◦and above) are shown in black and the HMI derived Mean Radial
Fields 60◦(HMI Polar Field , 2022; Sun et al., 2015) are shown in light gray (smoothed
values in dark gray). AFT was able to successfully predict the evolution of the AFT/HMI
polar fields in the North, but that the polar fields in the South did diverge somewhat
starting in late 2019. The difference between the north and south polar field strengths
in the 2018 predictions ranged from 5.49 to 5.92, with an average of 5.68. The observed
difference was 5.25, or about 10% smaller than the AFT 2018 ensemble of predictions.
Note that the radial AFT/HMI polar fields above 55◦are smaller than the WSO single
pixel LOS polar fields corresponding to the same latitude range. The AFT Baseline po-
lar fields above 60◦at the start of 2020 agree with the WSO fields above 55◦and with
the HMI derived fields above 60◦.

7 Discussion
Geomagnetic and solar magnetic precursors have been shown to be most reliable
predictors of an impending solar cycle. However, there are still some uncertainties as-
sociated with these predictors. Currently, the geomagnetic precursors are more robust
due to the length of the dataset, but the physical mechanism behind their success is less
direct. The polar precursors have a stronger foundation in physics, but with a much shorter
time line the functional relationship is poorly defined. This is confounded by the fact
that the polar measurements, in and of themselves, are not well constrained. This is pri-
marily due to innate observational limitations. This is highlighted in Figure 5 by a) the
mismatch between the WSO and the MDI/HMI/AFT axial dipole measurements (top
panel), b) the annual oscillation in the WSO LOS polar field measurements (bottom panel),
and c) the spread in the HMI radial polar field measurements (bottom panel).
The WSO axial dipole and the MDI/HMI/AFT axial dipole appear to be offset in
both time and amplitude. The offset in time is most apparent during the dipole rever-
sals, as the WSO reversals precede the MDI/HMI/AFT reversal by about a year or two.
The offset in amplitude is most apparent during last solar minimum, when the axial dipole
is relatively flat. These offsets are a consequence of the limited resolution of the WSO
observations convolved with the changing latitude range of the WSO pixel (due to an
orbit around the inclined Sun). As previously mentioned, the highest latitude WSO pixel
measures the line-of-sight fields nominally between 55◦and the poles. However, the Sun’s
rotation axis is inclined ∼7.15◦with respect to the ecliptic plane. So, while on aver-
age the highest latitude pixel measures from 55◦and above, the latitudes actually be-
ing measured actually vary between 48◦and above to 62◦and above. This produces a
seasonal oscillation in the measurements of the Sun’s polar fields, which is clearly vis-
ible as an annual signal in the plot of the hemispheric polar field strengths (bottom panel
of Figure 5). Furthermore, the northern/southern (solid/dashed) hemisphere measure-
ments are 6-months out of phase with one another, such that the northern/southern WSO
measurements come into better agreement with the MDI/HMI/AFT measurements in
the Spring/Fall, when the the Southern/Northern pole is inclined toward the Earth. It
should be noted that these annual signals are present in the MDI and HMI data as well,
though to a lesser extent. This is because the higher resolution of MDI and and HMI
provide more detailed latitudinal coverage, but the inclined orbit causes the line-of-sight
angle of the magnetic field (with respect to the radial component) to also change by ±7◦
over the course of the yearly orbit.
The deviations in the polar field measurements are most notable when the polar
fields are rapidly evolving, during the polar field reversals. At this time, new polarity
flux is being transported to the poles to cancel with the old polarity polar flux, causing
a large latitudinal gradient in the high latitude flux. As the Earth orbits the Sun and
the latitudes measured by the most poleward WSO pixel change, the pixel samples lower/higher
latitudes and more of the new/old polarity flux is present in that pixel. Consequently,
the average polar field strength measured by that pixel changes substantially over the
course of the orbit resulting in the observed annual oscillation.
These deviations in the hemispheric polar field strengths feed into the measurements
of the axial dipole moment (top panel of Figure 5). However, rather than appearing as
an annual oscillation, they instead present as the offsets in amplitude and time noted
above. One might expect that the deviations would cancel out, since the northern and
southern hemispheres are out of phase with one another and one of the poles is always
favorable. However, the unfavorable pole always appears “ahead” in the polar reversal
process (because the lower latitudes that are being include have more new polarity flux).
This means that at nearly all times, one of the two poles will seem to be “ahead” and
thus the evolution of the axial dipole as measured by WSO will precede the true polar
reversal in time, producing the apparent temporal offset seen in the top panel of Figure 5.
–11–manuscript submitted to JGR: Space Physics
This is evidenced by the fact that the WSO polar field measurements preferentially pre-
cede the MDI/HMI polar field measurements.
If not properly accounted for, the temporal deviations can also produce an offset
in amplitude. The WSO axial dipole moment during minima is the “yardstick” used to
determine the strength of the next cycle for prediction purposes. Since, the axial dipole
moment is most crucial during solar minima, one might naturally scale the the WSO and
MDI/HMI measurements such that they are in agreement during the Solar Cycle 22/23
and Solar Cycle 23/24 minima (1999 and 2009), as done in Figure 5. However, doing so
results in the WSO dipole being about 20 percent higher than the HMI dipole for the
Solar Cycle 24/25 minimum in December 2019. This faulty scaling resulted in the AFT
solar cycle prediction underestimating the strength of Solar Cycle 25, not because the
flux transport did not accurately predict the evolution of polar fields, but rather because
the “yardstick” used to make the prediction was not calibrated properly.
While outside the scope of this paper, a detailed accounting of these deviations and
a proper calibration of the WSO observations with respect to the modern space obser-
vations is needed in order to reduce the uncertainty in the polar field-SSN relationship.
Uncertainty in the polar measurements and the polar field-SSN relationship would also
greatly benefit from polar mission to measure the magnetic fields from directly overheard
thus removing uncertainty associated with LOS observations of the magnetic field.
Uncertainty in the polar measurements not withstanding, the predictions presented
in this paper firmly point to Solar Cycle 25 being slight larger than Solar Cycle 24, but
no where close to the amplitude of Solar Cycle 23 or the average solar cycle strength ( ∼
180). This will be the first increase to the cycle amplitude that we’ve seen since solar
Cycle 21 (e.g., about 50 years). This may mean that we have reached the inflection point
in the current Gleissberg cycle and might start to see bigger cycles again.
