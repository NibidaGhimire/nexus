Abstract
We lay down a general scheme to quantify the amount of genuine tripartite entanglement present in the spatial and energy-
time degrees of freedom of entangled photon triplets using a resource-based measure known as the tripartite entanglement of
formation. Quantifying genuine tripartite entanglement relative to a number of maximally entangled three-qubit Greenberger-
Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states called gebits, the tripartite entanglement of formation serves as a basis of comparison between
dierent tripartite entangled states of diering dimension. Demonstrating genuine tripartite entanglement is doubly challenging
because it is not enough to show that each party is inseparable from the other two (which is sucient only for pure states).
Instead, one must rule out all mixtures of all combinations of biseparable states from describing the tripartite state. To meet
this challenge, we use entropic measures of the statistics of tripartite systems to simultaneously bound the correlations each
party has with the other two, and in so doing place a lower limit to the tripartite entanglement of formation. Even though
our measure never over-estimates the entanglement present, we estimate the eectiveness of our technique by determining
the exact tripartite entanglement of a triple-gaussian triphoton wavefunction with the same correlations as seen in photon
triplets generated in third-order spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Between these two eorts, we show that a
substantial amount of tripartite entanglement exists in both the spatial and energy-time degrees of freedom of these systems,
and propose an experiment that can measure them.

I. INTRODUCTION
Quantum entanglement is often cited as thesignature aspect of quantum physics that marks its departure from the
classical regime, and with good reason. The exponentially large state space coming from entangled superpositions
of multiple qubits is the basis for the advantages seen in quantum computing. The manifestly secure correlations
from entanglement forms the bedrock of quantum networking. In addition, the enhanced sensitivity using entangled
states of light allows researchers to probe beyond the standard quantum limit of shot noise. It is because of these
applications that characterizing the amount of entanglement present in a system as eciently as possible is of critical
importance toward benchmarking the utility and performance of new sources as they are being developed.
Historically, entanglement was originally considered a yes-or-no question. Over the last few decades [1{6], many
researchers have developed entanglement monotones and entanglement measures to compare dierent entangled states
with one another, either by how far away they are from the set of separable (unentangled) states, or by its utility
as a resource in entanglement-consuming tasks. While two-party entanglement has been well studied, and there
are increasingly ecient ways of quantifying it, entanglement shared between three or more parties has comparably
little research. In this work, we describe our strategy [7] to quantify genuine tripartite entanglement in the high-
dimensional degrees of freedom shared by entangled photon triplets. We describe the nonlinear-optical processes
used to generate these triplets, and the properties of the triple-gaussian wavefunction describing their spatial and
energy-time correlations.
II. QUANTIFYING TRIPARTITE ENTANGLEMENT
Entanglement is dened as a departure from separability. Given three parties A;B; andC, and a joint quantum state
^ABC shared by them, that state is considered separable either if the state factors out completely into ^ A
^B
^C,
or if it can be expressed as a classical mixture of these separated states:
^(sep)
ABC =X
ipi
^Ai
^Bi
^Ci
: (1)
The correlations present in a separable state are exclusively classical, given the preparation probability distribution
fpig. Any state that does not have this form is somehow entangled.
With only two parties, there is only one way a joint state can factor out as a product of individual states. With
three parties, there are multiple forms of separability, which dene multiple forms of entanglement. For example,
states of the form AB
C:
^AB
C=X
ipi
^ABi
^Ci
; (2)
are known as biseparable because they are expressible as mixtures of products of two states. For three parties, to be
triseparable is to be fully separable.
Because there are multiple ways for a tripartite state to be in some way separable, demonstrating genuine tripartite
entanglement is especially challenging. It is not enough to show that the state ^ ABC is not within any class of
biseparable or fully separable states. Instead, one must show that the state cannot be made using any ensemble of
states coming from any of these classes of states.
To quantify genuine tripartite entanglement, we use a measure [8] called the tripartite entanglement of formation
E3F(ABC ):
E3F(ABC ) = min
j iiX
ipiminfSi(A);Si(B);Si(C)g: (3)
For each pure-state decomposition of ^ ABC, we nd the minimum entanglement across all bipartitions (which would be
zero for a biseparable state). Then, we nd the minimum for this number across all possible pure-state decompositions
of ^ABC, which gives us the tripartite entanglement of formation E3F. IfE3F>0, then there must be some
genuinely tripartite-entangled state in every possible pure-state decomposition, proving the state is genuinely tripartite
entangled.
The tripartite entanglement of formation E3Fis a generalization of the ordinary entanglement of formation dened
between two parties [1]:
EF(AB) = min
j iiX
ipiminfSi(A);Si(B)g: (4)
Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: PA#: AFRL-2023-23193
For the ordinary entanglement of formation EF, there is a standard unit of entanglement known as the ebit, which is
a two-qubit maximally entangled Bell state:
j i(ebit)=1p
2
j0;0i+j1;1i
: (5)
Using the entanglement of formation EF, dierent two-party states can be compared relative to the number of ebits
of equal value.
For the tripartite entanglement of formation E3F, we dene a unit of three-party entanglement known as the gebit,
which is the three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state:
j i(gebit )=1p
2
j0;0;0i+j1;1;1i
: (6)
Similar to the ordinary entanglement of formation, the tripartite entanglement of formation E3Fcan be used to
compare dierent three-party states relative to a corresponding number of gebits. We use this purely as a side-by side
comparison of dierent tripartite entangled states, as there are unresolved questions in interpreting this measure as a
resource measure similar to the ordinary entanglement of formation.
There are complexities that arise in considering the gebit as a unit of tripartite entanglement. In particular, the W
state
jWi=1p
3
j1;0;0i+j0;1;0i+j0;0;1i
; (7)
is genuinely tripartite entangled, but cannot be expressed in terms of gebits. When synthesizing copies of genuinely
multipartite entangled states using local operations and classical communication (LOCC), there is still no known set of
resource states that can be used to accomplish this [9]. Moreover, the distillable tripartite entanglement can actually
be greater than the tripartite entanglement of formation because it is possible in principle to distill genuine tripartite
entanglement from multiple copies of biseparable states as a resource [10, 11]. While there remain fundamental
questions to be answered on the nature of tripartite entanglement as a resource, we use the tripartite entanglement
of formation E3Fto compare the amount of entanglement in an unknown quantum state to a corresponding number
of gebits.
A. Quantifying entanglement with correlations
It is often said that entanglement is a kind of correlation. While correlations can exist without entanglement (i.e.,
classical correlations), entanglement cannot exist without correlations. Completely uncorrelated product states are
separable by construction. Moreover, if the classical mutual information is zero in every local measurement basis,
then the state is again completely uncorrelated [12]. Together, this implies that all entangled states must have some
kind of measurable correlation.
Consider the following entanglement-correlation relation:
H(QA:QB)EF(AB) + minfS(AB);S(A);S(B)g: (8)
See proof in Appendix A. Here, classical correlations are quantied by the Shannon mutual information H(QA:QB)
of the joint probability distribution for the measurement outcomes of observables ^QAand ^QB; the mixedness of the
state ^ABis quantied by the joint von Neumann entropy S(AB); and the mixedness of the subsystems AandB
are quantied by their respective von Neumann entropies. For pure states of AB, (S(AB) = 0), and all measurable
correlations are identied as entanglement. For separable states, the correlations are bounded by the mixedness of
the subsystems.
Because two-party entanglement is so closely identied with two-party correlations, we examined how this relation-
ship works for tripartite entanglement.
In [13], we showed how one could use the correlations present between three D-level quantum systems to begin to
quantify the tripartite entanglement present. In particular, we found the relation:
E3F(ABC ) S(AjBC) S(BjAC) S(CjAB) 2 log(Dmax); (9)
whereDmaxis the maximum dimension between systems A,B, andC; and where S(AjBC) (for example) is the
quantum conditional entropy equal to S(ABC ) S(BC). For discrete observables ( QA;QB;QC) and (RA;RB;RC),
one can use a version of the uncertainty principle in the presence of quantum memory [14] to show:
 S(AjBC)log(
) (H(QAjQB;QC) +H(RAjRB;RC)); (10)

where

is a value that equals zero if observables ^QAand ^RAcommute, and approaches the dimension of system A,DAas
^QAand ^RAapproach being maximally uncertain with respect to one another (i.e., where the inner product of all
eigenstatesjqiiof^QAandjrjiof^RAare equal to 1 =pDA). This relation (10), when substituted into our relation (9)
allows us to quantify genuine tripartite entanglement in D-level systems. Because this strategy explicitly includes the
dimensions of the systems, it could not be used to quantify entanglement in continuous-variable systems unless we
make the a-priori assumption that the tripartite state is pure, which is experimentally unrealistic.
To solve this challenge, we developed a continuous-variable version of the uncertainty relation with quantum memory
[15]:
 S(AjBC)log(2) h(xAjxB;xC) h(kAjkB;kC); (12)
whereh(x) is the continuous Shannon entropy [16] of probability density (x), to create a corresponding entanglement
bound for continuous variables [7] where:
E3F(ABC )log(2jjjj) h(AxA+BxB+CxC)
 h(AkA+BkB+CkC): (13)
Here,jjjj= minifjijjijg, and the coecients ( A;B;C) and (A;B;C) may be adjusted to best t the
correlations naturally present in the system.
III. ENTANGLED PHOTON TRIPLETS IN NONLINEAR OPTICS
Nonlinear optics has been the preferred source for entangled photon pairs for decades. In short, photons from a
pump laser pass through a transparent medium, and the atoms within that medium respond to the oscillating electric
eld. When this disturbance is small enough that the response of the medium is in proportion to the electric eld,
we are in the domain of linear optics. Nonlinear optics exists in the regime where the eld is strong enough that the
atoms respond anharmonically, but before the electrons are ripped o of the atoms altogether.
The response of the material in nonlinear optics is described as a power series of the induced polarization of light
~Pas a function of the electric eld ~E[17]:

: (14)
Here,(1)
ijgives the linear optical susceptibility, while (2)
ijkand(3)
ijk`give the second and third-order nonlinear optical
susceptibilities respectively.
Just as in acoustic vibrations, an applied electric eld of a single frequency can induce the generation of light at
harmonics of that electric eld. What determines how much of each harmonic gets generated is in the magnitude
of the nonlinear susceptibilities, and whether the dispersion in the material makes momentum conservation possible
(where the index of refraction aects the wavelength and therefore the momentum of photons).
Quantum mechanically, generating light at a frequency twice that of the original pump beam requires pairs of
pump photons to be consumed to generate each photon at the second harmonic. Since the fundamental conditions
that optimize second-harmonic generation are only concerned with total momentum conservation and the scale of the
susceptibility, they are also the conditions that optimize the reverse process where pairs of photons (here called the
signal and idler photons) are generated at frequencies adding up to the frequency of an annihilated pump photon.
This(2)process, known as Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), has been the most popular source
of entangled photon pairs in quantum information for decades. Where the emitted biphotons are regarded as being
nearly in a pure state, the strong position correlations that come from the pair having a common point of origin (the
birth zone [18]), and the strong momentum correlations coming from momentum conservation with the original pump
photon imply a large degree of spatial entanglement can be created [15]. Similarly, from a common time of generation,
and energy conservation, a large amount of energy-time entanglement can be generated between these photon pairs
as well.
To create entangled photon triplets in nonlinear optics, there are two major approaches. The rst is to use a (3)
process that is the third-order analogue of SPDC, and the reciprocal process to third-harmonic generation. In this
Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: PA#: AFRL-2023-23195
case, photon triplets are created in single quantum events from each annihilated pump photon. The second approach
is to use(2)-SPDC twice; rst to split the pump photon into signal and idler, and the second to split the signal
photon into two again to yield three photons in total. In both approaches, momentum conservation and common
places of origin give rise to correlations and entanglement. From this, the coecients ( A;B;C) = (1; 1=2; 1=2)
and (A;B;C) = (1;1;1) will allow our tripartite entanglement relation to take maximum advantage of these
correlations.
Since both approaches to generate entangled photon triplets cover the same kind of correlations, we consider the
example of third-order (3)-SPDC. The case of cascaded (2)-SPDC is covered in [7].
In(3)-SPDC, the triphoton wavefunction in one transverse dimension has the form:
 (k1;k2;k3)Np(k1+k2+k3) (15)
Sinc
jk2+k3j2+jk1+k3j2+jk1+k2j23Lz
4j~kpj
;
wherep(k1+k2+k3) is the transverse pump momentum amplitude, which with momentum conservation becomes a
function of k1+k2+k3. See Appendix B for details. Like in ordinary SPDC, the sinc function coming from integrating
the phase matching exponential ei~k~ rover the dimensions of the nonlinear medium, except here we have a dierent

Our expression for  (k1;k2;k3), while complicated, greatly simplies if we use the rotated coordinates:

Just as the biphoton wavefunction in ordinary SPDC for a gaussian pump beam can be approximated as a double-

In a similar fashion, one may derive a corresponding wavefunction for the energy/time correlations of the entangled
triphotons from its joint spectral amplitude. For a narrow bandwidth pump, the joint spectral amplitude has the
form:
 (!1;!2;!3) =N0s(p

jd2k=d!2j!10), and where for example !1=!1 !10is the detuning of !1form its central frequency, and
(!u;!v;!w) are rotated frequency coordinates from ( !1;!2;!3) similar to those just used in momentum.
Here,s(!p) is the pump spectral amplitude (relative to pump central frequency) where energy conservation allows
us to make the substitution !p=!1+!2+!3=p
3!u. See Appendix C for derivation and details. Since
these energy-time tripartite correlations are of the same quality as the spatial correlations, we focus on the spatial
correlations for the remainder of this work.
IV. THE TRIPLE-GAUSSIAN WAVEFUNCTION AND TRIPARTITE ENTANGLEMENT
To describe the tripartite entanglement available in entangled photon triplets, we will rst look at the triple-gaussian
wavefunction that ts these correlations, and observe its entanglement properties.

For two-party entanglement in continuous-variable wavefunctions, the double-Gaussian wavefunction is an approx-

large beam,  +, and there will be strong correlations and entanglement. In the limit that  approaches zero,
we approach a generalization of the Bell state to continuous variables known as the EPR wavefunction [19]. Because of
how position and momentum space are related by fourier transforms, we can transform the double-gaussian function
readily to momentum space by the substitution:
k+=1
2+:k =1
2 : (23)
From this, we can also see that the same regime that provides strong position correlations ( + ) will also provide
strong momentum anti-correlations ( k k+).
For three-party entanglement in continuous-variable wavefunctions, we have the triple-gaussian wavefunction, which
is an approximate generalization of the GHZ state:
 (x1;x2;x3) =e (x1+x2+x3)2

(2)3=2uvw; (24)
The triple-gaussian wavefunction (when v=w) describes the spatial correlations of entangled photon triplets
that are symmetric under permutation of parties. In general, the momentum bandwidth of the pump beam, plus
momentum conservation (or alternatively just the pump beam diameter) mostly determines u, while only phase
matching determines v(and therefore w).

Here we can appreciate that the triple-gaussian wavefunction of entangled photon triplets is a gaussian spheroid
that transforms from a pancake-shaped distribution in momentum space (momenta nearly constrained to the plane
k1+k2+k3const ) to a sausage-shaped distribution in position space (position of one determines the other two to
within a birth zone). As dened for biphotons [18], the triphoton birth zone  BZhere is twice the standard deviation
of the initial position of one of the down-converted photons x1conditioned on the nominal position of the annihilated
pump photon xp= (x1+x2+x3)=3. With this denition, we get:

where the approximation comes from the triple-gaussian case where the distribution factors into a product of distri-
butions for xu,xvandxw, respectively. In the case of entangled photon triplets generated in multiple-stage processes
(such as cascaded 2-SPDC), the triphoton birth zone is more a measure of photon position correlations rather than
the size of the region in which the triphoton was approximately generated.
Remarkably, the tripartite entanglement of formation can be calculated exactly for this triple gaussian wavefunction
as discussed in [7]:
E3F(ABC ) =h2(0)
0; (28)
whereh2(0) is the binary entropy function:

Here we see that whenever the triple-Gaussian state is not fully separable (i.e., u6=v), there is a nonzero amount of
tripartite entanglement. Moreover, this tripartite entanglement may be made arbitrarily large when either uv
orvu.
The GHZ state possesses no two-party entanglement. Although the triple Gaussian wavefunction is an approximate
generalization of the GHZ state to high dimension, one can show that unless fully separable, it always has some small
amount of two-party entanglement. To show this, we look at the correlation statistics of a two-party subsystem of
the tripartite triple-Gaussian state.
The marginal position probability distribution of the triple Gaussian wavefunction is a double-Gaussian:

The marginal momentum probability distribution of the triple Gaussian wavefunction is also a double-Gaussian.
Since the triple gaussian wavefunction factors when using separated coordinates, we know from the fourier transform
relations of a gaussian wavefunction that:
ku=1
2u:kv=1
2v: (33)
In short, we may take the momentum-space triple-gaussian probability density to be identical to the position-space
density, once these preceding substitutions are made.
In momentum space, we have the correlation statistics:
(kB+kC) =s
1
32u+1
62v:(kB kC) =1
vp
2: (34)
Here, we discover a tradeo in correlations. To obtain strong position correlations, one must have vu.
However, to obtain strong momentum correlations one must be in the opposite regime where vu. If there is any
two-party entanglement in these two subsystems, it has a strict upper limit. Using these statistics, we can examine
whether any entanglement can be witnessed using these correlations.
In 2002, Mancini et. al [20] developed a strong separability criterion that works for continuous Fourier-conjugate
variables (e.g., position/momentum). In particular, all separable states must obey the condition
0 log((xBxC)(kBkC)); (35)

Foru=vthe triple gaussian state is fully separable, and the right-hand side of this criterion is zero. For all
other cases, the right-hand side of this criterion exceeds zero, but has a small upper limit of about +0 :7925 bits
(unlike for tripartite entanglement, which has no upper limit). This can be understood through the entanglement
correlation relation (8). In the limit of large tripartite entanglement S(C) is large, but so is S(AB). This means that
the measured correlations between AandBmay be large without there needing to be large entanglement between A
andB. Still, this means that unlike a true GHZ state, the triple-Gaussian wavefunction is either fully separable, or
else possesses both two- and three-party entanglement.
V. EFFECTIVENESS OF TRIPARTITE CORRELATIONS AT QUANTIFYING TRIPARTITE ENTAN-
GLEMENT
With the basics of tripartite entanglement of the triple-gaussian wavefunction covered, we can compare how well
our entanglement quantication strategy works compared to the approximate tripartite entanglement present.
Given the triple gaussian wavefunction

To put this bound into practice, let us input reasonable experimental parameters. Examples of the the reverse
process (THG) are seen in [21, 22]. Consider a pump beam of wavelength of 516 :67nm incident on a (3)nonlinear
medium of length Lz= 3mm. Let us consider degenerate (3)-SPDC into photon triplets of wavelength 1550nm. For
some materials, this phase matching may be achieved by angle tuning the medium and using its birefringence similar
to how most (2)-SPDC is carried out in other bulk crystals. To expand the range of capability, it would be useful to
achieve quasi-phase matching by periodically varying (3)over the length of the medium. However, periodic poling
does not ip the sign of (3)as it does for (2). Instead other strategies must be carried out such as periodically doping
the medium, or in using the intensity-dependent refractive index along with an illumination that varies periodically
along the medium. To phase-match PPLN, we consider type-I third-order SPDC, where the photon triplet has a
polarization orthogonal to the pump (but equal to each other), and with a quasi-phase matching period of 17 :69m
using dispersion data from [23] .
With these experimental parameters p= 516:67nm andLz= 3mm, we have plotted in Fig. 1 the amount of
spatial entanglement that can be witnessed as a function of the pump beam radius p, as well as the approximate
total entanglement assuming a triple-Gaussian wavefunction. Here we see that there can be a substantial amount of
tripartite spatial entanglement within these systems (where for example 5 gebits together constitutes 15 qubits).
VI. DISCUSSION: PROPOSED EXPERIMENT AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
Assuming we have a suitable source of tripartite entanglement, we can utilize the same kind of experiment used
to measure two-party spatial entanglement in [24]. In short, one images the face of the nonlinear medium (or its

represents the exact tripartite entanglement in the system assuming the triphoton wavefunction is well-described as
a triple-gaussian wavefunction with the same correlations. In the limit of large p, the two curves approach a
constant oset of 1  2=ln(2) or about 1:8854 gebits.
Fourier transform onto three digital micromirror device (DMD) arrays whose pixels can be directed toward or away
from respective photon detectors (See Figure 2 for diagram). To accomplish this, the light is split rst with a variable
beamsplitter tuned to amplitudes (p
1=3;p
2=3), where the spatial mode associated to thep
1=3 amplitude is directed
toward the rst DMD. The light in the exiting spatial mode associated to thep
2=3 amplitude is split again, this
time with an ordinary 50 =50 beamsplitter, whose exiting modes are directed toward their respective DMD arrays.
Using this pair of beamplitters maximizes the amplitude for the photon triplets to be separated, assuming they are
indistinguishable in polarization/frequency. These detections will be correlated with photon correlators in order to
obtain a photon triplet coincidence count rate. By examining how the triplet photon coincidence count rate changes
as a function of the patterns we place on each DMD array, we may build up either the joint position probability
distribution or the joint momentum distribution for the photon triplets, which may be used to conservatively estimate
the spatial entanglement present.

FIG. 2: Basic experimental diagram on using DMD arrays in concert with imaging optics and a Photon correlator
(PC) to measure triplet coincidence counts from a nonlinear crystal (NLC) pumped by a laser, one can obtain the
joint position probability distribution of the generated photon triplets.
To obtain these photon triplet statistics there are both technical and fundamental challenges that need to be
addressed. The major technical challenge to this approach is in collection eciency. If we only collect those photon
Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: PA#: AFRL-2023-231910
triplets that reect o of one triplet of micromirrors at a time, and scan over all possible pixel triplets, this collection
will be completely impractical because of the large number of pixel triplets, and the small fraction of the total
illumination that would correspond to a particular triplet. In [24] , we solved this challenge for photon pair sources
by using a smart multi-resolution sampling scheme. Instead of scanning over individual pixel triplets, we would rst
measure the spatial correlations at the lowest possible resolution (where say half of each DMD would be all-on or
all-o). Then, were we detect signicant coincidence counts, we would subdivide those regions, and measure them at
twice the resolution. Those sub-regions with signicant correlations would be further subdivided and sampled until we
have obtained a coarse-grained approximation of the biphoton joint probability distribution that is sampled at high
resolution only where there is signicant probability, but without overlooking regions of low probability. Because our
tripartite entanglement quantier (13) is based on continuous entropy, and coarse-graining cannot decrease continuous
entropy, we can use these same methods to quantify the tripartite entanglement present in these systems without
over-estimating it.
The major fundamental challenges in quantifying high-dimensional tripartite entanglement are in eciency and
confounding secondary processes. While third-harmonic generation (THG) can be obtained with reasonably high
eciency at suciently high input powers, this works primarily because the eciency of THG actually increases with
increasing input power. The reverse process of (3)-SPDC is a process whose eciency is relatively constant with
pump power, and is low enough that demonstrations of photon triplet generation of more than ten triplets per minute
[25, 26] are highly signicant. Alternatively, one can consider a resonant system where the pump laser power may
build up to a large value in a micro-ring resonator made out of a (3)medium, but where the down-converted photon
triplets are readily extracted.
For an estimate of the number of generated photon triplets in a (3)medium, we assume a single-mode gaussian
pump beam of power Pand radiusp; a medium of length Lz, and wide enough in both directions to encompass that
beam, and photon triplets with equal focal parameter to the pump such that, say 1=pp
3. This could be used to
describe triplet generation in a single-mode waveguide. With these assumptions (as well as assuming perfect phase
matching), one can use similar methods to those employed in [27] to show:

where here, 0is the group-velocity dispersion (second derivative of k(!)) at the central frequency of the down-
converted photon triplets. See Appendix C for abbreviated derivation. If we use statistics of fused silica [28, 29],
estimated for third-order downconversion from 516 :67!1550nm (using Miller's Rule to interpolate between the
values of(3)
effin [29]), and assume a 10 m (1=e2) beam diameter for the down-converted spatial modes, we obtain
the simplied formula:
Rtriplets(11:6267)LzP (42)
for a 10cm-long waveguide, one would need a relatively large 143 mW of pump power to start generating in excess of
ten triplets per minute. This prediction does not take into account the task of ensuring phase matching, which with
this dispersion, would require modulating the eective value of (3)over the length of the medium with a modulation
period of 29 :69m. This modulations would also decrease the eciency in the same way that nth-order quasi phase
matching decreases the eciency by a factor of 4 =(2n2).
Where one cannot periodically pole the nonlinear medium to change the sign of (3)one must instead rely on
techniques to create a static modulation of intensity over the nonlinear medium or of modulating the refractive index
(which modulates (3)
efffrom Miller's rule). As an example, if we can modulate the refractive index by 0 :01, this will
produce approximately a 17% change in (3)
eff, but will yield a triplet generation rate smaller by a factor of 0 :003, or
about a 25dB reduction in the generation rate compared to perfect phase matching. However, alternative media with
tunable properties have been proposed (e.g., hybrid photonic crystal waveguides or periodically tapered bers)[26, 30]
that oer promising eciencies.
When a nonlinear medium is strongly driven by a pump laser at high frequency, other processes can occur to
generate light at the down-converted wavelength that are not due to (3)-SPDC. In particular, spontaneous (Stokes)
Raman scattering with optical phonons in the medium can in principle create light within the same band as the
down-converted light. This is not the only such confounding process that can occur (e.g., other forms of uorescence
independent of Raman scattering). As to whether these processes will be a detriment will depend on their brightness
relative to the triplet generation rate. These confounding sources of light are unlikely to generate \dark" triplet
coincidences at intensities measured with single-photon detectors, but they will put an eective cap in input power,
given the maximum detection rate for the photon detectors used.

VII. CONCLUSION
In this work:
•we discussed how to quantify genuine tripartite entanglement in spatial and energy-time degrees of freedom
using correlations naturally present in nonlinear optics without assuming a pure quantum state.
•we derived the triphoton state for third-order SPDC as a source of entangled photon triplets, nding both its
spatial wavefunction, and its joint spectral amplitude
•we analyzed the triphoton wavefunction, and showed that our method can quantify a substantial amount of
tripartite spatial entanglement for these states
•we derived the generation rate of photon triplets in third-order degenerate SPDC to explore how bright these
sources may be.
•we proposed an experiment to measure these spatial correlations in a maximally ecient way that cannot
overestimate the entanglement present.
By developing the methods to better characterize the genuine tripartite entanglement in these rapidly developing
sources, we intend to spur motivation toward new approaches to capitalize on high-dimensional genuine tripartite
entanglement as a resource in quantum information technology.

Appendix A: Proof of entanglement correlation relation
A reduced form of the entanglement correlation relation was proved in [31]:
H(QA:QB)EF(AB) +S(AB) (A1)
Here, we show how this relation is improved to the form:
H(QA:QB)EF(AB) + minfS(AB);S(A);S(B)g (A2)
which is tighter in the case of separable, and presumably nearly separable states.
The monotonicity of the relative entropy [32] allows us to assert that the classical correlations quantied by the
Shannon mutual information will always be less than or equal to the quantum mutual information.
H(QA:QB)I(A:B) (A3)
This is because the classical mutual information can be interpreted as a quantum mutual information after measure-
ments have been performed on the system.
The quantum mutual information itself can be expressed in terms of marginal and conditional entropies:
I(A:B) =S(A) S(AjB) =S(B) S(BjA) (A4)
Next, we have that both  S(AjB) and S(BjA) are lower bounds to the entanglement of formation EF(AB).
Together this gives us the two equations:
I(A:B)S(A) +EF(AB) (A5a)
I(A:B)S(B) +EF(AB) (A5b)
Combining these relations with equations (A3) and (A1) gives us the three relations:
H(QA:QB)EF(AB) +S(AB) (A6a)
H(QA:QB)EF(AB) +S(A) (A6b)
H(QA:QB)EF(AB) +S(B) (A6c)
which are readily consolidated into the entanglement-correlation relation used in this paper:
H(QA:QB)EF(AB) + minfS(AB);S(A);S(B)g (A7)
Appendix B: Derivation of triphoton wavefunction for third-order SPDC
In this Appendix, we show how to derive the triphoton spatial wavefunction in third-order (3)SPDC (abbreviated
in subscripts as 3SPDC). To start, we have the hamiltonian for the (3)SPDC process:
^H3SPDC =X
kp;k1;k2;k3Gkp;k1k2;k3^akp^ay
k1^ay
k2^ay
k3+H:c: (B1)
To obtain the state of the down-converted light, we use rst-order time-dependent perturbation theory:
j i3SPDCX
kp;k1;k2;k3Gkp;k1k2;k3^akp^ay
k1^ay
k2^ay
k3jvaci (B2)
where factors of iand~have been absorbed into G. Since we are only interested in the triphoton wavefunction and not
in the absolute probability of triphoton generation here, many factors will be absorbed into an overall normalization
constant.
The spatially varying components of Gkp;k1k2;k3are given by:

where ~k~k1+~k2+~k3 ~kp, and(3)
eff(~ r) is the spatially varying eective third order susceptibility, regarded as
constant within the nonlinear medium, and zero outside.
With these approximations, we can begin to express the triphoton state in terms of a triphoton wavefunction:
j i3SPDC/X
kp;k1;k2;k3	(~k1;~k2;~k3)^ay
k1^ay

2
(B4b)
wherekpis a coherent state pump amplitude substituting for ^ akpin the undepleted (classically bright) pump
approximation.
Next, we assume the pump is suciently narrowband in frequency that its longitudinal momentum takes on one
value in the sum over kp. In addition we take the small-angle/ paraxial approximation so that the pump amplitude
kpfactors out as a product of a longitudinal amplitude pzand a transverse amplitude qp. Together, this gives:
	(~k1;~k2;~k3) =NZ
dkpxdkpyqp(~ qp) (B5)
Y
i=x;y;zsinc(k1i+k2i+k3i kpi)Li
2
(B6)
Next, we assume the transverse dimensions Lx;Lyof the medium are large enough to completely envelop the
transverse prole of the pump and down-converted light, which in turn, is much larger than the pump wavelength.
Because (Lx;Ly)p, we may treat the transverse sinc functions as delta functions, when integrating over the
transverse pump momentum, which also enforces transverse momentum conservation.
	(~k1;~k2;~k3) =NZ

sinc(k1z+k2z+k3z kpz)Lz
2
Y
i=x;y(k1i+k2i+k3i kpi) (B8)
To isolate the transverse spatial component of the triphoton wavefunction, we express the longitudinal momen-
tum components in the sinc function in terms of the respective momentum magnitudes and the transverse spatial
components through the Pythagorean formula:
kz=q
j~kj2 j~ qj2j~kj j~ qj2
2j~kj(B9)
The approximation comes from the small-angle approximation in which the magnitude of the transverse projection ~ q
of the momentum ~kis much smaller than the total magnitude of ~k. Initially, this complicates the sinc function:
	(~k1;~k2;~k3) =NZ

Y
i=x;y(k1i+k2i+k3i kpi) (B11)
Following this, we assume the use of narrowband frequency lters to x the magnitudes of j~k1j,j~k3j, andj~k4j, where
j~kpjhas already been xed in the narrowband pump assumption made earlier. Through optimum phase matching, we
can achieve the condition:
j~k1j+j~k2j+j~k3j j~kpj0 (B12)
Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited: PA#: AFRL-2023-231915
greatly simplifying the triphoton wavefunction.
By assuming the pump beam is well-collimated, its transverse momentum amplitude (~ qp) centered at ~ qp= 0 will
be narrow enough that we can neglect the sinc function's dependence on ~ qp:
	(~k1;~k2;~k3) =NZ

At this point, we can perform the integration over transverse pump momenta to eliminate the delta functions:

To simplify this wavefunction further, we re-apply the assumption that the pump has suciently narrow transverse
momentum bandwidth that dependence on transverse pump momentum can be eliminated from the sinc function:
	(~k1;~k2;~k3)Nqp(~ q1+~ q2+~ q3) (B16)

For our triphoton spatial wavefunction, we assume j~k1j=j~k2j=j~k3j=j~kpj=3, which gives us the nal simplied form:
	(~k1;~k2;~k3)Nqp(~ q1+~ q2+~ q3) (B17)

Among other things, we see that the triphoton wavefunction for a gaussian pump beam is well-approximated by a

In this expression: 0is the permittivity of free space; n~kis the index of refraction for a photon of momentum ~ p=~~k,
where we use ~kto index momentum to eliminate extra factors of ~=h=2, the quantum of angular momentum. With
this, we point out that the angular frequency of the photon !kis also indexed by its momentum. In addition: ^ a~ ;kz;s
is the annihilation operator of a photon with transverse spatial mode function g~ (x;y) indexed by ~ , longitudinal
momentum indexed by kzand polarization indexed by s, and~ kz;sis a unit vector in the direction of that polarization.
The eld modes are initially dened with respect to a rectangular cavity with volume V=LxLyLz, but the transverse
cavity dimensions disappear upon converting to the basis of transverse gaussian modes. To distinguish the dimensions
of the quantization volume from the dimensions of the nonlinear medium, we let fLx;Ly;Lzgbe the dimensions of
the nonlinear medium.
In this nonlinear-optical Hamiltonian, we are isolating the process of third-order SPDC by considering only terms
where pump photons are annihilated and photon triplets are created (and vise versa). A fuller treatment including
all other interactions of the nonlinear medium with a bright undepleted pump will include the intensity-dependent re-
fractive index (i..e, self-phase modulation) which eects the phase-matching properties of third-order down-conversion
as well. However, we may regard this eect as accounted for in the refractive indices of the medium used to predict
the overall brightness of photon triplet generation. Knowing this, we proceed with the rest of the calculation.
Next, we assume we are using one polarization of the pump, signal, and idler elds, and carry out the summation

Approximating the Hamiltonian as a continuous integral over frequency instead of a discrete sum of momenta by

To nd the state of the down-converted triplet, we assume a pump pulse with an average Npphotons, so that
(!p) =s(!p)pNP(andjs(!p)j2integrates to unity), and use rst-order time-dependent perturbation theory:

Whereei!tis the only time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian, integrating over all time produces a Dirac Delta
function(!), ensuring energy conservation. If we trace over the pump eld, which is independent under our
assumptions, we obtain for the state of the down-converted triplet:

To simplify the calculation of hNtripletsi, we focus on the overlap integral ( kz). Assuming that we are using only

To obtain a rate of triplet generation Rtriplets , it is enough to substitute the average pump photon number Npwith

Note: Although we assumed a pump pulse for this derivation, a CW pump beam can be interpreted as a continuous
mixture of pump pulses. Because of this, the number of photon triplets generated is a corresponding continuous sum
of the triplets generated from individual pulses.
