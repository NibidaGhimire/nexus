Redistribution mechanism design aims to redistribute the revenue collected by a truthful auction back to its participants without
affecting the truthfulness. We study redistribution mechanisms for diffusion auctions, which is a new trend in mechanism design [ 19].
The key property of a diffusion auction is that the existing participants are incentivized to invite new participants to join the auctions.
Hence, when we design redistributions, we also need to maintain this incentive. Existing redistribution mechanisms in the traditional
setting are targeted at modifying the payment design of a truthful mechanism, such as the Vickrey auction. In this paper, we do not
focus on one specific mechanism. Instead, we propose a general framework to redistribute the revenue back for all truthful diffusion
auctions for selling a single item. The framework treats the original truthful diffusion auction as a black box, and it does not affect its
truthfulness. The framework can also distribute back almost all the revenue.
Additional Key Words and Phrases: Mechanism design; Redistribution framework; Social networks.
1 INTRODUCTION
We focus on a resource allocation problem that involves a group of self-interested agents competing for the resources.
One important goal of the allocation problem is to maximize social welfare, and a common method is to hold an
auction so that the agents with the highest valuations of the resources can be found. The Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
mechanism [ 2,5,17] is a well-known method under which the agents will truthfully report their valuations and the
resources will be allocated to the agents with the highest valuations. This will also lead to a high revenue for the seller.
However, in many situations, we do not seek for a profit. Hence, there is another body of studies on how to return the
revenue to the participants [1, 6–9, 15, 16], which is called redistribution mechanism design.
In recent years, researchers have started to design mechanisms on social networks [ 3,10], where the goal is to
incentivize agents to invite new agents via their social connections to join in [ 11,13,14,18,20,21]. By doing so, the
mechanism can further improve social welfare or revenue in, for example, auctions. Therefore, introducing social
network to redistribution problems is a good choice to break through the efficiency limitations of traditional settings.
There are many realistic scenarios of redistribution on social networks. For example, consider a non-profit organization
like a government who has some idle resources, such as properties confiscated from criminals. These resources are
normally destroyed and sold cheaply to a small group of people, as the organization does not want to gain much profit
from clearing the resources. By utilizing social networks, we could attract more buyers who are willing to pay more to
receive the idle resources, but the profit could still be redistributed back to participants.
Redistribution on networks is also more challenging than traditional settings because the action space of the partici-
pants is enlarged. Therefore, we are not able to directly apply the existing solutions such as Cavallo’s mechanism [ 1].
The intuition behind this failure is that agents will have no incentives to invite their competitors in an auction, or invite
others to share a limited redistribution. Another difficulty is that agents’ valuations not only determine the winner of
the auction, but also relate to how much revenue can be redistributed. Therefore, the redistribution problem is not
about a simple combination of a truthful auction mechanism and a truthful reward distribution mechanism, which may
not produce a truthful redistribution mechanism.
1arXiv:2303.03075v1  [cs.GT]  6 Mar 2023More importantly, there are a bunch of different diffusion mechanisms with different allocation and payment policies.
It is complex and tedious to design the redistribution mechanism for each diffusion auction separately. Hence, we
design the first general redistribution framework for all diffusion auctions. The framework can redistribute almost all
the revenue of any diffusion auction back to all agents without affecting the properties of incentive compatibility and
individual rationality. In fact, our framework can also be applied to all traditional auctions. In particular, when the input
mechanism is VCG, the mechanism generated by our framework is Cavallo’s mechanism. Therefore, our framework is
a general solution for redistribution mechanism design with or without networks.
2 PRELIMINARIES
We consider a setting where a sponsor 𝑠wants to allocate a single item on a social network. Apart from the sponsor,
the social network consists of 𝑛agents denoted by 𝑁={1,...,𝑛}. Each agent 𝑖∈𝑁∪{𝑠}has a private neighbour set
𝑟𝑖⊆𝑁∪{𝑠}\{𝑖}, which represents the agents with whom 𝑖can communicate directly. Furthermore, each agent 𝑖∈𝑁
has a private valuation for the item of 𝑣𝑖≥0. Initially, the sponsor can only invite her neighbours to participate in the
allocation. In order to attract more participants, the sponsor asks participants who have already joined the allocation
to further invite their neighbours to join. However, participants are competitors, so they would not invite each other
by default. Thus, we need to design mechanisms to incentivize them to invite each other, which are called diffusion
mechanisms.
Formally, the diffusion mechanism requires each agent to report not only her valuation but also her neighbour set
(which is equivalent to inviting her neighbours). Let 𝜃𝑖=(𝑣𝑖,𝑟𝑖)be the type of an agent 𝑖∈𝑁and𝜃′
𝑖=(𝑣′
𝑖,𝑟′
𝑖)be the
reported type of 𝑖, with𝑟′
𝑖⊆𝑟𝑖representing the actual neighbour set she has invited, which can only be a subset of her
true neighbour set 𝑟𝑖. Let𝜃′=(𝜃′
1,...,𝜃′𝑛)=(𝜃′
𝑖,𝜃′
−𝑖)be the overall report profile, and 𝜃′
−𝑖is the overall report profile
except for𝑖. LetΘ𝑖represent the type space of agent 𝑖andΘ=(Θ1,...,Θ𝑛)represent the type profile space of all agents.
Given any report profile 𝜃′, it induces a directed graph denoted by 𝐺(𝜃′)=(𝑉(𝜃′),𝐸(𝜃′)), where𝑉(𝜃′)=𝑁∪{𝑠}and
𝐸(𝜃′)={(𝑠,𝑗)|𝑗∈𝑟𝑠}∪{(𝑖,𝑗)|𝑖∈𝑁,𝑗∈𝑟′
𝑖}. Let𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′))denote the set of agents accessible from 𝑠in𝐺(𝜃′). Because
the others cannot receive the proper invitation started by the sponsor, only the agents in 𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′))can actually join
the allocation (in practice, this means that the others will not be informed about the allocation at all). An example of
the induced graph 𝐺(𝜃′)is shown in Figure 1.
The goal of the sponsor is to allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation, but she does not want to
gain any profit from the allocation. Hence, the sponsor need to redistribute the revenue from a given diffusion auction
mechanism.
Definition 2.1. A diffusion auction mechanism Mis defined by an allocation policy 𝜋={𝜋1,..,𝜋𝑛}and a payment
policy𝑥={𝑥1,...,𝑥𝑛}, where𝜋𝑖:Θ→{0,1}and𝑥𝑖:Θ→Rare the allocation and payment for 𝑖respectively.
Additionally, for all report profiles 𝜃′∈Θ,
•for any agent 𝑖∉𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′)),𝜋𝑖(𝜃′)=0and𝑥𝑖(𝜃′)=0;
•for any agent 𝑖∈𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′)),𝜋𝑖(𝜃′)and𝑥𝑖(𝜃′)are independent of the reports of agents who are not in 𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′));
•Í
𝑖∈𝑁𝜋𝑖(𝜃′)≤1.
Given the agents’ report profile 𝜃′,𝜋𝑖(𝜃′)=1means that the item is allocated to agent 𝑖, while𝜋𝑖(𝜃′)=0means
that𝑖does not get the item. In addition, 𝑥𝑖(𝜃′)≥0means that 𝑖pays𝑥𝑖(𝜃′)to the sponsor, and 𝑥𝑖(𝜃′)<0indicates
that𝑖receives|𝑥𝑖(𝜃′)|from the sponsor. Therefore, the surplus of the payment transfers in the mechanism (i.e., the

revenue) is defined by
𝑆(𝜃′)=∑︁
𝑖∈𝑁𝑥𝑖(𝜃′).
Then in our setting, given the type 𝜃𝑖=(𝑣𝑖,𝑟𝑖)of an agent𝑖and the report profile 𝜃′, the utility of agent 𝑖under the
diffusion auction mechanism M=(𝜋,𝑥)is
𝑢𝑖(𝜃𝑖,𝜃′)=𝜋𝑖(𝜃′)·𝑣𝑖−𝑥𝑖(𝜃′).
In the following, we will define several properties that are required for the diffusion auction mechanism. First, an
agent should not suffer a loss if she reports her true valuation on the item.
Definition 2.2. A diffusion auction mechanism M=(𝜋,𝑥)isindividually rational (IR) if for all 𝑖∈𝑁and all
𝜃′∈Θ, we have
𝑢𝑖(𝜃𝑖,((𝑣𝑖,𝑟′
𝑖),𝜃′
−𝑖))≥ 0.
Next, we want to incentivize all agents not only to report their true valuations but also to invite all their neighbours
to join the mechanism, i.e., reporting their true types is a dominant strategy.
Definition 2.3. A diffusion auction mechanism M=(𝜋,𝑥)isincentive compatible (IC) if for all 𝑖∈𝑁with𝜃𝑖∈Θ𝑖,
and all𝜃′
𝑖∈Θ𝑖,𝜃′
−𝑖∈Θ−𝑖, we have
𝑢𝑖(𝜃𝑖,(𝜃𝑖,𝜃′
−𝑖))≥𝑢𝑖(𝜃𝑖,(𝜃′
𝑖,𝜃′
−𝑖)).
The sum of the payment transfers should be non-negative for the sponsor 𝑠; otherwise, she will pay a deficit.
Definition 2.4. A diffusion auction mechanism M=(𝜋,𝑥)isnon-deficit (ND) if for all 𝑖∈𝑁and all𝜃′∈Θ, we
have
𝑆(𝜃′)=∑︁
𝑖∈𝑁𝑥𝑖(𝜃′)≥0.
Finally, recall that our sponsor does not want to gain any profit. Our goal is to establish a framework that can create
a diffusion redistribution mechanism from a given diffusion auction mechanism M𝑎=(𝜋𝑎,𝑥𝑎). Given the report
profile𝜃′∈Θ, denote the revenue achieved by M𝑎as𝑆𝑎(𝜃′)=Í
𝑖∈𝑁𝑥𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′). Then our framework is to decide the
amount𝑅𝑖that is returned to each agent 𝑖, i.e., to decide a redistribution mechanism M=(𝜋,𝑥)with𝜋𝑖(𝜃′)=𝜋𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)
and𝑥𝑖(𝜃′)=𝑥𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)−𝑅𝑖(𝜃′). A diffusion redistribution mechanism, speaking formally, is also a diffusion auction
mechanism, but we want it to redistribute the revenue back to agents as much as possible, i.e., the sum of the payment
transfers should be close to 0, which is define as follows.
3Definition 2.5. A diffusion redistribution mechanism M=(𝜋,𝑥)isasymptotically budget-balanced (ABB) if for
all𝜃′∈Θ,
lim𝑛→∞𝑆(𝜃′)=0.
It means that the remaining revenue that has not been redistributed is approaching zero if the number of agents in
the underlying network is large enough. We also consider an approximation to ABB when it is hard to achieve.
Definition 2.6. A diffusion redistribution mechanism M=(𝜋,𝑥)is𝜖-asymptotically budget-balanced (𝜖-ABB) if
for all𝜃′∈Θ,
lim𝑛→∞𝑆(𝜃′)≤𝜖
where𝜖>0is a constant.
Before we introduce our framework, we show that directly applying classic Cavallo’s mechanism fails to satisfy our
properties. We recall Cavallo’s mechanism as follows.
Cavallo’s Mechanism
(1) Given𝐺(𝜃′), the mechanism chooses the winner 𝑤∈arg max𝑖∈𝑁𝑣′
𝑖, and set𝜋𝑤(𝜃′)=1.
(2)For each agent 𝑖, her payment is 𝑥𝑖(𝜃′)=𝑥𝑉𝐶𝐺
𝑖(𝜃′)−𝑥𝑉𝐶𝐺
𝑤′(𝜃′
−𝑖)/𝑛, where𝑥𝑉𝐶𝐺
𝑖(𝜃′)is𝑖’s payment under
VCG and𝑤′is the winner when we run VCG without agent 𝑖.
Proposition 2.7. Cavallo’s mechanism is not an incentive compatible diffusion redistribution mechanism.
Proof. We prove this by giving an example in Figure 2. First for the situation without diffusion shown in Figure 2(1),
by Cavallo’s mechanism, agent 𝐶wins the item and 𝜋𝐶(𝜃′)·𝑣𝐶=4,𝑥𝑉𝐶𝐺
𝐶(𝜃′)=3. If agent𝐶is removed, 𝐵will win
the item, so 𝑥𝑉𝐶𝐺
𝑤′(𝜃′
−𝐶)=2. Similarly we can get 𝑥𝑉𝐶𝐺
𝑤′(𝜃′
−𝐴)=3and𝑥𝑉𝐶𝐺
𝑤′(𝜃′
−𝐵)=2. Therefore, agent 𝐴,𝐵and𝐶
will receive 1,2
3, and2
3as redistribution respectively. However, in Figure 2(2), when agent 𝐶invites agent 𝐷and we
still apply Cavallo’s mechanism, 𝐶is still the winner and all VCG payments will not change. Then, agent 𝐶can only get
2
4=1
2(since𝑛becomes to 4) as redistribution. The payments for getting the item are the same, but the revenue from
redistribution decreases after inviting 𝐷so agent𝐶has no motivation to invite 𝐷.
Hence, Cavallo’s mechanism is not IC with diffusion. □

43 REDISTRIBUTION FRAMEWORK FOR DIFFUSION AUCTIONS
In this section, we propose a network-based redistribution mechanism framework (NRMF) for all IC diffusion auction
mechanisms. We first consider a subproblem to redistribute a value to all agents without affect the IC property.
3.1 Proportional Reward Sharing in a Tree
We consider a problem that a sponsor 𝑠wants to share a reward of 𝐵≥0with a set of agents 𝑁connected as a tree
rooted by𝑠.
For a tree𝑇(𝑁∪{𝑠},𝐸)rooted by𝑠, we introduce the following two notations.
•Let𝑝𝑖∈𝑁∪{𝑠}be the parent agent of 𝑖∈𝑁in𝑇.
•Let𝐶𝑖be the set of all agents in the subtree rooted by 𝑖in𝑇(excluding𝑖).
We define the following distribution mechanism.
Proportional Reward Sharing in a Tree (PRST)
Input : a tree𝑇=(𝑁∪{𝑠},𝐸)and a rewardB.
(1) Set Ω𝑠=1.
(2) For each agent 𝑖∈𝑁, let
total=|𝐶𝑖|+1
|𝐶𝑝𝑖|,base=1
|𝐶𝑝𝑖|−|𝐶𝑖|
and then recursively define
 
𝜔𝑖=Ω𝑝𝑖·(base+(total−base)𝛼)
Ω𝑖=Ω𝑝𝑖·total−𝜔𝑖=Ω𝑝𝑖·(total−base)·(1−𝛼)
with predefined parameter 0<𝛼<1.
(3) Set𝑏𝑖=𝜔𝑖B.
Output : the share𝑏𝑖for all agents 𝑖∈𝑁.
In the PRST, 𝜔𝑖is the proportion of the reward allocated to agent 𝑖andΩ𝑖is the proportion of the reward that agent
𝑖gives to her descendants. The proportion 𝜔𝑖has two parts. The first part is the basic reward, which is determined by
the number of descendants of her siblings ( |𝐶𝑝𝑖|−|𝐶𝑖|inbase). The second part is the reward for her diffusion, which
increases proportionally to the number of her descendants ( |𝐶𝑖|). A running example of the PRST is given in Figure 3.
In Figure 3, considering agent 𝐴,|𝐶𝑝𝐴|means the number of agents in the whole tree excluding 𝑠, which is 18.|𝐶𝐴|
means the number of descendants of agent 𝐴, which is 5. According to the definition, Ω𝑝𝐴=Ω𝑠=1. Therefore,

Similarly, considering agent 𝐵,|𝐶𝑝𝐵|means the number of descendants of agent 𝐴, which is 5.|𝐶𝐵|means the number
of descendants of agent 𝐵, which is 2. Hence, we have Ω𝑝𝐵=Ω𝐴=|𝐶𝐴|+1

In the PRST, each agent can get a basic share when she joins the mechanism, and the base part only depends on the
number of agents in the subtrees leading by her siblings. Then she can get a bigger share if she invites her neighbours
to join in. The proportion of the share is determined by how many descendants she has compared to her siblings.
Intuitively, we introduce a propagation competition among siblings, and the one with a larger propagation will get a
larger share of the reward. We illustrate several useful properties of the procedure below.
Lemma 3.1. In the PRST, 𝑏𝑖≥0for all𝑖∈𝑁.

Lemma 3.2. In the PRST, agents have no incentives to block any of her children’s participation.
Proof. Since the rewardBis fixed, then we only need to consider the coefficients 𝜔𝑖. Suppose an agent 𝑖’s coefficient

𝑖|byΔ|𝐶𝑖|. Then for all agent 𝑖’s

Therefore, agent 𝑖will suffer a loss if the amount of her descendants decreases so she has no incentives to block any of

3.2 Network-based Redistribution Framework
Now we propose our redistribution framework for diffusion auctions. We first introduce a key concept called the
diffusion critical tree , which reveals who takes the most important role for each agent’s participation and simplifies the
graph structure.
Given a report profile 𝜃′, and the induced graph 𝐺(𝜃′), we can generate a diffusion critical tree 𝑇(𝜃′)from𝐺(𝜃′)as
the following.
•𝑇(𝜃′)is a rooted tree, where sponsor 𝑠is the root and there is an edge (𝑠,𝑖)for all𝑖∈𝑟𝑠.
•For all agents 𝑖,𝑗∈𝑁, there is an edge(𝑖,𝑗)if and only if (1) 𝑖is a cut-point to disconnect 𝑗from𝑠, (2) there
is no cut-point to disconnect 𝑗from𝑖. Intuitively, agent 𝑖is the closest agent to 𝑗whose leaving will block 𝑗’s
participation.
Figure 4 shows an example of the above process. In Figure 4(1), taking agent 𝐻as an example, we can see that the
closest agent whose leaving will block her participation is agent 𝐴. Hence, the parent of agent 𝐻in𝑇(𝜃′)is agent𝐴.
We call agent 𝐴as𝐻’scritical parent , and agent𝐻and𝐴are𝐽’scritical ancestors .
Then, we present our network-based redistribution mechanism framework with diffusion auction mechanism M𝑎as
the input.

Fig. 4. (1) is a network 𝐺(𝜃′). (2) is the corresponding diffusion critical tree 𝑇(𝜃′). The number in each node is the reported valuation
of the agent.
Network-based Redistribution Mechanism Framework (NRMF)
Input : a diffusion auction mechanism M𝑎and
a report profile 𝜃′.
(1)Run diffusion auction mechanism M𝑎on𝜃′and it outputs 𝜋𝑎(𝜃′),𝑥𝑎(𝜃′). The revenue gain by M𝑎is
𝑆𝑎(𝜃′).
(2) Let𝜋(𝜃′)=𝜋𝑎(𝜃′).
(3) Let𝑇(𝜃′)be the diffusion critical tree of 𝐺(𝜃′). Let𝑇𝑖be the subtree in 𝑇(𝜃′)rooted by𝑖∈𝑁.
(4) SetB=1and run the PRST on 𝑇(𝜃′), and get𝑏𝑖for each𝑖∈𝑁.
(5)Letˆ𝑟𝑠be the set of the neighbours of the sponsor 𝑠in𝑇(𝜃′). And agents in the set are labelled as (𝑚1,..,𝑚|ˆ𝑟𝑠|).
(6) For each subtree 𝑇𝑚𝑘,1≤𝑘≤|ˆ𝑟𝑠|, set𝜃′′as
𝜃′′
𝑖= 
𝜃′
𝑖if agent𝑖∉𝑇𝑚𝑘
(0,∅) if agent𝑖∈𝑇𝑚𝑘
and simulateM𝑎on𝜃′′. The revenue gained by M𝑎is𝑆𝑎(𝜃′′). Let𝐵𝑘=𝑆𝑎(𝜃′′).
(7) For each 𝑖∈𝑁, set share ˆ𝑏𝑖=𝑏𝑖·𝐵𝑘if𝑖∈𝑇𝑚𝑘(1≤𝑘≤|ˆ𝑟𝑠|).
(8) Let𝑅𝑖(𝜃′)=ˆ𝑏𝑖=𝜔𝑖𝐵𝑘(sinceB=1) and𝑥𝑖(𝜃′)=𝑥𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)−𝑅𝑖(𝜃′).
Output : the allocation 𝜋(𝜃′)and the payment 𝑥(𝜃′).
Intuitively, the diffusion critical tree 𝑇(𝜃′)is divided into|ˆ𝑟𝑠|subtrees. The 𝐵𝑘for a subtree 𝑇𝑚𝑘is the revenue
obtained by running M𝑎on𝜃′′where𝑇𝑚𝑘is blocked. The 𝐵𝑘is shared by all agents in 𝑇𝑚𝑘, and it is independent of
these agents’ report profiles. We will show that the procedure of the PRST will not affect the independence of 𝐵𝑘and
that the whole mechanism is incentive compatible. It should be noted that as 𝛼grows larger, it will redistribute more to
the inviters; otherwise, the invitees will receive more. We can flexibly change the value of 𝛼in the PRST according to
the practical requirements without affecting the properties. Note that when the input mechanism is simply running
9traditional mechanism (e.g., the VCG mechanism) in traditional settings (i.e., all agents are sponsor’s neighbours), NRMF
still works. Therefore, our framework is a general solution for redistribution problems with or without networks.
We now demonstrate that NRMF can satisfy the desirable properties of IR, IC, and non-deficit if the input diffusion
auctionM𝑎is IR, IC, non-deficit and revenue monotonic.
Theorem 3.4. The instance of diffusion redistribution mechanism given by NRMF is individually rational (IR) if the
input diffusion auction M𝑎is IR and non-deficit.
Proof. Consider agent 𝑖’s utility,𝑖∈𝑁.
𝑢𝑖(𝜃𝑖,𝜃′)=𝜋𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)𝑣𝑖−𝑥𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)+𝑅𝑖(𝜃′)
The part of 𝜋𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)𝑣𝑖−𝑥𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)is the utility of 𝑖in the diffusion auction mechanism M𝑎, which is non-negative if
agent𝑖reports her type truthfully since M𝑎is IR, i.e.,
𝜋𝑎
𝑖((𝜃𝑖,𝜃′
−𝑖))𝑣𝑖−𝑥𝑎
𝑖((𝜃𝑖,𝜃′
−𝑖))≥ 0 (3)
On the other hand, considering the part 𝑅𝑖(𝜃′)=𝜔𝑖𝐵𝑘, for𝑖∈𝑇𝑚𝑘,1≤𝑘≤|ˆ𝑟𝑠|, sinceM𝑎is non-deficit, then
𝐵𝑘≥0 (4)
Finally, according to Lemma 3.11, we have
𝜔𝑖≥0 (5)
Combining (3), (4), and (5), we get
𝑢𝑖(𝜃𝑖,(𝜃𝑖,𝜃′
−𝑖))≥ 0
Therefore, the mechanism is individually rational. □
Theorem 3.5. The instance of diffusion redistribution mechanism given by NRMF is incentive compatible (IC) if the
input diffusion auction M𝑎is IC.
Proof. Consider agent 𝑖’s utility when she truthfully reports her type 𝜃𝑖,𝑖∈𝑁.
𝑢𝑖(𝜃𝑖,𝜃′)=𝜋𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)𝑣𝑖−𝑥𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)+𝑅𝑖(𝜃′)
where𝜃′=(𝜃𝑖,𝜃′
−𝑖).
If agent𝑖misreports𝜃′
𝑖, then suppose ℓis the loss of 𝑖in diffusion auction mechanism M𝑎because of misreport.
SinceM𝑎is IC,ℓ≥0and we have:
𝑢𝑖(𝜃𝑖,𝜃′)−𝑢𝑖(𝜃𝑖,𝜃′′)=ℓ+𝑅𝑖(𝜃′)−𝑅𝑖(𝜃′′)
where𝜃′′=(𝜃′
𝑖,𝜃′
−𝑖), which means agent 𝑖reports profile 𝜃′
𝑖that may be different from the type 𝜃𝑖, and the report
profile of all agents except for 𝑖remains𝜃′
−𝑖.
Suppose𝑖∈𝑇𝑚𝑘in𝑇(𝜃′). Since𝑖cannot change her position in critical diffusion tree, which only depends on agents
who invite her, then 𝑖∈𝑇𝑚𝑘in𝑇(𝜃′′), too. Let𝑅𝑖(𝜃′)=𝜔𝑖𝐵𝑘and𝑅𝑖(𝜃′′)=𝜔′
𝑖𝐵′
𝑘. Since𝐵𝑘and𝐵′
𝑘is the revenueM𝑎
can achieve without the participation of agents in 𝑇𝑚𝑘, we have𝐵𝑘=𝐵′
𝑘. Finally, with misreporting, 𝑖can only decrease
10the number of her descendants in 𝑇𝑚𝑘. According to Lemma 3.2, we have 𝜔𝑖≥𝜔′
𝑖. Therefore,
𝑢𝑖(𝜃𝑖,𝜃′)−𝑢𝑖(𝜃𝑖,𝜃′′)=ℓ+𝑅𝑖(𝜃′)−𝑅𝑖(𝜃′′)
=ℓ+(𝜔𝑖−𝜔′

from which we can conclude that the mechanism is IC. □
A diffusion auction is revenue monotonic if the revenue of the auction monotonically increases as the number of
participants increases.
Definition 3.6. A diffusion auction is revenue monotonic if for all𝜃′,𝜃′′∈Θwith𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′))⊆𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′′)), and
for all𝑖∈𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′)),𝑣′
𝑖=𝑣′′
𝑖and𝑟′
𝑖⊆𝑟′′
𝑖, we have𝑆(𝜃′)≤𝑆(𝜃′′).
Furthermore, if all the new participants have relatively small valuations, it should not affect the revenue of the
sponsor since they have no contribution. We call it revenue invariance .
Definition 3.7. A diffusion auction is revenue invariant if
•for all𝜃′,𝜃′′∈Θwith𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′))⊆𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′′)), and for all 𝑖∈𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′)),𝑣′
𝑖=𝑣′′
𝑖and𝑟′
𝑖⊆𝑟′′
𝑖;
•for all agents in 𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′′))\𝐷𝑠(𝐺(𝜃′)), any of them cannot be the winner even if we remove the winner and
all her critical ancestors under 𝜃′,
then we have 𝑆(𝜃′)=𝑆(𝜃′′).
It is easy to prove that almost all the existing auction mechanisms (with or without diffusion) [ 12,14,17,18], satisfy
revenue invariance.
Theorem 3.8. The instance of diffusion redistribution mechanism given by NRMF is non-deficit (ND) if the input
diffusion auctionM𝑎is revenue monotonic.
Proof. According to Lemma 3.3, we haveÍ
𝑖∈𝑁𝜔𝑖=1.
On the other hand, since M𝑎is revenue monotonic, then for each subtree 𝑇𝑚𝑘in the diffusion critical tree 𝑇(𝜃′), we
have𝐵𝑘≤𝑆𝑎(𝜃′). Hence,
𝑆(𝜃′)=∑︁
𝑖∈𝑁𝑥𝑖(𝜃′)=𝑆𝑎(𝜃′)−∑︁
𝑘∑︁
𝑖∈𝑇𝑚𝑘𝜔𝑖·𝐵𝑘
≥𝑆𝑎(𝜃′)−∑︁
𝑖∈𝑁𝜔𝑖·𝑆𝑎(𝜃′)=0
Therefore, the mechanism is non-deficit. □
Then we will discuss the properties of ABB and 𝜖-ABB. In the traditional setting, when we talk about ABB, the
increase of agents corresponds to the increase of the sponsor’s neighbours in our setting. However, on the social
networks, it is unreasonable to only increase sponsor’s neighbours. So the number of other agents’ neighbours on the
graph will grow together. Due to the existence of common neighbours, the increase of each agent’s neighbours on the
origin graph is hard to describe. So we will discuss agents that grow to infinity in the diffusion critical tree, which
reflects the invitation relationship in social networks. If all agents have the same probability of inviting someone new
in the critical tree, we define it as evenly growing.
11Definition 3.9. A diffusion critical tree 𝑇isevenly growing if for all subtree 𝑇𝑖⊂𝑇where𝑖∈𝑁, we have
lim𝑛→∞|𝑇𝑖|
𝑛=0.
Since the process of the diffusion auction is naturally seeking more agents, then we are also interested in the increase
of the agents as a continuous process, i.e., the sponsor’s neighbours are fixed and the critical tree only grows in height.
If assuming each neighbour of the sponsor have the same potential in terms of the number of agents in their leading
branches, we call the critical tree is branch-independent growing.
Definition 3.10. A diffusion critical tree 𝑇isbranch-independent growing if for all subtree 𝑇𝑖⊂𝑇rooted by𝑖∈ˆ𝑟𝑠,
we have
lim𝑛→∞|𝑇𝑖|
𝑛=1
|ˆ𝑟𝑠|.
Lemma 3.11. If a diffusion auction M𝑎is IR and ND, we have 0≤𝑆𝑎(𝜃′)≤𝑣, where𝑣is the upper bound of all possible
valuations1.
Proof. Since the the diffusion auction M𝑎is ND, we can get:
𝑆𝑎(𝜃′)≥0
We have mentioned in Theorem 3.2 that 𝜋𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)𝑣𝑖−𝑥𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)is the utility of agent 𝑖in the diffusion auction mechanism
M𝑎and it is non-negative when M𝑎is IR. So for agent 𝑤who wins the item, her 𝜋𝑎𝑤(𝜃′)=1and payment 𝑥𝑎𝑤(𝜃′)≤𝑣𝑤.
For others, they will not get the item and their payment 𝑥𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)≤0. Therefore,
𝑆𝑎(𝜃′)=∑︁
𝑖∈𝑁𝑥𝑎
𝑖(𝜃′)≤𝑣𝑤
The report valuations of all agents have a finite upper bound 𝑣(𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑖∈𝑁𝑣𝑖≤𝑣). Hence, 0≤𝑆𝑎(𝜃′)≤𝑣.
□
Theorem 3.12. If the input diffusion auction mechanism M𝑎is IR, non-deficit and revenue invariant, then the instance
of NRMF is
1.asymptotically budget-balanced (ABB) when the diffusion critical tree 𝑇(𝜃′)is evenly growing;
2.𝜖-asymptotically budget-balanced (𝜖-ABB) when the diffusion critical tree 𝑇(𝜃′)is branch-independent growing.
Proof. After we first run diffusion auction mechanism M𝑎on𝜃′,𝑇𝑚𝑤is the subtree that contains the item winner
and we can get 𝑆𝑎(𝜃′). Then when we remove the agents in 𝑇𝑚𝑤from the corresponding 𝐺(𝜃′)and runM𝑎again,
the new winner is in subtree 𝑇𝑚𝑤′. Agent𝑖∈𝑁\(𝑇𝑚𝑤∪𝑇𝑚𝑤′)will never be the item winner even if we remove the
agents in𝑇𝑚𝑤or𝑇𝑚𝑤′. Therefore, according to the definition of revenue invariance, the attendance of these agents
does not influence the revenue gained by the M𝑎. Hence, we can get 𝐵𝑘=𝑆𝑎(𝜃′)for𝑘∈{1,...,|ˆ𝑟𝑠|}\{𝑚𝑤,𝑚𝑤′}. Let
1Otherwise, the valuation can be infinity, which is not reasonable in practice.
12𝐵𝑚𝑤=𝑆𝑎(𝜃′′−𝑚𝑤)and𝐵𝑚′𝑤=𝑆𝑎(𝜃′′−𝑚𝑤′), and the remaining part of revenue that has not been redistributed is

According to the Lemma 3.11, 𝑆𝑎(𝜃′),𝑆𝑎(𝜃′′−𝑚𝑤)and𝑆𝑎(𝜃′′−𝑚𝑤′)are bounded. Obviously, (𝑆𝑎(𝜃′)−𝑆𝑎(𝜃′′−𝑚𝑤))and
(𝑆𝑎(𝜃′)−𝑆𝑎(𝜃′′−𝑚𝑤′))are also bounded.

4 INSTANCES OF THE REDISTRIBUTION MECHANISM FRAMEWORK
In our network-based redistribution mechanism framework, if we require the output mechanism to be IC and IR, then
the input diffusion auction mechanism should also be IC, IR and non-deficit. The largest known set of diffusion auction
mechanisms with the above properties is Critical Diffusion Mechanism (CDM) [ 13]. Especially, the first diffusion auction
mechanism, Incentive Diffusion Mechanism (IDM) [ 14] is also a member in CDM, which has the highest efficiency. In
this section, we input IDM and another mechanism in CDM called Threshold Neighbourhood Mechanism (TNM) [ 12]
into our framework to see the outcomes.
For convenience, we briefly introduce the idea of the IDM and TNM with our notations. Both IDM and TNM first
find the agent with the highest valuation and their critical ancestors. Then the mechanisms check these agents from the
sponsor to the agent with the highest valuation. For IDM, each agent will pay a certain amount to her critical parent,
13which is the highest valuation after removing herself from the graph. Then, she will acquire the item temporarily. If her
valuation is the highest after removing her critical descendants, she will be the winner and the mechanism terminates.
By contrast, agent under TNM will remove all her descendants (including non-critical ones) when we check the winner.
In addition, when agents get item, they will also pay the same amount of money as the IDM, but their critical parents
will just get the value of the highest valuation when we ignore all their descendants. The rest of the payments will be
directly given to the sponsor.

from a report profile 𝜃′. (2) is the corresponding graph 𝐺(𝜃′)under the diffusion action mechanism IDM, where the red arrows
mean the payment transfers of agents. The item is allocated to agent 𝐽. (3) is the corresponding graph 𝐺(𝜃′)under TNM. The red
arrows also mean the payment transfers of agents. However, the item is allocated to agent 𝐻which is the difference. (4) shows the
coefficients𝜔𝑖of agents and we set 𝛼=0.8. (5) and (6) shows the final utilities corresponding to IDM mechanism input and TNM
mechanism input respectively.
We show two running examples of the redistribution mechanism with IDM and TNM in Figure 5. Both IDM and
TNM first find the agent 𝐽who has the highest valuation. Then they check the critical path 𝑠→𝐴→𝐻→𝐽. Under
IDM, the item is allocated to the agent 𝐽and the sponsor’s revenue is 9. After removing the all agents in the subtree
rooted by agent 𝐴, the revenue gained by the sponsor under IDM is 7. Therefore, if we set 𝛼=0.8, the final utility of
agent𝐽is14−13+0.032×7=1.224. When it comes to TNM, the agent 𝐻will win the item because she is the agent
who reports the highest valuation after removing the agent 𝐽and𝐾on the critical path. 𝐻’s critical parent 𝐴will get
the highest valuation 9after removing all 𝐴’s descendants and the rest 1of𝐻’s payment will be directly given to the
sponsor. Similarly, after removing the all agents in the subtree rooted by 𝐴, sponsor still gets 7. The final utility of agent
𝐻is11−10+0.117×7=1.819.
145 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this paper, we focus on redistribution mechanism design on social networks, where a sponsor wants to incentivize
agents to invite their neighbours to participate in, and allocate a single item without seeking any profit. To achieve
the goal, we propose a network-based redistribution mechanism framework (NRMF) that can construct a diffusion
redistribution mechanism from any diffusion auction. The NRMF will maintain the properties of incentive compatibility
and individual rationality of the original diffusion auction, and also be non-deficit if the original diffusion auction is
revenue monotonic.
Moreover, without affecting the efficiency of the diffusion auction, NRMF can achieve the property of asymptotically
budget-balanced (ABB) or 𝜖-asymptotically budget-balanced. We consider ABB rather than budget-balance (BB), which
requires that all revenue be returned back to buyers ideally. It is common even under the traditional settings because
no mechanisms can satisfy all the properties of efficiency , IC, IR and BB according to Green-Laffont impossibility
theorem [ 4]. When it comes to our setting, the above impossibility theorem still holds. The reason is that the special
cases where all agents are directly connected to the sponsor in the network are equivalent to the cases in the traditional
settings. However, in diffusion auction mechanism design, efficiency is usually abandoned because it is even impossible
to design a diffusion auction mechanism that satisfies efficiency, IC, IR and non-deficit simultaneously [12].
If we require the output mechanism to be IC and IR in NRMF, then the input mechanism must be IC, IR and non-deficit.
The output redistribution mechanism achieves the same level of social welfare as the input mechanism.
In theory, without efficiency, the impossibility that BB cannot be achieved is missing in our setting. Actually, it is
possible to satisfy the properties of IC, IR and BB simultaneously. For example, when we input the fixed pricing diffusion
auction mechanisms into our framework, the corresponding output mechanisms are always BB. It is an interesting
future work that finding the relationship between the efficiency and the residual budget after the redistribution.
