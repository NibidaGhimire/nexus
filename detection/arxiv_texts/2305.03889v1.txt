Abstract
In 2012, L´ evˆ eque, Maﬀray, and Trotignon conjectured that e ach graph Gthat contains no
induced subdivision of K4is 4-colorable. In this paper, we prove that this conjecture holds w hen
Gcontains a K1,2,3.
Key Words : coloring; induced subgraphs.
1 Introduction
All graphs considered in this paper are ﬁnite, simple, and un directed. Let Gbe a graph. A proper
coloring ofGis an assignment of colors to the vertices of Gsuch that no two adjacent vertices
receive the same color. A graph is k-colorable if it has a proper coloring using at most kcolors. A
subdivision ofGis a graph obtained from Gby replacing the edges of Gwith independent paths
of length at least one between their end vertices. An ISK4is a graph that is isomorphic to a
subdivision of K4. For a graph H, we say that Gcontains HifHis isomorphic to an induced
subgraph of G, and otherwise, GisH-free. For a family Fof graphs, we say that GisF-freeifG
isF-free for every graph F∈ F.
Given a graph with a large chromatic number, it is natural to a sk whether it must contain
induced subgraphs with particular properties. A family Fof graphs is said to be χ-bounded if
there exists a function fsuch that for every graph G∈ F, every induced subgraph HofGsatisﬁes
χ(H)≤f(ω(H)). The notion of χ-bounded families was introduced by Gy´ arf´ as in [4]. Scott [8]
proposed the following conjecture: for every graph H, the class deﬁned by excluding all subdivision
ofHas induced subgraphs is χ-bounded, and proved this conjecture in the case that His a forest.
However, this conjecture was disproved by Pawlik et al. [7]. In 2012, L´ evˆ eque, Maﬀray, and

1Trotignon [6] showed that the chromatic number of ISK 4-free graphs is bounded by a constant c,
which implies that Scott’s Conjecture is true when H=K4. Since no example of an ISK 4-free
graph whose chromatic number is 5 or more is known, L´ evˆ eque , Maﬀray, and Trotignon [6] in 2012
proposed the following conjecture.
Conjecture 1.1. ([6], Conjecture 1.7.) Every ISK 4-free graph is 4-colorable.
L´ evˆ eque, Maﬀray, and Trotignon [6] proved that every {ISK4,wheel}-free graph is 3-colorable.
Trotignon andVuˇ skovi´ c [10]showedthat every ISK 4-freegraphwithgirthat least ﬁveis3-colorable.
In the same paper, they further conjectured that every {ISK4,triangle}-free graph is 3-colorable,
which was proved by Chudnovsky et al. [2] in 2019. Le [5] showe d that every {ISK4,triangle}-free
graph is 4-colorable and every ISK 4-free graph is 24-colorable. Chen et al. [1] improved Le’s up per
bound to 8. In this paper, we prove
Theorem 1.2. For every ISK 4-free graph G, ifGcontains a K1,2,3, thenGis4-colorable.
2 Preliminary
Acycleis a connected 2-regular graph. Let Gbe a graph. For any u,v∈V(G), we often use
u∼vto denote uv∈E(G), andu≁vto denote uv /∈E(G). For any U⊆V(G), letG[U] be the
subgraph of Ginduced on U. For any vertex disjoint subgraphs HandH′ofG, if there are no
edges between HandH′, we say they are anticomplete ; and if each vertex in V(H) is adjacent to
all vertices in V(H), we say they are complete. LetNG(H) be the set of vertices in V(G)−V(H)
that have a neighbour in H. We say that NG(H′)∩V(H) is theattachment ofH′toH. We say
that an induced path Pwith ends v1,v2is adirect connection linkingHandH′ifv1is the only
vertex in V(P) having a neighbour in V(H) andv2is the only vertex in V(P) having a neighbour
inV(H′). For any x,y,z∈V(G), letdG(x,y) denote the length of a shortest ( x,y)-path in G.
LetPbe an (x,y)-path and Qa (y,z)-path. When PandQare internally disjoint paths, let PQ
denote the ( x,z)-pathP∪Q. Evidently, PQis a path when x/ne}ationslash=z, andPQis a cycle when x=z.
Whenu,v∈V(P), letP(u,v) denote the subpath of Pwith ends u,v. When there is no confusion,
all subscripts are omitted.
Given an induced cycle CofGand a vertex v∈V(G)−V(C), the vertex vislinked to Cif
there are three induced paths P1,P2,P3such that
•V(P∗
1∪P∗
2∪P∗
3) is disjoint from V(C);
•eachPihasvas its one end and the other end in V(C), and there are no other edges between
PiandC;
•for 1≤i < j≤3, we have V(Pi)∩V(Pj) ={v};
•ifx∈V(Pi) is adjacent to y∈V(Pj), then either v∈ {x,y}or{x,y} ⊆V(C); and
•ifvhas a neighbour c∈V(C), thenc∈V(Pi) for some i.
2Lemma 2.1 obviously holds, which will be used frequently wit hout reference.
Lemma 2.1. ([2], Lemma 9.) If Gis an ISK 4-free graph, then no vertex of Gcan be linked to an
induced cycle of G.
3 Proof of Theorem 1.2
To prove Theorem 1.2, we need a characterization of {ISK4,K3,3,K2,2,2,prisms}-free graphs con-
taining a K1,2,3.
Lemma 3.1. LetGbe an{ISK4,K3,3,K2,2,2}-free graph and Hbe a maximal induced K1,2,ninG
withn≥2. Letvbe a vertex in V(G)−V(H). Then the attachment of vtoHis either empty, or
consists of one vertex or of one edge.
Proof.LetA1={a},A2={b1,b2}andA3={c1,c2,...,cn}be the three sides of the tripartition
ofH. SinceGhas no ISK 4, the following obviously holds.
3.1.1.Ifvhas a neighbour in Ai,Aj, thenvis anti-complete to Ak, where{i,j,k}={1,2,3}.
3.1.2.Whenv∼a, Lemma 3.1 holds.
Subproof. Without loss ofgenerality wemay assumethat vhasaneighbourin A2∪A3, for otherwise
Lemma 3.1 holds. Assume that v∼b1. Thenvis anti-complete to A3by 3.1.1. By the maximality
ofH, we have v≁b2, soN(v)∩V(H) ={a,b1}. That is, Lemma 3.1 holds. Hence, we may assume
thatvis anti-complete to A2. By symmetry we may assume that n≥3,c1∼v∼c2andv≁c3,
for otherwise the lemma holds. Then c1is linked to b1c2b2c3b1, which is a contradiction.
By 3.1.2, we may assume that v≁a.
3.1.3.Ifvhas a neighbour in A2andA3, then Lemma 3.1 holds.
Subproof. Without loss of generality we may assume that b1∼v∼c1. Assume that v∼b2. Since
vis not linked to b1c1b2cifor each 2 ≤i≤n, we have v∼ci. That is, vis complete to A2∪A3, so
Gcontains a K2,2,2, which is a contradiction. Hence, v≁b2. Sincevis not linked to b1c1b2cifor
each 2≤i≤n, we have v≁ci. SoN(v)∩V(H) ={b1,c1}.
By 3.1.2 and 3.1.3, we may assume that |N(v)∩V(H)| ≥2 andN(v)∩V(H)⊆Aifor some
2≤i≤3. When Ai=A2, sinceAi=N(v)∩V(H), the vertex c1is linked to vb1ab2v. Similarly,
we can show that Ai/ne}ationslash=A3This proves Lemma 3.1.
If a graph has a unique cycle, we say that it is unicyclic . Aprismis a graph consisting of three
vertex disjoint paths P1=x1...y1,P2=x2...y2, andP3=x3...y3of length at least one, such
thatx1x2x3andy1y2y3are triangles and there are no edges between these paths exce pt those of
the two triangles.
3Lemma 3.2. LetGbe an{ISK4,K3,3,K2,2,2,prisms}-free graph and Hbe a maximal induced
subgraph of Gthat is isomorphic to a K1,2,nfor some integer n≥3. LetA1,A2,A3be the three
sides of the tripartition of Hwith|A1|= 1,|A2|= 2and|A3|=n. IfG/ne}ationslash=H, then the attachment
ofCtoHis either empty, a clique or A1∪A2for any component CofG−V(H).
Proof.SetA1:={a},A2:={b1,b2}andA3:={c1,c2,...,cn}. LetCbea component of G−V(H).
Assume that the attachment of CtoHis neither empty nor a clique.
3.2.1.ahas a neighbour in V(C).
Subproof. Assume not. Since the attachment of CtoHis not a clique, there are x1,x2∈Aihaving
a neighbour in V(C) for some 2 ≤i≤3. Lety1,y2∈V(C) withy1∼x1andy2∼x2. By
Lemma 3.1, y1/ne}ationslash=y2. LetPbe a shortest ( y1,y2)-path in C. Without loss of generality we may
assume that ( x1,x2,y1,y2) is chosen such that Pis minimum. When some vertex y∈V(Aj) is
anti-complete to P, sinceahas no neighbour in V(C), the vertex yis linked to ax1y1Py2x2a, where
{i,j}={2,3}. So each vertex in V(Aj) has a neighbour in V(P). By the choice of ( x1,x2,y1,y2),
we have that Ai=A3,A3−{x1,x2}is anti-complete to P, and by symmetry we may assume that
{yk}=N(bk)∩V(P) for each 1 ≤k≤2. For any x3∈A3− {x1,x2}, since{a,x3}andPare
anti-complete, x3is linked to ab1y1Py2b2a, which is a contradiction.
3.2.2.a∈V(H)∩N(C)⊆A1∪Aifor some integer 2≤i≤3.
Subproof. By 3.2.1, we have a∈V(H)∩N(C). Letx∈A2∪A3have a neighbour in V(C). Let
y1,y2∈V(C) withy1∼aandy2∼x. Note that y1maybe equal to y2. LetPbe a shortest
(y1,y2)-path in C. Without loss of generality we may assume that xis chosen such that |V(P)|
is minimum. Assume that x∈Aifor some 2 ≤i≤3. Set{i,j}={2,3}. Since 3.2.2 holds
whenAjandCare anti-complete, there is a vertex x′∈AjwithN(x′)∩V(C)/ne}ationslash=∅. When x′
has a neighbour in V(P), by the choice of x, we have {y2}=N(x′)∩V(P), sox′is linked to
ay1Py2xa, which is a contradiction. So x′has no neighbour in V(P). LetQbe a direct connection
linkingx′andPwithQ⊂C. Then |V(Q)| ≥1 asx′has no neighbour in V(P). Letqbe
the end of Qthat has a neighbour in V(P). By the choice of P, either|N(q)∩V(P)|= 1 or
{q1,q2} ⊆N(q)∩V(P) =V(P(q1,q2)) with 1 ≤dP(q1,q2)≤2. No matter which case happens,
G[V(P)∪{a,x,x′}] contains an ISK 4or a prism as |V(Q)| ≥1, which is a contradiction.
3.2.3.|V(H)∩N(C)|= 3.
Subproof. Assume not. Since V(H)∩N(C) is not a clique, by 3.2.2, a∈V(H)∩N(C)⊆A1∪A3
and|A3∩N(C)| ≥3. By symmetry we may assume that c1,c2,c3∈N(C). LetKbe a minimal
connected induced subgraph of Gwith{c1,c2,c3} ⊂V(K) andK− {c1,c2,c3} ⊆C. SinceK
is unicyclic, a path or a subdivision of K1,3whose degree-1 vertices are in {c1,c2,c3}, the graph
G[V(K)∪A2] contains an ISK 4or aK3,3, which is not possible.
Assume that V(H)∩N(C) ={a,c1,c2}. LetPbe an induced ( c1,c2)-path with interior in C.
ThenG[V(P)∪A2∪{c3}] is an ISK 4, which is not possible. So V(H)∩N(C) =A1∪A2by 3.2.2
and 3.2.3. That proves Lemma 3.2.
4LetGbe a graph. For any integer k≥0, ak-cutsetinGis a subset S⊂V(G) of size ksuch
thatG−Sis disconnected. A proper2-cutsetofGis a 2-cutset {a,b}such that a≁b,V(G)−{a,b}
can be partitioned into two non-empty sets XandYso thatXandYare anticomplete and neither
G[X∪{a,b}] norG[Y∪{a,b}] is an (a,b)-path. A square S={v1,v2,v3,v4}is an induced cycle
Cof length four such that v1,v2,v3,v4occur on Cin this order. A linkofSis an induced path
Pwith ends p,p′such that either p=p′andN(p) =SorN(p) ={v1,v2}andN(p′) ={v3,v4},
and there are no edges between Sand the interior vertices of P. Arich square is a graph Kthat
contains a square Ssuch that there are at least two components in K−S, each of which is a link
ofS. Evidently, K2,2,2is the smallest rich square.
Lemma 3.3. ([6], Lemma 3.3.) Let Gbe an ISK 4-free graph that contains a K3,3. Then either G
has a clique cutset of size at most three, or Gis complete bipartite or complete tripartite.
Lemma 3.4. ([6]) Let Gbe an ISK 4-free graph. If Gcontains a prism or a rich square, then Gis
the line graph of a graph with maximum degree 3or a rich square, or Ghas a clique cutset of size
at most three, or Ghas a proper 2-cutset.
Lemma 3.5. ([5]) IfGis the line graph of a graph with maximum degree 3or a rich square, then
χ(G)≤4.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. Assume that Theorem 1.2 is not true. Let Gbe a minimal counterexample
to this theorem. Then χ(G) = 5 and Ghas neither a proper 2-cutset nor a clique cutset. By
Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5, Gis{K2,2,2,prisms}-free. By Lemma 3.3, GisK3,3-free. Let Hbe a maximal
induced subgraph of Gthat is isomorphic to a K1,2,nfor some integer n≥3. LetA1,A2andA3be
the three sides of the tripartition of Hwith|A1|= 1,|A2|= 2 and |A3|=n. Evidently, G/ne}ationslash=Hand
χ(G−A3)≥4, for otherwise χ(G)≤χ(G−A3)+1≤4. Since Gis connected and has no clique
cutset, by Lemma 3.2, the attachment of CtoHisA1∪A2for any component CofG−V(H).
Thenχ(G−A3) =χ(G) asχ(G−A3)≥4, which is a contradiction to the minimality of G.
