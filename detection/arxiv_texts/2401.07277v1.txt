Abstract
In this work, we study the phenomenology of neutrinos and the formation of cosmic domain walls in
the NMSSM extended by an A4×Z3flavor symmetry. Neutrino masses result from the type I seesaw
mechanism using only two flavon fields and the NMSSM singlet Swhile their mixing is of Trimaximal
mixing form. We perform our phenomenological study in the normal mass hierarchy where we find that
observables like mββ,mβ, and∑mican be tested by future experiments. Due to the difference between
theA4subgroups that undergo spontaneous breaking in both the charged lepton and neutrino sectors, the
resulting domain walls in each sector exhibit distinct structures. We delve into the details of the breaking
patterns within these two sectors, and we introduce a nuanced geometric representation for them. To tackle
the domain wall problem, we explore a well-established method involving the explicit breaking of the
flavor symmetry. This is achieved through the introduction of Planck-suppressed operators induced by
supergravity.

1. INTRODUCTION
The interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), discrete symmetries, and the flavor problem is a fascinating aspect
of particle physics, where theoretical models seek to explain observed phenomena at the quantum level. In particular, addressing
the hierarchical structure and mixing patterns in fermion masses beyond the Standard Model (SM) presents a prominent challenge
in particle physics. Non-Abelian flavor symmetries play a crucial role in addressing the flavor problem, and their use in model
building became common after the observation of large leptonic mixing angles by neutrino oscillation experiments [1–3]. The
SSB of these discrete symmetries is the most important ingredient to achieve realistic fermion masses and mixing angles at low
energies. It is achieved when gauge singlet flavon fields, which transform non-trivially under the flavor symmetry, acquire vacuum
expectations values (VEVs) along specific directions in flavon space.
On the other hand, the SSB of discrete symmetries leads to the formation of two-dimensional defects, called domain walls (DWs)
with potential cosmological implications [4, 5]. These DWs form at the boundaries of distinct degenerate vacua created during the
phase transition associated with SSB. In the context of non-Abelian discrete symmetries, SSB typically occurs partially, resulting in
residual subgroups within different fermion sectors due to the VEV alignments of flavon fields. The number of degenerate vacua is
determined by the order of the broken subgroups, while the regions between these vacua represent the DWs whose energy density
may conflict with cosmological observations if it dominates the total energy density of the Universe. This happens in the so-called
scaling regime in which the energy density of DWs scales in terms of the cosmological expansion factor a(t)asa−1[6–8], decreasing
more slowly than radiation (scaling as a−4) or matter (scaling as a−3) [4, 5, 9]. Basically, if the flavor-breaking scale is comparable
to the inflationary scale, it is reasonable to assume that the Universe has expanded enough for the walls to be inflated beyond the
present horizon. However, if the flavor-breaking scale is lower than the inflationary scale, the energy density of the walls becomes
the subdominant contribution to the total energy density of the Universe [10, 11]; this is known as the DW problem [4].
In this paper, based on our recent works [12, 13], we investigate the predictions of neutrino masses and mixing within the
framework of a flavored next-to-minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (FNMSSM), where the flavor symmetry is given by
GF=A4×Z3. The motivation behind the NMSSM comes from the consequences associated with its singlet superfield, see Refs.
[14–16] for more details. In our scenario, to achieve realistic light neutrino masses through the type I seesaw mechanism, three
right-handed neutrinos and two flavon fields are introduced. Meanwhile, the NMSSM singlet Splays a crucial role in achieving
neutrino mixing that aligns with the Trimaximal mixing matrix [17–23]. We have studied numerically the phenomenology associ-
ated with neutrino sector in the normal mass hierarchy (NH) case. We found that upcoming experiments can test our predictions
for the effective Majorana mass mββrelevant for neutrinoless double beta decay experiments (0 νββ), the effective mass of electron
antineutrinos mβmeasured in beta decay experiments, and the total mass of the three active neutrinos constrained by cosmological
observations.

Furthermore, we investigate the partial breaking of A4, and we focus on patterns with two different residual symmetries1:A4→
Z3in the charged lepton sector and A4→Z2in the neutrino sector. For the first breaking pattern, the broken part of A4is given by
the Klein four group Z2×Z2of order four. In this case, DWs manifest as boundaries that separate four degenerate vacua. For the
second breaking pattern, the broken part of A4is given by the non-Abelian group Z2×Z3of order six. In this case, DWs manifest
as boundaries that separate six degenerate vacua. By representing the degenerate vacua as vectors in flavon space, we observe that
DW networks in both sectors can be represented by Platonic solids: a Tetrahedron for A4→Z3and an Octahedron for A4→Z2. In
the charged lepton sector, DWs emerge around the inflationary scale without conflicting with cosmological observations. However,
in the neutrino sector, the breaking occurs below the inflationary scale, requiring the annihilation of corresponding DWs before
the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis according to standard cosmology. Following Ref. [4], we show that explicitly breaking the
Z2⋊Z3subgroup of A4at high energy using Planck-suppressed higher-dimensional operators can eliminate the degeneracy among
the six degenerate vacua. Notably, the low-energy behavior of the theory remains mostly unchanged as long as these operators are
suppressed by powers of the Planck scale.
2. IMPLEMENTING A4IN THE LEPTON SECTOR OF THE FNMSSM
In this section, we examine the neutrino masses and mixing within the framework of the FNMSSM where the flavor symmetry
is given by Gf=A4×Z3. In order to account for neutrino oscillation data, the A4group must undergo spontaneous breaking,
resulting in the emergence of cosmic domain walls. The Z3symmetry, on the other hand, is primarily introduced to distinguish
between the flavon superfields used in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors. A4has four irreducible representations: one triplet
and three singlets which we denote here by their basis characters as 3(−1,0),1(1,1),1(1,ω)and1(1,ω2). This notation provides a
nuanced approach for differentiating the three one-dimensional representations by the characters of the two generators of A4(see
Ref. [24] and appendix for more details). In order to prevent any confusion between the characters associated with the additional
Z3and the Z3subgroup of A4, we represent the three one-dimensional representations of the former as 11,1Qand1Q2, where
Q=e2πi/3.
By focusing on the lepton sector, our FNMSSM prototype incorporates, in addition to the conventional superfields of the MSSM
and the NMSSM singlet Sthe following additional superfields: (1) three right handed neutrinos Nc
i= (Nc
1,Nc
2,Nc
3)essential for
generating neutrino masses through the type-I seesaw mechanism, and (2) three flavon superfields denoted as Φ,Ω, and χ. These
flavon are necessary for generating appropriate neutrino masses and mixing, as well as contributing to the resolution of the DW
problem. The quantum numbers for both the additional fields and the MSSM fields under the SU(2)L×U(1)Yand the A4×Z3
symmetries are detailed in Table 1. By using these field transformations, the most general chiral superpotential for leptons invariant

where Lidenotes the three left handed lepton doublets, Ec
j= (ec,µc,τc)is the three right handed charged leptons, and Huand
Hdare the two Higgs doublets of the MSSM. The first term in Eq. 1 is responsible for the charged lepton masses, the second term
gives rise to the Dirac mass matrix, while the remaining terms are responsible for RH neutrino masses. Following the breaking of
gauge and flavor symmetries, the masses of charged leptons and neutrinos are obtained through their interactions with the scalar
components of the scalar superfields. The specific VEV alignments that adhere to neutrino data and minimize the scalar potential
of the model are given by
⟨Φ⟩=υΦ(1, 0, 0 ),⟨Ω⟩=υΩ(1, 1, 1 ),⟨χ⟩=υχ,

Then, according to the superfield transformations in Table 1 and the A4tensor product rules given in the appendix, the charged

For neutrinos, the Majorana mass matrix MRexhibits the magic symmetry referring to the fact that the sum of each column and
row is equal [25]. This type of matrices are diagonalized by the well-known Trimaximal mixing matrix defined as [17–23]

The parameters a,band ϵinMRhave a dimension of mass and at least one of them must be complex in order to account for
CPviolation in the lepton sector. The optimal choice can be deduced by noticing that when ϵ→0,MRis diagonalized by the
tribimaximal mixing (TBM) matrix which is known to be incompatible with the present neutrino oscillation data and it is CP
conserving [26]. Therefore, ϵis responsible for a small deviation of the neutrino mixing angles from their TBM values and it is taken
to be complex ( ϵ=|ϵ|eiϕϵ) to account for the CPviolation in the neutrino sector. Moreover, since this parameter is proportional to
the VEV of the NMSSM singlet Sknown to acquire a VEV of the order of MSUSY , the modulus of ϵmust satisfy: |ϵ|<a,b. Now,
let us proceed to compute the masses, starting with the three Majorana masses Mi=1,2,3. These masses are determined through
the diagonalization of the right-handed neutrino mass matrix MRusing the Trimaximal mixing matrix as (U∗

At this point, we can calculate the light neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw mechanism formula mν=mT

TM 2)T. Moreover, due to the form of the Dirac mass matrix MD, see Eq. 3, the diagonalization of
mνremains of Trimaximal form, but with the interchange of the second and the third row of UTM 2. We shall denote the new form
of the Trimaximal mixing matrix as ˜UTM 2and thus, the light neutrino masses are given by (˜UTM 2)Tmν˜UTM 2=diag(m1,m2,m3)
where mi=Y2
0υ2u/Mi. To make our upcoming numerical study more straightforward, we redefine these masses as a function of
O(1)parameters as follows
m1=2m0

kab+kϵb,m3=2m0
2−2kab+kϵb, (8)
where m0=Y2
0υ2u/b,kab=a/band kϵb=|ϵ|/b. Regarding the neutrino mixing angles, we can easily derive their expressions
from their respective definitions: sin2θ13=|˜Ue3|2, sin2θ12=|˜Ue2|2/(1− |˜Ue3|2), and sin2θ23=|˜Uµ3|2/(1− |˜Ue3|2), where ˜Ue2,
˜Ue3and ˜Uµ3represent the (12), (13) and (23) entries of the Trimaximal mixing matrix ˜UTM 2, respectively. Thus, we conclude that
the expression for these mixing angles are given by

3. DOMAIN WALLS FROM SPONTANEOUS BREAKING OF A4
In this section, we examine the formation of DWs and depict them geometrically in the context of two A4breaking patterns, i.e.
A4→Z3,A4→Z2. To simplify things, we use the fact that A4is isomorphic to (Z2×Z2)⋊Z3, where (Z2×Z2)is the Klein
four-group which will be referred to as K4in subsequent discussions. Let us start by delving into the different breaking patterns
within the basis provided in equation A.1 of the appendix:
•A4→Z3: Let us denote the isomorphic group of A4asA4∼=ZS
2×ZTST2
2⋊ZT
3where the exponents represent the generator
for each abelian subgroup of A4. Accordingly, the breaking pattern A4→ZT
3is realized in the charged leptons sector
3Andromeda Proceedings BSM 2023, Hurghada, Egypt
when the flavon triplet Φacquires its VEV along the direction ⟨Φ⟩= (1, 0, 0 )T. This can be easily checked using the matrix
representations for the generators Sand Tprovided in the appendix where we find
S⟨Φ⟩̸=⟨Φ⟩,TST2⟨Φ⟩̸=⟨Φ⟩,T⟨Φ⟩=⟨Φ⟩. (10)
This equation makes it clear that among the symmetries, only ZT
3remains unbroken. On the other hand, the part that un-
dergoes breaking is given by the Klein four group K4=ZS
2×ZTST2
2. It is crucial to emphasize that choosing the third ZT2ST
2
subgroup within A4instead of either ZS
2orZTST2
2yields to the same outcomes. This arise because the generator T2STof this
group does not preserve the VEV of Φ, i.e. T2ST⟨Φ⟩̸=⟨Φ⟩. On the other hand, we cannot choose the other three Z3sub-
groups within A4–namely ZST
3,ZTS
3and ZSTS
3–instead of ZT
3. This is because they all modify the VEV structure of Φleading
to the breaking of the Z3symmetry, i.e. ST⟨Φ⟩̸=⟨Φ⟩,TS⟨Φ⟩̸=⟨Φ⟩and STS⟨Φ⟩̸=⟨Φ⟩.
•A4→Z2: We employ the same generators for the isomorphic group as in the previous breaking pattern. Let us assume that
the residual symmetry is the ZS
2group. Thus, the breaking pattern A4→ZS
2in the neutrino sector is realized when the
flavon triplet Ωacquires its VEV along the direction ⟨Ω⟩= (1, 1, 1 )T. As in the previous case, we can verify this breaking
pattern using the matrix representations for the generators Sand T, and show that the only conserved symmetry is the that
of the generator S. We have
S⟨Ω⟩=⟨Ω⟩,TST2⟨Ω⟩̸=⟨Ω⟩,T⟨Ω⟩̸=⟨Ω⟩. (11)
This breaking pattern does not occur when considering the residual group as either of the remaining two Z2subgroups
within A4, namely ZTST2
2and ZT2ST
2. This restriction arises from the fact that both of these subgroups undergo breaking due
to the VEV direction of Ω. Conversely, choosing any of the alternate Z3subgroups within A4instead of ZT
3poses no issue,
as they are also broken by the VEV of Ω. Specifically, conditions such as ST⟨Ω⟩̸=⟨Ω⟩,TS⟨Ω⟩̸=⟨Ω⟩, and STS⟨Ω⟩̸=⟨Ω⟩
are satisfied.
•A4→K4: The A4group has only one K4subgroup generated by {S,TST2}. As we showed in the previous breaking patterns,
the action of TST2on⟨Φ⟩and⟨Ω⟩modifies the VEV directions of the flavon triplets. Consequently, these flavon triplets
cannot be employed for the breaking pattern A4→K4. On the other hand, this breaking pattern can be realized by any
scalar field transforming as a nontrivial singlet. Indeed, the VEV of the NMSSM singlet Stransforming as 1(1,ω2)remains
unchanged under the operations of the generators of K4(Sand TST2). As a result, ⟨S⟩breaks A4down to its Klein four
group K4. In this case, the broken part corresponds to the abelian group Z3, and it can be chosen from any of the four Z3
subgroups within A4, given that their generators all modify the VEV of the NMSSM singlet, i.e. T⟨S⟩̸=⟨S⟩,ST⟨S⟩̸=⟨S⟩,
TS⟨S⟩̸=⟨S⟩, and STS⟨S⟩̸=⟨S⟩. It is important to note that this discussion is purely based on mathematical considerations
and that these four Z3subgroups of A4are conjugate to each other. However, once a generator is chosen for a subgroup, it
must be consistently maintained throughout the analysis.
Now, we examine the induced DWs within both the charged lepton and neutrino sectors, illustrating a nuanced approach to
geometrically represent them for each breaking pattern. Given that these breaking patterns emerge when flavon fields attain VEVs
along particular directions within the flavon space, it is essential to accurately define this space in which we will depict the DWs.
Since there are two possible dimensions for the irreducible representations of A4, our approach revolves around visualizing the
flavon space as a (3+1)-dimensional vector space denoted by Vin what follows. Here, 3 and 1 represent the dimensions of the
triplet and the singlets of A4, respectively. Consider the components of this vector space labeled as V= (X1,X2,X3,X4)∈C4
where the Xi’s stand for a system of vector basis with the first three components are reserved for A4triplets, while the forth one is
designated for A4singlets. Thus, the nontrivial scalar superfields ΦandΩalong with the NMSSM singlet Sare expanded within
the flavon space in terms of the components of the complex 4Dvector space Vas3Φ∼ΦiXi,Ω∼ΩiXi, andS=SX4where
i=1, 2, 3. Representing DWs graphically becomes a challenging task due to the complex nature of these superfields and their
scalar components that acquire VEVs. Hence, to represent the DWs by real geometrical objects such as real quivers, we adopt the
methodology outlined in Refs. [12, 13]. This relies on splitting the components of the scalar superfields and the vector space Vinto
real and imaginary parts as ϕk=ℜ(ϕk) +iℑ(ϕk)and Vk=ℜ(Uk) +iℑ(Rk)where k=1, 2, 3, 4 while Ukand Vkare real 4Dvectors
forming the constituents of Xkexpressed as Xk= (Uk,Rk)T. Accordingly, the complex 4Dexpansion ϕ∼ϕkXkis expressed with
this splitting as a real 8Dvector given by
ϕ∼∑
k[ℜ(ϕk)Uk+ℑ(ϕk)Rk]∈R8, with k=1, 2, 3, 4. (12)
Let us elaborate on this by considering a specific example of a VEV direction with complex entries. Assuming a breaking pattern
ofA4→ZTS
3. Given the generator TSofZ3, this breaking occurs when a flavon triplet φ, attains a VEV along the direction
⟨φ⟩=υφ(1,−2ω,−2ω2)Twhere ω=−1/2+i√
3/2. In this scenario, the representation of ⟨φ⟩in the real basis is expressed as 6D
vector in R6
⟨φ⟩=υφ(1, 0, 1, −√
3, 1,√
3). (13)
3Generally, we can use a collective flavon superfield ϕ∼ϕkXkwhere k=1, 2, 3, 4. Hence, we may think of the linear combinations of these X′scomponents as
forming the basis of the the flavon space.

Geometrically, the flavon VEV responsible for the breaking of A4can be represented as a vector aligned along one of the real
directions within the vector space ( Uk,Rk) where the components of the vector correspond to its coordinates within this space.
Then, the transformations imposed on the flavon VEV by the elements of the A4group result in the establishment of coordinates
for the remaining vertices, eventually shaping a polygon within the vector space ( Uk,Rk). The number of vertices equals to the
number of degenerate vacua, i.e. the order of the broken group. Let us explore this in our model for the breaking patterns realized
in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors. As explained previously, the breaking pattern A4→ZT
3manifests in the charged leptons
FIGURE 1: A regular Tetrahedron (left) and a regular Octahedron (right) viewed from the flavon space. The vertices represent

sector when the flavon triplet Φobtains a VEV along the direction ⟨Φ⟩=υΦ(1, 0, 0 )T. This breaking scenario can be represented
asZS
2×ZTST2
2⋊ZT
3→ZT
3, where the broken subgroup ZS
2×ZTST2
2is isomorphic to the Klein four group K4with an order of four.
Consequently, there exist four degenerate vacua {ϕ1,ϕ2,ϕ3,ϕ4}associated with this breaking pattern, situated within the flavon
space. These vacua collectively define the vertices of a Platonic solid, specifically a Tetrahedron, as depicted in the left panel of Fig.
1. One of the vertices of the Tetrahedron corresponds to the K4-invariant vacuum employed in the A4→ZT
3breaking. To derive
the remaining three vacua, we apply the generators of K4to⟨Φ⟩as follows
ϕ1=⟨Φ⟩,ϕ2=S⟨Φ⟩,ϕ3=TST2⟨Φ⟩,ϕ4=T2ST⟨Φ⟩, (14)
Using the matrix representations of the generators Sand Tin Eq. A.1 of the appendix, it is easy to deduce the expressions of these
vacua in the complex three-dimensional space C3

These four vectors satisfy the constraint ∑4

These edges represent the DWs separating the vacua as illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 1. Moreover, by examining these vectors,
it is clear that the structure resembles a regular Tetrahedron where all sides form equilateral triangles, and we have confirmed that
all edges share the same length, specifically υΦ√
8/3.
In the neutrino sector, the breaking pattern A4→ZS
2is realized when the flavon triplet Ωacquires a VEV along the direction
⟨Ω⟩=υΦ(1, 1, 1 )T. This breaking can be expressed as ZS

12 edges. These edges represent the DWs separating the vacua as illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 1. Let us verify some of the
properties of this regular Octahedron using the six vacua in Eq. (19). Consider the equal edge lengths of the regular Octahedron
(right panel of Fig. 1); for instance, in the right triangular face defined by vertices {ϕ′

4. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND SOLUTION TO THE DOMAIN WALL PROBLEM
This section comprises two parts. The first one is devoted to a numerical analysis of the neutrino sector, with a focus on neutrino
oscillation parameters and observables associated with neutrino masses, namely mββ,mβ, and∑mi. The second part is dedicated
to presenting a solution to the DW problem.
4.1. Neutrino phenomenology
The current neutrino oscillation data exhibit a slight inclination towards the normal neutrino mass hierarchy with m1being the
lightest neutrino mass. Consequently, our numerical investigation will be conducted within the NH framework. Let us start by
fixing our model parameters given by m0,kab,kϵb,θ,σand ϕϵ. The parameters m0,kab,kϵbare allowed to varie in the ranges
[0, 1],[0, 1]and[−1, 1], respectively. The parameter θis varied in the range [0,π/2]while the phases σand ϕϵare randomly
varied in the range [0, 2π]. Using the 3 σallowed range of the mixing angles from NuFit 5.0 global analysis [27] as input, and
the their expressions in Eq. 9, we can easily fix the Trimaximal parameters θand σ. In the middle panel of Fig. 2, we depict
the correlation between sin2θ23andσwith the color bar showing the values of θ. The obtained ranges for these parameters are:
sin2θ23∈[0.415, 0.610 ],θ∈[0.175, 0, 191 ]andσ∈[0.001, 6, 270 ], while the entire range of ϕϵis permissible. From the range of
sin2θ23, we deduce that both octants of the atmospheric angle are allowed in this model. In the left panel of Fig. 2, we show the

constrained using the current 3 σallowed range of the mass squared differences ∆m2

31where we find the following ranges:
kab∈[0.634, 0.888 ],kϵb∈[−0.634, 0.634 ]and m0[GeV]∈[0.007, 0.039 ]. Regarding the size of CPviolation in the lepton sector, it
can be measured using the Jarlskog invariant parameter expressed in the Particle Data Group (PDG) standard parametrization
asJCP=1
8sin 2θ12sin 2θ13sin 2θ23cosθ13sinδCPwhere δCPis the CPviolating phase [28]. In the right panel of Fig. 2, we show a
scatter plot of JCPversus δCPwhile the color bar displays the 3 σallowed values of sin2θ13. The obtained range for the Jarlskog
invariant parameter is JCP∈[−0.035, 0, 030 ]. In the case of the Trimaximal mixing matrix ˜UTM 2, the Jarlskog parameter is expressed
asJTM 2
CP=−(1/6√
3)sin 2θ23sinσ. By matching this expression with the one provided by the PDG, a relationship emerges among
the atmospheric angle, the Dirac CPphase, and σ
sinσ=−sin 2θ23sinδCP. (20)
By considering this equation and the 3 σallowed ranges for the atmospheric angle and the Dirac CPphase, we find that the exact
value of nπforσandδCPis excluded, with ncan be any integer. Hence, it is evident from Eq. 20 that the CPconserving values of
δCPare not allowed in the current model, which implies also that the Jarlskog invariant parameter remains nonzero, leading to the
inevitable presence of CPviolation in the current model.
Now, we proceed to investigate the absolute neutrino mass spectrum through scatter plots. To determine all three neutrino
masses in the NH case, we represent m2and m3in terms of the lightest neutrino mass m1, namely m2= (m2

The upper value for ∑mialigns with the upper limit reported by the Planck collaboration [29]. However, the lower value ∼0.063 eV
requires additional investigations, and may be tested in future experiments, such as CORE+BAO which aim to achieve a sensitivity
of 0.062 eV[30]. There are two additional avenues for exploring the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. The first one involves a direct
determination through the measurement of the electron energy spectrum near its endpoint region. This method currently stands as
the most sophisticated means to determine the effective electron antineutrino mass; it is expressed as m2
β=∑im2
i|Uei|2. The second
method relies on the search for 0 νββ processes whose decay amplitude is proportional to the effective Majorana neutrino mass
defined as |mββ|=|∑iU2
eimi|. These two parameters can be represented as functions of the model parameters by substituting the
neutrino masses with their expressions from Eq. 8 in the following relations

It is important to note that the 0 νββ decay processes serve as a means to probe the Majorana nature of neutrinos. Consequently, the
expression for |mββ|in Eq. 22 incorporates two additional Majorana phases, namely αandβ. In Fig. 3, the middle panel displays
the correlation between mβand m1, and the right panel shows the correlation between mββand m1. These scatter plots emerge
from varying the oscillation parameters within their 3 σrange, while the Majorana phases are varied in the range of [0, 2π]. The
predicted values for these observables are given by
0.009≲mβ[eV]≲0.031, 0.000049 ≲|mββ|[eV]≲0.02963 (23)
The values of mβare considerably smaller than the KATRIN sensitivity ( ∼0.2eV) [31], making them challenging to test in the near
future. Nevertheless, the upper limit of mβis close to the expected sensitivity of the Project 8 collaboration ∼0.04 eV(depicted
by the blue dashed line in the middle panel of Fig. 3) [32]. Consequently, future experiments with improved sensitivities could
potentially reach this upper bound. Formββ, the dashed lines in the right panel of Fig. 3 show that our model values for are
currently lower than the sensitivities of some ongoing experiments. On the other hand, upcoming experiments like nEXO [33] and
GERDA Phase II [34] are expected to be able to test our predicted values ofmββ.
4.2. Solution to the DW problem
As mentioned earlier, DWs are topological defects with surface-like characteristics that arise during the early stages of the Universe
when a discrete symmetry undergoes spontaneous breaking [4, 5]. In this work, we focused on two A4breaking patterns resulting
in the formation of DWs in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors. Typically, the presence of DWs becomes problematic when the
scale of the SSB is lower than the inflationary scale ∼(1014−1016)GeV [35–38]. Let us start by estimating the scale of symmetry
breaking that takes place in the charged lepton sector, precisely in the framework of A4→ZT
3. Recall that this breaking pattern
occurs when the flavon triplet Φattains a VEV along the direction ⟨Φ⟩=υΦ(1, 0, 0 )T, where the broken part is given by the
Klein four group K4. Consequently, there exist four degenerate vacua {ϕ1,ϕ2,ϕ3,ϕ4}associated with this breaking pattern; see
Eq. 15. Furthermore, this breaking pattern yielded the charged lepton masses in Eq. 4. By examining, for instance, the expression
of the tau lepton mass ( mτ=yτυdυΦ/Λ), we can derive an approximation for the ratio υΦ/Λ. Employing the value of the tau
lepton mass from the PDG, given as mτ=1776.85 MeV [28], and under the reasonable assumption that yτυd≲246GeV , we
establish a lower limit for this ratio, which is expressed as υΦ/Λ>0.007. Assuming that Λis approximately the SUSY-GUT scale
7Andromeda Proceedings BSM 2023, Hurghada, Egypt
MGUT∼2×1016GeV , we obtain a lower bound for the flavon VEV given as Φ>1.4×1014GeV . Consequently, in the charged
lepton sector, the discrete A4symmetry breaks down during the inflationary scale. In this case, any produced DWs are inflated
away, leaving only the ZT
3invariant ground state ϕ1=⟨Φ⟩.
Next, we analyze the DWs in the neutrino sector and estimate the scale of the symmetry breaking pattern A4→ZS
2in which
the broken part is given by ZTST2
2⋊ZT
3. The Majorana mass terms in the superpotential 1 are at the renormalizable level. We expect
a hierarchy among the VEVs of the NMSSM singlet and the flavon superfields with υS<υχ≲υΩ. This hierarchy makes sense
because υSis known to acquire a VEV around the scale of MSUSY . Additionally, it plays a role in introducing a slight deviation from
the TBM scheme, implying that its VEV should be smaller than those of the flavon fields. Consequently, the VEVs of flavons χand
Ωcan be reasonably placed in a range above MSUSY , say a range from 107to 1010GeV . This range ensures that the right-handed
neutrino masses ( Mi) in Eq. 6 align with the type I seesaw mechanism. Achieving this involves selecting the appropriate values for
the free parameters Y0,λχ,λΩ, and βinυu=υsinβwith υ=246GeV . As a result, these VEVs are smaller than the inflationary
scale, leading to the inevitable creation of stable DWs in the neutrino sector. These walls are inconsistent with standard cosmology
and must be avoided [39]. This is known as the DW problem.
To address this issue, we follow the well-known solution suggested by Zel’dovich et al. [4], which relies on making the walls un-
stable by assuming that the concerned discrete symmetry is only approximate. Specifically, introducing terms that break explicitly
the discrete symmetry will create a small energy difference between the vacua. This can be achieved by introducing higher dimen-
sional operators1
Mn
PlOn+3suppressed by powers of the Planck scale MPlleading to favor one of the vacua over the others, and
consequently the false vacua disappear before the walls take over as the main energy source in the Universe, see Refs. [9, 40, 41]
for more details and Ref. [42] for the case of NMSSM with Z3discrete symmetry.
In our case, the leading order operators that break explicitly the ZTST2
2⋊ZT
3⊂A4are of order five. Many operators fall into this
category, and all the possible terms can be chosen as given by a perturbation δWscalapplied to the trilinear couplings that are
present in the A4⋊Z3invariant superpotential4of the model given by
Wscal=µ2Φ2+λ1SHuHd+λ2S3+λ3Ω3+λ4Φ3+λ5χ3+λ6SΩ2+λ7χΩ2. (24)
The most appropriate five dimensional operator that can break the full discrete symmetry group A4×Z3is expressed as
WNR=λ′

Pl(Ω5)|(1,ω) (25)
which transforms as a nontrivial A4singlet. Since Ωtransforms as ∼1Q2under the extra Z3symmetry, this operator also induces
the breaking of the latter5. At the quantum level, the operator in Eq. 25 is represented by the Feynman diagram in Fig. 4. Thus, By

using the Feynman rules of supergraphs [43–45], we obtain the following contribution to the effective scalar potential6
Tthe operator described by Eq. 25 can be represented by the Feynman diagram illustrated in Fig. 4. Employing the Feynman
rules of supergraphs [43–45], we derive the corresponding contribution to the effective scalar potential7

flavon superfield Ω. Accordingly, the higher dimensional operator in Eq. 25 induces a linear term in the soft SUSY scalar potential
expressed as Vso f t⊃ηM3
WϕΩ+h.c. Due to the nontrivial transformation of the triplet ϕΩunder the A4×Z3flavor symmetry,
the term in Vso f tbreaks explicitly the symmetry into the Z2group. This contribution induces an energy difference among the six
degenerate vacua in Eq. 18. The energetically dominant true vacuum, say ϕ′
1, becomes the domainat state causing the remaining
false vacua to disappear before the walls dominate the energy density of the Universe.
4It is crucial to emphasize that this scalar superpotential is restricted to the Higgs doublets Hu,d, the gauge singlet S, and the flavons χ,Ω, andΦ.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
In this work, we have studied two primary aspects of SSB of non-Abelian discrete symmetries. In the first part, we investigate
neutrino phenomenology within a flavored NMSSM based on the flavor symmetry A4×Z3. This involves extending the usual
NMSSM by incorporating three right-handed neutrino and two flavon superfields. Each superfield is assigned representations
under the A4×Z3group to engineer appropriate neutrino masses and mixing. Notably, we achieve this in a minimal manner in
the sense that we employ only two flavon fields and the NMSSM singlet Sresponsible for the deviation from the well-known
TBM pattern. Then, we delved into the phenomenological implications of the neutrino sector, particularly in the NH scheme. By
using the 3 σallowed ranges of the oscillation parameters, we showed through scatter plots the permissible ranges for various
observables, such as ∑imi,mββ, and mβ. In the second part, our investigation focused on the breaking patterns of the A4flavor
group and the formation of DWs as a result of its SSB. We showed for the breaking patterns A4→Z3(charged lepton sector) and
A4→Z3(neutrino sector) the explicit expressions of the degenerate vacua. Then, after representing these vacua as vertices in flavon
space, we depicted the DW networks by connecting them. The resultant configuration gives rise to Platonic solids, where vertices
representing degenerate vacua are linked by edges symbolizing DWs. By analyzing the breaking scale of the flavor symmetry,
we found that the DWs formed in the neutrino sector conflict with cosmological observations. To address this issue, we used the
well-known solution of breaking the flavor symmetry explicitly employing higher dimensional Planck suppressed operators.

Appendix A. THE A4GROUP
In this appendix, we present some pertinent properties associated with the A4flavor group, which prove to be indispensable in
the study of fermion masses and mixing as well as the formation of the DWs. The non-Abelian group A4is generated by two
noncommuting generators Sand Tsatisfying S2=T3= (ST)3=I. In the Altarelli-Feruglio basis where the generator Tis
diagonal, the three-dimensional representation matrices of Sand Tare given by [46]
T=
1 0 0

0 0 ω
,S=
−1 2 2
2−1 2
2 2 −1
, (A.1)
where ω=e2πi/3. The group A4has four irreducible representations: one triplet 3(−1,0)and three different singlets 1(1,1),1(1,ω)
and1(1,ω2). The indices in these representations correspond to the characters of the generators of A4where the first entry repre-
sents the characters of Sgenerator, while the second entry represents the characters of the Tgenerator. For the one-dimensional
representations, these generators are expressed as
1(1,1):S=1, T=1;1(1,ω):S=1, T=ω2;1(1,ω2):S=1, T=ω. (A.2)
The order of the A4group is 12 and it possesses four distinct conjugacy classes given by
C1={e},C2={S,TST−1,T−1ST},C3={T,TS,ST,STS},C4={T2,ST2,T2S,ST2S}, (A.3)
thereby providing the representation of the 12 elements within A4. Besides the elements of A4, a crucial aspect for investigating
the formation of DWs is identifying all the subgroups within the A4symmetry. In addition to the trivial subgroup, the identity I,
and the whole group itself, A4has three cyclic Z2subgroups, four cyclic Z3subgroups and one Klein-four group K4. In terms of
the elements of A4, these subgroups are given by

Let us now outline the rules governing the tensor product of irreducible representations within the A4group. These represen-
tations are denoted by their basis characters and given as follows
1(1,ωi)×1(1,ωj)=1(1,ωi+j),3(−1,0)×1(1,ωi)=3(−1,0),3(−1,0)×3(−1,0)=1(1,1)+1(1,ω)+1(1,ω2)+3S
