We study numerically nonlinear dynamics of several types of molecular systems composed of
hydrogen-bonded chains placed inside carbon nanotubes wit h open edges. We demonstrate that
carbon nanotubes provide a stabilization mechanism for qua si-one-dimensional molecular chains via
the formation of their secondary structures. In particular , a polypeptide chain (Gly) Nplaced inside
a carbon nanotube can form of a stable helical chain (3 10,α,πandβ-helix) with parallel chains of
hydrogen-bondedpeptide groups. Achain of hydrogenﬂuorid e molecules can form hydrogen-bonded
zigzag chain. We reveal that in such geometries the hydrogen -bonded chains may remain stable
even atT= 500 K. Thus, our results suggest that the use of carbon nanot ubes with encapsulated
hydrogen ﬂuoride molecules may support high proton conduct ivity operating at high temperatures.
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the research activities of David Campbell has
been devoted to the study of nonlinear waves and soli-
tons in discrete systems [ 1,2], including the pioneering
results on nonlinear dynamics of polyacetylene [( CH)x]
[3]. Many of the discrete nonlinear models are inspired
by the physics of molecular systems. Realistic molecular
systems have a complex multi-component structure, con-
sisting of nonlinearly interacting subsystems (electronic,
excitonic, phononic, ionic, proton). In such systems, sta-
ble propagation of nonlinear waves (such as polarons,
solitons, kinks, etc.) can be observed when nonlinear
eﬀects compensate for linear dispersion. As a special ex-
ample, highly eﬃcient energy and charge transfer takes
place in molecular chains with hydrogen bonds.
Molecular systems with hydrogen bonds are charac-
terised by a relatively low stabilisation energy (0.12
- 0.40 eV per hydrogen bond), which ensures their
high dynamic mobility. Such structures include α-
helices and β-sheets of proteins [ 4,5], DNA double
helices, organic crystals of acetamides (e.g, acetanilide
(CH3CONHC 6H5)x[6,7]), crystals of aramides (Kevlar
crystals [ 8]), proton transport channels in cell mem-
branes [9–12], crystals of alcohols, hydrogen halides [ 13,
14], and some other systems.
However, many of the molecular systems studied the-
oretically are restricted by the assumption of low di-
mensionality, so they become unstable being place into
three-dimensionalspace. Also, molecularcomplexes with
hydrogen-bonded chains become unstable at high tem-
peratures (at T >100◦C all hydrogen bonds are de-
stroyed). In this paper, we study numerically the dy-
namics of quasi one-dimensional molecular systems with
hydrogen-bonded chains that can be stabilized being
placed inside open carbon nanotubes. In particular, we
∗asavin@chph.ras.ru
†yuri.kivshar@anu.edu.audemonstrate that a polypeptide chain (Gly) Nmay take
the form of a stable helical chain (3 10,α,πandβ-helix)
with parallel chains of hydrogen-bonded peptide groups.
A chain of hydrogen ﬂuoride molecules placed inside
a nanotube of small radius can form hydrogen-bonded
zigzag chain ···FH···FH···FH supporting proton trans-
port. In such molecular systems, the hydrogen-bonded
chains retain their structure and the interaction with the
nanotube lead to their additional stabilization. For some
molecular structures the hydrogen-bonded chains will re-
main stable even at T= 500 K.
II. NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF MOLECULAR
HYDROGEN-BONDED CHAINS
The presence of hydrogen-bonded chains of hydroxyl
groups in the molecular system
···O−H···O−H···O−H···O−H···O−H (1)
ensures its high proton conductivity in the direction of
these chains [ 15]. Proton transport across cell mem-
branes takes place through protein proton channels and
passes through hydrogen bond chains ( 1) formed by
amino acid residues containing the OH hydroxyl group
(serine, threonine, tyrosine) [ 9]. In the bacteriorhodopsin
molecule, the hydrogen bond chain is formed by tyrosine
residues contained in the seven transmembrane α-helical
segments of the molecule [ 16]. Hydrogen-bonding chains
(1) act as proton ”wire” and provide an eﬃcient pathway
for rapid proton transfer [ 17].
The idea of proton transport through the hydro-
gen bond chains of water molecules was proposed by
Theodore von Grotthuss in 1804[ 18]. According to mod-
ern ideas, proton transport in water and ice takes place
along the hydrogen bonding lattice and is divided into
two phases: the passage of the ionic defect (H+) (pro-
ton transport between water molecules involving the ex-
change of a covalent bond between O and H with a hy-
drogen bond) and the passage of the orientational defect2

(Bjerrum defect), which returns the hydrogen bonding
chain to its initial state [ 19]. Proton transport along the
zigzag chain of hydrogen bonds occurs in the form of
migration of two types of defects: ionic and orientational
[10,20]. Defect migration can be described as the motion
of topological solitons [ 21–25]. The creation and devel-
opment of the theory of proton soliton transport in the
literature is shown schematically in Fig. 1.
Based on the helical structure of protein [ 4,5] and
the theory of wave excitations (excitons) of molecular
crystals [ 26–29] A.S. Davydov and N.I. Kislukha in 1973
[30] (see also [ 31–33]), proposed the theory of soliton en-
ergytransportalongthe alpha-helixofproteinmolecules.
The alpha-helix of a protein is stabilised by three parallel
chainsofhydrogen-bondedHNCOpeptide groups(PGs):
H−N−N−C=O···H−N−N−C=O···H−N−N−C=O···,
(2)
where the lines represent valence bonds and the dots rep-
resent hydrogen bonds. According to Davydov’s theory,
these chains can transport energy released during the hy-
drolysis of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecule in
the form of self-localised states of vibrations of amide-I
double valence bonds C=O, which are part of PG. The
self-localisation of the amid-I vibration is caused by its
non-linear interaction with longitudinal deformations of
the hydrogen bond chains ( 2). Using this model, it was
shown that in α-helical protein molecules nonlinear col-
lective self-localised excitations can propagate without
energy loss and shape change, which were later called
Davydov solitons [34–38].
In the ﬁrst papers by Davydov et al. the continuum
approximation was used and the α-helix was treated as
a continuous medium. The discrete model was used tonumerically model the dynamics of Davydov solitons in
the work of Scott et al.[34,35]. These works have led to
an increased interest in the Davydov model [ 39–45]. The
Davydov model is still actively used today, see Refs. [ 46–
50].
The presence of hydrogen bonding chains ( 2) also al-
lows for the possibility of external electron transfer in α-
helical proteins in the form of an electrosoliton (a bound
state of a localised electron with the region of helix de-
formation resulting from the interaction of the electron
with the PG chains) [ 51–53].
Practically all molecular complexes with hydrogen
bonding chains are no longer stable at high tempera-
tures (at T >100◦C all hydrogen bonding chains are
destroyed). This complicates the use of such molecular
systems in nanotechnology. In this work it will be shown
that the use of complexes of such molecular systems with
carbon nanotubes can signiﬁcantly increase the stability
ofthehydrogenbond chains. Forthis purpose, quasione-
dimensionalmolecularsystems( α-helix ofprotein, zigzag
chain of hydrogen ﬂuoride molecules) will be placed in
carbon nanotubes of a certain radius. In this case, the
hydrogen bonding chains will retain their structure and
the interaction with the nanotube will lead to their ad-
ditional stabilisation, which will allow them to be used
for energy and charge transfer over a wider temperature
range. In such composite systems the hydrogen bonding
chains will remain stable even at T= 500 K.3

III. HELICES OF PROTEINS
To analyse helical structures, consider a polypeptide
chain (Gly) Nconsisting of Npeptide groups. The chem-
ical formula of such a chain is
CαH3−HNCO−(CαH2−HNCO−)N−2CαH2−H2NCO,
(3)
wheretwo hydrogenatomsareattachedto each α-carbon
atom (in order not to leave free valences, three hydrogen
atoms are attached to the ﬁrst α-carbon atom and one
hydrogen atom is attached to the nitrogen atom of the
last peptide group).
When modelling a polyglycine chain ( 3), it is conve-
nient to consider α-carbon atoms with attached hydro-
gen atoms as one united atom Cα. In this case each
chain link will consist of 5 atoms C α, C, O, N, H with
coordinates {un,i}5
i=1, wherenis the link number of the
polypeptide chain and iis the atom number. The atomic
masses are Mn,1= 14mp,Mn,2= 12mp,Mn,3= 16mp,
Mn,4= 14mp,Mn,5=mp(for end links M1,1= 15mp,
MN,4= 15mp), where mp= 1.6603×10−27kg – the
mass of a proton. To describe the interatomic interac-
tion, we will use the AMBER general force ﬁeld for or-
ganic molecules (version 2.1, April 2016) [ 54].

where the ﬁrst sum deﬁnes the kinetic energy (the three-

ordinates of the i-th atom of the n-th chain link), and

using the AMBER force ﬁeld.

The numerical solution of the problem ( 5) showed that
the polypeptide chain ( 3) has four stationary states as
a helix chain: 3 10-helix,α-helix,π-helix and β-helix –
see Fig. 2. Let us assume that the peptide groups n
andk(n < k) form a hydrogen bond if the non-valent
interaction energy of the corresponding chain links is

Each helix is characterised by the steady state energy E,
the number of hydrogen bond chains Nsp, the number of

and the length of the helix (the distance between the end

The chain of N= 73 peptide groups was used to anal-
yse the helical structures. The values of E,Nsp,Nhb,4
Ehb, andLfordiﬀerentstationarystates(conformations)
of the polypeptide chain (Cly) 73are given in Table I.
As can be seen from the table, the most energetically
unfavourable structure is the 3 10helix. Such a helix is
highly stretched, it has two chains of weakened hydrogen
bonds – see Fig. 2. Further more favourable in energy
are theα,π,βhelix and globule structures.
Let us consider the dynamics of helical structures. To
do this, we place the polypeptide chain in a Langevin
thermostat of temperature Tand simulate the dynamics
of the system numerically during the time t= 100 ns. To
do this, we numerically integrate the system of Langevin
equations

using the velocity Verlet method [ 55]. A time step of 1 fs
is used in the simulations, since further reduction of the
time step has no appreciable eﬀect on the results.
Let us numerically integrate the system of equations
of motion ( 6) with the initial condition corresponding
to the stationary state of the polypeptide chain. After
the dynamics of the molecular system reaches the steady
state, we will ﬁnd the time averagesof the system energy
¯E(T), the number of hydrogen bonds ¯Nhb(T) and chain
length¯L(T).

ized by its dimensionless heat capacity

The 3 10-helix is the most unstable. At temperature
T= 10 K it changes to π-helix. The alpha helix of the
chain remains stable at T < T 1= 95 K, at T1< T <
T2= 235 K the α-helix changes into π-helix, and at T2<
T < T 3= 285 K into β-helix. At T≥T3, the chain
transforms into a globule shape – see Fig. 3. Theπ-helix
remains stable at T < T 2, atT=T2it changes into a
β-helix. The beta helix is stableat T < T 3, atT > T 3the100 200 300 4000.40.60.81nhb (a)

chain adopts the globule form. The transitions between
the forms of the helix occur without changing the heat
capacity of the molecular system, i.e. these are second
order phase transitions. The increase in heat capacity
occurs only when the chain transitions to the globular
form. The temperature T=T3can be considered as
the melting point of the β-helix. The transition of a
helix into a globule is ﬁrst order phase transition, here
the dimensionless heat capacity increases from c= 1 to
c= 1.2.
Thus, in an isolated polyglycine peptide chain, regu-
lar chains of hydrogen bonds ( 2) can only exist at low
temperatures T <285 K.
IV. CONFORMATIONS OF A PEPTIDE CHAIN
INSIDE A CARBON NANOTUBE
Polypeptide molecules tend to self-insertion into car-
bon nanotubes with open ends. Inside the nanotube,
polypeptide atoms are able to fully realise non-valent in-
teractions with its surface [ 56–58]. This is particularly
signiﬁcant for hydrophobic polypeptides such as (Gly) N,
(Ala)N, (Val) N, (Ile)N. Letusdeterminewhatconforma-
tions the polypeptide chain (Gly) Ninside a single-walled
carbon nanotube with chirality index ( n,m) (CNT (n,m))5
can take.
To describe dynamics of CNT we presentthe nanotube
Hamiltonian in the form

n=1/bracketleftbigg1
2Mn,0(˙vn,˙vn)+Qn/bracketrightbigg
, (8)
whereNcis the number of atoms in the CNT, Mn,0is
the mass of n-th carbon atom, vn={vn,i(t)}3
i=1is the
radius vector of n-th atom at the time t. The term Qn
describes the interaction energy of the atom with index
nwith neighboring atoms.
To describe the carbon-carbon valence interactions,
let us use a standard set molecular dynamics potentials
[59,60]. We consider a hydrogen-terminated nanotube
with open ends, where edge atoms correspond to the
molecular group CH. We will consider such a group as
a single eﬀective particle at the location of the carbon
atom. Therefore, in our model of open CNT we take the
mass of atoms inside the nanotube as Mn,0= 12mp, and
for the edge atoms as Mn,0= 13mp.
The valence bond between two neighboring carbon
atomsnandkcan be described by the Morse potential
U1(vn,vk) =ǫ1{exp[−α(rnk−r1)]−1}2,(9)
wherernk=|vn−vk|,ǫ1= 4.9632eVisthe valencebond
energy, and r1= 1.418˚A is the equilibrium valence bond
length.
The valence angle deformation energy between three
adjacent carbon atoms n,k, andlcan be described by
the potential
U2(vn,vk,vl) =ǫ2(cosϕ−cosϕ0)2,(10)
wherecos ϕ= (vn−vk,vl−vk)/rnkrkl, andϕ0= 2π/3is
theequilibriumvalentangle. Parameters α= 1.7889˚A−1
andǫ2= 1.3143 eV can be found from the small-
amplitude oscillations spectrum of the graphene sheet
[61]. Valence bonds between four adjacent carbon atoms
n,m,k, andlconstitute torsion angles, whose potential
energy can be deﬁned as
U3(φ) =ǫ3(1−cosφ), (11)
whereφis the corresponding torsion angle ( φ= 0 is the
equilibrium value of the angle) and ǫ3= 0.499 eV. A
detailed discussion about the choice of the interatomic
potential parameters can be found in [ 59].

with parameters from the AMBER force ﬁeld.

diusR >5.1˚A,π-helix – in nanotubes with R >5.9˚A,
β-helix – in nanotubes with R >6.1˚A. Note that in nan-
otubes with R <5˚A , hydrogenbonds become strong for

tide chain and the nanotube occurs here (the smaller the
radius of the nanotube, the greater the interaction en-
ergy).

Numerical integration of the system of equations of
motion (14), (15) showed that at T <500 K there is only
one basic helix type for each nanotube. For CNT (13,0)
the 310helix will be the basic helix. Here, at T <75 K,
two forms of helix can exist: 3 10andαhelix, and at
T >75 K, only the 3 10helix can exist (thermal ﬂuctua-
tions lead to the transition of the αhelix to the 3 10helix)
– see Fig. 4and Fig. 5. The 3 10helix exists at all tem-
peratures T <500 K. As the temperature increases, only
partialbreakingof the edge hydrogenbonds occurs, lead-
ing to a decrease in nhband an increase in the peptide
chain length ¯L. The dimensionless heat capacity of the
(Gly)73∈CNT(13,0)complex remains constant at c= 1.
Note that for an isolated peptide chain, the 3 10helix
form is the most unstable. Even at T= 10 K, thermal
ﬂuctuations lead to a rapid transition to the π-helix, and
atT= 285 K the chain melts (the chain changes from
helical to molten globule form).

states of the peptide chain in nanotubes with chirality
indices (8,8), (9,9) and (10,10) is shown in Fig. 7. All
these helixes are stable to thermal ﬂuctuations at T <
500 K. With increasing temperature there is only a small
decreaseinthenumberofhydrogenbonds–seeFig. 6(a).
At the sametime, the dimensionless heatcapacityalways
remains equal to one and the length of the helix is almost
unchanged – see Fig. 6(b) and (c).
Thus, placing a polypeptide chain in a nanotube of
small radius will stabilise its helical shape. For the sim-
plest polypeptide chain (Gly) N, the most stable to ther-
mal ﬂuctuations will be the α-helix lying inside the nan-
otube (9,9). Here the α-helix is conservedat all tempera-
turesT <500 K. Note that such stabilisation of the heli-
cal shape is impossible for an isolated polypeptide chain.
Note that the optimal nanotube radius for helix stabil-
isation depends on the size of the amino acid residues.
For larger Ala, Val, Ile residues, the best stabilisation
will occur in nanotubes of larger radius.100 200 300 4000.80.91nhb(a) 1

V. HYDROGEN-BONDED CHAINS OF
HYDROGEN FLUORIDE MOLECULES
Experimental and theoretical studies of water-ﬁlled
carbon nanotubes have shown that water molecules can
enter the interior of the open nanotubes and form ex-
tended hydrogen bond chains [ 62–66]. Small-diameter
nanotubes with a chain of water molecules inside can act
as proton-conducting channels [ 67,68].
Carbon nanotubes are hydrophobic and the pres-
ence of water molecules inside them is not energetically
favourable. Inside the nanotube, water molecules cannot
organise a three-dimensional lattice of hydrogen bonds.
For example, inside a CNT (6,6)(diameter D= 0.80 nm)
only one chain of water molecules can be found, in which
each molecule participates in the formation of two hydro-
gen bonds (in the bulk phase each molecule participates
in the formation of four bonds) [ 69].
Hydrogen ﬂuoride molecules FH can also form zigzag
chains of hydrogen bonds (FH) ∞:
···F−H···F−H···F−H···F−H···F−H,(17)
which are similar to zigzag chains of hydroxyl groups ( 1).
At temperature T <189.6 K, hydrogen ﬂuoride has a
crystal structure formed by parallel ﬂat hydrogen bond8

8.8) and (c) nanotube (10,10) ( Lcnt= 7.3). The temperature
isT= 300K. In nanotube (8,8) the chain is in the form of
aα-helix, in nanotube (9,9) in the form of a π-helix, and in
(10,10) inthe form of a β-helix. For convenience, some carbon

chains[70]. Notethataseparatezigzagchainofhydrogen
bonds (17) becomes unstable in three-dimensional space.
The chain breaks down into cyclic chains of small size,
the most stable being chains of 6 molecules in the shape
of a regular hexagon [ 71]. Hydrogen bond chains ( 17)
can be stabilised by placing them inside the CNT, i.e.
forming a (FH) ∞∈CNT structure.
In each chain( 17), onehydrogenﬂuoride molecule par-
ticipates in the formation of two hydrogen bonds. Anal-
ysis of the interaction of the F–H ···F–H dimer with the
CNT shows that it is energetically more favourable for
the hydrogen ﬂuoride dimer to be inside the nanotube
than outside [ 72]. Therefore, (FH) Nchains can easily
be placed inside open CNTs to form stable (FH) N∈CNT
structures ( N– number of hydrogen ﬂuoride molecules).
Keeping hydrogen ﬂuoride inside nanotubes may help to
avoid problems associated with its high toxicity [ 73].

The relative simplicity and a suﬃciently large number
of free parameters of the 12-6-1 potential make it very
convenientformodellingthedynamicsofmulti-molecular
complexes of two-atom FH molecules. The FH molecule
usually participates in the formation of two strong hy-
drogen bonds, polarising signiﬁcantly in the process. We
will assume that when the valence bond length r=|FH|
changes, the charge arrangement distances from the cen-
tre of the ﬂuorine atom also change proportionally. To
model the dynamics of the hydrogen bond chain ( 17) it
is best to use the potential ( 19) with the parameters

molecules inside nanotubes with chirality indices (6,6)
and (10,0). We will therefore consider these complexes
further.
To avoid the possibility of hydrogen ﬂuoride molecules
escaping from the nanotubes, it is better to narrow their
open edges as shown in Fig. 9. The small diameter
of the edge openings ( D= 0.47 and 0.42 nm) will pre-
vent a large ﬂuorine atom from leaving, but will preserve
the possibility of protons leaving and entering. So we
get a chain of hydrogen bonds encapsulated in a carbon
nanotube: (FH) N@CNT. Note that in 2016 endohedral
fullerene HF@C60 was synthesised containing Buckmin-
sterfullerene inside a molecule of hydrogen ﬂuoride [ 77].
Proton transport along the zigzag chain of hydro-
gen bonds proceeds by migration of two types of de-
fects: ionic and orientational [ 10,20]. In the ﬁrst
stage of transport, the proton moves as an ionic
defect. There is a sequential movement of hydro-
gen atoms along the hydrogen bond lines from one
ﬂuorine atom to the neighbouring one, transferring
the chain from the ···FH···FH···FH···FH···to the
···HF···HF···HF···HF···. In the second stage, an ori-
entation defect (sequential rotation of the FH chain
molecules by the zigzag angle α) must pass through the
chain to bring the chain back to its original orientation.
Notethattheusedforceﬁeld( 18), (19)allowstomodel
the formation and motion of orientational defects.
The chain of hydrogen bonds inside the nanotube is
bistable, all molecules of the chain can be orientated ei-
ther from left to right or from right to left. An orien-
tation defect occurs when the molecules of the chain are
directed in diﬀerent directions in the ﬁrst and second
parts of the chain. When the molecules face each other,
an excess density of protons appears in the defect locali-
sation region, so such a defect is called a positive defect –
see Fig.9(b) and (e). When the molecules are directed
away from each other in the defect localisation region,
the proton density decreases, so such a defect is called
negative – see Fig. 9(c) and (f).
The stationary orientational defects of the hydrogen
bonding chain (FH) Ninside CNT (6,6) and (10,0) are
shown in Fig. 9(b, c, e, f). As can be seen from the
ﬁgure, the orientational defects are localised at 3-4 chain10

links. In nanotube (6,6), the energy of positive defect
(the diﬀerence ofthe energyofthe chainwith defect from
the energy of the ground state of the chain) is ∆ E+=
0.56 eV, the energy of negative defect is ∆ E−= 0.51 eV.
In the (10,0) nanotube, the orientational defect energies
of the chain ∆ E+= 0.06 eV, ∆ E−= 0.91 eV.
To test the stability of a chain of hydrogen bonds
(FH)Nplaced inside a CNT, a molecular dynamics sim-
ulation was carried out on a chain of N= 177 FH
molecules placed inside a CNT (6,6)with narrowed open
edges. With a length of L= 38.7 nm, such a nanotube is
presented by the formula C 3620H20. A zigzagchain of hy-
drogen bonds (FH) 177completely ﬁlls the internal cavity
of the nanotube. Such a nanotube of length L= 8.7 nm
is shown in Fig. 9(d).
Numerical modeling of the system of equations of mo-
tion (14), (15) showed that the chain of hydrogen bondsinside the nanotube, complex (FH) 177@CNT (6,6), at all
considered temperatures T <500 K remains stable – it
always remains inside and maintains a zigzag shape. At
T <400 K, the chain of hydrogen bonds always remains
in the initial ground state, and at T >400 K a positive
orientational defect [ 78] can already appear at the right
end of the chain and then move along it.
Simulation of the dynamics of a complex with an ori-
entational defect in the internal chain of hydrogen bonds
showed that the movement of the defects is thermally ac-
tivated (at low temperatures the defects remain pinned)
and occurs in the form of Brownian motion of the par-
ticle along the chain. The higher the temperature, the
higher the mobility of defects. A positive orientation de-
fect has higher mobility than a negative defect. A defect
disappears when it reaches the end of the chain and the
chain goes into a homogeneous ground state.
Thus, thermal vibrations do not lead to breaks in
the chain of hydrogen bonds (FH) ∞inside the carbon
nanotube, so the chain can always be used for pro-
ton transport. When a proton is transferred along a
chain of hydrogen bonds, the longest time is required for
its reorientation after passing through the ionic defect.
This reorientation, the transition of the chain from the
HF···HF···HF···state to the FH ···FH···FH···state,
occursduetothermallyactivatedpassagealongthechain
of positive orientation defect. Therefore, thermal vibra-
tions not only do not interfere with the transport of pro-
tons along the chain of hydrogen bonds inside the nan-
otube, but they are its necessary condition.
VI. CONCLUSION
Being inspired by the pioneering studies of David
Campbell on nonlineardynamicsin molecularstructures,
here we have studied numerically the structure and dy-
namics of several types of hydrogen-bonded molecular
chains placed inside caped or open carbon nanotubes.
We have demonstrated that a polypeptide chain is sta-
bilized by a carbon nanotube, and it may take the form
of a helical structure with parallel chains of hydrogen-
bonded peptide groups. A chain of hydrogen ﬂuoride
molecules placed inside a nanotube of small radius can
form hydrogen-bondedzigzag chain being highly suitable
for the proton transport. In such molecular systems,
the hydrogen-bonded chains retain their structure, be-
ing stabilized by the interaction with the nanotube. For
some molecular structures the hydrogen-bonded chains
will remain stable even at T= 500 K. Thus, the re-
sults of our numerical modeling suggest that the use of
carbon nanotubes with encapsulated hydrogen ﬂuoride
molecules would allow to construct anhydrous molecular
systems supporting high proton conductivity being capa-
ble of operating at high temperatures.11
