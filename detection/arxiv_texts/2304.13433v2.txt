arXiv:2304.13433v2  [math.AP]  3 May 2023FAST DIFFUSION EQUATION: UNIQUENESS OF SOLUTIONS WITH
A MOVING SINGULARITY
MAREK FILA †AND PETRA MACKOV ´A
Abstract. We focus on open questions regarding the uniqueness of distributio nal so-
lutions of the fast diﬀusion equation (FDE) with a given source term. When the source
is suﬃciently smooth, the uniqueness follows from standard results . Assuming that the
source term is a measure, the existence of diﬀerent classes of solu tions is known, but in
many cases, their uniqueness is an open problem. In our work, we fo cus on the supercrit-
ical FDE and prove the uniqueness of distributional solutions with a D irac source term
that moves along a prescribed curve. Moreover, we extend a uniqu eness results for the
subcritical FDE from standing to moving singularities.
1.Introduction
Let 0< m <1,n≥3, and 0 < T≤ ∞. We study the uniqueness of distributional
solutions of the fast diﬀusion equation
(1) ut= ∆um+f(x,t),inD′(Rn×(0,T)),
wherefis a given source term. More speciﬁcally, we are interested in solution s of (1)
that satisfy u∈L1

Some techniques to prove uniqueness of solutions of (1) can be fou nd in the book [16]
by V´ azquez. Focusing on weak solutions and assuming that u∈L2
loc(Rn×(0,T)),um∈
L2
loc(0,T;H1
0(Rn)), andf∈L1
loc(Rn×(0,T)), one can use a test function ϕof the form
ϕ(x,t) =

/integraltextT
t/parenleftbig
um
1(x,s)−um
2(x,s)/parenrightbig
dsif 0< t < T,
0 if t≥T,
which was introduced by Oleinik [12].
The critical exponent mc:= (n−2)/nplays an important role in the theory of the fast
diﬀusion equation. See, for example V´ azquez [17]. In [11], Lukkari studies solutions of
the fast diﬀusion equation in the range mc< m <1 with Ω instead of Rn, where Ω is a
bounded domain with a smooth boundary. Assuming that the forcing termfis a non-
negative Radon measure on Rn+1such that f(Ω×(0,T))<∞, he proves the existence of
a speciﬁc class of weak solutions of (1) in cylinders of the form Ω ×(0,T). These solutions
satisfyu∈Lq((0,T);W1,q
0(Ω)), where qis any number such that 1 ≤q <1+1/(1+mn).
Since the upper bound on qis always less than 2, Lukkari’s weak solutions lack the L2-
integrability conditions assumed by V´ azquez in [16], hence, their uniq ueness was left as
an open problem.
A standard uniqueness result for 0 < m < 1 by Herrero and Pierre can be found
in [8]. Here, the authors prove the uniqueness of distributional solu tions of the signed fast
diﬀusion equation, i.e.
(3) ut= ∆(u|u|m−1) in D′(Rn×(0,∞)),
assuming that u∈C([0,∞);L1
loc(Rn)) and the time derivative satisﬁes ut∈L1
loc(Rn×
(0,∞)).
More recently, new results concerning uniqueness of subcritical f ast diﬀusion have been
found. In[15], TakahashiandYamamotofocusedonthecasewhen n≥3and0< m < m c.
They showed the uniqueness of signed solutions of the initial value pr oblem
ut= ∆(u|u|m−1), x∈Rn\{ξ0}, t∈(0,T), (4)
u(x,0) =u0(x), x ∈Rn\{ξ0}, (5)
with 0< T≤ ∞andξ0∈Rn. More precisely, the authors of [15] proved that for two
functions u1,u2such that u1,u2∈C2,1((Rn\ {ξ0})×(0,T))∩C((Rn\ {ξ0})×[0,T))
that satisfy (4)-(5) pointwise and u1(·,0) =u2(·,0) onRn\{ξ0}, it holds that u1≡u2on
(Rn\{ξ0})×(0,T). Hui demonstrated in [9] that if n≥3 and 0< m < m c, under suitable
conditions on initial data, solutions that have a ﬁnite number of stan ding singularities
are also uniquely determined. By solutions with ﬁnitely many standing s ingularities, we
mean that these solutions satisfy equations (4)-(5) with Rn\ {ξ0,ξ1,...,ξ i}instead of
Rn\{ξ0}. Here,i∈Nandξ0,ξ1,...,ξ i∈Rn.FDE: UNIQUENESS OF SOLUTIONS WITH A MOVING SINGULARITY 3
More generally, we can assume that ξ: [0,T)→Rnis a given curve and study the
problem
ut= ∆(u|u|m−1), x∈Rn\{ξ(t)}, t∈(0,T), (6)
u(x,0) =u0(x), x ∈Rn\{ξ(0)}, (7)
with a moving singularity ξ(t)/\e}atio\slash≡ξ(0) for some t∈(0,T) and 0 < T≤ ∞. In the
casem > m candT=∞, positive asymptotically radially symmetric solutions of the
initial value problem (6)-(7) were studied in [4, 5, 6]. Along the given cu rveξwith
suitable properties, these solutions keep a singularity at all times, i.e .u(x,t)→ ∞as
x→ξ(t) for each t∈[0,T). Our main result concerns the uniqueness of these solutions
in the supercritical fast diﬀusion case. In order to formulate this r esult, we give a precise
description of solutions from [4, 6]. Let n≥3 andT=∞. Assume that either
(A0)m > m candξ(t)≡ξ0for some ξ0∈Rn,
or
(A1)m > m ∗:= (n−2)/(n−1) andξ∈C1([0,∞);Rn),ξ′is locally H¨ older continuous,
and there exist positive constants Ξ ,βsuch that |ξ′(t)| ≤Ξe−βtfort≥0.
Assume, moreover, that
(A2)k∈C1([0,∞)) satisﬁes κ−1≤k(t)≤κand|k′(t)| ≤κ′fort≥0 and some positive
constants κandκ′,
(A3)u0(x)∈C(Rn\{ξ(0)}) is positive and there exist λ,µandνsatisfying
(8) max {(n−2)/m−1,0}< λ < µ < n −2< ν
such that u0(x)m=k(t)m|x−ξ(0)|−n+2+O(|x−ξ(0)|−λ) asx→ξ(0), andC−1|x−
ξ(0)|−ν≤u0(x)m≤C|x−ξ(0)|−µfor|x−ξ(0)| ≥1 with some constant C >1.
Under these assumptions, [4] implies the existence of a function u >0 satisfying the
following:
(i)u∈C2,1({(x,t)∈Rn+1:x/\e}atio\slash=ξ(t), t∈(0,∞)})∩C({(x,t)∈Rn+1:x/\e}atio\slash=ξ(t), t∈
[0,∞)}) andusatisﬁes (6)-(7) pointwise,
(ii)u∈C([0,∞);L1
loc(Rn)),
(iii) for each t≥0,uhas the asymptotic behavior
u(x,t)m=k(t)m|x−ξ(t)|−n+2+O(|x−ξ(t)|−λ) as x→ξ(t),
(iv) fort≥0 and|x−ξ(t)| ≥1, it holds that
C−1e−Ct|x−ξ(t)|−ν≤u(x,t)m≤CeCt|x−ξ(t)|−µ
with some constant C >1.
We note that [4] dealt with moving singularities, i.e. the existence was p roved under
assumptions (A1), (A2), (A3). Later, in [6] it was remarked that t he existence from [4]4 M. FILA AND P. MACKOV ´A
is valid in the whole supercritical parameter range m > m cif the singularity is standing
(i.e. assuming (A0), (A2), (A3)).
Moreover, it was established in [6] that a function ufrom [4] satisfying (i)-(iii) is a
distributional solution of problem (1) with a weighted moving Dirac sou rce term
ut= ∆um+(n−2)|Sn−1|km(t)δξ(t)(x) in D′(Rn×(0,∞)).
More precisely, usatisﬁes (2) for all ϕ∈C∞
0(Rn×(0,∞)) with
f(x,t) = (n−2)|Sn−1|km(t)δξ(t)(x).
Here,δξ(t)gives unit mass to the point ξ(t)∈Rnfor each t≥0, and|Sn−1|denotes the
surface area ofthe( n−1)-dimensional unit sphere. ADiracmeasure thatmoves with time
can be also found as a source in parabolic systems, and this phenome non has been used
to model various biological scenarios, such as axon growth or angio genesis, as discussed
in [2] and [1], respectively. We summarize our main result in the theorem below.
Theorem 1.1.Letn≥3andT=∞. Assume that either (A 0)or (A1)holds.
Assume, moreover, that conditions (A 2), and (A3)are satisﬁed, and that functions u1,u2
satisfy(i)–(iii). Then the equality u1(·,0) =u2(·,0)onRn\{ξ(0)}implies that u1≡u2
on{(x,t)∈Rn+1:x/\e}atio\slash=ξ(t), t∈(0,∞)}.
In this paper, we show that with a modiﬁcation of the proof of Theor em 2.2 in [15],
the uniqueness result of Takahashi and Yamamoto can be extende d from solutions with
standing singularities to solutions with moving singularities. More prec isely, we will prove
the following.
Theorem 1.2.Letn≥3,0< m < m c,0< T≤ ∞, andξ∈C([0,T);Rn). If functions
u1,u2belong to the function space C2,1({(x,t)∈Rn+1:x/\e}atio\slash=ξ(t), t∈(0,T)})∩C({(x,t)∈
Rn+1:x/\e}atio\slash=ξ(t), t∈[0,T)}), they satisfy (6)-(7)pointwise, and u1(·,0) =u2(·,0)on
Rn\{ξ(0)}, thenu1≡u2on{(x,t)∈Rn+1:x/\e}atio\slash=ξ(t), t∈(0,T)}.
Moreover, given a particular condition on the initial function u0, an approach from [15]
leads to the following result.
Corollary 1.3.Letn≥3,0< m < m c,0< T≤ ∞, andξ∈C([0,T);Rn).
Assume that function usatisﬁes (6)-(7)pointwise, u∈C2,1({(x,t)∈Rn+1:x/\e}atio\slash=ξ(t), t∈
(0,T)})∩C({(x,t)∈Rn+1:x/\e}atio\slash=ξ(t), t∈[0,T)}), andu0∈L1
loc(Rn). Then u∈
L1
loc(Rn×(0,T)).
Remark 1.4.Solutions with standing singularities that satisfy the assumptions of
both Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.3 have been shown to exist, such as a class of solutions
with so-called anisotropic singularities from [6]. However, the existen ce of solutions with
moving singularities when n≥3 and 0< m < m cremains an open problem.FDE: UNIQUENESS OF SOLUTIONS WITH A MOVING SINGULARITY 5
Remark 1.5.It is worth noting that by applying arguments from [6], Theorem 1.2,
and Corollary 1.3, it can be shown that the function umentioned in Corollary 1.3 is a
distributional solution of equation (3), i.e.

Uniqueness results for the porous medium equation can be found in [ 3, 13, 16]. For
the uniqueness of solutions of a semi-linear parabolic equation with sin gularity moving
along a prescribed curve, see [14], where similar conditions to (i)-(iv ) were considered.
For non-uniqueness examples for a semilinear heat equation, see e.g . [7] and references
therein.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the proof of Th eorem 1.1. This
proof is based on ideas from [15], [6], and [8]. In Section 3, we present t he proof of
Theorem 1.2. Finally, Section 4 consists of the proof of Corollary 1.3.
2.Proof of Theorem 1.1
Proof. This proof is based on ideas of Takahashi, Yamamoto, F., M., Yanagida , Her-
rero, and Pierre, see [15], [6], and [8].
Step 1. Set sign( f) =f/|f|forf/\e}atio\slash= 0 and sign( f) = 0 for f= 0. We recall that
for a locally integrable function fsuch that ∆ f∈L1
loc(D) inD⊆Rn, Kato proved the
distributional inequality
(9) sign( f)∆f≤∆|f|.
Letu1,u2be two functions satisfying assumptions (i)-(iii) and u1(·,0) =u2(·,0) onRn\
{ξ(0)}. Then it holds that

3.Proof of Theorem 1.2
Proof. Step 1.With a few modiﬁcations, the ﬁrst step is almost the same as in the
proof of Theorem 1.1 in Section 2. First, we substitute |um
1−um
2|with|u1|u1|m−1−
u2|u2|m−1|. We will be also choosing a slightly diﬀerent test function. Let ηε,ϕbe as in
Section 2, i.e. let ϕ∈C∞
0(Rn) be a nonnegative function, and for ε >0 letηε∈C2(R)
be a non-negative cut-oﬀ function such that (10) and (11) hold fo r somec0>0. We
deﬁne ˜ηε:=ηk
εand ˜ϕ:=ϕkwherek >1/(1−m). Then we choose ˜ ϕε(x,t) :=ϕε(x,t)k=
ηε(|x−ξ(t)|)kϕ(x,t)kwithk >1/(1−m). With these two changes, the ﬁrst step is the
same as in Section 2 and we proceed directly to the second step.
Step 2. In order to pass to the limit as ε→0, we need to show that |u1−u2| ∈
L1
loc(Rn×(0,t)) fort >0 ﬁxed. This will be done in the same spirit as in the proof of
Theorem 2.2 in [15] by Takahashi and Yamamoto, who considered this problem with a
standing singularity. We use estimate (13) and show that C[˜ϕε]<∞. In what follows,
bycwe will denote a positive, large enough constant independent of εbut otherwise
arbitrary. By the deﬁnition of C[˜ϕε],ηε≤1,ϕ∈C∞
0(Rn),k >1/(1−m), (19), and
change of variables y=x/ε, we have

Lettingε→0, we see that by m < m c, the asserion (16) holds. This completes the second
step.
Step 3.Finally, in the last step, we proceed as in the proof of Theorem 1.1.

4.Proof of Corollary 1.3
Proof. Corollary 1.3 follows from estimates at the end of the ﬁrst step of pr oof of
Theorem 1.1 in Section 2. We can repeat these estimates with uminstead of |um
1−um
2|,u
instead of |u1−u2|, and ˜ϕεinstead of ϕε, where ˜ϕεis as in Section 3. Then we can write
equation (12) as f′(t)≤2C[˜ϕε]1−mfm(t) withf(0) =/integraltext
Rn˜ϕε(x,0)|u(x,0)|dx. Hence,
instead of (14), we now have

As was shown in (20), we can let ε→0 and obtain
