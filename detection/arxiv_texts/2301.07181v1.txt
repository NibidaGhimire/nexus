Abstract
The dichromatic number of a digraph Dis the minimum number of colors of a vertex
coloring of Dsuch that Dhas no monochromatic cycles. The Haj´ os join were recently
extended to digraphs (using the dichromatic number) by J. Ba ng-Jensen et. al. and Haj´ os
(directed) operations is a tool to obtain r-(di)chromatic ( di)graphs. J. Bang-Jensen et. al.
posed in 2020 the problem of how to obtain the symmetric cycle of length 5 from symmetric
cycles of length 3. We recently solved this problem by applyi ng a genetic algorithm. In this
article, a procedure is presented to construct any odd symme tric cycle by applying directed
Haj´ os operations to symmetric cycles of length 3, thus, gen eralizing the known construction
of the symmetric cycle of length 5. In addition, this procedu re is analyzed to determine its
computational complexity.
1 Introduction
The dichromatic number of a digraph Dwas introduced by V. Neumann-Lara in 1982 [20] as
an extension of the chromatic number of a graph. The dichromatic n umber of a digraph is the
minimum number of colors of a vertex coloring of Dsuch that Dhas no monochromatic cycles
and several concepts and results for the chromatic number of a g raph have been extended to
digraphs using the dichromatic number. For instance, [1,2,9,12,1 4,15]. In 2020 J. Bang-Jensen
et. al. [3] extended the well-known Haj´ os join for graphs to digrap hs.
The digraph Hobtained by identifying a non-empty set Iof independent vertices is deﬁned

and all arcs from N−

D(u) tov. The new vertex vmay preserve the label of one of
the vertices of the independent set I.
The Haj´ os join was deﬁned for digraphs in 2020 by Bang-Jensen et . al. [3] as an extension
of the well-known Haj´ os join [13,17,24] for graphs. We use Figure 1 to illustrate the deﬁnition
of directed Haj´ os Join. Let D1andD2be two disjoint digraphs. Let u1v1∈A(D1) andv2u2∈
A(D2). Thedirected Haj´ os join D= (D1,u1,v1)▽(D2,v2,u2) or, brieﬂy D=D1▽D2ofD1
andD2is deﬁned as the disjoint union of D1andD2and deleting both arcs u1v1andv2u2,
identifying the vertices v1andv2to a new vertex vand adding the arc u1u2. The vertex vmay
be denoted by v1,v2orv.

We call the directed Haj´ os join and the vertex identiﬁcations the directed Haj´ os opera-
tions. The class of Haj´ os-k-constructible digraphs deﬁned as the smallest family of digraphs
that contains all complete digraphs of order kand is closed under directed Haj´ os operations. J.
Bang-Jensen et. al. [3] proved that any k-critical digraph is Haj´ os- k-constructible. Since odd
symmetric cycles are 3-critical, any symmetric odd cycle can be cons tructed from the symmetric
complete digraph on three vertices D(K3) using a sequence of directed Haj´ os operations (di-
rected Haj´ os joins and identiﬁcations of non-adjacent vertices ). In the same paper they posed
the following question (Question 19):
How can a bidirected (symmetric) C5(D(C5)) be constructed from copies of D(K3)by only
using directed Haj´ os operations?
In a recent paper J. C. Garc´ ıa-Altamiranoet. al. [11] obtained a s equence of Haj´ os operations
applied to D(K3) in order to obtain the symmetric cycle D(C5) using a Rank Genetic Algorithm.
In this paper we generalize this sequence to obtain any odd symmetr ic cycle applying Haj´ os
operations from D(K3). This procedure provides an upper bound to the Haj´ os number o f any
odd symmetric cycle and an upper bound of its computational comple xity.
We consider ﬁnite digraphs without loops and multiple arcs. For all deﬁ nitions not given here
we refer the reader to the book of J. Bang-Jensen and G. Gutin [4 ]. LetDbe a digraph with
vertex set V(D) and arc set A(D). Thein-neighborhood of a vertex uisN−(u) ={v∈V(D)|
vu∈A(D)}and the out-neighborhood of a vertex uisN+(u) ={v∈V(D)|uv∈A(D)}.
Two vertices in a digraph Dareindependent if there are no arcs between them in D, a set
of vertices Xis independent in a digraph Dif any pair of vertices of Xare independent in D.
An arcuv∈A(D) issymmetric (asymmetric ) ifvu∈A(D) (vu /∈A(D)), and a digraph is
symmetric (bidirected graph) if every arc of Dis a symmetric arc. The symmetric digraph
D(G), of the graph G, is the digraph obtained by replacing each edge by a symmetric arc.
2 Construction of odd symmetric cycles
LetDandD′be two disjoint digraphs of the same order n, with vertex-set {v0,v1,...,vn−1}and
{v′
0,v′
1,...,v′
n−1}resp., and let vivj∈A(D) andv′
kv′
l∈A(D′), such that i,j,k,l∈ {0,1,...,n−1},
i/\e}atio\slash=j,k/\e}atio\slash=landj−i/\e}atio\slash=k−l. We deﬁne the cyclic of Haj´ os identiﬁcation H= (D,vi,vj)⊗
(D′,v′
k,v′
l) or, simply H=D⊗D′, as the digraph obtained by the directed Haj´ os Join ˆH:=
(D,vi,vj)▽(D′,v′
k,v′
l), and the following n−1 identiﬁcations: for r= 1,2,...,n−1, the vertices
v′
k+randvj+rare identiﬁed in the vertex vj+r, the indices are taken modulo n.A procedure to obtain symmetric cycles of any odd length using direc ted Haj´ os constructions 3
Remark 1. By deﬁnition, we identify the vertices v′
a,va−k+j∈V(ˆH)in the vertex va−k+j. The
condition j−i/\e}atio\slash=k−lassures that the vertices v′
landviare not identiﬁed, because in this
case a loop is obtained in the vertex viby the arc that is added in ˆH. Note that two vertices in
ˆHwhich where original consecutive vertices in D′are identiﬁed into two vertices which where
originally two consecutive vertices in D. Moreover, if v′
bv′
a∈A(ˆH), inHthis arc becomes the
arcvb−k+jva−k+jinH.
Lemma 1. Letn≥1and letDbe a symmetric cycle of order 2n+1+1with asymmetric arcs
v0v2n,vxva, wherex= 2n+a+1. LetD′be a copy of Dsuch that v′
i∈V(D′)is the copy of the
vertexvi∈V(D). ThenH= (D,vx,va)⊗(D′,v′
0,v′
2n)is a symmetric cycle of order 2n+1+1
with two asymmetric arcs v0v2n,v2n+2a+1v2a.
Proof.LetH= (D,vx,va)⊗(D′,v′
0,v′
2n), by Remark 1,
(i) the vertex v′
2n∈ˆHis identiﬁed with the vertex v(2n)−(0)+(a)=v2n+a=vx−1, so the arc
vxv′
2n∈A(ˆH) is transformed into the arc vxvx−1∈A(H), that is, an arc between two
vertices consecutive, therefore this arc is a symmetric arc.
(ii) The arc v′
xv′
adeˆHis transformed into the arc v(2n+a+1)−0+ava−0+a=v2n+2a+1v2a=
vx+av2aofH.
Note that the digraphs DandHonly diﬀer in two arcs, namely vxva=A(D)\A(H) and the
arcvx+av2a=A(H)\A(D), thusH=D+{vx+av2a}−{vxva}. In Figure 2 the dotted arrow
represents the deleted arc vxva.

Note that H0is a digraph of order 2n+1+1, with asymmetric arcs v2nv2n+1,v0v2n,v2n+1v0,
and the symmetric path v2n+1,v2n+2,...,v 2n+1,v0,v1,...,v 2n. LetH′

with vertex-set {v′
0,v′
1,...,v′
2n+1}wherev′
iis the copy of the vertex vifori= 0,1,...,2n+1.
LetH1= (H0,v0,v2n)⊗(H′
0,v′
2n+1,v′
0). In Figure 4, weconsiderthe directed Haj´ osunion and
2n+1vertex identiﬁcations. The digraph on the left indicates the directe d union of Haj´ os, where
the dashed arrows must be removed, the thick arrow added, the b lack vertices are identiﬁed, and
the shades of gray indicate the four pairwise vertex identiﬁcations . In each ﬁgure, the digraph
on the right is the result of the 2n+1+1 Haj´ os operations.
By Remark 1:
(i) The vertex v′
0∈V(ˆH1) is identiﬁed with the vertex v(0)−(2n+1)+(2n)=v2n+1, hence, the arc
v0v′
0∈A(ˆH1), becomes the arc v0v2n+1∈A(H1).
(ii) The arc v′
0v′
2n∈A(ˆH1) becomes the arc v(0)−(2n+1)+(2n)v(2n)−(2n+1)+(2n)=v2n+1v2n−1in
H1.
Thus,H1is a symmetric cycle of order 2n+1+1 with asymmetric arcs v2n+1v2n−1,v2n+1v0.A procedure to obtain symmetric cycles of any odd length using direc ted Haj´ os constructions 5

In order to simplify the writing we relabel (in cyclic order) the vertice s ofH1, fori=
0,1,...,2n+1,vi:=vi+1the index are taken modulo 2n+1+1.
Fork= 1,...,n−1, letHk+1=Hk⊗H′
k. By Lemma 1, Hk+1is a symmetric cycle of order
2n+1+1 with asymmetric arcs v0v2nandv2n+2k+1v2k. Applying Lemma 1, the digraph Hn+1is
a symmetric cycle of order 2n+1+1 with a unique asymmetric arc v0v2nbecause 2n+2n+1≡0
mod 2n+1+1.
Finally, let Hn+2= (Hn+1,v0,v2n)⊗(H′
n+1,v′
0,v′
2n). By Remark1, the vertex v′
2n∈V(ˆHn+2)
is identiﬁed with the vertex v2n−(0)+2n=v2n+1, thus the arc v0v′
2n∈A(ˆHn+2) is transformed
into the arc v0v2n+1∈A(Hn+2). Therefore, Hn+2=D(C2n+1+1).
Observe that we use only one directed Haj´ os operation (a directe d Haj´ os join) to obtain the
digraphH0. For each ofthe digraphs H1,H2,...,H n+2we use 2n+1+1 directed Haj´ os operations
(a directed Haj´ os join and 2n+1identiﬁcations), thus we use ( n+2)(2n+1+1)+1 directed Haj´ os
operations.
The Haj´ os number of an r-dichromatic digraph Hwas deﬁned in [19] as the minimum number
of Haj´ os operations needed to obtain HfromD(Kr).

3 Computational Complexity
In this section we determine the complexity of our procedure and wh ich is an upper bound for
the complexity of constructing a symmetric odd cycle using directed Haj´ os operations.
Theorem 4. Letn≥5be an odd integer. The complexity of the procedure to obtain D(Cn)from
D(K3)isΘ(nln(n)).
Proof.Letm≥2 and let nbe an odd integer such that n1< n≤n2with
n1= 2m−1+1and n2= 2m+1.
With our procedure, one needs
X=m
2(2m+2+m+5)−α (3.1)
directed Haj´ os operations to obtain a symmetric cycle of order nfromD(K3), where
α=/braceleftbigg5 if n < n2,
7 if n=n2.
Sincen1= 2m−1+1, then
n1−1 = 2m−1
log2(n1−1) =m−1,A procedure to obtain symmetric cycles of any odd length using direc ted Haj´ os constructions 7
therefore
m= log2(n1−1)+1. (3.2)
In equation 3.1 we have that
X=log2(n1−1)+1
2(2(log2(n1−1)+1)+2+(log2(n1−1)+1)+5) −α
=log2(n1−1)+1

nln(n)<13nln(n).
On the other hand, we have
X= 4n1log2(n1−1)+(log2(n1−1))2
2−log2(n1−1)
+4n1+log2(n1−1)
2−1−α

>(2m+1)log2(2m+1) = n2log2(n2)
≥nlog2(n)> nln(n).
Therefore nln(n)< X <13nln(n) and the complexity of our procedure is Θ( nln(n)).
4 Conclusions
Although it was proved in [3] that any 3-critical digraph can be cons tructed by a sequence of
Haj´ os operations, it is not a trivial task to obtain such a sequence even for simple digraphs such
as symmetric cycles of odd length and in particular, the symmetric cy cle of length 5. Using
genetic algorithm, we obtained in [11], a sequence of Haj´ os operatio ns for the symmetric cycle
of length 5, and generalizing this particular result permitted us to co nstruct any symmetric odd
cycle using Haj´ os operations.
We believe that these ideas can be used in order to obtain the 3- and 4 -critical tournaments
characterized in [21] and hopefully a improvement of the upper boun d for the minimum order of
a 5-critical tournament, which is known to be 19 (see 4.6. An applicat ion [22]).A procedure to obtain symmetric cycles of any odd length using direc ted Haj´ os constructions 8
