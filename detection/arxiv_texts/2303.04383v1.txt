SHINOBU HOSONO AND ATSUSHI KANAZAWA
Abstract. We introduce the BCOV formula for the lattice polarized K3 su r-
faces. We ﬁnd that it yields cusp forms expressed by certain e ta products for
many families of rank 19 lattice polarized K3 surfaces over P1. Moreover, for
Clingher-Doran’s family of U⊕E8(−1)⊕E7(−1)-polarized K3 surfaces, we
obtain the Igusa cusp forms χ10andχ12from the formula. Inspired by the
arithmetic properties of mirror maps studied by Lian-Yau, w e also derive the
K3 diﬀerential operators for all the genus zero groups of typ eΓ0(n)+.
1.Introduction
In 1993, Bershadsky, Ceccoti, Ooguri and Vafa (BCOV) introd uced the so-called
BCOV potential F1which gives the generating functions of genus one Gromov-
Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds generalizing m irror symmetry at genus
zero due to Candelas et al [13]. It involves an interesting in terplay between the
variation of Hodge structure and the Kähler geometry on modu li spaces of Calabi-
Yau manifolds. In fact, it originates from the so-called tt∗-geometry [12] on the
moduli space of N= 2supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld theories in two dimensions
in theoretical physics.
One of the main ingredients in the tt∗-geometry is a new type of Witten index
F1, introduced in [11, 12], for N= 2supersymmetric conformal ﬁeld theories. In
contrast to the Witten index, the new index F1is not topological but depends on
the moduli of a theory in a speciﬁc way; as a function on the mod uli space, F1splits
almost to a sum of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functio ns, but the splitting
is not complete. When the N= 2supersymmetric theory is given as a sigma model
over a Calabi-Yau manifold X, it satisﬁes the holomorphic anomaly equation

Kähler geometry relation [46] for a Calabi-Yau threefold X, BCOV integrate the
equation (1.1) as

text, there are special boundary points called the large com plex structure limits

is nothing but the BCOV potential F1when we determine f(x)by imposing suitable
boundary conditions. Writing Ftop

2logτBCOV, we callτBCOVthe BCOV formula.
The holomorphic function Ftop
1is particularly interesting for Calabi-Yau three-
folds as above. Considering Ftop
1for K3 surfaces, however, has not attracted much
attention, since there is no quantum corrections coming fro m holomorphic curves
for K3 surfaces. In this paper, we will introduce the BCOV for mula for K3 surfaces
and show that it is of considerable interest nevertheless, s ince it yields interesting
automorphic forms on the period domains.
LetMbe a lattice of signature (1,r−1)andM⊂Lbe a primitive embedding to
the K3 lattice L=U⊕3⊕E8(−1)⊕2. Assume the orthogonal lattice M⊥=U⊕ˇM
splits a hyperbolic lattice Uof rank two. Under this assumption, an M-polarized
K3 surface Xis mirror symmetric to a family of ˇM-polarized K3 surfaces which
are parametrized by the period domain ΩˇM. Studying the isomorphism classes in
more detail, we introduce ˇM-polarizable K3 surfaces whose isomorphism classes are
parametrized by a certain quotient ΩˇM/O(ˇM⊥)+of the period domain. Introducing
the mirror map ti=ti(x)(1≤i≤r), we deﬁne the BCOV formula (in Deﬁnition
3.1) by

where we impose suitable boundary conditions ( conifold andorbifold regularity
conditions) to determine the parameters ri,aj. Note that this deﬁnition naturally
follows from (1.3) by setting χ= 24 andh1,1
X=rand making an ansatz for fas
above. The K3 surfaces of degree 2nare described by a lattice M2n:=/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔2n/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔, which
gives rise to ˇM2n=/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2n/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔⊕U⊕E8(−1)⊕2. We calculate the BCOV formula for
the families of ˇM2n-polarizable K3 surfaces over P1studied in [39]. It turns out in
Propositions 4.1, 4.3 that(τBCOV)−1deﬁnes a cusp form on the upper half plane
H+with the modular group Γ0(n)+, which has the following special form of eta
product (Deﬁnition 4.4):
ηBCOV(t) =
/productdisplay
r|nηr(t)±1
w
.
We conjecture that this is true in general for families of ˇM2n-polarizable K3 surfaces
whose isomorphism classes are parametrized by ΩˇM2n/Γ0(n)+with the genus zero
modular group Γ0(n)+(Conjecture 4.8 ).
Interestingly, if we postulate Conjecture 4.8 and the arith metic properties of
mirror maps observed by Lian-Yau, a certain third order diﬀe rential operator, which
we call an K3 diﬀerential operator , follows for each genus zero group Γ0(n)+. We
summarize properties of K3 diﬀerential operators in Proposition 4.9 . A list of
K3 diﬀerential operators is provided in Addendum of this pap er [25].
As another interesting example, we calculate the BCOV formu la for the family
ofU⊕E8(−1)⊕E7(−1)-polarized K3 surfaces studied extensively by Clingher and
Doran [13], where a coarse moduli space is described in terms of the Siegel modular
2forms of genus two. After a suitable change of coordinates, w e ﬁnd that the Picard-
Fuchs diﬀerential equations are given by the extended GKZ sy stem introduced in
the 90s [26, 28]. In this case, it turns out in Proposition 5.6 that we have
(τBCOV(τ))−1= (χ10(τ))1
10,/parenleftBig
3χ12(τ)+χ10(τ)E4(τ)1

whereχ10,χ12are the Igusa cusp forms of weight ten and twelve, respective ly, and
E4is the genus two Eisenstein series. Here two possibilities a rise from two diﬀerent
boundary conditions (orbifold regularity conditions); on e of which we will interpret
in terms of the extension of the lattice polarization ˇMtoU⊕E8(−1)⊕2.
We describe the Weil-Petersson Kähler geometry on the modul i space of Calabi-
Yau manifolds. Introducing the so-called BCOV torsion TBCOV in terms of τBCOV,
we present some useful formulas which connect the Kähler geo metry to (quasi-
)automorphic forms on ΩˇM.
We brieﬂy sketch the construction of this paper. In Sect. 2, w e summarize the
theory of lattice polarized K3 surfaces and mirror symmetry among them. We
describe the period domain and automorphic forms on the doma in in detail to set
up notation. In Sect. 3, we introduce the BCOV formula τBCOVand calculate it
for the known ˇM2n-polarized K3 surfaces over P1in [39], and observe that they are
written by eta products of the speciﬁc form ηBCOV. Postulating the generality of
the results, we obtain K3 diﬀerential operators. In Sect. 4, we calculate τBCOVfor
Clingher-Doran’s family of K3 surfaces. In Sect.5, we intro duce the BCOV torsion
and express its relation to Weil-Petersson Kähler geometry on the moduli spaces
of lattice polarized K3 surfaces. We describe detailed calc ulations and data which
should be useful for the reader in Appendices A–D.

2.Automorphic forms on period domains
We ﬁrst describe families of lattice polarized K3 surfaces a nd their period do-
mains. Then we introduce automorphic forms on the domain by t he tube domain
realization.
2.1.Families of K3 surfaces and period domains. LetLbe the so-called
K3 lattice which is (a unique) even unimodular lattice of sig nature(3,19), i.e.,
L=U⊕3⊕E8(−1)⊕2, whereU=/angbracketleftbig
Z2,(0 1
1 0)/angbracketrightbig
represents the hyperbolic lattice and
E8(−1)is theE8root lattice with its bilinear form being multiplied by (−1). We
ﬁx a primitive sub-lattice M⊂Lof signature (1,r−1), and denote by CMone of
the (two) connected components of the positive cone deﬁned f orMinM⊗R.
2.1.1. Lattice polarized K3 surfaces. A K3 surface Xis a compact 2-dimensional
complex manifold satisfying KX= 0andH1(X,OX) = 0. By the Poincaré duality,
the bilinear form (,) :H2(X,Z)×H2(X,Z)→Zvia the cup product is non-
degenerate, and (H2(X,Z),(,))is a lattice which is isomorphic to the K3 lattice
L. A latticeNSX:=H1,1(X)∩H2(X,Z)is called the Néron-Severi lattice, and its
3orthogonal lattice TX:= (NSX)⊥inH2(X,Z)is called the transcendental lattice.
We call an isomorphism φ:H2(X,Z)→La marking of X, and a pair (X,φ)a
marked K3 surface. We summarize below theory of lattice pola rized K3 surfaces in
order.
(2.1.1.a) Let us consider a lattice Mof signature (1,r−1)and a primitive embedding
i:M ֒→L. We write the orthogonal decomposition i(M)⊕(i(M))⊥inLby
M⊕M⊥⊂Lwith suppressing the inclusion. A K3 surface Xis called of type
Mif there exists a marking φsuch thatφ−1(M)⊂NSX. A marked K3 surface
(X,φ)is calledM-polarized if Xis of typeMand all divisors in φ−1(Cpol
M)are
ample, where Cpol
Mis the positive chamber in CMdetermined by the roots ∆M=
{d∈M|(d,d) =−2}(see [16, 3]).
(2.1.1.b) Associated to the above orthogonal decompositio nM⊕M⊥⊂L, we deﬁne
the period domain ΩM= Ω(M⊥)as one of the (two) connected components of
DM=/braceleftbig
[w]∈P(M⊥⊗C)|(w,w) = 0,(w,¯w)>0/bracerightbig
,
i.e.,ΩM=D+
MwithDM=D+
M⊔D−
M. It is clear that we have [φ(ωX)]∈ΩM
for holomorphic two forms ωXofM-polarized K3 surfaces (X,φ). Conversely, by
the surjectivity of period map, for a point [ω]∈ΩMwhich we regard as a point in
P(M⊥⊗C)⊂P(L⊗C), there is a marked K3 surface (X,φ)such thatφ(CωX) = [ω].
Note that we have NSX= (CωX)⊥∩H2(X,Z), henceφ(NSX) = (Cω)⊥∩L.Also,
using the decomposition M⊕M⊥⊂Land the fact that φ(ωX)∈M⊥⊗C, we see
thatM⊂φ(NSX), i.e.,φ−1(M)⊂NSX. Composing suitable reﬂections by roots
inM(and also in M⊥∩(CωX)⊥) withφ, we can make all divisors in φ−1(Cpol
M)
be (pseudo-)ample. Hence, we have an (pseudo-ample) M-polarized K3 surface for
any point [ω]∈ΩM.
(2.1.1.c) We denote by O(M,L)the subgroup of the orthogonal group O(L)ofL
which ﬁxes every element in M⊂L. Using the decomposition M⊕M⊥⊂L,
the group O(M,L)naturally acts on DM. We denote by O(M,L)+the sub-
group which ﬁxes the connected component D+
M. This group O(M,L)+acts on
ΩM=D+
Mproperly and discontinuously. Two M-polarized K3 surfaces (X1,φ1)
and(X2,φ2)are deﬁned to be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism f:X1→X2
such thatφ1◦f∗◦φ−1
2∈O(M,L)+. If(X1,φ1)and(X2,φ2)are isomorphic,
thenf∗:H2(X2,Z)∼→H2(X1,Z)satisﬁesf∗(CωX2) =CωX1for holomorphic two
formsωXiofXi(i= 1,2). Correspondingly, the element φ1◦f∗◦φ−1
2∈O(M,L)+
maps the period point [φ2(ωX2)]∈ΩMto[φ1(ωX1)]∈ΩM. Hence, isomorphism
classes of (pseudo-ample) M-polarized K3 surfaces are parametrized by the quo-
tientΩM/O(L,M)+. The moduli space of isomorphism classes of M-polarized K3
surfaces is obtained by removing hyperplanes Hd={(x,d) = 0}ford∈∆M⊥from
ΩM, where we can only make divisors in φ−1(Cpol
M)be pseudo-ample by suitable
reﬂections by roots (see [16, 3] and (2.2) below).
(2.1.1.d) Let O(M⊥)+be the subgroup of O(M⊥)which ﬁxes the connected com-
ponentΩM= Ω(M⊥). SinceM⊥⊕Mis a primitive sub-lattice of L, which is even
and unimodular, we have O(M,L)+≃O(M⊥)+∩O(M⊥)∗where
O(M⊥)∗= Ker/braceleftbig
O(M⊥)→O(AM⊥)/bracerightbig
andO(AM⊥)is the orthogonal group on the discriminant AM⊥= (M⊥)∨/M⊥with
respect to the discriminant form qAM⊥(see e.g. [16, Prop.3.3]) .
(2.1.1.e) Mirror symmetry of K3 surfaces is described nicel y in terms of M-polarized
K3 surfaces when the orthogonal lattice M⊥ofM⊂Lsplits a hyperbolic lattice
4U, i.e.,M⊥=U⊕ˇMwith a lattice ˇMof signature (1,19−r) =: (1,ˇr). In fact,
in such cases, we can observe obvious symmetry in the relatio nM⊕U⊕ˇM⊂L
withr+ ˇr= 20. Describing suitable deformation spaces associated to MandˇM
precisely, it was argued in [16] that a family of ˇM-polarized K3 surfaces is mirror
symmetric to the family of M-polarized K3 surfaces.
2.1.2. Lattice polarizable K3 surface. Derived categories of K3 surfaces come into
mirror symmetry when we extend it to the so-called homologic al mirror symmetry
(see [37]). It was shown in [30] that homological mirror symm etry of K3 surfaces
is better described by introducing a family of M-polarizable K3 surfaces (see Sub-
sect. 2.1.3 below). A K3 surface Xis calledM-polarizable if there is a marking
φ:H2(X,Z)→Lsuch that (X,φ)is aM-polarized K3 surface.
IfM-polarizable K3 surfaces X1andX2are generic, i.e., satisfy φ−1
i(M) =
NSXi(i= 1,2), then there are corresponding M-polarized K3 surfaces (X1,φ1)and
(X2,φ2). When there is an isomorphism f:X1∼→X2, we have the corresponding
Hodge isometry f∗: (H2(X2,C),CωX2)∼→(H2(X1,C),CωX1)which entails φ1◦
f∗◦φ−1
2: (L,Cφ2(ωX2))∼→(L,Cφ1(ωX1)). Under the assumption of genericity, we
haveφi(NSXi)⊕φi(TXi) =M⊕M⊥⊂Land the restriction φ1◦f∗◦φ−1
2|M⊥
deﬁnes an element of O(M⊥)+. The induced action of φ1◦f∗◦φ−1
2|M⊥on the
period domain ΩMmaps the period point [φ2(ωX2)]to[φ1(ωX1)]. However, the
restrictionφ1◦f∗◦φ−1
2|Mneed not to be the identity idMin general.
Proposition 2.1. Letg·ωbe the natural action of g∈O(M⊥)+on a point [ω] =
CωinΩM= Ω(M⊥)⊂Ω(L). Assume that a primitive embedding M⊥֒→Lis
unique up to isometry of L, then every element g∈O(M⊥)+extends toφg∈O(L)
which deﬁnes a “Hodge” isometry φg: (L,Cω)∼→(L,Cg·ω).
Proof. Recall that we have ﬁxed our orthogonal decomposition M⊕M⊥⊂Lfor
a primitive embedding i:M ֒→L. This gives us a primitive embedding j:
M⊥֒→L. Forg∈O(M⊥)+, we have a primitive embedding j◦g:M⊥֒→L.
By the assumption of uniqueness, we then have an isometry φg∈O(L)such that
j◦g=φg◦j. Then, omitting jfor the embedding j:M⊥֒→L, we obtain
φg: (L,Cω)∼→(L,Cg·ω)for anyCω∈Ω(M⊥)⊂Ω(L). /square
As described above, by the surjectivity of period map, we hav eM-polarized K3
surfaces(X1,φ1)and(X2,φ2)satisfying [φ1(ωX1)] = [ω]and[φ2(ωX2)] = [g·ω]for
[ω],[g·ω]∈ΩM. Then, by the Torelli Theorem, the “Hodge” isometry φgin the
above proposition gives a Hodge isometry f∗
g=φ−1
1◦φg◦φ2: (H2(X2,Z),CωX2)∼→
(H2(X1,Z),CωX1)which comes from an isomorphism fg:X1∼→X2of K3 surfaces.
Hence, under the assumption in Proposition 2.1, the isomorp hism classes of M-
polarizable K3 surfaces are parametrized by the quotient
ΩM/O(M⊥)+.
Here, it should be noted that a larger group O(M⊥)+thanO(M⊥)+∩O(M⊥)∗≃
O(M,L)∗
+naturally appears to describe the moduli space if the above a ssumption
holds.
2.1.3. Mirror to K3 surfaces of degree 2n.The K3 surfaces of degree 2nare the
most general algebraic K3 surfaces described by a lattice M2n=/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔2n/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔. Associated to
a primitive embedding M2n⊂L, we have the corresponding orthogonal decomposi-
tion:M2n⊕(M2n)⊥=M2n⊕U⊕ˇM2n⊂LwithˇM2n=U⊕2⊕E8(−1)⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2n/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔.
We arrange this into two diﬀerent orthogonal decomposition s,
M2n⊕(M2n)⊥=M2n⊕U⊕ˇM2n= (ˇM2n)⊥⊕ˇM2n,
5which indicates that a family of M2n-polarized K3 surfaces is mirror symmetric to
a family of ˇM2n-polarized K3 surfaces in the sense of [16]. Since the primit ive em-
bedding(ˇM2n)⊥=M2n⊕U⊂Lis unique up to isometry (see [41, Thm.1.14.4],[40,
Thm.2.8]), the quotient ΩˇM2n/O((ˇM2n)⊥)+naturally appears as the moduli space
ofˇM2n-polarizable K3 surfaces when describing mirror symmetry.
Remark 2.2.In [30], it was found that the number of Fourier-Mukai partne rs of an
M2n-polarized K3 surface can be read from the “monodromy” group sO((ˇM2n)⊥)+
andO((ˇM2n)⊥)∗
+giving the moduli spaces of ˇM2n-polarizable and ˇM2n-polarized
K3 surfaces, respectively. For n>1, we can describe these groups by
(2.1) O((ˇM2n)⊥)+≃Γ0(n)+, O((ˇM2n)⊥)∗
+≃Γ0(n)+n
whereΓ0(n) :=/braceleftbig/parenleftbiga b
c d/parenrightbig
∈SL(2,Z)|/parenleftbiga b
c d/parenrightbig
≡(1∗
0 1)modn/bracerightbig
, andΓ0(n)+,Γ0(n)+n
are normalizers of Γ0(n)inSL(2,R)obtained by adjoining the Fricke and Atkins-
Lehner involutions; precisely, we deﬁne Γ0(n)+n=/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔Γ0(n),Wn/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔with the Fricke invo-
lutionWn=/parenleftbigg
01√n
−1√n0/parenrightbigg
, and similarly for Γ0(n)+with adjoining all Atkins-Lehner
involutions Wefore||n(i.e.e|nand(e,n/e) = 1) (see [15]). In [30, Thm.1.18], it
was found that the index [Γ0(n)+: Γ0(n)+n]coincides with the number of Fourier-
Mukai partners of a general M2n-polarized K3 surface [42], and interpreted from
the viewpoint of symplectic diﬀeomorphisms of mirror ˇM2n-polarizable K3 surfaces.
In the examples in Section 4, we will see that the monodromy gr oups (2.1) arise
from the Picard-Fuchs diﬀerential equations for suitable f amilies of K3 surfaces
studied in [39, 17, 49].
2.2.Automorphic forms. For each [ω]∈ΩˇM, the linear span RReω+RImω
deﬁnes a positive plane in M⊥⊗R. As the space parametrizing these positive two
planes, the period domain ΩˇM= Ω(ˇM⊥)is isomorphic to O(2,20−ˇr)/SO(2)×
O(20−ˇr), which is a symmetric domain of type IV. The BCOV cusp forms, w hich
we shall introduce in the next section, are special automorp hic forms on ΩˇMwith
respect to the natural action by O(ˇM⊥)+.
Let us assume a decomposition ˇM⊥=U⊕Mwithr+ˇr= 20as in the preceding
subsection. Then we can describe the period domain ΩˇMby a tube domain;
(2.2) ΩˇM≃M⊗R+iCM,
whereCM:={x∈M⊗R|(x,x)>0}+(as before { }+represents one of the two
connected components). To describe the isomorphism (2.2) e xplicitly, we take a
basise,f;b1,···,brofˇM⊥=U⊕Msatisfying (e,f) = 1,(e,e) = (f,f) = 0 and
(e,bi) = (f,bi) = 0 forU=Ze+ZfandM=⊕iZbi. We write a complex vector
w∈(U⊕M)⊗Cbyw= (w0,w(2),w(1)
1,···,w(1)
r) = (w0,w(2))⊕w(1)according
to the decomposition ˇM⊥=U⊕M. Then we have
(2.3) (w,w) = 2w0w(2)+(w(1),w(1))M,
where(,)Mrepresents the restriction of the bilinear form (,)toM⊗C. When we
introduce inhomogeneous coordinates by tk=w(1)
k
w0andF=−w(2)
w0, we can express
the isomorphism (2.2) by
[w] = [1,−F,t1,···,tr]/ma√s⊔o→(t1,···,tr).
Here we note that quadratic relation (w,w) = 0 forΩˇMis solved by F=1
2(t)2
M.
The coordinates t1,···,tr(orq2πit1,···,q2πitr) will be often referred to as the tube
domain coordinates.
6Recall the natural action of the arithmetic group O(ˇM⊥)+onΩˇM, which we
write by the linear action of g∈O(ˇM⊥)+onw∈ˇM⊥⊗Cbyg·w. If we
write the corresponding linear action on the “normalized” v ector(1,−F,t(1)
k)by
g·(1,−F,t(1)
k)= (D(g,t),A(g,t),B(g,t)), then this deﬁnes an action on the coordi-
natest1,···,trby
(2.4) [g·(1,−F,t(1)
k)] = [1,A(g,t)
D(g,t),Bk(g,t)
D(g,t)] =: [1,−˜F(t),˜t(1)
k],
where˜t(1)
k:=Bk(g,t)
D(g,t)(k= 1,...,r) are rational functions of t1,...,tr. We write this
action by ˜t=g·t.
Deﬁnition 2.3. A holomorphic function Ψ(t) = Ψ(t1,...,tr)onΩˇMhaving the
property
(2.5) Ψ(g·t) =D(g,t)mΨ(t) (g∈O(ˇM⊥)+)
is called an automorphic form of weight monΩˇM.
2.2.1. Example 1 (ˇM⊥=U⊕U).Consider a primitive embedding ˇM=U⊕
E8(−1)⊕2֒→Land the orthogonal lattice ˇM⊥inL. It is easy to see ˇM⊥=
U⊕U(=U⊕M), and the isomorphism ΩˇM≃M⊗R+iCM=H+×H+in terms
of the upper half plane H+. Since the primitive embedding ˇM⊥⊂Lis unique up
to isomorphism by [41, Thm.1.14.4],[40, Thm.2.8], the quot ient ofΩˇMby the group
O(ˇM⊥)+parametrizes the isomorphism classes of ˇM-polarizable K3 surfaces. For
the groupO(ˇM⊥)+=O(U⊕U)+, we note the following isomorphism:
O(U⊕U)+≃P(SL(2,Z)×SL(2,Z))⋊Z2.
Explicit generators of O(U⊕U)can be found in [31, Prop.2.5]; using the notation
there, the ﬁrst factor P(SL(2,Z)×SL(2,Z))is generated by S1,S2,T1,T2and
the second factor Z2is generated by R1R2. Precisely, since these generators are
given forO(2,2,Z), we need to translate these to our deﬁnition of O(U⊕U).
After the necessary translation, we verify the following ac tions on the tube domain
coordinates (t1,t2)∈H+×H+:
S1: (t1,t2)/ma√s⊔o→(−1
t1,t2), S2: (t1,t2)/ma√s⊔o→(t1,−1
t2)
T1: (t1,t2)/ma√s⊔o→(t1+1,t2),T2: (t1,t2)/ma√s⊔o→(t1,t2
t2+1)
andR1R2: (t1,t2)/ma√s⊔o→(−1
t2,−1

E7(−1)⊂Ldetermines an orthogonal lattice ˇM⊥≃U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔inL. Since the
primitive embedding ˇM⊥⊂Lis unique up to isomorphism as in Example 1, the
quotient ΩˇM/O(ˇM⊥)+parametrizes the isomorphism classes of ˇM-polarizable K3
surfaces. It is known that the period domain ΩˇMis isomorphic to the Siegel upper
half space H2of genus two, and the action of O(ˇM⊥)+=O(U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)onΩˇM
coincides with the standard modular action of Sp(4,Z)onH2. More precisely, there
is a group isomorphism
Ψ :Sp(4,Z)/{±I4}∼→SO(U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+,
whereSO(U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+=SO(U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)∩O(U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+. There is also an
isomorphism φ:H2≃ΩˇM(≃M⊗R+iCMwithM=U⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔) given by
τ=/parenleftbiggτ11τ12
τ21τ22/parenrightbigg
/ma√s⊔o→φ(τ) = [1,−detτ,−τ11,−τ22,τ12],
7where we note that the condition for the elements (−τ11,−τ22,τ12)∈M⊗R+iCM
is represented by Im(τ11)Im(τ22)−Im(τ12)2>0andIm(τ11)>0, i.e.,τ∈H2.
The following diagram shows that the isomorphism φis compatible with the group
actions:

whereΨ(g)∈SO(U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+andg∈Sp(4,Z)/{±I4}. If we write the standard
action ofg=/parenleftbiggA B
C D/parenrightbigg

g∗τ= (Aτ+B)(Cτ+D)−1,
then we can verify the above commutative diagram by the follo wing relation:
Ψ(g)φ(τ) = [1,−det(g∗τ),−(g∗τ)11,−(g∗τ)22,(g∗τ)12] =φ(g∗τ),
with the explicit form of Ψ(g)given in Appendix A.2. Noting that SO(U⊕2⊕
/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+≃O(U⊕2⊕ /a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+/{±I5}and{±I5}acts trivially on ΩˇM, we have
H2/Sp(4,Z)≃ΩˇM/O(U⊕2⊕ /a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+. Hence the ring of the automorphic forms
coming from ˇM-polarizable K3 surfaces parametrized by ΩˇMcoincides with that
of the standard modular forms on H2.
3.BCOV cusp forms
We will introduce the BCOV formula to deﬁne the BCOV cusp form s. The
BCOV cusp forms are special cusp forms on the period domains o f lattice polarized
(or polarizable) K3 surfaces. When we have explicit familie s of lattice polarized
K3 surfaces, we can compute the BCOV formula in terms of perio d integrals of the
families.
3.1.Mirror symmetry and mirror map. Suppose we have a family π:ˇX→ M
ofˇM-polarized K3 surfaces over some parameter space. Here and h ereafter, we
allow the ﬁbers of the family develop ordinary double points over a subset D⊂ M,
which we call discriminant of the family. Associated to the l ocal system R2π∗CˇX,
we have the period map
P:M →ΩˇM, x/ma√s⊔o→[/integraldisplay
γ1ωx,···,/integraldisplay
γ22−ˇrωx],
whereωx:=ω(ˇXx)is a holomorphic two form of the ﬁber ˇXxoverx∈ M, and
{γ1,···,γ22−ˇr}is a basis of the transcendental cycles in H2(Xx0,Z)with a base
pointx0. Assuming the decomposition M⊕(M)⊥=M⊕U⊕ˇM, we have the
isomorphism ΩˇM≃M⊗R+iCMas in (2.2) and also the relation r+ ˇr= 20.
As described in Subsect. 2.2, the coordinates tk∈M⊗R+iCMare given by
ratios of period integrals, and actually give a map from the u niversal covering
of the parameter space Mto the tube domain (which is called the complexiﬁed
Kähler moduli space of M-polarized K3 surfaces). This multi-valued map M →
M⊗R+iCMor its inverse relation is called the mirror map (see [39, 17, 49]).
83.1.1. Picard-Fuchs equation and local solutions. Period integrals can be character-
ized as the solutions of a certain set of diﬀerential equatio ns, called the Picard-Fuchs
equations. By making solutions of the Picard-Fuchs equatio ns near special bound-
ary points, called large complex structure limits (LCSLs), we can determine the
mirror map. In the case of Calabi-Yau complete intersection s in toric varieties, it is
known that LCSLs exist for a suitable toric compactiﬁcation MofM(see [28, 29]
and references therein). For a family of K3 surfaces, near a L CSL, we can ﬁnd
period integrals w0(x),w2(x);w(1)
k(x)which behave as
(3.1)w0(x) = 1+O(x), w2(x) =−/summationdisplay

(Kij)represents the Gram matrix of the lattice Mwith respect to the natural

series expansion:
(3.2) xk=xk(q1,...,qr) =qk+O(q),(qℓ=e2πitℓ).
Due to the quadratic relation, we can arrange the period inte grals as[w] = [w0(x),
w2(x),w(1)
1,...,w(1)
r]so that we have the period map P:M →ΩˇMin the from
given in Subsect. 2.2. In this form, the boundary point q1=q2=···=qr= 0(i.e.,
x1=···=xr= 0)is expected to correspond to a cusp point which we attach to
the period domain ΩˇMin the Baily-Borel-Satake compactiﬁcation. As we will see
in the next section, this is true when r= 1. However, as we can see in the example
in a recent work [32], the correspondence is more involved fo rr>1.
3.1.2. Monodromy group Gm.We denote by Gmthe global monodromy group of
the solutions (3.1) for the family ˇX→ M . By deﬁnition of the family, it is a
subgroup of O(ˇM⊥)+. As we will see in Sect. 4, there are many examples for which
Gm=O(ˇM⊥)+orO(ˇM⊥)∗
+holds when r= 1. However, the monodromy group
Gmis only a subgroup of O(ˇM⊥)+in general for r>1. It acts on ΩˇMand reﬂects
the multi-valued property of the period map P:M →ΩˇM. Then the mirror map
xk=xk(q1,...,qr)as the inverse of the period map is invariant under the action
t/ma√s⊔o→g·tofg∈ Gm⊂O(ˇM⊥)+on the tube domain coordinates.
3.1.3. Mirror symmetry and Griﬃths-Yukawa coupling. In the study of mirror sym-
metry of K3 surfaces, there are no quantum corrections from t he Gromov-Witten
invariants. Hence, the so-called Griﬃths-Yukawa coupling sCij=/integraltext

3.2.BCOV formula and cusp forms. Here we deﬁne the BCOV formulas for
the families of ˇM-polarized K3 surface. As in the preceding subsection, we co nsider
a primitive embedding ˇM⊂Lwith the property ˇM⊥=U⊕M.
Let us assume that we have a family ˇX→ M ofˇM-polarized K3 surfaces over
Mas in Subsect. 3.1. In order to have the topological limit (1. 3), assume also
that we have a LCSL at x1=x2=···=xr= 0by ﬁnding a compactiﬁcation
MofM. The aﬃne chart by the coordinates x1,···,xrare supposed to be dense
inM; e.g., this is the case if Mis given by a toric variety as in the examples in
9the following sections. A prototypical example is given by t he toric variety of the
secondary polytope. Near the LCSL, we have period integrals in the form of (3.1).
Following the deﬁnition (3.2), we determine the mirror map xk=xk(q)which has
q-series expansions of the form xk=qk+O(q). Over the parameter space M,the
ﬁbers of the family degenerate on the discriminant ∪iDi, whereDi={disi(x) = 0}
represent irreducible components.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (BCOV cusp form ).Under the assumptions above, near the
LCSL, we deﬁne the BCOV formula τBCOV, up to a multiplication constant, by
(3.4)τBCOV(t) =/parenleftbigg1

whereriandajare rational numbers which are restricted by suitable bound ary
conditions (which we will describe in Subsect. 3.3). When (τBCOV(t))−1deﬁnes a
cusp form on ΩˇM, i.e., an automorphic form which is holomorphic and vanishe s at
all cusps, we call it a BCOV cusp form.
In Sects. 4 and 5, we will ﬁnd in many examples that (τBCOV(t))−1deﬁnes a
cusp form on the period domain ΩˇMfor suitable values of riandai. Here we ﬁrst
show its modular property.
Proposition 3.2. The inverse power (τBCOV(t))−1of the BCOV formula has weight
one with respect to the action of Gm⊂O(ˇM⊥)+. Namely, it satisﬁes
(3.5)/parenleftbig
τBCOV(g·t)/parenrightbig−1=v(g)D(g,t)/parenleftbig
τBCOV(t)/parenrightbig−1
with the weight factor D(g,t)given in (2.4), and v(g)is a multiplier system which
is independent of tand satisﬁes |v(g)|= 1.
We prove this property by showing the following.
Lemma 3.3. Let[w] = [1,−F,t1,···,tr]be a point in ΩˇM≃M⊗R+iCMin
terms of the tube domain coordinates, and write the action of g∈ Gmon it by
[g·w] = [1,−˜F,˜t1,···,˜tr]as in (2.4). Then it holds that
d˜t1∧d˜t2∧···∧d˜tr= (detg)D(g,t)−rdt1∧dt2∧···∧dtr.
Proof. Recall that the tube domain coordinates t1,···,trare aﬃne coordinates of
the quadric {(w,w) = 0}inP(ˇM⊥⊗C). Let us write a point [Z]∈P(ˇM⊥⊗C)
by[Z0,Z1,···,Zr+1] = [u,v,z1,···,zr]according to the decomposition ˇM⊥⊗C=
(U⊕M)⊗C. Then the quadric relation is expressed by (Z,Z) = 2uv+(z,z)M=
0. The orthogonal group O(ˇM⊥)acts naturally on the linear coordinates Z=
(Z0,Z1,···,Zr+1)preserving the quadric. It also preserves the standard r+ 1
formdµZ:=/summationtext(−1)iZi∧dZ0∧ ···/hatwidestdZi··· ∧dZr+1up to sign, since we can write
dµZ=iEdZ0∧dZ1∧···∧dZr+1by the interior product iEwith the Euler vector
ﬁeldE=Z0∂
∂Z0+···+Zr+1∂
∂Zr+1. Note that in the aﬃne chart Z0/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0, we can
solve the quadric for vand obtain [w] = [1,−1
2(t,t)M,t1,···,tr]withti=zi

i= 1,···,r. Hence we can express the holomorphic r-form on the quadric by the
following residue around the quadric:
(3.6) Res(Z,Z)=0/parenleftbiggdµZ
2uv+(z,z)M/parenrightbigg
=ur
2dt1∧dt2∧···∧dtr.
Now consider the linear action ˜Z:=g·(Z0,Z1,···,Zr+1)ofg∈ Gm⊂O(ˇM⊥)on
Z. If we solve the quadric (˜Z,˜Z) = 0 for˜vin˜Z= (˜u,˜v,˜z1,···,˜zr), then we have
[˜w] = [1,−1
2(˜t,˜t)M,˜t1,···,˜tr]with˜ti=˜zi
˜u. Since the l.h.s. of (3.6) is invariant up
to the factor detgunder the linear action of g∈ GmonZ, we have
˜ur
2d˜t1∧d˜t2∧···∧d˜tr= (detg)ur
2dt1∧dt2∧···∧dtr.
10Identifying˜u
uwith the factor D(g,t)in (2.4), we obtain the claimed relation. /square
Proof of Proposition 3.2. We write the period map P:M →ΩˇMdescribed in
Subsect. 3.1 by
P(x) = [w0(x),w2(x),w(1)
1(x),···,w(1)
r(x)]
forx∈ M.This period map is multi-valued due to the monodromy of perio d
integrals. Using the mirror map x=x(t)in terms of the tube domain coordinates
t= (t1,···,tr), we can express the monodromy property of P(x)by
P(x(g·t)) = [w0(x(g·t)),w2(x(g·t)),w(1)
k(x(g·t))]
= [g·(w0(x(t)),w2(x(t)),w(1)
k(x(t)))]
= [D(g,t)w0(x),A(g,t)w0(x),Bk(g,t)w0(x)]
forg∈ Gm, wherex(g·t)should be read as a point on a covering /tildewiderMofM
which projects to x(t)∈ M. Note that the last two equalities hold without the
projectivization. Hence, we have
(3.7) w0(x(g·t)) =D(g,t)w0(x(t))
with the automorphic factor D(g,t). Also, by the above lemma, we have
∂(˜t1,˜t2,···,˜tr)
∂(t1,t2,···,tr)= detg(D(g,t))−r.
Using these relations, and the fact that the mirror map xk=xk(q)is invariant under
the monodromy group Gm, we obtain the claimed relation (3.5). The multiplier
systemv(g)depends on the branches of the factor/producttextx−1+aj
j if some ofaj’s are not
integral. /square
We remark that the relation (3.7) comes from the fact that w0(x)is a section
of the Hodge line bundle; which is given by the (2,0)part of the relative Hodge
decomposition of the sheaf R2π∗CˇXoverMfor the family π:ˇX→ M.
3.3.Boundary conditions. The above modular property holds for any choice of
the parameters riandaiin the BCOV formula. We can restrict these parameters
by imposing natural boundary conditions for the family π:ˇX→ M (cf. [7]), which
we describe as follows:
(1) The ﬁrst condition comes from the so-called conifold deg enerations. As
we deﬁned, the ﬁber K3 surfaces of the family π:ˇX→ M degenerate over
the discriminant D, where general ﬁbers acquire ordinary double points (ODPs) .
The Néron-Severi lattice enlarges after blowing up these OD Ps. We require that
log(τBCOV(t))−1is regular, i.e., (τBCOV(t))−1is regular and non-vanishing over the
discriminant D⊂ M. We call this condition a conifold regularity .
(2) The second condition comes from the boundary points cont ained in M\M .
Suppose that there is a boundary point given by the intersect ion point of normal
crossing divisors such that all monodromy actions Tiaround them are of ﬁnite
order. We call such a boundary point an orbifold point . Since the ﬁber K3 surfaces
naturally extend to orbifold points, we require that log(τBCOV(t))−1is regular at the
corresponding point in ΩˇM. We call this boundary condition an orbifold regularity
at the boundary point. If there are more than one orbifold poi nts, the regularity is
imposed by choosing one. Hence, depending a choice of an orbi fold point, we may
have diﬀerent boundary conditions (see Subsect. 5.3).
These two conditions are natural translation of those formu lated for the case of
Calabi-Yau threefolds [7]. It will be observed that the para metersriandaiare
11uniquely determined by these conditions for most cases in ou r examples in the next
sections.
3.3.1. Conifold regularity. We can implement the condition (1) by using the mirror
symmetry relation (3.3). Let us calculate the determinant o f (3.3) as
det(Cij)/parenleftbigg∂(x1,···,xr)
∂(t1,···,tr)/parenrightbigg2
= det(Kab)ω0(x)2r.
Using this relation, we have
(3.8) τBCOV(t) = det(Kab)1
2/producttextx−1+aj

w0(x)(det(Cij))−1

idisi(x)ri.
In this form, it is easy to implement the conifold regularity since it is straight
forward to evaluate det(Cij)for a given family π:ˇX→ M . In particular, for all
the examples in the present paper, we will see that the follow ing relation holds:
(3.9) det(Cij)/productdisplay
idisi(x)r/productdisplay
j=1x2
j=const..
Using this, we see that the conifold regularity holds if ri=−1
2for alli. Namely,
if we verify (3.9), the parameters riare determined completely by the conifold
regularity.
3.3.2. Orbifold regularity. We implement the orbifold regularity by choosing an
orbifold point from M\M . Let us assume that the relation (3.9) holds. Then by
the conifold regularity, we have the BCOV formula in the foll owing form:
(3.10) τBCOV(t) =const./producttextxaj
j
w0(x).
Let˜xibe the aﬃne coordinates centered at the orbifold point. For s implicity,
we assume that ˜xiare related to the aﬃne coordinates xicentered at the LCSL
by Laurent monomials xi=ϕi(˜x)(see the examples in the following sections).
Recall that the period integrals around the LCSL are arrange d so that P(x) =
[w0(x),w2(x),w(1)
1(x),···,w(1)
r(x)]is a point in ΩˇM; hencew0(x)/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0holds for
P(x)corresponding to smooth K3 surfaces. Consider an analytic c ontinuation of
w0(x)to the orbifold point, and express it by
w0(x) =c0˜w0(˜x)+c1˜w1(˜x)+···+cr+2˜wr+2(˜x),
where˜wk(˜x)are (ordered) local solutions of the Picard-Fuchs equation around the
orbifold point. If we order the solutions so that ˜wk(˜x)/˜w0(˜x)are regular, we have
w0(x) =c0˜w0(˜x)(1+O(˜x))withc0/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0sinceP(x)is a point in ΩˇMat˜x= 0. We
can now write the analytic continuation of the BCOV formula ( 3.10) as
(3.11) τBCOV(t) =const./producttext˜x˜aj
j
c0˜w0(˜x)(1+···),
where we have set/producttextxaj
j=/producttextϕj(˜x)aj=:/producttext˜x˜aj
j. In this form, we require that
log(τBCOV(t))−1is regular around ˜x= 0. Note that the parameters ˜ajare uniquely
determined by the exponent ρin˜w0(˜x) = ˜xρ(1+O(˜x)).
As above, the orbifold regularity is implemented for a choic e of an orbifold point
fromM \ M . Depending on the choice, the resulting τBCOV(t)can be diﬀerent.
Also, if there is no orbifold point, the regularity conditio n is vacant.
124.τBCOVand eta products
Here we present some explicit calculations of τBCOVcoming from ˇM2n-polarizable
K3 surfaces whose isomorphism classes are parametrized by H+/Γ0(n)+. An exam-
ple of a higher dimensional period domain will be considered in the next section.
4.1.Genus zero groups. Let us consider a family of ˇM2n-polarizable K3 surfaces
as a mirror family of an M2n-polarized K3 surface. As summarized in Subsect. 2.1,
the quotient ΩˇM2n/O(U⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔2n/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+≃H+/Γ0(n)+gives a coarse moduli space of the
family in general. We will calculate the BCOV formula when we have an explicit
realization ˇX→ M of the family with the parameter space being compactiﬁed by
M ≃P1. Here, we assume the isomorphism M ≃P1so that we can calculate
the period integrals by solving the Picard-Fuchs diﬀerenti al equation over P1. If
we have such a family and the monodromy group Gmof the family coincides with
Γ0(n)+, then we should have H+/Γ0(n)+≃P1(see [39, 49, 17]). Similarly, if we
have an explicit family of ˇM2n-polarized K3 surfaces ˇX→ M withM ≃P1and
Gm≃Γ0(n)+n, we should have an isomorphism H+/Γ0(n)+n≃P1. The modular
groupsΓ0(n)+andΓ0(n)+nwhich give rise to the isomorphisms as above are called
genus zero groups .
The list of genus zero groups Γ0(n)+nis classical due to Fricke [18, p.367], which
is given by
n= 2,3,···,21,23,24,25,26,27,29,31,32,35,36,39,41,47,49,50,59,71.
It was extended in [15] to Γ0(n)+adjoining all involutive normalizers, which we
list in Appendix B.1 with some additional data. In [15], cert ain generator of the
function ﬁeld of H+/Γ0(n)+≃P1is called the Thompson series, and its concrete
formula in terms of elliptic modular forms (in particular, t he eta function) is given.
For a genus zero group, if we have an explicit realization ˇX→ M as above, the
Thompson series coincides exactly with the mirror map of the family up to an
additive constant (see [39, 49, 17]).
4.2.Family of ˇM20-polarizable K3 surfaces. In [39], many examples of the
Picard-Fuchs diﬀerential equations for families of K3 surf aces over P1have been
listed, and the mirror maps have been identiﬁed with the Thom pson series. Many
of them are ˇM2n-polarizable K3 surfaces with the modular group Γ0(n)+.
As an example, let us consider the case n= 10. To describe the family, we start
with a K3 surface X= (1,1)4⊂P3×P3which is given as a complete intersection
of four general (1,1)divisors in P3×P3, whose mirror family can be obtained by
the Batyrev-Borisov toric mirror construction [5]. In fact ,Xis a Cayley model
of the Reye congruence, and its mirror family is parametrize d byP2. A family of
ˇM20-polarizable K3 surfaces appears when we restrict the param eter space to the
diagonal P1⊂P2. The Picard-Fuchs diﬀerential equation can be read from the
table of [39] as

whereθx:=xd
dx. This equation is singular at x= 0,∞and also at the zeros of
dis0dis1= 0withdis0= 1+4x, dis1= 1−16x. We summarize the data of the
singularities in Riemann’s Pscheme as

13As we see in this form, the origin x= 0is a LCSL, which corresponds to a cusp of
H+/Γ0(10)+. Around this point, for the regular solution w0(x)in (3.1), we have

3.3.1, we obtain r0=r1=−1

4. Since˜a=−a, we obtain a=−3
4.
By Proposition 3.2, we know that (τBCOV(t))−1is a modular form of weight one
with respect to O(ˇM⊥
20)+, which means weight two with respect to Γ0(10)+(see
Appendix A.1). From the modular property, the equality foll ows by comparing the
q-expansion of (τBCOV(t))−1and that of the eta product in the r.h.s. Finally, it is
clear that the eta product is a cusp from (cf. Lemma 4.2 below) . /square
A ﬁnite product of the eta functions,/producttext
m≥1η(mt)dmwithdm∈Z, is called an
eta product. Deﬁning N:= lcm{m|dm/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0}, we can write the eta product as
f(t) =/productdisplay
m|Nη(mt)dm=/productdisplay
m|Nηm(t)dm.
Eta products of this form are said of level N, since they are modular forms of
Γ0(N)(see [38] for example). Since the eta function η(t)has no zeros in H+, the
eta products are holomorphic on H+. The only possibilities are zero or poles at the
cusps in H+\H+. If an eta product f(t)vanishes at all cusps, then it is called a
cusp form. The following Lemma from [38, Cor. 2.3] is useful f or our calculations.
14Lemma 4.2. An eta product f(t)is holomorphic on H+if and only if the inequality
/summationdisplay
m|N(gcd(D,m))2
mdm≥0
holds for all positive divisors DofN. If the inequality holds strictly for all D, then
f(t)deﬁnes a cusp from.
For other examples in [39] of the families of ˇM2n-polarizable K3 surfaces with
the modular group Γ0(n)+, it is straightforward to calculate the BCOV formula. In
particular, if a family has an orbifold point, we can verify t he following properties:
1) the parameters riandain the BCOV formula are uniquely determined by the
conifold regularity and the orbifold regularity, 2) the res ultingτBCOV is an eta
product, 3) (τBCOV(t))−1is a cusp form of weight two with respect to Γ0(n)+.
4.3.Family of ˇM24-polarizable K3 surfaces. Let us consider a family of ˇM24-
polarizable K3 surfaces in [39] whose modular group is Γ0(12)+. The Picard-Fuchs
equation of this family is given by
/braceleftbig
θ3

and its singularities are summarized as

As we read from this, the zeros of dis= (1−4x)(1−16x)give conifold singularities,
whilex= 0and∞are both LCSL. Since we do not have an orbifold point in this
case, the form of τBCOV(t)is determined only up to a parameter a.
Proposition 4.3. With a parameter a, we have the following form of τBCOVin
terms of an eta product:
τBCOV(t) =const.xa
ω0(x)=const.x1+a/parenleftbiggη2(t)η6(t)
η1(t)η3(t)η4(t)η12(t)/parenrightbigg2
.
We leave verifying the above equality to the reader, since ca lculations are similar
to the preceding example. The parameter ais left undetermined as above. However,
we note that the mirror map x(q)(or the inverse of the Thompson series up to
additive constant) is given by the following eta product,
x(q) =/parenleftbiggη1(t)η3(t)η4(t)η12(t)
η2(t)2η6(t)2/parenrightbigg6
.
Namely,τBCOVis determined only up to multiplying some power of the eta pro duct
ofx(q). If we set a=−5
6, for example, we can verify that (τBCOV(t))−1is a cusp
form.
4.4.τBCOVin terms of eta products. The results in Propositions 4.1,4.3 suggest
the following deﬁnition for all genus zero groups Γ0(n)+listed in Appendix B.1.
Deﬁnition 4.4. For the genus zero group Γ0(n)+(n/\e}a⊔io\slash= 8,24,27,54and56), we
deﬁne the BCOV eta product by
(4.2) ηBCOV(t) =

r|nηr(t)±1
w
,
15where+1is taken when (r,n/r)/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1and−1when(r,n/r) = 1 . The power w
is determined so that the weight of ηBCOVis two (see Appendix A.1). For n=
8,24,27,54and56, respectively, we deﬁne ηBCOV(t)by
η1(t)3η8(t)3
η2(t)η4(t),η1(t)2η3(t)2η8(t)2η24(t)2
η2(t)η4(t)η6(t)η12(t),η1(t)3η27(t)3
η3(t)η9(t),
η1(t)2η2(t)2η27(t)2η54(t)2
η3(t)η6(t)η9(t)η18(t)andη1(t)2η7(t)2η8(t)2η56(t)2
η2(t)η4(t)η14(t)η28(t).
By calculating τBCOVexplicitly, we verify the following:
Proposition 4.5. For all families of ˇM2n-polarizable K3 surfaces listed in [39], the
following properties hold:
(1)By imposing the conifold regularity, we obtain
(4.3) τBCOV(t) =const.xa
ω0(x)=const.x(t)γ+a
ηBCOV(t)
whereγis determined by the condition x(t)γ/ηBCOV(t) = 1+O(q).
(2)The orbifold regularity condition, if there is, determines the parameterauniquely
to bea=−γ. The resulting τBCOV(t)deﬁnes a BCOV cusp from, i.e.,
(τBCOV(t))−1=ηBCOV(t)is a cusp form of weight two with respect to Γ0(n)+.
(3)If the orbifold regularity condition is vacant, the parameter ais left undeter-
mined. However, in such a case, mirror map x(q)is written by an eta product,
and there exists a choice of afor which (τBCOV(t))−1=x−a−γηBCOV(t)is a
cusp from.
Remark 4.6.In the list of [39], the case (3) occurs for n= 4,12,20and28. We
observe that, for these cases, the number of cusps of H+/Γ0(n)+is greater than
one. Let us denote by Nc(n)the number of cusps of H+/Γ0(n)+. We can see in [15,
Tables 2,3] that the Thompson series of Γ0(n)+with some additive constant, Tn(t)+
cn, can be written by some eta product if Nc(n)≥2except forn= 25,27,49,50,54,
see Appendix B.1. When Nc(n) =kandnis not in these exceptional cases, we can
read from [15, Tables 2,3] that there are k−1diﬀerent forms of eta products.
For all genus zero groups Γ0(n)+, except for n= 25,27,49,50,54, we can verify
the following property of the BCOV eta product in general.
Proposition 4.7. IfNc(n) = 1, thenηBCOVis a cusp form of weight two of Γ0(n)+.
IfNc(n)≥2, there exists an expression of the Thompson series Tn(t) +cnby an
eta product such that (Tn(t)+cn)bηBCOV(t)is a cusp form for some b∈Q.
Proof. WhenNc(n) = 1, it is straightforward to verify the claimed properties by
Lemma 4.2. When Nc(n)≥2, we can ﬁnd the claimed form of the Thompson series
from [15, Table 3]. In Appendix B.2, we list the product forms and the values of b
with the resulting cusp forms. /square
Based on this proposition, we conjecture the form of the BCOV formula under
the conifold and orbifold regularity conditions as follows :
Conjecture 4.8. For families of ˇM2n-polarizable K3 surfaces over P1, ifNc(n) =
1, then(τBCOV(t))−1=const.ηBCOV(t)and this deﬁnes a BCOV cusp on H+/Γ0(n)+.
IfNc(n)≥2andn/\e}a⊔io\slash= 25,27,49,50,54, then(τBCOV(t))−1=const.x(t)−bηBCOV(t)
with a parameter band this deﬁnes a cusp form for some b∈Q.
164.5.K3 diﬀerential operators. We need to know explicit families of ˇM2n-polarizable
K3 surfaces to verify Conjecture 4.8. Here, instead of seeki ng such families, we shall
determine diﬀerential equations of 3rd order by postulatin g that the conjecture
holds.
Let us assume that for each genus zero group Γ0(n)+there exists a series w0(x) =
1 +O(x)which is a solution of a 3rd order diﬀerential equation. If we assume
Conjecture 4.8 and also that the mirror map x(t) =q+O(q)is given by the
Thompson series Tn(t) +cnwith some additive constant, then by using (4.3) we
have
(4.4) w0(x) =x(t)−γηBCOV(t),
where we determine the parameter γby requiring that the q-series expansion of the
r.h.s has the form 1+O(q). Theq-series expansion can be transformed to x-series
by using the inverse relation q=q(x)of
x(t) =1
Tn(t)+cn.
Substituting the resulting x-seriesq=q(x)into the r.h.s. of (4.4), we obtain an x-
series expansion of w0(x). Now we can seek a diﬀerential operator which annihilate
the power series w0(x), which we shall call a K3 diﬀerential operator of Γ0(n)+.
Proposition 4.9. For each genus zero group Γ0(n)+listed in Table 1 of Appendix
B.1, there exists a K3 diﬀerential operator which has the fol lowing properties:
(1)It has a LCSL point at x= 0, and the mirror map reproduces the Thompson
seriesTn(t)+cnwith an additive constant cn.
(2)The number of LCSL points coincides with the number of cusps o fH+/Γ0(n)+.
(3)The regular power series solution w0(x)atx= 0satisﬁes the identity w0(x) =
x(t)−γηBCOV(t)in terms of the mirror map and the eta product.
Proof. Our proof is based on explicit calculations done for all case s. As an example,
we sketch the calculations to determine the K3 diﬀerential o perator for the group
Γ0(36)+. First, by our deﬁnition of ηBCOV(t), it is straightforward to have the
followingq-series
ηBCOV(t) =/parenleftbiggη2(t)η3(t)η6(t)η12(t)η18(t)
η1(1)η4(t)η9(t)η36(t)/parenrightbigg4
=q−3
2(1+4q+10q2+20q3+···),
from which we read γ=−3
2. We change this q-series tox-series by substituting
the inverse series of x= 1/(T36A(t) +c36A) =q(1−2q+q2+···)whereT36A(t)
is the Thompson series given in [15, Table 4]. We choose c36A= 2for the additive
constant so that we have the following product form:
T36A(t)+c36A=η2(t)2η3(t)4η12(t)4η18(t)2
η1(t)2η4(t)2η6(t)4η9(t)2η36(t)2=1
q+2+3q+2q2+···,
which can be found in [15, Table 3]. Inverting the q-seriesx= 1/(T36A(t)+c36A),
we obtain the following x-series
q=x+2x2+7x3+28x4+125x5+598x6+···.
Substituting the above x-series into the r.h.s. of the relation w0(x) =x−γηBCOV(t),
we obtain
w0(x) = 1+x+3x2+15x3+75x4+387x5+2037x6+···.
17Making the above series expansion up to order 60 and seeking a diﬀerential operator
which annihilate the series, we can ﬁnd the following diﬀere ntial operator:

Clearly the diﬀerential equation D36Aw(x) = 0 has the claimed properties (1) and
(3). As for (2), we describe the singularities of the equatio nD36Aw(x) = 0 in

and we see that D36Ahas four LCSL points at x=−1,0,1
3,∞, which correspond
to the four cusp points shown in the table of Appendix B.1. By s imilar calculations
for all other genus zero groups Γ0(n)+, we can ﬁnd K3 diﬀerential operators with
the claimed properties. We list the explicit forms of K3 diﬀe rential operators in
Addendum to the arXiv version [25] of this paper. /square
Remark 4.10.Here we remark on the additive constant in the relation1

cn. Changing the additive constant cnsimply results in a linear fractional transfor-
mation onx, i.e., an automorphism of the corresponding K3 diﬀerential equation. In
our listing [25], we have chosen cnso that we have integer coeﬃcients for the power
series expansion of w0(x)up to degree 20, if possible. However, when Tn(t)+cnis
expressed by an eta product, we have kept cnto preserve this property. /square
It should be noted that the K3 diﬀerential operators listed i n [25] are two di-
mensional analogues of the so-called Calabi-Yau diﬀerenti al operators considered
for Calabi-Yau threefolds in [1].

185.1.Normal form of ˇM-polarized K3 surfaces. In [13], Clingher and Doran
studied special quartic surfaces {f= 0} ⊂P3with
(5.1) f=y2zw−4x3z+3αxzw2+βzw3+γxz2w−1
2(δz2w2+w4)
where[x,y,z,w]∈P3andα,β,γ,δ ∈Care parameters. For ﬁxed α,β,γ,δ, the
minimal resolution of {f= 0} ⊂P3is denoted by X(α,β,γ,δ). The quartic fis
called a normal form of an ˇM-polarized K3 surface since the following properties
hold [13, Thm. 1.2]:
(1) Whenγ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0orδ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0,X(α,β,γ,δ)is anˇM-polarized K3 surface.
(2) For a given ˇM-polarized K3 surface X, there exists (α,β,γ,δ)∈C4, satisfying
γ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0orδ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0, such that X(α,β,γ,δ)is isomorphic to XasˇM-polarized K3
surface.
Taking the natural isomorphism X(α,β,γ,δ)≃X(t2α,t3β,t5γ,t6δ) (t∈C∗)
into account, the open variety
MCD:=/braceleftbig
[α,β,γ,δ]∈WP3(2,3,5,6)|γ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0orδ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0/bracerightbig
has been identiﬁed with a coarse moduli space of the ˇM-polarized K3 surfaces.
Since we have an isomorphism ΩˇM≃H2as shown in Subsect. 2.2.2, we have a
period map P:MCD→ΩˇM≃H2which is a multi-valued map. Note that, due
to the isomorphism Sp(4,Z)/{±I4} ≃SO(U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+≃O(U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)∗

where we use the fact that SO(U⊕2⊕ /a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+≃O(U⊕2⊕ /a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+/{±I5}andI5
acts trivially on ΩˇM. Namely, there is no distinction between ˇM-polarized and
ˇM-polarizable K3 surfaces in this case.

Clingher and Doran obtained Thm. 5.1 based on an argument whi ch is purely
geometric and does not involve any computations of period in tegrals. For a general
ˇM-polarized K3 surface Xcorresponding to [w]∈ΩˇM, they construct a new K3
surfaceYwhich is isogeny to Xand also carries a canonical Kummer structure.
Then the beautiful result above is derived by identifying an elliptic ﬁbration Y→P1
obtained in [14] and that for the Kummer surface representin gY. We shall present
explicit computations of period integrals of the family. To gether with the result
(5.2), we will calculate the BCOV formula.
5.2.Period integrals and Picard-Fuchs equations. We change the normal
form (5.1) to a diﬀerent form which allows us to write the peri od integrals explicitly,
in particular, by hypergeometric series. To this aim, let us introduce a slightly
general quartic polynomial
F(a) =a0xyzw+a1y2zw+a2x3z+a3xz2w+a4z2w2+a5w4+a6zw3
+a7yzw2+a8xzw2+a9x2zw
witha0,a1,···,a9∈C. We denote by Ftoric(a)a special form of F(a)with vanish-
inga7,a8,a9, i.e.,Ftoric(a) =a0xyzw+···+a6zw3. In order to describe symmetry
19ofF(a), we introduce a (non-reductive) group

Proposition 5.2. The following properties of F(a)hold:
(1)The quartic polynomial F(a)preserves its form under the linear change of
coordinates x,y,z,wbyG⊂GL(4,C).
(2)The normal form f=f(α,β,γ,δ)is transformed to a form Ftoric(a)by a

which turns out to be a reﬂexive polytope [4]. We also ﬁnd that the Laurent mono-
mials in ˆF(a) :=F(a)/xyzware in one to one correspondence to the integral points
∆∩Z3; in particular, the monomial a01corresponds to the origint(0,0,0)con-
tained in ∆, and monomials with coeﬃcients a7,a8,a9correspond to integral points
in the relative interior of codimension-one faces of ∆. LetP∆be the projective toric
variety associated to ∆, and consider a hypersurface ZˆF:={ˆF(a) = 0} ⊂(C∗)3
parametrized by a0,a1,···,a9. Then, due to [4], its closure ZˆFinP∆deﬁnes a
smooth K3 surface after making a MPCP (maximally, projectiv e, crepant, and
partial) resolution of P∆. Then the group Gin (5.3) represents the group of au-
tomorphisms of the toric variety P∆, and hence induces naturally isomorphisms
of the K3 surfaces {ˆF(a) = 0} ⊂P∆, which give rise to those of the quartics
{F(a) = 0} ⊂P3.
Actually, the form Ftoric(a)is a preferred form to analyze period integral in
terms of the extended GKZ system introduced in [28, Sect.2.3 ],[26], i.e., a Gel’fand-
Kapranov-Zelevinski (GKZ) hypergeometric system [19] wit h additional linear dif-
ferential operators representing inﬁnitesimal group acti ons ofGin (5.3). In fact,
for the K3 surfaces {F(a) = 0} ⊂P3, the reduced form Ftoric(a)gives a canonical
form of period integral as

whereˆFtoric(a) =Ftoric(a)/xyzwandC0={|x|=|y|=|z|=|w|=ε}(ε >0)is a

20Proposition 5.3. For the period integral w0(a), the following properties hold:
(1)The period integral (5.6) can be evaluated as
(5.7)w0(a) =/summationdisplay

c(l,m,n) =(2n)!
n!l!(n−m)!(3m−n)!(l−3m+n)!(m−2l)!
with understanding k! = Γ(k+1)for negative k.
(2)The series w0(a)is a hypergeometric series of GKZ type, which is a unique
regular solution of the Picard-Fuchs diﬀerential equation s (C.1) in Appendix
C. In particular, the origin (x,y,z) = (0,0,0)is a LCSL.
Proof. The residue calculation is straightforward, see [6] for exa mple. As described
brieﬂy above, the group Grepresents the group of automorphisms of P∆, and acts
naturally on the period integral w0(a). This entails exactly the extended GKZ
system in [26, 28]. We determine the Picard-Fuchs system (C. 1) as a minimal set
of diﬀerential operators whose solutions give rise to perio d integrals. Practically,
we can determine them by searching diﬀerential operators wh ich annihilate w0(x).
The claimed property at the origin follows directly by const ructing local solutions
around it. /square
The extended GKZ system is a system of diﬀerential operators which is naturally
deﬁned over a toric variety PSecPassociated to the so-called secondary polytope
[19, 2]; and the aﬃne coordinates x,y,z are for one of the aﬃne charts of PSecP. It
should be noted that the above nice properties of the period i ntegral indicate that,
if we change the normal form (5.1) to Ftoric(a), then we have a good family
(5.8) ˇX→ M= (C∗)3
to which our framework in Sect. 3 applies with M=PSecP. Here we deﬁne the

Since the origin (x,y,z) = (0,0,0)is a LCSL, we can determine the mirror map
from the local solutions around the origin following Subsec t. 3.1. In fact, we have
the following results:
Proposition 5.4. The relations (5.4) and (5.2) determine the mirror map as

Substituting these into w0(a), we havew0(x,y,z) =E4(τ)1

0a3, it is straightforward to verify the ﬁrst half of the claims. We derive the sec-
ond half by substituting these mirror maps into the hypergeo metric series w0(x,y,z)
in (5.7), and verify the equality up to suﬃciently high degre e in theq-expansions.
The claim follows since we know the modular property of w0(x,y,z)as described
in Sect. 3. /square
From the Picard-Fuchs diﬀerential equations, we can determ ine the Griﬃths-
Yukawa couplings Cij(x,y,z). Also, we ﬁnd that, except the divisor {xyz= 0}, the
21discriminant of the Picard-Fuchs equations consists of onl y one irreducible compo-
nent, i.e.,dis=dis0. Since both Cijanddis0are lengthy polynomials, we only
present some of them in Appendix C.2. Using these, we can veri fy the relation (3.9)
x2y2z2dis0det(Cij) = 2.
Combining this relation with the form of τBCOVin (3.8), we can impose the conifold
regularity, and then obtain
(5.9) τBCOV=const.xa1ya2za3
w0(x).
5.3.Regularity conditions at orbifold points. The coordinates x,y,z are those
of an aﬃne chart of a toric variety PSecPof the secondary polytope SecP deﬁned for
the regular triangulations of the integral polytope ∆in (5.5) [20]. As we summarize
brieﬂy in Appendix C.3, there are 16 regular triangulations Ti(i= 1,...,16)of∆.
The aﬃne coordinates x,y,z correspond to the triangulation T3, and the origin is a
LCSL where the hypergeometric series w0(x)in (5.7) is the only regular solution of
the Picard-Fuchs diﬀerential equations and all other solut ions develop logarithmic
singularities near the origin.
As we described in Subsect. 3.3 in general, there are orbifol d points among
the toric boundary points in PSecPwhich correspond to some triangulations Tk.
Such boundary points are characterized by the property that all local solutions of
the Picard-Fuchs equations have ﬁnite monodromy around the boundary divisors.
Precisely, since toric boundary points of PSecPare singular in general, we have to
make a suitable toric resolutions to express local solution s. Since the condition
that all local solutions have ﬁnite monodromy does not depen d on the resolution,
we simply say that a triangulation Tkrepresents an orbifold point if there is a
resolution for which all local solutions have ﬁnite monodro my.
Proposition 5.5. The orbifold points in PSecPare given by the regular triangula-
tionsT9,T12andT16. The local solutions from T12are isomorphic to those from
T16.
Proof. We have veriﬁed the claimed property by constructing all loc al solutions
explicitly for a toric resolution of the aﬃne chart for each Tk(k= 1,...,16). For
the triangulation Tk(k= 9,12,16), the forms of local solutions and also the aﬃne
coordinates of the resolutions are presented in Appendix C. 3. /square
Proposition 5.6. The orbifold regularity condition from each orbifold point in
PSecPdetermines the BCOV formula (5.9) as follows:
(1)From the regularity at the orbifold point represented by T12(orT16), we obtain
τBCOV=const./parenleftbigg1
χ10(τ)/parenrightbigg1
10
.
(2)From the regularity at the orbifold point represented by T9, we obtain
τBCOV=const./parenleftbigg1
3χ12(τ)+χ10(τ)E4(τ)1
2/parenrightbigg1
12
.
Proof. We start with τBCOVin (5.9) where the conifold regularity is already satisﬁed.
We implement the regularity at an orbifold point by doing ana lytic continuation of
(5.9) to the corresponding boundary point. Note that the aﬃn e coordinates x,y,z
in (5.9) are simply transformed to the aﬃne coordinates ˜x,˜y,˜zaround the orbifold
point, while the local solution w0(x)should be replaced by
w0(x) =c0˜w0(˜x)+c1˜w1(˜x)+c2˜w2(˜x)+c3˜w3(˜x)+c4˜w4(˜x),
22where˜wk(˜x)are the local solutions around the orbifold point. As shown i n Appen-
dix C.3, we ﬁx the solution ˜w0(˜x)so that˜wk(˜x)/˜w0(˜x)are regular. Recall that the
period integrals around the LCSL are arranged so that P(x) = [w0(x),w2(x),w(1)
1(x),
···,w(1)
r(x)]is a point on Ω(M⊥), hencew0(x)/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0holds for the period point P(x)
corresponding to a smooth K3 surface; which is the case for th e orbifold points.
Therefore we have c0/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0and
τBCOV=const.˜xa1˜ya2˜za3
c0˜w0(˜x)(1+O(˜x)),
wherexa1ya2xa3= ˜x˜a1˜y˜a2˜z˜a3. In this form, the orbifold regularity condition is
equivalent to the local behavior τBCOV=const.(1+O(˜x)).
For the orbifold point T12, we have
˜x=1
yz2,˜y=1
xz,˜z=z
and also ˜w0(˜x) = ˜x1

Then the result follows from τBCOVin (5.9) and formulas in Proposition 5.4. The

Remark 5.7.The modular form χ10(τ)is a well-studied cusp from on H2of the
modular group Sp(2,Z)[33, 9]. This also appeared in the study of heterotic-type
II string duality [36] (see also [23]), which is close to our s ubject here. In any case,
the BCOV formula deﬁnes a BCOV cusp from on ΩˇM≃H2when we implement
the orbifold regularity at T12orT16. The modular form 3χ12(τ) +χ10(τ)E4(τ)1
2
from (2) is a cusp form on H2. However, as we see in the fractional power of E1
2
4,
it is a cusp form for a smaller subgroup Gm⊂O(U⊕2⊕ /a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+whereGmis the
monodromy group of our family ˇX→PSecPin (5.8). We leave the problem of
determining Gmin future study.
5.4.Family ofU⊕E8(−1)⊕2-polarized K3 surfaces. Over the divisor {γ= 0} ⊂
P(2,3,5,6), the lattice polarization of Clingher-Doran’s family exte nds from ˇM=
U⊕E8(−1)⊕E7(−1)toˇMe:=U⊕E8(−1)⊕2(see [13, Sect.3.3]). Under the period
mapP:MCD→H2, this divisor is mapped to the Humbert surface given as the
vanishing locus of the cusp form χ10. We can observe this fact in the isomorphism
ΩˇMe= Ω(U⊕U)≃H+×H+where we use (ˇMe)⊥=U⊕U(see Example 1 in
Subsect. 2.2.1). Since the dimension of the deformation spa ce reduces while the
lattice polarization extends, we call the family over the di visor a reduced family.
Geometric aspects as well as modular property of the reduced family were studied in
detail in [14]. Also, since all calculations are parallel to those for Clingher-Doran’s
family presented in the preceding subsections, we only sket ch them below for this
reduced family.
5.4.1. Period integrals and mirror map. We continue to work on the family ˇX→
PSecPobtained from (5.8). Then since a3=γby Proposition 5.2, the divisor
{γ= 0}corresponds to a toric divisor {a3= 0}inPSecP. To describe the reduced
family, let ∆redbe the integral polytope ∆in (5.5) with the third vertext(0,−1,1)
being removed. It turns out that this reduced polytope is sti ll reﬂexive, and all
toric constructions in the preceding subsections work with
Fred
toric(a) :=Ftoric(a)|a3=0.
23In particular, the period integral (5.6) deﬁnes the corresp onding period integral by
wred
0(a) =w0(a)|a3=0. Also, we can describe the reduced family ˇXred→PSecPred
as the quotient of/braceleftbig
Fred
toric(a) = 0/bracerightbig
⊂P∆red×C6by the action (C∗)3×C∗with the
secondary polytope SecPredfor∆red. Actually, this reduced family is known as a
mirror family of a hypersurface of degree twelve in the weigh ted projective space
P(6,4,1,1).
Proposition 5.8. For the reduced family, we have the following results:
(1)The period integral wred
0(a)is given by

(2)The origin (u,v) = (0,0)is a LCSL.
(3)Around the LCSL in (2), we have the mirror map

(E4/tildewideE4)3
2, v= (864)2η24/tildewideη24
(E4/tildewideE4)3

where we deﬁne Ek:=Ek(τ11),/tildewideEk:=Ek(τ22)with the elliptic Eisenstein
seriesEk, and setη:=η(τ11)and/tildewideη:=η(τ22). Substituting the mirror map
intowred
0(a), we also have wred
0(a) =E1

Proof. It is straightforward to have (1) from (5.7). The property (2 ) follows by
solving the Picard-Fuchs equations of the reduced family, w hich we leave to the
reader. The mirror map and the relation wred
0(a) =E1
4
4/tildewideE1
4
4follow from Proposition
5.4. In the derivation, we use the relations
χ10(τ)→0, χ12(τ)→η24/tildewideη24,E4(τ)→E4/tildewideE4,E6(τ)→E6/tildewideE6
under the limit τ12→0whereτ= (τ11τ12τ21τ22)∈H2. /square
5.4.2. BCOV cusp form. We sketch the computation of the BCOV cusp from of
the reduced family. Since we can verify the relation (3.9) fo r the Griﬃths-Yukawa
couplings, we start from
τred
BCOV(t) =const.uavb
wred
0(u,v).
The secondary polytope SecPredhas four vertices corresponding to regular trian-
gulations of ∆red. Making local solutions, we can identify one of the four tria n-
gulations with an orbifold point, which we denote by Tred
4. Imposing the orbifold
regularity on τred
BCOV(t)atTred
4inPSecPred, we ﬁnd that (a,b) = (−1
6,−1
12). Then,
using (5.10) and the relation wred
0(u,v) =E1

4, we obtain
τred
BCOV=const./parenleftbigg1

η2˜η2.
The inverse power (τred
BCOV)−1clearly deﬁnes a cusp form on H+×H+, hence we
obtain a BCOV cusp form from the BCOV formula.
Remark 5.9.As we notice, the BCOV cusp form (τred
BCOV)−1directly follows as the
limit of(τBCOV)−1for the case (2) in Proposition 5.6 where we impose the orbifo ld
regularity at the orbifold point corresponding to the trian gulationT9inPSecP. Note
that one of the faces of SecP can be identiﬁed with SecPredsincePSecPredis a toric
divisor on PSecP. The triangulation Tred
4corresponds to T9under this relation
SecPred≺SecP. This explains that (τred
BCOV)−1follows from (τBCOV)−1for the case
24(2) in Proposition 5.6. On the other hand, the cusp from (τBCOV)−1=const.(χ10)1
10
for the case (1) does not reduce to a non-trivial BCOV cusp fro m. This can be
explained by the fact that the orbifold points correspondin g toT10andT16do not
reduce to any point on the divisor PSecPredofPSecP. Reversing the arguments, one
can say that (τBCOV)−1=const.(χ10)1
10is a genuine BCOV cusp form which arises
for theˇM-polarized K3 surfaces.
6.Weil-Petersson geometry and BCOV torsion
Here we collect some formulas which relate the BCOV formula w ith the Weil-
Petersson Kähler geometry on the moduli space of K3 surfaces . Related geometry
will be studied more in detail in [21].
6.1.The Weil-Petersson metric. LetˇX→ M be a family of ˇM-polarized (or
polarizable) K3 surfaces. As in Sect. 3, we describe the peri od mapP:M →ΩˇM
byP(x) = [w(x)]∈ΩˇMin terms of the period integrals
w(x) =/parenleftbig
w0(x),w(2)(x),w(1)
1(x),···,w(1)
r(x)/parenrightbig
which satisfy the quadratic relation (w,w) = 2w0w(2)+(w(1),w(1))M= 0. Here by
deﬁnition of ΩˇM= Ω(ˇM⊥)and the assumption ˇM⊥=U⊕M, we use the bilinear
form(,)of the lattice U⊕M, and denote by (,)Mits restriction to M.
Due to [47], we introduce the Weil-Petersson metric on Min terms of the fol-
lowing Kähler potential
K(x,¯x) =−log/parenleftbig
w(x),w(x)/parenrightbig
,
and denote the Kähler metric by gi¯j:=∂
∂xi∂
∂xjK(x,¯x). In order to write the
corresponding metric on the tube domain M⊗R+iCM, we set (t)2
M:= (t,t)M
for the tube domain coordinates t= (ta) := (t1,···,tr). In what follows, we use
the indices a,b,c,... for the coordinates t= (ta), whilei,j,k,... for the coordinates
x= (x1,...,xr).
Lemma 6.1. Using the deﬁnition ta=w(1)
a(x)
w0(x), we have
(6.1)/parenleftbig
w(x),w(x)/parenrightbig
=−1
2w0(x)w0(x)(t−¯t)2
M.
Proof. From the quadratic relation (w,w) = 0, we havew(x) =w0(x)(1,−1
2(t)2
M,t1,
···,tr). The equality follows immediately from this. /square
With the above equality, we may write the Kähler metric on the tube domain
asga¯b=−∂
∂ta∂
∂¯tblog/parenleftbig
−(t−¯t)2
M/parenrightbig
. Here it should be noted that (t−¯t)2
M<0.
The Kähler metric gi¯j(orga¯b) deﬁnes the so-called special Kähler geometry on the
moduli spaces, and this provides a profound connection to th ett∗-geometry which
will be the subject in [21].
6.2.BCOV torsion. Let us note that the equation (6.1) is monodromy invariant,
hence it is globally deﬁned over M. Also, the period integral w0(x)is regarded
as a section of the Hodge bundle over M, and transforms as automorphic form of
weight one as we saw in Sect. 3. By Proposition 3.2, we know tha t the BCOV
formula(τBCOV(t))−1has weight one with some multiplier system v(g). From these
properties, we naturally come to the following deﬁnition:
25Deﬁnition 6.2 (BCOV torsion ).As aC∞function over ΩˇM≃M⊗R+iCM,
or its quotient ΩˇM/Gmby the monodromy group Gm, we deﬁne the BCOV torsion
bylogTBCOV with
(6.2) TBCOV(t,¯t) :=−(t−¯t)2
M(τBCOV(t))−1(τBCOV(t))−1.
In the original work by BCOV [7], it was conjectured that the B COV torsion
coincides with the so-called Ray-Singer analytic torsion [ 45] for Calabi-Yau mani-
folds in general. We refer [34, 48] for some results on the ana lytic torsions of K3
and Enriques surfaces. Here it should be useful to see how the se torsions are re-
lated for the case of elliptic curve: For a family of elliptic curves, the Ray-Singer
analytic torsion is deﬁned as the (modiﬁed) determinant of L aplace operator [45]
[2, eq.(5.17)] by
(6.3) TE
RS=det′∂τ∂τ= log/braceleftBig
(−i)(τ−τ)η(τ)2η(τ)2/bracerightBig
,
wheredet′means omitting zero eigenvalues. In this form, the Ray-Sing er analytic
torsion represents the Quillen’s norm of determinant line b undle [43]. As a family
of elliptic curves, we take the Weierstrass normal form of th e family. For this
family, similar calculations as in Sect. 5 apply. We have the BCOV formula τBCOV
similar to (3.4) and obtain (τBCOV(τ))−1=η(τ)2by calculating the mirror map.
Also, we have the Kähler potential of the Poincaré metric on H+asK(τ,¯τ) =
−log/parenleftbig
w0(x)w0(x)(−i)(τ−¯τ)/parenrightbig
withτ=I1(x)
I0(x)andI0(x) =w0(x)(see Appendix D
for details). Then, replacing the “norm” factor −(t−¯t)2
Min (6.2) with (−i)(τ−¯τ),
we verify the relation TE
RS= logTE
BCOV.
6.3.Quasi-automorphic forms. The function TE
BCOV is aC∞function on the
fundamental domain H+/PSL(2,Z). Taking the derivative of logTE
BCOV, we have

2(τ,¯τ)
gives the standard elliptic Eisenstein series E2(τ). SinceE2(τ)itself does not have
a modular property, it is called a quasi-modular form (see [3 5]). For K3 surfaces,
corresponding to (6.4), we introduce propagator function by

for the Griﬃths-Yukawa couplings since these are rational f unctions of x=x(t)
which is invariant under the monodromy, i.e., x(g·t) =x(t). Since the relation
(6.6) is an identity on ΩˇM, which is invariant under the monodromy group Gm, we

Appendix A.Isomorphisms of modular groups
A.1.Homomorphism Γ0(n)+→O(U⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔2n/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔).For reader’s convenience, we present
an explicit form of group homomorphism Γ0(n)+→O(U⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔2n/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)which gives the
isomorphisms (2.1) for n>1. Its derivation can be found in [17, Thm.7] for exam-

whereψ(A)·φ(t)represents the natural linear action of ψ(A)onφ(t). This indicates
that we should read D(A,t) = (ct+d)2for the automorphic factor D(A,t)in (2.5).
This means that the weight of an automorphic form of the group O(U⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔2n/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)should
be doubled when we read it as a modular form of Γ0(n)+.

module generated by e1,e2,e3,e4. We consider the natural action of SL(4,Z)on
VZ. Let∧2VZbe the exterior power and take a basis ei∧ej(1≤i < j≤4)of it.
We deﬁne a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form (,)on∧2VZby
X∧Y=: (X,Y)e1∧e2∧e3∧e4
forX=/summationtextxijei∧ejandY=/summationtextyijei∧ej. We denote the natural action of SL(4,Z)
on∧2Vbyρ∧(g)(X) :=gXtg. Then it is easy to verify that (ρ∧(g)(X),ρ∧(g)(Y)) =
(detg)(X,Y) = (X,Y)forg∈SL(4,Z).
Consider an element W:=e1∧e3−e2∧e4and deﬁne a group

E1,F1,E2,F2,A:=e1∧e2, e3∧e4, e2∧e3, e1∧e4, e1∧e3+e2∧e4.
It is easy to verify that non-vanishing pairings of these gen erators are (E1,F1) =
(E2,F2) = 1,(A,A) =−2. HenceW⊥≃U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔, and˜Γacts onW⊥preserving
the bilinear form, i.e., ρ∧(˜Γ)⊂O(W⊥). Now, the isomorphism ρ∧:˜Γ/{±I4}∼→
SO(U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+follows by studying the homomorphism ρ∧:˜Γ→O(W⊥)(see
e.g. [22] for more details).
We can write the condition for g∈˜Γexplicitly as
g/parenleftbigg0 0 1 0
0 0 0−1
−1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0/parenrightbigg
tg=/parenleftbigg0 0 1 0
0 0 0−1
−1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0/parenrightbigg
.
Comparing this with the deﬁnition Sp(4,Z) :=/braceleftbig
x|tx/parenleftbig0E2
−E20/parenrightbig
x=/parenleftbig0E2
−E20/parenrightbig/bracerightbig
, we
describe the (anti-)isomorphism Sp(4,Z)≃˜Γbyx/ma√s⊔o→ItxIwithI= diag(1,1,1,−1).
Then we can write the isomorphism Ψ :Sp(4,Z)/{±I4} ≃SO(U⊕2⊕/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔−2/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)+ex-
plicitly by
Ψ(g) =ρ∧(IgI),(g∈Sp(4,Z)/{±I4}).
Using this, we verify the commutative diagram (2.6).
Appendix B.Table of Γ0(n)+
B.1.Table of Γ0(n)+.In the following Table 1, we list all genus zero groups Γ0(n)+
which we read from a larger list in [15]. The “type” in the seco nd column means the
name used in the listing there. In the third column, the numbe rsNc(n)of cusps of
H+/Γ0(n)+are listed. The case n= 1is included by setting Γ0(1)+≡PSL(2,Z)
as a convention. We see in [15, Table 3] that, if the number cus psNc(n)is greater
than 1, the Thompson series Tn(t)ofΓ0(n)+has an expression by an eta product
except forn= 25,27,49,50and54(which we indicate by * in the table).

29Appendix C.Clingher-Doran’s family
C.1.Picard-Fuchs equations. The Period integral (5.6) is a solution of the
Picard-Fuchs equations Diw0(x) = 0 (i= 1,2,...,5)with
(C.1)D1=θx(θx−3θy+θz)−x(2θx−θy+1)(2θx−θy),
D2= (θy−θz)(θx−3θy+θz)+2z(2θz+1)(3θy−θz),
D3= (2θx−θy)(3θy−θz)+2yz(θx−2θy−1)(θx−3θy+θz)
+2yz2(2θz+1)(3θx−6θy+2θz),
D4= (2θx−θy)(θy−θz)−4yz2(2θy+3)(θx−3θy+θz)
−8yz3(2θz+1)(6θy+4θz+15),
D5=θx(3θy−θz)+2xyz(2θx−θy)(θx−3θy+θz)
+12xyz2(2θx−θy)(2θz+1).
These diﬀerential operators should follow from the extende d GKZ system as done in
[26, 28]. Here we have determined these as a system of diﬀeren tial operators which
annihilate the hypergeometric series w0(x)in (5.7). The completeness of these to
determine all other period integrals can be veriﬁed by calcu lating the indicial ideal
atx=y=z= 0(see [28]).
C.2.Griﬃths-Yukawa couplings. LetˇX→ M be Clingher-Doran’s family, and
Ω := Ω(x)be a holomorphic two form of the ﬁber K3 surface Xxoverx∈ M. Using
the notation (A,B) :=/integraltext
XxA∧BforA,B∈H2(Xx,C), we deﬁne the Griﬃths-
Yukawa couplings by Cij:= (Ω,∂i∂jΩ)where we set (∂1,∂2,∂3) := (∂
∂x,∂
∂y,∂
∂z). By
the Griﬃths transversality, we have (Ω,Ω) = (Ω,∂iΩ) = 0 . Using these relations,
we have
(Ω,∂i∂j∂kΩ) =1
2∂i(Ω,∂j∂kΩ)+1
2∂j(Ω,∂i∂kΩ)+1
2∂k(Ω,∂i∂jΩ).
Then, by evaluating (Ω,∂iDaΩ)fori= 1,2,3,a= 1,...,5, we obtain a system
of ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations for Cij. By integrating these equations, we can
determineCijup to a multiplicative constant (see [10, 26]). For example, we obtain
C11=˜C11/dis0with
˜C11= 2y2z2/parenleftbig

30C.3.Local solutions around orbifold points. The extended GKZ system (C.1)
is an irreducible system of the GKZ system determined by the p oint conﬁguration
A3={v1,v2,...,v6}which we deﬁne by writing (5.5) ∆ = Conv .{v1,···,v6}.
Precisely, adding the origin v0and putting the points on an aﬃne plane by ¯vi:=
t(1,vi), the point conﬁguration is given by

and the GKZ system is the A-hypergeometric system with exponent β=t(−1,0,0,0).
As an irreducible system of GKZ system, the extended GKZ syst em (C.1) shares
the compactiﬁcation of the parameter space with the GKZ syst em, which is given
byPSecPwith the secondary polytope SecP. The secondary polytope is deﬁned as
the convex hull of vertices vTparametrized by regular triangulations TofA. In the
present case, we can calculate all regular triangulations ( e.g. by using TOPCOM
[44]). It turns out that there are 16 regular triangulations Tk(k= 1,...,16).We
refrain listing all of them, but we list those which correspo nd to orbifold points
here;
T9={{1,2,3,4},{1,2,4,5}},
T12={{1,3,4,5},{1,2,3,5}}, T16={{1,3,5,6},{1,3,4,6},{1,2,3,5}},
where numbers irepresent the point ¯viofA, and{1,2,3,4}, for example, represents
a simplex of the triangulation of Conv. (A). Since it is straightforward to obtain the
following results, although we need some calculations, we o nly list local solutions
of (C.1) which we obtain for the above three triangulations.
•T9. Following [20], we can determine the aﬃne chart AT9corresponding to the
triangulation T9as
AT9= SpecC[σ∨
T9∩Z3]
where we deﬁne a cone σ∨
T9=R≥0t(1,2,0)+R≥0t(−1,−2,−6)+R≥0t(−1,0,0)and
make the identiﬁcation xm1ym2zm3witht(m1,m2,m3)∈Z3. This chart is singular
at the origin, and we have to resolve the singularity. Howeve r, as explained in the
text, the orbifold regularity condition does not depend on t he resolution, and we
can impose the regularity condition at any aﬃne chart of the r esolution. Making a
resolution, we consider the following (smooth) aﬃne coordi nates which are related
to the aﬃne coordinates x,y,z for the LCSL:
(˜x,˜y,˜z) = (1
xy2z2,yz,xy).
Using these coordinates, the local solutions ˜wk(˜x)are given by
˜w0=˜x5
12˜y1
3˜z1
3(1+···),˜w1=˜x1
2˜y1
2˜z1
2(1+···),˜w2=˜x7
12˜y2
3˜z2
3(1+···)
˜w3=˜x11
12˜y4
3˜z1
3(1+···),˜w4=˜x13
12˜y5
3˜z2
3(1+···),
where˜w0is the unique solution with the property that ˜wk/˜w0are regular. In the
above equations, ···represents higher order terms O(˜x)with respect to ˜x,˜y,˜z.
•T12. In a similar way as above, we have
AT12= SpecC[σ∨
T12∩Z3]
withσ∨
T12=R≥0t(−1,−2,0)+R≥0t(−1,−2,−5)+R≥0t(−1,0,0). Making a reso-
lution of the singularity of AT12at the origin, we take the following (smooth) aﬃne
coordinates:
(˜x,˜y,˜z) = (1
yz2,1
xz,z).
31Using these coordinates, the local solutions ˜wk(˜x)are given by
˜w0=˜x1
5˜y1
10(1+···),˜w1=˜x2
5˜y7
10(x+c1z+···),
˜w2=˜x3
5˜y3
10(1+···),˜w3=˜x4
5˜y9
10(x+c2z+···),˜w4= ˜x˜y(1+···),
wherec1=−38400
11,c2=−153600
119and˜w0is the unique solution with the property
that˜wk/˜w0are regular. As above, ···represents higher order terms.
•T16. For this, we can calculate
AT16= SpecC[σ∨
T16∩Z3]
withσ∨
T16=R≥0t(1,0,0)+R≥0t(−1,−2,−5)+R≥0t(−3,−2,0). As aﬃne coordi-
nates of a resolution of AT16, we take
(˜x,˜y,˜z) = (1
x3y,x,x
z).
Using these coordinates, the local solutions ˜wk(˜x)are given by
˜w0=˜x1
5˜z1
2(1+···),˜w1=˜x2
5˜z1
2(1+···),˜w2=˜x3
5˜z1
2(1+···)
˜w3=˜x4
5˜z1
2(1+···),˜w4=˜x˜z1
2(1+···),
where˜w0is the unique solution with the property that ˜wk/˜w0are regular. As
above,···represents higher order terms.
Remark C.1.Although we do not describe details, all the regular solutio ns above
are given by hypergeometric series due to GKZ, which have the form

Appendix D.τBCOVfor elliptic curves
D.1.Period integrals and Picard-Fuchs equation. Clingher-Doran’s family
(5.1) is a generalization of the Weierstrass normal form of a family of elliptic curves;
y2= 4x3−g2x−g3whereg2= 12E4(τ),g3= 216E6(τ)with the standard Eisenstein
seriesE4andE6. It is a classical fact that the weighted projective space P1(2,3)
of points [g2,g3]gives a coarse moduli space of elliptic curves. Period integ rals of
this family of elliptic curve can be described in a quite para llel way to Subsect. 5.2,
and based on it, we can ﬁnd a family X→PΣ≃P1, i.e., a parameter space PΣover
which we have a universal family. Here we sketch calculation s for this.
We embed the Weierstrass normal form into more general cubic s
F=a0xyz+a1y2z+a2x3+a3z3+a4xz2+a5x2z+a6yz2
inP2with(a0,a1,...,a6) = (0,1,−4,g3,g2,0,0). We associate to the Newton poly-

morphism. It is straightforward to ﬁnd that Gis generated by
(x,y,z)/ma√s⊔o→(x,y+c1x,z); (x,y,z)/ma√s⊔o→(x,y+c2z,z); (x,y,z)/ma√s⊔o→(x+c3z,y,z).
32As in the text, a preferred form Ftoric(a)for the period integral (cf. (5.6)) is given
bya4=a5=a6= 0, since in this form it is easy to ﬁnd the Picard-Fuchs equatio n

4.
D.2.τBCOVfor the family X→P1.As shown in (D.2), the family degenerates
isomorphically at x= 0and432x−1 = 0 . In fact, it is easy to verify that the
Picard-Fuchs equation (D.1) is invariant under changing va riable byx=1
432−u.
Respecting this symmetry and also imposing the regularity a t the orbifold point
x=∞, we determine τBCOVof this family by
(D.4) τBCOV=/parenleftbigg1
w0(x)/parenrightbigg3dx

Here the power of/parenleftBig

w0(x)/parenrightBig3
is determined from the BCOV formula (1.3) by setting
h1,1
X= 0andχ= 0.
D.3.Monodromy group GE.Starting from {Ftoric(a)}a∈(C∗)4, we obtain a uni-
versal family XoverP∆=P1, while from the Weierstrass normal form, we only
come to a coarse moduli space P1(2,3)≃P1which is isomorphic to H+/PSL(2,Z).
We can see the diﬀerence in the monodromy group GEof the family X→P1. Here
we brieﬂy summarize calculations of GE.
As an integral basis of the Picard-Fuchs equation, we take
I1(x) =1
2πiw0(x) logx+w1(x), I0(x) =w0(x),
wherew0(x)is the power series solution around x= 0above, and w1(x)is a power
series of the form w1(x) =cx+O(x2). Arranging these solutions to a column vector
t(I1(x)I0(x)), it is straightforward to obtain the monodromy matrices aro undx=
0,1
432and∞, respectively, as
M0=/parenleftbigg1 1
0 1/parenrightbigg
,M1=/parenleftbigg1 0
−1 1/parenrightbigg
,M∞=/parenleftbigg1−1
1 0/parenrightbigg
.
33From these, we obtain PGE=/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔TS,T/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔wherePSL(2,Z) =/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔S,T/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔withS=/parenleftbig0−1
1 0/parenrightbig
,T= (1 1
0 1), and we see that PGE=/a\}bracke⊔le{⊔S,PSL(2,Z)/a\}bracke⊔ri}h⊔. From the last rela-
tion, we see that the fundamental domain of PGEis given by
FE=F ∪(S·F),
whereFrepresents the standard fundamental domain of PSL(2,Z).
D.4.Connection matrix C[0,1].It is clear that Sacts onFEinvolutively, ex-
changing the two cusp points. Period map P:P1→H+deﬁned byτ(x) =I1(x)
I0(x)is
multi-valued. We can ﬁx the branch of this map to have an isomo rphismP1≃ FE,
whose inverse map gives the mirror map x=x(τ). TheS-transformS∗τofτ∈ FE
is contained in FE. Correspondingly it holds that x(S∗τ) =1
432−x(τ)under the
isomorphism. We can derive the last relation as follows: Sin ce the local solutions
aroundx= 0andx=1
432have overlaps in their domains of convergence, it is easy
to obtain the following relations:
I0(x) =−iI1(1
432−x), I1(x) =iI0(1
432−x).
If we set the integral basis around u:=1
432−x= 0byt(I1(u),I0(u)), we have
C[0,1]=/parenleftbig0−i
i0/parenrightbig
=iSfor the connection matrix. Note that this result gives us
w0(x(S∗τ)) =−iI1(x(τ))
I0(x(τ))w0(x(τ)) =−iτw0(x(τ)),
which tells us the branch of the relation w0(τ) = (E4(τ))1
4, i.e.,(E4(S∗τ))1
4=
(τ4E4(τ))1
4=−iτ(E4(τ))1
4. This also determines (g2(S∗τ))3
2=−τ6(g2(τ))3
2,
which gives rise to the relation x(S∗τ) =1
432−x(τ)by (D.3).

36K3 diﬀerential operators for genus zero groups Γ0(n)+
— addendum to “BCOV cusp forms of lattice polarized K3 surfac es” —
S. Hosono and A. Kanazawa
In the paper [1], we have introduced K3 diﬀerential operators (Proposition 4.9)
for all genus zero groups of type Γ0(n)+. About the genus zero groups, all details
including historical backgrounds can be found in the refere nce [2]. In particular,
theq-series expansions of Thompson series (up to additive const ants) are given in
Table 4 of [2]. To have an easy access to the Table 4 in [2], we sp ecify a genus zero
group of Γ0(n)+by the corresponding type, which represents a conjugary class of the
Monster group following ATLAS table [3]. For a quick view of t he correspondence,
we refer to a table in Appendix B of [1].
For each type m, we have the Thompson series which is deﬁned by
Tm(q) =1
q+0+H1(m)q+H2(m)q2+···
with the so-called head representations Hrof the Monstor group. For m, we have
the corresponding genus zero group Γ0(n)+, and K3 diﬀerential operator Dmwhose
mirror map is given by the Thompson series as
1
x(q)=Tm(q)+c0 (1)
with some constant c0. For several types m, this relation was ﬁrst discovered in [4];
and it was conjectured in general for all genus zero groups. P roposition 4.9 in [1]
gives us a complete list of K3 diﬀerential operators for genu s zero groups Γ0(n)+,
which veriﬁes partly the conjecture by Lian and Yau [4]. It is not clear, however,
whether every K3 diﬀerential operator (listed below) comes from a family of K3
surfaces or not.
In the following table, the ﬁrst column shows the type m, and the corresponding
K3 diﬀerential operator Dmis in the second column. In the third column, the
numberNLof LCSL points of Dmand the constant term c0in (1) are shown in
the form;NL
c0. We can verify that NLis equal to the number of the cusps Nc
for the corresponding group Γ0(n)+. The constant c0is not uniquely determined.
IfNL≥2,c0is determined so that Tn+cnhas an eta product except for n=
25,27,49,50,54. IfNL= 1, we tried to determine c0so that the unique power
seriesw0(x) = 1+/summationtext
nanxnhas integer coeﬃcients anat least for lower n≤20(cf.
Remark 4.9 of [1]). Almost all cases, we were able to ﬁnd such c0, but we couldn’t
ﬁnd such values of c0for some cases, which are indicated by †inc†
0.
