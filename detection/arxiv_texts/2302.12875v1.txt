In this paper, we study quantum gravity effect on the symmerg ent black hole which is derived from quadratic-
curvature gravity. To do so, we use the Klein-Gordon equatio n which is modiﬁed by generalized uncertainty
principle (GUP). After solving the ﬁeld equations, we exami ne the symmergent black hole’s tunneling and
Hawking temperature. We explore the graphs of the temperatu re through the outer horizon to check the GUP
inﬂuenced conditions of symmergent black hole stability. W e also explain how symmergent black holes behave
physically when inﬂuenced by quantum gravity. The impacts o f thermal ﬂuctuations on the thermodynamics
of a symmergent black holes spacetime are examined. We ﬁrst e valuate the model under consideration’s ther-
modynamic properties, such as its Hawking temperature, ang ular velocity, entropy, and electric potential. We
evaluate the logarithmic correction terms for entropy arou nd the equilibrium state in order to examine the im-
pacts of thermal ﬂuctuations. In the presence of these corre ction terms, we also examine the viability of the ﬁrst
law of thermodynamics. Finally, we evaluate the system’s st ability using the Hessian matrix and heat capacity.
It is determined that a stable model is generated by logarith mic corrections arising from thermal ﬂuctuations.

I. INTRODUCTION
Hawking radiation describes hypothetical particles creat ed near a black hole’s (BHs) event horizon. By combined model s
of general relativity and quantum mechanics, Hawking showe d that BHs are not actually black, because of the emission of a
nearly thermal radiation. This radiation implies BHs have t emperatures that are inversely proportional to their mass. One can
say that smaller BH is hotter. It is supposed that this radiat ion causes them to lose energy, shrink and eventually disapp ear which
causes the unsolved information lost problem. There are som e proposals to solve this information problem. One of them is
proposed by Hawking, Perry and Strominger by deﬁning new ter m in physics soft particles [ 1]. There are many ways to derive
Hawking radiation and calculate its temperature. The most p opular one is the the semi-classical quantum tunneling stra tegy
introduced in [ 2]. In the tunneling phenomenon, there are two famous techniq ues to derive the tunneling rates. One is Parikh-
Wilczek technique that consider the null geodesic equation of the radiated vector particles [ 3]. The other way is Hamilton-Jacobi
approach proposed in literature [ 4–29]. The tunneling probability can be derived [ 30] from the following formula
Γ≃exp/bracketleftbigg
−2
/planckover2pi1ImI/bracketrightbigg
, (1)
The Hawking temperature for all types of particles can be cal culated by using the above tunneling formula. In various typ es of
theories of quantum gravity (e.g., non-commutative geomet ry, loop quantum gravity and string theory), the main featur e is the
presence of a minimal noticeable length [ 31,32]. In order to study this minimal length, the generalized Unc ertainty Principle
(GUP) is the most appropriate way [ 33]. The modiﬁed commutation relationship is deﬁned as

Mp2andMpdenotes the Planck’s
mass. The GUP association is very helpful to understand the B H physics and the quantum effects have a great inﬂuence near t he
horizon of a BH. Gecim and Sucu [ 34–36] have studied the gravity effects incorporating GUP for 2 + 1 -dimensional Warped-
AdS3, Martinez-Zanelli and New-Type of BHs. ¨Ovg¨ un et al. [ 37–39] have investigated the gravity impacts via GUP in the
background of tunneling method for the noncommutative Reis sner-Nordstr¨ om, warped DGP gravity and 5D Myers-Perry BHs
and derived the temperature for corresponding BHs. Moreove r, the BH thermodynamics plays a very signiﬁcant role in orde r
to study the BH physics. The four laws of thermodynamics of BH and their relation with gravity have been investigated by
Bardeen and his fellows [ 40]. In order to study the thermodynamics of BH, one associates entropy with Bekensteins area
whereas the temperature can be calculated through ﬁrst law o f thermodynamics [ 41,42]. Many important features of BH e.g.,
stable and unstable form, holographic duality, criticalit y and many numerous critical perspective can be studied thro ugh corrected
thermodynamics of BH. In order to study the physics of BHs, th e quantum corrected ﬂuctuations in BH thermodynamics have
acquired a noteworthy place. Pourhassan et al [ 43–45] have computed the logarithmic correction impacts of therm al ﬂuctuations
for a charged anti-de Sitter BH, Horava-Lifshitz BH and Kerr -AdS BH. Faizal and Khalil [ 46] have investigated the GUP
corrected entropy corrections for Reissner-Nordstr¨ om, K err, charged AdS BHs as well as rotating BHs. They have also an alyzed
their remnant. The logarithmic corrected entropy has been i nvestigated for Godel BH as well as by using Cardy formula [ 47,48].
Considering 1st-order corrections to temperature and entropy of Kerr-Newm an-anti-de Sitter BHs and Reissner-Nordstrom-
anti-de Sitter BH impacts from the corrected temperature an d entropy on thermodynamical quantities like enthalpy, int ernal
energy, Gibbs free energy and Helmholtz energy have been exa mined [ 49]. Thermal ﬂuctuations’ effects on modiﬁed Hayward
BHs thermodynamics have been investigated. It has been dete rmined [ 50] how these correction terms for the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics will affect thermodynamic properties such as inner energy, entropy, pressure, and speciﬁc heat [ 51].
The motivations of our study is to analyze the Hawking temper ature under the impacts of quantum gravity as well as logarit h-
mic corrections via thermodynamics of symmergent BH. Symme rgent black hole is derived from a quadratic-curvature grav ity
which is a subclass of f(R)gravity theories [ 52–56]. To compute rate of probability and the corresponding Hawk ing temper-
ature, we utilize the Hamilton-Jacobi strategy associated with generalized Proca equation for boson radiated particl es. After
computing the corrected temperature, we graphically discu ss the stable states of symmergent BH. Moreover, by utilizin g the
thermal ﬂuctuations, we study the logarithmic corrections and their graphical interpretation.
The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. In S ection II, we brieﬂy review the symmergent BHs. In Section II I,
we compute the corrected temperature of symmergent BH by uti lizing the tunneling approach. Section IV , explains the phy sical
signiﬁcance and stable states of symmergent BH in the backgr ound of graphical representation of corrected temperature with
horizon. In Section V , we investigates the logarithmic corr ections under thermal ﬂuctuations with the help of graphs. W e
conclude our ﬁndings in Section VI.
II. SYMMERGENT BLACK HOLE
In general, the symmergent gravity is a gravity theory that r elates withR+R2theory and it is associated with f(R)gravity
theories as a special case. The complete details about symme rgent gravity theory can be studied in [ 52–54]. The solution of
symmergent black hole was found by C ¸ imdiker, ¨Ovg¨ un and Demir in [ 55] . Afterwards, the implications of this theory has been
investigated in [ 56,57] for black features e.g., weak lensing, shadow radius, quas i-periodic and oscillations. The spacetime
metric for the symmergent black hole is given by [ 55]

in whichnB/nFare for the total number of bosons/fermions in the underlyin g QFT. The above metric function reaches to the
Schwarzschild BH space-time when ˆα→1orco→ ∞ . The radius of event horizon for the symmergent BH is calcula ted by
usinggrr= 0. In that case we get three horizons but the largest root of eve nt horizon can be calculated as [ 55]

III. PARTICLE TUNNEL FROM THE SYMMERGENT BLACK HOLE
We calculate the tunneling rate of the boson particles to inv estigate the Hawking temperature of a symmergent BH. By usin g
a semi-classical technique, we describe the Hawking temper ature. Ali et al. [ 60–65] have investigated the gravity impacts via
GUP in the background of tunneling method for the BHs, cosmic strings and 5D black rings and derived the temperature for
corresponding BHs. We examine how quantum gravity affects t he Hawking temperature in the inﬂuence of GUP. According
to [66], the gravity parameter and the BH stability feature are gen erally connected. The GUP component of the Lagrangian
equation’s physical importance is taken into consideratio n. The ﬁeld equation without a singularity extended in the fo rm of
Lagrangian ﬁeld equation is the GUP parameter. In order to st udy the boson radiation phenomena, we utilize the Lagrangia n
equation of action via vector ﬁeld Ψmu.

As we can see, the quantum corrections and the BH geometry bot h have an impact on the corrected Hawking temperature.
The zero order correction term is the same as the semi-classi cal original Hawking term, but the ﬁrst-order correction te rm
must be smaller than the preceding term while still satisfyi ng GUP. The T′
Hdepends on the BH mass M, arbitrary parameter
Ξ,ˆα, symmergent gravity parameter G, loop parameter coand correction parameter β. Moreover, after neglecting the gravity
parameterβ= 0into equation ( 22), we recover the original temperature of symmergent BH in [ 55].

increases with varying mass. The T′

It can be seen that, the T′
Hincreases with increasing values of Mwith positive temperature. This positive conduct of temper ature
states the stable condition of BH. The T′

deceleration in temperature can be observed for negative va lues ofco<0as compared to positive values of co>0.
V . THERMAL FLUCTUATIONS
In order to explore the impact of thermal ﬂuctuations [ 68], several thermodynamical potentials of the rotating BTZ B Hs
have been determined, and the Hawking temperature and corre cted entropy are known. In this regard, the system’s leading -
order corrected enthalpy energy for small BHs takes on an asy mptotic value that corresponds to the correction parameter . They
discovered a critical threshold below which the effects of t hermal ﬂuctuation are negligible and the logarithmic entro py correction
for BTZ like BH, hairy BHs, Schwarzschild BH and Reissner-No rdstrom BH have been studied [ 69–71]. The study of BH
thermodynamics is greatly inﬂuenced by thermal ﬂuctuation s. The idea of Euclidean quantum gravity causes a shift in the
temporal coordinates in favor of complex plans. The partiti on functionZ(µ)in terms of density of states η(E)is provided [ 72]
as a way to verify the corrected entropy along these thermal ﬂ uctuations [ 73,74]
Z(ξ) =/integraldisplay∞
0exp(−ξE)η(E)dE, (23)
whereT+=1
ξand E is the thermal radiation’s average energy. The equatio n of density forms under the Laplace inverse

ξ0−i∞Z(ξ)exp(ξE)dξ=1
2πi/integraldisplayξ0+i∞
ξ0−i∞exp(˜S(ξ))dξ, (24)
where˜S(ξ) =ξE+lnZ(ξ)is known as the corrected entropy of the considered system. U nder the steepest decent method, the
equation of corrected entropy takes the the following form [ 75,76]
˜S(ξ) =S+1
2(ξ−ξ0)2∂2˜S(ξ)

By using the conditions∂˜S
∂ξ= 0and∂2˜S
∂ξ2>0, the corrected entropy relation under the ﬁrst-order corre ctions has been modiﬁed
[72] and by neglecting the higher order terms, the exact express ion of entropy is expressed as [ 43]
˜S=S−ψln(ST2), (26)
whereψrepresents the logarithmic correction parameter. Pourhas san and Faizal have analyzed the effects of thermal ﬂuctuati ons
on a charged AdS black hole by introducing, for the ﬁrst time, the corrected form of entropy in literature [ 43]. Then using the

From Fig. 3 , the behaviour of corrected entropy along cois monotonically increasing. It is noted that for the graph o f usual
entropy shows increasing behaviour for small values of co, so these logarithmic corrections are more useful for small BHs.
With the help of corrected entropy, we can also check behavio ur of other thermodynamic quantities in the inﬂuence of thes e

Figure 9: Speciﬁc heat with respect to coforˆa= 10 andM= 1 =G.
Fig. 9 shows the behavior of speciﬁc heat with respect to co. It is clear that whereas the uncorrected quantity (black) r epresents
the speciﬁc heat lower than zero, indicating that the system is unstable, the corrected speciﬁc heat exhibits positive b ehavior
across the whole examined area. This plot’s positivity iden tiﬁes the region of stability. It is evident that the system i s stable
under the inﬂuence of these corrections.
VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this article, we have computed the corrected Hawking temp erature for symmergent BH under the inﬂuence of GUP parame-
ter. At ﬁrst, we have studied about the metric of an exact sphe rically symmetric BH in the background of an symmergent grav ity
known as symmergent gravity. The gravity theory develops fr om quantum loops of the fundamental quantum ﬁeld theory with
the symmergent gravity constant Gand the loop parameter co. In order to study the quantum corrected temperature for sym -
mergent BH, we have used the semi-classical approach, WKB ap proximation and modiﬁed wave equation for spin- 1particles
in the background of GUP. After accompanying the WKB approxi mation into modiﬁed wave equation, we have attained a set
of ﬁeld equations, and by considering the separation of vari ables strategy, we have derived a matrix of order four by four and
after putting the determinant of the matrix equals to zero, w e have calculated a non-trivial solution as an imaginary par t of the
particle action of bosons. We have investigated the tunneli ng probability and modiﬁed temperature for the symmergent B H at
horizonr+by using the Boltzmann factor TB= exp/bracketleftBig
ˆE/T′
H/bracketrightBig
. It has worth to mention here that the both self-gravitation al and
back-reaction effects of the spin- 1particles on this symmergent BH have been neglected and the T′
Hhave been computed as a
leading term. The T′
Hdepends on the BH mass M, arbitrary parameter Ξ,ˆα, symmergent gravity parameter G, loop parameter
coand correction parameter β. Moreover, after neglecting the gravity parameter β= 0 into equation ( 22), we recover the
original temperature for symmergent BH in [ 55].
In order to analyze the gravity effects on the symmergent BH, we have studied the graphical analysis of the corrected Hawk ing
temperature versus mass Mand loop parameter cOunder the effects of various parameters. We have graphicall y investigated
the physical state and stability of BH under the inﬂuence of a rbitrary parameter ˆα, and quantum gravity parameter β. It can
be observed that the temperature exponentially increases w ith varying mass in the region 0≤M≤10. TheT′
Hdecreases
with increasing values of correction parameter β. So, we conclude that quantum corrections cause a reduction in the rise of
temperature. Moreover, we have analyzed the conduct of T′
HversusMfor various values of arbitrary parameter ˆa. TheT′
H
increases with increasing values of Mwith positive temperature. The positive conduct of tempera ture states the stable condition
of BH. TheT′
Hincreases with the increasing values of parameter ˆα.
We have depicted the graphical analysis of T′
Hviacoin the range −1≤co≤1for changing values of correction parameter
β. Forco<0, we have observed the behavior of temperature when total num ber of fermions are larger than a total number of
bosons while for co>0, we have observed the behavior of temperature when the total number of bosons are larger than a total
number of fermions. It is also observed that the T′
Hdecreases for increasing values of βin the region co<0whereas it increases
for increasing values of βin the region co>0.
Furthermore, we have analyzed the conduct of T′
Hversuscofor different values of ˆα. It can be observed that for ˆα >1and
cO<0, the temperature shows negative behavior while for ˆα >1andcO>0, the temperature shows positive decreasing
behavior. This type of conduct depicts the physical and stab le form of BH. It has also worth to mention here that, a deceler ation
in temperature can be observed for negative values of co<0as compared to positive values of co>0.11
