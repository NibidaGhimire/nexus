Sequential weak measurements allow for the direct extraction of individual density-matrix ele-
ments, rather than relying on global reconstruction of the entire density matrix, which opens a
new avenue for the characterization of quantum systems. Nevertheless, extending the sequential
scheme to multi-qudit quantum systems is challenging due to the requirement of multiple coupling
processes for each qudit and the lack of appropriate precision evaluation. To address these issues, we
propose a resource-efficient scheme (RES) that directly characterizes the density matrix of general
multi-qudit systems while optimizing measurements and establishing a feasible estimation analysis.
In the RES, an efficient observable of the quantum system is constructed such that a single meter
state coupled to each qudit is sufficient to extract the corresponding density-matrix element. An
appropriate model based on the statistical distribution of errors is utilized to evaluate the precision
and feasibility of the scheme. We have experimentally applied the RES to the direct character-
ization of general single-photon qutrit states and two-photon entangled states. The results show
that the RES outperforms sequential schemes in terms of efficiency and precision in both weak- and
strong-coupling scenarios. This work sheds new light on the practical characterization of large-scale
quantum systems and the investigation of their non-classical properties.
Introduction. –The density matrix provides a compre-
hensive description of a quantum system (QS), encom-
passing its intrinsic properties and interactions with
other systems. Accurate characterization of the density
matrix, particularly its off-diagonal elements, is crucial
for revealing the non-classical properties of quantum sys-
tems [1–3] and underpinning advanced quantum tech-
nologies [4–7]. Quantum state tomography (QST) is a
standard approach to globally reconstruct the whole den-
sity matrix based on the informationally-complete mea-
surement results. However, the experimental challenges
involved in implementing quantum measurements and
the computational complexity of the reconstruction al-
gorithm significantly increase with the size of the QS,
rendering QST impractical for characterizing large-scale
quantum states. Despite many efforts to improve the
feasibility of QST [8–12], characterizing the entire den-
sity matrix would be inefficient when only a few specific
density-matrix elements are necessary to reveal certain
properties, such as entanglement [13] and coherence [14].
In recent years, weak measurement followed by post-
selection has enabled the direct measurement of quantum
wavefunctions for pure states [15–21], as well as quasi-probability distributions of general mixed states [22–25],
which are equivalent to the density matrix through linear
transformations [26]. Particularly, the density-matrix el-
ements can be directly characterized through sequential
measurements of complementary observables [22, 27–29].
Given the substantial benefits of reducing the number of
measurement bases and avoiding the reconstruction al-
gorithm, the direct-characterization schemes have been
extended to quantum processes [30] and quantum detec-
tors [31, 32]. However, the direct characterization of the
density matrix relies on sequential coupling processes for
each qudit of the QS, which limits its efficiency and scal-
ability for multi-particle and high-dimensional quantum
states [33]. Currently, the direct characterization of high-
dimensional or two-photon density matrix typically re-
quires introducing certain assumptions or utilizing extra
resources [34, 35]. Moreover, extracting high-order corre-
lation information during sequential weak measurements
results in large statistical errors [36, 37]. To improve the
precision of the direct characterization, a rigorous frame-
work based on strong measurements has been developed
[38–41]. However, this approach may destroy the unique
advantages of weak measurement in slightly disturbingarXiv:2303.06903v2  [quant-ph]  14 Jul 20242

In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient scheme
(RES) to directly characterize the density-matrix ele-
ments of general multi-qudit quantum systems. In the
RES, an efficient observable is constructed through the
Hadamard transformation, which enables to extract the
density-matrix element of interest with a single coupling
process for each qudit. We experimentally demonstrate
the RES by directly characterizing the density matrix
of single-photon qutrit states and two-photon entangled
states during the unitary evolution and dephasing pro-
cesses. Our results show that the RES achieves bet-
ter precision than sequential schemes with fewer quan-
tum measurements, irrespective of whether the coupling
strength is weak or optimized in terms of precision.
Theoretical framework. –We begin by considering a gen-
eral single-qudit state described by a d-dimensional den-
sity matrix ρ=P
a,a′ρa,a′|a⟩⟨a′|. To directly character-
ize the off-diagonal element ρa,a′(a̸=a′), we associate it
with the average value Tr( ˆMa′,aρ) =ρa,a′of the operator
ˆMa′,a=dˆπa′ˆπbˆπa, where ˆ πb=|b⟩⟨b|and|b⟩=1√
dP
a|a⟩.
Typically, the observables ˆ πaand ˆπbare sequentially
measured using two independent meter states, followed
by the post-selection projector ˆ πa′[22, 27, 29, 40]. Joint
measurements on the post-selected meter states lead to
the average value Tr( ˆMa′,aρ). Alternatively, we can de-
compose ˆMa′,a= ˆπa′ˆCa,a′into the product of an efficient
observable ˆCa,a′=|a⟩⟨a′|+|a′⟩⟨a|+P
k̸=a,k̸=a′|k⟩⟨k|and
the post-selection projector ˆ πa′. Consequently, by mea-
suring the efficient observable, we can directly charac-
terize the density-matrix element with only one coupling
process for each qudit.
Fig. 1 (A) depicts the RES for directly character-
izing the density matrix of a single-qudit QS. Within
the red dashed box, the efficient observable ˆCa,a′is con-
structed via the Hadamard transformation ˆHa,a′on theordinary observable ˆOa′=ˆ11s−2|a′⟩⟨a′|of the QS, given
byˆCa,a′=ˆHa,a′ˆOa′ˆHa,a′. A single-qubit meter state
(MS)|0⟩mthat can be either another particle or another
degree of freedom of the same particle is coupled with the
QSρvia the Hamiltonian ˆH=G(t)ˆCa,a′⊗ˆσy, where ˆ σy
is the Pauli operator of the MS. We define the coupling
strength as g=R
G(t)dtwith G(t) a compact support
around the time of coupling. After the coupling process
ˆU= exp( −iRˆHdt), the system-meter joint state evolves
toρjt=ˆUρ⊗ |0⟩m⟨0|ˆU†. Given a pair of post-selection
projectors ˆ πa′and ˆπacorresponding to the conjugate op-
erators ˆMa′,aand ˆMa,a′, we perform both post-selection
on the QS and measure the observables ˆ σ+= ˆσx+iˆσy
and ˆσ−= ˆσx−iˆσyof the MS to obtain the weak aver-
age Tr( ˆMa′,aρ) and the complex conjugate of Tr( ˆMa,a′ρ),
respectively. Thus, the density-matrix element can be
derived by
ρa,a′=1

(ˆΠa′,++ˆΠa,−)ρjt
, (1)
where ˆΠa′,+= ˆπa′⊗ˆσ+andˆΠa,−= ˆπa⊗ˆσ−denote the
joint observables of the QS and the MS.
In Fig. 1 (B), our formalism is extended to
the direct characterization of N-qudit density ma-
trix ρ(N)=P
S,S′ρ(N)
S,S′|S⟩⟨S′|, where |S⟩⟨S′|=
|a1, ..., a N⟩⟨a′
1, ..., a′
N|and|an⟩represents the eigenstate
of the nth qudit. To directly characterize the off-diagonal
element ρS,S′, we decompose the operator ˆMS′,S=
|S′⟩⟨S|(or its conjugate ˆMS,S′) into the product of the
joint efficient observable ˆC(N)=⊗N
n=1ˆCnand the post-
selection projector ˆΠ(N)
S′=|S′⟩⟨S′|(ˆΠ(N)
S). The effi-
cient observable ˆCnfor the nth qudit is divided into
the following two cases: (i) if aj̸=a′
j, we choose
ˆCj=|aj⟩⟨a′
j|+|a′
j⟩⟨aj|+P
kj̸=aj,kj̸=a′
j|kj⟩⟨kj|, and the
coupling process is analogous to that in the single-qudit
situation; (ii) if ak=a′
k,ˆCkis equal to ˆ11s,k, and no
coupling is required. The separate measurement of the
efficient observable ˆCjon each qudit with the identical
coupling strength gis implemented by the Hamiltonian
ˆH(N)=G(t)P
aj̸=a′
jˆCj⊗ˆσy,j. Assuming that there are
totally lindependent couplings in the N-qudit system, we
get the joint state ρ(N)
jt=ˆU(N)h
ρ(N)⊗(|0⟩m⟨0|)⊗li
ˆU(N)†
with the unitary operator ˆU(N)= exp[ −iRˆH(N)dt]. The
direct product of the post-selection operator ˆΠS′(ˆΠS)
and the observable ⊗l
j=1ˆσ+,j(⊗l

(PPKTP) crystal inside a Sagnac interferometer for spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) to prepare heralded

Given that the quantum states are uniformly sampled
over the state space, the statistical properties of errors
provide an insight into the expected precision and fea-
sibility of the scheme. Specifically, the arbitrary qudit
state ρd=ˆV|0⟩⟨0|ˆV†is sampled by evolving the initial
state|0⟩⟨0|= (1,0, ...,0)T(1,0, ...,0) under the unitary
operator ˆV∈ˆU(d). We denote the variances of the real
and imaginary parts of ρa,a′(a̸=a′) asδ2Re(ρa,a′) and
δ2Im(ρa,a′), respectively. With the Haar measure µd(ˆV),
the variance δ2Re(ρa,a′) orδ2Im(ρa,a′) for any a̸=a′can
be equivalently represented by δ2

matrix element, i.e., δ2Re[ρ(N)

Experiment. –In order to demonstrate the feasibility of
the RES, we experimentally apply it to the direct char-
acterization of several typical photonic quantum states.
The experimental setup for the preparation and direct
characterization of single-qutrit states ρTis shown in Fig.
2 (B). Heralded single photons generated in module (A)
input S1 port and subsequently pass through a half-wave
plate (HWP), a quarter-wave plate (QWP), and a polar-
izer to initialize the polarization to the horizontal state
|H⟩. We employ two HWPs positioned at angles of θ1
andθ2, respectively, for polarization rotation. The rela-
tive phases ϕ1andϕ2between the horizontal and verti-
cal polarization are adjusted by a liquid-crystal variable
retarder (LCVR, Thorlabs LCC1423-B) and a QWP-
HWP-QWP combination, respectively. The polarizing
beam displacers (PBDs) implement beam splitting by
transmitting (refracting) photons in |V⟩(|H⟩). With the
optical paths {up,middle ,bottom }corresponding to the
basis{|0⟩,|1⟩,|2⟩}, we prepare an arbitrary pure qutrit
state|ψT⟩= cos 2 θ1cos 2θ2|0⟩+ cos 2 θ1sin 2θ2eiϕ2|1⟩+
sin 2θ1ei(ϕ1+ϕ2)|2⟩[42]. Mixed qutrit states are obtained
by probabilistically mixing specific pure states [42].
We realize the Hadamard transformations “ ˆH0,1”,
“ˆH1,2” and “ ˆH0,2” on the qutrit states with three steps:
(i) the first three HWPs and the following PBD transform
the path-encoded information to the polarization; (ii) the
middle three HWPs perform the Hadamard transforma-
tion on the polarization; (iii) the last three HWPs recover
the polarization of photons at all paths to |H⟩, initializ-4

the detectors D1, D2 and D3, corresponding to the suc-
cessful post-selection by the operators ˆ π0, ˆπ1and ˆπ2, re-
spectively.
As shown in Fig. 2 (C), two-photon entangled states
ρEare directly characterized by separately inputting two
photons into S1 and S2 ports, respectively. Both pho-
tons undergo identical setups illustrated in the dotted
box labeled “(M)” with the specific configurations de-
pending on the density-matrix element of interest. We
refer to the polarization degree of freedom of photons as
the QS. Photons first get through a QWP-QWP-HWP
combination for compensating the polarization changes
in fiber transmission [43]. Then, we implement an ar-
bitrary unitary transformation ˆU1(2) on the QS with a
QWP-HWP-QWP combination [44, 45]. The subsequent
HWP (as well as the last HWP) at 22 .5◦implements
the Hadamard transformation on the polarization qubit.
To facilitate the coupling between the QS and the MS,
we transform the polarization information of photons to
the path information through a PBD and the polariza-
tion of photons at both paths is initialized to |H⟩as the
MS. The coupling operation and MMS are analogous to
the single-qutrit experiment. We capture the coinciden-
tal counts by detecting the simultaneous arrival of two
photons at specific pairs of detectors including D4&D6,
D4&D7, D5&D6 and D5&D7 to realize the post-selection
operators ˆΠ(2)

Results. –In Fig. 3 (A), we depict the experimental
results of directly characterizing the density-matrix el-
ements of qutrit states during the unitary process by set-
ting the parameters θ1= arcsin(p
1/3)/2,θ2=π/8,
ϕ1=ϕ2+π/3 and varying ϕ2from π/3 to 4 π/3. Fur-
thermore, we select a qutrit state ρT,0by setting ϕ2=
2π/3 and subject it to a dephasing process N(|a⟩⟨a′|) =5
γT|a⟩⟨a′|, in which the dephasing coefficient (0 ≤γT≤1
is adjusted by mixing specific pure states with differ-
ent probabilities [42]. The measured results of the de-
creased off-diagonal elements γT⟨a|ρT,0|a′⟩are shown in
Fig. 3 (B). To directly characterize two-qubit systems, we
evolve one of the Bell states |ψb⟩= (|H⟩|V⟩+|V⟩|H⟩)/√

cos 2θne−iϕn1−sin 2θneiϕn2

to prepare the sampling
state|ψE⟩=ˆU1(2)⊗ˆU2(2)|ψb⟩and its density matrix
ρE=|ψE⟩⟨ψE|. By setting the parameters θ11=π/8,
θ21=ϕ21=ϕ22= 0, ϕ12=ϕ11+π/4 and vary-
ingϕ11from 0 to π, we illustrate the completely off-
diagonal density-matrix elements, i.e., ⟨00|ρE|11⟩and
⟨01|ρE|10⟩, in Fig. 3 (C). Next, an original state ρE,0=
|ψE,0⟩⟨ψE,0|with ϕ11=π/3 undergoes a dephasing pro-
cessN(|S⟩⟨S′|) =γE|S⟩⟨S′|with the coefficient γEad-
justed by appropriately mixing certain unitary operators
ˆU1(2) and ˆU2(2) [42]. The experimental completely off-
diagonal density-matrix elements of ρEduring the de-
phasing process are shown in Fig. 3 (D).
In Fig. 4, we compare the precision of the RES and se-
quential schemes with different coupling strength g. Pro-
vided that the total number of single photons or photon
pairs per unit time follows a Poisson distribution with
an average value of nt, the mean characterization preci-
sion that is achieved with a single copy of single-qutrit
and two-qubit states are theoretically derived as nt∆2
T
andnt∆2
E, respectively [42]. In the experiment, we ran-
domly prepare 100 single-qutrit states |ψT⟩=ˆU(3)|0⟩or
two-photon polarization states |ψE⟩=ˆU1(2)⊗ˆU2(2)|ψb⟩
with the unitary operators ˆU(3),ˆU1(2) and ˆU2(2) sam-
pled according to the Haar measure. The experimen-
tal precision is obtained from Monte Carlo simulation
based on raw data. The results show that the preci-
sion of both direct-characterization schemes is improved
with stronger coupling strength g. The optimal preci-
sion of the RES in characterizing both single-qutrit states
(g=π/4,nt∆2
T= 0.125) and two-qubit states ( g=π/4,
nt∆2
E= 0.208) is overall better than that of sequen-
tial schemes with single-qutrit states ( g=π/2,nt∆2
T=
0.708) and two-qubit states ( g=π/2,nt∆2
E= 0.458).
Discussion and conclusions. –The insets (a) to (d) of
Fig. 4 show non-divergent statistical errors, which con-
firms the feasibility of our scheme for characterizing ar-
bitrary quantum states. In weak-measurement scenario
(i.e., g→0), the precision of the RES is significantly bet-
ter than that of sequential schemes with a ratio follow-
ingg2NforN-qudit systems. This advantage makes our
scheme more suitable for studying weak-measurement
problems, such as the share of non-locality [46], the error-
disturbance relationship [47], and so on [48, 49]. With
qubit meter states used for the direct characterization
ofN-qudit systems, the resource-efficient or sequential
schemes typically perform 22Nor 23Nprojective mea-surements, respectively. When the efficiency of direct
characterization schemes is compared quantitatively by
counting the total number of photons (or equivalent time
consumption) required to achieve the same precision, the
mean efficiency of the optimal RES is 11.3 or 8.8 times
higher than that of the optimized sequential schemes for
single-qutrit states or two-qubit states, respectively.
In conclusion, we have proposed a resource-efficient
scheme (RES) that can be used to directly character-
ize the density matrix of general multi-qudit quantum
systems. Compared to sequential schemes, the RES only
requires one coupling process for each qudit to extract
the arbitrary density-matrix element of interest through
an efficient observable. We experimentally demonstrate
the advantages of the RES over sequential schemes by
directly characterizing qutrit and two-qubit states with
fewer measurements and better precision. These advan-
tages are significantly enhanced as the particle number
increases in weak coupling scenarios. Even when both the
resource-efficient and sequential schemes are optimized in
terms of precision over the coupling strength, the former
still demonstrates an approximately tenfold efficiency ad-
vantage over the latter. Our work provides a promis-
ing approach for the characterization and exploration of
large-scale quantum systems, with broad extensions from
integrated photonic chip to other physical systems.
