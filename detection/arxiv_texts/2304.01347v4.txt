Abstract —The available evidence suggests that dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) can capture time -varying 
abnormalities in brain activity in resting -state c erebral functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs -fMRI) data and has a 
natural advantage in uncovering mechanisms of abnormal brain activity in schizophrenia (SZ) patients. Hence, an advanced 
dynamic brain network analysis model called the temporal brain category graph convolutional network (Temporal -BCGC N) 
was employed. Firstly, a unique dynamic brain network analysis module, DSF -BrainNet, was designed to construct 
dynamic synchronization features. Subsequently, a revolutionary graph convolution method, TemporalConv, was 
proposed, based on the synchronous  temporal properties of feature. Finally, the first modular abnormal hemispherical 
lateralization test tool in deep learning based on rs -fMRI data, named CategoryPool, was proposed.  This study was 
validated on COBRE and UCLA  datasets and achieved 83.62% an d 89.71% average accuracies, respectively, outperforming 
the baseline model and other state -of-the-art methods. The ablation results also demonstrate the advantages of 
TemporalConv over the traditional edge feature graph convolution approach and the improv ement of CategoryPool over 
the classical graph pooling approach. Interestingly, this stud y showed that the lower order perceptual system and higher 
order network regions in the left hemisphere are more severely dysfunctional than in the right hemisphere in SZ and 
reaffirms the importance of the left medial superior frontal gyrus  in SZ. Our core code is available at:

I. INTRODUCTION  
urrently, artificial intelligence methods that assist in diagnosing  schizophrenia (SZ) and investigating  hemispherical  
lateralization abnormalities are critical research topics in the field of clinical medicine for psychiatric disorders. Severe  
behavioral dysfunction is common among SZ patients , and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 1% [1] and a shorter life 
expect ancy of approximately 15 years compared with the general population [2]. Concurrently, the diagnosis and treatment of SZ 
are arduous because a wide range of brain dysfunctions, in perception, thinking, emotion, and behavior, is involved. Resting -state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (resting -state cerebral functional magnetic resonance imaging,  rs-fMRI) [3], is a non -
invasive medical imaging technique that measures fluctuations of blood oxygen level (BOLD) signals in various regions of inte rest 
(ROI) of the brain. rs -fMRI has been used to study abnormal functional connectivity patterns in SZ patients [4,5,6] . Although these 
studies have used computerized methods to analyze rs -fMRI data, there remains room to develop new computer -assisted diagnostic 
techniques for mental disorders and improve the usefulness of old methods . For example, making full use of rs -fMRI data to 
construct complex brain networks, improving feature extraction from the networks, and further investigating potential lateral ization 
abnormalities in the patient's brain.  
The size and complexity of brain network topologies pose challenges to understanding higher cognitive abnormalities in patien ts 
with psychiatric illnesses.  Existing studies have shown that brain activity is always in a dynamic pattern of neural activity , and it 
is believed that dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis can reveal temp oral dynamics changes masked by static functional 
connectivity (sFC) [7, 8]. Therefore, the use of dFC to describe the state of brain network activity has become a research hotspot 
in complementary diagnosis and analysis of psychiatric disorders [9, 10, 11]. The dFC analysis  uses a sliding window to slic e the 
rs-fMRI data into multiple time segments, providing a new way to explore the d ynamic mechanisms of brain activity further. Lin 
et al.  [12] proposed a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for extracting high -level features of the dFC network and

implement classification. Ramirez -Mahaluf et al.  [13] found a temporal disorgani zation  of dFC in the brains of patients with first -
episode psychosis. Most studies have explored the dynamic patterns of change in brain networks using the dFC mechanism s but 
have not fully mined the implied synchronization trends between brain regions.  
Graph neural networks (GNNs) extend deep learning (DL) methods to non -Euclidean domains to extract and aggregate feature 
information in graph -structured data  more effectively , showing superior performance in the field of SZ -assisted diagnosis. Lei et 
al. [14] used a graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract features from rs -fMRI data to reveal abstract and complex 
relationships within brain networks and identify topological abnormalities in the functional networks of SZ patients. Chang et 
al.[15] applied a  GNN to learn the topology of brain networks in the source space to better capture the complex relationships 
involved in the mismatch negative disorder mechanism in the electroencephalography of SZ patients. In this study, we found th at 
most of the edge ve ctor graph  convolution methods, represented by Edge -Conditioned  Convolution (ECConv) [16], disru pt the 
temporal construction of node and edge features during the convolution of traditional GNNs when applied to brain time series data . 
This disruption may de grade the classification performance of the model.  
Some studies  have  found that SZ patients  may have hemispheric lateralization abnormalities  [4, 17] and disruptions to the mutual 
coordination of left and right hemisphere functions  of the brain [18, 19]. Due to  the essential role of pooling operations in the 
network structure, the use of pooling to verify brain lateralization abnormalities in SZ patients  has become a topic of research 
interest . To exploit further the latent relationships among nodes, some studies clustered the nodes during pooling and then selected 
the nodes based on class clusters, where the selection was often data -driven. Yuan et al.  [20] proposed a graph pooling technique 
that assigns nodes with similar features to the same class cluste rs and uses them for the prediction task of the graph structure. 
Gopinath et al.  [21] introduced a learnable pooling strategy with a difference pooli ng technique to split the network into two 
separate paths , one for computing the latent features of nodes a nd the other for clustering the features into node class clusters. 
However, to verify the presence of abnormal lateralization in SZ patients, it is often necessary to divide the brain regions in the 
left and right hemispheres into two clusters according to  prior knowledge. Existing graph clustering pooling strategies are limited 
in this case as they cannot target potential functional abnormalities in the left and right hemispheres of SZ patients .  
To address these limitations, an advanced GCN improvement mo del based on dynamic brain network analysis , the temporal 
brain category graph convolutional network (Temporal -BCGCN), was proposed.  Firstly, the dynamic synchronous functional brain 
network (DSF -BrainNet)  with temporal dynamic synchronous properties  was b uilt using a sliding window  technique to obtain 
information about nodes in brain regions and the interrelationships between nodes. Second ly, the proposed TemporalConv enables 
the convolution process to adapt to the dynamic synchronization rule in DSF -BrainNet . Finally , the pooling strategy CategoryPool 
was employed  in the pooling layer of GCN to improve the accuracy of SZ diagnosis and  investigate further hemispheric 
lateralization abnormalities of SZ  patients .  
The main contributions of this paper can  be summarized as follows:  
1) A unique dynamic brain network analysis module, DSF -BrainNet, is proposed. DSF -BrainNet brings new perspectives for  
understanding  further the dynamic fluctuation patterns of various brain regions over time. This module was us ed as the input of 
the GCN.  
2) A revolutionary convolutional method called TemporalConv is presented . TemporalConv convolves the features of the rs-
fMRI data obtained from each time slice independently. The original concept of temporal convolution  provides  a new reference 
for subsequent researchers perform ing graph convolution on rs-fMRI and other temporal data.  
3) A novel pooling strategy called CategoryPool is proposed. In rs -fMRI research, CategoryPool is the first modular hemispheric 
lateralization abno rmalities  test tool  used for  deep learning. This method has strong generalization and can be transferred to other 
medical research fields.   
II. DATASETS  AND  PREPROCESSING  
Two datasets were selected for model evaluation in this study, the Cen ter for Bio-medical Research Excellence (COBRE) 
Dataset [22] and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Dataset [23], with the following sources and corresponding 
preprocessing.  
The COBRE Dataset was obtained from the COBRE, a free and publicly available data base at the University of New Mexico 
Biomedical Research Center. This study selecte d rs-fMRI images of 112 subjects as simulation data, including 48 SZ patients  and 
64 healthy control (HC).  Informed consent was obtained from each subject in accordance with  the University of New Mexico 
Office of Human Research Protections. The UCLA Dataset was obtained from the UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric 
Phenomics LA5c Study , which  selecte d rs-fMRI images of 80 subjects as simulation data, including 41 SZ patients and 39 HC. 
All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with procedures approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board. In 
addition, subjects with a diagnosis of a neurological disorder , mental retardation, severe head trauma, substance abuse , or 
dependence within the previous 12 and six months were excluded from the aforementioned  two datasets  respectively .  
The data were preprocessed using the DPABI toolbox [ 24] with the following main processes: 1) slice timing,  2) realignment, 
3) normalization, 4) smoothing, and 5) detrending. In this study, the brain was divided into 116 ROIs using anatomical automa tic 
labeling (AAL), and 26 ROIs in the cerebellar region were removed, resulting in 90 brain ROIs for the experime nt.  3 
 
III. METHODS  
A. Overview of Temporal -BCGCN  Architecture  
In this study, a n advanced  Temporal -BCGCN model was proposed for computer -aided diagnosis and brain function 
lateralization analysis of SZ patients . The structural framework is illustrated in Fig. 1 . 
 
Fig. 1.  Overall flowchart of the Temporal -BCGCN Architecture. (a) rs -fMRI. (b) BOLD Signal Series. (c) DSF -BrainNet. (d) TemporalConv. (e) 
CategoryPool . 
Fig. 1 (a) shows the brain’s rs -fMRI data of 
N subjects. The brain data of 
N  subjects are entered into the AAL template, and 
each subject is given the corresponding BOLD signal on  each of the 
n  ROIs to obtain the 
N  sets of dataset in (b),  where each set 
contains the BOLD signal sequence of the 
n ROIs. The horizontal coordinates of the BOLD signal  in Fig. 1 (b) represent the time 
variation, the vert ical coordinates represent the BOLD signal values, and the oscillating dashes in each color represent the specific 
BOLD signal values for each ROI at the corresponding time points.  The BOLD signal in Fig. 1 (b) is processed using a sliding 
window technique to obtain the time slice s in Fig. 1  (c), and the node features and edge features are calculated for each time slice. 
Particularly, in Fig. 1 (c), we propose the DSF -BrainNet module to construct a temporally synchronized feature brain network. First, 
we used  the sliding window  technique to divide the temporal signals of each subject into partially overlapping time slices. Then 
the signals of ROIs within each time slice were analyzed using the slide piecewise aggregation (SPA) technique to construct t he 
graph node features. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between two ROIs within each time slice were calculated to 
construct  the edge features of the graph network. Subsequently, the brain feature graphs constructed in Fig. 1 (c) were  fed into Fig. 
1(d), t he TemporalConv operation. We set up 
m  independent convolution paths according to the number of time slices, so that 
nodes and edge features under different time slices were  signaled in independent paths, ensuring that the synchronous timing 
properties in DSF -BrainNet were not destroyed during  the convolution process. In addition, the convolution module was run twice 
in succession. The aggregated feature graphs obtained in Fig. 1 (d) were then fed into Fig. 1 (e), where the left and right hemisphere 
nodes were set to Categor ies A and B, respectiv ely. After determining the total number of nodes 
  to be retaine d in the pooling, 
the corresponding abnormal propensity parameters 
A  and 
B  were set to control the proportion of node s retained in the left and 
right hemispheres, respectively. Finally, the pooled brain maps were fed into the multi -layer perceptron (MLP) to obtain the 
classification results. The optimal model values of 
A  and 
B  were determined through multiple experiments for further 
lateralization analysis.  
B. DSF-BrainNet  
 
DSF-BrainNet  is topologically composed of graph nodes and edge features. To reflect the fluctuation of brain activity over time, 
the graph nodes and edge features are organized as time   series data, and they maintain a time -based synchronization property. 
They are def ined as follows: 
( , )G V E=  denotes the undirected graph, where 
12{ , , , }n V v v v=
  denotes the set of brain region nod es, 
and 
n  denotes the number of brain region nodes, that is, the number of ROIs. Similarly, 
{( , )}ij E v v= denotes the set of edges 
between the nodes of each brain region in the graph, where
,ijv v V  ; 
Econtains 
M  elements; thus, there are 
2
n MC= edges in 
4 
 
the graph. Therefore, there exists a function relation
:mXV
  that assigns features to each node, and a function 
:mLE
  that 
assig ns features to each edge. Here, 
m  denotes the length of the node feature vector, that is, the number of time slices. Moreover, 
the above functions can be considered as matrices 
nmX
  and
MmL
 . Therefore, 
( ), 1,2, ,iX v i n =
  as the feature vector of 
node 
iv , 
()kiXv  denotes the feature component of  
()iXv  at the 
thk  time slice; 
( ) , , , , 1,2, ,k
k i j i jL v v e i j k m =  =
 , where 
,k
ije
denotes the component of the edge feature vector 
,ije  of both nodes 
,ijvv  at the 
thk  time slice, that is 
12
, , , , ,( , , , ),mm
i j i j i j i j i je e e e e=
 . 
For the convenience of follow -up, it can be straightforwardly made to define
() , ,i j i jL v v e = . 
For a brain region node 
pv , its adjacent nodes are defined as all its neighboring brain regions denoted as 
()p Ne v , that is,  
  ( ) ( , )p p q Ne v q v v E =
                                                                           (1) 
where 
qv  denotes the adjacent nodes of the brain region 
pv .

Using the SPA method, the node feature information under each time slice is constructed synchronously, (c) Using PCC, the constructed edge 
feature information under each ti me slice.  
 
In Fig. 2 , the rs -fMRI data of the 
N  subjects are shown on the leftmost side. The brain structure of each subject was divided 
into 90 ROIs using an AAL template. Thus, for each subject, the rs -fMRI data correspond to the BOLD signals of 90 ROIs. In Fig. 
2(a), the entire scan time is divided into 
m  time slices using the sliding window technique, and the acquired time slices are then 
input into Fig. 2 (b) and Fig. 2 (c). Subsequently, node and edge features are constructed for the BOLD signals within each time 
slice using  the corresponding methods. Finally, all node and edge features form a DSF -BrainNet . 
1) Sliding window  Technique  
As a classical feature acquisition method , the sliding window  technique ha s been widely applied to solve practical problems in 
various fields [ 25, 26, 27]. Therefore, in this study, sliding windows were used to construct node and edge features to exploit 
fully the temporal informati on in rs -fMRI data. Taking the rs -fMRI brain data of a subject as an example, a reasonable window 
width 
W and window step 
s  were chosen for a time series of length 
K . The entire time series was divided into 
m  time slices 
by shifting the sliding window over the time series 
K  with a given window step 
s . The starting point of each time slice was 
[0, ]t K W−
 and the ending point was 
t t W=+ . Therefore, the total number of time slices 
m  could calculated using : 
1KWms−=+
                                                                                        (2)

where  
 denotes the ceiling function.  
2) Calculation of node features using SPA method  
Because rs -fMRI is a time series consisting of multiple discrete signal points, this study extends the Piecewise Aggregation 
Approximation (PAA) method by  applying a continuous time series to the rs -fMRI discrete time series and proposes the SPA 
method. After data reduction, the rs -fMRI data were organized into graph -node features.  
Specifically, taking the rs -fMRI signal of any brain region in a subject, th e specific mathematical procedure of SPA is expressed 
as follows: In each time slice, all rs -fMRI discrete signals 
WBOLD 
 are averaged to obtain
11W
i
iBOLD= BOLDW = . In total, 
m  
BOLD signals were generated for each brain region in 
m  time slices, and nodal feature vectors were obtained by connecting them 
in time order.  
3) Calculation of edge features using PCC  
In this study, a sliding window  was used to const ruct dFC. Specifically, PCC is used to calculate the edge feature component 
,k
ije
 of the BOLD signals at each time slice for nodes 
iv  and 
jv  in the brain region, and the correlation coeff icient s at all time 
slices are arranged to form the edge feature vector 
,ije . 
To calculate the correlation coefficient 
( 1 1)rr−    for two ROIs at any time slice where th e two brain region nodes are 
iv and 
jv
, the PCC at the current time slice was calculated using Eq. ( 3):

g,

g BOLD  and

corresponding signal averages of

g BOLD  and

time series 
K  according to window  step
s , and each translation calculates a new correlation coefficient for the current time slice, 
so that a total of 
m  correlation coefficients are generated between the two brain nodes at 
m  time slices. The above 
m  Pearson 
correlation coefficients are concatenated in time to obtain the edge feature vectors 
,ije  of 
iv  and
jv , that is, the edge feature 
information data between nodes

C. TemporalConv  
Most graph convolution methods cannot  handle multi -dimensional edge feature vectors. Those that can handle them mostly 
make use of fully connected operation , i.e., transforming the dimensionality of the edge feature vectors to match the node 
dimensionalit y through a linear layer (multiple lin ear layers form an MLP in ECConv), such as in GATConv [28] and UniMPConv 
[29]. Because the fully connected approach for DSF -BrainNet destroys the tem poral synchronization between features, this study  
improve d on the traditional edge convolution approach re presented by ECConv by proposing TemporalC onv. 
 
Fig. 3.   Comparison of ECConv and TemporalConv convolution processes:  (a) Schematic diagram of DSF -BrainNet.  (b) Convolution process of 
applying ECConv to DSF -BrainNet.  (c) Convolution process of applying TemporalConv to DSF -BrainNet.

In Fig. 3 (a), the green gradient bars represent the node feature vectors and the purple gradient blocks represent the edge feature 
vectors, Fig. 3 (b) shows the use of the ECConv method for the  DSF-BrainNet constructed in this study, where 
  represents matrix 
multiplication; 
  represents element -wise addition, and 
13tt−  represents different time slices of the feature vectors (that is, 
feature dimensions). Specifically, for the target node 
1()l
i Xv−  to be convolved, ECConv inputs adjacent edge features into an MLP 
for dimension adjustment. Matrix multipli cation is performed between the adjusted matrix and the corresponding adjacent node 
feature vectors . Finally, the result is added element -wise to the self -connected target node 
1()l
i Xv−  to obtain the convolved target 
node 
()l
iXv . However, the fully connected operation in MLP and self -connection destroy the synchronous timing relationship of 
features; therefore, the ECConv method is not suitable for the data organization form of this study,  Fig. 3 (c) represents the 
appli cation of TemporalConv to the DSF -BrainNet constructed in this study, where 
  represents the element -wise product. 
Specifically, in this convolution process, each graph node in each time slice forms an independent convolution path with its 
neighboring nodes and edges to ensure that the features of the convolved graph nodes remain in temporal order. Also, unlike 
ECConv where all edge vectors share a single learnable weight in the MLP, TemporalConv sets a unique adaptive weight for ea ch 
edge feature component in each time slice to facilitate the importance of all edge feature components in all time slices. Thi s 
information transfer process is bidirectional as the nodes in the graph are neighbors of each other. The independent convolut ion 
process for each time slice is represented by the gray dashed line in the Fig. 3 . In summary, TemporalConv preserves the temporal 
synchronization of features better than ECConv in the convolution process.  
As the notation mentioned in Section III.B, it  is assumed here that 
max {0,1, , }ll   is the layer index in a feed -forward neural 
network. Then there  exists function relation  
:ld lXV
  to assign features to each graph node, and  function relation  
:ld lLE
  
to assign features to each edge, where 
ld  is the feature dimension of the nodes and edge feature vectors of the 
thl  layer of the 
neural network. Simultaneously, the above functions ca n also be regarded as matrices 
lnd lX
  and
l Md lL
 , where 
n is the 
number of nodes in the graph, and 
M  is the number of edges in the graph. Let 
  12ld , ...,      be the independent convolution 
pathway of each time slice in TemporalConv. It should be emphasized that the feature dimension of any node and edge in each 
time slice is one. Therefore, taking the 
  pathway in a time slice as an example, its convolved node feature value 
()l
i Xv  is the 
sum of two parts. The first part is 
1()l
i Xv−  under the influence of the adaptive weight 
i , and learnable b ias 
ib , and the second 
part is the sum of all adjacent edge feature values 
1()l
ji L v ,v−  of the node and the corresponding adjacent node feature values 
1()l
j Xv−
 under the influence of the adaptive weig ht 
,ijvv , where 
()jiv Ne v . Therefore, the TemporalConv calculation process 
under the 
  pathway is as follows:

D. CategoryPool  
To improve further the classification accuracy of SZ patients and analyze hemispheric lateralization abnormalities, we propos ed 
CategoryPool. As shown in Fig. 4 , this method divides the brain nodes into two categories: left and right hemispheres. After 
determining the total number of nodes 
  to be retained, the proportion of brain regions to be retained in these two categories (
A,
B
) was set to investigate the effect of different rete ntion ratios on the cl assification accuracy of SZ patients. Additionally, various 
node scoring strategies can be nested in CategoryPool pooling to filter the reserved nodes; this method mainly adopts the nod e 
scoring strategy of TopK [30]  for experimental exploration.

In Fig. 4 , the set of brain nodes

is performed. In particular, the nodes in

are regrouped back into the GCN for output. Notably,

IV. EXPERIMENTS  AND  RESULTS  
To evaluate the performance of the proposed Temporal -BCGCN classification model, and to discuss the hemispheric 
lateralization abnormalities  in SZ patients, this section is divided into three parts: 1) experimental impleme ntation and setting, 2) 
comparison experiment, and 3) ablation experiment. To verify the robustness of the models, the Temporal -BCGCN and comparison 
models were cross -validated on two cohorts 10 times with five folds, and four evaluation metrics were used to assess the 
performance of model : accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and F1 -Score.  
A. Experimental Implementation and Setting  
Temporal -BCGCN was implemented using the PyTorch geometry and trained on an NVID IA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU. In 
this study, the Adam solver [ 31] was used; the initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the epoch number to 500. The window 
width 
W and sliding step 
s  were set to divide the time series into 
m  time slices, and then the node  features and edge feature 
vectors were calculated for each time slice using the SPA and PCC methods, respectively . The final DSF -BrainNet was comprised 
of a s et of graph nodes 
V and a set of edge features
L .  
In this study, the DSF -BrainNet was fed into a GCN classifier. The classifier primarily consisted of two convolutional layers 
and one pooling layer. The feat ure dimension of the convolutional layer was
01d d m== . The number of nodes retained in the 
pooling layer was 
 . The proportion of preserved brain regions in the left and right hemispheres was 
A and
B . We designed a 
three layer MLP (
10m ,
20 1m+ , and two neurons per layer) that took the flattened graph as the input and predicted SZ versus 
HC. After debugging, we set 
10= to achieve an optimal accuracy of 83.62% on the COBRE dataset for 
45 W= , 
5s= , and
0.9 0.1AB==（ ）
and achieved an optimal accuracy of 89.71% on the UCLA dataset for 
95 W= ,
10s= , and 
0.7 0.3AB==（ ） . 
B. Model Comparison  
1) Comparison with the baseline model:   
In this study, the baseline models based on sFC and dFC were used separately for comparison. There are five main types of 
baseline models.  
a) Traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms for sFC: Principal component analysis (PCA) + SVM.  
b) Traditional DL algorithms for sFC: Convolutional neural networks (CNN)  
c) Advanced static brain network deep learning analysis method for the sFC: Br ainGNN [32]  
d) Advanced DL algorithms for dFC: GAT, UniMP  
e) New dynamic brain network deep learning analysis methods for the dFC: HFCN [33] and CRNN [12].  
The kernel function of the SVM classifier was a polynomial kernel function (linear) and the PCA (n_components = 0.9) consiste d 
of three composite convolutional laye rs and one fully connected classification layer. Each comp osite convolutional layer consisted 
of a convolutional layer and a maximum pooling layer. The model architectures of the BrainGNN, HFCN, and CRNN followed 
the setup of the original paper, and the sliding window size of the models was adjusted accordingly i n this study. The GAT model 
consisted of two GATConv layers, one Top-kPool , and one fully connected classification layer. The output size of the fully 
connected classification layer was two. The UniMP model consisted of two UniMPConv layers, one Top -kPool layer, and one 
fully connected classification layer. The output size of the fully connected classification layer was two.

TABLE  I 
COMPARISON OF THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE WITH DIFFERENT BASELINE MODELS  
 
As shown in Table I , the temporal -BCGCN model slightly outperforms the baseline methods on the COBRE dataset and 
significantly outperforms the baseline methods on the UCLA dataset under a one -tailed two -sample t -test of 
0.05p .Specifically, 
the traditional ML algorithm PCA + SVM and the traditional deep learning algorithm CNN exhibit the worst results. The GAT, 
UniMP , HFCN, and CRNN models using dFC features perform slightly worse than BrainGNN using sFC featur es, whereas the 
temporal -BCGCN model proposed in this study outperforms BrainGNN. Therefore, although dFC contains more feature 
information than sFC, the performance of the model using dFC can be better than that of the advanced sFC model only if a suit able 
analysis framework is adopted.  For example, DSF -BrainNet was proposed to build a topology for brain networks with synchronous 
temporal changes. TemporalConv was then proposed to maintain the synchronous time -varying features of the brain network 
during c onvolutional pooling. Maybe these reasons are  why the Temporal -BCGCN model outperformed the other baseline models 
on both datasets. In conclusion, the proposed method is a superior tool for dynamic brain network analysis compared to other brain 
network ana lysis methods.  
2) Comparison with state -of-the-art methods  
This study also compared the proposed model with the current state -of-the-art research for SZ classification and diagnosis, as 
shown in  Table II . In both datasets, Temporal -BCGCN exhibits  better performance than the other state -of-the-art methods. The 
proposed model improves the ACC by at least 1.20% on the COBRE dataset and 6.22% on the UCLA dataset, significantly 
outperforming the other methods.  These results demonstrate the rationality of the Temporal -BCGCN model and its superior 
representative learning capability.

C. Ablation Experiment  
In this section, we conduct the following ablation experiments to demonstrate the importance of the three key modules SPA, 
TemporalConv and CategoryPool.  
1) Importance of SPA algorithm in DSF -BrainNet  
In this study, the node features in DSF -BrainNet were repl aced by the raw rs -fMRI sequences without reduction, and the features 
after reduction using the PCA algorithm. It should be noted that both the raw rs -fMRI sequence and the reduction features of the 
SPA or PCA algorithms have temporal characteristics. As s hown in Fig. 5 , Temporal -BCGCN achieves the best classification 
ACC and F1 -Score for both COBRE and UCLA when the graph node features are constructed using the SPA algorithm. The above 
results indicate that the dynamic synchronization feature constructed b y DSF -BrainNet using the SPA algorithm is more conducive 
to training the Temporal -BCGCN model.   COBRE( MEAN ± STD, %) UCLA( MEAN ± STD, %)

2) Superiority of TemporalConv  
To demonstrate fully the difference in the effectiveness of ECConv and TemporalConv, this study discusses the ACC of 
temporal -BCGCN networks based on ECConv and TemporalConv with different window widths 
W  and step size s 
s for the 
COBRE and UCLA datasets, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6 . We also present the model results for ECConv,  GATConv, 
UniMP Conv, and TemporalConv  under the optimal hyperparameter configuration in Table III. 
 
 
Fig. 6.   ACC of Temporal -BCGCN models based on ECConv and TemporalConv with different window widths 
W  and step sizes 
s . 
 
As shown in Fig. 6 , the ACC of the Temporal -BCGCN model with TemporalConv is higher than that with ECConv, and it 
remains stable at a higher level than that of ECConv for different parameter settings. The ACC of the ECConv -based model 
decreases as the wind ow width 
W  increases, apparently because ECConv convolves node and edge features in a fully connected 
manner, which results in the imperfect exclusion of redundant information. Specifically, as W increases, more time slices ove rlap, 
and more redundant information is present in the node and edge vectors. However, ECConv feeds all edge vectors into a shared 
MLP for fully connected operation  during convolutional message passing, and the adaptive parameters of this MLP are 
simultaneousl y applied to each component of each edge vector under different time slices. As the overlap between time slices 
increases, the redundancy of the data corresponding to the adaptive parameters increases further, resulting in a rapid decrease in 
the ability o f ECConv to exclude redundant information. TemporalConv introduces an exclusive adaptive parameter 
,ijvv  to adjust 
the current edge vector components dynamically,  which to a certain extent eliminates the mutual interference between time slices 
and reduces the redundancy of information. In summary, TemporalConv can capture the implied brain dynamics more stably when 
excluding overlapping information between time slic es.

TABLE  III 
COMPARISON OF TEMPORAL CONV WITH VARIOUS GRAPH CONVOLUTION STRATEGIES  
 
As shown in Table III , TemporalConv  exhibits the best overall performance on the COBRE and UCLA datasets under the 
optimal hyperparameter configuration. In particular, compared with the other models, all metrics are optimal and exceed 80%, 
except for the SEN of COBRE, which is lower than th at of the UniMPConv  model.  
3) Superiority of CategoryPool  
In thi s study, CategoryPool was used under the Top -kPool, SortPool [ 38] and SAGPool [ 39] pool ing strategies. As shown in 
Table IV , the average accuracies  of the models on the COBRE and UCLA datasets im proved by 2.32% and 4.14% respectively 
when each pooling method was nested using CategoryPool than when used alone. Simultaneously, the standard deviations of the 
models nested in CategoryPool converged; that is, the model quality was more stable. In summa ry, CategoryPool can improve the 
performance of various pooling strategies for specific problems. The reason for this improvement may be that, for rs -fMRI data, 
pooling the left and right hemispheres into different categories not only adapts to the charact eristics of the data, but also captures 
some key features.

V. DISCUSSION  
To explore the hemispheric laterality abnormality in SZ patients , the brain was divided into two categories: left and right 
hemispheres, then pooled with CategoryPool, and 
A  and 
B  were used to explore the lateralization abnormality of the brain and 
its disease biomarkers. In this section, the lateralization abnormalities in the brain of sperm patients will be explored spe cifically 
by discussing the existence of hemispheric laterali zation abnormalities in SZ patients and providing an analysis of these 
abnormalities in SZ patients.

To test whether there is abnormal lateralization in the brains of SZ patients, we firstly set the same status between the lef t and 
right hemispheres, namely,
0.5 0.5AB==（ ） . Secondly, during pool training, adaptive scores were introduced to describe the 
importance of preserving the brain areas. Finally, the adaptive scores of the brain regions retained 10 times 5-fold cross -validations  
were accumulated and ranked ; the top 10  brain regions are shown in Table V , where the number of left hemisphere regions is seven 
in both datasets, significantly exceeding the right hemisphere . This finding also suggests that pathological changes in the left 
hemisphere of SZ patients may be more  favorable for model classification training. In summary, there were more group -
differentiated lesions in the left hemisphere of SZ patients. Moreover, brain regions that appeared simultaneously in both da tasets 
were regarded as potential disease biomarker s (bold in Table V ), as shown in Fig. 7 . Specifically, under the condition of equal 
status between the left and right hemispheres, the potential disease biomarkers identified in this study were located in the DMN 
(PCUN.RandSFGmed.L) and the VN (SOG. LandFF G.L).

To analyze further the abnormal lateralization of the left hemisphere in SZ patients, under the COBRE and UCLA datasets, the 
model achieved the highest accuracy w hen 
0.9 0.1AB==（ ）  and 
0.7 0.3AB==（ ）  (i.e., when it was more inclined to choose 
left brain features) , respectively. The importance of the lesions in the brain regions corresponding to the above values is listed in 
Table VI  (top 10).  Under both datasets, the top 10 brain regions were located in the left hemisphere, which further verified the 
conclusion dr awn in Part A of this section.  Additionally, brain regions that appeared simultaneously in both datasets were regarded 
as potential disease biomarkers (bold in  Table VI ), as shown in Fig. 8 . Specifically, the disease biomarkers identified in this study 
were located in the VN (IOG. LandCAL. L), DAN (PreCG. L), and DMN (SFGmed. L) with the highest accuracy.  
In summary, the results of the present study suggest that the left hemisphere of the brain in SZ patients seems to play a mor e 
critical role in classifica tion prediction, which may suggest more severe lesions in the left hemisphere of the brain in SZ patients. 
Both Tables V and VI show that accurate classification of SZ can be achieved based on the functional characteristics between the 
lower order  perceptu al networks (VN and SMN) and the higher  order  networks (DMN and LN). Indeed, it has been demonstrate d 
that SZ involves many brain regions and is considered a widespread disconnected brain disease [ 40, 41, 42 ]. Meanwhile, the 
presence of functional abnormal ities in DMN brain regions was shown to be associated with reduced interhemispheric FC in the 
left intrahemisphere [4]. Xie et al.  [18] found that the syrinx gyrus in DMN of schizophrenic patients exhibited greater rs -fMRI 
signal variability and that this variability tended to be lateralized to the left.  
More importantly, the SFGmed.L, located in the DMN network, was labeled as an important potential disease biomarker in 
Tables V and VI. Moreover, studies have identified the importance of this brain region in SZ. For example, Zhang et al.  [19] 
observed significant hemispheric effects in 10 brain regions, including the precentral gyrus and medial part of the superior frontal 
gyrus, as well as the precentral gyrus and medial part of the superior frontal gyrus, which showed a left -leaning pre dominance in 
terms of regional efficiency. Pan et al.  [43] found a significant reduction in connectivity at the whole -brain level in SZ patients 
whose working memory capacity was positively correlated with the strength of connections in SFGmed.L -SFGmed.R a nd 
SFGmed.L -ACG.R. Furthermore, consistent with the sensory gating hypothesis, the present study found significant predictive 
precision in the lower order perceptual system (occipital and primary sensorimotor cortex) , reflecting dysregulation of the primar y 
perceptual system  in these two datasets [ 44]. Higher order brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex , also s howed good 
discrimination, which may be related to the executive dysfunction of the patients.  
VI. CONCLUSION  
In summary, in the future, we will de velop more targeted deep learning functional modules based on the characteristics of medical 
image data itself to realize fully the potential of deep learning methods in medical image processing. In this study, a power ful and 
advanced model for dynamic bra in network analysis, Temporal -BCGCN, was employed for computer -aided diagnosis and 
hemispheric lateralization analysis of SZ patients . The proposed model includes the following: (1) a unique dynamic functional 
brain network module  DSF-BrainNet; (2) a revol utionary convolution method TemporalConv; and (3) a novel pooling strategy 
CategoryPool. The proposed model yielded average accuracies of 83.62% and 89.71% for the COBRE and UCLA datasets, 
respectively, exceeding those of the baseline models and other stat e-of-the-art methods. This study showed that the lower order 
perceptual system and higher order network regions in the left hemisphere are more severely dysfunctional than those in the r ight 
hemisphere in SZ. It also confirmed the significance of the left medial superior frontal gyrus (SFGmed.L) in SZ. In conclusion, 
Temporal -BCGCN provides a promising means of restoring the spatiotemporal characteristics of cerebral neurodynamics and 
identifies the lateralization abnormalities of SZ patients. In the future , we will extend the use of TemporalConv to explore further 
the patterns of abnormal activation under each time slice of the brain .
