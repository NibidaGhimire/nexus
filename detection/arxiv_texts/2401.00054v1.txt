iiiAbstract
The late time acceleration of the Universe has challenged contemporary cosmology since its
discovery. General Relativity explains this phenomenon by introducing the cosmological constant,
named the standard cosmological model (ΛCDM). However, the cosmological constant solution
has several drawbacks that have led cosmologists to explore and propose alternative models to
explain the late time acceleration of the Universe. These alternatives span from models of a
dynamical dark fluid, known as “dark energy”, to models of large-scale modifications of the
gravitational interaction, known as “modified gravity”.
The first chapter briefly introduces background formulation, fundamental gravity theories, and
cosmological observations. In chapters 2-5, we investigate the dark sector of the Universe in
modified gravity using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and large datasets derived
from measurements of the background expansion of the Universe.
Chapter 2 discusses the acceleration of the Universe by incorporating bulk viscosity in f(R,T)
gravity. Incorporating bulk viscosity into the f(R,T) gravity model violated the strong energy
condition describing the accelerated expansion. In chapters 3 and 4, we examine the theoretical
viability of f(Q,T) gravity. We investigate f(Q,T) gravity using the matter-dominated Universe
and the effective equation of state. To achieve this, we constrain the two models with the Hubble
dataset, Union 2.1 and Pantheon supernovae datasets, and the BAO dataset with the analyses of
numerous cosmological parameters. The study indicates whether the f(Q,T) gravity models are
supported by the observational data in comparison to the ΛCDM scenario. The reconstructed
models of dark energy exhibit accelerating behavior and deviate from the ΛCDM at certain
redshifts.
In chapter 5, we analyze the exponential f(Q) gravity to examine the formation of structures
and the viable cosmology. The study aims to reproduce feasible results within f(Q) gravity
using MCMC constraints and N-body + SPH simulations. We deduce CDM+baryons over
density/temperature/mean molecular weight fields, matter power spectrum, bispectrum, two-
point correlation function, and halo mass function. Therefore, the outcomes for small and large
simulation boxes are appropriately compared. Chapter 6 finishes with concluding remarks and a
discussion of the thesis with an eye toward the future.Dedicated to
Mom, Dad and Brother

Introduction and Theoretical
Background
1.1 General Introduction and Motivation
Cosmology is the large-scale scientific study of the Universe, its elements, and its past and future.
In the past two decades, cosmology has advanced significantly as a science, with unexpectedly
fast-paced information regarding the creation, structure, and evolution of the Universe. Einstein’s
general theory of relativity (GR) is a well-known classic field theory of gravity. It incorporates and
goes beyond Newton’s approach, which applies only to particles travelling in a weak gravitational
field with modest velocities (slower than the speed of light). GR is essential for discussing
cosmological scenarios or those that require strong gravity, such as compact stellar objects which
includes neutron stars, black holes and white dwarfs [ 1–5]. Black holes, where the gravity is
so intense that even light cannot escape from them, were predicted to exist within Einstein’s
theory. In addition, over the past century, GR has continued to achieve significant successes,
including the prediction of the existence of Gravitational Waves (GW), which was confirmed by
the detection of GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)
and the prediction of the existence of Black Holes (BH), which was observed by the Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT) [ 6,7]. Moreover, GR, a theory of dynamical spacetime, naturally provides a
framework for an expanding Universe. The first general relativistic cosmological model, which
corresponds to a static, homogeneous, and isotropic Universe with spherical geometry, was put
forth by Einstein in 1917 [ 8]. But, the gravitational force of matter caused this model to be
unstable. Later, Einstein modified his equation of general relativity by adding a new component
known as the cosmological constant denoted by Λ. This new term is used to describe a type of
anti-gravity effect because it opposes the gravitational attraction of matter. Despite including
the cosmological constant, it turns out that the Einstein static Universe is still sensitive to small
1Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 2
perturbations. In the early 1920s, Russian Mathematician Alexander Friedmann discovered
that Einstein gravitational field equations contained non-static solutions that might describe
an expanding Universe whose size varies with time. The explanations provided by Friedmann
demonstrated that our Universe began around 13 billion years ago in a single event [ 9]. Therefore,
according to Friedmann’s solutions, the Universe, all matter, space and time itself appeared
all at once in a single instant. British scientist Fred Hoyle called this theory the “Big Bang”.
Under this term, it came to represent the accepted cosmological paradigm, according to which
the Universe was created at a single point at an extremely high density and temperature. After
learning about this study, Einstein promptly abandoned the cosmological constant as the greatest
error of his life.
After that Edwin Hubble, in 1929 [ 10] observed that all galaxies recede from us by measuring
the distance between them. Additionally, he introduced the Hubble constant H0in units of
km/s/Mpc , along with the expansion law [ 11]v=H0d, where vis the speed of the galaxy
receding away from Earth and dis the distance between the observed galaxy and Earth.
It indicates that greater distances translate into greater receding velocities. As a result, the
expansion of the Universe appeared to be practically established. The emergence of the Friedmann-
Lemaˆ ıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric by Friedmann, Lemaˆ ıtre, Robertson, and Walker
independently in the 1920s could be considered as the beginning of this field [ 9,12]. Soon
after, observations revealed that the Universe was expanding, a phenomenon that the FLRW
solution could easily account for. The existence of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
(CMBR) is another prediction made using the FLRW metric. That is, the CMBR has a thermal
black-body spectrum at a uniform temperature of T≈2.7Kat the present epoch, corresponding
to microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum which affects the formation of galaxies [ 17].
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson observed this spectrum in 1965 [ 13]. This finding has been
recognized as a support to the cosmological model, which asserts that the Universe has expanded
since the Big Bang and is homogeneous and isotropic at large scales. Hence, the following years
have witnessed remarkable developments in the theoretical and observational sectors.
According to observational studies of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) conducted in 1998, the Universe
is currently expanding more rapidly than previously thought. Two groups, Riess and Schmidt
[14] (the High-Z Supernova Search Team), and Perlmutter [ 15] (Supernova Cosmology Project)
acquired the lead in this study and found that the galaxy and its clusters are moving apart from
one other in an accelerated rate. Various observations, including data from the Planck satellite
[16], led to the astounding discovery that the observable Universe contains only 4% to 5% of
conventional matter composed of baryons and electrons. The remaining balance of the Universe
comprises of two fundamentally unidentified components: dark matter (25%) and dark energy
(70%). The ΛCDM (Λ cold dark matter) paradigm, which assumes that cold dark matter is the
predominant component in a Universe whose late-time dynamics are determined by Einstein’s
cosmological constant, was developed due to these astounding results in modern cosmology.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 3
Hence, the accelerated expansion of the Universe has been the most perplexing phenomenon in
cosmology for the previous two decades.
But, our current cosmological framework presents a somewhat hazy image. It suffers with
severe theoretical issues including dark matter, dark energy, and the Hubble tension. Let us
take a quick look at these three issues one by one. Based on the observations, most of the
mass is found in the center of galaxy. According to the rotational curves of galaxies, which
represent the velocity versus the radial distance from the galaxy’s center, the velocity of stars
or gas reaches a maximum and remains constant regardless of the radial distance from the
galaxy’s center. By Kepler’s law, one would expect the velocity to begin to fall with distance
after reaching a maximum. It has been suggested that the presence of dark matter, a distinct
component of matter from baryonic matter, which does not interact via electromagnetism, is
required to explain this phenomenon. Dark matter has never been directly detected before. One
can check [ 18,19] for further information. High-precision observational data has provided great
substantial confirmation that the Universe is going through an accelerated expansion phase,
which is pertinent to the issue of dark energy. Invoking the ΛCDM paradigm is the simplest
way to explain cosmic acceleration in recent times. However, suppose that the vacuum energy
of the gravitational field is made up of the cosmological constant, then, the theory predicts
a discrepancy between the theoretical and observed values of the cosmological constant. The
expected theoretical value exceeds the observed value by nearly 60 orders of magnitude. The
theoretical value derived from quantum-mechanical processes utilizing the standard model is
10−60M4
Pl, where MPlis the Planck mass, whereas the observed value is 10−120M4
Pl. This results
in a cosmological constant problem. Also, the Hubble tension [ 20] is an additional issue that can
be addressed in two ways: by directly measuring the speed of the nearest galaxies as they recede
or by extrapolating it from inhomogeneity of the CMB. However, the reason why these two do
not produce the same Hubble parameter values is unknown.
The preceding discussion has been independent of any mathematical equations. We shall now
establish connections between the mathematical formulation and the underlying physical concepts
of some theories. One can now mention the main fundamental ideas on which GR is based on. It
is important to keep in mind that, any gravitational field can be understood mathematically and
is closely related to a substantial change in the spacetime metric gµν. Geometrically, the metric
tensor represents the distance between two adjacent points in the spacetime continuum. In GR,
the gravitational field is defined by the quantities that characterize the inherent geometrical
characteristics and structure of spacetime. It has been acknowledged that GR has issues at
both small and large scales, despite its excellent accord with most observational data. The main
problems with the ΛCDM model in GR to create a cosmological model are described in the
further sections. This paves the way for physics beyond General Relativity, which may address
the issues mentioned earlier through modified gravity. Specifically, the new theory must behave
similarly to GR on the solar system’s scale. Therefore, we have additional ways to modify GR.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 4
One might change the matter content by adding new types of matter to the right side of the
Einstein equations, or one could change the geometry through modifications to the left side of
the Einstein equations.
The most attractive aspect of GR is its geometric interpretation. After understanding the
geometrization of gravity, theories employing geometric concepts are of particular interest. Since
it can be derived using the metric gµνand its derivatives, the connection in Einstein’s theory
of gravity is, in a sense, secondary to the metric. One is then confronted with the well-known
Riemannian geometry, in which the structure of the manifold is entirely determined by its
metric. In this instance, the connection, which is the Levi-Civita connection, is symmetric and
metric compatible ( ∇αgµν= 0). The most basic modification can be achieved by considering a
generalized action by substituting an arbitrary function for the gravitational Lagrangian Rof the
Einstein-Hilbert (EH) action S=R 1
2kR+Lm√−gd4x, where k=8πG
c4,Gis the gravitational
constant and cis the speed of light in vacuum. This led to the development of f(R) theories
with some significant works studied in [ 21–25]. An alternative approach to f(R) gravity, as
discussed in [ 26], introduces further modifications to the Einstein-Hilbert (EH) action. This is
achieved by including a coupling term between matter and gravity, represented by an arbitrary
function f(R,T), where Tdenotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT), a tensorial
quantity characterizes the energy and flux of matter. It is worth mentioning that the covariant
divergence of the energy-momentum tensor in f(R,T) gravity is not conserved, resulting in the
non-geodesic motion of massive test particles. The coupling effects between matter and geometry
results in the particles experiencing an extra acceleration. Works in [ 27–32] have more findings
onf(R,T) gravity.
Another way to extend the geometry would be to relax the Riemannian constraints. There
are, however, other gravity theories in which the metric is introduced as a fundamental field
variable with a different independent connection where the curvature plays a secondary role. This
connection is intended to have a vanishing curvature, in contrast to the Levi-Civita connection,
but one that permits non-vanishing torsion, non-metricity, or both. H. Weyl [ 33] made an
innovative approach with the primary goal of geometrically uniting gravity and electromagnetism.
Weyl’s theory employs a mechanism with two connections: one transmits information about a
vector’s length, while the other regulates the vector’s direction during parallel transport. The
non-zero covariant divergence of the metric tensor, a trait that lead to a new geometrical quantity
called non-metricity, is the most remarkable aspect of the theory. Meanwhile, the idea of torsion
was introduced, which led to another significant advancement in differential geometry, i.e., the
Einstein-Cartan theory [ 34]. Weitzenb¨ ock provided a different exquisite geometrical formalism
known as Weitzenb¨ ock spaces [ 35], where the manifold possesses the properties Rµ
νλσ= 0,
Tµ
νλ̸= 0, and ∇µgνλ= 0. One can notice that, the Weitzenb¨ ock space reduces to a Euclidean
manifold when Tµ
νλ= 0. In a Weitzenb¨ ock manifold, the Riemann curvature tensor vanishes
identically, resulting in distant parallelism, also known as teleparallelism or absolute parallelism.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 5
The fundamental idea behind the teleparallel formulation of gravity is to replace the spacetime
metric, or primary geometrical variable gµνwith a collection of tetrad vectors ei
ν. Then,
gravitational processes can be described entirely using the torsion tensor produced by the tetrad
fields, with the curvature being substituted by torsion. As a result, this leads to the so-called
teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) [ 36], and its extension is referred to as
thef(T) gravity theory [ 37,38], where Tis the torsion scalar. Torsion precisely balances
curvature, which has the critical consequence that spacetime becomes a flat manifold, and this
is the fundamental characteristic of teleparallel theories. The fact that second-order differential
equations are used to describe the gravitational field is another significant characteristic of f(T)
gravity theories. More detailed analysis of f(T) theory can be seen in [ 39–42]. Let us now talk
about the third equivalent formulation of GR.
One can note that the non-metricity Qdisappears in both the curvature based and teleparallel
formulations. Geometrically Qdepicts the change in a vector’s length in parallel transport. Now,
a non-vanishing non-metricity Qis considered the fundamental geometrical variable accountable
for all varieties of gravitational interactions in a third equivalent formalism of GR, named
symmetric teleparallel equivalent to gravity relativity (STEGR) [ 43]. Non-metric gravity is
another name for these non-metricity based gravitational theories. While having a Lagrangian
represented by the non-metricity scalar Q, equivalent to GR description of gravity, a generalization
of the Lagrangian with a generic function of the non-metricity f(Q) gives a different description
of the grvitational interaction. Various physical and geometrical characteristics of symmetric
teleparallel gravity and f(Q) gravity have been studied in different research studies, and interest
in this kind of theoretical approach to gravity is increasing rapidly [ 42,44–53]. Furthermore,
the authors in [ 44] established a non-minimal connection between the non-metricity Qand the
matter Lagrangian Lmas the foundation for an extension of the f(Q) gravity. The non-minimal
interaction between the geometry and matter sectors predictably results in the non-conservation
of the energy-momentum tensor and the development of an additional force in the geodesic
equation of motion. Another extension of the theory, known as the f(Q,T) gravity, was proposed
by Xu. et al. in [ 54], where the gravity Lagrangian is essentially an arbitrary function of Qand
the trace of the energy-momentum tensor T. The authors explored the dynamical evolution for
several specific coupling functions.
The current dissertation intends to show several ways to investigate late time cosmology or to
look at probable places for future investigations in order to shed more light on the dark sector of
the Universe. To explore the accelerated phase of the Universe, we shall mainly concentrate on
modified theories of gravity. This chapter includes an overview of the background dynamics, the
cosmic observations, the standard model of cosmology, and its extensions.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 6
1.2 Foundations
This section discusses the fundamental differential geometry concepts that allow for constructing
both Riemannian and non-Riemannian spacetime. We will present the basic concepts and
principles of GR1. This section’s primary objective is to introduce differential manifolds, vectors,
tensors, and other mathematical concepts used to describe the properties of physical objects
[55, 56].
1.2.1 Manifolds
A manifold is one of the most fundamental concepts in both Mathematics and Physics. Math-
ematicians developed the theory of analysis in Rnover many years. However, we naturally
associate specific other spaces with curved spaces or topological complexity. To address the
concept, there is a manifold which refers to a space that may be curved and have a complex
topology but which, in certain localized sections, resembles Rn.
We first require the concept of topology and topological space to introduce a manifold.
Definition 1.1. Let M be any set, and τ={Ui, i∈I}denote a collection of subsets of M. The
pair (M , τ) is a topological space ifτsatisfies the following conditions:
(i)∅, M∈τ,
(ii) If Jis any subcollection of I, the family {Uj, j∈J}satisfiesS
j∈JUj∈τ,
(iii) If Kis any finite subcollection of I, the family {Uk, k∈K}satisfiesT
k∈KUk∈τ.
Here, U iare known as open sets, τis referred to as a topology on M, and M is a topological
space. In fact, a topology on a set provided by a metric function is known as metric2topology.
Additionally, if the inverse image of an open set is also an open set, then a map between two
topological spaces is continuous. Similar to the notion of continuity in topology, the theory
of manifolds has smoothness. A function is referred to Cr, if its rthderivative exists and is
continuous. Thus, C∞functions are referred to as smooth.
Definition 1.2. For any p,q∈M, with p̸=q, there exists U 1, U2∈τsuch that p∈U1,q∈U2
and U 1∩U2=∅. Topological spaces satisfying such conditions are called Hausdorff space .
Definition 1.3. Ahomeomorphism between topological spaces is a continuous bijective map
whose inverse map is also continuous.
1Refer to: Introduction to General Relativity and Cosmology by Christian G. B¨ ohmer
2A metric d:X×X→Ris a function that is symmetric, non-degenerate and obeys a triangle inequality.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 7
Definition 1.4. An n-dimensional differentiable manifold is a Hausdorff topological space M
that satisfies the following conditions:
(i)M is locally homeomorphic to Rn. This means that for each p∈M, there is an open set U
such that p∈U and a homeomorphism ϕ: U→OwithOan open subset of Rn.
(ii)Consider two open sets U αand U βsuch that U α∩Uβ̸=∅. The corresponding maps
ϕα: Uα→Oαandϕβ: Uβ→Oβare compatible, that means the map ϕβ◦ϕ−1
α:
ϕα(Uα∩Uβ)→ϕβ(Uα∩Uβ) is smooth (infinitely differentiable), as is its inverse.
The maps ϕαare called charts and the collection of charts is called an atlas. The maps ϕβ◦ϕ−1
α
take us between different coordinate systems3and are called transition functions. A chart (U , ϕ)
on M is said to be compatible with a C∞-atlasAon M if A∪(U, ϕ)is aC∞-atlas. So, the two
compatible atlases define the same differentiable structure on the manifold.
1.2.2 Vectors and Tensors
In this subsection, we introduce the concepts of vectors and tensors. The most crucial aspect
to highlight is that each vector occupies a specific location in spacetime. One can commonly
think of vectors as entities that extend between two distinct points in space and even as free
vectors that can be effortlessly displaced between various points. The concept above needs
more practical utility beyond the confines of flat spaces. The capacity to define preferred curves
between points or effectively move vectors across a manifold is lost upon the introduction of
curvature. Consequently, the concept of a tangent vector is the foundation of calculus on
manifolds. Hereafter, we define the following terms.
Definition 1.5. Let F be a collection of C∞functions from M to R. We define a tangent
vector V at a point p∈M to be a map V : F →Rwhich is linear and obeys the Leibnitz rule
(i)V(af+bg) =a V(f) +b V(g),f, g∈F, and a, b∈R,
(ii)V(fg) =f(p)V(g) +g(p)V(f).
The object ∂µ|p=∂
∂xµ
pacts on functions and obeys all requirements of the tangent vector. For
a function f: M→Rand a chart ϕ= 
x1, ....., xn
in a neighbourhood of p, we define a map
f◦ϕ−1: U→Rwith U ⊂Rn. So, we differentiate functions on M as
∂f
∂xµ
p=∂(f◦ϕ−1)
∂xµ
ϕ(p).
3The coordinate associated to p∈Uαisϕα(p) = 
x1(p), x2(p), ....., xn(p)Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 8
This depends on the choice of chart ϕand coordinates xµ. However, we need a coordinate
independent definition of differentiation.
Theorem. The set of all tangent vectors at point pforms an n-dimensional vector space, which
is known as tangent space Tp(M). The tangent vector ∂µ|pprovides a basis for Tp(M). So, we
can write any tangent vector as
Vp=Vµ∂
∂xµ
p,
with Vµ=Vp(xµ).
The crucial notion is that a certain tangent vector Vpexists regardless of the coordinate system
used. However, the chosen basis {∂µ|p}depends on our choice of coordinates: charts ϕand
coordinates xµ.
Suppose that we chose a different chart ϕ′with the coordinates x′µnear p. The tangent vector
Vpis expressed as
Vp=Vµ∂
∂xµ
p=V′µ∂
∂x′µ
p.
Here, the components of the vector vary, while the vector itself remains the same. It should be
noted that by applying the chain rule and the tangent vector Vpacting on a function f, one can
express
Vp(f) =Vµ∂ f
∂xµ
p=Vµ∂x′ν
∂xµ
ϕ(p)∂ f
∂x′ν
p.
This can be viewed as
∂

p=∂x′ν
∂xµ
ϕ(p).∂
∂x′ν
p,
V′µ=Vµ∂x′ν
∂xµ. (1.1)
This type of component transformation is referred to as contravariant.
Avector field Vis defined to be a smooth assignment of a tangent vector Vpto each point
p∈M.
Definition 1.6. The dual space to the tangent space Tp(M) is called a cotangent space T∗
p(M).
It is the space of all linear maps from Tp(M) to R.
The gradients of the coordinate function xµoffer a natural basis for the cotangent space, just as
the partial derivative along coordinate axes does for the tangent space such that
dxµ(∂ν) =∂xµ
∂x′ν=δµ
ν.
which further results in
W′
µ=∂xµ
∂x′µWµ. (1.2)Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 9
This type of component transformation is referred to as covariant. Now, we are ready to define
a tensor.
Definition 1.7. A(m, n)tensor is a multilinear map from a collection of mdual vectors and n
vectors to R. Hence, we write
Aµ1.....µ mν1.....νn=A(dxµ1, ......, dxµm, ∂ν1, ....., ∂ νn).
Using the transformation laws of vectors and dual vectors in equations (1.1) and(1.2), the
general coordinate transformation for tensor is
A′µ′
1.....µ′
m
ν′
1.....ν′n=∂x′µ′

∂xµ1......∂x′µ′
m
∂xµm∂xν1
∂x′ν′
1........∂xνn
∂x′ν′nAµ1.....µ mν1.....νn. (1.3)
Now, we define an important aspect to define the distance between two points in the space.
1.2.3 The Metric
The metric structure enables the definition of distance between any two spacetime points. A
metric is meant to inform us the infinitesimal squared distance associated with an infinitesimal
displacement and is instead an inner product on each vector space Tp(M).
Definition 1.8. The metric is a tensor of type (0 ,2) which is
(i) Symmetric: g(V1, V2) =g(V2, V1),V1,V2∈Tp(M),
(ii) Non-degenerate: For any p∈M,g(V, V 1) = 0 for all V∈Tp(M), then V1= 0.
We may expand gin terms of its components gµνin a coordinate basis as
g=gµνdxµ⊗dxν.
This further can be written as
ds2=gµνdxµdxν, (1.4)
with g=det(gµν). Furthermore, putting gµνinto its canonical form yields a meaningful
characterization4of the metric as gµν=diag(−1,−1, .....,−1,+1,+1, ...+ 1,0, ......0). The
signature of the metric is the number of positive and negative eigenvalues. If all signs are positive,
we refer to the metric as Euclidean or Riemannian. If there is a negative sign, the metric is
called Lorentzian or pseudo-Riemannian. Otherwise, it is referred to as indefinite.
4A square matrix can be reduced to a diagonal matrix.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 10
1.3 General Relativity
The initial stage in the development of the theory of gravitation involves the establishment of
a mathematical framework that enables the formulation of the laws of physics in a covariant
fashion. The formulation of the laws of physics can be achieved by utilizing vectors and tensors,
which are mathematical entities possessing transformation qualities that embody the concept
of covariance in physical laws. Therefore, we commence our discussion by examining the
fundamental differential operations that may be derived from vectors and tensors. One can
review some concepts in [57].
1.3.1 Some Important Concepts
Definition 1.9 (Christoffel Symbol ).A special connection that we might draw from the
metric is represented by an object known as the Christoffel symbol and is provided by
Γα
µν=1
2gαλ(∂µgνλ+∂νgλµ−∂λgµν). (1.5)
Although the three index symbol or Christoffel symbol resembles a tensor, it is not a tensor.
It is symmetric in its lower pair of indices by definition. Consequently, the dyad produces
n(n+1)
2components in ndimensions. No other symmetries exist, so the third index can take any
value, resulting inn2(n+1)
2independent components in ndimensions. The main purpose of this
connection is to generate covariant derivatives, a generalization of partial derivatives.
Definition 1.10 (Covariant Derivative ).An operator ∇known as covariant derivative
produces a tensor when applied to a tensor in a way entirely independent of coordinates. It is
defined as follows
∇µAν=∂µAν+ Γν
µλAλ. (1.6)
Furthermore, the general expression for the covariant derivative is
∇λAµ1µ2....µnν1ν2....νm=∂λAµ1µ2....µnν1ν2....νm+Γµ1

−Γσ
λν1Aµ1µ2....µnσν2....νm−Γσ
λν2Aµ1µ2....µnν1σ....ν m−..... (1.7)
Definition 1.11 (Parallel Transport ).Parallel transport describes the idea of transporting a
vector along a path while keeping its orientation constant. Let xµ(λ) be a path with tangent
vectordxµ
dλand assume Aµbe a vector. Then, we say Aµis parallelly transported along a path if
dxµ
dλ.∇µAν= 0. (1.8)Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 11
Following the discussion of the definition of parallel transport, we will move on to geodesics.
A geodesic is a mathematical construct that generalizes the motion of a straight line across
Euclidean space to motion through curved space. If we have two points connected by a curve/path,
we may use the arc length to determine the distance between these places along that curve. The
curves that minimize the distance between our points are of particular interest to us. Let us
summarize this as a definition.
Definition 1.12 (Geodesics ).A curve/path xµ(λ) is called a geodesic if it satisfies the equation
d2xµ
dλ2+ Γµ
δσdxδ
dλdxσ
dλ= 0 , (1.9)
where Γµ
σνis the Christoffel symbol.
Definition 1.13 (Riemann Tensor ).The Riemann tensor or curvature tensor is a tensor of
type (1 ,3) defined as
Rµ
νσλ=∂σΓµ
λν−∂λΓµ
σν+ Γµ
σδΓδ
λν−Γµ
λδΓδ
σν. (1.10)
It has some important relations as follows.

σλν+Rµ
λνσ= 0, (Cyclic)
3.Rµ
νσλ;δ+Rµ
νλδ;σ+Rµ
νδσ;λ= 0. (Bianchi Identity)
Definition 1.14 (Ricci Tensor ).The Ricci tensor is a type (0 ,2) tensor, which is a contracted
Riemann tensor. That is
Rµν=Rσ
µσν. (1.11)
The Ricci tensor associated with the Christoffel connection is symmetric, which is Rµν=Rνµ.
Definition 1.15 (Ricci Scalar ).The trace of the Ricci tensor is known as the Ricci Scalar.
R=Rµ
µ=gµνRµν. (1.12)
Definition 1.16 (Einstein Tensor ).The tensor Gµν=Rµν−1
2gµνRis the Einstein tensor,
which is symmetric and has a great importance in GR. Furthermore, ∇µGµν= 0. It is a
fundamental tensor quantity that describes the physical and geometrical properties of the
gravitational field.
So far, we have covered some fundamental mathematical notions and tools that will be required
in the mathematical formulation of the General Theory of Relativity. We shall now focus on the
aspect of obtaining the Einstein field equations.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 12
1.3.2 Einstein Field Equations
Einstein field equations are a set of differential equations used to characterize the gravitational
field within the framework of general relativity. These equations are defined in Riemannian
geometry, and they establish a profound relationship between the geometric properties of
spacetime and its matter content, providing a complete description of the geometric properties
of spacetime and the dynamics of the particles. We seek to find an equation that replaces
the Poisson equation for the Newtonian potential. This can be done by the application of the
principle of least action to the gravitational field.
The total action for gravity and any other physical fields present in the system is given by
S=1
2kZ
R√−g d4x+Z
Lm√−g d4x, (1.13)
where√−g d4xis a 4-dimensional volume on the manifold. gis the determinant of the metric
tensor, k=8πG
c4,Gis the Newton’s constant and Lmis the Lagrangian density of matter fields.
The variation of the above action (1.13) with respect to the metric tensor yields
Gµν=Rµν−1
2R gµν=8πG
c4Tµν, (1.14)
which are known as the Einstein field equations. We also note that the
Tµν=−2√−gδ(√−gLm)
δgµν, (1.15)
is named the energy-momentum tensor (which will be discussed in the following sections),
quantifying the matter and energy content of spacetime.
Taking the covariant divergence of the equation (1.14), we can easily find
∇µGµν≡0≡ ∇µTµν. (1.16)
This pertains to the important law of conservation of the matter-energy momentum tensor Tµν.
Finally, we may construct general relativistic theoretical models of the Universe using various
cosmological assumptions and parameters discussed in the following section.
1.4 The Standard Cosmological Model
This section describes the standard cosmological model. We discuss essential concepts such as
the FLRW metric, the Hubble parameter, and redshift, as well as the successes and flaws of theChapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 13
ΛCDM model. A more comprehensive introduction to cosmology can be found in Weinberg [ 55].
1.4.1 The FLRW Metric
Thecosmological principle states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic at all times
on large enough scales. In other words, homogeneity suggests that the Universe looks the same
to any observer at any place, but isotropy implies no preferred directions from a given position.
On the assumption that the Universe is homogeneous, it is possible to transform two particles
separated by a distance ⃗ rinto a coordinate system known as comoving coordinates by using the
formula ⃗ r=a(t)⃗ x, where ⃗ xis the comoving distance or separation between the same points in the
comoving frame. The scale factor a(t) of the Universe governs how the physical separations grow
through time. Friedmann, Lemaˆ ıtre, Robertson, and Walker (FLRW) developed the following
form for the line element in spherical coordinates, considering the geometrical properties of
homogeneity and isotropy following the cosmological principle and the fact that the Universe is
expanding

where (r, θ, ϕ )are the comoving spatial coordinates in spherical coordinate system, kis the
spatial curvature of the Universe. For the sake of simplicity, we will choose units when c= 15.
Furthermore, k=−1, 1, and 0 correspond to an open (Hyperbolic), closed (Spherical), and
flat Universe (Euclidean), respectively. When examining the geometrical properties of several

Before determining the Friedmann equations and their solutions, we will introduce additional

1.4.2 The Hubble Parameter
One can define the rate of change of the distance from the relation ⃗ r=a(t)⃗ xas
˙⃗ r=˙a(t)⃗ x=˙a(t)⃗ r
a(t), (1.20)
which gives
˙⃗ r=˙a(t)
a(t)⃗ r=H(t)⃗ r, (1.21)
where dot denotes the time derivative, and His the Hubble parameter, which provides the rate
of change of expansion of the Universe as defined by
H(t) =˙a(t)
a(t). (1.22)
From equation (1.22) , one can obtain the expression of the Hubble law at the present time:
⃗ v=H0⃗ r, where H0represents the Hubble constant at present, and ⃗ vis the velocity at which
the objects are moving away from the observer. Edwin Hubble saw it as the first observable
foundation for the expansion of the Universe in 1929. According to this principle, a galaxy’s
recession rate is proportional to its distance from the observer.
1.4.3 Redshift
The fact that practically everything in the Universe appears to be moving away from us and that
this apparent movement increases with increasing distance is a significant piece of observational
evidence in cosmology. When a photon travels through the Universe, it is inextricably linked to
the expansion of space, which causes it to expand or, more precisely, increases its wavelength.
Therefore, traveling photons lose energy in the Universe. If these photons were in the visible
spectrum, they would begin with a blue hue and a high energy level before turning to the red
spectrum as their energy decreases. This is where the term redshift originates.
Since all galaxies are moving away from us, the scientific terminology is redshift z, which is
defined by
z=λob−λem
λem, (1.23)
where λobandλemare the wavelengths of light at the points of observation and emission,
respectively. The Doppler law can now be used to establish that the difference in wavelength
between emission and reception
λob−λem
λem=dv
c, (1.24)Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 15
where λob> λ em. The time between emission and reception is given by the light travel time
dt=dr
c, which results
λob−λem
λem=˙a
adr
c=˙a
adt=da
a. (1.25)
We obtain that λ∝a, where λis the instantaneous wavelength measured at any given time.
Hence, one gets the redshift in terms of scale factor as
1 +z=λob
λem=a(tob)
a(tem). (1.26)
Next, we turn our attention to the specific energy tensor and different types of matter sources
described by it in the following section.
1.4.4 The Stress Energy-Momentum Tensor
In this section, we go over the properties of the stress-energy-momentum tensor. For modelling the
Universe, we assume that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic and also that the Universe is
filled with the perfect fluid6distribution of matter. The equation for the stress-energy-momentum
tensor is
Tµν= (ρ+p)uµuν+pgµν, (1.27)
where uµ= (1,0,0,0) is the fluid 4-velocity vector. In addition to stresses it contains information
about the energy density and energy fluxes of the matter. The contraction of Tµνresults in
Tµ
ν=diag(−ρ, p, p, p ), and the trace T=Tµ
µ=−ρ+ 3p, where ρis the energy density and pis
the pressure in all directions of the spacetime.
Further, we can recall that the stress-energy-momentum tensor satisfies the conservation equation
∇µTµν= 0, which yields
˙ρ+ 3 (ρ+p)˙a
a= 0. (1.28)
Often the perfect fluid relevant to cosmology obeys the simple equation of state
p=ωρ, (1.29)
where ωis a constant and independent of time. Using equation (1.28), one gets the relation
ρ∝a−3(1+ ω). (1.30)
One has p= 0, that is ω= 0 for the non-relativistic matter. The Universe is considered
matter-dominated if matter accounts for most of the energy density and is known as dust. The
6When a matter component is considered continuous, it cannot support shear stress. That is, we can neglect
viscosity.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 16
energy density in this case is characterized as
ρm=ρm0a−3(t). (1.31)
The Universe in which the majority of the energy density takes the form of radiation, that is
pr=1
3ρris known as a radiation-dominated Universe. The energy density, in this case, falls off
as
ρr=ρr0a−4(t). (1.32)
A vacuum-dominated Universe has an equation of state pΛ=−ρΛ, i.e. ω=−1. The energy
density here is constant and defined by
ρΛ=ρΛ0. (1.33)
Here, ρm0,ρr0, and ρΛ0represents the respective densities at t=t0. Although we have
discussed the stress-energy momentum tensor for various matter components, reviewing some
general considerations, such as what types of stresses are acceptable at varying levels, is helpful.
Consequently, energy conditions are useful for this purpose.
1.4.5 Energy Conditions
Energy conditions (ECs) serve three purposes and impose coordinate invariant restrictions on
the stress-energy-momentum tensor of the matter. First, as Einstein’s equation involves no other
properties of matter besides its stress tensor, ECs allow us to analyze the behavior of gravitating
systems without specifying the behavior of matter in detail. The crucial step that allowed
Penrose and Hawking to prove their singularity theorems [ 58,59] was bypassing a complicated
and comprehensive analysis using this method. The second purpose of ECs is to convey a concept
of ‘normal matter’ that should apply to various matter kinds. The third objective of the ECs is
conceptual simplicity. For example, the positivity of the energy density may be related to the
system’s stability, at least in the naive sense that systems are stable in classical mechanics when
the energy is bounded from below. ECs have great adequacy in classical GR, which considers the
singularity problems of spacetime and explains the behavior of spacelike, timelike, or lightlike
geodesics [ 60]. These conditions can be derived from the well-known Raychaudhuri equations of
the form [61, 62].
dθ
dτ=−1
3θ2−σµνσµν+ωµνωµν−Rµνuµuν, (1.34)
dθ
dτ=−1
2θ2−σµνσµν+ωµνωµν−Rµνnµnν, (1.35)
where θ,σµνandωµνare the expansion factor, shear and rotation associated with the geodesic
congruence defined by the vector field uµand the null vector nµ.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 17
As a result, there are different ECs, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages in terms of
the range of validity, significance and interpretations. We construct scalars from Tµν, which is
typically accomplished using arbitrary timelike vectors tµor null vectors nµ[63, 64].
The weak energy condition (WEC) is probably the most intuitive of the energy conditions. It
claims that
Tµνtµtν≥0, (1.36)
for any timelike vector tµ. For a perfect fluid, the WEC suggests that ρ+p≥0 and also, ρ≥0.
A null energy condition (NEC) is a variation of the WEC, with the timelike vector replaced by a
null vector nµsuch that
Tµνnµnν≥0. (1.37)
In the perfect fluid description, the NEC asserts ρ+p≥0. The NEC is crucial because it
determines whether the Universe will experience inflation and whether it will evolve into a
singularity or bounce solution. The NEC is weaker than the WEC.
The WEC can be generalized to dominant energy condition (DEC). It indicates that DEC and
WEC are equivalent, with the additional requirement that Tµνtµmust be either timelike or null.
It gives us the perfect fluid condition as ρ≥ |p|.
The strong energy condition (SEC) imposes a bound:

Tµν−1
2gµνT
tµtν≥0, (1.38)
for every timelike vector tµ. The SEC transforms into ρ+p≥0 and ρ+ 3p≥0 for a perfect
fluid. According to Einstein equation, SEC is strictly geometric, so Rµνtµtν≥0. This condition
is widely employed and is one of the most important conditions of the Hawking and Penrose
singularity theorems.
After determining the fundamental principles underlying the model, many quantities, which
are cosmological parameters, may remain undetermined. It is common practice to specify
cosmological models with a handful of parameters, which one then attempts to observe in order
to determine which version of the model best describes our Universe. In the following section,
we will discuss the cosmological parameters that are commonly considered.
1.4.6 Cosmological Parameters
This section discusses the relevant cosmological parameters for observational cosmology. Consider
the Taylor expansion of the scale factor about the present time t0. The general form of a(t) is
a(t) =a(t0) +˙a(t0)(t−t0) +1
2¨a(t0)(t−t0)2+1
3!...
a(t0)(t−t0)3+1
4!....
a(t0)(t−t0)4+......(1.39)Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 18
Dividing by a(t0), one gets
a(t)
a(t0)= 1 + H0(t−t0)−q0
2H2
0(t−t0)2+1
3!j0H3
0(t−t0)3+1
4!s0H4
0(t−t0)4+...... (1.40)
where t0is the present time. Here, the coefficients are named as Hubble, deceleration, jerk, snap,
lerk parameters, respectively. That is
H=˙a
a, q =−¨a
aH2, (1.41)
j=...a
aH3, s =1
aH4d4a
dt4. (1.42)
One can predict whether or not the expansion of the Universe is accelerating or decelerating.
So,q <0 represents acceleration, while q >0 represents deceleration. In addition, the change
in the sign of the jerk parameter jin an expanding model denotes an increase or decrease in
acceleration.
Now, it is time to talk about the simplest model of the Universe, as we shall see.
1.4.7 Friedmann Equations for the Standard Model
The ΛCDM model was developed to model universal dynamics such as an accelerated expansion.
It consists of a Universe evolving under GR and adding dark energy with a negative equation
of state parameter, represented by a cosmological constant. In GR, an accelerated expansion
via a cosmological constant is possible, but its origin remains unexplained. This subject will be
addressed in subsequent sections. Unless otherwise specified, we will use units such as c,ℏ= 1
for the remainder of this work, where cis the speed of light and ℏis the reduced Planck constant.
In 1915, Einstein’s theory of GR was derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action given by
S=Z
d4x√−g1
2κ(R−2Λ) + Lm
, (1.43)
where Λ is the cosmological constant and κ= 8πG. The Einstein field equations can be derived
by vanishing the variation of the action with respect to metric tensor, that is
Gµν+ Λgµν=κTµν. (1.44)
Furthermore, we examine the cosmological equations of the ΛCDM model, known as the
Friedmann equations. The equations are derived using equation (1.44) , the FLRW metric (1.17) ,Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 19
and the stress-energy momentum (1.27), we have
H2=8πG
3ρ−k
a2+Λ
3, (1.45)
2˙H+ 3H2=−8πGp−k
a2+ Λ. (1.46)
Combining equations (1.45) and (1.46) gives
¨a
a=−4πG
3(ρ+ 3p) +Λ
3, (1.47)
which is known as the acceleration equation. If ¨a >0, we call the Universe is accelerating, while
the Universe is decelerating for ¨ a <0.
There is a specific density that must exist for a particular value of Hin order to make the
geometry of the Universe flat, that is k= 0. This is named as the critical density ρc, which is
determined as
ρc=3H2
8πG. (1.48)
Understand that the critical density does not necessarily correspond to the actual density of the
Universe since the Universe need not be flat. Therefore, rather than quoting the density of the
Universe directly, referring to its value relative to the critical density is frequently more helpful.
This quantity is referred to as the density parameter Ω, defined as
Ωi(t) =ρi(t)
ρ(t)=8πG
3ρi(t)
H2(t), (1.49)
where idenotes the sum over matter, radiation, spatial curvature and vacuum. One can rewrite
the Friedmann equation (1.45) as
1 = Ω m(t) + Ω r(t) + Ω k(t) + Ω Λ(t). (1.50)
where Ω k(t) is the density parameter for curvature defined as Ω k(t) =−k
H2a2and Ω Λ(t) =8πG
3H2ρΛ,
where ρΛ=Λ
8πG. However, if k= 0, then Ω m+ Ω r+ Ω Λ= 1, i.e. Ω total= 1 at all times. The
quantities Ω iare time-dependent and we can write the values at present time Ω i,0, yielding
H2=H0
Ωm,0a−3+ Ω r,0a−4+ Ω k,0a−2+ Ω Λ,0
. (1.51)
The values for the parameters involved in the above equation (1.51) have been determined by
the Planck Collaborations in 2018 [65]. We shall now elaborate more on the success and issues
of the standard cosmological model in the next section.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 20
1.4.8 Successes of ΛCDM and its Issues
The standard cosmological model has been extraordinarily successful in characterizing the
Universe and is primarily consistent with observations. It can describe the evolution, formation
of structures that can only be explained in terms of gravitation within an inflationary, dark
energy, dark matter scenario, and the abundance of light elements that can only be explained in
primordial nucleosynthesis. Nonetheless, the ΛCDM approach faces certain shortcomings:
There is a discrepancy between the theoretical and observed values of the cosmological constant.
The expected theoretical value exceeds the observed value by nearly 60 orders of magnitude.
The theoretical value derived from quantum-mechanical processes utilizing the standard model
is 10−60M4
Pl, where MPlis the Planck mass, whereas the observed value is 10−120M4
Pl. This
discrepancy is referred to as the cosmological constant problem [66].
The Horizon problem [67] is a cosmological fine-tuning issue within the Big Bang theory
of the Universe, supported by the ΛCDM model, and is also referred to as the homogeneity
problem. It arises from the difficulty of explaining the apparent homogeneity of spatial regions
that are casually unconnected in the absence of a process that uniformly sets the initial conditions
across all regions. The most widely acknowledged explanation is exponential growth in the early
Universe or cosmic inflation.
Another is the cosmological coincidence issue [ 68], which relates to the fact that the ΛCDM
model predicts that we are in a transitional period between the matter-dominated era and
the late-time acceleration era. Observational evidence indicates that the current values of
cosmological constant matter densities are comparable in magnitude.
According to current knowledge, dark matter (DM) [69–71] is non-baryonic and does not
interact with other matter components other than gravitational interactions. Without assuming
the existence of DM with these characteristics, we cannot explain, for example, the rotational
trajectories of galaxies and the formation and distribution of structures in the Universe. Although
ΛCDM assumes the existence of dark matter, neither ground-based nor space-based experiments
have detected the signature of DM particles.
There have been disagreements between high and low redshift measurements, such as those
based on local measurements and those based on CMB measurements, with the latter assuming
ΛCDM, regarding the estimated value of present Hubble constant H0. This tension is known
asH0tension [72] and corresponds to roughly 4 .4σtension. The Planck data, measurements
of weak lensing, and redshift surveys produce a second significant source of tension known as
σ8tension [73]. This corresponds to the matter density (Ω m) and the amplitude or growth
rate of structure ( σ8, fσ8). Based on the ΛCDM, the Planck collaboration estimates S8=Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 21
σ8p
Ωm/0.3= 0.834±0.016, whereas KIDS-450 collaboration estimates S8= 0.745±0.039 [74].
This results in approximately 2 σof tension.
These constraints have necessitated the search for an alternative explanation. In the following
sections, we update various theories extending beyond ΛCDM.
1.5 Beyond ΛCDM
In light of the ΛCDM issues enumerated in the previous section, one must seek out novel
approaches that extend beyond ΛCDM and, more generally, GR. Possible alternatives to GR
will be discussed here. As a result of the flaws in the cosmological constant, new theories
to explain cosmic acceleration have been proposed. These can be grouped into two distinct
classifications, the first being dark energy (DE) models and the second being modified gravity
(MG) models. A DE model is created by adding a DE fluid component parametrized by a static
or dynamic equation of state. In MG models, the modification occurs within the gravitational
sector, resulting in different field equations from GR. For DE models, modifications are made on
the matter side of Einstein equations, ignoring Λ and typically adding additional fluid to the set
of Einstein equations.
•It is hypothesized that the dark energy EoS has changed during the evolution of the
Universe. As a result, several dynamical dark energy (DDE) models with a time-varying
EoS parameter have been proposed. Common DDE models with respect to redshift z
include the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model [ 75], the Jassal-Bagla-Padmanbhan
(JBP) model [ 76], the Barboza-Alcaniz paramterization [ 77], the Wetterich paramterization
[78], etc.
•The most widely recognized theory for DDE is the quintessence scalar field model. We
consider a scalar field minimally coupled to the matter field, where the scalar field is
time-dependent and associated with the potential V(ϕ). This ϕexerts a negative pressure,
gradually decreasing V(ϕ). Quintessence models are categorized into three types based on
the nature of potential V(ϕ). When V(ϕ)<<˙ϕ2,ω≈1, which is equivalent to the stiff
matter and does not contribute to dark energy. When V(ϕ)>>˙ϕ2,ω≈ −1, corresponds
to the cosmological constant. For −1< ω < 1, we get ρ∝a−m, which gives the accelerated
expansion for 0 ≤m < 2. The following references help readers familiarise themselves
with the wide variety of studies on late-time cosmic acceleration using various quintessence
potentials [79–82].
•Caldwell [ 83] proposed the phantom field model of DE to explain the late-time cosmic
acceleration. In this scenario, the kinetic term exhibits a negative signature. As a result ofChapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 22
its negative kinetic energy, a phantom field accelerated expansion of the Universe to an
infinite size in a finite amount of time. Big Rip depicts a future in which both the actual
volume and expansion rate are infinite. The scalar field models in which the evolution
of the EoS parameter resembles that of the phantom field are known as quintom models
[84, 85].
•The K-essence scalar field model, also known as the K-inflation [ 86–88], describes an
inflationary model of the early Universe. In contrast to the quintessence models, in which
the potential energy term causes an accelerated expansion, the K-essence scalar field
models have a dominant kinetic contribution to the energy density, causing the late-time
acceleration of the Universe.
•Another class of theories that modify Einstein’s GR provides an alternative explanation
for the occurrence of late-time cosmic acceleration. Without relying on a DE component, a
wide variety of modified gravity theories are now available in the literature that gives rise
to the rapid expansion of the Universe [ 89,90]. Among these extended theories are f(R)
gravity [ 91–97], scalar-tensor theories [ 98–103],f(T) gravity [ 41,104–108],f(Q) gravity
[51,109–113], and a few other extended theories [ 26,54,114–116]. Let us discuss some
popular theories of modified gravity in the next section.
1.6 Modified Theories of Gravity
Numerous modified theories of gravity extending beyond the standard GR model have been
proposed to build a more fundamental framework for explaining dark matter and dark energy
and resolving the current observational and theoretical contradictions. MG provides a suitable
unification of primordial inflation and cosmic acceleration. The alternative approach to the
theory of GR could prove extremely useful for unifying gravity with the theory of quantum
mechanics and other fundamental natural interactions.
The Einstein-Hilbert action can be naturally generalized within the framework of Riemannian
geometry by substituting the Ricci scalar Rwith any arbitrary function f(R). This results in
thef(R) modified theory of gravity. There are two approaches to f(R) gravity: the metric
formulation, in which the metric is viewed as the only dynamical variable, and the Palatini
formulation, in which the connection is considered a fundamental variable together with the
metric tensor. Detailed discussions of f(R) gravity can be found in [ 23,93,117,118]. The most
glaring disadvantage of the f(R) gravity theory is that the scalar field in the Palatini formulation
is not dynamic. This implies that no additional degrees of freedom can be introduced, resulting
in the existence of physically impossible infinite tidal forces.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 23
1.6.1 f(R)Gravity and Its Extensions
One can generalize the Einstein-Hilbert action by substituting the Ricci scalar Rwith the generic
function f(R) as
S=1
2κZ
f(R)√−gd4x+Z
Lm√−gd4x. (1.52)
It is also immediate that GR is recovered at f(R) =R. To obtain the field equations of f(R)
gravity, we take into account the variation of action (1.52) with respect to the metric tensor,
which yields
f′(R)Rµν−f(R)
2gµν−(∇µ∇ν−gµν□)f′(R) = 8 πGTµν, (1.53)
where □=∇µ∇µis the D’Alembert operator, f′(R) =d f(R)
dR, and Tµνis the stress-energy-
momentum tensor defined in (1.15) . Models of dark energy based on f(R) theories have
been intensively studied as the simplest modified gravity scenario to account for the late time
acceleration. The model with f(R) =R+βR2(β >0) can cause the Universe to expand at
a faster rate due to the presence of R2term. This was the first inflation model proposed by
Starobinsky in 1980 [ 119]. Another model with f(R) =R−β
Rn, (β >0, n > 0) was proposed
for dark energy in the metric formulation [ 57,120]. However, it was demonstrated that this
model suffers from matter instability [ 121,122] and problems satisfying local gravity constraints
[123,124]. It lacks a conventional matter-dominated era due to a strong coupling between dark
energy and dark matter. These results demonstrate how challenging it is to construct reliable
models of dark energy.
Henceforth, the f(R) function should meet the following requirements [24, 25]
•To avoid ghost states, f(R)>0, for R≥R0, where R0is the present value of Ricci scalar.
•To avoid the existence of a scalar degree of freedom with negative mass, i.e. tachyons, we
should have fRR>0, for R≥R0.
•f(R)→R−2Λ, for R≥R0. This condition is needed for the presence of a matter-
dominated era and for agreement with the local gravity constraints.
•The condition for stability and late de-sitter limit of the Universe is given by 0 <RfRR
fR<1.
An intriguing extension of gravity is incorporating a non-minimal connection of geometry and
matter into the action via the arbitrary function of scalar curvature and Lagrangian density of
matter, i.e. f(R, L m) gravity or f(R,T) gravity, where Tis the trace of the energy-momentum
tensor. Another exciting feature of this theory is that the field equations of f(R,T) gravity
reduce to those of f(R) gravity when the energy-momentum tensor is assumed to be traceless,
orT= 0.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 24
The action in f(R,T) gravity is of the form [26]
S=1
2κZ
f(R,T)d4x√−g+Z
Lmd4x√−g. (1.54)
By varying the action (1.54) with respect to metric tensor, the gravitational field equations of
f(R,T) gravity is obtained as
fR(R,T)Rµν−1
2gµνf(R,T)+(gµν□− ∇ µ∇ν)fR(R,T) = 8 πGTµν−fT(R,T)Tµν−fT(R, T)Θµν,
(1.55)
where Θ µν=gσλδTσλ
δgµν,fR(R,T) =d f(R,T)
dR, and fT(R,T) =d f(R,T)
dT. In addition, f(R,T)
cosmology has been the subject of substantial research such as the dust fluid is shown to
reproduce ΛCDM, phantom, non-phantom era, Chaplygin gas and scalar field reconstruction,
energy conditions, and so on [31, 32, 125].
One can also write the covariant derivative of equation (1.54) as
∇µTµν=fT(R,T)
8πG−fT(R,T)
(Tµν+ Θ µν)∇µln fT(R,T) +∇µΘµν−1
2gµν∇µT
. (1.56)
This demonstrates that the energy-momentum tensor is not conserved in the f(R,T) theory.
Due to matter-energy coupling, a non-zero value of the covariant divergence of the stress-energy-
momentum tensor reflects an additional acceleration that causes massive test particles to follow
a non-geodesic motion [126].
1.6.2 Geometrical Representation
1.6.2.1 Geometrical Meaning of Curvature
We introduce the curvature tensor by considering the parallel displacement of a vector along two
distinct paths. Let us consider a parallelogram ABCD with infinitesimally small adjacent sides
AB=dxµandAD=δxµ. Consider a contravariant vector Vµ|Adefined at point Awhich is
parallelly transported as: first, displace vector Vµ|Aparallelly from point AtoBasVµ|B. Then,
proceed to displace vector Vµ|Bparallelly from point BtoC, resulting in the vector Vµ|CB.
Secondly, displace vector Vµ|Aparallelly from point AtoDasVµ|D. Then, proceed to displace
vector Vµ|Dparallelly from point DtoC, resulting in the vector Vµ|CD. Now, we can write the
vector Vµ|Bobtained by parallel displacement of Vµ|A
Vµ|B=Vµ|A+dVµ|A,where dVµ|A=−Γµ
νλ|AVν|Adxλ. (1.57)Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 25
Again, the same vector is parallelly displaced from BtoCas
Vµ|CB=Vµ|B+δVµ|B=Vµ|B−Γµ
hk|BVh|Bδxk. (1.58)
The connection or the Christoffel symbol depends on the metric tensor, which is a function of
coordinates. Hence, for a small displacement, we get
Γµ
hk|B= Γµ
hk|A+ Γµ
hk|A,mdxm,where Γµ

Next, replace hbyνandmbyλin the first two terms of the equation (1.62) on the right-hand
side and interchange λbykin the second and third terms. Hence, we obtain
Vµ|CD−Vµ|CB=Rµ
νλkVνdxkδxλ, (1.63)
where
Rµ
νλk= Γµ
νk,λ−Γµ
νλ,k+ Γµ

νk−Γµ

νλ. (1.64)
It could be deduced that in a non-Euclidean space, when a tensor is parallelly shifted along a
closed curve till returning to the initial point, the resultant vector may not necessarily be the
same as the original vector.
1.6.2.2 Geometrical Meaning of Torsion
Let us have a look at a simple example to see how the geometry of torsion works [ 128]. Consider
the curves C:yµ=yµ(λ) and ˜C: ˜yµ= ˜yµ(λ). The associated tangent vectors are
uµ=dyµ
dλ, and ˜uµ=d˜yµ
dλ. (1.65)Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 26
Assume that d˜yµrepresent a displacement of uβalong ˜Cand we get u′βas
u′β=uβ+ (∂µuβ)d˜yµ, (1.66)
but since uβis parallel transported along ˜C, then
d˜yµ
dλ˜∇µuβ= 0 =d˜yµ
dλ∂µuβ+˜Γβ
νµd˜yµ
dλuµ,
which means
∂µuβd˜yµ=−˜Γβ
νµuν˜uµdλ, (1.67)
Henceforth, (1.66) becomes
u′β=uβ−˜Γβ
νµuν˜uµdλ. (1.68)
Similarly, for a displacement dxµof ˜uβalong C, we obtain
˜u′β= ˜uβ−˜Γβ
νµ˜uµuνdλ, (1.69)
and
(˜uβ+u′β)−(uβ+ ˜u′β) =−Tβ
µν˜uµuνdλ. (1.70)
It is now apparent that the vectors ( ˜uβ+u′β) and ( uβ+˜u′β) are not identical in the presence
of torsion, which rules out the existence of the infinitesimal parallelogram. The latter can be
expressed as
˜Vβ=−Tβ
µν˜uµuν, (1.71)
where ˜Vβdλis the deviation vector, indicates how much the parallelogram has been broken.
Hence, the presence of torsion cracks parallelograms into pentagons.
1.6.2.3 Geometrical Meaning of Non-Metricity
Let us have a look at the geometry of non-metricity. Consider two vectors uµandvµon a
differential manifold with a metric and connection. We define an inner product of these vectors
asu.v=uµvνgµνand parallel transport both the vectors along a curve C:xµ=xµ(λ), we obtain
˜∇λ(u.v) =dxα
dλ
˜∇αuµ
vµ+dxα
dλ
˜∇αvν
uν+dxα
dλ
˜∇αgµν
uµvν. (1.72)
The condition of parallel transport of uµandvµresults in
dxα
dλ
˜∇αuµ
= 0, anddxα
dλ
˜∇αvµ
, (1.73)Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 27
and hence
˜∇λ(u.v) =Qαµνdxα
dλuµvν. (1.74)
This demonstrates that parallel transporting two vectors around a curve changes the inner
product. Equalizing the two vectors requires
˜∇λ(|u|2) =Qαµνdxα
dλuµuν, (1.75)
which shows how the length of the vector’s magnitude changes when we parallel transport it
along a given curve. Henceforth, the length of a vector changes when being transported in
parallel in a space with non-metricity.
Note: The most common combinations of three geometries are defined as
•The combination Rµ
νσλ̸= 0, Tβ
µν= 0, Qβµν= 0 with a Levi-Civita connection is known
as the GR spacetime.
•The combination Rµ

•The combination Rµ
νσλ≡0,Tβ
µν̸= 0, Qβµν≡0 gives the Torsional Teleparallelism.
•The combination Rµ
νσλ≡0,Tβ
µν≡0,Qβµν̸= 0 shows the non-metricity Teleparallelism.
•The combination Rµ
νσλ≡0,Tβ
µν≡0,Qβµν≡0 results in the Minkowski space. In this
case, the connection is fixed upto diffeomorphism and does not carry any gravitational
degrees of freedom.
The best strategy to further relax the Riemannian constraints is now evident from the above
discussion. In other words, a generic affine connection that allows for torsion and non-metricity
is required to reach the realm of non-Riemannian geometry. The generic affine connection
encompasses torsion and non-metricity degrees of freedom with ease. The affine connection can
be written as [127]

non-metricity teleparallel theories.
1.6.3 Teleparallel Equivalent to GR and its Extensions
GR expresses gravitation via the metric tensor and the torsion-free Levi-Civita connection.
Curvature is thus displayed through the connection rather than the metric itself. Teleparallel
gravity (TG) replaces the standard gravity connection with the Weitzenb¨ ock connection, which
is curvature-less and satisfies the metricity connection ( ∇αgµν= 0) [ 36]. In TG, the metric is a
derived quantity that emerges from the tetrad7. The curvature-less Weitzen¨ ock connection in
TG is defined by

Since the torsion scalar Tis only dependent on the first-order derivatives of the tetrads, this
theory is of the second order. One can review f(T) gravity in [37, 131–133].
In addition to an arbitrary function of the torsion scalar, f(T) gravity can be extended by
permitting an arbitrary function of both torsion Tand energy-momentum tensor T, such as
f(T,T) gravity. The action for f(T,T) gravity is given by [134]

1.6.4 Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to GR and its Extensions
This section will examine the theory of symmetric teleparallel equivalent to general relativity
(STEGR). GR is a metric theory in which the covariant derivative of the metric is zero. In the
meantime, non-metricity theories are derived from the non-metricity tensor, which is defined
below
Qαµν=∇αgµν. (1.88)
IfQαµν(Γ, g) = 0, we get a metric-compatible geometry. In non-metric theories, non-metricity
measures the amount by which the length of vectors varies when they are parallel transported.
Assuming the relationship in the equation (1.88) gives rise to non-metric theories such as
symmetric teleparallelism in which the non-metricity manifests as a flat torsion-free geometry. As
the equation (1.77) demonstrates, we can derive the disformation tensor from the non-metricity
tensor, which measures the Levi-Civita connection’s deviation from the symmetric part of the
entire connection.
It is useful to introduce the non-metricity conjugate, which is defined as

(µQν), (1.89)Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 30
where Qα=gµνQαµνand ˜Qα=gµνQµανare the two independent traces. Henceforth, one can
define the non-metricity scalar as Q=−QαµνPαµν.
The action for STEGR is
S=−1
2κZ
Q√−g d4x+Z
Lm√−g d4x. (1.90)
It is important to note that the difference between the invariant Qand the Ricci scalar is a
boundary term. The theory described by Q, in which there is no boundary term, is a type of
special STG analogous to an enhanced version of GR. The connection between tangent space and
spacetime is entirely trivial and represents a much more straightforward geometric interpretation
of gravity; the origins of tangent space and spacetime coincide. This theory is known as coincident
GR, i.e., STEGR [42].
We can also extend STEGR by considering an action defined by an arbitrary function f(Q) as
S=−1
2κZ
f(Q)√−g d4x+Z
Lm√−g d4x. (1.91)
Motivating a specific choice of non-metricity scalar and the preceding action is the replication
of GR for the choice f(Q) =Q. The variational principle with respect to gµνyields the field

Broadly speaking, there are two distinct phases. Firstly, it is essential to establish a comprehensive
understanding of the model. Ideally, this model should exhibit a high degree of simplicity.
Furthermore, once the model has been determined, we utilize our data to quantify the valuesChapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 31
of the parameters. The forthcoming section provides an overview of diverse observational
methodologies.
1.7 Cosmological Observations
This section will introduce fundamental statistical concepts. In cosmological reconstruction,
the best-fit parameter values can be derived through either statistical methods: minimizing
the function through optimization or maximizing the likelihood function via marginalization.
An alternative is to conduct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which uses a
marginalization of the posterior probability distribution over the parameter space to derive
constraints on the parameter values.
1.7.1 Basics of Statistics
1.7.1.1 χ2Minimization
Based on observational data, the χ2statistic has been extensively used to estimate the parameters
of theoretical models. If we assume an observational data ( zi, fi) with a standard deviation σi,
an experimentally measured value fiobs, and a theoretically anticipated value fith, then the χ2is
defined as
χ2=X
i[fiobs−fith({θ})]2
σ2
i, (1.95)
where {θ}denotes the set of model parameters.
If the fi’s are related to each other, then the χ2function can be defined as
χ2=X
i,j[fiobs−fith({θ})]Tr(Cov−1)ij
fjobs−fjth({θ})
, (1.96)
where Trrepresents the transpose of the matrix, ( Cov−1)ijis a covariance matrix needed to
characterize the errors of the data.
To acquire the parameters of the best-fitting model, we must minimize the χ2function. We
define another quantity, which is the reduced χ2
redgiven by the expression
χ2
red=χ2
d, (1.97)
where dsignifies the degrees of freedom. The necessary condition that needs to be checked for
presenting any over-fitting is χ2
red<1. Moreover, one can determine ∆ χ2=χ2−χ2
minfor 1σ
(68%), 2 σ(95%), and 3 σ(99%) confidence level ranges of a specific model.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 32
1.7.1.2 Maximum Likelihood Analysis
According to Baye’s theorem, the posterior probability distribution of parameters {θ}is obtained
as
P({θ}/D, I) =P({θ}/I)P(D/{θ}, I)
P(D/I), (1.98)
where Irepresents the prior information and Dis the observational data. P({θ}/I)gives the
prior probabilities and P(D/{θ}, I)is the probability of obtaining Dif{θ}is given referenced
toI, also known as the likelihood L. Further, P(D/I)is the global likelihood which serves as a
normalization factor
P(D/I) =Z
θ1.....Z
θnP({θ}/I)P(D/{θ}, I)dθ1....dθ n, (1.99)
such that Z
θ1.....Z
θnP({θ}/D, I)dθ1....dθ n= 1. (1.100)
The likelihood Lis related to χ2function defined as
L({θ}) =exp
−χ2
2
. (1.101)
Thus, one can note that the minimized value of χ2corresponds to the maximized likelihood
function L. Using the MCMC approach, we sample the posterior probability distribution
throughout the parameter space to determine the best-fit parameter values and associated error
uncertainties. Using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm provides a more effective means
of exploring parameter space through random walks from one set of parameter values to the
next. The MH rule assesses whether or not a given set of random walks should be accepted
by comparing the likelihood of the new and old sets of parameter values. When a fit to the
data is optimal, the algorithm is more inclined towards the regions with the highest likelihood.
The shape of Laround the maximum is then explored as it wanders around that area of the
parameter space. This investigation maps out the posterior probability of each parameter value
by maximizing the marginal likelihood function, also known as the integrated likelihood, which
results in the marginalized constraints in the parameter space. As a result, the MCMC analysis is
comparable to the minimization, where the parameters are marginalized rather than optimized.
1.7.2 Observational data
Cosmological observations have been crucial in understanding the history of the expansion of the
Universe. We shall briefly review several cosmological findings in the search for cosmic evolution.Chapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 33
1.7.2.1 Hubble Measurements
The H(z) dataset provides strong evidence for the fine structure of the expansion history of the
Universe. Direct measurements of H(z) at different redshifts, based on the ages of the most
massive and passively evolving galaxies, generate another standard probe in cosmology. Notably,
H(z) measurements are derived from two distinct techniques: galaxy differential age (also known
as cosmic chronometer) and radial baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) size methodologies [ 143].
The authors of [ 135,136] present 13 H(z) values derived from the BC03 and MaStro SPS models
[137], which we will refer to as the CCB compilation and the CCM compilation, respectively.
The authors of [ 138,139] provide only 5 H(z) values obtained using the BC03 model; these values
have been added to the CCB compilation. In the case of [ 140], the combined MaStro/BC03
values for 2 H(z) measurements are available. In [ 141], an alternative SPS, distinct from the
MaStro and BC03 models, is presumed to consist of 11 H(z) values and is subsequently referred
to as the CCH compilation and the other 26 points assessed using BAO [142].
1.7.2.2 Type Ia Supernovae
When a white dwarf star explodes, it causes a tremendous explosion in a large-scale structure
known as a Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa). An explosion occurs when a white dwarf star approaches
the Chandrasekhar mass limit after gaining mass from a companion star. Therefore, SNeIa can
be used as a standard candle to measure the luminosity distance. In 1998, Riess et al. [ 14]
discovered the accelerated expansion of the Universe using 16 distant and 34 nearby SNeIa
from the Hubble telescope observations. In 1999, Perlmutter et al. [ 15] confirmed the cosmic
acceleration by analyzing 18 nearby supernovae (SNe) from the Calan-Tololo sample and 42-
high-redshift SNe. Many research groups have focused on this field, such as the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) SNe Survey [ 144], the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) [ 145],
the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) [ 146], the Nearby Supernova Factory (NSF) [ 147], the
Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) [ 148], and the Higher-Z Team [ 149], etc. Moreover, recently the
Union 2.1 SNeIa dataset, consisting of 580 SNeIa was released [ 150]. The Pantheon compilation
is one of the most up-to-date compilations of data on type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), which contains
1048 points in the redshift range 0 .01< z < 2.26 [151].
1.7.2.3 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations refer to the aggregation or overdensity of baryonic matter at
specific length scales caused by acoustic waves propagating in the early universe [ 152]. Similar
to SNeIa, BAO provides a standard candle for length sales in cosmology, which enables us to
investigate the expansion history of the Universe. On the matter power spectrum, BAO leavesChapter 1. Introduction and Theoretical Background 34
a distinctive imprint. Consequently, astronomical surveys of galaxy clusters allow for their
measurement at low redshifts ( z <1) [153]. In addition, BAO scales can also be measured
through reionization emission, which provides extensive information regarding the early Universe
at high redshifts (1 .5≤z≤20) [154]. The Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance
can be calculated using the apparent magnitude of the BAO as determined by astronomical
observations. Numerous investigations have been conducted for BAO measurements, including
the Two-degree-Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) [ 155], the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) [ 156], etc. SDSS is the most successful survey for BAO observation, releasing its eighth
data continuously in 2011 [157].
The following chapters employ the modified gravity theories we have been discussing to some
specific challenges with the above observational data.Chapter 2
Effective Equation of State in
Modified Gravity and Observational
Constraints
The current chapter presents the effective equation of state (EoS) in modified f(R,T) gravity.
The detailed study of the work is outlined as follows:
•We consider an effective equation of state with bulk viscosity to study the cosmological
evolution of the Universe.
•The present study aims to derive the Hubble parameter and deceleration parameter in
terms of redshift zto explain the late time accelerating phase. In order to distinguish the
present model from other dark energy models, we also present the statefinder and Om(z)
diagnostics analyses.
•We eventually provide constraints on the cosmological parameters of our model using 580
points of Type Ia Supernovae (Union 2.1) and the updated version of 57 Hubble datasets.
2.1 Introduction
Viscosity : The ΛCDM model has received significant attention since it can explain most
observations despite its inability to describe the accurate physics of DM and DE. Although
*The work in this chapter is covered by the following publication:

205022 (2020).
35Chapter 2. Effective Equation of State in Modified Gravity and Observational Constraints 36
the ΛCDM model agrees with a wide range of experimental data, there exists a substantial
phenomenological gap. The two primary issues are the coincidence problem and fine-tuning
problem. These issues have prompted the development of numerous dark energy models, including
quintessence, perfect fluid models, and scalar fields. In addition, many authors have asserted that
cosmic viscosity regulates late time accelerated expansion. The viscosity theories in cosmology
are significant in relation to the early Universe when the temperature was approximately 104K
(during the neutrino split). In the cosmic fluid, there are two different viscosity coefficients:
bulk viscosity and shear viscosity. Due to the accepted spatial isotropy of the Universe, such as
the Robertson-Walker metric descriptions, we omit shear viscosity. By contemplating a bulk
viscous fluid, the issue of identifying a viable mechanism for the origin of bulk viscosity in an
expanding Universe is addressed. Physically, bulk viscosity is viewed as an internal friction
resulting from various cooling rates in an expanding matter. By converting the kinetic energy
of the particles into heat, its dissipation reduces the effective pressure in an expanding fluid
[159]. The existence of viscosity parameters in a fluid is fundamentally attributable to the
thermodynamic irreversibility of the motion. If the deviation from reversibility is small, it can
be assumed that the momentum shift between various parts of the fluid is linearly dependent on
the velocity derivatives. This condition corresponds to the paradigm of constant viscosity. When
the viscosity is proportional to the Hubble parameter, on the other hand, the momentum shift
entails second-order quantities in the deviation from reversibility, resulting in more intriguing
physical outcomes. Consequently, the correct selection of their coefficients may result in crossing
the phantom divide line [ 160]. Other studies indicate that the bulk viscosity is sufficient to drive
the cosmic fluid from the quintessence to the phantom region. Sharif and Yousaf [ 161] have also
investigated stability regions for a non-static restricted class of axially symmetric geometries.
Their work includes shearing viscous fluid that collapses non-adiabatically.
Viscosity in modified gravity: If we consider the problem of cosmic adaptation, i.e., the
average stage of low redshift, one can justify the accelerating expansion of the Universe by
modifying Einstein equations geometrically. Bulk viscosity can also produce acceleration without
a scalar field or cosmological constant if connected to inflation. The bulk viscosity contributes
to the pressure term and exerts an additional pressure that accelerates the expansion of the
Universe [ 162]. Most arguments for standard gravity presume that the fluid of the Universe is
perfect and non-viscous. From the standpoint of hydrodynamics, the two viscosity coefficients
discussed above enter into play, which indicate a first-order deviation from thermal equilibrium.
Thus, this supports Eckart’s approach [ 158] from 1940 due to its non-causal behavior. Therefore,
taking second-order deviations from a thermal equilibrium leads to a causal theory respecting
special relativity. Now, it is also essential to consider more realistic models, which process due
to complex viscosity, for example, research in [ 163] studied the role of bulk viscosity in the
evolution of the Universe using a modified f(R,T) gravity model. In addition, many authors
have investigated the concept of bulk viscous fluid to explain the accelerating expansion of theChapter 2. Effective Equation of State in Modified Gravity and Observational Constraints 37
Universe [ 165–167]. Davood [ 168] also investigated the role of bulk viscosity in f(T) gravity.
Eckart originally proposed the form of cosmic pressure p= (γ−1)ρ−3ζH, where γparametrizes
the EoS parameter [ 169]. However, Eckart’s theory undergoes some anomalies. One of those
is the instability of the equilibrium states [ 170]. Also, dissipative perturbations propagate at
infinite velocities [ 171]. In 1979, Israel and Stewart [ 172] developed a more general theory that
was causal and stable. The first-order limit of Stewart’s viewpoint can also be used to develop
the Eckart theory [ 173]. Fisher and Carlson [ 32] examined the form f(R,T) =f1(R) +f2(T), in
which they state that f(R,T) yields a new physics and limits could be placed on the cross-terms
by comparing them to observations. Harko and Moreas [ 174] revised their work to investigate
observational constraints on the function f2(T). The impact of viscosity on the finite-time future
singularities in f(T) gravity has been studied by Setare and Houndjo [ 175]. Sharif and Rani [ 176]
have also studied dark energy viscosity in f(T) gravity. Viscosity in f(R) gravity is discussed by
Brevik [177].
The plan of this chapter is to study the FLRW model with bulk viscosity effects in the modified
f(R,T) gravity theory with a general effective equation of state p= (γ−1)ρ+p0+ωHH+
ωH2H2+ωdH˙H. This chapter is divided into different sections. In section 2.2, we introduce the
field equations with bulk viscosity. Then, we describe the general solution and the behavior of
various cosmological parameters in section 2.3. In section 2.4, we conduct numerous tests to
validate the model, which includes the energy conditions, statefinder, and Om(z) diagnostics. To
study all the cosmological parameters, we obtain the best-fit values of model parameters using
the observational datasets H(z), SNeIa, and BAO in section 2.5. The final section 2.6 presents
the conclusion.
2.2 Field Equations
Let us consider a FLRW metric in the flat space geometry ( k= 0) by
ds2=dt2−a2(t)[dr2+r2dθ2+r2sin2θdϕ2], (2.1)
with the four-velocity uµ=(1,0,0,0)and the cosmic fluid along with a bulk viscosity ζ. So, one
can rewrite the energy-momentum tensor for a viscous fluid as follows
Tµν=ρ uµuν−p hµν, (2.2)
where hµν=gµν+uµuνand the effective pressure is p=p−3ζ H. If we choose the Lagrangian
density as Lm=−p, then the tensor Θ µνcan be written as
Θµν=−2Tµν−p gµν. (2.3)Chapter 2. Effective Equation of State in Modified Gravity and Observational Constraints 38
Now, remembering the field equation (1.55) off(R,T), we shall find the field equation for the
bulk viscous fluid using equations (2.2),(2.3) and the functional form f(R,T) =R+ 2f(T)

2R gµν=Tµν+ 2f′(T)Tµν+ (2p f′(T) +f(T))gµν. (2.4)
For the particular choice of the function f(T) =ηT,ηas a constant and R= 6(2 H2+˙H), one
can obtain the following Friedmann equations
3H2=ρ+ 2η(ρ+p) +ηT, (2.5)
and
2˙H+ 3H2=−p+ηT, (2.6)
where T=ρ−3p. It can be noted that the field equations reduce to general relativity for η= 0
(ηis the coupling constant for modified gravity). Finally, we combine equations (2.5) and (2.6)
to get a single equation as follows
2˙H+ (1 + 2 η)(p+ρ)−3(1 + 2 η)ζH= 0. (2.7)
2.3 General Solution
The equations (2.5) and(2.6) contain four unknown parameters, namely ρ,p,ζ&H. To obtain
an exact solution from the equations, we need two more physically viable equations. As stated
in the introduction, we will consider the subsequent EoS (as given in the explicit form in [ 169])
p= (γ−1)ρ+p0+ωHH+ωH2H2+ωdH˙H, (2.8)
where p0, ωH, ωH2, ωdHare free parameters. In this chapter, we assume that the Universe is
filled with a single fluid described by the above defined EoS. Next, we shall make use of the
following form of the time-dependent bulk viscosity
ζ=ζ0+ζ1˙a
a+ζ2¨a
˙a, (2.9)
to check that this form is effectively equivalent to the form derived by equation (2.8), where
ζ0, ζ1, ζ2are constants. The justification behind this is as follows
p=p−3ζH=p−3
ζ0+ζ1˙a
a+ζ2¨a
˙a
H,
=p−3ζ0H−3ζ1H2−3ζ2(˙H+H2),Chapter 2. Effective Equation of State in Modified Gravity and Observational Constraints 39
which gives
p=p−3ζ0H−3(ζ1+ζ2)H2−3ζ2˙H. (2.10)
Hence, one can write the corresponding coefficients for the simplicity by
ωH=−3ζ0,
ωH2=−3(ζ1+ζ2),
ωdH=−3ζ2.
According to the work done in the literature, it is important to mention that the expression for
bulk viscosity ζ=ζ0+ζ1Hindicates that the expansion of scale factor deviates more rapidly
from the expansion rate of a perfect fluid for larger bulk viscosity coefficient. Furthermore, for
ζ= 0 and ζ=ζ1H, the scale factor exhibits a power-law dependence on cosmic time, and the
values of qremain constant [163].
The motivation behind investigating the general form of bulk viscosity emerges from the un-
derstanding in fluid mechanics that the transport and viscosity phenomenon are intricately
connected to the concept of velocity. This velocity, in turn, is associated with the Hubble
parameter and acceleration. Given the lack of precise knowledge regarding the specific nature of
viscosity, we opt to examine a parameterized bulk viscosity that can be expressed as a linear
combination of three distinct factors. The initial term in the equation represents a constant
value denoted by ζ0. The second term is directly proportional to the Hubble parameter, which
characterizes the relationship between bulk viscosity and velocity. Lastly, the third term is
proportional to¨a
˙a, representing the impact of acceleration on bulk viscosity.
Combining equations (2.5), (2.8), and (2.9), we obtain the explicit form of energy density
ρ=η p0+ 2η ωHH+ (2η ωH2+ 3)H2+ 2η ωdH˙H
1 + 4 η−η γ. (2.11)
Subsequently, the bulk viscous pressure using equation (2.6) is obtained as
p=η2p0+ 2η2ωHH+ (2η2ωH2−9η−3 + 3 η γ)H2+ (2η2ωdH−2(1 + 4 η−η γ))˙H
(1 + 4 η−η γ)(1 + 3 η).(2.12)
Finally, we get the following differential equation using equations (2.7), (2.8), (2.12). That is

2 +2(1 + 2 η)ωdH(1 + 4 η)
1 + 4 η−ηγ

We notice that the above equation is highly non-linear, so without loss of generality, we assume
p0= 0. As a result, the equation becomes simple and the time evolution of the Hubble parameterChapter 2. Effective Equation of State in Modified Gravity and Observational Constraints 40

where k4is the constant of integration.
Next, we make substitutions from the above equation of scale factor to obtain the deceleration
parameter ( q=−a¨a
˙a2) given by
q=−1 +k1ek1t. (2.16)
The solution set for the formulated system is now readily accessible. The present work aims
to examine the dynamics of different cosmological parameters to understand the evolutionary
trajectory of the Universe better. Our objective is to investigate the numerous phases of the
Universe by imposing constraints on the model parameters, focusing on the transition from a
decelerated phase to an accelerated phase. It is understood that a positive value of the parameter
qis associated with the decelerating phase of the Universe, whereas a negative value signifies its
accelerating behaviour. As a result, we shall present all cosmological parameters by utilizing the
redshift zas a reference, as per the established relation, that is
a(t) =1
1 +z, (2.17)
with a0=a(z= 0) = 1. The Hubble parameter and deceleration parameter are two observable
parameters that can be rewritten in terms of redshift as

and
q(z) =−1 +k2(k4+k4z)k2
(k4+k4z)k2−1. (2.19)
According to a recent study by [ 178], it has been shown that the present deceleration parameter,
denoted by q0is estimated to be q0=−0.51+0.09
−0.01. Moreover, the transition redshift from
deceleration to acceleration is obtained as zt= 0.65+0.19
−0.17[179]. The transition of the Universe
from a decelerated phase to an accelerated phase at zt≈0.7 has been depicted in several
studies [ 180–183]. Henceforth, in the current model, we have selected specific values of the free
parameters ( k1,k2,k4) in order to ensure that our q0andztvalues are consistent with values
reported in the existing literature. In this discourse, we shall examine a particular model as an
illustration and study the cosmic history of the Universe by employing a set of numerical choicesChapter 2. Effective Equation of State in Modified Gravity and Observational Constraints 41

of the values of these model parameters. To be specific, we assumed two parameters γandη
according to the works done previously and found the other parameters using the equations of k1,
k2andk3. Nevertheless, we have taken the values of k2andk4that observational datasets have
constrained in the further section. Figure 2.1 illustrates the evolution of q(z) with a suitable
choice of the model parameters. It is observed that the deceleration parameter qundergoes a
transition from positive to negative at zt= 0.84 and zt= 0.62. The corresponding values of
q0, i.e. at present, are found to be with q0=−0.78 and q0=−0.68 for two different values of
k4=−0.43 and k4=−0.49, respectively. This observation suggests that the Universe exhibits a
transition from early deceleration to the current acceleration in the framework of this model.

function of the redshift parameter z, whereas the effective pressure now demonstrates a negative
behavior, implying the Universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion.
The EoS parameter is employed to categorize the different phases of the Universe, distinguishing
between the decelerating and accelerating eras. It assigns numerous epochs into several classifi-
cations as outlined: when ω= 1, it signifies the presence of stiff fluid. If ω= 1/3, the model
depicts a radiation-dominated phase while ω= 0 represents a matter-dominated phase. In the
present accelerated stage of evolution, −1< ω < 0 indicates the quintessence phase, ω=−1
represents the cosmological constant, i.e., ΛCDM model, and ω <−1 yields the phantom era. In
figure 2.3, the plot displays the EoS parameter versus redshift z, utilising the identical model
parameter values as previously described.
The graph in figure 2.3 shows that as z→ −1,ω→ −1 in the future. This also illustrates a
transition from positive to negative in due course of evolution. It signifies the earlier decelerating
phase of the Universe with positive pressure, which is favourable to the structure formation.
Subsequently, it indicates the present accelerating phase of the evolution characterized by negative
pressure. It is clear that the present model does not cross the phantom divide line, thereby
ensuring that the model is free from Big Rip singularity. The present values of the EoS parameter
is obtained as ω0=−0.88 for k4=−0.43 and ω0=−0.84 for k4=−0.49 together with the
stated values of other model parameters. In the following section, we will discuss cosmological
diagnostics and observational datasets.

Next, we present various energy conditions as mentioned in section 1.4.5. The violation of
NEC implies that none of the mentioned ECs are validated. The SEC is currently a subject
of much discussion for the current accelerated expansion of the Universe [ 184,185]. SEC must
be violated in cosmological scenarios both during the inflationary expansion and in the current
epoch. The graph of these energy conditions is depicted in figure 2.4. The analysis focused onChapter 2. Effective Equation of State in Modified Gravity and Observational Constraints 43

2.4 Tests for validation of the Model
There are some theoretical and observational tests to check the validity of any cosmological
model. In this discussion, we will examine some cosmological tests that might be employed to
authenticate the validity of our derived model.
2.4.1 Statefinder Diagnostic
In order to distinguish our model from a variety of existing dark energy models, it is possible to
introduce a set of parameters known as statefinder pairs [186–188]
r=...a
aH3, (2.20)
s=r−1
3(q−1/2), q̸=1
2. (2.21)
For the sake of simplicity, we could redefine the statefinder pair {r, s}fully in terms of the
deceleration parameter
r(z) = q(z)(1 + 2 q(z)) +q′(z)(1 + z), (2.22)
s(z) =r(z)−1

ωdH=−0.1,k4=−0.43,−0.49.
We will proceed with the construction of the phase plane denoted as r−sandr−q, where
distinct points on the plane represent different states of the Universe, adhering to the following
conditions:
•ΛCDM corresponds to ( s= 0, r= 1),
•Chaplygin gas (CG) corresponds to ( s <0, r > 1),
•Standard cold dark matter (SCDM) corresponds to ( r= 1, q= 0.5),
•Quintessence corresponds to ( s >0, r < 1).
The analysis focuses on investigating the departure of any dark energy model from the specified
coordinates in the r−sandr−qplanes. The plot below depicts statefinder pairs of the model
we have developed. So the present model resembles the ΛCDM model in the future. The r−s
plane trajectories of the model are depicted in figure 2.5. The trajectories in the r−splane are
confined to the region r >1, s < 0, akin to the generalized Chaplygin gas model of dark energy
as described in [ 189]. It is noted that the model will reach ΛCDM and may lie in quintessence
at late times. The present position of the bulk viscous model in the r−splane corresponds to
{1.04,−0.013}and{1.09,−0.02}fork4=−0.43 and k4=−0.49. The present model can also
be differentiated from the holographic dark energy model with event horizon as the infrared
cutoff, in which the r−sevolution starts from a region r∼1,s∼2/3 and terminates at the
ΛCDM point [ 190]. This observation suggests that the current model exhibits notable differences
when compared to the ΛCDM model. The central solid line within the r−qplane highlights
the trajectory of the ΛCDM Universe, effectively bisecting the plane. The upper region is
representative of the Chaplygin gas model, while the lower area corresponds to the QuintessenceChapter 2. Effective Equation of State in Modified Gravity and Observational Constraints 45
model. In a similar fashion, the plot on the right in figure 2.5 illustrates the convergence of
our model towards the de-Sitter point ( q=−1, r= 1) while also exhibiting deviations from the
SCDM model.
2.4.2 Om(z)Diagnostic
In the following section, we will analyze the Omdiagnostic denoted as Om(z). This diagnostic
tool distinguishes the standard ΛCDM model from other dark energy models such as quintessence
and phantom. The study of the Om(z) diagnostic mainly relies on the utilization of first-order
derivatives, as it encompasses the Hubble parameter. In reference with Sahni et al. [ 186–188],
Om(z) for a flat Universe is defined as
Om(z) =
H(z)
H02
−1
(1 +z)3−1. (2.24)
According to the definition, we obtain Om(z) for our model as
Om(z) =((k4z+k4)k2−1)2

kk2
4−12−1
(z+ 1)3−1. (2.25)
Thus, we have different values of Om(z) for the ΛCDM, phantom and quintessence cosmological
models. The behavior of dark energy may be categorized into three types: quintessence,
phantom, and ΛCDM. The quintessence type, characterized by ω >−1, is associated with
negative curvature. The phantom type, described by ω <−1, corresponds to positive curvature,
and lastly, the Om(z)=ΛCDM is associated with zero curvature.

The authors in [ 191] have presented a parametrization of Om(z) that allows the examination
of the compatibility or discrepancy between the ΛCDM and observations by using the latestChapter 2. Effective Equation of State in Modified Gravity and Observational Constraints 46
and enhanced observations of H(z) and SNeIa. The behavior can be easily seen in figure 2.6,
illustrating that the growth of Om(z) at later stages tends to support the viability of decaying
dark energy models (quintessence dark energy at late time) as discussed in [192].
2.5 Observational Constraints
A variety of observational datasets are currently available, as discussed in the section 1.7.2.
To assess the feasibility of our acquired model, we shall evaluate its performance using these
datasets. Here, we consider 57 points of H(z) data, of which 31 points are derived from the
differential age method and 26 points are from BAO and other methods [ 142] (given in the
appendix). Secondly, we consider 580 points of type Ia Supernovae corresponding to Union 2 .1
compilation dataset [ 193,194] (https://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/) to achieve our objective of
determining the best-fit values of the model parameters and comparing them to the ΛCDM
model.
2.5.1 Fitting the Model with H(z) & SNeIa Datasets
First, let us initiate a discussion regarding the Hubble data. The Hubble rate is usually defined
by the following formula
H(z) =−1
1 +zdz
dt. (2.26)
The ratio dz/dt can be obtained by calculating the ratio ∆ z/∆t, where ∆ zis the redshift
separation in the galaxy sample. This value can be estimated with a high value of precision and
accuracy using spectroscopic techniques. However, the determination of the value of ∆ tis much
more challenging and requires some standard clocks. For that purpose, it is possible to utilize
massive, passively evolving, and old stellar populations that are present across a wide range of
redshifts and therefore could be considered as cosmic chronometers [ 140,143]. Now, we shall
define the χ2function for the H(z) dataset by
χ2
H=NHX
i=1[Hobs(θ, zi)−Hth(zi)]2
σ(zi)2, (2.27)
where HobsandHthare the observed and theoretical values of H,θis the parameter space, σ(zi)
is the standard error in the measured value of H, and NHis the number of data points. The
plot displayed in figure 2.7 exhibits a significant relationship between the H(z) dataset and the
model parameter values, indicating a favourable match. This fit is then compared to the ΛCDM
model. For our computation, we choose a value of H0= 67.8km/s/Mpc as given by Planck2015
[16].Chapter 2. Effective Equation of State in Modified Gravity and Observational Constraints 47

Figure 2.7: The plot shows 57 points of the H(z) dataset (green dots) with corresponding error

Next we define the corresponding chi-square function for SNeIa as

where ∆ µi=µth(θ, zi)−µobs(zi), and µobs,µth,σµ(zi), denote the observed and theoretical

And the distance moduli is expressed as follows

It is widely acknowledged that the spatial curvature of our Universe is flat, resulting in a value
of Ω K= 0. The χ2
SNfunction and the distance DL(z) are calculated in order to quantify the
differences between the SNeIa observational data and predictions made by our model. The plot
presented in figure 2.8 shows a nice fit to the SNeIa dataset with suitable model parameter

2.5.2 Estimation of Model Parameters with H(z), SNeIa & BAO Datasets
Here, in this subsection, we shall find the constraints with the above discussed datasets i.e. H(z)
and SNeIa together with one more external dataset, the BAO dataset for our analysis. From very
large scales, BAO measures the structures in the Universe. In this chapter, we have considered
a sample of BAO distance measurements from surveys of SDSS(R) [ 195], 6dF Galaxy survey
[196], BOSS CMASS [ 197] and WiggleZ [ 198]. So, the distance redshift ratio dzis expressed as
dz=rs(z∗)
Dv(z), where rs(z∗) is the comoving sound horizon at the time photons decouple and z∗
is the photon decoupling redshift. In accordance to Planck 2015 results [ 16], the value of z∗is
determined to be 1090. We have taken rs(z∗) as considered in [ 199]. Also, dilation scale Dv(z)
is given by Dv(z) = d2
B(z)z

3, where dA(z) is the angular diameter distance. The chi-square
value for BAO measurements is written as [200]

Using the three samples of datasets, we have determined the likelihood contours for the model
parameters k2andk4at 1σ, 2σand 3 σconfidence levels. These contours are displayed in figures
2.9 and 2.10, representing the k2-k4plane. We have found constraints with the independent
H(z) dataset and combined H(z)+SNeIa+BAO dataset. The best estimated values of the model
parameters k2andk4are found to be k2= 3, k4=−0.4389 and k2= 3, k4=−0.43374,
respectively for independent H(z) datasets and joint H(z)+SNeIa+BAO datasets. The values
obtained for both the H(z) as well as joint data are almost identical. So, we have considered the
second value of k4in the neighbourhood, that is k4=−0.49.
2.6 Conclusions
The present chapter analyzed a cosmological model that describes the phenomenon of cosmic
acceleration through a viscous fluid. The dynamical equation of the Hubble parameter can be
entirely integrated using the effective viscosity equation of state (EoS). This integration leads to
an exact solution for Einstein’s field equation in the FLRW background for modified f(R,T)
gravity. Without introducing a cosmological constant or dark energy, the effective EoS (pressure
with added bulk viscosity) characterizes the late-time acceleration of the Universe.
In section 2.3, the deceleration parameter demonstrated a transition from early deceleration to
present acceleration at zt= 0.84 and zt= 0.62 for different values of k4=−0.43 and k4=−0.49,
respectively. Additionally, the corresponding values of the current deceleration parameter are
q0=−0.78 and q0=−0.62, which is depicted in figure 2.1. Figure 2.3 illustrated the evolution
of effective equation of state ωspecifically ω0=−0.88 for k4=−0.43 and ω0=−0.84 for
k4=−0.49. The cosmological model under consideration continues within the quintessence
phase, characterized by a value of the equation of state parameter ωthat does not cross the
phantom line ω=−1. Furthermore, in the future, the model approaches a value of ωequal to
−1, resulting in the emergence of the Einstein-de-Sitter space.
It is also important to note that the EoS parameter ωundergoes a transition from a positive
regime in the past to a negative regime in the present, implying that the incorporation of a bulk
viscous pressure term is crucial for achieving a decelerated expansion in the past (suitable for
structure formation) and an accelerated expansion in the present. This is depicted in figure
2.3, demonstrating that standard cosmology confirms the existence of the latter regime when
ω <−1
3. In section 2.4, we have discussed some physical properties of the model, the evolution
of cosmological parameters, and energy conditions. It has been noticed that NEC and DEC do
not violate their conditions, whereas SEC is violated, resulting in a repulsive force that causes
the Universe to accelerate. The violation of SEC depicted in figure 2.4 demonstrates the viability
of our model, as described in [ 184]. In addition, statefinder parameter analysis and Om(z)
diagnostic have been performed and compared to the ΛCDM model. It has been observed thatChapter 2. Effective Equation of State in Modified Gravity and Observational Constraints 51
the model will converge to the ΛCDM model in the distant future but exhibits deviations from
it in the present. We have conducted model fitting utilizing the updated 57 points of Hubble,
580 points of Union 2 .1 compilation supernovae, and the BAO datasets in section 2.5.
ECs have provided us with unique insights into the spacetime evolution processes underlying the
spacetime structure. The NEC and DEC are satisfied in the current paradigm, but the SEC is
violated due to cosmic acceleration. As it is known, the formation of wormholes necessitates
the explicit violation of the null energy condition, which compels us to investigate further the
confrontation of dark energy with an unusual spacetime structure. With this effective viscosity
EoS in non-minimally coupled gravity, additional research can be conducted. However, the
model addressed in the present chapter may also offer an alternative approach that could provide
some insights into the physical interpretation of the theories with curvature-matter coupling and
for observationally testing alternative gravity theories.
In the following two chapters, we will assess the validity of f(Q,T) gravity in a cosmological
context by utilizing advanced and latest observational datasets.Chapter 3
f(Q,T)Gravity Models with
Observational Constraints
This chapter presents the cosmology of late time in f(Q,T) gravity, where dark energy is purely
geometric. The detailed study of the work is outlined as:
•We begin by utilizing a well-motivated f(Q,T) gravity model with f(Q,T) =ξ Qn+bT
where ξ,nandbare model parameters.
•In addition, we assume that the Universe is dominated by pressure-less matter, resulting
in a power-law scale factor.
•We use the 580 points from the Union 2.1 compilation supernovae dataset and the revised
57 points from the Hubble dataset to constrain the model parameters to test the model’s
cosmological viability.
•We investigate the nature of geometrical dark energy modeled by the parametrization of
f(Q,T) =ξ Qn+bTusing the statefinder diagnostic in r−sandr−qplanes, as well as
theOm(z) diagnostic analysis.
3.1 Introduction
Extended theories of gravity such as f(R) gravity, f(G) gravity, f(R,T) gravity, etc. are widely
employed in modern cosmology (For a recent review on modified gravity see [ 201]). Also see

52Chapter 3. f(Q,T)Gravity Models with Observational Constraints 53
[202] for some interesting cosmological applications of modified gravity to address the late-
time acceleration and other shortcomings of ΛCDM cosmologies. f(Q,T) gravity is a recently
proposed extended theory of gravity in which the Lagrangian density of the gravitational field
is a function of the non-metricity Qand the trace of energy-momentum tensor T[54]. A very
recent study by Yixin et al. [ 116] demonstrates the non-minimal coupling between QandT
taking into account a variety of cosmological models with specific functional forms of f(Q,T).
Different forms of f(Q,T) can result in obtaining a large variety of cosmological evolution,
including the decelerating and accelerating expansion. Also, according to the study in [ 203],
f(Q,T) gravity yields an excellent theoretical estimate of baryon-to-entropy ratios and therefore,
could solve the puzzle of over-abundance of matter over anti-matter. With that in mind, we
intend to investigate the cosmological viability of f(Q,T) gravity in sufficing the conundrum of
late-time acceleration without incorporating dark energy.
The present chapter is organized as follows: In section 3.2, a concise overview of f(Q,T) is
presented. In the very next section 3.3, we discuss the cosmological model in f(Q,T) framework
and derive some necessary cosmological parameters. In accordance, the non-parametric method
is sometimes more beneficial, as the evolution of our Universe can be found directly from the
observational data. Thus, in section 3.4, we constrain the model parameters using H(z) and
SNeIa datasets. We present geometrical diagnostics that allow for distinguishing between various
dark energy models and ΛCDM in section 3.5. Further, the behavior of energy density is
demonstrated in section 3.6. In section 3.7, we distinguish between the non-linear model under
consideration and a specific linear form of f(Q,T). Lastly, in section 3.8, we explain our findings
and draw our conclusions.
3.2 Overview of f(Q,T)Gravity
In order to obtain the generalized Friedmann equations, one considers a flat FLRW metric (1.17)
(fork= 0) and the equation (1.94), which leads to the following equations
8πρ=f
2−6FH2−2eG
1 +eG(˙FH+F˙H), (3.1)
8πp=−f
2+ 6FH2+ 2( ˙FH+F˙H), (3.2)
where dot represents a derivative with respect to time and F=fQand 8 πeG=fTare the
derivatives of fwith respect to QandT, respectively. The non-metricity scalar using the FLRW
metric is obtained as Q= 6H2. In light of the previous work done by [ 54], we use the assumption
G= 1 in the action (1.91) to maintain consistency.Chapter 3. f(Q,T)Gravity Models with Observational Constraints 54
We can then combine equations (3.1) & (3.2) and arrive at the following equation
˙H+˙F
FH=4π
F(1 +eG)(ρ+p). (3.3)
In the present discussion, our attention shall be directed in obtaining expressions for different
cosmological parameters. Thus, we begin our analysis by considering the energy density. For
generality, we assume that the cosmological matter satisfies an equation of state of the form
p= (γ−1)ρ, where γis a constant, and 0 ≤γ≤2. By solving equations (3.1) and(3.3), we
obtain the energy density ρ
ρ=f−12FH2
16π(1 +γeG). (3.4)
3.3 Cosmological Model with f(Q,T) =ξ Qn+bT
Given that the functional form is arbitrary, we focus on the power-law model of f(Q,T) [54]
represented by
f(Q, T) =ξ Qn+bT, (3.5)
where ξ,bandnare model parameters. We choose this form as it considers a Qnterm along with
the term Trepresenting deviations from ΛCDM and f(Q). Also note that F=fQ=ξ n Qn−1
and 8 πeG=fT=b. We determine the solution for zero pressure (dust matter), for which γ= 1
and the equation (3.4) reduces to
ρ=ξ6nH2n(1−2n)
16π+ 3b. (3.6)
The dynamical equation (3.3) that characterises the dynamics of the model is now presented
˙H+3(8π+b)
n(16π+ 3b)H2= 0, (3.7)
which integrates easily to yield the time evolution of the Hubble parameter H(t)
H(t) =1
At+c1, where A=3(8π+b)
n(16π+ 3b), (3.8)
andc1is the constant of integration. From equation (3.8), we obtain the explicit form of scale
factor as a simple power law type solution given by
a(t) =c2(At+c1)1
A, (3.9)
where c2is another constant of integration. As we are dealing with zero pressure and attempting
to explain the present cosmic acceleration of the Universe, we shall express all the aboveChapter 3. f(Q,T)Gravity Models with Observational Constraints 55
cosmological parameters in terms of redshift zdefined by z=a0
a−1, where a0is the present
value (at time t=t0) of the scale factor. In addition, we will consider the normalized value
a0=c2(At0+c1)1
A= 1 for which the t-zrelationship is established as
t(z) =−c1
A+1
A[c2(1 +z)]−A. (3.10)
Henceforth, using equation (3.10), we obtain the Hubble parameter in terms of z. That is
H(z) =H0(1 +z)A=H0(1 +z)3(8π+b)
n(16π+3b), (3.11)
containing only two model parameters nandb. Following the expression of the Hubble parameter,
our focus is to determine the deceleration parameter q=−1−˙H
H2, which turns out to be
q(t) =−1 +3(8π+b)
n(16π+ 3b), (3.12)
One can observe that the expression gives us a constant value for specific nandbas expected
due to the power-law type expansion of the model. The values of the model parameters nand
bin the H(z) function are currently unknown. To determine these values, we aim to impose
constraints by analyzing the observational data discussed in the subsequent section.
3.4 Parameters of the Model & Observational Constraints
The expressions in equations (3.11) and(3.12) illustrate the inclusion of two model parameters
that govern the dynamics of the model. The model parameter nis more significant than b,
as determined by the expression24π+ 3b
16π+ 3b, which contains the homogeneous term 3 bin both
numerator and denominator. The choice of model parameters nandbmust be such that the
deceleration parameter attains a negative value at present and is consistent with the observed
value q0≃ −0.54 [179,204,205]. This requires n=25.142+ b
7.542+0 .45b. In order for a model to be
consistent with the observations and the q0value of around −0.54, the model parameters nand
bmust satisfy the relation
n=25.142 + b
7.542 + 0 .45b. (3.13)
The graph in figure 3.1 illustrates the choice of these two model parameters. Based on the
information in figure 3.1, we can make a rough estimate for the range of the model parameters.
The best estimate could be n∈(1,3) and b∈(0,2). We have examined two observational
datasets to achieve more precise estimates for the model parameters nandb. The first dataset
consists of 57 points of Hubble data, while the second dataset comprises 580 points of Union 2.1
compilation supernovae dataset, as discussed in section 2.5.Chapter 3. f(Q,T)Gravity Models with Observational Constraints 56
Since, the values of the model parameter branges from −∞to +∞, the b-axis in the above
contour plots is unbounded but the model parameter nis in its fixed range n∈(1,4) in both
the contour plots. We have obtained the best fitting pair ( n, b) of model parameter values in
figure 3.3.

3.5 Statefinder and Om(z)Diagnostic Analysis
This section discusses the diagnostic tools used to distinguish between various dark energy
models, as discussed in section 2.4.1. The plot of r−sandr−qplanes is depicted in figure
3.4. Different dark energy models can be represented by different trajectories in the r−splane.
Figure 3.4 reveals that the point ( s, r) = (0 ,1) represents the ΛCDM, whereas ( q, r) = (−1,1)
corresponds to the de Sitter (dS) point. That is, our constructed model will finally approach
the ΛCDM passing from the quintessence phase. The red line divides the plane into two parts,
depicting the Quintessence phase as a lower half. The statefinder plots have been done for the
values of nandbconstrained by the H(z) and SNeIa datasets. The phenomenon described in
this study is also evident in previous research conducted by [ 183,206]. We note that for the
H(z) dataset, the randsparameters at the present epoch are r0=−0.112 and s0= 0.554, while
for the SNeIa dataset, we have r0=−0.118 and s0= 0.538. However, according to reference
[207], these parameters have the potential to be inferred by forthcoming discoveries, thereby
significantly helping in the explanation of the nature of dark energy. Additionally, we haveChapter 3. f(Q,T)Gravity Models with Observational Constraints 58

a term (1 −2n) that will be negative for the discussed range of nvalues, we must adopt the
adjustable free parameter ξso that ρassumes a positive value. In figure 3.6 (left panel), we
depict the evolution of the energy density with respect to redshift zfor the constrained numerical
values of the model parameters nandb. Also, we have shown the evolution of the density

Now, let us analyse the simplest instance of the functional form, specifically the linear functional
form of f(Q,T) in the next section.
3.7 Linear Form of f(Q,T) =ξ Q+bT
We can see that for n= 1, the considered functional form of f(Q,T) =ξ Qn+bTreduces to
the linear form f(Q,T) =ξ Q+bT, which is similar to the linear functional form considered in
[54]. One can obtain the expression for the energy density from equation (3.6)
ρ=−6ξH2
16π+ 3b, (3.16)Chapter 3. f(Q,T)Gravity Models with Observational Constraints 60
and the dynamical equation in Hreads as
˙H+3(8π+b)
16π+ 3bH2= 0, (3.17)
yielding a Hubble parameter in the form
H=1
Bt+k1. (3.18)
Here, B=24π+3b
16π+3bandk1is the constant of integration. Using the equation (3.18) , we can also
easily find the scale factor given by
a(t) =k2(Bt+k1)1
B, (3.19)
where k2is the constant of integration. As discussed above, we must express all the above
cosmological parameters in terms of redshift z, for which the t−zrelationship is obtained as
t(z) =−k1
B+1
B[k2(1 +z)]−B. (3.20)
Henceforth, the Hubble parameter in terms of zcan be written as follows
H(z) =H0(1 +z)B=H0(1 +z)(24π+3b
16π+3b), (3.21)
which contains only one model parameter b. Moreover, q(t) =−1 +24π+3b
16π+3bis also constant
with only one model parameter b. Since, the term24π+3b

3.8 Conclusions
This chapter addressed the late time cosmology using a well-motivated f(Q,T) gravity model
using the functional form f(Q,T) =ξ Qn+bT, where ξ,nandbare model parameters proposed
in [54]. By constraining the free parameters with observational datasets: 57 points of the
Hubble dataset and 580 points of the Union 2.1 compilation supernovae dataset, we found
that the deceleration parameter at z= 0 to be negative, that is q0=−0.17 and q0=−0.19,
respectively, which is consistent with the present scenario of an accelerating Universe. Previous
works in power law cosmology also reported similar constraints (see for example [ 183,206]).
The solution and data analysis have already been discussed for the model considered in [ 54]
with the f(Q,T) function f(Q,T) =−σQ−δT2(σandδare model parameters). Another
model is also considered in the same paper with the f(Q,T) function f(Q,T) =α Q+βT(αChapter 3. f(Q,T)Gravity Models with Observational Constraints 61
andβare model parameters) which is similar to the linear case with n= 1 in our considered
f(Q,T) =ξ Qn+bTform, that is, ξ Q+bT. In the linear case, the solution mimicked the power
law expansion model with a(t)∝(Bt+c1)1
B, where B=24π+3b
16π+3b. This model relies on a single
parameter b. It is observed that the parameter bcontribute significantly less in the evolution as
the term B=24π+3b
16π+3b≈3
2forb∈(−∞,∞). Consequently, the model behaved similarly to the
standard lore of a(t)∼t2
3with a constant deceleration q= 0.5.
We have thoroughly investigated the nature of dark energy modelled by the parametrization
f(Q,T) =ξ Qn+bTusing the statefinder diagnostic as r−sandr−qplanes and the Om(z)
diagnostic analysis for our model. For the values of the model parameters nandbobtained by
57 points of H(z) dataset, the present statefinder parameter values are obtained as r0=−0.112
ands0= 0.554, whereas the Union 2.1 compilation dataset resulted r0=−0.118 and s0= 0.538.
The model investigated here is good at explaining the current observations but may not adequately
explain the early evolution (as it is inconsistent with the constraints derived from the BAO
dataset, which are not considered here). One important thing to notice is that the model
parameter b, which is the coefficient of the trace Tin the f(Q,T) =ξ Qn+bTform considered,
contributes very little to the evolution, indicating that the linear trace Tdoes not affect the
evolution. The behavior of energy density and the density parameter with respect to redshift
zfor the constrained values of the model parameters nandbare depicted in figure 3.6 with
Ωm0= 0.3089. Some more functional form of f(Q,T) could be explored in the same way and is
deferred to our future works.
One can also consider an effective equation of state which could distinguish and discriminate
between the standard model and various theories of gravity. Henceforth, in the upcoming chapter,
we will investigate f(Q,T) gravity using an effective equation of state.Chapter 4
Constraining Effective Equation of
State in f(Q,T)Gravity
The present chapter discusses a parameterized effective equation of state with two parameters in
f(Q,T) gravity. The detailed study of the work follows as
•We use the recently proposed f(Q,T) gravity to investigate the accelerated expansion of
the Universe, where Qis the non-metricity and Tis the trace of the energy-momentum
tensor.
•The investigation uses a parameterized effective equation of state with two parameters m
andn.
•We consider the linear form f(Q,T) =Q+bT, where bis a constant. By confining
the model with the recently published 1048 Pantheon sample, we could determine the
parameters b,m, and nwith the best fit.
4.1 Introduction
Several studies have investigated cosmological models and the phenomenon of rapid cosmological
expansion within the framework of f(Q,T) gravity, employing various functional forms. Yang et
al. [208] developed the geodesic deviation and Raychaudhuri equations in the f(Q,T) gravity
based on the observation that the curvature-matter coupling considerably modifies the nature of
tidal forces and the equation of motion in the Newtonian limit. Hence, it is possible to investigate
*The work in this chapter is covered by the following publication:
Constraining Effective Equation of State in f(Q,T)Gravity , European Physical Journal C, 81, 555 (2021).
62Chapter 4. Constraining Effective Equation of State in f(Q,T)Gravity 63
the feasibility of the recently proposed f(Q,T) gravity within various cosmological scenarios.
Thus, utilizing the post-Newtonian limit seems suitable for comparing theoretical predictions with
observations made within the solar system. Therefore, a rationale exists for examining multiple
aspects of the f(Q,T) theory from a theoretical, observational and cosmological perspective. To
review f(Q,T) gravity in different aspects, one can check references [202, 209].
It is commonly known that the EoS parameter defines the relationship between pressure and
energy density. The EoS parameter is used to classify various phases of the Universe, specifically
distinguishing between decelerated and accelerated expansion. Understanding the late time
acceleration in f(Q,T) gravity is the focus of our work, and we do so by reconstructing a
parameterized equation of state parameter. The present value of the effective equation of state
parameter is established by model parameters that are constrained by observational evidence.
CMB [ 210], SNeIa [ 14,15], BAO [ 211] and other observational datasets are currently available
for various measurements and are providing robust evidence for the accelerating Universe.
Consequently, we will use Pantheon datasets [ 151] to constrain the model parameters. The
recently proposed supernovae Pantheon sample contains 1048 points covering the redshift range
0.01< z < 2.26. We use the MCMC ensemble sampler given by the emcee library.
The chapter has been divided into various sections. In section 4.2, we engage in a comprehensive
examination of the cosmological model employing the parameterized equation of state. We
derive an expression for the Hubble parameter using the Friedmann equations of f(Q,T). The
brief discussion on observational data used to constrain the model parameters is presented in
section 4.3. Section 4.4 includes the behavior of cosmological parameters such as the deceleration
parameter and EoS parameter. The last section 4.5 encompasses the concluding remarks.
4.2 Cosmological Model and Equation of State
In a flat FLRW metric, we have already obtained the generalized Friedmann equations in (3.1)
and(3.2). Since, f(Q,T) is an arbitrary function of QandT, we consider the simplest functional
form f(Q,T) =Q+bT, where bis a constant. In order to elaborate upon our prior research on
the linear trace term, we assumed a specific functional form. One can note that F=fQ= 1
and 8 πeG=b. Further solving equations (3.1) and(3.2) forpandρallow us to determine the
equation of state parameter ω=p
ρgiven by
ω=3H2(8π+b) +˙H(16π+ 3b)
b˙H−3H2(8π+b). (4.1)
To establish a comprehensive understanding, it is imperative to express all the cosmological
parameters in terms of redshift z. Consequently, the relation for tandzusinga0

Normalizing the present value of scale factor to be a0=a(0) = 1. The Hubble parameter can be
written in the form

dz. (4.3)
We need one more alternate equation to solve equation (4.1) forH. So, we assume a well-
motivated parametric form of the equation of state parameter as a function of redshift z[213]
which is defined by

zero at a high redshift zand depends on the model parameter at z= 0. The effective equation
of state assumed for the current reconstruction conveniently accommodates these two phases of
evolution. A positive model parameter frequently establishes a lower limit on the value of ωand
maintains it in the non-phantom regime. Using equations (4.1),(4.3) and(4.4), we obtain the
Hubble parameter Hin terms of redshift zas

where l=3(8π+b)

In the following section, we attempt to obtain the best possible values for the model parameters
associated with the equation of the Hubble parameter.
4.3 Observational Constraints
This section describes the observational dataset used to constrain the model parameters b,m,
andnafter obtaining the solutions for our model. We use the MCMC sampling technique to
explore the parameter space and mainly employ Python’s emcee [ 214] library. To estimate the
parameters, one need not compute the evidence, which is a normalizing constant. Instead, the
prior and likelihood are sufficient to determine the posterior distributions of the parameters.
We use the recent Pantheon dataset for our work. One can find the dataset in the link8; it
consists of 1048 Supernova Type Ia experiment results discovered by the Pan-STARRS1(PS1)
Medium Deep Survey, the Low-z, SDSS, SNLS, and HST surveys [ 151,212], in the redshift range
z∈(0.01,2.26) described in section 5.3.2.

Initially, we perform the analysis considering a flat prior for all the parameters. However, we
notice the marginalized distribution for parameter bto be roughly uniform in the range. We then
motivate our work to study the result in the neighbourhood of b= 0. This approach intends to
find any deviation from GR, which accounts for a local minimum for the function in equation
(4.5). We also perform the numerical analysis with a Gaussian prior for the parameter bwith
σ= 1.0 as dispersion. The results are presented in figure 4.2. There is no significant difference
in the marginalized distributions of the remaining parameters, mandn.
If we consider the case of b= 0, the model reduces to f(Q,T) =fΛ(Q) =Q, i.e. it has a direct
link to ΛCDM model. Therefore, the equation of Hubble parameter Hreduces to

In this section, we examine the behavior of the deceleration and equation of state parameters.

deceleration to acceleration phase at redshift zt. The value of the transition redshift has been
determined to have a value of zt= 0.58±0.30 [215]. The findings align with several works in
literature [ 182,216]. Also, we can note that the value of q0is obtained as −0.52 [217], which is
negative at present, indicating that the Universe is undergoing acceleration.Chapter 4. Constraining Effective Equation of State in f(Q,T)Gravity 68

In addition, we have analyzed the effective EoS parameter, as shown in figure 4.5. The value of
the EoS parameter at z= 0 is obtained as ω0=−0.68+0.10
−0.11[217], which indicates an accelerating
phase, exhibiting a quintessence type behavior.
4.5 Conclusions
As new theories of gravity emerge in the literature, it is vital to put them to the test to determine
if they are viable in describing the dark sector of the Universe. To begin, we considered the
functional form f(Q,T) =Q+bT, where bis a free parameter.
We used a well-motivated parametric form of the equation of state parameter as a function of
redshift zto solve the field equations for H. At the epoch of recent acceleration, the value of the
EoS parameter is seen to be negative, specifically less than −1
3. At a high redshift z, the value of
ωtends to zero for positive values of the model parameters mandn, and its value is influenced
by the model parameter at z= 0. The Pantheon study, a recently proposed observational
dataset, was used to constrain the parameter space. The parameters from our study have bounds
ofb= 0.2+2.7
−2.9,m= 0.47+0.27
−0.21, and n= 3.2+1.8
−2.0. The error bar plot depicting the 1048 points
from the Pantheon dataset, together with our derived model and the ΛCDM model assuming
Ωm0= 0.3, Ω Λ0= 0.7 and H0= 69 km/s/Mpc demonstrates a good match to the observational
results as seen in section 4.3.
Finally, we observed the behavior of the deceleration parameter and equation of state parameter
in section 4.4. We see a well-behaved transition from deceleration to acceleration phase at
redshift zt. The value of the transition redshift is obtained as zt= 0.58±0.30, while the present
deceleration parameter is estimated to be q0=−0.52. Furthermore, it is worth noticing that
the value of the EoS parameter at z= 0 exhibits a value of ω0=−0.68+0.10
−0.11, which provides
strong evidence in favour of accelerating phase. The current analysis provides a justificationChapter 4. Constraining Effective Equation of State in f(Q,T)Gravity 69
and motivation for investigating these extensions, potentially explaining the deviation from the
ΛCDM. In this case, the model does not deviate much from the ΛCDM.
In addition to considering the cosmic evidence, it is imperative to ascertain the stability of the
newly proposed f(Q,T) theory. This is necessary to facilitate the analysis of the perturbation
level differences between this theory and the ΛCDM framework. The investigation of f(Q,T)
can be further explored in future research endeavors. The study mentioned previously examines
modified gravity models as a potential alternative to dark energy models. Our subsequent
work aims to explore an alternative perspective on the enigma of dark matter, as given by
modified theories. In this study, we investigate the impact of modified gravity on the dynamics
of large-scale structures.Chapter 5

5.1 Introduction
It is well-known that GR is a quite successful theory on various cosmological scales, and it
can describe the recent accelerated expansion of the Universe by introducing the so-called
*The work in this chapter is covered by the following publication:

cosmological constant (or Λ term) in the Einstein-Hilbert action integral. Since the gravitational
Lagrangian is not practically restricted by only the linear Ricci scalar term, one can introduce
additional terms to emulate effective dark energy and reproduce different Universe evolutionary
phases, such as cosmological inflation or late time accelerated expansion.
There are many ways to modify GR, for example, by introducing some matter fields (canonical
scalar field, vector and gauge boson fields, Dirac spinors, etc.). Another way is to present an
entirely different notion of the Lorentzian 4-manifold curvature by adjusting the metric-affine
connection [ 25,218]. For example, one could use the so-called torsion or non-metricity, which
are constructed based on Weitzenb¨ ock and metric incompatible affine connections, respectively.
Consequently, GR has two analogs, namely, TEGR and STEGR as mentioned in section 1.6. In
the current work, we will focus on the arbitrary parameterization of an extended STEGR ( f(Q)
gravitation).
A key aspect of f(Q) theory is the usage of a flat connection pertaining to the existence of
affine coordinates in which all of its components vanish, converting covariant derivatives into
partial derivatives [ 219,220]. So, it is possible to distinguish gravity from inertial effects in
thef(Q) theory. For many modified gravity theories, the development of the f(Q) theory
provides a fresh starting point. It offers a straightforward formulation in which self-accelerating
solutions spontaneously appear in both the early and late Universe. Compared to other geometric
extensions of GR, both f(T) and f(Q) theories have a substantial benefit in that the background
field equations are always of second order.
Many studies have been incorporated on f(Q) gravity and is a very promising theory, that
can reproduce the behaviour of both early and late Universe, satisfy constraints from Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB), SNeIa, BAO, H(z) datasets and primordial scalar index ns,
standard sirens from LIGO/VIRGO/ET [ 221,222]. For instance, exponential gravitation was
constrained in the study by [ 223,224], and the authors found out that such a theory can
challenge concordance ΛCDM theory. Additionally, observational constraints on the f(Q) gravity
have been established for a number of parameterizations of the f(Q) function using various
observational probes [ 42,109]. Aside from these findings, f(Q) gravity has been the focus of
several investigations in various studies [ 51,225–227]. In the current chapter, we are going
to investigate exponential f(Q) gravity in terms of observational constraints using MCMC
methodologies and high-resolution N-body simulations, which will be discussed in the following
subsections.
5.1.1 N-body Simulation as a Probe of Modified Gravity
To probe the validity of a particular modified theory of gravitation, one needs to incorporate
various cosmological observables, ranging from cosmic expansion rate to clustering and structureChapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 72
formation history. The latter could be most effectively studied with the use of the so-called
N-body simulations, which are well-known to be the best theoretical probe of the large scale
structure of the Universe, that provide information on the matter power spectrum/bispectrum,
N-point correlation functions and halo mass function, void size function, etc. Over the last few
years, such an approach has attracted some interest in modified gravity (see the work in [ 228]).
Authors of the paper [ 229] developed a pipeline to differentiate modified gravity theories from the
ΛCDM model and constrain those theories properly using voids in the N-body simulations, that
are known to be less affected by the non-linear and baryonic physics in relation to the dark matter
halos. Besides, in addition to voids, intrinsic shape alignments of massive halos and galaxy/halo
angular clustering could be used to discriminate modified gravity theories from ΛCDM in the
presence of massive neutrino (see [230] and [231] respectively). The aforementioned Halo Mass
Function (further-HMF) was examined for f(Q) and Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) gravities
in [232]. Widely used code MG-Gadget , introduced and developed in [ 233] were employed to
study f(R) Hu-Sawicki theory [ 234,235], and conformally coupled gravity [ 236]. In turn, we are
going to use ME-GADGET code (for documentation, check [ 237]) to study f(Q) gravity behaviour.
Such code was applied to the case of f(T) theory [ 238], interacting dark energy [ 237] and cubic
vector gallileon [239].
This chapter is organized as follows: In section 5.1, we briefly introduce modified theories
of gravity and N-body simulations. Consequently, in section 5.2, we present the foundations
of symmetric teleparallel gravity and we adopt the FLRW isotropic line element to derive
field equations for our exponential choice of f(Q) function. In section 5.3, we introduce each
observational dataset of our consideration and perform MCMC analysis. In section 5.4, we
analyze the provided constraints deriving theoretical predictions for the deceleration parameter,
statefinder pair and Om(z). In the following section 5.5, we set up the ME-GADGET suite and
study the N-body output for a small simulation box size. We therefore compare the results with
the ones above obtained for large Lboxin section 5.6. Finally, in the last section 5.7, we present
the concluding remarks on the key topics of our study.
5.2 Modified Symmetric Teleparallel Gravitation
As we already mentioned in section 1.6.4, both Ricci scalar and torsion terms vanish, and
therefore we are left with only non-metricity. Therefore, to proceed with the STEGR case, one
could derive the non-metricity scalar from the non-metricity tensor and its independent traces
in section 1.6.4 defined by
Q=−gµν(Lα
βνLβ
µα−Lβ
αβLα
µν) =−PαβγQαβγ. (5.1)Chapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 73
The condition of symmetric teleparallelism makes the generic affine connection to be inertial.
The most general connection is
˜Γα
µν=∂xα
∂ξσ∂2ξσ
∂xµ∂xν, (5.2)
where ξσis an arbitrary function of spacetime position. We can always choose a coordinate
xα=ξσby utilizing a general coordinate transformation, where the general affine connection
˜Γα
µν= 0. We call this coordinate the coincident gauge [ 42]. Thus, in the coincident gauge, we
will have Qαµν=∂αgµν, i.e. all the covariant derivatives are identical to ordinary derivatives.
Now we are going to present the formalism of modified symmetric teleparallel cosmology. Einstein-
Hilbert action of the f(Q) theory of gravity is therefore could be written as mentioned in equation
(1.91).
The reason for the above action and specific selection of the non-metricity scalar is that GR
is recreated, up to a boundary term for the choice f=Q, i.e., for this choice, we recover the
allegedly “symmetric teleparallel equivalent of GR”. By varying the action (1.91) with respect
to the metric tensor (using least action principle δS= 0), we could obtain the corresponding
field equations in equation (1.92) . The connection equation of motion can be computed by
noticing that the variation of the connection with respect to ξαis equivalent to performing a
diffeomorphism so that ∂ξΓα
µν=−LξΓα
µν=−∇µ∇νξα[53]. Besides this, in the absence of
hypermomentum, one can take the variation of equation (1.91) with respect to the connection
∇µ∇ν √−gfQPµν
α
= 0. (5.3)
For the metric and connection equations, one can notice that ∇µTµ
ν= 0, where ∇µis the
metric-covariant derivative.
Since, we have already defined all of the necessary quantities, we could proceed further and set
up the background spacetime.
5.2.1 FLRW Cosmology
In order to study the evolution of our Universe, it will be useful to assume that background
spacetime is isotropic and homogeneous, namely FLRW spacetime9. Consequently, with the
assumption of FLRW spacetime, the non-metricity scalar is written as follows
Q= 6H2. (5.4)
9Notice that we have used the Diff gauge freedom to fix the coincident gauge and, therefore, setting the lapse
(N(t) in metric) to 1 is not, in principle, a permitted choice. It happens however that the f(Q) theories retain a
time-reparametrization invariance that allows to get rid of the lapse [42].Chapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 74
Finally, one could evaluate the FLRW field equations of the f(Q) theory:
3H2=κ(ρm+ρeff), (5.5)
3H2+ 2˙H=−κ(pm+peff). (5.6)
Here, ρmandpmare matter energy density and isotropic pressure, respectively. Moreover, in the
equation above ρeffandpeffare effective energy density and pressure that define the contribution
off(Q) gravity to the field equations. For modified STEGR, field equations with exact forms of
effective quantities read
3H2=κ
2fQ
ρm+f
2
, (5.7)
 
12H2fQQ+fQ˙H=−κ
2(ρm+pm). (5.8)
where fQ=∂f(Q)
∂Q, f QQ=∂2f(Q)
∂Q2.
The energy-momentum tensor of the cosmological fluid which is given in equation (1.27) leads to
conservation equation as ˙ρ+ 3H(ρ+p)= 0. In symmetric teleparallel gravity and its extensions,
the conservation law Tµ
ν;µ= 0 holds for the matter energy-momentum tensor. The Tµ
ν;µ= 0
holds through (5.3) for the connection as well [127, 220].
5.2.2 Exponential f(Q)Gravity
This work particularly aims at investigating the f(Q) gravity model, namely modified exponential
f(Q) gravity (which is built from the linear and exponential terms, respectively). In f(Q) theory,
numerous cosmic possibilities have been examined using various exponential models, notably
inflationary cosmology, BBN constraints, and dynamic system analysis [ 44,52,240]. For that
kind of gravity, f(Q) function reads (we adapt the work of [241] for modified STEGR)
f(Q) =Q+αQ0(1−e−β√
Q/Q 0), (5.9)
where α,βare free parameters corresponding to additional degrees of freedom and Q0= 6H2
0
is the present value of Q. We can reduce the number of degrees of freedom by matching first
Friedmann equation (5.7) at the present time (i.e. assuming z= 0)
α=−eβ(−1 + Ω m0)
−1 +eβ−β. (5.10)
Thus, the complexity of this form is just one step more than the standard ΛCDM. The exponential
modified gravity could satisfy stability, validity and not cross the phantom divide line [ 242]. InChapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 75
order to solve the field equations and obtain the numerical form of the Hubble parameter, we use
˙H=aHdH
da. (5.11)
We will solve the field equation numerically, as already stated, with Mathematica numerical
ODE solver NDSolve . Initial conditions at the vanishing redshift for ˙Hcould be therefore set up
(as a cosmographical quantity)
˙H0=−H2
0(1 +q0), (5.12)
where q0is the current deceleration parameter, we fix it to q0=−0.55 [243]. Additionally,
for MCMC, as truths, we assume that the present value of the Hubble parameter is H0=
69km/s/Mpc and that matter mass fraction at present is Ω m0= 0.315±0.007, following the
observational constraints of Planck2018 [65].
5.3 MCMC Constraints
In this section, we constrain our f(Q) gravity model via observational datasets. To explore the
parameter space, we will be using the MCMC methodology and Python package emcee [214].
5.3.1 Observational Hubble Data (OHD)
To determine the priors and likelihood functions (which are necessary), we use the H(z) dataset
consisting of 31 points from cosmic chronometers described in section 2.5.1. We introduce the
chi-square function as mentioned in equation (2.27) to constrain our modified gravity model.
The likelihood function for MCMC sampling has its usual exponential form L= exp( −χ2/2).
5.3.2 Pantheon SNeIa Sample
We also use the Pantheon dataset to constrain our modified gravity with dark energy, which
consists of 1048 SNeIa (discovered by the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) Medium Deep Survey, Low z,
SNLS, SDSS and HST [ 151]). In this case, we have used the binned Pantheon sample10. The
corresponding chi-square function reads as in equation (2.28) . The nuisance parameters in the
Tripp formula [ 244]µ=mB−MB+αx1−βc+ ∆ M+ ∆ Bwere retrieved using the novel method
known as BEAMS with Bias Correction (BBC) [ 245], and the observed distance modulus is
now equal to the difference between the corrected apparent magnitude MBand the absolute
magnitude mB(µ=mB−MB). Additionally, one can define the chi-square function in terms
10https ://github.com/dscolnic/Pantheon/tree/master/Binned dataChapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 76
of the covariance matrix as follows [246]:
χ2
SN= ∆µTC−1∆µ, (5.13)
where the covariance matrix consists of statistical and systematic uncertainties respectively [ 247]:
C=Dstat+Csys. (5.14)
In the current work, we assume that the diagonal matrix of statistical uncertainties looks like
Dstat,ii=σ2
µ(zi). Besides, systematic uncertainties are derived using the Bias Corrections (BBC)
method, introduced and developed in [151]:

Indexes {i, j}denote the redshift bins for distance modulus, Skhere denotes the magnitude of

5.3.3 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
Consequently, we also use the chi-square function for the BAO dataset as described in section
2.5.2. In addition, we consider that the photon decoupling epoch arises at the redshift [16]
z∗= 1048[1 + 0 .00124(Ω bh2)−0.738][1 + g1(Ωmh2)g2], (5.16)
where,

g2=0.560
1 + 21 .1(Ωbh2)−1.81. (5.18)
This dataset was gathered from the works of [200, 210, 248].
We performed the joint analysis for the combined H(z)+SNeIa+BAO by minimizing χ2
H+χ2

BAO. The results are, therefore, numerically derived from MCMC trained on H(z), Pantheon,
BAO, and joint datasets. Results are placed in the Table 5.1 for model parameters H0,βand
Ωm0. Furthermore, the 1 σand 2 σlikelihood contours for the possible subsets of parameter space
are presented in figure 5.1.Chapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 77
5.3.4 Statistical Evaluation
To evaluate the success of our MCMC analysis, one should perform the statistical evaluation
using the so-called Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC). The first quantity, namely AIC can be expressed as follows [249]:
AIC = χ2
min+ 2d. (5.19)
with dbeing the number of free parameters in a chosen model. To compare our results with
the well-known ΛCDM model, we are going to use the AIC difference between our modified
gravity model and the ΛCDM ∆ AIC=|AIC ΛCDM −AIC MG|. In that case, if ∆ AIC<2, there
is strong evidence in favor of the modified gravity model, while for 4 <∆AIC≤7 there is little
evidence in favor of the modified gravity model of our consideration. Finally, for the case with
∆AIC>10, there is practically no evidence in favor of the modified gravity [ 250]. In addition,
BIC is defined through the relation, written down below:
BIC = χ2
min+dlnN. (5.20)
Here, Nis the number of data points used for MCMC. For BIC, if ∆ BIC<2, there is no strong
evidence against a chosen model that deviates from ΛCDM, if 2 ≤∆BIC<6 there is evidence
against the modified gravity model and finally for ∆ BIC>6, there is strong evidence against
the modified gravity model. We therefore store the χ2
min/AIC/BIC data for the modified gravity
model of our consideration in the Table 5.1. We see that ∆AIC = 1 .25 and ∆BIC = 3 .01 so our
model can precisely mimic ΛCDM one.

5.4 Validity of Cosmological Constraints
Consequently, we plot both statefinder parameter phase portraits, deceleration parameter, and
additionally H(z) as probes of model validity in the cosmological sense in figures 5.2 and 5.3.
Statefinder diagnostics and q(z) are performed only for the joint dataset, since other datasets
show similar behavior. Remarkably, a transition from the deceleration to an acceleration phase
is seen in figure 5.4. A valid interval for q0is marked as a gray area. As stated already, one
may check the Universe evolutionary scenario using statefinder pairs {r, s}and{r, q}. From the
r−splane of our model, one could observe that the early Universe was filled with quintessence,Chapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 79
then passed the ΛCDM phase, and is currently reverting towards the quintessence scenario.
On the other hand, in the r−qplane, it is evident that the Universe once passed through the
ΛCDM phase. However, now that our spacetime is generally filled with quintessential fluid, it is
expected that the future universe will eventually turn to the de-Sitter state (when the Λ term
will fully dominate). The point on quintessential fluid also coincides with MCMC observational
constraints.

Consequently, we place the numerical solution of Om(z) function for f(Q) model in figure 5.5.
For the sake of comparison, we as well plot Om(z) solutions within the classical ΛCDM model
and within ωvarying ΛCDM cosmologies. As one could easily notice, for our f(Q) model, Om(z)
shows only Om(z)<Ωm0behavior in the distant past, which could lead to the presence of
phantom fluid (for more information on the subject, see [251]).

However, at z≈2, our model transits ΛCDM and has a constantly growing trend. Therefore,
in the near past, the quintessential fluid appears, which converges well with the statefinder
diagnostics and MCMC. Finally, we also analyse both matter and effective dark energy mass
densities for our model to confirm its validity. Corresponding results are plotted in figure 5.5.Chapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 81
One can easily notice both Ω m0∧ΩΛ0∈[0,1] and their sum always converges to unity, an epoch
of the equality appears at redshift z≈0.35, which is very close to the ΛCDM estimate.
The numerical fitting findings are utilized as input parameters for simulation purposes, enabling
an investigation into the effect of the interaction between the dark sector and the structure
formation process. This investigation is conducted through the implementation of N-body
simulations. The parameters utilized in our computational analysis are presented in Table 5.1.
5.5 N-body Simulations of LSS with Small LBox
As we already remarked, the primary purpose of this chapter is to perform N-body simulations
of the comoving box that contains DM+baryonic matter and dark energy in exponential f(Q)
gravitation and compare our results with the Large Scale Structure of concordance ΛCDM
cosmology. For that aim, we will use the publicly available code ME-GADGET , a modification of
the well-known hydrodynamical N-body code GADGET2 . It has been modified for generality to
perform simulations for practically any cosmological model. The code above is described in the
pioneering works of [ 252,253], whereas the tests are provided in [ 254]. This code as an input
needs tables with Hubble flow H/H 0and the deviation of effective gravitational constant from
the Newtonian one Geff/GN(in some models of modified gravity, namely screened ones, such
deviation exists only up to some scale kscreen because of the so-called fifth force). One can find
the effective gravitational constant exact form in [53] as
Geff=GN
fQ. (5.21)
The equation above is being numerically solved, assuming appropriate best-fit values for the
free parameters of our model. As one could easily notice, at the very early time (high- zepochs),
f(Q) gravity has Newtonian-like gravitational constant and then, at approximately a≈0.1,Geff
is being separated from GNfor our model. Since we have already defined needed inputs for
ME-GADGET code, we could proceed further to fine-tuning our simulation setup.
5.5.1 Simulation Setup
One needs to define various parameters to produce the simulations and initial conditions based on
the second-order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (namely, 2LPT). We want to obtain the mid-
resolution simulations, and henceforth, particle number is N= 5123and mesh size is respectively
Nmesh= 2×5123. The simulation box has periodic vacuum boundary conditions and sides
with length 10 Mpc/h. Initial conditions were produced with the Simp2LPTic code (see GitHub
repository https://github.com/liambx/Simp2LPTic), and glass files (pre-initial conditions) wereChapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 82
generated with the use of ccvt-preic (check https://github.com/liaoshong/ccvt-preic). The
capacity constrained Voronoi tessellation (CCTV) method, which is an alternative method to
produce a uniform and isotropic particle distribution to generate pre-initial conditions. More
details are explained in the appendix.

values on different redshifts.
We assumed that the glass tile fraction is unitary, since the final configuration can be scaled to
any box size. Moreover, cosmological parameters were borrowed from our MCMC constraints,
discussed earlier: h=H0/100 = 0 .689±0.016 (so-called “little-h”), Ω m0= 0.292±0.016, leading
to Ω Λ0= 0.708, if one will not take into account radiation and massive neutrino species. On
the other hand, baryon mass density equals Ω b= 0.0493 (the relation between total matterChapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 83
density and baryon mass density decides how many gas particles are present in the simulation).
Moreover, matter power spectrum amplitude at k= 8Mpc/his assumed to be σ8= 0.811±0.006.
The initial power spectrum is linear, constructed from the Eisenstein & Hu transfer function
[255] (power spectrum were constructed using code CAMB, see [ 257]). Initial conditions have been
generated at the redshift z= 10, and we use the spectrum index of scalar perturbations as
ns= 0.9649±0.0042 obtained from Planck [256].

5.5.2 Results
The current subsection will discuss the main results, obtained from the N-body simulations of
the Large Scale Structure of the Universe. Firstly, we demonstrate the spatial slices of CDM
overdensity δCDM =ρCDM/ρCDM for our f(Q) gravity model with different values of redshift z
in the figure 5.6. In addition to the overdensity measurements, we also show the temperature of
gasTthat arises from Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and mean molecular weight
µ=mHI/m, which defines the relation between mean particle mass and neutral hydrogen particle
mass on the figure 5.7, respectively. As one can easily notice, the DM walls are represented by
the smaller value of mean molecular weight. Besides, temperature maps show the well-known hot
“bubbles” within the Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM) that are formed due to impinging galactic
winds.
Now we investigate the matter power spectrum for our model. For comparison, we are going to
use the ΛCDM cosmology power spectrum, generated with the use of CAMB code11[257–260].
In order to extract P(k) for some value of redshift within our N-body framework, we used
Python-based code Pylians312[261].
We consequently compare the matter power spectrum on the figure 5.8 with/without Redshift-
Space Distortions (RSDs) directed along both X,YandZaxes. As we noticed during numerical
analysis, up to some knear kBoxlimit for our simulation, P(k) spectrum in Fourier space does
reconstruct non-linear matter power spectrum, given by CAMB, while Redshift-Space Distorted
(RSD) one behaves like the linear matter power spectrum, as expected. Also, it is worth noticing
that the difference between RSD and regular matter power spectrum is bigger for the CDM+Gas
case. Finally, the effect of RSDs in our simulations is almost isotropic, so that ∆( RSD) differs
only by a few percent with the change of RSD direction axis.
5.5.3 Halo Mass Function
Now, we employ the halo mass function (HMF) to demonstrate the relative frequency of dark
matter halos across a range of mass values that is, it defines the number of halos at a certain
mass. It is a good measure of the structure formation. There is an accepted notion that galaxies
are situated within dark matter halos, and it is valuable to analyze halo statistics for establishing
connections between simulations and observations. First, we built the halo catalog for all of our
snapshots with the use of halo/subhalo structure finder, namely ROCKSTAR (for more information
on the subject, refer to the documentation paper [ 262]). Consequently, we built the binned
halo mass function, which is based on the values of M200c(the mass of enclosed halo volume
with an energy density 200 times bigger than the critical density of the Universe ρcr). We plot

mass function, based on Planck2018 fiducial cosmology and CAMB power spectrum at the z= 0.
Seth-Tormen HMF was computed using the python package pynbody [263].
From the figure 5.9 shown, one could easily notice that, in general, our prediction for halo mass
function from the modified gravity N-body simulation shows values of nthat approximately
coincide with the ones that are theoretically predicted by the Seth-Tormen HMF.

5.6 LSS with Large LBox: Comparison
We are now going to perform an analysis of N-body simulation for a bigger simulation box size,
namely with Lbox= 100 h−1Mpc. In that case, we only differ in force resolution ( ϵ= 3.9 kpc),
while other cosmological parameters are assumed to be the same. At first, we, as usual, plot the
CDM overdensity field for vanishing redshift in figure 5.10.
In addition, we also plot the matter power spectrum for CDM, CDM+baryons in figure 5.11.
As an obvious consequence of a larger box size, one can notice that maximum wavenumber k
grew to kmax≈20h/Mpc. Even at such big scales, our matter power spectrum, derived from
the corresponding N-body simulation, converges with the theoretical prediction from CAMB code
with up to sub-percent accuracy. As we noticed previously for the small simulation box, the
axis of redshift-space distortions had a very small impact on the matter power spectrum. This
statement also holds for large Lbox.
In the previous section, we discussed the halo mass function for the case with a smaller simulation
box. Now we can discuss the same matter for the larger LBox. As it appears, HMF extracted
from the simulation replicates the Seth-Tormen HMF almost perfectly up to M≈1014M⊙Chapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 87
(see figure 5.9). However, at bigger halo masses, our simulation HMF slightly differs from the
theoretical prediction, usually observed in N-body simulations.

5.6.1 Reduced Bispectrum from 3PCF
Finally, we are going to introduce the so-called reduced bispectrum, which is derived from the
regular bispectrum and matter power spectrum via the following relation, written below
Q=B
P1P2+P2P3+P1P3, (5.22)
where Pi=Pm(ki). We plot the relation between the bispectrum of large and small cosmological
volumes in figure 5.12. It is easy to notice that for smaller wavenumber ( k1= 5), relation
between Q(k1, k2, k3) for both the cases has a mean value ≈1.9 for all bins of angle θ(where itsChapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 88

maximum value is θ=π, which is the angle between two sides of triangle k1andk2). In contrast,
when considering a relatively big k1(in our case, it is k1= 6h/Mpc), the deviation between the
reduced bispectrum of a large Lboxand that of a small Lboxis small. This can be attributed to
the fact that the range of wavenumbers is shifted towards higher values. Conversely, in the first
scenario, where k1= 5h/Mpc, the wave numbers were at the limit of the box size for the smaller
simulation, resulting in distorted outcomes and causing the deviation to grow.

5.6.2 2PCF for f(Q)gravitation
In addition to the matter power spectrum/reduced bispectrum and halo mass function, we derive
the two-point correlation function (further - just 2PCF) in a real space for CDM halos. Generally,
2PCF is defined as follows
ξ(|x1−x2|) =⟨δm(x1)δm(x2)⟩, (5.23)
where xiis three-dimensional position of an i-th CDM halo and δmis CDM overdensity parameter.
We show the monopole redshift-space distorted two-point correlation functions for both large
and small simulations boxes on the figure 5.13, where we added Quijote simulations [ 264] 2PCF,
that admits Planck ΛCDM cosmology. We additionally marked BAO bumps for each case with
color-coded dotted lines for completeness. It is obvious, that in the case of a small simulation
box size, the permitted range of Ris very small (up to R≈2×100h−1Mpc) and because of the
small box size, the correlation function is undersampled and does not coincide with the Quijote
one. On the other hand, for LBox= 100 h−1Mpc simulation, the correlation function corresponds
to the Quijote one with sub-percent accuracy for the range R∈[2×100,101]. Now, we can
proceed to the latest topic of our consideration, namely two-dimensional power spectra.Chapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 90

the scale, at which the BAO bump occurs.
5.6.3 2D matter power spectrum
We plot the two-dimensional matter power spectrum for small and large boxes in figure 5.14
with/without redshift-space distortions. As one can easily notice, on the plots with RSDs,
the so-called “Finger of God” effect is observed13, which arises because of the large scatter of
galaxies’ recessional velocities at the small scales. Also, it is worth informing that 2D matter
power spectra for both box sizes are similar. Now, since we discussed all of the topics for both
simulation volumes within the modified theory of gravitation, we can proceed to the concluding
remarks on the key findings within our study.
5.7 Conclusions
One can describe gravity using several geometric bases. The STEGR, which attributes gravity
to the non-metricity tensor, has recently drawn much attention. A fascinating method for
studying modified gravity is f(Q) gravity, an extension of STGR. This study examined large-
scale structure formation observables using N-body simulations of f(Q) gravitation for the first
time to assess the theory’s validity in the cosmological context. Simulations were run with the
use of ME-GADGET code, modification of the widely known GADGET-2 code for two simulation
boxes, namely LBox= 10h−1Mpc and LBox= 100 h−1Mpc to decide on the optimal box size and
compare the results for both simulation volumes.
13At smaller scales, there is a significant scattering in the velocity of galaxies. This dispersion, in addition to
the cosmological redshift, contributes to a broader distribution of redshift values. Consequently, the elongation of
the galaxy distribution along the line of sight occurs, leading to a weakened correlation between galaxies. This
phenomenon is commonly referred to as the Finger of God effect.Chapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 91

Figure 5.14: Two-dimensional matter power spectrum for small and large simulations within
f(Q) gravitation with/without RSDs.
We first performed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for our exponential f(Q)
model to obtain best-fit values of free parameters in section 5.3. To test the fits provided by
MCMC, we obtained theoretical predictions for the dimensionless mass densities Ω m0and Ω Λ0,
the Hubble parameter H(z), deceleration parameter q(z) and statefinder pair {r, s},Om(z)
parameter, placing graphical results on the figures 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5, respectively. As we noticed,
the Hubble parameter respected low redshift observations, and the deceleration parameter
provided correct values of q0and transitional redshift within the constrained range. Moreover,
statefinder diagnostics predict that the Universe was initially in the Quintessence phase, passing
the ΛCDM state and returned to Quintessence again. Finally, Om(z) demonstrated that at the
high- zrange, our Universe was filled with phantom fluid, passed ΛCDM EoS at z≈2 and now
again has a phantom equation of state. After theoretical predictions, we started working on the
N-body simulations whose primary findings corresponding to the quantities of interest are as
follows:
•Three-dimensional matter power spectrum monopole Pk: This was the first probe of aChapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 92
large-scale structure we studied in the present work. We plotted non-linear matter power
spectra (with/without RSDs) for both small and large simulation volumes on the figures
5.8 and 5.11, respectively, where we plotted CAMB linear/non-linear ΛCDM power spectra
and observational data from Ly- αforest for the sake of comparison. One can notice that
within the permitted range of wavenumber k(limited by mean inter-particle separation
and simulation box length), non-linear matter power spectra from small/large N-body
simulations coincide with the CAMB one. However, for LBox= 10h−1Mpc, non-linear Pk
coincide with linear CAMB prediction too early because of the small box size.
•Halo Mass Function: the second significant quantity that can solely conclude the validity
of a simulation. We place Seth-Tormen’s theoretical HMF and the ones extracted from
our N-body simulations in figure 5.9. As we found, our small box size cannot provide
sufficient halo masses and reproduce viable halo mass function at all mass ranges up to
the resolution limit, while large simulation follows Seth-Tormen prediction very precisely
within the large span of halo masses log10M/M ⊙∈[10,14], but gets slightly smaller than
the theoretical prediction for higher masses.
•Two-Point Correlation Function monopole ξ0(r): we also investigated the redshift-space dis-
torted correlation function monopoles in figure 5.13, where Quijote simulations correlation
function is plotted to compare our results to fiducial ΛCDM cosmology. As remarked during
numerical analysis, small box simulation fails to predict correct CDM halo correlations.
On the other hand, in the range, R∈[2×100,101]h−1Mpc large box simulation precisely
reconstructs Quijote data.
•Reduced bispectrum Q(k1, k2, k3): for the reduced bispectra case, we plotted the relation
(QLarge−QSmall)/QSmall with different k1values (which acts as a triangle side length) in
figure 5.12. We observed that this relation is generally close to ≈1.5 across all bins of
the angle between k1andk2(namely θ) if one assumes the value of k1that is not on the
resolution limit for both cases (while it is worth to notice that we only adopted the case,
where k2= 2k1).
•Two-dimensional matter power spectrum Pm(k∥, k⊥): This is the last quantity extracted
from our N-body simulations. We plotted 2D power spectra for both simulations in figure
5.14 with/without redshift-space distortions. From the plots, we noticed the so-called
“Finger of God” effect in the RSD case because of the elongated positions of CDM halos.
In conclusion, considering all the above points, the small simulation volume experiment failed to
recreate the matter power spectrum and correlation function correctly. However, the second one,
namely more extensive N-body simulation provided both viable 3D/2D matter power spectrum,
correlation function, and halo mass functions and, therefore, we can consider exponential f(Q)
model to be a viable substitution of ΛCDM cosmology, since it not only satisfies many largeChapter 5. On the Impact of f(Q)Gravity on the Large Scale Structure 93
scale structure constraints mentioned above but also provide correct distance modulus up to
high redshift values, where ΛCDM fails.
In future works, it will be interesting to investigate this modified gravity model using hybrid N-
body and SPH simulations that incorporate supernova/AGN feedback, star and galaxy formation,
jets, etc. using code GIZMO that allows the use of tabulated Hubble parameter and the effective
gravitational constant. It will, however, require a lot more computational resources (on the scale
of millions of CPU hours).Chapter 6
Conclusions and Future Perspectives
Let us take a moment to summarise the findings brought to light by this thesis. The primary
objective of this thesis is to examine the development of dark energy models to assess the
compatibility of our cosmological theories with observational evidence, intending further to
understand the phenomenon of accelerated expansion in the Universe. We need access to a
diverse range of independent methods to evaluate and validate our theories and models.
In chapter 1, we discussed the mathematical notations, fundamental elements, applications in
cosmology, fundamental theories of gravity, and cosmological observations. Aside from this, it
is well-known that the fundamental theory of gravity, like general relativity, fails to address
certain issues, such as fine-tuning and the flatness problem. Therefore, its modifications and
generalizations are more effective in addressing these concerns, and the chapter concludes with a
summary of the modified gravity theories.
Let us discuss the results obtained in this dissertation. In chapter 2, we developed a dark energy
model using the effective equation of state in f(R,T) gravity. Since the precise form of viscosity
is unknown, we considered a parametrized bulk viscosity consisting of three linear terms. The
first term is a constant, while the second and third are proportional to the Hubble parameter
and¨a
˙a, respectively. Using the observational datasets: 57 points of Hubble data and 580 points of
Union 2.1 supernovae, we examined the model’s viability and discussed the evolution of various
cosmological parameters. We observed a transition in the deceleration parameter from positive to
negative at z= 0.84 and z= 0.62 with q=−0.78 and q=−0.68 for k4=−0.43 and k4= 0.49,
respectively. It is also seen that as z→ −1,ω→ −1, Universe approaches ΛCDM in the near
future. Additionally, we found that the incorporation of bulk viscosity supported a decelerated
expansion in the past and an accelerated expansion in the present. We presented the validation
tests for our model using statefinder diagnostics and energy conditions. We discovered that
the current paradigm satisfies the NEC and DEC but violates the SEC when describing cosmic
acceleration. Moreover, statefinder diagnostics allowed us to observe our model’s deviation from
94Chapter 6. Conclusions 95
the ΛCDM. According to the r−splane, the current model lies in the Chaplygin gas region
and resembles the ΛCDM or may be quintessence in the future. This indicates that the current
model is distinct from the ΛCDM at present.
Consideration of non-minimal coupling of the non-metricity Qand the trace of the energy-
momentum tensor T, i.e., f(Q,T) gravity, is another way to go beyond GR. Chapter 3 examined
thef(Q,T) theory, according to which dark energy is solely geometric. However, there is
no doubt that the coupling should have a positive value to reproduce the solar system scale.
Employing MCMC techniques, we have addressed f(Q,T) gravity using f(Q,T) =ξ Qn+bTin
a matter-dominated Universe. The 57 Hubble data points and 580 points of Union 2.1 supernovae
data points were used to reconstruct the dark sector as a function of redshift. The deceleration
parameter appears negative, which is consistent with the current scenario of an accelerating
Universe. The statefinder parameters exhibit a quintessence phase and converge to ΛCDM
in the future using the constrained values of the model parameters nandbderived from the
datasets. However, the linear model f(Q,T) =ξ Q+bTresembles the power-law expansion
model a(t)∝(B t+c1)1/B, where B=24π+3b
16π+3b. One can notice that the model behaves similar
to the standard lore of a(t)∝t2/3with a constant deceleration of q= 0.5. Hence, it reveals that
the model parameter bcontributes less to the evolution, suggesting that the linear trace does
not affect the evolution much.
To study more on the contribution of the linear trace, the parameterized equation of state in
f(Q,T) gravity is considered in chapter 4 which represents an additional theoretical scenario
beyond GR. The Pantheon sample was used to constrain the parameter space {b, m, n }, as the
functional form fincludes bas a model parameter, while mandnare the parameters of the
considered parametrized equation of state. The bounds on the parameter space for our analysis
areb= 0.2+2.7
−2.9,m= 0.47+0.27
−0.21, and n= 3.2+1.8
−2.0. Further, we focus on the neighborhood of b= 0,
which seeks to identify any deviation from GR. It is seen that the approach does not result in a
statistically significant difference between the marginalized distributions of parameters mandn.
Lastly, we observed the behavior of the deceleration parameter, which demonstrates a transition
from deceleration to acceleration with q0=−0.52. In addition, value of the EoS parameter at
z= 0 is ω0=−0.68+0.10
−0.11, which supports a phase of acceleration. Henceforth, to the cosmic
evidence, we must ensure that the f(Q,T) theory is stable to perform the perturbation level
difference in approach to ΛCDM.
In chapter 5, we focused on the extension of the newly proposed geometrical framework of
GR, named as the f(Q) gravity. We proposed and investigated the structure formation and
viable cosmology for exponential f(Q) gravity. However, we provided cosmological constraints
for the model using Hubble data, a reduced Pantheon sample, and the BAO dataset. In order
to compare our model with ΛCDM model results, we conducted AIC and BIC analysis. We
obtained that there is a strong evidence in favor of our f(Q) gravity model. We observed thatChapter 6. Conclusions 96
the deceleration parameter provided a consistent value of q0and a transition within the allowed
range. We discovered that the statefinder diagnostics initially predicted quintessence behavior,
then the ΛCDM state, and then quintessence behavior again.
After theoretical predictions, N-body simulations were conducted. We investigated the 3D
monopole power-spectrum using small/large N-body simulations, coincides with CAMB one
within the permitted range of wavenumber, whereas for Lbox= 10 h−1Mpc, non-linear Pk
coincides with linear CAMB prediction too early due to the small box size. Then, we moved
on to the second significant number, the Halo mass function, that alone can determine the
viability of simulations. We found that the small box size could not provide enough halo masses
to produce a valid halo mass function at all mass ranges up to the resolution limit. In contrast,
the large simulation follows the Seth-Tormen prediction precisely within the large span of halo
masses log10M/M ⊙∈[10,14] but gets slightly smaller than the theoretical prediction at higher
masses. In addition, we examined the redshift-space distorted correlation function monopoles,
where the correlation function from the Quijote simulations is plotted in order to compare our
results to fiducial cosmology. Observations indicate that small box simulation fails to predict
CDM halo correlations accurately. In contrast, R∈[2×100,101]h−1Mpc large box simulation
precisely reconstructs Quijote data in the range. Moreover, 2D power spectra were depicted for
both simulations with and without redshift-space distortions. We observed the so-called “Finger
of God” effect in the RSD case due to the elongated CDM halo positions.
This chapter concludes that the small simulation volume experiment did not recreate the matter
power spectrum and correlation function. Nevertheless, a realistic 3D/2D matter power spectrum,
correlation function, and halo mass function were obtained from the second, more extended
N-body simulation. The exponential f(Q) model may therefore be viewed as an alternative to
the fiducial ΛCDM cosmology, as it not only satisfies the above-mentioned large-scale structure
constraints but also provides correct distance modulus up to high redshift values, where ΛCDM
fails.
As observed, the theories of gravitational extension and modification, which effectively incorporate
advanced observations and attract the cosmological community’s interest, do not seem to alter
the foundations of GR. Gravity is still classical and is related to the geometry of spacetime.
These findings indicate that we are not at an endpoint. In the future, several large-scale surveys,
such as the dark energy spectroscopic instrument (DESI), Square kilometer array (SKA), and
the large-aperture synoptic survey telescope (LSST), will cover the entire redshift range in which
accelerated expansion played a significant role over the next decade. We will use the newly
collected observational data to investigate the H0andσ8tensions in these modified theories of
gravity. In anticipation of having actual data, forecast analysis enhances our understanding of
cosmology.References

ME-GADGET
When considering the simulation technique, it is crucial to acknowledge four significant distinctions
from the ΛCDM simulation [ 284]. Firstly, the expansion rate of the Universe, denoted as H(a),
shall be modified accordingly. Secondly, the interaction of energy exchange between dark matter
and dark energy, as well as the mass of the simulated particles that represent the energy density of
dark matter, ought to be modified in accordance with the scale factor. Thirdly, in the simulation,
the particles experience an increase in drag force due to their interaction with the background
dark energy field. Lastly, the additional gravitational force caused by the perturbation of the
dark energy field can be treated as an effective gravitational constant. As a result, the DM
particles in the simulations will experience an additional force, also called the fifth force. The
fifth force is caused by the perturbation of DE. Hence, the fifth force can be understood as a
modification to the Poisson equation in harmonic space, as computed by the modified CAMB.
These four modifications were carried out in the original N-body simulation code GADGET2,
resulting in a modified version referred to as ME-GADGET.
CCVT Algorithm
The methodology involves initializing a random distribution of Npparticles within the designated
region R, followed by an iterative relaxation process to achieve a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation
(CCVT) distribution [ 285]. To satisfy the first constraint of the CCVT distribution, we use Ns
spatial points to uniformly sample the region Rand assign c=Ns/Npof them to each particle.
Subsequently, a fraction of these points is allocated to each particle. Using this approach, an
assignment A is generated where each particle is allocated an equal number of spatial locations,
denoted as the capacity cfor every particle. In the subsequent relaxing phase, the capacity of
each particle remains constant while solely altering the specific assignment. It should be noted
that in the first assignment, spatial locations can be arbitrarily allocated to particles, provided
that each particle receives an equal capacity. In order to accelerate the process of relaxing, it
109Appendices 110
is advisable to employ an initial assignment that is compact based on the distance between
particles in spatial points.
Empirical evidence has demonstrated that the CCVT distribution is associated with the minimal
value of the energy function, that is
E=X
i∈Ns|xi−rj=A(i)|2, (6.1)
where rjandxiare the coordinates of the j−thparticle and i−thspatial point respectively.
The assignment function A(i) tells us the index of the particle that the i−thspatial point is
assigned to. Hence, the relaxing process can be understood as minimizing the energy function
associated with the system comprising particles and spatial points. It should be noted that
the energy function computation can readily accommodate the periodic boundary condition.
Consequently, the CCVT configuration possesses periodicity and can be seamlessly employed in
cosmological simulations.
Tools of Large-Scale Structure
This section describes the theoretical frameworks that provide the link between the current
cosmological model and observed structure in the present day Universe [ 289]. Consider some
component of the Universe whose energy density ρ(⃗ r, t) is a function of position as well as time.
At a given t, the spatially averaged energy density is
ρ(t) =1
VZ
Vρ(⃗ r, t)d3r. (6.2)
The volume Vover which we are averaging must be large compared to the size of the biggest
structure in the Universe. It is useful to define a dimensionless density fluctuations
δ(⃗ r, t) =ρ(⃗ r, t)−ρ(t)
ρ(t). (6.3)
The value of δis thus negative in underdense regions and positive in overdense regions.
An attempt to describe the physics of structure formation is concerned with the statistical rather
than the individual properties of the distribution of density perturbations. We can expand the
dimensionless density enhancement at some position ⃗ ras a three-dimensional Fourier series
defined as
δ(⃗ r) =V
(2π)3Z
δ⃗ke−i⃗k.⃗ rd3k, (6.4)Appendices 111
where the individual Fourier components δ⃗kare given by
δ⃗k=1
VZ
δ(⃗ r)ei⃗k.⃗ rd3k. (6.5)
When conducting the Fourier transform, the function δ(⃗ r) is decomposed into an infinite number
of sine waves, each with comoving wavenumber ⃗kand comoving wavelength λ=2π
k. When
|δ⃗k| ≪ 1, each Fourier component obeys the perturbation equation. In this scenario, the
perturbation equation for gravity governed by the function f(Q) is employed.
The power spectrum is defined as the mean square of the Fourier components, that is
P(k) =⟨|δ⃗k|2⟩, (6.6)
where the average is taken over all possible orientations of the wavenumber ⃗k.
The most effective approach for identifying low-amplitude overdensities on a spatial scale of
160 Mpc involves analyzing the correlation function of galaxies. The correlation function ξ(r)
is a quantitative measure indicating the expected number of probable galaxies to be observed
inside a certain infinitesimal volume dV. The expected dNis given by the relation
dN=ng[1 +ξ(r)]dV, (6.7)
where ngis the average number of galaxies at the present day. So, the correlation function ξ(r)
is the Fourier transform of the power spectrum P(k)
ξ(r) =V
(2π)3Z
P(k)e−i⃗k.⃗ rd3k. (6.8)
Redshift-Space Distortion Effect
Redshift-space distortions (RSD) are a phenomenon in observational cosmology where the spatial
distribution of galaxies appears distorted when their positions are viewed as a function of their
redshift in contrast to their distances [ 286–288]. The distribution of galaxies in observations is
known to deviate from that in real space due to the peculiar velocity of each galaxy, resulting
in the redshift space distortion (RSD) phenomenon. Since we cannot calculate the percentage
of the measured velocity that arises from the Hubble flow or from the peculiar velocity, the
resulting distance measurement becomes inaccurate by a certain value, denoted as ∆ D, that is
D=vHubble +vpec
H0=Dreal+ ∆D. (6.9)Appendices 112
Therefore, it is necessary to examine the disparity in the power spectrum between actual space
and redshift space in both three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) contexts. The
Pylians python package is employed to compute the overdensity of dark matter, both with and
without redshift-space distortions (RSD).
