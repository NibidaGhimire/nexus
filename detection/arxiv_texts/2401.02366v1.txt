Exploring the molecular fragmentation dynamics induced by low-energy electrons offers com-
pelling insights into the complex interplay between the projectile and target. In this study, we
investigate the phenomenon of dissociative electron attachment to ethyl acetate. The recorded
yields of various fragment anions within an incident electron energy range of 1 to 13 eV reveal
a diverse array of products with six different mass numbers. Examples include (M −H)−, CH−
3,
C2H5O−, CH 3CO−, CH 2CHO−, and CH 3COO−, formed through the fracture of single bonds. In-
terestingly, the generation of other fragments, such as HCCO−, suggests a more intricate structural
rearrangement of the nuclei, adding a layer of complexity to the observed dissociation dynamics.

I. INTRODUCTION
Low-energy electron collisions with molecules are cru-
cial processes in various scientific fields. They play a
vital role in dissociation processes in the upper atmo-
sphere and are also responsible for ozone layer depletion
[1]. Additionally, damage to living cells by nuclear radi-
ation is primarily caused by low-energy secondary elec-
trons, which are produced by high-energy primary beams
through different processes such as ionization and mul-
tiple collisions. The single- and double-strand breaks of
DNA are primarily caused by the impact of these low-
energy secondary electrons through dissociative electron
attachment (DEA) [2]. DEA is the dominant process
leading to the dissociation of molecules in low-energy
electron collisions that have been experimentally ob-
served. It is a two-step resonant process; in the first
step, the incoming electron resonantly attaches to the
molecule, producing a temporary negative ion (TNI). In
the subsequent step, the TNI dissociates, producing an
anionic fragment along with one or more neutral frag-
ments [3, 4].
Ethyl acetate is among the simplest esters, a class of com-
pounds derived from acids where the hydrogen atom of
at least one acidic hydroxyl group ( −OH) of that acid
is replaced by an organyl group ( −R). Esters are ubiq-
uitous in nature and find extensive use in various indus-
tries. The pleasant aroma of many fruits, for instance,
can be attributed to the presence of esters. Fats, on the
other hand, are primarily triesters derived from glycerol
and fatty acids, with glycerides representing fatty acid
esters of glycerol and lactones being cyclic carboxylic es-
ters. Ethyl acetate itself is a colorless liquid with a sweet,
∗ †sptasins@nd.edu;∗dchakra2@nd.edufruity odor that is generally well-received. It serves as
a widely used solvent, particularly in the production of
paints, varnishes, lacquers, cleaning mixtures, and per-
fumes [5–7]. Additionally, it is employed as a solvent in
processes such as decaffeinating coffee beans and in col-
umn and thin-layer chromatography in laboratory set-
tings [8, 9]. Furthermore, it serves as an asphyxiant for
insect collection for study purposes. Industrially, ethyl
acetate is primarily synthesized through the classic Fis-
cher esterification reaction involving ethanol and acetic
acid.
Due to its widespread usage in industry, ethyl acetate has
been detected in the atmosphere, making it a potential
source of CO 2[10]. Therefore, it is important to study
its decomposition in the atmosphere through the inter-
action with low-energy electrons. Despite its extensive
use in research and industry, there has been no study on
DEA to ethyl acetate to date [5–9]. Additionally, only
a few reports exist on DEA to esters [11–13]. Feketeov´ a
et al. [12] investigated the DEA dynamics of methyl ac-
etate by measuring the yields of various fragment anions
as a function of incident electron energies. They observed
that these fragment anions were produced from one shape
resonance at approximately 2.5 eV, along with several
Feshbach resonances in the range of 6 - 12 eV electron
energy. Pariat and Allan explored the DEA dynamics of
methyl acetate by measuring the yields of different frag-
ment anions [11]. They identified one shape resonance
near 3 eV and three higher energy Feshbach resonances
in the 6-12 eV range. Several anionic fragments were
observed, including CH−
3, CH 3CO−, CH 3O−, HCCO−,
CHO−, CH 2COO−and CH 2COOCH−
3ions. They pro-
posed a mechanism for the production of HCCO−, in-
volving the rapid stabilization of the primary resonance
by the loss of an H-atom, followed by a slower process
of proton transfer. The HCCO−anions produced due
to low-energy electron collisions can act as a source ofarXiv:2401.02366v1  [physics.atm-clus]  4 Jan 20242
CO 2. These anions react with molecular oxygen, pro-
ducing CO 2[11].
II. EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL
METHODS
The experimental setup used to obtain ion-yield curves
for negative ions has been previously detailed [14]. In the
context of this present study, it will be briefly discussed.
The experiment was conducted within an ultrahigh vac-
uum chamber with a base pressure of 1 ×10−10mbar,
using a QMS by Hiden Analytical, specifically from the
3F series, commercially known as an ion desorption probe
(IDP). In the present context, the system was employed
for gas-phase detection of anions. An effusive beam of
gas-phase molecules interacted with low-energy electrons
generated by the oxide-coated iridium filament within the
QMS. The filament emitted electrons through thermionic
emission with controlled energy, typically at an intensity
of 2.5 µA. When the low-energy electrons interacted with
the molecules, negative fragment ions were produced and
collected by a secondary electron multiplier detector with
a selected mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Energy scans were
conducted from 1 to 13 eV, with 0.1 eV increments for
each negative fragment generated through the DEA pro-
cess. These energy scans were executed using MASsoft
version 7 professional software provided by Hiden. The
energy resolution of the electron beam used in the ex-
periment was 0.5 eV. The chamber was baked at 363 K
for several days before introducing the sample to reduce
signals originating from contamination and background
gases already present in the chamber. The electron en-
ergy scale was calibrated using the resonant peak of O−
from DEA to O 2[15]. Energy calibration was performed
both before and after conducting the experiment. The
experiments were carried out using 99.5% pure ethyl ac-
etate samples from Sigma Aldrich, USA, which is liquid
at room temperature. The sample was introduced from
a glass container located outside the chamber and was
transported to the interaction region through a pipeline
connection. The pipeline was linked to an internal cap-
illary within the vacuum chamber that guided the gas-
phase sample to the QMS aperture. The sample under-
went freeze-pump-thaw cycles several times to eliminate
contaminants before being introduced into the vacuum
chamber. The chamber pressure during the experiment
was maintained at approximately 1.5 ×10−6mbar. The
experiment was repeated multiple times for each frag-
ment, and the results were consistent in each case.
Quantum chemical calculations were conducted using the
GAUSSIAN 16 software [16]. Thermodynamic thresh-
old energies for each dissociation channel were deter-
mined using the composite W1 method, [17] employing
the B3LYP functional [18] and the flexible cc-pVTZ ba-
sis set [19] for geometry optimizations and basic ther-
mochemistry. These calculations were complemented by
a series of correlation corrections[20] to ensure high-levelaccuracy. The threshold energy for a specific dissociation
channel of ethyl acetate was determined by calculating
the bond dissociation energies involved and the electron
affinity of the fragment.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A total of six different mass fragments at 15, 41, 43,
45, 59, and 87 amu have been found due to the low-
energy electron collision with ethyl acetate. It is im-
portant to note that six different mass numbers do not
necessarily indicate the presence of six distinct fragment
anions. Due to the complexity of the fragmentation pro-
cess, anions with different molecular structures but with
the same mass number are possible. The assignment of
these masses to various fragment anions is provided in
Table I.
It is important to note that the production of the frag-
ments CH−
3, CH 3CO−, C2H5O−, CH 3COO−, and the H-
loss anions [(M −H)−] can be attributed to single bond
breaking. In contrast, the generation of HCCO−and
CH 2CHO−involves multiple bond breaking and/or com-
plex structural rearrangement. The absence of C 2H−
5
ions can be explained by the negative electron affinity
of C 2H5. For reference, the electron affinities of the neu-
tral counterparts of several fragment anions are provided
in Table II.
In the following sections, we will first examine the ions
generated through single bond breaking or direct dissoci-
ation. Subsequently, we will delve into the production of
ions that necessitate complex structural rearrangements.
We obtained the negative-ion yields of different fragment
anions produced from DEA to ethyl acetate as a function
of incident electron energy ranging from 1 to 13 eV, and
the resulting fragment anions, along with their respec-
tive assignments and resonance positions, are provided
in Table I.
A. Production of H-loss anions [(M −H)−] (M = 87)
The yield of (M −H)−ions, as a function of electron
energy during DEA to ethyl acetate, is depicted in Fig.
1. This ion yield exhibits a prominent peak centered
around 2.7 eV that can be attributed to resonance with
a possible π∗character. The previous photoabsorption
study on ethyl acetate indicates that the lowest unoccu-
pied molecular orbital (LUMO) predominantly exhibits
π∗antibonding character and is localized on the C=O
bond [21]. Consequently, during the attachment, the
incoming electron can be captured by the unoccupied
π∗(C=O) orbital, leading to the formation of the TNI
state, which subsequently dissociates, producing various
fragment anions. In the current investigation, the ob-
served resonance at 2.7 eV is attributed to this π∗shape
resonance . In a previous study of DEA to methyl ac-
etate, a similar resonance in this energy range was also3

identified and attributed to a π∗resonance [11]. In
the context of the TNI state, three distinct dissocia-
tion channels leading to fragment anions with the same
mass number but different molecular structures are pos-
sible, depending on the site of H-loss. These three H-loss
anions are CH 2COOCH 2CH−
3, CH 3COOCH 2CH−
2, and
CH 3COOCHCH−
3. The first one is formed by breaking
a C−H bond from the methyl group. In contrast, the
second and third ones are generated by breaking a C −H
bond within the CH 3and CH 2groups, respectively, of
the ethyl moiety. These ions are exclusively produced
through the cleavage of a single C −H bond. The possi-
ble dissociation channels responsible for producing these
H-loss anions can be represented as follows:
(CH 3COOC 2H5)∗−→CH 2COOCH 2CH−
3+ H (1a)
→CH 3COOCH 2CH−
2+ H (1b)
→CH 3COOCHCH−
3+ H (1c)
Our theoretical investigation indicates that
CH 3COOCH 2CH−
2ions in channel (1b) are inher-
ently unstable and undergo spontaneous dissociation,
yielding a CH 3COO−ion along with a neutral conju-
gate of CH 2CH 2(Channel 5b). Consequently, in the
current context, channel (1b) can be disregarded for the
generation of (M −H)−ions. The calculated threshold
energies for channels (1a) and (1c) are 2.55 and 3.83 eV,
respectively.

As we investigated the H-loss channels, the anticipa-
tion was to observe conjugate dissociation channels in-
volving the formation of H−ions in this energy range.
However, our current experimental limitations prevent
us from verifying this expectation. The QMS spectrome-
ter used in this experiment lacks the capability to detect
H−ions.
B. Production of CH−
3ions (M = 15)
Fig. 2 illustrates the ion yield curve of CH−
3ions re-
sulting from DEA to ethyl acetate. A broad range of
overlapping resonances, spanning from 6 eV to 12 eV, is
observed, accompanied by a hump near 5.7 eV. To locate
the correct positions of these overlapping resonances, we
opted to fit the CH−
3ion yield using multiple Gaussian
functions, as depicted in Fig. 2. The fitted ion yield
curve indicates the likely presence of three closely situ-
ated resonant states in the 6 to 12 eV region, peaking
at 7.3, 8.5, and 10.1 eV, respectively. However, due to
the limited energy resolution of the electron beam and
the finite width of the resonances, it is not feasible to
distinctly separate them in the present study.
In order to have an insight into these different resonances,
we compare them to the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) pho-
toabsorption study [21]. The study suggests the existence
of an absorption band in the vicinity of 5.9 eV, attributed
to the HOMO →π∗(C=O) transition. Additionally, the
authors anticipate the occurrence of multiple Rydberg
transitions spanning the 6.5-10 eV range, as shown in Fig.
2. These Rydberg states are proposed to serve as parent
states for the DEA resonances observed in the present
investigation. Therefore, through comparison with the
prior report, the four DEA resonances identified within4
FIG. 2. The VUV photoabsorption spectrum of ethyl acetate
was extracted from the previous report (CC BY) [21]. This
spectrum reveals the presence of four absorption bands within
the 5-10 eV energy region. The ion yield of CH−
3ions pro-
duced due to DEA to ethyl acetate in the energy range of 1-13
eV is also presented at the bottom. The blue dots represent
the experimental data points, and the black solid curve indi-
cates the cumulative fitted curve with four Gaussian functions
attributed to four resonant bands. One exponential function
is also shown to incorporate the contribution of the IP dissoci-
ation process. The fitting suggests that the structure present
in the 5-12 eV range is a combination of four resonant states
with energies at 5.7, 7.3, 8.5, and 10.1 eV.
the 5 to 12 eV energy range are likely to be core-excited
Feshbach resonances. The first band in the photoabsorp-
tion spectra, which peaks at approximately 5.9 eV, may
serve as the parent state for the weak resonance detected
at 5.7 eV. Likewise, the second band, reaching its peak
at about 7.7 eV, could be the parent state for the sharp
resonance identified at 7.3 eV. Similarly, the remaining
two bands, with peaks around 8.8 eV and 9.8 eV, respec-
tively, may correspond to the parent states for resonances
at 8.5 eV and 10.1 eV. A comparison between the VUV
photoabsorption spectrum [21] and the CH−
3ion yield is
depicted in Fig. 2.
The CH−
3formation from ethyl acetate could be through
a simple two-body dissociation process either from the
methyl site or from the ethyl moiety, as shown by the
following reaction channels.
(CH 3COOC 2H5)∗−→CH−
3+ COOC 2H5 (2a)
→CH−
3+ CH 3COOCH 2 (2b)In channel (2a), CH−
3ions are produced from the −CH 3
site, while in channel (2b), CH−
3ions are produced
from the −C2H5moiety. The theoretically calculated
threshold values for these channels are 4.01 and 3.81
eV, respectively, rendering both channels relevant to
the DEA process. However, it is intriguing to explore
whether three-body or even higher-order dissociation
of the TNI is possible. To be transparent, the present
measurements do not provide a conclusive answer to
this question. Nevertheless, by examining the resonance
positions, we can speculate that the 5.7 eV resonance
primarily involves two-body dissociation, whereas the
7.3, 8.5, and 10.1 eV resonances may either undergo two-
body dissociation with significantly high rovibrational
excited fragments or involve three-body or higher-order
dissociations. The higher values of excess available
energy in the dissociation process contribute to this
complexity. To offer a definitive answer, measuring the
kinetic energy of the CH−
3fragments would be necessary,
which goes beyond the scope of the present study.
In this context, it is worth mentioning that if the

production of CH−
3occurs due to the breaking of
the H 3C−COOC 2H5bond, there should also be a
possibility of producing COOC 2H−
5ions. Conversely,
if CH−
3ions are produced due to the breaking of the
CH 3COOCH 2−CH 3bond, there should be a chance of
producing CH 3COOCH−
2ions. Both COOC 2H−
5and
CH 3COOCH−
2have a mass of 73, which is absent from
our mass spectra. Our theoretical calculations suggest
that the former ion spontaneously dissociates to produce
one C 2H5O−ion and one CO molecule (Channel 3b).
However, CH 3COOCH−
2is a stable species with a pos-
itive electron affinity. The computed threshold energy5
for the production of this anion is 3.36 eV. The absence
of CH 3COOCH−
2in our results may be due to either the
CH 3COOCH 2−CH 3bond not breaking to produce CH−
3
ions or if the CH 3COOCH 2−CH 3bond is breaking,
CH 3COOCH−
2is not being produced. However, electron
affinity calculations suggest that the electron affinity
of CH 3(0.029 eV) is lower than that of CH 3COOCH 2
(0.478 eV). This implies that the probability of produc-
ing CH 3COOCH−
2should be higher than that of CH−
3.
This observation likely indicates the non-dissociative
nature of the CH 3COOCH 2−CH 3bond upon electron
attachment to ethyl acetate. Hence, the observed CH−
3
ions are coming from the H 3C−COOC 2H5dissociation
(Channel 2a). A similar observation was reported in a
previous study on DEA of methyl acetate molecules [11].
By comparing the ion yields with deuterated methyl
acetate, the authors experimentally demonstrated that
the formation of CH−
3is favored through dissociation
from the H 3C−COOCH 3site.
A continuous increase in ion counts with increasing in-
cident electron energy is observed above 11 eV. This be-
havior is due to the involvement of the CH−
3ions formed
due to the ion pair (IP) dissociation [22, 23]. For other
fragment anions, the threshold of the IP states lies above
14 eV, hence absent in the measured ion yield. However,
that is not the case for the CH−
3ions, where the cal-
culated IP threshold lies around 11.1 eV. The CH−
3ion
yield feature at higher energies agrees with our theoret-
ically calculated IP threshold. It is worth investigating
why the IP states present near 11.1 eV dissociate through
producing the CH−
3ions only. At the present moment,
we do not have any explanation behind this. Another
striking observation is the presence of IP states at such
low energy, which is not so common and observed only for
a few investigations until now [24]. Two possible chan-
nels producing CH−
3ions through the IP dissociation are
listed below:
e−+ CH 3COOC 2H5→CH−
3+ COOC 2H+
5+e−(2c)
→CH−
3+ CH 3COOCH+
2+e−
(2d)
The theoretically computed threshold values of these two
channels are 11.13 and 11.15 eV, respectively. The over-
lap between the DEA and the IP dissociation is observed
from the CH−
3ion yield. In order to include the contribu-
tion from the IP dissociation into the ion yield, we fitted
it with an exponential function (along with the Gaussian
functions) as shown in Fig. 2.
C. Production of C 2H5O−ions (M = 45)
Fig. 3 illustrates the ion yield of C 2H5O−resulting
from DEA to ethyl acetate. A distinct and intense peak is
observed at 3 eV, accompanied by two broad resonances
peaking at 7.3 and 9.9 eV. Due to the broad nature

ture present in the 3.0 eV region is due to the contribution of

tion of two core-excited Feshbach resonances peaking at 7.3,
and 9.9 eV.
of these resonant states, the contribution of other res-
onances with a lower cross-section cannot be ruled out in
this energy region. The most straightforward mechanism
for the formation of C 2H5O−ions during the DEA pro-
cess is through the dissociation of the CH 3OC−OC 2H5
bond. This simple two-body dissociation can be repre-
sented as follows:
(CH 3COOC 2H5)∗−→CH 3CO + C 2H5O−(3a)
The calculated threshold energy for this channel is 2.62
eV, making it the only possible candidate for the ob-
served 2.9 eV shape resonance . The experimentally ob-
tained appearance energy aligns well with the computed
threshold energy, considering the resolution of the elec-
tron beam used in the experiment. Regarding the Fesh-
bach resonances within the 6 to 12 eV region, three-body
or even higher-order dissociation might be involved. One
such possible sequential dissociation channel is:
(CH 3COOC 2H5)∗−→CH 3+ COOC 2H−
5
→CH 3+ CO + C 2H5O−(3b)
The calculated threshold energy for this channel is 3.04
eV, making it a potential candidate for the Feshbach res-
onances . This proposed dissociation channel (3b) could
either be a concerted three-body dissociation or a se-
quential dissociation. In order to make this dissociation
channel more relevant, one can relate it to the CH−
3dis-
sociation channel as discussed in section III B. The disso-
ciation of the H 3C−COOC 2H5bond produces CH−

with a neutral COOC 2H5conjugate. This introduces the
possibility of observing COOC 2H−
5ions in the DEA pro-
cess. However, we are unable to detect the presence of
COOC 2H−
5in our measurements. One of the reasons for
this could be its unstable nature or its short lifetime.
Therefore, it is plausible that COOC 2H−
5ions are in-
deed formed in the DEA process, but due to their un-
stable nature, they spontaneously dissociate to produce
CO and C 2H5O−ions. The presence of Feshbach res-
onances within the 6 to 12 eV region for the CH−
3ions
reinforces this conclusion. This observation suggests that
a sequential dissociation of the TNI may involved.
D. Production of CH 3CO−and CH 2CHO−ions (M
= 43)
Fig. 4 depicts the ion yield of mass 43 produced due
to low-energy electron attachment to ethyl acetate. The
presence of Feshbach resonances within the 6 to 12 eV
region is detected. However, no contribution from the
shape resonance is observed for fragments with this mass.
The easiest way to form mass 43 is through a two-body
dissociation by breaking the CH 3OC−OC 2H5bond, re-
sulting in CH 3CO−ions with C 2H5O as the neutral. The
dissociation pathway for this fragment is as follows:
(CH 3COOC 2H5)∗−→CH 3CO−+ C 2H5O (4a)
This is essentially the conjugate dissociation process of
C2H5O−formation (channel 3a), where we observed a
strong signal due to the contribution from the shape res-onance within the 1 to 4 eV energy region (Fig. 3). How-
ever, no ion signal within the 1 to 4 eV region is observed
in the CH 3CO−channel. The higher threshold energy of
this dissociation channel is the reason behind the exclu-
sion of the shape resonance , as we found the computed
threshold energy to be around 3.9 eV.
Another possible contribution for mass 43 could be due
to CH 2CHO−, which requires many-body dissociation
along with structural rearrangements in the TNI. This
dissociation initiates with the production of C 2H5O−,
which simultaneously or sequentially dissociates, produc-
ing CH 2CHO−and H 2. The presence of C 2H5O−ions
within the 6 to 12 eV Feshbach resonance region (Fig. 3)
makes this a candidate dissociation pathway. The only
conceivable reason to exclude this channel could be the
stability of C 2H5O−ions. However, studies on DEA to
ethanol indicate a finite possibility behind the dissocia-
tion of C 2H5O−ions to produce a CH 2CHO−ion and
molecular Hydrogen (H 2) [25, 26]. This process can be
represented as:
(CH 3COOC 2H5)∗−→CH 3CO + C 2H5O−
→CH 3CO + CH 2CHO−+ H 2
(4b)
The computed threshold energy of this channel is 2.74,
which is in agreement with the present experimental re-
sults. The significant difference between the computed
threshold energy and the experimentally observed ap-
pearance energy for this channel implies that the result-
ing fragments will either exhibit high kinetic energy or
exist in significantly elevated rovibrational excited states.
Additionally, the possibility of further sequential dissoci-
ation of the neutrals cannot be ruled out.
E. Production of CH 3COO−ions (M = 59)
The yield of CH 3COO−ions as a function of the elec-
tron energy from DEA to ethyl acetate is depicted in
Fig. 5. Two broad resonances peaking at 3 eV and
9 eV are observed. The higher energy resonant fea-
ture ranges from 6 to 12 eV, indicating the presence
of similar Feshbach resonances observed for other frag-
ments. The simplest way to form the CH 3COO−ion is
through a two-body dissociation channel by breaking the
CH 3COO−C2H5bond. The dissociation channel can be
represented as follows:
(CH 3COOC 2H5)∗−→CH 3COO−+ C 2H5 (5a)
The computed threshold energy for this dissociation
channel is 0.57 eV, making this channel plausible for
the 3 eV resonance. For the higher resonances, three-
body or higher-order dissociation may be involved. In
this context, it is worth mentioning that since the pro-
duction of CH 3COO−occurs due to the breaking of the
CH 3COO−C2H5bond, there should also be a possibility7

structure present in the 3 eV region is due to the contribution

bination of two core-excited Feshbach resonances peaking at
8.9, and 10.2 eV.
of the production of C 2H−
5ions. However, in the present
context, we could not detect any signal for mass 29. Our
theoretical calculation suggests that C 2H5has negative
electron affinity, and thus, the production of C 2H−
5is not
possible in this context.
Another possible dissociation channel for the for-
mation of the CH 3COO−ions is through a sequen-
tial dissociation of the TNI. As mentioned in section
III A, CH 3COOCH 2CH−
2(channel 1b) ion is extremely
unstable and simultaneously dissociates to produce a
CH 3COO−ion with a CH 2CH 2neutral conjugate. The
dissociation mechanism can be represented in the follow-
ing way:
(CH 3COOC 2H5)∗−→CH 3COOCH 2CH−
2+ H
→CH 3COO−+ CH 2CH 2+ H
(5b)
The computed threshold energy for this dissociation
channel is 2.31 eV, making it a candidate for both lower
and higher energy resonances.
F. Production of HCCO−ions (M = 41)
Fig. 6 illustrates the ion yield curve of mass 41 re-
sulting from low-energy electron attachment to ethyl ac-
etate. One small peak near 3.3 eV and a broad peak
near 9.7 eV are observed, along with a small hump near
7 eV. To clearly locate these resonances, we opted to fit
the ion yield with three Gaussian functions, as shown

in Fig. 6. Mass 41 can be attributed to the formation
of HCCO−ions. This is likely the only fragment that
cannot be produced through a single-bond dissociation
process; instead, complex structural rearrangements in
the TNI are essential. Various dissociation channels pro-
ducing HCCO−ions are listed in Table III. In all these
channels, complex structural changes and hydrogen mi-
gration are involved [27]. To elucidate this process, we
can refer to Fig. 7. The formation of HCCO−fragments
can proceed either through C −O dissociation near the
keto site or near the ethyl site. We are discussing the
processes as follows:
1. C−O dissociation near the keto site
In this dissociation channel, molecular H 2forms as a
by-product. The dissociation can occur through a con-
certed three-body process involving structural rearrange-
ments in the TNI. One C −O bond dissociates, two C −H
bonds dissociate from the CH 3C=O site, and a H −H
bond forms during this process. The final dissociated
products of this channel are shown in channel (6a). Alter-
natively, HCCO−can form through a sequential dissocia-
tion process. In the first step, the C −O bond dissociates,
leading to the formation of CH 3CO−and the neutral con-
jugate C 2H5O (as shown in Channel 4a). In the second
step, CH 3CO−further dissociates to form HCCO−and8
FIG. 7. Suggested fragmentation pathways of ethyl acetate producing HCCO−during the DEA process. Structural rearrange-
ments in the molecular anion must occur. The two fragmentation channels on the left show the pathways when the C −O
dissociation occurred near the keto site of the molecule, whereas the right pathway represents when the C −O dissociation
occurs near the ethyl group.
H2. The process can be represented as follows:
(CH 3COOC 2H5)∗−→CH 3CO−+ C 2H5O
→HCCO−+ H 2+ C 2H5O (6a)
The computed threshold for the concerted three-body
dissociation processes is 3.85 eV, indicating that the
3.3 eV shape resonance can not proceed through this
channel. Alternatively, for the intermediate step, the
computed threshold energy is 3.90 eV (channel 4a).
As a result, the formation of HCCO−from the 3.3 eV
shape resonance can be ruled out through the sequential
dissociation channel (6a) as well. This suggests that this
channel (both sequential and concerted) is only relevant
for the 6-12 eV Feshbach resonances .
Another possibility arises from the C 2H5O−fragment.
During the C −O dissociation near the keto site, C 2H5O−
is also a potential fragment (as shown in Channel 3a).
This C 2H5O−ion can sequentially dissociate, producing
the HCCO−ions. In this fragmentation process, four
C−H bonds can dissociate simultaneously, accompanied
by the formation of two H −H bonds. The process can berepresented as follows:
(CH 3COOC 2H5)∗−→CH 3CO + C 2H5O−
→CH 3CO + HCCO−+ 2H 2(6b)
As discussed earlier, this dissociation can occur either as
a concerted process through structural rearrangements
in the TNI or as a sequential dissociation process. The
computed threshold for this dissociation channel is
3.85 eV. Consequently, we can exclude channel (6b) for
the production of HCCO−associated with the 3.3 eV
resonance.
This observation indicates that, for the 3.3 eV shape
resonance , the formation of the HCOO−ion is not
possible when the dissociation occurs near the keto side,
producing molecular H 2as a by-product. Both channels
(6a and 6b) are relevant only to the 6-12 eV Feshbach
resonance .
2. C−O dissociation near the ethyl site
In this dissociation channel, water (H 2O) forms as a
by-product. This dissociation involves a concerted three-9
body process through structural rearrangements in the
TNI. In this process, two C −H bonds dissociate from
the CH 3COO site, one C −O bond dissociates, and two
O−H bonds form, resulting in the production of H 2O
(Channel 6c). The formation of HCCO−from the ac-
etate (CH 3COO) site has been observed in previous stud-
ies [28, 29]. In a recent report on DEA to acetic acid,
Chakraborty et al. [29] identified a strong signal for the
HCCO−ions around 2 eV and 10 eV regions, which ex-
actly matches the structure of HCCO−ions observed in
the present study. The authors attribute the formation of
HCCO−to structural rearrangements in the acetic acid
TNI, where H 2O is formed as a by-product. By compar-
ing with the previous report, we assign Channel (6c) as
the most probable fragmentation channel for the HCCO−
formation. We discard the sequential dissociation process
through the formation of the CH 3COO−due to its ex-
tremely stable configuration. The computed threshold
energy for this channel is 2.73 eV.
(CH 3COOC 2H5)∗−→HCCO−+ H 2O + C 2H5(6c)
This observation indicates that, for the 3.3 eV shape res-
onance , this is the sole dissociation channel capable of
producing HCCO−. This dissociation is also highly prob-
able for the 6-12 eV resonance as well.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The investigation of DEA to ethyl acetate within
the 1 to 13 eV energy range using a QMS revealed ashape resonance around 3 eV, accompanied by multiple
core-excited Feshbach resonances in the 5 to 12 eV en-
ergy region. Fragment anions with six different masses
were observed, and the production of [(M −H)−], CH−
3,
CH 3CO−, C2H5O−and CH 3COO−ions was justified by
single bond breakage. However, the formation of HCCO−
involved a complex dissociation mechanism. Our exper-
imental findings, combined with theoretical calculations,
provide insight into the potential dissociation mecha-
nisms leading to HCCO−formation. It is suggested that
three-body or higher-order dissociations may be involved
in all these dissociation channels.
