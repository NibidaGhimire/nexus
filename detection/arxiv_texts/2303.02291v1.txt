Abstract —Soft robotic snakes made of compliant materials
can continuously deform their bodies and, therefore, mimic the
biological snakes’ ﬂexible and agile locomotion gaits better than
their rigid-bodied counterparts. Without wheel support, to date,
soft robotic snakes are limited to emulating planar locomotion
gaits, which are derived via kinematic modeling and tested on
robotic prototypes. Given that the snake locomotion results from
the reaction forces due to the distributed contact between their
skin and the ground, it is essential to investigate the locomotion
gaits through efﬁcient dynamic models capable of accommodat-
ing distributed contact forces. We present a complete spatial
dynamic model that utilizes a ﬂoating-base kinematic model with
distributed contact dynamics for a pneumatically powered soft
robotic snake. We numerically evaluate the feasibility of the
planar and spatial rolling gaits utilizing the proposed model
and experimentally validate the corresponding locomotion gait
trajectories on a soft robotic snake prototype. We qualitatively
and quantitatively compare the numerical and experimental
results which conﬁrm the validity of the proposed dynamic model.
I. I NTRODUCTION
Snakes’ unique physical structure with spatial bending
capabilities enables them to overcome numerous challenges
in their habitats. They frequently use lateral undulation,
sidewinding, rectilinear, and concertina locomotion gaits to
navigate terrains. Additionally, snakes use rolling gaits for
multiple purposes such as climbing trees efﬁciently, moving
their bodies sideways quickly on uneven terrains and slopes,
crossing over obstacles, handling prey, ﬁghting, etc. Over
the years, roboticists have developed various robotic snake
prototypes to harness these unique characteristics [1]. Com-
pared to traditional rigid-bodied robotic snakes, the continuous
bending capability of soft robotic snakes (SRSs) increases their
adaptability and ﬂexibility with the environment.
Snake locomotion results from differential friction reaction
forces between the skin and the contact surface (friction
anisotropy) [2]. Therefore, to accurately emulate snake loco-

motion, it is essential to study their locomotion gaits through
dynamic models that include anisotropic frictional forces.
Existing snake robots lack dynamic models that can accurately
and efﬁciently mimic seamless snake locomotion.
Generating dynamic models for continuum robots is difﬁcult
due to the signiﬁcant deformation they undergo [3]–[6]. Re-
searchers have proposed several dynamic modeling techniques
for continuum robots over the years [7]. Lumped parameter
models such as those reported in [8] used piecewise-constant
curvature approximation of robot shape. Those models did not
account for axial deformation and become invalid when the
robot is subjected to complex external loading. The discrete
Cosserat approach [9] and ﬁnite element methods [10] have
also been used to derive the dynamics of multisection con-
tinuum robots. Their use is limited in real-time applications
since they involve computationally expensive calculations.
To date, many dynamic models for rigid robotic snakes
have been proposed [11]. The rigid robotic snakes made of
discrete rigid units inherently lack continuous skin, hence their
dynamic models do not reﬂect organic snake locomotion.
Prior work on dynamic modeling of SRSs includes [12]–
[14]. Their work is limited to wheeled SRSs and present planar
locomotion dynamics of segmented SRSs. Compared to [12],
dynamic models in [13] and [14] incorporated anisotropic
friction forces acting on SRS wheels and described planararXiv:2303.02291v1  [cs.RO]  4 Mar 2023A

locomotion. But, wheeled SRS dynamic models offer limited
utility when imitating spatial SRS locomotion gaits with
distributed skin-ground contact forces. However, no spatial
dynamic models for SRS that support distributed contact
models exist.
In our previous work [15], we proposed a pneumatic muscle
actuator (PMA) powered SRS. We showed the utility of
spatial bending to derive SRS locomotion gaits without wheels
through planar rolling. Therein, the jointspace trajectories
(length variation of PMAs) for rolling locomotion derived via
the complete kinematic model were directly tested on the SRS
prototype on a trial-and-error basis. In this work, we extend
the proposed planar rolling approach to validate spatial rolling
gaits on SRSs. Hence, a spatial dynamic model of the SRS is
beneﬁcial to validate the gait performance.
Godage et al. in [16]–[18] proposed dynamic modeling
for variable-length continuum arms based on an integral
Lagrangian approach. In [18], they proposed a new spa-
tial dynamic model for multi-section continuum arms and
validated using a pneumatically actuated prototype. Yet, it
did not include contact modeling. In this work, we modify
the dynamic model in [18] by adding contact dynamics to
accommodate SRS locomotion. Extending [18], in this work,
we, i) present a complete spatial dynamic model with contact
dynamics for SRSs, ii) evaluate the model in a simulation
environment, and iii) validate the model on an SRS prototype
for planar and spatial rolling gaits.
II. K INEMATIC MODELING
A. Prototype Description
The SRS prototype shown in Fig. 1 is assembled using three
serially attached soft bending units (i.e. sections) shown in
Fig. 2A. An SRS section is actuated by three McKibben-type
extension-mode PMAs [19], [20]. PMAs are fabricated using
commercially available Silicone tubes, pneumatic union con-
nectors, Nylon braided sleeves, and high strength Polyethylene
fasteners (Figs. 2B and 2C) [21]. Within bending sections,
PMAs are mounted tri-symmetrically at a
3angle from each
other and 0:0125mradius from its centerline using 3D-printed
mounting frames at either end (Fig. 2D). A PMA axially
extends upon pressurizing and can sustain pressures up to
4bars . The unactuated length of a PMA is 0:15mand can

extend 50% at 4bars . The 0:0025mthick, laser-cut Delrin
constrainer plates (Fig. 2E) help maintain PMA clearance to
the central axis of a section as well as adjacent PMAs during
operation without torsion and buckling. Further, hollowed
symmetrical design of bending sections facilitates the routing
of pneumatic supply lines within the robot structure. When
pressurized, the pressure difference of PMAs generates a
torque imbalance at the mounting end plates (Fig. 2D). Based
on the induced pressure differential, this torque facilitates the
omnidirectional bending deformation of SRS bending units.
We assemble the SRS by serially connecting the bending
sections via mounting frames with a
3angular offset (enlarged
image in Fig. 2A). This angular offset allows the pneumatic
tube routing without impeding the functionality of adjacent
bending sections. We use a uniform rubber skin (Fig. 2A) to
wrap the outer surface of the SRS to form a continuous skin-
like layer for achieving uniform friction during operation. The
unactuated SRS prototype is 0:60min length and weighs
0:35kg. As there are 9, independently controlled PMAs, the
SRS has 9 actuated degrees of freedom (DoF).
B. Robot Kinematic Model
In our previous work [15], we derived the model kinematics
of the 3-section SRS along its neutral axis. In this work,
we extend its results to kinematically represent the SRS skin
(i.e., robot boundaries where we implement contact points).
We parameterize the SRS skin at a radius, rifrom the SRS
neutral axis with an angular offset i2[0;2]as shown in
Fig. 3B. Considering any ithsection (i2f1;2;3g) of the SRS

C. Review of Trajectory Generation
The SRS kinematic model is given in Sec. II-B is used to
derive the following locomotion trajectories. We consider two
trajectories. First is planar rolling where SRS sections share
their bending on the same plane. The second is spatial rolling.
In this work, we extend the planar rolling reported in [15] to

introduce this new locomotion gait where each SRS section
bends on separate bending planes (relative to fObg) creating
a spatial bending pattern similar to a helix. It is achieved by
applying the jointspace trajectories computed for the planar
rolling and actuating the adjacent SRS bending sections with
an added constant angular phase shift, '=

visualize these rolling patterns relative to SRS origin. The
trajectory generation procedure includes the following steps;
i) identifying desired locomotion gait trajectory with respect
to the global coordinate frame, ii) discretizing a gait trajectory
cycle, iii) projecting the gait curve at discretized locations
to the robot coordinate system, and ﬁnally, iv) employing
an optimization-based inverse kinematic approach to obtain
a joint space trajectory. Readers are referred to our previous
work [15] for more details pertaining to these steps.
Following the same steps, derived trajectory curves of planar
and spatial rolling gaits relative to the robot coordinate frame
are shown in Figs. 5A and 5B, respectively. Therein, thin red
lines show projected trajectory curves onto the robot origin
and thick multi-color lines show matched SRS shapes (Refer
to Sec III in [15] for more details). Correspondingly, obtained
jointspace trajectories for planar and spatial rolling gaits for a
period of 4sare shown in Figs. 5C and 5D, respectively. They
are applied to validate the dynamic model in Sec. IV. Note
that, in planar rolling, all sections operate without a phase
shift ('= 0). Hence, joint variables in each section overlap
each other as visualized in Fig. 5C. On the other hand, joint
variables in spatial rolling operate with a phase shift ( '=

as visualized in Fig. 5D.
III. D YNAMIC MODELING
The SRS dynamic modeling includes two components;
robot-ground contact dynamics which includes the distributed
contact dynamics along the robot snakeskin and complete SRS
dynamics which presents the equations of motion (EoM) of the
SRS.
A. Robot-Ground Contact Dynamics
We extend the dynamic model derived for variable–length
multisection continuum robotic manipulators reported in [18]
to model the SRS considered here. However, the dynamic
model cannot be directly utilized for modeling the SRS.
Because, therein, the continuum manipulator has a ﬁxed base
whereas SRS achieves locomotion via different gaits. In addi-
tion, the model does not handle external forces. But, similar to
snakes, the SRS achieves locomotion when its skin-like outer
layer makes distributed contact with a surface and generates
reaction forces via friction.
Hence, we modify the model reported in [18] to includePressure SourceSnake RobotPressure CommandsDAQ

a ﬂoating coordinate frame to support locomotion modeling
and distributed contact dynamics and use it as a snake.
The utility of moving coordinate systems on soft locomoting
robots has been explored in [22], [23]. However, implementing
continuous contact dynamics is computationally inefﬁcient.
We use a discrete model with an array of ﬁnely distributed
contact points deﬁned along the periphery of the SRS by
introducing two parameters, 2[0;3]andi2[0;2]which
discretize the SRS surface into 31 points axially and 10 points
radially as shown in (1) and (2). This results in 310 contact
points on the outer layer of the SRS. We compute the reaction
forces of those points when contact conditions are met using
a spring-damper ground model (Fig. 6). We deﬁne a ground
contact condition as when the z coordinate of a contact point
with respect tofOgis negative, i.e., z < 0, [24]. As long
as this condition is met, the reaction forces are continuously
computed and added to the SRS dynamic model as follows.
Without losing generality, let the zcomponent of the ground
reaction force at any contact point (deﬁned by jandk), be

Here, we assume that the ground stiffness is sufﬁciently
large (i.e., high Kg) and thuszis negligible such that our
point-contact model is valid. To achieve locomotion, there
must be net reaction forces on the X Yplane (Fig. 6).

B. Complete Soft Robotic Snake Dynamics
We assume that an SRS section is made of a set of
inﬁnitesimally thin slices with constant mass and uniform
linear density. Using the ﬂoating base kinematics derived
in (2), we calculate the kinetic and potential energies of a
thin slice and integrate them to ﬁnd the total energies of
bending sections. We then apply the Lagrangian mechanics-
based recursive computation scheme proposed in [18] to derive
the EoM of the SRS as

IV. D YNAMIC MODEL VALIDATION
We carry out the dynamic model validation in three steps. In
the ﬁrst step, we implement the dynamic model as a numerical
model and apply locomotion trajectories derived in Sec. II-C
and simulate them in a contact-enabled simulation environ-
ment. The second step involes the application of the same
locomotion trajectories tested in the ﬁrst step to the actual SRS
hardware and experimentally evaluated for gait replications.
In the last step, we qualitatively and quantitatively compare
the numerical model outputs with experimental results and
validate the dynamic model.
A. Dynamic Model Simulation
We implemented the SRS dynamic model derived in
Sec. III-B as a numerical model and provided jointspace
trajectories (Figs. 5C and 5D) as inputs to test for gait
simulations. The numerical model was implemented in the
MATLAB 2021a programming environment, and simulations
were recorded. MATLAB’s ODE15 solver is selected for
solving the (5) due to the stiff nature of the complex, high-
DoF dynamic systems such as the one presented here. Herein,
jointspace trajectories (i.e., length changes) are converted into
pressure trajectories and then applied as force inputs ( =
pressuresectional area of PMAs ) (see Sec. IV-D). We
approximated PMA elastic stiffness limiting values as Ki1=
1900Nm 18i2f1;2;3g(rounded to the nearest 100) andthe damping coefﬁcients as Di1= 90Nm 1s8i2f1;2;3g
(rounded to the nearest 10) following an experimental proce-
dure similar to the one proposed in [18]. We assumed that the
robot is actuating on a carpeted ﬂoor (Fig. 1) that has uniform
friction. We experimentally approximated the ground stiffness
asKg= 1000Nm 1, damping as Bg= 130Nm 1sand,
static frictional coefﬁcients as x= 0:6; y= 0:2. The
gravitational acceleration was set as 9:81ms 2.
B. Experimental Setup
The experimental setup prepared for the SRS testing is
shown in Fig. 7. We use a constant pressure source (a compres-
sor with 8bar) to supply air pressure to digital proportional
pressure regulators (SMC ITV3050) and then regulate pressure
to individual PMAs of the SRS – nine regulators are used for
nine PMAs in three robot bending sections. Each regulator
is independently controlled by a 0 10Vanalog input
voltage signal provided through a data acquisition (DAQ) card
(National Instruments PCI-6221). The DAQ card is installed
in a host computer, and control signals are generated using a
MATLAB Simulink Desktop Real-Time model.
C. Numerical Testing
In the simulation, ﬁrst, we dropped the robot from a
known height ( 0:6m) and then engaged the SRS in rolling
trajectories. The dropping test was carried out to evaluate the
contact dynamic model as explained in the subsequent text.

ﬂoating-base parameter changes) during a simulation period of
15swith respect to spatial rolling. The joint variable output
(lij) is presented in Fig. 8C. It closely resembles the trajectory
input shown in Fig. 5D. Initial drop ( 0 2sin Fig. 8A)
helps us examine the validity of the contact dynamic model
stated in Sec. III-A as follows. After the drop, it is clear
thatzstops atz= 0, assuring ground contact conditions.
Additionally, Fig. 8A proves that, throughout the simulation,
the robot stays above the ground. We recorded simulation data
at30Hzsampling rate to ensure a smooth approximation of
jointspace variable changes in simulation videos. Two separate

presented in Fig. 9. Readers are referred to the accompanying
multimedia ﬁle (https://youtu.be/V_RNFEiVXlw) to see the
complete simulations. The simulation outputs show that the
dynamic model replicates the desired gaits well, demonstrating
the intended operation of ground contact dynamics.
D. Prototype Testing
The locomotion gaits are tested on the SRS prototype
to compare and validate the results obtained in numerical
testing. We tested the SRS prototype for planar and spatial
rolling gaits on a carpeted ﬂoor with uniform friction. The
jointspace trajectories are length changes of PMAs, and they
must be actuated in order to obtain locomotion from the SRS
prototype. The length changes of PMAs are a function of input
pressures. Therefore, we adopted the approach used in [15] to
establish the length-to-pressure mapping and supply pressure
inputs accordingly. We applied the same jointspace trajectories
used in dynamic model simulations (i.e., length parameters in
Figs. 5C and 5D) to obtain pressure trajectories and actuate
the SRS prototype. The locomotion trajectories were tested for
15sat a maximum supply pressure of 3barand frequency
0:50Hz, which are consistent with the simulation inputs. A
3barpressure ceiling was used based on PMAs’ ability to
achieve the required SRS deformation. The frequency range
was chosen based on the operational bandwidth of PMAs to
obtain meaningful locomotion. The SRS testing was videocaptured using a ﬁxed camera station. The locomotion pro-
gression of the SRS during planar and spatial rolling gaits is
shown in Figs. 10A and 10B respectively. Our multimedia ﬁle
(https://youtu.be/V_RNFEiVXlw) shows the complete results
of these experiments. The results show that similar to the
numerical testing, the SRS prototype replicated the desired
locomotion trajectories well on the carpeted ﬂoor.
E. Discussion
The Figs. 11A and 11B show respective contact point map-
ping between dynamic model simulations and SRS prototype
testing. Similar to the dynamic model simulations, we ob-
served that the SRS prototype could successfully replicate two
rolling gaits. Note that, here we applied the same jointspace
trajectories (in Figs. 5C and 5D) to the numerical model
and the SRS prototype. Hence, the replication of closely
resembled locomotion patterns with contact points in both
models qualitatively conﬁrms the validity of the proposed
dynamic model.
We tracked numerical and experimental model outputs to
quantify and compare the dynamic model performance. Refer
to Figs. 12A and 12B show the captured X Ydisplacement
of the SRS during planar and spatial rolling gait replications.
The left in each ﬁgure shows the X Ydisplacement of
the numerical model. The experimental displacement data
shown on the right were captured using the image perspective
projection method reported in [15]. Based on displacement
data, the calculated linear velocity components are presented
in Table I. Results in Table I show that the velocity components
of the SRS numerical model closely follow (Error, < 09 %)
its counterpart, i.e., the SRS prototype, thereby quantitatively
verifying the proposed dynamic model.

V. C ONCLUSIONS
The SRSs lack spatial dynamic models that support dis-
tributed contact dynamics. We proposed a dynamic model
with simpliﬁed point-based contact dynamics for a 3-section
SRS in this work. The proposed dynamic model is capable of
replicating spatial locomotion gaits. We presented a kinematic
model of the SRS and used it to obtain jointspace trajectories
for two types of locomotion gaits known as planar and spatial
rolling. First, we implemented the SRS dynamic model as
a numerical model and applied jointspace trajectories in a
simulation environment. Next, we applied the same jointspace
trajectories to the SRS prototype and experimentally tested
the SRS’s ability to replicate the intended two gaits. The SRS
dynamic model and the prototype replicated gaits well. Both
tests gave qualitatively and quantitatively consistent results,
thus validating the proposed dynamic model. We intend to ex-
tend the dynamic model validation into other snake locomotion
gaits in our future work.
