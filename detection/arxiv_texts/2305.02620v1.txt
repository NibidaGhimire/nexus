ABSTRACT  
One of the great challenges facing atomically dispersed catalysts, including single -atom catalyst  
(SAC) and double -atom catalyst (DAC) is their ultra -low metal loading ( typically less than 5 
wt%), basically limiting  the practical catalytic application , such as oxygen  reduction  reaction  
(ORR) crucial to hydrogen fuel cell and metal -air battery. Although some important progresses 
have been achieved on ultra -high-density ( UHD) SACs, the reports on UHD-DACs with stable 
uniform dispersion is still lack ing. Herein, based on  the experimentally synthesized M 2N6 motif  
(M = Sc-Zn) , we theoretically demonstrate d the existence of  the UHD-DACs with the metal 
loading >  40 wt%, which were confirmed by systematic analysi s of dynamic , thermal, 
mechanical, thermodynamic, and electrochemical stabilities . Furthermore, ORR activities of 
the UHD-DACs are comparable with or even better than th ose of the experimentally 
synthesized low-density  (LD)  counterparts, and the Fe 2N6 and Co 2N6 UHD-DACs locate at the 
peak of the activity volcano with  ultra-low overpotentials of 0.31 and 0.33 V , respectively . 
Finally, spin magnetic moment of active center  is found to be a catalytic descriptor  for ORR on 
the DACs.  Our work will stimulate the exper imental exploration of the ultra -high-density  
DACs and provides the novel insight into the relationship between ORR activity of the DACs 
and their spin states.

 Ⅰ. INTRODUCTION  
The four-electron  oxygen reduction reaction (ORR ) is a key electrochemical reaction for 
the renewable  energy conversion and storage technologies , due to its significance for  metal -air 
batteries and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) . [1–3] Up to now, P t-based 
catalysts are the best -known ORR electrocatalysts for commercial applications.  [4–6] However, 
the large -scale commercialization  of Pt-based catalysts is significantly restricted by the  low 
natural reserves, high cost, and limited stability  of Pt . Therefore, designing and searching 
alternative ORR electro catalysts of low cost, high activity, and long durability is increasingly 
attractive but with great challenges ahead.  [7,8]  For example, single -atom catalyst (SAC) with 
uniform dispersion of  transition -metal (TM) active sites coordinated with nitrogen atoms in 
carbon (termed as M -N-C, such as FeN 4 SAC  [9,10] ) have  gained wide attentions in the past 
few years.  [11–14] 
Very r ecently, double -atom catalyst  (DAC)  has emerged as a new frontier in  heterogenous 
electrocataly sis due to its  synergetic dual atomic sites , which can endow DAC with  many  
intrinsic advantages compared with SAC for the multiple -step  coupled  electron -proton transfer 
reactions in electrocatalysis.  [15–17] To be specific, for ORR, the dual atomic sites  can 
facilitate the dissociation of the O -O bond of the intermediates tending to adopt the side -on 
adsorption configuration , which favors the desirable four -electron ORR and hinders the two -
electron ORR, thereby promoting the energy efficiency of the ORR process  in PEMFCs or 
metal -air batteries and enhancing the stability of catalysts . [18–23,23 –30] Among the various 
DAC s for ORR, the one with each TM metal  coordinated with four  N atoms in carbon sheet 
(termed as M 2N6 DAC  as shown in Fig . S1(a) within the Supplemental Material [31]) has 
gained particular at tentions, [18,23 –29,32,33]  for which the basic structural motif , M 2N6, is 
shown in Fig . 1(a). Combining experimental and theoretical simulations, the FeMnN 6, FeCoN 6, 
FeNiN 6, and FeZnN 6 DACs for ORR ha ve been thoroughly investigated, and these systems 
outperform the corresponding SAC counterparts and even the Pt/C catalysts.  [23–26,28,29]  For 
example, electronic  synergies between Fe and Mn in FeMnN 6 deliver  the better durability and 
more excellent ORR performance (half -wave potential s are 0.928 and 0.804 V in alkaline 
condition and  acidic media , respectively ) than both FeN 4, MnN 4 SAC s, and commercial Pt/C  
catalyst . [24] In addition,  besides ORR, M 2N6 DACs have been also theoretically and 
experimentally demonstrated to be efficient  for the electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction and other 
reactions.  [34–39]  
On the other hand, o ne of the most significant challenges f acing the atomically dispersed 
catalysts is their ultra -low active site density (typically less than 5 wt%),  [23–25,27,34,39– 43] 
which leads to  their overall  poor catalytic performance and limits the future industrialization. 
For example, for  MnFeN 6 DAC mentioned above , the content of Fe and Mn are only 2.3 wt% 
and 1.6 wt%, respectively.  [24] Excitingly, very recently, there already are some breakt hroughs in synthesizing ultra -high-density (UHD) SAC s. [44–48] A multilayer stabilization strategy 
was used to construct SACs with metal loading to 16 wt%.  [49] A versatile approach combining 
impregnation and two-step annealing can successfully synthesize 15 metals on chemically 
distinct supports with metal contents up to 23 wt%.  [50] The meal loading of SAC can even 
reach up to about 40 wt% by means of a graphene quantum dot assisted synthesis strategy . [51] 
However, with  advantages of DAC compared with SAC in mind, to our  best knowledge, there 
are no UHD- DAC s reported up to now , which is the focus of the present study.  
Herein, starting from  the M 2N6 motif shown in Fig . 1(a), we tried to construct the UHD-
DACs ( Fig. 1(a)) with as few C atoms as possible as glue, which can reach the metal loading > 
40 wt% in weight fraction, corresponding to the 14 at% in atomic metal percentage . For the 
active center, all the 3 d TMs  (Sc~Zn) with small atomic radius have been considered, inspired 
by the experimental reports.  [24,26,34,35]  Among various  UHD- DAC candidates, t en ones 
were screened out , which exhibit  excellent dynamic, thermal, mechanical, thermodynamic, and 
electrochemical stabilities , comparable to the corresponding low -density (LD) systems (see the 
atomic models in Fig . S1(b)). Furthermore, the ORR reaction mechanism has been comparably 
investigated for the UHD- DACs and their corresponding LD-DACs (Fig. S1(b)). Finally, the 
relationship between the ORR catalytic activity of the considered DACs and their spin magnetic 
moment was investigated  and uncovered.   
Ⅱ. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS  
All spin -polarized computations were carried out by the generalized gradient 
approximation (GGA) method with Perdewe– Burke –Ernzerhof (PBE) functional  [52] based on 
density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Vienna ab initio  Simulation Package 
(V ASP),  [53,54]  in which van der Waals (vdW) correction proposed by Grimme (DFT +D3) 
was chosen.  [55] The plane-wave basis set with a cut -off energy of 500 eV were employed. A 
vacuum layer of ~1 6 Å was used to avoid the interactions between periodic images for all 
calculations. The convergence thresholds of the total energy and the Hellmann –Feynman force 
are 10-7 eV and 0.0005 eV/Å, respectively. For the structural optimization of primitive  cell, 
various  magnetic states have been considered and relaxed by the Monkhorst –Pack meshes of 8 
× 8 × 1 and the optimized lattice parameters of the lowest -energy structures are presented in 
Table S1 , with the corresponding atomic configurations in Fig . S1(c). The phonon dispersions 
were calculated with the finite displacement method by using the PHONOPY code.  [56] The 
ab initio  molecular dynamics (AIMD)  simulations for the new UHD-DAC supercells (2 × 2 × 
1) were performed based on the NVT ensemble with a time step of 2 fs and total time of 10 ps.  
The simulated scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images were obtained using the Tersoff –
Hamann theory.  [57] 
For the binding energy ( Eb), dissolution potential ( Udiss, versus SHE), and formation 
energy ( Eform) of UHD-DACs and corresponding LD -DACs, they can be defined as:  Eb = E (total) – E (CN) – µ (M 1) − µ (M 2)                                                (1)  
Udiss = Udiss° (metal, bulk) –  Eb/(eN e*NM)                                                 (2)  
Eform = E (total) – 6µ (N) – 6µ (C) – µ (M 1) − µ (M 2)                                             (3)  
where E (total) and E  (CN) are the total energies of DAC system and CN composite, 
respectively; µ (M 1), µ (M 2), µ (N), and µ (C) are the chemical potential of the involved species, 
which is taken from the metal bulk, N 2 molecules, and graphene, respectively; Udiss° (metal, 
bulk) and N e are the standard dissolution potential (pH = 0) of bulk metal in aqueous solution 
and the number of electrons involved in the dissolution, respectively, which are taken from the 
previous work  [58,59]  and has been listed in Table S4 . NM indicates the number of metal a toms. 
The NM takes 2 for the current DAC system . [60]  
The in -plane Young’s modulus ( Ex, Ey), Poisson’s ratio ( νxy, νyx), and shear modulus ( G) 
along the armchair ( x) and zigzag ( y) directions for UHD-DACs can be calculated by the 
following equations:  [61]  
Ex = (C11C22-C12C21)/C22                                                         (4)  
Ey = (C11C22-C12C21)/C11                                                         (5)  
νxy = C21/C22                                                                            (6) 
νyx = C12/C11                                                                            (7) 
G = C66                                                                                   (8) 
For the ORR related calculations, the standard conventional cells of various UHD-DACs 
were used as the electrocatalysts and the Monkhorst –Pack meshes of  5 × 4 × 1 and 12 × 10 × 1 
are adopted for structural optimization and calculation of densities of states (DOS), respectively. 
The convergence thresholds of the total energy and the Hellmann– Feynman force are 10-5 eV 
and 0.0 3 eV/Å, respectively.  
The free energy change ( ∆G) under the acidic medium (pH = 0) for each elementary 
reaction step was calculated based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model,  [62–
64] according to the following equation:  
∆G = ∆E + ∆EZPE – T∆S                                                           (9)  
where ∆ E is the reaction energy from DFT calculations. ∆E ZPE and T∆S (T = 298.15 K) are the 
contributions of the zero-point energy and entropy to ∆G, respectively. E ZPE and TS for the free 
molecules are taken from the NIST database,  [65] and those of the adsorbed species were 
obtained based on the calculated vibrational frequencies and then with the V ASPKIT code.  [66] 
The reaction step with ∆G max is the potential-determining step (PDS). 
The ORR has been investigated under the acidic medium (pH = 0) , the corresponding 
elementary reaction steps along the pathway-A, pathway -B, and pathway -C for ORR in Fig. 3a 
can be described as:  
* + O 2 + H+ + e– → *OOH                                                   (10 A)  * + O 2 + H+ + e– → *O*OH                                         (10B; 10C) 
*OOH + H+ + e– → *O + H 2O                                              (11A)  
*O*OH + H+ + e– → *O + H 2O                                            (11B) 
*O*OH + H+ + e– → *OH*OH                                             (1 1C) 
                                   *O + H+ + e– → *O H                                                   (12A ; 12B)  
*OH*OH + H+ + e– → *O H + H 2O                                      (12 C) 
*OH + H+ + e– → * + H 2O                                  (1 3A; 13B; 13C) 
The Gibbs adsorption free energy  of the intermediates (*OH, *OOH (*O*OH), *OH*OH, 
and *O)  can be evaluated by the following equations:  
ΔG (*OH) = G (*OH) + 1/2 G (H2) – G* – G (H2O)                          (14) 
ΔG (*OOH ) = G (*OOH) + 3/2 G (H2) – G* – 2G (H2O)                   (15)  
ΔG (*O*O H) = G (*O*OH) + 3/2 G (H2) – G* – 2G (H2O)               (16)  
ΔG (*OH*OH) = G (*OH*OH) + G  (H2) – G * – 2G (H2O)              (17)  
ΔG (*O) =  G (*O) + G  (H2) – G * – * G (H2O)                                  (18) 
According to the above Δ G values, and setting Δ G (O2) = 4.92 eV and Δ G (H2O) = 0 eV, 
respectively, we can obtain the free energy changes ( ΔGx, for step x  = 1−4) and equilibrium 
potential ( Ux, x = 1−4) as follows:  
ΔG1 = –eU1 = ΔG (*OOH ) – 4.92                                                    (1 9A) 
 ΔG1 = –eU1 = ΔG (*O*O H) – 4.92                                          (1 9B; 19C) 
ΔG2 = –eU2 = ΔG (*O) – ΔG (*OOH )                                              ( 20A)  
ΔG2 = –eU2 = ΔG (*O) – ΔG (*O*O H)                                            ( 20B) 
    ΔG2 = –eU2 = ΔG (*OH*OH ) – ΔG (*O*O H)                                 (20C)  
ΔG3 = –eU3 = ΔG (*OH) – ΔG (*O)                                        (21A ; 21B) 
ΔG3 = –eU3 = ΔG (*OH) – ΔG (*OH*OH)                                      ( 21C) 
ΔG4 = –eU4 = – ΔG (*OH)                                              (22A ; 22B;  22C) 
where A, B and C indicate the pathway -A, pathway -B, and pathway-C for ORR in Fig . 3a, 
respectively. Then the overpotential ( ηORR, V) is defined in the following:  
ηORR = (ΔGmax/e) + 1.23                                                         (23 ) 
The standar d GGA simulations  usually underestimates the solvation effect to affect the 
free energies for ORR under the practical conditions.  The continuum solvation model  [67] were 
used to investigate t he solvation effect on the ORR. The solvation energies for different 
adsorbed species are shown in the Table S6 . These values from continuum solvation model are 
all negative, indicating that the solvent can stabilize the adsorbates in solution. Also, it is noted 
that our calculation values are comparable to the previous works.  [18,59,68]  We also studi ed 
the solvation effect for ORR from the explicit water  by combining force -field molecular 
dynamic simulation implemented in LAMMPS, [69,70]  ab initio  molecular dynamics simulation in V ASPsol, [67] and static  structural optimization . It is found that the solvation  
energies from the continuum solvation model by V ASPsol are comparable with those from our 
explicit model and those of previous work.  [18,68,71]  Moreover, the explicit solvation effect 
doesn’t alter their optimal reaction pathway for ORR on both UHD - and LD -DACs [see Note 
S1 with corresponding figure s and table s in Supplemental Material  [31]].  
Ⅲ. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
A. Morphologies of UHD- DACs  
Stimulated by the experimental LD-DAC  (Fig. S1(a) ), we have designed a new kind of 
2D material ( i.e., the UHD-DAC herein in Fig. 1(a) ) by extremely reducing the surrounding 
carbon atoms of dual metal active center. From Fig. 1(a) , the lattice structure of M 2N6 UHD -
DACs was constructed by gluing the M 2N6 motif by six C atom locating at the corner of 
primitive cell, which  realize a minimu m cell containing a pair of TM atoms (TM = Sc~Zn). 
Thus , the geometric structure of active center for the designed UHD-DAC s is the same as that 
of experimentally prepared  LD-DAC, but the former achiev es a unprecedently ultra -high 
density of active center with  metal loading up to 36 to 46 wt% for DACs  in weight fraction , 
which catch up with the  recently reported ultra-high- density Ir-N-C SAC ( ~ 40 wt%). [51] From 
the view of atomic metal percentage,  [72] here the UHD-DACs present the high metal contents 
of 14 .3 at%, about 4 times larger than that of the Ir -N-C SAC (3.8 at%).  [51] For the structural  
optimization, the optimized lattice parameters of the lowest -energy structures are presented in 
Table S1 , with the corresponding atomic configurations in Fig . S1(c). For all the cases, the 
systems have  the 2D rhombus  lattice  of primitive cell, while they own the 2D rectangular  
conventional cell , dissimilar to the well-known lattice symmetry of graphene . The homonuclear  
(heteronuclear ) UHD- DAC structures possess the space group of Cmmm (Amm2) with the point 
group D 2h (C2v) symmetry, which both belong to the orthorhombic phase.  As a contrast, the 
theoretical model of experimentally synthesized LD- DACs was also built by embedding the 
same M 2N6 active center in 3  × 6 rectangular supercells ( Fig. S1(b) ) for simulations .  
B. Dynamic, thermal, mechanical, thermodynamic, and electrochemical stabilities  of 
UHD -DACs  
We comprehensively examined their stabilities from five aspects:  dynamic, thermal, 
mechanical, thermodynamic, and electrochemical stabilities ( Fig. 1(b)). The constructed UHD-
DAC would be considered stable if it meet s all the stability criteria  (Fig. S2 ). First, the dynamic 
stability of the homonuclear M 2N6 UHD -DACs was verif ied by calculating their phonon 
dispersions, which describes the dispersion relations of lattice vibrations and usually identif ies 
as the decisive factor for materials’ stability. From Fig . 2(a) and Fig. S3, we can find that only 
homonuclear Mn 2N6, Fe 2N6, Co 2N6, and Ni2N6 UHD- DACs  are dynamically stable as indicated 
by the absence of the obvious imaginary phonon frequencies. Small atomic radii of Mn, Fe, Co, 
and Ni correspond to the relatively small lattice constant s and compact lattice interaction s [73] of UHD-DACs , which are response for the dynamic  stability of homonuclear Mn 2N6, Fe 2N6, 
Co2N6, and Ni2N6 UHD-DACs.  Based on this result, it is expected that the heteronuclear UHD -
DACs formed by the pairwise combination of these four elements also  have the good dynamic 
stability. Thus, we also investigated the phonon dispersions  of six heteronuclear M 2N6 UHD-
DACs, i.e., MnFe N6, MnCo N6, MnNi N6, FeCo N6, FeNi N6, and CoNi N6 (Fig. S3). Like their 
corresponding homonuclear ones, they also possess the great dynamic stability  without any 
imaginary frequencies. It is noticed that all the UHD- DAC structures have 52 phonon 
vibrational modes, which are 3 acoustic modes and 49 optical modes. Through group theory 
analysis, the irreducible representation of the optical branches at the Brillouin -zone with Raman 
(R) and infrared (IR) symbols for the homonuclear  and heteronuclear  UHD- DAC structures are 
as follows: Γ optic (homonuclear ) = 7A g (R) + 2A u + 7B 1g (R) + 4B 1u (IR) + 3B 2g (R) + 6B 2u (IR) 
+ 4B 3g (R) + 6B 3u (IR); Γoptic (heteronuclear ) = 13A 1 (R/IR) + 6A 2 (R) + 7B 1 (R/IR) + 13B 2 
(R/IR). We hope here the Raman  and IR  Brillouin spectroscopy measurement s in the further 
experiments will test and verify the accuracy of the calculations in our theoretical  modeling.   
Furthermore, ab initio  Molecular Dynamics (AIMD)  simulations were performed to check 
the thermal stability under ambient conditions of these 10 M2N6 UHD- DACs with dynamic 
stability. Note that their total free energy only shows the  periodic oscillating near the 
equilibrium state during the entire simulation period of 10 ps at 500 K (Fig . 2(b) and Fig. S4). 
Simulation snapshots of the M 2N6 UHD -DACs also show their structural integrity at 10 ps,  
implying their thermal stability. In addition, w e calculated their elastic constants ( Table S3 ) of 
M2N6 UHD- DACs using the finite differences method [74] with assuming a thickness of 3.3 4 
Å on the basis of graphene’s thickness [75] to check their mechanical stability . Significantly, 
these values satisfy the requirements of the mechanical stability criterion  [76,77]  of a 2D 
material , i.e., C11 × C22 − C122 > 0 and C 66 > 0. The in -plane Young’s modulus  (Y, GPa) , 
Poisson’s ratio  (ν), and shear modulus (G, GPa ) were obtain ed from the elastic constants, which 
are summarized in Table S3 . Also, t he 2D directional projection in polar coordinates of the 
Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and shear modulus  of Fe2N6 UHD -DAC are displayed in Fig . 
2(c), and those for other systems are illustrated in Fig . S5. The mechanical results in Fig . 2(c), 
Fig. S5, and Table S3  show that the in -plane Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio along the 
armchair direction are larger than that along the zigzag direction , reveal ing the moderate  
anisotropy of the mechanical properties . Also, it is noted that the Young’s modulus  of all the 
UHD- DACs are much smaller than that of graphene (~1000 GPa),  [75,78]  indicating that the se 
UHD- DACs are softer than the well -known graphene and suitable for the strain -tunable  
catalysis.  [79] 
The thermodynamic stability  of ten UHD-D ACs was examined by the binding energy (Eb), 
as shown in Fig. 2(d) and Table S4 . The more  negative Eb values indicates the stronger 
chemical bond formed between the metal  atoms  and the  coordinate d N atoms. We can see that , the Eb values for all the ten UHD-D ACs are more negative than - 5 eV, which can effectively 
prevent the diffusion and aggregation of the metal atoms, promising high thermodynamic 
stability of the whole systems. For comparison, the Eb for the corresponding LD -DACs were 
also calculated , and the E b values of UHD-D ACs are only slightly positive than those of the 
corresponding LD -DACs, suggesting that the high density of metal loading will not affect the 
thermodynamic stability of current DAC systems.   
The electrochemical stability of electro catalyst is one of the  key factor s for its practical 
application in an electrochemical environment . [59] According to its definition  in the 
Computational Details , the more positive dissolution potential (Udiss) suggests that the metal 
dimer  strongly bind with the co ordinated atoms  in the UHD- DAC system and the dissolution 
of metal atoms can be avoided under the acidic conditions  (pH = 0) . To this end, we calculat ed 
the Udiss of above ten  UHD-D AC systems, as illustrated in Fig . 2(e) and Table S4 . Here we use 
the range of Udiss > 0 V to measure the electrochemical stability , which is a valid evaluation 
criterion that has been widely used in the literatures . [59,80]  Given  that all ten DAC  system s 
have the positive U diss values,  the metal dimers in the  corresponding UHD-D ACs (Mn 2N6, 
Fe2N6, Co 2N6, Ni 2N6, MnFe N6, MnCo N6, MnNi N6, FeCo N6, FeNi N6, and CoNi N6) with the 
dynamic , thermal, mechanical, and thermodynamic  stability can survive under the 
experimentally electrochemical conditions, suggesting their excellent electrochemical stability.  
C. Synthesis feasibility and electronic propertie s of UHD -DACs  
Then the feasibility of experimental realization of these ten  UHD -DACs is explored by 
calculating the formation energies (Eform) following in Computational Details . As shown in Fig . 
2(f) and Table S4 , their Eform values range from about 1.7  to 3.1 eV and are generally smaller 
than those  of another kinds of M 2N6 catalyst s with double MN 3 groups . [81,82]  We also 
observed  that the formation energies of Ni 2N6, FeNiN 6, and CoNiN 6 UHD- DACs are lower than 
or comparable with those of the corresponding synthesized ones  with low metal 
contents . [23,28,29,39,43]  Noted that the values of E form values depend on the chemical 
potentials of the involved species, which in turn depends on the experimental conditions. Therefore, it is the relative values of E
form that determine the formation probability of a specific 
system among various ones  and it is also expected that all the proposed UHD- DAC system s 
with dynamic, thermal, mechanical, thermodynamic, and electrochemical stabilities are 
suitably  synthesizable in the experiments.  Moreover, the calculated Eform values of UHD- DACs  
also indicate the thermodynamical stability of N -N motif and suppression of N 2 gas formation 
in the UHD-DACs because all these values are lower than that the experimentally synthesized 
Ni2N6 LD-DAC (3.22 eV) . [39] Hence, we also theoretically predicted the STM image s of these 
ten stable UHD-D ACs with 8 ×  8 supercells for the future experimental identification , as shown 
in Fig. 2(g) and Fig. S6. It is easy to recognize and correlate them with the corresponding 
atom ic structure of metal dimers,  while the C and N atoms are difficult to identify because they are lighter and then  brighter than the metal ones.  
We further investigated the electronic prope rties of the se ten stable UHD- DACs, including 
the electron localization function  (ELF)  and density of states  (DOS) . The bonding character s 
can be effectively characterized by  ELF. As shown in Fig. S7, the electrons are more localized 
around C and N atoms with larger ELF value s, while more delocalized around metal atoms with  
smaller  ELF value s, indicating  the strong covalent bonding characteristics  for C-C, C -N, N-N, 
and Fe -N interactions  and metallic bond ing feature s of metal  dimer s, which is responsible for  
the good stability of the UHD-DACs.  Importantly, the calculated total  DOS (TDOS) and partial 
DOS  (PDOS ) based on PBE and HSE06 functional  [83] presented in Fig . S8-9, suggest the 
metallic conductivity feature of all stable UHD-DACs , beneficial for the charge transfer during 
the electrocataly tic ORR process. Finally,  for most of the systems there are large spin magnetic 
moments localized on the anchored metal  atoms, which benefit the effective adsorption and 
activation of the oxygenated intermediates.  [84–86] However, the spin magnetic moments of 
the embedded Ni atoms are fully quenched  in the Ni 2N6 and CoNiN 6 UHD-DACs, probably 
due to the charge transfer and the electronic state coupling.  
D. Scaling relationship for adsorption of key intermediates  
Following the  comprehensive assessmen t of the overall stabilities and electronic prope rties 
of ten UHD -DACs, we investigated their ORR catalytic activity, as well as that of the 
corresponding LD -DACs.  Considering the dual metal sites of DACs, t hree reaction pathways 
for ORR have been considered under acidic conditions (pH = 0) . The traditional ORR pathway 
over the catalysts is shown in Fig . 3(a): the protonation of  *OOH to produce the first H 2O 
molecule and the  continuous hydrogenation of  the remaining *O atom  to yield the second H 2O 
molecule (pathway -A). Moreover , the dual -metal sites  may facilitate the breaking of  the O-O 
bond  of *OOH  as described in Fig . 3(a) to drive the ORR following the pathway -B or pathway -
C. [19,87]  All the three pathways have been  considered for ORR to obtain the most 
energetically  feasible ones.  
In fact, there are two mechanisms for the first electron transfer process of ORR . [88] One 
is that the process of short -range electron transfer to adsorbed O 2 occurs in the inner Helmholtz 
plane (ET -IHP mechanism), for which O 2 protonates in the catalyst surface to form the *OOH. 
Another is that the process of long -range electron transfer t o non -adsorbed O 2 occurs in the 
outer Helmholtz plane (ET -OHP mechanism), for which O 2 protonates in the electrolytes and 
subsequently adsorbs at active site as *OOH. However, the ET -IHP mechanism usually occurs 
on Pt based noble metal catalyst. For the SA Cs and DAC s, the ET -OHP mechanism is usually 
considered to be the relevant one.  [11,26]  Thus, we focused on the latter ET -OHP mechanism 
that does not rely on direct adsorption of O 2 to the catalyst surface and the initial stage for ORR 
is the gas phase O 2. 
Firstly , we investigated the adsorption of key intermediates, including *O, *OOH, *O*OH, *OH*OH, and *OH, and  the scaling relationship between their binding strengths (*O  and 
*OOH versus *OH (pathway -A); *O and *O*OH versus *OH  (pathway -B); *OH*OH and 
*O*OH versus *OH (pathway -C)). From  Fig. 3(b)-(d), we can see that  for UHD- DACs  
pathway -A exhibits  an excellent linear scaling relationship  between  the binding strengths of the  
oxygenated intermediates  with R2 = 0.99 and 0.98 for Δ G (*O) and Δ G (*OOH) versus Δ G 
(*OH), respectively . For pathway -B, the binding strength of *O and *OH is also well correlated 
with R2 = 0.98. However, the binding strengths between *O*OH or *OH*OH and *OH  for 
pathway -B and C display relatively poor linear relationship  (with R2 < 0.71), which could help  
to achieve better ORR activity due to the deviation of the linear scaling relationship. Moreover, 
this poor  scaling relation  can be ascribed to the different adsorption modes  of *O*OH and 
*OH*OH, both of which bind with the active sites through two metal atoms , compared with  
*OH binding through one metal  atom  (Fig. S10). The flexible dual -atom active sites induced 
decoupling binding strength between the key intermediates have been observed in other 
reactions, such as electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction and N 2 reduction.  [89–91]  Note that for the 
LD-DAC systems, comparatively, the scaling relationship between the binding strengths of key 
intermediates (Fig. S11) have the similar linear trends with the above UHD- DACs.  
E. ORR catalytic activity of UHD -DACs  
For the three ORR pathways, the reaction free energy diagram s on UHD-DACs under 
different  potentials  are shown in Fig. S12-S14, and the theoretical overpotentials ( ηORR) for the 
most favorable pathway are summarized in Fig . 3(e). We can observe that  the homonuclear 
Mn 2N6, Fe 2N6, and Co 2N6 UHD- DACs prefers to the pathway -C, in which the O-O bond of 
*OOH is broken and *OH*OH species is formed with each O atom binding with one metal 
atom. The heteronuclear UHD- DACs (except CoNiN 6 with pathway -A) tend to adopt the 
pathway -B, where the dissociated *OOH, i.e., *O*OH, is reduced to *O.  Among them, Fe 2N6 
and Co 2N6 UHD -DACs have the smallest ηORR of 0.31 and 0.33 V  along the optimal pathway-
C, respectively , delivering the highest ORR activity among all the UHD- DACs. Note that the 
ηORR of Fe 2N6 and Co 2N6 UHD- DACs are smaller than that for the state- art commercial Pt/C 
catalyst (0.45 V).  [1,92]  Moreover, interesti ngly, the Fe - and Co- based heteronuclear UHD-
DACs also have the relatively good catalytic activity, in which the MnFe N6, MnCo N6, FeCo N6, 
FeNi N6, and CoNi N6 UHD-DACs possess the ηORR of 0.66, 0.68, 0.51, 0.52 , and 0.59 V , 
respectively. For comparison, we also investigat ed the ORR activity over the corresponding 
LD-DACs, for which the free energy diagrams are presented in Fig . S15-17, and the ηORR of 
the optimal pathways are also summarized in Fig . 3(e). We can see the ηORR for all the UHD -
DACs  (except Co 2N6) are comparable with those  of the corresponding LD -DACs, indicating 
that the UHD-DACs can well maintain the intrinsic ORR activity of the active centers. Interestingly, the Co
2N6 UHD-DAC  even exhibits much higher ORR activity than its  LD-DAC  case. More significantly,  FeMnN 6, FeCoN 6, FeNiN 6, and FeZnN 6 DACs have been definitely 
determined to exhibit excellent catalytic performances for the ORR.  [23–26,28,29]  Overall,  the 
excellent stabilities and ORR catalytic activities render the proposed UHD- DACs promising 
ORR electrocatalysts with ultra -high-density active sites available.  
Moreover, we considered the competitive reactions on the UHD-DACs, including the two -
electr on ORR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show that most of the 
concerned UHD-DACs have the good selectivity for four -electron ORR toward H 2O (see the 
details in Supplemental Material  [31] with Table  S5). 
To better understand the ORR catalytic trend,  the ηORR as a function of  ΔG (*OH)  are 
plotted  in Fig. 4. It can be found that for the pathway -A (Fig. 4(a)), pathway -B (Fig. 4(b)), and 
pathway -C (Fig. 4(c)), when  ΔG (*OH) reaches about 0.9, 1.0, and 1.0 eV , respectively, the 
DAC systems possess the highest  ORR catalytic activity ( the lowest ηORR), and  the weaker or 
stronger  binding of *OH on the active sites will lead to the deteriorated ORR activity. 
Consequently, a volcanic relationship between ηORR and ΔG (*OH) can be observed for all the 
reaction pathways. T hus, ΔG (*OH) can serve as an effective ORR activity descriptor for the 
studied DAC systems. Moreover, for the optimal reaction pathways of each DAC (Fig . 4(d)), 
the appropriate binding strength of *OH on Fe2N6 and Co 2N6 UHD- DACs prompts the 
equilibrium between oxygenated species activation and catalyst recovery and then results in the 
highest  activity among all the UHD-DAC s.  
F. Spin as universal  descriptor for both UHD - and LD -DACs  
Recent studies show that the spin magnetic moment of the active center is a novel activity 
descriptor for the ORR on SACs, which is an  intrinsic physical property . [93] For example, the 
larger spin magnetic moments can induce a better catalytic activity for ORR on the FeN 4 based 
SACs because the spin electron s are beneficial for binding and activation of reaction 
intermediates . [94] Correspondingly , we investigated the possibility of the spin magnetic 
moment as ORR activity descriptor herein . Interestingly, as shown in Fig . 5(a), ΔG (*OH) for 
all UHD- and LD-DAC  systems  are correlated linearly with spin magnetic moments  MS of the 
metal atom that binds OH (R2 = 0.87), which shows that the larger spin magnetic moment 
contributes to the stronger adsorption of *OH . This strong linear correlation suggests that MS 
can function as an efficient descriptor to predict the ORR  catalytic activity. As expected, as 
shown in Fig . 5(b), the ηORR indeed exhibits a volcano relationship with M S, and importantly 
MS is a unified descriptor for both UHD- and LD -DAC  systems.   
Importantly, the excellent linear relationship between Δ G (*OH) and M S, and volcano 
relationship between Δ G (*OH) and ηORR, have also been confirmed by the HSE06 functional 
(Fig. S19).  From Fig. S19(a)  and Fig. S19(c) , there is a good linear scaling relationship between 
MS and ΔG (*OH) both for PBE and HSE methods, with the linear slope of -0.47 and - 0.35, respectively. The relatively smaller MS for magnetic active center by PBE method is responsible 
for the more negat ive slope, compared with that from HSE method. Moreover, there is a good 
volcanic relationship  for ηORR as a function of M S for PBE and HSE calculations ( Fig. S19(b)  
and Fig. S19(d) ). It is found that the critical M S corresponding to the theoretical optima l activity 
by PBE (0.94 μB) is smaller than that based on HSE functional (1.32 μB), which also stems from 
the smaller M S for magnetic active center by PBE method.  These results suggest that the spin 
related conclusions are reliable from PBE method , and as one of the key points in our work, 
spin magnetic moment of active center by PBE functional indeed can act as a catalytic 
descriptor for ORR on the DACs, similar to that by HSE functional.  
Finally, we explored the mechanism for the significantly enhanced OR R activity of Co2N6 
UHD- DAC  compared with its  LD-DAC  counterpart, for which the free energy diagrams are 
presented in Fig s. 6(a) and 6(b). From above, we know that excellent ORR activity of Co 2N6 
UHD- DAC results from its proper binding of *OH, which correlates with the spin magnetic 
moment of the active center. Therefore, we comparatively studied the spin magnetic states of 
Co2N6 UHD-DAC and LD-DAC. As presented  in Figs. 6(c)  and 6(d), the PDOS  show that the 
Co 3d orbitals are asymmetric in UHD -DAC system while symmetric in LD -DAC system, 
indicating the (non)magnetic states of Co atoms for (LD -) UHD- DAC.  Moreover,  the Co d x2, 
dxz, and d yz in-plane orbital s mainly contribute to the spin magnetic moment of the  Co atom in 
UHD- DAC .  
Based on the crystal field theory, t he Co cation  in the CoN 4 square planar crystal field for 
SAC system possesses the 3 d7 electronic configuration,  [95] which  should have the unpaired 
electrons and give rise to the spin magnetic state. However, in the current DAC systems, there 
are double CoN 4 square planar crystal field  interacting  each other . For the Co 2N6 LD-DAC, the 
short Co-Co distance (2.25 Å) can  intensively share the d  orbital electrons, resulting in the 
faultlessly pairing of in -plane d orbital electrons ( dx2, dxz, and d yz) and the completely quenching 
of spin magnetic moment in LD -DAC.  In contrast, a large Co -Co distance (2.45 Å)  in UHD-
DAC  contribute s to the retention of the spin magnetic moment.  The spin density distribution in 
the illustration s of Figs. 6(c)  and 6(d) can also confirm our above analysis about  the difference 
of spin magnetic states between Co 2N6 UHD- and LD -DACs.   
In addition, we studied the electronic state interaction between Co 3 d and *OH 2 sp, for 
which the PDOS are presented in Fig . S20, and furthermore a quantitative analysis in Figs. 6(e)  
and 6(f), resorting to  the crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP) . For Co2N6 UHD-DAC , 
the adsorption of *OH almost leads to the complete spin quenching of the Co atom that binds it (see Fig . S20), and thus the spin-up and spin-down bands contribute similar binding strengths 
with the integrated COHP (ICOHP) of -1.23 and - 1.16 eV , respectivel y. On the contrary, for 
Co
2N6 LD-DAC, the adsorption of *OH can induce spin magnetic moment on the Co atoms. 
Significantly , spin-up bands contribute the similar binding strength,  compared with the case of Co2N6 UHD-DAC, with ICOHP of -1.20 eV , while much more occupation of the antibonding 
state for spin -down bands leads to the much smaller contribution to *OH binding with ICOHP 
of -0.85 eV .  Consequently, Co 2N6 UHD-DAC binds *OH much stronger than Co 2N6 UHD -
DAC, and exhibits high ORR activity. 
Ⅳ. CONCLUSIONS  
In summary, we theoretically confirm ed the existence of ultra-high -density DACs with 
metal loading  > 40 wt%, constructed  from the experimentally synthesized  M2N6 motif . Among 
the investigated systems, ten ones ( Mn 2N6, Fe 2N6, Co 2N6, Ni 2N6, MnFeN 6, MnCoN 6, MnNiN 6, 
FeCoN 6, FeNiN 6, and CoNiN 6) were demonstrated to have well dynamic, thermal, mechanical, 
thermodynamic, and electrochemical stabilities . Mechanism studies on ORR show that  most of 
the UHD-DACs have comparable ORR activities with the corresponding LD -DACs, and Fe 2N6 
and Co 2N6 UHD- DACs locate at the peak of the activity volcano with the ultra -low 
overpotentials of 0.31 and 0.33 V , respectively . Furthermore, we investigated the relationship 
between the ORR activities and the spin states of the active centers, and identified that the spin magnetic moment of active centers of the DACs can serve as an effective catalytic descriptor. 
Interestingly, C o
2N6 UHD-DACs exhibit significantly enhanced ORR activity compared with 
the Co 2N6 LD counterpart, which can be ascribed to the distortion of the square planar crystal 
field induced spin state crossover. In addition, the simulated STM images and symmetry 
classifications of phonon modes for the UH D-DAC systems provide a basis for the future 
experimental confirmation . We hope our prediction will simulate the experimental exploration 
of ultra -high -density DACs for practical catalytic applications, and the ident ified activity 
descriptor, spin  magnetic moment, will guide the rational design of efficient DACs based on 
spin-state regulation.

Herein, we have investigated the competitive reactions on the UHD-DACs, including 
the two-electron ORR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For competitive two-
electron ORR toward H 2O2 production, the Gibbs free energy of *O ( ΔG (*O)) for a 
catalyst with a high selectivity should be more positive than 3.52 eV . [59] Our results 
showed that the Δ G (*O)  for most of the UHD -DACs are less than 3.52 eV , indicating 
their poor selectivity for two -electron ORR toward H 2O2. Only one exception, i.e., Ni 2N6 
UHD- DAC, has the larger ΔG (*O) with 4.23 eV , which  indeed exhibits high two -electron 
ORR selectivity. Herein, we consider the four -electron ORR toward H 2O on Ni 2N6 UHD-
DAC with the aim to investigate the activity descriptor for all DAC systems.  For 
competitive HER, we calculated the *H adsorption on various UHD- DACs and the 
comparison results of Δ G (*H) and ∆ G1 (ORR) (here Δ G1 = ΔG (*OOH ) – 4.92)) are 
organized in Table S5. We found that all the UHD -DACs have the positive Δ G (*H) values 
but nega tive ∆ G1 (ORR) values, indicating that they have a strong ability to suppress the 
competing HER.

the primitive cell and the black solid lines denote the conventional cell.  We can find our 
constructed UHD-DAC  and experimentally prepared  LD-DAC both have the same active cent er, 
i.e., metal dimers with the same N coordination ( M2N6 with two MN 4 motifs). The difference 
is that they contain different amounts of carbon in their substrate, resulting in different metal 
contents and densities of active site.

Note S1. Solvation effect  
Herein, the water configurations and solvation effects of the intermediates were obtained 
by molecular dynamics simulations (combining force -field molecular dynamic simulation 
implemented in LAMMPS [69] and ab initio  molecular dynamic simulation in V ASPsol  [67]). 
The details are present below:  
Firstly, we constructed a random explicit water model with a density of about 1 g/cm3, 
including 20 H 2O molecules. For this explicit solvent model with 20 H 2O molecules, we used 
the LAMMPS to conduct TIP3P [70] force -field molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for 5 ns 
with the NVT ensemble at 300 K. Then we added this explicit water model by LAMMPS to the 
catalyst surface to implement the ab initio  MD simulations (AIMD) by V AS Psol for 3 ps at 300 
K. The final structures are used to obtain the explicit solvation energies of reaction species. The 
explicit structure model with 20 explicit water molecules for various adsorbed species on 
Mn 2N6 UHD-DAC are shown in Fig. S21  and the explicit solvation energies for different 
adsorbed species are shown in the Table S6 . It is found that the solvation energies from the  
continuum solvation model by V ASPsol  are comparable with those from our explicit model and 
those of previous work with explicit model.  [71] Moreover, the explicit solvation effect doesn ’t 
alter their optimal reaction pathway for ORR on both UHD - and LD -DACs ( Table S 7). 
Importantly, the solvation effect has a small influence on the η ORR values, for which Fe 2N6 and 
Co2N6 UHD-DACs still have the smallest ηORR and deliver the highest ORR activity among all 
the UHD- DACs. These results indicate the reasonability of our computational methods for the 
ORR activity.
