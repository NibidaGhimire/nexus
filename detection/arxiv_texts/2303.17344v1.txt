arXiv:2303.17344v1  [math.AT]  30 Mar 2023Topological Hochschild homology, truncated Brown-Peters on
spectra, and a topological Sen operator
S. K. Devalapurkar
Abstract. In this article, we study the topological Hochschild homolo gy of
E3-forms of truncated Brown-Peterson spectra, taken relativ e to certain Thom
spectraX(pn)(introduced by Ravenel and used by Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith
in the proof of the nilpotence theorem). We prove analogues o f Bökstedt’s
calculations THH(Fp)≃Fp[ΩS3]andTHH(Zp)≃Zp[ΩS3/an}bracketle{t3/an}bracketri}ht]. We also con-
struct a topological analogue of the Sen operator of Bhatt-L urie-Drinfeld, and
study a higher chromatic extension. The behavior of these “t opological Sen
operators” is dictated by diﬀerentials in the Serre spectra l sequence for Cohen-
Moore-Neisendorfer ﬁbrations.

1. Introduction
1.1. Summary. Fix a prime p. A fundamental calculation of Bökstedt’s
[Bö85 ] says thatπ∗THH(Fp)is isomorphic to a polynomial ring Fp[σ]with|σ|= 2.
Recent work of Hahn-Wilson shows that this polynomiality ph enomenon persists at
higher heights, provided one works relative to MUinstead of the sphere. Namely,
[HW20 , Theorem E] states that if BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htis anE3-form of the truncated Brown-
Peterson spectrum, then π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU)is a polynomial algebra over π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht
on generators in even degree. Moreover, the ﬁrst such genera tor is the double sus-
pensionσ2(vn+1).
In this article, we will show that the “polynomial THH” phenomenon persists
if one instead considers THH relative to the Ravenel spectra X(pn), introduced in
[Rav84 ] and used by [ DHS88 ] in the proof of the nilpotence theorem. Motivated
by [Dev23a ], the thesis of this article is that many statements involvi ng the study
ofFp- orZp-algebras relative to the sphere spectrum admit natural gen eralizations
when studying BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht- orBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-algebras relative to X(pn). Many of the results
presented here were motivated by the perspective that there should be a chromatic
analogue of integral p-adic Hodge theory (where pis replaced by the chromatic
elementvn; see Figure 1)1.
TheEfr
2-ringX(pn)is the Thom spectrum of the Efr
2-mapΩSU(pn)→ΩSU≃
BU, so thatX(1) =S0andX(∞) = MU . Just as MU(p)splits as a direct sum of
shifts of BP, the spectrum X(pn)(p)splits into a direct sum of shifts of an E1-ring
denoted2T(n). IfCis a leftX(pn)-linear∞-category, then [ DHL+23, Corollary
2.9 and Corollary 3.7] ensures that it makes sense to deﬁne th e relative topolog-
ical Hochschild homology THH( C/X(pn)), and furthermore that THH( C/X(pn))
admits anS1-action.3
Our main result is an analogue of Bökstedt’s calculation. If Ris a ring
spectrum, let R[B∆n]denote the free R-module whose homotopy groups are iso-
morphic to a divided power algebra π∗(R)/an}b∇acketle{tyi|1≤i≤pn−1,i/ne}ationslash=pk/an}b∇acket∇i}htwhere|yj|=
2j.4Morally,R[B∆n]is theR-chains on the “classifying space of/producttextn
i=1SU(pi−
1)/SU(pi−1)”; so, ifXis another space, we will write R[B∆n×X]to denote
R[B∆n]⊗RR[X]. Fix an E3-form of the truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht(which exists by [ HW20 , Theorem A]). Motivated by the results of
[Dev23a ], and using the calculations of [ AR05, BR05 ], we show:
Theorem (Theorem 2.2.4(a)) .There is ap-complete equivalence
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[B∆n×ΩS2pn+1]
1I’d also like to direct the reader to https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/art-artists/
work-of-art/prismatic-colour-wheel ; but I hope our Figure 1 is more mathematically
informative!
2This is notthe telescope of a vn-self map! See Warning 2.1.6.
3We warn the reader that even if Cadmits the structure of a monoidal ∞-category,
THH( C/X(pn))rarely inherits any multiplicative structure from C, sinceX(pn)does not ad-
mit the structure of an E3-ring (see Remark 2.1.3).
4The contribution B∆nplays essentially no practical/meaningful role in this art icle. Its
appearance in the equivalences below can be removed if T(n)⊆X(pn)(p)admits the structure of
anEfr
2-algebra. We strongly believe this to be possible (enough to state it as Conjecture 2.1.9!),
so we suggest the reader ignore B∆n— and simultaneously replace X(pn)byT(n)— on a ﬁrst

ofBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-modules; in particular, there is a p-complete isomorphism
π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))≃π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[B∆n][θn],
whereθn∈π2pnTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))isσ2(vn).
Moreover, there are p-complete isomorphisms
π∗TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))∼=π∗(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[B∆n])[[/planck⋊ver2pi1]][θn]/(θn/planck⋊ver2pi1−vn),
π∗TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))∼=π∗(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1[B∆n]),
where/planck⋊ver2pi1∈π−2BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}hthS1. Under the map TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))→TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU),
the image of vn∈π2pn−2TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))can be identiﬁed with the image of
vn∈π2pn−2MUtS1under the map MUtS1→TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU).
Remark 1.1.1. IfT(n)⊆X(pn)(p)admits the structure of an Efr
2-algebra (Conjec-
ture 2.1.9), then Theorem 2.2.4 would give the cleaner state ments that THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))≃
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[ΩS2pn+1], and that π∗TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))∼=π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1. The map
π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))→π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU)is injective, and exhibits the
source as the submodule π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[σ2(vn)]ofπ∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU).
Theorem 2.2.4 implies the following result, which, for n= 0, is a very special
case of the main result of [ PV19 ]:
Corollary (Proposition 3.3.8) .LetR= BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[Zj
≥0]be a ﬂat polynomial ring
overBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht, viewed as a Zj
≥0-gradedEfr
2-BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-algebra. Then there is a p-complete
isomorphism of Zj
≥0-graded modules equipped with a map from π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1[B∆n]∼=
π∗TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn)):
π∗TPgr((R/vn)/X(pn))∼=π∗HPgr(R/BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)[B∆n].
Here, the superscript grdenotes the Tate construction taken in Zj
≥0-graded spectra.
Remark 1.1.2. Theorem 2.2.4 quickly implies redshift for K(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)(see
Corollary 2.2.9). When n= 0, the ﬁrst part of Theorem 2.2.4(a) recovers Bök-
stedt’s calculation of THH(Fp), sinceBP/an}b∇acketle{t−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht=FpandX(0) =S0. Whenp= 2,
the statement of Theorem 2.2.4 can be simpliﬁed using [ Dev23a , Remark 3.1.9];
for instance, we obtain the following additive equivalences and isomorphisms: for
n= 1, we have
THH(Z2/T(1))≃Z2[σ2(v1)], π∗TP(Z2/T(1))∧
2≃π∗(kutS1)∧

Sincetmf1(3)is a form of BP/an}b∇acketle{t2/an}b∇acket∇i}htby [LN14 ], forn= 2, we have

2/T(2))≃ku∧
2[σ2(v2)], π∗TP(ku∧
2/T(2))∧
2≃π∗(tmf1(3)tS1)∧
2.
We also prove an analogue of Bökstedt’s calculation [ Bö85 ] ofTHH(Zp):
Theorem (Theorem 2.2.4(b)) .There is an equivalence of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-modules

simplicity that T(m)admits the structure of a framed E2-ring.
•The spectra sandwiched between diagonal lines of slope 1(partitioned by a red
line) display similar structural behaviour. Here, AandBare studied in [ Mah79 ]
(whereAis denotedX5), [Dev19 , Construction 3.1], and [ HM02 ].
•The horizontal double arrows indicate the topological Sen o perators of Theo-
rem 3.1.4, i.e., the descent spectral sequence for the map THH(−/T(n−1))→
THH(−/T(n)). This is closely related to the Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer m ap
Ω2S2pn+1→S2pn−1.
•The (slightly oﬀset) vertical dashed lines going from (n,n−1)to(n,n)indi-

orem 2.2.4. The other vertical arrow from (0,0)to(0,1)is the identiﬁcation of
THH(Zp)withτ≥0(jtZ/p), which will appear in future work with Arpon Raksit.
(Here,jis the connective complex image-of-J spectrum.) This equiv alence is al-
ready predicted by the pioneering work of Bökstedt-Madsen i n [BM94 ].
•The downwards-sloping blue arrows indicate that THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n+ 1))/vnis

ple 4.2.2, Remark 4.2.4, and Example 4.2.6 for an explanatio n of this phenomenon
using the EHP sequence.
•The columns continue inﬁnitely far out (i.e., THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(m))form>n ).
However, the drawing is truncated because these terms do not detect any more
information than THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))itself. The “exception” is the ﬁnal column,
where the descent from THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/BP)toTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)can be described
algebro-geometrically via the p-typical Witt ring scheme.6 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Remark 1.1.3. If one replaces X(pn)in the left-hand side of Theorem 2.2.4(b)
withX(pn+1−1), the only change to the right-hand side is that B∆nis replaced
byB∆n+1. Let us mention the following mild variant of Theorem 2.2.4 ( see (4)):
theFp[vn−j,···,vn−1]-moduleπ∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj))/(p,···,vn−1−j)is iso-
morphic to the tensor product of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[ΩS2pn+1×B∆j]/(p,···,vn−1−j)∗with
an exterior algebra on classes λj+1,···,λn, where|λm|= 2pm−1. We also prove
an analogue of Theorem 2.2.4 for koandtmfin Appendix A. For example, if the
spectraAandB[Dev23a , Section 3] lift to Efr
2-rings, there are 2-complete equiv-
alences
THH(ko/A)≃ko⊕

j≥1Σ8j−1ko/2j
,
THH(tmf/B)≃tmf⊕
/circleplusdisplay
j≥1Σ16j−1tmf/2j
.
Remark 1.1.4. If Conjecture 2.1.9 (or rather, a weaker version which only a sks
thatT(n)admit the structure of an Efr
2-ring) were true, then the contribution
ofB∆ncould be eliminated from Theorem 2.2.4(b): namely, there wo uld be a
p-complete equivalence

j≥1Σ2jpn+1−1BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/pj.
We warn the reader that all the equivalences proved above are only additive,
so one cannot directly use them to study the stacks associate d toTHH (deﬁned
via the even ﬁltration of [ HRW22 ]). As a perhaps more digestible example of
this phenomenon (see Remark 2.3.16), note that since F2is the Thom spectrum of
anE1-mapU(2)→BGL1(ku), there is an equivalence HH(F2/ku)≃F2[BU(2)] ;
however, this cannot be upgraded to an equivalence of F2-algebras, since the right-
hand side is not even obviously a ring!
In Example 4.2.2, Remark 4.2.4, and Example 4.2.6, we use the EHP se-
quence to explain the similarity in the calculation of THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn+1))and
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))given by Theorem 2.2.4. This discussion in fact yields
the following more general structural uniformity in the tru ncated Brown-Peterson
spectra (see Figure 1 for a visual illustration):
Slogan 1.1.5 (Remark 4.2.3 and Remark 4.2.5 for precise statements) .Ifn≥j−1,
the structure of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htas anE1-X(pj)-algebra (i.e., THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj))) mirrors
the structure of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htas anE1-X(pj−1)-algebra (i.e., THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj−1))),
which in turn mirrors the structure of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−j/an}b∇acket∇i}htas anE1-algebra over the sphere
(i.e.,THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−j/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)).
LetCbe a leftX(pn)-linear∞-category. Then, the descent spectral sequence
fromTHH relative toX(pn)toTHH relative toX(pn−1)runs:
Theorem (Theorem 3.1.4) .There is a map ΘC: Σ−2pnTHH( C/X(pn))→THH( C/X(pn))
such that there is a coﬁber sequence
(1)THH( C/X(pn−1))ι− →THH( C/X(pn))ΘC− − →Σ2pnTHH( C/X(pn)),
where the map ιisS1-equivariant, and the coﬁber of ιis (at least nonequivariantly)
identiﬁed with Σ2pnTHH( C/X(pn)).THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 7
Remark 1.1.6. Motivated by [ BL22a, Dri22 ], we dub the map ΘCthetopological
Sen operator ; its construction is motivated by the work of [ Dev23a ] relating BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht
to Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer type ﬁber sequences (11). Whe nC= LMod BP/angb∇acketleftn−1/angb∇acket∇ight,
Theorem 2.2.4 implies that the map Θsends
Θ :θj
n/mapsto→jpθj−1
n.
Whenn= 1, it therefore behaves like the Sen operator on the diﬀracted Hodge
complex of Zpwhich computes ∆Zp{∗}.
Remark 1.1.7. In Appendix A (see Remark A.24), we describe a quaternionic
analogue of (1), obtained by replacing X(n)by the Thom spectrum XH(n)of
the tautological symplectic bundle over Ω(SU(2n)/Sp(n))obtained via the map
Ω(SU(2n)/Sp(n))→Ω(SU/Sp)≃BSpgiven by Bott periodicity.
In Construction 2.3.1, we deﬁne an Efr
2-ringJ(p)which admits an Efr
2-map
J(p)→X(p)such that THH(T(1)/J(p))≃T(1)[Jp−1(S2)]. The underlying E1-
ring ofJ(p)isS[Z] =S[t±1]with|t|= 0, but they diﬀer as Efr
2-rings. The raison
d’être forJ(p)is thatTHH(Zp/J(p))is polynomial on a class xin degree 2which
is apth root ofθ∈π2pTHH(Zp/X(p)). More precisely, there is an equivalence
THH(Zp/J(p))≃Zp[ΩS3]such that the map THH(Zp/J(p))→THH(Zp/X(p))
is induced by Zp-chains of the Hopf map ΩS3→ΩS2p+1. In Construction 2.3.9,
we also construct two Efr
2-rings (as Thom spectra over ΩU(2) andΩSpin(4) ) which
play the role of J(p)forkuwhenp= 2.
We construct the following coﬁber sequence analogous to (1) for anyJ(p)-linear
∞-category C:
THH( C)ι− →THH( C/J(p))Θ′
C− − →Σ2THH( C/J(p)).
It turns out that upon reducing the above coﬁber sequence mod p, one obtains the
following important example:
Example 1.1.8. IfCis aZp-linear∞-category, there is a coﬁber sequence (see
Variant 3.1.10)
(2) THH( C)⊗ZpFpι− →THH( C⊗ZpFp)Θ′
− →Σ2THH( C⊗ZpFp).
When C= Mod Zp, the eﬀect of the map Θ′on homotopy is given by the map
Fp[σ]→Σ2Fp[σ]which sends σj/mapsto→jσj−1. There is also a coﬁber sequence
(3)THH( C)tZ/p⊗ZpFpι− →HP(C⊗ZpFp/Fp)Θ′
− →HP(C⊗ZpFp/Fp).
IfC= ModRfor an animated Zp-algebraR, we expect the maps in (2) and (3) to
respect the motivic ﬁltrations. Taking gri
mot[−2i]would then produce the following
coﬁber sequences involving the associated graded pieces of the Nygaard ﬁltration
on the prismatic cohomologies of RandR/p:
(Niˆ∆R)/p→Fconj
idR(R/p)/Fp→Fconj
i−1dR(R/p)/Fp,
∆R/p→dR(R/p)/Fp→dR(R/p)/Fp.
Such coﬁber sequences on Hodge-Tate cohomology do indeed ex ist, and can be con-
structed purely algebraically using the methods of [ BM22 ] and [BL22a , Proposi-
tion 6.4.8]; see (19) and (21).
We also show by explicit calculation:8 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Proposition (Example 3.3.3 and Proposition 3.3.11 for precise statemen ts).There
is an isomorphism π∗TP(Zp[t]/X(p))∼=π∗HP(BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht).
Furthermore, the map TPgr(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/X(pn))→TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))is
an equivalence after K(n)-localization, and Conjecture 2.2.18 implies that (up to a
Nygaard-type completion) LK(n)TP(−/X(pn))isA1-invariant.
We also have:
Conjecture (Conjecture 3.1.14 and Conjecture 3.3.5) .LetRbe an animated Zp-
algebra, and let Fconj
⋆/hatwideΩ/D
Rdenote the conjugate-ﬁltered ( p-completed) diﬀracted Hodge
complex of [BL22a , Construction 4.7.1] . Then THH(R/J(p))admits a motivic
ﬁltration such that gri
motTHH(R/J(p))≃(Fconj
i/hatwideΩ/D
R)[2i], and such that the map
Θ′
R: THH(R/J(p))→Σ2THH(R/J(p))respects the motivic ﬁltration and induces
the map Θ+i: Fconj
i/hatwideΩ/D
R→Fconj
i−1/hatwideΩ/D
Rongri
mot.
Similarly, THH(R/X(p))admits a motivic ﬁltration such that gri
motTHH(R/X(p))≃
(Fconj
pi/hatwideΩ/D
R)[2pi]⊗RR[BSU(p−1)]. Moreover, TP(R/X(p))admits a motivic ﬁltra-
tionF⋆
motTP(R/X(p))such that gri
motTP(R/X(p))≃ˆ∆R/Zp[[/tildewidep]][2i]⊗RǫR, where
ˆ∆R/Zp[[/tildewidep]]is the Nygaard completion of /tildewidepΩR.
In Section 3, we supplement Conjecture 3.1.14 with some exam ples (such as R
being ap-complete perfectoid ring, R=Z/pnfor oddp,Rbeing a complete DVR
of mixed characteristic (0,p), andR=Zp[t]).
Remark 1.1.9. For the case R=Z/pn, we give “two” calculations of the diﬀracted
Hodge complex /hatwideΩ/D
Z/pn; one uses abstract properties of the diﬀracted Hodge comple x
(and was explained to us by Bhatt), and the other (provided in Appendix B) is
via concrete calculations in the ring W(Zp). In particular, in Corollary 3.2.15, we
reﬁne the calculation of [ BL22b , Example 5.15] to show that there is an equivalence
WCartHT
Z/pn∼=G♯
a/G♯
mof stacks over Z/pn.
In Section 3.4, we also study an analogue of the Segal conject ure forTHH
relative toJ(p)andT(n). One interesting consequence (Proposition 3.4.7) is that
ifRis ap-torsionfree discrete commutative ring such that R/pis regular Noetherian
andLΩn
R= 0forn≫0, then [ BL22a , Remark 4.7.4] and Conjecture 3.1.14 imply
thatRsatisﬁes a version of the Segal conjecture for THH relative toJ(p).
In Proposition 3.5.3, we prove an analogue of the Cartier iso morphism in
Hochschild homology for a ﬂat polynomial algebra over any E2-ring, and show that
it specializes to homotopical analogues of several known ex amples of the Cartier
isomorphism. (This is quite likely well-known to some exper ts, but we could not
ﬁnd a source.)
Proposition (Proposition 3.5.3) .LetRbe anE2-ring. Then there is a S1-
equivariant map C: HH(RtZ/p[t]/RtZ/p)→HH(R[t]/R)tZ/psendingt/mapsto→tp, where
S1acts onHH(R[t]/R)tZ/pvia the residual S1/µp-action, and on HH(RtZ/p[t]/RtZ/p)
via the diagonal action on Hochschild homology and residual S1/µp-action onRtZ/p.
Iftis given weight 1, thenCinduces anS1-equivariant equivalence HH(RtZ/p[t]/RtZ/p)wt≤m→
(HH(R[t]/R)wt≤mp)tZ/pof gradedRtZ/p-modules.
In Section 4, we describe the topological Sen operator from t he perspective
of the moduli stack MFGof formal groups. We begin by describing an algebraic
analogue of THH. This is given by an Adams-Novikov analogue of the BökstedtTHH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 9
spectral sequence: if Ris ap-local homotopy commutative ring such that MU∗(R)is
concentrated in even degrees, one can deﬁne a stack MRwhose coherent cohomology
is theE2-page of the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for R(see [DFHH14 ,
Chapter 9]).
Proposition (Remark 4.1.5) .Ifgr•
evTHH(R)denotes the associated graded of the
even ﬁltration of [HRW22 ]onTHH(R)(which recovers the motivic ﬁltration on
THH(R)of[BMS19 ]whenRis quasisyntomic), then there is a spectral sequence:
π∗HH(MR/MFG)⇒π∗gr•
evTHH(R).
There is also an analogue for relative THH.
This spectral sequence behaves essentially like the Bökste dt spectral sequence in
most examples. In particular, if R→R′is a map of p-local homotopy commutative
rings whose MU-homologies are concentrated in even degrees, then HH(MR/MR′)
can be viewed as the “Adams-Novikov-Bökstedtassociated gr aded” ofgr•
evTHH(R/R′).
Motivated by this perspective, we describe an analogue of th e topological Sen oper-
ator of Theorem 3.1.4 as a Gauss-Manin connection on stacks r elated to MFG(see
Example 4.1.11):
Theorem (Example 4.1.11 and Variant 4.1.13) .The stack MT(n)is isomorphic to
the moduli stack of graded p-typical formal groups equipped with a p-typical coordi-
nate of order ≤pn. Moreover, the Adams-Novikov analogue of Theorem 3.1.4 is a
ﬁber sequence
HH(X/MT(n−1))→HH(X/MT(n))Θmot− −− →Σ2pn,pnHH(X/MT(n))
associated to any stack X→MT(n), whereΣn,wdenotes a shift by homological
degreenand weight w.
Similarly, there is a ﬁber sequence
HH(X/MFG)→HH(X/MJ(p))Θmot− −− →Σ2,1HH(X/MJ(p))
associated to any stack X→MJ(p).
Remark 1.1.10. In Appendix A (Proposition A.23 and Remark A.24), we also
study a quaternionic analogue of the above ﬁber sequence. Th is description crucially
relies on the twistor ﬁbration CP2n−1→HPn−1, which is given in coordinates by
the map [z1:···:z2n]/mapsto→[z1+z2j:···:z2n−1+z2nj].
1.2. Some complements. In Conjecture 2.2.18, we suggest that the identiﬁ-
cation ofπ∗TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))can be extended to an equivalence TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))≃
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1[B∆n]of spectra:
Conjecture (Conjecture 2.2.18) .The spectrum THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))admits
the structure of an S1-equivariant BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-module, and the isomorphism π∗TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))∼=
π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1lifts to an equivalence of spectra TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1.
This discussion suggests viewing the pair (π0BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1,([p](/planckover2pi1)
/planckover2pi1))as a higher chro-
matic analogue of the crystalline prism (Zp,(p)), where/planck⋊ver2pi1is the complex orientation
ofBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htand[p](/planck⋊ver2pi1)is itsp-series. Note that the pair (π0BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1,([p](/planckover2pi1)
/planckover2pi1))has no
reason to naturally admit the structure of a prism.
Finally, it would be interesting to know whether Slogan 1.1. 5 can be used to
prove [ Lee22 , Conjecture 6.1]. A ﬁrst step in this direction would be to sh ow that10 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
the topological Sen operators on THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj)),THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj−1)),
..., andTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−j/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)can also be matched up under the structural uniformity
of Slogan 1.1.5. (Also see Remark 2.2.5.)
This article suggests several directions in which the work p resented here can be
extended; we have recorded these as Conjecture 2.1.9, Conje cture 2.2.18, Con-
jecture 2.3.22, Conjecture 3.1.14, the closely related Con jecture 3.3.5, Conjec-
ture 3.3.16, and Conjecture A.2. We wish to emphasize that, u nlike [Dev23a ,
Theorem A and Corollary B], the main results of this article a re entirely uncondi-
tional, and can be viewed as (in our opinion, substantial) ev idence for the conjec-
tures presented here and in [ Dev23a ].

2. Calculation of THH
2.1. Review of X(pn).
Deﬁnition 2.1.1 (Ravenel, [ Rav84 , Section 3]) .LetX(n)denote the Thom spec-
trum of the E2-mapΩSU(n)⊆BUJ− →BGL1(S), where the ﬁrst map arises from
Bott periodicity.
Example 2.1.2. TheE2-ringX(1)is the sphere spectrum, while X(∞)isMU.
Since the map ΩSU(n)→BUis an equivalence in dimensions ≤2n−2, the same
is true for the map X(n)→MU; the ﬁrst dimension in which X(n)has an element
in its homotopy which is not detected by MUis2n−1. In other words, writing
π∗MU =Z[b1,b2,···]with|bi|= 2i, the classes b1,···,bn−1lift toX(n); there is
an inclusion Z[b1,···,bn−1]⊆π∗X(n).
Remark 2.1.3. TheE2-structure on X(n)doesnotextend to an E3-structure
(see [Law19 , Example 1.5.31]).
After localizing at a prime p, the spectrum MUsplits as a wedge of suspensions
ofBP; this splitting comes from the Quillen idempotent on MU. The same is true
of theX(n)spectra, as explained in [ Rav86 , Section 6.5]: a multiplicative map
X(n)(p)→X(n)(p)is determined by a polynomial f(x) =/summationtext
0≤i≤n−1aixi+1, with
a0= 1andai∈π2i(X(n)(p)). One can use this to deﬁne a truncated form of the
Quillen idempotent ǫnonX(n)(p)(see [Hop84 , Proposition 1.3.7]), and thereby
obtain a summand of X(n)(p). We summarize the necessary results in the following
theorem.
Theorem 2.1.4. Letnbe such that pn≤k≤pn+1−1. ThenX(k)(p)splits as a
wedge of suspensions of the spectrum T(n) =ǫpn·X(pn)(p).
•T(n)admits the structure of an E1-ring such that the map T(n)→X(pn)
is a map of E1-rings (see [BL21 , Section 7.5] ).
•The mapT(n)→BPis an equivalence in dimensions ≤ |vn+1| −2, so
there is an indecomposable element vi∈π∗T(n)which maps to an inde-
composable element in π∗BPfor0≤i≤n. In particular (by (a)), there
is an inclusion Z(p)[v1,···,vn]⊆π∗T(n).
•The mapT(n)→BPinduces the inclusion BP∗T(n) = BP ∗[t1,···,tn]⊆
BP∗(BP)onBP-homology, and the inclusions F2[ζ2
1,···,ζ2
n]⊆F2[ζ2
1,ζ2
2,···]
andFp[ζ1,···,ζn]⊆Fp[ζ1,ζ2,···]on mod2and modphomology, respec-
tively.
Example 2.1.5. TheE1-ringT(1)is the Thom spectrum of the E1-mapΩS2p−1→
BGL1(S)which detects α1∈π2p−2BGL1(S)∼=π2p−3Son the bottom cell of
ΩS2p−1. Sincepα1= 0, a nullhomotopy of pα1deﬁnes a class v1∈π2p−2T(1).
Under the unit map T(1)→BP, this class is sent to the eponymous class v1∈
π2p−2BP.
Warning 2.1.6. Unfortunately, Theorem 2.1.4 leads to an egregious clash of no-
tation, since T(n)is also often used to denote the telescope of a vn-self map of a
ﬁnite typenspectrum. In this article, we will onlyuseT(n)to mean the E1-ring
from Theorem 2.1.4. We propose using the notation Tel(n)to denote the telescope
of avn-self map.12 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Notation 2.1.7. IfRis a commutative ring, we write ΛR(x)to denote an exterior
R-algebra on a class x, andR/an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}htto denote a divided power R-algebra on a class x.
The notation γj(x)denotes the jth divided power of x, so thatj!γj(x) =xj. We
will also often write R/an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}htto denote the underlying R-module of R/an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht.
Construction 2.1.8. Deﬁne a space ∆nby
∆n=n/productdisplay
i=1SU(pi−1)/SU(pi−1),
and let∆idenote the ith term in this product. If Ris a ring spectrum, write
R[Ω∆n]to denote the E2-polynomial R-algebraR[xi|1≤i≤pn−1,i/ne}ationslash=pk−1],
where|xi|= 2i. LetR[B∆n]denote the 2-fold bar construction of the augmen-
tationR[Ω∆n]→R, so that it is an E2-R-coalgebra whose homotopy groups are
isomorphic to π∗(R)/an}b∇acketle{tyi|1≤i≤pn−1,i/ne}ationslash=pk/an}b∇acket∇i}htwhere|yj|= 2j. As mentioned in
the introduction, R[B∆n]morally should be viewed as the R-chains on the “classi-
fying space of/producttextn
i=1SU(pi−1)/SU(pi−1)”; to this end, if Xis another space, we will
writeR[B∆n×X]to denoteR[B∆n]⊗RR[X]; and ifRis a discrete ring, we will
often write H∗(B∆n;R)to denoteπ∗R[B∆n]. The factor R[B∆n]will primarily
be an unfortunate annoyance in this article. Note that ∆1= SU(p−1). Then, we
haveX(pn) =T(n)[Ω∆n]andX(pn−1) =T(n−1)[Ω∆n], so that
H∗(X(2n);F2)∼=F2[ζ2
1,···,ζ2
n]⊗FpH∗(Ω∆n;Fp),
H∗(X(pn);Fp)∼=Fp[ζ1,···,ζn]⊗FpH∗(Ω∆n;Fp),
and similarly for X(pn−1).
It is believed that T(n)admits more structure (see also [ AQ17 ] for some dis-
cussion):
Conjecture 2.1.9. TheQ1-ring structure on T(n)extends to a framed E2-ring
structure.
Remark 2.1.10. Whenp= 2, bothX(2) =T(1)andT(2)admit the structure of
Efr
2-algebras by [ DHL+23, Remark 3.8]: they are Thom spectra of U-bundles over
ΩSp(1)≃ΩS3andΩSp(2) , respectively. These U-bundles are deﬁned via double
loops of the the composite
BSp(n)→BSU(2n)→BSU≃B3U.
Proposition 2.1.11 ([DHL+23, Corollary 2.9 and Corollary 3.7]) .TheE2-structure
onX(n)reﬁnes to an Efr
2-structure.
Corollary 2.1.12. LetCbe anX(n)-linear∞-category. Then THH( C/X(n))
acquires the structure of an S1-equivariant spectrum with an S1-equivariant unit
mapX(n)→THH( C/X(n)).

erwise, all ﬁber sequences in this section (as well as the fol lowing sections) will be

Recollection 2.2.1. There are isomorphisms

∼=H∗(T(n);Fp)⊗FpFp[ζj|j≥n+1]⊗FpΛFp[τj|j≥n],p>2.
We note that the “ Q0-Margolis homology” of H∗(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;F2)(i.e., the homology
ofSq1viewed as a diﬀerential acting on H∗(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;F2)) is precisely H∗(T(n);F2),
becauseSq1is a derivation and Sq1(ζj) =ζ2
j−1.
Recollection 2.2.2. We need to recall some results from [ HW20 ]. First, [ HW20 ,
Theorem A] tells us that there exists an E3-form ofBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. First, [ HW20 , Theorem
2.5.4] states that π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU)is isomorphic to a polynomial algebra
overπ∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}hton inﬁnitely many generators, the ﬁrst of which is denoted σ2(vn).
The classσ2(vn)lives in degree 2pn. Finally, [ HW20 , Theorem 5.0.1] states that
there is an isomorphism π∗TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU)≃(π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU))[[/planck⋊ver2pi1]]
ofZp[v1,···,vn−1]-algebras. Moreover, under the map MUhS1→TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU),
the classvn∈π∗MUhS1∼=(π∗MU)[[/planck⋊ver2pi1]]is sent toσ2(vn)/planck⋊ver2pi1. In particular, π∗TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU)
detects the classes p,v1,···,vn−1,vn:=σ2(vn)/planck⋊ver2pi1. Similarly, π∗TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU)
detects the classes p,···,vnunder the map MUtS1→TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU), and
π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU)tZ/pdetects the classes p,···,vn−1under the map MUtZ/p→
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU)tZ/p.
Notation 2.2.3. IfRis a complex-oriented ring spectrum, we will write /planck⋊ver2pi1to
denote the complex orientation of R, viewed as a class in π−2RhS1. The motivation
for this notation comes from geometric representation theo ry (in the case where R
is aZp-algebra), where the complex orientation /planck⋊ver2pi1∈H2(CP∞;R)plays the role of
a quantization parameter.
The main result of this section is the following analogue of B ökstedt’s theorem
onTHH(Fp)andTHH(Zp).
Theorem 2.2.4. FixE3-forms of the truncated Brown-Peterson spectra BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht
andBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. We have:
(a) There is a p-complete equivalence of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-modules:
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[B∆n×ΩS2pn+1].
Writeθn∈π2pnTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))to denote the class correspond-
ing to the map E:S2pn→ΩS2pn+1. Under the S1-equivariant map
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU), the classθnis sent to
the classσ2(vn)from Recollection 2.2.2. There are also p-complete iso-
morphisms

Here, the equation θn/planck⋊ver2pi1=vnis to be understood modulo decomposables.
These isomorphisms satisfy the following property: under the maps
TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))→TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU),
TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))→TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU),
the classes {vi}0≤i≤non the left-hand side are sent to the eponymous
classes in the right-hand side (via Recollection 2.2.2).
(b) There is an equivalence of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-modules:
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))∧

In particular, there is an additive equivalence
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))/p∼=BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[S2pn+1−1×ΩS2pn+1+1×B∆n]/p.
Moreover,π2pn+1−3TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))∧
pdetects the class σn∈π2pn+1−3X(pn)
from[Dev23a , Lemma 3.1.12] .
Remark 2.2.5. Letv[j,m)denote the regular sequence vj,···,vm−1inπ∗BP. Then
the argument used to prove Theorem 2.2.4 in fact shows the fol lowing (somewhat
more general) result: for j≤n, there is an isomorphism of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗-modules

where|λi|= 2pi−1. Whenj= 0, (4) recovers [ ACH21 , Proposition 2.9]. For
brevity, the discussion below only includes the cases j=nandj=n−1. Similarly,
using thatT(1)(resp.T(2)(2)) is a Thom spectrum over ΩS2p+1(resp.ΩSp(2) ),
there are equivalences
THH(Zp)/p≃Fp[S2p−1×ΩS2p+1],
THH(ku)/(2,β)≃F2[Sp(2)×ΩS9].
Remark 2.2.6. If we write π∗MU =Z[x1,x2,···]where|xi|= 2i, and deﬁne
MU/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht= MU/(xn,xn+1,···), then one can similarly prove an analogue of
Theorem 2.2.4 with BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htreplaced by MU/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. Namely, if nis a power of
p, there is an equivalence
THH(MU /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(n))∧

p∼=π∗(MU/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1)∧
p.
We expect (see Conjecture 2.2.18 below) that this reﬁnes to a p-complete equiva-

p≃(MU/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1)∧

Example 2.2.7. One can make Theorem 2.2.4(a) very explicit for Zp(note that
Theorem 2.2.4(b) for Zpis Bökstedt’s result). For instance,
π∗TC−(Zp/T(1))∼=Zp[v1][[/planck⋊ver2pi1]][θ]/(/planck⋊ver2pi1θ=v1).
Let us view BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}htas(ku∧

Remark 2.2.8. Recall from [ Lur15 , Section 3.4] that there is an E2-monoidal
functorsh : Spgr→Spgrgiven by shearing: this functor sends M•/mapsto→M•[2•].
Assume for simplicity that T(n)admits the structure of an Efr
2-algebra. From this
perspective, part of Theorem 2.2.4(a) simply states that th ere is an equivalence of
ungraded BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-modules
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))≃sh(grvnBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht),
wheresh(grvnBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)denotes the shearing of the associated graded of the vn-adic
ﬁltration F⋆
vnBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htonBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht.
An immediate implication of Theorem 2.2.4 is the following.
Corollary 2.2.9 ([HW20 , Corollary 5.0.2]) .Fix anE3-form of the truncated
Brown-Peterson spectrum BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. We haveLK(n)K(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)/ne}ationslash= 0.
Proof. There is a trace map K(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)→TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht), which is a map
ofE2-rings. It therefore suﬃces to exhibit a nonzero module over LK(n)TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)
— but we may take the module LK(n)TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn)), which is nonzero by
Theorem 2.2.4(a). (In fact, Theorem 2.2.4(a) implies π∗LK(n)TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))
is isomorphic to Zp[v1,···,vn−1,v±1
n]∧
(p,···,vn−1)((/planck⋊ver2pi1))tensored with the Zp-homology
ofB∆n.) /square
Remark 2.2.10. It is easy to see that T(n)→BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htis a nilpotent extension.
This implies in particular that the following square is Cart esian by the Dundas-
Goodwillie-McCarthy theorem [ DGM13 , Theorem 7.2.2.1]:
K(T(n)) /d47/d47
/d15/d15K(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)
/d15/d15
TC(T(n)) /d47/d47TC(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht).
Note that there is also a commutative square
TC(T(n)) /d47/d47
/d15/d15TC(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)
/d15/d15
TC−(T(n)) /d47/d47TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht),16 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
and Theorem 2.2.4 and Theorem 3.1.4 give an inductive approa ch to calculating the
bottom row. One might therefore view the results of this arti cle as a ﬁrst step to
fully computing K(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht). It would be very interesting to describe TC(T(n)). For
example, we expect that for a general odd prime, the spectrum TP(T(1))is closely
related to the E1-quotientS/ /αp/p. (Here,αp/p∈π2p(p−1)−1(S)is an element in
theα-family.)
However, more is true about the map T(n)→BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht: in fact, every element
inker(π∗T(n)→π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)is nilpotent. To see this, ﬁrst observe that this map
is a rational equivalence (indeed, it is an equivalence on Q0-Margolis homology),
soﬁb(T(n)→BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)is torsion. Moreover, the map T(n)→BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htis surjective
on homotopy (since it is a ring map, and the generators p,v1,···,vn∈π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht
lift toT(n)), so that the map ﬁb(T(n)→BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)→T(n)induces an injection on
homotopy. If x∈π∗T(n)is in the image of the map ﬁb(T(n)→BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)→T(n),
then the image of xunder the Hurewicz map π∗T(n)→MU∗T(n)is also torsion;
butMU∗T(n)∼=MU∗[t1,···,tn]is torsion-free, so xmust be nilpotent by the main
theorem of [ DHS88 ]5. This is the desired claim.
More generally, recall [ Dev23a , Table 1], reproduced here as Table 1 (for the
deﬁnitions of these spectra, see [ Mah79 ] forA, where it is denoted X5; [Dev19 ,
Construction 3.1] and [ HM02 ] forB; [MRS01 ] fory(n); and [AQ19 ] foryZ(n)).

Table 1. The relation between RandΘ(R)is analogous to the
relationship between T(n)andBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht.
In a manner similar to above, if Ris anE1-ring as in the second line of Table 1,
andΘ(R)is the associated designer spectrum, one can show that every element in
ker(π∗R→π∗Θ(R))is nilpotent. It follows, for example, that there is a Cartes ian
square
K(R) /d47/d47
/d15/d15K(Θ(R))
/d15/d15
TC(R) /d47/d47TC(Θ(R)).
Moreover, the proof of Theorem 2.2.4 shows that were Rto admit the structure
of anE2-ring (which is generally not true6,THH(Θ(R)/R)would bep-completely
equivalent to R⊕/circleplustext
j≥1Σ2jpn+1−1R/pj (wherenis the “height” of R). IfR=y(n)
oryZ(n), this result is literally true by Theorem 2.2.4, as long as on e assumes
Conjecture 2.1.9 and interprets THH(Θ(R)/R)to meanTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))⊗T(n)R.
This does not cover the cases R=A,B, though; see Appendix A for further
discussion of these cases.
5In some sense, this is a rather perverse argument, because th e heart of the proof of the
nilpotence theorem relies crucially on showing that every e lement in ker(π∗T(n)→π∗BP/an}bracketle{tn/an}bracketri}ht)is
nilpotent.
6For instance, y(n)cannot admit the structure of an E2-ring, thanks to the Steinberger iden-
tity on the action of the Dyer-Lashof operation Q1on the dual Steenrod algebra (see [ BMMS86 ,
Theorems III.2.2 and III.2.3]).THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 17
Remark 2.2.11. It is natural to ask whether Theorem 2.2.4 can be generalized

statement that π∗THH(Fp/MU)≃Fp[BSU×ΩS3]∗.
Remark 2.2.12. Theorem 2.2.4(b) implies that
π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn−1))∼=BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[B∆n]∗⊕/circleplusdisplay

This can be compared to Theorem 2.2.4(a) (we will study in thi s in further de-
tail in Section 3): the complexity of π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn−1))compared to
π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))can be understood as arising via the descent spectral se-
quence for the map THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn−1))→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn)). Note
thatX(pn)⊗X(pn−1)X(pn)≃X(pn)[ΩS2pn−1]; using this, one can calculate using
methods similar to the proof of Theorem 2.2.4 that the E2-page of the descent
spectral sequence is

where|ǫ|= 2pn−1. Calculating the diﬀerentials gives an “alternative” proo f of
Theorem 2.2.4(b) given Theorem 2.2.4(a); we will expand on t his below in Re-
mark 2.2.17. In fact, inductively studying THH ofBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htrelative toX(pj)for

calculations of π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)in [AR05 , Section 8], [ MS93 ], and [ AHL10 ];
see Theorem 3.1.4 and Example 4.1.11.
The proof of Theorem 2.2.4 will be broken into several compon ents. Let us
begin by illustrating Theorem 2.2.4(a) in the case n= 0,1.
Proof of Theorem 2.2.4(a) for n= 0,1.We need to show that there are
equivalences of spectra THH(Fp)≃Fp[ΩS3]andTHH(Zp/X(p))≃Zp[BSU(p−
1)×ΩS2p+1]. The ﬁrst equivalence is classical (see [ Bö85 ]), so we argue the second
equivalence. There is a p-local map f: SU(p)→ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}htof spaces given by the
composite
SU(p)→SU(p)/SU(p−1)≃S2p−1α1−→ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht.
In [Dev23a , Remark 4.1.4], we described a ﬁber sequence (which was also known
to Toda in [ Tod62 ])
(5) S2p−1α1−→ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →ΩS2p+1.
This induces a ﬁber sequence of E1-spaces
ΩSU(p)f− →Ω2S3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →SU(p−1)×Ω2S2p+1.18 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
We now compute:
THH(Zp/X(p))≃THH(Zp)⊗THH(X(p))X(p)
≃THH(Zp)⊗Zp⊗THH(X(p))Zp.
The mapX(p)→Zpis precisely the map induced by f: ΩSU(p)→Ω2S3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht, so
the above tensor product is given by Zp[ΩS2p+1×BSU(p−1)], as desired. /square
Remark 2.2.13. Recall that the calculation THH(Fp)≃Fp[ΩS3]follows from
[BCS10 ] and the Hopkins-Mahowald theorem that Fpis the Thom spectrum of
theE2-mapΩ2S3→BGL1(S∧
p)which detects 1−p∈π1BGL1(S∧
p)∼=Z×
pon the
bottom cell of Ω2S3. In [Dev23a , Corollary B], we prove (unconditionally!) that
Zpis the Thom spectrum of a map µ: Ω2S2p+1→BGL1(T(1))which detects
v1∈π2p−1BGL1(T(1))∼=π2p−2T(1)on the bottom cell of Ω2S2p+1. (Unlike in the
classical Hopkins-Mahowald theorem, the map µis not an E2-map.) This result
implies that Zpis the Thom spectrum of a map SU(p−1)×Ω2S2p+1→BGL1(X(p)),
which can also be used to prove Theorem 2.2.4(a) for n= 1.
We now turn to Theorem 2.2.4(a) in the general case; the strat egy is to compute
the homology of each of the spectra under consideration, and run the Adams spec-
tral sequence. In the case of THHtZ/m,TC−, andTP, we will need the “continuous
homology” of [ BR05 , Equation 2.3].

Moreover, there is a Bockstein β:σ(ζn+2)/mapsto→σ(ζ2
n+1)forp= 2, and a
Bocksteinβ:σ(τn+1)/mapsto→σ(ζn+1)forp>2.
Proof. We begin by proving (a). We will use the Bökstedt spectral seq uence,
which runs

SinceH∗(X(pn);Fp)∼=H∗(T(n);Fp)⊗FpH∗(Ω∆n;Fp)and the action of H∗(X(pn);Fp)
onH∗(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;Fp)factors through the map H∗(X(pn);Fp)→H∗(T(n);Fp)
induced by the map crushing Ω∆nto a point, we will ignore the contribution
from∆nin this discussion. The ﬁnal contribution from these terms w ill only be
H∗(B∆n;Fp). (The following may therefore be interpreted as a computati on of
H∗(THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n));Fp); however, since Conjecture 2.1.9 is not known to
be true, the spectrum THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))cannot yet be deﬁned.) We will con-
tinue to write E2
∗,∗to denote the Hochschild homology groups of H∗(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;Fp)
overH∗(T(n);Fp).
Recall that if Ris any discrete commutative ring, there are isomorphisms

The map THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))induces a map from the
Bökstedt spectral sequence computing H∗(THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht))to our spectral se-
quence. The diﬀerentials in the Bökstedt spectral sequence computing H∗(THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht))
are calculated in [ AR05 , Proposition 5.6], where it is shown that for podd,j≥p,
andm≥n, there are diﬀerentials

The extensions on the E∞-page of the Bökstedt spectral sequence computing

that forj≥n+ 1, we have (σζj)2=σζj+1whenp= 2, and(στj)p=στj+1.
These imply extensions on the E∞-page of the Bökstedt spectral sequence for
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn)), and the resulting answer is that of the proposition.
We now turn to (b). The calculation is similar to (a), the only diﬀerence being

the calculation for Hc

and the image of σin ﬁltration zero (these classes being simple /planck⋊ver2pi1-torsion). We claim
that the spectral sequence degenerates at the E3-page, which then implies the de-
sired result. (In the case of THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))tZ/p, for instance, the class
ǫ1/planck⋊ver2pi11−pnplays the role of τninHc

As with the proof of Proposition 2.2.14, this follows from [ BR05 , Proposition
6.1]: were there any diﬀerentials in the homological homoto py ﬁxed points spectral
sequence for H∗(TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn));Fp), there would also exist correspond-
ing diﬀerentials in the homological homotopy ﬁxed points sp ectral sequence for
H∗(TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht);Fp).
However, the statement of [ BR05 , Proposition 6.1] assumes that BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht
admits the structure of an E∞-algebra; this is not necessary, since their appeal to
[BR05 , Proposition 5.1] only uses the existence of the Dyer-Lasho f operations Q0
andQ1onH∗(THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht);Fp), which already exist in the homology of any
E2-algebra. It therefore suﬃces to know that THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)admits the structure
of anE2-algebra, which is a consequence of our assumption that BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htis an
E3-form of the truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum. /square
Proof of Theorem 2.2.4(a). We will ignore the contribution from B∆nbe-
low: the contribution from this term is simply its homology. We will ﬁrst calculate

SinceTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))≃THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)⊗THH(X(pn))X(pn), we see that
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))admits the structure of a THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)-module. There
is anE2-mapBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht), so that THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))ac-
quires the structure of a BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-module by restriction of scalars. Therefore, each
of theBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗-module generators of π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))lift to maps of
spectra from shifts of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httoTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn)). Moreover, the re-
sulting map BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[B∆n×ΩS2pn+1]→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))induces an
isomorphism on homotopy by construction, so we obtain the ﬁr st part of Theo-
rem 2.2.4(a).
The calculation for π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))tZ/mis similar to the calculation

illustrative to calculate π∗TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn)), since the case of π∗TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))
will just involve bookkeeping of the /planck⋊ver2pi1-torsion terms in Proposition 2.2.15. There is

which is in general only conditionally convergent, but is st rongly convergent in this
case. (This is because H∗(THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn));Fp)is bounded-below and of

so that the Adams spectral sequence is concentrated in even t otal degree (and
therefore degenerates at the E2-page); this gives the desired calculation. /square
Remark 2.2.16. The homotopy ﬁxed points spectral sequence for π∗TC−(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))
hasE2-page given by
E∗,∗
2= BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[B∆n]∗[θn][[/planck⋊ver2pi1]].
By evenness, this spectral sequence degenerates at the E2-page. The calculation of
Theorem 2.2.4(a) tells us that the class /planck⋊ver2pi1θnon theE∞-page represents the class
vn∈π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht(modulo decomposables).
Note that Theorem 2.2.4(a) says in particular that π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))tZ/p∼=
π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/p[B∆n]. There is an isomorphism π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/p∼=π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1(which
was proved in [ AMS98 , Proposition 2.3], and conjectured to lift to an equivalenc e
of spectra in [ DJK+86, Conjecture 1.2]), so that π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))tZ/p∼=
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[B∆n]∗((/planck⋊ver2pi1)). Note that unless n= 0, this is notisomorphic to π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))[θ−1

sinceπ∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))[θ−1

is2-periodic.
Proof of Theorem 2.2.4(b). We now calculate π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn)), this
time with the use of Bockstein spectral sequences. (Similar arguments can be found
in [ACH21 ].) Again, we will ignore the contribution from B∆nbelow: the contri-
bution from this term is simply its homology. For simplicity , let us write
x=/braceleftBigg

so that|x|= 2pn+1−1and|y|= 2pn+1. IfMis a (left) BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-module, let
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);M)denoteTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))⊗BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ightM, so that we may in-
formally view THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp)asTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))/(p,···,vn). Using
Proposition 2.2.14(b), one can show that
π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp)∼=Fp[x,y]/x2;
we will compute THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)using this calculation and n+1Bock-
stein spectral sequences. The v0-Bockstein spectral sequence is given by
(7)
E∗,∗
1=π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp)[v0]∼=Fp[v0,x,y]/x2⇒π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Zp).
It follows from the Bockstein calculation in Proposition 2. 2.14(b) that there is a
d1-diﬀerential
(8) d1(y) =v0x,
which implies d1(yvn
0) =vn+1
0x(byFp[v0]-linearity). However, (8) does not imme-
diately imply diﬀerentials on powers of y, sinceTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))does not admit
the structure of a ring (so the spectral sequence is not multi plicative). However,
this is easily resolved: there is a map to the above Bockstein spectral sequence from
the Bockstein spectral sequence computing π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;Zp), whoseE1-page is
′E∗,∗
1∼=π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;Fp)[v0].
The calculation of H∗(THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht);Fp)is described in [ AR05 , Theorem 5.12];
from this, one can compute π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;Fp). Here, we will only need to observe
that the classes x,y∈E∗,∗
1lift along the map′E∗,∗
1→E∗,∗
1. We will continue
to denote these lifts by xandy; there is still a d1-diﬀerential d1(y) =v0xin
′E∗,∗
1. SinceTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;Zp)admits the structure of an E2-ring, the above spectral
sequence is multiplicative. Therefore, we may appeal to [ May70 , Proposition 6.8],
which gives higher diﬀerentials on powers of y. In particular, we claim:
(9) dvp(j)+1(yj) =vvp(j)+1
0xyj−1,
up to a unit in F×
p. By taking base- pexpansions, it suﬃces to prove this diﬀerential
whenjis a power of p, sayj=pk: then, (9) says that dk+1(ypk) =vk+1
0xypk−1.
Using [ May70 , Proposition 6.8] for k>1, we have
dk+1((ypk−1)p) =v0(ypk−1)p−1dk(ypk−1) =v0ypk−pk−1dk(ypk−1);
this inductively implies (9) once we establish the case k= 1.
Forp= 2, [May70 , Proposition 6.8] says that
d2(y2) =v0yd1(y)+Q1(d1(y)) =v2
0xy2+Q1(v0x).
But
Q1(x) =Q1(σ(ζ2
n+1)) =σ(Q2(ζ2
n+1)) =σ(ζ2
n+2),
which is zero. Therefore, we see that d2(y2) =v0xy2, as desired. For p >2,
[May70 , Proposition 6.8] says that
d2(yp) =v0yp−1d1(y)+/summationdisplay
1≤j≤rj[d1(y)yj−1,d1(y)yp−j−1],
for some integer r. The “correction” term is a v0-multiple of sum of terms of
the form [xyj−1,xyp−j−1]. Note that this class lives in π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;Fp), but
for the calculation of (7), we are only concerned with the ima ge of this classTHH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 23
inπ∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp). We claim that the image of [xyj−1,xyp−j−1]in
π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp)vanishes, so the correction terms above vanish. To prove
this, observe that the Leibniz rule implies that, in π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;Fp), we have
[xyj−1,xyp−j−1] =x[yj−1,xyp−j−1]+yj−1[x,xyp−j−1]
=x2[yj−1,yp−j−1]+xyp−j−1[yj−1,x]+yp−2[x,x]+xyj−1[x,yp−j−1].
Here, all terms are written up to sign; this will not matter, s ince we will show that
each of the terms in the sum above vanish. The ﬁrst term vanish es sincex2= 0,
and the third term vanishes since [x,x] = 0. For the second and fourth term, we
will argue more generally that the image of [x,yk]inπ∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp)
vanishes for any k≥0. The Leibniz rule implies that [x,yk] =kyk−1[x,y], so it
suﬃces to show that the image of [x,y]inπ∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp)vanishes.
Since[x,y]lives in degree |x|+|y|+1 = (2pn+1−1)+2pn+1+1 = 4pn+1and
π4pn+1THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp)∼=Fp{y2}, we must have [x,y] ˙ =y2inπ∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp)
if[x,y]is nonzero. To show that [x,y]˙/ne}ationslash=y2, we observe that the E2-mapι:
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;Fp)→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/MU;Fp)factors through THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp).
The classes xandyare in the image of the map THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;Fp)→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp),
andxis killed by the map ι. Sinceιis anE2-map, we must have ι([x,y]) =
[ι(x),ι(y)] = 0 ; however,ι(y2) =ι(y)2is nonzero. Therefore, [x,y]˙/ne}ationslash=y2; but since
π4pn+1THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Fp)is a1-dimensional Fp-vector space spanned by y2,
we must have [x,y] = 0.
The upshot of this discussion is that the Er-page of (7) is given by
E∗,∗
r=Fp[v0,ypr−1]{1,x,xy,xy2,···}/(vi
0xypi−1j−1,1≤i≤r−1,1≤j≤p−1).
In particular, no power of ysurvives to the E∞-page, and since v0representsp, we
can resolve the v0-extensions to conclude that
(10) π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn);Zp)∼=Zp⊕/circleplusdisplay
j≥1Zp/pvp(j)+1{xyj−1}.
Note that |xyj−1|= 2jpn+1−1.
The higher Bockstein spectral sequences (for v1,···,vn) all collapse at the E1-
page for degree reasons, as we now explain. For the vm-Bockstein spectral sequence
with1≤m≤n, one can argue by induction on m(the base case is the same ar-
gument as the inductive step). First, observe that v1,···,vnsurvive the Bockstein
spectral sequence, since BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htsplits oﬀ THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn)). In particular, there
cannot be any diﬀerential with target given by a product of mo nomials in the vis.
ByZp[v1,···,vm]-linearity, any diﬀerential must therefore be of the form
dr(xyj−1) =vr1
i1···vra
iavr
mxyk−1
for somej,k, exponents r1,···,ra, and1≤i1,···,ia<m. (More precisely, it will
be a sum of monomials of the above form, but this point will not matter.) But
dr(xyj−1)has bidegree (t−s,s) = (2jpn+1−2,r), whilevr1

mxyk−1has
bidegree (t−s,s) = (2r1(pi1−1) +···+ 2ra(pia−1) + 2r(pm−1) + 2kpn+1−
1,r). Such a diﬀerential is therefore not possible, since 2jpn+1−2is even, while
2r1(pi1−1)+···+2ra(pia−1)+2r(pm−1)+2kpn+1−1is odd. The calculation
ofπ∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))now follows from (10).
SinceTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))≃THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)⊗THH(X(pn))X(pn), we see that
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))admits the structure of a THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)-module. There is an24 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR

ture of a BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-module by restriction of scalars. Therefore, each of the BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗-
module generators of π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))lift to maps of spectra from shifts

Remark 2.2.17. Whenn= 0, one may view the Bockstein calculation of Theo-
rem 2.2.4(b) as a translation of the Serre spectral sequence for the ﬁbration (5).
Assume that p>2. Indeed, the Serre spectral sequence is given by
E2

There is a single family of diﬀerentials, determined multip licatively from
d2p(y) =px;
this implies that d2p(ym) =mpym−1x. The Serre spectral sequence collapses at the
E2p+1-page, and the resulting answer is precisely (10). In fact, i fφn: Ω2S2pn+1→
S2pn−1is a charming map in the sense of [ Dev23a , Deﬁnition 4.1.1] (such as the
Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer map of [ CMN79a, CMN79b, Nei81 ]), the proof of
Theorem 2.2.4(b) can be understood as a calculation of π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[Bﬁb(φn)]
using the Serre spectral sequence for the Cohen-Moore-Neis endorfer type ﬁbration
(11) S2pn−1→Bﬁb(φn)→ΩS2pn+1.
The Serre spectral sequence for (11) is exactly the same as th at of (5): the E2-page

d2pn(y) =px;
this implies that d2pn(ym) =mpym−1x, and the Serre spectral sequence collapses

In fact, Theorem 2.2.4(b) implies that there is an equivalen ce ofBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-modules

The calculations of Theorem 2.2.4 can be predicted from the r esults of [ Dev23a ].
Let us suppose that pis odd for simplicity. Assuming [ Dev23a , Conjectures D and
E], [Dev23a , Corollary B] implies that there is a map Ω2S2pn+1→BGL1(X(pn))
whose Thom spectrum is BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[Ω∆n]. This implies that there is an equivalence

the ﬁrst part of Theorem 2.2.4(a). Moreover, [ Dev23a , Theorem A] says (still
assuming the aforementioned conjectures) that the Thom spe ctrum of the com-
positeﬁb(φn)→Ω2S2pn+1→BGL1(X(pn))isBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[Ω∆n]. This can be shown

BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. ThenTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))admits the structure of an S1-equivariant
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-module (where S1acts trivially on BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht), and the equivalences of Theo-
rem 2.2.4(a) reﬁne to p-complete equivalences of spectra
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))tZ/m≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/m[B∆n],
TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1[B∆n].
The ﬁrst equivalence is S1-equivariant for the residual S1/µm-action on THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))tZ/m
andBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/m.
Remark 2.2.19. The primary diﬃculty with proving Conjecture 2.2.18 is that it
is not clear how to endow TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))orTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))tZ/m
with the structure of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-modules. Nevertheless, a small part of the ﬁnal equiv-
alence in Conjecture 2.2.18 can be proved unconditionally w henn= 1. Namely,
there is a map TP(Zp/X(p))→/circleplustext
j>−(p−1)Σ2jBP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}htwhich induces the inclusion of
summands on mod pcohomology. (This is the “easy” range, since the ﬁrst predic ted
summand of TP(Zp/X(p))which is not covered by this claim is Σ−2(p−1)BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;
butπ0of this spectrum this is exactly where the class v1lives.) We computed
the modphomology of TP(Zp/X(p))in Proposition 2.2.15. This implies that
H∗,c(TP(Zp/X(p));Fp)∼=H∗(BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht;Fp)((/planck⋊ver2pi1))⊗FpH∗(BSU(p−1);Fp). There is an
Adams spectral sequence
Exts,t+2j
A∗(A/ /E(1),A/ /E(1))((/planck⋊ver2pi1))⊗FpH∗(BSU(p−1);Fp)⇒π0Map(TP( Zp/X(p)),Σ2jBP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)∧
p.
We wish to show that for j >−(p−1), any class in bidegree (s,t−s) = (0,2j)
survives to the E∞-page. For this, it suﬃces to show that there can be no nonzero
dr-diﬀerential oﬀ this class for r≥2. This diﬀerential would necessarily land
in(r,2j−1). By [ AP76 , Proposition 4.1], Exts,t
A∗(A/ /E(1),A/ /E(1))vanishes
fors≥1,t−sodd, andt−s≥ −2(p−1). In particular, we see that taking
(s,t−s) = (r,2j−1), we have 2j−1≥ −2(p−1)precisely when j >−(p−1).
Therefore, we get a map TP(Zp/X(p))→Σ2jBP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}htfor everyj >−(p−1), which
gives the desired claim.
2.3. Variant: THHover a deeper base. In Theorem 2.2.4, we saw a “poly-
nomial” generator in degree 2pn, wherenis the height. When n= 0, this reduces
the Bökstedt generator in degree 2; we will now discuss a variant of Theorem 2.2.4
whenn= 1, where one obtains a generator in degree 2.
Construction 2.3.1. LetU(1)→SU(p)denote the inclusion given by the homo-
morphism
λ/mapsto→diag(λ,···,λ,λ1−p).
There is an induced map BU(1)→BSU(p), which deﬁnes an E2-mapΩU(1)≃
Z→ΩSU(p). LetJ(p)denote the Thom spectrum of the composite E2-map
µ: ΩU(1) →ΩSU(p)→ΩSU≃BU. ThenJ(p)admits an Efr
2-structure by
Proposition 2.1.11 such that there is an Efr
2-algebra map J(p)→X(p). Note that
the underlying E1-map ofµis null, since Bµ:S1→B2U≃SUis a class in
π1(SU) = 0 . Therefore, the underlying E1-ring ofJ(p)isS[Z] =S[t±1]. Moreover,26 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
the underlying E1-map ofJ(p)→X(p)→Zpis the map S[t±1]→Zpsending
t/mapsto→1.
Proposition 2.3.2. There is an equivalence THH(T(1)/J(p))≃T(1)[Jp−1(S2)].
Similarly, THH(X(p)/J(p))≃X(p)[Jp−1(S2)×SU(p−1)].
Proof. Indeed,THH(T(1)/J(p))≃THH(T(1))⊗THH(J(p))J(p)is equivalent
toT(1)[S2p−1]⊗T(1)[S1]T(1); but there is a ﬁber sequence
S1→S2p−1→S2p−1/S1=CPp−1≃Jp−1(S2),
from which the desired claim follows. /square
Proposition 2.3.3. The following statements are true:
(a) There is an equivalence THH(Zp/J(p))≃Zp[ΩS3]. In particular, π∗THH(Zp/J(p))∼=
Zp[x]with|x|= 2. On homotopy, the map THH(Zp/J(p))→THH(Zp/X(p))
is given by
xj/mapsto→/braceleftBigg
θj/pj∈pZ,
0 else.
(b) The canonical map THH(Zp/J(p))→THH(Fp/J(p))factors through the
unitTHH(Fp)→THH(Fp/J(p)), and deﬁnes an equivalence Fp⊗Zp
THH(Zp/J(p))∼− →THH(Fp)ofTHH(Zp)-modules.
Proof. For part (a), we begin by observing that there is an equivalen ce
THH(Zp/J(p))≃THH(Zp)⊗THH(J(p))J(p)≃Zp[ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht]⊗Zp[U(1)]Zp.
The map Zp⊗J(p)THH(J(p))→THH(Zp)factors through Zp⊗X(p)THH(X(p))→
THH(Zp), and can be identiﬁed with Zp-chains of the composite
U(1)→SU(p)→S2p−1α1−→ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht.
Note that the map U(1)→S2p−1is the ﬁber of the map S2p−1→CPp−1. This
composite can be identiﬁed with action of S1onΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. Since there is a ﬁber
sequence
S1→ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →ΩS3,
we see that THH(Zp/J(p))≃Zp[ΩS3]. To identify the map THH(Zp/J(p))→
THH(Zp/X(p)), observe that CPp−1≃Jp−1(S2)and that there is a square where
each row and column is a ﬁber sequence:
Ω(SU(p−1)×CPp−1)≃ΩSU(p)/S1 /d47/d47

The eﬀect of the map THH(Zp/J(p))→THH(Zp/X(p))is dictated by the bottom-
right vertical map, which is induced by the James-Hopf map Hp: ΩS3→ΩS2p+1.
OnZp-homology, the eﬀect of the James-Hopf map is as stated in Pro position 2.3.3(a).
For part (b), there is an equivalence
THH(Fp/J(p))≃THH(Fp)⊗THH(J(p))J(p)≃Fp[ΩS3]⊗Fp[U(1)]Fp.THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 27
However, the map Fp⊗J(p)THH(J(p))→THH(Fp)factors through Fp⊗ZpTHH(Zp)→
THH(Fp), and can be identiﬁed with Fp-chains of the composite of U(1)→ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht
with the canonical map ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →ΩS3. This composite is null as an E1-map (in
fact, as an E2-map), since there is a ﬁber sequence of E1-spaces
BU(1)≃CP∞→S3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →S3.
Therefore, we see that
THH(Fp/J(p))≃Fp[ΩS3]⊗Fp(Fp⊗Fp[U(1)]Fp)≃Fp[ΩS3×CP∞].
This implies that the map THH(Zp/J(p))→THH(Fp/J(p))factors through THH(Fp)→
THH(Fp/J(p)). In turn, we obtain a map Fp⊗ZpTHH(Zp/J(p))→THH(Fp)
which sends the generators in π∗(Fp⊗ZpTHH(Zp/J(p)))∼=Fp[x]to the generators
inπ∗THH(Fp)∼=Fp[σ]. Therefore, the map Fp⊗ZpTHH(Zp/J(p))→THH(Fp)
is an equivalence, as desired. /square
Remark 2.3.4. The mapJ(p)→X(p)induces a map u: THH(Zp/J(p))→
THH(Zp/X(p)). Under Theorem 2.2.4 and Proposition 2.3.3, the map ucan be
identiﬁed with the Zp-chains of the composite
ΩS3→ΩS2p+1→ΩS2p+1×BSU(p−1);
here, the map ΩS3→ΩS2p+1is the Hopf map. This claim follows from the proof
of Proposition 2.3.3, Proposition 2.3.2, and the EHP ﬁbrati on
Jp−1(S2)→ΩS3→ΩS2p+1.
In particular, the map uinduces the map Zp[x]→Zp[θ]⊗ZpZp[BSU(p−1)]which
sendsxm/mapsto→θm/pifp|mandxm/mapsto→0otherwise.
Note that if T(1)were anEfr
2-algebra, the map uwould factor through THH(Zp/J(p))→
THH(Zp/T(1)); and under the equivalences of Theorem 2.2.4 and Propositio n 2.3.3,
this would identify with the Zp-chains of the Hopf map.
Remark 2.3.5. Proposition 2.3.3 demonstrates the dependence of THH(R′/R)
on theE1-R-algebra structure on R′. Indeed, recall that the underlying E1-map
of theE2-mapJ(p)→X(p)→Zpis the map S[t±1]→Zpsendingt/mapsto→1.
Proposition 2.3.3 states that THH(Zp/J(p))≃Zp[ΩS3]. However, suppose that
S[t±1] =S[Z]is equipped with its standard E2-structure, and Zpis viewed as
anE1-S[Z]-algebra via the composite S[Z]→S→Zp. ThenTHH(Zp/S[Z])≃
THH(Zp)⊗S[CP∞]≃Zp[ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht×CP∞]. SinceZp[ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht×CP∞]/ne}ationslash≃Zp[ΩS3],
we conclude that THH(Zp/S[Z])/ne}ationslash≃THH(Zp/J(p)).
Corollary 2.3.6. There is an isomorphism π∗TP(Zp/J(p))≃Zp[t±1]∧
(t−1)((/planck⋊ver2pi1))
with|/planck⋊ver2pi1|=−2.
Corollary 2.3.7. IfCis aZp-linear∞-category, there is a (non- S1-equivariant)
equivalence THH( C/J(p))⊗ZpFp≃THH( C⊗ZpFp).
Proof. By Proposition 2.3.3(b), there is an equivalence THH(Zp/J(p))⊗Zp
Fp≃THH(Fp)ofTHH(Zp)-modules. It follows that
THH( C/J(p))⊗ZpFp≃THH( C)⊗THH(Zp)THH(Zp/J(p))⊗ZpFp
∼− →THH( C)⊗THH(Zp)THH(Fp)≃THH( C⊗ZpFp),
as desired. /square28 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Remark 2.3.8. Recall from [ AMN18 , Theorem 3.5] that if S[z] =S[Z≥0]de-
notes the ﬂat polynomial ring on a class in degree 0, then there is an isomorphism
π∗THH(Zp/S[z])∼=Zp[σ2(z−p)], where the E∞-mapS[z]→Zpsendsz/mapsto→p. This
implies that π∗TP(Zp/S[z])∼=Zp[z]∧
(z−p)((/planck⋊ver2pi1)). Similarly, there is an isomorphism
π∗TP(Zp/S[[/tildewidep]])∼=Zp[[/tildewidep]]∧

In the same way, there is an isomorphism π∗THH(Zp/S[t±1])∼=Zp[σ2(t+
p−1)], where the E∞-mapS[t±1]→Zpsendst/mapsto→1−p. This implies that
π∗TP(Zp/S[t±1])∼=Zp[t±1]∧
(t+p−1)((/planck⋊ver2pi1)). In light of the obvious analogy to Proposi-
tion 2.3.3 and Corollary 2.3.6, it is natural to ask: what is t he role ofJ(p)?
To answer this, let us assume for simplicity that T(1)admits the structure of
anE2-ring. The main utility of J(p)is that it admits, by construction, a direct
comparison to T(1); one can view J(p)as containing roughly the same “height 1”
information as T(1). On the other hand, we do not know how to directly compare
S[t±1](with the standard E2-structure) to T(1). (Both admit E1-algebra maps to
T(1)[t±1], but this is somewhat unsatisfactory.) One can therefore vi ew Construc-
tion 2.3.1 as an explicit modiﬁcation of the E2-structure on S[t±1]such that the
resulting E2-algebra admits an interesting map to T(1).
It is natural to ask if Proposition 2.3.3 admits a generaliza tion toBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht.
At height 1andp= 2, we can explicitly construct some Efr
2-rings which give higher
analogues of J(p), but a general construction at higher heights and other prim es
eludes us.
Construction 2.3.9. Recall from Remark 2.1.10 that there is an E2-mapΩSp(2)→
BUwhose Thom spectrum is equivalent to T(2)atp= 2. LetT2(2)denote the
Efr
2-ring deﬁned as the Thom spectrum of the composite E2-map
ΩSpin(4) →ΩSp(2)→BU,
where the ﬁrst map is induced by the inclusion Spin(4)⊆Spin(5)∼=Sp(2). Simi-
larly, letT4(2)denote the Efr
2-ring deﬁned as the Thom spectrum of the composite
E2-map
ΩU(2)→ΩSp(2)→BU,
where the ﬁrst map is induced by the inclusion U(2)⊆Sp(2). Note that this
inclusion factors as U(2)→Spin(4)→Sp(2), so that there is a composite map of
Efr
2-rings
T4(2)→T2(2)→T(2).
Remark 2.3.10. There is a ﬁber sequence
ΩS3→ΩSpin(4) →ΩS3,
which implies that MU∗(T2(2))≃MU∗[t1,x2]where|x2|= 2. Similarly, there is a
ﬁber sequence
ΩS3→ΩU(2)→ΩS1≃Z,
which implies that MU∗(T4(2))≃MU∗[t1,x±1
0]where|x0|= 0.
Lemma 2.3.11. There is a diﬀeomorphism Sp(2)/Spin(4) ∼=S4, as well as a
homotopy equivalence Sp(2)/U(2)≃J3(S2).THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 29
Proof. The ﬁrst diﬀeomorphism follows immediately from the isomor phism
Sp(2)∼=Spin(5) and the resulting chain
Sp(2)/Spin(4)∼=Spin(5)/Spin(4)∼=SO(5)/SO(4)∼=S4.
To prove the second equivalence, the key input is [ Ame18 , Proposition 4.3], which
says that there is a ﬁber sequence
V2(R5)→J3(S2)→CP∞;
in other words, there is an S1-action on the Stiefel manifold V2(R5)such that
V2(R5)/S1∼=J3(S2). Recall that V2(R5)is diﬀeomorphic to SO(5)/SO(3)∼=
Spin(5)/SU(2) . It is not diﬃcult to see that the claimed S1-action on V2(R5)
via the above ﬁber sequence is precisely the residual action ofU(2)/SU(2)∼=S1
onSpin(5)/SU(2) ; in particular, we may identify J3(S2)≃Spin(5)/U(2), as de-
sired. /square
Remark 2.3.12. The quotient Sp(2)/U(2) is also known as the complex La-
grangian Grassmannian GrLag
2(T∗C2)of Lagrangian subspaces of T∗C2.
Warning 2.3.13. One should not confuse Sp(2)/U(2)with the quotient Sp(2)/(Sp(1)×
U(1)): indeed, Lemma 2.3.11 says that the former is homotopy equiv alent toJ3(S2),
while the latter is diﬀeomorphic to S7/U(1) =CP3. These spaces are not homotopy
equivalent (although they do become equivalent after inver ting6).
Lemma 2.3.11 has the following amusing (inconsequential?) consequence:
Corollary 2.3.14. LetQ⊆CP4be a complex quadric, and let Gr+
2(R5)denote
the Grassmannian of oriented 2-planes in R5. Then, there are diﬀeomorphisms
Q∼=GrLag
2(T∗C2)∼=Gr+
2(R5), and these are homotopy equivalent to J3(S2).
Proof. SinceSp(2)/U(2)∼=SO(5)/(SO(3)·SO(2)) , we can identify Sp(2)/U(2) =
GrLag
2(T∗C2)withGr+
2(R5). Therefore, Lemma 2.3.11 gives a homotopy equiva-
lenceGr+
2(R5)≃J3(S2). The desired claim now follows from the observation
thatGr+
2(R5)is diﬀeomorphic to a quadric Q⊆CP4via the map Gr+
2(R5)→
Gr1(C5)∼=CP4induced by the isomorphism R10∼− →C5; see [KN96 , Example
10.6, Page 280]. /square
Remark 2.3.15. There is a ﬁbration7(see (57) for a more general statement)
(12) S2→J3(S2)→S4,
which, under the diﬀeomorphism
Spin(4)/U(2)∼=(SU(2)×SU(2))/U(2)∼=SU(2)/U(1)∼=S2,
can be identiﬁed via Lemma 2.3.11 with the ﬁbration
Spin(4)/U(2)→Sp(2)/U(2)→Sp(2)/Spin(4).
7The ﬁbration (12) is analogous to the “twistor” ﬁbration (se e (62))S2→CP3→S4.30 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR

the rightmost vertical ﬁber sequence is the Hopf ﬁbration. T his diagram captures
the relationships between J(2),T4(2),T(1), andT(2).
Remark 2.3.16. The equivalence Sp(2)/U(2) = GrLag
2(T∗C2)≃J3(S2)of Lemma 2.3.11
can be used to understand the relationship between T(2)and the Mahowald-
Ravenel-Shick spectrum y(2)from [MRS01 ] (at the prime 2).8Recall from Re-
mark 2.1.10 that there is an E2-mapΩSp(2)→BUwhose Thom spectrum is
equivalent to T(2)atp= 2. Similarly, recall that y(2)is the Thom spectrum
of the bundle determined by the map µ: ΩJ3(S2)→Ω2S3→BO, where the
second map is the extension of the Möbius bundle S1→BO. Under the equiva-
lenceSp(2)/U(2)≃Sp/U, the mapµ: ΩJ3(S2)→BOcan be identiﬁed with the
composite
Ω(Sp(2)/U(2))→Ω(Sp/U)→B2Oη− →BO;
the middle map is obtained via Bott periodicity. Applying [ Dev23a , Proposition
2.1.6] to loops on the ﬁbration
Sp(2)→J3(S2)→BU(2),
we conclude that y(2) = ΩJ3(S2)µis equivalent as an E1-ring to the Thom spectrum
of anE1-mapU(2)→BGL1(T(2)). This implies, for instance, that THH(y(2)/T(2))≃
y(2)[BU(2)] . Sincek(2)≃y(2)⊗T(2)BP/an}b∇acketle{t2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht, this implies that THH(k(2)/BP/an}b∇acketle{t2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)≃
k(2)[BU(2)] . Similarly, since y(2)⊗T(2)ku≃F2, we also recover the observa-
tion that F2is equivalent as an E1-ring to the Thom spectrum of an E1-map
U(2)→BGL1(ku), and hence that HH(F2/ku)≃F2[BU(2)] asF2-modules.
Proposition 2.3.17. There is an equivalence THH(T(2)/T2(2))≃T(2)[S4], as
well as an equivalence THH(T(2)/T4(2))≃T(2)[J3(S2)].
Proof. Note thatηis nullhomotopic in T4(2)(and hence in T2(2)), since the
inclusion SU(2)→U(2)deﬁnes a map S2→ΩU(2) , which in turn Thomiﬁes to
8A simpler version of this discussion simply states that if ΩS2→BOis the map extending
the Möbius bundle S1→BO, then [ Dev23a , Proposition 2.1.6] along with loops on the ﬁbration
S3η− →S2→CP∞
implies that there is a map S1→BGL1(T(1))whose Thom spectrum is the E1-quotient S/ /2 =
y(1). The map S1→BGL1(T(1))detects1−2∈π0(T(1))×on the bottom cell of the source, so we
recover the fact that T(1)/2≃y(1). In particular, HH(y(1)/T(1))≃y(1)[CP∞]. Sincey(1)⊗T(1)
Z2≃F2, this recovers the well-known observation that HH(F2/Z2)≃F2[CP∞], at least as
modules overF2. This argument does not give the F2-algebra structure, since HH(y(1)/T(1))is
not a ring.THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 31

which by [ Dev23a , Proposition 2.1.6] (see also [ Bea17 ]) imply that T(2)is a Thom
spectrum of an E1-mapΩS4→BGL1(T2(2))(resp.ΩJ3(S2)→BGL1(T4(2))).
Together with [ BCS10 ], this implies the desired claim. /square
Remark 2.3.18. Recall that SU(4)/Sp(2)∼=S5. It follows that THH(X(4)/T(2))≃
X(4)[S5]. Similarly, recall that SU(4)∼=Spin(6) ; therefore, there is an diﬀeomor-
phism
SU(4)/Spin(4)∼=Spin(6)/Spin(4)∼=SO(6)/SO(4)∼=V2(R6).
It follows that THH(X(4)/T2(2))≃X(4)[V2(R6)]. (Note also that SU(4)/Spin(4)∼=
SU(4)/(SU(2)×SU(2)) can be viewed as an “oriented complex Grassmannian”
/tildewiderGr2(C4).) Finally, THH(X(4)/T2(2))≃X(4)[SU(4)/U(2)].
Corollary 2.3.19. There are 2-complete equivalences of ku-modules
THH(ku/T2(2))≃ku[ΩS5],
THH(ku/T4(2))≃ku[ΩS3].
Under these equivalences, the maps
THH(ku/T4(2))→THH(ku/T2(2))→THH(ku/T(2))
are induced by taking ku-chains of the Hopf maps
ΩS3H− →ΩS5H− →ΩS9.
Proof. Using Proposition 2.3.17, this follows from Theorem 2.2.4( a) (more
precisely, the version with p= 2andn= 2forTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(2))≃ku[ΩS9]), and

ﬁcation of the maps THH(ku/T4(2))→THH(ku/T2(2))andTHH(ku/T2(2))→
THH(ku/T(2))is an immediate consequence. /square
Remark 2.3.20. Recall from Theorem 2.2.4(a) that the generator θ2∈π8THH(ku/T(2))
can be understood as σ2(v2)(up to decomposables). Taking THH relative to the
Thom spectrum T2(2)overΩSpin(4) can be regarded as extracting a square root of
θ2∈π8THH(ku/T(2)). Similarly, taking THHrelative to the Thom spectrum T4(2)
overΩU(2) can be regarded as extracting a fourth root of θ2∈π8THH(ku/T(2));
hence the subscript 4. (Roughly, the generator of π4THH(ku/T2(2))can be thought
of asσ2(v1); and the generator of π2THH(ku/T4(2))can be thought of as σ2(2).)
In particular, one should regard T4(2) = (ΩU(2))µas the appropriate analogue of
J(p)at height 1andp= 2.32 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Remark 2.3.21. Corollary 2.3.19 suggests that ku∧
2is equivalent to the Thom
spectrum of an E1-mapΩ2S3→BGL1(T4(2)). This could also be rephrased in a
manner similar to the results of [ Dev23a ]: assuming [ Dev23a , Conjectures D and
E], [Dev23a , Corollary B] says that ku∧
2is the Thom spectrum of a map Ω2S9→
BGL1(T(2)). It follows from Proposition 2.3.17 that T(2)≃colimΩJ3(S2)T4(2), so
that [Dev23a , Corollary B] implies
ku∧
2≃colimΩ2S9T(2)≃colimΩ2S9colimΩJ3(S2)T4(2)≃colimΩ2S3T4(2),
where the ﬁnal equivalence comes from the E1-equivalence colimΩ2S9ΩJ3(S2)≃
Ω2S3arising from the EHP sequence.
This leads to the following, which we only state for T(n); there is an analogue
forX(pn), too.
Conjecture 2.3.22. Fix a prime pandn≥0. For each 0≤j≤n, there are
Efr
2-ringsTpj(n)equipped with Efr
2-maps
Tpn(n)→ ··· →Tpj(n)→Tpj−1(n)→ ··· →T0(n) =T(n)
such that there are p-complete equivalences
THH(T(n)/Tpj(n))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[Jpj−1(S2pn−j)],
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/Tpj(n))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[ΩS2pn−j+1].
The map THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/Tpj(n))→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/Tpj−1(n))induced by the
Efr
2-mapTpj(n)→Tpj−1(n)is given by BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-chains on the Hopf map ΩS2pn−j+1→
ΩS2pn−j+1+1. In other words, if θ1/pj
n∈π2pn−jTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/Tpj(n))denotes the
generator (roughly, thought of as σ2(vn−j)), then
π2pn−jTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/Tpj(n))∋θ1/pj
n/mapsto→(θ1/pj−1
n)p∈π2pn−jTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/Tpj−1(n)).
In particular, Conjecture 2.3.22 says that for the putative Efr
2-ringTpn(n), there
is an equivalence THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/Tpn(n))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[σ]with|σ|= 2.
Example 2.3.23. There is an inclusion Spinc(5)∼=Sp(2)·U(1)⊆Sp(3) (whose
quotient is CP5), so that composition with the inclusion Sp(3)⊆SU(6) deﬁnes
an inclusion Sp(2)·U(1)⊆SU(6) . In particular, we obtain an E2-mapΩ(Sp(2)·
U(1))→ΩSU(6) . The Thom spectrum of the resulting composite E2-map
Ω(Sp(2)·U(1))→ΩSU(6)→ΩSU≃BU
deﬁnes an Efr
2-ring, which we expect can be identiﬁed with T8(3)forp= 2.THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 33
3. The topological Sen operator
3.1. Constructing the topological Sen operator. There is a much sim-
pler description of the descent spectral sequence of Remark 2.2.12, following the
perspective of Remark 2.2.17 that Theorem 2.2.4(b) is essen tially a calculation of a
Serre spectral sequence. We will continue to ﬁx E3-forms of the truncated Brown-
Peterson spectra BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htandBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht.
Notation 3.1.1. LetRbe anE∞-Zp-algebra. We will write ǫRto denoteR[BSU(p−
1)]andǫR
∗to denoteπ∗ǫR. (The notation is meant to indicate that ǫonly plays a
“small” role in the below discussion.)
Deﬁnition 3.1.2 (Spectral Gysin sequence) .SupposeSn−1→E→Bis a ﬁbra-
tion. Since E≃hocolimBSn−1in pointed spaces, we have E+≃hocolimBSn−1
+.
There is a coﬁber sequence Sn−1
+→S0→Sn, so we obtain a coﬁber sequence
E+→hocolimB(S0)≃B+→hocolimB(Sn)≃Σn(B+).
IfRis anE1-ring, we get a coﬁber sequence of left R-modules:
R[E]→R[B]→ΣnR[B].
Construction 3.1.3 (Topological Sen operator) .LetCbe anX(n)-linear∞-
category. There is an S1-equivariant equivalence
THH( C/X(n−1))≃THH( C)⊗THH(X(n−1))X(n−1)
≃THH( C)⊗X(n)⊗X(n−1)THH(X(n−1))X(n),
a tautological S1-equivariant equivalence
THH( C/X(n))≃THH( C)⊗THH(X(n))X(n).
SinceTHH(X(n−1))≃X(n−1)[SU(n−1)], there is an equivalence X(n)⊗X(n−1)
THH(X(n−1))≃X(n)[SU(n−1)]. Note that X(n)⊗X(n−1)THH(X(n−1))
admits the structure of an E1-ring, and that the E1-algebra map THH(X(n−
1))→THH(X(n))induces an E1-algebra map X(n)⊗X(n−1)THH(X(n−1))→
THH(X(n))≃X(n)[SU(n)]. The ﬁber sequence
S2n−1→BSU(n−1)→BSU(n)
implies:
Theorem 3.1.4. LetCbe a leftX(n)-linear∞-category. Then there is a coﬁber
sequence
(13) THH( C/X(n−1))ι− →THH( C/X(n))ΘC− − →Σ2nTHH( C/X(n)),
where the map ιisS1-equivariant, and the coﬁber of ιis (at least nonequivariantly)
identiﬁed with Σ2nTHH( C/X(n)). We will call the map ΘC: Σ−2nTHH( C/X(n))→
THH( C/X(n))the topological Sen operator.
Remark 3.1.5. A simpler analogue of Theorem 3.1.4 can be described as follo ws.
LetAbe anEfr
2-ring, and let A[t]be the ﬂat polynomial ring over Aon a generator in
degree0. Suppose Cis anA[t]-linear∞-category. The nonequivariant equivalence
HH(A[t]/A)≃A[t][S1]deﬁnes a coﬁber sequence
(14) HH(C/A)→HH(C/A[t])∇− →Σ2HH(C/A[t])34 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
analogous to Theorem 3.1.4, which exhibits ∇: HH(C/A[t])→Σ2HH(C/A[t])as a
“Gauss-Manin connection”. This coﬁber sequence is often qu ite useful; for example,
if we regard Zpas aS[[t]]-algebra by the E∞-mapS[[t]]→Zpsendingt/mapsto→p, we have
π∗THH(Zp/S[[t]])≃Zp[y]with|y|= 2(more precisely, y=σ2(t−p)); see [KN19 ].
It is not diﬃcult to show that the map ∇: THH(Zp/S[[t]])→Σ2THH(Zp/S[[t]])
sendsyn/mapsto→nyn−1, which implies Bökstedt’s calculation of π∗THH(Zp).
Just as in Theorem 3.1.4, the map HH(C/A)→HH(C/A[t])in (14) isS1-
equivariant, but we can only nonequivariantly identify its coﬁber with Σ2HH(C/A[t]).
To identify the coﬁber equivariantly, observe that if λdenotes the rotation repre-
sentation of S1, thenHH(A/A[t])≃A[BλZ≥0]. Here,BλZ≥0is theλ-delooping of
Z≥0. This implies that there is an equivariant coﬁber sequence
(15) HH(C/A)→HH(C/A[t])∇− →ΣλHH(C/A[t]).
See Corollary 3.1.19 for some further discussion.
Remark 3.1.6. At the level of homotopy, the map Θin (13) for C= LMod BP/angb∇acketleftn−1/angb∇acket∇ight
can be identiﬁed using Theorem 2.2.4. Namely, recall that π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))∼=
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[B∆n]∗[θn]by Theorem 2.2.4(a); it then follows from Theorem 2.2.4(b)
thatΘmust send
Θ :θj
n/mapsto→jpθj−1
n.
Therefore, we may informally write Θ =p∂θn.9From the point of view of Re-
mark 2.2.17, the map Θcan be interpreted as the d2pn-diﬀerential in the Serre
spectral sequence computing the BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-homology of the total space of the ﬁ-
bration (11). Determining the action of ΘonTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj))forj≤n−1
can therefore be viewed as an analogue of determining the diﬀ erentials in the
Serre spectral sequence/Gysin sequence of a putative analo gue of the Cohen-Moore-
Neisendorfer ﬁbration (11) (where pis replaced by vn−j).
One can make some qualitative observations about the action ofΘonTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj))
forj≤n−1. Indeed, recall from (4) that there is an isomorphism
π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj))/v[0,n−j)∼=BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[B∆j]∗[θn]/v[0,n−j)⊗FpΛFp(λj+1,···,λn).
An easy calculation shows that there is an isomorphism
π∗THH(X(pn)/X(pj))∼=X(pn)
n/productdisplay
i=j+1∆i

∗⊗Z(p)Z(p)(λj+1,···,λn).
Therefore, the calculation of π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj))/v[0,n−j)implies that the
image of a class y∈π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj))underΘ : THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj))→
Σ2pjTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pj))lives in the ideal generated by v[0,n−j+1)= (p,···,vn−j).
Remark 3.1.7. The fact that the coﬁber of the S1-equivariant map ι: THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn−
1))→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))is (at least nonequivariantly) identiﬁed with Σ2pnTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))
makes it more diﬃcult to determine TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))(even modulo vn−1)
from our calculation of π∗TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))in Theorem 2.2.4 and the pre-
ceding description of Θas an endomorphism of THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn)). One
9This action of Θonθn=σ2(vn)is related to the observation from [ Lee22 , Lemma 3.2.8(d)]
that there is a choice of vnsuch that the right unit ηR: BP∗→BP∗BP∼=BP∗[t1,t2,···]satisﬁes
d(vn) =ηR(vn)−vn≡ptn(modt1,···,tn−1).THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 35
fundamental question is therefore to describe the S1-action on coﬁb(ι). This is al-
ready complicated modulo pwhenn= 1, and a description of TP(Zp/X(p−1))≃
TP(Zp)[BSU(p−1)]fromTP(Zp/X(p))was essentially done in [ BM94 , Conjec-
ture 4.3] and [ Tsa97 , Theorem 7.4]. Recall from Theorem 2.2.4(a) that there is an
isomorphism
π∗TP(Zp/X(p))/p∼=Fp[v1,/planck⋊ver2pi1±1]⊗FpǫFp
∗∼=π∗k(1)tS1[BSU(p−1)].
Then, the map π∗TP(Zp/X(p))/p→π∗−2pTP(Zp/X(p))/pis given by
/planck⋊ver2pi1pk/mapsto→/planck⋊ver2pi1pk(p+1)vpk+1−p
p−1
1, vk
1/mapsto→0.
This is a direct consequence of [ Tsa97 , Theorem 7.4], once one notes that the the
formulatpk+φ(k+1)fφ(k)fromloc. cit. becomes precisely /planck⋊ver2pi1pk(p+1)vpk+1−p
p−1
1 , via the
translation in notation given by
t/squiggleright/planck⋊ver2pi1, f/squigglerightσ2(v1), tf/squigglerightv1, φ(k) =pk+1−p
p−1=vp((pk)!p).
One could also prove this using an argument similar to [ HRW22 , Theorem 6.5.1].
Moreover, the image of /planck⋊ver2pi1under the boundary map π−2TP(Zp/X(p))/p→
π2p−3TP(Zp/X(p−1))/pis the classα1∈π2p−3TP(Zp)/p; note that since /planck⋊ver2pi1lives in
π−2TP(Zp/X(p)), the classα1in fact extends to an element of π2p−3TP(Zp/X(p−
1)). The problem of calculating π∗TP(Zp)fromTP(Zp/X(p))is very similar to the
problem of π∗TP(Zp)fromTP(Zp/S[[t]]), discussed in [ LW20 ] (see Remark 3.1.5).
If we assume Conjecture 2.1.9, then Theorem 3.1.4 can be reﬁn ed: namely, if
Cis a leftT(n)-linear∞-category, then there is a coﬁber sequence
(16) THH( C/T(n−1))ι− →THH( C/T(n))ΘC− − →Σ2pnTHH( C/T(n)).
Remark 3.1.8. Supposen= 1andC= Mod Zpforpodd. Then there is a map
TP(Zp)→TP(Zp/T(1)), and a trace map K(Zp)→TP(Zp). Letj=τ≥0LK(1)S;
uponp-adic completion, there is an equivalence (see [ BM94 , Theorem 9.17])
K(Zp)∧
p≃j∨Σj∨Σ3ku.
The summand jis the unit component, i.e., there is an E∞-ring mapj→K(Zp)∧
p.
It follows that after p-completion, there is a ring map j→TP(Zp). Assuming the
equivalence TP(Zp/T(1))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1of Conjecture 2.2.18, the following diagram
commutes:

Letℓbe a topological generator of Z×
p, and letψℓ: BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Σ2p−2BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}htbe the
associated Adams operation. Then, the ﬁber of ψℓ−1isj. Based on the above
commutative diagram, one expects that under the equivalenc eTP(Zp/T(1))≃
BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1of Conjecture 2.2.18, the map ψℓ−1is closely related to ΘtS1
Zp. Note,
for example, that if we take ℓ=p+ 1, the map ψℓ−1sendsvj
1/mapsto→pvp(j)+1vj

up top-adic units; this should be compared to the fact that ΘZpsendsθj
1/mapsto→
jpθj−1
1by Remark 3.1.6. This discussion, as well as the classical di scussion in36 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
[BM94 ], suggests that TP(Zp)∧
p≃(jtS1)∧
p. In fact, something stronger is true:
in forthcoming work [ DR23 ] with Arpon Raksit, we will show that THH(Zp) =
τ≥0(jtZ/p)as cyclotomic E∞-rings.
Example 3.1.9. Letn= 1, and let C= Mod BP/angb∇acketleft1/angb∇acket∇ight. Then Theorem 3.1.4 gives a
coﬁber sequence
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(p−1))→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(p))ΘBP/angbracketleft1/angbracketright− −−−→Σ2pTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(p)).
Moreover, recall from Theorem 2.2.4(b) that there is a p-complete equivalence
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(p))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[BSU(p−1)]⊕/circleplusdisplay

THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(p−1))≃THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)[BSU(p−1)], the calculations of [ AHL10 ,
Section 6] can be rephrased as follows. For 0≤k≤vp(j),ΘBP/angb∇acketleft1/angb∇acket∇ightis given on

up top-adic units. A diﬀerent perspective on this computation is g iven in [ Lee22 ].
Variant 3.1.10. One can prove a variant of Theorem 3.1.4 by replacing X(p)with
J(p). IfCis a leftJ(p)-linear∞-category, then Proposition 2.3.2 produces a coﬁber
sequence:
(17) THH( C)ι− →THH( C/J(p))Θ′
−→Σ2THH( C/J(p)).
Here, the map ιisS1-equivariant, and coﬁb(ι)is (at least nonequivariantly) identi-
ﬁed with Σ2THH( C/J(p)). Proposition 2.3.3 shows that THH(Zp/J(p))≃Zp[ΩS3].
On homotopy, the map THH(Zp/J(p))→Σ2THH(Zp/J(p))is given by the d2-
diﬀerential in the Serre spectral sequence for the ﬁbration
S1→ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →ΩS3.
For example, under the isomorphism π∗THH(Zp/J(p))∼=Zp[x]with|x|= 2, the
mapΘ′in the coﬁber sequence (17) for n= 1sendsxj/mapsto→jxj−1.
Suppose Cis in fact a Zp-linear∞-category. Base-changing (17) along the map
Zp→Fpand using Corollary 2.3.7, we obtain a coﬁber sequence
(18) THH( C)⊗ZpFpι− →THH( C⊗ZpFp)Θ′
− →Σ2THH( C⊗ZpFp).
Note that the map Θ′: THH(Fp)→Σ2THH(Fp)sendsσj/mapsto→jσj−1on homotopy.
It follows that upon composition with σ: Σ2THH( C⊗ZpFp)→THH( C⊗ZpFp),Θ′
acts by multiplication by jon the homotopy of the jth graded piece grj
σTHH( C⊗Zp
Fp)of theσ-adic ﬁltration on THH( C⊗ZpFp).
Remark 3.1.11. Letp= 2. Using the ﬁber sequence
S3→BU(1)→BU(2),
one can similarly show that if T4(2)denotes the Efr
2-ring from Construction 2.3.9
andCis a leftT4(2)-linear∞-category, there is a coﬁber sequence
THH( C/J(2))→THH( C/T4(2))→Σ4THH( C/T4(2)).THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 37
Remark 3.1.12. LetRbe an animated Zp-algebra. Let ˆ∆Rdenote the Nygaard-
completed prismatic cohomology of R, and Niˆ∆Rdenote the ith graded piece of
the Nygaard ﬁltration N≥⋆(ˆ∆R). Note that [ BL22a , Remark 5.5.15] gives an
isomorphism Ni(ˆ∆R{i})∼=Niˆ∆R, whereˆ∆R{i}denotes the Breuil-Kisin twisted
prismatic cohomology of R. Using the methods of [ BM22 ], one can construct a
coﬁber sequence
(19) (Niˆ∆R)/p→Fconj
idR(R/p)/Fp∼=Niˆ∆R/p→Fconj
i−1dR(R/p)/Fp.
As explained in loc. cit. , the second map is closely related to the Sen operator.
Recall (see [ BL22a , Example 6.4.17] and [ BMS19 ]) thatTHH(R/p)admits a
motivic ﬁltration such that gri
motTHH(R/p) =Ni(ˆ∆R/p)[2i]. Taking C= ModR,
(18) says that there is a self-map Θ′: THH(R/p)→Σ2THH(R/p)whose ﬁber is
THH(R)/p. Presumably, the coﬁber sequence (18) can be shown to respec t the
motivic ﬁltration, so taking graded pieces would recover th e coﬁber sequence (19).
Given this discussion, it is natural to ask if THH(R/J(p))admits a motivic ﬁltration
such that (17) is a coﬁber sequence of motivically-ﬁltered s pectra.
Recollection 3.1.13. Let(Zp[[/tildewidep]],/tildewidep)denote the prism of [ BL22a , Notation 3.8.9],
and ifRis ap-complete animated Zp-algebra, let/tildewidepΩRdenote ∆R/Zp[[/tildewidep]]. In partic-
ular,/tildewidepΩR≃(qΩR)hF×
p, via the F×
p-action on the prism (Zp[[q−1]],[p]q). Let/hatwideΩ/D
R
denote the diﬀracted Hodge complex of [ BL22a , Construction 4.7.1], so that /hatwideΩ/D
R
is isomorphic to /tildewidepΩR//tildewidepby [BL22a , Remark 4.8.6]. Recall the coﬁber sequence of
[BL22a , Remark 5.5.8]:
Niˆ∆R→Fconj
i/hatwideΩ/D
RΘ+i− −− →Fconj
i−1/hatwideΩ/D
R.
The modpreduction of this ﬁber sequence produces (19).
SinceTHH(R)admits a motivic ﬁltration whose graded pieces are Ni(ˆ∆R)[2i],
the coﬁber sequence (17) motivates the following conjectur e (which essentially states
thatTHH(R/J(p))is a sheared Rees construction on the conjugate ﬁltration of /hatwideΩ/D
R):
Conjecture 3.1.14. LetRbe an animated Zp-algebra. Then there is a ﬁltration

Remark 3.1.15. Recall from Proposition 2.3.2 that there is an equivalence THH(X(p)/J(p))≃
X(p)[SU(p−1)×Jp−1(S2)]. Using this, it is not diﬃcult to show that Conjec-
ture 3.1.14 implies that if Ris an animated Zp-algebra, then THH(R/X(p))admits
a motivic ﬁltration such that gri

utility of the discussion in Construction 2.3.9 is that alth ough describing a higher
chromatic analogue of J(p)is tricky (see Conjecture 2.3.22), THH( C/X(pn))fur-
nishes a natural higher chromatic and noncommutative analo gue of the diﬀracted
Hodge complex when Cis a leftBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-linear∞-category.
Remark 3.1.16. We collect some further evidence for Conjecture 3.1.14:
(a) Recall that if Dis anFp-linear∞-category, then the canonical map
THH( D)→HH(D/Fp)is given by quotienting by σ∈π2THH(Fp). More-
over, ifRis an animated Fp-algebra, then gri
motTHH(R)≃(Fconj
idRR/Fp)[2i],
andFσ
⋆THH(R)is a noncommutative analogue of the conjugate ﬁltration
Fconj
⋆dRR/Fp. In particular, the induced motivic ﬁltration on THH(R)/σ
hasgri
mot(THH(R)/σ)≃LΩi
R/Fp[−i].
This picture admits an analogue over J(p). Recall from Proposi-
tion 2.3.3(a) that π∗THH(Zp/J(p))∼=Zp[x]with|x|= 2. Let Cbe aZp-
linear∞-category. One could attempt to deﬁne the quotient THH( C/J(p))/x
as a relative tensor product of THH( C/J(p))withZpoverTHH(Zp/J(p)).
Unfortunately, this tensor product does not make sense, sin ceTHH(Zp/J(p))
does not naturally acquire the structure of an E1-algebra. However, were
J(p)to admit the structure of an E3-algebra, the above relative tensor
product would precisely be computing HH(C/Zp) = THH( C)⊗THH(Zp)Zp.
It is therefore reasonable to view the canonical map THH( C/J(p))→
HH(C/Zp)as a quotient by x. IfRis an animated Zp-algebra, then
HH(R/Zp)is a noncommutative analogue of the Hodge complex/circleplustext
n≥0L/hatwideΩn
R/Zp[−n].
Under Conjecture 3.1.14, the perspective that the map THH( C/J(p))→
HH(C/Zp)is given by “killing x” can be regarded as an analogue of
[BL22a , Remark 4.7.14], which identiﬁes grconj
i/hatwideΩ/D
R≃L/hatwideΩi
R/Zp[−i].
(b) LetRbe a smooth Zp-algebra. Then the prismatic-crystalline compari-
son theorem (see [ BL22a , Remark 4.7.18]) implies that the base-change
Fp⊗ZpFconj
⋆/hatwideΩ/D
Rcan be identiﬁed with Frob∗Fconj
⋆Ω•
R/p/Fp, whereFrob :
R→Ris the absolute Frobenius. Under Conjecture 3.1.14, Coroll ary 2.3.7
can be viewed as a noncommutative analogue of this result.
(c) By Proposition 2.3.3, the class xis sent toσ∈π2THH(Fp)under the map
ι: THH(Zp/J(p))→THH(Fp). Since the cyclotomic Frobenius induces
an equivalence ϕ: THH(Fp)[1/σ]∼− →THH(Fp)tZ/p, the coﬁber sequence
of (18) predicts a coﬁber sequence
(20)THH( C)tZ/p⊗ZpFpι− →THH( C⊗ZpFp)tZ/pΘ′
− →THH( C⊗ZpFp)tZ/p.
Such a coﬁber sequence does indeed exist, and we will constru ct it below
in Corollary 3.1.19 (albeit using slightly diﬀerent method s).
Suppose that the coﬁber sequence (20) respects the motivic ﬁ ltration
when C= ModR. Since THH(R)tZ/p≃HP((R/p)/Fp)(see [Mat20 ,
Proposition 2.12]) and HP((R/p)/Fp)has a motivic ﬁltration such that
gri
motHP((R/p)/Fp)≃dR(R/p)/Fp[2i], the coﬁber sequence (20) would
presumably be related under Conjecture 3.1.14 to the follow ing coﬁber se-
quence related to (19) (whose existence was told to me by Akhi l Mathew):
(21) ∆R/p→dR(R/p)/Fp→dR(R/p)/Fp.
For completeness, we give an argument for (21).THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 39
Proof of the cofiber sequence (21).Recall from [ BM22 , Corollary 3.16]
that ifAis an animated Zp[x]-algebra, there is a coﬁber sequence
(22) ∆A{i}/x→∆A/x{i} →∆A/x{i−1}.
This implies (by setting i= 0and viewing R/pas the base-change R⊗Zp[x]Zp, where
the map Zp[x]→Rsendsx/mapsto→p, and the map Zp[x]→Zpis the augmentation)
that there is a coﬁber sequence
∆R/p→∆R/p→∆R/p.
The de Rham/crystalline comparison theorems tell us that ∆R/p≃∆(R/p)/Zp≃
(dRR)∧
p, where ∆(R/p)/Zpdenotes prismatic cohomology with respect to the crys-
talline prism (Zp,(p))(i.e., the derived crystalline cohomology of R/p). But then
∆R/p≃dR(R/p)/Fp, as desired.
Let us remark that (22) can be constructed using WCartHT
Ga. Indeed, we
can reduce to the case when Ais thep-completion of Zp[x] =OGa. Then,
[BL22b , Example 9.1] implies that Spec(Zp)×GaWCartHT
Ga∼=B(G♯
a⋊G♯
m). Let
α: WCartHT
Zp→WCartHT
Gabe the tautological map, so that it factors through a
mapf: WCartHT
Zp→Spec(Zp)×GaWCartHT
Ga, which can in turn be identiﬁed with
the mapBG♯
m→B(G♯

LetFbe a quasicoherent sheaf on WCartHT

implies that coﬁb(F/x→f∗α∗F)can be identiﬁed with OWCartHT
Zp{−1}⊗f∗α∗F.
Setting F=OWCartHT

We now construct a more general version of the coﬁber sequenc e (20). We ﬁrst
need the following lemma:
Lemma 3.1.17. LetG⊆S1be a nontrivial ﬁnite subgroup of S1, and letλdenote
the rotation representation of S1onC.
(a) Deﬁne (Sλ)(1)via the coﬁber sequence
G+→S0→(Sλ)(1).
Then there is a coﬁber sequence
Σ(G+)→(Sλ)(1)→Sλ.
(b) LetXbe a spectrum with G-action. Then XtG∼− →(ΣλX)tG.
11Here, we declare γ−1(x) = 0.40 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Proof. Part (a) describes an equivariant CW-structure on Sλ; we leave this
as an exercise to the reader. Part (b) follows by observing th at the coﬁber sequence
G+⊗X→X→(Sλ)(1)⊗X
implies that XtG∼− →((Sλ)(1)⊗X)tG; and the coﬁber sequence
X⊗Σ(G+)→X⊗(Sλ)(1)→ΣλX
implies that (X⊗(Sλ)(1))tG∼− →(ΣλX)tG. /square
Proposition 3.1.18. LetS[π] =S[Z≥0]. For anyS[π]-linear∞-category C, there
are coﬁber sequences
THH( C)tZ/p⊗S[π]S→THH( C⊗S[π]S)tZ/p∇tZ/p
− −−− →THH( C⊗S[π]S)tZ/p, (23)
TP(C)→TP(C/S[π])∇tS1
− −− →TP(C/S[π]). (24)
Proof. We will use (15) with A=S(here, the variable tis relabeled as π).
This gives us an S1-equivariant coﬁber sequence
(25) THH( C)→THH( C/S[π])→ΣλTHH( C/S[π]).
To prove the coﬁber sequence (23), we ﬁrst apply tZ/pto the preceding coﬁber
sequence:
THH( C)tZ/p→THH( C/S[π])tZ/p→(ΣλTHH( C/S[π]))tZ/p.
Observe that the tensor product THH( C)tZ/p⊗S[π]Salong the augmentation
S[π]→Ssendingπ/mapsto→0is precisely THH( C)tZ/p⊗S[π]S. Similarly, THH( C/S[π])tZ/p⊗S[π]
S≃THH( C⊗S[π]S)tZ/p. It therefore suﬃces to show that (ΣλTHH( C/S[π]))tZ/p≃
THH( C/S[π])tZ/p; but this is exactly Lemma 3.1.17.
The coﬁber sequence (24) is even easier to construct: applyi ngtS1to (25), we
obtain a coﬁber sequence
TP(C)→TP(C/S[π])→(ΣλTHH( C/S[π]))tS1.
Since there is a coﬁber sequence
S1
+→S0→Sλ,
we see that there is an equivalence XtS1∼− →(ΣλX)tS1for anyS1-spectrumX. In
particular, (ΣλTHH( C/S[π]))tS1≃TP(C/S[π]), as desired. /square
Corollary 3.1.19. LetKbe a number ﬁeld, let p⊆OKbe a prime ideal over p,

letk=R/πbe the residue ﬁeld, so that there is an E∞-mapS[π]→Rsending

3.2. Some calculations of THHrelative to X(p)andΘ.We now calculate
the topological Sen operator for perfectoid rings; these ca lculations lend further
evidence for Conjecture 3.1.14.
Recollection 3.2.1. LetRbe a perfectoid ring. Recall that Ainf(R) =W(R♭), so
thatLAinf(R)/Zpisp-completely zero. Let A+
inf(R)denote the spherical Witt vectors
W+(R♭)of [Lur18 , Example 5.2.7].
Lemma 3.2.2. Letξbe a generator of the kernel of Fontaine’s map θ:Ainf(R)→
R. LetΩ2S3→BGL1(A+
inf(R))denote the E2-map which detects 1−ξ∈Ainf(R)×
on the bottom cell of the source. Then there is an equivalence ofE2-A+
inf(R)-algebras
between the ξ-adic completion of Ainf(R)and theξ-adic completion of the Thom
spectrum of the following composite:
gξ: Ω2S3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Ω2S3→BGL1(A+
inf(R)).
In particular, there is an equivalence THH(Ainf(R)∧
ξ/A+
inf(R)∧
ξ)≃Ainf(R)∧
ξ[ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht]
ofE2-Ainf(R)∧
ξ-algebras.
Proof. Recall from [ Mao20 , Theorem 1.13] that the Thom spectrum of the
mapΩ2S3→BGL1(A+
inf(R))is equivalent to Ras anE2-A+
inf(R)-algebra. The
ﬁber sequence
Ω2S3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Ω2S3→S1
implies that there is a class ξ∈π0(Ω2S3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)gξand a map S1→BGL1(Ω2S3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)gξ
detecting 1−ξ, such that its Thom spectrum is R. This implies that there is a
coﬁber sequence
(Ω2S3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)gξξ− →(Ω2S3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)gξ→R.
It follows that the ξ-adic completion (Ω2S3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)gξis equivalent to Ainf(R)∧
ξ. The
claim about THH follows in the standard manner using [ BCS10 ]./square
Remark 3.2.3. In fact, the calculation from [ BMS19 , Theorem 6.1] that π∗THH(R)∼=
R[σ]is equivalent to [ Mao20 , Theorem 1.13] (which constructs Ras the Thom
spectrum of the map Ω2S3→BGL1(A+
inf(R))). The equivalence between these two
statements can be proved similarly to [ KN19 , Remark 1.5].
Proposition 3.2.4. LetRbe ap-complete perfectoid ring. Then there is a p-
complete equivalence
THH(R/X(p))≃R[CP∞×ΩS2p+1]⊗RǫR.
In particular, if θdenotes the “polynomial12” generator in degree 2parising via the
James ﬁltration on ΩS2p+1andR/an}b∇acketle{tu/an}b∇acket∇i}ht=π∗R[CP∞]is (the underlying R-module
of) a divided power algebra on a class uin degree 2, then there is a p-complete
isomorphism
π∗THH(R/X(p))≃R[θ]/an}b∇acketle{tu/an}b∇acket∇i}ht⊗RǫR
∗.
Proof. LetX(p)ξdenote the ξ-adic completion of the Thom spectrum of the
composite
ΩSU(p)→ΩS2p−1α1−→Ω2S3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →BGL1(A+
inf(R)).
12Recall that THH(R/X(p))is not a ring; the word polynomial simply means the subspace
generated by R[ΩS2p+1]∗.42 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Then, the map THH(X(p)ξ)→THH(X(p))⊗A+
inf(R)∧
ξis a(p,ξ)-complete equiv-
alence: indeed, the above composite is determined as an E1-map by the composite
SU(p)→S2p−1(1−ξ)α1− −−−− →B2GL1(A+
inf(R)).
Since1−ξis a unit in π0A+
inf(R)∼=Ainf(R), it suﬃces to prove that the map
THH(A+
inf(R)∧
ξ)→A+
inf(R)∧
ξis a(p,ξ)-complete equivalence. But this is clear:
after killing ξand tensoring with Fp, we obtain the map HH(R♭/Fp)→R♭, which
is an equivalence since R♭is perfect.
It then follows from Lemma 3.2.2 and the same argument used to prove Theo-
rem 2.2.4(a) that there are (p,ξ)-complete equivalences
THH(Ainf(R)∧
ξ/X(p))≃THH(Ainf(R)∧
ξ/X(p)ξ)≃Ainf(R)[ΩS2p+1×BSU(p−1)].
Therefore, there are p-complete equivalences
THH(R/X(p))≃THH(R/X(p)ξ)
≃THH(R/A+
inf(R)∧
ξ)⊗THH(Ainf(R)∧

ξ)⊗Ainf(R)∧
ξ[ΩS3/angb∇acketleft3/angb∇acket∇ight]Ainf(R)∧
ξ[ΩS2p+1×BSU(p−1)].
SinceRis perfectoid, [ BMS19 , Theorem 6.1] implies that THH(R/A+
inf(R))≃
R[ΩS3]. The map THH(W(R♭))→THH(R)induced by the unit can be identiﬁed
with the composite W(R♭)[ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht]→R[ΩS3], induced by Fontaine’s map θ:
Ainf(R)→R. There is a p-local Cartesian square

which implies that
THH(R/X(p))≃R[ΩS2p+1×CP∞×BSU(p−1)],
as desired. Alternatively, there are equivalences
THH(R/X(p)ǫ)≃THH(R/A+
inf(R)∧
ξ)⊗THH(X(p)ǫ/A+
inf(R)∧

≃R[ΩS3]⊗R[SU(p)]R.
The desired calculation follows from the observation that t here is ap-local ﬁbration
SU(p)≃SU(p−1)×S2p−1∗×α1− −− →ΩS3Hp×ι−−−→ΩS2p+1×CP∞×BSU(p−1)
which is induced by the Cartesian square (28). /square
Remark 3.2.5. Proposition 3.2.4 has the following slight variant: if Ris ap-
complete perfectoid ring, then there is a p-complete equivalence THH(R/J(p))≃
R[ΩS3×CP∞]. The only modiﬁcation is that one instead has to use the p-local
Cartesian square
ΩS3/an}b∇acketle{t3/an}b∇acket∇i}ht
/d15/d15/d47/d47ΩS3
/d15/d15
ΩS3 /d47/d47ΩS3×CP∞,THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 43
which supplies a ﬁbration
S1→ΩS3→ΩS3×CP∞.
In particular, the above discussion shows that π∗THH(R/J(p))∼=R[x]/an}b∇acketle{tu/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. This is
compatible with Conjecture 3.1.14:
(a) First,π∗THH(R/J(p))[x−1]∼=R[x±1]/an}b∇acketle{tu
x/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. Sinceu
xlives in degree 0, Con-
jecture 3.1.14 predicts that /hatwideΩ/D
R∼=R/an}b∇acketle{tu
x/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. This is indeed true: [ BL22a ,
Example 4.7.6] implies that the diﬀracted Hodge complex of a p-complete
perfectoid ring Ris a divided power R-algebra on a single class in degree
zero.
(b) Second, τ(2n−2,2n]THH(R/J(p))is equivalent to/circleplustext
0≤j≤nR·γj(u)xn−j,
so that Conjecture 3.1.14 predicts that Fconj
i/hatwideΩ/D
Ris isomorphic to the R-
submodule of /hatwideΩ/D
Rgenerated by {γj(u
x)}0≤j≤n. This is indeed true: see (∗n)
in the proof of [ BL22a , Lemma 5.6.14]. In the same way, τ(2(n−1)p,2np]THH(R/T(1))
is a freeR-module spanned by θiγj(u)for(n−1−i)p < j≤(n−i)p.
This includes γj(u)for(n−1)p<j≤np, but also terms such as θnand
θn−1γp(u).
Remark 3.2.6. We can understand the calculation of Proposition 3.2.4 more al-
gebraically as follows. There is a p-local ﬁber sequence
(29) S2p−1→ΩS3→CP∞×ΩS2p+1,
where the second map is given by the product of the canonical m apΩS3→CP∞
with the James-Hopf map ΩS3→ΩS2p+1. The Serre spectral sequence in Zp-
homology for (29) is given by
E2
∗,∗=Zp/an}b∇acketle{tu/an}b∇acket∇i}ht⊗ZpZp[θ,ǫ]/ǫ2⇒π∗Zp[ΩS3]∼=Zp[σ],
whereǫlives in degree 2p−1. It is not diﬃcult to show that there is a single family
of diﬀerentials given by
d2p(γpn(u)) =ǫn−1/productdisplay
j=1γpj(u)p−1, d2p(θj) =jpθj−1ǫ.
where the equality is to be understood up to p-adic units. The above description
implies that the map d2p:E2
2np,0→E2
2np−2p,2p−1is surjective, and its kernel is a
freeZp-module of rank 1(for example, one can calculate an explicit (n+ 1)×n-
matrix with coeﬃcients in Zpwhich describes d2p). IfRis a perfectoid ring, this
discussion determines the Serre spectral sequence in R-homology for (29). Since
thed2p-diﬀerential in this spectral sequence is just the eﬀect of t he topological Sen
operator ΘR: THH(R/X(p))→Σ2pTHH(R/X(p))on homotopy, we see that ΘR
is given (up to p-adic units) by the map
γpn(u)/mapsto→n−1/productdisplay
j=1γpj(u)p−1.44 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR

Therefore, we may informally write ΘR=u1−p∂u. The division by upcan be
viewed as accounting for the shift by 2pinΘR. Note that if Risp-torsionfree,
this operator can in turn be interpreted as p∂up. Similarly, under the isomorphism
π∗THH(R/J(p))∼=R[x]/an}b∇acketle{tu/an}b∇acket∇i}ht, the operator Θ′
R: THH(R/J(p))→Σ2THH(R/J(p))
can be interpreted as ∂u.
A slight variant of the above discussion proves an analogous statement for Z/pn.
Deﬁnition 3.2.7. LetYndenote the ﬁber of the composite
HP∞→K(Z,4)→K(Z/pn−1,4).
Proposition 3.2.8. Fix an odd prime p. There are equivalences
THH(Z/pn/X(p))≃Z/pn[ΩS2p+1×B2(pn−1Z)]⊗Z/pnǫZ/pn,
THH(Z/pn/J(p))≃Z/pn[ΩS3×B2(pn−1Z)],
where the map Fp⊗Z/pnTHH(Z/pn/J(p))→THH(Fp/J(p))is given by the map
Fp[ΩS3×B2(pn−1Z)]→Fp[ΩS3×B2(Z)]induced by pn−1Z⊆Z.
Proof. In [Kit20 ], it was shown that Z/pnis the Thom spectrum of the
E2-map
Ω3Yn→Ω3HP∞≃Ω2S3→BGL1(S0),
which implies that THH(Z/pn)≃Z/pn[Ω2Yn]. Note that there is a canonical map
Ω2Yn→ΩS3, and hence a map Ω2Yn→CP∞. Just as with Proposition 3.2.4, we
have
THH(Z/pn/X(p))≃THH(Z/pn)⊗THH(X(p))X(p)
≃THH(Z/pn)⊗THH(Zp)THH(Zp/X(p))

Remark 3.2.9. One could also deduce Proposition 3.2.8 for n≥2from Proposi-
tion 3.2.4 for Fp, using descent and the fact that HH(Fp/Z/pn) =Fp[K(Z/pn−1,2)].
Indeed, the composite S1pn−1

imply that Fpis the Thom spectrum of a map BZ/pn−1→BGL1(Z/pn)which
detects1−p∈(Z/pn)×on the bottom cell of the source. Applying [ BCS10 ]
implies the desired calculation of HH(Fp/Z/pn).
Remark 3.2.10. There is a higher chromatic analogue of Proposition 3.2.8. T o
explain this, recall from [ Lur15 , Construction 3.5.1] that there is an E2-algebra
S((/planck⋊ver2pi1))over the sphere spectrum with |/planck⋊ver2pi1|=−2. It follows from [ DHL+23, Corol-
lary 3.12] that S((/planck⋊ver2pi1))can be upgraded to an Efr
2-algebra. Tensoring with X(pn)
therefore deﬁnes an Efr
2-ringX(pn)((/planck⋊ver2pi1)); in particular, one can deﬁne THH relative
toX(pn)((/planck⋊ver2pi1)). TheE2-mapX(pn)→BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1factors through

ofBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht(viewed as a class in π−2BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1). The calculation of Theo-
rem 2.2.4 implies that
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1/X(pn)((/planck⋊ver2pi1)))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1[ΩS2pn+1×B∆n].

/planckover2pi1, where [m](/planck⋊ver2pi1)
denotes the m-series of the formal group law over BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗. This can be viewed
as the Thom spectrum of a map S1→BGL1(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1)detecting 1+[m](/planckover2pi1)
/planckover2pi1∈
π0(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1)×. It follows that
(30)THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/m/X(pn)((/planck⋊ver2pi1)))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/m[BS1×ΩS2pn+1×B∆n].
Whenn= 1, there is an equivalence BP/an}b∇acketle{t0/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/m≃(Z/m)tS1, and (30) can be viewed
as the equivalence of Proposition 3.2.8, base-changed alon gZ/m→(Z/m)tS1.
SinceB2(pn−1Z)∼=CP∞(more canonically, it is the total space of the line bun-
dleO(pn−1)over the standard CP∞), Proposition 3.2.8 implies that π∗THH(Z/pn/J(p))∼=
Z/pn[x]/an}b∇acketle{tun/an}b∇acket∇i}htwith|un|=|x|= 2. Were Conjecture 3.1.14 to hold, Proposition 3.2.8
would imply that /hatwideΩ/D
Z/pnis a (discrete) divided power algebra over Z/pn. In [BL22b ,
Example 5.15], it is shown that if G♯
adenotes the PD-completion of Gaat the ori-
gin, then Spec(Z/pn)/D⊗Fp∼=G♯
a⊗Fpin the notation of [ BL22b ]. This implies
that/hatwideΩ/D
Z/pn⊗Z/pnFpis isomorphic to the divided power algebra Fp/an}b∇acketle{ttn/an}b∇acket∇i}htfor|tn|= 0.
However, as predicted by Conjecture 3.1.14, there is in fact no need to reduce mod-
ulop: Corollary 3.2.15 below says that /hatwideΩ/D
Z/pnis indeed isomorphic to the divided
power algebra Z/pn/an}b∇acketle{ttn/an}b∇acket∇i}htfor|tn|= 0.
I am grateful to Bhargav Bhatt for the statement of the follow ing lemma,
which is analogous to the calculation that if Ris a commutative ring and x∈Ris
a regular element, then there is a p-complete equivalence dRR/x/R≃R/an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/x(see
[Bha12 , Theorem 8.4]). The argument for Lemma 3.2.11 below is my int erpretation
of Bhatt’s explanation. The topological discussion above c an be regarded as an46 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
analogue of the calculation that HH(R/x/R)≃R[CP∞]/x. We will freely use
notation from [ BL22a, BL22b ] below.
Lemma 3.2.11. Let(A,I)be a transversal prism (i.e., A/Iisp-torsionfree). Let
x∈Abe an element such that x(modI)is regular in A:=A/I, and such that
(x)⊆Aisφ-stable. Then WCartHT
A/(I,x)/Aisp-completely isomorphic to G♯
a×
Spf(A/(I,x)), so that ∆A/(I,x)/A∼=A/(I,x)/an}b∇acketle{tt/an}b∇acket∇i}htwith|t|= 0.
Proof. By [BL22b , Proposition 5.12], the map WCartHT
A/(I,x)/A→Spf(A/(I,x))
is a split gerbe, banded by TA/(I,x)/A{1}♯. In this case, since x(modI)is a reg-
ular element of A, we see that LA/(I,x)/A= (x)/(x2)[1], so thatTA/(I,x)/A=
SpfSymA/(I,x)(LA/(I,x)/A)∧
pis isomorphic to ΩGaoverA/(I,x). It follows that
WCartHT
A/(I,x)/Ais isomorphic to a trivial G♯
a-torsor over Spf(A/(I,x)). Since
∆A/(I,x)/Ais the global sections of the structure sheaf of WCartHT
A/(I,x)/A, the lemma
follows. /square
Remark 3.2.12. In fact, the conjugate ﬁltration Fconj
i∆A/(I,x)/Ais isomorphic to
the divided power ﬁltration on A/(I,x)/an}b∇acketle{tt/an}b∇acket∇i}htunder Lemma 3.2.11.
Remark 3.2.13. Sticking with the assumptions of Lemma 3.2.11, let us mentio n
without proof that Lemma 3.2.11 is also a consequence of [ BS19 , Example 7.9],
which states that ∆A/(I,x)/A∼=A{x
I}∧
(p,I). IfI= (d)is principal, the p-complete

The mapβsendsγpn(t)/mapsto→δn(x
d)(up top-adic units). This can be proved by
showing that in the setting of Lemma 3.2.11, φ(δn(x
d))∈(d)⊆A{x
d}ifn≥0(see
Lemma 3.2.14 below). The fact that
φ/parenleftBig
δn/parenleftBigx

then implies that δn(x
d)p≡ −pδn+1(x
d) (modd). Therefore, the elements δn(x
d)
can be used to deﬁne divided powers ofx
d(modd). In particular, we obtain the
desired map β:A/(I,x)/an}b∇acketle{tt/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →A{x
d}∧
(p,d)/d, but further work is required to show
that it is a p-complete isomorphism.
Lemma 3.2.14. Fix notation as in Lemma 3.2.11. Then φ(δn(x
d))∈(d)⊆A{x
d}.
Proof. Lett=x
d. The desired claim can be proved by induction on n. For
the base case, we need to show that φ(t)∈I. By reduction to the universal case, we
may assume that (p,d)is regular in A. Then [ AL20 , Lemma 3.6] implies that the
sequence (d,φ(d))is regular in A. Since(x)isφ-stable, we see that ddividesφ(x);
it then follows from the formula φ(d)φ(t) =φ(x)thatddividesφ(t), as desired.
For the inductive step, observe that
pφ(δn+1(t)) =pδ(φ(δn(t))) =φ2(δn(t))−φ(δn(t))p.THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 47
The inductive hypothesis says that φ(δn(t))∈(d)for everyk≥1, so thatddivides
pφ(δn+1(t)). Since(p,d)is a regular sequence, this implies that ddividesφ(δn+1(t)),
as desired. /square
This implies the following result, which is also proved in [ Pet23 , Lemma 6.13].
Corollary 3.2.15. There is an isomorphism Spec(Z/pn)/D∼=G♯
a×Spec(Z/pn)of
Z/pn-schemes. In particular, the scaling action of G♯
monG♯
aoverZ/pngives an
isomorphism WCartHT
Z/pn∼=G♯
a/G♯
mofZ/pn-stacks.
Proof. Recall that ∆Z/pn/Zp[[/tildewidep]]=/hatwideΩ/D
Z/pn. Lemma 3.2.11 implies that ∆Z/pn/Zp[[/tildewidep]]∼=
Z/pn/an}b∇acketle{tt/an}b∇acket∇i}htwith|t|= 0; this gives the desired claim. (It is useful to view γpm(t)as a
p-adic unit multiple of δm(pn
/tildewidep), as described in Remark 3.2.13.)
Alternatively, consider the transversal prism (A,I) = (Zp[[q−1]],[p]q), and let
x= (q−1)n(p−1). Note that φ(x)∈(x), so(x)isφ-stable. Then A/I∼=Zp[ζp],
andA/(I,x)is isomorphic to Zp[ζp]/(ζp−1)n(p−1)∼=Z/pn[ζp]since thep-adic val-
uation of (ζp−1)n(p−1)isn. It follows from Lemma 3.2.11 that ∆Z/pn[ζp]/Zp[[q−1]]∼=
Z/pn[ζp]/an}b∇acketle{tt′/an}b∇acket∇i}htwith|t′|= 0. There is an action of Z×
p(and hence F×
p⊆Z×
p) on(A,I);
takingF×
p-ﬁxed points produces an isomorphism
∆Z/pn/Zp[[/tildewidep]]∼=(∆Z/pn[ζp]/Zp[[q−1]])hF×
p∼=Z/pn/an}b∇acketle{tt/an}b∇acket∇i}ht
with|t|= 0, as desired. Note that as described in Remark 3.2.13, the div ided power
γpm(t′)can be viewed as a p-adic multiple of δm((q−1)n(p−1)
[p]q) =δm((q−1)np−n+1
qp−1)./square
An alternative (and more hands-on) proof of Corollary 3.2.1 5 is given in Ap-
pendix B; this alternative argument is also presented as [ Pet23 , Lemma 6.13].
Example 3.2.16. Let us describe the topological Sen operator on THH(Z/pn/X(p))
forn≥2(recall that p >2). This is equivalent to describing the Serre spectral
sequence in Z/pn-homology for the ﬁbration
S2p−1→Ω2Yn→ΩS2p+1×B(pn−1Z).
Note that this ﬁbration is an analogue of the ﬁbration (5).
It will be simpler to analyze the Serre spectral sequence in Zp-homology, since
all the diﬀerentials in the Serre spectral sequence in Z/pn-homology arise from the
Serre spectral sequence in Zp-homology. The analysis is similar to Remark 3.2.6;
the Serre spectral sequence runs
(31) E2
∗,∗=Zp/an}b∇acketle{tun/an}b∇acket∇i}ht⊗ZpZp[θ,ǫ]/ǫ2⇒π∗Zp[Ω2Yn],
whereǫlives in degree 2p−1andunlives in degree 2. There are several ways
to determine the diﬀerentials in this spectral sequence. Ou r approach will be to
describe the pattern of diﬀerentials by ﬁrst calculating π∗Zp[Ω2Yn]; in turn, we will
do this by computing π∗C∗(Ω2Yn;Zp). For this, we use the Serre spectral sequence
for the ﬁbration
BZ/pn−1→Ω2Yn→ΩS3.
SinceH∗(BZ/pn−1;Z)∼=Z[c]/pn−1cwith|c|= 2, the Serre spectral sequence
collapses on the E2-page, and we ﬁnd that π∗C∗(Ω2Yn;Zp)∼=Zp/an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[c]/(x−pn−1c)
with|x|= 2. (Ifn= 1, thenΩ2Yn≃ΩS3, and the cohomology ring is Zp/an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht.) For48 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
n≥2, this is isomorphic to Zp/an}b∇acketle{ty/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[c]/y, wherey=x−pn−1c. Indeed, observe that
ifn≥2, then
γj(y) :=j/summationdisplay
i=0pi(n−1)
i!ciγj−i(x)
is a well-deﬁned class in Zp/an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[c]/(x−pn−1c)sincephas divided powers in Zp, and
that these classes form a basis for Zp/an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[c]/(x−pn−1c)as aZp[c]-module. Recall
that in homological grading, there is an equivalence:
Zp/an}b∇acketle{ty/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/y≃Zp⊕/circleplusdisplay
n≥1Zp/n{γn(y)}[−2n],
which implies that if n≥2, then
Hi(Ω2Yn;Zp)∼=/braceleftBigg
Zp⊕/circleplustextk
j=1Zp/j{γj(y)ck−j}i= 2k≥0even
0 else.
Using the universal coeﬃcients theorem, we ﬁnd that if n≥2, then
πiZp[Ω2Yn]∼=/braceleftBigg
Zp i∈2Z≥0/circleplustextk
j=1Zp/j i= 2k−1.
The generator of π2jZp[Ω2Yn]is the linear dual to cj∈Zp/an}b∇acketle{ty/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[c]/y, while the gen-
erator ofπ2k−1Zp[Ω2Yn]which is killed by jis dual toγj(y)ck−j. Note that the
homotopy groups π∗Zp[Ω2Yn]areindependent ofnifn≥2(but the generators of
these groups do depend on n).
Let us now return to the Serre spectral sequence (31). Compar ison with the
Serre spectral sequence for the ﬁbration (5) (i.e., with the topological Sen operator
onTHH(Zp/X(p)); see Remark 3.1.6) forces the diﬀerentials in (31) to be give n by
(up top-adic units):
d2p(γpk(un)) =pn−1ǫk−1/productdisplay
j=1γpj(un)p−1=pnǫ∂up
n(γpk(un)), d2p(θj) =jpθj−1ǫ.
Reducing modulo pn, we get the topological Sen operator on THH(Z/pn/X(p))for
n≥2:
Θ :γpk(un)/mapsto→pn−1k−1/productdisplay
j=1γpj(un)p−1,Θ :θj/mapsto→jpθj−1.
Observe that this acts as “ pn∂up
n”. Of course, one can similarly deduce the action
of the topological Sen operator on THH(Z/pn/J(p)). This recovers the calculation
πjTHH(Z/pn) =

/circleplustextj
i=0Z/gcd(j,pn)evenj≥0,/circleplustextj
i=0Z/gcd(j,pn)oddj≥0,
0 j <0.
Another example of the topological Sen operator comes from s tudying complete
DVRs, where the relationship between THH relative to J(p)and the diﬀracted
Hodge complex predicted by Conjecture 3.1.14 can be seen dir ectly.
Example 3.2.17. LetRbe ap-torsionfree complete DVR of mixed characteristic
(0,p>0)whose residue ﬁeld kis perfect. Then we have
π∗THH(R/X(p))∼=HH∗(R/Zp)[θ]⊗ZpǫZp
∗,THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 49
and the map Θ :π∗THH(R/X(p))→π∗−2pTHH(R/X(p))sendsθj/mapsto→jpθj−1. To
compute the action of the topological Sen operator on the rem ainder of THH(R/X(p)),
it will be simpler to assume that T(1)is anE2-ring and work instead with THH(R/T(1));
this is merely cosmetic, and it is not diﬃcult to modify the be low argument to use
THH(R/X(p))instead. Then, we have π∗THH(R/T(1))∼=HH∗(R/Zp)[θ]. We will
compute THH(R)using the topological Sen operator on THH(R/T(1))and (16).
Letπ∈Rbe a uniformizer, let E(u)∈W(k)[[u]]be its minimal polynomial, and
letE′(u)∈W(k)[[u]]denote its derivative with respect to u. Recall that R=
W(k)[[u]]/E(u), thatW(k)is étale over Zp,π∗HH(W(k)[[u]]/W(k))∼=ΛW(k)[[u]](du)
with|du|= 1, andπ∗HH(R/W(k)[[u]])∼=R/an}b∇acketle{tσE/an}b∇acket∇i}ht, whereσE:=σ2(E(u)). The tran-
sitivity sequence for the composite W(k)→W(k)[[u]]→Rimplies that HH(R/W(k))≃
HH(R/Zp)is the ﬁber of a map R/an}b∇acketle{tσE/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Σ2R/an}b∇acketle{tσE/an}b∇acket∇i}htsendingγn(σE)/mapsto→E′(π)γn−1(σE).
In particular,
πnHH(R/Zp)∼=

R n = 0,
R/E′(π)n= 2j+1, j≥0,
0 else.
Let us denote the generator of π2j−1HH(R/Zp)byzj, so thatγj−1(σE)∈π2jΣ2R/an}b∇acketle{tσE/an}b∇acket∇i}ht
is sent tozjunder the boundary map Σ2R/an}b∇acketle{tσE/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →ΣHH(R/Zp). We then have

From this, we can describe the topological Sen operator on THH(R/T(1)). For this,
it will be useful to rephrase the above calculations somewha t, and useJ(p)instead
ofT(1). It is easy to compute that π∗THH(R/J(p))∼=HH∗(R/Zp)[x], wherexis

SinceHH(R/Zp)is the ﬁber of a map R/an}b∇acketle{tσE/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Σ2R/an}b∇acketle{tσE/an}b∇acket∇i}ht, it follows that there is a

where we have denoted the second map by ∇. The map ∇is given on homotopy
by a derivation, sending σE/mapsto→E′(π). Informally, THH(R/J(p))can be written as
R/an}b∇acketle{tσE/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[x]∇=0.
The topological Sen operator Θ : THH(R/J(p))→Σ2THH(R/J(p))is de-
scribed on homotopy by the operator on R/an}b∇acketle{tσE/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[x]sendingx/mapsto→nxn−1. Note
that this operator commutes with ∇(so that it does indeed deﬁne an operator on
π∗THH(R/J(p))). Observe that since THH(R)is the ﬁber of Θ : THH(R/J(p))→
Σ2THH(R/J(p)), andTHH(R/J(p))is the ﬁber of ∇:R/an}b∇acketle{tσE/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[x]→Σ2R/an}b∇acketle{tσE/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[x],50 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR

ﬁed with WCartHT
X×WCartHTSpec(Zp)∼=WCartHT
X×WCartHT×XX. In particular,
X/D∼=(G♯
m)X/G, i.e., the classifying stack of the group scheme G♯
a[E′(π)] ={a∈
G♯
a|E′(π)a= 0}. One can show from this description that the 2-periodiﬁcation of
the cohomology of the diﬀracted Hodge complex /hatwideΩ/D
R∼=Γ(BG♯
a[E′(π)];O)can be
identiﬁed with π∗THH(R/J(p))[x−1](which is additively the 2-periodiﬁcation of
π∗HH(R/Zp)), as predicted by Conjecture 3.1.14.
Note that the extensions in the following long exact sequenc e in homotopy for
(16) are always nontrivial:
··· →π2jTHH(R/T(1))→π2(j−p)THH(R/T(1))→π2j−1THH(R)→ (37)
π2j−1THH(R/T(1))→π2(j−p)−1THH(R/T(1))→π2j−2THH(R)→ ···
For example, when j=p, there is a long exact sequence
π2pTHH(R/T(1))∼=R·θ→π0THH(R/T(1))∼=R→π2p−1THH(R)→π2p−1THH(R/T(1))→0,
which in particular gives a short exact sequence
0→R/p→π2p−1THH(R)→R/E′(π)∼=π2p−1THH(R/T(1))→0.
Sinceπ2p−1THH(R)∼=R/pE′(π), this extension must be nontrivial.
3.3. Relation to the /tildewidep-de Rham complex. We now describe some addi-
tional calculations which give further evidence for Conjec ture 3.1.14.
Remark 3.3.1. Assume that Ris thep-completion of Zp[t]. Forthcoming work of
Arpon Raksit ([ Rak20 ]) shows that (a completion of) qΩRarises as the associated
graded of a motivic ﬁltration on HP(ku[t]/ku). In fact, Raksit studies HP(A[t]/A)
for a general E∞-ringAwith even homotopy groups.
Using Remark 3.3.1, one can show that (a completion of) /tildewidepΩRarises as the
associated graded of a motivic ﬁltration on HP(BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht). Moreover, the
class/tildewidepis identiﬁed as the image of v1/planck⋊ver2pi1p−1in the associated graded. For the sake of
completeness, let us explicitly compute π∗TP(Zp[t]/X(p)). As in Example 3.2.17,
it will be convenient to assume that T(1)is anEfr
2-ring and work instead with
THH(R/T(1)); again, this is merely cosmetic. We ﬁrst need the following r esult,
which is a special case of [ Rig21 , Proposition 3.1.1] and S1-equivariant Poincaré
duality for S1/µn.

Example 3.3.3. LetSbe the sphere spectrum. Recall that Zp[t]≃Zp⊗S[t],

S1-equivariant splitting. Similarly, we write THH(Zp[t]/T(1),(t))to denote the
ﬁber of the map THH(Zp[t]/T(1))→THH(Zp/T(1))induced by the augmentation
Zp[t]→Zp. ThenTHH(S[t],(t))≃/circleplustext

Using Theorem 2.2.4(a), we have τ≤2kpTHH(Zp/T(1))≃Zp[Jk(S2p)]. A simple
calculation using Theorem 2.2.4(a) shows that there is an is omorphism

we will denote /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/tildewidep. We conclude that
π∗(τ≤2kpTHH(Zp/T(1)))tZ/n∼=Zp[[/tildewidep]]((/planck⋊ver2pi1))/(/tildewidepk+1,/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht(/planck⋊ver2pi1)).

In particular, π∗HP(BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)is isomorphic to π∗TP(Zp[t]/T(1)).
The following is also a consequence of the forthcoming work o f Arpon Raksit

In particular, π∗HP(BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)∼=π∗TP(Zp[t]/T(1))is a2-periodiﬁcation
of a completion of H∗(/tildewidepΩZp[t]). This calculation leads to the following expectation
related to Conjecture 3.1.14:
Conjecture 3.3.5. LetRbe an animated Zp-algebra. Then TP(R/X(p))admits a
motivic ﬁltration F⋆
motTP(R/X(p))such that gri
motTP(R/X(p))≃ˆ∆R/Zp[[/tildewidep]][2i]⊗R
ǫR, whereˆ∆R/Zp[[/tildewidep]]is the Nygaard completion of /tildewidepΩR.
We now turn to a higher chromatic analogue of (part of) this pi cture.
Deﬁnition 3.3.6. LetRbe anE2-ring, and equip HH(R[t]/R) := THH(S[t])⊗R
with theS1-action inherited from THH(S[t])and the trivial action on R.
Warning 3.3.7. IfRis only an E2-ring, one cannot deﬁne Hochschild homology
relative toR; in particular, the notation HH(R[t]/R)is rather abusive. As explained
in [DHL+23, Corollary 2.9], if R′is anE1-R-algebra, then HH(R′/R)only exists
(and has a natural S1-action) when Ris aframedE2-ring14. In other words, if R
is merely an E2-ring, it would not be clear how to deﬁne HH(R[t]/R), had we not
known that R[t]admits a lift to the sphere spectrum. This leads to the follow ing
unfortunate warning: if Ris anEfr
2-ring with a nontrivial S1-action, then the
(more natural) circle action on HH(R[t]/R)arising via the S1-action onRcannot
be necessarily identiﬁed with the circle action from Deﬁnit ion 3.3.6. However, for
this article, we will only use the circle action from Deﬁniti on 3.3.6.

Then, deﬁne HPgr(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t1,···,tj]/BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)to be theS1-Tate construction of HH(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t1,···,tj]/BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)

nally to Zj
≥0-gradedBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-modules. Then, related to Conjecture 3.3.5, we
have the following result (which, when n= 0, is a very special case of the main
result of [ PV19 ]):
Proposition 3.3.8. There is a p-complete isomorphism of Zj

The map TPgr(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/X(pn))→TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/X(pn))is an equivalence
afterK(n)-localization.
14Suppose that Ris anE3-algebra, and Cis anR-linear∞-category. The choice of a
framed knot in R3also deﬁnes an En−3-map/integraltext
S1R→R, and hence allows one to deﬁne relative
Hochschild homology HH(C/R). However, this does not deﬁne an S1-action on HH(C/R)! Thanks
to Robert Burklund for this point.54 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Proof. For simplicity, we assume that j= 1and writetinstead oft1. In
the graded setting, we may commute the S1-Tate construction with the inﬁnite
direct sum (i.e., Lemma 3.3.2 is not necessary). It follows t hat there are graded
equivalences
TPgr(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/X(pn),(t))≃/circleplusdisplay

m≥1ΣBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/m(m).
The desired result now follows from Theorem 2.2.4(a). The se cond statement fol-
lows from the above equivalences and the fact that LK(n)(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/pm) = 0 by
Lemma 3.3.9. /square
The proof above used the following (well-known) fact.
Lemma 3.3.9. LetBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htdenote any form of the truncated Brown-Peterson spec-
trum. Then we have LK(n)(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/pm) = 0.
Proof. We ﬁrst observe that BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/pmdepends only on the p-completion
ofBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht; indeed, the obvious variant of [ NS18 , Lemma I.2.9] shows that if X
is a bounded-below spectrum with Z/pm-action, then XtZ/pmisp-complete, and
the mapXtZ/pm→(X∧
p)tZ/pmis an equivalence. Since all forms of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htare
equivalent after p-completion by [ AL17 ], we may therefore reduce to proving the
claim for a single form of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht.
To show that LK(n)(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/pm) = 0 , it suﬃces to show (since BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/pm
is anMU-module) that (π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/pm[1
vn])/(p,···,vn−1)∼=π∗k(n)tZ/pm[1
vn] = 0.
Recall that π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/pm∼=BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗((/planck⋊ver2pi1))/[pm](/planck⋊ver2pi1). We will work with the form of
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htsuch that the associated formal group law over π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htinduces the Honda
formal group law over π∗k(n). Then, the pm-series of the formal group law over
π∗k(n)satisﬁes [pm](/planck⋊ver2pi1) =vpnm−1

particular, vnis nilpotent in k(n)tZ/pm, so thatπ∗k(n)tZ/pm[1

Remark 3.3.10. In general,π∗HP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)looks like a completion of the
2-periodiﬁcation of the cohomology of the following two-ter m complex:
(40) BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗[[/planck⋊ver2pi1]][t]∇− →BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗[[/planck⋊ver2pi1]][t]dt,∇:tm/mapsto→[m]BP/angbracketleftn/angbracketright(/planckover2pi1)
/planckover2pi1tm−1dt.
This is a variant of the q-de Rham complex, and was ﬁrst considered by Arpon
Raksit (in forthcoming work). Note that an analogue of (40) c an be deﬁned for a
formal group law F(x,y)over any commutative ring A:
(41)FΩA[t]/A:=/parenleftBig
A[[/planck⋊ver2pi1]][t]∇− →A[[/planck⋊ver2pi1]][t]dt/parenrightBig
,∇:tm/mapsto→[m](/planckover2pi1)
/planckover2pi1tm−1dt;
we will study basic combinatorial properties of such comple xes in [ DM23 ]. After
base-changing to Q, the operator ∇can be characterized by the formula /planck⋊ver2pi1t∇=
expF(t∂tlogF(/planck⋊ver2pi1)).
We also have:
Proposition 3.3.11. IfCis a leftBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-linear∞-category, and C[t]denotes

so that
TPgr(C[t]/X(pn))≃TP(C/X(pn))(0)⊕/circleplusdisplay

Now, Conjecture 2.2.18 implies that THH( C/X(pn))tZ/pmis aBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/pm-module.
ButLK(n)(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/pm) = 0 by Lemma 3.3.9, so that LK(n)TPgr(C[t]/X(pn))≃
LK(n)TP(C/X(pn)), as desired. /square
Example 3.3.12. Letn= 0, and suppose Cis the∞-category of quasicoherent
sheaves on an Fp-schemeX. Then Proposition 3.3.11 says that the map TPgr(A1×
X)→TP(X)is a rational equivalence. This is generally not true in the n on-graded
setting.
Remark 3.3.13. Note that the functor LK(0)TPisnotnil-invariant; the same
is true of the functor LK(n)TP(−/T(n))onBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-algebras. Indeed, [ Hor20 ,
Theorem 1.1] says that the map LK(0)TP(Fp[t]/tk)→LK(0)TP(Fp)≃QtS1
pis an
isomorphism if and only if kis a power of p. We can also see this at the level
of algebra by calculating the crystalline cohomology of Fp[t]/tk. IfRdenotes the
p-completion of the PD-envelope of the quotient map Zp[t]→Fp[t]/tk(so thatR=

p), then [ BO78 , Theorem 7.23] implies that Γcrys((Fp[t]/tk)/Zp)
is quasi-isomorphic to the de Rham complex Ω•
R/Zp. Note that Ris additively
isomorphic to the p-completion of/circleplustext
0≤i≤k−1/circleplustext

Since the derivative oftkj+i
j!is(kj+i)tkj+i−1
j!, which simpliﬁes to ktk(j−1)+k−1
(j−1)!
wheni= 0, we ﬁnd that π0Γcrys((Fp[t]/tk)/Zp)∼=Zp, and

For instance, suppose k=p. Thenpj+i+1≡i+1 (modp), which is never zero
since0≤i<p−1. Therefore, the second summand is zero since pj+i+1is ap-

However, if kis not a power of p, the second summand contains a non-torsion piece;
for example, if k= 2andpis odd, the second summand contains the p-completion
of/circleplustext
m≥0Z/pm, which is non-torsion.
Example 3.3.14. Letn= 1; then, Proposition 3.3.11 says that Conjecture 2.2.18
implies that up to a Nygaard-type completion, LK(1)TPgr(R[t]/X(p))∼− →LK(1)TP(R/X(p))
forRbeing an E1-Zp-algebra. In the non-graded setting, this is generally not t rue;
this is in contrast to [ LMMT20 , Corollary 4.24] (for instance), which says that
K(1)-local algebraic K-theory is A1-invariant on connective K(1)-acyclic ring spec-
tra (in particular, on connective E1-Zp-algebras).56 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Let us now pivot somewhat to a slightly diﬀerent topic, worki ng at the famed
primep= 2. Then/tildewidepΩR=qΩR, and there is an interesting action of Z/2⊆Z×
2
onqΩRsendingq/mapsto→q−1. If we view qas the Chern class (in K-theory) of the
tautological line bundle on CP∞, this corresponds to the action of Z/2onCP∞
given by complex conjugation. This motivates the following discussion:
Remark 3.3.15. We expect that most of the results and conjectures in this ar-
ticle continue to hold with Z/2-equivariance, where “real” topological Hochschild
homology THHRis interpreted to mean the construction described in [ DMPR17,
HHK+20]. Recall that Z/2acts onSU(n)by complex conjugation; we will denote
thisZ/2-space by SU(n)R. Letσ(resp.ρ=σ+1) denote the sign representation
(resp. regular representation), and if Xis aZ/2-space, let ΩσXdenote the space
of mapsMap(Sσ,X). There is a Z/2-equivariant Eρ-map
ΩσSU(n)R≃ΩρBSU(n)R→ΩρBSUR≃BUR,
which equips its Thom spectrum X(n)Rwith the structure of an Eρ-ring. One can
show that the equivariant Quillen idempotent on MURrestricts to an idempotent
onX(n)R, and we will write T(n)Rto denote the resulting summand of X(2n)R.
Moreover, ΦZ/2T(n)R≃y(n)as2-localE1-algebras.
We then expect:
Conjecture 3.3.16. The following are true:
(a)T(n)Radmits the structure of an Eρ⋊U(1)R-algebra, and X(2n)Rsplits
as a direct sum of shifts of T(n)Rsuch that the inclusion T(n)R→
X(2n)Rof the unit summand is a map of Eρ-algebras. In particular,
THHR(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htR/T(n)R)exists and admits an U(1)R-action15.
(b) LetBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htRdenote the Real truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum. Then
there are equivalences

Example 3.3.17. Note that [ DMPR17 , Theorem 5.18] and [ HHK+20, Theorem
A.1] prove (42) for n= 0and (43) for n= 1, respectively.
Remark 3.3.18. We expect that BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htZ/2
R⊗T(n)is concentrated in even degrees.
Proposition 3.3.19. The equivalence (42)is true forn= 1.
Proof sketch. This can be proved analogously to Theorem 2.2.4(a) for n= 1
using the equivariant Toda ﬁber sequence
Sρ+σ→ΩSρ+1/an}b∇acketle{tρ+1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →ΩS2ρ+1
of [Dev23a , Equation 7.1].16Indeed, recall from [ Dev23a , Example 7.1.3] that
X(2)Ris the Thom spectrum of the map ΩσSρ+σ→BGL1(S)detecting/tildewideη∈
πσS. By an argument similar to [ BCS10 ], this implies that THHR(X(2)R)≃
X(2)R[Sρ+σ]. Therefore:
THHR(Z/X(2)R)≃Z[ΩSρ+1/an}b∇acketle{tρ+1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht]⊗X(2)R[Sρ+σ]X(2)R
≃Z[ΩSρ+1/an}b∇acketle{tρ+1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht]⊗Z[Sρ+σ]Z≃Z[ΩS2ρ+1],
where the last equivalence uses the equivariant Toda ﬁber se quence. /square
Example 3.3.20. Let us note some additional evidence for Conjecture 3.3.16( a):
ifXis aZ/2-space, then the coﬁber sequence (Z/2)+→S0→Sσof spaces
implies that (ΩσX)Z/2is equivalent to the ﬁber of the canonical map XZ/2→
X. In particular, since (SU(n)R)Z/2= SO(n), we see that (ΩσSU(n)R)Z/2≃
Ω(SU(n)/SO(n)). Since geometric ﬁxed points preserves colimits, this impl ies that
ΦZ/2X(n)Ris the Thom spectrum of the map
(ΩσSU(n)R)Z/2≃Ω(SU(n)/SO(n))→Ω(SU/SO)≃BO≃BUZ/2
R.
SinceΦZ/2T(n)R≃y(n)as2-localE1-algebras, Conjecture 3.3.16(a) would imply
thatΦZ/2X(2n)R(i.e., the Thom spectrum of the map Ω(SU(n)/SO(n))→BO)
16See also [ Dev23a , Theorem 7.2.1], which says that Zis the Thom spectrum of a map
ΩρS2ρ+1→BGL1(X(2)R)whose bottom cell detects v1∈πρX(2)R.58 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
is a direct sum of shifts of y(n)such that the inclusion y(n)→ΦZ/2X(2n)Rof the
unit summand is an E1-map. This is indeed true, and was proved in [ Yan92 ].
Example 3.3.21. The strongest evidence for Conjecture 3.3.16(d) is the foll ow-
ing. It follows from [ Dev23a , Construction 7.1.1] that there is a map ΩSnρ−1→
BGL1(X(n−1)R)whose Thom spectrum is X(n)R. The same construction used
to prove Theorem 3.1.4 then shows that for any Z/2-equivariant Eσ-X(n)R-algebra
R, there is an equivariant coﬁber sequence
(44)THHR(R/X(n−1)R)→THHR(R/X(n)R)→ΣnρTHHR(R/X(n)R),
where the second map is a Z/2-equivariant analogue of the topological Sen op-
erator. It is not diﬃcult to see that given the ﬁrst half of Con jecture 3.3.16(a),
Conjecture 3.3.16(d) can be easily proved using the constru ction of Theorem 3.1.4.
For example, we have X(2)R=T(1)R, and the coﬁber sequence of (44) is
precisely Conjecture 3.3.16(d). For R=Z, (44) becomes a coﬁber sequence
Z[ΩSρ+1/an}b∇acketle{tρ+1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht]≃THHR(Z)→THHR(Z/X(2)R)≃Z[ΩS2ρ+1]≃/circleplusdisplay

m≥1Σ2mρZ.
A version of this ﬁber sequence was in fact already studied in [HHK+20, Lemma
A.3].
Remark 3.3.22. Conjecture 3.3.16(a) and Conjecture 3.3.16(d) together im ply
that
π∗ΦZ/2THHR(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htR)≃F2[t,σ2(vn−1),σ(vj−1)|1≤j≤n]/(σ(vj)2),
where|t|= 2n=|σ2(vn−1)|and|σ(vj−1)|= 2j−1. This can also be proved
unconditionally using methods similar to that of [ DMPR17 , Theorem 5.23], by
writing
ΦZ/2THHR(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htR)≃ΦZ/2BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htR⊗BP/angb∇acketleftn−1/angb∇acket∇ightRΦZ/2BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htR,
and using that π∗ΦZ/2BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htR∼=F2[t].
Note that if we assume Conjecture 3.3.16(c), then THHR(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htR/T(n−
1)R)≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htR[/tildewideKn]; the conjectural equivalence /tildewideKZ/2
n=Kn−1then gives an
equivalence
(45) ΦZ/2THHR(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htR/T(n−1)R)≃ΦZ/2BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htR[Kn−1].
Observe that
π∗ΦZ/2BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htR[Kn−1]∼=F2[t,x,e]/e2,
where|x|= 2nand|y|= 2n−1. For instance, when n= 1, there is an equivalence
(ΩSρ+1/an}b∇acketle{tρ+1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)Z/2= ΩS2, and (45) reduces to the equivalence
ΦZ/2THHR(Z)≃ΦZ/2Z[ΩS2]≃(τ≥0FtS1

3.4. Aside: the Segal conjecture. In this section, we make some brief
remarks regarding the Segal conjecture; the reader is refer red to [ HW20 , Section
4] and [ Mat21 , Section 5] for a discussion of its algebraic interpretatio n and a
review of the literature on this topic.
Deﬁnition 3.4.1. AnE∞-ringRis said to satisfy the Segal conjecture if the
cyclotomic Frobenius THH(R)→THH(R)tZ/pis an equivalence in large degrees.THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 59
Example 3.4.2. LetRbe a commutative Fp-algebra. If Ris Cartier smooth in
the sense of [ KM21 , Section 2] and Ωn
R/Fp= 0forn≫0, thenRsatisﬁes the Segal
conjecture in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.4.1 (see [ Mat22 , Corollary 9.5]).
For instance, suppose R=kis a ﬁeld of characteristic p>0. ThenTHH(k)≃
HH(k/Fp)[σ]as a module over THH(Fp)≃Fp[σ], andπiHH(k/Fp) = 0 fori >
logp[k:kp] = dimkΩ1
k/Fp. This implies that the localization map THH(k)→
THH(k)[1
σ]≃ϕTHH(k)tZ/pis an equivalence in degrees >logp[k:kp]−2.
Example 3.4.3. The proof of [ HW20 , Theorem 4.3.1 and Corollary 4.2.3] can be
used to show that the map THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)⊗BP/angb∇acketleftn−1/angb∇acket∇ightFp→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)tZ/p⊗BP/angb∇acketleftn−1/angb∇acket∇ight

Note that 2pn−1
p−1−nis also precisely the shift appearing in Mahowald-Rezk dual ity
forBP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht(see [MR99 , Corollary 9.3]).
Remark 3.4.4. Assume Conjecture 2.1.9, so that we can deﬁne the THH of a left
T(n)-linear∞-category relative to T(n). Since we do not know if THH relative to
T(n)admits the structure of a cyclotomic spectrum (presumably i t does not), it
does not seem possible to state a direct analogue of Deﬁnitio n 3.4.1 in this con-
text. However, recall that if kis a perfect ﬁeld of characteristic p >0andRis
an animated k-algebra, the cyclotomic Frobenius ϕ: THH(R)→THH(R)tZ/pis
the Frobenius-linear map given by inverting σ∈π2THH(k): this is a consequence
of the observation that the map ϕ: THH(k)→THH(k)tZ/pis given by compos-
ing the localization THH(k)→THH(k)[σ−1]with a Frobenius-linear equivalence
THH(k)[σ−1]≃FrobTHH(k)tZ/p.
This observation motivates the following terminology: we s ay that an E1-
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-algebraRsatisﬁes the “ T(n)-Segal conjecture” if the base-change of the
localization map THH(R/T(n))→THH(R/T(n))[θ−1
n]alongBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Fp=
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/(p,···,vn−1)is an equivalence in large degrees. Note that if n= 1,
this is equivalent to saying that the p-completion of the map THH(R/T(1))→
THH(R/T(1))[θ−1]is an equivalence in large degrees. One can similarly say tha t an
E1-Zp-algebraRsatisﬁes the “ J(p)-Segal conjecture” if the map THH(R/J(p))→
THH(R/J(p))[x−1]is an equivalence in large degrees.
Proposition 3.4.5. If we assume Conjecture 2.1.9, the localization map
γ: THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[x1,···,xd]/T(n))→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[x1,···,xd]/T(n))[θ−1
n]
is an equivalence in degrees >d−2pnafter base-changing along BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Fp.
In particular, the ﬂat polynomial algebra BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[x1,···,xd]satisﬁes the T(n)-
Segal conjecture.
Proof. WriteT:= THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))for notational simplicity. Using
(38), we have
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/T(n))[θ−1]≃T[θ−1]⊕/circleplusdisplay
n≥1T[θ−1]⊗(S1/µn)+.
Since the map T→T[θ−1]is an equivalence in degrees >−2pnafter base-changing
alongBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Fp, the mapT⊗(S1/µn)+→T[θ−1]⊗(S1/µn)+is an equiv-
alence in degrees >−2pn+1after base-changing along BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Fp. Because
the mapγ: THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/T(n))→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/T(n))[θ−1]preserves60 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
the summands, we see that γis an equivalence in degrees >−2pn+1after base-
changing along BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Fp. Inducting on the number of variables, we ﬁnd
that the map γis an equivalence in degrees > d−2pnafter base-changing along
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Fp, as desired. /square
Remark 3.4.6. Whend= 0, Proposition 3.4.5 should be compared to [ HW20 ,
Theorem 4.3.1]. In fact, we expect it is possible to recover t heir result using Propo-
sition 3.4.5. We also note the following variant. Let R:= BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t1,···,td]
denote the ﬂat polynomial E2-BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-algebra on classes tiin even degrees
(i.e., the base-change of the E∞-MU-algebra MU[t1,···,td]along the E3-map
MU→BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht). The argument of Proposition 3.4.5 then shows that after
base-change along the composite R→BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht →Fp, the localization map
γ: THH(R/T(n))→THH(R/T(n))[θ−1
n]is an equivalence in degrees >−2pn+/summationtextd
j=1(|tj|+1). Whenn= 0, this is [ HW20 , Corollary 4.2.3].
Proposition 3.4.7. LetRbe ap-torsionfree discrete commutative ring such that
R/pis regular Noetherian. Suppose LΩn
R= 0forn > d. Then Conjecture 3.1.14
implies that Rsatisﬁes the J(p)-Segal conjecture: in fact, the map THH(R/J(p))→
THH(R/J(p))[x−1]is an equivalence in degrees >d−2.
Proof. Recall that Conjecture 3.1.14 asserts that THH(R/J(p))has a ﬁl-
tration such that gri

logical degrees ≥i+ 1, so that the coﬁber of gri(γ)is concentrated in degrees
≤2i−(i+1) =i−1. Moreover, the hypothesis that LΩn
R= 0forn > d implies
thatγinduces an equivalence on gri
motfori≥d. Combining these observations
gives the desired statement (see also the proof of [ Mat22 , Corollary 9.5]). /square
3.5. Aside: Cartier isomorphism. In this section, we study a topolog-
ical analogue of the Cartier isomorphism for the two-term co mplexes from Re-
mark 3.3.10; we will study basic algebraic properties of the se complexes in future
work. To avoid dealing with completion issues, we use the fol lowing (see Warn-
ing 3.3.7 for a remark about the notation HH(R[t]/R)):
Deﬁnition 3.5.1. LetRbe anE2-ring. The polynomial E1-R-algebraR[t] =R[N]
acquires a natural Z-grading, and we will write HH(R[t]/R)≤mto denote the graded
leftR-module given by truncating HH(R[t]/R) :=R⊗THH(S[t])in weights ≥m+1.
Explicitly, HH(R[t]/R)≤mis equivalent to R⊕/parenleftBig/circleplustext
1≤n≤mR⊗(S1/µn)+/parenrightBig
.
Lemma 3.5.2. IfX∈SpBS1, the following composite is an equivalence:
XtZ/p⊗(S1/µn)+∼− →(X⊗(S1/µn)+)tZ/pψ− →(X⊗(S1/µnp)+)tZ/p.
Moreover, if p∤m, then(X⊗(S1/µm)+)tZ/p= 0.
Proof. Ifϕ: (S1/µn)+→((S1/µnp)+)hZ/pdenotes the unstable Frobenius
(sendingx/mapsto→x1/p), the coﬁber of the composite
ψ: (S1/µn)+→((S1/µnp)+)hZ/p→(S1/µnp)+
has induced Z/p-action, where (S1/µn)+and((S1/µnp)+)hZ/pare equipped with
the trivial Z/p-action. Therefore, the canonical map XtZ/p⊗(S1/µn)+→(X⊗THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 61
(S1/µn)+)tZ/pis an equivalence (since (S1/µn)+is a ﬁnite spectrum with trivial
Z/p-action). This gives the ﬁrst claim. Finally, if p∤m, then the Z/p-action on
S1/µmis free, so that (X⊗(S1/µm)+)tZ/p= 0, as desired. /square
Proposition 3.5.3 (Cartier isomorphism) .LetRbe anE2-ring. Then:
(a) There is an S1-equivariant map C: HH(RtZ/p[t]/RtZ/p)→HH(R[t]/R)tZ/p,
whereHH(R[t]/R)tZ/pis endowed with the residual S1/µp-action and HH(RtZ/p[t]/RtZ/p)
is endowed with the diagonal S1-action arising from the S1-action on HH
and the residual S1/µp-action on RtZ/p. Moreover, the map Csends
t/mapsto→tp.
(b) For each m≥1, the map Cinduces an equivalence C≤m: HH(RtZ/p[t]/RtZ/p)≤m∼− →
(HH(R[t]/R)≤mp)tZ/p.
Proof. Recall that there is an equivalence HH(R[t]/R)≃R⊗THH(S[t]).
Since the Z/p-Tate construction is lax symmetric monoidal, we obtain the mapC
via the composite
HH(RtZ/p[t]/RtZ/p)≃RtZ/p⊗THH(S[t])
id⊗ϕ− −− →RtZ/p⊗THH(S[t])tZ/p
→(R⊗THH(S[t]))tZ/p≃HH(R[t]/R)tZ/p.
For eachm≥1, there is an equivalence

/circleplusdisplay
1≤n≤mR⊗(S1/µn)+

Since the maps ϕ: (S1/µn)+→((S1/µnp)+)hZ/pdeﬁne the Frobenius on THH(S[t])≃
S⊕/circleplustext
n≥1(S1/µn)+, we see from Lemma 3.5.2 that for each m≥1, the map C≤m

The left-hand side is HH(RtZ/p[t]/RtZ/p)≤m, and the right-hand side is (HH(R[t]/R)≤mp)tZ/p.
/square
Remark 3.5.4. WhenRis anE∞-ring, the map C: HH(RtZ/p[t]/RtZ/p)→
HH(R[t]/R)tZ/pof Proposition 3.5.3 can also be constructed using (a simple case
of) [Law21 , Theorem 1.3]. The cited result says the following. Suppose kis
anE∞-ring, so that the Tate-valued Frobenius k→ktZ/padmits an extension
THH(k)→ktZ/pto anS1-equivariant map of E∞-rings. IfAis anE1-k-algebra,
andMis anA-bimodule in Modk, then there is a relative Tate diagonal
ktZ/p⊗THH(k)THH(A,M)→THHk(A,M⊗Ap)tZ/p,
whereTHHkdenotesTHH relative tok. To construct C, takek=RandA=M=
k[t]. Then
ktZ/p⊗THH(k)THH(A,M)≃ktZ/p⊗THH(S0[t])≃HH(ktZ/p[t]/ktZ/p),62 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
sinceTHH(A,M)≃THH(A)≃THH(S0[t])⊗THH(k). Similarly, THHk(A,M⊗Ap)≃
HH(A/k), and it is straightforward to check that Lawson’s relative T ate diagonal
agrees with the map C.
One advantage of the construction of Cin Proposition 3.5.3 is that it is man-
ifestlyS1-equivariant, and does not rely on Rbeing an E∞-ring. More generally,
one ﬁnds that if Cis a stable ∞-category and Ris anyE2-ring, the cyclotomic
Frobenius on THH( C)deﬁnes anS1-equivariant map C: HH(C⊗RtZ/p/RtZ/p)→
HH(C⊗R/R)tZ/pwhich generalizes the map of Proposition 3.5.3. This map is
furthermore an equivalence if Cis smooth and proper.
Remark 3.5.5. In Proposition 3.5.3, the map C: HH(RtZ/p[t]/RtZ/p)→HH(R[t]/R)tZ/p
is itself almost an equivalence: the main issue is that the ca nonical map
colimm(HH(R[t]/R)≤mp)tZ/p→(colimmHH(R[t]/R)≤mp)tZ/p≃HH(R[t]/R)tZ/p
may not be an equivalence. However, Proposition 3.5.3 impli es that the graded map
Cgr: HH(R[t]/R)tZ/p→HH(R[t]/R)tZ/pis itself an equivalence.
Remark 3.5.6. IfRis a complex-oriented E2-ring, let [p](/planck⋊ver2pi1)∈π−2RhS1denote the
p-series of the formal group law over R. IfM∈LModBS1
R, then it is not diﬃcult to
show that there is an equivalence MtS1/[p](/planckover2pi1)
/planckover2pi1∼− →MtZ/p. (Although certainly well-
known, the only reference in the literature for a statement i n this generality seems to
be [HRW22 , Lemma 6.2.2].) In particular, HH(R[t]/R)tZ/p≃HP(R[t]/R)/[p](/planckover2pi1)
/planckover2pi1,
so that Proposition 3.5.3 and Remark 3.5.5 imply that there i s anS1-equivariant
graded equivalence
C: HH(RtZ/p[t]/RtZ/p)→HP(R[t]/R)/[p](/planckover2pi1)
/planckover2pi1≃HH(R[t]/R)tZ/p.
In future work, we will show that if Ris further assumed to be an E∞-ring and Cis
aR-linear∞-category, then the (RtZ/p)hS1≃(RtS1)∧
p-module (THH( C)⊗THH(R)
RtZ/p)hS1behaves as a noncommutative analogue of Lη[p](/planckover2pi1)//planckover2pi1applied to HP(C/R).
Here,/planck⋊ver2pi1∈π−2RhS1is the complex-orientation of R, and[p](/planck⋊ver2pi1)//planck⋊ver2pi1∈π0RtS1is the
quotient of the p-series of the associated formal group law.
Remark 3.5.7. There is no reason to restrict to polynomial rings in a single vari-
able in the equivalence of Proposition 3.5.3(b); we leave th e details of the resulting

Example 3.5.8. LetR=Z. ThenZtZ/pis anE∞-Z-algebra, and has homotopy
groups given by Fp((/planck⋊ver2pi1))with|/planck⋊ver2pi1|= 2. Therefore, ZtZ/p≃FtS1
pasE2-rings17, and
17In fact, they are equivalent as E∞-rings. Although seemingly innocuous, even the weaker
claim that ZtZ/padmits the structure of an E∞-Fp-algebra is surprisingly diﬃcult to prove
from ﬁrst principles (see [ NS18 , Remark IV.4.17]). One might try to argue as follows: since
p= 0∈π0ZtZ/p, there is a map from the free E∞-algebra with p= 0toZtZ/p. However,
oddly enough, the free E∞-algebra with p= 0isnotanE∞-Fp-algebra; this dashes any hopes
of proving that ZtZ/pis anE∞-Fp-algebra through this argument.
More generally, the free En-algebra Rwithp= 0is not an En-Fp-algebra unless n= 2:
indeed, applying the En-cotangent complex to the composite Fp→R→FpofEn-algebra maps
shows that LEn
Fpis a retract of Fp⊗RLEn
R≃Fp. This forces LEn
Fp=Fp, i.e.,Fpwould be
built from the sphere by attaching a single En-cell in degree 1– but this is impossible, since

Proposition 3.5.3 (combined with Remark 3.5.5) specialize s to the statement that
there is a Frobenius-linear equivalence
C: HH(Fp[t]/Fp)((/planck⋊ver2pi1))≤m≃HH(FtS1
p[t]/FtS1
p)≤m∼− →(HH(Z[t]/Z)≤mp)tZ/p.
Note that HH(Z[t]/Z)tZ/p≃HP(Z[t]/Z)/p≃TP(Fp[t])/p. Since the HKR theo-
rem implies that HH(Fp[t]/Fp)tS1is a2-periodiﬁcation of the Hodge cohomology
ofA1
Fp, andHP(Z[t]/Z)/pis a2-periodiﬁcation of the de Rham cohomology of
A1
Zpmodulop(which is the de Rham cohomology of A1
Fp), one can view Cas a
topological analogue of the Cartier isomorphism for the aﬃn e line. It reduces to
the usual Cartier isomorphism on graded pieces. In this case , the statement of
Proposition 3.5.3 should also be compared to [ Kal08, Kal17, Mat20 ]. Taking
homotopy ﬁxed points for the S1-equivariance of Cfrom Proposition 3.5.3(a), we
obtain a Frobenius-linear equivalence
(46) ChS1: (HH(ZtZ/p[t]/ZtZ/p)hS1)≤m∼− →((HH(Z[t]/Z)≤mp)tS1)∧
p.
More succinctly, there is a graded equivalence
(Cgr)hS1: HH(ZtZ/p[t]/ZtZ/p)hS1∼− →HPgr(Z[t]/Z)∧
p.
Using the HKR ﬁltration on HH(Z[t]/Z), one can prove that HH(ZtZ/p[t]/ZtZ/p)hS1
admits a ﬁltration whose graded pieces are given by even shif ts ofLηpΓdR(Zp[t]/Zp)≃
LηpΓcrys(Fp[t]/Zp). We will explain this in greater detail in a future article. S ince
HP(Zp[t]/Zp)≃TP(Fp), (46) can be regarded as a 2-periodiﬁcation of the “Cartier
isomorphism” LηpΓcrys(Fp[t]/Zp)≃Γcrys(Fp[t]/Zp)for the crystalline cohomology
ofFp[t](see [BO78 , Theorem 8.20] for the general case).
Example 3.5.9. LetR= ku. Thenπ∗kutZ/p∼=Z[ζp]((/planck⋊ver2pi1)), and it is expected that
this lifts to an equivalence kutZ/p≃Z[ζp]tS1ofE∞-rings (see also Example 3.5.11
below). Nevertheless, there isan equivalence kutZ/p≃Z[ζp]tS1ofE2-rings (one can
show this by using [ Mao20 , Theorem 1.19]; thanks to Arpon Raksit for pointing
this out). Therefore, Proposition 3.5.3 and Remark 3.5.5 gi ve an equivalence
C: HH(Z[ζp][t]/Z[ζp])((/planck⋊ver2pi1))≤m≃HH(Z[ζp]tS1[t]/Z[ζp]tS1)≤m∼− →(HH(ku[t]/ku)≤mp)tZ/p.
Note that HH(ku[t]/ku)tZ/p≃HP(ku[t]/ku)/[p]q. Here, we identify[p]Gm(/planckover2pi1)
/planckover2pi1∈
π0kutS1∼=Z[[q−1]]with theq-integer[p]q.
By the HKR theorem, one can view HH(Z[ζp][t]/Z[ζp])((/planck⋊ver2pi1))as a2-periodiﬁcation
of the Hodge cohomology of A1
Zbase-changed along the map Z→Z[ζp]. Similarly,
the aforementioned work of Raksit (see [ Rak20 ] and Remark 3.3.1, as well as
Lemma 3.3.4) implies that HP(ku[t]/ku)can be viewed as a 2-periodiﬁcation of the
q-de Rham complex of Z[t]. Since killing [p]q∈Z[[q−1]]amounts to specializing
qto a primitive pth root of unity, one can view Proposition 3.5.3 as a topologi cal
analogue of the Cartier isomorphism for the q-de Rham complex of the aﬃne line
(see, e.g., [ Sch17 , Proposition 3.4]).
Taking homotopy ﬁxed points for the S1-equivariance of Cfrom Proposition 3.5.3(a),
we obtain an equivalence
(47) ChS1: (HH(kutZ/p[t]/kutZ/p)hS1)≤m∼− →((HH(ku[t]/ku)≤mp)tS1)∧
p.
More succinctly, there is a graded equivalence
(Cgr)hS1: HH(kutZ/p[t]/kutZ/p)hS1∼− →HPgr(ku[t]/ku)∧
p.64 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
In future work, we show that Raksit’s ﬁltration on HP(ku[t]/ku)can be reﬁned
to construct a ﬁltration on HH(kutZ/p[t]/kutZ/p)hS1whose graded pieces are given
by even shifts of Lη[p]qqΩZp[t]. Then, (47) can be regarded as a 2-periodiﬁcation
of the “Cartier isomorphism” φ∗
Zp[[q−1]]qΩZp[t]≃Lη[p]qqΩZp[t]for theq-de Rham
cohomology of Zp[t]. (See [ BS19 , Theorem 1.16(4)] applied to the q-crystalline
prism(Zp[[q−1]],[p]q).)
Remark 3.5.10. Example 3.5.9 admits a mild generalization. Namely, if kuZ/pn−1
denotes the strict ﬁxed points (so kuZ/pn−1=τ≥0(kuhZ/pn−1)), then one can cal-
culateπ∗(kuZ/pn−1)tZ/p∼=π∗Zp[ζpn]tS1. One can show that this can be extended
to an equivalence (kuZ/pn−1)tZ/p≃Zp[ζpn]tS1ofE2-rings. Proposition 3.5.3 and
Remark 3.5.5 give a graded equivalence
C: HH(Z[ζpn][t]/Z[ζpn])((/planck⋊ver2pi1))∼− →HH(kuZ/pn−1[t]/kuZ/pn−1)tZ/p.
Here, the action of Z/ponHH(kuZ/pn−1[t]/kuZ/pn−1) = THH(S[t])⊗kuZ/pn−1is
via the diagonal action on THH andkuZ/pn−1. In this case, one can therefore
view Proposition 3.5.3 as a topological analogue of the Cart ier isomorphism for
Hodge-Tate cohomology relative to the prism (Zp[[q1/pn−1−1]],[p]q)of the aﬃne
line.
Example 3.5.11. More generally, let R= BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. As recalled in Remark 2.2.16,
[AMS98 , Proposition 2.3] proved that there is an isomorphism π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/p∼=
π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1, and this was conjectured to lift to an equivalence of spectr a in
[DJK+86, Conjecture 1.2]. If we assume that there is in fact an equiva lence
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/p≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1ofE2-rings, Proposition 3.5.3 and Remark 3.5.5 give
an equivalence
C: HH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)((/planck⋊ver2pi1))≤m∼− →(HH(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)≤mp)tZ/p.
Therefore, Proposition 3.5.3 in this case can be viewed as an analogue of the Cartier
isomorphism for the aﬃne line in the setting of “ vn-adic Hodge theory”. Taking
homotopy ﬁxed points for the S1-equivariance of Cfrom Proposition 3.5.3(a), we
obtain an equivalence
(48)
ChS1: (HH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/p[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/p)hS1)≤m∼− →((HH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)≤mp)tS1)∧
p.
More succinctly, there is a graded equivalence
(Cgr)hS1: HH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/p[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}httZ/p)hS1∼− →HPgr(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)∧
p.
Note that Conjecture 2.2.18 in particular implies that if T(n)admits the structure of
anEfr
2-ring, then HP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)is closely related to TP(BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[t]/T(n))
by Proposition 3.3.8. In this form, (48) holds when BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htis replaced by any
complex-oriented E2-ringR. As in the preceding examples, we believe that when R
is connective, this can be regarded as a 2-periodiﬁcation of a “Cartier isomorphism”
for the two-term complex (41). See [ DM23 ] for further discussion.THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 65

4.1. Incarnation of the topological Sen operator over MFG.In Sec-
tion 3, we showed that the descent spectral sequence of Remar k 2.2.12 admits a
generalization given by the topological Sen operator (Theo rem 3.1.4). This has an
incarnation over MFG, as we now explain. The analogues of Theorem 2.2.4, The-
orem 3.1.4, etc., that we discuss in this section are useful f or making topological
predictions since the calculations involved are easier.
Recollection 4.1.1 (Even ﬁltration) .LetF⋆
ev: CAlg→CAlg(Spﬁl)be the even
ﬁltration of [HRW22 ]: ifCAlgevdenotes the full subcategory of CAlg spanned
by theE∞-rings with even homotopy, then F⋆
evis the right Kan extension of the
functorτ≥2⋆: CAlgev→CAlg(Spﬁl)along the inclusion CAlgev֒→CAlg. Note
that sinceτ≥2⋆is lax symmetric monoidal and F⋆
evis deﬁned by a right Kan ex-
tension, it is also a lax symmetric monoidal functor. We will need the following
result from [ HRW22 ]: ifRis anE∞-ring such that MU⊗R∈CAlgev, then
F⋆
evRisp-completely equivalent to the underlying ﬁltered E∞-ring of its Adams-
Novikov tower ν(R)∈Synev
MU(Sp) = ModTot(τ≥2⋆MU⊗•+1)(Spﬁl). (Also see [ Pst18,
GIKR18 ].) In this case, the associated graded Hopf algebroid (MU∗(R),MU∗(MU⊗
R))deﬁnes a stack over BGm. IfRis complex-oriented, then this stack is isomor-
phic toSpec(π∗R)/Gm, where the Gm-action encodes the grading on π∗R.
Observation 4.1.2. In order to deﬁne the stack /tildewideMRassociated to the graded Hopf
algebroid (MU∗(R),MU∗(MU⊗R)), one does not need Rto be an E∞-ring: it only
needs to admit the structure of a homotopy commutative ring s uch that MU∗(R)
is concentrated in even degrees. This perspective is explai ned in Hopkins’ lecture
in [DFHH14 , Chapter 9]. In particular, one can deﬁne the stack associat ed to
X(n): this is the moduli stack of graded formal groups equipped wi th a coordinate
of order ≤n, and strict isomorphisms between them. (See, e.g., [ Mil19 , Section
2].)
Variant 4.1.3. We will ﬁnd it convenient to work with the p-typical variant of
the graded Hopf algebroid (MU∗(R),MU∗(MU⊗R)). Namely, if Ris ap-local
homotopy commutative ring such that BP∗(R)is concentrated in even degrees,
then we will write MRto denote the graded stack associated to the graded Hopf
algebroid (BP∗(R),BP∗(BP⊗R)). For example, MT(n)is the moduli stack of p-
typical graded formal groups equipped with a coordinate up t o order≤pn+1−1;
byp-typicality, this is further isomorphic to the moduli stack ofp-typical graded
formal groups equipped with a coordinate up to order ≤pn. In particular, MS0is
isomorphic to the moduli stack MFGofp-typical graded formal groups. Similarly, if
Ris ap-local complex-oriented homotopy commutative ring, then MRis isomorphic
toSpec(π∗R)/Gm.
Example 4.1.4. The unit map S0→MUinduces the map /tildewideMMU∼=Spec(MU ∗)/Gm→
/tildewideMS0which describes the ﬂat cover of the moduli stack of graded fo rmal groups
given by the graded Lazard ring. This map exhibits /tildewideMS0as the quotient of
Spec(MU ∗)/Gmby the group scheme Spec(π∗(MU⊗MU))/Gm. Note that MU⊗
MU≃MU[BU] ; sinceπ∗Z[BU]is the coordinate ring of the big Witt ring scheme,
we see that Spec(π∗(MU⊗MU))/Gmis a lift of the big Witt ring scheme to
Spec(MU ∗)/Gm. Similarly, MS0=MFGis the quotient of MBP= Spec(BP ∗)/Gm
by a lift of the p-typical Witt ring scheme WtoSpec(BP ∗)/Gm.66 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Remark 4.1.5. IfA→Bis a map of p-localE∞-rings such that MU∗(A)and
MU∗(B)are even, then there is an induced map MB→MAof graded stacks. Recall
thatTHH(B/A)is the geometric realization of the simplicial A-algebraB⊗A•+1.
Applying F⋆
evlevelwise to B⊗A•+1∈Fun(∆op,CAlgA)produces an Adams-Novikov
analogue of the Bökstedt spectral sequence:
π∗HH(MB/MA)⇒π∗gr•
evTHH(B/A).
In particular, note that HH(MB/MFG)is an approximation to gr•
evTHH(B). For
this spectral sequence to exist, it is not necessary that AandBbeE∞-rings: for
example, it suﬃces that A→Bbe a map of p-localE2-rings such that MU∗(A)
andMU∗(B)are even, and such that THH(B/A)is bounded below and has even
MU-homology. Then, gr•
evTHH(B/A)must be interpreted as the associated graded
of the Adams-Novikov ﬁltration on THH(B/A); see [HRW22 , Corollary 1.1.6].
Example 4.1.6. LetMs
FGdenote the total space of the canonical line bundle over
MFG(determined by the map MFG→BGm). IfRis ap-quasisyntomic ring, then
[BMS19 , Theorem 1.12] and Remark 4.1.5 give a spectral sequence
π∗HH(Spec(R)/Ms
FG)⇒π∗N∗ˆ∆R[2∗].
Indeed,MR= Spec(R)/Gm∼=Spec(R)×BGm, so that the underlying R-algebra
ofHH(MR/MFG)isHH(Spec(R)/Ms
FG).
Example 4.1.7. The complex orientation BP→BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htinduces a map MBP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight→
MBPwhich factors the structure map MBP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight→MFG. Explicitly, we have the
following composite map of stacks over BGm:
Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm→Spec(BP ∗)/Gm→MFG.
Taking cotangent complexes gives the following transitivi ty coﬁber sequence in
Modgr
BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight∗:
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗⊗BP∗LSpec(BP ∗)/MFG→LBP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight∗/MFG→LBP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight∗/BP∗.
SinceBP∗/(vn+1,vn+2,···)∼=BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗, observe that LBP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight∗/BP∗is a free BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗-
module generated by classes σ(vn+1),σ(vn+2),···. Similarly, the discussion in Ex-
ample 4.1.4 implies that LSpec(BP ∗)/MFGis a freeBP∗-module generated by classes
d(ti). From this, one can deduce that LSpec(BP /angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight∗)/Gm/MFGis a free BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗-
module generated by classes σ(vj)withj≥n+1andd(ti)withi≥1. By the HKR
theorem,π∗HH(Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm/MFG)is isomorphic to SymBP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight∗(LBP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight∗/MFG[1]),
which can be identiﬁed as
π∗HH(Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm/MFG)∼=BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗/an}b∇acketle{tσ2vj|j≥n+1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht⊗BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight∗ΛBP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight∗(dti|i≥1).
Sincevjlives in degree 2pj−2and weight pj−1, the class σ2vjlives in degree
2pj=|vj|+2and weight pj; similarly, since tilives in degree 2pi−2and weight
pj−1, the classdtilives in degree 2pi−1and weight pj.
Example 4.1.8. The same discussion for the following composite map of stack s
overBGm
Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm→Spec(BP ∗)/Gm→MT(n)
shows that LSpec(BP /angb∇acketleftn−1/angb∇acket∇ight∗)/Gm/MT(n)is a free BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗-module generated by
classesσ(vj)withj≥nandd(ti)withi≥n+ 1. Therefore, the HKR theorem
implies that π∗HH(Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm/MT(n))is isomorphic to a symmetricTHH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 67
algebra over BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗on classesσ2(vi)fori≥n, andd(ti)fori≥n+ 1.
Explicitly,
π∗HH(Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm/MT(n))∼=BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗/an}b∇acketle{tσ2vj|j≥n/an}b∇acket∇i}ht⊗BP/angb∇acketleftn−1/angb∇acket∇ight∗ΛBP/angb∇acketleftn−1/angb∇acket∇ight∗(dti|i≥n+1).
The classσ2vjlives in degree 2pj=|vj|+2and weight pj, and the class dtilives
in degree 2pi−1and weight pj. This mirrors the calculation of the E2-term of the
Bökstedt spectral sequence in Proposition 2.2.14.
In fact, one can recover Theorem 2.2.4 in this way by running t he Adams-
Novikov-Bökstedt spectral sequence (Remark 4.1.5) and usi ng theE2-Dyer-Lashof
argument of Proposition 2.2.14 to resolve the extension pro blems on the E∞-page.
We use the term “recover” in a very weak sense here: the diﬀere ntials in the Adams-
Novikov-Bökstedt spectral sequence are forced by the diﬀer entials in the usual Bök-
stedt spectral sequence (Proposition 2.2.14). Explicitly , we have
dp−1(γj(σ2vm)) =γj−p(σ2vm)dtm
modulo decomposables, and the spectral sequence collapses on theEp-page. There
are topologically determined extensions (σ2vm)p=σ2vm+1modulo decomposables,
which give an isomorphism (as implied by Theorem 2.2.4)

Recollection 4.1.9. LetYbe a scheme, and let q:X→A1×Ybe a morphism,
so thatXis a scheme over Yvia the projection pr :A1×Y→Y. Then the
transitivity coﬁber sequence in QCoh(X)runs
q∗LA1×Y/Y→LX/Y→LX/A1×Y.
Sinceq∗LA1×Y/Yis a free OX-module of rank 1generated by dt(wheretis a
coordinate on A1), we obtain a coﬁber sequence
dR∗
X/Y→dR∗
X/A1×Y∇− →dR∗

X/Y=/circleplustext
i≥0(∧iLX/Y)[−i]denotes the underlying derived commuta-
tive algebra of the downwards-shearing of SymOX(LX/Y[1](1)) . The map ∇is
the Gauss-Manin connection for the morphism q. Note that ∇satisﬁes Griﬃths
transversality: it sends the nth piece of the Hodge ﬁltration to the (n−1)st piece.
Remark 4.1.10. Observe that if qis taken to be the morphism Y→A1×Ygiven
by the inclusion of the origin into A1, thendRY/A1×Yisp-completely isomorphic
to the divided power algebra OY/an}b∇acketle{tt/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. Using the fact that dRY/Y∼=OY, it is not
diﬃcult to see that the Gauss-Manin connection ∇must sendγj(t)/mapsto→γj−1(t)dt.
Here, we set γ−1(t) = 0. In particular, ∇is a PD-derivation.
Example 4.1.11 (The topological Sen operator and MFG).The mapT(n−1)→
T(n)of homotopy commutative rings induces a map MT(n)→MT(n−1)of graded
stacks, which sends a p-typical graded formal group equipped with a coordinate
up to order ≤pnto the underlying p-typical graded formal group equipped with a
coordinate up to order ≤pn−1. The map MT(n)→MT(n−1)is an aﬃne bundle:
in other words, it exhibits MT(n−1)as the quotient of MT(n)by the group scheme
G(pn−1)
a/GmoverBGm, whereG(pn−1)
a denotes the aﬃne line with Gm-action of
weightpn−1. This follows, for instance, from [ Pet17 , Reduction of Lemma 3.2.368 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
to Lemma 3.2.7]. If f:X→MT(n)is a stack over MT(n), the transitivity coﬁber
sequence in QCoh(X)is given by
f∗LMT(n)/MT(n−1)→LX/MT(n−1)→LX/MT(n).
SinceMT(n)→MT(n−1)is aGa-bundle, we see that LMT(n)/MT(n−1)is a free
OMT(n)-module of rank 1generated by the class dti. It follows that there is a
coﬁber sequence
(49) HH(X/MT(n−1))→HH(X/MT(n))Θmot− −− →Σ2pn,pnHH(X/MT(n))
of quasicoherent sheaves on X, whereΣn,wdenotes a shift by degree nand weight
w. As indicated by the notation, the map Θmotbehaves as an analogue on MFGof
the topological Sen operator of Theorem 3.1.4; more precise ly, it is the eﬀect of the
topological Sen operator at the level of the E2-page of the Adams-Novikov-Bökstedt
spectral sequence of Remark 4.1.5. Moreover, the discussio n in Recollection 4.1.9
says that Θmotcan be understood as an analogue of the Gauss-Manin connecti on.
Example 4.1.12. The topological Sen operator on THH(Zp/J(p))∼=Zp[x]sends
xj/mapsto→jxj−1, so that the action of the Sen operator is precisely the actio n ofG♯
a
onGa= SpecZp[x]given by∂x:Zp[x]→Zp[x]. Therefore, there is a p-complete
graded isomorphism gr•
evTHH(Zp)∼=Γ(Ga/G♯
a;O). In the same way, one can argue
that there is a p-complete isomorphism gr•
evTHH(Zp)tZ/p∼=Γ(Gm/G♯
m;O).
This perspective is related to the stacky approach to Hodge- Tate cohomology
à la [Dri22, BL22a ] in the following way. By [ Dri22 , Proposition 3.5.1], there is
an isomorphism Ga/G♯
a∼=GdR
a; similarly, Gm/G♯
m∼=GdR
m. Therefore:
gr•
evTHH(Zp)∼=Γ(GdR
a;O), (50)
gr•
evTHH(Zp)tZ/p∼=Γ(GdR
m;O). (51)
Sincegr•
evTHH(Zp)tZ/pis supposed to arise as the cohomology of the total space
Tot(OWCartHT{1})of the Breuil-Kisin twisting line bundle OWCartHT{1}overWCartHT,
the isomorphism (51) suggests that Tot(OWCartHT{1})∼=GdR
m. In turn, this sug-
gests that WCartHTshould be GdR
m/Gm=BG♯
m. This is indeed true: it is precisely
[BL22a , Theorem 3.4.13].
Similarly, gr•
evTHH(Zp)is supposed to arise as the cohomology of the total
space of the Breuil-Kisin twisting line bundle over the “ext ended Hodge-Tate locus”
∆′
0in Drinfeld’s Σ′. (The stack ∆′
0is deﬁned in [ Dri22 , Section 5.10.1].) In
[Bha22 ], the stack Σ′is denoted by Spf(Zp)N, and one might therefore denote
∆′
0bySpf(Zp)N,HT. The isomorphism (50) then suggests that the total space of
the Breuil-Kisin line bundle over Spf(Zp)N,HTisGdR
a, which in turn suggests that
Spf(Zp)N,HTshould be GdR
a/Gm∼=Ga/(G♯
a⋊Gm). This is indeed true: it is
precisely [ Dri22 , Lemma 5.12.4].
Had we worked with the evenly faithfully ﬂat cover gr•
evTHH(Zp)→gr•
evTHH(Zp/S[t])
(wheret/mapsto→p) instead, the stack associated to the even ﬁltration on THH(Zp)would
in fact be presented by (and is therefore isomorphic to) GdR
a/Gm.
Variant 4.1.13. One can also study the stack MJ(p)associated to the Efr
2-ring
J(p). It is not diﬃcult to show that the morphism MJ(p)→MFGexhibitsMJ(p)as
aGm-bundle over MFG; for example, the ﬁber product Spec(MU ∗)/Gm×MFGMJ(p)
is isomorphic to Spec(π∗(MU⊗J(p)))/Gm, but there is an equivalence of E2-MU-
algebras MU⊗J(p)≃MU[t±1]with|t|= 0.THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 69
SinceMJ(p)is aGm-bundle over MFG, descent in Hochschild homology is
controlled by a Gauss-Manin connection. If Yis a scheme and q:X→Gm×Yis
a morphism, then there is a coﬁber sequence
dR∗
X/Y→dR∗
X/Gm×Y∇− →dR∗
X/Gm×Ydlog(t).
IfXis a stack over MJ(p), we then obtain a coﬁber sequence
HH(X/MFG)→HH(X/MJ(p))Θmot− −− →Σ2,1HH(X/MJ(p))
of quasicoherent sheaves on X. This is an analogue on MFGof the topological Sen
operator of (17).
Remark 4.1.14. Suppose that T(1)admits the structure of an Efr
2-ring (this is
true atp= 2). The unit map on T(1)deﬁnes a map TP(Zp)→TP(Zp/T(1)).
SinceTP(Zp/T(1))is concentrated in even degrees by Theorem 2.2.4, one can
deﬁne the motivic ﬁltration on TP(Zp/T(1))using the double-speed Postnikov
ﬁltration. Under the isomorphism π∗TP(Zp/T(1))∼=π∗BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1∼=Zp[[/tildewidep]]tS1, one
can view gr0of the motivic ﬁltration TP(Zp/T(1))asZp[[/tildewidep]]. Recall that TP(Zp)
is a homotopical analogue of the Cartier-Witt stack WCart Zpfrom [BL22b ]. One
can then view the map TP(Zp)→TP(Zp/T(1))as an analogue of the following
map induced by the q-de Rham point:
ρ/tildewidepdR: SpfZp[[/tildewidep]]∼=(SpfZp[[q−1]])/F×
p→(SpfZp[[q−1]])/Z×
pρqdR− −− →WCart Zp.
This map classiﬁes the prism (Zp[[/tildewidep]],(/tildewidep)), and can reasonably be called the /tildewidep-de
Rham point.
As explained in the end of the introduction to [ HRW22 ], one hopes that the
unit mapS0→TP(Zp)induces the map WCart Zp→MFGclassifying Drinfeld’s
formal group over WCart Zp= Σfrom [Dri21 ] on the associated graded of the
motivic ﬁltration. If Conjecture 2.2.18 were true (i.e., th ere is an equivalence
TP(Zp/T(1))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1of spectra), the resulting unit map S0→TP(Zp/T(1))→
BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1would just be the unit of the E∞-ringBP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1. SinceBP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}htis complex-
oriented, the formal group over π0BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}httS1∼=Zp[[/tildewidep]]must be isomorphic to the
formal group of BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht, i.e., thep-typiﬁcation of the multiplicative formal group. In
particular, the aforementioned expectation about the form al group over WCart Zp
and its relation to TP(Zp)would predict that the pullback of Drinfeld’s formal
group over WCart Zpalong the map ρ/tildewidepdRis thep-typiﬁcation of the multiplica-
tive formal group over Zp[[/tildewidep]]. This is indeed true, and was proved in [ Dri21 ,
Section 2.10.6]. This lends further evidence to the idea tha t the map TP(Zp)→
TP(Zp/T(1))is a homotopical analogue of the /tildewidep-de Rham point of WCart Zp.
4.2. Comparing THHrelative to T(n)andT(n+ 1).Recall from Theo-
rem 2.2.4 that π∗(THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n+1))⊗BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ightBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)is (additively) equiva-
lent to the “subalgebra” BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗[θp
n−1]ofπ∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))∼=BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗[θn−1].
This picture has an analogue over MFG, as we now explain. We ﬁrst need a simple
calculation.
Remark 4.2.1. LetRbe a commutative ring, and let x∈Rbe a regular element.
Then there is a p-completed equivalence dR∗
R[t]/x/R≃R[t]/an}b∇acketle{tx′/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/x⊗R[t]/xΛR[t]/x(dt)
with|x′|= 0. Indeed, this follows from combining the observation that R[t]/x∼=
R[t]⊗RR/xwith the following p-completed equivalences: dR∗
R[t]/R≃ΛR[t](dt),70 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
dR∗
R/x/R≃R/an}b∇acketle{tx′/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/x. Similarly, there is an equivalence HH(R[t]/x/R)≃R[t][S1×
CP∞]/x.
Example 4.2.2. Letin−1:Z(vn−1)֒→MT(n)denote the closed substack cut
out by the global section vn−1∈H0(MT(n);OMT(n)). Iff:X→MT(n)is a
stack over MT(n), letXvn−1=0denote the pullback of Xalongin−1, and letf:
Xvn−1=0→Z(vn−1)denote the structure morphism. Then i∗
n−1HH(X/MT(n)) =
HH(Xvn−1=0/Z(vn−1)). In the case X= Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm, there is an isomor-
phismXvn−1=0= Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm. We will now relate HH(Xvn−1=0/Z(vn−1))
toHH(Xvn−1=0/MT(n−1))by calculating HH(Z(vn−1)/MT(n−1)).
Recall from Example 4.1.11 that there is a Ga-bundleMT(n)→MT(n−1). Note
thatLMT(n)/MT(n−1)is a free OMT(n)-module of rank 1generated by a class d(tn),
and thatLZ(vn−1)/MT(n)is a free OZ(vn−1)-module of rank 1generated by a class
σ2(vn−1). Applying Remark 4.2.1, we ﬁnd that
(52)π∗HH(Z(vn−1)/MT(n−1))∼=OZ(vn−1)/an}b∇acketle{tσ2(vn−1)/an}b∇acket∇i}ht⊗OZ(vn−1)ΛOZ(vn−1)(dtn).
We therefore see that HH(Xvn−1=0/MT(n−1))a subquotient of the tensor product of
HH(Xvn−1=0/Z(vn−1))andf∗HH(Z(vn−1)/MT(n−1))∼=OXvn−1=0/an}b∇acketle{tσ(vn−1)/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[dtn]/(dtn)2.
Let us now take fto be the morphism Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm→MT(n). TheE2-
page of the Adams-Novikov-Bökstedt spectral sequence for THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n−
1))is given by
E2
∗,∗= BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗/an}b∇acketle{tσ2vj|j≥n−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht⊗BP/angb∇acketleftn−1/angb∇acket∇ight∗ΛBP/angb∇acketleftn−1/angb∇acket∇ight∗(dtj|j≥n),
and the extensions on the E∞-page are given by (σ2vj)pn−j=σ2vn. The above dis-
cussion therefore shows that f∗HH(Z(vn−1)/MT(n−1))precisely detects the “bot-
tom piece” of this E2-page, i.e., the subalgebra BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗/an}b∇acketle{tσ2vn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht ⊗BP/angb∇acketleftn−2/angb∇acket∇ight∗
ΛBP/angb∇acketleftn−2/angb∇acket∇ight∗(dtn). Therefore, the preceding calculation of HH(Z(vn−1)/MT(n−1))
gives one explanation for why π∗(THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))⊗BP/angb∇acketleftn−1/angb∇acket∇ightBP/an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)is
(additively) equivalent to the “subalgebra” BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗[θp
n−2]ofπ∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n−
1))∼=BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗[θn−2].
Remark 4.2.3. We can extend the analysis of Example 4.2.2 further. Let 0≤
j≤n−1, and letij,···,n−1:Z(v[j,n))֒→MT(n)denote the closed substack
cut out by the global sections vj,···,vn−1∈H0(MT(n);OMT(n)). Iff:X→
MT(n)is a stack over MT(n), letXvj,···,vn−1=0denote the pullback of Xalong
i, and letf:Xvj,···,vn−1=0→Z(v[j,n))denote the structure morphism. Then
i∗
j,···,n−1HH(X/MT(n))is equivalent to HH(Xvj,···,vn−1=0/Z(v[j,n))). In the case
X= Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm, there is an isomorphism Xvj,···,vn−1=0= Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm.
We can now relate HH(Xvj,···,vn−1=0/Z(v[j,n)))toHH(Xvj,···,vn−1=0/MT(j))by
calculating HH(Z(v[j,n))/MT(j)).
We claim that there is an isomorphism
HH(Z(v[j,n))/MT(j))∼=OZ(v[j,n))/an}b∇acketle{tσ(vi)|j≤i≤n−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht⊗OZ(v[j,n))ΛOZ(v[j,n))(dti|j+1≤i≤n)
To prove this, we will use descending induction on j; the base case j=n−1was
studied in Example 4.2.2. For the inductive step, suppose we know the result for
j+1. Letij:Z(v[j,n))→Z(vj+1,···,vn−1)denote the closed substack cut outTHH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 71
byvj. Then there are isomorphisms
HH(Z(v[j,n))/Mvj=0
T(j+1))∼=i∗
jHH(Z(vj+1,···,vn−1)/MT(j+1))
∼=OZ(v[j,n))/an}b∇acketle{tσ2(vi)|j+1≤i≤n−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht⊗OZ(v[j,n))ΛOZ(v[j,n))(dti|j+2≤i≤n)
Recall that Example 4.2.2 gives an isomorphism between HH(Mvj=0
T(j+1)/MT(j))and
OMvj=0
T(j+1)/an}b∇acketle{tσ2(vj)/an}b∇acket∇i}ht⊗O
Mvj=0
T(j+1)ΛO
Mvj=0
T(j+1)(dtj+1). The desired calculation of HH(Z(v[j,n))/MT(j))
is now a simple computation with the transitivity sequence f or the composite
Z(v[j,n))→Mvj=0
T(j+1)→MT(j).
LetX= Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm, and letf:X→Z(v[j,n))be the structure map.
Then the above discussion implies that HH(Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm/MT(j))is iso-
morphic to the tensor product of f∗HH(Z(v[j,n))/MT(j))andHH(Spec(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗)/Gm/Z(v[j,n))).
This gives the E2-page of the Adams-Novikov-Bökstedt spectral sequence com put-
ingπ∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(j))(see Remark 4.1.5), and one can run this spectral se-
quence as in Proposition 2.2.14. If BP/an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htadmits the structure of an E3-algebra,
there are extensions σ2(vi)p=σ2(vi+1)modulo decomposables on the E∞-page of
this spectral sequence.
LetT(n)/v[j,n)denoteT(n)/(vj,···,vn−1). Sinceθj∈π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(j))
is represented by σ2(vj), we ﬁnd that THH(T(n)/v[j,n)/T(j))is (additively) equiva-
lent to asT(n)[θj]/(v[j,n),θpn−j
j). (See Remark 4.2.5 for a more topological perspec-
tive on this observation.) This discussion provides an alge braic perspective on why
π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))/v[j,n)is (additively) equivalent to as the “subalgebra” of
π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(j))generated by θpn−j
j.
Remark 4.2.4. In topology, Example 4.2.2 plays out as follows, if we assume18
Conjecture 2.1.9. Let n≥1. We begin by observing that T(n)/vn−1is the
Thom spectrum of an E1mapµ: ΩJp−1(S2pn−1)→BGL1(T(n−1)); in par-
ticular,T(n)/vn−1admits the structure of an E1-ring. To see this, we ﬁrst de-
ﬁne the map µas follows. There is a map S2pn−1→B2GL1(X(pn−1))which
detects the class vn−1∈π2pn−1−2X(pn−1), which naturally extends to a map
Jp−1(S2pn−1)→B2GL1(X(pn−1))since we are working p-locally. Therefore, we
obtain an E1-mapΩJp−1(S2pn−1)→BGL1(X(pn−1)). The projection X(pn−1)→
T(n−1)is a map of E2-rings by Conjecture 2.1.9, and therefore induces an
E1-mapBGL1(X(pn−1))→BGL1(T(n−1)). Composition with the E1-map
ΩJp−1(S2pn−1)→BGL1(X(pn−1))produces the desired map µ. The fact that
the Thom spectrum of µcan be identiﬁed with T(n)/vn−1can be proved directly
using (54) below. It follows from this discussion that there is an equivalence
THH(T(n)/vn−1/T(n−1))≃T(n)[Jp−1(S2pn−1)]/vn−1.
Moreover, under the equivalence THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n−1))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[ΩS2pn−1+1]
of Theorem 2.2.4(a), the map THH(T(n)/vn−1/T(n−1))→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n−
1))induced by the map T(n)/vn−1→BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}htis given by the skeletal inclu-
sion ofJp−1(S2pn−1)→ΩS2pn−1+1. The projection THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n−1))→
18There is an unconditional variant of the following discussi on, obtained by replacing T(n)
withX(pn+1−1). However, this comes at the cost of adding the spaces ∆ninto the mix.72 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))/vn−1can be identiﬁed with the eﬀect on BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-chains
of the James-Hopf map ΩS2pn−1+1→ΩS2pn+1. Therefore, the EHP sequence
Jp−1(S2pn−1)→ΩS2pn−1+1→ΩS2pn+1
shows that THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))/vn−1is (additively) equivalent to precisely as
the “subalgebra” of THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n−1))generated by θp
n−1. The above calcu-
lation of THH(T(n)/vn−1/T(n−1))is a topological incarnation of the calculation
ofHH(Z(vn−1)/MT(n−1))in Example 4.2.2. Indeed, the Adams-Novikov-Bökstedt
spectral sequence (see Remark 4.1.5) runs
(53)E2
∗,∗=π∗HH(Z(vn−1)/MT(n−1))⇒π∗gr•
evTHH(T(n)/vn−1/T(n−1)),
and theE2-page is given by (52). Again, one can establish analogues of the Bökstedt
diﬀerentials (6) in the Adams-Novikov-Bökstedt spectral s equence, and thereby
obtain an alternative approach to the above calculation of THH(T(n)/vn−1/T(n−
1)).
Remark 4.2.5. Let us continue to assume Conjecture 2.1.9, and let 0≤j≤n−1.
Recall that T(n)/v[j,n)denoteT(n)/(vj,···,vn−1). Recall that
(54) H∗(T(n)/v[j,n);Fp) =/braceleftBigg
F2[ζ2
1,···,ζ2
j,ζj+1,···,ζn]p= 2,
Fp[ζ1,···,ζn]⊗ΛFp(τj,···,τn−1)p>2.
It is natural to ask if the discussion in Remark 4.2.4 extends to a description of
THH(T(n)/v[j,n)/T(j)), paralleling Remark 4.2.3. This is an ill-posed question,
since it is not clear that T(n)/v[j,n)admits the structure of an E1-algebra. Nev-
ertheless, if T(n)/v[j,n)did admit the structure of an E1-T(j)-algebra, then an
analysis similar to Theorem 2.2.4 shows that
THH(T(n)/v[j,n)/T(j))≃T(n)[Jpn−j−1(S2pj)]/v[j,n).
This is the topological analogue of the calculation of Remar k 4.2.3. Under the equiv-
alenceTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(j))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[ΩS2pj+1]of Theorem 2.2.4(a), the map
THH(T(n)/v[j,n)/T(j))→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(j))induced by the map T(n)/v[j,n)→
BP/an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htis given by the skeletal inclusion of Jpn−j−1(S2pj)→ΩS2pj+1. The pro-
jection
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(j))→THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))/v[j,n)
can be identiﬁed with the eﬀect on BP/an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-chains of the James-Hopf map ΩS2pj+1→
ΩS2pn+1. Therefore, the EHP sequence
Jpn−j−1(S2pj)→ΩS2pj+1→ΩS2pn+1
shows that π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))/v[j,n)is (additively) equivalent to precisely
the “subalgebra” of π∗THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(j))generated by θpn−j
j.
SinceTHH(T(n)/v[j,n)/T(j))≃T(n)[Jpn−j−1(S2pj)]/v[j,n), one expects T(n)/v[j,n)
to have an E1-cell structure over T(j)described by the cell structure of Jpn−j−1(S2pj).
Although we do not know how to prove this unconditionally, it is not diﬃcult to
show if we further assume [ Dev23a , Conjectures D and E]. In this case, [ Dev23a ,
Corollary B] says that there is a map f: Ω2S2pj+1→BGL1(T(j))which detects
vj∈π2pj−2T(j)on the bottom cell of the source, such that the Thom spectrumTHH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 73
offis a form of BP/an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. Let19fn,j: ΩJpn−j−1(S2pj)→BGL1(T(j))denote
the composite of fwith the E1-mapΩJpn−j−1(S2pj)→Ω2S2pj+1. Then the Thom
spectrum of fn,jis equivalent to T(n)/v[j,n)as aT(j)-module. This is not quite an
“E1-cell structure” for T(n)/v[j,n), sincefn,jis not an E1-map; nevertheless, this
construction of T(n)/v[j,n)suﬃces to calculate THH(T(n)/v[j,n)/T(j)).
Example 4.2.6. IfRis anE2-algebra which is an E1-T(n)-algebra, one can loosely
interpret the above discussion as saying that the square
(55)
R[Jpn−j−1(S2pj)]≃R⊗T(n)THH(T(n)/v[j,n)/T(j)) /d47/d47
/d15/d15THH(R/v[j,n)/T(j))
/d15/d15
R /d47/d47THH(R/T(n))/v[j,n)
exhibits the top-right corner as the “tensor product of the t op-left and bottom-
right corners”. Note that the homotopy of the top-left corne r isR[θj]/θpn−j
j. The
bottom-right corner should be thought of as THH(R/v[j,n)/T(n)/v[j,n)), although
it is diﬃcult to make this picture precise (since T(n)/v[j,n)does not admit the
structure of an E2-algebra).
For instance, if R= BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht, then the square (55) says that the square
(56)
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[Jpn−j−1(S2pj)] /d47/d47
/d15/d15THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(j))≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[ΩS2pj+1]
/d15/d15
R /d47/d47THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))/v[j,n)≃BP/an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[ΩS2pn+1]
exhibits the top-right corner as the tensor product of the to p-left and bottom-right
corners. This is essentially the observation that the map THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(j))→
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))/v[j,n)sendsθm
j/mapsto→0unlesspn−j|m, in which case θm

θm/pn−j
n . This therefore explains the similarity between THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(n))
andTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(j))given by Theorem 2.2.4(a).
Remark 4.2.7. As mentioned before, the lack of structure on the objects inv olved
above make it diﬃcult to use the above picture to understand t he multiplicative
structure on THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht); but it does point to a plan of attack. Namely,
one can attempt to understand the even ﬁltration on THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)/v[0,n)by
considering the natural map THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)/v[0,n)→THH(Fp). It is not hard to
see that this map is an eﬀ cover, so that the stack associated t o the even ﬁltration
onTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)/v[0,n)is the quotient of the scheme associated to the even
ﬁltration on THH(Fp)by a certain group scheme. The scheme associated to the
even ﬁltration on THH(Fp)is precisely Ga, and the above discussion suggests that
the stack associated to the even ﬁltration on THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)/v[0,n)is isomorphic
19In Remark 4.2.4, we described the map fn,n−1without assuming [ Dev23a , Conjectures D
and E]. It is generally not possible to describe fn,jsimilarly if j < n−1: although there is a map
S2pj→B2GL1(T(j))which detects vj∈π2pj−2T(j), there are p-local obstructions to extending
alongS2pj→Jpn−j−1(S2pj)ifn−j >1. These obstructions can be viewed as the E2-Browder
brackets on vj; [Dev23a , Conjecture E] implies that these Browder brackets can be co mpatibly
trivialized.74 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
toGa/W[Fn]; this is also suggested by work of Lee in [ Lee22 ]. We hope to study
this in future work joint with Jeremy Hahn and Arpon Raksit. T o this end, we set
up some groundwork for future investigation of this stack in Appendix C, where we
study some basic properties of W[Fn].
Remark 4.2.8. The calculation of THH(T(n)/v[j,n)/T(j))in Remark 4.2.5 shows
that more is true: if n≥k−1, the structure of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htas anE1-X(pk)-algebra (i.e.,
THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(k))) mirrors the structure of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−k/an}b∇acket∇i}htas anE1-algebra over the
sphere (i.e., THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−k/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)).
Remark 4.2.9. Note that the Thom spectrum of the map fn,0has been stud-
ied in [ MRS01 ], where it was denoted y(n). Just as the y(n)describe a ﬁltra-
tion ofy(∞) =FpbyE1-algebras, the spectra T(n)/v[j,n)describe a ﬁltration of
BP/an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht. For instance, it is not diﬃcult to show that for j≤k≤n−1, the spec-
trumT(n)/v[j,n)isTel(k)-acyclic. Therefore, if T(n)/v[j,n)admits the structure
of anE1-ring, the same argument as [ LMMT20 , Corollary 4.15] implies that the
mapK(T(n)/v[j,n))→K(BP/an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)is anTel(k)-equivalence for j≤k≤n−1.
SinceK(BP/an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)isTel(k)-locally contractible for k≥j+1, the only interesting
case isk=j; in this case, we ﬁnd that the maps
K(T(j+1)/vj)→K(T(j+2)/(vj,vj+1))→ ··· →K(BP/an}b∇acketle{tj−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)
are allTel(j)-equivalences.
Remark 4.2.10. SinceT(n)/v[j,n)is closely related to T(j)by Remark 4.2.5,
it is natural to wonder if there is a relationship between T(n)/v[j,n)andT(n+
k)/v[j,n+k), in a manner compatible with their relationship to T(j). By Remark 4.2.4,
T(n+k)/v[n,n+k)is the Thom spectrum of a map ΩJpk−1(S2pn)→BGL1(T(n)). It
follows that if T(n)/v[j,n)admits the structure of an E1-ring, thenT(n+k)/v[j,n+k)
is the Thom spectrum of a map ΩJpk−1(S2pn)→BGL1(T(n)/v[j,n)). As men-
tioned in Remark 4.2.5, if we further assume [ Dev23a , Conjectures D and E], the
spectrumT(n)/v[j,n)(resp.T(n+k)/v[j,n+k)) is the Thom spectrum of a map
ΩJpn−j−1(S2pj)→BGL1(T(j))(resp.ΩJpn+k−j−1(S2pj)→BGL1(T(j))).
The relationship between the two presentations of T(n+k)/v[j,n+k)(as a Thom
spectrum over T(n)/v[j,n)and overT(j)) is explained by the following observation
in unstable homotopy theory: there is a ﬁbration20
(57) Jpm−1(S2d)→Jpm+k−1(S2d)H− →Jpk−1(S2dpm).
Indeed, applying (57) when m=n−jandd=pj, we obtain a ﬁbration of E1-
spaces:
ΩJpn−j−1(S2pj)→ΩJpn+k−j−1(S2pj)H− →ΩJpk−1(S2pn).
The composite of fn+k,j: ΩJpn+k−j−1(S2pj)→BGL1(T(j))with the map ΩJpn−j−1(S2pj)→
ΩJpn+k−j−1(S2pj)isfn,j: ΩJpn−j−1(S2pj)→BGL1(T(j)). Therefore, [ Dev23a ,
Proposition 2.1.6] implies that there is a map fn+k,j: ΩJpk−1(S2pn)→BGL1(T(n)/v[j,n))
20To construct the ﬁbration (57), recall that there is an EHP se quence
Jpm−1(S2d)→ΩS2d+1H− →ΩS2dpm+1.
By dimension considerations, the canonical map Jpm+k−1(S2d)→ΩS2d+1factors through
Jpm+k−1(S2d)→Jpk−1(S2dpm)×ΩS2dpm+1ΩS2d+1, and one can easily check that this map
is an equivalence. This implies the desired ﬁber sequence (5 7).THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 75
whose Thom spectrum is T(n+k)/v[j,n+k). This is the desired relationship between
the various presentations of T(n+k)/v[j,n+k).
Remark 4.2.11. Observe that the preceding discussion implies, in particul ar, that
there is a map qk: ΩJpk−1(S2pn)→BGL1(y(n))such that the composite S2pn−1→
ΩJpk−1(S2pn)→BGL1(y(n))detectsvn∈π2pn−2y(n), and such that the Thom
spectrum of the map qkisy(n+k). Takingk→ ∞, this implies that there is a
mapq∞: Ω2S2pn+1→BGL1(y(n))whose Thom spectrum is y(∞) =Fp. The map
q∞is adjoint to the E1-mapΩ3S2pn+1
+→y(n)from [MRS01 , Section 4.1] which
detectsvnon the bottom cell of the source.76 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Appendix A. Analogues for koandtmf
Many of the results from the body of this article extend to the case ofkoand
tmf. In this section, we will state these results; since the proo fs are essentially
the same, we will not give arguments unless the situation is s ubstantially diﬀerent.
We will specialize to the case p= 2for simplicity. One of the main observations
in Theorem 2.2.4 is that the structure of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htas anE1-algebra over X(pn)(or
rather,T(n)) mirrors the structure of Zpas anE1-algebra over S0. Forkoand
tmf, there are analogues of X(pn), which we studied in [ Dev23a ].
Recollection A.1. LetAdenote the free E1-algebraS/ /νwith a nullhomotopy of ν,
i.e., the Thom spectrum of the E1-mapΩS5→BGL1(S)which detects ν∈π3(S)on
the bottom cell21. This spectrum has the property that H∗(A;F2)∼=F2[ζ4

to the inclusion of F2[ζ4
1]. In particular, the map A→kois an equivalence in
dimensions ≤4. There is in fact an E1-mapA→MSpin , induced from an E1-
mapΩS5→BSpin . There is also an E1-mapA→X(2) =T(1), such that
T(1)≃A⊗Cη. We note that the “ Q0-Margolis homology” of H∗(ko;F2)(i.e., the
homology of Sq1viewed as a diﬀerential acting on H∗(ko;F2)) is precisely H∗(A;F2).
Similarly, let Bdenote the E1-algebra of [ Dev23a , Deﬁnition 3.2.17]22, so
that there is an E1-spaceNsuch thatBis the Thom spectrum of an E1-map

is obtained from the E1-quotientS/ /σby further taking an “ E1-quotient” by the
class inπ11(S/ /σ)constructed from a nullhomotopy of νσ∈π10(S). This spectrum
has the property that H∗(B;F2)∼=F2[ζ8

an equivalence in dimensions ≤12. There is in fact an E1-mapB→MString .
There is also an E1-mapB→T(2)such thatT(2)≃B⊗DA1, whereDA1is
an8-cell complex whose mod 2cohomology is isomorphic to the subalgebra of
the Steenrod algebra generated by Sq2andSq4. We note that the “ Q0-Margolis
homology” of H∗(tmf;F2)(i.e., the homology of Sq1viewed as a diﬀerential acting
onH∗(tmf;F2)) is precisely H∗(B;F2).
The following was implicitly stated in [ Dev23a ], but we make it explicit here:
21The spectrum Ahas been studied before by Mahowald and his coauthors in [ Mah79,
DM81, Mah81b, Mah81a, Mah82, MU77 ], where it is often denoted X5.

A calculation paralleling Proposition 2.2.14 shows:
Proposition A.3. Assume Conjecture A.2. There are isomorphisms
H∗(THH(ko/A);F2)∼=H∗(ko;F2)[σ(ζ3)]⊗F2ΛF2(σ(ζ2

H∗(THH(tmf/B);F2)∼=H∗(tmf;F2)[σ(ζ4)]⊗F2ΛF2(σ(ζ2
3)).
Here,|σ(ζ3)|= 8,|σ(ζ2
2)|= 7,|σ(ζ4)|= 16, and|σ(ζ2
3)|= 15.
Using the Adams spectral sequence for π∗THH(ko/A)andπ∗THH(tmf/B)as
in Theorem 2.2.4(b) (and using ko- andtmf-linearity), one ﬁnds:
Theorem A.4. Assume Conjecture A.2. Upon 2-completion, there are equivalences
THH(ko/A)≃ko⊕/circleplusdisplay
j≥1Σ8j−1ko/2j,
THH(tmf/B)≃tmf⊕/circleplusdisplay
j≥1Σ16j−1tmf/2j.
Remark A.5. Sinceko⊗Cη≃ku, Theorem A.4 implies that THH(ko/A)⊗Cη≃
THH(ku/T(1)). Relatedly, there is an equivalence ko⊗T(1)≃ku[ΩS5]ofE1-T(1)-
algebras, which implies that
THH(ko) ⊗T(1)≃THH(ko ⊗T(1)/T(1))≃ku[S5]⊕/circleplusdisplay
j≥1Σ8j−1ku[S5]/2j.
Along similar lines, Theorem A.4 implies that THH(tmf/B)⊗DA1≃THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{t2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/T(2)).
There is also a 2-local equivalence tmf⊗T(2)≃BP/an}b∇acketle{t2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[N]ofE1-T(2)-algebras, so
that
THH(tmf) ⊗T(2)≃BP/an}b∇acketle{t2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[BN]⊕/circleplusdisplay
j≥1Σ16j−1BP/an}b∇acketle{t2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[BN]/2j.
Note that BP/an}b∇acketle{t2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[N]≃BP/an}b∇acketle{t2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht[ΩS9×ΩS13], so thatπ∗(tmf⊗T(2))∼=Z(2)[v1,v2,x8,y12],
where|v1|= 2,|v2|= 6,|x8|= 8, and|y12|= 12. This gives a potential ap-
proach to calculating THH(ko) (resp.THH(tmf) ) via theT(1)-based (resp. T(2)-
based) Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. Describing this s pectral sequence is es-
sentially equivalent to calculating the analogue of the top ological Sen operator for
THH(ko/A), whose construction is described below in Construction A.9 .
Remark A.6. Recall from Figure 1 that the structure of kooverAmirrors the
structure of tmfoverB, which in turn mirrors the structure of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn/an}b∇acket∇i}htoverT(n);
in other words, the calculation of Theorem A.4 is along the di agonal line (n,n)in
Figure 1. It is natural to wonder whether there is an E1-ring/tildewideAequipped with an
E1-mapA→/tildewideAand anE1-map/tildewideA→kosuch that the structure of koover/tildewideAmirrors
the structure of BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htoverT(n). (This is the “oﬀ-diagonal line” (n,n−1)in
Figure 1.) This question is only interesting when p= 2, sinceko(p)splits as a direct
sum of even shifts of BP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}htifp>2. Let us localize at 2for the remainder of this
discussion. Examining the argument establishing Theorem A .4 whenp= 2, one
ﬁnds that the mod 2homology of/tildewideAmust be H∗(/tildewideA;F2)∼=F2[ζ4
1,ζ2
2].
IfAadmits the structure of an Efr
2-ring, then/tildewideAcan be constructed as follows.
The classσ1∈π5(A)determined by a nullhomotopy of ην(see [Dev23a , Remark78 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
3.2.17]) deﬁnes a map S6→BGL1(A), which, thanks to our assumption on A,
extends to an E1-mapΩS7→BGL1(A). The desired E1-A-algebra/tildewideAcan be
deﬁned as Thom spectrum of this map. (According to [ Dev23a , Remark 5.1.5],
one should not expect /tildewideAto admit a natural construction as a Thom spectrum over
the sphere.) Note that /tildewideA⊗Cη≃T(2).
The same argument as Theorem 2.2.4(a) shows:
Proposition A.7. If bothAand/tildewideAadmit the structure of Efr
2-rings and koadmits
the structure of an E1-/tildewideA-algebra, then there is a 2-complete equivalence
THH(ko//tildewideA)≃ko[ΩS9],
where the generator in π8THH(ko//tildewideA)isσ2(v2). Moreover,
(58) Hc
∗(TP(ko//tildewideA);F2)∼=F2[ζ4
1,ζ2
2,ζ2
3,ζ4,···]((/planck⋊ver2pi1)).
Remark A.8. Similarly, if Badmits the structure of an Efr
2-ring, the class σ2∈
π13(B)from [Dev23a , Remark 3.2.24] deﬁnes a map S14→BGL1(B). Thanks
to our assumption on B, this extends to an E1-mapΩS15→BGL1(B). Deﬁne/tildewideB
to be Thom spectrum of this map, so that H∗(/tildewideB;F2)∼=F2[ζ8
1,ζ4
2,ζ2
3]. Note that
/tildewideB⊗DA1≃T(3).
If/tildewideBadmits the structure of an Efr
2-ring and tmfadmits the structure of an
E1-/tildewideB-algebra, then the same argument as in Theorem 2.2.4(a) show s that there is
a2-complete equivalence
THH(tmf//tildewideB)≃tmf[ΩS17],
where the generator in π16THH(tmf//tildewideB)isσ2(v3). Moreover,

Construction A.9 (Topological Sen operator for THHrelative toA).By [BCS10 ,
Theorem 1], THH(A)is equivalent to the Thom spectrum of the composite
LS5Lν− − →LB2GL1(S)≃B2GL1(S)×BGL1(S)id×η− −− →BGL1(S).
There is a nonsplit ﬁber sequence
(60) ΩS5→LS5→S5,
and the restriction of the above composite along the map ΩS5→LS5is the
mapΩS5→BGL1(S)which deﬁnes A. It follows from the ﬁber sequence (60)
thatTHH(A)is the Thom spectrum of a map S5→BGL1(A)which detects
a classx∈π4(A)∼=π4(ko). In particular, THH(A)is anA-module with two
cells. Now assume Conjecture A.2; then [ DHL+23, Corollary 2.8] gives a splitting
THH(A)→A, which implies that the class x∈π4(A)must be trivial. In other
words,THH(A)≃A[S5]. IfCis anA-linear∞-category, this implies the existence
of a coﬁber sequence
(61) THH( C)→THH( C/A)Θ′
−→Σ6THH( C/A).
One should be able to recover the calculation of THH(ko) from [AHL10 ] using
(61) in the case C= Mod koand the calculation of Theorem A.4. Similarly toTHH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 79
Remark 2.2.5, Theorem A.4 and (61) imply that
THH(ko/A)/2≃ko[S7×ΩS9]/2,
THH(ko) ⊗koF2≃F2[S5×S7×ΩS9].
The latter of these has been proven by Angeltveit-Rognes in [ AR05 , Theorem 6.2].
Remark A.10. Recall from [ MR99 , Corollary 9.3] that Mahowald-Rezk duality
gives an equivalence Wko≃Σ6ko(resp.WBP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht ≃Σ2pBP/an}b∇acketle{t1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht); the shift of 6(resp.
2p) in this equivalence arises for the same reason as in (61) (re sp. (16) with n= 1):
both correspond to the class σ2(t2
1)(resp.σ2(t1)). We hope to explore this further
in future work.
Remark A.11. There is also an analogue of the topological Sen operator for B.
To describe it, one observes using an argument similar to Con struction A.9 that
THH(B/S/ /σ)≃B[S13]and that THH(S/ /σ)≃(S/ /σ)[S9]. This implies that if C
is aB-linear∞-category, there are coﬁber sequences
THH( C/S/ /σ)→THH( C/B)ΘB− − →Σ14THH( C/B),
THH( C)→THH( C/S/ /σ)Θ′
B− − →Σ10THH( C/S/ /σ).
However, it is signiﬁcantly more complicated to describe th ese coﬁber sequences in
almost any nontrivial example, so we omit further discussio n. Nevertheless, one can
use Theorem A.4 to show the following equivalences analogou s to Remark 2.2.5:
THH(tmf/B)/2≃tmf[S15×ΩS17]/2,
THH(tmf) ⊗tmfF2≃F2[S9×S13×S15×ΩS17];
note that F2[S9×S13]≃F2[BN]. The latter of these has been proven by Angeltveit-
Rognes in [ AR05 , Theorem 6.2].
Assume Conjecture A.2, and let p= 2. Then there is a map MT(1)→MAof
stacks over MFG, which exhibits MT(1)as a2-fold fppf cover of MA. Recall that
MT(1)is isomorphic to the moduli stack of graded formal groups equ ipped with a
coordinate up to order ≤2(equivalently, order ≤3for2-typical formal groups).
Similarly, we have:
Proposition A.12. The stack MAis isomorphic to the moduli stack of graded
formal groups equipped with an even coordinate up to order ≤5.
Proof. Recall that there is a ﬁber sequence
SU(2)/U(1)∼=S2→BU(1)≃CP∞→BSU(2)≃HP∞.
Letn≥1. There is a homotopy equivalence HPn×HP∞CP∞≃CP2n+1(since
S4n+3/SU(2) = HPnandS4n+3/U(1) =CP2n+1), which produces the “twistor
ﬁbration”, i.e., the ﬁber sequence
(62) S2→CP2n+1→HPn.
The map CP2n+1→HPnis given in coordinates by the map [z1:···:z2n+2]/mapsto→
[z1+z2j:···:z2n+1+z2n+2j]. Note that SU(2)/U(1) =CP1is the unit sphere
S(su(2))in the adjoint representation of SU(2) , so (62) equivalently says that
CP2n+1is the sphere bundle of the adjoint bundle of rank 3overHPn.
LetRbe a complex-oriented homotopy commutative ring with assoc iated for-
mal group Goverπ∗(R); we will assume for simplicity that 2is not a zero-divisor80 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
inπ∗R. ThenR∗(CP5)is isomorphic to the ring of functions on Gwhich vanish
to order ≥6. The Serre spectral sequence associated to the ﬁber sequenc e (62)
implies that R∗(HP2)is isomorphic to R∗(CP5)Z/2, whereZ/2acts by inversion
on the formal group. This implies the desired claim, since th ere is an equivalence
HP2≃Σ4Cνof spectra, and Ais the free E1-ring whose unit factors through the
inclusionS0→Cν. /square
Remark A.13. The description of MAin Proposition A.12 has concrete applica-
tions; for instance, in [ Dev22 ], we show that Mtmf⊗A=MA×MFGMellcan be
identiﬁed with the moduli stack of elliptic curves Eequipped with a splitting of the
Hodge ﬁltration on H1
dR(E), and use this to describe an topological analogue of the
integral ring of quasimodular forms.
Remark A.14. As explained in [ Dev23a , Remark 7.1.7], there is a Z/2-equivariant
E1-algebraAZ/2whose underlying E1-algebra is A, and such that ΦZ/2AZ/2=
X(2)(2)asE1-algebras. This is a topological interpretation of the foll owing ob-
servation suggested by Proposition A.12: MAis “half” of MX(2); more precisely,
there is a two-fold fppf cover MX(2)→MA. This is an algebraic analogue of the
equivalence A⊗Cη≃X(2).
We also note that there is a Z/2-equivariant analogue of the ﬁber sequence
(62): namely, there is a Z/2-equivariant twistor ﬁbration

whereZ/2acts onHPnvia the action of Z/2⊆S1⊆SO(3) onH. The underlying
ﬁbration is (62), while the Z/2-ﬁxed points gives the ﬁbration
S1→RP2n−1→CPn−1
which exhibits RP2n−1as the sphere bundle of the complex line bundle O(2)on
CPn−1.
Construction A.15. One consequence of the identiﬁcation of MAin Proposi-
tion A.12 is that MA→MFGis an aﬃne bundle, so that the pullback of the
cotangent complex LMA/MFGtoSpec(BP ∗(A))/Gm∼=Spec(BP ∗[t2
1+v1t1])/Gm
can be identiﬁed with a free BP∗[t2
1+v1t1]-module of rank 1generated by the class
d(t2
1+v1t1)in weight 2. Using Recollection 4.1.9, we obtain the algebraic analogu e
of (61): ifXis a stack over MA, there is a coﬁber sequence
HH(X/MFG)→HH(X/MA)Θmot− −− →Σ6,3HH(X/MA).
The stack Mkocan be identiﬁed with the moduli stack of curves of the form y=
x2+bx+cwith change of coordinate x/mapsto→x+r, andHH(Mko/MFG)describes the
E1-page of the Adams-Novikov-Bökstedt spectral sequence cal culating THH(ko)
(see Remark 4.1.5). It would be interesting to explicitly de scribeHH(Mko/MFG);
note that
π∗HH(Mko/MA)∼=OMko/an}b∇acketle{tσ2vj|j≥2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht⊗OMkoΛOMko(dti|i≥2),
whereσ2(vj)lives in degree 2j+1and weight 2j, anddtilives in degree 2i+1−1and
weight2i. This can be proved exactly as in Example 4.1.8; weight consi derationsTHH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 81
presumably allow one to fully describe Θmot: HH(X/MA)→Σ6,3HH(X/MA), and
henceHH(Mko/MFG).
Remark A.16. Assume Conjecture A.2, and let p= 2. It is trickier to describe
the stack MBin a manner analogous to Proposition A.12. As a ﬁrst approxim ation,
if we assume that S/ /σadmits the structure of a homotopy commutative ring, one
can attempt to describe the moduli stack MS/ /σ. However, it is provably impossible
to construct a Hurewicz ﬁbration
S4→HP5→OP2
in the point-set category. This is a consequence of [ Sch81 , Theorem 5.1], which
states more generally that if F→E→Xis a Hurewicz ﬁbration where Eis
homotopy equivalent to HP2n+1andFandXare homotopy equivalent to ﬁnite
CW-complexes, then either ForXmust be contractible. Note that this result
implies that there cannot even be a Hurewicz ﬁbration
S4→HP3→S8.
Similarly, there cannot be Hurewicz ﬁbrations
CP3→CP7→S8,
CP3→CP11→OP2;
see [LV94 ] for the impossibility of the ﬁrst Hurewicz ﬁbration (which implies the
impossibility of the second Hurewicz ﬁbration). These no-g o results make it diﬃcult
to give a formal group-theoretic description of R∗(OP2)(and hence of MS/ /σ, since
OP2≃Σ8Cσ) whereRis a complex-oriented homotopy commutative ring.
The story for koadmits a slightly diﬀerent generalization to higher height s.
Example A.17. Observe that S5= SU(4)/Sp(2), and that the map ΩS5→BU
(whose Thom spectrum is A) can be viewed as the composite
Ω(SU(4)/Sp(2))→Ω(SU/Sp)≃BSp→BU.
The equivalence Ω(SU/Sp)≃BSpis given by Bott periodicity, and the map BSp→
BUtakes a symplectic bundle to its underlying unitary bundle.
Motivated by Example A.17, we are led to the following deﬁnit ion:
Deﬁnition A.18. Deﬁne an E1-algebraXH(n)via the Thom spectrum of the
composite
Ω(SU(2n)/Sp(n))→Ω(SU/Sp)≃BSp→BU.
There is a canonical E1-mapXH(n)→XH(∞) = MSp .
The spectrum XH(n)has been studied by Andy Baker.
Remark A.19. See [CM88 ] for a detailed study of the space Ω(SU(2n)/Sp(n)).
Let us note that if SU(2n)Hdenotes the Z/2-equivariant loop space with the Z/2-
action given by the symplectic involution
A/mapsto→JAJ−1, J=/parenleftbigg
0−1
1 0/parenrightbigg⊕n
,
thenΩ(SU(2n)/Sp(n))≃(ΩσSU(2n)H)Z/2. Indeed, the ﬁxed points of SU(2n)H
isSp(n)(by deﬁnition), so we can apply the ﬁrst sentence of Example 3 .3.20 to
conclude.82 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Remark A.20. As the notation indicates, XH(n)should be viewed as a quater-
nionic analogue of the X(n)spectra from [ Rav84 ]; see Table 2.

be interpreted as follows: H∗(ΦZ/2X(2n)R;F2)is a direct sum
of even shifts of F2[ζ1,···,ζn]; similarly for H∗(X(2n);F2)and
H∗(XH(2n);F2).
Note that there are isomorphisms of algebras
H∗(ΦZ/2X(n)R;F2)∼=H∗(Ω(SU(n)/SO(n));F2)∼=F2[x1,···,xn−1],
H∗(XH(n);Z)∼=H∗(Ω(SU(2n)/Sp(n));Z)∼=Z[y1,···,yn−1],
where|xj|=jand|yj|= 4j.
Example A.21. By construction, XH(2)≃A=S/ /ν.
Construction A.22. Suppose that XH(n)admits the structure of a homotopy
commutative ring. One can then also ask for an interpretatio n of the stack MXH(n)
analogous to Proposition A.12. It turns out that the diﬃcult ies of Remark A.16 are
no longer an issue for XH(n). Indeed, the analogue of the map S4→ΩS5(whose
Thomiﬁcation is the map Cν→Aused in the proof of Proposition A.12) is given
by a mapι:HPn−1→Ω(SU(2n)/Sp(n))which exhibits HPn−1as the generating
complex of Ω(SU(2n)/Sp(n)). (See, e.g., [ CM88 , Proposition 1.4].) Moreover, the
composite
HPn−1ι− →Ω(SU(2n)/Sp(n))→Ω(SU/Sp)≃BSp
factors as HPn−1֒→HP∞≃BSp(1)→BSp. Since the Thom spectrum of the
tautological quaternionic line bundle over HPn−1isΣ−4HPn, the mapιThomiﬁes
to a map Σ−4HPn→XH(n).
Using the twistor ﬁbration (62) and the map Σ−4HPn→XH(n)of Construc-
tion A.22, one can argue as in Proposition A.12 to show:
Proposition A.23. The stack MXH(n)is isomorphic to the moduli stack of graded
formal groups equipped with an even coordinate up to order ≤2n+1.
Remark A.24. Suppose that XH(n)admits the structure of an Efr
2-ring. There is
also a canonical map MXH(n−1)→MXH(n)which exhibits MXH(n)as the quotient
ofMXH(n−1)by the group scheme G(2n−2)
a/GmoverBGm, whereG(2n−2)
a denotes
the aﬃne line with Gm-action of weight 2n−2. This is the algebraic analogue of
the following:
Lemma A.25. The spectrum XH(n)is equivalent to the Thom spectrum of a map
ΩS4n−3→BGL1(XH(n−1)).THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 83
Proof. By [Dev23a , Proposition 2.1.6] (see also [ Bea17 ]), it suﬃces to es-
tablish that there is a ﬁber sequence of E1-spaces
Ω(SU(2n−2)/Sp(n−1))→Ω(SU(2n)/Sp(n))→ΩS4n−3.
To see this, observe that there is a diﬀeomorphism SU(2n)/Sp(n)∼=SU(2n−
1)/Sp(n−1), and hence a ﬁbration
SU(2n−2)/Sp(n−1) /d47/d47SU(2n−1)/Sp(n−1)
∼=
/d15/d15/d47/d47SU(2n−1)/SU(2n−2)
∼=
/d15/d15
SU(2n−2)/Sp(n−1) /d47/d47SU(2n)/Sp(n) /d47/d47S4n−3.
The desired ﬁber sequence is obtained by looping the bottom r ow. /square
Remark A.26. On the bottom cell of the source, the map ΩS4n−3→BGL1(XH(n−
1))deﬁnes a class χH
n∈π4n−5XH(n−1), andχH
2nis detected in the E2-page of the
Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for XH(2n−1)by[t2
n]. Moreover, if XH(n−1)
admits the structure of an Efr
2-ring andXH(n)admits the structure of an E1-
XH(n−1)-algebra, then THH(XH(n)/XH(n−1))≃XH(n)[ΩS4n−3].
We can then conclude (as in Theorem 3.1.4 and Example 4.1.11) that if Cis
anXH(n)-linear∞-category and Xis a stack over MXH(n), then there are coﬁber
sequences
THH( C/XH(n−1))→THH( C/XH(n))Θ′
−→Σ4n−2THH( C/XH(n)),
HH(X/MXH(n−1))→HH(X/MXH(n))Θmot− −− →Σ4n−2,2n−1HH(X/MXH(n)).
Only the ﬁrst coﬁber sequence requires that XH(n−1)andXH(n)admit the
structure of Efr
2-rings, and that XH(n)admits the structure of an E1-XH(n−1)-
algebra; the second coﬁber sequence only requires that XH(n)admit the structure
of a homotopy commutative ring.84 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
Appendix B. Alternative calculation of /hatwideΩ/D
Z/pn
In this brief section, we give an alternative algebraic argu ment for Corol-
lary 3.2.15 following [ BL22b , Example 5.15]. I am very grateful to Sasha Petrov
for an illuminating discussion about this entire appendix; see also [ Pet23 , Lemma
6.13].
Alternative proof of Corollary 3.2.15. LetRbe a (discrete) commu-
tativeZ/pn-algebra. Then [ BL22b , Construction 3.8] implies that
Spec(Z/pn)/D(R)≃MapCAlg(Z/pn,W(R)/V(1))
≃ {z∈W(R)|zV(1) =pn}={x∈W(R)|V(Fz) =pn}.
SinceVis injective, this is a torsor for W[F](R) =G♯
a(R). Moreover, this torsor
is trivializable, i.e., pnis in the image of VF. In fact, we claim that
(63) pn=V(pn−1) =VF(V(pn−2))∈W(Z/pn).
To see this, let us compute in ghost coordinates. Recall that ifw(x) = (w0(x),w1(x),···)
are the ghost coordinates of x∈W(R), thenwn+1(Vx) =pwn(x). Sincew(pn) =
(pn,pn,···)andw(V(pn−1)) = (0,pn,pn,···), we see that
w(pn−V(pn−1)) = (pn,0,0,···).
Since the map G♯
a∼=W[F]→Wsendsx∈G♯
ato the Witt vector whose ghost
coordinates are (x,0,0,···), the claim (63) follows from the observation that pn∈
W[F](Zp)is sent to zero in W[F](Z/pn). /square
Remark B.1. As pointed out by Sasha Petrov, the preceding calculation al so
determines the G♯
m-action on Spec(Z/pn)/Das follows. The above discussion says
that the isomorphism G♯
a∼− →Spec(Z/pn)/Dsendsx/mapsto→x+V(pn−2). Under this
isomorphism, the action of g∈G♯
monx+V(pn−2)∈Spec(Z/pn)/Dis given by
g(x+V(pn−2)) =gx+gV(pn−2) =gx+V(F(g)pn−2);
butF(g) = 1 sinceG♯
m=W×[F], so that this can be identiﬁed with gx+V(pn−2).
In other words, the isomorphism G♯
a∼− →Spec(Z/pn)/Dis equivariant for the scaling
action of G♯
monG♯
a.
One can get a formula which is more “accurate” than (63) via th e following (see
also [Ill22, Page 56], where part of this statement is attributed to Gabb er)24.
Lemma B.2. Letydenote the element of W(Zp)associated to the ghost coordinates
(1−pp−1,1−pp2−1,···). Then [p] +V(y) =p. Moreover, y=Fxfor some
x∈W(Zp)if and only if p>2; in this case, x∈W(Zp)×(and hence y∈W(Zp)×).
Ifp= 2, theny[2m]is in the image of Ffor anym≥2.
Remark B.3. Let us assume pis odd for simplicity. Then Lemma B.2 implies
thatp−[p]∈W(Zp)is a unit multiple of V(1), sincep−[p] =V(y) =xV(1)and
x∈W(Zp)×.25It follows from [ BL22b , Construction 3.8] that if X= Spf(R)is a
boundedp-adic formal scheme, then the diﬀracted Hodge complex X/Dis given on
p-nilpotent rings SbyX/D(S) =X(W(R)/(p−[p])).
24Our understanding is that this result is quite well-known; s ome form is heavily used in
[BMS18 ].
25Analogously, [2](2−[2]) = [2] V(y) =V(y[4])∈W(Zp)is divisible by V(1)forp= 2.THH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 85
Remark B.4. ApplyingFto the identity [p]+V(y) =p, we see that [p2] =p(1−y).
In particular, the element a∈W(Zp)of [Dri22 , Lemma 4.7.3] can be identiﬁed
with1−y.
Remark B.5. Using Lemma B.2, we can give an “alternative” formula for a pr eim-
age ofpnunderVF. Indeed, we have p= [p] +V(y)for somey∈W(Zp), so
thatpn= [pn] +/summationtextn−1

FV=p, we haveV(a)n=V(pn−1an)by an easy induction on n. Moreover,
[pi]V(a) =V(aF[pi]) =V([ppi]a). Since [pn] = 0∈W(Z/pn)(and hence in
W(R)), we have

Assumep>2, so that Lemma B.2 implies that y=Fxfor somex∈W(Zp). The

One can check that

It therefore suﬃces to show that the Witt vector a∈W(Zp)with coordinates
wj(a) =ppj+1n−1vanishes in W(Z/pn), which follows from a direct calculation.
Let us end with a proof of Lemma B.2; the explicit formulas bel ow are unnec-
essary for any conceptual development, but we included it si nce the computation
was rather fun.
Proof of Lemma B.2. First, it is easy to see that yis well-deﬁned. Let
us now check that p= [p] +V(y). Ifw(x) = (w0(x),w1(x),···)are the ghost
coordinates of x∈W(R), thenwn+1(Vx) =pwn(x). It follows that wn(Vy) =
p−ppn. Sincew([p]) = (p,pp,pp2,···), we have
w([p]+Vy) =w([p])+w(Vy) = (p,p,···) =w(p),
so thatp= [p]+V(y), as claimed.
To prove the claim about ybeing in the image of F, recall that if x∈W(R),
then the ghost coordinates of Fxare given by wn(Fx) =wn+1(x). In particular,
y=Fxfor somex∈W(Zp)if and only if we can solve
1−ppn−1=xpn
0+pxpn−1
1+···+pnxn86 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
for somex0,···,xn∈Zpand alln≥1. This is impossible for p= 2. Indeed, ﬁrst
note that we need x2
0+2x1= 1−pp−1=−1, so thatx2
0≡1 (mod 2) (and hence
x0≡1 (mod 2) ). Writex0= 1+2s, so thatx2
0+2x1= 1+4s(1+s)+2x1. In order
for this to equal 1−pp−1=−1, we need 4s(1+s)+2x1=−2, i.e.,x1≡1 (mod 2) .
This implies that x4
0≡1 (mod 8) andx2
1≡1 (mod 4) (so2x2
1≡2 (mod 8) ). Since
1−pp2−1=−7 =x4
0+2x2
1+4x2, we can reduce modulo 8to ﬁnd that 1≡1+2+4x2
(mod 8) . But then x2would solve 4x2≡ −2 (mod 8) , which is impossible.
Now assume p>2. Sincexp
0+px1= 1−pp−1, we havexp
0≡1 (modp); this
implies that xpn
0≡1 (modpn+1). Writingxpn
0= 1−pn+1snfor somesn∈Zp, we
havex1=ps1−pp−2. Sincep>2, we see that x1=p(s1−pp−3)∈pZp. We claim
thatxnexists and is an element of pZpforn≥1. We established the base case
n= 1above, so assume that x1,···,xn−1∈pZp, and letxi=pti. We then have
pnxn= 1−ppn−1−(xpn

so that

n−1.
This is clearly divisible by psincep >2(so thatpn−1−n≥1forn≥1).
Therefore,xnexists and lives in pZp, as desired. (Note that if p= 2andn= 1,
thenpn−1−n= 0, sox1/ne}ationslash∈2Z2.) If one prefers an explicit formula, the above

p; this implies that x∈W(Zp)is invertible, as claimed.
Let us now assume that p= 2, and show that y[2m]is in the image of Ffor
anym≥2. To see this, observe that the ghost components of y[2m]are given by
wn(y[2m]) =wn(y)wn([2m]) = 2m2n(1−22n+1−1).
We therefore need to solve
2m2n−1(1−22n−1) =x2n

thatx2

now claim that xnexists forn≥0and lives in 2Z2. We established the base case

Appendix C. Cartier duals of W[Fn]andW×[Fn]
This section was inspired by the results proved above, but it does not play an
essential role in the body of this article. Corollary C.12 be low can be viewed as an
algebraic way to bookkeep the structure possessed by the top ological Sen operators;
and, as we hope to show in future work, it sits as an intermedia ry between the
topological and algebraic Sen operators of Theorem 3.1.4 an d Example 4.1.11 (see
Remark C.19). We begin with the following (presumably well- known) result. I am
(again) grateful to Sasha Petrov for a relevant discussion o n it.
Proposition C.1. There is an isomorphism of group schemes over Z(p)between
W[Fn] := ker(Fn:W→W)and the Cartier dual of the completion of Wn=W/Vn
at the origin.
Proof. Let us model Wby thep-typical big Witt vectors. Given f(t)∈W, let
a0,a1,a2,···denote the ghost components of f, so thattdlog(f(t)) =/summationtext
m≥0amtpm.
Thenf(t)∈W[Fn]if and only if am= 0form≥n.
Let us ﬁrst prove the claim of the proposition when n= 1. Then,dlog(f(t))is
a constant, and f(0) = 1 ; we claim that this is equivalent to the condition that f
deﬁnes a homomorphism ˆGa→Gm, i.e., thatf(x+y) =f(x)f(y). To check this,
ﬁrst suppose that f(x+y) =f(x)f(y). Then∂xf(x+y) =f(y)f′(x), so that
∂xf(x+y)
f(x+y)=f′(x)
f(x)=dlog(f(x))
is independent of y. Takingx= 0, we see that dlog(f(x))is constant, as desired.
The reverse direction (that dlog(f(x))being constant and f(0) = 1 implies that
f(x+y) =f(x)f(y)) is similar.
In the general case, note that since the Frobenius on Wshifts the ghost com-
ponents by F: (a0,a1,a2,···)/mapsto→(a1,a2,a3,···), the Frobenius Fapplied to f
satisﬁes:
dlog(Fj(f)(t)) =n−j/summationdisplay
m=0am+jtpm,
so that there is an equality of power series
Fj(f)(t) = exp/parenleftBiggn−j/summationdisplay
m=0am+j
pmtpm/parenrightBigg
.
Note that this is a slight variant of the the Artin-Hasse expo nential. Deﬁne a map
g:ˆWn→Gmon Witt components (x0,···,xn−1)(not ghost components!) as
follows:
g(x0,···,xn−1) =n−1/productdisplay

The coeﬃcient ofam
pmis precisely the mth Witt polynomial, so that the function
gis indeed additive on ˆWn. Moreover, the assignment f/mapsto→gindeed gives anTHH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 89
isomorphism W[Fn]∼− →Hom(ˆWn,Gm), as one can check inductively using the
casen= 1and the fact that it induces an isomorphism over Q. /square
Remark C.2 (Integral case) .One does not need p-typicality for the above state-
ment to hold. Namely, if Wdenotes the big Witt ring scheme, it is a classical
fact that the Cartier dual of WoverZis canonically identiﬁed with ˆW. As in the
p-typical case above, the pairing W×ˆW→Gmsends
(a,b)/mapsto→exp
/summationdisplay
n≥1wn(a)wn(b)
n
.
One only needs to check that this expression is in fact deﬁned overZ. To see this,
ﬁrst observe that if the Witt components of bare(b1,b2,···), we have

giving the desired integral representation. In fact, the la st step can be generalized
via the following rephrasing of the Dwork lemma:
Lemma C.3. LetRbe a torsionfree ring equipped with ring maps φp:R→R
for each prime psuch thatφp(r)≡rp(modp)for allr∈R. Let(xn)n≥1be a

copy ofGahas coordinate Φi). There is a fully faithful functor QCoh(BW[Fn])֒→
QCoh(Wn)whose essential image consists of those p-completeM∈QCoh(Wn)such
thatΦiacts locally nilpotently on H∗(M/p)for each0≤i≤n−1. Furthermore, this
functor is symmetric monoidal for the convolution tensor pro duct onQCoh(Wn).90 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
IfF∈QCoh(BW[Fn])is sent toM∈QCoh(Wn)under this functor, one
obtains a cube26Φ•: 2[n−1]→ModZpwhose vertices are all Mand such that the
edge from the subset {i1,···,ij−1}to{i1,···,ij}is given by the operator Φj:M→
M. Then, the global sections Γ(BW[Fn];F)can be identiﬁed with the total ﬁber
of the cube Φ•.
Remark C.5. More generally, the argument of Proposition C.1 shows that t here
is an isomorphism of group schemes over Z(p)betweenWm[Fn] := ker(Fn:Wm→
Wm)and the Cartier dual of Wn[Fm]. One can give a simpler proof of this fact over
a perfect ﬁeld kof characteristic p>0using the theory of Dieudonné modules: the
Dieudonné module of Wm[Fn]overkisW(k)[F,V]/(Fn,Vm), while the Dieudonné
module ofWn[Fm]overkisW(k)[F,V]/(Fm,Vn).
The argument of Proposition C.1 also shows the following (wh ich is already
discussed in [ Dri21 , Appendix D]):
Proposition C.6 ([Dri21 , Appendix D]) .LetˆGλbe the degeneration of ˆGmto
ˆGagiven by SpfZ(p)[t,λ,1
1+tλ]∧
twith group law x+y+λxy. Then the Z(p)[λ]-linear
Cartier dual of ˆGλis isomorphic to the group scheme D(ˆGλ) = Spec Z(p)[λ,z,/producttextn−1

Proof. A homomorphism f:ˆGλ→Gm×A1
λis an element of Z(p)[t,λ,1
1+tλ]∧
t
such that
f(x+y+λxy) =f(x)f(y).
This condition implies that
(1+λy)f′(x+y+λxy) =f(y)f′(x),
so that dividing both sides by f(x+y+λxy), we have
(1+λy)·dlog(f)(x+y+λxy) =dlog(f)(x).
Takingx= 0, we see that dlog(f)(y)is a constant multiple of1
1+λy(where the
constant is given byf′(0)
f(0)), and hence
f(y) = (1+λy)z/λ=/summationdisplay

for some ﬁxed z. This gives the desired claim, similarly to Proposition C.1 . Note
thatf(y) = exp(zlogF(y)), wherelogFis the logarithm of the formal group law

Remark C.8. A similar argument shows that if Gdenotes the group scheme

thatz(zp−1−λp−1)acts locally nilpotently on H∗(M⊗Z/pNFp).
Recollection C.9. In [BL22a , Lemma 3.5.18], Bhatt and Lurie show that the
following is a Cartesian square of group schemes over Z/pk:
(64) G♯
mlog/d47/d47
/d15/d15G♯
a
x/mapsto→exp(px)
/d15/d15
Gmx/mapsto→xp/d47/d47G(1)
m.
We will generalize this below in Corollary C.10. In [ DM23 ], we prove another
generalization of this square, albeit in a diﬀerent directi on:G♯
ais replaced by the
Cartier dual of a formal group ˆG, andG♯
mis replaced by an appropriate ˆG-analogue
of the divided power completion.
Corollary C.10. Letk≥0. There is an isomorphism of group schemes over Z/pk
between the Cartier dual of W×[Fn] := ker(Fn:W×→W×)and the completion
ofWnat itsFp-rational points Wn(Fp)∼=Z/pn.
Proof. Following [ BL22a , Remark 3.5.17], it suﬃces to prove the following
analogue of [ BL22a , Lemma 3.5.18]: there is a Cartesian diagram of ﬂat group
schemes over Z/pkgiven by
(65) W×[Fn]log/d47/d47
/d15/d15W[Fn]
x/mapsto→exp(pnx)
/d15/d15
Gm
x/mapsto→xpn/d47/d47G(n)
m.
Here, the left vertical map W×[Fn]→Gmis the composite
W×[Fn]→W×→W×/V∼=Gm.
Indeed, taking the Cartier dual of (65) and using Propositio n C.1, we obtain a
pushout diagram of formal group schemes
pnZ /d47/d47
/d15/d15Z
/d15/d15
ˆWn/d47/d47D(W×[Fn]).
This implies that D(W×[Fn])is the completion of Wnat itsFp-rational points
Wn(Fp)∼=Z/pn, as desired.
The proof that the square (65) is Cartesian is in fact a conseq uence of [ BL22a ,
Lemma 3.5.18]. As in [ BL22a , Lemma 3.5.18], since all group schemes involved are92 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
ﬂat over Z/pk, it suﬃces to prove that the diagram is Cartesian after base- changing
toFp(i.e., assume that k= 1). We begin by noting that there is an isomorphism
V:W×∼− → {x∈W|x0= 0}ofp-adic formal schemes sending x/mapsto→Vx. This
gives an isomorphism W[Fn]×µpn∼=W×[Fn]of group schemes over Fp, sending
(x,a)/mapsto→[a]+Vx. It therefore suﬃces to show that the composite
W[Fn]x/mapsto→1+Vx− −−−−− →W×[Fn]log− − →W[Fn]
is an isomorphism. But there is a commutative diagram
W[Fn−1]x/mapsto→1+Vx/d47/d47
/d15/d15W×[Fn−1]log/d47/d47
/d15/d15W[Fn−1]

W[Fn]x/mapsto→1+Vx/d47/d47

G♯
ax/mapsto→1+Vx/d47/d47G♯

a,
where the columns exhibit the third term as the quotient of th e ﬁrst two. By
induction on n(with the base case being provided by [ BL22a , Lemma 3.5.18]), we
may conclude that the middle horizontal composite is an isom orphism. /square
Remark C.11. One could have alternatively/equivalently proved Corolla ry C.10
by observing that the square (65) for n−1maps to (65) for n; all components of
this map of squares are the canonical ones, except on the bott om-right Gm(where
it is given by the pth power map Gm→G(1)
m). Diagramatically:

Taking Cartier duals, we obtain a map of pushout squares:
(67)pnZ ˆWn
Z D (W×[Fn])
pn−1Z ˆWn−1
Z D (W×[Fn−1]).
Again, Corollary C.10 follows by induction on n, using [ BL22a , Lemma 3.5.18] for
the base case.
Corollary C.12. Write the underlying scheme of Wnas/producttextn−1
i=0Ga(where the ith
copy ofGahas coordinate Ψi). There is a fully faithful functor QCoh(BW×[Fn])֒→
QCoh(Wn)whose essential image consists of those p-completeM∈QCoh(Wn)such
thatΨp
i−Ψiacts locally nilpotently on H∗(M/p)for each 0≤i≤n−1. Further-
more, this functor is symmetric monoidal for the convolution tensor product on
QCoh(Wn).
IfF∈QCoh(BW×[Fn])is sent toM∈QCoh(Wn)under this functor, one
obtains a cube Ψ•: 2[n−1]→ModZpwhose vertices are all Mand such that the edge
from the subset {i1,···,ij−1}to{i1,···,ij}is given by the operator Ψj:M→M.
Then, the global sections Γ(BW×[Fn];F)can be identiﬁed with the total ﬁber of
the cube Ψ•.
Example C.13. IfF,G∈QCoh(BW×[F2])correspond to tuples (M,ΨM
0,ΨM
1)
and(M′,ΨM′
0,ΨM′
1), then the global sections Γ(BW×[F2];F)can be identiﬁed

and(M′,ΨM′

n−1), let us write Ψ := (Ψ 0,Ψ0,···). Letwj(Ψ) =/summationtextj

Proposition C.14. Deﬁne a homomorphism W×[Fn]→Gmvia the composite
W×[Fn]→W×→(W/V)×∼=Gm.
LetO{1}denote the line bundle over BW×[Fn]determined by the resulting map
BW×[Fn]→BGm. Under the functor of Corollary C.12, the total space of the
line bundle O{1}corresponds to the p-completion of Zp[x±1]with the action of Ψj
determined by the following requirement on Witt polynomials :
(69) w(Ψ) = (w0(Ψ),w1(Ψ),w2(Ψ),···) = (x∂x,x∂x,x∂x,···).
Proof. The mapBW×[Fn]→BGmdetermines the stack Gm/W×[Fn]over
BW×[Fn], so that the corresponding object in QCoh(Wn)under the functor of
Corollary C.12 has underlying module given by OGm=Z[x±1]. It is not too hard
to show from the deﬁnition of the map BW×[Fn]→BGmthat under the functor of
Corollary C.12, the line bundle O{1}overBW×[Fn]corresponds to the p-complete
moduleZp(with generator x) whereΨ0acts onxby1, andΨjacts onxby zero
forj≥1. The action of wj(Ψ)onO{m}=Zp·xmthen follows from (68). /square

Remark C.16. Using Corollary C.4, a similar calculation can be used to de-
scribe the Ga-bundleGa/W[Fn]overBW[Fn]; and, in particular, the ∞-category
QCoh((Ga/W[Fn])/Gm). Let us summarize this calculation as follows. Recall that
Ga/W[F]∼=Ga/G♯
ais isomorphic to GdR
a, so that if A1:=Zp{x,∂x}/([∂x,x] = 1)
is the Weyl algebra, then QCoh(Ga/W[F])≃LMod∂x-nilp
A1. Similarly, if we write
1
m!∂m
x=∂[m]
x(so that∂[m]
x(xk) =/parenleftbigk
m/parenrightbig
xk−m), deﬁne A[n]

A[n]
1=Zp/braceleftBig
x,∂x,···,∂[pn−1]

/([∂[pj]
x,x] =∂[pj−1]
x).
Note that∂[pj−1]
x is ap-adic unit multiple of/producttextj−1
k=0(∂[pk]
x)p−1. Then, the action of
W[Fn]onGaimplies that there is an equivalence
QCoh(Ga/W[Fn])≃LMod∂[pj]
x-nilp
A[n]
1;
this can be extended to an equivalence between QCoh((Ga/W[Fn])/Gm)and the
∞-category of graded A[n]
1-modules such that ∂[pj]
xacts nilpotently for 0≤j≤
n−1, wherex∈A[n]
1has weight 1and∂[pj]
x∈A[n]
1has weight −pj. Algebras of
divided power diﬀerential operators such as A[n]
1were initially studied by Berthelot
in [Ber96 ].
Warning C.17. Note that Ga/W[Fn]is not a ring stack. Indeed, the map
W[Fn]→Gais not a quasi-ideal: the W-module structure on W[Fn]does not
factor through W։W1=Ga(ifFn(x) = 0 , thenxV(y) =V(F(x)y)need
not vanish). However, it doesfactor through W։Wn(ifFn(x) = 0 , thenTHH,BP/angb∇acketleftn/angb∇acket∇ight, AND A TOPOLOGICAL SEN OPERATOR 95
xVn(y) =Vn(Fn(x)y) = 0 ); indeed,Wn/W[Fn]∼=W/pnadmits the structure
of a ring stack.
Remark C.18. The proof of Corollary C.10 showed that there is an isomorphi sm
W×[Fn]∼=W[Fn]×µpn
overFp. LetXbe a smooth p-adic formal scheme over Zp, and letX=X⊗ZpFp.
Suppose that the G♯
m-action on/hatwideΩ/D
X⊗ZpFp=FX,∗Ω•
X/Fpreﬁnes to a W×[Fn]-
action. (For instance, let (/hatwideΩ/D
X)0denote the weight 0piece of the Z/p-grading
on/hatwideΩ/D
Xinherited from the G♯
m-action. The datum of a reﬁnement to a W×[F2]-
action leads to an operator on (/hatwideΩ/D
X)0which acts on grpi
conj/hatwideΩ/D
Xby multiplication by
−i.) In this case, the Z/p-grading on FX,∗Ω•
X/Fpfrom [BL22a , Remark 4.7.20]
would reﬁne to a Z/pn-grading; this would imply a reﬁnement of the Deligne-Illus ie
theorem [ DI87], stating that τ≥−pn+1FX,∗Ω•
X/Fpwould be decomposable.
Remark C.19 (“Witty” interpretation of [ Dev23b ]).The work of [ Lee22 ] sug-
gests that the base-change along BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗→Fp(even along BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht∗→
Zp) of the stack constructed from the associated graded of the m otivic ﬁltration
[HRW22 ] onTHH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)tZ/p(resp.THH(BP /an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht)) is isomorphic to the
stack(Gm/W×[Fn])/Gm∼=BW×[Fn](resp.(Ga/W[Fn])/Gm∼=(F∗W/pFn−1)/Gm).
We are currently investigating this and its consequences wi th Jeremy Hahn and Ar-
pon Raksit. In particular, this suggests that if a Zp-scheme “lifts to BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht”,
theG♯
m-action on/hatwideΩ/D
Xreﬁnes to a W×[Fn]-action. From this perspective, the op-
eratorsΨjfrom above are closely related to the topological Sen operat orsΘjfrom
the body of this article: roughly, Θjcan be understood as wj−1(Ψ).
Given Remark C.18, one is therefore naturally led to the foll owing question: if
Xis a smooth and proper Fp-scheme which “lifts to BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht” anddim(X)<pn,
does the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence for Xdegenerate at the E1-page? This
question need not make sense, since BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htis generally not an E∞-ring [Law18,
Sen17 ]. However, since BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}htadmits the structure of an E3-ring, one can
nevertheless ask whether such a degeneration statement hol ds noncommutatively if
QCoh(X)admits a lift to a left BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-linear∞-category. This line of thinking
was motivation for the following result (see [ Dev23b ]): ifQCoh(X)lifts to a left
BP/an}b∇acketle{tn−1/an}b∇acket∇i}ht-linear∞-category, and dim(X)< pn, then the Tate spectral sequence
forHP(X/Fp)degenerates at the E2-page.96 S. K. DEVALAPURKAR
