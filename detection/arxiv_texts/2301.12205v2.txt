Abstract. We analyze a non-linear elliptic boundary value problem, th at
involves ( p,q) Laplace operator, for the existence of its positive soluti on in
an arbitrary smooth bounded domain. The non-linearity here is driven by
a continuous function in (0 ,∞) which is singular, monotonically increasing
and eventually positive. We prove the existence of a positiv e solution of this
problem using a ﬁxed point theorem due to Amann[3]. In additi on, for a
speciﬁc nonlinearity we derive that the obtained solution i s maximal in nature.
The main results obtained here are ﬁrst of its kind for a ( p,q) Laplace operator
in an arbitrary bounded domain.
1.Introduction
We consider the following boundary value problem
−∆pu−∆qu=λf(u)
uβin Ω
u>0 in Ω (Pλ)
u= 0 on∂Ω
where Ω is a bounded domain in RNwith a smooth boundary, 0 <β <1, 1<q<
p<∞andλ>0 is a parameter. The term ∆ su:=div(|∇u|s−2∇u). We make the
following assumptions on f:
(H1)f: [0,∞)→Ris a continuous monotonically increasing function with
f(0)<0 andf(t)
tβis monotonically increasing.
(H2)f(t)
tβ>0 for somet>0.
Note that here lim s→0+f(s)
sβ=−∞and such problems are called inﬁnite semiposi-
tone problems. Establishing the existence of a positive solution to su ch problems
are challenging due to the presence of the singular term which is nega tive. More-
over, due to the non-homogeneous nature of the associated ope rator, many of the
well known methods are not directly applicable.
The motivation to study the non-homogeneous operator ( p,q) Laplacian em-
anates from pure mathematical interest and also due to its applicat ions in sev-
eral branches of science. The operator ( p,q) Laplacian, a generalisation of the
p-Laplacian, is deﬁned as an approximation of the mean curvature op erator in
Minkowski space which arises in the study of Born-Infeld equation, see [8] and [38].
The structure ofthe energyfunctional associatedwith ( p,q) Laplaciandrivesits ap-
plication into diverse ﬁelds, for instance in the study of the geometr y of anisotropic
materials, modelling of elementary particles ([5], [15]), chemical react ion design

([34], [11]), elasticity theory ([43]), biophysics ([20]), plasma physics ( [42]) etc. are
a few to name. Though the non-homogeneity of the operator make s the mathemat-
ical treatments strenuous, it is well studied in literature, see [11], [3 5], [19], [36],[21],
[22] and the references therein.
In general, the problem
−∆pu−∆qu=h(u) in Ω
u>0 in Ω (1.1)
u= 0 on∂Ω
is called semipositone problem if his a monotonically increasing sign-changing con-
tinuous function such that h(0)∈(−∞,0).Ifh(0) =−∞,we call this an inﬁnite
semipositone problem. Semipositone problems exhibit certain interes ting phenom-
ena which are not expected for positone problems (i.e. when h(0)>0). For exam-
ple, non-negative solutions for semipositone problems can have inte rior zeros (see
[9]) due to which proving the existence of positive solutions to semipos itone prob-
lems are comparatively harder. However topological tools such as d egree theory,
ﬁxed point methods, bifurcation theory etc. are mainly found reliab le in obtaining
the positive solution to semipositone problems (see [12], [26], [30] and [1 7]). But all
these methods depend strongly on the qualitative properties of th e solutions, such
as regularity, asymptotic behavior, a priori estimates, stability et c. Due to the non-
homogeneity of the operator, such results were not available for t he (p,q) Laplace
operator until recently. In [23], Giacomoni et.al. proved C1,αboundary regularity
for the solutions of singular elliptic problems involving ( p,q) Laplacian and in [39]
authors proved an asymptotic behavior of solutions for such prob lems. In light of
these latest developments, we address the question of the existe nce of a positive
solution to an inﬁnite semipositone problem using sub-super solution a pproach.
In the recent years, semipositone problems for non-homogeneou s operators are
gaining considerable attention. Das et al. in [14] proved the existenc e of a positive
solution for such a problem in an arbitrary domain when the reaction t erm is non-
singular. In[40], authorsstudy aninﬁnite semipositoneproblemfor( p,q) Laplacian
in an interval using a ﬁxed point theorem. Hai and co-authors in [29] have recently
studiedasimilarequationin aballbyassumingtheradialnatureofthe solutionand
convertingit to anODE.Theyhaveusedthe representationformu laforthe solution
to obtain the required estimates and prove the existence of a posit ive solution. The
approach discussed there cannot be extended to an arbitrary bo unded open set as
the method entirely depends on the symmetry of the domain. Never theless, Hai et
al., in a series of papers [1], [25], [26], [27] and [28], has considered similar p roblems
forp-Laplace operator in arbitrary bounded open sets in RN. Interested readers
may also refer to [2], [4],[13], [24], and [31] for semilinear or quasilinear ellip tic
problems with indeﬁnite sign non-linearity in bounded domains. The nov elty of
our paper lies in the fact that the results we obtain are ﬁrst of its kin d for a (p,q)
Laplace operator in an arbitrary domain with a singular non-linearity.
In Section 2, we focus on a general theory regarding the existenc e of positive
minimalandmaximalsolutionsandinSection3and4, wediscussspeciﬁc examples.
Theorem 1.1. Supposefsatisﬁes (H1) and (H2). Also assume that there exists
an ordered pair [ψ,φ]of sub- and supersolutions for (Pλ)such thatψ,φ∈C1
0(Ω),
there exists a positive constant c0satisfyingc0d(x)≤ψ(x)≤φ(x)and/ba∇dblψ/ba∇dbl∞>β0,INFINITE SEMIPOSITONE PROBLEM FOR P-Q LAPLACIAN 3
whereβ0= inf{t>0 :f(t)
tβ>0}. Then the problem (Pλ)admits a maximal and a
minimal solution within the ordered interval [ψ,φ].
The above theorem is rather a straight forward extension of resu lts in [16] to
the (p,q) Laplace operator, thanks to the global regularity result proved in [23].
Rather the nontrivial step is to prove the existence of sub-super solutions which
satisﬁes the assumptions mentioned in the above theorem. Non-line arity combined
with the non-homogeneity of the operator makes this task harder . In this context
we wish to emphasize that the results we prove here are not yet kno wn even for the
p-Laplacian operator.
In the next theorem under two more hypotheses on the non-linear functionf
we prove the existence of an ordered pair of sub-supersolutions b ounded below by
c0d(x).We assume that
(H3) There exist constants σ∈(0,β+1) andA >0 such that f(s)≥Asσfor
s>>1.
(H4) There exist γ >0 andB >0 such that β≤γ <β+1 andf(s)≤Bsγfor
s≥0.
The condition (H4) implies lim s→∞f(s)
sβ+1= 0.
Theorem 1.2. Suppose that fsatisﬁes hypothesis (H1)-(H4) and 2<q<p< ∞.
Then forλ>>1, there exists a positive solution for the problem (Pλ).
Motivated by the constructions given in [16] and [14], Theorem 1.2 is proved in
Section 3 by the sub-supersolutionapproach. The additional hypo thesisq>2helps
us to circumvent the non-homogeneity of the operator in a clever m anner. Ifp=q,
this restriction of q>2 is not necessary as the operator is no more inhomogeneous.
In section 4 we prove that ( Pλ) admits a maximal solution for a speciﬁc non-
linear function f. The existence of a global minimal or maximal solutions is the
foremost step in the bifurcation analysis of a semilinear elliptic problem , see [17]
where a similar problem is studied in case of Laplacian. In [17], author ha s shown
the existence of continuum of a branch of positive solutions emanat ing from inﬁnity
and a multiplicity result under a speciﬁc hypothesis. This phenomenon of multiple
positive solutions for non-linearities with indeﬁnite sign is diﬃcult to obt ain and
is understood completely only in the case of Laplacian in dimension one [ 18] and
for the strictly semipositone problems in higher dimension[10]. We believ e that
Theorem 1.3 along with the understanding of the weighted eigenvalue problem for
a p-Laplacian can throw some light into the multiplicity results for the a ssociated
quasilinear semipositone problem.
Our second main result in this paper is proved in Theorem 1.3, Section 4 . Before
stating the theorem we shall recall the function space where we se ek a positive
solution and its properties as given in [3]. Let P={u∈C1
0(Ω) :u≥0 in Ω}
denote the positive cone in C1
0(Ω).Then the interior of Pdenoted by P◦consists
of set of all {u∈C1
0(Ω) :∂u
∂ν<0}whereνdenotes the outward normal vector on
∂Ω.We shall prove that ( Pλ) admits a maximal positive solution in P◦.
Theorem 1.3. Letβ∈(0,1),2<q<p< ∞,σ∈(0,q−1)andf(s) = (sσ+β−1).
Then the problem (Pλ)admits maximal solution uλ∈ P◦for largeλ. Also,(Pλ)
does not admit any positive solution when λis small.
Towards the end of this article, we make an attempt to understand the exact be-
havior of the solution of a ”sublinear” elliptic problem given in (4.1). The estimate4 R. DHANYA, R. HARISH, SARBANI PRAMANIK
weobtain in Theorem4.4isofindependent interestand the result weo btain maybe
applicable to several other non-linear elliptic problems involving ( p,q) Laplacian.
Results we obtain is restricted to the case 2 <q<p< ∞.
2.Preliminaries on General Theory

Notations:
(1) Byd(x) we denote the distance of ∂Ω from the point x, i.e,
d(x) =inf{/ba∇dblx−y/ba∇dbl:y∈∂Ω}
(2) We write Ω ǫfor the set {x∈Ω :d(x)<ǫ}.
Lemma 2.2. Givenh∈C(Ω)such that |h(x)| ≤C
d(x)β,there exists a unique
w∈W1,p
0(Ω)solving
−∆pw−∆qw=hinΩ
w= 0on∂Ω (2.1)
in the weak sense.
Proof.We will prove the existence of the solution by the direct minimization te ch-
nique. The energy functional E:W1,p

w∈W1,p
0(Ω) and by weak comparison principle this minimizer wis the unique
weak solution of the required problem. /square
Lemma 2.3. Lethandwbe as in Lemma 2.2 and β∈(0,1).Then there exist
constantsα∈(0,1)andM >0, depending only on C,βandΩsuch thatw∈
C1,α(Ω)and/ba∇dblw/ba∇dblC1,α(Ω)<M.
Proof.Letube the solution of
−∆u=hin Ω
u= 0 on∂Ω (2.3)
and by lemma 3.1 from [27], there exist constants α∈(0,1) such that u∈C1,α(Ω).
Also, let ˜wbe the solution of
−∆p˜w−∆q˜w=|h|in Ω
˜w= 0 on∂ΩINFINITE SEMIPOSITONE PROBLEM FOR P-Q LAPLACIAN 5
Then, by weak comparison principle and proposition 2.7 from [23], ther e exists a
constantC1such thatw≤˜w≤C1d(x) in Ω. Again
−∆p(−w)−∆q(−w) =−h≤ |h|=−∆p˜w−∆q˜win Ω
and−w= ˜w= 0 on∂Ω.By a similar reasoning −w≤˜w≤C1d(x) in Ω and
therefore, we have,
(2.4) |w| ≤C1d(x) in Ω
Then from (2.1) and (2.3), we have,
(2.5) div/parenleftbig
|∇w|p−2∇w+|∇w|q−2∇w−∇u/parenrightbig
= 0 in Ω
andw= 0on ∂Ω.Now we conclude the proof by applying Lieberman’s boundary
regularity result given in Theorem 1.7 of [32]. /square
In this section, from now on, we assume that ( Pλ) admits a positive subsolution
ψ∈C1
0(Ω).Also we assume that ψ(x)≥c0d(x) for some positive constant c0and
/ba∇dblψ/ba∇dbl∞>β0whereβ0is given in Theorem 1.1. We deﬁne the set
A={u∈C1
0(Ω) :u(x)≥ψ(x)}
Fix aλ >0 and letu∈ Aand letg(u) :=λf(u)
uβ. Then|g(u)| ≤c1
d(x)βfor some
c1>0. Letwbe the unique weak solution of −∆pw−∆qw=g(u) in Ω,w= 0
on∂Ω which is now guaranteed to exist by Lemma 2.2. Since g is monotonically
increasing and u≥ψ, we have
−∆pw−∆qw=g(u)≥g(ψ)≥ −∆pψ−∆qψin Ω andw=ψ= 0 on∂Ω
Now by weak comparison principle, we have w≥ψ. Also, by Lemma 2.3, w∈
C1,α(Ω), form some α∈(0,1). Hence, we deﬁne the map Tgas given below.
Deﬁnition 2.4. We deﬁne the map Tg:A → AasTg(u) =wiﬀwis the weak
solution of
−∆pw−∆qw=g(u) in Ω
w= 0 on∂Ω (2.6)
Clearly,Tgis a well-deﬁned map from Ato itself. Next, we show that the map
Tg:A →C1
0(Ω) is completely continuous.
Lemma 2.5. Tg:A →C1
0(Ω)is completely continuous.
Proof.Fixu∈ A,thenu(x)≥c0d(x) and/ba∇dblu/ba∇dbl∞> β0.Leth∈C1
0(Ω) such
that/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblC1
0(¯Ω)< δ.Chooseδsmall enough so that u(x) +h(x)≥c0

/ba∇dblu+h/ba∇dbl∞>β0. Letwhbe the unique solution of
−∆pwh−∆qwh=g(h+u) in Ω
wh= 0 on∂Ω (2.7)
andwbe the unique solution of
−∆pw−∆qw=g(u) in Ω
w= 0 on∂Ω (2.8)
Note thatg(u+h)→g(u) pointwise as /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblC1
0(¯Ω)→0. As|g(u+h)| ≤C1d(x)−β,
by Lemma 2.3 there exists an α∈(0,1) such that /ba∇dblwh/ba∇dblC1,α(¯Ω)< M. Now by6 R. DHANYA, R. HARISH, SARBANI PRAMANIK

3.Sub-Super solution construction
In this section, we consider 2 <q<p< ∞and focus on constructing an ordered
pair sub and supersolutions for the problem ( Pλ) belonging to the set A.Here we
assumefsatisﬁes all the hypotheses ( H1)−(H4) mentioned in the introduction.
Lemma 3.1. Assumefsatisﬁes (H1)-(H3). Let φ1be the ﬁrst eigen function of
−∆with zero Dirichlet boundary condition. Deﬁne
ψ:=λr(φ1+φ2

where1
p−1+β< r <1
p−1+β−σ. Then, for large λ,ψ∈C1
0(Ω)is a subsolution for
the problem (Pλ)satisfyingψ(x)≥cλd(x).
Proof.From the deﬁnition, since β <1 it is clear that ψ∈C1
0(Ω) andψ(x)≥
cλd(x). We only need to show that ψis a subsolution for ( Pλ) whenλis large. We

Now ass >2,we have ∆ sφ1∈L∞(Ω) and by Vasquez ([41]), |∇φ1|>0 on∂Ω.
Thus there exists δ>0 andm>0 such that for in x∈Ωδ,
(3.2) Lp(φ1)<−mandLq(φ1)<0
Using (3.1) and (3 .2) we have
(3.3) −∆pψ−∆qψ≤ −mλr(p−1)

The last inequality is obtained directly from the deﬁnition of ψ.Now thatf(0) is

p−1+βandλ>>1,we have, in
Ωδ,
−mλr(p−1+β)
ψβ≤λf(0)
ψβ≤λf(ψ)
ψβ
Hence,
(3.4) −∆pψ−∆qψ≤λf(ψ)

In Ω\Ωδ, there exists a positive constant µsuch thatφ1> µand thusψ > λrµ.
Alsousingthemonotonicityof fandtheassumption(H3)on f, wehavefor λ>>1,
f(ψ)> f(λrµ)≥Aλrσµσ
Further, without loss of generality, we assume /ba∇dblφ1/ba∇dbl∞= 1. Therefore, in Ω \Ωδ, we
have, fors=p,q,

Now from (3.4) and (3.6) we have the required result.

Lemma 3.2. Assumefsatisﬁes (H1), (H2) and (H4).Then the problem (Pλ)
admits a super-solution for all λ>0.

Using the hypothesis ( H4) we can choose a constant m(λ)>>1 such that

−∆pφ−∆qφ≥ −∆pφ≥λf(φ)
φβin Ωφ≥0 on∂Ω.
Hence,φis a super-solution for ( Pλ). /square
Proof of Theorem 1.2: We note that under the hypotheses ( H1)−(H4) using
Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.2, the problem ( Pλ) admits a pair of sub-supersolutions
for allλ≥λ0.Alsoφ>0 inΩ and hence m(λ) can be chosen large enough so that
φ≥ψinΩ. Thus the ordered pair [ ψ,φ] satisﬁes all the conditions of Theorem 1.1
so that (Pλ) admits a minimal and maximal solution within the ordered interval
[ψ,φ]. /square.
4.Existence of Maximal Solution
In this section, we are interested in the following boundary value pro blem:
−∆pu−∆qu=λ(uσ−1
uβ) in Ω
u>0 in Ω (˜Pλ)
u= 0 on∂Ω
where 0< β <1,0< σ < q −1 and 2< q < p < ∞.It is evident that f(s) =
sσ+β−1 satisﬁes the hypotheses ( H1)−(H2). We deﬁne the solution set Sto be
S={u∈C1
0(Ω) :u(x)≥kd(x) for somek>0}.
Our aim in this section is to prove the existence of a positive maximal (g lobal
maximal) solution for the Dirichlet problem ( ˜Pλ) belonging to the set S.We can
verify that Ψ λ=λr(φ1+φ2
1+β
1) deﬁned in Lemma 3.1 is a positive subsolution of
(˜Pλ). If there exists a supersolution Φ λsuch that Ψ λ≤Φλ,then Theorem 1.2 can
be applied and it guarantees a maximal solution in the ordered interva l [Ψλ,Φλ].
Our aim in this section is to redeﬁne our supersolution appropriately s o that the
resulting solution obtained by Theorem 1.2 is in fact a maximal (global) s olution.
We make the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.1. We say that Φ λis a global supersolution to ( ˜Pλ) ifINFINITE SEMIPOSITONE PROBLEM FOR P-Q LAPLACIAN 9
(i) Φλis a supersolution of ( ˜Pλ) and
(ii) ifuis any solution of ( ˜Pλ), thenu≤Φλ.
We make the following observation which follows from Amman’s ﬁxed poin t
theorem.
Remark 4.2.Suppose there exists a global supersolution to ( ˜Pλ) which we call as
Φλ.Also assume that Ψ λ≤Φλwhere Ψ λ=λr(φ1+φ2
1+β
1) is a subsolution of ( ˜Pλ).
Then there exists a global maximal solution for ( ˜Pλ) within the ordered interval
[Ψλ,Φλ].
We now prove that the solution of the following BVP
−∆pz−∆qz=λzσin Ω
z >0 in Ω (4.1)
z= 0 on∂Ω
is a global supersolution to ( ˜Pλ). The existence and uniqueness of the positive
solution of (4.1) can be proved via a global minimization technique and L emma 5.1.
Let us denote Φ λto be the unique solution of (4.1) and since −∆pΦλ−∆qΦλ≥

λ), Φλserves as a supersolution for ( ˜Pλ). Using the comparison principle
proved in Lemma 5.1, we can show that if uis any solution of ( ˜Pλ), thenu≤Φλ.
Thus, Φ λis a global supersolution of ( ˜Pλ).
Proof of Theorem 1.3: We ﬁrst show that for large λ, Ψλ≤Φλin Ω. Since Ψ λ
is a positive subsolution of ( ˜Pλ), we have,

and Ψ λ= 0 on∂Ω, i.e, Ψ λis a positive subsolution of (4.1) also. Consequently, by
lemma 5.1, we have Ψ λ≤Φλin Ω forλ>>1.
Now Theorem 1.1 ensures the existence of a positive maximal solution for the
problem( ˜Pλ) within the orderedinterval[Ψ λ,Φλ]. Let us callthis maximalsolution
uλ. Again ifuis any other positive solution of ( ˜Pλ), then Lemma 5.1 gives u≤Φλ
inΩ. By the construction of uλ, clearlyu≤uλi.e ,uλis the global maximal
solution of ( ˜Pλ).
Next suppose λis small enough and there exists a positive solution uλfor (˜Pλ).
Sinceλ/mapsto→Φλis monotone increasing, so there exists some M >0 such that in Ω,

Letvλbe the solution of

Then by weak comparison principle, uλ≤vλin Ω. Now by Proposition 10 of [37],
asλ→0+,vλ→0 inC1

must be negative which is a contradiction. This completes the proof o f Theorem

Now to get a deeper understanding of the solution of equation (4.1) we deﬁne
˜Φλ:=λ−1

˜Φλ= 0 on∂Ω (4.3)

M0>0, independent of λ, such that /ba∇dbl˜Φλ/ba∇dblLp(Ω)≤M0. The uniform L∞upper
bound we obtain here is true for any 1 <q<p< ∞.
Lemma 4.3. There exists a positive constant M, independent of λ, such that
/ba∇dbl˜Φλ/ba∇dbl∞≤M.
Proof.We adapt the idea of De Giorgi - Stampachia iteration method to obta in
the uniform L∞estimate. First of all we deﬁne v(λ):=ǫ0˜Φλwhereǫ0=δ1

Then, 0 ≤wk≤ |v|+ 1 in Ω and wk= 0 on∂Ω.Clearly,wk∈W1,p

wk+1≤wk,∀k∈N. Also we note that lim k→∞wk= (v−1)+and so by Lebesgue

Now deﬁne Ak:=Ck+1
Ck+1−Ck= 2k+1−1, k∈N. Thenv < A kwkon the set

Now, as in (3.64) of Proposition 3.4 from [6], we get,

Using the above estimate in (4.5) we get

and since ˜Φλ>0 we have the required L∞estimate. /square
Theorem 4.4. LetΦλbe the solution of the equation as given in (4.1),2<q<p<
∞andλ0be a positive real number. Then there exist positive constan tsc1,c2,λ0
such that for all λ≥λ0and for all x∈Ω,
(4.9) c1λ1
p−1−σd(x)≤Φλ(x)≤c2λ1
p−1−σd(x).
Proof.From lemma 4.3, there exists a positive constant M1such that ˜Φσ
λ≤M1
a.e. in Ω. Let wbe the weak solution of
−∆pw−γ∆qw=M1in Ω
w= 0 on∂Ω
Therefore,byweakcomparisonprinciple, ˜Φλ(x)≤w(x),∀x∈Ω. Nowfollowingthe
ideas of the proof in Proposition 2.1 of [39], we get that for some posit ive constant
c2, independent of γ,and for allx∈Ω,˜Φλ(x)≤w(x)≤c2d(x).i.e
Φλ(x)≤c2λ1
p−1−σd(x) (4.10)
In order to obtain a lower bound we resonate some of the ideas used in Lemma 3.1.
Deﬁne

where 1< α <2,r0=1
p−1−σandφ1is the ﬁrst eigen function of −∆ such that
/ba∇dblφ1/ba∇dbl∞= 1.
Claim:ξλis a subsolution of (4.1) for some admissible range of λ.
Proceeding same as lemma 3.1 we get, for s=p,q,
(4.12) −∆sξλ=ǫs−1λr0(s−1)φα−2
1Ls(φ1)
whereLs(φ1) = (1+αφα−1

andsinces>2,thereexist δ>0andm>0suchthat Lp(φ1)<−mandLq(φ1)<0
in Ωδ. Therefore, ξλbeing non-negative by deﬁnition, we have,
(4.13) −∆pξλ−∆qξλ≤ −ǫs−1λr0(s−1)m
φ2−α
1≤λξσ
λin Ωδ
On the other hand, in Ω \Ωδ, there exists µ >0 such that φ1> µ. Then since
∆sφ1∈L∞(Ω) as 2<q<p, from (4.12) we get,
(4.14) −∆sξλ≤ǫs−1λr0(s−1)cs
µin Ω\Ωδ12 R. DHANYA, R. HARISH, SARBANI PRAMANIK
for some positive constants cs(which depends on sonly) andµ=µ2−α. Since in
Ω\Ωδ,φ1> µ, soξλ≥ǫλr0µand consequently ǫσλr0σµσ≤ξσ
λ.First we choose
ǫ∈(0,1) such that2csǫs−1−σ
µµσ≤1 fors=p,q. Also note that 1+ r0(σ−s+1)≥0
fors=p,q. Therefore from (4.14) we have for λ≥1,
−∆sξλ≤ǫs−1λr0(s−1)cs
µ≤λ
2(ǫσλr0σµσ)≤λξσ
λ

(4.15) ⇒ −∆pξλ−∆qξλ≤λξσ
λin Ω\Ωδ
Thus (4.13) and (4.15) together establish that for λ≥1,ξλis a positive subsolution
of (4.1). Again Φ λis deﬁned to be the positive solution of the same equation (4.1).
Then by the comparison lemma 5.1 we have for λ≥1,ξλ≤Φλor
Φλ≥ǫλr0(φ1+φα
1)≥ǫλ1
p−1−σφ1
Now since φ1is the ﬁrst eigenfunction of −∆, so taking λ0= 1, there exists a
positive constant c1such that for all λ≥λ0,
(4.16) c1λ1
p−1−σd(x)≤Φλ(x) for allx∈Ω.
Thus combining (4.10) and (4.16) we get the desired estimate.
