Abstract. LetGbe a connected semisimple real algebraic group. For
a Zariski dense Anosov subgroup Γ < Gwith respect to a parabolic
subgroupPθ, weprovethatanyΓ-Patterson-Sullivanmeasurechargesno
mass on any proper subvariety of G/Pθ. More generally, we prove that
for a Zariski dense θ-transverse subgroup Γ <G, any (Γ,ψ)-Patterson-
Sullivan measure charges no mass on any proper subvariety of G/Pθ,
provided the ψ-Poincar´ e series of Γ diverges at s= 1. In particular, our
result also applies to relatively Anosov subgroups.

Abe a maximal real split torus of Gand seta= LieA. Fix a positive Weyl
chamber a+<aand a maximal compact subgroup K < Gsuch that the
Cartan decomposition G=K(expa+)Kholds. We denote by µ(g)∈athe
Cartan projection of g∈G, that is, the unique element of a+such that
g∈Kexp(µ(g))K. Let Π be the set of simple roots for ( g,a+) and ﬁx a
non-empty subset θ⊂Π. LetPθbe the standard parabolic subgroup of G
corresponding to θand set
Fθ=G/Pθ.
Let Γ< Gbe a Zariski dense discrete subgroup. Denote by Λ θ⊂ Fθ
the limit set of Γ, which is the unique Γ-minimal subset of Fθ[1]. Let

where|γ|denotes the word length of γwith respect to a ﬁxed ﬁnite gener-
ating set of Γ. A θ-Anosov subgroup is necessarily a word hyperbolic group
[11, Theorem 1.5, Corollary 1.6]. The notion of Anosov subgr oups was ﬁrst
introduced by Labourie for surface groups [15], and was exte nded to general
word hyperbolic groups by Guichard-Wienhard [8]. Several e quivalent char-
acterizations have been established, one of which is the abo ve deﬁnition (see
[7] [9] [10] [11]). Anosov subgroups are regarded as natural generalizations
of convex cocompact subgroups of rank one groups, and includ e the images
of Hitchin representations and of maximal representations as well as higher
rank Schottky subgroups; see ([23], [12]).
A special case of our main theorem is the following non-conce ntration
property of Patterson-Sullivan measures for θ-Anosov subgroups:
Theorem 1.1. LetΓ<Gbe a Zariski dense θ-Anosov subgroup. For any
Γ-Patterson-Sullivan measure νonFθ, we have
ν(S) = 0
for any proper subvariety SofFθ.
Remark 1.2.This was proved by Flaminio-Spatzier [6] for G= SO(n,1),
n≥2, andbyEdwards-Lee-Oh[5]when θ= Πandtheoppositioninvolution
ofGis trivial (2.1).
Indeed, we work with a more general class of discrete subgrou ps, called
θ-transverse subgroups. Denote by i the opposition involuti on ofG(see
(2.1)).
Deﬁnition 1.3. A discrete subgroup Γ <Gis calledθ-transverse if
•it isθ-regular, i.e., liminf γ∈Γα(µ(γ)) =∞for allα∈θ; and
•it isθ-antipodal , i.e., if any two distinct ξ,η∈Λθ∪i(θ)are in general
position.
Sincei(µ(g)) =µ(g−1) for allg∈G, it follows that Γ is θ-transverseif and
only if Γ is i( θ)-transverse. The class of θ-transverse subgroups includes all
discretesubgroupsofrankoneLiegroups, θ-Anosovsubgroupsandrelatively
θ-Anosov subgroups.
Letpθ:a→aθbe the projection which is invariant under all Weyl
elements ﬁxing aθpointwise, and set µθ=pθ◦µ. A linear form ψ∈a∗
θis
said to be (Γ ,θ)-proper if the composition ψ◦µθ: Γ→[−ε,∞) is a proper
mapforsome ε>0. Thefollowing is ourmaintheorem fromwhich Theorem
1.1 is deduced by applying Selberg’s lemma [21].NON-CONCENTRATION PROPERTY OF PATTERSON-SULLIVAN MEASUR ES 3

transverse subgroup. Let ψ∈a∗
θbe a(Γ,θ)-proper linear form such that/summationtext

For aθ-Anosov Γ, the existence of a (Γ ,ψ)-Patterson-Sullivan measure
implies that ψis (Γ,θ)-proper and/summationtext
γ∈Γe−ψ(µθ(γ))=∞([16], [20]). There-

Added to the proof: The growth indicator ψθ

of the classical critical exponent of Γ ([18], [13]). For a Za riski dense θ-
transverse subgroup and a (Γ ,θ)-properψ∈a∗
θ, the existence of a (Γ ,ψ)-
conformal measure implies that ψis bounded from below by ψθ
Γ([19, Theo-

γ∈Γe−sψ(µθ(γ))is equal to 1, and a recent work [3, Theorem 1.1]

2.Ergodic properties of Patterson-Sullivan measures
LetGbe a connected semisimple real algebraic group. Let P < Gbe
a minimal parabolic subgroup with a ﬁxed Langlands decompos itionP=
MAN,whereAis a maximal real split torus of G,Mis a maximal compact
subgroup commuting with A, andNthe unipotent radical of P. We ﬁx a
positive Weyl chamber a+⊂a= LieAso that log Nconsists of positive
root subspaces. Recall that K < Gdenotes a maximal compact subgroup
such that the Cartan decomposition G=K(expa+)Kholds and denote by
µ:G→a+the Cartan projection, i.e., µ(g)∈a+is the unique element
such thatg∈Kexp(µ(g))Kforg∈G. Letw0∈Kbe an element of
the normalizer of Asuch that Ad w0a+=−a+. The opposition involution
i :a→ais deﬁned by
i(u) =−Adw0(u) foru∈a. (2.1)
Note thatµ(g−1) = i(µ(g)) for allg∈G.
Let Π denote the set of all simple roots for ( g,a+). Fix a non-empty
subsetθ⊂Π. LetP−
θandP+
θbe a pair of opposite standard parabolic
subgroups of Gcorresponding to θ; herePθ:=P−
θis chosen to contain P.

We also write Fθ=F−
θfor simplicity. We set P=PΠandF=FΠ. Since
P+
θis conjugate to Pi(θ), we have Fi(θ)=F+
θ. We sayξ∈ Fθandη∈ Fi(θ)
are in general position if ( ξ,η)∈G(P−
θ,P+
θ) under the diagonal G-action
onFθ×Fi(θ). We write
F(2)
θ=G(P−

which is the unique open G-orbit in Fθ×Fi(θ).
Letaθ=/intersectiontext

of the Weyl group ﬁxing aθpointwise. Set µθ:=pθ◦µ.
Thea-valued Busemann map β:F ×G×G→ais deﬁned as follows: for
ξ∈ Fandg,h∈G,
βξ(g,h) :=σ(g−1,ξ)−σ(h−1,ξ)
whereσ(g−1,ξ)∈aistheuniqueelementsuchthat g−1k∈Kexp(σ(g−1,ξ))N

aθ-valued Busemann map βθ:Fθ×G×G→aθas
βθ
ξ(g,h) :=pθ(βkP(g,h))∈aθ; (2.2)
this is well-deﬁned [19, Section 6].
In the rest of this section, let Γ < Gbe a Zariski dense θ-transverse
subgroup as in Deﬁnition 1.3. For a (Γ ,θ)-proper linear form ψ∈a∗
θ, we
denote byδψ∈(0,∞] the abscissa of convergence of the series Pψ(s) :=/summationtext
γ∈Γe−sψ(µθ(γ)); this is well-deﬁned [13, Lemma 4.2]. We set
Dθ
Γ:={ψ∈a∗
θ: (Γ,θ)-proper,δψ= 1 and Pψ(1) =∞}.
Note thatψ◦i can be regarded as a linear form on ai(θ). Using the property
that i(µ(g)) =µ(g−1) for allg∈G, we deduce that Pψ=Pψ◦iand hence
ψ∈ Dθ

Theθ-limit set Λ θof Γ is the unique Γ-minimal subset of Fθ[1]. We also

3.A property of convergence group actions
In this section, we prove a certain property of convergence g roup actions
which we will need in the proof of our main theorem in the next s ection.
We refer to [2] for basic properties of convergence group act ions. Let Γ be
a countable group acting on a compact metrizable space X(with #X≥3)
by homeomorphisms. This action is called a convergence group action if
for any sequence of distinct elements γn∈Γ, there exist a subsequence
γnkanda,b∈Xsuch that as k→ ∞,γnk(x) converges to afor allx∈
X−{b}, uniformly on compact subsets. In this case, we say Γ acts on Xas a
convergence group , which we supposein the following. Any element γ∈Γ of
inﬁnite order ﬁxes precisely one or two points of X, andγis called parabolic
or loxodromic accordingly. In that case, there exist aγ,bγ∈X, ﬁxed byγ,
such thatγn|X−{bγ}→aγuniformly on compact subsets as n→ ∞. We
haveγloxodromic if and only if aγ/ne}ationslash=bγ, in which case aγandbγare called
the attracting and repelling ﬁxed points of γrespectively.
We will use the following lemma in the next section:
Lemma 3.1. LetΓbe a torsion-free countable group acting on a compact
metric space Xas a convergence group. For any compact subset WofX
with at least two points, the subgroup ΓW={γ∈Γ :γW=W}acts on
X−Wproperly discontinuously, that is, for any η∈X−W, there exists an
open neighborhood Uofηsuch thatγU∩U/ne}ationslash=∅forγ∈ΓWimpliesγ=e.
Proof.Suppose not. Then there exist η∈X−W, a decreasing sequence
of open neighborhoods UnofηinXwith/intersectiontext
nUn={η}and a sequence
e/ne}ationslash=γn∈Γ such that γnW=WandγnUn∩Un/ne}ationslash=∅for eachn∈N. Hence
thereexists a sequence ηn∈Un∩γ−1
nUn; soηn→ηandγnηn→ηasn→ ∞.
We claim that the elements γnare all pairwise distinct, possibly after
passing to a subsequence. Otherwise, it would mean that, aft er passing to
a subsequence, γn’s are constant sequence, say γn=γ/ne}ationslash=e. Sinceγη=
limnγnηn=η,ηmust be a ﬁxed point of γ. Since Γ is torsion-free, γis
either parabolic or loxodromic, and in particular it has at m ost two ﬁxed
points inX, including η. Sinceη/ne}ationslash∈WandWhas at least two points, we
can takew∈Wwhich is not ﬁxed by γ. Then asn→+∞,γnw→ηor
γ−nw→η. SinceWis a compact subset such that γW=Wandη /∈W,
this yields a contradiction.
Therefore we may assume that {γn}is an inﬁnite sequence of distinct
elements. Since the action of Γ on Xis a convergence group action, there
exist a subsequence γnkanda,b∈Xsuch that as k→ ∞,γnk(x) converges
toafor allx∈X−{b}, uniformly on compact subsets. There are two cases
to consider. Suppose that b=η. ThenW⊂X−{b}, and hence γnkW→a
uniformly as k→ ∞. SinceγnkW=WandWis a compact subset, it
follows that W={a}, contradicting the hypothesis that Wconsists of at
least two elements. Now suppose that b/ne}ationslash=η. Sinceηnkconverges to η,
we may assume that ηnk/ne}ationslash=bfor allk. Noting that # W≥2, we can take6 DONGRYUL M. KIM AND HEE OH
w0∈W−{b}. If we now consider the following compact subset
W0:={ηnk:k∈N}∪{η,w0} ⊂X−{b},
we then have γnkW0→auniformly as k→ ∞. Sinceηnk∈W0for eachk
andγnkηnk→ηask→ ∞, we must have
a=η.
On the other hand, since w0∈W0∩W,γnkw0→ηask→ ∞. This
impliesη∈WsinceWis compact and γnkw0∈W, yielding a contradiction
to the hypothesis η /∈W. This completes the proof. /square
We denote by Λ Xthe set of all accumulation points of a Γ-orbit in X.
If #ΛX≥3, the Γ-action is called non-elementary and Λ Xis the unique
Γ-minimal subset [2].
A well-known example of a convergence group action is given b y a word
hyperbolic group Γ. Fix a ﬁnite symmetric generating subset SΓof Γ. A
geodesic ray in Γ is an inﬁnite sequence ( γi)∞
i=0of elements of Γ such that
γ−1
iγi+1∈SΓfor alli≥0. The Gromov boundary ∂Γ is the set of equiv-
alence classes of geodesic rays, where two rays are equivale nt to each other
if and only if their Hausdorﬀ distance is ﬁnite. The group Γ ac ts on∂Γ by
γ·[(γi)] = [(γγi)]. This action is known to be a convergence group action
[2, Lemma 1.11].
Another important example of a convergence group action is t he action
of aθ-transverse subgroup Γ on Λ θ∪i(θ):
Proposition 3.2. [10, Theorem 4.21] For aθ-transverse subgroup Γ, the
action of ΓonΛθ∪i(θ)is a convergence group action.
4.Non-concentration property
We ﬁxanon-empty subset θ⊂Π. We ﬁrstprovethefollowing proposition
from which we will deduce Theorem 1.4.
Proposition 4.1. LetΓ< Gbe a torsion-free Zariski dense discrete sub-
group admitting a convergence group action on a compact metr izable space
X. We assume that this action is θ-antipodal in the sense that there exist
Γ-equivariant homeomorphisms fθ: ΛX→Λθandfi(θ): ΛX→Λi(θ)such
that for any ξ/ne}ationslash=ηinΛX,

Letνbe aΓ-quasi-invariant measure on Λθsuch that
(1)νis non-atomic;
(2) Γacts ergodically on (Λ(2)
θ,(ν×νi)|Λ(2)
θ)for some Γ-quasi-invariant
measureνionΛi(θ).
Then for any proper algebraic subset SofFθ, we have
ν(S) = 0.NON-CONCENTRATION PROPERTY OF PATTERSON-SULLIVAN MEASUR ES 7
Proof.We ﬁrst claim that the Γ-action on (Λ θ×Λi(θ),ν×νi) is ergodic. Set
R:= (Λθ×Λi(θ))−Λ(2)
θ. Since the Γ-action on (Λ(2)
θ,(ν×νi)|Λ(2)
θ) is ergodic,
it suﬃces to show that
(ν×νi)(R) = 0.
Fory∈Λi(θ), letR(y) :={x∈Λθ: (x,y)∈R}. By the antipodal property
of the pair ( fθ,fi(θ)), we have that for each y∈Λi(θ), we haveR(y) =∅or
R(y) ={(fθ◦f−1
i(θ))(y)}and henceν(R(y)) = 0 by the non-atomicity of ν.
Therefore
(ν×νi)(R) =/integraldisplay
y∈Λi(θ)ν(R(y))dνi(y) = 0, (4.1)
proving the claim.
Now suppose that ν(S)>0 for some proper algebraic subset S⊂ Fθ. We
may assume that Sis irreducible and of minimal dimension among all such
algebraic subsets of Fθ. LetW=f−1
θ(S∩Λθ)⊂ΛX. Sinceνis non-atomic
andν(S)>0, we have # W=∞>2. This implies #Λ X≥3. By the
property of a non-elementary convergence group action, Λ Xis the unique
Γ-minimal subset of Xand there always exists a loxodromic element of Γ
[2].
Since Γ<Gis Zariski dense, Λ θis Zariski dense in Fθas well, and hence
Λθ/ne}ationslash⊂S. Therefore X−Wisanon-emptyopensubsetintersecting Λ X. Since
Γ acts minimally on Λ Xand the set of attracting ﬁxed points of loxodromic
elements of Γ is a non-empty Γ-invariant subset, there exist s a loxodromic
elementγ0∈Γ whose attracting ﬁxed point aγ0is contained in Λ X−W.
Hence applying Lemma 3.1 to η=aγ0, we have an open neighborhood Uof
aγ0in ΛXsuch that
γU∩U=∅ (4.2)
for all non-trivial γ∈Γ withγW=W.
Sinceγm
0|ΛX−{bγ0}→aγ0uniformly on compact subsets as m→+∞and
#ΛX≥3,Ucontains a point ξ∈ΛX−{aγ0,bγ0}. By replacing γ0by a large
powerγm
0if necessary, we can ﬁnd an open neighborhood Vofξcontained
inU−{aγ0}such thatγ0V⊂Uandγ0V∩V=∅.
We now consider the subset
S×fi(θ)(V)
ofFθ× Fi(θ). Sinceν(S)>0 andνi(fi(θ)(V))>0, we have that Γ( S×
fi(θ)(V)) has fullν×νi-measure by the ergodicity of the Γ-action on (Λ θ×
Λi(θ),ν×νi). Since (ν×νi)(S×γ0fi(θ)(V))>0, there exists γ∈Γ such that
(ν×νi)/parenleftbig
(S×γ0fi(θ)(V))∩(γS×γfi(θ)(V)/parenrightbig
>0.
In particular, we have
ν(S∩γS)>0 andνi(γ0fi(θ)(V)∩γfi(θ)(V))>0.8 DONGRYUL M. KIM AND HEE OH
SinceSwaschosentobeofminimaldimensionandirreducibleamongp roper
algebraicsetswithpositive ν-measure, wemusthave S=γS. Itfollows from
the Γ-invariance of Λ θthatW=γW.
The Γ-equivariance of fi(θ)implies that
νi(fi(θ)(γ0V∩γV))>0. (4.3)
Sinceγ0V∩V=∅, we haveγ/ne}ationslash=e. Hence it follows from V⊂U,γ0V⊂U
and the choice (4.2) of Uthat
γ0V∩γV⊂U∩γU=∅,
which gives a contradiction to (4.3). This ﬁnishes the proof . /square
Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let Γ< Gbe a Zariski dense θ-transverse sub-
group and νa (Γ,ψ)-Patterson-Sullivan measure for a (Γ ,θ)-proper linear
formψ∈a∗

γ∈Γe−ψ(µθ(γ))=∞. We may assume without loss
of generality that Γ is torsion-free. Indeed, let Γ 0<Γ be a torsion-free sub-
group of ﬁnite index. Then Γ 0is also a Zariski dense θ-transverse subgroup
ofG. Moreover, νis a (Γ 0,ψ)-Patterson-Sullivan measure since the limit
sets for Γ and Γ 0are same. Write Γ =/uniontextn
i=1γiΓ0for someγ1,···,γn∈Γ.
By [1, Lemma 4.6], there exists C >0 such that /bardblµ(γiγ)−µ(γ)/bardbl ≤Cfor all
γ∈Γ0andi= 1,···n. Hence we have that ψis (Γ0,θ)-proper as well and

γ∈Γ0e−ψ(µθ(γ))=
∞. Therefore, replacing Γ by Γ 0, we assume that Γ is torsion-free. By
Proposition 3.2, the action of Γ on Λ θ∪i(θ)is a convergence group action.
Since there exists a (Γ ,ψ)-conformal measure, we have δψ≤1 by [13,
Lemma 7.3]. Therefore the hypothesis/summationtext
γ∈Γe−ψ(µθ(γ))=∞implies that
ψ∈ Dθ
Γ. Moreover, the θ-antipodality of Γ implies that the canonical pro-
jections
fθ: Λθ∪i(θ)→Λθandfi(θ): Λθ∪i(θ)→Λi(θ)
are Γ-equivariant θ-antipodal homeomorphisms [13, Lemma 9.5]. This im-
plies that Theorem 2.1 indeed holds for a general θwithout the hypothesis
θ= i(θ). Henceν=νψ,νψis non-atomic and the diagonal Γ-action on
(Λ(2)
θ,(νψ×νψ◦i)|Λ(2)
θ) is ergodic. Since νψ◦iis Γ-conformal, it is Γ-quasi-
invariant. Therefore Theorem 1.4 follows from Proposition 4.1.
We emphasize again that Lemma 3.1 and Proposition 4.1 were in troduced
to deal with the case wheni is non-trivial. Indeed, wheni is t rivial, Theorem
1.4 follows from the following θ-version of [5, Theorem 9.3].
Theorem 4.2. LetΓ< Gbe a Zariski dense discrete subgroup. Let νbe
aΓ-quasi-invariant measure on Λθ. Suppose that the diagonal Γ-action onNON-CONCENTRATION PROPERTY OF PATTERSON-SULLIVAN MEASUR ES 9
(Λθ×Λθ,ν×ν)is ergodic. Then for any proper algebraic subset SofFθ,
we have
ν(S) = 0.
Proof.The proof is identical to the proof of [5, Theorem 9.3] except that we
work with a general θ. We reproduce it here for the convenience of readers.
LetSbe a proper irreducible subvariety of Fθwithν(S)>0 and of minimal
dimension. Since ( ν×ν)(S×S)>0, the Γ-ergodicity of ν×νimplies that
(ν×ν)(Γ(S×S)) = 1. It follows that for any γ0∈Γ, there exists γ∈Γ such
that (S×γ0S)∩(γS×γS) has positive ν×ν-measure; hence ν(S∩γS)>0
andν(γ0S∩γS)>0. SinceSis irreducible and of minimal dimension, it
follows that S=γS=γ0S. Sinceγ0∈Γ was arbitrary, we have Γ S=S,
contradicting the Zariski density hypothesis on Γ. /square
We ﬁnally mention that the proof of Proposition 4.1 implies t he following
when the second measure cannot be taken to the same as the ﬁrst measure:
Theorem 4.3. LetΓ< Gbe a Zariski dense torsion-free discrete sub-
group acting on Λθas a convergence group. Let νbe a non-atomic Γ-quasi-
invariant measure on Λθ. Suppose that the diagonal Γ-action on (Λθ×Λθ,ν×
ν′)is ergodic for some Γ-quasi-invariant measure ν′onΛθ. Then for any
proper algebraic subset SofFθ, we have
ν(S) = 0.
Proof.Since Γ acts ergodically on the entire product space (Λθ×Λθ,ν×ν′),
the ﬁrst part of the proof of Proposition 4.1 is not relevant. Suppose that S
is an irreducible proper subvariety of Fθand of minimal dimension among
all subvarieties with positive ν-measure. Then setting W=S∩Λθ, as in
the proof of Proposition 4.1, we can ﬁnd non-empty open subse tsV⊂U⊂
Λθ−Wsuch thatγU∩U=∅for all non-trivial γ∈Γ withγW=W, and
γ0V⊂Uandγ0V∩V=∅for someγ0∈Γ. Using (ν×ν′)(S×V)>0, we
then get a contradiction by the same argument in loc. cit. /square
