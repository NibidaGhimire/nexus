Abstract
Installing more base stations (BSs) into the existing cellular infrastructure is an essential way to
provide greater network capacity and higher data rate in the 5th-generation cellular networks (5G).
However, a non-negligible amount of population is concerned that such network densiﬁcation will
generate a notable increase in exposure to electric and magnetic ﬁelds (EMF) over the territory. In this
paper, we analyze the downlink, uplink, and joint downlink&uplink exposure induced by the radiation
from BSs and personal user equipment (UE), respectively, in terms of the received power density and
exposure index. In our analysis, we consider the EMF restrictions set by the regulatory authorities
such as the minimum distance between restricted areas (e.g., schools and hospitals) and BSs, and the
maximum permitted exposure. Exploiting tools from stochastic geometry, mathematical expressions for
the coverage probability and statistical EMF exposure are derived and validated. Tuning the system
parameters such as the BS density and the minimum distance from a BS to restricted areas, we show
a trade-off between reducing the population’s exposure to EMF and enhancing the network coverage
performance. Then, we formulate optimization problems to maximize the performance of the EMF-
aware cellular network while ensuring that the EMF exposure complies with the standard regulation
limits with high probability. For instance, the exposure from BSs is two orders of magnitude less than
the maximum permissible level when the density of BSs is less than 20BSs/km2.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The fundamental requirements of 5th-generation cellular network (5G) are low latency, high
throughput, and wide coverage. One potential solution to accommodate 5G key performance
indicators (KPIs) is to increase the number of base stations (BSs) [1]. The new 5G BSs inevitably
act as additional radiation sources, concerning some of the population about the increasing
possibility of their exposure to electric and magnetic ﬁelds (EMF). Recently, human health
related to the massive deployment of BSs has raised public concerns [2]. There is an urgent
need to provide scientiﬁc analysis as we do not know if health effects (not known at present
time) will be observed in the future.
EMF exposure in cellular networks mainly comes from BSs and user equipment (UE), related
to passive exposure and active exposure, respectively. BSs emit high power through long distances
in the downlink, imposing EMF exposure to humans passively. The EMF exposure from all BSs
in the network is usually measured by the power density at the user, which can be easily
transformed into electric strength [3]. Nevertheless, the exposure originating from UE with low
transmit power should also be taken into account due to the close distance between the user
and the personal mobile device, which can be quantiﬁed by the received power density or the
speciﬁc absorption rate (SAR) [4], [5]. In fact, EMF exposure associated with 5G radio frequency
(RF) communications is considered as non-ionizing radiation that does not have enough energy
to ionize the cells [6]. Nevertheless, the non-ionizing radiation is possible to generate heating
effects in the exposed tissues, i.e., thermal effects [7], [8]. In order to guarantee that the thermal
effects are below acceptable safe levels, EMF exposure guidelines are set such as those by
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) [9], International Commission on Non-Ionizing
Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) [4], and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [10]. Each
country has its own regulations on the safety limits to the EMF [11]–[15], mainly based on
the aforementioned regulatory guidelines. Besides these guidelines, as a further precautionary
measure, some countries adopt more restricted conditions such as a minimum distance between
BSs and restricted areas, e.g., schools and hospitals [16]. Besides the well-understood thermal
effects, there is a debate about whether long-term exposure to radiofrequency radiation (RFR)3
may have non-thermal effects that can lead to health issues [17], [18]. Therefore, accurate analysis
of the exposure to EMF is essential to permit designing EMF-aware cellular networks.
A. Related Work
In this subsection, we discuss the most related work on the EMF exposure, which can be
divided into two categories: (i) EMF exposure assessment and (ii) EMF-aware network design.
EMF exposure assessment. The evaluation of EMF exposure in cellular networks can be
conducted from experimental measurement and analytical points of view. As for the exper-
imental measurement, the exposure induced by BSs and UEs was measured in [19], which
revealed that the exposure from a personal mobile device could not be ignored. Considering the
enabling technologies of 5G such as massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), real-time
beamforming, and high-frequency bands, 5G smartphones were used to capture the exposure
level in a 5G network [20]. In [21], the distribution of EMF in 5G networks is investigated.
The authors in [22] focused on the measurement of downlink exposure and showed that the
exposure is well below the ICNIRP reference level. Clearly, the experimental measurement of
EMF exposure illustrates the RFR level under a speciﬁc cellular network, while it is not able to
explore the effect of the system parameters on EMF exposure for cellular network deployment.
As for the analytical evaluation of EMF exposure, authors in [23] considered a regular
deployment of BSs under the assumption of a hexagonal mosaic territory. Employing stochastic
geometry, more realistic modeling of irregularly distributed BSs was given in [24]. Compared
with the experimental data of exposure in Brussels, Belgium, authors in [24] optimized the
model parameters and veriﬁed the ﬁtting effect of the proposed model. In [25], the statistical
received power at users was used to monitor the downlink exposure levels in a MIMO system
using tools from stochastic geometry. The above analytical modelling allows the prediction of
the downlink EMF exposure from BSs before the actual network deployment. Yet, the uplink
exposure from mobile equipment and EMF restrictions such as the minimum distance between
BSs and restricted areas have not been considered in those analytical models. Thus, these models
do not lead to an accurate evaluation of total EMF exposure in real cellular networks.
EMF-aware network design. Recently, several researchers proposed novel cellular architectures
to reduce EMF exposure or improve coverage performance while limiting the exposure [26].
Reconﬁgurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) were ﬁrst proposed in [27] as a solution to create areas
with reduced EMF. In [28], the RIS phases were optimized to minimize the total uplink exposure4
of users. On the other hand, the work in [29] and [30] considered designing the RIS phases to
minimize the maximum exposure (min-max problem) with instantaneous and statistical channel
state information, respectively. The authors in [31] applied probabilistic shaping to minimize the
average EMF exposure while ensuring a target throughput. Considering the coexistence of macro-
cell and small-cell BSs, the downlink EMF exposure and the coverage probability are studied
in [32]. It is worth noting that the existing research on the EMF-aware network design mainly
aims at mitigating the downlink/uplink EMF exposure on average and ensuring a target quality
of service (QoS). Nevertheless, the total exposure (including downlink and uplink exposure) is
rarely taken into account when designing the cellular network despite the fact that people are
exposed to the RFR from both BSs and UEs [33]. Moreover, the regulation of restricted areas
is seldom considered in the EMF-aware network design; while this regulation is essential for
the evaluation of EMF exposure levels since the minimum distance between BSs and restricted
areas can signiﬁcantly reduce the exposure levels in restricted areas and can be selected by the
system designers or decision makers. The effect of restricted areas on network performance has
not been studied.
B. Contributions
In this paper, we provide a novel framework to analyze the impact of EMF exposure from both
BSs and UE on the planning of a 5G cellular network from a statistical point of view. In particular,
the proposed cellular network model considers the restrictions on the EMF exposure set by the
regulatory authorities, including the maximum permitted EMF exposure and the exclusion zones
around restricted areas, e.g., hospitals and schools [16]. Three scenarios are mainly studied in
our model, including the downlink (passive exposure), the uplink (active exposure), and the joint
downlink&uplink (passive and active exposure) RFR. Nevertheless, the inclusion of the restricted
area, the maximum transmit power of the power with different channel inversion coefﬁcients at
UE, and the combination of the uplink and downlink lead to some mathematical challenges. These
challenges are handled through approximations such as Poisson hole process (PHP), which are
shown to be accurate through Monte Carlo simulations. The main contributions of our work are
summarized as follows.
We propose a stochastic geometry model that captures the minimum distance ( R) between a
BS and a restricted area. Speciﬁcally, restricted areas result in the PHP-distributed BSs. Such5
PHP approximation enables the following analysis of the effect of Ron the exposure and
coverage performance. The accuracy of the approximation has been validated in simulation.
We quantify the downlink exposure from BSs and the uplink exposure from personal UE
by the received power density under the Nakagami- mfading model. Correspondingly, we
analyze the coverage probability in the downlink and uplink, respectively. Furthermore,
considering a more practical scenario that people are exposed to radiation from both BSs
and UE, we provide the joint downlink&uplink exposure analysis, referred to as exposure
index.
We assess the compliance of cellular networks to the exposure guidelines. As opposed to
the mean-value-based measurement of EMF exposure, our work provides the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of exposure by using the Gil-Pelaez theorem. By comparing
the95-th percentile of EMF level with the standard limit deﬁned by FCC, we ensure that
the EMF exposure level complies with guidelines with a high probability.
We design the system parameters, e.g., the density of the BSs and the minimum distance
between the restricted areas and BSs, to (i)maximize the coverage performance constrained
by the 95-th percentile of EMF exposure in the downlink and to (ii)minimize the joint
downlink&uplink exposure. Numerical results show the impact of system parameters on
network performance and exposure, and there exist optimal values of system parameters
with respect to the minimal total exposure. These analyses provide insights into the design
of future networks to meet the QoS and safety requirements.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Sec. II introduces the system model. The
downlink analysis of the statistical EMF and SNR-based coverage probability are given in
Sec. III, including the design of system parameters. Similar performance metrics in the uplink are
presented in Sec. IV. Sec. V adopts exposure index to consider the total inﬂuence of both uplink
exposure and downlink exposure on the population. Then, the simulation results are shown and
discussed in Sec. VI. Finally, Sec. VII concludes the paper.
II. S YSTEM MODEL
This section describes the considered system of a cellular network with the EMF-deployment
constraint and corresponding stochastic geometry-based model.
We investigate a network composed of BSs and UEs, which are equipped with omnidirectional
antennas. In fact, the case of directional antennas can be handled under the proposed framework6

with the scaled density of BSs and antenna gain [34]. Particularly, the deployment of BSs
complies with the EMF regulation on the minimum distance between BSs and the restricted
areas (such as schools and hospitals). As shown in Fig. 1(a), there are several restricted areas
surrounded by exclusion zones/holes where BSs are not allowed (by EMF regulation) to be
deployed [16]. The radius of the exclusion zones/holes, denoted by R, can be regarded as the
minimum distance between BSs and the restricted areas. Using tools from stochastic geometry,
the locations of BSs and users are generally assumed to follow two independent homogeneous
PPPs [35]. However, considering the exclusion zones around restricted areas, we propose to
model the locations of the BSs as a PHP. The PHP is generated using two independent PPPs:7
1) the baseline PPP 	bfbigR2with density b.
2) the PPP modeling the locations of the restricted areas, which represent the centers of the
exclusion zones (i.e., holes), 	rfrigR2with density r.
Therefore, the locations of the BSs construct a PHP 	B, formally deﬁned as follows
	B=(
bi2	b:bi=2[
ri2	rB(ri;R))
; (1)
whereB(ri;R)is an exclusion zone/hole, a disk centered at riwith radius R. The density of
	Bcan be approximated as
B=bexp( rR2): (2)
Fig. 1(b) presents a realization of PHP-distributed BSs, marked by triangles with solid black
borders. BSs that fall in the exclusion zones (i.e. green circles) are removed and become dashed
triangles. Besides, a BS only serves a single UE in each time-frequency recourse block. The
nearest association rule is considered for the connection between BSs and users, i.e., a user is
connected with its nearest BS. Without loss of generality, we focus on the analysis on a typical
user located at the origin of the network [36]. Due to the limitation of the restricted areas, the
location of the typical user (inside/outside the exclusion zone) impacts its performance. Therefore,
in the following, we distinguish the analysis of the typical user in two different locations: outside
or inside the exclusion zone, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
III. EMF- AWARE DOWNLINK EXPOSURE
In this section, the downlink performance metrics are derived to characterize the statistics
of the EMF exposure, the coverage probability, and the allowable distance between a BS and a
user. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the downlink coverage probability
subject to the EMF exposure constraint.
A. Performance Metrics: Downlink Exposure and Coverage
The downlink EMF exposure is quantiﬁed by the received power density from all BSs over
the territory. Following the system model discussed in Sec. II, the output power of a BS is
p=PtGt; (3)8
wherePtis the transmit power of the BS and Gtis the antenna gain. Based on the Friis law,
the received power at the typical user from a BS with horizontal distance xiis given by
Prec(xi) =pGuHi
(x2
i+h2)=2; (4)
whereGuis the user’s antenna gain, = (c=f
4d0)2represents the path loss at reference distance
d0= 1 m (with frequency fand wave speed c= 3108m=s),his the height of BSs, 
is the path-loss exponent, and Hiis the small-scale fading gain with an expected value of 1,
i.e.,EfHig= 1. More speciﬁcally, we adopt the widely-used Nakagami- mfading model (with
shaping parameters given by m) to characterize the small-scale fading. The probability density
function (PDF) of Hiis given by [37]
fHi(!) =mm!m 1

where   (m) =1

density can be expressed as
W(xi) =Prec(xi)
Ae=pHi
4(x2
i+h2)=2; (6)
whereAe=(c=f)2Gu
4is the antenna effective area of the typical user. Since the BS height
is negligible compared with the horizontal distance xi, for simplicity, the Euclidean distance
between a BS and the typical user is approximated as their horizontal distance in the rest of the
paper. Hence, for the typical user located at the origin, the downlink EMF exposure is
WDL=X
i;bi2	BpHi
4x
i: (7)
For this setup, our objective is to ensure that the value of WDLis below the maximum allowed
value by regulatory authorities with a high probability [39], [40]. In particular, the below
condition (termed downlink EMF constraint) is required to be satisﬁed
P(WDLWmax); (8)
whereWmaxis the maximum power density speciﬁed by the guidelines. The value of can
be chosen as 0:95, according to the assessment of compliance regulation by ITU [39]. This is
opposed to the deterministic approaches where WDLis not considered as a random variable
(r.v.), and it should be strictly less than Wmax, i.e.,1[41].
From (4), when the typical user associates with its closest BS with a distance of x0, the9
received power in the downlink can be expressed as
PDL
rec(x0) =pH 0
x
0; (9)
where the BS height is ignored, Guis assumed to be 1, andis the path-loss exponent. The
instantaneous SNR in the downlink is given by
SNRDL=PDL
rec(x0)
2=pH 0
x
02; (10)
where2is noise power, and H0is the small-scale fading following (5). Note that the path-
loss exponent is represented by two different notations, i.e., and, for calculating the EMF
exposure and SNR, respectively, which enables us to analyze the worst case and the typical case
by setting different relations between and. For a given value of B, the downlink coverage
probability can be deﬁned as follows,
PDL
cov(B) =P(SNRDL>); (11)
whereis a predeﬁned threshold.
B. Performance Analysis
This subsection provides several steps to derive the mathematical expressions for the perfor-
mance metrics formally deﬁned in Sec. III-A from the perspective of the typical user outside or
inside the hole, respectively. For instance, considering that BSs are excluded from the exclusion
zones, the distance between the typical user located in the restricted area and its nearest BS
must be larger than the radius of the exclusion zone.
1)Distance Distribution to the Closest BS :LetXoutandXindenote the distance from the
typical user to its closest BS given that the user is outside or inside the hole, respectively. The
following lemma presents the distribution of the contact distances XoutandXin.
Lemma 1. The PDF of the distance between the typical user and the closest BS is denoted by

whereB=bexp( rR2), (12a) is for the user outside the hole, and (12b) is for the user
inside the hole.
Proof. See Appendix A.10
2)Coverage Probability :The probability that SNR is above a predeﬁned threshold, i.e., the
complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of SNR, is used as a metric to describe
QoS of the cellular network. Based on the distance distribution of XoutandXin, we develop the
expression of the downlink coverage probability relative to a SNR threshold .

3)EMF Constraint :The EMF exposure is required to be below the maximum allowed value
(Wmax) by the authority regulations with a high probability ( ). (8) can be rewritten in terms of
the CDF of the downlink power density, i.e., FWDL(w), as
FWDL(Wmax): (14)
Therefore, the EMF constraint can be expressed as

Proof. See Appendix C.
4)Compliance Distance Between Users and BSs :The distance between a BS and a user
should comply with the EMF constraint, i.e., conditioned on the serving BS located at a com-11
pliance distance xcto the typical user, the corresponding conditional EMF exposure should not
exceed the maximum allowable limit ( Wmax) with a high probability ( ). Namely,xcsatisﬁes
the conditional EMF constraint as follows,
FWDLjXout=xc(Wmax); (18)
whereFWDLjXout=xc(Wmax)is the CDF of the downlink EMF exposure conditioned on the
distance between the serving BS and the user being xc. The minimum value of xcthat satisﬁes

No public access is allowed to the area centered at a BS with the radius of xcom, since people

When setting w=Wmaxandas a constant deﬁned by the ITU, FWDLjx0(w)is a function
ofx0. Using its inverse function, we can ﬁnd the minimum compliance distance between a user
and a BS,xcom. Thus, the compliance distance is xcxcom.
C. Optimal EMF-aware Design
We try to maximize the downlink coverage probability while ensuring that the downlink EMF
constraint is always satisﬁed. This optimization problem can be formally deﬁned as follows,

Intuitively, the network would have better coverage performance as the BS density Bincreases
since the distance between the typical user and its closest BS becomes closer and the path loss is12
correspondingly reduced, thereby improving the downlink SNR. However, the EMF exposure is
expected to increase, which means the optimal density 
B(corresponding to a speciﬁc baseline

reachesWmax. Based on (2), increasing Bcan be realized by reducing the density and the
radius of holes or increasing the baseline density.
IV. EMF- AWARE UPLINK EXPOSURE
In this section, we focus on the EMF exposure induced by individual mobile equipment. We
deﬁne the uplink performance metrics and then provide corresponding analysis.
A. Performance Metrics: Uplink Exposure and Coverage
We now analyze the uplink exposure of the cellular network described in Sec. II. The mobile
equipment deploys a power control mechanism on its transmit power to compensate for the path
loss, fully or partially depending on the power control factor , i.e.,= 1 and0<  < 1,
respectively. The transmit power at the mobile equipment can be deﬁned as
PUL
tran(x0) =8
<
:pux
0; x 0<X max
pmax;otherwise;2(0;1]; (23)
wherepuis a constant, is the path-loss exponent, x0is the distance between the BS and
its serving user, pmaxis the maximum transmit power of the mobile equipment, and Xmax=
(pmax=pu)1=. Letu0denote the distance from the user to its personal mobile equipment and
assume that u0is in the far-ﬁled of the transmit antenna of mobile equipment.1The distance
from the BS to its associated user or mobile equipment is assumed to be equivalent since the
distance from the typical user to its own mobile device is much shorter than that to its serving
BS, i.e.,u0<<x 0. Unlike the downlink exposure that comes from all BSs in the network, the
uplink exposure is dominated by the user’s personal mobile equipment [42], [43]. Speciﬁcally,
the transmit power at mobile equipment is quite low and attenuates signiﬁcantly after long-
distance transmission. Therefore, the exposure from other users’ mobile devices to the typical
user is negligible. However, due to the close distance between the typical user and its own mobile
device, the corresponding exposure can not be ignored. Thus, the uplink EMF exposure at the

to be below the maximum permitted value by regulatory authorities with a high probability of

P(WULWmax): (25)

In particular, if = 1, it is a full power control case, and the average received power will be a
constant when x0<X max.
The corresponding instantaneous SNR in the uplink can be expressed as
SNRUL=PUL

which can be used to compute the uplink coverage probability as follows
PUL

whereBis givn in (2) and is the predeﬁned threshold.
B. Performance Analysis
Similar to the downlink case, we analyze the uplink exposure of the typical user inside and
outside the hole, respectively, and the uplink coverage probability. The distribution of the distance
between the typical user and its closest BS in Lemma 1 is still applicable to the following analysis.
1)Coverage Probability :The following theorem gives the expression of the coverage prob-
ability under the power control mechanism, which is deﬁned as the CCDF of the uplink SNR.14

2)EMF Constraint :The uplink EMF exposure at the typical user is mostly from its own
mobile equipment, which should be lower than the maximum allowed value by authority regula-
tions with a high probability. Similar to the downlink EMF constraint, (25) can be derived from
the Laplace transform of the uplink received power density, denoted by LWULas

Therefore, the uplink EMF constraint can be described by the inverse function of FWUL(w),

From above analysis, we notice that, under the power control mechanism, the closer distance
between the user and its serving BS leads to lower transmit power at its UE. Unlike what we
discussed in Sec. III-C, increasing the number of BSs is beneﬁcial for both the reduction on the
exposure and the improvement on the coverage probability in the uplink. Therefore, the uplink
optimization problem is omitted.
V. J OINT DOWNLINK &U PLINK EXPOSURE
In most situations, a person is exposed to EMF from both his/her own mobile equipment and
BSs. In this section, we consider a metric called exposure index that accounts for both the uplink
and downlink exposure in the cellular network discussed in Sec. II, followed by the performance
analysis and the optimal EMF-aware network design.15
A. Performance Metrics: Exposure Index
In [44], a metric that quantiﬁes the population exposure to EMF is introduced. This metric
considers both the uplink and downlink EMF exposure. It also accounts for user-speciﬁc prop-
erties such as age (adult or child), usage (data or voice call), and posture (standing or sitting).
The total exposure (termed exposure index) at the typical user can be expressed as the sum of
uplink exposure index ( EIUL) and downlink exposure index ( EIDL), which is given by [44]
EI(x0) = EIUL(x0) + EIDL= SARULPUL

B. Performance Analysis
The exposure index in (32) can be divided into two parts, i.e., one is related to the serving
BS atb0with distance x0and the other is from the rest of BS, as follows.

C. Optimal EMF-aware Design
As we mentioned before, increasing the density of BSs is effective to enhance the coverage
performance both in the downlink and uplink and reduce the uplink EMF exposure. On the
contrary, increasing the density of BSs has a negative inﬂuence on the downlink EMF exposure.17

Therefore, the proper design of Bis essential to minimize both the uplink and downlink
exposure. In the following, we formulate an optimization problem to ﬁnd the optimal density of

VI. N UMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, Monte Carlo simulations and numerical results for the analytical expressions
are conducted. The performance of the EMF-aware cellular network is investigated for three sce-
narios, i.e., the downlink, uplink, and joint downlink&uplink. The parameters used in numerical
results and their default values are given in Table. II. Some of them are swept to explore their
effects on the EMF exposure and coverage probability. Without loss of generality, we consider
the Nakagami- mfading with m= 1.
A. Worst-Case Scenario for Downlink Exposure
The downlink simulations are ﬁrstly conducted under the conservative setting, where we
consider the maximum transmit power ( 200 W ) and the maximum antenna gain ( 15 dB ) at
5G BSs [27, Table 6]. Based on the recommendation provided in 3GPP TR 36.814–900 [47],18

as a conservative setting, the path-loss exponent is set as = 4 while analyzing the downlink
coverage probability (by considering that the communication link is blocked) and as = 2:5
while computing the downlink EMF exposure (for the environment free of blockages).
In Fig. 2, we compare the statistical exposure level inside and outside the restricted area for
different minimum allowable distance between the BS and restricted areas, R. In particular, the
statistical level, denoted by F 1
WDL(), means that the exposure will not exceed this level with a
high probability of , as explained in (15). According to the compliance regulations [39], we
set= 0:95, andF 1
WDL(0:95)represents the 95-th percentile of exposure level in the downlink.
The EMF exposure level without considering the minimum distance between BSs and restricted
areas (i.e., the hole radius R= 0 m ) has been studied in [4], [12]. It can be observed from Fig. 2
that the regulation on the minimum distance between BSs and restricted areas greatly affects
the measurement of EMF exposure. Obviously, the exposure of the typical user outside the hole
is higher than the one inside the restricted area, as the distance between the BS and the typical
user in the restricted area is always larger than the hole radius R. Moreover, Fig. 2 illustrates
that a rise in the radius of the hole dramatically reduces the exposure for the user inside the
hole and still has a slight impact on the user outside the hole. This is because a larger value of
Rnot only leads to the longer propagation distance but slightly decreases the density of BSs in
(2), resulting in fewer BSs, namely, fewer radiating sources.
In Fig. 3, the coverage probability is depicted against the hole radius, for the same settings
considered in Fig. 2. We notice that the typical user outside the restricted areas experiences better19

coverage than the user inside. We can also observe the slight reduction in the coverage of the
users outside the restricted areas as we increase the hole radius (for similar reasons as explained
in our comments on Fig. 2). By comparing Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, it is noticed that the hole with a large
radius can protect people from serious EMF exposure while impairing communication quality. It
is also worth noting that at larger values of R, the gap between simulation and analytical results
is caused by the PHP approximation of the BS distribution.
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the impact of the density of the restricted areas/holes ( r) and the
baseline density of the BSs ( b) on the EMF exposure and coverage probability, respectively,
for the users outside the restricted areas. Since the holes ensure a lower exposure level in the
restricted areas than that outside the hole, the safety requirement of the user inside the hole
can be guaranteed as long as the EMF exposure of the user outside the hole is less than the
maximum allowable value ( Wmax= 10 W=m2, depicted as the dashed horizontal line) deﬁned
by the FCC [39]. We see that both the exposure and coverage probability decrease for higher
values ofr, while densely deployed BSs favorably affect coverage probability but adversely
affect EMF exposure in the downlink. The reason is that with the increasing BS density, the
serving BS may be closer to the typical user, and thus SNR would be improved. However, the
dense deployment of BSs would increase the radiating sources, making the typical user more
likely to be exposed to higher electromagnetic radiation level. In particular, the maximum density
(identiﬁed by the star shaped markers in Fig. 4) corresponds to the maximum allowable exposure.
This maximum density is analyzed in the following paragraph.20

value ofbmaximizes the downlink coverage probability is 7:610 4BSs=m2, forr=
10 6holes=m2andR= 200 m .
In Fig. 7, we plot the 95-th percentile of exposure level conditioned on the distance from the
typical user to its closest BS being at x0to calculate the compliance distance between users
and BSs. As mentioned in Sec. III-B4, compared with the FCC limits (depicted as the dashed
horizontal line), the minimum compliance distance between a BS and a user, xcom, can be found.
For the cellular network with b= 10 4BSs=m2andr= 10 6holes=m2,xcomis7:5 m, which
satisﬁesFWDLj7:5(10) = 0:95. Namely, the public safety cannot be ensured if they enter an area
centered at a BS with a radius of xcom.
B. Typical-Case Scenario for Downlink Exposure
The results in a more common case are given in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, where a statistical reduction
factor of 0:31is applied to the general downlink transmit power ( 100 W ), i.e.Pt= 100 W
0:31[27, Table 6], and the same path-loss exponent ( == 4) is used for evaluating the
network performance in the downlink. Fig. 8 suggests that the 95-th percentile of exposure level
in such a typical case is far below the FCC limit even in a network with the intensive deployment
of BSs. This observation supports the conception that the development of network densiﬁcation
will not trigger severe health problems. In Fig. 9, instead of giving the coverage probability, we21

plot the outage probability, the probability of an outage event when the SNR cannot meet the
required threshold, and we see that the simulation results closely match the analysis results.
C. Uplink Exposure
In the uplink, fractional power control at the UE is considered which makes the transmit
power a function of the distance to the associated BS. The maximum transmit power at the UE
is set to 200 mW (i.e., the maximum transmit power in 5G mobile equipment [27, Table 6]).
The distance between the user and its personal mobile equipment is assumed to be in far ﬁeld of
the UE antenna with u0= 20 cm .2Since the close distance between the user and its personal
mobile equipment, the path-loss exponent ( ) between them is typically smaller than that ( )
between the mobile equipment and its serving BS. Thus, we set = 4 and= 2:5. Besides,
lower noise power is considered since the frequency band in uplink is normally narrower than
that in downlink.
The impact of power control factor on the distribution of uplink EMF exposure and SNR
is presented in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 10 that increasing
the power control factor leads to more severe exposure in uplink. This is because the transmit
power of UE with the distance-proportional power control increases with , as shown in (23).
Similarly, in Fig. 11, the larger the power control factor, the higher power the serving BS receives,
2The far ﬁeld of the antenna is deﬁned as u >2D2
c=f, whereDis the diameter of the antenna and c=f is the wavelength
of the uplink frequency f. Considering the Long Term Evolution (LTE) using a frequency band of 2600 MHz ,D= 10 cm ,
andc=f= (3108m=s)=(2600 MHz) , we haveu>17:3 cm . Thus,u0= 20cm satisﬁes the far-ﬁeld condition of the UE’s
antenna [44].22

thereby enhancing the coverage performance. Intuitively, as we increase up to 1, the transmit
power can completely compensate the path loss in the BS-UE link and the received power will
equal topuif the distance between a BS and its serving user ( x0) is belowXmax(as described
in Sec. IV-A). However, if x0exceedsXmax, thenPUL
tranreaches its maximum value of 200 mW ,
which explains the small difference in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 when changing from 0:6to= 1.
In Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, we explore the effect of hole radius Ron the exposure level and the
coverage probability in the uplink. Different from simulation results on the downlink exposure
in Sec. VI-A, in Fig. 12, the user inside the hole is exposed to higher-level RFR emitted from
personal mobile equipment than the user outside the hole. Interestingly, we notice that increasing23

the zone radius Rdoes not mitigate RFR for both two kinds of users (inside and outside the
holes). The reason for this anomaly is that we control the transmit power at UE, which is
monotonically increasing with the distance between the user and its serving BS as in (23).
Particularly, for the user outside the hole, when we expand R, the density of PHP-distributed
BSs,B, will decrease. The reduced number of BSs has no effect on uplink radiating sources
since the uplink exposure is induced by an individual’s mobile device. However, the distance
between the closest BS to the typical user may become farther, resulting in stronger transmit
power at UE and exposure to the user. We also notice that the uplink exposure level of the
typical user inside the hole gradually tends to be constant when R > 150 m , which is the
consequence of maximum transmit power constraint. On the other hand, the uplink coverage
probability decreases as we increase the hole radius, as shown in Fig. 13. This trend is similar
to the downlink scenario observed in Fig. 3.
Next, we discuss the inﬂuence of bon the network performance metrics in Fig. 14 and
Fig. 15. Increasing the value of bleads to a decrease in the 95-th percentile of EMF exposure
(as shown in Fig. 14) and an increase in coverage probability (as shown in Fig. 15) for the
typical user inside and outside the restricted area. In fact, after increasing the baseline density
b, there are more BSs around the typical user, which has a potential to reduce the distance ( x0)
between the typical user and its serving BS. Meanwhile, the shorter distance x0leads to lower
transmit power in (23) and lower EMF exposure levels in (24). The improvement in coverage
probability and the mitigation in EMF exposure in uplink reveals that dense deployment of BSs24

is conducive to the future cellular network design.
D. Exposure Index (Joint Downlink&Uplink Exposure)
Generally, the SAR value of voice usage is larger than that of other usage, such as data down-
loading/uploading. Considering such a worst case, we choose SARUL= 0:0053 andSARDL=
0:0042 [44, Table 27].
Fig. 16 reveals the impact of hole radius on the joint downlink&uplink exposure. It can
be concluded from Fig. 2 and Fig. 12 that the existence of holes around the restricted areas
cannot mitigate the exposure from UE but it is effective for reducing the exposure from BSs.
The contradicting trend (between the increase in uplink exposure and the decrease in downlink
exposure when expanding the exclusion zone radius) reminds us that we cannot blindly protect
the users by removing BSs near the restricted areas, which also causes both uplink and downlink
coverage performance degradation as can be seen in Fig. 3 and Fig. 13. Therefore, Fig. 16
considers joint downlink and uplink exposure as EIwhen resizing the hole radius. In Fig. 16,
whenR< 100 m , the total exposure is mainly from the BSs in downlink but when R100 m ,
downlink exposure is gradually decreasing and uplink exposure becomes dominant. Namely,
there exists an optimal value, e.g., R= 100 m , that minimizes the total exposure for the
network with b= 10 4:5BSs=m2.
In Fig. 17, we plot the 95-th percentile of EIfor the typical user inside and outside the restricted
area under different baseline densities of BSs. The dense deployment of BSs can improve both
uplink and downlink coverage probability as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 15. Nevertheless, the uplink25
and downlink exposure levels show opposite trends with the increase of the baseline density b,
as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 14, respectively. These imply that there is an optimal value of b
that minimizes the EI, i.e., a solution to the optimization problem in (39). For the typical user
inside the hole, it can be observed from Fig. 17 that there is a turning point 
b= 10 4:5BSs=m2.
Before this point, EIis dominated by EIUL, and after it, EIis dominated by EIDL. At this point,
the joint exposure, EI, at the restricted area is minimized. For the typical user outside the hole,
the optimal baseline density, 
b, corresponding to the minimum EIis10 5BSs=m2.
VII. C ONCLUSION
This paper integrated the EMF restrictions on the coverage performance and exposure analysis
and formulated optimization problems on how to design the EMF-aware cellular networks.
Particularly, the distribution of BSs was generated by a PHP, accounting for the distance between
BSs and restricted areas where the presence of BSs is prohibited. Using tools of stochastic
geometry, we analyzed the radiation and coverage probability in terms of downlink and uplink.
Furthermore, we investigated the effect of system parameters on the joint downlink&uplink
radiation from both BSs and UE through EI. With the aid of numerical results, we showed that
even the conservative evaluation of the 95-th percentile of EMF exposure level can still comply
with the international guidelines, and the exposure in more typical settings is far below the
maximum permissible level. It can also be seen that increasing the baseline density of BSs or
decreasing the permitted distance around restricted areas can reduce the exposure from mobile
equipment in uplink while exacerbating the exposure from BSs in downlink. Such opposite
trend demonstrated the reasonability of taking joint downlink&uplink exposure into account
when designing the system parameters for the EMF-aware cellular network. We found that there
exists optimal values of the distance between restricted areas and BSs and the baseline density
of BSs that minimizes the total exposure under a certain network conﬁguration.
APPENDIX A
PROOF OF LEMMA 1
The PHP 	Bcan be approximated as a PPP with density B=bexp( rR2). Following
the standard result of PPP [48], the Lebesgue measure of the area centered at the typical user26
outside the hole can be expressed as out(x) =x2;x0. Using the null probability of PPP
in [49], the CDF of Xoutis given by
FXout(x) =PfXoutxg= 1 PfXout>xg= 1 exp [Bout(x)]
= 1 exp( Bx2) = 1 exp
 bexp( rR2)x2
:(40)
Because of the relationship between PDF and CDF, i.e., fXout(x) =d
dxFXout(x), we can obtain
the PDF of Xout,fXout(x), in (12a). For the typical user inside the hole, the Lebesgue measure
of the area is given by in(x) =(x2 R2);xR, whereRis the radius of the holes. Then,
using the same steps of deriving fXout(x), we ﬁnish the proof of fXin(x).
APPENDIX B
PROOF OF THEOREM 1
We start by analyzing the downlink coverage probability of the typical user outside the hole.
With the distribution of Xoutin (12a), (10) and (11) can be further processed as

covfor the typical user inside the hole is similar to the above
approach, which therefore is omitted here.
APPENDIX C

APPENDIX D
PROOF OF THEOREM 3
Under the condition that the serving BS is located at b0with distance x0to the typical user,
the power density received at the typical user is from the closest BS with a distance of x0and
from the rest of BSs with distances greater than x0to the typical user, which is given by
