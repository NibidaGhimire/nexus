Abstract. We giveaMorse-theoreticcharacterization ofsimpleclose dgeodesics
on Riemannian 2-spheres. On any Riemannian 2-sphere endowe d with a
generic metric, we show there exists a simple closed geodesi c with Morse in-
dex 1, 2 and 3. In particular, for an orientable Riemannian su rface we prove
strong Morse inequalities for the length functional applie d to the space of
simple closed curves.
1.Introduction
The celebrated theorem of Lusternik-Schnirelmann [ 21] is:
Theorem 1.1. A closed Riemannian 2-sphere(S2,g)admits at least three simple
closed geodesics.
Birkhoﬀ [ 9] initiated the construction of a closed geodesic by introducing the
min-max method to ﬁnd unstable geodesics, in case of where minimizat ion tech-
niques do not work. Later, Lusternik and Schnirelmann [ 21] produced three closed
geodesics by using higher parameter families of simple closed curves f rom the non-
trivial homology classes of the space of embedded curves. The exis tence of three
simple geodesics comes from the topology of the space of simple curv es, which can
be deformed into ( RP3\D3,∂). It was not clear that whether the geodesics are
embedded in Lusternik and Schnirelmann’s work. The proof was repa ired by Ball-
mann [6] and Grayson [ 17] later. In particular, Grayson [ 17] used curve shortening
ﬂow to prove the existence of simple closed geodesics. On the other hand, Pitts
[27] developed min-max method and produced stationary geodesic net works with
possible point singularities, but it does not give full regularity of critic al geodesics.
In higher dimension, for 3 ≤n+ 1≤7, Morse index bounds of minimal hy-
persurfaces Σnon closed manifolds Mn+1were obtained by Marques and Neves.
Marques and Neves [ 25] proved that the Morse index of minimal hypersurface is
bounded above by the number of parameters of families of cycles. T hey also settled
that generically there is a lower bound of Morse index by the number o f parame-
ters under the mulitplicity one assumption in [ 26]. By combining these with Zhou’s
Multiplicity One Theorem [ 34], for bumpy metrics, there are minimal hypersurfaces
with Morse index kfor eachk∈N. Recently, Marques, Montezuma and Neves [ 23]
proved the strong Morse inequalities for the area functional in cod imension 1.
A natural question is whether there is any Morse-theoretic chara cterization of
simple closed geodesics, while the Morse theory of closed immersed ge odesics has
been developed in many literature (For instance, see Chapter VII o f Morse [ 22]).
From Lustenik-Schnirelmann category theory, claiming that the nu mber of critical
point of a smooth real-valued function deﬁned on a manifold Mis bounded from
12 DONGYEONG KO
below by one plus the maximal cup-length of the cohomology ring of M, it is
expected that there are three simple closed geodesics with index 1 ,2,3 from each
parameter family on a bumpy sphere. Moreover, it has been known t hat there are
exactly three simple closed geodesics with Morse index 1 ,2 and 3 on ellipsoids in
Morse’s example (Theorem 2.1 of the Chapter IX of [ 22]).
However, to the author’s knowledge, the index estimate was unkno wn for simple
closed geodesics on generic 2-spheres. The main diﬃculty comes fro m the lack of
the weak convergence such as the Hilbert manifold structure of th e space of simple
closedcurves. Moreover,itisevendiﬃculttoconstructasmoothh omotopybetween
two smooth families of simple closed curves with a controlled length. Wh ile the
existence of such a homotopy without length bound is known by the w ork of Smale
[31], there was no such construction of homotopy with quantitative bo unds. Note
thatKetover,LiokumovichandSong[ 19]constructedthesmoothinterpolationwith
controlled area between two surfaces which are close to a union of s trictly stable
minimal surfaces.
In this paper, we conﬁrm the heuristic above by deriving Morse index bound of
simple closed geodesics of generic 2-spheres and strong Morse ineq ualities of closed
geodesics without self-intersection for length functional. In part icular, we realize
the geodesics with Morse index 1 ,2,3 on generic Riemannian 2-spheres in Theorem
1.2 below.
A Riemannian metric gis calledbumpyif every closed geodesic is nondegenerate
i.e. there is no closed geodesic that admits a non-trivial Jacobi ﬁeld. The bumpy
condition gives Morse property to the length functional. Abraham s howed that
bumpy metrics are generic in the Cr-Baire sense in Abraham [ 1] forr≥5.
Theorem 1.2. For a2-sphere with a bumpy metric (S2,g), for each k= 1,2,3,
there exists a closed and embedded geodesic γkwith
(1) index(γk) =k
and the lengths γ1,γ2andγ3satisfy
|γ1|<|γ2|<|γ3|.
Remark 1.3. A triaxial ellipsoid whose lengths of three axes are slightl y distinct
has only three simple closed geodesics with Morse index 1,2and3(Theorem 2.1 of
the Chapter IX in Morse [22]).
For general 2-spheres, we have a following Morse-theoretic char acterization as a
direct corollary of Theorem 1.2:
Corollary 1.4. On a Riemannian 2-sphere(S2,g), for each k= 1,2,3, there exists
a closed and embedded geodesic γkwith
index(γk)≤k≤index(γk)+nullity(γk).
Remark 1.5. After this paper was completed, Stephan Suhr brought to the a uthor’s
attention that Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.4 may be obtained from combining
Theorem 1.3(iii) in De Philippis-Marini-Mazzucchelli-Su hr[14]and the classical
arguments on inﬁnite-dimensional Morse theory, as discuss ed in[10](See also [22],
[5]and[7]).
We generalize the Morse index bound (1) by obtaining Morse inequalitie s for
length functional for all simple closed geodesics on orientable surfa ces (M2,g) en-
dowed with bumpy metric, even for those which do not realize the widt h of threeMORSE INDEX BOUND AND MORSE INEQUALITIES 3
nontrivialhomologiesofthe space ofcurves. We alsonotethat the exampleofCold-
ing and Hingston [ 12] that contains simple closed geodesics with arbitrary Morse
Index on orientable surfaces.
We deﬁne bk(a,Π) as the k-th Betti number of the space of simple closed curves
whose length is less than awith coeﬃcients in Z2for a ﬁxed homotopy class Π
of curves, and ck(a,Π) as the number of simple closed geodesics on ( M2,g) with
length less than awithin Π. Also let us count point curves as one geodesic with
zero length and index 0.
Theorem 1.6. For each a∈(0,∞),bk(a,Π)<∞for every k∈Z+and the Strong
Morse inequality for simple closed geodesics in a ﬁxed homot opy class Πhold:
cr(a,Π)−cr−1(a,Π)+...+(−1)rc0(a,Π)≥br(a,Π)−br−1(a,Π)+...+(−1)rb0(a,Π)
for every r∈Z+. In particular,
cr(a,Π)≥br(a,Π)
for every r∈Z+.
By compactness theorem, we are able to deduce that the number o fsimple closed
geodesics with bounded length is ﬁnite and so we can sum up all terms a nd we have
the following:
Corollary 1.7. For each a∈(0,∞),bk(a)<∞for every k∈Z+and the Strong
Morse inequality for simple closed geodesics hold:
cr(a)−cr−1(a)+...+(−1)rc0(a)≥br(a)−br−1(a)+...+(−1)rb0(a)
for every r∈Z+. In particular,
cr(a)≥br(a)
for every r∈Z+.
The novel idea of our proof is to construct a smooth interpolation b etween two
families of curves near a ﬁxed geodesic γsatisfying a length constraint. More
speciﬁcally, for small ǫ >0 if Φ : X→ Sis a continuous map in the smooth
topology such that
sup{F(Φ(x),γ) :x∈X}< ǫ,
then we can construct a homotopy H: [0,1]×X→ Sbetween Φ( x) andγsuch
that the following F-distance estimate holds along H:
(2) sup {F(H(t,x),γ) :x∈Xandt∈[0,1]}< C(|γ|)√ǫ,
whereSis a space of simple closed curves on ( S2,g) and for some C(|γ|)>0. By
deforming Hwith a local min-max deformation originated from White [ 33] and
taking a pushforward homotopy, we prove the interpolation lemma ( Lemma 6.4)
which is a smooth analog of Theorem 3.8 in [ 26]. This follows the length bound
along the homotopy which do not exceed the widths in the proof of Th eorem 1.2.
Ourconstructionofthehomotopy Hin(2)comesfromtheanalysisofhomotopies
in the squeezing lemma (Lemma 5.4). For small handǫ, one obtains the upper
bound of F-distance between a simple closed curve αlying on Nh(γ) whose length
is bounded by |α|<|γ|+ǫand a strictly stable geodesic γwith a negative Gaussian
curvature on γ. We see this by obtaining the bound of total angle/integraltext
α|θ|in terms
ofhandǫinspired by the proof of Quantitative Constancy Theorem in Song an d4 DONGYEONG KO
Zhou [32]. This gives rise to the idea to control the F-distance with γalong the
homotopy even if curves are not graphical.
Since the map constructed in Lemma 5.4 comes out from the curve sh ortening
ﬂow and the squeezing map in this case, the curves along the homoto py satisfy
the length bound and stay in the tubular neighborhood by the existe nce of a mean
convex foliation by level curves of the geodesic. This gives the F-distance bound
along the homotopy. For the general geodesic case, one can obta in the upper bound
ofF-distance by considering appropriate deformation to change the g eodesic to be
strictly stable and with negative ambient curvaturecase as in the st rictly stable and
with negative ambient curvature case in the tubular neighborhood w hich preserves
the order of the F-distance bound along the homotopy.
We adoptsmoothmin-maxconstructionofgeodesicsasin Grayson’s work[15]on
curve shortening ﬂow and develop Morse-theoretic characteriza tionof simple closed
geodesicsarisingfrom smooth sweepouts with min-max techniques ( See Colding-De
Lellis [11] and Haslhofer-Ketover [ 18] for 3-dimensional manifolds). We prove the
Morse index bound by relying on the analysis of local min-max structu re near the
geodesic with given Morse index of White [ 33], deformation techniques in Marques
and Neves’ work on Morse theory for area functional in [ 25] and [26] and the inter-
polation lemma we explained above. Moreover, for the proof of Mors e inequalities,
we mostly follow the schemes of Marques, Montezuma and Neves [ 23] and we apply
the interpolation lemmas (Lemma 6.3 and Lemma 6.4) in place of the inter polation
lemma in the ﬂat topology (Theorem 3.8 in [ 23]).
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduc e the
smooth min-max construction of geodesics and prove the pull-tight properties. In
Section 3, we prove that the relation between F-distance and Hausdorﬀ distance.
In Section 4, we show the 1-varifoldversion of local min-max theore m. In Section 5,
we describe the perturbation of the metric and prove squeezing lem ma on a family
of curves. In Section 6, we prove F-distance estimate along the squeezing map and
the interpolation lemma. In Section 7, we prove Theorem 1.2. In Sect ion 8, we
obtain strong Morse inequalities for simple closed geodesics for lengt h functional.

2.Smooth Min-max Construction
We introduce the smooth min-max setting and generate simple closed geodesics.
We will construct the deformation to prove Theorem 1.2 in Section 7 b ased on
the tightened sequence in Theorem 2.3. The following contents are s mooth min-
max constructions of simple closed geodesics (see [ 11] and [18] for minimal surface
version) in myriad of classical literature (e.g. [ 17] and [21]).MORSE INDEX BOUND AND MORSE INEQUALITIES 5
FirstletV1(S2)beaspaceofvarifoldsand IV1(S2)be aspaceofintegralvarifolds
on (S2,g) and endow an F-metric on the space of varifolds.
We recall the following deﬁnition of varifold F-distance F:V1(S2)×V1(S2)→R
in the space of varifolds on ( S2,g) from [28].
(3)F(V,W) = sup{V(f)−W(f) :f∈Cc(G1(S2)),where|f| ≤1,Lip(f)≤1},
whereG1(S2) is a Grassmannian on the sphere ( S2,g) and the metric on the Grass-
mannian bundle G1(S2) is deﬁned by the induced metric by g.
We deﬁne the space of smooth embedded closed (unparametrized) curvesXon
(S2,g) as following:
X:={F(S1)|F:S1→S2is a smooth embedding }.
Also we deﬁne the space of boundary point curves as X0. Lusternik-Schnirelmann
theory (Appendix A.3 of [ 20]) shows that the space of embedded circles retracts
onto the space of geodesic circles of sphere, so we have ( X ∪X 0,X0) retracts onto
(RP3\D3,∂), where D3is a open 3-ball. Let us endow smooth topology in Σ :=
X ∪X 0and identify boundary point curves in X0. Then since Σ is homeomorphic
toRP3\D3,S:= Σ/∂Σ is homeomorphic to RP3.
From the topological structure of Sabove, it has the following three nontrivial
Z2-homology classes {hi}i=1,2,3(cf. Section 2 of [ 18]) :
hi:=Hi(S,Z2) =Z2.
Now we deﬁne sweepouts more precisely. Let αbe a generator of the ﬁrst co-
homology ring H1(S,Z2). We consider the cohomology ring, which is given by
H∗(S,Z2) =Z[α]/α4. For each i, denote Xto be an i-dimensional simplicial
complex. We say that Φ : X→ Sdetectsω∈Hi(S,Z2) if
Φ∗(ω)/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Then we let Φ be an i-sweepout with an endowedsmooth topologyif it detects i-cup
productαi. Now let Sibe the set of all i-sweepouts which detect αifori∈ {1,2,3}.
We deﬁne the widthofi-parameter sweepouts as
ωi(S2) := inf
Φ∈Sisup
x∈X|Φ(x)|=Li,
fori∈ {1,2,3}. By deﬁnition of i-sweepouts, we have ω1(S2)≤ω2(S2)≤ω3(S2).
Let us denote the sequence of i-sweepout family of curves {Φj(x)}as aminimiz-
ing sequence if limj→∞supx∈X|Φj(x)|=Li. If|Φj(xj)|converges to Lifor some
sequence of parameters {xj}wherexj∈Xand{Φj(x)}is a minimizing sequence,
then let us call Φ j(xj) as amin-max sequence . Also let the critical set Λ({Φj})
be a set of stationary varifolds can be obtained by the limit of min-max sequence
induced by {Φj(x)}.
Let the set of critial geodesic WLibe a set of stationary varifolds whose support
is a simple closed geodesic and length is Li. Moreover, We denote WLi,jandWj
Li
by the elements in WLiwhose support has Morse index less than or equal to jor
larger than or equal to j, respectively.
By curve shortening ﬂow argument in [ 17], we have the following version of
pull-tight type theorem (cf. Lemma 8.1 of [ 17]).
Theorem 2.1. Suppose (S2,g)is endowed with a smooth metric. For any mini-
mizing sequence {Φj}ofi-sweepouts, there is a deformed minimizing sequence {ˆΦj}6 DONGYEONG KO
of{Φj}satisfying the following property. For any s >0, there is some 0< a < L i
satisfying
(4) {ˆΦj(x)∈IV1(S2) :|ˆΦj(x)| ≥Li−a} ⊂/uniondisplay
γ∈Λ({Φj})∩WLiBF
s(γ)
for all suﬃciently large j, whereBF
s(γ)is aF-metric ball with center γ. Moreover,
the multiplicity of geodesics in the critical set is 1.
Proof.By the compactness theorem of simple closed geodesics (Theorem A .1), for
V∈V1(S2),F(V,WLi) is well-deﬁned.
Given a simple closed curve α, denote H(t,α) as a curve deformed by curve
shortening ﬂow at time t. Note that H(t,α) is an embedded curve for any t≥0.
We setˆΦj(x) :=H(tj,Φj(x)) forx∈Xwhere{tj}is a sequence such that tj→ ∞
asj→ ∞.
We argue by contradiction and assume that there is a sequence of v arifolds
{ˆΦjk(xjk)}k∈Nsuchthat |ˆΦjk(xjk)| ≥Li−akandF(ˆΦjk(xjk),WLi)≥sandak→0,
jk→ ∞ask→ ∞. After passing to a subsequence, lim k→∞|ˆΦjk(xjk)|=Liand
limk→∞F(ˆΦjk(xjk),WLi)≥s. However, as time tjkgoes to inﬁnity, ˆΦjk(xjk) =
H(tjk,Φjk(xjk)) converges to geodesics in WLior simple closed geodesics whose
length is smaller than Li. This contradicts to our assumption.
Since curves converge to a multiplicity one geodesic or a single point by the
curve shortening ﬂow at limit time, the multiplicity of geodesics in the cr itical set
is 1. /square
By the proceeding pull-tight argument with curve shortening ﬂow, w e can con-
struct simple closed geodesics for each i-sweepout. Let us consider spheres with
bumpy metric. From the bumpiness of the metric ( S2,g) and Corollary 8.3 of [ 17]
(from Lusternik-Schnirelmann’s topological argument), we obtain the existence of
three simple closed geodesics with distinct lengths as following.
Corollary 2.2. There are at least three simple closed geodesics on the bumpy sphere
(S2,g)with length L1,L2andL3.
Proof.Assume that two critical lengths from diﬀerent sweepouts are the same.
Corollary 8.3 of [ 17] asserts that there are inﬁnitely many simple closed geodesics
if two critical length are the same. But it does not happen in the bump y sphere
(S2,g) by Corollary A.2. Hence, the lengths of three simple closed geodesic s are
distinct each other. The pull-tight argument of Theorem 2.1 by ﬂow g ives three
simple closed geodesics with length L1,L2andL3. /square
Next we prove pull-tight type theorem to avoid the geodesics with lar ge index in
the sweepout. We need this theorem to prove the lower index bound in the proof
of Theorem 1.2. This theorem is an analog of Theorem 4.9 of [ 26] and is deduced
by the constructive proof of Deformation theorem A of [ 25]. We use the notation
in Theorem 5.1 of [ 25] in our proof.
Note that Deformation Theorem A in [ 25] can be applied to sweepouts with
smooth topology (See Remark 1.3 of [ 25]). To be more precise, all deformations
in the theorem are isotopies, and we can get smooth deformations b y mollifying
continuous deformations.MORSE INDEX BOUND AND MORSE INEQUALITIES 7
Theorem 2.3. Suppose (S2,g)is a2-sphere with a bumpy metric. For any min-
imizing sequence {Φj}which is an i-sweepout, there is a deformed minimizing se-
quence{ˆΦj}of{Φj}satisfying the following property. For any small s >0, there
is some0< a < L isatisfying

Proof.By applying Theorem 2.1 and for minimizing sequence {Φj}, there is a

Let 0< s < ǫ whereǫis a constant from Deformation Theorem A of [ 25]. We
deform{Ψj}to{ˆΦj}by the deformation of Deformation Theorem A. Notice that
|Ψj(x)|< Li−a′ifx∈X\Ui,2ǫby the above and s <2ǫ. We divide into three
cases and show that the curve with length close to Liis not in the neighborhood
of simple closed geodesics with large index.
Ifx∈X\Ui,2ǫ, thenˆΦi(x) = Ψi(x) andF(γ,ˆΦi(x))> ǫ > swhereIndex(γ)≥

Ifx∈Ui,2ǫ\Ui,5ǫ/4, we know that

and
(7) lim
i→∞sup
x∈X||Ψi(x)|−|(FHi(x,1))♯(Ψi(x))||= 0
whereHi(x,t) is a perturbation homotopy of Deformation Theorem A. Then (6)
and (7) imply that
|ˆΦi(x)|< Li−a′

for large i.
We consider the last case of x∈Ui,5ǫ/4. By the deformation we obtain the
following bound of the length:
|ˆΦi(x)| ≤Li−c0
20.
Now we take a= min(a′

20) and we obtain our claim by combining all cases.
Multiplicity one propertyis not changedby ourdeformation sothat t he multiplicity
of geodesics in critical set is also 1. /square
3.F-distance and Hausdorff distance of 1-dimensional integra l
varifolds
In this section, we introduce a useful lemma to deal with 1-dimension al integral
varifolds induced by simple closed curves. We prove that if two integr al varifolds
induced by simple closed curves are suﬃciently close in F-metric, then two varifolds
are close in Hausdorﬀ distance sense.8 DONGYEONG KO
We show the following lemma by obtaining the bound of Hausdorﬀ measu re
of the part of one varifold lying on the outside of small tubular neighb orhood of
another varifold. Since the support of each varifold is connected, every point on one
varifold cannot go very far from another varifold by this estimate. This argument
is only valid for 1-dimensional varifolds. Let us denote Hausdorﬀ dist ance between
two nonempty subsets AandBof (S2,g) as
dH(A,B) = max/braceleftBig
sup
a∈Ad(a,B),sup
b∈Bd(b,A)/bracerightBig
,
whered(a,B) = inf b∈Bd(a,b) andd(a,b) is an (intrinsic) distance between two
points on ( S2,g).
Lemma 3.1. LetV,W∈IV1(S2)be integral varifolds induced by simple closed
curves. For h >0, ifF-distance between two varifolds VandWsatisﬁes
(8) F(V,W)< h2/10,
then
dH(supp(V),supp(W))< h.
Proof.Let us deﬁne the function f:G1(S2)→Ras
f(x,π) = max( d(x,supp(W)),1),
whereπ∈TxS2. Note that fsatisﬁesf≥0,|f| ≤1 andLip(f)≤1 so it satisﬁes
theconditionoftestfunction for F-distance, and f(x,π) = 0atx∈supp(W). Also,
it suﬃces to consider the case of |V/rightanglesw(S2\Nh
2(supp(W)))| /\e}atio\slash= 0. Now we obtain

4.Local Min-max Families
In this section, we prove the 1-varifold version of the local min-max theorem in
[26], where the original version is Theorem 5 of [ 33]. While the proof is the simpler
version of the proof of Theorem 6.1 of [ 26], we include the argument for the sake of
completeness. Here we denote Bkas an open unit ball in Rk.
Theorem 4.1. Letγbe asimple closed geodesic with Morse index kand multiplicity
one. For every β >0, there is ǫ >0and a smooth family {Fv}v∈¯Bk⊂Diff(S2)
such that
(i)F0=Id, F−v=F−1
vfor allv∈¯Bk;
(ii) the function
Lγ:¯Bk→[0,∞), Lγ(v) =|(Fv)♯γ|,
is strictly concave;
(iii)||Fv−Id||C1< βfor allv∈¯Bk;
and suchthat for every V∈IV1(S2)induced by a simple closed curve with F(V,γ)<
ǫ, we have
max
v∈¯Bk|(Fv)♯V| ≥ |γ|
with equality only if γ= (Fv)♯Vfor some v∈¯Bk.
Proof.In this proof, we adopt notations in [ 26]. We deﬁne a smooth family
{Fv}v∈¯Bk⊂Diff(S2) with properties satisfying (i) and (ii) constructed by the
ﬁrstklinear combination of normal eigensections {Xi=d
dtFtei|t=0}1≤i≤kof the
stability operator of γon (S2,g) which are L2-orthonormal each other. Let us

neighborhood Bδ(0)⊂¯Bkof the origin since PV(0) = 0 and DPV(0) =Id, and
our family satisﬁes (iii) by taking small δ >0. Now let us consider the functional

,
whereλ1is the ﬁrst eigenvalue of the stability operator of γ. Thenγis a strictly
stable point of L∗. From Theorem 5 in [ 33] we obtain a tubular neighborhood
Nh(γ) such that γis a strict minimizer of L∗inNh(γ). By setting ǫ=h2/10 and
applying Lemma 3.1, we have γas a strict minimizer of the functional L∗among
varifolds induced by simple closed curves satisfying F(V,γ)< ǫ.
We can choose δ′such that F((Fv)♯γ,γ)< ǫ/2 for every v∈Bk
δ′and argue
by contradiction. Take {Fv}Bk
δ′as a local min-max family and suppose there is
a sequence of varifolds {Vj}induced by curves converging to γin theF-metric

5.Squeezing a Family of Curves
Inthissection, weproveatopologicalsqueezinglemmatoensureth econtractibil-
ity of a family of curves near a ﬁxed simple closed geodesic. More prec isely, this
lemma asserts that the ﬁnite parameter family of simple closed curve s within a
small neighborhood of a simple closed geodesic can be squeezed into t he simple
closed geodesic. Hence, the family is nullhomotopic endowed with smoo th topol-
ogy and F-metric. The lemma is a varifold F-metric analog in smooth topology
of Theorem 8.2 of [ 4] and Proposition 3.5 of [ 24], the homotopy lemma with ﬂat
topology. We apply curve shortening ﬂow to squeeze a family of curv es within a
small neighborhood of a geodesic with smooth topology instead of ad opting the
construction of the homotopy from the work of Almgren [ 4].
We construct the case of γis strictly stable with ambient negative Gaussian cur-
vature ﬁrst, and deal with general geodesics by metric perturba tion. For the family
near the strictly stable simple closed geodesic with ambient negative c urvature, we
ﬂowthe curveswithin the tubular neighborhoodwhich canbe foliated by meancon-
vex curves to make all curves graphical. Then we apply a squeezing m ap of graphs
to squeeze all curves in the family to the single geodesic. For the gen eral case, we
slightly perturb the metric near the geodesic to make it strictly stab le with ambient
negative curvature, and take a pullback homotopy in the smaller neig hborhood.
Note that the squeezing lemma also yields the contractibility of ﬁnite p arameter
family of simple closed curves which are homologous to the center circ le in any
cylinder. Eventhoughwe constructthe explicit homotopyviacurve shorteningﬂow
in the small tubular neighborhood of geodesic, there is a diﬀeomorph ism between
any topological cylinder and the small tubular neighborhood so that we can extend
this topological result to any cylinder. This fact also follows from Sma le’s theorem
on diﬀeomorphism group of 2-sphere [ 31].
5.1.Homotopy type of the curve near the geodesic in the tubular ne igh-
borhood. Suppose we have a simple closed curve suﬃciently close to simple closed
geodesic γinF-distance sense. We prove the proposition that the curve is homol-
ogous to γin the small tubular neighborhood Nh(γ) ofγ. We rule out the case of
the nullhomotopic curve in the small tubular neighborhood to avoid th e case of the
curve converges to a single point by the curve shortening ﬂow.
From now on, we adopt Fermi coordinates c: [0,L]×(−h,h)→S2onNh(γ)
on the tubular neighborhood Nh(γ) of the ﬁxed geodesic γas in Appendix of [ 15].
The metric on the tubular neighborhood of γis
(12) ds2=J(x,y)2dx2+dy2
such that
(1)Jyy=−KJ
(2)J(x,0) = 1
(3)Jx(x,0) =κ= 0MORSE INDEX BOUND AND MORSE INEQUALITIES 11
(4)Jy(x,0) = 0
whereKis a Gaussian curvature and κis a geodesic curvature of γ.
Proposition 5.1. Ifαis an integral varifold induced by a simple closed curve and
F(α,γ)< h2/10, thenαis homologous to γin a small tubular neighborhood Nh(γ)
ofγ.
Proof.Let us assume that αis not homologous to γi.e. the curve is nullhomotopic
inNh(γ) and show this lemma by contradiction. Note that the Hausdorﬀ dist ance
between two curves satisﬁes dH(α,γ)< hsinceF(α,γ)< h2/10 by Lemma 3.1.
Let the length of γbeL. Throughout this proof we endow Fermi coordinate
c: [0,L]×(−h,h)→S2onNh(γ), where the metric on the tubular neighborhood
is given as (12). We lift this Fermi coordinate to the universal cover of the cylinder
R×(−h,h)and consider the lifted coordinate C:R×(−h,h)→S2, whereπ◦C=c
and the lifted metric is given by d˜s2=J2d˜x2+dy2. Then we deﬁne the horizontal
widthWσof a closed curve σinNhas the maximum diﬀerence of ˜ x-coordinate on
the lift:
Wσ:= sup
p1,p2∈˜σ|˜x(p1)−˜x(p2)|,
whereC(˜x(z),y(z)) :=zfor every z∈σ. We point out that the lift ˜ αofαis a
closed curve since αis nullhomotopic.
We show that the horizontal width of αis less than3L
4. Suppose p1andp2are
two points on ˜ αrealizing the horizontal width of αand these two points divide ˜ α
into two pieces. Let the lengths be l1andl2. Let us deﬁne las a distance between
p1andp2. Then we have a following estimate:
l≤l1+l2
2=|α|
2<L+F(α,γ)
2=L+δ
2<L+h2
2.
For the second inequality, we used F(V,W)≥ ||V| − |W||for varifolds VandW
by (3). Then by the triangle inequality, we have
Wα=|x(p1)−x(p2)| ≤d(C(p1,0),p1)+d(p1,p2)+d(p2,C(p2,0))
≤h+L+h2
2+h
<3L
4(13)
(13) comes from h≪L. Since the horizontal width WαofαsatisﬁesWα<3L
4,
there is a strip π(C([a,a+L]×(−h,h)))⊂Nh(γ) which does not contain any point
ofα. Hence there exists a point x∈γsuch that α∩Bh(x) =∅so thatdH(α,γ)≥h
and it contradicts F(α,γ)< h2/10 of Lemma 3.1. /square
5.2.Perturbation of the metric. In this subsection, we conformally deform the
metric to make a geodesic to a strictly stable one with negative ambien t Gaussian
curvature. From this perturbation, we can construct the homot opy to deal with
the geodesic by applying the pullback homotopy from the map will be co nstructed
in the next subsection for the strictly stable and negative ambient c urvature case.
Now we perturb the metric near Nh(γ) to convert γto a strictly stable geodesic
with negative ambient Gaussian curvature. Let M >maxK(S2,g)and letνbe a
unit normal vector ﬁeld on γ, and for later estimates, let us take small hsatisfying
(14) h <max(M−1,1/10).12 DONGYEONG KO
Proposition 5.2. Given a simple closed geodesic γ, for any β >0, there exists a
smooth bump function φβ:S2→Rsuch that
(i)φβ(x) = 0whenx /∈Nh(γ)
(ii)φβ(x)<0forx∈γ
(iii)||exp(2φβ)−1||C0< β
(iv)∇˙γφβ= 0onγ[φβis constant on γ]
(v) The Hessian ∂2φβ(ν,ν) =Monγ.
Proof.Deﬁneφ:S2→Rin terms of its Fermi coordinate c: [0,L]×(−h,h)→S2
onNh(γ) in (12) as
(15) φ(c(x,y)) =−Ae−B/(h2−y2)
forx∈[0,L] andy∈(−h,h), and put φ(z) = 0 ifz /∈Nh(γ). This guarantees (i),
(ii) and (iv). Note that φis smooth on S2. We can calculate ∂2φ(ν,ν) onγas
∂2φ(ν,ν)|z=φ(c(x,0))=∂2φ(c(x,0))/∂y2= 2ABh−4e−B/h2=−2Bh−4φ(c(x,0)).
For anyǫ >0, let us take large Bby
(16) B=h4ǫ−1M,
andtake A=ǫeB/h2/2sothat φ(c(x,0)) =−ǫ/2. Thenwesetthat ∂2φ(c(x,0))(ν,ν) =
Mand||φ||C0< ǫ. Thus for any β >0 we can construct a bump function φβto
satisfy||exp(2φβ)−1||C0< βby taking appropriate ǫand corresponding AandB
in (15). This veriﬁes (iii) and (v) by our choice of AandB. /square
For a ﬁxed β >0, we have φβby Proposition 5.2 and the metric gβ= exp(2φβ)g
in Fermi coordinate is
(17) ds2
β=J(x,y)2exp(2φβ)dx2+exp(2φβ)dy2
and wehavea canonicaldiﬀeomorphism Gβ: (S2,g)→(S2,gβ) given by Gβ(z)≡z
for allz∈S2. Letγgβ:=Gβ(γ) andNh,gβ(γgβ) :=Gβ(Nh(γgβ)) in (S2,gβ).
Lemma 5.3. For any β >0,γgβis a strictly stable geodesic in Nh,gβ(γgβ). More-
over, the Gaussian curvature satisﬁes Kgβ(x)<0forx∈γgβon(S2,gβ).
Proof.By the calculation of the change of second fundamental form by co nformal
deformation in Besse [ 8], we obtain the geodesic curvature as

where∂φ/∂νis a normal derivative of φtoγwith respect to the metric gβso that
the geodesic curvature on γgβbecomes 0 and so γgβis a geodesic.
We prove that the Gaussian curvature of ( S2,gβ) onγgβis negative and γgβis
a stable geodesic in Nh,gβ(γgβ).

5.3.Squeezing lemma. Now we prove the following squeezing lemma by con-
structing the homotopy between family of curves. Our construct ion mainly relies
on the curve shortening ﬂow and the squeezing map in the sense of F ermi coor-
dinate. Our explicit construction of the squeezing map will be used to settle the
quantitative interpolation lemmas in Section 6.
For a strictly stable simple closed geodesic γwith negative ambient Gaussian
curvature, some tubular neighborhood Nh(γ) ofγcan be foliated by simple closed
curves{∂Nt(γ)}t∈[0,h]whose curvature vector points toward γ. To see this, we
adopt the Fermi coordinate c: [0,L]×(−h,h)→S2onNh(γ) in (12) and follow
the calculation in Appendix of [ 15]. Denote the orthonormal frame ﬁeld in Nh(γ)
bye1= (1/J)c∗(∂/∂x) ande2=c∗(∂/∂y), and deﬁne
(20) γt:=c({y=t})
as a level curve for t∈[−h,h]. Then (A.1) in [ 15] gives that the geodesic curvature
κt(x) (the positive direction is e2) of the curve γtatc(x,t)∈γt⊂S2to be:
κt(x) =−Jy(x,t)/J(x,t).
From the conditions (1),(2),(4) for (12), we have Jy(x,t)/t >0 for 0<|t|<
h′for anyx∈[0,L] and small h′>0. This gives the mean convex foliation
{∂Nt(γ)}t∈[0,h′]ofγ(See Proposition 5.7 of [ 25] for higher dimensional case with
the ﬁrst eigenfunction of Jacobi operator). Let us replace h′byhand call Nh(γ)
as amean convex neighborhood .
Lemma 5.4. Let(S2,g)be a sphere with bumpy metric, γbe a simple closed
geodesic, and Xbe a simplicial complex with ﬁnite dimension k. There exists
δ0=δ0((S2,g),γ)>0with the following property:
For0< δ < δ 0, ifΦ :X→ Sis a continuous map in the smooth topology such
that
sup{F(Φ(x),γ) :x∈X}< δ,
then there is a homotopy H: [0,1]×X→ Ssuch that H(0,x) = Φ(x)andH(1,x) =
γso thatΦis nullhomotopic.
Remark 5.5. The contractiblity of a ﬁnite dimensional family of simple c losed
curves in a topological cylinder also follows from Smale’s t heorem on diﬀeomorphism
group of Riemannian 2-spheres [31].
Remark 5.6. We can construct the squeezing map in the strictly stable cas e without
the ambient curvature condition directly rather than takin g a pullback homotopy
since there exists a mean convex foliation on the tubular nei gborhood of the geodesic.
Note that the curves in this foliation are not necessarily to be the level curves in
(20). We need to distinguish these two possible foliations t o obtain the quantitative
F-distance in Section 6 with the technical reason. Hence, we d ivide the cases to
the strictly stable geodesic with negative ambient curvatu re cases and the general
geodesic cases in the proof of Lemma 5.4.
Proof.First we prove the lemma when γis a strictly stable geodesic and whose
ambient negative Gaussian curvature is negative. We are able to sup pose the only
simple closed geodesic is in the tubular neighborhood Nh(γ) ofγsince the metric
is bumpy.
Forhsuch that Nh(γ) is a mean convex neighborhood, we set δ0=h2/10. Then
the entire support of Φ( x) are inNh(γ) by Lemma 3.1 for any x∈X. We apply the14 DONGYEONG KO
curve shortening ﬂow to the curve Φ( x) for each x. Note that the curve shortening
ﬂow deforms the family of curves continuously and each curve conv erges to a single
point or a simple closed geodesic as time goes to inﬁnity (See Propositio n 1.4 and
Theorem 3.1 of [ 15]).
Since Φ( x) is homologous with γinNh(γ) by Proposition 5.1 and Nh(γ) is a
mean convex neighborhood, each Φ( x) uniformly C∞-converges to γas time goes
to inﬁnity by the avoidance principle of the curve shortening ﬂow.
LetY(·,t)|Φ(x)bethecurveshorteningﬂowforΦ( x)whereY(·,0)|Φ(x)=supp(Φ(x))
andYt(y,t)|Φ(x)=κNwhereκis a geodesic curvature and Nis a normal vector
ﬁeld on Φ( x). Then for any small s >0 there is a large time t0such that for t > t0
and any x∈X, the total curvature/integraltext
Y(·,t)|κ|< ssince curves uniformly converge
toγ. We construct the homotopy H1: [0,1]×X→IV1(S2) induced by the ﬂow as
H1(t,x) =Y(·,2t0t)|Φ(x),
for allx∈Xand 0≤t≤1. We can take t0to make each curve H1(t,x) to be
graphical in Nh(γ) by taking suﬃciently small s >0 and applying Lemma A.2 of
[15].
We construct a second homotopy between curves H1(1,x) andγby using the
squeezing map (For similar constructions, see [ 19] and [25]). Let c: [0,L]×
(−h,h)→(S2,g) be the Fermi coordinate system. Since each curve H1(1,x) is
graphical, we can parametrize each curve H1(1,x) asH1(1,x) ={c(y,g(x,y))|y∈
[0,L]}, whereg:X×[0,L]→[−h,h] is a parametrization of the height function
part in Fermi coordinate of (12). We construct the second homot opy by
H2(t,x) ={c(y,(1−t)g(x,y))|y∈[0,L]}
for 0≤t≤1 andH2(1,x) =γfor every x∈X. By combining two homotopies H1
andH2by
(21) H=H1·H2,
we prove that Φ is nullhomotopic if γis a strictly stable geodesic whose ambient
Gaussian curvature is negative.
Now we consider a general geodesic γ. Let us ﬁx some β >0 and consider
the perturbed metric ( S2,gβ) as in (17) and corresponding diﬀeomorphism Gβ.
Thenγgβis a strictly stable geodesic and there exists a tubular neighborhood
Nh′(γgβ) which is a mean convex neighborhood of γgβ. Note that the tubular
neighborhood Nh′(γgβ) here should be taken as smaller one than Nh,gβ(γgβ). Let
us takeδ0=h′2/20. Then we have

6.Quantitative estimate of F-distance and the interpolation lemma
In this section, we prove the interpolation lemma (Lemma 6.4) betwee n two
families of simple closed curves which are close each other based on th e homotopy
weconstructedinSection5. Weconstructanexplicitinterpolationh omotopywhose
lengths do not exceed the critical length along the homotopy by com posing local
min-max diﬀeomorphism from Theorem 4.1 and squeezing map in Lemma 5 .4.
We proved the contractibility of a ﬁnite-parameter family of simple clo sed curves
which are homotopic to the center circle in any cylinder in Lemma 5.4. He nce we
know that two family of simple closed curves which are homologous to t he geodesic
in the small tubular neighborhood of the geodesic are homotopic. Ho wever, it
does not directly give the information on the length or F-distance bound along the
homotopy even in the small tubular neighborhood.16 DONGYEONG KO
6.1.F-distance estimate. In this subsection, we prove the quantitative estimate
ofF-distance along the squeezing map inspired by Lemma 5.4. First we sho w the
quantitative estimate of F-distance between a ﬁxed strictly stable geodesic and a
homologous simple closed curve within its small tubular neighborhood w hen the
length of the curve is not too larger than that of the geodesic when the ambient
curvature is negative.
We prove the F-distance estimate of simple closed curves whose proof is inspired
by the proof of Quantitative Constancy theorem for stationary v arifolds of Section
2 of [32]. They proved that if the total mass of the codimension 1 stationar y var-
ifold in a closed ( n+1)-dimensional manifold is mostly concentrated in a tubular
neighborhood of a 2-sided, closed and embedded hypersurface, t hen the varifold
distance estimate holds between the normalized varifold and the nor malized hyper-
surface. In our geodesic setting, we show that if the simple closed c urve is in a
tubular neighborhood of strictly stable geodesic with ambient negat ive curvature
and whose length is bounded above, then F-distance between the simple closed
curve and the strictly stable geodesic satisﬁes the quantitative es timate.
Letγbeastrictlystablesimple closedgeodesicin( S2,g)andGaussiancurvature
onγis negative. For Lemma 6.1 and Lemma 6.2, we take suﬃciently small hsuch
thatNh(γ) is a mean convex neighborhood. Let us take the Fermi coordinate
c: [0,L]×(−h,h)→S2of (12). Also deﬁne the distance function distgbetween
two tangent lines with a ﬁxed point in the Grassmannian manifold G1(S2) endowed
with the induced metric by ( S2,g) on the Grassmannian manifold G1(S2).
Lemma 6.1. Let(S2,g),γ,cbe as above and K(z)<0forz∈Nh(γ). There
existsC=C(L)>0satisfying the following property: For 0< ǫ < h2, if a simple
closed curve αhomologous to γinNh(γ)satisﬁes |α|< L+ǫ, then
(29) F(α,γ)< C(L)(h+√ǫ).
Proof.We work in the Fermi coordinate. Parametrize αby arclength as α(s) =
c(x(s),y(s)). Thus J2(x(s),y(s))x′2(s)+y′2(s) = 1 for s∈[0,|α|]. Indeed, we have
(30)/integraldisplay|α|
0/radicalbig
J2(x(s),y(s))x′2(s)+y′2(s)ds=|α|< L+ǫ.
By condition (1) and (2) of Jin (12), we have
(31) J(x,y)≥1
onNh(γ). Sinceαis a simple closed curve homologous to γ, by (31) we have
(32) L≤/integraldisplay|α|

J2(x(s),y(s))x′2(s)+y′2(s)−J(x(s),y(s))|x′(s)|ds < ǫ.
Consider the foliations by level curves {γt}t∈[−h,h]in (20), and denote γzas a leaf
in the foliation {γt}t∈[−h,h]containing z∈Nh(γ). Then we deﬁne θ(s)∈[−π,π]
to be a continuous angle function between the tangent vector dc(x(s),y(s))(∂/∂x)∈MORSE INDEX BOUND AND MORSE INEQUALITIES 17
Tα(s)γα(s)and the tangent vector α′(s)∈Tα(s)α. Then tan θ(s) =y′(s)/Jx′(s). By
combining (33) with J2(x(s),y(s))x′2(s)+y′2(s) = 1, we deduce
(34)/integraldisplay
α1−cos(θ(s))ds < ǫ.
We obtain an estimate on the total angle of α:

where the ﬁrst inequality comes from the H¨ older’s inequality and the second in-
equality is from the inequality θ2≤π2(1−cosθ) forθ∈[−π,π], and the last
inequality follows from (34).
Now we deduce the relation between the total angle of the curve αand the total
of the distance function distgwe deﬁned before the statement of Lemma 6.1. There
exists a constant C >0 such that distg(Tzα,Tzγz)≤C|θ(s)|atz=α(s). Thus
We have

Now we have the F-distance estimate along the squeezing map in Lemma 5.4
when the geodesic γis strictly stable and the ambient Gaussian curvature is nega-
tive:
Lemma 6.2. Letγbe a strictly stable geodesic on (S2,g), Gaussian curvature

existsC=C(|γ|)>0satisfying the following property: For 0< ǫ < h2/10, if
Φ :X→ Sis a continuous map in the smooth topology such that
sup{F(Φ(x),γ) :x∈X}< ǫ,
then there is a homotopy H: [0,1]×X→ Ssuch that H(0,x) = Φ(x),H(1,x) =γ
and the following F-distance estimate holds along H:
sup{F(H(t,x),γ) :x∈Xandt∈[0,1]}< C(|γ|)√ǫ.

and the following F-distance estimate holds along H:
(42) sup {F(H(t,x),γ) :x∈Xandt∈[0,1]}< C(|γ|)√ǫ.
Proof.For a given β, we can take the conformal deformation Gβof the metric

φ(c(x,y)) =−Ae−B/(h2−y2)by (15). We will specify βlater in this proof. Then
we consider the homotopy Hin (28) for this given β >0 for the general geodesic γ
case.
In a similar way to (22), we have

Note that ( Gβ)♯γis a strictly stable geodesic, the ambient Gaussian curvature is

Now consider the bound of (43) and (44). For (43), (1 −β)−1converges to 1 as
βgoes to 0. For (44), the right hand side exp( −φβ)((1−β)−1+Mhexp(−φβ))
converges to 1+ Mhwhich is smaller than 2 as βgoes to 0. Hence, we can take
β >0 such that max((1 −β)−1,exp(−φβ)((1−β)−1+Mhexp(−φβ)))<3.
By this choice of β, we take some smaller tubular neighborhood Nh′(γgβ) such
that ambient Gaussian curvature is negative and Nh′(γgβ) is a mean convex neigh-
borhood for some h′>0 by Lemma 5.3. Note that Nh′(γgβ) may be smaller than
Nh,gβ(γgβ). Let us take ǫ0=h′2/20. By Lemma 3.1 and (27), curves ( Gβ)♯(Φ(x))
are supported in Nh′(γgβ) for any x∈X. Thus, the family {(Gβ)♯(Φ(x))}x∈X

7.Proof of Theorem 1.2
In this section, we prove Theorem 1.2 on the Morse index bound. The following
theorem implies there are at least three simple closed geodesics on bu mpy sphere
with Morse index 1 ,2 and 3. These geodesics with Morse index 1 ,2 and 3 ex-
ist generically since bumpy metrics are generic in Ck-Baire sense from [ 1]. We
adopt analogous notions from [ 26] in our proof. We apply the interpolation lemma
(Lemma 6.4) we proved in the last section (cf. Theorem 3.8 in [ 26]).
Theorem 7.1. Suppose (S2,g)is a2-sphere with a bumpy metric. Then for each
k= 1,2,3there exists a simple closed geodesic γkwith
index(γk) =k
and the lengths of these three geodesics satisfy |γ1|<|γ2|<|γ3|.
Proof.Fork= 1,2,3,WLkis a ﬁnite set since the metric ( S2,g) is bumpy by
Corollary A.2 on spheres with bumpy metric. For each geodesic γ∈WLk, by (iii)
of Theorem 4.1, we can take the local min-max ball {Fv}v∈Bjto satisfy (47). Then
there exists some b(γ)>0 such that
(51) |(Fv)♯(γ)|< Lk−b(γ)22 DONGYEONG KO
forv∈∂Bjsince the length functional is strictly concave in the local min-max ba ll.
We pick small 0 < s <minγ∈WLkmin(ǫ(γ),b(γ)2C(Lk)−2/30,ǫ1(γ)/3) satisfying

2s(γ)∩WLk=γfor every γ∈WLk, whereǫ(γ) is a constant in Theorem 4.1,
b(γ) is a constant in (51), and ǫ1(γ) andC(Lk) =C(|γ|) are constants in Lemma
6.4 forγ∈WLk.
We can also ﬁnd a neighborhood BF
s′(γ) ofγsuch that |(Fv)♯(V)|<|γ|−b

v∈∂BjandV∈BF
s′(γ) by setting 4 s′< b:

where we used the deﬁnition of F-metric distance (3) for (52). We replace sbys′

We consider a minimizing sequence {Φi(x)}x∈X. HereXis ak-dimensional sim-
plicial complex. We apply Theorem 2.3 to obtain a tightened sequence {ˆΦi(x)}x∈X
such that

Λ({ˆΦi}) consists of multiplicity one geodesics and does not contain any geod esic
whose Morse index is larger than or equal to k+1.
Let Λ({ˆΦi}) ={˜γ1,...,˜γq}. We prove that there exists an element ˜ γ∈Λk({ˆΦi})
withindex(˜γ) =k. We show this by contradiction, thus let us assume that
index(˜γi)< kfor every i= 1,...,q. We consider a k-sweepout restricted on the
union of k-faces˜Xkofk-skeleton XkofXas in [26].
Since{ˆΦi}is a sequence of k-sweepout, we can let there is a σ∈Hk(˜Xk,Z2)

Now we ﬁx one connected component Wi,p. Fory∈supp(∂(/summationtext

deﬁne the function Ly:Bj→[0,∞) by
Ly(v) =|(Fv)♯(ˆΦi(y))|.

a unique maximum at mi(y)∈Bj

mi(y)/\e}atio\slash= 0 for every y∈supp(∂(/summationtext

First we consider the case of ∂(Wi,p) = 0. We apply Lemma 5.4 to squeeze the

Ifj= 0,|ˆΦi(y)| ≥Lkholds by Theorem 4.1 for every y∈Wi,p. Suppose
∂(Wi,p)/\e}atio\slash= 0 then |ˆΦi(y)| ≤Lk−a/2 fory∈∂(Wi,p) by (51). However, this

condition (3) holds.
We now apply Lemma 6.4 to construct a homotopy between {H1(1,y)}and
{(Fw(y))♯(γqp)}. Let us put ǫ= 3s < ǫ1in Lemma 6.4. Then by Lemma 6.4, there

whereC(Lk) is the constant from Lemma 6.4. The ﬁrst inequality of (62) is the

length bound directly comes from the length estimate (52) on the bo undary of local
min-max ball and the deﬁnition of F-distance (3):

mollify ˜zto make deformations depend smoothly of the parameters and we o btain
a smooth k-sweepout ˜˜zwith|˜W| ≤Lk−min(b/6,a/2) for every ˜W∈image(˜˜z).
Now we can construct a ∆-complex˜˜Zfrom˜˜zand a continuous map Ξ i:˜˜Z→ Sin
the smooth topology such that (Ξ i)∗(λk)/\e}atio\slash= 0 and |Ξi(y)| ≤Lk−min(b/6,a/2) for
anyy∈˜˜Z. This gives contradiction to the fact that the critical length is Lk. The
distinction among length Lkby Corollary 2.2 gives the latter conclusion.

Remark 7.2. Since we chose aandsafter taking an appropriate local min-max
diﬀeomorphism {Fv}v∈Bkandbfor length bound, the length along our interpolation
could be bounded with the number which is strictly smaller th an the width.
We now prove Morse index characterization in general spheres (Co rollary 1.4)
as following:
Corollary 7.3. For a 2-sphere (S2,g)with a smooth metric, for k= 1,2,3there
exists a closed and embedded geodesic γkwith
index(γk)≤k≤index(γk)+nullity(γk).
Proof.We can approximate ( S2,g) by a sequence of bumpy metrics {(S2,gi)}in
theC∞-sense by generic property of bumpy metric by [ 1]. Letγk,ibe an element of
the set of simple closed geodesics obtained by the theorem above fr omk-sweepouts
on (S2,gi). We obtain a geodesic γkin (S2,g) as a subsequential limit of γk,iby
the local compactness theorem and local uniqueness theorem of s olution of ODE.
The local convergence and the compactness give convergence to ward the geodesic
γk.
Moreover, we see the convergence of eigenvalues through the co nvergence of

8.Morse Inequalities
The goal of this section is to obtain Morse inequalities for the length f unctional
of simple closed geodesics with ﬁxed homotopy class on orientable sur faces. We
adopt arguments in [ 23] and explain diﬀerences mainly.
Let Π be a ﬁxed homotopy class of simple closed curves on M. We can deduce
a strong Morse inequality for a ﬁxed homotopy class Π and so on the w hole space
of simple closed curves with bounded length. Also we denote Sas the set of
(nonparametrized) embedded smooth curves on Min this section. We deﬁne Mg,Π
as a collection of (multiplicity one) simple closed geodesics with ﬁxed hom otopy
class Π in ( M2,g). In this section, let us suppose that the Riemannian metric gis
bumpy in M2which is C∞-generic.
Fork∈Z+anda∈(0,∞), letck(a,Π) be the number of simple closed geodesics
withindex(γ) =k,length(γ)< aandγ∈Mg,Π. Let also bk(a,Π) be ak-th Betti
number of the space of embedded curves
Za
Π={γ∈Π :|γ|< a}
with the varifold F-metric. Note that Za
Πis open in Π for any a. Also denote
thatbk(a) andck(a) to bek-th Betti number of the space of embedded curves
Za={γ∈ S:|γ|< a}and a number of simple closed geodesics with index(γ) =k,
length(γ)< a, respectively.
We start with the following lemma by the compactness theorem (Theo rem A.1)
and the ﬁniteness of simple closed geodesics with bounded length (Co rollary A.2):
Lemma 8.1./summationtext
Π/summationtext∞
k=0ck(a,Π)<∞so that/summationtext∞
k=0ck(a,Π)<∞for every a >0.
We have the following analogue of Proposition 3.3 directly from [ 23].
Proposition 8.2. For aC∞-generic Riemannian metric gonM, we have
•every simple closed geodesic is nondegenerate;
•and if
p1·length g(γ1)+...+pN·length g(γN) = 0,
with{p1,...,p N} ⊂Nand{γ1,...,γ N} ⊂Mg,Π, andγk/\e}atio\slash=γlwhenever
k/\e}atio\slash=l, then
p1=...=pN= 0.
We now see the relation between the relative homology Hk(Zt
Π,Zs
Π) withZ2-
coeﬃcients and numbers of simple closed geodesics. To obtain an ana logue of
Homology Min-Max Theorem 3.5 of [ 23], we adopt the arguments to obtain the
lower bound of Morse index of geodesic in the proof of Theorem 7.1, a nd apply
curve shortening ﬂow in place of area decreasing homotopies. Note that Local min-
max theorem (Theorem 4.1) and the interpolation lemma (Lemma 6.4) s till can be
applied even for general geodesics.MORSE INDEX BOUND AND MORSE INEQUALITIES 27
Theorem 8.3 (HomologyMin-max Theorem) .Letσ∈Hk(Zt

Suppose that, for some ǫ >0, there is no γ′∈Mg,Πwithlength(γ′)∈(s−ǫ,s)and
index(γ′)≤k−1. ThenW(σ)∈[s,t)withW(σ)>0ifs= 0. Moreover there
existsγ∈Mg,Πwithindex(γ) =kand
length(γ) =W(σ).
We obtain following proposition which is the analogue of Proposition 3.6 in [23].
An inspection of the proof gives that we can prove the following prop osition by
replacingthe interpolationresults in Almgren-Pitts setting by smoot h interpolation
lemmas (Lemma 6.3 and Lemma 6.4).
Proposition 8.4. Suppose that the metric gsatisﬁes the conditions in Proposition
8.2. Let γ∈Mg,Π∩Swithindex(γ) =kandlength(γ) =l. For every ǫ >0, there
existsl−ǫ < s < l < t < l +ǫsuch that
bi(Zt

Π) = 0 ifi/\e}atio\slash=k (64)
bk(Zt
Π,Zs
Π) = 1. (65)
Proof.We describe the outline of the proof of Proposition 3.6 of [ 23] and mainly
discuss about the modiﬁcations one needs to make.
There is a δ >0 such that γis the unique element of Mg,Πwhose length is in
(l−δ,l+δ) since our choice of the metric satisﬁes Proposition 8.2. (64) follows
from Theorem 8.3 directly.
Let us considera local min-max family associatedwith γ. We take the functional
L∗in (11). As in the argument of the proof of Theorem 4.1, we can pick ǫ2>0
such that for any V∈IV1(S2) induced by simple closed curves with F(V,γ)< ǫ2,
we have L∗(V)> L∗(γ) unlessγ=V. SinceL∗is strictly convex by Theorem 5 in
[33], we can pick κ=κ(α,γ,ǫ2)>0such that for Vinduced by simple closed curves
withF(V,γ)≤ǫ2andL∗(V)≤L∗(γ) +κ, thenF(V,γ)≤α. Let us choose tto
be close to lsuch that t−l <min{δ,κ(ǫ2/16,γ,ǫ2),2√ǫ0C(l)}, whereǫ0andC(l)
are constants from Lemma 6.3. Then we take a local min-max family {Fv}v∈Bk
satisfying (47) and
(66) F((Fv)♯(γ),γ)≤min(ǫ2/4,(t−l)2/16C′(l)2),
where we take C′(l) as a larger one between two constants C(l) from Lemma 6.3
and Lemma 6.4 and for all v∈Bk.
Moreover, let us choose 0 < b <min(δ,(t−l)2/4C(l)2) such that
(67) |(Fv)♯(γ)|< l−b
for anyv∈∂Bk.
Suppose that Φ :Bk→IV1(S2) is deﬁned as Φ(v) = (Fv)♯(γ), then we deﬁne
the relative homology class as following:
σ=Φ∗([Bk])∈Hk(Zt,Zl−b/4),
where [Bk] is a generator of Hk(Bk,∂Bk). We obtain the following claim by fol-
lowing the proof of Claim 3.7 in [ 23].28 DONGYEONG KO
Claim 8.5. σ/\e}atio\slash= 0.
The proposition directly follows from the following claim:
Claim 8.6. Hk(Zt,Zl−b/4) ={0,σ}.
Proof.Let 0/\e}atio\slash=σ∈Hk(Zt,Zl−b/4). By Theorem 8.3, W(σ) =l. We can suppose
that there is a minimizing sequence {Φj}ofmaps Φ j:X→ Ztsuch that Φ j(∂X)⊂
Zl−b/4, whereXis ak-dimensional ∆-complex and whose width is W(σ) =land
(Φj)∗([X]) =σ. By Proposition 8.2, the only element of the critical set Λ( {Φj}) is
γ. By applying Theorem 2.3, we obtain a pulled-tight minimizing sequence {ˆΦj(x)}
such that there exists η >0 for given small s >0 satisfying
(68) {ˆΦj(x)∈IV1(S2) :|ˆΦj(x)| ≥l−η} ⊂BF
s(γ)
forsuﬃcientlarge iandletustake0 < s <min(b2C′(l)−2/16,(t−l)2C′(l)−2/16,ǫ1/3)
and 0< η < b/ 8, where ǫ1is a constant from Lemma 6.4.
We ﬁxiand take a barycentricsubdivision of Xsuch that F(Φi(x),Φi(y))< η/2
whenever xandyare in the same simplex of the subdivision. We deﬁne Vas the
union of all k-simplicies t∈Xsuch that there exists x∈twith|ˆΦi(x)| ≥l−η/2.
For anyx′∈t∈V, we have |ˆΦi(x′)| ≥l−η. By our choice of bandη,V∩∂X=.
In particular, we have the following length bound for every y∈∂V:
l−η≤ |ˆΦi(y)| ≤l−η/2.
By modifying homotopies in (59) and (61) (after changing constant s), we have
the homotopy H1: [0,1]×∂V→IV1(S2) induced by length-decreasing ﬂow
{φy(·,t)}t≥0⊂Diff(Bk) in (58) satisfying
(1)H1(0,y) =ˆΦi(y)
(2)F(H1(1,y),(Fw(y))♯(γ))< η/4forsomecontinuousfunction w:∂V→∂Bk
(3)|H1(t,y)|< l−η/2
for every ( t,y)∈[0,1]×∂V. Also, we have following F-distance estimate
F(H1(t,y),γ) =F((Fφy(0,t0t))♯(ˆΦi(y)),γ)
≤F((Fφy(0,t0t))♯(ˆΦi(y)),(Fφy(0,t0t))♯(γ))+F((Fφy(0,t0t))♯(γ),γ)
≤2s+(t−l)2/16C′(l)2≤(t−l)2/4C(l)2. (69)
Then we have a homotopy H2: [0,1]×∂V→IV1(S2) such that
(1)H2(0,y) =H1(1,y) andH2(1,y) = (Fw(y))♯(ˆΦi(y))
(2)F(H2(t,y),(Fw(y))♯(γ))< b/2 so|H2(t,y)|< l−b/2
for every ( t,y)∈[0,1]×∂V. In particular, we have
F(H2(t,y),γ)≤F(H2(t,y),(Fw(y))♯(γ))+F((Fw(y))♯(γ),γ)
≤b/2+(t−l)2/16C(l)2≤(t−l)2/4C(l)2. (70)
We deﬁne Qas a cone over ∂Vand ˆw:Q→Bkas a continuous map sending the
vertex of the cone to origin and such that ˆ w(y) =w(y) for every y∈∂V=∂Q.
We consider the following ∆-complex Cwithout boundary given by
C:=V∪([0,2]×∂V)∪Q.
We deﬁne the continuous map Ψ : C→IV1(S2) as
Ψ(x) =ˆΦi(x),MORSE INDEX BOUND AND MORSE INEQUALITIES 29
forx∈V,
Ψ(s,y) =H1(s,y)
for (s,y)∈[0,1]×∂V,
Ψ(s,y) =H2(s,y)
for (s,y)∈[1,2]×∂V, and
Ψ(q) = (Fˆw(q))♯(γ)
forq∈Q. We now construct a homotopy H3between Ψ( C) andγinZtto show
that
(71) Ψ ∗([C]) = 0∈Hk(Zt,Zl−b/2).
By (66), (68), (69), (70), we can apply Lemma 6.3 for ǫ= (t−l)2/4C(l)2, and
obtain the homotopy H3: [0,1]×C→IV1(S2) such that
(1)H3(0,p) = Ψ(p) andH3(1,p) =γ
(2)F(H3(t,p),γ)<(t−l)/2
for every ( t,p)∈[0,1]×C. The deﬁnition of F-distance (3) gives
|H3(t,p)| ≤ |γ|+F(H3(t,p),γ)≤l+(t−l)/2< t
for every ( t,p)∈[0,1]×Cand we have proven (71). We can ﬁnish the proof by
following the remaining parts of proof of Claim 3.8 in [ 23]. /square

By combining Propositions and Theorems above, we obtain the stron g Morse
inequality in a ﬁxed homotopy class Π.
Theorem 8.7. For each a∈(0,∞),bk(a,Π)<∞for every k∈Z+and the Strong
Morse inequality for simple closed geodesics in a ﬁxed homot opy class Πhold:
cr(a,Π)−cr−1(a,Π)+...+(−1)rc0(a,Π)≥br(a,Π)−br−1(a,Π)+...+(−1)rb0(a,Π)
for every r∈Z+. In particular,
cr(a,Π)≥br(a,Π)
for every r∈Z+.
Remark 8.8. Let us denote SΠto be the space of embedded closed curves in a
ﬁxed homotopy class Π. Due to the classiﬁcation results of embedding of S1to
closed surfaces (See Gramain [16]and also follows from Grayson [17]), ifΠcontains
an essential curve, then SΠretracts to S1ifMis a torus, and is contractible if
genus(M)≥2. In case of Πcontains a trivial curve, SΠis homotopy equivalent
to the unit tangent bundle to M, for instance if M=S2thenSΠis homotopy
equivalent to RP3. This implies bk(a,Π)approaches to Betti numbers of S1, trivial
space, and unit tangent bundle of Mwith respect to MandΠas above, as agoes
to inﬁnity.
By adding up the terms for all homotopy class by ﬁniteness, we obta in
Corollary 8.9. For each a∈(0,∞),bk(a)<∞for every k∈Z+and the Strong
Morse inequality for simple closed geodesics hold:
cr(a)−cr−1(a)+...+(−1)rc0(a)≥br(a)−br−1(a)+...+(−1)rb0(a)
for every r∈Z+. In particular,
cr(a)≥br(a)30 DONGYEONG KO
for every r∈Z+.
Remark 8.10. We restrict our surfaces by orientable surfaces due to the te chnical
reason. To obtain a quantitative estimate as Lemma 6.4, we re lied on the construc-
tion of squeezing homotopy in Lemma 5.4. In this procedure, w e used the fact that
a tubular neighborhood of simple closed geodesic is a cylind er, which guarantees the
existence of a mean convex neighborhood of a strictly stable simple closed geodesic
after a suitable deformation.
Appendix A.Compactness theorem of closed geodesic with bounded
length
In this section, we introduce a one-dimensional analog of Sharp’s co mpactness
theorem [ 29] without an index condition.
Theorem A.1. LetMbe a closed surface. If {γk}is a sequence of closed, connected
and embedded geodesics with
H1(γk)≤L <∞
for some ﬁxed constant L∈Rindependent of k. Then up to subsequence, there
exists a closed, connected and embedded closed geodesic γwhereγk→γin the
varifold sense with
H1(γ)≤L <∞
and convergence is smooth and graphical for all x∈M. The multiplicity of conver-
gencemis 1 ifMis an orientable surface and is at most 2ifMis an unorientable
surface. Moreover, if γk∩γ=∅eventually, then γis stable, and index(γ)≥1
otherwise.
Proof.From Allard’s compactness theorem [ 2], we know the existence of γsuch
that (up to subsequence) γk→γin the varifold sense (and thus in Hausdorﬀ dis-
tance). The limit varifold γis a connected, integral and stationary 1-varifold.
Claim1:{γk}smoothly converges to γon a small neighborhood of
eachx∈γ.
For each k, the intersection Bδ(x)∩γkis a geodesic segment with zero curvature for
suﬃciently small δ. Compactness argument gives that {γk}locally and smoothly
converges to geodesic segments passing x.
Suppose there are more than one geodesicsegments passing xas a limit geodesic.
Sinceγkis simple, a segment of γkconverges to more than one piecewise curve
touching at x. The geodesic curvature of each segment of piecewise curves tou ching
xblows up at x. It contradicts to the fact that the geodesic curvature of γis zero.
Hence there is one geodesic segment passing xinBδ(x).
From above, Bδ(x)∩γconsists of disjoint geodesic segments. By the Theorem
(5) of Section 3 in [ 3], there are ﬁnite number of segments in Bδ/2(x)∩γ. By the
compactness argument for each segment, we have a smooth and g raphical conver-
gence at each point x∈γ.
Claim2: IfMis an orientable surface, then the multiplicity of the
convergence is 1.
By constancy theorem (Section 41 of [ 30]), the density of γis a constant positive
integer along γ. Suppose the convergence has a higher multiplicity m >1. Since γkMORSE INDEX BOUND AND MORSE INEQUALITIES 31
converges to γin a varifold sense, so does in Hausdorﬀ distance sense hence γkis
within a δ-normal neighborhood of γfor small δand suﬃciently large k. Moreover,
theδ-normal neighborhoodof γis diﬀeomorphic to S1×(0,1) sinceMis orientable.
On aδ-normal neighborhood Nδ(α) of a small closed single segment α:=Bδ(x)∩γ,
there is a set of functions {u1
k< u2
k< ... < um
k} ∈C∞(α),m >1 such that
γk∩Nδ(α) =/uniondisplay
y∈γ{Expy(ν(y)u1
k(y)),Expy(ν(y)u2
k(y)),...,Exp y(ν(y)um
k(y))},
wherey∈Bδ(x)∩γandν(y) is a normal vector at y. Since γkis locally k
disjoint segments for small neighborhood of each x∈γandγkdoes not have any
self-intersection point, graphs are separated to
γk=m/uniondisplay
i=1/parenleftBig/uniondisplay
x∈γ{Expx(ν(x)ui
k(x))}/parenrightBig
,
which are kdisjoint graphs. It contradicts to the fact that γkis a single simple
closed curve. Thus, the multiplicity of the convergence is 1.
Claim 3 : If Mis a nonorientable surface, then the multiplicity of the
convergence is at most 2.
We usethe same notationasClaim 2fora δ-normalneighborhoodandgraphs. Sup-
pose the convergence has a higher multiplicity m >2. In this case, the δ-normal
neighborhood of γis diﬀeomorphic to either a cylinder or a M¨ obius band. The for-
mer case is the same as claim 2 and the multiplicity is 1. By the similar argum ent
with Claim 2, the piece ofcurve containing Expx(ν(x)u1
k(x)) andExpx(ν(x)um
k(x))
is separated with other components of the curve due to the fact t hat theNδ(γ) is
diﬀeomorphic to a M¨ obius band and since γkis locally kdisjoint segments in a
small neighborhood. This contradicts to the fact that γkis a single curve. Hence
the multiplicity is at most 2.
Claim 4 : If γk∩γ=∅eventually then γis stable, and index(γ)≥1
otherwise.
This is due to the existence or nonexistence of strictly positive or ne gative eigen-
functionandthisargumentisthesamewiththecorrespondingargu mentin[ 29]./square
Corollary A.2. On(S2,g)with a bumpy metric, the set of all stationary integral
varifolds WLin the sphere whose support is a simple closed, smooth geodes ic and
mass is less than or equal to Lis ﬁnite.
Proof.Suppose WLis an inﬁnite set, by the previous compactness theorem there
exists an inﬁnite sequence {wk}converging to winWL. This induces a nontrivial
Jacobi ﬁeld of wand contradicts to the fact that the metric is bumpy. /square
