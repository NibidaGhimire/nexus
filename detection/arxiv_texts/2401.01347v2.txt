Discussion Paper:Theory of opinion distribution in human relations where trust and distrust mixed(2020)Convex Regions of Opinion Dynamics, Approaches to theComplexity of Binary Consensus with Reference toAddiction and Obliviousness:Integrated Dimer ModelPerspectiveYasuko Kawahata†Faculty of Sociology, Department of Media Sociology, Rikkyo University, 3-34-1 Nishi-Ikebukuro,Toshima-ku, Tokyo,171-8501, JAPAN.ykawahata@rikkyo.ac.jp,kawahata.lab3@damp.tottori-u.ac.jpAbstract:The ﬁeld of opinion dynamics has grown out of early research that applied magneticphysics methods to better understand social opinion formation. A central challenge in this ﬁeld isto model how diverse opinions coexist and inﬂuence each other. Opinions are rarely in completeagreement on social issues, and the formation of biaxial consensus is also very rare. To address thisissue, Ishii and Kawahata (2018) proposed an extended version of the bounded trust model that takesinto account the inﬂuence of dissent, distrust, and mass media. Their model aims to mimic morerealistic social opinion dynamics by introducing coeﬃcients representing the degree of trust anddistrust, rather than assuming convergence of opinions. In this study, we apply the dimer constructand the dimer model to develop a theoretical framework. Through numerical simulations, we alsoshow how the proposed model applies to actual social opinion formation. The study employs amodel that computes the castellain matrix , the distribution function/, and the probability ofdimer conﬁguration%(⇡)for convex regions with diﬀerent positions and distances, and analyzeshow changes in convex regions aﬀect the probability of dimer conﬁguration. The model takes intoaccount "dependence" and "forgetting" in opinion formation and discusses "distance" and "location"of opinions. Numerical simulation results show how the proposed model can capture real-worldsocial opinion formation processes. This study provides a foundation for a deeper understanding ofthe social opinion formation process and the development of eﬀective strategies for real-world socialproblems. Overall, this research provides a new methodology for capturing and understanding thecomplex dynamics of opinion formation in the ﬁeld of opinion dynamics. This theoretical frameworkand numerical simulation-based approach provides new perspectives in the ﬁelds of social science,physics, and computational modeling, and aims to provide new perspectives and contribute to adeeper understanding of social opinion formation.Keywords:Toroidal Structure,Dimer Conﬁgurations, Trust-Distrust Model (TDM), Dimer Alloca-tion, Social Opinion Formation, Castellane Matrix and Convex Regions, Analysis of Social Dis-agreement and Diversity1. IntroductionThe ﬁeld of opinion dynamics has grown steadily since theearly studies that applied magnetic physics methods to betterunderstand social opinion formation. In particular, it is rarefor people’s opinions to be in complete agreement, and inmany cases, especially on social issues, biaxial consensus isvery rare. A key challenge in this area is to understand andmodel how diverse opinions coexist and inﬂuence each other.

Their model aims to capture more realisticsocial opinion dynamics by introducing coeﬃcients repre-senting the degree of trust and distrust, rather than assumingconvergence of opinions. This approach sheds new light onthe ways in which individuals are inﬂuenced by social opin-ion.
Fig. 3: Results, Hexagonal Lattice Network GraphBased on this trust-distrust model (TDM), this paper pro-poses a new approach to opinion dynamics that applies thedimer allocation and Ising model. The purpose of this studyis to explore how the interaction between trust and distrustaﬀects social opinion formation. In particular, we use mathe-matical models to analyze how various external stimuli, suchas mass media, third-party opinions, and economic and po-litical factors, aﬀect people’s opinions. Our approach is to
Fig. 4: Results, Surface Representation:Torus Graph ofHexagonal Latticemathematically represent the dynamics of trust and distrust,which have not been addressed by traditional models. Thistheoretical framework provides new insights into the polar-ization of opinions, the process of consensus building, andhow these are reﬂected in social behavior. In this paper, weapply the dimer conﬁguration and dimer model to developthe theoretical framework, and use numerical simulations toshow how the proposed model applies to actual social opinionformation. This research aims to contribute to a deeper under-standing of social opinion formation by providing new per-spectives in the ﬁelds of social science, physics, and compu-tational modeling. In particular, this paper employs a modelthat computes the castellain matrix , the distribution func-tion/, and the probability of dimer placement%(⇡)for aset of convex regions with diﬀerent positions and distances.This introduced a method to analyze how changes in convexregions aﬀect the probability of dimer placement, modelingthat takes into account "dependence" or "forgetting" of thedistribution of opinions in opinion formation, as well as "dis-tance" and "location" to the opinions. We also attempted toanalyze from the perspective of the z-axis in order to discussthe "distance" and "positional relationship" to opinions. Theenergy function⇢(G, 4)is set based on the convex region inthe complement of the amoeba that describes the convex re-gion. Introduce the idea of assigning lower energy values toedges within the convex region and higher energy values toedges outside the convex region. We introduce an algorithmthat calculates the castellane matrix based on the convex re-gion and then calculates the probability of dimer placement.This theoretical framework provides an important exten-sion to existing models in the ﬁeld of opinion dynamics.In traditional models, the distribution of opinions is usuallymodeled under simplifying assumptions. For example, opin-ions are assumed to vary only within a certain range or onlycertain inﬂuencing factors are considered. However, the ac-tual social opinion formation process is much more complex,with many diﬀerent factors interacting. The proposed modelincorporates this complexity and allows for a more realisticsimulation of opinion formation.Furthermore, this study will explore in greater depth therole of individual inﬂuencing factors in opinion formation.In particular, it will focus on how external inﬂuences such asmass media, third-party opinions, and economic and politicalconditions aﬀect individual opinions. This will provide amore detailed understanding of the importance of externalstimuli and their dynamics in the opinion formation process.The proposed model also provides a new way to integratediversity and conﬂict in opinions and new insights into socialconsensus and disagreement.Numerical simulation results demonstrate how the pro-posed model can capture real-world social opinion formationprocesses. These simulations are an important step in vali-dating the model and exploring its applicability in real socialphenomena. Simulations allow us to observe how individualopinions change and evolve over time. This provides a basisfor better understanding the process of social opinion for-mation and for developing eﬀective strategies for real socialproblems.Overall, this research provides a new methodology forcapturing and understanding the complex dynamics of opin-ion formation in the ﬁeld of opinion dynamics. This theo-retical framework and numerical simulation-based approachaims to provide new perspectives in the ﬁelds of social sci-ence, physics, and computational modeling to contribute to adeeper understanding of social opinion formation.

Narrowly convex ideas that can beconstructed with amoebas andRonkin functionsWe consider the deﬁnition of a strictly convex set that canbe constructed using amoebas and Ronkin functions in thecontext of periodic hexagonal lattices (i.e., connected com-ponents in the complement of the amoeba inR2/ ). Inthis thesis, the starting point is to think about the formationof opinions in very small communities, opinions, and localzones. 1. Amoeba Complex Algebraic Varieties: For analgebraic variety+in complex number spaceC=, the amoebaA(+)is deﬁned as follows:A(+)={(log|I1|,log|I2|,...,log|I=|) | (I1,I2,...,I=)2+}whereI8are complex coordinates on+.2. Regarding Ronkin Functions in This Thesis: Ronkinfunctions are a concept in tropical geometry and are closelyrelated to amoeba theory. Ronkin functions calculate the"weights" of each connected component of the complementof the amoeba. For the amoebaA(+)of a complex algebraic

Fig. 9: Surface Representation:Monge Ampere equation,Amoeba and Ronquin numbers:23. Periodic Hexagonal Lattice: A periodic hexagonal lat-tice refers to a pattern of regularly spaced equilateral hexagonsin the plane. In this context, it is assumed that the connectedcomponents of the complement of the amoebaA(+)corre-spond to such periodic hexagonal lattices.4. Strict Convexity of the Complement of the Amoeba:The strict convexity of the complement of the amoeba meansthat its connected components are convex sets. In other words,it describes the property that any line segment connecting anytwo points in the complement of the amoeba is completelycontained within the complement.We will clarify the deﬁnition concerning the strict convex-ity of the complement of the amoeba. It refers to the convexityof the complement of the amoeba, combining concepts fromalgebraic geometry and convex analysis.3.0.1 Deﬁnition of Convex SetsA convex set is a set where any line segment between anytwo points within the set is completely contained within theset itself. Mathematically, a set⇠⇢R=is convex if, foranyG, H2⇠and any_such that0_1, the followingequation holds:_G+(1 _)H2⇠3.0.2 Amoebas and Their ComplementAn amoeba is the image of a complex algebraic variety un-der the logarithmic absolute value map. Speciﬁcally, for analgebraic variety+in complex number spaceC=, the amoebaA(+)is deﬁned as follows:A(+)={(log|I1|,log|I2|,...,log|I=|) | (I1,I2,...,I=)2+}The complement of the amoeba isR=\A(+), which refersto the region inR=not occupied by the amoeba.3.0.3 Strict ConvexityThe strict convexity of the complement of the amoeba meansthat this complement has convexity. In other words, for anytwo points?, @in the complement, the line segment con-necting them is entirely contained within the complement.Mathematically, if?, @2R=\A(+), then for any0_1,the following holds:_?+(1 _)@2R=<8=DBA(+)3.0.4 Signiﬁcance of Convexity of the Complement of theAmoebaThe convexity of the complement of the amoeba is crucialin tropical geometry and algebraic geometry. It suggests thatthe shape and structure of the complement of the amoebaare closely related to the algebraic properties of the variety+.Studying the convexity of the complement of the amoeba pro-vides various profound insights into the variety. In particular,the convexity of the complement of the amoeba often ariseswhen the variety is deﬁned by speciﬁc types of algebraicequations.3.0.5 The Convexity of the Amoeba’s Complement andIts Stereoscopic Understanding in the PeriodicHexagonal Lattice Dimer ModelThis problem lies at the intersection of combinatorics andstatistical physics.3.0.6 Consider a Bipartite Graph and Dimer Model onthe Torus
Fig. 10: Surface Representation:Periodic Hexagonal LatticeB=10
Fig. 11: Surface Representation:Periodic Hexagonal LatticeB=30The periodic hexagonal lattice consists of hexagons, witheach vertex connected by three edges. By mapping this latticeonto a torus, it can be treated as an inﬁnite lattice withoutboundaries. In the dimer model, these edges are covered by"dimers" (pairs of connected edges).In a bipartite graph on the torus, each vertex of the latticeis colored either "black" or "white," and vertices of diﬀer-ent colors are connected. Dimers are represented as edgesconnecting vertices of diﬀerent colors.Now, introduce the Kasteleyn matrix. It is used to calcu-late the number of dimer conﬁgurations on a bipartite graphon the torus. This matrix is constructed as follows:1. Associate "black" and "white" vertices of the graphwith rows and columns, respectively. 2. If an edge4of thegraph connects "black" vertex8and "white" vertex9, assigna nonzero value (e.g.,±1) to the matrix element(8, 9). ThisFig. 12: Surface Representation:Periodic Hexagonal LatticeB=50value depends on the orientation of the edge and the speciﬁcstructure of the graph.
Fig. 13: 2-Partite Graph on Torus==1003. The total number of dimer conﬁgurations is givenby the determinant (or its absolute value) of this Kasteleynmatrix.To connect the convexity of the amoeba’s complementwith the dimer model, it is assumed that the complement ofthe amoeba corresponds to a manifold with certain algebraicproperties, which can be mapped to the dimer conﬁgurationproblem.To establish the connection between the convexity of theamoeba’s complement and the dimer model, it is necessary toﬁrst mathematically understand each concept and then con-sider how to map them. Here, we provide a basic approachwith mathematical notation.

Fig. 15: Tile Mapping of Kasteleyn MatrixThe amoeba manifold is the image of a complex algebraicvariety+⇢C=under the logarithmic absolute value map.The amoebaA(+)is deﬁned as follows:A(+)={(log|I1|,...,log|I=|) 2R=|(I1,...,I=)2+}The convexity of the complement of the amoeba,R=\A(+), means that for any two pointsG, Hin the complement,the line segment_G+(1 _)H(where0_1) is entirelycontained within the complement.The dimer model is a problem of random matchings on agraph. In a graph⌧, a dimer conﬁguration is a set of edgeswhere each vertex is connected to exactly one edge.In the periodic hexagonal lattice dimer model, each dimercovers an edge of the hexagonal lattice. In a bipartite graph⌧on the torus, the Kasteleyn matrix is used to calculatethe number of dimer conﬁgurations.Points within the complement of the amoeba manifoldare related to the possibilities of dimer conﬁgurations. Thiscorrespondence can be seen as points in the complementrepresenting the "energy" or "probability weight" of dimerconﬁgurations.3.0.7 The Relationship Between the Convexity of theAmoeba’s Complement and the Stochastic Weight-ing and Arrangement in the Dimer ModelThe Convexity of the Amoeba’s Complement

Fig. 17: Surface Representation:Amoeba with Ronkin Func-tion Weights on Elliptic CurveThe convexity of the amoeba’s complement implies thatany straight line segment between any two points within thecomplement is entirely contained within the complement.Mathematically, when the complement of the amoeba,A2,is convex, the following relation holds for anyG, H2A2and0_1:_G+(1 _)H2A23.0.8 The Amoeba’s Complement and Its PropertiesConsider the region within the amoebaA(+)and denote itasR2\A (+). Speciﬁc points within the complement of theamoebaG2R2\A(+)are believed to correspond to speciﬁcalgebraic properties of the manifold+.

Here,⇡represents a speciﬁc dimer conﬁgurationon the graph⌧, and this probability may be expressed asfollows:%(⇡)=1/÷42⇡?4Here,/is the normalization constant (partition function).3.0.10 Associating the Amoeba’s Complement withDimer ConﬁgurationsPointsGwithin the complement of the amoeba are consideredto inﬂuence the stochastic weighting of dimer conﬁgurations.For example, pointGmay determine the "energy" of the dimerconﬁguration, which can aﬀect the probability?4. This maybe modeled as follows:?4=exp( V⇢(G, 4))Here,⇢(G, 4)is the energy function, andVis the inversetemperature parameter. This energy function represents therelationship between pointsGwithin the complement of theamoeba and the edge4, and the speciﬁc deﬁnition of thisfunction depends on the particular physical or mathematicalmodel.Ultimately, the probability%(⇡)of dimer conﬁgurationscan be constructed as a model that depends on the propertiesof pointsGwithin the complement of the amoeba:%(⇡)=1/÷42⇡exp( V⇢(G, 4))This model suggests how the geometric and algebraicproperties of the amoeba’s complement may inﬂuence thestatistical properties of dimer conﬁgurations.3.0.11 Quantiﬁcation of Dimer Conﬁguration Prob-abilistic Weights Based on the Convexity ofAmoeba Complements1. Deﬁnition of the Energy FunctionWe deﬁne the energy function⇢(G, 4)based on the convexregion within the complement of the amoeba, whereGis apoint in the complement and4is an edge of a dimer. PointsGwithin the convex region can be considered to reduce theenergy of dimer conﬁgurations. For example, the energyfunction might be deﬁned as:⇢(G, 4)= U·dist(G,ConvexRegion)Here, dist(G,ConvexRegion)represents the distance frompointGto the nearest convex region, andUis a positivecoeﬃcient.2. Probability of Dimer ConﬁgurationsThe probability model for dimer conﬁgurations is as follows:%(⇡)=1/exp  V’42⇡⇢(G, 4)!Here,/is the normalization constant (partition function),andVis the inverse temperature parameter.3. Calculation of the Partition FunctionThe partition function/is the sum of%(⇡)over all possibledimer conﬁgurations:/=’⇡exp  V’42⇡⇢(G, 4)!4. Analysis of the Relationship Between Convex Regionsand Dimer ConﬁgurationsWe observe how the probability distribution of dimer con-ﬁgurations changes by altering the position or shape of theconvex region. This involves changing the convex region andrecalculating the partition function/and each%(⇡).We describe speciﬁc solutions for calculating the parti-tion function using Monte Carlo methods and matrix-treetheorem. First, we explain the basic ideas of each method,and then we show how to apply these to the calculation of thepartition function.Monte Carlo MethodThe Monte Carlo method uses probabilistic sampling for nu-merical analysis. In this case, we generate random samplesfrom the probability distribution of dimer conﬁgurations anduse these to approximate the partition function.Formulas and Solution1.Initialization: Select an appropriate initial dimer con-ﬁguration⇡0. 2.Iteration: At each step, generate a newconﬁguration⇡8+1randomly from the current conﬁguration⇡8. This generation process might involve, for example, ﬂip-ping a randomly chosen edge. 3.Probability Calculation:Calculate%(⇡8)for each dimer conﬁguration⇡8and use thisto obtain an approximate value for the partition function/.For example,/⇡1##’8=1exp( V’42⇡8⇢(G, 4))Here,#is the number of samples.Matrix-Tree TheoremThe matrix-tree theorem is used to calculate the number ofall spanning trees of a graph. In the dimer model, it can beused to calculate the number of dimer conﬁgurations usingthe determinant of the Kasteleyn matrix.Formulas and Solution1.Construction of the Kasteleyn Matrix: Construct theKasteleyn matrix for the graph⌧. This matrix is similar

Ac-cording to the matrix-tree theorem, the absolute value of thisdeterminant equals the number of spanning trees in the graph.3.Calculation of the Partition Function: The number ofdimer conﬁgurations is proportional to the absolute value ofthe determinant, so the partition function/is calculated as/=|det( )|The Monte Carlo method is suitable for approximatingthe partition function based on sampling from the probabilitydistribution, but it may require a long computation time. Onthe other hand, the matrix-tree theorem is eﬃcient for certaintypes of dimer conﬁgurations, but it is not applicable to alldimer conﬁgurations. These methods will be chosen depend-ing on the nature of the problem and computational resourcesavailable.3.0.12 Concrete Computational Example for Analyzingthe Relationship Between Convex Regions andDimer ConﬁgurationsDeﬁne a convex region⇠within the complement of theamoeba and set up an energy function⇢(G, 4)for pointsGwithin this region. It is assumed that points within the con-vex region reduce the energy of dimer conﬁgurations. Forexample, you can set it up as follows:- For pointsGwithin the convex region⇠, the energyfunction is⇢(G, 4)= U(Uis a positive constant). - ForpointsGoutside the convex region, the energy function is⇢(G, 4)=0.3.0.13 Calculation of the Partition FunctionCalculate the partition function/and the probability%(⇡)for individual dimer conﬁgurations⇡:-/=Õ⇡exp( VÕ42⇡⇢(G, 4))- For each dimer con-ﬁguration⇡,%(⇡)=1/exp( VÕ42⇡⇢(G, 4))3.0.14 Alteration of Convex Region and Analysis ofProbability DistributionNext, change the position and shape of the convex region⇠and recalculate both the partition function/and each%(⇡)accordingly. For example, you can move the convex regionto a diﬀerent location or modify its size and shape to ob-serve how the probability distribution of dimer conﬁgurationschanges in response.3.0.15 Speciﬁc Computational ExampleAs an example, consider changing the convex region⇠froma small circle to a large circle. This alteration will aﬀect theenergy functions⇢(G, 4)associated with points within theconvex region, thereby causing changes in the values of thepartition function/and each%(⇡).(1)Calculate the partition function and probabilities forthe small circular convex region. (2)Change to a large cir-cular convex region and calculate the partition function andprobabilities again. (3)Compare and analyze the changes inthe probability distributions in both cases.Through this comparison, you can quantitatively under-stand how the size and position of the convex region aﬀectthe probabilities of dimer conﬁgurations.3.0.16 Impact of Amoeba Complement Convexity onDimer ModelsUnderstanding the Impact of Amoeba Complement Convex-ity on Dimer Models: Formulas and Solutions for Com-paratively Analyzing Probability Distributions for DiﬀerentConvex Regions1. Deﬁnition of Energy FunctionDeﬁne an energy function⇢(G, 4)based on the convex region⇠within the complement of the amoeba. This function shouldtake low values (e.g.,⇢(G, 4)= U) for pointsGinside theconvex region and high values (e.g.,⇢(G, 4)=0) for pointsGoutside the convex region.2.

Here, we consider localopinion dynamics with dependencies and forgetfulness usingdimer conﬁgurations.1. Dimer ModelConsider dimer conﬁgurations on a graph where each edgerepresents speciﬁc social opinions or behaviors (e.g., smart-phone dependence).2. Deﬁnition of Dependency RegionWithin the complement of the amoeba, model a speciﬁc con-vex region as a "dependency region." Points within this regionare assumed to strongly represent social dependence.Energy Function and Kirchhoﬀ Matrix1. Energy FunctionAssign low energy to dimer conﬁgurations within the depen-dency region and high energy to conﬁgurations outside theregion.2. Updating Kirchhoﬀ MatrixUpdate elements of the Kirchhoﬀ matrix based on the depen-dency region, assigning high weight (low energy) to edgeswithin the dependency region and low weight (high energy)to edges outside the region.Partition Function and Probability of Dimer Conﬁgura-tions1. Calculation of Partition FunctionThe partition function/is calculated based on the absolutevalue of the determinant of the Kirchhoﬀ matrix.2.Calculation of ProbabilitiesThe probability%(⇡)for each dimer conﬁguration is calcu-lated using/:%(⇡)=exp( VÕ42⇡⇢(G, 4))/4. Modeling Local Opinion Dynamics1. Parameters for Dependency and Forgetful-nessIntroduce parametersU(dependency strength) to representdependence andW(forgetting rate) to represent forgetfulness.2. Dynamics CalculationUsing the dependency and forgetfulness parameters, modelthe probabilistic change of dimer conﬁgurations over time.This can involve stochastic simulation methods like MarkovChain Monte Carlo, among others.The energy function can be set as follows, for example:⇢(G, 4)=( UifG2Dependency RegionWotherwiseHere,Grepresents vertices on the graph, and4representsdimer conﬁgurations. Such a model is highly intriguing formathematical modeling of social phenomena and behavioralpatterns. However, capturing the dynamics of real social de-pendence may require incorporating more complex factorsand phenomena into the model. Additionally, the results ofthis model may not directly apply to real social behaviorsand opinion formation, but they have the potential to providetheoretical insights. To analyze the variation in the probabil-ity distribution of dimer conﬁgurations for diﬀerent convexregions and understand the impact of amoeba complementconvexity on the dimer model, we employ the use of theKirchhoﬀ matrix in mathematical expressions.Concept of the Kirchhoﬀ MatrixThe Kirchhoﬀ matrix is used to calculate the number of dimerconﬁgurations in the dimer model. It is a matrix with entriescorresponding to each edge in the graph, and these entriesrepresent the weight (or energy) of dimer conﬁgurations.Deﬁnition of the Energy FunctionBased on the convex regions within the complement of theamoeba, we deﬁne an energy function⇢(G, 4). We assignlow energy values to edges within the convex region and highenergy values to edges outside the convex region.Recalculation of the Kirchhoﬀ MatrixThe Kirchhoﬀ matrix is recalculated for diﬀerent convex re-gions. The entries of the Kirchhoﬀ matrix are updatedbased on the energy function⇢(G, 4). The determinant (orabsolute value thereof) of this matrix represents the numberof possible dimer conﬁgurations on the graph.Calculation of the Partition Function and Prob-abilitiesThe probability%(⇡)for dimer conﬁgurations is calculatedusing the partition function/. This is expressed as:/=’⇡exp( V’42⇡⇢(G, 4))%(⇡)=exp( VÕ42⇡⇢(G, 4))/Here,Vis the inverse temperature parameter, and⇡rep-resents a speciﬁc dimer conﬁguration.Analyzing the Impact of Convex RegionChangesFor diﬀerent settings of convex regions, we compute theKirchhoﬀ matrix , the partition function/, and the prob-abilities of dimer conﬁgurations%(⇡). This allows us toanalyze how changes in convex regions aﬀect the probabili-ties of dimer conﬁgurations.Interpretation of ResultsBy comparing the changes in probability distributions%(⇡)for diﬀerent convex region settings, we can quantitativelyunderstand how amoeba complement convexity impacts thestatistical physics properties of the dimer model. This analysiscan reveal the inﬂuence of speciﬁc arrangements or shapesof convex regions on the probability distribution of the dimermodel.Mapping the Results of Opinion Dynamics to AmoebaComplement Convexity and the Dimer Model4.1 Mapping Amoeba Complement Convexityto the Dimer Model1. Results of Opinion DynamicsLet the results of opinion dynamics be denoted as$(G, C),whereGrepresents positions on the graph, andCrepresentstime.2. Mapping to Amoeba ComplementDeﬁne the convexity at pointsHwithin the amoeba’s comple-ment based on the results of opinion dynamics$(G, C). Forexample, the strength of opinions at speciﬁc positions in theconvex region may be considered to represent the degree ofconvexity at those points.4.2 Ronkin Functions and Legendre TransformThe Ronkin function!(G)calculates the "weight" of con-nected components at pointsGwithin the amoeba’s comple-ment. Legendre transforms are typically used to investigatethe properties of convex functions, but directly performinga Legendre transform on Ronkin functions is not common.However, as a theoretical approach, it can be considered asfollows:1. Ronkin Function!(G)**: Consider the Ronkin function at pointsGwithin theamoeba’s complement.2. Legendre TransformThe Legendre transform of the Ronkin function (?)may bedeﬁned as follows: (?)=supG[h?, Gi !(G)]Here,?represents the dual variable, andh?, Gidenotes theinner product.This Legendre transform can potentially oﬀer an alter-native perspective to capture the characteristics of amoebacomplement convexity, viewing it from a diﬀerent standpoint.5. Discussion5.1 Analysis of Convex Regions in Opinion Dy-namics
Fig. 24: Probability Distribution (Small, Large Convex Re-gion)
Fig. 25: Heatmap (Small, Large Convex Region)In this analysis, we explore the eﬀects of diﬀerent sizedconvex regions on the probability distributions in an opiniondynamics model. We use a grid-based approach to calculatethe energy function and the subsequent probability distribu-tion across two diﬀerent convex regions.5.2 Formulas and ParametersThe core of our analysis is based on the following parametersand formulas:Grid size:=_?>8=CB=100Energy coeﬃcients:U=1.0andV=1.0Radii of convex regions:A038DB_B<0;;=5andA038DB_;0A64=10Grid deﬁnition:G, Hranges from -15 to 15.Energy Function:⇢(G, H, A038DB)=( UifpG2+H2A038DB0otherwiseDistribution Function:/=’exp( V·⇢)%=exp( V·⇢)/The intent of this analysis is to understand how the sizeof the convex region impacts the probability distribution ina spatial model. The model simulates opinion dynamics byconsidering diﬀerent energy levels within and outside convexregions. Energy is lower inside the convex region, symboliz-ing a higher level of agreement or consensus. Two scenariosare examined: one with a smaller convex region and anotherwith a larger one. This comparison helps in understandingthe role of spatial factors in opinion dynamics and consensusformation.The Results depict two sets of graphical representations il-lustrating a probability distribution across a two-dimensionalgrid. These representations demonstrate how the size of aconvex region inﬂuences the distribution within the frame-work of an opinion dynamics model. The ﬁrst set of imagesis presented as a 3D cylindrical graph, while the second setcorresponds to a 2D heatmap.The probability distribution is governed by an energyfunction that relies on the distance between the grid’s centerand a point(G, H), as well as whether the point falls withina speciﬁed convex region deﬁned by its radius. The smallerconvex region has a radius of 5 units, while the larger one hasa radius of 10 units.(1)Social Phenomena Consideration:The graphics maybe illustrating the concentration of opinions within a so-cial network, where opinion dynamics are constrainedby geographical or ideological boundaries representedby the convex regions. The smaller region could signifya closely-knit community with a strong consensus, re-sulting in a higher probability density. In contrast, thelarger region may represent a more dispersed communitywith a weaker consensus, leading to a lower probabilitydensity.(2)Media Inﬂuence Consideration:If the convex regionssymbolize the reach or inﬂuence of diﬀerent mediasources, these models might be demonstrating that asmaller media source exerts a more potent yet localizedimpact on public opinion. Conversely, a larger mediasource has a broader but less intense inﬂuence.(3)Consensus Formation Consideration:Concerningconsensus formation, these models may suggest thatsmaller groups (represented by the small convex region)ﬁnd it easier to reach consensus, resulting in a higherprobability density. In contrast, larger groups (indicatedby the large convex region) may exhibit a more diverserange of opinions and a less concentrated consensus.(4)Consideration of Reconstruction from a DimerModel to a Torus:If we interpret the convex regions asconstraints within a dimer model, the images could rep-resent the impact of these constraints on the probabilitydistribution of dimers within a torus-shaped lattice. Asmaller constraint might correspond to a higher bindingenergy within a conﬁned area, while a larger constraintsigniﬁes a more broadly distributed energy distribution.(5)Dimer Model Consideration:In a dimer model, whereeach dimer covers two adjacent lattice points, thesegraphs could represent the likelihood of dimer place-ment. The smaller region suggests a higher concentra-tion of dimers, implying greater energetic favorabilityfor dimer formation within a constrained space.(6)Consideration of Phase Transition of Partial Opin-ions:The concept of phase transitions could apply toopinion dynamics, where the high probability densitywithin the small convex region might indicate an or-dered phase (consensus), while the lower density withinthe large region could signify a disordered phase (di-verse opinions). Investigating the transition betweenthese phases could involve varying the size of the con-vex region.5.3 Analysis of Probability Distribution in aGrid-Based ModelThis results presents an analytical overview of a grid-basedmodel used for calculating and visualizing probability dis-tributions. The model incorporates the concept of energyfunctions within a convex region and utilizes network graph-ing to represent the distribution.5.4 Formulas and ParametersThe model is deﬁned by the following parameters and formu-las: Results of four images oﬀers additional visual represen-tations of a probability distribution derived from a grid-basedmodel utilizing an energy function, as deﬁned by the pa-rameters and formulas provided.

Fig. 27: Heatmap of Probability Distribution(1)Social Phenomena Consideration:The 3D probabilitydistribution and its corresponding visual representationsmay depict how individuals within a society (as deﬁnedby the convex region) are inﬂuenced to adopt a com-mon opinion. The concentration of higher probabilitieswithin the convex region could suggest a strong localizedagreement or adherence to a cultural norm.

Fig. 29: Probability Distribution Curve(2)Media Inﬂuence Consideration:These visualizationscould serve as a means to examine the impact of mediawithin a deﬁned range (the convex region). The unifor-mity observed within the convex region may indicate thatmedia inﬂuence is substantial and evenly spread withinthat area but does not extend beyond its boundaries.(3)Consensus Formation Consideration:The networkgraph may represent individuals within a network, whilethe heatmap illustrates the likelihood of consensus for-mation within the community. The distinct boundary ofthe convex region implies that consensus is more likelyto be achieved within this community than outside of it.(4)Reconstruction from a Dimer Model to a Torus Con-sideration:In the context of a network of dimers, theuniform distribution within the convex region on thenetwork graph might suggest a stable conﬁguration ofdimers. This could be particularly relevant when con-sidering the transition of a dimer model from a planar toa toroidal topology.(5)Dimer Model Consideration:The network graphmight showcase potential sites for dimers in a latticemodel, where the central area (convex region) indicatesa high probability of dimer occupation due to favorableenergy states.(6)Phase Transition of Partial Opinions Consideration:The probability distribution could be employed to modelphase transitions within a system of opinions. The sharpboundary of the convex region in the heatmap could sig-nify a critical threshold, where a phase transition occurs,distinguishing a phase of uniform opinions within the re-gion from a phase of diverse opinions outside of it.These results representations are likely generated by as-signing lower energy values (resulting in higher probabilities)to grid points situated within the convex region, as dictatedby the provided energy function. The distribution functionsubsequently normalizes these probabilities across the entiregrid.6. Analysis of Opinion Dynamics on aTorus GraphThis results details the simulation parameters, analytical in-tent, and visualization techniques for a study of opinion dy-namics on a torus graph. The aim is to study how opinionsevolve over time on a torus graph, considering the eﬀects ofdependence and forgetting. The convex region represents anarea of high consensus or agreement, and its impact on theoverall opinion dynamics is analyzed.

The accompany-ing description suggests a simulation of opinion dynamics onthis torus, incorporating parameters like dependence strengthand forgetting rate. These dynamics are subsequently visual-ized on the torus graph.(1)Social Phenomena Consideration:The distributionof opinions on a torus might symbolize a society withperiodic boundary conditions, where the society’s edgesconnect seamlessly to form a closed community withcyclical social dynamics.(2)Media Inﬂuence Consideration:The torus graphcould simulate media inﬂuence that spans the entire so-ciety but exhibits a cyclic nature. Dependence and for-getting factors might reﬂect how older media narrativescan resurface and impact current opinions.(3)Consensus Formation Consideration:The modelcould illustrate how consensus emerges in a society with-out clear "edges" or "boundaries," where each opinionhas the potential to circulate and inﬂuence the entirenetwork. The forgetting rate may represent the dissipa-tion of consensus over time, while dependence strengthcould signify the pull of a strong societal norm.(4)Reconstruction from a Dimer Model to a Torus Con-sideration:If we interpret the torus as a dimer model,the visualization might showcase how dimer placements(pairs of opinions) interact across a periodic boundarycondition. These dynamics may elucidate the attainmentof stable conﬁgurations over time.(5)Dimer Model Consideration:In a dimer model, eachnode could symbolize a molecule, and the edges mightrepresent bonds. The torus topology then reveals howmolecules at opposite ends can still be neighbors, inﬂu-encing the overall system’s stability.(6)Phase Transition of Partial Opinions Consideration:The opinion dynamics might simulate a phase transitionwherein the system shifts from a disordered state (diverseopinions) to an ordered state (consensus) or vice versa.The convex region could represent a ’nucleation’ sitewhere this transformation initiates.(7)Dependence Consideration:The dependence strength(U) in the model may signify social reliance or peerpressure within the network. A zero dependence valueimplies that opinions change independently of others,possibly indicating a highly individualistic society.(8)Forgetting Consideration:The forgetting rate (W)could indicate the pace at which society forgets pastopinions or events, resulting in a gradual loss of mem-ory.The simulation parameters and mathematical formula-tions provided indicate a model in which each node up-dates its opinion based on its current state, the inﬂuenceof consensus within the convex region, and a naturaltendency to forget or move away from previous opin-ions. The interplay between these factors determineshow opinions evolve over time on the torus graph.7.2 Opinion Distribution
Fig. 33: Opinion DistributionThe provided results conducts a simulation of opiniondynamics over a grid, updating opinions at each timestepbased on a rule that considers a central convex region ofinﬂuence and a forgetting rate.(a)Social Phenomena Consideration:The simula-tion may replicate how opinions are distributedwithin a society and how they evolve. The centralconvex region could symbolize an area of robustsocial, cultural, or political inﬂuence that signiﬁ-cantly shapes opinions within its boundaries.(b)Media Inﬂuence Consideration:In this context,the media might be construed as a central forceinﬂuencing opinions. The evolution of the opinionCDF over time may signify the changing impact ofmedia narratives on societal opinions, illustratinghow opinions can become more or less diverse astime progresses.(c)Consensus Formation Consideration:Theheatmap of the ﬁnal opinion distribution can re-veal regions of high and low consensus. In themodel, consensus formation could be impacted bythe central region, where opinions are more ho-mogeneous due to stronger local interactions orpersuasive communication.(d)Reconstruction from a Dimer Model to a TorusConsideration:Although this simulation isn’t di-rectly tied to a dimer model, if we were to interpretit within such a context, the nodes within the con-vex region might represent areas with a high con-centration of dimers, inﬂuencing the conﬁgurationof the entire network.(e)Dimer Model Consideration:If we envisage thegrid nodes as molecules in a dimer model, thesimulation could elucidate how molecular interac-tions lead to intricate patterns of dimer formation,particularly inﬂuenced by a central region (poten-tially representing an area with distinct physical orchemical properties).(f)Phase Transition of Partial Opinions Consider-ation:The simulation might be employed to ex-plore phase transitions in opinion dynamics, wherethe system transitions from a disordered state (di-verse opinions) to an ordered state (consensus) overtime. This transition could be inﬂuenced by central’nucleation’ points.(g)Dependence Consideration:Given the ‘alpha‘parameter is set to 0.0, this simulation assumes nodependence among opinions, implying a highly in-dividualistic society or a model where individualschange their opinions without regard for others’opinions.(h)Forgetting Consideration:The ‘gamma‘ param-eter introduces a forgetting mechanism, illustratinghow opinions can diminish over time. This as-pect may emulate real-world scenarios where pastinformation or beliefs lose inﬂuence, potentiallypermitting the introduction of new opinions or theresurgence of older ones.In the ﬁnal opinion distribution, the diverse col-ors represent the variety of opinions after 100timesteps, while the CDF plots elucidate how theprobability of lower or higher opinions ﬂuctuatesover time, oﬀering insights into the dynamics ofopinion formation and alteration.8. Opinion Distribution,Dependence and ForgettingResults provided, collectively represents a simu-lation of opinion dynamics where the strength ofdependence (U) and the rate of forgetting (W) arenot constants but instead follow normal distribu-tions. This simulation aims to model the evolution
Fig. 34: Opinion Distributionof each individual’s opinion within a grid spacewhile considering the inﬂuence of a central region.i.Phase Transition of Partial Opinions Con-sideration:The ﬂuctuating values ofUandWcan lead to intricate behaviors in opinion dy-namics, including phase transitions. For in-stance, whenUis high andWis low at a giventimestep, opinions may rapidly converge, re-sulting in a phase where a single opinion dom-inates (a consensus phase). Conversely, ifUdecreases orWincreases, opinions might di-verge, leading to a disordered phase. Thevariability inUandWmay thus induce transi-tions between consensus and diversity withinthe opinion landscape.ii.Dependence Consideration:The distribu-tion ofUvalues across timesteps introducesvariability in the strength of dependenceamong individuals’ opinions. A higherUvalue suggests that individuals are more likelyto be inﬂuenced by the prevailing opinionwithin the central region, while a lowerUindi-cates a tendency towards independence. Therandom variation inUcaptures the real-worldscenario where social inﬂuence can ﬂuctuatedue to various factors, such as changing soci-etal norms or the impact of signiﬁcant events.iii.Forgetting Consideration:Similarly, thedistribution ofWvalues represents the rate atwhich individuals forget or move away fromtheir previous opinions. A higherWvaluesuggests a faster rate of opinion change, po-tentially due to factors like short news cyclesor rapidly changing social contexts. The vari-ability inWreﬂects the dynamic nature ofmemory and the impact of continuous infor-mation ﬂow on opinion stability.The provided image illustrates the distributions ofUandWacross the timesteps, providing a visual un-derstanding of how these parameters change overtime. This variability could result in a dynamicopinion landscape where periods of high consen-sus are interspersed with periods of diverse opin-ions, potentially creating a complex and evolvingsocial model.8.1 Opinion Distribution, Dependenceand Forgetting

Fig. 36: 3D Heatmap of the Kasteleyn MatrixResults provided are the outcomes of the supplied
Fig. 37: Network Representation of the Graphcode, which performs a simulation of a physicalmodel using a graph theory approach on a 2D grid.i.Social Phenomena Consideration:Theheatmap of the Kasteleyn matrix and theaccompanying 3D plot can symbolize thestrength of connections within a social net-work. In this analogy, the grid points repre-sent individuals, and the weights represent thelikelihood of interaction or inﬂuence. Regionswith higher weights (warmer colors) might in-dicate stronger social ties or a higher probabil-ity of interaction, potentially corresponding tosocial clusters or communities.ii.Media Inﬂuence Consideration:If we in-terpret the graph as a representation of mediachannels or pathways, the distribution in theKasteleyn matrix could signify the varying in-ﬂuence that diﬀerent media outlets exert ondiﬀerent sectors of society. Peaks in the 3Dplot might represent areas heavily inﬂuencedby media, while valleys might correspond toareas less aﬀected.iii.Consensus Formation Consideration:Thenetwork graph depicts the potential pathwaysthrough which consensus could be reachedin a networked community. The distribu-tion in the Kasteleyn matrix may represent theease with which consensus can spread throughthese pathways, inﬂuenced by the underlyingnetwork topology.iv.Reconstruction from a Dimer Model to aTorus Consideration:Despite the networkbeing represented in a 2D plane, the princi-ples employed in constructing the Kasteleynmatrix could be extended to more intricatetopologies like a torus, especially when con-sidering periodic boundary conditions. Thisextension would alter the enumeration of per-fect matchings or consensus states.v.Dimer Model Consideration:The simula-tion might serve as an analytical tool for study-ing dimer coverings on a lattice, where theKasteleyn matrix plays a pivotal role. The de-terminant of this matrix is closely related tothe count of perfect matchings or dimer con-ﬁgurations, which is a fundamental concept instatistical physics.vi.Phase Transition of Partial Opinions Con-sideration:The variability observed inthe Kasteleyn matrix could signify diﬀerentphases of opinion dynamics within a society.High variation may imply a phase transition,transitioning from a disordered state charac-terized by diverse opinions to an ordered statewhere one opinion prevails.vii.Dependence Consideration:The weightsassigned to the edges of the graph, as reﬂectedin the Kasteleyn matrix, can be viewed as thestrengths of dependence between individuals.The heatmap and 3D plot illustrate the het-erogeneity in these dependencies, which mayevolve over time as interactions change.viii.Forgetting Consideration:Incorporatingforgetting into such models could involve re-ducing the weights of edges over time or be-tween timesteps. This would result in a dy-namic Kasteleyn matrix where the inﬂuenceof certain interactions decays, simulating theloss of memory or decreasing inﬂuence overtime.Results provide an intuitive means of comprehend-ing the abstract concepts inherent in the mathe-matical model. They help illustrate the intricateinterplay between network structure, interactionstrengths, and their consequences on the dynamicsof the system.8.2 Dependence and Forgetting MatrixResults simulation of opinion dynamics on a net-work. The visualization includes a 2D scatter plotshowing regions of dependency and forgetting, a3D surface plot of opinion strengths, and a networkrepresentation of a graph with nodes colored basedon their region.i.Social Phenomena Consideration:Thescatter plot reveals clusters of dependency

This could mirror real-world socialstructures where speciﬁc communities exhibitstrong mutual inﬂuence, while others experi-ence more ﬂuid opinion dynamics.ii.Media Inﬂuence Consideration:The dis-tribution of opinions in the 3D plot mightsignify how media inﬂuence varies across apopulation. Peaks could represent areas ortopics where media narratives currently dom-inate, while troughs might indicate subjects oflesser focus or older narratives that are beingFig. 40: Network Representation of the Graph:Dependencyand Forgetting Regionsforgotten.iii.Consensus Formation Consideration:Thenetwork graph featuring red and blue nodescan symbolize how consensus is more likely toform within the red, dependent regions, whilethe blue regions may denote a diversity ofopinions due to a higher rate of forgetting.iv.Reconstruction from a Dimer Model to aTorus Consideration:Although not explic-itly shown, the principles demonstrated by thegraph can be extrapolated to more complextopologies like a torus. This extrapolationmight be useful for studying periodic bound-ary conditions in opinion dynamics or dimermodels.v.Dimer Model Consideration:The Kasteleynmatrix, determinant, and Ronkin function, al-though not visually depicted, are mathemat-ical constructs that could relate to the enu-meration of dimer coverings in a graph. Thisenumeration method models pair interactionsin complex systems.vi.Phase Transition of Partial Opinions Con-sideration:The variance in opinion strengthswithin the 3D plot could signify a system un-dergoing phase transitions, shifting between adiverse set of opinions and a consensus. Thetransition dynamics depend on the interplaybetween dependency and forgetting.vii.Dependence Consideration:The red nodesin the network representation might symbolizeindividuals or groups with strong interdepen-dencies that resist opinion change. In contrast,blue nodes may represent less interdependententities that are more susceptible to forgettingor altering their opinions.viii.Forgetting Consideration:The blue regionsin the scatter and network plots may representthe concept of forgetting in a social network.They indicate individuals or groups that aremore inclined to change their opinions, for-get past inﬂuences, or be inﬂuenced by newinformation.9. Conclusion
Fig. 41: Dependency and Forgetting Regions Ma-trix:Network Representation of the Graph
Fig. 42: 3D Dependency and Forgetting Regions Ma-trix:Network Representation of the Graphresults fgenerates a two-dimensional gridgraph and visualizes it in both 2D and 3Dforms. Nodes are colored based on theirproximity to a deﬁned central area, indicat-ing regions of dependency (red) and forgetting(blue).A.Social Phenomena Consideration:Thedistribution of red and blue nodes couldillustrate how social cohesion (depen-dency) or dispersion (forgetting) occursin social networks. Red nodes may repre-sent tightly-knit communities with stronginterdependencies, while blue nodes mayrepresent areas where social ties areweaker, leading to a faster turnover ofideas or beliefs.B.Media Inﬂuence Consideration:Thevisualization could be interpreted as thevarying degrees of media inﬂuence acrossa population. Red nodes might be areaswhere media narratives have taken holdand are strongly inﬂuencing the popula-tion, whereas blue nodes could be lessinﬂuenced or more quickly moving on tonew narratives.C.Consensus Formation Consideration:The network graph may show the poten-tial for consensus-building within a com-munity. Red nodes represent areas wherea consensus is more likely to form due tothe higher dependency, while blue nodesmay represent a diversity of opinions dueto the increased rate of forgetting.D.Reconstruction from a Dimer Model toa Torus Consideration:While the net-work is visualized in 2D and 3D, the prin-ciples could be extended to analyze mod-els on a torus or other complex topologies,particularly in considering how local de-pendencies might aﬀect global consensuson a periodic boundary condition.E.Dimer Model Consideration:The gridgraph could represent the underpinningsof a dimer model where red nodes indicatea higher probability of dimer formation(pairing), perhaps due to favorable condi-tions or energies, while blue nodes indi-cate areas less conducive to stable dimerformation.F.Phase Transition of Partial OpinionsConsideration:The contrasting colorsin the visualization could be indicative ofa system that is capable of phase transi-tions, where certain conditions or externalinﬂuences could push the system from adisordered state (high opinion diversity)to an ordered state (consensus) and viceversa.G.Dependence Consideration:The rednodes are suggestive of areas with stronginterdependencies, which could corre-spond to societal segments where groupnorms or peer pressure are particularly in-ﬂuential in shaping individual behaviorsor beliefs.H.Forgetting Consideration:The bluenodes might represent the transient na-ture of information or beliefs in certainparts of the network, where ideas can bequickly replaced, and the retention of pastopinions is low.These visualizations serve as a model to un-derstand complex dynamics within networks,highlighting the interplay between local inter-actions and overall structure. The 3D repre-sentation adds depth to the analysis, showinghow these dynamics might play out over timeor in more complex, multi-layered systems.AknowlegementThe author is grateful for discussion with Prof.Serge Galam and Prof.Akira Ishii.
