We present a new derivation of Israel-Stewart-like relativ istic second-order dissipative spin hy-
drodynamic equations using the entropy current approach. I n our analysis, we consider a general
energy-momentum tensor with symmetric and anti-symmetric parts. Moreover, the spin tensor,
which is not separately conserved, has a simple phenomenolo gical form that is antisymmetric only
in the last two indices. Apart from the evolution equations f or energy density, ﬂuid ﬂow, and
spin density, we also ﬁnd relaxation-type dynamical equati ons for various dissipative currents. The
latter are consistently derived within the second-order th eory as gradient corrections to the energy-
momentum and spin tensors. We argue that this approach corre ctly reproduces the corresponding
Navier-Stokes limit of spin hydrodynamic equations. Throu ghout our analysis, the spin chemi-
cal potential is considered a O(∂) quantity in the hydrodynamic gradient expansion and reduc es
to thermal vorticity in the global equilibrium. New coeﬃcie nts appearing in the generalized spin
hydrodynamic equations are undetermined and can only be eva luated within a proper underlying
microscopic theory of a given system.
I. INTRODUCTION
Innon-centralrelativisticheavy-ioncollisions,the averagespinpo larizationofhadrons(e.g., Λhyperons)isobserved
along the global axis of rotation of the produced matter [ 1–9]. This result may suggest that constituents’ spin in
the hyperons is coordinated in a speciﬁc direction, implying that the q uark-gluon plasma (QGP) contains non-trivial
vortical structures [ 10,11], which in turn might be caused by the signiﬁcant amount of orbital an gular momentum
producedinsuchcollisions[ 12,13]. ThisphenomenonmimicstheBarnetteﬀect[ 14,15]whichdisplaysthemacroscopic
eﬀect of a quantum spin. Various theoretical approaches have be en explored to model the vortical structure of a QCD
plasma, e.g., hydrodynamicapproach[ 16–24], relativistickinetictheory[ 25–43], eﬀectiveLagrangianapproach[ 44–47],
quantum statistical density operators [ 48–53], holography [ 54,55], etc. Considering the triumphs of the relativistic
dissipativehydrodynamicframeworksinrelativisticheavy-ionpheno menology[ 56–58], severalextensionsofrelativistic
hydrodynamicswith spin degreesoffreedom for the vorticalﬂuids attracted alot ofattention. The spin hydrodynamic
frameworkshave a crucial role to play in understanding the collectiv e spin dynamics of relativistic strongly interacting
plasma because they may link quantum mechanical features of matt er with hydrodynamics.
To model the collective spin dynamics in relativistic spin hydrodynamic f rameworks, in addition to the usual hydro-
dynamic quantities, e.g., the energy-momentum tensor ( Tµν), one also introduces the 3-rank spin tensor ( Sλµν) [25].
The additional equations of motion resulting from the conservation of the system’s total angular momentum provide
information about the dynamical evolution of the spin tensor. One o f the fundamental conceptual diﬃculties in for-
mulating a theory of relativistic dissipative spin hydrodynamics is the p roblem of “pseudo-gauge transformations”.
Pseudo-gauge transformations imply that the forms of the energ y-momentum tensor and spin tensor are not unique.
In particular, for any energy-momentum tensor Tµνsatisfying the conservation equation, i.e., ∂µTµν= 0, one can
construct an equivalent energy-momentum tensor T′µνby adding the divergence of an antisymmetric tensor, namely
T′µν=Tµν+∂λΦνµλ[33,59,60]. Note that if Φνµλis antisymmetric in the last two indices then T′µνis also
conserved. The same construction of the spin tensor can also be o btained without aﬀecting the conservation of the
total angular momentum. Diﬀerent pseudo-gauge choices do not a ﬀect the conservation of total angular momentum
or energy-momentum, nor do these transformations have any imp act on the global charges (i.e., the global energy,
linear momentum, and angular momentum). Various pseudo-gauge c hoices, e.g., the canonical, Belinfante-Rosenfeld
(BR) [61–63], de Groot-van Leeuwen-van Weert (GLW) [ 64], Hilgevoord-Wouthuysen (HW) [ 65,66] forms and their
implications on the spin hydrodynamic frameworkare intensely debat ed in recent literature [ 17,18,20,33,52,67,68].
Without going into a speciﬁc microscopic theory, a model-independen t dissipative spin hydrodynamic framework

produced. This simple but rather powerful physical principle has be en implemented very rigorously to obtain the
Navier-Stokes-like theory of dissipative spin hydrodynamic framew ork [16,17,20]. In this framework, the energy-
momentum tensor consists of symmetric as well as antisymmetric co mponents. Moreover, following the earlier works
of Weyssenhoﬀ and Raabe [ 69], one considers a simple phenomenological form of the spin tensor, which is only
antisymmetric in the last two indices Sλµν=uλSµν[16,17,20]. Hereuµrepresents the time-like ﬂuid ﬂow four
vector, and Sµνrepresents the spin density in analogy with the number density. A line ar stability analysis for this
phenomenological ﬁrst-order spin hydrodynamic framework has been performed in R efs. [70,71]. These analyses
show that in the ﬂuid rest frame, the ﬁrst-order spin hydrodynam ic equations are generally unstable under linear
perturbation [ 70]. This is a rather interesting result because the instability manifests itself even in the ﬂuid rest frame,
and the source of this instability is the spin equation of state that re lates the spin density tensor ( Sµν) to the spin
chemical potential ( ωµν). Strictly speaking, it has been argued that only the spin density pe rturbation components
δS0iare responsible for the instabilities. Also an independent analysis of t his framework, for a boost invariant system
indicates unstable behavior in the evolution of the temperature ( T) and the spin chemical potential ( ωµν) [72]. These
instabilities can be generic and the ﬁrst-order (Navier-Stokes limit) spin-hydrodynamic framework can be highly
pathological. Second-order dissipative hydrodynamic frameworks have been argued to be free of stability as well as
causality issues [ 73–81]. We expect that such features will also remain intact for second-o rder spin hydrodynamic
frameworks. Such observation motivates us to go beyond the ﬁrs t-order theory.
In this paper, we construct a new second-order Israel-Stewart -like (IS-like) spin hydrodynamic framework using the
entropy current analysis [ 82–85]. Some eﬀorts have been already made to derive the second-order spin hydrodynamic
equations from an underlying microscopic theory [ 86,87] using spin-kinetic equations. Such a kinetic-theory approach
explicitly uses spin-dependent collision terms and is based on the mome nt method of kinetic equation. In this article,
we follow an alternative model-independent way based on the entrop y current analysis to derive the second-order spin
hydrodynamic equations [ 82]. Various second-order hydrodynamic theories for ‘spin-less’ ﬂuid , e.g., the Muller-Israel-
Stewart (MIS) approach [ 82,88,89], Denicol-Niemi-Molnar-Rischke (DNMR) approach [ 90,91], Baier-Romatschke-
Son-Starinets-Stephanov (BRSSS) approach [ 92], Chapman-Enskog approach [ 93–95] etc., have been routinely used
to explain the heavy-ion collision data. Although diﬀerent second-or der hydrodynamic theories can have a similar
structure, they are not exactly the same which is reﬂected in the h ydrodynamic evolution, particularly where the
gradients are large [ 96]. Such diﬀerences crucially aﬀect their application to explain the heav y ion collision data.
These diﬀerences may also become evident for second-order spin h ydrodynamic frameworks. The present calculation
can be considered as a complementary method to the kinetic theory approach to obtain spin hydrodynamic equations.
After this brief introduction, in Sec. IIwe discuss the Navier-Stokes theory of dissipative spin hydrodyna mics using
the entropy current analysis. Once the Navier-Stokes theory is d eﬁned we next move to the construction of the
second-order Israel-Stewart theory of dissipative spin hydrody namics in sec III. Finally, in Sec. IVwe conclude our
results with an outlook.

II. FIRST-ORDER RELATIVISTIC DISSIPATIVE SPIN HYDRODYNAM ICS
A. Macroscopic conservation laws
Phenomenological derivation of hydrodynamics for a spin-polarized ﬂuid is based on the conservation of energy-
momentum tensor Tµνand total angular momentum tensor Jλµν1[25,26],
∂µTµν= 0, (1)
∂λJλµν= 2Tµν
(a)+∂λSλµν= 0. (2)
The total angular momentum tensor, Jλµν=Lλµν+Sλµν, is the sum of the spin part, Sλµν, and the orbital part,
Lλµν= 2x[µTλν]. In principle, Tµν, andSλµνcan be obtained from a more fundamental energy-momentum tens or
operator and spin operator of the underlying quantum ﬁeld theory system. Utilizing Noether’s theorem from the
perspective of the quantum ﬁeld theory of Dirac fermions, the micr oscopiccanonical energy-momentum tensor is in
general asymmetric, and the corresponding spin tensor is totally a ntisymmetric [ 97]. We expect that the symmetry
properties of various microscopic currents will also be preserved a t the macroscopic level. Due to the pseudo-gauge
transformation Tµν, andSλµνare not unique. Using the arbitrariness in deﬁning the energy-mome ntum tensor and
the spin tensor, for phenomenological studies, one often uses an asymmetric energy-momentum tensor and a spin
tensor that is only antisymmetric in the last two indices [ 69]. The dissipative spin hydrodynamic framework with
thephenomenological form of the spin tensor has been discussed in Refs. [ 16,17]. Moreover, it can be shown that
thephenomenological spin-hydrodynamic framework with the spin tensor which is antisymm etric only in the last two
indices can be obtained from a properly deﬁned canonical spin-hydrodynamic framework with totally antisymmetric
spin tensor using a proper pseudo-gauge transformation [ 20]. In this work, we will ﬁrst overview the ﬁrst-order dissi-
pativephenomenological spin-hydrodynamic framework by considering the following forms of the energy-momentum
tensor and spin tensor,
Tµν=Tµν
(0)+Tµν
(1s)+Tµν
(1a)=Tµν
(0)+2h(µuν)+τµν+2q[µuν]+φµν, (3)
Sλµν=Sλµν
(0)+Sλµν
(1)=uλSµν+Sλµν
(1). (4)
The leading order contribution Tµν
(0)in Eq. (3) has the form of the perfect ﬂuid energy-momentum tensor,
Tµν
(0)=εuµuν−p∆µν, (5)
whereεis the energy density and pis the equilibrium pressure. The most general expression of Tµνcan contain terms
that are symmetric as well as antisymmetric under the µ↔νexchange. Therefore, we decompose the dissipative
part of the energy-momentum tensor Tµν
(1)into a symmetric part Tµν
(1s)≡2h(µuν)+τµνand an antisymmetric part
Tµν
(1a)= 2q[µuν]+φµν. The vector hµrepresents the heat ﬂow, while τµνis the symmetric part of the dissipative
correction such that τµν=πµν+Π∆µν. The tensor πµν(the traceless part of τµν) is the shear stress tensor and Π is
the bulk pressure. Analogously, qµandφµνare the antisymmetric dissipative corrections. These dissipative cu rrents
satisfy the following conditions: hµuµ= 0,τµνuν= 0,qµuµ= 0,φµνuν= 0,τµν=τνµ, andφµν=−φνµ. According
to the hydrodynamic gradient expansion ε,p, anduµscale asO(∂0) orO(1). But hµ,qµ,τµν, andφµνscale asO(∂).
The tensor Sµν=−Sνµin Eq. (4) can be interpreted as the spin density, Sµν=uλSλµν, in analogy to the number
density [16,17,20]. Consequently, the spin density is a leading order term in the hydrod ynamic gradient expansion,
i.e.,Sµν∼ O(1). The ﬁrst-order dissipative correction Sλµν
(1)satisﬁesuλSλµν
(1)= 0. Note that in general, uµSµαβ
(1)/negationslash= 0,
but due to the matchingcondition where Sµνcan be identiﬁed asthe equilibrium spin density weconsider uµSµαβ
(1)= 0.
The same matching condition also identiﬁes εas the equilibrium energy density, i.e., Tµν
(1)uµuν= 0. Using Eqs. ( 3),
1For simplicity, we assume that the system has no other conser ved currents.4
and (4) back into Eqs. ( 1) and (2) we obtain spin hydrodynamic equations,
Dε+(ε+p)θ=−∂·h+hνDuν+τµν∂µuν−∂·q−qνDuν+φµν∂µuν,

Due to the diﬃculty in specifying the ﬂow velocity, frame choices are c rucial in the setting of dissipative hydro-
dynamics2. In standard hydrodynamics (spinless ﬂuid) a natural hydrodyna mic frame choice is the Landau frame,
Tµνuν=εuµwith only a symmetric energy-momentum tensor. This implies hµ= 0. But in the spin hydrodynamic
frameworks in general due to the presence of an antisymmetric co mponent, one has two alternatives: (1) we can apply
the Landau frame choice but only in the symmetric part of Tµν. This implies that hµ= 0. (2) Instead of applying
the Landau frame condition only to the symmetric part of the Tµν, we can also include the antisymmetric part. In
that case, we obtain hµ+qµ= 0. This immediately implies that we can have hµandqµnonvanishing but satisfying
together the Landau condition. In this paper, we will keep the discu ssions general without imposing any speciﬁc
frame condition, unless otherwise stated.
B. Thermodynamic relations
In the presence of dynamical spin degrees of freedom, the laws of thermodynamics can be generalized to [ 16,17,20],
ε+p=Ts+ωαβSαβ,
dε=Tds+ωαβdSαβ,
dp=sdT+Sαβdωαβ. (9)
Here,Tis the temperature, sis the entropy density, and ωαβcan be interpreted as the spin chemical potential
conjugated to the spin density Sαβsuch that Sαβ=∂p/∂ω αβat a ﬁxed temperature T. The spin chemical potential
is deﬁned as a hydrodynamic variable in analogy with the chemical pote ntial and distinguishes spin hydrodynamic
frameworks from the standard hydrodynamic theories. However , there is a fundamental diﬀerence between these
quantities. The chemical potential is only allowed in hydrodynamics if t he corresponding current is conserved, e.g.,
baryon chemical potential in the presence of a conserved baryon current. But the presence of spin chemical potential
does not necessarily imply the conservation of macroscopic spin cur rent. In the language of the quantum statistical
density operator framework [ 51], in local thermal equilibrium, the spin chemical potential can only be c onsidered as
a Lagrange multiplier [ 98]. However, in global equilibrium, in the presence of an antisymmetric c omponent of the
energy-momentum tensor, the spin chemical potential can be sho wn to be related to the thermal vorticity, ̟µν=
−1
2(∂µβν−∂νβµ) [98]. Hereβµ=βuµandβis the inverse temperature ﬁeld.
Apart from the presence of spin chemical potential, the hydrodyn amic gradient ordering of spin-related quantities
appearing in Eq. ( 9) has been discussed earlier. Fixing the hydrodynamic gradient orde ring ofωαβis not straightfor-
ward. Since it is expected that in global equilibrium the spin chemical po tential can be expressed in terms of thermal
vorticity ̟µν, it is rather natural to consider ωµν∼ O(∂). But such a conclusion is only applicable if the energy-
momentum tensor is asymmetric [ 98]. This is a non-trivial aspect of the spin hydrodynamic framework as compared
to the standard hydrodynamic frameworks for spinless ﬂuids. In standard hydrodynamics, the derivative correction
terms vanish at global equilibrium. But all gradient terms do not vanis h in global equilibrium if we consider the
most generalized ﬂow conﬁguration, which is also true for spin-hydr odynamics. Using the framework of the quantum
statistical density operator, it can be shown that the most gener al ﬂow conﬁguration in global equilibrium, must fulﬁll
2The energy-momentum tensor Tµνcan typically have 16 independent components in four dimens ions. In dissipative hydrodynamics,
these 16 components correspond to ε,p,uµ,hµ,πµν,Π,qµ, andφµν. Due to the equation of state, the variables εandptogether give only
one unknown, while uµ,hµandqµhave three independent degrees of freedom due to the conditi onsuµuµ= 1,hµuµ= 0 and qµuµ= 0.
Bothπµνandφµνare orthogonal to uµ. Butπµνis symmetric and traceless. Hence, it has only ﬁve independe nt degrees of freedom.
The tensor φµνis antisymmetric, hence it has three independent component s. The bulk pressure Π is just a scalar representing one
degree of freedom. This counting summarizes to nineteen ind ependent components in the Tµνrather than sixteen. Therefore we have
the freedom to eliminate three degrees of freedom. The so-ca lled frame choice or the deﬁnition of uµreduces the number of independent
components to sixteen.5
the following conditions [ 99],
∂µβν+∂νβµ= 0, βν=bν+̟νλxλ, ̟µν=−1
2(∂µβν−∂νβµ) = constant . (10)
Hereβµ=βuµ,β= 1/T,bνis a constant four vector. The 2-rank antisymmetric tensor ̟µνis the thermal
vorticity, and one can clearly observe that it scales as O(∂) in the hydrodynamic gradient expansion. Thus, a generic
global equilibrium allows for O(∂) terms in the ﬂow conﬁguration. Consequently, the gradient orde ring of the spin
chemical potential ωµνis a contentious issue in the setting of spin hydrodynamics and has se rious ramiﬁcations for the
formulation of the spin hydrodynamic framework. A natural quest ion could be raised here on how to connect Sµν∼
O(1) andωµν∼ O(∂) when their hydrodynamic gradient orders do not match. This was r ecently discussed in Ref. [ 72]
as a new spin equation of state was constructed to match the grad ient orders of Sµνandωµνwithout any further
assumptions. Nonetheless, one can also consider diﬀerent hydrod ynamic gradient ordering of spin chemical potential,
particularly when the energy-momentum tensor is symmetric. A spin hydrodynamic framework was discussed in
Ref. [19] where the spin chemical potential is considered the leading order ( O(1)) in gradient order expansion. In this
paper, we will only consider the spin hydrodynamic framework with ωµν∼ O(∂).
C. Constitutive relations for dissipative currents in the N avier-Stokes limit
We observethat while there are in total twenty two independent co mponents of TµνandSµν, Eqs. (6)-(8) constitute
only ten equationsfor the ten independent variables T,uµ, andωµν. Note that, the hydrodynamicorderingofthe term
∂λSλµν
(1)in Eq. (8) is higher than the rest of the terms. Therefore, for the ﬁrst-o rder dissipative theory, we can neglect
Sλµν
(1). However, to close Eqs. ( 6)-(8), we still have to provide additional equations of motion for diﬀeren t dissipative
currents. This eventually reduces to ﬁnding constitutive relations satisﬁed by the tensors hµ,qµ, Π,πµν, andφµν
in terms of T,uµ,andωµν. Such constitutive relations can be obtained using the condition tha t, for a dissipative
system, the entropy is no longer a conserved quantity but rather will be produced [ 16,82]. The mathematical form of
the entropy current within the framework of dissipative ﬂuid dynam ics is, a priori, not known. As a result, it is not
trivial to obtain its evolution equation. However, one can proceed b y ﬁrst constructing the deﬁnition of the entropy
current in the absence of derivative correction terms, i.e.,
sµ=βνTµν
(0)+βµp−βµωαβSαβ. (11)
Notethatsuchadeﬁnition ofequilibriumentropycurrentcorrectly reproducesequilibriumthermodynamicrelation( 9)
if we identify sµ≡suµ, wheresis the equilibrium entropy density. For an interacting ﬂuid, we can gen eralize the
deﬁnition of entropycurrent givenabove to incorporatedissipativ e terms. The non-equilibrium entropycurrent ansatz
up to ﬁrst-order in hydrodynamic gradient expansion, i.e., in the Nav ier-Stokes (NS) limit can be written as,
sµ
NS=βνTµν+βµp−βωαβSµαβ
=βνTµν
(0)+βνTµν
(1)+βµp−βµωαβSαβ−βωαβSµαβ
(1)
=sµ+βνTµν
(1)+O(∂2), (12)
where we make use of the equilibrium entropy current sµdeﬁned in Eq. ( 11). By imposing the second law of
thermodynamics, i.e., ∂µsµ
NS≥0, for Eq. ( 12), we can obtain the constitutive relations of the various dissipative
currents [ 16,20],
Π =ζθ, (13)
hµ=−κ(Duµ−β∇µT), (14)

Here, all transport coeﬃcients are positive, i.e., κ≥0,λ≥0,η≥0,ζ≥0, andγ≥0. We deﬁne /tildewideγ=βγ/2,

all the terms on the r.h.s. are of order O(∂) in hydrodynamic gradient expansion. Equations ( 14)-(17) show explicitly
thatatthislevel,the numberofstatevariables T,uµ,ωµνperfectlymatchesthenumberofdynamicalequations( 6)-(8).
Note that if λ= 0, and γ= 0, then all the dissipative currents associated with the antisymme tric part of the energy-
momentum tensor vanish. In this limit, if we consider the Landau fram e choice, i.e., hµ= 0, then nonvanishing
dissipative currents are πµν, and Π. Moreover, if we set ωµν= 0, then the spin tensor also decouples from the
theory. This is the NS limit giving rise to the standard hydrodynamics o fspinless ﬂuid. Unfortunately, this ﬁrst-
order spin hydrodynamic framework can be shown to be pathologica l as it can give rise to instabilities under linear
perturbations [ 70,71]. This is not a desired feature for a hydrodynamic theory, particula rly for phenomenological
applications.
III. TOWARDS SECOND-ORDER SPIN HYDRODYNAMICS
A. Entropy current for the second-order theory
Historically, it is also well known that even for the spinless ﬂuid, the re lativistic NS theory is ill-deﬁned because
it can contain instabilities when perturbed around an arbitrary globa l equilibrium. The relativistic NS theory is
unstable in the sense that small departures from equilibrium at one in stant of time will diverge exponentially with
time. The time scale of these instabilities can be short, which may aﬀec t the time evolution of the system [ 74,100].
We emphasize that in the comoving frame or in the rest frame, Landa u’s theory of dissipative hydrodynamics (for
spinless ﬂuid) is stable. However, the generic instability manifests its elf in a Lorentz-boosted frame. Subsequently,
it has been argued that such instabilities are intrinsically related to th e acausal nature of the NS theory [ 81]. Since
the NS equations are not intrinsically hyperbolic, they allow for pertu rbations that propagate at an inﬁnite speed.
These fundamental problems provide overwhelming motivation to pr ohibit the practical application of relativistic
NS theory. To incorporate dissipative eﬀects consistently in ﬂuid dy namics without violating causality, second-order
theories are constructed, e.g., Israel-Stewart (IS) theory, et c. The IS second-order theory contains new parameters
compared to the NS theory. Kinetic theory calculations have been u sed to show that these new parameters are
nonvanishing and if these parameters are chosen appropriately th en the dynamical equations governing the evolution
of linear perturbations form a hyperbolic system of equations. Sec ond-order dissipative hydrodynamic frameworks
for spinless ﬂuid have been argued to be free of stability and causalit y issues [ 73–81] which makes IS theory more
acceptable as a viable hydrodynamic theory. We expect that such f eatures will also remain intact for second-order
spin hydrodynamic frameworks3. Similarly to the NS theory here we also follow the entropy current an alysis to derive
the second-order spin hydrodynamic equations. In this approach once again we start with the entropy current for an
arbitrary nonequilibrium state near equilibrium [ 82],

gradient expansion. Such a term does not appear in the NS limit, see E q. (12). Novel information about new spin
dissipative currents is embedded in Sλµν
(1)(Eq. (4)). The term Qµis a general four vector containing terms up to
second order ( O(∂2)). However, the form of Qµis not completely arbitrary as it contains all second-order terms
composed of hµ,πµν, Π,qµ,φµν, andSµαβ
(1). The form of Qµis constrained by the condition that entropy is maximum
in the equilibrium state. Contracting Eq. ( 18) withuµwe immediately obtain, sIS−s=uµQµ, wheresIS≡uµsµ
IS.
The condition that sIS≤simpliesuµQµ≤0 (see Appendix Afor details). Before we introduce the most general
expression of Qµwe ﬁrst express Sµαβ
(1)in terms of irreducible tensors. Recall that the ﬁrst-order corre ction to the spin
tensor satisﬁes uµSµαβ
(1)= 0 and it is antisymmetric in the last two indices. Therefore, the most general decomposition
ofSµαβ
(1)in terms of irreducible tensors takes the form [ 101] (see Appendix B),
Sµαβ
(1)= 2u[α∆µβ]Φ+2u[ατµβ]

extensive investigation which we will address in future wor ks.7

We deﬁne ai,˜ai,bi,˜bi,andcito be dimensionful coeﬃcients. While it is clear that due to u·Q≤0 thea(˜a) coeﬃcients
have deﬁnite signatures with a1≤0,a2≤0,a3≥0,a4≥0,a5≤0, ˜a1≤0, ˜a2≤0, ˜a3≤0, ˜a4≥0, there are no such
sign constraints on bi,˜bi, orci. Although a kinetic theory approach may indicate the sign of these c oeﬃcients.
B. Evolution equations
We argued that for the NS theory the dissipative currents hµ,qµ,πµν, Π, and φµνcan be expressed in terms of
fundamental hydrodynamic variables T,uµ, andωµν. This conclusion is obtained using the condition ∂µsµ
NS≥0. But
for the second-order theory, various dissipative currents are c onsidered independent variables. This is evident from
the fact that we have constructed second-order terms in sµ
ISin terms of these dissipative currents. Therefore, to close
the hydrodynamic equations, we also need the evolution equation fo r these dissipative currents, which can be obtained
using the condition that ∂µsµ
IS≥0. Taking the divergence of sµ
ISand using spin-hydrodynamic equations, it can be
shown that (see Appendix Cfor details),

Notice that for the global equilibrium condition Sµαβ
(1)= 0,Qµ= 0. Moreover, ∂µsµ
IS= 0 implies the most general
global equilibrium conditions ( 10), i.e., the spin chemical potential converges to thermal vorticity, i.e.,ωµν→T

In the above equations, scalars DandF, vectors AβandBβ, and tensors Cµν,Eµν,Gµν,Hµν, andIµνδare deﬁned
in Appendix E. Note that the dissipative ﬂuxes multiplying these quantities satisfy the following properties: hµand
qµare orthogonal to uµ,πµνandτµν

Hereχ1,χ2,χ2,andχ4are new spin-transport coeﬃcients4. Using Eqs. ( 33)-(41), in Eq. ( 32) we obtain the following
4It is worth mentioning that expressions similar to the ﬁrst t erms appearing on the right-hand side in Eqs. ( 38)-(41) were also obtained
using the ﬁrst-order spin hydrodynamic approach consideri ng the spin chemical potential leading order ( O(1)) in hydrodynamic gradient
expansion [ 19]. However, such formalism [ 19], is intrinsically diﬀerent from our approach of formulati ng the ﬁrst-order spin hydrodynam-
ics [20,70,72] as we consider ωµν∼ O(∂). In our formalism, the derivative corrections to the spin t ensor Eqs. ( 38)-(41) don’t contribute
to the Navier-Stokes theory. This is one of the novel feature s of our spin hydrodynamic theory, where the nontrivial cont ribution of the
dissipative parts of the spin tensor starts to contribute to the entropy current at the second order and beyond. Finally t o avoid any
confusion, Eqs. ( 38)-(41) are dynamical equations, i.e, they contain the currents an d their spacetime derivatives. Therefore, one should
not get confused with the naive gradient counting at this lev el where all terms of Eqs. ( 38)-(41) are not of second-order in gradients. As
we will see later, this feature will allow us to recover the Na iver-Stokes spin-hydrodynamic equations [ 20,70,72].9

This immediately implies that κ≥0,λ≥0,η≥0,ζ≥0γ≥0,χ1≥0,χ2≥0,χ3≥0, andχ4≥0. We
emphasize that the presence of D,A/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright,B/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright,C/angbracketleftµν/angbracketrightandE/angbracketleft[µν]/angbracketrightin Eqs. ( 33)-(37) shows that for the second order
theory the constitutive relations of Π, hµ,qµ,πµνandφµνare not simply expressed by Eqs. ( 14)-(17) in terms of
basic hydrodynamic variables, T,uµandωµν. Therefore in the second order theory Π, hµ,qµ,πµνandφµνshould
be considered as independent hydrodynamic variables along with T,uµandωµν. The evolution equation of new
hydrodynamic variables can be obtained from Eqs. ( 33)-(37). Using explicit expressions of D,A/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright,B/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright,C/angbracketleftµν/angbracketrightand
E/angbracketleft[µν]/angbracketrightwe can write the evolution equations of diﬀerent dissipative current s as,

relaxationtimes can be identiﬁed as, τΦ=−2˜a1χ1≥0,ττs≡ −2˜a2χ2≥0,ττa≡ −2˜a3χ3≥0, andτΘ≡2˜a4χ4≥0. In
comparisonto the ﬁrst-orderspin hydrodynamics, one of the mos t important features of the second-ordertheory is the
presenceofrelaxationtimes correspondingto variousthe dissipat ivecurrents. The time scaleswithin which dissipative
currents respond to hydrodynamic gradients are represented b y these relaxation times. These relaxation times are
expected to make the second-order theory free from any proble ms appearing from acausality and hydrodynamic
instability. However, such an important feature of the second-or der theory comes at a price. With respect to the
ﬁrst-order theory, there are more parameters or transport c oeﬃcients in the second-order theory. Although Eqs. ( 43)-
(47) and Eqs. ( 48)-(51) are all relaxation type equations, but there is a striking diﬀerence between these equations.
Note that Eqs. ( 43)-(47) contain terms of O(∂) andO(∂2) on both sides. But this is not true for Eqs. ( 48)-(51).
The right hand sides of Eqs. ( 48)-(51) does not contain terms of the order O(∂). This is because the dissipative
parts of the spin tensor do not contribute to the entropy curren t analysis at the Navier-Stokes limit where all the
dissipative currents are expressed as O(∂) terms. To check the consistency of the formalism, it is natural to look for11
the Navier-Stokes limit of the second-order theory. This can be ac hieved by ignoring all second-order terms in the
hydrodynamic gradient expansion in Eqs. ( 43)-(51). In this limit, we retrieve back the constitutive relation of various
dissipative currents associated with the energy-momentum tenso r, e.g., from Eq. ( 43) we ﬁnd, after ignoring all O(∂2)
terms,
Π =−τΠ
2a1βθ=ζθ. (52)
Similarly constitutive relations for hµ,qµ,πµν,φµνcan be obtained from Eqs. ( 44), (45), (46), and (47) respectively.
These expressions will match Eqs. ( 14)-(17). However if we ignore all O(∂2) terms in Eqs. ( 48)-(51) then we observe
that Φ = 0+ O(∂2),τµν
(s)= 0+O(∂2),τµν
(a)= 0 +O(∂2), Θαµν= 0+O(∂2). This immediately implies that at the
Navier-Stokes limit gradient correction terms to the spin tensor do not contribute to the entropy production, and
Sαµν
(1)can only be obtained for the second order theory.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
In this paper, we show a new derivation of the second-order dissipa tive spin hydrodynamic equations. This formu-
lation is based on the positivity of the entropy production for a dissip ative system. We consider an energy-momentum
tensor which is asymmetric and the spin tensor has a simple phenomen ological form where it is only anti-symmetric
in the last two indices. One can retrieve the correct Navier-Stokes limit as well as global equilibrium conditions. Our
calculations can be used to study macroscopic spin evolution and pos sibly it will help us to solve the puzzle related
to the longitudinal polarization of Lambda particles in a dynamical way . But this requires a proper numerical im-
plementation of spin hydrodynamic equations along with appropriate initial conditions and hadronic freezeout. One
immediate future task would be to study the stability and causality an alysis to pin down the region of applicability
of this theory. Although we have obtained relaxation time like hydrod ynamic equations it lacks a proper understand-
ing of the microscopic theory. This is manifested in large numbers of u nknown transport coeﬃcients and relaxation
times. Note that a dissipative hydrodynamic theory captures the lo ng wavelength and long-time behavior of a system
away from equilibrium. On the other hand transport coeﬃcients enc odes the microscopic physics at a length scale
smaller than the domain of applicability of hydrodynamics. The estimat ion of various relaxation times and transport
coeﬃcients is very important for phenomenological applications. On ly a bottom-up approach to spin-hydrodynamic
where one obtains a spin-hydrodynamic equation using a kinetic theo ry approach can bridge this problem. Finding
an equivalent kinetic theory approach without further assumption s will be a good direction to explore as a future
task.

Appendix A: Constraint on the form of Qµ
Contracting the second-order entropy current ( 18) with the ﬂuid four-velocity, and using the fact that uµSµαβ
(1)= 0,
we get
uµsµ
IS=uµsµ
NS+uµQµ. (A1)
Substituting the form of sµ
NS(12) in the above equation, we have
uµsµ
IS=uµ/bracketleftBig
sµ+βνTµν
(1)+O(∂2)/bracketrightBig
+uµQµ,
=uµsµ+uµQµ. (A2)
Utilizing the perfect-ﬂuid energy-momentum tensor ( 5), and replacing the form of the entropy current sµ(11) we ﬁnd,
uµsµ
IS=uµ/parenleftBig

+uµQµ,
=β/bracketleftbig
(ε+p)−ωαβSαβ/bracketrightbig
+uµQµ. (A3)12
Finally, using the generalized ﬁrst law of thermodynamics ( 9), we obtain
uµsµ
IS=s+uµQµ. (A4)
Employing the fact that entropy is maximum in equilibrium, we obtain the constraint on Qµ, i.e,
uµQµ≤0. (A5)
Appendix B: Decomposition of an arbitrary 3-rank tensor ant isymmetric in last two indices
Let us consideran arbitrarythree-ranktensor φλµνantisymmetricin last two indices. Employingthe decomposition
of its ﬁrst index into the parts transverse and parallel to four-ve locity, one has
φλµν=gλ
αφαµν= (uλuα+∆λ
α)φαµν
=uλγµν+∆λ
αφαµν
=uλγµν+φ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketrightµν(B1)
Here we deﬁne antisymmetric tensor γµν≡uαφαµν. This immediately implies that Fν≡uµγµνsatisﬁesF·u= 0.
In the next step, we proceed with the decomposition of γµν
γµν=gµ
ργρν= (uµuρ+∆µ
ρ)γρν=uµFν+γ/angbracketleftµ/angbracketrightν
=uµFν+gν
ργ/angbracketleftµ/angbracketrightρ=uµFν+(uνuρ+∆ν
ρ)γ/angbracketleftµ/angbracketrightρ
=uµFν+uνuργ/angbracketleftµ/angbracketrightρ+γ/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright/angbracketleftν/angbracketright(B2)
It can be easily shown that uνuργ/angbracketleftµ/angbracketrightρ=−uνFµ. Therefore, γµνhas the form,
γµν=uµFν−uνFµ+γ/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright/angbracketleftν/angbracketright. (B3)
Now, let us consider the last term in Eq. ( B1),
φ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketrightµν=gµ
ρφ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketrightρν= (uµuρ+∆µ
ρ)φ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketrightρν=uµuρφ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketrightρν+φ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketright/angbracketleftµ/angbracketrightν(B4)
Deﬁning uρφ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketrightρν≡ −Σλν, implies uλΣλν= 0. Therefore,
φ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketrightµν=φ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketright/angbracketleftµ/angbracketrightν−uµΣλν
=gν
αφ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketright/angbracketleftµ/angbracketrightα−uµΣλν
=φ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketright/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright/angbracketleftν/angbracketright+uνuαφ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketright/angbracketleftµ/angbracketrightα−uµΣλν
=φ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketright/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright/angbracketleftν/angbracketright+uνΣλµ−uµΣλν. (B5)
Using Eqs. ( B2) and (B5) in Eq. ( B1) we obtain,
φλµν=uλ/parenleftBig
uµFν−uνFµ+γ/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright/angbracketleftν/angbracketright/parenrightBig
+uνΣλµ−uµΣλν+φ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketright/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright/angbracketleftν/angbracketright. (B6)
Here we can introduce Sµν≡uµFν−uνFµ+γ/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright/angbracketleftν/angbracketright. Noticing that Sµνis an antisymmetric tensor that can also
be decomposed as Sµν≡uµκν−uνκµ+ǫµναβuαωβ, withu·κ= 0 and u·ω= 0, we identify Fν=κν, and
γ/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright/angbracketleftν/angbracketright≡ǫµναβuαωβ[102]. Since Σµνis asymmetric (not antisymmetric!) and orthogonal to uµit can also be
decomposed into symmetric (Σµν
(s)) and antisymmetric (Σµν
(a)) parts. The symmetric part can be further decomposed
into a trace (Σ) and a traceless part (Σ/angbracketleftµν/angbracketright
s). Finally, we obtain the following expression,
φλµν=uλSµν+/parenleftbig
uν∆λµ−uµ∆λν/parenrightbig
Σ+/parenleftBig
uνΣ/angbracketleftλµ/angbracketright
(s)−uµΣ/angbracketleftλν/angbracketright

uνΣλµ
(a)−uµΣλν
(a)/parenrightBig
+φ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketright/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright/angbracketleftν/angbracketright.(B7)
One may check that the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) matc hes for the quantities on both sides of the above
equation. The tensor φλµνhas in total 24 DOF. At the same time, Sµνhas 6 DOF, and Σ is a scalar, hence it has
only one DOF. Σ/angbracketleftµν/angbracketright
(s)is symmetric, traceless, and orthogonal to the ﬂuid ﬂow vector, h ence it has 5 DOF, while Σµν
(a)
is antisymmetric and transverse to the ﬂuid ﬂow, hence it has 3 DOF. Finally,φ/angbracketleftλ/angbracketright/angbracketleftµ/angbracketright/angbracketleftν/angbracketrightis antisymmetric in the last
two indices and orthogonal to ﬂow vector in all indices, hence it has o nly 9 DOF.13

Appendix E: Explicit expressions for D,Aµ,Bµ,Cµν,Eµν,F,Gµν,Hµν, andIαµν
The ﬁrst step in deriving the following scalars, vectors, and tensor s starts by taking the partial derivative of Qµ
in Eq. (20). Note that the partial derivative of the parameters ai,˜ai,bi,˜bi,andciis not zero. The next step is to
collect all terms having common dissipative current. In such a proce ss, one can encounter terms of two diﬀerent
dissipative currents, for example, ‘ πµνhν∇µb2’. For that, we’ve introduced the constants land˜lsuch that
πµνhν∇µb2=lhππµνhν∇µb2+(1−lhπ)πµνhν∇µb2 (E1)
