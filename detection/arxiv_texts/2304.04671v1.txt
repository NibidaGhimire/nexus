This article suggests that Bose-Einstein condensation can occur without the need for an energy
barrier when the boundary conditions are set asT
Tc=z(where z is a positive integer). Under these
conditions, bosons can condense in the Schwarzschild black hole. The incident waves can then be
trapped and condensed within the black hole, generating a po tential barrier near the event horizon.
This suggests that Schwarzschild black holes under f(R) Gra vity can also exhibit superradiance,
which raises the possibility of violating the cosmic censor ship conjecture. It should be noted that
the natural unit system is used in this article.

1. INTRODUCTION
In 2000, Parikh and Wilczek proposed a method to calculate the emiss ivity of particles passing through the event
horizon, treating Hawking radiation as a tunneling process using the WKB method. Their results, which give a
correction spectrum accurate to a ﬁrst-order approximation, a re considered consistent with the basic Maldacena
conjecture. Numerous stationary or stationary rotating black h oles have been studied using this method, yielding
the same result: Hawking radiation is no longer pure thermal radiatio n, thus satisfying the Universe Theory and the
conservation of information. However, all of these studies only co nsider the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black
holes. If quantum corrections to the entropy are taken into acco unt, does the emission process still conform to the
monolithic theory? At present, diﬀerent models and methods have le d to diﬀerent results in this regard.
Gas, liquid, and solid are the three basic forms of matter well known t o people. Water molecules, for instance,
can exist as ice, water, and water vapor as the temperature chan ges. As scientists continued to investigate, they
discovered that when the temperature of matter is raised to a cer tain point, a plasma state will appear. An intriguing
question is what happens to matter when it is cooled down to close to a bsolute zero (-273.16 °C). Under such extreme
temperatures, what kind of peculiar state does matter take on? I n fact, as early as 1924, the renowned physicists Bose
and Einstein answered this question. Particles with integer spins, su ch as photons, gluons, nuclei composed of an even
number of nucleons, and alkali metal atoms, are called bosons. At t hat time, the Indian physicist Bose proposed a
new method of photon statistics. Einstein then extended it to an ide al gas with mass and theoretically predicted that
when there is no interaction among bosons, they will reach their lowe st value at a certain temperature. The quantum
energy state suddenly condenses, and when it reaches a signiﬁcan t amount, it becomes a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC).
This ampliﬁcation eﬀect can be very strong, leading to the formation of an exponentially growing wave. This eﬀect
is called the classical superradiance instability. In the presence of a reﬂective mirror outside the black hole, this eﬀect
can be even stronger, leading to the formation of a ”black hole bomb .” The Kerr-black hole-scalar ﬁeld mirror system
is an example of such a system. The mirror reﬂects the waves back t owards the black hole, amplifying them and
causing them to bounce back and forth between the mirror and the black hole, leading to the formation of a highly
energetic state. The stability of this system depends on the balanc e between the ampliﬁcation due to superradiance
and the loss of energy due to absorption by the black hole. The stud y of black hole bombs and superradiance eﬀects
is an active area of research in theoretical physics.
If the boundary conditions are preset, the boundary conditionsT
Tc=z(when z is plural),the eﬀective action form
satisﬁes the eﬀective action form of Hawking radiation, and is not ne cessarily at the boundary of event horizon. The
general formulation of the black hole temperature is[4](At that time there was a special solution)

condensationwithout an energylayer. Under Bose condensation, the incident wavemay condensein the Schwarzschild
black hole. At that time, the Schwarzschild black hole event horizon P otential barriers can be generated nearby, and
we think that Schwarzschild black holes can also generate superrad iation phenomena(This article uses the natural
unit system).This implies that the cosmic censorship conjecture may be violated.
2. THE SUPERRADIATION EFFECT AND UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE
We ﬁnd the Klein-Gordon equation[10]
Φ;µ
;µ= 0, (2)
where we deﬁned Φ ;µ≡(∂µ−ieAµ)Φ andeis the charge of the scalar ﬁeld.We get Aµ={A0(x),0},andeA0(x)can
be equal to µ(whereµis the mass).
A0→/braceleftbigg
0 asx→ −∞
Vasx→+∞. (3)
With Φ =e−iωtf(x), which is determined by the ordinary diﬀerential equation
d2f
dx2+(ω−eA0)2f= 0. (4)
We see that particles coming from −∞and scattering oﬀ the potential with reﬂection and transmission am plitudes
RandTrespectively. With these boundary conditions, the solution to beha ves asymptotically as
fin(x) =Ieiωx+Re−iωx,x→ −∞, (5)
fin(x) =Teikx,x→+∞ (6)
wherek=±(ω−eV).
To deﬁne the sign of ωandkwe must look at the wave’s group velocity. We require ∂ω/∂k> 0, so that they travel
from the left to the right in the x–direction and we take ω>0.
The reﬂection coeﬃcient and transmission coeﬃcient depend on the speciﬁc shape of the potential A0. However
one can easily show that the Wronskian
W=˜f1d˜f2
dx−˜f2d˜f1
dx, (7)
between two independent solutions, ˜f1and˜f2, of is conserved. From the equation on the other hand, if fis a solution
then its complex conjugate f∗is another linearly independent solution. We ﬁnd |R|2=|I|2−ω−eV
ω|T |2.Thus,for
0<ω <eV ,it is possible to have superradiant ampliﬁcation of the reﬂected curr ent, i.e,|R|>|I|. There are other
potentials that can be completely resolved, which can also show supe rradiation explicitly.

The reﬂection coeﬃcient and transmission coeﬃcient depend on the speciﬁc shape of the potential V.We show that

|A|2−|B|2/parenrightbig
.Thus,forωH/ω∞<0,it is possible to have superradiant ampliﬁcation of the reﬂected cur rent, i.e,if
|A|= 0,|C|>|D|. There are other potentials that can be completely resolved, which can also show superradiation
explicitly.
The principle of joint uncertainty states that the joint measureme nt of position and momentum is impossible,
meaning that the simultaneous measurement of position and moment um can only be an approximate joint mea-
surement, and the error follows the inequality ∆ x∆p≥1/2 (in the natural unit system). By using the expression
|R|2=|I|2−ω−eV
ω|T |2, we can see that |R|2≥ −ω−eV
ω|T |2is a necessary condition for the inequality ∆ x∆p≥1/2
to hold.
We can predeﬁne the boundary conditions as eA0(x) =yω(which can also be expressed as µ=yω). Whenyis
relatively large (which can be the case for bosons with certain prope rties),|R|2≥ −ω−eV
ω|T |2may not hold. As a
result, ∆x∆p≥1/2 may not hold, and the classical superradiation eﬀect in the spacet ime of a steady black hole may
not obey the generalized uncertainty principle. The same applies to r everse inference.
3. UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE CORRECTION UNDER SIMULATED F(R) G RAVITY
We can predeﬁne the boundary conditions as eA0(x) =−yω(which can also be expressed as µ=yω). When the
boundary conditions of the incident boson are pre-set, the proba bility ﬂow density equation becomes unequal on both
sides due to the boundary conditions, leading to a certain probability . This also explains why the no-hair theorem
is invalid in quantum eﬀects. As mentioned in the previous literature [1 0], the superradiation eﬀect is a process of
entropy subtraction.
Furthermore, we explore the spherical quantum solution in a vacuu m state.
In this theory, the general relativity theory’s ﬁeld equation is writt en completely.

The principle of joint uncertainty showsthat it is impossible to make jo int measurement of position and momentum,
that is, to measure position and momentum simultaneously, only appr oximate joint measurement can be made, and
the error follows the inequality ∆ x∆p≥1/2(in natural unit system).We ﬁnd |R|2=|I|2−ω−eV
ω|T |2,and we know
that|R|2≥ −ω−eV
ω|T |2is a necessary condition for the inequality ∆ x∆p≥1/2 to be established.We can pre-set the
boundary conditions eA0(x) =yω[13]and we see that when yis relatively large(according to the properties of the
boson,ycan be very large), |R|2≥ −ω−eV
ω|T |2may not hold.In the end,we can get ∆ x∆p≥1/2 may not hold.When
the boundary conditions are assumed and part of the wave functio n is decoupled, the classical form of the probability
function is obtained, and the boundary conditions can be clearly sub stituted into the uncertainty principle expression,
we get a lower uncertainty principle limit. To say the least, because of the limitation of the uncertainty principle,
there is a limitation on the value of y, whereas in the literature above, the extreme value of uncertainty principle can
be smaller, and the range of the value of y in turn is larger.5

The concept of entropy was proposed by the German physicist Clau sius in 1865. Kjeldahl deﬁnes the increase and
decrease of entropy in a thermodynamic system: the total amoun t of heat used at a constant temperature in a
reversible process, and can be expressed as:

Since the algebra of real quaternions is the only fourdimensional div ision algebra, we introduce the fourdimensional
quaternion manifold[2]. When the boundary conditions are preset, w ith the evolution process, a stable pull equation
is formed, and a quaternion time variable can be created for a short time,

5. SCHWARZSCHILD BLACK HOLE PRODUCE SUPER-RADIATION PHENO MENA
According to traditional theory, the Schwarzschild black hole does not produce superradiation. If the boundary
conditions are set in advance, the possibility is combined with the wave function of the coupling of the boson in the
Schwarzschild black hole, and the mass of the incident boson acts as a mirror, so even if the Schwarzschild black hole
can also produce super-radiation phenomena.
Schr¨ odinger’s equation for the motion of a particle in a centrally sym metric ﬁeld is
∆ψ+(2m/(/planckover2pi1)2)(E−U(r))ψ= 0. (39)6
Let us consider the following radial equation:
1
r2d
dr(r2dR
dr)−l(l+1)
r2R+2m
/planckover2pi12(E−U(r))R= 0. (40)
By the substitution
R(r) =X(r)/r (41)
d2X
dr2+[2m
/planckover2pi12(E−U(r))−l(l+1)
r2]X= 0. (42)
For S-wave, l= 0, the equation of X(r) is
d2X
dr2+2m
/planckover2pi12(E−U(r))X= 0. (43)
Note that, in the Parikh-Wilczek (solid basic structure on which bigge r things can be built), to calculate the self-
gravitation reliably the tunnelling particle is carefully thought about/ believed as a spherical shell (S-wave). In this
way, when it gives oﬀ from the black hole the matter-gravity system transits from one spherical state to another. So,
the de-Broglie wave function of the emission spherical shell should b e
ψ(r) =X(r)/r. (44)
That is, the WKB wave function of a particle can be written as
ψ(r) =X(r)/r=1
rexp[iT
/planckover2pi1], (45)
where
T(r) =T0(r)+(/planckover2pi1
i)T1(r)+(/planckover2pi1

wherevis the speed of the tunnelling particle. In area II, the WKB wave func tion is a linear combination of real
(increasing more and more as time goes on)s. (thinking about/when one thinks about) the connection between the
swinging back and forth and the (increasing more and more as time go es on) solutions at r=a, the WKB wave

Let’s now calculate the phase space factor corresponding to the b lack hole tunnelling. For Schwarzschild black hole,
the line element in Painlev´ e coordinates is
ds2=−c2(1−2MG
c2r)dt2+2c/radicalbigg
2MG
c2rdtdr+dr2+r2(dθ2+sin2θdφ2), (54)
and the radial null geodesics are
˙r=dr
dt=±c(1−/radicalbigg
2MG
c2r). (55)
The massive quanta doesn’t follow radial-lightlike geodesics (55). We t reat the massive particle as a de Broglie
wave and obtain the expression of.r. Namely,
.r=vp=1
2vg=−1
2g00
g01=1
2rc2r2−2MGr√

Note that to calculate the emission rate correctly, we should take in to account the self-gravitation of the tunnelling
particle with energy ω.

We see that under the background of the Schwarzschild black hole, its thermodynamic temperature evolves into a
constant. At that time, there is a potential barrier near the horiz on. We know that the Schwarzschild black hole can
be superradiation at that time(At that time there was a special solu tion).

Furthermore, if the existence of a naked singularity is ruled out, th en the universe will be deterministic, and its
evolution can be inferred solely based on its state at a particular mom ent (speciﬁcally, a space-like three-dimensional
hypersurface known as the Cauchy surface), excluding the limited space hidden in the horizon of the singular point.
However, if the cosmological censorship hypothesis fails, then it will result in the failure of the universe’s deﬁniteness
as it will be impossible to derive the space-time behavior of the univers e from the causality of the singular point. The
cosmic censorship hypothesis is a formal concern of the physics co mmunity, and when referring to the event horizon of
a black hole, some form of cosmological censorship hypothesis is alwa ys involved. Recently, a study[15] demonstrated
that the entropy of a black hole could decrease under superradiat ion, which suggests a possible violation of the cosmic
censorship conjecture.10
7. SUMMARY
This article proposes a method to construct the entropy of a syst em with a complex temperature ratio, resulting
in a ring structure of an algebraic system with the entropy and time d imension in the same direction. When applied
to the background of the Schwarzschild black hole, the thermodyn amic temperature becomes constant and potential
barriers form near the horizon. This suggests that the Schwarzs child black hole can exhibit superradiation in f(R)
gravity, which could potentially violate the cosmic censorship conjec ture.
