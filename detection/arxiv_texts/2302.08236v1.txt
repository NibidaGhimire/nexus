Quantum sensing is considered to be one of the most promising subﬁelds of quantum information to deliver
practical quantum advantages in real-world applications. However, its impressive capabilities, including high
sensitivity, are often hindered by the limited quantum resources available. Here, we incorporate the expected
information gain (EIG) and techniques such as accelerated computation into Bayesian experimental design
(BED) in order to use quantum resources more efﬁciently. A simulated nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond is
used to demonstrate real-time operation of the BED. Instead of heuristics, the EIG is used to choose optimal
control parameters in real-time. Moreover, combining the BED with accelerated computation and asynchronous
operations, we ﬁnd that up to a tenfold speed-up in absolute time cost can be achieved in sensing multiple
surrounding13C nuclear spins. Our work explores the possibilities of applying the EIG to BED-based quantum-
sensing tasks and provides techniques useful to integrate BED into more generalized quantum sensing systems.
I. INTRODUCTION
Quantum sensing, based on unique phenomena like quan-
tum entanglement [1, 2], quantum coherence [3] and quantum
spin magnetometry [4], is used to measure physical quanti-
ties such as the electromagnetic [4, 5] and gravitational ﬁeld
[2]. Compared to classical schemes, quantum sensing ex-
hibits multiple advantages, such as a sensitivity exceeding the
standard quantum limit [1, 2, 6–8] and a microscopic spatial
resolution [4, 5]. However, it is well known that the quan-
tum resources quantum sensors rely on are limited due to un-
wanted effects [9]. This, in turn, has encouraged a plethora
of efforts, such as the improvement of experimental appa-
ratus [10], the usage of dynamical decoupling [11–14] and
quantum heterodyne magnetometry [15], to enhance the ro-
bustness of the quantum sensors. Moreover, methods based on
machine learning have recently gained increasing attention.
Beneﬁting from specialized hardware [16], ever-growing
software support [17], and hyper-scale deep-learning mod-
els [18], machine learning is the building block of various
recent breakthroughs in technology, such as artiﬁcial intelli-
gence [19], natural language processing [20], and computer
vision [21]. It is, therefore, not surprising that it also provides
diverse applications in the ﬁeld of quantum physics [22–25]
due to its high expressivity [26, 27]. In particular, as a re-
markable example of machine learning, Bayesian experimen-
tal designs (BED) have been employed, among others, in pro-
cessing the noisy readout of solid-state spins [28] and recon-
structing unknown quantum state of photonic systems [29].
On the other hand, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center
spin in diamond, as an extremely well controllable ambient-
condition quantum system, has been studied extensively in
lidongxiao414@hust.edu.cnbio-imaging [30–32], micro-scale magnetometry [4, 15], and
nuclear magnetic resonance [33–35] due to its ﬂuorescence
brightness, good optical stability, high sensitivity to external
magnetic ﬁelds, as well as low toxicity [9, 15, 36], and is
likewise a suitable platform to demonstrate frameworks not
limited to quantum sensing [37–44]. Notably, based on BED
and NV centers, an increasing amount of frontier work has
been put forward, such as static magnetic ﬁeld magnetome-
try [28, 45], quantum Hamiltonian learning [46, 47], and un-
known quantum system learning [43]. However, for more
general quantum systems, conducting BED in real-time re-
mains unexplored owing to the high demand of simulation re-
sources and the lack of universally efﬁcient heuristics. Heuris-
tics that work well in one quantum sensing task could end up
with sub-optimal results when employed in a similar, albeit
different, setup. Besides, while it is well perceived that reduc-
ing the computational overhead in BED can free researchers
from using more complex optimization process, the efforts
spent in exploring this path are limited.
In this work, we apply real-time BED on a simulated sin-
gle NV-center spin interacting with a more generalized en-
vironment, such as multiple nearby nuclear spins and os-
cillating magnetic ﬁelds. To avoid the difﬁculty of ﬁnd-
ing suitable heuristics, we employ the expected information
gain (EIG) [48–51] as the utility function to obtain a system-
agnostic guidance, which allows to optimize the experimen-
tal parameters efﬁciently. Moreover, the number of single-
shot measurements required for the same uncertainty is re-
duced by a full order of magnitude, compared to non-adaptive
protocols [52]. In addition, by virtue of a single consumer-
grade general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU),
the lengthy simulation time during real-time adaptive exper-
iments can be substantially decreased in order to fulﬁll ex-
perimental requirements [28, 52]. To further reduce the time
overhead induced by the adaptive design, we introduce asyn-arXiv:2302.08236v1  [quant-ph]  16 Feb 20232
chronous operation into the BED. Combining the accelerated
computation and the asynchronous operation, we can trans-
late the reduction in number of single-shot measurements into
a speed-up in absolute time cost.
The article is organized as follows. We begin by intro-
ducing our BED scheme including the EIG in Sec. II. In
Sec. III A, we then simulate some experiments to detect in-
dividual nuclear spins coupled to an NV center electron spin.
We further test the protocol for the detection of oscillating
magnetic ﬁelds using NV center as a magnetic sensor in
Sec. III B. In Sec. IV, the efforts in reducing the computational
overhead are discussed. Finally, we summarize our work in
Sec. V.
II. BAYESIAN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Rigorous extensions of the concepts in BED have appeared
in Refs. [50, 53, 54]. In our BED treatment, without loss of
generality, we consider a two-level probe, initially prepared in
the statej0i, whose population in the basis states fj0i,j1ig
can be read [9]. The Hamiltonian of the system is denoted
by^H(x)with a set of parameters x= (x1;:::;xn)which are
being estimated [55]. In order to estimate xaccurately, repeti-
tive measurements are required. In an experiment, these repe-
titions are treated as a series of events E= (e1;:::;em). The
control parameters and the read-out result of the ith single-
shot eventeiare written as cianddi, respectively. The control
parametersci, which can, in principle, characterize any quan-
tity that can be controlled and adjusted in the experiment, can
be chosen fromC=fc1;:::; cpg.
According to the Bayes’ theorem [56], we can construct the
probability distribution of xfrom a sequence of single-shot
measurements, i.e.,
Pr(xjD)/mY
i=1Pr(dijx;ci)Pr0(x); (1)
whereD= (d1;:::;dm)represents sequential experiment
data, Pr 0(x)is the prior distribution of x, and Pr (dijx;ci)
is the likelihood function [57, 58] for our experiment. The
probability that the state of the qubit probe of the experiment,
denoted byji, remains in the initial state j0iis given by
Pr(ji=j0i) =jh0j^U(x;ci)j0ij2, where ^U(x;ci)represents
the time-evolution operator during the ith run of the experi-
ment, where the evolution time itself is also included in the
control parameter ciof the run. For an ideal read-out detec-
tion, the likelihood function is
Prideal(dijx;ci) =jhdij^U(x;ci)jdiij2; (2)
wheredi2 f0;1gis the outcome of the ith single-shot
measurement. However, inefﬁciency and noise in measure-
ments are inevitable. Therefore, the likelihood function can
be rewritten as
Pr(0jx;ci) = (p0+p1 1)Prideal(0jx;ci) + (1 p1);(3)
Pr(1jx;ci) = 1 Pr(0jx;ci); (4)wherep0andp1represent the probabilities of a faithful de-
tection ofj0iandj1i, viz.,p0=Pr(d= 0jji=j0i)and
p1=Pr(d= 1jji=j1i). In order to improve the efﬁciency
of our experiment, it is necessary to optimally choose the con-
trol parameter ciin terms of a utility function [50]. Explicitly,
the EIG EDist KLis chosen as this utility function since it is
able to achieve D-optimal designs [48] without ﬁnding spe-
ciﬁc heuristics for different models, even though the use of
EIG does require efﬁcient numerical realization to be suitable
for non-trivial models [51]. For an optimal ci, it corresponds
to the maxima of the EIG based on the previous measurements
D0= (d1;:::;di 1), i.e.,ci=argmaxc2CEDist KL(c;D0). In
our setting, the EIG can be written as
EDist KL(c;D0) = Pr(1jD0;c)Z
Pr(xjD0) log[ Pr(1jx;c)]dx
 [1 Pr(1jD0;c)]Z
Pr(xjD0) log[1 Pr(1jx;c)]dx;(5)
where Pr (1jD0;c) =R
Pr(1jx;c)Pr(xjD0)dxis the predicted
probability [53] of detecting the state j1ibased on the col-
lected intermediate results.
In summary, our real-time BED can be realized in the fol-
lowing steps: (i) Initially, we designate a suitable prior dis-
tribution Pr 0(x)to conduct the iterative measurements. (ii)
For each iteration eiinE, the optimal control parameter ci
is found via the EIG. (iii) With this optimized control param-
eter, we carry out the measurement and obtain the result di,
which can be further used to update the probability distribu-
tion Pr (xjD). (iv) Once our criteria are met, we stop the iter-
ation and conclude the results. In detail, during this whole
process, the numerical calculations necessary for the BED
are realized by employing the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
method [51, 59] and the simulations of the experiments are
performed using QuTiP [60].
III. APPLICATIONS OF THE BAYESIAN
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
A. NV center weakly coupled to nuclear spins
For the sake of providing evidence of the feasibility of our
scheme, we consider the application to a speciﬁc physical sys-
tem, namely a single NV-center spin in diamond as a sensing
probe. By applying an external magnetic ﬁeld, one can lift the
degeneracy of the spin states ms=1of the ground-state
manifold and encode the probe-qubit basis fj0i,j1igin the
two sublevels ms= 0; 1. The entire system then consists of
this probe and multiple13C nuclear spins [52] in the vicinity of
the NV center. We consider the Larmor frequency of all these
nuclear spins to be !L=2= 429:4kHz and neglect the weak
interactions between different nuclear spins. Due to the oscil-
lating nature of the signal produced by the hyperﬁne interac-
tions, we adopt a quantum lock-in ampliﬁer protocol [52, 61].
Furthermore, we assume that the coherence time of the probe
qubit is extended to the value T2by employing an XY8-4
dynamical-decoupling sequence [62]. To take the residual de-
coherence due to environmental effects into account, in our3

ics. The resulting time evolution of the system density opera-
tor^is thereby described by ^(t) = exp(Lt)^(0), where the

where ^and^q(=x;y;z )denote the Pauli operators for
the qubit probe and the qth nuclear spin, respectively. In this
system, the magnitudes !h= (!h1;:::;! hnC)and the angles= (1;:::;nC)of the hyperﬁne interaction between the
NV-center electron spin and the nuclear spins are the param-
eters to be estimated. This means for the present scenario we
havex= (!h;). On the other hand, the control parameter
of the experiment is which corresponds to the free evolu-
tion time 2between the decoupling pulses (for details see
Appendix A).
In terms of the incoherent time evolution generated by
Eq. (6) and the dynamical-decoupling sequence XY8-4 [62]
with a total evolution time of 64, when assuming instanta-
neous pulses, the expression jh0j^U(x;ci)j0ij2is replaced by
h0j[exp(64Li)j0ih0j]j0i, where we keep in mind that the gen-
eratorLdepends on the parameters (!h;). The likelihood
function (3) of a single-shot measurement event can thereby4
be derived and has the form

According to the SMC method, a probability distribution
can be represented by a set of npparticles [59, 63]. Utilizing
such a method combined with Eq. (1), one obtains
Pr((!h;)jD)npX
k=1wk((!h;) (!hk;k)); (12)
in whichwk, fulﬁllingPnp
kwk= 1, and (!hk;k)are the
weight and location of the kth particle, respectively. Com-
bined with Eq. (5), the EIG can thereby be written as
EDist KL(;D0) = 

Furthermore, by virtue of Eq. (13) and Eq. (1), for the ith run
of the experiment, we can ﬁlter the optimal control parame-
teri=argmaxEDist KL(;D0)to accumulate measurement
eventsEand obtain the posterior distribution Pr ((!h;)jD).
Finally, the average of the parameters (!h;)can be calcu-
lated according to !h=Pnp
k=1wk!hkand=Pnp
k=1wkk.
The corresponding uncertainties !h= (!h1;:::; !hnC)

For the sake of evaluating the performance of our BED,
we ﬁrst set the number of nuclear spins to nC= 2 as an ex-
ample and simulate experiments based on these settings un-
der an XY8-4 dynamical-decoupling sequence with a deco-
herence time T2= 3ms. The control parameter takes val-
ues ranging from 1s to10s with a step size = 10 ns,
i.e.,C=f1;1:01;1:02;:::; 10gs, whereas the pulse ampli-
tudes satisfy the condition tpulse. To reduce the num-
ber of iterations before convergence, faithful read-out oper-
ations are used, viz., p0=p1= 1. The EIG is updated
once every 15 single-shot measurements to take full advan-
tage of the computational resources. Additional details of the
simulation setup are reported in Appendix A and the values
of the parameters to be estimated that we use are !h=2=
(47:0;83:8)kHz and= (30;21)based on realistic pa-
rameters reported in Ref. [52]. During this experiment, for
each single-shot event ei, we ﬁrst conduct the measurement
withi, record the result di, and then update Pr ((!h;)jD)
accordingly, where the choice of iis optimized via EDist KL.
AfterNshot= 1050 measurements, the number of measure-
mentsN

Fig. 1(a) as crosses. From this, we obtain the averaged re-
sults d(empty circles) by d=PN

shot, wheredj
is thejth result of all single-shot measurements conducted
at. It can be seen that the dips of dcorrespond to the
peaks ofN
shot. This indicates that our BED improves the
efﬁciency by spending most resources on measurements un-
der an optimized subset of control-parameter values. Further-
more, we plot the posterior distribution Pr ((!h;)jD)after
Nshot= 1050 in Fig. 1(b) and (d) in the form of marginal
distributions. Based on Pr ((!h;)jD), we obtain the ﬁnal
estimation results of (!h;)and show the population of the
probeP0=h0j[exp(64L)j0ih0j]j0i, obtained under the dy-
namics generated by Eq. (6) in Fig. 1(c) as a blue solid line.
Moreover, we also depict the population P0derived by the
theoretical values of (!h;)in Fig. 1(c) as an orange dashed
line. The coinciding behavior of the two curves demonstrates
the validity of our scheme.
As a next step, in order to evaluate the relative accuracy
of our BED, we repeat this experiment 300 times. Dur-
ing thejth repetition, we record !hj,j,!hj, and j
against the number of single-shot measurements Nshot. Here,
we use the mean relative uncertainties given by 2!hj=PnC
q=12!hqj=nCand2j=PnC
q=12qj=nC. After 300
repetitions, we calculate the median !hRMS of the recorded
relative uncertainty (2!h1;:::; 2!h300)and compare the
results (empty squares) with those of the traditional non-
adaptive protocol without a control parameter optimization
(empty circles) in Fig. 2. At Nshot= 1050 (highlighted by
a dashed square), an averaged shot count per unique is1:17,
i.e., N
shot=Nshot=jCj 1:17. Here, we ﬁnd that the non-
adaptive method has failed to meet a relative uncertainty goal5

shot. In contrast, our BED can
achieve a relative uncertainty !hRMS<2%, which mani-
fests that our BED is capable of utilizing the limited experi-
mental resources efﬁciently.
Furthermore, in order to quantify the performance of the
BED in this model, we also randomly generate Nbench= 900
different combinations of (!h;)withnC= 2 . Instead
of repeating experiments under the same (!h;)multiple
times, we carry out one experiment for each combination of
(!h;)generated beforehand. After conducting the experi-
ments based on Nbench combinations, we denote the median of
the mean relative uncertainties (2!h1;:::; 2!hNbench)and
(21;:::; 2Nbench)as!hRMS andRMS. We then plot
!hRMS andRMS of our BED versus Nshotin Fig. 3 as
orange empty squares. For comparison, we simulate exper-
iments of using a non-adaptive protocol under the same set-
tings, and plot their scaling of the relative uncertainties in
Fig. 3 as blue empty circles. The general relative uncer-
tainty RMS= maxf!hRMS;RMSgbased on our method
is2:6%while for the non-adaptive method we ﬁnd RMS=
13:8%atNshot= 1350 . Overall, by adopting our BED, a re-
duction of over 90% inNshotfor the same relative uncertainty
can be observed.
To further investigate the abilities of our BED, we repeat
the above test with nC= 3 neighboring nuclear spins and
plot!hRMS as well as RMS versusNshotin Fig. 4. For
!hRMS , a reduction of 65% is observed at Nshot= 9975 ,
while a reduction of 72% inRMScan be seen at the same
shot count. This shows that our BED signiﬁcantly improves
the estimation accuracy of the parameters and further demon-

strates the feasibility of our scheme.
B. Oscillating magnetic ﬁeld detection with NV center
Not only is our BED useful when an accurate likelihood
function is available, but it also has advantages over traditional
methods when combined with imperfect likelihood functions.
In this subsection, we discuss our BED in a scenario where6
a qubit probe encoded in a single NV-center spin is used to
sense an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld.
The probe is subject to an external oscillating magnetic ﬁeld
as well as additional sources of noise. In this case, the effec-
tive Hamiltonian of the probe after aligning the NV-center axis
with the magnetic ﬁeld [64] can be written as
^Heff(t) =~B
2h(t) cos(!t+')^z+^Hnoise(t); (16)
in which=2= 28:03MHz/mT is the gyromagnetic ratio
of the electron spin and h(t)is the modulation function deter-
mined by the dynamical-decoupling pulses. In this case, the
parameters that have to be estimated in order to determine the
dynamics of the system are x= (B;!;' ), i.e., the magnitude,
frequency, and initial phase of the magnetic ﬁeld to be mea-
sured. However, since we assume that we do not record times-
tamps for each measurement, we have to average over the
phase'(see Appendix B). Effectively, the parameters to be
estimated are thereby only (!;B). Furthermore, ^Hnoise(t)in
the above Hamiltonian represents the effective action of noise
on the probe and we apply an XY8 dynamical-decoupling
pulse sequence [61] in order to protect the probe from this un-
wanted environmental inﬂuence to some degree [9]. The dy-
namical decoupling sequences used here serve two purposes:
amplifying the oscillating magnetic ﬁeld being measured and
extending the coherence time of the sensor. The time re-
lated to the free-evolution time of the pulse sequence, again,
is the control parameter. As shown in Appendix B, if we as-
sume a coherence time T2, the averaged ideal probability (2)
of preserving the initial state j0ireads

However, to attain a suitable numerical efﬁciency in our im-

pendix A. After the simulation, we plot the medians of the
relative uncertainty !andBversusNshotfor our BED (or-
ange squares) and the traditional non-adaptive method (blue
circles) in Fig. 5. Based on the benchmark, we ﬁnd that our
BED outperforms the traditional method even with an imper-
fect likelihood function, showing its feasibility for this sce-
nario.
IV . ACCELERATED COMPUTATION
Despite the fact that BED can utilize experimental re-
sources efﬁciently, it remains a challenge to avoid adverse7
effects from the computational consumption. When applied
to the ﬁeld of quantum sensing in actual laboratory settings,
one might ﬁnd that the increase in computational time can
outweigh the time saved by using optimized measurements.
Therefore, several possible solutions have been put forward
to mitigate this issue, such as applying BED to simple sys-
tems with suitable heuristics [28, 47] and resorting to com-
puter clusters [43]. However, in more generalized systems,
previous efforts cannot reduce the time cost of a BED effec-
tively [43, 45]. Here, we propose that a single consumer-grade
GPGPU along with an asynchronous version of our BED can
greatly reduce or eliminate the computational overhead for
more general systems and demonstrate the feasibility within
the model introduced in Sec. III A.
A. GPGPU acceleration
We ﬁrst give an overview of the computing resources for
our BED. The computational resources required by our BED
scale linearly with the number of particles npused in the SMC
method. For the system discussed in Sec. III A, the averaged
time spent by the probe during a single-shot measurement is
t270s, excluding initialization and read-out. The like-
lihood function Eq. (9) is evaluated npjCj 1:95105times
per measurement based on our EIG usage and np= 3200 .
These parameters mean a throughput of roughly 7:2108
evaluations per second for the likelihood function, which can
easily overwhelm a CPU. Fortunately, the performance of a
single GPGPU can satisfy such requirements without the bur-
den of setting up a computer cluster. However, existing al-
gorithms utilizing GPGPUs [65] only have inefﬁcient imple-
mentations. To deal with this problem, we design the algo-
rithms and relevant programs in-house such that both the SMC
method and the EIG efﬁciently run on the GPGPU [66]. Vec-
torization [67], usage of mixed-precision arithmetic [68], as
well as other techniques are adopted to fully accommodate the
power of the GPGPU. In addition, the fragmented communi-
cation between the GPGPU and other parts of the instruments
is minimized to reduce the overhead. As a result, our GPGPU
implementation signiﬁcantly reduces the time cost of the BED
without requiring expensive equipment.
To demonstrate these improvements, we retest the exper-
iments shown in Fig. 1. For comparison, an eight-core In-
tel Core i7 CPU running at 4:6GHz and an NVIDIA RTX
2080 Ti GPGPU are used, respectively. Numba [69] is used
for the CPU, while CuPy [70] provides software access to
the GPGPU. The experiments are repeated 10times before
recording the averaged time spent by both types of hardware.
In each repetition, Nshot= 18000 measurements are con-
ducted, and the evolution time of the probe needs at least
Nshott4:8s. We ﬁnd that the CPU spends 223:22s per ex-
perimental run and GPGPU completes the same computation
within merely 4:26s. The CPU can only achieve a throughput
of3:47107evaluations per second after ruling out overhead,
while the GPGPU can reach 7:18109evaluations per sec-
ond in throughput. Based on these results, hundreds of high
performance CPU cores are needed to match the performance

squares) and asynchronous (red crosses) version of the BED for sens-
ingnC= 2 nuclear spins based on Nbench= 900 different combina-
tions of (!h;). The asynchronous version of the BED has a delay

shot measurements Nshot. Bottom: Median of the relative uncertainty

offered by a single GPGPU, which is consistent with the high
performance computer setups in Ref. [43]. This also proves
that the practicality of our BED can be signiﬁcantly improved
by our GPGPU implementation.
B. Asynchronous operation
While GPGPUs can reduce the computation time to lev-
els comparable to the time spent by the probe, the absolute
sensitivity of the BED is still vulnerable to computational
overhead. Traditionally, instruments need to wait for opti-
mized control parameters before measurements in the BED
setups, which decreases the utilization of experimental time.
As a result, improvements in the absolute sensitivity of the
BED are degraded as reported in Ref. [45]. Here, we pro-
pose an asynchronous version of a BED in an effort to hide
computation time. In our asynchronous BED setup, the in-
struments no longer wait for optimal controls inferred from
the EIG EDist KL(c;D0). The optimization process starts be-
fore the instruments complete their operation for the previ-
ous iteration, such that the optimized control parameters will
be available upon the beginning of the next iteration. As a
compromise, the control parameters of the instruments are
based on all but the most recent measurements, i.e., ci=
argmaxc2CEDist KL(c;D0
old). Here,D0old= (d1;:::;di 1 T)
signiﬁes that the results of the last Tmeasurements are ig-
nored during the optimization. As we will show, this tech-
nique has minimal negative impact on the relative uncertainty
of the parameter-estimation results.
To test the degradation introduced by this technique, we
rerun the test from Sec. III A with nC= 2 andT= 15 af-8
ter changing the EIG to EDist KL(c;D0
old). A sufﬁciently large
delay [28] of Tt4ms is in place. In Fig. 6, we com-
pare the !hRMS andRMSobtained from an asynchronous
operation to those from Fig. 3. It can be observed that the
comparison shows only minimal discrepancies and that the
degradation caused by our asynchronous operation is negligi-
ble. By combining our asynchronous operation with the use
of a GPGPU, we can eliminate the overhead of our BED and
obtain a reduction of up to 90% in the total time cost, as com-
pared with traditional methods.
V . CONCLUSION
In this work, we have proposed a practical real-time adap-
tive quantum-sensing protocol guided by Bayesian experi-
mental design. Instead of heuristics, the model-agnostic EIG
was used as the utility function. The performance of this pro-
tocol was analyzed for sensing nuclear spins and oscillating
magnetic ﬁelds using an NV-center probe. Compared with
traditional methods, our protocol can signiﬁcantly reduce the
required experimental time and improve the sensitivity of the
measurements. Besides, we demonstrated two techniques to
reduce the overhead brought by computation and communica-
tion delay. We introduce a GPGPU acceleration and an asyn-
chronous operation to further enhance the performance of the
Bayesian experimental design and obtain a reduction of up to
90% in total time cost. With this signiﬁcant reduction, we be-
lieve the scheme presented here supplies viable prospects for
the improvement of quantum-sensing experiments.

Appendix A: Simulation setup details
For all simulations done in this paper, the basic dynamical-
decoupling sequence with eight pulse units is given by
Ry(=2)  Rx() 2 Ry() 2 Rx() 2 
Ry() 2 Ry() 2 Rx() 2 Ry() 2 
Rx()  Ry(3=2), whereR()with=x;ydenotes
a rotation of the probe state around the axis of the Bloch
sphere about an angle , while the probe evolves freely be-
tween pulses. The optimized iare produced in small batches
Cbatch= (i;i+1;:::;i+nbatch 1). The elements of C batchare
sampled from the distribution Pr batch()/[EDist KL(;D0)]p,in whichp= 6is determined by empirical tests. For the sim-
ulations in Sec. III A we choose nbatch= 15 whilenbatch= 30
is set for the experiments in Sec. III B.
To generate exact values of parameters that we want to
estimate in Sec. III, a combination of sweeping and ran-
domization is used. In detail, for the exact values used in
Sec. III A, the hyperﬁne couplings !h=2are generated by
sweeping through 19:0 83:4kHz, and the angles are sam-
pled from a uniform distribution on [0;2]. In Sec. III B, on
the other hand, we ﬁrst generate 20different frequencies !=2
by sweeping from 111kHz to 1:27MHz and then we sweep
the magnetic-ﬁeld strength Bfrom 0:031!= to0:169!= for
each value of !.
Finally, the technical aspects of our numerical simulation
setup work as follows. We use QInfer [65] with modiﬁcations
crucial for high throughput GPGPU operations. The bounds
for the estimation parameters are the same for both our BED
and the traditional method. In Sec. III A, for both methods the
upper and lower bounds for the elements of !h=2are given
by6kHz to 265kHz, respectively, and the prior distribution
given to our BED is a uniform distribution for both !hand
. In Sec. III B, B=! ranges from 0:013to0:177, while!
stays valid as long as 79:6kHz!=21:35MHz. We
note that while our use of the EIG as the utility function is not
sensitive to imprecise prior probabilities [71], imprecise pri-
ors might need non-trivial treatment for some tasks, such as
quantum-sensing tasks with few experimental runs. Discus-
sions on such topics can be found in Ref. [72]. In all simula-
tions, the number of particles used in the SMC method stays
constant throughout the experiment to simplify the discussion
related to computational resources in Sec. IV A. For experi-
ments conducted in Sec. III A, np= 6400 is used fornC= 3,
as the increase in computation time is tolerable (the com-
putation time increases 31% when compared with the time
recorded for nC= 2andnp= 3200 ). For other examples and
demonstrations, np= 3200 is used. As for resamplers used
in the SMC method, we chose the Liu-West resampler [73]
witha= 0:98and a naive remapping technique to mitigate
ambiguities in the particle distributions. We note that a differ-
ent resampler, such as the one proposed in Ref. [74], might be
more suitable for these models. The data of our simulations
are available in the [75].
For the traditional method being compared with, we use the
same SMC method and the same estimator as those used in the
BED. We do not use least-squared methods due to their fre-
quent divergence over the exact values (according to our test-
ing, least-squares-based estimations seldom converge to exact
values even when the exact population numbers are supplied).
This behavior of poor performance can be attributed to the
high dynamic-range and the non-convexity of our demonstra-
tions. In addition, the traditional method does not have ac-
cess to utility function. Instead, a random number generator
governs the control parameters used for each single-shot mea-
surement. Doing so can improve consistency in results when
averaged shot count per unique control parameter is small,
while having the same effects as parameter-scanning once suf-
ﬁciently large amount of measurements are conducted.9
Appendix B: Likelihood function of the probe sensing AC
magnetic ﬁeld
A rigorous formalism of the dynamics of the population of a
spin probe subject to an external signal and noise can be found
in Refs. [9, 76]. Here, we provide, for the sake of complete-
ness, an elementary yet self-contained derivation of Eq. (17).
Owing to the XY8 dynamical-decoupling pulse sequence, the
probe is protected from external noises with low frequencies,
and the modulation function becomes
h(t) =(
1; t2[(4k 1);(4k+ 1))
 1; t2[(4k+ 1);(4k+ 3)):(B1)
The probe is initialized in the state j0i, and if we neglect ad-
ditional decoherence, ^Hnoise(t)will effectively not contribute
to the probability of the probe preserving j0i. If we denote the
state at time t= 16, i.e., after the pulse sequence, by jiwe
thus ﬁnd the probability
jh0jij2=1
2[1 + cos(acos(8!+'))] (B2)at the read-out, with agiven in Eq. (18).
As mentioned in the main text, no timestamps are recorded
for each measurement and the initial phase 'must there-
fore be averaged out. Assuming the intervals between
measurements to follow a uniform distribution, the aver-
aged probability can be obtained according to jh0jij2=R2
0jh0jij2d'=2and reads
jh0jij2=1
2[1 +J0(a)] (B3)
with the Bessel function J0. Equation (17) is then obtained
by adding an exponential decay toward a probability 1=2with
the coherence time T2to the expression above. Since in our
situation we have a1, we employ the truncated series ex-
pansion
J0(a) = 1 1
4a2+1
64a4 1
2304a6+O(a8) (B4)
of the Bessel function for the sake of numerical efﬁciency.
