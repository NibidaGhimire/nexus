Abstract. We construct dynamics for the defocusing real-valued (Miur a)
mKdV equation on the real line with initial data distributed according to
Gibbs measure. We also prove that Gibbs measure is invariant under these
dynamics. On the way, we provide a new proof of the invariance of the Gibbs
measure under mKdV on the torus.
Building on these results, we construct new measure-preser ving dynamics
for the KdV equation on the whole real line. Samples from this family of mea-
sures exhibit the same local regularity as white-noise, but completely diﬀerent
statistics!

forx∈Ror forx∈TL:=R/2LZwithL >0. The former will be referred to
as the line or inﬁnite-volume case, while the latter constitutes the ﬁn ite-volume or
periodic case.
This equation was originally introduced by Miura [31] through its conne ction to
the Korteweg–de Vries equation. It was subsequently realized tha t (mKdV) is an
eﬀective model for many physical scenarios.
We are interested in studying the (mKdV) dynamics at thermal equilib rium,
particularly, in the inﬁnite-volume setting. This necessitates solving (mKdV) with
initial data chosen at random from the Gibbs distribution (described below) and
demonstrating that these solutions lead to a measure-preserving transformation of
the Gibbs state. This is inherently a low regularity problem, further c ompounded
by the lack of spatial decay. Indeed, the Gibbs state is a stationar y process. The
absence of spatial decay places this problem outside the scope of t he much-studied
well-posedness theory in Hsspaces.
The description of Gibbs states rests on the underlying Hamiltonian s tructure.
The (mKdV) dynamics is generated by the Hamiltonian

A second important conserved quantity associated with (mKdV) is
M(q) =/integraldisplay
1
2q2dx, (1.4)
which may be regardedas either the mass or the momentum of the wa ve, depending
on the physical context. This functional generates translations under the Poisson
structure (1.2).
The two conserved quantities combine naturally into a single free ene rgy
HmKdV(q)−µM(q), (1.5)
whereµ∈Rplays the role of a chemical potential. This in turn gives rise to the
following two-parameter family of Gibbs states:
1
Zexp{−β(HmKdV−µM)}d(phase volume) . (1.6)
Here,β >0 denotes the inverse temperature and Z=Z(β,µ) is the partition
function, which is included in order to normalize this as a probability mea sure.
The natural notion of phase-space volume is induced by the underly ing Poisson
structure. In view of (1.2), we ought to adopt product Lebesgue measure on the
Fourier coeﬃcients; however, such an inﬁnite product measure do es not exist.
We describe the rigorous construction of (1.6) in Section 2. For the moment
however, we wish to give the reader an intuitive picture of samples fr om the GibbsINVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 3
state (1.6). To this end, we rewrite the free energy density as
1
2(∂xq)2+U(q(x)) withU(y) =1
2y4−µ
2y2. (1.7)
The ﬁrst term penalizes rapid changes in q(x), ensuring that it maintains the reg-
ularity of Brownian motion. The second term endeavors to keep the process in
regions where Uis small. In Corollary 2.14, we give a precise meaning to this
heuristic in a manner inspired by the Itˆ o SDE representation of the process:
dq=ψ′
0(q)
ψ0(q)dt+dB (1.8)
whereψ0denotes the ground-state of the Schr¨ odinger operator (2.2).
Building on this intuitive picture, we see that when µis large and positive,
the process q(x) will remain near the two well-separated minima of U(y) for the
overwhelming fraction of x, with very occasional transits between them. This leads
us to regard the corresponding Gibbs state as representing a dilut e soup of kinks
evolving within a thermal background. We remind the reader that kin ks are the
topological solitons indigenous to (mKdV). The desire to cover this p hysically
important case was a major driver for including the chemical potent ialµin our
deﬁnition of the Gibbs state.
To truly fulﬁll its promise of describing thermal equilibrium, a Gibbs sta te ought
to be shown to be dynamically invariant. For ﬁnite-dimensional syste ms, this is
typically elementary. However, it becomes a subtle matter even for the most basic
inﬁnite-dimensional systems, such as a gas in inﬁnite volume or a class ical ﬁeld
theory(even) in ﬁnite volume. In both cases, the total energyis in ﬁnite. The model
treated here combines both inﬁnities: the inﬁnite energy density of a classical ﬁeld
(the famous Rayleigh–Jeanscatastrophe) andinﬁnite volume. Nevertheless, we are
able to construct dynamics and prove that it conserves the Gibbs la w:
Theorem 1.1. For all values of temperature and chemical potential, solut ions of
(mKdV) deﬁne a measure-preserving group of transformations of the Gibbs state.
A more detailed formulation of this result can be found in Theorem 6.1. In par-
ticular, we show that q(t,x) is both a distributional and green solution of (mKdV)
and that /an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht−1q(t,x) is anL2(R)-continuous function of time. For the notion of
green solution, see Deﬁnition 3.11. One of the virtues of this notion is that such
solutions retain the conservation laws characteristic of (mKdV).
As an oﬀshoot of our analysis, we will also provide a new proof of invar iance
of the Gibbs state for (mKdV) in ﬁnite volume; see Theorem 4.3. This r esult was
ﬁrst demonstrated in [3]. The corresponding result for generalized KdV equations
was subsequently proved in [6, 40]. In each case, the approach was to develop a
suitable deterministic well-posedness result. This was then combined with ﬁnite-
dimensional approximation to obtain preservation of measure, whic h was in turn
used to construct global solutions (almost surely). We note that t he Fourier-based
methods employed in all these works are ill-suited to the problem in inﬁn ite volume
and so do not inform our analysis here.
There are two alternate approaches to the well-posedness of (mK dV) that have
proven successful at the low regularity inherent to samples from t he Gibbs state.
Usingthe constructionofaction/anglevariablesforthe Korteweg –deVriesequation

in [19] and the link to (mKdV) provided by the Miura transformation
(1.9) w=q′+q2,
the global well-posedness of (mKdV) in L2(T) was proved in [18]. At this moment,
there is no analogue of this approach demonstrating well-posednes s inL2(R). This
incompatibilitywiththeinﬁnite-volumeregimeleadsustoregardthisas anonviable
approach to proving Theorem 1.1.
The second method is based on the commuting ﬂowsparadigm of [23], w hich was
appliedto (mKdV) in [10, 14, 24]. This is the method that we will be applyin g. One
key part of this approach is the introduction of regularized ﬂows th at approximate
(mKdV)buthavemuchbetterhigh-frequencybehavior. Thisbett erbehaviorallows
us to construct solutions to these ﬂows by simple contraction mapp ing arguments.
Moreover, the weaker transport of these approximating ﬂows aid s in passing to
the inﬁnite-volume limit. It is only in inﬁnite volume that we will remove the
regularization; this in turn is aided by the fact that the regularized ﬂ ows commute
with one another, as well as with (mKdV).
The foregoing discussion has focused on the well-posedness theor y of (mKdV)
becausethattheorybothinformsthemethodsweemployandembo diesthestrength
of the results that we obtain, including, conservation laws and the g roup property.
By comparison, the existence of weak solutions (without uniquenes s) to (mKdV) is
much older; for example, this was shown for initial data in L2(R) already in [20].
There is a corresponding theory of random weak solutions based on Prokhorov’s
compactness criterion for probability measures; this theory was d eveloped in a
manner applicable to (mKdV) in inﬁnite-volume in the paper [5].
The ﬁnal section of the paper is devoted to the construction of ne w invariant
measures for (KdV) by applying the Miura map (1.9) to the Gibbs-dist ributed
solutions to (mKdV) described in Theorem 1.1. The culmination of thes e results
may be summarized as follows:
Theorem 1.2. The(KdV)evolution deﬁnes a measure-preserving group of trans-
formations of the image of the Gibbs state under the Miura map .
As we have noted earlier, samples qfrom the (mKdV) Gibbs state have the reg-
ularity of Brownian motion. Correspondingly, the random distributio nswdeﬁned
through (1.9) have the regularity of white noise. This informal asse rtion is made
precise in Proposition 7.3. Moreover, we show there that this proce ss is not white
noise: it is not Gaussian and its law is mutually singular to that of white no ise!
The question of whether (KdV) preserves white noise has attract ed signiﬁcant
attention. In ﬁnite volume, this was settled via a variety of methods in [32, 33, 34,
35, 36]. In the whole-line setting, this was proved in [22].
At ﬁrst glance, it is natural to wonder what invariant measurefor ( mKdV) might
correspond (under the Miura map) to white noise in inﬁnite volume. Th e answer is
none! A characteristic property of the image of the Miura map is tha t Schr¨ odinger
operators with such potentials are positive semi-deﬁnite. By compa rison, the white
noise potential leads to a Schr¨ odinger operator whose spectrum is the whole real
line.
While it is not atypical for completely integrable systems to admit multip le
Gibbs measures through the incorporation of higher conserved qu antities into the
construction of free energies (cf. [12, 47, 46]), the invariant mea sures described by
Theorem 1.2 do not ﬁt this mold at all. Indeed, we contend that the so liton gasesINVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 5
described by Theorem 1.2 lie outside the traditional Gibbsian framewo rk, which
makes them very interesting indeed.
As described in [22], white noise corresponds to the lowest-regularit y coercive
conservation law for (KdV), namely, M(w) :=/integraltext1
2w2dx. The introduction of
higher conservation laws into the Gibbs weight would make the samples smoother
in contradiction to the regularity of the samples just described. Th ere is a second
issue: with the exception of M(w), the conservation laws associated to (KdV) are
not coercive. In particular, there is no Gibbs state analogous to (1 .6) because the
potential energy is unbounded below.
FailureofcoercivityoftheHamiltonianisatypicalfeatureforfocus ingequations,
suchas(KdV). Followingtheleadof[26], ithasbecomestandardprac ticetoimpose
a mass cutoﬀ to overcome this. Unfortunately, this approach is on ly applicable in
ﬁnite volume; see [22] for references and further discussion.
1.1.Overview of the paper. While the overall strategy we employ in this paper
owes much to [22], the implementation is very diﬀerent. Although white noise is
very irregular, it is probabilistically very simple: it is Gaussian and indepe ndent
on disjoint intervals. The law of Gibbs samples is much less explicit and, o f course,
carries correlations. Correspondingly, the probabilistic analysis he re is essentially
disjoint from that of [22].
Perhaps the most conspicuous metamorphosis relative to [22] is th e absence of
any multiscale analysis (the most technical part of that work). This transformation
of the method relies on our identiﬁcation of a subtle diﬀerence betwe en the two
models in the earliest phase of the argument, which then initiates a ca scade of
improvements. This diﬀerence is the relativistic speed limit inherent to the Lax
operator associated to (mKdV), which has the structure of a Dira c operator. This
manifests already in Proposition 3.1 and in the universality of the Comb es–Thomas
estimate (3.15).
Section 2 is devoted to the rigorous construction of the Gibbs meas ure (1.6) and
the elaboration of its key properties. Our approach is via ﬁnite marg inals and the
Feynman–Kac formula. Although this approach is not new (cf. [29, 4 3, 48]), it is
signiﬁcantly less well-known than its principal competitor. Nowadays , the preemi-
nent approach is to begin with a Gaussian measure, which is then modiﬁ ed by an
appropriate Radon–Nikodym derivative. This latter method, popula rized by [26],
is indeed very eﬀective in ﬁnite volume. It is also well-matched to the pr evailing
approachto the constructionofsolutions, basedontreatingthe nonlinearitypertur-
batively. Nevertheless, this approach is ill-suited to our problem bec ause in inﬁnite
volume, Gibbs measure is mutually singular to the corresponding Gaus sian ﬁeld!
Oneotherapproachtothethermodynamiclimit istoﬁrstconstruct ﬁnite-volume
Gibbs measures via their Radon–Nikodym derivative and then use cor relation in-
equalities to prove tightness of the resulting sequence of laws. This style of argu-
ment underpins the study the Gibbs state for NLS in [4], but relies on t he chemical
potential being negative.
Given the breakdown of the naive notion (1.6) described above, it is n atural to
ask if there is an intrinsic way of identifying the proper Gibbs state. I t was for this
purpose that the DLR condition was introduced in [9, 25]. It says tha t an inﬁnite-
volume measure is a Gibbs state if the conditional law on ﬁnite windows m atches
the Gibbs law given the state exterior to the window. For particle sys tems, this has6 J. FORLANO, R. KILLIP, AND M. VIS ¸AN
become the settled deﬁnition; however, for ﬁelds, the rule (1.6) br eaks down even
in ﬁnite volume.
An alternateapproachto deﬁning classicalGibbs states originates from the KMS
(Kubo–Martin–Schwinger) condition in quantum statistical physics (cf. [13]). The
classical analogue of this is discussed, for example, in [11, 21, 30]. Fo r particle
systems, it was shown to be equivalent to the DLR condition in [1].
We will prove that our Gibbs states satisfy not only the traditional c lassical
KMS condition (Theorem 2.6), but also the natural synthesis of the DLR and KMS
conditions; see Proposition 2.5. At the beginning of subsection 2.1, w e illustrate
how the classical KMS condition is closely tied to the question of invaria nce in the
ﬁnite-dimensional setting. Our inspiration for considering it here an d for regarding
it as way-point on the road to proving dynamical invariance was the r ecent paper
[2], which considers classical ﬁelds in ﬁnite volume.

of the ﬁnite-volume Gibbs laws and that in inﬁnite volume. This is provide d by
subsection 2.2.
Subsections 2.3 and 2.4 demonstrate mixing of the Gibbs process and its relation
to diﬀusions, respectively, showing how directly such properties ma y be deduced
from our chosen construction of the Gibbs state.
Section 3 is devoted to the deterministic theory of the (mKdV) Lax o perator
under the very mild condition (3.2). A particular focus of this section is to obtain
bounds on the diagonal Green’s functions and to control their dep endence on q.
Due to the wide scope aﬀorded by our hypothesis (3.2), we believe ma ny of the
results of this section will be useful in the study of (mKdV) more bro adly. For
example, these results cover almost periodic and step-like initial dat a.
In the latter part of Section 3, we review some parts of the method of commuting
ﬂows as implemented in [10]. The deﬁnition of the regularized Hamiltonian s is
presented in (3.65) and the key properties of the induced ﬂows are covered by
Proposition 3.9.
In Section 4 wedemonstrate the invarianceofthe ﬁnite-volume Gibb s measurein
two cases: In Theorem 4.1 we treat the ﬂows associated to the reg ularized Hamil-
toniansHκ. Then, we prove invariance under (mKdV) by sending κ→ ∞; see
Theorem 4.3.
The goal of Section 5 is to construct regularized ﬂows in inﬁnite volum e and to
prove that they leave the Gibbs measure invariant; see Theorem 5.2 . Note that it
is much easier to take an inﬁnite volume limit for the regularized ﬂows, a s opposed
to (mKdV), because they have much weaker transportation prop erties.
In Section 6, we send κ→ ∞in theHκﬂows in order to construct solutions to
(mKdV) with Gibbsian initial data in inﬁnite volume. Amongst other thing s, we
prove that these solutions have the group property, preserve G ibbs measure, and
satisfymicroscopicconservationlaws; seeTheorem6.1. The Poisso ncommutativity
of the regularized Hamiltonians (for diﬀering values of κ) plays an essential role in
being able to control this κ→ ∞limit: It allows us to control the diﬀerence of
two such ﬂows by just analyzing the ﬂow under the diﬀerence Hamilto nian; see
Proposition 6.3.
Section 7 begins by discussing the connection between (KdV) and (m KdV) at
the level of the Lax operators. The latter part is divided into two su bsections: TheINVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 7
ﬁrst describes the image of the Gibbs state under the Miura mapping , while the
second demonstrates the existence of (KdV) solutions with such in itial data and
the invariance of measure.

2.Gibbs measures
By virtue of the scaling symmetry
(2.1) q(t,x)/ma√sto→λq(λ3t,λx)
enjoyed by (mKdV), we may reduce our consideration of the Gibbs s tates to the
caseβ= 1. This rescalingalters the chemical potential µ; however, its precise value
will not play a role in our analysis and henceforth, we will regard it as ﬁx ed. The
dependence of implicit and explicit constants on µwill not be tracked, nor typically
even noted.
We will ﬁrst introduce the Gibbs measure, both on the line and on the c ircle,
by simply declaring its marginal distributions at ﬁnitely many sample poin ts. This
deﬁnition and certain fundamental properties of the resulting pro cess are presented
in Proposition 2.2.
Later, we will justify that this measure is indeed the Gibbs measure b y showing
that it satisﬁes the classical KMS condition, which we ﬁnd to be just t he right
tool for proving dynamical invariance. We will also show that the who le-line Gibbs
measure is the limit of those on ever larger tori; indeed, our chosen c onstruction is
speciﬁcallygearedtowardourneed toprovequantitativeestimate s onthe proximity
of the whole-line distributions to those on large tori, as well as our ne ed to couple
together the random initial data following these laws.

whereV(0)∈Ris chosen so that the lowest eigenvalue of Lis zero. The essential
self-adjointness of this anharmonic oscillator on C∞
c(R) is shown in [38] (by ﬁve
diﬀerent methods!). The Rellich criterion (cf. [39]) guarantees that Lhas compact
resolvent. All eigenvalues of Lare necessarily simple as can be inferred by noting
that the Wronskian of two eigenvectors is both constant and integ rable. In view of
these properties, the spectral theory of Lis completely described by its eigenvalues
0 =λ0<λ1<λ2<···andL2-normalized eigenvectors ψ0,ψ1,ψ2,...
The eigenvector ψ0is necessarily sign-deﬁnite; we choose it to be positive.8 J. FORLANO, R. KILLIP, AND M. VIS ¸AN
As we will soon see, the ﬁnite marginal distributions of the Gibbs stat e may
be expressed in terms of the heat kernel e−tL(y,y′) associated to this Schr¨ odinger
operator. Let us review some of its basic properties:
Proposition 2.1. The heat kernel e−tL(y,y′)is non-negative and continuous as
(t,y,y′)ranges over (0,∞)×R×R; moreover, there exists ε>0so that

and we have the Hilbert–Schmidt bound

Hereψ0denotes the L2-normalized ground state of L, which itself satisﬁes
/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0(y)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/lessorsimilarexp(−ε|y|3). (2.6)
Proof.For a proof that the heat kernel is continuous, see [42, Thm B.7.1].
The right-hand side of (2.3) is essentially the fundamental solution t o the heat
equation (a numerical prefactor has been omitted). By the Feynm an–Kac formula,
this provides an upper bound for the heat kernel associated to an y one-dimensional
Schr¨ odinger operator with positive potential. Although the poten tialV(y) is not
positive, it is bounded from below. This energy shift produces an ext ra factor of
eCt, which is clearly bounded for t∈[0,1].
We may also compare the operator Lwith the harmonic oscillator
L0=−1
2∂2

Clearly, we may choose C >0 so that L ≥ L 0−Cas quadratic forms. As the
eigenvalues of L0are known to be precisely the non-negative integers, we infer that
the eigenvalues of Lgrow faster than some arithmetic progression. Thus,

This proves (2.5).

To estimate the terms on the right, we employ duality and the Feynma n–Kac

We are now readyto introduce the Gibbs distributions, both in ﬁnite a nd inﬁnite
volume. These are described by measures on appropriate spaces o f continuous
functions. In the ﬁnite-volume case, ( C(TL),B) denotes the (separable) Banach
space of bounded continuous real-valued functions endowed with t he supremum
norm and its associated Borel σ-algebra. The case of inﬁnite volume requires a
small adjustment because Gibbs samples are almost surely unbound ed functions.
We use (C(R),B) to denote the Polish space of continuous real-valued functions
endowed with the compact-open topology and its associated Borel σ-algebra. The
random process will be denoted q(x); a subscript indicating the half-period will
only be added when the distinction is needed.

Proof.Uniqueness boils down to this question: Do the measures of cylinder s ets
(which may be computed directly from the ﬁnite marginals) uniquely de termine
the measures of all Borel sets? The answer is yes. This is a standar d application
of theπ-λTheorem.
As the ﬁnite marginal distributions are invariant under spatial tran slations, this
uniqueness guarantees that any process with such marginals is aut omatically sta-
tionary.
Turning to the question of existence, let us ﬁrst observe that the systems of ﬁnite
marginals presented above are consistent and correspond to pro bability measures.
In the inﬁnite-volume setting, this follows from the positivity and the semigroup
property of the heat kernel together with the positivity of ψ0, itsL2normalization,
and the fact that it is a zero-energy eigenfunction. In the ﬁnite-v olume case, one
must also ensure that the operator traces are well deﬁned; this f ollows from the
Hilbert–Schmidt bound (2.5).
In order to prove the existence of a corresponding process, we w ish to employ
Kolmogorov’sextension theorem in concertwith his continuity criter ion. The latter
requires adequate moment bounds; these are readily deduced fro m Proposition 2.1.
Indeed, this result guarantees that
(2.21) P{|q(x)| ≥λ}/lessorsimilare−ελ3
and similarly that
(2.22) P{|q(x)−q(x′)| ≥λ}/lessorsimilarexp/parenleftbig

whenever |x−x′| ≤1.
In the ﬁnite-volume setting, |x−x′|denotes the natural distance in R/2LZ, namely,
(2.23) |x−x′|= min{|x−x′+2mL|:m∈Z}for points x,x′∈R/2LZ.
Let us turn now to (2.18). The driving idea is that for 0 <s<1, theWs,p(R)

which is amenable to analysis via (2.21) and (2.22). (This is also one appr oach to
proving Kolmogorov’s continuity criterion; see, for example, [44].)
We begin with the Lpnorm. From (2.21), we see that
/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleq(x)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble

Thus when bp>1 andr≥p, the triangle inequality in Lr/p(dP) shows

proves (2.18). The restriction to r≥pis inconsequential because higher moments
automatically control lower moments via Jensen’s inequality.

The description of the Gibbs state in terms of ﬁnite marginals is very c onvenient
for understanding certain conditional distributions. We are most in terested in the
following situation: given the value of qat the two ends of an arc on the circle,
what is the conditional law of qon this arc and the complementary arc. (In inﬁnite
volume, our two observation points divide the line into three intervals .) Let us ﬁrst
state the key observations; the physical signiﬁcance will be addre ssed later.

The description of the conditional distribution by Pis not entirely unique — the
deﬁning identity would still be obeyed if Pwere modiﬁed on a Lebesgue null set of
its arguments. Nevertheless, the representative presented is t he unique continuous
one. The identity (2.27) has a simple interpretation: the restriction s ofqLto the
two arcs joining aandbinR/2LZare conditionally independent given the values
ofqLat the two ends.
A more complete description of the inﬁnite volume case is this: the res trictions
ofqto the three intervals ( −∞,a], [a,b], and [b,∞) are conditionally independent
givenq(a) andq(b); moreover the law on the middle interval is described by (2.28).
As a single point suﬃces to disconnect the line, one may consider a sing le ob-
servation point bin the inﬁnite-volume setting. The analogue of (2.27) is simply
the Markov property: the restrictions of qto (−∞,b] and [b,∞) are conditionally
independent given q(b).
Nevertheless, there is a good reason to consider the process with two observation
points, even in the line setting, namely, the DLR condition. This condit ion was
introducedtodeﬁnethenotionofGibbsstateininﬁnite-volumelattic emodelswhen
the underlying Hamiltonian involves ﬁnite-range interactions. For su ch models,
ﬁnite volume Gibbs states can be constructed without diﬃculty; likew ise, Gibbs
states on a ﬁnite region with prescribed values on the boundary are easily deﬁned.
The DLR condition is this: an inﬁnite-volume measure is a Gibbs measure if and
only if the ﬁnite-volume conditional laws conditioned on the boundary data are
correct. Lemma 2.3 already veriﬁes one facet of this by showing tha t the ﬁnite-
and inﬁnite-volume measures have identical conditional laws. The qu estion of the
correctness of these conditional laws will be addressed by Propos ition 2.5, where
we demonstrate a version of the KMS condition. For this purpose, w e will need the
following integration by parts identity:

for any choices of ξj∈Randa=x0<x1<···<xn<xn+1=b. To see this, one
ﬁrst breaks the interval [ a,b] into pieces [ xj,xj+1] and applies (2.29) on each such
smaller interval.
Choosingξjwisely we obtain a close variant of the sought-after identity. The
only diﬀerence is that all integrals involving ψ(x) are replaced by Riemann sums.
A simple approximation argument using (2.18) completes the proof. /square

In general, the free energy Eis not simply the Hamiltonian Hbut a linear

Thus KMS states are dynamical invariant whenever {H,E}= 0.
We caution the reader that the preceding calculations took place in a ﬁnite-
dimensional paradise, devoid of analytic subtleties. Serious obstac les must be over-
come to obtain dynamical invariance for interesting inﬁnite-dimensio nal systems.14 J. FORLANO, R. KILLIP, AND M. VIS ¸AN

Combining these Poisson brackets with (2.31), we are lead to the follo wing form of
KMS condition for (mKdV). It holds with any prescribed boundary co nditions and
so is stronger condition than the traditional KMS condition. It arise s naturally as
a synthesis of the KMS and DLR conditions.
Proposition 2.5 (Joint KMS/DLR condition) .FixL∈2N∪ {∞}. The Gibbs
distribution deﬁned in Proposition 2.2 satisﬁes the follow ing: Given a<b<a +2L

Taking the (unconditional) expectation of both sides of (2.35) show s that our
Gibbs distributions satisfy the traditional KMS condition.
The speciﬁc test functions F(q) andG(q) permitted in Proposition 2.5 are not
well suited to proving dynamical invariance of these Gibbs measures . Our next
result, Theorem 2.6, addresses this. We will restrict attention to t he ﬁnite volume
setting because that is what we need.
Given a function F:L2(TL)→Rand a frequency cutoﬀ N∈2N, we deﬁne a

whenFandGtake the form (2.32) with φ,ψ∈C∞(TL) both vanishing in the same
small arc. The arc in question contains the conditioning points aandbemployed
in Proposition 2.5.
The restriction that ψvanish is easily removed by approximation employing
(2.18). Such an argument does not extend easily to φdue to the presence of terms
such as/integraltext
φ′′′qdx.
Hereisthe simple remedy: Firstdecompose φ=φ1+φ2suchthat eachsummand
vanishes on some arc. Now use (2.39) not with the original FandGbut rather on
each summand in the representation
F(q)G(q) =ei/integraltext
φ1q·ei/integraltext
(ψ+φ2)q+ei/integraltext
φ2q·ei/integraltext
(ψ+φ1)q.
In this way, we deduce that (2.39) and so also (2.38) hold when FandGtake the
form (2.32) with general φ,ψ∈C∞(TL). Specializing to φandψbeing trigono-
metric polynomials, it follows that (2.38) holds whenever FandGare complex
exponentials built from the Fourier coeﬃcients of q≤N.
On the other hand, FN=F(q≤N) is ultimately a C1function of (ﬁnitely many)
Fourier coeﬃcients of qN. Thus it may be approximated by ﬁnite sums of complex
exponentials of the form just described. In fact, given any C1functionf:Rd→R
for whichfand∇fare uniformly bounded, there is a sequence of trigonometric
polynomials fnwith the properties that
sup
n,x|fn(x)|+|∇fn(x)|<∞and/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef(x)−fn(x)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle+/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∇f(x)−∇fn(x)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle−→0
uniformly on compact sets. This is readily shown, for example, by tru ncation, pe-
riodization, and Fej´ er summation. This quality of approximation suﬃ ces to deduce
(2.38) in full generality. /square
2.2.Coupling Gibbs measures. It is not diﬃcult to verify that ﬁnite-volume
Gibbs distributions converge to that in inﬁnite volume as L→ ∞. Once one has
convergence in distribution, the general Skorohod coupling allows o ne to realize
all these Gibbs processes on a single probability space in such a way th at samples
from the ﬁnite-volume Gibbs laws converge almost surely to those of the inﬁnite
volume Gibbs state. (Here convergence means uniformly on compac t sets.) Such
a coupling is evidently necessary if we wish to transfer dynamical sta tements from
ﬁnite to inﬁnite volume.
Unfortunately, such generalitiesdonot suﬃceto overcomethe st rongtransporta-
tion present in the ﬂows we study. We need the following very strong quantitative
version:
Proposition 2.7. There is a single probability space supporting Gibbs distri buted

While we do not truly need an exponential rate of convergence, no p olynomial
rate would be fast enough; see, for example, the proof of Lemma 5 .4. We begin
with a well-known coupling technique:
Lemma 2.8. LetfX,fY∈L1(R2)be probability density functions and suppose that
X: Ω→R2is a random variable with law fX. Then there is a product probability
spaceΩ×Ω′endowed with product measure and a random variable Y: Ω×Ω′→R2
with lawfYso that
P(X/ne}ationslash=Y) =1
2/ba∇dblfX−fY/ba∇dblL1 (2.41)
and so that Yis conditionally independent of every Z: Ω→RgivenX.
Proof.If RHS(2.41) vanishes then we may take Y≡X. IffXandfYare unequal,
then we augment the probability space to include random variables UandWthat
are statistically independent of one another and of any random var iable deﬁned
over Ω. We choose Uto be uniformly distributed over [0 ,1] andWto beR2-valued
with probability density

where the wedge symbol denotes minimum. We then deﬁne

By combining Lemmas 2.3 and 2.9, we may deduce that as L→ ∞, all ﬁnite
marginals of ˜ qLconverge to those of q∞. Concretely, one chooses a=−L/2 and
b=L/2, then exploits the fact that the conditional marginals are identica l. This
leads us to the means of coupling the processes: First couple XLtoYLexactly as in
Lemma 2.9. Because the conditional marginals are identical, we can ac tually make
qLandq∞identical on the interval [ −L/2,L/2] whenever XL=YL.
Before we present the details, let us quickly review the important co ncept of
extension by conditioning.
Concomitant with the notion of conditional expectation is that of dis integration.
The Disintegration Theorem guarantees that there is a map y/ma√sto→µyof points in
R2to Borel probability measures on C(TL) with the property that
E/bracketleftbig
F(˜qL)/bracketrightbig
=/integraldisplay/integraldisplay
FdµyfYL(y)dy.
The mapy/ma√sto→µyis known as a probability kernel.
More generally, given a probability space (Ω 0,P0) together with a random vari-
ableY: Ω0→R2that has the same law as YL, we may deﬁne a probability kernel
on Ω0viaω/ma√sto→νω:=µY(ω).
This second probability kernel νallows us to deﬁne an augmented probability
space Ω 0×C(TL) with expectation
E/bracketleftbig
F(ω,q)/bracketrightbig
=/integraldisplay/integraldisplay
F(ω,q)dνω(q)dP0(ω).
By construction, the random variable qis Gibbs distributed and it is conditionally
independent of any random variable Z: Ω0→RgivenY.
In this example, we performed a single extension of a given probability space.
We would like to do this inﬁnitely many times, once for each L∈2N. The fact that
this is possible is know as the Ionescu-Tulcea Theorem; see, for exa mple, [16, §8].
Proof of Proposition 2.7. Let us begin with a realization of q∞, which is Gibbs
distributed on R. This probability space also realizes all random variables XL
deﬁned by (2.42).18 J. FORLANO, R. KILLIP, AND M. VIS ¸AN
ByrepeatedlyapplyingLemmas2.8and2.9, itispossibletoaugmentour original
probability space to realize new random variables YLwhose laws match those given
by (2.42) and also satisfy
P(XL/ne}ationslash=YL)/lessorsimilare−εL
uniformly in L. Note that q∞andYLare conditionally independent given XL.
Strictly speaking, the argument just presented applies only to ﬁnit e collections
ofL∈2N; however, this demonstrates the consistency of these joint dist ributions
and so guarantees that one may realize the YLforallL∈2N.
Combining the Disintegrationand Ionescu-TulceaTheorems, we may now realize
processes ˜qLthat are Gibbs distributed on TLfor allL∈2Nand satisfy the second
identity in (2.42).
Our construction ensures that q∞and ˜qLare conditionally independent given
XL. This is important because together with Lemma 2.3 it guarantees th at the
four processes
q∞/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
[−L/2,L/2], q∞/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
[−L/2,L/2]c,˜qL/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
[−L/2,L/2],and ˜qL/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
[L/2,3L/2](2.45)
are conditionally independent given XLandYL.
We are now ready to deﬁne the random variables qL: Forx∈[−L,L],
qL(x) =/braceleftBigg
q∞(x) :x∈[−L/2,L/2] andYL=XL,
˜qL(x) : otherwise.(2.46)
We continue this deﬁnition 2 L-periodically throughout R.
It isclearthat (2.40) holds. To verifythat qLis indeed Gibbs distributed, we just
need to show that it has the same distribution as ˜ qL. This in turn follows from two
observations: First, the values of qLon the complementary arcs [ −L/2,L/2] and
[L/2,3L/2] are conditionally independent given XLandYL. Secondly, restricting
attention to the arc [ −L/2,L/2], the conditional distributions of qLand ˜qLgiven
XLandYLare identical. This is a consequence of Lemma 2.3. /square
2.3.Mixing properties. It is well-known that the the whole-line Gibbs state is
not only ergodic under translations, but even (strong) mixing. Muc h later in the
paper, we shall rely on ergodicity in order to understand the action of the Miura
map; moreover, in Corollary 2.12 we will use it to show that diﬀerent ch emical
potentials and/or temperatures lead to mutually singular Gibbs meas ures. Rather
than settle for ergodicity, we will prove mixing because the following le mma, in-
spired by [41], allows us to give an eﬃcient treatment based on the pre liminaries
we have already presented.
Lemma 2.10. Letqbe Gibbs distributed on the whole line and ﬁx points a<bin
R. Given random variables F,G∈L2(dP)that are measurable with respect to the
sigma algebras generated by {q(x) :x≤a}and{q(x) :x≥b}, respectively, then
/vextendsingle/vextendsingleE(FG)−E(F)E(G)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤e−λ1(b−a)/radicalbig
E(F2)E(G2). (2.47)
Proof.BytheMarkovproperty,wemayreplace FbyE(F|q(a)) andGbyE(G|q(b))
without aﬀecting the LHS(2.47). This change may aﬀect the RHS(2.4 7), but only
by making it smaller. These observations reduce the question to con sideration of
random variables F=f(q(a)) andG=g(q(b)).INVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 19
For such random variables, the joint marginals (2.17) show
LHS(2.47) =/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay/integraldisplay

ψ0(y′)g(y′)dydy′/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle.
The spectral theory of the operator Ldiscussed earlier now guarantees that the
quantity in square brackets is the integral kernel of an operator of norme−(b−a)λ1
and consequently,
LHS(2.47) ≤e−λ1(b−a)/ba∇dblfψ0/ba∇dblL2(R)/ba∇dblgψ0/ba∇dblL2(R)= RHS(2.47) . /square
This lemma already captures the intuitive notion of mixing that when ob served
on widely separated regions of space, a single sample from the Gibbs s tate yields
seemingly independent observations. The true deﬁnition of mixing, h owever, re-
quires us to consider more general pairs of measurable events. Re call that we are
employing the Borel σ-algebra associated with the compact-open topology, which
is also theσ-algebra generated by cylinder sets.
Corollary 2.11. The inﬁnite-volume Gibbs state is mixing under translation s.
Proof.Suppose ﬁrst that AandBare cylinder subsets of C(R), which means that
they are determined by the value of the function at ﬁnitely many poin ts. Then
Lemma 2.10 shows that
(2.48)P/parenleftBig
q(·)∈A&q(·−x)∈B/parenrightBig
−→P/parenleftbig
q(·)∈A/parenrightbig
P/parenleftbig
q(·)∈B/parenrightbig
as|x| → ∞.
Observe now that for ﬁxed cylinder set B, the collection of sets Afor which
(2.48) holds is a λsystem which contains the cylinder sets (a πsystem). Thus by
theπ-λTheorem, convergence holds for all measurable A. Likewise, we see that
for each measurable A, convergence holds not only for cylinder sets Bbut for all
measurable B. This shows that qis mixing. /square
Recall that mixing implies ergodicity. Next we use this to show that no d istinct
pairs of temperature and chemical potential lead to absolutely con tinuous Gibbs
states; rather, they are mutually singular. Recall that we previou sly used the
scaling (2.1) to normalize the temperature and so simplify the presen tation. From
this perspective, we see that changes in chemical potential are no t be reversed by
rescaling.
Corollary 2.12. The Gibbs states corresponding to diﬀerent chemical potent ials
and/or temperatures are mutually singular.
Proof.From our previous discussion, we know that the stationary distribu tion for
the inﬁnite-volume Gibbs state at inverse temperature βand chemical potential µ
is given by the measure ψ(y)2dywhereψis theL2-normalized ground state of the
Schr¨ odinger operator

As no two such ground states agree, nor do any two stationary dis tributions.
Given pairs ( β1,µ1) and (β2,µ2) that arenot identical, we may choosea function
f∈C∞
c(R) that witnesses the distinction between the two stationary distrib utions
in the following way:

2.4.The inﬁnite-volume Gibbs state as a diﬀusion. In the introduction, we
mentioned the connection between the inﬁnite-volume Gibbs state a nd solutions
of the stochastic diﬀerential equation (1.8). This is quite a departu re from the
manner in which we deﬁned Gibbs measure. In this short subsection, we explain
this connection using the martingale characterization of diﬀusions c hampioned in
[45]. This characterization will help us better describe the regularity properties
both of the Gibbs samples q(x) and of their image under the Miura map.
In the language of diﬀusions, (1.8) says that q(x) has diﬀusivity a(y)≡1 and
driftb(y) =ψ′
0(y)/ψ0(y). Asψ0is the ground state of Schr¨ odinger operator (2.2),
we see that b(y) is smooth and odd; moreover, b(y) =−y2+µ
2+o(1) asy→+∞.
Such a diﬀusion is characterized by the fact that for every f∈C∞
c(R), the process

As we already know that q(x) is a Markov process, it is enough to verify the
following:

The key observation is that Lψ0= 0 implies that
/bracketleftbig1

(y)·ψ0(y) =−L[fψ0](y).

Proof.In view of the bounds (2.19), a simple limiting argument allows us to take
f(y) =yandf(y) =y2in (2.50).
The choice f(y) =yshows that B(x) is a martingale. Combining this with
the result for f(y) =y2, a short computation shows that B(x)2−xis also a
martingale. Noting that B(x) has continuous sample paths, it follows from L´ evy’s
characterization (cf. [44, §7.1]) thatB(x) is a Brownian motion. /square
It follows from (2.53) that q(x) diﬀers from Brownian motion by a (random) C1
function, which justiﬁes the remark made in the introduction that s amplesq(x)
have the same regularity as Brownian paths. In particular, we see t hatq(x) is not
of bounded variation on any interval because Brownian motion is not of bounded
variation on any interval.
3.Lax operators, Green’s functions, and approximating flows
We begin by developing a deterministic theory of the Lax operator
L=L0+QwithL0=/bracketleftbigg−∂0
0∂/bracketrightbigg
andQ=/bracketleftbigg0q
−q0/bracketrightbigg
(3.1)
whereqis real-valued and satisﬁes
(3.2) /an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht−bq(x)∈L2(R)
for someb >0. This includes the two regimes of greatest interest to us, namely,
periodic and whole-line Gibbs distributed q; indeed, (2.18) shows that (3.2) holds
(almost surely) whenever b>1
2.
The natural domain for L0isH1(R;C2). Moreover, it is elementary to see that
this yields an anti-selfadjoint operator, which is to say, iL0is selfadjoint. We deﬁne
a corresponding free resolvent via
R0(κ) = (L0+κ)−1=/bracketleftbigg(κ−∂)−10
0 (κ+∂)−1/bracketrightbigg
; (3.3)
here and in all that follows, we shall only need to consider those
(3.4) κ∈Rthat satisfy |κ| ≥1.
The free resolvent admits an integral kernel, namely, the free Gre en’s function
G0(x,y;κ) = sign(κ)e−|κ||x−y|/bracketleftBigg
1(0,∞)(κ[y−x]) 0

. (3.5)
The two indicator functions are chosen not to overlap on the null se t{x=y}so
that tr{G0(x,y;κ)} ≡sign(κ), irrespective of x,y∈R.

Forκas in(3.4), the Green’s function G(x,y;κ), which serves as the integral
kernel for the resolvent R(κ) = (L+κ)−1, has the property that
G(x,y;κ)−G0(x,y;κ) (3.7)
is a continuous function of (x,y)∈R2, real-analytic in κ, and

Proof.Let us write lfor the operator given by (3.1) with domain C∞
c(R;C2). It is
not diﬃcult to verify that lis anti-symmetric and that the domain of its adjoint l∗
is the set given in (3.6). In a moment, we will show that l∗is anti-symmetric. By
general arguments, it then follows that l∗∗, which is the closure of l, coincides with
−l∗. This veriﬁes all the claims made in the ﬁrst paragraph.
To show that l∗is anti-symmetric, let/bracketleftbigφ

TheH1
locregularity of the four functions φ,ψ,ϕ,θ was essential here; the ﬁnal
conditions in (3.6) guarantee that the integrand on the left-hand s ide is actually
L1. Moreover, as all four functions belong to L2, we may send aandbto±∞
and see that the integral over the full line vanishes. This precisely s hows that l∗is
anti-symmetric.
We turn now to the discussion of Green’s functions. From the explicit form (3.5)
and the elementary inequality /an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/lessorsimilar/an}b∇acketle{ty/an}b∇acket∇i}ht/an}b∇acketle{tx−y/an}b∇acket∇i}ht, we ﬁnd that for each b∈R,

From this, we deduce easily that
/ba∇dblQR0(κ)δy/ba∇dblL2/lessorsimilarb/an}b∇acketle{ty/an}b∇acket∇i}htb/ba∇dbl/an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht−bq(x)/ba∇dblL2 (3.10)
and also that the map y/ma√sto→QR0(κ)δyisL2-continuous and depends analytically
onκ. Likewise, y/ma√sto→R0(κ)δyis an analytic function of κthat isL2-continuous and
/ba∇dblR0(κ)δy/ba∇dblL2/lessorsimilarκ−1/2. (3.11)
In this way, the claims made about the function (3.7), including the bo und (3.8),
follow from the resolvent expansion
/square (3.12) R(κ)−R0(κ) =−R0(κ)QR0(κ)+R0(κ)QR(κ)QR0(κ).
From (2.19), we see that periodic Gibbs samples are almost surely bou nded. For
suchq∈L∞(R), the domain of Lsimpliﬁes to just H1(R;C2). In the inﬁnite-
volume case, however, Gibbs samples are almost surely unbounded ( this follows
from ergodicity) and correspondingly, the domain given in (3.6) genu inely depends
onq: it is random!
Our proof that Lis anti-selfadjoint was inspired by arguments in [27]. It did not
rely on the speciﬁc growth condition (3.2), but merely that qis square-integrable
on every ﬁnite interval. The fact that the Dirac-type operator iLcan be essentially
selfadjoint without growth restrictions on the potential marks a s triking departure
from the case of Schr¨ odinger operators. The physical origin of t his distinction was
elegantly articulated in [7]: the relativistic speed limit inherent to Dirac o perators
ensures that the quantum particle cannot reach inﬁnity in ﬁnite time .INVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 23
For much of our analysis, the range of κpresented in (3.4) can be reduced to
simplyκ≥1 by virtue of the following symmetry:
(3.13) −L=L∗=σ1Lσ1and so R(−κ) =−R(κ)∗=−σ1R(κ)σ1.
Hereσ1denotes the ﬁrst of the three Pauli matrices; indeed,
(3.14) L=iqσ2−σ3∂, σ1:=/bracketleftbig0 1

, σ2:=/bracketleftbig0−i

.
Pointwise bounds on the Green’s function such as (3.8) can also be int erpreted
as (weighted) L1→L∞bounds on the resolvent; such bounds will be an important
part of the subsequent analysis.
Another key ingredient in our analysis is oﬀ-diagonal decay of the Gr een’s func-
tion. Thereisarobustmeansofobtainingsuchdecay, namely, theC ombes–Thomas
argument. For the operators we study, this argument leads us to the particularly
elegant result stated next. Notice that the estimate (3.15) holds w ith a constant
that is independent of the potential. This plays a major role in allowing u s to avoid
the full complexity of a multiscale analysis in this paper.

3.1.Diagonal Green’s functions. In this subsection, we consider the behaviour
of the (matrix) Green’s function G(x,y) at the conﬂuence of xandy. We continue
to consider general qsatisfying (3.2).
From (3.5) we see that even when q≡0, the Green’s function has a jump discon-
tinuityatthediagonal; nevertheless,thecontinuitydemonstrate dinProposition3.1
and the diagonal characterof G0allow us to deﬁne continuous real-valued functions
γ(x;κ) := [G−G0]11(x,x;κ)+[G−G0]22(x,x;κ), (3.19)
g−(x;κ) :=G21(x,x;κ)−G12(x,x;κ), (3.20)
g+(x;κ) :=G21(x,x;κ)+G12(x,x;κ). (3.21)
Here, the numerical subscripts indicate matrix entries. By (3.13), these functions
satisfy the following symmetries
g−(−κ) =g−(κ), g+(−κ) =−g+(κ),andγ(−κ) =−γ(κ). (3.22)
At ﬁrst glance, it may seem we are omitting information: the Green’s m atrix
has four entries and we have only deﬁned three functions. Howeve r, by (3.13),
[G−G0]11(x,x;κ) = [G−G0]22(x,x;κ).
In fact, there is one further constraint on the diagonal Green’s f unction, namely,
(3.29). This and other foundational facts about our three funct ionsγandg±form
the centerpiece of this subsection.

Moreover, Schur’s test and the explicit form (3.5) show that the op erator in square

reduced to the case where b= 0.

provided already in (3.33).
It remains to prove (3.29) and (3.30). We begin with the former, whic h is
elementary once we prove the following more general fact:
detG(x,y) = 0 for all x/ne}ationslash=y. (3.41)
To see this, observe that (3.35) implies that this determinant must b e constant in
each connected component of x/ne}ationslash=y. On the other hand, if one ﬁxes xand sends
y→ ±∞, then (3.16) shows that the matrix (and so also its determinant) co nverges
to zero.
Lastly, we prove the ﬁrst inequality in (3.30). As Lis anti-selfadjoint, so

Although an L2-based theory will suﬃce for us, we wish to make a few brief
comments on how one may transfer additional regularity of qto the diagonal
Green’s functions. One approach is via (3.36), noting that γis already signiﬁ-
cantly smoother than q; see (3.23). An alternate approach is to use the bounds of
Proposition 3.6 with q2being a small translate of q1. This works well not only with
H¨ older spaces, but also in Ws,pspaces through the Besov characterization.
3.2.The periodic case. Thus far, our analysis of the Green’s function has as-
sumed the mild hypothesis (3.2). When b >1
2, this covers the case of periodic
potentialsq∈L2(TL).
The central result of this subsection is Lipschitz bounds for γandg±in the peri-
odic setting that will allow us to construct solutions to the Hκﬂow via contraction
mapping. Size will be measured using the one-period L2norm. As it does not aﬀect
the arguments, we will allow L=∞; however, such q∈L2(R) will ultimately have
no role in this paper. Indeed, for samples from the Gibbs state, the L2(TL) norm
divergesas L→ ∞. Correspondingly, these periodic estimates do not suﬃce for the28 J. FORLANO, R. KILLIP, AND M. VIS ¸AN
analysis of the Gibbs state in the L→ ∞limit. A proper quantitative treatment
of that case will be taken up in Section 5.
Asg+,g−, andγall vanish when q≡0, specializing the Lipschitz estimates
below toq2≡0 yields norm bounds.

y1+h,y2+h;κ,q/parenrightbig
=G/parenleftbig
y1,y2;κ,q(·+h)/parenrightbig
(3.54)
and correspondingly, it suﬃces to consider the case y1= 0 (with a translated
potential). We then see that (3.50) follows by choosing b >1
2in (3.43) together
with two further observations: First, the slight deterioration in th e exponential
decay between (3.43) and (3.50) allows us to absorb the factor /an}b∇acketle{ty2/an}b∇acket∇i}ht5b/2. Second, as

and an analogous result for H2
κ(TL). Using such relations, we can then derive
(3.51), (3.52), and (3.53) from their corresponding counterpart s in Proposition 3.4.
We will illustrate the method using (3.51) as our example.

Let us turn ﬁnally to the question of analyticity. Recall κ/ma√sto→G(y1,y2;κ,q) was
shown to be analytic in Proposition 3.1 using the resolvent identity (3.1 2). In order
to adapt that argument to joint analyticity, it suﬃces to show that (κ,q)/ma√sto→R(κ,q)
is jointly analytic (with values in the space of bounded operators).
The resolvent identity allows us to write

The functionals A(κ),A(κ), andMall Poisson commute throughout L2(TL)for
anyκ,κ≥1; moreover, A(κ)commutes with the Hamiltonian HmKdVthroughout
H1(TL).
Proof.The inequality (3.30) shows that 2 + γ≥1. Together with the other es-
timates of Proposition 3.7, this guarantees that the integrand in (3 .59) is indeed
absolutely integrable. The joint analyticity of A(κ,q) follows from the analyticity
of the Green’s function shown there.
To proceed, we need the following important identity discovered in [1 4]:

We do not repeat the proof. It is involved; however, it relies only on a lgebraic
manipulations of the identities presented in Proposition 3.4 and their κ-derivatives.
Integrating both sides over one period conﬁrms the left identity in ( 3.60). Our
next goal is to use this identity to understandδ

∂κ.
Consider the directional derivative in the direction f∈L2(TL). Using the left
identity in (3.60), (3.54), and the periodicity of fandq, we ﬁnd that

Evidently, the second identity in (3.60) should follow by integrating bo th sides of
(3.62) withrespectto κ. Oneneedonlyshowthatthereisnoboundarycontribution

as can be seen from (3.51) and (3.53).
Next we verify commutativity under the Poisson structure deﬁned in (1.2). As
a ﬁrst example, we combine (3.60), (3.26), and (3.28) to obtain
{M,A(κ)}=/integraldisplay

which is easily veriﬁed by combining (3.26), (3.27), and (3.28).
In a similar fashion, (3.26), (3.27), and (3.28) imply

which then demonstrates that {HmKdV,A(κ)}= 0. /square
The Poisson commutativity of A(κ;q) andHmKdVshows that A(κ;q) is con-
served under (mKdV). In [14], for example, this was crucial for co ntrolling the
low-regularity norms of solutions to (mKdV). As samples of the ﬁnite -volume
Gibbs state are in L2(TL), we may exploit conservation of M(q) for this role.
In this paper, the principal role of the Poisson commutativity of A(κ;q) and
HmKdVis ensuring that the (mKdV) ﬂow commutes with the approximate ﬂow
that we will be employing. Our approximate ﬂows are based on the Ham iltonians
Hκ(q) := 4κ2M(q)−4κ3A(κ;q). (3.65)INVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 31
Proposition 3.8 ensures that these Poisson commute with HmKdV. Let us now
present the basic properties of the ﬂows generated by Hκ(q):
Proposition 3.9. Fix1≤L≤ ∞andκ≥1. Then the Hamiltonian ﬂow induced
byHκ, namely,
d
dtq(x) =∂x{4κ2q−4κ3g−(κ)}= 4κ2q′(x)+8κ4g+(x;κ), (3.66)
is globally well-posed on L2(TL). This evolution preserves M(q)andA(κ;q)for all
κ≥1and commutes with the Hκﬂow. Moreover, under this ﬂow,

for any distinct κ,κ≥1.
Proof.The formulas for the Hκﬂow follow from (3.60) and then (3.28). To prove
well-posedness of this ﬂow, we ﬁrst formulate the problem as the int egral equation
q(t,x) =q(0,x+4κ2t)+8κ4/integraldisplayt
0g+(x+4κ2(t−t′);κ,q(t′))dt, (3.70)
which corresponds to treating (3.66) as a perturbation of the tra nslation ﬂow with
Hamiltonian 4 κ2M(q). From (3.51), we know that q/ma√sto→g+isL2-Lipschitz and so
well-posedness follows easily from contraction mapping.
Global well-posedness then follows from the conservation of M(q), which is a
consequence of Proposition 3.8 or can be deduced by direct comput ation using
(3.26). Likewise, the conservation of A(κ) follows from Proposition 3.8.
The commutativity of the HκandHκﬂows is easily checked for smooth data.
This extends to all of L2(TL) via well-posedness.
The derivationofthe evolutionequations forthe diagonalGreen’sf unctions from
ﬁrst principles is rather lengthy. However, these results can be de duced directly
from [14, Corollary 4.8]. We caution the reader that the regularized H amiltonian
used here and in [14] are diﬀerent because the Poisson structures are diﬀerent;
however, the evolution (3.66) under discussion here is indeed the sp ecialization of
the ﬂow studied in [14] to real initial data. /square
As discussed in the Introduction, our approach to treating (mKdV ) in the ther-
modynamic limit rests on ﬁrst extending the Hκﬂow to the full line and then
sendingκ→ ∞. Toward this goal, we will verify that the Hκﬂow preserves the
ﬁnite-volume Gibbs state in the next section. As a small detour, we w ill also show
how our approach leads to a new proof of invariance of the ﬁnite-vo lume Gibbs
state under (mKdV) dynamics. The existence of solutions for such initial data fol-
lows easily from the well-posedness of (mKdV) in L2(TL), which was ﬁrst proved
in [18]. Our future arguments, however, rely on the fact that the Hκﬂows converge
to (mKdV) as κ→ ∞. This was proved in [10] as a key part of providing a new
proof that (mKdV) is well-posed in L2(TL).32 J. FORLANO, R. KILLIP, AND M. VIS ¸AN
Theorem 3.10 ([10, 18]) .The(mKdV) ﬂow is globally well-posed in L2(TL)and
it commutes with the Hκﬂow. Moreover, for ﬁxed q0∈L2(TL)andT >0,

L2(TL)= 0. (3.71)
A key ingredient in the argument in [10] is to make a diﬀeomorphic chan ge of
unknown (= gauge transformation). This is to overcome the diﬃcult y that the
nonlinearity in (mKdV) does not make sense (as a distribution) pointw ise in time
forCtL2
xsolutions. Convergence in (3.71) is actually deduced from converge nce of
the gauge variable g−, whose evolution under the Hκﬂow was presented in (3.68).
Under the (mKdV) ﬂow, the diagonal Green’s functions evolve as fo llows:

As well as playing an important role in the proof of Theorem 3.10, thes e formulae
also allow us to give an intrinsic deﬁnition of what it means for a wide class of
low-regularity functions to be solutions of (mKdV):
Deﬁnition 3.11. Suppose /an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht−bq(t,x) isL2

in the sense of distributions.
The estimate (3.25) together with the well-known embedding H1֒→L∞and its
dualL1֒→H−1ensure that RHS(3.75) belongs to H−1
loc(R) and so is certainly a
distribution. Similarly, (3.23) ensures that RHS(3.76) belongs to H−2
loc(R).
There is no reason to demand that green solutions satisfy a parallel identity
corresponding to (3.72), since this can be derived from (3.75) by ta king a spatial
derivative and using (3.28).
We include (3.76) in our deﬁnition for an important reason: The funct ionγ(κ)
serves as a one-parameter family of microscopic conservation laws for (mKdV), as
(3.74) demonstrates; correspondingly, green solutions retain th is important expres-
sion of complete integrability. Indeed, the name of this type of solut ion was chosen
to reﬂect this double meaning: green in the sense of Green’s functio n, but also in
the sense of conservationism. For comparison, the notion of solut ion introduced in
[8] allows for non-conservative solutions of completely integrable sy stems.
In Section 7, we will describe the notion of green solution appropriat e to (KdV),
which was introduced already in [22].
4.Invariance of the periodic Gibbs measure
At the conclusion of this section, we provide a new proof of the invar iance of
the Gibbs measure under (mKdV) on TLfor ﬁniteL. Our proof relies on the
invariance of this measure under the Hκﬂow; this also plays a central role in the
inﬁnite-volume analysis.INVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 33

As the reader may well intuit, the uniformity in Lexpressed in (4.1) will allow
us to send L→ ∞in the next section. The limit will then inherit these bounds.
The uniformity in κwill then be exploited to send κ→ ∞in Section 6.
We will break the proof of Theorem 4.1 into two parts, verifying part s (a) and
(b) ﬁrst and then returning to part (c) later, after Lemma 4.2. No te that part (c)
is unnecessary for proving invariance of the Gibbs state under (mK dV) in ﬁnite
volume; moreover, our insistence on uniformity in κandLmakes the proof of this
part somewhat involved.
Proof of (a)and(b).Letq0be Gibbs distributed on TL. Asq0∈L2almost surely,
Proposition 3.9 guarantees the existence of a global Hκevolutionq(t) =etJ∇Hκq0.
Suppose, towards a contradiction, that the Gibbs measure is not in variant under
theHκﬂow. Then, there is a φ∈C∞(TL), a timeT >0, and aB >0 so that

HereχB(q) =χ(M(q)/B) andχ∈C∞
csatisﬁesχ(x) = 1 for |x| ≤1 andχ(x) = 0
for|x| ≥2. Notice that this construction guarantees
(4.3) χB(q)·χ2B(q)≡χB(q) andχB(q)·δ

which combines the Hκﬂow map with translation. Translation invariance of the

We wish to reach a contradiction by proving that

We consider the combined Hκand translation ﬂows here for the same reason we
did in the proofofProposition3.9, namely, L2well-posednessis a direct application
of the Cauchy–Peanocontraction mapping argument. This argume nt shows that G
is aC1function of time and of the initial data; moreover,

The combined Hκand translation ﬂow has Hamiltonian −4κ3A(κ,q). This is
real-analytic and from (3.30), (3.60), and (3.51), we see that

In order to apply Theorem 2.6, we must ensure that (2.37) holds. Fo r this reason,
we introduce a further cut-oﬀ, deﬁning F(q) :=χ2B(q)A(κ;q).
Combining the above deﬁnitions with (4.3) and (3.60), we ﬁnd that LHS (2.38)

In view of (4.6) and (3.51), this quantity converges to LHS(4.7) as N→ ∞. Thus,
our goalhas become to show that this limit is zero, or equivalently, by Theorem 2.6,
to show that

Next, let us clarify what we will mean by a solution of the Hκﬂow in inﬁnite
volume. To this end, we introduce some notations:

We shall only be employing χLwhenL∈2N∪{∞}. Similarly, we only consider
(s,p,b) with 0 ≤s<1
2,1≤p<∞andb>1

this ensures that Gibbs samples belong to Ws,p

Deﬁnition 5.1 (Good solution) .Fixκ≥1. We say that q:R→L2
1is agood
solution of theHκﬂow if it is continuous,
q(t,x) =q(0,x+4κ2t)+8κ4/integraldisplayt

Notice that good solutions are, by deﬁnition, globalsolutions. Also, if q(t) is a
goodsolution, thensotoois t/ma√sto→q(t+τ) foranyτ∈R. AsqisL2

guarantees that both sides of (5.3) can equivalently be interprete d as elements of
the spaceL2
3(rather than merely almost everywhere).
Theorem 5.2. Givenκ∈2N, there is a subset Gκ⊆L2
1(R)of full Gibbs measure
and a measure-preserving group Φκ:R×Gκ→ Gκwith the following properties:
(a)For eachq∗∈ Gκ, the orbitq(t) := Φκ(t,q∗)is a good solution of the Hκﬂow.
(b)The diagonal Green functions satisfy (3.67),(3.68), and(3.69).

The proof of this theorem is given at the end of the section and rest s on two

As we will observe during the Proof of Theorem 5.2, the fact that q0
Lsatisfy
(5.1) ensures that they also satisfy (5.8). However, we need the g reater generality
presented here in order to handle questions of commutativity. Not ice also that
ﬁxing some time t∈R, the conclusion (5.9) can be used to see that qL(t) verify the
hypothesis (5.8), albeit for a diﬀerent η. In this way, qL(t) can be used as initial
data for the Hκﬂow (with κ/ne}ationslash=κ).

Evidently, Lemma 5.4 gives a very mild form of convergence of the qL(t) as
t→ ∞. We now substantially upgrade this:INVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 39
Proposition 5.5 (Inﬁnite-volume limits) .Letη >0be given, along with Gibbs-
distributed processes q1
L(x),L∈2N, that satisfy (5.8). For eachκ∈2N, letqL(t;κ)

for everyκ,T∈2N, the sequence qL(t;κ)converges in Ct([−T,T];L2

The processes q∞(t;κ)deﬁned as these limits are Gibbs distributed at every t∈R
and are almost surely good solutions of the Hκﬂow. Moreover, for each triple (5.2),
there is an α=α(s,p,b)>0so that

This guarantees the almost sure convergence of qL(t;κ) inCt([−T,T];L2

As there are only countably many choices, we immediately deduce simu ltaneous
convergence for allκ,T∈2Nalso holds with probability one.

b). Then
applying (5.18) once again, we obtain (5.17).
Recall that the ﬁnite-volume Gibbs distributions converge to the inﬁ nite volume
Gibbs distribution as L→ ∞. Moreover, from Theorem 4.1, we know that qL(t;κ)
are Gibbs distributed on TLfor everyκ,L∈2N. As we have shown that these
random variables converge almost surely in L2
1toq∞(t;κ), it follows that q∞(t;κ)
is Gibbs distributed in inﬁnite volume.
It remains to verify that q∞(t;κ) is almost surely a good solution. The ﬁnite-
volume solutions qL(t;κ) satisfy the integral equation (5.3) by construction. Con-
vergence in Ct([−T,T];L2
1) and (3.44) extend this to the inﬁnite-volume case.
Asq∞(t) is always Gibbs distributed, Proposition 2.2 and Lemma 5.3 show that

Let us now demonstrate the uniqueness of good solutions, building o n ideas
introduced already in Lemma 5.4.
Proposition 5.6 (Uniqueness of good solutions) .Fixκ≥1. For each initial data
inL2
1there is at most one good solution to the Hκﬂow.
Proof.Letqand ˜qdenote two good solutions with the same initial data. We seek
to control
d(t) =/ba∇dble−/angb∇acketleftx/angb∇acket∇ightα[q(t)−˜q(t)]/ba∇dbl2

over any interval [ −T,T] via Gronwall’s inequality. Evidently, d(0) = 0.
Tocontrolthediﬀerencebetween g+(t,x) :=g+(x;κ,q(t))and ˜g+:=g+(x;κ,˜q(t)),
we will generalize some of the arguments used to prove Lemma 5.4. Re call (5.11):

.
To estimate the right-hand side, we employ (5.12) and (3.18) exactly as before,
but need new estimates for the remaining two operators. In order to obtain such
estimates, we will use the following partition of unity:
1 =χL+/summationdisplay
[χ2ℓ−χℓ] where summation is over ℓ∈L2N. (5.19)

Next we consider the operator QR[Q−˜Q]e−/angb∇acketleftx/angb∇acket∇ightα, which we also need to bound in
Hilbert–Schmidt norm. We expand this operator by placing the partit ion of unity
(5.19) to the right of Rand to its left, we place the analogue starting at length
scale 2L. We estimate the ﬁrst such term thus:

Proof of Theorem 5.2. Fixκ∈2N. For eachL∈2N, let us write Φ κ,Lfor the one-
parameter group of homeomorphisms on L2(TL) deﬁned by the Hκﬂow. Recall
that each of these preserves Gibbs measure on TL.
We deﬁne Gκas the set of those q∗
∞∈L2
1for which there is a sequence q∗
L∈
L2(TL) meeting both of the following criteria: (i) For all T∈2N, the sequence
Φκ,L(t,q∗
L) converges in C([−T,T];L2
1) (5.22)
asL→ ∞; (ii) The limit function is a good solution of the Hκﬂow. (We use the ∗
superscript to distinguish these initial data from the random variab lesq0
L).
We then deﬁne Φ κ:R×Gκ→L2
1as the limiting function. Proposition 5.6 guar-
antees that this function is well-deﬁned, which is to say, the trajec tory is uniquely
determined by the initial data (irrespective of which sequence lead t o it).
In fact, Φ κtakes values in Gκ. To see this, we note that all our criteria are
invariant under time translation. In a similar vein, we see that Φ κinherits the
group property from the fact that it is true in ﬁnite volume.42 J. FORLANO, R. KILLIP, AND M. VIS ¸AN
The Lipschitz dependence demonstrated in Proposition3.6 showsth at the evolu-
tion equations for the diagonal Green’s functions presented in Pro position 3.9 carry
over to the inﬁnite volume setting. This veriﬁes part (b).

and consequently, the processes q0
Lsatisfy (5.8) with η=1
8.
LetqL(t;κ) denote the (unique and global) solution to the Hκﬂow with initial
dataq0
L. According to Proposition 5.5, there is an event Eof full probability on
which all of the following happen: (i) The sequence qL(t;κ) converges in CtL2
1
uniformly on compact time intervals; (ii) The limit q∞(t;κ) is a good solution of
theHκﬂow; (iii) For every triple (5.2), the curves q∞(t;κ) areWs,p
bcontinuous.
There is one small wrinkle in this argument: there are uncountably ma ny triples
(5.2) so one cannot just take an intersection based on (5.17). How ever, by the
imbedding properties of these spaces, we need only consider ration al triples; this
ensures the intersection has full measure.
LetG0denote the image under q0
∞of the event E. Evidently, G0⊂ GκandG0
has full measure. Thus Gκhas full measure.
By uniqueness of good solutions, q∞(t;κ)≡Φκ(t,q0
∞) onE. In this way, we see
that (5.5) is a consequence of (5.17) and that the measure-prese rving property of
Φκfollows from the fact that q∞(t;κ) is Gibbs distributed for all t∈R. /square
Lemma 5.7. Fixκ∈2Nand letq0
∞be Gibbs distributed. Then there is a random
processq:R→L2
1that is almost surely continuous and satisﬁes:
(a)For eacht∈R,q(t) = Φ2κ/parenleftbig

, almost surely.
(b)q(t)is Gibbs distributed at each t∈R.
(c)q(t)is a solution of the H2κ−Hκﬂow in the sense that
q(t) =e12tκ2∂xq0
∞+8κ4/integraldisplayt
0e12tκ2∂x[16g+(2κ,q(s))−g+(κ,q(s))]ds. (5.24)
Proof.By augmenting the probability space, if necessary, we may introduc e Gibbs
distributed processes q0
Lfor eachL∈2N∪ {∞}that are coupled to q0
∞as in
Proposition 2.7.
The natural ﬁnite-volume analogue of (5.24) is
qL(t) =e12tκ2∂xq0
L+8κ4/integraldisplayt
0e12tκ2∂x[16g+(2κ,qL(s))−g+(κ,qL(s))]ds. (5.25)
For almost every sample q0
L, this is easily solved (uniquely and globally) by the
same contraction mapping argument used to prove Proposition 3.9; indeed, one
just employs the Lipschitz estimates of Proposition 3.7. Clearly, qL:R→L2
1isINVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 43
almost surely continuous; moreover, by commutativity of ﬂows,
qL(t) = Φ2κ,L(t)◦Φκ,L(−t,q0
L). (5.26)
This also shows, by Theorem 4.1, that qL(t) is Gibbs distributed for every t∈R.
One may then show that qL(t) converges, almost surely, in Ct([−T,T];L2
1) by
repeating the ﬁrst paragraph of the proof of Proposition 5.5. This requires the
following mild form of (4.1):

All the details necessary to establish (5.27) appear already in the Pr oof of Theo-
rem 4.1(c); indeed, one may just estimate the vector ﬁeld for the H2κ−Hκﬂow via
the triangle inequality and the estimates given there for a single Hκﬂow.
We deﬁneq(t) as the (almost sure) limit of qL(t). Continuity, as well as claims
(b) and (c) follow immediately. It remains to verify (a).
Recall that Gκand Φκwere deﬁned via ﬁnite-volume limits. In particular, after
verifying in (5.23) that q0
Lsatisfy (5.8) with η=1
8, we applied Proposition 5.5 to
deduce that
q0
∞∈ Gκand lim
L→∞Φκ,L(−t,q0

both hold with probability one. To derive (a), we apply the same argum ent to the
sequence Φ κ,L(−t,q0
L), which converges to Φ κ(−t,q0
∞): By (5.23) and Lemma 5.4,
the sequence Φ κ,L(−t,q0
L) also satisﬁes (5.8), with some η >0. Thus, applying
Proposition 5.5 in the same manner, we conclude that
Φκ(−t,q0
∞)∈ G2κandq(t) = lim
L→∞qL(t) = Φ2κ(t)◦Φκ(−t,q0

both hold with probability one. /square
6.Dynamics and invariance for mKdV in infinite volume
As we will be working solely in inﬁnite volume, we may revert to a much simp ler
probabilistic set-up, with just one process q0
∞which is Gibbs distributed on R.
Dynamics with initial data q0
∞will be constructed as the κ→ ∞limit of the
inﬁnite-volume Hκﬂow maps Φ κdescribed by Theorem 5.2. As there, we shall
only consider κ∈2N:
Theorem 6.1 (Dynamics of the inﬁnite-volume Gibbs state) .
With probability one, the sequence of trajectories Φκ(t,q0
∞)converges, as κ→ ∞,
inCt([−T,T];Ws,p
b)for everyT∈2Nand every triple (5.2). This almost sure limit
deﬁnes a measure-preserving group, whose orbits q(t) := Φ(t,q0
∞)satisfy
(a)Almost surely, q(t)is a distributional solution to (mKdV).
(b)Almost surely, q(t)is a green solution to (mKdV); see Deﬁnition 3.11.

The group property of the transformations Φ constructed here is this:
(6.2) Φ( t+s,q) = Φ(t)◦Φ(s,q) almost surely.
In Theorem 5.2, by contrast, there were no exceptional null sets . For all practical
purposes, the two notions of measure-preserving group are equ ivalent; see [28] and
the earlier work referenced therein. This minor nuisance arises pre cisely from the
uncountablitity of the set of times t. Our ﬁrst lemma shows that the almost-
sure limit of measure-preserving groups (in the sense (6.2)) is likewis e a measure
preserving group.
Lemma 6.2. LetQbe a Polish space which is endowed with a Borel probability
measure. For each κ∈2N, letΦκ:R×Q→Qbe a one-parameter group of
measure preserving transformations. Suppose that for each t∈R, the sequence
Φκ(t,q)converges almost surely (asκ→ ∞)and letΦ(t,q)denote the limiting
function. Then Φ :R×Q→Qis a one-parameter group of measure-preserving
transformations of Q.
Proof.The fact that Φ( t) must also be measure-preserving is elementary: For any
bounded continuous function F:Q→R, the dominated convergence theorem
shows
E/braceleftbig
F◦Φ(t,q)/bracerightbig
= lim
κ→∞E/braceleftbig
F◦Φκ(t,q)/bracerightbig
=E/braceleftbig

.
In a similar vein, we may verify (6.2) by proving that
E/braceleftbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingleF◦Φ(t)◦Φ(s,q)−F◦Φ(t+s,q)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/bracerightbig
= 0 (6.3)
for any bounded continuous function F:Q→R. Evidently, for any κ∈2N,
LHS(6.3) ≤E/braceleftbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingleF◦Φ(t)◦Φ(s,q)−F◦Φ(t)◦Φκ(s,q)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/bracerightbig

(6.4)
+E/braceleftbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingleF◦Φκ(t+s,q)−F◦Φ(t+s,q)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/bracerightbig
.
Our goal is to show that each term here vanishes in the limit κ→ ∞. For the
last term this is immediate from the dominated convergence theorem . The middle
term may be treated likewise after ﬁrst exploiting the measure-pre serving property
of Φκ(s). The ﬁrst term in RHS(6.4) requires a little more discussion.
We apply Lusin’s theorem to the bounded measurable function F◦Φ(t,q): For
everyε>0, there is a bounded continuous function Fε:Q→Rso that
E{|F◦Φ(t,q)−Fε(q)|}<ε.
From this observation, the measure preserving property of both Φ and Φκ, as well
as the dominated convergence theorem, we ﬁnd that
limsup
κ→∞E/braceleftbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingleF◦Φ(t)◦Φ(s,q)−F◦Φ(t)◦Φκ(s,q)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/bracerightbig

with an implicit constant that is independent of κ.
Proof.Fixt. As Φκ(t,q0
∞) is Gibbs distributed, Lemma 5.7 guaranteesthat, almost
surely, one may ﬁnd a solution q(s) to (5.24) with
q(t) := Φ 2κ(t)◦Φκ(−t,q(0)) and q(0) = Φκ(t,q0
∞).
Evidently,
Φ2κ(t,q0
∞)−Φκ(t,q0
∞) =q(t)−q(0).
Thus we wish to estimate how far this trajectory moves from its initia l data; this
will be accomplished by estimating the time derivative.
Recall that q(s) is Gibbs distributed for all s∈R. Moreover, we may rewrite
(5.24) as
d
dsq(s) = 4/braceleftbig
3κ2q+κ3g−(κ;q(s))−8κ3g−(2κ;q(s))/bracerightbig′. (6.6)
Commuting the derivative outermost, this shows that our goal of p roving (6.5) has
been reduced to showing that

for any Gibbs-distributed random variable q.
To proceed, it is convenient to split the central quantity into three parts. Using
(3.36) and combining terms, we may write
3κ2q+κ3g−(κ;q)−8κ3g−(2κ;q) =Lin(q)+Nonlin 1(q)+Nonlin 2(q),
where
Lin(q) :=3κ2∂4
(16κ2−∂2)(4κ2−∂2)q,Nonlin 1(q) :=κ2∂2

16κ2−∂2[qγ(2κ)],
and Nonlin 2(q) :=q/bracketleftbig
κ2γ(κ)−4κ2γ(2κ)/bracketrightbig
.
The ﬁrst two terms here can be satisfactorily estimated without ex hibiting any
further cancellation. Performing commutation in the style of (3.33) and then using
the moment bound (2.18), we ﬁnd

These bounds are clearly satisfactory for verifying (6.7).
We now move on to the task of estimating the contribution of Nonlin 2(q) in a

as we will show below. Using H¨ older’s inequality (and the freedom to mo dify both

We estimate these terms one-by-one. In doing so, we note that L1֒→H−1and

Let us now consider the ﬁfth and ﬁnal term in (6.11). Mirroring the p receding

Together these estimates complete our treatment of (6.11).
We turn now to Yκ−Y. From (3.27) and (3.26), we have
γ′′(κ) = 2q′g+(κ)−4κqg−(κ)+4q2[1+γ(κ)]
and consequently,
Y=/braceleftbig
−2q′g+(κ)+2q2[1+γ(κ)]−8κqg−(κ)−12κ2γ(κ)/bracerightbig′. (6.13)
Anticipating the cancellations we need, we regroup and reorder ter ms inYκthus:

.
To proceed, we estimate the diﬀerences of corresponding pairs of terms taken
from (6.13) and (6.14).
Setting aside the common factor of g+(κ), the diﬀerence of the ﬁrst pair of terms
produces the following, which we then rewrite using (3.36):
4κ4(κ2+κ2)
(κ2−κ2)2g+(κ)+2q′=12κ2κ4−4κ2κ4
(κ2−κ2)2g+(κ)−2∂2

Proof of Theorem 6.1. Let us adopt the abbreviation qκ(t) := Φκ(t,q0
∞).
Corollary 6.4 shows that qκ(t) almost surely converges in Ct([−T,T];Ws,p
b) for
anyT >0 and any one triple (5.2). Thus, such convergence holds for all T∈2N
and all rational triples and thence (by imbedding properties of thes e spaces) for all
triples.
This convergence together with Theorem 5.2 and Lemma 6.2 show tha t the lim-
iting family of transformations Φ( t,q) forms a one-parameter group of transforma-
tions preserving Gibbs measure. In particular, q(t) := Φ(t,q0
∞) is Gibbs distributed
at every time.
Combiningtheconvergenceshownearlier,(5.17), andFatou’slemma proves(6.1).
Next we show that q(t) is almost surely a distributional solution. Using (3.36),
we may rewrite the Hκevolution equation as

It remains so verify that q(t) is almost surely a green solution. From Theo-

γ(κ;qκ(t2))−γ(κ;qκ(t1)) =/integraldisplayt2
t1Yκ(κ,qκ(t))dt. (6.17)
Here and below we employ the notations of Lemma 6.5. Our approach is to deduce
thatg−(κ;q(t)) satisﬁes (3.75) and that γ(κ;q(t)) satisﬁes (3.76), almost surely,
by sending κ→ ∞in (6.16) and (6.17), respectively.
Asqκ(t)→q(t), Proposition 3.6 guarantees convergence of the left-hand sides .
It also implies that
X(κ,qκ(t))→X(κ,q(t)) andY(κ,qκ(t))→Y(κ,q(t))
as spacetime distributions, almost surely. This leaves us to show tha t asκ→ ∞,
X(κ,qκ(t))−Xκ(κ,qκ(t))→0 andYκ(κ,qκ(t))−Y(κ,qκ(t))→0 (6.18)
in the same sense. Noting that qκ(t) is Gibbs distributed at all times and recalling
(2.18) and (6.8), Lemma 6.5 implies that
/summationdisplay

and analogously for Yκ(κ,qκ(t))−Y(κ,qκ(t)). This certainly implies (6.18). /square
7.New invariant measures for KdV in infinite volume
The goal of this section is to show that applying the Miura map (7.9) to the
Gibbs-distributedsolutionsto(mKdV) describedin Theorem6.1, wem ayconstruct
new invariant measures for (KdV). We begin our discussion with some of the
relevant operator theory.
The Lax operators pertinent to the (mKdV) equation take the for m of a one-
dimensional Dirac operator. Dirac famously arrived at his model by f actoring
the three-dimensional Schr¨ odinger equation in a manner inspired b y the energy-
momentum relation of Einstein. After a minor change of basis, we will lik ewise see
that the square of Lyields a pair of one-dimensional Schr¨ odinger operators; seeINVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 51
(7.2). The idea of factoring Sturm–Liouville operators as a product of ﬁrst-order
diﬀerentialoperatorsisconsiderablyolder, beginninginthe latenine teenth century;
see [15] for historical references.
The minor change of basis alluded to above is based on the orthogona l matrix

Evidently, O−1=OT=O. Moreover,

−∂+q0/bracketrightbigg
and consequently,
−OL2O=/bracketleftbigg−∂2+q′+q20
0 −∂2−q′+q2/bracketrightbigg
. (7.2)
Recall that Lwasdeﬁned as ananti-selfadjoint operatorin Proposition3.1 under
the mild condition (3.2). This gives meaning to (7.2) as a self-adjoint op erator. We
shall develop the theory of this operator only to the extent that w e need and do so
in a manner dictated by the means we have at our disposal. For altern ative, more
thorough discussions, see [17] and the references therein.
Proposition 7.1. For anyqsatisfying (3.2), the functionals
q±(ψ) :=/integraldisplay
|ψ′∓qψ|2dx=/integraldisplay
|ψ′|2+[q2±q′]|ψ|2dx, (7.3)
with domains D±:={ψ∈L2(R) :ψ∈H1

forms of positive semideﬁnite selfadjoint operators H±. Moreover,

R11(κ)+R22(κ)±R12(κ)±R21(κ)/bracketrightbig
, (7.5)
whereRjkare the component operators of R(κ) = (L+κ)−1.
Proof.Proposition 3.1 shows that the domain of the self-adjoint operator iOLOis
precisely D+⊕D−. It is then an elementary matter to deﬁne selfadjoint operators
H±through (7.4) and verify that (7.3) are the associated quadratic f orms; see [37]
for further background.
From the functional calculus of the selfadjoint operator iOLO, we have

The claim (7.5) follows from this and the symmetries (3.13). /square
In Proposition 3.1, we also described the Green’s functions associat ed to the Lax
operator L. Recall that those Green’s functions were not continuous; they c ontain
jumps at the diagonal of the same magnitude as the free Green’s fu nction (3.5).
These jumps cancel out in the combinations (7.5):52 J. FORLANO, R. KILLIP, AND M. VIS ¸AN

obtain (7.8), we simply combine (7.5) with (3.19) and (3.21). Lastly, (7 .7) follows
from (7.8), (3.23), and (3.24). /square
The Miura transformations w±(x;q) :=q(x)2±q′(x) were introduced in [31]
and marked the beginning of the discovery of the intimate connectio n between
(KdV) andSturm–Liouvilleproblems. Miura’sobservationwasthat if qis asmooth
solution to (mKdV), then both w±are smooth solutions of (KdV).
As the transformation q/ma√sto→ −qpreserves the Gibbs law, there is no advantage to
considering both Miura maps. We will conﬁne our attention to just
w(x;q) :=q′(x)+q(x)2. (7.9)
Forverygeneralfunctions q, wemayinterpretthederivativein(7.9)distribution-
ally. Insubsection7.1, wewillexaminethe resultingfamilyofrandomdis tributions.
In particular, we will give meaning to our claim that samples ‘have the re gularity
of white noise’, while also aﬃrming that the image measures are mutually singular
to white noise and to each other (as µvaries).
In order to view was a solution to (KdV), even distributionally, we must un-
derstand the squareofw. As observed in subsection 2.4, samples qfrom the Gibbs
state are not absolutely continuous on ﬁnite intervals or indeed, ev en of bounded
variation. In this way, q′may not be interpreted as a function and so cannot be
squared. (The otherterms in w2domakesense asdistributions.) It waspreciselyto
give an intrinsic notion of what it means for such irregular objects to be a solution
of (KdV) that the notion of green solutions was ﬁrst introduced in [2 2] building on
the use of diagonal Green’s functions in [23]. In subsection 7.2, we will demonstrate
that the solutions of (mKdV) described in Theorem 6.1 are indeed tra nsformed by
(7.9) into green solutions of (KdV); see (7.20). In choosing (7.20) a s the deﬁning
notion of green solution for (KdV), we have deviated slightly from [22 ]. In that
paper, the authors selected (3.6) from [23] as the basis for deﬁnin g green solutions.
Here we have adopted (3.10) from [23] instead.
In order to interpret these solutions to (KdV) as a measure-pres ervingsystem, it
is crucial that each initial data leads to a single solution. We will achieve this goal
by showing that the Miura map is almost surely injective, building on the analysis
of [17].INVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 53
7.1.The Miura mapping of Gibbs states. First we wish to understand the
smoothness properties of the distributions w=q′+q2by connecting them to the
regularityofBrownianmotion. Forourpurposes,themostconven ientdescriptionof

which, by the Minlos Theorem, may also serve as a deﬁnition of white no ise.
Proposition 7.3. Fixµ∈Rand suppose that the process q, deﬁned on some
probability space, follows the inﬁnite-volume Gibbs law wi th chemical potential µ.
The random distribution w=q′+q2has the same regularity as white noise in
the following sense: One may deﬁne a realization ˚wof white noise over the same
probability space so that the random distribution

may be represented, almost surely, by a continuous function . Nevertheless, the law

ability space via (2.52). We then use this to construct our realization ˚wof white
noise via (7.10). By construction,

Thus we see that this distribution may be represented, almost sure ly, by a contin-

(7.14) are mutually exclusive conditions on a distribution. It follows th at the laws

Next we prove that the Miura map is almost surely injective by combinin g the
deterministic analysis of [17] with probabilistic tools.54 J. FORLANO, R. KILLIP, AND M. VIS ¸AN
Proposition 7.4. The Miura map is almost surely injective: The set
/braceleftbig
q∈C(R) :∃˜q∈C(R)withq/ne}ationslash= ˜qbutq′+q2= ˜q′+q2as distributions/bracerightbig
(7.15)
is a null set for the inﬁnite-volume Gibbs law, irrespective ofµ∈R.
Proof.Supposeqbelongs to the set (7.15), as witnessed by ˜ q∈C(R). Then both
y(x) = exp/bracketleftbig/integraltextx
0q(s)ds/bracketrightbig
and ˜y(x) = exp/bracketleftbig/integraltextx
0˜q(s)ds/bracketrightbig
(7.16)
are positive distributional solutions to y′′= [q′+q2]y. Moreover, y(0) = ˜y(0) = 1.
Our goal is to show that y= ˜y, almost surely, and consequently, q= ˜q.
The classical reduction of order method of d’Alembert–Lagrange p rovides the
generalsolutionofaSturm–Liouvilleproblemonceoneparticularsolu tionisknown.
The paper [17] realized this idea for potentials that are merely H−1
loc(R) and from
their analysis, we conclude that
˜y(x) =y(x)/bracketleftbigg
1+c/integraldisplayx
0ds
y(s)2/bracketrightbigg
for somec∈R. (7.17)
In what follows, we will show that
limsup
x→∞/integraldisplayx
0ds
y(s)2=∞and limsup
x→−∞/integraldisplay0
xds
y(s)2=∞ (7.18)
almost surely. Recalling that y(x) and ˜y(x) are both positive, the former shows
thatc≥0 and the latter that c≤0. Thus, together they show that c= 0 and so
the injectivity claim will be veriﬁed.
By virtue of its continuity, q(x) is integrable on every ﬁnite interval. Combining
this with the deﬁnition (7.16) of y(x), we see that the two events described in (7.18)
are invariant under translations q(x)/ma√sto→q(x+h). As our process is ergodic under
such translations (see §2.3), it follows that the probability of each of these events
is either zero or one.
As the transformation q(x)/ma√sto→q(−x) preserves Gibbs measure, the two events
in (7.18) have the same probability. We will now use a similar symmetry to show
that the probability of the former is at least1
2and so must be one.
By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality,
x2≤/integraldisplayx
0e−2/integraltexts
0q(s′)ds′ds/integraldisplayx
0e2/integraltexts
0q(s′)ds′ds.
It follows that if one of these integrals does not diverge as x→ ∞, then the other
must diverge. The ﬁrst of these integrals is an exact recapitulation of the ﬁrst
integral in (7.18); the second corresponds to case where the Gibb s sampleq(x) is
replaced by −q(x). However, the mapping q/ma√sto→ −qpreserves the Gibbs measure
and so the ﬁrst event in (7.18) must have a probability of1
2or greater. /square
Corollary 7.5. Distinct values of the chemical potential lead to mutually s ingular
laws forw=q′+q2.
Proof.Given distinct chemical potentials, µ1<µ2, Corollary 2.12 shows that there
are disjoint measurable subsets A1andA2ofC(R) that have full Gibbs measure.
Proposition 7.4 shows that although the images of these sets under the Miura map
mightintersect, anysuch intersectionis anull set forthe pushfor wardofboth Gibbs
measures. /squareINVARIANT MEASURES FOR MKDV AND KDV IN INFINITE VOLUME 55

group of transformations on the space of tempered distributions . Our ﬁnal theorem
encapsulates the strong senses in which these orbits solve (KdV):
Theorem 7.6. Letq(t)denote the statistical ensemble of solutions to (mKdV)
constructed in Theorem 6.1 and consider the process w(t) :=q′(t)+q(t)2.

associated to the potential w(t)by Corollary 7.2.
Proof.It suﬃces to consider1
2< s≤1. Choosing b= 1 in (6.1), we see that
/an}b∇acketle{tx/an}b∇acket∇i}ht−1q(t,x) is H¨ older continuous as an H1−s(R)-valued function with all moments
ﬁnite. The claim (7.19) then follows easily. To treat q2, for example, one may just
use the embedding L1(R)֒→H−s(R), which is dual to Hs(R)֒→L∞(R).
By Theorem 6.1, the process q(t,x) follows the same Gibbs distribution for all
t∈R. It follows that the law of w(t) is likewise independent of t∈R.
Recall Theorem 6.1 also showed that q(t) is almost surely a green solution to
(mKdV), which is to say, we showed that the identities (3.75) and (3.7 6) both hold.
Taking a spatial derivative of the former and applying (3.26), (3.27) , and (3.28),
we deduce that

(7.8), we deduce (7.20). /square
