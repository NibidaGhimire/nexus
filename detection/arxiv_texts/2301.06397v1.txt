Abstract  
We perform a series  of repeated CO 2 injection s in a room -scale physical model of a faulted geological 
cross -section . Relevant parameters for subsurface carbon sequestration , including multiphase flows, 
capillary  CO 2 trapping , dissolution, and convectiv e mixing , are studied  and quantified . As part of a 
forecasting benchmark study , we address and quantify  six predefi ned metrics for storage capacity and 
security  in typical CO 2 storage operations . Using the same geometry , we investigate the degree  of 
reproducibility  of five repeated  experimental runs . Our analysis  focus es on physical variations of the 
spatial distribution of mobile and dissolved CO 2, multi phase  flow patterns , development  in mass of  the 
aqueous and gaseous phases , gravitational  fingers , and leakage dynamics . We observe  very good 
reproducibility  in homogenous regions with up to 97  % overlap between repeated runs , and that fault -
related heterogeneity  tends to decreas e reproducibility . Notably , we observe an oscillating  anticli ne 
CO 2 leakage  behavior  from an open anticline  with  a spill point in the immediate footwall of a normal 
fault, and discuss the u nderly ing causes f or the observed phen ome non within the constraints  of the 
studied system.   
1. Introduction  
In its simplest form, carbon sequestration involves the injection of ca ptured carbon dioxide (CO 2) into 
deep subsurface porous and permeable sedimentary rocks, overlain by an impermeable sealing layer. 
The migration of t he buoyancy -driven CO 2 is determined by: i. the intrinsic rock and fluid properties 
(e.g. porosity, permeab ility, fluid density, and viscosity); and ii. the distribution and properties of 
geological structures such as faults and fracture networks, that are  inherent to both reservoir and seal 
rocks. Faults are discontinuities that form at a range of scales; they  can act as conduits or barriers for 
flow, and they generally have directionally -dependent flow properties  [Bastesen and Rotevatn, 2012 ]. 
Large s ealing faults control storage site geometries and compartmentalization, whereas networks of 
small faults an d fractures may affect reservoir flow and seal integrity  [Ogata et al, 2014 ].  
Faults, fractures and flow  
The properties of the fracture networks (i.e. topology, connectivity, permeability) that form damage 
zones around faults as they evolve  [Nixon et al,  2020 ] are p articularly important to CO 2 flow . 
Subsurface faults are discerned from reflection seismic data, but descriptions suffer from limitations 
in seismic resolution and coverage. Geologically analogous outcrops and dedicated laboratory 
experiments provide a means to investigate smaller structure s around faults  and shed light on flow 
and sealing properties . Being able to identify and foreca st the behavior of potential subsurface bypass 
structures during CO 2 injection is essential; u nderstanding the int erplay between multiphase flow and 
fault evolut ion is critically needed for carbon sequestration projects. Despite this, the flow properties 
of faults and their damage zones remain insufficiently understood, and little is known about how their 
flow behavior evolves in the different stages of a carbon sequestration  project . Our current 
understanding of large -scale CO 2 plume migration is mainly from time -lapse seismic surveys with 
limited a priori knowledge  [Furre et al, 201 7]. With increases in reservoir pressures during CO 2 
injection, there is a greater risk of reactivati on and potential generation of new fracture networks that 
can enhance seal permeability, capillary flow and provide pathways for fluid escape  to shallower 
reservoirs or the surface (e.g. Ogata et al., 2014; Karstens and Berndt, 2015; Karstens et al., 2017 ).  2 
 Forecasting skills  
Accurate modeling and simulation of multiphase flow in porous media with faults is central to carbon 
sequestration foreca sting, risk assessment and mitigation strategies. Geologically accurate models are 
needed for simulating flow responses of faults, wher e analogous outcrops and laboratory experiments 
may be used to discern spatial variations within faults  [Rotevatn et al, 2009 ] to determine percolation 
potential. Susceptibility for reactivation upon pressurization can then be evaluated with 
geomechanical modelling. Forecasting  of field -scale CO 2 migration and reservoir pressure response is 
commonly achieved with history -matching and extrapolation exercises, routinely applied in 
hydrocarbon production. This approach can be effective with a limited number  of parameters  [Sharma 
et al, 2019 ], but flow simulations that include geologically realistic descriptions of faults and fracture 
networks are computationally expensive in universally applied industrial simulators. Current field -scale 
simulation approaches  requires  significa nt approximations, with respect either to spatial and temporal 
resolution, or to coupled processes, or both. Therefore, insights into scale -dependent flow behavior 
are needed to better couple flow dynamics in the presence of fault -related heterogeneity.   
The laboratory FluidFlower rig  and its relevance to subsurface storage   
The FluidFlower  concept  links research and dissemination through a new experimental rig  constructed 
at University of Bergen (UiB) that enables meter -scale , multiphase , quasi two -dimensional flow on 
model geological geometries with unprecedented data acquisition  and repeatability. The geological 
geometry of the physical room -scale model ( cf. Figure 1 ) is motivated by typical North Sea reservoirs . 
Structurally, the benchmark geometry is characterized by broad open folds and normal faults : a major 
normal fault breaches the lower reservo ir-seal system  and terminates upward at the base of the uppe r 
reservoir. A broad open anticline, in the footwall of the fault, forms the main trap to the lower 
reservoir -seal system  and has a spill point in the immediate footwall of the fault. The broad op en 
anticline is also the main trap geometry for the upper re servoir -seal system , but this is affected by a 
graben bounded by two oppositely dipping normal faults . Hence, the designed geometry focuses on 
the need to couple fault and flow  behavior  during CO 2 injectio n, and was designed to achieve realistic 
CO 2 flow and trapping mechanisms to benchmark the numerical modelling capability of the porous 
media community  with new physical measurement of key processes .  
 
While the present  study is at the laboratory scale, the fundamental physical processes of multi phase , 
multi -component flows in heterogeneous porous media are the s ame as at reservoir conditions. The 
most important subsurface CO 2 trapping mechanisms are present in the FluidFlower rig : structural  
trapping  occurs under the sealing sand layers and within different reservoir zones ; dissolution  trapping  
occurs almost instantaneously when the injected CO 2 dissolves into the water phase initially saturating 
the porous media ; residual trapping  is observed in re gions with intermediate water saturation , but is 
temporary because of rapid dissolution ; convective mi xing occurs when the CO 2-saturated water 
migr ates downwards and generat e gravitational fingers . Mineral trapping  is by design  not part of the 
bench mark study for incr eased con trol of active chemistry (very pure silica sand is used , and the 
pressure and temperature conditions are set outside mineralization thresholds within the 
experimental time series) . Hence, the observed flow and trapping behavior in the FluidFlower rig to a 
large degree represents the physical in a subsurface system, even if the petrophysical properties like 
porosity and permeability, as well as the pressure  and temperature condi tions are not directly 
comparable to subsurface conditions.  Furthermore , we remar k that the structural  trapping in the 
FluidF lower relies more on capillary entry pressure, a nd less on permeability contrast, than expected 
at the fi eld scale . Overall , we argue that the findings and  observations in this study are indicative of 
field -scale simulation , although several observed phenomena scale differently  in the FluidFlower 
compared  with subsurface sy stems  (for a detailed  scaling analysis, see Kovscek e t al 2023 , this issue ).  
 
Despite  the physical simi larities , actual field scale  simulation will deviate from this study in se veral 
important aspects, of which  we highlight  (see Flemish  et al 2023 , this issue , for a comprehensive 
discussion ): 
- Heterogeneity.  The facies in the benchmark geometry  were built with a single sand type aiming 
for homogenous  petrophysical properties , and, hence,  emphasizing larger scale structural  3 
 heterogeneities . On the field scale, it is expected that  there  will be significant  subscale 
heterogeneity also within each geological st ructure.  
- Quality of g eological characterization.  A high -resolution image  of the geological geometry , 
with accompanying  thickness es befo re CO 2 injections , was issued to the benchmark  
participants  (cf. Nordbotten et al 2022). At the field scale, the initial  geological characterization 
will associated with higher uncertainty and lower spatial res olution data from  seismic surveys .  
- Pressure and temperature conditions.  The laboratory conditions in the reported study yield  a 
gaseous CO 2 phase  when injected , compared  with liquid or supercritical phase at field 
conditions  in typically reservoirs . The difference  in phase condition  has a minor  impact on 
viscosity, but leads to a denser and less compressible CO 2 phase  at the field scale . 
 
The importance of forecasting, risk assessment and mitigation strategies for carbon sequestration, 
with many of the critical coupled subsu rface processes remaining poorly understood, merits a 
continued broad interdisciplinary engagement. The utility of numerical modeling and simulation as a 
key decision -making tool for industri al application of CO 2 storage is scrutinized  in the FluidFlower 
international benchmark initiative . 
 
2. Materials and Methods  
This section  briefly describes the key operational  considerations and methodology developed to 
perform the experimental part of the Benchmark study. It provides an overview o f all procedural steps , 
a description of the geological geom etry and parameters . The description is not exhaustive, and the 
reader is referred supplementary materials (S M) and cited work for more detailed description s.

Throughout the article we refer to the gaseous form of CO 2 as ‘gas’ – the dry gas injected will partially 
partition into the aqueous phase saturating the porous media, and will have a positive, non-zero water 
content due to  solubility of water in CO 2. The water  content  in CO 2 was not explicitly quantified  in this  
work . We refer to the aqueous phase partially saturated with dissolved CO 2 as the ‘CO 2-saturated 
water’, and the aqueous phase without CO 2 as ‘formation water’. The aqueous , pH-sensitive solution 
(‘formation water ’) was in equilibrium with the atmosphere when injected  and contained dissolved 
atmospheric gases  (predominantly nitrogen and o xygen ). The presence of other gases influence s the 
CO 2-to-water mass t ransfer due to differences in gas-to-water Henry’s constant  [Van De Ven and 
Mumford, 2020 ]: the CO 2 mass transfer to the formation water release s nitrogen and oxygen into the 
gaseous phase . Hence,  over time the gaseous phase  in the system becomes deprived of  CO 2, with 
reduced  solubility in water. This effect was predominately observed towards the later -life of the gas 
accumulation under the anticlines, and is discussed more below.   4 
 2.2 Sand handling and porous media flow properties  
Danish quartz san d was purchased ( in total  3.5 tons ) and systematically treated to achieve the required 
properties. Six different s and types were used in the benchmark study (see Table 2). Before use, each 
sand was manually sieved from the supplied sand stock  and treated with a strong acid (HCL) to remove 
impurities  (predominately calcite) . The acid was neutralized with sodium hydroxide , rinsed with tap 
water while manual ly agitating to remove precipitates and dust until no visible particles, then rinsed 
in tap water multip le times until clear solution  without particles.  The sand wa s then dried at 60  °C until 
dry and stored in cleaned plastic containers with lid until use . The absolute permeability was measured 
for each sand, all with nominal porosity 0.44. Detailed sand description, properties and procedural 
steps are outlined in [Haugen et al.  2023 , this is sue].

2.3 The FluidFlower rig and building the geometry  
The FluidFlower  enables meter -scale multiphase quasi two -dimensional flow experiments on model 
geological geometries with unprecedented data acquisition  and r epeatability. Time -lapsed images are 
acquired to monitor dynamic, multiphase flow patterns with high spatial resolution where single sand 
grains may be identified. The CO 2-saturated water is distinguished from formation water by a color 
shift of aqueous pH  sensitive solution, whereas the gas phase is observed by reduction in colored 
aqueous phase (formation or CO 2-saturated water). The design allows for repeated injections tests 
with near identical initial conditions , allowing physical uncertainty  and varia bility  to be addressed  using 
the same geological geometry. The model geological geometr y is constructed using unconsolidated 
sands (cf. Table 2) and held in place between an optically transparent front panel and a n opaqu e back 
panel . The rig has 56 perfora tions that enable a range of well configurations  (injector, producer, 
monitoring, or plugged)  for porous media flow studies.   
 
The FluidFlower rig is curved to sustain  internal forces and capable of  porous media up to 
approximately 6 m2 (3 m length x 2 m h eight) . The benchmark study monitored four wells  (two for CO 2 
injection  and two for pressure  measurements) , but several other wells  were active during the 
experiments . Technical wells/ ports  at the b ottom and top enable d re-setting fluids between CO 2 
inject ions and to maintain a fixed water column experiments.  Technical considerations and mechanical 
properties of the FluidFlower rig are detailed elsewhere [ Eikehaug et al  2023 a, this issue ]. The 
FluidFlower has no -flow boundaries at the bottom and both sides , whereas the top is open with a fixed 
free water column  (constant hydr ostatic head) . Relevance for subsurface carbon sequestration 
processes is maintained as domi nant multiphase flow  parameters and trapping mechanisms are 
present in the roo m-scale laboratory flow rig, including capillarity, dissolution, and convective mixing.  
 
The dry, unconsolidated sand s were meticulously poured from the top into the water -filled void 
between the front and back panels. Each  layer  (consist ing of one sand type , except  the heterogeneous  
fault ) was constructed from the bott om and upw ards , and faults and large dipping angle  were created 
by manipulating the layer during pouring using guiding polycarbonate rectangles, funnels a nd plastic 
hoses. Mechanical manipulation (raking/scratching) was kep t to a minimum and only in some areas  in 5 
 the vi cinity of the faults. Faults were constructed though an iterative process , detailed in [Haugen et al  
2023 , this issue ], and the seal ed fault was  created usin g a silicone rubber rectangle.  The hydrostatic 
pressure during geomet ry assembly was 10 0 mm above  operating conditio ns. When the geometry was 
complete , the water -level was lowered to operating water -level (kept constant during all injections). 
Multiple flu shing sequences  using injection rates 10% higher than the injection p rotocols (cf. SM 4) 
were pe rformed to achieve an initial, pre -injection sand settling to improve conditions for 
reproducibility during CO 2 injections . The nominal poro us media depth  was 19 mm, but depth 
variations were observed and acco unted for with a spatially r esolved depth map (cf.  SM 2). 
2.4 The rationale behind the B enchmark geometry  
The geological geometry of the physical room -scale model (cf. Figure 1 ) was motivated by typical North 
Sea reservoirs . It was developed in close interdisciplinary collaboration between UiB researchers from 
reservoir physics, earth science and applied mathemat ics based on the following four  principles : 
1. Incorporate relevant features frequently encountered in subsurface geo logical carbon 
sequestration  
2. Enable realistic CO 2 flow patterns and trapping scenarios with increasing modeling 
complexity  
3. Sufficiently idealized for the sand facies  to be reproduced numerically with high accuracy     
4. Be able to operate , monitor  and reset the fluids  within a reasonable time frame  
The geometry was designed to achieve realistic CO 2 flow and trapping m echanisms  to evaluate the 
modelling capability of the porous media community. The anticipated  CO 2 flow , migration  and phase 
behavior  from each of the two CO 2 injection wells are described below , along with a geological 
interpretation of the benchmark geometry  where geological  features described are found in Figure 1  
and highlighted in italic  below.  
 
Geological interpretation of benchma rk geometry  
The benchmark geometry is a compromise between geological realism , building  a physical model from 
unconsolidated sand , and accurate gridding for numerical simulations of the geometry . The benchmark 
geometry comprises tw o stacked res ervoir -seal systems , each capped by regional seals (represented 
by sand ESF ). The lower reservoir is a homogeneous, high permeability  reservoir ( sand F) overlain by a 
laterally continuous seal. In contrast, the upper reservoir is strat igraphic ally more het erogeneous, 
forming an overall upward fining succession, but with permeability variations within the coarse sand 
layers (alternation of sands E , F, D and C) , and additional stratigraphic complexity around a sealed fault  
associated with the loc al development of sands C and  D. 
  
Structurally, the benchmark geometry is relatively simple, characterized by broad open folds and 
normal faults. The major left -dipping normal fault (heterogeneous fault ) breaches the lower reserv oir-
seal system  and term inates upward at the base of the upper reservoir  (within sand F) . A broad open 
anticline, in the footwall of the fault, forms the main trap to the lower reservoir -seal system  and has a 
spill point in the immediate footwall of the fa ult. The broad open anti cline is also the main trap 
geometry for the upper reservoir -seal system , but this is affected by a graben bounded by two 
oppositely dipping normal faults ; one sealed fault and one open fault . An additional, subtle, low relief 
anticline forms  an additional  trap in the footwall of the graben -bounding sealed fault. The graben -
bounding faults tips -out down dip into the basal layer of the upper reservoir ( sand E) and updip into 
the base of the top regional seal (the uppermost sand layer in the model), as such t hey only affect the 
stratigraphy in the uppermost reservoir. The sealed and open faults  have different properties and 
sealing potential : the sealed fault  is designed as a sealing fault  with a low permeability fault core, 
whereas the open fault  has a high p ermeability fault core and would potentially act as a conduit for 
cross -formational fluid flow.  
 
Anticipated flow from well [9,3] . The buoyant  gas phase flow s upwards and reach the anticline sealing 
layer (sand ESF) above the injection point  [9,3] . CO 2-saturated water is observed  in the near -well region 
directly after onset of CO 2 injection. The  anticline dipping angle  facilitates gas migration into Box A  and 6 
 accumulat ion at the highest point of the CO 2 trap. The trap fill s with gas and a layer with  CO 2- saturated 
water  forms  underneath the downwards expanding  gas accumu lation . The CO 2-saturated water  flows 
downwards  into Box C  over time due to i) the positive pressure gradient  from the expanding gas and 
ii) convection because of the increased density relative to formation water. The gas accumulation  
increase s upon continued injection  until the gas -water interface  aligns with the spill point ; the excess 
gas flows through  the heterogeneous fault  and into Box B  containing  the fining upwards sequence and 
upper fault  zone.  The layered sequence ( sand s F, E, D and C, bottom to top) temporarily traps  buoyant  
gas and laterally spread s the gas phase at the capillary barriers  between layers . The increased density 
of CO 2-saturated water relative to the formation water leads to gravit ational fingers.  The CO 2 injecti on 
ends (after 305 min) when the gas reach es the upper sand layer  (sand C) under the seal , and CO 2 in all 
forms is contained between the left no -flow boundary and the sealed fault .  
 
Anticipated flow from well [17,7]. The gas phase (injected in sand F ) flow s upwards  and spread s 
laterally at layer boundaries in the fining upwards sequence (except  between sand F and E,  cf. Table 
2). The gas phase advance s upwards sequentially when it exceeds the capillary entry pressure in each 
layer . The CO 2-saturated water  flows  downwards due increased de nsity  and the pressure gradient  of 
the gas accumulation  – its flow pattern is influenced by the permeability variations  in the layered 
sequence.  The gas phase accumulate s under the top seal a bove the injection well and migrate s laterally  
until CO 2 injection is terminated (after 165 min) . Depending on the amount of CO 2 injected, the gas 
phase will reach the  open fault , and  CO 2 in all forms will be contained between the open fault  and the 
right no-flow boundary .

towards the top  aids the following coordinat ion. Four monitored ports: t wo CO 2 injection well (red circles , 
coordinates [9,3] and [17,7] ) and pressure ports (purple circles, coordinates [15,5] and [17,11] ). Areas for

= BR; bottom left = BL): Box A:  TL [11,6 ] -> TR [28,6 ], BL [11,0 ] -> BR [28,0 ]; Box B: TL [0,12 ] ->TR [11, 12 ], BL [0,6] 
-> BR [11,6]; Box C: TL [11, 4 ] ->TR [26,4 ], BL [11,1 ] ->BR [26,1 ].

 2.5 Image acquisition and analysis  
The camera (Sony A 7III, len s SAM YANG AF 45 mm F1.8) used the following settings  (kept constant 
through all injections) : shutter speed  1/30 sec ; F number  F2.8; ISO 100 ; color temperature 4100 K ; and, 
manual focus ). The camera was positioned  in the curve focal point with a 3.6 m distance from the 
center point in the rig , hal fway up the window height. Images were captured at high spatial ( 7952  x 
4472  pixel s, for a total of 35.5 megapixe ls) and temporal (between 10 sec to 5 min  intervals, depending 
on active experimental phase) resolution to capture displacement and mass -transfer dynamics . Each 
run consists of more than 1000 images ; a subset that captures key events , displacement processes  and 
mass -transfer dynamics is available for open -access download  (Eikehaug et al 202 3b). The subset 
contains 137 high -resolution i mages  with the following intervals: 10 images before CO 2 injection at 20 
second intervals; images every 5 min during the first 360 min (6 hours) of the experiment ( 73 images ); 
images every hour until 48 hours (42 images) ; images every 6 hours until end of experiment ( 12 
images).  
 
Image analysis  toolbox  
To use the high -resolution images as measurement  data, image analysis is requ ired. As part of the 
benchmark study, t he open -source image analysis software DarSIA (short for Darcy Scale Image 
Analysis, Both et al , 2023a) has been developed , detailed in [Nordbotten  et al 2023 , this issue ]. DarSIA 
provides  the capability to extract physically interpretable data from images for quantitative analysis of 
the image sequences of the time -lapsed CO 2 injection and storage experiments. In particular, DarSIA  
includes preprocessi ng tools to align  images ; project suitable regions of interest  of images onto two -
dimensional  Cartesian coordinate systems ; correcting for geometrical discrepancies due to e.g.  the 
curved nature of the physical asset ; as well as correct ing white balance fluctuations and perform color 
correction  utilizing the color checker attached to the physical asset , overall , resulting  in unified image 
sequences . Further more, additional  analysis tools are available to e.g. determine spatial deformation 
map s comparing  different configurations  and extract concentration profile s or identify phases , to 
men tion a few . The latter aims at a Darcy scale interpretation of the high -resolution images taken of 
the physical asset , effectively, removing sand grains and upscaling fluid  quantities .  
 
Phase identification  
The image analysis toolbox was used to separate between the different CO 2 phases ( gaseous and 
aqueous)  present  in the experiments, and  a set of assumptions enabled the quantification of each 
phase  to be calculated  during the CO 2 injection and associated mixing . Four main phases are 
anticipated:  
  
1. Free gas ( pote ntially flowing gas phase with non -zero gas permeability, referred to as mobile 
gas) 
2. Trapp ed gas (residually trapped CO 2 with zero gas permeability, referred to as immobile gas)  
3. CO 2-saturated water (aqueous phase with a non -zero C O2 content)  
4. Formation water (aqueous solution with zero CO 2 content)  
 
A range of assumptions (cf. SM 3) was needed to quanti tatively describe the observed multiphase flow 
phenomena during repeated CO 2 injections in the physical flow rig . Based  on these assumptions, a 
geometric separation of the formation water  from  any CO 2 in the system  and of the gaseous CO 2 from  
the CO 2-saturated water is sufficient. This separation was possible due to the use of the pH -indicator 
mix (cf. Table 1 and Figure 2). Through pixel -wise  image comparison to the  image correspond ing to the 
injection start, a thresholding approach both in terms of monochromatic color space and signal  
intensity accomplishes the separation  (in addition further techniques are used to convert the signal to 
Darcy -scale quantities , cf. Nordbotten  et al 2023 , this issue ). The heterogeneous nature of the 
geometry is considered  in the analysis by choosing facies -based threshold parameters , and thereby 
allows for tailored  and relatively accurate phase  segmentation , cf. Figure 2. The parameters are chosen 
such that transition zones are included as demonstrated . The same unified setup has been used for 
analyzing all experimental runs.

Figure 2.  Resulting phase identification of formation water, CO 2-saturated water and free gas using DarSIA, at 
injection stop; two plumes are identified, containing free gas regions (yellow contour) and CO 2-saturated water 
(green contour). Subfigure B: The pH -indica tor mix (left and right, with and without contours, resp.) allows for 
visual separation of the different phases based on color spectra. Subfigure C: Detection of free gas in the open  
fault. Subfigure D: Due to the use of regularization in the upsc aling, DarSIA smears out fingers and thus merely 
detects fingertips  for fingers  that are closer than a few grai n diameters . 
 
It must  be noted, that based on the choice of the assumptions and the resulting image analysis , the 
identification of gaseous phases for which assumption SM 3.I is not satisfied, may be erroneous; 
transition zo nes smear out and the saturati on decays which leads to a sudden disappearance of the 
post -processed gaseous phase  due to the use of fixed threshold parameters . In all experimental runs, 
two gaseous regions are detected, cf. Figure 2, and the described effect takes place for the upper 
gaseous region, whereas the low er region is detected stably. While the upper region fully dissolves, 
the lower region results in remaining gas, cf. SM 3.III, which is detected as gaseous CO 2. Consequently , 
the subsequent quantita tive analysis reports on a small amount of non -vanishing gas accumulation 
towards the end of the expe rimental runs.  
 
Procedure in the quantitative  analysis  
The subsequent  quantitative analysis results from  post -processing the phase identification. We briefly 
elaborate on the procedure of key computations.

CO 2,𝑚𝐶𝑂2𝑔=𝜙⋅𝑑 ⋅𝑠𝑔 ⋅𝜒𝑐𝑔, and dissolved CO 2, 𝑚𝐶𝑂2𝑤=𝜙⋅𝑑 ⋅𝑠𝑤 ⋅𝜒𝑐𝑤, with the single 
components determined as follows . Based on assumption SM 3.V, the poros ity 𝜙 and the 
depth 𝑑  can be accurately  determined . Resulting from assumption SM 3.I, the phase 
identification provides saturation maps  𝑠𝑔 for the gaseous  phas e and 𝑠𝑤 for the aqueous 
phase , taking values either 0 or 1 . It remains to quantify the mass concentrations of CO 2, 𝜒𝑐𝑔 
and 𝜒𝑐𝑤 in gaseous and aqueous phases , respectively.  Based on assumption  SM 3.I, 𝜒𝑐𝑔 is 
prov ided as the densit y of gaseous CO 2 under  operational conditions, cf. SM 1 , obtained from  
the NIST databas e (Lemmon et al. 2022 ). With  that, the pixel -wise areal density  𝑚𝐶𝑂2𝑔 is known . 
Assum ption SM 3.II allows  now  for obtaining the remaining mass concentration  𝜒𝑐𝑤 through 
sparsification , as follows . As illust rated in Figure 2, two CO 2 plumes originating from the two 
injection p orts remain unconnected throughout almost  the entire run time  (until 84 hours ). 
The total CO 2 mass in each plume is known at any point in time  based on the i njection protocol , 
cf. SM 4 , while the  respective  total mass of mobile CO 2 is determined through integration of 
𝑚𝐶𝑂2𝑔 over the area of the plumes.  Subtraction  of both  provides the total mass of dissolved CO 2 
for each plume. Finally, b y assum ption SM 3.II, 𝜒𝑐𝑤set t o be 0 in the formation water ; constan t 
and equal to the prop ortionality  constant between the total volume  and the to tal mass of 
9 
 dissolved CO 2 in each connected region of CO 2-saturated water 𝜒𝑐𝑤; and n ot relevant  for the 
mass calculations, yet for the discussio n of convective mixing, in  the remaining gaseous  
regions, 𝜒𝑐𝑤 is set to 𝜒𝑐,𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑤 =1.8 kg/m3.  
2. Physical variability.  Given a set of phase  segmentations, associated to different configurations, 
the intersections and complements of phase  segmentations can be directly determined. 
Furthermore, we introduce metrics  based on volume -weighted rati os of the se, to quantify 
corresponding overla p and unique  appearances of detected regions . 
3. Fronts and fingers.  When restricted to a reg ion of interest, the internal interface between the 
detected water formation and the CO 2-saturated water can be interpreted as propagating  
front.  Its length  can be determined by making use of the Cartesian coordinate system attached 
to the images. Extremal  points can be identified as fingertips , allowing to count them ove r 
time.  Due to the use of regularization in DarSIA, when converting grain -scale data to Darcy 
scale, fingers are slightly smeared out. This affects the detection of the free space in between 
fingers , cf. Figure 2. Thus, in these regions the resulting int erface  between the formation water 
and CO 2-saturated water can be understood as  approximating non -convex hull of the fingers 
with its length being a  lower estimate to the actual contour length of the fingers. The detection 
of single fingertips is however n ot aff ected resulting in lower uncertainty .

 3. Results and Discussion  
This section is divided into two parts : Part 1  relates to the spar se data set requested in the benchmark 
study  [Flemish et al  2023 , this issue ], and include s a discussion on temporal behavior for studied 
parameters  across repeated runs ; Part 2  expands our analysis and focuses on physical variability  
between repeated injections , drivers  for the observed variability . 
3.1 The benchmark spar se data set  
The s parse data set [Nordbotten et al.  2022 ] request ed six data point s to assess the  ability of the 
participati ng mod eling groups  to forecast  relevant properties of the physical system. The CO 2 phase 
was to be  reported in the following three categories: mobile free phase  (gas at saturations with a 
positive gas relative permeability), immobile free phase  (gas at saturations with zero gas relative 
permeability), dissolved  (mass of CO 2 in CO 2-saturated water ). The sum of the mobile , immobile  and 
dissolve d phases equals  the total mass of CO 2. The sparse data set is included for completeness here, 
but t he reader is referred to [Flemish et al  2023 , this issue ] for  comprehensive analysis and discussion .  
The f ollowing  sparse data were  requested  (cf. Figure 1  for described regio ns and pressure ports ):  
1. As a proxy for assessing risk of mechanical disturbance of the overburden : Maximum pressure 
[N/m2] at pressure port a) [15,5]  and b) [17,11] .  
2. As a proxy for when leakage risk starts declining : Time [s] of maximum mobile CO 2 [g] in Box A.  
3. As a proxy for our ability to accurately forecast  near -well phase partitioning : CO 2 mass  [g] of a) 
mobile ; b) immobile ; c) dissolved ; and d) total in seal in Box A at 72 hours after injection start .  
4. As a proxy for our ability to handle uncertain geological features : CO 2 mass  [g] of a) mobile ; b) 
immobile ; c) dissolved ; and d) total in seal in Box B at 72 hours after injection start .  
5. As a proxy for our ability to capture onset of convective mixing : Time [s] for which the quantity  
 
𝑀(𝑡)≡∫|∇(𝜒𝑐𝑤(𝑡)
𝜒𝑐,max𝑤 )| 𝑑𝑥
𝐶  
 
first exceeds 110% of the width of Box C, where  𝜒𝑐𝑤 is the mass fraction of CO 2 in CO 2-
saturation  water .  
6. As a proxy for our ability to capture migration into low -permeable seals : Total mass of CO 2 [g] 
in the top seal facies ( sand ESF ) at final time within Box A.  
 
Here we  report laboratory sparse dataset (cf. Table 3 ) using the dataset [Eikehaug  et al. 2023 b] and 
dedicated DarSIA scripts  (Both et al 2023b) with assumptions (cf. SM 3 ). The CO2 distribution after 72 
hours  with location s of Bo x A, B ox B and Bo x C is included to aid interpretation  (see Figure 3).

Figure 3. Distribution of CO 2 after 72 h ours  for run  C3. The position s of Box A (green , dashed line ), Box B (white , 
dashed line)  and Box C ( blue , dashed line)  are used to populate  the spar se benchmark data set. The shaded 
regions in the  benchmark  geometry  (top right and bottom left) are outside the def ined boxes. CO 2 (in any form) 
in the shaded regions was not included in the ana lysis for the sparse data set.   
 
Maximum pressure at ports [15,5] and [17,11 ] (parameters  1a and 1b). The maximum pressures at the 
pressure ports ([15,5] and [17,11 ]) located in the sealing structure s (sand ESF, cf. Figure 1 ) were initially  
recorded with five pressure transducers  (ESI, GSD 4200 -USB, -1 to 2 bara ) because single digits mi llibar 
pressure gauge s were not  available for the benchmark study . The results were , however, discarded  
because 75% of the transducers recorded pressure s less than the atmospheric  pressure in the room. 
Hence , we use historical atmospheric pressure d ata reported from a nearby meteorological  weather 
station ( cf. SM 1), and adjust for  differences  in height and hydrostatic pressur es (see Table 3 ).  We 
apply an  uncertainty of ± 1 mbar , five times stated instrument accuracy , to account for the po ssible 
over pressure during CO 2 injections.     
Time of maximum mobile CO 2 in Box A  (parameter 2) . The development in mobile  gas in Box A for all 
five runs (cf. Figure 4) increase d linearly wi th the injection rate until  the gas accumulation aligned with  
the spill point (defined  in Figure 1). On average , the  maximum mass of mobile gas was observed after  
4.11  ± 0.17 hours . While there  appears to be  is some noise in the identification of the mobile gas, the 
time of maximum value is a clearly defined peak  in the time series . Seen together with  temporal  
resol ution of the image series (20 seconds  per frame ), we expect  the uncertainty  of our identification 
of the  time  of maximum mobile CO 2 to have an uncertainty of no more than three frames, i.e.  ± 1 min . 
The nature behind the fluctuati ng mass after the initial  spill (cf. black rectangle , Figure 4) is discussed 
in more detail in chapter 3. 2. 
 
Mobile, immobile and dissolved CO 2 in Box A  and Box B  (parameters 3, 4 and 6 ). The mass of mobile 
gas in Box A (paramet er 3a in Table 3 ) was on average  0.232 ± 0.04 7 g, and is con sidered an upper 
bound for th is parameter. The lower bound was found indirectly from the observation of  non-zero 
mass of  mobile gas at the end o f the experiment s (cf. Figure 4), related to atmospheric gases in the 
formation water due to insufficient degassing (c f. chapter 2.1  and Haugen et al 2023 , this issue ). Based 
on our physical  understanding of the studied system , we anticipate that the mass of mobil e CO2 should 
be zero at the end of the exper iment. Hen ce, w e subtract the end point mass from the upper bound 
to find an estimate of the lower bound , cf. Table 3. An alternative , but also physical ly plausible , lower 
12 
 bound for parameter  3a is zero , where a ll the mobile gas (CO2) is dissol ved in the CO 2-satur ated water. 
The mass of mobile gas in Box B after 72 hours  (parameter 4a) is reported as zero  because mobile gas 
was not observed in the segmented images .  
 
The mass of i mmobile gas in Box A and Box B ( parameters 3b and 4b in Table 3 ) were reported as zero 
because  the formation water  did not generate a  unique and  characteristic color for immobile gas . 
Hence, DarSIA and its color/signal -based segmentation  (cf. chapter 2.5 ) is not able to dist inguish 
immobile gas from the other phases . Careful visual inspe ction identif ied small  amounts of immob ile 
gas at early times, but visual inspection  at 72 hours did not identi fy any immo bile gas . This is consiste nt 
with our physical  understanding of the system, where isolat ed gas bubbles are expected to dissolve 
quickly .  
 
The mass of dissolved gas in the CO 2-saturated water  in Bo x A and Box B after 72 hours (parameters 3c 
and 4c in Table 3 ) were 3.10 ± 0.07 g (Bo x A) and  0.77 8 ± 0.066  g (Box B ), see Figure 5. The mass 
calculations use the know n inject ed CO 2 mass i n well [9, 3] for Box A and well [17, 11] for Box B , and 
apply DarSIA to segment the separate  plumes  originating from each well  to calculate  the mass of 
mobile and dissolved g as (cf. chapter 2.5). The two plumes remain unconnected throughout almost  
the entire run time  (until 84 hours ), and the total CO 2 mass in each plume is known at any point in time  
based on the i njection protocol . After 84 hours the plumes m erge and the plots are extrapolated to 
120 hours (end of experiment) based on current trends. The mass  of CO 2 in the seal ing structures in 
Box A and Box B after  72 hours ( parameters 3d and 4d in Table 3)  were 0.382 ± 0.012 (Box A, cf. Figure 
5) and 0.0 0 (Box  B). Mobile  and dissolved gas did not enter the top regi onal seal confined wi thin Box 
B, but minute  amount s of dissolved gas (in the order of 10-3 g) entered the seal ing structure in the 
lower , right corner of Box B  after 72 hours . Hence,  the final  mass of C O2 in the seal ing structure 
confined within B ox A  (parameter 6, cf. Figure 6) was on average  0.567 ± 0.035. For the parameters  
discussed here ( 3c, 3d, 4c, 4d and  6) we attribute  a nominal measurement uncertainty  of ± 20 % based 
on the limit ations  and influence  of underlying assumptions (cf. SM 3), stated weakness in the analysis 
of the color scheme (cf. chapter 2. 5), extrapolating trends  and operational difficulties with 
mineralization of methylene red .  
 
 
 
Figure 4. Development in mass [g] of mobile gas in B ox A for the whole experimental time (120 hours) for all five 
runs (C1 – C5) and the average ( black , dashed line) . The mass increase d linearly with the injection rate until spill 
time (cf. Table 3), and the n decreased be cause the mobile gas dissolved into the fo rmation water . The 
developm ent in mobile mass  associated with  the spill point (black rectangula r) is discussed in detail below.

Figure 5. The developmen t in mass of dissolved CO 2 [g] in CO 2-saturated water  in Box A (open circl es) and Box B  
(crosses)  for runs C1 -C5 during the whole experimental time (120 hours) . All mass curves increase from the onset 
because mobile gas dissolved into the formation water  to form CO2-saturated water  and reach plateau  values 
when most of the gas within each box is dissolved.  The curves in Box B  remain zero until the gas  exceeds the spill 
point and flow into the fault ( after approximat ely 4 h ours). The somewhat different  development  for run C1 in 
Box A (blue circles)  and run C5 in Box B (purple cross es) relates to the inconsi stencies for these runs, discussed 
in chapter 3.2. Note  that the average curves (black, dashed lines) are calculated until 84 hours . 
 
 
Figure 6. Development of CO 2 (in any form ) in sealing layer (sand ESF) confined within Box A during the whole 
experimental time (120 hours ) for all five run s (C1 -C5). Only CO 2-satur ated water  (no gas) was observed in the 
sealing layer  in Bo x A, and advection  from the underlaying gas was the main driving forc e for increased mass 
initially . After gas injection stop ped ( after approximately 5 hours) , there was a slight decrease of CO2 mass in the 
sealing layers, e xplained by gravity of the denser CO 2-saturated water and diminishing advective forces due to  a 
reducing gas cap under the anticli ne. After a pproximately 20 hours, the mass  increase again because CO 2-
saturated water from injector [17, 7] flows downwards and enters the top boundary of Box A  (cf. Figure 4 after 
72 hours) .  
 
Development in M (t) relative to the width of Box C  (parameter 5) .  
The 𝑀(𝑡) (parameter 5 in Table 3) is a measure  of the total variation  of the concentration field . As 
such, it is related to the contour lengths of the  density driven fingers, and we normalize it relative to 
the length of Box C , so that a value of 𝑀𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 (𝑡)=1 corresponds to no fingers below a gas cap 
spanning the whole length of the top of Box C . As CO2-satur ated water migrated down wards due to 
gravity, the contour lines  and the 𝑀𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 (𝑡) increase  (see Figure 7). On average for the five runs  
𝑀𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 (𝑡) exceeds 110% of the wi dth of Box  C after 4.14 ± 0.4 hours , where the stated times for each 
run may be considered as an upper bound due to the assumption that the concentrations are constant, 
which decreases t he measure of the gradient in the integral . A lower bound  is the time when 
14 
 𝑀𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 (𝑡) reache d 100% of the length of Box C , which is closely correlate d to ga s filling the upper 
boundary of  Box C, a n ecessary prerequisi te for 𝑀𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 (𝑡) exce eding 1 10%.  
  
Figure 7. Development  in 𝑀𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 (𝑡) for all five run s from injection sta rt until end of experiment  (120 hour s). For 
the initial state of a  zero CO 2 concentr ation within Box C,  𝑀𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 (𝑡) takes the value 0.   Run C1 ( blue) is ahead  of 
the other  runs, both in the start and at the end ( fingers start to leave Box C). The rapid increase between 3 and 
4 hours arises because the mobile g as fills the top of  Box C . The reverse is true after approximately  10 hours ( 6 
hours for run  C1) when the gas accumulation  (due to sh rinking by dissolution) e xits the upper boundary of Box C 
and the parameter 𝑀𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 (𝑡) rapid ly decrease s. This is counterbalanced to some extent by the further 
development of the density -driven fingers, as see n around 20 hours, until dissolution and diffusion eventually 
leads to a more uniform distribution of dissolved CO 2, and 𝑀𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 (𝑡) approaches 0  again.  
 
3.2 Physical repeatability of m ultiphase flow during laboratory carbon sequestration  runs   
The benchmark study consisted  of five operational ly identical CO 2 injection experiments using the 
same geological geometry  and initial  conditio ns. The experiments were designed to generat e physical  
data for model comparison , with the motivation to achieve a physical ‘ground truth ’. Here we discuss 
physi cal repeatability between the five run s (C1-C5) by comparing the degree of areal sweep overlap 
incorporating all forms of CO 2 (mobile, immo bile, dissolved ) in three regions (Box A, Box B ’ and Box D , 
cf. Figure 8 ) with increasing geological complexity . We quantify the degree of overlap of runs C2, C3 
and C4, and discuss the unique ness of each run.  
 
Figure 8. Degree of physical overlap and description  of Box A, Box B’ and Box D with increasing geological 
complexity . Box A is identical to Figure 1; Box B ’ is an extension of Box B (cf. Figure 1 ) and includes  the lower part 
of the geometry left to the heterogenous faul t; Box D includes the fini ng upwards sequence associated with 
injector [17,7] and the open fault  (cf. Figure 1 ). The CO 2 distribution (all forms ) for all fiv e run s (C1 -C5) in three 
15 
 boxes (Box A, Box B ’ and Box D ) after 155 min of CO 2 injection . Spatial ly distributed  overl ap for all runs, with the 
following color scheme : gray  (overlap C2+C3+C4 ); blue ( unique C1); orange ( unique  C2); green  (unique  C3); red 
(unique  C4); purple ( C5 unique ); brown ( combinations all runs with at least one of C2, C3 or C4), white (other 
combination s). The reader is referred to SM 5 for additional time steps .  
Physical reproducibility  with increasing reservoir complexity  
We inv estigat e the reproducib ility between five runs in the same geometry , with the hypothesis t hat 
increased reservoir complexity tend s to reduce the degree of physical reprod ucibility . As mentioned 
above , our motivation to achieve a physical “ground truth ” was not fully  achieved . This  was because 
our ‘identical ’ experiments in deed were not truly identical , even if the gas injection protocol  was 
(within measurement uncertainty , cf. SM 4). Next , we describe the two known  variables  that influence 
the displacement  patterns :  
1. Inconsistent  water chemistry . The formation water (cf. Table 1) in run C1 unintentionally  used 
tap water  instead  of deionized  water . The inconsistent  water chemistry  for C1 result ed in a 
unique  dissolution rate  and convective mixing  behavior (cf. Figure SM.3). Run C1 is thus 
omitted  from  the analysis  of physical  reproducibility . 
2. Atmos pheric pressure variations . The atmospheric pressure variations in Berge n (cf. Figure  
SM.1) resulted in a low-pressure outli er for run  C5 (968 mbar ) com pared with the other runs 
(on average 999 mbar  injection period , cf. Table SM  1). Hence, the larger volume of the 
injected CO 2 (equal mass injected for all ru ns) influence d key parameters in the experiment  
(most prominently  parameter 2 in Table 3, but also rate of dissolution ). Run C5 is thus  omitted 
from  the analysis  of physical reproducibility . 
 
The described  operational (water chemistry ) and environmental  (atmospheric pres sure ) 
inconsistencies  provide  the rationale  for excluding C1 and C5 in our analysis of physical reproducibility  
for operationally identical  experiments with comparable  pres sure and t emperature conditions.  An 
analysis of sand settling between  runs showed only min or changes (cf. SM 6). Hence,  we focus  on runs 
with  comparable  system parameters , and report the development  in overlap between runs C2, C3 and 
C4 (cf. Figure 9 ). To compute the overlap percentages , we first weight all pixels in the segmented 
images with their corresponding vo lume  (see SM 2). Then, the ratio between the number of volume -
weighted pixels where CO 2 (gas and dissolved)  in C2, C3, and C4 overlap and the number of volume -
weighted pixels where CO 2 (gas and dissolved) in any of the three runs appear is reported.  Next, we 
describe the de velopment in physical overlap within B ox A, Box B ’ and Box D.  
 
The development in physical  overlap in  Box A may be divided  into four  intervals : i. pre-spilling ; ii. 
gravitational fingers , iii. dissolution -driven flow  and iv. homogenization . The pre-spilling  interval (from 
the injection start  to approximately  4 hours ) occur red before the gas column height exceed ed the spill 
point . The onset of gravitational fingers oc curred in this inte rval, but they  are still  only minor and do 
not develop into pronounced  gravit ational fingers . The overlap increased from injection  start and 
reach ed a global  maximum (97 % overlap) after approximately  4 hours , with an a verage 92 % C2,3,4 
overlap for the wh ole interval . The uniqueness  of runs C2, C3 and C4 were on average 0.14 % (cf. Figure  
SM.4) during the pre-spilling  period . The gravitational fingers  interval (approximately 4  to 30 hours ) 
was characterized by development  of pronounced gravitational fingers under the gas accumulation in 
the anticline trap in Box A. The physical overlap  of C2,3,4 decreased from 97 to 79 % (local minimum ), 
dominated by the differences in number of fingers and individual finger dyna mics  (discussed in more 
detail below ). The dissolution -driven fl ow interval  (approximately  30 to 70 hours)  describe s the period 
when the gravitational fingers reached t he no -flow at the lower Box A boundary , and fingers start to 
move lateral and merge as the gas accumulation  dissolves and  pull aqueous phase from surrounding  
regions int o Box  A. The physical  overlap increased  to above 95  % in this per iod. The homogen ization  
interval ( approximately  70 to 120 h ours)  was characterized by a constant physical  overlap (above 95  
%) with only minor movement  of aqueous  phases confined in Box A.  
 
Box B ’ generall y follows the overall behavior o f Box A in the four intervals defined above . Importantly , 
the reduction  in physical overlap observe d in the gravitational fingers  interval  (after approximately 4 16 
 hours) was related to variable spilling times for runs C 2, C3  and C4 , not related to finger development  
(cf. parameter 2, Table 3 that approx imate s the spilling time  for each run) . The varia tion in spil l times  
resulted initially  in reduced overlap with slight variation in fault migration and displacement  patterns 
for run s C2,C3 and C 5. The sustained reduction of physical  over lap stems from an apparent  stochastic  
variation for run  C3 (cf. Figure SM .3; 10 hours) , corroborated with development of  the uniqueness for 
each run (cf. Figure SM .4; middle). The physical  explanation  for the observed variation  in run C3  is not 
clear , but this only occurred for that single run , with subsequent run s (C4 and C 5) reverting to the flow 
patterns seen for  the ear lier runs (C1 and C2) . Hence , we do not expect the deviation in ru n C3 to stem 
from any physical alterations within the experiment (sand settling, or chemical alterations) . Remaining 
explanations could be related to variations in atmospheric  pressure, or factors outside our 
experimental control .  
The development in Box D  was delayed in time relat ive to Box A and Box D due to  the later injection 
start of well [17,11] , but follows the ove rall trend : initially increasing overlap, slight reduction  due to 
finger development  and convective mixing , then increase through homogenization.  Small amounts of 
dissolved gas w ere obser ved in a localized point the top regional seal contained in Bo x D for mos t runs 
(cf. Figure SM 3 ). The seal breach occurred  around a plugged port (CO 2 migrated along the sealing 
silicone ), resembling  a of CO2 lea kage  scenario  along a p oorly abandoned  well.

geometry ( dashed line) is included for comparison.   
Dyna mics of gravitational fingers in Box C   
Box C is the homogenous zone under the lower anticline under the main gas accumulation  and where 
most of  the gravitational  fingers emerge during and a fter CO2 injection.  From imag e an alysis it was 
possible to extract the development  of fingers as a function of time for all runs  (cf. Figure 10 ). The 
fingers  appear after an onset time of approximately  3 hours, and the number is reasonably stable  
aroun d 25 -30, which corresponds to a characteristic spacing of about 5-6 cm. The stability of the 
number of fingers is an indication that the system is near the regime of the “maximally unstable ” 
fingers spacing, predicted by theoretical considerations (see e.g. Riaz et al 2006; Elenius  et al 2012 ). 
This observation is supported by the finger length s, whic h indicate a linear growth regime after onset . 
Repeat ability was observed in terms of onset loca tion and finger dynamics, even at time significantly 
after on set (cf. Figure SM .5 and Table  SM.3).

Oscillating CO2 leakage from anticli ne  
The benchma rk geometr y and  injection protocol were desig ned to a chieve realistic displacement 
proc esses relevant for subsur face carbon storage , where most  observed phenomena  and mass transfer 
dynami cs were  anticipated ; showcased in the description of expected  behavior  (cf. chapter 2. 4) and 
benchmark description [Nordbotten et al 2022 ]. An oscillating CO2 spilling event from the lower 
anticline  was observed in our study , something  that was not anticipate d. Non-monotonic  leakage 
behavior  has previously been suggested in the literature (Preuss 200 5), and in natural analogu es 
(Shipt on et al, 2004 ), attributed  to the i nterplay between multiphase  flow , Joule -Thomson cooling , and 
heat transfer effects  in the f ault plane . To our knowledge , oscillating CO 2 leakage behavior  from an 
anticline  into a fault zone in the absence  of thermal effe cts has not previously  been observed  
experimental ly nor receive d attention  in the literature . Below we discuss the displacement  dynamics 
during multiphase flow in the fault plane  generating  the observed oscillating  anticli ne CO 2 leakage  
behavior.        
The mass of mo bile gas in Box A oscillated after  the initial  spilling event  for all run s (cf. Figure 11 ). The 
gas escape s the anticline trap in burst s and f lows into the narrow restriction at the bottom of the faul t 
(aligned in height with the spill point) . When gas migrates upward in the fault zone (essentially a 
localized permeable pathway ), it displace s resident aqueous  fluids downwards . The inflow of aqueous 
phase effectively reduce s and ultimately  blocks the upwa rds migration of gas . This is in essence  
because the localized pathwa y in the inlet region of the fault  cannot accommodate  stable counter -
current flow  (upwards gas flow and downwa rds water flow ), possibly due to viscous coupling effects  
(see e.g. th e review paper by Ayub and Bentsen, 1999 ). When the upwards migrati on of gas i s 
temporarily  blocked, the anticline gas column height increases  again with continued  CO 2 injection . The 
process then repeat s itse lf when the aque ous phase flow dissipates . A secondary e ffect  is that the 
inflowing aqu eous phase  increase s the local water saturation between the spill point and the inlet 
poin t of the fault  and traps gas. The gas  quickly dissolve s into aqueous phase , and the subsequent  
spilling event s (up to four events per run ) are essentiall y local drain age process es, characterized  by 
oscil lating mass of mobile gas under the anticline (Box  A). Interestingly, the process appear s hyster etic 
in nature , with decreas ing peak mass values for each event , most likely  related either to increased gas 
relative permeability between the spill point and the fault , or changes in the local CO 2 concentra tion 
in the aqueous phase . The fluctuations stopped wh en the CO 2 injection  terminated  (afte r 
approximately 300 min , cf. SM 4 ), and the gas colu mn heigh t (and, hence, the mass of mobile gas) 
decrease d under the spilling point . 
18 
 To generalize the underly ing causes f or the observed phen ome non is difficult based on the reported 
experime nts alone , and should be coupled with dedicated numerical simulations including  more 
effects. The observ ation s are t o some degree influence d by th e physical system (no -flow boundar ies 
in the vicinity of the spill point and fault , and the fault geometry aligned with the spill point acting as a 
restriction of upwards  migration of gas) and presence and shape of the gas accumulation effectively 
reduc ing the area available for water flow . A systematic evaluation of the cycli c behavior including 
coupled  processes and parameters of the problem remains a task  for future work.  
 
Figure 11 . – Fluctuations in mass of mob ile gas [g] in Box A after initial  spilling e vent . The mass curves all 
demonstrate oscillations  due to  recurring spilling events  from the an ticline to the adjacent fault . For all runs, the 
maximum mass was observed before the initial gas escape . The lower atmospheric pressure for run C5 (purp le 
circles ) results in a lower initial  spilling time . 
4. Concl uding re marks  
The open -access , high -quality  laboratory  data set, accompan ied with dedicated analysis tools, 
represents an asset  and opportunity  for the carbon storage community to expand the current  analysis 
in future studies . The physical data , describing  many o f the relevant  processes for subsurface carbon 
storage , may  also be used for model validation , comparison,  and data -driven forecast s for different  
stages of a carbon storage operation . Blue prints  of the experimental infrastructure enhance 
reproducibility of scientific research, and enable  the porous media community  at large to build physical 
asset s and collectively join our efforts . 
Our outlook , based on the observations identified in this study,  is to probe the origin and 
premises for establishing non -thermally induced oscillating flows , and to  broaden the understanding 
of at what length scales and to what accuracy multiphase flows in porous media are deterministic .  
In conclusion, the observed processes and phenomena qualitatively corroborates the physical 
understanding and knowledge  within the carbon storage community . This supports the assertion that 
we have a  sufficient  understanding to claim that  industrial carbon s torage operations can be conducted 
in an efficient and safe manner.

 SM 3 – Image analysis a ssumpt ions  
A range of assumptions (I. to V.) was needed to quanti tatively describe the observed multiphase flow 
phenomena during repeated CO 2 injections in the physical flow rig . Based  on these assumptions, a 
geometric separation of the formation water  from  any CO 2 in the system  and of the gaseous CO 2 from  
the CO 2-saturated water is sufficient . 
 
I. we assume that gas -filled regions are 100% saturated with the gas (CO 2) 
Note:  we physically understand that there is a non -zero  irreducible water saturation (Swi) 
present in parts of the gas saturated regions.  The regions with free  gas (predominantly 
under the lower anticline  seal) have a non -zero water content due to i.) solu bility of water 
in CO 2 (the gas travels some distance f rom injection well  [9,3]  through a water -saturated 
region before it accumulates) and ii.) an irreducible  water saturation  may be present, 
determined by th e capillary drainage curve and the ‘wetness ’ of the gas displacing water. 
Neither i) nor ii) can accur ately be quantified in our setup , and we make  a general 
assumption that  Swi = 0 in gas-filled regions.  
 
II. we assume a constant CO 2 concentration in the CO 2-saturated water  
Note:  This is a data limitation rather than an assumption , as we expect a CO 2 concent ration 
gradient in CO 2-saturated water depending on the distance from the injector and time ; in 
particul ar, it is expected based on numerical simulatio ns that the concentration  in general 
will be variable within  in each gravitational finger  (Pau et al 20 10). In most experimental 
runs , however,  we observed mineralization of methyl red from the blend of pH sensitive 
dyes in the formation water . Hence, the antic ipated relationship between color change 
and CO 2 concentration (due to pH changes) cou ld not be quantified . 
   
III. we do not account for the dynamics of the gas partitioning in the gas accumula tion  
Note:  The formation water was in equilibrium with the atmosphere and contained 
dissolved atmospheric gases (predominantly nitrogen and oxygen). The CO 2 mass transfer 
from gaseous phase to the formation water releases nitrogen and oxygen into the gase ous 
phase. H ence, over time the gaseous phase in the system becomes deprived of CO 2, with 
reduced solubility in water.  We estimate the amount of atmosphe ric gases in observed 
gaseous phase after the experiment.  
 
IV. we can accurately calculate the volume of C O2 injected during each run  
Note : The mass flow controller ensures that the mass of CO 2 injected in each run is identical 
(within instrument uncertainty) . The volume of the injected CO 2 is, however, influenced by 
the system pressure and temperature . The l ogged atmospheric  pressure du ring the 
injection phase (average for entire injection period) is used , together with the hydrostatic 
pressure, to calculate the inject ed CO 2 volume  for each run, assuming uniform and 
constant temperature .  
  
V. we have accurate information about porosity and  depth  
Note : the experimentally measured porosity values for each sand type represent the 
porosity  in the FluidFlower rig,  and we  assum e that the porosity is  uniform  in each layer. 
The variable depth measured after completion o f all runs is representative  for all runs, with 
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation  between measured locations. The depth and 
porosity are used  to calculate the pore volume in each sand layer .  
 
  23 
 SM 4 – Fluid i njection protocol s   
Here we briefly describe the two main gaseous and aqueous injection protocols used during the 
benchmark study .  
Gaseous phase  injection protocol  
Gaseous CO 2 was inje cted using a mass flow controller ( EL-FLOW Prestige FG-201CV 0 -10 ml s/min , 
BronkHorst ) with a constant mass per time injection rate equal to 10.000 ± 0.0002 mls/min  using th e 
following injectio n protocol (c f. Figure 1  for injection well positions ):  
1. Inject CO 2 in well [9,3]; duration 300 minutes  
2. Inject CO 2 in well [17,7] with 135 minutes  delay  relative to well [9,3] ; duration 165 minutes  
3. Stop  CO 2 injections in wells  [9,3] and [17,7]  simultaneous ly  
4. Monitor CO 2 flow, convection, trapping and dissolution for 120 hours ( five days )  
Note : the injection time in well [9,3] is 304.5 min  due to ramping : increased from 1 to 10 ml s/min over 
the firs t 4.5 min  (1 ml s/min increments every 30 sec) . At the end of CO 2 injection , the delivery rate 
likewise decreased . Hence, t he total injection time of 304.5 min with up/ down ramping equals 300 
min wit h constant 10 mls/min.  A similar approach was used for CO 2 injection in well [17,7] , where 
injection time with ramp ing ( 169.5 min ) equal s 165 min with 10 mls/min delivery rate.   
 
The injected CO 2 mass is the same for each run: well [15,5] = 5.5167  g; well [17,11] = 2.94224 g; total 
CO 2 mass injected = 8.45894  g. The  mass es are calculated  multiplying the injection time (min), delivery 
rate (ml s/min) and density (g/ml), where ρCO2 at standard conditions is 0.0018389 g/ml [Lemmon et al. 
2022 ]. mls equals ml/min at standard conditions : T = 20 °C and P = 1013 mbar .  
 
Aqueous phase injection protocol  
The protocol below describes the prep aratory steps  before CO 2 injection  and how to reset the  fluids in 
the geometry for repeated runs. All aqueous phases were delivered to the flow rig with a piston  pump 
(QX-1500, Chandler Engineering ). The following steps were performed:  
1. Prepare for CO 2 injection and s aturate the porous media : inject formation wa ter with 50 
ml/min injection rate through the seven ports in the technical  row at the bottom of the rig . 
Port position s (open/close) was varied  sequentially to achieve an effective miscible 
displacem ent process.  
2. Maintain fixed water table height : recircul ate formation water  (injection rate  50 ml/min ) in 
the top technical row during CO 2 injection  and dissolution  
3. Remove gas and CO 2-saturated water  after CO 2 experiment : inject lye solution with 50 ml/mi n 
through the seven ports in the bottom technical row .  
4. Repeat steps 1 -3.

 SM 6 Sand sedimentation  
Using the image analysis capabilities of DarSIA, it is possible to detect minute structura l changes the sand facies 
over ti me, resulting in a local deformation map  matching the pore  spaces  of two images . The multi -level  feature 
detection  methodology , as detailed in  [Nordbotten et al. 20 23], allows for an accurate analysis on the resolution 
of grain s. Using thi s methodology, we can investigate sand sedimentation occurring  over the course of the various 
experimental runs, to assess whether the geometry has sedimented to a final configuration modulo insignificant 
variations. This is particularly important for disc ussing physical variability of the  different experimental runs.  
To assess the significance of sand sedimentation in between two operational runs and over the experimental 
study, we study the effective displacement between two runs (C1 and C2 ) and total displacement  (between C1 
and C5 ) cf. Figure SM.5. The maximal  observed sedimentation occurs on the order  of 1.7 mm and 5.5 mm for the 
two respective options. We conclude that the changes in the geometry are insignificant in terms of  their effect 
on the flow behavior.  
 
 
Figure SM .6 - Sand sedimenta tion d uring CO2 injections . Top: Deformation aligning pore spaces the geometries 
at injection start of runs C1 and C2. The effective sedimentation is most significant along the sides of the 
geometry  as well as along the sealed  fault, with a maximal displacement of 1.7 mm . Bottom: Deformation aligning 
pore spaces the geometries at injection start of runs C1 and C5, illustrating the overall sedimentation taking place 
over the course of the entire experimental  study. The maximal displace ment along the sides reaches values of 
5.5 mm .
