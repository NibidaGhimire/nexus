A prototype Dual Gain Multilayer Thick Gas Electron Multilyer (DG-M-THGEM)
with an active area of 10 cm 10 cm was manufactured aiming at the production of
a large-volume active-target time projection chamber which can work under the condi-
tion of high-intensity heavy-ion beam injections. The DG-M-THGEM has a alternating
structure of electrodes and insulators. Eective gas gains of two regions, which are called
beam and recoil regions, are separately controlled. Performance of the prototype DG-
M-THGEM in hydrogen gas at a pressure of 40 kPa was evaluated. Irradiating a132Xe
beam, an eective gas gain lower than 100 with a charge resolution of 3% was achieved in
the beam region while the eective gas gain of 2000 was maintained in the recoil region.
Position distributions of measured charges along the beam axis were investigated in
order to evaluate gain uniformity in the high intensity beam injection. The gain shift
was estimated by simulations considering space charges in the drift region. The gain
shift was suppressed within 3% even at the beam intensity of 2 :5106particles per
second.

1. Introduction
Gaseous active targets based on time projection chambers (TPCs) [1{6] as three dimensional
tracking detector have been widely developed to perform experimental studies in inverse
kinematics in various accelerator facilities. Gaseous active target plays an important role
to measure forward-angle inelastic scattering of medium-heavy, especially unstable, nuclei
in inverse kinematics. The reaction vertex can be determined by reconstructing trajectories

tering measurements involved by light nuclei such as proton, deuteron and particles at
incident energies of 100 - 300 MeV/nucleon are well known methods to determine transi-
tion strength of isovector-dipole and isoscalar-monopole states [7{16]. As radioactive isotope
(RI) beams of medium-heavy nuclei, such as132Sn region, with higher-intensity over 1 105
particles per second (pps) are becoming available at the energies for inverse-kinematics
measurements of inelastic scatterings, the needs of active targets that can work under the
condition of such high-intensity beam irradiation are increasing.
Strong ionization induced by heavy-ion and high-intensity beams are discussed in Ref. [17],
where the risk of sparks and malfunctioning of the detector are pointed out. The large
number of the ionized electrons also inclease backow ions from multiplication part. The
backow ions distort electric eld in drift region and reduce the accuracy of the trajectory
deduction. In order to reduce these eects, the electrons and ions emerging inside an active
area has to be controlled, especially along the beam trajectories. For example, the electrons
and ions created by the beam particles are isolated from the drift region by placing plates in
MAYA [17,18], and by surrounding the beam axis with wire rings in TACTIC [19]. They can
accept the high-intensity beams up to 5 107pps, but they are not sensitive to the beam
tracks. We tried to reduce electrons by means of a mesh grid covering the gas multiplication
part [20] in our active target, called CAT-S [21]. The CAT-S with the mesh grid could detect
beam trajectories, but the charge resolution was not better than 10%, which was required
to achieve the aiming position resolution of 1 mm.
For improving charge resolution of the CAT-S, we developed a Dual-Gain Thick Gas
Electron Multiplier (DG-THGEM) [21]. The electrodes of the DG-THGEM at both sides
are segmented to have individual gas gains for beam and recoil regions. Independent gas
gains of 1102and 5103were realized for beam and recoil regions, respectively. The
charge resolution better than 10% for the beam region was achieved. CAT-S with DG-
THGEM could work under the condition of irradiation of RI beams including132Sn at the
high intensity of 3 :5105pps [22].
Now, we are developing a new active target TPC, named CAT-M, which has an active
area of 30 cm30 cm larger than CAT-S with an active area of 10 cm 10 cm, to
increase the target thickness and the acceptance for reaction events. It is necessary to employ
sucient thickness of GEMs for enlarging active area in CAT-M, because its self-weight and
Coulomb force acting between electrodes may deform itself. A Multilayer THGEM (M-
THGEM) developed by Cortesi et al. [23] has an alternating structure of the electrodes and
insulators. This has sucient thickness to resist the deformation.
We designed a new multilayer THGEM with a capability of the dual gain. We call it Dual
Gain Multilayer Thick GEM (DG-M-THGEM). In the present work, the prototype DG-M-
THGEM with a same active area with CAT-S of 10 cm 10 cm was used to investigate
the gain stability and charge responses with high-intensity heavy-ion beam injection. The
structure of the prototype DG-M-THGEM is described in Section 2. The measured eective
gas gain and charge resolution of the DG-M-THGEM using a heavy-ion beam and the gain
shift as a function of the beam intensity are shown in Section 3. The Summary is given in
Section 4.
2/192. Structure of prototype DG-M-THGEM
Figure 1 shows schematic drawings and photographs of the prototype DG-M-THGEM. It
was designed by ourselves and produced by REPIC Co. Ltd, Japan. The prototype DG-M-
THGEM has an alternating structure of four sheets of electrodes and three plate of insulators.
Hereafter, four electrodes are denoted by L 1, L2, L3and L 4. The present production process is
as following; rst, two substrates with electrode copper layers on both sides were produced,
i.e., one has the electrodes L 1and L 2, and the other has the electordes L 3and L 4. The
thicknesses of copper electrode and FR4 insulator are 0.032 mm and 0.40 mm respectively.
Then a 0.3-mm thick FR4 plate was sandwiched by these two substrates and bonded with
0.04-mm-thick epoxy-resin glue. The actual thickness of the middle substrate is 0.38 mm
including the glue thickness. And nally, GEM holes were drilled piercing from L 1to L 4. The
geometry pattern of GEM holes is shown in Fig. 2. The diameter and the pitch of the hole
are 0.3 mm and 0.7 mm, respectively. A nominal total thickness of the prototype DG-M-
THGEM is 1.312 mm. The actual thickness was measured at six points which are indicated
in the view of the drift region side of Fig. 1 (a). Table 1 shows the measured thickness of
each point with a caliper. The value of each point is an average of the three measurements.
The average thickness at the six measured points is 1.298 mm and the maximum dierence
among the measured points is 0.002 mm. The size of the substrate is 124 mm 160 mm,
and the area of the active region is approximately 100 mm 100 mm. The electrodes L 1
and L 4are closest to the drift and the induction regions, respectively. The electrodes L 2, L3
and L 4are divided into three parts. The center one is called \beam region", and the two
side ones are called \recoil region". The beam region is 20-mm wide to cover the envelope of
the beam, and each recoil region is 40-mm wide. There are 2.12 mm width gaps between the
beam and recoil regions. The electrode L 1is not segmented in order to avoid the charge up
of the insulator. As shown in photograph of Fig. 1 (b), protective resistors and stabilization
capacitors are soldered on the insulator board.

3. Performances of prototype DG-M-THGEM
For performance evaluations of the prototype DG-M-THGEM, two experiments were carried
out. First, eective gas gain of the prototype DG-M-THGEM was measured with various
bias settings using an source of241Am in a test bench chamber. Second, the prototype
DG-M-THGEM was installed in the CAT-S chamber. The eective-gas-gain stabilities and

3.1. Eective gas gain evaluated using241Amsource
A schematic view of the experimental setup to measure the eective gas gain using the241Am
source (0.98 kBq at the time of this experiment) is shown in Fig. 3. The test bench was
installed in a cylindrical chamber with the inner diameter of 24 cm and the height of 12 cm.
In the chamber, the hydrogen gas owed at the rate of approximately 100 cm3/min. The gas
pressure was monitored at the inlet and the outlet position of the chamber with dierential
pressure gauges with the accuracy of 0.1 kPa. Oxygen concentration in the chamber was also
monitored periodically at the outlet position and 0.01% lower limit of the monitor or less of
the oxygen concentration was kept. A cathode plate was placed above L 1with distance of
20 mm from surface of L 1. Drift eld for electrons was formed by L 1and the cathode plate.
Theparticles, which were collimated by a PTFE collimator with the length of 50 mm and
the inner diameter of 4 mm, were injected to the drift eld. The particles were injected to
the recoil region and passed through 10 mm above L 1. A readout board was placed 2 mm
below the surface of L 4. On the readout board, 36 square-shaped copper pads, each of which
has a 15 mm15 mm area, were arranged in 6 rows and 6 columns with interval gaps of
1 mm. One pad, hereafter called readout pad, shown as lled rectangle in Fig. 3 (a) was
connected to a readout circuit. The other pads were all grounded. The distance between the
center of the readout pad and the surface of the source was 60.5 mm. The energy deposit
ofparticle passing through the area corresponding to the readout pad was calculated to
5/19be 115 keV by LISE++ [24]. The collected electrons on the readout pad were integrated
with a charge-sensitive preamplier, REPIC RPA-211. Conversion gain was modied to be
400 mV/pC and a time-constant of 80 ns. The output signal from the preamplier was
pulse-shaped by a shaping amplier, ORTEC 572A, and its pulse height was recorded by
a multi-channel analyzer, Kromek 102 product of Kromek Group plc. In order to convert
the pulse height to the absolute charge value, the circuit system was calibrated by a pulser
module and charge injector (capacitance).
Figure 4 shows resistor chain to supply biases for the cathode plate and the electrodes of
the prototype DG-M-THGEM. The bias V Cis for the cathode. The bias to each electrode of
the prototype DG-M-THGEM was supplied by V GEM through a resistor divider. It should
be noticed that the beam and recoil regions had the same bias in the present test. The eld
strength in the drift region, which was determined by the biases of the cathode plate and
L1, was controled by combination of V Cand V GEM in order to keep to be 1 kV/cm/atm,
i.e. V GEM and V Cwere simultaneously changed from -1725 V to -1975 V and -2525 V to
-2775 V in 25 V steps, respectively. The drift velocity of electrons is estimated to be 1 s/cm
at the present eld strength by a simulation program, Gareld++ [30]. As shown in Fig. 1,
the distances between L 1- L2and L 3- L4are same, but one of L 2- L3is dierent from
them; therefore, the resistor chain was adjusted so that electric elds of L 1- L2, L2- L3and
L3- L4have same strength.
The eective gas gain Geis dened as a ratio of QmeastoQin,
Ge=Qmeas
Qin; (1)
whereQmeas is the measured charge from the readout pad and Qinis the initial charge.
Qinis calculated by the elementary charge, e, stopping power of particle though the gas,
dE=dx , mean energy for ion-electron pair creation, W, and path length of particle,dX.
Qinis described as following,
Qin=e
WdE
dxdX; (2)
where we used W = 36.5 eV [27] for hydrogen gas, and dX= 15 mm of the length of the
readout pad. Ambiguity of dXis estimated to be within 0.01 mm, because the particles
were collimated, and the angular dispersion is up to 2.3 degree. Therefore, the dXis assumed
to be same as the length of the readout pad.
Figure 5 shows the eective gas gain as a function of reduced bias. The reduced bias is
derived by dividing the electric eld strength between L 1and L 4with the distance between
these electrodes of 0.12 cm and the gas pressure. The gas pressure was monitored in each
measurement and it varied between 39.80 kPa and 40.19 kPa. Our required eective gas gain
for the recoil region is more than 2 103, which was achieved with the reduced bias above
360 kV/cm/kPa. In the present condition, we could not obtain the eective gas gain over
5:31103due to discharges.
3.2. Eective gas gain and charge resolution using heavy ion beam
Measurement of eective gas gain and charge resolution using heavy-ion beam (the program
number 15H307) was performed at a synchrotron accelerator facility, Heavy Ion Medical
Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC), National Institutes for Quantum Science and Technology

(QST).132Xe beam with the energy of 185 MeV/nucleon from the synchrotron accelera-
tor was introduced from the end of the beam transport line to experimental setup and
injected into the CAT-S. The repetition time of the synchrotron was 3.3 second. So-called
slow-extraction mode was applied to have the moderate and uniform intensity for a certain
duration. The typical extraction duration was 1.5 second. The number of the132Xe particles
in each beam pulse was monitored with a diamond detector [25] located 1077-mm upstream
of the CAT-S. The position distribution of the beam was measured with two low-pressure
multi-wire drift chambers (MWDCs) [26] which were installed Z=672 mm and Z=1034 mm
downstream of the CAT-S. Here we dene the beam axis as Z. the horizontal axis as X, and
the vertical axis as Y. Their origins are set to the center of the CAT-S active area.
Conguration of the CAT-S with the prototype DG-M-THGEM is shown in Fig. 6. It
should be noticed that the conguration is upside down from Fig 3. Cathode plate of drift
eld is not drawn in Fig. 6. The gas pressure and ow rate were 40 kPa and 100 cm3/min,
respectively. The oxygen concentration was kept at 0.01% lower limit of the monitor or less.
The drift eld formed by the CAT-S eld cage was set to be 1 kV/cm/atm. Thus, the esti-
mated drift velocity of electron was 1 s/cm, as was the case with the test bench experiment.

The electrons drift toward +Y direction. An anode mesh was installed at 16.2 mm below
L1. The anode mesh is made of SUS304. The diameter and the pitch of the wires of the
anode mesh are 30 m and 254 m, respectively. The electric eld strength between the
anode mesh and L 1was 2.39 kV/cm/atm. Readout electrode was mounted at 2 mm above
L4. There are 416 readout pads, which has an equilateral triangle shape of 7-mm side formed
on PCB. The beam was injected at 66.2 mm below L 1in the beam region. Each readout
pad was connected to the preamplier RPA-211. The output signals of the preamplier were
digitized by V1740 ash Analoge-to-Degital convertor (FADC), CAEN Co. Ltd. The sam-
pling rate was 50 MHz. The total charge read by the pad was obtained by summing up the
samples. The obtained total charge was calibrated using the pulse pulser module and the
charge injector.
Figure 7 shows resistor conguration to supply biases to the electrodes of the prototype
DG-M-THGEM. The biases to L 1and L 2of the recoil region were supplied by V 1through the
resistor chains. The biases to other electrodes, L 3and L 4of the recoil region, and L 2, L3, L4of
the beam region, were supplied by V 3R, V4R, V2B, V3B, and V 4B, respectively. Consequently,
the gas gain of the beam region and the recoil region can be controlled independently.
The denition of the eective gas gain is the same as Eq. (1). The Qininduced by the
132Xe beam was estimated similarily from the stopping power dE=dx which was calculated
with LISE++ but with considering escape energy carried by delta rays. If the delta rays

escape from a region of interest, the measured energy deposit become lower than energy
loss. The energy carried by the delta-rays was estimated using GEANT4 [31]. Considering
both results of simulation and measurement, it is turned out that the ratio of the escaped
energy relevant to the energy loss, e, is 18.7% for the132Xe beam. In addition, charges
measured by each readout pad are modied from the energy deposit due to diusion eect
in the drift region. The ratio of the charge measured by each readout pad to the energy
deposit,d, was estimated by tting the calculated charges in the readout pads along the
trajectory to the measured charges. The Qinis modied from Eq. 2 as following,

Note that the eis expected to zero for the low-energy alpha particles. The dis expected
to be one when the readout pad has translational symmetry and the change of the stopping
power is small enough comparing to the energy deposit.
The eective gas gain in the beam region was measured by varying biases. Figure 8 shows
the measured eective gas gain as a function of the reduced biases with the low-intensity
beam of 5103particles per pulse. The eective gas gains were derived by averaging over
all of the 52 readout pads in the beam region. The bias setting is summarized in Table 2. It
was reported that lower bias applying to rst multiplier stage, which corresponds between L 1
and L 2, can control ion backow [23]. We tried to apply slightly lower bias to nal multiplier
stage of L 3-L4in the beam region by varying only V 4Bwhile xing V 1, V2Band V 3B, aiming
to supress the ion back-ow. The biases of the recoil region, V 3Rand V 4Rwere xed to make
electric elds between each electrodes have same strength. The eective gas gain lower than

the next subsection.

Charge resolution was also derived with the same bias setting of Table 2. In the present
analysis, the charge resolution dened as following; pads were formed in a group dened as
shown in Fig. 9 (a). Neighboring four triangles are in one group. The collected charge by
i-th group is denoted by Qi. Index,i, is ordered along Z axis, from 0 to 12. All the Qiis
expected to be the same for all i-th groups, because the beam energy was suciently high
and its stopping power was constant at 94.3 keV/mm within 0.2% overall the active area.
Thus, we dened a residual of Qias following,

The charge resolutions as a function of the eective gas gain are shown in Fig. 9 (b).
The charge resolutions were derived averaging of the 11 groups along Z axis. The charge
resolutions signicantly depend on the eective gas gain. This indicates that the charge

resolution is mainly determined by the statistics of the number of amplied electrons. The
charge resolution much smaller than 10% is achieved over all eective-gas-gain region.
3.3. Test with high-intensity beam
In this subsection, sensitivity of the eective gas gain for the beam intensity was discussed
assuming the bean intensity dependence of the eective gas gain and the initial charge, as
described in the following equation which modied from the Eq. (1),
Qmeas=Ge(Ibeam)Qin(Ibeam): (5)
Therefore we consider that the QinandGeare treated as a function of the beam intensity,
Ibeam. Ideally the Qmeas should not be changed by Ibeam, but it has sensitivities for Ibeam
through this equation.
The beam intensity has a time structure within the extraction duration. Figure 10 shows
the beam intensity distributions within the extraction duration when the integrated intensity
was 1106particles per pulse. Horizontal axis shows the time in one beam duration and the
origin of the time is arbitrary. Vertical axis is averaged beam intensity in each time bin. The

Assuming that Ge(Ibeam) was not so sensitive for the beam intensity, i.e. Ge(Ibeam) =
Gnom, we derive Qin m(Ibeam) =Qmeas=Gnomas shown in Fig. 11. Here we presumed the
nominal eective gas gain, Gnom= 76:7, was the eective gas gain obtained in low-intensity
132Xe beam experiment at the supplied bias of 323 V between L 3and L 4in the beam region.
Figure 11 shows Qin m(Ibeam) depends not only on the beam intensity but also the position
along the beam axis (Z). As the beam intensity increases, Qin m(Ibeam) increases overall Z.
The distribution has a parabolic shape with a symmetry at Z = 0.
To explain this parabolic shape, we employed \ion pillar model" [28]. The ion pillar model
has been proposed to evaluate electric eld distortion in the drift region caused by the

ion-backow from GEMs. The backow ions move from the GEMs to the cathode, then a
pillar of positive ions along the beam trajectory is formed. In the previous studies, electric
eld distortion in the drift direction (Y direction) has been discussed, but similar electric
eld distortion also occurs along the beam axis (Z direction) and its vertical direction (X
direction). The ions attract drifting electrons from outside the beam region, consequently
Qin m(Ibeam) increases in the beam region. The number of the ions increases with increment
of the beam intensity, the behavior of Qin m(Ibeam) in Fig. 11 can be explained. Figure 12
shows the comparison of beam prole on the X axis which is measured by the CAT-S and the
MWDCs. The beam prole measured by the MWDCs shows the similar size independent of
the beam intensity. However, ones measured by the CAT-S was observed to become narrow
according the beam intensity, because the attracted electrons converge on the beam axis.
The eect of ions in the pillar on electrons which reach to L 1was investigated by electron-
drift simulation. The ion density in the pillar was assumed to be distributed homogeneously
in the Z and Y direction and Gaussian in the X direction. The beam was injected 5 cm below
L1. The distance from L 1to the cathode plane of the eld cage was approximately 250 mm.
The drift velocities of a hydrogen ion and an electron were 0.01 cm/ s and 1.2 cm/ s,
respectively. Thus the time for the back-ow ions to reach the cathode was approximately
3 ms. As shown in Table 3, the time bin for each beam intensity was from about 20 ms to
200 ms. Therefore, the number of the ions in the pillar was considered to be immediately
saturated depending on the beam intensity within the time bin. The number of the electrons
reaching to L 1along the beam trajectory, Qin s(Ibeam), was derived by the electron-drift
simulation with Gareld++ [30] while varying the amount of ions in the pillar.

To reproduce Qin m(Ibeam) in Fig.11, we explain Qin m(Ibeam) usingQin s(Ibeam) as
following,
Qin m(Ibeam) =Qmeas
Gnom=Qin s(Ibeam)Ge(Ibeam)
Gnom: (6)
We setQin s(Ibeam) andGe(Ibeam) as the tting parameters in least-square tting method
to reproduce the Qin m(Ibeam) in Fig.11. Because Qin s(Ibeam) is depending on the amount
of the ion in the pillar, the actual parameters to be varied are the amount of ions in the pillar
and the eective gas gain. Figure 13 (c) and (d) shows the tting results of the distributions of
the reduced 2as a function of the amount of the ion in the pillar and eective-gas-gain shift
for the beam intensities of 1 :2105and 2:5106pps, respectively. Here, the eective-gas-
gain shift is dened as fGe(Ibeam) Gnomg=Gnom. Searching 2minimum point on Fig. 13
(c), the number of the ion in the pillar and the eective-gas-gain shift are 2 :6102pC
and -1 %, respectively, Using these parameters, we can reproduce Qin m(Ibeam) spectrum
as shown Fig. 13 (a). Figure 13 (b) is also reproduced by 1 :38103pC and and 0.4%. This
result shows that the ion backow from the DG-M-THGEM is signicantly large to show its
eect. The required eective gas gain in the beam region was achieved with the dual gain
operation by the lower bias application between L 3and L 4in the beam region, however, the
ion backow eect was not suciently small.
Figure 14 shows the beam intensity dependence of the amount of ion in the pillar and
the eective-gas-gain shift. Comparing the beam intensity of 2 :5106pps with 1:2105,
its uctuation is suppressed within 3% while the amount of ion increases by seven times. It
was found that the amount of ion in the pillar was saturated above the beam intensity of
6105pps. It is considered due to decreasing the ion backow from the DG-M-THGEM as
the amount of ions in the pillar increases above a certain level, similar to the trend shown

in a previous study [29]. The uctuation of the eective gas gain was suciently suppressed
to the same level as the charge resolution at the eective gas gain of 1 102. As shown in
Fig. 12, the electrons attracted by the ion pillar to the beam center; therefore electron density
increased by a factor of 8.5 at 2 :5106pps comparing to at 1 103pps beam intensity. It
can be explained that the uctuations were suppressed to 3% even under conditions where
ionized electrons of 6 pc/cm2/s ow to the prototype DG-M-THGEM.
4. Summary
The prototype Dual Gain Multilayer Thick GEM (DG-M-THGEM) with the active area of
10 cm10 cm was produced and its performance was evaluated. The electrodes of multilayer
thick GEM, which has an alternating structure of electrodes and insulators, were segmented
to three regions. The center region and both sides can be applied biases independently
to control gas gains individually. The performance of the prototype DG-M-THGEM was
evaluated in the hydrogen gas at the pressure of 40 kPa. The eective gas gains as a function
of the reduced bias applied DG-M-THGEM were measured using the source of241Am.
The eective gas gain was achieved up to 5 :31103.
The eective gas gain and the charge resolutions in the beam region were evaluated using
the heavy-ion132Xe beam with the energy of 185 MeV/nucleon and intensity from 5 103
to 1106particles per pulse. The eective gas gain of lower than 1 102was achieved with
the charge resolution of smaller than 3 % in the beam region while maintaining the eec-
tive gas gain of 2 103in the recoil region. The eective-gas-gain stability with increasing
the beam intensity was also discussed. As the beam intensity increases, the initial charges
become larger, because the ion pillar attracts electrons. The eect shrinked the beam width

measrured by the CAT-S as the beam intensity increase. Even if increasing the beam inten-
sity from 1 :2105pps and 2:5106pps, the eective gas gain uctuate within only 3%
while the amount of ion increased by seven times. The eective-gas-gain uctuation was
suppressed to the same level as the charge resolution at the eective gas gain of 1 102.
The number of electrons around the beam center was about 8.5 times larger at 2 :5106pps
than at 1103pps due to the eect to attract electrons by the ion in the pillar. It can be
explain that the eective gas gain uctuate within 3% even under conditions where ionized
electrons of 6 pc/cm2/s ow to the prototype DG-M-THGEM. As a future issue, it is neces-
sary to develop a way to reduce the eect of the ion backow in order to perform accurate
tracking analysis of the trajectory.
