Preferential Attachment Clique Complexes

Abstract
The preferential attachment model is a natural and popular random graph model for
a growing network that contains very well-connected “hubs”. We study the higher-order
connectivity of such a network by investigating the topological properties of its clique
complex. We concentrate on the expected Betti numbers, a sequence of topological
invariants of the complex related to the numbers of holes of different dimensions. We
determine the asymptotic growth rates of the expected Betti numbers, and prove that
the expected Betti number at dimension 1 grows linearly fast, while those at higher
dimensions grow sublinearly fast. Our theoretical results are illustrated by simulations.
(Changes are made in this version to generalize Proposition 14 and to streamline proofs.
These changes are shown in blue.)
1 Introduction
From biology to the internet, real-world networks in a wide range of fields are believed to
bescale-free , in the sense that the degree distributions of these graphs obey certain power
laws, often with infinite variance. [Albert, 2005, Egu´ ıluz et al., 2005, Faloutsos et al., 1999,
Mislove et al., 2007, Gjoka et al., 2010, Caldarelli, 2007] In addition to the degree distribu-
tions of these networks, there has been significant interest in their higher-order connectivity,
defined in various ways. [Benson et al., 2016, Nolte et al., 2020, Lambiotte et al., 2019, Bat-
tiston et al., 2020, Bianconi, 2021] Some of these notions are graph-theoretic, like clustering
coefficients [Watts and Strogatz, 1998] and motif counts [Benson et al., 2016]. One may
also understand higher-order connectivity by viewing the network as a higher-dimensional
analogue of a graph, like a hypergraph or a simplicial complex . In particular, the Betti
numbers of simplicial complexes, a concept from algebraic topology, generalize the counts of
connected components and cycles to the counts of higher-dimensional holes, and they have
proven to be useful statistics in recent topological-data-analytic applications. [Aktas et al.,
2019, Carlsson, 2009, Chazal and Michel, 2021] For instance, it was observed that the way
holes emerge in (biological) neural networks helps distinguish different stimuli to the brains
of different animals. [Reimann et al., 2017] However, understanding Betti numbers is in
general difficult for conceptual, computational and analytical reasons. To the best of our
knowledge, there has been no analytical results on the Betti numbers of scale-free simplicial
complexes, with the notable exception of [Oh et al., 2021], which considers a 2-dimensional
model and determines the asymptotics of the Betti number at dimension 1.

When new nodes (drawn as people) in the left column are added to the network, they are
more likely to attach to already popular nodes (who have high degrees), like the light blue
person in the figure. Fully connected subsets of nodes form triangles, tetrahedra and their
higher-dimensional analogues in the clique complex. Note that in order to have triangles,
each new node must connect to at least 2 nodes, but we only draw one connection for each
new node to keep the illustration simple. (Right) The log-log plot of the evolution of the
mean Betti number at dimension 2 for 500 preferential attachment clique complexes. The
horizontal axis is the number of nodes in log-scale, the black curve corresponds to the mean
Betti number, in log scale as well. The dotted curves correspond to the mean upper and
lower bounds in our argument (specifically in Proposition 14). The slope of the shaded region
is the asymptotical growth rate of the expected Betti number. The position and the width
of the shaded region is chosen posthoc manually because the theoretical constants are too
conservative.
In this paper, we use preferential attachment graphs as models of scale-free networks,
and we analytically determine the asymptotics of the expected Betti numbers of their clique
complexes (also known as flag complexes ) at all dimensions. An illustration of the clique
complex of a preferential attachment graph is shown on the left panel of Figure 1. We show
that, under mild assumptions, the expected Betti number at dimension 1 is asymptotically
linear in the number of nodes, and those at higher dimensions are bounded between constant
multiples of sublinear powers of the number of nodes. The precise statements of our main
results, Theorem 3 and Proposition 4, are given at the end of Section 2.
Our results suggest that preferential attachment favors higher-order connectivity. For
each dimension larger than 1, when the preferential attachment effect reaches a critical
threshold, the random simplicial complex undergoes a phase transition, in the sense that the
expected Betti number at that dimension ceases to be bounded, and diverges to infinity as
the number of nodes increases. Therefore, when the preferential attachment effect increases,
more and more topological phenomena become possible; and the topological complexity
at each dimension increases as well. The critical thresholds for the lowest dimensions are
illustrated in Figure 2.
On the right panel of Figure 1, we illustrate the sublinear growth of the average Betti
number at dimension 2 through a simulation. Our theorem and our choice of parameters

6/7 are the critical thresholds for dimensions 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
dictate that the curve for the evolution of the expected Betti number is eventually contained
in a band with slope 2 /9, which is the slope of the shaded region. The evolution of our
estimate of the expected Betti number is plotted as the solid curve, and it is plausible that it
remains inside the shaded region when extrapolated indefinitely. We discuss the simulation
in greater detail in Section 8.
Scale-Free Networks Scale-free networks have been widely studied in the network anal-
ysis community. In [Barab´ asi and Albert, 1999], Barabasi and Albert proposed modeling
scale-free networks with preferential attachment graphs. Since then the model has been
refined and generalized in many different ways [Bollob´ as et al., 2001, Buckley and Osthus,
2004, Holme and Kim, 2002]. Regarding higher-order connectivity of preferential attachment
graphs, their clustering coefficients has been well studied (see, for instance, [Bollob´ as and
Riordan, 2002, Holme and Kim, 2002, Eggemann and Noble, 2011, Ostroumova et al., 2013,
Ostroumova Prokhorenkova, 2017]). In [Garavaglia and Stegehuis, 2019], the growth rate
of the expected number of small motifs in preferential attachment graphs was determined.
In [Bianconi and Rahmede, 2016, Courtney and Bianconi, 2017], some forms of preferential
attachment simplicial complexes, were considered, and power laws for some forms of higher-
dimensional degrees were found. However, little is known about topological invariants of
scale-free simplicial complexes beyond dimension 1 [Oh et al., 2021].
Random Simplicial Complexes In general, the literature on random simplicial com-
plexes has been growing rapidly in recent years. [Kahle et al., 2014, Bobrowski and Krioukov,
2022] Of particular interest to us are random clique complexes, and we review some results
about these complexes below.
Being natural extensions of Erdos-Renyi graphs, Erdos-Renyi clique complexes have been
studied intensively. The Betti numbers of Erdos-Renyi clique complexes were found to be
supported at a critical dimension with high probability in [Kahle, 2009, 2014]. This result
can be seen as a generalization of the classical result on the phase transitions of Erdos-
Renyi graphs [Erd¨ os and R´ enyi, 1959]. Limit theorems for the Betti number at the critical
dimension were established [Kahle and Meckes, 2013]. Multivariate central limit theorems for
certain counts for these complexes were established in [Teˇ cinas et al., 2022]. The fundamental
groups of these complexes were studied in [Costa et al., 2015]. These complexes were shown to
be homotopy equivalent to a simplicial complex of the critical dimension with high probability
in [Malen, 2023]. Persistence homology for Erdos-Renyi clique complexes was considered in
[Ababneh and Kahle, 2022].
3A clique complex of a graph may be regarded as a (radius-1) Rips complex with respect
to the graph metric. Rips complexes are geometric clique complexes where nearby points
are connected. They have gained substantial attention due to their applications in topo-
logical data analysis [Bobrowski and Kahle, 2018]. Limit theorems for the Betti numbers
of random Rips complexes constructed from independent and identically distributed points
were established in [Kahle, 2011, Kahle and Meckes, 2013]. They are generalizations of con-
nectivity results for random geometric graphs in [Penrose, 2003]. The asymptotics of the
expected Betti numbers of the Rips complexes of stationary point processes were established
in [Yogeshwaran and Adler, 2015]. The persistent homology of Rips complexes was studied
in [Bobrowski et al., 2017, Hiraoka et al., 2018], among many other works. Functional limit
theorems for the Euler characteristics of Rips complexes were established in [Thomas and
Owada, 2021b,a, Owada and Wei, 2022].
Comparison with Other Random Simplicial Complexes Our results suggest the
following similarities between preferential attachment clique complexes, Erdos-Renyi clique
complexes [Kahle and Meckes, 2013] and random Rips complexes [Kahle, 2011, Yogeshwaran
and Adler, 2015]:
•the major contribution to the Betti numbers are due to small cycles; and
•the expected Betti numbers have a dominating dimension, which is 1 in this case.
On the other hand, our complexes have two distinctive features.
•Unlike Erdos-Renyi clique complexes, there is a range of dimensions with positive
expected Betti numbers, which grow with the number of nodes.
•Compelled by the preferential attachment mechanism, holes are predominantly repre-
sented by highly inter-connected cycles.
Dominating Cycles and Proof Synopsis We describe these small inter-connected cycles
of dimension 2 in the last bullet point above. The case for higher dimensions is similar. For
each positive integer k, let Γ kbe the graph consisting of 4 vertices forming a square (with
no diagonals) and kother vertices that are each connected to all corners of the square. Γ 3is
shown in Figure 3. At dimension 2, the Betti number of the clique complex of this graph is
k−1, which is one less than the number of distinct (but not disjoint) copies of Γ 1in Γ kwhen
the two graphs are suitably directed, as in Figure 3. Therefore, the contribution of such
subgraphs to the Betti number can be approximated by the number of Γ 1’s in the graph.
When we approximate the Betti number of the whole complex with the number of copies
of Γ 1’s, the error term of the approximation consists of a few parts. First, other subcom-
plexes may also add to the Betti number, like (the clique complexes of) subgraphs with
vertices attached to pentagons rather than squares. However, such subcomplexes are more
complicated, and hence fewer of them arise from the preferential attachment mechanism.
On the other hand, copies of Γ kmay not represent actual holes because they could be
boundaries of something else. (e.g. the boundary of a solid ball is a hollow sphere but
the ball itself is not hollow.) However, again, such “something else” objects are also more
4Figure 3: The graph Γ 3. Edges point towards the horizontal square. Unmarked edges can
be directed arbitrarily.
complicated and fewer of them arise. For technical reasons, we will analyze two types of
boundaries separately.
We justify this description in Section 4 and the proof of Lemma 19. Lemmas 17 and 19
together give the asymptotics of the main term. The error terms are handled by Lemma 20
and another application of Lemma 19.
Proof Techniques Like many other works on random simplicial complexes, we rely on
subgraph counting results and a characterization of minimal cycles. Specifically, we rely on
Garavaglia and Stegehuis’ subgraph counting results in [Garavaglia and Stegehuis, 2019],
and we generalize a result on minimal cycles due to Gal and Kahle [Gal, 2005, Kahle, 2009]
to the setting of relative homology using an exact sequence argument. The use of relative
homology is needed for the lower bound on the expected Betti numbers. More details can
be found in Section 4.
As in [Kahle, 2014], links play a crucial role in our argument to simplify the complicated
connections of our dominating minimal cycles. Unlike in [Kahle, 2014], our approach (Propo-
sition 14) is based on homological algebra. Garland’s spectral approach [Garland, 1973] is
not applicable because we know the Betti numbers do not vanish.
Establishing lower bounds on Betti numbers is often difficult. The strong Morse inequal-
ity (Theorem 1.8 of [Forman, 2002]) is not applicable beyond the dominating dimension,
which is 1, and we are not aware of applicable techniques for our case in the literature.
In [Kahle, 2014], an unfilled hole is constructed to give the lower bound of 1. In [Kahle,
2011, Yogeshwaran and Adler, 2015], the Betti numbers are equal to the counts of certain
subcomplexes in the sparse regime, because distinct cycles are not connected. This is not
applicable in our case because our cycles are interconnected.
We obtain our lower bound by finding some copies of the Γ k’s, and subtracting, from the
counts of these copies, the sum of probabilities that the Γ 1’s in these Γ k’s fail to contribute
to the Betti number. A relative-homology argument relates this sum to another count of
certain subcomplexes, which can estimated with a probabilistic argument.
We remark that our method gives estimates of the expected persistent Betti numbers as
well for the filtration of node arrival (the complex at time tconsists of the first tnodes), but
to keep the exposition simple we do not discuss this point in the present paper.
Paper Outline The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We give basic definitions and
state the main results in Section 2. We first review the background materials in Section 3.
5We begin proving the main theorem, Theorem 3, in Section 4 by presenting a decomposition
result, which justifies our discussion on copies of Γ 1’s above. We complete the proof of
Theorem 3 in Section 5. In Section 6, we handle the boundary cases left out by the theorem
by proving Proposition 4. We present and discuss the simulation results in Section 8, and
we discuss future directions in Section 9.

2 Basic Definitions and Main Results
Our main results concern the expected Betti numbers of preferential attachment clique com-
plexes. We will state them precisely after introducing all relevant terms and notations.
Preferential Attachment Graphs We first define preferential attachment graphs. In-
complete lists of the multitude of variants of such graphs can be found in [Ostroumova Prokhorenkova,
2017] and Chapter 4.3 of [Garavaglia, 2019]. We adopt the affine model in [Garavaglia and
Stegehuis, 2019], since we will rely heavily on the subgraph count results therein.
Definition 1 ((Affine) Preferential Attachment Graphs; Definition 1 of [Garavaglia and
Stegehuis, 2019]) .LetT, m be positive integers with T≥2 and let δ∈(−m,∞). The
preferential attachment graph G(T, δ, m ) is the random directed graph with no self-loops
but possibly with repeated edges that is constructed inductively as follows.
•G(2, δ, m ) is the deterministic graph with two nodes, indexed by 1 and 2, and medges
from node 2 to node 1.
•G(T, δ, m ) is constructed by adding a node, with index T, toG(T−1, δ, m ) and m
edges from node Tto randomly chosen nodes in G(T−1, m, δ ). For 1 ≤v≤T−1,
the probability that node vis chosen is proportional to δplus the degree of node v,
which is updated every time an edge is added.
We will consider the preferential attachment graphs G(T, δ, m ) with δ <0. The more
negative δis, the stronger the preferential attachment effect.
Simplicial Complexes, Homology and Betti Numbers Next, we introduce simplicial
complexes and Betti numbers, which are the ranks ofhomology groups . The precise defini-
tions of these topological concepts are long and technical. We will describe these concepts
somewhat informally and point the reader to the literature for the precise definitions. We
refer the reader to [Giblin, 2010] for an elementary introduction, Chapter 2 of [Hatcher, 2002]
6for a thorough exposition, and [Munkres, 1984] for a rigorous exposition based on simplicial
complexes.
A simplicial complex is a combinatorial object formed by gluing together vertices, edges,
triangles, tetrahedra and higher-dimensional simplices in a principled manner. The precise
definition can be found in Definitions 3.14 and 3.18 of [Giblin, 2010], and Chapters 1.2 and
1.3 of [Munkres, 1984]. A simplicial complex Xis said to be a clique complex if it contains
a simplex whenever it contains all edges of the simplex. For example, the filled triangle is
a clique complex, while the hollow triangle is not. The clique complex of a simple graph is
the simplicial complex formed by adding a simplex to the graph whenever all edges of the
simplex are in the graph.
The homology group Hq(X) of a simplicial complex Xat dimension qis an abelian
group that consists of equivalence classes of q-dimensional cycles . Two cycles that differ by
theboundary of a formal sum of ( q+ 1)-dimensional simplices are considered equivalent.
These equivalence classes, called homology classes , are formal sums of q-dimensional “holes”
in the simplicial complex, with the exception that H0(X) consists of formal sums of path
components. For example, for the n-dimensional sphere Snand the n-dimensional solid ball
Dn(suitably triangulated),
Hq(Sn) =(
Zifq∈ {0, n}
0 otherwise;Hq(Dn) =(
Zifn= 0
0 otherwise.(1)
The equivalence relation of cycles weeds out cycles that witness “fake” holes. For example,
the boundary sphere of a solid ball is a cycle, but it does not really represent a hole in
the solid ball. The precise definition of homology groups can be found in Definition 4.8 of
[Giblin, 2010], Chapter 1.5 of [Munkres, 1984] and the section titled “Simplicial Homology”
in Chapter 2.1 of [Hatcher, 2002].
The Betti number βq(X) of a simplicial complex Xat dimension qis the rank of Hq(X).
In symbols, βq(X) = rk Hq(X). The rank of a group is the size of a maximal linearly
independent subset. If the group is a vector space, then the rank is the dimension. Roughly
speaking, the Betti numbers are the numbers of components and holes in X. For instance,
βq(Sn) =(
1 if q∈ {0, n}
0 otherwise.
The precise definition of Betti numbers can be found on p.155 of [Giblin, 2010], p.24 of
[Munkres, 1984] and p.130 of [Hatcher, 2002].
Main Results We now state our main results. We adopt the asymptotical notations in
Table 1, where fandgare assumed to be nonnegative functions defined on N. Following
the notation in [Garavaglia and Stegehuis, 2019], let
χ(δ, m) = 1−1
2 +δ/m∈(0,1/2). (2)
When δbecomes more negative, χdecreases, and hence χdecreases with strength of the
preferential attachment effect. It is important not to confuse χwith the Euler characteristic,
which is also commonly denoted by χ.
7We define the preferential attachment clique complex X(T, δ, m ) as follows.
Definition 2 (Preferential Attachment Clique Complex) .LetG(T, δ, m ) be the preferential
attachment graph, and Gsimple(T, δ, m ) be the graph obtained by replacing all repeated edges
inG(T, δ, m ) with simple edges. The preferential attachment clique complex X(T, δ, m ) is
the clique complex of Gsimple(T, δ, m ).
Our main result is as follows.
Theorem 3. LetX(T, δ, m ) be the preferential attachment clique complex. Let q≥2 and
suppose m≥2q. Then
E(βq(X(T, δ, m )) =

Θ(T1−2qχ(δ,m)) if 1 −2qχ(δ, m)>0
Θ(log T) if 1 −2qχ(δ, m) = 0
O(1) otherwise,
where the big-Oh and big-Θ constants (see Table 1) depend only on q, δ, m , and Edenotes
expectation.
One could keep track of the big-Θ constants in the proof. For instance, when m= 7, δ=
−5, q= 2, the big-Θ constants can be chosen to be C= 2.16×1014andc= 1.18×10−34.
Finding the optimal constants, however, is beyond the scope of this work.
The theorem leaves out the trivial cases for q <2 orm < 2q, which we address below.
Proposition 4. LetX(T, δ, m ) be the preferential attachment clique complex. Then
•Forq= 0,β0(X(T, δ, m ))≡1.
•Forq= 1,E[β1(X(T, δ, m ))] = ( m−1)T+o(T)
•Form < 2q,βq(X(T, δ, m ))≡0.
Remark. A notion of clique complex for multigraphs is defined in [Ayzenberg and Rukhovich,
2020]. This complex is not a simplicial complex but it is a regular CW complex. Simplices
in this complex are fully connected subsets with labelled edges. We do not use this notion
to keep the exposition simple; this notion also presents challenges to numerical simulations.
We remark that our argument gives the same bound for this notion of clique complex upon
slight modifications, because most edges in preferential attachment graphs are simple, and
repeated edges only change expected subgraph counts by at most a constant factor.

3 Preliminaries
We recall relevant results in the literature in this section. First, we recall subgraph counting
results in Section 3.1. Then, in Section 3.2, we recall facts from homological algebra that
helps us manipulate homology groups. We define a few simplicial complexes and subcom-
plexes that will be featured in our proof in Section 3.3. Finally, we conclude this section by
stating our generalization of Gal and Kahle’s result on minimal clique cycles in Section 3.4.
We defer its homological-algebraic proof to Section 7.
3.1 Preferential Attachment Graphs
Recall that preferential attachment graphs are defined in Definition 1, and we need certain
subgraph count results, namely Theorem 7 and Proposition 8. We develop a few definitions
to simplify their statements.
The preferential attachment graph G(T, δ, m ) is a random subgraph of the underlying
attachment graph U(T, m), which we define as follows.
Definition 5 (Attachment Graph) .The ( T, m)-attachment graph U(T, m) is the directed
multigraph such that
•the vertex set is {1, ..., T},
•there are medges between any pair of distinct nodes, and
•all edges point from later nodes to earlier nodes.
The following definition will simplify the expression of the estimate in the theorem.
Definition 6 (Degree and Power) .Let Γ be a subgraph of U(T, m) and vbe a vertex in
Γ. Denote by din
Γ(v) and dout
Γ(v) the in- and out-degrees of vwith respect to Γ. The power

,
where χ(δ, m) is defined in (2).
9Theorem 7 (Theorem 1 of [Garavaglia and Stegehuis, 2019]) .Consider the preferential
attachment graph G(T, δ, m ). Let Γ be a subgraph of U(T, m) with vertex set VΓ={v1<
... < v |VΓ|}and with out-degrees bounded above by m. Then the expected count of subgraphs
inG(T, δ, m ) that are isomorphic to Γ is
Θ(TA(logT)r−1),
where Ais the maximum value of the sequence a0, ..., a |VΓ|defined by
ak=|VΓ| −k+X
l>kpΓ(vl), (3)
andris the number of maximizers. The big-Θ constants are independent of Tbut do depend
onm,δand the in- and out-degree sequences of Γ.
Remark. The original theorem is stated in terms of τ= 3 + δ/m (see the end of Section 2.1
of [Garavaglia and Stegehuis, 2019]) rather than δ, morχ(δ, m) . We do not use τbecause
nowhere is τused in the proof and using τdoes not simplify our expressions.
Theorem 7 can be proven from the following lemma, which we will need for the lower
bound of the expected Betti numbers.
Proposition 8 (Lemma 1 of [Garavaglia and Stegehuis, 2019]) .Let Γ be a subgraph of
U(T, m) with vertex set VΓ⊆ {1, ..., T}and with out-degrees bounded above by m. Then
the probability that G(T, δ, m ) contains Γ is
Θ Y
v∈VΓvpΓ(v)!
,
where the big-Θ constants depend only on δ,m, and the in-degree sequence of Γ.
3.2 Homological Algebra
The technical definition of homology offers a host of homological-algebraic tools for deducing
relationships between homology groups of different simplicial complexes, which are encoded
by homomorphisms induced by maps between the complexes. The most important tool is
called exact sequences , which are generalizations of the rank-nullity theorem. Specifically,
we will need the long exact sequence for triplets , and the Mayer-Vietoris sequence . We state
them at the end of this section.
Every map f:X→Ybetween two simplicial complexes induces a homomorphism
fq:Hq(X)→Hq(Y) at every dimension q. This homomorphism maps a cycle in Xto the
image of the cycle under f. Interesting relationships between the homology of a complex Y
and a subcomplex X⊆Yare often revealed by the homomorphism induced by the inclusion
map f:X→Y(defined by f(x) =x).
An exact sequence is a sequence of groups ( An) with homomorphisms φn:An→An+1
between adjacent groups, such that ker φn= im φn−1. The sequence is said to be short if it
starts and ends with the trivial group 0. We will use the following fact repeatedly.
10Proposition 9 (Alternating Sum of Ranks of a Short Exact Sequence; Exercise 3.16 of
[Rotman, 2008]) .Let 0 →A1→...→An→0 be a short exact sequence of finitely
generated abelian groups. Then
X
i(−1)krkAk= 0,and
rkAk≤rkAk−1+ rkAk+1for every 1 < k < n.
The rank-nullity theorem is a special case of the first fact for n= 3.
Proof. The first claim is Exercise 3.16 of [Rotman, 2008]. For the second claim, note that
the following sequence is also exact:
0→imφk−1i− →Akφk− →imφk→0,
where idenotes the inclusion homomorphism. The first claim in the proposition implies
rkAk= rk im φk−1+ rk im φk≤rkAk−1+ rkAk+1.
To state the long exact sequence for triplets, we need to define pairs andtriplets of
simplicial complexes. A 2-tuple ( X, A) of simplicial complexes is said to be a pair if Ais
a subcomplex of X, and a 3-tuple ( Y, X, A ) is said to be a triplet if ( Y, X) and ( X, A) are
two pairs. A simplicial complex Xcan be identified with the pair ( X,∅). The homology
group Hq(X, A) of a pair ( X, A) at dimension qis called the relative homology group ofX
at dimension qrelative to A. Its rank is called the (relative) Betti number of the pair and is
denoted by βq(X, A).
In homology theory, pairs play the role that quotient vector spaces play in linear algebra.
(X, A) acts like the “quotient” of XbyA, and ( Y, X) acts like the “quotient” of ( Y, A) by
(X, A). Precisely, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 10 (Long Exact Sequence for Triplets; Theorem 7.8 of [Giblin, 2010], Exercise
24.1 of [Munkres, 1984], p.118 of [Hatcher, 2002]) .For every triplet ( Y, X, A ), there exists a
homomorphism ∂q:Hq(Y, X)→Hq−1(X, A) for each qsuch that following sequence is exact
...→Hq(X, A)→Hq(Y, A)→Hq(Y, X)∂q− →Hq−1(X, A)→Hq−1(Y, A)→...,
where all unmarked maps are induced by inclusions.
The Mayer-Vietoris sequence is useful for divide-and-conquer arguments, as it relates the
homology groups of a space with those of its subspaces.
Proposition 11 (Mayer-Vietoris Sequence; Theorem 7.2 of [Giblin, 2010]; Theorem 25.1 of
[Munkres, 1984], p.149 of [Hatcher, 2002]) .LetXandYbe subcomplexes of a simplicial
complex Z. Then there exist maps such that the following sequence is exact.
...→Hq(X∩Y)→Hq(X)⊕Hq(Y)→Hq(X∪Y)→Hq−1(X∩Y)→...
Finally, for those who are concerned about the coefficient groups for homology, we prove
our result with coefficients in Z. The same argument works for arbitrary field coefficients.
Homological computations of our numerical simulations are done with coefficients in Z/2Z.

3.3 Examples of Simplicial Complexes and Subcomplexes
In this section, we define a few simplicial complexes and subcomplexes that will appear in
the proof.
We denote by
•Sqthe octahedral q-sphere, which has 2( q+ 1) vertices and can be embedded in Rq+1
by mapping the vertices to unit vectors on coordinate axes, and
•Dq+1the octahedral ( q+ 1)-ball, which is constructed by adding a vertex to Sqand
connecting the new vertex with all vertices in Sq. It can be embedded in Rq+1by
mapping the new vertex to the origin.
For instance, S1andD2, illustrated in Figure 4, are the unfilled and filled squares. S2and
D3are illustrated in Figure 5. We sometimes abuse notations and denote their underlying
graphs by these symbols. Their homology groups are given in Section 2.
We also need the notion of link. Let Xbe a simplicial complex.
•The star of a vertex vinX, denoted by St X(v), is the subcomplex of Xconsisting
of all simplices containing v(and the faces of these simplices). (Our notion of star is
called the closed star in Definition 3.24 of [Giblin, 2010] and p.11 of [Munkres, 1984].)
12•Thelinkof a vertex vinX, denoted by Lk X(v), is the subcomplex of St X(v) consisting
of all simplices that does notcontain v. (Cf. Definition 3.28 of [Giblin, 2010] and p.11
of [Munkres, 1984].)
For instance, the link of the central vertex in D2isS1.
The star of a vertex has the same Betti numbers as Dq+1, which are stated in Section 2,
because they are both contractible .
3.4 Minimal Clique Cycles
In this section, we state a result, namely Proposition 13, about minimal cycles in clique
complexes, which will be needed to characterize the Γ k’s in the Introduction as the dominat-
ing cycles. It is a slight generalization of Lemmas 5.2 and 5.3 in [Kahle, 2009] and Lemma
2.1.4 in [Gal, 2005] to the context of relative homology. Its proof, which is based on an
exact-sequence argument, is deferred to Section 7.
Definition 12 (Clique-Minimal Complex) .LetXbe a clique complex and Abe a subcom-
plex. For q≥0,Xis said to be ( A, q)-clique-minimal if for every clique subcomplex YofX
that contains A,
βq(Y, A)>0 if and only if X=Y.
IfAis the empty set, we abbreviate ( A, q)-clique-minimality as q-clique-minimality.
Proposition 13. Letq≥0 and Abe an induced subcomplex of a clique complex X(i.e.
Acontains a simplex σofXwhenever Acontains all vertices of σ). Suppose Xis (A, q)-
clique-minimal. Then
•ifAis just a vertex, then Xhas at least 2 q+ 2 vertices; otherwise, Xhas at least one
more vertex than Adoes; and
•degv≥2qfor every vertex vinXnot in A, where deg denotes the degree of a vertex
in the underlying graph of X.
Remark. Note that a clique-minimal complex is not necessarily minimal (defined by dropping
all instances of “clique” in the definition above). For example, let Abe a triangulated annulus
whose inner boundary has three edges. Consider the double cover TofA, which is formed by
gluing together two identical copies of Aalong the boundaries. Let T′be the space formed
by gluing a triangle to the inner boundary of AinT. Then Tis 2-minimal but not 2-clique
minimal. T′is not 2-minimal, but it is 2-clique minimal, if the triangulation of Ais nice
enough.
4 A Decomposition Result
In this section, we begin our proof of Theorem 3 by establishing a decomposition result,
Proposition 14, which estimates the Betti numbers of the whole complex in terms of the
Betti numbers of its links. After stating the proposition, we describe its relationship with
13the discussion on dominating cycles in the Introduction. We conclude the section by proving
the proposition.
LetXbe a clique complex with vertices {1, ..., T}.
•LetX(t)be the subcomplex of Xsuch that X(t)consists of all simplices of Xwhose
vertices are all in {1, ..., t}.
•LetL(t)be the link of tinX(t), and f(t):L(t)→X(t−1)be the inclusion map ( L(t)⊆
X(t−1)because titself does not lie in its link).
•For a subcomplex SofX, a nonnegative integer q, nodes s, tofXsuch that all indices
of nodes in Sare smaller than s, and s < t , letS(S, q, s, t ) be the event where
–Sis isomorphic to Sq−1, and
–S⊆L(s)∩L(t).
Recall that Sq−1is the sphere in Section 3.3. Note that when S(S, q, s, t ) happens, X
contains a q-dimensional sphere with Sas the equator and sandtas the poles.
We need the following terms for our estimate.
ℓ(t)(S, s) =1[S(S, q, s, t )]
b(t)
IK(S, s) =1[S(S, q, s, t )]1[βq(L(t), S)>0]
b(t)
KL=βq(L(t))
u(t)=βq−1(L(t)),
where 1[Λ] denotes the indicator of the event Λ, and f(t)
q−1is the homomorphism between
homology groups at dimension q−1 induced by the map f(t). Technically these terms should
be subscripted by q, but we drop it since we will not change the dimension q.
The letters uandℓstand for upper and lower bounds, and bstands for boundary. The
subscripts IKandKLdenote the two types of boundaries mentioned in the Introduction,
and we will explain them below. Note that despite their notational difference, u(t)andb(t)
KL
are just Betti numbers of L(t)of different dimensions. They will be estimated in the same
way in Lemma 19.
We now state our decomposition result.
Proposition 14. LetXbe a clique complex. Let q≥2,Sbe a subcomplex of X, and sbe
a node whose label is larger than all node labels in S. Then

Figure 6: Illustration for the underlying graph of X(6)in Example 16.
The most important statement is the last bullet point. The first bullet point is merely a
stepping stone to it. The second bullet point, while also a stepping stone, will also be used
in our discussion on simulation results.
Returning to the discussion of Γ k’s in the Introduction, one may check that u(t)= 1 on
the event where L(t)is a square or a pentagon. In the former case the square along with
vertex tgives a copy of Γ 1. We will show that the count of squares is the dominating term
foru(t)in expectation at the end of the proof of Lemma 19. Similarly, ℓ(t)counts a subset
of copies of Γ 1’s in the complex.
KLstands for “KilL”, as a cycle is killed in the homology group when a boundary is
formed. We give an example where b(t)
KL= 1.
Example 15 (Kill).Letq= 2 and t= 7. Let X(6)∼=S2, and X(7)be the clique complex
with vertex 7 connected to 1 ,2,3,4,5,6. The underlying graph of X(7)is shown on the right
panel of Figure 5. Then X(7)∼=D3. The Betti number at dimension 2 drops by 1 when the
new simplices are added.
IKstands for “Instant Kill”, as the defining event happens when a new cycle is killed
soon as it forms. We give an example where b(t)
IK= 1.
Example 16 (Instant Kill) .Letq= 2 and t= 6. Let X(5)∼=D2with vertices 1 ,2,3,4
on the boundary and vertex 5 in the center. Let S=X(4). Let X(6), which is illustrated
in Figure 6, be the clique complex with vertex 6 connected to 1 ,2,3,4,5. The addition of
new simplices creates a 2-cycle, namely the sum of the two copies of (the clique complex of)
Γ1spanned by 1 ,2,3,4,5 and 1 ,2,3,4,6. However, this does not add to the Betti number,
since the new cycle is also the boundary of the sum of all tetrahedra in X(6). One may
check that indeed b(6)
IK(X(4),5) = 1, as the exact sequence of the pair ( L(6), X(4)) shows
H2(L(6), X(4))∼=H1(X(4))∼=Z.
We now prove Proposition 14.
Proof of Proposition 14. It suffices to show the first two claims. The last claim is a straight-
forward corollary.
For the first claim, let Cbe the star of tinX(t). Then Cis contractible. Consider the
Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the decomposition X(t)=X(t−1)∪C:
Hq(L(t))f(t)
q− − →Hq(X(t−1))→Hq(X(t))→Hq−1(L(t))f(t)
q−1− − → Hq−1(X(t−1)),
15where the trivial summands H∗(C)∼=0 are suppressed. Hence we have the short exact
sequence
0→imf(t)
q→Hq(X(t−1))→Hq(X(t))→kerf(t)
q−1→0.
Since the alternating sum of ranks vanishes, we have
rkHq(X(t))−rkHq(X(t−1)) = rk ker f(t)
q−1−rk im f(t)
q,
where rk ker f(t)
q−1≤rkHq−1(L(t)) =βq−1(L(t)) because the latter group contains the for-
mer, and rk im f(t)
q≤βq(L(t)) by the rank-nullity theorem. The first claim then follows by
summing over t.
For the second claim, consider the following commutative diagram.
...→Hq(L(t), S) Hq−1(S) Hq−1(L(t))
Hq−1(StX(t−1)(s)) Hq−1(X(t−1)).∂ jq−1
0 f(t)
q−1
The maps in the rectangle are all induced by inclusion. The top row comes from the
exact sequence for the pair ( L(t), S). The left vertical map is 0 because StX(t−1)(s) is acyclic
(Theorem 6.8 of [Giblin, 2010], Theorem 8.2 of [Munkres, 1984]).
Commutativity of the rectangle then implies im jq−1lies in ker f(t)
q−1, and hence
rk ker f(t)
q−1≥rk im jq−1= 1−rk ker jq−1= 1,
where the first equality follows from rank-nullity theorem (recall βq−1(S) = 1), and the
second one holds by assumption. The second bullet point then follows.
For the last claim, exactness of the top row at Hq−1(S) gives
rk ker jq−1= rk im ∂≤rkHq(L(t), S). (4)
Hence,
rk ker f(t)
q−1≥rk ker f(t)
q−11[S(S, q, s, t )]1[rk ker jq−1= 0]
≥1[S(S, q, s, t )]1[rk ker jq−1= 0] (by second claim)
=1[S(S, q, s, t )](1−1[rk ker jq−1>0])
≥1[S(S, q, s, t )](1−1[βq(L(t), S)>0]) (by (4)) .
The last claim then follows from applying the first claim and plugging in definitions.
5 Proof of Theorem 3
It remains to estimate the expectations of all the terms in Proposition 14 for the preferential
attachment complex for some choice of Sands. Throughout our proof, we fix S=X(2q)
ands= 2q+ 1.
A direct application of Proposition 8 gives a lower bound onPE[ℓ(t)(X(2q),2q+ 1)].
16Lemma 17. Consider the preferential attachment complex X=X(T, δ, m ). Let q≥0 and
suppose m≥2q. Then
X
t≤TE[ℓ(t)(X(2q),2q+ 1)] =(
Ω(T1−2qχ(δ,m)) if 1 −2qχ(δ, m)>0
Ω(log T) if 1 −2qχ(δ, m) = 0
where the big-Ω constants depend only on q, δ, m .
Proof. For each t >2q+ 1, let Γ(t)be a subgraph of U(t, m) (possibly with repeated edges)
with the following properties:
•the vertices are 1, ..., 2 q+ 1 and t;
•each of tand 2 q+ 1 is connected to each of 1, ..., 2 q, and tis not connected to 2 q+ 1;
•all edges incident on tare simple;
•the out-degree of every vertex other than 1 and tism; and
•removing tand edges incident on tand replacing repeated edges with simple edges
gives the underlying graph of Dq.
For example, for q= 2, Γ(t), can be the graph illustrated on the left panel of Figure 5, which
by definition has the following edges:
•medges between 1 and 2 and medges between 1 and 3,
•m−1 edges between 4 and 2 and 1 edge between 4 and 3,
•m−3 edges between 5 and 1 and 1 edge between 5 and each of 2 ,3,4, and
•1 edge between tand each of 1 ,2,3,4.
The Γ(t)’s can be chosen to be isomorphic to each other. Then S(X(2q), q,2q+ 1, t) holds
forX(T, δ, m ) whenever X(T, δ, m ) contains Γ(t).
To simplify notations, let p(v) =pΓ(t)(v) for every vertex vof Γ(t). Note that p(t) =
−2qχ(δ, m).By Proposition 8, we have
P[S(X(2q), q,2q+ 1, t)] = Ω( tp(t)Y
k≤2q+1kp(k)) = Ω( tp(t)) = Ω( t−2qχ(δ,m)).
Summing over tand applying integral test gives the desired result.
Next we use Theorem 7 and Proposition 13 to estimatePE[u(t)],PE[b(t)
KL] andPE[b(t)
IK(X(2q),2q+ 1)],
but before that, we need an auxiliary lemma to simplify the application of Theorem 7.
Lemma 18. Let Γ be a subgraph of U(T, m) with vertex set VΓ={v1< ... < v |VH|}. Let dk
anddin
kbe the total degree (sum of in- and out-degrees) and the in-degree of node vkwith
respect to Γ. Then the sequence ( ak) in Theorem 7 satisfies
ak−ak−1(
=dkχ(δ, m)−1 if din
k= 0
≥(dk−2)χ(δ, m) if din
k>0.
17Proof. Direct verification.
The next lemma gives a matching upper bound onPE[u(t)] and an upper bound onPE[b(t)
DR] with a smaller order of magnitude.
Lemma 19. Consider the preferential attachment complex X=X(T, δ, m ). Let q≥1 and
suppose m≥2(q+ 1). Then
X
t≤TE[βq(L(t))] =

O(T1−2(q+1)χ(δ,m)) if 1 −2(q+ 1)χ(δ, m)>0
O(logT) if 1 −2(q+ 1)χ(δ, m) = 0
O(1) otherwise,
where the big-Oh constants depend only on q, δ, m .
Proof. Since L(t)has at most mvertices, it has at most m
q+1
q-dimensional simplices, where m
q+1
denotes the binomial coefficient. By the weak Morse inequality (Theorem 1.7 of [For-
man, 2002]),
βq(L(t))≤m
q+ 1
1[βq(L(t))>0], (5)
and hence thePβq(L(t)) is at most m
q+1
times the number of t’s such that βq(L(t))>0. We
will construct a distinct graph Γ(t)for each such t, and bound the expected count of such
graphs.
Whenever βq(L(t))>0,L(t)contains a q-clique-minimal subcomplex (note that L(t)is
also clique, see Lemma 21), which by Proposition 13, has at least 2 q+ 2 vertices, whose
degrees are at least 2 q. Since these vertices are all connected to node tinG(T, δ, m ), this
gives rise to a subgraph Γ(t)inG(T, δ, m ) with the following properties:
•Γ(t)has at least 2 q+ 3 vertices, and at most m+ 1 vertices,
•the vertices of Γ(t)all have degrees at least 2 q+ 1, and
•the last vertex of Γ(t)(which is t) is connected to all other vertices.
Note that for t̸=s, Γ(t)and Γ(s)are distinct subgraphs in G(T, δ, m ) because their last
nodes are different.
Therefore, (5) impliesPE[βq(L(t))] is at most m
q+1
times the expected number of sub-
graphs of G(T, δ, m ) satisfying the properties above.
We use Theorem 7 to give an upper bound on the expected count of all such subgraphs.
Since such subgraphs have at most m+ 1 vertices, there are only finitely many isomorphism
classes of such graphs. Fix an isomorphism class and pick a representative Γ in the class.
We claim the sequence ( ak) in (3) attains its maximum at |VΓ| −1 or|VΓ|. To establish
this claim, it suffices to show a0< a 1< ... < a |VΓ|−1. Let 0 < k < |VΓ|. Then vkis not the
last vertex of Γ. Since its degree is at least 2 q+ 1≥3, and since it is connected to the last
vertex, Lemma 18 implies that
ak−ak−1≥(3−2)χ(δ, m)>0.
18The claim then follows.
By definition, a|VΓ|= 0. Hence, by Lemma 18 again,
a|VΓ|−1=−(a|VΓ|−a|VΓ|−1) = 1−dΓχ(δ, m),
where dΓis the degree of the last node with respect to Γ. Therefore, the expected count of
Γ is
O(TAΓlogrΓT),
where
AΓ= max (0 ,1−dΓχ(δ, m))
rΓ=1[1−dΓχ(δ, m) = 0] .
The sum of counts for all isomorphism classes is dominated by the classes of the Γ’s with the
minimum dΓ. Our criteria for Γ require dΓ≥2q+ 2. The result then follows. Note that the
minimal dΓis attained by Dq+1, which is the only minimizer such that the corresponding
βq(L(t)) is positive, and this justifies our discussion of Γ 1’s in the introduction.
A similar argument using relative homology gives an upper bound onP
t≤TE[b(t)
IK(X(2q),2q+ 1)]
with a smaller order of magnitude.
Lemma 20. Suppose q≥2 and m≥2q. Let Sbe a (possibly random) subcomplex Sof
X(T, δ, m ), and sbe a (possibly random) node in X(T, δ, m ) that is (almost surely) a later
node than all nodes in S. Then
X
t≤TE[b(t)
IK(S, s)] =

O(T1−(2q+1)χ(δ,m)) if 1 −(2q+ 1)χ(δ, m)>0
O(logT) if 1 −(2q+ 1)χ(δ, m) = 0
O(1) otherwise,
where the big-Oh constants depend only on q, δ, m .
Proof. Again, on the event βq(L(t), X(2q))>0,L(t)contains an ( S, q)-clique-minimal sub-
complex, which by Proposition 13, has at least 2 q+ 1 vertices, 2 qof them (from S) with
degree at least (2 q−2), and the rest with degree at least 2 q.
Since these vertices are all connected to node tinG(T, δ, m ), this gives rise to a subgraph
Γ(t)inG(T, δ, m ) with the following properties:
•Γ(t)has at least 2 q+ 2 vertices, and at most m+ 1 vertices;
•2qvertices of Γ have degrees at least 2 q−1, and the rest have degrees at least 2 q+ 1;
and
•the last vertex of Γ(t)(which is t) is connected to all other vertices.
Then E[b(t)
IK(S, s)] is at most the expected number of such subgraphs.
Appealing to Theorem 7 again, for each such Γ, the maximum AΓof the sequence ( ak)
is attained by one of the last two terms. The result then follows.
The proof of Theorem 3 is now complete by plugging in estimates in Lemmas 17, 19
and 20 to Proposition 14.
196 Proof of Proposition 4
The claim for q= 0 is trivial, because preferential attachment graphs are connected by
construction. The claim for m < 2qfollows from the fact that there are not enough edges
to form q-dimensional holes. This can be seen by applying Proposition 13 to the last node
in a hypothetical q-minimal subcomplex.
It remains to prove the case for q= 1 with Morse inequality. Let |¯V|,|¯E|,|¯F|be the
expected numbers of vertices, edges and triangles in X(T, δ, m ). The strong Morse inequality
(Theorem 1.8 of [Forman, 2002]) implies that
|¯E| − |¯V| − |¯F| ≤Eβ1(X(T, δ, m ))≤Eβ0(X(T, δ, m )) +|¯E| − |¯V|.
Obviously, |¯V|=Tandβ0(X(T, δ, m )) = 1. Theorem 7 implies the expected numbers of
triangles and of bi-angles (the two-node graph with two distinct edges from one node to the
other) are both o(T), and hence
m(T−1)−2o(T)≤ |¯E| ≤m(T−1)
|¯F|=o(T).
The result then follows.
7 Proof of Proposition 13
Our proof follows the argument of Lemmas 5.2 and 5.3 in [Kahle, 2009]. We generalize
these lemmas to the setting of relative homology in Lemma 22. To ensure clique-minimality
conditions are met in our argument, we need Lemma 21 to ensure certain subcomplexes of
a clique complex are clique complexes. Proposition 13 is a corollary of Lemma 22.
For every simplicial complex Xand every vertex vofX, we denote by X−vthe simplicial
complex that consists precisely of simplices that do not contain v.
Lemma 21. IfXis a clique complex, then Lk XvandX−vare clique complexes for every
vertex vinX.
Proof. The claim for X−vis trivial. For Lk Xv, letw0, ..., w qbe distinct vertices in Lk Xv
andσbe the simplex whose vertex set is {w0, ..., w q}. Since each wilies in the link, it is a
vertex of a simplex in St Xv, and hence Xcontains the edge from vto the wias well. Since
this is true for all wi’s,Xcontains the simplex σvwhose vertex set is {w0, ..., w q} ∪ {v}. By
definition σvlies in the star, and hence σdoes too. Since σdoes not contain v,σlies in the
link.
Next, we generalize Lemmas 5.2 and 5.3 of [Kahle, 2009] to the setting of relative homol-
ogy. Only the first part of following lemma is novel. The second claim is Lemma 2.1.4 of
[Gal, 2005] and Lemma 5.3 of [Kahle, 2009] phrased differently. We reproduce their proofs
with our terminologies.
Lemma 22. LetXbe a clique complex and Abe a (not necessarily clique) subcomplex of
X. Suppose Xis (A, q)-clique-minimal. Then following statements are true.
201. If q >0 then,
βq−1(LkX(v), B)>0
for every vertex vinXbut not in Aand every (possibly empty) acyclic subcomplex
Bof Lk X(v)∩A. (Acyclic means H0isZor 0 and all other homology groups are 0.)
2. If q≥0 and Aconsists of one single vertex, then Xhas at least 2 q+ 2 vertices.
Proof. For the first claim, fix a vertex vinXbut not in A. We have the following commu-
tative diagram.
Hq(LkXv, B) Hq(StXv, B) Hq(StXv,LkXv) Hq−1(LkXv, B)
Hq(X−v, A) Hq(X, A) Hq(X, X−v) Hq−1(X−v, A),0 ψ
φ;EX
rk 0
where the two rows are long exact sequences of triplets, and the vertical maps are induced
by inclusion. We would like to show the top-right group has positive rank.
We explain the annotations in the diagram. The map φ, marked by “EX”, is an iso-
morphism by excision theorem (Theorem 6.4 of [Giblin, 2010], Theorem 9.1 of [Munkres,
1984] and Theorem 2.20 of [Hatcher, 2002]). The map marked by “0” is zero because St Xv
is contractible (and q≥1), and map marked by “rk 0” is rank-0 by the clique-minimality of
X. Exactness then implies ψis injective and βq(X, X−v)≥βq(X, A)>0, where the last
inequality holds by assumption.
Since the top-right group contains ψφ−1Hq(X, X−v), it must have positive rank. The
first claim then follows.
For the second claim, the case for q= 0 is trivial. For q >0, suppose for contradiction
thatXhas strictly fewer than 2 q+ 2 vertices.
We first consider the main case when there is a vertex vconnected to the vertex in A.
The first claim implies βq−1(LkX(v), A)>0. Therefore, Lk X(v) has an ( A, q−1)-clique-
minimal subcomplex, and hence by induction, the link has at least 2 qnodes. Since we have
assumed Xhas strictly fewer than 2 q+ 2 vertices, all nodes other than vare in the link.
In other words, Xis St X(v), and hence is contractible, contradictory to the assumption of
(A, q)-clique minimality. [Removed redundant paragraph.]
We now consider the case when Ais not connected to any other vertices. Since βq(X, A)>
0,X−Ahas at least one edge, say with endpoints v, winX−A. It can be directly verified
thatX−Aisq-minimal, and hence ( {w}, q)-minimal. The main case above implies X−A
has at least 2 q+ 2 vertices, and hence Xdoes too.
Proof of Proposition 13. The first part of the first claim is just the second claim of Lemma 22.
The second part of the first claim is trivial, because if Xhas the same vertex set as A, then
X=A(because Ais an induced subcomplex), and hence Hq(X, A) = 0.
The second claim is trivial for q= 0. For q >0, since the removal of isolated vertices
not in Adoes not change the (relative) Betti number at dimension q, clique-minimality
implies deg v≥1, and hence Lk X(v) is nonempty. The first claim in Lemma 22 implies
βq−1(LkX(v),∅)>0, and hence βq−1(LkX(v),{w})>0 whenever w∈LkX(v). The second
claim then implies Lk X(v) contains a subcomplex with at least 2 qvertices. This means that
vis connected to at least 2 qvertices in X.
218 Numerical Simulation
We discuss the simulation we mentioned in the Introduction in greater detail. Recall the
right panel of Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of the mean Betti numbers. Below, we explain
the setup of the simulation, and we return to discuss the results shown in Figure 1 at the
last paragraph.
Numerical computations related to topology and graph theory are done with Ripser
[Bauer, 2021, Tralie et al., 2018] and Igraph [Csardi and Nepusz, 2006] respectively. Other
numerical computations are done with Numpy [Harris et al., 2020] and Scipy [Virtanen
et al., 2020]. Codes are compiled with Numba [Lam et al., 2015]. Plots are generated with
Matplotlib [Hunter, 2007].
500 preferential attachment clique complexes with T= 104nodes and with parameters
m= 7 and δ=−5 are generated. We compute the sample mean of their Betti numbers
(with coefficients in Z/2Z) at dimension q= 2.
The black curve corresponds to the evolution of mean Betti numbers. We remark that
the median of means gives a similar estimate of the expectation.
We also compute the sample mean of the upper boundPu(t)in Proposition 14 and the
sample mean of a lower boundP
s<t≤T(ℓ(t)(S, s)−ˆb(t)
IK(S, s))−P
t≤Tb(t)
KL, where S,sand
ˆb(t)
IK(S, s) will be defined below. The evolution of the means of these bounds are plotted in
dotted lines. We compute these quantities for graphs with T= 105nodes, because their
computation is cheaper than that of Betti numbers.
We now defined S,sandˆbIK(S, s).
•Sis the first induced subcomplex of X(20)(in an arbitrary but deterministically con-
sistent ordering) that is isomorphic to Sq−1, if one exists; otherwise, it is the first
subcomplex of X(20);
•sis the first node whose label is larger than all of those in Ssuch that S⊆LkX(s), if
it exists; otherwise it is node 21;
•ˆb(t)
IK(S, s) =1[S(S, q, s, t )]1[rk ker jq−1= 1], where j:S→L(t)denotes the inclusion
map.
We remark on these definitions:
•The “otherwise” statements in the above definition are unimportant, because in those
cases, ℓ(t)(S, s) =ˆb(t)
IK(S, s) = 0.
•We do not fix S=X(2q)ands= 2q+ 1 as in our proofs, because S(X(2q), q,2q+ 1, t)
happens too rarely that E[Pℓ(t)] is too small to be numerically estimated.
•We change the definition of ˆb(t)
IKbecause the computation of relative Betti numbers
is numerically inconvenient. We numerically compute rk ker jq−1by computing the
persistence diagram for the inclusion S(t)⊆L(t)with Ripser [Bauer, 2021, Tralie et al.,
2018]. By the first two bullet points of Proposition 14, the new expression does give a
lower bound.
22Finally, we draw a band that contains all curves. The slope of the band is determined
by Theorem 3. While the discussion beneath the theorem suggests some values of the y-
intercepts for the band, the corresponding band trivially covers the entire plot. Instead, we
manually choose other values of the y-intercepts.
It is apparent from the plot that the convergence is slow. In particular, at T= 105,
the mean upper bound still grows at a rate faster than the asymptotic rate. However, it is
obvous that the curve is concave, and hence has a decreasing slope. We also note that the
mean upper bound is a good approximation of the mean Betti numbers.
9 Future Directions
We have established analytically the asymptotics of the expected Betti numbers of the affine
preferential attachment clique complexes and illustrated them numerically. A number of
open questions remain.
It would be desirable to have sharper estimates of the expected Betti numbers, and finer
descriptions of the distributions of the Betti numbers.
Other topological properties of the preferential attachment graphs are also of interest. To
understand the robustness of the complex, it would be helpful to understand the evolution of
Betti numbers as nodes are removed. One may also consider the Betti numbers of the Rips
complexes of the graph with respect to the graph metric. Beyond Betti numbers, one may
also consider the homotopy type of the random simplicial complexes. Since holes are filled
by later nodes, it is possible that all holes are filled if nodes are added ad infinitum and the
number of edges added each time grows slowly. In particular, Weinberger conjectured that
the resultant complex is contractible in a private conversation.
Other scale-free simplicial complexes are also of interest.
