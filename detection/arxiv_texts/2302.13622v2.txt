Previous symmetry-based database searches have already revealed ubiquitous band topology in nature, while
the destiny of band topology under symmetry-breaking is yet to be studied comprehensively. Here we first de-
velop a framework allowing systematically ascertaining topological state evolution as expressed via a tree-like
graph for magnetic/non-magnetic crystalline material belonging to any of the 1651 magnetic space groups.
Interestingly, we find that specifying different ways of realizing symmetry-breaking leads to various con-
tractions of the tree-like graph, as a new angle of comprehensively characterizing the correlation between a
spontaneous symmetry-breaking and any symmetry-group-indicated physics consequence. We also perform a
high-throughput investigation on the 1267 stoichiometric magnetic materials ever-experimentally synthesized
to reveal a hierarchy of topological states along all continuous paths of symmetry-breaking (preserving the
translation symmetry) from the parent magnetic space group to P1. The results in this work are expected to aid
experimentalists in selecting feasible and appropriate means to tune band topology towards realistic applications
and promote further studies on using tree-like graph to explore the interconnection between topology and other
intriguing orderings.
I. INTRODUCTION
The past nearly two decades have witnessed tremendous
advancements of symmetry-protected topological phases and
topological materials [1–10] reshaping our fundamental un-
derstanding on the electronic properties in solids. In the
well-established paradigm of studying topological phases
in condensed matter, one usually utilizes the symmetry
to classify the protected topological phases, as the ten-
fold way does [11–13]. Very recently, topological quan-
tum chemistry (TQC) [14, 15] or symmetry-indicators (SIs)
[16, 17], have been applied in discovering topological non-
magnetic [18–21]/magnetic [22]/superconducting [23] ma-
terials routinely using the first-principles calculated high-
symmetry point (HSP) symmetry-data with respect to the
space groups/magnetic space groups (MSGs) of the pristine
materials. These database searches reveal the ubiquitous band
topology in nature, protected by the MSG symmetry that de-
scribes the symmetry of spatial arrangement of atoms/ions
(and magnetic structure).
On the other hand, symmetry-breaking can be utilized
in creating new topological phase. For example, quan-
tum anomalous Hall effect was realized through introduc-
ing mass term in the time-reversal symmetry protected sur-
face Dirac fermion by magnetic dopant [24, 25]. Uncon-
ventional fermions can emerge in crystals which break the
Poincar ´ esymmetry [26]. And a higher-order band topol-
ogy is induced by applying strain on SnTe to break the mir-
ror symmetry which originally protects a mirror-symmetry
protected topological crystalline insulating phase [27]. Fur-
thermore, symmetry-breaking due to external fields could act
as a versatile controlling knob on topological states since
such symmetry-breaking can be easily-manipulated, while
that spontaneously caused by a phase transition could bridge
the corresponding ordering and related band topology.
∗fengtang@nju.edu.cnEven though concrete symmetry-breaking cannot be ex-
hausted, we can classify symmetry-breaking by group-
subgroup relations so that various meticulous concrete
symmetry-breaking ways corresponding to one subgroup are
anticipated to share a common topological diagnosing predic-
tion, since only the transformation properties of HSP wave-
functions account [16, 17, 28]. Different from the group-
subgroup relations for the 32 point groups well-tabulated in
many group-theory textbooks, those for the 1651 MSGs have
not yet been obtained. In this work, we first construct all sub-
groups preserving the original translation symmetry (called t-
subgroups) based on the 1651 MSGs, compute the compatibil-
ity relations between the HSPs of the parent MSG and the cor-
responding kpoints for each t-subgroup, laying a foundation
of calculating topological state evolution (TSE) by symmetry-
breaking using SIs [16, 17, 28]. We express TSE by a tree-
like graph showing t-subgroups as vertexes and symmetry-
breaking paths by edges (see Fig. 1). We also perform high-
throughput calculations on the realistic magnetic materials as
listed in MAGNDATA [29], which have been synthesized and
whose magnetic structures have already been deduced experi-
mentally.
Owing to the advanced techniques on ultrafast light and
high magnetic fields, experimentalists are able to apply con-
trollable external stimuli to pristine crystals via symmetry-
breaking to tune the topological states therein guided by the
results of this work. Interestingly, the topological state can
be drastically modified, thus leading to giant quantum re-
sponses which have been observed in realistic materials, such
as the colossal angular magnetoresistance in ferrimagnetic
Mn3Si2Te6[30–32] and the giant anomalous Hall conductiv-
ity in Heusler Co 2MnAl [33], where the topological states are
controlled by rotating the magnetic moments. Hence we ex-
pect our results to aid in unveiling more magnetic topological
materials with unprecedentedly fascinating properties driven
by the change of topological phase.
Interestingly, we also find that by specifying concrete re-
alization of symmetry-breaking, the tree-like graph would bearXiv:2302.13622v2  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  3 Dec 20242
encountered with a contraction (see the dashed circles in Fig.
1(a)) and transform to a different tree-like graph and TSE con-
comitantly. Since the symmetry-breaking could be induced
by some ordering spontaneously, this finding then lays a new
framework of studying the correlation among various types
of orderings and symmetry-group-indicated physical quantity
based on the contracted tree-like graph.
II. RESULTS
We first summarize our results in this part. The results are
categorized into three parts: A framework of computing TSE
using SIs by tree-like graph, high-throughput calculations on
magnetic materials and the contraction by concrete symmetry-
breaking in tree-like graph. As schematically shown in Fig. 1,
corresponding to these parts, we develop three subroutines, re-
spectively, called: “CalTopoEvol”, “MAGNDATASymData”
and “EBSToSubgrps”. Below, we present a brief description
and leave a more detailed description to Supplementary Ma-
terial (SM) [34].
A. Computing TSE using SIs by tree-like graph: CalTopoEvol
In order to find TSE by symmetry-breaking, one need to ex-
haust all subgroups and then depict a tree-like graph (see Fig.
1 for examples) to demonstrate the symmetry-breaking paths:
Each vertex of the tree-like graph denotes one subgroup, and it
is required that one cannot find another subgroup between any
pair of vertexes along any path. In this way, all subgroups are
included with no omission in any symmetry-breaking path.
For example, as shown in Fig. 1(a), there are 7 subgroups,
denoted by 0,1,2, . . . , 6and there are 4 symmetry-breaking
paths: 0→2→3→1,0→4→3→1,0→4→6→1
and0→4→5→1(each arrow connects two subgroups
from a higher symmetry group to a lower one). However,
0→5→1is not a symmetry-breaking path since 4is
between 0 and 5. Here we focus on the t-subgroups for
MSGs. Enumerating all t-subgroups is equivalent to finding
all subgroups of magnetic point group for a given MSG. We
denote each t-subgroup ( G′) by an integer: 0,1,2,. . . (called
symmetry-breaking pattern), and we always let 0 and 1 be
the parent MSG ( G) and P1 respectively. In total, 63 762
t-subgroups are found for the 1651 MSGs. Note that any t-
subgroup is still an MSG, meaning that the atomic-insulator
basis sets [16, 17, 28] and k·pmodels around band cross-
ings (BCs) [35, 36] for the 1651 MSGs still apply. Besides,
note that the HSP of G′is definitely an HSP of G, meaning
that the HSP symmetry-data for the HSPs of Gare sufficient
for the diagnosis of band topology with respect to G′. De-
note the HSP of Gas⃗kand the corresponding kpoint of
G′as⃗k′. One can obtain the compatibility relations (CRs)
between the irreducible representations (irreps) or irreducible
co-representations (co-irreps) of little group of ⃗kand those of⃗k′:
Dj
k→X
j′cjj′Dj′
k′, (1)
and thus,
nj′
k′=X
jcjj′nj
k, (2)
where nj/j′
k/kdenotes the number of occurrences of (co-)irrep
Dj
k/Dj′
k′at⃗k/⃗k′. Eq. 1 can be computed before realistic ma-
terials calculations. It is worth pointing out that once an HSP
is partially occupied (namely, not all (nj
k),s are integers), Eq.
2 might not hold and one need to consider a permutation of
{j′},s that are originated from j(assuming nj
kis not an inte-
ger), as clarified in Sec. S2 of SM [34].
We then use symmetry-data for G′, namely {nj′
k′}, to scan
all high-symmetry lines/planes (HSLs/HSPLs) of G′to detect
enforced BCs. Note that ⃗k′might not be an HSP for G′. Con-
sider an HSL/HSPL of G′,⃗K′. Denote two adjacent kpoints
ofG′lying in the HSL/HSPL as ⃗k′
1and⃗k′
2that are originated
from two HSPs of G, and the symmetry-data are denoted by
nj′
1
k′
1andnj′
2
k′
2, respectively. The CRs from ⃗k1/⃗k2to⃗K′are:
Dj′
1
k′
1→X
j′′dj′
1j′′Dj′′
K′,
Dj′
2
k′
2→X
j′′dj′
2j′′Dj′′
K′,(3)
and then one can obtain the symmetry-data of ⃗K′from both
sides: nj′′
K′=P
j′
1dj′
1j′′nj′
1
k′
1andnj′′
K′=P
j′
2dj′
2j′′nj′
1
k′
2. Once
they are not equal, there exists enforced BC somewhere be-
tween ⃗k′
1and⃗k′
2along ⃗K′. Once no enforced BCs are found
after scanning all HSLs/HSPLs of G′, the symmetry-data at
HSPs of G′are then utilized to be expanded on the atomic
insulator basis for G′to diagnose whether it owns a non-
trivial SI. Note that nj′
1
k′
1andnj′
2
k′
2need to be all integers oth-
erwise BC should be pinned at the corresponding kpoint
(saynj′
1
k′
1is not an integer, BC then appears at ⃗k1′carrying
Dj′
1
k′
1). All the above described steps have already be inte-
grated into CalTopoEvol, and one only need input the par-
ent MSG (in the Belov-Neronova-Smirnova notation [37])
and the corresponding HSP symmetry-data (namely, {nj
k}).
See examples of using CalTopoEvol in Sec. S2 of SM [34].
To make CalTopoEvol used more conveniently, a subroutine
called “ToMSGKpoint” was recently developed, capable of
outputting the inputs of CalTopoEvol given any customized
nonmagnetic/magnetic crystal structure [38].
B. High-throughput calculations: MAGNDATASymData
Of the 1721 magnetic materials in total which we collected
at the time of initiating this work from MAGNDATA [29], we3
Fig.1.Main results. (a) Given HSP symmetry-data, namely, the set of counts of occurrences of (co-)irreps at HSPs,
CalTopoEvol outputs a tree-like graph including all t-subgroups represented by vertexes of the graph. Clicking on each vertex,
a window popups showing detailed topological state diagnosed by SI method. In the right panel, we show an example that
topological state evolves from Dirac semimetal to Weyl semimetal, and then becomes a topological insulator. (b) Note that we
also integrate our high-throughput calculation results in a subroutine called “MAGNDATASymData”, which contains all
successfully computed magnetic materials in MAGNDATA [29] considering different values of Uand varying the electron
filling ( ν) by|ν−ν0| ≤4, where ν0denotes the intrinsic filling. (b) We also develop a subroutine called “EBSToSubgrps”,
which consider seven external fields for each MSG to realize t-subgroups. Note that given a concrete symmetry-breaking, the
tree-like graph might only be contracted from the one shown in (a): “ 0 = 2 = 3 = 4 ” and “4=5=6” denote two contractions
corresponding to red and blue dashed ellipses in (a).
first filter out materials with incommensurate magnetic order-
ing, requiring that the atoms fully occupy their sites, the lat-
tice parameters are compatible with the experimentally iden-
tified MSG and the numbers of ions are compatible with the
composition dictated by the chemical formula. We finally ob-
tain 1267 “high-quality” magnetic materials as our starting
point for subsequent first-principles calculations. The exper-
imentally identified MSGs [29] are set as the parent MSG.
The electron correlation is considered by choosing various
values of Hubbard U, and thus we have 5883 jobs in total
for the 1267 materials (one material with one value of Uis
counted as one job) (see Sec. S6 of SM [34] for details).
Finally, 5062 jobs reach convergence in the first-principles
calculations, and output the convergent magnetic moments.
In Sec. S9 of SM [34], we tabulate all the calculation re-
sults for all the 1267 magnetic materials, where comparison
of first-principles calculated and experimental magnetic mo-
ments and plots of energy bands and density of states (DOS)
can be found. Further ensuring that the converged magnetic
structure preserves the original MSG symmetry, we then have
4012 jobs and for these jobs, we compute the representationsfor all the energy levels at the HSPs for the parent MSG by
the first-principles calculated wave-functions that are then uti-
lized to compute HSP symmetry-data (see Sec. S6 of SM for
details [34]). These jobs correspond to 295 MSGs and 1013
magnetic materials in total. In order to detect all topological
bands around the Fermi level, we vary the electron filling to be
ν=ν0, ν0±1, ν0±2, ν0±3, ν0±4(ν0denotes the intrinsic
filling, which is the number of valence electrons per primitive
unit cell). Note that tuning filling might also lead to different
topological states, as has been realized in a topological phase
change transistor by electrostatic gating [39]. All these HSP
symmetry-data can be retrieved by the subroutine, MAGN-
DATASymData and can be used as the input of CalTopoEvol
to get detailed TSE. See Sec. S3 of SM [34] for examples of
using MAGNDATASymData.
C. Contraction in tree-like graph: EBSToSubgrps
It is worth pointing out that there might exist versatile
concrete ways of symmetry-breaking leading to the same t-4
subgroup, thus sharing the same topological state. Enumerat-
ing all t-subgroups and then depicting the associated tree-like
graph could exhaust all TSEs along all symmetry-breaking
paths, irrespective of how symmetry-breaking is imposed con-
cretely, owing to the fact that the band topology can be diag-
nosed by HSP symmetry-data [16, 17, 28]. However, once re-
stricting concrete way of symmetry-breaking, it is interesting
to find that the corresponding tree-like graph could be con-
tracted to demonstrate a different pattern, as shown in Fig.
1(b), where two different contractions lead to two different
contracted tree-like graphs. Here we consider seven differ-
ent ways of symmetry-breaking and all of them are uniformly
applied to the pristine material that would not break the trans-
lation symmetry, including:
1. Only applying electric field,
2. Only applying magnetic field,
3. Only applying strain field,
4. Simultaneously applying electric and magnetic fields,
5. Simultaneously applying electric and strain fields,
6. Simultaneously applying magnetic and strain fields,
7. Simultaneously applying electric, magnetic and strain fields.
Accordingly, we have developed a subroutine, EBSToSub-
grps, which shows the resulting contracted tree-like graph
(where the applied fields and the preserved operations are in-
dicated in the vertexes) given an MSG and specifying concrete
way of symmetry-breaking. See examples of using EBSTo-
Subgrps in Sec. S4 of SM [34]. Note that the above fields can
also be understood as orderings falling into the same symme-
try class. For example, the electric and magnetic fields corre-
spond to macroscopic electric polarization and magnetization,
respectively. We will show concrete examples in Sec. IV by
MSGs 12.62 and 126.386.
III. SELECTED MAGNETIC TOPOLOGICAL
MATERIALS
Since the parameter Hubbard Ucould change the topology
prediction, we firstly select 236 calculated magnetic materials
that are predicted to be topological for at least 3 different val-
ues of Hubbard U, whose ID,s in MAGNDATA [29] are listed
in Table I. It is also found that the number of magnetic topo-
logical materials hosting such robustness against Uis gradu-
ally increased to 725 when the fillings satisfying |∆ν| ≤4
(∆ν=ν−ν0) as shown in Fig. S10 of SM [34], indicating
that more than 70% of the investigated magnetic materials can
be topological.
We also manually select 9 magnetic topological materials
whose electronic band plots are depicted in Fig. 3, owning
either a noticeable band gap or enforced BC almost at the
Fermi level. The materials in Fig. 3 are topological for at
least four values of Uexcept Sr 2TbIrO 6, for which only two
jobs ( U=0, 4 eV) reach convergence. Roughly speaking,
topological classification being case II/III definitely means the
material is topological while case I means that the material ispossibly topologically trivial [28, 40]. See Sec. S2 of SM
[34] for details on case I/II/III. Note that different values of U
might correspond to different topological classifications (case
II/III) in UAsS and Ba 3CoIr 2O9. For others, different values
ofUgive the same classification of either case II or case III.
By symmetry-breaking, the nontrivial band topology in
these materials can be maintained, transformed or trivialized.
For example, the topological classifications for Sr 2TbIrO 6
withU= 0 and 4 eV are identical, with respect to all t-
subgroups (including the parent MSG): for the parent group,
SI= (1) ∈Z2and for t-subgroup MSG 2.4, SI =
(0,0,0,2)∈Z2×Z2×Z2×Z4[17] while for other t-
subgroups, the classifications are case I. Besides, 21 of the 35
t-subgroups for UAsS ( U=0, 2, 4, 6 eV) give case II/case III
prediction, indicating the robustness of nontrivial band topol-
ogy against symmetry-breaking. For CaMnSi ( U=0, 1, 2,
3 eV), 5 of the 35 t-subgroups give case II while the rest
give case I. For CsMnF 4withU= 0,1,2,3eV , the topo-
logical classifications share the same result with respect to all
t-subgroups. For this material, 8 of the 16 t-subgroups give
case III prediction and the rest give case I, and the enforced
BCs include two pairs of opposite-charged iso-energetic Weyl
points and one Weyl nodal line for the parent MSG. The Weyl
points of each pair are related by inversion symmetry. By
symmetry-breaking, the original Weyl points/nodal line can
be gapped: For example, with respect to the t-subgroup MSG
6.18, the original Weyl points are all gapped while the origi-
nal Weyl nodal line still exists); With respect to the t-subgroup
MSG 18.19, the original inversion related Weyl points are al-
lowed to own different energies since the inversion symmetry
is broken in this t-subgroup. For the 9 materials in Fig. 3, we
provide details in Sec. S3 of SM [34] to demonstrate the di-
agnosis of band topology combining MAGNDATASymData
and CalTopoEvol.
IV . EXAMPLES
In the following, we take HoB 2and CeMn 2Si2as examples
to show the detailed TSEs along the continuous symmetry-
breaking paths.
A. Materials example: HoB 2
HoB 2is classified to belong to case II. The ID in MAGN-
DATA [29] is 0.616. HoB 2in the paramagnetic state is crys-
tallized in a hexagonal lattice with a very simple crystal struc-
ture containing only one chemical formula per primitive unit
cell, while a ferromagnetic state breaks the three-fold rotation
symmetry, resulting in MSG 12.62, ever reported to display
a gigantic magnetocaloric effect [41, 42]. The resulting mag-
netic point group consists of E, I,ΘC2zandΘσzwhere E
andIare unitary operations (identity and spatial inversion,
respectively). The other two are antiunitary operations ( Θde-
notes the time-reversal operation, C2zis the 2-fold rotation
around z-axis and σzis a mirror operation). To list all t-
subgroups, one only need to enumerate all subgroups of the5

Besides, for MSG 12.62, all energy bands should be non-
degenerate by symmetry requirements, and also, BCs are not
allowed to exist stably at the special kpoints. MSG 12.62
owns a nontrivial SI group [17]: Z2×Z2×Z4. Indeed,
for all t-subgroups, HoB 2can only be case I or case II as
shown for different fillings in the lower panel of Fig. 3(a)
(ν=ν0, ν0−1, ν0+ 1, ν0+ 2andν0+ 3) which characterize
the TSEs by the tree-like graphs. The fillings correspond to
the gaps shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3(a), indicated by
different colors. Note that there are considerable gaps for the
filling ν0+ 1(the region in orange in the upper panel of Fig.
3(a)), the nontrivial topology of which is expected to bring
about noticeable protected boundary states. Such gaps share
the same TSEs as those for another three fillings as shown in
the lower panel of Fig. 3(a), where the colors shown in the in-
set correspond to the gaps in the respective colors of the band
plot. Interestingly, the quasi-flat bands (whose band indices
areν0+ 2 andν0+ 3) are found to topological. The co-
existence of magnetic order, topological quasi-flat bands and
multiple topological gaps around the Fermi level makes this
material a fascinating platform to study possible exotic quan-
tum excitations.B. Materials example: CeMn 2Si2
We then show another example for CeMn 2Si2whose ID in
MAGNDATA is 1.490 [29] and MSG is 126.386. The Ce ion
is found to own vanishing magnetic moment while the magni-
tude of the magnetic moments in Mn ions are found to be 1.9
µB experimentally [43]. Here we chose the results for the cal-
culations in which all the values of Uon the Ce and Mn ions
are0eV , in which the calculated magnetic moments reason-
ably reproduce those by experiments. It is noted that the other
results for the rest values of Ushare similar topological prop-
erties discussed here. Consider the intrinsic filling. With re-
spect to the parent MSG, CeMn 2Si2is predicted to be in case
III and furthermore, the HSP symmetry-data guarantee that
the enforced BCs appear in HSLs, (0, w,1
2)and(w, w,1
2), as
shown in Fig. 3(b), where these BCs are also verified from
the computed representations of a dense k-point mesh in the
HSLs. The BCs in these HSLs actually lie in a Dirac nodal
line within an HSPL ( (u, v,1
2)) by CRs. Then consider the
effect of the symmetry-breaking. These Dirac nodal lines can
be gapped for some symmetry-breaking patterns, resulting in
a possibly-trivial insulator (in case I) or a topological phase
in case II. For other symmetry-breaking patterns, the result-
ing topological phases are all in case III, and furthermore, we
find that the corresponding enforced BC lies in either Dirac
nodal line or Weyl nodal line. We collect the TSEs for this
material in Fig. 3(c) along all symmetry-breaking paths con-
taining the symmetry-breaking patterns with topological clas-
sifications being case II/III.
V . CONTRACTION OF TREE-LIKE GRAPH
We then discuss an interesting finding that the tree-like
graphs could be contracted in different patterns when we spec-6

ify different concrete realizations of symmetry-breaking. As
has been schematically shown in Fig. 1(b), the general tree-
like graph shown in Fig. 1(a) could transform into another
different patterns once for the symmetry-breaking patterns be-
ing 0, 2, 3 and 4 (or for those being 4, 5 and 6), the concrete
realizations of symmetry-breaking take the same form (e.g.
electric fields are all long zdirection). Take MSG 12.62 and
its t-subgroups as an example. Once we only apply magnetic
field, ⃗B(or a variation of magnetization ⃗M∼⃗B), only the
t-subgroups with symmetry-breaking patterns 0 and 2 can be
realized, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Once we only apply elec-
tric field, ⃗E(or an electric polarization ⃗P∼⃗E), only the
t-subgroups with symmetry-breaking patterns 0, 3, 4 and 1
can be realized, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Only when we con-
sider the aforementioned two types of fields/orderings simul-
taneously, all t-subgroups can be realized. As shown in the
lower inset of Fig. 4(a), different orderings can lead to dif-
ferent switching patterns along all symmetry-breaking paths.
For HoB 2as described above, we can infer that once the non-
trivial band topology is preserved in a process of phase transi-tion, a macroscopic electric polarization is not sufficient since
it could break inversion symmetry that protects the topology.
In Fig. 4(b), we show another example using MSG 126.386,
that applying ⃗Eand⃗Bwould give rise to the same tree-like
graph pattern but the detailed t-subgroups in the vertexes of
the tree-like graph are totally different. From Fig. 3(c), one
can conclude that applying ⃗Ewould gap the original Dirac
lines or transform them to Weyl nodal lines. However, apply-
ing⃗Bwould definitely gap these Dirac nodal lines.
VI. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE
To conclude, the three subroutines obtained in this work are
expected guide experimentalists to choose suitable material
and specify concrete symmetry-breaking, which might pave
the avenue to the realization of highly-sensitive magnetism-
controlled band topology. The high-throughput calculation
results can also be used as the training dataset to develop
a simple-to-use heuristic chemical rule of diagnosing band7

Fig.3.TSEs in HoB 2and CeMn 2Si2.In the upper panel of (a), we show the band structure where all the bands are
nondegenerate and the plot of DOS for HoB 2. The continuous gaps corresponding to the intrinsic filling ν0and the fillings
ν0−1, ν0+ 1, ν0+ 2, ν0+ 3are indicated by the regions in yellow, cyan, orange, green and magenta, respectively. The lower
panel of (a) shows the tree-like graphs for the TSE corresponding to the gaps indicated by the colors shown in the insets. The
symmetry-breaking patterns: 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, correspond to the t-subgroups being MSGs 12.62, 1.1, 2.4, 5.15 and 8.34,
respectively. Note that the peaks in DOS correspond to the two bands (the band indices are ν0+ 2andν0+ 3) indicated by the
white double-arrow. Such quasi-flat bands are found to be topological. In (b), we show the band structures for CeMn 2Si2along
two HSLs, (0, w,1/2)and(w, w, 1/2), where the orange and blue colors encode two different co-irreps of the corresponding
HSLs. Various BCs composed of these co-irreps can be found and two BCs indicated by the red arrows are deduced by the
symmetry-data at A and Z, and the symmetry-data Z and R, respectively (see Eq. 3). Note that in each of these HSLs, there
exists another BC dictated by an MSG operation. (c) shows the tree-like graph for the evolution of the original Dirac nodal
lines in CeMn 2Si2. In each circle, the integer denotes the symmetry-breaking pattern, II stands for case II and WNL/DNL
stands for Weyl nodal line/Dirac nodal line in case III.
topology such as the topogivity [44] by machine-learning.
Note that the predicted TSE is irrelevant with the origin
of concrete symmetry-breaking, while a concrete symmetry-
breaking leading to a contraction of the tree-like graph re-
lates TSE with the symmetry-breaking origin. Similar scheme
could be established for superconductors [23, 45]. Note that
the developed subroutines CalTopoEvol and EBSToSubgrps
can be applied to both nonmagnetic and magnetic materials.
It is also worth pointing out that detailed band topology desig-
nating where the protected boundary states can be found can
be obtained by checking the results as listed in Refs. [46, 47].
The correlation of magnetism and nontrivial band topol-ogy with other ordering, such as ferroelectric order [48], and
novel crystal structure (e.g. Kagom ´ elattice [49], and see Ta-
ble I and Sec. 8 of SM [34] for selected magnetic materials
with Kagom ´ esublattice), merits future studies by choosing
suitable candidates from our predicted magnetic topological
materials. Besides, a more generic symmetry-breaking could
include the translation symmetry breaking enlarging the prim-
itive unit cell and lead to Brillouin zone folding (e.g. a charge-
density wave order [50, 51]), which is not exhaustible, but can
still apply the t-subgroups after firstly identifying the maximal
subgroup(s), of which the details are described in Sec. S5 of
SM [34].8
Fig.4.Contraction of tree-like graph in MSGs 12.62 and 126.386. (a) Consider MSG 12.62. EBSToSubgrps can quickly
output the contracted tree-like graph by applying ⃗Bor⃗Eor simultaneously applying ⃗Eand⃗Bas shown here. Concretely,
applying ⃗Bwould result in t-subgroups by 0 and 2 ( ⃗B= (Bx, By,0)and(Bx, By, Bz), respectively). Applying ⃗Ewould result
in t-subgroups by 0, 1, 3 and 4 ( ⃗E= (0,0,0),(Ex, Ey, Ez),(0,0, Ez)and(Ex, Ey,0), respectively). Simultaneously applying
⃗Eand⃗Bresult in all t-subgroups, 0,1,2,3and4({⃗E,⃗B}={(0,0,0),(Bx, By,0)},{(Ex, Ey, Ez),(Bx, By, Bz)},
{(0,0,0),(Bx, By, Bz)},{(0,0, Ez),(Bx, By,0)}and{(Ex, Ey,0),(Bx, By,0)}, respectively). The contractions shown by
blue and red dashed ellipses in the tree-like graph labeled by “E+B” results in different resulting tree-like graphs labeled by “B”
and “E”, respectively. In the lower panel, we show that the continuous switching of macroscopic electric polarization ⃗Por/and
magnetization ⃗Mfor each tree-like graph, demonstrating their emergence accompanying the symmetry-breaking (and TSE). (b)
MSG 126.386 owns in total 158 t-subgroups, and 1581 symmetry-breaking paths from symmetry-breaking pattern 0 (the parent
MSG) to symmetry-breaking pattern 1 (P1), while applying ⃗Eor⃗B, only partial subgroups can be realized and are shown here.
The corresponding tree-like graphs applying ⃗Eand⃗Bshare the same form but contain different t-subgroups as indicated in the
vertexes (say, a, bmeans that adenotes the t-subgroup for ⃗Eandbrepresents the t-subgroup for ⃗B, respectively). Detailed
symmetry operations that are presented by various fields can be found by EBSToSubgrps.
