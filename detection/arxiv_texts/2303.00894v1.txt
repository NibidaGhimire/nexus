Abstract
Reward learning algorithms utilize human feedback to infer a reward function, which is then used to train an AI system. This
human feedback is often a preference comparison, in which the human teacher compares several samples of AI behavior
and chooses which they believe best accomplishes the objective. While reward learning typically assumes that all feedback
comes from a single teacher, in practice these systems often query multiple teachers to gather sufficient training data. In this
paper, we investigate this disparity, and find that algorithmic evaluation of these different sources of feedback facilitates
more accurate and efficient reward learning. We formally analyze the value of information (VOI) when reward learning
from teachers with varying levels of rationality, and define and evaluate an algorithm that utilizes this VOI to actively select
teachers to query for feedback. Surprisingly, we find that it is often more informative to query comparatively irrational
teachers. By formalizing this problem and deriving an analytical solution, we hope to facilitate improvement in reward
learning approaches to aligning AI behavior with human values.

1. Introduction
Standard AI and machine learning algorithms require the
designer to specify a cost or reward function. This objec-
tive incentivizes desired behavior and penalizes mistakes,
teaching the system how to perform the task. While
such objectives are easy to manually specify for prob-
lems with clear win conditions, such as games [ 1,2,3] and
tasks with clear goals, such as image classification [ 4,5],
they can be challenging to formalize for more nuanced
tasks [ 6]. For example, Lee et al. [7]find that humans
struggle to define an objective that incentivizes bipedal
locomotion, despite being experts in both machine learn-
ing and walking. By incentivizing incorrect behavior,
misspecified objectives can lead to useless or even dan-
gerous outcomes [ 8]. Ensuring that AI systems optimize
objectives that align with our own is a crucial part of
building safe and beneficial AI.
Reward learning techniques enable AI systems to learn
their objectives by observing and interacting with hu-
mans instead of requiring their designers to specify these
objectives manually [ 9]. Humans can train reward learn-
ing systems using a variety of feedback modalities, in-
cluding demonstrations [ 10,11,12], pairwise compar-
isons [ 7,13,14], natural language [ 15], numeric val-
ues [ 16], corrections [ 17], and proxy rewards [ 18,19].
Reward learning from pairwise comparisons in particu-
lar has proven remarkably effective across a variety of
tasks, including complex physical maneuvers for con-
tinuous control systems [ 7,14] and text summarization

CEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org)for language language models [ 20,21]. In the future, it
may even be possible to use reward learning to train AI
systems to assist humans in researching safe AI [8, 22].
However, to infer reward functions from human
feedback, reward learning systems must model human
decision-making, and incorrect human decision-making
models often leads to poor inference [ 23,24,25]. More-
over, reward learning systems typically assume that all
feedback comes from a single distribution or teacher, de-
spite querying multiple teachers to generate sufficient
feedback. However, humans often vary in their expertise,
focus, and intelligence, affecting the noisiness of their
feedback. The practice of conflating all feedback implic-
itly disregards the differences between different teachers,
increasing the likelihood of human model misspecifica-
tion and the limitations of reward learning [26].
In this work, we extend reward learning to take ad-
vantage of differences between teachers. We develop a
Bayesian reward learning algorithm that actively selects
which teacher to query based on the noisiness of their
feedback and the learner‚Äôs current belief. We find that
querying a lessrational teacher can often be more in-
formative than querying a more rational teacher, since
teacher mistakes inform the agent of the relative values of
alternatives. For example, imagine that two teachers are
comparing two alternatives, ùê¥andùêµ.ùê¥is worth more
thanùêµ, but only slightly. If the first teacher is perfectly
rational, they will always select ùê¥overùêµ. The learner
can infer from this that ùê¥is preferable to ùêµ, but has no
way to learn how significant the distinction is. However,
assume that the second teacher is somewhat less ratio-
nal, and occasionally mixes up alternatives of similar
value. Then they will typically choose ùê¥, but sometimes
choose ùêµ, and this allows the learner to infer that the
gap between ùê¥andùêµis small. Section 3 formalizes thisarXiv:2303.00894v1  [cs.LG]  2 Mar 2023rationality model and inference procedure.
The rest of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we dis-
cuss prior work on reward learning, active learning, and
human modeling. In Section 3, we describe the mechan-
ics of reward learning, including the model of human
rationality and the metrics that will be used to measure
the value of information (VOI) of teacher feedback. In
Section 4, we propose a teacher selection algorithm that
selects which teacher to query for feedback at each time
step based on the modeled rationality of each teacher and
the learner‚Äôs belief distribution over the reward function.
In Sections 5 and 6, we present theoretical and empirical
results, showing that the learner‚Äôs belief will eventually
converge to the true reward function under the teacher
selection algorithm, that querying less rational teachers
can often be more informative, and that our teacher selec-
tion method outperforms simple heuristics like always
querying the most rational teacher. By formalizing the
problem of learning from multiple teachers and deriving
an analytical solution, we hope to facilitate improvement
in reward learning approaches to value alignment.
2. Related Work
Reward Learning Reward learning techniques allow
AI systems to learn reward functions by observing or
interacting with humans. For example, inverse reinforce-
ment learning agents observe human behavior or policies,
and then infer an underlying reward function that the be-
havior optimizes [ 10,11,12]. Recent advances in reward
learning have focused on learning from preference com-
parisons. Here, human teachers observe paired samples
of system behavior, then choose which sample they prefer
out of each pair. The system learns a reward model that
maximizes the likelihood of these preferences, then uses
that model to generate a reward signal to guide its behav-
ior. This technique has been successfully applied to many
domains, from continuous control [ 7,14] to language
generation tasks [ 20,21]. Reward learning can also use a
variety of other feedback modalities, including preference
comparisons [ 7,13,14], natural language [ 15], numeric
values [ 16], corrections [ 17], and proxy rewards [ 18,19],
but we focus on preference comparisons in this paper
due to its recent success.
Active Reward Learning Human feedback is expen-
sive and time-consuming to generate, so reward learn-
ing algorithms must learn efficiently from limited data.
They do this in part by actively selecting the queries that
are sent to human teachers in order to maximize the ex-
pected VOI of human feedback. Sadigh et al. [13]assume
that the system is a Bayesian learner, actively synthesiz-
ing queries that maximize the expected volume removed
from the learner‚Äôs posterior. Bƒ±yƒ±k and Sadigh [27] de-

velop efficient approximations to this method and show
how to integrate active query selection and reward learn-
ing in practice. Lee et al. [7]take a different approach,
empirically evaluating various heuristic strategies for
query selection and finding that uncertainty-based sam-
pling methods tend to perform the best. However, all of
this previous work focuses on choosing which queries to
send to the teachers. In this paper, we instead consider
which teachers to send these queries to.
Human Modeling To infer reward functions, AI sys-
tems must model the behavior of humans. Early work on
reward learning assumed that human behavior was per-
fectly rational and that human teachers always chose the
alternative that maximized their reward [ 10]. Later work
models human behavior as pedagogic [ 24], systematically
biased [ 28], and noisily or Boltzmann-rational [ 9,12].
We will follow recent work on learning from human
preferences [ 7,9,12,14] and model human teachers as
Boltzmann-rational, making choices according to a well-
known probability model specified later in the paper.
3. Active Reward Learning
In this section, we formalize the problem of selecting the
most informative teacher to query in order to gradually
learn the correct reward model. In particular, we are
interested in greedily selecting the teacher to query at
each time step such that the reward model of the agent
efficiently converges to the correct reward model.
At a high level, the teacher selection problem begins
with a set of items or trajectories to compare, along with a
set of human teachers to evaluate those comparisons. The
human teachers each have a different level of rationality
that is known a priori , meaning that the probability of a
given human teacher making a mistake by preferring a
less valuable item over a more valuable item is known in
advance. During each time step of our approach depicted
in Figure 1, two items are sampled from the set of items
(Step 1 ) and then a human teacher is selected to be queried
based on these items and the current belief about thereward model ( Step 2 ). The human teacher is asked which
of the two items they prefer ( Step 3 ), and their preference
is used to update the reward model ( Step 4 ). This process
of selecting a query and a teacher is repeated until the
reward model converges to the correct reward model.
Query selection is the problem of choosing which items
to present to the teacher [7]. Some approaches to query
selection include choosing the pair of items for which the
preference predictors are most uncertain [ 7,14]. Other
approaches to query selection include selecting the pair
of items that ensure that the space of queries is well cov-
ered. Finally, there are more active methods that actively
synthesize queries in order learn more efficiently [ 13,29].
Since our focus is on teacher selection rather than query
selection, for the purposes of our analysis we will assume
that queries are sampled uniformly at random. However,
existing methods for query selection can be easily com-
bined with our teacher selection algorithm to further
improve reward learning.
To formalize the problem of teacher selection, this sec-
tion proceeds as follows. We (1) provide a representation
of items and rewards, (2) apply a well-known model of
human rationality to our problem, (3) offer a method for
updating belief distributions that uses preference compar-
isons from a human teacher, and (4) propose two metrics
that measure the correctness of a belief distribution.
Representing Items and Rewards Intuitively, each
item can be represented as a set of features. For example,
a book could be described by the number of pages and
the number of positive reviews or a maneuver made by
a self-driving car could be described by its position and
distance from other vehicles at each time step. Hence,
each item ùëñcan formally be represented by a feature
vector ùúëùëñ‚ààRùëëwhere ùëëis the number of features that
describe the ùëñth item.
Given this representation of an item, the reward ùëÖ(ùëñ)
for an item ùëñcan be expressed as a dot product between
the feature vector ùúëùëñand the weight vector w‚ààRùëëfor
the reward model that is being learned:
ùëÖ(ùëñ) =w‚ä§ùúëùëñ. (1)
If the items cannot be expressed by a feature vector, this
approach can still be used by treating the feature vector
ùúëùëñas a one-hot vector: given the ùëñth item, the ùëñth entry
of the feature vector ùúëùëñwould be 1and every other entry
would be 0while the ùëñth entry of the weight vector w
would be the reward ùëÖ(ùëñ)for the ùëñth item.
During reward learning, the human teacher is pre-
sented with two items and the probability of the human
choosing one item over another item depends on the dif-
ference in reward between the two items at hand. We
therefore express the difference in the reward between
two items ùëñandùëóas the equation
ùëÖ(ùëñ)‚àíùëÖ(ùëó) =w‚ä§(ùúëùëñ‚àíùúëùëó) =w‚ä§ùúôùëñùëó, (2)where ùúôùëñùëó=ùúëùëñ‚àíùúëùëóis the difference in the feature
vectors of the two items.
Modeling Human Rationality Human teachers can
be represented as Boltzmann-rational agents following
a large body of existing work on reward learning [ 7,9,
12,14,30,31,32,33,34]. Moreover, we assume that each
teacher has a different known rationality parameter ùõΩ
rather than assuming ùõΩ= 1for all teachers. Boltzmann-
rational teachers are more likely to choose the higher
reward item if they are ‚Äúmore rational" (i.e., a higher ùõΩ),
or if the difference in reward between the two items is
greater. The probability that the teacher chooses an item
ùëñover and an item ùëóis given by
ùëÉ(ùëñ‚âªùëó;ùõΩ) =exp(ùõΩùëÖ(ùëñ))
exp(ùõΩùëÖ(ùëñ)) + exp( ùõΩùëÖ(ùëó)).(3)
We thus model the human choice probabilistically:
ùëÉ(ùêº|w;ùúôùëñùëó, ùõΩ) =1
1 + exp(‚àíùêºùõΩw‚ä§ùúôùëñùëó), (4)
where ùêº= +1 if the human prefers item ùëñover item ùëó
andùêº=‚àí1if the human prefers item ùëóover item ùëñ. This
reflects the difference in value of the two items but not
their absolute value. Equation 4 is a logistic model of
the probability of the human preference ùêº, where ùõΩde-
termines the slope. As the difference in reward between
the two items increases, the probability that the teacher
chooses the higher reward item approaches 1.
Updating Belief Distributions The goal of reward
learning is to learn the weight vector wof the reward
model. Given the preference of a teacher ùêº, the difference
in feature vectors ùúôùëñùëó, and the teacher‚Äôs rationality pa-
rameter ùõΩ, the learner updates its belief over the weights
of the reward model. That is, the belief over the weights
of the reward model is updated such that the reward
model now predicts that the item selected by the teacher
is more valuable than it was prior to the belief update.
Formally, we begin with the current belief distribution
ùëÉ(w), which we treat as the prior distribution, and up-
date it according to Bayes‚Äô theorem in the following way:
ùëÉ(w|ùêº;ùúôùëñùëó, ùõΩ) =ùëÉ(ùêº|w;ùúôùëñùëó, ùõΩ)ùëÉ(w)‚à´Ô∏Ä
ùëÉ(ùêº|w‚Ä≤;ùúôùëñùëó, ùõΩ)ùëÉ(w‚Ä≤)ùëëw‚Ä≤,(5)
where ùëÉ(ùêº|w;ùúôùëñùëó, ùõΩ)is given by Equation 4.
Measuring Belief Distribution Error After query-
ing a teacher and updating the belief over the weights
of the reward model w, the belief distribution can be
evaluated on a metric that measures the ‚Äúcorrectness‚Äù or
the distance of this belief distribution to the true belief
distribution. Here, we consider two such metrics: theTable 1
The general form of an expected metric ‚Ñ≥along with the expected metrics for mean squared error (MSE) and log loss (LL).

mean squared error ( MSE ) and the log loss ( LL). The
MSE measure represents how ‚Äúfar away‚Äù the belief dis-
tribution is from the true value while the LLmeasure
represents the height of the belief distribution at the true
value. In both cases, a lower score indicates a more accu-
rate distribution. Using ùëÑ(w)as the belief distribution
over the weight vector wandwtrueas the true weight
vector, the MSE andLLmeasures are given as follows.
MSE( ùëÑ(w),wtrue) =‚à´Ô∏Å
ùëÑ(w)||w‚àíwtrue||2ùëëw(6)
LL(ùëÑ(w),wtrue) =‚àílog(ùëÑ(wtrue)) (7)
Note that we will describe a greedy approach that selects
the teacher that in expectation leads to our belief distri-
bution scoring the best on one of these metrics after a
single update in the next section.
Work on active learning from human preferences uses
volume removal (i.e., removing as much of the integral of
the unnormalized distribution as possible) as a metric [ 13,
27,33]. However, this may not be an appropriate metric
for teacher selection. This is because a larger Boltzmann
rationality parameter ùõΩresults in a larger volume of the
belief distribution being removed but may not necessarily
lead to a more accurate belief distribution.
4. Teacher Selection
We propose a method for selecting and querying the
teacher that produces the best immediate improvement
in the expectation of a given metric, which approximates
the expected VOI of the teacher feedback. The metrics
evaluate how similar the posterior belief is to the ground
truth reward, so lower scores indicate improvements in
the learned reward model. The algorithm considers un-
certainty over two variables: the ground-truth parameter-
ization of the reward model and the item from the query
that the teacher prefers. In particular, the expectation of
the metric must be taken over the current belief distri-
bution ùëÉ(w)and the probability ùëÉ(ùêº|w;ùúôùëñùëó, ùõΩ)of the
teacher preferring each item. Formally, we express the
expectation of a given metric ‚Ñ≥in Table 1. Note that weuse the notation ùëÉw=ùëÉ(w),ùëÉùêº|w=ùëÉ(ùêº|w;ùúôùëñùëó, ùõΩ),
andùëÉw|ùêº=ùëÉ(w|ùêº, ùúôùëñùëó, ùõΩ)throughout this section.
Importantly, the expected value of a given metric only
depends on the known variables ùúôùëñùëóandùõΩalong with
the current belief distribution ùëÉwgiven a straightfor-
ward substitution of Equations 4 and 5. This enables our
method to calculate the expected value of the metric for
a given teacher with the rationality parameter ùõΩ. This
will be used to find the teacher to query at each time step:
the teacher with the lowest metric in expectation should
be selected as that would result in a weight vector that is
closest to the true weight vector in expectation.
Finally, given the general form of an expected met-
ric, Table 1 defines the expectations of the MSE and
LL metrics using the function ùëìùêº(w) = ùëÉw/(1 +
exp(‚àíùêºùõΩw‚ä§ùúôùëñùëó)).
Selecting a Teacher To select the teacher to query,
we first calculate the expected metric for each teacher
ùõΩgiven the current belief distribution ùëÉ(w)and then
select the teacher that would result in the lowest expected
metric score. Formally, the rationality parameter ùõΩ*that
leads to the largest reduction in the expectation of the
metric is defined as follows:

where ùõΩis a vector of the ùõΩvalues of the teachers.
Learning a Reward Model To learn the reward
model, the learner begins with an initial belief distri-
bution ùëÉwover the reward function parameterization
and then updates it according to Algorithm 1. First, the
algorithm generates queries of paired items and calcu-
latesùõΩ*, which is the rationality parameter that leads
to the largest improvement in the expectation over the
correctness metric. The algorithm queries the teacher
with this rationality parameter, and the teacher responds
with a preference indicating which of the two items in the
query they prefer. This preference is used to update theAlgorithm 1: LearnRewardModel (¬∑)

5. Theoretical Analysis
In this section, we first prove that the belief distribution
will converge to the true distribution and then show that,
under certain conditions, querying a less rational teacher
can result in more informative feedback.
Convergence Algorithm 1 queries multiple teachers
with different ùõΩvalues until the reward estimate conver-
gences. Here, we show that this process will make the
belief distribution over wconverge to the true value.
Theorem 1. In the limit of ùëÅ‚Üí‚àû random queries to
Boltzmann-rational teachers with positive, finite ùõΩvalues,
the posterior distribution over wconverges to the true value.
Proof. The likelihood of a sequence of human choices

We can show that BF‚Üí0asùëÅ‚Üí‚àû except whenw=wtrue. This implies ùëÉ(w|ùêº;ùõΩ)‚Üí0except when
w=wtrue. We require ùëÉ(wtrue)Ã∏= 0asBFis undefined
otherwise. Trivially, BF = 1 whenw=wtrue.
We now consider wÃ∏=wtrue. We can define the nega-

ine each term in the sum and show that in expectation
they are each positive. All of these terms are independent
as they are only depend on the likelihood and not on the
current distribution. Hence, they will not decay with
additional steps, and so the sum will diverge if the indi-
vidual terms are positive in expectation. The expected
value for each term in the sum is

This is the KL divergence between ùëÉ(ùêºùëñ|wtrue;ùõΩùëñ)and

ùõΩ= 0 , each of these terms equals 0. As ùõΩ‚Üí ‚àû ,

step function. In this case, it holds that ùëÉ(ùêºùëñ|w;ùõΩùëñ) =
ùëÉ(ùêºùëñ|wtrue;ùõΩùëñ)whenever the values w‚ä§ùúôandw‚ä§

have the same sign.
Therefore, for positive, finite ùõΩeach of the terms in

Bigger ùõΩisn‚Äôt always more informative Querying
a more rational teacher (with a larger ùõΩvalue) does not
always lead to faster convergence to the true value, as
measured by lower MSE or LL, because the magnitude of
w‚ä§ùúôùëñùëócan be learned from the teacher making mistakes.
We empirically observe this in Figure 2, where we
demonstrate that if our current belief distribution ùëÉ(w)
is a normal distribution characterized by ùúáandùúé, a lower
ùõΩvalue is more informative for certain values of ùúáandùúé.
Specifically, when the distribution is symmetric ( ùúá= 0)
then a larger value of ùõΩis better, and as the distribution
gets broader (larger ùúé) larger ùõΩis also better. If the dis-
tribution is very wide then a large ùõΩallows us to quicklyFigure 2: For some prior beliefs over w, querying a teacher
with a lower ùõΩparameter is more informative. The plots show
the most informative ùõΩvalue (according to the mean squared
error and log loss metrics, respectively) for a range of beliefs.

andùúé(vertical axis). The purple regions of the plots indicate
beliefs where it is most informative to query a teacher with a

remove a lot of probability mass, while if the distribution
is narrow (and asymmetric) then we learn about the value
ofw‚ä§ùúôùëñùëófrom the humans making mistakes, which re-
quires the human to be less than perfectly rational. For
example, if w‚ä§ùúôùëñùëó>0then a perfectly rational human
would always choose item ùëñover item ùëó, and we would
not learn about the actual value ofw‚ä§ùúôùëñùëó.
6. Restaurant Recommendation
We now discuss how our method for reward learning
using feedback from multiple teachers can be applied
to a simplified restaurant recommendation domain. In
this domain, the goal is to learn a reward function that
can be used to recommend restaurants to a user. This re-
ward model must be learned from feedback from multiple
teachers, in this case by asking which of two restaurants
a human prefers. It is important to highlight that our
approach is compatible with a variety of popular rec-
ommendation tasks, including entertainment [ 35,36],
news [37], and shopping [38] recommendations.
More formally, the problem of restaurant recommen-
dation has a set of restaurants ùúå={ùúå1, ùúå2, . . . , ùúå ùëõ}
that can be recommended to a user. Moreover, there
is a set of users ùëà={ùëà1, ùëà2, . . . , ùëà ùëö}who can
be queried about their restaurant preferences. Each
restaurant is expressed as a set of features ùêπ=
{Cleanliness ,Vegan ,Spiciness}where Cleanliness‚àà
[1,10] describes the cleanliness of the restaurant,
Vegan‚àà {0,1}describes whether the restaurant is
vegan-friendly, and Spiciness‚àà[1,10]describes the
spiciness of the food. The preference rating for each
restaurant is denoted by w‚ä§ùúåùëñ, where w‚ààR3is a
weight vector that parameterizes the reward model. Theaim is to learn the weights wusing feedback from multi-
ple users to provide useful restaurant recommendations.
We can represent the restaurant recommendation do-
main using our approach. The set of items ùúë1, ùúë2, . . . , ùúë ùëõ
is the set of restaurants ùúå. The set of human users ùëàis
the set of human teachers. The users are modelled as
Boltzmann-rational, and have known rationality parame-
tersùõΩ1, ùõΩ2, . . . , ùõΩ ùëö. Beginning with an initial distribu-
tionùëÉ(w), we will use Algorithm 1 to converge to the
weight values for the reward function that represents the
user preferences. First, we select a pair of restaurants for
a user to compare (in this case randomly selected) and ap-
ply Equation 8 describing which user should be queried
in order to achieve the lowest metric score in expectation
after a single update. Next, this user is selected and then
asked which of the two restaurants they prefer. Finally,
using the selected user‚Äôs preference, the reward model
weights are updated according to Equation 5 to generate
a new belief distribution. The process is repeated until
the belief distribution converges.
7. Experiments
We now show that our approach method for selecting
ùõΩoutperforms several baseline methods, using the sim-
ple restaurant recommendation domain. In Figure 3, we
compare: (1) selecting the largest ùõΩvalue to see if the
result that larger ùõΩis not always better is true in practice;
(2) selecting ùõΩrandomly to ensure that the advantage
over selecting the largest ùõΩis not just due to the ran-
domness of the selection; and (3) always selecting ùõΩ= 1
because this is often what is assumed to be the rationality
parameter in other work.
In this experiment, the size of the weight vector is
ùëë= 3and the domain of the weights is ùëä= [‚àí10,10]3,
which is discretized. The prior distribution of the weights
is a uniform distribution over this domain ùëÉ(w) =
ùí∞(ùëä)and the true weight wtrue‚ààùëäis sampled from
this prior. There are 21 teachers, with ùõΩvalues uniformly
spaced between 0 and 4. For 100 steps, two restaurant fea-
ture vectors ùúë={Cleanliness ,Vegan ,Spiciness}are
generated randomly, where Cleanliness ,Spiciness‚àº
ùí∞(1,10), and Vegan are uniformly drawn from {0,1}.
While we generate our samples randomly in order to iso-
late the the effect of teacher selection, any of the active
query selection methods from previous work could be
used here. The teacher is selected and then queried using
one of the various methods and the belief distribution
is updated based on the preference of that teacher. The
same ùúëvectors are used for each method, so that the
only difference between the methods is the selection of ùõΩ.
This procedure is repeated 100 times, each time sampling
a new true weight vector wtrue.
Overall, we observe that the active teacher selectionFigure 3: Active teacher selection improves reward inference.
These plots show the expected mean squared error and ex-
pected log loss over the course of 100 iterations of reward infer-
ence using various teacher selection methods. The solid line is
the mean, and the shading is the standard deviation. Selecting
teacher ùõΩw.r.t. mean square error most effectively minimizes
mean square error, while selecting ùõΩw.r.t. log loss most ef-
fectively minimizes log loss. In both cases, selecting teachers
according to Equation 8 clearly outperforms the heuristic of
always selecting the most rational teacher (largest ùõΩ) and the
baselines (random ùõΩandùõΩ= 1).
methods (MSE and LL) outperform the baseline methods.
Moreover, we examine how the most informative value
ofùõΩchanges with additional queries in Figure 4. As
expected, the optimal ùõΩvalue decreases with additional
queries, as the distribution gets less broad. At beginning
of training, our approach queries the teachers with large
ùõΩvalues because this enables it to determine the sign of
w‚ä§ùúôùëñùëó, and then our approach queries the teachers with
smaller ùõΩvalues to determine the magnitude of w‚ä§ùúôùëñùëó
as it gets more information.
8. Limitations and Future Work
For the sake of conceptual clarity and mathematical for-
malism, we have used relatively simple human decision-
making and reward models. Future work should extend
these results by increasing model complexity.
For example, this analysis assumes that humans
are Boltzmann-rational decision-makers with constant,
known ùõΩvalues. While more nuanced than optimal mod-
els, Boltzmann-rational models fail to account for system-
atic biases in human judgement [ 28,39,40]. This work
could be improved by using more complex, realistic mod-
Figure 4: This plot shows the most informative values of ùõΩ
during training, averaged across 100 runs (given the expected
mean squared error and expected log loss respectively). The
solid line is the mean and the shaded area is the standard
deviation. ùõΩdecreases over the course of training, as the
learner‚Äôs belief distribution over wbecomes more confident.
els of human decision-making, for example by allowing
each human‚Äôs ùõΩparameter to vary across the state space
to capture teacher specialization or by measuring and ex-
plicitly modeling systematic cognitive biases. Moreover,
this analysis assumes that the teacher ùõΩparameters are
given, whereas in reality the agent may not have access
to this information. Future work should also examine
ways of modeling this part of human decision-making
alongside learning the reward function.
Finally, future work could extend these results to non-
linear reward models, such as ensembles of neural net-
works. Moreover, it could explore convergence proper-
ties and optimal querying strategies for learning from
teachers with different reward functions. For example,
variations in individual taste might lead teachers to dis-
agree on which restaurants are best. Future work should
explore the ramifications of such inter-teacher variance
on teacher selection and reward learning.
9. Conclusion
In this work, we motivated, specified, and evaluated an
algorithm for selecting which teacher to query during
active reward learning with multiple teachers. Our algo-
rithm models the teachers as Boltzmann-rational with
known ùõΩparameters. At each time step, it queries the
teacher that will be most informative in expectation. In-
terestingly, we find that the most informative teacher is
not always the most rational one. We prove and demon-
strate that the reward learner‚Äôs belief will eventually
collapse to the true reward function under our algorithm.
Our hope is that this method and analysis will improve
reward learning in domains where feedback is gathered
from multiple teachers with varying levels of rationality.Acknowledgments
