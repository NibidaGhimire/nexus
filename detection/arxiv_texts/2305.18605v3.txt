Turbidity Control in Sedimentation Columns by
Direction Dependent Models
Jesus-Pablo Toledo-Zucco, Daniel Sbarbaro, Jo ˜ao Manoel Gomes da Silva Jr.
Abstract —. Sedimentation is a crucial phenomenon in recov-
ering water from slurries by separating solid-liquid. Thickeners
and sedimentation columns are equipments widely used in the
process industry to reclaim water from process slurries. This
contribution addresses the problem of controlling the turbidity
of the recovered water in a sedimentation column by manipulat-
ing the underflow. The phenomenological model describing the
turbidity is too complex to be used in a control strategy, and it
is difficult to identify its parameters using plant measurements.
This work proposes an empirical piece-wise time-delay model for
modeling the turbidity at the top of the column to circumvent
these problems. A systematic design procedure is developed to
tune a Proportional Integral controller guaranteeing closed-loop
stability for systems modeled as a piece-wise time delay model.
Experiments in a pilot plant validate the theoretical results and
illustrate the control performance under various operational
scenarios.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Reducing fresh water consumption is a major goal in the
mining industry to ensure sustainability. Solid-liquid separa-
tion plays a key role in all the water recovering processes
[1]. The water can be recovered from the mining slurry using
a sedimentation process. In this context, it is fundamental to
control the turbidity of the water recovered for its reuse in
the process. As pointed out in [2] and [3], it is challenging to
stabilize this control loop, and therefore a simple mass balance
controller has been proposed instead. Still, these strategies
require an estimation of the solid inventory.
The sedimentation process can be modeled using con-
servation laws leading to a model described by nonlinear
partial differential equations [1][4][5]. This complex model
can not be used in a control strategy, and its parameters
are not easily identified using operational data. Tan et al.
[6] proposed a Kalman filter to identify key sedimentation
parameters of the solid material in the slurry. They used this
information to tune a model predictive control based on a
linearized model. This work, however, proposes an empirical
representation to model the turbidity at some specific height
of the sedimentation equipment. In particular, since the solid-
liquid separation process exhibits some direction-dependent

finite-dimensional models that are piece-wise depending on the
direction of the variables. The main complexity of the linear
piece-wise model considered in this work is that the input
delay is also switching on time.
Direction-dependent systems can be found in many in-
dustrial processes such as heating or cooling and chemical
ones, among others [7][8][9]. These type of systems can be
regarded as a special type of linear switching systems; where
the switching function is defined by the process itself. Gain-
scheduled PID control with two sets of parameters has been
proposed to control this type of process, along with auto-
tuning methods [10][11][12][13]. Although these design ap-
proaches have proven to be effective, the closed-loop stability
of the switched system has not been systematically addressed.
On the other hand, most standard industrial PID controller
blocks do not offer the capability to adjust the controller
parameters based on external measurements. Tuning a PID
controller in this scenario is typically performed by consider-
ing worst-case conditions. Therefore, the goal of this work is to
propose a systematic approach to ensure closed-loop stability
and achieve a consistent level of performance with a single
tuning parameter. This approach explicitly takes into account
directional-dependent dynamics (i.e., a switching behavior)
and ensures a specific level of performance, expressed in terms
of a guaranteed quadratic cost.
The stability of linear switching system not only depends
on the structure and the parameters of the different modes, but
also on the switching function. The necessary and sufficient
conditions for asymptotic stability of systems with arbitrary
switching are surveyed in [14]. The analysis is centered in
finding a Common Quadratic Lyapunov Function (CQLF)
for establishing the closed loop stability [15]. The use of a
CQLF in the context of control design for switched linear
systems have been addressed by several authors. For instance,
in [16] a method to design dynamic controllers for continuous
time switched linear system is provided. In [17] the problem
of designing a switching signal for exponential stabilization
of a discrete-time switched system with time-varying delay
is addressed. By applying a Common Lyapunov-Krasovskii
Functional (CLKF), sufficient conditions to guarantee the
global exponential stability of the closed loop system are
obtained. It is important to notice that these results can not
directly be applied to the proposed sedimentation model, since
its time delay is direction dependent. In order to address this
problem, in our previous work [18], a simple transformation
was proposed in order to define a CLKF. The Lyapunov-
Krasovskii candidate function is similar to the one proposed
in [19] and [20]. Based on this analysis, a tuning method-arXiv:2305.18605v3  [eess.SY]  1 Jul 20242
ology for a PI controller guaranteeing closed-loop stability
was proposed. In this contribution, the theoretical results
are summarized for sake of completeness and applied to a
sedimentation pilot plant to shade light on their applicability
to real systems.
The paper is organized as follow. Sections II describes the
characteristics of the sedimentation column. In section III, the
identification of an empirical model is addressed. Section IV
derives the necessary conditions for closed-loop stability and
section V proposes a tuning strategy for a PI controller. Section
VI illustrates the application of the proposed methodology, and
presents the experimental results obtained in a sedimentation
column. Finally, section VII summarizes the main conclusions.
II. D ESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM
The experimental setup shown in Figure 1 was built for
testing modelling and control strategies under wide range of
operational conditions [21] [22]. The sedimentation column is
2.5mheight and has a 0.5m2cross-section surface. In figure
1 a), the frontal side of the sedimentation column in a normal
operation shows two different zones:
i. Zone 1: Clarification zone at the top part of the sedimen-
tation column.
ii. Zone 2: Thickening zone at the bottom part.
Zone 1 has a small amount of solid particles compared to Zone
2. The objective is to keep a certain overflow at the top of the
column with a fixed water turbidity. The recovered water is
stored in a container for re-utilization. As seen in Figure 1
c), a second tank with a mixer is used to store the slurry
and to pump it to the sedimentation column. Two pumps are
used to control the feed and discharge flows. Both pumps are
commanded by variable frequency drives. They are located
under the column, as seen in 1 c). Note that, having an input
flow greater than the output one, an overflow can be generated
at the top of the sedimentation column. Finally, at Zone 1 a
turbidity sensor measures the turbidity of the overflow (see
Figure 1 a) and the scheme of Figure 1 b)).
The main variables of the experimental set-up are the
frequencies of the feed pump drives for the feed flow ui
k,
and discharge flow uo
k, and the turbidity at the top of the
column yk(see Figure 1 b)). Variable krepresents the sample
at time t=kT, with Tdenoting the sampling time of the
controller. All the instrumentation is connected to an Allen
Bradley Control Logic PLC. We define the control input
asuk=ui
k−uo
k. In the following section, we propose
an empirical piece-wise time-delay model for modelling the
turbidity ykas a function of the control input uk.
III. E MPIRICAL MODEL
The model is identified using the measured data of the
turbidity when perturbing the column with step changes. As
seen in Figure 2, for a step inputs the output behaves as a first
order system with the following characteristics:
i. The dynamic of ykbehaves with different time constants,
when ukis increasing ( ∆uk:=uk−uk−1>0) than
when it is decreasing ( ∆uk<0).

the process, and (c) Lateral view of the set up.
ii. The delay is different when ukis increasing ( ∆uk>0)
than when it is decreasing ( ∆uk<0).
iii. The output ykhas a saturation limit.
For simplicity, we consider that the measured turbidity does
not reach the saturation limit. Hence it can be modeled as a
piece-wise or direction dependent system [9]. The dynamic
model writes
xk+1=aσxk+bσuk−dσ+cσ,
yk=xk(1)3

also direction dependant. Several open-loop experiments were
carried out to gather information of the process dynamics. The
parameters are obtained by solving a least square optimization
problem. Figure 3 shows the process and model responses
using a validation data set with a sampling period Ts= 1s.
The identified parameters are summarized in Table I.

In the following, we propose systematic design procedure
to tune a PI controller so that the closed-loop stability is
guaranteed.
IV. C ONTROLLER DESIGN
The design of a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller for the
system (1) such that the closed-loop system is asymptotically
stable was proposed in [18]. This approach finds a region for
the controller parameters in which the closed-loop stability is
guaranteed and then selects a single pair of values to minimize
the settling time of xk. The controller gains are designed
by means of an iterative solution of a set of Linear Matrix
Inequalities (LMIs). In Fig. 4, we show the block diagram of
the closed-loop system, consisting of a classic output feedback
yk, compared to the reference signal rk, passing through a
PI controller and obtaining the control signal uk. Finally, the
frequency of the output pump drive uo
kis obtained subtractingthe frequency of the input pump drive ui
kfrom the control
signal, i.e.,uo
k=ui
k−uk.
Fig. 4: Block diagram of the closed-loop system.
For the system (1), we define the the reference signal rk,
the error ek=rk−yk, and the PI controller:
uk=kpek+kiik, i k:=k−1X
j=0ej, (3)
in which kp∈Randki∈Rare the proportional and integral
gains, respectively.
In the following, two propositions summarize the main
theoretical results of this paper. Using these results, one can
verify if a pair (kp, ki)∈R2is able to stabilize the system
(1) and search for the pair (kp, ki)that minimizes a quadratic
cost function related to the settling time of the turbidity. In the
following, since the bias terms c1andc2are compensated by
the integral action of the controller in both operational modes,
we omit them for the stability analysis in order to simplify
the explanation of the following propositions. Without loss of
generality we also consider a null reference signal rk= 0 for
allk.

loop system (1) and the control law (3):

The closed-loop system (1)-(3) is asymptotically stable if
there exist 4×4matrices P1>04,S1>04,S2>04,W1,
W2,W3,M1,M2,P2, and P3such that the following LMIs

Proof. See Appendix A.
Remark 1: TheIinotation refers to the identity matrix of
sizei, the 0ito a null square matrix of size i, and 0i×jto a
null matrix of irows and jcolumns.
Remark 2: With the previous proposition one can find a
region Ω1, such that (kp, ki)∈Ω1⊂R2assures the closed-
loop stability. This region can be found by iteratively solving
the LMI (6) for a mesh grid of pairs (kp, ki). Since d2= 1,
the unknown matrices of the LMI are of size 4×4. Ifd2is
bigger, then the unknown matrices are of bigger size as well.
Remark 3: The conditions in (6) are obtained to guarantee
stability of both models with a common Lyapunov-Krasovskii
functional. The inequality Λ<0guarantees the stability when
σ= 1. We use the Moon’s inequality [19], which lead to the
forth LMI in (6) (see (22) in the proposition proof in Appendix
A). The inequalities eA⊤
2P1eA2−P1<0andΛ2<0guarantees
closed-loop stability when σ= 2 (see the derivation of (24)
in Appendix A).
For design purposes, the LMIs in (6) are slightly modified in
such a way that the closed-loop system remains asymptotically
stable and minimizes the following cost function:
J=∞X
k=0zT
kQzk, with z k=
xk

, (7)
where Q∈R4×4is a design matrix that can weight the current
state ( xk), the current integral action ( −ik) and the delayed
ones by the smallest delay d2, which in this case is unitary.
Proposition 2: Consider the same conditions and matrices
than in Proposition 1. Replace the LMIs in (6) by the follow-
ing:
Λ<−Q,

2P1eA2−P1<−Q, Λ2<04,

with 04≤Q=QT∈R4×4andQ∈R12×12. If we select
(kp, ki)such that (8) is satisfied and the trace of the matrix
P1+hS2is minimum, then a minimized guaranteed cost is
obtained, that is J < z⊤
0(P1+hS2)z0, considering that zk=
z0,∀k∈[−h,0].
Proof. See Appendix B.Remark 4: The minimization of the trace of the matrix P1+
hS2can be solved iteratively by evaluating the trace of P1+
hS2at every pair (kp, ki)∈Ω1. A simple choice of Qcan be a
diagonal matrix with the two first diagonal terms weighing the
plant state ( i.e., the output ) and the integral term, respectively.
Remark 5: A gain-scheduling control approach can be used
to optimize performance in both directions ( σ={1,2}),
potentially yielding superior results compared to those pro-
posed in this article. However, this method requires tuning
four control parameters (a pair of (kp, ki)per model). For the
sake of simplicity, we have opted for a single PI controller
capable of stabilizing the models of both modes.
It should be noted that the LMIs in (6) can also be used to
certify the closed-loop stability if other methods are used to
tune the PI parameters. In the following section, we propose
a brief design procedure to tune the gains of the PI controller
based on the previous results.
V. D ESIGN PROCEDURE
The design procedure can be summarized as follows1
1) Select the ranges kp∈[kp,kp]andki∈[ki,ki].
2) Generate a grid of pairs (kp, ki)inside the selected
ranges.
3) Solve the LMIs in (6) for every pair (kp, ki)on the grid.
If the LMIs have solution, then the pair belongs to Ω1.
4) Chose a desired weight matrix Qand Solve the LMIs
in (8) for every pair (kp, ki)∈Ω1. If the LMIs have
solution, then the pair belongs to Ω2.
5) Select the pair (kp, ki)∈Ω2that minimizes the trace of
the matrix P1+hS2.
The parameters obtained empirically in Table I are used to
design the PI controller following the previous steps. First,
we select [kp,kp] = [0 ,7]and[ki,ki] = [0 ,06]. Second,
we create the grid using a 40values per parameter. Third,
we solve the LMIs in (6) for every pair (kp, ki)on the
grid. If the LMIs have solution we save the pair in the set
Ω1(see Figure 5). Every pair in Ω1guarantees closed-loop
stability. For the fourth step, we show two different designs:
Design 1 with Q=diag(20,20,0,0)and Design 2 with
Q=diag(22,22,0,0). By increasing the values of Q, one
can achieve faster responses, but with bigger overshoots in
the worst case (when σ= 1). Then, we solve the LMIs in (8)
for every pair (kp, ki)∈Ω1. If the LMIs have solution, we
save the pair in the set Ω2(See Figure 5). We can see that
when increasing the diagonal values of Q, the region Ω2gets
reduced. Finally, we select the pair (kp, ki)∈Ω2that leads
to a solution to LMIs in (8) that minimizes the trace of the
matrix P1+hS2.
Remark 6: The upper and lower limits of kpandkican be
obtained using a trial and error strategy. One way to do this
is to start with kp=ki= 0and random values for kpandki,
and solving the LMI (6) in a short mesh. Then, increase or
reduce the values of kpandkiaccordingly. Finally, the mesh

can be chosen more precise in order to extend the choices of
the pairs (kp, ki).
A. Numerical Simulation
The numerical simulation that follows shows the solution
characteristics obtained through the proposed approach in
comparison to a conventional tuning. As we show in Fig. 5,
for the Design 1 we obtain: kp= 2.3333 andki= 0.0072 ,
whereas for the Design 2: kp= 2.6923 andki= 0.0090 .
Additionally, a conventional PI controller has been designed
using the AMIGO tuning rules considering the worst case only
(σ= 1). In this method, the controller gains are obtained as
[23, Section 2.3]
kp=1
K(0.15 + 0 .35τ
θ−τ2
(θ+τ)2),
ki=kp
τi, τ i= (0.35 +6.7τ2
τ2+2θτ+10θ2)θ,
in which K,τandθrepresent respectively the static gain, time
constant, and time delay of a delayed first-order continuous
model. We consider that these model parameters correspond to
the delayed first-order model with the worst delay, i.e.,σ= 1
(see Table I) . In this case, the parameters of the continuous
time model are computed as τ=1
1−a1,K=b1τ, and θ=d1.
Thus, we obtain the following controller parameters: kp=
1.0623 andki= 0.0051 .
The system (1) with parameters summarized in Table I
is simulated with initial conditions x0= 12 [%] . In Fig.
6 and Fig. 7, we show the step responses and the control
signals, respectively. The conventional PI achieves a good
balance between overshoot and settling time for a positive step
response (see step response at t= 5 [min]). However, since
the second mode has not been considered in the design, the
performance of negative step responses (see step response at
t= 25 [ min]) has a large settling time. Using the proposed
approach, one can improve the behaviour of the second mode
by aggravating the behaviour of the first one and always
guaranteeing closed-loop stability. In this example, we can see
that we can reduce the settling time for negative step responses
in exchange for increasing the overshoot of the positive ones.
As we can see in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, using the proposed method,
one can reduce the overshot by modifying the weight matrix
Q(Design 2 has smaller overshoot than Design 1).
VI. E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The controller was tested under set-point changes and step
disturbances in the inflow. Figures 8 and 9, show the turbidity

at the top of the sedimentation column for four operational
points. In the left image of Fig. 8, we show the column with
a very low turbidity at the top ( yk≈1%). This is achieved
by having a bigger outflow (at the bottom of the column) than
the inflow (at the three quarters of the column). However,
under these conditions there is no overflow at the top of
the column for water recycling. Since the objective of this
process is the water recovering, we restring ourselves to bigger
values of turbidity where a small overflow is generated (see
the other three images in Figs 8 and 9) . Using the proposed
PI controller, we can set a desired turbidity and modified in
real time according to water requirements. There is a trade-off
between the amount of water recovered and its turbidity.
Fig. 8: At the left a turbidity yk≈1%and the the right a
turbidity yk≈5%.
The closed-loop piece-wise behaviour for different refer-
ences values of turbidity can be seen in Figure 10. When the
turbidity is increasing the closed-loop system behaves as a
first order system with a constant time about τ≈1 [min]
and a static gain K≈1. When the turbidity is decreasing,
the closed-loop behaviour is slower than when increasing it6

turbidity yk≈20%.
and it has a small overshoot. This is mainly due to the fact
that we use a single controller for stabilizing a plant that
is composed of a piece-wise linear and delayed model that
switches between two different models. As we point it out in
Remark 5, one could consider a gain-scheduling approach in
order to get an improved performance for both models. We
note that the responses depicted in Fig. 10 deviate from the
numerical simulations presented in Fig. 6, primarily due to
unaccounted nonlinearities and the infinite-dimensional nature
of the real phenomena. At approximately 5%turbidity, which
is close to the operation point for which the model has
been identified, one can observe a resemblance between the
experimental and numerical responses: a rapid reaction to a
positive step and a slower reaction to a negative step.

In Fig. 11, we show the control signal uk, and the pump
drive frequencies ui

k(output pump),
where the output one is computed as shown in the block
diagram of Fig. 4. We can see that during the test, the

kremains inside [0,50] [Hz], not
being saturated.
Remark 7: Notice that the noise of the output signal in Fig.
10 (closed-loop system) is slightly bigger than the ones in Fig.
2 and Fig. 3 (open-loop system). This noise amplification may
be induced by the paralell implementation of the PI controller
through the proportional gain. This issue can be potentially
improved by filtering the output signal before introducing it
to the controller or considering a cascade implementation of
the PI controller.

Finally, Figure 12 shows the output rejection to a perturba-
tion. In this case, the perturbation is the input flow. We can see
that the turbidity remains close to the desired value ( yk≈9)
and as soon as the input flow increases, the variations of the
input and output are bigger. Due to the high input flow, there
are more particles of the mixture going to the upper zone of
the column, implying variations on the turbidity measurements
and thus, requiring more efforts for the control input. However,
as we can see in Figure 12, for a constant perturbation, the
variations are non increasing and the input and output remain
bounded.

disturbance ui

Remark 8: Notice that the controller is tuned using an
empirical affine piece-wise model with delay. This means that
stability and performances are locally with respect to some
nonlinear model describing the system. This implies that as
soon as the variables move away from the linearisation point,
the performances differ from the desired ones and can turn the
closed-loop unstable. For instance, in Fig. 12, we can see that
as soon as the perturbation signal increases, the closed-loop
system becomes less damped.
VII. C ONCLUSION
We have proposed a simple empirical model to describe the
turbidity dynamics at the top of a sedimentation column as a
piece-wise time-delay linear model considering the input and
output flows. The experimental results show that this model
can adequately represents the dynamic of the process. In this
model, all the plant parameters, including the time delay,
switch between two modes. Due to the delay dependency
on the switching function, we have provided sufficient condi-
tions to guarantee closed-loop stability based on a Lyapunov-
Krasovskii functional. A systematic tuning methodology for
linear PI controller was proposed and validated in a pilot
plant. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the7
proposed approach to regulate the turbidity under a wide
range of operational conditions. The proposed approach can be
extended to formally deal with uncertainties, control saturation
and anti-windup issues [24].

APPENDIX
A. Proof of Proposition 1
The proof is generalized for the cases in which d2≥1. We
consider a null reference ( i.e.,rk= 0 for all k) and since the values
c1andc2do not affect closed-loop stability, for simplicity we omit
them. For the closed-loop system (1)-(3), we define the augmented
state and output vectors xa
k∈R2andya
k∈R2respectively as:
xa
k=xkPk−1
i=0xi
, ya
k=ykPk−1
i=0yi
. (9)
Note that, since yk=xk, the augmented vectors preserve the equality
ya
k=xa
k. Then, the augmented system is written as
xa
k+1=Aσxa
k+Bσuk−dσ, ya
k=C xa
k, (10)
and the PI controller as:
uk=−Kcya
k, K c= kpki
. (11)
Since (10) has different delays d1andd2, we select the smallest one
(d2is considered the smallest one). Then, we define h:=d1−d2
and the closed-loop state vector as:
zk= 
(xa
k)⊤(xa
k−1)⊤··· (xa
k−d2)⊤⊤. (12)
Note that, in the considered process of this paper (with d2= 1, the
closed-loop state vector is of size 4). Then, the closed-loop system
(10)-(11) can be written as zk+1=fσ(zk, zk−h)with:
f1(zk, zk−h) =eA1zk+Ap(zk−zk−h)
f2(zk) =eA2zk(13)

withi={1,2}. Note that, for the case of d2= 1, the matrices eA1,
eA2, andeAp=−Apare equivalently represented in Proposition 1.
Similar to [25], we use a common candidate Lyapunov-Krasovskii
function defined as:
Vk=V1
k+V2
k+V3
k, V1
k=zT
kP1zk,
V2
k=0X

withwk=zk+1−zkand matrices
P1=PT
1>0, S 1=ST
1>0, S 2=ST
2>0. (15)
We show that the CLKF is decreasing in both conditions ( σ= 1 and
σ= 2). The difference equation ∆Vkwrites:
∆Vk=Vk+1−Vk= ∆V1
k+ ∆V2
k+ ∆V3
k. (16)
In the following, we find necessary conditions to guarantee ∆Vk<0
for both conditions.
1) Conditions for σ= 1:Analyzing each term

which can be expressed as ∆Vk≤zT

and the matrix Λdefined in the
statement of Proposition 1. Therefore, if
Λ<0, (23)then∆Vk<0.

Note that, for σ= 2 the dynamic is given by zk+1=eA2zk
and thus wk= (eA2−I)zk. Then, the second term of the
Lyapunov difference equation can be written as:
∆V2

with ˜S1= (eA2−I)TS1(eA2−I). Similarly the ∆V3
kterm is
written in terms of the delayed variable zk−has follows:
∆V3
k=zT
kS2zk−zT
k−hS2zk−h,
=zT
k−h(eAT

Finally, if ∆V1
k<0and∆V2
k+ ∆V3
k<0, one can guarantee
∆Vk<0. This leads respectively to the following LMI
conditions:

Summarizing, the stability of the closed-loop system is
stablished if there exist matrices P1,P2,P3,S1,S2,W1,W2,
W3,M1andM2such that LMIs (15), (22), (23), (24) are
satisfied.
B. Proof of Proposition 2
If the LMI (8) is satisfied, then for both σ= 1 andσ= 2
the variation of the CLKF is given by ∆Vk=Vk+1−Vk<
−zT
kQzk. By adding at both sides from k= 0 tok=∞, one
can rebuild the cost function Jin (7) asP∞
i=0(Vi+1−Vi)<
−P∞
i=0zT
iQzi=−J. Then, by computing the right hand
side and re-organizing terms we obtain J < V 0−V∞.Since
the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable (Proposition
1),V∞= 0. Then, considering that zk=z0,∀k∈[−h,0],
and evaluating V0in (14), we obtain the following bound for
the cost function
J < V 0=zT
0(P1+hS2)z0. (25)
Finally, the minimization of Jin (7) is equivalent to the
minimization of the maximum eigenvalue of P1+hS2.
