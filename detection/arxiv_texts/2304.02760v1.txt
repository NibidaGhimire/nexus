Abstract — Differential drive robots that can be modeled as
a kinematic unicycle are a standard mobile base platform for
many service and logistics robots. Safe and smooth autonomo us
motion around obstacles is a crucial skill for unicycle robo ts
to perform diverse tasks in complex environments. A classic al
control approach for unicycle control is feedback lineariz ation
using a headway point at a ﬁxed headway distance in front of
the unicycle. The unicycle headway control brings the headw ay
point to a desired goal location by embedding a linear headwa y
reference dynamics, which often results in an undesired off set
for the actual unicycle position. In this paper, we introduc e
a new unicycle headway control approach with an adaptive
headway distance that overcomes this limitation, i.e., whe n
the headway point reaches the goal the unicycle position is
also at the goal. By systematically analyzing the closed-lo op
unicycle motion under the adaptive headway controller, we
design analytical feedback motion prediction methods that
bound the closed-loop unicycle position trajectory and so c an be
effectively used for safety assessment and safe unicycle mo tion
design around obstacles. We present an application of adapt ive
headway motion control and motion prediction for safe unicy cle
path following around obstacles in numerical simulations.
I. I NTRODUCTION
Autonomous mobile robots offer ﬂexible automation so-
lutions for many real-life challenges, from assisting peop le
with daily activities (e.g., service robots [1]) to enhanci ng
transportation systems (e.g., warehouse robots [2]). A sta n-
dard choice of a mobile robot base for many such indoor
application settings is differential drive robots that can be
modeled as a kinematic unicycle [3]. Safe and smooth control
of unicycle robots is essential to autonomously and reliabl y
complete different tasks around obstacles [4]. Accurate ro bot
motion prediction is a key enabler for safe unicycle motion
design in complex environments [5]–[9].
In this paper, we introduce a new unicycle headway con-
troller that uses an adaptive headway distance to asymptoti -
cally bring both the headway point and the unicycle position
to any given goal position. For the safety assessment of the
close-loop unicycle motion, we propose analytic (circular and
triangular) feedback motion prediction methods to accurat ely
bound the closed-loop unicycle motion trajectory under the
adaptive headway controller, as illustrated in Fig. 2. We ap ply
the proposed unicycle adaptive headway motion control and
motion prediction for safe path following around obstacles .

A. Motivation and Relevant Literature
Safe autonomous robot motion design requires an accu-
rate understanding and description of the closed-loop robo t
motion under a feedback motion controller. Existing contro l
approaches for widely used unicycle mobile robots mainly
focus on the stability and convergence of closed-loop unicy -
cle motion [10]–[14], but pay little attention to the geomet ric
properties of the resulting robot motion, which is essentia l for
safety [8], [15]. A classical feedback linearization appro ach
for unicycle control is based on the use of a headway (a.k.a.
offset) point that is at a ﬁxed headway distance in front
of the unicycle and is smoothly steered towards a desired
goal by embedding some linear headway reference dynamics
[13], [14], [16]–[20]. However, the use of a ﬁxed headway
distance causes a nonzero steady-state error for the unicyc le
position since the unicycle robot stops at a headway distanc e
away from the goal while the headway point approaches the
goal location. In this paper, we propose a unicycle adaptive
headway controller based on an adaptive headway distance
that asymptotically decreases to zero as the headway point
converges to the goal location, which also ensures that the
unicycle reaches the goal.
Motion prediction for anticipating the future motion of
an autonomous system plays a key role in the safety as-
sessment, control, and planning of mobile robots around
obstacles [21]. Feedback motion prediction, i.e., ﬁnding a
bounding motion set on the closed-loop motion trajectory of
an autonomous mobile robot under a known control policy,
enables informative safety veriﬁcation and assessment too ls
[7]–[9], [22]. Reachability analysis offers computationa l
tools for estimating such motion sets for control systems
[23], [24], but often comes with a high computational cost.For globally convergent autonomous systems, the notion of
forward and backward reachable sets [25] is trivial because
the forward reachable set corresponds to the closed-loop
system trajectory due to the autonomous nature of the
system whereas the backward reachability set is the entire
state space due to the global convergence. In this paper,
by exploiting the linearity properties of headway control,
we propose new analytic (circular and triangular) motion
prediction methods to bound the unicycle robot motion under
the adaptive headway controller. We apply adaptive headway
motion control and motion prediction for safe unicycle path
following around obstacles and compare the performance of
the circular and triangular motion prediction methods with
the forward simulation of the closed-loop unicycle dynamic s.
B. Contributions and Organization of the Paper
This paper introduces new adaptive headway motion con-
trol and motion prediction methods for safe unicycle motion
design around obstacles. In Section II, we present our adap-
tive headway control approach that asymptotically brings t he
kinematic unicycle model to a desired goal position by using
an adaptive headway distance that depends on the unicycle
distance to the goal. As opposed to a ﬁxed headway distance,
our use of an adaptive headway distance allows for both the
headway point and the unicycle position to asymptotically
reach the goal position. In Section III, based on a systemati c
and careful analysis of the closed-loop unicycle motion,
we design two analytical (circular and triangular) feedbac k
motion prediction methods to bound the closed-loop unicycl e
motion trajectory of the kinematic unicycle model under
the adaptive headway control. In Section IV, we present
an example application of the adaptive headway motion
control and motion prediction for safe path following aroun d
obstacles in numerical simulations. We conclude in Section
V with a summary of our contributions and future directions.
II. U NICYCLE ADAPTIVE HEADWAY CONTROL
In this section, we brieﬂy describe the standard headway
control approach for feedback linearization of the kinemat ic
unicycle robot model, and then present a new unicycle
headway control approach with an adaptive headway distance
to reach a given goal location. We highlight important geo-
metric properties of the proposed unicycle adaptive headwa y
controller to understand the resulting unicycle robot moti on.
A. Kinematic Unicycle Robot Model
In the Euclidean plane R2, we consider a kinematic
unicycle robot whose state is represented by its position
x∈R2and forward orientation angle θ∈[−π,π)that is
measured in radians counterclockwise from the horizontal
axis. The equations of motion of the kinematic unicycle robo t
model are given by
˙ x =v/bracketleftbigg
cosθ
sinθ/bracketrightbigg
and˙θ=ω (1)
wherev∈Randω∈Rare the scalar control inputs,
respectively, specifying the linear and angular velocity o fthe unicycle robot. Hence, by deﬁnition, the unicycle robot
model is underactuated (i.e., three state variables, but on ly
two control inputs) and has the nonholonomic motion con-
straint of no sideway motion, i.e.,/bracketleftbigg−sinθ
cosθ/bracketrightbiggT
˙ x = 0 .
B. Unicycle Headway Motion Control
A standard feedback linearization approach for unicycle
control [14], [20], [26] is the use of a headway (a.k.a. offse t)
point, denoted by xε∈R2, that is at a certain (e.g., ﬁxed or
varying) headway distance ε≥0in front of the robot as
xε:= x+ε/bracketleftbiggcosθ
sinθ/bracketrightbigg
(2)
so that the nonholonomic unicycle dynamics can be con-
trolled by embedding some desired (e.g., ﬁrst-order linear )
reference dynamics for the headway point. Under the unicy-
cle dynamics in (1), the headway point evolves as
˙ xε= (v+ ˙ε)/bracketleftbigg
cosθ
sinθ/bracketrightbigg
+ω ε/bracketleftbigg
−sinθ
cosθ/bracketrightbigg
(3a)
=/bracketleftbiggcosθ−εsinθ
sinθ εcosθ/bracketrightbigg/bracketleftbiggv+ ˙ε
ω/bracketrightbigg
. (3b)
Hence, given a desired reference headway velocity proﬁle
˙ xεand a desired headway distance function ε, the linear and
angular velocity control inputs for a unicycle robot can be
determined for ε/\egatio\slash= 0 as
/bracketleftbigg
v
ω/bracketrightbigg
=/bracketleftbiggcosθsinθ
−sinθ
εcosθ
ε/bracketrightbigg
˙ xε−/bracketleftbigg
˙ε
0/bracketrightbigg
. (4)
For example, a classical choice of reference dynamics for
the headway point uses the ﬁrst-order proportional error
feedback to move the headway point xεtowards a given
goal position x∗∈R2as [14], [20], [26]
˙ xε=−κr(xε−x∗) (5)
whereκr>0is a scalar positive control gain; and as a
headway distance, the existing literature on unicycle head -
way motion control [14], [20], [26] mainly assumes a ﬁxed
positive headway distance (i.e., ε >0and˙ε= 0), which
results in the following standard unicycle headway control ler

that asymptotically brings the headway point to the goal but
leaves the robot at a headway distance away from the goal.
C. Unicycle Control with Adaptive Headway Distance
In order to exactly move the unicycle robot to the goal
position using the headway control approach, we consider an
adaptive headway distance based on the Euclidean distance
of the unicycle position to the goal position as
ε:=κε/bardblx−x∗/bardbl, (7)whereκε>0is a ﬁxed scalar coefﬁcient. Under the unicycle
dynamics in (1), the time rate of change of the headway
distanceεin (7) is given by
˙ε=κεv/bracketleftbiggcosθ
sinθ/bracketrightbiggT(x−x∗)
/bardblx−x∗/bardbl(8)
for anyx/\egatio\slash= x∗, which depends on the linear velocity
inputv. Therefore, using the general form of the unicycle
headway control in (4), the ﬁrst-order headway reference
dynamics in (5), the adaptive headway distance in (7),
and the headway distance dynamics in (8), we design an
unicycle adaptive headway motion controller , denoted by
ux∗(x,θ) = (vx∗(x,θ),ωx∗(x,θ)), that determines the linear
velocityvx∗(x,θ)and the angular velocity ωx∗(x,θ)for the
unicycle model in (1) as1

/bardblx∗−x/bardbl(9b)
whereκr>0and1> κε>0. Here, it is important
to remark that the unity upper bound on κεis not only
a sufﬁcient but also a necessary condition to avoid the
singularity in the linear velocity control in (9a) and also
to ensure the global convergence of our unicycle adaptive
headway controller (see Proposition 1).
The major signiﬁcance of the adaptive headway distance
in (7) over a ﬁxed headway distance is that being at the goal
is the same for both the headway point and the unicycle
position.
Lemma 1 (Being at the Goal) Regardless of the unicycle
orientation θ∈[π,π), the unicycle position xis at the goal
x∗if and only if the headway point xεassociated with the
adaptive headway distance εin (7) is at the goal x∗, i.e.,
x=x∗⇐⇒xε=x∗∀θ∈[−π,π). (10)
Proof. See Appendix I-A. /squaresolid
Hence, as the headway point is asymptotically approaching
the goal location, the unicycle robot also reaches the goal
under the adaptive headway controller.
Proposition 1 (Global Convergence) The unicycle adaptive
headway motion controller ux∗in (9) asymptotically brings
all initial unicycle states (x,θ)inR2×[−π,π)to any
given goal position x∗∈R2, that is to say, the closed-loop
trajectory (x(t),θ(t))of the unicycle dynamics in (1) under
the adaptive headway controller in (9) satisﬁes
lim
t→∞x(t) = x∗. (11)
1Note that we set v= 0 andω= 0 when the unicycle is at the goal
(i.e.,x = x∗) to resolve the indeterminacy. This naturally introduces a
discontinuity in control at the goal position as necessitat ed by Brockett’s
theorem [27]. Otherwise, the unicycle adaptive headway mot ion control in
(9) is locally Lipshitz continuous everywhere, away from th e goal position.Proof. By construction, the unicycle adaptive headway dis-
tance control policy in (9) realizes the ﬁrst-order headway -
point reference dynamics in (5). The headway point xεunder
the reference dynamics in (5) asymptotically reaches the go al
position since the squared Euclidean distance of the headwa y
pointxε(x,θ)to the goal decreases over time as
d
dt/bardblxε−x∗/bardbl2=−2κr/bardblxε−x∗/bardbl2≤0. (12)
Therefore, we also have the global convergence of the
unicycle position to the goal position since being at the goa l
is the same for both the headway point and the unicycle
position (Lemma 1), i.e., x = x∗⇐⇒xε= x∗, due to the
speciﬁc form of the adaptive headway distance in (7) /squaresolid
D. Geometric Properties of Adaptive Headway Controller
In this part, we present some important geometric proper-
ties of the unicycle robot motion under the adaptive headway
controller that form the basis for the unicycle feedback
motion prediction later in Section III. Since the headway
pointxεmoves along a straight line segment towards the
goalx∗under the headway reference dynamics in (5), it is
convenient to deﬁne the tangent vector tεand the normal
vectornεof the motion of the headway point as
tε:=

x∗−xε
/bardblx∗−xε/bardbl, ifxε/\egatio\slash= x∗

whereRφ:=/bracketleftbigg

sinφcosφ/bracketrightbigg
denotes the 2D rotation
matrix with an angle of φ. Observe that both the tangent
tεand the normal nεare constant during the unicycle
motion under the adaptive headway controller away from
the goal. We also deﬁne the projected robot position
/hatwide
xand
the extended robot position /hatwidexwith respect to the motion of
the headway point as/hatwide
x := x∗+tεtεT(x−x∗) (14a)

/bardbl/hatwidex−x∗/bardbl=1/radicalbig

A critical property of the projected and extended unicycle
positions is that they bound the actual unicycle position.

Lemma 3 (Unicycle Distance-to-Goal Bound) For any uni-
cycle state (x,θ)∈R2×[−π,π), the Euclidean distance
/bardblx−x∗/bardblof the unicycle position to the goal position x∗is
bounded below and above by the distances of the projected

/hatwide
xand/hatwidex, to the goal as
/bardbl
/hatwide
x−x∗/bardbl ≤ /bardblx−x∗/bardbl ≤ /bardbl/hatwidex−x∗/bardbl. (17)
Proof. See Appendix I-C. /squaresolid
Due to their strong geometric relation with the unicycle
position in Lemma 2 and Lemma 3, it is important to un-
derstand how the projected and extended unicycle positions
change under the adaptive headway controller in order to
understand the closed-loop unicycle motion.
Lemma 4 (Motion of Projected/Extended Unicycle Posi-
tions) For any unicycle state (x,θ)∈R2×[−π,π), the pro-
jected unicycle position

Finally, as summarized below, two important geometric
features of the unicycle adaptive headway controller relat ed
to the unicycle orientation are continuous goal alignment a nd
goal-aligned forward unicycle motion.
Lemma 5 (Goal Alignment) At any unicycle state (x,θ)∈
R2×[−π,π)away from the goal position x∗∈R2(i.e.,

III. U NICYCLE FEEDBACK MOTION PREDICTION
FOR ADAPTIVE HEADWAY CONTROL
In this section, we present two (one circular and one
triangular) feedback motion prediction methods, as illust rated
in Fig. 2, for bounding the closed-loop motion trajectory
of the unicycle robot model under the adaptive headway
controller and show that these motion prediction methods
asymptotically shrink to the goal point and has a Lipschitz-
continuous minimum (e.g., collision) distance to any given
(e.g., obstacle) point, which are essential for provably co rrect
and safe robot motion design [8], [22].
A. Circular Unicycle Feedback Motion Prediction
One can use the decaying distance of the (extended)
unicycle position to the goal (Lemma 4 and Lemma 6) in
order to determine the closed-loop unicycle motion range.
Proposition 2 (Circular Unicycle Motion Prediction) Start-
ing att= 0from any initial state (x0,θ0)∈R2×[−π,π), the
unicycle position trajectory x(t)under the adaptive headway
controller ux∗in (9) towards any given goal x∗∈R2is
contained for all future times t≥0in the circular motion
prediction set Mux∗,B(x0,θ0)that is deﬁned as
Mux∗,B(x0,θ0):=

that/bardblx(t)−x∗/bardblis bounded above by /bardbl/hatwidex(t)−x∗/bardbl(Lemma
3) which always decreases under the adaptive headway
controller (Lemma 4). Thus, the result follows. /squaresolidFig. 2. Triangular motion bound (left, red) and triangular m otion prediction

initial linear velocity (i.e., backward motion), (b) Zero i nitial linear velocity
(i.e., transition from backward to forward motion), (c, d) P ositive initial
linear velocity (i.e., forward motion).
An important property of circular unicycle motion pre-
diction is positive inclusiveness, which ensures that a saf ety
assessment based on the distance of feedback motion pre-
diction set to obstacles is consistent for all future times.
Proposition 3 (Positive Inclusion of Circular Motion Pre-
diction) The circular motion prediction set Mux∗,B(x,θ)of
the adaptive headway controller ux∗towards any given goal
positionx∗∈R2is positively inclusive along the resulting
unicycle motion trajectory (x(t),θ(t)), i.e.,
Mux∗,B(x(t),θ(t))⊇Mux∗,B(x(t′),θ(t′))∀t′≥t.(23)
Proof. The results follows from the fact that /bardblx(t)−x∗/bardbl ≤
/bardbl/hatwidex(t)−x∗/bardbl(Lemma 3), and /bardbl/hatwidex(t)−x∗/bardblis decreasing along
the unicycle motion trajectory (Lemma 4), and /bardblx(t)−x∗/bardbl

Proposition 4 (Circular Motion Prediction Radius) The
circular motion prediction set Mux∗,B(x(t),θ(t))asymptot-
ically shrinks to the goal position x∗along the closed-
loop motion trajectory (x(t),θ(t))of the unicycle adaptive
headway controller as its radius asymptotically decays to
zero, i.e.,
lim
t→∞min
x′∈Mux∗,B(x(t),θ(t))/bardblx′−x∗/bardbl= 0. (24)
Proof. The result follows from the fact that both the robot
positionx(t)and the extended robot position /hatwidex(t)asymptot-
ically converge to the goal x∗(Proposition 1 and Lemma 4),
which deﬁne the radius of the circular motion prediction set
in (22). /squaresolid
Proposition 5 (Circular Motion Prediction Distance) For any
unicycle state (x,θ)∈R2×[π,−π)away from the goal
x∗, the minimum distance minx′∈Mux∗,B(x,θ)/bardblx′−z/bardblof the
circular motion prediction set Mux∗,B(x,θ)of the adaptive
headway controller ux∗to any given point z∈R2is a locallyLipschitz continuous function of unicycle position x, unicycle
orientation θand goal position x∗.
Proof. Due to the circular shape of Mux∗,B(x,θ), its mini-
mum distance to a point is determined by its center distance
/bardblx∗−z/bardbland its radius, which is /bardblx−x∗/bardblif/bracketleftbiggcosθ0

Hence,/bardbl/hatwidex−x∗/bardbl=1√

x−x∗/bardbl=/bardblx−x∗/bardbl. Hence,
the radius of Mux∗,B(x,θ)is a continuous selection of
locally Lipschitz continuous functions which is also local ly
Lipschitz [28]. Thus, the result follows. /squaresolid
B. Triangular Motion Range Prediction
Although it has a simple analytical form, the circular
unicycle motion prediction Mux∗,B(x,θ)is conservative in
describing the closed-loop unicycle motion due to its sym-
metric form as illustrated in Fig. 2. To capture unicycle
motion direction more accurately, we introduce a triangula r
unicycle motion prediction that contains the closed-loop
unicycle motion trajectory under adaptive headway control .

R2×[−π,π), the unicycle position trajectory x(t)under the
adaptive headway control ux∗(v,ω)in (9) towards a given
goalx∗∈R2is contained for all future times in a triangular
set as
x(t)∈

operator and xε(0)is the headway point deﬁned in (2), /hatwide
x(0) and/hatwidex(0) are the initial projected and extended unicycle
positions deﬁned in (14a) and (14b), respectively.
Proof. We have from Lemma 2 and Lemma 4 that x(t)∈

/hatwide

/hatwide
x(t)∈[x∗,
/hatwide
x(0)] and/hatwidex(t)∈[x∗,/hatwidex(0)]
for allt≥0. Hence, using the convex combination of
the boundary points, one can bound the unicycle position
trajectory as x(t)∈conv(x∗,
/hatwide
x(0),/hatwidex(0)) for allt≥0.
If/bracketleftbiggcosθ(0)

/bardblx∗−x(t)/bardbl≥κε(Lemma 5) and the
unicycle robot always moves with a nonnegative linear
velocity towards the headway point (Lemma 6). Note that the
headway point satisﬁes xε(t)∈[x∗,xε(0)] due to the refer-
ence headway dynamics in (5). Hence, the unicycle position
trajectory can be bounded as x(t)∈conv(x∗,x(0),xε(0))
since the unicycle velocity ˙ x(t)always points towards theheadway point xε(t)∈conv(x∗,x(0),xε(0)) which leaves
conv(x∗,x(0),xε(0)) positively invariant due to the sub-
tangentiality property on the set boundary [29].
Finally, by deﬁnitions (2), (14a), (14b), we have x∈[

It is also important to observe that xε∈[x,/hatwidexε]and

and the extended unicycle position /hatwidexin (14b) is equal to

Mux∗,T(x(0),θ(0)) is a superset of the triangular bound on
the unicycle position trajectory x(t)in Proposition 7, i.e.,
x(t)∈Mux∗,T(x(0),θ(0)) for allt≥0.
Proposition 6 (Triangular Motion Prediction Radius) The
triangular motion prediction set Mux∗,T(x(t),θ(t))of the

shrinks to the goal point along the resulting unicycle motio n

asymptotically decays to zero, i.e.,

x′∈Mux∗,T(x(t),θ(t))/bardblx′−x∗/bardbl= 0 (29)
Proof. The result follows from the fact that the vertices

asymptotically converge to the goal x∗. /squaresolidProposition 7 (Triangular Motion Prediction Distance) For

Proof. Away from the goal position, the vertex points of

functions of x,θ, andx∗for both the case of/bracketleftbiggcosθ

prediction set Mux∗,T(x,θ)can be expressed as an afﬁne
transformation of a ﬁxed triangle that is a smooth function
ofx,θ, andx∗. Therefore, the distance of Mux∗,T(x,θ)is
locally Lipschitz continuous with respect to x,θ, andx∗
since the minimum set-distance is Lipschitz continuous und er
smooth afﬁne transformations (see Lemma 1 in [8]). /squaresolid
IV. A PPLICATION : SAFE UNICYCLE PATH FOLLOWING
VIAADAPTIVE HEADWAY CONTROL AND MOTION PREDICTION
In this section, we demonstrate an application of the
adaptive headway control in (9) and the associated circular
and triangular feedback motion predictions in (22) and (25)
for safe unicycle path following around obstacles using a
time governor [22]. In brief, a time governor performs an
online time parametrization of a reference path for provabl y
correct and safe path following based on the safety assess-
ment of the predicted robot motion [22], which requires an
asymptotically shrinking motion prediction (see Proposit ion
4 and Proposition 6) with Lipschitz-continuous minimum
distance to any given (e.g., obstacle) point (see Propositi on
5 and Proposition 7).
A. Safe Unicycle Path Following via Time Governors
For ease of exposition, we consider a disk-shaped unicycle
robot of body radius ρ >0, centered at position x∈W
with orientation θ∈[−π,π), that operates in a known static
compact environment W⊆R2which is cluttered with a
collection of obstacles represented by an open set O⊂R2.
Hence, the robot’s free space, denoted by F, of collision-free
unicycle positions is given by
F:=/braceleftbig
x∈W/vextendsingle/vextendsingleB(x,ρ)⊆W\O/bracerightbig
, (30)
whereB(x,ρ) :=/braceleftbig
y∈Rd/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/bardbly−x/bardbl ≤ρ/bracerightbig
is the Euclidean
closed ball centered at xwith radius ρ, and/bardbl./bardbldenotes the
standard Euclidean norm. Suppose p(s):[smin,smax]→Fbe
a Lipschitz-continuous collision-free reference path tha t joins
a pair of collision-free start and goal positions xstart,xgoal∈
Fsuch that p(smin) = xstart,p(smax) = xgoal. Starting at
t= 0from the initial path parameter s(0) =smin, the initial
unicycle position x(0) = x start and some initial unicycle
orientation θ(0)∈[−π,π), we construct a safe unicycle path
following controller with online path time-parametrizati on,
based on the adaptive headway control up(s)in (9) towardsthe path point p(s), as
˙s= min/parenleftbig
κσdistF/parenleftbig
Mup(s)(x,θ)/parenrightbig
,−κs(s−smax)/parenrightbig
(31a)
˙ x =vp(s)(x,θ) (31b)
˙θ=ωp(s)(x,θ) (31c)
whereκσ,κs>0are ﬁxed positive control coefﬁcients,
and the safety of the unicycle motion is measured by the
minimum distance between a (e.g., circular or triangular)
feedback motion prediction set Mup(s)(x,θ)of the adaptive
headway controller up(s)and the free space boundary ∂Fas
distF(Mup(s)(x,θ)):=

min
a∈Mup(s)(x,θ)
b∈∂F/bardbla−b/bardbl, ifMup(s)(x,θ)⊆F
0 , otherwise.
(32)
In summary, based on the safety level of the predicted
unicycle robot motion, the path parameter sis continuously
increased in (31) while the unicycle robot under adaptive
headway control up(s)moves towards the reference path
pointp(s)which acts as a local goal. If the reference path
phas a nonzero clearance from the free space boundary
∂F, an asymptotically shrinking feedback motion prediction
with a Lipschitz continuous safety distance (32) ensures th at
the path parameter trajectory s(t)and the unicycle posi-
tion trajectory x(t)under the time-governed path following
dynamics in (31) asymptotically converge to the end of
the reference path with no collision between the robot and
obstacles along the way [22], i.e.,
x(t)∈F∀t≥0
lim
t→∞s(t) =smax
lim
t→∞x(t) = p(smax).
B. Numerical Simulations
In this part, we provide numerical simulations3to demon-
strate safe unicycle path following based on adaptive head-
way control and associated circular and triangular feedbac k
motion prediction methods in an ofﬁce-like environment
illustrated in Fig. 3. As a baseline ground-truth motion
prediction, we use the forward simulation of the adaptive
headway motion control assuming the reference path point
is kept ﬁxed. In Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we illustrate the result-
ing unicycle position trajectories and speed proﬁles durin g
safe unicycle path following using circular, triangular, a nd
forward-simulation-based motion predictions. The result ing
unicycle motion signiﬁcantly differs in terms of the unicyc le
speed and travel time, see Fig. 4, depending on the accuracy
of feedback motion prediction. As expected, forward simu-
lation performs the best in terms of average speed and travel
3For all simulations, we set the headway distance coefﬁcient κε=0.5,
the control coefﬁcient for the headway reference dynamics κr= 1, and
the control coefﬁcients for the time governor in (31) κs= 4,κσ= 4.
We use the arc-length parametrization of a given reference p athp(s)
such that the reference path length Ldetermines the path parameter range
as[smin,smax] = [0,L]. All simulations are obtained by numerically
solving the time-governed unicycle path-following dynami cs in (31) using
theode45 function of MATLAB.

where blue bars indicate robot speed. Yellow regions show an instance of

time with a signiﬁcantly higher computational cost because
the safety assessment requires the numerical calculation
of the unicycle motion trajectory and the computation of
the distance-to-collision at each trajectory point. On the
other hand, the triangular unicycle motion prediction show s
a comparable performance like forward simulation with a
lower computation cost because of the explicit analytical
form of the motion prediction set in (25) and its simple
triangular shape. The circular unicycle motion prediction
yields the slowest path following motion because it is more
conservative and less accurate than the triangular unicycl e
motion prediction that strongly depends on unicycle positi on
and orientation. We observe that the fully symmetric circul ar
motion prediction is more cautious about irrelevant sidewa ys
collisions with walls while moving along a wall. Overall,
accurate motion prediction is crucial for safe and fast robo t
motion generation around complex (e.g., dynamic) obstacle s.
V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we design a new unicycle headway controller
using an adaptive headway distance that allows the unicycle
position to exactly converge a given goal position. We con-
struct new analytic circular and triangular feedback motio n
prediction sets that bound the closed-loop unicycle motion
trajectory under the adaptive headway controller. Using on -
line path time parametrization, we present an application o f
the adaptive headway controller and its feedback motion
prediction methods for safe path following of a unicycle
robot around obstacles. In our numerical simulations, we
observe that the analytic triangular feedback motion pre-
diction of the adaptive headway controller performs as well
as the computationally expensive forward system simulatio nfor capturing the closed-loop unicycle motion accurately a nd
generating safe and fast unicycle motion.
Our current work focuses on sensor-based safe unicycle
motion design using feedback motion prediction in real
hardware experiments, especially for safe robot navigatio n
in unknown dynamic environments [30]. We also investigate
the use of unicycle feedback motion prediction for multi-
robot navigation and crowd simulation [31].

(x−
/hatwide

C. Proof of Lemma 3
Proof. Ifx = x∗, then all points are located at the goal
(i.e.,
/hatwide
x =/hatwidex = x∗) and so the result holds. Otherwise, using
the deﬁnition of the projected robot position in (14a) and th e
Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, one can obtain the lower bound

By deﬁning α:=(x∗−x)T

D. Proof of Lemma 4
Proof. Ifx = x∗, the result holds because all unicycle
positions are the goal ( x =

x =/hatwidex = x∗) and the unicycle
doesn’t move under the adaptive headway controller in (9).

Similarly, since both tεandnεare constant under the

Hence, the concluding remarks about the decaying distances
of the projected and extended unicycle positions and their
motion range simply follow from their ﬁrst-order convergin g
dynamics to the goal position. /squaresolid

F . Proof of Lemma 6
Proof. Since the adaptive headway controller constantly
turns the robot towards the goal, it follows from Lemma
5 that/bracketleftbigg

using these facts, one can verify that the Euclidean distanc e
of the unicycle position to the goal strictly decreases alon g
