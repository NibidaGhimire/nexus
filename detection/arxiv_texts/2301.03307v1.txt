ABSTRACT
In this work we used ùëÅ-body simulations and a radiative transfer package to model the evolution of eccentric debris disks
producedbygiantimpactsbetweenplanetaryembryos.Thisincludedhowthemorphologyandinfraredemissionofthesedisks
varied with embryo eccentricity and collision true anomaly. We found that eccentric disks inherit the eccentric properties of
the centre of mass orbit of the two colliding embryos. However, the orientation of the collision with the respect to this orbit
plays a key role in determining how closely the disk material resembles the centre of mass orbit. Additionally, we found that
increased eccentricity acted to suppress the formation of certain short-term variations in the disk emission depending on the
collision position. These short-term variations have been associated with an observational phenomenon called extreme debris
disks. Short-term variability has been suggested as a potential signature for giant impacts.

1 INTRODUCTION
Debris disks are one of the most useful observational features of
solar systems, as they encode a large amount of information on the
evolutionofasystemandarefairlyeasytoobservearoundotherstars.
Additionally,debrisdisksappeartobequitecommonwithexamples
in our own Solar System in the form of the Asteroid Belt and the
Kuiper Belt, as well as in many other systems (e.g. Hughes et al.
2018).

This material is composed of particles of a range of sizes from

Debris disks are thought to be the remnants of structures called
protoplanetary disks. These structures are collections of gas and

remnant. Debris disks are therefore generally an order of magnitude
fainter than protoplanetary disks which have fractional luminosity
values of at least ùëì‚âà10‚àí2. Additionally, as a consequence of their
origins, debris disks contain little to no gas and exist around more
mature stars with ages /greaterorsimilar10 Myrs (Alexander et al. 2014). Finally,
debris disks also typically have very low optical depth in optical
wavelengths when compared to protoplanetary disks (e.g. Hughes
etal.2018).Thesefourfactors‚Äìluminosity,systemage,gascontent,

1.1 Extreme Debris Disks
Thestandardmodelfordebrisdisksassumesasteady-statecollisional
cascade which gradually grinds down large 1-100 km planetesimals
intosmallerandsmallerparticles(Wyatt&Dent2002;Quillenetal.
2007; Wyatt 2008). Smaller particles are able to re-emit absorbed
radiation in the infrared much more eÔ¨Éciently than larger particles,
meaningcollisionalgrindinghelpstocreateadustpopulationwhich
is observable through its IR emission. Sub-micron dust particles
are small enough to be aÔ¨Äected by radiation pressure from the host
star, so most simple models assume these particles are blown out
of the debris disk. The balance of collisional grinding and radiation
pressure blow out leads to a stable dust population in the disk. This
implies the observed fractional luminosity should be constant over
orbitaltimescales(Wyattetal.2011).However,itisimportanttonote

amount of dust produced decreases leading to a drop in fractional
luminosity over several hundreds of Myrs (Wyatt 2008).
However, some debris disks do not seem to be sustained by the
traditional steady-state collisional cascade. This sub-class of debris
disksaremuchbrighterthantraditionaldebrisdisksandoftenhighly
variable, so are usually referred to as extreme debris disks (EDDs).
EDDs have average fractional luminosities in excess of 10‚àí2(Meng
et al. 2015), but this value can vary signiÔ¨Åcantly.
Two examples of observed EDDs are ID8 (Meng et al. 2014) and
HD23514(Mengetal.2015).Bothofthesedisksdisplayvariability
in their infrared output. ID8 showed a rapid increase in infrared
luminosity (in the 3.6 ùúám and 4.5 ùúám wavebands) of roughly 40% at
the start of 2013. This was followed by a gradual decay in output
throughout the rest of the year. ID8 also displays short-term, quasi-
periodic variability overlaid on the longer-term decay trend Su et al.
(2019). Observational data of the excess Ô¨Çux from ID8 over 2012
and 2013 is shown in Fig. 1.
HD23514 shows a similar decay trend to ID8 in the 3.6 ùúám and
4.5ùúám wavebands without any signiÔ¨Åcant short-term variability.
These two types of variability both occur on timescales of years
anddecadeswhichismuchfasterthantheMyrevolutiontimescales

(2007). Additionally, they are both found around fairly young stars
withagesof‚àº35Myrand‚àº120Myrrespectively.Attheseages(>10
Myr)protoplanetarydiskswilllikelyhavebeenclearedofgasMath-
ews et al. (2011), implying the unusual brightness and variability
is not related to collisional activity during earliest stages of planet
formation (Meng et al. 2012).
The unusual brightness and variability of EDDs, exempliÔ¨Åed by
ID8 and HD23514, cannot be explained via the traditional, steady-
state model alone. This is because the short-term and medium-term
variations in luminosity of disks like ID8 are far too rapid to be
attributed to the dust produced by slow, collisional grinding. In-
stead, other processes have been suggested to account for these ob-
servations,includingdynamicalinstabilities(Bonsoretal.2013)and
comets scattering into the inner regions of the system (Marino et al.

The sudden appearance of this vapour population could explain the
rapid increase in luminosity of EDDs like ID8. The decay trend of
ID8 and HD23514 could be attributed to the transient nature of the
vapourcondensate.Dustparticlesofthissizearesmallenoughtobe

Numericalsimulationshavesuggestedthatgiantimpactsarecom-
mon in the late stages of terrestrial planet formation (Chambers &
Wetherill 1998; Agnor et al. 1999; Chambers 2001; Quintana et al.
2016) and could play a key role in planet formation. Evidence of
possible giant impacts can be seen across our own Solar System,
includingtheformationoftheMoon(Canup&Asphaug2001;Hart-
mann2014),thesizeandlocationofMercury(Benzetal.1988),the
origin of the Pluto-Charon system (McKinnon 1989; Canup 2010),
and collisional family around Haumea (Leinhardt et al. 2010). This
does provide some evidence that giant impacts would be occurring
at the right time in stellar evolution to cause the observed EDDs.
The observation of EDDs has led severalauthors to a focus on giant
impacts as a possible explanation.
1.2 Previous Work on Modelling Extreme Debris Disks
Jackson et al. (2014) and Jackson & Wyatt (2012) modelled the
dynamicalevolutionofdebrisdisksproducedbyplanetarycollisions.
One of the key conclusions from both of these projects was that the
morphology of the disk is primarily shaped by the collision point.
This is the point in space at which the giant impact occurs. At the
moment of collision all of the source particles which will make up
the disk are located at this point. During the collision the particles
each receive a velocity kick which places the dust on a distribution
of deÔ¨Åned orbits. Over time the dust clump will shear out due to
diÔ¨Äerences in their respective orbits. However, the collision point
remainsaÔ¨Åxedpointonalloftheirorbits.Inotherwords,allparticles
must pass through the collision point. In reality, the collision point
will not be a single point, but a small volume which depends on the
size of the colliding objects. Jackson et al. (2014) assumed a single
point for simplicity.
In addition to the collision point, there is also the anti-collision
line.Thisisaradiallineontheoppositesideofthestartothecollision
point and in the plane of progenitor embryo which all particles will
cross at some point in their orbit. Jackson et al. (2014) found that
this conÔ¨Çuence of orbital paths leads to an asymmetry in the disk
structurewithanover-densityofmaterialinthesetworegionswhich
increases the perceived optical depth. This asymmetry eÔ¨Äect should
create a quasi-periodic variation in the luminosity of the disk on
orbitaltimescales,althoughtheobservabilityofthisvariationwould

explanation for the short-term variability observed in ID8, as well
as the observable characteristics of EDDs more generally. Jackson
etal.(2014)showedthatthisasymmetryeventuallysmearsoutasthe
particle orbits precess over many orbits. Typically, the asymmetric
phase lasts around 1000 orbits, so the observable lifetime largely
depends on the semi-major axis of the original planetary embryo.
Watt et al. (2021) followed on from this work but took a diÔ¨Äerent
approach by simulating the entire process from collision to debris
disk evolution, as well as the expected infrared emission of the de-
bris post-impact. To simulate collisions between planetary embryos
they used a modiÔ¨Åed version of an SPH (smooth particle hydrody-
namics)codecalledGADGET-2(Springel2005;Carter2022).This
code was originally developed to model cosmological events, such
as galaxy cluster formations, however it has been re-purposed to be
used in many other astrophysical contexts, including planet forma-
tion and planetary collisions. The modiÔ¨Åed version of GADGET-2
allows the use of tabulated equations of state (EOS) to determine
thethermodynamicstateoftheparticles(ƒÜuk&Stewart2012).The
planetary embryos were initialised with an iron core and forsterite
mantleusingANEOSequationsofstateforthesetwomaterials(Mar-
cusetal.2009;Melosh2007;Carteretal.2019).Theembryoswere
equilibrated as in previous work (Denman et al. 2020; Carter et al.
2020).
Performing these simulations required an understanding of the
state and composition of the mass ejected from the embryo colli-
sion. As mentioned earlier, numerical simulations have shown that
giant impacts with suÔ¨Écient energy can produce a vapour conden-
satecloudwithparticlesinmm-cmrange(Johnson&Melosh2012),
as well as a more standard population of planetesimals. We refer to
thesetwopopulationsofejectaasthevapourcondensateandboulder
populations respectively.
The boulder population is formed from material that has been
meltedbythegiantimpactandthenre-solidiÔ¨Åedintoplanetesimals.
Theboulderpopulationwouldgenerallycontainlargekm-sizedplan-
etesimals which grind down through a collision cascade until they
reach a steady-state with a Ô¨Åxed size distribution. This size distribu-
tion is usually assumed to resemble a power law based on observa-
tions of debris disks. In this way the disk formed from the boulder
population is similar to a traditional debris disk.
Conversely,thevapourcondensatepopulationformsdirectlyfrom
materialvapourisedinthecollisionandisthoughttobecomposedof
muchsmallerparticles,generallyinthemm/cmrangedependingon
impact velocity and impactor size (Johnson & Melosh 2012). Dust
particles in this size range are able to absorb and re-emit in the in-
frared much more eÔ¨Éciently than larger particles. This implies that
the vapour condensate population would be visible to observers al-
most immediately after the collision. The boulder population would
eventuallybecomevisibleintheinfrared,butwouldtakemuchlonger,
as it would need time for the large planetesimals to grind down into
suÔ¨Écientlysmalldust.ThisdiÔ¨Äerenceinformationwouldalsolikely
haveaneÔ¨Äectonthelifetimeonthesetwopopulations.Assumingwe
considerthetwopopulationscompletelyseparately,thevapourcon-
densate population has no larger planetesimals to replenish its dust
leading to a shorter overall lifetime when compared to the boulder
population.
Given this dichotomy in the ejected mass, an important aspect
of the collision simulation was determining the fraction of mass in
liquidandvapourpost-impact,asthisdictatedtherelativeratioofthe
boulder and vapour condensate populations respectively. Watt et al.
(2021) assumed that the supercritical ejecta cooled isentropically
untilthetriplepointtemperaturewasreachedinsidealiquid-vapourdome determined from the material equation of state. The vapour
fractionofeachSPHparticlewasthencalculatedusingtheleverrule.
This allowed them to determine the mass of the vapour condensate
population.
Watt et al.(2021) assumed that the vapourcondensate population
would be visible immediately after the collision and therefore sim-
ulated the infrared emission from this dusty debris while ignoring
theboulderpopulation.Theyfoundthatincertaincircumstancesthe
infrared emission of the vapour disk could exhibit short-term vari-
ations on orbital timescales, similar to the variations observed in
ID8 and P1121. This was assumed to be related the disk asymmetry
highlighted in Jackson & Wyatt (2012). Increased optical depth at
the collision point and anti-collision line led to a drop in the ob-
served emission. However, the appearance of these variations was

Any factor which suppresses variability would make detection and
characterisation of giant impacts less likely.
The question of the link between giant impacts and EDDs is an
important one, because there is a fundamental tension between our
assumptions and the observations. Giant impacts are thought to be
common during the later stages of planet formation. They are as-
sumedtooccurduringaseparatestageofsolarsystemformationaf-
tertheconclusionoftheoligarchicstage(Kenyon&Bromley2006).

timeofpublication(Mo√≥retal.2021;Melisetal.2012;Mengetal.
2012; Kennedy et al. 2017; Rieke et al. 2021). This implies there
could be something wrong with our assumptions about the regular-
ity of giant impacts or perhaps something about the way EDDs are
formed which makes them diÔ¨Écult to detect and observe.

2 METHODS
Our numerical campaign was broken down into several steps which
we will cover brieÔ¨Çy in this section.
2.1 Modelling the Collisions
The Ô¨Årst step was modelling the collision between the planetary
embryos. Watt et al. (2021) ran a large array of collision scenarios
covering a rangeof impact speeds and impactparameters. However,
wefocussedonasinglecollisionsimulationbetweentwo0.1Earth-
mass embryos (containing 4√ó104SPH particles) with an impact

thefulldetailsofthiscollision.Thegeneralsimulationsetup,includ-
ingembryocompositionandequationsofstateused,areprovidedin
section 1.2 of this paper. Watt et al. (2021) demonstrated that this
particularcollisiongeneratedthemostdistinctshort-termvariations
in infrared emission and provided a good starting point to study the
eÔ¨Äect of orbital eccentricity and collision position on variability.
We used this single SPH simulation to generate three contrasting
baselinecases.Asmentionedearlierinsection1.2,Wattetal.(2021)
found that infrared variability was highly dependent on whether the
collision occurs parallel or perpendicular to the orbital path of the
centre of mass of the two embryos. We therefore rotated the initial
simulationdataby 90‚ó¶toensureweinvestigatedboththeperpendic-
ularandparallelcases.Theimpactparametersofbothofthesecases
are summarised in Table 1.
TheParallelconÔ¨Åguration in Table 1 was a set of parameters
which Watt et al. (2021) showed generated observable short-term
variationsinthesimulateddiskemissionforacircularorbit,whereas
thePerpendicular conÔ¨Åguration did not. Collisions that are parallel
to the orbital path of the centre of mass of the two embryos are
denoted by ùúÉ=0‚ó¶while collisions that occur perpendicular to that
patharedenotedby ùúÉ=90‚ó¶.Theorientationsofthesetwocollisions

lision occurs perpendicular to both the preceding cases. Both the

comprehensive explanation see the full details in Watt et al. (2021).
2.2 Evolving the Particles through Time
In order to evolve the ejecta for several orbits after the collision, the
SPH simulation data was handed over to an ùëÅ-body integrator. The
output SPH particle data we used had been modiÔ¨Åed by Watt et al.
(2021) following the procedure outlined in their work, producing
the vapour condensate population and the two largest remnants of
the collision. This simulation had orbital parameters matching our

(0.146 ùëÄ‚äï) and second largest (0.001 ùëÄ‚äï) remnants account for the

particles were then added to this remnant if their kinetic energy was
less than their potential energy in the centre of mass frame of the
remnant. The process was repeated for the second largest remnant
ignoring the largest remnant particles.
In addition to the extraction of the two largest remnants and the

processwhichmaintainedthevelocitydistributionandthetotalmass

by Watt et al. (2021) and was done to shift the resolution of the
simulationtofocusonthevapourcondensatepopulation,improving
the granularity of the simulation when resolving the more complex

We evolved this system of particles using the leapfrog integrator as
described in Watt et al. (2021).

It is important to make clear that particles used in these ùëÅ-body
simulations are tracers for the mass distribution of the system. In
reality, given the average mass of the particles used in the ùëÅ-body
simulation each particle would be roughly 1 km in radius (assum-
ing a particle density of 3 g cm‚àí3). However, an individual vapour
condensate particle is likely to be between a few microns and a few
millimetresinradius(Johnson&Melosh2012).Inthesesimulations
theùëÅ-bodyparticlesarebeingusedas"super-particles"torepresent
a distribution of dust particles and track the spatial distribution of
the disk mass rather than the positions of individual particles in a
disk. Additionally, the ùëÅ-body particles only interacted gravitation-
ally with the star and the two largest remnants.
2.3 Simulating Disk Emission
We also simulated the total Ô¨Çux emitted by the dust particles in the
disk over time. We used a radiative transfer code package called
RADMC-3D (Dullemond et al. 2012). RADMC-3D takes as input
a cubic grid containing particle densities and one or more energy
sources, usually a single star. It then uses this data to generate syn-
thetic images/spectra.
In our case we generated synthetic images at 0.1 orbit intervals
usingthefollowingprocess-wesetupa3aucubicgridandbinned
the particles into the grid cells based on their current ùëÅ-body posi-
tions.Intotaltherewere301cellsalongeachaxisofthegrid,giving
a total of 3013cubic cells. We input this particle density grid into
RADMC-3D alongside a solar-type star as the single energy source
for the system - simulated using a 5700K blackbody. This involved

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In total, we ran 84 ùëÅ-body simulations using the output of a sin-
gle SPH simulation to generate three diÔ¨Äerent collision scenarios
(Table 1). Using these three conÔ¨Ågurations as base cases, we varied
the centre of mass orbital eccentricity between e=0.0 and e=0.8. In
addition, we varied the position of the collision along the centre of
massorbitwiththetrueanomalyvalue, ùúà,usedtotrackthiscollision
point.Avalueof ùúà=0ùëå0ùúãrepresentedacollisionattheperiapsisof
an eccentric orbit while a value of ùúà=1ùëå0ùúãrepresented a collision
at the apoapsis of an eccentric orbit. We varied the collision point
between ùúà=0ùëå0ùúãandùúà=1ùëå0ùúã.
These parameter limits were chosen because they represented the
extremesoftheparameterspace.Amaximumeccentricityof ùëí=0ùëå8

3.1 The Morphology of Circular Disks
Firstly,weexaminedhowthemorphologyofthegiantimpactejecta
evolves through time on a circular orbit. Simulations from Jackson
etal.(2014),Wyatt&Jackson(2016),andWattetal.(2021)showthat
immediatelyafterthecollisiontheejectaisclumpedtogetherwithout
any discernible structure, however after several orbits of the centre
of mass the material shears out to form a clear disk. We Ô¨Ånd that
this is true throughout all of our simulations, but the precise shape
and structure of the disk varies greatly as we adjust the collision
parameters.
The most distinct morphological diÔ¨Äerence in all of our simu-
lations was found between disks created by Parallelcollisions and
disks created by Perpendicular collisions. This is illustrated for cir-
cular orbits in Fig. 3 which shows the spatial evolution of a debris
disk from a Parallelcollision and a Perpendicular collision on a
circularorbit.ThesnapshotsinthisÔ¨Ågurerangefromjustafewdays

hand, the Parallelcollision produces a largely contiguous disk with
few distinguishable rings. The clear diÔ¨Äerence between disks pro-
duced by ParallelandPerpendicular collisions is consistent across
parameter space explored in this work, although eccentricity and
collision position do have an impact on morphology.
ThediÔ¨Äerenceinthemorphologyofdiskscreatedby Paralleland
Perpendicular collisionscanbeexplainedbyunderstandinghowthe
collisionaÔ¨Äectsthedistributionofsemi-majoraxis.Whenacollision
occurs parallel to the orbital path of the centre of mass of the two
embryos(seeFig.2a),materialispreferentiallyejectedinadirection
perpendicular to the orbital path. The direction of this velocity kick
does not greatly change the orbital path of the ejected particles,
leading to a tight distribution of semi-major axes and a clumpier
disk.Ontheotherhand,whenacollisionoccursperpendiculartothe
centre of mass orbital path (see Fig. 2b), material is preferentially
ejected along the orbital path of the target. This causes a greater
change in the velocities of the ejected particles, leading to a broader
distribution of semi-major axes and a more extended disk. This can
be thought of similarly to prograde/retrograde burn by a satellite
versus a radial/anti-radial burn.
On the end of Fig. 3, we have also included the view looking
towards the x-zandy-zplanes. The y-zplane on both disks has a
typicalÔ¨Çared-outpatternsimilartoabowtie.Thisisbecauseinthis
view we are looking directly at the collision point. This is the pinch
pointthroughwhichallparticlesmustpassatsometime.Eitherside
of the collision point the particle orbits Ô¨Çare out slightly as they all
follow their slightly diÔ¨Äerent orbit inclinations. In the x-zview, we

matches what we would expect from the x-ymorphology.
Using RADMC-3D to calculate the radiance of these disks over
time shows the expected eÔ¨Äect on observation of these two diÔ¨Äerent
morphologies. In Fig. 4a we see clear periodic variation in the radi-
anceofthe Parallelcollisionsimulation.Dipsoccureveryhalf-orbit
which coincides with the collision point and the anti-collision line,
since most of the material tracks closely with the largest remnant ofthe collision. This is what would be expected from the increase in
density and optical depth which occurs at these points (see Fig. 3).
Increased optical depth means the total Ô¨Çux visible to an observer
decreases.Thisiscomparedtothe Perpendicular collisioncase(Fig.
4b) where we see no distinct periodic variation. As highlighted be-
fore and in Watt et al. (2021), the diÔ¨Äerence between these two is
likelyaresultofthediÔ¨Äerentdistributionsofsemi-majoraxisineach
case. The Parallelcase has a tighter distribution of semi-major axis
which creates dense regions of material at the collision point and
anti-collision line. The Perpendicular case has a wider distribution
of semi-major axis which reduces the density of these regions.
3.2 The Morphology of Eccentric Disks
As mentioned in section 2, we ran a number of ùëÅ-body simulations
where the eccentricity of centre of mass orbit and collision position
along the centre of mass orbit were varied between ùëí=0ùëå0and
ùëí=0ùëå8andùúà=0ùëå0ùúãandùúà=1ùëå0ùúãrespectively, where ùúàis the
true anomaly of the collision position with ùúà=0ùëå0ùúãrepresenting
a collision at periapsis and ùúà=1ùëå0ùúãrepresenting a collision at
apoapsis. We wanted to understand how changes in eccentricity of
the centre of mass aÔ¨Äected the structure of the debris disk.
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show how the morphology of the debris disks
changewitheccentricityandcollisionposition.Alldisksareplotted
exactly 10 orbits after the collision. This was chosen because at this
point the structure of the disk had stabilised. Additionally, at this
time the largest remnant of the collision and most of the other disk
material was passing through the collision point (marked by white
arrows in each plot).
WeÔ¨Åndthesamedichotomyinmorphologyexistsbetween Paral-
lelandPerpendicular collisions in eccentric orbits as with circular
orbits. Debris disks from Parallelcollisions are more tightly bound
whereas those from Perpendicular collisions are extended over a
greater range of semi-major axes. Additionally, these debris disks
broadly inherit the eccentric characteristics of the centre of mass
orbitwiththenumberdensityofthedisktracingtheoriginalembryo

We also see the same periodic increase in density at the collision

The eccentricity of the centre of mass also has an eÔ¨Äect on the
spread of semi-major axis values in the disk. For the collisions at
periapsis in both the ParallelandPerpendicular collision cases, in-
creasing eccentricity leads to a greater spread of semi-major axis
values, although this eÔ¨Äect is much more pronounced in the Per-
pendicular case. The reverse eÔ¨Äect occurs for collisions at apoapsis
where the disks are more extended at low eccentricities and become
moretightlyboundaseccentricityisincreased.Thiscanbeexplained
withreferencetoOberthEÔ¨Äectinastronautics(Oberth2014).Accel-
eratingabodywhileitisatitsmaximumorbitalvelocityatperiapsis
will increase the semi-major of the orbit more eÔ¨Éciently, pushing
theapoapsisofthebodyfurtherfromthestar.Deceleratingthebody
at periapsis will have the opposite eÔ¨Äect, circularising the orbit and
decreasing the semi-major axis. The strength of this eÔ¨Äect roughly
scaleswitheccentricity.Inthecaseofa Perpendicular collision,ma-
terial is preferentially kicked parallel or anti-parallel to the velocity
of the centre of mass of the two embryos creating a larger range of
semi-major axis values amongst the ejected particle population. In
theParallelcollision case material is preferentially kicked perpen-
dicular to this velocity, meaning the eÔ¨Äect is much less pronounced.
Accelerating a body while it is travelling more slowly at apoapsis
willgiveamuchsmallerboosttothesemi-majoraxis,soinsteadwe
see a more constrained disk across all eccentricities.
Changing the position of the collision along the orbit has a clear
eÔ¨Äect on the morphology of the disks. For circular orbit and loweccentricity cases shifting the collision position simply rotates the
entire density pattern of the disk when comparing to ùúà=0ùëå0ùúãcase,
but otherwise the morphology remains similar. For example, in row
(a) of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 the ùúà=0ùëå5ùúãcase (Sim. 2 and Sim. 37) is
essentially the ùúà=0ùëå0ùúã(Sim. 0 and Sim. 35) case rotated by 90‚ó¶.
Thehigherdensityregioncreatedbythecollisionpointisobviously
in a diÔ¨Äerent spatial position and disk expansion direction has also
changed.
As we increase eccentricity in the middle two intermediate cases
(ùúà=0ùëå5ùúãandùúà=0ùëå81ùúã), the collision point moves closer to the
apparent periapsis of the eccentric disk. The higher density region
causedbythecollisionpointalsoshiftsaccordinglywiththecollision
point. This is to be expected when the true anomaly is Ô¨Åxed and
eccentricityofanorbitisincreased.Wealsoseeinthesetwomiddle
cases at high eccentricity that the expansion direction of the disk is
no longer on the opposite side of the disk to the collision point, as
theperiapsisandthecollisionpointnolongeralign.Thiscanbeseen
most clearly in the third column of Fig. 6.
We do not seea shift in the apoapsis andperiapsis collision cases
(outer columns of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). Both of the higher density
regionsremainveryclosetotheapoapsisandperiapsisrespectively.
An interesting consequence of increasing eccentricity for collisions

the most extreme case (bottom right of Fig. 6) there is a build-up of
material on the host star. In reality, this material would be accreted
onto the surface of the star, but it does serve to highlight how close
material is getting. As will be shown in the next section, this has an
eÔ¨Äect on the IR output of the disk.
Finally, we also looked at how eccentricity and collision position

Fig. 6 show views towards the x-zandy-zplanes. As with circular
orbits, there is a bow tie structure in the y-zplane for collisions at
apoapsis and periapsis (Ô¨Årst and last columns of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).
This structure gets Ô¨Çattened as eccentricity is increased in the peri-
apsis case, but increases in the height in the apoapsis case. This is

The additional parallel kick component could help to oÔ¨Äset particle

Disks in this case are also much thinner in the z-axis than in the
other orientations, with average scale heights typically a tenth the
size of their corresponding ParallelandPerpendicular disks. This

3.4 Scale Height

diÔ¨Äerentdebrisdisksthroughtime.Initially,wetriedusingasimple
exponential Ô¨Åt of the particle density against height above orbital
plane, however, the density-height proÔ¨Åle did not seem to follow an
exponential decay in every timestep. Instead, we went for a more
general approach and calculated the 36.7th percentile of the particle
density.Whilethismaynotbeexactlyequivalenttothescaleheight,
it can provide a rough estimate that can be used for comparative
purposes.
Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 summarise this scale height information.
Fig.8showsanexampleofhowscaleheightvariesovertheÔ¨Årst10
orbits of Sim. 0. The most obvious trend in this data is the periodic
dips in scale height over the course of a single orbit. This reinforces
our conclusions about the origin of the short-term variations in the
simulated emission shown in section 3.5. The collision point and
anti-collision line are spatially Ô¨Åxed regions in the x-yplane. This
can be seen in the bow tie shape of the disks in the y-zplots of Fig.
5 and Fig. 6. The x-yplane in all of the simulations is deÔ¨Åned by
the orbital plane of the centre of mass of the two colliding embryos.
As the largest remnant and a large proportion of the disk material
passes through the pinch points at the collision point and along the
anti-collision line, the average scale height drops because the x-y
planedeÔ¨Ånesthezeropointoftheheightscale.Thisdropinaverage
scale height implies an increase in density at the pinch points which

The results of this are shown in Fig. 9. One of the primary results
from this is that the average scale height decreases with eccentric-
ity when the collision occurs at the periapsis of the centre of mass
orbit, whereas the average scale height increases with eccentricity
when the collision occurs at apoapsis. This is likely related to the
variation in orbital velocity at diÔ¨Äerent points in an eccentric orbit.

scale height of the disk should be dependent on the distribution of
particleinclinationinthedisk.Awiderinclinationdistributionleads
to a greater average disk scale height. The inclination of a particle
is much easier to change when its orbital velocity is lower, so this is
why we Ô¨Ånd a higher average scale height when the centre of mass
of the two embryos is travelling more slowly.
Thispatternisreinforcedwhenlookingatcollisionpointsbetween
apoapsisandperiapsis.Forexample, ùúà=0ùëå5ùúã(acollisionoccurring

thecentreofmassatthepointofcollisiondoesnotvarysigniÔ¨Åcantly
with eccentricity. When ùúà=0ùëå81ùúãwe see that average scale height
increases with eccentricity. This again matches our expectations as
theorbitalvelocityofthecentreofmassatthepointofcollisionwill
decrease as eccentricity is increased.
Fig. 9 shows the scale height trends for both Parallel(solid blue
line) and Perpendicular collisions (dotted orange line). These lines
followverycloselyacrossall ùúàandeccentricityvalues,implyingthat
the overall trend in average scale height is related to orbital speed
and collision position rather than collision orientation.
3.5 Infrared Emission from Extreme Disks
The Ô¨Ågures in this section contain grids of light curves at various
wavelengthsgeneratedbyradiativetransfer(section2.3)whichshow
how the dust emission of the simulated disks varies over the Ô¨Årst
10 orbits after the embryo collision. Similarly to Fig. 5 and Fig.
6, these Ô¨Ågures show the parameter space we covered during our
investigation. The eccentricity of the centre of mass in the collision
increases as you move down the rows while the true anomaly of the
collision changes from periapsis to apoapsis as you move from left
to right. For example, in Fig. 10, the light curve in the second rowof the Ô¨Ånal column corresponds to a collision occurring at apoapsis
(ùúà=1ùëå0ùúã) on an orbit with eccentricity of 0.2.
Fig. 10 shows the light curves for our simulated collisions occur-
ring parallel to the orbital path of the centre of mass. Short-term
variations are found across all collision positions and eccentricities,
however the periodicity and magnitude of these variations changes
as we traverse the parameter space.
At low eccentricity in Parallelcollisions the dust emission dips
at half-integer orbit intervals, so there are two dips in emission per
orbit. As mentioned in section 3.4, this variation can be related to
the average scale height of the disk. Fig. 8 and the light curves in
the top left of Fig. 10 are generated from the same simulation and
demonstrate dips at similar half-integer intervals.
WealsoÔ¨Åndthataseccentricityisincreasedoneoftheseemission
dipsissuppressed.Forexample,witha Parallelcollisionatperiapsis
(ùúà=0ùëå0ùúã, Ô¨Årst column in Fig. 10), the dip that occurs on each full

at apoapsis ( ùúà=1ùëå0ùúã, Ô¨Ånal column in Fig. 10), the half-integer dip
is suppressed as eccentricity is increased, leaving only the dip that
occursoneachorbit.Additionally,increasedeccentricityalsoresults
in a general increase in the magnitude of dips across all collision
positions.
ItisnotentirelyclearwhatiscausingtheseeÔ¨Äects,butoneofthe
most likely explanations is that ever-changing distance between the
dust and the star in an eccentric orbit creates a periodic variation in
the disk emission. The amount of Ô¨Çux emitted by dust in a debris
disk is dependent on the amount of energy absorbed from the star
which in turn is dependent on the distance to the star. In circular
orbitsthedistancefromthestartoanorbitingbodydoesnotchange
with time, however in eccentric orbits this distance is continually
changing, as a body completes an orbit. This means the amount of
stellar Ô¨Çux received by the dust and therefore the temperature of the
dustcontinuallychangesaswell.Thetemperatureofthedustshould
peak at orbital periapsis and reach a minimum at apoapsis. Hotter
dust will emit more total energy and preferentially emit in shorter
wavelengths.Fig.5andFig.6revealedthatadenserregionofdustis

This increase in density and optical depth causes drops in observed
emission,sopreventingthisbuild-upremovesasourceofvariability.
The only notable exceptions to this result are the light curves
in the bottom right of Fig. 12. These light curves are the result
of a collision occurring at the apoapsis of a highly eccentric orbit
(e=0.8). In these light curves there is some signiÔ¨Åcant variance in
emission, but not the consistent, periodic variation in Fig. 10. We
can attempt to understand this by looking at the morphology of
the highly eccentric disk in Fig. 6 (bottom right). This disk has
the smallest average disk periapsis compared to other disks in this
Ô¨Ågure. Particles making closer approaches to the host star will be
heatedtohigherdusttemperaturesandpreferentiallyemitinshorter
wavelengths while at the periapsis of their orbit. This explanation is
supportedbyFig.13whichshowshowtheaveragedusttemperature

impliestheemissionandtemperaturepeakwhenthelargestremnant
and most of the other disk material is passing through the periapsis
of their orbit. This conclusion is further supported by the relative
Ô¨Çux levels of the diÔ¨Äerent wavelengths in Fig. 12. The average disk
temperature rises over the Ô¨Årst 5 orbits before Ô¨Çattening out which
broadly mirrors the ratio. In general, the shorter wavelengths are
much stronger compared to the other collisions in this Ô¨Ågure. The
initialperiodicvariabilitytendstopeteroutafterafeworbits-likely
due to the rapid Keplerian shearing of the disk. The velocity kicks
from the collision set all dust particles on slightly diÔ¨Äerent orbital
trajectories. Over several orbits the material becomes increasingly
out-of-sync with the original clump of material co-located with the
largest remnant until dust is spread more evenly around the disk
and there is no periodic variation. This shearing eÔ¨Äect may also
account for the shorter wavelengths peaking slightly earlier in the
Ô¨ÅrstfeworbitsofcollisionshowninthebottomrightofFig.12.The
velocitykicksfromthecollisionwillaltertheorbitofsomeamountof

willbeslightlyout-of-syncwiththemainbulkofmaterialaroundthe
largest remnant, so the shorter wavelength peak from this material
will occur at a slightly diÔ¨Äerent time to the main peak tracked by
10ùúám.
Another noteworthy observation in both Fig. 10 and Fig. 12 is
that the 24 ùúám and 10 ùúám Ô¨Çux density lines begin to converge aseccentricity is increased. In some highly eccentric cases the 10 ùúám
lineactuallyexceedsthe24 ùúámline(Row(b)inFig.12androws(d)
and (e) in Fig. 10). This behaviour is consistent across all collision
positions we simulated. In addition, the 3.6 ùúám and 4.5 ùúám lines are
both essentially zero across most of the parameter space, except for
the most extreme eccentricities (Row (b) in Fig. 12 and row (d) and
(e) in Fig. 10) where these Ô¨Çux densities increase. This result again
supports the idea that the short-term variations at higher eccentric-
ities are driven by distance variation. As eccentricity increases, the
averageperiapsisoftheparticlesgetsclosertothestar.Dustparticles
approaching closer to the star will be heated to a higher equilibrium
temperature and preferentially radiate in shorter wavelengths.
An important caveat to these results is that in our ùëÅ-body simu-
lation particles are only removed when they enter the stellar radius.
This is roughly 0.005 au assuming the host star has the same radius
as the Sun. In reality, dust particles are likely to be sublimated at
a much larger semi-major axis. Some of the material that builds up
close to the star, as shown in the bottom right of Fig. 6, may be re-
moved bythis eÔ¨Äectwhich couldsubdue the temperaturevariability
somewhat.ThepersistenceofthismaterialmayparticularlyaÔ¨Äectthe
shorter observation wavelengths (4.5 ùúám and 3.6 ùúám) which do not
seem to drop as expected when the largest remnant passes through
apoapsis. Material building up close to the star (but outside the stel-
lar radius) would help to keep shorter wavelengths more stable than
longer wavelengths.

We also simulated the IR emission from our Perpendicular* col-
lisions where the velocities of the colliding embryos were perpen-
dicular to the centre of mass orbital path andorbital plane. These
collisions preferentially ejected material into the orbital plane of
the disk. Fig. 14 shows the light curves for our simulated collisions
occurring perpendicular to the orbital path of the target embryo.

is a good observable indicator of giant impact collision orientation.
The exceptions to this rule are the cases with extreme eccentricity
and collision positions closer to apoapsis (bottom right of Fig. 15)
where there is some variability on orbital timescales. Similar to the
x-yview, this is likely a result of oscillating dust temperature asthe largest remnant moves from apoapsis to periapsis and back to
apoapsis over the course of a single orbit. This variation would be
reÔ¨Çected in the IR emission.

in Fig. 17, although there might be some dips in the Ô¨Årst two orbits
which could align the disk ansa, broadly there is conspicuous lack
of consistent periodic variability. The dips corresponding to the two

depth is much more consistent over time leading to little variation

Much like the emission in the x-yplane, the magnitude and pe-
riodicity of the emission in the x-zandy-zplanes is dependent on
the centre of mass eccentricity and collision position along the ec-
centric orbit. In general, the x-zcase is qualitatively similar across
ourparameterspacetothe x-ycase,withthemagnitudeofvariations
increasing with eccentricity for apoapsis collisions, but decreasing
for collisions at periapsis. Also, some dips appear to be suppressed
with increasing eccentricity which appears to align with the expla-
nation from the x-ycase that the major driver of Ô¨Çux variation in
more eccentric disks is the distance to the host star as opposed to
changes in optical depth. This can be seen in Fig. 18 which shows
the disk emission in x-zfor a subset of the collision parameters. In

3.6 Comparing with other Published Results
Giantimpact-produceddebrisdiskshavebeenmodelledbefore,most
notably in Jackson et al. (2014). In that work they used analytical
models to predict the dynamical evolution of material released by
a giant collision. Their results for a collision on a circular orbit are

also recreate their collision point and anti-collision line asymmetry.

initial dust distribution, so accounting for anisotropy is vital.
3.7 Comparison with Observed Debris Disks
It is also important to consider how our simulated results compare
to observational instances of EDDs. Direct imaging of debris disks
is quite diÔ¨Écult, so instead we will focus on the excess IR emission
from the disk as the comparison value. In particular, the average
fractional luminosity of the disk and the variability of the emission.
Asofthedateofpublication,therearetensofobservedexamplesof
EDDs(Mo√≥retal.2021).Themostwell-studiedexamplesofEDDs
currently are ID8 and P1121.
3.7.1 ID8 and P1121
ID8 is a young solar-type star in NGC2547 which displays strong
infrared excess, implying the presence of a dusty debris disk. The
average fractional luminosity of ID8 is 3ùëå2√ó10‚àí2(Olofsson et al.
2012).
Yearly variation in the 24ùúáùëöIR excess of ID8 was Ô¨Årst observed
in Meng et al. (2012). Periodicity analysis in Meng et al. (2014)
revealed two signiÔ¨Åcant periods in the IR excess emission of ID8:

Meng et al. (2014) estimated the semi-major axis of the debris
disk in ID8 from periodicity analysis to be roughly 0.33 AU. This is
roughlyconsistentwithanalysisperformedbyOlofssonetal.(2012).
This implies the ID8 disk is slightly smaller than most of the ones
simulated in this work.

a giant-impact produced cloud of debris. As discussed earlier this
explanation implies a dip in disk emission as the largest collision
remnant passes through the collision point and anti-collision line,
increasing dust density in these two regions. As with Meng et al.

In our results for edge-on disks we do not see the additional dips

the disk at the ansae point due to the range of orbital inclinations of
the disk particles. This may help to reduce the optical depth at the
ansae points and avoid a noticeable dip in Ô¨Çux.
3.7.2 V488 Persei
Beyond ID8 and P1121, there are growing numbers of examples of
extremelyvariabledebrisdisks.RecentresultsbyRiekeetal.(2021)
have highlighted a particularly acute example of this type of disk
around V488 Persei. V488 Persei is an 80 Myr-old star (Soderblom
et al. 2014) which places it in a similar age range to ID8 and P1121
and,aswiththosestars,atanagewhereplanetformationisassumed
to be ongoing.
ObservationsoftheinfraredexcessofV488Perseioveranumber
of years revealed a relatively quiescent phase, followed by a major
uplift in emission in 2019. During the quiescent phase the disk is
still extremely variable with excess infrared emission varying be-
tween 30% to 60% of the peak signal at 3.6 ùúám and 60% to 75% for
4.5ùúám.Thisvariabilityispossiblyperiodiconthetimescaleofafew
months,butthisisstilluncertain.Riekeetal.(2021)usedtheDebris
Disk Simulator (Wolf & Hillenbrand 2005) to Ô¨Åt a simple three-
component, optically thin debris disk model consisting of an inner
disk at 0.3-0.35 AU, an outer disk at 25-45 AU, and a distribution
of micron-sized grains extended inward from 0.3 AU. This model
estimated the total fractional luminosity for the inner component at
‚àº3ùëå6% and the outer component between 10-16%. The estimated
fractionalluminosities( ùëì/greatermuch10‚àí3)andvariabilityofthisdiskmarks

such high fractional luminosity and variability implies a very dense
and collisionally active disk. They propose that a massive planet or
brown dwarf has perturbed the inner disk, creating an exceptionally
collisionally active disk with high levels of dust production. They
estimated the amount of dust mass required to produce the major
boost in infrared Ô¨Çux seen in 2019 would be equivalent to an 85 km
planetesimal disintegrating into a power law collisional cascade of
objects. This is well below the size of the planetary embryos that

was followed by a slower decay in emission over time. A possible
complicating factor when comparing this disk to the results of this
work is the assumed pre-existing debris disk. Secondary collisions
andongoinginstabilitycouldhelptomaskthe puresignalofasingle
collision that we have simulated in this work. Further observations
of this extremely active disk over the next few years will be useful.3.8 Methodological Caveats
We employed some simpliÔ¨Åcations in order to reduce computation
timeandmaximizethenumberofsimulationruns.Theseareimpor-
tant to keep in mind when evaluating the results presented here.
Oneofthemostimportantcaveatsforalltheresultsinthisworkis
thatallsimulationrunswerebasedonthe ParallelandPerpendicular
SPH conÔ¨Ågurations outlined in Table 1. In other cases with other
embryomassratios,impactvelocities,andimpactparametersthedisk
morphologiesandIRemissioncouldchangedramatically.However,
these conÔ¨Ågurations were useful as Ô¨Åxed test cases to determine the
eÔ¨Äect of orbital eccentricity.
3.8.1 ùëÅ-body SimpliÔ¨Åcations
A number of simpliÔ¨Åcations were employed in the ùëÅ-body code to
ensuretheparameterspacecouldbecoveredinanacceptableamount
of time.
TheÔ¨ÅrstsimpliÔ¨Åcation,whichhasalreadybeenmentionedinsec-
tion 2, was that we only simulate the dust formed from the vapour
population of the collision - the vapour condensate population. The
primary reason for this is that over such a short simulation time
frame (20 orbits) the vapour condensate population is more likely
to be observationally active. We assume the boulder population will
take much longer to be visible. This is due to the diÔ¨Äerence in as-
sumedparticleformationsizes.Particlesfromthevapourpopulation
willcondenseintosolids ‚àº1cminsizewhereasboulderpopulation
particles are likely to form at a much larger size than this, typically
kilometres in size. The boulder population will eventually become
observationally active as the particles collide and grind down to
smaller sizes, but this will take 100s to 1000s of orbits (dependent
on disk semi-major axis) and we wanted to focus on the population
that would be immediately observable (Jackson et al. 2014).
The only exception to this simpliÔ¨Åcation is the two most massive
remnants from the collision. These are included in the simulation
because they are likely to have a non-negligible eÔ¨Äect on the dy-
namical evolution of the vapour condensate population and can act
as stirring bodies due to their gravitational inÔ¨Çuence. The primary
driver of any stirring will be the largest remnant, as this body was
much more massive than the second largest remnant.
ThesecondsimpliÔ¨Åcationisthatthevapourcondensatepopulation
is not gravitationally active, so none of the particles interact with
each other. Given the small individual masses which constitute this
population this is a reasonable assumption. We can assume that the
bulkofthedynamicalevolutionofthesystemwillbegovernedbythe
central star and the two largest remnants of the boulder population.
Finally, we do not simulate any collisions between vapour con-
densate particles. We would expect the vapour condensate disk to
fade away over time because the particles will be ground down to
the blowout size through mutual collisions. In this work we are pri-
marily interested in determining whether short-term variations on
orbital timescales could be a distinct characterising observational
feature of giant impacts. The important result for this investigation
is understanding whether these variations are present in diÔ¨Äerent
conÔ¨Ågurations rather than their lifetime or observability.
4 CONCLUSIONS
In this work we simulated a number of eccentric debris disks pro-
ducedbygiantimpacts.Weexaminedtheresultantmorphologyand

infrared emission of these objects to gain an understanding of how
diÔ¨Äerent collision parameters can aÔ¨Äect observability.
In total, we ran 84 ùëÅ-body simulations which covered a broad
parameter space of eccentricities and collision positions along the
eccentricorbit.Whenexaminingthemorphologyofthesesimulated
disks over time we found the same basic dichotomy between disks
produced by Parallelcollisions and disks produced by Perpendicu-
larcollisions. Parallelcollisiondisksweremoretightlyboundwhile
Perpendicular collision disks expanded out in spiral ring structures.
We also found that eccentricity and collision positions can alter the
structureofthediskgreatly.Increasingeccentricitycaneitherexpand
orconstrainthediskdependingonthecollisionposition.Collisionsat
theperiapsisofeccentricorbitsgivetheopportunityforlargechanges
in particle semi-major axis by an eÔ¨Äect analogous to the Oberth Ef-
fect. This leads to a more expansive, less tightly constrained disk
which scales with eccentricity. Collisions at apoapsis do not beneÔ¨Åt
from this eÔ¨Äect, so the disks produced by these collisions are gen-
erally more constrained. Increasing eccentricity in this case reduced
the orbital velocity at apoapsis, further reducing the impact of the
Oberth EÔ¨Äect and leading to an even more tightly bound disk. This
pattern was found in both the ParallelandPerpendicular collision
casesbutwasmuchmorepronouncedinthe Perpendicular collision
case,asmaterialispreferentiallyejectedindirectionsparalleltothe
embryo orbit. In the Perpendicular* case, where the collision oc-
curs perpendicular to both the orbital path and orbital plane of the
centre of mass, we found a very similar morphology pattern to the
Perpendicular case with large expansive spiral arms present across
most of the parameter space. The slight diÔ¨Äerentiating feature was
the less well-deÔ¨Åned spiral rings in the Perpendicular* case which
was attributed to the additional parallel kick component providing a
small oÔ¨Äset to the particle orbits.
Beyond the morphology it was also important to examine the ob-
servabilityofalldiskswithintheparameterspace.Usingparticlepo-
sitionsfromthe ùëÅ-bodysimulations,weusedRADMC-3Dtomodel
the total infrared emission of the disks in multiple wavelengths over
time. We found periodic, short-term variations in the mid-infrared
Ô¨Çux of all of the disks created by Parallelcollisions when observed
from face-on (x-y). These variations were not present in the Ô¨Çux
of the disks created by Perpendicular collisions. This supports the
conclusions from Watt et al. (2021) who found the same result for
circularorbits.Thenatureoftheseshort-termvariations,aswiththe
diskstructure,ishighlydependentoncentreofmasseccentricityand
collisionposition.IncreasingeccentricityactstosuppresscertainÔ¨Çux
dipsdependingonthecollisionposition.Forperiapsiscollisions,the
dipateachintegerorbitwassuppressedwithincreasingeccentricity
until at high eccentricity it is no longer visible. For apoapsis colli-
sions, the dip occurring at each half-integer orbit is suppressed with
increasing eccentricity. In both of these cases the new peaks in Ô¨Çux
coincide with a time when most of the disk material is at periapsis,
implyingthattheÔ¨Çuxvariationduetodistancefromthestarisover-
riding any Ô¨Çux variation due to changing optical depth. Increasing
eccentricity also aÔ¨Äects the relative magnitudes of Ô¨Çux at diÔ¨Äerent
wavelengths. The 24ùúám and 10ùúám intensities begin to converge as
eccentricityisincreaseduntilinthee=0.6ande=0.8simulationsthe
10ùúám Ô¨Çux is greater than the 24ùúám Ô¨Çux at certain times. This is
likely due to average periapsis of the particles getting closer to the
host star with increased eccentricity. This leads to higher average
dust temperatures and preferential emission at shorter wavelengths.
This work and Watt et al. (2021) both indicate that short-term
variabilityor‚Äôwiggles‚Äôininfraredemissionisagoodindicatorofthe
sudden appearance of a vapour condensate population, most likely
from giant impact. However, this work also points to the conclusionthat the formation of this variability is highly dependent on several
collision variables, including collision orientation, viewing orienta-
tion,eccentricity,andthetrueanomalyofthecollision.Additionally,
lifetime of this variability is expected to be short due to the rapid
evolution of the vapour condensate population. This may help us to
starttounderstandwhywehaveobservedrelativelyfewdebrisdisks
with distinct short-term variations at present. The parameter space
in which we would expect short-term variations is likely to be fairly
narrow, so while there could be a large number of debris disks pro-
ducedbygiantimpacts,thenumberwithdistinctvariabilitycouldbe
much smaller.
There is clearly much more work required to make any of the
conclusionsabovemoredeÔ¨Ånitive,butatargetforfutureworkcould
be understanding the distribution of extreme disk eccentricities. We
found eccentricity plays a key role in the magnitude of short-term
variations, but if the number of EDDs with larger eccentricities is
small then this eÔ¨Äect is much less important. Eccentric EDDs take
on the eccentric characteristics of their progenitor embryos, so un-
derstandingtheeccentricitydistributionoftheplanetaryembryosin
the early Solar System could give strong hints about the distribu-
tion of disk eccentricities. Additionally, simulating both the vapour
condensate and boulder populations concurrently would allow an
understanding of the full evolution of an impact-produced disk. The
collisionratewithinbothofthesepopulationsiskeytothelongevity
of any disk, so quantifying these values would help to reÔ¨Åne under-
standing of observability.
