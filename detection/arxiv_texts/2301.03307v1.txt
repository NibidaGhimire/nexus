ABSTRACT
In this work we used 𝑁-body simulations and a radiative transfer package to model the evolution of eccentric debris disks
producedbygiantimpactsbetweenplanetaryembryos.Thisincludedhowthemorphologyandinfraredemissionofthesedisks
varied with embryo eccentricity and collision true anomaly. We found that eccentric disks inherit the eccentric properties of
the centre of mass orbit of the two colliding embryos. However, the orientation of the collision with the respect to this orbit
plays a key role in determining how closely the disk material resembles the centre of mass orbit. Additionally, we found that
increased eccentricity acted to suppress the formation of certain short-term variations in the disk emission depending on the
collision position. These short-term variations have been associated with an observational phenomenon called extreme debris
disks. Short-term variability has been suggested as a potential signature for giant impacts.

1 INTRODUCTION
Debris disks are one of the most useful observational features of
solar systems, as they encode a large amount of information on the
evolutionofasystemandarefairlyeasytoobservearoundotherstars.
Additionally,debrisdisksappeartobequitecommonwithexamples
in our own Solar System in the form of the Asteroid Belt and the
Kuiper Belt, as well as in many other systems (e.g. Hughes et al.
2018).

This material is composed of particles of a range of sizes from
larger planetesimals to smaller dust particles. Debris disks are most

inAumannetal.(1984)andhasaninnerradiusof86auandextends

Debris disks are thought to be the remnants of structures called
protoplanetary disks. These structures are collections of gas and

remnant. Debris disks are therefore generally an order of magnitude
fainter than protoplanetary disks which have fractional luminosity
values of at least 𝑓≈10−2. Additionally, as a consequence of their
origins, debris disks contain little to no gas and exist around more
mature stars with ages /greaterorsimilar10 Myrs (Alexander et al. 2014). Finally,
debris disks also typically have very low optical depth in optical
wavelengths when compared to protoplanetary disks (e.g. Hughes
etal.2018).Thesefourfactors–luminosity,systemage,gascontent,

1.1 Extreme Debris Disks
Thestandardmodelfordebrisdisksassumesasteady-statecollisional
cascade which gradually grinds down large 1-100 km planetesimals
intosmallerandsmallerparticles(Wyatt&Dent2002;Quillenetal.
2007; Wyatt 2008). Smaller particles are able to re-emit absorbed
radiation in the infrared much more eﬃciently than larger particles,
meaningcollisionalgrindinghelpstocreateadustpopulationwhich
is observable through its IR emission. Sub-micron dust particles
are small enough to be aﬀected by radiation pressure from the host
star, so most simple models assume these particles are blown out
of the debris disk. The balance of collisional grinding and radiation
pressure blow out leads to a stable dust population in the disk. This
implies the observed fractional luminosity should be constant over
orbitaltimescales(Wyattetal.2011).However,itisimportanttonote

amount of dust produced decreases leading to a drop in fractional
luminosity over several hundreds of Myrs (Wyatt 2008).
However, some debris disks do not seem to be sustained by the
traditional steady-state collisional cascade. This sub-class of debris
disksaremuchbrighterthantraditionaldebrisdisksandoftenhighly
variable, so are usually referred to as extreme debris disks (EDDs).
EDDs have average fractional luminosities in excess of 10−2(Meng
et al. 2015), but this value can vary signiﬁcantly.
Two examples of observed EDDs are ID8 (Meng et al. 2014) and
HD23514(Mengetal.2015).Bothofthesedisksdisplayvariability
in their infrared output. ID8 showed a rapid increase in infrared
luminosity (in the 3.6 𝜇m and 4.5 𝜇m wavebands) of roughly 40% at
the start of 2013. This was followed by a gradual decay in output
throughout the rest of the year. ID8 also displays short-term, quasi-
periodic variability overlaid on the longer-term decay trend Su et al.
(2019). Observational data of the excess ﬂux from ID8 over 2012
and 2013 is shown in Fig. 1.
HD23514 shows a similar decay trend to ID8 in the 3.6 𝜇m and
4.5𝜇m wavebands without any signiﬁcant short-term variability.
These two types of variability both occur on timescales of years
anddecadeswhichismuchfasterthantheMyrevolutiontimescales

(2007). Additionally, they are both found around fairly young stars
withagesof∼35Myrand∼120Myrrespectively.Attheseages(>10
Myr)protoplanetarydiskswilllikelyhavebeenclearedofgasMath-
ews et al. (2011), implying the unusual brightness and variability
is not related to collisional activity during earliest stages of planet
formation (Meng et al. 2012).
The unusual brightness and variability of EDDs, exempliﬁed by
ID8 and HD23514, cannot be explained via the traditional, steady-
state model alone. This is because the short-term and medium-term
variations in luminosity of disks like ID8 are far too rapid to be
attributed to the dust produced by slow, collisional grinding. In-
stead, other processes have been suggested to account for these ob-
servations,includingdynamicalinstabilities(Bonsoretal.2013)and
comets scattering into the inner regions of the system (Marino et al.

The sudden appearance of this vapour population could explain the
rapid increase in luminosity of EDDs like ID8. The decay trend of

Numericalsimulationshavesuggestedthatgiantimpactsarecom-
mon in the late stages of terrestrial planet formation (Chambers &
Wetherill 1998; Agnor et al. 1999; Chambers 2001; Quintana et al.
2016) and could play a key role in planet formation. Evidence of
possible giant impacts can be seen across our own Solar System,
includingtheformationoftheMoon(Canup&Asphaug2001;Hart-
mann2014),thesizeandlocationofMercury(Benzetal.1988),the
origin of the Pluto-Charon system (McKinnon 1989; Canup 2010),
and collisional family around Haumea (Leinhardt et al. 2010). This
does provide some evidence that giant impacts would be occurring
at the right time in stellar evolution to cause the observed EDDs.
The observation of EDDs has led severalauthors to a focus on giant
impacts as a possible explanation.
1.2 Previous Work on Modelling Extreme Debris Disks
Jackson et al. (2014) and Jackson & Wyatt (2012) modelled the
dynamicalevolutionofdebrisdisksproducedbyplanetarycollisions.
One of the key conclusions from both of these projects was that the
morphology of the disk is primarily shaped by the collision point.
This is the point in space at which the giant impact occurs. At the
moment of collision all of the source particles which will make up
the disk are located at this point. During the collision the particles
each receive a velocity kick which places the dust on a distribution
of deﬁned orbits. Over time the dust clump will shear out due to
diﬀerences in their respective orbits. However, the collision point
remainsaﬁxedpointonalloftheirorbits.Inotherwords,allparticles
must pass through the collision point. In reality, the collision point
will not be a single point, but a small volume which depends on the
size of the colliding objects. Jackson et al. (2014) assumed a single
point for simplicity.
In addition to the collision point, there is also the anti-collision
line.Thisisaradiallineontheoppositesideofthestartothecollision
point and in the plane of progenitor embryo which all particles will
cross at some point in their orbit. Jackson et al. (2014) found that
this conﬂuence of orbital paths leads to an asymmetry in the disk
structurewithanover-densityofmaterialinthesetworegionswhich
increases the perceived optical depth. This asymmetry eﬀect should
create a quasi-periodic variation in the luminosity of the disk on
orbitaltimescales,althoughtheobservabilityofthisvariationwould

explanation for the short-term variability observed in ID8, as well
as the observable characteristics of EDDs more generally. Jackson
etal.(2014)showedthatthisasymmetryeventuallysmearsoutasthe
particle orbits precess over many orbits. Typically, the asymmetric
phase lasts around 1000 orbits, so the observable lifetime largely
depends on the semi-major axis of the original planetary embryo.
Watt et al. (2021) followed on from this work but took a diﬀerent
approach by simulating the entire process from collision to debris
disk evolution, as well as the expected infrared emission of the de-
bris post-impact. To simulate collisions between planetary embryos
they used a modiﬁed version of an SPH (smooth particle hydrody-
namics)codecalledGADGET-2(Springel2005;Carter2022).This
code was originally developed to model cosmological events, such
as galaxy cluster formations, however it has been re-purposed to be
used in many other astrophysical contexts, including planet forma-
tion and planetary collisions. The modiﬁed version of GADGET-2
allows the use of tabulated equations of state (EOS) to determine
thethermodynamicstateoftheparticles(Ćuk&Stewart2012).The
planetary embryos were initialised with an iron core and forsterite
mantleusingANEOSequationsofstateforthesetwomaterials(Mar-
cusetal.2009;Melosh2007;Carteretal.2019).Theembryoswere
equilibrated as in previous work (Denman et al. 2020; Carter et al.
2020).
Performing these simulations required an understanding of the
state and composition of the mass ejected from the embryo colli-
sion. As mentioned earlier, numerical simulations have shown that
giant impacts with suﬃcient energy can produce a vapour conden-
satecloudwithparticlesinmm-cmrange(Johnson&Melosh2012),
as well as a more standard population of planetesimals. We refer to
thesetwopopulationsofejectaasthevapourcondensateandboulder
populations respectively.
The boulder population is formed from material that has been
meltedbythegiantimpactandthenre-solidiﬁedintoplanetesimals.
Theboulderpopulationwouldgenerallycontainlargekm-sizedplan-
etesimals which grind down through a collision cascade until they
reach a steady-state with a ﬁxed size distribution. This size distribu-
tion is usually assumed to resemble a power law based on observa-
tions of debris disks. In this way the disk formed from the boulder
population is similar to a traditional debris disk.
Conversely,thevapourcondensatepopulationformsdirectlyfrom
materialvapourisedinthecollisionandisthoughttobecomposedof
muchsmallerparticles,generallyinthemm/cmrangedependingon
impact velocity and impactor size (Johnson & Melosh 2012). Dust
particles in this size range are able to absorb and re-emit in the in-
frared much more eﬃciently than larger particles. This implies that
the vapour condensate population would be visible to observers al-
most immediately after the collision. The boulder population would
eventuallybecomevisibleintheinfrared,butwouldtakemuchlonger,
as it would need time for the large planetesimals to grind down into
suﬃcientlysmalldust.Thisdiﬀerenceinformationwouldalsolikely
haveaneﬀectonthelifetimeonthesetwopopulations.Assumingwe
considerthetwopopulationscompletelyseparately,thevapourcon-
densate population has no larger planetesimals to replenish its dust
leading to a shorter overall lifetime when compared to the boulder
population.
Given this dichotomy in the ejected mass, an important aspect
of the collision simulation was determining the fraction of mass in
liquidandvapourpost-impact,asthisdictatedtherelativeratioofthe
boulder and vapour condensate populations respectively. Watt et al.
(2021) assumed that the supercritical ejecta cooled isentropically
untilthetriplepointtemperaturewasreachedinsidealiquid-vapourdome determined from the material equation of state. The vapour
fractionofeachSPHparticlewasthencalculatedusingtheleverrule.
This allowed them to determine the mass of the vapour condensate
population.
Watt et al.(2021) assumed that the vapourcondensate population
would be visible immediately after the collision and therefore sim-
ulated the infrared emission from this dusty debris while ignoring
theboulderpopulation.Theyfoundthatincertaincircumstancesthe
infrared emission of the vapour disk could exhibit short-term vari-
ations on orbital timescales, similar to the variations observed in
ID8 and P1121. This was assumed to be related the disk asymmetry
highlighted in Jackson & Wyatt (2012). Increased optical depth at
the collision point and anti-collision line led to a drop in the ob-
served emission. However, the appearance of these variations was

tre of mass orbit did not. Variability is a good indicator that dust

Any factor which suppresses variability would make detection and
characterisation of giant impacts less likely.
The question of the link between giant impacts and EDDs is an
important one, because there is a fundamental tension between our
assumptions and the observations. Giant impacts are thought to be
common during the later stages of planet formation. They are as-
sumedtooccurduringaseparatestageofsolarsystemformationaf-
tertheconclusionoftheoligarchicstage(Kenyon&Bromley2006).

timeofpublication(Moóretal.2021;Melisetal.2012;Mengetal.
2012; Kennedy et al. 2017; Rieke et al. 2021). This implies there
could be something wrong with our assumptions about the regular-
ity of giant impacts or perhaps something about the way EDDs are
formed which makes them diﬃcult to detect and observe.

2 METHODS
Our numerical campaign was broken down into several steps which
we will cover brieﬂy in this section.
2.1 Modelling the Collisions
The ﬁrst step was modelling the collision between the planetary
embryos. Watt et al. (2021) ran a large array of collision scenarios
covering a rangeof impact speeds and impactparameters. However,
wefocussedonasinglecollisionsimulationbetweentwo0.1Earth-
mass embryos (containing 4×104SPH particles) with an impact

thefulldetailsofthiscollision.Thegeneralsimulationsetup,includ-
ingembryocompositionandequationsofstateused,areprovidedin
section 1.2 of this paper. Watt et al. (2021) demonstrated that this
particularcollisiongeneratedthemostdistinctshort-termvariations
in infrared emission and provided a good starting point to study the
eﬀect of orbital eccentricity and collision position on variability.
We used this single SPH simulation to generate three contrasting
baselinecases.Asmentionedearlierinsection1.2,Wattetal.(2021)
found that infrared variability was highly dependent on whether the
collision occurs parallel or perpendicular to the orbital path of the
centre of mass of the two embryos. We therefore rotated the initial
simulationdataby 90◦toensureweinvestigatedboththeperpendic-
ularandparallelcases.Theimpactparametersofbothofthesecases
are summarised in Table 1.
TheParallelconﬁguration in Table 1 was a set of parameters
which Watt et al. (2021) showed generated observable short-term
variationsinthesimulateddiskemissionforacircularorbit,whereas
thePerpendicular conﬁguration did not. Collisions that are parallel
to the orbital path of the centre of mass of the two embryos are
denoted by 𝜃=0◦while collisions that occur perpendicular to that
patharedenotedby 𝜃=90◦.Theorientationsofthesetwocollisions
are shown in Fig. 2.
We also performed analysis of a third orientation where the col-
lision occurs perpendicular to both the preceding cases. Both the

two embryos. In this work we consider parallel and perpendicular collision

comprehensive explanation see the full details in Watt et al. (2021).
2.2 Evolving the Particles through Time
In order to evolve the ejecta for several orbits after the collision, the
SPH simulation data was handed over to an 𝑁-body integrator. The
output SPH particle data we used had been modiﬁed by Watt et al.
(2021) following the procedure outlined in their work, producing
the vapour condensate population and the two largest remnants of
the collision. This simulation had orbital parameters matching our
ParallelandPerpendicular conﬁgurationsfromTable1.Thelargest

potential energy as the seed particle for the largest remnant. Other
particles were then added to this remnant if their kinetic energy was
less than their potential energy in the centre of mass frame of the
remnant. The process was repeated for the second largest remnant
ignoring the largest remnant particles.
In addition to the extraction of the two largest remnants and the

vapourmass,thevapourcondensatepopulationwasupscaledusinga
processwhichmaintainedthevelocitydistributionandthetotalmass
oftheoriginalSPHparticles.Thisprocedurewasoriginallyoutlined
by Watt et al. (2021) and was done to shift the resolution of the
simulationtofocusonthevapourcondensatepopulation,improving
the granularity of the simulation when resolving the more complex
gravitationalinteractionoftheseparticles.Thetwolargestremnants

We evolved this system of particles using the leapfrog integrator as
described in Watt et al. (2021).
We ran 84 𝑁-body simulations using the same SPH data output

be used to refer to individual runs throughout the rest of this work.
Weevolvedthesystemineachcasefor20orbitsofthepre-collision
centre of mass orbit.
It is important to make clear that particles used in these 𝑁-body
simulations are tracers for the mass distribution of the system. In
reality, given the average mass of the particles used in the 𝑁-body
simulation each particle would be roughly 1 km in radius (assum-
ing a particle density of 3 g cm−3). However, an individual vapour
condensate particle is likely to be between a few microns and a few
millimetresinradius(Johnson&Melosh2012).Inthesesimulations
the𝑁-bodyparticlesarebeingusedas"super-particles"torepresent
a distribution of dust particles and track the spatial distribution of
the disk mass rather than the positions of individual particles in a
disk. Additionally, the 𝑁-body particles only interacted gravitation-
ally with the star and the two largest remnants.
2.3 Simulating Disk Emission
We also simulated the total ﬂux emitted by the dust particles in the
disk over time. We used a radiative transfer code package called
RADMC-3D (Dullemond et al. 2012). RADMC-3D takes as input
a cubic grid containing particle densities and one or more energy
sources, usually a single star. It then uses this data to generate syn-
thetic images/spectra.
In our case we generated synthetic images at 0.1 orbit intervals
usingthefollowingprocess-wesetupa3aucubicgridandbinned
the particles into the grid cells based on their current 𝑁-body posi-
tions.Intotaltherewere301cellsalongeachaxisofthegrid,giving
a total of 3013cubic cells. We input this particle density grid into
RADMC-3D alongside a solar-type star as the single energy source
for the system - simulated using a 5700K blackbody. This involved
specifyingstellarmass,stellarradius,position,andstellarspectrum.
Additionally, the dust population was assumed to exist in a ﬁxed
power law size distribution with particles sizes ranging from 1mm
to 1𝜇m. The dust opacities were determined from the opacity tool
developedtodeterminetheDIANAstandardopacities(Toon&Ack-
erman 1981; Dorschner et al. 1995; Min et al. 2005; Woitke 2015).
Finally,wejustneededtoconﬁgureRADMC-3Dtoproduceimages
at some common observation wavelengths: 3.6 𝜇m, 4.5 𝜇m, 10 𝜇m
and 24 𝜇m, and select the camera angle. The camera angle deﬁnes
from what direction the image is generated. In this work we limited

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In total, we ran 84 𝑁-body simulations using the output of a sin-
gle SPH simulation to generate three diﬀerent collision scenarios
(Table 1). Using these three conﬁgurations as base cases, we varied
the centre of mass orbital eccentricity between e=0.0 and e=0.8. In
addition, we varied the position of the collision along the centre of
massorbitwiththetrueanomalyvalue, 𝜈,usedtotrackthiscollision
point.Avalueof 𝜈=0𝑌0𝜋representedacollisionattheperiapsisof
an eccentric orbit while a value of 𝜈=1𝑌0𝜋represented a collision
at the apoapsis of an eccentric orbit. We varied the collision point
between 𝜈=0𝑌0𝜋and𝜈=1𝑌0𝜋.
These parameter limits were chosen because they represented the
extremesoftheparameterspace.Amaximumeccentricityof 𝑒=0𝑌8
waschosen,becauseweexpectthenumberofplanetaryembryoson

immediatelyafterthecollisiontheejectaisclumpedtogetherwithout
any discernible structure, however after several orbits of the centre
of mass the material shears out to form a clear disk. We ﬁnd that
this is true throughout all of our simulations, but the precise shape
and structure of the disk varies greatly as we adjust the collision
parameters.
The most distinct morphological diﬀerence in all of our simu-
lations was found between disks created by Parallelcollisions and
disks created by Perpendicular collisions. This is illustrated for cir-
cular orbits in Fig. 3 which shows the spatial evolution of a debris
disk from a Parallelcollision and a Perpendicular collision on a
circularorbit.Thesnapshotsinthisﬁgurerangefromjustafewdays

hand, the Parallelcollision produces a largely contiguous disk with
few distinguishable rings. The clear diﬀerence between disks pro-
duced by ParallelandPerpendicular collisions is consistent across
parameter space explored in this work, although eccentricity and
collision position do have an impact on morphology.

collisionaﬀectsthedistributionofsemi-majoraxis.Whenacollision
occurs parallel to the orbital path of the centre of mass of the two
embryos(seeFig.2a),materialispreferentiallyejectedinadirection
perpendicular to the orbital path. The direction of this velocity kick
does not greatly change the orbital path of the ejected particles,
leading to a tight distribution of semi-major axes and a clumpier
disk.Ontheotherhand,whenacollisionoccursperpendiculartothe
centre of mass orbital path (see Fig. 2b), material is preferentially
ejected along the orbital path of the target. This causes a greater
change in the velocities of the ejected particles, leading to a broader
distribution of semi-major axes and a more extended disk. This can
be thought of similarly to prograde/retrograde burn by a satellite
versus a radial/anti-radial burn.
On the end of Fig. 3, we have also included the view looking
towards the x-zandy-zplanes. The y-zplane on both disks has a
typicalﬂared-outpatternsimilartoabowtie.Thisisbecauseinthis
view we are looking directly at the collision point. This is the pinch

of the collision point the particle orbits ﬂare out slightly as they all

Using RADMC-3D to calculate the radiance of these disks over
time shows the expected eﬀect on observation of these two diﬀerent
morphologies. In Fig. 4a we see clear periodic variation in the radi-
anceofthe Parallelcollisionsimulation.Dipsoccureveryhalf-orbit
which coincides with the collision point and the anti-collision line,
since most of the material tracks closely with the largest remnant ofthe collision. This is what would be expected from the increase in
density and optical depth which occurs at these points (see Fig. 3).
Increased optical depth means the total ﬂux visible to an observer
decreases.Thisiscomparedtothe Perpendicular collisioncase(Fig.
4b) where we see no distinct periodic variation. As highlighted be-
fore and in Watt et al. (2021), the diﬀerence between these two is
likelyaresultofthediﬀerentdistributionsofsemi-majoraxisineach
case. The Parallelcase has a tighter distribution of semi-major axis
which creates dense regions of material at the collision point and
anti-collision line. The Perpendicular case has a wider distribution
of semi-major axis which reduces the density of these regions.
3.2 The Morphology of Eccentric Disks
As mentioned in section 2, we ran a number of 𝑁-body simulations
where the eccentricity of centre of mass orbit and collision position
along the centre of mass orbit were varied between 𝑒=0𝑌0and
𝑒=0𝑌8and𝜈=0𝑌0𝜋and𝜈=1𝑌0𝜋respectively, where 𝜈is the
true anomaly of the collision position with 𝜈=0𝑌0𝜋representing
a collision at periapsis and 𝜈=1𝑌0𝜋representing a collision at
apoapsis. We wanted to understand how changes in eccentricity of
the centre of mass aﬀected the structure of the debris disk.
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show how the morphology of the debris disks
changewitheccentricityandcollisionposition.Alldisksareplotted
exactly 10 orbits after the collision. This was chosen because at this
point the structure of the disk had stabilised. Additionally, at this
time the largest remnant of the collision and most of the other disk
material was passing through the collision point (marked by white
arrows in each plot).
Weﬁndthesamedichotomyinmorphologyexistsbetween Paral-
lelandPerpendicular collisions in eccentric orbits as with circular
orbits. Debris disks from Parallelcollisions are more tightly bound
whereas those from Perpendicular collisions are extended over a
greater range of semi-major axes. Additionally, these debris disks
broadly inherit the eccentric characteristics of the centre of mass
orbitwiththenumberdensityofthedisktracingtheoriginalembryo

We also see the same periodic increase in density at the collision

The eccentricity of the centre of mass also has an eﬀect on the
spread of semi-major axis values in the disk. For the collisions at
periapsis in both the ParallelandPerpendicular collision cases, in-
creasing eccentricity leads to a greater spread of semi-major axis
values, although this eﬀect is much more pronounced in the Per-
pendicular case. The reverse eﬀect occurs for collisions at apoapsis
where the disks are more extended at low eccentricities and become
moretightlyboundaseccentricityisincreased.Thiscanbeexplained

theapoapsisofthebodyfurtherfromthestar.Deceleratingthebody
at periapsis will have the opposite eﬀect, circularising the orbit and
decreasing the semi-major axis. The strength of this eﬀect roughly
scaleswitheccentricity.Inthecaseofa Perpendicular collision,ma-
terial is preferentially kicked parallel or anti-parallel to the velocity
of the centre of mass of the two embryos creating a larger range of
semi-major axis values amongst the ejected particle population. In
theParallelcollision case material is preferentially kicked perpen-
dicular to this velocity, meaning the eﬀect is much less pronounced.
Accelerating a body while it is travelling more slowly at apoapsis
willgiveamuchsmallerboosttothesemi-majoraxis,soinsteadwe
see a more constrained disk across all eccentricities.
Changing the position of the collision along the orbit has a clear
eﬀect on the morphology of the disks. For circular orbit and loweccentricity cases shifting the collision position simply rotates the
entire density pattern of the disk when comparing to 𝜈=0𝑌0𝜋case,
but otherwise the morphology remains similar. For example, in row
(a) of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 the 𝜈=0𝑌5𝜋case (Sim. 2 and Sim. 37) is
essentially the 𝜈=0𝑌0𝜋(Sim. 0 and Sim. 35) case rotated by 90◦.
Thehigherdensityregioncreatedbythecollisionpointisobviously
in a diﬀerent spatial position and disk expansion direction has also
changed.
As we increase eccentricity in the middle two intermediate cases
(𝜈=0𝑌5𝜋and𝜈=0𝑌81𝜋), the collision point moves closer to the
apparent periapsis of the eccentric disk. The higher density region
causedbythecollisionpointalsoshiftsaccordinglywiththecollision
point. This is to be expected when the true anomaly is ﬁxed and
eccentricityofanorbitisincreased.Wealsoseeinthesetwomiddle
cases at high eccentricity that the expansion direction of the disk is
no longer on the opposite side of the disk to the collision point, as
theperiapsisandthecollisionpointnolongeralign.Thiscanbeseen
most clearly in the third column of Fig. 6.
We do not seea shift in the apoapsis andperiapsis collision cases
(outer columns of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). Both of the higher density
regionsremainveryclosetotheapoapsisandperiapsisrespectively.
An interesting consequence of increasing eccentricity for collisions

the most extreme case (bottom right of Fig. 6) there is a build-up of
material on the host star. In reality, this material would be accreted
onto the surface of the star, but it does serve to highlight how close
material is getting. As will be shown in the next section, this has an
eﬀect on the IR output of the disk.
Finally, we also looked at how eccentricity and collision position

Fig. 6 show views towards the x-zandy-zplanes. As with circular
orbits, there is a bow tie structure in the y-zplane for collisions at
apoapsis and periapsis (ﬁrst and last columns of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).
This structure gets ﬂattened as eccentricity is increased in the peri-
apsis case, but increases in the height in the apoapsis case. This is

The additional parallel kick component could help to oﬀset particle

other orientations, with average scale heights typically a tenth the

3.4 Scale Height

diﬀerentdebrisdisksthroughtime.Initially,wetriedusingasimple
exponential ﬁt of the particle density against height above orbital
plane, however, the density-height proﬁle did not seem to follow an
exponential decay in every timestep. Instead, we went for a more
general approach and calculated the 36.7th percentile of the particle
density.Whilethismaynotbeexactlyequivalenttothescaleheight,
it can provide a rough estimate that can be used for comparative
purposes.
Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 summarise this scale height information.
Fig.8showsanexampleofhowscaleheightvariesovertheﬁrst10
orbits of Sim. 0. The most obvious trend in this data is the periodic
dips in scale height over the course of a single orbit. This reinforces
our conclusions about the origin of the short-term variations in the
simulated emission shown in section 3.5. The collision point and
anti-collision line are spatially ﬁxed regions in the x-yplane. This
can be seen in the bow tie shape of the disks in the y-zplots of Fig.
5 and Fig. 6. The x-yplane in all of the simulations is deﬁned by
the orbital plane of the centre of mass of the two colliding embryos.
As the largest remnant and a large proportion of the disk material
passes through the pinch points at the collision point and along the
anti-collision line, the average scale height drops because the x-y

The results of this are shown in Fig. 9. One of the primary results
from this is that the average scale height decreases with eccentric-
ity when the collision occurs at the periapsis of the centre of mass
orbit, whereas the average scale height increases with eccentricity
when the collision occurs at apoapsis. This is likely related to the
variation in orbital velocity at diﬀerent points in an eccentric orbit.

scale height of the disk should be dependent on the distribution of

to a greater average disk scale height. The inclination of a particle
is much easier to change when its orbital velocity is lower, so this is
why we ﬁnd a higher average scale height when the centre of mass
of the two embryos is travelling more slowly.
Thispatternisreinforcedwhenlookingatcollisionpointsbetween

increases with eccentricity. This again matches our expectations as
theorbitalvelocityofthecentreofmassatthepointofcollisionwill
decrease as eccentricity is increased.
Fig. 9 shows the scale height trends for both Parallel(solid blue
line) and Perpendicular collisions (dotted orange line). These lines
followverycloselyacrossall 𝜈andeccentricityvalues,implyingthat
the overall trend in average scale height is related to orbital speed
and collision position rather than collision orientation.
3.5 Infrared Emission from Extreme Disks
The ﬁgures in this section contain grids of light curves at various
wavelengthsgeneratedbyradiativetransfer(section2.3)whichshow
how the dust emission of the simulated disks varies over the ﬁrst
10 orbits after the embryo collision. Similarly to Fig. 5 and Fig.
6, these ﬁgures show the parameter space we covered during our
investigation. The eccentricity of the centre of mass in the collision
increases as you move down the rows while the true anomaly of the
collision changes from periapsis to apoapsis as you move from left
to right. For example, in Fig. 10, the light curve in the second rowof the ﬁnal column corresponds to a collision occurring at apoapsis
(𝜈=1𝑌0𝜋) on an orbit with eccentricity of 0.2.
Fig. 10 shows the light curves for our simulated collisions occur-
ring parallel to the orbital path of the centre of mass. Short-term
variations are found across all collision positions and eccentricities,
however the periodicity and magnitude of these variations changes
as we traverse the parameter space.
At low eccentricity in Parallelcollisions the dust emission dips
at half-integer orbit intervals, so there are two dips in emission per
orbit. As mentioned in section 3.4, this variation can be related to
the average scale height of the disk. Fig. 8 and the light curves in
the top left of Fig. 10 are generated from the same simulation and
demonstrate dips at similar half-integer intervals.
Wealsoﬁndthataseccentricityisincreasedoneoftheseemission

in a general increase in the magnitude of dips across all collision
positions.
Itisnotentirelyclearwhatiscausingtheseeﬀects,butoneofthe
most likely explanations is that ever-changing distance between the
dust and the star in an eccentric orbit creates a periodic variation in
the disk emission. The amount of ﬂux emitted by dust in a debris
disk is dependent on the amount of energy absorbed from the star
which in turn is dependent on the distance to the star. In circular
orbitsthedistancefromthestartoanorbitingbodydoesnotchange
with time, however in eccentric orbits this distance is continually
changing, as a body completes an orbit. This means the amount of
stellar ﬂux received by the dust and therefore the temperature of the
dustcontinuallychangesaswell.Thetemperatureofthedustshould
peak at orbital periapsis and reach a minimum at apoapsis. Hotter
dust will emit more total energy and preferentially emit in shorter
wavelengths.Fig.5andFig.6revealedthatadenserregionofdustis

for aParallelcollision orientation. Average dust temperature was
broadly ﬂat in the circular case but had strong peaks in the highly

The only notable exceptions to this result are the light curves
in the bottom right of Fig. 12. These light curves are the result
of a collision occurring at the apoapsis of a highly eccentric orbit
(e=0.8). In these light curves there is some signiﬁcant variance in
emission, but not the consistent, periodic variation in Fig. 10. We
can attempt to understand this by looking at the morphology of
the highly eccentric disk in Fig. 6 (bottom right). This disk has
the smallest average disk periapsis compared to other disks in this
ﬁgure. Particles making closer approaches to the host star will be

and most of the other disk material is passing through the periapsis
of their orbit. This conclusion is further supported by the relative
ﬂux levels of the diﬀerent wavelengths in Fig. 12. The average disk
temperature rises over the ﬁrst 5 orbits before ﬂattening out which
broadly mirrors the ratio. In general, the shorter wavelengths are
much stronger compared to the other collisions in this ﬁgure. The
initialperiodicvariabilitytendstopeteroutafterafeworbits-likely
due to the rapid Keplerian shearing of the disk. The velocity kicks
from the collision set all dust particles on slightly diﬀerent orbital
trajectories. Over several orbits the material becomes increasingly
out-of-sync with the original clump of material co-located with the
largest remnant until dust is spread more evenly around the disk
and there is no periodic variation. This shearing eﬀect may also
account for the shorter wavelengths peaking slightly earlier in the
ﬁrstfeworbitsofcollisionshowninthebottomrightofFig.12.The

willbeslightlyout-of-syncwiththemainbulkofmaterialaroundthe
largest remnant, so the shorter wavelength peak from this material
will occur at a slightly diﬀerent time to the main peak tracked by
10𝜇m.
Another noteworthy observation in both Fig. 10 and Fig. 12 is
that the 24 𝜇m and 10 𝜇m ﬂux density lines begin to converge aseccentricity is increased. In some highly eccentric cases the 10 𝜇m
lineactuallyexceedsthe24 𝜇mline(Row(b)inFig.12androws(d)
and (e) in Fig. 10). This behaviour is consistent across all collision
positions we simulated. In addition, the 3.6 𝜇m and 4.5 𝜇m lines are
both essentially zero across most of the parameter space, except for
the most extreme eccentricities (Row (b) in Fig. 12 and row (d) and
(e) in Fig. 10) where these ﬂux densities increase. This result again
supports the idea that the short-term variations at higher eccentric-
ities are driven by distance variation. As eccentricity increases, the
averageperiapsisoftheparticlesgetsclosertothestar.Dustparticles
approaching closer to the star will be heated to a higher equilibrium
temperature and preferentially radiate in shorter wavelengths.
An important caveat to these results is that in our 𝑁-body simu-
lation particles are only removed when they enter the stellar radius.
This is roughly 0.005 au assuming the host star has the same radius
as the Sun. In reality, dust particles are likely to be sublimated at
a much larger semi-major axis. Some of the material that builds up
close to the star, as shown in the bottom right of Fig. 6, may be re-
moved bythis eﬀectwhich couldsubdue the temperaturevariability
somewhat.Thepersistenceofthismaterialmayparticularlyaﬀectthe
shorter observation wavelengths (4.5 𝜇m and 3.6 𝜇m) which do not
seem to drop as expected when the largest remnant passes through
apoapsis. Material building up close to the star (but outside the stel-
lar radius) would help to keep shorter wavelengths more stable than
longer wavelengths.

3.5.1 Infrared Emission from Out-of-plane Collisions
We also simulated the IR emission from our Perpendicular* col-
lisions where the velocities of the colliding embryos were perpen-
dicular to the centre of mass orbital path andorbital plane. These
collisions preferentially ejected material into the orbital plane of
the disk. Fig. 14 shows the light curves for our simulated collisions
occurring perpendicular to the orbital path of the target embryo.

observed these disks face-on. This is useful as a starting point for
discussions of morphology and observability, but in reality, we are
likely to see EDDs from various viewing angles.

is a good observable indicator of giant impact collision orientation.
The exceptions to this rule are the cases with extreme eccentricity
and collision positions closer to apoapsis (bottom right of Fig. 15)
where there is some variability on orbital timescales. Similar to the
x-yview, this is likely a result of oscillating dust temperature asthe largest remnant moves from apoapsis to periapsis and back to
apoapsis over the course of a single orbit. This variation would be
reﬂected in the IR emission.

Much like the emission in the x-yplane, the magnitude and pe-
riodicity of the emission in the x-zandy-zplanes is dependent on
the centre of mass eccentricity and collision position along the ec-
centric orbit. In general, the x-zcase is qualitatively similar across
ourparameterspacetothe x-ycase,withthemagnitudeofvariations
increasing with eccentricity for apoapsis collisions, but decreasing
for collisions at periapsis. Also, some dips appear to be suppressed
with increasing eccentricity which appears to align with the expla-
nation from the x-ycase that the major driver of ﬂux variation in
more eccentric disks is the distance to the host star as opposed to
changes in optical depth. This can be seen in Fig. 18 which shows
the disk emission in x-zfor a subset of the collision parameters. In

3.6 Comparing with other Published Results
Giantimpact-produceddebrisdiskshavebeenmodelledbefore,most
notably in Jackson et al. (2014). In that work they used analytical
models to predict the dynamical evolution of material released by
a giant collision. Their results for a collision on a circular orbit are

also recreate their collision point and anti-collision line asymmetry.

initial dust distribution, so accounting for anisotropy is vital.
3.7 Comparison with Observed Debris Disks
It is also important to consider how our simulated results compare
to observational instances of EDDs. Direct imaging of debris disks
is quite diﬃcult, so instead we will focus on the excess IR emission
from the disk as the comparison value. In particular, the average
fractional luminosity of the disk and the variability of the emission.
Asofthedateofpublication,therearetensofobservedexamplesof
EDDs(Moóretal.2021).Themostwell-studiedexamplesofEDDs
currently are ID8 and P1121.
3.7.1 ID8 and P1121
ID8 is a young solar-type star in NGC2547 which displays strong
infrared excess, implying the presence of a dusty debris disk. The
average fractional luminosity of ID8 is 3𝑌2×10−2(Olofsson et al.
2012).
Yearly variation in the 24𝜇𝑚IR excess of ID8 was ﬁrst observed
in Meng et al. (2012). Periodicity analysis in Meng et al. (2014)
revealed two signiﬁcant periods in the IR excess emission of ID8:
𝑃1=25𝑌4±1𝑌1days and 𝑃2=34𝑌0±1𝑌5days. These two periods

Meng et al. (2014) estimated the semi-major axis of the debris
disk in ID8 from periodicity analysis to be roughly 0.33 AU. This is
roughlyconsistentwithanalysisperformedbyOlofssonetal.(2012).
This implies the ID8 disk is slightly smaller than most of the ones
simulated in this work.

a giant-impact produced cloud of debris. As discussed earlier this
explanation implies a dip in disk emission as the largest collision
remnant passes through the collision point and anti-collision line,
increasing dust density in these two regions. As with Meng et al.

In our results for edge-on disks we do not see the additional dips

the disk at the ansae point due to the range of orbital inclinations of
the disk particles. This may help to reduce the optical depth at the
ansae points and avoid a noticeable dip in ﬂux.
3.7.2 V488 Persei
Beyond ID8 and P1121, there are growing numbers of examples of
extremelyvariabledebrisdisks.RecentresultsbyRiekeetal.(2021)
have highlighted a particularly acute example of this type of disk
around V488 Persei. V488 Persei is an 80 Myr-old star (Soderblom
et al. 2014) which places it in a similar age range to ID8 and P1121
and,aswiththosestars,atanagewhereplanetformationisassumed
to be ongoing.
ObservationsoftheinfraredexcessofV488Perseioveranumber
of years revealed a relatively quiescent phase, followed by a major
uplift in emission in 2019. During the quiescent phase the disk is
still extremely variable with excess infrared emission varying be-
tween 30% to 60% of the peak signal at 3.6 𝜇m and 60% to 75% for
4.5𝜇m.Thisvariabilityispossiblyperiodiconthetimescaleofafew

Disk Simulator (Wolf & Hillenbrand 2005) to ﬁt a simple three-
component, optically thin debris disk model consisting of an inner
disk at 0.3-0.35 AU, an outer disk at 25-45 AU, and a distribution
of micron-sized grains extended inward from 0.3 AU. This model
estimated the total fractional luminosity for the inner component at
∼3𝑌6% and the outer component between 10-16%. The estimated

such high fractional luminosity and variability implies a very dense
and collisionally active disk. They propose that a massive planet or
brown dwarf has perturbed the inner disk, creating an exceptionally
collisionally active disk with high levels of dust production. They
estimated the amount of dust mass required to produce the major
boost in infrared ﬂux seen in 2019 would be equivalent to an 85 km
planetesimal disintegrating into a power law collisional cascade of
objects. This is well below the size of the planetary embryos that

was followed by a slower decay in emission over time. A possible
complicating factor when comparing this disk to the results of this
work is the assumed pre-existing debris disk. Secondary collisions
andongoinginstabilitycouldhelptomaskthe puresignalofasingle
collision that we have simulated in this work. Further observations
of this extremely active disk over the next few years will be useful.3.8 Methodological Caveats
We employed some simpliﬁcations in order to reduce computation
timeandmaximizethenumberofsimulationruns.Theseareimpor-
tant to keep in mind when evaluating the results presented here.
Oneofthemostimportantcaveatsforalltheresultsinthisworkis
thatallsimulationrunswerebasedonthe ParallelandPerpendicular

embryomassratios,impactvelocities,andimpactparametersthedisk

these conﬁgurations were useful as ﬁxed test cases to determine the
eﬀect of orbital eccentricity.
3.8.1 𝑁-body Simpliﬁcations
A number of simpliﬁcations were employed in the 𝑁-body code to
ensuretheparameterspacecouldbecoveredinanacceptableamount
of time.
Theﬁrstsimpliﬁcation,whichhasalreadybeenmentionedinsec-
tion 2, was that we only simulate the dust formed from the vapour
population of the collision - the vapour condensate population. The
primary reason for this is that over such a short simulation time
frame (20 orbits) the vapour condensate population is more likely
to be observationally active. We assume the boulder population will
take much longer to be visible. This is due to the diﬀerence in as-
sumedparticleformationsizes.Particlesfromthevapourpopulation
willcondenseintosolids ∼1cminsizewhereasboulderpopulation
particles are likely to form at a much larger size than this, typically
kilometres in size. The boulder population will eventually become
observationally active as the particles collide and grind down to
smaller sizes, but this will take 100s to 1000s of orbits (dependent
on disk semi-major axis) and we wanted to focus on the population
that would be immediately observable (Jackson et al. 2014).
The only exception to this simpliﬁcation is the two most massive
remnants from the collision. These are included in the simulation
because they are likely to have a non-negligible eﬀect on the dy-
namical evolution of the vapour condensate population and can act
as stirring bodies due to their gravitational inﬂuence. The primary
driver of any stirring will be the largest remnant, as this body was
much more massive than the second largest remnant.
Thesecondsimpliﬁcationisthatthevapourcondensatepopulation
is not gravitationally active, so none of the particles interact with
each other. Given the small individual masses which constitute this
population this is a reasonable assumption. We can assume that the
bulkofthedynamicalevolutionofthesystemwillbegovernedbythe
central star and the two largest remnants of the boulder population.
Finally, we do not simulate any collisions between vapour con-
densate particles. We would expect the vapour condensate disk to
fade away over time because the particles will be ground down to
the blowout size through mutual collisions. In this work we are pri-
marily interested in determining whether short-term variations on
orbital timescales could be a distinct characterising observational
feature of giant impacts. The important result for this investigation
is understanding whether these variations are present in diﬀerent
conﬁgurations rather than their lifetime or observability.
4 CONCLUSIONS
In this work we simulated a number of eccentric debris disks pro-
ducedbygiantimpacts.Weexaminedtheresultantmorphologyand

infrared emission of these objects to gain an understanding of how
diﬀerent collision parameters can aﬀect observability.
In total, we ran 84 𝑁-body simulations which covered a broad
parameter space of eccentricities and collision positions along the
eccentricorbit.Whenexaminingthemorphologyofthesesimulated
disks over time we found the same basic dichotomy between disks
produced by Parallelcollisions and disks produced by Perpendicu-
larcollisions. Parallelcollisiondisksweremoretightlyboundwhile
Perpendicular collision disks expanded out in spiral ring structures.
We also found that eccentricity and collision positions can alter the

theperiapsisofeccentricorbitsgivetheopportunityforlargechanges
in particle semi-major axis by an eﬀect analogous to the Oberth Ef-
fect. This leads to a more expansive, less tightly constrained disk
which scales with eccentricity. Collisions at apoapsis do not beneﬁt
from this eﬀect, so the disks produced by these collisions are gen-
erally more constrained. Increasing eccentricity in this case reduced
the orbital velocity at apoapsis, further reducing the impact of the
Oberth Eﬀect and leading to an even more tightly bound disk. This
pattern was found in both the ParallelandPerpendicular collision
casesbutwasmuchmorepronouncedinthe Perpendicular collision
case,asmaterialispreferentiallyejectedindirectionsparalleltothe
embryo orbit. In the Perpendicular* case, where the collision oc-
curs perpendicular to both the orbital path and orbital plane of the
centre of mass, we found a very similar morphology pattern to the
Perpendicular case with large expansive spiral arms present across
most of the parameter space. The slight diﬀerentiating feature was
the less well-deﬁned spiral rings in the Perpendicular* case which
was attributed to the additional parallel kick component providing a
small oﬀset to the particle orbits.
Beyond the morphology it was also important to examine the ob-
servabilityofalldiskswithintheparameterspace.Usingparticlepo-
sitionsfromthe 𝑁-bodysimulations,weusedRADMC-3Dtomodel
the total infrared emission of the disks in multiple wavelengths over
time. We found periodic, short-term variations in the mid-infrared
ﬂux of all of the disks created by Parallelcollisions when observed
from face-on (x-y). These variations were not present in the ﬂux
of the disks created by Perpendicular collisions. This supports the
conclusions from Watt et al. (2021) who found the same result for
circularorbits.Thenatureoftheseshort-termvariations,aswiththe

until at high eccentricity it is no longer visible. For apoapsis colli-
sions, the dip occurring at each half-integer orbit is suppressed with
increasing eccentricity. In both of these cases the new peaks in ﬂux
coincide with a time when most of the disk material is at periapsis,
implyingthattheﬂuxvariationduetodistancefromthestarisover-
riding any ﬂux variation due to changing optical depth. Increasing
eccentricity also aﬀects the relative magnitudes of ﬂux at diﬀerent
wavelengths. The 24𝜇m and 10𝜇m intensities begin to converge as
eccentricityisincreaseduntilinthee=0.6ande=0.8simulationsthe
10𝜇m ﬂux is greater than the 24𝜇m ﬂux at certain times. This is
likely due to average periapsis of the particles getting closer to the
host star with increased eccentricity. This leads to higher average
dust temperatures and preferential emission at shorter wavelengths.
This work and Watt et al. (2021) both indicate that short-term
variabilityor’wiggles’ininfraredemissionisagoodindicatorofthe
sudden appearance of a vapour condensate population, most likely
from giant impact. However, this work also points to the conclusionthat the formation of this variability is highly dependent on several
collision variables, including collision orientation, viewing orienta-
tion,eccentricity,andthetrueanomalyofthecollision.Additionally,
lifetime of this variability is expected to be short due to the rapid
evolution of the vapour condensate population. This may help us to
starttounderstandwhywehaveobservedrelativelyfewdebrisdisks
with distinct short-term variations at present. The parameter space
in which we would expect short-term variations is likely to be fairly
narrow, so while there could be a large number of debris disks pro-
ducedbygiantimpacts,thenumberwithdistinctvariabilitycouldbe
much smaller.
There is clearly much more work required to make any of the
conclusionsabovemoredeﬁnitive,butatargetforfutureworkcould
be understanding the distribution of extreme disk eccentricities. We
found eccentricity plays a key role in the magnitude of short-term
variations, but if the number of EDDs with larger eccentricities is
small then this eﬀect is much less important. Eccentric EDDs take
on the eccentric characteristics of their progenitor embryos, so un-
derstandingtheeccentricitydistributionoftheplanetaryembryosin
the early Solar System could give strong hints about the distribu-
tion of disk eccentricities. Additionally, simulating both the vapour
condensate and boulder populations concurrently would allow an
understanding of the full evolution of an impact-produced disk. The
collisionratewithinbothofthesepopulationsiskeytothelongevity
of any disk, so quantifying these values would help to reﬁne under-
standing of observability.
