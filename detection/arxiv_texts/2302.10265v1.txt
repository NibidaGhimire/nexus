arXiv:2302.10265v1  [math.PR]  20 Feb 2023On convergence of volume of level sets of stationary
smooth Gaussian ﬁelds
Dmitry Beliaev∗Akshay Hegde∗
Abstract
We prove convergence of Hausdorﬀ measure of level sets of smo oth Gaussian ﬁelds
when the levels converge. Given two coupled stationary ﬁeld sf1,f2, we estimate the
diﬀerence of Hausdorﬀ measure of level sets in expectation, in terms of C2-ﬂuctuations
of the ﬁeld F=f1−f2. The main idea in the proof is to represent diﬀerence in
volume as an integral of mean curvature using the divergence theorem. This approach
is diﬀerent from using Kac-Rice type formula as main tool in t he analysis.
1 Introduction
SmoothGaussianﬁeldsappearnaturallyinsomeareasofmathematic sandphysics. Random
plane waves are conjectured to describe local behaviour of partic les in chaotic domains, to
give an example [5]. It also interacts well with other topics such as pe rcolation theory
[3]. Random ﬁelds have found some applications in areas as diverse as o ceanography [7],
cosmology [2], medical imaging [11].
Studying geometrical and topological properties of the ﬁeld, espe cially of level/excursion
sets of the ﬁeld is of great interest. Particularly, functionals such as volume of level sets,
number connected components of level sets are well studied (see [10],[9]). In problems
involving Gaussian ﬁelds, sometimes one needs to compare two ﬁelds, say by coupling them,
when their laws are close. Comparing geometric observables are of p articular interest. We
show that, with probability close to one, diﬀerence in Hausdorﬀ meas ures ofnodal sets
(i.e. the zero sets) of coupled ﬁelds with ‘close’ laws is small. The main ide a in the proof
is to represent diﬀerence in volumes of level sets as an integral of m ean curvature of the
hypersurface using the divergence theorem. This representatio n is classical in Riemannian
geometry and has been used extensively in study of minimal surface s [6, Chapter 1]. The
novelty is to get an average estimate of the diﬀerence in volumes in th e context of Gaussian
ﬁelds. Also, we don’t rely on Kac-Rice (or any other variation of co-a rea formula) for the
analysis of volume of level sets, which is a standard tool in this topic. As a by product, we
give an explicit formula for the mean curvature of level sets at a give n level. We believe
that proving convergence in distribution of Hausdorﬀ measure of le vel sets can be done by
following the proof idea of Kac-Rice as presented in [1, Theorem 6.2]. But it might not be
as straight forward as our proof, and proving other convergenc es might require some new
ideas.

12 Results
In this article, we consider smooth Gaussian ﬁelds f:Rd→Rwith mild non-degeneracy
conditions,ofﬁxeddimension d≥2. Callaﬁeld stationary ifthecovariancekernel K(x,y) =
E[f(x)f(y)] is translation invariant. Now for stationary ﬁelds, the kernel Kis a Fourier
transform of a ﬁnite symmetric Borel measure ρ, called spectral measure (normalised to
probability measure in this article).
Fix a domain D= [−R,R]d⊂Rd. Consider two C2-smooth Gaussian ﬁelds f1,f2:Rd→R
and a coupling of the ﬁelds f1,f2, by abuse of notation, such that F=f1−f2has the
C2-ﬂuctuations
σ2
D:= sup
x∈Dsup
|α|≤2Var[∂αF(x)].
Assumptions 2.1. Assume that the ﬁelds f1,f2are
1. stationary, C2-smooth a.s.
2. non-degenerate, i.e. (fi,∇fi)has density in Rd+1fori= 1,2.
3. Morse functions a.s.
LetLndenoten-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Let Hndenote the n- dimensional Haus-
dorﬀ measure, which is scaled so that Hn([0,1]n) =Ln([0,1]n). Note that by Bulinskaya
lemma (see [8, section 5.3]), a.s. nodal sets are sub-manifolds of Rdof co-dimension one. So
we interchangeably use the terms volume and Hausdorﬀ measure.
Theorem 2.2. LetHd−1(f−1
i(a))denote the volume of level sets in the domain D. With
the setup as above, we have
E|Hd−1(f−1
1(0))−Hd−1(f−1
2(0))| ≤C(f1,f2)(Ld(D)/radicalbig
logR)σ1/7
D
assumingσDis small enough (say, σD<1). Here, the constant C(f1,f2)depends only on
the laws of the ﬁelds and not the coupling.
The factor√logRappearing in the above theorem is from the quantitative version of K ol-
mogorov’s existence theorem for smooth Gaussian ﬁelds as stated in [8, Appendix A]. Also,
the exponent 1 /7 inσ1/7
Dis not optimal, and can be made close to 1 /4. We believe optimal
exponent of σDis 1 due to cancellations in the integral of mean curvature in the bulk.
We make some comments on the assumptions on the ﬁelds. We would like to point out that
the proof of Theorem 2.2 works for non-stationary, non-degene rate ﬁelds with positive lower
bounds on ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld and its derivatives, with suitable m odiﬁcations. We have
not used stationarity in any serious way, but the estimations of the bounds become much
easier if we assume stationarity. Also, assumption that the ﬁelds ar e a.s. Morse functions is
not very restrictive and many interesting non-degenerate ﬁelds w e know are Morse functions
a.s. It can be shown that stationary ﬁelds with spectral measures containing an open sets
are Morse a.s. If the ﬁeld is isotropic, then also we can show that the ﬁeld is Morse a.s. In
particular, random plane wave (RPW) model and Bargmann-Fock ﬁe ld (onRd) are Morse
a.s.
One such coupling of ﬁelds is available using coupling of white noises (see [4]). The coupling
as in [4] gives the following estimate for the ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld F=f1−f2. We have,
σ2
D≤C(Rd+1) inf
ρ∈P(ρ1,ρ2)/integraldisplay
(|s|2+|t|2+1)2+1|s−t|2dρ(s,t)
2whereP(ρ1,ρ2) is the space of all symmetric couplings of ρ1andρ2andCis a absolute
constant.
Now by the coupling techniques mentioned above, σDcan be controlled by the transport
distances between the measures in the domain (in the general case ) or by norm of diﬀerences
in spectral densities (in special cases). Let’s give an example where this is useful. Recall
that the spectral measure of random planar waves is the uniform m easure on the unit circle
inR2. We can approximate this measure, in the transport distance ment ioned above, by a
measure supported on ﬁnite points. This ﬁeld corresponds to a ﬁnit e interference of pure
sine waves. So we can quantitative bounds on the diﬀerence of lengt hs.
To proveTheorem 2.2, ﬁrst we study convergenceofvolume ofleve l sets using the divergence
theorem. Although expressing change in volume of a hypersurface in normal direction in
terms of mean curvature is classical as previously mentioned, we ne ed the version as in
Proposition 2.3.
Proposition 2.3. Letf:Rd→Rbe a non-degenerate, C2-smooth Gaussian ﬁeld which is
Morse function a.s. Let Hd−1(f−1(a))denote the volume of level set f−1(a)inD. Then,
almost surely, we have
Hd−1(f−1(b))−Hd−1(f−1(a)) =/integraldisplay/integraldisplay

where

is ((d−1)-times) the mean curvature of level set of fatxandˆηis the outward unit normal
to∂D. We also have
Hd−1(f−1(b))→ Hd−1(f−1(a)),asb→a
almost surely and in L1.
As a corollary, we get the following formula for the mean curvature o f level sets at a given
level. Usually, it is hard to get such explicit formula for general ﬁelds.
Corollary 2.4. With assumptions as in Theorem 2.2 , we have
E[κ|f=a] =−aE[|∇f|].
3 Proofs
Proof of Proposition 2.3. Note thatfhas only ﬁnitely many critical points in Da.s. We
prove in subsection 3.1 that κas a function on Dis integrable almost surely. We also can
assume that fhas no critical points on ∂D. This is because of Bulinskaya lemma, since
∂Dis (d−1)-dimensional and for non-degenerate, smooth Gaussian fthe gradient ∇fhas
(Gaussian) density on Rd.
Case 1:a,bare regular values of f.
LetR′=D∩f−1[a,b] and the unit outwardnormal ˆ η=−∇f/|∇f|onf−1(a), ˆη=∇f/|∇f|
onf−1(b) (assuming a < b), outward normal on parts of ∂D∩f−1(a,b). Assume that R′
has no critical points of fand we know that κis continuous except at critical points of f.
Apply Greens formula for the function ∇f/|∇f|onR′, we get

ButﬁrsttwotermsofLHS ofaboveequationare Hd−1(f−1(b)),−Hd−1(f−1(a)) respectively.
Hence we get equation (1) in this case.
IfR′has critical points of f, then the number of critical points has to be ﬁnite. Let
{x1,x2,...xk}be the critical points in R′. Now apply the divergence theorem to the ﬁeld
∇f/|∇f|onR′\∪jBδ(xj). Lettingδ→0, and using integrability κonD(see subsection
3.1), we again get equation (1).
Case 2:aorb(or both) are critical values of f.
First, let us show continuity of volume of level sets at all levels, includ ing at critical values
off. Fix a critical value aoff. By Morse lemma, fcan be made a quadratic function at a
critical point by re-parametrisation. Let pbe a critical point, then there is a neighborhood
Uofpand a smooth chart ( y1,y2,...,y d) such that yi(p) = 0 and
f(y) =f(p)±y2
1±y2
2···±y2
d.
We know that the volume of level sets of quadratic functions are co ntinuous. So, given a
critical point poffat levela, volume of level sets of fin a neighborhood Uofpconverge
when the levels converge to a. Whenx0∈f−1(a) is a regular point, then there exists a
neighborhood Ux0such that the volume of level sets are continuous. This follows from the
implicit function theorem. Now, using compactness of f−1(a)∩D, we get that volume of
level sets is continuous at any arbitrary level.
Since the number of critical values of fis ﬁnite in D, any critical level in Dcan be ap-
proximated by regular levels of finD. Letǫnbe a sequence converging to zero such that
(b−ǫn),(a+ǫn) are sequences of regular values of f. By continuity of the volume of level
sets, we have
Hd−1(f−1(b))−Hd−1(f−1(a)) = lim
n→∞[L(b−ǫn)−L(a+ǫn)].
Using case 1, we have the integral formula for diﬀerence of volume o f level sets. Note that
/angbracketleftbigg∇f

κ /BDf∈[a+ǫn,b−ǫn]→κ /BDf∈[a,b]
pointwise. Hence by the dominated convergence theorem, we have equation (1) for case 2
as well.
We havethat Hd−1(f−1(b))→ Hd−1(f−1(a)) asb→aa.s. by abovediscussion ofcontinuity
of length w.r.t levels. We also have E[Hd−1(f−1(b))]→E[Hd−1(f−1(a))] whenb→aby
Kac-Rice formula. Hence, by Scheﬀe’s lemma, we have L1convergence.
Proof of Corollary 2.4. Take expectation to both sides of the equation (1). Switching inte-
gration and expectation because of Fubini’s theorem, we get

b−a=−ap(a)Ld(D)E[|∇f|].
Next, from the continuity of the Gaussian regression formula, we g et the respective con-
ditional expectations (see [1, Theorem 3.2] for an explanation). Co nsider the expression
E[κ /BDf∈[a,b]] and write it in the following form,
E[κ /BDf∈[a,b]] =/integraldisplayb

Now note that E[κ|f=u] is continuous in u, hence (b−a)−1E[κ /BDf∈[a,b]]→E[κ|f=a] as
b→a. By the dominated convergence theorem, we have

Now, we claim that/contintegraldisplay

dS = 0.
Since∇fandfare pointwise independent r.v. and by stationary, integral on a ( d−1)-
dimensional slab in ∂Dcancels that from the opposite slab. Again by stationarity of κ, the
equation (3) reduces to E[κ|f=a]p(a) =−aE[|∇f|]p(a). Hence we have the Corollary 2.4.
Proof of Theorem 2.2. First, observe that Hd−1(f−1(a))→0 almost surely as a→ ∞or
asa→ −∞, since probability that fis unbounded on Dis zero. Now, taking diﬀerence of

First let us prove that E[|κ|1+α]<∞ford= 2 case. The general case follows from
similar computation. Observe that x= (x1,x2,x3,x4,x5) = (∂xf,∂yf,∂xxf,∂xyf,∂yyf) is a

the law of ( ∂xxf,∂xyf,∂yyf). Letx= (x1,x2) andx′= (x3,x4,x5).

||∇f(x)|| ≥C||x−x0||
||H(f)−1x0||.
Since∂xxf,∂xyf,∂yyfareallboundedon Dand|∂xf(x)| ≤c1||x−x0||,|∂yf(x)| ≤c2||x−x0||

But we have /integraldisplay

8Product of Gaussian random variables : IfX,Yare standard Gaussians of correlation
ρ, then the density of the product Z=XYis given by
ψZ(z) =1
π/radicalbig
1−ρ2exp/parenleftbiggρz
1−ρ2/parenrightbigg
K0/parenleftbigg|z|
1−ρ2/parenrightbigg

whereK0is the Bessel function of the second kind. Integrating ψoverR+,
P(Z >0) =π−arccos(ρ)
π(16)
i.e. this probability is close to 1 or 0 for ρclose to±1.
