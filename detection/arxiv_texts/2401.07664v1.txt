We explore the gravitational waves (GWs) within the framework of the f(R) gravity model
represented by f(R) =R1+δ/Rδ
cin the weak field approximation. In this scenario, gravitational
waves exhibit an additional polarization mode beyond the standard transverse-traceless (TT) tensor
modes. We show that the polarization characteristics of these waves are connected to the scalaron
mass and the effective potential derived from the function f(R). Furthermore, the study of the
speed of gravitational waves ( cg) within the Horndeski theory, particularly using the f(R) model,
reveals an intriguing feature about the equality of the speed of gravitational waves to that that
of electromagnetic waves. This equivalence arises due to the modification introduced in the Ricci
scalar within the f(R) model.
I. INTRODUCTION
Einstein’s General Relativity (GR) has evidently stood
as an invaluable tool for addressing a wide range of cos-
mological issues related to gravitation. We have amassed
a wealth of observational evidence supporting the exis-
tence of dark energy, such as data from sources like Su-
pernovae type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO),
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, and
weak gravitational lensing, among others [1–4]. Dark en-
ergy, though not yet well known, is largely understood
to be responsible for the ongoing accelerated expansion
of the universe.
Efforts to modify GR can be broadly categorized into
two classes: (i) modified gravity models and (ii) mod-
ified matter models. In modified gravity models [5–9],
the gravitational aspect of the Einstein-Hilbert action
is altered in various ways. Numerous modified grav-
ity models, such as f(R) theory, Scalar-Tensor theories,
Braneworld models, and Gauss-Bonnet dark energy mod-
els, have been proposed and explored. Conversely, modi-
fied matter models [10–13] introduce an additional com-
ponent of matter into the energy-momentum tensor of
GR. Quintessence [14], k-essence, and phantom dark en-
ergy models are some examples of modified matter mod-
els.
The standard model of cosmology, often referred to as
the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) model, provides
a robust framework for explaining the late-time cosmic
acceleration [15–17]. However, it faces challenges related
to the cosmological constant Λ. Modified gravity mod-
els, particularly f(R) gravity models, have emerged as
successful alternatives for addressing both the dark mat-
ter and dark energy problems by leveraging the concept
of the scalaron mass. This mass exhibits dark matter-
like effects on local scales and behaves as dark energy on
cosmological scales[18].
Among the various f(R) models, the present paper
∗cosmoskunal94@gmail.com
†balkrishnalko@gmail.com
‡sunilmmv@yahoo.comfocuses on our previous model f(R) =R1+δ/Rδ
cas dis-
cussed in detail in our work at small and large scales
[19–21]. This model provides a sophisticated explanation
of the two distinct phases of the universe. Specifically,
it delves into how the mass of the scalaron depends on
theδparameter at galactic scales, revealing a sharp de-
crease for smaller values of δand a subsequent increase
for larger values. This insight enhances our understand-
ing of the dynamical behaviour of the universe at both,
local and cosmological, scales.
The significant progress in addressing cosmological
challenges owes much to the introduction of gravitational
waves (GWs), a ground breaking discovery made in 2023
when the NANOGrav Collaboration [22] successfully de-
tected gravitational waves through variations in Pulsar
timing arrays [23]. Several findings suggest that these
waves hold tremendous potential for shedding light on
various cosmological questions, including the early infla-
tionary epoch, where we have already shown the scalar
spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio being very close
to the recent observational data [20], age of the uni-
verse, the Hubble parameter, dark matter and dark en-
ergy. This also proves to be an asset for detection of
black holes (BHs), Super Massive Black Holes(SMBHs)
and their dynamical evolution such as spin etc [24].
In the framework of Einstein’s General Relativity
(GR), the plane wave solution for gravitational waves
encompasses two distinct polarization modes as plus
(+) mode polarization and cross( ×) mode polarizations,
which shows the behaviour of gravitational waves in weak
field limit in GR.
This paper aims to focus on the gravitational waves in
the weak field approximation limit in the modified f(R)
gravity model and investigate the modes of polarisation
that exist due to the effective generalisation of the Ricci
scalar. It has been argued that the energy carried by
these additional modes would cause perturbation in the
angular momentum of the inspiralling compact binary
system and change the phase evolution of tensor modes.
We hope that if the phase correction due to scalar modes
can be measured through their distinct waveforms, that
would indicate the existence of these modes and would
be able to constrain f(R) model parameters. The ob-arXiv:2401.07664v1  [gr-qc]  15 Jan 20242
servations of GW170814 and GW170817 also put some
constraints on the energy flux of the scalar modes com-
parable in magnitude to that of the tensor modes [25].
Another important aspect discussed in this paper is
the speed of gravitational waves cg. To understand the
puzzling features of the universe like the events occuring
beyond the event horizon of the black hole and super-
massive black holes, pre-big-bang evolution, and other
unsolved cosmological problems, we need to have a clear
knowledge of the speed of GWs along with its counter-
part electromagnetic (EM) waves. From theoretical point
of view, if the speed of GWs exceeds the speed of EM ra-
diations, then the GWs can show a distinct behaviour as
they propagate inside the highly dense objects like SMB
or as stochastic waves in post-inflationary era. Further,
if we find the speed as scale dependent, it can also lead
to significant features at quantum scales too [26].
Using the more generalised Horndeski theory, we can
estimate the speed of GWs [27, 28]. There are vari-
ous models like Quintessence and k-essence, Brans Dicke
model, Covariant Galileons, Derivative couplings, Gauss-
Bonnet couplings etc. but in this paper we have used f(R)
theory as a special case of Horndeski theory, to calculate
the speed of gravitational waves and compare it to the
EM counterpart.
Thus, the present paper is organized in four sections.
In Section II we discuss the background of field equations
inf(R) gravity and conformal transformation from the
Jordan frame to the Einstein frame including an intro-
duction of GWs in the field equations. Section III covers
solution to waves equations in the f(R) gravity model
and examination of the resulting polarisation modes. In
Section IV, we explore the speed of these waves in our
specific model. Section V encapsulates the summary and
conclusion.
II. f(R)GRAVITY AND LINEARIZATION OF
GRAVITATIONAL WAVES
In this section, we discuss about the modification made
in geometric part of the Einstein’s field equations.
We begin with the 4-dimensional action in the general
f(R) gravity model which contains the modification of
Ricci scalar in some functional form. Thus, the action is
modified as
A=1
2κ2Z
dx√−gf(R) +Am(gµν, ψm), (1)
where κ2= 8πGandAmis the action of the matter
field ψm. The Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) spacetime is given as
ds2=−dt2+a2(t)[dr2+r2(dθ2+sin2θdϕ2)],(2)
where a(t) is the time dependent scale factor and speed
of light c= 1. The Einstein’s field equations then can be
obtained as
F(R)Rµν−1
2gµνf(R) +gµν2F(R)−∇µ∇νF(R) =κ2Tµν,(3)
where F(R) =d f/dR andTµνis the energy-momentum
tensor contributed by matter.
Taking the trace of (3) in vacuum ( Tµ
µ= 0), we obtain
32F(R) +RF(R)−2f(R) = 0 . (4)
By conformally transforming from the Jordan frame to
the Einstein frame, the new action can be written as
[29, 30, 33]
A=Z
d4xp
−˜g1
2κ2˜R−1
2˜gµν∂µϕ∂νϕ−V(ϕ)
+Am,(5)
where
V(ϕ) =FR−f
2κ2F2. (6)
represents the potential in a general class of f(R) models
showing the emergence of a new scalar degree of free-
dom and an overhead tilde denotes the quantities in the
Einstein frame.
In this modified gravity background, we consider dark
matter as scalaron particle corresponding to field ϕwhich
is related to F(R) in the Einstein frame as
Ω2=F(R) =e−2Qκϕ, (7)
where Qis the strength of coupling between scalar field
ϕand non-relativistic matter and is given as
Q=−1√
6. (8)
Thus, by varying the action (5) with respect to scalar
field ϕ, the Klein-Gordon equation for effective scalar
fieldϕis obtained as [29, 30, 33]
˜2ϕ=dV(ϕ)
dϕ+κ√
6˜T≡dVeff(ϕ)
dϕ, (9)
where Veff(ϕ) is the effective potential whose sec-
ond derivative provides scalar field a mass as m2
ϕ=
d2Veff(ϕmin)/dϕ2, with Veff(ϕ) having the minimum
value at ϕmin.
The gravitational waves are extremely weak at the
point very far from the sources, and so they can be lin-
earized. Thus, the metric can be characterized in covari-
ant form as given below.
gµν=ηµν+hµν. (10)
where gµνis the metric, ηµνis the background metric and
hµνis the small perturbation in the background metric
with the condition |hµν|<<1.3
The contravariant counterpart of the metric in (10) can
be written as
gµν=ηµν−hµν. (11)
The linearization of the modified Einstein field equa-
tions leads to
F(R)Rµν+1
2(ηµν+hµν)f(R) + (ηµν+hµν)2F(R)
−∇µ∇νF(R) = 0 .(12)
It is assumed that the sources of field for this condition
are very far from the point where gravitational waves are
detected, so Am= 0 = ⇒Tµν= 0 [30, 34].

GRAVITATIONAL WAVES FOR f(R) =R1+δ/Rδ

TYPE MODELS
The constant tangential velocity condition of the test
particle specifies that the motion of the test particle is
stable in the orbits of spiral galaxies, which indicates that
f(R) is proportional to R1+δ, where δ << 1. A generic
f(R) model gives rise to the scalar degree of freedom and,
in particular, can be represented as
f(R) =R1+δ
Rδc, (13)
where Rcis a constant having dimensions of Ricci Scalar
R,δis the model parameter and δ << 1. The derivative
off(R) in equation (13) is given as
F(R) = (1 + δ)Rδ
Rδc. (14)

From the above equation, it is evident that the massive
mode polarisation depends on the mass of the scalaron
which itself is dependent on δ. So, the massive field shows
complete dependence on the model. The plane wave
equation for transverse mode of polarisation is written
as
2hµν= 0. (25)
On solving equations (23) and (24) together we obtain
[30]
hµν=Bµν(p)eikαxα(26)
and
hs=H(q)eiqαxα(27)
are added to the plus and cross polarization terms are
added, which is now given as [30]
¯hµν=h+e(+)

Since the polarized wave is travelling along the Z-
direction, these polarizations modify to

tent with dark matter in our earlier work [19], we can
constrain vg. It may be compared to the constraints ob-
tained on the velocity through the mass of gravitons mg
as (mg/ωorbital )2<0.003 by consideration of energy loss
in form of emission of massive gravitons from compact
binary systems [31, 32]. In our model, using equation

(which includes a stochastic GW background). This can
be used as an effective tool to distinguish the cosmolog-
ical models beyond GR from the GR-based models over
a wide range of frequencies in the future GW detectors.
We explore the behaviour of the velocity vgon our model
parameters as the waves propagate through the matter
background.

manifestation of the chameleon mechanism in the higher
density regions where mass of scalaron mϕbecomes too
large in response to the matter environment and conse-
quently, the Compton wavelength of scalaron becomes
extremely small. This leads to the collapse of scalar field
and the gravitational wave loses the scalar longitudinal
mode. The plot also shows that the speed of the grav-
itational waves does not change much for different val-
ues of Rc. This is because the value of Rcis extremely
small compared to the much higher contribution from
frequency (which is actually the lowest, as taken here) in
the extremely low frequency (ELF) band 10−15−10−18

In addition to frequency 10−18Hz taken in Figure 1,
further, the variation of vgis plotted for a set of other
frequencies (10−8Hz, 10−2Hz and 100 Hz) in Figures
2, 3, and 4, respectively. Here, we use a single value of
Rc= Λ and a common matter density background of
galaxies ρ= 10−42(GeV)4, and attempt to examine the
effects on these vastly different frequencies which arise
from different sources and fall within the detection range
of the present or future detectors. It can be clearly seen
that for higher frequencies, vggets more sharply closer
toc= 1 for successively lower values of model parameter
δ. This combined multi-frequency behaviour over the
large range of δ= 0−10−4is shown in Figure 5, where
only 10−18Hz coming from the stochastic gravitational
wave background displays a distinct variation, while at all
other chosen frequencies, velocity vgis uniformly equal6
to that of light.
In Figure 6, we observe a significant variation in vg
with the background matter density for different values
ofδ. When δis of very low order ∼10−5, the value of vg
drops sharply with matter density, but when it increases
further, then close to δ= 0.001 and 0 .1, the curve ap-
proximates speed of light c= 1 for the given range of
ρ. This is due to rising mass of scalaron with decreasing
value of δ. We find that ρis also dominant for the value
ofδ <10−3or lower, and becomes successively less effec-
tive for the higher values of δ. Thus, smaller values of δ,
and higher background densities, both provide a higher
mass to scalarons, and so, both are favourable for reduc-
ing the speed of the longitudinal mode. At the given
galactic background density, the degree of elimination of
the longitudinal mode will grow for smaller values of δ
and may escape detection. Thus, using the cosmological
constraints on mass of scalaron from the consideration of
age of the universe etc., we can conclude that the longi-
tudinal mode of GWs does not propagate at the speed of
light when δis very small and mass of scalarons becomes
high.
IV. SPEED OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IN
HORNDESKI THEORY USING f(R)GRAVITY
The detection of gravitational waves from the event
GW170817 provided the possibility of determination
of their velocity. Several efforts, such as in Horn-
deski theory, emerged with an extended scope of study
[27, 28, 35, 36]. The Lagrangian from the generalised
action
A=Z
d4x√−gL (33)
can be written using this theory as [35]
L=G2(ϕ, X)+G3(ϕ, X)2ϕ+G4(ϕ, X)R+G4,X(ϕ, X)[(2ϕ)2
−(∇µ∇νϕ)(∇µ∇νϕ)] +G5(ϕ, X)Gµν∇µ∇νϕ

where G2,3,4,5depend on ϕandX, and Gi,ϕ≡∂Gi/∂ϕ
andGi,X≡∂Gi/∂X with
X=−1
2∇µϕ∇µϕ. (35)
Using f(R) gravity model we can write action (33)
in terms of equation (1). Thus, the Lagrangian
can be transformed accordingly with the choice of
G2, G3, G4, G5, and all these parameters take the formG2=RF−f, G 3= 0, G 4=F, G 5= 0. (36)
Using the equivalence principle, we can transform the
values of the above parameters in terms of ϕwhich leads
to the following equations,

The speed of the gravitational waves cgpropagating over

Horndeski theory as

Further, we consider the second term of the denominator
of equation (38) as
G4,X=∂G

2
3κϕ
∂[˙ϕ2− ∇ϕ2]= 0. (41)
From equations (40) and (41), we obtain c2
g= 1 This
implies that the GWs would propagate with the speed of
light in this case.
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In the present paper, we investigated the gravitational
waves in an f(R) gravity model and found that the con-
ventional transverse polarisation modes (plus and cross)
are accompanied by a massive polarisation mode along
the Z-direction of the wave propagation, which is pro-
duced due to the scalar degree of freedom associated with
the modification in the geometrical part of the Einstein-
Hilbert action. The scalar field seems to play no direct
role in the transverse modes of polarisation, but causes
the creation and propagation of this massive longitudinal
mode. This hsmode varies with mϕ, and thus, is sensi-
tive to even an extremely small variation in the powers
of Ricci scalar. The velocity curves plotted in Figures
show that this longitudinal mode of gravitational wave7
cannot propagate when δ= 0. However, depending on
frequency (10−18Hz, 10−8Hz, 10−2Hz and 100 Hz cor-
responding to stochastic GW background imprinted on
CMB, NANOGrav, future LISA and present LIGO detec-
tors, respectively), the speed of propagation in galactic
matter background picks up sharply and jumps to speed
of light as δis switched on. Thus, for example, we find
that for a 100 Hz astrophysical GW longitudinal mode,
its velocity jumps very sharply to speed of light even as
δslightly increases beyond 10−44.
Thus, it can be interpreted that in GR limit where
mass is infinite, the longitudinal modes of vibration can-
not be formed. On the other hand, when we calculate the
speed of the gravitational waves using Horndeski theory,
it is found exactly equal to the speed of light. Using
thef(R) model as a special case in Horndeski theory, wehave only the Ricci curvature in the field equations which
contributes to the conformal part, but when we consider
the Riemannian part we find an inequality in the speed
of GWs and speed of light. This anomalous speed of
GWs is due to the involvement of Weyl curvature tensor
when G5becomes non zero. These consideration allow
us to formulate a Weyl criterion for anamolous speed of
spin-2 GWs [26, 37] using the Newman-Penrose formal-
ism which will be discussed in our subsequent work.
