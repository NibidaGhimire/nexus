Pauli blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon that also serves as a powerful tool for qubit
manipulation and read-out. While most systems exhibit a simple even-odd pattern of double-dot
Pauli spin blockade due to the preferred singlet pairing of spins, the additional valley degree of free-
dom offered by bilayer graphene greatly alters this pattern. Inspecting bias-triangle measurements
at double-dot charge degeneracies with up to four electrons in each dot reveals a much richer double-
dot Pauli blockade catalogue with both spin and/or valley blockade. In addition, we use single-dot
Kondo effect measurements to substantiate our understanding of the three- and four-particle state
spectra by analyzing their magnetic field dependence. With high controllability and reported long
valley- and spin-relaxation times, bilayer graphene is a rising platform for hosting semiconductor
quantum dot qubits. A thorough understanding of state spectra is crucial for qubit design and ma-
nipulation, and the rich Pauli blockade catalogue provides an abundance of novel qubit operational
possibilities and opportunities to explore intriguing spin and valley physics.
HCarbon-based materials are promising hosts for
spin-qubits [1–4] due to the natural abundance of 98 .9%
low-mass, nuclear-spin free12C. Experimental advance-
ments achieved in recent years [2–8, 10–14, 16, 17, 20, 21]
have demonstrated the great potential for electrostat-
ically defined bilayer graphene (BLG) quantum dots
(QDs) to host spin and valley qubits, with highly tun-
able QDs’ geometry and tunnel couplings, as well as
gate-tunable valley g-factors [4], and reported remark-
ably long valley-relaxation time T1>500 ms [20], and
spin-relaxation times T1up to 50 ms [16, 17, 20], compa-
rable with the state-of-the-art results achieved in other
semiconductor quantum dot systems [22].
To harvest the full potential of BLG QDs, a thorough
understanding of the relevant QD state spectra is essen-
tial. In BLG, in addition to spins, up and down, there
exist two valleys, K+and K−, which couple to an exter-
nal perpendicular magnetic field due to their non-trivial
Berry curvature [2, 4, 10, 24, 25]. These valleys enrich the
spectra of BLG, and lead to intriguing properties, such
as the spin-triplet valley-singlet single-dot two-particle
ground state [11, 13–15], and the double-dot two-carrier
Pauli spin- and valley-blockade [3]. Most other systems,
i.e. systems without valleys, exhibit no Pauli blockade
when an oddnumber of carriers reside in a double dot
due to the preferred singlet pairing of spins [23, 28–32].
In contrast, in BLG three-carrier spin blockade has been
demonstrated recently [5].
Not limited to three carriers, the entire double-dot
Pauli blockade catalogue with up to four carriers (i.e.,
a full shell) in each dot is far richer for BLG than for a
conventional system. Our main result is summarized inFig. 1(a), a comparison of schematic double-dot charge
stability diagrams for (i) BLG and for (ii) a conventional
system. In a conventional system, an even-odd pattern of
Pauli spin-blocked and non-blocked transitions arise [23];
in contrast, in BLG Pauli blockade could arise from both
spin andvalley selection rules. The rich blockade struc-
ture provides a multitude of novel qubit operational po-
sitions, allowing us to exploit the unique spin and valley
physics for varied qubit manipulation and control [33].
In this work, we study transport measurements
through BLG double quantum dot (DQD). By analyz-
ing finite-bias triangles at various charge degeneracies,
we discuss the states and transitions involved, and hence
the nature of the observed Pauli blockade as summarized
in Fig. 1(a), going beyond the previously discussed two-
carrier [3] and three-carrier [5] cases. Substantiating our
understanding of the three- and four-particle state spec-
tra experimentally, we further present transport measure-
ments through a single BLG QD, probing the magnetic
field dependence of the state spectra with the Kondo ef-
fect (similar to Ref. [10]).
The BLG QDs are defined electrostatically [device
shown in Fig. 1(b)]. We use the bandgap arising from
a perpendicular displacement field [7–9], achieved by the
global backgate and various local top-gates. The split-
gates [Fig. 1(b,i), gray] form a 1D channel. Another
layer of gates (red and blue) locally tune the potential
landscape within this channel. See Supplemental Mate-
rials S1 [37] for more detail.
We form an electron DQD with n-type leads and
tunable tunnel barriers [potential landscape depicted in
Fig. 1(b,ii)]. The plunger gate voltages VLandVRde-arXiv:2305.03479v2  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  10 Apr 20242

plied between the source and drain leads, finite-bias tri-
angles form at triple-points where three charge config-
urations coexist. The distinctive honeycomb pattern of
the double-dot charge stability diagram is observed on
Fig. 1(c). Charging energies ∼6–10 meV are estimated
for both dots, much larger than the energy scales that
will be considered in the following discussions.
The nature of Pauli blockade is determined by the rel-
evant spin and valley states involved. Understanding the
blockade therefore demands a discussion on the single-
dotN-particle state spectra [sketched in Fig. 2(a)]. We
choose to discuss the states first with the single-particle
notation:
One-particle : The four-fold spin and valley states are
split by a small (60–80 µeV) Kane–Mele [10, 12, 38] spin–orbit gap ∆ SOinto two Kramer pairs: lower-energy ↓
K−and↑K+, and higher-energy ↓K+and↑K−. At
zero field, ∆ SOquantizes the spins and valleys along the
direction perpendicular to the BLG sheet.
Two-particles : The spin-triplet valley-singlet is the
ground state, as shown in Refs. [11, 13–15] and
Fig. 2(a,ii).
Three-particles : Taking three of the four available
states for one-particle gives us the spectrum shown
in Fig. 2(a,iii), with Kramers pairs ↓K−↑K+↓K+
and↓K−↑K+↑K−lower, and ↓K+↑K−↓K−and
↓K+↑K−↑K+higher in energy.
Four-particles : Four carriers complete the shell, occu-
pying all the available states in the lowest energy orbital.
Alternative to the single-particle notation, we can also
write the states with their quantum numbers: the to-
tal spin (valley) number σ(τ), and their projections to
the spin (valley) quantization-axis σz(τz). We define
σz=±1/2 for spins ↑/↓, and τz=±1/2 for valleys K±.
This notation |σ, σz;τ, τz⟩is marked in Fig. 2(a) for the
ground states at zero magnetic fields (black). The val-
ley quantization-axis is always out-of-plane, whereas the
spin quantization-axis is out-of-plane at zero B-field due
to ∆ SO[10, 12], and tilts towards in-plane in external B∥.
AB-field applied in any direction shifts spin states ener-
gies by σzgsµBB, while only an out-of-plane field shifts
the valley states energies by τzgvµBB⊥, where µBis the
Bohr magneton, gs= 2 the spin g-factor [2, 10, 13], and
gv≫gsthe gap-size and dot-geometry dependent valley
g-factor [4, 10].
Since the interdot coupling is weak, we can choose to
write the double-dot states as product states of the single
dot states in the left and in the right dot, written in a
bracket ( |NL⟩,|NR⟩). The spin (valley) projection of a
double-dot state is thus simply the sum of its constituting
single dot states σz=σz,NL+σz,NR(τz=τz,NL+τz,NR).
Since both spin–orbit [38, 39] and valley–orbit [40] effects
are weak in BLG, we assume that tunneling conserves
all the spin and valley numbers. Transitions between
double-dot charge configurations are notblocked only if,
for every degenerate ground state of the initial charge
configuration, there exists a state in the final charge con-
figuration being lower in energy and matching all quan-
tum numbers with the initial state. Otherwise, some
form of Pauli blockade arises; its nature depends on the
mismatched quantum number (spin and/or valley).
In Fig. 2(b), we present zoom-ins of the finite-bias tri-
angles labeled with Roman numerals i–vii in Fig. 1(c).
The barrier gate voltages are adjusted slightly such that
the dot geometry and tunnel couplings are similar for
different charge transitions. Charge-configuration transi-
tions (dashed arrows) can be non-blocked (black), spin-
blocked (red), or valley-blocked (blue):
(i) (1 ,0)–(0,1): Any loaded electron hops between the
two dots with the same one-particle states. No blockade
is observed: the bias-triangles are complete for both bias3

directions.
(ii) (1 ,1)–(0,2): Studied in Ref. [3], the system is stuck
when a (1 ,1) state with τz=±1 (valley-polarized state,
e.g., K−in both dots) is loaded, as transition to the (0 ,2)
ground state with τz= 0 (paired valley-singlet S v) is for-
bidden by valley conservation. The valley-blocked tran-
sition (1 ,1)→(0,2) suppresses the current in the bias-
triangles [right, Fig. 2(b,ii)], as compared to the non-
blocked ones (left).
(iii) (1 ,2)–(0,3): Studied in Ref. [5], transition (1 ,2)→
(0,3) is spin-blocked: The system is stuck in the max-
imally spin-polarized (1 ,2) states σz=±3/2 [e.g. ( ↓
,T−
s)], since the (0 ,3) ground state can only offer σz=
±1/2 states [41, 42]. Current in the (1 ,2)→(0,3) bias-
triangles [right, Fig. 2(b,iii)] is therefore strongly sup-
pressed, as compared to the non-blocked (0 ,3)→(1,2)ones (left). The spin-blockade current suppression is
stronger here than that of valley-blockade in (ii). Marked
by a square at detuning ∼0.6 meV, transport resumes
when the (0 ,3) excited state with σz=±3/2 [(0,↓↓↓
/↑↑↑), Fig. 2(a,iii) gray] becomes lower in energy than
the (1 ,2) ground state.
(iv) (1 ,3)–(0,4): Transition (0 ,4)→(1,3) is non-
blocked, where (1 ,3)→(0,4) is both spin and val-
ley blocked with strong current suppression: The (1 ,3)
ground state can be spin ( σz=±1) or valley ( τz=±1)
polarized, whereas (0 ,4) only accepts a spin and val-
ley paired full shell. The blockade lifts (indicated by
the triangle) when the polarized (0 ,4) excited state with
σz=±1 (0,↓↓/↑↑) orτz±1 (0,K−K−/K+K+) [gray in
Fig. 2(a,iv)] becomes accessible at detuning ∼0.8 meV.
(v) (2 ,1)–(1,2): Since the states in the two charge con-4
figurations are essentially the same with only the roles of
the left and the right dot switched, no blockade exists in
either direction.
(vi) (2 ,2)–(1,3): Both sets of bias-triangles in
Fig. 2(b,vi) show regions with current suppression, with
spin-blockade (right) stronger than valley-blockade (left).
For (2 ,2)→(1,3), a fully spin-polarized (2 ,2) ground
state with σz=±2, e.g. (T−
sSv,T−
sSv), is blocked to the
(1,3) ground state where the maximally spin-polarized
state has only σz=±1, e.g. ( ↓K−,↓K−↑K+↓K+).
This spin-blockade is lifted (marked by the square) upon
accessing the spin-polarized excited three-particle states
↓↓↓/↑↑↑in the right dot [gray in Fig. 2(a,iii)]. For
(1,3)→(2,2), a valley-polarized (1 ,3) ground state
with τz=±1, e.g. ( ↓K−,↓K−↑K+↑K−) is blocked
to the (2 ,2) ground state that allows only fully-paired
valleys (T sSv,TsSv) with τz= 0. This valley block-
ade is lifted (marked by the circle) upon accessing the
valley-polarized excited two-particle states S sT±[gray
in Fig. 2(a,ii)] in either dot. Here, transitions in both
directions are Pauli blocked but for different quantum
numbers—an intriguing situation special to BLG.
(vii) (1 ,4)–(2,3): The transition (2 ,3)→(1,4) is
spin-blocked and (1 ,4)→(2,3) non-blocked, demon-
strated by the strong current suppression in the right
bias-triangles as compared to the left ones in Fig. 2(b,vii).
The (1 ,4) state, a full-shell in the right dot and a
single electron in the left dot, cannot accommodate
the maximally spin-polarized (2 ,3) state with σz=
±3/2, e.g. (T−
sSv,↓K−↑K+↓K+). The spin block-
ade lifts (marked by the triangle) upon accessing the
spin-polarized four-particle excited state ↓↓/↑↑[gray
in Fig. 2(a,iv)] in the right dot.
The nature of Pauli blockade at various charge tran-
sitions is summarized in Fig. 1(a) and compared with
the conventional case where levels are filled with alter-
nating spins. The richer structure in BLG stems from
(1) the additional valley degrees of freedom, and as a re-
sult (2) the single-dot two-particle ground state being a
spin-triplet [11, 13] instead of a spin-singlet.
From the above discussion, we see that the maximally
spin- (valley-) polarized [i.e., with maximum |σz|(|τz|)]
double dot ground state of a charge configuration is re-
sponsible for spin (valley) blockade. The maximum |σz|
(|τz|) can be found by simply summing the total spin
(valley) quantum number of the left and right single dot
ground states σNL+σNR(τNL+τNR). We can therefore
summarize the above discussion into a simpler rule [illus-
trated in Fig. 2(c)]: If the total spin (valley) number of
the double dot ground state of the final charge configura-
tionσf(τf) is lower than that of the initial charge con-
figuration σi(τi), then there are (at least) initial states
with σz=±σi(τz=±τi) that do not exist in the fi-
nal ground states, and this transition is spin- (valley-)
blocked.
To substantiate the proposed three- and four-particlestates spectra in Fig. 2(a) that form the basis of the
double-dot Pauli blockade analysis, we present experi-
mental data investigating the spectra in magnetic field
with the single-dot Kondo effect [43], similar to the anal-
ysis performed in Ref. [10].
With VLas the plunger gate voltage, we tune the sys-
tem to a single hole dot (the electron and hole spectra in
BLG have so far been found identical) with strong dot-
lead tunnel coupling, allowing for the observation of the
Kondo effect [10, 43][sketched in Fig. 3(a), see Supple-
mental Materials S1 [37] for details].
The Coulomb blockade in a QD [Fig. 3(b,i)] can be
lifted by the Kondo effect [Fig. 3(b,ii)] [43–48], allow-
ing for finite conductance G: the unpaired spin (valley)
state in the dot attracts a cloud of carriers with oppo-
site spins (valleys) to the strongly coupled lead, assisting
spin- (valley-) flip co-tunneling events [10]. For energy
conservation, the energy gained by the carrier escaping
the dot equates to the energy lost by the carrier enter-
ing simultaneously from the lead. Therefore, a conduc-
tance resonance around zero VSDindicates the existence
of degenerate N-particle ground states with different spin
(valley) quantum numbers—as observed in the Coulomb
diamonds in Fig. S1 for one, two, and three holes. The
absence of this resonance for four holes confirms the for-
mation of a singly degenerate full shell with paired spins
and valleys. At finite VSD, co-tunnelings with excited
states become possible [Fig. 3(b,iii)]. Conductance reso-
nances occur when e|VSD|=µN,ES−µN,GS := ∆E, i.e.
when the bias provides exactly the energy difference be-
tween the states. From the Coulomb diamonds in Fig. S1
we obtain charging energies ≈4 meV, larger than the en-
ergy scales in the following discussions.
Fixing VLfor three and four holes (See Supplemental
Materials. S1 [37] for the corresponding Coulomb dia-
monds and the chosen VL), we apply external in-plane
B∥and out-of-plane B⊥field which shift the energies
of spin and valley states. Slopes of conductance reso-
nances in B-fields offer information on the character of
the states: a slope of ±gs(±gv), corresponds to a spin-
(valley-) flip co-tunneling transition between the ground
state and an excited state with different spin (valley)
numbers ∆ σz=±1 (∆τz=±1). For the discussion
of the Kondo effect, we label the single QD states ex-
clusively with spin and valley numbers for compactness.
We discuss for positive VSDonly, though the physics is
equivalent for negative VSD.
With these rules in mind, we first look at conduc-
tance maps Fig. 3(c,i) for three particles in in-plane mag-
netic field, which couple only to spins but not to valleys.
We thus see resonance 1 at zero-bias corresponding to
valley-flip co-tunnelings, indicating the ground-state val-
ley degeneracy τz=±1/2. Resonance 2 splits off from
1 with slope + gs≈2, indicating spin-flip co-tunnelings
and thus the zero-field spin degeneracy of the ground
state σz=±1/2. Starting from 0 .7 mV at B∥= 0, res-5

States are labeled with total spin (valley) numbers σ(τ), and projected spin (valley) numbers σz(τz).
onance 3 shows a slope of −gs≈2, indicating spin-flip
co-tunnelings between the ground state with σz=−1/2
and an excited state with lower spin number. This maxi-
mally spin-polarized three-particle state with σz=−3/2
appears as an excited state at 0 .7 meV as it requires con-
tributions of an excited orbital level. This state is also re-
sponsible for lifting the (1 ,2)→(0,3) and (2 ,2)→(1,3)
spin blockade [Fig. 2(b,iii and vi), squares, also sketched
in Fig. 2(a,iii)]. This excited state becomes the ground
state at B∥>7 T. Co-tunneling events then arise from
this state.
In out-of-plane field [Fig. 3(d)], as gv≫gswe resolve
mainly valley splitting. The non-resolved spin-multiplet
bundles are colored gray together. Being a zero-bias res-
onance in B∥, resonance 1 splits off in B⊥with gv≈40,
corresponding to valley-flip co-tunnelings. We observe a
‘focusing’ effect of resonance 2 becoming the narrowest at
0.35±0.10 T, arising from the competition between the
zero-field splitting ∆ SO[10, 12] and the Zeeman splitting,
changing the ground state from σz= 1/2;τz=−1/2
toσz=−1/2;τz=−1/2. With gs= 2 we estimate
∆SO≈40±10µeV, slightly lower than that reported
for one-particle states [5, 10, 12]. Starting from 1 .5 mV
atB⊥= 0, resonance 5 with g∼40 corresponds tovalley-flip co-tunnelings between the ground state with
τz=−1/2 and an excited state with lower valley number
τz=−3/2. Since there exists no resonance with a slope
ofg∼ −40 starting from 0 .7 mV at B⊥= 0, we conclude
that the σz=−3/2 excited states contain no τz=−3/2
states. At B⊥>0.7 T, the valley-polarized τz=−3/2
state becomes the ground state. From there resonance
6 with gs= +2 corresponds to spin-flip co-tunnelings
between the τz=−3/2;σz±1/2 states. Resonances
5’, and 7 with slopes g∼+40 correspond to valley-flip
co-tunnelings of the τz=−3/2 ground state with the
spin-doublet of σ= 1/2;τ= 1/2, τz=−1/2, and with
the quadruplet bundle of σ= 3/2;τ= 1/2, τz=−1/2,
respectively.
It is worth noting that the three-particle σz= 3/2
state is lower in energy ( ∼0.7 meV) than the τz= 3/2
state ( ∼1.5 meV), similar to the two-particle case [11, 13]
where, counter-intuitively, the spin-triplet ( σ= 1) is the
ground state while the valley-triplet ( τ= 1) is the excited
state.
We now turn our attention to four-particle states in
out-of-plane field. Intuitively, the four-hole ground state
is a full shell with degeneracy of 1, and indeed no zero-
bias peak occurs at zero field. Starting at 1 mV, res-6
onance 1 shows gv∼ −40, corresponding to valley-flip
co-tunnelings between the full shell and an excited state
with τz=−1. This state becomes the ground state at
B⊥>0.5 T. At B⊥>1.1 T, a fully valley-polarized state
with τz=−2 becomes the ground state. Resonances 2
and 2’ arise from co-tunnelings between the τz=−2 and
theτz=−1 states. Tracing resonance 2 back to B⊥= 0,
we obtain energy of the τz=−2 excited state ≈3 meV.
The excited states are higher in energy due to involve-
ment of higher orbital levels. Their energy deduced from
the Kondo measurements agree well with that deduced
from lifting of the double-dot blockade (Fig. 2), which
also agrees qualitatively with the calculated orbital lev-
els [14, 15].
As the ground states change in B-field, the double-
dot Pauli blockade also changes in nature. For charge
degeneracies (1 ,2)–(0 ,3), (1 ,3)–(0 ,4), and (2 ,2)–(1 ,3),
we study conductance along the detuning-axis of bias-
triangles in B⊥(see Supplemental Materials S2 [37]).
The magneto-spectroscopy shows the evolution of Pauli
blockade in B⊥, and agrees with the suggested [Fig. 2(a)]
and demonstrated [Fig. 3(c–e)] N-particle state spectra.
To conclude, we established three- and four-particle
state spectra in BLG QDs by examining their magnetic
field dependence with the Kondo effect. By discussing
the relevant N-particle states and inspecting the double-
dot bias-triangle measurements between a multitude of
charge configurations, we reveal the Pauli blockade cata-
logue for BLG QDs as summarized in Fig. 1(c,i), notably
richer and intriguingly different compared to the canon-
ical spin-blockade [23] [Fig. 1(c,ii)]. The rich BLG state
spectra and Pauli blockade catalogue offer an abundance
of novel qubit operational positions, allowing for im-
proved qubit manipulation and control exploiting unique
spin and valley properties.

S1. METHODS
The device is fabricated as described in Ref. [1–5].
A false-colored AFM image of the sample is shown in
Fig. 1(b,i). Stacked with the dry-transfer technique [6],
the van der Waals heterostructure lies on a silicon chip
with 285 nm surface SiO 2. The stack consists of a bot-
tom graphite back gate, and on top of it a BLG flake
encapsulated in 38 nm thick bottom and 20 nm thick top
hBN flakes. Ohmic edge contacts with Cr and Au of
10 and 60 nm thickness, respectively, are evaporated af-
ter etching through the top hBN flake with reactive ion
etching. A pair of 5 nm thick Cr, 20 nm thick Au split
gates [gray in Fig. 1(b,i)] are deposited on top, defining
a 1µm long, 100 nm wide channel. Separated by a layer
of 30 nm thick amorphous Al 2O3grown by atomic layer
deposition, finger gates [red and blue in Fig. 1(b,i)] of
20 nm in width, and 5 nm Cr and 20 nm Au in thickness,
lie across the channel. Neighboring finger gates are sep-
arated by 75 nm from center to center.
In BLG, a band-gap is formed near the K±valleys
when applying a displacement field perpendicular to the
sheet of BLG [7–9], where the size of the gap increases
with the strength of the displacement field. With dual-
gating, we have control over both the size of the gap, and
the doping, in the gated region.
Our double electron quantum dots studied in the first
part of this work are defined electrostatically in the same
BLG device with the method described in Refs. [3, 5]. We
apply a positive global graphite back-gate voltage VBG=
5 V, tuning the whole sheet of BLG into an n-doped
regime. With negative voltages VSG=−3.645 V ,−3.53 V
applied to the split gates, we open up a band gap under-
neath the split gates, and simultaneously tune the Fermi
energy EFinto the middle of the gap. Thus we confine
the current flow ISDto be only along this n-type 1D-
channel. With another layer of gates deposited on top, we
gain control locally over the potential landscape within
this channel. As shown in Fig. 1(b,ii), we use the three
barrier gates (blue) LB, MB, and RB to tune the region
underneath them into the gap, forming our left, middle,
and right barriers. The barrier gate voltages control the
location of the Fermi energy EFin the gap, and hence the
strength of the barriers. In general, here the tunnel cou-
pling decreases with more negative barrier gate voltages,
until the voltages are negative enough for the formation
ofp-type dots underneath the barriers. The gates L and
R serve as plunger gates for the electron dot L and R,
respectively. With more negative plunger gate voltages
VLandVR, we can deplete the electron dots cleanly to
the last carrier.
Our single-hole quantum dot, strongly coupled to the
leads studied in the second part of this work, is de-
fined electrostatically in the same BLG device with the
method described in Refs. [4, 10]. We apply a positive
FIG. S1. Coulomb diamonds near the regime of the Kondo ef-
fect measurements for (a) three-particle measurements shown
in Fig. 3(c,d), and (b) four-particle measurements shown in
Fig. 3(e). Stable hole occupancies are labelled in the dia-
monds. The red dotted lines mark the plunger gate voltages at
which the three- and four-hole measurements shown in Fig. 3
in the main text are taken.
global graphite back-gate voltage VBG= 3.7 V, tuning
the whole sheet of BLG into an n-doped regime. With
negative voltages VSG=−2.85 V applied to the split
gates, we open up a bandgap underneath the split gates,
and simultaneously tune the Fermi energy EFinto the
middle of the gap. Thus we confine the current flow ISD
to be only along this n-type 1D-channel. With another
layer of gates deposited on top, we gain control locally
over the potential landscape within this channel. We use
the plunger gate voltage VLto tune the region beneath
gate L into a p-type regime. The naturally forming p-n
junctions, therefore, become tunnel barriers of this single
hole dot formed underneath gate L. With barrier gates
LB and MB we can shift the bands underneath them in
energy, and as a result, tune the width of the p-njunc-
tion and hence the tunnel coupling [4]. More positive
barrier gate voltages give rise to narrower p-njunctions,
and hence a larger and more strongly coupled dot to the
leads. For the measurements demonstrated in this work,
theVLB=VMBis set to 5 .6655 V for Fig. 3(c), 5 .6702 V
for (d), and 4 .8141 V for (e).
The plunger gate voltage VLis set to be in the Coulomb
blockaded region for three holes in (c) VL=−8.77 V,
and in (d) VL=−8.78 V, and for four holes in (e) VL=
−8.515 V. They are chosen to be in the middle of the
Coulomb blockade diamond with the respective number
of holes, as shown in Fig. S1 (red dotted lines).10
The measurements are performed in a dilution refrig-
erator with base temperature of ∼100 mK.
S2. MAGNETOSPECTROSCOPY ALONG
DOUBLE-DOT DETUNING-AXIS
In this section we show magnetospectroscopy measure-
ments along the detuning-axis of the double dot bias tri-
angles. The line cuts were always taken from the base to
the tip of the triangle for the lower one of the pair of bias
triangles (electron transport cycle). We apply an out-
of-plane magnetic field B⊥and examine the evolution of
the conductance along the δ-axis. The resulting detuning
(plotted as VR) v.s. B⊥maps are shown in Fig. S2(i),
Fig. S3(i), and Fig. S4(i), for (1 ,2)–(0 ,3), (1 ,3)–(0 ,4),
and (2 ,2)–(1 ,3) charge degeneracies, respectively, where
in (a) we apply negative bias VSDsuch that the elec-
trons travel from right to the left dot, and in (b) we
apply positive bias VSD, and electrons travel from left to
the right dot. The corresponding calculated transitions
are labeled with initial and final states in (ii), with non-
blocked (NB), valley-blocked (VB), spin-blocked (SB),
and spin-and-valley-blocked (V+SB) colored in purple,
blue, green, and yellow, respectively. The δhere is cal-
culated from the plunger gate voltages VRandVL. Rele-
vant non-blocked, valley-blocked, spin-blocked, and spin-
and-valley-blocked transitions, are sketched in straight,
dashed, dotted, and dash-dotted lines, respectively. The
parameters for the state energy calculations are listed
in the respective figure captions. The analysis follows
closely to what has been performed in Ref. [3] around
the (1 ,1)–(0 ,2) charge degeneracy.
When B⊥is applied, the states shift in energies due to
spins and valleys coupling to B⊥with gsandgv. Spin
(valley) blocked transitions require spin (valley) flips,
hence they show up in the δv.s.B⊥measurements as
lines with slopes of gsorgv. Note, however, that we
have for simplicity assumed that the left and the right
dots are the same, i.e., the valley g-factor gvis the same,
and the same excited states occur at the same energies.
This is not necessarily true as both of these quantities
depend upon the exact dot geometry and potential land-
scape [4, 11], though they are rather similar due to the
similar environments. As a result of the differences, a
non-blocked transition can also have a finite slope, and a
spin-blocked transition can have a slope that is not ex-
actly gs, arising from the difference of valley g-factor ∆ gv
in the two dots.
The baseline of the bias triangles at zero B⊥is defined
as zero-detuning δ= 0, when the electrochemical poten-
tial of the ground states of the initial and the final charge
configuration aligns. If this ground-state to ground-state
transition is prohibited by Pauli blockade, then current
is suppressed from this transition onward, until meeting
an excited state of the final charge configuration wherethe spin and valley quantum numbers match, lifting the
blockade [see Fig. 2(c)]. A kink of the baseline (and hence
a kink towards the edge of the bias window at large de-
tuning δ) therefore indicates a change in either of the
ground states of the initial and final charge configuration
— the ground states change because a more spin or val-
ley polarized state is lowered in energy by B⊥enough
to overcome its excited state energy at zero-field ∆ E.
Since the existence of Pauli blockade is always defined by
the possible transitions initiated from the ground state
of the initial charge configuration, we use vertical lines
to separate regions with these different ground states.
We characterize these transitions by the simple single-
particle state spectrum picture discussed in Fig. 2(a),
with experimentally demonstrated one-particle spectrum
in Refs. [10, 12], two-particle spectrum in Ref. [10, 13],
and with the three- and four-particle state spectra dis-
cussed in Fig. 3. We label the ground state to ground
state transitions [the ones closest to the initial charge
configurations, so the highest transitions for panels (a)
with a negative bias, and the lowest transitions for panels
(b) with positive bias], and if this transition is blocked,
we label the next available transitions involving excited
states in the final charge configuration that would lift
this blockade.
For three and four particle states involving excited or-
bital levels, for simplicity we label these states with only
the unpaired spin and valley numbers, e.g., ↓K−↓K+↓
K−
N=3becomes ↓↓↓K−
N=3. To avoid confusion between
three- and one-particle states and for consistency with
the labeling in Fig. 2(a), we maintain the labeling for the
three particle ground states: the first two particles have
paired spin and valleys, and the last particle characterizes
the unpaired spin and valley, e.g., ↓K−↑K+↑K−
N=3.
Note also, that we transfer from labeling the three and
four particle states with their quantum numbers in Fig. 3
to writing directly the spin and valley projections. For
example, the state labeled ↓↓↓K−
N=3here, was labeled
|σz=−3/2;τz=−1/2⟩in Fig. 3.
(1,2)–(0,3) charge degeneracy
For (0 ,3)→(1,2), the low-magnetic field (0 ,3) ground
state is (0 ,↓K−↑K+↑K−), so the ground-state
to ground-state transition to the (1 ,2) ground state
(↓K−,T−
sSv) is spin-blocked. However, this blockade
is quickly lifted in energy within a Zeeman splitting
by accessing the (1 ,2) excited state ( ↓K−,T+
sSv). At
B⊥>0.25 T the (0 ,3) ground state changes to (0 ,↑
K−↓K+↓K−), but transition to (1 ,2) ground state
remains spin-blocked, lifted by the Zeeman split (1 ,2) ex-
cited state ( ↓K−, T0
sSv). At large enough B⊥>0.45 T
the (1 ,2) ground state changes to ( ↓K−,SsT−
v), so the
transition to it is now valley-blocked, until the same
(1,2) excited state as before lifts this blockade. We thus11

see a region of suppressed conductance, labeled VB. At
B⊥>0.85 T the (0 ,3) ground state becomes the valley-
polarized (0 ,↓K−K−K−), so transition to the (1 ,2)
ground state ( ↓K−,SsT−
v) is allowed, and hence the cur-
rent recovers.
For (1 ,2)→(0,3), the low-magnetic field (1 ,2) ground
state is ( ↓K−,T−
sSv), so to the (0 ,3) ground state
(0,↓K−↑K+↑K−) (or (0 ,↑K−↓K+↓K−) for
B⊥>0.25 T) we first encounter a spin-blocked region,
lifted by the (0 ,3) excited state (0 ,↓↓↓K−) occurring at
∆E= 0.7 meV, agreeing with the ∆ Eobserved in the
three-particle Kondo measurement in Fig. 3(c). At high
enough B⊥>0.45 T the (1 ,2) ground state changes into
(↓K−,SsT−
v), so transition to the (0 ,3) ground state
(0,↑K−↓K+↓K−) now becomes valley-blocked, un-
til the (0 ,3) excited state (0 ,↓K−K−K−) at ∆ E=
2.0 meV lifting the valley blockade. This excited state
energy is also similar to that observed in Kondo mea-
surement, keeping the order that the spin-polarized state
is lower in energy than the valley-polarized state. At
larger B⊥>0.85 T, this valley-polarized three-particle
excited state is lowered enough in energy to become
the new three-particle ground state, and therefore the
(1,2)→(0,3) transitions are non-blocked thereon.
(1,3)–(0,4) charge degeneracy
For (0 ,4)→(1,3), we first start from the (0 ,4) ground
state being the full shell, so its transition to the (1 ,3)
ground state ( ↓K−,↓K−↑K+↑K−) (or ( ↓K−,↑
K−↓K+↓K−) atB⊥>0.25 T) is valley-blocked. This
blockade is lifted when the valley-split (1 ,3) states be-
come available, such that the (0 ,4) full shell can be split
into corresponding (1 ,3) states. At large enough B⊥>
0.55 T the half valley-polarized (0 ,4) state (0 ,↓↓K−K−)
is lowered enough in energy and becomes the ground
state, transition to the (1 ,3) ground state is therefore
not blocked and current recovers over the entire 1 meV
bias window. At even larger B⊥>0.8 T the fully valley-
polarized (0 ,4) state (0 ,↓↓K−K−K−K−) becomes the
ground state, hence transition to the (1 ,3) ground state
is valley blocked. Eventually the (1 ,3) ground state also
changes to the valley-polarized ( ↓K−,↓K−K−K−),
fully lifting the blockade and recovering the current. The
locations of the kinks in B⊥marking the changes of four-
particle ground states, agree well with that shown by the
four-particle Kondo effect in Fig. 3(d).
For (1 ,3)→(0,4), we begin first with the (1 ,3) ground
state ( ↓K−,↓K−↑K+↑K−) such that transition
to the (0 ,4) ground state of a full shell in the right
dot is valley-blocked, until meeting the (0 ,4) half valley-
polarized excited state (0 , K−K−). When the (1 ,3)
ground state changes to ( ↓K−,↑K−↓K+↓K−) at
B⊥>0.35 T, the ground-state to ground-state transi-
tion is spin and valley blocked, lifted by a similar (0 ,4)excited state (0 ,↓↓K−K−). This half valley-polarized
excited state exists at an energy of ∆ E≈1 meV, agree-
ing with that observed in the four-particle Kondo effect
in Fig. 3(d). Another horizontal resonance appears in
the non-blocked region at even higher energies, corre-
sponding to another (0 ,↓↓K−K−) state with an excited
orbital state. The excited orbital state is ≈0.5 meV
higher in energy than the lower orbital state with the
same spin and valley configuration. Eventually, this half
valley-polarized state (0 ,↓↓K−K−) becomes the (0 ,4)
ground state and current recovers in the entire bias win-
dow. At higher B⊥>0.8 T the fully valley-polarized
(0,4) state becomes the new ground state, and transi-
tions from the (1 ,3) (↓K−,↑K−↓K+↓K−) is again
valley blocked, until at even higher B⊥>1.1 T, where
the (1 ,3) ground state also changes to the valley polarized
(↓K−,↓K−K−K−), lifting the blockade and recovering
the current.
(2,2)–(1,3) charge degeneracy
For (1 ,3)→(2,2), we start with the (1 ,3) ground
state ( ↓K−,↓K−↑K+↑K−), and its transition to
the (2 ,2) ground state (T−
sSv,T−
sSv) is spin and val-
ley blocked. Only within a Zeeman splitting energy
though, the (2 ,2) excited state (T0
sSv,T0
sSv) will be-
come accessible, such that we have only valley block-
ade. The blockade is completely lifted when the two-
particle excited state in one of the two dots becomes
available such that we have access to (S sT−
v,T0
sSv). Be-
cause the spin singlet-triplet energy splitting ESTin the
two dots can be slightly different (it depends on the dot
geometry and band gap etc. [11, 14, 15], it can result
in two roughly horizontal resonances separated in energy
by|EST,L−EST,R|. At higher energy, we have access
to the two-particle orbital anti-symmetric excited states:
spin-triplets valley-triplets. These states are higher in
energy by ∆ ASfrom the spin-singlet valley-triplets. At
detuning energies EST,L/R+ ∆ AS,L/R, we have four ad-
ditional resonances corresponding to (1,3) ground state
aligning with (2,2) states: (T0
sT−
v,TsSv), (S sT−
v,TsT0
v),
(TsT0
v,SsT−
v) and (T sSv,T0
sT−
v). At even higher energies
EST,L/R+ ∆ AS,L+ ∆ AS,R, we have two additional hori-
zontal resonances corresponding to alignment with (2,2)
states with orbitally anti-symmetric states in both dots:
(T0
sT−
v,TsT0
v), (T sT0
v,T0
sT−
v). From the measurement,
we can estimate EST≈0.5 meV, ∆ AS≈0.5 meV.
At large enough B⊥>0.25 T, the (1 ,3) ground state
changes to ( ↓K−,↑K−↓K+↓K−) inB⊥, such that a
different two-particle spin-triplet, namely (S sT−
v,T−
sSv),
is required to lift the blockade. Meanwhile, the (2 ,2)
ground state also becomes (S sT−
v,SsT−
v), and, transition
from the (1 ,3) ground state ( ↓K−,↑K−↓K+↓K−)
is spin and valley blocked. This is partly lifted upon
hitting a (2 ,2) fully polarized excited state 0 .3 meV13

above the spin-singlets, a reasonable size as compared
to that discussed in Ref. [11], such that we have only
valley blockade and current is suppressed but finite.
The blockade is fully lifted upon the (2 ,2) excited state
(SsT−
v,T−
sSv). At large B⊥>0.9 T the valley-polarized
(↓K−,↓K−K−K−) becomes the (1 ,3) ground state,
and transition from it to the (2 ,2) ground state be-
comes valley-blocked, which is lifted by the spin-polarized
valley-polarized two-particle state.
For (2 ,2)→(1,3), we start with the (2 ,2) ground
state (T−
sSv,T−
sSv). The transition to the (1 ,3) ground
state ( ↓K−,↓K−↑K+↑K−) is spin and val-
ley blocked, which is partially lifted when hitting the
(1,3) excited state ( ↓K−,↓K−↑K+↓K+) where
it is then only spin blocked. When hitting the spin-
polarized (1 ,3) excited state ( ↓K−,↓↓↓K−) the tran-
sitions are then valley-blocked. Only when hitting the
other valley branch of this spin-polarized (1 ,3) state
(↓K−,↓↓↓K+) the transition is fully lifted, recover-
ing the current. At B⊥>0.25 T the (2 ,2) ground state
changes into (S sT−
v,SsT−
v), hence transition to the (1 ,3)
ground state ( ↓K−,↑K−↓K+↓K−) is spin and
valley blocked, until hitting the (1 ,3) (↓K−,↓K−↑
K+↑K−) state, thereon it is valley blocked only. The
blockade is fully lifted eventually by the valley-polarized
(1,3) excited state ( ↓K−,↑K−K−K−). Its spin-down
branch ( ↓K−,↓K−K−K−) eventually becomes the
(1,3) ground state at B⊥>0.9 meV, and transition fromthe (2 ,2) ground state to it is first spin-blocked, but then
completely lifted by the spin up branch.
