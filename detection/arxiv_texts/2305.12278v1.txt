We demonstrate how using two qubits can drastically improve the estimation of environment
parameters as compared to using only a single qubit. The two q ubits are coupled to a common
harmonic oscillatorenvironment, and the properties of the environment are imprinted upon the
dynamics of the two qubits. The reduced density matrix of onl y one of these qubits contains
a decoherence factor as well as an additional factor taking i nto account the indirect interaction
induced between the qubits due to the interaction with their common environment. This additional
factor can drastically improve the estimation of the enviro nment parameters, as quantiﬁed by the
quantum Fisher information. In particular, we investigate the estimation of the cutoﬀ frequency,
the coupling strength, and the temperature using our two-qu bit scheme as compared to simply using
a single qubit. For super-Ohmic environments in particular , one can improve the precision of the
estimates by orders of magnitude.
I. INTRODUCTION
Open quantum systems have attracted great interest
over the past few decades as they have an important
role in the development of modern quantum technologies
[1, 2]. In order to understand quantum dynamics prop-
erly, the eﬀect of the environment must be taken into ac-
count as every quantum system inevitably interacts with
its environment, leading to decoherence [3, 4]. To under-
stand the eﬀect of decoherence, one must know param-
eters such as the system-environment coupling strength
and the temperature. One useful method is to consider
a quantum probe (a small and controllable quantum sys-
tem) interacting with its environment [5–22]. Once the
dynamicsoftheprobeareobtained, measurementsonthe
probe allow us to estimate several properties associated
with the environment. The precision of these estimates
is encapsulated in the quantum Fisher information (QFI)
[23–32]. In order to minimize the error in the estimates,
as dictated by the Cramer-Raobound, one needs to max-
imize the QFI.
To date, many eﬀorts have been put forward to esti-
mate the environment parameters by using single-qubit
and two-qubit quantum probes [8, 14, 20, 21, 33]. In par-
ticular, the focus has been on estimating the parameters
of a harmonic oscillator environment, taking the initial
probe-environment state to be a simple product state.
It has been argued that the use of a two-qubit probe is
not really beneﬁcial as compared to a single-qubit probe
[14]. By using a diﬀerent scheme, in this paper, we argue
on the contrary. Rather than performing measurements
on two qubits to deduce the environment parameters, we
show that the QFI can be drastically increased if we cou-
ple two qubits to the common environment, but perform
measurements on only one of them. In other words, we
trace out one of the qubits. The common environment
induces an indirect interaction between the two qubits,
∗adam.zaman@lums.edu.pkandit isthis indirectinteraction(that depends ontheen-
vironment parameters) that leads to the increase in the
QFI.Moreover,ifthe environmentissuchthattheprobe-
environment interaction is strong, then the assumption
of weak probe-environment is questionable and the ini-
tial probe-environment correlations can become impor-
tant [34–64]. In this regard, it has been recently shown
that these initial probe-environmentcorrelationscanalso
drastically increase the QFI [65]. In this spirit, we also
taketheinitial correlationsintoaccounttoshowthat, be-
sides the indirect interaction, the initial correlations can
further increasethe QFI. Note that while we do trace out
one qubit, we still consider our probe to be a two-qubit
quantum probe as the presence of the second qubit is
essential to drastically increase the QFI.
We start by analyzing the dynamics of the two-qubit
quantum probe interacting with a common harmonic os-
cillator environment. Assuming relaxation timescales to
be much longer than the dephasing timescales, we ignore
dissipation eﬀects, that is, we consider pure dephasing.
We allow our system and the environment interact each
otheruntilthey achieveajoint thermalequilibriumstate.
Aprojectivemeasurementisthenperformedontheprobe
to prepare the initial probe state. Thereafter, the two-
qubit probe interacts with the environment. We then
perform a partial trace over the environment as well as
over the second qubit to obtain a 2 ×2 density matrix
describing the dynamics of only qubit only. This density
matrix contains the eﬀect of decoherence, the initial cor-
relations, as well as the indirect interaction between the
two qubits. With this density matrix at hand, we work
out the QFI, which is obviously a function of the interac-
tion time between the probe and the environment. The
idea then is to choose this interaction time such that the
QFI is maximized. We conclusively show that the corre-
sponding maximum QFI can be drastically greater than
the QFI obtained with a single-qubit probe.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we
present a detailed derivation of the reduced dynamics
for our probe, both with and without initial correlations.
In the next section, we compute the QFI and present re-2
sults for the estimation of various environment parame-
terssuchasthecutoﬀfrequency ωc, thecouplingstrength
G, and the temperature Trespectively. In Sec. IV, we
discuss the measurements that need to be performed in
order to obtain the best estimates. Finally, in Sec. V,
we summarize our work. The appendices contain the de-
tailed derivation of the dynamics.
II. THE MODEL

monic oscillator environment. We label the two qubits 1
and 2. The dynamics of our two-qubit system can be de-
scribed by the Hamiltonian (we take /planckover2pi1= 1 throughout)

tion operators (we have dropped the zero point energy
for convenience), while HSEcorresponds to the probe-
environment interaction. To obtain the dynamics of the
two qubits, it is convenient to ﬁrst transform our Hamil-
tonian into an interaction picture via the unitary opera-
torU0(t) =e−i(HE+HS)t. We then obtain

A. Factorized Initial State
To make further progress, we now assume that the to-
tal state is a product state. In other words, denoting the
initial state of the two qubits as ρS(0) and the total state
asρ(0), we have
ρ(0) =ρS(0)⊗ρE, (8)
whereρE=e−βHE

Note that Γ( t) describes decoherence, while ∆( t) de-
scribes the indirect interaction between the qubits due
to the interaction with the common environment. We
take the initial state to be ‘pointing up’ along the x-
axis, that is, ρS(0) =|+,+/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{t+,+|,whereσx|+/an}bracketri}ht=|+/an}bracketri}ht.
Also, the eﬀect of the environment on the system is en-
capsulated by the spectral density of environment J(ω).
This function eﬀectively converts a sum over the en-
vironment modes to an integral via/summationtext

Note that we have added the subscript ‘un’ to em-

Γun(t) into temperature-dependent and temperature-
independent parts, that is, Γ un(t) = Γvac(t)+Γth(t) [52].

B. Correlated Initial State
We now consider preparing the initial state of the two
qubits in the initial state |ψ/an}bracketri}ht=|+,+/an}bracketri}htvia a projective
measurement. The total system environmentinitial state
is then written as
ρ(0) =|ψ/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tψ|⊗/an}bracketle{tψ|e−βH|ψ/an}bracketri}ht

From this state, we get the state describing the dynamics
of the ﬁrst spin system by taking a partial trace over the
second spin system, as we did in the uncorrelated case.

(15)
whereξ(t) =ω0t+χ(t). Again, Γ( t) incorporates the
decoherence eﬀect of the environment, while ∆( t) cap-
tures the indirect interaction. Moreover, the eﬀect of the
initial correlations emerges as an eﬀective level shift χ(t)
as well as a modiﬁcation of the decoherence factor. In
particular, the decoherence factor is now

III. QUANTUM FISHER INFORMATION
With thedynamicsathand, both withandwithoutthe
initial correlations, we now move to calculate the quan-
tum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI quantiﬁes the
precision with which a general environment parameter x
can be estimated [14]. It can be shown that the QFI is
related to the Cramer-Rao bound - the greater the QFI,
the greater our precision of the estimate. The general
expression for the QFI is given by

where|εn/an}bracketri}htis thentheigenstate of our reduced single
qubit state and ρnis the corresponding eigenvalue. For
the evaluated single qubit 2 ×2 matrix, it is straightfor-
ward to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenstates. We
ﬁnd thatρ1=1

4e−2Γ(sin∆∂x∆+cos∆∂xΓ)2.
Calculating also the derivatives of the eigenstates, and
substituting in Eq. (17), the QFI comes out to be
FQ(x) =(sin∆∂x∆+cos∆∂xΓ)2
e2Γ−cos2∆+cos2∆(∂xχ)2
e2Γ.
(18)
This expression reduces to the expression presented in
Ref. [65] for a single qubit case by setting ∆ = 0. Eq.
(18) gives the QFI for the case where we take the initial
correlations into account. If we start with the simple
product, then we can obtain the QFI by setting χ= 0
and replacing Γ by Γ un.
Before moving on to concrete examples of estimating
the environment parameters, let us note that the addi-
tionoftheindirectqubit-qubitinteractionappearshighly
promising in increasing the QFI, in particular due to the
presence of the sin∆ ∂x∆ term in the QFI.
A. Estimation of the cutoﬀ frequency of the
environment
As the ﬁrst example of the application of our expres-
sion of the QFI (see Eq. 18), we now look in detail at the1234500.050.1

while the dotted, red curve ignores these eﬀects. We have
takenω0= 1 and the rest of the parameters are G= 0.01,
s= 0.5, and the temperature T= 0. The inset shows the
optimized QFI if we simply use a single qubit or spin (without
any second qubit), both with (solid, blue curve) and without
correlations (dashed, magenta curve). The parameters used
are the same as the main ﬁgure.

FIG. 3. (Color online) Comparison of the optimized QFI for

the solid black (with initial correlations) and dashed blac k

qubit scheme while the red circles (with correlations) and d ot-
ted red (without correlations) show the optimized QFI for th e
single-qubit case. In the top-left inset, the optimized QFI is
plotted with (solid blue) and without (magenta dashed) cor-
relations with G= 0.1 for the single-qubit case while in the

out (red dashed) correlations at G= 0.1 for the two-qubit

for diﬀerent values of ωc, and thereby note the maximum
value of QFI for each value of ωc. We can then investi-
gate the behavior of this optimal QFI as a function of the
cutoﬀ frequency. This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 1.
The main ﬁgure shows the typical behavior of the QFI
for estimating the cutoﬀ frequency for a sub-Ohmic en-
vironment using our two-qubit scheme, both with and
without including the eﬀect of the initial correlations. It
isclearthat inthis weakcouplingstrengthregime, theef-
fect of the initial correlations is insigniﬁcant, as expected
since the black, solid curve overlaps with the red dotted
curve. The inset shows the optimized QFI if we sim-
ply use a single qubit interacting with the environment
with the same set of parameters. What is most notable
in this ﬁgure is the drastic increase of the QFI with our
two-qubit scheme as compared to using a single qubit -
it is a three orders of magnitude increase, which demon-
strates in a remarkable manner the advantage of using
our two-qubit scheme. The increase is simply because of
the indirect qubit-qubit interaction (the ∆ term). Inter-
estingly, if we increase the coupling strength G, our two-
qubit scheme improves the QFI, although the increase is
not as drastic as the in the case of weak coupling (see
Fig. 2) - the increased decoherence leads to the smaller
values of the QFI. We also investigated an Ohmic envi-
ronment in Fig. 3. For strong coupling, we notice the
overlap of red circles (using the simple single qubit probe
with correlations included) and the solid black curve (us-
ing our two-qubit scheme with the eﬀect of the correla-
tions included), thereby indicating that the two schemes
perform similarly for strong coupling with an Ohmic en-
vironment. However, the situation drastically changes1234500.5

FIG. 4. (Color online) We now consider a super-Ohmic en-

bottom plot shows the QFI with (solid black) and without
(dashed red) correlations with the two-qubit scheme. The in -
set simply zooms in on the QFI for small values of time to
illustrate the QFI with and without correlations. Other pa-
rameters used are the same as Fig. 1 except that now we have
G= 2.
for weaker coupling. As one can see from the inset, the
QFI with our two-qubit scheme keeps on increasing as
the qubits interact with their environment - the decoher-
ence is now smaller, and the indirect interaction leads to
a buildup of the information gained about the environ-
ment. Ontheotherhand, theQFIobtainedusingasingle
qubit probe is bounded. Similar behavior is seen with a
super-Ohmic environment (see Fig. 4), where again the
indirect inter-qubit interaction (the ∆ term) plays a vi-
tal role in increasing the QFI. In fact, now the buildup
of QFI with the two-qubit scheme persists even in the
strong coupling regime.
B. Estimation of system-environment coupling
strength
We now consider estimating the coupling strength G.
We again use the expression given in Eq. (18) and opti-
mize it over the interaction time to get optimized QFI.6

scheme with the QFI obtained using a single-qubit probe
for a sub-Ohmic environment. Results are illustrated in

mized QFI versus the coupling strength Gusing a single
qubit probe both with and without incorporating the ef-
fect of the initial correlations - these are shown with the

tively. We have also shown the QFI with our two-qubit012345610-310-210-1100101

scheme, both with (solid, black curve) and without (the
asterisk markers) including the initial correlations. At
least three points should be noted here. First, if we ig-
nore the initial correlations, then there is little diﬀerence
between the two schemes. Second, the role of the initial
correlation is, in general, very important. Third, with
both indirect interactions and the initial correlations ac-
countedfor, thereisadrasticincreasein theQFI.Follow-
ing the same color scheme and parameters used in Fig.
5, we demonstrate the optimized QFI in an Ohmic envi-
ronments= 1 as well (see Fig. 6). In this environment,
while the QFI is lower as compared to the sub-Ohmic
environment, the beneﬁt of using our two-qubit scheme
is still evident.
The advantage of our two-qubit scheme becomes even
more evident, as before, with super-Ohmic environments
(see Fig. 4). Once again, the QFI generally keeps on
increasing as we increase the interaction time (see the
bottom ﬁgure in Fig. 7) for our two-qubit scheme. If
we compare this with the results obtained using a single
qubit probe with (solid blue curve) or without (magenta
dashed curve) correlations (see the top plot), we see that
the QFI for the single qubit probe is far smaller.7

(s= 0.5) environment respectively. Here we have ωc= 5
andG= 1. The inset follows the same parameters and color
scheme but for the single qubit probe.
C. Estimation of Temperature
We now consider the estimation of temperature us-
ing a single qubit probe, as well as using our two-qubit
scheme, for sub-Ohmic, Ohmic, and super-Ohmic envi-
ronments. Since temperature is not zero here, therefore
Γcorr(t) and Γ th(t) are no longer zero. Γ corr(t) can be
found analytically - its expression is given in Eq. (16)
- while Γ th(t) and its temperature derivative are found
numerically. We illustrate our results in Fig. 8. The key
point to note here is that the higher temperatures mean
that the decoherence factor is greatly enhanced. This
enhancement eﬀectively washes out the advantage of us-
ing our two-qubit scheme, so that the quantum Fisher
information with a single-qubit probe and our two-qubit
scheme are quantitatively similar.
IV. OPTIMAL MEASUREMENT
Until now, we have found that by using our two-qubit
scheme, the QFI is substantially increased. The question
remains regarding which measurements need to be per-
formedinordertoobtainthismaximumQFI.Thiscanbe
answered by calculating the classical Fisher information
(CFI) for a particular measurement scheme; if the CFI
comesout to be equalto the QFI, then we havefound the
optimalmeasurementtobeperformed. Weguessthatthe
optimal measurements are projective measurements de-
scribed by the projection operators P1=|Ψ1/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tΨ1|and✶

Hereϕis an equatorial angle in the Bloch sphere. The
eﬀect of this measurement is encapsulated by the prob-
ability distribution P(k|x) withk= 1,2 andxis the
parameter we intend to estimate. For the discrete case,
the classical Fisher information is simply [66]

where P(k|x) is the conditional probability of getting

xdenotes the double deriva-
tive with respect to the parameter xthat is to be es-

ﬁnal state (15), we ﬁnd that (we have set Θ = χ+ω0t−ϕ
to show a more compact form)

We aim to maximize the classical Fisher information [see
Eq.(22)] overthe angle ϕ. Ifthis maximized CFI is equal
to the QFI, then we have found the optimal measure-
ment. If the eﬀect of initial correlations is not included,8
then it is clear that ϕ=ω0tis the optimal value. In this
case, the CFI reduces to the QFI, and so we have found
the optimal measurement. On the other hand, if χ/ne}ationslash= 0,
we can show that for
ϕ=ω0t+χ−tan−1/bracketleftBigg

(24)
the CFI reduces to the QFI. Again, this means that we
have managed to ﬁnd the optimal measurement. We fur-
ther support these claims by plotting both the QFI and
CFI while estimating environment’s cutoﬀ frequency ωc,
system-environment coupling strength Gand the envi-
ronment’s temperature T(see Fig. 9), where the overlap
betweentheCFIandtheQFIshowsthatwehavesuccess-
fully found the optimal measurements to be performed.
V. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have explored the use of a two-
qubit probe scheme to estimate the parameters of a har-
monic oscillator environment. The key idea is that both
qubits of the probe interact with the common environ-
ment. This common environment induces an indirect
interaction between the qubits. The dynamics of only
one of these qubits then depend sensitively on this in-
direct interaction on top of the decoherence induced by
the environment aswell asthe eﬀect ofthe initial system-
environment correlations. Consequently, we can expect
our two-qubit scheme to be better at estimating the envi-
ronmentparametersascomparedtosimply using asingle
qubit probe. We illustrated that this is indeed the case
by evaluating the optimal quantum Fisher information.
The increase in the quantum Fisher information can, in
fact, be dramatic.
Appendix A: Derivation of unitary operator
Our total unitary time-evolution operator for the
two-qubit systems can be written as as U(t) =
e−iHSte−iHEtUSE(t). To ﬁnd the unitary time evolu-
tion operator USE(t) corresponding to HSE(t), we use
the Magnus expansion
