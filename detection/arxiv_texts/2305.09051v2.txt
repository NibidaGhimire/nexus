Excitations in the form of quantized vortex rings are known to exist in superfluid4Heat energies
and momenta exceeding those of the Landau phonon-roton spectrum. They form a vortex branch of
elementary excitations spectrum which is disconnected from the Landau spectrum. Interference of
vortex ring excitations determines wake patterns due to uniformly traveling sources in bulk superfluid
at low speeds and pressures. The dispersion law of these excitations resembles that of gravity waves
on deep water with infrared wave number cutoff. As a result, vortex wake patterns featuring elements
of the Kelvin ship wake are predicted. Specifically, at lowest speeds the pattern with fully developed
transverse and diverging wavefronts is present. At intermediate speeds transverse wavefronts are
absent within a cone whose opening angle increases with the source velocity. At largest speeds only
diverging wavefronts confined within a cone whose opening angle decreases with the source velocity
are found. When experimentally observed, these changes in appearance of wake patterns serve as
indicators of the beginning part of the vortex branch of elementary excitations.
Landau’s insight that elementary excitations deter-
mine low-energy properties of many-body interacting sys-
tems is a paradigm of physics [1]. One such property
probing elementary excitations spectra that is common
to a number of physical systems is far-field wake patterns
representing response to uniformly traveling external dis-
turbances. Familiar examples include Mach waves due to
a supersonic projectile [2], Cherenkov radiation emitted
by a rapidly moving charge [3], and ship waves [4, 5],
all of which are examples of coherent generation of the
medium’s elementary excitations [6].
If the relevant elementary excitations are characterized
by the dispersion law ω(k) (where ωis the frequency and
kis the wave vector), a wake is present whenever there
is a wave mode whose phase velocity kω/k2(here k=|k|)
matches the projection of the velocity of the source vonto
the direction of radiation k/k[5, 6]. For a source mov-
ing with velocity v, this requires the existence of a wave
vector ksatisfying the Mach-Cherenkov-Landau (MCL)
resonant radiation condition
ω(k) =k·v≡kvcosφ. (1)
Here v=|v|andφis the angle between the vectors kand
v. Eq.(1) also describes the onset of Landau damping in
a plasma [7] and the breakdown of superfluidity [1].
When the excitation spectrum is linear,
ω=uk (2)
where uis the speed of sound (or light), the condition (1)
becomes cos φ=u/v. It can be satisfied only if u⩽v,
i.e. there is a finite critical velocity to generate a wake
pattern, vc=u.
Recently developed theory [8] makes it possible to
understand wake patterns due to excitations of general
isotropic dispersion laws. One of its applications includedwake patterns in superfluid4Heproduced by a small uni-
formly moving source or equivalently by a stationary ob-
stacle in the presence of background flow. The input to
the theory [8] is the excitation spectrum of4He.
The latter, as was recognized by Landau [9], is a super-
position of two continuous spectra: one corresponding to
potential flow and one, at a higher energy, corresponding
to vortex motion. The potential flow part of the spec-
trum known as the Landau phonon-roton spectrum has
the following properties [1, 9]:
For small wave numbers kthe elementary excitations
are phonons with a linear spectrum (2). As the wave
number increases, the function ω(k) =ω(k) reaches a
maximum, followed by a ”roton” minimum at some k0.
In the vicinity of k=k0it is customary to expand the
spectrum in powers of k−k0:
ω=∆
ℏ+ℏ(k−k0)2
2µ(3)
where ∆, µandk0are empirically known parameters de-
pending on the pressure [10] such as with good accuracy
the critical velocity to generate a wake pattern or equiv-
alently to destroy superfluidity is given by the slope of
the straight line connecting the origin ω(0) = 0 to the
roton minimum ω(k0) = ∆ /ℏ[8]:
vc=∆
ℏk0. (4)
The Landau critical roton velocity (4) has been at-
tained only in experiments with isotopically pure4Heat
a pressure exceeding 12 bars [11]. Likewise, roton wake
patterns predicted in Ref. [8] can be observed in their
pure form only at elevated pressure. The reason being
is that excitations of vortex nature, namely vortex rings
[12], play dominant role at low pressures. As a wholearXiv:2305.09051v2  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  17 Oct 20232
vortex rings have both definite momentum and energy,
and thus are a special type of elementary excitations [1].
Originally Landau argued [9] that the vortex motion
branch of the elementary excitations spectrum starts out
according to Eq.(3) with k0= 0. However experimental
data on second sound indicated that it is Eq.(3) that de-
scribes short-wavelength part of the potential flow branch
of the excitation spectrum; the roton does not represent
vortex motion as its group velocity is zero while vortex
ring cannot be at rest. A qualitative theory of the Lan-
dau phonon-roton spectrum has been given by Feynman
and its improvements have been proposed since then [12].
Landau also pointed out that just as there is no con-
tinuous transition in quantum mechanics between states
with zero angular momentum and states with finite an-
gular momentum, there may not be a continuous tran-
sition between the potential flow and the vortex motion
branches of the excitation spectrum [9]. The phonon-
roton spectrum is known to end at ω= 2∆ /ℏ,k=kc
[1]. Specifically, extrapolated to zero pressure values of
the parameters are ∆ = 0 .74meV ,k0= 1.9˚A−1, and
kc= 3.6˚A−1[10]. Pitaevskii [13] discussed a possibil-
ity and Marchenko and Parshin [14] further argued that
at low pressure the spectrum of vortex rings begins at a
wave number kb>2k0and an energy ℏωbof several ∆.
The coordinates of the beginning point of the spectrum
were estimated as kb= 4.3˚A−1andℏωb= 2.2meV [14].
In the macroscopic approximation the spectrum of
quantized vortex rings is given by [1]
ω= 2π2ρsℏ
m2RlnR
a, k = 2π2ρs
mR2(5)
where ρsis the superfluid density, mis the mass of the
Heatom, Ris the radius of the vortex ring playing a
role of the parameter, ais the core radius of the vortex
having atomic scale, and it is assumed that ln( R/a)≫1.
Eqs.(5) conveys the fact that the larger the ring radius,
the larger are its wave number and frequency (energy).
Existence of the beginning point of the spectrum k=kb
then corresponds to a ring of smallest radius Rb. The
latter can be computed from the k(R) dependence (5).
Indeed, employing extrapolated to zero pressure value
of the superfluid density ρs= 0.145g/cm3[1] and the
estimate kb= 4.3˚A−1[14] one finds Rb= 3.2˚A[14].
High energy part of the vortex branch of the elemen-
tary excitation spectrum (5) has been observed in exper-
iments of Rayfield and Reif [15] who studied the mobility
of ions in Helium. They established that at energies of
1.5 to 45 eVions create vortex rings, attach to them and
move together. Charged rings of these energies have radii
varying from 5 ×10−6to 10−4cmwhich correspond to
very large wave numbers k≫kb. So far the beginning
part of the vortex branch of the elementary excitations
spectrum has not been observed.
The goal of this work is to determine the geometry of
wake patterns in unbounded liquid visible in variationof the velocity field due to interference of vortex ring
excitations. Since the motion around the vortex filament
is accompanied by a density change of the liquid, there
will be an additional density pattern accompanying the
velocity field in the wake. As we shall see, as the source
velocity vincreases, wake patterns undergo qualitative
changes which have their origin in the existence of the
beginning point of the spectrum k=kbthus opening an
opportunity to its observation.
If the requirement ln( R/a)≫1 is relaxed to ln( R/a)⩾
1 where the expression (5) remains qualitatively correct,
one can see that for a ring of radius R∗=eaits group
dω/dk and phase ω/kvelocities coincide. Corresponding
wave number evaluated from the equation for k(R) (5) is
k∗= 2π2ρse2a2/m; specifically, dω/dk < ω/k ifk > k∗.
Employing experimentally deduced value of a= 0.7˚A
[14, 15] one finds that k∗= 1.6˚A−1. Since the begin-
ning point of the spectrum is restricted by the inequality
kb>2k0(= 3.8˚A−1) [13], we infer that for k⩾kbthe
group velocity is smaller than the phase velocity. This
means that the equation ω(k) =kvdetermining bound-
ary values of the wave numbers satisfying the MCL con-
dition (1) has either one solution or no solutions at all.
With this in mind the effect of the beginning point of
the spectrum on wake patterns can be in part anticipated
based on the observation that the velocity
vb=ωb
kb(6)
corresponding to the slope of a straight line connecting
the origin ω(0) = 0 to the beginning point of the vortex
branch of the spectrum ω(kb)≡ωbplays a special role.
Indeed, if v < v b, then only vortex excitations with suffi-
ciently large wave numbers satisfy the MCL condition (1)
and participate in making wake patterns. On the other
hand, if v > v b, the MCL conditions holds for excitations
of all allowed wave numbers, k⩾kb.
A relationship between the Landau critical roton ve-
locity vc(4) and the velocity vb(6) is not yet estab-
lished since coordinates of the beginning point of the
vortex spectrum are not reliably known. If vb< vc,
as the source velocity vincreases, vortex wake patterns
will undergo qualitative change before the rotons of the
Landau branch are generated. The reverse is true if
vb> vc. The latter scenario will be realized if the esti-
mates kb= 4.3˚A−1andℏωb= 2.2meV [14] are accurate.
Indeed, extrapolated to zero pressure Landau critical ro-
ton velocity (4) is vc= 60 m/s while vb= 79 m/s. How-
ever even in this case interfering roton and vortex wake
patterns can be distinguished thanks to unique features
of vortex wake patterns described below. Regardless of
a relationship between vb(6) and vc(4), this opens an
experimental opportunity to observe the beginning of the
vortex branch of the excitation spectrum.
Eliminating the ring radius between ωandk, Eqs.(5)3
can be brought into an explicit ω(k) dependence:
ω2=π2ℏ2ρs
2m3kln2mk
2π2ρsa2
. (7)
Since the logarithm is a slowly varying function of its ar-
gument and the logarithmic approximation ln( R/a)≫1
may be only qualitatively correct in the vicinity of the
beginning point of the spectrum, the dispersion law of
vortex ring excitations will be approximated by an ex-
pression
ω2=gk, g ≃ℏ2ρs
m3, k⩾kb (8)
so that the characteristic velocity (6) is given by
vb=rg
kb. (9)
If the parameter gwould be the free fall acceleration,
and existence of the wave number cutoff kbwould be
ignored, the dispersion law (8) would be identical to that
of gravity waves on deep water [2, 5]. The parameter gin
Eq.(8) is however eleven orders of magnitude larger than
the free fall acceleration which will have dramatic effect
on the spatial scale of wake patterns.
It is straightforward to verify that for the dispersion
law (8) the MCL condition (1) becomes cos φ=p
g/kv2
and can always be satisfied for sufficiently large wave
number k. As a result the vortex wake appears for any
velocity, thus implying that vc= 0.
The problem of determining wake patterns due to in-
terference of the vortex ring excitations in the approxima-
tion given by Eq.(8) is then similar to that determining
ship wakes. The important difference lies in the nature
of the wave number cutoff. Indeed, wake patterns due
to smooth traveling pressure disturbance can be under-
stood in terms of an effective ultraviolet wave number
cutoff having its origin in spatial scale (s) of the pressure
distribution [16]. Similarly, there exists an ultraviolet
wave number cutoff in the problem of determining wake
patterns due to a charge traversing a two-dimensional
electron gas [17]; here the cutoff originates from the De-
bye screening. In both of these cases, the role of the cutoff
wavenumber is to suppress sufficiently short-wavelength
excitations from participating in forming wake patterns.
In the case of present interest (8), however, the wave
number cutoff at k=kbisinfrared which means suf-
ficiently long-wavelength excitations are excluded from
participating in forming wake patterns. The outcome
can be inferred from the classic analysis of wake patterns
due to traveling point pressure source [4, 5]; below we
follow the approach of Refs. [8, 16].
Ifkb= 0 the parameters of the problem such as gand
vcan be combined into a single length scale
l=v2
g(10)called the Kelvin length [16] which (for point source) de-
termines fine structure of the resulting wake pattern. For
example, for v≃10m/s one finds l≃1˚Awhich means
that fine structure of the wake can be only resolved with
the help of X-ray or neutron scattering.
In the presence of finite wave number cutoff k=kb
there exists an additional length scale ≃k−1
bwhich can
be combined with the Kelvin length (10) to form a di-
mensionless combination
M=p
lkb=v
vb(11)
where in the second representation Eqs.(9) and (10) were
employed. If 1 /kbwould be a scale characterizing the
source, then Mwould be a Froude number [5]. However
since the scale 1 /kbis the property of the medium, it is
more appropriate to call the parameter Ma Mach num-
ber, the ratio of the source velocity to the characteristic
velocity of the medium. The M= 0 case then would be
closely related to the original Kelvin wake pattern due
to traveling point pressure source [4, 5]; specifically, in
any plane intersecting the three-dimensional wake pat-
tern along the path of the source one finds the Kelvin
wake [8]. Hereafter the length is measured in units of
the Kelvin length (10) and wave numbers in units of 1 /l.
Then the constraint k⩾kbin Eq.(8) becomes k⩾M2.
Wake patterns are stationary in the reference frame
of the source and their geometry can be determined via
Kelvin’s stationary phase argument [4, 5, 8, 16]. It is a
condition of stationary of the phase f=k·rsubject to
the MCL condition (1) (here ris the three-dimensional
position vector measured relative to the location of the
source). Assuming the source is moving in the positive x
direction, the stationary phase condition for the problem
at hand (8) has the form [8, 16]:
−ϱ
x=√
k−1
2k−1, k⩾M2(12)
where ϱis the distance from the x-axis (the pattern has
axial symmetry around the path of the source).
Since the phase fis constant along the wavefront,
Eq.(12) and f=k·rcan be solved relative to xand
ϱto give the equation for the wavefronts in parametric
form:
x(k) =−2πn2k−1
k3/2, ϱ(k) = 2 πn√
k−1
k3/2, k⩾M2(13)
where f=−2πnandnis positive integer [8, 16].
Eqs. (12) and (13) can have solutions only for x <
0 (which is where the wake is) satisfying the inequality
k⩾1 (k⩾1/l(10) in the physical units). The latter
fact means that even without the additional constraint
k⩾M2, wake patterns are a result of interference of
sufficiently short-wavelength excitations.
The functional dependence (12) is shown in Figure 1.

maximum value of 1 /2√
2 atk= 3/2. Thus, Eq.(12) has
two solutions for 0 ⩽−ϱ/x < 1/2√
2, corresponding to
transverse (t) (ascending orange part of the curve) and
diverging (d) (descending red part of the curve) wave-
fronts. These solutions merge at −ϱ/x= 1/2√
2, while
none are found above this value. From this one obtains
Kelvin’s classic result that the wake is confined by the
angle 2 arctan(1 /2√
2)≈39◦.
The effect of the additional constraint k⩾M2in (12),
representing existence of the beginning point of the spec-
trum (8), can be now simply understood. Indeed, if
M2<1 the constraint is unimportant and all the ex-
citations satisfying the inequality k⩾1 participate in
producing the wake which (in any plane containing the
path of the source) will be the Kelvin wake. Specifically,
transverse wavefronts connect the edges of the pattern
(k= 3/2), across the path of the source ( k= 1) as shown
in Figure 2a in orange. Their periodicity along the path
of the source ( ϱ= 0) in the original physical units, 2 πl, is
fixed by the Kelvin length (10). Additionally, diverging
wavefronts connect the edges of the pattern ( k= 3/2) to
the source ( k=∞) as shown in Figure 2a in red. Figures
1 and 2 are color coordinated to make it clear that inter-
ference of waves whose wave numbers belong to a rangemarked in given color in Figure 1 produces wavefronts
colored in the same fashion in Figure 2.
Wake pattern in Figure 2a undergoes qualitative
change when the Mach number Mexceeds unity because
now the constraint k⩾M2is stronger than the built-
in condition k⩾1 in Eqs.(12) and (13). The critical
valueM=M1= 1 corresponds to the source velocity
v=v1matching the characteristic velocity (6) as was
already anticipated. If M>1, there are still two cases
to consider:
(i) If 1 <M⩽p
3/2, then transverse wavefronts no
longer reach the path of the source. According to the
condition of stationary phase (12) they start out on the
conical surface
−ϱ
x=√
M2−1
2M2−1(14)
corresponding to k=M2and extend to the edges of
the pattern, k= 3/2. Transverse wavefronts are absent
within the cone (14) whose opening angle is given by
2θ= 2 arctan√
M2−1
2M2−1(15)
The outcome is shown in Figure 2b. When experimen-
tally observed, change in appearance of wake patterns
between Figures 2a and 2b would be an indirect evidence
of the beginning part of the vortex branch of the elemen-
tary excitations spectrum.
(ii) Wake pattern in Figure 2b undergoes another qual-
itative change when the Mach number Mexceedsp
3/2
because now transverse wavefronts completely disappear.
The critical value M=M2=p
3/2 corresponds to
the source velocity v=v2=p
3/2vb≈97m/s where
we used already mentioned estimate vb= 79 m/s. For
M>p
3/2 the wake is made only of diverging wave-
fronts as shown in Figure 2c. The entire wake pattern
is now confined within a cone defined by Eq.(14) whose
opening angle (15) decreases with the Mach number; in
theM ≫ 1 limit the opening angle vanishes as 1 /M.
The instants v=v1andv=v2when vortex wake
patterns undergo qualitative changes in their appearance
represent critical phenomena. It is expected that they
will be accompanied by singular changes in the wave re-
sistance which we are planning to study in the future.
The property of superfluidity is to some extent elim-
inated within the region occupied by vortex wake pat-
terns. We argue that superfluidity is completely elimi-
nated at the wavefronts shown in Figure 2 which is where
the vorticity is largest.
To summarize, we demonstrated that vortex wake pat-
terns in superfluid4Heexhibit elements of Kelvin ship
wake to varying degree depending on the source speed.
We explained that changes in appearance of wake pat-
terns with the source speed can serve as an experimen-
tal evidence of the beginning part of the vortex excita-5

the path of the source. Transverse (t) and diverging (d) wavefronts are shown in orange and red, respectively.
Regions where both transverse and diverging wavefronts are found are shaded light blue; regions without transverse

tion spectrum. It is necessary to emphasize that coarse-
grained outlines of the wake patterns in Figures 2a-2c
should be observable by light scattering techniques while
the fine structure of all the discussed wake patterns can
be only resolved with the help of X-ray or neutron scat-
tering.
These results (with suitable changes) also apply to
other types of superfluids, specifically fermion superfluids
in cold atomic gases [18] and dipolar quantum gases [19]
thus enlarging the pool of experimental systems where
vortex wake patterns can be observed.
Finally, the idea that fingerprints of relevant elemen-
tary excitations can be found in experimentally observed
wake patterns goes beyond the example of vortex rings in
superfluid4Heinvestigated in this work. Other notable
examples include wake patterns in superfluid4Hedue
to the Landau phonon-roton excitations [8] and Kelvin-
Mach wakes in a two-dimensional Fermi gas; the latter
have their origin in interference of plasma oscillations
[17]. Mathematically accurate solution of the problem
of determination of the spectrum of elementary excita-
tions from wake patterns may have an applied value.
