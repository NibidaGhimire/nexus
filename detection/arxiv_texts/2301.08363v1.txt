Abstract  
Two-dimensional simulation s are conducted to investigate the direct initiation of cylindrical 
detonation in hydrogen/ air mixture s with detailed chemistry . The e ffects of hotspot condition  and 
mixture composition gradient on detonation initiation are studied. Different  hotspot pressure and 
composition are first considered in the uniform mixture. It is found that detonation initiation fails for 
low hotspot pressure s and super critical regime dominates with high hotspot pressure s. Detonation is 
directly initiated from the  reactive hotspot , whilst it is ignited somewhere beyond the  nonreactive 
hotspot s. Two cell diverging patterns (i.e., abrupt and gradual) are identified and the detailed  
mechanisms  are analyzed . Moreover, cell coalescence occurs if many  irregular cells are generated 
initially , which promotes the local cell growing. We also consider nonuniform detonable mixture s. The 
results show that the initiated detonation experiences self -sustaining propagation, highly unstable  
propagation , and extinc tion in mixture s with a linearly decreasing equivalence ratio  along the  radial 
direction respectively , i.e., 1→0.9, 1→0.5 and 1 →0. Moreover , the hydrodynamic structure analysis 
shows that , for the self-sustaining detonation s, the hydrodynamic thickness increases at the overdrive n 
stage , decreases as the cells are generated , and eventually become  almost constant at the cell diverging 
stage , within which the sonic plane shows a “sawtooth” pattern . However,  in the  detonation extinction 
cases, the hydrodynamic thickness continuously increases,  and no “sawtooth” sonic plane  can be 
observed .

Detonation  propulsion , e.g.,  rotating detonation engine,  has great  potential because of  high 
thermal efficiency and simple structure.  Efficient  detonation initiation is critical to materialize this 
technology  with compact engine structure and reliable operation . Typically,  detonati ve combustion  can 
be ignited by  indirect and direct initiation. For the latter , a detonation can be initiated when the 
deposited energy is sufficie ntly high  (Body 1997) , e.g., through spark  (Matsui & Lee 1976 ) or 
detonating cord  (Higgins , Radulescu  & Lee 1998) . However, due to e xtremely short  space and time 
scales, detailed detonation initiation and development are  difficult to be captured  experimentally  
(Radulescu  et al.  2003) , and hence our understanding about  the underlying mechanism  is still rather 
limited . 
It is well known that a  critical energy Ec exists to directly initiate a detonation wave in  a detonable 
mixture  (Zhang & Bai 2014 ). Depending on the deposited energy Es, three regimes  are identified: 
supercritical  (Es >Ec), critical ( Es≈Ec), and subcritical  (Es<Ec) regimes  (Ng & Lee 2003) . Zel’dovich  
(1956) propose  a theoretical model  to determine the critical energy  Ec, where  Ec varies exponentially 
with the induction  length . However, due to  a series of  simplifications  involved , their criterion  is 
applicable  for stable detonation , in which the inductio n length is relatively small . After that , several  
prediction models are developed , e.g., by Lee , Knystautas  & Guirao . (1982) , Zhang , Ng & Lee (2012) , 
and Ng (2005), in which  an average delay in ignition is applied.  The critical  energy  predicted by these 
models  is in good  agreement with the experimental data since well estimated detonation  parameters 
are incorporated, such as detonation cell size  and critical tube  diamete r. However, the detonation front 
is intrinsically unstable and exhibits a complex triple -point structure , which plays a key role in the 
direct detonation initiation  (Shen & Parsani 2017) .  
Taking detonation curvature and unsteadiness  into account,  Kasimov and Stewart  (2004) establish 
a prediction model named  as 𝐷̅−𝐷−κ (𝐷̅ is detonation wave  acceleration, D the detonation speed , 
and κ the curvature) , using single -step chemistry . Their model is  improved by Soury  and Mazaheri  
(2009 ), who incorporate  detailed chemical kinetics  and predict  better relation s between Ec and the 3 equivalence ratio. However , the model works for limited mixture composition  due to the complex 
chemical reaction process and multi -dimensional effects during direct initiation  (Zhang & Bai 20 14). 
Furthermore, some detail s, including time-dependent detonation structure variations , and its effect s of 
unburned pockets on the direct initiation process , cannot be elucidate d by these model s.  
Different from planar detonations, the cu rvature plays  an important role in cylindrical  and 
spherical  detonation s. He (1996) , Eckett , Quirk  & Shepherd  (2000) , Watt & Sharpe  (2004; 2005 ), and 
Han et al. (2017)  demonstrate  the destabilizing effect  of global curvature  on detonation waves , and 
larger curvature  would  aggravate  these effects . For instance , He (1996)  find that a maximum curvature 
is defined by the the nonlinear curvature effect, beyond which a self -sustaining detonation cannot be 
obtained. Eckett , Quirk  & Shepherd  (2000)  point out that the unsteadiness in the induction zone  is 
responsible for failure of detonation ini tiation. Watt & Sharpe  (2004; 2005 ) show  that the pulsation 
amplitude  arising  from the curvature varies with the radius with which the  detonation is first generated . 
Considering cellular stability, Han et al.  (2017 ) find that the detonation structure  evolves following 
three stages , i.e., no cell, growing cells,  and diverging cells . They also analyze the weakening effect of 
unburned pockets on average detonation speed as the detonation cell increases (hence curvature 
decreases).  
Most  previous work on direct initiation is focuse d on one-dimensional problems  where only 
longitudinal pulsating in stability is incorporated  (Ng & Lee 2003; He 1996; Eckett , Quirk  & Shepherd  
2000;  Watt & Sharpe  2004; Watt & Sharpe  2005 ; Han et al.  2017 ; Qi & Chen 2017 ). Nonetheless, in 
realistic situations, multi -dimensional cellular  instability should be considered. Shen & Parsani (2017 , 
2019) study the effect s of multi -dimensional instabilities on the direct initiation by comparing the 
phenomen a from  one- and two-dimensional simulations. Their results show  that the one-dimensional 
configuration  become s invalid  for unstable detonations . They also emphasiz e the important role of  
strong transverse waves  from multi -dimensional instabilities  in the failure  and initiation process of 
detonation . Moreover, Han et al.  (2018) examine the effect s of activation energies of chemical kinetics 
on detonation initiation. They find that the continuous  propagation of cellular detonation with high er 
activation energies exhibit  a stronger dependence  on regeneration of the transvers e wave. Furthermore , 4 Jiang  et al.  (2009) identify  four mechanisms  of the cell diverging in cylindrical detona tion expansion  
based on  two-dimensional simu lation s. This provide s a deeper understanding  on the relation between 
flow instability and generation/diminish ing of transverse wave s in different patterns.  Besides, Asahara 
et al.  (2012) further shows the detailed Mach configuration and generation of sub -transverse waves 
during the cell diverging proces s. 
Past numerical work on direct detonation initiation is mostly concentrated on uniform mixture . 
To the best of our knowledge, research on direct initiation of a detonation in non -uniform mixtures is 
still lacking . Furthermore, the effects of hotspot p roperties  (e.g., reactive,  or nonreactive) on the 
mechanisms of detonation initiation have not been  well understood . In the current study, we aim to 
examine the effect s of hotsp ot properties and mixtures composition gradient on direct detonation  
initiation.  Two-dimensional simulations with detailed chemical mechanism will be conducted. The 
manuscript  is organized as follows:  section 2 presents the g overning equation and numerical method , 
whilst the results and discussion are detailed in section s 3 and 4 , respectively , followed by section 5 
with conclusions.  
 
2. Mathematical  and physical models  
2.1. Numerical  method  
The Naiver -Stokes  equations of mass, momentum, energy, and species mass fractions are solved 
for compressible reacting flows , with  the solver  RYrhoCentralFoam  (Xu et al.  2021 ). The accuracies  
of RYrhoCentralFoam  in detonation  simulations  have been  extensively  validated  (Huang et al.  2021) , 
and it has been  used for various  detonation problem s (Huang , Cleary  & Zhang  2020; Huang  & Zhang  
2020; Xu, Zhao  & Zhang  2021 ). Second -order implicit backward method is employed for temporal 
discretization , and the time step is  1×10−9 s. A Riemann -solver -free MUSCL  scheme  (Kurganov , 
Noelle  & Petrova  2001 ) with v an Leer limiter  is employ ed to calculate the convective flux es in the 
momentum equations . The total variation diminishing  scheme is used for the convection terms in 
energy and species equations , whilst  a second -order central differencing scheme is adopted for the 5 diffusion terms  in equations of momentum, energy, and  species mass fraction s (Huang  et al.  2021; 
Green shields  et al.  2010 ). A detailed hydrogen  mechanism is applied, with 13 species and 27 reactions  
(Burke et al. 2012) . The c hemi cal source term  is integrated  with an implicit Euler method .  
 
2.2. Physical problem  and numerical implementation  
The expanding cylindrical detonation has the intrinsic characteristic of cellular instability , which 
plays an important role in initiation of transverse waves  (Shen & Parsani 2017; Han et al.  2017 ). In 
this work, two-dimensional simulations (see Fig. 1) are conducted to capture the detonation frontal 
instability  and dynamic behaviors . Due to the geometrical  symmetry , a quarter area of the domain  is 
simulated, and the domain is 0.5×0.5 m2 (see Fig. 1). The x and y axes are aligned with the symmetry 
boundar ies, and the radius is 𝑅= √(𝑥2+𝑦2) . For two outlets , wave -transmissive  condition is 
enforced for the pressure , whereas  zero-gradient condition  for all rest quantities .

the hotspot size may affect the detonation initiation  (Lee & Ramamurthi  1976 ), but we will not study 
it in this paper. Both n on-reactive ( the hotspot composition is air) and reactive (H 2+O 2 or H2+air) 
hotspot s are considered .  
The second part, beyond the hotspot, is filled with quiescent  detonable gas, i.e., H2+O2+N2 
mixtures . The initial pressure is p0 = 20265  Pa and the initial temperature is T0 = 300 K. Both uniform 
and varying  composition of the detonable mixture will be studied. For the form er, the composition of 
the gaseous mixture is H 2:O2:N2 = 0.0282:0.2255:0.7463 by mass . For the latter, linear change of the 
equivalence ratio along  the radial direction will be considered  to examine its effect s on detonation 
initiation and subsequent development .  
The uniform  62.5 μm Cartesian  cells are adopted  to discretize the domain  in Fig. 1 , and the total 
mesh number is about 64 million . The half-reaction length  from the theoretical ZND structure is 
approximately  l1/2 = 1 mm, calculated by the S hock and Detonation  Toolbox  (Shepherd  2021 ), and 
hence the foregoing  mesh  size correspond s to about 16 pts/ l1/2 for a CJ detonation. The mesh sensitivity 
test is shown  in Section A of the supplementary document , and the results show tha t mesh convergence 
can be  obtained  when the mesh  resolution of 16 pts/ l1/2 is employed.

 7 2.3. Simulation case  
Parametric studies are performed and nine cases , i.e., A -I, are selected for discussion in this 
paper (see details in Table  1). Specifically, case A -F have different hotspot parameters , whereas 
case F-I different composition gradient s in the detonable gas . When  the air is filled in the hotspot, 
critical regime dominates for relative ly high p0 (e.g., A and B), whereas  critical regime  for low p0 
(e.g., C and D ). Moreover, super-critical  regime  is observed  with reactive hotspot s (e.g., E and F). 
To study the mixture composition gradients , reactive hotspot with H 2+O 2 (same with F) is selected 
to ensure successful  initiation. Three e quivalence ratio  gradients are considered. Specifically, t he 
equivalence ratio in the vicinity of  the hotspot  (the radius R = 0.02  m) is fixed to be 1, which 
decrease s linearly  to a certain value (e.g., 0.5, see Table 1 ) at the o uter edge (R = 0.5  m). For easy 
reference, we use an arrow to indicate the  radial  ER change, e.g., 1 →0.9 in case G.  
 
3. Results  
3.1. Effect s of hotspot  properties  
In this section , we will study the effects of hotspot pressure and gas composition on detonation 
initiation and development in a uniform detonable gas . 
 
3.1.1 Hotspot pressure  effects  
Figure 2 shows the  leading shock speed versus the radius with different  hotspot pressures , i.e., 
ps = 250p0, 200 p0, 150 p0, 100p0. They are  case A-D, and t he hotspot is filled with air. The shock 
speed is estimated along the radial monitoring line (see Fig. 1).  The detonation is successfully 
initiated  only when ps ≥ 200p0. Under relative ly low hotspot pressures , the shock from the hotspot 
decelerate s quickly and the detonation initiation fails.  For instance, w ith ps = 150p0, the shock speed 
increases from 0.03  to 0.035  m after a n initial  drop (see the inset of Fig. 2). This is because intense 
reaction s are  triggered to release energy intensifying  the shock . However, due to fast shock decay, 
the reaction front ( RF) fails to coherently couple with the leading shock front ( SF). Therefore, t he 8 latter degrades  to a blast wave  with a speed of  around 0.3 VCJ, correspond ing to the sub-critical 
regime  (Ng & Lee 2003) . 
With ps = 200p0 and 250p0, the shock from the ignition spot steeps into an overdriven 
detonation , due to the  strengthening effects from the shocked mixture . The detonation gradually  
decays to a freely propagating  detonation around 0.1 m. This  can be categorized into t he critical 
regime . The average propagation speed is slightly lower than the CJ speed , which is  caused by the 
curvature effects  (Ng & Lee 2003) . 
 
 
Figure 2: Change  of the leading shock speed  with radial distance when  different hotspot pressures  
are con sidered  (case A-D). 
 
Figure 3 shows the detonation cell evolutions recorded from  the peak pressure trajectories  in 
case A and B. For cylindrical detonations, the cell size λ is defined from the azimuthal  direction  
(roughly perpendicular to the detonation propagation direction ) (Lee 1984 ). For both cases, the 
detonation cell experience s three  stages  as the front curvature decreases: no cell  (Ⅰ), growing cells  
(Ⅱ), and diverging cells  (Ⅲ), as annotated in Fig. 3. This  is consistent with the observation by Han 
et al (2017 ). However, the detonation cell growing is not quantified  in their study, and the detailed 
diverging process and mechanism  still remain to be revealed. In diverging cells stage , new cells are

 Case D9 generated from the enlarged cells. As such, some small fluctuations of the shock speed along the 
monitoring line are superimposed on the original periodic fluctuations, leading to double peaks, see 
the circles in Fig. 2.  Besides, the detonation cell evolution before the cell diverging stage (III) is 
featured by a series of cell-family . The results show  that the number of detonation cell keeps almost 
constant as the cells grow. As such , the detonation cell increases linearly  with the distance. Besides, 
higher hotspot pressure  generates more  cell-family numbers, corresponding to globally smaller cell 
size. The calculated  cell-family numbers in case A and B are about 17 and 12 , respectively. This is 
justifiable because large  hotspot pressure result s in high overdrive degree of the newly generated 
detonation wave. B esides, at R > 3.5 m, the cell begins  to diverge in both cases. The diverging 
happens  only in locally larger cells  in case A (see red circles), but in larger  domain in case B with 
greater growth rate.

3.1.2 Hotspot composition  effects  
Here  we will further examine the influences of hotspot composition  on detonation initiation and 
development . Figure 4 shows the  shock speed  evolution s when two reactive hotspot s are considered , 
i.e., stoichiome tric H2+air and H2+O 2 mixtures.  They are case E and F, respectively. The result with 
air hotspot ( i.e., case D ) is included  for comparison.  The hotspot pressure is 100 p0. Different from

CJ detonation  in both case E and F , which correspond to the super -critical regime  (Ng & Lee 2003) . 
As the overdrive degree decays, the p eriodic fluctuation s of the shock speed  occur earlier  in case 
E, indicating an earlier  onset  of detonation cellularization . Furthermore, the speed  fluctuatio n in 
case E exhibit s more  irregular ity, especially at larger  radii (hence smaller curvature).

the maximum radius  in our simulation , the cell is still too small to diverge. Furthermore, in case E 
(H2+air) , some relative ly small cells merge  to the adjacent  large r ones at the second  stage , see the  
red circle s in Fig. 5(a). This phenomenon will be further discussed in Section 4. 2. Moreover,  cell 
diverging occurs  at R = 0.45-0.5 m. The cell inhomogeneity  and diverging behaviour  lead to  
irregular shock speed  fluctuation s in Fig. 4. The cell -family number in E and F  are 18 and 31, 
respectively . Consequently , the cell in F grows more slowly and its maximum  cell size reaches 
about 27  mm, slightly smaller than the theoretical value , 28.9 mm  (Ng, Ju & Lee 2007) . In this 
sense , the detonation can still propagate in a self -sustaining fashion  without new cell generation . 
Combined wit h Fig . 3, it can be found that there exists a range within which  cell diverging is more 
likely  to take place,  and in section  4.2 we will further study  this range.

3.2. Effect s of composition gradient in the detonable mixture  
In this section , we will study detonation initiation in H2+air mixture s with spatially varying  
equivalence ratio . Specifically , the ER in the vicinity of  the hotspot  is 1, and then decreases linearly

stoichiometric H 2+O2 mixture is employed, same as that in case F.  
Figure 6 shows the variations  of the leading shock speed  in case F -H along the monitoring line . 
Since the reactive hotspot (H2+O 2) is employed , overdriven detonatio ns are directly triggered by it 
in all cases. Generally , their shock speed s are close  before 0.1  m, due to the near -stoichiometric 
ERs. Beyond that, s ignificant differences  appear  when the  multi -headed detonation s start to  develop , 
featured by the various speed fluctuations . Among them , continuous detonation propagation  
happen s only in case F (unifor m, φ: 1→1) and G (φ: 1→0.9). The average shock speed during the  
cellular detonation stage (R = 0.12 -0.5 m) in G is 1 ,756 m/s, slightly lower than that in F (1,768 
m/s) since  the mixture reactivity decreases  in the former case (see Section B of the supplementary 
document) . Moreover, i n case H and I, the overdriven detonation gradually decouples when it runs 
outwardly. Specifically, i n case H (φ: 1→0.5), when the shock propagates across R = 0.3 m (the 
local ER is φ = 0.71), the period of speed  fluctuation increase s significantly, indicat ing more 
unstable detonation front . In case I (φ: 1→0), the detonation wave  quickly decouple s across R = 0.3 
m (φ = 0.42) with a shock speed below 900 m/s .  
Figure 7 shows the detonation cell evolutions in case F-I. Almost u niform cell s appear  at about 
0.15 m and grows until 0.5 m in both F and G, except for locally larger cells, as annotated by the 
red circles in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b). This phenomenon is attributed to the cell -family differences (i.e., 
31 for F, 27 for G) and cell coalescence (s ee the inset in Fig. 7), which are caused  by the drop of 
mixture  reactivity with the decrease  of ER in case G ( see Section B of the supplementary document) , 
especially at larger radii.  
Increased composition gradient in case H and I lead to remarkable change of detonation cell 
distribution, as shown in Figs. 7(c) and 7(d). In case H ( φ: 1→0.5), the cells grow steadily  from R 
= 0.15 to 0.3 m and remain diamond shaped. Beyond that, they  become irregular, and some cell s 
grow faster and then merge  with the adjacent smaller cells . As the detonation propagates across  R 
= 0.25 m ( φ = 0.75 ), irregular cell growing appears as the reactivity of mixtures drops significantly  
(see Section B of the supplementary document) . Therefore , apart from  the curvature  decrease which 13 leads to the increase of the detonation cell size , the cell coalescence induced by the ER variation 
plays a more important role in the oversized cell generation. This oversized cell  further  causes the 
local detonation quenching.  At around R = 0.5 m, the detonation becomes very unstable , and 
detonati ve combustion  is even quenched at most of the front . In case I  (φ: 1→0), the detonation 
cells appear at around R = 0.13 m and slightly grows until 0.3 m,  like the rest cases in Fig. 7. 
However, detonation extinction happens  beyond R = 0.3 m (φ = 0.42),  with quickly faded peak 
pressure trajectories in Fig. 7(d) .

Figure 8 shows the time  evolutions  of the shock speed and SF/RF position along the 
monitoring line in case I. Three stages  can be identified: overdriven detonation (0 -0.05 ms), cellular 
detonation (0.5 -0.13 ms ), and detonation quenching (0.13 -0.2 ms). At the cellular detonation stage, 
the shock speed experiences periodic variations with an increasing time interval. The inset in Fig.

speeds of both fronts fluctuate after 0.05 ms and the periodic variations of the SF speed are delayed 
relative to that of the RF, manifesti ng an intrinsic characteristic of unstable cellular detonation. 
Since  0.13 ms, the RF speed continuously decreases and is lower than that of the SF, which indicates 
the decoupling  of SF and RF .

weakens the SF intensity.  Meanwhile, a longer induction zone is formed  behind IS 1. Two detonat ion

4. Discussion  
4.1. Hotspot evolution and their relevance to detonation initiation  
Hotspot evolution and their relevance to  detonation initiation will be discussed  here based on case 
A-F. Figure 1 0 shows the time history of temperature, pressure , and HRR , from a probe  of R = 21 mm , 
i.e., 1 mm off the hotspot vicinity  along the monitoring line . It is shown that i ntense chemical reaction s 
take place in two reactive hotspots  (i.e., case E and F)  with the maximum pressure and temperature 
higher than the corresponding von Neumann  values. This indicates that the detonation s are initiated  
directly from  the hotspot . Note that the detonation in case E manifests a higher overdrive degree ( f = 
1.41) than that in F ( f = 1.09) due to higher oxygen concentration  (Short  & Stewart  1999) . As the 
overdriven detonation expand s outward ly, the probe (i.e., already in the post -detonation area)

almost zero.  
Figure 1 1(a) shows the  evolutions of  the reactive  hotspot along the monitoring line fr om 10 -110 
nanoseconds  in case F (H2+O 2 hotspot, ps = 150 p0). The reader should be reminded that due to one -
dimensional nature of early shock/detonation  structure s, the results in Fig. 11 do not exhibit azimuthal  
variations . Homogeneous isochoric reactions occur  inside the spot, leading to quickly increase d 
pressure and temperature. The HRR peaks  at about 41.5 nanoseconds , and then quickly decreases  to 
low value s at around 110 nanoseconds . Meanwhile, the hotspot pressure and temperature remain 
unchange d from 90 to  110 nanoseconds , indicating the completion of chemical reactions in the hotspot. 
During this period, the premixture outside the hotspot remain intact; see Fig. 1 1(a). The hotspot 
reaction leads to increased pressure and temperature gradients  at the hotspot vicinity , which plays an  
important role in initiating a  detonatio n (Gu, Emerson  & Bradley  2003 ).  
Plotted in Fig. 1 1(b) are the state evolutions at the hotspot v icinity after 0.2 μs. Apparently, an 
outwardly propagating SF (the shock pressure is around 40 p0) emanated from the hotspot vicinity can 
be observed. It arrives at the probe at around 0.5 μs, resulting in a pronounced pressure rise , as shown 
in Fig. 10 . A RF trails behind the shock , burning the compressed H 2+air mixture, featured by high 
HRR. Their mutual reinforcem ent quickly initiate s a developing detonation, as found from the 
subsequent instants (0.7 -1.1 μs) in Fig . 11(b). Furthermore, t he corresponding evolutions of CEM, a 
chemical explosive mode  (Lu et al.  2010) , along the monitoring line is shown in Fig 14(a). Finite CEM 
can be seen near the hotspot vicini ty, manifesting the locally strong reactivity, which induces the 
immediate onset of detonation.  Besides, there is a secondary inwardly propagating RF in the spo t in 
Fig. 1 1(b). This may be attributed to  chemical  reaction s as the local temperature drops due to thermal 
diffusion  (see Fig. 1 1b). In addition , the hotspot evolution in case E is generally like that in F, but the 
shock arrives at the probe around 0. 2 µs later, due to slower speed . 
Differently , for non -reactive hotspots in case A-D, we can see from Fig. 10 that, although the 
maximum pressure exceeds the von Neumann  values , their maximum temperatures are much lower 18 than the respective von Neumann  values. Furtherm ore, their peak HRRs that occur downstream of the 
hotspot are almost four orders of magnitude sm aller than  those  in E and F. All these indicate that only 
shock compression  occurs there and detonation has not developed yet . As shown in Section 3, 
detonations are ultimately initiated in case A and B. Therefore, it is interesting to further investigate 
how they are generated with a shock from the hotspot.

We first look at case A, and the corresponding hotspot evolutions along the  monitoring line  from 
0.8-2 μs are shown in Fig. 1 2. Note that the pressure inside the spot is maintained at the initial  value, 
i.e., 250 p0, since no reactions happen therein (not displayed  in Fig. 1 2). At larger radii , e.g., at R = 21-
28 mm, the pressure peak first deceases and then increases, see the inset of Fig. 1 2. This is because  the

0.8-1.4 μs). The peak pressure at 1. 4 μs is arou nd 22 p0, 1.4 times the von Neumann value , whilst the 
peak HRR  reaches  around 1.5 × 109 J/m3/s (not shown  in Fig. 12) . Subsequently , the reaction s start in 
the shocked mixture  (2-3 mm off the hotspot) at approximately 2 μs, and  the peak HRR increases to  
around 5 × 1011 J/m3/s at 3-4 μs. This indicates  the formation of shock -induced auto -igniti ng RF and 
its acceleration behind the leading SF (Gu, Emerson  & Bradley  2003) . As the RF couples to the leading 
SF, the detonation is initiated. In this case, CEM keeps zero close to the hotspot (see Fig. 14b), and 
increases immediately behind the SF and peaks at the RF from  1-2 μs. As the autoignition wave 
approaches the SF, the distribution of CEM shows double peaks at 3 -4 μs and the CEM rises 
dramatically behind the SF. This detonation initiation fashion  differs from those in case E and F , where 
the unburned mixture is directly ignited by the detonation  from the hotspot . As such, it can be expected 
that detonation initiation beyond the hotspot is more affected by reactivity of the detonable mixture , 
besides the hotspot itself . The hotspot evolution in case B is like that in A, but with a delayed detonation 
initiation . The shock wave arrives at the probe 0. 02 µs later than that in Case A, see Fig . 10.

Figure 1 3 shows the hotspot evolution along the monitoring line in case D. Similar to case A, the 
pressure peak drops initially (0.8 -1.4 μs) and then increase (2 μs). However, it drops again from 2 to 4 
μs; see the inset in Fig. 1 3. This is because although the reaction contributes to the shock amplification, 
the peak pressure keeps only 14 -16p0, close to the von Neu mann value (15.1p0) (Shepherd  2021 ). 
Furthermore, the thermally neutral  zone is continuously lengthened  from 2 to 4 μs. The auto -ignition 
RF is also ignited like case A . Nonetheless, the RF cannot synchronize  with the leading SF, eventually 
failing to initiate the detonation . Different from case A, the distribution of CEM shows one single peak 
at 3-4 μs in case D  (see Fig. 14c) , and an obvious plat eau appears during the rise of the CEM (see A 
region in Fig. 14c) at 4 μs due to the decoupling of RF and SF. Actually, during the later propagation 
of the shock, no detonation development (e.g., deflagration -to-detonation transition) is found. In 
another detonation failure case, C, hotspot evolution is generally similar to that in case D .

To generalize the hotspot effects, we conduct a series of  simulation s by changing the hotspot 
pressure for  both non-reactive (i.e., air) and reactive  (i.e., H 2+O 2 and H2+air) hotspot s. Figure 1 5 show s 
the probe pressure  (pp) and temperature  (Tp) as functions of  the hotspot pressure (ps) at the probe ( R = 
21 mm).  Since the isochoric reactions first take place inside the spot for reactive hotspots (i.e., H 2+O 2, 
H2+air), we also present the maximum pressure ( pmax/p0) and temperature ( Tmax/T0) when the reactions 
are completed in the hotspot.  
Generally, detonations are not initiated directly from  all non-reactive hotspots  regardless of its 
pressure ; see the probe  temperature in Fig. 15(a). When the hotspot pressure is ps = 50-300p0, the 
detonation can be initiated somewhere beyond the hotspot on ly when  ps ≥ 200 p0. Moreover, detonation 
initiation depends on whether the shock is strong enough to ignite the detonable mixture followed . For 
the studied cases, the peak probe pressure  should be at least 1.5 times the von Neumann pressure for 
successful initiation.  It is seen from Fig. 1 5(a) that  the probe pressure  pp increases monotonically with

detonation cannot be initiated  beyond the hotspot when ps decreases to ≤150p0. Although  the probe 
pressure  for ps =100p0 or 150p0 slightly exceeds the von Neumann spike , the RF is too weak and 
eventually the detonation initiation  is not successful  (marked as “Fail” in Fig. 1 5a).

For the reactive hotspot cases in Fig. 1 5(b), the detonation can be directly initiated due to the 
significant gradient of thermochemical states at the spot vicinity under appropriate ps (i.e., ps≥50p0 
for H2+O 2 hotspot and ps≥100p0 for H 2+air hotspot). No d etonation s can be initiated when the hotspot 
pressure decreases to 10p0 for the H2+O 2 hotspots and ≤50p0 for the H2+air hotspots  (annotated with 
“Fail” in Fig. 1 5b). Based on the current simulations, detonation initiation by the shock beyond the 
reactive hotspot is not observed.  
As the hotspot pressure increases, the peak  hotspot pressure  pmax due to the isochoric reactions 
increases  linearly  (see Fig. 1 5b). However, the peak  hotspot  temperature increases dramatically when 
ps≤150p0; beyond that, it  grow s slowly when  the hotspot pressure further increases . This is because  
the chemical equilibrium moves towards the exothermic reaction direction and gradually approaches 
the limit. Furth ermore , both probe pressure pp and temperature Tp monotonically increase with the 
initial pressur e of the reactive hotspots , and the growth rate decreases with the hotspot pressure. This 
is similar to what is seen from the non -reactive hotspots in Fig. 14(a).

As the cellular instability increases to a certain threshold value  as the detonation propagates 
outwardly , additional transverse waves would be generated to match the growing surface of the 
detonation for self-sustaining propagation  (Han et al.  2017; Jiang et al.  2009) . In this section, we 
will discuss two patterns of cell diverging observed from case B  (see Fig. 3b) : abrupt and gradual 
diverging, respectively , in Figs. 16(a) and 1 6(b). In the abrupt pattern,  as the cell C1 grows and 
develops int o C2 after the next triple point is generated , the secon dary peak pressure  is elevated  in 
C2, signifying the formation of new cells in  it. Nonetheless, for the gradual pattern, relative ly weak 
pressure waves are generated in C4. With the shock interaction between C4 and C5, the forgoing 
weak pressure become stronger in C5 , and eventually  new secondary cells are generated in C5. The 
growth rate  of cell size from C1 to C2 is 50%, much higher than that (22%) from C3 to C4. This 
differen ce is responsible for various  cell diverging patterns  and the details will be presented in Fig s. 
17 and 1 8.

6 3 0Mag_Gradp [×107 Pa/m ]25 Figure 1 7 shows the pressure gradie nt magnitude and temperature distributions during the  
abrupt diverging  transient . The Mach stem , MS, from the triple  point is smooth initially (e.g., at 
165 μ s). Its velocity is higher than the adjacent incident shocks , IS. As the curved  MS propagat es 
outwardly, its surface significantly increases , leading to decreas ing number of cells per unit area of 
the detonation front. Consequently , instability 1 (I1  in Fig. 1 7b) occurs along  the Mach stem , 
leading to  front wrinkl ing (Shen & Parsani 2017) . Moreover, the temperature near I1 is higher than 
that of the surrounding (see 175 μs), corresponding to  higher local reactivity. The shock near I1 
propagates with a greater speed , causing a convex front . The transverse wave  originating  from I1 
propa gates  circumferentially and interact with IS, further  intensifying I1, see 180 μs. Other 
instabilities , e.g., I2 and I3 , appear due to the similar  mechanism. As the MS decays, a  thin gap is 
generated between the leading shock and reaction front, and the temperature therein  is lower (see 
180 μ s), indicating the increas ed induction time . The mixtures near the instabilities are more 
explosive, eventually resulting in  a RF . The RF then couples to the SF, and new Mash stems are 
developed, e.g., at  190 μs. MS1 -3 originates from I1 -3, respectively. Meanwhile,  new instability I4 
is generated due to increased detonation surface . The detonation front is divided into several 
sections , with staggered MS and IS.  
Evolution of the gradual diverging pattern is detailed in Fig. 18. The occurrence of instabilities 
is like those in the abrupt pattern, but they are too weak to induce new cells when the detonation 
expan ds. Instead, the instability amplification during the interaction s between two adjacent shocks 
plays an important role in the diverging process. In Fig. 1 8, the instabilities I1 and I2 only occur 
along  the IS  at 176 μs. As the adjacent MS expands, it collides with  the neighbouring shock. I1 is 
obviously intensified after collision with the transverse wave of the MS ; see 183  μs. This also 
induces the wrinkle d Mach stem. Besides, the interaction between two opposite transverse waves 
originating from I2 and MS, respectively, can be observed, as marked by green circle in Fig. 1 8(b). 
After the instabilit y amplification from IS to the adjacent MS, the subsequent  diverging behaviour 
is like that from t he abrupt pattern. At 195 μs, new hotspots evolve from the instability , generating 
new Mach stems. Finally, new cellular features,  including MS, IS and TW , appear at 206 μs. 26  
 
Figure 1 8: Evolution of gradual cell diverging: pressure gradient magnitude (left column) and 
temperature (right column).  
 
Another phenomenon worthy of discussion at the cell -growing stage is cell coalescence . In 
contrast to the diverging behaviours, the cell coale scence always takes place where the initial 
irregular cell pattern dominates , which subsequently generat es larger local cell . Figure 19 shows a 
detailed  coalescence  process in case E, as demonstrated in Fig. 5(a). To better illustrate the 
underpinning mechanism, a relative cell size ( i.e., cell thickness in this work) perpendicular to the 
cell family direction is introduced, denoted  by la-lc in Fig. 19. The cell thickness of C2 is only 
around a third of C1 or C3, giving a high instability as  the detonation propagat es outwardly. 
Furthermore, as the C1 and C3 grow along the cell family, C2 further decreases until ultimate

Figure 20 shows the  cell coalescence  transient,  using the pressure gradient magnitude and 
temperature distributions at successive instants . At 53 μs, MS1 is generated with intense chemical 
reaction s accompanied by two strong transverse waves , T2 and T 3. Meanwhile, a relative ly weak 
transverse wave  T1 propagates toward s T2. After the collision between  T1 and T2,  MS2 is generated 
near MS1 , and its speed  is larger than that of MS1. As such , two adjacent MS ’s (MS1 and MS2) 
form a large MS along with three TWs, among which T1 and T3 propagate at the same direction. 
The trajectory of T1  can be foun d in Fig. 20 (see d). As the detonation evolves , T1 is gradually 
approaching T3. As T1 coalesces  with T3 and further collide s with T4  (see 59 -61 μs, Fig. 19), a 
new hotspot is generated with local high reactivity (see the circled region, 61 μs), accompanied by 
the disappearance of T3.  
To quantif y the cell variation s as the detonation wave propagates outwardly , in Fig. 21 we 
show the calculated cell size from uniform and non -uniform detonable mixture s. Here the cell size 
is approximated by the radial distance between A and B along the arc R1, as shown in Fig. 2 1(a). 
The fitted line is plotted by the proportional relation between a certain arc and the number of cell -
family, as shown i n Figs. 21(b) and 2 1(c). The cell -family number remains constant before 
diverging in case A, B, and F (see Figs. 3 and 5b) , whilst decreases due to cell coalescence for case 
E and G-I. (see Figs. 5a and 7). Consequently, the fitted lines feature constant for case A, B, F and  
increasing slope for case E  and G-I, respectively, see Fig. 2 1(b) and 2 1(c). Note that t hey are 
obtained from the cell -growing stage in all cases. The theoretical cell size with the Ng correlation 
(Ng, Ju & Lee 2007)  and the experimental data by Stamps  & Tieszen  (1991 ) are also presented for 
reference  in the uniform case .  
Generally, the cell growth rate  decreases (hence cell -family number increases) with hotspot 
pressure for non -reactive hotspots A and B. This can be ascribed to higher detonation strength in 
case A as the cellular detonation initially forms. Besides, a lower cell growth rate of case F can be 
found from Fig. 2 1 (b) due to higher overdrive .

For cases A, B and E, the detonation cell starts to diverge when the cell size approaches a 
certain value. It can be inferred from Fig. 2 1(b) that this threshold is a value greater than the 
corresponding theoretical and experimental cell size s, under which condition the detonation 
propagates at a relatively stable state  (Lee 1984 ). When the cylindrical detonation expands, the 
collisions betw een adjacent transverse waves become difficult due to increased spacing. 
Accordingly, the cellular instability significantly increases, especially as the average cell size 
continuously grows beyond the characteristic cell size . This enhanced  instability le ads to generation

■ ■■30 of new transverse waves to sustain detonation  propagation  (Jiang et al.  2009) . In the studied cases, 
the threshold value is 1.4 -2 times the characteristic cell size under the same mixture condition. It is 
worth noting that real three -dimension detonation structure is very complex involving irregularity 
and inhomogeneity of the detonation cell  (Pintgen et al.  2003; Crane et al.  2022 ), which may lead to 
greater fluctuation s of the threshold than that in the current simulation s.  
For case F, the sizes of cell samples at various radi i are closer to the fitted line due to the more 
uniform distribution. Furthermore, the maximum cell size is well below the corresponding 
theoretical and experimental values, and thus it remains at the cell growing stage even at larger 
radius, see Fig. 5(b). 
In contrast to the uniform mixture cases, only cell  coalesc ence  happens in the  nonuniform 
cases. In these cases, the cell size dramatically increase s as the ER decreases to match the increased 
half-reaction length, which makes the detonation more unstable. For better illustration, we put the 
cell samples horizontal ly adjacent for differen t case s at the same radi i, as annotated  by the column s 
in Fig. 21(c). Generally, t he detonation cell evolutions are similar between  case F (φ = 1) and G ( φ 
= 1→0.9 ) due to close  mixture reactivities . For case H ( φ: 1→0.5) , the cell growth rate  increases 
considerably across 0.3  m. Meanwhile, the cell sizes become more scattering  when  R = 0.3 -0.5 m, 
due to cell  coalesc ences , see Fig. 7(c). For case I ( φ: 1→0), the maximum cell size reaches about 
22 mm at R =0.3 m (correspond ing to φ = 0.42) , where  the detonation extinction happens.  
 
4.3. Hydrodynamic  structure   
We will further discuss  the hydrodynamic thickness variations in expanding cylindrical 
detonation s. The hydrodynamic  thickness is the distance between the sonic plane  and the shock 
front  (Lee & Radulescu  2005 ). In case B, a self -sustaining diverging detonat ion is generated. Figure 
22 shows the time  sequence  of shock -frame Mach number  in this case . They are from four stages, 
i.e., overdrive (5 -45 μs), cell formation (5 4-78 μs), growing (100 -170 μs), and diverging stages 
(195 -238 μ s). At 5 μs, an overdriven de tonation propagates outwardly from the hotspot, and behind 
it a sub -sonic region exists. This subsonic region is further elongated radially at 20 -45 μs, which 31 makes the detonation more susceptible to rarefaction effects from its behind . At 20 μs, the f low 
field behind the detonation is separated into three regions , marked by a, b, and c. Specifically, in 
region a, the dissipation of the hotspot happens, and the gradually reduced Ma is ascribed to the 
increasing flow speed. Regions b and c are the burned zone of the deflagration and detonation, 
respectively. All three regions increase as the detonation expand s. Consequently, the transverse 
disturbance, which is intensified by the curv ature, renders the detonation cellularized at 45 μs (Han 
et al.  2017) .

At 54 μs, the detonation cellularization becomes more pronounced , accompanied by  some 
scattere d supersonic pockets behind the detonation wave . The effect of the expansion waves on 
detonation front varies at different circumferential positions . Since the expansion  waves  cannot  
penetrate the supersonic  pocket to attenuate  the detonation  (Weber & Olivier 2003) , the local 
detonation front s ahead of the supersonic pockets show higher speed, as shown in the circled 
regions. Meanwhile, there  is an increase d Mach number  behind t he leading shock  due to the 
decreas ed flow speed  at 54-78 μs. Especially , a super sonic ring is generated from the subsonic 
region b with two extra sonic lines.  At 78 μs, more  small supersonic zones are generated behind the 
detonation front , indicating  the enhancement  of the hydrodynamic fluctuations . This fluctuation 
applied  to the  expansion wave further influence s the local detonation intensity, and eventually 
promotes the formation of the triple -point structure  of the detonation front; see the red circles at 78 
μs. 
At the cell growing stage (100 -170 μs), the localized  supersonic pockets  gradually coalesce 
with each other,  and are extend ed to the entire subsonic zone. At 170 μs, a relatively clear sonic 
region  appears immediately  behind the SF. Furthermore,  the hydrodynamic thickness becomes 
constant over the time , indicating the formation of  the freely propagating cylindrical  detonation . It 
is reported in  Ref. (Radulescu  et al. 2007 ) that t he mechanical and thermal fluctuations decays from 
a large magnitude (6 -10%)  close to the shock front to a negligible intensity  (0.5-1%) at the sonic 
surface. T herefore , the disturbance behind the sonic plane has little effect s on the detonation  front , 
and the detonation  evolution is only governed by the available energy release and product expansion 
between the sonic plane and leading shock  (Lee & Radulescu  2005 ).

Fig. 2 2(j). White line: Ma = 1. Blue line: RF.  
 
At the cell diverging stage (195 -238 μs), the subsonic zone only appears  between the leading 
shock and sonic plane as a “sawtooth” pattern. This is due to the combined effects of transverse 
wave, incident shock and Mach stem  (Radulescu  et al.  2007 ). Figure s 23(a) and 23(b) shows the 
enlarged Mach number contour (the Ma range a djusted to 0 -1.2) and the temperature distribution 
from the box in Fig. 2 2(j). In the subsonic zone, the Mach number is nearly constant behind the 
incident shock , except for the induction zone where the Mach number is higher due to lower 
temperature, as shown in Fig. 2 3(b). However, behind the Mach stem, the Mach number increase s 
towards  the sonic plane. This is because  rapid reaction s take place immediately after the Mach stem, 
which dramatically raises  the local temperature and flow speed. A distinct Ma discontinuity exists  
at the interface of post -MS and post-IS products due to the transverse wave s. Owning to the 
different expansion of post -MS and post -IS product s, the sonic plane shows convex behind MS , 
whilst concave behind IS, which leads to  the “sawtooth” pattern of the sonic plane.

Figure 2 4 shows the time  sequence of the Mach number in case I, in which the detonation  is 
ultimately quenched as the equivalence ratio approaches zero. Overall , the shock Mach number 
gradually decrease s when it runs outwardly . At 87 μs, an overdriven detonation with small cell s is 
generated. As a result, the subsonic region behind the leading shock is relative ly long (about 30  
mm). From 113 -142 μs, plenty of supersonic pockets  occur in the subsonic region just like 73 -78 
μs in Fig. 2 2. However, generation and coalescing of the supersonic spot do not make the subsonic 
region shrink; i nstead, the subsonic region is further elongated due to the weakened shock intensity 
at 142 μs. Further downstream the detonation decays to an inert shock with relatively smooth front 
at 175 μs.

2 1 0Shock-frame Ma35 5. Conclusions  
Two-dimensional cylindrical detonation  direct  initiation in hydrogen/air  mixture s are 
computationally studied. The effec ts of hotspot propert y and mixture composition gradient on 
detonation initiation are studied.  The m ain conclusions are summarized as below.  
(1) For nonreactive hotspot, initiation fails for low hotspot pressure ( ps = 100 p0 or 150 p0) and 
critical regime dominates for high hotspot pressure ( ps = 200 p0 or 250 p0) in which three stages occurs, 
including no cell, growing cell and diverging cell. Supercritical regime dominates for both reactive 
hotspot (H 2+O 2 or H2+air, ps = 100 p0). Detonation is directly initiated from  the react ive hotspot , whilst 
it is initiated  somewhere beyond the nonreactive hotspot through the coupling of the  leading shock 
and reaction front . 
(2) The detonation cell size increases almost linearly with the radius at the cell-growing stage, 
which implies that the cell -family number of the cellular detonation determines the growth rate of cell 
size in a cylindrical detonation . Furthermore,  cell diverging only occurs as the local cell size exceeds 
the characteristic cell siz e of a certain value.  
(3) Two cell diverging patterns are identified , i.e., abrupt and gradual  pattern s, respectively. 
The abrupt  diverging is attributed to the generation and intensification of the instability as the cell 
grows, whilst the gradual diverging is mainly caused by the instability amplification during the 
interactions between two adjacent shocks. Besides, the cell coalescence occurs if much irregular 
cells initially form and the cell wit h smaller cell thickness merges to the bigger one as the detonation 
expands.  As such, the cell -family number is reduced and the local cell s grow faster, which leads to an 
earlier diverging behavior.  
(4) As the mixture ER  decreases linearly from unity  at the hotspot vicinity to a certain value  at R 
= 0.5 m , the detonation experiences self -sustained propagation, highly unstable  propagation (with local 
extinction) , and global  extinction with ER: 1→0.9, 1→0.5 and 1→0, respectively . In particular, highly  
unstable detonation arises from multiple cell coalescences , and detonation extinction occurs where the 
induction time is highly lengthened and unburned pockets occur .  36 (5) Hydrodynamic structure analysis is also conducted  for both uniform and nonuniform m ixtures . 
For a self -sustaining detonation case (air hotspot, ps = 100 p0), the hydrodynamic thickness first 
increases at the overdrive stage , then decreases as the detonation cells are generated , and eventually 
reaches  almost  a constant at the cell diverging stage in which the sonic plane exhibits a “sawtooth” 
pattern . This is ascribed to the different expansion of post -MS and post -IS products . For detonation 
extinction case ( φ: 1→0), hydrodynamic thickness continuously increases from the overdrive n state  to 
extinction and no “sawtooth” sonic plane occurs  since no self -sustaining detonation is generated .
