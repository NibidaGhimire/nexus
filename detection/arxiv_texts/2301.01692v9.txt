Lattice regularization of the theory of gravity provides a n ew possibility for study of the Big Bang
problem. In the 4D lattice theories of gravity, the existenc e of a high-temperature phase is proved,
which is characterized by the folding of space into a point an d zeroing of the energy-momentum
tensor. The existence of a low-temperature phase in the long -wave limit is also shown, the geometric
properties of which and its dynamics correspond to known con cepts: the expansion of the Universe
ﬁrst follows an exponential law, and then smoothly transiti ons to a power-law regime.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the works of the author [1–5] a model of discrete gravity on a sim plicial complex was studied. This model
included pure gravity degrees of freedom (tetrads, connection) , as well as a fermion Dirac ﬁeld minimally coupled to
gravity. In particular, in the work [5] a discrete symmetry Z2of the action called PT symmetry was described. This
PT transformation changes the sign of all tetrads and mutually inte rchanges the Dirac variables with their Hermitian
conjugates, that is, mutually interchanges particles and antipart icles.
In this work, we take the next step: we show that at ultrahigh temp eratures the PT symmetry is not broken, but it
is broken at suﬃciently low temperatures. In the high-temperatur e phase, the mean values of the energy-momentum
tensor of matter, as well as the mean values of the tetrads, are e qual to zero. On the contrary, in the low-temperature
phase these values are diﬀerent from zero. Tetrad is an order par ameter.
As is known, in the Minimal Standard Model (MSM) the number of ferm ionic degrees of freedom is multiple than
the number of bosonic degrees of freedom (even taking into accou nt two gravitons). It follows that the total energy
of vacuum zero-point oscillations is negative. We assume that some p roperties of the MSM near the point of the
Big Bang can be described using the discrete gravity model being stu died. Here we are interested in the following
question: can the continuation of solutions to Einstein’s continuum e quations in the vicinity of the Big Bang point
contain some information about the properties of the high-temper ature phase in the lattice theory? To answer this
question, we solve Einstein’s equations in the spirit of Friedmann’s mod el, but with a bare cosmological constant
of positive sign. The positive cosmological constant compensates f or the enormous negative energy of the vacuum.
And since we consider the continuum theory as the long-wave limit of t he discrete theory of gravity, then all the
quantities in the equations (vacuum energy density ε, the bare cosmological constant Λ 0, etc.) are ﬁnite. In this case,
Einstein’s equations and their solutions aremathematically correct. Moreover,the solutions obtained demonstrate the
necessary properties common to cosmology: near the point of the Big Bang, an exponential expansion regime of the
Universe takes place (inﬂation phase), but then the expansion swit ches to a power-law regime. It is also interesting
that in the solution found, the vacuum energy modulus |ε|decreases as we approach the Big Bang point. In other
words, the energy-momentum tensor of matter in the continuum t heory tends to zero when approaching the Big Bang
point. In our opinion, this trend suggests that the Einstein continu um equation under consideration actually models
a discrete theory of gravity in the long-wave limit. However, one mus t keep in mind that as the absolute value of the
energy-momentum tensor decreases, the role of quantum ﬂuctu ations increases, and the classical Einstein equations
become inapplicable (see Section IV).
The article is organized as follows.
Since diﬀerent variants of simplicial theories of gravity are discusse d, for ease of reading we deﬁne the variant
studied here in Section II.

Section III proves the main result of the work: in the lattice theory of gravity, discrete PT symmetry is not broken
at ultrahigh temperatures. But at low temperatures, spontaneo us breaking of this symmetry occurs.
Section IV considers the solution of the Einstein equation within the F riedmann paradigm in the long-wave limit.
This considerationmakes sense, since the lattice theory transfor msinto the ordinarytheoryof gravityin the long-wave
limit. It is shown that the solution of classical equations is possible only at some distance from the point of the Big
Bang. The reason for this is that as one approaches the singularity , quantum ﬂuctuations become signiﬁcant.
Section V provides some thermodynamic considerations.
This work is of a model nature.
II. INTRODUCTION TO LATTICE THEORY OF GRAVITY
A. Lattice theory deﬁnition
To go further, it is necessary to formulate the variant of the theo ry of gravity on a lattice, which we will use. For
a more detailed description of this theory, see [1–5]
This subsection uses the Euclidean signature. Denote by γa4×4 Hermitian Dirac matrices, so that
γaγb+γbγa= 2δab, σab≡1
4[γa,γb], a= 1,2,3,4, γ5≡γ1γ2γ3γ4= (γ5)†. (2.1)
Consider the orientable abstract 4-dimensional simplicial complex K. Suppose that any of its 4-simplexes belongs
to such a ﬁnite (or inﬁnite) sub-complex K′∈Kwhich has a geometric realization in R4topologically equivalent to a
disk without cavities. The vertices are designated as aV, the indicesV= 1,2,...,N(0)→∞andWenumerate the
vertices and 4-simplices, correspondingly. It is necessary to use t he local enumeration of the vertices aVattached to
a given 4-simplex: the all ﬁve vertices of a 4-simplex with index Ware enumerated as aV(W)i,i= 1,2,3,4,5. The
later notations with extra low index ( W) indicate that the corresponding quantities belong to the 4-simplex with
indexW. Note that a quantity belonging to the 4-simplex s4
Wcan also belong to the neighboring 4-simplex s4
W′if
these 4-simplices have common simplices of lower dimension. The Levi-C ivita symbol with in pairs diﬀerent indexes

the convergence of the functional integral of the partition func tion. By this limitation imposed on the tetrad, the
present work diﬀers from the author’s previous works on the theo ry of diskette gravity. The conjecture is that the
set of variables{Ω,ˆe}is an independent set of dynamic variables. Fermionic degrees of fre edom (Dirac spinors) are
assigned to each vertex of the complex:

The considered lattice model is invariant with respect to the global d iscreteZ2symmetry, which is an analog of
the combined PT-symmetry. Let ˆUPTdenote the operator of this transformation. Then the transfor med dynamic

B. The long-wavelength limit
Let’s pass on to the long-wave limit, that is, to the limit of ﬁelds that slo wly change when moving along the lattice.
In this limit, the action (2.4) transforms into the well-known continuu m Palatini action plus the contribution of the
cosmological constant, and the Dirac ﬁeld turns out to be minimally co upled to gravity. This transformation have
meaning togetherwith the transition to Minkowskisignature. As a r esult the compact gaugegroup Spin(4) transforms
into the non-compact group Spin(3 ,1). In this section, all lattice quantities for the Euclidean signature are primed.
For the quantities related to the Minkowski signature, the previou s designations are retained.
For the indicated transformation of the action, the following defor mations of the integration contours in the integral
(2.10) are necessary:
ω′4α
V1V2=iω0α
V1V2, ω′αβ
V1V2=−ωαβ
V1V2,
e′4
V1V2=e0
V1V2, e′α
V1V2=ieα
V1V2. (2.17)
The variables ωab
Wij,ea
Wijare real quantities for Minkowski signature, and the indices take o n the values
a, b...= 0,1,2,3, α, β,... = 1,2,3. (2.18)
The Dirac matrices are transformed as follows:
γ′4=γ0, γ′α=iγα, γ′5=γ5=iγ0γ1γ2γ3,
1
2(γaγb+γbγa) =ηab= diag(1 ,−1,−1,−1),trγ5γaγbγcγd= 4iεabcd, ε0123= 1. (2.19)
Thus, for σab= (1/4)[γa, γb] we get
σ′4α=iσ0α, σ′αβ=−σαβ. (2.20)
Raising and lowering indices a,b,...is done using tensors ηabandηab, respectively. As a result of (2.17)-(2.20) we
have
ω′V1V2=1
2ωab
V1V2σab≡ωV1V2,ˆe′

We see that the holonomy elements Ω V1V2become the elements of the non-compact group Spin(3 ,1).
Dirac variables are transformed according to
Ψ′
V= ΨV,Ψ′†
V= Ψ†
Vγ0=ΨV. (2.23)
in passing to the Minkowski signature.
The transition to the long-wave limit is possible for such ﬁeld conﬁgura tions that change quite slowly during
transitions from simplex to simplex, that is, with small or signiﬁcant mo vements along the lattice. This rule applies
to any grating. In our theory, it is precisely at the stage of transit ion to the long-wavelimit that the need to introduce
local coordinates arises. Local coordinates are the markers of t he lattice vertices. Consider some 4D subcomplex
K′∈Kwith the trivial topology of a four-dimensional disk and geometric re alization in R4. Thus, each vertex of the
subcomplex acquires coordinates xµ, which are the coordinates of the image of the vertex in R4:
xµ
V≡xµ(aV), µ= 1,2,3,4. (2.24)
At this stage, the coordinates are dimensionless, that is, real num bers. Let’s consider some simplex s4
W∈K′. Let us
denote all ﬁve vertices of this 4-simplex as Vi,i= 1,2,3,4 andVm∝ne}ationslash=Vi. The properties of the geometric realization
are such that four inﬁnitesimal vectors
dxµ
VmVi≡xµ
Vi−xµ
Vm=−dxµ
ViVm∈R4, i= 1,2,3,4 (2.25)5
are linearly independent.
In the works [1–5] it is proven that there are 1-forms in R4ωµ(x) and ˆeµ(x) such that the equalities
ωµ/parenleftbigg1
2(xVm+xVi)/parenrightbigg
dxµ
VmVi=ωVmVi, (2.26)
ˆeµ/parenleftbigg1
2(xVm+xVi)/parenrightbigg
dxµ
VmVi= ˆeVmVi. (2.27)
are true. It is further assumed that the 1-forms smoothly depen d on points in R4that are images of the vertices of the
complex. In the long-wave limit, the elements Ω VmViare close to unity and, up to O/parenleftbig

(2.28)
holds, where
Rµν=∂µων−∂νωµ+[ωµ, ων]. (2.29)

All other terms in such a transition will contain additional factors in t he positive power ( lP/λ)−→0, and therefore
they are omitted. Here λis the characteristic wavelength of the physical subsystem. This s ituation is typical when
going to the long-wave limit in any lattice theory.
For clarity, let us point out the fact that on the lattice all variables a nd constants are dimensionless and of order
one. In particular, the constant l′
P∼1 in (2.5) and (2.9) is dimensionless, as are the diﬀerentials dxµ
VmViin (2.25).
When moving to dimensional quantities, we assume
dxµ
VmVi=dxµ/lP∼1, (2.33)
where the diﬀerential dxµis measured in centimeters and lP∼10−32cm (see (4.7)). From (2.33) it is clear that
the step of the irregular lattice has a size of the order of lP. And at the same time, all components of the action
are dimensionless, but variables and constants acquire dimension. F or example, in the term (2.32) the cosmological
constant is Λ 0∼l−2
P.
The action (2.30)-(2.32) is a Hilbert-Einstein action, minimally related t o the Dirac ﬁeld and written in Palatini
form. It is invariant under diﬀeomorphisms. This fact is not accident al, since in (2.24) the very method of introducing
coordinates is such that already at this stage the independence of the action from the arbitrariness of introduced
coordinates is visible. It is important that small terms in the long-wav e limit, proportional to positive powers of
(lP/λ), are also invariant under diﬀeomorphisms. Indeed, when expandin g the action (2.4) in terms of the parameter
lP, which does not depend on the coordinates, all the coeﬃcients at t he powers of this parameter will also be
independent on the coordinates.
In the Minkowski signature, the PT-symmetry of the action is dete rmined by the formulas (2.13)-(2.14), (2.16) with
the only diﬀerence that in these formulas the replacement should be made Ψ†−→Ψ.6
III. SUPERHIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE LATTICE MODEL OF GRAVITY
Let us consider the state of lattice theory at ultrahigh temperatu res. As is known, in quantum theory, the partition
function trexp(−βH) diﬀers from the transition amplitude over a ﬁnite time ∆ t, represented as a functional integral,
by the transition to imaginary time ∆ t=−iβ,β= 1/T, and taking the trace. We must study some properties of the
partition function (2.10) in the case of ultra-high temperatures, t hat is,β−→0.
When applied to the lattice theory studied here, this means the follow ing.
Suppose that a 4D lattice has two 3D sublattices Σ 1and Σ 2that form its boundary. For simplicity, we assume that
between Σ 1and Σ 2there are N <∞4D lattice layers, each one edge thick. The sublattices Σ 1and Σ 2are considered
identical, that is, there is a one-to-one correspondence between all elements of these sublattices. The last property
makes it possible to calculate the partition function.
Let Φ1ξand Φ 2ξdenote the holomorphic functions of fermion variables with real coe ﬃcients deﬁned on Σ 1and
Σ2, respectively. To calculate the trace in fermionic variables, it is nece ssary to use the full set of holomorphic wave
functions Φ 1ξ≡Φ1ξ{Ψ†
V}, and their Hermitian conjugate functions Φ†
2ξ≡/parenleftBig
Φ2ξ{Ψ†
V}/parenrightBig†
= Φ2ξ{ΨV}. Here the index
ξlists the independent wave functions from their complete set. The f unctional
Φ†
2ξexp(βA)Φ1ξ (3.1)
should be placed under the integral (2.10) and the sum over ξtaken. In the integral (2.10) on the identiﬁed 1-simplices
belonging to Σ 1and Σ 2, the variables{Ω}and{ea}must be identiﬁed .
We are interested in the case β≪1. We intend to prove that discrete PT symmetry (2.13)-(2.16) is no t broken at
ultrahigh temperatures.
The following Statement holds:
Statement 1 . In a certain ﬁnite neighborhood of the point β= 0, the free energy of the partition function (2.10),
with the exception of the term of the form ( −(C1·M+4NνΨ)·lnβ) (see (3.9)), is a holomorphic function of the
variable β. All symmetries of the action (2.4), including discrete PT symmetries , are preserved. /square
Let us give some arguments in favor of the Statement 1. Let us con sider the high-temperature expansion of the
partition function in the 2D Ising model, which is the sum over all closed paths with self-intersections on the lattice.
Let the lattice contain L−→∞edges and let a path (possibly several non-intersecting paths) wit h a total of ledges
be ﬁxed on it. Note that lis an even number and l≥4. When calculating the partition function, it is convenient to
isolate the factor (cosh β)L, which does not give a singularity in the free energy. Then each edge of the path should
be assigned a weight (tanh β). Letglbe the number of such closed paths. We have a strict inequality
gl<L!
l!(L−l)!, (3.2)
since the number on the right side of the inequality (3.2) also includes t he number of all non-closed paths of weight
(tanhβ)l. Therefore, the Ising partition function Z
Z/(coshβ)L= 1+/summationdisplay
lgl(tanhβ)l<L/summationdisplay
l=0L!
l!(L−l)!(tanhβ)l
= (1+tanh β)L≡ZM. (3.3)
This shows that the speciﬁc free energy per edge fM=−lnZM/L=−ln(1+tanh β) is a holomorphic function in a
ﬁnite neighborhood of the point β= 0 and in the case of L−→∞. This observation is a consequence of the fact that
the quantity ZMis essentially local for small β, that is, eﬀectively ZMis the product of local holomorphic functions.
In other words, there is no long-range order at small β. But if open contours are eliminated from the sum ZM, then
long-range order will not arise. However, the size of the holomorph y neighborhood may change. This means that the
limitf=−lnZ/LatL−→∞exists. Indeed, the value on the left side (3.3) can be represented as
Z/(coshβ)L= [1+ρ(tanhβ)]L, (3.4)
and the holomorphic function ρ(tanhβ)→0 forβ→0. That’s why
f=−lncoshβ−ln[1+ρ(tanhβ)] (3.5)7
is a holomorphic function in some ﬁnite neighborhood of the point β= 0.
Similar reasoning can be carried out in the case of a partition function (2.10), although this case is qualitatively
more complicated. Both the fermion and bosonic integrals in (2.10) ar e well deﬁned. Let us consider qualitatively the
results of these integrations.
LetN−→∞andνΨdenote the numbers of vertices of the complex and Dirac ﬁelds, res pectively. Integration into
(2.10) over the Dirac ﬁeld gives the factor under the remaining integ rals of the form
β4NνΨP{Ω,ea}, (3.6)
whereP{Ω,ea}is a gauge-invariant homogeneous polynomial of the variables Ω and eaof degrees 4 NνΨand 12NνΨ,
respectively.
Next, we consider integrals over bosonic variables. First we conside r integration over the connection variables Ω.
Let the polynomial P{Ω,ea}contain a variable Ω V1V2to an odd power. Integral (/integraltext
dµ{ΩV1V2}...) of the tensor
product of an odd number of elements Ω V1V2is equal to zero. Let us expand the exponential into terms contain ing the
element Ω V1V2. Let us assume that as a result of a ﬁnite number of such steps (fo r a ﬁnite subcomplex) we will have
a tensor product of an even number of elements Ω V1V2on each 1-simplex aV1aV2. Therefore, as a result of integration
over the gauge group, the ﬁrst nonzero term will receive an additio nal factor βC·M, whereM→∞is the number of
1-simplices of the complex and 0 ≤C∼1. All other terms of this expansion, as a result of integration over the gauge
group, give an additional gauge invariant term F{ea;β}in the partition function. This term is a functional of the
variables{ea}and a well-converging holomorphic function of the parameter βin the neighborhood of zero, and
F{ea;β}
βC·M+4NνΨ→0 asβ→0.
There are only two types of invariants relative to gauge transform ations (2.11) associated with a vertex aV:
ea
VV1ea
VV2, (3.7)
εabcdea
VV1eb
VV2ec
VV3ed
VV4. (3.8)
In (3.7) the vertices aV1andaV2are not necessarily diﬀerent, and in (3.8) the 1-simplices ( aVaV1), (aVaV2), (aVaV3),
(aVaV4) do not necessarily belong to the same 4-simplex.
Let us brieﬂy consider the integral over variables {ea}. Note that if under the integral there is an expression (3.7)
to the ﬁrst degree and it does not intersect with other similar expre ssions, then the integral is identically equal to
zero. A similar statement holds for the expression (3.8). Therefor e, under the integral the expressions (3.7) and (3.8)
must be in such powers and combinations that the variables ea
V1V2on each 1-simplex are in an even power (including
zero). For this purpose, expansion of the exponential in (3.1) in th e contribution to the action βAΛ0(see (2.9)) may
be necessary.
The action (2.4) is local, that is, it consists of terms (local operator s), each of which is deﬁned on the nearest
lattice elements. Let’s call one of these operators A, and the other B, and we will assume that the operators Aand
Bare separated by a considerable distance along the lattice. Conside r the correlator∝an}b∇acketle{tAB∝an}b∇acket∇i}ht. For this correlator to be
non-zero, it is necessary to expand the exponential in these oper ators so that between the operators AandBthere
is a suﬃcient number of adjacent local operators. But such an exp ansion will give the parameter β≪1 to a fairly
high degree, at least proportional to the number of 1-simplices bet weenAandB, and with a coeﬃcient of the order
of unity. Therefore, the partition function in the high-temperatu re phase is local in nature.
Let us draw a conclusion from the above consideration. At ultrahigh temperature ( β= 1/T−→0) the integral
for the partition function (2.10) is a holomorphic function in a neighbo rhood of the point β= 0 and has the form
(compare with (3.4))
Z= Const·βC1·M+4NνΨ(1+f(β))C2·M,
f(β)→0 asβ→0, C1∼C2∼1. (3.9)
This implies the validity of the Statement 1. In turn, it follows from the Statement1 that in the high-temperature
phase no symmetries are broken, including discrete PT symmetry.
Based on the validity of the Statement 1, we will begin to calculate the averages of some operators.8
The discrete PT transformation (2.13)-(2.16) does not change th e measure and integrand (except, perhaps, the
averaged value), but swaps the initial and ﬁnal states:

Here, a prime above the wave function symbol means that it is PT-tr ansformed. From the last equality it is clear
that the initial and ﬁnal wave functions are swapped as a result of t he PT transformation, and their scalar product
is preserved. This means that the operator ˆUPTis anti-unitary.
According to the general rule, the integral does not change when the integration variables are changed. In our
case, the integral over the fermionic and tetrad variables and the sum over the fermionic states ξare of interest. The
integral overthe connection variables {Ω}should be excluded. Otherwise, further reasoningwill be meaningles s. Let’s
consider two integrals.

HereN{Ω}is a normalizing constant, the integral is calculated only over the tet rad and Dirac ﬁeld variables, but
not over the connection variables. If the integration also included a n integral over the variables {Ω}, then any gauge-
non-invariant quantity under the integral, like Θa
V1V2, would turn into zero identically. But the integral (3.11) is
meaningful, since the gauge is ﬁxed in it. In (3.11), the ﬁrst equality is the deﬁnition of the average value, the second
equality is a consequence of the Statement 1, the third and fourth equalities are consequences of the equalities (3.10)
and (2.16), respectively.
The main conclusion of this work follows from the chain of equalities (3.1 1):

A comparison of the equations (3.12) and (3.13) shows that in the lat tice theory of gravity coupled with the Dirac
ﬁeld, there is a phase transition in temperature.
The phase transition from a phase with a zero value of the average v alue Θa
µto a phase with a non-zero value of
this value and the physical signiﬁcance of this transition were consid ered in the work [7]. The work of [8] may also be
interesting in this regard.9
IV. EINSTEIN EQUATION AND SOLUTION
Here the standard spatially ﬂat Robertson-Walker metric
ds2=dt2−a2(t)(dxα)2, α= 1,2,3 (4.1)
is used,H= ˙a/ais Hubble parameter and a(t) is the cosmic scale factor. We assume c= 1. Appropriate remarks are
made in formulas with restored dimension.
First of all, we will show that at the end of the inﬂation process and fu rther, vacuum quantum ﬂuctuations are
insigniﬁcant when describing the dynamics of macroscopic regions of space and the matter contained in them.
Our approach assumes that all physical quantities are determined by taking into account vacuum quantum zero
point ﬂuctuations. In particular, the energy density and pressur e are mainly determined by quantum ﬂuctuations. It
is well known [9] that the following simultaneous commutation relations for the components of the energy-momentum
tensor take place in the Minkowski space:
/bracketleftbig
T00(x),T00(y)/bracketrightbig
=−i/planckover2pi1/parenleftbig
T0k(x)+T0k(y)/parenrightbig
∂kδ(3)(x−y)+Schwinger terms , (4.2)
and so on. The Schwinger terms are the higher derivatives of the δ-functions and are not of interest here. The
same commutation relations take place in a curved space if they are w ritten near the center of Riemann’s normal
coordinates.
Let us denote by lPthe minimum possible size on the lattice, which we will call the Planck size. Thenδ(3)(0)∼l−3
P.
Thus we ﬁnd, using (4.2) and the well-known rule, the order of quant um ﬂuctuations of the energy density ∆ εat
wavelengths λ≫lP:
∆ε∼/radicalBigg
/planckover2pi1|ε|
l3
Pλ,∆ε
|ε|∼/radicalBigg
/planckover2pi1
l3
Pλ|ε|. (4.3)
In the modern era and also at the end of the inﬂation phase, the vac uum temperature Tvac∼/planckover2pi1H(see Section V)
is very small compared to the maximum (modulo) particle energy in the Dirac sea|ǫ|∼/planckover2pi1/lP. It follows that the
vacuum energy density |ε|∼/planckover2pi1/l4
P, and we obtain the estimation
∆ε/|ε|∼/radicalbig
lP/λ∼10−16forλ∼1cm, lP∼10−32cm. (4.4)
Note that, provided that the long-wave limit is valid, it makes sense to assumeλ/a∼const1,lP/a∼const2, and
therefore lP/λ∼const. Therefore the assessment (4.4) remains valid over a very w ide range, including a signiﬁcant
part of the inﬂation phase. This shows that the use of Einstein’s clas sical equations to describe macroscopic dynamics
in the modern era is justiﬁed. However, when approachingthe Big Ba ng point, the vacuum temperature becomes very
high, as a result of which the energy density |ε|quickly decreases in absolute value due to the population of positive
energy levels by fermions. Estimates (4.3) and (4.4) become unsatis factory, and in the situation ∆ ε/|ε|∼1 classical
equations are unsuitable, the dynamics become purely quantum. A d etailed study of the boundary of the transition
from classical to quantum dynamics is not included in the scope of this work.
Let us demonstrate the tendency of the average energy of the s ystem to zero with increasing temperature using a
simple example. Consider one Fermi particle, which can be in only two st ates with energies ±ǫ. Suppose that the
particle is placed in a thermostat, so its chemical potential is zero an d the temperature Ttends to inﬁnity ( ǫ/T−→0).
Thenε=< ǫ >−→0.
A. Solution of Einstein’s equations with bare cosmological constant
We assume that the energy-momentum tensor of an ideal relativist ic ﬂuid is suitable for solving the problem posed:
Ta
b= (ε+p)UaUb−pδa
b. (4.5)
We work in an orthonormal basis in which the metric tensor ηab= diag(1 ,−1,−1,−1). On the right side of (4.5),
the symbols εandpdenote the energy density and pressure, respectively, and thes e quantities also include vacuum
energy and pressure. Since fermion ﬁelds, in contrast to bosonic o nes, make a negative contribution to the vacuum
energy, but there are signiﬁcantly more fermionic degrees of free dom than bosonic ones, we have ε <0. Moreover,
lattice regularization means that |ε|,|p|<∞.Uais the averaged 4-velocity of the macroscopic regions of the lattice .10
In our case Ua= (1,0,0,0). To compensate for the vacuum energy, a bare ﬁnite positive co smological constant Λ 0is
introduced into the Einstein equation:
Ra
b−1
2δa
bR= 8πGTa
b+Λ0δa
b. (4.6)
In lattice theory, the cosmological constant is introduced in a natu ral way (see (2.9)). We assume that the bare
cosmological constant (with restored dimension)
Λ0= const∼l−2
P, lP∼/radicalbigg
8πG/planckover2pi1
c3∼10−32cm. (4.7)
Note that the bare cosmological constant on the lattice (2.9) is dime nsionless, like all other constants and variables,
and it is of the order of unity.
For the metric, we use ansatz (4.1). In order not to clutter up the formulas, we introduce the notation
8πGε= ˜ε,8πGp= ˜p. (4.8)
All components of the Einstein equation are reduced to two equatio ns:
3˙a2
a2= Λ0+ ˜ε,2¨a
a+˙a2
a2= Λ0−˜p. (4.9)
Another equation ∇aTa
b= 0 is a consequence of equations (4.9), and therefore it does not n eed to be considered.
With the help of the Hubble parameter H(t) Eqs. (4.9) are rewritten as follows:
2˙H+(˜ε+ ˜p) = 0,3H2−(Λ0+ ˜ε) = 0. (4.10)
So we have 3 unknown functions {˜ε(t),˜p(t),H(t)}and 2 equations (4.10). The missing equation is the equation of
state relating energy density and pressure. The following facts ar e known regardingthe equation of state of relativistic
matter: (i) in the case of real dust-like matter p= 0; (ii) in the case of real ultrarelativistic matter p=ε/3; (iii) in the
case of the energy density and vacuum pressure in de Sitter space p=−ε. In all three cases, the energy density and
pressure are linearly related. In addition, these quantities have th e same dimensionality. Therefore, for the energy
density and pressure, including vacuum values, we accept the follow ing hypothesis of a linear relation:
˜p=κΛ0+(κ−1)˜ε←→˜ε+ ˜p=κ(˜ε+Λ0). (4.11)
This equation is linear and inhomogeneous with an unknown dimensionles s function κ(t), the asymptotics of which
are further determined based on the known dynamics. The set of e quations (4.10) and (4.11) has a solution:

. (4.14)
HereH0is the integration constant which plays the role of the Hubble parame ter at the beginning of the inﬂation
phase. The moment t0>0 is the conditional moment of the beginning of the inﬂation phase.
From solutions (4.12)-(4.14) it is clear that case (i) corresponds to the value κ(t) = 1, case (ii) — the value
κ(t) = 4/3, and case (iii) — the value κ(t) = 0.
We indicate some of the most obvious properties of the solution (4.12 ), (4.13), (4.14). The estimates given below
are very rough. Let us accept the following estimates for the dura tion of the inﬂation time tinf, and for the constant
Λ0:
tinf∼=10−37s, H0∼=1039s−1. (4.15)11
In (4.15) dimension is restored. Then H0tinf∼=100.
Estimates of the Hubble parameter in the inﬂation phase diﬀer great ly in diﬀerent sources. We adopted the value
H∼1.7·1015GeV, which is equivalent to the value (4.15) [10]. In the paper [11] the v alue of the Hubble parameter
at the end of the inﬂation phase is estimated as√
GH <10−5. This value corresponds to H∼1038cm−1, which is
close to the value (4.15).
Let us take κ(t0)∼=1/150 and assume that during time tinfthe function κchanges insigniﬁcantly. This assumption
means (see the ﬁrst of Eq. (4.12)) that in the inﬂation phase |˙H|≪H2. The last inequality is a necessary condition
for inﬂation [12]. Then in the time interval t0< t < t 0+tinfthe solutions (4.12), (4.13), (4.14) take the form
H(t)∼=H0,˜ε(t)∼=−˜p∼=−Λ0+3H2
0. (4.16)
Thus, during inﬂation, the scale factor a(t) increased by (exp H0tinf)≈(exp100)≈1043times.
Assume that when t > t0+tinf, the function κ(t) becomes equal to κ= 4/3. In this case, the solutions (4.12),
(4.13), (4.14) give a power-law expansion:
H(t)∼=1
2t,˜ε(t)∼=−Λ0+3
4t2,˜p∼=Λ0+1
4t2. (4.17)
Solution (4.17) shows that the scale factor and the density of real matter change according to the well-known law, as
well as the correct equation of state in the case of ultrarelativistic matter (in (4.18) dimension restored):
a(t)∝√
t, ρreal=3
32πGt2, preal=1
3εreal. (4.18)
From the equalities (4.13) and (4.14) it is clear that as we approach th e point of the Big Bang, the quantities |˜ε|
and ˜pdecrease and become equal to
˜ε=−(Λ0−3H2
0),˜p= Λ0−3(1−κ(t0))H2
0fort=t0.
If we assume that at t−→0 we have κ−→0 and 3H2
0−→Λ0, then the energy-momentum tensor tend to zero at the
point of the Big Bang. However, it was shown above that such a cont inuation of the solution to the Big Bang point is
impossible due to the development of quantum ﬂuctuations. Nevert heless, the tendency towards an absolute decrease
in the energy-momentum tensor in the classical solution when appro aching the Big Bang point shows the consistency
of the presented classical and quantum approaches.
Let us estimate the temperature Tcof the phase transition that violates PT symmetry. For this, we use the result
of Volovik [13–16], who calculated the local temperature of the ”vac uum” in de Sitter space:
Tvac=/planckover2pi1H
π. (4.19)
Although in the theory under study the Hubble parameter, unlike in t he case of de Sitter space, is not constant, here
we will adopt the formula (4.19) to estimate the temperature (see a lso Section V).
It has been shown that at the phase transition point the classical E instein equations (4.10) are not valid. However,
we use them only for a qualitative estimation. Since at the phase tran sition point the mean of the fermion energy-
momentum tensor is zero ( ε= 0), then according to the second equation (4.10) we have Hc∼√Λ0. From here and
using (4.19), (4.7) we obtain the estimate:
Tc∼/planckover2pi1c
lP∼1018GeV,orTc∼1031K. (4.20)
The phase transition temperature can also be estimated as the ene rgy of the Dirac sea enclosed in the Planck volume
VP∼l3
P:Tc∼(/planckover2pi1c/l4
P)l3
P∼/planckover2pi1c/lP. This temperature is of the same order of magnitude as the temper ature of the
Grand Uniﬁcation.
Let us also estimate the temperature in degrees Kelvin at the beginn ing of the inﬂation phase, when according to
(4.15)H0∼1039s−1. Then
T0∼/planckover2pi1H0
k∼1028K. (4.21)12
B. A brief review of the divergent cosmological constant pro blem
The problem with the cosmological constant is that the energy dens ity of quantum zero-point ﬂuctuations of the
vacuum diverges as the fourth power of the cutoﬀ parameter, an d there is currently no generally accepted solution to
compensate for this enormous energy density.
It seems to us that in this Section above a possible solution to the pro blem is presented, which is correct in the case
when space-time has the property of granularity (lattice) on an ult ra-small scale. Indeed, the introduction of a ﬁnite
bare cosmological constant leads to a completely reasonable solutio n to Einstein’s equations: in the initial phase we
have an exponential expansion of the Universe (inﬂation regime), w hich turns into a known expansion according to a
power law in the regime of ultrarelativistic matter.
We consider it appropriate to give here a very brief and incomplete ov erview of attempts to solve the identiﬁed
problem within the framework of traditional quantum ﬁeld theory.
In the fundamental review [17] the following facts were stated reg arding the problem of divergent energy (divergent
cosmologicalconstant)ofthegroundstateinquantumﬁeldtheor y: (i)InﬂatMinkowskispace-time, thesedivergences,
generally speaking, take place, but in the case of supersymmetric t heories, the energies of the ground states strictly
vanish. (ii) In curved space-time, even in the case of supergravity , the cosmological constant diverges. (iii) The
superstring theory does not save the situation either.
Of the later and specialized works, we note the works [18–23]. In the se papers, eﬀorts were made to solve the
problem of the cosmological constant in detail, that is, through micr oscopic analysis. In particular, the probability of
the following process was calculated. Let there be a massive particle in the de Sitter space. This particle gives rise
to a pair of the same particles for a suﬃciently long period of time. This problem has been studied for both free and
interacting ﬁelds. A similar statement of the problem for massive cha rged particles in the case of a ﬂat space-time
in the presence of a constant electric ﬁeld leads to the creation of p article-antiparticle pair that weaken the initial
electric ﬁeld. In the case of de Sitter space, pair production also lea ds to a decrease in the cosmological constant
with time. Unfortunately, in these works there is no study of the re verse inﬂuence of quantized material ﬁelds on the
space-time geometry. It is possible that continued eﬀorts in this dir ection will lead to a solution to the problem of
the cosmological constant.
In the paper [24] the mean of the energy-momentum tensor of a qu antized scalar ﬁeld is calculated in the case of an
anisotropic metric, which is considered to be classical and variable in t ime. Regularization is carried out in the usual
way: the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tens or, calculated in the case of a stationary vacuum,
is subtracted from the obtained value.
The authors of the paper [25] study such models of ﬁeld theory whic h, although not supersymmetric, have the
same number of boson and fermion degrees of freedom. In this cas e, the divergences of the highest, fourth degree
are eliminated in the quantum mean of the energy-momentum tensor . It is shown what conditions the already
renormalized ﬁeld masses must satisfy in order to reduce all other d ivergences. This approach can be called a method
of ﬁne-tuning the theory, as a result of which the inﬁnite vacuum en ergy disappears.
The work [26] seems to us to be interesting and complementary to t he present work, since a bare cosmological
constant is also introduced in [26], and the reduction of the huge vac uum energy is a dynamic eﬀect, not a ﬁne-tuning
eﬀect.
Another interesting approach to solving the problem, using the mac roscopic thermodynamic ideology, is presented
in [27] (see there also references for the articles of F.R. Klinkhamer and G.E. Volovik). The main idea of this approach
is as follows. If the system comes to a state of thermodynamic equilib rium, then a large thermodynamic potential is
of interest. Let Ω be a large thermodynamic potential for the spat ial volume V. It is known that
Ω(β,µ,V) =−P(T,µ)V. (4.22)
In the case of thermal equilibrium (if it exists), the pressure on the right side of the equality (4.22) tends to zero,
since there is no external pressure at all. Further, the eﬀective e nergy-momentum tensor of matter is formed by the
potential (4.22). Therefore, the eﬀective energy density of mat ter, including the vacuum energy, under the condition
of thermal equilibrium is estimated as ε∼Ω/V−→0. Thus the problem of the divergent cosmological constant is
removed.
In the work [28] the use of the metric (4.1) is criticized due to the str ong ﬂuctuations of all ﬁelds on the Planck
scales of frequencies and wavelengths. This conclusion is made on th e basis of studying the correlators of the energy-
momentum tensor components constructed from quantized matt er ﬁelds. The calculation shows that even in the case
of free quantized ﬁelds, the vacuum average values of the energy -momentum tensor components and their ﬂuctuations
are of the same order and diverge as the fourth power of the cuto ﬀ momentum. The fact that the divergences of these
quantities are of the fourth order means that these divergences saturate on the scale of the cutoﬀ momentum. In other
words, exclusively high-frequency degrees of freedom contribut e to the discussed averages. Therefore, we draw the
following conclusion: if we describe the dynamics of any degrees of fr eedom that have frequencies and wave vectors13
much less than Planck’s, then the high-frequency ﬂuctuations disc ussed in [28] do not play a role in such dynamics.
Indeed, the correlators between the low-frequency and high-fr equency degrees of freedom are in fact equal to zero.
This justiﬁes the use of the metric (4.1) in the Einstein equations disc ussed above, as well as the assumption that the
energy-momentum tensor is uniform in space. However, these ass umptions become incorrect when the scale factor
and mean of the energy-momentum tensor components become sm all and the temperature becomes high enough (see
Section III).
V. THERMODYNAMIC CONSIDERATIONS
The purpose of this Section is to qualitatively understand the result of temperature calculation (4.19). It will be
shown that the local vacuum temperature in a dynamic Universe with a changing scale factor is always of the order
of/planckover2pi1H.
The estimation (4.15) means that
H2
0≪Λ0. (5.1)
It can be seen from Eq. (4.13) that the maximum frequencies of the degrees of freedom of matter in the modern era
are of the order of
|ωmax|∼/radicalbig
Λ0. (5.2)
Consider the time interval ∆ t/lessorsimilarH−1, for which we have
∆a/a∼H∆t/lessorsimilar1,∆t|ωmax|≫1. (5.3)
Taking into account Eq. (5.3), we can assume that for a time interva l ∆tthe thermodynamic equilibrium of the
vacuum degrees of freedom is realized. This assumption cannot be e xtended to those degrees of freedom whose
frequencies ∆ t|ω|/lessorsimilar1. But such degrees of freedom make a small contribution to the to tal energy-momentum tensor.
Thus, the degrees of freedom with frequencies in the interval
H0∼∆t−1≪|ω|<|ωmax| (5.4)
are in a state of thermal equilibrium or close to it.
The conclusion about the thermalization of vacuum degrees of free dom in the indicated frequency range (5.4) can be
supported by the following reasoning. There is no indication that the system under study is integrable. Therefore, the
dynamics of all distribution functions of the system must be describ ed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann
equation brings the system to a locally equilibrium state in time intervals commensurate with the inverse values of
the characteristic frequencies of the dynamic degrees of freedo m. This statement is true under the condition of an
insigniﬁcant change in external conditions during the process of es tablishing equilibrium. To fulﬁll the last condition,
it is necessary to satisfy the estimates (5.3) and (5.4).
When passing to the Euclidean signature by Wick’s rotation ∆ t=−i∆τ, the parameter
Tvac≡β−1=/planckover2pi1(∆τ)−1≈/planckover2pi1H (5.5)
acquires the meaning of localvacuum temperature. Here the dimension is restored. An exact ca lculation of the local
vacuum temperature in de Sitter spacetime has been done in [13–16 ]:Tvac=/planckover2pi1H/π. From the method of calculating
the temperature in the cited worksit is evident that the calculation r esult is valid when |˙H|≪H2. The last restriction
takes place in the inﬂation phase. Local temperatures diﬀer from t he horizon temperature in de Sitter space-time
[29], although all the temperatures discussed here are of the same order. As can be seen, simple qualitative reasoning
within the framework of quantum ﬁeld theory leads to a correct est imate of the local vacuum temperature.
Let’s make a remark. The calculation of the local vacuum temperatu re in the paper [13] is tied to the space-time
of a particular geometry: the de Sitter space-time. On the contra ry, our approach to estimating the local vacuum
temperature can be applied to the space-time ofany geometry. We need only relativelylocal homogeneityand isotropy
ofspace. The generalconditions for the existence and measurab ilityof the local vacuum temperature arenot discussed
here.
Here one should cite the classic work of Unruh [30], in which the proble m of calculating the temperature of, for
example, the horizon of a black hole, was connected with the dynamic s of quantized ﬁelds.
Once again, we note that thermodynamic considerations do not app ly to low-frequency degrees of freedom. In
particular, ordinary real matter may, generally speaking, not be in a state of thermal equilibrium.14
It can be seen from the ﬁrst Eq. (4.9) that the constant Λ 0cancels out the huge negative energy of the vacuum,
so that in the era of power-law expansion only the relatively extreme ly small positive energy density of real matter
aﬀects the dynamics. From the given solution of Einstein’s equations , it can be seen that the huge value of pressure
is also mainly reduced by the constant Λ 0. In the presented solution we have ˜ p∼−˜ε∼Λ0. Such a ratio of energy
and pressure is possible only in the general theory of relativity.
Let us introduce the notation ˜ ǫvac≡(˜ε+Λ0). With the help of Eqs. (4.8) and (4.10) we ﬁnd:
˜ǫvac≡(˜ε+Λ0), ǫvac=˜ǫvac
8πG=3H2
8πG. (5.6)
The last relation is contained in [16]. It is the quantity (5.6) that intera cts with the Einstein tensor in the Einstein
equation. According to (5.5) the vacuum temperature T≈/planckover2pi1H. Therefore, the ratio (5.6) is rewritten as follows:
ǫvac=λ3T2
8πG/planckover2pi12, λ∼1. (5.7)
Statement 2 . If we know the energy density as a function of temperature, the n the free energy density is
fvac=−T/integraldisplayT
0ǫvac(T′)
(T′)2dT′. (5.8)
Checking the Statement 2 is reduced to checking the fact that the function (5.8) satisﬁes the following system of
equations:
svac=−(∂/∂T)fvac, fvac=ǫvac−Tsvac. (5.9)
Heresvacis the local vacuum entropy density. In our case (5.7) we obtain:
fvac=−ǫvac=−λ3T2
8πG/planckover2pi12, svac=λ3T
4πG/planckover2pi12. (5.10)
A more accurate calculation for the quantities (5.7) and (5.10) in de S itter space-time is given in [16], which shows
thatλ=π2.
The estimate ˜ p∼=Λ0together with the vacuum energy hypothesis ˜ ε∼=−Λ0justiﬁes the equation of state (4.11). In
both parts of equality (˜ ε+ ˜p) =κ(˜ε+Λ0), the diverging values of the quantities cancel each other out. Th is fact is
the result of solving dynamic equations.
According to Eqs. (4.12) and (5.5) we have:
/planckover2pi1dβ∼d(1/H) = 3/2κdt.
But in the inﬂation phase a(t) =a0eHt, and so dt=H−1da/a. Thus we have:
dβ/β∼(3/2)κda/a. (5.11)
Since the temperature decreases in the inﬂation phase, it can be se en from (5.11) that κ(t0)>0.
VI. CONCLUSSION
In the works [31–34] and [5] the equality
/angbracketleftbig
ea
V1V2/angbracketrightbig
=κ(0)
(V1V2)/angbracketleftbig
Θa
V1V2/angbracketrightbig
(6.1)
was proposed. This equality holds both in the lattice theory of gravit y, identical to the one studied here, and
in the continuous theory. The relation (6.1) is justiﬁed by the fact t hat the values under the average transform
identically under all symmetry transformations, including discrete P T symmetry. The relation (3.13), obtained by
direct calculation in the continuum limit at zero temperature, is anoth er argument in favor of the validity of the
relation (6.1).15
Thus, if the hypothesis proposed above is correct, then at the ma ximum possible temperature, the right side of Eq.
(6.1) vanishes according to (3.12), whence follows
/angbracketleftbig
ea
V1V2/angbracketrightbig
Gauge Fix= 0. (6.2)
This result is obtained directly in the same way as the result (3.12) was obtained. The last equality means that in
the lattice theory of gravity in the high-temperature phase, spac e collapses into a point.
However, in the long-wave limit at low temperature, the energy-mom entum tensor of the Dirac ﬁeld is non-zero
(3.13), the quantized ﬁeld of the tetrad ﬂuctuates weakly and its m ean is not equal to zero.
The above means that in the lattice theory of gravity under study t here is a phase transition in temperature
(possibly more than one). In the high-temperature phase, space is curled up into a point, the average of the energy-
momentum tensor is zero, and the discrete PT symmetry is not brok en. On the contrary, in the low-temperature
phase these quantities are not equal to zero and PT symmetry is br oken. The role of the order parameter is played by
the average∝an}b∇acketle{tea
µ∝an}b∇acket∇i}ht, which becomes non-zero in the low-temperature phase. In the low -temperature phase, the process
of exponential expansion of space begins, transitioning to a power law of expansion. During the phase transition
from the high-temperature to the low-temperature phase, doma ins with opposite mean values ∝an}b∇acketle{tea
µ∝an}b∇acket∇i}htand∝an}b∇acketle{tΘa
µ∝an}b∇acket∇i}htcan be
formed. The domain wall separating such domains was studied in [6]
