The comparison of experimental data and theoretical predictions is important for our understanding of the mechanisms for interactions and
particle production in hadron collisions, both at the Large Hadron Collider and at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider experiments. Several
tools were ideated to help with that. Rivet (Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and Theory) is a framework that facilitates the
comparison between measurements from high-energy physics experiments and Monte Carlo event generators able to produce outputs using
the HepMC package. Rivet contains a repository with analysis algorithms developed by experiments, providing analysis documentation and
preservation.
The recent developments for the implementation of centrality and multiplicity classes in Rivet are presented in this contribution.

1 Introduction
Currently, the data and analysis preservation in high-energy
physics experiments is becoming a common concern. Previ-
ous experiments and collaborations are losing the power of
reproducing their measurements since the data are not prop-
erly kept in a accessible way. The old code, which con-
tains crucial and detailed information like detector accep-
tance, particle and event selections, and corrections, is no
longer maintained and it is very difﬁcult, if possible, to be
run again. Comparisons of previous measurements with new
models is, therefore, very challenging.
Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and The-
ory (Rivet) [1] is a framework that aims to facilitate the com-
parison between data and Monte Carlo (MC) event genera-
tors.
2 Rivet framework
Rivet analyses are written in C++ and it currently contains
more than 1000 analyses from several high-energy physics
collaborations. The data, when available, are downloaded di-
rectly from HepData [2]. Any model that is incorporated in
an event generator able to produce output that complies with
HepMC framework [3] can be used by Rivet for the compar-
ison with data. The integration of Rivet with HepMC and
HepData is pictured in the scheme presented in Fig. 1.
The references for the event generators in Fig. 1 can
be found in [4–12]. Not all of them provide output using
HepMC standards.
In principle, an article presenting a measurement should
present enough information to make the measurement able
to be reproduced by another experiment or theoretician inter-
ested in comparing the data with a model. However, some
subtle details about detector acceptances, particle selections,
trigger conditions, etc, could be missing or not clearly de-
scribed. This can be the case even in internal notes in large
collaborations.
FIGURE 1. Schematic diagram showing how Rivet is integrated
with HepMC and HepData.
Rivet aims at preserving all the analysis details. Further-
more, it should reproduce the methods used in a measurement
as close as possible. One of the pillars of the Rivet philoso-
phy is that we should treat Monte Carlo simulations in the
same way as data.
In order to assure maximum ﬁdelity to the original ac-
ceptances, selections and methods used in a measurement,
whenever possible, the rivet analysis should be implemented
by the collaboration that published the article containing the
measurement. Currently, ALICE has an ofﬁcial internal pro-
cedure for Rivet analysis approvals.
3 Centrality and multiplicity determination
Measurements in heavy-ion collisions are commonly differ-
ential in centrality intervals to study different physical phe-
nomena. Therefore, centrality determination is a crucial fea-
ture Rivet has to provide in order to reproduce measurements
in heavy-ion collisions.
Centrality determination in ALICE is commonly pro-
vided by the V0 detector [13], which consists of two ar-
rays, V0-A and V0-C covering the pseudorapidity ranges 2.8
< < 5.1 and 3.7< < 1.7 respectively.

posited in the V0 scintillators (amplitude). The most cen-
tral collisions are associated with those event with highest
V0 amplitude. The details of the centrality determination are
described in [14].

Distribution (NBD) using parameters from the Glauber model.

sured by ALICE and the charged particle multiplicity in the V0 ac-
ceptance calculated with Rivet from Pb–Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV
events simulated with PYTHIA 8 Angantyr (red line).
The centrality determination in Rivet uses the multiplic-
ity of charged particles in the acceptance of the V0. Since
the multiplicity of particles in heavy-ion collision events in
Monte Carlo event generators is model dependent, it is neces-
sary to create a calibration ﬁle that depends on collisions sys-
tem, energy and event generator. Figure 3 shows the V0 am-
plitude distribution measured by ALICE and the multiplicity
of charged particles in Pb–Pb collisions atpsNN= 2:76TeVgenerated with PYTHIA 8 Angantyr [6].
Rivet divides the charged particle multiplicity presented
in ﬁgure 3 (red line) in centrality percentiles. So the
most central events are associated to the highest multiplic-
ity events. When running the Rivet analysis that requires
centrality determination, this calibration has to be provided.
A similar strategy is used for multiplicity determination in
pp and p–Pb collisions. Currently, ALICE is developing the
possibility to characterize the event using the self-normalized
charged particle multiplicity distribution. This development
is presented in sections 4 and 5.
4 Self-normalized multiplicity
Forward-rapidity multiplicity classes can be deﬁned in
ALICE using the V0 detector. Figure 4 shows the distribution
of the V0M amplitude, which is proportional to the number
of charged particles passing through the V0A and V0C de-
tectors, scaled by its average value hV0M i[15].
FIGURE 4. Distribution of the V0M amplitude scaled by its aver-
age value hV0M iused to determined forward-rapidity multiplicity
classes in pp collisions atps= 13 TeV .
The Silicon Pixel Detector (SPD) [16, 17] is the closest
detector to the interaction point in ALICE. The SPD provides
mid-rapidity multiplicity classes determination using the re-
constructed tracklets, which are track segments that connects
hits in the two SPD layers pointing to the primary vertex. The
self-normalized estimator is obtained with the distribution of
SPD tracklets NSPD tracklets in -2 << 2 scaled by the av-
erage of its value hNSPD tracklets i. The self-normalized SPD
tracklets distribution is presented in Fig. 5.

average value hNSPD tracklets iused to determine midrapidity mul-
tiplicity classes in pp collisions atps= 13 TeV .
The event characterization using self-normalized multi-
plicity estimators in Rivet is under development in ALICE.
Similar to what was discussed in the previous section, instead
of using the V0M amplitude, Rivet uses the charged particle
multiplicity in the V0 acceptance. In particular, the forward-
rapidity self-normalized estimator uses the multiplicity of
charged particles in the V0 acceptance scaled by its average
value. Figure 6 shows the V0M/ hV0M idistribution calcu-
lated with Rivet using pp collisions at 13 TeV generated with
PYTHIA 8 Monash 2013 tune [4, 18].

Similarly to what is done for the V0M, the self-
normalized multiplicity estimator at mid-rapidity uses the
number of charged particles in the acceptance of the SPD.

SPD acceptance scaled by its average value in pp collisions

5 Results using the self-normalized multiplic-
ity estimators
The self-normalized multiplicity estimators framework in
Rivet is currently work in progress and being tested using ar-
ticles published by ALICE that use such estimators. The ﬁrst
measurement used to test the V0M/ hV0M iestimator was the
transverse momentum ( pT) of jets in different multiplicity in-
tervals in pp collisions atps= 13 TeV [19].

The transverse momentum of jets reconstructed with
FastJet anti-kTalgorithm [20] and resolution parameter R=
0.2 in the multiplicity class 0-1% in pp collisions atps=13TeV is presented in ﬁgure 8. The measurement was com-
pared with PYTHIA 8 Monash 2013 using Rivet and the self-
normalized V0M multiplicity framework. The agreement of
the model to data is a positive indication that the framework
can reproduce the multiplicity determination method used by
ALICE. Other multiplicity classes presented a similar perfor-
mance.
The self-normalized estimator using the SPD was also
tested using the measurements in [15]. Figure 9 presents
the charged particle pseudorapidity distribution in pp colli-
sions atps= 5:02TeV . The ALICE data are compared
with PYTHIA 8 Monash 2013 using Rivet and the SPD self-
normalized framework. The results fairly reproduce the com-
parisons to MC presented in the cited article.
6 Summary
Rivet is a valuable tool for analysis preservation and compar-
ison of data to Monte Carlo event generators. The develop-
ment of additional tools to facilitate the implementation of
Rivet analyses is an important contribution to the framework
and can be of beneﬁt both for the experiment and the theory
side. The self-normalized multiplicity estimators are provid-
ing consistent results between MC curves in Rivet and those
provided by experiments. The ﬁnal goal is to make this mul-
tiplicity framework available soon in the Rivet ofﬁcial frame-
work.
