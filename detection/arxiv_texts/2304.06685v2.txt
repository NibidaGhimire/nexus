Abstract: In this work, we resolve conflicting experimental and theoretical findings related to the
dynamical stability and superconducting properties of Fm¯3m-LuH 3, which was recently suggested
as the parent phase harboring room-temperature superconductivity at near-ambient pressures. In-
cluding temperature and quantum anharmonic lattice effects in our calculations, we demonstrate
that the theoretically predicted structural instability of the Fm¯3mphase near ambient pressures
is suppressed for temperatures above 200 K. We provide a p–Tphase diagram for stability up to
pressures of 6 GPa, where the required temperature for stability is reduced to T >80 K. We also de-
termine the superconducting critical temperature TcofFm¯3m-LuH 3within the Migdal-Eliashberg
formalism, using temperature- and quantum-anharmonically-corrected phonon dispersions, finding
that the expected Tcfor electron-phonon mediated superconductivity is in the range of 50 – 60 K,
i.e., well below the temperatures required to stabilize the lattice. When considering moderate dop-
ing based on rigidly shifting the Fermi level, Tcdecreases for both hole and electron doping. Our
results thus provide evidence that any observed room-temperature superconductivity in pure or
doped Fm¯3m-LuH 3, if confirmed, cannot be explained by a conventional electron-phonon mediated
pairing mechanism.
INTRODUCTION
The scientific community’s interest in lutetium hy-
drides has been reignited overnight following Dasenbrock-
Gammon et al.’s recent announcement of a room-
temperature superconductor (RTS) at almost ambient
pressure in the Lu-N-H system [1]. If this result would
be confirmed, it could mark the discovery of a new, rev-
olutionary class of lowest-pressure, highest- Tchydrides,
paving the way for a plethora of technological advance-
ments in fields ranging from medicine to quantum com-
puting [2–9].
Although the proposed RTS phase has been charac-
terized using several different experimental techniques
in Ref. [1], including X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-
dispersive X-ray, and Raman spectroscopy, the structural
details of the red matter superconductor, as named by the
authors due to the bright red color of the samples, re-
mains unknown given the inability of conventional spec-
troscopy methods in measuring defect densities and frac-
tional occupations of light elements such as H or N.
The main phase reported in Ref. [1] to be super-
conducting is suggested to be LuH 3−δNϵwith Fm¯3m
face-centered cubic (fcc) space-group (SG), based on
the obtained diffraction patterns and comparisons with
known lutetium hydrides [10–13]. A minor, non-
superconducting phase B was also identified in all the
obtained samples and assigned to a Fm¯3m-LuH 2struc-
ture [1].
Since the initial report by Dasenbrock-Gammon et
al. [1], several experimental groups have invested signifi-

gaining a better understanding of the proposed supercon-
ducting phase [14–23]. A few theoretical studies have also
been made available [24–29], identifying the most likely
phases that match the experimental data and investigat-
ing the possibility of achieving RTS in the Lu-N-H system
within the electron-phonon (el-ph) coupling mechanism.
Independent crystal structure prediction studies have
demonstrated that both the LuH 2and LuH 3compo-
sitions are thermodynamically stable in the Lu-N-H
ternary phase diagram [24–26, 28]. While these theo-
retical works have confirmed the presence of the Fm¯3m-
LuH 2phase on the convex hull, they have also revealed
that for LuH 3the cubic Fm¯3mphase is not the ther-
modynamically most stable one close to ambient pres-
sure [24–26, 28]. In addition, phonon calculations for
Fm¯3m-LuH 3within the commonly employed harmonic
approximation suggest that this phase is dynamically
highly unstable due to the presence of several imaginary
modes in the vibrational spectra present in the whole
extent of the Brillouin zone (BZ) [24, 25, 29].
The two Fm¯3mphases of LuH 2and LuH 3, even
though the latter is supposedly dynamically unstable,
are of significant importance. On the one hand, re-
cent studies argue that the actual composition observed
in Dasenbrock-Gammon et al.’s work [1] is, in fact, N-
doped or pure fcc LuH 2[14, 16–18, 20]. The differenti-
ation here is quite tricky, as LuH 2and LuH 3share the
same structural framework with H atoms occupying only
tetrahedral sites or tetrahedral + octahedral sites, re-
spectively. Moreover, their crystal cell volumes at am-
bient pressure are also quite similar ( V0
LuH 2= 31.6˚A vs.
V0
LuH 3= 31.3˚A) and they both match the reported XRDarXiv:2304.06685v2  [cond-mat.supr-con]  11 Jan 20242

patterns of Dasenbrock-Gammon et al.’s for the main
phase [24, 25].
On the other hand, it has been predicted recently that
Fm¯3m-LuH 2has a negligibly low Tc[24], while Fm¯3m-
LuH 3is predicted to have finite critical temperatures
smaller than 35 K [24]. It is important to note, however,
that the calculations for the latter have been performed
by neglecting all contributions of the imaginary modes to
the el-ph coupling and, therefore, only serve as a rough
estimate.
To get an accurate description of the physical proper-
ties in these systems, several effects have to be taken
into account: (i) As has been demonstrated for vari-
ous materials, anharmonicity and the quantum motion
of ions, effects that are neglected in harmonic phonon
calculations within the Born-Oppenheimer approxima-
tion, can have significant implications for certain mate-
rials [30–35]. These corrections can become particularly
important for hydrogen-rich compounds [35–40], where
the zero-point motion of H atoms can even modify the
ground state structure, and anharmonic effects may sig-
nificantly change the energy of high-frequency H vibra-
tions. (ii) Given that the experiments for the Lu-N-H
system have been conducted at elevated temperatures
up to room temperature, including temperature effects
may be crucial for an accurate modeling of the system
as well. (iii) Furthermore, doping with N, as suggested
in Dasenbrock-Gammon et al. [1], could also impact the
superconducting properties.
With this work, we want to clarify the conflicting ex-
perimental and theoretical findings related to the stabil-
ity of Fm¯3m-LuH 3and provide an accurate description
of its superconducting properties to understand if RTS at
near-ambient pressure is attainable in this phase. Com-
pellingly, by the inclusion of quantum ionic effects and
anharmonicity within the framework of the stochastic
self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) [41],
we show that the Fm¯3m-LuH 3phase can be stabilizedat temperatures above 200 K for pressures of 1 GPa and
we also provide a p–Tphase diagram for stability up
to 6 GPa. Moreover, by utilizing the Migdal-Eliashberg
formalism [42, 43], we predict a Tcof approx. 50–60 K
at a pressure of 2 .8 GPa, and also probe the effects of
small doping on Tc, providing evidence that any observed
room-temperature superconductivity in pure or moder-
ately doped Fm¯3m-LuH 3, if present at all, cannot be
explained by a conventional el-ph pairing mechanism.
RESULTS
Temperature and quantum anharmonic lattice
effects on stability
As mentioned above, the phonon dispersion of Fm¯3m-
LuH 3(hereafter, we omit the Fm¯3mnotation when refer-
ring to Fm¯3m-LuH 2orFm¯3m-LuH 3) at ambient pres-
sures within the harmonic approximation exhibits sev-
eral imaginary phonon modes throughout the whole BZ,
shown in Fig. 1(a) as dashed black lines. This could ei-
ther indicate a genuine structural instability of the phase
or an inadequate theoretical description of the physi-
cal system. To resolve this issue, we have calculated
the vibrational properties incorporating quantum ionic,
anharmonic, and temperature effects on the same foot-
ing, as implemented in SSCHA [41]. The self-consistent
harmonic approximation method effectively maps the
full anharmonic and interacting lattice onto an auxil-
iary harmonic system. The actual system’s ground state
is then obtained by minimizing the free energy of the
auxiliary harmonic system [44–47]. This minimization
is performed stochastically via Monte Carlo summation
and sampling over several consecutive ensembles arbitrar-
ily populated by many structures. Within the density-
functional theory (DFT) framework, each structure de-
notes a supercell with displaced atomic positions, where3

the supercell dimension determines the density of phonon
wave vectors in the BZ [37]. Further information is avail-
able in the Method section, Supplementary Method 1,
and Refs. [32, 36, 39, 41, 48–50].
Noteworthy, the potential energy surface changes upon
including quantum anharmonic lattice effects. For the
high-symmetry LuH 3, the only structural degree of free-
dom is the lattice constant (synonymously, the unit cell
volume), as all other structural parameters are fixed by
symmetry. Effectively, this means that, for a given value
of the lattice constant, one can define an associated pres-
sure within DFT ( pDFT) and within SSCHA ( p), the lat-
ter also depending on the temperature. The fact that pis,
in general, larger than pDFT, can be readily understood
by considering the effects of zero-point motion [35].
To obtain a p–Tphase diagram, we performed several
scans as a function of pandT, described in the follow-
ing: By performing a SSCHA calculation for a= 5.040˚A
andT= 0 K to compare with the harmonic calculation,
one finds a pressure of p= 2.1 GPa, i.e., very close to
the synthesis pressure reported by Dasenbrock-Gammon
et al. [1], and the stabilization of almost all imaginary
phonon modes; except for two degenerate modes around
theXand the Khigh-symmetry points, as indicated by
the solid blue lines in Fig. 1. This implies that the imag-
inary phonon frequencies at these points in the BZ are,
in fact, genuine structural instabilities.

The star marks the p–Tset for the ME calculation discussed
in the main text. The corresponding dispersions are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 3.
Increasing the temperature, that instability is sup-
pressed for T >150 K (cf. Fig. 1) and pincreases slightly
(cf. Tab. I). We also observe that the optical phonon
modes for energies above ℏω >70 meV are barely affected
by temperature effects. The same applies to the acoustic
modes, except for regions near the instabilities around X
andK. The optical modes around 40 – 50 meV harden
slightly with increasing temperature. To investigate how
changes in the lattice constant – or, in other words, the
pressure – affect the phonon dispersions, we kept the tem-
perature fixed at T= 150 K and performed SSCHA cal-
culations for four different values of a. The results can be
appreciated in Fig. 2, which shows the acoustic phonon
branches in the low-energy region of the dispersion (for
the entire dispersions as a function of pressure, we re-
fer the reader to Supplementary Fig. 2 in Supplementary
Discussion 1). As expected, the phonon energies increase
with increasing pressure, and the instability is entirely
absent for p= 4.4 GPa at 150 K.
To determine more accurately at which temperature
LuH 3becomes stable as a function of pressure, we have
performed further SSCHA calculations, whose results we
summarize in Tab. I. There, DFT pressures pDFT and
pressures pat temperatures of 0, 150, and 300 K for five
different values of the lattice constant aare reproduced.
In addition, we present in Fig. 3 a p–Tphase diagram
by cubic interpolation of the energy of the lowest phonon
mode at K, indicated by circle markers, as a function
ofpandT. In the following, we base our predictions
about stability on the interpolated contour lines shown
in Fig. 3, if not stated otherwise.

tary Discussion 2, and Supplementary Fig. 6, 7, 8, and
14 [51, 52]. We note in passing that the calculations in
higher supercells do not unambiguously answer the ques-
tion of dynamic (in)stability in a specific region in the BZ
in a certain pressure range. Hence, we consider the p–T
conditions of dynamical stability in the 2 ×2×2 supercells
as a lower limit.
Our results highlight that although quantum anhar-
monic lattice effects strongly influence the phonon prop-
erties, finite temperatures are imperative to stabilize the
fcc LuH 3phase. In fact, we find that temperatures of
80 K or higher are required to suppress the structural
instability for pressures up to 6 GPa (cf. Fig. 3). As
an aside, we want to note that during the revision pro-
cess, we became aware of another work examining the
stability of the Fm¯3mphase of LuH 3within the SSCHA
formalism [53]. We want to mention at this point that
we did similar calculations for LuH 2, which is dynami-
cally stable already at the harmonic level, and find that
temperature and quantum anharmonic lattice effects on
phonon energies are much smaller there and subordinate
(more details are provided in Supplementary Fig. 13).
Superconductivity
Having demonstrated that LuH 3can become dynami-
cally stable with the inclusion of temperature and quan-
tum anharmonic lattice effects, we move on to obtain a
detailed picture of the superconducting state, assuming
the pairing is mediated by el-ph interactions. To do so,
we first have to discuss its electronic properties. Un-
less otherwise expressed explicitly, all calculations from
now on are based on the Fm¯3m-LuH 3structure with
a= 5.040˚A (corresponding to a pressure pof 2.8 GPa
at room temperature). Additional cases are reported in
Supplementary Table 2.Figure 4(a) shows the electronic dispersions and (par-
tial) DOS around the Fermi level, which is the energy
region relevant for SC pairing within the conventional
el-ph mechanism (a more zoomed-out version of this
plot is provided in Supplementary Fig. 9). LuH 3is a
metal with three very dispersive bands crossing the Fermi
level, mainly of Lu- dorbital character with only little hy-
bridization to H- sstates. Consequently, the Fermi sur-
face has three small pockets: one Γ-centered hole pocket,
where a small amount of H- shybridization with Lu- dis
observed; and two nested electron pockets around Lof
purely Lu- dcharacter. This can also be appreciated in
Fig. 4(b), where we plot the Fermi surface colored accord-
ing to the respective H- sorbital contributions. In addi-
tion, the DOS increases steeply around the Fermi level
with increasing energy, with Lu- dbands above and hy-
bridized Lu-H bands below the Fermi energy. It’s worth
mentioning that almost 70 % of the H- sstates of the hole
pocket around Γ originate from H located at the octahe-
dral sites, which are unoccupied in LuH 2, explaining to
some extent the difference in superconducting behavior.
These findings have several implications: As for exam-
ple discussed in Ref. [24] for the Lu-N-H system (or in
general in Refs. [4–9]), high- TcSC requires that electrons
of H-bonds participate in the el-ph pairing to harness the
high phonon energies of the H vibrations. Having mainly
Lu-dstates at the Fermi level is thus quite detrimen-
tal to RTS. Furthermore, the low density of electrons at
the Fermi level is also disadvantageous for achieving the
highest- Tc’s [4–9]. On a more technical note, the minute
sizes of the Fermi surface pockets also mean that con-
verging any calculation for el-ph interactions and SC is
particularly challenging, as the BZ integrals that have
to be evaluated require very dense kandqwave vector
grids.
To determine the superconducting properties of LuH 3,
we employed the Migdal-Eliashberg formalism [42] as im-5

plemented in the EPW code [43], which allows the in-
terpolation of the electronic and vibrational properties
onto very dense grids in reciprocal space using Wannier
interpolation. The calculations are performed using the
SSCHA-renormalized dynamical matrices at T= 300 K,
the temperature closest to where Dasenbrock-Gammon
et al. [1] report the transition, and choosing a stan-
dard value of µ∗= 0.1 for the Morel-Anderson Coulomb
pseudopotential [54]. (Using the corrected anharmonic
dynamical matrices is justified as the ions, due to the
Fm¯3msymmetry, are fixed to the same high-symmetry
sites within DFPT and SSCHA.) With this setup, we
want to determine at which temperature LuH 3becomes
superconducting, i.e., at which temperature the super-
conducting gap ∆ opens.
Fig. 5 summarizes the results of our calculations.
Within the isotropic ME formalism, we obtain a TIME
cof
about 53 K. When solving the fully anisotropic ME equa-
tions, the superconducting critical temperature increases
to about TAME
c = 60 K (see Supplementary Fig. 11). The
inset of Fig. 5(a) shows the Fermi surface coloured ac-
cording to the values of the anisotropic superconducting
gap function ∆ kat a temperature T= 10 K, demonstrat-
ing a rather isotropic distribution of gap values.
To elucidate better the origin of el-ph coupling, we
present in Fig. 5(b) the wave-vector ( q) and mode ( ν) re-
solved el-ph coupling strength λq,ν, plotted as fat bands
onto the phonon dispersion. This shows clearly that al-
most all of the contributions to the el-ph coupling origi-
nate from the lowest two optical phonon modes and, to
a lesser extent, from the lower acoustic branch, around
L. This corresponds to the coupling of electrons between
the Γ-centered hole pocket and the electron pockets at L,
i.e., to a phonon wave vector of q= (0.5,−0.5,0.5)·2π/a
(cf. Fig. 4 and inset of Fig. 5). The respective contri-
butions of the phonon modes to the total coupling canalso be appreciated from the provided Eliashberg spectral
function α2F(ω) in Fig. 5, which has most of its weight
between 40 – 60 meV. According to our calculations, the
total el-ph coupling strength λis about 1.7.
At this point, we want to highlight an important con-
sequence of our results: Despite the quite sizeable Tc’s
in the range of 50 – 60 K, fcc LuH 3will not show SC in
experiments near ambient pressures, as its critical tem-
perature for stability is larger than 80 K in this pressure
regime (cf. Fig. 3).
In the report of room-temperature SC at near-ambient
pressures by Dasenbrock-Gammon et al. [1], the authors
mention that LuH 3could be doped with small amounts
of N. To estimate the effects of changing the number of
electrons on Tcand to see whether room-temperature SC
is attainable in the LuH 3phase with such a doping, we
performed additional ME calculations within the rigid-
band approximation.
The energy shifts ∆ Etaken into consideration are in-
dicated in Fig. 4 as dashed horizontal lines: For ∆ E=
−0.2 eV, which corresponds to a change in electron num-
bers by -0.03, we find a decrease of Tcto about 30 K,
which is because the DOS available for pairing is rel-
atively low in this region. This Tcvalue refers to the
isotropic calculation. In the anisotropic case, the conver-
gence of the ME equations fails due to the low density
of states at the Fermi energy, where an extremely dense
k-grid is needed to generate explicit points at the Fermi
energy. Interestingly, for positive shifts of 0.2 and 0 .4 eV
(corresponding to adding 0.12 and 0.33 electrons, respec-
tively), we also observe a decrease in Tcto less than 30
and 45 K, respectively. Although the DOS strongly in-
creases for energies above the Fermi level, the H con-
tributions, in fact, decrease (cf. Fig. 4). As these are
crucial to SC in LuH 3, the critical temperatures conse-
quently also decrease. More details for these calculations6
are provided in Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplemen-
tary Tab. 2. We extend our SC analysis to pressures and
phononic temperatures covered in the phase diagram in
Fig. 3 and find only minor changes in Tc. The results are
provided in Supplementary Tab. 2.
Despite the rigid-band approximation providing only
a rough estimate for the dependence of Tcwith doping,
it should be accurate enough for small doping levels. A
more realistic but computationally demanding approach
would be to incorporate N atoms into the LuH 3struc-
ture, which requires dealing with large supercells. Nev-
ertheless, the very fact that Tcdecreases for shifts of the
Fermi level in both doping directions strongly indicates
that optimizing the electron count will not be able to
turn LuH 3into a room-temperature superconductor at
near-ambient pressures.
DISCUSSION
To summarize, our results demonstrate that even with
employing quantum anharmonic corrections as imple-
mented in SSCHA, the proposed Fm¯3m-LuH 3is dy-
namically unstable for pressures below 6 GPa at T=
0 K. With the additional incorporation of tempera-
ture effects, however, this phase can be stabilized for
T > 200 K at p= 0 GPa ( T > 80 K at p= 6 GPa).
While this means that Dasenbrock-Gammon et al. [1]
could indeed have synthesized the Fm¯3m-LuH 3phase
near room-temperature, our calculations for the su-
perconducting properties within the fully anisotropic
Migdal-Eliashberg theory, including temperature- and
quantum-anharmonic-corrected phonon dispersions, un-
ambiguously demonstrate that the expected Tcfor an
el-ph mediated SC pairing (50–60 K) is well below the
reported room-temperature one; in fact, it is smaller
than the critical temperature of stability in these pressure
ranges, and thus Fm¯3m-LuH 3would decompose or tran-
sition into a different structure before it has the chance
to become a (conventional) superconductor.
METHODS
DF(P)T calculations
The electronic and harmonic phonon properties are
calculated within density-functional (perturbation) the-
ory using the plane-wave pseudopotential code Quantum
Espresso [55]. We used the PBE-GGA parametrization
for the exchange-correlation functional [56] in combina-
tion with scalar-relativistic optimized norm-conserving
Vanderbilt pseudopotentials (ONCV) [57, 58], including
one valence electron for hydrogen and 25 valence elec-
trons for Lutetium. We investigated the influence of em-
ploying different types of pseudopotentials [59] for our re-
sults, which can be found in Supplementary Discussion 2,
Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Fig. 4 and5. The employed Lu pseudopotential treats the 4 fstates
explicitly and places them well below the Fermi energy in
LuH 3, which is in excellent agreement with other works
on explicit Lu-H-N structures [25, 27, 60, 61]. We further
confirm the 4 fenergy range by an all-electron calcula-
tion using Wien2k [62]. Upon including on-site Coulomb
interactions within DF(P)T+ Ucalculations, we find no
contribution of the Lu- fstates on the electronic struc-
ture around the Fermi energy, and no noticeable influence
on the harmonic phonon dispersions, (cf. Supplementary
Fig. 15 and 16).
We performed extensive convergence tests on the nu-
merical parameters and achieve an accuracy of below
1 meV /atom for the total energy with a 12 ×12×12k-
grid, plane-wave cutoff energy of 100 Ry, and a smear-
ing value for the Brillouin zone integration of 0 .005 Ry.
The unit cell (uc) calculations were carried out in the
fcc primitive unit cell with 4 atoms (lutetium in Wyck-
off site 4 a, hydrogen in 4 band 8 c) employing a conver-
gence threshold of 10−10Ry for the total energy in all
electronic self-consistency calculations. For the structure
relaxations, we used a convergence threshold of 10−7Ry
in total energy; all force components are zero by symme-
try. For the DFT calculations in 2 ×2×2 supercells, the
k-grid was reduced to 6 ×6×6 according to the larger cell
dimensions. The harmonic dynamical matrices and the
self-consistent first-order variation of the potential are
calculated within DFPT on a 6 ×6×6q-grid employing a
phonon self-convergency threshold of 10−16.
SSCHA calculations
The SSCHA calculations are performed in the
constant-volume mode without relaxation, as imple-
mented in the SSCHA python package [41]. As all atomic
positions are fixed by symmetry, the structure does not
change in the SSCHA minimization procedure. We per-
formed separate SSCHA calculations in 2 ×2×2 super-
cells for all 12 considered p–Tcombinations. The phys-
ical quantities converge within a few hundred random
structures, and to further reduce the stochastic noise, we
increase the number of random structures in the last en-
semble to 1000. The total energies, forces, and stress
tensors for the individual displaced structures are ob-
tained from DFT calculations, as described in the cor-
responding methods section. The SSCHA minimization
is stopped for Kong-Liu ratios below 0.3 and when the
ratio between the free energy gradient with respect to
the auxiliary dynamical matrix and its stochastic error
becomes smaller than 10−7. With these settings, the
free energy differences between the last two ensembles for
eachp–Tcase are well below 1 meV /u c , and the pressure
differences below 0 .1 GPa. The temperature-dependent
anharmonic phonon dispersions are calculated from the
positional free-energy Hessians in the bubble approxima-
tion, i.e., without the fourth-order corrections. As shown
in Supplementary Fig. 1 in Supplementary Method 1,7
the fourth-order corrections are negligible in LuH 3. The
largest differences in anharmonic phonon dispersions be-
tween the last two ensembles are in the order of 1 meV.
The colour profile and contour lines in Fig. 3 are based
on a cubic spline interpolation of the p−Tdata points
in Tab. I to a p×T-grid of size 150 ×150. The final
positional free energy Hessian matrices are interpolated
to a 6 ×6×6q-grid and used as dynamical matrices for
the Migdal-Eliashberg calculations. We want to stress
at this point again that all data presented in the main
text have been obtained using 2 ×2×2 supercells and the
ONCV-PBE settings described above. Further details
and higher supercell calculations are provided in Supple-
mentary Method 1 and in Supplementary Discussion 2.
Migdal-Eliashberg calculations
We employed the Epw code package [42, 43] for the
Wannier interpolation of the el-ph matrix elements onto
dense k- and q-grids and the subsequent self-consistent
solution of the isotropic and the fully anisotropic Migdal-
Eliashberg equations. In particular, we used coarse
6×6×6k- and qgrids and interpolated onto fine
30×30×30 reciprocal grids (see Supplementary Fig. 10),
set a Matsubara frequency cutoff of 1 eV, included elec-
tronic states within ±1 eV around the Fermi energy, and
chose a standard value for the Morel-Anderson pseu-
dopotential of µ∗= 0.10. The starting projections
for the Wannierization were chosen using the SCDM
method [63, 64] for electronic states in the range of
−15 eV to +5 eV around the Fermi energy. The rigid
band shift is achieved within Epw by setting explicitly
the Fermi energy to different values and hence changing
the included electronic band manifold.
