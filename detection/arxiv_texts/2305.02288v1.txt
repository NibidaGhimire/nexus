Abstract —This paper investigated the distributed leader fol-
lower formation control problem for multiple differentially driven
mobile robots. A distributed estimator is ﬁrst introduced and it
only requires the state information from each follower itself and
its neighbors. Then, we propose a bioinspired neural dynamic
based backstepping and sliding mode control hybrid formation
control method with proof of its stability. The proposed control
strategy resolves the impractical speed jump issue that exists in
the conventional backstepping design. Additionally, considering
the system and measurement noises, the proposed control strategy
not only removes the chattering issue existing in the conventional
sliding mode control but also provides smooth control input with
extra robustness. After that, an adaptive sliding innovation ﬁlter
is integrated with the proposed control to provide accurate state
estimates that are robust to modeling uncertainties. Finally, we
performed multiple simulations to demonstrate the efﬁciency and
effectiveness of the proposed formation control strategy.

I. I NTRODUCTION
THE mobile robots have been widely used in many areas
with the advancement of vehicular technologies. The
cooperation among multiple mobile robots has vast appli-
cations such as target search, environment surveillance, and
transportation [1], [2]. Compared with single mobile robots,
a multiple mobile robot system gives extra fault tolerance,
extra ﬂexibility, and completing tasks more efﬁciently [3]–
[5]. Among all the applications of the multiple robot systems,
formation control is one of the most fundamental and critical
research areas. The objective of the robot’s formation control
is to make each robot achieve the velocity required for the
multiple robot system to maintain the prescribed formation
pattern.
There has been extensive research on the formation con-
trol of multiple mobile robots [6]–[9]; the commonly used
coordination strategies include the virtual structure methods,
the behavior based approaches, and the leader-following based

have attracted increasing attention due to their nice properties
(e.g., easy to implement and analyze, good ﬂexibility, etc.) [6],
[9]–[11]. However, notice that in their works it is assumed that
all followers can access the information of the leader’s state,
whereas most of the time accurate leader’s state information
could be challenging and complicated to obtain. Realistic fac-
tors such as communication bandwidth, the operating distance
among the robots, and the total number of robots in the
system can impact followers’ ability to obtain the accurate
leader’s information. Therefore, it would be more practical to
suppose only that a subset of mobile robots in the team can
directly access the leader’s state. To this end, it is necessary
to investigate distributed estimation strategies for each robot
in order to obtain the leaders’ information. Several results
can be found. Yu et al. [12] proposed a distributed formation
control strategy for vehicles of the unicycle type subject to
velocity constraints. After that, there is another research group
proposed a distributed estimator to estimate the leader’s state
for each follower [10]. Another paper proposed a ﬁxed time
leader following consensus for multiple mobile robots [13], in
which the followers estimate the leader’s state in a ﬁxed time.
Another group designed a distributed estimator to estimate the
leader’s state, which was later used to design the distributed
kinematic controller that resolves the speed jump issue [9].
In addition to the leader’s state estimation, the formation
tracking control of multiple mobile robots is also a critical
dimension that needs to be considered, especially under system
and measurement noises. Roughly speaking, the formation
tracking control strategies could be classiﬁed into the follow-
ing ﬁve categories: 1) feedback linearization [14], 2) fuzzy
logic and neural network control [15], [16], 3) Optimal and
model predictive control [17], [18], 4) backstepping control
[9], [19] and 5) sliding mode control [20], [21]. The feedback
linearization method is easy to design and has been well
developed. However, when initial tracking errors occur, this
approach suffers from the speed jump problem that is imprac-
tical [22]. Besides, this method also produces large discontinu-
ities in control commands if there is noise that occur. Neural
networks and fuzzy logic control can deal with the speed
jump issue and provide smooth control input. Nevertheless,
these approaches require online learning or human knowledge,
which are computationally expensive to implement [15], [23].
Model predictive control is one of the popular approaches,
which is able to optimize the online performance index andarXiv:2305.02288v1  [cs.RO]  3 May 20232
handle constraints. Although the predictive control methods
can be used to theoretically achieve the expected performance,
its results may not be guaranteed in practical cases [17]. The
main reason is that the ubiquitous disturbances and noise
in real life will affect the results, but they were neglected
in most of the literature in order to reduce computational
efforts. Backstepping control is relatively easy to design and
has been widely used in multiple mobile robot control [6];
however, this method also suffers from speed jump issues
when initial tracking errors occur. Yang et al . [24] proposed
a bioinspired neural dynamics based backstepping method
that handles speed jump problems, making this method more
practical in real-world applications. Following Yang’s work
[24], another group developed a formation tracking control
algorithm for multiple mobile robots using bioinspired back-
stepping control to prevent speed jumps [9]. The sliding mode
control methods are robust to disturbances, but knowingly
suffer from a chattering issue [21]. In particular, the chattering
and discontinuity phenomena in the control process get even
worse under noises, thus making these methods undesirable in
real-world applications.
In view of the noises, it becomes vital to have an efﬁcient
ﬁlter to provide accurate state estimates. Kalman ﬁlter (KF)
and its variations have been undoubtedly regarded as the most
effective techniques to estimate the states of the robots [25],
[26]. However, while these ﬁlters are proposed to give accurate
state estimates under noises, they still lack the robustness when
the modeling errors and uncertainties are present. Recently,
an adaptive sliding innovation ﬁlter (ASIF) [27] was newly
developed in order to increase the accuracy yet maintain
robustness with respect to modeling errors.
While a good amount of research efforts has been made in
order to obtain practical and efﬁcient distributed solutions for
the multiple mobile robots formation tracking, there still are
some aspects not properly addressed. For example, researchers
in [9], although employed a distributed state estimator in their
design, only dealt with formation control at the kinematic level
without consideration of disturbances and noises, which results
in a restrictive design. As for the dynamic level, most of the
conventional control methods, as mentioned above, suffer from
drawbacks, including impractical speed jump, chattering, and
sensitivity to noise [6], [21], [22]. In view of these technical
challenges, this paper presents a novel distributed formation
tracking control approach for multiple mobile robots so that
the aforementioned issues are addressed signiﬁcantly. The
main contributions of this research are summarized as follows:
1. The distributed formation control problem of differen-
tially driven mobile robots subject to communication limi-
tations, disturbances, and noises is studied, in which only
a subset of followers has the leader’s state information. A
novel distributed leader-following formation control strategy
is developed aided with bioinspired neural dynamics.
2. Considering the communication limitations, a distributed
estimator is developed for each robot to estimate the leader’s
posture information, and the leader’s velocities are then es-
timated by the sliding mode approach without requiring the
leader’s acceleration information.
3. A novel hybrid bioinspired backstepping and slidingmode formation control strategy is proposed to deal with the
speed jump issue in the conventional backstepping design
and generate smooth torque control inputs free from chat-
tering while robustness is maintained. More importantly, the
bioinspired sliding mode control approach can provide smooth
control activities even under the effects of the system and
measurement noises. The overall stability is also proved.
4. The adaptive sliding innovation ﬁlter is integrated with
the proposed distributed hybrid formation control method,
aiming to provide accurate state estimates for each mobile
robot even when modeling errors occur.
This paper is organized as follows; Section II provides pre-
liminaries and formulates problems. Then, Section III designs
the formation control method aided by the bioinspired neural
dynamics. The ASIF is integrated with the proposed approach
to provide accurate state estimates. After that, Section IV
shows multiple simulation comparative results that to show the
advantages of the proposed formation control strategy. Finally,
Section V gives the conclusion and possible future works.

A. Algebraic Graph Theory
The graph theory is capable of modeling the communica-
tions among mobile robots. Consider a network that consists
ofnfollowers; the digraph is deﬁned as G=fV;Egwith a
node setV=f1;2;:::;ngand an edge set EVV. A
directed edge (i;j)2Erefers to the access from node ito
nodej. Then, the adjacency matrix is deﬁned A= [aij]nn.
IfAis a symmetric matrix, then the graph is undirected. The
elements in Aare deﬁned as follows aij= 1 ifi;j2Eand
aij= 0 otherwise. Furthermore, aiiis assumed to be 0. The
Laplacian matrix L= [lij]nn, which is incorporated with A
is deﬁned as
lij=8

i=1;i6=jaiji=j(1)
In this study, the leader mobile robot is labeled as 0and
the followers are indexed by 1ton. Deﬁne the commu-
nications between the followers and the leader as a=a10a20::: an0T. If there is a communication con-
nection between the leader and follower jthenaj0= 1, else
aj0= 0. Then, we deﬁne H2Rnnas

In this paper, we the introduce following assumption and
lemma based on previous studies [9], [10].
Assumption 1. The undirected graph, denoted as G=
(V;E;A ), illustrates the communications among nfollowers.
Gis connected if there is at least one element in ais1, i.e.,
aj0= 1.

B. Problem Formulation
Consider a group of differentially driven mobile robots, the
kinematics is described as
_xi=icosi_yi=isini_i=!i (3)
wherexiandyiare coordinates and iis the orientation of
i-th robot with respect to the inertial frame; iand!iare,
respectively, the linear and angular velocity of i-th robot in
body ﬁxed frames. After the kinematics of the mobile robot
is provided, the dynamics of the mobile robot is then given as
[28]
M(Pi)_i=B(Pi)i C(Pi;_Pi)i+d;i: (4)
wherei= [i;!i]T;M(Pi)is the inertial matrix; B(Pi)
is the transformation matrix; C(Pi;_Pi)is the centrifugal
and Coriolis matrix of the i-th mobile robot; d;i=
d1;id2;iTis the disturbances.
Assumption 2. The disturbances are assumed to be bounded
such that
max
t0jd1;i(t)j 1;iand max
t0jd2;i(t)j 2;i (5)
where 1;iand 2;iare positive constants. Then, the leader
generates a reference signal that guides all the robots, the
leader robot kinematics is given by
_xr=rcosr_yr=rsinr_r=!r: (6)
Assumption 3. Denote the virtual leader’s linear and angular
velocities as rand!r, and assume they are bounded. Ad-
ditionally, assume that _rand_!rare also bounded and there
exist constants 1and2such that
max
t0j_r(t)j1;max
t0j_!r(t)j2: (7)
The leader follower formation control of mobile robot allows
followers to follow the leader in a relative position, such
that the distance between the leader and the i-th follower
is described asxiyi
, where xiandyiare
respectively the desired distance from the i-th follower to the
leader. In addition, the orientation of the followers shares a
pattern similar to that of the leader.
In addition, the system and measurement noises have signif-
icant impacts on the control performance, and these noises are
usually treated as Gaussian distributed with zero mean such
that(Pi(i;k)N (0;Qi;k)), and (Pi(i;k)N (0;Ri;k)),
wherei;kandi;kare the system and measurement noises
at time step k, respectively. Parameters Qi;kandRi;kare
respectively the system and measurement noise covariance,
which are usually determined by the experiments and trials.
Therefore, the objective of this manuscript is to develop
a distributed formation control strategy that achieves global
bounded stability with smooth control inputs, such that

This section designs a novel leader and follower based
formation control with the adaptive sliding innovation ﬁlter.
The distributed estimator is ﬁrst introduced. Then, based on the
error dynamics, the bioinspired kinematic control is proposed
using the backstepping approach to resolve impractical speed
jump issues in the conventional design; after that, a sliding
mode dynamic controller aided by the bioinspired neural
dynamics is developed, which is free from chattering and
provides smooth control input even under noises. The adaptive
sliding innovation ﬁlter is then integrated with the proposed
control strategy not only to provide accurate state estimate but
also robust to faulty working conditions when modeling errors
occur during state estimation processes.
A. Distributed Estimator Design
The conventional design of the leader-follower formation
control of multiple mobile robots makes the assumption that
all followers have access to the leader’s information. However,
this conventional design faces difﬁculty when the communi-
cations among the followers are limited to local, therefore,
not all followers are able to obtain the leader’s state. Thus,
this subsection develops a distributed estimator for every
follower to estimate the leader’s posture and velocities, which
only requires access to neighborhood posture and velocities
information.
First, the posture estimation error for robot iis deﬁned as
eip=ai0(Pir Pr) +nX
j=1aij(Pir Pjr) (11)
whereeipis the neighborhood errors of the i-th robot,
Pr=xryrrTis the leader’s posture; and Pir=xiryirirTis the estimations of the leader posture
from follower iin the inertial frame. Then, the estimation
strategy based on eipis presented as
_Pir=1
i 
 kieip+nX
j=1aij_Pjr+ai0_Pr!
(12)
wherei=Pn
j=1aij+ai0, andkiis a33symmetric positive
deﬁnite matrix. In Assumption 3, _ris only assumed to be
bounded, then the same approach that is given in (11) and (12)
to estimateris not practical. Thus, to estimate the leader’s
velocities, a sliding mode approach has been developed. In
(12), the estimation of _Pirrequires the information from _Pjr,
which is obtained using the information from the velocity
estimators that will be designed in the following part.
First, the linear velocity estimation error for robot iis
deﬁned as
ei=a0(ir r) +nX
j=1aij(ir jr) (13)
whereirandjrare respectively the estimation of leader’s
linear velocity from follower iandj. Based on the estimation
error deﬁned in (13), the estimation law for iris then
provided as
_ir= ka1ei kb1sat (ei) (14)
where positive constants ka1andkb1are both control param-
eters andkb11. Using the same processes, deﬁne !irand4
!jrare respectively the estimation of leader’s angular velocity
from follower iandj, the estimation law for the angular
velocity is given as
_!ir= ka2ei! kb2sat (ei!) (15)
Theorem 1 If Assumption 1 holds, then Pir,ir, and!irre-
spectively converge to Pr,rand!rexponentially considering
the estimation law (12), (14), and (15).
Proof In order to prove Theorem 1, consider the following
Lyapunov candidate function1
2eT
ipeip. The derivative of the
proposed Lyapunov candidate function is calculated as

i_Pir nX
j=1aij_Pjr ai0_Pr!
= eT
ipkieip(16)
Sincekiis symmetric positive deﬁnite, one can conclude
thateipconverges to zero. Additionally, deﬁne ep=eT
1peT
2p::: eT
npTandeq=eT
1qeT
2q::: eT
nqT,
whereeiqis deﬁned as eiq=Pir Pr, then it is found that
ep= (H
I3)eq (17)
Based on (2), His a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix if
Assumption 1 and Lemma 1 hold. Thus, as epexponentially
converges to zero, eqalso converges to zero.
Deﬁne ^i=ir r, based on the estimation law deﬁned
in (14), it is found that
_^i= ka1ei kb1sat (ei) _r (18)
Then, deﬁne e=e1e2::: enTand ^=^1^2:::^nT. It is obtained that
e=H^ (19)
Then, based on (18) and (19), it is easy to verify that
_^= ka1e kb1sat (e) _r1n (20)
Similarly, deﬁne ^!i=!ir !r. Based on (15), the estimation
law for the angular velocity can be rewritten as
_^!= ka2e! kb2sat (e!) _!r1n (21)
wheree!=e1!e2!::: en!Tand ^! =^!1^!2:::^!nT. Once again, it is easy to ﬁnd that
e!=H^!. In order to prove the stability, the Lyapunov
candidate function is proposed as V1=1
2^TH^, and its time
derivative is calculated as
_V1= ^TH( ka1e kb1sat (e) _r1n)
= ka1^THH^ kb1(H^)Tsat (H^) ^TH_r1n(22)
Ifsat(e)is saturated, which means the elements in H^1,
then (22) satisﬁes
_V1 ka1^THH^ (kb1 1)kH^k1 (23)
wherekH^k1is the ﬁrst norm of vector H^. we use the fact
thatkb11andHis a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix to
arrive at the conclusion that the estimation law for the linear
velocity is asymptotically stable.
Lemma 2. Based on Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the following
inequality holds.kH^k1pnkH^k (24)
If the elements in H^ < 1, by applying Lemma 2, (22) is
calculated as
_V1 (ka1+kb1)kH^k2+1pnkH^k
= (ka1+kb1 1)kH^k2wheneverkH^k1(25)
where1is an arbitrary number within the interval (0;ka1+
kb1)and1= (1pn)=1. Thus, the linear velocity estimation
strategy is input-to-state stable with respect to input jj_rjj. In
particular, if t!1 andk_rk! 0, the estimation error ^
exponentially converges to zero.
The Lyapunov candidate function for the angular estimation
law is proposed as V2=1
2^!TH^!, by applying Assumption 1
and Lemma 2, following the same processes from (22) to (25).
It is found that ifjjH^jj1, the angular velocity estimation
strategy is asymptotically stable, if jjH^jj<1,_V2yields
_V2 (ka2+kb2)kH^k2+2pnkH^k
= (ka2+kb2 2)kH^k2wheneverkH^k2(26)
where2is an arbitrary number within the interval (0;ka2+
kb2)and2= (2pn)=2. Therefore, the estimation law for
the angular velocity is input-to-state stable with respect to _!r.
In addition, if t!1 andk_!rk! 0, the estimation error ^!
exponentially converges to zero asymptotically. The proof of
Theorem 1 is ﬁnished.
B. Bioinspired Backstepping Controller Design
The distributed bioinspired backstepping kinematic con-
troller is designed in this subsection to achieve formation
control objectives using the estimated state of the leader. In
addition, the leader’s state information is only available to a
subset of followers. The tracking error of follower iin the
inertial frame is deﬁned as
eix=xi xir xi
eiy=yi yir yi
ei=i ir(27)
where xiandyiare respectively the distances between the
i-th follower and the leader in xandydirections. It is obvious
thatxir,yir, andirexponentially converge to xr,yr, andr,
respectively. Then, the tracking error between the body ﬁxed
frame and the inertial frame is calculated as

iy= (irsinir _yir) cosi (ircosir _xir) sini:(30)5
The conventional backstepping control suffers from speed
jump issue, In order to resolve this problem the bioinspired
neural dynamics is integrated with backstepping control to
avoid the velocity jump issue. The bioinspired neural dynam-
ics was initially proposed in the 1950s [29] for a nervous
system in a membrane model, which was further developed
by Grossberg [30] to describe an adaptive dynamic behavior
of individuals. Researchers have applied this model in different
ﬁelds, which include robotics [9], [24].
The shunting model that is originally derived from Gross-
berg’s neural dynamics model is provided as
_Vsi= AiVsi+ (Bi Vsi)f(^xi) (Di+Vs1)g(^xi)(31)
wheref(^xi) = max (^xi;0)andg(^xi) = max (0; ^xi);Vs1is
the output of the shunting model; Aiis the passive decay rate;
BiandDiare respectively the upper and lower bounds of the
output. We use this shunting model to replace the error term
^xi. Then, the bioinspired backstepping control is proposed as
ci=C1Vsi+ircos^i (32)
!ci=!ir+C2ir^yi+C3irsin^i (33)
whereC1,C2, andC3are positive design parameters.
Remark 1. The initial speed jump issue in the conventional
backstepping control is caused by the error term C1^xi. If
there exists an initial tracking error, the velocity demand
generated from the conventional backstepping control will not
start from zero, which implies the initial torque demand tends
to be inﬁnitely large and impractical. The larger the control
parameterC1, the larger the initial speed jump occurs. In
contrast, the shunting model acts like a low pass ﬁlter, which
not only yields the output to start from zero but also bounds
the output between a ﬁnite interval ( Di;Bi), making the
maximum velocity command as max (c;i) =C1Bi+ir.
Thus, a well designed bioinspired backstepping control could
avoid speed jump issue and restrict the maximum velocity.
C. Bioinspired Sliding Mode Control Design
Followed by the design of bioinspired backstepping control.
This subsection developed a bioinspired sliding mode control
that uses the same neural dynamics. Deﬁne the error between
the velocity commands and the estimated velocities that are
generated from the ﬁlter as

e1;i
e2;i
=
ci i
!ci !i
(34)
wheree1;iande2;iare respectively deﬁned as the linear and
angular velocity errors. It is noted that the estimated velocity
obtained from the ﬁlter can be converged to its actual value in
some mean square sense. iand!iare respectively the actual
linear and angular velocities. By setting the origin of the body
ﬁxed frame and gravity center to be at the same position, the
conventional design of the sliding mode dynamic controller is
given as
L;i=miri
2( _ci+Ca;isign(e1;i)) Iiri
2ci( _!ci+Cb;isign(e2;i))
(35)R;i=miri
2( _ci+Ca;isign(e1;i))+Iiri
2ci( _!ci+Cb;isign(e2;i))
(36)
whereCa;iandCb;iare the positive control parameters.
The above conventional sliding mode approach suffers from
the chattering issue, which generates discontinuous torque
commands that are impossible to reach by actuators. Thus, the
chattering term is replaced by the shunting model, deﬁning the
shunting models for linear and angular velocities as
_Vs1;i= A1;i+(B1;i Vs1;i)f(e1;i) (D1;i+Vs1;i)g(e1;i)
(37)
_Vs2;i= A2;i+(B2;i Vs2;i)f(e2;i) (D2;i+Vs2;i)g(e2;i)
(38)
Then, the bioinspired sliding mode torque control is proposed
as
L;i=miri
2( _ci+Ca;iVs1i) Iiri
2ci( _!ci+Cb;iVs2i) (39)
R;i=miri
2( _ci+Ca;iVs1i) +Iiri
2ci( _!ci+Cb;iVs2i) (40)
Remark 2. The chattering issue in the conventional slid-
ing control has been eliminated with the application of the
shunting model. Although there are other controllers such
as saturation functions to avoid chattering issue, the control
parameters Ca;iandCb;iin the conventional design does
not completely resolve the discontinuities in torque control
command when considering noises. The shunting model in this
case acts like a low pass ﬁlter, which yields smooth control
commands.
Remark 3. In order to overcome the disturbances, the control
parametersCa;i,Cb;itend to be large, which could potentially
provide explosive torque command. However, the shunting
model that is applied to sliding mode control offers extra ro-
bustness to disturbances without the requirements of large Ca;i
andCb;i. In addition, the shunting models are also bounded
between ( D1i;B1i)and( D2;i;B2;i)for the control of
linear and angular velocities, respectively.

If^xi<0, theng(^xi) = ^xiandf(^xi) = 0 , (43) also equals

It should be noted that both

the stability of the bioinspired sliding mode torque control
can be guaranteed by tuning these parameters. From (48), the
estimated velocity error is bounded. Since it is known that
the ﬁlter provides a precise velocity estimate for its actual
value, it concludes that the actual velocity error can be also
bounded. This, together with the stability from the bioinspired
backstepping control, also implies that the formation tracking
error is bounded as well. Thus, the overall stability of the
formation system proposed can be guaranteed.E. Adaptive sliding innovation ﬁlter
First, by letting the mass center and origin of the body ﬁxed
frame at the same point, giving the time step tand using
the Euler approximation, the mobile robot dynamic model
processed by the ASIF is given by
i;k+1=

ment noises at time step kofi-th robot;i;k+1and!i;k+1
are the linear and angular velocities, respectively; ^k+1is
the state measurements; and His the measurement matrix.
Then, the design of the ASIF shares a similar structure as the
KF, which uses a predictor-corrector estimation method. The
design procedures of ASIF follow a predicting stage as
~i;k+1jk=Ai;h~i;kjk+Bi;hc;i;k (51)
Pi;k+1jk=Ai;hPi;kjkAi;hT+Qi;k (52)

through the update stage as

~k+1jk+1=~k+1jk+Kk+1~zi;k+1jk (55)

whereiis the sliding boundary layer; Rk+1is the mea-
surement noise covariance; Ki;k+1is the sliding innovation
gain; ^k+1jk+1is the updated state estimate. Then, a sliding
innovation ﬁlter should be introduced. In the conventional
sliding innovation ﬁlter design, the sliding boundary iis
manually tuned. However, this ﬁlter only offers sub-optimal
solutions under normal operating conditions, since it does not
consider system noise covariance to update its state estimates.
Thus, the ASIF is developed to have more accurate state
estimates. The sliding boundary, sliding innovation gain, and
innovation covariance Si;k+1, are given by
Kk+1=H+

This completes the overall design of ASIF for mobile robots.
Remark 4. The Kalman ﬁlter is capable of providing optimal
results if the system is well known; however, if there are
modeling uncertainties or modeling errors in the estimator,
the Kalman ﬁlter fails to provide an accurate state estimate.
Thus, the ASIF is introduced, it not only provides accurate
state estimates under normal working conditions but also offers
extra robustness when modeling errors or uncertainties occur.7
Fig. 1. Communication setup and formation of mobile robots
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
This section provides various simulation results that demon-
strate the control performance of the proposed control method.
It is considered that there are four followers and a virtual
leader, the communication setups, shown in Figure 1, are
assumed to be given. The parameters for the estimator are
treated aski=I33,ka1=ka2= 20 ,kb1=kb2= 5. The
control parameters in the backstepping controller are treated
asC1;i= 3,C2;i= 2, andC3;i= 1, the parameters in the
conventional sliding mode dynamic controller are treated as
Ca;i= 3andCb;i= 3. The parameters of the shunting model
in the bioinspired backstepping kinematic controller are treated
asAi= 4,Bi=Di= 2, while the parameters of the shunting
model in the bioinspired sliding mode controller are treated as
A1;i= 4,B1;i= 6,A2;i= 4, andB2;i= 6.
To test the tracking performance of the proposed method,
the desired trajectory for the leader to track, is given by xd=t
andyd= 2 + sin(
2+t). The desired velocities of the leader
are calculated by
d=q
_x2
d+ _y2
d!d=yd_xd xd_yd
_x2
d+ _y2
d(60)
In addition, at the initial stage, the linear velocity follows
r=r(1 e t=0:5). The relative positions of the mobile robot
are treated as x1= 4,y1= 4,x2= 4,y2= 4,
x3= 7,y3= 7,x4= 7,y4= 7.
As shown in Figure 2. The proposed formation control
strategy makes the mobile robots maintain their prescribed
formation. Figure 3 further shows that the estimation error
converges to zero.
Furthermore, in Figure 4, when initial tracking errors occur,
the conventional backstepping method yields a velocity jump;
it is noted that initial tracking errors are calculated as ^x1= 1,
^x2= ^x3= 2, and ^x4= 5, which effectively shows that
the larger the initial tracking error, the higher the initial
required speed. In addition, the maximum linear velocity
that is required by conventional backstepping control reaches
15m/s at its maximum, which is impractical for an autonomous
robot operating at that rate of speed. On the other hand,
the bioinspired inspired backstepping control has successfully
avoided such a linear velocity jump; this implies that an

extremely large amount of torque would be needed to drive
the mobile robot to reach such a velocity immediately in the
conventional backstepping design. Thus, with the help of the
proposed bioinspired method, the speed jump issue has been
resolved.
Compare to the conventional sliding mode control and
second order sliding mode control, the bioinspired sliding
mode control provides smooth control inputs under the effects
of noise. The unique ﬁltering capability of the shunting model
is capable of ﬁltering out high-frequency noise to ease the
burden in the control system.
The root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the state
estimates and the actual states are shown in Table I. We ob-
serve that under normal conditions, the ﬁlters work perfectly)8

and the ASIF provides almost identical state estimates as the
Kalman ﬁlter does. However, when the condition becomes
noisy, the estimator could fail, resulting in inaccurate state
estimates. It is assumed that the estimator works perfectly for
10 seconds; after that, there is a fault injected into the system,
which makes the mass miand inertiaIithat are processed
by the ﬁlter change to 0:01miandIi= 0:1Ii, respectively.
Table II shows that, in a faulty case, the KF fails to provide
accurate state estimates, while the ASIF is still capable ofproviding relatively more accurate state estimates.
V.CONCLUSION
In this paper, the distributed leader follower formation
control problem has been addressed. Initially, a distributed
estimator is developed to estimate the leader’s states in order
to maintain a desired formation without needing to know the
leader’s states for all robots. Then, a distributed bioinspired
backstepping control is presented to address the velocity jump
problem that makes conventional designs impractical. After
that, a bioinspired sliding mode control is proposed to improve
the control robustness with smooth torque input. The ASIF
is integrated with the proposed control strategy to provide
accurate state estimates while maintaining robustness under
modeling errors. Finally, the proposed control has been rigor-
ously proven to be stable by Lyapunov theory, and multiple
simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness and
efﬁciency of the proposed formation control strategy.
In the future, a deeper investigation of robot communica-
tions such as denial of service attacks and noises that affect the
accuracy of the data transmission could be further addressed
to improve control effectiveness under various conditions. In
addition, more research on obstacle avoidance is expected to
improve the overall formation control efﬁciency.
