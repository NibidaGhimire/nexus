The axion is a hypothetical particle, a promising candidate for dark matter, and a solution to the strong
CP problem. Axion haloscope search experiments deal with a s ignal power comparable to noise
uncertainty at millikelvin temperature. We use a ﬂux-drive n Josephson parametric ampliﬁer (JPA)
with the aim of approaching a noise level near the theoretica lly allowed limit of half quanta. In our
measurements to characterize the JPA we have found the added noise to the system with a JPA as the
ﬁrst-stage ampliﬁer to be lower than 110 mK at the frequencie s from 0.938 GHz to 0.963 GHz.

1. Introduction
The axion is a hypothetical particle proposed by Pecci and Qu in to resolve the strong CP prob-
lem [1]. It is a strong candidate for dark matter, which is exp ected to cover about 85 %of all matter in
the universe [2–4]. The axion haloscope experiments search for axions by observing the microwave
photons converted from axions in a magnetic ﬁeld. Axion halo scope experiments use a cavity placed
in a magnetic ﬁeld in order to capture photons produced by axi ons penetrating the cavity [1]. An
antenna coupled to the cavity measures the electrical signa l power of the order of 10−22–10−23W.
To scan over the unknown mass and coupling constant of an axio n, the scan rate, which is inversely
proportional to the system noise, is very important. Experi ments with commercially available cryo-
genic ampliﬁers such as high-electron-mobility-transist or (HEMT) based ampliﬁers have a system
noise temperature in the range of 1 K–5 K, depending on the fre quency. Experiments with Josephson
parametric Ampliﬁers (JPA) can run at a noise level close to t he quantum limit. Noise-temperature
measurements of a JPA below 120 mK have been achieved [5–9]. S everal axion haloscope experi-
ments have implemented JPAs [10–13]. In this paper, we show t he characterization of a prototype
JPA chain which adds less than 110 mK to the total noise temper ature of the setup.
2. JPA
2.1 Design and Theory
Among the various JPA designs, we use a ﬂux-driven JPA [7] wit h a quarter-wavelength resonator
terminated by a superconducting quantum interference devi ce (SQUID), as shown in Fig. 1. The
interdigitated capacitor, the coplanar-waveguide transm ission line, and the coplanar-waveguide pump
1line are all made from niobium. The SQUID has an inner loop dia meter of about 16 µm and has
two Josephson junctions with an identical critical current of about 2µA. Both junctions are made
with Al/AlO x/Al technology. When the DC ﬂux passing through the loop is ﬁxe d, a quarter-wave
resonance is formed by the capacitor, transmission line, an d the eﬀective inductance of the SQUID.
The eﬀective inductance is
Le f f=Φ0
2πIc1
cosπΦ
Φ0, (1)
whereΦ0is the ﬂux quantum and Icis the critical current. The pump line couples an AC ﬂux to the
loop. When the AC ﬂux frequency is twice the resonance freque ncy, the JPA parametrically ampli-
ﬁes the signal. When an input signal mixes with a pumping sign al, one more tone appears with the
ampliﬁed signal at the output.

coil and external pump line.
2.2 RF-chain Schematic
The simpliﬁed RF chain is shown in Fig. 2. The directional cou pler introduces power to the
chain from the 50 Ωterminated noise source (NS) through the input port and the s ignal from the
VNA through the coupling port. The coupling line from the VNA has a total of 110 dB attenuation
distributed across temperature stages to prevent gain satu ration of the JPA and any noise from higher
temperature stages. Signals passing the JPA, ﬁlter, and iso lators are ampliﬁed by a commercial HEMT
ampliﬁer. We installed isolators and ﬁlters to reduce the no ise to the JPA caused by backaction from
the HEMT. Superconducting NbTi coaxial cables are used betw een NS, directional coupler, and other
temperature stages to reduce heat ﬂow and cable losses. At fr equencies away from the resonance
frequency, the JPA behaves like a perfect resonator with hig h out-of-band reﬂection at the input
capacitor.
2.3 Three-JPA PCB
We designed a printed circuit board (PCB) that has a three-wa y split signal input–output line
such that three JPAs can be connected to a single signal input , see Fig. 3. The input and pump
coplanar-waveguide transmission lines are split into thre e lines each split line go to a JPA. The
length of the splitted line is about 5 mm and much smaller than the operating signal wavelength and
the impedance mismatch is not signiﬁcant. Sub-Miniature Pu sh-on (SMP) connectors are placed on
the high-frequency laminate for a better microwave propert y. A superconducting-wire coil is wound
around the holder to provide a DC magnetic ﬂux bias. The PCB an d coil are inserted to a magnetic
shield to reduce the e ﬀect of external magnetic ﬁelds.

attenuation to the signal line. The mixing-Chamber (MXC) is maintained at temperatures in the range of 18
mK - 50 mK. The gain and power spectrum are measured using the v ector network analyzer (VNA) and the
spectrum analyzer (SA) respectively.

2.4 JPA-oﬀmeasurements
A JPA is oﬀwhen the resonance frequency is tuned away from the signal fr equency by the DC
ﬂux and when the pump signal is o ﬀ. When a JPA is oﬀ, we estimate the noise and gain of the chain
by measuring the power spectrum at the NS temperatures from 0 .1 K to 0.4 K. The Y-factor method
with reference to half quanta noise [16] was used to derive th e noise temperature of the JPA oﬀ. The
gain and noise temperature of the RF chain with the JPA oﬀare plotted in Fig. 4.
2.5 Flux sweep
The dependence of the JPA resonance frequency on the DC ﬂux bi as is shown in Fig. 5. Here the
phase shifts by the JPA resonance at frequencies 0 .944 GHz, 1.125 GHz, and 1.205 GHz are shown.
For this paper, the JPA (JPA-A) with the resonance at 0 .944 GHz is characterized. The quality factor
of JPA-A is about 700. We tune the JPA resonance within a frequ ency range by controlling the ﬂux
coil current as in Fig. 5(b). This JPA has a period of 50 µA shown in Fig. 5(b). In the frequency range
below 940 MHz the JPA has two stable points with di ﬀerent frequencies. This results in a hysteric
behavior in the ﬂux response [15].
2.6 Gain map
We scan over pump power ( Pp), pump frequency ( fp), and ﬂux coil current ( ib) to characterize the
gain of JPA-A as shown in Fig. 6. There are various factors lim iting these parameters for the axion
experiment. Increasing the gain of the JPA over 21 dB reduces the bandwidth, which may reduce
the practical scanning rate in axion search experiments by i ncreasing the number of the tuning steps
needed to cover the same frequency range. Three contour regi ons are shown in Fig. 6 (a).As our
measurement shows, Region 1 is not applicable because the ba ndwidth is half of that in Region 3.

Region 2 is not used because the JPA is working not in the three -wave-mixing mode, but in a higher
frequency mode with nonlinear behaviour. From Region 3 a set of points with gain between 18 dB
to 21 dB is selected. Points with the lowest pump power at cert ain ﬂux bias are further selected as
working points.
2.7 JPA on. Noise and Gain measurements
A JPA is described as being onwhen the parameters are tuned to a working point. We take the
power spectrum from the NS as a signal with the well known powe r (Pns) [16].

3. Conclusion
The RF chain with three JPAs as the ﬁrst ampliﬁer called Goryn ych design has been experi-
mentally studied. The chain is dedicated for axion haloscop e experiments. Three separate resonances
corresponding to each JPAs were observed. JPA-A has shown a p eriodic dependence on the exter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld and has shown ampliﬁcation with the noise t emperature lower than 110 mK. We
have characterized the chain with a JPA added noise between 6 5 mK and 110 mK at the frequencies
between 0.938 GHz and 0.963 GHz.
