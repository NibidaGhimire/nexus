ABSTRACT:  Electrokinetic flow can be generated as a highly coupled phenomenon among velocity field, electric conductivity field 
and electric field. It can exhibit different response s to AC electric field s in different frequency regimes, according to different insta-
bility /receptivity mechanism s. In this investigation, by both flow visualization and single -point laser -induced fluorescence  (LIF) 
method, the response of AC electrokinetic flow and the transition routes towards chaos and turbulence have been experimentally 
investigated.  It is found, when  the AC frequency  ùëìùëì<30 Hz, the interface responds at both the neutral frequency of the basic flow 
and the AC frequency. However, when ùëìùëì‚â•30 Hz, the inte rface responds only at the neutral frequency of the basic flow. Both 
periodic doubling and subcritical bifurcations have been observed in the transition of AC electrokinetic flow. We hope the current 
investigation  can promote our current understanding on t he ultrafast transition process of electrokinetic flow from laminar state to 
turbulence.  
Microfluidic systems use microscale channels to process , 
probe and manipulate  small -volume  fluid s and samples.  In re-
cent years, microfluidics has been rapidly developed as a break-
through technology , which is  widely used in various fields , e.g.  
chemical industry  1, biochemistry  2 and medical field 3, to realize 
cell culture  4, chemical components test 5 and analysis  6, DNA 
analysis  7 and liquid mixing  8 etc. As an effective approach, 
electrokinetic  (EK)  flow mechanism has been commonly used 
in the aforementioned research fields and applications.  
Previous in vestigations primarily focus on the electrokinetic 
instability  (EKI)  of flow, which  mainly describ es the develop-
ment of flow disturbance under the interactions between the 
electric  field and the fluid motion.  In 1998, Ramos et al.  9 sys-
tematically describe d the way to drive fluids through electroki-
netic mechanisms . They further showed  experimental and nu-
merical studies on AC electroosmosis to drive fluid flow at the 
electrode surface and obtain various  fluid velocit ies at the elec-
trode surface 10-12. In 2001, Oddy et al.  13 observed EKI in sinus-
oidal oscillatory electroosmotic channel flow . Relying on  this 
phenomenon , they  design ed a device to enable rapid mixing of 
two fluids. Later , Chen et al.  14 observed the EKI of the fluid in 
a microchannel driven by a DC electric field in an experiment 
and proposed a physical model for this instability.  In 2004, 
through experiment, theoretical analysis and numerical simula-
tion, Lin et al . 15. studied the EKI with a conductivity gradient 
orthogonal to the flow direction and an electric field applied to 
the flow direction . The results showed when the electric field is 
over 5√ó104 V/m, the flow starts to become unstable . Subse-
quently, in 2006, Posner et al.  16 presented an experimental 
study of convective EKI in a cross -shaped microchannel, where 
a low (high) conductivity centre stream flow between two sheath streams of high (low) conductivity  under an applied elec-
tric field . According t o EKI, when the conductivity of the sheath 
stream  is higher than the conductivity of the centre stream , the 
flow shape exhibits a ‚Äúpearl -necklace‚Äù  type structure . In con-
trast, when the conductivity of the sheath stream  is lower than 
the conductivity of the  centre stream , the flow shape exhibits a 
‚Äúwavy ‚Äù structure. The two structures of flow patterns have also 
been confirmed in follow -up experimental and numerical simu-
lation research  17,18. Later, Dubey et al. 19 elucidated the under-
line mechanisms of wavy and pearl -necklace type structures. 
When a single interface of electric conductivity gradient is pre-
sent, an inclined interface can be generated between the high 
and low electric conductivity fluids. In the limit of high electric 
Rayleigh numbers, the free charge accumulates at the slanted 
interfaces, where the net charge (ùúåùëí) is coupled with the electric 
field to drive the fluid motion. While two conductivity gra dient 
interfaces coexisted, the slanted electric conductivity perturba-
tions can be either in -phase or out -of-phase. For the former, the 
flow pattern is wavy, and for the latter, the flow pattern is pearl -
necklace type structures . In a follow -up study  20, based on the 
temporal power  spectrum analysis of the experimental data, the 
increase of the electric field first leads to the onset of EKI , and 
when the field is further increased, chaotic flow can be gener-
ated in the microchannel.   
Although the investigations above  have shown that the flow 
could evolve  into chaotic  flow, no direct clues have  demon-
strated that the unstable EK flow  confined in a microchannel  
can be developed into turbulence.  Compared to laminar and cha-
otic flow, turbulence is a more effective way of enhancing  mix-
ing and fluid transport . In macroflow , turbulence  can be easily 
generate d. However, in microfluidic systems, due to the smaller 
channel size and generally lower flow velocity, the Reynolds  2 number is usually very small and the flow state of the fluid is  
limited to laminar , not turbulence.  
In 2014, Wang et al. 21 designed a sophisticated EK  active 
micromixer and found that turbulence could be achieved in a 
low Reynolds number micro flow based on electrokinetic means.  
They  observed ma ny statistical properties which were believed 
to exist only in  macros cale high Reynolds number turbulence  
22,23, such as Kolmogorov -5/3 law of the velocity spectra , Obu-
khov -Corrsin -5/3 law of the concentration spectra  and etc . The 
EK turbulence leads to a fast mixing of momentum and scalar , 
especially a mixing length of O( 100 ¬µ m ) 24,25. 
However, till now, two key issues are still not clear. One is 
how the EK flow responds to the AC electric field , the other is 
how the EK flow evolves from laminar to turbulence . This paper 
mainly presents an experimental study to show the initially lin-
ear EKI from a frequency domain  using a single -point laser -in-
duced fluorescence (LIF) method . The evolution of the EK flow, 
from periodic perturbation due to EKI to random turbulen t flow , 
is also investigated by spectral analysis . 
THEORY  
The EK flow in this research is generated according to an 
electric conductivity gradient driven by an AC electric field. It 
involves  both momentum and scalar transport processes, where 
the momentum transport process can be described by the Na-
vier-Stokes equation with an electric body force (EBF) term 26, 
as shown below

where ùíñ=ùë¢ùíô+ùë£ùíö+ùë§ùíõ represents the velocity vector. ùë¢, ùë£ 
and ùë§ are the velocity components in the x, y and z directions 
respectively as shown in Figure 1(b).  ùíô, ùíö and ùíõ are unit vectors. 
œÅ is the fluid density, ùëù is the pressure on the fluid, and ùúÇ is the 
coefficient  of dynamic viscosity. ùë≠ùíÜ is the electric body force 
density, which is expressed as 9,23

where ùúåùëí=‚àá‚àô(ùúÄùë¨). Here, we approximate ùúÄ to be constant, 
then, the third term of Eq. (2) is ignored. The EBF is tightly 
associated with electric conductivity ( ùúé) distribution, which is 
controlled by a convection -diffusion equation

where ùê∑ùúé is the effective diffusivity of ùúé. Furthermore, the flow 
structures and scalar transport are investigated by laser  induced  
fluorescence through measuring the fluorescent dye concentra-
tion ( ùëê), thus  
ùúïùëê
ùúïùë°+ùíñ‚àô‚àáùëê=ùê∑ùëö‚àá2ùëê                              (4) 
where ùê∑ùëö is the diffusivity of fluorescent dye.  It should be 
noted that, in the transport of the scalars, ùúé is an active scalar if 
an electric field is applied, while ùëê is a passive one regardless of  
the electric field.  
Linear  response regime  
Initially, when the electric field intensity is beyond some crit-
ical value, the EK f low becomes unstable. The flow can be ap-
proximated to 2D initially  with small perturbations . Eqs. (1) and 
(3) become

the property of temporal fluctuations of EBF is only determined 
by ùêπùëíùë¶. Furthermore, as Eq. ( 12) is a linear oscillation equation 
of ùë£‚Ä≤ forced by ùêπùëíùë¶, the response of ùë£‚Ä≤ is propo rtionally deter-

Since the velocity fluctuation of EK flow is coupled with ùúé‚Ä≤

The fluctuations of flow structures are a direct consequence 
of the AC electric field. However, according to the relations 
among ùúîùë£ùëê, ùúîùúéùëê, ùúîùëíùëê and ùúîùê∏, the EK flow can be distinguished 
into two cases .  
(1) if ùúîùê∏‚â´ùúîùë£ùëê‚âàùúîùúéùëê‚âàùúîùëíùëê, the direct coupling between 
the applied AC electric field and the fluctuations of flow struc-
tures  is absent . The EK flow cannot immediately respond to the 
applied AC electric field and will exhibit perturbations at much 
lower frequencies.  Thus, the terms ùêπ1 to ùêπ6 are negligible in the 
driving of ùë£‚Äô, while ùêπ7 and ùêπ8 must be dominant, even though 
these are nonlinear forcing term s. 
(2) if ùúîùê∏‚â§ùúîùë£ùëê‚âàùúîùúéùëê‚âàùúîùëíùëê, the applied AC electric field 
and the fluctuations of the flow structures have direct and strong 
coupling. Similar to a forced pendulum, ùë£‚Ä≤ share s imilar  spectra 
as ùêπùëíùë¶ in a linear instability/receptivity model .  Nonlinear response regime  
When the applied AC electric field is sufficiently strong, the 
flow becomes highly disturbed. The flow evol ves from linear 
response to nonlinear response through two routes. One is that 
the nonlinear forcing terms, including ùêπ5 to ùêπ8, can introduce 
multifrequency influence into ùêπ(ùúî) directly , and thus  ùêπùúé(ùúî) 
and ùêπùê∏(ùúî). The other is through the  interactions of ùë¢‚Äô, ùë£‚Äô and ùúé‚Äô 
by their nonlinear terms , as can be seen in the control equations

When the electric field is sufficiently high, strong ùë£‚Ä≤ is in-
duced first, and then, strong ùúé‚Ä≤ and ùë¢‚Ä≤ are obtained.  The nonlin-
ear terms, e.g. ùë£‚Ä≤ùúïùë¢‚Ä≤

lution of ùêπ(ùúî) and ùêπùúé(ùúî). In the weakly nonlinear region, the 
evolution of the velocity power spectrum ùëÜ(ùúî)=ùêπ‚àó(ùúî)‚àô
ùêπ(ùúî) among different frequency components behave according 
to resonant interaction theory  28-30. The theory shows, even if a 
single frequency component of ùêπ(ùúî) is injected into the flow, 
through the nonlinear terms, the kinetic ene rgy can be trans-
ported to other frequency components and may eventually form 
a wide band of  ùëÜ(ùúî) and ùëÜùúé(ùúî)=ùêπùúé‚àó(ùúî)‚àôùêπùúé(ùúî). However, 
when the flow is highly disturbed with strong nonlinearity, 
ùëÜ(ùúî) and ùëÜùúé(ùúî)should be described according to Zhao -Wang 
model  27.

ùêπ(ùúî) is also a peak of ùêπùëê(ùúî).  4 Physical model of the EKI.  
The evolution of the EK flow under increasing electric field 
intensity can be schematically elucidated as in Figure 1. When 
no AC electric field, due to the intrinsic instability of the diver-
gent channel flow, the interface fluctuates at its neutral fre-
quency slightly , which  can be discovered only by a highly sen-
sitive experimental method  (Figure 1(a)) . Similar results can 
also be observed i f a low -frequency AC electric field  with a 
small amplitude  is applied . The difference is the latter fluctuates 
at the frequency of the AC electric field.  As the electric field is 
further increased, as shown in Figure 1( b, c), the interface be-
comes highly disturbed. The fluctuations of velocity and electric 
conductivity near the interface are significantly enhanced , with 
more frequency components  (especially the harmonic and sub-
harmonic ones ) developed by the aforementioned nonlinear 
mechanisms. Then, the emerged  frequency components become 
stronger under higher electric field intensity, which in turn, 
leads to the broaden ing of the spectral bands of both velocity 
and electric conductivity. T he flow experiences a transition to  
chaotic and turbulen t, as diagramed i n Figure 1(d) .

increasing electric field.  
EXPERIM ENTAL SETUP  
Optical system  
In this research, the electric conductivity fluctuations in a mi-
cromixer were  investigated with a single -point LIF  by measur-
ing fluorescent intensity,  through  a home -developed confocal 
microscope , as shown in Figure 2(a). In the system, the excita-
tion beam is generated by  a continuous wave  (CW) laser of 405 
nm wavelength  (MDL -III-405-500, CNI). In order to improve 
the quality of the laser beam, the beam first pass es through a 
spatial light filter  (SLF, SFB -16DM, OptoSigma) , then colli-
mate with a lens. The laser beam is reflected by a dichroic mir-
ror (Di03 -R405/532 -t1-25√ó 36, Semrock)  and focused in to the 
microchannel to excite fluorescent dye by  an Olympus 100√ó  NA 
1.4 oil immersion objective lens. The fluorescent signal passes 
through the dichroic mirror , filtered  by a bandpass filter ( 470/10 
nm, OptoSigma ), and then, is  focused into a multimode optical 
fiber (25 Œºm in diameter, 400 -550 nm band, M67L01, Thorlabs) . 
At last, the fluorescent signal was detected by a single photon 
counter ( Hamamatsu H7421 ). The spatial resolution of the con-
focal microscope is ~ 180 nm 31.

Solution Preparation  
In the experiment, we use d coumarin 102  (C102, Sigma Al-
drich)  as the fluorescent agent . Its excitation peak locates at 390 
nm and the emission peak locates at 470 nm.  In the LIF experi-
ments, to avoid the influence of photobleaching on the measure-
ment of fluorescent concentration. Both the excitation beam 
power and the concentration of C102 are ultra-low. C102 has a  
concentration of 0 5 ŒºM  During experiments, 3 mL of deion-
ized water  and 7 mL of aqueous alcohol  (concentration > 99.5%)  
were mixed to dissolve 2.5 mg C102 powder and prepare  a 1 
mM C102 fluorescent solution.  Then,  20 ŒºL of the 1 mM C102 
fluorescent solut ion was further diluted with 39. 98 mL of de-
ionized  water to obtain a C102 fluorescent solution at a concen-
tration of 0 5 ŒºM  In the expe riment, we keep the electric con-
ductivity ratio  between the water solution and C102 fluorescent 
solution  at 1:5250 (water solution with ùúé1=0.4 ŒºS cm‚àí1and 
C102 fluorescent solution with ùúé2=2100  ŒºS cm‚àí1). The con-
ductivity of the solution is changed  by adding  phosphate buff-
ered saline (PBS) (HyClone, SH30256.01, USA) . 
Fabrication of the micromixer chip  
Previous investig ations 32 indicate a mixing chamber with 
slightly divergent side walls can significantly enhance mixing, 
since such type flow (also known as Jeffery -Hamel flow)  is 
more unstable than that in parallel -plate  channel . Nevertheless, 
in our previous research, the side walls were fabricated directly 
with two Pt plates. This can cause difficult ies in the industrial 
 5 production  of the EK micromixer chip and lead to a waste of 
expensive metal.  
In this investigation , the micromixer was fabricated by soft 
lithography . The schematic of the chip is shown in Figure 2 (b). 
The micromixer has a splitter plate with a sharp trailing edge at 
the inlet of the mixing chamber, which is 9 mm  long ( ùëô). Two Pt 
electrodes of 1 mm diameter are symmetrically assembled at the 
inlet. The distance between the two electrodes, which is the in-
itial width  (ùë§) of the mixing chamber, is 650 Œºm  The electro des 
naturally form a divergent mixing chamber with bending sur-
faces. Thus, the basic flow is also unstable and sensitive  to ex-
ternal disturbance. At the downstream of the electrodes, the 
PDMS walls also have a sustained divergent angle of 5¬∞ .  
The fabricati on process of the micromixer chip is demon-
strated  in Figure 3. Firstly, a 50 ¬µm thick layer of SU8 -3025 
photoresist (Microchem, Westborough, Ma , USA)  was spin -
coated on the silicon wafer at 1500 rpm for 30 s , and then baked. 
Since  the microchannel was designed to have a height of  100 
¬µm, the above procedure was repeated twice . The coated wafer 
was exposed to UV light at an exposure intensity of 20 mW/ cm2 
in a mask aligner (MIDAS , MDA4LJ , Korea) . After exposure,  
the wafer was further baked on a hotplate. Then, the unexposed 
SU8-3025 photoresist was removed by SU-8 developer.  The 
PDMS solution (Momentative, RTV -615, USA)  was coated 
onto the patterned wafer , degassed  in a vacuum desiccator (Baiji, 
PC-3, China ), and then cured at 80 ¬∞ C. After curing, the inlet, 
outlet and electrode holes were punched with a punch er. Finally, 
the patterned PDMS and coverslips were placed in a plasma 
washer (Harr ick, PDC -002, USA), bonding  to finish the fabri-
cation of the micromixer chip . 
 
Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the fabrication process of the 
micromixer chip.  
Flow Visualization  
The mixing process is monitored by flow visualization , as 
shown in Figure 4, by an inverted fluorescent microscope  (Nex-
cope, NIB900, China ). One solution is deionized (DI) water , 
and the other is fluorescein sodium salt solution ( SIGMA , 
46970 -100G , Germany ). The fluorescent dye is excited by a 473 
nm CW laser  and emits  green fluorescent light around  515 nm. 
By properly adding PBS buffer solution, the conductivity ratio 
between DI water and the fluorescent solution is about  1:5000 , 
which is closely consistent with the confocal microscopic meas-
urement . In order to visualize the interface between the two 
streams clearly  with a sufficiently high  signal -to-noise  ratio, the 
concentration of fluorescein sodium salt solution  is 500 Œºmol/L. 
The fluorescence is captured by a  SCMOS camera  (PCO edge 
4.2LT, Germany )  The exposure time of the camera is 1 ms.   
EK flow system  
A pressure -driven basic flow is provided by a dual -channel 
syringe pump (HARVARD Apparatus PUMP 33).  The fluores-
cent solution and DI water are pu mped into the microchannel 
through two inlets. The flow rates of both streams are 3 ŒºL/min  
each. To disturb the flow field electrokinetically, AC electric fields with different frequenc ies ( ùëìùëì) have  been applied by an  
arbitrary function generator (Tektronix, AFG3102C, USA) and 
a high-voltage amplifier (Trek, PZD700A, USA) . The actual 
output from the high -voltage amplifier is further monitored by  
an oscilloscope  (Tektronix , MSO2022B, USA) . 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  
Flow Visu alization  
In the experiment, the fluorescein sodium salt solution emits  
fluorescence  under excitation , while DI water does not. When 
no AC voltage is applied  (Figure 4(a)), the flow is steady and 
stratified, with the concentration interface between the two 
streams clearly observed. Although the inter face is slightly bi-
ased to the DI water due to the fabrication deviation , the inter-
face is stable and no distinguishable perturbation s were ob-
served  from the flow visualization , except an external disturb-
ance (e.g. vibration  from the syringe pump  or a knock ) was ap-
plied . In Figure 4(b), when the  applied electric field is ùëìùëì=130 
kHz with ùëâ=24.2 Vp‚àíp, i.e. ùê∏ùëä=ùëâ/2ùë§=1.86√ó104 V/m 
(ùëâ is the applied peak -to-peak voltage bet ween two electrodes ), 
it can be seen that the interface is perturbated , indicating the  EK 
flow is no longer steady . As ùê∏ùëä is further increased to 
2.74√ó104 (Figure 4(c)), the interface becomes rolling up and 
forms an e ntrainment of the fluids. However, in the current case, 
the flow has limited structures primarily on large scales. As 
shown in Figure s 4(d) and (e), accompanied by the increasing 
ùê∏ùëä, the perturbation of the flow is significantly enhanced, with 
a larger spreading rate. The mixing is enhanced as well  with 
small scale flow structures rapidly developed . When ùê∏ùëä=
8.12√ó104 V/m, the EK flow exhibits an ultrafast mixing with 
fine structures, as  shown in Figure 4(f). The evolution of the 
mixing process is  consistent with previous studies 21,25 in flat   
 
Figure 4 . Flow visualization of the flow structures. The con-
ductivity ratio of the two streams is 1:5000. The exposure

Single -point LIF for concentration measurement  
At the inlet of the micromixer, a sharp interface is generated 
between the two streams. The width of the interface can be es-
timated as ùë§ùëñùëõ=‚àö4ùê∑ùëöùë°=‚àö4ùê∑ùëöùë•/ùëàùëö, where ùëàùëö is the 
mean flow velocity at the centerline of the microchannel. At the 
position ùë•‚àó=ùë•/ùë§=0.23 where concentration measurement is 
conducted, assuming ùê∑ùëö=5√ó10‚àí10 m2/s, ùë§ùëñùëõ is approxi-
mately 11.4 ¬µm with a larger gradient of fluorescent concentra-
tion. At these positions, a small perturbation of the flow can lead 
to an amplified fluc tuation of fluorescence, as shown in Figure 
5. Therefore, by detecting the fluctuations of fluorescence, the 
onset of EK instability can be sensitively measured. With the 
single -point LIF system, we can continuously monitor the evo-
lution of EK flow from it s onset of EKI at a low electric field to 
a turbulent state at a high electric field.  
 
Figure 5.  Schematic of a small perturbation of the flow lead 
to an amplified fluctuation of fluorescence.  
When using LIF to monitor the fluorescen ce fluctuations, the 
influence of photobleaching should be inhibited, otherwise , the 
fluorescen ce fluctuations  are not only determined by  concentra-
tion variation , but also  contaminated by the velocity fluctuations  
22,33 -35. Therefore, we selected a small dye concentration and low 
excitation beam power to in hibit the influence of photob leach-
ing. The laser power at the pupil is only 0.3 mW  and the con-
centration of  the C102 solution  is only 0 5 ŒºM  As shown in 
Figure 6, the fluorescen t intensity (ùêºùëì) is nearly flat with the flow 
velocity , indicating irrelevance between the fluorescence and 
flow velocity . The fluorescence is only determined by the con-
centration of fluorescent dye.

are dominated by noise. No flow structures can be distinguished 
from the time series. Similar results can also be found in Figure 
7(b), where a small ùê∏ùëä is applied . As ùê∏ùëä is further increased to 
ùê∏ùëä=2.74√ó104 V/m, the time series exhibits periodi c fluctu-
 7 ations  (Figure 7(c))  indicating periodic concentration fluctua-
tions in the flow field . This is also consistent with the flow vis-
ualization in Figure 4(c).  
When ùê∏ùëä is further increas ed, e.g. at 4.18√ó104 V/m (Fig-
ure 7(d)) and 5.91√ó104 V/m (Figure 7(e)) , ùëê‚Ä≤‚àó exhibits not 
only periodicity, but also intermittency, showing a ramp -cliff 
structure  36, a feature of turbulence from the concentration field. 
If we keep increas ing the electric field to ùê∏ùëä=8.12√ó104 
V/m, strong perturbation of ùëê‚Ä≤‚àó with multiple frequency compo-
nents can be directly observed from the time series.  Relative to 
Figure 7(a), which is also typical random fluctuations primarily 
at small scales, the turbulent flow state  in Figure 7(f) has more 
structures with different s cales.  
The evolution of EK flow with increasing electric field leads 
to an augmentation of mixing and a transition of flow. This can 
be seen from  the plot of ùëêùëüùëöùë†~ùê∏ùëä in Figure 8. As ùê∏ùëä is in-
creased, ùëêùëüùëöùë† increases first and then decreases. At ùê∏ùëä=
5.91√ó104 V/m, a maximum ùëêùëüùëöùë† is reached . When ùê∏ùëä<
5.91√ó104 V/m, a stronger mixing is reached  at a larger ùê∏ùëä, 
indicating stronger flow perturbation and accompanied mixing 
due to the EK mechanism . The result can also be found in Figure 
4. However, when ùê∏ùëä>5.91√ó104 V/m, the declining ùëêùëüùëöùë† 
with ùê∏ùë§ indicating the mixing is so fast at sufficiently large ùê∏ùë§ 
that a uniform mixing can be realized adjacent to the trailing 
edge.  This is why ùëêùëüùëöùë† becomes smaller. Accordingly, we can 
deduce the flow is highly disturbed with intense velocity fluctu-
ations. A turbulent state is indirectly unfolded .

Neutral  frequency of basic flow  instability  
To reveal the presence of instability at the interface of the two 
fluids in the micromixer, the frequency responses of the flow 
with and without AC electric fields are investigated through  the 
power spectrum  (ùëÜ(ùëì)) calculated from the time traces  of ùêºùëì‚Ä≤.  
Figure 9(a) shows the ùëÜ(ùëì) without AC electric field, to indi-
cate the possible  influence of basic flow  instability . Although 
the bulk flow Reynolds number  (ùëÖùëí=ùëàùëë/ùúà, where ùëà, ùëë and ùúà 
are the bulk flow velocity, the hydraulic diamet er and the kine-
matic viscosity ) is below 0.33, frequency pea ks can always be 
observed from the spectra, indicating an intrinsically unstable 
model of the flow. The neutral frequency  (ùëìùëõ) of the unstable 
flow depends strictly on the flow rate , as shown in Figure 9(b). 
The ùëìùëõ are all linearly changed with the flow rate ùëÑ and 
uniquely fall on a curve , i.e. ùëìùëõ~ùëÑ. The results  are consistent 
with that in low Reynolds number wake after sharp trailing edge 
in macroscale flows  37, where the neutral frequency  is approxi-
mately ùëìùëõ~ùëà. Also, changing the electric conductivity ratio to a 
much smaller value won‚Äôt affect the unstable frequency plot   
One interesting observation is, when a n AC electric field with 
ùê∏ùëä=2.74√ó104 V/m and ùëìùëì=130 kHz was applied, the re-
sponse frequency ( ùëìùëü) of the EK flow is exactly the same as ùëìùëõ, for both electric  cond uctivity ratio s of 1:2 and 1: 5250  (Figure 
9(b)) . In other words, the EK flow at a high AC frequency 
doesn‚Äôt lead to a new instability other than the basic flow

and conductivity ratio is 1: 5250 . (b) ùëìùëü vs ùëÑ at different ùê∏ùëä

kHz.   
ùë∫(ùíá) under different ùíáùíá  
Initial  stage  
To further reveal  the frequency response of the EK flow , a 
broad AC frequency range, from 3 Hz to 130 kHz , has been ap-
plied . It is found, depending on the frequency response, the AC 
frequency range can be distinguished into t wo subranges , corre-
sponding  to two different flo w instability/receptivity regimes . 
(1) As shown in Figure 10, when the AC frequency is below 30 
Hz, for instance, at ùëìùëì=4 Hz, there are two spectral peaks ob-
served. One is at the neutral frequency , i.e. ùëìùëõ=6 Hz, when 
ùëÑ=3 ŒºL/min  The other is at the forcing frequency, i e  4 Hz  
Since the applied AC voltage is only ùëâ=8 Vp‚àíp, the EK flow 
fluctuates linearly to the external electric field, forming a forced 
oscillation system . In this case, the peak  of ùëÜ(ùëì) locates  at ùëìùëì, 
indicating the concentration fluctuation (which is also the fluc-
tuation of electric conductivity ) has ùëìùëü=ùëìùëì. Since the peak of 
ùëÜ(ùëì) is also corresponding  to the peak of velocity power spectra 
according to Eq. ( 35), the flow is perturbed at  the AC frequency  
as well . This observation is interesting  since it can only be 
achieved in two cases. One is that  ùúåùëí still keeps unchanged at a 
low frequency. The othe r is really ‚Äútricky ‚Äù that, in ùê∏ùëäeùëñùúîùê∏ùë°, ùúé‚Ä≤ 
and ùê∏ùë¶‚Ä≤, two of them  have exactly inverse phases , but the same 
frequenc ies. Therefore, by the forcing terms ùêπ2 to ùêπ6, and ùêπ8, it 
is also possible to have ùëìùëü=ùëìùëì.  
(2) When the AC frequency is equal to or above 30 Hz, even 
though a larger electric field ùê∏ùëä=2.74√ó104 V/m has been 
applied, there is only a single peak observed at the neutral fre-
quency (e.g. ùëìùëõ=6 Hz). This indicates, on the one hand, when 
a high -frequency AC electric field was applied, the AC EK in-
stability plays a part  to generate flow disturbance indirectly, and  
 8 relies on  the instability of the basic flow.  Furthermore, t he ex-
perimental results also show that a t the same AC voltage, the 
concentra tion fluctuation is the greatest and most unstable  at 
ùëìùëì=130 kHz.  This implies, on the other hand, the response  of 
the basic flow to the AC electric field is not the same. The basic 
flow exhibits a  higher receptivity at a higher AC frequency .

under ùê∏ùëä=2.74√ó104 V/m and different AC frequencies.  
Here, ùëÑ=3 ŒºL/min  The electric conductivity ratio is 
1:5250 . Note, o nly at ùëìùëì=4 Hz, the applied  ùê∏ùëä=6.15√ó
103 V/m, to avoid electrolysis .  
Evolution with increasing electric Rayleigh number  
The different receptivity of the flow to AC EBF also leads to 
a different transitional route to chao s and turbulence. Here, we 
use ùëìùëì=4 Hz as an example to show the evolution of the EK 
flow with electric Rayleigh number  (ùëÖùëé ùëí=4ùúé2‚àíùúé1
ùúé2+ùúé1ùúÄùê∏ùë§2ùë§02(1‚àí
ùõΩ2)/ùúåùúàùê∑ùúé) 25. As shown in Figure 11, when ùëÖùëéùëí=3.03√ó104, 
ùëÜ(ùëì) has two peaks at ùëìùëü=ùëìùëì and ùëìùëü=ùëìùëõ respectively.  As ùëÖùëéùëí 
is increased to ùëÖùëé ùëí=ùëÖùëéùëíùëê=9.27√ó104, a second harmonic 
frequency of ùëìùëì is observed , indicat ing the onset of nonlinearity 
in the evolution of EK flow , with ùëÖùëéùëíùëê being the critical electric 
Rayleigh number . Accordingly, linear instability theory be-
comes  inaccurate when ùëÖùëéùëí‚â•ùëÖùëéùëíùëê.  
The peak magnitudes of ùëÜ(ùëì) increase further with ùëÖùëéùëí till 
1.53√ó105, where ùëÜ(ùëì) exhibits more peaks at the harmonic 
freque ncies of ùëìùëì, e.g. at 2ùëìùëì=8 Hz and 3ùëìùëì=12 Hz as well. 
In the following, ùëÜ(ùëì) experiences a rapid development for both 
the magnitudes and spectral ranges , as ùëÖùëéùëí is increased to 
1.89√ó105. The harmonic components of ùëìùëì grow rapidly first. 
Then, t he subharmonic components, i.e. ùëìùëì/2 and 3ùëìùëì/2, grow 
after the harmonic components  (see also Figure 12(b)).  
 
 
Figure 11. Temporal power spectra of concentration under 
ùëìùëì=4 Hz and different electric Rayleigh numbers. Here 
ùëÑ=3 ŒºL/min and the conductivity ratio is 1: 5250 . It should be noted, when forcing at low frequencies, the 
route s to chaos are different at different ùëìùëì. As shown in Figure 
12(a), when ùëìùëì=3 Hz, the odd -order harmonic components in-
crease faster and earlier than the even -order counterparts, ac-
cording to the higher magnitudes at the peaks. While ùëìùëì=10 
Hz (Figure 12(c)), besides the harmonic components of ùëìùëì, the 
peaks also appear at 2ùëìùëì/5, 3ùëìùëì/5 and their combinations.   
The evolution of the harmonic and subharmonic frequencies 
shows  that the scalar variance and the corresponding kinetic en-
ergy are transported along wavenumbers through both resonant 
interaction mechanism s (e.g. resonant triads with ùúî3=ùúî1+
ùúî2) 30 along the nonlinear velocity terms  and the direct energy 
injection by nonlinear forcing terms. Both of them lead to the 
transition of the initially laminar flow to chaotic flow . In the 
former, the examples can commonly exist from Figure 12. For 
instance, at ùëìùëì=10 Hz, ùúî1=2ùúãùëìùëì (corresponding to ùëìùëìùëì‚ÅÑ =
1) and ùúî2=2
5√ó2ùúãùëìùëì (corresponding to ùëìùëìùëì‚ÅÑ =2/5), then a 
peak is observed at ùúî3=7
5√ó2ùúãùëìùëì (corresponding to ùëìùëìùëì‚ÅÑ =
7/5). At the low AC frequency, a turbulent flow has not been 
observed, since the applied electric field cannot be sufficiently 
high. Otherwise, electrolysis can induce air bubble s which se-
verely affect the flow field and internal electric field.   
 
Figure 12. Peaks of temporal power spectra of concentration 
under ùëâ=35.6 Vp‚àíp. at 3 ŒºL/min  and different forcing fre-
quencies.  (a) ùëìùëì=3 Hz. (b) ùëìùëì=4 Hz. (c) ùëìùëì=10 Hz.  
When ùëìùëì is equal to or beyond 30 Hz, there is no receptivity 
at the AC frequency. For instance, u nder ùëÑ=3 ŒºL/min , when 
unforced, there is a small peak at 6 Hz corresponding to the in-
trinsical ly unstable mode of the basic flow, as shown in Figure 
13. When forced at ùëìùëì=130 kHz and ùëÖùëéùëí=2.77√ó105, the 
peak of ùëÜ(ùëì) is still at 6 Hz, with the magnitude  clearly en-
hanced. As ùëÖùëéùëí increases to ùëÖùëéùëíùëê=6.00√ó105, beyond the 
fundamental frequency (i.e. 6 Hz), ùëÜ(ùëì) exhibit s an additional  
peak at the second harmonic frequency , i.e. 12 Hz .  
When  the electric Rayleigh number is further increased  to 
ùëÖùëéùëí=1.00√ó106, the magnitudes of ùëÜ(ùëì) increase rapidly, 
 9 with a much wider spectral band. A slight shift of the fundamen-
tal frequenc y is also observed. T he second , third and higher -or-
der harmonics  all exhibit large magnitudes , which can be  at-
tributed to the nonlinear forcing terms, e.g. ùêπ8, and the nonlinear 
coupling terms, e.g. ùë£‚Ä≤ùúïùë£‚Ä≤
ùúïùë¶ and ùë£‚Ä≤ùúïùúé‚Ä≤
ùúïùë¶ etc. Due to the nonliearit y, 
the EK f low exhibits  more small -scale  and high -frequency  
structure s, which almost form a continuous spectrum . When 
ùëÖùëéùëí=1.40√ó106, the fundamental frequency continuously 
shifts towards higher frequency, with increasing bandwidth . As 
ùëÖùëéùëí is finally increased to  2.14√ó106, a broad and continuous 
spectrum with a slope of -1.38 is formed. From the figure, it can 
be seen the scaling subrange appears first at high frequency, and 
develops towards both higher and lower frequency regimes. 
This is consistent with the Zhao -Wang model  27 and support s 
that EBF is dominant on small scales . Furthermore , from both 
the flow visualization and ùëÜ(ùëì), it can be concluded that EK 
flow is turbulent now.

ùëìùëì=130 kHz and different electric Rayleigh number s. Here 
ùëÑ=3 ŒºL/min and the conductivity ratio of the streams is

DISCUSSION  
To this end, the route s of the EK flow toward chaotic and tur-
bulent state s have been revealed experimentally , as diagramed 
in Figure 14. When ùëÖùëéùëí is increased, a series of bifurcations 
emerge, however, through different routes relying on ùëìùëì. For in-
stance, in Figure 14(a), when ùëìùëì=4 Hz, the nonlinearity of EK 
flow initiates at  ùëÖùëéùëíùëê=9.27√ó104. When ùëÖùëéùëí‚â•1.89√ó105, 
ùëÜ(ùëì) shows a peak at ùëìùëì/2 indicating the onset of periodic dou-
bling bifurcation  38. Then , as can be more clearly explained by  
resonant interaction theory  28-30, a series of peaks is generated  at 
both the harmonic frequencies of ùëìùëì and ùëìùëì/2, and towards 
chaos when ùëÖùëéùëí is further increased .  
While for the flow driven by ùëìùëì=130 kHz, the transition might 
be attributed to a subcritical bifurcation, according to recent nu-
merical investigations  39 on electroconvection   Its development 
can also be presented by the resonant int eraction theory 28-30 at 
the weakly nonlinear regime and lead to the fast development of 
EK flow in Fig ure 14(b). Nevertheless, a deeper understanding 
of the transitions of the EK flow can only be reached with a 
detailed and time -resolved numerical simulation.  
CONCLUSION  
In this investigation, the evolution of electrokinetic flow in a 
microfluidics chip with cylindrical electrodes and divergent 
walls has been investigated experimentally. It is found that 
when an AC electric field is applied to the flow, the interface is 
perturbed with different response frequencies. When ùëìùëì<30 
Hz, the interface responds at both the neutral frequency of the

basic flow and the AC frequency.  When ùëìùëì‚â•30 Hz, the inter-
face responds only at the neutral frequency of the basic flow.  
The different response s to the AC frequency reveal different in-
stability/receptivity mechanism s of the electrokinetic flow, and 
accordingly, the different routes to chaos and turbulence. We 
hope the present work provides a n experimental foundation to 
understand the complex inter actions among the velocity field, 
electric conductivity field and electric field. It could also con-
tribut e to the design of novel microfluidic devices.
