Abstract 
The Laves ph ase skeleton in cast Mg -Al-Ca alloys is known to provide considerable strengthening. 
Laves phases such as CaMg 2 (C14) , Ca(Al,Mg) 2 (C36),  and CaAl 2 (C15) have high melting points , high 
hardness at  room and elevated temperatures , but unfortunately are inherently brittle.  Mg-Al-Ca alloys 
thus have good creep properties but limited ductility. An understanding of the co-deformation behaviour 
of Œ±-Mg and Laves phases is essential for optimising the strength- ductility  balance  of these  alloys. Here, 
we study the me chanical behaviour of a Mg -4.65Al-2.82Ca alloy using micropillar compression in the 
Œ±-Mg matrix, at Œ± -Mg/C36  and Œ±-Mg/C15 interfaces and in the C15 phase in combination with scanning 
electron microscopy ( SE imaging), electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ), transmission Kikuchi 
diffraction ( TKD) , and low -kV scanning transmission electron microscopy ( STEM ). We show that 
both, C15 and C36, Laves phases provide considerable strengthening to the Œ±-Mg matrix by delaying 
the onset of basal slip  and extension twinning, while only the C36 phase appears to allow a certain 
exten t of slip transfer/ plastic co -deformation , in spite of its greater anisotropy compared with the cubic 
C15 phase.  We therefore conclude based on these results that  strengthening of the  Œ±-Mg matrix by the 
C36 Laves phase is preferable given that it combines easy skeleton formation with some co -deformation 
and considerable stability at common application temperatures of magnesium alloys.

 Introduction  
Laves phase containing Mg -Al-Ca alloys exhibit superior creep resistance when  compared to 
conventional Mg- Al-Mn or Mg -Al-Zn alloys [1 -3]. These Laves phases reinforcing the Mg -Al-Ca 
alloys are characterised by  high strength [4] , hardness [4-7] and melting points [5]  when  compared to 
the Œ± -Mg matrix [6] . In cast Mg -Al-Ca alloys, the  Laves phase s are present as an intra-  and intergranular 
skeleton within the Œ±-Mg matrix [6, 8- 11]. Knowledge about the amount of streng thening induced by 
Laves phases in the Mg matrix is important and can be helpful for alloy design. However, even where 
overall strengthening of an alloy is observed due to the introduction of a second phase, it is the 
understanding of which deformation mec hanisms are affected , and in which way, that really opens 
purposeful microstructure and composition design strategies.  
Previous work on Mg- Al-Ca alloys has mainly focussed on the identification of advantageous 
microstructures with respect to the formation  of an intermetallic skeleton and the macroscopic  
properties that can be obtained as a result  [2, 8, 11- 13]. For those alloys with the mo st promising 
properties, the co- deformation mechanisms were also explored  [6, 10] . These alloys have  in common 
that they contain the Ca(Mg,Al) 2 C36 phase as the dominant strengthening Laves phase. What is not 
known is whether one of the other Laves phases of the Mg- Al-Ca system may in principle give better 
co-deformation performance in offering equally or better high temperature stability and creep resistance 
while allowing plastic co -deformation of the matrix and intermetallic skeleton at stress concentrations 
to avoid cracking and void formation that lead  to early failure. In this respect, the cubic CaA l2 phase is 
of particular interest. It is known to be harder than the other Laves phases  [5, 14, 15] , making it possibly 
harder to co- deform, but as a cubic phase also likely offers a larger number of slip systems, which may 
align with the basal plane of the hexagonal Mg matri x to allow dislocations to cross the interface.  
The most easily activated deformation mechanisms of Mg at room temperature are basal slip and 
extension twinning. This is because the critical resolved shear stresses , ùúèùúèùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂, required to activate basal 
slip and extension twinning , amount to ‚âà 0.5 MPa [16, 17]  and <10 MPa [18, 19] , respectively. On the 
other hand, the stresses req uired to activate prismatic and pyramidal <a> slip in Mg are ‚âà 39- 44 MPa 3 
 [20-23]. This large difference between the ùúèùúèùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ for activation of different deformation mechanisms 
usually result s in a strong mechanical anisotropy at ambient temperature [24, 25] . Consequently, large 
differences are found between the yield stresses when the crystals are deformed along different 
directions [26-28]. Considering this, if micropillar testing is carried out on different  crystal orientation s 
in a comparison o f micropillars from the two different microstructural regions (Œ± -Mg and Œ± -Mg/Laves 
phase interfaces) , then the orientation dependence of deformation in the Œ±-Mg matrix  has to be taken 
into account as well for any specimens consisting of both phases, particularly as deformation is bound 
to start in the softer metallic phase .  
Depending on the Ca/Al ratio and the temperature chosen for any annealing treatment , there can be 
three different types of Laves phases in Mg -Al-Ca alloys: CaAl 2 (C15), CaMg 2 (C14) or Ca (Mg,Al) 2 
(C36) phase [8, 14, 29- 32]. The C36 Laves phase is present in as-cast alloys with intermediate Ca/Al 
ratio (‚âà 0.6) and similar compositions like the one studied in this work [8 -11, 33, 34] .  
Although they are  macroscopically brittle at low temperatures, Laves phases have shown considerable 
plasticity in small scale mechanic al testing like micropillar compression [4, 7, 15, 35] . The size of Laves 
phase struts in conventional as- cast Mg -Al-Ca alloys is of the order of  1 ¬µm  or less ; close to the 
dimensions generally studied in micropillar compression testing.  
Here, our aim is to achieve insights into the co -deformation of the Mg matrix with two diff erent Laves 
phases under conditions close to those in a final, technologically useful microstructure. D ue to the 
intrinsic geometry of the Laves phase interfaces available from as- cast microstructures,  with their finer 
Laves precipitates, certain informati on will remain out of reach, e.g. an accurate interfacial shear 
strength or quantitative transmission stresses. However, even though the occurring phase 
transformations make the preparation of interfaces for dedicated mechanical testing a challenging 
endea vour, t his information may be studied separately in the future if straight interfaces can be achieved 
by appropriate heat treatment or solidification conditions.   
In this work, w e therefore set out to study the active deformation mechanisms and in particul ar co -
deformation  in a Laves phase reinforced Mg -Al-Ca alloy. For this, we considered four systematic sets 4 
 of conditions: (1) (micro)compression of the Œ± -Mg phase in different orientations to assess the 
behaviour of the matrix alloyed with Al and C a as a b aseline, (2) compression of micropillars containing 
Œ±-Mg/Laves phases interfaces with the C36 Laves phase from as -cast alloy or (3) Mg/C15 Laves phase 
interfaces from the same alloy in an annealed state and (4) compression of C15 Laves phase . Together, 
these allow us to directly compare the strengthening effect of the Laves phases on the Œ± -Mg matrix and 
assess the effects of the geometrical alignment of Laves phases on the co -deformation behaviour.  
 Experimental methods  
2.1 Sample preparation and microscopy  
The raw materials were m olten  in a steel crucible inside a  vacuum induction furnace under a protective 
atmosphere of Ar. The melt was solidified and cooled in a Cu mould inside the furnace under protective 
atmosphere. The chemical composition of the as- cast al loy was measured using wet chemical analysis 
to be  Mg-4.65Al -2.82Ca alloy. To increase the size of the intermetallic struts, a heat treatment of the 
as-cast alloy was carried out at 500 ¬∞C for 48 hrs in Ar atmosphere followed by cooling in air. This 
result ed not only in the coarsening of the intermetallic structure but also in the transformation from the 
C36 to the C15 phase. We refer to these two states as the as -cast and annealed conditions.  
Two specimens for micro structure  analysis and micropillar m illing were cut using electric discharge  
erosion from the as -cast block , one of which was subjected to  the heat treatment. The sample s were 
ground using 2000 and 4000 SiC  emery papers, followed by mechanical polishing using 3 and 1 ¬µm 
diamond suspension. To remove the deformation layer, the samples were subjected to electro- polishing 
using Struers AC -II electrolyte. The samples were etched for 60 s at ~- 20 ¬∞C and 15V. The electro -
polished surface was then subjected to mechanical polishing using Struers OPU (colloidal suspension 
of SiO 2 nano particles) for ~60 s to remove the waviness arising from electro -polishing of the dual phase 
material.  
Secondary electron (SE) imaging in scanning electron microscopes  (SEM, FEI Helios 600i  and Zeiss 
LEO1530) was used to analyse the microstructures. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in SEM was 5 
 used to determine the composition of  the Œ±-Mg matrix and the Laves phase. Electron backscatter 
diffraction (EBSD) was used to measure the crystallographic orientation s of the Œ±-Mg matrix. Due to 
the small size of the intermetallic Laves phase in the as -cast alloy , it was not possible to measure the 
orientation of the Laves phase. An accelerating v oltage of 10  kV was used for SE imaging and EDS 
while EBSD was done at 20 kV.  
Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) was done on the cross -section s of two selected micropillars 
(see section 2.2 ). For this purpose, the pillars‚Äô cross -sections were lifted out of the original sample and 
were placed on a TEM grid. They were thinned down to a thickness of ~300 nm using focussed ion 
beam (FIB) with currents ranging from 0.230 nA to 80 pA. A small current, i.e, 80pA, was used for the 
final polishing steps. TKD was performed on the cross -sections with a step size of 50 -60 nm at 30 kV 
and 5.5 nA. All EBSD data was analysed using OIM Analysis (EDAX).  
2.2 Microcompression  
Micropil lars of ~ 1.6‚Äì2 ¬µm diameter and ~  3.5‚Äì4.5 ¬µm height  were milled in matrix grains with different 
orientations, where the inclination of the  c-axis to the compression direction was varied from  0 to 90 ¬∞, 
using FIB  milling . Stress and strain calculations were performed using the actual dimensions of the 
pillars determined from SEM images. The top diameter of the pillars was used for stress calculation. 
The cylindrical pillars were milled using concentric circles with a decreasing ion beam curr ent from 9.3 
nA to 80 pA at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV. The pillar taper angle was less than 2¬∞ for  most pillars .  
The micropillars were compressed in two different load -controlled nanoindenters (iNano and InSEM 
III; Nanomechanics  Inc., USA ) at a loading rate of 0.05 mN/s and using a flat punch diamond indenter 
with a diameter  of 10 ¬µm. The Sneddon correction was applied to the depth data to minimise  the effect 
of elastic deformation of substrate and indenter  as discussed in [36]. The tests were stopped after a 
significant strain burst was observed in the load -depth curve. The slip systems were analysed using the 
code and method already presented in [37], after adjustment for the hexagonal Mg phase. The 
micropillars before and after deformation were imaged from three diff erent directions at a tilt angle of 
45 ¬∞.      6 
 
 Results  
3.1 Microstructural characterisation  
A typical SE image of the as -cast microstructure of cast Mg-4.65Al -2.82Ca is presented in Figure 1 (a). 
The Œ± -Mg matrix (grey colour) is reinforced with an interconnected intermetallic skeleton (white phase) 
shown at greater magnification in Figure 1 ( b). The grain size of the alloy is big when  compared to the 
areas bounded by the intermetallic struts ( Figure 1 (c)). The big grains enabled  milling of micropillars 
in each grain within  the Œ±-Mg matrix and at the Œ± -Mg/Laves phase interfaces. The determined 
composition of the intermetallic Laves phase and the Œ± -Mg matrix is presented in Figure 1 (d). Note 
that the solubility of Ca is very low and therefore not quantified here by means of EDS. The morphology 
and composition of the Laves phase suggest that it is the Ca (Mg,Al) 2 C36 phase. The C36 phase was 
also determined to be the main intermetallic phase in similar alloys studied previously [9 -11, 34] . This 
phase is also shown to contain small precipitates as highlighted by green arrows ( Figure 1 e). These 
precipitates may strengthen or toughen the C36 Laves phase  depending upon its composition. 
Moreover, there are intragranular needle -like CaAl 2 precipitates within  the Œ±-Mg matrix in line with the 
previous ly reported work on similar alloys [8, 11] .

magnified view of the orange rectangle .

 The microstructure of the heat -treated alloy contains the Œ± -Mg matrix and inter - and intragranular CaAl 2 
Laves phase precipitates ( Figure 2). The Ca Al2 phase precipitates were significantly different in sha pe 
compared wit h the C36 Laves phase present in as-cast alloy where they were present as round particles 
or thick platelets in comparison to thin interconnected struts in the as -cast alloy, Figure 2 (a and b). 
Moreover, the composition of the intermetallic phase drastically changed after heat treatment : in the as -
cast alloy the C36 Laves phase was observed, while in the heat -treated sample the CaAl2 phase was 
observed (Figure 2  c). The larger, rounder , and more homogeneously distributed Laves phase 
precipitates in the heat -treated alloy enabled us to determine the orientation of both phases. The Ca Al2 
Laves phase precipitates share no specific orientation relationship with the Œ± -Mg matrix (Figure 2  d and 
e). The area fraction of the Laves phase is reduced from ~  6.5 % in the as-cast state (determined from 
the micrograph shown in Figure 2 (a)) to ~  4.9 % in the heat -treated state (determined from the 
micrograph given in Figure 2 (b)) . This reduction in area fraction is assumed to occur  because the C36 
phase contains a significant amount of Mg while the C15 phase can accommodate only a much smaller 
amount of Mg in sol id solution [38] .

 3.2 Deformation of the Œ± -Mg phase  ‚Äì effect of c -axis orientation  
The micropillars were milled into Œ± -Mg grains with declination angles ( œï) between the compression 
axis and the c- axis of the Mg unit cell va rying from ~6 to ~89 ¬∞. As expected for Mg, the engineering 
stress- strain curves showed a strong dependence on the orientation (Figure 3  a). The yield st ress first 
decreased up to intermediate angles (see also Figure 3 a) and then increased again towards  89 ¬∞ ( Figure 
3 b). Basal slip was found to be the predominant deformation mechanism at the angles tested with œï  up 
to 55¬∞ (the next considered inclination was 77¬∞, all tested angles are shown in Figure 3 b). The slip 
system identification was confirmed by matching the deformed pillars with simulated pillars which 
were generated using the Matlab code and EBSD data as discussed in [37, 39] . For this purpose, the 
deformed  and simulated pillars were compared from three different sides and rotated clockwise at 
increments of 120 ¬∞ ( Figure 3  c). The deformation features in mi cropillars undergoing basal slip were 
very similar to the earlier reported cylindrical Mg micropillars oriented for basal slip [40 -42].

(œÉ0.2) with œï, (c): SE images of the side view taken at an angle of 45¬∞ to the surface normal of a 
deformed micropillar from three different directions and their comparison with simulated 
micropillars depicting the activation of basal slip,  
10 
 Extension twinning or a combination of extension twinning and basal slip (within the deformation twin) 
was observed when œï  was varied between 77 and 89 ¬∞  (Figure 4 ). In a few micropillars, only basal slip 
was also observed together with bending of the micropillars (one such example is shown in Figure 4 
(e)). A side and top view image of one deformed micropillar with the c -axis nearly perpendicular to the 
applied load is presented in Figure 4 (a) and ( b). As opposed to basal slip, it is not straight forward to 
confirm extension twinning in the deformed micropillars. We therefore used post -deformation 
orientation analysis by TKD to confirm the occurrence of twinning by lifting out a thin lamella. The 
position from where the lamella  was lifted out is highlighted by the white dotted rectangle in Figure 4 
(b). The IPF map of the deformed cross- section ( Figure 4 c and d) reveals that the entire micropillar has 
twinned and analysis of the misorientation angle between the undeformed matrix and the deformed 
pillar confirms that the twin is a {101ÔøΩ2} extens ion twin commonly observed in Mg.

has twinned, (e): side view of a micropillar which underwent basal slip even when the highest SF for 
basal slip was only 0.06 ( œï = 86¬∞) .  
3.3 Co-deformation of the Œ± -Mg(Al,Ca) and hexagonal C36 Laves phase  
In micropillars containing both phases in the as -cast alloy, i.e. Mg matrix and mainly C36 Laves phase, 
the Laves phase skeleton can delay  the onset of basal slip and twinning, but the effectiveness of this 
11 
 strengthening effect depends on the geometric ali gnment of intermetallic phase and the active 
deformation paths originating from the Mg matrix ( Figure 5 ).  
There is a significant increase in yield str ess when the Laves phase runs through the micropillar ( Figure 
5 a-c). The strengthening effect of the Laves phase was much weaker when the Laves phase was present 
only in a portion of the micropillar  (Figure 5  d-f) and therefore the entire pillar was able to deform on 
a continuous basal slip plane in  the Mg phase alone, even if this was further down the pillar. The small 
strengthening contribution was then presumably due to the slight radius increase along the pillar axis  
(Figure 5  f).  
Similarly, the yield stress of micropillars oriented for extension twinning also increased due to  the 
presence of the Laves pha se ((Figure 5  g-i). Specifically, œÉ0.2 increased from ~ 221 MPa for a pillar 
containing only Œ±-Mg ( Figure 5 h) to ~450 MPa for a pillar containing Laves phase and Œ± -Mg phase 
(Figure 5 i). 
Across all pillars tested, t he effect of the geometrical alignment of the two phases therefore  appears to 
be more important than  the volume fraction of Laves phase in the micropillar  with the complete 
obstruction of an easy deformation path inside the Mg matrix giving maximum strengthening and co-
deformation with plasticity in the C36 phas e or along an interface in the cases where the Mg phase 
cannot deform to give a through- thickness shape change of the pillar by itself.  
It can be further seen that the Laves phase present in the micropillar is not homogenous and single phase, but that the re are precipitates within the C36 Laves phase ( Figure 1 (e)). These precipitates were 
also observed in undeformed micropillars indicating that they were not generated during deformation.

depicted here are drawn schematically: (a -c) geometric alignment of Mg and C36 phase obstructing 
through- thickness deformation along the softer Mg phase in basal slip only; (d- f) deformation in case 
of continuous Mg deformation path by basal slip and (g- i) co -deformation in case of deformation 
dominated by extension twinning in the Mg matrix.  The scale bar (length of white line) represents a 
length of 1 ¬µm.   
 
3.4 Co-deformation of the Œ± -Mg and cubic C15 CaAl 2 Laves phase  
In contrast to the fine Mg/C36 composite in the as -cast material, the annealed state allowed the 
preparation of microp illars consisting entirely of either Mg or CaAl 2 Laves phase as well as a 
combination of the two. A direct comparison ( Figure 6) between monolithic and two-phase pillars 
milled in adjacent grains of the two phases and at their interface, respectively, gave a much higher yield 
13 
 stress for the CaAl 2 phase (œÉ 0.2 ~2956 MPa) compared with the Œ±-Mg matrix (œÉ 0.2 ~132 MPa) and an 
intermediate value for a  pillar at  the Mg/Ca Al2 interface.

Mg phase, Œ± -Mg/CaAl 2 interface , and CaAl 2 phase. (b), (c), and (d) are the micrographs of 
micropillars containing Œ± -Mg phase, Œ± -Mg/CaAl 2, and CaAl 2 phase , respectively. Both (b) and (c) 
were milled in to the same Mg grain  which has high Schmid factor for basal slip. (e) Engineering

correspond to the respective stress- strain curves. The w hite arrow in ( g) highlights the point of slip 
transfer from Mg to CaAl 2. Scale bar represent the length of 1¬µm.   
 
Only a single case of slip transfer visible at the micropilla r surface was observed ( Figure 6 (g)), although 
it could not be characterised in more detail due to its position at the very bottom of the micropillar. 
Again, the pillars showed very little str engthening where a continuous path through the Mg matrix 
existed ( Figure 6 (h) and corresponding stress strain curve) and an intermediate value where the CaAl 2 
phase could not be circumvented easily.

 Discussion 
4.1 Deformation of the Œ± -Mg(Al, Ca) phase  
We found that the Mg matrix phase contained about 1.2 % Al and a small amount of Ca below the limit 
of quantitative detection by EDS. This is consistent with expecta tions based on the solubility of the two 
elements  [14]. In addition, we found precipitates of CaAl 2, presumably, parallel to the basal plane which 
have been described before [8, 11, 12] . In the light of these features, we set out to characterise the 
orientation dependence of flow in the Œ± -Mg p hase in terms of the dominant deformation mechanism 
(dislocation slip or twinning) and the associated critical resolved shear stresses.  
We observed the expected anisotropy (see Figure 3 (a) and (b)) with the yield stress increasing as the 
inclination angle  of the  c-axis towards the compression direction tilts from 0¬∞ towards  90¬∞. This is 
because the Schmid factor, m S, for bas al slip is reduced and higher stresses are required to reach the 
ùúèùúèùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂  for basal slip. Further, it can be seen i n Figure 3  (a) that the pillar with  an inclination angle of œï 
~ 6 ¬∞ (black curve), exhibited no significant strain bursts in the stress -strain curve, but showed a rather 
continuous transition from the elastic to the plastic region and a higher strain hardening. The highest 
Schmid factor for  basal slip in this pillar was ~0.09, but even then, some basal slip traces were observed 
on the surface of a deformed micro -pillar. The s trong work hardening in such a pillar  likely  reflects 
simultaneous activation of non- basal (pyramidal) slip systems, which is usually associated with pillars 
milled in orientations with œï approaching 0¬∞ [43] . The ùúèùúè ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ for basal slip was measured as 58 ¬± 19 
MPa, in good agreement with the earlier reported values of ~ 51 MPa  by Wang et al. [26]  for 
micropillars o f similar geometry and size  in Mg5%Zn alloy. A mo re detailed comparison of the CRSS 
for basal slip with values reported in the literature is presented in  Figure 7. These values are well above 
those observed in macroscopic tests [16, 17]  due to the well- known size effec t [40-42, 44- 46]. The size 
effect occurs because of the small number of dislocations sources and the truncation of  the moving 
dislocation arms  associated with the small volume and/or with the scarcity of mobile dislocations [27, 
40].  15 
  
Figure 7: Comparison of CRSS values for basal slip observed  in this work and reported in  existing 
literature.  
 
In the yield stress values of micropillars which were present in grains with œï  ‚â• 77 ¬∞ ( Figure 3), i.e. away 
from those  orientations where the measured yield stress can confidently be associated with basal slip, 
the experimental scatter increased significantly . The œÉ 0.2 for these orientations was  240 ¬± 90 MPa. A 
relatively large scatter for a similar orientation was also o bserved by Wang et al. [26] in Mg5% Zn and 
by Wang et al. [27]  in a Mg-0.2Ca -1.8Zn alloy . They [27]  related the observed scatter to the initial 
misalignment between the indenter and the micropillar surface as twin nucleation is very sensitive to 
localised stresses. We did not try to calculate the CRSS for twinning from the present data as the 
presence of a defor mation twin can only be confirmed via lift out and additional characterisation by 
EBSD, TKD or TEM of each pillar . Nonetheless, we did confirm twinning by TKD of a cross -section 
of one micropillar and twin -like (lenticular) features were visible in many of  the deformed micropillars 
oriented similarly for extension twinning. E xtension twinning was also observed in similar orientations 
in micropillar compression of pure Mg and its alloys in several recent studies [27, 28, 43, 47- 52]. In 
summary, the observations on the Œ± -Mg micropillars compressed along different orientations conforms 
entirely with expectations for pillars of the given size and is consistent with reports on 
microcompression testing in other Mg alloys .

 4.2 Deformation of the Laves phases  
Laves phases (C15, C14 or C36) have a high strength compared to the Œ± -Mg matrix . While to the best 
of our knowledge no data exists for the Ca(Mg,Al) 2 C36 phase alone, due to the difficulty of 
synthesising bulk specimens of sufficient size, we measured here a yield stress of nearly 3 GPa for the 
CaAl 2 phase.  This value is within the same range as the values reported by Freund et al. [15] in their 
work  on CaAl 2. Using micropillars of a similar diameter of  ‚âà 2 ¬µm , the CRSS for basal slip in the 
CaMg 2 Laves phase has been  measured as ‚âà 520 MPa [4]. A consistent difference in the micro hardness 
of CaAl2 and CaMg 2 was reported by Rokhlin et al [5] . The difference between the hardness of the 
CaMg 2 and CaAl 2 phases is evident in a  comparison of work by Zehnder et al. [4] and Freund et al. 
[15]. Zehnder et al. [4] reported a hardness of ‚âà  3.4 ¬± 0.2 GPa for CaMg 2, while Freund et al. [15] 
reported a hardness of 4.9 ¬± 0.7 GPa for the CaAl 2 phase, both at room temperature . We would expect 
the CRSS values for the C36 Laves phases to be  within the range of values reported for the  C14 and 
C15 Laves phases. In our case, we change the B element from pure Mg (C14) to a mixture of Mg and 
Al (C36) to pure Al (C15) , however, i n the binary Nb -Co system,  all three Laves phases exist as NbCo 2 
and no significant dependence on the crystal structure was found in indentation across a diffusion couple 
containing all three phases  [53, 54] .  
In principle , we would therefore expect all three Laves phases to act as efficient strengthening phases 
and this is in fact what we observed in all micropillars containing both phases  (Œ±-Mg and Laves phase) . 
Using the image of  simple comp osite deformation, the micropillar strength is determined by the way 
the two phases are arranged geometrically, with an efficient strengthening only achieved where deformation along the ‚Äòweakest link‚Äô of a continuous soft phase with a suitable deformation path (basal 
slip in Mg) is prevented ( Figure 5 -  Figure 6).  
4.3 (Co)-Deformation and reinforcement potential in bulk alloys  
Following the characterisation of the Mg(Al, Ca) matrix phase‚Äôs deformation and the co- deformation 
of pillars containing either C15 or C36 Laves phase, w e focus her e on the strengthening potential of 
these phases within a dual phase microstructure . In this context, the two most important aspects to 17 
 consider are: (1) Can strengthening be achieved in such a way that the matrix is shielded from excessive 
stresses,  but plastic co -deformation is enabled at stress concentrations to prevent early failure? (2) Can 
the desired phase be easily obtained in a morphology that allows effective stress transfer to the 
reinforcement phase?  
To address the first question on whether plas tic co -deformation is likely, we searched the surfaces of 
deformed micropillars from two -phase specimens for signs of co -deformation. In case of co -
deformation of Mg and the C15 phase, no indications of plasticity traversing from the Mg into the Laves 
phase were found, with the one potential but unclear exception shown in Figure 6 (g). Several examples 
of two-phase  pillars containing Mg and the C15 phase before and after deformation are shown in Figure 
8. While significant plasticity was introduced overall in many cases,  the strain appears to have been 
accommodated solely in the Mg phase and at the interfaces between Mg and the C15 Laves phase.  
 
 
Figure 8: Micropillars before and after deformation containing both the Mg and CaAl 2 C15 Laves 
phases . Deformation is constrained to the Mg phase and its interface with the Laves phase, but no 
indication of plasticity crossing the interface was found. The scale bars in the figure represent a 
length of 1¬µm.  
 
In a micropillar s containing Mg and the hexagonal C36 phase, the post -mortem observations revealed 
slight differences ( Figure 9 ). In this case, several pillars exhibited  surfaces slip traces in both phases 
with again the majority of deformation achieved in the Mg phase, but clear indications of plasticity in 
18 
 the C36 phase as well. Four instances of plasticity in the C36 phase are shown at higher magnification 
in Figure 9 along with the micropillar viewed as a whole. In these cases, localised slip in the Mg phase 
appears to either have continued through smaller C36 phase  particles ( Figure 9 a and d) or the high 
stresses resulting from deformation of the surrounding volume led to the nucleation and/or motion of 
disloca tion in the C36 phase directly, as may have been the case in the micropillars displayed in Figure 
9 b and c.  
 
Figure 9: Micropillars demonstrating co -deformation of Œ± -Mg/C36 Laves phase micropillars. 
Orange arrows in (b), (c), (e) and (f) demonstrate the instances where slip transfer occurred into the 
Laves phase or/and where the Laves phase has undergone plastic deformat ion. (b) and (e) are 
magnified images  of the areas bounded by blue rectangles in (a) and (d) respectively.  
 
As the phase distribution could not be exactly controlled, we cannot reach a definite conclusion based 
on this data, but it appears likely that co- deformation with the C15 phase is much more difficult, as 
otherwise similar morphologies (e.g. Figure 8 d-e and F igure 9 b-d) should also result in visible co-
deformation.  
While the C15 is harder, it also potentially offers a higher number of slip planes that may align with the 
dominant (basal) slip s ystem in the Mg matrix. Indeed, an initially advantageous alignment of Mg(0002) 
// C15(111) has been identified for the initial stages of precipitation [14] , but the interfaces from which 
19 
 we were able to cut two - and single phase micropillars ( Figure 2 ) possess no common orientation 
relationship. For the C36 phase , we previously determined an orientation relationship 
‚à†[0001] Mg,[0001] C36 = 82 ¬∞ ¬± 10 ¬∞ and encountered several C36 particles wi th a c -plane parallel to 
Mg(11ÔøΩ01) in several TEM lamellae [6, 10, 14] , while Luo et al. [34]  found an orientation relationship 
with almost parallel basal planes between the two phases. The C36 Laves phase tends to deform via 
basal slip [6, 10]  and is therefore able to accommodate plasticity on the Mg basal plane directly on its 
basal plane. Or following dislocation storag e at the interface with the resulting non -basal dislocations 
in the Mg phase inducing basal slip in the Laves at a near 90¬∞ angle might occur , as proposed in [6]  
based on observations of plastic co -deformation in bulk composites with a C36 skeleton. The closely 
related C14 phase possesses a low CRSS  for prismatic slip  [4], but whether this is also an easy slip 
system in the C36 phase, with its changed stacking along the c -axis, is not known.  
We therefore conclude that in spite of the potential of the CaAl 2 phase as a more isotropic cubic phase, 
its reinforcemen t potential for Mg -Al-Ca composite alloys is probably limited. In addition to the even 
more severely restricted co -deformation and therefore presumably limited bulk ductility, the CaAl 2 
phase has not been observed in a useful morphology for load transfer. This is because the skeleton -like 
morphology is promoted with increasing Ca/Al ratio [8]  and the Ca Al2 phase only appears at low Ca/Al 
ratios [30]. While the C36 and C14 phases form a skeleton in which strut thickness and connectivity 
can then be tuned by solidification rate and alloy content, respectively, the C15 phase precipi tates 
nucleate as particles oriented along the basal plane , but these grow to globular particles. Neither 
characteristic, the initial alignment with the basal plane (rather than perpendicular to it to inhibit basal 
flow in the Mg matrix) nor the globular s hape (allowing easy circumvention on parallel slip planes) 
provide a promising path to a microstructure in which the Mg matrix experiences shielding from an 
applied load. This is of particular importance under the creep conditions envisaged for these alloy s, 
even if some (work) hardening has in fact been successfully achieved with these CaAl 2 microstructures 
[14, 55] . However, if a transformation path to C15 is found in which a skeleton reinforcement is 
achieved without or only slow further transformation to globular particles, then the phase would be a 20 
 plausible candidate for reinforcement where phase stability to high temperature s well beyond 200 ¬∞C 
was of greater importance than the potential for limited co -deformation.  
 Conclusions   
We investigated the deformation and co -deformation of  a Œ±-Mg(Al,Ca) solid solution matrix with small 
precipitates deformed along different crystal orientations and its co -deformation with the cubic CaAl 2 
C15 and hexagonal Ca(Mg,Al) 2 C36 Laves phases in order to assess the relative potential of the two 
Laves phases for in -situ reinforcement of bulk alloys. Our findings  and conclusions include:  
1. The CRSS for basal slip in ‚âà 2 ¬µm Œ± -Mg(Al,Ca)  micropillars  at 58 ¬± 19 MPa  corresponds 
closely to that of related alloys  and twinning is introduced where the compression direction 
approaches the orientation of the basal plane.  
2. Both , the C36 and C15 Laves phases delay the onset of basal slip in the Œ± -Mg phase and also 
provide significant strengthening where the Mg phase is oriented for extension twinning.  
3.  Although both Laves phases are clearly hard and brittle, the C36 phase showed several 
instances of clea r co-deformation, while the C15 phase did not.  
4. Overall, the C36 phase appears the more promising candidate for further alloy design in spite 
of its lower melting point, high temperature s tability and hardness, as it  offers superior co -
deformation and a tuneable skeleton morphology to achieve load shielding under creep conditions for the Mg matrix.
