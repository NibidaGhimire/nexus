ABSTRACT
While the shape of the Ly αprofile is viewed as one of the best tracers of ionizing-photon escape
fraction ( fesc) within low redshift ( z∼0.3) surveys of the Lyman continuum, this connection remains
untested at high redshift. Here, we combine deep, rest-UV Keck/LRIS spectra of 80 objects from
the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic Survey with rest-optical Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy in
order to examine potential correlations between Ly αprofile shape and the escape of ionizing radiation
within z∼3 star-forming galaxies. We measure the velocity separation between double-peaked Ly α
emission structure (v sep), between red-side Ly αemission peaks and systemic (v Lyα,red), and between
red-side emission peaks and low-ionization interstellar absorption lines (v Lyα−LIS). We find that the
IGM-corrected ratio of ionizing to non-ionizing flux density is significantly higher in KLCS objects
with lower v Lyα,red. We find no significant trend between measures of ionizing-photon escape and
vLyα−LIS. We compare our results to measurements of z∼0.3 “Green Peas” from the literature and
find that KLCS objects have larger v sepat fixed v Lyα,red, larger fescat fixed v Lyα,red, and higher
vLyα,redoverall than z∼0.3 analogs. We conclude that the Ly αprofile shapes of our high-redshift
sources are fundamentally different, and that measurements of profile shape such as v Lyα,redmap on
tofescin different ways. We caution against building reionization-era fescdiagnostics based purely on
Lyαprofiles of low-redshift dwarf galaxies. Tracing v sep, vLyα,red, and fescin a larger sample of z∼3
galaxies will reveal how these variables may be connected for galaxies at the epoch of reionization.

1.INTRODUCTION
Cosmic reionization represents a significant milestone
in the evolution of the Universe, in which Hydrogen in
the intergalactic medium (IGM) transitioned from neu-
tral to ionized. Based on the emergent UV spectrum
of distant quasars, reionization is thought to end at
z∼5.5−6 (Fan et al. 2006; Becker et al. 2021). While
there are multiple constraints on the timeline of reion-
ization, the relative contribution of ionizing light from
astronomical sources, and thus the chief drivers of this
process, remain in debate. Some works have shown that
star-forming galaxies provide the majority of the ioniz-
ing emissivity at z≳6, considering quasars have rela-
∗Carnegie Fellowtively small number densities during reionization (Inoue
et al. 2006; Jiang et al. 2016; Parsa et al. 2018), but
which population of star-forming galaxies are most crit-
ical to reionization, and the detailed physics of ionizing
photon production and escape, remain unsettled ques-
tions (e.g., Finkelstein et al. 2019; Naidu et al. 2020).
In order to constrain the evolving ionizing emissivity
in the Universe, we can parameterize the quantity us-
ing three variables: the cosmic star-formation rate den-
sity (commonly measured as the UV luminosity density
ρUV), the ionizing photon production efficiency ξion, and
the escape fraction of ionizing photons fesc(Robertson
et al. 2015). With the advent of the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST ), high-quality near-IR observations
have been acquired for a large number of reionization-
era galaxies, which has led to improved constraints onarXiv:2401.09526v1  [astro-ph.GA]  17 Jan 20242 Pahl et al.
both ρUV(e.g., Finkelstein & Bagley 2022; Donnan et al.
2023; Harikane et al. 2023) and ξion(e.g., Tang et al.
2023) out to z∼9−12. The gradual decline in ρUVand
the elevated ξionat higher redshifts seen in early JWST
surveys appear to indicate that sufficient ionizing pho-
tons are produced in star-forming galaxies to drive reion-
ization, but only those that escape their source galaxies
will ultimately affect the ionization state of the IGM.
Determining fescdirectly from photometric or spectro-
scopic surveys is virtually impossible for reionization-era
sources, even with JWST , as the transmission of Ly-
man continuum (LyC) photons through the marginally-
neutral IGM drops off precipitously past z∼4 (Vanzella
et al. 2012). Thus, significant observational effort has
been expended to understand the average ionizing sig-
nal from different populations of galaxies at lower red-
shifts, and uncovering indirect tracers of fescfor use
atz≳6 when reionization is in progress. These ef-
forts include surveys at z∼0.3 using the Cosmic
Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST /COS), where observations of LyC-leaking, com-
pact, star-forming galaxies (“Green Peas”) act as pur-
ported analogs to high-redshift sources (e.g., Izotov et al.
2016b, 2018b, 2021). Further success has been found by
including extreme optical emission-line ratios or blue UV
slopes as selection criteria, thus probing a wider range
of parameter space (Flury et al. 2022a). Closer to the
epoch of reionization at z∼3−4, the transmission of
the LyC through single IGM sightlines is inherently un-
certain, making fescconstraints for individual galaxies
indeterminate. Thus, statistical samples must be uti-
lized, as the average transmission across many sight-
lines can be precisely constrained. Both photometric
surveys of LyC, such as those using HST /WFC3 (e.g.,
Fletcher et al. 2019; Begley et al. 2022), and those us-
ing deep, rest-UV spectroscopic measurements (Marchi
et al. 2017, 2018; Steidel et al. 2018; Pahl et al. 2021)
have presented a consensus: ∼L∗star-forming galaxies
have an average fescof 5−10% at z∼3−4.
Within these surveys, the Ly αspectral feature ap-
pears to be a remarkably successful indicator of escap-
ing ionizing light. Direct correlations have been found
between fescand the equivalent width of Ly αatz∼3
(Marchi et al. 2018; Steidel et al. 2018; Pahl et al. 2021).
In“down the barrel”observations, both LyC and the res-
onant Ly αphotons will be attenuated by neutral-phase
gas in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM
and CGM, respectively), intertwining the fate of these
photons. At lower redshift, the shape of the emergent
Lyαprofile has been demonstrated to strongly predict
LyC leakage. When Ly αfeatures double-peaked struc-
ture, the velocity separation of these peaks is inverselycorrelated with fesc. This correlation is the tightest ob-
served between galaxy properties (e.g., O 32, M∗) and
fesc(Izotov et al. 2018b, 2021). In models where neutral
gas is distributed in a spherical shell around a galaxy,
shells with lower column densities result in smaller peak
separation of Ly α, explaining the connection to fesc
(Verhamme et al. 2015; Orlitov´ a et al. 2018). The dis-
tribution of neutral gas around star-forming galaxies is
likely more complex and clumpy, with some regions be-
ing entirely opaque and some and transparent to LyC
photons (Rudie et al. 2013; Reddy et al. 2016b; Stei-
del et al. 2018). A complete theoretical and empirical
understanding of the neutral-phase ISM and CGM, par-
ticularly how they affect emergent Ly αand LyC across
redshift, remains incomplete.
Using the promising results found at z∼0.3, infer-
ences have been made about escape fractions of galaxies
atz≳2 with high-resolution spectroscopy of Ly α. In
Naidu et al. (2022), the authors used the Ly αprofile
shapes of a sample of 35 z∼2 Lyαemitters (LAEs)
observed with X-SHOOTER to infer their escape frac-
tions. In Matthee et al. (2022), the authors extended
their framework to construct a model of reionization
that progresses rapidly and ends late, and is primar-
ily driven by LAEs. These two works are built upon the
connection between Ly αprofile shape and LyC escape,
which remains untested beyond z∼0.3. The z∼2
galaxies within the X-SHOOTER survey did not have
LyC measurements necessary to directly constrain fesc,
and thus definitively establish if fesc-vseprelationships
are invariant with redshift.
The Keck Lyman Continuum Survey (KLCS) repre-
sents an ideal opportunity for directly constraining the
connection between fescand Ly αprofile shape at the
highest redshifts possible (Steidel et al. 2018). The spec-
troscopic sample, which covers the LyC wavelength re-
gion, is both deep and has been cleaned from foreground
contamination (Pahl et al. 2021), which is a significant
concern plaguing LyC surveys at z∼2−4 (Vanzella
et al. 2012). Given the relatively low resolution of the
Keck/LRIS spectra in the KLCS ( R∼1300), double
peaked profiles are not reliably recovered at low velocity
separations. Other probes of Ly αkinematics are more
robust to lower resolution, such as the peak velocity off-
set from systemic, and are measurable for a significant
subset of the KLCS. This measurement is correlated
with v sepin low-redshift samples and is more readily
observed at z≳6 when the blue side of Ly αis entirely
attenuated by the neutral-phase IGM. Other spectral
features that trace the velocity structure of the ISM and
CGM of the galaxies, such as low-ionization metal ab-
sorption lines, are also recoverable given the depth ofLyαprofile shape and fesc 3
the Keck/LRIS observations. A detailed analysis of the
shape of Ly αprofiles in the KLCS is therefore of great
value to understanding whether the mechanisms of LyC
escape are consistent across redshift, and for testing how
the shape of Ly αcorrelates with fescat high redshift be-
fore Ly α-based fescdiagnostics are applied to galaxies in
the epoch of reionization. This work serves as an exten-
sion to the discussion of Ly αemission-line kinematics in
the KLCS presented in Steidel et al. (2018), and features
analyses of Ly αprofiles of individual galaxies, explicit
stacks as a function of Ly αprofile shape, and compari-
son to recent low- and high-redshift surveys of galaxies
with Ly αin emission.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we de-
scribe the KLCS sample and follow-up observations, lay
out the methodology for making quantitative measure-
ments of Ly αprofile shapes, and review our spectral-
stacking and fitting techniques. In Section 3, we present
the Ly αmeasurements of the KLCS and the modeled
fescof composite spectra binned across such measure-
ments. In Section 4, we discuss the applicability of our
results for reionization-era observations, and compare to
findings to those at low redshift and the fescassumptions
that have been applied to z∼2 and beyond. In Section
5, we summarize the main results of this work.
Throughout this paper, we adopt a standard ΛCDM
cosmology with Ω m= 0.3, Ω Λ= 0.7 and H0= 70
km s−1Mpc−1. The fescvalues reported in this paper
are absolute escape fractions, equivalent to fesc,absin
Steidel et al. (2018), and defined as the fraction of all
H-ionizing photons produced within a galaxy that es-
capes into the IGM. We also employ the AB magnitude
system (Oke & Gunn 1983).
2.SAMPLE AND METHODOLOGY
In order to understand the connection between Ly α
profile shape and escaping ionizing radiation from galax-
ies at high redshift, we require both spectroscopy of Ly α
with sufficient resolution to discern its structure and
measurements of the Lyman Continuum (LyC) region
to constrain fesc. These analyses must be applied to
statistical samples with adequate numbers of galaxies
that allow for binning as a function of a given mea-
surement of the Ly αprofile, given the uncertain cor-
rection of the IGM on individual LyC flux density mea-
surements. The galaxies in the KLCS have deep rest-
UV spectroscopy that covers both Ly αand the LyC, as
well as low-ionization interstellar absorption that probes
outflowing gas in the ISM+CGM, and rest-optical spec-
troscopy covering nebular emission lines useful for de-
termining systemic redshifts. In this section, we sum-
marize the observations available for the KLCS sampleand describe our measurements that quantify kinematic
information contained within the Ly αprofiles of KLCS
Lyαemitters.
2.1. Uncontaminated KLCS
The KLCS is a deep, spectroscopic exploration of
the escaping ionizing signal from a sample of 136 star-
forming, Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z∼3. The
survey was conducted using the Low Resolution Imag-
ing Spectrometer (LRIS, Oke et al. 1995; Steidel et al.
2004) on the Keck I telescope from 2006 to 2008. Each of
the objects in the nine survey fields were observed for an
average of 9 hours in order to sensitively probe the LyC
spectral region. After removing objects with clear spec-
troscopic blends and instrumental defects, the final sam-
ple of 124 galaxies was presented in Steidel et al. (2018).
Included in this parent sample were 15 galaxies individu-
ally detected in LyC, defined as f900>3σ900, where f900
is the average flux density 880 ≤λ0/˚A≤910 and σ900is
thef900measurement uncertainty. Measurements of the
LyC at high redshift require careful consideration of con-
tamination from foreground sources, which can signifi-
cantly bias average LyC fluxes. High-resolution imaging
is necessary for resolving and analyzing foreground ob-
jects (Vanzella et al. 2012; Mostardi et al. 2015). The
KLCS was the subject of a follow up by the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST ) in order to explore this contamination.
Using V606J125H160imaging, we selected contaminates
on the basis of their colors and removed them from the
sample, reducing the sample size to 120 (with 13 individ-
ually detected in LyC) and reporting a revised average
fescof 0.06±0.01 for the KLCS (Pahl et al. 2021).
In addition to deep, rest-UV LRIS spectroscopy and
HST imaging, a wealth of ancillary data is available for
the objects in the KLCS. Both ground-based and space-
based photometry were analyzed in tandem with spec-
tral stacking in order to explore fescand galaxy prop-
erties in Pahl et al. (2023). These properties, including
stellar mass (M ∗), star-formation rate (SFR), E(B-V),
and stellar age, were measured using stellar-population
synthesis (SPS) models for 96 KLCS objects. We recov-
ered inverse trends between fescand M ∗as well as fesc
and E(B-V), and no significant trends between fescand
stellar mass or specific star-formation rate (sSFR).
2.2. Redshift measurements and velocity analysis
Of the galaxies within the uncontaminated KLCS, 80
have Ly αprofiles such that a redshift can be estimated
from at least one peak of emission. Here, we analyze
the number and position of peaks within the Ly αpro-
files of these 80 objects. We quantify the position of the
peaks relative to systemic redshifts, which are based on4 Pahl et al.
rest-optical nebular emission lines, and low-ionization
interstellar absorption redshifts. The velocity separa-
tions that we endeavor to measure, which include the
Lyαpeak separation ( vsep), the separation between the
red-side Ly αpeak and the systemic redshift (v Lyα,red),
and the separation between the red-side Ly αpeak and
the low-ionization interstellar redshift (v Lyα−LIS), are
illustrated for a KLCS galaxy in Figure 1 as a demon-
stration of our methodology.
2.2.1. Lyαemission peaks
The velocity separation of the blue- and red-side
peaks of Ly αemission (v sep) has been demonstrated to
strongly correlate with fescat low redshift (Verhamme
et al. 2015; Izotov et al. 2018b), indicating that v sep
increases with optical depth in Ly α, Hicolumn den-
sity, and/or neutral-gas covering fraction. Of the 80
KLCS objects with Ly αemission, 24 have visual evi-
dence of double-peak structure within their 1D spectra.
These Ly αprofiles were typically red-side dominated:
we show the spectrum of a KLCS object (Q0100-C16)
with double-peaked structure as an example in Figure
1. Of these 24 objects, we identified 15 with sufficiently-
resolved blue-side peaks, such that the wavelength of
peak emission could be estimated for both sides of the
bimodal emission profile. In order to make an estimate
the peak wavelength for the blue-side emission, we first
fit a Gaussian profile and defined a window that lies
within 1 σof the central wavelength. We then deter-
mined λLyα,blue, which corresponded to the wavelength
in which maximum flux occurred within this window.
This procedure ensured that any asymmetries within the
blue-side profile were accounted for. We defined the red-
shift of the peak of blue-side Ly αemission as:
zLyα,blue=λLyα,blue
1215.67−1. (1)
We determined the redshift corresponding to the peak
of red-side Ly αemission in an identical manner to that
of the blue side, save for four objects. For these four pro-
files, the Ly αemission was either broad or noisy, and did
not have a well-defined maximum flux density. We thus
calculated zLyα,redusing simply the central wavelength
of the fitted profile.
We define zLyα,redas
zLyα,red=λLyα,red
1215.67−1, (2)
where λLyα,redis either the wavelength corresponding to
the maximum flux within 1 σof the central wavelength
of the best-fit Gaussian, or the central wavelength itself.
In Figure 1, we display zLyα,redfor Q0100-C16 as a red,dashed line and zLyα,blueas a blue, dashed line. We note
that we measured only one Ly αredshift for the major-
ity (65/80) of the KLCS objects, considering these had
no resolved double-peaked structure. We define these
singular redshifts as zLyα,redfor simplicity, but add no
requirement that these peaks be necessarily redshifted.
We estimated the errors on both zLyα,redandzLyα,blue
measurements in a similar fashion. After fitting a Gaus-
sian to a given profile to determine the window in which
the peak flux would be computed, we perturbed the ob-
served spectrum according to the error spectrum. Each
flux density value at a given wavelength was randomly
modulated according to a Gaussian with zero mean and
width equal to the corresponding error spectrum value.
From this perturbed spectrum, we recorded the wave-
length corresponding to the maximum flux within 1 σof
the central wavelength of the initial best-fit Gaussian.
Each spectrum was perturbed 100 times in this man-
ner, resulting in 100 zLyα,red(zLyα,blue) measurements
for each object. The final zLyα,red(zLyα,blue) estimate
was taken as the mean of these 100 values, with the
error on zLyα,red(zLyα,blue) taken as the standard devi-
ation of the 100 values. For the four objects in which
λLyα,redwas estimated from the best-fit Gaussian alone,
we performed a similar procedure, but instead re-fit the
Gaussian using the perturbed spectrum, resulting in 100
values for zLyα,redestimated from the central wavelength
of each best-fit Gaussian.
2.2.2. Systemic redshifts
We determined the systemic redshift ( zsys) from rest-
optical nebular emission lines. From our parent sample
of 80 objects with Ly αemission, 45 objects have either
[Oiii]λλ4959,5007, [O ii]λλ3726,3729 or H βemission in
existing Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy. We fit Gaussian
profiles to these lines, and used the central wavelength
of well-fit profiles to calculate the object’s systemic red-
shift. If multiple of these lines were recovered in the
rest-optical spectrum, we estimated zsysby averaging
the redshifts implied by each line measurement. The
nebular redshift for Q1009-C16 is presented as a dotted,
purple line in Figure 1. Given the strength and nar-
row width of the nebular emission lines in these objects,
in addition to the higher spectral resolution and SNR
of the Keck/MOSFIRE spectra, we consider the error
onzsysnegligible compared to redshifts measured from
Keck/LRIS.
2.2.3. Low-ionization absorption redshifts
The wavelength position of interstellar metal absorp-
tion lines traces the velocity of low-ionization material
in the ISM/CGM, which tends to be negative (out-
flowing) at these redshifts (Shapley et al. 2003; SteidelLyαprofile shape and fesc 5

emission lines. Right panel: Three low-ionization metal absorption lines detected in Q1009-C16, which are used to determine

et al. 2010; Jones et al. 2012; Du et al. 2018). We de-
termined the low-ionization absorption redshift by us-
ing the same Keck/LRIS spectra used for Ly αanal-
ysis, as the spectral coverage extends to ∼1600˚A in
the rest frame. The strongest low-ionization absorp-
tion features in these spectra were typically Si iiλ1260,
Oiλ1302+Si iiλ1304, and C iiλ1334. We estimated
zLISby fitting Gaussian profiles to these three lines,
and averaging the redshifts calculated from the cen-
tral wavelengths of well-constrained Gaussian fits. For
Oiλ1302+Si iiλ1304, which is blended at the resolu-
tion of our spectra, we assumed a singular wavelength
of 1302.5 ˚A. In the right panel of Figure 1, we display
Siiiλ1260, O iλ1302+Si iiλ1304, and C iiλ1334 for
Q1009-C16. The zLISmeasured from these three lines is
displayed as a green, dash-dot line. The same redshift
is also displayed in the left panel, showing its position
relative to Ly α.
We estimated the errors on zLISempirically, again
by using the Keck/LRIS error spectra. We performed
Monte Carlo simulations by perturbed each flux density
value by a Gaussian with zero mean and width equal
to the value of the error spectrum at the correspond-
ing wavelength. We then re-fit Gaussian profiles to each
line using this perturbed spectrum, and re-calculatedzLIS. For each object, we performed this perturbation
100 times, and measure 100 values for zLIS. The sub-
sequent zLISmeasurement and error was determined as
the mean and standard deviation of these 100 values.
2.2.4. Velocities
Different kinematic measurements are possible for
subsets of the KLCS, depending on which spectral fea-
tures were detected. For the objects for which we mea-
sured zLyα,blue,zLyα,red, and zsys, we define the separa-
tion between the blue- and red-side Ly αpeak as
vsep=c×zLyα,red−zLyα,blue
1 +zsys. (3)
For objects with only zLyα,blueandzLyα,red, we use an
average of zLyα,blueandzLyα,redrather than zsysto de-
fine relative velocities:
vsep=c×zLyα,red−zLyα,blue
1 + (zLyα,red+zLyα,blue)/2. (4)
We defined the KLCS sepsample as the 15 objects with
this measurement. Of these 15, only one is individually-
detected in LyC.
While v sephas been demonstrated to be an fescdiag-
nostic in low-redshift ( z∼0.3) LyC surveys, its observ-
ability becomes increasingly difficult at higher redshifts6 Pahl et al.
as the blue-side peak becomes attenuated by the neutral-
phase IGM. We introduce v Lyα,redas the velocity sepa-
ration between the red-side Ly αpeak and systemic red-
shift, as a v sep-like quantity more readily measured both
in the KLCS and in reionization-era galaxies. We mea-
sured this quantity for the galaxies with zLyα,redandzsys
as
vLyα,red=c×zLyα,red−zsys
1 +zsys, (5)
and defined the KLCS Lyα,redsample as the 45 ob-
jects with this measurement. Eight of the objects
within KLCS Lyα,redare LyC detections. We lack
Keck/MOSFIRE observations of the full KLCS, as ob-
jects at 2 .75≲z≲2.95 lack strong nebular lines in
atmospheric windows. We therefore investigate the ve-
locity separation of zLyα,redandzLIS, which contrasts
the position of Ly αto the velocities of neutral ISM. We
define this quantity as
vLyα−LIS=c×zLyα,red−zLIS
1 + (zLyα,red+zLIS)/2, (6)
and defined the KLCS Lyα−LISsample as the 67 objects
with both Ly αemission and LIS absorption redshifts
measured. This sample includes six of the 13 LyC de-
tections in the full KLCS. We overlay v sep, vLyα,red,
vLyα−LISon the Ly αprofile of Q1009-C16 in Figure 1.
Due to its complete suite of redshifts measurements, this
object was included in all three KLCS subsamples.
We summarize the combination of detected emission
lines required for each of the three KLCS subsam-
ples, including their resulting sample sizes, in Table
1. We additionally display sample statistics of the full
KLCS alongside the three KLCS subsamples in Figure 2.
We include the distributions of spectroscopic redshifts,
UV luminosities, and Ly αequivalent widths ( Wλ(Lyα))
for each subsample, alongside their respective medians
and standard errors of the median. The KLCS Lyα,red
and KLCS Lyα−LISsamples have median Wλ(Lyα) and
UV luminosity consistent with those of the full KLCS,
within one standard error. The KLCS sepsample has a
significantly-higher median Wλ(Lyα) than that of the
full KLCS, demonstrating that v sepmeasurements re-
quire larger equivalent widths, such that the flux blue-
ward of systemic was sufficiently detected.
2.3. Sample binning and spectral modeling
While f900can be measured for each object individ-
ually, constraining the LyC leaking in the vicinity of
a galaxy requires an understanding of the attenuationof the signal from neutral hydrogen along the line of
sight in the IGM and CGM. The transmission of LyC
emission varies significantly from sightline to sightline
at the redshifts of our sample, introducing large uncer-
tainties on individual LyC measurements (Rudie et al.
2013; Steidel et al. 2018). To circumvent this sightline
to sightline variability, we used binned subsamples and
composite spectra that reflect average effects of IGM
and CGM attenuation on the LyC spectral region, as in
Steidel et al. (2018). Given the range in sample sizes of
the three KLCS subsamples, we discuss the feasibility
of recovering trends between fescand Ly αprofile shape
in Appendix A, considering the inherent uncertainties
introduced by sample variance and IGM/CGM variabil-
ity. We excluded KLCS sepfrom any fescanalyses due
to its small sample size and the large f900uncertainties
associated with binned subsamples with size ≤8. We
included KLCS Lyα,redand KLCS Lyα−LISand considered
them appropriate for investigating fescvs. v Lyα,redand
fescvs. v Lyα−LIS, respectively.
In order to understand how ionizing-spectral prop-
erties vary with v Lyα,redand v Lyα−LIS, we bin the
KLCS Lyα,redsample as a function of v Lyα,redand the
KLCS Lyα−LISsample as a function of v Lyα−LIS. We
create two bins for each property, with each v Lyα,red
bin containing 22 or 23 galaxies, and each v Lyα−LISbin
containing 33 or 34 galaxies1. We additionally bin both
KLCS Lyα,redand KLCS Lyα−LISbyWλ(Lyα).
For each subsample, we generated composite spectra
representing the average spectral properties of the com-
ponent galaxies. We follow the methodology of Stei-
del et al. (2018) (also see Pahl et al. 2021, 2022, 2023).
Briefly, each individual spectrum is first normalized to
the average flux density in the non-ionizing UV spec-
tral region. We then computed the sigma-clipped mean
of the distribution of flux densities at each rest-frame
wavelength increment, with clipping applied at 3 σ. We
did not apply sigma clipping to the Ly αspectral region
(1200−1230˚A) to avoid censoring the actual line emis-
sion in this region.
We determined ⟨f900/f1500⟩obs, a metric defined as the
ratio between the mean flux densities in the Lyman con-
tinuum (LyC) region (880 −910˚A,f900) and the non-
ionizing UV continuum (1475 −1525˚A,f1500), for each
composite spectrum. While this ratio offers insights into
the average observed leakage of ionizing photons, it is
necessary to address the impact of reduced transmis-
sion from the IGM in the LyC region in order to under-

stand the emergent ionizing signal at the galaxy’s edge.
We applied corrections to the spectra using the average
”IGM+CGM” transmission functions sourced from Stei-
del et al. (2018). These corrections were computed at the
mean redshift specific to each composite subsample. The
basis for these corrections was grounded in the statistics
of Hiabsorption systems along QSO sightlines, as elu-
cidated by Rudie et al. (2012) and Rudie et al. (2013).
After applying the correction, we recalculated the ratio
off900tof1500to derive ⟨f900/f1500⟩out, introduced ear-
lier. This metric encapsulates the ratio that would be
observed at 50 proper kpc from the galaxy center, as
detailed in Steidel et al. (2018).
For each composite spectrum, we derive fescby again
following the methodology originally presented in Stei-
del et al. (2018). While ⟨f900/f1500⟩outis a useful em-
pirical metric for quantifying leaking LyC radiation anddoes not rely on model choices, fescretains widespread
use in reionization models. We used the Binary Popula-
tion and Spectral Synthesis stellar-population synthesis
models (BPASS v2.2.1 Eldridge et al. 2017), combining
these models with a SMC extinction curve (Gordon et al.
2003), and considered a range of E(B-V) values from 0.0
to 0.6, along with a fixed metallicity of 0.07 times solar.
To model the ISM, we adopt the“holes”model, assuming
that LyC light escapes through a patchy neutral-phase
gas (Zackrisson et al. 2013; Reddy et al. 2016b, 2022;
Steidel et al. 2018). The free parameters of the fit are
the neutral gas covering fraction fc, the column density
of neutral hydrogen N HI, and the dust attenuation from
the foreground gas E(B-V) cov(with the uncorrected por-
tion assumed to be dust-free). In the “holes” model, fesc
is derived from fc, where fesc= 1−fc.8 Pahl et al.
In order to estimate the uncertainty in average es-
cape parameters for a given set of galaxies, we must
understand the level of variability induced from sample
construction and from the errors on individual galaxy
properties. We follow the procedure described in Pahl
et al. (2023). We randomly perturb each measurement
(vLyα,red, vLyα−LIS,Wλ(Lyα)) by a Gaussian with width
equal to its error. We sorted objects into two bins us-
ing the new, perturbed parameter histograms. In order
to incorporate sample variance, we then bootstrap re-
sampled (with replacement) the galaxies in each binned
sample. We performed this procedure 100 times, in or-
der to generate 100 sets of objects for each binned sub-
sample. Following that, we generated composite spectra
and assessed the escape of ionizing photons for each ran-
dom draw, employing the previously outlined procedure
in this section. The average and standard deviation of
the distributions of ⟨f900/f1500⟩obs,⟨f900/f1500⟩out, and
fescderived from the 100 composite spectra served as
the fiducial value and error estimate for the respective
binned sample.
3.RESULTS
In order to understand how fescdepends on Ly αpro-
file shape and kinematics, we measured v sep, vLyα,red,
and v Lyα−LISfor different subsets of the KLCS. We dis-
play these velocity measurements in the histograms in
Figure 3. Within each histogram, the median value is
displayed as a dashed, vertical line. This line represents
the bin edge from which two equally-sized samples were
constructed for composite spectra generation. We also
display the relationships between the velocity measure-
ments in the scatterplots in Figure 3. We see correlations
between v Lyα,redand v sep, and no correlation between
vLyα−LISand v sepalthough the sample of KLCS galax-
ies with v sepmeasurements is too small to do formal
analysis. The sample of objects with both v Lyα,redand
vLyα−LISmeasurements is 36, large enough to use the
Spearman rank correlation test to quantify the relation-
ship between the two variables. With the null hypoth-
esis being that v Lyα,redand v Lyα−LISare uncorrelated,
we find a correlation coefficient of 0.487 with a p-value
of 0.003. This result significantly rejects the null hy-
pothesis, and indicates that v Lyα,redis correlated with
vLyα−LIS.
For each binned sample illustrated in Figure 3, we cre-
ated a composite in order to understand their average
ionizing and non-ionizing rest-UV spectra. To highlight
the Ly αprofiles of the objects in each bin, we display
composites generated from bins of v Lyα,redand v Lyα−LIS
in Figure 4. Both v Lyα,red,highand v Lyα−LIS,highfea-
ture Ly αprofiles shifted to larger redshifted veloci-ties. Meanwhile, v Lyα,red,lowand v Lyα−LIS,lowhave a
larger amount of Ly αflux observed at systemic, which
indicates objects with these properties have more re-
gions in their ISM and CGM with low-column-density
(≲1012cm−2), neutral-phase gas. Double peaked struc-
ture is apparent in all composites. However, all com-
posites save for v Lyα,red,lowhave a blue-side profile that
is unresolved from the stronger, red-side profile. Fi-
nally, v Lyα,red,lowfeatures stronger Ly αemission than
vLyα,red,high, indicating that galaxies with Ly αprofiles
less offset from systemic also have larger Ly αequivalent
widths, as both are modulated by the covering fraction
of neutral gas. Consistent with this result, surveys of
LAEs have been demonstrated to have lower v Lyα,red
(and higher Wλ(Lyα)) than typical LBGs (e.g., Trainor
et al. 2015). In contrast with the KLCS v Lyα−LIScom-
posites, surveys of LBGs have shown a direct correla-
tion between v Lyα−LISandWλ(Lyα), although across a
larger dynamic range of v Lyα−LISthan is probed by our
bins (e.g., Shapley et al. 2003).
From these composites, we conducted three assess-
ments of ionizing photon escape, as explained in Section
2.3. The first measurement, denoted as ⟨f900/f1500⟩obs,
represents the ratio of ionizing to non-ionizing flux
density observed directly in the composite derived
from individual spectra. The second measurement,
⟨f900/f1500⟩out, is the same ratio calculated from a com-
posite spectrum that has been adjusted for the average
line-of-sight attenuation caused by the IGM and CGM.
Lastly, fescis a parameter estimated through stellar pop-
ulation synthesis modeling of the entire rest-UV compos-
ite. In Figure 5, we present these three assessments of
ionizing escape along with their respective uncertainties,
organized by galaxy property for each subsample. The
numerical values corresponding to these results can be
found in Table 2, which also includes the median prop-
erties of the galaxies within each subsample.
In order to determine whether ionizing-photon escape
is correlated with a given kinematic measurement of
Lyα, we determine significance as defined by Pahl et al.
(2022). For two composites constructed via binning
across a galaxy property, fescis significantly correlated
with this property only when

and⟨f900/f1500⟩obsand galaxy property are determined
in an identical fashion.Lyαprofile shape and fesc 9

cording to Equation 7, the difference in ⟨f900/f1500⟩out
measurements between the two bins of v Lyα,redis signif-
icant (1 σ). The difference between fescmeasurements,
however, does not meet our significance threshold. For a
given composite, ⟨f900/f1500⟩outmay not precisely trace
fesc, asfescdepends on stellar population modeling and
fits to the entire rest-UV spectrum, including Lyman-
series absorption lines. The trends with v Lyα,redcan be
compared to correlations between ⟨f900/f1500⟩out,fesc,
andWλ(Lyα) within the same subsample, shown in theupper right panel. We see a significant difference in
both⟨f900/f1500⟩outandfesc(1σand 2 σ, respectively)
between the two bins of Wλ(Lyα) in the KLCS Lyα,red
subsample, reflecting the correlation of the two param-
eters in the full KLCS (Steidel et al. 2018; Pahl et al.
2021). Despite any differences in the ionizing spectra
across bins of v Lyα,red, it is clear that any anti correla-
tion between fescand v Lyα,redis less significant than that
between fescandWλ(Lyα). Nonetheless, the fact that
significant correlations are found when binning across
vLyα,redandWλ(Lyα) is not surprising considering both
lower v Lyα,redand higher Wλ(Lyα) probe conditions in10 Pahl et al.

the ISM and CGM that are conducive to ionizing-photon
escape: lower covering fractions of neutral gas, which at-
tenuates and resonantly-scatters Ly α.
In contrast to v Lyα,red, in the the lower right panel of
Figure 5, we do not see a significant difference in fesc,
⟨f900/f1500⟩outor⟨f900/f1500⟩obsacross the two bins
of v Lyα−LIS. This lack of significant difference can be
compared to the significant difference in fescmeasured
across two bins of Wλ(Lyα) in the KLCS Lyα−LISsample,
shown in the lower right panel. This result indicates that
vLyα−LISmay not be a robust proxy for fescatz∼3.
While v Lyα,redrepresents the amount that the peak of
Lyαemission is offset from systemic due to resonant
scattering from neutral-phase gas, v Lyα−LISincludes the
velocity offset from low-ionization absorption, which is
sensitive to the velocity of the (typically) outflowing ma-terial. Additionally, the metal-enriched gas responsible
for LIS absorption may have a different velocity distribu-
tion and/or covering fraction than that of the gas that is
responsible for the attenuation of Ly αand LyC photons.
Studies have shown that covering fractions derived from
metal lines are systematically lower than those deduced
from H iabsorption lines (e.g., Reddy et al. 2016b; Gaza-
gnes et al. 2018; Reddy et al. 2022). We note that the
bins in the KLCS Lyα−LISsample (lower panels) contain
∼34 galaxies each, while the bins in the KLCS Lyα,red
sample (upper panels) contain ∼23 galaxies. This dif-
ference introduces larger uncertainties in fescfor the
composites generated from bins of v Lyα,red, both from
sample variance and errors on assumed IGM transmis-
sion fractions. However, v Lyα−LISmeasurements have
typically-larger uncertainties than v Lyα,red(79 km s−1
and 39 km s−1, respectively). Thus, through our boot-
strapping procedure, more galaxies near the v Lyα−LIS
bin edge will move across bins when generating per-
turbed samples, which will result in larger error bars
infesc.
4.DISCUSSION
While measurements of the profile shape of Ly αhave
been demonstrated to correlate with fescat low redshift
(e.g., Izotov et al. 2018b), these results must be validated
at high redshift before extrapolating to the reionization
era, and must be considered in context of what is feasibly
observable at z≳5.5 when the IGM is significantly more
neutral. Here, we discuss our results in context of those
from low-redshift ( z∼0.3) surveys, and attempt to con-
nect our results to observations of the earliest galaxies,
including recent results from JWST .
4.1. Comparison to low redshift surveys
The connections between fescand galaxy properties at
z∼3 provide key insights into the physics of ionizing-
photon escape, and help ground assumptions of fescfor
reionization-era galaxies. We found that galaxies with
red-side peaks more offset from systemic (thus, higher
vLyα,red) did not have significantly-different fescvalues
than those with lower v Lyα,red. We do find a signif-
icant difference in the IGM-corrected ionizing to non-
ionizing flux ratio ⟨f900/f1500⟩outacross bins of v Lyα,red,
which is less model dependent measurement of the es-
cape of ionizing radiation. Conversely, we find galax-
ies with larger velocity differences between the peak
of Ly αemission and low-ionization absorption absorp-
tion (thus, higher v Lyα−LIS) do not have significantly-
different fescor⟨f900/f1500⟩outvalues than those with
lower v Lyα−LIS.Lyαprofile shape and fesc 11

Figure 5. Different measurements of ionizing photon escape estimated for binned subsamples of the KLCS. Each measurement
is displayed with respect to the median property of the objects contained in each bin. The blue circles are ⟨f900/f1500⟩obs
measurements, which are computed directly from the composite spectra. The purple stars are ⟨f900/f1500⟩outmeasurements,
which include a correction to f900from attenuation from the IGM and outer CGM. Estimates of fescof composite spectra are
displayed as gold squares, which rely on stellar-population synthesis modeling and ISM geometry featuring “holes” free from
neutral gas and dust (Steidel et al. 2018; Reddy et al. 2016b, 2022). The blue circles and purple stars are slightly shifted left
and right, respectively, for visual clarity. The upper two panels are both constructed from the same parent sample, which are
all KLCS objects with both Ly αand systemic velocity measurements. The lower two panels are constructed from a sample of
galaxies with Ly αemission and LIS absorption velocity measurements. We measure a significant difference in ⟨f900/f1500⟩out
across the two bins of v Lyα,red, while we find no significant difference in either ⟨f900/f1500⟩outorfescacross bins of v Lyα−LIS.
In the z∼0.3 Universe, LyC radiation from star-
forming galaxies is observable using the HST -COS spec-
trograph and is fully unobscured thanks fewer absorbers
in the IGM (e.g., Weymann et al. 1998). Searches for
LyC leakers have revealed an anti-correlation between
fescand Ly αpeak separation, v sep, often presented as
the strongest tracer of fescwithin local reionization-era
analogs (Izotov et al. 2016b, 2018b, 2021; Flury et al.
2022a,b). Considering the apparent correlation observed
between v sepand v Lyα,redin the KLCS, it is reason-
able that we found a significant (1 σ) correlation between
⟨f900/f1500⟩outand v Lyα,redatz∼3. We contrast the
vsep-vLyα,redrelationship in the KLCS and that from
z∼0.3 Green Peas in literature in the left panel of
Figure 6. A correlation between v sepand v Lyα,redis
found in both redshift samples, although KLCS galax-ies have larger v Lyα,redand v sepvalues. We note that
Lyαphotons adopt the velocities of neutral Hydrogen in
the CGM in order to escape their source galaxy (Stei-
del et al. 2010), and the amplitudes of typical out-
flow velocities in the CGM are mass dependent, such
that more massive galaxies tend to have faster outflows
(Weiner et al. 2009; Martin et al. 2012; Chisholm et al.
2015). Given that the Green Peas from the literature
are roughly an order of magnitude lower in M ∗than
our KLCS LBGs, it is expected that our velocity mea-
surements are higher overall. We perform a orthogonal
distance regression on the z∼0.3 data using the python
package scipy and find the relation

We display this best-fit relation and the corresponding
95% confidence region as a solid and dashed black lines,
respectively, in the left panel of Figure 6. By comparing
to the average trend at low redshift, we see a offset to
larger v sepvalues at fixed v Lyα,redatz∼3 when com-
pared to the lower-redshift data. Stated in a different
way, this difference indicates that our sample has Ly α
profiles with larger blue-side velocity offsets (i.e., more
negative) at fixed red-side velocity offset when compared
to low-redshift Green Peas. This difference appears to
indicate that the shape of Ly αprofiles may not be struc-
tured in the same way across redshift. Unfortunately,
this comparison can only be made for a highly limited
subsample within the KLCS: this figure contains the
seven galaxies with double-peaked Ly αemission profiles
sufficiently resolved in the R∼800−1400 spectra and
have follow up observations of rest-optical nebular lines.
Given the difference in spectral resolution between the
two samples, we discuss the effects of spectral resolution
on our velocity measurements in Appendix B. A larger
sample of resolved blue Ly αpeaks for KLCS objects
would allow for a more robust test of this evolution.
We expand upon potential differences between low-
and high-redshift Ly αprofiles by displaying low-redshift
data for both fescvs. v sepandfescvs. v Lyα,redin Figure
7, alongside our results found in bins of v Lyα,red. Con-
sidering our small sample size of objects with v sepmea-
surements in the KLCS, we were unable to make binsof sufficient size to precisely constrain fescas a function
of vsepatz∼3. In the left panel of Figure 7, we show
thefesc-vseprelation reported in Izotov et al. (2016b)
alongside published z∼0.3 leakers from the literature,
including z∼0.3 Green Peas without LyC observations
from Yang et al. (2017). We translate this trendline into
vLyα,redspace by using Equation 8; the translated rela-
tion is displayed as a black, solid line in the middle panel
of Figure 7. At z∼0.3,fescis much more tightly corre-
lated with v septhan with v Lyα,red. This result appears
to indicate that v Lyα,redis a substandard indicator for
fescas compared to v sep. We also find that v Lyα,redis a
substandard indicator of fescas compared to Wλ(Lyα)
in Figure 5, although correlation is still shown between
⟨f900/f1500⟩outand v Lyα,red. At v Lyα,redvalues where
direct comparison can be made across redshift, we find
higher fescvalues in the KLCS at fixed v Lyα,redwhen
compared to z∼0.3 leakers. Critically, it appears that
relationships between fescand Ly αprofile shape may
not be invariant across redshift. The KLCS Lyα,redsam-
ple has a median vLyα,red= 323 km s−1, which would
correspond to vsep= 576 km s−1according to Equation
8. Using the fesc-vseprelation fit in Izotov et al. (2018b),
this v sepvalue would correspond to fesc∼0.01, sig-
nificantly different from the full-sample measurement of
fesc= 0.06±0.01. At z∼3, it appears that fescis higher

Figure 6. Comparison between the the velocity separation between the peaks of Ly αemission (v sep) and the velocity offset of
different peaks of Ly αemission and systemic, both at low redshift and this work. Measurements of galaxies at z∼0.3, primarily
Green Peas, are sourced from Yang et al. (2017); Gazagnes et al. (2020); and Flury et al. (2022a). Measurements presented
in Gazagnes et al. (2020) include objects originally published in Pettini & Pagel (2004); Izotov et al. (2011, 2016b,a, 2018b,a);
Leitherer et al. (2016); and Chisholm et al. (2017). Left panel: Comparison between v sepand the velocity offset of the red side
of Ly αemission and systemic (v Lyα,red). Both KLCS and z∼0.3 samples show a positive correlation between v sepand v Lyα,red,
while KLCS objects show higher v sepand v Lyα,redmeasurements on average than the z∼0.3 objects. A linear relationship fit
to the z∼0.3 data is shown as a black, dotted line. The 95% confidence region for this fit is shown with dashed, black lines.
Right panel: Comparison between v sepand the velocity offset of the blue side of Ly αemission and systemic (v Lyα,blue). A
linear relationship fit to the z∼0.3 data is shown as a black, solid line. The 95% confidence region for this fit is shown with

are also generally lower in UV luminosity and higher in
SFR as compared to the KLCS, which would not neces-
sarily suppress fescin these samples (Pahl et al. 2023).
Furthermore, as discussed in Flury et al. (2022b), KLCS
composites have higher fescat fixed Wλ(Lyα) than the
z∼0.3 objects within the LzLCS survey. We therefore
exercise caution in using fescdeterminations at high red-
shift (i.e., z >2) built directly from Ly αproperties of
low ( z∼0.3) redshift analogs, discussed further in Sec-
tion 4.3.
When comparing fescestimates across different works,
it is necessary to examine any differences in underlying
model assumptions. All fescestimates displayed in Fig-
ure 7 assume an intrinsic ionizing flux based on stellar
population fits to a galaxy’s spectrum, which is subse-
quently compared to the observed ionizing spectrum in
order to compute fesc. Choice of model SED necessar-
ily changes the estimation of fesc. In this work, we used
BPASS SPS models, in contrast to the Starburst99 mod-
els assumed by the low-redshift LyC surveys discussed
in this section (Leitherer et al. 1999). BPASS, whichincludes prescriptions for binary stars, yields larger val-
ues of intrinsic f900than Starburst99, thus our KLCS
galaxies will have comparatively-lower fescvalues from
this model choice alone (Chisholm et al. 2019). Treat-
ment of dust within spectral fits similarly affects fesc
estimates. In our fescmodeling discussed in Section 2.3,
we assumed an SMC dust attenuation curve, and that
the ISM within KLCS galaxies include “holes” free of
both neutral gas and dust. The z∼0.3fescestimates
discussed in this section instead assume a Reddy et al.
(2016a) dust attenuation curve, and that the dust is sit-
uated in a uniform screen. If these model choices were
applied to our analysis of KLCS objects, our reported
fescvalues would be elevated (Steidel et al. 2018). Con-
sidering that our model choices only shift our fescesti-
mates to comparatively-lower values, we conclude that
theincreased fescat fixed Ly αprofile shape seen within
the KLCS is not driven by inconsistent methodology.14 Pahl et al.

95% confidence interval computed for Equation 8 is also translated and is displayed via a dashed line. We also translate the fesc
criteria of Naidu et al. (2022) into v Lyα,redspace using the same equation. We see a larger fescat fixed v Lyα,redwithin the KLCS
in comparison to literature z∼0.3 LyC leakers. We also find a significant discrepancy between the fescof the v Lyα,red,lowKLCS
subsample and the translated fesccriteria of Naidu et al. (2022). Right panel: fescvs. v Lyα,blueforz∼0.3 LyC leakers from the

thez∼0.3 sample.
4.2. Red vs. blue Ly αpeaks
Considering the apparent relationship between v sep
and v Lyα,redacross redshift, one would expect each to
modulate the escape fraction of ionizing photons in
a similar way. The tenuous trend between fescand
vLyα,redwithin the z∼0.3 high-redshift analogs moti-
vates a closer examination of which physical properties
of the neutral-phase ISM and CGM are probed by v sep
and v Lyα,red. Additionally, in the reionization era, any
Lyαemission bluewards of systemic will be resonantly
absorbed by optically thick neutral gas in the nearby
IGM (e.g., Mason & Gronke 2020), making the obser-
vation of double-peaked structure exceedingly difficult.
Understanding any physical differences between v sepand
vLyα,red, and analogously, v Lyα,blueand v Lyα,red, is of
critical importance when interpreting Ly αprofiles dur-
ing the epoch of reionization in the context of escaping
ionizing radiation.We show v sepvs. v Lyα,bluefor the KLCS and z∼0.3
samples in the right panel of Figure 6, and see a tighter
correlation as compared to that of v sepand v Lyα,red
across both redshift samples. This tighter correlation
was reported in previous analyses of z∼0.3 Green Peas
(Henry et al. 2015; Verhamme et al. 2017; Orlitov´ a et al.
2018). We display the z∼0.3fesc-vLyα,bluecorrelation
from literature sources in the right panel of Figure 7,
and see a similar correlation as that with v sep, in con-
trast to the relative lack of correlation with v Lyα,red.
Again, due to a lack of a large sample of KLCS galaxy
measurements with v Lyα,blue, these relationships remain
untested at high redshift. However, at lower redshift it
is clear that the configuration of the neutral-phase ISM
and CGM that concerns ionizing-photon escape are more
tied to the observable parameters of v Lyα,blueand v sep,
rather than v Lyα,red.
Simple radiative transfer models of Ly αfeature the
neutral-phase CGM distributed in a homogeneous shellLyαprofile shape and fesc 15
around a source. In these models, the escape fraction
of ionizing radiation is related to the column density of
neutral hydrogen (N HI), which is optically thin to LyC
radiation. In these models, both v sepand v Lyα,redare
modulated by N HI, although small v Lyα,redis not a suf-
ficient condition for identifying a LyC leaker. Lower
values of v Lyα,redmay also be driven by high outflow
velocities, rather than higher Ly αand LyC escape frac-
tions (Verhamme et al. 2015). Our measurements of
vLyα−LIScontrast the position of the red-side peak of
Lyαto that of low-ionization metal absorption lines,
which are produced in the intervening material in the
ISM/CGM and directly encode their kinematics. We
find a lack of correlation between fescand v Lyα−LIS
within the KLCS, which supports the idea that greater
outflow velocities do not significantly affect measured
fescvalues. More systemic redshift measurements are
needed to directly test the correlations between fescand
LIS velocities within the KLCS. Nonetheless, LIS lines
likely do encode information about the covering fraction
of neutral material and thus fesc: Saldana-Lopez et al.
(2022) have presented empirical calibrations that use the
depth of LIS lines and dust attenuation measurements
to predict the escape fractions of LzLCS galaxies (see
also Reddy et al. 2016b).
It’s likely that the multiphase ISM in z∼3 galaxies
is more complex and dynamically perturbed than homo-
geneous shells. Our modeling of composite spectra as-
sumes that clear channels in an optically-thick neutral-
phase medium allow Ly αand LyC photons to escape
unabated. This scenario is supported observationally
by the connections between Ly αequivalent width, LIS
absorption strength, and E(B-V) found in z∼2−5
galaxy surveys (e.g. Shapley et al. 2003; Jones et al.
2012; Du et al. 2018; Pahl et al. 2021). Indeed, in Kaki-
ichi & Gronke (2021), radiation hydrodynamics simu-
lations indicate that galaxies with highly-asymmetric
Lyαprofiles, such as those in the KLCS, feature both
optically-thick and thin channels that govern the escape
of LyC photons. These types of profiles are ubiquitous
at high redshift (Steidel et al. 2010; Kulas et al. 2012;
Hashimoto et al. 2015; Trainor et al. 2015). Modeling
pursued in Orlitov´ a et al. (2018) notes the puzzling dif-
ferences between v Lyα,redand v Lyα,bluein the context of
poor fits when assuming a homogeneous, expanding shell
of neutral Hydrogen. They find that by including sys-
temic redshifts in their fits, the spherical-shell fit fails,
as objects with weak blue-side Ly αpeaks do not have
symmetric Ly αprofiles across systemic. Other studies
of the radiative transfer of Ly αexplore the differences
between v Lyα,redand v Lyα,blue. In Gronke & Dijkstra
(2016), the authors utilize Monte-Carlo radiative trans-fer simulations of Ly αthrough a clumpy medium and
find the physical parameters that affect the emergent
profile shape. They find that v Lyα,redis sensitive to
clump covering fraction and clump radial velocity, while
vLyα,blueis more sensitive to the column density of the
static, hot inter-clump medium.
Under an assumption of a heterogeneous medium, the
red-side Ly αprofile will not directly reflect properties
of the foreground gas. Ly αphotons redward of systemic
primarily take paths that backscatter off of outflowing
material behind the galaxy, while those blueward of sys-
temic are scattered off resonance by gas (e.g., Steidel
et al. 2010). This fact alone may explain why fescis less
sensitive to v Lyα,redthan v sepor v Lyα,blue, as gas in the
background does not attenuate LyC photons traveling
in the line-of-sight direction. Considering that viewing
angle is expected to strongly affect emergent Ly αpro-
files (e.g., Blaizot et al. 2023), it stands to reason that
sample-averaged statistics may smooth out these varia-
tions, and v Lyα,redis still predictive of average ionizing-
photon escape, as in the KLCS.
4.3. Thefescassumptions of Naidu et al. (2022)
The primary goal of this work was to test the connec-
tion between fescand Ly αprofile shape in the z∼3
Universe, and whether trends found at lower redshift
hold. While the KLCS does not currently have the
spectral resolution to discern double-peak structure for
the majority of the sample, detailed spectral analyses of
higher-resolution Ly αprofiles at intermediate redshifts
have been performed, like those of the XLS- z2 survey
(Matthee et al. 2021). We can use the Ly αprofiles of
the KLCS, which have the added benefit of direct LyC
measurements, to add indirect fescconstraints to the
objects in this survey.
The XLS- z2 survey features 35 z∼2 LAEs, selected
primarily via narrow-band imaging and targeted with
the X-SHOOTER spectrograph on VLT with spectral
resolution of R∼4000. Systemic redshifts were also
recovered for 33/35 of the sources. Using criteria empir-
ically motivated from the Ly αprofiles of LyC leakers,
Naidu et al. (2022) presented a framework for predicting
fescusing the Ly αprofiles of XLS- z2 objects alone. The
resulting criteria were based on measurements from LyC
leakers at z∼0.3, as well as a few individually-leaking
objects found at z∼2−4 (although individual LyC
detections at high redshift have highly-uncertain fesc).
The criteria were two-fold: objects with low v sepor high
flux densities at systemic ( fcen) were assumed to have
>20% fesc, while objects with high v sepand low fcen
were assumed to have <5%fesc. The v sepcriteria are
displayed in shaded regions in the left panel of Figure 7.16 Pahl et al.
By introducing criteria based on v sep, the sample also
demonstrated a connection between assumed fescand
vLyα,red. Composite spectra of the low- and high- fesc
XLS- z2 galaxies featured different v Lyα,red: those with
assumed fesc>20% had vLyα,red= 106±3 km s−1, while
those with fesc<5% had vLyα,red= 254 ±4 km s−1.
We attempt to test the fescassumptions of Naidu
et al. (2022) directly with the KLCS by translating
the v sep-based fesccriteria into one based on v Lyα,red.
Using Equation 8 and assuming a direct relationship
between the two variables, the “high escape” objects
would have vLyα,red<89 km s−1, while the “low es-
cape” objects would have vLyα,red>164 km s−1. The
translated criteria are displayed as shaded regions in
the middle panel of Figure 7. The KLCS objects span
a dynamic range of v Lyα,redthat allow a comparison
to the fesc<5% region: the v Lyα,red,lowcomposite
hasfesc= 0.08±0.03, which lies outside of the re-
gion. The “low escape” spectral stack of Naidu et al.
(2022) can also be directly compared to this v Lyα,red,low
KLCS stack. The X-SHOOTER composite spectrum
hasvLyα,red= 254 ±4 km s−1,Wλ(Lyα) = 61 ±3˚A, and
an assumed fesc<5%. In comparison, the v Lyα,red,low
stack has a median vLyα,red= 242 ±14 km s−1and
Wλ(Lyα) = 21 ±7. The v Lyα,red,lowstack, despite hav-
ing lower Wλ(Lyα) than that of the“low escape”stack of
Naidu et al. (2022), has a significantly larger fescvalue
than that assumed when using the Ly α-based criteria in
Naidu et al. (2022). It is likely that fescmeasured for the
vLyα,red,lowstack would be even higher if the Wλ(Lyα)
were comparable to the“low escape”stack of Naidu et al.
(2022), considering the direct connection between fesc
andWλ(Lyα) ubiquitous in z∼2−4 LyC samples
(Steidel et al. 2018; Marchi et al. 2018; Begley et al.
2022). While we cannot directly test the fescassump-
tions of Naidu et al. (2022) without higher-resolution
spectra of the KLCS, these discrepancies indicate that
fescassumptions based on Ly αprofile shape may not be
consistent across all samples, especially across redshift
and/or galaxy properties such as stellar mass, UV lumi-
nosity and SFR. From the comparison presented in this
section, it appears that fescvalues inferred from low- z
scaling relations will be underestimated.
4.4. Lyαprofiles during reionization
The connections between fescand galaxy properties
atz∼3 can indicate the most appropriate assumptions
forfescat even higher redshifts, during the epoch of
reionization. We find that galaxies with red-side peaks
more offset from systemic (thus, higher v Lyα,red) tend
to have lower ⟨f900/f1500⟩outvalues, although they did
not have significantly-different fescvalues. We also findthat, at fixed v Lyα,red(and implied v sep),fescis higher
atz∼3 than at z∼0.3. Nonetheless, v Lyα,redmay be
the best proxy of v sepactually observable for galaxies in
the reionization era. In simulations of Ly αtransmission
fractions at z∼6, typical sightlines through the neutral-
phase IGM feature feature complete attenuation of Ly α
flux below 1216 ˚A (Laursen et al. 2011).
Despite the difficulty of observing blue-side Ly αflux
in the epoch of reionization, a handful of z≳6 galax-
ies have been observed with this signature (Hu et al.
2016; Songaila et al. 2018; Bosman et al. 2020). The
mere observability of blue-side Ly αindicates that these
photons are traveling through highly-transparent and
unique sightlines through the IGM, and these objects
are residing in ionized bubbles (Mason & Gronke 2020).
While such signatures are useful for examining these rare
objects and probing the topology of reionization, the
vast majority of galaxies will not have observed blue-
side Ly αflux.
In contrast, the red-side peak of Ly αand associated
nebular emission lines required to constrain zsys, and
thus v Lyα,red, are observable at extreme redshifts. A lim-
ited number of v Lyα,redmeasurements have been made
forz >6 galaxies using C iii] as a probe of zsys(Stark
et al. 2015, 2017; Hutchison et al. 2019). More recently,
surveys targeting [C ii] and [O iii] with ALMA have
found further success (e.g., Cassata et al. 2020; Ends-
ley et al. 2022). With the advent of JWST/NIRSpec,
rest-optical nebular emission lines are more readily re-
coverable at z >6, and samples with v Lyα,redmeasure-
ments are growing (Tang et al. 2023). These objects
have v Lyα,redbetween ∼100 km s−1and∼800 km s−1,
withWλ(Lyα)<100˚A and −23<MUV<−19. Our fesc
estimates as a function of both v Lyα,redandWλ(Lyα)
represent the first comparison sample to these objects
drawn from a z∼3 sample. Based on Ly αalone,
objects such as REBELS-23 ( vLyα,red= 227 km s−1,
Wλ(Lyα) = 14 ˚A; Endsley et al. 2022) may have fesc∼
0.08, considering its similarity to our v Lyα,red,lowsub-
sample.
Direct comparison to Ly αprofiles at z >6 has some
caveats. At the neutral fractions of the IGM during
reionization, even the blue side of the red Ly αpeak be-
gins to be attenuated, which is more prominent closer
to systemic (Laursen et al. 2011). This attenuation will
bias v Lyα,redto higher values as the Ly αprofiles become
asymmetrically modulated. Additionally, Ly αprofiles
that have strong emission significantly redward of sys-
temic will be preferentially observed, preventing an un-
biased view into the average velocity offsets of different
populations of reionization-era galaxies. Despite these
caveats, there is promising evidence that the Ly αpro-Lyαprofile shape and fesc 17
files of UV bright populations may not be fully atten-
uated by the neutral IGM at z > 6. The Wλ(Lyα)
distribution in M UV<−21 galaxies appears not to de-
cline from 6 < z < 8 (Endsley et al. 2021; Jung et al.
2022; Roberts-Borsani et al. 2023), and Ly αappears to
be ubiquitous in this population at z∼7.5−9 (e.g.,
Stark et al. 2017; Larson et al. 2022). Thus, for lumi-
nous galaxies in particular, the strength and shape of
Lyαmay be a valid indicator of fescatz≳6.
5.SUMMARY
In this work, we investigate the connections between
Lyαprofile shape and ionizing-photon escape at high
redshift, as a complement and comparison to existing
analyses at z∼0.3 (e.g., Izotov et al. 2016b, 2018b,
2021; Flury et al. 2022a,b). To this end, we utilized
KLCS galaxies, for which R∼800−1400, rest-UV spec-
troscopy is available. These spectra cover both the Ly α
spectral feature and the LyC spectral region, with suf-
ficient depth to sensitively constrain fescin composite
spectra. By making quantitative measurements of Ly α
and binning the KLCS as a function of these proper-
ties, we explored the connections between the velocity
structure of Ly αand the escape of ionizing radiation in
z∼3 star-forming galaxies. Our main conclusions are
as follows:
1. We find positive correlations between the velocity
separation between the red-side peak of Ly αand
systemic redshift v Lyα,redand the Ly αpeak sepa-
ration v sepwithin the KLCS, but we lack the sam-
ple size to quantify the significance of this trend.
We find a significant correlation between v Lyα,red
and and velocity separation between the red-side
peak of Ly αand the low-ionization interstellar
redshift v Lyα−LIS. When comparing our measure-
ments to samples of z∼0.3 Green Peas from the
literature, we find an evolution in the v sep-vLyα,red
relationship with redshift. Galaxies at z∼3 from
the KLCS have larger v sepat fixed v Lyα,red, indi-
cating that Ly αprofile shapes potentially evolve
with redshift and/or stellar mass.
2. We find a significant (1 σ), negative correlation
between the ionizing to non-ionizing flux ratio
⟨f900/f1500⟩outand v Lyα,redwithin the KLCS,
found across two bins of v Lyα,red. We find no
significant differences for any measure of ionizing-
photon escape across two bins of v Lyα−LIS. The
connection between ⟨f900/f1500⟩outand v Lyα,redis
supported by radiative transfer models that con-
nect increasing covering fractions of neutral gas
to larger velocity shifts that Ly αphotons mustadopt to escape from a galaxy (e.g., Steidel et al.
2010). We contrast our fescmeasurements in two
bins of v Lyα,redto that of literature LyC leakers
atz∼0.3, and find larger fescat fixed v Lyα,red
within our higher-redshift sample. From this evo-
lution, we infer that while not only are Ly αpro-
files different across redshift and stellar mass, Ly α
profile shape measurements such as v Lyα,redap-
pear to trace escaping ionizing radiation in a dif-
ferent manner. Building on this point, we perform
a linear fit between v sepand v Lyα,red, and we find
larger fescat fixed v septhan those predicted by
z∼0.3 data. We further conclude that these dif-
ferences could not be caused by inconsistent model
assumptions.
3. We compare the correlations between fescand
vLyα,red, vsep, and v Lyα,blueby compiling results
forz∼0.3 LyC leakers in literature. We find that
fesccorrelates much more strongly with v sepand
vLyα,bluethan with v Lyα,redatz∼0.3, despite our
measured correlation between ⟨f900/f1500⟩outand
vLyα,redwithin the KLCS. We infer that the het-
erogeneity of neutral-phase gas around LyC leak-
ers, which manifests in a large viewing-angle de-
pendence on both Ly αprofile shape and fesc(e.g.,
Verhamme et al. 2012; Behrens & Braun 2014;
Smith et al. 2019, 2022b,a; Blaizot et al. 2023), will
scatter the relationship between fescand v Lyα,red
in individual objects, considering the red side of
Lyαis primarily concerned with gas in the back-
ground of a galaxy. Within the KLCS, we effec-
tively averaged across many viewing angles by cre-
ating composite spectra of subsamples binned as
a function of v Lyα,red, thus probing the average
neutral-gas configuration of galaxies within each
stack.
4. We compare our low-v Lyα,redbin to that of the
“low escape” stack of the XLS- z2 survey presented
in Naidu et al. (2022), in order to test fescas-
sumptions primarily calibrated using local sam-
ples. Our KLCS composite constructed from ob-
jects with the lowest v Lyα,redmeasurements had
an estimated fesc= 0.08±0.03, greater than
the assumed fesc<0.05 in a XLS- z2 compos-
ite with comparable v Lyα,red. While we lack the
higher resolution spectra to directly test their v sep
and central-flux-based criteria, the discrepancy be-
tween the assumed fescat fixed v Lyα,redindicates
that further investigation is needed into the Ly α
profile shapes of LyC leakers across redshift, at18 Pahl et al.
larger dynamic ranges of v Lyα,redand v septhan is
probed by the KLCS.
In the reionization epoch, any Ly αflux blueward
of systemic emitted from typical galaxies is entirely
attenuated due to the neutral-phase IGM. These re-
sults, presented as a function of red-side Ly αprofile
shape, are critical for developing new Ly α-based cri-
teria usable for z > 6 galaxies. In addition, we’ve
demonstrated that aspects of the Ly αprofile and it’s
effects on ionizing-photon escape may evolve with red-
shift and stellar mass. These analyses, performed at
the some of the highest redshift possible, provide im-
portant new insights into the mechanics of ionizing-
photon escape during reionization. Larger samples
with high-resolution, rest-UV spectra covering Ly α,
coupled with direct LyC measurements, across larger
dynamic ranges of galaxy properties are necessary to
build on these results and construct a complete suiteof diagnostics to predict fescof reionization-era galaxies.

A.FEASIBILITY OF RECOVERING TRENDS BETWEEN fescAND LY αPROFILE SHAPE FOR DIFFERENT
SAMPLE SIZES
In Pahl et al. (2022), we performed simulations to determine the minimum sample sizes required to confidently
recover trends between fescand galaxy properties within the KLCS. We used the trend between ⟨f900/f1500⟩outand
Wλ(Lyα) as a measure of the reliability of smaller samples, considering the ubiquity of trends between ionizing-photon

⟨f900/f1500⟩outis defined as the ratio between f900and the average flux density in the non-ionizing UV continuum
(1475 −1525˚A,f1500) after performing an IGM+CGM transmission correction. It is a more model-independent
measurement of escaping ionizing light than fesc, since it is not based on any stellar-population-dependent assumption
of the intrinsic production rate of ionizing radiation. We performed simulations by drawing random samples from the
full KLCS of a fixed sample size, binning the objects into two Wλ(Lyα) subsamples, and determining whether the
resulting composite spectra feature a 1 σdifference between their estimated ⟨f900/f1500⟩outvalues. The Pahl et al.
(2022) simulations were performed in two different modes: one assuming preferential selection of LyC detections, and
one with entirely random selection. The preferential selection mode included all 13 KLCS galaxies individually detected
in LyC for each random draw. This mode was relevant for subset of galaxies in Pahl et al. (2022), which included
all LyC detections. For this work, we consider the preferential LyC detection mode comparable to the KLCS Lyα,red
sample, considering that 8/45 objects are LyC detections, compared to 13/120 for the full KLCS. Both KLCS Lyα−LIS
samples and KLCS sepsamples are more comparable to the random selection mode (6/67 and 1/15 are LyC detections,
respectively).
We used the results from these simulations to determine if the sizes of each samples are adequate for investigation
offescand the respective binned property. In the LyC preferential-selection mode, a sample size of 45 resulted in
a recovery of the ⟨f900/f1500⟩out-Wλ(Lyα) trend in 92% of realizations, indicating that KLCS Lyα,redis appropriate
for determining trends between fescand v Lyα,red. In fully random mode, a sample size of 63 finds the same recovery
in 80% of realizations, while a sample size of 15 recovers the trend in 30%. We therefore disinclude KLCS sepfrom
analyses of ionizing photon escape.Lyαprofile shape and fesc 19
B.EFFECTS OF SPECTRAL RESOLUTION ON VELOCITY MEASUREMENTS
Our conclusions herein are based on relatively low resolution ( R≃800 for LRIS-B, z <3.11;R≃1400 for LRIS-R,
z >3.11) spectra, which results in a small subset of the KLCS with resolved blue-side Ly αpeaks, and thus measurable
peak separations. We therefore relied on the velocity offset of the red-side peak of Ly αwithin this analysis, and in our
comparison to low-redshift data (HST-COS; R≃16000 at Ly α) and the survey of LAEs of XLS- z2 discussed in Naidu
et al. (2022) (X-SHOOTER, R≃4000 at Ly α). Considering the difference in spectral resolution between the KLCS
observations originally presented in Steidel et al. (2018) and these surveys, we discuss the effects of spectral resolution
on our velocity measurements.
In Verhamme et al. (2015), the authors perform simulations on theoretical Ly αprofiles to understand the effects of
broadening from lower-resolution spectrographs on the shape of Ly α. In the lowest resolution ( R∼1000) simulation,
the blue peak of Ly αbecomes a bump on the wing of the stronger, red-side component of the Ly αprofile, or simply
presents an elongated blue-side tail. Similar profile shapes are observed within the KLCS. Across the different-resolution
simulations, the location of the red-side peak of Ly αis well conserved. The peak shifts only slightly to lower values
(by<50 km s−1), indicating that any bias in v Lyα,redwithin our sample is minimal.
We can directly quantify the effects of spectral resolution on the position of the red-side peak of Ly αfor a subset
of the KLCS. In order to resolve additional double-peaked structure of KLCS galaxies with Ly αin emission, we
have obtained a limited amount of follow up Keck/LRIS spectroscopy with the 1200-line grating on the red side
of the dichroic, featuring a spectral resolution of R∼2500. While the sample of KLCS objects with v sepremains
modest, we measured the Ly αred-side peak offsets from systemic, thus v Lyα,red, for 11 KLCS objects with this higher-
resolution data following the procedures presented in Section 2.2. We calculate the velocity difference between v Lyα,red
measured from the low-resolution LRIS data and that measured from the high-resolution data, and find a median
∆v= +56 km s−1with a standard deviation of 63 km s−1, where the high-resolution data typically features smaller
vLyα,redmeasurements. This difference represents a small shift compared to the median v Lyα,redof our sample of
319 km s−1, and is comparable to the typical errors on the v Lyα,redmeasurements of 39 km s−1. Additionally, our
results are presented using bins of v Lyα,redall measured from spectra of similar resolution, thus, our result of ionizing-
photon escape correlations with v Lyα,redwill not be affected by any potential biases from low spectral resolution.
Nonetheless, it is worth noting potential discrepancies when comparing the v Lyα,redvalues of this work and others
with higher spectral resolution.
