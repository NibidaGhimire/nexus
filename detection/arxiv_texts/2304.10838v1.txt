Abstract - Wireless networks that are decentralized and communicate without using existing infrastructure are known as mobile 
ad-hoc networks. The most common sorts of threats and attacks can affect MANETs. Therefore, it is advised to utilize intrusion 
detection, which controls the system to detect additional security issues. Monitoring is essential to avoid attacks and provi de 
extra pr otection against unauthorized access. Although the current solutions have been designed to defeat the attack nodes, they 
still require additional hardware, have considerable delivery delays, do  not offer high throughput or packet delivery ratios, or 
do not do so without using more energy. The capability of a mobile node to forward packets, which is dependent on the platform's 
life quality, may be impacted by the absence of the network node power source. We developed the Safe Routing Approach (SRA), 
which us es behavi our analysis to track and monitor attackers who discard packets during the route discovery process. The 
attacking node recognition system is made for irregular routing node detection to protect the controller network's usual 
properties from becomi ng recognized as an attack node. The suggested method examines the nearby attack nodes and conceals 
the trusted node in the routing pathway . The path is instantly assigned after the initial discovery of trust nodes based on each 
node's strength value. It e xtends the network's life span and reduces packet loss. In terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), energy 
consumption, network performance, and detection of attack nodes, the suggested approach is contrasted with AIS, ZIDS, and 
Improved AODV. The findings de monstrate that the recommended strategy performs superior in terms of PDR, residual energy, 
and network throughput .

1. Introduction  
A collection of network nodes that interact outside of a 
fixed physical structure make up a mobile ad hoc network 
(MANET). MANETs include a variety of noteworthy 
characteristics, including variable topology, quick 
deployment, and multi -hop wi reless transmission  [1]. 
MANET is appropriate for various time -sensitive tasks thanks 
to all these qualities. In cases when it is challenging to 
construct basic infrastructure, ad hoc networks offer a viable 
communication facility. Additionally, with MANET s, mobile 
nodes communicate without requiring a physical 
infrastructure and without engaging in administrative tasks. 
As a result, these systems are flexible, self -organizing, and 
automatically created, enabling nodes to move at will while 
interacting  [2-4]. These systems can be expanded and merged 
to create intelligent solutions for addressing industrial 
demands with cutting -edge technology like cloud computing, 
the IoT, and machine learning methods. Figure 1 shows 
MANET's organizational structure. Given t he changeable 
topology of the MANET, implementing a secure routing 
protocol while assuring the quality of service is challenging. MANET's open communication technology allows any 
adaptable node to  join the network and participate in data 
transmission. In M ANET, this adequate communication 
infrastructure leads to security lapses  [5-8]. 
As the traditional routing techniques for these networks 
presuppose collaborative, trusting settings among mobile 
devices, secure routing in ad -hoc networks was one of the 
main challenges for researchers. Attackers can readily hack 
authorized corporate mobile nodes to cause a variety of packet 
transmission errors and launch DoS assaults. Sequence 
number assaults are a typical denial -of-service attack against 
traditional MANET r outing protocols, and they can drop data 
packets during the transmission process after violating 
protocol requirements during the route -finding phase.  As a 
result, it is challenging to provide secure and trustworthy 
routing in such a network. According to their architecture and 
routing method, routing protocols in MANETs can typically 
be divided into three categories: proactive routing protocols, 
reactive routing protocols, and hybrid routing protocols. The 
MANET's most popular reactive routing mechanism  is the ad S.M. Udhaya Sankar et al. / IJETT, 70(11), 219-231, 2022 
 
220 hoc on -demand distance vector routing protocol (AODV)  
[47]. Numerous researchers investigated AODV's 
effectiveness by considering several variables and also 
discovered numerous causes of security breaches. As a result, 
these shortcomings of this pr otocol exist:  
• There is no system in place to deal with congestion and 
packet losses.  
• The current protocol does not support multipath routing . 
• It is susceptible to numerous security attacks.  
• It lacks a predetermined process for dealing with node 
transmission delay.  
• It lacks any safeguards to guarantee service quality.  
• The node' s energy usage is substantial , and there is no 
notion of power optimization.  By developing a secure attack detection and recognition 
that takes into account issues like a safe path to endpoints for 
transmission of data, negligible node energy usage, and the 
innovation of protection schemes that really can come to 
terms with egoistic and harmful attacks on the entire network, 
the security concerns in MA NET can be resolved  [10-15]. 
The assault detection mechanism for the MANET has not yet 
been implemented completely. The Secure attack gesture 
recognition algorithm has a distinct structure and design 
compared to  wired and wireless networks. Because MANET 
lacks a system, node assaults on the networks are unaffected. 
To illustrate the situations for the needs of the safe assault 
detection method, Fig. 1 shows the MANET topology with 
the source and destination nodes, connections in a network, 
and malicious nod es.

221 Path computing and node prevention must both be 
considered by the protocol. The protocols search the network 
for the most accurate and efficient approach to sink nodes. 
While placing nodes on the shortest paths, it must also be 
considered to use the least amount of energy possible [16]. 
The protocols may allow for multiple ways; if one way breaks 
for whatever reason, the data will still be sent to the channel's 
destination via a different path. If dubious nodes have  not 
already been identified in the system , a mechanism must be 
developed to place them there. To defend against various 
attacks and keep malicious node s out of the network's routing 
path, the Secure assault detection method implementations 
promptly update node info [27 -32]. 
Ad hoc On -Demand Dista nce Vector is highly vulnerable 
to numerous assaults, including wormhole s, denial of service, 
and black hole assaults. It is vital to develop a new strategy to 
address these security vulnerabilities  [33-36]. Numerous 
scholars have suggested various variati ons of the AODV 
protocol to address the abovementioned problems. However, 
there are currently no AODV protocols that address all the 
abovementioned problems as a solitary framework. The most 
recent research findings based on the Mobile Ad -Hoc 
Network (MANE T) security aspect have offered various 
elements  [37]. To ensure a high level of safety in packet 
forwarding, current research has focused on specific attacks 
and some approaches that significantly increase 
communication costs. Based on the findings of the  latest 
analysis, the primary  goals were set for creating  the proposed 
methodology with the overarching goal of offering a high 
level of protection to the content in the MANET  [38]. 
• To develop a reliable and secure navigation system that 
tackles issues wit h creating  a secure path among MANET 
nodes.  
• To manage and minimize packet losses.  
• To provide a system that allows nodes to interact with 
one another about data securely . 
• Finding and ultimately stopping the threats in MANET.  
• Improving MANET's level of service quality.  
 
The following parameters for safe routing were taken 
into consideration when developing the SRA procedure in this 
paper:  
• Secure routing using dependable nodes  
• Monitoring Packet Flow.  
• Watching over nearest neighbo urs. 
• Discovery of maliciou s nodes.  
• Separate Attack and Reliable Nodes.  
• Safe routing prolongs network life, boosts throughput, 
uses less energy, and reduces packet loss . 2. Related Work  
Due to its transparency, the changing topology of the 
network, and the absence of centralized con trol and 
monitoring, wireless communication are more vulnerable to 
attacks than wired ones. In wireless connections, security 
concerns are becoming ever more crucial. Some 
considerations should be made when creating an attack node 
detection mechanism for M ANETs. The assault node 
detection techniques for MANETs will function differently 
from their wired equivalents. Some issues must be resolved 
while creating attack node detection techniques for MANETs.  
The characteristics of privacy have been covered in 
several wireless security studies. Numerous studies on 
protected transit in Mobile Ad -Hoc Networks have been done 
throughout the last few generations. Since energy constraints 
and unforeseen events in network activity frequently and 
unpredictably lead to top ological changes, the task of locating 
and conditioning will lead to WSNs is challenging. The 
biggest obstacle is figuring out where the agents are while the 
nodes move . Similarly, the nodes housing the intrusion -
detecting agents need more computing power, connectivity, 
and battery life.  
For the scattered context in mobile ad hoc  networks, 
Filipek and Hudec [15 ] propose a secure structure based on a 
PKI, trust model, firewall (MANETs), and intrusion 
prevention system (IPS). Nodes' L0 through  L3 of privileges 
are defined by their trust level, which can be lowered or 
removed in response to harmful activity. Only the ability to 
obtain the credential is granted to L0 -level nodes. The 
channel's end -to-end connectivity is permitted with L1 -level 
nodes. Nodes at the L2 layer can participate  in distributed, 
IPS, and forwarding. A stand -alone attribution authority (AA) 
called an L3 -level router can accredit other networks and 
develop its environment. Using the AA key pair, each node 
can use the certifi cate's AA signature to confirm its 
authenticity. The suggested architecture uses a gateway as a 
privacy overlay, PKI to impose secrecy and data 
communication standards, and IPS to govern nodes and ensure 
compliance with security protocols (PKI and firewall  rules). 
However, DHT -based connectivity is not taken into account 
by the researchers.  
The RAD protocol w as created by Hamamreh et al. [16 ] 
and utilizes the reinforcing technique, Diffie -Hellman, and 
MD5 for communication security. This method examines 
node behavio ur in the MANET using a learning algorithm. 
This strategy locates and removes the network's harmful 
nodes. The Diffie -Hellman algorithm is employed to share 
private keys amongst some nodes, while MD5 is utilized to 
identify among nodes. This RAD m ethod does not necessitate 
a third party to disseminate secret keys. Additionally, this 
protocol prevents choosing a path containing malicious 
activity.  S.M. Udhaya Sankar et al. / IJETT, 70(11), 219-231, 2022 
 
222 Zarei and Fotohi [ 17] presented a thorough architecture 
for the technology of the IoT's centered on the SDx model. 
The frame included an SD -IoT processor module a nd SD-IoT 
switches connected to an IoT gateway and wirelessly 
Connected devices. Next, a DDoS attack detection and  
mitigation algorithm was developed using the SD -IoT 
platform. To determine whether DDoS attacks have taken 
place in the IoT, the covariance of link layer message speed 
matrices at bordering SD -IoT switch ports has been utilized. 
Not to mention, test resul ts demonstrated that the provided 
method was excellent, and the architecture had been modified 
to improve security in the IoT despite interacting with a range 
of weak devices. The similarity measure function cannot be 
employed for standard levels since it canno t be utilized in 
guided matrices.  
The KEHECCS technique, which employs a signcryption 
approach based on position curve encryption for key lockup, 
was presente d by Vanathy and Ramakrishnan [18 ]. This 
KEHECCS method utilizes the SSKG and GSKG strategies  to 
promote the concept of cooperative key management. While 
GSKG is employed for secure group distribution, SSKG is 
used for private key sharing. These methods are contrasted 
with AES, DES, and ECC ones. The proposed method 
outperforms the currently used DES, AES, and ECC 
algorithms regarding  throughput, processing costs, and 
network latency.  
A solution to prevent wormhole assaults wa s put up by 
Jamali and Fotohi [19 ] using an Artificial Immune System 
(AIS) that can defend against various unrelated assault s while 
compromising the network's  quality. A test package will be 
used and transmitted from every channel, and the target must  
submit a verification packet after obtaining the test package. 
The suggested approach consists of two steps. The packet w ill 
not reach its target, and the verification packet w ill no t be 
received if the path contains wormhole hubs. Wormhole 
attacks typically have fewer hops in phase 2 compared to 
honest nodes. Therefore, the likelihood of pollutants along the 
way would rise when the network load was low. Which is the 
case when the amount of energy of the current nodes along the 
route increases and the overall trip duration is low.  
Chen and Terzis gave research for mobile sensor nodes 
relying on the Log -normal path loss model  in [20 ]. They began 
with the supposition that the signal intensities at close places 
are unrelated if they are gener ally distributed due to the brand 
perfectly. This suggests that locating the place where the 
packet delivery ratio is higher than a predetermined t hreshold 
can be represented as a series of Bernoulli trials. As a result, 
the number of searches necessary to locate a place with a high 
PRR is spatially dispersed. Additionally, they contended that 
the geometrical dispersion is preferable since it lacks l engthy 
tails and that, consequently, the number of searches required 
to identify a suitable site would typically be low, assuming 
that a proper  proportion of locations with high PRR exist nearby. They concentrated on fluctuations in the latent space 
instea d of fluctuations in transmission power in the temporal 
domain. They focused on how the log -normal model for path 
loss affects the deployment and movement of sensor motes.  
 
Because of their decentralized structure and changeable 
archi tecture, Sangeetha and  Kumar [21 ] give data packet 
metrics of mobile nodes in ad hoc architecture that are 
particularly difficult to understand. To understand the 
poisonous motion of the adversary, the current structure has 
implemented several security procedures. Designing a 
strategy to strengthen the interruption location framework in 
light of the adversary's dubious and arbitrary destructive 
behavio ur is a statistically challenging problem. This work 
demonstrates a technique known as ZIDS —Zonal -based 
Intrusion Detection Syste m—which removes the ambiguous 
methods of the malicious node by using the ability to divert 
the premise. ZIDS provides comprehensive protection against 
numerous and discrete aggressors. In contrast to active 
research, ZIDS performs best regarding  geolocatio n accuracy 
and processing time to ensure the correct assessment of 
vengeful nodes and events.  
 
The aggregate machine learning approach can identify 
IoT sensor dangers based on their results, according to a haven 
things design internet that Liu et al. [22] described. The 
support vector technique was chosen in an Internet of Things 
context with the fewest altering hyper -parameters and used to 
detect discriminating assaults. The system utilized a wide 
range of procedures, like detecting attacks, data cleaning,  
convnet, clustering algorithms, and internet -of-things sensing 
devices (IoT sensor networks) to collect internet traffic. First, 
the information size was reduced using the feature extraction 
technique, which enhanced the assault and recognition 
scenario. The sample size was therefore reduced using the 
method for feature selection. Following the prior stage with 
minimal hyper - parameters changing, the aggregate support 
vector technique was used to achieve the best results. The 
model was more effective, as seen by its greater accuracy of 
99.40%, consistency of 99%, and F1 scoring of 99% in 
identifying intrusions on the IoT device's ecosystem. The 
method used throughout the procedure necessitated a more 
fabulous training time.  
 
Acco rding to Sathiya and Gomath y [23 ], an attacker can 
obstruct access to data in MANETs by acting as an access 
point on the route from the origin to the destination. They 
present a novel method by utilizing the Beer -Quiche 
theoretical routing framework . In this approach, the source 
node monitors the accessible path at each phase, the surviving 
bandwidth, and the aggressor policy, collecting the data 
readily accessible by the preceding stage. The data packet 
chooses the best route for packet transmission using this data. 
Additionally, th ey recommend a suitable solenoid valve to 
choose from various ways from the origin to the destination. 
Once more, they do not consider  the WANETs' DHT -based 
routing paradigm.  S.M. Udhaya Sankar et al. / IJETT, 70(11), 219-231, 2022 
 
223 Santhi and Tamilarasi [24] proposed a technique to 
prevent wormhole attacks in MA NET by locating the 
wormhole and choosing the optimum route. Using the Ad -hoc 
on-request Spread spectrum Shortest Path multicast routing, 
various paths between the origin and destination will be 
constructed, named "K." The data packet will then use the 
target's detecting package (DP) and response package  to 
determine the time vortex path. Using the Particle Swarm 
Optimization (PSO) method, the data packet will choose the 
optimal path from the attacking player routes after identifying 
the time portal paths a nd send the data to its destination along 
the correct route.  
According to Chaudhary et al. [26 ], all of the current 
wireless base stations must interact among themselves , self-
efficacy the layout , and start the demand for info multipacks 
to send and receiv e even though portable connections are 
entirely bereft of any preceding structure or confirmation 
point. Security -wise, communication between mobile nodes 
via distant links renders these systems more vulnerable to 
internal or external assault because anybo dy can join and 
relocate the network anytime. After all, is said and done, one 
of the possible attacks in the portable , specially built system is 
a packet -lowering attack through the harmful router. In order 
to identify the transmission -lowering attack from the mobile 
organized platforms and to remove the malicious nodes to 
protect the resources of mobile nodes, this research focused on 
developing an abnormal state framework using fluffy logic.  
In her article titled "A Genetic Algorithm -Based 
Mult ipath routing Strategy fo r Wireless Networks," Wang 
[27] suggests a strategy for navigating sensing devices 
utilizing genetic techniques that improve fault endurance and 
consume less energy for network elements. The numerous 
distance characteristics among varied different types of nodes 
are considered in order to obtain a practical fitness value. The 
range between a transmitter to a receiver and the central node 
is included, the number of hops from the transmitter to a 
receiver to the access point and the n umber of hops from the 
access point to the subsequent hop. A parametric study also 
supports the effectiveness of the strategy. The focus should be 
on privacy since it  is such a crucial problem.  
3. Proposed Methodology  
This part will make a new ad hoc wirel ess strategy with 
effectiveness and safety systems. This system is flexible 
enough to react to actual wireless conditions. A supervising 
flow of packets stands on top of the semi -trusted in the Safe 
Routing Approach (SRA), a two -tiered approach. The 
propos ed work  briefly describe s the SRA's routing process in 
this section, the attacker node identification method, the trust 
model, and the monitoring flow of packets. The Block 
diagram of the Suggested Safe Routing Strategy is shown in 
Fig. 2. (SRA). Our schem e offers confidentially, transparency, 
and versatility for multipath in addition to meeting the 
specifications of earlier methods. Additionally, it provides increased effectiveness to make the communication 
ecosystem  more helpful. 
 
3.1. Supervising the Flow of Packets  
There is no active network midway structure in MANET. 
As a result, numerous attack nodes can readily access the 
channel's topology and disrupt its computing power. The 
source nodes and the destination network are not direct ly 
connected. To exchange the incoming packets with its relay 
node, the originator node sends a request for a route  [39]. The 
packets are sent via the chosen, most efficient path from the 
relay node to the receiver node. An attached node may enter 
the rout e and release the attackers since the path is generated 
on request. An attack known as the transmission delay for 
diversity invaders occurs when a node waits to transmit a 
transmission to the following  nearby node.  
Typically, the development of a reliable link is required 
for functions like data transfer. This link is provided by the 
distribution method, which is based on a trustworthy link and 
requires a response packet within a predetermined amount of 
time for appr opriate data packet transmission. The network 
latency for the diversity invader node prevents this. It displays 
the network latency before communication. The base station 
assumes that the package has not reached the destination node 
since the response pack age does not reach the source network 
in an instance of time, whereby Prob(A) is the package 
connection, Prob(f) is the network stream, and ts seems to be 
the time frame . 
 
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏 (𝐴)=𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏 (𝑓)∗ 𝑡𝑠    (1) 
 
The transmitter node continuously sends the data  packet 
upstream, which can cause the communication network to 
become overloaded. As a small number of data packets are 
ultimately delivered, lowering the delay in packet broadcast 
decreases node effectiveness. This method works by having 
each node forward  for typical broadcasting packets after a 
predetermined time interval and confirming that the nodes are 
transmitted delay for the packet by an instance of time more 
significant than the entrance rate across its relay node. 
Network characteristics like conn ection delay and node 
transmission latency occurrence determine this cutoff valu e. 
Additionally, the max amount of overburden on the path is 
taken into account while thinking about packet delay, where 
Sz(Pkt) is the length of the package, Curn is the preva iling 
node, S(A) is the self -association of the packet, and An is the 
hidden terminal detection.

225 When an attack node is not accessible, the datagram 
transmission occurs on a route with the fewest number of 
nodes possible. Except  when an assault node is discovered on 
the shows the locations, the node next to the assault node does 
not take the intended route; instead, it chooses constructive 
trust, regardless of availability. As a result, the attacker node 
will never enter the transmitting path since it loses the 
confirmati on signal from the assault node [40].  The node 
inside the mobile network is forced  to choose a higher 
sequence number route rather than the routing process , which  
is the shortest range route with the assault node. Performance 
data shows that the transfer rate is higher using the route 
without an attacker node,  and the point -to-point transmission 
delay is reduced. Consequently, the net display improves . 
3.2. Malicious Node Discovery  
The method for determining whether each network device 
is an assault site or not is among the most energy -intensive 
ways, adding latency for  the nodes in the network. Attack 
nodes raise the number of neighbo urs, which improves 
connection and leads to erroneous RTT. Consequently, a 
straightforward method known as the Threshold for 
Neighbo ur Ratio has been utilized (TNR). To find the assault 
networks in MANET, it will check a node's neighbo ur value 
with all of its neighbo urs. The nodes will be aware of their 
neighbo urs using neighbo ur identification operations. The 
nodes then determine the neighbo ur ratio, which is the 
proportion of its neighbo ur number to the mean neighbo ur 
amount of all its neighbo urs.  
As shown below in algorithm 1, in which the complete 
network NW contains nodes N and their neighbo urs set Ns, 
the neighbo ur ratio (Nr) will then be matched with the 
Minimum for Neighbour Ratio to  evaluate if assault node 
identification is necessary or not. Then, to carry out an out -of-
band detection mechanism, nodes with neighbo urhood ratios 
greater than the Threshold for Neighbo ur Ratio would be 
included in the suspicious list  [41]. The cutoff fo r Neighbour 
Ratio's primary objectives is to decrease latency and energy 
costs  while executing assault detection techniques.

  sk = |Sk| (neighbo ur amount of Nk); 
x= 0; 
  x= x+ sk; 
  To determine the average quantity of Nj neighbours  
Then sj = x/sj 
  To discover Nj neighbour ratio TNRj  = sj/sj   
 if   TNRj  > TNR then   set Nj to alleged nodes  - A 
end 
 
The system's penetration is assessed when the optimal 
heads are determined. The next step is to examine these nodes' 
hopeful components from the state's and the target clients' 
perspectives. The suspect's identification has been identified, 
and the infiltr ating node is not  permitted to connect to the 
network. To assess the existence of invaders, the sink node's 
specified limit is employed. The threshold quantity may be 
chosen at the supervisor's choice according to the system's 
needs. The value is typically  0.5J in most instances.  
The remaining power spectrum of a specific node is used 
to calculate a route's transmitting capacity and connectivity 
condition. A node loses access to a system when its power 
level is low because it is less likely to find another  unit nearby. 
However, a node's transmit power might be improved if its 
energy is higher. The fundamental objective of vulnerability 
scanning is to keep a secure communication link while 
consuming minimal energy and sending data as quickly as 
possible . 
Nm indicates how many of the network's nodes are acting 
improperly. The likelihood of malfunctioning the network's 
nodes , therefore,  is provided by:  
 
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏 𝑚=𝑁𝑚
𝑁𝑛     (5) 
where Nn  is the network's total amount of nodes. When 
none of the nodes that make up a route is "misbehaving," the 
path is said to be safe. Let h represent the typical quantity of 
hops on a route. It is possible to calculate the likelihood of 
finding a safe path f rom the origin Sr and target Dt as follows:  
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏 𝑠𝑒𝑐(𝑆𝑟,𝐷𝑡)=(1−𝑁𝑚
𝑁𝑛)ℎ−1
 (6) 
The value of h should be evaluated to understand how the 
quantity of malfunctioning nodes affects the likelihood of 
discovering a s afe route. If h is the mean number of hops in a 
path and d(nda, ndb) is the average length  between two nodes 
within the network. Following that, the following average 
distance is reported among source Sr and destination Dt:  
 
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡 .(𝑆𝑟,𝐷𝑡)=ℎ∗𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡 (𝑛𝑑𝑎,𝑛𝑑𝑏)  (7) 
 
Allow a node's communication range to reach between 
points (ao, bo) and (a, b). The node's and range's transmitting 
circle diameter can be calculated as follows:

Smart adversaries may pose as innocuous nodes by 
transmitting traffic before initiating packet -smashing assaults 
to increase the trust level in nearby nodes. Nevertheless, S.M. Udhaya Sankar et al. / IJETT, 70(11), 219-231, 2022 
 
226 during the route identification process, packet loss attackers 
perform sequence numb er attacks that may produce a 
particular type of pattern in generating some parameter value 
in the datagrams.  
SRA uses a trend -finding approach to examine the 
captured parameter value from the e avesdropped control 
messages . Two sliding windows are used to store the 
parameter value: The target node's identification, present 
moment, node density, and sequence number are all recorded 
in the initial sliding window (SL1), and the target node's 
individuality, current time, and the differential in between 
sequence  number figures of the obtained piece and that of the 
correlating request message are all recorded in the main 
sliding window (SL2).  
The collected data is analyzed by an algorithm using the 
method of the Frequent Variations model, which then 
determines whether the neighbo ur node has any known attack 
patterns . This approach strengthens the route -finding process 
by segregating the prohibited enemies who might 
subsequently execute packet loss assaults  [42-44]. It needs to 
be emphasized. Nevertheless, that att acker node might keep 
dropping packets u ntil the monitoring node has filled all of its 
sliding windows and  determined that they belong on the 
blocklist.  
3.3. Safe and Efficient Routing Protocol  
The proposed method aim s to identify the paths with the 
highest probability of success. The requirement for quick 
reaction programming will also indicate the optimizing 
algorithm's result, and the chosen paths for the computation 
transit in MANETs constitute the solution  [45]. The energy 
remaining in the nodes,  the network's capacity, and the path's 
availability affect how healthy away it is. Consequently, the 
fitness function is an optimizing variable. Using the Fitness 
Function approach to optimize energy consumption, the 
suggested study is highly particular o n the issue of energy 
usage in MANET.  
In multi -hop networks, the fitness function determines  the 
best route from the origin to the destination to conserve 
energy. The fitness function is a method of optimization. 
According to the research's objectives, th e fitness function 
identifies the most crucial element to the optimization process, 
which could be any number of factors  [46]. The fitness factors 
in MANET are typically bandwidth, energy, range, and 
latency. The fitness function employed in this study is a 
component of the SRA algorithm. In the suggested task fitness 
function, the alternate route is optimized in case the main path 
fails or an attack node is detected. The fitness function is 
represented mathematically by the following equation . 
 
𝐹𝑖𝑡=1
3(𝐸𝑔+𝑡𝑝+𝑃𝑐)    (10) 
      =1
∑ 𝑙𝑐𝑏𝑖(𝑎)+𝑏𝑖(𝑖+1)𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑖−1
𝑎−1    (11) 
The nodes of the route are used to calculate Eg, Tp, and 
Pc, representing  energy, capacity, and path connectivity, 
respectively. leni stands for length, and lcbi stands for l ink 
cost. 
4. Performance Analysis  
Utilizing MATLAB R2021b, the performance of the Safe 
Routing Approach (SRA) is evaluated. In terms of Packet 
Delivery Ratio (PDR), network performance, energy usage, 
and recognition of attack nodes, the scheme is contraste d with 
AIS: Artificial Immune System [19], ZIDS: Zone -based 
Intrusion Detection System [21], and Improved AODV [25]. 
By raising the fraction of malicious nodes, the efficiency of a 
net is also evaluated. The experiment's simulation settings are 
displayed i n Tab. 2. Intel Pentium Core i5 with a clock speed 
of 2.8 GHz, 16 GB of RAM, and 64 -bit Windows 8.1 have 
been employed. T he same platform mimics each compared 
procedure  to ensure constant results collecting . To evaluate 
the effectiveness of the proposed me thods, a random sample 
of origin nodes of size varying from 25 to 150 nodes was 
repeated to use the simulation system depicted in Table 1. All 
source nodes were configured to transmit constant bit rate 
(CBR) data packets at arbitrary speeds ranging from 25  m/s 
to 30 m/s. The random waypoint (RWP) technique produces 
various nodes. It takes only 700 s of simulation time to assess 
a network's complexities, delay, and traffic .

4.1. Packet Delivery Rate  
It might be characterised  as the proportion of received 
packets to all packets sent. It contains packets for RREP and 
RREQ. The PDR of the connection ought to be high. A 
network with a high PDR is more trustworthy.

Fig. 3 PDR with changing % of Attack Nodes  
 
Fig. 3 displays a comparison of the proposed strategy 
with existing methods. Because hybrid routing is used in the 
proposed strategy, it can be shown that the packet delivery 
rate is superior to  that of existing methods. The cluster -level 
maintenance of routing tables incre ases the packet delivery 
ratio. Additionally, the shortest path is chosen while choosing 
the route discovery in the suggested method utilising hop 
count, which significantly decreases wait time and hence 
boosts the packet de livery ratio. Th is standard represents the 
level of the proposed method from an origin to a destination . 
The proposed method's effectiveness increases with the 
data packet delivery pace . Let PDR represent the data packet 
delivery performance, which is dete rmined using the 
following formula:  
Packet  Delivery  Rate =Npr
Nps∗100%   (12) 
 
Where N pr is the number of packets received while Nps 
is the number  of packets transmitted.  4.2. Network Throughput  
Network throughput is the proportion of received packets 
at a target. Throughput and PDR might be mixed up. Consider 
a scenario where packets are appended to the cache during the 
early phase owing to wait time. PDR will not be impacted 
because the packages have not yet arrived in the system, but 
bandwidth will be dec reased. However, if packet delivery 
fails twice or more, PDR w ill drop, and there w ill no t be much 
of an impact on capacity.  
 
Fig. 4 compares network bandwidth with AIS, ZIDS, and 
Enhanced AODV. The Safe Routing Approach (SRA) offers 
more efficiency than current methods. SRA is superior 
because it selects an efficient routing strategy while 
maintaining a route's trust level, energy, and hop count. It 
effectively gets rid of broken nodes. The SRA trust factor is 
additionally dynamic. CH is c hosen based on high -quality 
links. SRA has higher throughput than currently used 
methods as a result .

4.3. Energy Consumption  
The total energy network nodes used during the scenario 
are referred to as energy consumption. This is achieved by 
determining each node's energy level  after the experiment and 
considering its residual energy [36 -38]. Econs will stand in 
for en ergy usage, which can be computed as  
 
𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠 =∑ (𝐸𝑖(𝑎)−𝐸𝑟(𝑎))𝐵
𝑎=1    (13)  
Fig. 6 Detecting Attack Nodes with changing % of Attack Nodes  
It is the proportion of the total amount of energy used by 
all nodes to all nodes. Figure 6 displays the typical energy 
used by various numbers of nodes for proposed and existing 
designs. If we assume that a packet requires a fixed amount 
of energy to be t ransmitted, the frequency of communications 
directly affects the network's average energy utilisation . The 
suggested system chooses the shortest path , which lowers the 
number  of transmissions and overall energy usage. 
Additionally, using routing informatio n in clusters will save 
energy that is used to discover routes repeatedly . The 
suggested approaches are AIS: Artificial Immune System 
[19], ZIDS: Zone -based Intrusion Detection System [21], and 
Improved AODV [25], and their energy consumption is 
displayed in Fig. 6. In contrast to existing protocols, which 
employ and over 35 joules for 10 seconds and 95 joules for 
60 seconds, the proposed technique utilizes 31 joules for 10 
seconds and 93 joules for 60 seconds. The proposed technique 
consumes less energy th an several alternative methods.  
 
4.4. Identification of Attack Nodes  
Attack nodes are seeded into the system at varying 
percentages to verify their identification. Several assault 
nodes are visible in Fig. 7 , with variable percentages of 
malicious nodes.  
 
The low influence on trust value is due to the trust 
management function. Because direct trust is based on three 
elements and SRA uses two degrees of criterion, this is the 
case. In addition to this, SRA offers a flexible time. Fig. 7

229 demonstrates that S RA outperforms existing approaches 
concerning  PDR, energy consumption, network speed, and 
attacker node detection. Because the SRA is dynamic and 
senses trust in time slots, it can identify nodes that initially 
displayed appropriat e behaviour to avoid detection. The trust 
value, lowest hop count, and  remaining energy are also 
considered when choosing a route to transport a packet . As a 
result, an effective short way that is also durable is chosen.  
5. Conclusion  
The most common threats and attacks, such as wormhole 
attacks, can affect MANETs. The effic iency of the wireless 
network is undermined, and most routing protocols are 
disrupted by wormhole attacks, which are challenging issues 
that track packets through one spot on the system and route it to another. To identify attackers using various attack pa tterns 
when they start packet -dropping attacks, we developed a novel 
trust-based method called SRA for MANETs. In order to 
improve the effectiveness of activities, the plan aimed to 
segregate the enemies early on. A suggested scheme's 
significance is compa red to existing ones like AIS, ZIDS, and 
Improved AODV regarding Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), 
network throughput, energy usage, and attack node 
identification. The findings demonstrate that the suggested 
design enhanced throughput, average energy use, and PDR.  
Additionally, SRA has a minimal effect o n malicious 
nodes ' trust value. It is , therefore , ideal for a wide range of 
applications. Future SRA modifications will enable it to be 
utilized for IoT -based apps .
