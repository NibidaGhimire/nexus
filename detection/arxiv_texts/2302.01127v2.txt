ABSTRACT
The light-cone (LC) anisotropy arises due to cosmic evolution of the cosmic dawn 21-cm signal along the line-of-sight
(LoS) axis of the observation volume. The LC eﬀect makes the signal statistically non-ergodic along the LoS axis.
The multi-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS) provides an unbiased alternative to the popular 3D power
spectrum as it does not assume statistical ergodicity along every direction in the signal volume. Unlike the 3D power
spectrum which mixes the cosmic evolution of the 21-cm signal along the LoS kmodes, MAPS keeps the evolution
information disentangled. Here we ﬁrst study the impact of diﬀerent underlying physical processes during cosmic
dawn on the behaviour of the 21-cm MAPS using simulations of various diﬀerent scenarios and models. We also make
error predictions in 21-cm MAPS measurements considering only the system noise and cosmic variance for mock
observations of HERA, NenuFAR and SKA-Low. We ﬁnd that 100 h of HERA observations will be able to measure
21-cm MAPS at >3σfor/lscript.1000 with 0 .1 MHz channel-width. The better sensitivity of SKA-Low allows reaching
this sensitivity up to /lscript.3000. Note that due to the diﬀerence in the frequency coverage of the various experiements,
the CD-EoR model considered for NenuFAR is diﬀerent than those used for the HERA and SKA-Low predictions.
Considering NenuFAR with the new model, measurements >2σare possible only for /lscript.600 with 0.2 MHz channel-
width and for a ten times longer observation time of tobs= 1000 h. However, for the range 300 ./lscript.600 and
tobs= 1000 h more than 3 σmeasurements are still possible for NenuFAR when combining consecutive frequency
channels within a 5 MHz band.

1 INTRODUCTION
The study of Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reioniza-
tion (EoR) is very crucial to understand the ﬁrst luminous
objects in our Universe and how they caused the last im-
portant phase change in the inter-galactic medium (IGM)
on cosmological scales. X-ray emission from these ﬁrst ob-
jects (stars, quasars etc.) are expected to heat up the cold
neutral hydrogen atom (H i) during the CD which is then fol-
lowed by UV photo-ionization of H iduring the EoR (see e.g.
Pritchard & Furlanetto 2007; Zaroubi 2013; Shaw et al. 2023,
for reviews). Unfortunately, our current understanding of the
IGM during the EoR is limited to only a few indirect observa-
tions such as the measurements of Thomson scattering optical
depth of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons
⋆E-mail: abinashkumarshaw@gmail.comwith the free electrons (e.g. Planck Collaboration et al. 2020)
and the presence of complete Gunn-Peterson troughs in high-
redshift quasar spectra (e.g. Becker et al. 2001; Fan et al.
2006; Gallerani et al. 2006; Becker et al. 2015). Furthermore,
results from the observations of high-redshift Ly- αemitters
(e.g. Hu et al. 2010; Ota et al. 2017; Ishigaki et al. 2018;
Morales et al. 2021), the Ly- αdamping wings in high-redshift
quasar spectra (e.g. Ba˜ nados et al. 2018; Davies et al. 2018;
Wang et al. 2020; ˇDurovˇ c´ ıkov´ a et al. 2020; Reiman et al. 2020;
Yang et al. 2020; Greig et al. 2022), Lyman break galaxies
(Mason et al. 2018; Hoag et al. 2019; Naidu et al. 2020), the
measurements of the eﬀective optical depth of the Ly- α(and
Ly-β) forests (e.g. McGreer et al. 2014; Kulkarni et al. 2019;
Raste et al. 2021; Zhu et al. 2021, 2022) and the high- zLy-
αemitters clustering masurements (e.g. Faisst et al. 2014;
Santos et al. 2016; Sobacchi & Mesinger 2015; Wold et al.
2022) have put some loose bounds on the average H ifrac-

tion in the IGM. These indirect observations in combination
suggest a bound on the timing of reionization to be between
z≈5.5−12 (e.g. Robertson et al. 2015; Mitra et al. 2018;
Dai et al. 2019; Qin et al. 2021). Besides the ionization state,
there have been attempts to constrain IGM temperature and
photoionization rates using Ly- αforests observations (Gaik-
wad et al. 2020). However these constraints are not very tight
and a direct probe of the IGM is required to answer several
fundamental questions regarding CD-EoR such as what is the
exact duration of these epochs, how the heating and reion-
ization have progressed, what were the sources involved and
what were their properties.
The most promising direct probe to the CD-EoR is the
redshifted 21-cm radiation which is emitted due to hyper-
ﬁne transition of H iin the IGM (e.g. Wouthuysen 1952;
Field 1958; Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1972; Hogan & Rees 1979;
Scott & Rees 1990; Bharadwaj & Sethi 2001). Concerted ef-
forts have been put into observing the brightness tempera-
ture ﬂuctuations of the redshifted 21-cm signal using low fre-
quency radio-interferometers. Several current telescopes, such
as LOFAR1(van Haarlem, M. P. et al. 2013), PAPER2(Par-
sons et al. 2010), NenuFAR3(Zarka et al. 2018), uGMRT4
(Swarup et al. 1991; Gupta et al. 2017), MWA5(Tingay et al.
2013), HERA6(DeBoer et al. 2017) are trying to measure the
redshifted 21-cm signal statistically.
Despite these eﬀorts, the 21-cm signal has not yet been
measured due to several observational challenges. The cosmo-
logical 21-cm signal is 104−105times weaker than the galactic
and extra-galactic foregrounds (e.g. Ali et al. 2008; Bernardi
et al. 2009; Bernardi, G. et al. 2010; Ghosh et al. 2012; Beard-
sley et al. 2016). In addition, the system noise, systematics
and calibration errors and the human-made radio-frequency
interference poses a challenge to the direct detection of the
CD-EoR 21-cm signal . However, recent improvements in
the foreground mitigation methods (e.g. Datta et al. 2010;
Mertens et al. 2018; Hothi et al. 2020) and calibration tech-
niques (e.g. Kern et al. 2019; Mevius et al. 2021; Gan, H.
et al. 2023) have led us to useful upper limits on spherically-
averaged 3D power spectrum (e.g. LOFAR: Patil et al. 2017;
Gehlot et al. 2019; Mertens et al. 2020; GMRT: Paciga et al.
2011, 2013; MWA: Li et al. 2019; Trott et al. 2020; PA-
PER: Cheng et al. 2018; Kolopanis et al. 2019; HERA: Ab-
durashidova et al. 2022; The HERA Collaboration et al. 2022;
OVRO-LWA: Eastwood et al. 2019). Despite these challenges,
the upper limits are constantly improving and a few recent
upper limits have started ruling out extreme models of the
high-zIGM (e.g. LOFAR: Ghara et al. 2020; Greig et al.
2020b; Mondal et al. 2020b; MWA: Greig et al. 2020a; Ghara
et al. 2021; HERA: Abdurashidova et al. 2022; The HERA
Collaboration et al. 2022). The upcoming SKA-Low7is ex-
pected to measure the 21-cm 3D power spectrum from both
CD and EoR within about a hundred hours of observing time
(e.g. Koopmans et al. 2014; Shaw et al. 2019). SKA-Low will
also be able to produce images of 21-cm signals during CD

thousand hours of observing time.
These radio-interferometric observations record the 3D dis-
tribution of the H i21-cm signal, where the third direction in
the data volume is constructed from several channels across
the frequency bandwidth. The 21-cm signal measured at dif-
ferent frequencies corresponds to the signal originating at dif-
ferent redshifts and thereby at diﬀerent cosmic times. Thus,
the imprint of cosmic evolution in the data makes the ob-
served 21-cm signal statistically non-ergodic along the fre-
quency axis. This eﬀect, also known as the ‘light-cone (LC)
eﬀect’ is inevitable in any line-intensity mapping observa-
tions. Barkana & Loeb (2006) were the ﬁrst to analytically
quantify the line-of-sight (LoS) anisotropy introduced in the
EoR 21-cm signal due to the LC eﬀect. The LC eﬀect also
biases the statistical estimators which assume statistical er-
godicity and periodicity in the data in all directions such
as 3D N-point correlation functions and their Fourier con-
jugates. Several studies have quantiﬁed the LC eﬀect on the
two-point correlations (Zawada et al. 2014) and the 3D power
spectrum (e.g. Datta et al. 2012; Plante et al. 2014; Datta
et al. 2014) using the numerically simulated EoR 21-cm sig-
nal. Datta et al. (2012) found that the eﬀect is about 50 % on
scales corresponding to k= 0.08 Mpc−1along the LoS. Datta
et al. (2014) found that the LC eﬀect shows dramatic changes
in 3D power spectrum only during the initial (¯ xHi≈0.2) and
ﬁnal (¯xHi≈0.8) stages of their ﬁducial reionization model.
However, they also argue that impact would be more impor-
tant for shorter reionization histories. Ghara et al. (2015b) are
the ﬁrst to study the eﬀect of LC anisotropy on CD 21-cm 3D
power spectra. They concluded that the LC eﬀects are im-
portant for the CD 21-cm signal which is mostly governed by
the spin temperature ﬂuctuations that in turn are controlled
by inhomogeneous X-ray heating and the Ly- αcoupling of
the IGM. They reported suppression(enhancement) in the
peaks(dips) by factors >0.6(2.0) for their ﬁducial model at
large-scales ( k≈0.05 Mpc−1) using simulated LC boxes hav-
ing volume V= [200h−1Mpc]3. Unlike during the EoR, the
LC bias becomes dramatically important during CD, even at
small-scales ( k∼1 Mpc−1).
Recently, Mondal et al. (2017b) have proposed the use of
Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum (MAPS) to evade
the issue of the LC eﬀect in the EoR 21-cm signal while quan-
tifying its two-point statistics. Unlike the 3D power spectrum,
MAPS is a non-stationary estimator along the LoS axis that
captures the two-point statistics without any bias originat-
ing due to LC anisotropy in the observed signal. MAPS also
has potential to recover the evolution of EoR (Mondal et al.
2019). Later, Mondal et al. (2020a) have quantiﬁed the EoR
21-cm MAPS and predicted its detectability in context of
future SKA-Low observations. Recently Trott et al. (2022)
have produced ﬁrst upper limits on the EoR 21-cm MAPS
withinz= 6.2−7.5 using the MWA data. MAPS statistics
is expected to contain more unbiased information of the 21-
cm signal than 3D power spectrum. This extra information
can be exploited to put more stringent constraints over the
models of CD-EoR (Mondal et al. 2022). Along a similar line,
this work focuses on estimating the CD 21-cm MAPS using a
suite of CD-EoR 21-cm simulations. We aim to predict the de-
tectability of CD 21-cm MAPS using several current (HERA,
NenuFAR) and upcoming (SKA-Low) telescopes. Unlike re-
cent works which were limited to estimating the EoR 21-

cm MAPS within a small frequency bandwidth (LoS depth
.1 Gpc), here we have computed 21-cm MAPS over a large
frequency bandwidth (LoS depth ≈2.1 Gpc; redshift range
z≈6−19) that comprises both the CD and EoR.
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2
brieﬂy describes the simulation methodology, the impact of
LC eﬀect on CD-EoR 21-cm 3D power spectrum and the
formulation and implementation of the MAPS statistics. We
then discuss the theoretical implications of diﬀerent physi-
cal processes and source models on 21-cm MAPS in Section
3. In Section 4, we discuss the detectability of the CD-EoR
21-cm MAPS considering HERA, NenuFAR and SKA-Low
telescopes. Finally, we summarize our work and conclude in
Section 5. This work uses the cosmological parameter values
Ωm= 0.27, Ω Λ= 0.73, Ω B= 0.044 andh= 0.7 taken from
Hinshaw et al. (2013). These parameters have been used in
theN-body simulation for this work.
2 METHODOLOGY
We ﬁrst brieﬂy describe our LC simulations in this section.
Next, we study the impact of the LC eﬀect on the 3D power
spectrum estimator using our LC simulation. Finally, we de-
scribe the machinery of multifrequency angular power spec-
trum after motivating it as an alternative to the 3D power
spectrum.
2.1 Simulating the 21-cm signal Light-cone
We use the grizzly code (Ghara et al. 2015a, 2018) to sim-
ulate 21-cm signal coeval cubes at diﬀerent redshifts during
the CD and EoR. This code is based on a one-dimensional
radiative transfer method which takes the cosmological den-
sity and velocity ﬁelds and the halo catalogues as input to
simulate the diﬀerential brightness temperature ( δTb) coeval
cubes of the 21-cm signal for a source model. Later, we use
these coeval δTbcubes to generate a δTblight-cone that spans
the CD and EoR. Here, we brieﬂy describe the steps employed
to generate the 21-cm signal light-cones which we will use in
this study.
The cosmological density and velocity ﬁelds and the halo
catalogues, used in this study, are taken from results of the
PRACE8project PRACE4LOFAR. These inputs are from
a dark-matter only N-body simulation that was run using
the code cubep3m9(Harnois-D´ eraps et al. 2013). Here, we
use gridded density and velocity ﬁelds in 3D comoving cubes
with length 500 h−1comoving megaparsec (Mpc) (see e.g,
Dixon et al. 2015; Giri et al. 2019). The volume is gridded
into 3003cubical voxels. We use 59 snapshots in the redshift
range 20 &z&6.5 in equal time steps of 11 .4 Myr. The dark
matter halos were identiﬁed using a spherical overdensity halo
ﬁnder (Watson et al. 2013). The minimum mass of the dark
matter halos is∼109M⊙, having at least≈25 dark matter
particles.
The source model used in this study assumes that each
dark matter halo with mass larger than 109M⊙hosts sources

prace-ri.eu/
9http://wiki.cita.utoronto.ca/mediawiki/index.php/CubePMwhich emit UV as well as X-rays. In particular, we con-
sider a combination of galaxy and mini-quasar type sources.
We assume that the stellar mass of a galaxy ( M⋆) is lin-
early proportional to the host dark matter halo mass Mhalo,
i.e.,M⋆=f⋆/parenleftbigΩB
Ωm/parenrightbig
Mhalo. The quantity f⋆is the fraction of
baryons residing in stars within a galaxy. We ﬁx f⋆= 0.02
in this study (Behroozi & Silk 2015; Sun & Furlanetto 2016).
grizzly also uses a galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED)
per stellar mass in the 1D radiative transfer step. The galaxy
SED per stellar mass is generated for standard star forma-
tion scenarios using the code pegase210(Fioc & Rocca-
Volmerange 1997). The initial mass function (IMF) of the
stars, within the mass range 1 −100 M⊙in the galaxies, is
assumed as a Salpeter IMF and the galaxy metallicity is as-
sumed to be 0 .1Z⊙throughout the EoR. The emission rate
of ionizing photons per unit stellar mass ˙Nifrom a halo is
controlled by the ionization eﬃciency ( ζ) parameter used in
grizzly .˙Ni=ζ×2.85×1045s−1M−1
⊙whereζ= 1 corre-
sponds to ˙Niofpegase2 SED per stellar mass. We ﬁx ζ= 0.1
for all the reionization models considered in this study. This
results in EoR ending around z≈6.5. On the other hand, the
emission rate of X-ray photons per unit stellar mass ˙NXfrom
a halo is controlled by X-ray heating eﬃciency parameter fX,
where ˙NX=fX×1042s−1M−1
⊙. The value of ˙NXforfX= 1 is
consistent with the measurements of 0 .5−8 keV band HMXBs
SEDs in local star-forming galaxies (Mineo et al. 2012). The
X-ray SED of the source is modelled using a power-law of
energyEasIX(E)∝E−α. We ﬁx the spectral index α= 1.2
throughout the work (Berk et al. 2001; Vignali et al. 2003).
The X-ray band here spans from 0 .1 to 10 keV. We vary fX
parameters to model diﬀerent heating (or Cosmic Dawn) sce-
narios of the IGM. The details of the SEDs can be found in
Ghara et al. (2015a) and Islam et al. (2019).
Subsequently, we create a library of a large number of one-
dimensional proﬁles of hydrogen ionization fraction xHii, and
gas temperature TKaround isolated sources for diﬀerent com-
binations of stellar masses, redshifts and density contrast. We
use these proﬁles to generate coeval cubes of neutral fraction
xHiandTKat diﬀerent redshifts. The 21-cm signal strength
also crucially depends on the Ly- αphotons ﬂux. The Ly- α
ﬂux maps are generated assuming a 1 /R2decrease of the Ly- α
photons ﬂux with radial distance Rfrom the source. We refer
the readers to Ghara et al. (2015a) and Islam et al. (2019) for
more details about these calculations. The TKcubes and the
Ly-αﬂux maps are used to generate the spin temperature Ts
maps assuming that the collisional coupling is negligible at
the concerned redshifts. These xHi,Tscubes and the density
ﬁelds are then used to generate the brightness temperature
maps of the 21-cm signal (see e.g., Madau et al. 1997; Furlan-
etto et al. 2006).

CMB brightness temperature is Tγ(z) = 2.725×(1+z) K. We
then incorporate the eﬀect due to the peculiar velocity of the
gas using the cell movement method described by Mao et al.
(2012). Finally, we used these coeval cubes of the 21-cm signal
brightness temperature to create the LC which accounts for
the evolution of the 21-cm signal with redshift. The detailed
method to implement the LC eﬀect can be found in Ghara
et al. (2015b).
We choose fX= 10 for our ﬁducial model as it produces
heating and reionization peaks in 21-cm 3D power spectra
(see Fig. 3) within the redshift range considered here that is
comparable to the earlier studies (e.g. Mesinger et al. 2013).
The CD for this model starts with a weak signal due to weak
Ly-αbackground around z∼20 (see the bottom panel of
Fig. 1). With the Ly- αcoupling becoming eﬃcient at z.
13, X-ray heating dominates the ﬂuctuations of the signal at
9.z.15. Atz.9, the signal ﬂuctuation is dominated by
ionization ﬂuctuation.
The most important physical processes that determine the
strength and ﬂuctuations of the simulated 21-cm signal are
the Ly-αcoupling, X-ray heating and the ionization due toTable 1. An overview of the diﬀerent CD-EoR models and heating
scenarios considered in this paper.

Figure 2. Light-cone slices of simulated CD-EoR 21-cm signal as a function of observing frequency(redshift). The three panels corresponds
to three diﬀerent heating scenarios corresponding to model M3. The details are mentioned in section 2.1.
•Model 1: Considers saturated X-ray heating and Ly- α
coupling from the very beginning of the CD (here z>20). In
other words, we assume Ts>> Tγ. Thus the ﬂuctuations in
the signal are determined by the density ﬂuctuations (impor-
tant during the early stages of reionization) and ionization
ﬂuctuations (important during the later stages of reioniza-
tion). We label this model as ‘M1’ .
•Model 2: Considers X-ray heating self-consistently while
assuming the Ly- αcoupling is strong from the beginning of
the CD. This sets Ts=TKandδTbis predominantly governed
by matter ﬂuctuations initially. As soon as X-rays start heat-
ing the IGM, δTbstarts being governed by the ﬂuctuations
inTs. Thus, we will be able to distinguish the impact of the
X-ray heating on the 21-cm MAPS by comparing this model
with M1. In this simulation we set fX= 10. We denote this
model by ‘M2- fX10’ in our following discussions.
•Model 3: The standard scenario with self-consistent Ly- α
coupling and X-ray heating with fX= 10. This is our ﬁducial
model which we denote by ‘M3- fX10’ .
We also study the impact of diﬀerent X-ray heating scenar-ios on the CD 21-cm MAPS. Thus, for Model 3, we consider
two other heating scenarios correspond to fX= 1 (M3-fX1)
andfX= 0.1 (M3-fX0.1). Fig. 2 shows the light-cones of
these two heating scenarios in addition to our ﬁducial model
M3-fX10. As expected, we note that the X-ray heating of
IGM is delayed for a smaller value of fX. In fact, the frac-
tion of emission regions for fX= 0.1 is negligible. Table 2.1
lists all the diﬀerent CD source models and X-ray heating
scenarios that have been considered in this work.
2.2 Light-cone eﬀect on 3D power spectrum
The 3D power spectrum of the CD-EoR 21-cm signal at any
wavenumber kcan be written as
P(k,z) =V−1/angbracketleftδ˜Tb(k,z)δ˜Tb(−k,z)/angbracketright, (2)
whereVis the signal volume centered at redshift zand/angbracketleft···/angbracketright

transformation of the 3D signal δTb(n,z) centered at red-
shiftzwhich inherently assumes statistical ergodicity and
periodicity in the signal volume along all directions. Using

eq. (2), we estimate 3D power spectrum of the LC 21-cm sig-

cal bins. The solid lines in the top sub-panels of Fig. 3 show
the dimensionless 3D power spectrum ∆2

computed from the LC boxes shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Here we
use a cubical box of volume V= [500h−1Mpc]3, centered at
desired redshifts (frequency channels) within the LC cube, to
obtain ∆2
b,LC(k,z). We also estimate ∆2
b,CC(k,z) from coeval
cubes of similar volume simulated at redshifts the same as
the chosen central redshifts in the LC signal. The evolution

We present the results for large ( k= 0.148 Mpc−1) and small
(k= 1.101 Mpc−1) length-scales, respectively, in the left and
right panels. It is important to note that the LC eﬀect tries
to ﬂatten the peaks and troughs in the 3D power spectrum
due to smoothing as already demonstrated in previous stud-
ies (e.g., Datta et al. 2012; Plante et al. 2014; Ghara et al.
2015b; Mondal et al. 2017b). The impact of LC eﬀect is more
pronounced at smaller kmodes since the cosmic evolution
becomes important on the large length-scales along LoS. We
also plot the percentage deviations in 3D power spectrum due
to LC eﬀect, i.e.δLC(%) = (∆2
b,CC/∆2
b,LC−1)×100%.
Considering model M1 (blue lines) in Fig. 3 where X-
ray heating is saturated and the signal is driven mainly by
the photo-ionization, we note that the deviation δLClies
mostly within±10%, except between z= 9.5−12.5 for
k= 0.148 Mpc−1whereδLCis as large as−60% atz≈11.
Our results for M1 are qualitatively similar to the earlier
LC studies of EoR (e.g. Datta et al. 2012; Plante et al.
2014; Datta et al. 2014; Mondal et al. 2017b) which demon-strate that the LC eﬀects are important but not as dra-
matic as we ﬁnd it. The LC eﬀect is volume-dependent and
becomes more(less) pronounced for larger(smaller) volumes.
Our choice of such a large volume ( ≈40 MHz along LoS) is
motivated by the future large-bandwidth surveys by HERA
and SKA-Low. The impact of LC eﬀects and δLCfor M3-
fX0.1 (green lines) are also similar to M1 as the X-ray heating
here is ineﬃcient ( fX= 0.1). For the more eﬃcient heating
(fX= 1) scenario M3- fX1, we ﬁnd that LC eﬀect somewhat
enhancesδLC. We ﬁnd that for M3- fX1 the clumps of cold
Histill remain in the IGM (see Fig. 2) where the 21-cm signal
is being controlled by the X-ray heating, this allows the devi-
ations to remain important up to z= 7. The dramatic eﬀect
of LC anisotropy on ∆2
b(z) due to X-ray heating is clearly
seen for M2- fX10 (orange lines) and M3- fX10 (black lines)
wherefX= 10. We note that the distinct X-ray peak in co-
eval ∆2
b(z) (dashed lines) is completely ﬂattened due to LC
smoothing. Additionally, a peak appears in the coeval ∆2
b(z)
during the initial stages of the CD ( z&18) due to ﬂuctua-
tions arising from unsaturated Ly- αcoupling. This peak can
also get smoothed out in the LC 3D power spectrum. How-
ever we could not compute the LC 3D power spectrum due
to the limited redshift range of the available LC cube, and
thus the peak is not shown in Fig. 3. The deviations here are
varying roughly within a range of −95% to +88 % and the
large deviations are limited to CD and very initial phase of
EoR. The LC eﬀects dies down as soon as IGM temperature
gets saturated over Tγ(z <8). Note that, our calculations
of the 3D PS also includes the pure LoS kmodes as well, i.e.
when k⊥= 0, which is not the case in real observations where
k⊥= 0 modes are absent. Therefore, the deviations reported
above represents a ceiling for the δLC(%) expected from the
observations. However, removing k⊥= 0 from our analysis
does not change the ﬁnal conclusions and they qualitatively
agree with the previous study by Ghara et al. (2015b) which
concludes that the LC eﬀects can not be ignored for the 21-
cm signal during CD.
2.3 Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum
This work aims to quantify the CD-EoR 21-cm signal using
power spectrum statistics while considering the inevitable LC
eﬀect that makes the signal non-ergodic and aperiodic along
the LoS direction. The 3D Fourier modes k, therefore, will be
an inappropriate choice of basis and the widely used 3D power
spectrum ∆2
b(k,z) will provide biased estimates of the signal
δTb(n,ν). This restricts utility of the 3D power spectrum
estimator to analyzing data in chunks of small bandwidths,
thereby limiting access to the large-scale modes along the
LoS axis. Moreover, the inference pipelines which compares
the 3D power spectra computed from the observed data and
coeval 21-cm signal simulations are expected to bias the resul-
tant parametes. In order to claim a fair comparison between
simulations and observations, one can properly incorporate
the LC eﬀect in inference pipelines. Intuitively one can claim
that this approach will avoid the bias in the parameters. How-
ever, including the LC eﬀects in the modelling does not rectify
the fact that the 3D power spctrum assumes ergodicity along
the LoS axis. Thus, the 3D power spectrum is still the in-
correct basis for parameter exploration and can still bias the
inferred parameter values. One needs to check these claims
for the CD-EoR 21-cm signal. The multi-frequency angular
MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2023)Cosmic Dawn 21-cm MAPS 7
power spectrum (MAPS) is a non-stationary two-point statis-
tics which is a suitable alternative for the 3D power spectrum.
MAPS, which by deﬁnition relaxes the assumption of statis-
tical homogeneity and periodicity along the LoS axis, can
completely quantify the two-point statistics of the CD-EoR
21-cm signal observed across a large frequency bandwidth.
In general, MAPS is deﬁned by correlating the amplitudes
of the orthonormal spherical harmonics Ym
/lscript(n) at diﬀerent
observing frequencies (redshifts), after decomposing the sig-
nal in a spherical basis set (see eq. 4 of Mondal et al. 2020a)
deﬁned on the spherical sky-surfaces corresponding to these
frequencies. This decomposition only assumes the signal to
be statistically homogeneous and periodic on the spherical
sky-surface.
This study further considers the signal to be coming from
a small patch in the sky which allows us to work in ﬂat-sky
regime where the CD-EoR 21-cm signal can be represented
byδTb(θ,ν) withθbeing 2D vector on the ﬂat-sky plane.
Here we use the 2D Fourier transform δ˜Tb2(U,ν) of the sig-
nalδTb(θ,ν), where U(a.k.a. baseline vector) is the Fourier
conjugate of θ. We can also write U=k⊥/rνunder the ﬂat-
sky assumption, where k⊥is the component of kperpendic-
ular to the LoS direction and rνis the comoving distance to
the observing frequency. δ˜Tb2(U,ν) is the primary observed
entity of the radio-interferometric observations which can be
directly used to compute MAPS without any further process-
ing of the observed signal. Using the ﬂat sky approximation,
we can deﬁne MAPS as
C/lscript(ν1,ν2) = Ω−1/angbracketleftδ˜Tb2(U,ν1)δ˜Tb2(−U,ν2)/angbracketright, (3)
where/lscript= 2π|U|and Ω is the solid angle subtended by the
observed (or simulated) sky-patch to the observer. Note that
the statistical ergodicity on the sky-patch allows the signal
to correlate only at the same baselines U. MAPS does not
loose any two-point information if the CD-EoR signal is sta-
tistically isotropic on the sky plane. If the signal δTb(θ,ν)
were statistically homogeneous and periodic along the LoS
axis, then eq. (3) would have been a function of distance sep-
aration along the LoS axis instead of ν1andν2separately.
Considering a LC box with typically ∼300×300×900
voxels, it will be computationally intractable to store MAPS
estimates at each and every combination of cells. Also in-
dividual estimates will be too noisy due to statistical ﬂuc-
tuations. In order to circumvent these issues, we compute
binned-averaged MAPS by averaging over estimates within a
circular bin on /lscriptplane. We deﬁne the binned MAPS estimator
for anyi-th bin as,
ˆC/lscripti(ν1,ν2) =1
2Ω/summationdisplay
Ugiwgi[δ˜Tb2(Ugi,ν1)δ˜Tb2(−Ugi,ν2)
+δ˜Tb2(Ugi,ν2)δ˜Tb2(−Ugi,ν1)],
(4)
where the summation is over all the cells Ugiin thei-th bin
andwgi≡w(Ugi) denotes the weight corresponding to each
cell. The two terms on the right side of eq. (4) and the factor
1/2 appear because of the symmetry C/lscript(ν1,ν2) =C/lscript(ν2,ν1).
Also note that the weight wgi, in general, can be a function of
the two frequencies ( ν1,ν2) as well. In order to compute the
bin-averaged MAPS ¯C/lscript(ν1,ν2), we should perform ensemble
average of eq. (4), i.e.¯C/lscripti(ν1,ν2)≡/angbracketleftˆC/lscripti(ν1,ν2)/angbracketright. However, inthis work, we only have single realization of the 21-cm signal
which we use to compute ¯C/lscripti(ν1,ν2).
In this work, we use a modiﬁed version of the publicly avail-
able MAPS code11which has been used in previous works
(Mondal et al. 2018, 2019; Mondal et al. 2020a). We now
motivate and describe the modiﬁcations implemented in the
existing code. The LC boxes, mentioned in section 2.1, are
created by stacking the slices of similar dimensions (in the
transverse plane) from the coeval boxes. The LC boxes, thus
created, subtend diﬀerent solid angles at the observer in dif-
ferent channels for being located at a diﬀerent LoS distances.
The nearest slice subtends the largest solid angle and vice-
versa. Similarly, the size of each cell on diﬀerent slices will
be scaled accordingly as the number of cells per slice is ﬁxed.
This, in turn, produces baseline planes whose extent Umax
and the cell size ∆ Uwill vary along the frequency axis. The
current available version of code ignores the variation in LoS
comoving distance across the frequency band of the LC boxes.
It considers only one comoving distance, corresponding to
the central frequency of the LC box, while performing the
2D Fourier transform to obtain δ˜Tb2(Ug,ν) fromδTb(θ,ν).
Afterwards, it correlates δ˜Tb2(Ug,ν) at the same cells in dif-
ferent frequency channels to compute C/lscript(ν1,ν2). This approx-
imation is fair only when the frequency diﬀerence |ν1−ν2|
is suﬃciently small (e.g. Mondal et al. 2019; Mondal et al.
2020a). In general, the value Ugicorresponding to any par-
ticulari-th cell will be diﬀerent for two diﬀerent frequency
channels and therefore the correlation will not provide the
estimate of MAPS.
We have modiﬁed the existing version of code to resolve
this issue by properly treating the variation in LoS distance
across the frequency bandwidth of our simulations. The mod-
iﬁcations can be listed under the following points.
•We ﬁrst perform 2D Fourier transforms for every slice to
obtainδ˜Tb2(Ug,ν) at the respective frequency channel.
•We next deﬁne a common gridded uvplane whose extent
and the cell size remains uniform across diﬀerent frequency
channels. In this case, the extent Umaxis set by the maximum
baseline cell of the nearest slice (smallest redshift) of the LC
box as it is the least. The maximum values of the baseline
cells increases with the LoS distance. We also ﬁx the cell
size of this common uvplane to be the same as that of the
farthest frequency slice which is the largest cell size among
all frequency channels.
•We now interpolate δ˜Tb2(Ug,ν) from the frequency
varyinguvplanes to the common uvplane following the near-
est cell method.
•Finally we correlate the interpolated δ˜Tb2(Ug,ν) on the
cells of the common uvplanes across the frequency channels
to estimateC/lscript(ν1,ν2).
Note that all the results shown in the following sections
have been estimated following the modiﬁcations listed above.
3 ASTROPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS
We compute ¯C/lscripti(ν1,ν2) for the LC boxes simulated using
methodology described in section 2.3. Here, we consider the
11https://github.com/rajeshmondal18/MAPS
MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2023)8A. K. Shaw et al.
accessible/lscript-plane by dividing it into 10 log-spaced circular
bins, for which we compute the bin-averaged MAPS (eq. 4).
Note that we do not perform additional binning of our MAPS
estimator along the frequency axis in this paper to retain the
evolution information of the signal. However, one can always
do channel averaging to reduce the noise in the estimates at
the cost of smearing out small-scale information along the
LoS axis.
3.1 Impact of astrophysical processes
Fig. 4 shows the scaled bin-averaged MAPS D/lscript(ν1,ν2) =
/lscript(/lscript+ 1)¯C/lscript(ν1,ν2)/(2π) for the three diﬀerent models (in dif-
ferent columns) considered here (see Fig. 1). The two rows
in this ﬁgure corresponds to the two /lscriptbins having mean val-
ues/lscript= 343 and 1393 which corresponds to respectively large
(63/prime) and intermediate (15 .5/prime) angular-scales on the sky. Here,
we show only a part of the MAPS on ( ν1,ν2) plane which are
within 300 channel grid diﬀerence that roughly corresponds
to 37 MHz band in frequency. This has to do with the cre-
ation of the LC boxes where we simulate signal over ∼900
frequency-grids by repeating slices from the coeval boxes hav-
ing [3003] voxels.
We ﬁrst note that D/lscript(ν1,ν2) can have both positive and
negative values as the signal from diﬀerent parts in the ob-
servation volume can correlate and anti-correlate. The oﬀ-
diagonal terms contains the information of the LC evolution
of the signal as they are the correlations between diﬀerent the
frequency channels. However, the diagonal MAPS D(ν,ν) is
always positive and equivalent to 3DPS estimated on k/bardbl= 0
plane. Considering M1 where the IGM is heated well above
CMB temperature and Ts>> Tγ, we ﬁnd from eq. (1) that
the 21-cm signal δTbis governed by the photo-ionization xHi
during EoR and by density ﬂuctuations δBduring CD. This,
in turn, makes the amplitude of contrast in δTb(see Fig. 1),
and hence the MAPS, small as seen in the panels of Fig.
4. The MAPS estimates in M1 are roughly 50 −100 times
smaller than the other two models. In contrast with M1, we
note that the spin-temperature ﬂuctuations due to unsatu-
rated X-ray heating introduces larger ﬂuctuations in δTbfor
M2-fX10 and M3- fX10 (see Fig. 1). This boost the MAPS
for M2-fX10 roughly 50−100 times over that in model M1
during the CD. The X-ray heating also makes D/lscript(ν1,ν2) pos-
itive in a larger region around diagonal ( ν1=ν2) during the
heating epoch, i.e.between 100−130 MHz. This happens be-
cause of the heating bubbles which have been grown to a large
enough size before the reionization starts. Before the heating
(ν < 100 MHz), MAPS for M1 and M2- fX10 have similar
pattern, however the values are an order of magnitude diﬀer-
ent. Considering model M3- fX10, we ﬁnd the 21-cm MAPS
to be the same as that for M2- fX10 except for the early stages
of CD (ν < 80 MHz). This is because the unsaturated Ly-
αcoupling in M3- fX10 fails to completely couple Tsto the
gas temperature and δTbstarts near to the zero value during
the initial stages of CD. This makes the 21-cm signal and its
MAPS weaker for M3- fX10 than in M2- fX10. The amplitude
of the 21-cm signal and thus its MAPS starts decreasing as
soon as the X-ray heating puts Ts>> Tγatν&140 MHz.
The signal overall remains positive during EoR (as shown by
bluish-green color) on large-scales (small /lscript) for all the three
models considered here. We note that saturated heating of
the IGM decreases the 21-cm MAPS by ∼2 orders of mag-nitudes (see Figs. 3 and 7) as compared to the CD for both
M2-fX10 and M3- fX10.
Comparing the top ( /lscript= 343) and the bottom ( /lscript= 1393)
rows of Fig. 4, we note that the pattern corresponding to
each model are roughly identical on the large and interme-
diate angular-scales respectively. We ﬁnd that for /lscript= 343,
the regions of positive/negative D/lscript(ν1,ν2) are extended to
larger patches on the frequency plane suggesting that the
(anti-)correlation between the signal on large-scales does not
change rapidly over time. Whereas on small-scales the time-
evolution is expected to be faster thereby making the features
inD/lscript(ν1,ν2) smaller for /lscript= 1393 on frequency plane. We ex-
pect the typical sizes of these contiguous patterns to depend
on the diﬀerent stages of CD-EoR and the physical processes.
Similar to the earlier studies (e.g., Mondal et al. 2020a),
we ﬁnd that the 21-cm MAPS takes larger values along and
around the diagonal on the ( ν1,ν2) plane.D(ν1,ν2) decreases
rapidly to one order of magnitude or even less, as we move
away from diagonal. This is apparent from Fig. 5 which shows
D(ν,ν+ ∆ν) for our ﬁducial model (M3- fX10) as a function
of ∆νfor four diﬀerent ν= 100,120,140 and 160 MHz
corresponding to diﬀerent stages of CD-EoR in four panels.
Diﬀerent colored lines in each panel corresponds to diﬀer-
ent/lscriptvalues. The rate of decrease at any particular scale
(/lscript) depends upon how fast the signal decorrelates with the
frequency separation |∆ν|which in turn depends upon the
progression-speed of the underlying physical processes gov-
erning the signal in the IGM. We note that the rate at
which the signal decorrelates with increasing |∆ν|is slower for
smaller/lscriptvalues and vice-versa. We expect the behaviour of
D(ν,ν+∆ν) to be asymmetrical around ∆ ν= 0 as the astro-
physical processes may not behave symmetrically around any
reference frequency ν. This asymmetry can be more promi-
nent for large-angular scales as can be seen for /lscript= 343 here.
The level of asymmetry in the curves will again be depen-
dent on how fast the physical processes evolves the signal at
the concerned instant of time. In Fig. 6, we show the ratio
D(ν,ν+ ∆ν)/D(ν,ν) as a function of νfor three diﬀerent
values of ∆ν= 0.5,1.0 and 1.5 MHz using solid, dashed and
dotted lines, respectively. Here, we can clearly see the signal
decorrelates at a slower rate wherever X-ray heating deter-
mines the 21-cm signal ( i.e.ν≈100−140 MHz) for both the
/lscriptvalues. The decorrelation of the signal is faster during the
beginning of CD and the EoR. Therefore, we conclude that
a large amount of information of the signal is encoded in the
diagonal element of D(ν1,ν2). However, in principle, one can
also exploit the oﬀ-diagonal terms (at least near around the
diagonal) while interpreting the signal especially when the
X-ray heating is crucial.
Fig. 7 shows the diagonal term D/lscript(ν,ν) against four bins
centered at /lscript= 343,859,1393 and 2239 for the three mod-
els M1, M2- fX10 and M3- fX10. We ﬁnd that the qualita-
tive behaviour is similar to the coeval 3DPS (Fig. 3). This
clearly indicates, while analyzing a large-bandwidth signal,
MAPS shows the evolutionary features more distinctly than
the spherically-averaged 3DPS. However, this comparison is
not so straightforward and fair. The advantage of MAPS over
3DPS completely depends on the way we bin and analyze the
data. For example, computing the 3DPS by dividing the data
into chunks of smaller bandwidths can perform better than
when analyzing it in a larger bandwidth. Although, it does
not change the fact that there will be LC bias in the estimates

due to LoS Fourier transformation. As expected, D/lscript(ν,ν) is
smaller for M1 due to aforementioned reasons. We note that
the 21-cm MAPS ﬁrst decreases as the redshift decreases (or
frequency increases). This shallow decrease is because the ion-
izing radiation wipes out H iresiding only in the high-density
peaks (small-scales) during the initial stages. However, as the
reionization progresses further (towards higher frequencies),
the ﬂuctuations due to ionized and neutral regions starts in-
creasing the 21-cm MAPS after the ﬁrst dip at ν= 120 MHz
as seen in the ﬁgure. D/lscript(ν,ν) reaches its maximum when
the Universe is 50 % ionized around ν= 140−150 MHz.
The 21-cm MAPS drops again towards the larger frequencies
as the reionization proceeds to the end. Considering mod-
els M2-fX10 and M3- fX10, the unsaturated heating during
CD (ν.130 MHz) introduces large ﬂuctuations in spin-
temperature Tsand thereby in the signal. This causes the
21-cm MAPS to increase upto two orders of magnitude in CD
regime, when compared with M1. The 21-cm MAPS peaks at
ν≈110 MHz at all the angular-scales shown here in the four
panels. M2- fX10 and M3- fX10 are nearly identical except for
the very initial stages, i.e. ν <90 MHz. In M3- fX10, the Ly-
αcoupling is not saturated from the beginning, and thus Ts
starts at a temperature near to Tγresulting into small ampli-
tude of ﬂuctuations and consequently smaller values of 21-cm
MAPS. As the IGM evolves (towards higher frequencies), the
Ly-αphotons couple Tsto matter temperature and thereforethe amplitude of the 21-cm signal and its MAPS shows a rise
in M3-fX10. However, in M2- fX10 the Ly-αcoupling is sat-
urated, allowing Ts≈TKfrom the beginning, and therefore
the 21-cm MAPS is dominated by the matter ﬂuctuations and
remains almost constant till a point ( ν≈90 MHz) where the
X-ray heating starts playing important role in modulating Ts.
Note that we have chosen fX= 10 for simulating the 21-cm
signal for M2- fX10 and M3- fX10. However, to simulate the
signal for M1, where the heating of IGM is saturated from the
beginning of the CD ( ν= 70 MHz), we need to choose a larger
value forfX. Therefore, the heating in M2- fX10 and M3-fX10
are comparatively delayed due to which the dip before EoR is
occurring at a later redshift (larger frequency) than M1. Late
heating is also the reason for the mismatch in the value of
D/lscript(ν,ν) during the initial and middle stages ( ν∼150 MHz)
of reionization. However towards the end of the reionization
the heating of IGM is saturated as expected, which in turn
causes the MAPS for all the three models to converge. Note
that we treat M3- fX10 as our ﬁducial model in the rest of
this work as this model is closer to realistic scenario based on
current theoretical understanding.

which showsD/lscript(ν1,ν2) for M3-fX0.1, M3-fX1 and M3-fX10.
We clearly see that pattern on the ( ν1,ν2) plane is qualita-
tively similar for all the three scenarios as long as the Ly- α
coupling plays important role. We also note that the 21-cm
MAPS becomes strictly positive over a large region near the
diagonal (ν1≈ν2) once the X-ray heating or the ionizing
photons starts becoming important for the signal. The fre-
quency at which this happens decreases with the increase in

fXvalue. Also, the IGM gets heated to a saturation level
quickly for larger fXvalues and the 21-cm MAPS decreases
at a faster rate towards larger frequencies (lower redshifts) as
seen in Figs. 8 and 9.
We plot the diagonal MAPS D/lscript(ν,ν) in Fig. 9, where the
four panels again corresponds to the four bins centered at
/lscript= 343,859,1393 and 2239. Considering M3- fX0.1, we ﬁnd
that the heating of the IGM is ineﬃcient here and we still
ﬁnd cold H iclouds till the end of the EoR (see top panel
of Fig. 2). For this reason the heating peak is absent in this
scenario. The second peak (at larger frequency) here is due to
the reionization. The behaviour of 21-cm MAPS here is qual-
itatively similar to that in M1 except for its values which are
orders of magnitude larger. We ﬁnd the heating peak of 21-
cm MAPS exists for both M3- fX1 and M3-fX10. However the
peak for M3- fX1 occurs at a later redshift (larger frequency)
than that in M3- fX10. We also note that the reionization
peak in 21-cm MAPS is absent for M3- fX1 as the IGM was
not heated suﬃciently for the signal to get governed majorly
by the ionization ﬁeld. This is not the case for M3- fX10, for
which the heating of IGM gets saturated before the reioniza-
tion starts and we do see a reionization peak in this scenario.
The dpendence of the CD-EoR 21-cm MAPS on heating ef-
ﬁciencies is qualitatively similar to what have been observed
in the 3D power spectra computed from the coeval boxes of
CD-EoR 21-cm signal in previous studies (e.g. Mesinger et al.
2013; Ghara et al. 2015a; Shimabukuro et al. 2015).
4 DETECTABILITY
At ﬁrst, we derive the formula for the error covariance of the
MAPS statistics here. Later, we use the formula to predict
the detectability of the diagonal component of the CD-EoR

4.1 MAPS error covariance
Any radio-interferometer directly measures the CD-EoR 21-
cm signal visibilities δ˜Tb2(U,ν) at frequency, say, νand base-
lines U=d/λ, where dis the antenna-pair separation pro-
jected onto the sky-plane, perpendicular to a chosen central
LoS, andλis the wavelength corresponding to ν. The baseline
tracks in diﬀerent frequency channels are the points where the
incoming signal is being sampled. The system noise, which
originates from statistical ﬂuctuations in the sky and the
receivers, is inherent to any radio-interferometric measure-
ment. Additionally, the foreground and other systematic er-
rors corrupt the actual cosmological signal. These contami-
nation aﬀects the MAPS estimate as well as the correspond-
ing error in the measurement. However, in this analysis, we
assume that the foreground is perfectly modelled and com-
pletely removed from the data and also that systematic er-
rors have been removed. Therefore the measured visibilities
will be the sum of cosmological 21-cm signal and the system
noise, i.e.˜Tt2(U,ν) =δ˜Tb2(U,ν) +˜TN2(U,ν). The system
noise is a Gaussian random ﬁeld on sky-surface and hence
˜TN2(U,ν) can be assumed to be uncorrelated at diﬀerent
baselines and frequencies. Therefore according to eq. (3), theMAPS of the total observed signal will then be the sum of sig-
nal MAPSC/lscript(ν1,ν2) and the system noise MAPS CN
/lscript(ν1,ν2),
i.e.,Ct
/lscript(ν1,ν2) =C/lscript(ν1,ν2)+δK
ν1,ν2CN
/lscript(ν1,ν2). The Kroneker’s
deltaδK
ν1,ν2appears here due to the fact that the Gaussian
system noise at diﬀerent frequencies remains uncorrelated.
Although it is possible to remove the noise bias from the to-
tal MAPS estimate (Bharadwaj et al. 2018), its contribution
to the total measurement error still remains.
Ignoring the non-Gaussianity of the underlying 21-cm ﬁeld,
we have calculated the error covariance matrix of the bin-
averaged MAPS estimator (eq. 4) which, in general, can be
written as (see Appendix A of Mondal et al. 2020a, for the
derivation)

diﬀerent pairs of frequencies, i.e. ( ν1,ν2) and (ν3,ν4). In re-
ality, the CD-EoR 21-cm signal is a non-Gaussian ﬁeld (e.g.
Bharadwaj & Pandey 2005; Harker et al. 2009) due to non-
Gaussianity arising due to various factors such as xHi, δB, Ts
in the signal (eq. 1). This non-Gaussianity gives rise to the
non-zero contributions from angular trispectrum to the cos-
mic variance (CV) of MAPS and also introduces correlations
between diﬀerent baselines (e.g. Mondal et al. 2015, 2016).
Mondal et al. (2016) and Mondal et al. (2017a) have devel-
oped a novel technique to estimate the 3D trispectrum from a
moderately large ensemble of 21-cm simulations. One can ex-
tend their technique to estimate the angular trispectrum for
the CD-EoR 21-cm signal, although it will be more computa-
tionally challenging. Hence, we drop the non-Gaussian contri-
bution in our calculations and analysis. Recently, Shaw et al.
(2019) have studied the importance of trispectrum contribu-
tion to the total error prediction in 3D power spectrum in
the context of future SKA-Low observations. Following their
results, we argue that non-Gaussian eﬀects will be important
for the small and intermediate /lscriptbins where the system noise
contribution is relatively smaller.
Here we simplify the full error covariance matrix and re-
strict ourselves to predicting the error variance of our MAPS
estimator which can be written as

Hence, we need the weights wg, the 21-cm MAPS
C/lscriptg(ν1,ν2) and the system noise MAPS CN
/lscriptg(ν1,ν2) at every
/lscriptgcell to predict the error variance in 21-cm MAPS. We have
estimated the 21-cm bin-averaged MAPS using simulated sig-
nal LC boxes. Note that the bin-averaged MAPS presented
above in sec. 3 considers uniform weights across the cells while
estimating ¯C/lscripti(ν1,ν2) from simulated signal.
Next, we compute the system noise MAPS at cells Ug=
/lscriptg/(2π) using (e.g. White et al. 1999; Zaldarriaga et al. 2004;

need to adjust the 8 h in the numerator in case the baseline

ement and ˜A(U) is the Fourier transform of the antenna

element to be circular with a diameter D. Considering circu-
lar symmetry, we approximate the main lobe of the primary
beam by a Gaussian A(θ) = exp(−θ2/θ2
0) (Choudhuri et al.
2014; Mondal et al. 2020a). The computation of system noise
MAPS (eq. 7) at every Ugcell depends on various design
speciﬁcations of the telescopes which are tabulated in Table
2.
We now consider a non-uniform weighting scheme as the
system noise contribution varies across the cells Ugfor the
noisy observational data. We obtain the weights at every
cells by maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio which is de-
ﬁned as SNR/lscripti

sumption that the 21-cm MAPS does not vary signiﬁcantly
across the cells within a particular bin, i.e.C/lscriptgi(ν1,ν2) =
¯C/lscripti(ν1,ν2). Under this assumption, we ﬁnd that the unnor-
malized weights can be written as (see e.g., Feldman et al.

We present the results for three current and upcoming radio-
interferometers HERA, NenuFAR and SKA-Low below.
4.2 Detectability with HERA
The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA6) is a
radio-interferometric telescope located in the Karoo desert,
South Africa. It consists of zenith pointing dishes of 14 m di-
ameter which are arranged in a closed packed hexagonal core
of about 300 m across. Currently this telescope is observing in
its ﬁrst phase with 50 dishes and within frequency bandwidth
100−200 MHz that spans EoR. In this analysis, we consider
the whole frequency bandwidth is divided into 1024 channels
having channel width 97 .66 kHz. Recently, Abdurashidova
et al. (2022); The HERA Collaboration et al. (2022) have put
best upper limits to date on EoR 21-cm 3D power spectrum
by analysing roughly 1000 h of HERA Phase I data. In its ﬁ-
nal phase, the array will consists of total 350 dishes all observ-
ing within a larger frequency range 50 −250 MHz which covers
both the CD and EoR (see e.g. Fagnoni et al. 2021). We con-
sider the upcoming ﬁnal phase of HERA for our predictions
here. We simulate baseline tracks of HERA observing in drift
scan mode at a declination DEC= −30◦43/prime17/prime/prime(phase center
of the telescope). We ﬁnally compute the total error variance
[σ/lscripti
12]2using eq. (9) where we set Trec= 170 K (see Table
2) which is similar to that of the Phase I receivers (see e.g.
Thyagarajan et al. 2020; Fagnoni et al. 2021). Note that the
common square /lscriptplane which is used for HERA predictions
extends between±11250 with cell size being ∆ /lscript= 97.82. We
divide this accessible /lscriptplane into 10 log-spaced circular bins
for estimating the errors.
Unlike ﬁeld tracking, the sky patch which HERA is look-
ing at constantly changes with time in drift-scan mode. Thus,we can say that at every integration time-stamp HERA mea-
sures a diﬀerent realization of the signal. This gives rise to
additional CV in the 21-cm MAPS measured at every voxel.
Based on this intuition, we add the contribution of this excess
variance in quadrature to eq. (10) for simplicity. Assuming
the ﬂuctuations in the MAPS due to drifting sky patch to
be Gaussian, we expect the additional variance in the diag-
onal MAPS to be proportional to the average measurement,
i.e.D2
/lscript(ν,ν)/Nsnap. The number of snapshots of the diﬀerent
sky patch drifting per night of observations Nsnapis set by
the integration time of the interferometer. Here we consider
HERA observing 8 hours per night with 60 sec integration
time resulting into Nsnap= 480. One can decrease the inte-
gration time for a ﬁxed observing hours per night to reduce
this excess CV. However, one can always compute the total
error variance starting from the scratch but it is not straight-
forward. We defer this to our future analysis with HERA. We
would like to emphasize that this change is incorporated only
for HERA, and not for the NenuFAR or SKA-Low.
Fig. 10 show the predictions for observing the diagonal of
21-cm MAPSD(ν,ν) for four diﬀerent /lscriptbins in four panels.
Every panel here is divided into two subpanels where, in the
top subpanel we show the D(ν,ν) (thick blue lines) along with
2σerror estimates ( i.e.2σ/lscripti
11) for diﬀerent observation time
tobs, and in the bottom subpanel we plot SNR for the cor-
responding tobsvalues. Here we have assumed that the fore-
ground is perfectly modelled and completely removed from
the observed data. However, this is not the case for HERA
which avoides ‘Foreground wedge’ in the ( k⊥,k/bardbl) plane (e.g.
Datta et al. 2010; Pober et al. 2013) to mitigate foregorunds
in power spectrum estimation. Therefore, the results pre-
sented below is optimistic and provide upper limits to the
sensitivity. One can follow the method described in section
6 of Mondal et al. (2020a) to incorporate the eﬀect of fore-
ground avoidance in an approximate way. However, we re-
strict ourselves to forground removal in order to make a fair
comparison with NenuFAR. Note that we ﬁx 2 σas the de-
tection criterion in this paper. Considering any panel, the
solid red and the solid orange lines represent the 2 σtotal
error (top subpanel) and the corresponding SNR (bottom
subpanel) respectively for tobs= 104 h and 1000 h. We also
plot the system noise contribution to the total error by red
and orange dotted lines respectively for both tobs= 104 h
and 1000 h in the top subpanels. We also plot the 2 σCV
(green dashed line) which is inherent to the signal and can
be achieved after hypothetically integrating the system noise
fortobs→∞ . The dot-dashed grey line in each of the bot-

how SNR of the measurements varies with the observing frequency νfor 104 h (red) and 1000 h (orange). The gray dashed lines in the
smaller panels demarcates SNR= 2 ﬂoor for detection.
tom subpanels demarcates the ﬂoor SNR= 2 above which we
claim it to be a detection.
Considering /lscript= 343 (top left panel), we ﬁnd that the 21-
cm MAPS will be detectable ( i.e.SNR>2) fortobs= 104 h
within frequency range 80 −132 MHz which contains the
heating peak for our ﬁducial model. The SNR here can go as
high as 4 at ν∼110 MHz which is closer to the CV limit.
Increasingtobsis expected to improves the SNR ∝tobsfor fre-
quencies where the total error is dominated by system noise
(ν >130 MHz). For tobs= 1000 h, we ﬁnd that 21-cm MAPSat/lscript= 343 can be measured roughly across the full CD-EoR
(ν > 75 MHz). We also note that the system noise contri-
butionσNincreases rapidly towards the smaller frequency as
the sky becomes brighter at large redshifts (see eq. 7). Con-
sidering the next bin at /lscript= 538 (top right panel), we ﬁnd
that the signal MAPS as well as its CV do not change much.
However we ﬁnd that σNrelatively increases thereby increas-
ing the total error in the measurement. This restricts the
detection of the 21-cm MAPS to a narrower frequency range,
i.e.betweenν= 96−130 MHz for 104 h and ν&82 MHz

for 1000 h. We ﬁnd that σNcontribution to total error in-
creases rapidly towards the larger /lscriptvalues (small scales).
This is due to the decrease of baseline distribution τ8(Ugi)
towards larger U=/lscript/(2π), and this decreases in baseline den-
sity is very rapid for compact arrays such as HERA. From
the bottom panels of Fig. 10, we note that 104 h of observa-
tions will be able to measure the 21-cm MAPS only within
ν≈100−120 MHz for /lscript= 853 where the CD MAPS peaks.
Fortobs= 1000 h the 2 σdetection is restricted only to lim-
ited frequency ranges between 87 −132 MHz for /lscript= 853 and
100−125 MHz for /lscript= 1347. The SNR drops considerably for
any bins larger than /lscript= 1347 due to sudden fall in baseline
sampling on the cells Ug.
4.3 Detectability with NenuFAR
NenuFAR3is an extension of the current LOFAR1telescope
that has been installed very recently at the Nan¸ cay Radio
Observatory in France. It is expected to consist of 96 core
stations (a.k.a. mini-arrays) which are distributed within a
compact circle of ∼400 m in diameter (Mertens et al. 2021).
Apart from the compact core, it will have 6 more mini-arrays
as remote-stations. Currently, NenuFAR has 80 core and 2
remote stations rolled out and rest will be installed in fu-
ture. Each mini-array consists of 19 crossed dipole antennas
arranged within a regular hexagonal pattern. NenuFAR op-
erates within a frequency bandwidth of 10 −85 MHz that
corresponds to a redshift range z≈16−140 spanning CD
and Dark Ages. NenuFAR has already started its ﬁrst phase
of observations. We consider the channel width for NenuFAR
to be twice of HERA, i.e.195.2 kHz. In this work, we consider
a mock observation tracking a ﬁeld at DEC= +47◦22/prime34/prime/prime
with the ﬁnal phase of NenuFAR having 102 mini-arrays. As
NenuFAR operates in a very low frequency band, its Trecis
expected to be larger compared to the other telescopes con-
sidered here. For the purpose of this work we have assumed a
mean value of Trec= 1000 K12(see Table 2) which remains
smaller than Tskyat the relevant frequencies.
Note that our LC boxes span a frequency range between
≈70−200 MHz where the X-ray heating, which is important
during CD, becomes eﬀective at ν >80 MHz for our ﬁducial
model M3-fX10 (see Figs. 1 and 2). This does not overlap at
the low-frequency end with the observational frequency band-
width of NenuFAR. Hence, we artiﬁcially shift our LC box
by 40 MHz towards smaller frequencies. The shifting in fre-
quency, in principle, demands a change in δBand therefore
δTb(x,ν) due to evolution in background cosmology. How-
ever, for this analysis, we have assumed that the eﬀect of the
change in cosmology can possibly be overridden by properly
tuning the physical processes by tweaking the relevant CD pa-
rameters within its uncertainties. We ﬁnally use the shifted
LC box to make predictions for NenuFAR. The prediction
here is to demonstrate the detectability of the NenuFAR in
case the CD falls within its frequency bandwidth, and can not
be directly compared with that of HERA. An better treat-
ment of the signal is required for more accurate predictions
and that we defer to our future work which will be devoted
to NenuFAR.
As we have shifted the box in frequency, the extent of the
12nenupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instru/instrument properties.htmlaccessible/lscriptplane for NenuFAR will be a little diﬀerent from
HERA. Here the square /lscriptplane has extent between ±12093
with ∆/lscript= 108.95, and we divide this also in 10 log-spaced
circular bins. Fig. 11 shows the predictions for measuring
21-cm MAPS using NenuFAR. Note that the following pre-
diction considers an optimistic scenario where the foreground
is assumed to be completely removed from the observed data.
The plot is arranged in a similar way as in Fig. 10, except here
we plot the 2 σerrors and SNR for 1000 h ,5000 h and 10000 h
in orange, red and cyan lines respectively. Our choices of tobs
here is not completely unrealistic as the data for more than
1000 h of observations have already been acquired with Nen-
uFAR. Considering the smallest bin at /lscript= 233 (top left panel
of Fig. 11), we ﬁnd that 1000 h of NenuFAR observations can
measure the X-ray heating peak of 21-cm MAPS only within
20 MHz band around ν= 70 MHz with SNR &2. Increasing
tobsto 5000 or 10000 h pushes the system noise contribution
σNwell below the CV error σCVatν&50 MHz and the total
errorσtotapproaches the CV limit. We ﬁnd that a detection
between 55−85 MHz is possible with 2 <SNR<3. The
SNR achieved for this bin is low due to small number of Ug
cells resulting into a larger CV contribution.
Moving to next bin, i.e./lscript= 366 (top right panel), the
relative contribution of CV to the total error decreases as
expected. The system noise and the 21-cm MAPS is seen
to increase in a similar proportion thereby improving the
SNR as compared to /lscript= 233. We ﬁnd that, for this bin
andtobs= 1000 h, the 21-cm MAPS will be detected within
a frequency range 58 −84 MHz with 2 6SNR63. This
frequency range further expands to νbetween 55−85 MHz
and 50−85 MHz for tobs>5000 h and 10000 h respectively,
with SNR becoming as large as 4. The detection is still not
possible for ν.55 MHz as the system noise increases rapidly
with decreasing νfor larger/lscriptvalues due to a decrease in the
baseline density distribution.
The system noise contribution increases further for /lscript= 587
(bottom left panel), where we note that tobs= 1000 h is able
to measure the peak of the MAPS within 64 −84 MHz at
26SNR63. Fortobs= 5000, the frequency range of the
detected MAPS increases to 58 −85 MHz with a maximum
SNR≈5. This further improves for tobs= 10000 h, how-
ever, not signiﬁcantly. As is apparent from Fig. 11, the CV
contribution σCVdecreases towards larger /lscriptvalues (bottom
panels) as there are more cells. However, the contribution
fromσNincreases at a faster rate with increasing /lscript. This
is due to the fact that the baseline density distribution de-
creases rapidly at large uvdistances because NenuFAR has
fewer correlated receiver elements (mini-arrays) than HERA.
Considering /lscript= 949 (bottom right panel), which is almost
dominated by system noise, we note that tobs&10000 h
of observations is required to measure the signal MAPS at
SNR>2 and that still within a narrow frequency band around
ν= 70 MHz. The system noise increases very rapidly for the
bins with/lscript&1000 for NenuFAR making it impractical to
measure the signal MAPS at small-angular scales.

Africa and will operate within the frequency range of 350 −

son Radioastronomy Observatory in Western Australia and
will operate within the frequency range of 50 −350 MHz.
SKA-Low will be suitable for the CD-EoR measurements
(Koopmans et al. 2014) as it can observe 21-cm signal coming
from the redshifts between z= 3 and 27. Here we consider
the channel width of SKA-Low to be the same as HERA, i.e.
97.66 kHz. SKA-Low will have ∼131 thousands log-periodicdipoles which will be distributed among 512 stations in its ﬁ-
nal phase. Each of the stations will have 256 dipoles that will
be scattered within a diameter of 35 m. The antenna layout
of SKA-Low will have a compact core with roughly 50 % of
stations lying within a diameter of ∼1 km. The remaining
stations will be grouped into clusters of 6 stations and these
clusters will be arranged in three modiﬁed spiral arms such
that the maximum baseline length will be ∼64 km (Dewdney
& Braun 2016). Here we consider an observation with SKA-
Low tracking a ﬁeld at DEC= −26◦49/prime29/prime/primefor 8 h/night. We

use the resulting baseline tracks to predict the errors in mea-
suring MAPS with this telescope. For SKA-Low, we have
used similar /lscriptplane and binned it on the same way as for
HERA.
Fig. 12 shows the errors estimated in the measurements of
D/lscript(ν,ν) fortobs= 104 h and 1000 h, just as we have presented
for HERA but for /lscript= 343,859,1393 and 2239. We note
that, the predictions here also consider foreground removal
for comparison on similar grounds. The color scheme of this
ﬁgure is exactly the same as that in Fig. 10. Comparing SKA-
Low with the previous telescopes, it is able to perform far bet-
ter in terms of sensitivity (Figs. 10, 11 and 12). Also having a
denser baseline distribution and longer uvextent allows SKA-
Low to measure MAPS on smaller scales ( /lscript≈5000) compared
to compact arrays such as HERA and NenuFAR. Considering
the four panels of Fig. 12, we note that SKA-Low will be ableto measure the CD 21-cm MAPS with 104 h of observations.
We ﬁnd that a 2 σmeasurement is possible within the fre-
quency ranges 80 −132 MHz,82−132 MHz,90−128 MHz
and 96−120 MHz respectively for /lscript= 343,859,1393 and
2239. We ﬁnd that the system noise contribution to the total
errorσtotdrops considerably for tobs= 1000 h allowing SNR
to rise above the detection limit of 2 in almost the whole fre-
quency bandwidth for the four /lscriptbins considered here. How-
ever the SNR does not improve much around the X-ray heat-
ing peak in 21-cm MAPS ( ν≈100 MHz) by increasing tobs
beyond 104 h for /lscript.1000 as the σtotis dominated by σCV. In
such cases, it is better to divide the total observation hours
over multiple independent sky-patches. This can be done for
the ﬁeld-tracking instruments such as NenuFAR and SKA-
Low. Combining the data incoherently from diﬀerent ﬁelds

will help in beating down the CV to the measured MAPS
(e.g. Koopmans et al. 2014).
Considering top panels for tobs= 1000 h, we ﬁnd that the
measurement of 21-cm MAPS is possible for ν>75 MHz
with maximum SNR ≈4 and 10, respectively for /lscript= 343
and 859. However, we note that the detection is possible at
ν>80 MHz for /lscript= 1393 and between 85 −170 MHz for
/lscript= 2239. The maximum value of SNR saturates to values
near 15 where σtotis dominated by CV for /lscript= 1393. For
/lscript= 2239 the SNR rises further to a maximum value of 20
near the heating peak ( ν≈105 MHz) of the 21-cm MAPS.
The system noise contributions σNtoσtotgradually increases
in the larger /lscriptbins as the baseline density decreases. This fur-
ther starts decreasing the SNR, and it requires larger values
oftobsto achieve a suﬃcient SNR to detect the signal from
small angular-scales (large /lscript).
5 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS
The measurements of brightness temperature ﬂuctuations
δTbof the redshifted 21-cm radiation from the H iprovides
a unique way to unveil the secrets of formation of the ﬁrst
luminous objects in the Universe. The primary goal of all
existing and future radio-interferometric experiments (e.g.
LOFAR, MWA, HERA, NenuFAR, uGMRT, SKA-Low) is
to measure the 3D power spectrum ∆2
b(k,z) of the ﬂuctuat-
ing 21-cm signal coming from the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and
Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The deﬁnition of 3D power
spectrum inherently assumes the signal to be statistically
homogeneous and isotropic along all directions of the signal
volume. However the CD-EoR 21-cm signal in real observa-
tions is not statistically homogeneous and isotropic along the
line of sight (LoS) direction of the observed volume due to
light-cone (LC) eﬀect (Barkana & Loeb 2006). The LC ef-
fect on the ∆2
b(k,z) is considerable for EoR 21-cm signal at
least on large-scales (e.g. Datta et al. 2012; Zawada et al.
2014; Mondal et al. 2017b). This eﬀect on 3D power spec-
trum becomes considerable during CD when the 21-cm signal
is controlled by the spin-temperature ﬂuctuations driven by
the X-ray sources (Ghara et al. 2015b). Also, we ﬁnd that
the deviations in 3D power spectrum due to LC eﬀects dur-
ing CD can be as large as ±100% for our ﬁducial model
(M3-fX10) at scales corresponding to k= 0.15 Mpc−1(see
Fig. 3). The deviations are found to decrease on small scales
(k= 1.1 Mpc−1), however they are still closer to ±100%for our ﬁducial model. Note that, here we consider a large
comoving volume V= [500h−1Mpc]3which corresponds to
a frequency bandwidth ∼40 MHz at relevant frequencies
which are not very unrealistic for the HERA and SKA-Low.
However the LC eﬀects will be less pronounced if the data is
analyzed within a smaller frequency band, say ∼10 MHz, as
is being done for LOFAR and NenuFAR etc.
The Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum (MAPS)
(eq. 3) provides an unbiased alternative to the 3D power
spectrum. In this work, we use the bin-averaged MAPS (Mon-
dal et al. 2017b) estimator (eq. 4) to quantify the two-point
statistics of the simulated (see section 2.1) LC of the CD-EoR
21-cm signal. We ﬁnd that the diagonal 21-cm MAPS D/lscript(ν,ν)
captures the signatures of cosmic evolution of the signal more
distinctly than the 3DPS (see Figs. 3, 7 and 9) when analyzed
within a large-bandwidth signal volume. However, this is a
matter of binning and analyzing the data. It is still possible
to see the distinct evolutionary features in 3DPS by comput-
ing it from the data divided into small-bandwidth chunks,
within which the signal is considerably correlated (see Fig.
5). Analyzing data in small bandwidths reduces the LC bias
in the 3DPS estimates, if not removed. The shape and the
amplitude of the 21-cm MAPS are sensitive to the properties
of the sources and the processes driving CD-EoR. This ex-
tra information has been tentetaively shown to provide more
stringent constraints over the EoR model parameters than
the 3DPS (Mondal et al. 2022). In a future work, we plan
to explore the impact of MAPS on the CD model parameter
estimation, relative to the 3DPS.
Considering a model where the spin temperature is satu-
rated andTs>> Tγ(here M1), we only see a dip around a
point where the reionization starts and a peak when IGM is
∼50% ionized. This feature in the MAPS of model M1 is dis-
tinctly diﬀerent from the other models (see Table 2.1) where
X-ray heating is included in the simulations self-consistently
from the beginning. We also note that the 21-cm MAPS of
M1 is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than that of
the other models with self-consistent evolution of Ts. In the
other two models M2 and M3, the unsaturated X-ray heat-
ing boosts 21-cm MAPS during CD by introducing additional
ﬂuctuations in δTbthroughTs. We distinctively note a peak
like feature around ν= 110 MHz in the diagonal and near-
diagonal elements (see Figs. 4 and 7) for models M2- fX10
and M3-fX10. The location of the heating peak and its width
depends upon the X-ray eﬃciency fXof the sources in the
IGM as seen in Figs. 8 and 9. We also note another peak
in 21-cm MAPS around ν= 90 MHz which arises due to
ﬂuctuations in the Ly- αcoupling in the model M3- fX10 (see
Figs. 8 and 9). The peak is prominent for large angular-scales
(small/lscript) and it gradually merges with the heating peak and
disappears as we move to the large /lscriptvalues.
We also ﬁnd the correlations between the signal at diﬀerent
frequencies ( ν1,ν2) signiﬁcantly drops roughly beyond ∆ ν=
±3 MHz (Fig. 5). The rate of decorrelation depends upon the
concerned epoch and also it can be related to the mean free
path of the photons which plays important role in governing
the signal during that epoch. We note that the epoch where
X-ray heating plays important role ( ν≈100−140 MHz), the
signal remains positively correlated over a larger frequency
range (see Figs. 4, 6 and 8) as the X-rays can travel farther.
On the other hand, the decorrelation during EoR is faster as
MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2023)Cosmic Dawn 21-cm MAPS 19
the mean free path of the UV photons is much less than that
of the X-rays.
The observed 21-cm signal from CD-EoR gets contami-
nated with the system noise, foregrounds, RFI and other sys-
tematics. This contributes to the error in the measurement of
21-cm MAPS along with the inherent cosmic variance (CV).
In this work, we present the detectability of the 21-cm MAPS
D(ν,ν) in the context of future observation using HERA,
NenuFAR and SKA-Low. We estimate the expected errors
in the measured 21-cm MAPS considering the observed sig-
nal to be free from systematics, foregrounds and RFI. We
note that NenuFAR follows the foreground removal strategy,
whereas HERA is designed to avoid the foreground wedge in
their power spectrum analysis. However for an equal compar-
ison, we assume that foreground is perfectly subtracted from
the data, for every telescope considered here, which leads to
optimistic sensitivity predictions. Here we assume that the
21-cm signal is statistically equivalent to a Gaussian random
ﬁeld and ignore the impact of trispectrum in the CV mea-
surements (e.g. Mondal et al. 2016). The contribution from
non-Gaussianity to the error estimates can be important only
during later stages of EoR where the trispectrum becomes
comparable or stronger than the Gaussian system noise con-
tribution (Shaw et al. 2019). During CD, the Gaussian system
noise will be much larger than the inherent non-Gaussianity
of the signal.
We ﬁnd that 104 h of HERA drift scan observations will be
able to provide the CD 21-cm MAPS (diagonal elements) at
>2σlevel for/lscript.1000 with the errors being dominated by
CV below/lscript≈400 (see Fig. 10). With 1000 h of observations,
we can achieve >2σmeasurement of CD 21-cm MAPS for
/lscript.1800. HERA is able to measure the EoR 21-cm MAPS
only for/lscript<850 with 1000 h observations. We can obtain the
maximum SNR of ≈8 with 1000 h of data for the bin corre-
sponding to /lscript= 853 (see Fig. 10). Increasing the observation
hours further can increase the SNR up to 10 which is ﬁxed
by the CV for this bin. The sensitivity of HERA decreases
for larger/lscriptbins due to compact baseline distribution and we
can not measure signal beyond /lscript= 1800.
The upcoming SKA-Low is expected to outperform HERA
in terms of sensitivity due to denser baseline densities. The
system noise contribution is much less for SKA-Low that
the total error in the measurement of CD 21-cm MAPS is
dominated mostly by the CV contribution for /lscript.1000 with
tobs= 104 h. Increasing tobsfurther to 1000 h does not im-
prove the SNR much for the CD signal. However the de-
tectability improves considerably for the EoR 21-cm MAPS
and it reaches SNR >2 fortobs= 1000 h. The system noise
increases and becomes comparable with the CV contribution
for/lscript>1000, however it is still possible to measure the peak
of the CD 21-cm MAPS with tobs= 104 h for /lscript<5000. The
EoR 21-cm MAPS can only be detected at SNR >2 within
/lscript<2240, but for tobs= 1000 h. The SNR for SKA-Low can
be as high as 10 and 20 respectively for tobs= 104 h and
1000 h even at intermediate scales of /lscript∼1000 (see Fig. 12).
NenuFAR operates in a frequency band 10 −85 MHz which
probes the 21-cm signal farther in redshift than HERA and
SKA-Low. It has channels which are twice as wide as for
HERA and SKA-Low. Given this mismatch in the frequency
band with the other telescopes, we consider a diﬀerent CD-
EoR model for NenuFAR predictions. This new model as-
sumes that heating started at earlier redshifts such that thestrong impact of spin temperature ﬂuctuations falls within
the frequency band of NenuFAR. If the peak of CD 21-cm
MAPS falls in the range of NenuFAR, it will be possible to
measure it at SNR >2 for/lscript.600 withtobs= 1000 h
(see Fig. 11). The SNR will improve if tobsis increased to
say 5000 h or 10000 h but the noticeable change is only re-
stricted to a narrow range of 360 < /lscript < 600. The reason
for such large error in the measurement is the system noise
contribution which increases very rapidly towards large red-
shifts. It is not possible to achieve an SNR >2 per frequency
channel even with tobs= 10000 h beyond /lscript= 1000.
The whole point of computing MAPS by correlating the
21-cm signal across the frequency channel elements is for
keeping the LC evolution information from the signal vol-
ume. However, analyzing the data over small frequency chan-
nels makes the 21-cm MAPS statistics suﬀer from the noise
contribution. Whereas in 3DPS, we analyze the data over a
large frequency bandwidth that eﬀectively reduces the noise
contribution in 3DPS estimates. Contradicting the philoso-
phy behind MAPS, one can anyway improve the SNR of the
MAPS measurements by combining the observed signal in
consecutive frequency channels. This way of beating down
noise is eﬀective only when the measurement error is domi-
nated by the system noise such as in the case of NenuFAR.
We ﬁnd that averaging the signal within a frequency band of
5 MHz around the CD MAPS peak frequency considerably
improves the integrated SNR for NenuFAR (see the last col-
umn of Table 3). However there is small change for HERA
and negligible change for SKA-Low as compared to the SNR
per channel estimated at /lscript∼550 fortobs= 1000 h. This
is because the error is CV dominated for both HERA and
SKA-Low.
It is possible to further reduce the CV and improve SNR
for ﬁeld-tracking instruments (e.g. SKA-Low, NenuFAR) by
breaking up one long observation (say >1000 h) to shorter
observations targeting diﬀerent sky-patches and combining
them afterwards. However, the division should be such that
the system noise SNR computed from an individual patch re-
mains well above unity (e.g. Koopmans et al. 2014). Nonethe-
less the channel averaging can still be useful to achieve a
decent integrated SNR for HERA and SKA-Low at large /lscript
and/or for smaller tobswhere the system noise remains domi-
nant. However one needs to choose the frequency range care-
fully such that the 21-cm signal MAPS does not decrease too
much especially near the peaks.
Our study ﬁnally concludes that it will be possible to mea-
sure the CD-EoR 21-cm MAPS within reasonable observation
time using the current and upcoming radio-interferometers
mentioned in this paper. Incorporating the eﬀects of fore-
grounds, however, can degrade the prospect of detection
(Mondal et al. 2020a). We also ignore the eﬀects of non-
Gaussianity of the 21-cm signal which can aﬀect the error
predictions and hence the detectability, especially during the
mid and later stages of EoR. It is therefore important to in-
clude the impact of foreground as well as that of the inherent
non-Gaussianity of the signal to make realistic predictions,
and we defer these tasks for our future work.
