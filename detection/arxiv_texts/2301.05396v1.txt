arXiv:2301.05396v1  [math.CO]  13 Jan 2023AUTOMORPHISMS OF THE CANONICAL
DOUBLE COVER OF A TOROIDAL GRID
DAVE WITTE MORRIS
Abstract. TheCartesian productoftwo cycles ( Cn/squareCm)has anaturalembedding
on the torus, such that each face of the embedding is a 4-cycle . The toroidal grid
Qd(m,n,r) is a generalization of this in which there is a shift by rwhen traversing
the meridian of length m.
In 2008, Steve Wilson found two interesting inﬁnite familie s of (nonbipartite)
toroidal grids that are unstable. (By deﬁnition, this means that the canonical
bipartite double cover of the grid has more than twice as many automorphisms
as the grid has.) It is easy to see that bipartite grids are als o unstable, because
the canonical double cover is disconnected. Furthermore, t here are degenerate cases
in which there exist two diﬀerent vertices that have the same n eighbours. This
paper proves Wilson’s conjecture that Qd( m,n,r) is stable for all other values of
the parameters.
In addition, we prove an analogous conjecture of Wilson for t he triangular grids
Tr(m,n,r) that are obtained by adding a diagonal to each face of Qd( m,n,r) (with
all of the added diagonals parallel to each other).
1.Introduction
(1.1)Deﬁnition. Thecanonical bipartite double cover [15] of a graph Xis the bipartite graph BX
withV(BX) =V(X)×{0,1}, where
(v,0) is adjacent to ( w,1) inBX⇐⇒vis adjacent to winX.
LettingS2be the symmetric group on the 2-element set {0,1}, it is clear that Aut X×S2is a
subgroup of Aut BX. If this subgroup happens to be all of Aut BX, then we say that Xisstable
[10, p. 160].
Understanding unstable graphs is a fundamental problem in t he study of automorphisms of
direct products (see [11, Prop. 5.6]), and also arises in oth er contexts (see the introductions of [12]
and [16]).
In the appendix of [16], S.Wilson stated conjectures about e xactly which graphs in certain
families are unstable. Here is the current status of each of t hese conjectures:
(A.1) Wilson’s conjecture about circulant graphs is known t o be false: a counterexample was
published in [12, p. 156], and inﬁnite families of additiona l counterexamples can be found
in [6]. We still do not know which circulant graphs are unstab le, but progress was made in
[2, 6, 7, 12].
(A.2) Wilson’s conjecture on generalized Petersen graphs i s correct [13].

(A.3) There does not seem to have been any progress on Wilson’ s conjecture about rose window
graphs.
(A.4) Thispaperproves (slight generalizations of) Wilson ’s two conjectures abouttoroidal graphs.
We now state our main results.
(1.2)Deﬁnition ([16, pp. 380 and 381]) .Givenm,n∈Z(withm,n≥2), andr∈Zn, we can
•number the vertices of the cycle Cnwith the elements of Zn, and
•number the vertices of the path Pm+1with the elements of {0,1,...,m}.
(In the special case where m= 2, we let C2=K2.) Then
(1) Qd(m,n,r)isthegraphthatisobtainedfromtheCartesianproduct Cn/squarePm+1byidentifying
the vertex ( x,m) with (x+r,0), for each x∈Zn, and
(2) Tr(m,n,r) is the graph that is obtained from Qd( m,n,r) by adding an edge from ( x,y) to
(x+1,y−1) for each x∈Znandy∈ {1,2,...,m}.
(See Lemma 2.3 for reformulations of these deﬁnitions in the language of Cayley graphs.)
(1.3)Remark. Qd(m,n,r) has a natural embedding on the torus, such that each face of t he
embedding is a 4-cycle. (In the special case where r= 0, the graph Qd( m,n,0) is isomorphic to the
Cartesian product Cn/squareCm.) So Qd( m,n,r) is often called a toroidal grid . The graph Tr( m,n,r)
is obtained by adding a diagonal in each face of Qd( m,n,r). Therefore, the faces of its natural
toroidal embedding are triangles.
There are some trivial reasons for a graph to be unstable [16, p. 360]:
(1) Every disconnected graph is unstable.
(2) Every bipartite graph with a nontrivial automorphism is unstable.
(3) If two diﬀerent vertices of a graph have the same neighbour s, then the graph is unstable.
(These are called “twin vertices” [8].)
This motivates the following deﬁnition:
(1.4)Deﬁnition ([16, p. 360]) .An unstable graph is nontrivially unstable if it is connected and
nonbipartite, and has no twin vertices. (Otherwise, it is trivially unstable .)
The following two results were conjectured by S.Wilson [16, pp. 380 and 381], who proved the
direction ( ⇐) of each theorem (except parts (5) and (6) of 1.6). (We write “ ±” in Theorem 1.5
because Qd( m,n,r) is always isomorphic to Qd( m,n,−r), as explained in Corollary 2.4. Also recall
that the parameter rin Qd(m,n,r) and Tr( m,n,r) is taken modulo n.)
(1.5)Theorem (cf. Theorem 3.1) .Qd(m,n,r)is nontrivially unstable if and only if it is:
(1) Qd(m,4k,±k), wherem+kis odd, or
(2) Qd(2 m,km,±4ℓm) (∼=Qd(m,2km,±2ℓm)ifm >1), wheremis odd,4ℓ2≡ ±1 (modk),
and either m >1or2ℓ/ne}ationslash≡ ±1 (modk).
(1.6)Theorem (cf. Theorem 4.1) .Tr(m,n,r)is nontrivially unstable if and only if it is:
(1) Tr(2,4k,4)∼=Tr(2,4k,−2)∼=Tr(4,2k,2), or
(2) Tr(2,4k,2k+1), or
(3) Tr(2,4k,2k)∼=Tr(2,4k,2k+2)∼=Tr(2k,4,2), or
(4) Tr(4,2k,0)∼=Tr(4,2k,4)∼=Tr(2k,4,0), or
(5) Tr(2k,4,1), withk >1, orTr(2k,4,−1), or
(6) Tr(4,2,1), orTr(4,3,−1).
(Ifkis odd, then the graphs in (3)are isomorphic to the graphs in (4). Ifkis even, then the two
graphs in (5)are isomorphic to each other. )AUTOMORPHISMS OF THE CANONICAL DOUBLE COVER OF A TOROIDAL GR ID 3
(1.7)Example. By searching Theorem 1.5 for cases where r= 0, we see that, for n≥m≥2, the
Cartesian product Cn/squareCmis nontrivially unstable if and only if n= 2mandmis odd.
(1.8)Remark. Theorems 1.5 and 1.6 only list graphs that are nontrivially unstable. However, it
is easy to check whether a toroidal grid is trivially unstabl e. First, note that they are all connected.
Also:
(a) Qd(m,n,r) is bipartite if and only if nandm+rare even.
(b) Qd(m,n,r) has twin vertices if and only if m= 2 and r=±2 (cf. Remark 3.2)).
(c) Tr(m,n,r) is never bipartite (because it has triangles).
(d) Tr(m,n,r) has twin vertices if and only if ( m,n,r)∈ {(2,4,1),(3,3,0)}(cf. Lemma 4.2).
(1.9)Remarks.
(1) Theassumption that m,n≥2is not stated explicitly in [16]. Wilson’s conjectures als o seem
to implicitly assume that gcd( n,r)/ne}ationslash= 1. We do not make this assumption, so Theorems 1.5
and 1.6 include include inﬁnite families of graphs that are n ot listed in Wilson’s conjectures.
(2) There are other diﬀerences between Wilson’s conjectures [16, pp. 380 and 381] and our
statements of the results. In particular:
(a) Wilson omits Qd( m,4k,−k) and Qd(2 m,km,±4ℓ), and usually omits Tr( m,n,m−r)
whenTr( m,n,r)islisted. Corollary 2.4explainsthattheyarealternate r epresentations
of other graphs in the list.
(b) Wilson requires kto be odd in 1.5(2), but we omit this redundant condition: it i s a
consequence of the equation 4 ℓ2≡ ±1 (modk).
(c) Wilson uses 4 kin 1.6(4), instead of 2 k. That eliminates the overlap with 1.6(3).
(3) The two occurrences of “ ±” in 1.5(2) cause redundancy (and could therefore be omitted ),
because−ℓsatisﬁes the congruence 4 ℓ2≡ ±1 (modk) whenever ℓdoes.
(1.10)Remark. Following a section of preliminaries, Theorem 3.1 is proved in Section 3, and
Theorem 4.1 is provided in Section 4. Theorems 3.1 and 4.1 are slightly more general than
Theorems 1.5 and 1.6. For example, their statements in the la nguage of abelian Cayley graphs
allow for the case where mis equal to 1. See the well-known Lemma 2.3 for the translatio n between
the two languages.2.Preliminaries
All graphs in this paper are simple (no loops or multiple edge s).
2A.Abelian Cayley graphs
(2.1)Deﬁnition (cf. [3, p. 34]) .LetSbe a subset of an additive abelian group G, such that
S=−Sand 0/∈S. The corresponding abelian Cayley graph Cay(G;S) is the graph whose vertices
are the elements of G, and with an edge joining the vertices gandhif and only if g=h+sfor
somes∈S.
(2.2)Remark. The adjective “abelian” in “abelian Cayley graph” is to emph asize the assumption
thatGis abelian, so we will sometimes omit it when it is not relevan t. (The usual deﬁnition of
Cay(G;S) does not require Gto be abelian, but we have no need for the nonabelian case in th is
paper.)
The following simple (and well known) observation notes tha t the toroidal grids Qd( m,n,r) and
Tr(m,n,r) are isomorphic to abelian Cayley graphs. The minus sign in T r(m,n,−r) is because
the deﬁnition of Tr( m,n,−r) would naturally identify it with the Cayley graph having a−bas the
third generator, but, for our purposes, it is more convenien t to usea+b.
(2.3)Lemma. Givenm,n,r∈Z(withm,n≥2), let
G=/an}bracketle{ta,b|ma=rb, nb= 0, a+b=b+a/an}bracketri}ht,
soGis an abelian group of order mn. Then
Qd(m,n,r)∼=Cay(G;±a,±b)
and
Tr(m,n,−r)∼=Cay/parenleftbig
G;±a,±b,±(a+b)/parenrightbig
.
(2.4)Corollary. Qd(m,n,r)∼=Qd(m,n,−r)andTr(m,n,r)∼=Tr(m,n,m−r).
Proof.(Qd) We have ma=−r(−b) andn(−b) = 0, so using −bin the place of byields a
representation of Cay( G;±a,±b) as Qd(m,n,−r).
(Tr) Let c=−(a+b), so{±a,±b,±(a+b)}={±c,±b,±(c+b)}. Then
mc=−ma−mb=−rb−mb=−(r+m)b,
so using cin the place of ayields a representation of Cay( G;±a,±b,±(a+b)) as Tr( m,n,r+m).
Therefore Tr( m,n,−r)∼=Tr(m,n,r+m). /square
(2.5)Remark. By replacing awith−a, the proof of Corollary 2.4 shows that Qd( m,n,r)∼=
Qd(m,n,−r). However, the same trick does not work for Tr( m,n,r): ifais replaced with −a,
then the equation a+b+c= 0 forces bandcto also be replaced with their negatives. Since
m(−a) =−ma=−rb=r(−b), this does not result in any change in the parameter r.
Here is an abelian Cayley graph that appears in the statement of Theorem 3.1(4):

2B.Some classes of stable/unstable abelian Cayley graphs
(2.7)Theorem (Morris [11, Thm. 1.1]) .There are no nontrivially unstable abelian Cayley graphs
of odd order.
Recall that if Gis cyclic, then Cay( G;S) is acirculant graph. The following result is stated only
for circulant graphs in [7], but exactly the same proof appli es to abelian Cayley graphs.
(2.8)Proposition (Hujdurovi´ c-Mitrovi´ c-Morris, cf. [7, Prop. 4.2]) .There are no nontrivially
unstable abelian Cayley graphs of valency ≤3.
(2.9)Theorem (Hujdurovi´ c-Mitrovi´ c-Morris [7, Thm. 4.3]) .A circulant graph Cay(Zn,{±a,±b})
of valency 4is unstable if and only if either it is trivially unstable, or one of the following conditions
is satisﬁed (perhaps after interchanging aandb):
(1)nis divisible by 8andgcd/parenleftbig
|a|,|b|/parenrightbig
= 4, or
(2)n≡2 (mod 4) ,gcd(b,n) = 1, anda≡ℓb+ (n/2) (mod n), for some ℓ∈Z, such that
ℓ2≡ ±1 (modn).
(2.10)Theorem (Hujdurovi´ c-Mitrovi´ c-Morris [7, Thm. 5.1]) .A circulant graph Cay(Zn;S)of
valency5is unstable if and only if either it is trivially unstable, or it is either:
(1) Cay( Z12k;±s,±2k,6k)withsodd, or
(2) Cay( Z8;±1,±3,4)
(2.11)Theorem (Hujdurovi´ c-Mitrovi´ c-Morris [7, Cor. 6.8]) .A circulant graph
X= Cay(Zn,{±a,±b,±c})
of valency 6is unstable if and only if either it is trivially unstable, or it is one of the following:
(1) Cay( Z8k,{±a,±b,±2k}), whereaandbare odd,
(2) Cay( Z4k,{±a,±b,±b+2k}), whereais odd and bis even,
(3) Cay/parenleftbig

, wherea≡0 (mod 4) andkis odd,
(4) Cay( Z8k,{±a,±b,4k±b}), whereais even and |a|is divisible by 4,
(5) Cay( Z8k,{±a,±k,±3k}), wherea≡0 (mod 4) andkis odd,
(6) Cay( Z4k,{±a,±b,±mb+2k}), where
gcd(m,4k) = 1,(m−1)a≡2k(mod 4k), and
eitherm2≡1 (mod 4 k)or(m2+1)b≡0 (mod 4 k),
(7) Cay( Z8k,{±a,±b,±c}), where there exists m∈Z, such that
gcd(m,8k) = 1,m2≡1 (mod 8 k), and
(m−1)a≡(m+1)b≡(m+1)c≡4k(mod 8k).
2C.Criteria for stability or instability
(2.12)Lemma (cf. [2, Lem. 2.4]) .A connected, abelian Cayley graph X= Cay(G;S)is unstable if
and only if there exists α∈AutBX, such that α(0,0) = (0,0), butα(0,1)/ne}ationslash= (0,1).
(2.13)Remark. It is easy to see (and well known) that an abelian Cayley graph Cay(G;S) has
twin vertices if and only if S+z=S, for some nonzero z∈G. In other words, Sis a union of
cosets of /an}bracketle{tz/an}bracketri}ht. By passing to a subgroup of /an}bracketle{tz/an}bracketri}ht, there is no harm in assuming that |z|is prime.
The following result was stated only for circulant graphs in [6, Prop. 3.7] (which is a slight
generalization of [16, Thm. C.4]), but the same proof applie s more generally. (In fact, the proof
even applies without the assumption that zhas order 2, if S+z=−(S+z) is symmetric. And
there is no need for Gto be abelian.)6 DAVE WITTE MORRIS
(2.14)Lemma ([6, Prop. 3.7], cf. [16, Thm. C.4]) .An abelian Cayley graph Cay(G;S)is unstable
ifCay(G;S)∼=Cay(G;S+z), for some element zof order 2inG.
(2.15)Lemma (Wilson [16, §2.2]).A graph Xis unstable if it has an automorphism α, such that
the subgraph induced by the set of un-ﬁxed vertices is discon nected and has a component C, such
thatCis bipartite, and either α(C)/ne}ationslash=Cor each of the two bipartition sets of Cisα-invariant.
(2.16)Proposition (Hujdurovi´ c-Mitrovi´ c [5, Prop. 3.2]) .LetXbe a connected graph with more
than one vertex, and assume that Xsatisﬁes the following conditions:
(1)Every edge of Xlies on a triangle.
(2)For every x∈V(X), it holds that:
(a)every vertex at distance 2fromxhas a neighbour at distance 3fromx, and
(b)every vertex at distance 3fromxhas a neighbour at distance 4fromx.
ThenXis stable.
2D.Other results on automorphisms and isomorphisms
(2.17)Proposition (Baik-Feng-Sim-Xu [1, Thm. 1.1]) .LetSbe a generating set of an abelian
groupG, such that S=−S,0/∈S, and, for all s,t,u,v∈S:
s+t=u+v/ne}ationslash= 0 =⇒ {s,t}={u,v}.
Ifαis any automorphism of the graph Cay(G;S), such that α(0) = 0, thenαis an automorphism
of the group G(i.e.,α(g+h) =α(g)+α(h), for allg,h∈G).
(2.18)Deﬁnition ([4, p. 35]) .Recall that the Cartesian product X/squareYof two graphs XandY
has vertex set V(X)×V(Y), and two vertices ( x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are adjacent if and only if either
•x1=x2andy1y2∈E(Y), or
•y1=y2andx1x2∈E(X).
(2.19)Proposition (cf. [4, Thm. 6.10, p. 69]) .LetXbe a connected graph. If there does not exist
a graphY, such that X∼=Y/squareK2, then
Aut(X/squareK2) = AutX×S2andAut(X/squareC4) = AutX×AutC4.
We will use the following elementary observation in part (4) of the proof of Lemma 3.3.
(2.20)Lemma. LetXandYbe graphs. If Yis bipartite, then B(X/squareY)∼=(BX)/squareY.
2E.Stability of a few speciﬁc graphs
(2.21)Example ([12, Example 2.2]) .Ifn≥3, then the complete graph Knis stable. (But K2is
bipartite, and is therefore unstable.)
(2.22)Lemma. For2≤n≤7, the abelian Cayley graph
Cay/parenleftbig
Zn×Z2;±(1,0),±(1,1),(0,1)/parenrightbig
is stable, unless n= 4, in which case it is unstable.
Proof.This can be checked very quickly by computer. For example, th esagemath program in
Figure 1 can be executed on https://cocalc.com . (The program also veriﬁes Lemma 2.24.) /square
(2.23)Remark. Most cases of Lemma 2.22 can be settled quite easily without a computer:
•Ifnis odd, then Zn×Z2is cyclic, so Theorem 2.10 can be applied.
•Ifn= 2, then the Cayley graph is K4, which is stable by Example 2.21.AUTOMORPHISMS OF THE CANONICAL DOUBLE COVER OF A TOROIDAL GR ID 7
•Ifn= 4, then part (1) of the proof of Lemma 4.3 explains why the Cay ley graph is unstable.
Therefore, n= 6 is the only case that requires eﬀort (or a computer).
(2.24)Lemma. For3≤n≤12, the abelian Cayley graph
Cay/parenleftbig
Zn×Z3;±(1,0),±(1,1),±(0,1)/parenrightbig
is stable, unless n= 3, in which case it is unstable (and is listed in Theorem 4.1 (5)).
Proof.As mentioned in the proof of Lemma 2.22, the stability/insta bility of these graphs is
calculated by the sagemath program in Figure 1.
Forn= 3, the elements a= (1,0) andb= (0,1) have order 3. Also, if we let c=−(1,1), then
a+b+c= (0,0). Therefore, the Cayley graph is described in Theorem 4.1( 5). /square

(3.1)Theorem. A connected abelian Cayley graph Cay(G;S)of valency 4is unstable if and only

.
Before proving this theorem, let us show that it implies Theo rem 1.5.
Proof of Theorem 1.5. The graphs in Theorem 1.5 are required to be nontrivially uns table.
Therefore, we see from Proposition 2.8 that they must have va lency 4. Hence, it suﬃces to show
that the graphs in Theorem 1.5 are precisely the graphs that a rise from Theorem 3.1 by applying
Lemma 2.3 (and are not trivially unstable), and satisfy the a dditional assumption that m,n≥
2 (where n=|b|andm=|G:/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht|). To do this, we consider each part of the statement of
Theorem 3.1 individually. We also ﬁnd the toroidal grids tha t are obtained by applying Lemma 2.3
after interchanging aandb. (And we know from Corollary 2.4 that Qd( m,n,r)∼=Qd(m,n,−r).)
(1) The conditions in 1.5(1) that n= 4kandr=±kare a direct translation of the fact that
|/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht ∩ /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht|= 4. The additional condition that m+kis odd ensures that the grid is not
trivially unstable (see Remark 1.8).
Since the condition in 3.1(1) is symmetric in aandb, no additional examples are obtained
by interchanging aandb.
(2) The grid Qd( m,2km,2ℓm) of 1.5(2) is obtained from a direct translation of the condi tions
in 3.1(2). The condition that mis odd ensures that the grid is not trivially unstable (see
Remark 1.8). However, the deﬁnition of Qd( m,n,r) requires m >1.
Now, we let aplay the role of bin Lemma 2.3. Note that gcd( k,ℓ) = 1, because 4 ℓ2≡
1 (modk). Therefore, we have
|a|=|G:/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht|·|/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht∩/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht|=m·2km
gcd(2km,2ℓm)=m·2km
2m=km.
Hence,|G:/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht|=|G|/|a|=m(2km)/(km) = 2m. Also, since ma= 2ℓmband 4ℓ2≡
±1 (modk) (and|b|= 2km), we have
4ℓma= (4ℓ)(2ℓmb) = 4ℓ2(2mb) =±2mb.
So this yields the graph Qd(2 m,km,±4ℓm) of 1.5(2) (even if m= 1).
However, this graph has twin vertices (and is therefore triv ially stable) if (and only if)
2m= 2 and 4 ℓm≡ ±2 (modkm) (see Remark 1.8). This situation is ruled out by assuming
(at the end of 1.5(2)) that either m >1 or 2ℓ/ne}ationslash≡ ±1 (modk).
(3) This is trivially unstable (see Remark 3.2).
(4) The generating sets arising here are not of the form {±a,±b}, so Lemma 2.3 cannot be
applied. These Cayley graphs are therefore not needed to ﬁnd all of the toroidal grids. /square

(3.2)Remark. It is easy to determine whether a particular Cayley graph lis ted in Theorem 3.1 is
trivially unstable. First, note that the graph is assumed to be connected (i.e., it is assumed that S
generates G). Case 1 of the proof shows that the examples with twin vertic es are precisely those
in (3). So all that remains is to determine which of them are bi partite (which is usually answered
by Remark 1.8(a)).
3.1(1) This is bipartite if and only if |a|/4 +|b|/4 is even. It has twin vertices if and only if
|a|=|b|= 8 (in which case, it is also bipartite).
3.1(2) This is bipartite if and only if mis even. It has twin vertices if and only if m= 1 and
2ℓ≡ ±1 (modk).
3.1(3) As mentioned above, this graph has twin vertices, and is therefore trivially unstable. (For
completeness, we observe that it is bipartite if and only if |a|and|b|are even.)
3.1(4) This is bipartite if and only if nis odd. (It never has twin vertices.)
To avoid cluttering the main part of the proof of Theorem 3.1, we present one direction of the
argument in the following lemma. It is mostly (or entirely?) known: the instability of the graphs
in (1) and (2) was proved by S.Wilson [16, §A.4.1], and the rest is very easy. However, Wilson gave
only a one-sentence sketch of his proofs, so we will provide a fairly complete argument for every
case.
(3.3)Lemma (cf. S.Wilson [16, §A.4.1]).All of the graphs listed in Theorem 3.1 are unstable.
Proof.We consider each part of the statement of the theorem individ ually. We may assume each
Cayley graph is not bipartite (for otherwise it is trivially unstable).
(1) (S.Wilson [16, Thm. Q.1, p. 380]) Let m=|G:/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht|andn=|b|, and choose r∈Z, such that
ma=rb. Also, let zbe the element of order 2 in /an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht∩/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht. Since|b|is divisible by 4, we know that
|b+z|=|b|=n, so|G:/an}bracketle{tb+z/an}bracketri}ht|=|G:/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht|=m. Also note that, since |/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht ∩ /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht|= 4, we have
|rb|= 4, so−rb=rb+z=rb+ (m+r)z(sincem+ris odd, because the Cayley graph is not
bipartite). Therefore
m(−a+z) =−ma+mz=−rb+mz=rb+(m+r)z+mz=r(b+z).
Therefore, there is an automorphism ϕofG, such that ϕ(a) =−a+zandϕ(b) =b+z. Thenϕ
is an isomorphism from Cay( G;S) to Cay( G;S+z). This implies that Cay( G;S) is unstable (see
Lemma 2.14).
(2) (S.Wilson [16, Thm. Q.2, p. 381]) Let n= 2km=|b|andr= 2ℓm, soma=rb. Also, let z
be the element of order 2 in /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht. Note that:
•mis odd, because Xis bipartite and r= 2ℓmis even, and
•gcd(2ℓ,k) = 1, because 4 ℓ2≡1 (modk) (sokis odd).
Then, since |b|= 2kmandkmis odd, we see that |b+z|=km. Also (using the fact that
gcd(ℓ,k) = 1), we have
|a|=m·|b|
gcd(r,|b|)=m·2km
gcd(2ℓm,2km)=m·k.
Sincemkis odd, this implies |a+z|= 2mk=|b|.
Also note that, since 4 ℓ2=pk±1 for some p∈Z(andpmust be odd), we have
4ℓ2b= (pk±1)b=pkb±b=pz±b=z±b.
Therefore
r(a+z) = 2ℓm(a+z) = 2ℓrb+0 = 2ℓ(2ℓmb) = 4ℓ2mb=m(z±b) =±m(b+z),
Hence, there is an automorphism ϕofG, such that ϕ(b) =a+zand either ϕ(a) =b+zor
ϕ(a) =−b+z. In either case, ϕis an isomorphism from Cay( G;S) to Cay( G;S+z). This implies
that Cay( G;S) is unstable (see Lemma 2.14).10 DAVE WITTE MORRIS
(3) Cay(G;S) has twin vertices (see Remark 3.2), so it is trivially unsta ble.
(4) Since the Cayley graph is not bipartite, we know that nis even. By Lemma 2.20, we have
BX=B(M2n/squareK2)∼=(BM2n)/squareK2∼=(C2n/squareK2)/squareK2∼=C2n/squareC4.
So|AutBX| ≥ |AutC2n|·|AutC4|= 4n·8 = 32n.
Ifn≥4, then
|AutX|=|Aut(M2n/squareK2)|= 2|AutM2n|= 8n <1
2|AutBX|,
soXis unstable.
For the special case where n= 2, we have X∼=K4/squareK2, so .
|AutX|=|AutK4|·|AutK2|= 4!·2.
However,
BX∼=(BK4)/squareK2∼=(K2/squareK2/squareK2)/squareK2,
so|AutBX|= 4!·24≫2|AutX|. Therefore Xis unstable. /square
Proof of Theorem 3.1. (⇐) See Lemma 3.3.
(⇒) LetX= Cay(G;S), and assume that Xis connected and unstable, but not bipartite. We
will show that Xis in the list.
Case 1. AssumeXis trivially unstable. SinceXis assumed to be connected and nonbipartite,
it must have twin vertices. Therefore, Sis a union of cosets of some subgroup /an}bracketle{tz/an}bracketri}htof prime order
(see Remark 2.13). Since Xhas valency 4, we know that |S|= 4, so we must have |z|= 2 (since |z|
is a prime number that divides |S|).
Subcase 1.1. Assume S={±a,±b}, where|a|,|b|>2.We may assume a+z∈ {−a,b}
(perhaps after replacing bwith its negative).
•Ifa+z=−a, then 2a=z(and−a+z=a). Also,b+z/∈ {±a}, so we must have b+z=−b,
which implies 2 b=z. Therefore 2 a=z= 2b, so (3) is satisﬁed.
•Ifa+z=b, then 2b= 2(a+z) = 2a+2z= 2a+0 = 2a, so (3) is satisﬁed.
Subcase 1.2. Assume S={±a,b,c}, where|a|>2and|b|=|c|= 2.Sinceb+z∈Sand
2(b+z) = 2b+ 2z= 0 + 0 = 0, we must have b+z=c(and hence c+z=b). Soa+z=−a,
which implies z= 2a(and|a|= 4). Now, since Xis not bipartite, there exist p,q,r∈Z, such that
pa+qb+rc= 0 and p+q+ris odd. Then
0 =pa+qb+rc=pa+qb+r(b+2a)≡(q+r)b(moda).
Ifq+ris odd, this implies b∈ /an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht, sob=z(sincezis the unique element of order 2 in /an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht. But
thenc=b+z=z+z= 0, which contradicts the fact that |c|= 2.
Soq+ris even. Therefore pis odd, so pa=±a(since|a|= 4). Then ±a=−(qb+rc)∈ /an}bracketle{tb,c/an}bracketri}ht∼=
Z2×Z2. This is impossible, since |a|= 4.
Subcase 1.3. Assume S={a,b,c,d}, where |a|=|b|=|c|=|d|= 2.We may assume,
without loss of generality, that a+z=bandc+z=d, and also, since Xis not bipartite, that
a+b+c= 0. But then
c=a+b=a+(a+z) = 0+z=z,sod=c+z=c+c= 0,
which contradicts the fact that |d|= 2.
Assumption A. In the remaining cases of the proof, we assume that Xis nontrivially unstable.AUTOMORPHISMS OF THE CANONICAL DOUBLE COVER OF A TOROIDAL GR ID 11
Case 2. AssumeGis cyclic. We see from Theorem 2.9 that Xis listed in either (1) or (2) (with
m= 1).
Case 3. Assume that Scontains at least one element of order 2.If every element of Shas
order 2, then (since Xis not bipartite) it is not diﬃcult to see that Xis the Cayley graph K4/squareK2
that is listed in (4a).
Therefore, we may assume that Scontains precisely two elements of order 2, so we may write
S={a,b,±c}, where|a|=|b|= 2 and |c| ≥3. Since /an}bracketle{tc/an}bracketri}hthas at most one element of order 2, we
have|/an}bracketle{ta,b/an}bracketri}ht∩/an}bracketle{tc/an}bracketri}ht| ∈ {1,2}. Letn=|c|.
Subcase 3.1. Assume|/an}bracketle{ta,b/an}bracketri}ht∩/an}bracketle{tc/an}bracketri}ht|= 1.Then
X∼=Cn/squareC4∼=Cay/parenleftbig
Zn×Z4;±(1,0),±(0,1)/parenrightbig
.
This Cayley graph has no elements of order 2 in the generating set, so it is considered in a later
case. Also note that nmust be odd, since Xis not bipartite. Then it is not diﬃcult to see that
this Cayley graph is not listed in any of the parts of the state ment of the theorem, so it is stable.
Subcase 3.2. Assume |/an}bracketle{ta,b/an}bracketri}ht ∩ /an}bracketle{tc/an}bracketri}ht|= 2, but/an}bracketle{tc/an}bracketri}ht ∩ {a,b}=∅.ThenXis a prism with 2 n
vertices, plus an edge from each vertex to its antipodal vert ex. (Note that nmust be even, since
/an}bracketle{tc/an}bracketri}hthas a subgroup of order 2.) Therefore, it is not diﬃcult to see thatX∼=Cay(G′;±x,±y), where
G′=/an}bracketle{tx,y|4x=ny= 0,2x= (n/2)y, x+y=y+x/an}bracketri}ht.
The generating set of this abelian Cayley graph has no elemen ts of order 2, so the Cayley graph is
considered in a later case. Since Xis not bipartite, n/2 must be odd. Therefore, it is not diﬃcult
to see that this Cayley graph is not listed in any of the parts o f the statement of the theorem, so
it is stable.
Subcase 3.3. Assume/an}bracketle{ta,b/an}bracketri}ht∩/an}bracketle{tc/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht.ThenX∼=Mn/squareK2is listed in (4).
Assumption B. In the remaining cases of the proof, we assume that Shas no elements of order 2.
Therefore, we may write
S={±a,±b}, where|a|,|b|>2.
Case 4. Assume there is a group automorphism αofG×Z2, such that αis an automorphism
ofBX, andα(0,1)/ne}ationslash= (0,1).SinceG×{0}andG×{1}are the bipartition sets of BX, we know
that each of these sets is α-invariant. Therefore
•α(g,0) =/parenleftbig
ϕ(g),0/parenrightbig
, for some automorphism ϕofG, and
•α(0,1) = (z,1), for some element zof order 2.
Sinceαis an automorphism of BX, we must have α/parenleftbig
S×{1}/parenrightbig
=S×{1}, soϕ(S) =S+z. Therefore
ϕis an isomorphism from Cay( G;S) to Cay( G;S+z).
We may assume (by interchanging aandb, if necessary) that |b|is divisible by (at least) the
largest power of 2 that divides |a|. By Theorem 2.7 (and Assumption A), this implies that
|b|is even.
Let
m=|G:/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht|.
Thenma∈ /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht, so we may choose r∈ {0,1,...,|b|−1}, such that
ma+rb= 0.
SinceXis not bipartite, we know that
m+ris odd.
Subcase 4.1. Assumeϕ(b)∈ {±b+z}.Sinceϕis a homomorphism (and |z|= 2), this implies
thatϕ/parenleftbig
{±b}/parenrightbig
={±b+z}. Then, since ϕis a bijection from StoS+z, we must have ϕ(a) =ǫa+z,12 DAVE WITTE MORRIS
for some ǫ∈ {±1}. We may assume, without loss of generality, that ϕ(b) =b+z(by composing
with the automorphism x/mapsto→ −x, if necessary). Then
0 =ϕ(ma+rb) ( ma+rb= 0)
=mϕ(a)+rϕ(b) ( ϕis a group automorphism)
=m(ǫa+z)+r(b+z)
=ǫma+rb+z (|z|= 2 and m+ris odd).
Ifǫ= 1, then ǫma+rb=ma+rb= 0, soz= 0, which contradicts the fact that |z|= 2.
Therefore, we must have ǫ=−1, so−ma+rb=z. Subtracting this from the equation ma+rb=
0, we conclude that 2 ma=zhas order 2, so mahas order 4. Thus, the Cayley graph is listed
in (1).
Subcase 4.2. Assume ϕ(b)∈ {±a+z}.We may assume, without loss of generality, that
ϕ(b) =a+z(by composing with the automorphism x/mapsto→ −x, if necessary). We have ϕ(a) =ǫb+z,
for some ǫ∈ {±1}.
Note that |b|=|ϕ(b)|=|a+z|. Therefore, either |b|= 2|a|(and|a|is odd) or |b|=|a|. Hence,
gcd/parenleftbig
|b|,r/parenrightbig
∈ {m,2m}. Ifmis even, this implies that ris also even, which contradicts the fact that
m+ris odd. Therefore mis odd, so ris even. Hence, we must have gcd/parenleftbig
|b|,r/parenrightbig
= 2m, so we may
write
|b|= 2kmandr= 2ℓm, for some k,ℓ∈Z.
We have
0 =ϕ(ma+rb) ( ma+rb= 0)
=mϕ(a)+rϕ(b) ( ϕis a group automorphism)
=m(ǫb+z)+r(a+z)
=ra+ǫmb+z (|z|= 2 and m+ris odd)
= 2ℓma+ǫmb+z (deﬁnition of ℓ).
We also have
2ℓma+4ℓ2mb= 2ℓ(ma+rb) = 2ℓ(0) = 0,
so, by subtracting these two equations, we conclude that (4 ℓ2−ǫ)mb=z. Since|b|= 2km, and
|z|= 2, then 4 ℓ2≡ǫ(modk). Thus, the Cayley graph is listed in (2).
Remark. The remaining cases are copied almost verbatim from the anal ogous cases in [7, proof
of Thm. 4.3].
Case 5. Assume 2s/ne}ationslash= 2t, for all s,t∈S, such that s/ne}ationslash=t.By Lemma 2.12, there is an
automorphism αofBXthat ﬁxes (0 ,0), but does not ﬁx (0 ,1). We may assume αis not a
group automorphism, for otherwise Case 4 applies. Therefor e, Proposition 2.17 implies there exist
s,t,u,v∈Ssuch that s+t=u+v/ne}ationslash= 0 and {s,t} /ne}ationslash={u,v}. From the assumption of this case, we
see that this implies 3 b=±a(perhaps after interchanging awithb). Then
G=/an}bracketle{ta,b/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{t3b,b/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}htis cyclic,
so Case 2 applies.
Case 6. The remaining case. Since Case 5 does not apply, we have 2 s= 2t, for some s,t∈S,
such that s/ne}ationslash=t.
Subcase 6.1. Assume that t=−s.Then|s|= 4. Therefore, if we assume, without loss of
generality, that s=a, then we have i:=|/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht∩/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht| ∈ {1,2,4}. In all cases, we will show that Gis
cyclic, so Case 2 applies.AUTOMORPHISMS OF THE CANONICAL DOUBLE COVER OF A TOROIDAL GR ID 13
Ifi= 1, then G=/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht×/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht. SinceXis not bipartite, this implies |b|is odd, so gcd/parenleftbig
|a|,|b|/parenrightbig
= 1.
Therefore Gis cyclic.
Ifi= 2, then there is some k∈Z, such that a2=bk. SinceXis not bipartite, we know kis odd.
So/an}bracketle{ta2/an}bracketri}hthas odd index in /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht. This implies that /an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}hthas odd index in Gand is therefore a Sylow
2-subgroup. So the Sylow 2-subgroup of Gis cyclic. All of the other Sylow subgroups of Gare
contained in /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht, and are therefore also cyclic. So Gis an abelian group whose Sylow subgroups
are cyclic. Therefore Gis cyclic.
Ifi= 4, then a∈ /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht, soG=/an}bracketle{ta,b/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}htis cyclic.
Subcase 6.2. Assume that t/ne}ationslash=−s.Therefore, we may assume s=aandt=b, so 2a= 2b.
If we let z=b−a, this implies that 2 z= 0, soz=−z. Thena=b+zandb=a−z=a+z, so
S=S+z, which contradicts the assumption that Cay( G:S) is nontrivially unstable (and therefore
has no twin vertices). /square4.Some unstable abelian Cayley graphs of valency 6
In this section, we prove the following theorem, which impli es Theorem 1.6. (Although the title
of this section speciﬁes “valency 6, ” the theorem also appli es to some graphs of smaller valency,
becausea,b, and/or cmay have order 2.)
(4.1)Theorem. Let{a,b,c}be a generating set of a ﬁnite abelian group G, such that
a+b+c= 0and the sets {±a},{±b},{±c}are distinct.
The Cayley graph X= Cay(G;±a,±b,±c)is unstable if and only if one of the following conditions
is satisﬁed (perhaps after permuting a,b, andc):
(1)|a|= 4and|G|is divisible by 8.
(2) 2a= 2band|G|is divisible by 8.
(3)|a|= 8andb= 3a.
(4)|a|= 12andb= 4a.
(5)|a|=|b|= 3.
Before proving this theorem, let us show that it implies Theo rem 1.6.
Proof of Theorem 1.6. As in the proof of Theorem 1.5, we use Lemma 2.3. We will show th at
the graphs in Theorem 1.6 are precisely those that arise from Theorem 4.1 (and are not the two
trivially unstable graphs in Remark 1.8(d)), and satisfy th e additional assumption that m,n≥2
(wheren=|b|andm=|G:/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht|). Todothis, weconsider each part ofthestatement ofTheore m4.1
individually. We also consider appropriate permutations o fa,b, andc. This is made easier by the
observation that Corollary 2.4 determines the result of int erchanging awithc.
(1) Since |a|= 4, we must have m∈ {1,2,4}. Since|G|is divisible by 8, but |a|is not, we know
thatnandrare even.
•Ifm= 4, then r= 0 (because ma= 4a= 0). This yields the graph Tr(4 ,2k,0) of 1.6(4).
By Corollary 2.4, this is isomorphic to Tr(4 ,2k,4).
By using ain the role of bin Lemma 2.3, we obtain Tr(2 k,4,0), which is also listed
in 1.6(4). If kis even, then applying Corollary 2.4 does not give anything n ew. However,
ifkis odd, then this graph is isomorphic to Tr(2 k,4,2), as mentioned at the end of the
statement of Theorem 1.6.
•Ifm= 2, then r=n/2 (because ma= 2ahas order 2). Since ris even, this yields the
graph Tr(2 ,4k,2k) of 1.6(3). By Corollary 2.4, this is isomorphic to Tr(2 ,4k,2−2k) =
Tr(2,4k,2k+2).
By using ain the role of bin Lemma 2.3, we obtain Tr(2 k,4,2), which is also listed
in 1.6(3). If kis even, then, as above, applying Corollary 2.4 does not give anything new.
However, if kis odd, then this graph is isomorphic to Tr(2 k,4,0), as mentioned at the end
of the statement of Theorem 1.6.
•Ifm= 1, then we cannot directly apply Lemma 2.3, because the deﬁn ition of Tr( m,n,r)
requires m >1.
However, we may use ain the role of b. This yields Tr(2 k,4,r), and we have r∈ {±1}
because/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht=G(sincem= 1). Therefore, the graph is listed in 1.6(5). If kis even, then
the two graphs are isomorphic (by Corollary 2.4), as mention ed at the end of the statement
of Theorem 1.6. The graph Tr(2 ,4,1) is trivially unstable (see Remark 1.8), so we require
k >1 in Tr(2 k,4,1).
(2) Write |G|= 8k.
14AUTOMORPHISMS OF THE CANONICAL DOUBLE COVER OF A TOROIDAL GR ID 15
•Suppose, for the moment, that /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht=G. Since 2 a= 2b, buta/ne}ationslash=b, we must have a=
(4k+1)b. Thenaandbboth generate G, so neither can play the role of bin Lemma 2.3.
However, we may let cplay this role. Note that c=−(a+b) =−(4k+2)b= (4k−2)b, so
|G:/an}bracketle{tc/an}bracketri}ht|= 2 and
2a= 2b= (2k−1)(4k−2)b= (2k−1)c,
so this yields the graph Tr/parenleftbig
2,4k,−(2k−1)/parenrightbig
= Tr(2,4k,2k+ 1), which is listed in 1.6(2).
Applying Corollary 2.4 to this graph does not yield anything new.
•We may now assume /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht /ne}ationslash=G. Then, since 2 a= 2b, we have m=r= 2 and n=|G|/m=
8k/2 = 4k. So this yields the graph Tr(2 ,4k,−2) of 1.6(1). By Corollary 2.4, this is
isomorphic to Tr(2 ,4k,4).
Note that 4 a= 2a+2a= 2a+2b= 2(a+b) =−2c. Therefore, by using cin the role
ofb, we obtain the graph Tr(4 ,2k,2) of 1.6(1). Applying Corollary 2.4 to this graph does
not give us anything new.
(3) Since /an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht=G, neither anorbcan play the role of bin Lemma 2.3. Letting cplay
the role of byields the graph Tr(4 ,2,1) (because c=−(a+b) =−4ahas order 2). This is listed
in 1.6(6). Applying Corollary 2.4 to this graph does not yiel d anything new.
(4) Since G=/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht, we have |G|=|a|= 12. Then n=|b|= 3 and m=|G|/|b|= 4. Also,
ma= 4a=b, sor= 1. Therefore, we have the graph Tr(4 ,3,−1) of 1.6(6). Applying Corollary 2.4
to this graph does not yield anything new.
Since/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tc/an}bracketri}ht=G, neither anorccan play the role of bin Lemma 2.3.
(5) This graph is trivially unstable (see Lemma 4.2(2)). /square
To shorten the main argument, we establish three minor resul ts that deal with parts of the proof
of Theorem 4.1.
(4.2)Lemma. Let{a,b,c}be a generating set of a ﬁnite abelian group G, such that
a+b+c= 0and the sets {±a},{±b},{±c}are distinct.
The Cayley graph X= Cay(G;±a,±b,±c)has twin vertices (or, equivalently, is trivially unstable )
if and only if (perhaps after permuting a,b, andc)either:
(1)|a|= 8andb= 2a, or
(2)|a|=|b|= 3.
In each case, the Cayley graph is listed in Theorem 4.1.
Proof.(⇐) Up to a group isomorphism, Xis either Cay( Z8;S8) or Cay( Z3×Z3;S3), where
S8={±1,±2,±3}andS3={±(1,0),±(0,1),±(1,1)}.
We have S8=S8+ 4 and S3=S3+ (−1,1), so both Cayley graphs have twin vertices, and are
therefore trivially unstable.
Since 2 is an element of order 4 in Z8, the ﬁrst Cayley graph is listed in 4.1(1). The second is
listed in 4.1(5).
(⇒) LetS={±a,±b,±c}. SinceXhas twin vertices, we see from Remark 2.13 that Sis a
union of cosets of some subgroup /an}bracketle{tz/an}bracketri}htof prime order. Since |S| ≤6, we must have |z| ∈ {2,3,5}.
Case 1. Assume |z|= 2.Then−s+z=−(s+z) for alls∈S, so the permutation x/mapsto→x+z
induces a well-deﬁned action on/braceleftbig
{±a},{±b},{±c}/bracerightbig
. Since the permutation has order 2, this
impliess+z=−sfor some s∈S. Assume without loss of generality that s=a, so|a|= 4 and
z= 2a.
Ifb+z=−b, then we also have c+z=−c, so
0 =−(a+b+c) = (a+z)+(b+z)+(c+z) = (a+b+c)+z= 0+z=z,
which contradicts the fact that |z|= 2.16 DAVE WITTE MORRIS
Therefore, we must have b+z=±c, soa+b±(b+z) = 0.
•For the minus sign, we have 0 = a+b−(b+z) =a+z. This contradicts the fact that
|a|= 4/ne}ationslash=|z|.
•For the plus sign, we have 0 = a+2b+z=−a+2b, soa= 2b. Since|a|= 4, this implies
|b|= 8, soXis the Cayley graph in (1).
Case 2. Assume |z|= 3.This implies |S|= 6, so no element of Shas order 2. Therefore, if C
is any coset of /an}bracketle{tz/an}bracketri}ht, thenC/ne}ationslash=−C(since|C|is odd). Since the cosets form a partition, we conclude
thatC∩−C=∅. Hence, we may assume that Ccontains a,b, and±c. Then
0 =a+(a+z)±(a+2z),
so either 3 a= 0 ora=z. However, a/ne}ationslash=z, since 0 /∈S. Therefore 3 a= 0, which means |a|= 3.
Sincezalso has order 3, Xis the Cayley graph in (2).
Case 3.Assume|z|= 5.Then|S|= 5, sosomeelement sofShasorder2. Since G=/an}bracketle{tS/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{ts,z/an}bracketri}ht,
this implies |G|= 10. More precisely, upto a group isomorphism, wehave X= Cay(Z10;±1,±3,5).
However, it is not possible to choose representatives of {±1},{±3}, and{5}whose sum is 0, so
this case is not possible. /square
(4.3)Lemma. All of the Cayley graphs listed in the statement of Theorem 4.1 a re unstable.
Proof.(1)(Wilson[16, Thms.T.2andT.3, p.381])Let z= 2a, anddeﬁne ϕ:G→Gbyϕ(pa+qb) =
pa+q(b+z). Since |a|= 4, we have |z|= 2, soϕis well-deﬁned. (Since |G|is divisible by 8, but
|a|is not, and /an}bracketle{ta,b/an}bracketri}ht=G, we know that |/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht:/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht∩/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht|is even. Therefore, if p1a+q1b=p2a+q2b,
thenq1≡q2(mod 2), so p1a+q1(b+z) =p2a+q2(b+z).) Then it is easy to see that ϕis an
automorphism of G. Also, we have
ϕ(a) =a=−3a=−a+2a=−a+z,
soϕ(S) =S+z. Hence, ϕis an isomorphism from Cay( G;S) to Cay( G;S+z). This implies
Cay(G;S) is unstable (see Lemma 2.14).
(2) (Wilson [16, Thm. T.1, p. 381]) There is an automorphism ϕofGthat interchanges aandb
(and ﬁxes c). Thenϕ(S) =S, soϕis an automorphism of Cay( G;S). Also note that ϕﬁxes each
element of the index-2 subgroup /an}bracketle{t2a,c/an}bracketri}ht.
•If/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht /ne}ationslash=G, then the subgraph induced by the set of un-ﬁxed vertices con sists of two cycles
of length |c|, and these two cycles are interchanged by ϕ. Since|c|=|a|/2 =|G|/4 is even,
these cycles are bipartite. Therefore Cay( G;S) is unstable by Lemma 2.15.
•If/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht=G, then (since |G|is divisible by 8) we may assume G=Z8kanda= 1. Since
2a= 2b, we know that b−ahas order 2, and is therefore equal to 4 k. Hence S=
{±1,4k±1,4k±2}, so we see that Xis unstable by letting a= 4k+ 2 and b= 1 in
Theorem 2.11(4).
(3) We have X∼=Cay(Z8;±1,±3,4), which is unstable by Theorem 2.10(2).
(4) Since X∼=Cay(Z12;±1,±4,±5) = Cay( Z12;±1,±4,±7), we see that it is unstable from
Theorem 4.1(4) with k= 3 and a= 4.
(5)Xis trivially unstable by Lemma 4.2(2). /square
(4.4)Lemma. LetS={±1,±b,±(b+1)}, for some b∈Zn, such that b /∈ {0,±1,−2}(so the sets
{±1},{±b},{±(b+1)}are distinct ). IfCay(Zn;S)is unstable, then it is listed in Theorem 4.1.
Proof.LetX= Cay(Zn;S). We may assume Xis nontrivially unstable, for otherwise Lemma 4.2
applies. Also, since cyclic groups have no more than one elem ent of order 2, we know that theAUTOMORPHISMS OF THE CANONICAL DOUBLE COVER OF A TOROIDAL GR ID 17
valency of Xis either 5 or 6. Therefore, the Cayley graph Xis listed in either Theorem 2.10 or
Theorem 2.11.
Case 1.AssumeXis listed in Theorem 2.10. In 2.10(1), one generator is odd, but the other two
generators are even, so a+b+c/ne}ationslash≡0 (mod 2). Hence, the equation a+b+c= 0 is not satisﬁed.
SoXmust the graph in 2.10(2), which is listed in 4.1(3).
Case 2. Assume Xis listed in Theorem 2.11. We consider each of the seven lists of graphs
individually.
2.11(1): The element 2 khas order 4, so Xis listed in 4.1(1).
2.11(2): The generator ±ais odd, but ±band±b+2kare even, so the equation a+b+c= 0
is not satisﬁed.
2.11(3): For some choice of the signs, we must have ±a±(a+k)±(a−k)= 0, so 3 a≡0 (modk).
Sincekis odd and we also have a≡0 (mod 4), this implies 3 a= 0 inZ4k. But since 1 is in the
generating set, we must also have a−k=±1 (perhaps after replacing awith−a). Soa∈ {k±1}.
Therefore 3 k±3 = 3a≡0 (mod 4 k). From this (and the fact that a/ne}ationslash= 0), we conclude that k= 3.
Sincek±1 =a≡0 (mod 4), we see that a= 4, soXis listed in 4.1(4).
2.11(4): For some c∈ {4k±b}, we have ±a+b+c= 0. However, if c= 4k−b, then this implies
a= 4k, which contradicts the fact that |a|is divisible by 4. Therefore, we must have c= 4k+b.
Then 2b= 2c, so this Cayley graph is listed in 4.1(2).
2.11(5): The condition a+b+c= 0 implies a≡0 (modk), so all of the elements of Sare
divisible by k. Since 1 ∈S, we conclude that k= 1, son= 8. Since a≡0 (mod 4), this implies
a= 4. So Xis the Cayley graph in 4.1(3). (Alternatively, we have |a|= 2, which contradicts the
fact that the valency of Xis assumed to be 6 in the current case.)
2.11(6): Sincemis odd, we know that bandmb+2khave the same parity. Hence, the equation
a+b+c= 0 implies that ais even, so a/ne}ationslash=±1. Therefore, we may assume 1 ∈ {b,mb+2k}. Since
the assumptions imply m2b≡ ±b(andmis odd), we have ±b=m(mb+2k) +2k, so there is no
harm in assuming b= 1.
Sincem2≡1 (mod 4), we know that m2+1/ne}ationslash≡0 (mod 4), so ( m2+1)b=m2+1/ne}ationslash≡0 (mod 4 k).
Therefore, we must have m2≡1 (mod 4 k).
For an appropriate choice of the sign (and perhaps replacing awith its negative), we have
−a±b+(mb+2k) = 0, so
a=mb+2k±b=m+2k±1.
However,
(m−1)(m+2k+1) =m2−1+(m−1)(2k)≡1−1+0 = 0 /ne}ationslash≡2k≡(m−1)a(mod 4k).
Soa/ne}ationslash=m+2k+1. Hence, we must have
a=m+2k−1.
Then, modulo 4 k, we have
2k≡(m−1)a= (m−1)(m+2k−1) =m2−2m+1+(m−1)(2k)≡1−2m+1+0 = −2(m−1).
This means m≡k+1 (mod 2 k), somis either k+1 or−k+1.
Sincemis odd, this implies that kis even, so |Z4k|is divisible by 8. It also implies that ais
either 3kork. In either case, ahas order 4. So Xis listed in 4.1(1).
2.11(7): Ifa= 1, then m= 4k+ 1, sobandcmust be even, which contradicts the equation
a+b+c= 0.
Thus, we may assume b= 1. Then m= 4k−1, soa≡2k(mod 4k), which means a∈ {±2k}.
Therefore ahas order 4, so the Cayley graph is listed in 4.1(1). /square
As ﬁnal preparation for proof of Theorem 4.1, let us recall so me useful notation.18 DAVE WITTE MORRIS
(4.5)Notation (cf. [6, Defn. 2.3], [9, Notn. 2.5]) .Assume X= Cay(G;S) is an abelian Cayley
graph.
(1) Forg∈G, let/tildewideg= (g,1), soBX= Cay(G×Z2;/tildewideS).
(2) Fors1,...,sℓ∈S, and a starting point v∈V(BX), we use ( /tildewides1,/tildewides2,...,/tildewidesℓ) to denote
the walk v, v+/tildewides1, v+/tildewides1+/tildewides2, ..., v+/tildewides1+/tildewides2+···+/tildewidesℓinBX.
(3) (/tildewides1m1,/tildewides2m2,...,/tildewidesℓmℓ) denotes the sequence consisting of m1copies of /tildewides1, followed by m2
copies of /tildewides2, followed by ..., followed by mℓcopies of /tildewidesℓ.
Proof of Theorem 4.1. (⇐) See Lemma 4.3.
(⇒) LetS={±a,±b,±c}, soX= Cay(G;S). Assuming that Xis unstable, we will show that
(at least) one of the listed conditions is satisﬁed. Note tha t, since the equation a+b+c= 0 is
completely symmetric, we are free to permute the elements of {a,b,c}arbitrarily.
By Lemma 2.12, we may let αbe an automorphism of BXthat ﬁxes (0 ,0), but does not ﬁx
(0,1). Since G×{0}andG×{1}are the bipartition sets of BX, we know that each of these sets
isα-invariant.
Case 1. Assume|G|is odd.By Theorem 2.7, we know that Xis trivially unstable. Therefore,
Lemma 4.2 applies.
Case 2. AssumeG=/an}bracketle{ts/an}bracketri}htfor some s∈S.See Lemma 4.4.
Case 3. Assume |c|= 2.We may assume Case 2 does not apply; therefore c /∈ /an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht. If we let
n=|a|, then
X∼=Cay/parenleftbig
Zn×Z2;±(1,0),±(1,1),(0,1)/parenrightbig
.
•Ifn≥8, then Proposition 2.16 tells us that Xis stable.
•Ifn≤7, andn/ne}ationslash= 4, then Lemma 2.22 tells us that Xis stable.
•Ifn= 4, then |a|= 4 and |G|= 8, so condition (1) is satisﬁed.
Assumption C. Henceforth, we assume |s| ≥3for alls∈S(soXhas valency 6), and|G|is
even.
Case 4. Assume |s|= 4, for some s∈S.We may assume |G|= 4k, where kis odd, for
otherwise condition (1) is satisﬁed. Then Gis cyclic (since |a|= 4 and G//an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}htis generated by b).
We may also assume that Xis nontrivially unstable, for otherwise Lemma 4.2 applies. ThenX
must be listed in Theorem 2.11. More precisely, since |G|is not divisible by 8, it must be listed in
2.11(2), 2.11(3), or 2.11(6). We will look at each of these po ssibilities separately (similarly to how
these cases were considered in the proof of Lemma 4.4).
2.11(2): Since the generator ±ais odd, but the other two are even, the equation a+b+c= 0
cannot be satisﬁed.
2.11(3): SinceSmust contain the element kof order 4, but a≡0 (mod 4), we must have
a+k=kora+k=−kora−k=kora−k=−k,
soa∈ {0,2k}. However, we know a/ne}ationslash= 0. And a/ne}ationslash= 2k, because 2 k/ne}ationslash≡0 (mod 4) (or because we are
assuming that no element of Shas order 2).
2.11(6): Sincemis odd, we know that bandmb+ 2khave the same parity. Therefore, the
equation a+b+c= 0 implies that ais even. So a/ne}ationslash=±k. Then{±b,±mb+2k}contains k, and
is therefore contained in /an}bracketle{tk/an}bracketri}ht. This is impossible, because /an}bracketle{tk/an}bracketri}htdoes not contain 4 distinct nonzero
elements.
Case 5. Assumeαis a group automorphism. Then
•α(g,0) =/parenleftbig
ϕ(g),0/parenrightbig
, for some automorphism ϕofG, and
•α(0,1) = (z,1), for some element zof order 2.AUTOMORPHISMS OF THE CANONICAL DOUBLE COVER OF A TOROIDAL GR ID 19
Then, since α/parenleftbig
S×{1}/parenrightbig
=S×{1}, we have ϕ(S) =S+z, soϕis an isomorphism from Cay( G;S)
to Cay(G;S+z).
We have ϕ(s)∈ ±{a,b,c}+zfor alls∈ {a,b,c}. At least two elements of Smust use the
same sign, which implies there exists ǫ∈ {0,1}, such that ϕ(S) contains at least two elements of
{ǫa+z,ǫb+z,ǫc+z}. We may assume ǫ= 1 (by composing with the automorphism x/mapsto→ −xif
necessary). Then, by permuting {a,b,c}, we may assume that a+zandb+zare inϕ({a,b,c}).
Therefore
0 =ϕ(a+b+c) =ϕ(a)+ϕ(b)+ϕ(c) = (a+z)+(b+z)±(c+z) = (a+b)±c+z=−c±c+z.
Sincez/ne}ationslash= 0, we conclude that 2 c=z, sochas order 4. Therefore, Case 4 applies.
Case 6. Assume 2s/ne}ationslash= 2t, for all s,t∈S, such that s/ne}ationslash=t.We may assume αis not a
group automorphism, for otherwise Case 5 applies. Therefor e, Proposition 2.17 implies there exist
s,t,u,v∈Ssuch that s+t=u+v/ne}ationslash= 0 and {s,t} /ne}ationslash={u,v}. From the assumption of this case, we
see that this implies either 3 a=±cor 2a=±b±c(perhaps after permuting a,b, andc).
•If 3a=±c, thenc=±3a∈ /an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht, soG=/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht. Therefore Case 2 applies.
•If 2a=±b−c=±b+(a+b), thena=±b+b∈ /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht, soG=/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht. Therefore Case 2 applies.
So we may assume
2a=±b+c=±b−(a+b)∈ {−a,−a−2b},
so 3a∈ {0,−2b}.
•If 3a=−2b, thena=−2a−2b=−2(a+b) = 2c∈ /an}bracketle{tc/an}bracketri}ht, soG=/an}bracketle{tc/an}bracketri}ht. Therefore Case 2
applies.
Hence, we may assume
3a= 0, so|a|= 3.
We may also assume a /∈ /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht, for otherwise Case 2 applies. So /an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht ∩ /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht={0}. This implies
G=/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht×/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht, so, letting n=|b|, we have
X∼=Cay/parenleftbig
Z3×Zn;±(1,0),±(0,1),±(1,1)/parenrightbig
.
Note that:
•(/tildewidea3) and (/tildewidea−3) are paths of length 3 in BXfrom (0,0) to/tildewide0 = (0,1),
•(/tildewideb3) and (/tildewidec−3) are paths of length 3 in BXfrom (0,0) to 3/tildewideb, and
•(/tildewideb−3) and (/tildewidec3) are paths of length 3 in BXfrom (0,0) to 3/tildewidec.
Also note that if s1,s2, ands3are not all equal to each other, then the number of permutatio ns
of the list ( /tildewides1,/tildewides2,/tildewides3) is divisible by 3. Therefore, /tildewide0, 3/tildewideb, and 3/tildewidecare the only vertices of BXfor
which the number of paths of length 3 from (0 ,0) to the vertex is not divisible by 3. Hence, the
set{/tildewide0,3/tildewideb,3/tildewidec}isα-invariant.
We may assume |b|>12, for otherwise Lemma 2.24 applies. Then the number of path s of
length 6 from 3 /tildewidec=−3/tildewidebto 3/tildewidebis/parenleftbig6
3/parenrightbig
+2:
•/parenleftbig6
3/parenrightbig
permutations of the path ( /tildewideb3,/tildewidec−3), and
•the paths ( /tildewideb6) and (/tildewidec−6).
This is much smaller than the number of paths of length 6 from /tildewide0 to either 3 /tildewidebor 3/tildewidec. For example,
paths from /tildewide0 to 3/tildewidebinclude:
•/parenleftbig6
3/parenrightbig
permutations of the path ( /tildewidea3,/tildewideb3),
•/parenleftbig6
3/parenrightbig
permutations of the path ( /tildewidea3,/tildewidec−3), and
•others.20 DAVE WITTE MORRIS
Thus, the vertex (0 ,1) =/tildewide0 is uniquely determined as an element of the α-invariant set {/tildewide0,3/tildewideb,3/tildewidec},
so it must be ﬁxed by α. This contradicts the choice of α.
Case 7. The remaining case. Since Case 6 does not apply, we have 2 s= 2t, for some s,t∈S,
such that s/ne}ationslash=t. Since Case 4 does not apply, we know s/ne}ationslash=−t. Therefore, we may assume s=a
andt∈ {±b}, so 2a∈ {±2b}. However, if 2 a=−2b, then
2c=−2(a+b) =−(2a+2b) =−(−2b+2b) =−0 = 0,
so Case 3 applies. Thus, we must have 2 a= 2b. Sob=a+zfor some element zof order 2.
We may assume G/ne}ationslash=/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}htandG/ne}ationslash=/an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht(otherwise, Case 2 applies), so b /∈ /an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}htanda /∈ /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht. Hence
z/∈ /an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}htandz/∈ /an}bracketle{tb/an}bracketri}ht. So
X∼=Cay/parenleftbig
Zn×Z2;±(1,0),±(1,1),±(2,1)/parenrightbig
,
wheren=|a|=|b|is even and, up to a group isomorphism, a= (1,0),b= (1,1), andc=−(2,1).
We may assume Xdoes not satisfy condition (2), so
n/2 is odd.
Also, since Case 4 (and Case 3) does not apply, we have n >4. In addition, since Case 6 does not
apply, we know 2 a/ne}ationslash=−2c, son/ne}ationslash= 6. Therefore (since 8 /2 is not odd), we have
n >8.
Note that, for every v∈V(BX), the fact that 2 a= 2bimplies that v+2/tildewidecandv−2/tildewidecare the
only vertices of BXthat are joined to vby auniquepath of length 2. It follows from this that
α(v+k/tildewidec) =α(v)±k/tildewidec, for all k∈Zand allv∈V(BX). (4.6)
Sinceαﬁxes 0, we conclude that {±k/tildewidec}isα-invariant, for all k∈Z.
LetYbe the spanning subgraph of BXthat is obtained by removing all edges of the form
(v,v+/tildewidec). By (4.6), we know that Yisα-invariant, so αis an automorphism of Y.
Now,/tildewide(0,0) and/tildewide(0,1) are the only vertices that are at distance 2 from both /tildewidecand−/tildewidecinY. Since
{±/tildewidec}isα-invariant, this implies that/braceleftbig/tildewide(0,0),/tildewide(0,1)/bracerightbig
is alsoα-invariant.
Since|/tildewidec|=n, we have ( n/2)/tildewidec=−(n/2)/tildewidec. Therefore, we see from (4.6) that ( n/2)/tildewidecis ﬁxed by α.
However, since n/2 is odd, we have
/tildewide(0,1) =n
2/tildewide(2,1) =n
2/tildewidec.
Hence,/tildewide(0,1) is ﬁxed by α. Therefore, since /tildewide(0,0) is the only other element of the invariant set/braceleftbig/tildewide(0,0),/tildewide(0,1)/bracerightbig
, we conclude that /tildewide(0,0) is also ﬁxed by α. This contradicts the choice of α./squareReferences
