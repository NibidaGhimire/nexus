Thisthesiscollectsthematerialdevelopedinthecourseofthreelinesofinvestigationconcerning
arithmetic and algebraic aspects of rational elliptic surfaces. We organize the text as follows.
In Chapter 1 we present the three lines of investigation and explain their connection with one
another. In short, they are:
1. Over an algebraically closed ﬁeld, classify the ﬁbers of conic bundles on rational elliptic
surfaces and describe the interplay between the ﬁbers of the elliptic ﬁbration and the ﬁbers
of the conic bundle.
2. Given a rational elliptic surface over an algebraically closed ﬁeld, investigate the numbers
that cannot occur as the intersection number of a pair of sections, which we call gap numbers .
More precisely, try to answer when gap numbers exist, how they are distributed and how to
identify them.
3. Given a rational elliptic surface over a number ﬁeld, study the set of ﬁbers whose Mordell-
Weil rank is higher than the generic rank. More speciﬁcally, present conditions to guarantee
that the collection of ﬁbers where the rank jumps of at least 3 is not thin.
Chapter 2 is dedicated to establishing notations, deﬁnitions and well-known results on which
this work is based. The results related to each of the three topics mentioned receive an individual
chapter, namely Chapters 3, 4 and 5. The appendix in Chapter 6 stores data relevant to Chapter 4.
The results in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 also appear separately in the following preprints:

Introduction
The central object of this thesis are rational elliptic surfaces (see Deﬁnitions 2.1.1 and 2.2.3).
Our investigation stems from three motivating problems regarding both arithmetic and geometric
aspects of these surfaces. We introduce each problem in its particular context, explain our strategy
for approaching it and state our results.
From a historical perspective, elliptic surfaces emerge from number theoretic problems and
receive a progressively more geometric treatment over time. From the viewpoint of elliptic curves
over a function ﬁeld, they have ﬁrst been studied over a ﬁnite ﬁeld of constants by Artin [Art24] in
the search for an analogue of the Riemann Hypothesis, later proved in generality by Weil [Wei48].
In the framework of algebraic surfaces over the complex numbers, elliptic ﬁbrations were already
known to Enriques [Enr49], but only as a class of examples among others.
A much more dedicated treatment was given by Kodaira [Kod63a, Kod63b] using the language
of complex geometry, which laid the foundations for a profound study of elliptic surfaces. The
algebraic theory was soon advanced by Néron [Né64] and Shafarevich [SAV+65] and received an
important contribution from Tate [Tat75] with a simpliﬁed algorithm for identifying singular ﬁbers.
A key aspect of elliptic surfaces is the bijective correspondence between sections of the elliptic
ﬁbration and points on the generic ﬁber (Subsection 2.1.1), ﬁrst properly emphasized by Shioda
in [Shi72]. This correspondence is a fundamental ingredient in the construction of the Mordell-
Weil lattice (Section 2.7) by Shioda [Shi89] and Elkies [Elk90] independently. This proved to be a
powerful tool of both geometric and arithmetic interest, with applications in various topics such as
Galois representations, moduli spaces of K3 surfaces and crystallography.
Our focus on rational elliptic surfaces is due to their convenient geometric properties (Theo-
rem 2.2.6), the simplicity with which examples can be produced (Section 3.4) and the fact that
their possible ﬁber conﬁgurations and possible Mordell-Weil lattices have been completely classiﬁed
in [Per90] and [OS91] respectively.
In what follows Xis a geometrically rational elliptic surface with elliptic ﬁbration π:X→P1
over a ﬁeld kwhich is either a number ﬁeld or an algebraically closed ﬁeld. We let K:=k(P1)
be the function ﬁeld of the base curve P1and deﬁne the Mordell-Weil group ofπas the group
ofK-points on the generic ﬁber E, denoted by E(K). We note that every geometrically rational
elliptic surface admits precisely one elliptic ﬁbration (Proposition 2.2.6), hence we may refer to
E(K)as the Mordell-Weil group of the surface X. We userto denote the rank of E(K), called
theMordell-Weil rank orgeneric rank .
We present our three problems of interest.
81.1 Classiﬁcation of conic bundle ﬁbers
In a broad sense, a conic bundle can be understood as a genus zero ﬁbration on a variety (see
Deﬁnition 2.3.1 for surfaces). Conic bundles arise in diﬀerent forms in many important contexts,
from the classiﬁcation of k-minimal rational surfaces to the Minimal Model Program (Section 2.3
and Chapter 3 for a more precise account). In this thesis we are concerned more speciﬁcally with
conic bundles on a rational elliptic surface π:X→P1. This has been motivated by results from
[Sal12], [LS22], where the presence of conic bundles is used as a condition to guarantee that rank
jumps occur (Section 1.3 and Chapter 5); from [GS17, GS20], where conic bundles are used to
classify elliptic ﬁbrations on certain K3 surfaces; and from [AGL16], where conic bundles appear
in the study of generators of the Cox ring of X.
These applications seem to justify a further study of conic bundles on rational elliptic surfaces.
More speciﬁcally, we propose two questions: ﬁrst, in which ways can we construct a divisor Don
Xsuch that the linear system |D|induces a conic bundle on X? Second, to what extent is this
construction obstructed by the ﬁber conﬁguration of the elliptic ﬁbration?
Our starting point is an observation, already implicit in [AGL16], [GS17, GS20], that there is a
bijectivecorrespondencebetweenconicbundleson XandcertainNéron-Severiclasses [D]∈NS(X),
which we call conic classes (Deﬁnition 3.1.1), which indicates that all information we need can be
derived from the numerical behavior of a divisor Drepresenting a conic class.
We note that this study is essentially geometric, therefore it makes sense to work over an
algebraic closure of the base ﬁeld. Moreover, except for minor diﬃculties, there is no reason to
restrict ourselves to characteristic zero, which is the case in [Sal12, LS22] over number ﬁelds, in
[AGL16, GS17] over Cor in [GS20] over a ﬁeld of characteristic zero.
Our ﬁrst result is a complete classiﬁcation of the ﬁbers of a conic bundle on Xand answers our
ﬁrst question about the possibilities of Dsuch that|D|induces a conic bundle ϕ|D|:X→P1.
Theorem 3.2.2. Letπ:X→P1be a rational elliptic surface over an algebraically closed ﬁeld
and letϕ:X→P1be a conic bundle. If Dis a ﬁber of ϕ, then the intersection graph of D
(multiplicities considered) ﬁts one of the types below. Conversely, if the intersection graph of a
divisorDﬁts any of these types, then |D|induces a conic bundle ϕ|D|:X→P1.

Our second result answers our second question and consists in a precise description of the in-
terplay between ﬁbers of conic bundles on Xand the ﬁber conﬁguration of the elliptic ﬁbration.
We use Kodaira’s notation for the singular ﬁbers of π(see Theorem 2.1.8).
Theorem 3.3.2. LetXbe a rational elliptic surface with elliptic ﬁbration π:X→P1. Then
the following statements hold:
a)Xadmits a conic bundle with an A2ﬁber⇔πhas positive generic rank and no III∗ﬁber.
b)Xadmits a conic bundle with an An≥3ﬁber⇔πhas a reducible ﬁber distinct from II∗.
c)Xadmits a conic bundle with a D3ﬁber⇔πhas at least two reducible ﬁbers.
d)Xadmits a conic bundle with a Dm≥4ﬁber⇔πhas a nonreduced ﬁber or a ﬁber In≥4.
Theorems 3.2.2 and 3.3.2 are proven in Chapter 3 and, for the most part, are also the main
results in [Cosa].
101.2 Intersection gaps
We note that a complete proof of item a) in Theorem 3.3.2 is not possible without a detailed
study on how sections of π:X→P1intersect one another. Indeed, in order to answer precisely
whenXadmits a conic bundle with an A2ﬁber one must know precisely which rational elliptic
surfaces admit sections P1,P2∈E(K)such that the intersection number P1·P2is equal to 1.
This answer was not available at the time of [Cosa], hence only a partial version of item a) could
be proven in that context and the complete one remained as a conjecture. We present our next
investigation, which provides the tools to prove item a) and several other results.
We ask the following question: as P1,P2run through E(K), what values can P1·P2attain?
On surfaces in general, the computation of intersection numbers of curves can be a very diﬃcult
problem. In our case, however, we are only concerned with sections of an elliptic surface, which has
the additional advantage of being rational. The tool that allows us to attack this problem is the
Mordell-Weil lattice ,anotionﬁrstintroducedbyElkies[Elk90]andShioda[Shi89,Shi90]. Itinvolves
the deﬁnition of a Q-valued pairing on E(K), called the height pairing , which induces a positive-
deﬁnitelatticeonthequotient E(K)/E(K)tor, whichistheMordell-Weillattice(Section2.7). Akey
aspect of its construction is the connection with the Néron-Severi lattice, so that the height pairing
and the intersection pairing of sections are strongly intertwined. Fortunately, the possibilities for
the Mordell-Weil lattice on a rational elliptic surface have already been classiﬁed in [OS91], which
gives us a convenient starting point.
Another aspect of this investigation is the connection with a classic theme in number theory,
namely the representation of integers by positive-deﬁnite quadratic forms. Indeed, since E(K)has
rankr, its free part is generated by rterms, so the height h(P) :=/angbracketleftP,P/angbracketrightinduces a positive-deﬁnite
quadratic form on rvariables with coeﬃcients in Q. IfO∈E(K)is the neutral section and Ris
the set of reducible ﬁbers of π, then by the height formula (2.3)
h(P) = 2 + 2(P·O)−/summationdisplay
v∈Rcontrv(P),
where the sum over vis a rational number which can be easily estimated. By clearing denominators,
we see that the possible values of P·Odepend on a certain range of integers represented by a
positive-deﬁnite quadratic form with coeﬃcients in Z. This point of view is explored in some parts
of Chapter 4, where we apply results such as the classical Lagrange four-square theorem [HW79,
§20.5], the counting of integers represented by a binary quadratic form [Ber12, p. 91] and the more
recent Bhargava-Hanke’s 290-theorem on universal quadratic forms [BH, Thm. 1].
We say that k∈Z≥0is agap number ofX, or that or that Xhas ak-gapif there are no sections
P1·P2∈E(K)such thatP1·P2=k. We try to answer under which conditions gap numbers exist,
how they are distributed and try to identify them in some cases. Our ﬁrst result states that gap
numbers do not exist for a big enough Mordell-Weil rank.
Theorem 4.7.2. Ifr≥5, thenXhas no gap numbers.
On the other hand, if the rank is low enough, then gap numbers occur with probability 1.
11Theorem 4.7.4. Ifr≤2, then the set of gap numbers G:={k∈N|kis a gap number of X}
has density 1inN, i.e.
limn→∞#G∩{1,...,n}
n= 1.
As to the explicit identiﬁcation of gap numbers, we point out some cases where a complete
identiﬁcation is possible.
Theorem 4.7.7. IfE(K)is torsion-free with rank r= 1, then all the gap numbers of Xare
described below, according to the lattice Tassociated with the reducible ﬁbers of π(see Deﬁni-
tion 2.7.3).

Table 1.1: Description of gap numbers when E(K)is torsion-free with r= 1.
We conclude by ﬁxing k= 1and identifying all rational elliptic surfaces with a 1-gap. This
is tantamount to describing when Xadmits a conic bundle with an A2ﬁber, hence we solve our
motivating problem of proving item a) in Theorem 3.3.2.
Theorem 4.7.8. Xhas a 1-gap if and only if r= 0orr= 1andπhas aIII∗ﬁber.
The four theorems above are proven in Chapter 4 and are also the main results in [Cosb].
121.3 Large rank jumps and the Hilbert property
Letkbe a number ﬁeld. We address a prominent theme in Diophantine Geometry, namely the
variation of the Mordell-Weil rank of a ﬁber π−1(t)astvaries in P1
k. In the search for elliptic curves
with large rank, the use of this phenomenon has been a major source of examples, as done by Mestre
[Mes92], Fermigier [Fer92, Fer97], Nagao [Nag92, Nag93, NK94], Martin-McMillen [MM98, MM00]
and ultimately Elkies [Elk06], whose record of rank ≥28overQstill holds.
We begin by considering two important results; ﬁrst by Néron [Né52, Thm. 6], which states
that the Mordell-Weil rank rt(overk) of the ﬁber π−1(t)is greater or equal to the generic rank r
for allt∈P1
koutside a thin subset of P1
k(see Deﬁnition 2.4.1); and another by Silverman [Sil83,
Thm. C], built on the ﬁrst, stating that rt≥routside a set of points of bounded height. In this
thesis we study the possibility of having rt> r, in which case we say that the rank jumps , and
study the nature of subsets of P1
kwhere rank jumps occur.
This problem has received attention not only in the case of rational elliptic surfaces [Bil98,
Sal12, LS22] but also of K3 surfaces [Sal15] and Abelian varieties [HS19]. We note that in [LS22]
the authors show that under some conditions the set of ﬁbers where the rank jumps of at least 2,
i.e.{t∈P1
k|rt≥r+ 2}is not a thin set (Deﬁnition 2.4.1), which calls attention to the nature of
the rank jump set and brings back the notion of thin sets in Néron’s specialization theorem.
Our strategy is to use Néron’s geometric methods already applied in [Shi91, Sal12, Sal15, HS19,
CT20] to produce rank jumps and use ideas from [LS22] to study the nature of the rank jump set.
More precisely, we look for conditions to guarantee that rank jumps of at least 3 occur on a non-thin
set. We show in fact that it suﬃces to require the existence of a certain genus zero ﬁbration on X,
which we call an RNRF-conic bundle (see Deﬁnitions 2.3.1 and 5.2.2). The following theorem is,
to our knowledge, the largest rank jump observed in this level of generality.
Theorem 5.0.1. IfXadmits a RNRF-conic bundle, then {t∈P1
k|rt≥r+ 3}is not thin.
Theorem 5.0.1 is proven in Chapter 5 and is also the main result in [CS].

Preliminaries
Throughout the text, all surfaces are projective and smooth over a ﬁeld k, which is either
a number ﬁeld or an algebraically closed ﬁeld of arbitrary characteristic. The ground ﬁeld kis
speciﬁed only when necessary. We reserve the letter Xto denote a geometrically rational elliptic
surface with elliptic ﬁbration π:X→P1(Deﬁnitions 2.1.1, 2.2.1). The letter Sdenotes a surface
in general, which may or may not be rational elliptic.
For the general theory of elliptic surfaces we refer the reader to the classical books by Miranda
[Mir89], Cossec and Dolgachev [CD89, Ch. V], Silverman [Sil94, Ch. III], a survey paper by Schuett
and Shioda [SS10] and the more recent book by the same authors [SS19, Ch. 5].
2.1 Elliptic surfaces
Deﬁnition2.1.1. WecallSanelliptic surface ifthereissmoothprojectivecurve Candasurjective
morphismf:S→C, called an elliptic ﬁbration , such that
i) The ﬁber f−1(t)is a smooth genus-1 curve for all but ﬁnitely many t∈C.
ii) (existence of a section) There is a morphism σ:C→Ssuch thatf◦σ=idC, called a section.
iii) (relative minimality) No ﬁber of fcontains an exceptional curve in its support (i.e., a smooth
rational curve with self-intersection −1).
Remark 2.1.2. Condition iii) can be understood as an extra hypothesis on f. For our purposes
it is a natural one, as it assures that the ﬁbers agree with Kodaira’s classiﬁcation (Theorem 2.1.8)
and that, for rational elliptic surfaces, the ﬁbration is uniquely determined by the anticanonical
system (Theorem 2.2.6).
Deﬁnition 2.1.3. Letf:S→Cbe an elliptic ﬁbration. If η∈Cis the generic point of C, we
callE:=f−1(η)thegeneric ﬁber ofπ. In particular, Eis an elliptic curve over the function ﬁeld
K:=k(C)and the set E(K)ofK-points has a group structure, which we call the Mordell-Weil
groupofS.
As the generic ﬁber is an elliptic curve over K:=k(C), the elliptic surface Smay be locally
represented in the Weierstrass form, namely
y2+a1xy+a3=x3+a2x2+a4x+a6,whereai∈Kfor alli, (2.1)
which is an aﬃne model of the generic ﬁber in A2
K.
14We also introduce a notion related to that of section.
Deﬁnition 2.1.4. A curveD⊂Sis called a multisection of degree dwhenf|D:D→Cis a ﬂat,
ﬁnite morphism of degree d. In particular, a section of f:S→Cis a multisection of degree 1.
Remark 2.1.5. In Chapter 5 we deal with multisections of degree 2, which we call bisections .
2.1.1 Correspondence between sections, curves and points on the generic ﬁber
Letf:S→Cbe an elliptic ﬁbration and Ethe generic ﬁber of f, which is an elliptic curve
over the function ﬁeld K:=k(C). We describe the natural correspondence between sections of f,
certain curves on SandK-points inE.
Given a section σ:C→S, the curveσ(C)onSis isomorphic to Cviaσ. Moreover σ(C)meets
the generic ﬁber Eat exactly one K-point, say P∈E(K).
Figure 2.1: Correspondence between sections σ:C→Sand points P∈E(K).
Conversely, a point P∈E(K)gives rise to a section in the following manner. Since Eis
the generic ﬁber, P∈E(K)corresponds to a point Pv∈f−1(v)for almost all v∈C. We take
the scheme-theoretic closure of {Pv}vinSand obtain a curve Γ⊂S. BecauseCis smooth, the
restrictionf|Γ: Γ→Cis an isomorphism, which induces a section σ:C→Ssuch that Im (σ) = Γ.
This correspondence between sections and K-points in the generic ﬁber is, in fact, bijective.
Proposition 2.1.6. [SS19, Prop. 5.4] The sections of f:S→Care in a natural bijection
correspondence with the points in E(K)viaσ/mapsto→σ(C)∩E(K), whereσ:C→Sis a section.
Remark 2.1.7. We also identify a section σ:C→Swith the image σ(C), which is a curve on S,
hence calling it a sectionas well. We note that when Sis rational, the sections correspond to the
exceptional curves of S(Theorem 2.2.6).
2.1.2 Singular Fibers
The singular ﬁbers of an elliptic ﬁbration play an important role in the study of elliptic sur-
faces. The ﬁrst classiﬁcation of singular ﬁbers was made by Kodaira [Kod63a] over the base ﬁeld C,
followed by Tate [Tat75], who introduced a simpliﬁed classifying algorithm also valid over perfect
ﬁelds. Although in Tate’s algorithm one ﬁnds the same ﬁber types as Kodaira’s, new ﬁber types
15may appear over non-perfect ﬁelds [Szy04]. As our base ﬁeld kis either a number ﬁeld or alge-
braically closed, hence perfect, we may rely on the usual classiﬁcation (Theorem 2.1.8).
Notation. We follow Kodaira’s notation [Kod63a] for ﬁber types. A smooth ﬁber is labeled as I 0,
while singular ﬁbers receive one of the following labels: I n,I∗
nfor somen≥1, II,II∗,III,III∗,IV,IV∗,
where∗indicates a nonreduced ﬁber. By Theorem 2.1.8, every reducible ﬁber (i.e. all types except
I1, II) is associated with an ADE lattice (Figure 2.2). More precisely, the intersection graph of a
reducible ﬁber forms an extended Dynkin diagram [Hum90, I.4.7] of type/tildewideAn(n≥2),/tildewideDk(k≥4)
or/tildewideE/lscript(/lscript= 6,7,8), where∼indicates that the Dynkin diagram for An,DkorE/lscriptis extended with
one extra node. In Table 2.2 the extra node corresponds to the neutral component Θ0.
Theorem 2.1.8. [Tat75, §6] Letf:S→Cbe an elliptic ﬁbration. If Fa singular ﬁber of f, then
all possibilities for Fare listed below.
Moreover, when Fis irreducible (namely of type I 1or II), it is a singular, integral curve of arith-
metic genus 1. WhenFis reducible, all members in its support are smooth, rational curves with
selﬁntersection−2.
Remark 2.1.9. Tate’s algorithm consists in identifying singular ﬁbers by analyzing local Weier-
strass forms. This local analysis can be pathological in char (k) = 2,3, but even in these cases the
possibilities for singular ﬁbers are still the ones listed in Theorem 2.1.8 [Tat75, Section 6]. In our
classiﬁcation of conic bundles in Chapter 3 we do not deal with local Weierstrass forms, but only
with the numerical behavior of ﬁbers as divisors, hence we are free to use Theorem 2.1.8 in any
characteristic.
16One way to detect singular ﬁbers is by considering a local Weierstrass form (2.1) and identifying
the zeros of the discriminant, namely [Tat75]
∆ =−b2
2b8−8b3
4−27b2
6+ 9b2b4b6,
where:
b2:=a2
1+ 4a2,
b4:=a1a3+ 2a4,
b6:=a2
3+ 4a6,
b8:=a2
1a6−a1a3a4+ 4a2a6+a2a2
3−a2
4.
Remark 2.1.10. In char (k)/negationslash= 2,3a suitable change of coordinates yields a simpler Weierstrass
form, namely y2=x3+A(t)x+B(t)for someA(t),B(t)∈k(C)whose discriminant is given by
∆(t) =−16·(4A(t)3+ 27B(t)2)[Sil94, III.1].
Tate’s algorithm for identifying ﬁber types was later reﬁned by the Dokchitser brothers [DD13],
which reduced the identiﬁcation to a simple inspection of the coeﬃcients aiof the Weierstrass form
(2.1). More precisely, given a point v∈Cand its corresponding discrete valuation v:k(C)×→Z,
the ﬁber type of f−1(v)is given by Table 2.1 [DD13, Thm. 1].

We introduce some notation for the components of the reducible ﬁbers. If Fv:=f−1(v)is a
reducible ﬁber of the elliptic ﬁbration f:S→C, we write it as:
Fv=mv−1/summationdisplay
i=0µv,iΘv,ifor eachv∈R,
where
mv:number of irreducible components of Fv.
Θv,i:irreducible components with 0≤i≤mv−1.
µv,i:multiplicity of Θv,iinFv.
m(1)
v:number of simple components ofFv,i.e. such that µv,i= 1.
R:set of reducible ﬁbers of f.
17For a ﬁxed v, we order the i-indices of the components Θv,iin the fashion of [Kod63a] as
indicated in Table 2.2 (we include the multiplicities but omit the index vfor simplicity). We warn
the reader that the i-indices in I∗
ndo not follow the usual order of the respective Dynkin diagram
for the lattice Dn+4(Figure 2.2).

182.1.3 Euler number
We introduce the formula for the Euler number (orEuler-Poincaré characteristic ) ofS, denoted
bye(S). When working over the complex numbers, this corresponds to the topological Euler
number. Over general ﬁelds, however, the Euler number is deﬁned by the alternating sum of Betti
numbers, i.e. dimensions of the /lscript-adic étale cohomology [SS19, §5.12].
For a ﬁber Fvoff:S→Cwithmvcomponents, we have
e(Fv) =

0, ifFvis smooth;
mv,ifFvis singular of type In;
mv+ 1,ifFvis singular and not of type In.
It is worth noting that, when there is no wild ramiﬁcation, the number e(Fv)coincides with the
valuationv(∆(t))of the discriminant of the Weierstrass form [SS19, §5.9]. In particular, assuming

2.1.4 Base change
WeexplaintherelationshipbetweenbasechangeonellipticsurfacesandchangesintheMordell-
Weil rank. We show how this is relevant to the study of rank jumps in Chapter 5, particularly in
the case of base changes of degree 2.
Base change and Mordell-Weil rank
In the study of an elliptic curve Eover a ﬁeld Lit is a common operation to extend the base
ﬁeld, i.e. to consider a ﬁeld extension L/prime/Land analyze the elliptic curve EoverL/prime. In this case
the set ofL/prime-points onEis at least as large as the set of L-points, which implies a possibly higher
Mordell-Weil rank over L/primethan overL.
In the case of an elliptic ﬁbration f:S→C, whose generic ﬁber Eis an elliptic curve over
the function ﬁeld K:=k(C), this construction has a geometric counterpart. Indeed, a ﬁnite ﬁeld
extensionK/prime/Kof degreedcorresponds to a ﬁnite morphism of curves ϕ:C/prime→Cof degreed,
and we obtain a commutative diagram from base change
S/primeS
C/primeCϕ/prime
f/primef
ϕ
whereS/prime:=S×CC/primeis a new elliptic surface with ﬁbration f/prime:S/prime→C/prime. Notice in particular
that the Mordell-Weil rank of f/primeis greater or equal to the Mordell-Weil rank of f, since each section
σ:C→Soffhas a natural corresponding section (σ,id) :C/prime=C×CC/prime→S×CC/prime=S/primeoff/prime.
19Base change and rank jumps
If we are able to ﬁnd a section of f/primedistinct from those of the form (σ,id) :C/prime→S/prime, then
there is a legitimate reason to ask whether f/primehas strictly higher Mordell-Weil rank than f. It
turns out that this new section does exists when C/primeis a multisection of f, i.e. a curve C/prime⊂S
such thatf|C/prime:C/prime→Cis a ﬁnite morphism. Indeed, the inclusion ι:C/prime/arrowhookleft→Sinduces a section
(ι,id) :C/prime=C×CC/prime→S/primedistinct from those of the form (σ,id).
As we now explain, the observation in the previous paragraph is crucial to our investigation to
our investigation of rank jumps (Chapter 5), i.e. of the occurrence of ﬁbers of fwhose Mordell-Weil
rank is greater than the generic rank.
Indeed, assume that the new section (ι,id)is independent from the ones of the form (σ,id)in
the Mordell-Weil group of f/prime:S/prime→C/prime. In particular r/prime> r, wherer,r/primeare the generic ranks
off,f/primerespectively. Assuming moreover that C/primehas inﬁnitely many k-points, then Silverman’s
specialization theorem [Sil83, Thm. C] guarantees that rank f/prime−1(t)≥r/primefor inﬁnitely many t∈
C/prime(k). By construction, the ﬁber f/prime−1(t)corresponds to f−1(ϕ(t)), hence rank f−1(ϕ(t))≥r/prime>r
for inﬁnitely many t∈C/prime(k). In particular, rank jumps occur at inﬁnitely many ﬁbers of f.
Conclusion: ifC/primeis a multisection of f:S→Cwhich contains inﬁnitely many k-points and
induces a new independent section of f/prime:S/prime→C/prime, then there are inﬁnitely many ﬁbers of ffor
which the rank jumps.
Quadratic base change
In Chapter 5 we address the problem of rank jumps on a rational elliptic surface π:X→P1
over a number ﬁeld k. The following result from [Sal09] tells us of the possibility of having inﬁnitely
many curves D⊂Xinducing a new independent section of the base-changed ﬁbration π/prime:X/prime→D.
Theorem 2.1.12. [Sal09] Let Lbe a pencil of curves on Xnot all contained in a ﬁber of π. Then
after base change under ϕ:=π|D:D→P1, the elliptic ﬁbration π/prime:X/prime=X×P1D→Dhas
Mordell-Weil rank strictly greater than that of πfor all but ﬁnitely many D∈L.
As mentioned earlier, in order to conclude that rank jumps occur at inﬁnitely many ﬁbers, we
still need that there be some curve in Lwith inﬁnitely many k-points. One way to obtain such L
is by ﬁnding a pencil of genus 0curves over k(aconic bundle , as in Section 2.3). By Lemma 2.3.5,
this is tantamount to ﬁnding a bisection over k, i.e. a curve D⊂Xsuch thatϕ:D→P1is ﬁnite
of degree 2, in which case we perform a quadratic base change.
Singular ﬁbers after quadratic base change
In Chapter 5, more speciﬁcally in Lemma 5.2.5, we need to describe how singular ﬁbers of
π/prime:X/prime→Drelate to those of π:X→P1in a quadratic base change. This information depends
on how the degree 2morphismϕ=π|D:D→P1ramiﬁes, as explained in what follows.
Ift∈P1is not a branch point of ϕ:D→P1, thenϕ−1(t) ={t1,t2}and the ﬁbers
π/prime−1(t1),π/prime−1(t2)are both isomorphic to π−1(t). On the other hand, if tis a branch point of
ϕ, thenϕ−1(t) ={t1}and the ﬁber type of π/prime−1(t1)is determined by the ﬁber type of π−1(t)
according to Table 2.3 below.

Example. Consider the rational elliptic surface X:y2=x3+t. By Dokchitsers’ algorithm
(Table 2.1), we identify the ﬁber types II ,II∗att= 0andt=∞respectively. Let ϕ:P1→P1
be given by (s:t)/mapsto→(s2:t2), whose branch points are t= 0andt=∞. The Weierstrass form
of the base-changed surface is obtained by pull-back under ϕ, namelyX/prime:y2=x3+t2. Again by
Dokchitsers’ algorithm, we identify types IV ,IV∗att= 0andt=∞respectively, which agrees
with Table 2.3.
2.2 Rational elliptic surfaces
Among the many examples of nontrivial elliptic surfaces, the most easy to construct, describe
andmanipulateare rationalellipticsurfaces, whichisthecentralobjectofthisthesis. Inthepresent
section we make the distinction between rational andgeometrically rational , explain how rational
elliptic surfaces can be constructed from pencils of cubics on P2and list some of their properties.
Deﬁnition 2.2.1. We say that Sis arational elliptic surface ifSis birational to P2
kand admits
an elliptic ﬁbration f:S→C.
Remark 2.2.2. SinceSis rational, Cis isomorphic to P1
kby Lüroth’s theorem.
2.2.1 Rational vs. geometrically rational surfaces
When dealing with surfaces over a non-algebraically closed ﬁeld (in our case, a number ﬁeld in
Chapter 5), we must distinguish between a rational surface and a geometrically rational surface.
Deﬁnition 2.2.3. A surfaceSoverkis calledgeometrically rational ifS×kkis birational to P2
k.
In Chapter 5 we deal with elliptic surfaces when kis a number ﬁeld, in which case the following
criterion can be used to determine whether a surface is geometrically rational.
21Lemma 2.2.4. Letf:S→Cbe a relatively minimal elliptic surface over a number ﬁeld kand
lete(S)be its Euler number. Then Sis geometrically rational if and only if e(S) = 12.
Proof.Regardless of whether Sis geometrically rational, K2
S= 0by relative minimality [Bea96,
Prop. IX.3], hence by Noether’s formula e(S) = 12χ(S). Ife(S) = 12holds, then χ(S) = 1, which
implies that Sis geometrically rational [Mir89, Lemma III.4.6]. Conversely, let Sbe geometrically
rational, i.e. S:=S×kkis birational to P2
k. Asχis a birational invariant, χ(S) = 1. From the
inclusionsHi(S,OS)⊂Hi(S,OS)fori= 1,2we conclude that χ(S) = 1, hencee(S) = 12.
2.2.2 Construction from pencils of cubics
We exhibit a standard method for constructing rational elliptic surfaces over an arbitrary ﬁeld.
We apply this in Chapter 3 to produce examples of rational elliptic surfaces.
LetLbe a ﬁeld and F,Gcubics on P2
L, at least one of them smooth. Assume moreover that
F,Gonly meet at L-rational points. The intersection F∩Ghas precisely 9points counted with
multiplicity, and the pencil of cubics P:={sF+tG= 0|(s:t)∈P1
L}hasF∩Gas its base locus.
Letφ:P2
L99KP1
Lbe the rational map associated to P. The blowup p:X→P2
Lof the 9points of
the base locus resolves the indeterminacies of φand we get an elliptic ﬁbration π:X→P1
L.
X P2
L P1
Lp
πφ
By construction, Xis birational to P2
L. Moreover, the blowup of each base point induces a
(−1)-curve onX, which is a section of π:X→P1. If we assume moreover that Lis algebraically
closed, it turns out that every rational elliptic surface can be obtained by this procedure.
Theorem 2.2.5. [CD89, Theorem 5.6.1] LetXbe a rational elliptic surface with elliptic ﬁbration
π:X→P1over an algebraically closed ﬁeld. Then Xis isomorphic to the blowup of P2at the base
locus of a pencil of cubics.
2.2.3 Properties of rational elliptic surfaces
InadditiontothepropertyinTheorem2.2.5, wementionsomeotherdistinguishedpropertiesof
rational elliptic surfaces. As these properties are geometric in nature, we assume kis algebraically
closed throughout the rest of this section.
Theorem 2.2.6. [SS10, Section 8.2] Assumekalgebraically closed and let Xbe a rational elliptic
surface with elliptic ﬁbration π:X→P1. Then
i)χ(X) = 1, whereχ(X) :=h0(X,OX)−h1(X,OX) +h2(X,OX).
ii)−KXis linearly equivalent to any ﬁber of π. In particular,−KXis nef andXadmits precisely
one elliptic ﬁbration (namely, the one deﬁned by the anticanonical system |−KX|).
iii) Every section of πis an exceptional curve (smooth, rational curve with selﬁntersection −1).
The following property is related to torsion sections of rational elliptic surfaces and plays an
important role in the study of intersection numbers in Chapter 4.
22Theorem 2.2.7. [MP89, Lemma 1.1] On a rational elliptic surface, Q1·Q2= 0for any distinct
Q1,Q2∈E(K)tor. In particular, if Ois the neutral section, then Q·O= 0for allQ∈E(K)tor\{O}.
Remark 2.2.8. Theorem 2.2.7 holds for elliptic surfaces over Ceven without assuming the surface
isrational. Overanarbitraryalgebraicallyclosedﬁeld, however, therationalityhypothesisisneeded
[SS19, Cor. 8.30].
We include two more results. Lemma 2.2.9 provides a simple test to detect ﬁbers of the elliptic
ﬁbration, whereas Lemma 2.2.10 describes the negative curves on a rational elliptic surface.
Lemma 2.2.9. Letπ:X→P1be a rational elliptic surface and Ean integral curve in X. If
E·KX= 0, thenEis a component of a ﬁber of π. If moreover E2= 0, thenEis a ﬁber.
Proof.IfP∈E, then the ﬁber F:=π−1(π(P))intersectsEatP, i.e.E∩F/negationslash=∅. On the other
hand,−KXis linearly equivalent to Fby Theorem 2.2.6, so E·F=−E·KX= 0. HenceEmust
be a component of F. Assuming moreover that E2= 0, we prove that E=F. In caseFis smooth,
this is clear. So we assume Fis singular and analyze its Kodaira type according to Theorem 2.1.8.
Notice that Fis not reducible, otherwise Ewould be a (−2)-curve, which contradicts E2= 0.
HenceFis either of type I 1or II. In both cases Fis an integral curve, therefore E=F.
Lemma 2.2.10. Letπ:X→P1be a rational elliptic surface. Every negative curve on Xis either
a(−1)-curve (section of π) or a (−2)-curve (component from a reducible ﬁber of π).
Proof.LetEbe any integral curve in XwithE2<0. By Theorem 2.2.6, −KXis nef and linearly
equivalent to any ﬁber of π. SoE·(−KX)≥0and by adjunction [Bea96, I.15] 2pa(E)−2 =
E2+E·KX<0, which only happens if pa(E) = 0. Consequently E2=−1or−2. In case
E2=−2we haveE·KX= 0, soEis ﬁber a component by Lemma 2.2.9 and this ﬁber is
reducible by Theorem 2.1.8. If E2=−1, by adjunction [Bea96, I.15] E·(−KX) = 1. But−KXis
lineary equivalent to any ﬁber, so Emeets a general ﬁber at one point, therefore Eis a section by
Proposition 2.1.6.
Remark 2.2.11. The adjunction formula in [Bea96, I.15] is proven over the complex numbers. As
the proof only relies on sheaf cohomology and Riemann-Roch [Har77, V.1.6], it can be extended to
algebraically closed ﬁelds (in fact, to arbitrary ﬁelds).
2.3 Conic bundles
We deﬁne conic bundles and explain where they appear the general theory of algebraic surfaces
and in this thesis more speciﬁcally.
Deﬁnition 2.3.1. Aconic bundle on a surface Sis a surjective morphism onto a smooth curve
ϕ:S→Cwhose general ﬁber is a smooth, irreducible curve of genus zero.
Remark 2.3.2. WhenSis rational, Cis isomorphic to P1by Lüroth’s theorem.
Remark 2.3.3. Deﬁnition 2.3.1 is essentially identical to the ones in [LS22, Deﬁnition 2.5], [GS17,
Deﬁnition 3.1]. The only diﬀerence here is that we allow the base ﬁeld kto be algebraically closed
of any characteristic.
23A prominent case where conic bundles arise is in the classiﬁcation of minimal models of L-
rational surfaces, where Lis an arbitrary ﬁeld. As shown by Iskovskikh [Isk79, Theorem 1], if Sis
anL-minimal rational surface, then Sis either (a) P2
L, (b) a quadric on P3
Lwith Pic (S)/similarequalZ, (c)
a del Pezzo surface with Pic (S) =Z/angbracketleft−KS/angbracketright, or (d) a surface with Pic (S)/similarequalZ2admitting a conic
bundle whose singular ﬁbers are isomorphic to a pair of lines meeting at a point. The latter was
named a standard conic bundle by Manin and Tsfasman [MT86, Subsection 2.2]. We remark that
the notion of standard conic bundle is often extended to higher dimension and plays a role in the
classiﬁcation of threefolds over Cin the Minimal Model Program (see, for example, [Sar80], [Isk87]
and the survey [Pro18]).
Remark 2.3.4. Deﬁnition 2.3.1 is more general than that of standard conic bundle in [MT86,
Subsection 2.2], in which every singular ﬁber is isomorphic to a pair of lines meeting at a point. In
our deﬁnition, such a singular ﬁber is of one among four possible types, namely of type A2as in
Theorem 3.2.2.
As explained in Subsection 2.1.4, the existence of a pencil of genus 0curves (i.e. a conic bundle)
on a geometrically rational elliptic surface π:X→P1is relevant to the study of rank jumps in
Chapter 5. The following result by [LS22] tells us that, over a number ﬁeld k, the presence of a
conic bundle over kis in fact equivalent the the existence of a bisection over k(Remark 2.1.5).
Lemma 2.3.5. [LS22, Lemma 2.6] Let π:X→P1be a geometrically rational elliptic surface
over a number ﬁeld k. ThenXadmits a conic bundle over kif and only if πadmits a bisection of
arithmetic genus 0overk.
2.4 Thin sets and the Hilbert property
We deﬁne thin sets and the Hilbert property following Serre [Ser08, §3.1]. We provide a brief
explaination of why these concepts are relevant and how they appear in this thesis.
Deﬁnition 2.4.1. LetVbe a variety over a ﬁeld k. A subsetT⊆V(k)is calledthinif it is a ﬁnite
union of subsets which are either contained in a proper closed subvariety of V; or in the image
f(W(k))wheref:W→Vis a generically ﬁnite dominant morphism of degree at least 2andW
is an integral variety over k.
Deﬁnition 2.4.2. A varietyVover a ﬁeld kis said to satisfy the Hilbert property if the setV(k)
is not thin.
A classical example of a variety satisfying the Hilbert property is Pn
kwhenkis a numbert ﬁeld,
as a consequence of Hilbert’s irreducibility theorem [Ser08, Thm. 3.4.1]. A still unproven conjecture
by Colliot-Thélène states that, moreover, every unirational variety over a number ﬁeld satisﬁes the
Hilbert property [Ser08, Thm. 3.5.7 and Conjecture 3.5.8]. If proven true, this is enough to give
an aﬃrmative answer to the inverse Galois problem [Ser08, Thm. 3.5.9].
In Chapter 5 we are concerned speciﬁcally with non-thin subsets of P1, which is the base of
the rational elliptic ﬁbration π:X→P1. We note that any proper Zariski-closed subset of P1
is ﬁnite and that in order to prove that an inﬁnite subset T⊂P1(k)is not thin, it suﬃces to
show that for any ﬁnite number of ﬁnite covers ϕi:Yi→P1there is a point P∈Tsuch that
P /∈ϕi(Yi)(k)⊂P1(k)for eachi.
242.5 General facts about the geometry of surfaces
We list some elementary results involving divisors, ﬁbers of morphisms S→P1and linear
systems, which are needed in the classiﬁcation of conic bundle ﬁbers in Chapter 3. We remark that
these results are valid for smooth surfaces in general, hence do not depend on the theory of elliptic
surfaces.
Lemma 2.5.1. LetDbe an eﬀective divisor on a surface Ssuch thatD·C= 0for allC∈SuppD.
ThenDis nef andD2= 0.
Proof.To see that Dis nef, just notice that D·C/prime≥0for everyC/prime/∈SuppD. To prove that D2= 0
letD=/summationtext
iniCi, where each Ciis in SuppD. ThenD2=D·(/summationtext
iniCi) =/summationtext
iniD·Ci= 0.
The most natural application of Lemma 2.5.1 is when Dis a ﬁber of a surjective morphism
S→P1. In the next lemma, we explore some properties of such morphisms needed in Chapter 3.
Lemma 2.5.2. LetFbe a ﬁber of a surjective morphism f:S→P1. Then the following hold:
a)F·C= 0for allC∈SuppF.
b) IfFis connected and Eis a divisor such that SuppE⊂SuppF, thenE2≤0. Moreover
E2= 0if and only if E=rFfor somer∈Q.
c) IfF1,...,Fnare the connected components of F, then each Fiis nef withF2
i= 0andFi·KS∈2Z.
Proof.a) Taking an arbitrary C∈SuppFand another ﬁber F/prime/negationslash=F, we haveF·C=F/prime·C= 0.
b) This is Zariski’s lemma [Pet95, Ch. 6, Lemma 6].
c) Fixi. To prove that Fiis nef andF2
i= 0we show that Fi·Ci= 0for anyCi∈SuppFithen
applyLemma2.5.1. Indeed, if j/negationslash=i, thecomponentsof Fi,Fjaredisjoint, so Fj·Ci= 0. SinceFisa
ﬁberandCi∈SuppFi⊂SuppF,thenF·Ci= 0bya). Hence Fi·Ci= (F1+...+Fn)·Ci=F·Ci= 0,
as desired. For the last part, by Riemann-Roch Fi·KS= 2(χ(S)−χ(S,Fi))∈2Z.
We end this section with a simple observation on linear systems without ﬁxed components.
Lemma 2.5.3. LetE,E/primebe eﬀective divisors such that E/prime≤Eand that the linear systems |E|,|E/prime|
have the same dimension. If |E|has no ﬁxed components, then E/prime=E.
Proof.AsE/prime≤E, we have an inclusion of vector spaces H0(S,E/prime)⊂H0(S,E). By hypothesis,
their dimensions coincide, therefore H0(S,E/prime) =H0(S,E). Hence
|E|={E+div(f)|f∈H0(S,E)}
={E/prime+div(f) + (E−E/prime)|f∈H0(S,E/prime)}
=|E/prime|+ (E−E/prime).
Assuming|E|has no ﬁxed components, we must have E−E/prime= 0.
252.6 Lattices
We stablish some basic terminology regarding lattices, which we adopt throughout the text,
and present ADE lattices, which are the most important for us when dealing with Mordell-Weil
lattices in Section 2.7.
Deﬁnition 2.6.1. Alatticeis a pair (L,/angbracketleft·,·/angbracketright), whereLis aZ-module and/angbracketleft·,·/angbracketright:L×L→Ra
non-degenerate symmetric bilinear pairing. We say that the lattice is
i)positive-deﬁnite (resp.negative-deﬁnite ) when/angbracketleftx,x/angbracketright>0(resp./angbracketleftx,x/angbracketright<0) for allx∈L\{0}.
ii) anintegerlattice when/angbracketleftx,y/angbracketright∈Zfor allx,y∈L.
iii) anevenlattice when/angbracketleftx,x/angbracketright∈2Zfor allx∈L.
Deﬁnition 2.6.2. Theduallattice of an integral latice (L,/angbracketleft·,·/angbracketright)is a sublattice of L⊗ZQgiven by
L∗:={x⊗r∈L⊗ZQ|r·/angbracketleftx,y/angbracketright∈Zfor ally∈L},
with a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear pairing naturally deﬁned by:
/angbracketleftx⊗r,x/prime⊗r/prime/angbracketright:=r·r/prime·/angbracketleftx,x/prime/angbracketrightfor allx,x/prime∈L, r,r/prime∈Q.
In particular, there is a natural embedding L/arrowhookleft→L∗viax/mapsto→x⊗1.
Deﬁnition 2.6.3. We useL−to denote the opposite lattice of (L,/angbracketleft·,·/angbracketright), i.e. the lattice deﬁned by
the same Z-moduleLwith the opposite pairing −/angbracketleft·,·/angbracketright.
Deﬁnition 2.6.4. Let(L,/angbracketleft·,·/angbracketright)be a lattice generated by α1,...,αr∈L. We deﬁne the determinant
ofLas the determinant of the Gram matrix
detL:= det(/angbracketleftαi,αj/angbracketright)i,j
Remark 2.6.5. The determinant does not depend on the choice of the generators. Indeed, if
β1,...,βrgenerateL, then the base-change matrix Uis an invertible matrix with integer coeﬃcients.
In particular, detU=±1, hence det(/angbracketleftβi,βj/angbracketright)i,j= (detU)2det(/angbracketleftαi,αj/angbracketright)i,j= det(/angbracketleftαi,αj/angbracketright)i,j.
We introduce the notion of root lattices , which is central to many apparently unrelated areas
of mathematics such as combinatorics, singular theory, Lie algebras and, in our case, Mordell-Weil
lattices.
Deﬁnition 2.6.6. A positive-deﬁnite (resp. negative-deﬁnite) integer lattice Lis called a root
latticeif it is generated by elements x∈Lsuch that/angbracketleftx,x/angbracketright= 2(resp./angbracketleftx,x/angbracketright=−2). Such
generators are called the rootsofL.
We deﬁne the fundamental root lattices, namely the ADE lattices.
Deﬁnition 2.6.7. A positive-deﬁnite root lattice Lof rankris said to be of type Ar(r≥1),Dr
(r≥4)orEr(r= 6,7,8)if it is generated by some set of roots α1,...,αrsuch that/angbracketleftαi,αj/angbracketright= 0for
everyi<jexcept in the following cases:
(Ar)/angbracketleftαi,αj/angbracketright=−1⇔i+ 1 =j.
(Dr)/angbracketleftαi,αj/angbracketright=−1⇔i+ 1 =j <r,ori=r−2, j=r.
(Er)/angbracketleftαi,αj/angbracketright=−1⇔i+ 1 =j <r,ori= 3, j=r.
26Figure 2.2: Dynkin diagrams associated with each ADE lattice.
Remark 2.6.8. ADE lattices may also be deﬁned as negative-deﬁnite, in which case all signs
should be inverted in Deﬁnition 2.6.7.
The importance of ADE lattices is explained by the following result.
Theorem 2.6.9. [Ebe13, Thm 1.2] Let Lbe a positive-deﬁnite (or negative-deﬁnite) integer lattice.
ThenLis a root lattice if and only if it is isometric to a direct sum of ADE lattices.
2.7 Mordell-Weil lattices
We introduce the Mordell-Weil lattice, which is our central tool for Chapter 4. Its notion was
ﬁrst put forward by Elkies and Shioda independently in [Elk90], [Shi90], [Shi89] and consists of a
lattice structure on the Mordell-Weil group E(K)with an explicit connection with the Néron-Severi
lattice, in a sense made precise in this seciton.
Historically, many attempts have been made, in diﬀerent contexts, to deﬁne a bilinear pairing
onE(K). This dates back to [Man64], [BSD65] and [Tat66], whose objects of interest were, re-
spectively, heights on Abelian varieties, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and the Tate
conjecture. The further step of connecting a lattice structure on E(K)with the Néron-Severi lat-
tice was made by [CZ79], whose original goal was to determine whether a given set of sections can
generateE(K). The idea of a Mordell-Weil lattice was already implicit in the latter, but a precise
deﬁnition only appears a few years later in [Elk90], [Shi90], [Shi89].
Since then, many applications have been found for Mordell-Weil lattices of both arithmetic and
geometric interest (see, for instance, [SS19, Chapter 10]). In this thesis we make a speciﬁc use of
it, namely, we take advantage of the fact that Mordell-Weil lattices have been explicitly classiﬁed
for rational elliptic surfaces [OS91] in order to obtain information about intersection numbers of
sections in Chapter 4.
27This section is dedicated to introducing the Mordell-Weil lattice, and is organized as follows.
First we make some observations about the Néron-Severi lattice NS (S)and deﬁne two sublattices,
namely the lattice T(Deﬁnition 2.7.3) and the trivial lattice (Deﬁnition 2.7.5). We proceed with
the construction of the height pairing, which leads to the deﬁnition of the Mordell-Weil lattice.
We also present the explicit formula for computing the height pairing and introduce the narrow
Mordell-Weil lattice.
We begin with a peculiar property of elliptic surfaces f:S→Cin general, namely that
numerical and algebraic equivalences coincide on S. By this feature, we may consider the Néron-
Severi group NS (S)equipped with the intersection form, called the Néron-Severi lattice .
Theorem 2.7.1. [Shi90, Thm. 3.1] On an elliptic surface S, algebraic and numerical equivalences
coincide, i.e. D1,D2∈Div(S)are equivalent in NS(S)if and only if D1·D=D2·Dfor every
D∈Div(S). Equivalently stated, NS(S)is torsion-free.
Remark 2.7.2. The fact that NS (S)is torsion-free allows us to extend scalars to Q, i.e. to deﬁne
NS(S)Q:=NS(S)⊗ZQwithout annihilating elements.
We deﬁne two important sublattices of NS (S), both of which contain information about the
reducible ﬁbers of f:S→C. We use the notation from Subsection 2.1.2.
Deﬁnition 2.7.3. For eachv∈Rwe deﬁne the lattices TvandTas
Tv:=Z/angbracketleftΘv,i|i>0/angbracketright,
T:=/circleplusdisplay
v∈RTv.
Remark 2.7.4. By Kodaira’s classiﬁcation (Theorem 2.1.8), each Tvcan be represented by a
Dynkin diagram. More precisely, the opposite lattice T−
vis isomorphic to an ADE lattice (Fig-
ure 2.2).
ThenextlatticewedeﬁneplaysanimportantroleintheconstructionoftheMordell-Weillattice.
Like the lattice T, it contains information about the reducible ﬁbers, only with the addition of the
neutral section Oand the neutral components Θv,0forv∈Rin the generator set.
Deﬁnition 2.7.5. IfO∈E(K)be the neutral section, we deﬁne the trivial lattice as
Triv(S) :=Z/angbracketleftO,Θv,i|v∈R, i≥0/angbracketright.
At this point we call the reader’s attention to the distinction between the group operations in
the Mordell-Weil group and in the Néron-Severi group. As explained in Subsection 2.1.1, sections
P1,P2∈E(K)may also be seen as curves, hence deﬁning classes P1,P2∈NS(S). However,
P1+P2/negationslash=P1+P2.
The following theorem states that, modulo the trivial lattice Triv (S), these diﬀerent operations
actually induce a group isomorphism.
Theorem 2.7.6. [Shi90, Thm 1.3] The following map is a group isomorphism:
E(K)→NS(S)/Triv(S)
P/mapsto→Pmod Triv (S)
28We proceed to deﬁne a bilinear pairing on E(K). We note that, in order to do it, we cannot
use the intersection pairing directly, which only deﬁnes a lattice on NS (S)but not on E(K). This
diﬃculty is overcome by a geometric construction which involves the orthogonal projection with
respect to Triv (S)in the Q-vectors space NS (S)Q:=NS(S)⊗ZQ.
Lemma 2.7.7. [Shi90, Lemma 8.1] There is a unique function ϕ:E(K)→NS(X)Qwith the
following properties:
(i)ϕ(P)≡Pmod Triv (S)Qfor allP∈E(K).
(ii)ϕ(P)⊥Triv(S)for allP∈E(K).
Moreover, the class ϕ(P)∈NS(S)Qis represented by the following Q-divisor:
DP:=P−O−(P·O+χ(S))F+/summationdisplay
v∈R(Θv,1,...,Θv,mv−1)(−A−1

P·Θv,1
...
P·Θv,mv−1
,
whereFis a ﬁber of πandAvis the matrix (Θv,i·Θv,j)1≤i,j≤mv−1.
In fact, the map ϕis a group morphism and induces an embedding E(K)/E(K)tor/arrowhookleft→NS(S)Q.
Lemma 2.7.8. [Shi90, Lemma 8.2] The mapϕ:E(K)→NS(X)Qis a group homomorphism.
Moreover, kerϕ=E(K)tor, henceϕinduces an injective morphism E(K)/E(K)tor/arrowhookleft→NS(S).
We are ready to deﬁne a bilinear pairing on E(K), which we call the height pairing .
Theorem 2.7.9. [Shi90, Thm 6.20] We deﬁne the height pairing as
/angbracketleft·,·/angbracketright:E(K)×E(K)→Q
P,Q/mapsto→−ϕ(P)·ϕ(Q),
which induces a positive-deﬁnite pairing on E(K)/E(K)tor. The lattice (E(K)/E(K)tor,/angbracketleft·,·/angbracketright)is
called the Mordell-Weil lattice.
Once the height pairing is constructed, we also deﬁne the heightof a section and the minimal
normof the Mordell-Weil lattice.
Deﬁnition 2.7.10. Theheightof a section and the minimal norm ofE(K)are deﬁned as
h(P) :=/angbracketleftP,P/angbracketrightfor eachP∈E(K),
µ:= min{h(P)>0|P∈E(K)}.
A convenient feature of the height pairing is that it can be computed explicitly. Before we
introduce the explicit formula, we deﬁne one of the terms it involves, namely the local contribution .
Deﬁnition 2.7.11. Letv∈RandP,Q∈E(K). IfP,Qmeet the ﬁber FvatΘv,i,Θv,jrespectively,
we deﬁne the local contribution as
contrv(P,Q) :=/braceleftBigg
(−A−1
v)i,jifi,j≥1,
0 otherwise.
contrv(P) :=contrv(P,P).
where (−A−1
v)i,jis the (i,j)-entry of the matrix −A−1
vin Lemma 2.7.7.
The explicit values for the local contributions are in Table 2.4 [SS19, Table 6.1].

We are ready to present the explicit formula for the height pairing, called the height formula .
Theorem 2.7.12. [Shi90, Thm. 8.6] LetP,Q∈E(K)andO∈E(K)the neutral section. Then
/angbracketleftP,Q/angbracketright=χ(S) +P·O+Q·O−P·Q−/summationdisplay

Remark 2.7.13. In this thesis we focus on rational elliptic surfaces, in which case χ(S) = 1in
equations 2.2 and 2.3 by Theorem 2.2.6.
An important sublattice of E(K)is thenarrow Mordell-Weil lattice E(K)0, deﬁned as
E(K)0:={P∈E(K)|Pintersects Θv,0for allv∈R}
={P∈E(K)|contrv(P) = 0for allv∈R}.
As a subgroup, E(K)0is torsion-free; as a sublattice, it is a positive-deﬁnite even integral lattice
with ﬁnite index in E(K)[SS19, Thm. 6.44]. The importance of the narrow lattice can be explained
by its considerable size as a sublattice and by the easiness to compute the height pairing on it,
since all contribution terms vanish. A complete classiﬁcation of the lattices E(K)andE(K)0on
rational elliptic surfaces is found in [OS91, Main Thm.].
302.8 Bounds cmax, cminfor the contribution term
We deﬁne the bounds cmax,cminfor the contribution term/summationtext
vcontrv(P)and state some simple
facts about them in the case of rational elliptic surfaces. We also provide an example to illustrate
how they are computed.
In our investigation of intersection numbers in Chapter 4, the need for these bounds arise
naturally. Indeed, suppose we are given a section P∈E(K)whose height h(P)is known and
we want to determine P·O. In caseP∈E(K)0we have a direct answer, namely P·O=
h(P)/2−1by the height formula (2.3). However, if P /∈E(K)0the computation of P·Odepends
on the contribution term cP:=/summationtext
vcontrv(P), which by Table 2.4 depends on how Pintersects the
reducible ﬁbers of π. Usually we do not have this intersection data at hand, hence an estimate for
cPbecomes imperative.
Deﬁnition 2.8.1. AssumingR/negationslash=∅, we deﬁne
cmax:=/summationdisplay
v∈Rmax{contrv(P)|P∈E(K)},
cmin:= min{contrv(P)>0|P∈E(K),v∈R}.
Remark 2.8.2. In a rational elliptic surface, R=∅only occurs when the Mordell-Weil rank is
r= 8(No. 1 in Table 6.1). In this case E(K)0=E(K)and/summationtext
vcontrv(P) = 0∀P∈E(K), hence
we adopt the convention cmax=cmin= 0.
Remark 2.8.3. We usecmax,cminas bounds for cP:=/summationtext
vcontrv(P). For our purposes it is not
necessary to know whether cPactually attains one of these bounds for some P, thereforecmax,cmin
should be understood as hypothetical values.
We state some facts about cmax,cmin.
Lemma 2.8.4. LetXbe a rational elliptic surface with Mordell-Weil rank r≥1. Then
i)cmin>0ifR/negationslash=∅.
ii)cmax<4.
iii)cmin≤/summationtext
v∈Rcontrv(P)≤cmax∀P /∈E(K)0. ForP∈E(K)0, only the second inequality holds.
iv) If/summationtext
v∈Rcontrv(P) =cmin, thencontrv/prime(P) =cminfor somev/primeandcontrv(P) = 0forv/negationslash=v/prime.
Proof.Item i) is immediate from the deﬁnition of cmin. For ii) it is enough to check the values of
cmaxdirectly in Table 6.1. For iii), the second inequality follows from the deﬁnition of cmaxand
clearly holds for any P∈E(K). IfP /∈E(K)0, thencP:=/summationtext
vcontrv(P)>0, so contr v0(P)>0
for somev0. Therefore cP≥contrv0(P)≥cmin.
At last, we prove iv). If R=∅, thencmin= 0and the claim is trivial. Hence let R/negationslash=∅and/summationtext
vcontrv(P) =cmin. Assume by contradiction that there are v1/negationslash=v2such that contr vi(P)>0for
i= 1,2. By deﬁnition of cmin, we havecmin≤contrvi(P)fori= 1,2, thus
cmin=/summationdisplay
vcontrv(P)≥contrv1(P) +contrv2(P)≥2cmin,
which is absurd because cmin>0by i). Hence there is only one v/primewith contr v/prime(P)>0, while
contrv(P) = 0for allv/negationslash=v/prime. In particular, contr v/prime(P) =cmin.
31Explicit computation. Once we know the lattice Tassociated with the reducible ﬁbers of π, the
computation of cmax,cminis simple. For a ﬁxed v∈R, the extreme values for the local contribution
contrv(P)are given in Table 2.5, which is derived from Table 2.4. We provide an example to
illustrate this computation.

2.9 The diﬀerence ∆ =cmax−cmin
We explain why the value of ∆ :=cmax−cminis relevant to the investigation in Chapter 4,
specially in Section 4.4. For rational elliptic surfaces, we verify that ∆<2in most cases and
identify the exceptional ones in Table 2.6 and Table 2.7.
As noted in Section 2.8, in case P /∈E(K)0andh(P)is known, the diﬃculty of determining
P·Olies in the contribution term cP:=/summationtext
vcontrv(P). In particular, the range of possible values
forcPdetermines the possibilities for P·O. This range is measured by the diﬀerence
∆ :=cmax−cmin.
Hence a smaller ∆means a better control over the intersection number P·O, which is why ∆
plays an important role in determining possible intersection numbers. In Section 4.5 we assume
∆≤2and state necessary and suﬃcient conditions for having a pair P1,P2such thatP1·P2=k
for a given k≥0. If however ∆>2, the existence of such a pair is not guaranteed a priori, so a
case-by-case treatment is needed. Fortunately by Lemma 2.9.1 the case ∆>2is rare.
32Lemma 2.9.1. LetXbe a rational elliptic surface with Mordell-Weil rank r≥1. The only cases
with ∆ = 2and∆>2are in Table 2.6 and 2.7 respectively. In particular we have ∆<2whenever
E(K)is torsion-free.

Table 2.7: Cases with ∆>2
Proof.By searching Table 6.1 for all cases with ∆ = 2and∆>2, we obtain Table 2.6 and Table 2.7
respectively. Notice in particular that in both tables the torsion part of E(K)is always nontrivial.
Consequently, if E(K)is torsion-free, then ∆<2.
2.10 The quadratic form QX
We deﬁne the positive-deﬁnite quadratic form with integer coeﬃcients QXderived from the
height pairing. The relevance of QXis due to the fact that some conditions for having P1·P2=k
for someP1,P2∈E(K)can be stated in terms of what integers can be represented by QX(see
Corollary 4.3.2 and Proposition 4.6.1).
33We deﬁneQXsimply by clearing denominators of the rational quadratic form induced by the
height pairing; the only question is how to ﬁnd a scale factor that works in every case. More
precisely, if E(K)has rankr≥1andP1,...,Prare generators of its free part, then q(x1,...,xr) :=
h(x1P1+...+xrPr)is a quadratic form with coeﬃcients in Q; we deﬁne QXby multiplying qby
some integer d>0so as to produce coeﬃcients in Z. We show that dmay always be chosen as the
determinant of the narrow lattice E(K)0.
Deﬁnition 2.10.1. LetXwithr≥1. LetP1,...,Prbe generators of the free part of E(K). Deﬁne
QX(x1,...,xr) := (detE(K)0)·h(x1P1+...+xrPr).
We check that the matrix representing QXhas entries in Z, thereforeQXhas coeﬃcients in Z.
Lemma 2.10.2. LetAbe the matrix representing the quadratic form QX, i.e.Q(x1,...,xr) =xtAx,
wherex:= (x1,...,xr)t. ThenAhas integer entries. In particular, QXhas integer coeﬃcients.
Proof.LetP1,...,Prbe generators of the free part of E(K)and letL:=E(K)0. The free part of
E(K)is isomorphic to the dual lattice L∗[OS91, Main Thm.], so we may ﬁnd generators P0
1,...,P0
r
ofLsuch that the Gram matrix B0:= (/angbracketleftP0
i,P0
j/angbracketright)i,jofLis the inverse of the Gram matrix
B:= (/angbracketleftPi,Pj/angbracketright)i,jofL∗.
We claim that QXis represented by the adjugate matrix of B0, i.e. the matrix adj (B0)such
thatB0·adj(B0) = (detB0)·Ir, whereIris ther×ridentity matrix. Indeed, by construction B
represents the quadratic form h(x1P1+...+xrPr), therefore
QX(x1,...,xr) = (detE(K)0)·h(x1P1+...+xrPr)
= (detB0)·xtBx
= (detB0)·xt(B0)−1x
=xtadj(B0)x,
as claimed. To prove that A:=adj(B0)has integer coeﬃcients, notice that the Gram matrix
B0ofL=E(K)0has integer coeﬃcients (as E(K)0is an even lattice), then so does A.
We close this section with a simple consequence of the deﬁnition of QX.
Lemma 2.10.3. Ifh(P) =mfor someP∈E(K), thenQXrepresentsd·m, whered:= detE(K)0.
Proof.LetP1,...,Prbe generators for the free part of E(K). LetP=a1P1+...+arPr+Q, where
ai∈ZandQis a torsion element (possibly zero). Since torsion sections do not contribute to the
height pairing, then h(P−Q) =h(P) =m. Hence
QX(a1,...,ar) =d·h(a1P1+...+arPr)
=d·h(P−Q)
=d·m.
34Chapter 3
Conic bundles on rational elliptic
surfaces
In Section 2.3 we explain how conic bundles appear in the general theory of algebraic surfaces.
In this chapter we focus on conic bundles on a rational elliptic surface, which is motivated by results
and techniques from [Sal12], [LS22], [GS17], [GS20] and [AGL16]. In [Sal12], [LS22] the existence
of conic bundles on Xis used as a central condition for having rank jumps, in a sense made precise
in Subsection 2.1.4 and specially in Chapter 5. The relevance of conic bundles in [GS17], [GS20]
and [AGL16] is due to other reasons, which we now brieﬂy explain.
Over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero, the existence of conic bundles on Xis
used in [GS17], [GS20] in order to classify elliptic ﬁbrations on K3 surfaces that are quadratic covers
ofX. More precisely, given a degree two morphism f:P1→P1ramiﬁed away from nonreduced
ﬁbers ofπ, the induced K3 surface is X/prime:=X×fP1. The base change also gives rise to an elliptic
ﬁbrationπ/prime:X/prime→P1and a degree two map f/prime:X/prime→X. By composition with f/prime, every conic
bundle onXinduces a genus 1ﬁbration on X/prime, in which case we may obtain elliptic ﬁbrations
distinct from π.
In [AGL16] conic bundles are also useful, although in a very diﬀerent context. In this case
the base ﬁeld is Cand the goal is to ﬁnd generators for the Cox ring R(X) :=/circleplustext
[D]H0(X,D ),
where [D]runs through Pic (X). Given a rational elliptic ﬁbration π:X→P1, the ringR(X)
is ﬁnitely generated if and only if Xis a Mori Dream Space [HK00, Proposition 2.9], which in
turn is equivalent to πhaving generic rank zero [AL09, Corollary 5.4]. Assuming this is the case,
the authors show that in many conﬁgurations of πeach minimal set of generators of R(X)must
contain an element g∈H0(X,D ), whereDis a ﬁber of a conic bundle on X, whose possibilities
are explicitly described.

this chapter. Here we consider a rational elliptic surface π:X→P1over an arbitrary algebraically
closed ﬁeld and proceed by the following plan. In Section 3.1 we characterize conic bundles in terms
of certain Néron-Severi classes and deduce some geometric properties using this point of view. By
applying these results in Section 3.2, we completely describe the possible types of conic bundle
ﬁbers. Section 3.3 is dedicated to the study of how the ﬁber conﬁguration of πinterferes with the
possible ﬁber conﬁguration of conic bundles on X. Finally in Section 3.4 we present a method to
construct conic bundles and produce some examples to illustrate our results.
353.1 Numerical characterization of conic bundles
We give a characterization of conic bundles on a rational elliptic surface Xfrom a numerical
standpoint. The motivation for this approach comes from the following. Let ϕ:X→P1be a conic
bundle and let Cbe a general ﬁber of ϕ, hence a smooth, irreducible curve of genus zero. Clearly C
is a nef divisor with C2= 0and, by adjunction, C·(−KX) = 2. These three numerical properties
are enough to prove that |C|is a base point free pencil and consequently the induced morphism
ϕ|C|:X→P1givesϕitself.
Conversely, let Dbe a nef divisor with D2= 0andD·(−KX) = 2. Since numerical and
algebraic equivalence coincide by Theorem 2.7.1, it makes sense to consider the class [D]∈NS(X).
The natural question is whether [D]induces a conic bundle on X. The answer is yes, moreover
there is a natural correspondence between such classes and conic bundles (Theorem 3.1.9), which
is the central result of this section.
In order to prove this correspondence we need a numerical analysis of a given class [D]∈NS(X)
so that we can deduce geometric properties of the induced morphism ϕ|D|:X→P1, such as
connectivity of ﬁbers (Proposition 3.1.6) and composition of their support (Proposition 3.1.4).
These properties are also crucial to the classiﬁcation of ﬁbers in Section 3.2.
Deﬁnition 3.1.1. A class [D]∈NS(X)is called a conic class when
i)Dis nef.
ii)D2= 0.
iii)D·(−KX) = 2.
Lemma 3.1.2. Let[D]∈NS(X)be a conic class. Then |D|is a base point free pencil and therefore
induces a surjective morphism ϕ|D|:X→P1.
Proof.By [Har95, Theorem III.1(a)], |D|is base point free and h1(X,D ) = 0. We haveχ(X) = 1
by Theorem 2.2.6, and Riemann-Roch gives h0(X,D ) +h2(X,D ) = 2, so we only need to prove
h2(X,D ) = 0. Assume by contradiction that h2(X,D )≥1. By Serre duality h0(KX−D)≥1,
soKX−Dis linearly equivalent to an eﬀective divisor. Since Dis nef, (KX−D)·D≥0, which
contradicts D2= 0andD·(−KX) = 2.
Remark 3.1.3. It follows from Lemma 3.1.2 that a conic class has an eﬀective representative.
Notice that we do not know a priori that the morphism ϕ|D|:X→P1in Lemma 3.1.2 is a
conic bundle. At this point we can only say that if Cis a smooth, irreducible ﬁber of ϕ|D|, then
g(C) = 0by adjunction. However it is still not clear whether a general ﬁber of ϕ|D|is irreducible
and smooth. We prove that this is the case in Proposition 3.1.7. In order to do that we need
information about the components of Dfrom Proposition 3.1.4 and the fact that Dis connected
from Proposition 3.1.6.
36Proposition 3.1.4. Let[D]∈NS(X)be a conic class. If Dis an eﬀective representative, then
every curve E∈SuppDis a smooth rational curve with E2≤0.
Proof.Takeanarbitrary E∈SuppD. ByLemma3.1.2, Disaﬁberofthemorphism ϕ|D|:X→P1
induced by|D|, henceD·E= 0by Lemma 2.5.2. Assuming E2>0by contradiction, the fact that
D2= 0implies that Dis numerically equivalent to zero by the Hodge index theorem [Har77, Thm.
V.1.9, Rmk. 1.9.1]. This is absurd because D·(−KX) = 2/negationslash= 0, so indeed E2≤0.
Toshowthat Eisasmoothrationalcurve, itsuﬃcestoprovethat pa(E) = 0. ByTheorem2.2.6,
−KXislinearlyequivalenttoanyﬁberof π, inparticular−KXisnefandE·KX≤0. Byadjunction
[Bea96, I.15] 2pa(E)−2 =E2+E·KX≤0, sopa(E)≤1. Assume by contradition that pa(E) = 1.
This can only happen if E2=E·KX= 0, soEis a ﬁber of πby Lemma 2.2.9. In this case Eis
linearly equivalent to −KX, soD·E=D·(−KX) = 2, which contradicts D·E= 0.
Remark 3.1.5.
While Proposition 3.1.4 provides information about the support of D, the next proposition
states that Dis connected, which is an important fact about the composition of Das a whole.
Proposition 3.1.6. Let[D]∈NS(X)be a conic class. If Dis an eﬀective representative, then D
is connected.
Proof.LetD=D1+...+Dn, whereD1,...,Dnare connected components. By Lemma 2.5.2 c) each
Diis nef with D2
i= 0andDi·KX∈2Z. Since−KXis nef by Theorem 2.2.6 and D·(−KX) = 2,
thenDi0·(−KX) = 2for somei0andDi·(−KX) = 0fori/negationslash=i0. In particular [Di0]∈NS(X)is a
conic class. By Lemma 2.5.3, both |D|and|Di0|are pencils, so D=Di0by Lemma 2.5.3.
We use Propositions 3.1.4 and 3.1.6 to conclude that ϕ|D|:X→P1is indeed a conic bundle.
Proposition 3.1.7. Let[D]∈NS(X)be a conic class. Then all ﬁbers of ϕ|D|:X→P1are
smooth, irreducible curves of genus 0except for ﬁnitely many which are reducible and supported on
negative curves. In particular, ϕ|D|is a conic bundle.
Proof.LetFa ﬁber ofϕ|D|. SinceFis linearly equivalent to D, then [F] = [D]∈NS(X), soFis
connected by Proposition 3.1.6. By Proposition 3.1.4 every E∈SuppFhasg(E) = 0andE2≤0.
First assume E2= 0for someE∈SuppF. SinceFis a connected ﬁber of ϕ|D|, thenE=rF
for somer∈Qby Lemma 2.5.2. Because F·(−KX) = 2, we haveE·KX=−2r. By adjunction
[Bea96, I.15], r= 1, soF=Eis a smooth, irreducible curve of genus 0.
Now assume E2<0for everyE∈SuppF. ThenFmust be reducible, otherwise F2=E2<0,
which is absurd since Fis a ﬁber of ϕ|D|. Conversely, if Fis reducible, then E2<0for all
E∈SuppF, otherwise E2= 0for someEand by the last paragraph Fis irreducible, which is a
contradiction.
This shows that either Fis smooth, irreducible of genus 0orFis reducible, in which case Fis
supported on negative curves. We are left to show that ϕ|D|has ﬁnitely many reducible ﬁbers.
Assume by contradiction that there is an inﬁnite set {Fn}n∈Nof reducible ﬁbers of ϕ|D|. In
particular each Fnis supported on negative curves, which are either (−1)-curves (sections of π) or
(−2)-curves (components of reducible ﬁbers) by Lemma 2.2.10.
37Sinceπhas ﬁnitely many singular ﬁbers, the number of (−2)-curves inXis ﬁnite, so there are
ﬁnitely many Fnwith (−2)-curves in its support. Excluding such Fn, we may assume all members
in{Fn}n∈Nare supported on (−1)-curves. For each n, takePn∈SuppFn. The ﬁbers Fn,Fm
are disjoint, so Pn,Pmare disjoint when n/negationslash=m. By contracting ﬁnitely many exceptional curves
P1,...,P/lscript, we are still left with an inﬁnite set {Pm}m>/lscriptof exceptional curves, so we cannot reach a
minimal model for X, which is absurd.
Remark 3.1.8. In characteristic zero the proof of Proposition 3.1.7 can be made simpler by
applying Bertini’s theorem [Har77, Cor. 10.9], which guarantees that all but ﬁnitely many ﬁbers
are smooth from the fact that Xis smooth.
We now prove the numerical characterization of conic bundles.
Theorem 3.1.9. LetXbe a rational elliptic surface. If [D]∈NS(X)is a conic class, then |D|is a
base point free pencil whose induced morphism ϕ|D|:X→P1is a conic bundle. Moreover, the map
[D]/mapsto→ϕ|D|has an inverse ϕ/mapsto→[F], whereFis any ﬁber of ϕ. This gives a natural correspondence
between conic classes and conic bundles.
Proof.Given a conic class [D]∈NS(X), by Proposition 3.1.7 the general ﬁber of ϕ|D|:X→P1is
a smooth, irreducible curve of genus 0, soϕ|D|is a conic bundle.
Conversely, if ϕ:X→P1is a conic bundle and Cis a smooth, irreducible ﬁber of ϕ, in
particularC2= 0,g(C) = 0and by adjunction [Bea96, I.15] C·(−KX) = 2. ClearlyCis nef, so
[C]∈NS(X)is a conic class. Moreover, any other ﬁber Fofϕis linearly equivalent to C, therefore
[F] = [C]∈NS(X)and the map ϕ/mapsto→[F]is well deﬁned.
We verify that the maps are mutually inverse. Given a class [D]we may assume Dis eﬀective
since|D|is a pencil, so Dis a ﬁber of ϕ|D|, henceϕ|D|/mapsto→[D]. Conversely, given a conic bundle ϕ
with a ﬁber F, thenϕ|F|coincides with ϕtautologically, so [F]/mapsto→ϕ.
3.2 Classiﬁcation of conic bundle ﬁbers
We prove one of the main results the chapter, which is the complete description of ﬁbers of a
conic bundle on X. We start with a description of ﬁber components in Lemma 3.2.1, deﬁne some
terminology related to intersection graphs and proceed with the proof of Theorem 3.2.2.
Lemma 3.2.1. Letϕ:X→P1be a conic bundle and Dany ﬁber of ϕ. ThenDis connected and
(i)Dis either a smooth, irreducible curve of genus 0, or
(ii)D=P1+P2+D/prime, whereP1,P2are(−1)-curves (sections of π), not necessarily distinct, and
D/primeis either zero or supported on (−2)-curves (components of reducible ﬁbers of π).
Proof.By Proposition 3.1.7, all ﬁbers of ϕfall into category (i) except for ﬁnitely many that are
reducible and supported on negative curves. Let Dbe one of such ﬁnitely many.
From Lemma 2.2.10, Supp Dcontains only (−1)-curves (sections of π) or(−2)-curves (compo-
nents of reducible ﬁbers of π). By adjunction [Bea96, I.15], if C∈SuppDis a(−2)-curve, then
C·(−KX) = 0, and ifP∈SuppDis a(−1)-curve, then P·(−KX) = 1. ButD·(−KX) = 2, hence
Dmust have a term P1+P2whereP1,P2are possibly equal (−1)-curves; and a possibly zero term
D/primecontaining (−2)-curves, as desired.
At this point we have enough information about the curves that support a conic bundle ﬁber.
It remains to investigate their multiplicities and how they intersect one another.
38Theorem 3.2.2. LetXbe a rational elliptic surface with elliptic ﬁbration π:X→P1and let
ϕ:X→P1be a conic bundle. If Dis a ﬁber of ϕ, then the intersection graph of Dﬁts one of the
types below. Conversely, if the intersection graph of a divisor Dﬁts any of these types, then |D|
induces a conic bundle ϕ|D|:X→P1.

Terminology. Before we prove Theorem 3.2.2, we introduce a natural terminology for dealing
with the intersection graph of D. WhenC,C/prime∈SuppDare distinct, we say that C/primeis aneighbour
ofCwhenC·C/prime>0. IfChas exactly one neighbour, we call Canextremity . We denote the
number of neighbours of Cbyn(C). A simple consequence of these deﬁnitions is the following.

39Proof of Theorem 3.2.2. We begin by the converse. If Dﬁts one of the types, we must prove
[D]∈NS(X)is a conic class, so that ϕ|D|:X→P1is a conic bundle by Theorem 3.1.9. A
case-by-case veriﬁcation gives D·C= 0for allC∈SuppD. SinceDis eﬀective, it is nef with
D2= 0by Lemma 2.5.1. The condition D·(−KX) = 2is satisﬁed in type 0by adjunction. We have
D·(−KX) = 2in typesA2,Anfor they contain two distinct sections of πand also in types D3,Dm
for they contain a section with multiplicity 2. Hence [D]∈NS(X)is a conic class, as desired.
Now letDbe a ﬁber of ϕ. By Lemma 3.2.1, Dis connected and has two possible forms. If
Dis irreducible, we get type 0. Otherwise D=P1+P2+D/prime, whereP1,P2are(−1)-curves and
D/primeis either zero or supported on (−2)-curves. IfD/prime=/summationtext
iniCithenn(Ci)≤2niby Lemma 3.2.3.
The bounds for n(P1),n(P2)depend on whether i) P1/negationslash=P2or ii)P1=P2. In what follows we use
Lemma 2.5.2 a) implicitly several times.
i)P1/negationslash=P2. In this case n(P1)≤1andn(P2)≤1. SinceDis connected, both P1,P2must have
some neighbour, so n(P1) =n(P2) = 1, therefore P1,P2are extremities. If the extremities P1,P2
meet, they form the whole graph, so D=P1+P2. This is type A2.
IfP1,P2do not meet, by connectedness there must be a path on the intersection graph join-
ing them, say P1,C1,...,Ck,P2. SinceP1is an extremity, it has only C1as a neighbour, so
0 =D·P1=−1 +n1givesn1= 1. Moreover n(C1)≤2and by the position of C1in the
path we have n(C1) = 2. We prove by induction that ni= 1andn(Ci) = 2for alli= 1,...,k.
Assume this is true for i= 1,...,/lscript < k . Then 0 =D·C/lscript= 1−2 +n/lscript+1, son/lscript+1= 1. Moreover,
n(C/lscript+1)≤2and by the position of C/lscript+1in the path we have n(C/lscript+1) = 2. So the graph is precisely
the chainP1,C1,...,Ck,P2. This is type An(n≥3).
ii)P1=P2. In this case n(P1)≤2. We cannot have n(P1) = 0, otherwise D2= (2P1)2=−4,
son(P1) = 1or2. IfP1has two neighbours, say C1,C2, then 0 =D·P1=−2 +n1+n2, which
only happens if n1=n2= 1. Moreover, n(C1)≤2, soC1can possibly have another neighbour
C3in addition to P1. But then D·P1= 0givesn3= 0, which is absurd, so C1has onlyP1as a
neighbour. By symmetry C2also has only P1as a neighbour. This is type D3.
Finally letn(P1) = 1andC1be the only neighbour of P1. ThenCi·P1= 0wheni>1. Notice
thatC1,Cicome from the same ﬁber of π, sayF, otherwise Ciwould be in a diﬀerent connected
component as C1,P1, which contradicts Dbeing connected. The possible Dynkin diagrams for F
are listed in Theorem 2.1.8. Since P1intersectsFin a simple component, the possibilities are
(a) (b) (c)
2•n0•n1•nm2•n0•n1•nmbranch 1
branch 22•n0•n1
•n2
•n3•nm
In (a), (b) and (c), D·P1= 0impliesn1= 2. In (c),D·C1= 0givesn2+nm= 2, hence
n2=nm= 1. ButD·C2= 0givesn3= 0, which is absurd, so (c) is ruled out. For (a), (b) we
proceed by induction: if k <mandn1=...=nk= 2, thenD·Ck= 0givesnk+1= 2, therefore
n1=...=nm= 2. But in (a), D·Cm= 0impliesnm= 1, which is absurd, so (a) is also ruled out.
In (b), letCm+1,Cm+2be the ﬁrst elements in branches 1and2respectively. Then D·Cm= 0
givesnm+1=nm+2= 1. Consequently n(Cm+1)≤2andn(Cm+2)≤2. IfCm+1has another
neighbourCm+3in addition to Cm, thenD·Cm+1= 0impliesnm+3= 0, which is absurd, so Cm+1
is an extremity. By symmetry, Cm+2is also an extremity. This is type Dm(m≥4).
403.3 Fibers of conic bundles vs. ﬁbers of the elliptic ﬁbration
LetXbe a rational elliptic surface with elliptic ﬁbration π:X→P1. The existence of a conic
bundleϕ:X→P1with a given ﬁber type is strongly dependent on the ﬁber conﬁguration of π.
This relationship is explored in Theorem 3.3.2, which provides simple criteria to identify when a
certain ﬁber type is possible. Before we prove it, we need the following result about the existence
of disjoint sections.
Lemma 3.3.1. IfXis a rational elliptic surface with nontrivial Mordell-Weil group, then there
exists a pair of disjoint sections.
Proof.LetE(K)be the Mordell-Weil group of π, whose neutral section we denote by O. By
[OS91, Thm. 2.5], E(K)is generated by sections which are disjoint from O. Hence there must be
a generator P/negationslash=Odisjoint from O, otherwise E(K) ={O}, which contradicts the hypothesis.
We now state and prove the main result of this section.
Theorem 3.3.2. LetXbe a rational elliptic surface with elliptic ﬁbration π:X→P1. Then the
following statements hold:
a)Xadmits a conic bundle with an A2ﬁber⇔πhas positive generic rank and no III∗ﬁber.
b)Xadmits a conic bundle with an An≥3ﬁber⇔πhas a reducible ﬁber distinct from II∗.
c)Xadmits a conic bundle with a D3ﬁber⇔πhas at least two reducible ﬁbers.
d)Xadmits a conic bundle with a Dm≥4ﬁber⇔πhas a nonreduced ﬁber or a ﬁber In≥4.
Proof.a)WeleavetheproofofthisitemtoChapter4, sincetheclaimisequivalenttoTheorem4.7.8
in Section 4.7.4.
b) Assume Xadmits a conic bundle with an An≥3ﬁber. Since type Ancontains a (−2)-curve,
by Lemma 2.2.10, πhas a reducible ﬁber F. We claim that F/negationslash=II∗, which is equivalent to saying
that the lattice T(see Deﬁnition 2.7.3) is not E8. Indeed, if this were so, then Mordell-Weil group
E(K)would be trivial [OS91, Main Thm.], which is impossible, since the Anﬁber of the conic
bundle contains two distinct sections. Conversely, assume πhas a reducible ﬁber F/negationslash=II∗. Then
E(K)is not trivial [OS91, Main Thm.] and by Lemma 3.3.1 we may ﬁnd two disjoint sections
P,P/prime. LetC,C/prime∈SuppFbe the components hit by P,P/prime. SinceFis connected, there is a path
C,C 1,...,C/lscript,C/primein the intersection graph of F. LetD:=P+C+C1+...+C/lscript+C/prime+P/prime. By
Theorem 3.2.2, ϕ|D|:X→P1is a conic bundle and Dis anAnﬁber of it.
41c) Assume Xadmits a conic bundle with a D3ﬁberD=C1+ 2P+C2, whereC1,C2are
(−2)-curves and Pis a section with C1·P=C2·P= 1. SincePhits each ﬁber of πat exactly
one point, then C1,C2must come from two distinct reducible ﬁbers of π. Conversely, let F1,F2be
two reducible ﬁbers of π. IfPis a section, then PhitsFiat some (−2)-curveCi∈SuppFi. Let
D:=C1+ 2P+C2. By Theorem 3.2.2, ϕ|D|:X→P1is a conic bundle and Dis aD3ﬁber of it.
d) Assume Xadmits a conic bundle with a DmﬁberD= 2P+ 2C1+...+ 2C/lscript+ (C/lscript+1+C/lscript+2),
where allCi’s come from a reducible ﬁber Fofπ. Notice that if /lscript > 1thenC/lscriptmeets three
(−2)-curves, namely C/lscript−1,C/lscript+1,C/lscript+2(see picture below). Going through the list in Theorem 2.1.8,
we see that this intersection behavior only happens if Fis I∗
n, II∗, III∗or IV∗, all of which are
nonreduced. If /lscript= 1, thenC1meets the section Pand two (−2)-curves which do not intersect,
namelyC2,C3. Again by examining the list in Theorem 2.1.8, Fmust be I nwithn≥4. Conversely,
letFbe nonreduced or of type I nwithn≥4. Take a section Pthat hitsFatC1. Now take a
chainC2,...,C/lscriptso thatC/lscriptmeets two other components of F. We name these two C/lscript+1,C/lscript+2and
deﬁneD:= 2P+ 2C1+...+ 2C/lscript+ (C/lscript+1+C/lscript+2). By Theorem 3.2.2, ϕ|D|:X→P1is a conic
bundle and Dis a typeDmﬁber of it.
423.4 Examples of conic bundles
We present examples of conic bundles over rational elliptic surfaces to illustrate how the ﬁber
types in Theorem 3.2.2 may appear. For simplicity, in this section we work over k=C, although
similar constructions are possible over diﬀerent ﬁelds. In Subsection 3.4.1 we describe how the
examplesareconstructedandstablishsomenotation, thenpresenttheexamplesinSubsection3.4.2.
3.4.1 Construction and notation
As explained in Section 2.2, πis induced by a pencil of cubics Pfrom the blowup p:X→P2
of the base locus of P. We describe a method for constructing a conic bundle ϕ:X→P1from a
pencil of curves with genus zero on P2.
Construction. LetQbe a pencil of conics (or a pencil of lines) given by a dominant rational map
ψ:P299KP1with the following properties:
(a)ψ−1(t)is smooth for all but ﬁnitely many t∈P1, i.e. the general member of Qis smooth.
(b) The indeterminacy locus of ψ(equivalently, the base locus of Q)is contained in the base locus
ofP(including inﬁnitely near points).
Now deﬁne a surjective morphism ϕ:X→P1by the composition
X P2P1p
ϕψ
Notice that ϕis a well deﬁned conic bundle. Indeed, by property (b) the points of indeterminacy
ofψare blown up under p, soϕis a morphism. By property (a) the general ﬁber of ϕis a smooth,
irreducible curve. Since Qis composed of conics (or lines), the general ﬁber of ϕhas genus zero.
Example. LetCbe a smooth cubic and let L1,L2,L3be concurrent lines. Deﬁne Pas the
pencil generated by CandL1+L2+L3. LetP1,P2∈L1∩CandP3,P4∈L3∩Cand letQbe
pencil of conics through P1,P2,P3,P4. In the following picture, Q∈Qis a general conic, so the
strict transform of Qunderpis a general ﬁber of the conic bundle ϕ:X→P1.
Remark 3.4.1. Since the base points P1,P2,P3,P4ofQare blown up under p, then the pullback
pencilp∗Qhas four ﬁxed components, namely the exceptional divisors E1,E2,E3,E4. By eliminat-
ing these we obtain a base point free pencil p∗Q−E1−E2−E3−E4, which is precisely the one
given byϕ:X→P1.

3.4.2 Examples
We exhibit two classes of examples: the extreme cases, i.e. where the conic bundle admits only
one type of single ﬁber; and the ones with various ﬁber types.
Extreme cases
By Theorem 3.3.2, there are two cases in which Xcan only admit conic bundles with exactly
one type of singular ﬁber.
(1) Whenπhas a II∗ﬁber:Xonly admits conic bundles with singular ﬁbers of type Dm≥4.
(2) Whenπhas no reducible ﬁbers: Xonly admits conic bundles with singular ﬁbers of type A2.
In Persson’s classiﬁcation list [Per90], case (1) corresponds to the ﬁrst two entries in the list (the
ones with trivial Mordell-Weil group) and case (2) corresponds to the last six entries (the ones with
maximal Mordell-Weil rank). Examples 3.4.2.1 and 3.4.2.2 illustrate cases (1) and (2) respectively.

Remark 3.4.3. The conic bundle in Example 3.4.2.1 is in fact the only conic bundle on X. This
follows from the fact that II∗is the only reducible ﬁber of πand thatE9is the only section of
X, since the Mordell-Weil group is trivial [Per90]. By examining the intersection graph of II∗, we
conclude that Dis the only divisor that constitutes a Dm≥4ﬁber.
Remark 3.4.4. A similar construction can be made to obtain π:X→P1with conﬁguration
(II∗,2I1), in which case Remark 3.4.3 also applies.

induces the conic bundle ϕ|D|:X→P1. The curve Dis anA2ﬁber ofϕ|D|.
Notice moreover that Dis not the only singular ﬁber of the conic bundle. Indeed, each line L1i

Remark 3.4.5. Since the conic bundle in Example 3.4.2.2 only admits singular ﬁbers of type A2,
which are isomorphic to a pair of lines meeting at a point, we have a standard conic bundle in the
sense of Manin and Tsfasman [MT86, Subsection 2.2].

49Chapter 4
Gaps on the intersection numbers of
sections
As in Chapter 3, we let π:X→P1be a rational elliptic surface over any algebraically closed
ﬁeldk. We remind the reader that in the proof of Theorem 3.3.2 we leave item a) to be treated in
the present chapter. This involves answering the following question: which rational elliptic surfaces
admit a pair of sections P1,P2∈E(K)such thatP1·P2= 1? The answer is given in Theorem 4.7.8,
which was only a conjecture at the time of our investigation on conic bundles and could only be
proven after a more careful study of intersection numbers of sections. This motivating problem
lead to a broader broader investigation of the possible values of intersection numbers of sections,
whose results are gathered in this chapter.
The main tool we need is the Mordell-Weil lattice (Section 2.7), which consists of a lattice
structure on E(K)/E(K)torhaving a close connection with the Néron-Severi lattice. We take
advantage of the fact that all possibilities for the Mordell-Weil lattices of Xhave been classiﬁed
in [OS91], so that the well-know information of the height-pairing gives us information about the
intersection numbers of sections of X.
By adopting this strategy, we often come across a classical problem in number theory, which
is the representation of integers by positive-deﬁnite quadratic forms. Indeed, if the free part of
E(K)is generated by rterms, then the height h(P) :=/angbracketleftP,P/angbracketrightinduces a positive-deﬁnite quadratic
form onrvariables with coeﬃcients in Q. IfO∈E(K)is the neutral section and Ris the set of
reducible ﬁbers of π, then by the height formula (2.3)
h(P) = 2 + 2(P·O)−/summationdisplay
v∈Rcontrv(P),
where the sum over vis a rational number which can be estimated (Table 2.4). By clearing
denominators, we see that the possible values of P·Odepend on a certain range of integers
represented by a positive-deﬁnite quadratic form with coeﬃcients in Z.
50We organize this chapter as follows. In Section 4.1 we deﬁne some terminology and dedicate
Section 4.2 to explaining the role of torsion sections in our investigation. The technical core of
this chapter is in Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5, where we ﬁnd necessary and suﬃcient conditions for
k∈Z≥0to be the intersection number of two sections. In Section 4.6 we list the total of suﬃcient
conditions obtained. The main results are in Section 4.7, namely: the description of gap numbers
whenE(K)is torsion-free with r= 1(Subsection 4.7.3), the absence of gap numbers for r≥5
(Subsection 4.7.1), density of gap numbers when r≤2(Subsection 4.7.2) and the classiﬁcation
of surfaces with a 1-gap (Subsection 4.7.4). We use the appendix in Chapter 6 to obtain the
information we need about Mordell-Weil lattices.
4.1 Gap numbers
We introduce some convenient terminology to express the possibility of ﬁnding a pair of sections
with a given intersection number.
Deﬁnition 4.1.1. If there are no sections P1,P2∈E(K)such thatP1·P2=k, we say that Xhas
ak-gapor thatkis agap number ofX.
Deﬁnition 4.1.2. We say that Xisgap-freeif for every k∈Z≥0there are sections P1,P2∈E(K)
such thatP1·P2=k.
Remark 4.1.3. In case the Mordell-Weil rank is r= 0, we haveE(K) =E(K)tor. In particular,
any two distinct sections are disjoint [SS19, Cor. 8.30], hence every k≥1is a gap number of X.
For positive rank, the description of gap numbers is less trivial, hence our focus on r≥1.
4.2 Intersection with a torsion section
Before dealing with more technical details in Sections 4.3 and 4.4, we explain how torsion
sections can be of help in our investigation.
We ﬁrst note some general properties of torsion sections. As the height pairing is positive-
deﬁnite on E(K)/E(K)tor, torsion sections are inert in the sense that for each Q∈E(K)torwe
have/angbracketleftQ,P/angbracketright= 0for allP∈E(K). Moreover, in the case of rational elliptic surfaces, torsion
sections also happen to be mutually disjoint by Theorem 2.2.7.
By considering the properties above, we use torsion sections to help us ﬁnd P1,P2∈E(K)such
thatP1·P2=kfor a givenk∈Z≥0. This is particularly useful when ∆≥2, in which case E(K)tor
is not trivial by Lemma 2.9.1.
The idea works as follows. Given k∈Z≥0, suppose we can ﬁnd P∈E(K)0with height
h(P) = 2k. By the height formula (2.3), P·O=k−1<k, which is not yet what we need. In the
next lemma we show that replacing Owith a torsion section Q/negationslash=OgivesP·Q=k, as desired.
51Lemma 4.2.1. LetP∈E(K)0such thath(P) = 2k. ThenP·Q=kfor allQ∈E(K)tor\{O}.
Proof.Assume there is some Q∈E(K)tor\{O}. By Theorem 2.2.7, Q·O= 0and by the height
formula (2.3), 2k= 2 + 2(P·O)−0, henceP·O=k−1. We use the height formula (2.2) for
/angbracketleftP,Q/angbracketrightin order to conclude that P·Q=k. SinceP∈E(K)0, it intersects the neutral component
Θv,0of every reducible ﬁber π−1(v), so contr v(P,Q) = 0for allv∈R. Hence
0 =/angbracketleftP,Q/angbracketright
= 1 +P·O+Q·O−P·Q−/summationdisplay
v∈Rcontrv(P,Q)
= 1 + (k−1) + 0−P·Q−0
=k−P·Q.
4.3 Necessary conditions
Ifk∈Z≥0, westatenecessaryconditionsforhaving P1·P2=kforsomesections P1,P2∈E(K).
We note that the value of ∆is not relevant in this section, but plays a decisive role for suﬃcient
conditions in Section 4.4.
Lemma 4.3.1. Letk∈Z≥0. IfP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K), then one of the following
holds:
i)h(P) = 2 + 2kfor someP∈E(K)0.
ii)h(P)∈[2 + 2k−cmax,2 + 2k−cmin]for someP /∈E(K)0.
Proof.Without loss of generality we may assume that P2is the neutral section, so that P1·O=k.
By the height formula (2.3), h(P1) = 2 + 2k−c, wherec:=/summationtext
vcontrv(P1). IfP1∈E(K)0, then
c= 0andh(P1) = 2 + 2k, hence i) holds. If P1/∈E(K)0, thencmin≤c≤cmaxby Lemma 2.8.4.
Buth(P1) = 2 + 2k−c, therefore 2 + 2k−cmax≤h(P1)≤2 + 2k−cmin, i.e. ii) holds.
Corollary 4.3.2. Letk∈Z≥0. IfP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K), thenQXrepresents some
integer in [d·(2 + 2k−cmax),d·(2 + 2k)], whered:= detE(K)0.
Proof.We apply Lemma 4.3.1 and rephrase it in terms of QX. If i) holds, then QXrepresents
d·(2 + 2k)by Lemma 2.10.3. If ii) holds, then h(P)∈[2 + 2k−cmax,2 + 2k−cmin]and by
Lemma 2.10.3, QXrepresentsd·h(P)∈[d·(2 + 2k−cmax),d·(2 + 2k−cmin)]. In both i) and ii),
QXrepresents some integer in [d·(2 + 2k−cmax),d·(2 + 2k)].
4.4 Suﬃcient conditions when ∆≤2
In this section we state suﬃcient conditions for having P1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K)
under the assumption that ∆≤2. By Lemma 2.9.1, this covers almost all cases (more precisely,
all but No. 41, 42, 59, 60 in Table 6.1). We treat ∆<2and∆ = 2separately, as the latter needs
more attention.
524.4.1 The case ∆<2
We ﬁrst prove Lemma 4.4.1, which gives suﬃcient conditions assuming ∆<2, then Corol-
lary 4.4.3, which states suﬃcient conditions in terms of integers represented by QX. This is followed
by Corollary 4.4.4, which is a simpliﬁed version of Corollary 4.4.3.
Lemma 4.4.1. Assume ∆<2and letk∈Z≥0. Ifh(P)∈[2 + 2k−cmax,2 + 2k−cmin]for some
P /∈E(K)0, thenP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K).
Proof.LetO∈E(K)be the neutral section. By the height formula (2.3), h(P) = 2 + 2(P·O)−c,
wherec:=/summationtext
vcontrv(P). Sinceh(P)∈[2 + 2k−cmax,2 + 2k−cmin], then
2 + 2k−cmax≤2 + 2(P·O)−c≤2 + 2k−cmin
⇒c−cmax
2≤P·O−k≤c−cmin
2.
ThereforeP·O−kis an integer in I:=/bracketleftbigc−cmax
2,c−cmin
2/bracketrightbig. We prove that 0is the only integer in
I, so thatP·O−k= 0, i.e.P·O=k. First notice that c/negationslash= 0, asP /∈E(K)0. By Lemma 2.8.4
iii),cmin≤c≤cmax, consequentlyc−cmax
2≤0≤c−cmin
2, i.e. 0∈I. Moreover ∆<2implies that I
has lengthcmax−cmin
2=∆
2<1, soIcontains no integer except 0as desired.
Remark 4.4.2. Lemma 4.4.1 also applies when cmax=cmin, in which case the closed interval
degenerates into a point.
The following corollary of Lemma 4.4.1 states a suﬃcient condition in terms of integers repre-
sented by the quadratic form QX(Subsection 2.10).
Corollary 4.4.3. Assume ∆<2and letd:= detE(K)0. IfQXrepresents an integer not divisible
bydin the interval [d·(2 + 2k−cmax),d·(2 + 2k−cmin)], thenP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K).
Proof.Leta1,...,ar∈Zsuch thatQX(a1,...,ar)∈[d·(2 + 2k−cmax),d·(2 + 2k−cmin)]with
d-QX(a1,...,ar). IfP1,...,Prare generators of the free part of E(K), letP:=a1P1+...+arPr.
Thend-QX(a1,...,ar) =d·h(P), which implies that h(P)/∈Z. In particular P /∈E(K)0since
E(K)0is an integer lattice. Moreover h(P) =1
dQX(a1,...,ar)∈[2 + 2k−cmax,2 + 2k−cmin]and
we are done by Lemma 4.4.1.
Thenextcorollary, althoughweakerthanCorollary4.4.3, ismorepracticalforconcreteexamples
and is frequently used in Subsection 4.7.4. It does not involve ﬁnding integers represented by QX,
but only ﬁnding perfect squares in an interval depending on the minimal norm µ(Deﬁnition 2.7.10).
Corollary 4.4.4. Assume ∆<2. If there is a perfect square n2∈/bracketleftBig
2+2k−cmax
µ,2+2k−cmin
µ/bracketrightBig
such that
n2µ /∈Z, thenP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K).
Proof.TakeP∈E(K)such thath(P) =µ. Sinceh(nP) =n2µ /∈Z, we must have nP /∈E(K)0
asE(K)0is an integer lattice. Moreover h(nP) =n2µ∈[2 + 2k−cmax,2 + 2k−cmin]and we are
done by Lemma 4.4.1.
534.4.2 The case ∆ = 2
The statement of suﬃcient conditions for ∆ = 2is almost identical to the one for ∆<2,
the only diﬀerence being that the closed interval Lemma 4.4.1 is substituted by a right half-open
interval in Lemma 4.4.6. This small change, however, is associated with a technical diﬃculty in the
case of a section with minimal contribution term, hence the separate treatment for ∆ = 2.
The results are presented in the following order. First we prove a statement about sections with
minimal contribution term (Lemma 4.4.5). Next we provide suﬃcient conditions when ∆ = 2in
Lemma 4.4.6, then prove Corollaries 4.4.7 and 4.4.8.
Lemma 4.4.5. Assume ∆ = 2. If there is P∈E(K)such that/summationtext
v∈Rcontrv(P) =cmin, then
P·Q=P·O+ 1for everyQ∈E(K)tor\{O}.
Proof.IfQ∈E(K)tor\{O}, thenQ·O= 0by Theorem 2.2.7. By the height formula (2.2),
0 =/angbracketleftP,Q/angbracketright= 1 +P·O+ 0−P·Q−/summationdisplay
vcontrv(P,Q).(∗)
Hence it suﬃces to show that contr v(P,Q) = 0∀v∈R. By Lemma 2.8.4 iv), contr v/prime(P) =cmin
for somev/primeand contr v(P) = 0for allv/negationslash=v/prime. In particular Pmeets Θv,0, hence contr v(P,Q) = 0
for allv/negationslash=v/prime. Thus from (∗)we see that contr v/prime(P,Q)is an integer, which we prove is 0.
Weclaimthat Tv/prime=A1,sothatcontr v/prime(P,Q) = 0or1
2byTable2.4. Inthiscase,ascontr v/prime(P,Q)
is an integer, it must be 0, and we are done. To see that Tv/prime=A1we analyse contr v/prime(P). Since
∆ = 2, thencmin=1
2by Table 2.6 and contr v/prime(P) =cmin=1
2. By Table 2.4, this only happens if
Tv/prime=An−1and1
2=i(n−i)
nfor some 0≤i<n. The only possibility is i= 1,n= 2,Tv/prime=A1.
With the aid of Lemma 4.4.5 we are able to state suﬃcient conditions for having P1·P2=k
for someP1,P2∈E(K)when ∆ = 2.
Lemma 4.4.6. Assume that ∆ = 2and letk∈Z≥0. Ifh(P)∈[2 + 2k−cmax,2 + 2k−cmin)for
someP /∈E(K)0, thenP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K).
Proof.By the height formula (2.3), h(P) = 2+2(P·O)−c, wherec:=/summationtext
vcontrv(P). We repeat the
arguments from Lemma 4.4.1, in this case with the right half-open interval, so that the hypothesis
thath(P)∈[2+2k−cmax,2+2k−cmin), implies that P·O−kis an integer in I/prime:=/bracketleftbigc−cmax
2,c−cmin
2/parenrightbig.
SinceI/primeis half-open with lengthcmax−cmin
2=∆
2= 1, thenI/primecontains exactly one integer. If
0∈I/prime, thenP·O−k= 0, i.e.P·O=kand we are done. Hence we assume 0/∈I/prime.
We claim that P·O=k−1. First, notice that if c>c min, then the inequalities cmin<c≤cmax
givec−cmax
2≤0<c−cmin
2, i.e. 0∈I/prime, which is a contradiction. Hence c=cmin. Since ∆ = 2, then
I/prime= [−1,0). ThusP·O−k=−1, i.e.P·O=k−1, as claimed.
Finally, let Q∈E(K)tor\{O}, so thatP·Q=P·O+ 1 =kby Lemma 4.4.5 and we are done.
We remark that E(K)toris not trivial by Table 2.6, therefore such Qexists.
The following corollaries are analogues to Corollary 4.4.3 and Corollary 4.4.4 adapted to ∆ = 2.
Similarly to the case ∆<2, Corollary 4.4.7 is stronger than Corollary 4.4.8, although the latter
is more practical for concrete examples. We remind the reader that µdenotes the minimal norm
(Deﬁnition 2.7.10).
Corollary 4.4.7. Assume ∆ = 2and letd:= detE(K)0. IfQXrepresents an integer not divisible
bydin the interval [d·(2 + 2k−cmax),d·(2 + 2k−cmin)), thenP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K).
54Proof.We repeat the arguments in Corollary 4.4.3, in this case with the half-open interval.
Corollary 4.4.8. Assume ∆ = 2. If there is a perfect square n2∈/bracketleftBig
2+2k−cmax
µ,2+2k−cmin
µ/parenrightBig
such that
n2µ /∈Z, thenP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K).
Proof.We repeat the arguments in Corollary 4.4.4, in this case with the half-open interval.
4.5 Necessary and suﬃcient conditions when ∆≤2
For completeness, we present a uniﬁed statement of necessary and suﬃcient conditions for
havingP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K)assuming ∆≤2, which follows naturally from results
in Sections 4.3 and 4.4.
Lemma 4.5.1. Assume ∆≤2and letk∈Z≥0. ThenP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K)if and
only if one of the following holds:
i)h(P) = 2 + 2kfor someP∈E(K)0.
ii)h(P)∈[2 + 2k−cmax,2 + 2k−cmin)for someP /∈E(K)0.
iii)h(P) = 2 + 2k−cminand/summationtext
v∈Rcontrv(P) =cminfor someP∈E(K).
Proof.If i) or iii) holds, then P·O=kdirectly by the height formula (2.3). But if ii) holds, it
suﬃces to to apply Lemma 4.4.1 when ∆<2and by Lemma 4.4.6 when ∆ = 2.
Conversely, let P1·P2=k. Without loss of generality, we may assume that P2=O, so that
P1·O=k. By the height formula (2.3), h(P1) = 2 + 2k−c, wherec:=/summationtext
vcontrv(P1).
Ifc= 0, thenP1∈E(K)0andh(P1) = 2+2k, so i) holds. Hence we let c/negationslash= 0, i.e.P1/∈E(K)0,
so thatcmin≤c≤cmaxby Lemma 2.8.4. In case c=cmin, thenh(P1) = 2+2k−cminand iii) holds.
Otherwisecmin<c≤cmax, which implies 2 + 2k−cmax≤h(P1)<2 + 2k−cmin, so ii) holds.
4.6 Summary of suﬃcient conditions
For the sake of clarity, we summarize in a single proposition all suﬃcient conditions for having
P1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K)proven in this chapter.
Proposition 4.6.1. Letk∈Z≥0. If one of the following holds, then P1·P2=kfor some
P1,P2∈E(K).
1)h(P) = 2 + 2kfor someP∈E(K)0.
2)h(P) = 2kfor someP∈E(K)0andE(K)toris not trivial.

4)∆<2and the quadratic form QXrepresents an integer not divisible by d:= detE(K)0in the
interval [d·(2 + 2k−cmax),d·(2 + 2k−cmin)]. In case ∆ = 2, consider the right half-open
interval.
55Proof.In 1) a height calculation gives 2 + 2k=h(P) = 2 + 2(P·O)−0, soP·O=k. For
2), we apply Lemma 4.4.5 to conclude that P·Q=kfor anyQ∈E(K)tor\{O}. In 3) we use
Corollary 4.4.4 when ∆<2and Corollary 4.4.8 when ∆ = 2. In 4), we apply Corollary 4.4.3 if
∆<2and Corollary 4.4.7 if ∆ = 2.
4.7 Applications
We prove the four main theorems of this chapter, which are independent applications of the
results from Sections 4.3 and 4.4. The ﬁrst two are general attempts to describe when and how gap
numbers occur: Theorem 4.7.2 tells us that large Mordell-Weil groups prevent the existence of gap
numbers, more precisely for Mordell-Weil rank r≥5; in Theorem 4.7.4 we show that for a smaller
Mordell-Weil group, more precisely when r≤2, gap numbers occur with probability 1. The last
two theorems, on the other hand, deal with explicit values of gap numbers: Theorem 4.7.7 provides
a complete description of gap numbers in certain cases, whereas Theorem 4.7.8 is a classiﬁcation
of all cases with a 1-gap.
4.7.1 No gap numbers in r≥5
We show that if E(K)has rankr≥5, thenXis gap-free. Our strategy is to prove that for
everyk∈Z≥0there is some P∈E(K)0such thath(P) = 2 + 2k, and by Proposition 4.6.1 1)
we are done. We accomplish this in two steps. First we show that this holds when there is an
embedding of A⊕
1or ofA4inE(K)0(Lemma 4.7.1). Second, we show that if r≥5, then such
embedding exists, hence Xis gap-free (Theorem 4.7.2).
Lemma 4.7.1. AssumeE(K)0has a sublattice isomorphic to A⊕4
1orA4. Then for every /lscript∈Z≥0
there isP∈E(K)0such thath(P) = 2/lscript.
Proof.First assume A⊕4
1⊂E(K)0and letP1,P2,P3,P4be generators for each factor A1inA⊕4
1.
Thenh(Pi) = 2and/angbracketleftPi,Pj/angbracketright= 0for distinct i,j= 1,2,3,4. By Lagrange’s four-square theorem
[HW79, §20.5] there are integers a1,a2,a3,a4such thata2
1+a2
2+a2
3+a2
4=/lscript. Deﬁning P:=
a1P1+a2P2+a3P3+a4P4∈A⊕4
1⊂E(K)0, we have
h(P) = 2a2
1+ 2a2
2+ 2a2
3+ 2a2
4= 2/lscript.
Now letA4⊂E(K)0with generators P1,P2,P3,P4. Thenh(Pi) = 2fori= 1,2,3,4and
/angbracketleftPi,Pi+1/angbracketright=−1fori= 1,2,3. We need to ﬁnd integers x1,...,x 4such thath(P) = 2/lscript, where
P:=x1P1+...+x4P4∈A4⊂E(K)0. Equivalently, we need that
/lscript=1
2/angbracketleftP,P/angbracketright=x2
1+x2
2+x2
3+x2
4−x1x2−x2x3−x3x4.
Therefore/lscriptmust be represented by q(x1,...,x 4) :=x2
1+x2
2+x2
3+x2
4−x1x2−x2x3−x3x4. We
prove that qrepresents all positive integers. Notice that qis positive-deﬁnite, since it is induced
by/angbracketleft·,·/angbracketright. By Bhargava-Hanke’s 290-theorem [BH][Thm. 1], qrepresents all positive integers if and
only if it represents the following integers:
2,3,5,6,7,10,13,14,15,17,19,21,22,23,26,
29,30,31,34,35,37,42,58,93,110,145,203,290.
The representation for each of the above is found in Table 4.1.
56We now prove the main theorem of this section.
Theorem 4.7.2. Ifr≥5, thenXis gap-free.
Proof.We show that for every k≥0there isP∈E(K)0such thath(P) = 2 + 2k, so that by
Proposition 4.6.1 1) we are done. By Lemma 4.7.1 it suﬃces to prove that E(K)0has a sublattice
isomorphic to A⊕4
1orA4.
The cases with r≥5are No. 1-7 (Table 6.1). In No. 1-6, E(K)0=E8,E7,E6,D6,D5,A5
respectively. Each of these admit an A4sublattice [Nis96, Lemmas 4.2, 4.3]. In No. 7 we claim
thatE(K)0=D4⊕A1has anA⊕4
1sublattice. This is the case because D4admits anA⊕4
1sublattice
[Nis96, Lemma 4.5 (iii)].

574.7.2 Gaps with probability 1inr≤2
Fix a rational elliptic surface π:X→P1with Mordell-Weil rank r≤2. We prove that if kis
a uniformly random natural number, then kis a gap number with probability 1. More precisely, if
G:={k∈N|kis a gap number of X}is the set of gap numbers, then G⊂Nhas density 1, i.e.
d(G) := limn→∞#G∩{1,...,n}
n= 1.
We adopt the following strategy. If k∈N\G, thenP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K)and by
Corollary 4.3.2 the quadratic form QXrepresents some integer tdepending on k. This deﬁnes a
functionf:N\G→T, whereTis the set of integers represented by QX. SinceQXis a quadratic
form onr≤2variables,Thas density 0inNby Lemma 4.7.3. By analyzing the pre-images of f,
in Theorem 4.7.4 we conclude that d(N\G) =d(T) = 0, henced(G) = 1as desired.
Lemma 4.7.3. LetQbe a positive-deﬁnite quadratic form on r= 1,2variables with integer
coeﬃcients. Then the set of integers represented by Qhas density 0inN.
Proof.LetSbe the set of integers represented by Q. Ifdis the greatest common divisor of the
coeﬃcients of Q, letS/primebe the set of integers representable by the primitive form Q/prime:=1
d·Q. By
construction S/primeis a rescaling of S, sod(S) = 0if and only if d(S/prime) = 0.
Ifr= 1, thenQ/prime(x1) =x2
1andS/primeis the set of perfect squares, so clearly d(S/prime) = 0. Ifr= 2,
thenQ/primeis a binary quadratic form and the number of elements in S/primebounded from above by x>0
is given by C·x√logx+o(x)withC > 0a constant and limx→∞o(x)
x= 0[Ber12, p. 91]. Thus
d(S/prime) = limx→∞C√logx+o(x)
x= 0.
We now prove the main result of this section.
Theorem 4.7.4. Letπ:X→P1be a rational elliptic surface with Mordell-Weil rank r≤2. Then
the setG:={k∈N|kis a gap number of X}of gap numbers of Xhas density 1inN.
Proof.Ifr= 0, then all sections are torsion sections and the claim is obvious by Theorem 2.2.7.
Assumer= 1,2. We prove that S:=N\Ghas density 0. IfSis ﬁnite, there is nothing to prove.
Otherwise, let k1<k2<...be the increasing sequence of all elements of S. By Corollary 4.3.2, for
eachnthere is some tn∈Jkn:= [d·(2 + 2kn−cmax),d·(2 + 2kn)]represented by the quadratic
formQX. LetTbe the set of integers represented by QXand deﬁne the function f:S→Tby
kn/mapsto→tn. SinceQXhasr= 1,2variables,Thas density 0by Lemma 4.7.3.
ForN > 0, letSN:=S∩{1,...,N}andTN:=T∩{1,...,N}. SinceThas density zero,
#TN=o(N), i.e.#TN
N→0whenN→∞and we need to prove that #SN=o(N). We analyze
the function frestricted to SN. Notice that as tn∈Jkn, thenkn≤Nimpliestn≤d·(2 + 2kn)≤
d·(2 + 2N). Hence the restriction g:=f|SNcan be regarded as a function g:SN→Td·(2+2k).
We claim that #g−1(t)≤2for allt∈Td·(2+2N), in which case #SN≤2·#Td·(2+2N)=o(N)
and we are done. Assume by contradiction that g−1(t)contains three distinct elements, say k/lscript1<
k/lscript2<k/lscript3witht=t/lscript1=t/lscript2=t/lscript3. Sincet/lscripti∈Jk/lscriptifor eachi= 1,2,3, thent∈Jk/lscript1∩Jk/lscript2∩Jk/lscript3. We
prove thatJk/lscript1andJk/lscript3are disjoint, which yields a contradiction. Indeed, since k/lscript1<k/lscript2<k/lscript3, in
particulark/lscript3−k/lscript1≥2, therefored·(2+2k/lscript1)≤d·(2+2k/lscript3−4). Butcmax<4by Lemma 2.8.4, so
d·(2 + 2k/lscript1)<d·(2 + 2k/lscript3−cmax), i.e. maxJk/lscript1<minJk/lscript3. ThusJk/lscript1∩Jk/lscript3=∅, as desired.
584.7.3 Identiﬁcation of gaps when E(K)is torsion-free with rank r= 1
The results in Subsections 4.7.1 and 4.7.2 concern the existence and the distribution of gap
numbers. In the following subsections we turn our attention to ﬁnding gap numbers explicitly. In
this subsection we give a complete description of gap numbers assuming E(K)is torsion-free with
rankr= 1. Such descriptions are diﬃcult in the general case, but our assumption guarantees that
eachE(K),E(K)0is generated by a single element and that ∆<2by Lemma 2.9.1, which makes
the problem more accessible.
We organize this subsection as follows. First we point out some trivial facts about generators
ofE(K),E(K)0whenr= 1in Lemma 4.7.5. Next we state necessary and suﬃcient conditions for
havingP1·P2=kwhenE(K)is torsion-free with r= 1in Lemma 4.7.6. As an application of the
latter, we prove Theorem 4.7.7, which is the main result of the subsection.
Lemma 4.7.5. LetXbe a rational elliptic surface with Mordell-Weil rank r= 1. IfPgenerates
the free part of E(K), then
a)h(P) =µ.
b)1/µis an even integer.
c)E(K)0is generated by P0:= (1/µ)Pandh(P0) = 1/µ.
Proof.Item a) is clear. Items b), c) follow from the fact that E(K)0is an even lattice and that
E(K)/similarequalL∗⊕E(K)tor, whereL:=E(K)0[OS91, Main Thm.].
InwhatfollowsweuseLemma4.7.5andresultsfromSection4.4tostatenecessaryandsuﬃcient
conditions for having P1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈E(K)in caseE(K)is torsion-free with r= 1.
Lemma 4.7.6. AssumeE(K)is torsion-free with rank r= 1. ThenP1·P2=kfor someP1,P2∈
E(K)if and only if one of the following holds:
i)µ·(2 + 2k)is a perfect square.
ii) There is a perfect square n2∈/bracketleftBig
2+2k−cmax
µ,2+2k−cmin
µ/bracketrightBig
such thatµ·n /∈Z.
Proof.By Lemma 4.7.5, E(K)is generated by some Pwithh(P) =µandE(K)0is generated by
P0:=n0P, wheren0:=1
µ∈2Z.
First assume that P1·P2=kfor someP1,P2. Without loss of generality we may assume P2=O.
LetP1=nPfor somen∈Z. We show that P1∈E(K)0implies i) while P1/∈E(K)0implies ii).
IfP1∈E(K)0, thenn0|n, henceP1=nP=mP0, wherem:=n
n0. By the height formula
(2.3), 2 + 2k=h(P1) =h(mP0) =m2·1
µ. Henceµ·(2 + 2k) =m2, i.e. i) holds.
IfP1/∈E(K)0, thenn0-n, henceµ·n=n
n0/∈Z. Moreover, h(P1) =n2h(P) =n2µand by
the height formula (2.3), n2µ=h(P) = 2 + 2k−c, wherec:=/summationtext
vcontrv(P1)/negationslash= 0. The inequalities
cmin≤c≤cmaxthen give2+2k−cmax
µ≤n2≤2+2k−cmin
µ. Hence ii) holds.
Conversely, assume i) or ii) holds. Since E(K)is torsion-free, ∆<2by Lemma 2.9.1, so we
may apply Lemma 4.4.1. If i) holds, then µ·(2 + 2k) =m2for somem∈Z. SincemP0∈E(K)0
andh(mP0) =m2
µ= 2 + 2k, we are done by Lemma 4.4.1 i). If ii) holds, the condition µ·n /∈Zis
equivalent to n0-n, hencenP /∈E(K)0. Moreover n2∈/bracketleftBig
2+2k−cmax
µ,2+2k−cmin
µ/bracketrightBig
, impliesh(nP) =
n2µ∈[2 + 2k−cmax,2 + 2k−cmin]. By Lemma 4.4.1 ii), we are done.
59An application of Lemma 4.7.6 to all possible cases where E(K)is torsion-free with rank r= 1
yields the main result of this subsection.
Theorem 4.7.7. IfE(K)is torsion-free with rank r= 1, then all the gap numbers of Xare
described in Table 4.2.

which is absurd.
4.7.4 Surfaces with a 1-gap
In Subsection 4.7.3 we take each case in Table 4.2 and describe all its gap numbers. In this
subsection we do the opposite, namely, we ﬁx a number and describe all cases having it as a gap
number. We remind the reader that our motivating problem was to determine when there are
sectionsP1,P2such thatP1·P2= 1, which induce a conic bundle having P1+P2as a reducible
ﬁber. The answer for this question is the main theorem of this subsection:
Theorem 4.7.8. LetXbe a rational elliptic surface. Then Xhas a 1-gap if and only if r= 0or
r= 1andπhas aIII∗ﬁber.
60Our strategy for the proof is the following. We already know that a 1-gap exists whenever r= 0
(Theorem 2.2.7) or when r= 1andπhas a III∗ﬁber (Theorem 4.7.7, No. 43). Conversely, we
need to ﬁnd P1,P2withP1·P2= 1in all cases with r≥1andT/negationslash=E7.
First we introduce two lemmas, which solve most cases with little computation, and leave the
remaining ones for the proof of Theorem 4.7.8. In both Lemma 4.7.9 and Lemma 4.7.11 our goal is
to analyze the narrow lattice E(K)0and apply Proposition 4.6.1 to detect cases without a 1-gap.
Lemma 4.7.9. If one of the following holds, then h(P) = 4for someP∈E(K)0.
a) The Gram matrix of E(K)0has a 4in its main diagonal.
b) There is an embedding of An⊕AminE(K)0for somen,m≥1.
c) There is an embedding of An,DnorEninE(K)0for somen≥3.
Proof.Case a) is trivial. Assuming b), we take generators P1,P2fromAn,Amrespectively with
h(P1) =h(P2) = 2. SinceAn,Amare in direct sum, /angbracketleftP1,P2/angbracketright= 0, henceh(P1+P2) = 4, as desired.
If c) holds, then the fact that n≥3allows us to choose two elements P1,P2among the generators
ofL1=An,DnorEnsuch thath(P1) =h(P2) = 2and/angbracketleftP1,P2/angbracketright= 0. Thush(P1+P2) = 4as
claimed.
Corollary 4.7.10. In the following cases, Xdoes not have a 1-gap.
•r≥3 :all cases except possibly No. 20.
•r= 1,2 :casesNo. 25, 26, 30, 32-36, 38, 41, 42, 46, 52, 54, 60 .
Proof.We look at column E(K)0in Table 6.1 to ﬁnd which cases satisfy one of the conditions a),
b), c) from Lemma 4.7.9.
a) Applies to No. 12, 17, 19, 22, 23, 25, 30, 32, 33, 36, 38, 41, 46, 52, 54, 60.
b) Applies to No. 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 24, 26, 34, 35, 42.
c) Applies to No. 1-10, 13, 16, 21.
In particular, this covers all cases with r≥3(No. 1-24) except No. 20. By Lemma 4.7.9 in
each of these cases there is P∈E(K)0withh(P) = 4and we are done by Proposition 4.6.1 1).
In the next lemma we also analyze E(K)0to detect surfaces without a 1-gap.
Lemma 4.7.11. AssumeE(K)0/similarequalAnfor somen≥1and thatE(K)has nontrivial torsion part.
ThenXdoes not have a 1-gap. This applies to cases No. 28, 39, 44, 48, 51, 57, 58 in Table 6.1.
Proof.Take a generator PofE(K)0withh(P) = 2and apply Proposition 4.6.1 2).
61We are ready to prove the main result of this subsection.
Proof of Theorem 4.7.8. We need to show that in all cases where r≥1andT/negationslash=E7there are
P1,P2∈E(K)such thatP1·P2= 1. This corresponds to cases No. 1-61 except 43 in Table 6.1.
The cases where r= 1andE(K)is torsion-free can be solved by Theorem 4.7.7, namely No.
45-47, 49, 50, 55, 56. Adding these cases to the ones treated in Corollary 4.7.10 and Lemma 4.7.11,
we have therefore solved the following:
No.1-19,21-26,28,30,32-36,38,39,41-52,54-58,60.
For the remaining cases, we apply Proposition 4.6.1 3), which involves ﬁnding perfect squares
in the interval/bracketleftBig
4−cmax
µ,4−cmin
µ/bracketrightBig
(see Table 4.3), considering the half-open interval in the cases with

Large rank jumps and the Hilbert
property
Throughout this chapter kdenotes a number ﬁeld and Xa geometrically rational elliptic
surface over kwith elliptic ﬁbration π:X→P1and Mordell-Weil rank roverk. We study the
variation of Mordell-Weil rank rt(overk) of the ﬁber π−1(t)astruns through t∈P1
kin comparison
to the generic rank rand say that there is a rank jump ifrt>r. We cover some of the approaches
used in the literature, explain their limitations and how we adapt them in order to prove the main
theorem of this chapter, namely
Theorem 5.0.1. Letπ:X→P1be a geometrically rational elliptic surface over a number ﬁeld
kwith generic rank r. Assume that πadmits a RNRF-conic bundle (Deﬁnition 5.2.2). Then the
subset of the base of the elliptic ﬁbration
{t∈P1
k|rt≥r+ 3}⊂P1
k
is not thin (Deﬁnition 2.4.1).
The starting point for our investigation is a specialization theorem by Silverman [Sil83, Thm.
C], which states that rt≥rfor all but ﬁnitely many t∈P1
k. We remark that this result is a
development from a more general theorem by Néron [Né52, Thm. 6] over higher-dimensional bases
which says that the rank is at least the generic rank outside of a thin subset (see Deﬁnition 2.4.1)
of the base curve. In light of this, our natural guiding question is: what is the nature of the set of
ﬁbers where rank jumps occur?
Techniques to deal with this question include the study of the behavior of the root numbers in
families ﬁrst carried out by Rohrlich [Roh93]; height theory estimations as done by Billard [Bil98]
and geometric techniques, more precisely base change, introduced by Néron [Né52].
A considerable limitation of the root number approach is that it relies on the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and, even with that assumption, one is restricted to Qsince the func-
tional equation is only conjectural over number ﬁelds in general. As for the use of height theory,
oftentimes one is also restricted to Q, as many properties of the height machinery are proven only
over the rationals. The geometric techniques, on the other hand, tend to allow more ﬂexibility on
the base ﬁeld and have been used by several autors, such as [Shi91, Sal12, Sal15, HS19, CT20]
63We explain Néron’s geometric method. His goal in [Né56, §5] is to start with Xwith generic
rank 8and build an elliptic surface f:Y→Csuch thatYis a degree 6cover ofXwith generic
rank at least 11 = 8 + 3 . More precisely, the elliptic ﬁbrations π:X→P1andf:Y→Care
related by the following commutative diagram.
YC
X P16:1f
π
By applying Néron’s specialization theorem, the fact that f:Y→Chas rank at least 11
implies that there are inﬁnitely many ﬁbers of πwhose ranks are at least 11 = 8 + 3 , hence a rank
jump of 3. The construction of Yis performed by taking three rational bisections L1,L2,L3inX
(Deﬁnition 2.1.4) such that the base change of π:X→P1byC:=L1×P1L2×P1L3gives the new
ﬁbrationf:Y→C, which he shows admits 3new and independent sections. A key feature of this
construction is the fact that the morphisms of the base Li→P1share a common branch point,
hence the curve L1×P1L2×P1L3has genus 1.
A generalization of this technique was made by Salgado in [Sal12] when Xis any rational elliptic
surface admitting a conic bundle over k. One key diﬀerence in comparison to Néron’s construction
is that the curves Lineed not to be given explicitly. Instead, she shows a more general result for
elliptic surfaces considering base change with respect to curves on a linear system, which produce
a strictly greater rank:
Theorem 5.0.2. [Sal12, Cor. 4.3] Let f:S→Cbe an elliptic surface over a number ﬁeld and L
a pencil of curves on Swhich does not contain a ﬁber of f. Then for all but ﬁnitely many D∈L,
the base-changed ﬁbration S×CD→Dhas generic rank strictly greater than that of f:S→C.
A drawback in this construction, however, is that the morphisms to the base D→P1which
play role of Li→P1in Néron’s construction do not necessarily admit a common branch point. In
this caseD1×P1D2may already have genus 1, which limits the number of base changes to 2. As
a consequence, one is only allowed to conclude about rank jumps of at least 2, but not 3, which is
precisely the case in [Sal12] and [LS22]. One way to overcome this diﬃculty is to consider conic
bundles with certain ramiﬁcation properties, which we call RNRF-conic bundles (forramiﬁed at a
nonreduced ﬁber , Deﬁnition 5.2.2), which allows us to detect rank jumps of at least 3.
We want, moreover, to study the structure of set of ﬁbers with rank jump of at least 3. Given
Néron’s specialization theorem, it is natural to ask whether this set is thin or not. In the case of
Néron’s construction of rank jump 3, the fact that the curves Liare rigid imply that the set is thin.
On the other hand, in Salgado’s construction [Sal12], the pencil of curves implies a larger set of
rank jumps which turns out to be notthin, as proven later in collaboration with Loughran [LS22].
By combining the technique from [Sal12] with the later developments from [LS22], we arrive at
Theorem 5.0.1, which we prove in this chapter.
We organize the chapter as follows. In Section 5.1 we explore some properties of rational elliptic
surfaces which admit a nonreduced ﬁber. In Section 5.2 we introduce a key tool, which are the
RNRFconic bundles and present their constructions. Section 5.3 is a commentary on the need to
consider nonreduced ﬁbers, which introduces the proof of the main theorem in Section 5.4. At last,
a series of examples is provided in Section 5.5.
645.1 Nonreduced ﬁbers
The central hypothesis of Theorem 5.0.1 is the presence of an RNRFconic bundle, i.e. a conic
bundle ramiﬁed at a nonreduced ﬁber (Deﬁnition 5.2.2). By nonreduced we mean a ﬁber with
one or more components with multiplicity ≥2, which by Kodaira’s classiﬁcation (Theorem 2.1.8)
correspond to starred types, i.e. I∗
n≥0,II∗,III∗,IV∗. In this section we present some results for the
case whenπ:X→P1admits a nonreduced ﬁber (Proposition 5.1.1, Corollaries 5.1.2 and 5.1.3)
and prove Lemma 5.1.5, which is helpful in the construction of conic bundles in Section 5.2.
We begin by considering a local Weierstrass form for our rational elliptic surface, namely
y2+a1xy+a3y=x3+a2x2+a4x+a6,whereai∈k(P1)for alli.
Dokchitsers’ Table 2.1 allows us to readily see that rational elliptic ﬁbrations with a nonreduced
ﬁber att=∞, except possibly I∗
0, admit a conic bundle over the x-line. More precisely, we have
the following result.
Proposition 5.1.1. Letπ:X→P1be a rational elliptic surface deﬁned over kwith a nonreduced
ﬁberFatt=∞which is not of type I∗
0. ThenXadmits a Weierstrass equation of the form
y2+a1(t)xy+a3(t)y=x3+a2(t)x2+a4(t)x+a6(t),with degai≤2for alli.
In particular, Xadmits a conic bundle by projection over the x-line.
Proof.To analyze the behavior of the ﬁber at inﬁnity, i.e. t= (1 : 0)∈P1, we write the (long)
Weierstrass equation of Xwith homogeneous coeﬃcients:
y2+a1(t,u)xy+a3(t,u)y=x3+a2(t,u)x2+a4(t,u)x+a6(t,u).
SinceXis rational, degai(t,u) =i. Dokchitsers’ Table 2.1 tells us that v∞(ai
i)≥2
3, ifFis
of type IV∗, III∗or II∗. Hence deguai≥2i
3orai= 0, which immediately bounds the degrees of
a1,a2,a3,a4anda6in the variable tfrom above by 2, as claimed.
ItremainstocheckthatthisalsoholdsforﬁbersoftypeI∗
nwithn/negationslash= 0. Inthiscase, Dokschitsers’
table tells us that v∞(ai
i)≥1
2andv∞(d)≥6. The former implies that degtai(u,t)≤2orai= 0,
fori= 1,2,3and4, while the latter gives us degta6(u,t)≤2, ora6= 0.
Corollary 5.1.2. Letπ:X→P1be a geometrically rational elliptic surface over k. Suppose that
πadmits a unique nonreduced ﬁber. Then Xisk-unirational.
Proof.We apply [KM17, Thm. 7] to the surface obtained by contracting the zero section, which is
a conic bundle of degree 1.
Corollary 5.1.3. Letπ:X→P1be a rational elliptic ﬁbration deﬁned over kwith a nonreduced
ﬁber that is not of type I∗
0. Then the subset
{t∈P1
k|rt≥r+ 2}⊂P1
k
is not thin.
Proof.Proposition 5.1.1 puts us in a position to apply [LS22, Theorem 1.1].
65Remark 5.1.4.
i)Rational elliptic surfaces with 2 ﬁbers of type I∗
0have been treated separately in [LS22] .
ii)Unfortunately one might not be able to use the conic bundles from Proposition 5.1.1 to show
that there is a rank jump of 3, which is our main goal. Indeed, the hypothesis that the
restriction of πto the conics has a common ramiﬁcation is crucial. By [LS22, Lemma 2.10],
this can only happen over nonreduced ﬁbers. Example 5.5.0.2 presents a surface with a ﬁber
of type IV∗whose conic bundle over the x-line is not ramiﬁed over the nonreduced ﬁber .
The following lemma is relevant for the construction of conic bundles in Section 5.2. It provides
a supply of divisors that can be used to form the support of a genus 0bisection over k.
Lemma 5.1.5. Letπ:X→P1be a rational elliptic surface deﬁned over kwith a nonreduced ﬁber
Fwith components Θi’s as in Table 2.2. Then one of the following holds:
i) IfF=II∗orIII∗, then all its components are deﬁned over k.
ii) IfF=IV∗, then Θ0,Θ1,Θ2are deﬁned over k. The other components are deﬁned over some
extension of kof degree at most 2.
iii) IfF=I∗
n(n≥1), then Θ0,Θ1and all the nonreduced components are deﬁned over k. The far
components Θ2,Θ3are deﬁned over some extension of kof degree at most 2.
iv) IfF=I∗
0andFis the only reducible ﬁber of π, then Θ0andΘ4are deﬁned over k. The other
components are deﬁned over an extension of kof degree at most 3.
Proof.The ﬁbration πis deﬁned over k, and, by assumption, so is its zero section O. The Galois
groupG:=Gal(k/k)acts on the Néron-Severi group preserving intersection multiplicities. Since
Fis assumed to be the unique ﬁber of its type, the elements of Gpermute the components of F.
Inparticular, thepresenceofconjugatecomponentsimpliessymmetriesintheintersectiongraph
ofF. For the sake of clarity and to avoid repetition in what follows, we state as a fact one of the
immediate consequences of the intersection-preserving action of Gin the Néron-Severi group. We
refer to it as I.F.in what follows.
Intersection Fact (I.F.): LetC,D,E⊂Xbe integral curves such that CmeetsDbut not
E. IfCis stable under G, thenD,Ecannot be conjugate.
We also note that since Ois deﬁned over k(hence stable under G) and meets Θ0, then Θ0
is necessarily stable under G. We now analyze i), ii), iii), iv) with the notation from Table 5.1.

i) LetF=II∗. For lack of symmetry, each component of Fis stable under G, as desired. Now let
F=III∗. By symmetry Θ3,Θ7are stable and the possible conjugate pairs are (Θ0,Θ6),(Θ1,Θ5),
(Θ2,Θ4). Since Θ0is stable, then so is Θ6. We use I.F.with (C,D,E ) = (Θ 0,Θ1,Θ5)so that
Θ1,Θ5are stable. Then for (C,D,E ) = (Θ 1,Θ2,Θ4)we conclude Θ2,Θ4are stable.
ii) LetF=IV∗. By symmetry, Θ2is stable and the possible G-orbits are (Θ0,Θ4,Θ6)and
(Θ1,Θ3,Θ5). Since Θ0is stable, then Θ4,Θ6are possibly conjugates, in which case both are de-
ﬁned over some L/kwith [L:k]≤2. Applying I.F.with (C,D,E ) = (Θ 0,Θ1,Θ3)and then with
(C,D,E ) = (Θ 0,Θ1,Θ5)we conclude that Θ1is stable and (Θ3,Θ5)is possibly an orbit. In this
case, Θ3,Θ5are deﬁned over some L/kwith [L:k]≤2.
iii) LetF=I∗
n≥1. By symmetry, the following pairs is a possible G-orbits: (Θi,Θn+j)where
both Θi,Θn+jare components with multiplicity 2inFandi+j= 8. Since Θ0is stable, we
applyI.F.with (C,D,E ) = (Θ 0,Θ4,Θn+4)to conclude that Θ4,Θn+4are stable. We now use
induction on i: assuming Θiis stable and applying I.F.to(C,D,E ) = (Θi,Θi+1,Θn+j+1)with
j+i= 8, we conclude that Θi+1,Θn+j+1are stable, hence all components with multiplicity 2are
stable. We are left with Θ2,Θ3. By symmetry, (Θ0,Θ1,Θ2,Θ3)is a possible orbit. But Θ0,Θ4
are stable, so Θ2,Θ3are possibly conjugates, hence both are deﬁned over some L/kwith [L:k]≤2.
iv) LetF=I∗
0. By symmetry, Θ4is stable and (Θ0,Θ1,Θ2,Θ3)is a possible G-orbit. But Θ0is
stable, so Θ1,Θ2,Θ3are possibly conjugates, all three deﬁned over some L/kwith [L:k]≤3.
675.2 Conic bundles ramiﬁed at a nonreduced ﬁber (RNRF)
We introduce conic bundles with the property that the restriction of the elliptic ﬁbration to
all conics share a ramiﬁcation point, which are the main tool in the proof of Theorem 5.0.1.
We begin by deﬁning a multisection ramiﬁed at a ﬁber of π:X→P1, which leads to the central
object of this chapter, namely the RNRF-conic bundle . We remind the reader that the presence of
a conic bundle over kis equivalent to the existence of a bisection of genus 0overkby Lemma 2.3.5.
Deﬁnition 5.2.1. LetC⊂Xbe a multisection π:X→P1. We say that Cisramiﬁed at the
ﬁberπ−1(t)if the ﬁnite morphism π|C:C→P1branches at t.
Deﬁnition 5.2.2. Letϕ|D|:X→P1be a conic bundle induced by a bisection D⊂X. Ifπ
has a unique nonreduced ﬁber F, we say that this is an RNRF-conic bundle ifDis ramiﬁed at
F. Equivalently, if each C∈|D|intersects (transversally) a nonreduced component of F. The
acronym RNRFstands for Ramiﬁed at a Nonreduced Fiber .
RNRF-conic bundles arise naturally on rational elliptic surfaces with a nonreduced ﬁber. The
following result tells us that they exist over kwithout any further assumption depending on the
type of nonreduced ﬁber, and gives conditions for it to happen in the remaining conﬁgurations.
Proposition 5.2.3. Letπ:X→P1be a rational elliptic surface over k. Assume that one of the
following holds:
1. It admits a ﬁber of type II∗, III∗orI∗
nforn∈{2,3,4}.
2. It admits a ﬁber of type IV∗orI∗
m, form∈{0,1}and a reducible, reduced ﬁber.
3. It admits a ﬁber of type IV∗and a non-trivial section deﬁned over k.
4. It admits a ﬁber of type I∗
1and a non-trivial section deﬁned over kthat intersects the near
component.
5. It admitsa ﬁberof type I∗
1and twonon-intersecting sections that are conjugateunder Gal (k/k).
6. It admits 2 ﬁbers of type I∗
0and a non-trivial 2-torsion section deﬁned over k.
ThenXadmits a RNRF-conic bundle over k.
Proof.For each possible conﬁguration listed in the hypothesis of the theorem, we provide an ef-
fective divisor DonX(see Table 5.2) such that D2= 0,D·F= 2and such that every D/prime∈|D|
intersects a nonreduced component of F. Moreover, by Lemma 5.1.5, the divisor Dis deﬁned over
k, i.e. it remains invariant by the action of Gal (k/k).
To prove that π|D:D→P1is ramiﬁed above F, we only need to observe that each D
constructed meets Fat a nonreduced component.
68Remark 5.2.4.
i)Conics in a RNRF-conic bundle are distinguished in the following sense. Generally, a degree 2
base change of a rational elliptic surface produces a K3 surface. This is true if the base change
is ramiﬁed in smooth ﬁbers, and remais true even if it ramiﬁes at reduced singular ﬁbers if one
considers the desingularization of the base changed surface. On the other hand, if a degree 2
base change ramiﬁes at a nonreduced ﬁber, then by an Euler number calculation one can show
that the base changed surface is still rational (see Lemma 5.2.5).
ii)It is natural to wonder about the extra conditions on surfaces with ﬁbers of type IV∗, I∗
1, I∗
0.
One can show that surfaces with such ﬁber conﬁguration always admit a conic bundle over k.
Nevertheless, such a conic bundle is not necessarily a RNRF-conic bundle. It is worth noticing
that, on the other hand, the isotrivial rational surfaces with 2I∗
0admit a RNRF-conic bundle.
In this particular setting it is called a Châtelet bundle (see [LS22, Lemma 3.3]) since they
occur as conic bundles on a Châtelet surface obtained after blowing down the sections of π.
Still, they are useless for our purposes as all ﬁbers ramify above the same 2nonreduced ﬁbers,
not leaving the degree of freedom needed to avoid certain covers when verifying that the rank
jump occurs on a not thin subset.
The following result justiﬁes the study of RNRF-conic bundles on rational elliptic surfaces. It
tells us that the base change of a rational elliptic ﬁbration by a bisection in an RNRF-conic bundle
is again a rational elliptic ﬁbration. This allows us to apply [LS22, Thm. 1.1] to the base-changed
rational elliptic surface and achieve a higher rank jump.
Lemma 5.2.5. Letπ:X→P1be a rational elliptic surface with only one nonreduced ﬁber F. Let
D⊂Xbe a genus 0bisection ramiﬁed at F, and letXDbe the normalization of the base change
surfaceX×P1D. ThenXDis a rational elliptic surface and |D|induces a conic bundle on XD.
Proof.Letϕ:=π|D:D→P1be the base change map. The curve Dis rational, so by Hurwitz
formulaϕhas two branch points. By hypothesis, these two points correspond to Fand some other
reduced ﬁber. By inspection of possible singular ﬁbers in a rational elliptic surface [Per90], Fis
one of the following:
I∗
nwith 0≤n≤4,II∗,III∗or IV∗.
By the ramiﬁcation of ϕ, there is precisely one ﬁber F/primeinXDaboveF. An inspection of
Table 2.3, conﬁrms a pattern for the Euler number, namely, e(F/prime) = 2e(F)−12(∗).
Moreover, if Gis any singular ﬁber of πdistinct from F, we claim that/summationtext
G/primee(G/prime) = 2e(G)
(∗∗), whereG/primeruns through the ﬁbers of XDaboveG(sinceϕhas degree 2, there are at most 2
possibilities for G/prime). Indeed, if there is no ramiﬁcation associated to G, then there are two ﬁbers
G/prime
1,G/prime
2isomorphic to G, hencee(G/prime
1) +e(G/prime
2) = 2e(G). In case there is ramiﬁcation, there is only
one possibility for G/primeande(G/prime) = 2e(G)for all cases by Table 2.3. This proves (∗∗).
69We prove that XDis rational by checking that e(XD) = 12and applying Lemma 2.2.4. Since
Xis rational, then e(X) = 12and combining (∗), (∗∗) we get
e(XD) =e(F/prime) +/summationdisplay
G/prime/negationslash=F/primee(G/prime)
=e(F/prime) +/summationdisplay
G/negationslash=F/summationdisplay
G/primee(G/prime)
= 2e(F)−12 + 2/summationdisplay
G/negationslash=F2e(G)
= 2e(X)−12
= 12,
as desired. In order to prove that |D|induces a conic bundle on XD, take an arbitrary C∈|D|
and letψ:=π|C:C→P1. As inϕ, the mapψhas2branch points. Let ν:XD→X×P1Dbe
the normalization map and E⊂XDthe strict transform of C×P1Dunderν. We prove that Eis
smooth of genus 0, so that|E|induces a conic bundle on XD. We have the following diagram:

The singularities of C×P1Dare the points (c,d)∈C×Dsuch thatψ,ϕramify atc,drespec-
tively. These are also singular points of X×P1D, which are eliminated by ν, henceEis smooth.
Sinceϕhas degree 2, thenE→Chas degree 2and, moreover, has 2branch points, namely the
ones where ψramiﬁes. By Hurwitz formula, g(E) = 0as desired.
705.3 RNRF and multiple base changes
In [Sal12] and [LS22], the authors use 2base changes by curves in a conic bundle to show that
the rank jumps by at least 2. The ﬁnal base for the base changed ﬁbration is an elliptic curve with
positive Mordell-Weil rank. One is tempted to consider a third base change to increase the rank
jump further. Unfortunately, this cannot be done in such generality. Indeed, the genus of a new
base after a third base change would be at least 2. In particular, the base curve would have a ﬁnite
set ofk-points thanks to Faltings’ theorem [Fal83].
Rational elliptic surfaces with a nonreduced ﬁber on the other hand allow for a sequence of
3 base changes with ﬁnal base curve of genus 1. Further hypotheses on the surface allow us to
show that the genus 1 curve is an elliptic curve with positive Mordell–Weil rank. Indeed, Lemma
5.2.5 assures that the ﬁrst base change by an RNRF-conic bundle produces a surface that is again
rational and moreover admits a conic bundle. In other words, admits a bisection of arithmetic
genus 0as in the hypothesis of [LS22, Theorem 2]. One can then take the latter as the starting
point and apply [LS22, Theorem 2] to conclude. This is explained in detail in the following section.
5.4 Rank Jump three times
In this section we make use of an RNRF-conic bundle on a rational elliptic surface with a
unique nonreduced ﬁber to show that the collection of ﬁbers for which the Mordell–Weil rank is at
least the generic rank plus 3 is not thin as a subset of the base of the ﬁbration.
Throughout this section, π:X→P1is a geometrically rational elliptic surface with a unique
nonreduced ﬁber FandDis a bisection of πsuch that|D|is a RNRF-conic bundle.
We letψi:Yi→P1, fori∈I, be an arbitrary ﬁnite collection of ﬁnite morphisms of degree ≥2,
as in the discussion at the end of Section 2.4. Our goal is to show that there is a curve X⊃Cϕ→P1
such that:
1.C(k)is inﬁnite;
2. rank (X×P1C)(k(C))≥r+ 3;
3.∃P∈ϕ(C(k))⊂P1(k)such thatP /∈/uniontext
iψ(Yi(k)).
Lemma 5.4.1. Assumeπ:X→P1has a unique non-reduced ﬁber. Then for all D1∈|D|, there
are inﬁnitely many pairs (D2,D3)∈|D|×|D|such thatD1×P1D2×P1D3is a curve of genus 1.
Proof.For a given a D1, there are only ﬁnitely many D2,D3∈|D|such thatD2orD3share 2
common ramiﬁcation points with D1. We exclude these. The 3 quadratic extensions k(Di)are
non-isomorphic as they have precisely one ramiﬁcation point in common. Hence they are linearly
disjoint and the curve C=D1×P1D2×P1D3is geometrically integral. Our hypothesis on the
common ramiﬁcation implies moreover that the curve D1×P1D2has genus 0(see [LS22, Lemma
5.2]). Lett,ti∈P1(k)be the two branch points of Di→P1wheretis the common branch point
corresponding to the nonreduced ﬁber, and ti/negationslash=tj, fori/negationslash=j. Consider the degree 2morphism
φ:D1×P1D2×P1D3→D1×P1D2. Thenφis ramiﬁed at the four points above t3∈P1(k). A
direct application of the Hurwitz formula gives that Cis a curve of genus 1.
71Proposition 5.4.2. Assumeπ:X→P1has a unique nonreduced ﬁber and let P={P1,···,Pm}
be a ﬁnite subset of P1
k. Then there are inﬁnitely many D1,D2,D3∈|D|such that:
a)C:=D1×P1D2×P1D3is an elliptic curve with positive Mordell-Weil rank over k;
b)k(D1)⊗k(D2)⊗k(D3)is linearly disjoint with every k(Yi);
c) The rank of the generic ﬁber of XC→Cis at leastr+ 3;
d)Cramiﬁes above exactly one of Pj.
Proof.This proof is analogous to the proof of [LS22, Prop. 4.1]. We may assume that Pcontains
all branch points of Yiand the singular locus of π. In particular, it contains a ramiﬁcation point
of all conics in|D|. We call this point P1. After choosing D1andD2in an inﬁnite set such that
the rank of the generic ﬁber of the elliptic ﬁbration π12:XD1×BD2→D1×P1D2is at leastr+ 2
andD1×P1D2(k)is inﬁnite and XD1×P1D2(k)is Zariski dense as in [LS22], allowing D3to vary in
|D|gives by Lemma 5.4.1 an inﬁnite family of elliptic curves with positive Mordell-Weil rank that
are bisections of π12. By Theorem 5.0.2, all but ﬁnitely many of such curves can be used to base
change and obtain an elliptic surface XC→CwithC=D1×P1D2×P1D3and generic ﬁber of
rank at least r+ 3.
The ﬁbration πhas a unique nonreduced ﬁber so after excluding ﬁnitely many curves when
pickingD1,D2andD3we may assume that Di’s are not ramiﬁed over other singular ﬁbers of π,
nor do they share ramiﬁcation points with Yiother than possibly P1. This proves d).
The following result is parallel to [LS22, Lemma 5.5]. Since we construct conic bundles whose
members are always ramiﬁed at a nonreduced singular ﬁber, we need to reprove the result. For-
tunately, that comes with no cost as elliptic ﬁbrations deﬁned over global ﬁelds have at least two
singular ﬁbers.
Lemma5.4.3. The elliptic surface X×P1C→Cis nonconstant, i.e. not isomorphic to E×C→C,
whereEis an elliptic curve.
Proof.The surface X→P1is a relatively minimal geometrically rational elliptic surface deﬁned
over a global ﬁeld. In particular, it has at least 2singular ﬁbers. Hence there is at least 1reduced
singular ﬁber F. Since we chose Csuch thatC→P1is not ramiﬁed at F, the pull-back of Fto
X×P1C→Cis a singular ﬁber.
We have at hand all the tools needed to prove our main result.
Proof of Theorem 5.0.1. WechooseCasinProposition5.4.2. Byconstruction,thecurves D1,D2,D3,
andYiare smooth and the respective maps to P1share at most one branch point. On the other
hand, the map C×P1Yi→Cis branched on the ramiﬁcation points of Yi→P1. A direct application
of the Riemann-Hurwitz formula gives g(C×P1Yi)≥2. In particular, by Faltings’ theorem [Fal83],
C×P1Yi(k)is ﬁnite. To conclude, we invoke part c) of Proposition 5.4.2 and apply Theorem 5.0.2
to the nonconstant elliptic surface X×P1C→C.

thenXadmits a ﬁber of type II∗.
The surface Xadmits a RNRF-conic bundle over the x-line. In case ii)this is the unique conic
bundle on the surface. A nice geometric description for this case is as follows. Let Cbe a plane
cubic with an inﬂection point Pdeﬁned over k. LetLbe the line tangent to CatP. We consider
the following pencil of plane cubics
uC+t(3L) = 0,(t:u)∈P1,
whose base locus is the nonreduced scheme {9P}. We consider its 9-fold blow up and obtain a
rational elliptic surface with a ﬁber of type II∗at inﬁnity. The unique conic bundle on it is given
by the strict transforms of the pencil of lines through P. By following the blow ups one sees readily
that all conics intersect the unique double component of the ﬁber of type II∗(Figure 5.1).
Figure 5.1: RNRF-conic bundle (pink) on Xwith aII∗ﬁber.
73Example 5.5.0.2. LetF=y2z−x3+x2z+xz2−z3andG=z2(y−z)be two plane cubics. Let
P1= (0 : 1 : 0) andPi= (xi: 1 : 1)withxi, fori= 2,3,4, the 3 roots of the polynomial x3−x2−x.
HenceF,Gmeet at the nonreduced scheme F∩G={6P1,P2,P3,P4}. LetXbe the blow up of P2
inF∩G. Then its (aﬃne) Weierstrass equation is
y2−ty=x3−x2−x+ (t−1).
Inparticular, XhasaﬁberoftypeIV∗att=∞and, asexpectedbyProposition5.1.1, itadmits
aconicbundleoverthe x-line. Geometrically, theﬁberoftypeIV∗isgivenbyG/prime−E1−E2−E3−E4,
whereG/primeis the proper transform of GandEiis the exceptional divisor above Pi. IfDis a ﬁber of
the conic bundle over the x-line thenD=/lscript1−E1, where/lscript1is the proper transform of a line through
P1. In particular, for all lines through P1, except the 3lines that pass through P2,P3orP4, the
curveDintersects the ﬁber IV∗transversally in the simple component given by m−E2−E3−E4
wheremis the proper transform of the line y=z, and in a simple component above the blow up
ofP1. Hence the restriction of the elliptic ﬁbration to all but 3conics is not ramiﬁed at IV∗and,
in particular, cannot all share a common ramiﬁcation. In other words, the conic bundle over the
x-line is not a RNRF-conic bundle.
Nevertheless, Xadmits a RNRF-conic bundle, namely the one given by |/lscript2−E2|, where/lscript2is
the proper transform of a line through P2. Indeed,/lscript2intersects the double component of IV∗above
the strict transform of z2= 0. SinceP2= (0 : 1 : 1) , the conic bundle is deﬁned over Q. Thus
there are inﬁnitely many t∈Qsuch thatrt≥1 + 3 = 4 (Figure 5.2).
Example 5.5.0.3. LetXbe the rational elliptic surface studied by Washington in [Was87] with
Weierstrass equation
y2=x3+tx2−(t+ 3)x+ 1.
The generic Mordell-Weil rank of this surface over Qis 1. Its singular ﬁbers are of type (I∗
2,2II).
In particular, by Proposition 5.2.3, it admits a RNRF-conic bundle deﬁned over Q. We can apply
Theorem 5.0.1 to conclude that the subset of ﬁbers of rank at least 4 is not thin.
For this surface, we can expect an even higher rank jump on a non-thin set. Indeed, Rizzo
proved in [Riz03, Thm. 1] that the root number of each ﬁber is −1. Hence, under the Parity
conjecture [Dok13], the rank of all ﬁbers is odd. This together with Theorem 5.0.1 would imply
that the set of ﬁbers with rank at least 5 is not thin. In other words, under the Parity conjecture,
there is a rank jump of at least 4 for a non-thin set of ﬁbers.
