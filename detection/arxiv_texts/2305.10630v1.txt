ABSTRACT
The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE ) observed the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630{47
in the steep power law (or very high) state. The observations reveal a linear polarization degree of
the 2{8 keV X-rays of 6 :80:2% at a position angle of 21 :30:9 East of North (all errors at 1 
condence level). Whereas the polarization degree increases with energy, the polarization angle stays
constant within the accuracy of our measurements. We compare the polarization of the source in
the steep power-law state with the previous IXPE measurement of the source in the high soft state.
We nd that even though the source ux and spectral shape are signicantly dierent between the
high soft state and the steep power-law state, their polarization signatures are similar. Assuming that
the polarization of both the thermal and power-law emission components are constant over time, we
estimate the power-law component polarization to be 6.8{7.0% and note that the polarization angle of
the thermal and power-law components must be approximately aligned. We discuss the implications
for the origin of the power-law component and the properties of the emitting plasma.

1.INTRODUCTION
Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) harbor a stellar mass black hole in close orbit with a companion star. The
matter accreting onto the central black hole forms an accretion disk which is heated by internal frictions to the point
of emitting radiation that typically peaks in the X-ray band. BHXRB sources are found in dierent spectral states.
The two main states, the high soft and low hard states (HSS and LHS, respectively), exhibit a spectrum that can be
roughly described as a combination of both a soft thermal component and a harder electron-scattering component with
reection by a cold medium. In the HSS, the X-rays are dominated by the thermal accretion disk emission followed
by a non-thermal tail extending beyond 500 keV. This state is often tted with a multi-temperature blackbody model
and a power law /E  with a photon index of   2 2:2 (Zdziarski & Gierli nski 2004). In the LHS, the X-ray
emission is dominated instead by photons that Compton scatter in a hot coronal plasma, though a low-temperature
disk component can still be detected (McClintock & Remillard 2006). In this state, BHXRB spectra consist of a cuto
power-law component with a typical photon index of 1 :5 2:0 and an exponential cuto at high ( 100 keV)
energies as well as reected emission from the corona o the disk (George & Fabian 1991; Done et al. 2007). BHXRBs
can also be found in the steep power law (SPL) or very high state. The SPL state is characterized by competing
thermal and power-law components|where the power-law component has a photon index of   >2:4 (steeper than
the higher energy tail of the HSS and the   1:7 detected in the LHS) (Remillard & McClintock 2006).
The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE , Weisskopf et al. 2022) is a space-based observatory launched on
2021 December 9. IXPE has measured the linear polarization of the 2{8 keV X-rays from several BHXRBs, giving new
insights into the conguration and properties of their emitting plasmas. The IXPE observations of the BHXRB Cyg
X-1 in the LHS revealed a 4% polarization aligned with the black hole radio jet, supporting the hypothesis that the
jet might be launched from the black hole inner X-ray emitting region (Krawczynski et al. 2022). These results also
revealed that the hot coronal plasma is extended parallel to the accretion disk plane and is seen at a higher inclination
than the binary. IXPE observed a high polarization degree of 20% perpendicular to radio ejections of the black hole
candidate Cyg X-3 suggesting that the primary source is inherently highly luminous but obscured so that only the
reected emission can be observed (Veledina et al. 2023). The IXPE observations of the low-inclination high-mass
BHXRB LMC X-1 in the HSS gave only an upper limit on the total polarization degree of <2:2% (Podgorny et al.
2023) for a combination of two main spectral components: dominant thermal emission with a modest contribution of
Comptonization.
Observations of the transient low-mass X-ray binary (LMXRB) 4U 1630{47 with the Uhuru satellite were rst
reported in Forman et al. (1976) and Jones et al. (1976), describing four outbursts occurring every 600 days.
The X-ray spectral and timing properties of the LMXRB during an outburst in 1984 suggest the compact object of
4U 1630{47 is a black hole candidate (Parmar et al. 1986) albeit with unusual outburst behavior (Chatterjee et al.
2022) indicative of a more complex system. The source spectrum tends to show strong, blueshifted absorption lines
corresponding to Fe XXV and Fe XXVI transitions during the soft accretion states (Pahari et al. 2018; Gatuzz et al.
2019). Previous measurements of the 4U 1630{47 dust-scattering halo were used to estimate a distance range of 4.7{
11.5 kpc (Kalemci et al. 2018). From the detection of short-duration dips in its X-ray light curve during outburst, a
relatively high inclination of 60{75has been inferred (Kuulkers et al. 1998). Various reection spectral modeling
eorts have consistently measured a high spin: a= 0:985+0:005
 0:014(King et al. 2014), a= 0:920:04 (Pahari et al. 2018),
anda&0:9 (Connors et al. 2021).
IXPE previously observed 4U 1630{47 in the HSS where the detected emission was primarily from the thermal
accretion disk (Ratheesh et al. 2023, henceforth Paper I). That observation revealed that the polarization degree
increased with energy from 6% at 2 keV to10% at 8 keV. The high polarization degree and its energy dependence
cannot be explained in terms of a standard geometrically thin accretion disk with a highly or fully ionized accretion
disk atmosphere (Chandrasekhar 1960; Sobolev 1949, 1963). While a standard thin disk viewed at inclinations &85
would produce a suciently high energy-integrated polarization degree, relativistic eects would lead to a decrease
of the polarization degree with energy contrary to the observed increase. Such a high inclination would also lead
to eclipsing of the source which has not been detected. In Paper I we argue that a geometrically thin disk with a
partially ionized, outowing emitting plasma can explain the observations. The absorption in the emitting plasma
leads to escaping emission that is likelier to have scattered only once and ends up being highly polarized parallel to the

disk surface (Loskutov & Sobolev 1979, 1981; Taverna et al. 2021). A vertically outowing emitting plasma leads to
increased emission angles in the local disk frame due to relativistic aberration resulting in a higher polarization degree
(e.g. Beloborodov 1998; Poutanen et al. 2023). Including absorption eects and the relativistic motion in the models
achieves proper ts of the data for a thin accretion disk of a slowly spinning ( a0:5) black hole seen at inclination

In this letter, we report on the rst measurement of the polarization properties of a BHXRB in the SPL state. The
letter is organized as follows. We describe the IXPE , NICER, and NuSTAR observational results of 4U 1630{47 in
Section 2 and present a comparison of the polarization of the source in the HSS and the SPL states. In Section 3,
we examine our results in the context of previous IXPE X-ray polarization measurements of BHXRBs and discuss
scenarios that could explain the observed polarization signature.
2.DATA SETS, ANALYSIS METHODS, AND RESULTS
IXPE performed a target of opportunity (ToO) observation of 4U 1630{47 between 2023 March 10 and 14 for 150 ks
after daily monitoring of the source by the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) on the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI)
(Matsuoka et al. 2009) reported a signicant increase in ux, as shown in Figure 1a. The MAXI ux was about
0:62 ph s 1cm 2during the gray highlighted region of the gure which coincides with the Paper I observation|
hereby referred to as the HSS data. The blue and green highlighted regions have a higher ux of approximately
2:24 ph s 1cm 2and 2:77 ph s 1cm 2, respectively, signaling a change in the emission state of the source. During
these later time intervals, the 4{20 keV ux shown in purple in Figure 1a increases more drastically than the 2{4 keV5

ux shown in orange indicating an increase in the spectral hardness over this time. Figure 1b shows the IXPE , NICER
(Gendreau et al. 2012), and NuSTAR (Harrison et al. 2013) 2{8, 0.2{12, and 3{78 keV count rates during these later
intervals. We see the source ux increased dramatically around the time marked in the gure by the vertical dashed
line: the IXPE , NICER, and NuSTAR count rates increased by 23%,25%, and63%, respectively. The blanket
IXPE coverage reveals that this increase was very sudden (about 2:6 ks). Owing to the drastic change, we divided
ourIXPE , NICER, and NuSTAR observations into Period 1 (blue) to Period 2 (green) before and after 13:42:53 UTC
on 2023 March 11. For a description of the IXPE , NICER, and NuSTAR data reduction, see Appendix A.
A comparison of the NICER and NuSTAR spectra in Figure 2a for the HSS observation (black) and Periods 1
and 2 (blue and green) reveals that the source transitioned from the HSS to the SPL state. In Paper I, the power-law
component of the spectra contributed 3% of the energy ux in the IXPE energy band. In contrast, our spectral
tting (see Appendix B) reveals that in Period 1 of the SPL state the power-law emission contributed 17{46% of
the 2{8 keV emission while in Period 2 this contribution increased to 40{92%. The soft HSS spectra are almost
completely thermal in the form of a multi-temperature black body while the SPL spectra show an additional steep
power-law component. From Figure 2a, we can see the SPL state shows an increase in 2{50 keV ux and a change
in the spectral shape at energies above 5 keV. Only the HSS spectra exhibit prominent blueshifted Fe XXV and
Fe XXVI lines as previously seen in past outbursts and explained in terms of over-ionization of the wind (D az Trigo
et al. 2014) or of an intrinsic change of the physical properties of the wind itself (Hori et al. 2014) in the SPL state.
Figure 2b shows a hardness{intensity diagram (HID) of 4U 1630{47 NICER data including the HSS (black) and SPL
(blue and green) observations contemporaneous with the IXPE measurements, and archival data. Period 2 exhibits the
highest rate corresponding to the largest relative contribution of the power-law ux. The energy ux in the 1{12 keV
band increases with hardness during the transition from the HSS to the SPL state saturating at 1496 s 1. Most
astrophysical black hole candidates move through a hardness-intensity diagram counter-clockwise during outbursts
(see Figure 7 of Fender et al. 2004 and Figure 1 of Homan & Belloni 2005). However, Figure 2b shows 4U 1630{47
evolving in a clockwise direction near the apex of the HID consistent with previous Suzaku observations of the source
in the SPL state (Hori et al. 2014). We note that the variable motion of the source along the HID (see Figure 11 of
Tomsick et al. 2005) makes it unclear if the source transitions from the HSS to the LHS through a high-intensity SPL
regime or if we caught the source in an unusual pattern of motion. Furthermore, Figure 2b shows no evident bright
hard state, consistent with the results of Capitanio et al. (2015) which could indicate a deviation from the standard
HID Q-track shape proposed in Fender et al. (2004). Alternatively, Tomsick et al. (2014) suggest that a low large-scale
magnetic eld in the disk could delay the transition to the LHS.
During the entire SPL state observation, IXPE measured an energy-averaged 2{8 keV linear polarization degree
(PD) of 6:80:2% at a polarization angle (PA) 21 :30:9 (East of North) with a statistical condence of over 30 .
The SPL state observation has a 1 :5% smaller PD than the 8 :320:17% HSS PD reported in Paper I at a PA 3 :5 higher6

The black line and transparent contours show the polarization in the HSS reported in Paper I. The red solid line and solid
contours show the polarization in the SPL state (this paper). The shaded and unshaded ellipses show their 68 :3% and 99:7%
condence regions, respectively. Errors on PD and PA computed by ixpeobssim are derived from the QandUgaussian errors
according to the formalism developed by Kislat et al. (2015).
with respect to the previously observed 17 :80:6. Figure 3 shows the time-averaged polarization signature during
both states in 5 logarithmic energy bands. The PA is constant within 3 during the HSS and SPL observations. The
summary of measured PD and PA in dierent spectral states is given in Table 1. These values have been computed
using the PCUBE algorithm of the ixpeobssim analysis software (Baldini et al. 2022). Figure 4 shows linear and constant
ts of PD and PA, respectively, obtained using xspec (Arnaud 1996). The HSS and SPL state observations have a
similar linear dependence of the PD on the photon energy E, with a linear model PD = p0+(E=1 keV). For the HSS,
the reported values are p0= 3:470:54%,= 1:120:13% with the null hypothesis probability of 3 :5510 16for a
constant function. For the SPL state Period 1 observation, these parameters change to p0= 2:71:3%,= 1:080:32%
with the null hypothesis probability of 1 :4210 2for a constant function. For the SPL state Period 2 observation,
these parameters are p0= 2:440:70%,= 0:880:16% with the null hypothesis probability of 4 :5610 7for a
constant function. Both the HSS and SPL Period 1 and Period 2 observations show relatively energy-independent PA
in the IXPE band, with the tted value of PA being 18 :00:5, 21:41:8 and 21:50:9 with the null hypothesis
probability of 0.607, 0.854 and 0.877, respectively.7

in this paper. Linear ts for PD and constant t for PA are also shown in dotted lines (see the text for the t details).
To study the polarization properties of the power-law component, we performed a polarimetric t of the data
starting from the spectral analysis described in Appendix B. We included the IXPEQandUspectra in the spectral
t and convolved the thermal and power-law spectral components with two pollin models1. This allowed us to
attribute polarization to each component separately assuming that the PD depends linearly on the photon energy E:
PD =p0+(E=1 keV). In Paper I, we found that the only spectral component contributing signicantly to the HSS
emission is the thermal one. We assumed that the polarization of this thermal component remains constant between
the HSS and SPL states requiring that p0Thermal = 3:47% andThermal = 1:12% as per the HSS t shown in Figure 4a.
Due to the relatively constant PA during the HSS, SPL Period 1, and SPL Period 2 observations (Figure 4b), we further
assumed that the thermal and non-thermal components have equal PA and allowed it to vary between SPL periods.
Additionally, the PA appears to be energy-independent so our ts take the PA to be constant with energy: PA=  .
As shown in Table 1, the estimates of the power-law component ux contribution depend on the model parameters
used and will therefore also aect the estimate of the polarization properties of the power-law component. Figure 5
summarizes the results of our linear ts for the non-thermal component PD resulting from Fits 1 and 2 as well as the
assumed thermal component PD for comparison. For Fit 1, we assumed a multi-color blackbody as the Comptonized
component input radiation (Figure 6a). For the PD of the power-law component, we found that Fit1= 1:050:45%

and we set an upper limit on p0Fit1of 2:7%. Thep0Fit1upper limit tells us that the Comptonization component could
be unpolarized at 0 keV but this is just an extrapolation|the power-law PD in the 2{8 keV energy range (Figure 5)
shows that the component is polarized. The computed PAs for Period 1 and Period 2 are  Fit1{P1 = 21:03:4 and
 Fit1{P2 = 21:72:2. For Fit 2 (Figure 6b), we assume a simple blackbody as a seed for the power-law radiation. In
this case, the thermal emission is the main source of ux in the 2{8 keV energy range for both Periods 1 and 2. The
PD of the power-law component can be tted with Fit2= 0:960:26% and we were only able to set an upper limit on
p0Fit2of 1:3%. The corresponding PAs for Period 1 and Period 2 are  Fit2{P1 = 21:03:5 and Fit2{P2 = 21:72:1.
We also calculated the 2{8 keV average PD of the power-law component from the IXPEI,Q, andUuxes. For Fit 1,
we get 7:03:2% and 6:82:6% in Periods 1 and 2, respectively. For Fit 2, we get 6 :83:9% and 7:02:2% in
Periods 1 and 2, respectively.
3.DISCUSSION
IXPE observed 4U 1630{47 in the HSS (Paper I) and in the SPL state (this paper). We nd that the HSS and SPL
exhibit surprisingly similar polarization properties despite their very dierent energy spectra. Although the PD of the
HSS (increasing from 6% to 10% between 2 to 8 keV) exceeded that of the SPL observations (increasing from 5% to
8% between 2 to 8 keV), and Figure 4a shows that the PD of Period 2 decreases with respect to Period 1, we note
that the PD varied as much during the HSS observations (Fig. M3 of Paper I) as it did between the HSS and the SPL
observations. The change in polarization direction 3:5 is not statistically signicant (3 ). While the HSS spectrum
was dominated by the thermal component, our spectral analysis shows that the Comptonization component increased
by a large factor between the HSS, SPL Period 1 and Period 2, although its exact ux contribution is model parameter-
dependent. Since the polarization angle stays almost the same with vastly dierent ux contributions of the power-law
component, this component has to be polarized in a similar direction as the thermal component. Our polarimetric
analysis reveals that the power-law component has an energy-integrated PD of 6.8{7.0% in both cases analyzed, i.e.
using either multicolor disk blackbody or single temperature blackbody as seed photons for Comptonization. Since
both cases suggest substantially dierent contributions of this component to the total ux, we consider this estimate
to be quite independent of the model assumptions. Note that the dominating thermal component in HSS had a PD
of 8.3 %, thus the Comptonized component is slightly less polarized than the thermal one by approximately 1.3{1.5%.
This congruence of the PD and directions is puzzling if the emission comes from spatially distinct regions and is
produced by dierent physical emission mechanisms. Direct thermal emission from the disk tends to be polarized
parallel to the accretion disk except for close to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) where strong gravitational9
eects rotate the PA by about 10(Connors & Stark 1977; Loktev et al. 2022). Gravitationally lensed photons
that scatter o the disk (known as returning radiation) are polarized perpendicular to the direct thermal radiation
(Schnittman & Krolik 2009). Comptonization, commonly invoked to explain the power-law component, gives rise to a
polarization perpendicular to the spatial extent of the Comptonizing plasma (Poutanen & Svensson 1996; Schnittman &
Krolik 2010; Krawczynski & Beheshtipour 2022). The apparent alignment of the polarization directions of the thermal
and power-law emission could imply that the Comptonizing plasma of the SPL state is extended perpendicular to
the accretion disk|contrary to what we inferred for the hard state of Cyg X-1 (Krawczynski et al. 2022). However,
it is worth noting that for a slab corona geometry, polarization is parallel to the disk at photon energies where
the rst Compton scattering dominates the ux (Poutanen et al. 2023). Since the temperature of the disk is high
(kTbb1:5 keV), the rst scattering could dominate in the IXPE energy range such that the PA of the disk and the
up-scattered component are aligned.
Based on the IXPE results, we posit that the HSS and SPL states could exhibit similar disk geometries and
involve similar emission processes. In the scenario discussed in Paper I, an outowing, partially-ionized accretion
disk atmosphere produces the observed high PD as a result of Thomson scattering. The electrons in the outow
attain Compton temperature (a few keV) if ecient heating and acceleration mechanisms, such as shocks, magnetic
reconnection, and turbulence, do not operate. Instantaneous increase of electron heating and acceleration may lead
to a change of the scattering mechanism|from Thomson to inverse Compton|producing the observed power-law
component. During the transitions between the soft and hard states, the observed spectra are known to be well tted
with Comptonization from low-temperature thermal or hybrid (thermal and non-thermal) electrons (Gierli nski et al.
1999; Zdziarski et al. 2001; _Zycki et al. 2001), with a typical temperature of the Maxwellian part 10 keV. Increased
electron temperature, in general, causes the reduction of the PD (e.g., Fig. 2 of Poutanen 1994); however for these low
electron temperatures the eect is rather small and the polarization signatures remain similar to (albeit not exactly
the same as in) the Thomson-scattering case. The observed variations of the PD during the HSS and SPL states could
result from changes in the scattered fraction and/or the outow velocities.
As mentioned in Paper I and in West & Krawczynski (2023), non-vanishing accretion disk geometrical thicknesses
may play a role in explaining the high polarization fractions of the source. Spectral tting indicates that the disk
temperature kTbbincreased between the HSS (in Paper I) and the SPL state. This increase in temperature is expected
if a thicker accretion disk is present in the SPL state (Tomsick et al. 2005). As higher energy photons originate closer
to the black hole and are more likely to scatter, this scenario naturally explains PD increasing with photon energy.
In contrast, the reection o distant features (e.g. o a wind) would give rise to rather energy-independent PD. We
also note that the neutral hydrogen column density is much smaller in the SPL than in the HSS state. The similar
polarization properties of the emission from both states conrm our conclusion from Paper I that scattering o the
wind is most likely not the dominant mechanism explaining the high polarization of the X-ray emission.
On the other hand, we note that spectral timing studies of black hole LMXRBs suggest that their coronae contract
in the hard state and then expand during the hard-to-soft state transition (Wang et al. 2022). Soft reverberation lag
modeling employing a lamppost corona estimates that the corona height increases by an order of magnitude during
the state transition (Wang et al. 2021). If this increase in height were to be accompanied by a decrease in width, we
could expect a change in the shape of the corona from laterally extended in the LHS to vertically extended|and hence
giving rise to large reverberation lags|in the intermediate states. Our polarization results could then be explained
by a cone or lamppost-shaped corona in the SPL state. Future polarization measurements of the source, particularly
in the LHS, could help constrain the evolution of the corona geometry as well as the polarization of the power-law
component.
In other alternative scenarios, the power-law component could originate as synchrotron emission from a jet perpen-
dicular to the accretion disk threaded by a magnetic eld aligned with the jet; or from synchrotron emission from
non-thermal electrons accelerated in the plunging region, gyrating in a magnetic eld perpendicular to the accretion
disk (Hankla et al. 2022). This model would require just the right amount of magnetic eld non-uniformity to explain
the rather low PD of the power-law emission for synchrotron emission. Yan & Wang (2011) propose that the SPL
state originates from synchrotron radiation of magnetized compact spots near the ISCO, down-scattered by thermal
electrons in the corona. Also here, some ne-tuning is required so that the combined thermal and power-law emission
end up having similar polarization signatures as the thermal emission alone.10

A.DATA REDUCTION
IXPE (Weisskopf et al. 2022) observed 4U 1630{47 for 141 ksec between 2023 March 10 19:21:04 UTC and
2023 March 13 19:02:48 UTC under observation ID 02250601. The IXPE processed level-2 data was obtained from
the HEASARC archive. The data are publically available from the web-site https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ixpe/
archive/. The analysis of the IXPE data was performed using the ixpeobssim software version 28.4.0 (Baldini et al.
2022) based on the level-2 processed data. The source region was chosen in SAOImage DS9 software (Joye & Mandel
2003) as a circular area with a 6000radius centered at (16h34m03s:3, 472301600.8). We did not extract the background
due to possible contamination of source photons (Di Marco et al. 2023). The PD and PA were computed using the
PCUBE algorithm incorporated in ixpeobssim to calculate the polarization signature of the observation independent of
a model. Version 11 of the IXPE response functions were used to process the data.
NICER (Gendreau et al. 2012) is a soft X-ray spectral-timing instrument covering the 0.2{12 keV energy band.
NICER observed the source from 2023 March 10 18:09:24 UTC to March 13 19:35:58 UTC under observation IDs
6557010XXX (101,102,201,202,301,302) for a total of 32:81 ks of useful time among the 6 observations. The data
were reduced using nicerdas v10 software and the xti20221001 release of NICER CALDB products. The SCORPEON
background model was adopted. Observations were ltered for hot detectors, corrected for detector deadtime, and
screened to remove candidate good-time intervals with substantially elevated background or candidate intervals less
than 100 s long. In the paper we show the NICER spectra combined according to Period 1 or Period 2 of the IXPE
observation. We have used addspec tool from the heasoft package (Nasa High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive
Research Center (Heasarc) 2014) for this purpose.
The NuSTAR (Harrison et al. 2013) spacecraft observed the source under observation IDs 8090231300#(2,4,6) and
collected a total of 28:35 ks of net exposure. The data were processed with the NuSTARDAS software (version 2.1.2) of
theheasoft package (version 6.31.1). The source events were selected with a circular region of 6000radii centered at the
source coordinates (16h34m01s:6101, 472303400.806) for both focal plane modules (FPMA/FPMB). The background
region was selected as circular region with radius 91.600centered at (16h34m46s:6422, 472400300.752). The rst
observation was taken during the Period 1 with lower ux, while the other two observations correspond to the Period
2. We compared the spectra and combined the 2nd and 3rd spectra for each FPM using addspec fromftool to have
one representative spectra per FPM for the Period 2.
B.SPECTRAL FIT
In order to study the polarization properties of the thermal and Comptonized component we performed a joint t on
the NICER and NuSTAR spectra of the SPL state observation. Since our aim here is only to give an estimate of the
polarization degree and angle of the two spectral components, we performed our analysis on the two instruments' time-
averaged spectra, subdivided into two groups each, corresponding to Periods 1 and 2 of the SPL state IXPE observation.
Moreover, to further simplify our approach, we restricted our study to the 2{10 keV energy range for NICER data and
to the 8{70 keV range for NuSTAR ones in order to reduce cross-calibration uncertainties between the two instruments.
The choice to analyze NuSTAR data starting from 8 keV, in particular, belongs to the large inconsistencies between
the NICER and NuSTAR data below this energy|although some cross-calibration residuals can still be observed in
the 8{9 keV range. We used the NuSTAR spectra up to 70 keV since above that the background was comparable to
the data. A complete, time-resolved spectral analysis, as well as the study of the low energy inconsistencies between
NICER and NuSTAR data, is beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed in a future publication. We used
thexspec package (v12.13.0c) and employed the following model in the analysis:
edgeedgetbabs (kerrbb +nthcomp ): (B1)
The model comprises of thermal thin accretion disk emission accounting for relativistic eects ( kerrbb , Li et al. 2005),
thermally Comptonized continuum emission ( nthcomp , Zdziarski et al. 1996; _Zycki et al. 1999), and absorption by the
interstellar medium ( tbabs , Wilms et al. 2000). Following the approach from Paper I, we xed the distance of the
source in the kerrbb model to the value of D= 11:5 kpc; moreover, we kept the system inclination xed at the value
ofi= 75, leaving only the black hole spin, mass, and accretion rate free to vary in the tting procedure. A cloudy13
(Ferland et al. 2017) absorption table was used in Paper I to model the absorption lines detected in the observation
of the source in HSS, likely produced by a highly-ionized outowing plasma (i.e. with ionization parameter 105
and hydrogen column density NH1024cm 2). If we use the cloudy component and assume the same ionization
parameter of the HSS observation, it is possible to obtain an upper limit of NH1022cm 2on the wind column density
along the line of sight. However, if the ionization parameter is allowed to vary freely it is usually tted to unrealistically
high values. Additionally, the SPL state observation shows no prominent absorption lines so this component was no
longer used in the tting procedure. We used the nthcomp component assuming either disk blackbody or blackbody
seed radiation. For Fit 1, we assumed multicolor disk blackbody seed radiation (inp type parameter = 1) and xed
its temperature to the values obtained from initial modeling using diskbb (kTbb= 1:46+0:02
 0:01; 1:54+0:01
 0:02keV in Period
1 and 2, respectively). For Fit 2, we used a single blackbody as the input radiation (inp type parameter = 0) and
instead left the temperature free to vary in the tting procedure. The nthcomp input radiation modied the uxes
contributions, as presented in Table 1, and consequently the polarization properties of the power-law component. This
is due to the dierent low energy contributions of nthcomp when using a multicolor black body in place of a single
black body, which inuences the kerrbb accretion rate in the tting procedure and consequently the thermal radiation
contribution to the total ux. Figure 6 shows the unfolded spectra and data residuals for both ts. The Period 2
kerrbb contribution to the total ux in Fit 2 is signicantly larger than in Fit 1 as denoted by the dashed green lines.
Additionally, following Paper I, an empirical absorption edge model was used at 2 :42 and 9:51 keV to account
for reported instrumental features in the NICER and NuSTAR spectra, respectively (Wang et al. 2021; Podgorny
et al. 2023). The cross-calibration model MBPO employed in Krawczynski et al. (2022) was used to account for cross-
calibration uncertainties between NICER and NuSTAR allowing the spectral slope and normalization to vary. For
theNuSTAR focal plane module A (FPMA) we xed the normalization to 1 for all tting groups, corresponding to
the recommended value in Madsen et al. (2022) and kept the slope xed to zero. For the t presented in Table 2
we obtained the normalization values of 1 :0350:002 and 0:9940:001, and the slope values of 0 :06640:0033
and 0:00950:0025, for the NICER and NuSTAR FPMB observations, respectively. The best-t parameters of this
analysis are shown in Table 2 for a 2=dof = 2502 :68=2399, when using a disk blackbody input radiation for the
nthcomp component, and a 2=dof = 2470 :75=2399 assuming a blackbody input for the power-law component. It
is worth noting that in our simplied approach the data are consistently above the model in the high energy tail of
the spectra (45{70 keV) with both models further motivating the need for a more detailed analysis of the spectral
properties of this source.

As a following step, we included IXPE spectra in the tting procedure, dividing them into two groups corresponding
to the periods of the SPL state observation. We allowed all the parameters of the MBPO model to vary independently
for each of the three IXPE detector units in both periods. For the ts presented in Table 2, we found the   1values of
0:1180:033, 0:0730:032, 0:0990:019, the   2values of 0:270:11, 0:410:19, 0:770:31, theEbrvalues of

theIXPE DUs 1,2,3, respectively, in Period 1 of the SPL state. In Period 2, we obtained the following values for the
three IXPE DUs:   1= 0:0130:011;0:0750:018;0:0760:016;   2= 0:590:15; 0:4160:063;0:4580:097;

found that the best-tting model has a 2=dof = 3693:90=3293. The reduced 2is greater than one even accounting
for 1% systematic uncertainties for the NICER data sets, within the mission's recommendations2This result is likely
due to our simplied approach of performing a time-averaged analysis on a highly variable source.
