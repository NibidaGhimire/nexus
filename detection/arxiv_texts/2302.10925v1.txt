Abstract
Solar activities may disturb the geomagnetic ﬁeld and impac t the power grid via geomagnetically induced currents. We st udy active and
reactive powers as well as the power factor of Iran’s power gr id transformers (230 kV and 400 kV) and their correlations wi th geomagnetic
disturbances indices (SYM-H <-30 nT and sizable horizontal geomagnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuation) from 19 March 2018 to 20 March 2020. Out of
128,627 cases with a transformer power factor of less than 0. 7, we observe that 12,112 samples correlated with SYM-H. Our investigation shows
that about 4 percent of two years, the SYM-H has values less th an -30 nT. Analysis of high-performance transformers (a pow er factor greater than
0.7 at 95 percent of working time) shows at least a 55 percent c orrelation of power factor less than 0.7 and SYM-H less than - 30 nT. We observe
that the transformers’ power factor of Rafsanjan-Kerman an d Sarcheshmeh-Kerman (wye connection on 230 kV side) substa tions decreased to
less than 0.7 and correlated with SYM-H. We show that the reac tive power of the Seﬁdrood-Guilan and Shahid Beheshti-Guil an transformers
(wye conﬁgurations) increased considerably on 9 January 20 20 and positively correlated with SYM-H may produce large GI Cs at this part of the
grid. We observe that the increase in reactive power at the Sh ahid Beheshti-Guilan substation correlated with the sizab le changes in the horizontal
ﬁeld recorded by the Jaipur station. However, more details ( temperature and current of transformers) need records to es timate the impact of
geomagnetic induction current on the power grid.

Introduction
Geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) appear during interactio ns of the solar wind plasma or a coronal mass ejection (CME) wi th
the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. (Jonas & McCarron, 2015; Rozanov et al., 2016; Taran et al., 2019; Mate, 2019; Abda et al., 2020 ;
Strasburg, 2020; Shaikh & Badgujar, 2022). GMDs are the time -varying Earth magnetic ﬁelds that may generate an electric
ﬁeld via Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction (Pirjo la & Viljanen, 1991; Pirjola, 2007; Marshall et al., 2011). T he geo-
magnetically induced current (GIC) from an induced electri c ﬁeld on the Earth may a ﬀect the technological equipment (such as

power grid, telecommunication, and oil pipelines) and crea te problems in the standard course of their operation (Pirjo la, 2000;
Hejda & Bochní ˇcek, 2005; Ngwira et al., 2008; Oliveira & Ngwira, 2017; Abda et al., 2020).
Solar activity shows a main period of eleven-year and a varie ty of energetic phenomena (such as CME, ﬂares, and ﬂares
associated with CMEs) appear in the solar atmosphere. GMDs a re more likely correlated with high-energy solar phenomena
(Gruzdev & Brasseur, 2007; Aschwanden, 2011; Prokoph et al. , 2012). Historical evidence shows that large solar storms h ave also
occurred during the minimum activity. The lowest recorded s olar activity belongs to the Maunder minimum (1645 - 1715) (E ddy,
1976; Usoskin et al., 2015), at which time aurora as evidence of a geomagnetic storm occurrence was recorded at low latitu des such
as Japan and China (Isobe et al., 2019). Therefore, the event of a geomagnetic storm may occur every time, even from maximu m
to minimum solar activity.
The GIC ﬂow in the power grid is a complex process and more like ly depends on the network conﬁguration than the geographica l
latitudes (Zheng et al., 2013). Trivedi et al. (2007) contin uously measured the horizontal component of geomagnetic ﬁe ld changes
and by installing a ﬂuxgate directly under the power transmi ssion lines (TL) during a geomagnetic storm in November 2004 ,
recorded a GIC of about 15 A in the Brazilian power grid case st udy.
Watari (2015) used the geomagnetic and geoelectric ﬁelds to obtain an empirical equation for GIC estimating in past inte nse
geomagnetic storms in Japan. Although their results indica ted that low latitudes are not more a ﬀected by GIC, they emphasized
that the decline or acceptance of this result needs to study f or longer. Ebihara et al. (2021) used geoelectric disturban ces data that
occurred in India in 1859 to examine the condition of Japan’s power grid in confronting a storm similar to a Carrington-cl ass storm.
Applying the convolution theory they showed that the lowest amount of GIC that could ﬂow in such a situation in the Japanes e
power grid was an impressive amount of about 89 ±30 A. The shared latitude of Iran and Japan conﬁrms that the GI C ﬂowing in
Iran’s power grid is not far from expected. Gil et al. (2021) u sed electrical grid failure logs, geomagnetic storm index, and solar
activity data to study the geoelectric ﬁeld variations in Po land for 2010–2014. They showed that severe geomagnetic sto rms, which
may have a solar origin, increase the number of transmission line failures.
The disturbance storm time ( Dst) index is one of the most widely used features for classifyin g geomagnetic storms that provides
a measure of the intensity of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld decre ases caused by the ring current. Using the Dstindex, the GMD storms
are divided into weak (-50 nT <Dst<-30 nT), moderate (-100 nT <Dst<-50 nT), intense (-200 nT <Dst<-100 nT), and very
intense ( Dst<-200 nT) storms (Nikolaeva et al., 2011; Valdés-Abreu et al. , 2021). SYM-H is a similar index designed to measure
storm intensity and has a time resolution of one minute compa red to Dstwith a one-hour resolution (Wanliss & Showalter, 2006).
Diﬀerent magnetometer stations calculate SYM-H as the symmetr ic part of the horizontal component of the magnetic ﬁeld near
the equator (Wanliss & Showalter, 2006). Iyemori et al. (201 0) proposed the SYM-H is a suitable geomagnetic index for mid -
latitudes. The strength of the local magnetic ﬁeld is a pract ical parameter in studying geomagnetic disturbances. Sign iﬁcant sudden
changes in the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld are evidence of a major geomagnetic disturbance event in an area. The SuperM ag
service provides magnetic ﬁeld data in local geomagnetic co ordinate systems (north, east, down) (Gjerloev, 2012). Rog ers et al.
(2020) used SuperMag data to provide a global model for the ex treme ﬂuctuations of the geomagnetic ﬁeld.
Power grid transformers are one of the most impressive power grid equipment that GICs ﬂow through their neutral point and
may cause some damage in them (Molinski, 2002; Zhu & Overbye, 2015; Etemadi & Rezaei-Zare, 2014). When the GIC passes
through the transformer as a quasi-direct current (0.0001 H z to 0.1 Hz), it causes half-wave saturation of the transform er core and
increases its magnetizing current (Girgis & Vedante, 2012; Zhang & Wang, 2014). Due to GIC in the network, the voltage may
be distorted, and reactive power may increase in transforme rs (Chen et al., 2019; Rajput et al., 2021). The PSASP (power s ystemTaran etal/Advances in Space Research xx (2023) xxx-xxx 3
analysis synthesis program) simulation revealed a linear r elationship between the reactive power losses of the transf ormer and the
GIC (Berge, 2011; Kang et al., 2019). Investigating the GIC o n 400 kV transformers in Finland showed no complete correlat ion
between the various substations’ GIC ﬂows. So estimating th e signiﬁcant GICs consequences on the Finnish power system i s
complicated (Lahtinen & Elovaara, 2002).
Shetye et al. (2013) studied the impact of GMD on American Ele ctric Power and determined the transformers with a high
probability of eﬀectiveness under di ﬀerent electric ﬁelds. They used the PowerWorld Simulator to calculate the reactive power
increases related to the GICs. The lowest electric ﬁeld esti mated for transformer voltage collapse was 13 V /km. Similar studies on
the power grid of the North American Eastern Interconnect ha ve also conﬁrmed the increase of reactive power in the presen ce of GIC
ﬂow (Overbye et al., 2013). A study on Siberia’s power grid pr ovided a graphical visualization of the electric grid’s vul nerability to
severe geomagnetic disturbances. Based on the topology of t he power grid, voltage level, length of transmission lines, and ground
conductivity, Sokolova et al. (2018) presented an algorith m that estimates the GIC ﬂow in the network.
Evaluation of geomagnetic induction current on 275 kV power transformers in Malaysia also showed that GICs ﬂowing in the
power system leads to half-cycle saturation of the transfor mer that may result in reactive power losses and voltage inst ability of the
power grid. Simulation of transformers’ active and reactiv e power response to GIC ﬂow showed that the magnitude of activ e power
decreases and the reactive power increases (Zawawi et al., 2 020). This study conﬁrmed the GIC event is not limited to high and
mid-latitudes and extends to power systems in low-latitude regions.
Albert et al. (2022) analyzed the long-term GIC measurement s in transformers for ﬁve years in Austria’s power grid. Usin g
frequency analysis, they found artiﬁcial sources of low-fr equency currents and frequent geomagnetic activities in di ﬀerent places.
The maximum current measured during the ﬁve years was 13.83 A , which occurred on 12 May 2021, concurrent with a geomagneti c
storm with a minimum Dstof -61 nT. The correlation between the magnetic ﬁeld and tran sformer neutral point currents variation
during high geomagnetic activity showed that GIC ﬂow is sens itive to speciﬁc locations and directions of magnetic ﬁeld c hange.
Here, we investigate Iran’s transformers’ active and react ive powers (230 and 400 kV) and correlations with the geomagn etic
ﬁelds. We use the geomagnetic ﬁelds such as the SYM-H index, a nd SuperMag magnetic ﬁeld data recorded close to Iran. We
study the eﬀect of geomagnetic storms on Iran’s power grid as a sample of a mid-latitude country.
Eﬀects of GIC on transformers
For a transformer with a wye connection and a grounded neutra l point, the GIC can ﬂow in the windings of the transformer.
So, we focus on analyzing transformers’ connections togeth er and with the ground to identify the possibility of causing GIC in the
network. The magnetic ﬂux ﬂows through the transformer core in one speciﬁc direction by exposing a DC on a power transform er.
The magnetic ﬂux density for a transformer depends on severa l factors such as the DC value, the number of turns per winding s,
and the reluctance of the path of the DC ﬂux (Kohli et al., 2018 ). Due to the presence of DC magnetic ﬂux in a transformer (Fig ure
1), the AC ﬂux increases from the expected value that is desig ned to be less than the knee point of the B-H curve of core (nomi nal)
value in the one-half cycle and decreases in the next half cyc le (Sharma, 2018). A su ﬃciently large DC or high ﬂux density may
cause the core ﬂux increases in the magnetic saturation doma in in half of one cycle.
Figure 2 shows the magnetic ﬂux density ( B) variation in terms of the magnetization current ( I) for the core material of a
transformer. As shown in the ﬁgure, we observe a nonlinear be havior for Ias a function of B. The nonlinear characteristic of the
transformer core material causes a magnetization current i ncrease as the transformer core approaches saturation. The transformer
is designed to operate below saturation under standard cond itions/nominal voltage.4 Taran etal/Advances in Space Research xx (2023) xxx-xxx

On the other hand, increasing the magnetizing current in the winding increases the reactive power of a transformer (Pric e, 2002;
Wang et al., 2021b). As stated above, the DC ﬂux density varia tion in the core depends on the magnetic reluctance of the DC ﬂ ux
path.
Therefore, DC ﬂux changes in the cores of three-phase and thr ee-limb transformers are less than in other types because th eir
design creates a higher magnetic reluctance to ﬂow DC in the c ore. The core material, type of connection, and kind of core h ave

Data and Analysis
Longitudinally symmetric disturbance index
The symmetric disturbance ﬁeld in the horizontal direction (SYM-H) has a similar physical unit of Dst. SYM-H is observed by
several stations such as San Juan ( 18.11◦N), Alibag (18.638◦N), Honolulu (21.32◦N), Tucson (32.17◦N), Fredericksburg (38.2◦
N), Boulder (40.13◦N), Urumqi (43.8◦N), Memambetsu (43.91◦N), Chambon-la-Foret (48.025◦N), Martin de Vivies (37.796◦S),
and Hermanus (34.425◦S). The SYM-H index provides geomagnetic ﬁeld disturbance ( in nT unit) in mid-latitudes with 1-minute
resolution and is accessible at https://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ (Iyemori et al., 2010; Wawrzaszek et al., 2022).

Power grid data
Power grid data includes the active and reactive powers (the units are in MW and Mvar, respectively) of the transmission
transformers taken from Iran Electricity Management Compa ny, which is performed in two voltage classes, 230 kV (522 cas es)
and 400 kV (197 cases). Iran’s power grid data (including act ive and reactive powers for transformers) is available with one hour
resolution from 19 March 2018 to 20 March 2020. To reduce the e rror, we consider the average active ( PA) and reactive ( PR) power
of transformers for each substation. The power factor is deﬁ ned as the ratio of active power to apparent power,

Some power grid equipment, such as capacitors or SVC, etc., c ompensate for the power grid’s di ﬀerent parts for a power factor
between 0.9 and 0.95. A decrease in the power factor of around 0.85 indicates the non-optimal use of the capacity of the gri d’s
equipment and the lack of enough compensation.
Figure 3 shows the time series of power factors for two 400 kV t ransformers. In the ﬁrst case (Figure 3 top), the power facto r is
in the range of 0.7 to 1 for a transformer as a part of a network w ithout the neutral points. But, in the second case (Figure 3 b ottom),
we indicate the power factor for a transformer with neutral p oints in the network, which shows the power factor is mostly b elow6 Taran etal/Advances in Space Research xx (2023) xxx-xxx

transformers is similar to the ﬁrst case, in that most of the p ower factors vary above 0.7.

Reducing the power factor to less than 0.7 or increasing the r eactive power compared to a normal situation depends on seve ral
factors in the network structure or external factors. In syn chronizing it with a geomagnetic storm, the GIC may be one of t he
eﬀective candidates for the power values perturbation. The GI C enters the power grid from the neutral point of the transfor mers
and ﬂows in the transmission lines. To this end, we investiga te the correlations of the SYM-H index reduction to less than -30 nT
and the lack of optimal power distribution (power factor les s than 0.7) in the electric power network.
Figure 4 illustrates the algorithm for estimating the GIC in the power network. First, for the power grid data correlated with the
SYM-H<-30 nT, we calculate the power factor for two classes of 230 an d 400 kV transformers (Steps 1 and 2). If the value of
the power factor is less than 0.7 in 50 percent of the given tim e, we consider this transformer as one of the potential trans formers
aﬀected by GIC (Steps 3 and 4). In the next step, if the power fact or reduction to less than 0.7 continues for 10 hours, the tran sformer
remains on the list of a ﬀected ones (Step 5). However, it is necessary to check the amo unt of active and reactive power during this
period. If the reactive power increases compared to the norm al state and the active power decreases or remain constant, t he GICs in
this transformer can be conﬁrmed with a high probability (St ep 6).Taran etal/Advances in Space Research xx (2023) xxx-xxx 7  ✁ ✂ ✄ ☎ ✆ ✝ ✞ ✟ ✠ ✄ ✡ ☛ ✠ ☞✟ ✌ ✍ ✌ ✁ ✎ ✎ ✝ ✆ ✝ ☞✁ ✆ ✏   

Results
For March 2018 to March 2020, we detect 128,627 cases (with a p ower factor less than 0.7) for Iran’s power network, of which
12,112 correlate with GMD for SYM-H <-30 nT (ﬂowchart of Figure 4). Gil et al. (2021) showed that ou t of 25,616 and 30,155
registered failures of the electrical grids in southern Pol and, 4625 and 10,656 failures might relate to GMD in 2010 and 2 014,
respectively. The total number of failures near the solar ma ximum (January–July 2014) is twice that of the solar minimum (2010).
Therefore, their results conﬁrm the positive correlation b etween the number of electrical grid failures and solar acti vity.
Figure 5 shows the number of Iran substations (with a power fa ctor less than 0.7) and the time series of the SYM-H <-30 nT
at every time. We eliminate the statistics of the turn-o ﬀsubstations with zero active and reactive powers. The power factor and
SYM-H cadences (resolutions) are 1 hour and 1 minute, respec tively. We ﬁnd that only at 4 percent of times within two years , the
SYM-H has values less than -30 nT. To determine the possible i mpact of geomagnetic activity on the power network, we consi der
the time interval of ten hours (ﬂowchart of Figure 4) after ea ch SYM-H with value <−30 nT. We select transformers with a power8 Taran etal/Advances in Space Research xx (2023) xxx-xxx
factor less than 0.7 at less than 5 percent of analyzing perio d. In other words, these transformers deliver high performa nce (power
factor>0.7) at 95 percent of working times. We observe that these tra nsformers with a power factor less than 0.7 show at least a 55
percent correlation (moderate) with SYM-H <-30 nT. This ﬁnding may indicate the GIC in the power network d ue to disturbance
of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, which needs to conﬁrm by instal ling the appropriate instrument in Iran’s power grid substa tions.
Zhang et al. (2020) applied the SYM-H index in analyzing the G ICs measurement at China’s low-latitude power grid substat ions
and found a positive correlation between the large GIC and co nsiderable change in the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld.

Following the algorithm in Figure 4, we extracted the power f actor of less than 0.7 for two classes of 230 and 400 kV transfo rm-
ers. Then we considered their correlations with SYM-H <-30 nT (time interval less than ten hours). Figure 6 represen ts the color

For more accurate analysis, we eliminate the time interval w hen oscillating changes in power factor accompany the lack o f
optimal power distribution in the network. Figure 7 shows a s ample of oscillating power factor changes for a 230 kV transf ormer.
By visual inspection, we select non-oscillatory perturbat ions (power factor less than 0.7) correlated with SYM-H <-30 nT. Our in-
vestigations show that 89 and 84 cases of disturbances may or iginate from geomagnetic storms in 400 kV and 230 kV transfor mers,
respectively.
Synchronization and connection between the transformers’ perturbations can be two important characteristics of incr easing their
correlation with geomagnetic storms. Forty-one times, the se perturbations appear in at least two transformers. Figur e 8 presents
the time series of the SYM-H index (upper panel) and the power factor of Manoujan (KMAN) (middle panel) and Navard (NNA V)

decreased to less than 0.7 at the same time (11 May 2018).

Decreases in the power factor to less than 0.7 is due to increa sing the reactive power and reducing (or remaining constant ) the
active power to lower values. A considerable decreasing pow er factor may be considered as evidence for GICs in the transf ormers.
By visual inspection, we ﬁnd the reactive power peaks above o ptimal values correlated with SYM-H <-30 nT. Our investigation
shows that a geomagnetic storm may cause 40 and 44 cases in 400 kV and 230 kV transformers, respectively. In 21 cases, these
highly appear in at least two transformers. Figure 11 presen ts the time series of SYM-H index (upper panel) moreover, act ive and

remains constant, but the reactive power is signiﬁcantly in creased and correlated with SYM-H (7 May 2018).
By analyzing the solar event catalog ( https://www.sidc.be/cactus/catalog.php ), we ﬁnd a set of coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) appeared on 3 May 2018 and 9 May 2018, which may have cau sed the GMDs. Typically, due to the velocity and angular
width of a CME, it may reach the Earth’s environment within a f ew days and then a ﬀect the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. Quantitative
analysis of solar energetic particles detected by near the E arth instruments (GOES, ACE, etc.) may identify their solar event sources
(e.g., Mohammadi et al., 2021).10 Taran etal/Advances in Space Research xx (2023) xxx-xxx

Wang et al. (2021a) suggested a simulation method to recogni ze the critical substations of the China power grid a ﬀected by GIC.
Their study provides monitoring to control the damage to the China power network. A similar simulation of Iran’s power gr id
structure needs to be employed for identifying the critical substations that may be a ﬀected by GIC.
The connection of two substations, a decrease in substation s’ active power, and an increase in reactive power during the geomag-
netic storm are essential factors to verify the GIC in the net work. These factors may conﬁrm the correlation with the stor m. Figure
12 presents the time series of the SYM-H index (upper panel) a nd transformers power factor of Seﬁdrood (GSEF) (middle pan el)
and Shahid-Beheshti (GBEH) (bottom panel) substations wit h common transmission lines. Figure 13 presents the geograp hical
location of the Seﬁdrood-Shahid-Beheshti transmission li ne. The transmission line length of the two stations is 14 km, located in
the east-west direction. The end of the connecting lines of t wo substation transformers are wye conﬁguration and have a n eutral
point for GIC ﬂow.
The horizontal geomagnetic ﬁeld variation recorded by the l ocal magnetic observatories is an essential indication of a magnetic
storm. The lack of such information was due to the lack of well organized local magnetic ﬁeld observatories in Iran, so we u sed
the data from JAI as one of the nearest observatories. Figure 14 shows a sample of time series of horizontal geomagnetic ﬁe ld
variation observed by JAI (26.92◦N, 75.8◦E) and transformers power factor of Shahid-Beheshti (GBEH) substation. A sizeable
geomagnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuation correlates with increasing re active power and decreasing active power in Shahid-Behesht i (GBEH)
substation. The horizontal geomagnetic ﬁeld variations ma y aﬀect the power network and probably lead to the GIC (Dods et al. ,
2015; Rogers et al., 2020).
We observe that some reactive power correlated with SYM-H, b ut others did not respond to SYM-H. This inconsistency may be
due to the characteristics of SYM-H as a global index for GMDs . Therefore, a complete correlation between reactive power s and
SYM-H could not be expected. Some reactive powers are well co rrelated with the local magnetic ﬁeld measurements, which s hows
the necessity of ground base observatories to record the loc al magnetic ﬁeld variation.Taran etal/Advances in Space Research xx (2023) xxx-xxx 11
1. Conclusions
GICs ﬂowing in the power systems is one of the GMD e ﬀects as a space weather indicator which can cause saturation of power
transformers. The SYM-H index is one of the most appropriate parameters to investigate the e ﬀect of geomagnetic storms. In
this article, by analyzing the powers of transformers, we ex amined the evidence of GIC ﬂux in the network. In data process ing,
according to the algorithm in Figure 4, we considered each su bstation as a node in the network. We used the average power va lue
of all transformers in a substation for data analysis.
Our investigation covering the period from 19 March 2018 to 2 0 March 2020 shows that Iran’s power network, a mid-latitude
system, experienced a total of 128,627 cases (with a power fa ctor less than 0.7), out of which 12,112 samples were likely d ue to
GMDs. These results may imply the presence of GIC in the Iran p ower network due to GMDs. Our analysis for high-performance
transformers (with a power factor greater than 0.7) showed t hat the lack of optimal distribution in 55 percent correlate s well with
SYM-H values less than -30 nT.
In the local magnetic ﬁeld data analysis, we found that consi derable changes in the horizontal ﬁeld signiﬁcantly correl ate with
an increase in the reactive power at the GBEH substation. Alt hough there are no proper installations to measure the GICs i n Iran’s
power grid, two sample substations show probable evidence o f GIC in the network due to geomagnetic storms. The ﬁrst event
appeared from the Rafsanjan to Sarcheshmeh substations (wi th wye conﬁgurations) with a 56 km transmission line length c orrelated
with a moderate geomagnetic storm (SYM-H =-31 nT). The second event from the Seﬁdrood to Shahid-Behesh ti substations (with
wye conﬁgurations) and 14 km transmission line length coinc ided with a geomagnetic storm of moderate intensity (SYM-H =-34
nT).
We studied the active power, reactive power, and power facto r of Iran’s power network within two years of the minimum sola r
activities, which indicates the e ﬀect of geomagnetic storms in the network. For proper investi gation of the eﬀects of GMDs on Iran’s
power grid, we require long-term studies and some more trans former parameters such as voltage, current, and temperatur e with
tiny time intervals. The long-term studies were done in Braz il and Japan as the middle latitude countries a ﬀected by a geomagnetic
storm (Trivedi et al., 2007; Watari, 2015).
Many studies (e.g., Kirkham et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013; So kolova et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Zhang & Liu, 2020; Albe rt et al.,
2022) show that countries that have developed the space weat her monitoring infrastructure to predict and recognize GMD events
may prevent damage to their electric-based instruments. De veloping solar and space weather monitoring centers helps t o predict
and protect against the e ﬀects of geomagnetic disturbances in middle-east countries that are on the road to development and space
investigations.12 Taran etal/Advances in Space Research xx (2023) xxx-xxx
