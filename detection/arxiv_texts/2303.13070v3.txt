1 Introduction
The validation of the Standard Model (SM) and exploration of Beyond Standard Model (BSM)
physicsareconsideredtobeaparamountmissioninparticlephysics. RecentresultsfromtheLHCb
[1],BaBar[2],andBelle[3](Sec. 7.6in[4])demonstratehintsofpossibleviolationoftheLepton
Universality(LU)in 𝐵mesondecays. ThestudyofLUinneutrinointeractionscanbeanewprobe
forBSM.However,thedataon 𝜈𝜏isquitescarce;onlyafewexperimentshavereporteditsdetection.
The DONuT experiment [5] directly detected 𝜈𝜏for the first time and estimated the 𝜈𝜏interaction
cross-section[6]. However,thecross-sectionmeasurementhadabout30%statisticserrorduetothe
lowstatisticsandabout50%systematicerrorduetoapoorlyconstrained 𝜈𝜏flux. Themainsource
of𝜈𝜏is the leptonic decay of 𝐷𝑠mesons. Therefore, a precise measurement of the 𝐷𝑠production
cross-section can provide prediction of 𝜈𝜏fluxes for neutrino experiments like FASER( 𝜈) [7, 8],
SND@LHC[9]andfutureexperimentsproposedatCERNBDF[10]. TheNA65/DsTauexperiment
[11, 12] at CERN-SPS was proposed to measure 𝐷𝑠production cross-section in proton-nucleus
interactions by detecting about 103𝐷𝑠→𝜏→𝑋decays. This measurement is going to reduce
uncertainty in the DONuT’s measurement from 50% to 10%.
Theidentificationof 𝐷𝑠→𝜏→𝑋decayswillbeperformedbyusingtopologicalinformation,
thanks to the high spatial and angular resolution of the emulsion-based detectors [13].
The detector modules are exposed to the CERN SPS 400 GeV proton beam with an intensity
order of 105per spill with a duration of about 4 seconds. The emulsion accumulates the trajectory
of charged particles passing through, however, there is a limit of the track density which can be
successfully processed and analyzed. As the proton beam spot is small, the target mover (TM)
system (as shown in Figure 1) is utilized to uniformly irradiate the whole surface of the emulsion
detectors. The similar movable stages were used in the past experiments [14–16]. The small scale
TMprototypewasusedduringthetestrunsin2016and2017theninthepilotrunof2018[11]. As
the detector modules used for 2021 physics run were four times larger than those used in the test
and pilot runs, the payload and moving range of the TM should be > 20 kgand > 350 cm×350 cm,
respectively. Thus, a new TM with a wide aperture was developed by modifying the TM used

This paper reports on the development of the new TM and control system, and evaluates their
performance in the 2021 physics run.
2 The Target Mover and the real-time speed control system
The TM is a motorized 2-dimensional stage to raster-scan the emulsion module with respect to the
beam. Thesteppingmotorsdrivethestageunderthecontrolofacomputerwithaprogramwritten
inC#language. Steppingmotorsoffermoreprecisecontroloverstagepositionandspeedcompared
to the DC motors that were used to control the TM in previous experiments [14, 15]. We have
implemented additional mechanical support to hold the emulsion modules. The schematic view of
the experimental setup is shown in Figure 2. The cross delayed wire chamber (XDWC) measures
theprotonbeamprofile. ThehitefficiencyofXDWCweusedwastoolow, <20%,tobeusedasthe
proton counter. Therefore, two scintillation counters to obtain proton counts were located behind
the TM. Coincidence were taken in order to minimize the contamination from backgrounds. The
trigger threshold of them was set to well below the MIP level. As shown in Figure 3, signals from
the scintillation counters are sent to a series of NIM modules (discriminator, coincidence module,
pre-scaler, and NIM-TTL converter). The coincidence signal is then transferred to a Raspberry Pi
4B microcomputer. The Raspberry Pi counts the pulses and sends the data to the TM control PC
every100 ms. ATCP-IPprotocolisusedforthecommunicationbetweentheRaspberryPiandthe
TM control PC. The TM control PC calculates the optimal stage speed 𝑣𝑥based on the following
formulas:

oftheraster-scanning,whichdependsonthebeamprofileasdiscussedinSection4. Figure4shows
the flowchart of this system which is called the real-time speed control system (RSCS).
At the beginning, the stage moves to the start position. When the beam is exposed on the
module,thestagemovesin 𝑥directionfor330 mmatthespeedcontrolledbytheRSCS,thenmoves
in𝑦directionby𝑦-stepataconstantspeedof 5 mm/s. Thenthestagemovesagainalong 𝑥axis,but
intheoppositedirection. TheTMrepeatsthesestepstoexposetheentiresurfaceofthemodule. We
avoided scanning in y direction because the detector module is so heavy and may affect the RSCS
performance. After the module irradiation is completed, the stage goes back to the start position.
In the event of any trouble, the operator could immediately stop the TM and return it to the start
positionwherethedetectorwouldnotbeexposedtothebeam. Oncetheissueisresolved,theraster
scan could be restarted from where it is interrupted.
Therequirementontheprotondensityis 105cm−2withlessthan10%fluctuation. Thiswould
cause 1% systematic uncertainty in 𝐷0detection due to fluctuation of misidentified 𝐾0. To be
precise, we seeking for 𝐷0by searching for neutral decay around proton interaction vertex. Since
emulsions does not have time information, neutral decay (e.g. 𝐾0) from other proton interaction
can be in the region of interest, being the background to 𝐷0. In order to estimate the background
ratio, we will compare the data with the MC simulation with the uniform proton density. This is
the level of uncertainties that we can tolerate for this analysis.

thestagespeed. Such"Notreasonable"countsaremainlycausedbybiterrorsinthedatatransmission. This
was observed at the development stage, but not in the physics run.
3 Testing and commissioning of the TM
TheRSCSperformancewasevaluatedusing90Sr𝛽sourceinChibaUniversity. Aleadbrickwitha
weightof22.7kgwasmountedontheTMinsteadoftheemulsionmodule,anda2 kBq90Srsource
wasusedtoemulatetheSPSbeam. Sinceelectronsfromthesourcedidnotpenetratethroughboth
scintillators,thecountratewastoolow. Therefore,weemployedonlyonescintillationcounterand
omit the prescaler. Figure 5 shows an example of the emulated beam spills using the90Srsource.
The pseudo beam spills were emulated by placing the source on the scintillation counter for 2.5
seconds by hand, this was repeated about 950 times.
The speed of the TM stage was optimized using data of the 2018 pilot run at the SPS and
calculated by Equation 2.1. In order to emulate the stage velocity similar to one of the real
experiments, the required pseudo beam density and 𝑦-step size of raster-scanning were set to
1500 cm−2and12 mm, respectively.
To emulate the proton density map, the recorded stage position and source intensity were
smeared by weighting each signal by a 2D Gaussian, with a sigma of 10 mm. Figure 6 shows the
calculateddensitymapanddistributionofthedensityineach1 cm2. Thedensitywasmeasuredas
(1550±61)cm−2. The achieved uniformity is approximately 4%, which satisfies the requirement
of the experiment ( <10%).

4 Physics run at the CERN SPS H2 beamline
The NA65/DsTau 2021 physics run was performed at the CERN SPS H2 beamline from 23rdof
September to 7thof October in 2021.
AsshowninFigure7,allcomponentswereimplementedattheCERNSPSH2beamline. The
RaspberryPioftheRSCSwasoperatedfromthecontrolroom,outsideofthebeamarea. Thecount
data from the Raspberry Pi was transmitted to the TM control PC via Ethernet. The ping value of
theircommunicationwaslessthan 1 msec,theminimumvaluedetectablebytheWindowsOS.This
network delay is significantly shorter than 100 ms, tha data transfer cycle, and negligible for the
RSCSperformance. Thebeamenergywas 400 GeV,withanintensityof 5×105particlesperspill
of about 4 seconds. The beam intensity had a time structure as shown in Figure 8, and as the peak
showsthatthedatatakingratewasuptoabout 200 kHz. ThebeamprofilemeasuredbytheXDWC
demonstrated RMS values of 12 mmin𝑥direction and 13 mmin𝑦. We assumed that the position
profilewouldnotchangeduringtheirradiation. Andtheoperatorsperiodicallymonitoredthebeam
profilesandthemotionoftheTM,andnosignificantdeviationofprofileswasobserved,exceptfor
occasional accelerator failures. Figure 9 shows a measured beam profile in 𝑦(vertical) direction.
In order to find an optimal 𝑦-step value, the profile was multiple-copied and superimposed with
different𝑦-steps as shown in Figure 10. The step size was determined to be 15 mmto flatten the
overall proton density distribution.

Figure 8. Example of the time profile of the beam. In certain spills, we observed that the extracted beam
from the accelerator was not very uniform in the time domain, due to quadruple ripples or other effects that
fromtime-to-timeaffecttheslowextractiontowardstheNorthAreaandtheH2beamline. However,thiswas
compensated and was not problematic for the data taking.
The TM was successfully operated during the 2021 run for 17 detector modules with the size
of25 cm×20 cm×7 cm. Figure11describestheTMsequenceforoneofthemodulesinthe2021
run. Togetherwiththedatacollectedinthe2018pilotrun,approximately30%ofthetotalamount
of the proton interactions, planned to be registered in the experiment, were accumulated.
After the data taking in H2, the irradiated emulsion modules were dismantled, then the films
were developed chemically at the CERN nuclear emulsion facility. These developed films were
transported to Nagoya University and scanned by the HTS [18], the high-speed automatic micro-
scope. Toanalyzethedensityofregisteredprimaryprotons,thetrackswerereconstructedinthe10

5 Summary
The NA65/DsTau experiment aims to study tau neutrino production by detecting 𝐷𝑠→𝜏→𝑋
events with the emulsion based detector. The proton distribution on the detector surface should be
uniform with the density of 105cm−2. For physics analysis, the proton density fluctuation should
be<10%and the data taking rate should be O(105)Hz. With the help of the new TM and the
RSCS,fluctuation <10%inthepseudoprotondensitywasachievedinthecommissioningrunwith
the radioactive source. During the DsTau physics run in 2021 at the CERN-SPS H2 beamline, the
TM andthe RSCS workedsuccessfully and allowedthe data takingrate of 200 kHzand theproton
