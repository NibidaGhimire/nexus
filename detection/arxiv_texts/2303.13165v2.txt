I Introduction
Hamiltonian dynamical systems play an important role both in physics
and mathematics. In the literature one encounters many examples which are
interesting due to their relevance to physics and/or intriguing math ematical
properties. It happens quite often that the systems deﬁned by d iﬀerent

1Hamiltonians share the same unparameterized trajectories in phas e space.
They are, however, related in rather nontrivial way since the relev ant time
reparameterization varies, in general, from trajectory to traje ctory, i.e. is a
function of canonical variables. The Hamiltonians sharing unparame terized
phase space trajectories admit the same set of integrals of motion which do
not depend explicitly on time. This implies that they are to the same ext ent
integrable. In particular, they are (or not) simultaneously (super )integrable.
The classical example of such systems is provided by Darboux theor em [1],
[2]. Other very interesting examples have been constructed by the related
methodproposedbyHietarintaet.al. [3]underthenameofcoupling- constant
metamorphosis. It allowed, for example, to relate the Henon-Heiles [4] and
Holt [5, 6] Hamiltonians.
In the present paper we propose a fairly general method of const ructing,
starting from a given Hamiltonian, a whole family of related Hamiltonians
sharing the same set of unparameterized phase space trajector ies. It pro-
vides also an explicit relation between the Poisson algebras of integra ls of
motion. One can say that our approach yields a complete description of the
symmetry structure of the resulting Hamiltonians provided the sym metry
of the initial one is known. In general, the ﬁnal Hamiltonian doesn’t ha ve
the standard form even though we start with the standard one (i.e . a sum
of a non-degenerate quadratic form in momenta plus a function of g eneral-
ized coordinates only). However, in many cases one obtains the Ham iltonian
corresponding to the metric in conﬁguration space conformally equ ivalent to
that of the initial Hamiltonian. The method proposed generalizes the Dar-
boux and Hietarinta et al. approaches as well as it allows to describe a nd
generalizemanyexamplesofdynamicalsystemsencounteredinthe literature.
In particular it provides an interesting relationship between nonrela tivistic
and relativistic dynamics.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the general formalism is
presented while Sec. III is devoted to some examples discussed rec ently in
the literature [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. We consider oscillator- an d Kepler-
related systems as well as Henon-Heiles-like systems on curved con ﬁguration
space which, as far as we can see, haven’t been discussed previous ly (see,
however [15]). The relativistic-nonrelativistic correspondence is de scribed
in Sec. IV. Darboux and Hietarinta approaches are considered in Se c. V.
Finally, Sec. VI is devoted to some conclusions.
2II General scheme
Assume we have a Hamiltonian system deﬁned in 2N-dimensional phase
space. The relevant Hamiltonian reads:
H=H(q,p,λ) (1)
whereq≡(q1,...,qN),p≡(p1,...,pN) are canonical variables while λ≡
(λ1,...,λM) - the set of parameters (masses, coupling constants, frequen cies
etc.) characterizing our system. One deﬁnes the new Hamiltonian ˜H(q,p) as
follows. Let ˜Hbe a new variable; replace the parameters λαby the functions
λα=λα(˜H). (2)
Assume that they are chosen in such a way that the equation
˜H(q,p) =H(q,p,λ(˜H(q,p)) (3)
has the unique solution ˜H(q,p). In particular,
Ω(q,p)≡1−∂H
∂λα∂λα
∂˜H/ne}ationslash= 0 (4)
˜H(q,p) deﬁnes new dynamics on our phase space. Obviously, we may as-
sume that the functions λα, eq. (2), still depend on some parameters,
λα=λα(˜H,µ). Both Hamiltonian dynamics, generated by Hand˜H, are
closely related. One ﬁnds:
∂H
∂qi= Ω(q,p)∂˜H
∂qi
∂H
∂pi= Ω(q,p)∂˜H
∂pi(5)
Therefore,
3dqi
dt=∂H
∂pi= Ω(q,p)∂˜H
∂pi= Ω(q,p)dqi
d˜t
dpi
dt=−∂H
∂qi=−Ω(q,p)∂˜H
∂qi= Ω(q,p)dpi
d˜t;(6)
heret/parenleftbig˜t/parenrightbig
is the time parameter for the dynamics generated by H(˜H). Let
q=˜ q/parenleftbig˜t/parenrightbig
,p=˜ p/parenleftbig˜t/parenrightbig
be any particular solution to the Hamiltonian equations
for˜H, corresponding to some initial data (in particular, energy ˜E). Then
Ω becomes a function of time ˜tonly, Ω = Ω( ˜t). Let us relate tto˜tby the
equation
d˜t
dt= Ω. (7)
By comparing eqs. (6) and (7) we conclude that
qi= ˜qi(˜t(t))
pi= ˜pi(˜t(t)), i= 1,2,...,N(8)
are the solutions to the Hamiltonian equations for the Hamiltonian
H=H(q,p,λ(˜E)) (9)
Obviously, this works in the reverse direction as well.
It follows then that the set of all trajectories in phase space gene rated
by˜H(q,p) coincides with that for H(q,p,λ(˜E)); they diﬀer only by time
parameterization(thisdiﬀerencevariesfromtrajectorytotraj ectory). There-
fore, the (super)integrability of Himplies the (super)integrability of ˜Hand
reverse.
One can easily relate the algebras of integrals of motion for both dyn am-
ical systems. For any function on phase space,
F≡F(q,p;λ) (10)
4deﬁne
˜F≡F(q,p;λ(˜H(q,p))). (11)
Then
∂˜F
∂qi=∂F
∂qi+∂F
∂λα∂λα
∂˜H∂˜H
∂qi
∂˜F
∂pi=∂F
∂pi+∂F
∂λα∂λα
∂˜H∂˜H
∂pi.(12)
In particular, let
C=C(q,p,λ) (13)
be any integral of motion of the dynamics generated by H. Then one easily
ﬁnds
{˜C,˜H}= 0 (14)
implying that ˜Cis also an integral of motion; this follows also directly from
the coincidence of trajectories for both Hamiltonians.
Moreover, for any two integrals of motion we have
{˜Ca,˜Cb}=/tildewider{Ca,Cb} (15)
If{Ca}is the set of all functionally independent integrals of motion for H,
then
{Ca,Cb}=Fab(C,λ) (16)
withFa,bbeing some functions. Equations (15) implies
{˜Ca,˜Cb}=Fab(˜C,˜λ(˜H)) (17)
5Concluding, the algebras of symmetries for both systems are close ly related.
Finally, let us consider a particular form of the transformation discu ssed
above. We start with the Hamiltonian (1), assuming, for simplicity (bu t
without loosinggenerality) that thereisoneparameter λ. Obviously, nothing
will change if we start with the Hamiltonian
H′=H(q,p,λ)+d (18)
withdbeing an arbitrary constant. We make again the replacement λ→
λ(˜H) together with d→˜H−done. Then eq. (3) takes the form
0 =H(q,p,λ(˜H))−d (19)
Assuming that it can be solved with respect to ˜Hone ﬁnds
˜H=˜H(q,p,d) (20)
Obviously, our previous reasoning is still validincluding that concernin g inte-
gralsofmotionandtheiralgebra. Weconcludethatthetrajectorie sdescribed
by the initial Hamiltonian Hwith the coupling λ(˜E), corresponding to the
energyE=dcoincide (up to the reparameterization) with those described
by the Hamiltonian ˜Hwith the coupling d=Eand energy ˜E. This is the
generalized version of the so called coupling-constant metamorpho sis method
(see Sec. IV).
III Examples
III.1 Oscillator-related systems
Consider the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator
H=1
2/parenleftbig
/vector p2+ω2/vector q2/parenrightbig
. (21)
It is superintegrable. To reveal the structure of the algebra of in tegrals of
motion deﬁne the classical counterparts of creation/annihilation o perators:
6ai≡1√
2ω(pi−ıωqi), i= 1,2,3 (22)
Then
{ai,¯aj}=−ıδij. (23)
Further, let Λ a,a= 1,2,...,8 be the Gell-Mann matrices obeying SU(3) Lie
algebra commutation rules
[Λa,Λb] =ıdabcΛc (24)
Then the functions
Ca≡1
2ai(Λa)ijaj (25)
are real integrals of motion obeying
{Ca,Cb}=dabcCc. (26)
Let us now modify the parameter ω2:
ω2(˜H)≡ω2−2µ˜H, µ ∈R (27)
Following the prescription of the previous section we ﬁnd the Hamilton ian
[7, 8]
˜H=1
2/vector p2+ω2/vector q2
1+µ/vector q2(28)
Forµ≥0˜His non-singular everywhere; for µ <0 some care must be
exercised. The function Ω( q,p), eq. (4), takes the form
Ω(q,p) = 1+µ/vector q2(29)
7Forsimplicity consider thecase µ≥0. Assuming ˜E <ω2
2µwehaveω2(˜H)>0
(bounded motion). Eqs. (22), (24) are replaced by
˜ai=1/radicalBig
2ω(˜H)/parenleftBig
pi−ıω(˜H)qi/parenrightBig
, i= 1,2,3 (30)
˜Ca=1
2˜ai(Λa)ij˜aj (31)
According to the discussion of Sec. II ˜Caare integrals of motion obeying
SU(3) algebra
{˜Ca,˜Cb}=dabc˜Cc. (32)
Let us note that eq. (23) is no longer valid.
For˜E=ω2
2µ(˜E >ω2
2µ) the relevant symmetry algebra gets modiﬁed
appropriately.
Let us now add the linear term to harmonic potential,
H=1
2/parenleftbig
/vector p2+ω2/vector q2/parenrightbig
+/vectork·/vector q (33)
with/vectorkbeing a constant vector.
By making the canonical transformation
/vectorQ=/vector q+/vectork
ω2
/vectorP=/vector p(34)
Hreduces to harmonic oscillator:
H=1
2/parenleftBig
/vectorP2+ω2/vectorQ2/parenrightBig
+const (35)
Therefore, the superintegrability is preserved together with the structure of
8the symmetry algebra.
Making the substitution (27) one obtains the Hamiltonian studied in [9]
˜H=1
1+µ/vector q2/parenleftbigg1
2/parenleftbig
/vector p2+ω2/vector q2/parenrightbig
+/vectork·/vector q/parenrightbigg
(36)
Again, assuming ˜E <ω2
2µand deﬁning
ai=1/radicalBig
2ω(˜H)/parenleftbigg
pi−ıω(˜H)qi−ıki
ω(˜H)/parenrightbigg
, i= 1,2,3 (37)
we conclude that the integrals ˜Ca, eq. (31), obey SU(3) algebra. The price
one has to pay for having SU(3) algebra as the symmetry algebra is that the
integrals ˜Caare not polynomial in momenta. However, when multiplied by
ω3(˜H) they become polynomials; the modiﬁed integrals of motion obey then
the Poisson commutation rules with ˜H-dependent structure constants.
AsthenextexampleconsiderthegeneralizationofSmorodinsky-Win ternitz
system [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 10, 11]. The relevant Hamiltonian reads

in terms of them the Hamiltonian takes the form
H= 23/summationdisplay
k=1ωkIk+3/summationdisplay
k=1√

Assuming all ratiosωi

The integrals of motion can be chosen to obey Lie algebra commutatio n rules
9with respect to Poisson brackets [24]; it is again SU(3) algebra.
Let us now replace ω2→ω2−2µ˜H. Then

(41)
For regularity we assume µ >0. According to the discussion of the previous
section˜His superintegrable. Assuming ω2−2µ˜E >0 we ﬁnd also that the
integrals of motion can be chosen in such a way as to obtain SU(3) algebra.
The particular case of ˜H,n1=n2= 1,n3= 2 has been considered in [9].
It is instructive to analyze in more detail the integrals of motion for
the Hamiltonian (40) (and, consequently, the Hamiltonian (41)). Th e angle
variables for the dynamics (40) read
cosϕi=Ei−n2

withEi= 2ωniIi+√2kiωnibeing partial energies. It is easy to write out
the general form of the integral of motion [14]
C=/summationdisplay
{m}F{m}(I)3/productdisplay
k=1(eıϕk)mk(43)
with{m} ≡ {m1,m2,m3}being arbitrary triples of integers obeying
m1n1+m2n2+m3n3= 0 (44)
andF{m}(I) - arbitrary functions. Obviously, only ﬁve of these integrals
can be chosen as functionally independent. It is also clearly seen fro m eqs.
(42),(43) that one can choose the integrals as polynomials in moment a. For
example, for n1=n2= 1,n3= 2, the quadratic integral K4in [9] may be
written as
10ω2K4=E1·E2−/radicalBig
E2
1−2k1ω2/radicalBig
E2
2−2k2ω2cos(ϕ1−ϕ2) (45)
Now, for ω2−2µ˜E >0 the relevant integrals ˜Cfor Hamiltonian ˜Hcan be
obtained along the lines sketched in previous section.
Let us come back to the Hamiltonian (33). Adding a constant hto the
Hamiltonian and making the substitutions ω2→ω2−2µ˜H,/vectork→/vectork−˜H/vectorl,
h→h−h0˜Hwe ﬁnd
˜H=1
µ/vector q2+/vectorl·/vector q+h0+1/parenleftbigg/vector p2
2+ω2
2/vector q2+/vectork·/vector q+h/parenrightbigg
(46)
Considering two dimensions and putting li=δi1,ki=δi2,µ= 0,h0=−1 we
arrive at the one of the Hamiltonians considered in [14] (eq. (64) the rein).
Further, let us start with the two-dimensional Hamiltonian
H=1
2/vector p2+ω2
2/parenleftbig

1+q2

+k1q1+k2

which is superintegrable. We put h→h0+˜H,k1→ −˜H; then
˜H=/vector p2

2)
2q1+h0
q1+k2

which is the Hamiltonian (59) from [14].
III.2 Kepler-related systems
As a next example consider Kepler-related Hamiltonians. The initial
Hamiltonian for the textbook Kepler problem reads
H=1
2/vector p2+α
|/vector q2|, α <0 (49)
We make the replacement α→α+β˜Hwhich yields
˜H=/parenleftbigg|/vector q|
|/vector q|−β/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg1
2/vector p2+α
|/vector q|/parenrightbigg
(50)
11For regularity we assume β <0.˜His superintegrable. Except energy and
angular momentum it admits further integrals of motion in the form of gen-
eralized Runge-Lenz vector
˜/vectorA=/vectorA−mβ˜H/vector q
|/vector q|2(51)
where/vectorAis a standard Runge-Lenz vector.
The Kepler dynamics can be generalized in a way still preserving super -
integrability [10], [11], [12]:
H=1
2/vector p2+α
|/vector q|+3/summationdisplay
i=1ki
q2
i(52)
Under the same substitution α→α+β˜H, one ﬁnds
˜H=/parenleftbigg|/vector q|

2/vector p2+α
|/vector q|+3/summationdisplay

(53)
It deﬁnes, according to our ﬁndings, the superintegrable dynamic s. For a
more detailed discussion of its properties we refer the reader to [9]. The inte-
gralsofmotiondescribed therecanbederived using thetechnique in troduced
in the present paper.

i(eqs. (40) and (52)) can be generalized to the case of conﬁgura-
tion space of constant curvature [13]. Our procedure works also in this case.
For example, the curvature-dependent version of Smorodinsky- Winternitz
system leads to the following Hamiltonian

and

qκ2=sκ(r)sinθsinϕ
qκ3=sκ(r)cosθ(57)
These systems arediscussed indetail in[13]. Itfollowsimmediately tha tthey
are superintegrable and their integrals of motion can be obtained fo llowing
the procedure described in the present paper.
III.4 Henon-Heiles related system
The general Hamiltonian describing the Henon-Heiles system reads [4 ]
H=1

In general, Hdescribes nonintegrable dynamics except three cases [25]
(i)µ=−6, A,B- arbitrary
13(ii)µ=−1, A=B
(iii)µ=−16, B= 16A
By applying the general method described above one can deﬁne a nu mber
of Hamiltonians sharing the same phase space trajectories. Below w e present
few examples.
Consider ﬁrst the case (i). Upon making the replacement
A→A−2a˜H , B→B−2b˜H , C= 0 (59)
one arrives at
˜H=1
2/parenleftbig
p2
x+p2

is the integral of motion for initial dynamics [25].
On the other hand, keeping ﬁrst two substitutions (59) intact, we can put
C=˜Hwhich results in
˜H=1
2/vector p2+A
2x2+B
2y2+D(x2y+2y3)
ax2+by2(63)
Let us recall that, according to the general discussion in Sec. II, the trajec-
tories described by the Hamiltonian ˜H, eq. (63), with the energy ˜E, coincide
with those obtained from Hwith the vanishing energy and parameters A,B
replaced by A−2a˜E,B−2b˜E, respectively. In other words, the family of
14trajectories deﬁned by the given Hamiltonian ˜Hwith arbitrary energy ˜Eis
mapped to the trajectories of the family of Hamiltonians with parame ters
A−2a˜E,B−2b˜Eand vanishing energy.
The corresponding additional integral of motion is deﬁned again by e q. (61)
where˜His given now by (63).
Similar reasoning may be applied to the remaining cases ( ii), (iii). For
example, starting with

On the other hand, taking C=˜H, instead of C= 0, one ﬁnds

IV The relativistic-nonrelativisticcorrespon-
dence
An interesting picture emerges if one applies the algorithm described
above to relativistic dynamics. Consider the charged relativistic par ticle
15moving in a static electromagnetic ﬁeld. Then one can choose the pot entials
ϕand/vectorAto be time independent. The relevant Hamiltonian reads
H=c/radicalbigg
(/vector p−e
c/vectorA)2+m2c2+eϕ+D (69)
where/vector pstands forthecanonical momentum while Disanarbitraryconstant.
Let us make the substitution
m2→m2(˜H)≡m2−2m˜H
c2(70)
D→D(˜H)≡˜H−D; (71)
in order to keep m2(˜H) nonnegative we have to assume
˜H≤mc2
2(72)
The general scheme described in previous sections results in the fo llowing
Hamiltonian

Due to the condition (72) we have to restrict ourselves to the traj ectories
obeying

2m(/vector p−e

2mc2≤0 (74)
Byskipping the constant in(73) we conclude that the relevant nonr elativistic
motion is described by the Hamiltonian
16˜H=1
2m(/vector p−e
c/vectorA)2−(eϕ−D)2
2mc2(75)
together with the condition
˜H≤0. (76)
Replacing eq. (73) by eq. (75) leads to the following modiﬁcation of eq . (70):

Due to the spherical symmetry of both Hamiltonians the motions are plane

The relation between relativistic and nonrelativistic trajectories, d escribed
above, can be now conﬁrmed by explicit calculations. For both Hamilto nians
the total energy and angular momentum pΘare conserved so one can proceed

18provided E=Dand eq. (87) holds true. This shows explicitly that both
sets of trajectories coincide. However, there are some further constraints. If
we restrict ourselves to the nonrelativistic motion the only condition for the
existence of trajectories follows from eq. (88).
E−Ueff(r)≥0 (89)
for some r∈R+. On the other hand, the trajectories determined by eq. (88)
can be viewed as describing the relativistic motion if, in addition,

In what follows we restrict ourselves to the case of attracting Cou lomb
potential, α <0, leaving the α >0 case to the reader.
ForD≥0 eq. (91) is automatically satisﬁed. Therefore, taking into accoun t
the ﬁrst condition, eq. (90), all nonrelativistic trajectories can b e viewed as
relativistic ones provided the nonrelativistic energy obeys
˜E≤D2
2mc2(92)
Depending on whether c2p2

c2p2

r=α2−c2p2

(93)
On the other hand, if c2p2

19r=c2p2
Θ−α2

(pΘD)2−m2/parenleftBig

The case D <0 is more subtle. In particular, if c2p2
Θ≥α2the nonrelativis-
tic motion is possible for any ˜E >0 while no trajectory can be viewed as
describing relativistic motion (due to the negativity of kinetic energy ). For
α2> c2p2
Θall nonrelativistic energies are allowed, −∞<˜E <∞. However,
only the trajectories describing the fall to the centre with ˜E <D
2mccan be
also viewed as relativistic ones. They are given again by Eq.(93) with Dnow
beeing negative.
V Darboux and Hietarinta methods
In the eighties Hietarinta et al. introduced a very nice method, know n as
coupling-constant metamorphosis, of constructing new Hamiltonia ns out of
the given ones. It consists in exchanging the roles of a coupling cons tant and
energy while preserving the form of unparameterized trajectorie s in phase
space. This method is somehow related to the theorem proven by Da rboux
in 1889 [1] (see also [2]). Both Darboux theorem and Hietarinta metho d
nicely ﬁt into general framework described in Sec. II.
Let us start with the natural Hamiltonian of the form
H=1
2gij(q)pipj−λU(q); (95)
hereλis an arbitrary coupling constant and we follow the nonstandard con -
vention denoting by −λUthe potential energy. Adding to the right hand
side the constant λ−1 and making the replacement λ→˜Hwe arrive at the
new Hamiltonian (cf. eq. (3))
˜H=1
U/parenleftbigg1
2gijpipj−1/parenrightbigg
(96)
Let
20qi= ˜qi/parenleftBig
˜t,˜E/parenrightBig
, pi= ˜pi/parenleftBig
˜t,˜E/parenrightBig
(97)
where
˜E=1
U/parenleftbigg1
2gijpipj−1/parenrightbigg
, (98)
denote the solutions to the canonical equations for the Hamiltonian (96).
Then the solutions to the canonical equations for Hcan be written in the
form (cf. eqs. (4), (6), (7), (8))
qi=qi/parenleftBig
t;λ=˜E/parenrightBig
= ˜qi/parenleftBig
˜t(t),˜E/parenrightBig
, pi=pi/parenleftBig
t;λ=˜E/parenrightBig
= ˜pi/parenleftBig
˜t(t),˜E/parenrightBig
(99)
where
d˜t
dt≡Ω =U. (100)
The Lagrangians corresponding to Hand˜Hread, respectively (up to irrele-
vant additive constants)
L=1
2gij˙qi˙qj+λU (101)
˜L=U
2gij˙qi˙qj+1
U(102)
Now, according to the Darboux theorem [1]: the unparametrized t rajectories
in conﬁguration space for the Lagrangians ˜L(cf. eq. (102)) and L′deﬁned
by the formula
L′=1
2gij˙qi˙qj+U (103)
coincide and the energies ˜EandE′corresponding to ˜LandL′, respectively
satisfy the relation
21E′·˜E= 1. (104)
Both conclusions follow from our approach. In fact, the solution q′i=q′i(t)
to the Lagrange equations for L′can be written in terms of the solutions
qi=qi(t;λ) to the Lagrange equations for Las follows
q′i(t) =qi/parenleftbigg1√
λt;λ/parenrightbigg
(105)
Puttingλ=˜Eandtakinginto accounttheﬁrstofequations(99)weconclude
q′i(t) = ˜qi/parenleftBigg

(106)
The energy E′corresponding to L′
E′=1
2gijdqi′i

dt−U (107)
when expressed in term of ˜ qi(cf. eq. (100)) reads
E′=U2
˜E1
2gijd˜qi
d˜td˜qj
d˜t−U (108)
By comparing eq. (108) with the energy corresponding to ˜L
˜E=U
2gijd˜qi
d˜td˜qj
d˜t−1
U(109)
we ﬁnd the relation (104).
As far as the Hietarinta et al. method is concerned one rewrites the Hamil-
tonian (1) from Ref. [3] by adding the constant
H=H0−gF+(g−h) (110)
Lettingg=˜H≡Gone arrives at the formula (2) from [3]
G=H0
F−h
F(111)
22VI Conclusions and outlook
We proposed a general framework for constructing, for a given H amil-
tonian, the whole family of new Hamiltonians sharing the same set of un -
parameterized trajectories in phase space. Once the symmetry o f initial
Hamiltonian is known our approach provides the complete character ization
of the symmetry structure of new Hamiltonian systems. In fact, e qs. (11)
and (14)-(17) imply that the integrals of motion for the latter can b e imme-
diately constructed provided those corresponding to the initial Ha miltonian
are known.
We have shown that our approach covers many examples considere d re-
cently in the literature as well as provides the new ones. We present ed only
some of them. It is interesting to note that further, more complica ted, ex-
amples can be obtained by applying the algorithm iteratively.
Our procedure provides a far reaching generalization of Hietarinta et al.
coupling constant-energy metamorphosis method [3]. It allows also to give
an alternative proof of Darboux theorem.
Moreover, we found an interesting relation between nonrelativistic and
relativistic dynamics which, up to our best knowledge, hasn’t been dis cussed
sofar. Asanexample, therelativistic motioninattractiveCoulombpo tential
has been considered insome detail; in particular, the family of nonrela tivistic
potentials yielding the same trajectories was exhibited.
The method presented above is both fairly general and ﬂexible. Firs t, let
us note that it can be extended by assuming that the parameters λαdepend,
apart from the Hamiltonian, on other integrals of motion (when they exist).
This opens the way to construct still more general new Hamiltonian s ystems.
It appears also that the judicious choice of the initial Hamiltonian allow s to
obtainthestandardHamiltonian onlocally ﬂatconﬁgurationspace; h owever,
the global structure of the latter becomes more complicated.
One can also apply the present approach to the study of geodesics on
(pseudo)Riemannian manifolds. In particular, it provides a nice way t o con-
struct the Carter integral for null geodesics in Kerr metric.
What is more, it seems that our procedure can be used to analyze th e
generalization of Bertrand’s theorem, bothinthe spirit of Perlick’s p aper [27]
and the relativistic motion in central potentials (i.e. when the Hamilton ian
is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and central potential).
Some of these problems will be studied in subsequent publications.
