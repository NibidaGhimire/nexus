ABSTRACT
We present a strong lensing analysis of COOL J1241+2219, the brightest known gravitationally lensed
galaxy at z≥5, based on new multi-band Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data. The lensed
galaxy has a redshift of z= 5.043, placing it shortly after the end of the Epoch of Reionization, and an
AB magnitude zAB= 20.47 mag (Khullar et al. 2021a). As such, it serves as a touchstone for future re-
search of that epoch. The high spatial resolution of HST reveals internal structure in the giant arc, from
which we identify 15 constraints and construct a robust lens model. We use the lens model to extract
cluster mass and lensing magnification. We find that the mass enclosed within the Einstein radius of
thez= 1.001 cluster lens is M(<5.′′77) = 1 .079+0.023
−0.007×1013M⊙, significantly lower than other known
strong lensing clusters at its redshift. The average magnification of the giant arc is < µarc>=76+40
−20,
a factor of 2 .4+1.4
−0.7greater than previously estimated from ground-based data; the flux-weighted aver-
age magnification is < µarc>=92+37
−31. We update the current measurements of the stellar mass and
star formation rate (SFR) of the source for the revised magnification, log( M⋆/M⊙) = 9 .7±0.3 and
SFR =10 .3+7.0
−4.4M⊙yr−1. The powerful lensing magnification acting upon COOL J1241+2219 resolves
the source and enables future studies of the properties of its star formation on a clump-by-clump basis.
The lensing analysis presented here will support upcoming multiwavelength characterization with HST
and JWST data of the stellar mass assembly and physical properties of this high-redshift lensed galaxy.

Gravitational lensing is nature’s telescope: massive
foreground structures, such as galaxy clusters, magnify
and distort background galaxies, greatly increasing the
angular extent of the source and the number of photons
that reach the observer. Using observational evidence
of gravitational lensing, we can reconstruct the gravita-
tional potential of the lens and study the mass distribu-
tion of the foreground cluster and the physical properties
of the distant galaxies that the cluster lenses. Strong
gravitational lensing can greatly magnify galaxies that
would otherwise be too dim to study, allowing for spatial
resolution of 100s or even 10s of parsecs (e.g., Johnson
et al. 2017a,b; Cornachione et al. 2018; Claeyssens et al.
2023; Welch et al. 2023; Vanzella et al. 2023). With a ro-
bust lens model, the lensed galaxy can be de-lensed into
a high-resolution projection of the background galaxy in
the source plane. These fortuitous alignments of back-
ground galaxies and strong gravitational lenses give us
the best possible glimpse into the distant universe, pro-
viding detailed information on the physical properties
of galaxies. While wide surveys like the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS; Ahumada et al. 2020) have identi-
fied many bright z <3 lensed galaxies, such discoveries
are rare at higher redshifts (Franx et al. 1997; Soifer
et al. 1998; Frye et al. 2002; Kubo et al. 2010; Bayliss
et al. 2011; Stark et al. 2013; Gladders et al. 2002).
COOL J1241+2219 (hereafter COOL J1241), is a
bright, strongly lensed galaxy at z= 5.043, lensed
by a galaxy cluster at z=1.001. It was discovered
by the ChicagO Optically selected Lenses—Located At
the Margins of Public Surveys collaboration (COOL-
LAMPS; Khullar et al. 2021a, hereafter, K21). The pro-
gram seeks to find strong lensing systems in sky surveys
for follow-up observation and analysis. The discovery,
and an initial analysis based on ground-based data, are
reported in K21. Remarkably, COOL J1241 has an AB
magnitude z= 20.47 mag; it is ∼5 to 13 times brighter
and 2−4% farther away than the brightest known lensed
galaxies at z∼5 (Gladders et al. 2002; Franx et al. 1997;
Soifer et al. 1998; Frye et al. 2002). COOL J1241 is one
of the rarest and most fortunate examples of strong grav-
itational lensing.
By the redshift of COOL J1241, z∼5, the Epoch of
Reionization had ended (e.g., Fan et al. 2006; see Gnedin
& Madau 2022; Robertson 2022 for recent reviews) and
the cosmic star formation rate was rapidly increasing.
K21 found that COOL J1241 has a stellar mass simi-
lar to that of the Milky Way and a star formation rate
(SFR) that is one to two orders of magnitude higher.
However, COOL J1241 is unlike other known galaxies
within this epoch due to its lower relative dust content
and SFR (K21). This points to a star formation historywith potentially significant mass assembly in the recent
past (for it to have formed its stellar mass so rapidly);
although how many epochs of bursty star formation oc-
curred, or how long these star forming episodes were, is
unclear with extant data. The effect of dust-enshrouded
star formation on total star formation rate in this epoch
is still not understood (Casey et al. 2019; Mowla et al.
2022; Claeyssens et al. 2023). Upcoming JWST data
(JWST Cycle 1, ID 2566; PI: Khullar; Khullar et al.
2021b) will allow for a deconstruction of the complete
star formation history and characterization of mass as-
sembly in this system.
K21 constructed a lens model of this system using
ground-based data in the J−and H−bands from
the FourStar Infrared Camera (FourStar; Persson et al.
2008) on the Magellan/Baade telescope in Chile, as well
as in the g,r,i, and zbands from the Parallel Imager
for Southern Cosmology Observations (PISCO; Stalder
et al. 2014). As is the case with ground-based data, the
resolution was low. Nevertheless, the data still enabled a
rudimentary lens model and mass approximation for the
galaxy cluster, and a preliminary source analysis. With
HST, a higher spatial resolution provides better lensing
constraints, leading to a more robust mass and magni-
fication measurement (e.g., Sharon et al. 2012; Sukay
et al. 2022; Zhuang et al. 2023).
The goal of this paper is to present an improved,
space-based lens model that allows us to extract more
accurate and precise information about both the lens
and the source, and create a stepping stone towards fu-
ture study with forthcoming JWST data. This paper is
structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the HST
imaging and data reduction. In Section 3, we present the
methods used to generate a lens model, measure mass
and magnifications, and obtain their uncertainties. In
Section 4, we present the results of the model, namely
the mass and magnification maps, as well as the mag-
nification measurements. Finally, in Section 5, we use
our results to revise the findings of K21, and discuss the
significance of the results in the context of high redshift
galaxies and strong lensing galaxy clusters at z≳1.
We assume a flat universe with parameters H0= 70
km s−1Mpc−1, Ωm= 0.3, and Ω Λ= 0.7. Mag-
nitudes are presented in the AB system. The spec-
troscopically measured cluster and source redshifts are
zcluster = 1.001, zsource = 5.043, respectively, which
correspond to 8 .0106 and 6 .2561 kpc per arcsec in this
cosmology.
2.DATA
The data were collected as part of a joint Very Large
Array (VLA) and HST program (VLA/2020-07-025,3
Figure 1. HST imaging of COOL J1241, rendered from F160W (red), F814W (green) and F606W (blue). The best-fit lens
model is overplotted. Solid red lines denote the critical curve for a source at z= 5.043. The cyan arrows point to the brightest
cluster galaxy (BCG), and a galaxy-scale halo (G1) whose parameters were optimized by the model. Magenta ×symbols
mark the locations of critical curve constraints (X 2was carried over from K21, and X 2was constraint 1.2 in K21). Multiple
images that were used to constrain the lens model are labeled with circles and letters, and color-coded according to their source
identification (see Table 1).
HST-GO 16484, PI: A. Stark; Stark et al. 2020). The
data include 3 orbits of HST imaging split between
four broad-band filters: half an orbit each for two
WFC3/IR bands, F110W (1012 s) and F160W (1212
s) observed on 2022 Jan 4, and one orbit in each oftwo ACS bands, F814W and F606W (2080 s each) ob-
served on 2021 Dec 10. The ACS data were obtained
with a simple 4-point dither sequence using the stan-
dard ACS-WFC-DITHER-BOX . Because the observed lens-
ing configuration suggested that a few tens of arcseconds4
around the lens center are of most interest, there was no
need to fill the chip gap. The chip 2 pointing aperture
was used in order to avoid a star on the field edges that
could enter the field of view at some roll angles.
The orbit packing of the single WFC3-IR orbit was
guided by a goal of obtaining a minimum of four
dithered images per filter for adequate PSF sam-
pling. Four images per filter were obtained with
theWFC3-IR-DITHER-BOX-MIN pattern, using NSAMP =11
andSPARS25 for F110W and NSAMP =7 and SPARS50 for
F160W, resulting in a slightly longer observing time in
F160W due to buffer time constraints.
We reduced the data using the DrizzlePac python
package1as follows. We obtained the individual pre-
processed frames from the MAST archive shortly after
data acquisition. We used AstroDrizzle to co-add the
sub-exposures of each filter, using a gaussian kernel drop
size of 0 .8 for the ACS images and 1 .0 for WFC3. For
WFC3/IR data, we applied a secondary correction of
the infrared (IR) blobs using a model-based flat-fielding
technique (Sharon et al. 2020) prior to combining the in-
dividual IR exposures. We used TweakReg to match the
WCS solution of imaging data that were obtained in dif-
ferent epochs (i.e., the WFC3 and ACS data). We then
propagated the solution back to the individual frames
using TweakBack , and re-drizzled to obtain the final
set of CTE corrected, cosmic-ray and bad-pixel rejected
images, with a common reference frame and a pixel
scale of 0 .′′03 pixel−1. A representative HST (F160W,
F814W, F606W) color image of the strong lensing re-
gion of COOL J1241 is shown in Figure 1.
3.METHODS
3.1. Lensing Evidence
The lensing analysis of K21 assumed that the lensing
configuration of COOL J1241 is a common three-image
arc with a counter-image, and that a high magnification
near the critical curve is responsible for the high bright-
ness of a clump near the center of the giant arc. As
we describe below, the ground-based imaging used for
their analysis had insufficient resolution to reveal the
complexity of the system.
In the common three-image arc configuration, three
near-complete images of the source merge to form a giant
arc (e.g., SDSS J1110+6459, Johnson et al. 2017b; SPT-
CL J2011 −5228, Collett et al. 2017) with the critical
curve crossing the arc in two places, defining clear mir-
ror symmetry on its opposite sides. If a counter-image
forms (in configurations other than a “naked cusp”), it is
1http://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/software/drizzlepac.
htmlusually a less-magnified, complete image. The high res-
olution of our shallow HST imaging reveals the clumpi-
ness of the source, and makes it clear that the lensing
configuration of COOL J1241 deviates from the com-
mon three-image arc configuration. We identified sev-
eral star-forming clumps along the arc and used their
relative surface brightness and slight variations in color
to match and identify them as multiple image instances
of unique regions in the source galaxy. We label the
clumps in Figure 1, and their coordinates are listed in
Table 1. We find that similarly to the common three-
image arc configuration described above, COOL J1241
has an image of the source in each end of its giant arc,
which match the complete, less magnified counter image
near the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). However, most
of the middle segment of the arc is not easily mapped
to the other images. It appears to contain two bright
clumps that do not match other clumps in terms of
surface brightness and morphology. The counter image
lacks a clump with such high surface brightness. The
only likely explanation of these bright clumps along the
arc is that they are a result of extreme magnification,
caused by very close proximity to the source plane caus-
tic (a.k.a., “caustic crossing”), as was concluded by K21
for the brightest clump. Such scenarios have been re-
ported in the literature for other systems (e.g., Welch
et al. 2022a,b; Diego et al. 2022; Meena et al. 2023).
In the case of COOL J1241, it is likely that the central
portion of the arc forms along the critical curve like a
segment of an Einstein ring (e.g., the “Cosmic Horse-
shoe”; Bellagamba et al. 2017).
K21 used as constraints three brightness peaks along
the arc, under the assumption that these are the cores of
the lensed galaxy, matched to the center of the candidate
counter image. In addition, they used two regions with
similar surface brightness marking the edges of the star-
forming clump that was assumed to be merging on the
critical curve.
With the new high-resolution HST imaging, we find
that the brightest regions of the giant arc formed as a
result of high magnification or multiplicity rather than
being a dominant core of the source galaxy. For the
brightest of the clumps, our analysis concurs with the
assumption of K21 that the brightest clump sits on top
of the critical curve. Conversely, the peak brightness in
the north segment of the arc, identified as 1.3 in K21,
is actually resolved in the HST data into two images of
one star-forming clump separated by 0 .′′7, with mirror
symmetry (labeled 2.D and 2.G in Figure 1 and Ta-
ble 1). To form these two images requires that a critical
curve crosses the arc north of its assumed crossing in the
K21 model, likely due to a contribution from a cluster-5
member galaxy ∼1.′′7 west of the arc that complicates
the lensing potential in that region.
Image 1.2 of K21 is a compact clump whose brightness
and morphology are not matched by any other clump,
and therefore could also be associated with caustic cross-
ing. Finally, the regions north and south of the brightest
clump are not symmetrical, providing evidence that the
critical curve is not perpendicular to the arc at this lo-
cation. We describe the new lensing constraints below.
Our model uses as constraints three unique
star-forming clumps within the source galaxy of
COOL J1241, and three critical curve constraints on
the giant arc. The clumps were identified based on sim-
ilarities in surface brightness and color. Only the most
secure clump identifications were used as constraints.
We did not include constraints from the middle section
of the arc because these were hard to robustly identify
as multiple images of the clumps in the north and south
ends of the arc and the counter image. This region is
primarily constrained by forcing the critical curve to
pass through points on the arc as determined by the
lensing symmetry.
The critical curve constraint X2marks the brightest
part of the giant arc, a constraint that was carried over
from K21. X3in the north of the arc forces the model
to form the mirror image geometry of 2.D and 2.G. Fi-
nally, X1accounts for a bright clump that does not map
properly to other images. The most likely interpretation
is that a region of the background galaxy is located al-
most directly under the lensing caustic, resulting in a
highly magnified image of that region. Adding this con-
straint to the model resulted in better agreement be-
tween predicted and observed lensing constraints, i.e.,
better image-plane rms. In Table 1, we list the coor-
dinates, group, and image IDs of each of the identified
image constraints, and the location of the critical curve
constraints in arcseconds relative to the BCG.
While the HST data resulted in several precise con-
straints along the giant arc and its counter-image, which
improved upon the constraints of K21, the data did not
reveal any new lensed galaxies. We detected some blue
sources in the field, but were unable to robustly con-
firm them as strongly lensed nor obtain a spectroscopic
redshift for them. Additionally, the location of some
of these candidates, whose projected distance from the
BCG placed them farther than the radius of the main
arc, implies that they should be at a higher redshift than
COOL J1241. Such a high redshift is ruled out by the
blue color of these candidates. We, therefore, conclude
that these sources are unlikely strongly lensed and ex-
clude them from our analysis.The lack of constraints from multiple source planes is
a weakness of the model, as its leverage over the inner
slope of the mass distribution is limited, resulting in
systematic uncertainties that are not well captured by
the error analysis (e.g., Johnson & Sharon 2016).
3.2. Lens Modeling
We computed the model using the Lenstool (Jullo
et al. 2007) software, following the procedure described
in Sharon et al. (2020). Lenstool assumes a parametric
model of the projected mass distribution of the clus-
ter lens, and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling of the parameter space to find the model that
results in the smallest image-plane rms scatter between
the observed images and those predicted by the lens
model. The cluster lens was modeled as a linear combi-
nation of mass halos representing the dark matter distri-
bution of the cluster and its large scale structure as well
as individual cluster-member galaxies. Each halo was
assumed to have a pseudo-isothermal ellipsoidal mass
distribution (dPIE, also referred to as PIEMD in the
literature; Jullo et al. 2007; El´ ıasd´ ottir et al. 2007) with
seven parameters: position ( x,y), ellipticity ( e), posi-
tion angle ( θ), core and cut radii ( rcore,rcut), and ef-
fective velocity dispersion ( σ). Cluster-member galaxies
were selected photometrically, based on their color with
respect to the red sequence (Gladders & Yee 2000) in a
color-magnitude diagram. We used F814W-F110W vs
F110W, which provides a good sampling of the 4000 ˚A
break in the spectral energy distribution of quiescent
galaxies at the cluster redshift. The cluster-member
galaxies were also parameterized as dPIE halos, with
positional parameters ( x,y,θ,e) fixed to their light dis-
tribution as measured with Source Extractor (Bertin &
Arnouts 1996) and their slope parameters and normal-
ization scaled to their measured magnitudes in F110W
using scaling relations as described in Limousin et al.
(2005).
The best-fit solution of the lens plane used three halos
with free parameters: a cluster-scale halo representing
the cluster, and two galaxy-scale halos that were decou-
pled from the cluster-member catalog. These cluster-
member galaxies were the BCG, which is not expected
to follow the same scaling relations as other cluster-
member galaxies; and the galaxy labeled G1 in Figure 1,
because of its proximity to the giant arc. The positional
parameters of these galaxies were fixed, but some or all
of their slope parameters were allowed to vary and the
best-fit solution was identified by the lens modeling pro-

4.RESULTSThe lens plane is well described by a dominant dark-
matter halo, representing the cluster-scale mass distri-
bution, supplemented with galaxy-scale halos represent-
ing the BCG and cluster-member galaxies. Contribution
to the lensing potential from galaxy G1 was required in
order to reproduce the lensing configuration of the star
forming clumps observed in the giant arc. The normal-
ization parameter σof G1 was optimized individually,
in order to add flexibility to the lens model and avoid
biasing the scaling relation parameters towards a solu-
tion that is primarily driven by one galaxy. The model
predicts a demagnified fifth image of the source behind
the BCG, 5-6 magnitudes fainter than the observed arcs.
Given its magnification, it is not expected to be visible
in the data. The model has 14 free parameters and 24
constraints and results with an rms scatter of 0 .′′16 for
predicted images in the image plane.
In Table 2 we tabulate the best-fit lens model param-
eters and their uncertainties, as determined from the
MCMC sampling of the parameter space. Figure 1 dis-
plays the lensing constraints and the critical curves for a
source at z= 5.043 derived from the best-fit lens model.
Figure 2 shows the best-fit magnification map for a
source at z= 5.043. Representative magnification val-
ues at the locations of the lensing constraints are pre-
sented in Table 1. The errors were estimated by gener-
ating 100 models sampled from the MCMC chain and
finding the 16th and 84th percentile of the magnifica-
tion at each coordinate. The uncertainties represent
statistical modeling errors, and do not take into account
systematic uncertainties. As expected, regions in close
proximity to the critical curve have higher magnification
and uncertainty.
A calculation of the average magnification of the en-
tire arc is complicated by the proximity of the arc to the
critical curve, which marks regions in the image plane
where a point source would theoretically have infinite
magnification. To avoid numerical effects near the criti-
cal curve, we calculated the magnification by comparing
the image plane area to the source plane area as follows.
We traced the arc with an aperture of width 0 .′′8; us-
ing the deflection matrices αof the best-fit model and
the 100 models sampled from the MCMC, we ray-traced
the aperture to the source plane using the lens equa-
tion, β=θ−α(θ), where βis the source position, θ
is the image position, and αis the lensing deflection at
position θ. We then used the ratio of image plane to
source plane areas to calculate the average magnifica-
tion and its uncertainty. The same approach was used
by K21; we compare our magnification measurements in
Section 5. The average magnification of the entire gi-7

image plane rms of the best-fit model is 0 .′′16.
ant arc is < µarc>= 76+40
−20, and the counter image is
magnified by < µc.i.>= 6.6+2.6
−2.2.
The mean projected distance between the giant arc
and the BCG is 5 .′′77. The mass enclosed within this
radius, from our lensing analysis, is M(<5.′′77) =
1.079+0.023
−0.007×1013M⊙. The analytical expression for the
mass enclosed within the Einstein radius of a spheri-
cally symmetrical lens is M(< θE) = Σ crπ[DLθE]2=
1.17×1013M⊙for an Einstein radius of θE= 5.′′77,
corresponding to 46.2 kpc at the lens redshift. In this
equation, Σ cris the critical density for lensing, and
DLis the angular diameter distance to the lens (see,
e.g., Kneib & Natarajan 2011). Using numerical simula-
tions, Remolina Gonz´ alez et al. (2020) showed that the
M(< θE) analytical mass estimate for systems with a
similar lensing configuration as COOL J1241 (azimuthal
arc coverage of ∼40%) is biased high by 10% and has
9% uncertainty after correcting this bias. This bias is
primarily a result of mass distribution ellipticity devi-
ating from the assumed spherical symmetry. Apply-
ing this correction to the analytical estimate results in
Mcorr(< θE) = 1 .07±0.11×1013M⊙. We report that our
lens model-based mass measurement and the analytical
estimate for M(< θE) are consistent within uncertain-
ties.
5.DISCUSSION
The strong gravitational lensing model for
COOL J1241 facilitates the ongoing and future inves-
tigation of the lensed z= 5.043 background galaxy
and its intrinsic properties, such as star formation rate,
stellar mass, morphology, and the sizes of star-forming
clumps.
5.1. Comparison to the Previously Published Lensing
Analysis of COOL J1241
One of the primary results of this paper is the sig-
nificant difference between our lens model and the K21model. Due to the ground-based seeing limitations, the
data used by K21 did not have the resolution needed to
properly resolve the clumpiness of the arc. As a result,
their ability to correctly interpret the lensing configu-
ration was reduced, and the low number of available
constraints limited the number of free parameters and
complexity of the lens model. Section 3.1 details the
differences in modeling assumptions and lensing con-
straints between the two models. Because the critical
curve was constrained to intersect the arc in three places,
the new model predicts that a large portion of the arc
forms along the critical curve, resembling a segment of
an Einstein ring. As a result, our measurement of the av-
erage magnification of the arc is significantly higher than
the previous model, < µ > =76+40
−20vs< µ > = 32+8
−5.
This difference, of a factor of 2 .4+1.4
−0.7higher, propagates
to the measurements of the intrinsic properties of the
lensed galaxy as we describe in Section 5.3. This is per-
haps an anecdotal indication of a global concern with
the inaccuracy of ground-based data for lensing models.
It is also notable that our model results in a higher frac-
tional statistical uncertainty on the magnification, which
is counter intuitive to what is expected from models us-
ing space-based resolution. The high statistical uncer-
tainty is due to the proximity of a large portion of the
arc to the critical curve, where uncertainties are high. A
future analysis of JWST NIRCam data (JWST ID 2566,
Khullar et al. 2021b) may reveal infrared color variation
that can be used to increase the constraining power of
the lensing evidence, reduce the magnification uncer-
tainties, and improve the accuracy of the lens model.
5.2. Comparison to Strong Lensing Clusters at z≳1
Attempting to compare our mass estimate of the fore-
ground cluster that lenses COOL J1241 to that of other
z≳1 clusters is not straightforward. While numer-
ous clusters and protoclusters are now known in this8
redshift bin, an estimate of their masses usually comes
from mass proxies such as X-ray emission, the Sunyaev
Zel’dovich (SZ) effect, or from weak lensing. As such,
most mass estimates available in the literature are re-
ported for r200corr500c, which represent the radius from
the center of the cluster where the density is 200 or 500
times the critical density of the Universe at the cluster
redshift (or similarly, 200 times the mean density, for
M200,m). Given that our mass measurement relies solely
on constraints from the arc and its counter image at the
innermost core of the cluster, we cannot reliably extrap-
olate it beyond a few tens of arcseconds in projection
from the BCG. The aforementioned mass proxies lack
the spatial resolution to measure the mass at the small
cluster-centric radii that strong lensing probes. Since a
mass comparison to the general population of clusters
would be unreliable, we situate the strong lensing in-
ferred mass we measured at the core of the cluster lens
COOL J1241 in the context of other known strong lens-
ing clusters at z≳1.
To date, there are only a handful of strong lensing
clusters at z > 1 in the literature, with cluster mass
estimates using a variety of techniques and at different
radii. SPT-CL J0356 −5337, a z= 1.0359 cluster and
a major merger candidate, has a projected mass den-
sity of M(<500 kpc) = 4 .0±0.8×1014M⊙(Mahler
et al. 2020) inferred from strong lensing analysis, and
M500c= 3.59+0.59
−0.66×1014M⊙(Bocquet et al. 2019)
from SZ effect. SPT-CL J0546 −5345 at z= 1.067, has
a total mass of M200= 1.0+0.6
−0.4×1015M⊙, measured by
Brodwin et al. (2010) by combining optical, dynamical,
X-ray, and SZ mass proxies. Andersson et al. (2011)
reported M500= 5.3±1.3×1014M⊙for this cluster.
IDCS J1426.5+3508 is at z= 1.75 (Gonzalez et al. 2012)
with a Chandra X-ray mass measurement of M500,Lx=
3.3±0.1×1014M⊙(Stanford et al. 2012) and a SZ mass
measurement of M200,m= 4.3±1.1×1014M⊙(Brodwin
et al. 2012). SPT-CL J2011 −5228 is at z= 1.064, with
M500= 2.25±0.89×1014M⊙(Reichardt et al. 2013)
from SZ effect. Collett et al. (2017) report a mass within
an Einstein radius of θE= 14.′′01 of ME∼1.6×1014M⊙
from a strong lensing analysis of this cluster. Finally,
SPT-CL J0205 −5829 at z= 1.322 has a mass estimate
ofM500= 4.8±0.8×1014M⊙from combined X-ray and
SZ analysis (Stalder et al. 2013; Bleem et al. 2015).
As noted above, absent mass proxies at larger cluster-
centric radii, an extrapolation of the strong lensing in-
ferred mass of the cluster lens COOL J1241 to R200,
R500, or even to a few hundred kpc, is highly inaccurate.
We therefore opted to compare its well-constrained in-
ner core mass to that of the other lensing clusters in its
redshift bin, listed above. The projected mass densitywithin the Einstein radius of a strong lensing cluster is
well constrained from the strong lensing evidence alone,
even without a detailed lens model, as was quantita-
tively demonstrated by Remolina Gonz´ alez et al. (2021).
We adopt the mass within the Einstein radius derived
for SPT-CL J2011 −5228 by Collett et al. (2017), M(<
θE) = 1 .6×1014M⊙. For SPT-CL J0356 −5337, Mahler
et al. (2020) reports an Einstein radius θE= 14′′for a
source at z= 3, derived from their best-fit lens model.
This translates to M(<14′′) = 8 .6±0.9×1013M⊙, as-
suming 10% uncertainty. For IDCS J1426.5+3508, Gon-
zalez et al. (2012) report an arc radius of θE= 14.′′2±0.′′2
and calculate a lower limit for the mass within the Ein-
stein radius of M(< θE) = 6 .9±0.3×1013M⊙, after
accounting for the unknown redshift of the arc, and cor-
recting for the overestimate associated with this method,
which they estimated to be a factor of 1 .6. For the
two remaining clusters, SPT-CL J0546 −5345 and SPT-
CL J0205 −5829, we measured the arc distance using
archival HST data from programs GO-12477 and GO-
15294. We reduced the data following the same process
as described in Section 2, and inspected the multi-band
imaging (F160W, F814W, F606W) for lensing evidence.
We find that the prominent arc in SPT-CL J0205 −5829
is projected 20 ±1′′from the BCG. The HST data of
SPT-CL J0546 −5345 reveal several arc candidates, one
of which was visible in ground-based data (Staniszewski
et al. 2009). The geometry of this arc indicates that
it is associated with a massive substructure in the west
part of the cluster core, and may not be indicative of the
mass of the primary cluster core. We therefore opted to
use for our analysis the arc with the largest radius that
is not likely to be tracing that structure, at a distance
of 23.′′5±1′′northwest of the BCG. A third prominent
arc appears in the near IR (F160W) 14′′northeast of
the BCG. None of the arcs in these two clusters have a
known spectroscopic redshift measurement in the liter-
ature. We calculated the mass within the Einstein radii
of these two clusters using the equation in Section 4,
for two source redshifts spanning the reasonable redshift
range for sources to be lensed and visible in the available
data, zarc= 3,6. We applied the quadratic empirical
correction from Remolina Gonz´ alez et al. (2020) to ob-
tain the corrected masses and their associated uncertain-
ties here: Mcorr(< θE) = (1 .6±0.3−2.7±0.5)×1014M⊙
andMcorr(< θE) = (1 .4±0.2−3.1±0.5)×1014M⊙for
SPT-CL J0546 −5345 and SPT-CL J0205 −5829, respec-
tively.
To summarize, the core mass of the five strong lensing
clusters at z >1 ranges between ∼0.7−1.6×1014M⊙.
The lensing cluster COOL J1241 has a significantly
smaller Einstein radius and enclosed mass than other9
strong lensing clusters at its redshift, M(<5.′′77) =
1.079+0.023
−0.007×1013M⊙. This result is consistent with
our expectations from the different discovery methods
of these clusters. The SPT clusters were detected due
to their deep potential well that is responsible for the
SZ signal, while COOL J1241 was discovered due to the
presence of the giant arc irrespective of its cluster mass.
While the core of the cluster is consistent with it being
a low-mass galaxy cluster or group, the small Einstein
radius and corresponding enclosed mass could alterna-
tively be due to a diffuse mass distribution with low
concentration.
Finally, we note that while not advisable, a measure-
ment of the mass out to large radii of a few hundred kpc
is technically possible since the mass reconstruction uses
a parameterized lens modeling algorithm that assumes a
functional form for the cluster halo. The extrapolation
of the projected mass density to 500 kpc from the BCG
results in M(<500kpc) = 3 .6+0.8
−0.4×1014M⊙. We remind
the reader that since the lensing evidence all fall within
∼50 kpc of our BCG, it cannot constrain the outskirts
of the mass distribution; in fact it is common practice to
fix the truncation parameter ( rcut) of the cluster halo in
the lens modeling process for that reason. To gain a bet-
ter understanding of the statistical uncertainties of the
lens model, we re-ran the lens model with rcutfree, with
a prior of 250 < rcut<1500 kpc. The results of the free
truncation model are consistent with the fiducial lens
model. In particular, the mass within the strong lensing
regime, where strong lensing evidence is observed, was
unaffected. The statistical spread of the projected mass
density increased by ∼50% and the lower limit reduced
to∼2.5×1014M⊙, but it is likely still an underestimate
of the true uncertainty.
5.3. Revised Source Properties
In this section, we use our improved strong lensing
model to update the source galaxy measurements of K21
that depend on lensing magnification: luminosity, SFR,
and stellar mass ( M⋆). Other results from K21 that
are magnification-independent remain unchanged, e.g.,
metallicity, dust extinction, and specific SFR. K21 used
galfit modeling to measure the multi-band photometry
of the giant arc, and PROSPECTOR SED-fitting analysis
to determine the physical properties of the source. They
reported observed (i.e., before any magnification correc-
tion) star formation rate SFR 0-50 Myr = 913+380
−280M⊙yr−1
and stellar mass log( M⋆/M⊙) = 11 .63+0.19
−0.24. We fol-
lowed the methodology described in K21 to correct these
measurements by the lensing magnification, as follows.
For each measurement, we drew a random value from
its posterior distribution function and divided it by arandom value drawn from the distribution of average
arc magnifications. We repeated this process 10,000
times to obtain a statistical sampling and derived the
magnification-corrected source property and its uncer-
tainties from the resulting combined distribution. The
values that we report are the medians of these 10,000
samples with errors given by the difference between that
and the 84th or 16th percentile value. To verify that our
methodology is consistent with K21, we applied their
magnification to their SED results and confirmed that
we recover their demagnified results.
We then corrected the observed SFR and M⋆for the
magnification, in two ways. First, as was done in K21,
we correct the values by the average magnification of
the giant arc (see Section 4). Applying our magnifi-
cation, < µ arc>= 76+40
−20to the SED results, we ob-
tain magnification-corrected values of log( M⋆/M⊙) =
9.8±0.3 and SFR = 11 .4+7.4
−5.9M⊙yr−1. Our stellar mass
and SFR estimates are about 2.4 times smaller than the
ones found in K21 (log( M⋆/M⊙) = 10 .11+0.21
−0.26, SFR =
27+13
−9M⊙yr−1), using the same approach. Similarly, the
luminosity should be updated by the ratio of the magni-
fications, or a ∼0.92 mag change in the absolute mag-
nitude previously reported, to MUV=−21.28±0.2.
The reason for this discrepancy comes from the revised
magnification (Section 5.1), which scales directly with
luminosity, stellar mass, and SFR.
Second, we corrected the observed SFR and M⋆by
the flux-weighted magnification of the arc. The prox-
imity of the giant arc to the critical curve complicates
this measurement directly from the arc, as areas with
high flux occur near the critical curve where the mag-
nification and its uncertainties are high. Instead, we
take advantage of the relatively uniform magnification
of the counter image, which is not bisected by a critical
curve, and thus its flux-weighted magnification is ap-
proximately the same as its average magnification. The
flux ratio between the giant arc and its counter image is
the average flux-weighted magnification ratio. We pro-
ceeded as described below to obtain the flux ratio f,
and then calculated the flux-weighted magnification of
the giant arc as < µc.i.>×f.
The total observed flux of the arc and the counter im-
age were measured from the HST F814W data. Since
lensing is wavelength-invariant, the flux ratio should not
depend on the filter choice, but in the wavelength of
F814W the counter image is less contaminated by the
BCG. We make use of detailed galfit modeling of the
field that will be presented in a forthcoming paper by
Sierra et al. (in prep) and refer the reader to that pa-
per for details of the galfit modeling. In short, light
sources in a field of view of 10 .′′6×9.′′1 enclosing the arc10
and the counter image were modeled as two-dimensional
Sersic components, adding components iteratively to the
model until the residuals between the data and model
were consistent with the noise level. The resulting scene
decomposition allowed us to disentangle the arc and
the counter image from contamination from foreground
sources (e.g., the BCG light, and a blue source near con-
straint X1). The flux ratio between the giant arc and the
counter image is f= 14±0.9; the resulting flux-weighted
magnification of the giant arc is < µ arc,w >=92+37
−31.
Correcting the SFR and M⋆by the flux-weighted mag-
nification of the arc, we obtain SFR = 10 .3+7.0
−4.4M⊙yr−1
and log( M⋆/M⊙) = 9 .7±0.3, 2.6 and 2.8 times smaller
than previously reported by K21, respectively.
A revised measurement of the arc SED is beyond
the scope of this paper. The shallow, 4-band HST
imaging provide superior resolution to the ground-based
data, and a galfit analysis of these data will be pre-
sented elsewhere (Sierra et al., in prep). In future
work, we will combine the multi-band HST imaging de-
scribed here with forthcoming JWST imaging and spec-
troscopy to obtain a clump-by-clump analysis of the
lensed source. This future analysis will significantly su-
persede an HST+ground based measurement of the arc
as a whole, as it will extend farther into the IR, and
with greater depth and resolution.
As observed by K21, the magnification-corrected stel-
lar mass and star formation rate places COOL J1241
within the range of other 4 ≤z <6 galaxies from the
Santini et al. (2017) analysis of four Hubble Frontier
Fields. Santini et al. (2017) measured the slope and
intercept between stellar mass and star formation rate
in log-log space, in different redshift bins. They used
2σclipping to exclude outliers, and Monte Carlo sim-
ulation to correct for Eddington bias. Applying Equa-
tion 1 from Santini et al. (2017) to the measured mass of
COOL J1241 gives a predicted main sequence star for-
mation rate of log(SFR) MS= 2.06±0.13. Our measured
SFR is 5 σbelow the Eddington bias-corrected main se-
quence (MS) for 5 ≤z <6, although it falls within 1 −σ
of the MS in the 4 ≤z <5 bin. Since COOL J1241 falls
below the MS, it is consistent with a galaxy that has low
levels of SF relative to SFMS galaxies at z= 5, although
whether it is consistent with a post-starbust/quiescent
galaxy remains to be seen (with JWST/NIRSpec obser-
vations). Further studies imply that higher stellar mass
galaxies which fall below the main sequence experience
sudden quenching by AGN feedback while lower stellar
mass galaxies experience a slow decrease in SFR due to
gas exhaustion (Mancuso et al. 2016; Man et al. 2016).
Because COOL J1241 falls in the typical stellar mass
range for galaxies at 5 ≤z < 6, it is hard to predictwhich of these, if either, occurred. This invites a series
of questions: Did COOL J1241 ever look like the dust-
enshrouded early star-forming galaxies? Is AGN feed-
back responsible for the lack of dust in the galaxy or is
there evidence of gas exhaustion? Is the clumpiness that
we observe the result of a merger or another process? Is
there other evidence to suggest AGN feedback? While
these answers are outside of the scope of this paper,
our reported magnification values and deflection maps
facilitate further investigation of these questions. Our
analysis of COOL J1241 is an important stepping stone
for analysis of a galaxy observed close to the edge of the
Epoch of Reionization.
6.SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK
We used shallow, multi-band HST imaging to revise
the lens model of COOL J1241, a system with a z=
5.043 galaxy lensed by a z= 1.001 cluster into a bright
giant arc, first discovered by K21. The high spatial
resolution data reveal the clumpiness of the arc, en-
abling a detailed lens modeling of the system for the first
time. We confirm the candidate counter image identi-
fied by K21, and concur with their interpretation that
the brightest clump on the arc is a result of high magni-
fication under the critical curve. Other assumptions on
the lensing configuration from the ground-based analy-
sis, namely that the giant arc is formed by a common
three-image arc configuration, appear to be inconsistent
with the HST data. From the revised lensing analysis,
we report the following.
•We measure a projected mass density enclosed
within the Einstein radius of the lensing cluster
(θE= 5.′′77 for a source at z=5.043) of M(<
5.′′77) = 1 .079+0.023
−0.007×1013M⊙, consistent with an
analytical estimate assuming spherical symmetry
(Section 4).
•We compile information on Einstein radii and en-
closed mass of the five other known strong lensing
clusters at the same redshift range, either from the
literature, or estimate them directly from archival
HST data. We find that the Einstein radius, as
well as the enclosed mass of the COOL J1241 clus-
ter lens, are significantly lower than other known
lensing clusters at z≳1.
•We measure an average magnification of <
µarc>= 76+40
−20for the giant arc and < µc.i.>=
6.6+2.6
−2.2for the counter image, about a factor of
2.4+1.4
−0.7higher than the previous analysis of K21.
•We measure the flux-weighted average magnifi-
cation of the giant arc from the observed flux11
ratio between the arc and its counter image, <
µarc,w >=92+37
−31.
•We revise the magnification-dependent measure-
ments of K21 to account for the higher mag-
nification, by sampling from their PROSPECTOR
SED analysis posterior distribution function and
dividing by the flux-weighted lensing magnifica-
tion. We obtain magnification-corrected values
of log( M⋆/M⊙) = 9 .7±0.3 and SFR = 10 .3+7.0
−4.4
M⊙yr−1. The luminosity is similarly reduced by
the ratio of magnifications, to MUV=−21.28±
0.2.
•The stellar mass and star formation rate of
the lensed galaxy are within the range of other
5≤z <6 galaxies observed in the Hubble Fron-
tier Fields (Santini et al. 2017), falling significantly
below the log( SFR )−log(M⋆) main sequence (cor-
rected for Eddington Bias, Santini et al. 2017).
Imaging and spectroscopy of COOL J1241 with JWST
(Cycle 1 program ID 2566, PI Khullar; Khullar et al.
2021b) will be combined with the shallow multi-band
HST data presented in this work (HST Cycle 28 GO-
16484, PI Stark; Stark et al. 2020) to fully analyze the
lensed galaxy, on a clump-by-clump basis. These data
will also enable a high fidelity measurement of the giantarc and galaxy as a whole, after folding in our new and
improved understanding of the lensing configuration of
the giant arc. In future work, we will revise and improve
the lens model by identifying and refining our lensing
constraints using the JWST data. We expect that the
wider wavelength range will bring out color information
to which the HST filters are not sensitive.
