Abstract
Person Re-ID has been gaining a lot of attention and nowadays is of funda-
mental importance in many camera surveillance applications. The task consists of
identifying individuals across multiple cameras that have no overlapping views.
Most of the approaches require labeled data, which is not always available, given
the huge amount of demanded data and the difﬁculty of manually assigning a
class for each individual. Recently, studies have shown that re-ranking methods
are capable of achieving signiﬁcant gains, especially in the absence of labeled
data. Besides that, the fusion of feature extractors and multiple-source training
is another promising research direction not extensively exploited. We aim to ﬁll
this gap through a manifold rank aggregation approach capable of exploiting the
complementarity of different person Re-ID rankers. In this work, we perform
a completely unsupervised selection and fusion of diverse ranked lists obtained
from multiple and diverse feature extractors. Among the contributions, this work
proposes a query performance prediction measure that models the relationship
among images considering a hypergraph structure and does not require the use of
any labeled data. Expressive gains were obtained in four datasets commonly used
for person Re-ID. We achieved results competitive to the state-of-the-art in most
of the scenarios.

Person Re-ID is of critical importance in the majority of modern security and
surveillance applications [1–4]. The task consists in, given a query image of one
person, to identify the same individual across different cameras which have no
overlapping views. There are many difﬁculties for Re-ID retrieval [5], among
them: (i)different viewpoints, (ii)possible low-image resolutions, (iii)illumina-
tion changes, (iv)occlusions, (v)difﬁculty of manually labeling data for training,
(vi)large amount of data to be processed. The challenge of improving the effec-
tiveness of these systems, especially in open-world scenarios, has attracted a lot
of research efforts from the scientiﬁc community [4–6].
Initially, person Re-ID retrieval systems were mainly based on the use of hand-
crafted feature representations [7–15]. Besides that, other strategies commonly
used to generic image retrieval, like bag of visual words [13, 16], have also been
employed. Aiming at further improving the quality of the results, rather than
using traditional distance measures, researchers have proposed metric learning
approaches for Re-ID [11, 17–20], most of them based on supervised models.
In [6], an extensive evaluation of multiple combinations of feature extractors and
metric learning approaches is discussed.
Due to the signiﬁcant impact of deep learning on common image retrieval and
machine learning [5], the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) also have gained
a lot of attention and have been widely employed to solve Re-ID tasks in the recent
years [5, 21–29]. Among the works, existing networks have been trained for Re-
ID [30, 31], and some new architectures have been proposed solely focusing on
Re-ID [21–25].
Despite the success of deep learning, one of the main difﬁculties resides in
the lack of large publicly available Re-ID datasets for training [5], mainly be-
2cause manually labeling images is a very difﬁculty task, especially in open-world
scenarios [6], where the datasets may increase dynamically. In order to mitigate
this problem, many authors have proposed multi-source training, which consists
in joining multiple available datasets for training [26, 32, 33], usually increasing
the network capacity for generalization.
However, despite several advances in multi-source approaches, it is inevitable
the need for intensive manual annotation for obtaining training data. In practice,
the demand for extensive training data restricts the generalization and scalability
of supervised approaches, especially on person Re-ID tasks, which are not only
resource-intensive to acquire identity annotation but also impractical for large-
scale data [34, 35].
Usually, there are two main steps associated to Re-ID labeling process [5, 36,
37]:(i)intra-camera annotation that requires to compare a person with all the other
unlabeled persons in a single camera with multiple views; and (ii)inter-camera
that requires to match a person across different cameras with multiple views. Let P
be the number of persons and Sthe number of camera views. The intra-camera an-
notation complexity is O(SP2)and inter-camera annotation complexity ranges
from O(SP2)andO(S2P2). The worst case of inter-camera occurs because
not all persons appear in every camera view in the majority of cases, which makes
the association requiring to repeat for all Vcamera views [36, 37]. Commonly,
inter-camera association signiﬁcantly increases standard annotation costs. There
are approaches that mitigate these issues; among them there is the Intra-Camera
Supervised (ICS) [36, 37], Multi-Task Multi-Label (MATE) [36, 37], and Cross-
camera Feature Prediction [38], which were recently proposed.
Due to the challenge of obtaining large amounts of strongly labeled data, semi-
supervised methods have been employed, which is a typical strategy for supervi-
sion minimization. Based on information learned from a small set of labeled data,
3the idea is to generate labels from unlabeled training data. Some research has been
made in this direction [39–42]. However, these methods often suffer from perfor-
mance degradation and often require a large proportion of expensive cross-view
pairwise labeling [36].
There are also weakly supervised strategies that replace accurate labels with
inaccurate annotations. In [43], the authors proposed the idea of obtaining multi-
ple bounding boxes of the same person from untrimmed videos. This is done by
training a deep learning model capable of extracting multiple bounding boxes of
the same person in a video. Recently, [44] proposed to replace image-level anno-
tations with bag-level annotations. Weakly supervised Re-ID is very challenging,
since it is rather difﬁcult to model the considerable variances across camera views
(e.g. occlusion and illumination) without using strong label data [36, 43].
As an alternative solution, unsupervised approaches [34, 35, 45–51] have been
attracting a lot of attention from the research community, especially because,
once labeled data are not required, the methods become more suitable for real-
world scenarios. In a promising research direction, to address the lack of labels
issue, there are works proposed to post-process person Re-ID results by analyzing
similarity relationships encoded in the datasets. Several authors have proposed
unsupervised re-ranking approaches for Re-ID [52–60]. In [52], the original dis-
tances among images are improved by calculating Jaccard correlation scores of
each ranked list. Various approaches exploit the reciprocal neighborhood infor-
mation and other co-occurrence indexes aiming at improving the ranking results.
Another strategy commonly employed on generic unsupervised image retrieval
and few exploited on Re-ID tasks consists in fusion approaches [61]. In general,
the both broad categories of fusion have been successfully used in generic image
retrieval: (i)early fusion, which combines the feature vectors; and (ii)late fu-
sion, which usually combines ranked lists. Signiﬁcant results have been achieved
4based on fusion of different ranked lists and features [62, 63], with the purpose of
obtaining more effective results by exploiting the complementarity of each input.
On person Re-ID tasks, some authors have proposed late fusion strategies
based on rank aggregation [64, 65]. In [65], the aggregation is performed by
attributing weights for each query of each ranker, but no pre-selection of features
is performed, and all the features are used as input for the fusion step. There
are also early fusion approaches for Re-ID, as [66], that propose a supervised
multi-hypergraph fusion model for early fusion of feature extractors. It learns a
hypergraph for each feature through a star expansion strategy and they are fused
according to weights that the method has learned from training. In [67], a hyper-
graph structure is used with a deep learning model to improve the performance of
the acquired features for Re-ID.
Although fusing different features can represent a signiﬁcant advantage due to
extra information available, how to choose what features to fuse can be a challeng-
ing task. Even for supervised approaches, selecting high-effective combinations
of visual features remains a complex task, since it is necessary to consider various
aspects, such as diversity and complementarity of results. Therefore, selecting
features in an unsupervised way, without any labeled data is even more challeng-
ing, since no information about the effectiveness of individual visual features is
available.
This paper addresses the challenging task of unsupervised selection and fu-
sion of different features for more effective person re-identiﬁcation. We propose
a novel Hypergraph Rank Selection and Fusion (HRSF) framework, which com-
bines an unsupervised rank-based formulation for feature selection [62] with a
robust hypergraph model [68] for query performance prediction and rank aggre-
gation based on manifold learning. Among our main contributions, we can high-
light:
5• The proposed HRSF framework uses a rank-based late fusion model, suit-
able for selection and fusion of a broad diversity of features. The selection
is performed by exploiting an unsupervised measure for query performance
prediction;
• A hypergraph rank-based formulation is used to encode the high-order rela-
tionship among images. This strategy is exploited for both selection and fu-
sion tasks. Hypergraph models were little exploited in Re-ID literature [66,
67];
• The proposed technique is able to learn representations through the hyper-
graph structure that encodes multiple features from different rankers. The
manifold learning based on a hypergraph model [68] allows effective fusion
and ﬁnal ranking. In addition, our approach innovates by fusing different
feature extractors trained on different datasets;
• Different from most of fusion approaches for Re-ID which often consider
ad hoc selections or combine all the features of the input set [64, 65, 67],
our approach is capable of dealing with various features in a completely un-
supervised scenario, selecting combinations in a very large search space. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work which performs an explicit
selection and subsequently fusion of features on person Re-ID tasks in a
completely unsupervised way.
In fact, the proposed Hypergraph Rank Selection and Fusion (HRSF) approach
is based on both [62] and [68]. However, while there are some aspects in common,
also there are crucial differences. Among them, we can mention:
•The problem of selecting and fusing rankers in unsupervised scenar-
ios is very challenging. Hence, the use of an effective algorithm for
6selection is fundamental . While USRF [62] employs traditional query
performance prediction approaches (Authority and Reciprocal scores), we
propose a new measure named Hypergraph Query Performance Prediction
(HQPP);
• Originally, USRF [62] uses the CPRR [69] as a method for fusion tasks.
Differently, the proposed HRSF uses the LHRR [68] method, which in com-
bination with the HQPP, makes both the selection and fusion based on
hypergraph structures. The LHRR [68] method is also more robust than
the CPRR [69], achieving superior retrieval results in most datasets;
• Both [62] and [68] were originally proposed and evaluated only on general
purpose image retrieval scenarios. The proposed HRSF is employed and
validated for person Re-ID tasks;
• In unsupervised scenarios, the optimal neighborhood size ( kparameters)
can be challenging to deﬁne. The experiments revealed that HRSF is more
robust than HQPP to different neighborhood sizes , leading to the most
effective results in the majority of scenarios.
A wide experimental evaluation was conducted on 4 different datasets with
sizes ranging from 14,097 to 39,902 images. Up to 28 different rankers where
considered in each case, resulting in millions of possible combinations. Experi-
ments indicated that our approach was capable of selecting and fusing the rankers,
achieving high-effective results superior to all rankers in isolation and competitive
to state-of-the-art, when more than 20 recent Re-ID approaches are considered.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses a for-
mal deﬁnition of problem setting. Section 3 presents the proposed rank selection
and fusion for Re-ID. Section 4 discusses the conducted experimental evaluation
and, ﬁnally, Section 5 presents our conclusions.
72. Problem Formulation
This section presents the formal deﬁnition of the rank model used in this work.
LetC=fx1;x2; :::; xNgbe an image collection, where Ndenotes the collection
size. Let us consider a retrieval task where, given a query image, returns a list of
images from the collection C.
Formally, given a query image xq, a ranker denoted by Rjcomputes a ranked
listtq=(x1,x2,:::,xk)in response to the query. The ranked list tqcan be deﬁned
as a permutation of the k-neighborhood set N(q;k), which contains the kmost
similar images to image xqin the collection C. The permutation tqis a bijection
from the set N(q;k)onto the set [k] =f1;2;:::; kg. Thetq(i)notation denotes the
position of image xiin the ranked list tq.
The ranker Rjcan be deﬁned based on diverse approaches, including feature
extraction or learning methods. In this paper, a feature-based approach is consid-
ered, deﬁning Ras a tuple (e;r), where e:C!Rdis a function that extracts a
feature vector vxfrom an image x2C; and d:RdRd!Ris a distance function
that computes the distance between two images according to their corresponding
feature vectors. Formally, the distance between two images xi;xjis deﬁned by
r(e(xi),e(xj)). The notation r(i;j)is used for readability purposes.
A ranked list can be computed by sorting images in a crescent order of dis-
tance. In terms of ranking positions we can say that, if image xiis ranked before
image xjin the ranked list of image xq, that is, tq(i)<tq(j), then r(q;i)r(q;j).
Taking every image in the collection as a query image xq, a set of ranked lists T
=ft1;t2; :::;tNgcan be obtained.
Different features and distance functions give rises to different rankers which,
in turn, produce distinct ranked lists. Let R=fR1,R2;:::,Rmgbe a set of rankers
andRj2R, we denote by Tjthe set of ranked lists produced by Rj. A ranked list
computed by the ranker Rjin response to a query xqis denoted by tj;q.
8Our proposed method (HRSF) intends to select the most effective rankers from
Rbased on their respective set of ranked lists, without the need of any labeled
data. The selection function ( fs) is formally deﬁned by Equation (1).

3. Unsupervised Hypergraph Rank Selection and Fusion
This paper proposes a framework named Hypergraph Rank Selection and Fu-
sion (HRSF) for unsupervised person Re-ID tasks. Our model is inspired by a
recent approach [62] proposed for rank selection and fusion on general image re-
trieval tasks. The method is based on effectiveness estimations and correlation
among features computed by a rank-based analysis. In [62], reciprocal references
are exploited for effectiveness estimation and feature selection, while rank corre-
lation measures are used for analyzing complementary and diversity aspects. The
selected features are fused through a rank-based similarity learning method [69].
The proposed approach differs from previous work [62] on four main aspects:
(i) the unsupervised measure used to estimate the quality of individual features,
which is based on hypergraph structures; ( ii) a more robust method to fuse the
selected features; ( iii) the proposed approach is evaluated and validated for person
Re-ID and; ( iv) it is more robust to different neighborhood sizes, leading to the
most effective results in the majority of scenarios. We innovate by employing a
robust hypergraph model for both tasks: query performance prediction and rank
fusion. A recent manifold learning approach based on a rank-based hypergraph
formulation [68] is exploited.

10The hyperedges weights, used for estimating the conﬁdence of hyperedge as-
sociations, are exploited in our approach to predict the effectiveness of the dif-
ferent person Re-ID rankers in an unsupervised fashion. Additionally, we use a
manifold learning algorithm for fusion tasks, the Log-based Hypergraph of Rank-
ing References (LHRR) [68]. This keeps our approach completely unsupervised,
and more robust, mostly based on hypergraph structures.
Figure 1 presents an overview of the proposed approach, where the main steps
are illustrated and numerated. Given a set of different rankers provided by diverse
features extractors and distance measures, (1) a hypergraph estimation measure is
employed in order to predict the performance of each ranker without using data
labels. In (2), a correlation measure is applied for each pair of rankers. The com-
puted measures are used in the equation presented in the step (3), which computes
the equation for each combination. The rankers selected in stage (3) are fused in
stage (4), which uses LHRR [68] for rank aggregation.
3.1. Unsupervised Ranker Selection
Given a set of available rankers for person Re-ID and no labeled data, we aim
to select a combination which produces the most effective results. The selection
measure proposed on [62] relies on the idea that rankers can be analyzed in pairs
using an effectiveness estimator and a correlation measure. It consists in attribut-
ing a weight to each pair ( wp), in such way that, the ones composed by the most
effective rankers and the highest/lowest correlated ones should receive a higher
score. This is presented in Equation (2).

Prediction (HQPP), which is described in Section 3.2. While the effectiveness
can be individually estimated for each ranker, the correlation measure is applied
to pairs. The exponent bcan be employed to decide if the selection favors the
most correlated or diverse rankers. We adopt b= 1, since in [62] it was used for
scenarios with a higher number of features.
Therefore, in our approach, a ranker pair is selected based on the score ob-
tained by wp. All ranker pairs are ranked according to wp(in descending order).
Only the pairs with the highest scores are selected. The user can choose the num-
ber of top combinations to be selected.
After the selection of a pair of rankers, which is denoted by X
2, combinations
of other sizes are selected by performing intersection and union operations, in a
12procedure detailed described in [62].
For computing the correlation between rankers, the Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) [70]
measure is used. This measure considers the overlap between top- klists at increas-
ing depths. The weight of the overlap is calculated based on probabilities deﬁned
at each depth. It can be formally deﬁned as follows:
l(ti;tj;k;a) = ( 1 a)k
å
d=1ad 1jN(i;k)\N(j;k)j
d; (3)
where N(i;k)denotes the natural neighborhood of the top- kimages for xianda
is a constant ( a=0:9 was used for all the experiments).
In this work, rather than the effectiveness estimations and the fusion method
employed in [62], we used a query performance prediction measure (HQPP) and a
recent manifold ranking aggregation method (LHRR) that model the ranked lists
through hypergraph structures [68]. Both are discussed in the next sub-sections.
3.2. Hypergraph Query Performance Prediction
Query Performance Prediction (QPP) can be broadly deﬁned as the task of
estimating the effectiveness of a search/retrieval operation performed in response
to a query, where no labeled data is available [71]. Initially proposed for textual
retrieval systems [72, 73], the task assumed a diversiﬁed taxonomy in the literature
and has been establishing as a promising approach in image retrieval systems [74].
In this work, we propose to use a Hypergraph Query Performance Prediction
(HQPP) score for predicting the effectiveness of rankings produced by Person
Re-ID features. The HQPP score uses a hypergraph formulation recently pro-
posed [68] for manifold ranking on multimedia retrieval. Hypergraphs are a ro-
bust generalization of graphs, providing a powerful tool for capturing high-order
relationships in several domains [75–77]. In opposition to traditional graph-based
approaches, which represent only pairwise relationships, hypergraphs allow con-
13necting any number of nodes in order to represent similarity among sets of ob-
jects [78].
This work and the HQPP score use a hypergraph model mainly based on the
following main hypotheses and ideas:
• Similar objects present similar ranked lists and, therefore, similar hyper-
edges. Once the hyperedges are represented by an incidence matrix, the
product of the hyperedges can be exploited to compute a more effective
similarity measure between nodes;
• Similar objects are expected to reference each other in the same hyperedge.
Therefore, hyperedges that concentrate a high number of ranking references
on a few nodes are expected to be more effective. The Hypergraph Query
Performance Prediction (HQPP) is formally deﬁned based on this conjec-
ture.
Following the deﬁnition of [68], a hypergraph can be deﬁned as a tuple HG=
(V;E;hp), where Vrepresents a set of vertices and Edenotes the hyperedge set.
The set of hyperedges Ecan be deﬁned as a family of subsets of Vsuch that
S
e2E=V. To each hyperedge ei, a positive score hp(ei)denotes the conﬁdence
of relationships among a set of vertices established by the hyperedge ei.
While graphs are commonly represented by adjacency matrices, hypergraphs
are often represented by incidence matrices. The incidence of a hyperedge eion a
vertice vjis represented by an incidence matrix H, deﬁned as follows:
h(ei;vj) =8
<
:r(ei;vj);ifvj2ei;
0; otherwise,(4)
where h(ei;vj)denotes the reliance of the vertex vjto belong to a hyperedge ei
andr(ei;vj)is a function with a codomain in the R+that indicates the degree to
14which the vertex vjbelongs to a hyperedge ei. A hyperedge eiis deﬁned for each
image xi2Cbased on the k-neighborhood set of xiand its respective neighbors.
In this context, the function r(ei;vj)is deﬁned based on the density of ranking
references to vjin the ranking of xiand its neighbors. Formally, the function is
deﬁned as:
r(ei;vj) = å
y2N(i;k)^j2N(y;k)hr(i;y)hr(y;j);(5)
where hr(i;x)is a function that assigns a weight of relevance to image xaccording
to its position in the ranked list ti. The weight assigned to xaccording to its
position in the ranked list tiis deﬁned as follows:
hr(i;x) =1 logkti(x): (6)
The size of the hyperedges varies according to the number of co-occurrence
of images. A high diversity of elements may indicate a high degree of uncertainty
and this information will be exploited for deﬁning the weights of hyperedges. The
weight of a hyperedge hp(ei)denotes the conﬁdence of relationships established
among vertices by the hyperedge.
In order to compute the weight hp(ei), we use the Hypergraph Neighborhood
SetNh, which contains the kvertices with the greatest h(ei;)scores in the hyper-
edge ei. As such, the hyperedge weight hp(ei)is deﬁned as:
hp(ei) =å
j2Nh(i;k)h(i;j): (7)
A high-effective hyperedge is expected to present an elevated value of hp, in-
dicating a consistent co-occurrence of the same elements with high conﬁdence
of membership. Therefore, the hyperedge weight hp(ei)is deﬁned as the Hyper-
15graph Query Performance Prediction (HQPP) for ranked list of image xi, which is
denoted by g:
g(ti) =hp(ei): (8)
For a given ranker Ri, thegcan be computed for all the ranked lists to obtain
the value of g(Ri)in Equation (2). We highlight that, HQPP was used to deﬁne gin
this work, but our approach is ﬂexible and capable of supporting other measures.
3.3. Hypergraph Manifold Rank Aggregation
Once the person Re-ID features are selected, we fuse the respective produced
rankings through a recently proposed manifold learning algorithm [68]. The Log-
based Hypergraph of Ranking References (LHRR) [68], brieﬂy described in this
section, captures the dataset manifold structure through a hypergraph-based simi-
larity measure, which can be used to rank aggregation tasks.
LHRR [68] exploits the hypergraph formulation discussed in the last section
to represent high-order similarity relationships encoded in the dataset manifold.
Subsequently, pairwise similarity scores are computed, allowing more effective
ranking results. The pairwise similarity is computed based on the conjecture that
similar elements present similar hyperedge representations. The similarity be-
tween hyperedges is computed based on the product of the incidence matrix H
and its transpose to encode reciprocal relationship. A pairwise similarity matrix S
is computed as:
S= (HHT)(HTH) (9)
In addition to the product of hyperedges, a Cartesian product operation is con-
ducted to extract useful pairwise relationships direct from the set of elements de-
ﬁned by the hyperedges. Given two hyperedges eq;ei2E, the Cartesian product
between them can be deﬁned as:
16eqei=f(vx;vy):vx2eq^vy2eig: (10)
Leteq2denote the Cartesian product between the elements of the same hyper-
edge eq, for each pair of vertices (vi;vj)2eq2a pairwise similarity relationship
cpis computed to deﬁne the membership degrees of viandvj. The function is
formally deﬁned as:
cp(eq;vi;vj) =hp(eq)h(eq;vi)h(eq;vj): (11)
A similarity measure based on Cartesian product is deﬁned through a matrix
C, with each position computed as follows:
c(i;j) = å
eq2E^(vi;vj)2eq2cp(vi;vj): (12)
The pairwise similarity deﬁned based on hyperedges and Cartesian product
operations provides complementary information. Hence, an afﬁnity matrix Wis
computed by combining both matrices as:
W=CS: (13)
Based on the afﬁnity measure deﬁned by W, a ranking procedure can be per-
formed for each feature giving rise to a new set of ranked lists. Next, a multiplica-
tive rank-based formulation is used to combine the features, exploiting an adaptive
weight, which is assigned to each query/feature according to the weight of the re-
spective hyperedge. Let hfdenote the fused afﬁnity measure; each element is
computed as follows considering the top- Lpositions of tq:
hf(q;i) =m
Õ
f=1(1+hp(f;eq))
(1+logLtq;f(i)); (14)
17where hp(f;eq)is the weight of hyperedge eqaccording to the feature fandtq;f(i)
denote the position of xiin the ranked list of xqaccording to the feature f. The
combined afﬁnity measure hf(;)gives rise to a unique set of ranked lists which
is re-processed by the LHRR [68] algorithm as a single feature.
4. Experimental Evaluation
This section presents the experimental results conducted for evaluating our
proposed approach. The experimental evaluation was conducted on 4 datasets of-
ten used for person Re-ID with sizes ranging from 14,097 to 39,902. For each
dataset, up to 28 rankers were considered of different modalities (e.g. traditional
descriptors, bag of visual words, deep learning). The large number of rankers is
used with the objective of evaluating the capacity of our selection approach. It is
desirable that, if the selection is accurate, only the most effective are selected to
be fused. Also, there is a very large number of possible combinations, when all
the possible sizes are considered. With 28 rankers, there are 268,435,456 possible
combinations. Since it is impractical to execute all of them, selection is of funda-
mental importance in this context. The experimental evaluation also considers a
comparison with fusion baselines and with state-of-the-art Re-ID approaches.
4.1. Experimental Protocol
Our experimental protocol considers 4 datasets, which are detailed in Table 2.
For CUHK03 [15], we considered the detected version of the dataset, which uses
the bounding boxes extracted by a DPM detector, and adopted the experimental
protocol proposed by [52]. Both Market1501 [13] and DukeMTMC [79] use the
experimental protocol proposed by the original authors that published the datasets.
In the case of the Airport [6], a different protocol was adopted, where all the
images (training, probe, and gallery) are considered as queries (probes) and part of
the gallery at the same time. For all of them, the MAP (Mean Average Precision)
18was reported. The R1 corresponds to the ﬁrst value of the CMC (Cumulative
Matching Characteristics) curve, which indicates the number of ranked lists that
have an image that corresponds to the same individual in the ﬁrst position after
the query image. All the evaluations are single-shot (single-query), this means
that each query corresponds to only one image.

Table 3 presents all the descriptors used in the experimental evaluation (i.e., as
the input of our method). The number of rankers per dataset ranges from 21 to 28,
and emcompasses different modalities (e.g. statistical, bag of visual words, deep
learning). For most of the extractions, the Euclidean distance was considered,
no metric learning was applied aiming at keeping the protocol fully unsupervised
(not using the labels from the dataset being evaluated). Except for OSNET-AIN,
where cosine distance was used, as done in [22]. For the non-deep methods (GBI-
COV , LOMO, GOG, WHOS, ELF, HLBP, SDC, and BOVW), we applied PCA to
reduce the feature vectors to 100 dimensions before the distances were extracted,
as also done by other authors [6]. In total, we considered 7 different Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN): MobileNetV2, RESNET50, HACNN, MLFN, OSNET,
OSNET-IBN, and OSNET-AIN. For each of these models, three different trainings
were performed: on Market dataset, which is indicated by (M); on DukeMTMC
dataset, which is indicated by (D); and on MSMT17 dataset, which is indicated by
(MT). Different trainings and models were used with the objective of evaluating
our selection and fusion. Most of them were pre-trained on the ImageNet [80]
19dataset, except HACNN which was trained on Re-ID datasets from scratch. The
MSMT17 [81] was used to train some of the networks, since it is a large dataset
(126,441 images of 4,101 people in 15 cameras) that can facilitate the capacity of
generalization. The majority of the networks were trained considering only the
training subset, but RESNET50 and OSNET variants used all of the images (train,
probe, and gallery) when trained on MSMT17. The CNN features were extracted
with the Torchreid [82] trained weights1.
To keep the comparisons fair, since our evaluation is unsupervised, the
models that were trained on the target dataset were not used. For example,
train on Market and test on Market is removed. These cases are reported with
“—”.
4.2. Experimental Analysis
The neighborhood size, denoted by k, is used in multiple steps of our method:
for calculating the effectiveness measure, for the correlation measure, and in the
fusion stage. Figure 2 presents an experiment that was conducted to evaluate the
impact of kon Market1501 dataset, where both R1 and MAP are shown for dif-
ferent values of k. Notice that the method is robust to different parameter settings.
We used k=20 for CUHK03, Market1501, DukeMTMC and k=10 for Airport
in all of the remaining experiments. For the Airport dataset, a smaller kseems to
be more adequate, since it has less images per individual (around 4) compared to
the other collections.
In this work, HQPP is proposed as a measure to estimate the quality of each
ranker in the selection stage. Aiming at assessing the use of this measure in Re-ID
scenarios, Figure 3 shows an experiment where each dot corresponds to a different
ranker and the MAP (measure that uses labeled data) is compared to the HQPP

The HRSF ranks the best combinations for each size. The user can choose
the number of top combinations to be selected. We conducted an experiment on
22CUHK03, Market, and DukeMTMC (Figures 4, 5, and 6) where the average MAP
and R1 of the selected ranker pairs is presented as the number of selected pairs
changes. Notice that the highest MAP and R1 values are in the ﬁrst position (top-
1), which evinces that the combination with the highest wp(ranked in the ﬁrst
position) is also the one with highest effectiveness.

Additionally, in all cases the proposed selection and fusion achieves better re-
sults the the best ranker in isolation . The complementarity among the methods
can be exploited by our approach achieving gains up to +47% (MAP) after the
selection and fusion is performed. The results also indicate that gains can be ob-
tained when networks trained on different datasets are combined, even when the
same architecture is used.

254.3. Comparison with Fusion Baselines
In order to evaluate the proposed method compared to other approaches that
both select and fuse the input features, Table 5 presents the proposed approach,
HRSF, compared to both early and late fusion baselines on the four datasets. In
all the cases, the same set of features, which were presented in the experimental
protocol, were used. For the early fusion methods, the default parameters were
used and all the features were processed with PCA to reduce the feature vectors
to 100 components. From all the features, the top-1000 were selected to compose
the new feature vector and the Euclidean distance was computed. As can be seen,
the results of our approach are superior in most cases (CUHK03, Market1501,
Airport) and comparable in others (DukeMTMC).

26An experiment was conducted with the objective of clarifying the robustness
of HRSF to different values of kwhen compared to USRF. Figures 7 and 8 present
the MAP of the best combination ( X) among top-5 for different values of kon
Market and Duke datasets, respectively. The MAP for k=20 is the same of Ta-
ble 5. Notice that, while both methods seem comparable for k=20,our method
provided a signiﬁcant higher MAP for other values of k.This is fundamental
for unsupervised scenarios, where the optimal kcan be challenging to deﬁne.

274.4. State-of-the-Art
This section presents comparisons with recent baselines. The taxonomy often
varies in the literature; some of the subcategories of unsupervised Re-ID methods
are: ( i)Cross-domain Methods: they are trained on one (single-source) or more
(multi-source) labeled source domains. The evaluation is conducted on the target
dataset. It can be understood as a type of transfer learning; ( ii)Domain Adaptive
Methods: they use cross-domain training and perform a second step (adaptation)
using unlabeled data from the target domain.
However, since they are all unsupervised and often there is overlap among the
categories, we insert all of them into a single group named Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation Methods [85]. Table 6 presents our results compared to around 20
state-of-the-art Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Methods [85] .
In order to perform a fair comparison, it contains only methods that did not
use the labels from the target dataset for training (train on CUHK03 and test
on CUHK03 is not used, for example). Therefore, supervised and semi-supervised
methods are not included. The abbreviations in parentheses indicate the datasets
used for training2. For example, the use of (D, M) indicates that the reported result
corresponds to a training done either on Duke or on Market dataset. The results
reported on Market were trained on Duke and the results reported on Duke were
trained on Market. None of the presented methods were trained using labels
from the target dataset. The abbreviations were omitted for baselines that used
more than 5 datasets as source for training (CAMEL [33] and baseline by [26]),
but they can be consulted in [26], which used similar baselines and protocol.
We provided the best results for each method (considering the original papers)
with the objective of keeping the evaluation as far as possible. Since the code and
2C02 = CUHK02, C03 = CUHK03, M = Market1501, D = DukeMTMC, MT = MSMT17
28implementation are not available for the majority of methods, it is not possible to
provide results considering the same sources in all cases.
Both MAP and R1 are reported in all the cases and our best results are pre-
sented in bold. The baselines do not perform any form of selection. We highlight
that our method receives all the rankers as input and performs a wide selection
among rankers with high and low effectiveness, which is a very challenging sce-
nario. In contrast, none of the baselines are required to perform any selection
and the features are chosen manually. The selection stage is an important aspect
and contribution of HRSF that it is hard to replicate in the baselines. Notice
that our approach achieved competitive or superior results for all the evaluated
datasets.
With the objective to facilitate the visualization of the best results in the state-
of-the-art, Table 7 presents the rank of the methods according to MAP and R1.
The gray cells with bold values correspond to methods that have achieved a higher
rank than HRSF in each case. Our method achieved the best MAP on DukeMTMC
and had the second position in the other two datasets. For R1, HRSF is positioned
among the top-4 in all cases. The mean of the rank on each dataset is presented in
the most right columns. Notice that our method achieved one of the highest rank
means among all of the methods, being only slightly behind ISSDA [86]. The
comparisons show that, besides our results being among the best for all datasets,
in some cases, other non-fusion based methods provided higher values than our
approach. There are some possible explanations for this:
• Each dataset has different aspects (e.g., image resolution, picture angles,
environment, number of images per person, dataset size). For this reason,
different methods may perform better or worse on distinct datasets ;
• The Baseline by [26] performs a multi-source training. The results reported
by [26] are based on the transfer learning of a training performed on 7 Re-
29ID datasets . It considers, by far, the largest labeled source of all the base-
lines , which leads to high results, especially on Market where it is ranked
as the 2nd/3rd best R1/MAP (shown in Table 7);
• An idea that is exploited by some baselines is the generation of pseudo-
labels. The most promising example is ISSDA [86], which has the best
results on Market and is well ranked on DukeMTMC. Different from the
others, ISSDA employs a self-supervised iterative pseudo-label generation
and training. However, besides the effectiveness, the authors [86] claim
that the training stage is very time-consuming since it requires, among
other aspects, the execution of a clustering algorithm. Furthermore, ISSDA
has an average ranking of 1.5 against 1.67 of our method (Table 7, MAP
measure); However, ISSDA does not report results on CUHK03. Our
average ranking without considering CUHK03 is also 1.5 ;
• The MAR [47] performs soft label generation . The applied strategy is ca-
pable of achieving promising results for improving the DukeMTMC dataset
with R1 measure. However, apparently, the quality of the soft labels varies
according to the dataset.
Since the proposed method is ﬂexible, among future works, we intend to ex-
pand our approach by exploiting the use of pseudo-labels. This can be done by
modifying HRSF or by providing methods like ISSDA [86] and MAR [47] as
input, for example. In this work, only the rankers in Table 3 were used.

4.5. Visual Results
Some qualitative results were also elaborated to evince the quality of our ob-
tained results. Two different queries ( x1,x2) for the same person (ID) were chosen
32from the DukeMTMC dataset. Figure 9 presents a graph for each ranker that com-
poses the best combination ( X) on DukeMTMC and the HRSF result. Each dot
represents a gallery image, which is positioned in the graph according to its dis-
tance to the query images ( x1,x2). The idea is that, since the query images are of
the same person, the distance between them should be small and the images of the
same ID should be closer to the bottom left corner. Images obtained from different
camera views are presented in different symbols. It shows that the HRSF method
was capable of reducing the distance of all the images belonging to the same class
when compared to isolated rankers (OSNET, OSNET-IBN, OSNET-AIN).

obtained by HRSF ( X) and the rankers that compose it. The query image is
presented with green borders, and the wrong results with red borders. Notice that,
33in these cases, beyond selecting the best results, our approach was also capable of
removing most of the incorrectly retrieved images.

5. Conclusion
In this work, we have presented an approach to select and aggregate results
from different Re-ID methods without using the target dataset training labels. The
relationship among the dataset elements is modeled using hypergraph structures
both for query performance prediction and fusion. In most of the cases, the best
rankers were properly selected and fused. Our approach achieved signiﬁcant gains
in the majority of the scenarios and results competitive or superior to the state-of-
the-art, including the most recent methods.
35As future work, we intend to investigate the use of the proposed approach
in multi-query scenarios and further expand the experimental protocol, including
other datasets and feature extractors. Another idea is to expand our approach
by exploiting the use of pseudo-labels. Our method, as currently presented, is
ready to be executed in scenarios that do not require real time. In addition, we
intend to address these real time scenarios in future work, where optimizations
and parallelization techniques can be employed.
