According to Thermodynamics, the eﬃciency of a heat engine i s upper bounded by Carnot eﬃ-
ciency. For macroscopic systems, the Carnot eﬃciency is, ho wever, achieved only for quasi static
processes. And, considerable attention has been paid to pro vide general evaluation of the eﬃciency
at a ﬁnite speed. Recently, several upper bounds of the eﬃcie ncy have been derived in the context
of the trade-oﬀ among the eﬃciency, power, and other quantit ies such as the ﬂuctuation of power.
Here, we show universal lower and upper bounds of the eﬃcienc y from the thermodynamic uncer-
tainty relations for the entropy production and for the heat transfers. The lower bound is charac-
terized by the ratio between the ﬂuctuation of the irreversi ble entropy production and mean output
work. The upper bound of the eﬃciency is described by a genera lized precision of the heat trans-
fers among the working substance, and hot and cold reservoir s. We explicitly derive necessary and
suﬃcient conditions of both the lower and upper bounds in a un iﬁed manner in terms of ﬂuctuation
theorem. Hence, our result provides an operating principle of the heat engine.
Introduction.— According to thermodynamics, the ef-
ﬁciency of a heat engine ηgiven as the ratio between the
input heat absorption and the output work is universally
upperboundedbyCarnoteﬃciency ηC. SincetheCarnot
eﬃciency is achieved only for quasi static processes for
macroscopic systems, it is one of the most challenging
problems to know the fundamental operating principle
of the heat engines for general classical and quantum
nonequilibrium systems including the molecular junction
and nanowire[1]. Therefore, considerable attention has
been paid to some general trade-oﬀ relations between the
eﬃciency and power. In particular, several explicit up-
per bounds of the eﬃciency at ﬁnite speed have been
obtained beyond the linear response regime[2–5]. Fur-
thermore, it has been pointed out that the ﬂuctuation
of the power is also a relevant quantity for the trade-
oﬀ relation[4, 5] for operation of steady state mesoscopic
heatengines. Hence, the stochasticthermodynamicspro-
vides a comprehensive framework for this issue.
On the other hand, the universal lower bound of the
eﬃciency is still lacking. Such a lower bound of the ef-
ﬁciency is of fundamental interest for example to design
a high-performance heat engine. In this Letter, as a ﬁrst
step toward this direction, we show universal lower and
upper bounds of the eﬃciency ηof autonomous heat en-
gines in terms of Carnot eﬃciency ηCand the ﬂuctua-
tion of the entropy production caused by the heat ﬂow-
ing among the working substance and reservoirs from
thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs)[6–9](see
Ref.[10] for review) for the entropy production and heat
transfers. In particular, the lower bound is expressed as
η≥ηC
1+kBTLVar[Σ]/(2/angbracketleftW/angbracketright).
(1)
The necessary and suﬃcient conditions of lower and up-
per bounds will be made explicit in terms of exchangeﬂuctuation theorem (EFT)[11–13]. Here, kBdenotes
Boltzmann constant, TLdenotes the temperature of the
cold reservoir, kBΣ is the entropy production, Wdenotes
the output work during a suﬃciently long period τ,/angbracketleft·/angbracketright
and Var[·] are the mean and variance. The dimensionless
entropyproduction is equal to Σ = −β1Q1+β2Q2, where
β1(β2) denotes the inverse temperature of the hot(cold)
reservoir, Q1andQ2stand for the net heat transfer from
the hot reservoir R1to the working substance Sand that
fromSto the cold reservoir R2. Remarkably, the lower
bound has a universal form fully characterized by the
ratio between the ﬂuctuation of the irreversible entropy
production and the mean output work divided by kBTL.
This lower bound also shows that the eﬃciency ηcan be
close to Carnot eﬃciency ηCif the ﬂuctuation of the en-
tropy production is relatively small compared with the
averaged work divided by kBTL.
Notethattheaverageofthework /angbracketleftW/angbracketrightandthevariance
of the entropy production Var[ kBΣ] are typically propor-
tional to the time duration τin the stationary regime,
and we can rewrite the lower bound as
ηC
1+kBTLVar[Σ/τ]τ/(2/angbracketleftP/angbracketright)(2)
in terms of the entropy production per unit time and the
powerP=W/τ.
Let us express the variance of the entropy production
in terms of the heat transfer Qj(j= 1,2), from which
Var[Σ] can be experimentally accessible. For simplicity
of notation, we consider the quantities during τinstead
of those per unit time. The ﬂuctuation of the entropy
production in the denominator of (1) can be expressed
by the variance and covariance of the heat transfers of
the heat engine
Var[Σ] = /angbracketleft(−β1Q1+β2Q2)2/angbracketright−/angbracketleft(−β1Q1+β2Q2)/angbracketright2
= (−β1,β2)Cov[Q1,Q2](−β1,β2)T
(3)2
and is usually considered to be the same order as the
output work divided by kBTL,/angbracketleftW/angbracketright/kBTL. Eq. (3) plays
an important role in deriving (19). Here, Cov[ ·,·] and
(−β1,β2)Tdenote the variance-covariance matrix and
a vector composed of the inverse temperatures of the
reservoirs. Hence, our result (1) provides a nontrivial
practical lower bound. Actually, the lower bound (1) as
well as an upper bound are numerically conﬁrmed for
a nanoscopic thermoelectric heat engine introduced in
Ref. [14] in the context of the eﬃciency at maximum
power[15, 16].
Set up.— For simplicity, let us consider the stationary
set up, i.e., a working substance Sis simultaneously in
contact with hot and cold reservoirs R1andR2at tem-
peratures THandTL. The heat transfer Q1(>0) from
the hot reservoir R1to the working substance Sis par-
tially transformed into the work W(>0), and the heat
Q2=Q1−W(>0) is absorbed by the cold reservoir RC.
Before the initial time t≤0, the working substance S
is detached from the reservoirs. At the initial time t= 0,
the total system starts to interact, and after a suﬃciently
long period at t=τthe interactions to R1andR2are
disconnected again.
First, we derive the lower bound (1) from the follow-
ing thermodynamic uncertainty relation(TUR) for the
entropy production
/angbracketleftΣ/angbracketright2
Var[Σ]≤/angbracketleftΣ/angbracketright
2. (4)
Here,thestandardTURclaimsthattheprecisionofsome
current-like quantities measured by the square mean to
variance ratio (signal to noise ratio) is upper bounded by
the half of the mean entropy production[6, 9].
The mean entropy production is expressed in terms of
ηas
/angbracketleftΣ/angbracketright=β2/angbracketleftW/angbracketright(ηC
η−1). (5)
Eq. (4) and (5) providesthe lowerbound ofthe eﬃciency
in (1). And, the equality holds in (1) if and only if TUR
is saturated.
Interestingly, a necessary condition, i.e, the lower
bound (1) should be smaller than the upper bound of
the eﬃciency in terms of the ﬂuctuation of power in Ref.
[4] is equivalent to TUR for Wbeing valid/angbracketleftW/angbracketright2
Var[W]≤/angbracketleftΣ/angbracketright
2.
This observation suggests that the lower bound of the
eﬃciency (1) is actually reasonable.
We can also derive an upper bound of the eﬃciency in
terms of a multivariate precision of heat transfers
η≤ηC
1+2kBTL/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright2+/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright2
(Var[Q1]+Var[Q2])/angbracketleftW/angbracketright(6)from the following TUR for multiple variables
(/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright,/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright)Ξ−1(/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright,/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright)T≤1
2/angbracketleftΣ/angbracketright.(7)
To complete the derivation of the upper bound under
the necessary and suﬃcient condition of TUR for heat
transfers (20), we show the following lemma.
Lemma 1
For an arbitrary invertible positive M×Msymmetric
matrixVwithM∈N, thefollowinginequalityholds. For
notational convenience, we use the bra-ket notation for
convenience.∀|a/angbracketright= (a1,a2,...,aM)T∈RM, theM×M
matrix|a/angbracketright/angbracketlefta|satisﬁes
|a/angbracketright/angbracketlefta| ≤ /angbracketlefta|V−1|a)/angbracketrightV. (8)
The inequality for nonnegative matrices (8) is derived
by noting that∀λ∈R,∀|c/angbracketright ∈RM, the following inequal-
ity holds
(λ/angbracketlefta|V−1+/angbracketleftc|)V(λV−1|a/angbracketright+|c/angbracketright)≥0.(9)
The lemma 1 is immediately shown from the non-
positivity of the discriminant of the function of λgiven
by the left hand side of (9) for all |c/angbracketright.
Applying the lemma 1 to the vector |a/angbracketright=
(/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright,/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright)Tand the covariance matrix V= Ξ, it
is straightforward to show the following lemma 2.
Lemma 2
The multivariate precision of the heat transfers and the
covariance matrix Ξ satisfy the following relation
/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright2+/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright2
Var[Q1]+Var[Q2]≤(/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright,/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright)Ξ−1(/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright,/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright)T.
(10)
One can verify (10) by comparing the largest eigenvalues
of both hand sides of (8).
Combining (5), (7) and Lemma 2, we obtain the upper
bound (6).
Microscopic foundation of the bounds.— The lower
and upper bounds (1) and (6) are considered as univer-
sal from the generality of TUR. Actually, TUR holds
for example for continuous time stochastic processes[6–
8, 17], which are applied to the analysis of the eﬃ-
ciency of the molecular motors[18] and of the micro-
scopic heat engines[4, 5], and veriﬁed also for the over-
damped Langevin dynamics[19, 20]. On the other hand,
violations of TUR were reported for example for under-
damped Langevin dynamics[21] and general Hamiltonian
dynamics[12].
Under this circumstance, to explore the range of ap-
plicability of TURs and consequently of the lower and
upper bounds (1) and (6), we show necessary and suf-
ﬁcient conditions of TURs for the entropy production3
and for the heat transfers in a uniﬁed manner in terms
of the exchange ﬂuctuation theorem(EFT)[11, 12] from
a microscopic point of view. Such an analysis is use-
ful. Actually, we show that the necessary and suﬃ-
cient conditions of TURs for the entropy production
(4) and for the heat transfers (7) are related but dif-
ferent. Here, the ﬂuctuation theorem(FT) is a univer-
sal symmetry for the ﬂuctuation of the entropy produc-
tion, which relates the probabilities of the positive and
negative entropy production[22–29] as reviewed in Ref.
[16, 30]. FT was conﬁrmed in various small systems
such as a draggedcolloidal particle in water[31], nonequi-
librium chemical reactions[32, 33], electron transport in
nanojunctions[34, 35] to name only a few. And, the mu-
tual relation between FT and TUR has been intensively
studied[12, 13, 36–38].
First, we derive EFT for the heat transfer among the
working substance and hot and cold reservoirs. Subse-
quently, we consider Nidentical copies of this system,
and deﬁne the rate function of the heat transfer of whole
the systemforﬁnite τowingtothe largedeviationprinci-
ple. Then, we show necessary and suﬃcient conditions of
the lower bound (1) and the upper bound (6) in a uniﬁed
manner in terms of EFT.
Without loss of generality, suppose the total sys-
tem including the reservoirs obeys the Hamiltonian
dynamics[11]. The hot and cold reservoirs are ini-
tially prepared in local equilibrium states, which is
described by the probability distribution ρ(Γ) =/producttext
j=1,21
Zje−βjHj(Γj). Here, Γ and Γ jdenote the state
in the phase space of the total system and that of the
j-th reservoir Rj. Also,βj,Hj(Γj), andZjdenote the
inverse temperature, the Hamiltonian, and the partition
function of the j-th reservoir, respectively.
Recall that the probability distribution of the heat
transferP(Q1,Q2,τ) satisﬁes EFT[11] as
P(Q1,Q2,τ) =/integraldisplay
dΓρ(Γ)δ(H1(Γ1)−H1(Γ1(τ))−Q1)
×δ(H2(Γ2(τ))−H2(Γ2)−Q2)
=/integraldisplay
dΓρ(Γ(τ))e−β1Q1+β2Q2δ(H1(Γ1(τ))−H1(Γ1)+Q1)
×δ(H2(Γ2)−H2(Γ2(τ))+Q2)
=e−β1Q1+β2Q2P(−Q1,−Q2,τ), (11)
where Γ( τ) and Γ j(τ) denote the states of the to-
tal system and of the j-th reservoir at t=τ, and
Hj(Γj(τ))−Hj(Γj) is the heat absorbed by the reservoir
jduringτ.
Exchange Fluctuation Theorem for Copies.— To dis-
cuss the large deviation principle for ﬁnite τ, let us con-
siderNidentical and mutually independent copies of
the system, i.e., the working substance Sand reservoirs
Rj(j= 1,2), and deﬁne the rate function in the limitN→ ∞as in Ref. [13]. We identify the ﬁrst copy
as the original system. Since the heat transfer is addi-
tive, we deﬁne the net heat transfer of the j-th reservoir
Qtot,j=/summationtextN
m=1Q(m)
j. Here,Q(m)
jdenotes the heat trans-
fer of the m-th copy, which obeys the same statistics as
Qjof the original system. The probability distribution
of the net heat transfer of the total system also satisﬁes
EFT
Ptot(Qtot,1=NQ1,Qtot,2=NQ2,τ)
=eN(−β1Q1+β2Q2)Ptot(Qtot,1=−NQ1,Qtot,2=−NQ2)
(12)
from the additivity of the heat transfers. Here,
Ptot(Qtot,1=NQ1,Qtot,2=NQ2,τ) stands for the prob-
abilitydistributionthatthe netheattransfer Qtot,jofthe
ensemble of the reservoir Rjequals to NQj(j= 1,2).
The corresponding rate function
I(Q1,Q2,τ)
=−lim
N→∞1
NlogPtot(Qtot,1=NQ1,Qtot,2=NQ2,τ)
(13)
is well-deﬁned from the large deviation principle[39],
sinceQtot,j(j= 1,2) is a sum of identical and inde-
pendent stochastic variables. The rate function satisﬁes
the following symmetry from EFT(12)
I(Q1,Q2,τ)−I(−Q1,−Q2,τ) =β1Q1−β2Q2.(14)
Let us evaluate the rate function from EFT (14) to
provide a relation among the cummulants of the heat
transfer such as the mean, the variance, and the covari-
ance. In the vicinity of the point corresponding to the
mean value of the heat transfer P 1= (/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright,/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright), the
rate function is well-approximated by the quadratic form
I+(Q1,Q2,τ)
=1
2(Q1−/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright,Q2−/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright)Ξ−1(Q1−/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright,Q2−/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright)T
(15)
from the centrallimit theorem[40, 41]. Here, Ξ is a short-
hand notation of the 2 ×2 variance-covariance matrix
Ξ = Cov( Q1,Q2) of the heat transfer. The subscript +
inI+emphasizesthat (15)is alocalapproximationofthe
actual rate function. On the other hand, EFT (14) and
(15) imply that the rate function behaves quadratically
near another point P 2= (−/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright,−/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright) as
I−(Q1,Q2,τ)

and P 2are large so that the I−(Q1,Q2,τ) does not cross the
Q1−Q2plane.
Lower bound of the Eﬃciency.— First, we show
a necessary and suﬃcient condition of TUR for the
entropy production (4) in terms of EFT.
Necessary and Suﬃcient Condition of TUR
TUR (4) holds if and only if the minimum of the local
approximation I−(Q1,Q2,τ) is non-positive.
To derive this necessary and suﬃcient condition of
TUR, let us investigate the condition for the minimum
ofI−(Q1,Q2) being non-negative
minQ1,Q2I−(Q1,Q2)≤0. (17)
By taking the partial derivatives of I−(Q1,Q2) with re-
spect to Q1andQ2, and equating zero, one can easily
verify that the minimum is achieved for
(Q1+/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright,Q2+/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright)T= Ξ(−β1,β2)T.(18)2468μ20.20.40.60.81.0η

FIG. 2. The lower- and the upper-bound of the eﬃciency (1)
and (6) for a quantum thermoelectric heat engine. (a)The
eﬃciency η(black curve) and its lower and upper bounds (red
and blue curves) as a function of µ1for Γ1= Γ2= 1,ǫ= 10,
µ2= 1,T1= 10, and T2= 1. (b)The eﬃciency η(orange)
and its lower and upper bounds (red and blue surfaces) as a
function of µ1andǫ. The parameters except for ǫis the same
as in (a).
Substituting (18) into (16) and applying (3), the mini-
mum of the local approximation I−(Q1,Q2) is rewritten
as
minQ1,Q2I−(Q1,Q2) =−1
2Var[Σ]+ /angbracketleftΣ/angbracketright.(19)
Hence, (17) is equivalent to TUR (4). This completes
the proof.
Upper bound of the Eﬃciency.— Remarkably, the nec-
essaryandsuﬃcient conditionof(7) is diﬀerentfrom (17)
I−(/angbracketleftQ1/angbracketright,/angbracketleftQ2/angbracketright)≤0. (20)
Note that (20) is a suﬃcient condition of TUR for
the entropy production (4) , since if (20) holds then
minQ1,Q2I−(Q1,Q2)≤0 is valid. We also remark that
(20) is reasonable, since the non-positivity of the local
approximation at the mean value is actually equivalent
to TUR for single variable case[13].
Example.— Let us conﬁrm the validity of (1) for the
nanothermoelectric heat engine introduced in Ref. [14].
The electron ﬂows among two reservoirs through a quan-
tum dot with a sharply deﬁned resonant energy ǫ. The5
temperature Tiand the chemical potential µi(i= 1,2)
satisfyT1> T2andµ1< µ2, and the system operate as a
heat engine with the input heat ǫ−µ1and output work
µ2−µ1per an electron transfer by choosing the ther-
modynamic aﬃnity −ǫ−µ1
T1+ǫ−µ2
T2positive. The time
evolution of this heat engine is described by a stochastic
master equation for the occupation number of the dot.
The transition of the electron in the dot to the reservoir
Rjoccurs at the rate k(j)
01= Γjf(xj) and the correspond-
ing reversed transition from the reservoir to the empty
dot occurs with the rate k(j)
10= Γj(1−f(xj)) by using
the wideband approximation. Here, we used abbreviated
notation xj=ǫ−µj
Tjandf(x) =1
ex+1denotes the Fermi-
Dirac distribution. Γ jstands for the frequency. And, the
cumulants of the number of transfered particles can be
calculated in the general method in terms of the transi-
tion rates[42]. The number of transfered particles from
the reservoir R1to the dot J1and that from the dot to
the clod reservoir J2are related to the heat transfers as
Q1= (ǫ−µ1)J1andQ2= (ǫ−µ2)J2, and the means and
the variances of the accumulated number of transfered
particles are given as
/angbracketleftJ1/angbracketright=/angbracketleftJ2/angbracketright=Γ1Γ2
Γ1+Γ2(f(x1)−f(x2))τ(21)
and
Var[J1] = Var[J2] = Cov[J1,J2]
= (Γ1Γ2
Γ1+Γ2(f(x1)(1−f(x2))
+f(x2)(1−f(x1)))−1
Γ1+Γ2/angbracketleftJ1/angbracketright2)τ.(22)
The eﬃciency is calculated as
η=µ2−µ1
ǫ−µ1. (23)
In this manner, the applicability of lower and upper
bounds (1) and (6) are veriﬁed as illustrated in Fig. 2.
Conclusion.—
We have shown universal lower and upper bounds of
the eﬃciency of a class of mesoscopic heat engines from
TURs. As for the lower bound, the ratio between the
variance of the dimensionless entropy production due to
the heat transfer Σ and the mean of the power β2/angbracketleftP/angbracketright
plays a role. On the other hand, the upper bound holds
under a necessaryand suﬃcient condition of multivariate
TUR for heat transfers explicitly deﬁned in terms of the
ﬂuctuation of the heat transfer.
