1. Introduction  
The first quadrotors began to be produced in the 1920s. Produced from the 1920s to the 1970s, 
quadrotors were large -scale aircraft controlled by a pilot. With the development of technology, 
quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles have been produced since the late 1990s. While the first 
quadrotors used by the pilot were produced for the purpose of carrying people and cargo, quadrotor 
UAVs can be used for many dif ferent purposes  [1-3]. In the last few years, the importance of quadrotor 
UAVs has increased due to their extensive range of applications , such as monitoring, firefighting, crop 
spraying, mapping, transporting goods, aerial photogr aphy and military operations. In general, 
quadrotor UAVs can be used in various civil operations and defense industry applications [4-7]. The

Accepted  April  21, 2023  In this study, a fault -tolerant super -twisting sliding mode controller with 
a control allocation system for a quadrotor aircraft is proposed. Super 
twisting sliding mode control is a robust control technique that handles a 
system with a relative degree equal to one. A super-twisting sliding mode 
controller is proposed because of its  robustness to uncertainties and 
perturbations . It increases accuracy and reduces chattering. A control 
allocation algorithm is developed to cope with the actuator fault. Firstly, 
a nonlinear model of the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is 
presente d. Then, the controller design and type of the actuator fault are 
explained. The control allocation algorithm is used to optimize the 
trajectory tracking performance of the quadrotor in the presence of an 
actuator fault. A control allocation algorithm is an effective approach to 
implement ing fault-tolerant control. When actuator faults are identified, 
they can be modeled as changes in the B matrix of constraints. Various 
simulations have been made for situations with and without actuator 
failure. In normal  conditions, the quadrotor  can accurately track altitude, 
roll, pitch and yaw references. In faulty conditions, the quadrotor can 
follow the references with a small error. Simulations prove the 
effectiveness of the control allocation algorithm , which stabili zes the 
quadrotor in case of an actuator fault.  Overall, this paper presents a novel 
fault-tolerant controller design for quadrotor aircraft that effectively 
addresses actuator faults using a super -twisting sliding mode controller 
and control allocation al gorithm.

Mehmet Karahan (Fault Tolerant Super Twisting Sliding Mode Control of a Quadrotor UAV Using Control 
Allocation)  
 have led many researchers to be interested in this issue [8]. Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles' 
vertical take -off and landin g (VTOL) ability, hovering in the air, ability to rotate around their own 
axis, take -off and land ing on uneven ground s make them more advantageous than winged unmanned 
aerial vehicles  [9-12]. 
In practical applications, quadrotors are generally required to track a prescribed path accurately 
and rapidly. However, it is a challenging task because of parameter uncertainties, actuator faults and 
external disturbances [13]. Therefore, fault -tolerant controller d esign gains great importance for 
quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles.  
In the early studies, researchers mainly focused on PID controller design and linearized quadrotor 
dynamics, neglected some aerodynamic coefficients and ignored faults. Salih et al. desig ned a PID 
controller for a quadrotor UAV and neglected the inertia matrix of the aircraft and the gyroscopic 
effect caused by the propellers’ rotation [14]. Ma et al. proposed a fuzzy PID controller for a quadrotor 
UAV, linearized  the nonlinear system and neglected drag coefficients, aerodynamic, Coriolis and 
gyroscopic effects [15]. Shang et al. designed a fractional -order PID controller for a quadrotor UAV 
and ignored some small coefficients in the trans fer function of the system [16]. Khatoon et al. 
compared PID and LQR controllers for a quadrotor UAV and linearized system about a certain 
operating point for using an LQR controller. It is concluded that the LQR controller is more robust 
and generate s low steady -state error [17]. Huang et al. developed a backstepping controller, ignored 
some small coefficients related to inertia moments during the controller design process and compared 
results with a classical PID controller. It is observed that the backsteppin g controller has a lower 
settling time and faster time response than the PID controller [18]. Yu et al. developed an integral 
sliding mode controller for a quadrotor UAV and replaced the signum function with the saturation 
functio n to minimize the chattering effect in the controller’s equations. Yu et al. also compared 
simulation results with the traditional PID controller and observed that the sliding mode controller 
converged rapidly to the attitude reference and showed better pe rformance [19]. 
In the last few years, researchers have focused on fault -tolerant controller design for unmanned 
aerial vehicles. Fault -tolerant controllers maintain a stable performance regardless of disturbances 
[20], [21]. Ermeydan et al. designed a fault -tolerant PID controller for a quadrotor UAV. In the first 
and third rotors, a 20% loss of control effectiveness is simulated. It is observed that the PID controller 
can contro l the quadrotor stably up to 20% failure level in two rotors [22]. Sadeghzadeh et al. 
developed an active fault -tolerant PID controller for a quadrotor UAV, simulated a faulty scenario 
with up to 22% of power loss in power of all rotors and developed a gain scheduling strategy for faulty 
conditions [23]. Jun et al. proposed a fault -tolerant PID controller design for a quadrotor. It is observed 
that quadrotor flight is stable with a 2.2% height reduction when a 50% loss of effectiveness at one 
rotor [24]. Zhang et al. proposed linear quadratic  regulator (LQR) and model predictive  controllers  
(MPC)  for a quadrotor UAV against rotor failures, considered 30% and 50% of loss effectiveness in 
one rotor , respectively and compared the results [25]. Nguyen et al. designed a fault -tolerant 
backstepping controller and performed simulations at 40% loss of control effectiveness at one rotor 
[26]. Some researchers have focused on developing a fault -tolerant sliding mode controller for the 
quadrotor UAV. Wang et al. develop ed an incremental sliding mode controller for a quadrotor UAV 
and simulated a 25% fault case for one rotor  [27]. Yang et al. designed a sliding mode fault -tolerant 
controller for a quadrotor UAV with varying load and actuator faul ts. They proposed a method , a 40% 
power loss in one rotor at the 12th second  [28]. Nguyen et al. developed a fault -tolerant sliding mode 
controller for a quadrotor UAV. They implemented a 40% loss of control effectiveness into the 
actuator  [29]. In practical applications of sliding mode controller s, researchers may face the 
undesirable phenome non of oscillations having finite frequency and amplitude, which is called 
chattering.  Chattering leads to low control accuracy, high heat losses in power circuits and high wear 
of moving mechanical parts.  It can arise from the fast dynamics which were neg lected in the ideal 
model  [30]. When a fault occurs in the system, the control allocation mechanism redistributes (re -
allocates) the control signals produced by the controller among available actuators so that the 272 International Journal of Robotics and Control Systems  ISSN 2775 -2658  Vol. 3, No.  2, 2023, pp. 270-285

 controller has t he same effects on the system output or at least produce s the same steady -state 
responses  [31]. 
In this research, a fault-tolerant super -twisting sliding mode controller with control allocation is 
proposed for a quadrotor UAV. 60% loss of control effectiveness at one rotor is simulated. The control 
allocation algorithm is used to stabilize the controller in case of an actuato r fault. MATLAB 
simulations are performed for the cases with and without rotor failure , and the difference is observed. 
The major contributions of this research are outlined as follows:  
1) Fault -tolerant super -twisting sliding mode controller with a control a llocation algorithm is 
developed to control the quadrotor in case of actuator fault. The sliding -mode controllers are 
more robust than the other controller methods described above, but they suffer from a 
chattering problem. Unlike classical sliding mode co ntrollers, our proposed controller does 
not have a chattering problem.  
2) Many researchers have studied actuator failure at rates ranging from 20% to 50%. Our study 
focused on an actuator failure rate of 60%, higher than many other studies. Thanks to the 
control allocation algorithm, the quadrotor is controlled in a stable manner despite the high 
rate of actuator failure.  
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section II , the dynamics of the quadrotor 
unma nned aerial vehicle are explained. In Section III , the fault-tolerant super -twisting sliding mode 
control structure is explained. The MATLAB simulations of the proposed fault -tolerant sliding mode 
controller with contr ol allocation are presented in Section IV . Lastly, the conclusions of this research 
are stressed in Section V . 
2. Quadrotor Model  
Quadrotor is a four -rotor unmanned aerial vehicle with vertical landing and take -off feature s. The 
power unit of the quadrotor consists of two opposing rotor pairs. The (1,3) rotor pair and (2,4) rotor 
pair rotate in opposite directions to each other. There are four different movements in the quadrotor 
UAV. Si multaneously increasing or reducing the speed of all four rotors of the quadrotor leads to 
vertical movement [32]. Changing the speed of the (1,3) rotor pair of the quadrotor creates roll motion. 
Raising or reducing the speed of t he (2,4) rotor pair of the quadrotor creates the pitch motion. The 
difference in torque between the (1,3) and (2,4) rotor pairs produce  the yaw motion. A schematic 
representation of the four -rotor unmanned aerial vehicle with 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) is given 
in Fig. 1  [33]. The rotation direction of the rotors, the torques produced by the rotors, the Earth frame, 
the body frame, roll, pitch and yaw movements are represented in Fig. 1 .

3. Controller Design  
The fault -tolerant super twisting sliding mode control is proposed to track the given altitude and 
attitude references in case of 60% actuator failure at one rotor. The control allocation algorithm is 
activated when one of the four rotors fails and enables  the quadrotor to follow the references stably.  
3.1. Super Twisting Sliding Mode Controller  
The s liding mode controller design is more robust than other controller methods in the literature. 
Two stages are very important in the sliding mode controller approach.  
1) The selection of the sliding surface  
2) State variables must remain on the sliding surf ace 
The sliding phase and the reaching phase of the sliding mode controller are represented in Fig. 4 . 
and the sliding surface is defined in (13) [39]. 
 𝑠 = 𝑒̇ + 𝜆𝑒 (13) 
where 𝑒 is the error and 𝜆 represents the tuning parameter.  
The sliding variables used in the sliding mode controller are given in (14). 
 𝑠𝑇=[𝜑 𝜃 𝜓 𝑧] (14) 
The sliding variables must reach the sliding surface in finite time and slide on the surface to reach 
0 asymptotically with the aim of controlling the quadrotor to the reference trajectory [40].

 The equivalent control inputs for the sliding mode controller can be summarized as follows.  
 𝑈1𝑒𝑞=𝑚
cos𝜑cos𝜃(𝑔 +𝑧̈𝑑−λ(𝑧̇𝑑 – 𝑧̇)) (15) 
 𝑈2𝑒𝑞=𝐼𝑥
𝑙(−𝜃̇𝜓̇(𝐼𝑦−𝐼𝑧

 𝑈4𝑒𝑞=𝐼𝑧
𝑙(−𝜑̇𝜃̇(𝐼𝑥−𝐼𝑦
𝐼𝑧)+ 𝜓̈𝑑−λ(𝜓̇𝑑− 𝜓̇)) (18) 
A discontinuous term is added to the equivalent control for the purpose of satisfying the sliding 
reachability condition by substituting  
 𝑠̇=− 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑠) (19) 
The equivalent control equation can be written as follows.  
 𝑈1= 𝑈1𝑒𝑞+𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑠𝑧) (20) 
 𝑈2=𝑈2𝑒𝑞+𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑠𝜑) (21) 
 𝑈3=𝑈3𝑒𝑞+𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑠𝜃) (22) 
 𝑈4=𝑈4𝑒𝑞+𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑠𝜓) (23) 
The sign function being discontinuous will cause a high -frequency oscillation called the 
chattering effect [41]. In order to cope with the chattering effect sign function is replaced with an 
alternative continuous function (24). 
 𝑓𝑢𝑛(𝑠)=[(1+𝑠)𝑛−(1−𝑠)𝑛][(1+𝑠)𝑛+(1−𝑠)𝑛⁄ ] (24) 
where 𝑛 is an even integer greater than 0 , signum function and alternative continuous function graphs 
are shown  in Fig. 5  through Fig. 6 . Fig. 5  represents the alternative continuous function when 𝑛=2.

Fig. 6.  A continuous function with n = 2  
The use of the continuous function reduces chattering ; however , it can lead to decreasing the 
robustness of the controller. A higher -order linear switching function can be replaced instead of a 
nonlinear switching function with the purpose of reducing the chattering effect. Super -twisting sliding 
mode controller prese nts such a switching function that can balance with the robustness of the 
controller and high -frequency chattering.  
In order for the sliding variables to reach the sliding surface in a finite time and without 
chattering, the following higher -order switchin g function is used.

The control inputs for the super -twisting sliding mode controller are calculated in Equations  (26)-
(29) where  𝑘1,…,𝑘4 are positive constants.

 𝑈4 = 𝑈4𝑒𝑞 – 1.5𝑘41/2𝑠𝜓1/2𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑠𝜓) – ∫1.1𝑘4 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑠𝜓) (29) 
3.1. Control Allocation Algorithm  
When one of the rotors loses its effectiveness by 60%, the controller should counter the loss of 
effectiveness and continue the reference track safely. The loss of actuator effectiveness is calculated 
by comparing the desired angular velocity of the rotor ( 𝑤𝑑) with the actual angular velocity of the 
rotor (𝑤). The loss of effectiveness ( 𝐿𝐸) is calculated as in (30). 
 𝐿𝐸 = (𝑤𝑑 – 𝑤)/𝑤𝑑 (30) 
The LE value is always between 0 and 1. When the 𝐿𝐸 value is 0, there is no power loss in the 
rotor, and when it is 1, there is a 100% power loss in the rotor. When the 𝐿𝐸 value rises above 0, the 
control allocation algorithm is activated , and the power loss in the rotor is compensated. When one of 
the p ropellers of the quadrotor fails, the quadrotor loses its balance. When the faults are determined,

 the angular velocity of the rotor opposite to the faulty rotor is calculated such that the torque balance 
is maintained. The control effectiveness of the qua drotor UAV is defined in (31).

where 𝑘𝑖∈[0 1] and 𝑘𝑖=1 means that the actuator is completely functional and 𝑘𝑖=0 describes 
the case where the actuator does not work at all. After the fault is detected, the control output is

The fault -tolerant super twisting sliding mode controller diagram is represented in Fig. 7 .  Sliding 
mode control is a variable structure control method.  The state feedback control law is not a continuous 
function of time. It can switch from one continuous structure to another continuous structure based on 
the current position in the state space  [42], [43]. The sliding variable must be used to define the sliding 
surface.  The reference trajectory is the trajectory given for the quadrotor to follow.  The quadrotor tries 
to follow this trajectory using the sliding mode controller. When an actuator error occurs , and power 
loss occurs in one of the rotors, the control allocation mechanism is activated. It readjusts the power 
distribution between the roto rs and keeps the quadrotor flying stably.

4. Result and Discussions  
In this part, the efficiency of the proposed fault -tolerant super -twisting sliding mode controller is 
verified by MATLAB simulations. The physical pa rameters of the quadrotor defined in the second 
section are used in the MATLAB simulations. An actuator fault due to 60% power loss in the fourth 
rotor is introduced at the beginning of the simulation. Simulations were made separately for cases with 
and wi thout actuator failure. In this way, it has been observed more clearly how tolerant the proposed 
controller is against actuator errors. Fig. 8 -11 shows the roll, pitch, yaw and altitude tracking responses 
of the controller without actuator failure.

Fig. 11.  Altitude reference tracking simulation of the controller without rotor failure  
It is clear from the simulations in Fig. 8 -11 that the quadrotor can follow the given sinusoidal 
references with almost 0 error. The references for roll, pitch, and yaw angles are in radians, and the 
reference for altitude is in meters. The red line in the graphs represents the given sinusoidal refer ence, 
while the blue line shows the trajectory followed by the quadrotor. The part between 5 and 5.2 seconds 
in the graphs has been enlarged to provide a clearer observation of the reference (red line) and the 
trajectory followed by the quadrotor (blue lin e).  
Table 2  gives the time response ( rise time, overshoot and settling time ) values of the controller 
without rotor failure. Rise time is defined as the time required for a signal to change from 10% to 90% 
of a specified value.  Overshoot is the occurrence of a signal exceeding its target.  Settling time is the 
time required by the response to reach and steady within a specified range of 2 % of its final value.  
When the data in Table 2  is carefully examin ed, it is seen that the references of roll, pitch and yaw 
angles are followed with a slight overshoot of around 0.5%. The altitude reference is followed by an 
overshoot of 2.2%. The controller followed the roll, pitch and yaw references very closely from t he 
start of the simulation and never left the ± 2% range. Therefore, the settling time is 0 seconds for these 
references. The altitude reference shows a little more overshoot and settles in the ±2% range in 0.25 
seconds. In the absence of rotor error, the controller can follow the given references almost without 
error.

Fig. 12 -15 show simulations indicating the reference tracking results when the fourth rotor of the 
quadrotor experiences 60% power loss. In case of a rotor failure in the quadrotor, the control allocation 
algorithm activates, ensuring that the quadrotor stably follow s the given references. The control 
allocation algorithm can compensate for the failure of the fourth rotor with the help of the other 3 
rotors.  
In case of 60% rotor failure, the quadrotor can still follow the given references. However, a small 
overshoot i s observed at the peaks of the sinusoidal references. This is due to power loss in one rotor 
of the quadrotor. As explained in Section II , the torque difference between the rotor pairs (1,3) and 
(2,4) produces the yaw mo tion. Due to the power loss in the fourth rotor, the torque difference between 
the rotor pairs increases , and a higher overshoot occurs during the yaw angle reference tracking. When

stable reference tracking by compensating for rotor failure.

Table 3 gives the time response (rise time, overshoot and settling time) values of the controller 
with rotor failure. When the time response data in Table 3  is examined, it is seen that the rotor error 
increases the overshoot. However, it is not high enough to prevent the quadrotor from flying stably. 
The settling time is slightly longer than when there is no rotor error. However, the reference value is 
captured at around 0.6 seconds for roll, pitch and altitude references. The yaw refer ence can be 
captured in about 1 second. The system has a short settling time despite rotor failure.

5. Conclusion  
This research proposes a fault -tolerant super -twisting sliding mode controller for a quadrotor. 
Firstly, the development of the quadrotor’s dynamic model is explained. Then, the working principle 
of the proposed controller is explained. To eliminate the chattering effect in the sliding mode 
controller, the signum function has been replaced with a continuous function. Then, it is explained 
how the fault -tolerant controller is imple mented by using the control allocation algorithm. Thanks to 
the control allocation algorithm, 60% power loss in a single rotor can be tolerated. In this way, the 
quadrotor can follow the given references in a fault -tolerant manner. In the simulations secti on, 
different  simulations have been made for cases with and without rotor failure. In this way, the 
efficiency of the fault -tolerant sliding mode controller is better observed. Simulations were made for 
reference tracking , and the results were compared. It  has been observed that in the absence of rotor 
failure, the quadrotor follows the sinusoidal references almost flawlessly.  In the case of 60% rotor 
failure in a single rotor, it has been observed that the quadrotor follows the references stably thanks to 
the control allocation algorithm. In addition, rise time, overshoot and settling time data were obtained 
for cases with or without rotor failure. When the data obtained are examined, it is seen that the 
quadrotor successfully follows all the references, al most without overshoot, in the absence of rotor 
failure. When power loss occurs due to rotor error, the quadrotor can follow the references by showing 
a small overshoot. As a result, it has been observed that the fault -tolerant super -twisting sliding mode 
controller with control allocation works successfully. In future studies, a control allocation algorithm 
will be developed that will enable the quadrotor aircraft to fly stably in case of a failure of the two 
rotors.
