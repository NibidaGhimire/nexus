Abstract  
Molecular chirality  plays fundamental roles in biology.  The chiral response of a molecule 
occurs at a specific spectral position, determined by its molecular structure. This fingerprint can 
be transferred to other spectral regions via the interaction with locali zed surface plasmon 
resonances of gold nanopartic les. Here, we demonstrate  that molecular chirality transfer occurs 
also for  plasmonic lattice modes , providing a very effective and tunable means to control 
chirality . We use colloidal self -assembly to fabricate non-close packed, periodic arrays of gold 
nanoparticles, which are embedded in a polymer film containing chiral molecules. In the 
presence of the chiral molecules, the SLRs become optically active , i.e. showing  handedness -
dependent excitation . Numerical simulations  with varying lattice parameters show circular 
dichroism peaks shifting along  with the spectral positions of the lattice modes,  corroborating 
the chirality transfer  to these collective modes . A semi -analytical model based on the coupling 
of molecular and plasmonic resonances rationalizes this chirality transfer.  
Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes  
Goerlitzer et al.  2 1 Introduction  
Chiral plasmonics is among nanophotonics’ most intriguing and interdisciplinary fields and is 
on the leap towards real -life app lication s.1–11 Chiral molecules are abundant  yet crucially 
important  in nature.12 The handedness of a molecule underpins its function in biological 
systems, d espite having an otherwise  identical  chemical nature as the enantiomeric counterpart . 
On a larger length scale, encoding chirality into plasmonic materials  has enabled the 
manipulat ion of electromagnetic fields  and thus tailor ing light-matter interactions,1–4,6,8 –11 and 
enhanc ing the sensitivi ty of chiral molecule detection,  2,5–7 with the potential to enable  early 
disease detection  in tissue s.13 The potential to use chiral nanophotonic sensors to enhance 
molecular signals is appealing . However,  the accurate measurement of molecular  circular 
dichroism ( CD) spectra in the ultraviolet region  require s sensitive  and expensive  
instrumentation .14 Furthermore , the fabrication of  suitable plasmonic  systems for such chiral 
detection is complex  and requires sophisticated infrastructure .15–18 
Chiral plasmonic metamaterials  exhibit much larger CD signals compared to chiral molecul es.14 
The dominant chiral signal of such metamaterials might screen the intrinsic chiral information 
from the molecule,  thus necessitating background subtraction  and alignment.19–23 These 
difficulties can be overcome by using  racemic  metamaterial  structures, which do not exhibit an 
overall intrinsic far-field CD signal  and thus do not shield the molecular signal .19,24 –28 
A conceptually much simpler  alternative  can take advantage of  plasmonic resonances in  
isotropically achiral  nano particles to detect the handedness of a molecular analyte. Such 
nanoparticles  can become  optical ly activ e by a chirality transfer from the molecules  in their 
vicinity  (see Figure 1a, green line and Supporting Figure 1).17,22,29 –32 A particular appealing 
aspect of this mechanism is that the  observation of chirality occurs at the plasmonic resonance 
in the visible range, while the initial molecular signal can be  located  at lower wavelengths , i.e., 
in the UV .33 However, this transfer may come  at the cost of losing some information of the 
molecular CD  spectrum  as, in general, helicity is not preserved by plasmonic nanoparticles . 
This m olecular chirality transfer  has so far solely been demonstrated for locali zed surface 
plasmon resonances (LSPRs) .34–42  
The chirality transfer between molecules and LSPRs of plasmonic structures17,22,23,29 –32 is 
complex  and remain s subject to current research.43–50 Using individual  nano particles  seems  
straightforward, but shows certain limitations . Single  nanoparticles show relatively weak near -
fields in their proximity  and broad resonance features . These near-fields can be enhanced in 
hotspots formed by dimers  or chains of nanoparticles  to improve the induced chirality . 
However,  their mode volume remains strongly confined to a small region .34–42 Surface lattice 
resonances (SLRs)  may provide solutions  to these drawbacks . SLRs occur in periodic 
plasmonic nanoparticle a rrays and result from electromagnetic  coupling of LSPRs and 
diffractive  modes . This coupli ng reduces losses, leading to sharp, spectrally tunable modes .51–
56 Characteristically, the enhanced near-fields in SLRs51–53,55 are much more delocalized 
throughout the volume between the particles as compared to  that in LSPRs.57,58  
Here, we demonstrate  the molecular chirality transfer to lattice resonances, using arrays of 
spherical gold nanoparticles, as the simplest possible realiz ation of such systems.  We 
hypothesize th at randomly arranged molecules  covering these  substrates (Figure 1a) can 
successfully couple with the achiral plasmonic particles in the array . Thus , both LSPRs and 
SLRs in such a ‘hybrid’  system will show  an ind uced chirality (Figure 1b, blue line ) if the 
chiral molecules surround them . This demonstration of chirality transfer to collective plasmonic Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes  
Goerlitzer et al.  3 modes opens  possibilities to harvest the attractive properties of lattice resonances, like spectral 
tunability and narrow features, towards molecular chirality  detection.

layer of polymer (PMMA). This chiral film is sandwiched between a glass substrate  and immersion oil of

molecular resonance  as shown in the schematic spectra  (red). This means the absorption is different 
for the left and right -handed  circularly polarized light . Randomly arranged achiral gold nanoparticles  
added to a chiral film can show  induced chirality at the LSPR  (green ). An assumed array of spherical 
gold nanoparticles will excite , in addition to a broad LSPR , also sharp surface lattice resonances (SLRs) 
and R ayleigh anomal ies (RA). In this work , we extend the effect of induced chirality to lattice modes . 
We assume these  coherent resonances can also show optical activity when chiral  molecules are present 
in the nanoparticle arrays. Besides the LSPR, we could see  that the RA s and SLRs show  non-zero CD 
signals  (blue) . No actual data, s chematic representation  for illustrative visualization . 
2 Results  
2.1 Design of experimental system  
We experimentally realise  the proposed systems  (Figure 1a) to examine our hypothesis ( Figure 
1b). We fabricate large -area nanoparticle arrays on a substrate via colloidal self -assembly58,59 
(Figure 2a). We use core -shell (CS) microgels  with plasmonic  NP cores  (AuNP s; DTEM = 99 
nm) surrounded by soft poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) ( PNiPAm ) shells (bulk diameter Dh, core-
shell = 367 nm). These  CS microgels  are spread at  the air -water interface until  the interface is  
fully cover ed and a homogeneous monolayer of CS microgels in hexagonal arrangement is 
formed . The  monolayer is then transferred to a glass slide (Supporting Figure 2). After the 
first deposition, the  remaining  interfacial  CS mono layer re laxes into  a hexagonal a rray with 
increased l attice constant  Dhex, which again can be transferred to a solid substrate.  58,59 After 
transfer, the organic PNiPAm shell is removed by oxygen plasma, revealing the hexagonal array 
of AuNPs on the glass substrate ( Figure 2b). Using this method, we prepare samples with two 
different lattice constants , where the cores are separated by  Dhex ~ 450 nm and D hex ~ 550 nm  
(Exemplarily shown for Dhex ~ 450 nm in Figure 2b). Due to fabrication imperfections and a 
reduced coupling strength between the plasmonic resonance and the Rayleigh anomaly (RA), 
the latter results in broader SLRs.58  
Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes  
Goerlitzer et al.  4 As the chiral molecule, w e use Riboflavin  embedded in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) 
film to allow comparison with previous  experiment s.35 We modify the  established  protocol 
(details in the  experimental section ) to create a chiral polymer film  of ~ 200 nm thickness. The 
side view images ( Figure 2d) reveal that the AuNP s remain assembled  on the substrate. We 
produce a set of two r eference samples , one  with arrays of AuNPs in plain PMMA film s without 
Riboflavin, and a second one having a Riboflavin -containing  PMMA film without the AuNPs. 
All substrate films were  covered with immersion oil and a cover slide (Supporting Figure 2 
and Supporting Figure 3) to match the refractive index (RI)  and thus effectively excite 
SLRs .51–55. The homogeneous refractive index environment  also prevents sc attering, so the 
surface roughness of the PMMA film can be ignored . The large area covered by the AuNP array 
allows us to measure the samples in a commercial CD  spectrometer (Jasco J815a)  under normal 
illumination with a  custom build sampl e holder ( Supporting Figure 3).

removed, revealing the hexagonal arrays of AuNPs. A ~200 nm PMMA film with 40 mM Riboflavin was 
spin-coated on top. The RI environment was matched with immersion oil and a glass cover.  b) Top:

2.2 Experimental d emonstration of  molecular chirality transfer to lattice modes  
We optically characterise the prepared samples  by illumination with circularly polarized light 
at normal incidence. We measure absorption under  left and right circularly polarized ( LCP, 
RCP) illumination in transmission mode to obtain the CD spectra. First, in  Figure 3a and b  we 
show the absorption and CD spectra for all references, the pure chiral Riboflavin molecules  
embedded in PMMA  (red line),  and two AuNP array samples without any chiral molecules 
(black and grey  lines) . The bare molecular film shows spectral features  between 350 and 
500 nm, both in absorption and in CD. Note that the used glass substrate is not transmissive 
below 350  nm. Our measured molecular signals are comparable  in spectral position and 
intensity  with the previous study  of induced chirality  using th e same  molecule .35 The bare 
AuNP s arrays ( without molecules ) show two resonances  each, a LS PR located at around 575 
nm and SLRs with resonances at ~630  nm and ~720  nm for the samples with D hex ~ 450 nm 
Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes  
Goerlitzer et al.  5 (SLR1)  and D hex ~ 550 nm (SLR2) , respectively   (see also Supporting Figure 4). Assuming 
that the SLRs  result from coupling to the <1,0> diffra ction mode, we expect  Rayleigh  
anomalies at 592 nm and 724 nm, respectively, for the two interparticle spacings 
(𝑅𝐴<1,0> = √3/4  ∙ 𝐷ℎ𝑒𝑥, Supporting Figure 5).51–56 The spectra agree with previous results
obtained from  periodic arrays of  similar si zed, spherical  AuNPs .58,59 Note that the broadening 
of the SLRs arise s from  fabrication imperfections  typical of  self-assembled structures57,60 –62 
and limitations i n coherency and collimation  of the  commercial CD spectrometer .56 As 
anticipated , for achiral, plain arra ys of AuNPs , there are no signature s of chirality present in the 
CD spectra ( black and grey  lines in Figure 3b, see also  Supporting Figure 4). 
The combination of chiral molecules and achiral AuNP arrays  (‘hybrid’ system) changes the 
chiroptical response . Figure 3c and d  show  the spectra for these hybrid systems  (blue and 
yellow  lines) . The absorption spectra  of the hybrid systems  show the spectral features of the 
individual constituents (Figure 3c). In particular, both samples show a common molecular 
feature at 350 -500 nm and SLRs at ~645 nm (SLR1)  and ~693 nm (SLR2) , for the lattice 
parameters Dhex ~ 450 nm and  Dhex ~ 550 nm , respectively . In contrast, the CD spectra are 
seemingly not a mere addition of the two  component  signals  (Figure 3d). The CD signals in 
the molecular region change sign and shape , presumably because interactions with the AuNPs 
prevent the preservation of  the hel icity.48 Importantly, the CD spectra show several additional 
features not observed in the reference systems. Positive CD signals at ~575 nm, corresponding 
to the position of the LSPR s (grey arrow) , are found in both samples and result from  molecular  
chirality transfer to the LSPR s, corroborating results f rom literature.35  
The sample with D hex ~ 450 nm additionally shows a CD peak at ~650 nm . This positive CD 
peak nearly coincides with the  spectral position of the SLR1  peak ( Figure 3d, blue arrow ), 
indicating that the molecular chirality signal is transferred to the SLR of the array . 
Corroborating this  interpretation, the CD peak shift s along with the SLR for the sample with a 
larger lattice spacing  (Dhex ~ 550 nm) to ~ 700 nm, which spectrally coincides with the SLR2 
(Figure 3d, yellow  arrow) . Together, these observations provide experimental demonstration 
of plasmon -induced chirality transfer to  SLRs .

2.3 Theoretical description of the plasmon induced chirality transfer to surface lattice 
modes  
We systematically investigate the chirality transfer to SLRs via  full-wave  electromagnetic 
simulation s (COMSOL Multiphysics ®).63 We set up an array of gold nanospheres (D = 90 nm) 
positioned  at the bottom of a 200 nm thick chiral film, where the chiral response is introduced 
as specified below.  We consider a square array of spherical gold  nanoparticles  with a  variable  
lattice spacing  DLatt. The surrounding environment is assumed to be  a homogenous medium 
with refractive index neff = 1.518 matching the experiment . We include  the isotropic, 
homogenous chirality  by modify ing the constitu tive relations for the electric displacement field 
𝑫⃑⃑  and the magnetic  induction  𝑩⃑⃑  in the response of th e chiral film and incorporate it into the
COMSOL solver through the  Pasteur parameter  κ, as33,50: 
𝑫⃑⃑ =𝜀𝑬⃑⃑ −𝑖𝜅
𝑐 𝑯⃑⃑⃑ Eq 2-1
𝑩⃑⃑ =𝜇𝑯⃑⃑⃑ +𝑖𝜅
𝑐 𝑬⃑⃑ Eq 2-2
with 𝜀 being the permittivity, 𝜇 the permeability , 𝑯⃑⃑⃑  the magnetic field, and 𝑬⃑⃑  the electric field .33
The complex chirality parameter 𝜅 describes  the molecular chir optical response , modeled  by a 
frequency -dependent Lorentzian function , associated with a molecular elect ronic transition  
(See Methods for details)33. 
Figure  4a shows the average absorption of LCP and RCP light  for a bare  chiral film (red line ) 
and that of  a bare array of AuNPs  for a selected lattice spacing of Dsqu = 425 nm (black line ). 
We assume  a single molecular resonance at 𝜆0=400 nm. The absorption spectra of the bare
AuNP array show s a LSPR peak around 5 70 nm, as well as Rayleigh Anomalies ( RAs) and 
SLRs, marked with arrows.  For this lattice parameter , we obtain  the <1,0> RA to be at 
RA = neff ∙ Dsqu = 646 nm, and the <1,1> RA at 45 7 nm. The <1,0> RA couples  with the LSPR , 
resulting in a pronounced SLR at around 660 nm. The chiroptical response of both reference 
systems is shown in  Figure 4 b. As expected, no chiral activity is obser ved for the bare particle 
array ( black  line), whereas the chiral film  (red line)  shows a  bisignated  (i.e. having  a negative 
and positive peak around the resonance  position64) Lorentzian -like peak centered at 400  nm. 
We analyze the absorbance and chirality  of the hybrid system  in Figure 4c and d, respectively. 
Similar to the experimental case, t heir average  absorption  spectra  (blue and yellow lines ) appear 
as addition s of the spectral features of the chiral film and the  AuNP array . All resonances can 
be clearly identified , and their near -fields show the expected localized (LSPR) and delocalized 
nature (SLR) (Figure 4e) . In contrast, the differential absorbance , CD, of the hybrid system in 
Figure 4d shows clear features associated with the all plasmonic resonances  of the achiral 
AuNPs (Figure 4c), not found in the spectra of the individual components (Figure 4b).  In 
particular, beside a Lorentzian -like feature at the spec tral position of the LSPR  centered  around 
570 nm , distinctive and pronounced resonances around the spectral positions of the RA and 
SLR are observed.  Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes  
Goerlitzer et al.  7 Moreover, the chiral fingerprint of the molecular film seems to be modified by the influence of 
the plasm onic modes of the AuNP array.  As in the experimental case, w e hypothesize that the 
original shape of the molecular signal is not preserved because plasmonic AuNPs are not 
helicity preserving.48 
All spectral featu res of the experimental hybrid system  (Figure 3 ) are thus reproduced by the 
simulation s (Figure 4). Our simulations are also consistent with recent theoretical work50,65 –67 
and delocalised chiral fields of intrinsic  chiral latti ce modes62 recently used for chiral sensing.68

chiral film for right and left circularly polarized  (red line) , and for the achiral square array of AuNP sphere s 
(D = 90 nm) embedded in a homogeneous  achiral  medi um with neff = 1.518  (black line ). The molecular 
response  shows a pronounced resonan ce peak at 400  nm, and the particles array  exhibits a surface 
lattice resonance (SLR) at 660  nm, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at 570  nm and 
Rayleigh anomalies (RA)  at 426  nm and 645  nm. b) The differential absor ption (CD) shows a chiral 
signature for the molecular resonance, while the plain plasmonic arrays remains achiral (flat line at CD 
= 0). c) The mean absorption for the hybrid system  combining c hiral film (blue line) exhibits all spectra l 
features of the individual components. d) The c ircular dichroism (CD) shows strong absorption

side (iv -vi) view. Cuts  are through the center of the sphere, dashed lines indicat e the position of the  
AuNP and  the substrate/chiral film . 
We now systematically vary the lattic e parameters and investigate the occurrence and efficiency 
of the chirality transfer to the SLR modes.  In Figure 5a, we show the simulated absorbance for 
the different lattices in the presence of the molecular chiral film (hybrid system) . As expect ed, 
the system shows multiple higher -order RAs for large enough lattice parameters (D squ) 
appearing as dips in the absorption spectra.  To quantify the chiroptical effect on  these 
resonances , we show the differential absorbance  (CD)  for selected values of D squ in Figure 5b 
(full set  in Supporting Figure 6). Similar to the case of D squ = 425  nm (Figure 4c,d) we observe 
strong induced CD signatures around th e <1,0> RA . This spectral shift  demonstrates that the 
induced chirality mechanism results from the lattice modes  interacting with the molecules . This 
Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes  
Goerlitzer et al.  8 chirality transfer  can even be extended to higher order modes ( <1,1>, <0,2>, <2,1>, <2,2>) for 
very large spacing D squ. In Figure 5c, we plot the expected positions of the RAs (solid lines) 
together with the points of maximum  chiral  signal (CD min/max ). A closer look reve als the induced 
CD appears  with a  typical bisignate d shape  around the RA , i.e. resulting in a minima and 
maxima  around the resonance position . To extract the maximum , we used the stronge st of both 
peaks.  As a result, we see that the optical activity coincides with the RAs  for all lattice 
parameters.  As expe cted for such large particle -separation, the chiral signal at the position of 
the LSPRs is fairly  weak compared to the values around the  RAs (Figure 5b). To emphasize 
this effect more clearly, in Figure 5d we show the  CD contrast, defined as the difference 
between the CD maxima and minima at the  position of a RA (|𝐶𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝐶𝐷𝑚𝑖𝑛|). This contrast
exposes an effective and relatively large chirality transfer to the RAs through their coupling 
with the molecular CD. In spite of a smaller detuning to the molecular response, the LSPR s do 
not show such an effective chirality transfer for large AuNP  separations (green squares in 
Figure 5,d), therefore, one can conclude that RAs are more effective in the process of induced 
chirality transfer  compared to the LSPRs  appearing .

2.4 Insights into the mechanism of chirality transfer 
Electromagnetic interactions are known to be relevant in chirality transfer in hybrid systems 
composed of chiral molecules  and plasmonic nanoparticles.66,69,70 In particula r, th e 
electromagnetic coupling between the nanoparticles and the chiral molecules can induce 
differential dissipative currents in the plasmonic particles.71 These currents can induce a 
prominent CD response at the plasmonic resonan ce frequencies even  if the plasmonic system 
is achiral, a phenomenon known as the plasmon -induced CD effect. The full wave simulations 
of the array of gold n anospheres surrounded by a chiral film shown in Figure 4 naturally capture 
this effect. With the aim of qualitatively understanding th e phenomenon of chirality transfer to 
Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes  
Goerlitzer et al.  9 the lattice modes , we developed a semi -analytical model based on the couplin g of a dipolar 
chiral molecule to a  generic  optical resonator  described through a dipolar polarizability  which 
mimics  the spectral properties of the plasmonic array under study (see Supporting Information ). 
The interaction between the chiral molecule and t he plasmonic resonator is described within  
the Dyadic Green’s tensor formalism under the coupled dipole approximation .69 
Figure 6 summarizes the results of this phenomenological model. Figure 6a shows both the 
extinction cross section of a chiral molecule ( red line), and the polar izability mimicking the 
optical response of the nanoparticle array ( black line). The extinction  cross section of the 
molecule presents a Lorentzian line shape resonan ce at 𝜆= 400 nm similar to the  simulated  
molecular resonance in Figure 4a (red line) . The optical response of the plasmonic array is 
characterized by three Lorentzian resonances , one for each lattice resonance and another one 
for the LSPR . This reproduces the LSPR around 550  nm, the SLR at 650  nm and RAs at 460  nm 
and 645  nm. Figure 6c presents the extinction cross section of the hybrid system. Since we 
consider the resonator strength of a single molecule, the molecular polarizability is substantially 
weaker than the plasmonic resonances and is thus not resolved in the spectra.  Also note  that 
different positions and orientations of the molecular dipole were averaged to capture the effect 
of the random distribution of molecules in the experimental system.  The CD spectra for both  
the bare molecule and  the plasmonic array are shown in Figure 6b. As expected, only a feature 
corresponding to the chiral molecular resonance is observed.  The CD spectrum of the hybrid  
system  (Figure 6d) shows clear chiral signals at the spectral positions of all plasmonic modes, 
in agreement with experiment ( Figure 3) and  full numerical simulations ( Figure 4). It is 
remarkable that th e polar izability of a single molecule , hardly detectable in direct extinction 
spectra, is able to produce such a large chiral signature at other, tunable  spectral regions. The 
qualitative agreement provided by the coupled -dipole model points towards the basic 
mechanism of chirality transfer . A molecular chiral signal, even if largely detuned from the 
plasmonic resonance, is able to transfer its chirality via the  overlapping of  the spectral tail of 
the molecular signal  with the plasmonic resonance. This overlap, ev en if small, is actually the 
only form of coupling considered in our model . The coupling  is particularly pronounced if the 
plasmonic resonance exhibits spectrally narrow resonances, as it occurs in lattice modes . This 
is also the reason why the chirality t ransfer to the LSPR, even though spectrally less detuned, 
is less efficient. Note that considering the chiral molecule under the influence of the near -field 
created by the plasmonic array, without considering the coupling, does not reproduce the 
observed c hirality transfer (details in Supporting Information).  Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes

3 Conclusion  
In summary , we experimentally demonstrate a molecular chirality transfer to plasmonic lattice 
resonances . In the presence of a chiral molecular film, achiral AuNP arrays exhibit clear CD 
peaks at the position of their SLRs. Numerical simulations using AuNPs with syste matically 
varying lattice constants  embedded in a chiral film corroborate the experimental results and 
show chiral signals that spectrally coincide with the RAs and SLRs.  A phenomenological model 
based on coupled dipoles including full electromagnetic inte ractions identifies the 
electromagnetic coupling, through the spectral overlap , as responsible for the chirality transfer.  
Chirality transfer to SLRs offer s an exciting possibility to tailor the spectral position of a 
detected chiral signal simply by cha nging the interparticle distance.  Hence , such systems may 
be tuned to specific wavelengths to match desired light sources and detectors with optimised 
single -wavelength polarizing components. This makes such a platform suitable for in -line 
quality control measurements in (pharmaceutic) production si tes, chro matographic sensors, or 
in highly sensitive microfluidic devices. More sophisticated fabrication processes, providing 
SLRs with very high Q -factors56 may significantly enhance the induced CD signal. Local 
functionalization strategies72 or specifically targeted molecular motives73,74 may improve 
sensitivity and selectivity of the chiral response, and possibly provide  control of the orientation 
of the chiral molecules with respect to the p article array to further enhance the chirality transfer. 
Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes  
Goerlitzer et al.  11 4 Experimental  Methods  
4.1 Materials  
All chemicals were used as received without further purification unless specified otherwise. 
Chemicals for synthesis, assembly, and sensing were all purchased by Sigma -Aldrich or Carl 
Roth in synthesis or chromatography grade unless specified other. Ultrap ure water was from a 
Milli -Q system (18.2 M Ωcm, Elga PURELAB Flex). All substrates were glass substrates 
(microscopy slides, Objektträger) from Menzel/Carl Roth. Immersion Oil (n = 1.518) was 
purchased from Cargille (Type LDF, very low autofluorescence).  Plasmonic Au-PNIPAM 
core−shell microgel s were synthesised according to the protocol published elsewhere .58,59 
4.2 Induced Chirality Samples  
The assembly at the air -water interface and synthesis of the Au -PNIPAM core−shell microgel s 
(dCore ~ 99 nm) is based on established protocols from our groups and is described in more detail 
in Ref.58,59 The polymeric shells wer e removed by oxygen plasma treatment ( 4 sccm O2, 100 
W, 5 -10 min. ) without affecting the gold nanoparticle assembly. To ensure comparability with 
literature, the functionalization with a chiral test molecule and a homogenous refractive index 
environment, s amples were prepared following a modified literature protocol.35 Poly(methyl 
methacrylate) (PMMA, 5 wt.%) was dissolved in  dimethyl sulfoxide at 60° C under constant 
stirring  (350 rpm) overnight. No filt ering or purification was applied at any point. After cooling 
to ambient, riboflavin (40 mM) was added and stirred in a dark place for 4 hours. The slim 
substrates contain ing AuNP arrays were attached to a sacrificial cover slip (26x26 mm²) with 
double -sided carbon tape for spin -coating. The  polymeric solutions (400 µl) were spin -coated 
(30s, 3400 rpm, 400 µl) on the mounted samples within reduced ambient light (dark room). 
Samples were placed in a desiccator to remove the solvent by vacuum (~ 60 min). The backsides 
of the samples were cleaned with EtOH and Kimwipes prior to measuring CD spectra. A small 
drop of immersion oil was sandwiched between the substrate and a cover slip ( same as substrate 
here, see Supporting Figure 2 and Supporting Figure 3). 
4.3 Characteri sation 
4.3.1 Microscopy  
SEM imag es were taken using a GeminiSEM 500 (Zeiss, Germany) at 1 kV using the in -lens 
detector. AFM images ( original size 10x10 µm2) were measured with a Nanowizard  4 (JPK 
Instruments) in intermittent contact mode using OTESPA -R3 tips (Bruker) and analysed  with 
ImageJ software . 
4.3.2 Spectroscopy  
UV-Vis-NIR spectra  (only in SI) were measured using a conventional spectrometer (Lambda 
950, Perkin -Elmer) with a Glan Thompson  polarizer drive (Perkin -Elmer, B050 -5284), 
typically in the range between 400 and 2500 nm in 2 nm steps and 0.48  s integration time. 
Molecular CD  and absorption  spectra for circularly polarized light with high sensitiv ity were 
recorded using a commercial CD spectrometer (Jasco J815) with 1 s integration time at 50 
nm/min. The substrates were attached in a custom build substrate holder ( Supporting Figure 
3), allowing normal illumination and fitting into the temperature -controlled (N 2 flow, 21 °C) 
cuvette compartment.    Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes    
 
 
Goerlitzer et al.   12 4.4 Electrodynamic s imulations  
Differential absorb ance ∆A=A RCP-ALCP (RCP  and LCP referred to right - and l eft- circularly 
polarized light ) shown throughout the paper and representing  the optical response of the chiral 
slab/gold NP system upon interaction with circularly polarized light  at normal incidence  were 
obtained by numerically solving the full set of Maxwell’s equations for a bi-anisotropic media  
by  perform ing the Finite Element Method (FEM) implemented in the commercia l software 
COMSOL Multiphysics63 using the radio frequency module (RF) in the frequency domain.   
 
The complete system consisting of  an array of gold NPs and a  chiral film containing chiral 
molecules (riboflavin) was modelled using the lumped port formulation and imposing periodi c 
(Floquet) boundary conditions  at the in-plane  directions of a squared unit cell (x - and y -axis)  
and scattering boundary conditions in the out-of-plane direction (z -axis) . To represent the 
experimental conditions , a single gold spherical nanoparticle  (R = 45 nm) was assumed to be 
deposited at the bottom part of a 200  nm thickness slab representing th e chiral film . Both, gold 
NPs and the chiral slab were p laced in the middle of a sufficiently long ( ~1-2 µm) z -directed 
environment , representing the simulation unit cell. Accord ingly, the physical domains were 
placed in regular square array arrangements w ith corresponding  lattice parameters . Finally, 
perfectly matched layers (PML s) with a thicknesses T PML=500  nm w ere placed at the bottom 
and top parts of the simulation unit  in addition to the scattering boundary conditions  in the out -
of-plane axis  in order to avoid spurious reflections coming from the interfaces  along th is 
direction .  
 
All domains in the simulation box were meshed by using tetrahedral elements maintaining a 
maximum element  size mesh below λ/10 where λ is the wavelength of the incident light. For 
the elements corresponding to both the sphere and the slab domains, the size was ten times finer 
than the largest element size until convergence. A  homogeneous refractive index n eff = 1.518 
was used for all the simul ation box, except for the gold sphere and for the chiral film. For the 
former, the optical functions were taken from experimental data available in Ref. 75 and for the 
latter, we used the theoretical scheme followed, among others, in Refs. 33,40,50. The dispersive 
chirality parameter 𝜅(𝜔) of the chiral film used in the electromagnetic calculations  was 
modelled by a frequency -dependent Lorentzian function 𝜅(𝜔)=𝐴(𝑓(𝜔)+𝑖𝑔(𝜔)) associated 
with molecular electronic transitions with 𝑓(𝜔) and 𝑔(𝜔) given, respectively, by 𝑓(𝜔)=
𝜔𝑜2−𝜔2
(𝜔𝑜2−𝜔2)2+𝜔2Γ2  and  𝑔(𝜔)=𝜔Γ
(𝜔𝑜2−𝜔2)2+𝜔2Γ2. The parameter A relates to the density of chiral 
molecules, 𝜔0 represents the angular frequency of resonance and Γ is the broadening of this 
resonance . All numerical calculations used a single molecular resonance , numerically set at 
𝜔0=3.1 eV (𝜆0=400 nm) with a damping parame ter Γ=0.2 eV.  Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes

Goerlitzer et al.   8 S7. Theory  
 
One could tentatively think that th e observed  chirality transfer  phenomenon can be related to 
an enhancement of the  circular dichroism of the chiral molecules due to the intense near field 
distributions induced on the plasmonic lattice at the different resonances ( Figure 4 e-f). On a 
first approximation, assuming that the molecules cannot alter the optical response of t he 
nanoparticles, the enhancement of molecular CD in complex non -chiral environments can be 
quantified through the electromagnetic density of chirality, normalized to that of a plain circular 
wave in free space (C/C CLP).1,2 It is well known that field -enhanced CD spectroscopy 
necessitates optical antennas supporting both electric and magnetic dipolar resonators. In the 
past, it has been shown that high index nanoparticles1,3 and nanoparticle lattice s4,5 can sustain 
CD enhancement factors which preserve their sign all around the nanoparticles. In our system 
the local electromagnetic density of chirality can be substantially enhanced in certain regions 
of space (See  Supporting Figure 7). Nevertheless, as predicted in Ref  1, due to the electric -
dipolar nature of the plasmonic resonances  excited here and the absence of magnetic -dipolar 
excitations, the lattice sustains positive and negative enhancement regions, and the overall CD 
enhancement cancels out when integrated along a volume surrounding the lattice.  
 
The local  density of optical  chirality,  𝐶(𝑟⃗), defined by 6,7 
 
𝐶(𝑟⃗)≡−𝜔
2𝑐2Im[𝐸⃗⃗∗(𝑟⃗)∙𝐵⃗⃗(𝑟⃗)], (S7.1)  
 
establishes the conditions for enhancing the CD signal when chiral molecules in the vicinity of 
a nonchiral optical resonator  (a plasmonic nanoantenna array, in our case) interacts with the 
local field of the system. In Eq. S7.1, 𝐸⃗⃗ and 𝐵⃗⃗ represent the complex electric and magnetic 
fields, and 𝜔 and 𝑐 are the angular frequency and velocity of light in vacuum, respectively . 
Generally, a favourable contribution to the CD signal is because 𝐶(𝑟⃗) preserves its sign in space 
when the nanostructure is illuminated by circularly polarized light (CPL) of a given handedness. 
Thus, the molecular CD signal can be, in principle, enhance d in all regions of space in the 
presence of optical antennas. In particular, in the presence of nonchiral antennas, we can 
normalize the expression given by eq. S7.1 to that of a plain circular wave in free space, 𝐶cpl=
±𝜖0𝜔
2𝑐𝐸02 (where 𝐸0 is the mag nitude of the incident electric field and 𝜖0 is the permittivity of 
free space). Thus, in these situations, a local CD enhancement factor 𝑓𝐶𝐷(𝑟⃗) can be defined as 
1 
 
𝑓𝐶𝐷(𝑟⃗)=𝐶(𝑟⃗)
|𝐶cpl|=−𝑍0
𝐸02Im[𝐸⃗⃗∗(𝑟⃗)∙𝐵⃗⃗(𝑟⃗)] (S7.2)  
 
with 𝑍0 being the impedance of vacuum.  
 
By integrating over the volume containing the chiral film without the non -chiral nanoparticles 
(normalized to the same volume  𝑉film), we can obtain the total enhancement factor of the CD 
𝑓𝐶𝐷tot, defined as  
 
𝑓𝐶𝐷tot=1
𝑉film∭𝑓𝐶𝐷(𝑟⃗)dV  (S7.3)  
 
Under the assumption that the electromagnetic coupling between the molecules and the 
plasmonic system is very weak,  one can predict the CD signal of the hybrid chiral film -gold NP    SI: Molecular -Induced Chirality Transfer to Plasmonic Lattice Modes    
 
 
Goerlitzer et al.   9 (CD hyb) by multiplying 𝑓𝐶𝐷tot (calculated for the gold NP array without t he chiral film) and the 
CD signal (or differential absorbance A) of the chiral film without NPs  
 
CD hyb=𝑓𝐶𝐷tot∗CD film. 
 
In the case of  a gold sphere array ( D = 90 nm, lattice parameter Dsqu=425 nm) embedded in 
an effective media with n eff=1.518, illuminated with CPL and neglecting the influence of the 
chiral film through electromagnetic coupling, we calculate the 𝑓𝐶𝐷(𝑟⃗) maps at the wavelengths 
of the SLR at 660 nm, the RA at 645 nm and the LSPR at 570 nm as they appear in Supporting 
Figure 7a.  
 
 
Supporting Figure 7 a) Electromagnetic local density of chirality 𝑓𝐶𝐷(𝑟⃗) at interest wavelengths for the gold NP 
array embedded in a matrix with 𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑓=1.518 illuminated with right circularly polarized light. The  AuNP diameter  
is 𝐷=90𝑛𝑚 and the lattice spacing is 𝐷𝑠𝑞𝑢=425 𝑛𝑚. b) Differential absorbance ( ∆𝐴, red continuous line) and 
transmittance ( ∆𝑇, black continuous line) calculated using COMSOL Mul tiphysics and via the total density of 
chirality 𝑓𝐶𝐷tot multiplied by ∆𝐴 (gray dashed lines) and ∆𝑇 (blue dashed lines), respectively.   
 
Because of t he high values of 𝑓𝐶𝐷(𝑟⃗)  around the gold nanoparticle, particularly for those at 
SLR, it is temp ting to think that they may be responsible of the enhancement of the CD signal 
when the NP array is in interaction with the chiral film. Nevertheless, the differential 
absorbance (transmittance) calculated numerically for the chiral film and 𝑓𝐶𝐷tot∗CD film 
(Supporting Figure 7b) turn out to be practically identical, thus indicating that the intense near 
field distributions around the plasmonic lattice are not inducing any enhancement of the 
molecular CD signal. In other words, despite of the high values of  𝑓𝐶𝐷(𝑟⃗), 𝑓𝐶𝐷tot≈1. The lattice 
sustains positive and negative enhancement values of the 𝑓𝐶𝐷(𝑟⃗)  in symmetric regions, 
cancelling out any enhancement when integrated along a volume surrounding the lattice. Thus, 
the local density of chirality does not  amplify the CD signal of the chiral film. This suggests 
that electromagnetic interactions between the chiral molecules and the plasmonic array play a 
crucial role in the experimentally observed chirality transfer phenomenon.  
 
In the following section, we  briefly sketch the field -mediated chirality information transfer 
theory in molecule -nanoparticle hybrids  used to obtain the results presented in Figure 5 of the 
main text. This formalism, originally proposed in Ref.8 (see also9,10), unlike the surface -
enhanced CD effect described in the previous paragraphs, accounts for the electromagnetic 
interactions between chiral molecules and optical resonators.

Goerlitzer et al.   10 Our hybrid system, depicted in Supporting Figure 8, consists of an achiral array of plasmonic 
gold nanoparticles and a chiral film. In the following, we will try to capture  the optical response 
of this system following a simple coupled dipole approach.  
 
We will embed the optical response of the plasmonic lattice in a 6x6 dipolar polarizability.  
  
𝛼𝐴=𝜀0𝜀ℎ(𝛼𝐴𝑒𝛼𝐴𝑒𝑚
𝛼𝐴𝑚𝑒𝛼𝐴𝑚) 
 
Where 𝜀0 is the vacuum permittivity and 𝜀ℎ is the permittivity of the embedding medium (in 
this case 𝜀ℎ=1). The isotropic electric polarizability 𝛼𝐴𝑒, capturing the optical response of the 
plasmonic array, can be described by 3 Lorentzian resonances, one for each lattice resonance 
and another for the LSPR.  
 
𝛼𝐴𝑒=𝑉𝐴(𝐴1𝑒𝑖𝜃1Γ1
(𝜔1−𝜔)+𝑖Γ1+𝐴2𝑒𝑖𝜃2Γ2
(𝜔2−𝜔)+𝑖Γ2+𝐴3𝑒𝑖𝜃3Γ3
(𝜔3−𝜔)+𝑖Γ3)𝕀3 
 
In our calculations we used we used the following values for the variables in order to describe 
the optical properties  of the plasmonic lattice:  
 
𝑉𝐴=4/3𝜋𝑎𝐴3 
𝑎𝐴=500𝑛𝑚 
𝑛𝑚 =10−9 
 
𝐴1=1.8

Goerlitzer et al.   11  
Since the nanoparticle array is plasmonic and achiral, one can safely assume that                    
𝛼𝐴𝑚=0∗𝕀3 and 𝛼𝐴𝑒𝑚=𝛼𝐴𝑚𝑒=0∗𝕀3. 
 
On the other hand, to analytically capture the optical response of the chiral film, we simplify 
the problem and consider the response of a single chiral molecule. To do so, we describe it as 
a chiral, magneto -electric dipole of polarizability:  
 
𝛼𝐵=𝜀0𝜀ℎ(𝛼𝐵𝑒𝛼𝐵𝑒𝑚
𝛼𝐵𝑚𝑒𝛼𝐵𝑚) 
with:  
𝛼𝐵𝑒=𝑉𝐵(𝐴4𝑒𝑖𝜃4Γ4
(𝜔4−𝜔)+𝑖Γ4)𝕀3 
 
𝛼𝐵𝑚=0∗𝕀3 
 
And,  
𝛼𝐵𝑒𝑚=−𝛼𝐵𝑚𝑒=𝑉𝐵(𝐴5𝑒𝑖𝜃5Γ5
(𝜔5−𝜔)+𝑖Γ5)𝕀3 
 
With the following values for the variables taken in order to describe the optical properties of 
the chiral molecule:  
 
𝑉𝐴=4/3𝜋𝑎𝐵3 
𝑎𝐵=5𝑛𝑚 
 
𝐴4=1 
𝐴5=10−3

Γ4=Γ5=𝜔4/50 
 
 
The interaction between the plasmonic  array (A -labeled in Supp. Fig.8) and the chiral molecule 
(B-labeled in Supp. Fig. 8), following reference8, can be captured by the full description of the

𝒫AL/Rand 𝒫BL/R need to be calculated self-consistently. Since the fields scattered by the chiral 
molecule will contribute to the total fields at the position of the optical resonator and vice -versa.  
 
These coupled dipole equations are given by  
 
 𝒫AL/R=𝜀0𝜀m𝜶A(𝜳0L/R(𝐫A)+𝑘2
𝜀0𝜀m𝒢0(𝐫A,𝐫B)𝒫BL/R)  (S8.1 ) 
 
𝒫BL/R=𝜀0𝜀m𝜶B(𝜳0L/R(𝐫B)+𝑘2
𝜀0𝜀m𝒢0(𝐫B,𝐫A)𝒫AL/R).  (S8.2)  
 
In Eqs. S8.1 -2,  𝜳0L/R(𝐫A)=[𝐸𝐴𝑖𝑛𝑐
𝑍ℎ𝐻𝐴𝑖𝑛𝑐]   corresponds to the incident electromagnetic field at the 
position of the optical resonator and  𝜳0L/R(𝐫B)=[𝐸𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑐
𝑍ℎ𝐻𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑐]    to the incident electromagnetic 
field at the position of the chiral molecule. 𝒢0(𝐫i,𝐫j) is the free space Green’s dyadic,  8 k is the 
wave number of light in the medium.  
 
Once the coupled set of equations (S8.1 -2) are solved self -consistently, the extinction cross 
section of the coupled hybrid system can be obtained through the expression:  
 
𝜎ext L/R=𝑘
𝜀0𝜀m|𝐄0L/R|2Im{𝜳0∗L/R(𝐫A)𝒫AL/R+𝜳0∗L/R(𝐫B)𝒫BL/R}  (S8.3)  
 
In Figure 6 of the main text, the differential extinction cross section (Fig. 6d) is obtained from 
the contributions of Left - and Right - Circularly polarized incident light by  
 
Δ𝜎ext,   A,B=𝜎extL−𝜎extR  (S8.4).  
 
The results in Figure 6 prove that chiral molecular resonance, even if largely detuned from the 
plasmonic resonance, is able transfer its chirality via the overlapping of the spectral tail of the 
molecular signal with the plasmonic resonance. Note, that to  capture this chirality transfer 
mechanism it is essential to consider the full electromagnetic coupling between the chiral
