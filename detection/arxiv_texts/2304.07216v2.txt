  Abstract  
Effective placement of emergency rescue resources, particularly with joint suppliers in 
complex disaster scenarios, is crucial for ensuring the reliability, efficiency, and quality of 
emergency rescue activities.  However, limited research has considered the interaction between 
different disasters and material classification, which are highly vital to the emer gency rescue. This 
study provides a novel and practical framework for reliable strategies of emergency rescue under 
complex disaster scenarios.  The study employs a scenario -based approach to represent complex 
disasters, such as earthquakes, mudslides, floo ds, and their interactions. In optimizing the 
placement of emergency resources, the study considers government -owned suppliers, framework 
agreement suppliers, and existing suppliers collectively supporting emergency rescue materials. 
To determine the selec tion of joint suppliers and their corresponding optimal material quantities 
under complex disaster scenarios, the research proposes a multi -objective model that integrates 
cost, fairness, emergency efficiency, and uncertainty into a facility location probl em. Finally, the 
study develops an NSGA -II-XGB algorithm to solve a disaster -prone province example and verify 
the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed multi -objective model and solution methods. The 
results show that the methodology proposed in t his paper can greatly reduce emergency costs, 
rescue time, and the difference between demand and suppliers while maximizing the coverage of 
rescue resources. More importantly, it can optimize the scale of resources by determining the 
location and number of  materials provided by joint suppliers for various kinds of disasters 
simultaneously. This research represents a promising step towards making informed configuration 
decisions in emergency rescue work .

  1.Introduction   
The occurrence of major disasters such as extreme weather, floods, and geological events have 
resulted in significant los s of life and property [1]. Due to the involvement of multiple rescue 
depart ments, the unpredictable nature of disasters, and the uneven distribution of emergency 
supplies, there is a critical need for efficient storage and location selection of emergency 
materials [2]. Current research is focused on developing multi -agent trust systems [3],information 
sharing and coordination [4], and linked storage of materials and equipment [5]. However, the 
current classification standards for emergency supplies are limited [6] and coordinated rescue 
efforts for multi -disaster scenarios are weak [7]. While there has been research on allocating 
emergency resources during the response stage [8-10], insufficient attention has been given to 
resource loca tion planning during the preparation stage [11]. This is crucial for ensuring reliable 
emergency responses. There are several challenges that need to be addressed in  the process of 
selecting emergency rescue sites.  
Firstly, in uncertain scenarios with complex data, the integration of information is often 
delayed [12], and the evolving nature of disasters poses difficulties for storing and allocating 
emergency supplies [13].Therefore, this research focuses on integrating multidimensional disaster 
information and considering how the evolution of disasters impacts emergency material reserve 
strategies.  
Secondly, t he distribution of equipment is uneven, with limited types and insufficient data 
sharing for supporting reserves [14]. This often leads to mismatches between su pply and demand, 
and delays in transportation when allocating emergency materials across regions, resulting in 
failure to deliver emergency materials to the disaster area promptly, and delaying the best time 
for rescue [15]. The existing classification system for emergency suppl ies, based on their uses, is 
inadequate for cross -regional allocation. Therefore, it is urgent to solve the problem of reserve 
network layout and reserve setting and  find a more detailed multi -material collaborative reserve 
strategy.  
Thirdly, multi -link co ordination for disaster rescue is weak, with difficulties in sharing 
emergency resources and low utilization rates [16]. An emergency linkage mechanism needs to be implemented  to store and allocate emergency resources in a unified manner, and enable 
collaborative work among emergency departments.  
To address these issues, this research aims to integrate multi -dimensional disaster information 
and consider the impact of disaster e volution on emergency material reserve strategies. The study 
will also focus on the distribution of emergency equipment and develop a more detailed multi -
material collaborative reserve strategy to enable cross -regional allocation of emergency supplies. 
Moreover, the study will investigate an emergency linkage mechanism to promote collaboration 
and coordination among different emergency departments. The proposed approach combines 
multi -subject suppliers to make unified layout decisions on emergency reserves from a global 
perspective.  
  
Figure.1 Framework of this paper   
In the next section, we motivate our approach by reviewing prior related research. Thereafter, we 
present the structure of our methods including material prediction and classification,  multi -
objective  model  and solution approach . In Section 4, we describe the dataset, and subsequently 
present the result of methodology to verify the proposed model. We  then continue provide 
discussion and concluding remarks in Section 5. The framework of this pap er is shown in 
Figure1.  
  2. Literature review  
2.1 Multiple rescue models  
The fundamental framework for selecting an emergency rescue site comprises the P -median 
model, P -center model, and set coverage model. Scholars have further developed the basic model  
by introducing deterministic models and other variations.  
In the field of earthquake emergency relief planning, various models have been proposed to 
determine the optimal location of relief facilities, pre -storage and response phases, and rescue 
dispatch strategies while considering uncertainties such as demand, supply, cost, facility failure, 
traffic congestion, and queuing delays.  XG A [17]developed a multi -objective location model for 
earthquake emergency relief materials, w hich divided the coverage threshold based on time series 
characteristics and adopted the target deviation rate minimization model and NSGA -II Algorithm 
to solve the problem. The feasibility of the model was verified through a case study in Aba 
Prefecture, Sichuan.  M Haghi [18]proposed a multi -objective programming model to determine the 
location of the rescue cargo distr ibution center, considering pre -disaster and post -disaster 
uncertainties and aiming for fair distribution of relief supplies while minimizing the total cost.  Xie 
[19]proposed a scenario -based stochastic mixed integer nonlinear model that integrate s facility 
disruption risk, traffic congestion, and queuing delays into one model, deriving the expected total 
cost of the system in the fuzzy facility outage scenario and deducing the lower and upper bounds 
of this problem. Sensitivity analysis highlighte d the importance of considering queuing in the 
facility and the quantity of materials in the location selection.  A Dyen [20]established a two -stage 
stochastic mixed integer linear prog ramming model for rescue site selection, aiming to minimize 
the total cost of facility siting, inventory holding, transportation, and shortages while determining 
pre-disaster and post -disaster rescue centers, the number of relief materials in the pre -disas ter 
rescue center, and the shortage of relief materials.  A Bozorgi -Amiri [21] developed an eclectic 
planning model that regards demand, supply, and co st as uncertain parameters in a multi -objective 
model, maximizing the satisfaction of affected areas and minimizing the maximum shortage sum 
as a non -dominated compromise solution.  Ni[22] established  a minimum -maximum robust model 
to optimize the location of facilities in the disaster relief network, the location of emergency stocks, 
and the rescue dispatch strategy, capturing uncertainty in the boundary parameters of the constraint 
conditions. The feasibility of the model was verified through a case study in the 2010 Yushu County earthquake in Qinghai Province. In  terms of multi -party collaborative hierarc hical location 
model, S Tofighi [23]solved a two -tier rescue netwo rk design problem involving multiple central 
warehouses (CWs) and local distribution centers (LDCs), and established a scenario based on two 
stages - Stochastic programming (SBPSP) method, the first stage determines the location and 
inventory level of relie f supplies, taking into account the uncertainty of supply and demand and 
the accessibility of the road network after the earthquake; the second stage, formulate rescue 
distribution plans according to various disaster scenarios , which minimizes the time -weighted, 
total inventory cost, and we ighted shortage cost. JH Zhang [24]considered the joint reserve m odel 
of the government and the agreement supplier, represented the uncertainty of demand based on the 
scene, established a nonlinear mathematical model before and after the disaster to analyze the 
material storage strategy of the government and the agreeme nt supplier, and sensitively related 
param eters gender analysis. Sheu JB [25] proposed a multi -objective programming model for 
global rescue network conf iguration hierarchical network, considering the potential risk cost, 
based on integer programming and hierarchical clustering analysis methods, determined the 
location and quantity of service areas and facilities in the GLS network and coverage, minimize 
network configuration costs, maximize operating profits and customer satisfaction.  
Numerous studies have explored emergency rescue site selection models, which include 
coverage, hierarchical division, and multi -objective optimization. These studies mainly a im to 
ensure the reliability and minimize the uncertainty of emergency rescue site selection. However, 
there is a lack of research that integrates multi -targets from various perspectives, specifically in 
multi -disaster scenarios and multi -type material eme rgency rescue site selection.  
2.2 Multip le types of materials and rescue subjects  
In their research on emergen cy material classification, Hill[26] criticized the current 
standards as insufficient for practical application. They employed the AHP (analytical hierarchy 
process) to conduct qualitative and quantitative research and aggregated the results into a 
classification analysi s. Mete [27]focused on the storage and distribution of medical emergency 
supplies in various disaster scenarios. They developed a stocha stic programming model for 
locating and distributing medical emergency supply facilities, using the example of an earthquake 
in Seattle t o test their approach. X Guan [28] proposed a site selection model for earthquake 
emergency service bases based on a hybrid multi -attribute decision -making method. Their method 
considered the mixed uncertainty of location decision informati on and provided a new weighting method and aggregation process without requiring information transformation. Finally, they 
proved the feasibility and effectiveness of their method using numerical examples.  
The focus  of research on emergency site selection involving multiple parties is typically on 
the emergency response stage. For example, [29, 30] highlig hts the importance of stakeholders 
participating in emergency response and coordinated rescue, based on power, legitimacy, and 
urgency. JH Zhang's research (i ) considers a joint reserve model involving the government and an 
agreement supplier and  establish es a nonlinear mathematical model to analyze the material reserve 
strategy before and after a disaster, along with conducting sensitivity analysis on relevant 
parameters. In the emergency management preparation stage, [31] transformed the site selection 
parameters into decision variables in a multi -party collaborative emergency response decision -
making model and  developed an emergency service facility siting model based on multi -party 
coordination t hat aims to minimize completion time and service acquisition difficulty cost. [32] 
takes a global perspective combined with administrative divisions to examine the layout of site 
selection under emergency linkage, assesses the impact of emergency material classification 
results on site selection decision -making schemes, and ultimately comes up with a provincial and 
municipal reserves site selection decision and resource allocation  scheme. [33] targets the 
characteristics of multi -subjectivity, com plexity, and uncertainty of emergency decision -making 
under unconventional emergencies, and constructs an asymmetric association directed 
collaborative network to select the emergency plan for unconventional emergencies, based on 
individual and collaborati ve information between emergency plans. Previous study also provided 
a guideline for the application of Open AI in medical rescue [34]. The current  research underscores 
the significance of coordinated rescue in emergency response and  analyzes multi -agent rescue in 
site selection p re-storage strategy in terms of parameter determination, collaborative network, 
rescue subject classification, and joint reserve of the government and agreement suppliers. 
However, larger -scale and more complex multi -objective optimization scenarios must b e 
addressed when facing uncertain emergency service needs, such as disaster occurrence time, 
location, consequences, and road network damage.  
The current research suggests a material grading system to classify emergency resources 
based on fuzzy evaluation analysis and analytic hierarchy process. This system provides a 
scientific and rational approach to resource allocation. However, the existing index system lacks 
sufficient secondary indicators and empirical analysis, relying on hypothetical parameters. To  improve the system, this paper aims to refine secondary indicators and adjust site selection model 
parameters using actual data as a reference. When dealing with multiple rescue subjects, it is 
important to consider the construction of a multi -level netwo rk and a model that accounts for 
uncertainty in multiple rescue subjects. However, in cases of larger and more intricate multi -
objective optimization scenarios, the current collaborative research approach among multiple 
parties may no longer be viable.  
2.3 Complex disaster scenarios  
In multi -hazard research, Rawls C G [5]conducted research on selecting locations for 
emergency service facilities in the context of natural  disasters such as hurricanes, using a two -
stage Mixed Integer P rogramming Siting Model. J Shu [35] developed a rescue and supply network 
design model using a variant of the expander graph to minimize costs of emergency facilities and 
supply locations for large -scale disasters such as floods and hurricanes. The proposed model  was 
validated using the 2013 northeas t flood case study. G Erbeyolu [36] proposed an emergency 
rescue location model that considers facility location and inve ntory level, using the benders 
method to find t he optimal solution. Ginger Y [37] examined the impact of system interruption on 
emergency logistics for dangerous goods, and proposed a time -varying risk assessment method 
using a two -stage robust optimization approach. A two -level mixed integer programming model 
was developed, and the model was accurately solved using column and constraint generation 
algorithms. The model was tested on random instances of various sizes.  
Regarding multi -hazard situations, previous studies have presented different categories and 
intensities of disaster scenarios and have identified the uncertain decision -making information 
when facing outages. Nonetheless, there has been limi ted research on how different types of 
disasters interact and their simultaneous occurrence.  
Numerous scholars have extensively researched emergency rescue site selection models and 
algorithms, multi -party collaborative site selection, and material classif ication, among other topics, 
in the literature. Their findings provide the necessary theoretical foundation for selecting 
emergency material sites during times of crisis. This  study builds upon the existing knowledge by 
focusing on the emergency rescue sit e selection model in multi -disaster scenarios. It analyzes the 
systematization and substitutability of disaster emergency supplies' classification and 
classification and develops an emergency equipment reserve layout model based on multi -rescue 
subjects. T his research broadens and deepens the understanding of emergency relief supplies' site selection and reserve models, offering theoretical support for future site selection and layout 
research.  
3. Methods  
Disaster relief requires careful consideration of em ergency resource allocation to minimize 
casualties and economic losses. In recent years, inadequate resource allocation, insufficient 
preparation, and secondary disasters have made rescue operations more difficult. To achieve 
effective disaster relief, it is crucial to study the optimal scale and location of emergency resources.  
3.1 Rescue s trategy under  complex disasters  scenarios  
3.1.1 Coupling degree of complex disasters  
This paper employs the disaster risk coupling matrix technique to perform a comprehensive 
analysis of the consequences of various hazards. Despite the presence of multiple risks, the study 
focuses on examining the interdependent relationship among earthquakes, typhoons, and floods. 
The investigation covers diverse aspects such as the nature and development of disasters, the 
rescue team involved and their necessary reserves, and the utilization of location selection models.  
The gray theory is applied in this research to assess the level of interdependence among 
various disasters [38]. A rating scale ranging from 1 to 9 is employed to construct a decision 
matrix and evaluate the relative significance of each indicator. To begin with, the weight of each 
index is computed by multiplying the row index values of the matrix.  
 M𝑖=∏xijn
i=1(i=1,2,...,n)   （3.1） 
Where, xij is the weight of evaluate index i for disaster j.  
Calculate the nth root of M:  
 W𝑖̅̅̅̅=√M𝑖n   （3.2） 
Determine the weight  matrix : 
 Wi=W𝑖̅̅̅̅/∑√W𝑖nn
i=1    （3.3） 
 λ𝑚𝑎𝑥=1
𝑛∑(BW)𝑖
W𝑖n
i=1  （3.4） 
             BW=[x11⋯x1n
⋮⋱⋮
xm1⋯xmn][W1
⋮
Wn]=(𝑑𝑖1𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑑𝑖2𝑚𝑎𝑥,…,𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑥)𝑇  （3.5） 
Where,  𝑑𝑖1𝑚𝑎𝑥is the optimal vector of the secondary coupling index . Consistency check:  
 CR=λ𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝑛
（n−1）RI （3.6） 
Where,  CR is the random consistency ratio, RI is the random consistency index . 
The correlation calculation formula is as follows:  
 λ𝑖𝑗=min|𝑑𝑖1−𝑑𝑖𝑘𝑚𝑎𝑥|+𝜌max⁡|𝑑𝑖𝑘−𝑑𝑖𝑘𝑚𝑎𝑥|
|𝑑𝑖1−𝑑𝑖𝑘𝑚𝑎𝑥|+𝜌max⁡|𝑑𝑖𝑘−𝑑𝑖𝑘𝑚𝑎𝑥|  （3.7） 
Where, 𝜌 represents the resolution coefficient, usually selects 0.5.  
The coupling degree evaluation matrix is  as follows:  
 P𝑖=(𝜆𝑖1,𝜆𝑖2,…,𝜆𝑖𝑛)𝑇⁡   （3.8） 
Calculate the composite index of the coupling index:  
 X𝑖=W𝑇P𝑖 （3.9） 
Where, X𝑖⁡represents the comprehensive index of the secondary index; W𝑇is the feature 
vector . 
For a comprehensive multi -hazard coupled system, the efficiency function of its coupling 
index can be expressed as:  
 μij=Xij−βij
αij−βij,Xij⁡is⁡positive  （3.10） 
 μij=αij−Xij
αij−βij,Xij⁡is⁡negative  （3.11） 
The values in this paper are as follows: αij=1, βij=0. 
The m ultiple system coupling formula  is as follows : 
 C=√𝑈1𝑈2…𝑈𝑚
∏∏(𝑈𝑖+𝑈𝑗)𝑚
𝑖=1
𝑖≠𝑗𝑚
𝑗=1𝑚 （3.12） 
3.1.2 Material prediction   
The prediction of demand for emergency rescue materials is a crucial aspect of disaster 
response, as it enhances the efficiency of emergency relief and ensures the survival of disaster 
victims. In recent years, the XGboost algorithm has gained popularity a s a machine learning 
algorithm and has proven effective in predicting the demand for emergency relief supplies [39]. 
This article will discuss the selection criteria for utilizing the XGboost algorithm in forecasting the 
demand for emergency relief materials.   
Figure.2 Principle of XGBoost regression model  
The model of XGboost is as follows , which is shown in Figure 2.  
 ŷ=∑𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑖),𝑓𝑘∈𝐹𝐾
𝑘=1  （3.13） 
The model of loss function is as follows:  
 L=∑𝑙(𝑦𝑖,ŷ𝑖)𝑛
𝑖=1   （3.14） 
By minimizing the loss function, the function space set is solved, and the regular term is 
added, the expression is as follows:  
 Obj=∑𝑙(𝑦𝑖,ŷ𝑖)+∑𝛱(𝑓𝑘)𝐾
𝑘=1𝑛
𝑖=1   （3.15） 
If the base model is a tree model, 𝛱(𝑓𝑘) represents the complexity of the tree. In order to 
obtain the optimal solution of the objective function, the forward step -by-step algorithm is adopted, 
and each step is based on the model set of all previous ste ps to further optimize the objective 
function, where the expression of the model at the t  th step is as follows:  
 ŷ𝑖𝑡=∑𝑓𝑘(𝑥𝑖)=ŷ𝑖𝑡−1+𝐾
𝑘=1 𝑓𝑡(𝑥𝑖)  （3.16） 
Where, 𝑔𝑖is the first derivative of the 𝑙(𝑦𝑖,ŷ𝑖𝑡−1) function, and ℎ𝑖 is its second derivative. The 
loss of step t is approximated by the second derivative of the objective function based on the loss 
of the previous t -1 steps. The objective function is only rela ted to the following formula:  
 Obj≈∑𝑙(𝑔𝑖𝑓𝑡(𝑥𝑖)+1
2ℎ𝑖𝑓𝑡(𝑥𝑖)2)+𝛱(𝑓𝑘)𝑛
𝑖=1    （3.17） 
The process of using XGBoost to predict the demand for emergency supplies typically 
involves the following steps  (as shown in Figure 3) : 
 
Figure.3 Steps of XGBoost  regression model  
(1) Collect and prepare data: Gather historical data on factors such as demand, time, and 
location, and perform preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, feature extraction, standardization, 
and handling of missing values.  
(2) Divide dat a set: Split the data set into training and test sets, typically using 80% of the 
data for training and 20% for testing.  
(3) Select features: Choose features that are relevant to demand, such as time, location, and 
weather.  
(4) Adjust parameters: XGBoost h as several adjustable parameters, such as tree depth, 
learning rate, and regularization terms, which require tuning through techniques like cross -
validation to achieve optimal performance.  
(5) Train and predict with the model: Use the training set to train  the model and then use the 
test set for prediction, evaluating the accuracy and performance of the model.  
(6) Optimize the model: Refine the model based on the prediction results, for example by 
adjusting parameters or adding new features.  
(7) Deploy the model: Apply the trained model to real -world scenarios to predict demand for 
emergency supplies and provide timely and accurate supply allocation.  
3.1.3 Material classification  
Intuitionistic Fuzzy Theory is a mathematical technique that addresses uncertainty and 
ambiguity [40]. It has practical applications in emergency response scenarios, whe re rescuers can 
use it to evaluate the similarity and substitutability of different materials during multi -disaster 
rescue operations, through case analysis and summarization [41]. Here are the specific steps 
involved (As shown in Figure 4) : 
 
Figure.4 Steps of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Theory to classify material.  
(1) Identifying the Factors for Decision Making  
To begin with,  it is essential to identify the factors that are critical for making decisions 
regarding the selection of an emergency rescue site. These factors may include the number of 
reserves of rescue supplies, the affected population, the ease of transportation, t he surrounding 
environment, and other relevant factors.  
(2) Defining the Fuzzy Set  
To prevent the negative impact of feature attribute values with varying dimensions on the 
calculation of case similarity, it is crucial to normalize the numerical data first . This will aid in 
defining the fuzzy set.  
 X𝑖𝑗=𝑥𝑖𝑗−𝑥𝑗𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑥𝑗𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝑥𝑗𝑚𝑖𝑛   （3.18） 
To determine the normalization of decision -making factors, it's crucial to identify the fuzzy 
set to which each factor belongs. A fuzzy set categorizes possib le values in a variable based on 
specific rules to create a set . As an instance, transportation convenience levels can be divided into 
four categories: "very convenient," "relatively convenient," "average," and "inconvenient," as 
follows:  
Very convenient - (0, 0, 0.2)  
Convenience - (0.12, 0.32, 0.52)  
Fair - (0.44, 0.64, 0.84)  
Inconvenience - (0.76, 0.96, 1.16, 1.16)  
(3) Membership Function Determination  
A membership function must be established for each fuzzy set, which represents the degree 
of membership w hen the variable takes different values. For example, to determine the degree of 
membership and non -membership for the decision -making factor of traffic convenience, a 
triangular membership function can be employed:  
 𝜗𝐴(x)=
{  (1−x−𝑎
b−𝑎)∗𝐷;𝑎<𝑥<𝑏
(1−c−𝑥
𝑐−𝑏)∗𝐷⁡;𝑏≤𝑥<𝑐
1⁡⁡;⁡⁡⁡⁡𝑖𝑛⁡𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟}  
   （3.19） 
 𝜗𝐴(x)=
{  (1−x−𝑎
b−𝑎)∗𝐷;𝑎<𝑥<𝑏
(1−c−𝑥
𝑐−𝑏)∗𝐷⁡;𝑏≤𝑥<𝑐
1⁡⁡;⁡⁡⁡⁡𝑖𝑛⁡𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟}  
   （3.20） 
Fuzzy logic operations and fuzzy mathematics methods are used to determine the similarity 
of each site selection scheme , where a, b, and c represent the vertices of triangular fuzzy numbers 
and d is a coefficient. This will aid in the calculation of weights for each scheme.  
 Sim(A,B)=(∑𝑤𝑖(min(𝜇𝐴(𝑓𝑖),𝜇𝐵(𝑓𝑖)))𝑛
𝑖=1
∑𝑤𝑖(max(𝜇𝐴(𝑓𝑖),𝜇𝐵(𝑓𝑖)))𝑛
𝑖=1+∑𝑤𝑖(min(𝜗𝐴(𝑓𝑖),𝜗𝐵(𝑓𝑖)))𝑛
𝑖=1
∑𝑤𝑖(max(𝜗𝐴(𝑓𝑖),𝜗𝐵(𝑓𝑖)))𝑛
𝑖=1)/2   （3.21） 
(4) Weight calculation  
Weight is a quantitative value used to describe the degree of influence of each characteristic 
factor on rescue site selection. Emergency rescuers can assign weights to each characteristic f actor 
through expert interviews, questionnaires, etc. . The weight is usually represented by a value 
between 0 and 1, and the sum of the weight values of each characteristic factor is equal to 1. 
Different decision -making factors have different influences on rescue site selection, and 
emergency rescuers need to determine the weight of each decision -making factor.  
The weight 𝑤𝑖∗ determined by the degree of dispersion of attribute values is obtained by the 
following formula:  
 𝑤𝑖∗=s(x𝑖)
∑𝑠(x𝑖)𝑀𝑚=1 （3.22） 
(5) Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation  
After determining the fuzzy set and membership function of each decision -making factor, 
it is necessary to carry out fuzzy comprehensive evaluation on these factors to obtain the 
comprehensive evaluation value of each s ite selection scheme.  
 Comprehensive e valuation value = ∑(𝑤𝑖∗ × Sim(A,B)) （3.23） 3.2 Multi-objective model  
3.2.1 Problem description  
This study presents a multi -objective mathematical programming model that incorporates 
the quantity, location, and allocation of joint suppliers under complex disaster scenarios. The 
objectives of the model include minimizing the cost of emergency resource allocation, maximizing 
the coverage of joint suppliers, minimizing the gap between demand and suppliers, and minim izing 
rescue time.  The Multi -objective model  is shown in Figure 5.  
We consider the joint suppliers for multiple disasters at the same time with different types 
of materials and facilities.  The joint suppliers ensure that government owned suppliers, 
enterprises  and existing suppliers coordinate the material reserves. The rescue agencies provide 
specific and general emergency relief materials. In this approach, companion and converted area 
of materials are considered.  
 
Figure.5 Framework of Multi -objective model  
3.2.2 Model  assumptions  
The multi -objective model is constructed with the following assumptions:  
(1) Assume that the demand  of different materials is given by the decision maker . 
(2) The demand of each disaster area is random, and at least one supply point is served for it.  
(3) The urgency of disaster area obeys a non -convex, non -concave and non -increasing 
function.  
(4) The payment method of the framework agreement suppliers is meas ured in units of 
materials.  
(5) The constructing and operating costs of existing reserves are not considered.  
Considering these assumptions, four objectives are defined for the model including costs, 
fairness, emergency efficiency and uncertainty.

3.2.4 Mathematical modelling  
The multi -objective model of joint suppliers for emergency resource layout under complex 
disaster scenarios is as follows:  
objectives.  
(1) Minimizes total cost of emergency resource layout  
𝑀𝑖𝑛1=∑(𝐵𝑤+∑(𝐺𝑤𝑖×𝑍𝑤𝑖×𝑋𝑤)𝑖∈𝐼 )
𝑤∈𝑊+∑𝑍𝑘𝑖𝑘+∑(∑(𝑋𝑝×𝐵𝑝𝑖)𝑖∈𝐼 )
𝑝∈𝑃（3.1） 
In the selection of emergency resource suppliers, cost  control is an important reference target 
due to the limitation of actual economic capacity. Therefore, in the design of location scheme for 
emergency resource supplier, the use efficiency of funds should be improved and the cost should 
be reduced as far a s possible in the case of meeting the needs. The model of the total cost of the 
cost target is to minimize the emergency resources, which is the first objective function of the 
model. The cost of emergency resource layout mainly includes three parts. The f irst part is 
related to constructing and operating costs of the government owned suppliers. The second part 
of equation (1) implies the cost of materials provided by government owned suppliers and 
framework agreement suppliers.  
(2) Maximizes coverage expectation of alternative supplier s 
 𝑀𝑎𝑥3=∑ (𝐸𝑗×𝑦𝑗𝑓×𝐹(𝑑𝑗𝑓))
𝑗∈𝑊∪𝑃∪𝐾 （3.2） To ensure that all demand areas can receive corresponding emergency resources when facing 
disaster threats, ensuring the fairness of emergency rescue is also an important  goal of the 
problem of emergency resource location selection. Here, the emergency resource utility of each 
demand area is  defined as the degree of satisfaction and coverage of disaster area by suppliers. It 
consists of two parts;  the first part is the rat io of the area covered by radius of the alternative 
suppliers j to the total area of the area. The second part refers to the degree of satisfaction 
covered by supplier j in disaster area f, which is formulated as follows:  
 𝐹(𝑑𝑗𝑓)={1,𝑑𝑗𝑓≤𝑟𝑗𝑓
1−𝑑𝑗𝑓−𝑟𝑗𝑓
𝑅𝑗𝑓−𝑟𝑗𝑓
0,𝑑𝑗𝑓≥𝑅𝑗𝑓,𝑟𝑗𝑓≤𝑑𝑗𝑓≤𝑅𝑗𝑓 （3.3） 
(3) Minimizes the difference between demand and suppliers.   
Min3=(∑(∑(𝑆𝑘𝑖𝑘+𝑍𝑘𝑖)+∑𝑍𝑤𝑖𝑤+∑𝑍𝑝𝑖−∑(𝐷1𝑓𝑖∗𝛼𝑖 𝑓 𝑝 ))+
(∑(∑(𝑆𝑘𝑖𝑘+𝑍𝑘𝑖)+∑𝑍𝑤𝑖𝑤+∑𝑍𝑝𝑖−∑𝐷2𝑓𝑚𝑓 𝑝 ) 𝑖∈𝑀 )𝑖∈𝐶  （3.4） 
The third objective function, which is shown in equation above, minimizes  the difference 
between demand of disaster areas and materials  provided by existing suppliers,  government 
owned suppliers and framework agreement suppliers. In addition,  demand of di saster areas is 
consisting  of general and specific materials.  
(4) Minimizes rescue time  
 𝑀𝑖𝑛4=∑ (𝑦𝑗𝑓×𝑑𝑗𝑓
𝑉𝑗𝑓)
𝑗∈𝑊∪𝑃∪𝐾⁡ （3.5） 
Considering that the important purpose of emergency resource reserve is to save people’s 
lives, and the effectiveness of emergency resources is directly related to the main goal of saving 
lives. The effectiveness of emergency reserve resources is mainly determined by its timeliness. 
Therefore, the fourth objective function minimize sum of the rescue time from suppliers to 
disaster areas.

Constraint (3.6) is the upper and lower bounds the quantitative restrictions of framework 
agreement suppliers. Constraint (3.7) -(3.9) represents that the upper and lower bounds of suppliers. 
Constraint (3.10) -(3.12) controls that the storage capacity of suppliers by the area. Constraint 
(3.13) -(3.14) is specified for the quantity of each material greater than the demand. Constraints 
(3.15) defines that if the specific material m1 is dedicated to the supplier j, then j serves at least 
one demand area f. C onstraint (3.16) expresses that only when supplier j is selected to store 
materials, it is able to serve demand area f. Constraint ( 3.17) implies  that only when supplier j is 
selected, it is able  to store  a certain number  of reserves . Constraint ( 3.18)  ensure s that  at least one 
supplier j serves disaster area f. Constraint (3.19) indicates the binary variables. And ultimately , 
constraint (3.20) are non -negativity constraints.  
3.3 Solution approach  
Due to the multi -objective nature of the present model, o ptimizing one objective function 
may have a negative impact on other objective functions [42]. Therefore, multi -objective 
optimization methods are necessary to obtain a set of solutions that optimize all objective functions 
as much as possible without degrading any one objective function [43]. In a multi -objective optimization problem, the Pareto dominance relation defines a good solution [44]. One solution 
dominates another if it outperforms it in all objective functions, and two solutions are non -
dominated if  neither dominates the other. A Pareto optimal solution is one in which no solution 
can dominate it.  
NSGA -II is a genetic algorithm -based multi -objective optimization algorithm that can 
effectively handle high -dimensional, non -convex, and nonlinear problem s and can generate 
uniformly distributed non -dominated solution sets [45, 46] . The NSGA -II algorithm involves 
several steps  shown in Figure 6.   
 
Figure. 6 Framework of NSGA -II model  
The multi -objective emergency rescue site selection model is a model that selects the optimal 
rescue site selection scheme during the emergency rescue process based on various factors and 
indicators. NSGA -II is a commonly used multi -objective optimization algorithm for optimizing 
multiple objective functions [47]. In the NSGA -II algorith m for the multi -objective emergency 
rescue site selection model, the key operations include encoding the candidate rescue site selection 
schemes into a set of decision variables, randomly generating an initial population, selecting 
individuals using the no n-dominated sorting and crowding distance strategy, performing crossover 
and mutation operations, and performing non -dominated sorting and crowding distance calculation 
to ensure population diversity and distribution [48]. The algorithm is terminated when the preset 
maximum number of iter ations is reached or the population's diversity and distribution meet the 
requirements, and the optimal solution is output . 
4. Numerical study  
To verify the proposed multi -objective  model and its solution algorithm, the following 
calculation examples are s elected for verification . This chapter  begins by analyzing an example to 
validate the algorithm's rationality and applicability based on its research background. The first 
step involves using the XGboost  integrated learning method to predict the demand for disaster 
materials and verifying the case. In the next step, the demand is determined in complex disaster 
scenarios by utilizing the multi -disaster coupling degree and the multi -material alternative 
conversion coefficient. Finally, a multi -objective decision -making model is established to validate 
the pre -storage scheme using the proposed NSAG -II-XGB solution algorithm. Several calculation 
examples are chosen for verification.  
4.1 Data description  and parameter settings  
To verify the proposed multi -objective model and its solution algorithm, the following 
calculation examples are selected for verification. The validity of our model is demonstrated in 
this study using relevant data from a province that is susceptible to disasters. To account for 
limitations in obtaining real data and to focus on a specific scope, we examined three types of 
disasters: earthquakes, floods and mudslides. In addition, we took into consideration the 
interdependent and combined e ffects of multiple disasters. This chapter begins by analyzing an 
example to validate the algorithm's rationality and applicability based on its research background.

4.1.1 Disaster data  
The data source for this article is the disaster data of  Sichuan Province, located in Southwest 
China, from August 23, 2002 to December 30, 2022. The province is prone to natural disasters due 
to its geographical location and terrain conditions, and as a result, the Sichuan Provincial 
Government and relevant ag encies have established a comprehensive disaster point data system to 
effectively monitor and respond to various natural disasters. The article documents the essential 
information of disasters that have occurred in various locations in Sichuan Province, in cluding 
specific location, magnitude, focal depth, and occurrence time. Additionally, the article includes 
fundamental information on the type and severity of disasters, as well as the specific location, scale, 
and shape of  debris flow disasters. Figure 7  illustrates these details.

Following the data preprocessing explained in earlier chapters, the training and testing 
datasets have been created. Table 4 displays the definitions for the disaster point fields.

4.1.2 Supply data  
There are three types of supply points: the provincial government supply point, the contracted 
enterprise reserve point, and the existing supplier. The rescue response point is an established 
infrastructure that provides rescue services and support during emergencies. Governments, non -
governmental organizations, or private institutions usually establish these response points to 
ensure that support and assistance can be quickly and effectively provided in emergency situations. 
Figure 8 illustrates the distri bution of these points.  
 
Figure.8 Distribution of alternative suppliers  
The supply point data includes the material reserve of the material supply point, the type of 
supply point, the location of the supply point, the volume limit, etc. The meaning of the  fields of 
the supply point is shown in Table 7 .

9 Latitude  float 
Various major materials are categorized based on their urgency for emergency rescue and the 
specific types, along with the longest response time, are identified  according to [49].

In this paper, 22 types of materials are classified as either general or special. They are then 
converted based on their emergency classification and substitutability. The area occupied by each 
material is determined by its supporting conditions. Using historical disaster data, the demand for 
materials is predicted using XGBOOST. While there may be some approximation errors in demand 
data, they are not a major concern given the s cope and purpose of the study. The government 
suppliers, agreed suppliers, and existing suppliers provide information on the existing material 
reserves, supply costs, and demand in the disaster area. The reserve situation determines the 
constraints on mate rial supply, as shown in Table 8 . This paper focuses on an area that is susceptible to natural disasters like earthquakes, 
mudslides, and landslides. The study analyzes the supply situation in disaster -prone areas based 
on factors such as disaster points, supply points, and types of supply points. To determine the 
satisfaction level of alternative suppliers and the proportion of the radius coverage area, the 
distance, maximum, and minimum radius from supplier j to disaster area f are calculated using 
ARCGIS . The calculation method considers the speed limit of different types of roads (as detailed 
in Table 9 and Figure  8).

The study involves 22 types of general and special materials. The government -owned 
suppliers and framework agreement suppliers provide  data on existing material storage, cost of 
supplies, and demand in disaster areas. The problem involves 3429 decision variables subject to 
1068 constraints, and potential errors in demand data approximation are acknowledged but are not 
expected to be a si gnificant issue given the scope of the study.  
4.2 Analysis of numerical results  
The Pareto solution set is a useful tool for guiding emergency rescue site selection decisions 
and identifying the best rescue plan. This set comprises solutions that cannot be improved further 
in a multi -objective optimization problem. In the context of s electing a location for emergency 
rescue, the Pareto solution set could include various solutions, each representing a possible 
optimal solution. For instance, in terms of rescue response time and cost, the Pareto solution set 
may consist of solutions with  varying response times and costs. By analyzing the Pareto solution 
set, decision makers can better balance different objectives and choose the most suitable 
solution. This method is highly effective in making trade -offs among multiple objectives and selec ting the optimal solution. This study employs NSGA -II-XGB to solve the emergency rescue 
location problem and finds a total of 40 sets of Pareto so lutions, as depicted in Figure. 9 . 
  
Figure . 9 Parato solutions of Multi -objective model  
The cost of a rescue  operation comprises various elements, such as transportation, 
maintenance, personnel, and equipment. The optimal selection of a rescue site can minimize these 
costs, which in turn affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation. For instance, cho osing 
a site close to the disaster area with convenient transportation can reduce transportation costs, 
selecting appropriate equipment and materials can lower maintenance costs, and deploying 
personnel and resources efficiently can improve overall efficie ncy and reduce costs. When the 
priority is to minimize costs, Pareto analysis shows that schemes 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 21, 29, and 37 provide 
the most cost -effective solutions , one of the solution with scheme 2 is shown in Figure 10 . 
When emphasis is given to cov erage and fairness, it is crucial to choose a site that covers 
the maximum number of affected people and distributes rescue resources fairly across different 
regions. Pareto analysis suggests that schemes 4, 7, 8, 9, 20, 22, 26, 34, and 36 are optimal in t erms 
of coverage and fairness.  
Demand forecasting is crucial when attention is paid to the difference between demand and 
supply. Accurate prediction of rescue site requirements can help relevant organizations to prepare 
in advance, including the deployment  of personnel, materials, and equipment. This can ensure a 
rapid and timely response in the event of an emergency, reducing casualties and property losses. 
Pareto analysis indicates that schemes 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 21, 29, and 37 offer the most accurate predict ion. 
When time is critical, selecting a rescue site promptly is essential. Delays in site selection 
can lead to reduced rescue efficiency and increased risk of casualties. Effective measures need to 
be taken to speed up the response time. Pareto analysis s uggests that schemes 2, 5, 11, 13, 15, 30, 
35 provide the solutions with the shortest rescue time.

5. Conclusion  
After complex disasters occur, difficulties in stockpiling materials arise due to high cost, 
insufficient coverage, and the interaction between different disasters. Relying solely on 
government or contracted suppliers is not enough to meet the needs of mul tiple disaster areas and 
complete the preparation of emergency supplies. Therefore, the selection of agreement suppliers 
and material reserves is crucial to the layout of emergency resources for multiple disasters. A 
multi -objective model that comprehensiv ely considers cost, fairness, emergency efficiency, and 
uncertainty can effectively respond to changes in disaster needs and improve the efficiency of 
emergency rescue.  
To provide reliable strategies for emergency rescue in complex disaster scenarios, this  study 
integrates these factors into a multi -objective model. Using a scenario -based approach to represent 
complex disasters, a multi -objective mathematical model is built to obtain supplier storage 
locations and quantities. This model demonstrates a coope rative response between governments, 
agreements, and existing suppliers for different kinds of disasters. Based on a large dataset of 
disaster -prone provinces, the primary goal of this paper is to minimize the overall expected cost 
with government supplier s, contracted suppliers, and existing suppliers. Additionally, this paper 
considers the supplier's maximum coverage expectation and attempts to use the multi -objective 
model to reduce the difference in material demand forecasting among various suppliers an d the 
rescue time.  
The case analysis shows that the proposed method can estimate the quantity and location of 
material reserves well and can be applied to various types of disaster areas. Therefore, this paper 
provides valuable solutions for the location a nd layout of supplies for government suppliers, 
contract suppliers, and existing suppliers. The NSGA -II-XGB algorithm is proposed and verified 
to perform well in dealing with complex disasters.  
Compared with previous studies [48, 50, 51] , this paper makes several related contributions. 
Firstly, it considers the coupling interaction of complex disaster scenarios and determines the 
impact of the interaction of multiple complex disasters on the location selection of emergency 
rescue. Secondly, it proposes a collaborative response of multipl e rescue subjects based on the 
existing rescue response points. Thirdly, it considers the conversion and substitution of general 
materials and materials in specific disaster scenarios. Finally, the model proposed in this paper 
provides a series of availabl e options for decision according to the distribution of Pareto points 
and the preference of the target.  
However, this study is only a preliminary exploration, and future scholars should conduct a 
more systematic and professional analysis of this topic. One  of the future research directions can 
be to consider different types of vehicles and transportation costs, as well as the routing problem and vehicle scheduling of emergency rescue. Additionally, considering more objective functions 
and proposing a new me ta-heuristic algorithm can also be used as a field of future research.
