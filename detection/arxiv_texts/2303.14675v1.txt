(0;4)Projective Superspaces I:
Interacting Linear Sigma Models
Naveen S. Prabhakar1Martin Ro cek2
We describe the projective superspace approach to supersymmetric models with o-shell (0 ;4)
supersymmetry in two dimensions. In addition to the usual superspace coordinates, projective
superspace has extra bosonic variables { one doublet for each SU(2) in the R-symmetry SU(2) 
SU(2) which are interpreted as homogeneous coordinates on CP1CP1. The superelds are
analytic in the CP1coordinates and this analyticity plays an important role in our description.
For instance, it leads to stringent constraints on the interactions one can write down for a given
supereld content of the model. As an example, we describe in projective superspace Witten's
ADHM sigma model { a linear sigma model with non-derivative interactions whose target is R4
with a Yang-Mills instanton solution. The hyperk ahler nature of target space and the twistor
description of instantons by Ward, and Atiyah, Hitchin, Drinfeld and Manin are natural outputs
of our construction.

21 Introduction
Two dimensional quantum eld theories with chiral supersymmetry have appeared in a variety of
physical and mathematical contexts. The most familiar example is the construction of heterotic
string models which have (0 ;1) supersymmetry on the worldsheet [GHMR85]. Conformal theories
with (0;2) supersymmetry were explored [CHSW85, HW85] in the context of compactications of the
typeR4KwhereKis a compact Calabi-Yau threefold. (0 ;2) Landau-Ginzburg models were also
found to furnish a large class of (0 ;2) heterotic sigma models [DK94]. (0 ;4) worldsheet conformal
theories are also interesting: they describe compactications to six dimensions [BD88, EOTY89,
Sei88] and are useful in worldsheet descriptions of ve-brane instantons [CHS91a, CHS91b].
Since the brane revolution, many two dimensional spacetime models with chiral supersymmetry have
been constructed { these appear as low-energy eective theories on two dimensional intersections of
D-branes or on D1-branes probing manifolds with special holonomy. Depending on the brane setup,
the models on the intersection may have (0 ;1), (0;2), (0;4) or even (0 ;8) supersymmetry [GHM97,
BDL96]. Typically, D-branes have gauge elds as part of their low-energy dynamics and the chiral
supersymmetric theory is a gauged linear sigma model.
For example, a D1-brane probing a Spin(7) manifold has (0 ;1) supersymmetry on its worldvolume
whereas it has (0 ;2) supersymmetry when probing a Calabi-Yau fourfold. The intersection of
two stacks of D5-branes on a two-dimensional plane has (0 ;8) supersymmetry on the common
intersection [IKS06]; including a probe D1-brane on the common intersection gives (0 ;4) susy on
the intersection [GMMS05, Ton14, Nek16, NP17]. Another system of D-branes which has (0 ;4)
susy is the D1D5D9 system which is a D1-brane probe of a gauge theory instanton on R4
realized by the D5 D9 system [Dou98], or instantons on an ALE space realized by taking the four
transverse directions of the D9-brane relative to the D5-brane [DM96]. Other brane realizations
include the worldvolume theory on M5-branes wrapped on a coassociative submanifold of a G2-
manifold which has (0 ;2) supersymmetry [GGP16] and M5-branes wrapped on a four dimensional
submanifold of a Calabi-Yau threefold which has (0 ;4) supersymmetry [MSW97, GGP14, PSY16].
Superspace has proven to be powerful in understanding supersymmetric theories primarily because
it realizes the supersymmetry algebra o-shell. The advantage of an o-shell realization is that,
as long as the constraints on superelds do not themselves introduce interactions, we have a clean
separation of kinematics and dynamics and the sum of two supersymmetric actions is automatically
supersymmetric. This has been useful in uncovering the geometric structures hidden in super-
symmetric theories and also understanding dualities between very dierent-looking models [LR83,
HKLR87]. However, the presence of so-called E-terms can mix dynamics with kinematics, and then
supersymmetry restricts the structure of the action even in superspace; we shall see that this plays
a crucial role in our construction of interacting models.
Superspace descriptions of (0 ;1), (1;1), (0;2), (1;2) and (2;2) theories exist [Sak85, Sie84, FM73,
BW76, Zum75, DS86, Ade+76, BMG86] and are well-understood. For theories with a higher
amount of supersymmetry, for instance (4 ;4) in two dimensions (more generally, theories with eight
3supercharges in other dimensions), it is well known that ordinary superspace is not sucient to
describe o-shell charged hypermultiplets since the superspace constraints for the hypermultiplet
put it on-shell (see [GGRS83, Section 4.6]).
There are at least two approaches that address these issues, harmonic superspace [GIKO+84,
GIOS84] and the closely related isotwistor superspace [Ros83, RS86, Ros85], and projective super-
space [GHR84, KLR84]. All approaches introduce a new set of bosonic coordinates uwhich are
coordinates on an S2. In the harmonic approach the uare viewed as harmonic coordinates on
S2'SU(2)=U(1) where SU(2) is the R-symmetry group or a subgroup thereof, and one considers
superelds which are harmonic functions on S2. In the projective approach, the S2is viewed as
CP1'fC2r0g=C?and theuare homogeneous coordinates on the CP1and the superelds are
analytic functions on CP1. These two approaches are in fact related [Kuz99, JS09].
Projective superspace has been successful in describing many supersymmetric models with eight
supercharges [KLR84, KLR87, IR96, LR88, LR90, LR10, AKL07, GL85, GK99]. In projective
superspace, one can write down new kinds of superelds and superspace constraints which depend
on the coordinates u. More precisely, they are bred over the coset space CP1. Superelds over
projective superspace typically contain an innite number of ordinary superelds (the coecients
in a Taylor expansion in u) and these turn out to be crucial in realizing the o-shell version of the
hypermultiplet. Dynamically, most of these superelds turn out to be auxiliary and thus do not
change the on-shell content of the hypermultiplet.
(0;4) projective superspace has been introduced in [HL17a, HL17b] and has been used to give o-
shell formulations of nonlinear sigma models involving hypermultiplets. In this paper, we describe
linear sigma models with manifest o-shell (0 ;4) supersymmetry in projective superspace.
The R-symmetry of the (0 ;4) supersymmetry algebra is SU(2) SU(2)0and thus one has two projec-
tive superspaces with the CP1s corresponding to the two SU(2) subgroups. The hypermultiplets are
also of two kinds, transforming as a doublet under either SU(2) or SU(2)0. We call them standard
hypermultiplets and, following [Wit95], twisted hypermultiplets respectively. We describe these in
detail in Section 3. We shall see that a hyper can be realized either as a linear polynomial in
the homogeneous coordinates (the O(1) supereld) or as a power series in a local coordinate on
theCP1(the `polar' supereld). O(1) superelds are treated in some detail in [HL17a, HL17b].
(0;p) supersymmetry allows independent fermionic multiplets with chirality opposite to that of the
supercharges. These are the fermi multiplets; we realize them in projective superspace in Section 4.
In (0;2) models, we have interactions of the nonlinear sigma model type or the non-derivative type.
Non-derivative interactions between chiral multiplets, gauge multiplets and fermi multiplets are
described by modifying their superspace constraints with the so-called E-terms, or by including
superpotential-like J-terms in the Lagrangian (see Appendix A.2 of this paper). In Section 5, we
describe the E-term type non-derivative interactions for (0 ;4) models containing standard hypers,
twisted hypers and fermis (it turns out that (0 ;4)J-terms are not possible). In a companion paper
[PR], we describe gauge multiplets and their interactions with hypers and fermis in projective
superspace.
4In Section 6, we describe in projective superspace a prominent (0 ;4) supersymmetric model: a
linear sigma model which ows down to a sigma model with target being an instanton solution
in four dimensions. The couplings of the linear sigma model and the constraints they satisfy as a
consequence of (0 ;4) supersymmetry encode the data that enters ADHM construction of instantons
[AHDM78]. This was demonstrated in (0 ;1) superspace by Witten [Wit95], and it was given a
D-brane interpretation by Douglas [Dou98]. A manifest (0 ;4) construction was given in harmonic
superspace in [GS95, GS96] (see [GR95] for some partial results in ordinary (0 ;4) superspace).
In our construction in (0 ;4) projective superspace, the hyperk ahler nature of the target space is
manifest, and the monads which describe holomorphic bundles on twistor space CP3[AHDM78]
appear explicitly. We also extend this construction to self-dual solutions on R4k0withk0>1, i.e.,
of dimension greater than 4 [CGK85, Wit95].
The appendix includes a quick review of (0 ;1) and (0;2) superspaces (Appendix A), a realization
of the (4;4) hypermultiplet in (4 ;4) projective superspace and its reduction to (0 ;4) projective
superspace (Appendix B), and nally a detailed derivation of the ordinary space component actions
for the general (0 ;4) supersymmetric interacting linear sigma model (Appendix C).
2 (0;4) projective superspace
2.1 Introduction
The (0;4) supersymmetric algebra consists of four real supercharges Q+,= 1;:::; 4, of right-
handed chirality. It is useful to write these real supercharges in terms of a 2 2 matrixQaa0+that
satises the reality conditions
Qaa0+=Qbb0
+"ba"b0a0; (2.1)
whereQbb0
+=(Qbb0+). Here,a= 1;2 anda0= 10;20are SU(2)-doublet indices. The R-symmetry
group is then SO(4) = (SU(2) SU(2))=Z2. We will be interested in the representations of the
supersymmetry algebra which are charged under just one of the SU(2)s and hence it is useful
to consider the double cover Spin(4) SU(2)SU(2) :=FF0. Theaanda0indices are
lowered using the invariant tensors "aband"a0b0which satisfy "ab"bc= ac,"a0b0"b0c0= a0
c0and
"12="1020= +1.
The supersymmetry algebra is
fQaa0+;Qbb0+g= 2i"ab"a0b0@++: (2.2)
(0;4) superspace R1;1j0;4is described by the supercoordinates z= (x;aa0+) wherex=1
2(x0
x1). The corresponding supercovariant derivatives are @=@0@1and Daa0+with the algebra
fDaa0+;Dbb0+g= 2i"ab"a0b0@++;[Daa0+;@] = 0: (2.3)
The derivatives D aa0+also satisfy the same reality condition as for the supersymmetry genera-
tors (2.1). We loosely refer to (2.3) as the supersymmetry algebra though it diers from (2.2) by
5a sign. The supersymmetry generators Qaa0+and the derivatives D aa0+mutually anticommute:
fQaa0+;Dbb0+g= 0.
In this paper, we work exclusively with the derivatives D aa0+rather than the supersymmetry gener-
atorsQaa0+. Supersymmetry transformations of some component of a supereld  can be expressed
in terms of D aa0+because of the following fact which can be easily veried by using the explicit
superspace expressions for Qaa0+and Daa0+:
jjj=
aa0+Qaa0+
jjj=
aa0+Daa0+
jjj; (2.4)
whereaa0+are constant Grassmann parameters, and ( X)jjjstands for the operation of setting the
Grassmann coordinates aa0+to zero in the expression X. The daa0+that appear in the superspace
measure can also replaced by the corresponding D aa0+up to total derivatives1.
It is convenient to dene
D+:= D 110+;D+:= D 220+;Q+:= D 210+;Q+:= D120+: (2.5)
These derivatives span two (anti)commuting (0 ;2) subalgebras:
fD+;D+g= 2i@++;fQ+;Q+g= 2i@++;with other anticommutators equal to zero. (2.6)
2.2 Algebras, superelds and actions
Consider two sets of commuting coordinates uaandva0which are doublets under the R-symmetry
SU(2) subgroups FandF0respectively. These are most usefully interpreted in our context as
homogeneous coordinates on CP1CP10(we label the second CP1asCP10to indicate its relation
toF0). The superspace with the coordinates ( x;aa0+;ua;va0) isR1;1j0;4CP1CP10which we
refer to as projective superspace . The subspaces R1;1j0;4CP1andR1;1j0;4CP10are important
for us.
We also introduce conjugate doubletseuaandeva0which satisfy
"abeuaub= 1; "a0b0eva0vb0= 1: (2.7)
A shift symmetry Note that there is more than one solution to the equation "abeuaub= 1. Ifeub
0
is one solution, then so is eub
0+!ubfor any!2C. Thus there is a shift symmetry on the eua:
eua!eua+!ua;for!2C: (2.8)
There is a similar shift symmetry for the conjugate doublet eva0.
1This is standard procedure, see e.g. [GGRS83].
6Derivatives on projective superspace Consider the derivatives
Da0+:=uaDaa0+;eDa0+:=euaDaa0+;Da+:=va0Daa0+;eDa+:=eva0Daa0+; (2.9)
whereeuaandeva0are any solutions to the equations (2.7). The algebra of the derivatives (2.9) is
obtained from (2.3):
fDa0+;Db0+g= 0;feDa0+;eDb0+g= 0;fDa0+;eDb0+g= 2i"a0b0@++;
fDa+;Db+g= 0;feDa+;eDb+g= 0;fDa+;eDb+g= 2i"ab@++: (2.10)
Note that the shift symmetry (2.8) shifts the derivatives eDa0+by!Da0+but it leaves the algebra
(2.10) unchanged. We shall see below that the action is also invariant under the shift symmetry up
to total derivative terms.
We also introduce the fully contracted derivative
D+=uava0Daa0+=uaDa+=va0Da0+which satises D2
+= 0; (2.11)
due to the anticommutation relations (2.3). We can recover the algebra in (2.10) by writing D2
+=
uaubfDa+;Db+gorD2
+=va0vb0fDa0+;Db0+g.
Projective superelds AnF-projective supereld (z;u) is a function of the superspace coor-
dinatesz= (x;aa0+) and the CP1coordinates uawhich satisfy the following:
(1)is holomorphic in a domain in CP1,
(2)satises the projective constraints Da0+(z;u) = 0,
(3)may be in non-trivial representations of the R-symmetry group SU(2) SU(2)0and the
Lorentz group SO(1 ;1).
AnF0-projective supereld is analogously a function of the superspace coordinates zand the CP10
coordinate va0and is annihilated by Da+. We discuss the dierent types of projective superelds
in Section 2.4.
TheF-projective constraints Da0+(z;u) = 0 can be encoded more economically in terms of the
fully contracted derivative (2.11) D+=va0Da0+:
D+= 0: (2.12)
Since depends only on uand not on v,D+=va0Da0+implies Da0+= 0. The advantage of
(2.12) is that it takes the same form for F0-projective superelds (z;v) as well, since we can now
recover Da+= 0 using D+=uaDa+. We frequently use the derivative D+in the paper.
Actions The constraints Da0+= 0 on a projective supereld imply that depends on
only half of the Grassmann coordinates. The appropriate superspace measure which ensures (0 ;4)
7invariance of an action composed of projective superelds is then quadratic in the derivatives eDa0+,
i.e.,eD10+eD20+. The (0;4) supersymmetric action is then given by
S[] =Z
d2x1
2iI
"abuadubeD10+eD20+K  ()
jjj; (2.13)
where
1.jjjsets all the Grassmann coordinates to zero (we frequently omit the jjjfrom our expressions).
2.K  is the superspace Lagrangian which satises Da0+K  = 0. It must carry the   
Lorentz representation (left-moving part of a vector) in order to compensate the ++ in the
projective superspace measure.
3. The contour 2CP1is chosen to avoid possible singularities in eD10+eD20+K  .
The action is invariant (up to total spacetime derivatives) under the shift symmetry (2.8) eDa0+!
eDa0++!Da0+since the Lagrangian K  satises Da0+K  = 0. Since the superspace measure
"abuadubeD10+eD20+is invariant under FandF0, the action (2.13) is manifestly invariant under F
andF0if the superspace Lagrangian is invariant.
Non-derivative interactions Suppose a projective supereld  sis in the spin srepresentation
of the Lorentz group SO(1 ;1). The requirement that Da0+s= 0 can be relaxed to have a non-zero
right hand side:
Da0+s=Sa0;s+1; (2.14)
whereSa0;s+1is a function of other superelds in the model and is in the spin s+ 1 representation
of SO(1;1). This allows us to introduce interactions (the so-called E-terms) as we will see later in
Section 5:
The modied constraints (2.14) are consistent with the algebra fDa0+;Db0+g= 0 only if the function
satises
Da0+Sb0;s+1+Db0+Sa0;s+1= 0: (2.15)
To ensure (0 ;4) invariance of the action, we require that the superspace Lagrangian K  () satises
Da0+K  = 0 even if Da0+is not zero. This further constrains the Sa0;s+1.
Thus, any (0 ;4) supersymmetric model must satisfy the following constraints:
1. The (0;4) algebra D2
+= 0 must be satised on every supereld in the model,
2. The superspace Lagrangian K  must satisfy Da0+K  = 0 to ensure (0 ;4) supersymmetry
of the action.
These criteria place stringent constraints on the supereld content and the interactions in a model.
82.3 Projective superspace in inhomogeneous coordinates
A primer on CP1The projective space CP1is constructed as the quotient space fC2r0g=,
whereis the following equivalence relation on the coordinates of C2: (u1;u2)(u1;u2),2C?.
We describe CP1in terms of two charts U1andU2:
Ua:=f(u1;u2)2C2jua6= 0g: (2.16)
The mapS2SU(2) which acts on the homogeneous coordinates as
S: 
u1
u2!
7 ! 
0 1
 1 0! 
u1
u2!
= 
 u2
u1!
; (2.17)
interchanges the two charts. Using the equivalence ( u1;u2)(u1;u2),2C?, we can scale out
the non-zero coordinate in each of the charts and obtain a description in terms of inhomogeneous
coordinates:
U1=f(1; )j2Cg;U2=f(;1)j2Cg; (2.18)
with= u2=u1and=u1=u2. On the intersection U12:=U1\U2, the local coordinates and
are related by the Smap (2.17)
S:7 !  1== : (2.19)
We can thus express all our results exclusively in terms of one of the inhomogeneous coordinates,
say, by appending the point =1to the chart U2. We frequently adopt this usage to avoid
cluttering of notation.
The derivatives D a0+,eDa0+We next express the derivatives Da0+andeDa0+in terms of the
local coordinates andin the charts U2andU1respectively. In the chart U2, we haveu26= 0
andua= (u2)(;1). Thus, we can choose eua= (u2) 1(1;0) which indeed satises euaub"ab= 1.
Using the scale invariance ua!ua, we can set u2= 1 as discussed above (2.18). The derivatives
Da0+=uaDaa0+andeDa0+=euaDaa0+are then given by
InU2:D10+=D++ Q +;D20+= Q++D+;eD10+= D +;eD20+= Q+;(2.20)
where we have used the expressions (2.5) for D aa0+. A similar description can be obtained in the
chart U1in whichu16= 0. Writing ua=u1(1; ), choosingeua= (u1) 1(0; 1) and setting u1= 1
by scale invariance, we have
InU1:D10+= D + Q+;D20+= Q+ D+;eD10+= Q+;eD20+= D+:(2.21)
Observe that, in the intersection U12, the derivatives Da0+() dened in U1are related to the Da0+()
dened in U2as
Da0+() = ( )Da0+(()); (2.22)
which is the gluing rule for a global section of the line bundle O(1)!CP1(we have used that
() =  1on the overlap).
9Similarly, the derivatives eDa0+() inU1andeDa0+() inU2are related on the overlap as
eDa0+() = ( ) 1eDa0+(()) + 1Da0+() = ( ) 1eDa0+(()) Da0+(()); (2.23)
where we have used (2.22) in going to the last expression. The transformation (2.23) can be viewed
as the usual transformation of a section of O( 1) plus a shift term proportional to Da0+generated
by the shift symmetry (2.8). This allows us to dene eDa0+globally on CP1, not as a section of
O( 1) but as a section of the ane bundle modelled on O( 1).
Note: There is an alternate way of writing the (0 ;4) algebra using the derivatives Da0+and@
@:
fDa0+;[@;Db0+]g= 2i"a0b0@++: (2.24)
Thus, one may use the derivatives Da0+and@=@ instead of Da0+andeDa0+in describing projective
superspace. Observe that @Db0+coincides with eDb0+inU1and@Db0+coincides with eDb0+inU2.
Further,@Da0+also satises the rule (2.23). However, this is expected since the derivative of a
section ofO(1) transforms as a section of the ane bundle modelled on O( 1).
A (0;2) action which is (0 ;4) supersymmetric Plugging in the derivatives (2.20) in the
action (2.13), we get
S[] =Z
d2xI
d
2iD+Q+K  (): (2.25)
We can also rewrite the above action in (0 ;2) superspace. Using  D+=  1D++ 1D20+and
Da0+K  = 0, we get
S[] =Z

F0-projective superspace For completeness, we explicitly describe some analogous aspects of
F0-projective superspace. We have the inhomogeneous coordinate 0for the CP1corresponding
to theF0doubletva0. We then choose va0= (0;1) andeva0= (1;0) using the scale invariance
va0!0va0,02C?. TheF0-projective derivatives Da+andeDa+are then
D1+=0D+ Q+;D2+=0Q++D+;eD1+= D +;eD2+= Q +: (2.27)

102.4 Analytic structure of projective superelds
Recall that F-projective superelds are holomorphic in a connected open subset of CP1and that
they are annihilated by the derivatives Da0+. We now describe the dierent types of projective
superelds which dier in their analytic structure on the CP1.F0-projective superelds are dened
analogously.
O(p) superelds The supereld is a homogeneous polynomial in the uaof degreep>0:
(z;u) =a1ap(z)ua1uap=pX
i=0i(z)(u1)i(u2)p i: (2.30)
The components a1ap(z) are ordinary (0 ;4) superelds, i.e., functions on R1;1j0;4. Note thatis
a global section of the line bundle O(p)!CP1. We thus call such superelds O(p) superelds .
In the chart U2whereu26= 0 we can write as
(z;u) = (u2)p(z;) = (u2)ppX
j=0j(z)j; (2.31)
which becomes a polynomial in the inhomogeneous coordinate =u1=u2when we set u2= 1.
Meromorphic O(n) superelds TheO(n) superelds discussed above are global holomorphic
sections ofO(n)!CP1. We can consider more general superelds which are only local sections
ofO(n) and cannot be extended to all of CP1. A familiar class of examples are the meromorphic
sections ofO(n) which are rational functions of ua:
(z;u) =P(z;u)
Q(z;u)=Pi1ip(z)ui1uip
Qi1iq(z)ui1uiq; (2.32)
wherePandQare homogeneous polynomials of degree pandqrespectively. The domain of
denitionDofonCP1is restricted to the open set where Q(z;u)6= 0. The degree of homogeneity
ofis thenn=p qand thusis a local section of O(p q)!CP1dened onD. In terms of
the inhomogeneous coordinate , we have
(z;) =a0(z) +a1(z)++ap(z)p
b0(z) +b1(z)++bq(z)q; (2.33)
where theai(z) are appropriate combinations of Pi1ip(z) and similarly, bi(z) are combinations of
theQi1iq.
Local superelds Consider superelds which are formal power series in or 1or both. These
appear as series expansions of local holomorphic sections in the neighbourhoods of = 0,=1or
in the annulus CP1rf0;1g. Consider a power series in :
(z;) =1X
j=0j(z)j: (2.34)
11Such superelds shall be termed arctic since they are well-dened at the north pole = 0 of CP1
(and possibly in a neighbourhood of = 0 as well). Similarly, a supereld which is a power series
in 1is designated antarctic .
Finally, a supereld which is dened in the annulus and is real under the extended complex conju-
gation given below in Section 2.6 is called equatorial .
2.5 R-symmetry in projective superspace
We consider the R-symmetry transformation of the various objects in projective superspace for
the subgroup F= SU(2) in this subsection [KLR84] (the discussion for F0= SU(2)0proceeds
analogously). The homogeneous coordinates ua= (u1;u2) onCP1transforms as a doublet under
F:
uc!(gu)c=gcdud; g = 
a b
 ba!
withaa+bb= 1: (2.35)
Accordingly, the inhomogeneous coordinate =u1=u2transforms fractional-linearly:
!g=a+b
 b+a: (2.36)
Also, a doublet ua="abubwith a lower index atransforms as
ua!(gu)a:=ub(g 1)ba: (2.37)
Factor of automorphy We dene a factor of automorphy j:FCP1!Cfor the action of F
onCP1as follows. Let g= 
a b
 ba!
2Fand2CP1. Then we have
j(g;) := (a b): (2.38)
It is easy to check that j(g;) satisesj(g1g2;) =j(g1;g2)j(g2;). Suppose we have an object
() that depends holomorphically on . The transformation of by aF-transformation gis
denoted by g. An object () is said to have F-weightnif it satises
() =j(g;)n[g](g); g2F ; (2.39)
That is, is a local section of the line bundle O(n)!CP1. Note that weight 0 objects are simply
local functions on CP1.
Next, we describe the R-symmetry ofO(n) superelds and arctic superelds.
O(n) superelds Consider anO(n) supereldgiven by(u) =a1:::anua1uan. Since all
F-doublet indices are contracted in (u), it is invariant under F. That is,
(u) = [g](gu); g2F ; (2.40)
12where [g](gu) on the right hand side is a new O(n) supereld [ g] obtained by transform-
ing the components a1an, and evaluated at the transformed coordinates gu. In terms of the
inhomogeneous coordinate , we have
(u) := (u2)n();with() :=nX
j=0jj; (2.41)
wherejare appropriate combinations of the a1an. Similarly,
[g](gu) = (au2 bu1)ng(g) = (u2)nj(g;)n[g](g): (2.42)
This leads to
() =j(g;)n[g](g): (2.43)
We dene the transformation of a O(n) supereld() by an element g2Fas
()![g 1]() :=j(g;)n(g); (2.44)
where the right hand side must be expanded about = 0 so that it is a function of rather than
g. Thus, anO(n) supereld has weight n(note that this is also the degree of the line bundle
O(n)!CP1). Meromorphic sections of O(n) also transform similarly under R-symmetry.
An example We are primarily interested in describing hypermultiplets which correspond to n= 1.
In this case the components aof(z;u) =a(z)uatransform as an F-doublet. We check that 
satises (2.43) for n= 1:
j(g;)[g](g) = (a1+b2)(a+b) + ( b1+a2)(a b) =1+2=();(2.45)
where we have used the SU(2) transformation of a doublet awith a lower index as described in
eq. (2.37). It can be easily checked that the conjugate =1 2(cf. (2.64)) also transforms as
anO(1) multiplet.
Arctic superelds Arctic superelds are typically dened only in a neighbourhood of = 0 and
not globally on CP1. As a result, we may only consider innitesimal R-symmetry transformations
of arctic superelds since they retain in a neighbourhood of = 0. These we obtain by setting
a= 1+iandb=, withandinnitesimal, in the formula for the F-transformation gin (2.35).
The determinant condition aa+bb= 1 then gives i(  ) = 0 to rst order in the innitesimals,
i.e.,is real. The innitesimal F-transformation of is then (cf. [LR10])
=+ 2i+2: (2.46)
TheF-transformation of an arctic supereld () =P1
0jjofweightkis then given by the
innitesimal version of [ g 1]() =j(g;)k(g):
() = k(i+)() +@
@ ; k2Z: (2.47)
13It is important to note that arctic superelds can be assigned any integral weight ka priori since
arctics go to arctics under innitesimal transformations for any kin eq. (2.47)2. Further, it is easy
to check that k(  1) also transforms as an object of weight kbut is no longer an antarctic
supereld.
The components jtransform under (2.47) as
j= (j+ 1)j+1+ (2j k)j+ (j 1 k)j 1: (2.48)
Let us look at k= 1 which will be required in our study of hypermultiplets. We shall show below
that, with our choice of action for the arctic supereld, the components j2will turn out to be
auxiliary and will be set to zero by their equations of motion. The arctic supereld then truncates
to anO(1) supereld after substituting j2= 0. It is then clear that the components 0and1
decouple from the j2components in (2.48) and 0and1transform as
0= 0+1;  1=1 0: (2.49)
These are the transformation rules for an F-doublet (1;0) and this is the standard transformation
of a hypermultiplet under SU(2) R-symmetry.
The derivatives D a0+,eDa0+Since Da0+=uaDaa0+, the same manipulations we did for O(n)
superelds works here and it follows from (2.43) that Da0+hasF-weight +1. Let us next discuss
theF-weight ofeDa0+. Recall from the discussion above equation (2.20) that our chosen solution
for the equation "abeuaub= 1 is
eua= (u2) 1 
1
0!
;givenua= 
u1
u2!
=u2 

1!
: (2.50)
UnderF-transformations, since u2transforms as u2!j(g;)u2,uaandeuatransform as
eua!j(g;) 1(u2) 1 
1
0!
; ua!j(g;)u2 a+b
a b
1!
: (2.51)
From this, it is clear that eDa0+hasF-weight 1. This is consistent with the algebra fDa0+;eDb0+g=
 2i"a0b0@++since the right hand side is independent of and hence, has weight 0.
However, the transformation (2.51) of euadoes not look like that of an F-doublet. The latter looks
like
eua! 
a(u2) 1
 b(u2) 1!
: (2.52)
How do we reconcile (2.51) and (2.52)? Recall that we had a shift symmetry (2.8) eua=!uain the
space ofeuathat satisfy "abeuaub= 1. We could add a shift in one of the transformations, say (2.51)
2Explicitly, we have
= [g 1]() () = (1  ki k)
() +@
@
 () = k(i+)() +@
@ :
Clearly, the right hand side is also an arctic supereld.
14and see if that can be matched with (2.52) for a particular value of the shift parameter. Indeed,
writing
j(g;) 1(u2) 1 
1
0!
+!j(g;)u2 a+b
a b

= (u2) 1 
a

; (2.53)
we get a solution for !
!= b(u2) 2j(g;) 1: (2.54)
In analogy with (2.44), we dene the transformations of the Da0+andeDa0+expressed in inhomo-
geneous coordinates as
Da0+()!j(g;)Da0+(g);eDa0+()!j(g;) 1eDa0+(g) bDa0+(g): (2.55)
The projective superspace measure Recall that the (0 ;4) projective superspace action (2.13)
is
S[] =Z
d2x1
2iI
"abuadubeD10+eD20+K  (): (2.56)
As discussed after (2.13), the action is manifestly FandF0invariant provided the superspace
LagrangianK  is invariant. In terms of F-weight, it has weight 0 since the measure uadubhas
two factors of uaandeD10+eD20+has two factors of eua. Let us elaborate in terms of inhomogeneous
coordinates. The action takes the form
S[] =Z
d2xI
d
2ieD10+eD20+K  (): (2.57)
The measure d transforms with F-weight 2 under an F-transformation !g:
d=j(g;)2d(g): (2.58)
The superderivatives eDa0+eectively transform with F-weight 1 (cf. the rst term in the transfor-
mation ofeDa0+in (2.55); the second term in (2.55) is proportional to Da0+which annihilates K  ).
As a result, the combination d eD10+eD20+has weight 0, i.e., the superspace measure is invariant
(up to total derivatives). Since integrating a weight 0 object with the invariant measure yields an
F-invariant answer, the action is R-symmetric if the superspace Lagrangian K  has weight 0.
2.6 Extended complex conjugation
Recall theSmap (2.17) which takes !  1=. The antipodal mapIthat takes a point on CP1
to its antipode is the composition of the Smap and complex conjugation:
I: 
u1
u2!
7 ! 
 (u2)
(u1)!
;that isI:7 ! 1
: (2.59)
The antipodal map can be used to dene a new real structure [LR88] on the (sheaf of) sections
of a line bundle as the action of the antipodal map on a section followed by ordinary complex
conjugation of the resulting section.
15For instance, the antipodal map acts on an arctic supereld () =P
j0jj(which is a local
section of some line bundle on CP1) as
X
j0jj!X
j0j( ) j: (2.60)
Ordinary complex conjugation of the resulting local section is
X
j0j( ) j!X
j0j( ) j: (2.61)
Thus, the extended complex conjugate of an arctic supereld () is
( 1=) :=X
j0j( 1=)j: (2.62)
Let us compute the extended complex conjugate of an O(p) supereld. Sinceis globally dened
onCP1, and the antipodal map contains the Smap, we can use the F-transformation rule (2.44)
forO(p) superelds to obtain the extended complex conjugate:
(z;) =pX
j=0j(z)jI7 !( )ppX
j=0j(z)( ) j c.c.7 !pX
j=0j(z)( )p j: (2.63)
The dierence between the above and (2.62) is that there is an additional factor of (  )pin the
antipodal map step. This factor makes the new section also a global section of O(p). Thus, the
extended complex conjugate of an O(p) supereldis
(z;) :=pX
j=0j(z)( )p j: (2.64)
A reality condition As is obvious from (2.64), the extended conjugate of an O(p) supereld is
also anO(p) supereld. Notice that applying the extended complex conjugate twice on gives
= ( 1)p: (2.65)
Thus, we can impose a reality condition on anO(p) supereld only when pis even:
() =();that is,pX
j=0j(z)j=pX
j=0j(z)( )p j: (2.66)
Extended complex conjugates of D a0+andeDa0+Next, consider the derivatives Da0+and
eDa0+. Since they are globally dened (see the equations (2.22), (2.23) and the discussion around
them), we use the global F-transformation rules in (2.55) to get the conjugates. The factor of
automorphy for the S-map isj(S;) = . The complex conjugate of Da0+is then
Da0+I7 ! (  1D1a0++ D 2a0+)c:c:7 ! (  1D1a0++D2a0+)
="a0b0(D2b0++D1b0+) ="a0b0Db0+:(2.67)
16The complex conjugate of eDa0+is obtained as follows. First, we apply the antipodal map:
eDa0+I7 !( ) 1eDa0+(  1) Da0+(  1) = ( ) 1D1a0+ (  1D1a0++ D 2a0+) = D2a0+:
(2.68)
where we have used the fact that since the eDa0+are independent of , the expressions for eDa0+(  1)
are the same as in (2.20), i.e., eDa0+(  1) = D 1a0+. Next, doing ordinary complex conjugation, we
get
 D2a0+c:c:7 !"a0b0D1b0+="a0b0eDb0+: (2.69)
Thus, we have
Da0
+="a0b0Db0+;eDa0
+="a0b0eDb0+: (2.70)
We may need to consider a slightly dierent version of the complex conjugates of the derivatives
when they act on arctic superelds for the following reason. Under extended complex conjugation,
an arctic supereld goes to an antarctic supereld (see (2.62)). We would like this to be true for
the derivative of an arctic as well. However, applying (2.70) on Da0+gives"a0b0Db0+which is
not antarctic due to a term proportional to inDb0+. On the other hand, treating Da0+as a new
arctic supereld with components
Da0+() =X
j0(D1a0++ D 2a0+)jj=X
j0j(D2a0+j+ D 1a0+j 1); (2.71)
we can apply the conjugation rule (2.62) to the above and obtain
X
j0( 1=)j"a0b0( D1b0+j+ D 2a0+j 1); (2.72)
as the conjugate antarctic supereld corresponding to Da0+. Clearly, (2.72) can be written as
"a0b0( D1b0+  1D2b0+)X
j0( 1=)jj=  1"a0b0Db0+( 1=); (2.73)
which suggests that we modify the conjugate of the derivative Da0+when acting on arctic superelds
to
Da0+!Da0+=  1"a0b0Db0+: (2.74)
Similarly, we have
eDa0+() =X
j0jD1a0+j: (2.75)
Applying (2.62) to the above, we get
X
j0( 1=)j"a0b0D2b0+j: (2.76)
Note the identity
D2b0+= D1b0++Db0+= eDb0++Db0+: (2.77)
This allows us to write (2.76) as
X
j0( 1=)j"a0b0D2b0+j="a0b0( eDb0++Db0+)( 1=); (2.78)
17which suggests the modication
eDa0+!eDa0+="a0b0( eDb0++Db0+): (2.79)
Thus, on arctic superelds, we can postulate the following modied extended complex conjugates
of the derivatives:
Da0
+=  1"a0b0Db0+;eDa0
+="a0b0( eDb0++Db0+): (2.80)
The notation  for the above notion of the extended complex conjugate of a derivative has been used
earlier in [Kuz99] and has been called `smile conjugation'; we continue to use the same notation in
this paper. Note that the smile conjugation simply treats Da0+() andeDa0+() as local sections
and applies the conjugation rule (2.62).
3 Hypermultiplets
The dynamical degrees of freedom of a (0 ;4) hypermultiplet consists of two (0 ;2) chiral superelds
andsuch that (;) form an SU(2) doublet. The SU(2) in question can be either ForF0and
the corresponding hypers are called standard and twisted hypermultiplets respectively. A standard
hypermultiplet3can be described in (0 ;4) projective superspace either by an O(1) supereld [HL17a]
or by a pair of F-arctic superelds ( ;  ). The analogous notation for the twisted hypers is O(1)0
andF0-arctic respectively. We describe free hypermultiplets in this section and study interactions
in Section 5.
3.1 Standard hypermultiplets
3.1.1 O(1) supereld
We start with a complex O(1) supereld =aua. In terms of the inhomogeneous coordinate ,
we haveua= (;1) and
() =2+1;() =1 2: (3.1)
The projective constraints Da0+= 0 give the following constraints on 1and2:
Q+1= 0;D+1= 0;D+2= 0;Q+2= 0;Q+2=D+1;Q+1= D+2:(3.2)
We see that 1and2are (0;2) chiral superelds since D+annihilates them. See Appendix A.2 for
a review of (0 ;2) superspace.
The superpartner fermions are dened as4
p
2a0+:=eDa0+;p
2a0
+:= "a0b0eDb0+: (3.3)
3See also [GR95] for a discussion in ordinary superspace.
4The conjugate fermions are obtained as follows. eDa0+is best thought of as [ eDa0+;] which, under conjugation,
goes to [ ;(eDa0+)] =  "a0c0eDc0+.
18The superpartners a0+are in the doublet of F0; they are also independent of since the above
combinations are globally dened weight 0 superelds, i.e., global holomorphic functions on CP1
which are indeed constants in . Using the expressions eDa0+= D 1a0+and that Da0+= 0, we can
arrive at the following (0 ;2) superspace denitions for the a0+:
p
210+= D +2;p
210
+= D+2; p
220+=D+1;p
220
+= D +1: (3.4)
The next supereld in the multiplet would be eDa0+eDb0+which (1) is globally dened on CP1,
(2) hasF-weight 1, (3) is antisymmetric in a0b0, and (4) is a Lorentz vector. The only supereld
which satises all these properties is "a0b0@++e, wheree=euaa. Thus, we have
eDa0+eDb0+= 2i"a0b0@++e;eDa0+eDb0+= 2i"a0b0@++e: (3.5)
The above equations (3.5) can be explicitly checked by using the expressions for eDa0+in (2.20), the
complex conjugate derivatives in (2.70), and the projective constraints (3.2).
The (0;4) supersymmetric action that describes the (free) hypermultiplet is
S= i

2ieD10+eD20+( 1@  ): (3.6)
Using the fact that the superspace Lagrangian is annihilated by Da0+, we can write it as an action
in (0;2) superspace as in (2.26). We get
S=i
2Z
d2xI
d
2iD+D+( 1@  ): (3.7)
Next, we can obtain the component action by rst performing the -integral, pushing in the deriva-
tives and using the denitions (3.4) and that 1and2are (0;2) chiral superelds:

+@  a0+): (3.8)
(See Appendix A.2 for a derivation of the component action from the (0 ;2) action in the second
line in (3.8).) We can also obtain the same component action as above by pushing in the deriva-
tiveseD10+eD20+in (3.6), use the denitions (3.3) and (3.5), and nally perform the integral (see
Appendix C.2).
TheO(1) supereld can be described in ordinary (0 ;4) superspace as well. Writing Da0+=uaDaa0+
and=uaa, the projective constraints Da0+= 0 are equivalent to
Daa0+b+ Dba0+a= 0: (3.9)
As noted in [HL17a], in contrast to an O(1) supereld in (4 ;4) projective superspace, the above
(0;4) constraints do not put the O(1) supereld on-shell. Only the antisymmetric part in abof
Daa0+bis non-zero and it gives the superpartner fermions dened in (3.3) (or equivalently (3.4)):
Daa0+b=:p
2"aba0+;p
2"aba0
+= "ac"a0c0Dcc0+b: (3.10)
19Note that the scalars aare in anF-doublet whereas the fermions a0+are in anF0-doublet.
Recall from (3.2) that 1and2are annihilated by D+and Q +. Thus, we can write down a
manifestly (0 ;4) supersymmetric action with the measure D +Q+:
S=i
2Z
d2xD+Q+(1@  2): (3.11)
This is the projective superspace action (3.6) after plugging in eD10+= D +,eD20+= Q+and
performing the integral; therefore, it also coincides with the (0 ;2) action (3.7). The above action
is not manifestly R-symmetric, but a manifestly R-symmetric action also exists which agrees with
any of the above actions (up to total spacetime derivatives):
S=i
2Z
d2x"a0b0Daa0+Dbb0+(a@  "bcc): (3.12)
However, the above action is not manifestly supersymmetric since the measure does not involve all
four superspace derivatives.
TheF-projective superspace action (3.6) does not seem to be invariant under R-symmetry since
the Lagrangian does not seem to transform with F-weight 0. To write a manifestly R-symmetric
action in projective superspace, we use the arctic realization of the hypermultiplet, one that arises
naturally from (4 ;4) projective superspace (see Appendix B.2).
3.1.2 Arctic supereld

and similarly for   . The zeroth components 0and0  are (0;2) chiral superelds since

20Since thej  ,j1, are unconstrained as (0 ;2) superelds, we can integrate them out in the
above superspace action. This imposes j+1=j+1= 0 forj1 and retains only the 0and1
terms in . Integrating out j+1, we getj  =i
2@  j+1forj1. We cannot integrate out
0  in the same way and set 1= 0 since0  is constrained as a (0 ;2) supereld, D+0  = 0.
Instead, integrating out the constrained supereld 0  constrains1to satisfy D+1= 0.5
Thus, we have two (0 ;2) chiral superelds 0and1which we relabel as 2and1respectively
to make contact with the O(1) supereld terminology (3.1). Thus, becomes anO(1) supereld
when we go partially on-shell by integrating out the auxiliary supereld   :
=0+1=1+2;=2  11=  1(1 2); (3.17)
and the action (3.15) becomes the O(1) action (3.8):

Since integrating out   gives anO(1) supereld, it is consistent to give an F-weight of +1 to
. However, the action does not seem to have F-weight 0 and hence does not appear R-symmetric.
But the action in ordinary space (3.18) is certainly R-symmetric! Let us see how to understand the
R-symmetry of (3.15).
The terms depending on   can be made to have weight 0 by declaring that   is a weight 1
supereld. However, the kinetic term is still a problem. Since   is an auxiliary supereld, we
can give it a non-standard R-symmetry transformation so that it cancels that of the kinetic term
(this is motivated from the (4 ;4)!(0;4) reduction in Appendix B.2):

Recall that we must only perform innitesimal F-transformations on arctic superelds (see the
discussion above eq. (2.46)). It is easy to check that the Lagrangian (3.15) transforms with weight
zero when we transform   according to the above rule (see Appendix B.2 for an explicit demon-
stration).
We could write down the (0 ;4) descendants directly by acting on and  with the derivatives
eDa0+. We could then compute the component action (3.18) by pushing the derivatives in the
measureeD10+eD20+into the Lagrangian in the (0 ;4) action (3.15) and using the denition of the
(0;4) descendants. This procedure results in the same conclusions, namely that is truncated to an
O(1) supereld and   is auxiliary, and hence we do not describe it here. However, see Appendix
C.2 for an illustration of this method for an arctic fermi supereld.
5Here is the procedure to integrate out a constrained supereld: we rst relax the constraint on 0  and introduce
a Lagrange multiplier supereld   : D+D+ 
10  +  (D+0  )
. Integrating out   re-imposes the constraint
D+0  = 0 whereas integrating out 0  gives1= D+ , which indeed satises D+1= 0. We can conclude the
same by going down to components, or at an intermediate stage by pushing in D+in the rst term in the Lagrangian
(3.16) to get  D+ 
(D+1)0  
. Since the remaining measure D +does not kill 0  , we can integrate it out to
conclude that D+1= 0.
213.2 Twisted hypermultiplets
A twisted hypermultiplet is described by a complex O(1)0supereldH(0) that is specied as
H(0) =0H10+H20;H(0) = 0H20+H10: (3.20)
TheF0-projective constraints Da+H= 0 are given by
Q+H20= 0;D+H20= 0;Q+H10= 0;D+H10= 0;Q+H10= D +H20;Q+H20= D+H10:
(3.21)
H10andH20are (0;2) chiral superelds since D+annihilates them. As for the standard hyper, the
superpartner fermions are dened by
Daa0+Hb0=p
2"a0b0a+: (3.22)
The above denition makes it clear that the superpartner fermions a+ofHa0are in the doublet of
F. Explicitly, we have
p

22+= D+H10;p

which is the action for two (0 ;2) chiral multiplets H10andH20. TheHa0form anF0-doublet
and hence, the above multiplet describes a twisted hyper. The description in terms of F0-arctic
superelds is analogous to that of the standard hyper.
4 Fermi multiplets
In this section, we describe matter fermi multiplets. We focus on F-projective fermi superelds
below; theF0-case follows analogously. Like hypermultiplets, fermi multiplets can be realized either
asO(n) superelds or F-arctic superelds. We only describe arctic superelds here since all our
constructions use only those and not the O(n) superelds.

In the last step, we have integrated out the (0,2) unconstrained superelds j withj1. Note
that this is consistent with the F-transformations discussed in Section 2.5 only for weight k= 0.
In more detail, the Ftransformation rules for the elds j in (2.48) preserve the auxiliary eld
equationsj = 0,j1, only for weight 0.
To get the component action, we push the measure derivatives D +D+into the Lagrangian:
S=Z
d2x(GG+ i@++    ); (4.4)
where the auxiliary eld Gis dened as p
2G= D +  . In Appendix C.2, we dene the ordinary
space components of  directly without going to (0 ;2) superspace by acting on  witheDa0+
successively. We also compute the above component action by directly pushing in the (0 ;4) measure
eD10+eD20+in (4.3) and using the denitions of the components that were just alluded to, and nally
perform the -integral.
5 Interactions
The criteria for (0 ;4) supersymmetry are closure of the algebra D2
+= 0 on all the superelds and the
invariance of the action (see the comments at the end of Section 2.2). In this section, we use these
criteria to discover possible (0 ;4) supersymmetric interactions between twisted hypers, standard
hypers and fermis.
As indicated in the Introduction (Section 1), interactions could be E-terms, gauge interactions, or
of the nonlinear sigma model type. Nonlinear sigma models have been discussed for O(1) standard
hypers in (0 ;4) projective superspace [HL17b] and arctic standard hypers in (4 ;4) projective super-
space [LR88]. We have not explored all the possibilities for E-term interactions. In this paper,
we consider the combination of F-arctic standard hypers, F-arctic fermis and O(1)0twisted hypers
with the R-charge assignments given previously (of course, everything we say can be used for the
mirror combination where we swap the two R-symmetry groups).
ConsiderF-arctic fermi multiplets  , arctic standard hypermultiplets ( ;  ) andO(1)0twisted
hypermultiplets Hwith the following projective constraints:
D+= 0;D+ = p
2bC;D+  =1p
2C ;D+H= 0;
D+= 0;D+ =p

23where D+=uava0Daa0+is the fully contracted derivative (see (2.29) in Section 2), C=va0Ca0and
bC=va0bCa0areO(1)0superelds which are functions of the various superelds in the model. The
second line in (5.1) is obtained by applying extended complex conjugation on the rst line and using
the appropriate denitions of extended complex conjugates from Section 2.6.
The closure of the supersymmetry algebra D2

D+C= 0;D+bC= 0;CbC= 0: (5.2)
The actionSfor the above superelds splits into an action SFinF-projective superspace for the
standard hypers and the fermis, and an action SF0inF0-projective superspace for the twisted hypers,

case whereCandbCare polynomials in the standard and twisted hypers. Recall that the F-weights
ofD+,, and  are +1, +1, 0 and  1 respectively. Since the F-weight has to be preserved
in the constraint equations (5.1) above, CandbCshould have F-weight 0. Further, since we restrict
CandCto be polynomials in the superelds, they must simply be independent of the standard
hypers .
The reality constraints (5.5) are also consistent with CandbCbeing independent of standard hypers.
However, note that CandbCcan be chosen to be more general F-weight 0 functions of the standard
hypers (e.g. rational functions) and these may have good Taylor expansions around both = 0 and
=1. Then it is possible to satisfy the reality constraint (5.5) even when CandbCdepend on
arctic standard hypers non-trivially.
24SinceCis anO(1)0supereld which is assumed to be a polynomial in the twisted hypers and is
annihilated by Da+, it must be linear in the O(1)0twisted hypers H. Thus,Cmust take the form

Recall from Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 4 that the dynamical components of the arctic standard hyper

6 Example: ADHM sigma model
In this section we consider an interacting model with standard hypers, fermis and twisted hypers.
This is a particular (0 ;4) linear sigma model which ows to a nonlinear sigma model with target
space ak-instanton solution in Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. This model was written in
(0;1) superspace in [Dou98, Wit95] and in harmonic superspace in [GS95, GS96].
This linear sigma model for U( n) instantons is realised by the following nested D-brane conguration
in Type IIB theory [Dou98]: 1 D1-brane kD5-branesnD9-branes. The kD5-branes appear
ask-instanton congurations in the D9-brane U( n) gauge theory and the D1-brane probes this
conguration. The 1 + 1 dimensional linear sigma model is the theory on the D1-brane worldsheet.
The D1-brane worldsheet theory includes a U(1) gauge multiplet arising from the D1-D1 open
string spectrum. However, the U(1) multiplet does not have an eect on the computation of the
instanton connection on target space in the classical theory on the D1-brane [Dou98]. We describe
the classical U( n) instanton model without the U(1) gauge multiplet in Section 6.1 and show that
it reproduces the calculation in [Dou98], and redo the analysis more carefully in the companion
paper [PR] with the gauge multiplet included. The novelty of the projective superspace approach
is that twistor space and the relevant holomorphic bundles on twistor space required for describing
instantons [War77, AW77, AHDM78] appear explicitly in the description of the model which we
describe below.
For SO(n) instantons, we add an O9 -plane to the above D-brane conguration. The orientifold
projection requires an even number of D5-branes which we take to be 2 k, and after the projection
pairs of D5-branes are stuck and cannot be separated. The projection reduces the D9-brane gauge
group to SO( n), that of the D5-branes to Sp( k) and projects out the vector multiplet on the D1-
brane. For Sp( n) instantons, we start with 2 nD9-branes, kD5-branes and 2 D1-branes and add
an O9+-plane which results in an Sp( n) gauge group on the D9-branes, an SO( k) gauge group on
the D5-branes and an Sp(1) gauge group on the D1-branes (again, the two D1-branes cannot be
25separated). These facts may be found in, e.g., [GP96]. Since the Sp( n) instanton sigma model
requires a gauge multiplet, and both SO( n) and Sp(n) models require orientifolds, we describe both
sigma models together in the companion paper [PR].
6.1 U(n) instantons
The supereld content consists of
1. 2k0twisted hypers HY0,Y0= 10;:::; 2k0(we consider 2 k0= 2 for most of the discussion),
2.kstandard hypers ( Y;Y  ),Y= 1;:::;k ,
3. 2k+nfermis A ,A= 1;:::; 2k+n.
The above superelds (for 2 k0= 2) are a subset of the low-energy spectrum of the various D p-Dq
open strings in the D-brane conguration described above. Since we are interested in the low-energy
theory on the D1-brane, we retain only those elds that appear from the D1-D popen string sectors
forp= 1;5;9. The two twisted hypers HY0arise from the D1-D1 strings in the directions transverse
to the D1-brane and D5-branes. The kstandard hypers Yarise from D1-D5 strings and the 2 k+n
fermis A arise from the D1-D5 strings (2 kfermis) and the D1-D9 strings ( nfermis). Part of the
couplingsCdescribed below arise from the D5-D9 open string degrees of freedom which are frozen
from the point of view of the D1-brane, and they contain the instanton moduli.
We suppress the avour indices Y0,YandAon the twisted hypers, standard hypers and fermis
respectively unless we wish to explicitly exhibit the avour properties of the superelds. We work
with a given symplectic structure !Y0Z0on the space of twisted hypers. This allows for a reality
condition:
HY0=!Y0Z0HZ0;i.e.,Ha0Y0="a0b0!Y0Z0Hb0Z0: (6.1)
(note that according to the above condition HY0= HY0since!Y0Z0!Z0X0= Y0
X0. This is
consistent with the result H= Hfor anO(1)0multiplet). The most general (0 ;4) constraints are
those given in (5.1):
D+= 0;D+ = p
2bC;D+  =1p
2C ;D+H= 0; (6.2)
where recall from Section 5 that C=va0Ca0,bC=va0bCa0areO(1)0superelds. As discussed in
Section 5,CandbCare independent of the standard hypers and are linear in the O(1)0twisted
hypersH. The constraints on the couplings CandbCthat follow from the closure of the (0 ;4)
superalgebra are (5.2) which we reproduce here for convenience:
D+C= 0;D+bC= 0;CbC= 0: (6.3)
CandbCand arek(2k+n) and (2k+n)kmatrices respectively; with the avour indices
explicitly displayed, the matrices are resp. written as CA
YandbCY
A. Recall from the discussion
around (5.7) that Chas to be of the form
C=K+LY0HY0; (6.4)
26whereHY0are the twisted hypermultiplets. The coupling Kis a constant k(2k+n) matrixO(1)0
supereld and the LY0are constant k(2k+n) matrices (one matrix for each Y02f1;:::; 2k0g).
Twistor space Let us consider two twisted hypers, i.e., 2 k0= 2 (everything we say for two
twisted hypers can be extended to general k0). The twisted hyper superelds Ha0Y0are coordinates
on the target space R4. The SU(2)0doubletva0together with the projective superelds HY0can
be interpreted as homogeneous coordinates Z= (v10;v20;H10;H20) for a CP3which is in fact the
twistor space of S4(the one-point compactication of the target R4). The symplectic structure
!Y0Z0on the space of twisted hypers and the symplectic structure "a0b0on the space of F0-doublets
together give an antiholomorphic involution va0!"a0b0vb0,HY0!!Y0Z0HZ0, on the CP3which
squares to 1. The (va0;HY0b0) serve as coordinates on the correspondence space and the incidence
relationsHY0=HY0a0va0are simply the denition of the HY0as projective superelds.
Monads on twistor space Next, we show that the couplings CandbCencode the data of a
monad onCP3. LetVSandbVSbe the vector spaces of and  respectively with dim VS=
dimbVS=kandVFbe the vector space of fermis with dim VF= 2k+n. Then, the couplings Cand
bCcan be interpreted as elements of Hom( VF;bVS) and Hom( VS;VF) respectively, as is clear from the
constraints (6.2). Recall that these maps are linear in the homogeneous coordinates Z=fva0;HY0g
sinceC=Ka0va0+LY0HY0. We thus have
VSbC !VFC !bVS: (6.5)
The constraint CbC= 0 that follows from the closure of the algebra (6.3) makes (6.5) a complex.
We further require that bCis injective and Cis surjective: this imposes non-degeneracy conditions
on the couplings Ka0andLY0. Then the above complex is precisely a monad and the cohomology
atVF, i.e., kerC=imbCis a holomorphic rank nvector bundleEonCP3which is trivial when
restricted to lines in CP3, and hasc2(E) =k. Thus, the data that goes into choosing the o-shell
supereld content of our linear sigma model is precisely the same data that goes into dening a
holomorphic bundle on twistor space CP3that is trivial on lines.
We get a symplectic structure on the bundle Ealso from the requirement that the action is (0 ;4)
supersymmetric. Some reality conditions (which were implicit in the previous sections) are necessary
on the vector spaces VF,VSandbVSto write down an action for the projective superelds  ,
and  . They are (1) a hermitian structure on VFthat identies V
F'V_
F, and (2) the
identication bV
S'V_
S, whereVandV_stand for the complex conjugate and dual of a vector
spaceVrespectively. With these at hand, the (0 ;4) invariance of the action gives the following
constraint (5.5) on the couplings CandbC:
C=bC; (6.6)
where the bar on Cacts the hermitian conjugate on the matrix components and extended conjugate
on theO(1)0supereld. This imposes a symplectic structure on the bundle Eobtained from the
monad (6.5). By the Penrose-Ward-Atiyah correspondence [War77, AW77], the bundle Eon twistor
27space with the symplectic structure described above corresponds to a self-dual SU( n) connection
onR4(more precisely, on the one-point compactication S4ofR4). The ADHM construction
[AHDM78] gives an explicit expression for the instanton gauge eld in terms of the data described
above. The constraints CC= 0 are precisely the ADHM equations that describe the instanton
moduli space [AHDM78].
Next, we show that the model ows to an SU( n) instanton solution in the infrared by explicitly
obtaining the expression for the instanton gauge eld given by the ADHM construction [AHDM78].
The material in the rest of this section is not new and follows the calculations in [Wit95, Dou98].
In Section 6.2 below, we choose particular bases for the vector spaces of superelds to give the
usual standard characterization of the ADHM instanton moduli space in terms of nite dimensional
matrices. Again, most of the material is standard except for a formula of the virtual dimension of
the instanton moduli space on R4k0fork02.
Instantons on R4The potential energy density of the model described above can be read o
from the general expression in (5.8) and is positive-denite:

Recall that Ca0=Ka0+LY0Ha0Y0and theaYare components of the arctic standard hyper Y=
1Y+2Yonce we eliminate the auxiliary superelds accompanying higher powers of (see (3.17)
and the discussion around it). Suppose the constant matrices Ka0andLY0are suciently generic
so that1
2Ca0Ca0f 1is an invertible kkmatrix, i.e., all its eigenvalues are non-zero, for any
value ofHa0Y0. Then, the vacuum corresponds to setting the aY= 0 for every avour Y= 1;:::;k .
About this vacuum, the potential Vvanishes and in particular does not give a mass for the twisted
hyper scalars: there is a classical moduli space of vacua R4parametrized by the four twisted
hyper scalars with the reality condition (6.1). Under the genericity assumption on Ka0andLY0, the
eigenvalues of the standard hyper mass matrix f 1are all (1) positive since f 1is a positive-denite
matrix, and (2) strictly positive since f 1is invertible. We list them as ( m2

We see that the massless fermis have now acquired an additional connection which is the pullback
of a connectionAon target space R4:
(AY0a0)ij:= i(Vy)iA@VAj
@HY0a0: (6.14)
This is the connection for a k-instanton solution with U( n) gauge group, a fact that follows from
standard results in the ADHM construction. Since we have assumed the instanton to be non-
degenerate, the U(1) part of the connection is trivial and AY0a0is in fact an SU( n) instanton
connection. We study the degenerate cases carefully in [PR] where we shall nd that the U(1)
gauge multiplet on the D1-brane worldsheet plays an important role.
6.2 The instanton moduli space and symmetries
The constraints CC= 0 and the fermi zero modes (6.11) (and in turn, the formula for the instanton
gauge eld) are unaected by GL( k;C) transformations on the space of standard hypermultiplets
and U(2k+n) transformations of the space of fermis:
C!SCUy; S2GL(k;C); U2U(2k+n): (6.15)
29Thus, two dierent solutions of CC= 0 that are related by a GL( k;C)U(2k+n) transformation
as in (6.15) correspond to the same instanton solution. This redundancy allows us to choose a
simple form for the coupling Cand the equations CC= 0.
Plugging in the explicit form C=K+LY0HY0, we get
0 =CC=KK+KLZ0HZ0+HY0LY0K+LY0LZ0HY0HZ0;
=KK+KLZ0!Z0X0HX0+HY0LY0K+LY0LZ0HY0!Z0X0HX0: (6.16)
We have used the reality condition (6.1) on the twisted hypers in going to the second line above.
Terms with dierent numbers of twisted hypers must vanish separately. Let us study each of them
in turn:
1. The constant part KKof (6.16) satises KK= 0. Displaying the SU(2)0indices explicitly,
we have
Kb0Kc0"c0a0+Ka0Kc0"c0b0= 0;i.e.,Kb0Kc0=b0c0; (6.17)
whereis a positive-denite kkmatrix.
2. The vanishing of the terms linear in HY0in (6.16) requires
KLZ0!Z0Y0+LY0K= 0;or, with SU(2)0indices,Kb0LZ0!Z0Y0= LY0Kc0"c0b0:(6.18)
3. The term quadratic in the twisted hypers LY0LZ0!Z0X0HY0HX0vanishes when
LY0LZ0!Z0X0+LX0LZ0!Z0Y0= 0;that isLY0LZ0!Z0X0=Y0X0; (6.19)
whereY0X0is antisymmetric in Y0X0and is an arbitrary hermitian kkmatrix for each
X0;Y02f1;:::; 2k0g. For the special case k0= 1, i.e., when there are two twisted hypers, the
antisymmetric matrix Y0X0is proportional to the symplectic form !Y0X0:
LY0LZ0!Z0X0= !Y0X0;that isLY0LZ0= Y0
Z0; (6.20)
whereis now a single positive-denite kkmatrix.
The couplings KandLY0transform under the GL( k;C)U(2k+n) (6.15) as
K!SKUy; LY0!SLY0Uy; (6.21)
with the same GL( k;C) matrixSand U(2k+n) matrixUfor allY0. This freedom can be used to
choose a convenient form for LY0andKas follows.
First, theLY0satisfy the constraints (6.19) LY0LZ0!Z0X0+LX0LZ0!Z0Y0= 0. Suppose we choose
the symplectic form canonically to be
!Y0Z0= diagk0=2f!2;!2;:::;! 2g;with!2= 
0 1
 1 0!
; (6.22)
30where diag`indicates that length of the diagonal matrix is `. Let us look at the pair of matrices
L10,L20. They satisfy
L10L10=L20L20=1020; L10L20= 0: (6.23)
By an appropriate GL( k;C) transformation S(6.21), we can transform 1020into thekkidentity
matrix. Then, the 2 k(2k+n) matrix 
L10

satises

L20!
L10L20
= 
1k0k
0k 1k!
; (6.24)
where 1kand 0kare thekkidentity and zero matrices respectively. Using an appropriate U(2 k+n)
transformation U(6.21), we can cast the above 2 k(2k+n) matrix into the form
 
L10
L20!
= 
1k0k0kn
0k 1k0kn!
: (6.25)
There is a residual U( k)U(n) subgroup of GL( k;C)U(2k+n) which preserves the above
conguration (6.25) which corresponds to
S=U; U =0

The reality constraint (6.18) for Y0= 10;20, i.e.,

is solved by the following expression for K:

LY0,Y0= 30;40;:::; 2k0can also be simplied to a form similar to (6.28) using the constraints
L10L2y0 1 L2y0L20= 0; L20L2y0 1+L2y0L10= 0; y0= 20;:::;k0; (6.29)
where we have introduced the index y0= 20;:::;k0, such that the pairs f2y0 1;2y0gcover the index
Y02f30;40;:::; 2k0g(later, we will append the value y0= 10as well). We then get the simplied

Therek0(2k2+ 2k2+ 2kn+ 2kn) =k0(4k2+ 4kn) real degrees of freedom.
31The remaining constraints on the Ka0andLY0,Y0= 30;40;:::, are
Ka0Kc0"c0b0+Ka0Kc0"c0b0= 0; Ka0LZ0!Z0Y0+LY0Kc0"c0a0= 0; LY0LZ0!Z0X0+LX0LZ0!Z0Y0= 0:
(6.32)
In terms of the matrices B(y0)
1,B(y0)
2,I(y0)andJ(y0),y0= 10;:::;k0, we have the equations
[B(y0)
1;B(z0)

2;B(z0)
2y] +I(y0)I(z0)y J(z0)yJ(y0)= 0;for ally0;z0= 10;:::;k0:(6.33)
Let us get a count of the number of such equations. The above equations are symmetric in y0,z0.
Fory0=z0, the last equation in (6.33) is manifestly real whereas the rst equation is complex. Thus,
fory0=z0, we havek03k2real equations. For y06=z0, it is sucient to restrict y0<z0, and both
equations in (6.33) are complex. This gives a count of1
2k0(k0 1)4k2. In total, the number of
equations is k2k0(2k0+ 1). Fork0= 1, the target space is R4and the above equations are precisely
the ADHM equations.
We must also remember that the instanton connection (6.14) is invariant under the residual U( k)
transformations (6.26). We treat the residual U( n) in (6.26) as a symmetry of framings at 1of the
instanton solution. The B(y0)
1,B(y0)
2are inert under framing whereas the I(y0)andJ(y0)transform
as
I(y0)!I(y0)eU; J(y0)!eUyJ(y0): (6.34)
Thus, the moduli space of framed instantons is described by

32A (0;1) and (0;2) superspace
A.1 (0;1) superspace
(0;1) superspace has coordinates ( x;+) where+is a real Grassmann variable. The correspond-
ing supercovariant derivatives are ( @;D+) which satisfy the algebra
D2
+= i@++: (A.1)
with all other commutators being zero.
Multiplets of the (0 ;1) supersymmetry algebra are not constrained. The most common ones are the
scalar multiplet (spin 0), the fermi multiplet (spin1
2, left-handed) and the gauge multiplet (spin 1).
The multiplets are irreducible representations of the algebra when they are real (or hermitian).
A real scalar supereld has components

wherejjjis a real scalar eld and +is a real right-handed fermion. We follow the usual convention

Since the superspace measure in the J-term involves only half the supercovariant derivatives, its
invariance under (0 ;2) supersymmetry requires the integrand to be chiral, i.e., D+(  J) = 0.
This implies
EJ:=X
EJ= 0: (A.15)
If the above constraint is not satised, supersymmetry is softly broken down from (0 ;2) to (0;1),
even though the J-term is written in (0 ;2) superspace.

B (4;4) projective superspace and (4 ;4)!(0;4)
B.1 Denitions
We start with the (4 ;4) real supercharges ( Qm+;Q~m ) withm, ~m= 1;2;3;4. The R-symmetry
group is
Spin(4)LSpin(4)R'SU(2)LSU(2)0
LSU(2)RSU(2)00
R:
We restrict our attention to the subgroup FF0F00whereF= SU(2) , the diagonal subgroup
of SU(2)LSU(2)R,F0= SU(2)0
LandF00= SU(2)00
R. The supercharges can then be written as
(Qaa0+;Qaa00 ) wherea,a0anda00are doublet indices of F,F0andF00respectively. This restriction
of the R-symmetry group to a subgroup seems to be required to obtain the vector multiplet via
gauged supercovariant derivatives and the relevant superspace constraints [Sie85].
The algebra of (4 ;4) supercovariant derivatives D aa0+and Daa00 is
fDaa0+;Dbb0+g= 2i"ab"a0b0@++;fDaa00 ;Dbb00 g= 2i"ab"a00b00@  ;fDaa0+;Dbb00 g= 0:
(B.1)
The reality conditions on the derivatives are
Daa0=Dbb0
"ba"b0a0: (B.2)
35It will be useful to dene the (2 ;2) subalgebra spanned by the derivatives
D+:= D 110+;D := D 1100 ;D+:= D 220+;D := D 2200 ; (B.3)
which satisfy
fD;Dg= 2i@: (B.4)
The non-manifest (4 ;4) supersymmetry generators are then Q +:= D 210+,Q+:= D120+and
Q := D 2100 ,Q := D1200 .
The general projective superspace corresponding to FF0F00is described by introducing a
doublet for each of the SU(2)s in the R-symmetry group: ua= (;1),va0= (0;1) andwa00= (00;1)
for the subgroups F= SU(2) ,F0= SU(2)0
LandF00= SU(2)0
Rrespectively.
We then dene the following projective supercovariant derivatives:
Da0+:=uaDaa0+;i.e., D10+=D++ Q +;D20+= Q++D+;
Da+:=va0Daa0+;i.e., D1+=0D+ Q+;D2+=0Q++D+;
Da00 :=uaDaa00 ;i.e., D100 =D + Q ;D200 = Q +D ;
Da :=wa00Daa00 ;i.e., D1 =00D  Q ;D2 =00Q +D : (B.5)
We also introduce the doublets eua,eva0andewa00as was done in the main text above eq. (2.9).
We again choose eua= (1;0),eva0= (1;0) andewa00= (1;0) and dene the linearly independent
derivatives:
eDa0+:=euaDaa0+;i.e.,eD10+= D +;eD20+= Q+;
eDa+:=eva0Daa0+;i.e.,eD1+= D +;eD2+= Q +;
eDa00 :=euaDaa00 ;i.e.,eD100 = D ;eD200 = Q ;
eDa :=ewa00Daa00 ;i.e.,eD1 = D ;eD2 = Q : (B.6)
We consider projective superelds which are functions of one projective coordinate from the left
moving sector ( or0) and one projective coordinate from the right-moving sector ( or00) and are
annihilated by the corresponding set of projective derivatives. For example, an ( F;F00) projective
supereld  is a function of and00and is annihilated by Da0+() and Da (00). The (4;4)
supersymmetric action is

36There are many choices for projective superelds: they can be a polynomial or a power series in
each of the projective coordinates that they depend on. A polynomial O(n) supereld with respect
toF,F0andF00will be respectively denoted as O(n),O(n0) andO(n00). Power series superelds
are typically denoted as F-arctic,F-antarctic, F0-arctic and so on. Below, we discuss the ( F;F)
arctic supereld, i.e., an arctic supereld which is a power series only in and is annihilated by
Da0+() and Da00 ().

Consider an ( F;F) arctic supereld () =P1

and  , 1  transform as weight  1 objects, along with an additional shift:

  (  1)!j(g;) 1(g) 1  ( (g) 1) + 1bi
2@  ( (g) 1): (B.19)
Using these, the (0 ;4) supersymmetric action (B.15) can be checked to be R-symmetric, a fact which
was already demonstrated for the (4 ;4) action (B.10).
The derivation of R-symmetry transformations
Note: In the following calculations, a0on superelds denotes the transformed supereld and must
not be confused with the0on the R-symmetry indices.
Given the transformation of in (B.16), the transformation of is
(  1)!0(  1) = (a+b 1) a 1+b
a+b 1
=1
(a b)a+b
a b a 1+b
a+b 1
;
(B.20)
which implies that
(  1)!0(  1) =j(g;) (g)( (g) 1): (B.21)
This tells us that transforms as a weight 1 eld as well.   transforms as
  ()
! 1
4
j(g;) 1eD100 (g) bD100 (g)
j(g;) 1eD200 (g)
j(g;)(g)
;
=j(g;) 1  (g) bi
2@  (g); (B.22)
that is,
  ()!0
  () =j(g;) 1  (g) bi
2@  (g): (B.23)
38Thus,   transforms as a weight  1 supereld but with an additional shift term proportional to
@  . Finally, we need the transformation of   . Analogous to (B.20), we have
0
  (  1) =1
a+b 1   a 1+b
a+b 1

which gives

2@  ( (g) 1): (B.25)
Again, we see that  1  transforms as a weight  1 supereld, along with an additional shift
term proportional to @  . We can also start with the denition of   in (B.14) and arrive at
the above result. In detail, we have
eD100 eD200 (  1)
!eD100 eD200 0(  1)

=j(g;) 1geD100 eD200 ( (g) 1) + 2ib g @  ( (g) 1): (B.26)
Also using the transformation of from (B.21), we get
eD100 eD200 0(  1) + 2i@  0(  1)
=j(g;) 1geD100 eD200 ( (g) 1) + 2i

 j(g;) 1
@  ( (g) 1):
(B.27)
The quantity in the parentheses in the last line simplies to give b=. Plugging this into (B.27) and
dividing by 4, we get (B.25).
The fermis a00 transform as weight 0 objects:
a00 ()!
j(g;) 1eDa00 (g) bDa00 (g)
j(g;)(g)
=eDa00 (g)(g) =a00 (g):(B.28)
The conjugates a00
 also transform with weight 0, a fact which can be seen either by complex
conjugating the expressions in (B.28) or by direct calculation using the expression for a00
 in (B.14):
eDa00 (  1)!eDa00 0(  1) =

which gives
a00
 (  1)!a00
 ( (g) 1): (B.30)
39C Component actions
In this appendix, we derive the action for the ordinary space components of the various superelds
in two ways: (1) by reducing to (0 ;2) superspace and using standard results from Appendix A.2,
and (2) by reducing directly to ordinary space by pushing in the eDa0+in the superspace measure.
C.1 (0;4)!(0;2)!(0;0)
Recall from Sections 3 and 4 the and0expansions of the various superelds:
=1X
j=0j;  =1X
j=0j  ; =1X
j=0j ;H=0H10+H20: (C.1)
Also recall that we relabelled some low-lying components of the above superelds since they were
constrained as (0 ;2) superelds:
0!2;  1!1;and0 !  : (C.2)
We reproduce here the projective superspace constraints on the various superelds given in (5.1):
D+= 0;D+ = p
2bC;D+  =1p
2C ;D+H= 0;
D+= 0;D+ =p
2bC;D+  =1p
2 C;D+H= 0; (C.3)
The actions are given by
SF=Z

; (C.4)
The closure of the projective superspace algebra D2
+= 0 on   gives the constraints
D+C=D+bC= 0;CbC= 0;i.e., Da+C=Da+bC= 0; C (a0bCb0)= 0; (C.5)
and the (0;4) invariance of the above actions gives
C=bC;that is;bCa0=Cb0"b0a0: (C.6)
The assumption that the Care polynomials in the various superelds constrains Cto take the
formC=K+LH. The constraints (C.3) lead to the following E-terms for the (0 ;2) supereld
  =0 and0  :
D+  = p
2E= p
2bC202;D+0  =1p
2C20  : (C.7)
Integrating out the auxiliary supereld   proceeds in the same way as in the free case, with one
important dierence due to the E-term for0  above. Unconstraining 0  in the standard way
(see Footnote 5), we get
 D+D+(10  +  (D+0   1p
2C20  )): (C.8)
40Integrating out 0  gives1= D+ which implies that 1is a (0;2) chiral supereld which
we labelled as 1. In addition, there is now a (0 ;2)J-term:
 1p
2D+D+(  C20  ) = 1p
2D+(1C20   p
2 C20bC202) = 1p
2D+(1C20  );(C.9)
where, in the last equality, we have used the constraint C20bC20= 0 that follows from (C.5).
Rewriting the projective superspace measure in (C.4) as   1D+D+and performing the - and
0-integrals, we get the following (0 ;2) superspace actions:
SF0=Z
d2xD+D+
i
2H10@  H10 i
2H20@  H20

SF=Z

+Z
d2xD+( 1p
21C20  ) + c.c.;(C.10)
with D+  =p
2E= p
2bC202.
Now we further push in the derivatives in the (0 ;2) actions above and compute the component
actions according to Appendix A.2. Recall that the superspace components of Ha0are
p
21+= D +H20;p
21
+= D+H20;p
22+= D+H10;p
22

and the superspace components of aare
p
210+= D +2;p
210
+= D+2; p
220+=D+1;p
220

The components of the fermi   are
D+  = p
2G ; D+  = p
2G : (C.13)
Let us work out the twisted hyper part of SF0rst. We have

Let us look at the potential terms:
 V= 1C20C201 2bC20bC202= 1C20C201 2C10C102; (C.19)
where, in the second step, we have used the reality constraint (C.6). The above form does not seem
invariant under R-symmetry. However, it follows from CC= 0 thatC10C10=C20C20which allows
us to write the potential in manifest R-symmetry form:
 V= 1
2aCa0Ca0a: (C.20)
Next, let us collect all the Yukawa couplings from the fermi action (C.18):


+C10   20C20   1p

We haveCa0=Ka0+LHa0. Then, we get

+(K10+LH10)   20(K20+LH20)   1L1+  
+ c.c. (C.22)
We thus get the manifest R-symmetric form of the Yukawa couplings

 a0
+Ka0   aLa+   a0
+LHa0  
+ c.c.; (C.23)
where the rst term and its complex conjugate together are mass terms which contain the fermis
and the superpartners of the standard hypers. The other terms are Yukawa couplings which involve
the standard hypers, the twisted hypers and the fermis.
C.2 (0;4)!(0;0)
In this subsection, we directly go from (0 ;4) superspace to ordinary space. We give two illustrative
examples, anO(1) standard hyper and an arctic fermi.
O(1) standard hyper Recall from (3.3) and (3.5) that the (0 ;4) descendants of are, at the
