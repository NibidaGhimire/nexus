We constructadipole-facilitated kineticconstraint topa rtition theHilbertspace intothreediscon-
nected subspaces, two of which are nonthermal and the other a cts as an intrinsic thermal bath. The
resulting glassy system freely oscillates in nonthermal su bspaces, making the quantum entanglement
perform like a substantial qubit. The spatially spreading e ntanglement, quantiﬁed by concurrence,
ﬁdelity and 2-R´ enyi entropy, is found to be spontaneously r ecovered which is absent in other refer-
ence models. Under low-frequency random ﬂip noise, this rev ersible hydrodynamics of entanglement
holds high ﬁdelity and volume law, while at high frequency th ermalization unusually occurs leading
to a strange phase transition. Our work oﬀers an elaborate sp ace structure for realizing ergodicity
breaking and controllable entanglement dynamics.
In traditional thermodynamic perspective, the entropy simply incr eases when more states in the Hilbert space are
populated. Recent progresses in random quantum circuits howeve r indicate the measurement can induce breakdown
of entropic volume law, as a unitary makes the spreading entangleme nt entropy increase by one in each step, implying
its particle nature [1, 2]. It is then pretty interesting whether the e ntanglement can be manipulated as a substantial
particle, but just like in superconducing circuits [3, 4], the uniform lev els of particle hinder eﬃcient quantum control
and it has to be reduced to two-level system enabled by speciﬁc anh armonicity. Subsequently, it serves as the main
object of the present work to introduce well-designed kinetic cons traints to disconnect the subspaces to which the
entanglement may spread.
In glassy systems, kinetic constraints give rise to weak ergodic bre aking in presence of the fragmentation of Hilbert
space with outlying nonthermal states [5–7]. For example, in a triang ular antiferromagnetic lattice, the dynamics
of a local spin is frustrated due to the constraint from neighboring spins [8, 9]. In the spin glass phase, therefore,
long-range orders are absent and the featured timescale of ther malization becomes ultraslow. This interesting local
dynamics is then described by kinetically constrained models (KCMs), such as the Fredrickson-Andersen (FA) model
and the Eastmodel [10–12]. Basedonthe disorder-freequantumE astmodel, it hasbeen proventhat alargenumberof
nonthermal states can be constructed to manifest area-lawent anglement entropy [13, 14]. In this Letter, we introduce
a newdipole-facilitated kinetic constraint, whichresults in unusuale rgodicitybreakingbytwodisconnected subspaces.
Initially from the Bell state and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ( GHZ) state, we will study the exotic dynamics of
entanglement within this elaborately constructed block structure of Hilbert space.
Our basic idea is to constrain the spin ﬂip by some speciﬁc neighboring s tate, which is motivated by the CNOT
gate in quantum computation with the control circuit being instead c omposed of two spins or a dipole. We start from
cutting a triangular spin lattice into a quasi-one-dimensional chain as sketched in Fig. 1(a) [15, 16]. Odd and even
sites are separated into lower and upper sides labeled by diﬀerent co lors. The constraint rule is described as follows.
First, two neighboring spins favor antiparallel conﬁguration due to antiferromagnetic interaction. Second, a third spin
in the triangle formed with these two spins is allowed to ﬂip only if its neigh boring spin is in down state. Of course
we can parallel consider the constraint from up state but that is su rely equivalent. Subsequently, this newly-proposed
KCM can be named as dipole-facilitated model (DFM). The model Hamilt onian is written as

respectively. Throughout this work, the periodic boundary condit ion (PBC) is adopted for this model.

state of atom can be mapped as spin up and down. Under some contr ollable experimental conditions, the nearest-
neighbour Rydberg blockade eﬀect can be well described by the so- called PXP model [20, 21], which has got very
similar constraint with the present DFM. In this context, we think th at the DFM should not be diﬃcult to be realized
in a Rydberg atom array.
Let us ﬁrst discuss the Hilbert space of DFM in block representation [22]. We consider four sites as instance. Two
successivesites aregrouped into one “group-site”, and we denot e (↓↓), (↑↓), (↓↑) and (↑↑) as◦,⊲,⊳and•, respectively.
Under the action of Hdf, we notice that these conﬁgurations ( ◦◦), (⊳⊲), (⊳•), (•⊲) and (••) are annihilated and the
rest can be categorized into three subspaces. The transformat ion rules are
T :◦•←→⊲•←→⊲⊳←→•⊳←→•◦,
L :◦⊲←→⊲⊲←→⊲◦,R :◦⊳←→⊳⊳←→⊳◦.(2)
These three reaction paths can be straightforwardly extended t o any longer chains and subsequently construct a large
thermal subspace labeled by T and two nonthermal subspaces labe led by L (all even sites are spin-down) and R (all
odd sites are spin-down), as sketched in Fig.1(b).
Mostinterestingly,thesethreedisconnectedsubspacestotallyd ecidetheactivespatialstateofsystems. Forexample,
if the initial state of a system without perturbation is |↑↓...↑↓/an}bracketri}ht, even sites will persistently stay in spin-down state,
implying that the time evolution of the system is conﬁned to the subsp ace L. The reverse holds true as well, namely
states initiated from |↓↑...↓↑/an}bracketri}htstays in the R subspace. Now, if we have an initial state |0/an}bracketri}ht=|↓↓...↓↓/an}bracketri}ht, it will
evolve into completely diﬀerent subspace and stay there depending on how we add spin-up into the lattice. Adding
a single spin-up to even (odd) site activates R (L) subspace, respe ctively, and two successive spin-up’s break the
conﬁnement of above two nonthermal subspaces leading to the T s ubspace which may act as an intrinsic thermal bath
as discussed below.
One may ask if these disconnected subspaces possess similar featu re with that in the Hilbert space fragmentation.
Breaking the Hilbert space into disconnected sectors is the nontriv ial feature of generic KCM, but in most cases the
number of Krylov subspaces is exponentially dependent of the syst em size [19]. In our DFM the number of subspaces
is ﬁxed no matter how large the system is, which is as stated essentia l to produce nontrivial entanglement dynamics.
In the following, we use time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) to comp ute the dynamics on the chain [23, 24].
We ﬁrst show the time evolution of expectation value of z-Pauli oper ator/an}bracketle{tZi/an}bracketri}htwith diﬀerent initial states for L= 24.
Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the results from the initial states |↓↑...↓↑/an}bracketri}htand|↓...↓↑↓...↓/an}bracketri}ht, respectively. In two cases,
the spins are continuously ﬂipped on the even sites, but all odd sites keep spin-down without any ﬂipping. That is,
the system freely oscillates in the R subspace resulting from ergodic ity breaking. The parallel case in L subspace is
not shown. For a comparison, we calculate the initial state with two s uccessive spin-up sites in the middle of the3

FIG. 2: Time evolution of /angbracketleftZi/angbracketrighton a 24-site lattice. (a) The initial state is | ↓↑...↓↑/angbracketright. The odd sites keep in spin-down and
even sites behave periodic oscillation. (b) The initial sta te is| ↓...↓↑↓...↓/angbracketright, i.e. a single spin-up is located at i= 12, which
spreads to the ends of the chain but odd sites keep in spin-dow n persistently. (c) The initial state is | ↓...↓↑↑↓...↓/angbracketright, i.e. the

becomes ergodic, as all sites are being ﬂipped in the time evolution.
Let us now categorize all sites into two for convenience with regard to quantum computations. The sites always
being spin-downin aproductstate arecalledidle sitesandthe others asworksites. Aslongasthe systemissuﬃciently
large, the probability that all work sites simultaneously ﬂip to spin-do wn is extremely low. Therefore, we can denote
idle sites to be 0, work sites together as 1, to form a large and subst antial logical qubit. In superconducting circuits,
quantum non-demolition parity measurements can be realized by ass igning some qubits as control nodes to detect
errors of adjacent data qubits [25]. Analogously, herein, if we intro duce a spin-up at a left end work site, the right end
work site will tell us the initial odevity, and errors caused by noise ca n be detected by the appearance of successive
spin-up’s. A single logical qubit can thus be in a superposition state of product states in the L and R subspace,
labeled by|L/an}bracketri}htor|R/an}bracketri}htrespectively, paving a novel way for fault tolerance with this “big” q ubit.

FIG. 3: Concurrence between middle two sites ( i= 4 and 5) in 8-site systems. All initial states are set as the B ell state.
(a) Time evolution with DFM shows recoverable periodic osci llations. (b) Adding a random ﬂip noise with TX= 1, the
bipartite entanglement gradually decreases during oscill ation. This calculation result is averaged over 1000 sample s for random
Xoperators. Results of time evolution without noise under (c ) the East model at Rokhsar-Kivelson point, (d) the PXP model
from Rydberg blockade and (e) the antiferromagnetic Heisen berg model do not show periodic behavior. The East model is in
open boundary condition and others are in PBC.
Essentially, this logical qubit can be promisingly applied to various enta ngled states. By a two-qubit gate, it is easy
to obtain a local Bell state in many-body system ( L= 8), i.e.,|Bell/an}bracketri}ht=1√
2(|↓↓↓↓↑↓↓↓/an}bracketri}ht +|↓↓↓↑↓↓↓↓/an}bracketri}ht ), which will
generally be evolving into |L/an}bracketri}ht+|R/an}bracketri}ht. Then, we focus on the entanglement between middle two sites to se e the inﬂuence
of the disconnected subspaces. To this end, we calculate the conc urrence to quantize the bipartite entanglement
between them [26, 27], which is deﬁned as
C(ρ) = max{λ1−λ2−λ3−λ4,0}, (3)4
whereλk’s arethe eigenvaluesindescendingorderofthe Hermitian matrix r=/radicalbig√ρ˜ρ√ρand ˜ρ= (σy⊗σy)ρ∗(σy⊗σy).
σyandρare y-Pauli matrix and reduced density matrix of the two middle sites by partially tracing others [28].
As displayed in Fig. 3(a), we observe a surprising periodicity of the en tanglement, especially its maximum, which is
very like a Newton’s cradle. This novel nonthermal dynamic behavior stems from that two superposed bases of |Bell/an}bracketri}ht
are restricted in two disconnected nontrivial subspaces, and the time evolution in these two subspaces are completely
symmetric allowing the entanglement to be spontaneously recovere d after spreading. To be comparisons, three other
typical models of spin chain are also calculated, namely the East mode l, the PXP model and the antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model as shown in Fig. 3(c), (d) and (e). There are no c onserved quantities in the PXP model which
was ﬁrst introduced in the quantum many-body scars and also in the classical East model for describing spin glasses
[14]. The Heisenberg model merely conserves the total spin. Remar kably, concurrences in these three models do not
perform any visible cradle-like periodicity but just irregular oscillation s.
To see how the nonthermal dynamics is broken down, we then mimic th e inevitable noise which can be described as
(oﬀ-diagonal) bit ﬂip and the (diagonal) projection, respectively. I n the ﬁrst case if an idle site is ﬂipped from spin-
down to spin-up by oﬀ-diagonal noise, one of subspaces L or R will be transferred into T. As a result, the entangled
state is destroyed irreversibly by the T thermal bath. We then add a random measurement into the Hamiltonian as
a noisy source, following the form:
HX(t) =Hdf+/summationdisplay
nXjδ(t−nTX) (4)
wherejis a random site to be measured and the noisy term occurs every t=nTX. In Fig. 3(b), we observe that
although the concurrence still oscillates, the envelope decays gra dually under the noise TX= 1 and will not recover,
manifestingtheirreversiblebreakingofperiodicity. Itimpliesthemea surementhasinducedatransitionofthedynamic
feature. In the case of diagonal noise, we can also set a noisy Hamilt onian similar to Eq. (4) with projectors Qior
Pi. Compared with the oﬀ-diagonal noise which connects subspaces, these diagonal projectors do not hybridize the
subspaces unless all work sites are simultaneously set to be 0 which is almost impossible, so their inﬂuence is much
easier to be eliminated and is not considered here.

FIG. 4: Fidelity and reduced 2-R´ enyi entropy evolving with HX. (a) The ﬁdelity F=|/angbracketleftGHZ|φ(t)/angbracketright|withTX= 0.5 (red),TX= 1
(blue),TX= 2 (orange), TX= 4 (green), TX= 8 (cyan) and TX=∞(black) is obtained after quench from 8-site |GHZ/angbracketright. The
system behaves high-frequency oscillations and the envelo pe lines of higher bound are bolded. The TX=∞case is equal to
evolving under Hdf, which shows periodicity without decay. (b) The reduced 2-R ´ enyi entropy S(ρ) of even sites for diﬀerent
TX. AtTX=∞, the entropy is constant over time. Dashed lines indicate th e linear dependency of entropy and time, namely
the volume law. Above calculation results are all averaged o ver 500 runs for Xoperators on random sites.
In order to further comprehend the measurement-induced phas e transition in DFM, we move on to consider the5
8-site GHZ state |GHZ/an}bracketri}ht=1√
2(|↑↓↑↓↑↓↑↓/an}bracketri}ht +|↓↑↓↑↓↑↓↑/an}bracketri}ht ) as the initial state which also belongs to |L/an}bracketri}ht+|R/an}bracketri}htand
has many-body entangled properties distinguished from the Bell st ate. We calculate the ﬁdelity F=|/an}bracketle{tGHZ|φ(t)/an}bracketri}ht|
between evolving and GHZ state to characterize the inﬂuence of wr ong actions under noise, which actually quantiﬁes
the ﬂuctuation of initial state. As shown in Fig. 4(a), for the syste m without random actions, the ﬁdelity is able to
come back to 1 periodically, implying perfect many-body revivals. By a dding a noisy term, the ﬁdelity is gradually
decreasing over time, i.e. the distance between evolving state and |GHZ/an}bracketri}htis increasing. If setting the time axis in the
unit of nanosecond as for usual case, it is estimated that even in a v ery noisy environment with frequency being about
125 MHz, the ﬁdelity of |GHZ/an}bracketri}htcan keep above 0 .8 after 400 ns, suggesting a fairly good robustness [29].
We can also calculate the entanglement entropy between even and o dd sites. The reduced 2-R´ enyi entropy with a
normalized logarithmic base for the reduced density matrix ρof even sites is then deﬁned as
S(ρ) =−log16Tr(ρ2), (5)
whichalsocharacterizesthelocalizationofwavefunction[30]. Asde picted inFig.4(b), withoutnoisetheentanglement
remains a ﬁxed value Smin= log162 = 0.25, with respect to two nonzero diagonal elements in the reduced d ensity
matrix. In other cases, the R´ enyi entropy keeps growing befor e saturated. There is a signiﬁcant phase transition:
ForTX>1 the entropy is in the early stage linearly dependent of time suggest ing the system stays in an entangling
phase with volume law, and for TX<1 the entropy rapidly saturates indicating the measurement induce s an area-law
disentangling phase and thermalization takes place instead of localiza tion in common cases. More interestingly, the
area-law entropy is even larger than the volume-law entropy. In th e small nonthermal subspaces the entanglement is
periodic and localized so the increase is extremely slow, while when the lo calization is broken down, a large number
of states will instantly evolve into large thermal T subspace to make the entropy rapidly increase, which is very
similar with the entanglement tsunami [31]. Consequently, the T sub space itself performs an intrinsic thermal bath
for nonthermal subspaces which is the most appealing structure o f DFM.
Before ending, we make a simple analogy between our model and the d isorder-free localization model which is
composed of spinless fermions and spin-1/2 on the bond [32]. As a fer mionic matter ﬁeld, the fermion tunneling is
related to coupled spins. We take one triangle on the lattice as instan ce. It is easy to derive that
H2
df= [Q1P2(σ+
3+σ−
3)+(σ+
1+σ−
1)P2Q3]2
=Q1P2+P2Q3+σ−
1P2σ+
3+σ+
1P2σ−
3,(6)
whereσ+
i=|↑/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{t↓|andσ−
i=|↓/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{t↑|are spin upper and lower operators. One can see that, the last two terms are
nothing but the constrained hopping term in the disorder-free loca lization model, namely the hopping is determined
by spin on bond. As a result, our model Hdfjust decomposes the localization into two subspaces and thus enab les
the nonthermal entanglement.
In summary, originated from triangular frustrated kinetic constr aints, the DFM manifests exotic disconnected
subspace structure. The entanglement exhibits appealing nonthe rmal periodic dynamics acting as a substantial qubit.
Under low-frequency ﬂip noise, the entanglement ballistically increas es while at high frequency it saturates in an
instant, indicating a phase transition to thermalization takes place s temming from the intrinsic thermal subspace.
