We show the laser-driven acceleration of unprecedented, collimated (2 mrad divergence), and quasi-monoenergetic
(25 % energy spread) electron beams with energy up to 50 MeV at 1 kHz repetition rate. The laser driver is a multi-
cycle (15 fs) 1 kHz optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA) system, operating at 26 mJ (1 .7 TW). The
scalability of the driver laser technology and the electron beams reported in this work pave the way towards developing
high-brilliance x-ray sources for medical imaging, innovative devices for brain cancer treatment, and represent a step
towards the realization of a kHz GeV electron beamline.
Electron accelerators are a cornerstone technology of mod-
ern society. In their variations they are daily used as strate-
gic tools at the disposal of the healthcare system for medi-
cal imaging and cancer treatment. As an example, medical
linear accelerators already use electron beams with energies
up to 20 MeV for cancer radiotherapy1. Radio-frequency
acceleration is the backbone of the technology driving these
machines and it is nowadays, after its first demonstration in
19282, generally acknowledged as an extremely reliable tech-
nology. Radio-frequency acceleration technology has never-
theless a fundamental limitation that is to be found in their
maximum achievable accelerating gradient ( ≈100 MV /m).
As of today, various proven technologies with the poten-
tial to overcome these limitations (by withstanding acceler-
ating gradients exceeding 100 MV /mm and drastically re-
ducing the accelerator footprint) exist, such as laser-driven
wakefield acceleration (LWFA)3,4, particle-driven (or plasma)
wakefield acceleration (PWFA)5,6, structure-based wakefield
acceleration7,8, or a combination of those9,10. In recent years,
the huge wakefield acceleration potential motivated an exten-
sive effort by numerous groups worldwide, leading to remark-
able achievements, ranging from the demonstration of the first
GeV laser-driven electron beams11–13to the acceleration of
multi-GeV electrons via plasma guiding14,15and the demon-
stration of free electron lasing16.
The desire to translate these exceptional results into work-
ing machines resulted in the demonstration of stable electron
beam operation over more than 24 hours17and the accelera-
tion of quasi-monoenergetic electron beams at 1 kHz repeti-
tion rate18,19. With the typical charge per pulse of the order
of pC20–23, the resulting average current of a kHz LWFA is of
the order of nA, which (provided the electron beam energy
is>40 MeV) would be enough to enable several medical
applications24,25. These groundbreaking achievements were
obtained by exploiting nonlinearities through gas-filled hol-
low core fiber compression down to single-cycle laser pulsesin order to reach the relativistic intensity on target required
to drive the wake wave in the plasma, where the injected
electrons can be accelerated up to 15 MeV19. Despite pro-
ducing very stable electron beams, this technique is limited
both by the maximum laser power available and by the max-
imum coupling efficiency into the hollow core fiber, setting a
limit to the maximum electron energy attainable. Moreover,
LWFA driven by single-cycle lasers is also sensitive to carrier-
envelope phase effects26,27, posing an additional limit on the
achievable electron beam energy and quality.
In this letter we show, for the first time, the production
of quasi-monoenergetic (25 % energy spread), collimated
(2 mrad divergence) electron beams with energy up to E≈
50 MeV with multi-cycle (15 fs) laser pulses at 1 kHz repe-
tition rate, overcoming the requirement of single-cycle com-
pression and proving the energy scalability of the technology.
This breakthrough was achieved by ELI Beamlines’ in-house
development of the L1-Allegra multi-TW 1 kHz laser28, based
on the OPCPA technology.
Some first demonstrations of relativistic electrons acceler-
ated with short-pulsed OPCPA systems29,30showed the po-
tential of this laser technology, even if at a much lower repe-
tition rate of 10 Hz. The L1-Allegra laser’s key features for
LWFA are its multi-stage power scalable design (final output
expected >100 mJ), the inherently excellent nanosecond con-
trast being pumped by 3 ps Yb:YAG thin-disk lasers, and its
power and pointing stability (few % level) over many hours
of continuous operation. Having a high contrast prevents un-
wanted detrimental effects due to pre-pulse induced plasma
profile modifications.
The L1-Allegra laser was running six amplification stages
[as shown in Fig. 1(a)] achieving a pulse energy of 26 mJ,
measured inside the interaction chamber. Optimal compres-
sion of the output pulses was achieved through a combination
of chirped mirrors and initial stretching by a programmable
acousto-optic modulator (Dazzler). Ahead of the interactionarXiv:2302.11415v2  [physics.plasm-ph]  29 May 20242

chamber, the laser pulses were characterized by measuring
the near-field profile [Fig. 1(b)] (where the elliptical profile
is mainly due to the use of spherical mirrors in the laser tele-
scopes and to the little amount of residual spatial chirp from
the amplifiers), the time duration [Fig. 1(c)] and the spectrum
[Fig. 1(d)]. These were performed by a second harmonic gen-
eration frequency-resolved optical gating (SHG FROG) de-
vice, resulting in a pulse duration of 15 fs FWHM (with the
transform-limited duration being 14 .7 fs) and a central wave-
length λ0=820 nm.
The laser pulses were focused by a 76 .2 mm focal length
off-axis parabola (nominal f/1) down to a measured focal
spot [Fig. 1(e)] with FHWM of 4 .2 and 3 .1µm along the
horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. This corresponds
to an effective beam waist 3 .1±0.3µm and to a Rayleigh
range≈37µm. The resulting peak intensity in the focus was
I0≈4.8×1018W/cm2(corresponding to a normalized vector
potential a0≈1.5). Considering the optimal electron density
for this work of ne≈5.7×1019cm−3(which corresponds
to a fraction of the critical plasma density ne/nc≈0.034),
the available laser power was well above the self-focusing
threshold ≈0.52 TW. This allows for self-guiding4inside
the plasma, as is visible in the Thomson scattering diagnostic
[Fig. 1(f)].
The pulses were focused in the first half of the in-house de-
signed and characterized31,32300µm diameter flat-top gas jet,
150µm above the nozzle exhaust [Fig. 1(g) and (f)]. The gastarget position was optimized in three dimensions with accu-
racy at the level of the plasma wavelength λp≈4.5µm, lead-
ing to an optimal focusing position inside the plasma profile.
The repeatability and stability of the acceleration process was
assured by the laser contrast higher than 1010at the ps-level
(measured by the Sequoia cross-correlator), below detection
limit beyond several ps from the main pulse, as well as by the
laser pointing stability on target of 3 .6±0.3µrad (averaged
root-mean-square).
The accelerated electron beams were characterized by a cal-
ibrated electron spectrometer [Fig. 1(h)] consisting of a mo-
torized 5 mm collimator aluminum slit, a motorized 39 mm
long 0 .1 T permanent magnetic dipole, and a LANEX Fast
Back scintillator screen captured by using a 12-bit CMOS
global shutter camera [Fig. 1(i)]. The electron beam spec-
tra were retrieved by simulating the particle tracking in the
measured three-dimensional (3D) field. The measured beam
energy is conservative, being the deflection measured from the
furthermost slit edge.
The limited energy available out of kHz laser systems usu-
ally requires to operate targets at relatively high plasma den-
sities in order to enable relativistic self-focusing19. This in
turn shortens λpto a few microns and ultimately results in the
need of a comparable resolution in the laser-plasma interac-
tion diagnostics33. The laser-plasma interaction was first opti-
mized at a reduced laser power of 0 .8 TW, by carefully tuning
the focus position inside the gas target profile monitored with3
a 5×magnification optical side-view and a 2 ×achromatic
Thomson scattering spectrally filtered (550 nm longpass) top-
view diagnostics, both with a resolution smaller than λp. The
gas pressure was then tuned by an electronic valve in order to
achieve simultaneously relativistic self-focusing and electron
injection in the plasma wave.
The laser pulses were delivered on target at 1 kHz repeti-
tion rate for the whole duration of the experiment, in order to
reach thermal equilibrium in all the components of the system.
The gas jet opening time (synchronized with the arrival of the
driving pulse by a trigger) was set, depending on the regime
of operation, as either pulsed or continuous. In fact, it must
be noted that the radiation level achieved by a kHz LWFA ma-
chine is well above the typical values for laser facilities. The
possibility of running continuous gas flow was enabled by a
double differential pumping system, on target and before the
compressor, which kept the laser-driven acceleration process
unaffected throughout several hours of continuous operation.
Typical density profiles for the specific gas jet, along with the
relevant gas types and backing pressures used, were computed
using ANSYS Fluent software and are depicted in Fig. 1(j).
After obtaining quasi-monoenergetic beams with 0 .8 TW,
we gradually ramped the laser energy up to 26 mJ (1 .7 TW),
iteratively optimizing the gas density and the focusing posi-
tion inside the target density profile. In addition, the sec-
ond order spectral phase was optimized using an acousto-optic
programmable dispersive filter [Dazzler in Fig. 1(a)] to com-
pensate for the plasma medium dispersion and to extend the
acceleration.
The most energetic and collimated electron beams were ob-
tained by firing the laser on a gas mixture of helium (98 %)
and nitrogen (2 %), which allowed acceleration at an electron
density at the target profile plateau as low as ne/nc≈0.034.
In this configuration, record-high energy (up to 50 MeV) elec-
tron beams were obtained [Fig. 2(a)]. By averaging over
thousands of laser shots, we observed the high-energy quasi-
monoenergetic distribution to have an average peak of 32 ±
5 MeV, with an average energy spread of ≈8 MeV (25 %)
FWHM and a beam divergence of 2 .1±0.8 mrad FWHM.
The experimental measurements are in agreement with the-
oretically estimated values. Considering the “best” focusing
scenario, where all the available laser energy is concentrated
within the focal spot, the anticipated maximum electron en-
ergy is ≈55 MeV. However, taking into account the “aver-
age” experimental focusing performance [Fig. 1(e)], the max-
imum energy drops to ≈33 MeV.
We observed that small changes in certain laser and plasma
parameters can significantly alter the LWFA process away
from its optimal configuration. For example, a change in
the plasma density from ne/nc≈0.034 to ≈0.038 (13 %)
results in a significant reduction of the beam energy and in
the loss of the quasi-monoenergetic feature [shown as exam-
ple in Fig. 2(b)]. This transition is readily discernible from
the average one-dimensional (1D) electron spectra depicted
in Fig. 2(c) for both density profiles.
We investigated the electron acceleration for the “aver-
age” experimental laser and plasma parameters also with 3D
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations using the EPOCH34code.

The simulations which used the mixture of a neutral gas ob-
tained from a hydrodynamic simulation of the gas jet and
incorporated the effect of field ionization shown a negligi-
ble contribution from the electrons injected via the ionization
mechanism. Therefore, the laser pulse was set to propagate
in a cold and collisionless plasma consisting of 5 ×ionized
nitrogen and fully ionized helium [Fig. 1(j)]. The simula-
tions were evolved over the time interval of 2 .2 ps and uti-
lized the technique of moving window with dimensions of
70λ0×80λ0×100λ0. The underlying Cartesian grid was uni-
form with the resolution of 30 and 15 cells per λ0along the
laser propagation direction and the transverse directions, re-
spectively.
In the ne/nc=0.034 case, the laser pulse self-focuses in
the plasma and its peak amplitude attains a value ≈1.7×
higher than a0. The electron self-injection occurs in the fo-
cus at several periods of the wake wave except the first one
[Fig. 3(a)]. A second self-injection occurs when the laser en-
ters the region of the electron density down-ramp, correspond-
ing to the mechanism described in Ref. 35. Consequently,
two distinct electron populations can be observed in the en-
ergy spectrum [Fig. 3(b)]. The electrons with energies in the
ranges ≈5−15 and ≈20−30 MeV originate from the sec-
ond and first injection processes, respectively. The electrons
originating from the first injection process begin to dephase
after≈48µm of propagation within the accelerating phase4

of the wakefield. The wakefield structure, however, starts to
slip back (with respect to the electron beam motion) due to
the nonlinear evolution of the driving laser pulse such that the
electrons can traverse into the accelerating phase of the pre-
ceding wakefield period. Herein, they undergo an additional
energy boost, resulting in an increase of ≈5 MeV compared
to their energy after the initial acceleration phase. At the end
of the simulation, the energy spectra of both electron beams
are quasi-monoenergetic. The cut-off energies of the beams
are≈16.4 and≈31.2 MeV, whereas the energy spread of
the higher energy beam is ≈1.2 MeV (5 %) in FWHM. The
charge and the FWHM divergence of electrons with kineticenergy ≥20 MeV are ≈4 pC and ≈20 mrad, respectively.
By slightly reducing the electron density ( ne/nc=0.03),
the self-injection is suppressed resulting in a negligible num-
ber of electrons being accelerated, which is in agreement with
the experimental measurements. In the opposite case, cor-
responding to a density increase to ne/nc=0.038, the laser
pulse peak amplitude in the focus is ≈1.8×higher than
a0. This case is characterized by fast laser energy depletion,
which manifests itself in the carrier frequency downshift and
slowing down of the pulse front36. After passing the focus,
the laser splits longitudinally into two distinct pulses, each
propagating at a different velocity and consisting of only a
few cycles. Due to the short duration of both pulses and the
relatively dense plasma, the rapid evolution of their carrier-
envelope phases causes oscillations of the wake wave cavi-
ties in the laser polarization direction as well as their lon-
gitudinal modulations, strongly affecting the parameters of
self-injected electrons26. Furthermore, the electrons injected
into the first period of the wake wave interact with the rear
part of the laser pulse. The resulting electron energy spec-
trum has thermal profile [Fig. 3(c)]. The cut-off energy is
≈39.2 MeV, the majority of electrons in the beam, however,
have energy <20 MeV. The charge of electrons with E≥1
and≥20 MeV, respectively, is ≈65 and 2 pC. The FWHM
divergence of electrons with E≥1 MeV is ≈100 mrad.
By further increasing the plasma density, i.e., operating at
ne/nc=0.042, the simulations indicate that the regime of
laser-plasma interaction does not change substantially. Even
though a larger fraction of electrons gets trapped, thus result-
ing in a higher beam charge, the pulse depletion is stronger,
which reduces both the acceleration length and the maxi-
mum reachable electron energy. Overall, the PIC simulations
clearly reproduce the transition from the quasi-monoenergetic
to the broadband electron energy spectra with the increase of
the plasma density over the same values observed experimen-
tally (Fig. 2).
Since the medical applications mentioned above rely on
high-current electron beams at relevant energies ( >20 MeV),
we optimize our LWFA source into two main modes of op-
eration, that are freely titled “high-energy mode” and “high-
power mode”. The high-energy mode, described above and
shown in Fig. 2(a), has the beam energy and collimation max-
imized by tweaking the laser-plasma interaction at the low-
est possible plasma density (given the available laser power).
In the high-power mode, the chosen approach is to optimize
the electron beam power by working with pure nitrogen at
higher plasma density of ne≈8.4×1019cm−3(equivalent to
ne/nc≈0.05), partially sacrificing the average peak energy
and collimation. The fact that higher beam charge can be ob-
tained at lower electron beam energies is likewise observed in
other experiments14. The key parameters of the two modes of
operation are summarized in Table I.
With our current setup in the high-power mode, we estimate
a dose rate exceeding 1 Gy /s for beam sizes of few mm, that
could lead to the first demonstration of laser-driven stereotac-
tic radiosurgery in a similar setup to the one described in25,
showing that approximately 600 shots were necessary to de-
posit 1 Gy into 1 cm3target volume. While medical devices5
for clinical use have more stringent requirements on beam sta-
bility and variability, other applications relying solely on the
dose rate and repetition rate such as space radiation hardness
testing37and radiobiology38,39are already possible.

In conclusion, we demonstrate the generation of quasi-
monoenergetic electron beams at 1 kHz repetition rate with
an unprecedented energy of tens of MeV (up to 50 MeV)
which paves the way towards establishing LWFA technology
as an innovative tool for treatment of small tumors (e.g., brain
metastasis) and for the generation of high-flux monoenergetic
x-ray beams in the medical imaging range (20 −50 keV).
The latter may represent a unique source for x-ray fluores-
cent imaging (XFI), phase contrast imaging (PCI), and micro-
beam radiotherapy. Consistent work is ongoing to produce a
stable and reliable high-energy ( >100 MeV), high-flux elec-
tron beamline for innovative user experiments. Finally, we
want to highlight that the all-reflection LWFA setup based on
OPCPA technology, shown in this work, is fully scalable in
laser power. This paves the way towards the realization of a
future GeV-class kHz electron beamline.
