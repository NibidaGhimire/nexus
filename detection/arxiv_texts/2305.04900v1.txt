Abstract
A manuscript’s writing style is central in determining its readership, inﬂuence, and impact. Past research
has shown that, in many cases, scholars present a unique writing style that is manifested in their manuscripts.
In this work, we report a comprehensive investigation into how scholars’ writing styles evolve throughout their
careers focusing on their academic relations with their advisors and peers. Our results show that scholars’ writing
styles tend to stabilize early on in their careers – roughly their 13th publication. Around the same time, scholars’
departures from their advisors’ writing styles seem to converge as well. Last, collaborations involving fewer
scholars, scholars from the same gender, or from the same ﬁeld of study seem to bring about greater change in
their co-authors’ writing styles with younger scholars being especially inﬂuenceable.
Keywords: Academic writing style, Scientiﬁc communication, Computational linguistics, time-dependent math-
ematical graphs.
1 Introduction
Academic publications play a crucial role in the advancement and dissemination of knowledge and information
[1]. In addition to many discipline-speciﬁc factors, such as scientiﬁc originality and validity, the way in which
the manuscript is written, also known as the manuscript’s style, is pivotal in determining its readership, inﬂuence,
and impact [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Speciﬁcally, a manuscript that is well-written, clear, easy to understand, and follows
a logical ﬂow and structure usually results in shorter reviewing time, higher readership, and greater attention
from subsequent literature and, in some cases, from the general and social media [7, 8, 9, 10]. It is important to
note that this phenomenon is not unique to academic publications and, in fact, it has been well documented for
news pieces [11], literature [12], and social media posts [13], to name a few. Research has shown that, in many
cases, scholars present a unique writing style (WS), resulting in impressively accurate authorship classiﬁcation and
proﬁling algorithms [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. However, as a collaboration among scholars has become increasingly
prevalent in modern science [19, 20, 21], so did the practice of collaborative writing [22, 23, 24], resulting in
many co-authored manuscripts having a “mixed style”. Namely, the individual style of each scholar is reﬂected
differently, and to a different extent, in the resulting co-authored manuscripts [25, 26].
Common to the literature in this realm is the focus on manuscripts as the unit of analysis [27]. In other
words, past research has predominantly considered each manuscript separately, analyzing its content and/or its’
(co-)authors’ identity or characteristics. However, research in WS considering scholars as the unit of analysis is
signiﬁcantly less prevalent.
WS changes have been extensively investigated from a social, cultural, and professional perspective [28, 29,
30, 31, 32]. For instance, [33] developed a computational model that can detect authors of online messages. The
authors show that parameters such as age, gender, and mother tongue are strong indicators, on average, for one’s
WS. In a similar manner, [34] show that gender is statistically associated with the WS of individuals in multiple
types of texts. Moreover, [35] show that, at the same point in time, authors from different ages have different

WS. [36] extended this line of work, showing that the same individuals changed their WS as they grow up from
children to adults. To the best of our knowledge, an investigation into how a scholar’s academic WS is evolving
and shaping throughout one’s career, especially considering its academic relations with his/her advisors and peers,
has yet to be examined in the literature.
In this work, we seek to address the following key questions:
• How does one’s WS signiﬁcantly change over time?
• How do research students (i.e., advisees) part from their advisors’ WS?
• How is a scholar’s WS affected by her collaborations?
To answer these questions, we develop a computational methodology combining a temporal graph repre-
sentation of co-authorship dynamics, natural language processing, and deep learning techniques. We apply our
methodology to real-world, large-scale bibliographic data from the Computer Science (CS) discipline consisting of
around 570 thousand CS scholars and 13.7 million indexed academic publications. Our results show that authors’
WS changes over time with some form of “WS convergence” occurring around one’s 13th published manuscript.
Similarly, scholars’ WS seem to part from their academic advisors’ WS early on in their careers, stabilizing around
the 14th published manuscript. Finally, several factors such as gender and ﬁeld of research are found to statistically
associate with one’s WS changes due to collaborations.
The remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows: Section 2, details the methods and data used in this
work. Section 3 outlines the results obtained from our analysis followed by their discussion in Section 4. Finally,
Section 5 draws conclusions, and highlights possible future work avenues.
2 Methods and Materials
Our methodology consists of three phases: First, we rely on the extensive CS literature indexed by the popular
DBLP dataset [37] and retrieve the original manuscripts and author proﬁles from CrossRef1and SciProﬁles2,
respectively. Second, the acquired data is used to populate a time-depended social graph-based mathematical
model. Third, the resulting non-trivial model is analyzed to address the three research questions introduced above.
Fig. 1 presents a schematic view of the study’s methodology.
2.1 Data acquisition
The DBLP database is a specialized bibliographic database that provides open bibliographic information on major
CS journals and conference proceedings with decent coverage and accuracy [38]. The database was retrieved on
March 20th, 2023 resulting in 14,301,639 publications. Using their DOIs (Digital Object Identiﬁers), 13,874,575
(97%) publications were matched to their original text using CrossRef and fully recovered in an HTML format.
1https://api.crossref.org/
2https://sciproﬁles.com/Draft: May 9, 2023 3
These publications were authored by 610,281 different authors. Using SciProﬁles, 593,513 (97.2%) were matched
and their proﬁles were retrieved. We ﬁlter out scholars who published over 500 manuscripts (less than 1%).
Overall, more than 13.7 Million CS publications, authored by more than 587 Thousand scholars are considered in
the following. On average, each author published 23:4240:44manuscripts in our data.
2.2 Model construction
It is important to note that formally representing the WS of any given text is a challenging task as no clear, agreed-
upon, deﬁnition of WS is currently available [26]. As such, prior computational studies that dealt with large
volumes of texts, which are self-evidently infeasible for domain experts to manually tag, adopted a data-driven
approach [39]. Speciﬁcally, deep-learning-based models are considered state-of-the-art in this realm [40]. For
our study, we align with prior work and represent a manuscript’s WS using a state-of-the-art model proposed by
[41]. The adopted model is based on the assumption that large pre-trained text-to-text artiﬁcial neural networks
encompass the textual WS that can be used to condition the decoder of a style Transfer-based models [42] through
a ﬁne-tuning procedure [41]. Technically, a text-to-text transformer model based on the T5 architecture called
TextSETTR [43], is adopted. TextSETTR generates a 1024-dimensional vector and accepts an arbitrarily long text
using the attention layer in the transformer model. The original developers of the model have shown that the model
outperforms the previous models in a wide range of settings. Of interest to our context, the model was shown to
align with WS expert opinions more than 80% of the time. This exceptional performance is obtained using the
Few-shot machine learning approach [44] which, unlike other approaches such as supervised or unsupervised
learning [45, 46], requires very few labeled training examples during inference. Taken jointly, these properties
make the proposed model seem especially suited for our research challenge.
By applying the TextSETTR model to a given manuscript we are provided with a representation of that
manuscript’s WS. However, for our purposes, we are mainly interested in representing a scholar’s WS . Accord-
ingly, if the manuscript is authored by a single scholar then that manuscript’s WS can be fully attributed to the
scholar alone at that time. However, if the manuscript is co-authored by several scholars, the resulting manuscript’s
WS is assumed to be a mixture of its co-authors’ prior WSs. In order to disentangle this WS mixture, we assume
that each part of the manuscript was written by a single scholar, as is commonly assumed in prior literature [47].
Accordingly, we perform the following process: First, we divide the manuscript into textual components such
that each one presents a distinct, yet consistent, WS. To that end, we utilize the state-of-the-art model proposed
by [14] which demonstrated 85% accuracy for this task on a large volume of documents. Once the division into
textual components is obtained, we use the TextSETTR model discussed above to get a vector representation of
each component in the text separately. Finally, we map each of the resulting WS vectors to their assumed source
(i.e., scholar) by matching each vector to the co-author who is currently represented by the most similar WS vector
using a standard Euclidean distance metric3. If a scholar is associated with a single component, then that com-
ponent’s WS is treated as that scholar’s WS in that point in time. However, if more than a single component is
associated with a scholar, then the proportional average of the components’ WS vectors is used instead. Clearly,
to perform the last step (i.e., components to scholars mapping), each co-author’s prior WS is needed. Assuming
a scholar has at least one single-authored manuscript, that manuscript’s WS can be used as a starting point for
our iterative procedure. Speciﬁcally, starting from a scholar’s ﬁrst solo-authored manuscript, the identiﬁed WS at
that time point is iteratively propagated to the proceeding and precluding manuscripts according to the procedure
outlined above. In other words, starting at each scholar’s ﬁrst single-authored manuscript, we use the obtained
WS to assign the components (and their WS) of the immediately proceeding and precluding manuscripts which,
in turn, are used for their proceeding and precluding manuscripts, and so on. Scholars without any single-authored
publications were omitted from further consideration (less than 3%).
2.3 Author-Manuscript Graph
To capture the collaboration and WS dynamics over time, we deﬁne a graph, G= (S;M;E ), where each scholar
is represented as a node in the graph s2S, each manuscript is represented as a different type of node in the graph
3Unlikely ties may result in a single component being assigned to multiple co-authors.Draft: May 9, 2023 4
m2M, and a directed edge e2EAPconnects each scholar to each of his/her manuscripts. Formally, a
scholar node s2Sis deﬁned by the tuple s:= (f;g)wherefis the scholar’s main ﬁeld of the study as indicated
by the name of its primary-associated department (e.g., computer science, mathematics, physics)4andgis the
scholar’s gender that can take one of the values fmale;female;unknown g. The scholar’s gender is obtained
according to a query to the model proposed by [48] which was trained on around 100 million pairs of names and
gender association, as collected by Yahoo! . A scholar’s gender is taken only if the model’s prediction conﬁdence
is higher than 95% (true for 94.6% of the scholars). A manuscript node m2Mis deﬁned by the WS vectors
associated with the manuscript’s components and the time the manuscript has been published, denoted by andt,
respectively. Last, an edge e= (s;m)2Eindicates that a scholar sis a (co-)author of the manuscript m. Overall,
we ﬁnd the main ﬁeld of study of 81:3%of the scholars and the gender of 94:6%. In total, 80.5% of scholars’
proﬁles included both parameters.
2.4 Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis is divided into three parts, each corresponding to one of our primary research questions.
WS Dynamics: To quantify the WS change over time for a given scholar, we deﬁne a function C:RN
RN!R+whereis the yearly average number (rounded to the closest natural number) of papers an author
publishes in a year. In addition, N2Nis the WS representation vector’s dimension. Formally, Caccepts a
list (L) of2NWS vectors corresponding to WS vectors published before a reference WS, u, which is also
provided toC:
C(L;u) :=jj1
X
v2L(v) ujj; (1)
wherejjxjjis theL1norm of a vector x. Intuitively, the above calculation quantiﬁes the extent to which a currently
exhibited WS is different compared to former WSs presented roughly during the preceding year.
WS Emergence: To capture how research students’ WS emerges, one needs to determine who were a student’s
advisors and when that student graduated. While some crowd-sourced advisor-advisee data is available by the
Mathematics Genealogy Project5and Academic Family Tree6, from our preliminary investigation, it does not
cover a signiﬁcant portion of our data. As such, we adopt a heuristic approach which was successfully applied
in prior works (e.g., [49]) where we consider the individual(s) a scholar has co-authored the most manuscripts
during their ﬁrst three publications years as their advisor(s). Note that this simple heuristic may capture both
“ofﬁcial” and “unofﬁcal” advisors alike, which seems favorable for our purposes. Formally, let us denote the set
of manuscripts the student and advisor(s) co-authored during the ﬁrst three years to be Aand:=jAj2N. Thus,
the student’s exposure to the advisor’s WS is set to be the average WS of the advisor from the manuscripts in
setA. Hence, the student’s style emergence function with respect to his/her advisor(s) ( A) is deﬁned as follows:
A(i) :RN!R+such thatA(u) =jj1
P
v2A(v) ujj, whereu2RNis the student’s WS vector one wishes to
compare with the baseline WS which is computed by1
P
v2A(v). Since we are interested in the temporal change
of a scholar’s WS, let us deﬁne uito be a scholar’s ithWS vector such that u0is the ﬁrst manuscript the scholar
published following the latest manuscript in A. Intuitively, we compare a currently exhibited WS to the advisor’s
average WS presented to the student as part of their co-authored manuscripts during the student’s training period.
WS and Collaborations: For each co-authored manuscript, we extract the following features: for each co-
author, we retrieve the main ﬁeld of study ( f), gender (g), and the number of previously published manuscripts.
The number of co-authors listed in the manuscript’s byline is also extracted. These values are considered as a

regular expression data standardization.

feature vector xfor our learning model. We deﬁne the scholar’s WS change which was observed due to a co-
authored manuscript as deﬁned by Eq. (1), to be the target value – denoted as y. Since the number of co-authors
can be arbitrary, we set x’s size to be the maximal size required by any manuscript in the database and padded the
non-required positions in xaccordingly.
The resulting dataset of samples, consisting of the features of each co-author as input and the observed WS
change as an output, is fed to a Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) automatic machine learning model
(AutoML) [50, 51] that is especially suited for complex regression tasks and seeks to minimize the predictions’
mean absolute error. Feature importance is computed and reported to determine the perceived inﬂuence each
parameter had on the prediction capability of the model [52].
In addition, we classify each WS change (i.e., y) to one of the following types: 1) towards the center of mass
(i.e., all co-authors’ WS move closer to the average WS of the group); 2) positive one-side change (i.e., the scholar
in question moves closer to the average WS of the group but the prior criterion is not met); 3) negative one-side
change (i.e., the scholar in question moves away from the average WS of the group) and 4) no clear change (i.e.,
if no other criteria are met). Accordingly, we perform a statistical analysis to determine if certain circumstances,
as detailed in the following analysis, are statistically associated with different WS change types using an ANOV A
test with post-hoc Tukey correction.
3 Results
WS Dynamics: Fig. 2 presents the authors’ WS changes over manuscripts, where jLj= 3. As one can notice,
for roughly the ﬁrst 12 published manuscripts, a scholar’s WS varies signiﬁcantly from one manuscript to the next.
From that point on, the scholar’s WS is notconstant (i.e., the WS change is not zero) yet the WS change seems
to be mild and relatively stable over time. In order to mathematically capture this phenomenon, we introduce a
threshold over the WS change to determine if and when a scholar’s WS has converged. Formally, the convergence
point,2N, for a threshold !2R+, is deﬁned as := minj 1

of this analysis are summarized in Table 1. Note that since not all scholars converge for a given threshold !, we
stated the percentage of scholars that did coverage given the speciﬁed threshold.

One may speculate that the WS change dynamics may be signiﬁcantly different for different scholars. In order
to examine this hypothesis, we used the classic k-mean algorithm adapted to time series data [53] using the popular
tslearn library [54]. Fig. 3 shows the L2intra metric for a different number of clusters on our data. Commonly,
when the data is inherently divided into k > 1clusters, one expects to witness an “elbow” in the graph which
reveals a point in which the decrease in the intra metric changes from large to small. However, as shown in the
ﬁgure, this is not the case here. Hence, the data does not seem to support this hypothesis.
WS Emergence: Fig. 4 presents the students’ WS emergence from the student’s graduation. The ﬁgure depicts
a sigmoid-like increase in the WS difference from one’s advisor(s) over manuscripts. Similarly to the analysis of
WS change over time, roughly around the graduate’s 14th publication, the difference from one’s advisor(s) seems
to converge to a relatively steady distance.
Let us consider the two authors of this paper as illustrative examples. Fig. 5 presents a 2-d standard PCA
dimensionality reduction projection of each of their ﬁrst 10 publications after graduation compared to their re-
spective advisors’ WS during their training periods. The second author (presented on the right), demonstrates a
rather consistent WS emergence pattern that moves away from his advisor’s WS in the same direction over time.Draft: May 9, 2023 6

WS and Collaboration: Since the number of features is considerably large due to the arbitrary number of co-
authors in each manuscript, we focused on the four factors summarized in Table 2. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst consider
the genders involved in the co-authored manuscript, and for each examined scholar we classify each co-authored
manuscript into one of four categories: 1) All male (i.e., all co-authors are male); 2) Male-Mix (i.e., the scholar
in question is Male and the remaining co-authors consist of both male and female co-authors); 3) Female-MixDraft: May 9, 2023 8
(i.e., the scholar in question is Female and the remaining co-authors consist of both male and female co-authors);
4) All female (i.e., all co-authors are female). We then consider whether the ﬁeld of research of all co-authors
is the same or not (acknowledging minor differences such as word order and the insigniﬁcance of generic terms
such as “department” or “faculty”). The “number of co-authors” factor refers to the number of authors listed in
a manuscript’s byline and the previous publications factor refers to the number of prior publications made by the
scholar in question. For each of these factors, the average importance of changing one’s WS is presented. In
addition, the statistical relation between each value and a speciﬁc type of WS change is reported.

4 Discussion
Let us revisit the original research questions posed for this study.
First, we have asked “How does one’s WS signiﬁcantly change over time?”. The results seem to indicate
that the vast majority of scholars exhibit an evolving WS which, at ﬁrst, presents a cluttered behavior that soon
converges to mild and steady changes around their 13th manuscript. The fact that one’s WS converges to small and
steady changes between one manuscript to the next is somewhat intuitive as it reﬂects the process of forming one’s
unique academic personality, style, and practices which are ever-evolving. However, the fact that this convergence
occurs early in one’s career is, to us, very surprising. In our data, on average, convergence occurs after four
publication years. This means that the scholars’ WS “learning curve” has ﬂattened extremely early. One possible
explanation may be the infamous pressure to publish extensively during one’s ﬁrst years in academia, partially,
to secure a permanent position [55]. Speciﬁcally, during these ﬁrst years a scholar may avoid the long, arguably
needed, process of perfecting their WS in exchange for improving their body of work.
Second, we have asked “How do research students (i.e., advisees) part from their advisors’ WS?”. The results
seem to suggest that the distance between one’s WS and his/her advisors’ WS is increasing in a sigmoid-like
fashion until convergence is reached around one’s 14th publication. Interestingly, this convergence seems to agree
with the one obtained from the previous analysis as well. The observed pattern seems to align with the historically
observed dynamics of apprenticeship [56]. The results also demonstrate an increasing pattern in standard deviation
presented in Fig. 4. These indicate that one’s departure from his/her advisors’ WS is very personal, aligning with
the results of a recent study dedicated to the advisor-advisee collaboration patterns in Computer Science [57].
Last, we have asked “How is a scholar’s WS affected by her collaborations?”. The results point to several
statistically signiﬁcant factors that seem to govern the way collaborations inﬂuence one’s WS. Starting with gender,
it is found to be the least inﬂuential factor out of the examined ones. Interestingly, while the interactions betweenDraft: May 9, 2023 9
males and females are symmetric in the sense that, statistically, they do not have a speciﬁc way of changing one’s
WS, interactions between the same gender result in different outcomes. This outcome agrees with a wide range
of prior studies about collaborations and gender [58, 59, 60]. The ﬁeld of research seems to play a slightly more
central role. Speciﬁcally, co-authors from the same ﬁeld are well inﬂuenced by each other’s WS while co-authors
from different ﬁelds are not. This result is, perhaps, counter-intuitive as one could expect scholars from different
disciplines to have a greater impact on each other as they are accustomed to slightly different writing standards
and practices. However, this result is similar in spirit to how scholars react and adopt ideas from peers within and
outside their research ﬁeld [61]. In addition, the number of co-authors encompasses great importance in predicting
the WS change due to collaboration. Albeit statistically insigniﬁcant, when there are only two co-authors, both
seem to learn from each other and slightly adopt each other’s WS. However, when three co-authors are concerned,
and especially when more than three are considered, scholars are less inﬂuenced by their co-authors’ WS. The
most signiﬁcant factor is the previous number of manuscripts a scholar has. Similar to the results discussed earlier
for the student-advisor dynamics, young scholars (in terms of published manuscripts) tend to be more inﬂuenced
by others’ WS compared to more experienced authors which have already established a personal WS and thus are
less prone to changes.
5 Conclusions
In this study, we explored how scholars’ writing styles evolve throughout their careers focusing on their academic
relations with their advisors and peers. To this end, we proposed and implemented a computational framework
that captures how scholars’ WS changes over time due to co-authorship and advisor-advisee relationships. The ob-
tained results point to several intriguing phenomena which, in addition to their fundamental role in understanding
academic WS dynamics, can be instrumental in designing better Ph.D. and young faculty programs.
It is important to note that the proposed model and analysis are not without limitations. First, our analysis
focuses on the Computer Science discipline. In future work, we intend to extend our analysis to include addi-
tional disciplines which need not necessarily align with the practices and standards of Computer Science (e.g.,
Humanities and Social Sciences). Second, several parts of our implementation, such as the co-author’s compo-
nents mapping, are inaccurate almost by deﬁnition. Thus, the raw results used for our analysis are not without
noise and errors. Improving these components could lead to more robust outcomes and conclusions. Finally, the
proposed analysis does not take into consideration additional social and cultural features that might also govern
scholars’ WS and its changes [62]. For example, a scholar’s nationality may likely play a central role in shaping
his/her WS and its dynamics. We intend to explore this and additional socio-demographic features in the future.
