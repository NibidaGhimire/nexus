1.Introduction
The purpose of this note is to give a detailed explanation on h ow to arrive to the formulae
(3.11 - 3.12) in [ MRZ23 ] giving rise to an explicit natural transformation
Sz:C=⇒G
between two functors that we now recall. Denote by sSetthe category of simplicial sets and
byCatsSetthe category of categories enriched over the monoidal categ ory of simplicial sets
with cartesian product. The functor C:sSet→CatsSetis the left adjoint of the homotopy
coherent nerve functor deﬁned by Cordier to make sense of hom otopy coherent diagrams
and used by Lurie to compare two models for the theory of ∞-categories. Conceptually, C
provides a combinatorial construction that allows to think of a simplicial set as a category
with higher structure on the morphisms described in terms of sequences of simplices con-
necting two vertices. The functor G:sSet→CatsSetis the left adjoint of Kan’s classifying
space construction usually denoted by W:CatsSet→sSet, and was used by Dwyer and
Kan to recast the theory of homotopy types in terms of simplic ial groupoids (after formally
inverting all morphisms). Conceptually, the localized ver sion ofGwas used in the litera-
ture to provide a combinatorial model of the path category (t he many object version of the
topological monoid of based loops) in terms of a simplicial s et presenting a homotopy type.
We recall the precise deﬁnitions of CandGbelow.
The explicit formula we shall derive for the natural transfo rmation Szis reminiscent of
a map deﬁned by Szczarba in terms of certain "simplicial oper ators" when comparing two
chain models for a ﬁbration. [ Szc61]. This is the reason why we call SztheSzczarba map .
This note may be taken as a companion to section 3 of [ MRZ23 ], where we show that
Szinduces a weak equivalence after localizing both CandGin the context of comparing
diﬀerent combinatorial models for the based loop space and p ath category.
2.The functors GandC
Denote by ∆n∈sSetthe standard n-simplex. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne two poset-enriched
categories PG(∆n)andPC(∆n).
Deﬁnition 2.1. The objects of PG(∆n)are the elements of [n] ={0,1,...,n}. Given
0≤k≤n, let/an}bracketle{tgk/an}bracketri}htn−kdenote the poset
/an}bracketle{tgk/an}bracketri}htn−k={dn−k
1gk≤dn−k−1
1d0gk≤ ··· ≤d1dn−k−1
0gk≤dn−k
0gk}.
Forn=k, let/an}bracketle{tgk/an}bracketri}ht0={gk}be the trivial poset. The idea here is that gkis the unique
non-degenerate (n−k)-simplex in N/an}bracketle{tgk/an}bracketri}htn−k∼=∆n−k, and the elements of the poset are
the vertices of gk. Recall an ℓ-simplex xin the nerve of a poset Pis precisely an ordered
collection (x1≤x2≤ ··· ≤xℓ)of elements in P.
For0≤p < q≤n, deﬁne
(2.1) PG(∆n)(p,q) =/an}bracketle{tgq/an}bracketri}htn−q×/an}bracketle{tgq−1/an}bracketri}htn−(q−1)×···×/an}bracketle{t gp+1/an}bracketri}htn−(p+1),
and forp=q, setPG(∆n)(q,q) ={idq}, the trivial poset. The composition rule for PG(∆n)
is given by the cartesian product of sequences (i.e. freely c oncatenating sequences).
12 E. MINICHIELLO, M. RIVERA, AND M. ZEINALIAN
For example, the poset-enriched category PG(∆2)looks like
(2.2)1
0 2/an}bracketle{tg1/an}bracketri}ht1={d1g1≤d0g1}/an}bracketle{tg2/an}bracketri}ht0={g2}
/an}bracketle{tg2/an}bracketri}ht0×/an}bracketle{tg1/an}bracketri}ht1={(g2,d1g1)≤(g2,d0g1)}
Note that every arrow in the above picture is a poset.
With the cosimplicial maps given in [ MRZ23 , Deﬁnition 3.2], [n]/mapsto→PG(∆n)deﬁnes a
cosimplicial poset-enriched category.
Deﬁnition 2.2. The objects of PC(∆n)are the elements of [n] ={0,1,...,n}. Given
0≤p < q≤n, letPC(p,q)denote the poset whose elements are subsets of the form
U={p,i1,...,iℓ,q} ⊆ {p,p+1,...,q−1,q}and we let U≤Vif and only if V⊆U. For
p=q, letPC(q,q) ={q}be the trivial poset. The composition rule for PC(∆n)is given by
taking union of subsets.
For example, the poset-enriched category PC(∆2)looks like
1
0 2{0,1}{1,2}
{0,1,2}≤{0,2}
Note that every arrow in the above picture is a poset.
With the cosimplicial maps given in [ MRZ23 , Deﬁnition 3.7], [n]/mapsto→PC(∆n)deﬁnes a
cosimplicial poset-enriched category.
Any poset-enriched category gives rise to a simplicial cate gory by applying the nerve
functor at the level of posets of morphisms; we denote this fu nctor by
NCat:CatPoset→CatsSet,
and deﬁne C(∆n) =NCat(PC(∆n))andG(∆n) =NCat(PG(∆n)). These constructions
completely determine two functors CandGfromsSettoCatsSetthrough Kan extension
since the category CatsSetis cocomplete. Namely, for any arbitrary simplicial set Xwe
deﬁne
C(X) :=colim
∆n→XC(∆n)
and
G(X) :=colim
∆n→XG(∆n).
3.An explicit formula for the Szczarba map
In [Hin07 , Section 2.6.1], Hinich deﬁnes a map of cosimplicial poset- enriched categories
Hin:PC(∆•)→PG(∆•).
It is deﬁned as the identity on objects and on posets of morphi sms
Hin:PC(∆n)(p,q)→PG(∆n)(p,q)
is given on “indecomposable" elements by
Hin({p,q}) = (dn−q
1gq, dn−q
1d0gq−1, ... , dn−q
1dq−(p+1)
0gp+1).A DETAILED LOOK AT THE SZCZARBA MAP 3
Then on any element U={p,i1,...,iℓ,q} ∈PC(∆n)(p,q), withp < i1< i2<···< iℓ< q,
one may deﬁne
Hin({p,i1,...,iℓ,q}) = (Hin({iℓ,q}), ... , Hin({p,i1})).
Example 3.1. For{0,2,4}inPC(∆5)(0,5), we have
Hin({0,2,4}) = (Hin({2,4}),Hin({0,2}))
= (d1g4,d1d0g3,d3
1g2,d3
1d0g1).
The goal is to obtain an explicit formula for the morphism of s implicial categories
NCatHin:C(∆n)→G(∆n).
We shall denote this functor of simplicial categories by Sz∆n.
It is enough to consider the non-degenerate ℓ-simplices of C(∆n)(p,q). For a ﬁxed n≥1,
let0≤p < q≤nand0≤ℓ≤q−p−1. Consider the set nd (C(∆n)(p,q)ℓ)of non-degenerate
ℓ-simplices of C(∆n)(p,q). There is an obvious bijection nd (C(∆n)(p,q)ℓ)∼=Sℓ
p,q, where
Sℓ
p,q={i= (i1,...,iℓ)∈ {p+1,...,q−1}×ℓ:ir/ne}ationslash=is,forr/ne}ationslash=s}.
Forℓ= 0, we setS0
p,q={∅}, and we call ∅the empty sequence. From now on, we identify
sequences (i1,...,iℓ)as above with non-degenerate ℓ-simplices in C(∆n)(p,q).
Given an ℓ-simplex
i= ({p,i1,...,iℓ,q} ≤ {p,i1,...,iℓ−1,q} ≤ ··· ≤ { p,i1,q} ≤ {p,q}),
we shall describe a formula for the resulting ℓ-simplex
Sz∆n(i) =NCatHin(i)∈G(∆n)(p,q)ℓ=N(/an}bracketle{tgq/an}bracketri}htn−q)ℓ×N(/an}bracketle{tgq−1/an}bracketri}htn−(q−1))ℓ×···×N(/an}bracketle{tgp+1/an}bracketri}htn−(p+1))ℓ.
Therefore Sz∆n(i)will have components corresponding to each gkforp+1≤k≤q. For
each ﬁxed k, we shall give a formula for the k-th component Sz∆n(i)k=Ei,kgk, in terms of a
simplicial operator Ei,kthat will be deﬁned inductively. Note Ei,kgkmust be an ℓ-simplex in
N(/an}bracketle{tgk/an}bracketri}htn−k)∼=∆n−k, so it is enough to specify all of its ℓ+1vertices. Lets use the notation
[xℓ,xℓ−1,...,x 0], where0≤xℓ≤ ··· ≤x0≤n−k, to denote the ℓ-simplex corresponding
toEi,kgkin∆n−k.
Example 3.2. For the2-simplex corresponding to
{0,3} ≥ {0,2,3} ≥ {0,1,2,3}
we obtain the 2-simplex
(g3,d0g2,d2
0g1)≥(g3,d1g2,d1d0g1)≥(g3,d1g2,d2
1g1).
Writing this component-wise as
g3≤g3≤g3
d1g2≤d1g2≤d0g2
d2
1g1≤d1d0g1≤d2
0g1
we can see that for each kwith1≤k≤3, we obtain a 2-simplex in N/an}bracketle{tgk/an}bracketri}ht3−k∼=∆3−k.
These are given by
k= 3,[000]
k= 2,[001]
k= 1,[012].
Thus for k= 2, we have x0= 1,x1= 0andx2= 0.4 E. MINICHIELLO, M. RIVERA, AND M. ZEINALIAN
For a ﬁxed k, it is easy to obtain x0, as it will appear in Hin ({p,q})asdn−q
1dq−k
0gk, which
corresponds to the vertex q−kin the poset /an}bracketle{tgk/an}bracketri}htn−k. Thusx0=q−kfor every k.
Now suppose we start with i=∅, corresponding to {p,q}andx0and add i1to it. We
thus wish to compute x1. But we will need to know the data of i1. In fact all the higher xℓ
will depend on the sequence (i1,...,iℓ−1). We deﬁne a function
αk:Sℓ
p,q→ {0,...,n−k}
so that
xℓ=αk(i1,...,iℓ−1).
As mentioned, we have αk(∅) =q−k.
When we add i1, we obtain a 1-simplex Hin ({p,q})≥Hin({p,i1,q}), which gives
(dn−q
1gq,...,dn−q
1dq−(i1+1)
0gi1+1,dn−q
1dq−i1
0gi1,dn−q
1dq−(i1−1)
0gi1−1,...,dn−q
1dq−(p+1)
0gp+1)
≥(dn−q
1gq,...,dn−q
1dq−(i1+1)
0gi1+1, dn−i1
1gi1, dn−i1
1d0gi1−1, ... ,dn−i1
1di1−(p+1)
0gp+1)
Note that for k > i 1, the coeﬃcients for gkdo not change. For k≤i1, we see that
the vertex x1corresponds to dn−i1
1di1−k
0gk, which is the (i1−k)-th element of the linear
ordering /an}bracketle{tgk/an}bracketri}htn−k. Thus we have
x1=αk(i1) =/braceleftBigg
αk(∅)k > i1
i1−k k≤i1.
We now compute αk(i1,...,iℓ)given we have computed
αk(∅),αk(i1),...,α k(i1,...,iℓ−1).
This corresponds to the 1-simplex Hin ({p,i1,...,iℓ−1,q})≥Hin({p,i1,...,iℓ,q}). In
order to see which of the gkwill be aﬀected, we must know where iℓappears amongst the
i1,...,iℓ−1if they are put in order.
For this we deﬁne ω(i1,...,iℓ−1)(iℓ)to be the largest integer in {p,i1,...,iℓ−1,q}such that
ω(i1,...,iℓ−1)(iℓ)< iℓ. This number will tell us the lower bound for the range of kfor which
the coeﬃcients of gkwill not change. Within the range ω(i1,...,iℓ−1)(iℓ)< k≤iℓ, we know
that the coeﬃcient of gkwill change to dn−iℓ
1diℓ−k
0gk, by inspecting what happens within
Hinich’s formula. This is the (iℓ−k)-th element of the linear ordering of /an}bracketle{tgk/an}bracketri}htn−k. Outside
of this range, we know that the coeﬃcients for gkwill not change. Thus we deﬁne
(3.1) αk(i1,...,iℓ) =/braceleftBigg
iℓ−k, ω (i1,...,iℓ−1)(iℓ)< k≤iℓ
αk(i1,...,iℓ−1), k≤ω(i1,...,iℓ−1)(iℓ)oriℓ< k.
For any sequence i= (i1,...,iℓ)we have constructed [xℓxℓ−1...x0]corresponding to the ℓ-
simplexEi,kgkinN(/an}bracketle{tgk/an}bracketri}htn−k)∼=∆n−k. From the sequence [xℓxℓ−1...x0]we wish to obtain
a simplicial operator Ei,k, deﬁned inductively, such that xr=dℓ−r
1dr
0(Ei,kgk). Namely, xris
therth vertex of the ℓ-simplex Ei,kgk.
So assuming Ei′,kgk= [xℓ−1...x0], where i′= (i1,...,iℓ−1), we wish to know what
simplicial operator we need in order to produce Ei,kgk= [xℓxℓ−1...x0]thinking of gkas
[0 1...(n−k)]. Ifxℓ=xℓ−1, then this is easy, namely we need only set Ei,k=s0Ei′,k, since
[xℓ−1xℓ−1...x0] =s0[xℓ−1...x0].
Ifxℓ< xℓ−1, we can obtain Ei,kgkfromEi′,kgkby noticing
sxℓ+1
0dxℓ
0[0 1...(n−k)] = [xℓ...xℓ...xℓ(xℓ+1)...xℓ−1...xℓ−2...x0...(n−k)]
Then applying E′
i′,k, where the superscript′means to add one to every index in the simplicial
operator, will "skip over" the ﬁrst xℓand will then "cross out" everything else but Ei′,kgk=A DETAILED LOOK AT THE SZCZARBA MAP 5
[xℓ−1xℓ−2...x0], but now this will be placed after the additional xℓ, leaving
Ei,kgk= [xℓxℓ−1...x0].
It follows that the desired operators Ei,kmay be deﬁned by induction on ℓ, the length of i,
as follows. For the empty sequence, deﬁne
E∅,k=dn−q
1dq−k
0.
Suppose we have deﬁned Ei,kfor anyiof length less than ℓ. Ifihas length ℓ, deﬁne
(3.2) Ei,k=/braceleftBigg
s0Ei′,k ifαk(i′) =αk(i)
E′
i′,ksαk(i)+1
0dαk(i)
0 ifαk(i)< αk(i′).
In summary, we have shown that the map
Sz∆n=NCat(Hin):C(∆n)(p,q)→G(∆n)(p,q)
is given on any
i= ({p,i1,...,iℓ,q} ≤ {p,i1,...,iℓ−1,q} ≤ ··· ≤ { p,i1,q} ≤ {p,q})∈C(∆n)(p,q)ℓ
by the formula
Sz∆n(i) = (Ei,qgq,Ei,q−1gq−1, ... ,Ei,p+2gp+2,Ei,p+1gp+1)∈G(∆n)(p,q)ℓ.
We ﬁnish by repeating Example 3.15 from [ MRZ23 ].
Example 3.3. Consider the 2-simplex in C(∆3)(0,3)2given by
{0,3} ≥ {0,2,3} ≥ {0,1,2,3}.
This simplex corresponds to the sequence i= (2,1). So with n= 3, p= 0, q= 3, we
compute
α3(∅) = 0, α2(∅) = 1, α1(∅) = 2
ω∅(2) = 0, α3(2) = 0, α2(2) = 0, α1(2) = 1
(3.3) ω(2)(1) = 0, α3(2,1) = 0, α2(2,1) = 0, α1(2,1) = 0.
With this we can then compute
(3.4)Sz∆3(i) = (E(2,1),3g3,E(2,1),2g2,E(2,1),1g1)
= (s0E(2),3g3, s0E(2),2g2,E′
(2),1s0g1)
= (s2
0E∅,3g3, s0E′

= (s2
0g3, s0d1s0g2, d2
2s2
1g1)
= (s2
0g3, s0g2, g1).
A similar computation gives
Sz∆3(1,2) = (s2
0g3, s1g2, s0d1g1).
We include a diagram illustrating the map Sz∆3:C(∆3)(0,3)→G(∆3)(0,3).6 E. MINICHIELLO, M. RIVERA, AND M. ZEINALIAN
