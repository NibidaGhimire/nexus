Abstract  
In this paper we make an attempt to increase our understanding of the urban scaling 
phenomenon. The aim is to investigate how superlinear scaling emerges if a network 
increases in size and how this scaling depends on the occurrence of elements that constitute 
the network. To this end  we consider a city as a complex network structure and simulate this 
structure by the network of all publicat ions of a research intensive university. In this 
simulation the publications take the role of the city inhabitants and the concepts (terms, 
keywords) in the publications represent all kinds of abilities and  qualities of the inhabitants. 
We use in this experiment all author - and database -given terms of the scientific publications 
of Leiden University  from 2022.  We calculate  the co-occurrence of terms, and on the basis of 
these connections  we create a network  and let this network grow by successively adding 
publicat ions from the total set of publications. In this way  we get a series of networks with 
different size s and this simulates a series of cit ies with different number of inhabitants. This 
procedure is performed for different values of the term occurrence threshold. We then 
analyze how four important network parameter s, namely number of terms, number of 
clusters, number of links, an d total link  strength increase  with increasing size of the 
network.  Particularly the number of network links and the total network linkage strength are 
in our opinion the parameters that dominate the scaling phenomenon  and can be considered 
as a simulation of the socio-economic strength of a city, i.e., its gross urban product . We 
find a significant power law dependence  of these network parameters  on network size  and 
the power law exponents for the lowe st occurrence threshold are within the range that is 
typical for urban scaling.  In our approach the number o f clusters can be interpreted as a 
measure of complexity within the network. Since the occurrence threshold determines the 
diversity of terms, we may expect a special relation between the occurrence threshold and 
the number of clusters. This is indeed the case: whereas for the three other network 
parameters the scaling exponent increases with increasing occurrence threshold, the number 
of clusters is the only network parameter of which the scaling exponent decreases with 
increasing occurrence threshold. Finally, we dis cuss how our publication term network 
approach relates to scaling phenomena in cities.

 1. Introduction   
Recent studies show a more than proportional  (superlinear) increase of the socioeconomic 
performance of cities (measured by the gross urban product) in relation to population size 
(Bettencourt  et al.,  2007; Bettencourt  et al ., 2010; Lobo, Bettencourt et al. , 2013 ; 
Bettencourt and Lobo , 2016; Cebrat and Sobczy≈Ñski , 2016; Barthelemy , 2019a,b). If 
individual cities  i with population  ùëÉùëñ  have a gross urban product ùê∫ùëñ (ùëÉùëñ) then we find for a set 
of cities , for example all cities within a country, the relation   
ùê∫(ùëÉ)=ùê¥ùëÉùëè           (1)  
This urban scaling  relation implies a power -law dependence of the gross urban product with 
population  size. The coefficient ùê¥ and the  exponent b follow  from the measurement; in most 
cases, values of the exponent are between 1. 05 and 1.2 5. We refer to our recent work on 
urban scaling for further details (van Raan , 2016;  2020). As an example we give in Figure  1 
the urban scaling of the major cities in the Netherlands .

Netherlands . The central cities are indicated with blue diamonds (C), their urban agglomerations with 
red squares (A). Data are the average for the years 2020 -2022. 
 
Urban scaling behavior is also found for other city characteristics such as employment in 
terms of nu mber of jobs, number of crimes, total road length  and knowledge production 
activities in cities ( Bettencourt  et al., 2007; Arbesman  et al.,  2009;  Alves et al., 2013; 
Schl√§pfer  et al., 2014).  
A simple way to understand the phenomenon of urban scaling is by seeing cities as a 
complex network. The larger the city in population size, the more network nodes. The nodes 
in the urban system are abilities and capacities of the inhabitants, social and cultural 
institutions, centers of education and research, firms, etcetera. The number of nodes has a 
linear  dependence on size, but the links between nodes depend on size in a superlinear way. 
3 
 The links between these (clustered)  nodes represent many types of exchange activities such 
as movement of people, transportation of goods, transmission of information ( Shutters et 
al., 2018), exchange of ideas and expertise. Therefore, these links are crucial for new 
developments, reinforce ment of urban facilities, and innovation. One can expect that the 
productivity and efficiency of an urban economy increases as the level of connectivity among 
the constituent units increases. Because they increase superlinearly, the socioeconomic 
strength of cities increases more than proportionally with increasing population size. In this 
way, c ities can be conceived as a complex network structure (Qian et al., 2020; Stier et al., 
2022) following scaling laws (Batty, 2008 ; 2009).   
 
The measurement of urban scaling is complicated by a number of problems. Scaling 
characteristics may depend on the definition of cities in terms of population size and 
population density  of the urban area , and even on the size of a city measured in terms of 
residents and of working population size (Strumsky et al., 2021) . These d ifferent definitions 
of cities can lead to finding l inear scaling in situations where other researchers find 
superlinear scaling (Arcaute et al., 2015 ; Cottineau et al., 2017 ). The scali ng exponent can 
even change from superlinear to sublinear (Louf and Barthelemy, 2014 a). The chosen set of 
cities may also lead to different scaling exponents (Cebrat and Sobczy≈Ñski, 2016; van Raan, 
2020; Sahasranaman and Bettencourt, 2021).  For cities in the richer western part of the EU 
a lower scaling exponent was found as compared to cities in the less rich eastern part of the 
EU (Strano and Sood, 2016) . Scaling exponents may also vary in time (Cebrat and 
Sobczy≈Ñski, 2016;  Strano and Sood , 2016; Depersin and Bathelemey, 2018; Bettencourt et 
al. 2020; Strumsky et al., 2021 ). Scaling exponents differ for the various variables such as 
for instance gross domestic product, employment and number of  patents (Bettencourt and 
Lobo, 2016) . Ramaswami  et al (2018)  show that the economic structure of cities may 
considerably affect the measured urban scaling exponents. An Australian study (Sarkar et  
al., 2018; Sarkar, 2019) shows that scaling exponents may also differ within a broader 
variable: for lower income the scaling is about linear but for high income the scaling is 
superlinear. Leit√£o et al. (2016) discuss the problems in  the statistical estimation of scaling 
exponents . Nevertheless, a n extensive  study o n urban scaling in Brazil (Meirelle s et al., 
2018)  using a large number of variables and different statistical approaches shows that 
socioeconomic variables (e.g., GUP) scale superlinearly with city population size, whereas 
infrastructural variables (e.g., length of street network) scale su blinearly and individual basic 
services (e.g., number of houses) scale linearly.  
 
In understanding urban scaling, it is generally assumed that t he scaling of urban economic 
performance is driven by social and economic interactions that increase disproporti onally 
with urban population size. Ribeiro et al . (2017) for instance discus s a model of  urban 
scaling based on the distant -dependent interaction range between the citizens and on the 
spatial structure  of a city . Altmann (2020)  studies  interactions between individuals in 
different cities and shows that including these inter-city interactions leads to better scaling 
models .  
There are several important studies on the theoretical derivation of urban scaling based on 
mathematical framework s (Bathelemy, 2019 a,b; Bettencourt, 2019 ), often related to 
statistical physics . Lobo et al . (2020) use a theoretical settlement model to explain urban 
scaling. The growth of cities is studied, for instance, by a diffusion -limited aggregation model 4 
 (Makse  et al., 1995) and by a population dy namics model (Reia et al ., 2022). A theoretical 
framework of local interactions  was used to study scaling properties of cities ( Bettencourt 
and West, 2010; Bettencourt, 2013).  Our approach is not a theoretical, mathematical 
construction, but an experiment with a ‚Äò real-world ‚Äô growing network of which the parameters 
are measured as a function of network size. Thus our study poses a specific question about 
scaling, namely can we discover scaling properties similar t o urban scaling if we analyze the 
linkage structure of a growing network and can we find how this scaling depends on the 
occurrence of elements that constitute the network. We think that this is a novel approach in 
research on urban scaling.  
There are man y studies on the properties of network structure s, cluster formation , 
community detection  and connectivity of nodes ( Barabasi and Albert, 1999; Jin et al., 2001; 
Newman, 2004; Newman and Girvan, 2004; Newman, 2006; Traag  et al., 2011; Fortunato 
and Newman,  2022). Network approaches have been  applied to study how cities evolve 
(Batty, 2008 ; 2013), and f or instance Lenormand et al . (2015) use an network approach to 
develop clustering methods for the study of scaling in land use organization in cities. 
However , there is little research on the enlargement of real-world  networks (i.e., constructed 
with elements from existing systems as opposed to theoretical constructions)  and its relation 
with connectivity (number of links, total link strength) and clustering (number of clusters) , 
and, in particular , the scaling of these network parameters as a function of network size . 
Thus, to the best of our knowledge there are no studies that relate urban scaling phenomena 
to scaling properties of growing networks.     
 
As we stated earlier , urban scaling is fundamental ly based on social interactions . In this 
approach a city is a network of social interactions and t he total number of interactions is 
directly related to the socio -economic output of cities . This directly relat es to research on 
economic models of agglomeration effects that are based on an increasing productivity 
derived from social interactions (Glaeser et  al., 1995 ; Meijers et al., 2016 ; Strumsky et al. 
2023). Cottineau et al. (2019) analyse  urban clusters to detect agglomeration economies.      
 
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 addresses our method and data, and in 
particular why we simulate a city with a university. In Section 3 we present and discuss our 
results. We con clude this paper in Section 4 with a discussion of the implications for urban 
scaling.  
2.  Method  and Data  
2.1 Simulating a city with a university  
In an earlier study (van Raan 2013) we found that also universities show a scaling behavior 
similar to cities. Whereas for cities the gross urban product is an important measure of 
socio-economic strength, for universities the extent to which all publications of a university 
are cited worldw ide is an important measure of the scientific strength of the university. It is 
this analogy that we use to simulate the urban network in order to find and analyze scaling 
properties. Our aim is to investigate how superlinear scaling emerges if a network i ncreases 
in size , and how this scaling depends on the occurrence of elements that constitute the 
network. To this end we consider a city as a complex network structure and simulate this 
structure by the network of all publications in a research intensive u niversity. In this 5 
 simulation the publications take the role of the city inhabitants and the concepts (terms, 
keywords) in the publications represent all kinds of abilities and qualities of the inhabitants. 
We then assume that the total links strength of t he publication terms network is a analogon 
of the socioeconomic performance of a city. In this way we investigate scaling of growing 
networks in an empirical approach.   
We use in this experiment all author - and database -given keywords of the scientific 
publications of Leiden University from 2022 . Using publications of a large university means 
that one covers all fields of science, and this also resembles a city: a very heterogenous 
content within one coherent system.  Just like a city, a university is a not an isolated system 
but a s ystem of which the content is strongly related  with the outside world.  
We calculate the co -occurrence of terms, and on the basis of these connections we create a 
network and let this network grow by successively adding public ations from the total set of 
publications. In this way we get a series of networks with different , increasing  sizes and this 
simulates a series of cities with different number of inhabitants. This procedure is performed 
for different values of the term occ urrence threshold. We then analyze how four important 
network parameters, namely number of terms, number of clusters, number of links, and 
total link strength increase with increasing size of the network. Particularly the number of 
network links and the to tal network linkage strength are the parameters that dominate the 
scaling phenomenon and can be considered as a simulation of the socio -economic strength 
of a city, i.e., its gross urban product.  
 
Shutters et al. (2018) find that t he increase in network d ensity is for an important part 
driven by the presence of rare, but highly interdependent occupations in a city. This supports 
our approach to particularly include rare terms (i.e., by using low occurrence thresholds, see 
next section) in the network const ruction. For examples of bibliometric (e.g., co -citation, 
term co -occurrence) networks we refer to Price (1965); Braam et al., 1991; Lehmann et al 
2003; Ren et al. (2012); Martin et al., 2013; Golosovsky and Solomon (2017); Muppidi and 
Reddy (2020). An overview of bibliometric network analysis is given by Perianes -Rodriguez  
et al. (2016).  
 
A particularly  interesting paper for our study is the work on the spatial structure of mobility 
networks in cities (Louail et al ., 2014; 2015; Louf and Ba rthelemy , 2013; 2014b; 2016). 
These authors find that the number of hotspots (urban activity cent ers) scales sublinearly 
with city population size and they remark that this finding may serve as a guide for 
constructing a theoretical model. As we will see further  on in this paper, we find a similar 
scaling behavior in our simulation network . 
2.2 Creating a network  
Given that publications can be characterized by a number of terms, a matrix of publication -
to-term relations can be constructed. Using linear algebra, from  this matrix a new matrix of 
term-to-term relations can be deduced (van Raan , 2019). The off -diagonal elements of this 
term-to-term (term co -occurrence ) matrix indicate the number of publications in which the 
two terms involved are both present, i.e., the co-occurrence frequency  of this pair of terms. 
The larger the number of publications in which two terms co -occur, the stronger the terms 
are conside red to be related to each other, i.e., the stronger their link. The network grows 6 
 with the number of publica tions, but the network itself is a structure of interconnected 
terms.  This is similar to what we want to simulate: the size of cities is determined by the 
number of inhabitants, whereas the real basis of the urban scaling phenomenon is the 
network of interactions between all possible abilities and qualities of these inhabitants. The 
size of a city therefore is a kind of an  easy measurable, proxy independent variable.   
In order to construct and to visualize this bibliometric network we apply the software tool 
VOSviewer  (van Eck and Waltma n, 2010) . Publications can be uploaded from large 
publication  databases -such as the Web of Science or Scopus - into the VO Sviewer system on 
the basis of their full database records including author - and d atabase -given terms 
(keywords). The VOSviewer  algorithm calculates how many co -occurrence links there are in 
the uploaded set of publications , the strength of the links (number of publications in which 
two terms occur together)  and the total link strength.  The terms and their links constitute 
the bib liometric network. In addition, terms with a high link strength are grouped into 
clusters. The matrix of term co -occurrence frequencies serves as input for t he VOS viewer  
mapping technique . This technique determines for each term a location in a two -dimensi onal 
space. Strongly related terms tend to be located close to each other in the two -dimensional 
space, whereas terms that do not have a strong relation are located further away from each 
other. For brevity we will use in the remainder of this paper ‚Äòterm map‚Äô instead of term -
occurrence map. The VOS viewer  mapping technique is related to multidimensional scaling, 
but for the purpose of creating term maps it has been shown to yield more satisfactory 
results.  The VOSviewer clustering technique is  a modularity -based community detection 
procedure  which is discussed in detail by Van Eck et al. (2010), Waltman et al. (2010), 
Waltman and Van Eck (2013).   
It is possible to set a threshold value for the minimum number of term occurrence s. We can 
use this threshold parameter to specify the minimum number of occurrences that a term 
must have within the set of publications to be includ ed in a term map. We experiment with 
different occurrence threshold s, beginning with threshold value ÔÅß=1, i.e., all terms identified 
in the set of publications are taken into account in the construction of the network , and 
further threshold values up to ÔÅß=10. Thus, the occurrence threshold determines the diversity 
of terms : at a low threshold most or all of  the terms are included in the network formation, 
whereas at a high threshold only the more frequently  occurring  terms are included .  
As mentioned above , the VOS viewer methodology also includes a technique in which terms 
with relatively high co -occurrence links are grouped into a cluster. What is the meaning of 
these clusters in the context of our simulation  of cities ? As discussed previously, the terms in 
the network correspond to  the abilities and capacities of the inhabitants  and the co -
occurrences are the connections between these abilities and capacities. This will give rise to 
organizations and institutions in the educational, research, business, cultural and social  
sectors, which become visible as clusters in the network . In this sense, the number of 
clusters is a measure of complexity within the network. We may expect a relation between 
diversity (value of occurrence threshold) and complexity  (number of clusters). In Section 3 
we will see that our analyses indeed show a relation between the occurrence threshold and 
the number of clusters.

 2.3 Network Data  and Network Parameters  
We collect from the Web of Science (WoS) all 7,653 publications of Leiden University 
published in 2022. Leiden University is a research intensive university, oldest in the 
Netherlands (founded 1575), 34,000 students, invariably in the top -100 worldwide of the 
international rankings, 15 Nobel Laureates affiliated to the university  (Leiden University 
2023) . The full records of the Leiden publications including author - and database -given 
terms (keywords) are uploaded in the VOSviewer. All 7,653 publications are put in 
alphabetic order on the basis of the name of the first author. We assume that this assures a 
random composition of the set of publications as far as th e subjects of research (and with  
that the relevant terms) concerns. The occurrence frequency of terms may differ 
substantially for the various terms. Some terms occur only  in one or a few  publication s 
(these publication s relate to a  very specific topic  such as supermassive black holes) , and 
other terms occur in many publications ( often these publications deal with important ad 
general topics in medical research , for instanc e cancer or quality -of-life).  
A representative sample of 7,653 is 366 (confidence level 95% and margin of error 5%) so 
we start with alphabetically the first 400 Leiden publications and successively double the 
number: 800, 1,600, 3,200 and so on. As a che ck we also take the first 1,000, and then 
2,000, 3,000 up to 7,000 publications. In this way, we let the network grow: we have 
enlarged the network structure from 400 to 7,000, an enlargement of nearly a factor 20.  
To give an impression of the visualizati on of the Leiden publications by the VoS viewer 
mapping procedure we show in Figure  2 the term map representing the network for the 
(alphabetically) first 6,000 publications with occurrence threshold ÔÅß=4 (we take a higher 
occurrence threshold in order to avoid overloading the map with a very large amount of 
terms, we now have in total 2,222 terms). We see a large medical research cluster (left 
side) and an astronomy and astrophysics cluster (right side). In the network maps the 
different clusters are indicate d with different colors, the size of the circle of a term is 
determined by its weight, i.e., the number of publications in which this term occurs . For 
details of the network and mapping procedures we ref er to the VOSviewer manual (van Eck 
and Waltman 2020).    8

3.  Results and Discussion  
3.1 Network p arameters at different occurrence t hresholds for a growing 
network  
For each network structure the VoSviewer calculates four parameters: the number of terms 
involved in the construction of the network, the number of clusters, the number of links , and 
the total strength of the links. These are our network parameters of which we want to find 
the dependence on the size of the network. We perform these calculations for occurrence 
thresholds ÔÅß=1 to 10.  
In Figure  3 we show our results for occurrence thre sholds ÔÅß=1, 2, and 3 ; the results for ÔÅß= 1 
up to 10 are presented in the Supplementary Material  Table S1 . We find for our  four network 
parameters pi  (total link strength p1, number of links p2, number of terms p3, number of 
clusters p4) a significant power law dependence on network size, so we can write  
                                                                                
ùëùùëñ,ÔÅß (ùëõ )= B(i,ÔÅß).ùëõ ùõΩ(ùëñ,ÔÅß)        (2) 
9 
 Where ùëùùëñ,ÔÅß  is network parameter i at term occurrence threshold  ÔÅß,  ùëõ is the size of the 
network , B(i,ÔÅß) is the empirically determined equation coefficient  for network parameter  ùëùùëñ,ÔÅß  
at term occurrence threshold  ÔÅß, and Œ≤(i,ÔÅß) is the power law exponent empirically determined 
for network parameter  ùëùùëñ,ÔÅß  at term occurrence threshold  ÔÅß. We find in all cases 0‚â§ Œ≤(i,ÔÅß) ‚â§2.5. 
We see that for the lowest occurrence threshold  ÔÅß=1 the total link strength as well as the 
number of links increase slightly super linearly , for the higher occurrence threshold s the 
increase is strongly  superlinear . The number of terms increases for ÔÅß=1 sublinearly  with 
network size, but for the higher occurrence thresholds  super linearly . The number of clusters 
is the only parameter which, regardless of the value of the occurrence threshold, increases 
sublinearly.  We also see that the scaling coefficient B(i,ÔÅß) which determines the absolute 
value of the network parameters, decreases with increa sing occurrence threshold for all 
parameters.  
 
We also performed our calculations after removing those terms that have no or a very small 
link strength (link strength lower than 10; this value is reasonable given the link strength 
distribution of all terms in the network, see Supplementary Material Figure s S1 and  S2). For 
example, in the case of network size 6,000 and ÔÅß=1, 27% of the terms  is removed and that 
leads to 13% less total link strength of the entire network. Generally, for most of the 
network parameters the measured scaling exponents do no t change much  (see 
Supplementary Material Table S1). The scaling exponent for ÔÅß=1 increases from 1.04 to 
1.08. However, what  changes drastically by removing terms with no or a very small link 
strength is the number of clusters. In the case of network size 6,000 and ÔÅß=1, the number of 
clusters decreases from 245 to 88: removing terms with no or a very small link strength 
means t hat many small clusters disappear.  
 
In Section 2. 2 we discussed that the number of clusters can be seen as a measure of 
complexity and that a specific relation with the occurrence threshold can be expected. We 
see in Figure  3 this specific relation: wherea s for the three other network parameters the 
scaling exponent increases with increasing occurrence threshold, the number of clusters is 
the only network parameter of which the scaling exponent decreases with increasing 
occurrence threshold. Interestingly, the number of clusters increase s sublinearly  with 
network size particularly for the lower occurrence thresholds.  This finding is interesting 
because the network clusters can be seen as activity centers and other studies show a 
similar sublinear increase of  activity centres (‚Äòhotspots‚Äô) in cities (Louail et al., 2014; 2015; 
Louf and Bathelemy, 2013; 2014b; 2016). Particularly with occurrence thresholds above 2, 
the number of clusters hardly increases with increasing size. This suggests that in a growing 
network the complexity does increase but not ‚Äòexplode‚Äô and this in turn may  be an indication  
that a growing network tend to decrease complexity, which  may be a sign  of effective self -
organization. F urther research , however,  is necessary to rule  out effects of the VOS viewer 
clustering algorithm  at a higher number of publications.  10

occurrence threshold s ÔÅß=1 (upper panel), 2  (middle panel) , and 3 (lower panel).  
11 
 To the best of our knowledge, the only empirical work on the increase of the number of links 
for a growing network is the study of Li and Lu (2009)  and Li (2009). These authors find 
values between 1.12 and 1.31 which is close to our values , see Supplement ary Material  
Section 3.   
 
3.2  Influence of term occurrence and of occurrence threshold  
Our measurement s on the growing network as presented in Figure  3 are performed with  
specific  occurrence threshold s ÔÅß, for instance ÔÅß=1 means all terms with occurrence 1 and 
higher are included. It is interesting to find out how specific occurrence values play a role in 
the structure of the network. In the Supplementary Material Figure  S3 we present the 
relation between  the number of terms and the occurrence of a term, and the relation 
sbetween the occurrence of a term and its link strength in the network. We see that the 
number of terms decreases as a function of occurrence with a power law exponent -2.33. On 
the other h and, the higher the occurrence of a term, the larger its link strength in the 
network, with a linear relation . Thus, the higher the occurrence of a term, the lower the 
number of these terms, but the larger its contribution to the total li nk strength of the  
network.   
In the previous section  we discussed the dependence of the network parameters on network 
size for different occurrence thresholds. We now analyze the data as a function of the 
occurrence threshold. With the data used in Figure  3 we can analyze the relation between 
the scaling exponents and the occurrence threshold more explicitly. The results are 
presented in Figure  4. We find that the higher the term occurrence threshold, i.e., the more 
common terms are involved, the higher the power law exponents, except for the number of 
clusters.

parameters.

 Figure 4 shows the  relatively large difference  between the scaling exponent for ÔÅß=1 and the 
scaling exponents for the higher occurrence thresholds . This has an interesting consequence. 
In the case of small networks, the total link  strength is the largest for ÔÅß=1 (high est term 
diversity) . But if the network become s large r then, notwithstanding its  small scaling 
coefficient , the total link strength  for ÔÅß =5 (which means a lower term diversity)  will exceed 
the total link strength for ÔÅß =1 because of its high scaling exponent. It can be easily show n 
by equating the scaling equations for ÔÅß =1 and 5 that this will happen around n=25,000 . This 
would imply that for very large networks term  diversity plays a declining role in the total link 
strength.   
With the results shown  in Figure 4 we can analyze the relation between the scaling 
exponents and the occurrence threshold more explicitly. We find that the higher the term 
occurrence threshold, i.e., the more common terms are involved, the higher the power law 
exponents, except for the num ber of clusters, and this relation is with high significance

where the coefficient a(i)  is positive for the number of terms , the number of links , and the 
total link strength, and negative for the number of clusters , and the intersection b(i) is 
around 1.0 for the number of terms , the number of links, and the total link strength, and 
around 0.3 for the number of clusters.  Inserting Eq.3 into Eq.2 yields 
ùëùùëñ,ÔÅß (ùëõ )= B(i,ÔÅß).ùëõ ùõΩ(ùëñ,ÔÅß) ~ B(i,ÔÅß).ùëõ[ùëé(ùëñ)ùëôùëõÔÅß +ùëè(ùëñ)] = B(i,ÔÅß).ùëõùëé(ùëñ)ùëè(ùëñ)ùëõùëé(ùëñ)ùëôùëõÔÅß   (4)  
This means that the scaling behavior of our university network is in fact dictated by the 
occurrence threshold , i.e., by the extent a specific term is present (total number of 
occurrences) in the set of publications. In the following section we discuss the relevance of 
our findings for urban scaling research.  
 
3.2 Discussion of the findings in the context of city simulation  
Increasing the term occurrence threshold means increasing the minimum number of 
publications in which a term must occur, which implies that the selection of terms relates 
more and more to the frequent terms, i.e., to research on current topics. Taking the lowest 
threshold, ÔÅß=1, i.e., all terms are included, ensures that also less actual topics will be 
included in the network structure. Particularly less actual topics may represent new, 
unexpected and original research. In the context of an  urban community, this relates to rare 
abilities and qualities within the population. Shutters et al. (2018) find that t he increase in 
the total network interconnectivity  is for an important part driven by the presence of rare, 
but highly interdependent occupations in a cit y. 
The choice of the occurrence threshold is a choice of diversity. From our observations follows 
that the occurrence threshold  not only determines the total number of terms in the network 
but also the number of clusters: the higher the occurrence threshol d (less term diversity) , 
the less the number of clusters increases with increasing network size, whereas the total link 13 
 strength of the network increases with a high superlinear scaling exponent. This could 
indicate  that in a growing network the terms with  a high occurrence (occurrence higher than 
1) lead to a decrease of the complexity of the network measured in number of clusters .  
 
What are the characteristics of our network  clusters  and how do this relates to cities ? We 
can investigate this by looking at the clusters in Figure  2. The clusters  are broad common 
focus areas that more or less  remain the same as the size of the network increases , mostly 
corresponding to  large fields of research . In the Leiden network stru cture we see large 
medical and astrophysical clusters, and particularly the medical clusters are characterized by 
general terms with a high fr equency, such as ‚Äòbehavior‚Äô, ‚Äòsurvival‚Äô, ‚Äòrisk‚Äô, ‚Äòmanagement‚Äô, 
‚Äòmortality‚Äô, ‚Äòchildren‚Äô. For lower term occurrence thresholds also more s pecific, smaller 
clusters become visible such as dna-expression, aging and dementia,  stellar evolution and 
black holes. This fits well with the idea of the city: there are a more of less fixed number of 
problems/areas of attention tha t arise in each city, and some cities have a special cluster s 
such as a port, or a specific  industry , or a university.  The clusters represent activity centers 
and we find that they scale sublinearly with increasing ertwork size. We here see a similarity 
with the  work on spatial structure of mobility networks in cities (Louail et al., 2014; 2015; 
Louf and Bathelemy, 2013; 2014b; 2016). These authors find that the number of hotspots 
(urban activity centres) scales sublinearly with city population size and the y remark that this 
finding may serve as a guide for constructing a theoretical model.  
 
4.  Conclusions  
In this paper we make an attempt to increase our understanding of the urban scaling 
phenomenon. In our approach we simulate a city by a set of publications from a large 
university where the publications take the role of city inhabitants and the terms (keyw ords) 
in the p ublications represent abilities and  qualities of the inhabitants. We use in this 
experiment scientific publications that are connected by co -occurrence of terms to create a 
network on the basis of these connections, and let this network grow by successively adding 
publications. We analyze how four important network parameter s, namely number of terms, 
number of clusters, number of links, and total links strength increase with increasing size of 
the network. This procedure is performed for diffe rent values of the term occurrence 
threshold.  This occurrence threshold determines the diversity of terms : at a low threshold 
most or all of the terms are included in the network formation, whereas at a high threshold 
only the more common, i.e., the more frequently occurring terms are included.  
We find a significant power law dependence  of these network parameters on network size.  
We remark that the network grows with the number of publications, but the network itself is 
a structure of interconnected terms . This is similar to what we want to simulate: the size of 
cities is determined by the number of inhabitants, whereas the real basis of the urban 
scaling phenomenon is the network of interactions between all possible abilities and qualities 
of these inhabi tants. The size of a city therefore is a kind of an easy measurable, proxy 
independent variable. Publications take a similar role in our simulation.   
The larger the network (with respect to number publications), the larger the number of 
clusters, but inter estingly this number of clusters is the only network parameter that 14 
 increases sublinearly (exponent Œ≤ < 1) with increasing size of the network. This could be  an 
indication that a growing network tend s to decrease complexity by effective self -
organization. Professional diversity is an important element for the socioeconomic strength 
of cities ( Bettencourt et al., 2014). In our approach  the number of clusters can be 
interpreted as  a measure of complexity within the network. Since  the occurrence threshold 
determines the diversity of terms, we may expect a relation with network complexity, and 
thus a relation between the occurrence threshold and the number of clusters. This is indeed 
the case: whereas for the three other network par ameters the superlinear scaling exponent 
increases with increasing occurrence threshold, the number of clusters is the only network 
parameter of which the sublinear scaling exponent decreases with increasing occurrence 
threshold. The sublinear scaling of t he number of clusters shows  a similarity with work on 
the sublinear scaling of urban activity centers .  
If we assume that all terms, but particularly the rare terms, i.e., those with a low  occurrence 
frequency are important for the structure of the network, then the networks with a low 
occurrence frequency  are the most appropriate simulation of the urban complex system and 
the scaling of this system. Particularly the number of network links  and the total network 
linkage strength are in our opinion the parameters that dominate the scaling phenomenon 
and can be considered as a simulation of the economic strength of a city, i.e., its gross 
urban product. The measured  power law dependence of the se network parameters on 
network size, and particularly  the power law exponents are within the range that is typical 
for urban scaling.  
A low occurrence threshold means a high diversity of terms. We find that highest total link 
strength for the lowest occu rrence threshold. In other words, the more diversity of terms, 
the stronger the network structure. The phenomenon in cities that may correspond to these 
observations is that at a high diversity of abilities and capacities, the larger the city the 
stronger it socio -economically is, and that this socio -economic strength increases slightly 
superlinear. Another important finding is that the higher the occurrence  threshold , the 
stronger the power law of the number of links and the total link strength  increases . In the 
context of an urban community this finding is intuitively understandable: the more a specific , 
strongly present  ability o r quality is present in the urban population  (in our simulation higher 
Œ≥), the faster the number of links related to that ability will grow for an increasing 
population. For relatively rare abilities within the urban population  (in our simulation low Œ≥), 
however important these may be, one can expect that the number of links will grow less fast 
for an increasing population. We conclude with the key finding if this s tudy: i f our simulation 
model is an appropriate approach to understand urban scaling, the scaling exponent is 
strongly related to the presence of common but in particular also rare abilities and qualities 
in the urb an population.

 Supplementary Material  
 
1. Network parameters for term occurrence thresholds 1 to 10  
For each size of our network structure we calculated with the VoSviewer  four parameters: 
the number of terms involved in the construction of the network, the number of clusters, the 
number of links, and the total strength of the links. These are our network parameters of 
which we want to find the dependence on the size of the  network (i.e., number of 
publications with which the network is constructed). We perform these calculations for 
occurrence thresholds ÔÅß=1 to  10. We also performed our calculations after removing those 
terms that have a link strength <10 (this value is cho sen on the basis of the link strength 
distribution function, see Figure S3.  In Table S1 we show our results  for the measured 
scaling exponents.

the exponents are measured with excluding terms with link strength <10.

2. Distribution of link strengths over the terms  
There can be a link between any pair of terms. Each link has a specific strength, this 
strength indicates the number of publications in which two terms occur together. Because a 
term can be linked to many other terms, we can sum the specific strengths of a ll links for 
any term. The VOSviewer allows the calculation of this summed link strength per term. The 
total of the summed link strengths of all terms is the total link strength of the network as 
discussed in the main text . 
As an example of the distribution of link strengths we show in Figure  S1 the rank distribution 
of the (summed) link strength of the first 100 terms for ÔÅß=1 at n=3000 and 6000 .  22

with ÔÅß=1 at n=3000 and 6000.  
 
Remarkably, the distributions are quite similar for both network sizes, particularly the power 
law dependence. The distribution function has the form                                               
 ùëÜùëõ,ÔÅß (ùëü )= C(n,ÔÅß).ùëü ‚àíùõº(ùëõ,ÔÅß)         (S1) 
where ùëÜùëÅ,ÔÅß (ùëü ) is the link strength for a term with rank ùëü in a network with size n  and 
occurrence threshold ÔÅß ; C(n,ÔÅß) is the coefficient of the distribution function and -Œ±(n,ÔÅß) is the 
exponent -0.45. This rank distribution resembles a Zipf -distribution (Newman , 2005; Ribeiro 
et al., 2021). The coefficients however differ, which is obvious as these coefficients are 
related to the total link strength of the network. We can transfo rm the rank distribution in 
Eq.S1 into a link strength distribution. To keep eq. S1 simple,  we write : 
ùëÜ (ùëü )= C.ùëü ‚àíùõº           (S1a) 
The number of link strengths between ùëÜ1 (ùëü1  ) and ùëÜ2 (ùëü2  ) is obviously  ùëü2 ‚àíùëü1 and thus the 
number of link strengths n(ùëÜ) satisfies  n(ùëÜ)ùëëùëÜ = -dr   so that  
n(ùëÜ)= ‚àí-dr/ ùëëùëÜ  ~ S ‚Äì(1+Œ±)/Œ±           (S2) 
which means in our case a link strength distribution of about S ‚Äì2.54  which suggests a scale -
free distribution of  link strengths over the terms in our networks. This is a similar situation 
as the work mentioned in the main text on increase of the number of links for a growing 
network  (Li and Lu, 2009; Li, 2009) where also a scale -free network was used.  
We see in Fig ure S1 that the distribution has no typical threshold value within this ranking 
range. In Figure  S2 we show the entire rank -link strength distribution function for all terms  
for the network with ÔÅß=1 at n= 6000. We see a threshold around the summed link str ength 
value 10 .

3. Increase of number of links  
To the best of our knowledge, the only empirical work on the increase of the number of links 
for a growing network is the study of Li and Lu (2009) and Li (2009). These authors find that 
the number of links (in their study denoted with  L, in our study p2) increases with L ~ m1+Œ∏ 
with 0‚â§ Œ∏ ‚â§1. They measure, however, the number of links as s function of the number of 
nodes m, whereas we measure the number of links as a function of network size, i.e., 
number of publications ùëõ. With the data in Figure 3 in the main text it is easy to find out how 
the number of links increases with the number of terms, which are the nodes in our network. 
The mathematical derivation of this relation is given here below. We find for ÔÅß =1 a power 
law dependence with exponent 1.21. Li and Lu find  for 1+ Œ∏ values between 1.12 and 1.31 
which is close to our values .  
 
We specify Eq.2 in the main text for number of links p2, and the number of terms p3: 
ùëù2,ÔÅß (ùëõ )= B(2,ÔÅß).ùëõ ùõΩ(2,ÔÅß)         (1a) 
ùëù3,ÔÅß (ùëõ )=  B(3,ÔÅß).ùëõ ùõΩ(3,ÔÅß)          (1b) 
Exponentiating both sides of Eq. 1b with ùõΩ(2,ÔÅß)/ùõΩ(3,ÔÅß) yields  
ùëù3,ÔÅß (ùëõ) ùõΩ(2,ÔÅß)
ùõΩ(3,ÔÅß)=  ùêµ(3,ÔÅß) ùõΩ(2,ÔÅß)
ùõΩ(3,ÔÅß). ùëõ ùõΩ(2,ÔÅß)        (1c) 
hence  
ùëõ ùõΩ(2,ÔÅß)=ùëù3,ÔÅß (ùëõ) ùõΩ(2,ÔÅß)
ùõΩ(3,ÔÅß)  / ùêµ(3,ÔÅß) ùõΩ(2,ÔÅß)
ùõΩ(3,ÔÅß)        (1d) 
Inserting the right side of Eq. 1d into Eq. 1a gives  
1101001,00010,000

ùõΩ(3,ÔÅß)].ùëù3,ÔÅß (ùëõ) ùõΩ(2,ÔÅß)
ùõΩ(3,ÔÅß)        (1e) 
which means that the number of links (at a given number of publications n) is related to the 
number of terms by a power law with an exponent equal to the ratio ùõΩ(2,ÔÅß)
ùõΩ(3,ÔÅß). 
 
4. Influence of term occurrence and of occurrence threshold  
It is interesting to find out how specific occurrence values play a role in the structure of the 
network. In Figure S3 we present the relation between the number of terms and the 
occurrence of a te rm, and the relation between the occurrence of a term and its link strength 
in the network. We see that the number of terms decreases as a function of occurrence with 
a power law exponent -2.33. On the other hand, the higher the occurrence of a term, the 
larger its link strength in the network, with a linear relation. Thus, the higher the occurrence 
of a term, the lower the number of these terms, but the larger its contribution to the total 
link strength of the network.

and the relation between occurrence of a term and its link strength in the network (lower
