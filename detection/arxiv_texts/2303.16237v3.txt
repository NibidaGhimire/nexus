Abstract
For a graph G, a vertex coloring fis called nonrepetitive if for all k∈Nand
allP2k=⟨v1,···, vk, vk+1,···, v2k⟩(path of 2 kvertices) in G, there must be some
1≤i≤ksuch that f(vi)̸=f(vk+i).
We use π(G) to denote the minimum number of colors required for Gto be non-
repetitively colored.
In 1906, Thue proved that π(Pn)≤3 for all n. In this paper, we focus on grids,
which are the Cartesian products of paths. We prove that 5 ≤π(Pn□Pn)≤12 for
sufficiently large n, where the previous best lower bound was 4 and upper bound was 16.
Moreover, we also discuss nonrepetitive coloring of the Cartesian product of complete
graphs.
1 Introduction
First, we standardize the notation used in this paper. We use the uppercase letters A,B,
C,D,X,Y,Z,Wand the lowercase letters a,b,c,d,x,y,z,wto denote colors, the
lowercase letter fto denote a coloring function of a graph, the uppercase letter Fto denote
a function defined on integers, the uppercase letter Pto denote a path, the uppercase letter
Wto denote a walk or lazy walk, and the lowercase letters uandvto denote vertices of a
graph (notations may have superscripts or subscripts). In section 4, we use positive integers
to denote colors.
In this paper, a gird is the Cartesian product of two paths. For each integer s≥2, an
s-dimensional grid is the Cartesian product of spaths.
Definition 1.1. LetGbe a graph. Suppose fis a vertex coloring of G,kis a positive
integer and P2k=⟨v1,···, vk, vk+1,···, v2k⟩is a path of 2kvertices in G. Then, we say that
frepetitively colors P2kif for all 1≤i≤k, f(vi) =f(vk+i). If no even-vertex path of Gis
repetitively colored by f, then we say that fis a (path-)nonrepetitive coloring of G. We use
1arXiv:2303.16237v3  [math.CO]  19 Aug 2024π(G)to denote the minimum number of colors required for Gto be nonrepetitively colored,
which is referred to as the nonrepetitive chromatic number of G.
It is easy to see that a nonrepetitive coloring is a proper coloring.
The origin of studying nonrepetitive coloring can be traced back to the theorem proven
by Thue in 1906, with a notable new proof provided by Leech in 1957, which is stated as
follows:
Theorem 1.2 ([18, 20]) .π(Pn) = 3 for all n≥4.
For each n∈N, we define a function FP,n: [n]→ {a, b, c}such that when each vertex
viin a path Pn=⟨v1,···, vn⟩receive the color FP,n(i),Pnis nonrepetitively colored. The
function FP,nexists due to the above theorem.
Figure 1 provides an example of a nonrepetitive coloring of a path.

The concept of nonrepetitive coloring of general graphs was introduced by Alon et al.[1]
in 2002. In this paper, they proved that π(G) =O(∆2) where ∆ is the maximum degree
ofG. Several authors subsequently improved this result, see [10, 13, 15, 16, 19]. In 2020,
Wood et al.[9, 11, 17] proved π(G)≤768 if Gis a planar graph. Additionally, there are
some related work in [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21].
In [9], the core method is proving that planar graphs can be embedded into some product
structure of several graph classes with bounded nonrepetitive chromatic number, which is
also one of the motivations for studying grids in this paper.
We now define the two types of products that will be used in this paper.
Definition 1.3. Given graphs G1andG2, the Cartesian product of G1andG2, denoted by
G1□G2, is the graph with vertex set V(G1)×V(G2), where (v1, v2)and(v′
1, v′
2)are adjacent
ifv1=v′
1andv2v′
2∈E(G2)orv2=v′
2andv1v′
1∈E(G1); Similarly, the strong product of
G1andG2, denoted by G1⊠G2, is the graph with vertex set V(G1)×V(G2), where (v1, v2)
and(v′
1, v′
2)are adjacent if (v1, v2)and(v′
1, v′
2)are adjacent in G1□G2, orv1v′
1∈E(G1)and
v2v′
2∈E(G2).
It is easy to see that G1□G2is a subgraph of G1⊠G2.
For our approach, we need to introduce the following concepts:
Definition 1.4. Fork∈N, a walk W2k=⟨v1,···, vk, vk+1,···, v2k⟩is boring if vi=vk+i
for all 1≤i≤k.
LetGbe a graph, and let fbe a vertex coloring of G. We say fis walk-nonrepetitive
if for all k, every repetitively colored walk W2kis boring. That is, f(vi) =f(vk+i)for all i
implies vi=vk+ifor all i.
We use σ(G)to denote the minimum number of colors required for Gto be walk-nonrepetitively
colored.
2Note that a path is always a walk, so π(G)≤σ(G).
Definition 1.5. A lazy walk in a graph Gis a walk in the pseudograph obtained from Gby
adding a loop at each vertex. In other words, in a lazy walk, two consecutive vertices may be
the same.
We can also define the concept of lazy walk-nonrepetitive coloring. However, it is easy
to check this is an equivalent concept to walk-nonrepetitive coloring. In other words, if fis
a walk-nonrepetitive coloring of G, then each repetitively colored lazy walk is boring.
Now, we make a simple observation. In a walk-nonrepetitive coloring of G, for each
v∈V(G) and two neighbors u1, u2ofv,u1andu2must have different colors. So it is easy
to check that σ(P6)>3.
Theorem 1.6 ([4, 17]) .σ(Pn) = 4 for all n≥6.
Proof. LetFP,n: [n]→ {a, b, c}be the function in Theorem 1.2, we now define a function
fW,n: [n]→ {a, b, c, d }as follows:
FW,n(i) =d, i ≡0 (mod 3) ,
FP,n(i− ⌊i
3⌋), i̸≡0 (mod 3) .
For a path Pn=⟨v1,···, vn⟩, letf(vi) =FW,n(i), then fis a walk-nonrepetitive coloring
ofPn.
Figure 2 provides an example of a walk-nonrepetitive coloring of a path.
Figure 2
Proposition 1.7 ([2]).(i)IfG′is a subgraph of G, then π(G′)≤π(G),σ(G′)≤σ(G);
(ii)LetG1andG2be graphs, then σ(G1⊠G2)≤σ(G1)σ(G2).
Proof. (i) It is obvious.
(ii) Let f1andf2be walk-nonrepetitive coloring on G1andG2, respectively. We define
the following product coloring f = (f1, f2) onG1⊠G2:
f((v1, v2)) = ( f1(v1), f2(v2)).
It is not difficult to verify that fis a walk-nonrepetitive coloring of G1⊠G2. The details of
the proof can be found in [2] or [21].
Corollary 1.8 ([17]).For all n,π(Pn□Pn)≤σ(Pn□Pn)≤σ(Pn⊠Pn)≤σ(Pn)2≤16.
3Figure 3
 Figure 4
Figure 3 is an example of a nonrepetitive 16-coloring of a grid.
We now consider a natural question. Suppose we assign a product coloring f= (f1, f2)
to a grid, where f1is a nonrepetitive 3-coloring of a path, and f2is a walk-nonrepetitive
4-coloring of a path. Then, is fa nonrepetitive coloring of the grid? Unfortunately, this is
incorrect. Figure 4 provides a counterexample, where the repetitive path is highlighted in
red. Furthermore, regardless of how a nonrepetitive 3-coloring is designed, there will always
exist repetitive strolls , where a walk ⟨v1,···.vk, vk+1,···, v2k⟩is called a stroll if vi̸=vk+i
for all 1 ≤i≤k, which indicates that when studying nonrepetitive colorings of grid, product
colorings do not yield results better than using 16 colors (see Proposition 3.3 of [21]).
In Section 2, we give a coloring to show that π(Pn□Pn)≤12. In Section 3, we show
that π(Pn□Pn)≥5. In Section 4, we conduct some explorations into the nonrepetitive
colorings of Cartesian products of complete graphs. Finally, in Section 5, we pose some open
questions.
42 Upper bound
Definition 2.1. Label the vertices of the grid Pn□Pnsequentially from v(1,1)tov(n,n), where
v(i,j)∼v(i′,j′)if and only if i=i′and|j−j′|= 1 orj=j′and|i−i′|= 1. Define the
location function l1, l2:V(Pn□Pn)→[n]as follows:
l1(v(i,j)) =i, l 2(v(i,j)) =j.
For2≤r≤2n, we call the set Lr={v∈V(Pn□Pn) :l1(v) +l2(v) =r}a left line.
For1−n≤r≤n−1, we call the set Rr={v∈V(Pn□Pn) :l1(v)−l2(v) =r}a right
line.
Lemma 2.2. Letm≥2n. Using the notations in Definition 2.1 and the proof of Theorem
1.6, we construct a vertex coloring fofPn□Pnas follows: For all 2≤r≤2n, letf(v) =
FW,m(r)ifv∈Lr(Figure 5). Then every repetitive lazy walk W2k=⟨v1,···, vk, vk+1,···, v2k⟩
satisfies that v1andvk+1are on the same left line, where kis an arbitrary positive integer.
Proof. Construct a path Pas follows: V(P) ={Lr: 2≤r≤2n}, and Lr∼Lr+1for all r.
In other words, Pis obtained by contracting each left line of Pn□Pninto a single vertex. P
inherits a walk-nonrepetitive coloring. W2kcorresponds to a repetitive lazy walk in P, hence
it is boring. As a result, v1andvk+1lie on the same left line in Pn□Pn.
Figure 5
 Figure 6
Definition 2.3. For a graph Gand a positive integer s, define the distance- sgraph Gsas
follows: V(Gs) =V(G), and u∼vinGsif the distance between uandvinGis exactly s.
Theorem 2.4. π(Pn□Pn)≤12for all n.
5Proof. Letmbe a sufficiently large positive integer. Consider f(1)
W,m: [m]→ {a, b, c, d }and
f(2)
W,m: [m]→ {x, y, z, w }in the proof of Theorem 1.6. We define a coloring f0ofPn□Pnas
follows:
f0(v) =(
f(1)
W,m(r
2), v ∈Lr, r≡0 (mod 2) ,
f(2)
W,m(⌊r+n+1
2⌋), v∈Rr, r̸≡0 (mod 2) .
Figure 6 is a schematic diagram of f0. We can observe that f0is not a nonrepetitive
coloring, as there exists a repetitive path of 4 vertices in the red range. Our goal is to prove
that if we can destroy all repetitive 4-paths like this, then there will be no more repetitive
paths in the graph.
For all k, letP2k=⟨v1,···, vk, vk+1,···, v2k⟩be a repetitive path in Pn□Pnunder the
coloring f0. It is easy to see that kmust be even. Let
Podd={v1, v3,···, vk−1, vk+1, vk+3,···, v2k−1},
Peven={v2, v4,···, vk, vk+2, vk+4,···, v2k}.
Without loss of generality, we assume that l1(v1) +l2(v1) is even, which indicates that the
colors of vertices in Poddare chosen from {a, b, c, d }, and the colors of vertices in Pevenare
chosen from {x, y, z, w }. Note that PoddandPevenare both repetitive lazy walks in ( Pn□Pn)2.
By Lemma 2.2, v1andvk+1are in the same left line, v2andvk+2are in the same right line.
This indicates that v1∼vk+2andv2∼vk+1(Figure 7).
Figure 7
 Figure 8
6We now divide colors x, y, z, w intox1, x2, y1, y2, z1, z2, w1, w2by parity of l1. Let
f(v) =

f0(v), iff0(v)∈ {a, b, c, d },
x1, y1, z1, w1,iff0(v) =x, y, z, w respectively, l1(v) is odd ,
x2, y2, z2, w2,iff0(v) =x, y, z, w respectively, l1(v) is even .
Then fis a nonrepetitive coloring of Pn□Pnusing 12 colors (Figure 8).
Next, we briefly talk about the high-dimensional case, which is fundamentally similar to
the 2-dimension approach, but with certain distinctions in the details.
Theorem 2.5. π(Pn□Pn□Pn)≤28for all n.
Proof. Letmbe a sufficiently large positive integer. Consider f(1)
W,m: [m]→ {a, b, c, d },
f(2)
W,m: [m]→ {x, y, z, w }andf(3)
W,m: [m]→ {X, Y, Z, W }in the proof of Theorem 1.6. Just
like in Definition 2.1, we label the vertices of Pn□Pn□Pnsequentially from v(1,1,1)tov(n,n,n ),
and define the location function l1,l2andl3.
We call the set Hr={v∈V((Pn□Pn□Pn) :l1(v) +l2(v) +l3(v) =r}aleft plane .
Note that every left plane is an independent set. For all fixed vertex v0, we call the set
Lv0={v∈V(Pn□Pn□Pn) :l1(v)−l1(v0) =l2(v)−l2(v0) =l3(v)−l3(v0)}aright line
passing through v0.
Based on the parity of the index r=l1(v) +l2(v) +l3(v), we classify the vertices vof
graph Pn□Pn□Pninto two types. We then define a coloring f0ofPn□Pn□Pnas follows:
Ifl1(v) +l2(v) +l3(v) =ris odd, then we let f0(v) =f(1)
W,m(r). Note that all vertices on
each left plane of odd rshare the same color.
Ifl1(v) +l2(v) +l3(v) =ris even, then we apply a 16-coloring scheme to ensure that all
vertices lying on each given right line are assigned a common color. Below are the details of
this coloring scheme.
We consider an arbitrary right plane H=Hr. Let H2be the induced subgraph of V(H)
in (Pn□Pn□Pn)2, then H2is aregular triangular tiling graph (Figure 9) of some size,
which is a subgraph of Pm⊠Pm.
Figure 9
So we can utilize product coloring ( f2, f3) to provide a walk-nonrepetitive 16-coloring for
Pm⊠Pm, and H2inherits this coloring. Since mis sufficiently large, we can translate the
7coloring pattern along the direction of right lines to ensure that each left plane with an even
index rhas a 16-coloring that is walk-nonrepetitive on its distance-2 graph, and each right
line intersects all left planes with even indices rat vertices of the same color. (See Figure
10. The dashed lines indicate the edges in the distance-2 graph.)
Figure 10
 Figure 11
Like the proof of Theorem 2.4, all repetitive paths under coloring f0can be ‘confined’
within a small region (the red edges in Figure 10). By dividing the colors a, b, c, d intoai, bi,
ci, di, i= 1,2,3, we destroy all repetitive paths (Figure 11). At this point, the total number
of colors we use is 16 + 3 ×4 = 28.
Why don’t we study the higher-dimensional cases? In fact, our method cannot yield
better results in grids with high dimensions. When constructing a nonrepetitive coloring of an
s-dimensional grid, we need to utilize a walk-nonrepetitive coloring for an ( s−1)-dimensional
grid, which requires 4s−1colors. However, the maximum degree of an s-dimensional grid is
2s−2. In [1], Alon et al. proved that π(G) =O(∆2) where ∆ denotes the maximum degree
ofG. This bound is superior for high-dimensional grids.
83 Lower bound
Since C10is a subgraph of Pn□Pnandπ(C10) = 4 (see [8] or [21]), it follows that π(Pn□Pn)≥
4 for large n. In this section we prove that π(Pn□Pn)≥5 for large n.
For the sake of convenience, we express the (partial) coloring of the grid in the form of a
matrix. For a grid Pm□Pnwith a coloring, the ( i, j) element of the corresponding matrix is
the color of the vertex v(i,j). For instance, the corresponding matrix of the coloring in Figure
12 is

a c
d b
a
.
Figure 12
Theorem 3.1. π(Pn□Pn)≥5for large n.
Proof. Letnbe a sufficiently large positive integer. Suppose Pn□Pnhas a nonrepetitive
4-coloring f:V(Pn□Pn)→ {a, b, c, d }. We proceed to construct a contradiction in three
steps as follows.
Note that we only have 4 colors available to use. When a local coloring is determined,
in order to ensure that no repetitive path occurs, it can be deduced that certain vertices
around it must be of certain colors. We use long right arrows between matrices to represent
such deductions. For example, the following notation means that when the local coloring is
described by the matrix on the left, the color of the vertex at the bottom left corner can
only be c.

a
a d
b
−→
a
a d
c b
.
Step 1. There must be some C4(as a subgraph of Pn□Pn) that uses only 3 colors.
If every C4uses 4 colors, we only need to discuss the following two cases:
(1.1).
a
a b
d c
−→
c a
a b d
d c
−→
d c a

.
9The exclamation mark (!) indicates that regardless of which color is placed in this position,
it will either result in a repetitive path or contradict the assumption.

Now we have proven that there always exists a C4that is colored using only 3 colors.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the coloring pattern of this C4corresponds to
matrix
a b
c a
.
Step 2. The 12 vertices surrounding such a C4cannot be colored with color a, that is,
all elements marked with Xin following matrix cannot be a.

This indicates that the elements marked with Xin the matrix can only be b, c,ord.
Step 3. A simple observation.


.
Based on the fact that π(P5) = 3, we can make a simple observation: among the elements
marked with Yin above matrix, bmust appear. However, to avoid the repetitive path, b
can only be placed in the top-right corner. Therefore, we only need to derive a contradiction
from the following case.


4 The Cartesian product of complete graphs
In Open Problem 3.28 of [21], the nonrepetitive coloring of Kn□Knplays an important role
in studying the edge-nonrepetitive coloring ofKn. Below we give a coloring to prove that
π(Kn□Kn) is at most (1
2+o(1))n2.
Theorem 4.1. For even n≥4, π(Kn□Kn)≤n2
2.
Figure 13
Proof. Label the vertices of Kn□Knsequentially from v(1,1)tov(n,n), where v(i,j)∼v(i′,j′)if
and only if i=i′andj̸=j′orj=j′andi̸=i′. See Figure 13. Each row or each column
induces a complete graph. Now we design a coloring f:V(Kn□Kn)→[n2
2] as follows:
Forj≤n
2, letf(v(i,j)) =n
2(i−1) +j.
Forn
2≤j≤n, we give different coloring schemes based on the parity of i.
When iis odd, let
f(v(i,j)) =f(v(i−1,j−n
2)), i̸= 1;
f(v(n,j−n
2)), i = 1.
When iis even, let
f(v(i,j)) =f(v(i−1,j−n
2−1)), j̸=n
2+ 1;
f(v(i−1,n
2)), j =n
2+ 1.
Then fis a nonrepetitive coloring of Kn□Kn. This verification is straightforward, and we
can illustrate it intuitively with Figure 13. We partition the vertices of the graph into two
distinct perspectives: first, into left and right parts, and second, into blue and yellow types
12(note that blue and yellow here are not colors, but merely labels for types). It is noted that
at this point, for any two disjoint edges, if they have the same starting color and ending color,
respectively, then their vertices must belong to the same type and are located respectively
in the left part and the right part. Consequently, under this coloring, there is no repetitive
path.
As a straightforward corollary, π(Kn□Kn)≤(1
2+o(1))n2when n→ ∞ .
5 Discussions
Question 5.1. LetGbe a regular triangular tiling graph (Figure 9) of any size. Is that
π(G)<16?
The regular triangular tiling graph is a type of graph that lies between Pn□Pnand
Pn⊠Pn, and it is also a planar graph. Research on this question will directly contribute to
the nonrepetitive coloring of planar graphs.
Question 5.2. Is that π(Pn□Pn)>5for large n?
In Section 3, we have proven that π(Pn□Pn)≥5 by analyzing some very small local
structures. Can this approach be further developed or refined? Perhaps computers can help.
Question 5.3. Is there any constant c >0such that π(Kn□Kn)≥cn2?
In the previous text, we have mentioned that π(G) =O(∆2). For the lower bound, Alon
et al. proved in [1] using probabilistic methods that for all ∆, there exists a graph Gwith
maximum degree ∆ such that π(G)≥∆2
log ∆. Since the maximum degree of Kn□Knis 2n−2,
if the answer to Question 5.3 is yes, then we would be able to improve the lower bound to
the same order of magnitude as the upper bound.
