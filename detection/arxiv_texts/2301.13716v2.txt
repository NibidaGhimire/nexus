1 INTRODUCTION
Colliding-wind binaries (CWB) are fascinating systems for study-
ingmassivestars,theirstrongradiation-drivenwinds,shockphysics,
particle acceleration and dust formation. They emit across the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum from radio (Dougherty et al. 2005) to TeV
gamma-rays (H.E.S.S. Collaboration et al. 2020), predominantly
non-thermal emission at the lowest and highest energies (Eichler
& Usov 1993), and thermal radiation from the wind-wind collision
regionatX-rayenergies(Pollock1987;Pollocketal.2021).Hydro-
dynamic models and scaling relations for thermal X-ray emission
were proposed by Luo et al. (1990), who showed that the X-ray lu-
minosity,𝐿x, should scale with orbital separation, 𝑑, as𝐿x∝𝑑−1
foradiabaticshockedwinds.Usov(1992)obtainedanalyticsolutions
for the shape of the shocked region as a function of the properties
of the two winds and derived the expected X-ray radiation. Stevens
etal.(1992)investigatedbothadiabaticandradiativeshockedlayers
andtheirdynamicalinstabilitieswith2Dsimulations,discussingthe
implicationsforX-rayemission.TheX-rayemissionfromsingleand
binary massive stars is reviewed by Rauw (2022).
TheCWBsystems,especiallythosewithcloseoreccentricorbits,
are of great interest. They are not only the progenitors of high-
mass X-ray binaries, but but also of supernovae and compact-object
★E-mail: jmackey@cp.dias.ie (JM)binarysystemsthatcanmergeandbecomegravitationalwave(GW)
sources(e.g.Langeretal.2020).Thecomplexandpoorlyconstrained
post-main sequence evolution of massive stars (Langer 2012; Smith
2014) is by far the great source of uncertainty on this path. Mass-
loss due to both the interaction between the constituent stars and
the radiation-driven winds is key in determining the final masses,
explosion taxonomy, orbital properties and, consequently, the rate
of merger events across cosmic time (e.g. Vink 2022; Eldridge &
Stanway 2022, and references therein). For decades, the theoretical
andobservationalchallengesposedespeciallybytheinhomogeneity
of stellar winds hinder any solid prediction. CWBs involving WR
stars can present a great opportunity for independent constraints on
some stellar parameters, such as the wind density and momentum
ratio, just prior to the stellar demise.
Additionally,therehasbeensubstantialrecentinterestinthedust-
producing subset of CWBs consisting of a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet
(WC) primary star in orbit with a less evolved companion (Lau
et al. 2020a), on account of their very high dust-formation rates. 3D
hydrodynamicalsimulationsoftheWR140(Eatsonetal.2022b)and
WR104(Soulainetal.2023)systemsincludingmodelsofdust-grain
growth have been presented to compare with existing observations
and in anticipation of new results with JWST. Dust shells in the
WR140 system were recently observed using ground-based near-
IR imaging (Han et al. 2022) and JWST mid-IR images (Lau et al.
©2023 The AuthorsarXiv:2301.13716v2  [astro-ph.HE]  13 Sep 20232 J. Mackey et al.
2022). The extreme CWB Apep was also observed at high angular
resolution by Han et al. (2020), spatially resolving the dust plume.
Although dust production in WC binaries is poorly understood
(Cherchneff 2015), a basic requirement is that the gas must cool
below the dust sublimation temperature (typically about 1500K),
and so must first cool from the coronal post-shock temperatures
(107−108K) to nebular temperature ( ∼104K) and then further
to∼103K. This implies that the shocks must be radiative; Stevens
et al. (1992) provide approximate criteria for radiative shocks based
on collisional cooling processes in the thermal plasma, namely X-
ray/UVlineemissionandfree-free(bremsstrahlung)emission.These
processes are routinely included in 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simu-
lations(e.g.Pittard2009;Pittard&Parkin2010;Maduraetal.2013;
Lamberts et al. 2017; Eatson et al. 2022a,b; Soulain et al. 2023).
Inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of background radiation fields
by non-relativistic electrons is well known as a cooling mechanism
for hot, low-density plasmas, from the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect(Sunyaev&Zeldovich1972;Birkinshaw1999)inGalaxyClus-
ters, and from models of the thermal evolution of the intergalactic
medium (e.g. Wiersma et al. 2009). King (2003) recognised that IC
cooling may also be important in models of AGN-driven outflows
fromgalaxies,althoughtheequationsusedareonlyapplicabletorel-
ativisticelectrons.Faucher-Giguère&Quataert(2012)andRichings
& Faucher-Giguère (2018) calculated results for IC cooling from
both relativistic and non-relativistic electrons in AGN-driven out-
flows,alsoincludingthecasewhereelectronsandionshavedifferent
temperatures. The process is also included by Hopkins et al. (2018)
in the FIRE-2 radiative cooling model for cooling of hot gas off the
CMB.
In CWBs the circumstellar medium experiences an intense ra-
diation field with a spectral energy distribution that approximately
follows that of a blackbody with the temperature of the surface of
theneareststar, 𝑇eff.Cherepashchuk(1976)firstarguedthatICcool-
ing of the thermal electrons could play an important role in CWBs,
predictingthatforshort-periodsystemstheX-rayemissioncouldbe
suppressedbyuptoafactorof20duetoICcooling.Thiswasfurther
discussed in White & Chen (1995), who noted that Stevens et al.
(1992) overpredicted the thermal X-ray emission from V444Cyg in
a hydrodynamical model, possibly because they neglected IC cool-
ing. Myasnikov & Zhekov (1993) included IC cooling in models of
CWBs that included wind acceleration, finding that it can be impor-
tant for determining X-ray emission from close binaries. The only
other implementation of IC cooling in hydrodynamical simulations
(as far as we are aware) is by St-Louis et al. (2005), who used 2D
simulationstomodelthewindcollisionintheSMCCWBSanduleak
1 (a WO4+O4 system). The process is also briefly mentioned, but
not implemented, in Lamberts et al. (2012).
TheseresultsserveasmotivationtoinvestigateICcoolinginclose

the process is rarely included in theoretical modelling, simulations
orinterpretationofX-rayobservations.Inthispaperwemakeamore

scribing gas properties in CWB systems as well as estimates for the

are then applied in section 4 to the specific case of the CWB system

and 3D simulations. Some discussion is presented in section 5, in-cludingaproposalofamethodtobetterconstrainthemass-lossrate

2 THEORETICAL MODEL AND NUMERICAL METHODS
2.1 Colliding-wind binaries
The shocks in a CWB form where the ram pressure of the two
winds are equal, forming a contact discontinuity and two reflected
shocks that quickly reach a stationary configuration in the absence
of radiative cooling and dynamical instabilities (Luo et al. 1990;
Stevens et al. 1992). The winds are usually substantially ionized by

a beta-law with 𝛽=1. This is a rough approximation (e.g. Sander
& Vink 2020) but is sufficient for our purposes. The wind velocity,

where𝑅★isthestellarsurfaceorsomeequivalentsurfacewherethe
wind velocity is small. The winds are supersonic by definition, and
usually hypersonic so that, at the wind termination shock, we can
use the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions for a strong shock. The
post-shock density, 𝜌psis therefore simply obtained from the wind
density,𝜌𝑤(𝑟), as
𝜌ps=4𝜌𝑤(𝑟)=¤𝑀
𝜋𝑟2𝑉(𝑟), (2)
where¤𝑀is the mass-loss rate of the star, assumed spherically sym-
metric and smooth.
The location of the wind collision can be calculated as a function
of the wind-momentum ratios of the two stars (Luo et al. 1990;
Miyamoto et al. 2022):
𝜂≡¤𝑀1𝑉1(𝑑1)
¤𝑀2𝑉2(𝑑2)=𝑑1
𝑑22
, (3)
where𝑑1and𝑑2are the distances from the centres of stars 1 and
2 to the wind-collision zone, respectively. If one ignores the wind
acceleration and uses 𝑉∞for the velocities then this is trivial to
solve for a given total separation 𝑑=𝑑1+𝑑2. The situation is much
more complicated including the wind acceleration because within
theaccelerationzoneofstar1,thewindofstar2willbedecelerated
by the same radiation force that accelerates the wind of star 1. For
the purposes of calculating the shock position we ignore the wind
acceleration.
We define the mean mass per electron, 𝜇e, in units of the proton
mass,𝑚p, as
𝜇e≡𝜌

(1+𝑄)/𝐴≈0.5formetalswithatomicnumber 𝑄andmassnumber

𝜇=0.62.

is later used to compare with the cooling timescales to determine at
whatseparationsashockwillberadiativeoradiabatic(Stevensetal.
1992 refer to this as 𝑡esc).
Stevens et al. (1992) introduced the cooling parameter
𝜒≡𝜏cool

¤𝑀−7, (10)
where𝑣8is the wind velocity in units of 108cms−1,𝑑12is the
distancefromthestartothecontactdiscontinuityinunitsof 1012cm
and¤𝑀−7is the mass-loss rate of the star in units of 10−7M⊙yr−1.
Thisisbasedontheassumptionthatthecoolingrateisapproximately
constant with temperature in the temperature range of shocks with
𝑣8∼1. The relation has been very widely used in the literature
since its introduction. If IC cooling is important (for which 𝜏ichas
no dependence on temperature or density) then this relation will not
be applicable.
2.2 IC cooling of the thermal plasma
The IC heating rate of photons (and cooling rate of the gas) for a
non-relativistic gas is given by (e.g. Rybicki & Lightman 1979)
¤𝐸ic=4𝑘B𝑇
𝑚e𝑐2𝜎T𝑐𝑛e𝑈𝛾(erg cm−3s−1), (11)
where𝑚etheelectronmass, 𝑇thegastemperature, 𝜎TtheThomson
cross-section,andthephotonenergydensityis 𝑈𝛾.Notethateffects
due to the anisotropy of the radiation field scale with 𝛽=𝑣/𝑐and
so does not arise here because we are considering non-relativistic
electrons. The above expression holds if 𝑇is much larger than the
radiation temperature of the photon field, but goes to zero if the
temperatures are comparable. For the numerical implementation wereplace𝑇with(𝑇−𝑇eff),where𝑇effisthesurfacetemperatureofthe
star.
The IC cooling time of the thermal plasma (assuming electrons
and ions have a single temperature, 𝑇; see section 3) is 𝜏ic≡𝐸/¤𝐸ic,
which depends only on 𝑈𝛾and can be expressed as
𝜏ic=3𝜇e𝑚e𝑐
8𝜇𝜎T(𝑈𝛾)−1. (12)
A similar expression was obtained by Myasnikov & Zhekov (1993).
This can be expressed according to parameters of the system as
𝜏ic=2.89×105s𝐿★
106L⊙−1𝑟
1013cm2
, (13)
where𝑟is the distance from the star (with luminosity 𝐿★) to the
shocked gas and we have used ISM abundances for 𝜇and𝜇e. This
expression assumes that 𝑟is at least a few stellar radii, so that the
dilution factor reduces to the inverse square law. King (2003) used
the relativistic expression for the energy loss rate and so obtained
that𝜏icscaled inversely with the energy of the gas (or ∝𝑣−2for
shock velocity 𝑣in the expanding AGN outflow). This may be true
for outflows from AGN if they are driven by the pressure of rela-
tivistic particles, but it is not appropriate for CWBs. It is important
here that𝜏icis independent of gas temperature because CWBs with
large eccentricity frequently have wind-wind collisions within the
wind-acceleration region where the shock velocity (and post-shock
temperature)isnotassimpletoestimateasforwiderbinarieswhere
the terminal velocity of the wind can be used.
For IC cooling we can define a parameter similar to the 𝜒of
Stevens et al. (1992) as
𝜒ic≡𝜏ic
𝜏adv=1.61𝑑12𝑣8
𝐿5, (14)
where𝐿5istheluminosityofthestarinunitsof 105L⊙,𝑑12and𝑣8
have the same meaning as in Equation 10. When 𝜒ic<1then we
expect a shock to be radiative.
The Compton y parameter, 𝑦c, measures the fractional energy
change per photon passing through a region, and for the non-
relativistic limit is given by
𝑦c=4𝑘B𝑇
𝑚e𝑐2max(𝜏es,𝜏2
es), (15)
where𝜏es=∫
𝑛e𝜎T𝑑ℓis the electron-scattering optical depth of
the region being considered. If 𝑦cis small then the spectrum and
total energy of the photon field are not significantly modified by IC
scattering(e.g.Rybicki&Lightman1979).TheeffectofICscattering
on the thermal electron population, on the other hand, depends also
on the photon flux in the region: the electrons may be efficiently
cooled even if 𝑦c≪1, if the photon field is sufficiently intense.
The local cooling rate ¤𝐸icis the photon energy flux, 𝑐𝑈𝛾, times the
integrand of the 𝑦cintegral along the photon trajectory.
Equation 11 only holds in the limit that 𝑦c≪1(otherwise the
full Kompaneets equation should be solved), so we should estimate
the typical values expected in CWBs. Luo et al. (1990) calculate
that the thickness of the shocked region, Δ𝑟, in an adiabatic wind-
wind collision is Δ𝑟≈𝑟/8, where𝑟is the distance to the star. We
canapproximatethisregionashavingconstantdensityandpressure,
with𝜌=4𝜌𝑤(𝑟)=¤𝑀/(𝜋𝑟2𝑣sh)asabove.Thentheintegralbecomes
trivial and we obtain (for 𝜏es<𝜏2es):
𝑦c=4𝑘B𝑇
𝑚e𝑐2¤𝑀𝜎 T
𝜋𝑟𝑣sh𝜇e𝑚pΔ𝑟
𝑟≈8.0×10−6¤𝑀−7𝑣8
𝑑12. (16)
Evenfordenseandfastwindswithshocksclosetothestellarsurface,
MNRAS 000, 1–16 (2023)4 J. Mackey et al.
𝑦c≪1will always be satisfied and the medium is optically thin.
This simplifies the numerical implementation in multi-dimensional
simulationsbecausetheradiationfieldisnotsignificantlyaffectedby
IC scattering. IC cooling can therefore be implemented as a purely
localprocessdependingonlyonthegaspropertiesanddistancefrom
the two stars in the binary system.
2.3 Free-free cooling of the thermal plasma
For stellar winds from classical WR and O stars (with 𝑉∞≳
2000kms−1), the postshock temperature is large enough that free-
free cooling (bremsstrahlung) is the dominant collisional cooling
process. All ions are fully ionized by the shock and so there are no
spectral lines available for cooling.
Bremsstrahlung (free-free radiation) has a stronger scaling with
density but weaker scaling with temperature than IC cooling:
¤𝐸ff≈1.68×10−27𝑛e𝑛𝑖𝑄2

𝑇(erg cm−3s−1), (17)
where𝑛𝑖and𝑄𝑖arethenumberdensityandatomicnumberforeach

given by
𝜏ff=3𝜇e𝑚p𝑘B
3.36×10−27𝜇(𝑋+𝑌+0.5Í

𝑇
𝜌. (19)
This can be expressed in terms of parameters of the system (for the
ISM abundances quoted above) as
𝜏ff=5.02×106s¤𝑀
10−6M⊙yr−1−1𝑟
1013cm2𝑉∞
2×108cm s−12
(20)
where𝑟is the distance from the star to the shocked gas. Comparing
Equations (13) and (20) we can expect that there are regions of
parameterspacewhereICcoolingwilldominate.SimilarlytotheIC
cooling calculation above, we can define for free-free cooling:
𝜒ff≡𝜏ff
𝜏adv=7.02𝑑12𝑣3
8
¤𝑀−7, (21)
where𝑑12,𝑣8and¤𝑀−7have the same meanings as in Equation 10.
The scaling is different from that of Stevens et al. (1992) because
they considered lower temperature gas with 𝑣8≈1where¤𝐸is
approximately flat with temperature, whereas we assume 𝑣8≳1.5
where free-free cooling dominates.
For the 2D and 3D simulations presented later we use the col-
lisional ionization-equilibrium cooling function of Eatson et al.
(2022a), with lookup tables kindly provided to us by J. Pittard. The
tabulated cooling rate is ¤𝐸cie=(𝜌/𝜇)2Λcie(𝑇), and the cooling
timescale for collisional processes is 𝜏cie≡𝐸int/¤𝐸cie. This cooling
function includes free-free radiation, which dominates at high tem-
peratures,butalsoincludesmetal-linecoolingatlowertemperatures
and so is not simply a power-law in temperature like ¤𝐸ff.

2.4 Implementation of a numerical algorithm
We used the (magneto-)hydrodynamics code pion(Mackey et al.
2021)tomake2Dand3Dsimulationsofthewind-windcollisionof
the two stars in the WR140 system for different stellar separations.
The2Dhydrodynamic(HD)simulationsusecylindricalcoordinates
in the𝑅-𝑧plane (with rotational symmetry in the 𝜃direction). The
twostarsarestaticandonthe 𝑧-axis(i.e.,orbitalmotionisignored),
and static mesh-refinement (with multiply nested grids) with 6 lev-
els is used to focus resolution on the wind-collision region. The
3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations use Cartesian coor-
dinatescentredonthecentreofmassofthesystem,withthetwostars
movingalongtheirorbitfromtheinitialpositionthroughperiastron.
Again static mesh-refinement is used as demonstrated in Mackey
et al. (2021), very similar to the setup of Eatson et al. (2022a), here
with 7 levels of refinement. An example of a slice through the grid
midplaneisplottedinFig.1withtheorbitsofthetwostarsinWR140
overlaid (see section 4.5 for more details).
Four code enhancements were required to enable the 2D and 3D
simulations:high-resolutionandrobustRiemannsolvers,windaccel-
eration, stellar orbital motion and composition-dependent radiative
cooling.TheHLLDandRoesolverstypicallyusedforMHDandHD
provednotsufficientlyrobustfortheCWBsimulations,evenwiththe
switch to HLL solvers for cells with strong shocks (Mignone et al.
2012). An extra criterion was added to revert to HLL solver if the
density jump from one cell to the next exceeded a factor of 5 for
MHD or 10 for HD (i.e., strong contact discontinuity). This limits
how sharply a contact discontinuity can be resolved, but still allows
the development of dynamical instabilities at the interface.
A simple model for wind acceleration is implemented, using a 𝛽
law with𝛽=1and an initial wind velocity of 𝑉0=4𝑐s(𝑇eff)at

required to accelerate the wind, for which we linearly decrease the
acceleration from its nominal value to zero in the temperature range
[1−2]×106K. We do not distinguish between wind composition,
so that the WR wind is decelerated by the radiation field of the O
star. This is a relatively crude approximation compared with imple-
mentationsoftheso-calledCAKcoefficients(e.g.Pittard2009),but
it is sufficient to demonstrate the importance of IC cooling. More
detailed wind acceleration will be implemented in future work.
For 3D simulations we implemented orbital motion using a
leapfrog integrator to solve the 2-body gravitational problem for
unequal point masses. The stars are given initial positions and ve-
locities,appropriatelypre-calculatedfortheperiod,eccentricityand
semi-major axis of the system and at the desired orbital phase. The
wind speeds are always much larger than the orbital velocity (by
about a factor of 10), and so the hydrodynamic timestep is always
more restrictive than that of the orbital motion. The interior of the
star is given unphysical values so that it is easily identified on plots
(lowandconstantvaluesofdensity,pressure,velocityandmagnetic
field).Thewindboundaryregionisdefinedasaspherewhoseradius,
𝑟w, satisfies the criteria:
(i)𝑟wat least 2 cells larger than the stellar radius, 𝑅★, on the

ensure that the wind is supersonic and super-Alfvénic on entering
the simulation domain, but it imposes limits on how close to the
starwecanresolvethehydrodynamicsanditimposesanupperlimit
on the surface magnetic field strength of the stars. Neither of these
limitations is a problem for this paper because we are not interested
here in strongly magnetised stars.
Radiative cooling follows the two-component cooling function of
Eatson et al. (2022a). We distinguish between the two wind com-
positions by use of a passive scalar and the total cooling rate is a
linear combination of the two cooling functions, with weights de-
termined by the passive scalar. We do not include the dust cooling
of Eatson et al. (2022a), but instead add the IC cooling from both
stars as described above. We assume the gas is optically thin to the
bulkofthestellarcontinuumradiation,andsodonotneedtoemploy
ray-tracing to calculate attenuation factors. Instead we calculate the
local radiation energy density at every point on the domain for each
star, according to an integration of the specific intensity, 𝐼(Ω), over
solid angle:

Star 1 is considered to have parameters similar to a WR star, with
𝐿1=3×105L⊙and¤𝑀1=3×10−5M⊙yr−1.Forstar2weconsider
four cases:
(i) Case 1:𝐿2=3×105L⊙,𝑣∞=2000kms−1;
(ii) Case 2: 𝐿2=3×105L⊙,𝑣∞=3000kms−1;
(iii) Case 3: 𝐿2=106L⊙,𝑣∞=2000kms−1; and
(iv) Case 4: 𝐿2=106L⊙,𝑣∞=3000kms−1.
Forsimplicitywetake 𝑣∞ofstars1and2tobethesame,sothatthe
winddensitiesareequalatthewind-collisionregion(becauseofram-
pressurebalance).Themass-lossrateofstar2isavariableinthefol-
lowinganalysis,definedby ¤𝑀2=𝜂¤𝑀1forequalwindvelocities.We
consider a range of values for 𝑑and𝜂, namely𝑑∈[1012,1015]cm
(≈0.067-67au) and 𝜂∈[0.01,1]. This covers most of the parame-
ter space of binary systems where we expect to encounter radiative
shocks.
Note that𝜏ic,𝜏ffand𝜏cieall have the same scaling with distance
from the star, because the photon density and wind mass-density

is<1and IC cooling dominates over collisional cooling. For Case

cooling is dominant for 𝜂 >0.1but, for the cases where star 2 is 3×
moreluminous,ICcoolingdominatesalmostupto 𝜂=1.Thecurves
are almost indentical if we replace 𝜏ciewith𝜏ffbecause of the high

shockisradiativewillbewrongbothqualitativelyandquantitatively
if IC cooling is not included. For 𝜂≪1, the range of 𝑑where
𝜏cool< 𝜏advcan be up to 50×larger when IC cooling is included
(Fig. 3).

would need to have two stars with Wolf-Rayet type winds (if not
stronger)andverysmallseparations(orbitalperiodontheorderofa

in assuming 𝑦c≪1.
Theimmediatepostshocktemperatureoftheionsandelectronsis

interactions on a timescale calculated by Spitzer (1962). Faucher-
Giguère&Quataert(2012)arguethatICcoolingcanbelessefficient
inAGN-drivenoutflowsthantheaboveequationssuggestbecauseof
inefficient electron-ion coupling. Using the equilibration timescale,
𝜏eq, quoted in, e.g., Pollock et al. (2005), we plot in Fig. 5 the ratio
log10𝜏cool/𝜏eq. This shows that 𝜏cool/𝜏eq>1for all cases over the
wholeparameterspace,andformostoftheparameterspacetheratio
is∼[10−100], and so the electrons should reach the equilibrium
single-fluid, post-shock temperature before they begin to cool. The
region of parameter space where radiative shocks occur due to IC
cooling (the lower left part of each panel) is, however, the region
with the lowest 𝜏cool/𝜏eqratio, and so it could be that for stars with
exceptionally fast winds and heavy element compositions, the ratio
could approach unity and the single-fluid assumption would then
no longer be valid. For example case 4 in Fig. 5 has the strongest
photon field with large wind velocity, and here 𝜏cool/𝜏eq→1.6at
the bottom left corner of the panel (small separation and extreme
wind momentum-ratio). In this case we do not expect full electron-
ion equilibrium to be attained, and the IC cooling rate is limited by
the collisional electron-heating rate.
These results show that IC cooling is a crucial ingredient in de-
termining whether or not shocks in CWB systems will be radiative
or adiabatic, and it is especially important for systems with very
disparate mass-loss rates ( 𝜂≪1) and where the stars come very
close to each other for at least part of their orbit ( 𝑑≲3×1013cm,
or 2.0au). One system that satisfies both of these requirements is
WR140, discussed in detail in the next section.

Dougherty et al. (2005) spatially resolved the synchrotron emission
from the shocked wind with radio interferometry, and this was fur-
ther interpreted by Pittard & Dougherty (2006) in the context of an
analytic model of particle acceleration and radiation. High-energy
𝛾-ray emission has not been detected (Pshirkov 2016), although the
brightdiffuseemissionfromtheCygnusregionmakesanydetection

2000) and 3D (Russell et al. 2011) adiabatic simulations has given
some insight into the X-ray lightcurve, and a semianalytic model by
Zhekov (2021) has highlighted the important role of absorption in
determiningtheobservedlightcurve.Pollocketal.(2021)havemod-

For CWB systems the composition of the two winds may be very
different, and this affects the cooling timescales and postshock gas

[𝑋,𝑌,𝑍] ≈ [ 0.7,0.28,0.02]. For the WC primary star the wind

4.1 Properties of the binary system
The properties of the two stars in the system and their winds are
somewhat uncertain. For IC cooling the key parameter is the lumi-
nosityofeachstar.Doughertyetal.(2005)estimate log𝐿/𝐿⊙=6.18

estimate log𝐿/𝐿⊙=5.93and 5.5 for the two stars. We will take
log𝐿O/𝐿⊙=6.0for the O star and log𝐿WR/𝐿⊙=5.5for the WR
star.TheradiationtemperatureisnotimportantfortheICcooling,as
longasthetypicalphotonenergyismuchsmallerthantheenergyof
theshockedelectrons.Forwindspeedof 2000kms−1(whichwemay
take as a minimum expected shock speed given the terminal veloc-
ities quoted below) the post-shock temperature is 𝑇e=5.6×107K,
much larger than the effective temperature of any star.
The stellar radius is important for wind acceleration, and we take
𝑅O=26R⊙for the O star (Williams et al. 2009) and 𝑅WR=
2.16R⊙(or1.5×1011cm) for the WR star. The relevant radius for
wind acceleration of the WR star is the sonic point, and Grassitelli
et al. (2018) showed that this is at approximately [0.9-1.5]R ⊙for
the classical WR stars (the exact value is not important for any of
the calculations in this paper). The terminal wind velocity of both
stars is quite well constrained, with 𝑉∞,O=3100kms−1for the
O star and𝑉∞,W=2860kms−1for the WR star (Williams et al.
2009).Mass-lossratesarequiteuncertain:fortheOstartheestimates
range from¤𝑀=8.7×10−7M⊙yr−1(Pittard & Dougherty 2006)
to¤𝑀=8×10−6M⊙yr−1(Dougherty et al. 2005); here we also
consider¤𝑀O=1×10−6M⊙yr−1as a representative value because
most literature estimates tend toward the lower end of this range
(e.g. Pollock et al. 2021). For the WR star ¤𝑀W=10−5.5M⊙yr−1
is a typical value (Williams et al. 2009). Two cases are listed in
Table1correspondingtolowandmediumvaluesof 𝜂,i.e,𝜂=0.022
and𝜂=0.044, respectively. The low- 𝜂parameters are the extreme
values from the parameter study of Pittard & Dougherty (2006),
and the mid- 𝜂values the preferred result from the X-ray analysis of
Sugawara et al. (2015).4.2 Cooling time as function of orbital separation

from both stars, as a function of 𝑑, as in the previous section.

stronger wind and so the curvature radius of the shocked region is
determinedbythedistancetotheOstar,nottheWRstar.Inpanel(a)
we assume with the red curves that the WR wind is not decelerated
by the O star’s radiation, whereas in the blue curves we assume that
it is according to
𝑉W(𝑑O)=𝑉∞,W
1−𝑅★,O
𝑑O
, (31)
where𝑑Ois the distance to the O star. The latter case is what is
includedinthemulti-dimensionalsimulationsbelow,whereasreality
is probably somewhere in between these two extremes.
For the shocked WR wind 𝜏icis∼30×shorter than 𝜏ff, and
the shock is radiative near periastron. In the case where the WR
wind is decelerated, 𝜏advis longer near periastron and the shock
is radiative over a larger range of radii. For the O star the shock
should be radiative at periastron without IC cooling, but only at
periastron. With the inclusion of IC cooling the region of parameter
space where the shocks are radiative is significantly increased to
𝑑≈2au (3×1013cm).
Results for the mid- 𝜂set of mass-loss rates (everything else kept
constant) are shown in Fig. 7. Here we see that, because the wind
collision region is moved further from the O star, the IC cooling
timescaleisabout 3×longerthaninthelow- 𝜂case,andsotheshocks
should be radiative over a shorter range of orbital separations.
For both low- 𝜂and mid-𝜂cases the IC cooling timescale is much
shorterthanthecollisional-coolingtimescale, 𝜏cie,andsoonecannot
obtain the correct physical result without considering IC cooling. A
key observation of the WR140 system is that the X-ray emission
drops dramatically near periastron (Pollock et al. 2021) and line
emissionfromintermediateionizationelementsincreases,indicative
ofatransitionfromanadiabatictoaradiativeshock.ICcoolingcan

simulationsinSections4.4and4.5(efficientlydeceleratedWRwind)
the electron-ion equilibration is not limiting the efficiency of IC
cooling when radiative shocks are predicted.
These results agree with the conclusion of Pollock et al. (2005)
that the collisional coupling of electrons and ions is weak in the
shocks of WR140 over most of the orbit. The only difference is that
we include effects of wind acceleration (and deceleration), and this
modifies the timescales near periastron. We find that 𝜏eq,Ois by far

We used the (magneto-)hydrodynamics code pion(Mackey et al.
2021)tomake2Dsimulationsofthewind-windcollisionofthetwo
stars in the WR140 system for different stellar separations, using
the 2D setup described in section 2.4. The cylindrical 𝑅-𝑧plane is
simulated (with rotational symmetry in the angular direction), and
the two stars are static and on the 𝑧-axis. Simulations were run for
separations ranging from 𝑑=1.4au (2.1×1013cm; approximately
periastron for WR140) to 𝑑=6.7au (1×1014cm).
The outer (coarse) grid has 𝑧∈[− 5,5]×1014cm,𝑅∈[0,5]×
1014cm and 512×256cells, and a further 5 nested grids centred
on the origin. Each of these is identical to the coarse grid except
successively with cell diameter Δ𝑥a factor of 2 smaller than the
level above. The finest grid has 𝑧∈ [− 1.5625,1.5625]×1013cm
(or±1.04au),𝑅∈[0,1.5625]×1013cm andΔ𝑥≈6.1×1010cm
(0.004au). The O-star is placed at 𝑧=−𝑑/3and the WR star at
𝑧=2𝑑/3, and the stars are assumed to be unmagnetized and to
emit a spherically symmetric wind. The simulations are run with a
CFL parameter of 0.3, and snapshots are saved every 0.25d until
thesimulationsreachesastationarystateorfully-developedunstable
flow. Simulations were run for the low- 𝜂and mid-𝜂set of mass-loss
rates (see Table 1).

the apex of the wind-wind collision. This is expected from Fig. 6,
which shows that the O-star shocked wind should be radiative with

indicating that some cooling has taken place, but not sufficient for
runaway cooling to set in. For the run without IC cooling this layer
is much less prominent, indicating that both shocks are effectively
adiabatic, as expected from Fig. 6.
The unstable simulations in Fig. 8 show prominent spikes along
the symmetry axis. These arise because of the imposed rotational
symmetry and the coordinate singularity: no gas can cross the cell

fore periastron, visible from the high-density sheets at the contact
dicontinuity and termination shock of the WR wind. These are, re-
spectively, the cooled wind from the O star and the WR star. We
do not see much instability in the flow before periastron, in contrast
to the results of Eatson et al. (2022b), probably because we do not
include the dust cooling that is effective in these sheets. IC cooling
is only effective very close to the stars, whereas the dust cooling is

At periastron the shocks in the wind-collision region become ra-
diative and dynamically unstable, seen in the inset to the middle
panel of Fig. 10. The shocked region collapses to a thin sheet that
develops non-linear corrugations that are then swept away from thestagnation point. These are also seen in the large-scale flow in the

then recovers its quasi-adiabatic behaviour and dynamical stability

(𝐿X∝𝑑−1) because the shocks never become strongly radiative.
The simulation with IC cooling ( mhd-2) shows a slower increase in
luminosity compared with the control simulation ( mhd-1) from 100
to 20 days before periastron. The same result is seen in simulation
mhd-3, demonstrating that this is due to wind acceleration: as the

the post-shock pressure is larger before periastron because the stars

The simulation with IC cooling provides a much better qualitative
match to the observations than without, although we have not tuned
the simulation parameters at all to obtain this match (apart from
choosing wind parameters recommended by Sugawara et al. 2015).

5 DISCUSSION
A necessary, though not sufficient requirement for dust formation in
CWBs, is that the shocked plasma cools from the postshock tem-
perature,𝑇∼107−108K to lower temperatures. Cooling proceeds
approximately isobarically, and so the collisional-cooling timescale
decreases as 𝑇decreases and 𝜌increases. Once collisional cooling
becomes efficient, a runaway process down to 𝑇∼104K develops,
with the bottleneck at the highest temperatures.
Given the best observational estimates of the wind properties in
WR140, we showed that the postshock plasma should not be able
to cool when only collisional processes are included, and that (near
periastron) IC cooling can increase the cooling rate sufficiently to
drive the shocks into the radiative regime, allowing cooling to ∼
104K. Further cooling to ∼103K requires the gas to become self-
shielding,allowingmoleculeandeventuallydustformation,andour
simulationshaveneitherthedynamicrangenorthechemicalkinetics
needed to model this. Nevertheless we argue that IC cooling is a
necessary ingredient in any shock-cooling model for WR140 (and
other CWBs) that aims to to determine when and where dust is
produced during the orbit.
WhileWR140providesanexcellentcasestudyoftheimportance
of IC cooling, there are many other WR binary systems, of which
some produce dust and some do not. For example, WR104 is a
persistentdustproducerfromacloserbinaryinamorecircularorbit
(period200d)withseparation 𝑑≈3×1013cmor2au(Tuthilletal.
1999), which has orbital, wind and stellar parameters that put it in
theICcoolingregime.Thelong-periodsystemWR112,incontrast,
mustbeintheregimeofline-drivenradiativecoolingbecauseofthe
relativelyslowwindandlargemass-lossrateoftheWCstar,together
with the relatively large wind momentum ratio, 𝜂≈0.13(Lau et al.
2020b).
The nearby CWB 𝛾2Velorum (WR11) has a wind collision zone
withsimilarorbitalseparationasWR140atperiastron,butdoesnot
produce any dust (see e.g., the discussion in Lau et al. 2020a). The
timescales in the wind collision region of this system are plotted
in Fig. 12, using the wind parameters from Lamberts et al. (2017)
and stellar parameters from Reitberger et al. (2017). We see that
IC cooling dominates over collisional processes, and should induce
sufficientcoolingsothatradiativeshocksarepresentforatleastpart
of the orbit. Why 𝛾2Velorum does not then produce dust is not
clear, although dust formation in such extreme environments is not
well-understood(Cherchneff2015),beingdependentontheradiation
field, gas density, composition, and dynamical timescale of the gas.
Realistic modelling of the physical conditions in the wind-collision
zone is a required input to any theoretical model for dust formation,
and Fig. 12 shows that IC cooling is an important ingredient.

work.
5.1 Observational signatures
AnobservationalsignaturethatICcoolingisthedominantcoolantin
aregionisareductionintheobservedX-rayemissioncomparedwith
expectations (especially hard X-ray emission from the hottest gas).
This process takes energy from the thermal electrons and adds it to
the local radiation field, but the photon energy is only significantly
changed if the electrons are relativistic (multiplied by 𝛾2, where𝛾
is the Lorentz factor of the electrons), or where a system is in the
𝑦c≫1multiple-scatteringlimit.Suchavariationcanbedetectedas
the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in galaxy clusters because the CMBR
is so well characterised that even a tiny deviation from a blackbody
canbemeasuredwithhighsignificance.Itisverydifficulttomeasure
in the environment of massive stars, however, because the plasma is
so dynamic and spectral lines are already significantly broadened
and shifted by stellar winds and orbital motion, respectively. The
overall increase in energy density of the photon field is negligible
compared with the stellar luminosity because the wind mechanical
luminosity (much of which is converted to thermal energy in the
shocks at the wind-collision zone) is generally only a small fraction
of the radiative luminosity. X-ray light curves are probably the only
unambiguous measurement of the impact of IC cooling.
Acomplicatingfactoristhatinprincipleanycoolingprocessmay
induce runaway radiative cooling, if its cooling timescale is shorter
than the advection time, and this will also reduce the hard X-ray
emission in the same way. For example wind clumping could lo-
cally reduce the collisional cooling timescale in overdense regions
with respect to expectations for a smooth wind. A careful analysis
would be required to exclude the possibility of efficient collisional
cooling and definitively conclude that IC cooling is dominant. It is
notclearwhetherthewindpropertiesofWR140canbeconstrained
well enough to allow such a conclusion. This paper makes an initial
exploration of the applicability of IC cooling to WR140 and poten-
tially other CWB systems, showing that it should be considered and
may in some cases be crucially important.
5.2 Non-thermal radiation
CWBs have been observed to emit non-thermal radiation at radio
and𝛾-ray energies. For example, synchrotron radio emission from
WR140 was measured by Dougherty et al. (2005) as a function of
orbitalphaseofthesystem.TheextremeCWBsystem 𝜂Carhasbeen
observedin𝛾-raysatGeV(Tavanietal.2009;Abdoetal.2010)and
TeV (H.E.S.S. Collaboration et al. 2020) energies, as well as non-
thermalhardX-rays(Sekiguchietal.2009;Hamaguchietal.2018).
Variation of the non-thermal X-ray (Hamaguchi et al. 2018) and 𝛾-
ray(Whiteetal.2020;Martí-Devesa&Reimer2021)emissionwith
orbital phase has been clearly detected. Possible orbital variability
at GeV energies has also been reported from the CWB 𝛾2Velorum
(WR 11) using FERMIdata (Martí-Devesa et al. 2020),
Thenon-thermalradioemissionissynchrotronradiationfromrel-
ativistic electrons that depends on the local magnetic field strength,
while the non-thermal X-rays are most plausibly produced by IC
scattering off the same electrons. Diffusive shock acceleration is the

tion or simulation of the magnetic fields with the hydrodynamics.
Wehavedemonstratedarobustmethodtoincludemagneticfieldsin
3D simulations of CWBs, and in future work we will use the results
fromtheseandsimilarsimulationstopredictbroadbandnon-thermal
emission for quantitative comparison with observations such as the
above results.
These detections of non-thermal emission from CWBs raise the
prospectthatthenextgenerationofhigh-energyobservatories,espe-
ciallytheCherenkovTelescopeArray(Actisetal.2011),maybeable
to observe time-dependent non-thermal emisison from many CWB
systems in the Galaxy. Detailed modelling of the phase-dependent
propertiesoftheshocks,thethermalplasmaandmagneticfields,will
be an important step towards understanding particle acceleration in
these systems.
5.3 Mass-loss rates of stars in CWBs
For eccentric systems where IC cooling is the dominant process
determiningthetransitionfromadiabatictoradiativeshocks,thisin-
troducesanextraconstraintonthepropertiesofthesystemthatcould
be used to better determine the mass-loss rates of the two stars. The
IC cooling time is independent of density (Equation 13), depending
only on the radiation energy density from the two stars. This means
that, to the extent that the orbital parameters, stellar luminosity and
wind velocities are known, the location of the wind-collision region
isdeterminedattheorbitalphasewheretheshocksswitchfromadi-
abatic to radiative, and so 𝜂is determined without any knowledge
of the wind density. The X-ray emission far from periastron (in the
adiabatic regime, where cooling is mainly from free-free emission)
can also be used to measure the density in the wind-collision zone.
Becauseweknow 𝜂,thewinddensityandtherespectivewindspeeds,
this determines the mass-loss rates of both stars. Alternatively, if ¤𝑀
for one of the stars can be measured accurately from optical/UV
spectral analysis, then knowledge of 𝜂determines¤𝑀of the weaker
component. As far as we are aware this has not been proposed in
the literature, and could provide an independent constraint on the
otherwisedegenerateestimatesfortherateofmass-lossbyclumped
stellar winds.
The IC cooling timescale is independent of gas density, and so
both the overdense clumps and the underdense surroundings will be
equally cooled by this process. With collisional cooling, the denser
clumps cool more rapidly and may effectively decouple from the
lower-density plasma which remains hot. If IC cooling dominates
to the extent that our results suggest, then wind clumping may not
have significant consequences in the wind-collision zone. All of the
shockedplasmacoolsonthesametimescaleandwillbecompressed
tothepointthatcollisionalcoolingtakesover.TheclumpinginWR
and O-star winds may nevertheless have some effect on our results:
it is thought that the inertia of overdense clumps may allow them to
penetrate through the wind-collision region, closer to the other star,
increasingthegaspressureandpotentiallyproducingtheX-rayflares
observed in𝜂Car and (to a lesser extent) in WR binaries (Moffat &
Corcoran 2009). This broadens the wind-collision region, changing
𝑈𝛾in the shocked gas and therefore changing the IC cooling time.
The degree of clumping as a function of distance from the stellar
surface is important here, whether driven by subsurface convection

strong clumping inferred for line-driven winds (Brands et al. 2022;

6 CONCLUSIONS
WehavemadeadetailedinvestigationoftheimportanceofICcool-
ingoftheshockedthermalplasmaincolliding-windbinarysystems.
This process dominates over free-free cooling for a wide range of
parameter space, and can be the determining factor as to whether or
notashockwillbeadiabaticorradiative.Closebinaries(oreccentric
binaries near periastron) are expected to have radiative shocks and
the parameter space with 𝜂≪1is dominated by IC cooling. Esti-
matesofwhetherashockisradiativecanbewrongbothqualitatively
andquantitativelyifICcoolingisnotincluded,especiallyfor 𝜂≪1
where the cooling time can be shortened by 10−100×when IC
coolingisconsidered.ThestandardcriterionofStevensetal.(1992)
for determining whether a shock is radiative should be augmented
with a further criterion based on IC cooling for close binaries with
luminous stars. Observations of this transition, compared with de-
tailed numerical simulations, are required to confirm these findings
and advance our understanding of the winds in CWBs.
The region of parameter space where radiative shocks occur due
to IC cooling is also the region with the lowest 𝜏cool/𝜏eqratio, and
socaremustbetakenthatthesingle-fluidassumptionisappropriate.
For WR140 𝜏eqis only slightly shorter than the cooling time in the
WR wind, and so the electrons may never reach the adiabatic post-
shock temperature. This result is very sensitive to the wind velocity
and and to the degree to which the WR wind is decelerated by the
O-starradiationfield.BecausetheOstarinWR140hassuchaweak
wind the wind-collision region is very close to the star, deep in the
wind acceleration zone, and so the wind velocity is not very large
and𝜏eqis much shorter than the other relevant timescales.
ApplyingourresultstotheCWBsystemWR140,wefindthatthe
inclusion of IC cooling can potentially resolve difficulties in mod-
ellingtwoobservations,namelythattheshocksareradiativenearpe-
riastronandthatthehardX-rayemissiondecreasesaroundperiastron
(even after considering absorption effects). 2D and 3D simulations

ThisdecreaseoccursasshocksbecomeradiativethroughICcooling,
andisconsistentwithobservationsofperiastronpassagesofWR140
(Pollock et al. 2021), providing strong observational support for in-
cluding IC coolingin numerical simulations. Adeeper investigation
of this system could strongly confirm (or challenge) our claims.
Moreover, IC cooling in CWBs allows for the novel possibility to
breakthedegeneracybetweenclumpingfactorandmass-lossrateof
massivestarsviaindependentdeterminationofthewindmomentum
ratio,𝜂, in the wind-collision region. Therefore, detailed observa-
tional tests concerning the X-ray temporal evolution in especially
CWBs in the Magellanic Clouds (Gagné et al. 2012), for which the
luminosity of the binary stars can be more precisely determined,
could provide much needed advancements in the determination of
the final properties of massive stars.
IC cooling is not difficult to implement in numerical simulations,
and its decisive role in determining the X-ray lightcurve and shock
thermodynamics in CWB systems demands that it be included, es-
pecially for the close binaries with radiative shocks. The inclusion
of IC cooling and magnetic fields brings a significant leap forward
in the predictive power of 3D simulations of CWB systems. This
will be valuable for predicting both thermal and non-thermal radi-
ation from such systems for the next generation of X-ray and 𝛾-rayobservatories. Careful comparison of models with observation can
also yield better constraints on the mass-loss rates of the stars in
CWBs, providing important empirical data for stellar evolution cal-
culations.Masslossisanimportantprocessindeterminingthefinal

APPENDIX A: EFFECTS OF NUMERICAL RESOLUTION
ON RESULTS NEAR PERIASTRON
Fig. A1 shows a comparison of the X-ray luminosity curves for
themhd-2simulation for resolutions of 128×128×32and256×
256×64cells per level (both simulations have 7 levels of static
mesh-refinement).Thesimulationwithincreasedresolutionshowsa

cooling length has not been spatially resolved. Further increases in
resolutionmayallowthehardX-raycurveforthis mhd-2simulation
to drop deeper in luminosity. We did not have the computational
resources to investigate that for this paper but it will be studied in
future work.
