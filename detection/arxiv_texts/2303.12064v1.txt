RIIKKA KORTE AND TIMO TAKALA
Abstract. The John-Nirenberg spaces JNpare generalizations of the space
of bounded mean oscillation BMOwithJN∞=BMO. Their vanishing
subpaces VJNpandCJNpare deﬁned in similar ways as VMOandCMO,
which are subspaces of BMO. As our main result, we prove that VJNpand
CJNpcoincide by showing that certain Morrey type integrals of JNpfunctions
tend to zero for small and large cubes. We also show that JNp,q(Rn) =
Lp(Rn)/R, ifp=q.
1.Introduction
In 1961 John and Nirenberg studied the well known space of bounde d mean
oscillation BMOand proved the profound John-Nirenberg inequality for BMO
functions[7]. Thespace BMOplaysavitalroleinharmonicanalysisandithasbeen
studied very extensively. In the same article they also deﬁned a gen eralization of
BMO, which is now known as the John-Nirenbergspace, or JNp, with a parameter
1< p <∞, see Deﬁnition 2.3 below. In addition they proved the John-Nirenber g
inequality for JNpfunctions, see Theorem 2.5 below. From this theorem it follows
thatJNp(Q0)⊂Lp,∞(Q0), where Q0⊂Rnis a bounded cube. It is also easy to
see that Lp(Q0)⊂JNp(Q0). Both of these inclusions are strict, however this is
far from trivial. An example of a function in JNp\Lpwas discovered in 2018 [2].
Thus the space JNpis a nontrivial space between LpandLp,∞. However there are
still many unanswered questions related to the study of John-Nire nberg spaces.
Various John–Nirenberg type spaces have attracted attention in recent years, in-
cludingthedyadicJohn-Nirenbergspace[8], thecongruentJohn-N irenbergspace[6,
19], the John-Nirenberg-Campanato space [16, 14] and the spars e John-Nirenberg
space [3]. The John-Nirenberg space can also be deﬁned with medians instead of
using integral averages [10]. Hurri-Syrj¨ anen et al. established a local-to-global re-
sult for the space JNp(Ω), where Ω ⊂Rnis an open set [5] and Marola and Saari
found similar results for JNpin the setting of metric measure spaces [9].
The spaces VMOandCMOarewell knownvanishing subspacesof BMO. They
were introduced by Sarason [13] and Neri [11] respectively. Recen tly there has been
research on the JNpcounterparts of these spaces, which are denoted by VJNpand
CJNp[17]. It follows directly from the deﬁnitions that Lp⊆CJNp⊆VJNp⊆
JNp. Moreover, examples in [15] demonstrate that Lp/\e}atio\slash=CJNpandVJNp/\e}atio\slash=JNp.

However it has been an open question whether the set VJNp\CJNpis nonempty,
see [15, 17]. As our main result we show that VJNpandCJNpcoincide.
Our method is to study Morrey or weak Lptype integrals
|Q|1
p−1ˆ
Q|f|, (1.1)
whereQis a cube. We provethat if f∈JNp, then these integrals tend to zero both
when|Q| →0 and when |Q| → ∞. See Theorems 3.12 and 3.16 below for precise
statements of these results. Note that Lpfunctions have this property, but weak
Lpfunctions do not. From Theorem 3.12 it follows easily that CJNp=VJNp, see
Corollary 3.15.
In Section 2 we brieﬂy study the more general version of the John- Nirenberg
type spaces JNp,q(X), where the L1-norm of the oscillation term is replaced with
theLq-norm where q≥1. This generalization has been studied in [2, 18, 19]. It
has turned out that in case Xis a bounded cube, the JNp,qnorm is equivalent
with the JNpnorm (for q < p) orLqnorm (for q≥p). In case X=Rn, theJNp,q
norm is equivalent with the JNpnorm (for q < p), and if q > p, the space contains
only functions that are constant almost everywhere. We complete this picture by
showing that in the borderline case p=qandX=Rn, this space is equivalent
with the space Lp(Rn)/Ri.e. the space of functions ffor which there is a constant
bsuch that f−b∈Lp(Rn). The result answers a question raised in [19, Remark
2.9].
2.Preliminaries
Throughout this paper by a cube we mean an open cube with edges pa rallel to
the coordinate axes. We let X⊆Rnbe either a bounded cube or the entire space
Rn. IfQis a cube, we denote by l(Q) its side length. For any r >0, we denote
byrQthe cube with the same center as Qbut with side length r·l(Q). For any
measurable set E⊂Rn, such that 0 <|E|<∞, we denote the integral average of
a function foverEby
fE:= 
Ef:=1
|E|ˆ
Ef.
2.1.Deﬁnition (WeakLp-spaces).Let 1≤p <∞. For a measurable function f
we deﬁne
/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp,∞(X):= sup
t>0t|{x∈X:|f(x)|> t}|1/p.
We say that fis a weak Lpfunction, or f∈Lp,∞(X), if/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp,∞(X)is ﬁnite. We
deﬁne
/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp,w(X):= sup
E⊆X
0<|E|<∞|E|1/p 
E|f(x)|dx,
whereEis any measurable set. We say that f∈Lp,w(X), if/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp,w(X)is ﬁnite.
2.2.Remark. The expression /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblLp,∞(X)is not a norm, since the triangle inequality
fails to hold. However /ba∇dbl · /ba∇dblLp,w(X)does deﬁne a norm. Additionally, if p >1,
/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp,∞(X)and/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp,w(X)are comparable and therefore Lp,w(X) =Lp,∞(X), see
Chapter 2.8.3 in [4].EQUALITY OF V JNpANDCJNp 3
2.3.Deﬁnition (JNp).Let 1< p <∞. A function fis inJNp(X) iff∈L1

and there is a constant K <∞such that

Qi|f−fQi|/parenrightbiggp
≤Kp
for all countable collections of pairwise disjoint cubes ( Qi)∞
i=1inX. We denote the
smallest such number Kby/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblJNp(X).
The space JNpisrelated to BMOin the sensethat the BMOnormofa function
is the limit of the function’s JNpnorm when ptends to inﬁnity. It is easy to see
that
/ba∇dbl|f|/ba∇dblJNp(X)≤2/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblJNp(X). (2.4)
Likewise it is clear that Lp(X)⊂JNp(X), as we get from H¨ older’s inequality that
/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblJNp(X)≤2/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblLp(X). IfXis a bounded cube, then JNp(X)⊂Lp,∞(X). This
is known as the John-Nirenberg inequality for JNpfunctions.
2.5.Theorem (John-Nirenberg inequality for JNp).Let1< p <∞,Q0⊂Rna
bounded cube and f∈JNp(Q0). Thenf∈Lp,∞(Q0)and
/ba∇dblf−fQ0/ba∇dblLp,∞(Q0)≤c/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblJNp(Q0)
with some constant c=c(n,p).
The proof can be found in [1, 7] for example. In [15] this result was ex tended
to the space JNp(Rn). Also a more general John-Nirenberg space JNp,qhas been
studied for example in [2, 18, 19].
2.6.Deﬁnition (JNp,q).Let 1≤p <∞and 1≤q <∞. A function fis in
JNp,q(X) iff∈L1

Itwasshownin[2,Proposition5.1]thatif Xisaboundedcube, then JNp,q(X) =
JNp(X), if 1≤q < pandJNp,q(X) =Lq(X) ifp≤q <∞. The same proof also
shows us that JNp,q(Rn) =JNp(Rn), if 1≤q < p. It was shown in [19, Corollary
2.8] that the space JNp,q(Rn) contains only functions that are constant almost
everywhere, if p < q < ∞. However it was stated in [19, Remark 2.9] that the
situation is unclear if q=p. We complete the picture by showing that JNp,p(Rn)
is equal to Lp(Rn) up to a constant. This also answers [18, Question 15].
2.7.Proposition. Let1≤p <∞. ThenJNp,p(Rn) =Lp(Rn)/Rand there is a
constant c=c(p)such that for any function f∈L1

Now assume that f∈JNp,p(Rn). Clearly

For any integer iwe have

The spaces VJNpandCJNpwere studied in [17, 15]. These spaces are JNp
counterparts of the spaces VMOandCMO, which are subspaces of BMO. The
spacesVJNpandCJNpcan also be deﬁned in a bounded cube Q0instead of Rn
as in the following deﬁnitions. However in that case it is clear that the s paces
coincide [17, 15]. In this paper we only deﬁne the spaces in Rnand we write
VJNp=VJNp(Rn) andCJNp=CJNp(Rn) to simplify the notation.EQUALITY OF V JNpANDCJNp 5
2.9.Deﬁnition (VJNp).Let 1< p <∞. Then the vanishing subspace VJNpof
JNpis deﬁned by setting
VJNp:=Dp(Rn)∩JNpJNp,
where
Dp(Rn) :={f∈C∞(Rn) :|∇f| ∈Lp(Rn)}.
2.10.Deﬁnition (CJNp).Let 1< p <∞. Then the subspace CJNpofJNpis
deﬁned by setting
CJNp:=C∞c(Rn)JNp,
whereC∞
c(Rn) denotes the set of smooth functions with compact support in Rn.
As in the case of vanishing subspaces of BMO, there exist characterizations
ofVJNpandCJNpasJNpfunctions for which certain integrals vanish, see [17,
Theorems 3.2 and 4.3].

From the deﬁnitions we can see that Lp/R⊆CJNp⊆VJNp⊆JNp. It was
shown in [15] that Lp/R/\e}atio\slash=CJNpandVJNp/\e}atio\slash=JNp. However the question of
whether CJNpandVJNpcoincide remained open.
3.Equality of VJNpandCJNp
Let 1< p <∞. In this section we prove the equality of VJNpandCJNpby
showing that for any JNpfunction f, integrals of the type
|Q|1
p 
Q|f|
tend to zero both when |Q| →0 and when |Q| → ∞. This type of integral appears
in the Morrey norm, see for example [12]. Compare it also to the weak Lpnorm
(Deﬁnition 2.1), where the supremum is taken over such integrals wit h the cube Q
replaced with an arbitrary measurable set.
The aforementioned results follow from Proposition 3.1.6 R. KORTE AND T. TAKALA
3.1.Proposition. LetX⊆Rnbe either a bounded cube or the entire space Rn.
LetQ⊂Xbe a cube such that 3Q⊆X. Let1< p <∞,0< A < ∞and
0< ǫ≤ǫ0(n,p). Suppose that f∈L1
loc(X)is a nonnegative function such that
|Q|1
p 
Qf≥A(1−ǫ) (3.2)
and for any cube Q′⊂Xwithl(Q′) =2
3l(Q)orl(Q′) =4
3l(Q)we have
|Q′|1
p 
Q′f≤A(1+ǫ). (3.3)
Then there exist two cubes Q1⊂3QandQ2⊂3Qsuch that for i∈ {1,2}we have
l(Qi) =2
3l(Q)orl(Qi) =4
3l(Q), (3.4)

3l(Q),and (3.5)
|Qi|1
p 
Qi|f−fQi| ≥c·A, (3.6)
wherec=c(n,p)is a positive constant.
To prove this proposition we ﬁrst need to prove Lemmas 3.7 and 3.9.
3.7.Lemma. Let0< α <1< β. LetQ′⊂Q⊂˜Q⊂Rnbe cubes such that l(Q′) =
αl(Q)andl(˜Q) =βl(Q). Suppose that f∈L1(˜Q)is a nonnegative function,
1< p <∞,0< A <∞and0< ǫ≤ǫ0(n,p,α,β). Assume also that (3.2)holds
forQand(3.3)holds for Q′and˜Q. Then we have
|˜Q\Q′|1
p 
˜Q\Q′/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef−f˜Q\Q′/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≥c1·A,
wherec1=c1(n,p,α,β)is a positive constant.
Proof.From the assumptions of the lemma we get directly

enough, we have
C(n,p,α,β,ǫ )≥1

This completes the proof. /square
For the reader’s convenience, we start by giving a proof of Propos ition 3.1 in the
special case n= 1 as it is technically much simpler. The idea of the proof is the
same also in the multidimensional case.

and we get from Lemma 3.7 and the assumptions in Proposition 3.1 that
|Q1|1

Q1|f−fQ1| ≥c1A,
ifǫis small enough. Here c1=c1(n,p,α,β) withn= 1,α=2

and
deﬁneQ2:=˜Q\Q′=/bracketleftbig

, then we get from Lemma 3.7 that
|Q2|1
p 
Q2|f−fQ2| ≥c1A,
ifǫis small enough. Finally we notice that the distance between the cube sQ1and
Q2is1
3L. This completes the proof.

The case n≥2 is more complicated as the set ˜Q\Q′is usually not a cube.
Before the actual proof, we ﬁx some notation about directions an d projections.
3.8.Deﬁnition. Let{v1,...,v n}denote the standard orthonormal basis for Rn.
LetQ1⊂RnandQ2⊂Rnbe cubes. The cubes can be presented as Cartesian

the base vector vk. Fix an index kwith 1≤k≤n. If for every xk∈Pk(Q1) and
yk∈Pk(Q2) we have xk≤yk, then we say that Q2is located in direction ↑kfrom

wherec2=c2(n,p)is a positive constant.
Proof.Let us divide the cube ˜Qdyadically into 2nsubcubes. Then one of them
isQ′. Let us deﬁne Q0=/bracketleftbig2

simple to check that then
Q0⊂Q′

for every j. Also for every Qiwith 1≤i≤2n−2, there exists at least one cube

Now we are ready to prove Proposition 3.1.
Proof of Proposition 3.1 in the case n≥2.Let 0< ǫ≤ǫ0from Lemma 3.7 with
α=2
3andβ=4
3. We apply Lemma 3.9 2ntimes to each corner of Qand obtain
2nsets of cubes Q′,˜Qand¯Q. Here every ¯Qsatisﬁes (3.4) and (3.6). No matter
which corner the cubes Q′,Qand˜Qshare, we always have1
3Q⊂Q′. Since¯QandEQUALITY OF V JNpANDCJNp 11
Q′are disjoint, we get that ¯Qand1
3Qare also disjoint and thus each ¯Qis located
in at least one direction from1
3Qin the sense of Deﬁnition 3.8.
Because Q′is in the corner of ˜Q, there is one direction for each k∈ {1,2,...,n}
suchthat ¯Qcannotbelocatedinthatdirectionfrom1
3Q. Forexampleif Q= [0,L]n,
Q′= [0,2
3L]nand˜Q= [0,4
3L]n, thenthepossibledirectionswhere ¯Qmaybelocated
in from1
3Qare↑1,↑2, ... and ↑n. The cube ¯Qcannot be located in any of the
directions ↓1,↓2, ... and ↓nfrom1
3Q. Thus for each cube ¯Qthere are npossible
directions and for any two cubes ¯Qthe sets of possible directions do not coincide.
If one cube ¯Qis located in direction ↑kfrom1
3Qand another is located in
direction ↓k, then the distance between those two cubes is at least1
3l(Q) – thus the
proposition is true. Therefore let us assume by contradiction that no two cubes ¯Q
are located in opposite directions.
LetSbe the set of all directions in which all the cubes ¯Qare located from1
3Q.
Clearly then we have |S| ≤n, because by our assumption there is at most one
direction in Sfor each k∈ {1,2,...,n}. However there is always at least one cube
¯Qfor which the possible directions are all exactly opposite to the direc tions inS.
If for example the directions in Sare↑1,↑2, ... and ↑m, then there is no direction
inSfor the cube ¯Qfor which the possible directions are only ↓1,↓2, ... and ↓n.
This contradicts with the assumption that the directions of all ¯Qare represented in
S. Thus we conclude that there must be two cubes ¯Qin opposite directions. This
completes the proof. /square
Now we can show that the Morrey type integral (1.1) vanishes as th e measure
of the cube tends to inﬁnity.
3.12.Theorem. Let1< p <∞and suppose that f∈JNp(Rn). Then there is a
constant bsuch that
lim
a→∞sup
Q⊂Rn
l(Q)≥a|Q|1/p 
Q|f−b|= 0, (3.13)
where the supremum is taken over all cubes Q⊂Rnsuch that the side length of Q
is at least a.
Proof.Assume ﬁrst that f∈JNp(Rn)∩Lp,∞(Rn) andfis nonnegative. Let
lim
a→∞sup
Q⊂Rn
l(Q)≥a|Q|1/p 
Qf=A,
whereA≥0. The limit exists as this sequence is decreasing, the elements are
ﬁnite – this follows from Remark 2.2 because f∈Lp,∞(Rn) – and the sequence is
bounded from below by 0.
Let us assume that A >0. Let 0< ǫ≤ǫ0(n,p) as in Proposition3.1. Then there
exists a number N <∞such that (3.3) holds for every cube Qwherel(Q)≥N.
Also for any number M <∞there exists a cube Qsuch that l(Q)≥Mand
(3.2) holds. This means that we can ﬁnd a sequence of cubes ( Qi)∞
i=1such that
l(Q1)≥3

LetQibe one of these cubes. According to Proposition 3.1 there exist two cubes
Qi,1⊂3QiandQi,2⊂3Qithat satisfy (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6). The cubes ( Qi,1)∞
i=1
may not be pairwise disjoint. However for every cube Qiwe have two cubes to
choose from.
Let us construct a new sequence of cubes ( Q′
ij)∞
j=1iteratively. We start with
Qi1:=Q1and choose Q′
i1:=Q1,1. LetQi2,i2>1, be the smallest cube in the
sequence ( Qi)∞
i=1such that1
3l(Qi2)≥l(Q′
i1). Then at least one of the cubes Qi2,1
andQi2,2is pairwise disjoint with Q′
i1. Let’s say that Qi2,1is the disjoint one and
setQ′
i2:=Qi2,1.
Let us denote by Qthe smallest cube such that Q′
i1∪Q′
i2⊂Q. LetQi3,i3> i2,
be the smallest cube in the sequence ( Qi)∞
i=1such that1
3l(Qi3)≥l(Q). Then at
least one of the cubes Qi3,1andQi3,2is pairwise disjoint with both Q′
i1andQ′
i2.
By repeating this process and taking a subsequence of ( Qi)∞
i=1, if necessary, we
get inﬁnitely many pairwise disjoint cubes ( Q′
ij)∞
j=1. Then we get

This contradicts with the assumption that f∈JNp(Rn). Thus we conclude that
A= 0.
Now assume only that f∈JNp(Rn). From [15, Theorem 5.2] we get that there
is a constant bsuch that f−b∈Lp,∞(Rn). Obviously f−b∈JNp(Rn). Then from
(2.4) we get that |f−b| ∈JNp(Rn)∩Lp,∞(Rn). Finally by the same reasoning as
before, we conclude that
lim
a→∞sup
Q⊂Rn
l(Q)≥a|Q|1/p 
Q|f−b|= 0.
This completes the proof. /square
3.14.Remark. Naturally Theorem 3.12 implies that the result holds also for Lp
functions with p >1, but this can also be seen easily by considering the Hardy-
Littlewood maximal function. Indeed assume by contradiction that
lim
a→∞sup
Q⊂Rn
l(Q)≥a|Q|1
p 
Q|f|=A >0.
Then for any number a <∞there exists a cube Qsuch that l(Q)≥aand
|Q|1
p 
Q|f| ≥A
2.
Thus for every x∈Qwe have Mf(x)≥A
2|Q|−1
p, whereMfis the non-centered
Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. Thus Mf(x)/∈Lpand consequently f /∈Lp.
Clearly the theorem does not hold for weak Lpfunctions. For example let n= 1
andf(x) =x−1/p, whenx >0. Then we have f∈Lp,∞(R) but (3.13) does not
hold for any b. The same function shows us that Theorem 3.16 does not hold for
weakLpfunctions.
As a corollary from Theorem 3.12 we get that VJNpandCJNpcoincide. This
answers a question that was posed in [15] and it answers [17, Questio n 5.6] and [18,
Question 17].EQUALITY OF V JNpANDCJNp 13
3.15.Corollary. Let1< p <∞. ThenCJNp(Rn) =VJNp(Rn).
Proof.It is clear that CJNp⊆VJNp. Letf∈VJNp⊂JNp. Then we get from
Theorem 3.12 that there is a constant bsuch that
lim
a→∞sup
Q⊂Rn
l(Q)≥a|Q|1/p 
Q|f−fQ|= lim
a→∞sup
Q⊂Rn
l(Q)≥a|Q|1/p 
Q|f−b−(f−b)Q|
≤lim
a→∞sup
Q⊂Rn
l(Q)≥a|Q|1/p2 
Q|f−b|= 0.
Then by Theorem 2.12 we get that f∈CJNp. This completes the proof. /square
From the following result we can infer that the additional condition in [ 15,
Lemma 5.8] is not necessary, answering the question posed in [15].
3.16.Theorem. LetX⊆Rnbe either a bounded cube or the entire space Rnand
1< p <∞. Suppose that f∈JNp(X). Then
lim
a→0sup
Q⊆X
l(Q)≤a|Q|1/p 
Q|f|= 0, (3.17)
where the supremum is taken over all cubes Q⊆X, such that the side length of Q
is at most a.
3.18.Remark. The theorem implies that Lpfunctions also satisfy (3.17). However
in that case the result is well known as it follows simply from H¨ older’s ine quality
and the dominated convergence theorem. Notice that for Lpfunctions (3.17) holds
also when p= 1, whereas in Remark 3.14 it is necessary that p >1.
3.19.Remark. In particular this result implies that for any 1 < p <∞and bounded
cubeX⊂Rn, the John-Nirenberg space JNp(X) is a subspace of the vanishing
Morrey space VL1,n−n
p(X) as deﬁned in [12].
Proof of Theorem 3.16. OtherwisetheproofissimilartotheproofofTheorem3.12,
but we have to take into account the possibility that we might have 3 Q/\e}atio\slash⊆X, even
thoughQ⊆X.
Letf∈JNp(X). Let us assume ﬁrst that fis nonnegative and f∈Lp,∞(X).
Let
lim
a→0sup
Q⊆X
l(Q)≤a|Q|1/p 
Qf=A. (3.20)
The limit exists as the sequence is decreasing and bounded from below by 0.
Assume that A >0. Let 0 < ǫ≤ǫ0(n,p) as in Proposition 3.1. Then there is a
numberδ >0 such that (3.3) holds for any cube Qwherel(Q)≤δ. Also because of
(3.20) we know that for every a >0 there exists a cube Q⊆Xsuch that l(Q)≤a
and (3.2) holds for Q. Therefore we can ﬁnd a sequence of cubes ( Qi)∞
i=1such that
l(Q1)≤3
4δ,l(Qi+1)< l(Qi), limi→∞l(Qi) = 0 and
|Qi|1/p 
Qif≥A(1−ǫ).
for every i≥1.
Case 1: There are inﬁnitely many cubes Qiin the sequence such that 3 Qi⊆X.14 R. KORTE AND T. TAKALA
By takinga subsequencewe mayassumethat 3 Qi⊆Xforevery i. LetQibe one
of these cubes. Then according to Proposition 3.1 there exist two c ubesQi,1⊂3Qi
andQi,2⊂3Qithat satisfy (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6). The cubes ( Qi,1)∞
i=1may not be
pairwise disjoint. However for every cube Qiwe have two cubes to choose from.
Let us construct a new sequence of cubes ( Q′
ij)∞
j=1iteratively. We start with
Qi1:=Q1. Then there exist inﬁnitely many cubes Qiin the sequence such that
Q1,1∩3Qi=∅for every iorQ1,2∩3Qi=∅for every i. This is true because
dist(Q1,1,Q1,2)≥l(Q1)/3 and lim i→∞l(Qi) = 0. Without loss of generality we
may assume that Q1,1∩3Qi=∅for inﬁnitely many i >1. We set Q′
i1:=Q1,1.
LetQi2,i2>1, be the ﬁrst cube in the sequence ( Qi)∞
i=1such that Q′
i1∩3Qi2=∅.
Then the cubes Q′
i1,Qi2,1andQi2,2are all pairwise disjoint. Thus we can continue
by choosing one of the cubes Qi2,1andQi2,2such that there are still inﬁnitely many
cubes 3Qi,i > i2, that are pairwise disjoint with both the chosen cube and Q′
i1.
By repeating this process and taking a subsequence of ( Qi)∞
i=1, if necessary, we
get inﬁnitely many pairwise disjoint cubes ( Q′
ij)∞
j=1inXthat all satisfy (3.6).
Case 2: There are only ﬁnitely many cubes Qiin the sequence such that 3 Qi⊆
X. This can only happen if Xis a bounded cube. In this case we shall also
construct a new sequence of pairwise disjoint cubes ( Q′
ij)∞
j=1iteratively. By taking
a subsequenceof ( Qi)∞
i=1we mayassume that l(Q1)≤1
4l(X) andl(Qi+1)≤2
9l(Qi).
Assume that 3 Qi/\e}atio\slash⊂X. Then we know that for any k∈ {1,2,...,n}the projection
Pk(3Qi) can only intersect one of the endpoints of Pk(X). Letmbe the number of
base vectors vksuch that Pk(3Qi)⊂Pk(X). Then 0 ≤m < nand there exist 2m
cubes¯Qi⊂X∩3Qi\1
3Qias they are deﬁned in Lemma 3.9.
Every such cube ¯Qiis located in some direction from the cube1
3Qi, in a similar
way as in the proof of Proposition 3.1. Without loss of generality we ma y assume
that the possible directions for these cubes are ↑1,↓1,↑2,↓2, ...,↑m,↓m,↓m+1,
↓m+2, ...,↓n, but for each ¯Qithere is naturally only one possible direction for each
k∈ {1,2,...,n}. If one of the cubes is located in direction ↑kand another is in
direction ↓k,k≤m, then the distance between these two cubes is at least1
3l(Qi).
Thus we can choose one of these cubes into the sequence ( Q′
ij)∞
j=1the same way
as in the ﬁrst case and there are still inﬁnitely many cubes Ql,l > i, such that
3Ql∩¯Qi=∅.
Let us assume that there are no two cubes ¯Qithat are located in opposite
directions from1
3Qi. Then by similar reasoning as in the proof of Proposition 3.1,
we know that at least one of the cubes ¯Qimust be located in direction ↓kfor some
k > m. Let us denote such a cube by Qi,1. If there are inﬁnitely many cubes
Ql,l > i, such that 3 Ql∩Qi,1=∅, then we may choose Qi,1into the sequence
(Q′
ij)∞
j=1.
Assume that there are only ﬁnitely many cubes Ql,l > i, such that 3 Ql∩Qi,1=
∅. Then there are inﬁnitely many cubes Ql,l > i, such that 3 Ql∩Qi,1/\e}atio\slash=∅. Let
Qlbe one of these cubes. Because l(Ql)≤2
9l(Qi), we know that Pk(3Ql)⊂Pk(X).
This is because the distance from Pk(Qi,1) to∂Pk(X) is at least2
3l(Qi).
In addition for every 1 ≤s≤mwe have Ps(3Ql)⊂Ps(X). This is because
of how the cube ¯Qwas chosen in Lemma 3.9. Because the cube Qi,1is located
in direction ↓kfrom the cube1
3Qi, we have either Qi,1⊂˜Qi(where˜Qiis as in
Lemma 3.9) or the projection of ˜Qiand the projection of Qi,1coincide for every
base vector except vk. ThusPs(Qi,1)⊂Ps(˜Qi). Because Ps(3Qi)⊂Ps(X) forEQUALITY OF V JNpANDCJNp 15
every 1≤s≤m, we get that the distance from Ps(˜Qi) to∂Ps(X) is at least
2
3l(Qi). See Figure 2 to get a better understanding of the situation.

may be situated with respect to each other. In the picture we have
the projections of these cubes to the mk-plane. The cube Qi,1is
located in direction ↓kfrom1
3Qi. Therefore we have either Qi,1as
shown in the picture or Qi,1⊂˜Qi.
In conclusion if 3 Qi/\e}atio\slash⊂Xand there are mbase vectors vssuch that Ps(3Qi)⊂
Ps(X), then we can ﬁnd a cube Qi,1⊂X∩3Qisuch that (3.6) holds and there are
inﬁnitely many cubes Ql,l > i, suchthat Qi,1∩3Ql=∅, or, if the ﬁrst option isnot
possible, there exist inﬁnitely many cubes Ql,l > i, such that Ps(3Ql)⊂Ps(X) for
at leastm+1 base vectors vs. Because there are only nbase vectors in total, this
latter option can only happen at most ntimes. Thus we can always ﬁnd inﬁnitely
many pairwise disjoint cubes ( Q′

j=1inXthat all satisfy (3.6).

Thiscontradictswith the fact that f∈JNp(X). Thereforeweconclude that A= 0.
Now assume only that f∈JNp(X). Then there is a constant bsuch that
f−b∈Lp,∞(X). Also from (2.4) we get that |f−b| ∈JNp(X)∩Lp,∞(X). Then
using the same argument as earlier we get
