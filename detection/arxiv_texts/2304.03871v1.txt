ABSTRACT
Aims. We inspect 4 microlensing events KMT-2021-BLG-1968, KMT-2 021-BLG-2010, KMT-2022-BLG-0371, and KMT-2022-BLG-1013 , for
which the light curves exhibit partially covered short-ter m central anomalies. We conduct detailed analyses of the eve nts with the aim of revealing
the nature of the anomalies.
Methods. We test various models that can give rise to the anomalies of t he individual events including the binary-lens (2L1S) and b inary-source
(1L2S) interpretations. Under the 2L1S interpretation, we thoroughly inspect the parameter space to check the existen ce of degenerate solutions,
and if they exist, we test the feasibility of resolving the de generacy.
Results. We ﬁnd that the anomalies in KMT-2021-BLG-2010 and KMT-2022 -BLG-1013 are uniquely deﬁned by planetary-lens interpret ations
with the planet-to-host mass ratios of q∼2.8×10−3and∼1.6×10−3, respectively. For KMT-2022-BLG-0371, a planetary soluti on with a mass ratio
q∼4×10−4is strongly favored over the other three degenerate 2L1S sol utions with diﬀerent mass ratios based on the χ2and relative proper motion
arguments, and a 1L2S solution is clearly ruled out. For KMT- 2021-BLG-1968, on the other hand, we ﬁnd that the anomaly can be explained either
by a planetary or a binary-source interpretation, making it diﬃcult to ﬁrmly identify the nature of the anomaly. From the Bay esian analyses of the
identiﬁed planetary events, we estimate that the masses of t he planet and host are ( Mp/MJ,Mh/M⊙)=(1.07+1.15
−0.68,0.37+0.40
−0.23), (0.26+0.13
−0.11,0.63+0.32
−0.28),
and (0.31+0.46
−0.16,0.18+0.28
−0.10) for KMT-2021-BLG-2010L, KMT-2022-BLG-0371L, and KMT-20 22-BLG-1013L, respectively.

1. Introduction
Current planetary microlensing experiments are being carr ied
out with the use of multiple wide ﬁeld telescopes. With the hi gh
observational cadence achieved by employing large-format cam-
eras and continuous coverage using multiple telescopes, th e ex-
periments aim to construct a large planet sample including t er-
restrial planets. The microlensing planet sample is of scie ntiﬁc
importance in studying the demographic distribution of pla nets
because it includes planet populations to which the detecti on ef-
ﬁciency of other major planet detection methods is low, for e x-
ample, cold planets with faint host stars.
Despite the enhanced observational cadence of the current
microlensing surveys, the coverage for a fraction of planet -
induced signals can be incomplete, especially for those wit h
short durations. The most common cause for the incomplete co v-
erage is a bad weather. In the case of the Korea Microlensing
Telescope Network (KMTNet: Kim et al. 2016 ) experiment, its
three telescopes are located in the three continents of the S outh-
ern Hemisphere including the Siding Spring Observatory in A us-
tralia (KMTA), the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in
Chile (KMTC), and the South African Astronomical Observa-tory in South Africa (KMTS). If one of these telescope sites i s
clouded out, the coverage of a signal with a duration /lessorsimilar1 day pro-
duced by a low-mass planet would be incomplete. Another caus e
for the incomplete anomaly coverage is that a subset of surve y
ﬁelds are observed with a relatively low cadence. The observ a-
tional cadence for the peripheral ﬁelds of the KMTNet survey
is 4–20 times lower than the 0.25 hr cadence of the prime ﬁelds ,
and thus the coverage of a short-duration signal detected in these
low-cadence ﬁelds can be incomplete, for example, the plan-
etary events KMT-2017-BLG-0673 and KMT-2019-BLG-0414
(Han et al. 2022a ). Besides, the coverage of signals detected in
the early or late phase of a bulge season can also be incom-
plete, for example, the two-planet event OGLE-2019-BLG-04 68
(Han et al. 2022b ), due to fact that the target, respectively, rises
and sets close to twilight.
In this paper, we present the analyses of 4 microlensing
events KMT-2021-BLG-1968, KMT-2021-BLG-2010, KMT-
2022-BLG-0371, and KMT-2022-BLG-1013, for which the light
curves of the events exhibit partially covered short-term c entral
anomalies. With the aim of revealing the nature of the anomal ies,
we conduct detailed analyses of the events under various int er-

pretations that can give rise to the anomalies of the individ ual
events.
We present the analyses of the events according to the fol-
lowing organization. In Sect. 2, we describe the acquisition and
reduction procedure of the data used in the analyses. In Sect .3,
we depict the models tested for the interpretations of the an oma-
lies, and introduce parameters used in the modeling. In the s ub-
sequent subsections, we present the detailed analyses cond ucted
for the events KMT-2021-BLG-1968 (Sect. 3.1), KMT-2021-
BLG-2010 (Sect. 3.2), KMT-2022-BLG-0371 (Sect. 3.3), and
KMT-2022-BLG-1013 (Sect. 3.4). Based on these analyses, we
judge whether the anomalies are of planetary origin or not. I n
Sect. 4, we specify the source stars of the events by estimating
the colors and magnitudes, and estimate angular Einstein ra dii.
In Sect. 5, we estimate the physical parameters of the mass and
distance to the identiﬁed planetary system. We summarize re -
sults in Sect. 6.
2. Observations and data
All the lensing events analyzed this work were detected in th e
2021 and 2022 seasons by the KMTNet survey from the mon-
itoring of stars lying toward the Galactic bulge ﬁeld. The th ree
telescopes used by the KMTNet survey are identical, and each
1.6 m telescope is equipped with a camera yielding 4 deg2ﬁeld
of view. Since July 2020, the MAP & µFUN Follow-up teams
have been conducting a long-term follow-up program for high -
magniﬁcation events ( Zang et al. 2021 ). For the two very high-
magniﬁcation events KMT-2022-BLG-0371 and KMT-2022-
BLG-1013, observations were additionally conducted using the
1 m telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory global network
at CTIO (LCOC) and SAAO (LCOS) for both KMT-2022-BLG-
0371 and KMT-2022-BLG-1013, and using the 0.4 m telescope
at the Auckland Observatory in New Zealand for KMT-2022-
BLG-1013. KMTNet also went into "followup mode" and in-
creased its observational cadence over the peaks of these tw o
high-magniﬁcation events. Images from the KMTNet survey an d
MAP followup observations were mostly acquired in the Iband,
and a fraction of KMTNet images were obtained in the Vband
for the source color measurement. The Auckland Observatory
data were taken in the Wratten #12 ﬁlter.
Image reductions and source star photometry of the KMT-
Net, LCO, and Auckland data were done with the use of the
pySIS pipeline developed by Albrow et al. (2009 ) and Yang
et al. (in prep) on the basis of the di ﬀerence image method
(Tomaney & Crotts 1996 ;Alard & Lupton 1998 ). The error bars
of data estimated by the individual photometry codes were re ad-
justed following the Yee et al. (2012 ) routine in order that they
are consistent with the scatter of data and χ2per degree of free-
dom (dof) for each data set becomes unity.
3. Analyses
The anomalies in the lensing light curves of the events analy zed
in this work were identiﬁed from the visual inspection of the
microlensing data collected during the 2021 and 2022 season s.
The common characteristic of the events and the anomalies ap -
pearing in their lensing light curves is that the peak magniﬁ ca-
tions of the events are very high, with Apeak∼100, 60, 570, and
280 for KMT-2021-BLG-1968, KMT-2021-BLG-2010, KMT-
2022-BLG-0371, and KMT-2022-BLG-1013, respectively, and
the anomalies appear near the peaks of the light curves. Ther e
are three channels that can produce such central anomalies, in-
cluding the planetary, binary-lens, and binary-source cha nnels.A central anomaly through the planetary channel arises when
a source star passes through the central anomaly region form ed
around the tiny caustic induced by a planetary companion to t he
primary lens. A planetary companion induces two sets of caus -
tics, in which one (central caustic) forms near the position of the
planet host ( Chung et al. 2005 ), and the other (planetary caustic)
forms away from the host at a position ∼s−1/s(Han 2006 ),
where sdenotes the host-planet separation vector with its length
scaled to the angular Einstein radius θE. Then, the chance for
the peak region of a high-magniﬁcation event, resulting fro m the
close approach of the source to the planet host, being pertur bed
by a planet is very high ( Griest & Saﬁzadeh 1998 ).
A binary lens with roughly equal mass components can also
induce a central anomaly. In the binary case, a single causti c
forms near the barycenter of a close binary lens with s≪1,
while two caustics form near the positions of the individual lens
components of a wide binary lens with s≫1. Then, the chance
of the central perturbation of a high-magniﬁcation event re sult-
ing from the close approach of the source either to the baryce nter
of the close binary or to each of the wide lens components of a
wide binary is high ( Han & Hwang 2009 ).
A central anomaly can also arise when the closely spaced
components of a binary source successively approach the len s.
In this case, the resulting light curve is the superposition of those
of the events involved with the individual source stars, and the
combined magniﬁcations can appear to be anomalous.
We analyze the individual lensing events by modeling the
light curves under the planetary, binary-lens, and binary- source
interpretations. In each modeling, we search for a lensing s o-
lution, which speciﬁes a set of lensing parameters depictin g the
lensing light curve. In the simplest case of a lensing event i nvolv-
ing a single lens and a single source (1L1S), the lensing ligh t
curve is described by 3 basic lensing parameters of ( t0,u0,tE),
which denote the time of the source star’s closest approach t o
the lens, the lens-source separation (impact parameters) a t that
time, and the Einstein time scale, respectively. The impact pa-
rameter is scaled to θE, and the Einstein time scale is deﬁned
as the time for the source to transit the Einstein radius. In t he
planetary and binary-lens cases, the lens system is compose d of
two lens masses and a single source (2L1S), and the inclusion
of an extra lens component requires including additional pa ram-
eters to depict the lens binarity. These additional paramet ers are
(s,q,α), and the ﬁrst two parameters denote the projected separa-
tion (normalized to θE) and mass ratio between the lens compo-
nents, respectively, and the last one represents the angle b etween
the source trajectory and the binary-lens axis (source traj ectory
angle). In the binary-source case, the lens system comprise s a
single lens and two source stars (1L2S), and the addition of
the extra source requires including three additional param eters
(t0,2,u0,2,qF), which denote the approach time and impact pa-
rameter of the source companion, and the ﬂux ratio between th e
two source stars, respectively ( Hwang et al. 2013 ). In all tested
models, we include an additional parameter ρ, which is deﬁned
as the ratio of the angular source radius to θE(normalized source
radius), for the consideration of ﬁnite-source e ﬀects, which may
aﬀect the lensing light curves of high-magniﬁcation events wh en
the lens passes over the surface of a source or a central caust ic.
In the 1L2S model, there are two source stars, and we denote th e
normalized radius of the secondary source as ρ2. In the follow-
ing subsections, we explain the detailed procedure of model ing
conducted for the individual events.

3.1. KMT -2021-BLG-1968
The event KMT-2021-BLG-1968 occurred on a source lying
at the Equatorial coordinates (RA, DEC) J2000=(17:52:25.77,
-28:09:05.87), which correspond to the Galactic coordinat es
(l,b)=(1◦.443,−0◦.878). The source position corresponds to
the KMTNet prime ﬁelds of BLG02 and BLG42, toward which
observations were conducted with a 0.5 hr cadence for each
ﬁeld, and a 0.25 hr in combination. The extinction toward the
ﬁeld, AI∼4.1, was high due to the closeness of the ﬁeld to
the Galactic center. Together with the faintness of the sour ce,
the measurement of the source baseline was di ﬃcult, but the
source was registered in the Dark Energy Camera (DECam)
catalog with an i-band baseline magnitude of ibase=21.83.
The KMTNet alert of the event was issued on 2021 August 2,
which corresponds to the abridged heliocentric Julian data of
HJD′≡HJD−2450000=9428. The event reached its peak
a day after the alert at HJD′=9429.8 with a peak magnitude
ofIpeak∼17.4. The event was observed solely by the KMTNet
survey without any followup observations.Fig. 2. Light curve KMT-2021-BLG-1968 in the region of the anomaly.
The curves drawn over the data points are 2L1S, 1L2S, and PSPL mod-
els and the lower four panels show the residuals from the indi vidual
models. The three insets in the top panel shows the lens syste m conﬁg-
urations of the close and wide 2L1S solutions and the 1L2S sol ution.
For each 2L1S conﬁguration, the cuspy red ﬁgure represents t he caus-
tic and the arrowed line indicates the source trajectory. Fo r the 1L2S
conﬁguration, the small ﬁlled dot represents the lens posit ion and the
arrowed lines marked in red and blue represent the trajector ies of the
primary and secondary source stars, respectively.
The light curve of KMT-2021-BLG-1968 is displayed in Fig-
ure1, in which the lower panel shows the whole view and the
upper panel shows the peak region of the light curve. The curv e
drawn over the data points is a point-source point-lens (PSP L)
model. It shows that a short-term anomaly with about 1 day dur a-
tion occurred near the peak of the light curve. The residual f rom
the PSPL model presented in the bottom panel of Figure 2shows
that negative and positive deviations occurred in the risin g and
falling parts, respectively. The time gap between the anoma ly
regions covered by the KMTC and KMTS data sets corresponds
to the night time of the KMTA site, but observations at the Aus -
tralian site could not be done due to bad weather.

modeling of KMT-2021-BLG-1968. The right panel shows the en large-
ment of the map around the local minima. Colors are assigned t o repre-
sent points with∆χ2≤1nσ(red),≤2nσ(yellow),≤3nσ(green), and
≤4nσ(cyan), where n=3.
For the interpretation of the anomaly, we ﬁrst conducted
a 2L1S modeling of the light curve. Figure 3shows the∆χ2
map obtained from the grid searches for the binary lens param -
eters sandq. The map shows a unique pair of local minima at
(logs,logq)∼(±0.2,−2.5) resulting from the close-wide de-
generacy ( Dominik 1999 ;An 2005 ). In Table 1, we list the full
lensing parameters of the close ( s<1) and wide ( s>1) 2L1S
solutions obtained after reﬁning the solutions by allowing all pa-
rameters to vary. The degeneracy between the solutions is ve ry
severe with∆χ2<1. For both solutions, the estimated mass ra-
tios between the lens components, q∼3.1×10−3, are very small,
indicating that the companion to the lens is a planet accordi ng to
the 2L1S interpretation. The model curve (solid curve) of th e
close planetary solution is drawn over the data points in the top
panel of Figure 2, and the residuals of both the close and wide
solutions are presented in the lower panels. The lens system con-
ﬁgurations of the close and wide 2L1S solutions are presente d in
the left two insets of the top panel of Figure 2. It shows that
the anomaly was produced by the source passage through the
anomaly region extending from the protruding cusp of the cen -
tral caustic induced by a planetary companion. The measured
event time scale is tE∼20 days. The normalized source radius
cannot be accurately measured due to the non-caustic-cross ing
nature of the anomaly, and only the upper limit ρmax∼4×10−3
is constrained.
We check the feasibility of explaining the anomaly with the
introduction of a source companion by additionally conduct ing
a 1L2S modeling. The lensing parameters of the best-ﬁt 1L2S
solution are listed in Table 1. The fact that qF∼0.12 indicates
that the secondary source is fainter than the primary source , and
the fact that t0<t0,2andu0<u0,2indicates the secondary
source trailed the primary source and approached closer to t he
lens than the primary source. The model curve (dotted curve)
and the residual of the binary-source solution together wit h the
conﬁguration of the 1L2S lens system are presented in Fig-
ure1. In principle, binary source models sometimes show mea-
surable color-dependent e ﬀects, for example, MOA-2012-BLG-
486 ( Hwang et al. 2013 ). However, because of the high extinc-
tion, the event is too faint in the V-band to carry out such tests.Fig. 4. Light curve of KMT-2021-BLG-2010. The layout and scheme
of the plots are same as those of Fig. 1.

We ﬁnd that the observed anomaly in the lensing light curve
is almost equally well explained with the planetary and bina ry-
source interpretations. From the comparison of the ﬁts, it i s
found that the planetary solution is preferred over the bina ry-
source solution by a mere ∆χ2=3.0. We note that resolving
the degeneracy between the planetary and binary-source sol u-
tions would be diﬃcult even if the gap between the KMTC and
KMTS data sets had been covered by the KMTA data because
the two models in the gap region are almost identical.
3.2. KMT -2021-BLG-2010
The lensing event KMT-2021-BLG-2010 occurred on a source
lying at (RA,DEC) J2000=(17:52:02.04, -32:16:11.10), ( l,b)=
(−2◦.148,−2◦.899), toward which the I-band extinction is AI∼
2.1. The source lies in the KMTNet prime ﬁeld of BLG41 and
the sub-prime ﬁeld BLG22, toward which the combined obser-
vational cadence is 0.33 hr. The event was observed solely by
the KMTNet group, who issued the alert of the event on 2021
August 03 (HJD′=9429) at around the time when the event
reached its peak.
In Figure 4, we present the light curve of KMT-2021-BLG-
2010. The light curve is constructed with the use of only the
KMTC and KMTS data sets because the photometry quality of
the KMTA data set is not good. It is found that the light curve
exhibits an anomaly appearing around the peak with an approx -

imate duration of 1 day, and the deviation from the PSPL model
appears both in the rising and falling parts as shown in the PS PL
residual presented in the bottom panel of Figure 5. Similar to the
case of KMT-2021-BLG-1968, the coverage of the anomaly is
incomplete due to the absence of the KMTA data set1.
We ﬁnd that the anomaly of the event is uniquely explained
by a pair of planetary models. In Figure 6, we present the∆χ2
map obtained from the grid searches for the binary parameter s
sandq. The estimated binary parameters are (log s,logq)∼

they proved to be unusable due to bad observing conditions.Fig. 7. Light curve of KMT-2022-BLG-0371.
(±0.06,−2.6), indicating that the anomaly was produced by a
planetary companion and the two solutions result from the cl ose-
wide degeneracy. The ﬁnal lensing parameters of the close an d
wide planetary solutions are listed in Table 2, and the model
curve of the close 2L1S solution is drawn over the data points
in the top panel of Figure 5, and the residuals from both the
close and wide 2L1S solutions are shown in the lower panels.
We also present the lens system conﬁgurations of the close an d
wide 2L1S solutions in the insets of the top panel. According to
the solutions, the anomaly was produced by the source passag e
through the negative deviation region formed in the back-en d re-
gion of the central caustic induced by a planet. The source di d
not cross the caustic, and thus only the upper limit of the nor -
malized source radius, ρmax∼5×10−3, is constrained.
We ﬁnd that the planetary and binary-source models can be
distinguished with a high conﬁdence level of ∆χ2=62.7. The
model curve and the residual of the best-ﬁt 1L2S solution are
presented in Figure 5, showing that the model results in a poor
ﬁt especially in the region 9429 .2/lessorsimilarHJD′/lessorsimilar9429.5, that was
covered by the KMTS data set.
3.3. KMT -2022-BLG-0371
The source of the lensing event KMT-2022-BLG-0371 lies
at (RA,DEC) J2000=(17:41:26.86, -34:41:55.21), ( l,b)=
(−5◦.372,−2◦.267). The I-band extinction toward the ﬁeld is AI=
2.18. The event was found on 2022 April 11 (HJD′=9680),
when the source became brighter than the baseline magnitude
ofIbase=19.72 by 0.45 mag. The source location corresponds
to the KMTNet sub-prime ﬁeld BLG37, toward which observa-
tions were carried out with a 2.5 hr cadence. The event reache d
its peak at HJD′=9689.4 with a very a high magniﬁcation
ofAmax∼570. Four days before the event reached the peak
(HJD′=9685.27), a high-magniﬁcation alert was issued by the
KMTNet HighMagFinder system ( Yang et al. 2022 ). In response
to this alert, two days before the peak, follow-up observati ons
were conducted using the LCOC and LCOS telescopes and the
cadence of KMTNet observations was increased. The magniﬁ-

vations over the peak, the standard KMTNet cadence of 2.5 hr
(∼0.1 days) for the BLG37 ﬁeld would not have been su ﬃcient
to accurately characterize the anomaly.
We ﬁnd that the anomaly in the lensing light curve is de-
scribed by multiple sets of local solutions with di ﬀerent combi-
nations of log sand log q, as shown in the∆χ2map presented in
Figure 9. We identify 4 close-wide pairs of solutions, which we
designate as "Sol A", "Sol B", "Sol C" and "Sol D". The reﬁned
lensing parameters of the individual solutions are present ed in
Tables 4(for solutions A and B) and 5(for solutions C and D).
For the solutions A and B, the mass ratio between the lens com-
ponents are qA∼0.05 and qB∼0.02, respectively, and thus the
companion would likely be a brown dwarf according to these so -
lutions. On the other hand, the mass ratios of the solutions C and
D are qC∼0.8×10−3andqD∼0.4×10−3, respectively, and
thus the companion is a planet according to these solutions. In
Figure 8, we present the model curve of the best-ﬁt 2L1S model
(close Sol D solution) and the close model residuals of all lo cal
solutions. In Figure 10, we present the lens system conﬁgura-
tions of the individual local solutions. We reject the 1L2S i nter-
pretation of the anomaly because the 1L2S model yields a poor er
ﬁt than the 2L1S solution by ∆χ2=176.6.
We ﬁnd that the solution D is strongly favored over the other
2L1S solutions by a combination of two arguments. First, the
solution D yields a better ﬁt by ∆χ2=7.8, 7.7, and 9.5 than
the solutions A, B, and C, respectively. Second, the solutio n DFig. 11. Scatter plot of points in the MCMC chain on the πE,N–πE,E

results in a higher probability of the relative lens-source mo-
tionµthan those of the other solutions. According to Eq. (22)
ofGould (2022 ), the relative probability for a proper motion
of a lensing event to be less than an observed value µobsis
p(µ<µ obs)=(µobs/6 mas yr−1)2in the regime of low proper
motions. In Table 5, we summarize the values of the normalized
source radiusρ, angular source radius θ∗, angular Einstein radius
θE=θ∗/ρ, event time scale tE, proper motionµ=θE/tE, and the
resulting probabilities p(µ<µ obs) for the individual local 2L1S
solutions. The detailed procedure of estimating θ∗is described
in Sect. 4. From the comparison of the probabilities, it is found
that the solution D is at least 4 times more probable than any o f
the other solutions. While each of the two arguments based on
χ2andµis not compelling by itself, together they strongly favor
the solution D, although the other solutions are not complet ely
ruled out. We note that direct measurement of the proper moti on
by resolving the lens and source from future high-resolutio n fol-
lowup observations can ultimately lift the degeneracy amon g the
local solutions.
It is found that reliable measurements of the parallax param -
eters (πE,N,πE,E) are diﬃcult despite the long time scale of the
event. This is shown in the scatter plot of ∆χ2on theπE,N–πE,E
plane presented in Figure 11. The scatter plot shows that the par-
allax solution is not only consistent with a zero- πEmodel but
also the uncertainty of πE, especially the north component, is
very big.

3.4. KMT -2022-BLG-1013
The event KMT-2022-BLG-1013, occurred on a bulge star
with coordinates (RA ,DEC) J2000=(17:38:50.22, -28:21:20.41),
(l,b)=(−0◦.291,1◦.570), was detected in its early stage by the
KMTNet survey on 2022 May 31 (HJD′∼9729.7). The baseline
magnitude registered in the DECam catalog is ibase=21.31, and
the extinction toward the ﬁeld is AI∼3.1. The source was in
the KMTNet BLG14 ﬁeld, toward which normal-mode observa-
tions were done with a 1.0 hr cadence. At HJD′=9736.89, the
KMTNet HighMagFinder system issued an alert that this event
was peaking at a high magniﬁcation. Then, the peak region of
the light curve was covered by the KMTS data with an intensi-
ﬁed cadence of 0.12 hr during the period of 9737 .30≤HJD′≤
9737.65, and additional data were acquired from followup obser-
vations conducted using the LCOC, LCOS, and Auckland tele-
scopes.
The light curve of KMT-2022-BLG-1013 is presented in Fig-
ure12. For the construction of the light curve, we did not use
the KMTA data set due to its poor photometric quality. In any
case, there were no KMTA data taken near peak. The peak re-
gion appears to exhibit deviations caused by ﬁnite-source e f-
fects, and thus we ﬁrst ﬁtted the light curve with a FSPL model .
It is found that the FSPL model approximately describes the
peak, but it leaves substantial positive residuals of ∼0.1 mag
level in both the rising (9734 /lessorsimilarHJD′/lessorsimilar9736) and fallingFig. 13. Zoom of the central anomaly region of KMT-2022-BLG-1013.
The lower 5 panels show the residuals from the 3 degenerate 2L 1S (so-
lutions A, B, and C), 1L2S, and FSPL models. The three insets i n the

(9738/lessorsimilarHJD′/lessorsimilar9740) sides, as shown in the bottom panel
of Figure 13.
From the through inspection of the parameter space, it is
found that the residuals from the FSPL model are explained by a
unique planetary model. Figure 14shows the∆χ2map obtained
from the 2L1S grid searches for the binary-lens parameters s
andq. We identify 4 local solutions, designated as "Sol A c",
"Sol A w", "Sol B", and "Sol C", and the locations of the indi-
vidual locals are marked in the log s–log qparameter plane pre-
sented in Figure 14. We note that the locals Sol A cand Sol A w
are the pair of solutions resulting from the close-wide dege ner-
acy. In Table 6, we list the reﬁned lensing parameters of the in-
dividual local solutions, and the corresponding lens-syst em con-
ﬁgurations are presented in the insets of the top panel of Fig -
ure13. We note that the Sol A cand Sol A wsolutions result in
similar conﬁgurations, and thus we present the conﬁguratio n of
the Sol A csolution as a representative one. The residuals from
the individual models are presented in the lower 4 panels of F ig-
ure13. From the comparison of the residuals and the χ2values
of the models, it is found that the Sol C model yields a substan -
tially better ﬁt to the data than the other models, by ∆χ2=42.8,

44.4, and 29.0 with respect to Sol A c, Sol A w, and Sol B models,
respectively. We also ﬁnd that the Sol C model is preferred ov er
the 1L2S model by ∆χ2=50.7.
According to the best-ﬁt model, the mass ratio between the
lens components is q∼1.6×10−3, indicating that the companion
to the lens is a planet. The projected separation, s∼1.07, is very
close to unity, and thus the planet induces a resonant causti c. The
anomaly was produced by the successive caustic crossings of the
source, which entered the caustic by crossing the upper fold of
the caustic at HJD′∼9734.6, passed through the inner caustic
region, and then exited the caustic by going through the stro ng
lower cusp of the caustic at HJD′∼9738.9. According to the
solution, the positive deviation in the rising part of the an omaly
is explained by the source crossing over the upper fold caust ic,
and the positive deviation in the falling part is explained b y the
source passage through the positive anomaly region extendi ng
from the strong caustic cusp.
4. Source stars and Einstein radii
In this section, we specify the source stars of the events. Th e
main purpose of the source speciﬁcation is estimating the an gu-
lar Einstein radius of the planetary lens event from the meas ured
normalized source radius by the relation
θE=θ∗
ρ, (1)
where the angular source radius θ∗is deduced from the source
type. We are able to measure the Einstein radii of the two even ts
KMT-2022-BLG-0371 and KMT-2022-BLG-1013, for which
the lenses are identiﬁed as planetary systems and the ρvalues
are measured. Although the lens of KMT-2021-BLG-2010 is a
planetary system, the Einstein radius cannot be measured be -
cause theρvalue is not measured. In the case of KMT-2021-
BLG-1968, neither is the lens uniquely identiﬁed as a planet ary
system nor is the ρvalue measured. Nevertheless, we specify
the source stars of all events for fully characterizing the l ensing
events.
We speciﬁed the source star of each event by measuring its
de-reddened color ( V−I)S,0and magnitude I0using the Yoo et al.Fig. 15. Source locations (ﬁlled blue dots) of the events in the instr u-
mental color-magnitude diagrams of stars around the source stars. In
each panel, the ﬁlled red dot denotes the centroid of the red g iant clump.
(2004 ) routine. Following the routine, we ﬁrst measured the
instrumental color and magnitude, ( V−I,I)S, of the source,
placed the source in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of
stars around the source, measured the o ﬀset∆(V−I,I) of the
source position from the centroid of the red giant clump (RGC ),
with ( V−I,I)RGC, in the CMD, and then estimate the de-
reddened source color and magnitude as
(V−I,I)S,0=(V−I,I)RGC,0+∆(V−I,I). (2)
Here ( V−I,I)RGC,0denote the known values of the de-reddened
color and magnitude of the RGC centroid from Bensby et al.
(2013 ) and Nataf et al. (2013 ), respectively. The instrumental
source color were measured by regressing the I- and V-band
photometry data with respect to the lensing magniﬁcation pr e-
dicted by the model. In the cases of KMT-2021-BLG-1968 and
KMT-2021-BLG-2010, for which the source stars are very fain t,
it was diﬃcult to securely measure the V-band magnitudes.
In this case, we utilized the Holtzman et al. (1998 ) CMD con-
structed from the observations of bulge stars using the Hubb le
Space Telescope (HST), and interpolate the source color fro m
the main-sequence branch on the HST CMD using the measured
I-band magnitude di ﬀerence between the source and RGC cen-
troid.
Figure 15shows the positions of the source stars and RGC
centroids in the CMDs of the individual events. In Table 7, we
list the values of ( V−I,I)S, (V−I,I)S,0, (V−I,I)RGC, and ( V−
I,I)RGC,0together with the stellar types determined from the de-
reddened color and magnitude. For the estimation of the angu lar
source radius from ( V−I,I)S,0, we ﬁrst converted the V−Icolor
into V−Kcolor, and then deduce θ∗from the Kervella et al.
(2004 ) relation between ( V−K,V) andθ∗. The estimated source
radii of the individual events are listed in Table 7.
With the measured source radius, we estimated the angular
Einstein radii using the relation in Equation ( 1). We also esti-
mated the relative lens-source proper motion from the combi na-
tion of the Einstein radius and event time scale by
µ=θE
tE. (3)
In Table 8, we list theθEandµvalues of the events for which the
planetary nature of the lenses are identiﬁed.

5. Physical parameters
In this section, we estimate the physical parameters of the t hree
identiﬁed planetary lens systems of KMT-2021-BLG-2010L,
KMT-2022-BLG-0371L, and KMT-2022-BLG-1013L. For none
of these events, the lensing observables ( tE,θE,πE) are not fully
measured, making it di ﬃcult to uniquely determine the mass M
and distance DLto the planetary systems via the analytic rela-
tions

Hereκ=4G/(c2AU),πS=AU/DSdenotes the parallax of

therefore, estimate the physical lens parameters by conduc ting
Bayesian analyses based on the measured observables of the i n-
dividual events.
The Bayesian analysis of each lensing event was carried by
conducting a Monte Carlo simulation of Galactic lensing eve nts.
From the simulation, we produced a large number (107) of lens-
ing events, for which the locations of the lens and source and the
relative proper motions were assigned based on a prior Galac -
tic model, and the lens masses were allocated based on a prior
mass function of Galactic objects. In the simulation, we ado pted
the Galactic model of Jung et al. (2021 ) and the mass function
model of Jung et al. (2018 ). For each simulated event, we com-
puted lensing observables by
tE=θE
µ;θE=(κMπrel)1/2;πE=πrel
θE, (5)
where the relative parallax is deﬁned as πrel=πL−πS=
AU(1/DL−1/DS). We then construct posterior distributions of
the physical parameters by imposing a weight wi=exp(−χ2/2)
to each simulated event. Here the χ2value is computed as
χ2
i=/parenleftBiggtE,i−tE
σtE/parenrightBigg2

, (6)
where ( tE,i,θE,i) represent the time scale and Einstein radius of
each simulated event, and ( tE,θE) denote the measured values.

host, a⊥=sDLθE. For each parameter, we present the median as
a representative value and the uncertainties are estimated as the
16% and 84% of the posterior distribution. For the events wit h
degenerate close and wide solutions, we present a pair of the pro-
jected separations resulting from the close and wide soluti ons.
According to the estimated planet and host masses, the plane -
tary system KMT-2021-BLG-2010L is composed of a Jovian-
mass planet and an M-dwarf host, the system KMT-2022-BLG-
0371L consists of a sub-Jovian-mass planet and a K-dwarf hos t,
and the system KMT-2022-BLG-1013L is composed of a sub-
Jovian-mass planet and an M-dwarf host.
6. Summary and conclusion
We conducted analyses of 4 anomalous microlensing events
detected in the 2021 and 2022 seasons, including KMT-2021-
BLG-1968, KMT-2021-BLG-2010, KMT-2022-BLG-0371, and
KMT-2022-BLG-1013. The light curves of the events commonly
exhibit partially covered short-term central anomalies ap pearing
near the highly magniﬁed peaks. In order to reveal the nature
of the anomalies, we tested various models that could give ri se
to the anomalies of the individual events including the bina ry-
lens and binary-source interpretations. Under the 2L1S int erpre-
tation, we thoroughly inspected the parameter space to chec k the
existence of degenerate solutions, and if they exist, we tes ted the
feasibility of resolving the degeneracy.
We found that the anomalies of the two events KMT-2021-
BLG-2010 and KMT-2022-BLG-1013 were uniquely explained
by planetary-lens interpretations, for which the planet-t o-host
mass ratios of q∼2.8×10−3and∼1.6×10−3, respectively.
For KMT-2022-BLG-0371, we found multiple sets of local 2L1S
solutions with diﬀerent combinations of binary parameters, but
a planetary solution with a mass ratio q∼4×10−4was strongly
preferred over the other degenerate solutions based on the χ2
and relative proper motion arguments, and a 1L2S solution wa sclearly ruled out. For KMT-2021-BLG-1968, on the other hand ,
it was found that the anomaly could be explained either by a
planetary or a binary-source interpretation, making it di ﬃcult to
ﬁrmly identify the nature of the anomaly.
From the Bayesian analyses of the identiﬁed planetary
events, we estimated that the masses of the planet and host we re
(Mp/MJ,Mh/M⊙)=(1.07+1.15
−0.68,0.37+0.40
−0.23), (0.26+0.13
−0.11,0.63+0.32
−0.28),
and (0.31+0.46
−0.16,0.18+0.28
−0.10) for KMT-2021-BLG-2010L, KMT-
2022-BLG-0371L, and KMT-2022-BLG-1013L, respectively.
