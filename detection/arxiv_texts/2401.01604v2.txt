ABSTRACT
An important aspect of solar energetic particle (SEP) events is the ir source populations. Elemen-
tal abundance enhancements of impulsive SEP events, originating in presumed coronal reconnection
episodes, can be ﬁtted to steep power laws of A/Q, where A and Q ar e the atomic mass and ionic
charge. Since thermal electron energies are enhanced and nonth ermal electron distributions arise in
the reconnection process, we might expect that ionic charge stat es Q would be increased through ion-
ization interactions with those electron populations during the acce leration process. The temperature
estimated from the SEPs corresponds to the charge state during the acceleration process, while the
actual charge state measured in situ may be modiﬁed as the SEPs pa ss through the corona.
WeexaminewhetherthetemperatureestimationfromtheA/Qwould diﬀerwithvariouskappavalues
in a kappa function representing high-energy tail deviating from a M axwellian velocity distribution.
We ﬁnd that the diﬀerences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian and an ext reme kappa distribution are
only about 10-30%. We ﬁt power-law enhancement of element abund ances as a function of their A/Q
with variouskappa values. Then, we ﬁnd that the derivedsourcere giontemperatureis not signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by whether or not the electron velocity distribution deviat es from a Maxwellian, i.e., thermal,
distribution. Assuming that electrons are heated in the acceleratio n region, the agreement of the
SEP charge state during acceleration with typical active region tem peratures suggests that SEPs are
accelerated and leave the acceleration region in a shorter time than the ionization time scale.

1.INTRODUCTION
Solar energetic (E ≥3 MeV/nuc) particle (SEP) events are observed in two broad categ ories, gradual and impul-
sive (Reames 2020 ,2021). While the gradual events result from diﬀusive shock acceleration (DSA) in coronal and
interplanetary shocks usually driven by wide and fast (V >1000 km s−1) coronal mass ejections (CMEs), the impulsive
events originate in coronal jets on open magnetic ﬁeld lines driven by magnetic reconnection and are characterized by
relatively low intensities and energies (E = <20 MeV/nuc). CME shocks can accelerate particles by the DSA proc ess,
and the turbulence and electric ﬁelds in the magnetic reconnection r egions of solar jets/ﬂares can also produce power-
law distributions of energetic particles. SEP events classiﬁed as gra dual are attributed to CME shock acceleration,
while those classiﬁed as impulsive are associated with ﬂare acceleratio n,3He enhancement and type III radio bursts
(Reames 1999 ). Typically, the rise time and duration of gradual events are longer than those of impulsive ones, and
protons dominate gradual events while electrons can dominate impu lsive ones The source regions of gradual events are
widely distributed in solar longitude, while most impulsive ones originate in a narrower range of longitude between

30◦W and 80◦W, and gradual SEPs tend to show elemental abundances near nor mal coronal values, while impulsive
SEPs show strong enhancements of Fe and other heavy elements ( Reames 1999 ).
To further understand the nature of SEPs, it is important to ident ify their source regions: Are they produced
in ordinary coronal plasma, in active regions, in coronal plasma enric hed in seed particles by earlier events, or in
prominence material ejected during CMEs? One diagnostic for the o rigin of SEP particles is the elemental composition
ofthe plasma. AseconddiagnosticisthechargestatesoftheSEPs . Thesearelinked, becausetheaccelerationeﬃciency
is expected to depend on the particle’s gyroradius, and therefore to scale as ( A/Q)α(Caprioli et al. 2017 ), where A
is the particle mass, Q is the charge, and αis the power law index, though the enhancement may saturate at lar ge A
(Hanusch et al. 2019 ).
The earliestmeasurements ofionization states ( Luhn et al. 1984 ,1987) havefound that gradualevents had measured
states corresponding to ∼2 MK, but impulsive events had QFe≈20 and Ne, Mg, and Si were fully ionized. The
high ionization states in impulsive events could be produced in the acce leration region, or they could be produced
by subsequent stripping. In the latter case, it was not clear why Ne , Mg, and Si would be enhanced, since they had
A/Q=2. Finally, Q was found to vary with velocity, so the stripping inte rpretation prevailed (e.g. DiFabio et al. 2008 ).
Reames and collaborators have explored these diagnostics in a serie s of papers ( Reames et al. 1999 ;Reames 2000 ;
Reames & Tylka 2002 ;Reames 2014 ;Reames et al. 2014a ;Reames 2016 ,2017,2018,2020,2022a). In some events, the
average charge state <Q>of Fe increases with energy, indicating stripping of the Fe ions during acceleration in high
density regions ( Barghouty & Mewaldt 1999 ;Kovaltsov et al. 2001 ;DiFabio et al. 2008 ), but in most events the charge
stateisindependent ofenergy,atleastatmoderateenergies. In theeventsthat donotshowevidenceofstrippingduring
acceleration, it is possible to determine <Q>in the source region by ﬁtting ( A/Q)αto the elemental abundances
(Ellison & Eichler 1984 ;Caprioli et al. 2017 ;Hanusch et al. 2019 ). The resulting <Q>generally indicates T = 1 to
3 MK in the source regions of both impulsive and gradual events ( Reames 2022a ), indicating normal coronal or active
region plasma. That result is somewhat surprising, in that one might e xpect strong heating and large populations
of energetic electrons in reconnection current sheets, leading to elevated values of <Q>in impulsive events. High
chargestates in current sheets are observed in EUV images and UV spectra ( Reeves & Golub 2011 ;Warren et al. 2018 ;
Innes et al. 2003 ;Ciaravella & Raymond 2008 ) and predicted by models ( Shen et al. 2013 ,2023). The heating may be
lessintensein jets thanin ﬂares; Joshi et al. (2020) found temperaturesof1.4-1.8MK.However, Paraschiv et al. (2015)
found that 75% of the 16 jets they analyzed were between 1 MK and 3 MK, and 25% were 4 MK and above. Evidence
for nonthermal electrons comes from type III radio bursts as we ll as X-rays ( Paraschiv et al. 2022 ;Battaglia et al.
2023;Zhang et al. 2023 ).Paterson et al. (2023) found that NuSTAR observations of a jet were compatible with som e
nonthermal emission, but that the spectrum would have to be stee p.
Here we examine the eﬀects ofnon-Maxwellian electron distributions , on the initial temperatures derived from ﬁtting
(A/Q)αto measured abundance distributions. In Section 2, we describe th e calculations and results of the A/Q with
the non-Maxwellianelectron distributions and the temperature fro m the power-lawﬁtting ( A/Q)αto a mean elemental
abundance enhancement of impulsive SEP events. In Section 3, we d iscuss our results. In Section 4, we summarize
our work and present conclusions.
2.ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
We consider a plasma whose electron velocity distribution is out of the rmal equilibrium as a result of particle
energization in the solar corona in a magnetic reconnecting current sheet. Acceleration processes may well yield
electron and ion distributions that diﬀer signiﬁcantly from each othe r, but we seek an electron velocity distribution
through which we can describe the ion charge states and their varia tions inA/Q. Classical particle systems reside
at thermal equilibrium with their velocity distribution function stabilize d into a Maxwellian distribution. However,
collisionless and correlated particle systems, such as the space and astrophysical plasmas, are characterized by a non-
Maxwellian behavior, often described by the so-called kappa distribu tion, a more generalized form of particle velocity
distribution where temperature and kappa are two independent pa rameters ( Livadiotis & McComas 2013 ). Kappa
distributions resemble a thermal core with a power-law tail. They are general, physically meaningful, distribution
functions that describe particle systems out of thermal equilibrium . Use of empirical kappa distributions has become
increasingly widespread across space and plasma physics, describin g particles in the heliosphere, from the solar wind
and planetary magnetospheres to the heliosheath ( Livadiotis 2018 ). We will use kappa functions here to model non-
Maxwellian plasmas in the impulsive SEP acceleration region, which is likely t o be a reconnecting current sheet.Charge states and abundances in SEPs 3
2.1.Mass to charge ratio with various kappa values
ThesourceregiontemperaturesforimpulsiveSEPeventshavebee ncalculatedusingthedependenceoftheabundance
enhancements in SEPs on the mass-to-charge ratios ( A/Q) (Reames et al. 2014a ;Reames 2016 ,2018). Elements with
low ﬁrst ionization potential (FIP <10 eV) are enhanced in the corona by about a few factors with resp ect to the
photosphere (e.g. Feldman 1992 ;Schmelz et al. 2012 ). The abundance enhancements observed in SEPs show the “FIP
eﬀect” (Schmelz et al. 2012 ;Reames 2018 ), but the patterns of the enhancements diﬀer in impulsive and grad ual SEPs
(e.g.Reames 2020 ). The heavy elements are more enhanced in the impulsive SEPs, while t he gradualevents are similar
to the corresponding element abundances in the solar corona ( Reames et al. 2014a ).
The temperatures of the impulsive SEPs’ sourceregionare found t o be about 2 ∼3 MK by ﬁtting the SEPabundance
power-lawdistributionvs( A/Q)α, whichdependsonthe electrontemperature(e.g. Reames2020 ). Theseareconsistent
with recent studies based on EUV observationsof the active region that produced an impulsive SEP event ( Buˇ c´ ık et al.
2021), though the active region is far larger than the SEP source region . However, these works assume a Maxwellian
electron distribution in calculating the average charge state, <Q>, while the electrons are likely to be out of thermal
equilibrium during the energization.
We examine how much the temperature estimation from the A/Q would diﬀer with various kappa values in a kappa
function representing high-energy tails deviating from a Maxwellian v elocity distribution. We use the KAPPA package
(Dzifˇ c´ akov´ a et al. 2021 ) recently upgraded with the CHIANTI 10 atomic database ( Del Zanna et al. 2021 ) with the κ
distributions deﬁned as in Dzifˇ c´ akov´ a et al. (2021),

whereq(i,T) is the ion fraction of charge state iof eachZandκas a function of the temperature, obtained from
the KAPPA package. The ion fractions depend on the density and te mperature in time-dependent nonequilibrium
ionization. In this calculation, we assume ionization equilibrium since the particle acceleration timescales can be much
shorter than the ionization/recombination timescales.
Figure1shows the electron kinetic energy distributions at 3 MK with various κvalues calculated using the KAPPA
package. When the κvalue goes to inﬁnity, the distributions are the same as the Maxwellian distribution (see
equation 1), and the lower κvalue means the higher deviation from the Maxwellian distribution. At a n extreme case
ofκ=2, the energy distribution is higher at lower energy (a few to sever al tens of eV) and represents the high-energy
tails at the higher than a few thousand eV.
Figure2(a) shows the A/Q(whereQis the average charge state as in Eq.(2)) calculated using the KAPPA
package with kappa distributions of κ=2, 5, 33, and Maxwellian distribution. The diﬀerences in A/Qto that from
the Maxwellian distribution are generally larger with smaller κvalues. We show A/Qcalculated for the elements, C,
O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe with more κvalues in Figure 3. The diﬀerences from diﬀerent κvalues are relatively larger at
lower temperatures and show the general eﬀect of enhanced ioniz ation (thus lower A/Q) with lower kappa values such
as C, O, and Ne in upper panels in Figure 3. This is illustrated in Figure 4(a) for O ions. At lower temperatures,
the peak of the kappa distribution shifts toward lower energy, thu s the number of electrons above, e.g., the ionization
potential of O+6(740 eV) increases for lower κbecause the power-law tail begins to dominate. This leads to the eﬀe ct
of< QO>increasing (A/Q decreasing) with decreasing κfor temperatures below about 2 MK (Figure 3). In the case
ofκ=2 for the higher Z elements, however, this trend is reversed at te mperatures around a few MK, especially in Fe
(lower panels in Figure 3). This occurs both because there are fewer electrons at 250-35 0 eV energies that can ionize
the Si and Fe ions typically found at coronal temperatures, and be cause there are more electrons at energies of a few
tens of eV that can drive dielectronic recombination (Figure 4(b)).
Figure5shows several ion fractions of O and Fe, as a function of temperat ure, representing low and high Z elements,
respectively. In the case of O, the ion fractions with the lower κare greater at lower temperatures (Figure 5(a)). In4 Lee et al.
other words, the peaks of the ion fractions with lower κare left shifted to the lower temperatures. It indicates that
the charge states are higher at the coronal temperature, so A/ Q decreases. On the other hand, in the case of Fe, the
ion fractions with κ= 2 shift toward higher temperatures (Figure 5(b)), leading to lower charge states at the coronal
temperature with lower κ, so A/Q increases. However, we ﬁnd that the diﬀerences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian
and an extreme kappa distribution are only about 10-30%.
Earlier publications used diﬀerent atomic data compilations (e.g. Reames et al. 2014b , usedMazzotta & Rothenﬂug
(1985) for elements below Fe, and Arnaud & Raymond (1992) for Fe). To investigate the impact from atomic data,
we also compare A/Q in ionization equilibrium with the Maxwellian distributio n from CHIANTI V10, Mazzotta et al.
(1998),Mazzotta & Rothenﬂug (1985),Arnaud & Raymond (1992) in Figure 2(b). We ﬁnd that the diﬀerences in
theA/Qamong them are small (at most 30% in high-Z elements of Ca and Fe). I n addition, we ﬁnd that the A/Q
approaches the value of “two” at higher temperatures for all elem ents (except Fe) since these elements are almost
fully ionized at higher temperatures of about 10 MK. Therefore, th eA/Qwould not be an appropriate parameter to
estimate the high temperature plasma at the source region.
2.2.Power law ﬁtting of mass to charge ratio vs. abundance enhanc ements
A comprehensive study of 111 impulsive events observed with the Lo w Energy Matrix Telescope (LEMT) on the
Wind spacecraft was carried out by Reames et al. (2014b,a);Reames et al. (2015), selected with the requirement of
(Fe/O)/0.131 >4 where 0.131 is the assumed coronal value of Fe/O. CMEs of median w idths (75 °) and speeds (600 km
s−1) were associated with 69% (66 of 96) of the events with available LAS CO coronagraph observations ( Reames et al.
2014b).
Assuming A/Qvalues characteristic of a coronal plasma temperature range of 2 .5-3 MK, Reames et al. (2014b)
plotted the mean elemental enhancements from He to Pb versus th eir A/Q for 111 impulsive events. They found
the power-law least-squares best ﬁt slope of 3.64 ±0.15 (see Figure 8 in their paper). In their subsequent work,
Reames et al. (2014a) introduced a least squares best ﬁt methodology to determine bot h the most probable power of
abundance enhancement versus A/Qand the best value of source plasma temperature T to determine Q. They applied
the technique to each of the 111 impulsive SEP events, then compar ed the results to properties of associated CMEs,
ﬂares, and3He-rich events.
TheA/Qof most elements tends to follow the order of atomic number Z (Figur e2). But, around 2 ∼3 MK, the A/Q
is opposite as ( A/Q)Ne>(A/Q)Mg>(A/Q)Siin Figure 6. The observed enhancements in impulsive SEP events also
follow the order Ne >Mg>Si (Figure 7). It has been discussed that this feature accounts for the best ﬁt at 2−3 MK
in the power-law ﬁt of the abundance enhancements of the impulsive SEP events( Reames et al. 2014b ;Reames 2018 ,
2021). These features are applicable in Maxwellian plasma and larger values ofκ. In the extreme case of κ=2,A/Q
follows the order of Z, ( A/Q)Si>(A/Q)Mg>(A/Q)Ne(Figure6(a)). The A/Qof Maxwellian plasma in ionization
equilibria from various atomic rate compilations keep the opposite ord er (Figure 6(b)). Thus, we examine these eﬀects
on the power-law ﬁt for estimating the source region temperature .
We adopt the mean abundance enhancement in impulsive SEP events e xplained above in Reames et al. (2014b) (see
Table 1 and Figure 8 in their paper). The abundance enhancement is e xpressed as the ratio of the observed mean
element abundances (X) divided by Oxygen (O) (( X/O)ISEP) over the enhancements relative to a coronal abundance
based on the Feldman (1992) coronal abundance set (Sun Coronal 1992feldman ext.abund in CHIANTI) (( X/O)cor).
Note that Reames et al. (2014b) use the enhancements relative to mean element abundances of gr adual SEP events
(Table 1 in their paper). It has been known that the abundances in g radual events are closely related to the coronal
abundances ( Reames et al. 2014a ). We present the abundances in Table 1. Figure 7shows that the mean abundance
enhancements of the elements mostly follow the order of Z, except the opposite order of Ne >Mg>Si.
Figure8shows the abundance enhancement with A/Qat 1, 3.2, and 5.6 MK. As discussed in Section 2.1, the
diﬀerences of A/Qwith various κvalues at higher temperatures are modest, so the abundance enh ancements with κ
values are most spread out at lower temperatures around 1 MK.
The strong power-law dependence of the abundance enhancemen ts on A/Q in impulsive SEP events has been
explained by the high A/Qparticles gaining energy more easily than protons and enhancing the ir abundances
(Drake et al. 2009 ). The power-law ﬁts yield estimated source region temperatures o f impulsive SEP events to be
∼2-5 MK using the charge states calculated assuming Maxwellian distrib ution (Reames et al. 2014a ,b). We test the
power-law enhancement of element abundances as a function A/Qwith various κvalues by using a relation between
the abundance enhancement (AB) and A/Q,Charge states and abundances in SEPs 5

Applying a decimal logarithm, we ﬁt a ﬁrst order linear equation,
Log10(AB) =αLog10(A

whereαis a slope representing the power-law index and b is a Y-intercept. Th en, we ﬁnd a minimum reduced

Reames et al. (2014b) and assuming 25% uncertainty in the coronal abundance, and n is t he number of elements.
We use 10 elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe), not includ ing He and the higher Z elements (Z=34 −82)
fromReames et al. (2014b). In previous studies, Reames(2017) found that the He/O ratio varies widely from event
to event, and it causes a second minima at high temperatures in the ﬁ ts of gradual events. Later, Reames(2022b)
ﬁnds that the shock-driven SEP events show more He (see Figure 1 3 in the paper). In addition, sounding rocket
observations reveal that helium is depleted in the equatorial region s during the quiet Sun ( Moses et al. 2020 ). For the
reason of this, we exclude He for the power-law ﬁtting. We show the ﬁtting parameters at the second minimum in
Table2.
We ﬁnd three χ2
rminima in the temperature range of 105∼108K (Figure 9(a)). Both the χ2
rminima at coronaland
transition region temperatures are statistically acceptable, but t he higher temperature is not. The power-law ﬁts at
the second minimum are shown in Figure 9(b). This is a ﬁt for a single temperature, and the situation where th e SEPs
are produced may be more complicated. A power law ﬁt using a set of im pulsive SEP abundances in Reames et al.
(2014b) shows that the temperatures are 2.5 −3.2 MK. These are similar to 2.51 MK at the second minimum of χ2
r
with various κvalues and 3.55 MK for κ=2 (Table 2). Theαis in the range of 3.52 −3.62 with various κvalues and
3.52±0.36 with Maxwellian (Table 2), and it is close to the the value, 3.64 ±0.15, inReames et al. (2014b).
At the ﬁrst minimum at about 0.1 −0.2 MK, the αis smaller at about 1.7 −2.0. Cooler material, such as a ﬁlament
near a jet eruption, could be a possible explanation for this lower tem perature minimum as reported by Mason et al.
(2016). However, their work is for a rare type of3He-rich SEP events with enormously enhanced values of the S/O
ratio, and we use the mean enhancement of 111 impulsive events. Th erefore, this low temperature minimum would be
worth investigating with individual events as a separate work in the f uture.
2.3.Distributions of power-law index and temperature
Reames et al. (2015) compiled distributions ofT and the powerindex of A/Q, reﬁning their workby adding 11cooler
He-poor (He/O/47 <0.4) and 4 hotter (Ne/C/0.374 ≤Si/C/0.360) impulsive SEP events to the original 111 impulsive
SEP events. Nearly all best ﬁt plasma temperatures T lay in the rang e 2.0-4.0 MK, but the mean of the distribution
of power-law index of A/Qwas 4.47±0.07, steeper than what might be expected from Figure 8 in their pap er. Only 9
of their 126 power-law indices of A/Qlay outside the range of 2.0-7.0.
We examine the distribution of the power-law index αand temperatures with the κ=2, 5, 33, and Maxwellian in
Figure10. Theαis at around 4, and the temperature is 2 −3 MK for the lower χ2
r(close to black color). In the
extreme case of κ=2,αis slightly higher, and the temperature is slightly higher (3 −4 MK). Overall, we conﬁrm that
the temperatures and the power-lawindex values are within the ran ge in previous works. Therefore, the derived source
region temperature is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by whether or not t he electron velocity distribution deviates from a
Maxwellian, i.e., thermal distribution.
3.DISCUSSION
Impulsive SEP events are associated with small ﬂares or coronal je ts and type III radio bursts ( Reames 2020 ),
indicating magnetic reconnection allowing accelerated particles to es cape along open magnetic ﬁelds to the heliosphere
(Buˇ c´ ık et al. 2018a ,b;Buˇ c´ ık 2022 ). The initial acceleration process is assumed to occur in magnetic re connecting
current sheets, likely between a loop footpoint of one magnetic pola rity and adjacent open ﬁelds of opposite polarity6 Lee et al.
(Reames2021 ). Extensivemodelingofelectronaccelerationduringthereconnec tionprocesscontinueswith increasingly
sophisticatedmodels. Magnetic islandsform in the currentsheet an d growlarger,reﬂecting electronsfromtheir ends in
a classic Fermi acceleration process ( Drake et al. 2006 ). Ion acceleration begins with their entry into the reconnection
exhausts governed by a threshold requirement favoring high A/Qions for perpendicular heating ( Drake & Swisdak
2012). The main ion acceleration takes place due to Fermi reﬂection in con tracting and merging magnetic islands.
The bulk of the converted magnetic energy goes into forming a nont hermal electron power-law distribution, but the
electron energy gain can be suppressed by a strong guide ﬁeld ( Arnold et al. 2021 ), which may initially be large, but
then weaken as the ﬂare progresses ( Dahlin et al. 2022 ).
Current modeling eﬀorts assume constant ionic A/Qvalues during the acceleration process (e.g. Kramoliˇ s et al.
2022), so it is reasonable to suppose, as Reames does, that the best ﬁt temperatures derived from the SEP event
abundance versus A/Qplots reﬂect those of the SEP seed populations. However, the elec tron acceleration proceeds
with shorter time scales ( ≃10−3s) than those of the ions ( ≃1 s) (Li et al. 2022 ), and that suggests that for suﬃciently
high plasma densities the nonthermal electron population may intera ct with the ions to enhance their charge states
through ionization collisions. This could leave the ions with diminished A/Qratios through signiﬁcant portions of the
acceleration process.
We have found that if the energy goes mainly into producing a κdistribution with a high energy tail, the value of
A/Qis not strongly aﬀected. However, if the electrons are strongly he ated,A/Qcan be decreased. Both observations
and models of the current sheets in solar ﬂares show that Fe will be io nized from charge states near +13 at active
region temperatures to charge states of at least +23 ( Shen et al. 2013 ;Warren et al. 2018 ). Since oxygen is already at
a charge state of +6 to +7 in the active region, and it can only attain a charge state of +8 when fully stripped, its
A/Qcan be only modestly reduced. Therefore, one would expect a signiﬁ cant change in the Fe/O ratio. It is possible
that in the smaller jet events that produce impulsive SEPs, the SEPs leave the region of strong electron energization
on a timescale shorter than the ionization time, which is around 109/nes. It is also possible that electrons and ions
are accelerated in diﬀerent places. However, our results suggest a third possibility – that the electrons are accelerated
into nonthermal distributions that do not drastically change A/Q. In particular, we note that the κdistribution does
not signiﬁcantly improve χ2over Maxwellian ﬁts, so the observations do not require non-therm al distributions.
It is also important to note that elemental abundances may be the b est way to determine the ionization state, and
hence the temperature, in the region where SEPs are acclerated, because the ionization states measured in situ may
have been altered by stripping as the SEPs propagate through the corona.
4.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
A series of papers by Reames et al. has used the measured ionization states of SEPs and the assumption that the
elemental abundances are enhanced in proportion to ( A/Q)αto determine the ionization equilibrium temperatures of
the sourceregions. The temperaturesthey found weretypicala ctiveregiontemperatures, whichis somewhatsurprising
in that electrons are also accelerated in the jets that produce impu lsive SEPs, and solar ﬂare plasma sheets show much
higher charge states than the surrounding active regions.
We ﬁnd that κdistributions produce similar values of A/Qto Maxwellian distributions with the same temperature,
because at a given temperature the κdistribution, as deﬁned in Eq.(1), shifts electrons to both higher an d lower
energies (Figure 1). Therefore, one explanation for the observa tion that the source region temperatures derived for
impulsive SEP events are typical active region temperatures is that electron energization produces a κdistribution
without greatly changing the temperature. However, other expla nations are also possible, including that electrons
and ions are accelerated in diﬀerent regions or that the SEPs leave t he acceleration region in a time shorter than the
ionization timescale.

Figure 4. κ-distributions with various κvalues at 3 MK overplotted with ionization potentials of O an d Fe ions. The energy
distributions with various κvalues are the same as in Figure 1. We added vertical lines of the ionization potentials and co ronal
temperatures in eV. Black dotted vertical lines represent t he ionization potentials of each ion from 0+ (lowest energy) to +Z-1
(highest energy). The red (3 MK) and green (2 and 5 MK) dashed l ines represent the usual coronal temperatures in active
regions that roughly point to the dominant coronal ionizati on stages around these temperatures.Charge states and abundances in SEPs 11
