Trapped atoms on photonic structures inspire many novel quantum devices for quantum information pro-
cessing and quantum sensing. Here, we have demonstrated a hybrid photonic-atom chip platform based on
a GaN-on-sapphire chip and the transport of an ensemble of atoms from free space towards the chip with an
optical conveyor belt. The maximum transport efﬁciency of atoms is about 50% with a transport distance of
500mm. Our results open up a new route toward the efﬁciently loading of cold atoms into the evanescent-ﬁeld
trap formed by the photonic integrated circuits, which promises strong and controllable interactions between
single atoms and single photons.
I. INTRODUCTION
By introducing neutral atoms to integrated photonic de-
vices, the hybrid photonic-atomic chip (PAC) has attracted
extensive research in recent years [1–5]. Beneﬁting from the
strongly enhanced light-matter interactions due to the tightly
optical ﬁeld conﬁnement at the wavelength and even subwave-
length scale, PAC holds great potential in many quantum-
based applications, such as quantum memory [6, 7], novel
quantum light sources [8], chiral quantum optics devices [9,
10], nodes of quantum networks [11–13], novel quantum op-
tics phenomena with surface plasmons [14, 15], many-body
physics [16, 17], and quantum sensing [18, 19].
Early efforts on trapping cold neutral atoms near surface
microstructures was ﬁrstly explored above current carrying
microstructures [20, 21], which can be tailored to create a
variety of potential geometry and guiding schemes for cold
atoms. Atoms are manipulated by the magnetic ﬁled and the
distances between the atoms and microstructures surface can
be reduced to as close as 0 :5mm [20]. With the advance-
ment of fabrication techniques in photonic structures, manipu-
lation of single atoms at wavelength and even subwavelength
scale is possible with the tightly conﬁned optical ﬁeld con-
ﬁnement near the photonic structures. Many groundbreaking
experimental results in coupling atoms to photonic structures
have been achieved in various nanophotonic platforms [7, 22–
32]. However, these researches move forward with some po-
tential disadvantages. For instance, the platforms based on
nanoﬁbers [7, 30–32] are suspended in vacuum, thus are po-
tentially unstable and have poor thermal conductivity, which
imposes limitations on the atom trap lifetime and atom coher-
ence time [33, 34]. Besides, vacuum feedthrough for the cou-
pling of light in and out of the nanoﬁber brings complexity in
ﬁber alignment and assembly. Other platforms based on solid-
state microcavities, such as microtoroid or bottle microres-
onators [9, 28, 29, 35], unable to directly load laser cooled
atoms into the evanescent-ﬁeld trap [36], face difﬁculties in
deterministic loading and trapping of cold atoms. Althoughthe reported single atom-photon interaction time has been im-
proved from only a few microseconds [28] to 2ms [29], the
further extension of the system to more photonic structures
and more atoms is very challenging.
In order to achieve deterministic atom trapping on inte-
grated photonic devices, important theoretical and experimen-
tal milestones have been reached with unsuspended waveg-
uide and microring structures [22–27, 37, 38]. Atoms are
loaded into the evanescent ﬁeld of the photonic structures
from free space with optical tweezers and optical conveyor
belts. These methods exhibit a highly precise control of
atomic motion near photonic structures, including photonic
crystal waveguides [22–25] and microring resonators [26, 27,
37]. Additionally, these demonstrations are compatible with
on-chip integrated devices for cooling, transport, and trapping
of cold atoms [39–41].
In this work, we report on transporting free space cooled
87Rb atoms towards a GaN-on-sapphire chip [38] with an op-
tical conveyor belt [22, 42–44]. The conveyor belt consists
of two focused beams, both beams passing through the sap-
phire substrate perpendicularly. After careful spatial calibra-
tion of the beams and phase stabilization, our conveyor belt di-
rectly transports 104trapped atoms with a temperature around
40mK toward the chip, without extra aberration of the focus
beam from the sapphire substrate. The maximum transport
efﬁciency of atoms is about 50% with a transport distance
of 500 mm. It paves the way for the further implementation
of stable atom trapping on the GaN-on-sapphire chip, pro-
motes the realization of deterministic loading of atoms into
the evanescent-ﬁeld trap, which are promising for realizing
the on-chip single-photon-level optical nonlinearity.
II. OVERVIEW OF THE PHOTONIC-ATOM CHIP
Figure 1 illustrates our experimental setup for studying the
PAC, where a GaN-on-sapphire chip is placed inside the vac-
uum cell (25mm25mm50mm). Figure 1(a) shows a pho-arXiv:2305.07900v1  [physics.atom-ph]  13 May 20232
FIG. 1. Schematic of our experimental system, with a GaN-on-Sapphire chip (5mm 10mm) platform placed inside the vacuum cell. Two
pairs of cooling laser beams with crossing angle of 60 degree in X-Y plane go parallel to the chip surface, while the third pair passes through
the crossing of the beams in X-Y plane and the chip surface at an angle of 60 degree to the chip surface. 781nm dipole laser beams are
splitted by a polarizing beam splitter (PBS), pass through the acousto-optic modulator (AOM) and focus onto the chip by a pair of lens with
focus length f =100mm. (a) Photograph of our PAC plaform in vacuum cell. (b) Picture of micro-fabricated microring resonator and the bus

tograph of our PAC platform in a vacuum cell. We use low
vapor pressure epoxy (Torr Seal) to stick the chip onto a metal
holder while maintaining high vacuum and enduring the high
temperature during the vacuum baking process. Half of the
chip without fabrication is glued onto a 316-L stainless steel
holder, and the remaining part of the chip is suspended in vac-
uum with waveguide and microring resonator structures fab-
ricated on the surface. The metal holder is then connected to
a CF35 vacuum cube, providing heat dissipation and stability
for the chip.
Figure 1(b) shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM)
image of a fabricated microring resonator and the bus waveg-
uides on top of the GaN-on-sapphire chip. The size of the
sapphire substrate is 5mm 10mm. The microring resonator
is vacuum-cladded for direct interaction between atoms and
the evanescent ﬁeld of the conﬁned modes, with a major ra-
dius of 60 mm and a cross-section of 700nm 420nm, and the
optical modes of the microring are coupled to a bus waveg-
uide through the evanescent ﬁeld. Such microring resonators
have been widely studied in photonics applications, due to
their easy fabrication, high quality factor and small mode vol-
ume [45]. Here, we adapt the GaN-on-sapphire platform for
PAC following our previous theoretical proposal [38], as the
system is more stable without suspended photonic structures.In addition, both GaN and sapphire are wide-band-gap mate-
rials that are transparent to ultrabroadband wavelengths (260
- 1590 nm) [46, 47], thus our chip is compatible with lasers
working in the visible and near-visible wavelengths for many
alkali and alkaline-earth atoms, allowing full optical access
for cold rubidium atom cooling, trapping, transport and de-
tection. The realization of the on-chip single-photon-level
optical nonlinearity highly depends on the cooperativity pa-
rameter C=3l2
4p2Q
Vm, where l=780nm is the wavelength of
the D2 line of rubidium atoms. The cooperativity parame-
ter is proportional to the ratio of the quality factor Qand the
mode volume Vmfor the microring resonator . For our micror-
ing resonator parameter, the currently achieved quality factor
Q=3:75104, mainly limited by the surface roughness.
As shown in Fig. 1, our optical conﬁgurations of the exper-
iments could be divided into three parts: (i) coupling to PAC,
(ii) magneto-optical trap (MOT) , and (iii) optical conveyor
belt. First, at both ends the GaN-on-sapphire chip, light is
coupled in and out of the photonic chip through a high numer-
ical aperture (N.A.) objectives. Figure 1(c) shows the photo-
graph of our testing setup for the coupling to PAC. A coupling
efﬁciency of about 20% for the GaN waveguide in Fig. 1(b)
for optical signals with 780nm wavelength can be achieved
with commercial N:A:=0:4 objectives.3
The cold87Rb atoms are then prepared through a stan-
dard six-beam magneto-optical trap [48]. The glass cell is
connected to a mini cube and a 30L =s ion pump, resulting
in a pressure of 10 9mbar measured by the ion-pump cur-
rent. Three pairs of cooling laser beams are generated from
a 780nm laser, with the power of each beam being about
150mW and the beam waist being 1mm. The cooling laser
beam is red detuned by 8MHz from the jF=2i!jF0=3i
D2 cycling transition. Additionally, 80 mW of repump laser
beams overlap with one of the cooling laser beams. The
beams intersect at one point about 1mm above the surface
of the chip, with additional anti-Helmholtz coils aligned with
the point providing a magnetic ﬁeld gradient up to 10G =cm.
To align with our PAC, two pairs of cooling laser beams with
a crossing angle of 60 degree in the X-Y plane go parallel
to the chip surface, while the third pair passes through the
crossing of the beams in the X-Y plane and the chip surface
at an angle of 60 degree to the chip surface. Although MOT
beam pairs are not oriented orthogonal to each other, 3D atom
conﬁnement is still achieved as components of each beam are
projected along the orthogonal axis.
Following the 3D MOT procedure, the temperature of
the atom ensemble around 40 mK is ﬁnally achieved by a
polarization-gradient cooling (PGC) process. With a dura-
tion of 2ms for the PGC, the cooling laser beams detun-
ing is ramped down to  48MHz from the cycling transi-
tion. Figure 2(a) shows a density contour plot of the atom
ensemble, which is deduced from a single shot free space ab-
sorption image[49]. The cold atoms are about 800 mm away
from the chip surface, and the atom number density is about
31010cm 3with an atom cloud radius about 190 mm. The
distance between the atom cloud and the chip surface can be
adjusted from 300 mm to 1000 mm by adjusting the offset coil
and the alignment of the cooling beams. However, in close
proximity to the chip, the density and shape of the atomic
cloud is altered due to surface reﬂections, which is consistent
with previous observations[50].
III. TRANSPORTING ATOMS TOWARDS THE CHIP
The optical conveyor belt is realized by an optical dipole
trap, which consists of two linearly polarized counter-
propagating Gaussian beams with beam waist w0=20mm,
and the waist is located in the middle of the MOT atom cloud
and the chip surface. The intensities of both beams are equal,
and their optical frequencies are different by detuning Dn.
The two counterpropagating dipole laser beams come from
a single laser, with l=781nm corresponding to a frequency
2:3THz red detuned to the87Rb atom D2 transition. The laser
is split into two paths and then passed through a double-pass
80 MHz acousto-optic modulator (AOM), with Dncontrol-
lable via the RF signals applied to the AOMs. Therefore, the
two beams generate a spatially and temporally varying trap
potential U(z;t) =U0cos2(2pDn
2t 2p
lz), where U0is the local
trap depth and zis the position of atoms along the beam axis.Trapped atoms are conﬁned in the lattice antinodes and moved
with the temporally varying trap potential (see Fig. 1(d)).
In order to transport atoms towards the surface of the PAC,
we ﬁrst load approximately 104atoms into a standing-wave
dipole trap with Dn=0 by overlapping both dipole beams
with the 3D MOT for 150ms. Here, each beam has a power
of 9mW, which corresponds to a trap depth of about 1 :3mK.
After the loading process, atoms are trapped in a series of lat-
tice antinodes along the beam axis, with an axial distribution
of about 150 mm limited by the size of the atom cloud. Then, a
frequency chirping sequence of Dn(see the inset of Fig. 3(a)),
which is achieved by the sweep mode of the signal generator,
is sent to one of the AOMs to create a moving optical conveyor
belt, and the antinodes move at a velocity [42]

To verify the transport of atoms towards the chip surface, we
take an absorption image of cold atoms in the optical con-
veyor belt after the transport process. Figure 2(b) shows the
results indicating the ensemble of atoms near the chip sur-
face (the dashed red line). Compared with the image of the
atom cloud prepared by MOT, our conveyor belt has success-
fully delivered atoms towards the chip. Then, the transport
of atoms in the optical conveyor belt is systematically investi-
gated. Through a sequence of Dn, as illustrated by the inset of
Fig. 3(a), we could transport the atoms over a certain distance
by ramping up Dnintramp =1ms to Dnmax, holding the de-
tuning for a duration of t, and then ramping down Dnin 1ms.

d=500mm. We observe a clear peak at t=13ms, indicating a peak
atom ﬂux accumulating on the chip surface. The error bar comes
from three continuous measurement sequences. Solid curve is the ﬁt

where J(t)describes the atomic ﬂux to the chip surface by
the optical conveyor belt and Gis the linear atomic loss co-
efﬁcient. Here, Gis mainly attributed to the atom collision
and absorption loss on the chip surface, heating by the op-
tical dipole trap, and the vacuum gas collisions. Since the
atomic density is relatively low, the nonlinear atomic loss due
to atomic collisions is neglected. According to the atomic
cloud shape, we made the assumption that atomic ﬂux is a

where J0is the maximum atomic ﬂux density, t0is the time

block of the chip, and s0describes the width of the Gaussian
function in the time domain. By the above rate equation, we
ﬁtted the atomic density (solid line) in Fig. 3(a), which agrees
excellently with the experimental results.
Further investigations of the inﬂuence of the chip surface
on the transport of atoms are shown in Fig. 3(b), where the
atomic density distribution along the atom conveyor belt axis
for different holding times tis plotted. The origin of the z-
axis is set to the chip surface. The parameters of the conveyor
belt are the same as in Fig. 3(a). We found that when atoms
are close to the chip surface within 100 mm, the peak height of
atomic density distribution along the atom conveyor belt axis
decreases, which indicates an increased atom loss rate.
For future PAC experiments, a high density of atoms on5
the surface of the GaN-on-sapphire chip is desired. There-
fore, we experimentally varied the location of the MOT cen-
ter, and optimized the Dnmaxfor atom transportation. The re-
sults for maximum transport distance d=1000 mm, 750 mm,
and 500 mm are summarized in Fig. 4, with the atomic den-
sity on the chip surface calculated from the ﬁtting results, as
shown by the solid line of Fig. 3(a). The transport efﬁciency
his deﬁned as the ratio of the maximum atomic density on
the chip surface to the initial atomic density in the standing
wave dipole trap. Comparing the different Dnmaxin Fig. 4(a),
the transport efﬁciency reaches the optimum when Dnmaxis
100 160kHz, and the transport efﬁciency drops when Dnmax
is further increased. In particular, the efﬁciency dramatically
decreases when Dnmaxis less than 80kHz. The dependence
ofhonDnmaxmight be attributed to two different reasons.
IfDnmaxis too large, the acceleration and deceleration pro-
cess of the conveyor belt might induce a signiﬁcant loss of
atoms. Such phenomena have been studied in many other ex-
perimental works in detail [51, 52]. In contrast, if Dnmaxis
too small, the required tis too large, and the atomic density
is limited by the intrinsic atomic losses in the dipole trap. In
practical cases, we aim to obtain higher transport efﬁciency
along with less transport time. In Fig. 4(b), we present the
transport efﬁciency with corresponding transport time for dif-
ferent transport parameter. Shortening the transport distance
can improve both the transport efﬁciency and transport time,
and a maximum transport efﬁciency close to 50% is achieved
for a maximum transport distance of d=500mm. We ﬁt our
results with an empirical equation of the form
h=e at(bt+c) (4)
to describe the relation between transport efﬁciency with cor-
responding transport time. The exponential decay accounts
for the intrinsic loss irrelevant to the transport velocity, while
the linear term accounts for the improvement of transport ef-
ﬁciency with slow transport velocity. It is anticipated that the
transport efﬁciency can be improved by reducing the trans-
port distance. However, the disturbing of the MOT when it is
in the proximity of the chip surface prevent us from achieving
a shorter distance.
We also notice that the maximum transport efﬁciency is cur-
rently limited to about 50%. While nearly lossless atom trans-
port was achieved for a transport distance of a few milimeters
in free space [51], the reﬂection of the dipole trap beams on
the chip surface may destroy the moving lattice antinodes in
our cases. This issue might be mitigated by choosing an ap-
propriate polarization of the dipole trap beams with incident
angle satisfying the Brewster angle, since the reﬂection can be
greatly suppressed. Finally, the intrinsic heating of atoms in
the conveyor belt is tested in a static standing wave dipole trap
(Dnmax=0). As shown in Fig. 5, a heating rate of 12 :4mK =s
is extracted from the measurement of the trap lifetime for dif-
ferent trap depths, which explains the severe atomic loss when
Dnmax<80kHz.

IV . CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated a hybrid photonic-atomic chip plat-
form and successfully transported an ensemble of cold atoms
from free space towards the chip with an optical conveyor belt.
Our PAC platform is made of transparent materials, allowing
full optical access for free space laser cooling, atom transport,
and efﬁcient coupling to on-chip photonic waveguides. The
maximum transport efﬁciency of atoms is about 50% with
a transport distance of 500 mm. In the future, by combining
on-chip MOT laser cooling, optical transport and evanescent-
ﬁeld trapping of cold atoms, a more compact PAC platform is
attainable through the implementation of advanced photonic
structure fabrication and design strategies. Our PAC platform
holds great potential for studies of atom-photon interactions
and the realization of single-photon-level optical nonlinearity,
which could ﬁnd applications in quantum information science
and quantum sensing.
