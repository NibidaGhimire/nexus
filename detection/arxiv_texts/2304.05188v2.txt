Abstract
When implementing a non-linear constraint in quantum ﬁeld t heory by means of a Lagrange
multiplier, λpxq, it is often the case that quantum dynamics induce quadratic and even higher
order terms in λpxq, which then does not enforce the constraint anymore. This is illustrated
in the case of Unimodular Gravity, where the constraint is th at the metric tensor has to be
unimodular ( gpxq ”detgµνpxq “ ´1).Contents

Unimodular gravity (UG) is a variant of General Relativity (GR) origina lly conceived by
Einstein in 1919 (cf. [ 1] for a recent review) in which the zero mode component of the
vacuum energy does not weigh. This is the only fully satisfactory solu tion to at least part
of the well-known Cosmological Constant (CC) problem.
Thetheoryrestsontheassumptionthatonlyunimodularmetrics( gpxq ”detgµνpxq “
´1) are admissible. This poses a formidable problem in practice because it is a non-linear
constraint. There have been at least three attempts to implement this constraint, namely:
1. The simplest one consists in supplementing the GR lagrangian with a L agrange
multiplier term implementing the constraint either as

alongwiththestandardlinearsplitting gµνpxq “¯gµνpxq`κhµνpxq. Arecent example
of this is to be found in [ 2]. Note that the mass dimension of the multiplier is
rλpxqs “3 ind“4.
2. The second one just deﬁnes an auxiliary unrestricted metric gµνin terms of which
the unimodular metric is obtained
γµνpxq ”g´1{dpxqgµνpxq. (2)
This introduces a new Weyl gauge symmetry under
gµνpxq ÑΩ2pxqgµνpxq. (3)
This formalism has been used extensively in [ 3].
3. Finally, use can be made of the theorem on the eﬀect that any unim odular metric
is the exponential of a traceless one
gµνpxq “eGµνpxq, (4)
with
trGµνpxq “0. (5)
This has been used in [ 4,5,6,7].
The purpose of the present work is to examine the consistency of t he ﬁrst alternative
underquantumcorrections, althoughsomecommentswillalsobema deontheexponential
parametrization.
It is quite intuitive that the coupling of the multiplier with the graviton c an induce
divergent diagrams of higher order in the multipliers and even, in some cases kinetic
energy terms for them; see ﬁgs. 1and2below. Examples of related phenomena appear in
the principal chiral model [ 8] and in the physics of gravitons in a codimension one brane
[9], among others.
3The conclusion is that any consistent renormalization1must include ﬁnite values for
the coupling constants in front of these operators, which in turn c onveys the fact that the
Lagrange multiplier does not work as a multiplier anymore: it has becom e a full ﬂedge
ﬁeld with its own dynamics.
We shall, in fact, demonstrate in detail how the operator
O1”λpxq2, (6)
is generated by one-loop diagrams. We further argue, without exp licit calculation, that
a two-loop diagram will induce the kinetic energy correction
O2” pBµλpxqq2. (7)
To be speciﬁc, let gpxqdenote, as usual, the determinant of the metric. Assume that
theunimodularitycondition; gpxq “ ´1, isenforcedwiththeﬁrstalternativejustexposed,
i.e. by including in the path integral the additional contribution,

We want to explore the implications of such a gauge ﬁxing procedure when radiative

Consider gravitons, hµνpxqpropagating on a ﬂat background, ηµν, such that,

At the tree-level, the contribution to the 1PI function is linear in λpxqfor it is given by
eq. (8). However, radiative corrections yield, in fact, a one-loop contrib ution to the 1PI
functional quadratic in λpxq. Such contribution is given by the 1PI diagram in ﬁg. 1,

1Somebody could be tempted to put by hand all these coupling consta nts to zero. This would be most
unnatural; it is more or less equivalent to putting to zero all coupling c onstants in front of the higher
dimensional operators in quantum gravity; no known symmetry prin ciple supports this.

In this section we shall work out Γ Lppqin eq. (13) for quantum unimodular gravity as
deﬁned in [ 3] on the one side and [ 2] on the other.

The value of the coeﬃcients A1toA5depends, in general, on the set of ﬁelds introduced
by the BRST quantization procedure. The set of ﬁelds introduced in [3] is quite diﬀerent
from the set of ﬁelds in [ 2]. Let us then begin by adapting the BRST formalism of [ 3],
which was developed for the unrestricted metric in eq. ( 2), to our case.

3 A comment on GR in the unimodular gauge.
The phenomena discussed here also aﬀect GR in the unimodular gauge as discussed in
[11]. The propagator of GR has the same general form discussed abov e, with

The MS renormalization implies a counterterm

spoiling the working of the Lagrange multiplier as such. It is worth poin ting out that this
counterterm does not jeopardize the BRST quantization of GR, ow ing to the fact that it
is BRST exact. What it means is that the gauge ﬁxing fermion was not g eneral enough,
which is always a delicate issue for theories like GR that are not renorm alizable by power
counting.
Asimilar computationcanbecarried outforGRintheunimodular gauge asdeﬁned in
[12]. The result that one obtains is eq. ( 37), for it turns out that the graviton propagator
of [12] is the same as the graviton propagator from the unimodular theor y of [2].
94 A remark on the exponential parametrization.
Let us present a formal proof of the fact that this third approac h of the Introduction does
not suﬀer from this sickness, at least if the unimodularity condition is implemented by
adding to the action the termż

5 Comments and Conclusions.
Let us begin by pointing out that aside from the diagram here studied , one can expect
higher-loop diagrams making other terms involving λpxqpresent in the action, following
Gell-Mann’s totalitarian principle: whatever is not forbidden is compu lsory. In particular,
we expect diagrams such as those in ﬁg. 2give rise to kinetic terms for the λpxqﬁeld: the
1PI diagram in ﬁg. 2is quadratically divergent by power-counting.
At any rate, we have shown in this work that the imposition of the unim odular con-
straint in UG through a Lagrange multiplier does not survive, in gener al, quantum eﬀects;
unless the exponential parametrization is used appropriately. The se generate, in general,
(UV divergent) quadratic (and higher) order terms in the multiplier, as well of kinetic
energy contributions, all of which spoil the work of the Lagrange m ultiplier as such.
The only reasonable hypothetical cancellation of those diagrams wo uld be in an ap-
propriately quantized unimodular supergravity [ 13].
