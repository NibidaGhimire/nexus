Abstract. In the past few decades, much attention has been paid to the bubb ling problem
for semilinear Neumann elliptic equation with the critical and subcritica l polynomial non-
linearity, much less is known if the polynomial nonlinearity is replaced by the exponential
nonlinearity. In this paper, we consider the following semilinear Neuma nn elliptic problem
with the Trudinger-Moser exponential growth:/braceleftBigg
−d∆ud+ud=ud(eu2
d−1) in Ω,
∂ud
∂ν= 0 on ∂Ω,
whered >0 is a parameter, Ω is a smooth bounded domain in R2,νis the unit outer normal
to∂Ω. We ﬁrst prove the existence of a ground state solution to the ab ove equation. If d
is suﬃciently small, we prove that any ground state solution udhas at most one maximum
point which is located on the boundary of Ω and characterize the sha pe of ground state
solution udaround the condensation point Pd. The key point of the proof lies in proving
that the maximum point Pdis close to the boundary at the speed of√
dwhend→0 and
udunder suitable scaling transform converges strongly to the groun d state solution of the
limit equation ∆ w+w=w(ew2−1). Our proof is based on the energy threshold of cut-
oﬀ function, the concentration compactness principle for the Tru dinger-Moser inequality,
regularity theory for elliptic equation and an accurate analysis for t he energy of the ground
state solution udasd→0. Furthermore, by assuming that Ω is a unit disk, we remove the
smallness assumption on dand show the maximum point of ground state solution udmust
lie on the boundary of Ω for any d >0.

Let Ω be a bounded domain with smooth boundary in Rn(n≥3) andνdenotes the unit
outer normal to ∂Ω, the semilinear Neumann elliptic problem with the polynomial growth
(1.1)/braceleftBigg
−d∆ud+ud=up
din Ω,1< p≤n+2
n−2,
∂ud
∂ν= 0 on ∂Ω,
has been widely considered in the literature for more than 30 years. When 1< p <n+2
n−2, the
functional related to equation (1.1) satisﬁes the compactness co ndition, it is easy to prove
that there is a least energy solution for equation (1.1) (see [30]). Fu rthermore, in 1990s,
Ni and Takagi (see [41]) ﬁrst studied the location of maximum point of the ground state
solution ud. In their work, they proved that the ground state solution udof (1.1) has at
most one local maximum point PdinΩ which must lie on the boundary for dsuﬃciently
small. Furthermore, udalso exhibits the concentration phenomenon at the point Pd. More
precisely, udaroundPdcan be described as:
ud≈w/parenleftbig|x−Pd|
d/parenrightbig
,
wherewis the unique positive, radial solution to the problem
∆w−w+wp= 0inRn,lim
|x|→+∞w(x) = 0.
The asymptotic location of the point Pdwas also discussed in their papers and characterized
as
lim
d→0H∂Ω(Pd) = max
P∈∂ΩH∂Ω(P),
whereH∂Ωstands for the mean curvature of ∂Ω (see [42]). In [52], Wei studied the con-
struction of single and multiple spike-layer patterns for this problem and proved that if there
exists ap0∈∂Ω such that H∂Ω(p0)/\e}atio\slash= 0, then a solution of the form ud≈w/parenleftbig|x−Pd|
d/parenrightbig
can be
found with Pd→p0.
For the problem (1.1), one can not only exhibit sequences of solution s concentrating at
some point on the boundary ∂Ω, but also exhibit sequences of solutions concentrating on
higher dimension sets. Indeed, Malchiodi and Montenegro [33, 34, 35] constructed a se-
quence of solutions producing concentration phenomenon on the k-dimensional submanifold
Γ. More precisely, if Γ = ∂Ω or Γ is an embedded closed minimal submanifold of ∂Ω
and the corresponding Jacobi operator is non-singular, there ex ists a solution udsatisfying
ud≈w/parenleftbigdist(x,Γ)
d/parenrightbig
wherewis the unique positive, radial solution to the problem:
∆w−w+wp= 0inRn−k,lim
|x|→+∞w(x) = 0.
For the critical case p=n+2
n−2, the question becomes more complicated. Adimurthi and
Mancini in [1] and X. Wang in [51] showed that for dis small, the ground state solution
ud(Pd)→+∞asd→0 andudalso exhibits concentration phenomenon. We also refer
to the works of Rey [44, 45, 46], del Pino [9] and del Pino, Felmer and Wei [12], Ni, Pan
and Takagi [40], Gui, Wei and Winter [19], Gui and Ghoussoub [20], Wei [5 3, 54, 55], Lin,
Wang and Wei [31], Wang, Wei and Yan [50] and references therein fo r singular perturbation
problems with Neumann boundary conditions.
An interesting open conjecture related to the above semilinear Neu mann elliptic equation
states: for any d >0, does the non-constant ground state solution of equation (1.1) attain
its maximum at only one point Pd∈∂Ω. When Ω is a ball, Lin [29] gave a positive answer.BUBBLING PHENOMENON FOR SEMILINEAR EQUATIONS OF EXPONENTI AL GROWTH 3
Applying the method of moving planes to the Neumann elliptic problem, t hey removed the
assumption on dand obtained the following result:
Theorem A. ([29])Letudbe a ground state solution of (1.1)with1< p≤n+2
n−2and
Ω =BR(0).Suppose udis a nonconstant solution. Then udattains its local maximum
at only one point Pd,Pd∈∂BR(0).Furthermore, if we assume Pd= (0,···,0,R),then
udis increasing in xn,udis axially symmetric with respect to− − →OPd,and on each sphere

Itshould benotedthatthenonlinearity ofequation(1.1)with polyno mial growthhasbeen
considered by many authors because of the Sobolev imbedding theo rem:W1,2

for1≤q≤2n

0(Ω)
can be imbedded into the Orlicz space Lφαdetermined by the Young function φα(t) behaving
likeeαt2ast→+∞. A natural but non-trivial problem arises. Can Ni and Takagi’s resu lt
still hold if we replace the nonlinearity of equation (1.1) with critical ex ponential growth?
The main purpose of this paper is to solve these problems. Because t he proof of our results
needs some basic theory of the Trudinger-Moser inequality, for sim plicity, we will give a brief
history of the Trudinger-Moser inequality.
The Trudinger inequality as a borderline case of the Sobolev imbedding was obtained by
Trudinger [49] (see also Pohozhaev [43]). More precisely, he proved that there exists α >0
such that
(1.2) sup
/ba∇dbl∇u/ba∇dblnn≤1,u∈W1,n
0(Ω)/integraldisplay
Ωexp(α|u|n
n−1)dx <∞,
where Ω ⊆Rnis a smooth bounded domain and W1,p
0(Ω) denotes the usual Sobolev space,
i.e, the completion of C∞
0(Ω) with the norm
/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblW1,p
0(Ω)= (/integraldisplay
Ω(|∇u|p+|u|p)dx)1
p.
Subsequently, Trudinger inequality was sharpened by Moser in [39] b y showing that the
largestαin (1.2) is αn=nw1
n−1
n−1, whereωn−1is the surface measure of the unit sphere in
Rn. The inequality (1.2) in the case of α=αnis known as the Trudinger-Moser inequality.
So far, the Trudinger-Moser inequalities on bounded domains have b een generalized in other
settings such as on the CR spheres, compact Riemannian manifolds, Heisenberg group, we
refer the interested readers to [7], [8], [16], [27], [28] and the refere nces therein.
The concentration phenomenon and the singular perturbation pro blems with Dirichlet

by Struwe [47], Adimurthi and Struwe [2], Lamm, Robert and Struw e [24], del Pino, Musso

In this paper, we are interested in investigating the concentration phenomenon and the
singular perturbation problems with Neumann boundary conditions w hen the nonlinearities
are of critical exponential growth.
Now we are in a position to explain our main results. We focus on the pos itive solution
of the following semilinear Neumann elliptic equation with the Trudinger- Moser growth:

∂u
∂ν= 0 on ∂Ω,
whered >0, Ω is a smooth bounded domain in R2,νis the unit outer normal to ∂Ω.
Obviously, the functional Jd:W1,2(Ω)→Rassociated with equation (1.3) is deﬁned by

Ω(eu2−1)uvdxwithu,v∈W1,2(Ω). We recall
that the solution udof equation (1.4) is called a ground state solution if Jd(ud) =md:=
inf{Jd(u) :J′
d(u) = 0}. It is also easy to check that the functional energy of the ground state
solutionudcan also be characterized by min-max technique, that is
(1.5)md:= inf
h∈Γmax
0≤t≤1Jd(h(t)),Γ :={h∈ C([0,1],W1,2(Ω)) :h(0) = 0,Jd(h(1))<0}.
To our knowledge, we have not seen any existence result for groun d state solutions of
equation (1.3). For the reader’s convenience, we ﬁrst establish th e existence of ground state
solutions to this equation.
Theorem 1.1. For anyd >0, the equation (1.4)admits a positive ground state solution ud.
Remark 1.2. Theproof combinesthe Trudinger-Moserinequality, thecon centration-compactness
principle for Trudinger-Moser inequality in W1,2(Ω)and Nehari manifold method.
Obviously, equation (1.3) has two constant solutions u≡0 andu≡ln1
22. Remark 2.2
yields that ud/\e}atio\slash≡Cprovided that dis suﬃciently small. Furthermore, we also obtain
Theorem 1.3. Letudbe a ground state solution of (1.3). Ifdis suﬃciently small, then ud
has at most one local maximum at Pd∈Ω. Furthermore, Pdmust lie on the boundary ∂Ω.
The proof of Theorem 1.3 is quite involved. The key idea is to prove tha t the distance
between the maximum point Pdand the boundary satisﬁes d(Pd,∂Ω)/lessorsimilard1
2and show that
udunder suitable scaling transform converges strongly to the groun d state solution of the
limit equation −∆w+w=w(ew2−1). The presence of critical exponential growth makes
this problem nontrivial. One can not just follow the same line of Ni and T agaki [41] to
obtain the desired conclusion. Our proof combines the gradient est imate of cut-oﬀ function,
the concentration compactness principle for Trudinger-Moser ine quality, regularity theory
for elliptic equation and a more accurate analysis for the energy of t he ground state solution
udasd→0.
Theorem 1.4. Suppose that udis a ground state solution of (1.3)which achieves its max-
imum at Pd∈∂Ω. Then for any ε >0, there is a constant d0and a subdomain Ω(ε)
d⊂Ω
such that for 0< d < d 0, there holds:

whereΨ(x)is a function deﬁned in (3.13),δ(x) = min{d(x,∂Ω(ε)
d),η0}andC,C1,µ1and
η0are positive constants depending only on Ω.
Theorem 1.4 characterizes the concentration behavior of ground state solution udaround
the maximum point Pdwhendis small. When Ω is a special region such as unit disk, we
can remove the smallness assumption on dand prove that for any d >0, the maximum-
point of ground state solution udmust lie on the boundary ∂D. Indeed, applying the local
moving-plane method developed by Lin in [29], we obtain the following res ult:
Theorem 1.5. Suppose udis a ground state solution of equation (1.3)withΩreplaced by
unit disk DinR2. Ifudis a nonconstant solution, then for any d >0,ud(x)has only one
extremal point Pdwhich achieves its maximum. Furthermore, Pdmust lie on the boundary
∂D.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we apply the concent ration compactness
principle for Trudinger-Moser inequality in W1,2(Ω) and Nehari manifold method to get the
existence of ground state solutions and give the proof of Theorem 1.1. Section 3 is devoted
to some necessary lemmas. In the spirit of Berestycki and Lions’ w ork [4] and combining
the method of moving planes in integral form developed by Chen, Li a nd Ou [6], we obtain
that any positive solutions of Schr¨ odinger equation with the Trudin ger-Moser growth (1.4) is
radial and decays exponentially at inﬁnity. By constructing an appr opriate sequence ϕdand
computing M[ϕd], we establish the relationship between md,I(w) and the mean curvature
of∂Ω atP, wherew=w(z) is the ground state solution of Schr¨ odinger equation (1.4) and P
is the limiting point of Pd. In Section 4, we establish the phenomenon of point condensation
and show the shape of the ground state solution udaround the condensation point Pd. In
Section 5, we consider phenomenon of point condensation on unit ba llDand show that
for every d >0,udhas only one extremal point Pd∈∂Dthrough the local moving-plane
method in Theorem 1.5.

3.Some necessary lemmas
In this section, we give some lemmas which play a key role in the proofs o f Theorem 1.3
and 1.4. First, we claim that the positive solution of equation
(3.1)/braceleftBigg
−∆u+u=u(eu2−1) inR2,
u∈W1,2(R2)
is radially symmetric up to some translation and decays exponentially a t inﬁnity.
Lemma 3.1. Assumeuis a weak solution of (1.4), thenuis a radial solution satisfying
lim
|x|→+∞u(x) = 0. Moreover, |u(r)|and|u′(r)|decay exponentially at inﬁnity. i.e. there exists
θ >0such that |u|,|u′(r)| ≤e−θrforrsuﬃciently large.
Proof.Letu∈W1,2(R2) be a solution of −∆u+u=u(eu2−1), by Green’s representation
formula, we can write
u(x) =/integraldisplay
R2G(x−y)u(eu2−1)dy,
whereG(x−y) is the Green function of the Schr¨ odinger operator −∆+IinR2and decays
exponentially at inﬁnity. Using Trudinger-Moser inequality in W1,2(R2) and Lebesgue dom-
inated convergence theorem, one can easily obtain lim
|x|→+∞u(x) = 0. Furthermore, one can
use the method of moving planes in the integral form as developed by Chen, Li and Ou [6]
as done in [3] to derive that uis radial. Now, we adopt the method originally appeared in
the work of Berestycki and Lions’ paper [4] to prove that uand|u′(r)|decay exponentially
at inﬁnity.

Combining lim

s=−1 with equation (3.2), one can see that for rsuﬃ-
ciently large, there holds
(3.3) vrr≥1
2v.
Deﬁnew=v2, simple calculations show that
wr= 2vvr,1

Thanks to equation (3.3), we deduce that for r > r0,

wherer0is a positive constant such that |g(u(r))

4forr > r0. Therefore, we have
w≥0 andwrr> wforr > r0. Letz=e−r(wr+w). Then zr=e−r(wrr−w). It follows
from (3.5) that
zr>0 forr > r0.
We claim that for any r > r0,z(r)≤0. Assume there exists r1> r0such that z(r1)>0,
thenz(r)≥z(r1)>0 forr > r1which yields that
z(r1)er≤wr+w= 2vvr+v2=u2+ruur+ru2. (3.6)
Since lim
r→+∞u(r) = 0, thenz(r1)er
r3is not integrable on R2andu2+ruur+ru2
r3is integrable on R2.
This is a contradiction. Hence
z(r)≤0 forr≥r0,
which implies that
(3.7) ( erw)r=e2rz≤0 forr≥r0.
As a result, we can get that w(r)≤ce−rforr≥r0. Thus

we devoted ourself to deﬁning an appropriate function ϕdand computing M[ϕd]. We need
some preparation at ﬁrst.
For any ﬁxed P∈∂Ω, select the coordinate system with origin at Pand the inner normal
to∂Ω atPis the positive y-axis. Then we introduce a diﬀeomorphism which straightens
a boundary portion near P∈∂Ω. Since Pis the origin and the inner normal at Pis the
positivey-axis, one can pick a smooth function ϕdeﬁned on {x∈Ω/vextendsingle/vextendsingle|x|< δ}such that
i)ϕ(0) = 0 and ϕ′(0) = 0;
ii)∂Ω∩Br(0) ={(x,y)|y=ϕ(x)}and Ω∩Br(0) ={(x,y)|y > ϕ(x)},
where 0< r < δ. Forz∈R2with|z| ≪1, deﬁne a function x= Φ(z) = (Φ 1(z),Φ2(z)) by
(3.13)/braceleftBigg
Φ1(z) =z1−ϕ′(z1),
Φ2(z) =z2+ϕ(z1).
Then it follows from ϕ′(0) = 0 that DΦ(0) =I. As a consequence, there exists a converse
mapping z= Φ−1(x) =: Ψ(x) = (Ψ 1(x),Ψ2(x)) for|z|< δ′. Let 0<3k < δ, thenx= Φ(z)
can be deﬁned in Bδ(0) and Φ( B+
3k(0))⊆Ω where B+

4.Proofs of Theorems 1.3 and 1.4
In this section, we focus on the shape of ground state solution udaround its condensation
pointPd. Indeed, we show that udexhibits ”phenomenon of point condensation” in Theorem
1.3 and give a description of udnearPdin Theorem 1.4. The proof of Theorem 1.3 is
divided into three steps. Step 1 states that the maximum point Pdis very close to the
boundary, namely d(Pd,∂Ω) =O(√
d).Pdis located on the boundary and udhas at most
one local maximum point are discussed in Step 2 and Step 3. The basic id ea of the proof
is to approximate udaroundPdby a scaled positive radial solution. We apply energy
threshold of the ground state solution mdj<4djπ, a cut-oﬀ function, the concentration
compactness principle for Trudinger-Moser inequality, regularity t heory for elliptic equation
and an accurate analysis on mdasd→0 (see Proposition 3.8) to overcome the diﬃculty
caused by the Trudinger-Moser growth.
Proof of Theorem 1.3: Suppose udachieves its local maximum at Pd∈Ω. The proof is
devided into three steps.
Step 1.For 0< d≪1, we claim that there exists a C∗>0 such that
(4.1) d(Pd,∂Ω)≤C∗d1
2.
Suppose (4.1) not hold, then there exists a sequence of ( dj)jsatisfying dj→0 such that as
j→+∞,
(4.2) ρj:=d−1

jd(Pdj,∂Ω)→+∞.

Through direct calculations, we see that vjsatisﬁes the equation
−∆vj+vj=vj(ev2
j−1) inBρj.
Thenwesplit theproofof (4.1)into two parts. Intheﬁrstpart, we show that {vj}jconverges
towwhich is a solution to −∆w+w=f(w) up to a sequence. The second part talks about
a lower bound of mdj. Sinceudjis a ground state solution, we have

which implies that
(4.12) /ba∇dblvj/ba∇dblL∞(BR)≤C′.
Therefore, we can apply the regularity theorem for Laplace equat ion (see [18]) to derive that
(4.13) /ba∇dblvj/ba∇dblC1,θ(BR)≤C1, j≥jm,
whereθ∈(0,1). Then it follows from interior Schauder estimate in BR
2that forj≥jm,
(4.14) /ba∇dblvj/ba∇dblC2,θ(BR
2)≤C2.
Obviously, {vj}jis uniformly bounded and equicontinuous in C2(BR
2) which implies that
{vj}jis a relatively compact set. Since 0 < R <ρj
2is arbitrary and ρj→+∞asj→+∞,
we can select a subsequence of {vj}j(for simplicity, we still denote it by {vj}j) such that
vj→winC2

Clearly,w∈ C2(R2)/intersectiontextW2,q(R2) andwis a solution of −∆w+w=f(w). Then, we claim
that

which is a contradiction with ∆ vj(0)≤0. Thus, one can get (4.15) which yields that
w(0)≥0 andw/\e}atio\slash≡0. The strong maxmium principle results in w >0. With the help of
Lemma 3.1, we derive that
(4.16) 0 < w(r)≤C0exp(−µr),

Applying Lemma 3.1, one can derive that |w(r)| ≤e−θrforrsuﬃciently large. Let Rbe a

kαkandεRas deﬁned in Step 1. One can pick KR>0 such
that fork > K R,
(4.41) /ba∇dblwk−w/ba∇dblC2(B4R)≤εR.
Next, we show that wkhas only one local maximum point in BR. As discussed in (4.15), we
seew(0) = lim k→+∞wk(0)≥ln1
22 which yields
w′′(0)<0.
Therefore, we can pick two numbers aandbsatisfying 0 < a < bsuch that (i) w′′(r)<0,
∀r∈[0,a] and (ii) w(b)<ln1
22. Since wis strictly decreasing, then c∗:= min{|w′(r)||r∈
[a,b]}>0. For|z| ∈[a,b], one can employ (4.41) to derive that for any εR< c∗,
|∇wk(z)| ≥ |∇w(z)|−|∇wk(z)−∇w(z)| ≥c∗−εR>0,
which implies that wk(z) is decreasing in [ a,b]. Then one can apply Lemma 4.2 (see [41])
in the ball Baand obtain that the origin is the unique local maximum point of wk. This
together with wk(z) is decreasing in [ a,b], we see z= 0 is the unique local maximum point of
wkinBb. Forzk∈BR\Bb, onecanchoose εR<ln1
22−w(b)togetwk(z)≤w(z)+εR<ln1

Therefore there is no local maximum point in BR\Bb. As a consequence, zk= 0. Hence, /tildewidehk
has the only local maximum point and αk= 0. Step 2 is ﬁnished.
Step 3.We will prove that udhas at most one local maximum point. Otherwise, there is
a decreasing sequence {dk}converges to 0 such that udkachieves its local maximum at Pk

k. From the arguments of Step 1 and Step 2, we see Pk∈∂Ω,P′
k∈∂Ω. Since wkhas

As discussed in Step 2, we introduce y= Ψ(x) which deﬁned near the accumulation

5.Proof of Theorem 1.5
In this section, we give the proof of Theorem 1.5. The following lemma p lays a key role
in managing the rotating plane method to prove Theorem 1.5.
Lemma 5.1. Assumeudis a ground state solution of equation (1.3)andPdis a maximum
point ofud. ThenPd/\e}atio\slash= 0andudis axially symmetric with respect to the line− − →OPd. Moreover,
if we assume Pdlocated on the positive x2-axis, then we have

∂x2−x2∂ud
∂x1>0forx1>0.
Proof.We split the proof into four steps.
Step 1. We claim that udis not radially symmetric and prove it by contradiction. Assume
udis radially symmetric, then the ﬁrst eigenfunction φ1for the linearized equation is radially
symmetric. Since∂ud
∂x1(x) =u′
d(|x|)x1
|x|andφ1is radially symmetric, one can easily get that
∂ud
∂x1andφ1are orthogonal in L2(Rn). Through boundary condition, for x∈∂D, we have
∂ud
∂x1(x) =u′
d(1)x1
|x|= 0. Since udis a ground state solution of equation (1.3), it is not diﬃcult26 LU CHEN, GUOZHEN LU AND CAIFENG ZHANG
to check that the second eigenvalue µ2of the linearized equation (1.3) is nonnegative. Hence
it follows that

22. This contradicts with udbeing a nonconstant solution. Hence, udis
not radially symmetric.
Step 2. Forx∈D+, letw(x) =u(x)−u(x−),x−= (x1,−x2). Then we prove that for
x∈D+,w(x)≥0 orw(x)≤0. Assume it is not true, deﬁne Ω +and Ω −as follows which
are nonempty:
Ω+:={x∈D+|w(x)>0},Ω−={x∈D+|w(x)<0}.

which contracts with (5.6). Therefore, w(x)≥0 orw(x)≤0 for∈D+.
Step 3.Pd/\e}atio\slash= 0 and if we suppose Pdlocated on the positive x2-axis, then
(5.8) w(x) =u(x)−u(x−)>0.
We prove Pd/\e}atio\slash= 0 by contradiction. If Pd= 0, we claim that w(x)≡0. Otherwise, for
x∈D+,w(x)/\e}atio\slash≡0. Thanks to Step 2 and the strong maximum principle, we have w(x)>0
for anyx∈D+. With the help of Hopf lemma, we get
−∂w
∂x2(0) =−2∂u
∂x2(0)<0.
However, Pdis a maximum point yields that∂u
∂x2= 0. Thus, we get a contradiction and
w(x)≡0. Managing the similar progress on x1, one can obtain the radial symmetry of ud
which contradicts with Step 1. Hence, Pd/\e}atio\slash= 0. Without loss of generality, we assume Pdis
located on the positive x2-axis.
To prove (5.8), we redenote Ω +and Ω −as
Ω+:={x∈D+|w(x)>0},Ω−:={x∈D+|w(x)<0}.
Suppose Ω +is empty, then we have w(x)≤0 onD+. This together with w(Pd)≥0 yields
thatw(Pd) = 0. Thanks to the strong maximum principle, one can easily get that w(x)≡0
which implies that 0 is a maximum point. However we already have Pd/\e}atio\slash= 0. Therefore the
assumption fails and Ω +is not empty. Then one can manage the similar proof as step 2 to
get Ω−is empty. Therefore inequality (5.8) is established.
Step 4: In this step, we apply the method of rotating planes to prove that udis axially
symmetric with respect to the line− − →OPd. Without loss of generality, we assume Pdlocated
on the positive x2-axis. For any θ∈[0,π
2),lθdenotes the line
{(tcosθ,tsinθ)}.
Letxθbe the reﬂection point of xwith respect to lθ, Σθbe the component which contains
Pd. Deﬁne a function vθon Σθby
vθ(x) =ud(x)−ud(xθ).
Direct calculations show that
(5.9)/braceleftBigg

Denote
θ0:= sup{θ|v/tildewideθ(x)≥0,∀x∈Σ/tildewideθ,0≤/tildewideθ≤θ <π
2}.
Then we will show θ0=π
2and argue it by contradiction. Assume θ0<π
2, one can get that
vθ0(x)≥0 forx∈Σθ0through continuity. Notice that udis a nonconstant solution, one can
derive that vθ0(Pd)>0. Since if vθ0(Pd) = 0 and θ0<π
2, one can apply the strong maximum
principle to obtain that vθ(x)≡0 andudis radial.
Thanks to the fact vθ0(x)≥0 forx∈Σθ0andvθ0(Pd)>0, one can employ the Hopf
lemma to derive that vθ0(x)>0 forx∈Σθ\lθ0and∂vθ0
∂ν(x)<0 forx∈lθ0\∂D. Choosing a
sequence of θj> θ0converges to θ0such that
vθj(xj) = inf
Σθvθj(x)<0.
Up to a sequence, xjconverges to x0. One can easily get that vθ0(x0) = 0 and ∇vθ0(x0) = 0.
Thus,x0∈lθ0/intersectiontext∂D. Lete1,jbe the base of lθjande1= limj→+∞e1,j, thene1is the base
forlθ0. Note that vθ0≡0 onlθ0, one can obtain that
De1De1vθ0(x0) = 0.
Forxj∈Σθ∩D, it is easy to see that
(5.10) De1,jvθj(xj) = 0 and De1,jvθj(ˆxj) = 0,
where ˆxjis the projection of xjonlθj. Ifxj∈Σθ∩∂D, one can apply the fact e1,jis
perpendicular to the outnormal of ∂Dand tangent to ∂Datxjto derive inequality (5.10).
Following from the mean value theorem, we have
De2De1vθ0(x0) = 0.
Combining this with equation (5.10), one can get De2De2vθ0(x0) = 0. Since the Hessian of
vθ0atx0vanishes which contradicts with S-Lemma in [17]. Hence, we derive that θ0=π
2and
ud(x)≥ud(xπ
2). If we rotate planes in the opposite direction, then we have ud(x)≤ud(xπ
2)
which yields that ud(x) is symmetric with respect to x1. Thus axial symmetry follows. For
inequality (5.1), one can apply∂vθ
∂ν(x)<0 onlθto derive it. Therefore, we complete the
proof. /square
Proof of Theorem 1.5: Without loss of generality, one can assume that Pdis located on
the positive x2-axis. Since udis axially symmetric with respect to the x2-axis, one can apply
direct calculations to know that

∂x2(x) = 0 when
x= (0,±1). Therefore
(5.14)∂ud
∂x2(x)>0, x∈∂D\(0,±1).
Then, we claim that

which is a contradiction with inequality (5.18). Hence, inequality (5.15) holds.
Based on inequalities (5.14) and (5.15), we will employ MMP to derive a co ntradiction.
Suppose Pd= (0,td) andtd<1. For any t≥0, denote
wt(x) =ud(x)−ud(xt),forx2≥t,30 LU CHEN, GUOZHEN LU AND CAIFENG ZHANG
wherext= (x1,2t−x2). Fort= 0, we have proved w0(x)>0 forx2>0. Deﬁne
t0= sup{t < td| ∀x2≥s,0≤s≤t,ws(x)≥0}.
Then, we claim that t0< td. Sincewt(x) is continuous, we have wt0(x)≥0 forx2≥t0.
Through applying the Hopf lemma to wt(x) onx2=t, one can derive that for 0 ≤t≤t0,
x2< t, there holds∂ud(x)
∂x2>0.This together with inequality (5.15) yields that
(5.20)∂ud(x)
∂x2>0,forx2< t0.
Moreover, by the strong maximum principle, we know that either wt0(x)≡0 orwt0(x)>0
forx2> t0. Ifwt0(x)≡0 forx2> t0, then for x2> t0,
∂wt0(x)
∂x2= 0.
However, if xis located on the boundary, inequality (5.14) and the Neumann condit ion gives
that∂ud(x)
∂x2≥0. Combine this with inequality (5.20), one can derive that
∂wt0(x)
∂x2=∂ud(x)
∂x2+∂ud(xt0)
∂x2>0,
which contradicts with∂wt0(x)
∂x2= 0. Therefore wt0(x)>0 forx2> t0. Thanks to the Hopf
lemma again, we can obtain that for x2=t0,
(5.21) 2∂ud(x)
∂x2=∂wt0(x)
∂x2>0.
SincePdis a maximum point, we get∂ud(x)
∂x2= 0 forx2=td. Therefore t0< td.
Oncet0< tdholds, one can pick tj> t0andtj→t0such that
wtj(xj) = inf
x∈D∩{x2≥tj}wtj(x)<0.(5.22)
Ifxjlies on the boundary, one can obtain that
0≥∂wtj(xj)
∂x2=∂ud(xj)
∂x2+∂ud(xtj
j)
∂x2≥∂ud(xtj
j)
∂x2>0.
Therefore, one can get xj∈D∩ {xn≥tj}. Up to a sequence, xj→x∞asj→+∞. By
the deﬁnition of x∞, we have wt0(x∞) = 0 and∂wt0(x∞)
∂x2= 0. Notice that wt0(x)>0 when
x2> t0, hencex∞∈ {x2=t0}and
0 =∂wt0(x∞)
∂x2= 2∂ud(x∞)
∂x2,
which contradicts with∂ud(x∞)
∂x2>0. Therefore, td= 1 and Pdis located on the boundary.
