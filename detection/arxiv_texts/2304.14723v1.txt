Abstract: We consider a second-order nonlinear wave equation with a li near convolution term. When the convolution
operator is taken as the identity operator, our equation red uces to the classical elasticity equation which can be writt en
as ap-system of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations. We ﬁrst estab lish the local well-posedness of the Cauchy problem. We
then investigate the behavior of solutions to the Cauchy pro blem in the limit as the kernel function of the convolution
integral approaches to the Dirac delta function, that is, in the vanishing dispersion limit. We consider two diﬀerent ty pes
of the vanishing dispersion limit behaviors for the convolu tion operator depending on the form of the kernel function.
In both cases, we show that the solutions converge strongly t o the corresponding solutions of the classical elasticity
equation.
Key words: Nonlinear elasticity, Long wave limit, Vanishing dispersi on limit, Nonlocal
1. Introduction
Assuming that u=u(x,t) is a real-valued function and gis a suﬃciently smooth nonlinear function satisfying
g(0) =g′(0) = 0, we consider the nonlocal nonlinear equation
utt=Buxx+g(u)xx, (1.1)
whereBis the convolution operator in the x-variable with the kernel (measure) µ:
(Bu)(x) = (µ∗u)(x) =/integraldisplay
Ru(x−y)dµ(y).
Throughout the manuscript we assume that µis an even ﬁnite Borel measure on R. Being even implies that
the Fourier transform /hatwideµ(ξ) of the measue µ(x) is real. We further assume that, for some constants c1,c2,
0< c1≤/hatwideµ(ξ)≤c2. (1.2)
We note that the right-hand side of the inequality above is trivial with c2=|µ|(R). This condition implies that
the operator Bis a positive bounded operator on the Sobolev space Hs(R) for any s.

If the operator Bis taken to be the identity operator I(that is, if the kernel is the Dirac delta measure
δ), (1.1) reduces to the classical elasticity equation
utt=uxx+g(u)xx (1.3)
written in dimensionless variables. Equation ( 1.3) is hyperbolic whenever g′(u)>−1. It models the non-
dispersive propagation of longitudinal waves in an elastic bar of inﬁnit e length, where udenotes the strain
deﬁned by u=wxwherew(x,t) represents axial displacement at position xand time t. On the other hand,
the linear dispersion relation ξ/ma√sto→ω2(ξ) =ξ2/hatwideµ(ξ) of (1.1) shows the dispersive nature of the solutions. So the
convolution operator Bis responsible for dispersion of wave solutions to ( 1.1).
It is worth mentioning that the class ( 1.1) of nonlocal nonlinear wave equations covers various models of
dispersive wave propagation. A typical example for the measure µisµ=δ+βwhereδis the Dirac measure
andβis an even L1(R) function such that 0 < c1≤1+/hatwideβ(ξ) for some c1. In this case ( 1.1) takes the form
utt=uxx+β∗uxx+g(u)xx (1.4)
with the usual convolution operator
(β∗u)(x) =/integraldisplay
Rβ(x−y)u(y)dy.
We also note that the class ( 1.1) is closely related to the nonlinearly regularized wave equation
utt=β∗/parenleftbig
uxx+g(u)xx/parenrightbig
(1.5)
considered in [ 3,5] in which the convolution operator acts on both the linear and nonline ar terms. We stress
that the members of the linearly and nonlinearly regularized classes o f nonlinear wave equations are totally
diﬀerent from each other. For instance, if the kernel function βin (1.4) is taken as the exponential kernel
β(x) =1
2e−|x|in which B=I+(1−D2
x)−1, (1.1) reduces to
utt−2uxx−uxxtt+uxxxx=g(u)xx−g(u)xxxx. (1.6)
However, if we take the same exponential kernel in the nonlinearly r egularized class ( 1.5) considered in [ 3,5],
we get the improved Boussinesq equation utt−uxx−uxxtt=g(u)xx. To get an another member of the class
(1.4), we now consider the triangular kernel deﬁned by β(x) =1
h/parenleftbig
1−|x|
h/parenrightbig
for|x| ≤handβ(x) = 0 for
|x|> hwherehis a positive constant. If the kernel βis taken as the triangular kernel, ( 1.4) reduces to the
diﬀerential-diﬀerence equation
utt=uxx+∆hu+g(u)xx, (1.7)
where ∆ his thesecond-ordercentraldiﬀerenceoperatordeﬁned by (∆ hu)(x) =/parenleftbig
u(x+h)−2u(x)+u(x−h)/parenrightbig
/h2.
However, if βin the nonlinearly regularized wave equation ( 1.5) is taken as the triangular kernel, we get the
diﬀerential-diﬀerenceequation utt= ∆h(u+g(u)) in [3,5]. When this lastequationis writtenin termsof w(x,t)
deﬁned by u(x,t) =/parenleftbig
w(x+h,t)−w(x,t)/parenrightbig
/h, it becomes the famous Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou equation that
describes longitudinal vibrations of an inﬁnite chain of identical part icles [6]. We refer the reader to Section 7
of [5] for more details.

Inthe presentworkweareconcernedwith twoissues; thelocalwe ll-posednessof( 1.1)andtheconvergence
of the solutions of ( 1.1) to the solutions of ( 1.3) asBapproaches the identity operator I. The second issue is
about the vanishing dispersion (vanishing nonlocality) limit of strong s olutions to the Cauchy problem for ( 1.1).
Thisissueisinspiredbytheconvergenceresultin[ 5]wheretheconvergencefromaclassofnonlinearlyregularized
wave equations to the classical elasticity equation was established. We extend here the approach developed in
[5] to the linearly regularized wave equation ( 1.1). For this aim we ﬁrst parameterize ( 1.1) by replacing the
operator Bby the family of convolution operators Bε. We then consider two slightly diﬀerent approaches for
the vanishing dispersion limit. In the ﬁrst approach the operators a re given by Bε= (δ+εβ)∗with a small
parameter ε, a ﬁxed L1function βand the Dirac measure δ. Obviously, as ε→0,Bεconvergesto the identity
operator Iand we get ( 1.3). In the second approach the operatorsare Bε=µε∗withµε(x) =1√εµ(x√ε). When
/integraltext
Rµ dx= 1,Bεconverges to Iasε→0 and we get again ( 1.3). We note that in the second approach we can
get the parameterized form of ( 1.1) using the transformation ( x,t,u)→(x/√ε,t/√ε,u) in (1.1). So the second
approach corresponds to the long-wave limit of ( 1.1). In both approaches we show that the diﬀerence between
the corresponding solutions of ( 1.1) and (1.3) with the same initial data remains small if the dispersive eﬀect is
suﬃciently small.
The plan of this paper is as follows. In Section 2we prove the local well-posedness of the Cauchy problem
for the linear system associated with ( 1.1). In Section 3we establish the local well-posedness of the Cauchy
problem for ( 1.1). In Section 4we show that, in the vanishing dispersion limit, solutions of the Cauchy problem
for (1.1) converge to the corresponding solution of ( 1.3).
Throughout this paper we will follow the standard notation for func tion spaces and norms. The Fourier

respectively. Finally, the notations Λs= (1−D2

remainder of this study.
2. Local well-posedness for the linear system
To prove our estimates below and in the next sections, we will need th e following commutator estimates given
in [7] and, for more general operators σ(Dx), in [8] respectively:
Lemma 2.1 Lets≥0. Then for all f,gsatisfying f∈Hs,Dxf∈L∞,g∈Hs−1∩L∞,

L2≤C/bardblfx/bardblHt0/bardblg/bardblHr−1. (2.1)
The Cauchy problem
ut=vx, u (x,0) =u0(x), (2.2)
vt=Bux+g′(u)ux, v(x,0) =v0(x) (2.3)
is equivalent to the Cauchy problem deﬁned by ( 1.1) and the initial data u(x,0) =u0(x),ut(x,0) = (v0(x))x.
We note that if Bis takenasthe identity operator, ( 2.2)-(2.3) reducesto the Cauchyproblemforthe well-known
p-system: ut=vx,vt=ux+(g(u))x. Thep-system appears in a number of physical applications, such as to
describe the one-dimensional motion of elastic solids or the isentrop ic gas dynamics in Lagrangian coordinates
(for more on the p-system see, for instance, [ 9,11]).
We now consider the linear problem
ut=vx, u (x,0) =u0(x), (2.4)
vt=Bux+wux, v(x,0) =v0(x), (2.5)
wherew=w(x,t) is a given ﬁxed function satisfying the following condition
0< d1≤c1+w(x,t)≤d2for all (x,t)∈R×[0,T] (2.6)
for some constants d1,d2and ﬁxed T >0 and the lower bound c1for/hatwideµgiven in ( 1.2). Note that the above
inequality for wis satisﬁed whenever /bardblw(t)/bardblL∞is small enough. Alternatively, another possibility is the case
wherewis bounded and nonnegative. We also note that the hyperbolicity of t he linearized system ( 2.4)-(2.5)
is guaranteed by the conditions ( 1.2) and (2.6). For the linearized system ( 2.4)-(2.5) we deﬁne the Hs”energy”

By (2.6),E2

to (2.4)-(2.5) for both a ﬁxed w∈Yssatisfying ( 2.6) and initial values u0,v0∈Hs. For the existence proof
of the linearized system, we follow Taylor’s hyperbolic approach [ 10]. In that respect we consider Friederichs

will be used throughout the rest of the study. The molliﬁed system is then
ut=Jhvx, u (x,0) =u0(x), (2.9)
vt=BJhux+wJhux, v(x,0) =v0(x). (2.10)
Being an Hs×Hs-valued linear ODE system, ( 2.9)-(2.10) has unique solution uh,vh∈Xs.

where we have used ( 2.13). Regarding the ﬁrst two integrals on the right-hand side of ( 2.14) we have the
following two inequalities respectively:
/integraldisplay

/integraldisplay
Rwx/parenleftbig
Λsu/parenrightbig/parenleftbig
ΛsJhv/parenrightbig
dx≤ /bardblwx/bardblL∞/bardblu/bardblHs/bardblv/bardblHs. (2.16)
To get a similar estimate for the last integral in ( 2.14) we make use of the commutator estimates in Lemmas
2.1and2.2. Using [Λs,f]g= Λs(fg)−fΛsg, a part of the integrand in the last integral can be written as
Λs/parenleftbig
wJhux/parenrightbig
−Jh/parenleftbig
wΛsux/parenrightbig
= [Λs,w]Jhux−[Jh,w]Λsux. (2.17)
5ERBAY et al./Turk J Math
Regarding the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of ( 2.17), by Lemma 2.1we have
/vextenddouble/vextenddouble[Λs,w]Jhux/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
L2≤C/parenleftbig
/bardblwx/bardblL∞/bardblJhux/bardblHs−1+/bardblw/bardblHs/bardblJhux/bardblL∞/parenrightbig
or, when s >3/2,
/vextenddouble/vextenddouble[Λs,w]Jhux/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
L2≤C/bardblw/bardblHs/bardblu/bardblHs. (2.18)
Now, regarding the second term on the right-hand side of ( 2.17) we will use the estimate ( 2.1) withr= 0.
From (2.1) we have
/vextenddouble/vextenddouble[Jh,w]Λsux/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
L2≤C/bardblwx/bardblHt0/bardblΛsux/bardblH−1≤C/bardblw/bardblHt0+1/bardblΛsu/bardblL2. (2.19)
If we take s=t0+1>3/2, we get
/vextenddouble/vextenddouble[Jh,w]Λsux/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
L2≤C/bardblw/bardblHs/bardblu/bardblHs. (2.20)
So, using the results obtained in ( 2.15), (2.16), (2.18) and (2.20), fors >3/2 we get
d

s≤C/bardblw/bardblYsE2
s, (2.21)
from (2.14). Gronwall’s inequality yields the result ( 2.11). ✷
In the remaining parts of this study we require some extensions of L emma2.3. For this purpose we now state
the following two remarks regarding the systems associated with ( 2.9)-(2.10)
Remark 2.4 For the nonhomogeneous system
ut=Jhvx+F1, u (x,0) =u0(x), (2.22)
vt=BJhux+wJhux+F2, v(x,0) =v0(x), (2.23)
the estimate ( 2.21) of Lemma 2.3becomes

s+C/parenleftbig
/bardblF1/bardblHs+/bardblF2/bardblHs/parenrightbig
Es (2.24)
withs >3/2.
Remark 2.5 The conclusions of Lemma 2.3and Remark 2.4also hold when Jhis replaced by the identity
operator I.
We now proceed with the proof of the local well-posedness of ( 2.4)-(2.5). Since /bardbluh(t)/bardbl2
Hs+/bardblvh(t)/bardbl2
Hs≈
E2
s(t) for solution ( uh,vh) of (2.9)-(2.10), Lemma 2.3shows that uhandvhare bounded in Xsand thus there
is a subsequence ( uhk,vhk) weakly converging to some ¯ u,¯v∈Xsashk→0. To show the strong convergence
we introduce the diﬀerences p=uhk−uhmandq=vhk−vhm. Then, from ( 2.9)-(2.10) we get
pt=Jhkqx+F1, p (x,0) = 0, (2.25)
qt=BJhkpx+wJhkpx+F2, q(x,0) = 0, (2.26)
6ERBAY et al./Turk J Math
where
F1= (Jhk−Jhm)(vhm)x (2.27)
F2=B(Jhk−Jhm)(uhm)x+w(Jhk−Jhm)(uhm)x. (2.28)
Note that ( 2.25)-(2.26) is of the form of the nonhomogeneous system ( 2.22)-(2.23). If we replace ( u,v) in (2.7)
by (p,q) we get the energy Es=Es(p,q) associated with ( 2.25)-(2.26). By following Remark 2.4, we write the
estimate
d

s+C/parenleftBig
/bardblF1/bardblHs+/bardblF2/bardblHs/parenrightBig
Es, (2.29)
where the term /bardblw/bardblYshas been incorporated into the constant. By the molliﬁer estimate ( 2.8) we have
/vextenddouble/vextenddouble(Jhk−Jhm)zx/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
Hs−2≤C|hk−hm| /bardblzx/bardblHs−1≤C|hk−hm| /bardblz/bardblHs.
Then, one has /bardblFi/bardblHs−2≤C|hk−hm|fori= 1,2. Replacing sin (2.29) bys−2>3/2, we get
d
dtE2
s−2≤CE2
s−2+C|hk−hm| Es−2,E2
s−2(0) = 0. (2.30)
Then, Gronwall’s inequality gives Es−2≤C|hk−hm|. Hence uhk,vhkare Cauchy in Xs−2; and thus they
converge in Xs−2. By uniqueness of the limit, this limit must be the weak limit ¯ u,¯v∈Xs. Finally it is quite
straightforward to see that ¯ u,¯vindeed solve the Cauchy problem ( 2.4)-(2.5). So we have established the local
well-posedness of solutions to ( 2.4)-(2.5).
Lemma 2.6 Suppose µsatisﬁes 0< c1≤/hatwideµ(ξ)≤c2for some constants c1andc2. Lets >7/2and

(x,t)∈R×[0,T]for some constant d1. Then there exist unique u,v∈Yssatisfying ( 2.4)-(2.5) onR×[0,T].
3. Local well-posedness for the nonlinear system
Once having proved the well-posedness of the linearized system, th e next stage is to prove the local well-
posedness of the nonlinear system ( 2.2)-(2.3). In the proof of the main theorem, we will make use of the
nonlinear estimates (see [ 1,2]) in the following lemma:
Lemma 3.1 Leth∈C∞(R)withh(0) = 0. Then, for any s≥0andu,v∈L∞∩Hs,
1.h(u)∈Hswith/bardblh(u)/bardblHs≤C1/bardblu/bardblHswhereC1depends on hand/bardblu/bardblL∞.

The main result of this section is:
Theorem 3.2 Suppose µsatisﬁes 0< c1≤/hatwideµ(ξ)≤c2for some constants c1andc2. Lets >7/2and
u0,v0∈Hsbe suﬃciently small. Then there exists some T >0so that the nonlinear system ( 2.2)-(2.3) is
locally well posed with solution u,v∈Ys=C/parenleftbig

∩C1/parenleftbig
[0,T],Hs−1/parenrightbig
.
7ERBAY et al./Turk J Math
Proof The proof is done via Picard’s iterations. We employ the energy estima te in Lemma 2.3takingJh=I
andw=g′(u) in (2.9)-(2.10). Due to ( 2.6) we ask the initial value u(x,0) =u0(x) to satisfy
0< d1≤c1+g′(u0(x))
for allx∈R. Sinceg′(0) = 0,we have 0 < c1≤1+g′(z) for suﬃciently small |z|. By the Sobolev embedding
theorem, there is some γso that 0 < d1≤c1+g′(z(x,t)) whenever /bardblz(t)/bardblHs≤γ.
We assume that /bardblu0/bardblHs+/bardblv0/bardblHs≤γ
2. Consequently w0=g′(u0) satisﬁes ( 2.6). We now consider the
iterates ( un+1,vn+1) solving the following linear system
un+1
t=vn+1
x, un+1(x,0) =u0(x),
vn+1
t=Bun+1
x+wnun+1
x, vn+1(x,0) =v0(x)
with (u0,v0) = (u0,v0) andwn=g′(un). By the energy estimate ( 2.11) of Lemma 2.3, we have
/bardblu1(t)/bardblHs+/bardblv1(t)/bardblHs≤/parenleftbig
/bardblu0/bardblHs+/bardblv0/bardblHs/parenrightbig
eCt≤γ
2eCt≤γ
fort≤T0=log2
CwithC=C/parenleftbig
/bardblg′(u0)/bardblHs/parenrightbig
≤C(γ). For all ( un,vn) a similar estimate holds. So wnsatisﬁes
(2.6) for all xandt≤T0=log2
C. We now estimate the diﬀerences ( pn+1,qn+1) = (un+1−un,vn+1−vn).
They satisfy the following system

4. The vanishing dispersion limit of the nonlocal equation
In this section we will consider a parameterized form of ( 1.1) in which the operator Bis replaced by the family
of convolution operators Bε. We then show that for two diﬀerent types of the vanishing dispers ion limit,
solutions of the Cauchy problem for the parameterized form of ( 1.1) converge to the corresponding solution
of the classical elasticity equation ( 1.3). Before we start working with two diﬀerent forms of the kernel, it is
important to remember that the energy estimate of Lemma 2.3requires s >3/2 while the local well-posedness
result of Theorem 3.2requires s >7/2.
4.1. First type of vanishing dispersion limit
In this case we assume that Bε= (δ+εβ)∗with a small parameter ε, a ﬁxed L1function βand the Dirac
measure δ, in which Bεu=u+ε(β∗u). In other words, we consider the nonlocal equation ( 1.4) and study
convergence of the solutions to the nonlocal equation to the corr esponding solution of ( 1.3) asεapproaches
zero. In terms of the ﬁrst-order nonlinear systems this means th at we are comparing solutions ( uε,vε) of the
Cauchy problem
ut=vx, u (x,0) =u0(x), (4.1)
vt=ε(β∗ux)+ux+(g(u))x, v(x,0) =v0(x) (4.2)
with the solution ( u,v) of the p-system (which corresponds to the case ε= 0) for the same initial data. By
the local existence theorem we know that for u0,v0∈Hssuﬃciently small and for some T >0 both nonlinear
systems are locally well-posed with solutions in Ys. Moreover, with a careful examination of the involved
energies, the existence time can be chosen independent of ε≥0.
Then the diﬀerences ( p,q) = (uε−u,vε−v) satisfy
pt=qx, p (x,0) = 0, (4.3)
qt=ε(β∗uε
x)+px+/parenleftbig
g(uε)−g(u)/parenrightbig
x, q(x,0) = 0. (4.4)
We now rearrange the last term in ( 4.4) as follows
/parenleftbig
g(uε)−g(u)/parenrightbig
x=g′(uε)uε
x−g′(u)ux−g′(uε)ux+g′(uε)ux,
=g′(uε)px+/parenleftbig
g′(uε)−g′(u)/parenrightbig
ux.
Using this result in ( 4.4) we get
pt=qx, p(x,0) = 0, (4.5)
qt=ε(β∗px)+px+g′(uε)px+ε(β∗ux)+/parenleftbig
g′(uε)−g′(u)/parenrightbig
ux, q(x,0) = 0. (4.6)
This system is of the form ( 2.22)-(2.23) withJh=I,Bpx=ε(β∗px) +px,w=g′(uε),F1= 0 and
F2=ε(β∗ux)+/parenleftbig
g′(uε)−g′(u)/parenrightbig
ux. Thus, noting that E2
s(t)≈ /bardblp(t)/bardbl2
Hs+/bardblq(t)/bardbl2
Hs, we get
d
dtE2
s≤C/bardblg′(uε)/bardblYsE2
s+C/bardblF2/bardblHsEs (4.7)
9ERBAY et al./Turk J Math
from (2.24). On the other hand, we have
/bardblF2/bardblHs−1≤ε/bardbl(β∗ux)/bardblHs−1+/bardbl/parenleftbig
g′(uε)−g′(u)/parenrightbig
ux/bardblHs−1 (4.8)

≤C/parenleftbig
ε+/bardblp/bardblHs−1/parenrightbig

. (4.10)
Replacing sin (4.7) bys−1, this in turn yields

s−1≤CE2
s−1+εCEs−1,Es−1(0) = 0,
from which we get Es−1(t)≤ε/parenleftbig

; namely
Theorem 4.1 Lets >7/2andu0,v0∈Hsbe suﬃciently small. Suppose 0< c1≤1 +ε/hatwideβ≤c2for all
suﬃciently small εand for some constants c1,c2. Let(uε,vε)and(u,v)be solutions of the Cauchy problem
(4.1)-(4.2) on[0,T]corresponding to the cases ε >0andε= 0, respectively. Then we have the estimate
/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleuε(t)−u(t)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
Hs−1+/vextenddouble/vextenddoublevε(t)−v(t)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
Hs−1≤ε/parenleftbig
eCt−1/parenrightbig
for allt∈[0,T].
4.2. Second type of vanishing dispersion limit
In this case we assume that Bεu=µε∗uwithµε(x) =1√εµ(x√ε) and a small parameter ε. Hereµis an even
ﬁnite Borel measue with/integraltext
Rdµ= 1. As εtends to zero, µεconverges to the Dirac measure δ. The Fourier
transforms of µεandµsatisfy/hatwiderµε(ξ) =/hatwideµ(√εξ). We also assume the second moment condition/integraltext
Rx2d|µ|<∞,
so that/hatwideµ∈C2,/hatwideµ(0) = 1, /hatwideµ′(0) = 0 and the second derivative /hatwideµ′′is bounded. The Taylor expansion around
ξ= 0 gives
/hatwideµ(ξ) = 1+1
2/hatwideµ′′(c)ξ2(4.11)
for some c∈R. As/hatwideµ′′is bounded due to the moment condition; we have/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/hatwideµ(ξ)−1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤Cξ2withC=
1
2supc∈R/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/hatwideµ′′(c)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. Then from the inequality
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/hatwideµε(ξ)−1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/hatwideµ(√εξ)−1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤Cεξ2, (4.12)
we get the estimate
/bardblµε∗u−u/bardblHs−2≤ε/bardblu/bardblHs.
Notice that Bεconverges to Iasε→0 and we get ( 1.3). Again, we study convergence of the solutions of the
nonlocal equation utt=µε∗uxx+(g(u))xxto the corresponding solution of ( 1.3) asεgoes to zero. In terms
of the ﬁrst-order nonlinear systems this means that we are compa ring solutions ( uε,vε) of the Cauchy problem
ut=vx, u (x,0) =u0(x), (4.13)
vt=µε∗ux+(g(u))x, v(x,0) =v0(x) (4.14)
with the solution ( u,v) of the same Cauchy problem when µεis the Dirac delta function. By the local existence
theorem we know that for u0,v0∈Hssuﬃciently small and for some T >0 both nonlinear systems are locally
10ERBAY et al./Turk J Math
well-posed with solutions in Ys. As in the previous subsection, with a careful examination of the inv olved
energies, the existence time can be chosen independent of ε≥0.
Then the diﬀerences ( p,q) = (uε−u,vε−v) satisfy
pt=qx, p(x,0) = 0,
qt=µε∗px+g′(uε)px+(µε∗ux−ux)+/parenleftbig
g′(uε)−g′(u)/parenrightbig
ux, q(x,0) = 0.
The system is of the form ( 2.22)-(2.23) withJh=I,Bpx=µε∗px,w=g′(uε),F1= 0 and F2=
(µε∗ux−ux)+/parenleftbig
g′(uε)−g′(u)/parenrightbig
ux. Again, ( 2.24) reduces to ( 4.7) but with diﬀerent F2. We have the estimate
/bardblF2/bardblHs−3≤ /bardblµε∗ux−ux/bardblHs−3+/bardbl/parenleftbig
g′(uε)−g′(u)/parenrightbig
ux/bardblHs−3 (4.15)
≤εC/bardblu/bardblHs+C/bardbluε−u/bardblHs−3/bardblu/bardblHs−2 (4.16)
≤C/parenleftbig
ε+/bardblp/bardblHs−3/parenrightbig
≤C/parenleftbig
ε+Es−3/parenrightbig
. (4.17)
With this result and s−3>3/2, (2.24) takes the form
d
dtE2
s−3≤CE2
s−3+εCEs−3,Es−3(0) = 0,
So ﬁnally we get Es−3(t)≤ε/parenleftbig
eCt−1/parenrightbig
; namely
Theorem 4.2 Lets >9/2andu0,v0∈Hsbe suﬃciently small. Suppose/integraltext
Rdµ= 1,/integraltext
Rx2d|µ|<∞
and0< c1≤/hatwideµ≤c2for some constants c1,c2. Let(uε,vε)and(u,v)be solutions of the Cauchy problem
(4.13)-(4.14) on[0,T]corresponding to the cases ε >0andµε=δ, respectively. Then we have the estimate
/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleuε(t)−u(t)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
Hs−3+/vextenddouble/vextenddoublevε(t)−v(t)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
Hs−3≤ε/parenleftbig
eCt−1/parenrightbig
for allt∈[0,T].
As an example of the second type of vanishing dispersion limit, we cons ider the measure µ=1
5(δ−1+3δ+δ1)
with the Dirac measure δand its shifts. Explicitly/integraltext
f dµ=1
5(f(−1) + 3f(0) +f(1)). Then the Fourier
transform of µis

and it satisﬁes the positivity condition. Moreover/integraltext
Rdµ=/hatwideµ(0) = 1. Theorem 4.2says that as ε→0, any
solution of the equation
utt(x,t) =1
