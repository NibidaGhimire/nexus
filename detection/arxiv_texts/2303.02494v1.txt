Abstract
Dynamic systems characterized by second-order nonlinear o rdinary differential equations appear in
many ﬁelds of physics and engineering. To solve these kinds o f problems, time-consuming step-
by-step numerical integration methods and convolution met hods based on V olterra series in the time
domain have been widely used. In contrast, this work develop s an efﬁcient generalized pole-residue
method based on the V olterra series performed in the Laplace domain. The proposed method in-
volves two steps: (1) the V olterra kernels are decoupled in t erms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2)
the partial response related to a single Laguerre polynomia l is obtained analytically in terms of the
pole-residue method. Compared to the traditional pole-res idue method for a linear system, one of
the novelties of the pole-residue method in this paper is how to deal with the higher-order poles
and their corresponding coefﬁcients. Because the proposed method derives an explicit, continuous
response function of time, it is much more efﬁcient than trad itional numerical methods. Unlike the
traditional Laplace domain method, the proposed method is a pplicable to arbitrary irregular excita-
tions. Because the natural response, forced response and cr oss response are naturally obtained in the
solution procedure, meaningful mathematical and physical insights are gained. In numerical stud-
ies, systems with a known equation of motion and an unknown eq uation of motion are investigated.
For each system, regular excitations and complex irregular excitations with different parameters are
studied. Numerical studies validate the good accuracy and h igh efﬁciency of the proposed method
by comparing it with the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method.
Keywords: Nonlinear response, V olterra series, pole, Laguerre polyn omials
1. Introduction
Most real dynamic systems, as encountered in mechanical and civil engineering, are inherently
nonlinear and include geometric nonlinearities, nonlinea r constitutive relations in material or nonlin-
ear resistances, etc. [1]. Nonlinear problems are attracti ng increasing attention from engineers and
scientists. This work focuses on solving nonlinear system v ibration problems, i.e., computing tran-
sient responses of nonlinear oscillators under arbitrary i rregular excitations based on a combination
of a pole-residue operation and V olterra series. Because V o lterra series are single-valued, the scope
of the present study is restricted to nonlinear behaviours w ithout bifurcations [2].

Preprint submitted to Elsevier March 7, 2023To analyse nonlinear vibration problems, researchers have performed extensive studies and de-
veloped various mathematical methods. Popular methods inc lude step-by-step numerical integration
methods in the time domain, such as the Runge–Kutta method. T his kind of method not only requires
a small time-step resolution for obtaining high-precision solutions but also is prone to numerical in-
stability [3, 4]. For a long response with small time steps, t he time domain methods are very costly
in computational time. V olterra series is another widely us ed method, which is the extension of the
Duhamel integral for linear systems [5, 6]. V olterra series can reproduce many nonlinear phenom-
ena, but they are very complex due to higher-dimensional con volution integrals [1]. Since 1980’s,
signiﬁcant progress has been made in the general area of the V olterra series. The reader is referred to
Ref. [1] for a quite thorough literature review on the releva nt topics. After 2017, most papers focus
on V olterra series identiﬁcation. De Paula and Marques [7] p roposed a method for the identiﬁcation
of V olterra kernels, which was based on time-delay neural ne tworks. Son and Kim [8] presented a
method for a direct estimation of the V olterra kernel coefﬁc ients. Dalla Libera et al. [9] introduced
two new kernels for V olterra series identiﬁcation. Peng et a l. [10] used the measured response to
identify the kernel function and performed the nonlinear st ructural damage detection. Only a few
papers concentrated on simplifying the computation of conv olution integrals. Traditional methods
for computing convolution integrals involved in the V olter ra series have been performed in three
distinct domains: time, frequency and Laplace. The time dom ain method based on V olterra series
refers to discrete time convolution methods, which also suf fer computational cost problems [8, 11].
Both the frequency domain method and the Laplace domain meth od based on the V olterra series
consist of three steps: (1) V olterra series are transformed into an algebraic equation in the frequency
domain or Laplace domain; (2) the algebraic equation is solv ed by purely algebraic manipulations;
and (3) the solution in Step (2) is transformed back to the tim e domain. Many researchers have used
the frequency domain method to compute the responses of nonl inear systems. Billings et al. [12]
developed a new method for identifying the generalized freq uency response function (GFRF) of non-
linear systems and then predicted the nonlinear response ba sed on these GFRFs. Carassale et al. [13]
introduced a frequency domain approach for nonlinear bridg e aerodynamics and aeroelasticity. Ho
et al. [14] computed an output frequency domain function of a nonlinear damped dufﬁng system
modelled by a V olterra series under a sinusoidal input. Kim e t al. [15, 16] identiﬁed the higher order
frequency response functions by using the nonlinear autore gressive with exogenous input technique
and the harmonic probing method. This type of frequency doma in method is much more efﬁcient
than the time domain method due to the fast Fourier transform algorithm. However, the frequency
domain method not only is limited by frequency resolutions b ut also suffers from leakage problems
due to the use of discrete Fourier transforms. In addition, t he frequency domain method calculates
only a steady-state response. A natural response generated by initial conditions and a cross response
caused by interactions between a system and an excitation ar e ignored. In contrast, the Laplace
domain method can calculate all response components becaus e initial conditions are considered in
the computational procedure. However, it has been restrict ed to analytical operations for simple
excitations, such as sinusoidal excitations and exponenti al excitations [17].
The proposed method falls into the category of the V olterra s eries method computed in the Laplace
domain. Unlike the traditional Laplace domain method, the p roposed method is applicable to arbi-
trary irregular excitations. Because the proposed method f ollows a similar path as a pole-residue
method for linear systems [18], the proposed method to solve nonlinear system vibration problems
is called the generalized pole-residue method. The main con cept of the pole-residue method de-
veloped by Hu et al. [18] was that the poles and residues of the response could be easily obtained
from those of the input and system transfer function to obtai n the closed-form response solution
2of linear systems. This method included three steps: (1) wri ting the system transfer function into
pole-residue form; (2) writing the excitation into pole-re sidue form by the Prony-SS method; (3)
computing the poles and residues of the response by an algebr aic operation based on those from
system and excitation. Compared to Hu et al. [18], which was r egarded as an efﬁcient tool to com-
pute responses of linear systems, the generalized pole-res idue method in this paper is introduced to
compute responses of nonlinear systems. The proposed metho d involves two steps: (1) the V olterra
kernels are decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response related to a
single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in ter ms of the pole-residue method. Compared
to the traditional pole-residue method for a linear system, one of the novelties of the generalized
pole-residue method is how to deal with the higher-order pol es and their corresponding coefﬁcients.
Similar to the Taylor series, the V olterra series represent ation is an inﬁnite series, and convergence
conditions are needed to assure that the representation is m eaningful. Because the proposed method
is based on the V olterra series, only the system with converg ent V olterra series representation can be
treated by the proposed method.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the nonlinea r response is modelled by a V olterra
series, and V olterra kernel functions are decoupled by Lagu erre polynomials. Then, the pole-residue
method for computing explicit responses is developed in Sec tion 3. Numerical studies and discus-
sions are given in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are dr awn in Section 5.
2. Response calculation based on Volterra series
A nonlinear oscillator, whose governing equation of motion is given by
m¨y(t)+c˙y(t)+ky+z(t,y,˙y) =f(t) (1)
wherez(t,y,˙y)represents an arbitrary nonlinear term; m,c, andkare the mass, damping and
linear stiffness, respectively; y(t),˙y(t)and¨y(t)are the displacement, velocity and acceleration,
respectively; and f(t)is the time-dependent excitation.
If the energy of excitation f(t)is limited, the nonlinear response under zero initial condi tions ( i.e.,
zero displacement and zero velocity) can be represented by t he V olterra series [1, 19–21]:
y(t) =N/summationdisplay

i=1f(t−τi)dτ1...dτn (3)
In Eq. 3,h1(τ)is called the ﬁrst-order V olterra kernel function, which re presents the linear behaviour
of the system; hn(τ1,...,τ n)forn >1are the higher-order V olterra kernel functions, which desc ribe
the nonlinear behaviour of the system. The complete formula tion ofy(t)includes inﬁnite series
where the labour of calculating the nthterm increases quickly with the growth of n. Fortunately, the
response accuracy may be ensured by the ﬁrst several order V o lterra series. This is proved here in
numerical studies.
The commonly known Laguerre polynomials are represented as [8, 22]:
lpi(t) =√

k=0(−1)kpi!
k![(pi−k)!]2(2ait)pi−ke−ait(4)

mials satisfy the orthogonal relationship expressed as:

By using Laguerre polynomials, the V olterra kernel functio nhn(t1,...,t n)in Eq. 3 can be decou-
pled as follows [8, 22]:
hn(t1,...,t n) =R1/summationdisplay
p1=0...Rn/summationdisplay

where the coefﬁcient is computed resorting to the orthogona l relationship in Eq. 5:

The above operation that uses the Laguerre polynomials to de couple V olterra higher order kernel
functions has been well-developed. The reader is referred t o Refs. [6, 22] for details about the
adopted technique. After decoupling V olterra higher order kernel functions in time, one can regroup
Eq. 8 into:
yn(t) =R1/summationdisplay

By denoting

Eq. 9 becomes

i=1xi(t) (11)
The above procedure to compute the nonlinear response by a co mbination of V olterra series and
Laguerre polynomials is schematically shown in Fig. 1. V olt erra kernel functions hn(t1,...,t n)can
be obtained by either an equation of motion or measured input –output signals. To derive a closed-
form solution of the response, we must obtain a closed-form s olution of xi(t)ﬁrst. In the following
presentation, a closed-form solution of the aforementione dxi(t)andyn(t)is derived by using the
pole-residue method.

3. Pole-residue method for calculating xi(t)andyn(t)
Performing the Laplace transform of xi(t)in Eq. 10 yields
˜xi(s) =˜lpi(s)˜f(s) (12)
where
˜lpi(s) =L[lpi(t)] =pi/summationdisplay
k=0bpi(k)
(s+ai)k+1(13)
in which
bpi(k) =(−1)pi−kpi!(2ai)k+0.5
k!(pi−k)!(14)
Eq. 13 includes a single pole and several higher-order poles . Fork= 0,−aiis a single pole, and
bpi(0)is a corresponding coefﬁcient, namely, the residue. For k >0,−aiare higher-order poles,
andbpi(k)are corresponding coefﬁcients.
5For an irregular excitation signal f(t)of a ﬁnite duration of T, it can always be approximated
into a pole-residue form by using the complex exponential si gnal decomposition method—Prony-
SS [23]:
f(t) =Nℓ/summationdisplay
ℓ=1αℓexp(λℓt) 0≤t < T (15)
whereNℓis the number of components; αℓandλℓare constant coefﬁcients, which either are real
numbers or occur in complex conjugate pairs. We deﬁne λℓ=−δℓ+iΩℓ, whereΩℓis the excitation
frequency and δℓis the damping factor of the ℓthcomponent. We denote αℓ=Aℓeiθℓ, whereAℓis the
amplitude and θℓis the sinusoidal initial phase in radians. Taking the Lapla ce transform of Eq. 15
yields
˜f(s) =Nℓ/summationdisplay
ℓ=1αℓ
s−λℓ(16)
Note that the concept of the Prony-SS method is similar to tha t of a principal component method.
A smooth excitation usually requires just several terms to a chieve a good approximation. For high
irregular loadings, including more terms would achieve a be tter approximation.
Substituting Eqs. 13 and 16 into Eq. 12 yields

(22)
6Theoretically speaking, the proposed method for deriving t he closed-form solution of the nonlin-
ear response is applicable to any order of the V olterra serie s. For practical engineering, usually only
the ﬁrst several order responses dominate. By setting up N= 2, Eq. 22 can be simpliﬁed into three
components:
y(t) =ys(t)+yc(t)+yf(t) (23)
where the natural response, which is only related to system p oles, is given by
ys(t) =R1/summationdisplay
p1=0p1/summationdisplay
k=0cp1βp1,k

k=0p2/summationdisplay
m=0cp1p2βp1,kβp2,m
k!m!t(k+m)e−(a1+a2)t(24)
and the cross response, which is related to both system poles and excitation poles, is given by
yc(t) =R1/summationdisplay
p1=0R2/summationdisplay
p2=0p1/summationdisplay
k=0Nℓ/summationdisplay

p2=0p2/summationdisplay
m=0Nℓ/summationdisplay
ℓ=1cp1p2βp2,mγp1,ℓtm
m!e(−a2+λℓ)t(25)
and the forced response, which is related only to excitation poles, is given by
yf(t) =R1/summationdisplay
p1=0Nℓ/summationdisplay
ℓ=1cp1γp1,ℓeλℓt+R1/summationdisplay
p1=0R2/summationdisplay
p2=0Nℓ/summationdisplay
ℓ=1Nℓ/summationdisplay
j=1cp1p2γp1,ℓγp2,je(λℓ+λj)t(26)
The ﬁrst term in Eq. 26 is the ﬁrst-order forced response gove rned by the excitation frequency,
i.e., the imaginary part of the pole λℓ. The second term corresponds to the second-order nonlinear
forced response, which includes the sum frequency and diffe rence frequency responses governed by
λℓ+λj. Eq. 26 straightforwardly offers visible information abou t the possible nonlinear vibrations
by the cooperation of excitation frequencies.
Particularly, consider a sinusoidal excitation f(t) = sinωrt, which can be expressed as f(t) =
γeλt+γ∗eλ∗t, whereγ=−0.5iandλ= iωr. Substituting these values into Eq. 26, the second term
of Eq. 26 is simpliﬁed as
yf2(t) =R1/summationdisplay
p1=0R2/summationdisplay
p2=00.5cp1p2−R1/summationdisplay
p1=0R2/summationdisplay
p2=00.5cp1p2cos2ωrt (27)
where the ﬁrst term is the difference frequency response, an d the second term is the sum frequency
response.
4. Numerical studies
In practical engineering, some systems have an accurate equ ation of motion. Additionally, some
systems have difﬁculty constructing their equations of mot ion because of complex nonlinear dy-
namic behaviours and uncertain system parameters. In this a rticle, a system with a known equation
of motion is called a known system, and a system with an unknow n equation of motion is called an
unknown system for simplicity. In this section, two numeric al studies are presented. The ﬁrst study
veriﬁes the proposed method using a known nonlinear oscilla tor, and the second study demonstrates
the applicability of the proposed method to an unknown syste m. Throughout the numerical studies,
the unit system is the metre–kilogramme–second (MKS) syste m; for conciseness, explicit units for
quantities are omitted.
74.1. A known nonlinear system
This study chooses a nonlinear oscillator written as:
m¨y+c˙y+k1y+k2y2+k3y3=f(t) (28)
where mass m= 1, damping c= 1, linear stiffness k1= 10 , quadratic stiffness k2= 20
and cubic stiffness k3= 20 . It is a case that has been studied in a previously published a rti-
cle [15]. The linear natural frequency of the system ω0=/radicalbig
k1/m= 3.16and the damping ratio
ζ=c/(2mω0) = 15.8%. This kind of oscillator occurs in many engineering problem s, such as a
model of ﬂuid resonance in a narrow gap between large vessels [25]. In the model, k1yrepresents
the linear restoring force of the ﬂuid, and k2y2andk3y3are respectively the quadratic and cubic
nonlinear restoring forces of the ﬂuid.
4.1.1. Volterra kernel functions
Generally, the ﬁrst several order responses dominate the to tal response of a system. Hence, the
order of the V olterra series in Eq. 22 is chosen to be 3, namely ,N= 3. For computing the ﬁrst three
order responses from Eq. 22, the ﬁrst three order V olterra ke rnel functions need to be known. Since
V olterra kernel functions and corresponding frequency res ponse functions are related by a speciﬁc
Fourier transform pair, we can ﬁrst write the ﬁrst three orde rs of frequency response functions di-
rectly from Eq. 28. Then, V olterra kernel functions are obta ined by the inverse Fourier transform.
Based on the harmonic probing algorithm [26, 27], the linear frequency response function (LFRF)
H1(ω), the quadratic frequency response function (QFRF) H2(ω1,ω2)and the cubic frequency re-
sponse function (CFRF) H3(ω1,ω2,ω3)are analytically given by:
H1(ω) =1
−mω2+icω+k1,−∞< ω <∞ (29)
H2(ω1,ω2) =−k2H1(ω1)H1(ω2)H1(ω1+ω2),−∞< ω1,ω2<∞ (30)
and
H3(ω1,ω2,ω3) =−/braceleftbiggk2
3[H1(ω1)H2(ω2,ω3)+H1(ω2)H2(ω1,ω3)+H1(ω3)H2(ω1,ω2)]
+k3H1(ω1)H1(ω2)H1(ω3)}H1(ω1+ω2+ω3),−∞< ω1,ω2,ω3<∞(31)
Figures 2-5 show H1(ω),H2(ω1,ω2)andH3(ω1,ω2,ω3), respectively, which agree well with those
reported in Ref. [15]. As expected, the modulus of H1(ω)in Fig. 2 peaks near the linear natural
frequency ω0, and the phase angle decreases monotonically from 0 to - πwith increasing frequency.
Figure 3 shows the sum frequency QFRF, where the energy conve rges along the line of ω1+ω2≈ω0.
Therefore, when the sum frequency of a two-tone excitation e quals the linear resonant frequency,
the second-order response may reach its maximum. Additiona lly, those pairs of excitations in line
ω1+ω2≈ω0may produce non-negligible vibration magnitudes due to sec ond-order nonlinear
effects. For the difference frequency QFRF in Fig. 3(b), the energy converges along two main lines,
i.e.,ω1≈ω0andω2≈ω0. Figures 4 and 5 show moduli of H3(ω,ω,ω)andH3(ω,ω,−ω), which
are diagonal terms of the sum frequency CFRF and the differen ce frequency CFRF, respectively.
While the modulus of H3(ω,ω,ω)peaks near ω≈ω0/3andω0, that ofH3(ω,ω,−ω)peaks near
ω≈ω0with a small hump around ω≈ω0/2. Values at ω≈ω0/3andω0/2may be magniﬁed by
higher-order stiffness terms in Eq. 28.

By performing the inverse fast Fourier transform to Eqs. 29- 31, the corresponding linear impulse
response function h1(t), quadratic impulse response function h2(t1,t2)and cubic impulse response
functionh3(t1,t2,t3)are obtained. Here, h1(t)andh2(t1,t2)are plotted in Figs. 6 and 7, respec-
tively, and h3(t,t,t)is shown in Fig. 8. In the numerical implementation, Eqs. 29- 31 have been
utilized with the frequency interval ∆ω= 0.1, number of frequency components Nn= 1025 , and
cut-off frequencies 102.4and−102.4. For decoupling V olterra kernel functions by using Laguerr e
polynomials, the damping rate and number of Laguerre polyno mials for each order V olterra kernel
10function need to be determined (see Eqs. 4 and 6). In this exam ple, we set a1=a2=a3= 2 and
R1=R2=R3= 24 because coefﬁcients cp1...pnbecome very small when Rn>24,n= 1,2,3.
According to Eq. 7, the coefﬁcients of the ﬁrst three order V o lterra kernel functions are calculated,
which are shown in Figs. 9 and 10. For convenience, Fig. 10 plo ts onlycp1p2p3forp3= 0. With
the increase of the order of Laguerre polynomials, coefﬁcie nts in Figs. 9 and 10 gradually decrease,
which illustrates how the ﬁrst several orders of Laguerre po lynomials dominate all orders of the
V olterra kernel function. With the known Laguerre polynomi als and corresponding coefﬁcients,
V olterra kernel functions are reconstructed by Eq. 6. For co mparison, reconstructed V olterra ker-
nel functions are also plotted in Figs. 6-8. The reconstruct ed results agree well with the analytical
values, which veriﬁes the accuracy of the decomposition.

From Eq. 28, we consider a sinusoidal excitation
f(t) =Asin(Ωt) (32)
whereAandΩare the amplitude and the frequency, respectively. Five cas es ofAandΩare shown
in Table 1. Excitation frequencies in Cases 1 and 2 are larger than the linear natural frequency
(ω0≈3.16), those in Case 3 are very close to ω0, and those in Cases 4 and 5 are smaller than ω0. All
cases have same amplitudes. The poles of a sinusoidal excita tion areλ1,2=±iΩ, and the residues
areα1,2=∓iA/2. Numerical values of excitation poles and residues for diff erent cases are listed in
Table 1.

Substituting poles and residues of the excitation, as well a s those of the system into Eqs. 20 and
19, response coefﬁcients βpi,kcorresponding to system poles −aiand response coefﬁcients γpi,ℓ
corresponding to excitation poles λℓare calculated, respectively. According to Eq. 22, the ﬁrst three
orders of responses for each case in Table 1 are calculated. F igures 11(a)-15(a) show the comparison
of responses obtained by the proposed method and the fourth- order Runge–Kutta method with ∆t=
10−4. For Cases 1 and 2, the ﬁrst-order responses agree well with t he total responses obtained by the
Runge–Kutta method, and the higher-order responses only sl ightly improve the transient parts. For
Cases 3–5, the sum of the ﬁrst three orders of responses is in g ood agreement with the Runge–Kutta
13solution. When the response nonlinearity increases, highe r-order responses need to be considered.
In other words, the proposed method can accurately compute t he nonlinear responses by choosing a
small number Nof V olterra series terms.
Figures 11(b)-15(b) show the contributions of the three res ponse components for the ﬁve cases. In
each case, the ﬁrst-order response is the most dominant comp onent, and the contributions of second-
and third-order responses are much less than those of the ﬁrs t-order response. Especially for Cases
1 and 2, whose excitation frequencies are far from the linear natural frequency, second- and third-
order responses are close to zero. This may be because the QFR F and CFRF approach zero when
the frequency is larger than 4 rad/s (see Figs. 3–5). Further more, the mean values of the ﬁrst-order
responses are approximately zero, and those of the second-o rder responses are always smaller than
zero, which are the difference frequency components in Eq. 2 7. Moreover, it is clearly observed that
second-order responses for Cases 3–5 exhibit a periodic osc illation with a period near half of that
for the ﬁrst-order response, which is excited by the sum freq uency component of the excitation (see
second part of Eq. 27). Compared with steady-state solution s of ﬁrst- and second-order responses,
those of third-order responses in Cases 3–5 are no longer sin gle regular motions. By performing the
FFT, frequency spectra of these three third-order response s are shown in Fig. 16. We ﬁnd that these
three third-order responses are all dominated by their own f undamental harmonic component and
the third harmonic (triple frequency) component.
Figure 17 shows the computational time to calculate the resp onse of the oscillator for Case 1
by the proposed method, the fourth-order Runge–Kutta metho d and the convolution method. The
proposed method, which has an explicit solution, is much mor e efﬁcient in computational time than
the latter two methods, which need small time steps to obtain high-precision solutions. In particular,
the efﬁciency of the proposed method increases with the leng th of the response time.

each case, the amplitudes of all components are the same, and phase angles θnuniformly distributed
between 0 and 2πare randomly generated. To decompose the excitation into a p ole-residue form,
the Prony-SS method is used, whose concept is similar to that of a principal component method. The
readers are referred to Ref. [23] for details. The chosen ran k of each case is also shown in Table
2. Figure 18 shows the comparison of original excitations an d reconstructed results of these three
cases, which all have excellent agreement.

Referring to Eq. 22 with N= 3, nonlinear responses of the system to irregular excitation s in Table
2 are calculated, which are shown in Figs. 19(a)-21(a), resp ectively. Additionally, Figs. 19(a)-21(a)
show the results computed by the fourth-order Runge–Kutta m ethod. In all cases, the sums of the
ﬁrst three orders of responses agree well with those obtaine d by the Runge–Kutta method.
The contributions of the ﬁrst three orders of responses for e ach case are plotted in Figs. 19(b)-
21(b). Similarly, the system vibration is dominated by the ﬁ rst-order response. However, the contri-
butions of second- and third-order responses signiﬁcantly grow with increasing excitation magnitude
17and frequency number. Furthermore, when the magnitude of th e nonlinear response becomes large,
sharp troughs are present. This phenomenon may be induced by the nonlinear stiffness. While the
ﬁrst-order response fails to capture these troughs, the hig her-order responses successfully capture
these troughs.
Figure 22 plots the computational time to calculate the resp onse of the oscillator for the irregular
loading in Case 1 by the proposed method and the fourth–ﬁfth o rder Runge–Kutta method, respec-
tively. While the fourth–ﬁfth order Runge–Kutta method is m ore efﬁcient under a small response
length, the proposed method becomes much more efﬁcient when the response length is larger than
about 130 s. In addition, the proposed method obtains the exp licit response solution, so one can di-
rectly obtain the response value at a speciﬁc time tpinstead of integrating from 0totpfor traditional
numerical methods.

4.2. An unknown nonlinear system
To check the applicability of the proposed method to an unkno wn nonlinear system, a known input
excitation and its corresponding response are used to ident ify its V olterra kernel functions. When
the V olterra kernel functions are known, we can follow the pr ocedure in Section 4.1 to predict
system responses. In this study, the input excitation is whi te noise with a constant power spectrum
S0= 0.001, and the corresponding response is obtained by solving Eq. 2 8 by the fourth-order
Runge–Kutta method, which is shown in Fig. 23. From Section 4 .1, we determine that the sum
of the ﬁrst two orders of responses agrees well with the total response. In this study, the order
of V olterra series Nis chosen to be 2, damping rates of Laguerre polynomials are a1=a2= 2,
and numbers of Laguerre polynomials are R1=R2= 24 . To estimate the ﬁrst two orders of
V olterra kernel functions, a matrix equation is constructe d using excitation data and response data.
By using the least square method [8] to solve this matrix equa tion, coefﬁcients cp1andcp1p2in
19Eq. 8 are identiﬁed. Figure 24 plots cp1andcp1p2, respectively, which have good agreement with the
exact results in Fig. 9. Then, the ﬁrst two order V olterra ker nel functions are constructed by Eq. 6.
Compared with the exact results in Figs. 6 and 7, the identiﬁe d V olterra kernel functions in Fig. 25
completely agree well with the exact solutions. Note that th e white noise excitation, which can excite
more frequency components of the response, is chosen to obta in good V olterra kernel functions.

predicted responses, along with results obtained by the fou rth-order Runge–Kutta method, are shown
in Fig. 26. In both cases, the proposed method accurately pre dicts system responses. As presented in
Eq. 23, a nonlinear response is the sum of three terms: natura l response ys(t), forced response yf(t)
and cross response yc(t). These individual terms, as well as their sum to two excitati ons, are shown
in Figs. 27 and 28, respectively. As shown in Figs. 27 and 28, b oth ﬁrst- and second-order responses
include the natural response ys(t)and the forced response yf(t), but the cross response yc(t)only
exists in second-order responses. When tbecomes larger, both ys(t)andyc(t)diminish due to the
presence of system damping, and the total response is entire ly governed by yf(t). Moreover, we
notice some features at t= 0 for these components, including ys(0) =−yf(0)for the ﬁrst-order
response and ys(0)+yf(0) =−yc(0)for the second-order response, which are due to imposed zero
initial conditions.

5. Conclusions
Considering arbitrary irregular excitations, an efﬁcient generalized pole-residue method to com-
pute the nonlinear dynamic response modelled by the V olterr a series was developed. A core of the
proposed method was obtaining poles and corresponding coef ﬁcients of V olterra kernel functions,
then those of each order response modelled by each order V olt erra series. Once the poles and corre-
sponding coefﬁcients of V olterra kernel functions and exci tations were both available, the remaining
derivation could follow a similar pole-residue method that had been developed for ordinary linear
oscillators. To obtain the poles and corresponding coefﬁci ents of V olterra kernel functions, two steps
were included: (1) using Laguerre polynomials to decouple h igher-order V olterra kernel functions
with respect to time and (2) obtaining poles and correspondi ng coefﬁcients of Laguerre polynomials
in the Laplace domain. Because the proposed method gave an ex plicit, continuous response function
of time, it was much more efﬁcient than traditional numerica l methods. Moreover, many meaningful
physical and mathematical insights were gained because not only each order response but also the
natural response, the forced response and the cross respons e of each order were obtained in the so-
lution procedure. To demonstrate that the proposed method w as not only suitable for a system with
a known equation of motion but also applicable to a system wit h an unknown equation of motion,
22two numerical studies were conducted. For each study, regul ar excitations and complex irregular
excitations with different parameters were investigated. The efﬁciency of the proposed method was
veriﬁed by the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. This paper only computes the response under zero
initial conditions. The response under non-zero initial co nditions will be investigated in our future
work.
