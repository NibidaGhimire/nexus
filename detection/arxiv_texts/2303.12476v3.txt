Abstract. Let Ω := {0,1}Zbe the Cantor space, and let τ: Ω→Ω be the Bernoulli shift.
For the ﬂow on the crossed product C(Ω)⋊τZdetermined by a potential that depends on only
one coordinate, we show that for every β/ne}ationslash= 0, there is an extremal β-KMS state on C(Ω)⋊τZ
of typeII∞. Also, when the potential takes values that are rationally d ependent, we determine
the values of λ∈(0,1) for which there is a an extremal β-KMS state of type IIIλ.

1.Introduction
The analysis of KMS states on various C∗-algebras has been in vogue for a long time and
has attracted quite a lot of attention over the last two decad es. We can consider [9], [8],
[16], [14], [24], [25], [7], [6], [13] as a small sample of pap ers that deal with this subject. One
of the earliest important example is the case of the Cuntz-al gebraOnwhich is the universal
C∗-algebra generated by isometries {s1,s2,···,sn}that satisfy the relation
n/summationdisplay
i=1sis∗
i= 1.
Thanks to the universal property of On, given positive real numbers λ1,λ2,···,λn, there exists
a1-parameter group ofautomorphisms σ:={σt}t∈RonOnsuchthat forevery k∈ {1,2,···,n}
andt∈R,σt(sk) =eitλksk. Evans proved in [9] that, with this action of R,Onhas a unique
KMS state attained at the inverse temperature β, whereβis the unique solution for the
equationn/summationdisplay
i=1e−βλi= 1. Izumi ([12]) showed that in the GNS representation, Ongenerates a
type III factor.
From the groupoid perspective, due to Renault, Onis isomorphic to the C∗-algebra of the
Deaconu-Renault groupoidassociated totheone-sidedshif tontheCantorspace {0,1,2,···,n−
1}N. In [13], Kumjian and Renault showed that Evans’ result can b e deduced from this reali-
sation, where the action of Ris given by a cocycle which in turn is determined by a potentia l
that depends only on the ﬁrst coordinate. It is quite natural to ask what phenomena arise if
we replace the one-sided shift by the two-sided shift.
We consider only the two-sided shift on two symbols. The situ ation is vastly diﬀerent. As
opposed to O2, theC∗-algebraC({0,1}Z)⋊ Zis not simple. This could be one reason why
12 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
the structure of KMS states for the two-sided shift does not s eem to be investigated in greater
detail in the literature. Neverthless, the author believes that there are a few questions that are
of interest, and it is worth the eﬀort to resolve them. We pose o ne such question and resolve
it partially.
Let Ω := {0,1}Z, and letτbe the Bernoulli shift on Ω, i.e τ(x)k=xk−1. Letχ: Ω→Rbe a
continuous function that dependson only onecoordinate. Th euniversal property of the crossed
productC(Ω)⋊τZgrants us a 1-parameter group of automorphisms σ:={σt}t∈RonC(Ω)⋊Z
such that for every t∈R,σt(f) =fforf∈C(Ω), andσt(u) =ueitχ. Here,uis the canonical
unitary of the crossed product C(Ω)⋊ Z. (This type of ﬂow for a more general dynamical
system (X,T), whereXis a compact space and Tis a homeomorphism, was considered by
Christensen and Thomsen in [7]).
Suppose that χtakes values aandb. The analysis of KMS states is interesting only when a,
bare non-zero, and when they are of opposite signs. For a justi ﬁcation, the reader can consult
Theorem 6.2 of [7], and the analysis carried out at Page 18 in [ 3]. Thus, we can normalise, and
assume that χ: Ω→Ris given by
χ(x) :=

1 ifx−1= 0,
−θifx−1= 1
for someθ>0. The structure of KMS states for the ﬂow σ, determined by the potential χ, is
vastly diﬀerent from the O2case. We have the following contrasting features.
(1) The set of possible inverse temperatures is the whole rea l lineR.
(2) For every β∈Rand for every t∈ {I,II,III }, there is a continuum of extremal β-KMS
states of type t.
In the case when θis rational, it is not diﬃcult to construct extremal KMS stat es of typeI,II
andIII. In the case when θis irrational, it is still not hard to construct extremal KMS states
of typeIand typeII. However, up to the author’s knowledge, the construction of a typeIII
example (in fact, type III1) requires the non-trivial work of Nakada ([17], [18]). The t ypeII
examples constructed in [3] are of type II1. For more details, we refer the reader to [3] (see
also Remark 2.5).
Given that all the three factorial KMS states are possible, a more reﬁned question would be
to ask whether every possible Krieger type occurs or not. In p articular, the author believes
that it is worth asking the following questions. Let βbe a non-zero real number.
(1) Does there exist an extremal β-KMS state of type II∞?
(2) Determine the values of λ∈(0,1) for which there is an extremal β-KMS state for σof
typeIIIλ.
(3) Does there exist an extremal β-KMS state of type III0?ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT 3
As mentioned earlier, it follows from the work of Nakada ([17 ], [18]) that type III1occurs when
θis irrational. In this paper, we show the existence of a type II∞example. Also, when θis
rational, we determine the values of λ∈(0,1) for which there is a β-KMS state of type IIIλ.
Elementary considerations establish a bijective correspo ndencem→ωmbetween the set of
non-atomic, ergodic probability measures mon Ω that are e−βχ-conformal, i.e.
d(m◦τ)
dm=e−βχ
and the set of extremal β-KMS states on C(Ω)⋊τZthat are not of type I. Moreover, for every
t∈ {II1,II∞,IIIλ:λ∈[0,1]},mis of typetif and only if ωmis of typet. Our main theorem
is stated below.
Theorem 1.1. For every non-zero β∈R, there exists an ergodic probability measure monΩ
such thatmise−βχ-conformal, and mis of typeII∞.
The proof of the above theorem is existential and not constru ctive. Our proof is also oper-
ator algebraic. Our ﬁrst reduction, which we undertake in Se ction 2, is based on the bijection
established in [3] that asserts that the set of e−βχ-conformal measures on Ω is in bijective cor-
respondence with the set of e−βc-conformal, Radon measures on the unit space of the Deaconu-
Renault groupoid Xu⋊N2that encodes two parameter discrete semigroups of isometri es with
commuting rangeprojections. Here, thecocycle c:Xu⋊N2→Risgiven bythehomomorphism
c:Z2→Rdeﬁned byc(m,n) =m+nθ.
Secondly, we show that constructing e−βc-conformal measures on Xuis equivalent to con-
structing representations ( equivalently, constructing s emigroups of isometries, indexed by N2,
with commuting range projections) of C∗(Xu⋊N2) for which the eigenspace of N2correspond-
ing to the character e−βc
2is non-trivial. This translation is inspired by the techniq ues of [11].
We undertake this translation in Section 3, where we prove th e results in a more general set-
ting of a closed subsemigroup of a locally compact, abelian g roup. We show that proving Thm.
1.1 amounts to constructing a two parameter semigroup of iso metries with commuting range
projections satisfying certain hypotheses. In Section 4, b y appealing to certain results available
in the literature concerning ergodic theory, we produce suc h a semigroup of isometries which
proves Thm. 1.1.
As far as type IIIexamples are concerned, we prove the following. Suppose θis rational,
and suppose θ=p
qwith gcd(p,q) = 1. Let βbe a non-zero real number. Suppose mis an
e−βχ-conformal measure that is of type IIIλ. Sinceχtakes values in1
qZ, it follows that the
ratio set
r(τ)∩(0,∞)⊂ {e−βn
q:n∈Z}
which is a closed subgroup of (0 ,∞). Hence,λis necessarily of the form e−|β|n
qfor somen≥1.
The next theorem ensures that every such λis realised.4 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
Theorem 1.2. Supposeθ:=p
qis rational, and let βbe a non-zero real number. Then, for
everyλ∈ {e−|β|n
q:n∈ {1,2,···}}, there exists an ergodic, probability measure monΩsuch
thatmise−βχ-conformal, and mis of typeIIIλ.
The author’s interest to analyse the structure of KMS states onC(Ω)⋊τZstems from the
closerelationship, establishedin[3], thatexistsbetwee ntheKMSstates on C∗
c(N2)(whichisthe
universalC∗-algebra generated by a semigroup of isometries {v(m,n)}(m,n)∈N2with commuting
range projections) for the time evolution determined by the homomorphism c:Z2→Rand
the KMS states on C(Ω)⋊Z. Roughly, at positive inverse temperature, every KMS state on
C∗
c(N2) is an ’ampliﬁed version’ of a unique KMS state on C(Ω)⋊Z. Conversely, every KMS
state onC(Ω)⋊ Zis a ‘corner’ of a unique KMS state on C∗
c(N2). From this, it is apparent
that typeIIKMS states on C∗
c(N2) are always of type II∞. But it is not at all clear why type
II∞occurs forC(Ω)⋊Z. In fact, the examples constructed in [3] are of type II1. Thus, it is
of intrinsic interest to investigate whether there are type II∞KMS states on C(Ω)⋊Z.
Convention: For us, the set of natural numbers Ncontains 0. All the Hilbert spaces con-
sidered in this paper are assumed to be separable, and the inn er product is linear in the ﬁrst
variable.
2.A reduction
Let Ω := {0,1}Zbe the Cantor space, and let τ: Ω→Ω be the Bernoulli shift deﬁned by
τ(x)k=xk−1. Supposeθ>0. Letχ: Ω→Rbe the continuous map deﬁned by
χ(x) :=

1 ifx−1= 0,
−θifx−1= 1.
Recall that the potential χdeﬁnes a ﬂow σ:={σt}t∈RonC(Ω)⋊τZ, where the automorphism
σtis given by
σt(f) =fandσt(u) =ueitχ
forf∈C(Ω). Here,ustands for the canonical unitary of the crossed product C(Ω)⋊τZ.
Fix a real number β. Letωbe aβ-KMS state on C(Ω)⋊τZforσ. Letm:=mωbe the
probability measure on Ω that corresponds to the state ω|C(Ω). Then,mis ane−βχ-conformal
measure on Ω, i.e.
m(τ(B)) =/integraldisplay
Be−βχdm
for every Borel set B⊂Ω. Conversely, suppose mis ane−βχ-conformal probability measure
on Ω. Then, there exists a unique β-KMS state ω=ωmonC(Ω)⋊τZsuch that
ω(fuk) =δk,0/integraldisplay
fdm.
Also,mωm=m.ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT 5
For aβ-KMS state ωonC(Ω)×τZ, we denote the associated GNS representation by πω.
Let us make the following observations regarding the set of e xtremalβ-KMS states.
(1) Suppose mis a non-atomic probability measure on Ω. Since Ω has only cou ntably many
periodic points, it follows that the action of Zon (Ω,m) viaτis essentially free.
(2) Suppose mis ane−βχ-conformal probability measure that is non-atomic and ergo dic.
It follows from Thm. 4.13 of [7] that ωmis an extremal β-KMS state of type twhere
t∈ {II,III}.
(3) Suppose ωis an extremal β-KMS state. Let mbe the associated e−βχ-conformal mea-
sure. Then, it follows from Lemma 3.7 of [7] that mis ergodic.
(a) Suppose mis atomic and concentrated on an orbit of a non-periodic poin t. Then,
by Corollary 1.4 of [20], it follows that ω=ωm. In this case, it follows from Thm.
4.13 of [7] that ωis of typeI∞.
(b) Suppose mis atomic and concentrated on an orbit of a periodic point of p eriodp.
Then, by Corollary 1.4 of [20], it follows that there exists z∈Tsuch that
ω(fuk) :=

0 if k /∈pZ
zk/integraldisplay
Ωf(x)dm(x) ifk∈pZ.
In this case, it is not diﬃcult to prove as in Prop. 3.4 of [3] th at the von Neumann
algebraπω(C(Ω)⋊τZ)′′=L∞(Ω,m)⋊Z/pZ∼=Mp(C). In this case, ωis of type
Ip.
(c) Suppose mis non-atomic. Since Ω has only countably many periodic poin ts and
mis non-atomic, it follows from Thm. 1.3 of [20] that ω=ωm. In this case, it
follows from Thm. 4.13 of [7] that ωis of typetwheret∈ {II,III}.
Thus, the association
m→ωm
sets up a bijective correspondence between the set of non-at omic, ergodic, e−βχ-conformal
probability measures on Ω and the set of extremal β-KMS states on C(Ω)⋊τZthat are not
of typeI. Thanks to Thm. 4.13 of [7], for an ergodic, e−βχ-conformal probability measure m
on Ω andt∈ {II1,II∞,IIIλ},mis of typetif and only if ωmis of typet. Thus, exhibiting
an extremal β-KMS state of type II∞is equivalent to exhibiting an ergodic, e−βχ-conformal
probability measure mon Ω such that mis of typeII∞.
For a real number β, letMβ(Ω) denote the set of e−βχ-conformal probability measures on
Ω, and let
Me,β(Ω) :={m∈ Mβ(Ω) :mis ergodic }.
Next, we establish a bijection between Mβ(Ω) and M−β(Ω) for every β. Letκ: Ω→Ω be
the homeomorphism deﬁned by
κ(x)k=x−k−1.6 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
Note thatκis of order two, and τ◦κ=κ◦τ−1.
Proposition 2.1. Letβ∈Rbe given. If m∈ Mβ(Ω), thenm◦κ∈ M−β(Ω). Moreover, the
map
Mβ(Ω)∋m→m◦κ∈ M−β(Ω)
is a bijection. Also, the map
Mβ(Ω)∋m→m◦κ∈ M−β(Ω)
preserves ergodicity and the Krieger type.
Proof.Using the fact that τ◦κ=κ◦τ−1, it is routine to check that for a probability measure
mon Ω,m∈ Mβ(Ω) if and only if m◦κ∈ M−β(Ω). Again, for m∈ Mβ(Ω), using the fact
thatτ◦κ=κ◦τ−1, it can be veriﬁed that mis ergodic if and only if m◦κis ergodic.
Letm∈ Me,β(Ω) be given. Clearly, mis atomic if and only if m◦κis atomic. Suppose that
mis non-atomic. Idenﬁty L∞(Ω,m◦κ) withL∞(Ω,m) via the map
L∞(Ω,m◦κ)∋f→f◦κ∈L∞(Ω,m).
With the above identiﬁcation, and thanks to the equality κ◦τ=τ−1◦κ, we have
L∞(Ω,m◦κ)⋊τZ∼=L∞(Ω,m)⋊τ−1Z∼=L∞(Ω,m)⋊τZ.
Therefore,mandm◦κhave the same Krieger type. This completes the proof. ✷
The ﬁrst key step is to convert the problem of constructing co nformal measures on Ω into a
problem of constructing conformal measures on ‘the univers al dynamical system’ that encodes
discrete two parameter semigroups of isometries with commu ting range projections. First, we
make a few deﬁnitions in a more general context.
LetGbe a locally compact, second countable, Hausdorﬀ abelian gr oup. A second countable,
locally compact, Hausdorﬀ space which has a continuous G-action will be called a G-space. Let
Ybe aG-space, and suppose µis a quasi-invariant, ergodic, non-zero, Radon measure on Y.
We say that
(1)µis of typeIifµis supported on an orbit.
(2)µis of typeII1ifµis not of type I, and if the measure class [ µ] has a a non-zero
G-invariant, Radon measure1.
(3)µis of typeII∞ifµis not of type I, and if the measure class [ µ] has a non-zero σ-ﬁnite,
G-invariant measure but has no non-zero G-invariant, Radon measure.
(4)µis of typeIIIif the measure class [ µ] has no non-zero σ-ﬁnite,G-invariant measure.
Ifµis of typeIIIandλ∈[0,1], we say that µis of typeIIIλifL∞(Yu)⋊Gis a factor of type
IIIλ.
1We warn the reader that, type II1, in this sense, does not mean that the associated crossed pro duct

Supposec:G→Ris a continuous homomorphism, and suppose Yis aG-space. A non-zero,
Radon measure µis said to be e−βc-conformal if µ(E+s) =e−βc(s)µ(E) for every s∈Gand
for every Borel subset E⊂Y.
LetGbe a countable, discrete abelian group, and let P⊂Gbe a subsemigroup containing
0 such that P−P=G. Deﬁne
Yu:={A⊂G:−P+A⊂A,A/\e}atio\slash=∅},
Xu:={A∈Yu: 0∈A}.
We identify Yuwith a subset of {0,1}Gin the usual way, and we endow Yuwith the subspace
topology inherited from the product topology on {0,1}G. Note that Yuis a locally compact,
Hausdorﬀ space, and Xuis a compact subset of Yu. The map
Yu×G∋(A,s)→A+s∈Yu
deﬁnes an action of GonYu, andPleavesXuinvariant, i.e. Xu+P⊂Xu.
Remark 2.2. It was demonstrated in [22]that the dynamical system (Yu,G)encodes all
semigroups of isometries, indexed by P, that has commuting range projections. In particu-
lar,C∗(Xu⋊P), whereXu⋊Pis the Deaconu-Renault groupoid, is the universal C∗-algebra
generated by isometries {va:a∈P}such that
(1)fora,b∈P,va+b=vavb, and
(2)the family {vav∗
a:a∈P}is a commuting family of projections.
Moreover,C∗(Xu⋊P)is a full corner in C0(Yu)⋊G. For more details, the reader is referred
to[22]and Section 2 of [3].
SetYu:=Yu\{G}, and letXu:=Xu∩Yu. In [3], when G=Z2andP=N2, a nice
parametrisation of Yuwas obtained which we explain next. For the remainder of this section,
assumeG=Z2andP=N2. Sete1:= (1,0),e2:= (0,1),v1:=e1, andv2:=e1+e2. Deﬁne a
Z2-action on Ω ×Zby setting
(x,t)+v1: = (τ(x),x−1+t),
(x,t)+v2: = (x,t+1).
For (x,t)∈Ω×Z, leta(x,t) be the bi-inﬁnite sequence deﬁned by
(2.1) a(x,t)m:=

t−(x0+x1+···+xm−1) ifm>0,
t ifm= 0,
t+(x−1+x−2+···+xm) ifm<0.
For (x,t)∈Ω×Z, set
A(x,t) :={mv1+nv2:n≤a(x,t)m}.
Then,A(x,t)∈Yufor every (x,t)∈Ω×Z. The following proposition is Prop. 4.1 of [3].8 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
Proposition 2.3 ([3]).The map
Ω×Z∋(x,t)→A(x,t)∈Yu
is aZ2-equivariant homeomorphism.
We identify Yuwith Ω×Zvia the map given by Prop. 2.3, and by abusing notation, we wri te
Yu= Ω×Z. Then,Xu= Ω×N. Letc:Z2→Rbe the homomorphism such that c(e1) = 1 and
c(e2) =θ. Letβ∈R. Denote the set of e−βχ-conformal probability measures on Ω by Mβ(Ω),
and denote the set of e−βc-conformal, non-zero, Radon measures on YubyMβ(Yu). Set
Me,β(Ω) : ={m∈ Mβ(Ω) :mis ergodic },
Me,β(Yu) : ={µ∈ Mβ(Yu) :µis ergodic },
Mβ,v2(Yu) : ={µ∈ Mβ(Yu) :µ(Xu\(Xu+v2)) = 1},
Me,β,v2(Yu) : =Me,β(Yu)∩Mβ,v2(Yu).
For a probability measure mon Ω, deﬁne a Radon measure monYu= Ω×Zby setting
(2.2) m(E×{n}) =e−nβ(1+θ)m(E)
whereE⊂Ω is a Borel subset.
It is routine to prove the following proposition as in Prop. 4 .2 of [3]. Hence, we omit the
proof.
Proposition 2.4. The map
Mβ(Ω)∋m→m∈ Mβ,v2(Yu)
is a bijection. Moreover, for m∈ Mβ(Ω),mis ergodic if and only if mis ergodic. Suppose
m∈ Me,β(Ω). Then, for t∈ {I,II1,II∞,III},mis of typetif and only if mis of typet.
Remark 2.5. Letµ∈ Mβ(Yu). It is clear from the condition
µ(Ω+{n+1}) =µ((Ω×{n})+v2)) =e−β(1+θ)µ(Ω×{n})
thatµ(Ω× {0})/\e}atio\slash= 0. Thus, there exists a unique positive real number rand a unique m∈
Mβ(Ω)such thatµ=rm.
Forβ >0, it was proved in [3]that there is a continuum of e−βc-conformal, ergodic, non-
zero, Radon measures on Yuof typetfor eacht∈ {I,II,III }. Combining Prop. 2.4 and Prop.
2.1, we see that for every non-zero β, there are uncountably many ergodic, e−βχ-conformal
probability measures on Ωof typetfor eacht∈ {I,II,III }.
Lemma 2.6. Letm∈ Mβ(Ω)be such that mis ergodic and is of type III. Letmbe the
Radon measure on Yudeﬁned by Eq. 2.2. For λ∈[0,1],mis of typeIIIλif and only if mis
of typeIIIλ.ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT 9
Proof.Note thatmonYu= Ω×Zis absolutely continuous w.r.t. dmdn, wherednis the
counting measure on Z. The crossed product L∞(Yu)⋊Z2can be written as an iterated crossed
product (L∞(Yu)⋊Zv2)⋊Zv1. But
L∞(Yu)∼=L∞(Ω,m)⊗ℓ∞(Z).
Note that the v2-action is on the second factor, and it acts by translation by 1 onZ. Therefore,
L∞(Yu)⋊Zv2∼=L∞(Ω,m)⊗B(ℓ2(Z)).
Letτ:L∞(Ω,m)→L∞(Ω,m) be the map deﬁned by τ(f)(x) =f(τ−1x). Denote the
bilateral shift on ℓ2(Z) byU, i.e.Uen=en+1, where{en:n∈Z}is the standard orthonormal
basis forℓ2(Z). Deﬁnep∈L∞(Ω,m) byp:= 1{x0=0}.
OnceL∞(Yu)⋊Zv2is identiﬁed with L∞(Ω,m)⊗B(ℓ2(Z)), by a routine direct computation,
we see that the v1-action onL∞(Ω.m)⊗B(ℓ2(Z)) coincides with the automorphism Ad(p⊗
1 + (1−p)⊗U)◦(τ⊗1). Thus, the automorphism corresponding to the v1-action is outer
conjugate to τ⊗1. Hence,
L∞(Yu,m)⋊Z2∼=(L∞(Ω,m)⋊Z)⊗B(ℓ2(Z)).
The result follows. ✷
We have now proved that proving Thm. 1.1 is equivalent to exhi biting an ergodic, non-zero,
Radon measure µonYusuch thatµise−βc-conformal, and µis of typeII∞. How to construct
ergodic,e−βc-conformal, Radon measures on Yu? We take inspiration from the results of [11].
Let us recall the main result of [11]. Suppose Γ is a discrete g roup that acts on a compact
spaceXby homeomorphisms. Then, the set of Γ-invariant, ergodic pr obability measures on
Xis in bijective correspondence with the collection (up to un itary equivalence) of irreducible
representations of the crossed product C(X)⋊Γ for which Γ has an invariant unit vector. We
establish an analogous result here. We show that Me,β,v2(Yu) is in bijective correspondence
with the set of irreducible representations of C∗(Xu⋊ N2) for which the eigenspace of N2
corresponding to the character e−βc
2is non-trivial. In the next section, we prove this bijection
for a general closed, subsemigroup of a locally compact abel ian group.
Remark 2.7. The author’s reason for proving the results in the topologica l setting, and not
just in the discrete setting, is because the results develop ed in the next section are needed for
future applications to E0-semigroups. To avoid duplication, in the next section, the results are
developed in the setting of subsemigroups of locally compac t abelian groups.

For the existence and the uniqueness (up to a unitary equival ence) of the minimal unitary
dilation of an isometric representation, we refer the reade r to [15].

Remark 3.4. LetV:={Va}a∈Pbe a pure, strongly continuous semigroup of isometries on a
Hilbert space H. Fora∈P, letEa:=VaV∗

aξb=ξa.
Conversely, given a coherent section ξ:P→/coproductdisplay

a), there exists a unique φ∈ LV
such that, given a∈P,φ(ξ) =/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tξ|ξa/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htfor everyξ∈Ker(V∗
a). This way, we can identify LV
with the set of coherent sections ξ:P→/coproductdisplay
a∈PKer(V∗
a). We freely use this identiﬁcation.
The space LVcan be given a Fr´ echet space structure, and the space LVappears naturally in
the analysis of decomposable product systems ( [5],[19]) in the theory of E0-semigroups.
LetV:={Va}a∈Pbe an isometric representation of Pon a Hilbert space H. Fora∈P, set
Ea:=VaV∗
a. We say that Vhas commuting range projections if {Ea:a∈P}is a commuting
family of projections. We say that Visirreducible if{Va,V∗

Next, we recall from [22] the relevant results that we need fo r this paper. Fix an order unit
a0∈Int(P) once and for all for the rest of this section. Let C(G) be the set of closed subsets
ofGendowed with the Fell topology. Deﬁne the following subsets ofC(G).
Yu: ={A∈ C(G) :−P+A⊂A,A/\e}atio\slash=∅},
Xu: ={A∈Yu:−P⊂A}={A∈Yu: 0∈A},
Yu: ={A∈Yu:A/\e}atio\slash=G},
Xu: =Yu∩Xu,

X(0)
u: ={A∈Yu:A∩Int(P)/\e}atio\slash=∅}.
Then,Yuis a locally compact, second countable, Hausdorﬀ space whic h is also a G-space,
where the action of GonYuis given by
Yu×G∋(A,s)→A+s∈Yu.
Moreover,Xuis a compact subset of Yu, andXu+P⊂Xu. Observe that X(0)

subset ofYucontained in Xu, andX(0)
u+P⊂X(0)
u. Also,Yuis an open subset of Yu, and
X(0)
uis an open subset of Yuthat is contained in Xu.
Remark 3.5. Let us a record a few facts that we keep appealing to.12 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
(1)The sequence (Xu−na0)nincreases to Yu. For a proof of this, we refer the reader to
Eq. 2.1 of [23](Pages 1515-1516). Also, (Xu−na0)nրYu.
(2)The sequence (Xu+na0)n≥1decreases to {G}. It is clear that (Xu+na0)nis decreasing,
and{G} ⊂/intersectiontext
n≥1(Xu+na0). SupposeA∈/intersectiontext
n≥1(Xu+na0). Then,A−na0∈Xufor
everyn≥1, i.e.na0∈Afor everyn≥1. Since−P+A⊂A,−P+na0⊂A. Since
a0is an order unit, G=/uniontext
n≥1(−P+na0)⊂A. Consequently, A=G. This proves
that/intersectiontext
n≥1(Xu+na0) ={G}. Also, the sequence (Xu+na0)n≥1decreases to ∅.
(3)Notice that for a∈Int(P),Xu+a⊂X(0)
u. Consequently, for every n≥1,Xu+(n+
1)a0⊂X(0)
u+na0, andXu−na0⊂X(0)
u−(n+ 1)a0for everyn≥1. Therefore, by
(1), and(2),(X(0)
u+na0)nց ∅, and(X(0)
u−na0)nրYu.
(4)The collection {Xu+s:s∈G}generates the Borel σ-algebra of Yu, and the collection
{(Xu+s)∩Xu:s∈G}generates the Borel σ-algebra of Xu. Also, the collection
{Xu+s:s∈G}generates the Borel σ-algebra ofYu, and the collection {(Xu+s)∩Xu:
s∈G}generates the Borel σ-algebra of Xu. This follows from Lemma 2.1 of [23].
LetV:={Va}a∈Pbe an isometric representation of Pon a Hilbert space Hwith commuting
range projections. For s∈G, writes=a−bwitha,b∈P, and setWs:=V∗
bVa. Then, by
Prop. 3.4 of [22], Wsis a well-deﬁned partial isometry. For s∈G, setEs:=WsW∗
s. Thanks
to Prop. 3.4 of [22], {Es:s∈G}is a commuting family of projections.
Proposition 3.6. Keep the foregoing notation. There exists a unique projectio n valued measure
RonXuthat takes values in B(H)such that for a Borel set E⊂Xuands∈G,
WsR(E)W∗
s=R((E+s)∩Xu).
Proof.For the existence of such a projection valued measure, we ref er the reader to Lemma
7.1 of [22]. Suppose R1andR2are two projection valued measures on Xusuch that for i= 1,2,
WsRi(E)W∗
s=Ri((E+s)∩Xu)
for everys∈Gand for every Borel set E⊂Xu. Then, for s∈G,
R1((Xu+s)∩Xu) =WsW∗
s=R2((Xu+s)∩Xu).
As observed in Remark 3.5, {(Xu+s)∩Xu:s∈G}generates the Borel σ-algebra of Xu.
Hence,R1=R2. This completes the proof. ✷.

Proposition 3.7. LetV:={Va}a∈Pbe an isometric representation of Pon a Hilbert space H

Then,Vis pure if and only if Ris supported on Xu, i.e.R({G}) = 0.ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT 13

a∈PRan(Vna0). The

R(Xu+na0). By Remark 3.5, ( Xu+na0)n≥1ց {G}. Thus,R(Xu+na0)ցR({G}). Hence,/intersectiontext
n≥1Ran(Vna0) ={0}if and only if R({G}) = 0. This completes the proof. ✷
Next, we introducenotation to denote various subsets of the set of non-zero, Radon measures
onYu. Denote by M(Yu) the set of non-zero, Radon measures on Yu. Letβ∈R. Set
Mβ(Yu) : ={µ∈ M(Yu) :µise−βc-conformal },
Ma0(Yu) : ={µ∈ M(Yu) :µ(Xu\(Xu+a0)) = 1},
Mβ,a0(Yu) : =Mβ(Yu)∩Ma0(Yu),
Me(Yu) : ={µ∈ M(Yu) :µis ergodic for the G-action onYu},
Me,β(Yu) : =Mβ(Yu)∩Me(Yu),
Me,β,a0(Yu) : =Me,β(Yu)∩Ma0(Yu).
Lemma 3.8. For everya∈P,Xu\(Xu+a)has compact closure. Suppose K⊂Xuis a
compact subset. Then, there exists a∈Psuch thatK⊂Xu\(Xu+a).
Proof.Leta∈Pbe given. Observe that Xu\(Xu+a)⊂Xu\(X(0)
u+a) =Xu\(X(0)
u+a),
and the latter set is compact as Xuis compact, and X(0)
uis open. Hence, Xu\(Xu+a) has
compact closure.
LetK⊂Xube a compact subset. Note that Xu\(Xu+na0) is open in Xufor every
n≥1, and by Remark 3.5, ( Xu\(Xu+na0))nրXu. Thus, there exists n≥1 such that
K⊂Xu\(Xu+na0). This completes the proof. ✷
Lemma 3.9. Letµ∈ Mβ(Yu)be given. Then, µ(Xu\(Xu+a0))∈(0,∞). Consequently, there
exists a unique ν∈ Mβ,a0(Yu)and a unique positive number rsuch thatµ=rν.
Proof.it follows from Lemma 3.8 that µ(Xu\(Xu+a0)) is ﬁnite. Suppose that µ(Xu\(Xu+
a0)) = 0. Then, by the conformality condition, Xu+ka0\(Xu+(k+1)a0) is a null set for every
k≥0. By Remark 3.5, ( Xu+ka0)kց ∅. Hence,
Xu:=/coproductdisplay
k≥0(Xu+ka0\(Xu+(k+1)a0)).
Thus,Xuis a null set. The conformality condition forces that Xu−na0is a null set for every
n≥1. Again by Remark 3.5, Yu=/uniontext
n≥1(Xu−na0). Consequently, µ(Yu) = 0 which is a
contradiction. Hence the proof. ✷
Remark 3.10. Letβ1,β2be real numbers, and let µ∈ Mβ1(Yu). Supposeφ:Xu→Cis a
measurable function such that for every a∈P,
φ(A+a)−φ(A) =β2c(a)14 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
forµ-almost all A∈Xu.
Using the equality Yu:=/uniontext
a∈P(Xu−a) =/uniontext
n≥1(Xu−na0), it is not diﬃcult to prove that
there exists a measurable function /tildewideφ:Yu→Csuch that /tildewideφ|Xu=φ, and for every s∈G,
/tildewideφ(A+s)−/tildewideφ(A) =β2c(s)
forµ-almost all A∈Yu. We omit the proof as this is elementary.
Letβ∈Rbe a real number, and let µbe a non-zero, Radon measure on Xusuch that
µ(E+a) =e−βc(a)µ(E)for every Borel subset E⊂Xuand for every a∈P. Using the fact
thatYu=/uniontext
a∈P(Xu−a) =/uniontext
a∈P(X(0)
u−a), it is not diﬃcult to prove that there exists a unique
non-zero, Radon measure /tildewideµonYusuch that /tildewideµ|Xu=µ, and/tildewideµise−βc-conformal. We leave the
details to the reader.
Letµ∈ Mβ(Yu) be given. Consider the Koopman representation U:={Us}s∈GofGon
L2(Yu,µ), i.e.
Usf(A) :=eβc(s)
2f(A−s).
We viewL2(Xu,µ) as a closed subspace of L2(Yu,µ). The fact that Xu+P⊂Xuimplies that
{Ua}a∈PleavesL2(Xu,µ) invariant. For a∈P, set
Va:=Ua|L2(Xu,µ).
Then,V:={Va}a∈Pis a strongly, continuous semigroup of isometries on L2(Xu,µ) with
commuting range projections. To denote the dependence of Vonµ, we denote VbyVµ.
Proposition 3.11. Letβ∈R, and letµ∈ Mβ(Yu). Then,Vµise−βc
2-conformal. Moreovoer,
dimAβ(V) = 1if and only if µis ergodic.
Proof.LetV:=Vµ. Note that, in this case, the space LVcan be written as
LV:={φ:Xu→C:φis measurable, and for every a∈P,/integraldisplay
Xu\(Xu+a)|φ(A)|2dµ(A)<∞}.
As usual, we identify two functions if they agree almost ever ywhere. Thanks to Lemma 3.8,
LV=L2
loc(Xu,µ). The action of P,T:={Ta}a∈P, onLVis then given by
Taφ(A) =e−βc(a)
2φ(A+a).
Takeφ= 1Xu. Then,Taφ=e−βc(a)
2φfor everya∈P. Thus, the isometric representation Vis
e−βc
2-conformal.
Suppose that µis ergodic. Let φ∈ LVbe such that Taφ=e−βc(a)
2φ. Then, for every a∈P,
φ(A+a) =φ(A)
for almost all A∈Xu. Thanks to Remark 3.10, there exists a Borel function /tildewideφ:Yu→Cthat
extendsφand for every s∈G,/tildewideφ(A+s) =/tildewideφ(A) for almost all A∈Yu. The ergodicity of
µimplies that there exists c∈Csuch that /tildewideφ=ca.e. Thus, φ=c1Xu. Hence, Aβ(Vµ) is
1-dimensional if µis ergodic.ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT 15
Conversely, suppose that Aβ(V) is 1-dimensional. Let φ:Yu→Cbe a bounded Borel
function that is G-invariant. Then, φ|Xu∈ Aβ(V). Since dim Aβ(V) is 1-dimensional, there
existsc∈Csuch thatφ|Xu=c1Xu. Thus,φ(A) =cfor almost all A∈Xu. SinceYu=/uniontext
n≥1(Xu−na0) andφisG-invariant, it follows that φ(A) =cfor almost all A∈Yu. Hence,
µis ergodic. ✷
Remark 3.12. Letµ∈ Mβ(Yu), and letV:=Vµ. LetM:L∞(Xu,µ)→B(L2(Xu,µ))be
the multiplication representation. Suppose Ris the projection valued measure associated to V,
thenR(E) =M(1E)for every Borel set E⊂Xu.
To see this, for s=a−b∈G, witha,b∈P, setWs:=V∗
bVa. Then, for s∈G,
Wsf(A) :=

eβc(s)
2f(A−s)ifA−s∈Xu,
0 ifA−s /∈Xu
forf∈L2(Xu,µ). Routine computations show that for a Borel set E⊂Xu,
WsM(1E)W∗
s=M(1(E+s)∩Xu).
It follows from Prop. 3.6 that R(E) =M(1E)for every Borel subset E⊂Xu.
Proposition 3.13. Letβ1,β2∈R, and suppose µ1∈ Mβ1(Yu)andµ2∈ Mβ2(Yu). Then, the
following are equivalent.
(1)The isometric representations Vµ1andVµ2are unitarily equivalent.
(2)The measures µ1andµ2are absolutely continuous w.r.t. each other.
Proof.Clearly, (2) = ⇒(1). Suppose that (1) holds. Then, the projection valued mea sures
associated to Vµ1andVµ2are unitarily equivalent. It follows from Remark 3.12 that t he mul-
tiplication representations of C0(Xu) onL2(Xu,µ1) and onL2(Xu,µ2) are unitarily equivalent.
Hence,µ1|Xuandµ2|Xuare absolutely continuous. Thanks to the conformality cond ition of
µ1andµ2, it follows that, for every n≥1,µ1|Xu−na0andµ2|Xu−na0are absolutely continuous
w.r.t. each other. As observed in Remark 3.5, ( Xu−na0)nրYu. Hence,µ1andµ2are
absolutely continuous. This completes the proof. ✷
Proposition 3.14. Letβ∈R, and letµ∈ Mβ(Yu). Then, the following are equivalent.
(1)The isometric representation Vµis irreducible.
(2)The measure µis ergodic.
Proof.LetV:=Vµ, and letM:L∞(Xu,µ)→B(L2(Xu,µ)) be the multiplication represen-
tation. Assume that Vis irreducible. Suppose µis not ergodic. Let Ebe aG-invariant subset
ofYusuch thatEis neither null nor co-null. We claim that E∩XuandEc∩Xuhave positive
measure. Suppose E∩Xuis a null set. Then, for every n≥1,
µ(E∩(Xu−na0)) =µ((E−na0)∩(Xu−na0)) =µ((E∩Xu)−na0) =e−βc(na0)µ(E∩Xu) = 0.16 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
Thus,E∩(Xu−na0) has measure zero for every n. Thus,E=/uniontext
n≥1(E∩(Xu−na0)) has
measure zero, which is a contradiction. Therefore, E∩Xuis of positive measure. Similarly,
Ec∩Xuis of positive measure.
Therefore, Q:=M(1E∩Xu) is a non-trivial projection. Let a∈Pbe given. Calculate as
follows to observe that for ξ∈L2(Xu,µ) andA∈Xu,
QV∗
aξ(A) =e−βc(a)
21E∩Xu(A)ξ(A+a)
=e−βc(a)
21E(A)ξ(A+a)
=e−βc(a)
21E−a(A)1Xu−a(A)ξ(A+a) (sinceEisG-invariant, and Xu−a⊂Xu)
=e−βc(a)
21E∩Xu(A+a)ξ(A+a)
=V∗
aQξ(A).
Thus,Qcommutes with V∗
afor everya∈P. The fact that Qis self-adjoint implies that Q
commutes with Vafor everya∈P. Consequently, Qis a non-trivial projection such that
Q∈ {Va,V∗
a:a∈P}′. This contradicts the assumption that Vis irreducible. Hence, if Vis
irreducible, then µis ergodic.
Conversely, suppose µis ergodic. Let Ubea unitary that lies in the commutant {Va,V∗
a:a∈
P}′. SinceUintertwines VandV,Uintertwines the associated projection valued measures.
By Remark 3.12, we have
UM(1E)U∗=M(1E)
for every Borel set E⊂Xu. Thus,U∈M(L∞(Xu,µ))′=M(L∞(Xu,µ)).
Letφ:Xu→Tbe a Borel function such that U=M(φ). Thanks to the equality
V∗
aM(φ)Va=M(φ), for every a∈P, we have
(3.3) φ(A+a) =φ(A)
for almost all A∈Xu. Apply Remark 3.10 to extend φto a Borel function on Yu, which we
again denote by φ, such that given s∈G,
φ(A+s) =φ(A)
for almost all A∈Yu. Asµis ergodic, it follows that there exists a scalar csuch thatφ=c
a.e. Therefore, Uis a scalar multiple of the identity operator. Hence, Vis irreducible. This
completes the proof of the implication (2) = ⇒(1). ✷
LetI(P) be the collection (up to unitary equivalence) of pure isome tric representations of

We have shown that for β∈Rand for an ergodic, e−βc-conformal, non-zero Radon measure µ
onYu,Vµ∈ Iβ,r(P).
Proposition 3.15. The map
Me,β,a0(Yu)∋µ→Vµ∈ Iβ,r(P)
is1-1.
Proof.Letµ,ν∈ Me,β,a0(Yu) be such that Vµis unitarily equivalent to Vν. By Prop. 3.13,
it follows that µandνare absolutely continuous w.r.t. each other. Let f:Yu→(0,∞) be
a Borel function such that dµ=fdν. The fact that both µandνaree−βc-conformal implies
that for every s∈G,
f(A+s) =f(A)
forν-almost all A∈Yu. Sinceνis ergodic, there exists c∈(0,∞) such that f=ca.e. Thus,
µ=cν. The equality µ(Xu\(Xu+a0)) =ν(Xu\(Xu+a0)) = 1 implies that c= 1. Hence,
µ=ν. This completes the proof. ✷
The main point of this section is to show that the map
Me,β,a0(Yu)∋µ→Vµ∈ Iβ,r(P)
is surjective. As mentioned earlier, the proof is inspired b y the techniques of [11].
LetV={Va}a∈Pbe a pure, isometric representation of Pwith commuting range projections

LetRbe the projection valued measure associated to V. Set
H0:=span{R(E)ξa:E⊂Xuis Borel, and a∈P}.
The key theorem is the following.18 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
Theorem 3.16. With the foregoing notation, the closed subspace H0is invariant under {Va,V∗
a:
a∈P}, and there exists µ∈ Mβ(Yu)such thatVµis unitarily equivalent to V|H0.
The construction of the required measure µfor the above theorem is next explained in a
series of steps. Let a,b∈Pbe given, and let ξ∈Ker(V∗
b) be given. Then, Vaξ∈Ker(V∗
a+b).
Calculate as follows to observe that

Thus, fora,b∈P,

LetRbe the projection valued measure associated to V. Recall that we have the following
equations. For every a∈Pand for a Borel subset E⊂Xu,
(3.6) V∗
aR(E)Va=R((E−a)∩Xu)
and
(3.7) VaR(E)V∗
a=R(E+a).
(1) Leta∈P, and letµabe the measure on Xudeﬁned by the equation
µa(E) :=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tR(E)ξa|ξa/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht
for a Borel subset EofXu. Observe that
µa(Xu+a) =/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tR(Xu+a)ξa|ξa/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht
=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tVaV∗
aξa|ξa/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht(by Eq. 3.7)
= 0 (sinceξa∈Ker(V∗

In other words, µais supported on Xu\(Xu+a). Moreover, for a Borel subset E⊂
Xu\(Xu+a),
µa(E) =/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tR(E)ξa|ξa/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht.
(2) The family of measures {µa:a∈P}is consistent in the following sense. Suppose Eis
a Borel subset such that E⊂Xu\(Xu+a) andE⊂Xu\(Xu+b) fora,b∈P. Then,
µa(E) =µb(E). To see this, ﬁrst consider the case where b≥a, i.e.b−a∈P. Write
b=a+dwithd∈P. Suppose E⊂Xu\(Xu+a). Then,E⊂Xu\(Xu+a+d).

=µa(E).
Leta,b∈Pbe given. Suppose Eis a Borel subset of Xusuch thatEis contained in
(Xu\(Xu+a))∩(Xu\(Xu+b))⊂Xu\(Xu+a+b). The reasoning made so far implies
that
µa(E) =µa+b(E) =µb(E).
Consequently, the family of measures {µa:a∈P}is consistent.
(3) Using the fact that ( Xu\(Xu+na0))nրXuand the fact that the family of measures
{µna0:n≥1}is consistent, we see that there exists a unique measure µonXusuch
that ifEis a Borel subset of Xu\(Xu+na0) for somen≥1, then
µ(E) =/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tR(E)ξna0|ξna0/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht.
Since{na0:n≥1}is coﬁnal and the family of measures {µa:a∈P}is consistent, we
see that for a∈Pand a Borel subset E⊂Xu\(Xu+a), we have
(3.8) µ(E) =/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tR(E)ξa|ξa/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht.
In particular, for every a∈P,µ(Xu\(Xu+a)) =/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tE⊥
aξa|ξa/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tξa|ξa/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht<∞. It follows
from Lemma 3.8 that µis a Radon measure. Since ξais non-zero for some a∈P,
µ(Xu\(Xu+a)) =/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tξa|ξa/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht>0
for somea∈P. Thus,µis a non-zero, Radon measure.
(4) We claim that for every Borel subset E⊂Xuanda∈P,µ(E+a) =e−βc(a)µ(E). Let
a∈Pand letE⊂Xube a Borel subset. Since Xu:=/uniontext
n≥1(Xu\(Xu+na0)), it suﬃces
to consider the case when E⊂Xu\(Xu+b) for someb∈P. Then,

Also, ifE∈ B0andb∈P, then (E−b)∩Xu∈ B0. To see this, suppose E∈ B0and
b∈P. We can choose nlarge such that na0−b∈PandE⊂Xu\Xu+na0. Then,
(E−b)∩Xu⊂((Xu−b)\(Xu+na0−b))∩Xu⊂Xu\(Xu+na0−b).
Leta∈Pbe given. Since ξa∈Ker(V∗

(3.9) R(E)ξa=R(E∩(Xu\(Xu+a)))ξa.
Thus,
H0:=span{R(E)ξa:E∈ B0,a∈P}.
We claim that H0is invariant under {Va,V∗

R(E)ξa=R(E)E⊥
aξa+b=R(E)R(Xu\(Xu+a))ξa+b=R(E)ξa+b.
Similarly,R(E)ξb=R(E)ξa+b. Hence,

µas a closed subspace of L2(Xu,µ).
Note thatHn

Thus, there exists an isometry Un:Hn

Thanks to Eq. 3.10, the isometries Unpatch together to deﬁne a well deﬁned isometry

It follows from the above equality and Eq. 3.9, that the range ofUisH0.

Remark 3.17. Note thatH0is the smallest closed subspace that contains {ξa:a∈P}and
that is invariant under {Va,V∗
a:a∈P}.
The caseβ= 0deserves special emphasis. Let ξ:P→Hbe a map. The map ξis called an
additive cocycle if
(1)fora∈P,ξa∈Ker(V∗
a), and
(2)ξsatisﬁes the cocycle equation, i.e for a,b∈P,ξa+b=ξa+Vaξb.
Denote the set of additive cocycles by A(V). It is clear, from the cocycle equation, that if
ξ∈ A(V), then{ξa}a∈Pis coherent. Let ξ∈ A(V). Letφ∈ DVbe such that
φ(ξ) =/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tξ|ξa/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht

Hence,Taφ=φfor everya∈P. It is not diﬃcult to show that every T={Ta}a∈P-invariant

Theorem 3.18. Letβ∈R. The map

is a bijection.
Proof.It was observed in Prop. 3.15 that the prescribed map is 1-1. L etV∈ Iβ,r(P)
be given. It follows from Thm. 3.16 that there exists µ∈ Mβ(Yu) such that Vµis a direct
summand of V. Thanks to Lemma 3.9, we can assume that µ(Xu\(Xu+a0)) = 1. Since Vis
irreducible, VandVµare unitarily equivalent. The ergodicity of µfollows from Prop. 3.14.
The proof is complete. ✷
Proposition 3.19. Letβ∈R, and letV∈ Iβ,r(P). Supposeµ∈ Me,β(Yu)is such that Vµis
unitarily equivalent to V. Then, the following are equivalent.
(1)The measure class [µ]contains aG-invariant, non-zero, Radon measure on Yu.
(2)The isometric representation Vis1-conformal.

LetH⊂Gbe a closed subgroup. Note that Gacts onG/Hby translations. By a P-space

is a strongly continuous semigroup of isometries with commu ting range projections. We denote
VbyVB, and callVBthe isometric representation associated to B.
The proof of the following proposition is clear, and hence om itted.
Proposition 3.20. Letβ∈R, and letV∈ Iβ,r(P)be given. Suppose µ∈ Me,β(Yu)is such
thatVµis unitarily equivalent to V. Assume that µis concentrated on an orbit of a point
A∈Yu. Denote the stabiliser of AbyGA. Letπ:G→G/GAbe the quotient map, and let
B:=−π(A). Then,Bis aP-space inG/GA, andVis unitarily equivalent to VB.
Letβ∈R, and letV∈ Iβ,r(P). Fort∈R, letVt:={Vt
a}a∈Pbe the semigroup of isometries
deﬁned byVt
a:=eitc(a)Va.
Proposition 3.21. Keep the foregoing notation. Suppose β/\e}atio\slash= 0. Letµ∈ Me,β(Yu)be such
thatVis unitarily equivalent to Vµ. Then, the following are equivalent.
(1)The measure class [µ]contains aG-invariant, σ-ﬁnite measure on Yu.
(2)For everyt∈R,VandVtare unitarily equivalent.
(3)There exists δ>0such thatVandVtare unitarily equivalent for every t∈[0,δ].
(4)There exists δ>0such that for every t∈[0,δ],Vtise−βc
2-conformal.
Proof.We can assume that V=Vµ. LetM:L∞(Xu,µ)→B(L2(Xu,µ)) be the multi-
plication representation. Suppose that [ µ] contains a G-invariant, σ-ﬁnite measure νonYu.
Writedν=eβgdµfor some Borel function g:Yu→R. The fact that νisG-invariant and µis
e−βc-conformal implies that for every s∈G,
g(A+s)−g(A) =c(s)
for almost all A∈Yu. Fort∈R, setUt:=M(eitg). Then, it is routine to verify that for a∈P,
UtVaU∗
t=eitc(a)Va.
Hence, for every t∈R,VandVtare unitarily equivalent.
Conversely, assume that (2) holds. Choose a dense, countabl e subsemigroup Γ +ofP, and let
C∗(Γ+) be the universal, unital C∗-algebra generated by a semigroup of isometries {vγ}γ∈Γ+.
By the universal property of C∗(Γ+), there exists a representation πofC∗(Γ) onL2(Xu,µ)
such thatπ(vγ) =Vγfor everyγ∈Γ+. Again by the universal property of C∗(Γ+), for every
t∈R, there exists a representation πtofC∗(Γ+) such that πt(vγ) =eitc(γ)Vγ. It is clear that
the family {πt}t∈Rmoves ‘measurably‘, i.e. for ξ,η∈L2(Xu,µ), andx∈C∗(Γ+), the map
R∋t→ /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tπt(x)ξ|η/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht ∈C24 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
is measurable.
The given hypothesis implies that for every t∈R,πandπtare unitarily equivalent. By the
corollary to Lemma 4.1.4 of [4], for every t∈R, there exists a unitary operator UtonL2(Xu,µ)
such that
(1) forξ,η∈L2(Xu,µ), the map R∋t→ /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tUtξ|η/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht ∈Cis measurable, and
(2) for every t,Utπ(·)U∗
t=πt(·).
In particular, for every t∈R, and for every γ∈Γ+,UtVγU∗
t=eitc(γ)Vγ. Since Γ +is dense
inP, it follows that for every t∈Rand for every a∈P,UtVaU∗
t=eitc(a)Va.
Lets,t∈R. Fora∈P, calculate as follows to observe that

Thus,U∗
s+tUsUt∈ {Va,Va:a∈P}′. SinceVis irreducible, there exists ω(s,t)∈Tsuch that
UsUt=ω(s,t)Us+t.
Clearly,ω:R×R→Tis measurable, and is a multiplier. As H2(R,T) = 0, it follows that
there exists a Borel function f:R→Tsuch that for s,t∈T,ω(s,t) =f(s+t)
f(s)f(t). Replacing Ut
byf(t)Ut, we can assume that UsUt=Us+tfor everys,t∈R.
Thus, there exists a strongly continuous (as every weakly me asurable 1-parameter group of
unitaries is strongly continuous) 1-parameter group of uni tariesU:={Ut}t∈RonL2(Xu,µ)
such that for every a∈Pand fort∈R,
(3.11) UtVaU∗
t=eitc(a)Va.
WriteUt=eitDwithDbeing the Stone generator.
LetRbe the projection valued measure associated to V. It is also clear that Ris the
projection valued measure associated to Vtfor everyt∈R. Moreover, R(E) =M(1E) for
every Borel subset E⊂Xu. Eq. 3.11 implies that for every t∈R,UtR(E)U∗

Borel function g:Xu→R. Then, for t∈R,Ut=M(eitg).

Thus, for every a∈Pand for every t∈R,eit(c(a)+g(A))=eitg(A+a)for almost all A∈Xu.
Hence, for every a∈P,
g(A+a)−g(A) =c(a)ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT 25
for almost all A∈Xu. By Remark 3.10, there exists a Borel function, which we agai n denote

g(A+s)−g(A) =c(s)

Note thatTis a subgroup of R. Therefore, (3) = ⇒(2). This completes the proof of the
equivalence (2) ⇐⇒(3).
Clearly, (3) = ⇒(4) asVise−βc
2-conformal. Assume that (4) holds. Let δ >0 be such
that for every t∈[0,δ],Vtise−βc

writeLV=L2
loc(Xu,µ). The action of P,T={Ta}a∈P, corresponding to V, onLVis given by
Taf(A) =e−βc(a)
2f(A+a).
Similarly, we can write LVt=L2
loc(Xu,µ). Then, the action of Pcorresponding to Vt,Tt=
{Tt

Tt
af(A) =e−itc(a)e−βc(a)
2f(A+a).
The hypothesis implies that there exists a non-zero g∈L2
loc(Xu,µ) such that for every a∈P,
Tt

2g.
In other words, for every a∈P,
(3.12) g(A+a) =eitc(a)g(A)
for almost all A∈Xu. Then, for every a∈P,|g(A+a)|=|g(A)|for almost all A∈Xu.
Appealing to Remark 3.10 and using the fact that µis ergodic, we see that there exists c>0
such that |g|=ca.e. Without loss of generality, we can assume |g|= 1. LetU:=M(g),
whereM:L∞(Xu,µ)→B(L2(Xu,µ)) is the multiplication representation. Then, by routine
computation, we see that for every a∈P,

This completes the proof of the implication (4) = ⇒(3). ✷26 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT

LetM:L∞(Yu,µ)→B(L2(Yu,µ)) be the multiplication representation. Note that for

the Borelσ-algebra of Yu, it follows that the von Neumann algebra generated by {M(1Xu+s) :

D⋊G=L∞(Yu)⋊G. The proof follows. ✷28 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT

2gi(y)for almost all y∈Y.
Then, there exists c∈Csuch thatg1=cg2.
Proposition 3.26. Supposeµis ergodic. We have the following.
(1)Vis1-conformal if and only if for every a∈P,µ(X\(X+a))<∞.
(2)For everyβ∈R,dimAβ(V)∈ {0,1}.

The action of P,T:={Ta}a∈P, onLVis then given by

fora∈Pandf∈ LV.
Suppose that Vis 1-conformal. Then, there exists a non-zero f∈ LVsuch that for every
a∈P,f(x+a) =f(x) for almost all x∈X. Appealing to Remark 3.24 and using the fact
thatµis ergodic, we see that there exists a non-zero complex numbe rcsuch thatf(x) =cfor
almost allx∈X. The fact that for every a∈P,
/integraldisplay
X\(X+a)|f(x)|2dx<∞
implies that µ(X\(X+a))<∞for everya∈P. Conversely, suppose µ(X\(X+a))<∞for
everya∈P. Then, 1 X∈ LV, andTa(1X) = 1X. Hence,Vis 1-conformal. This completes the
proof of (1).
Letβ∈Rbe given. Suppose that Aβ(V) is non-zero. Let g1,g2∈ Aβ(V) be two non-zero
elements. Then, for i= 1,2, and for every a∈P,gi(x+a) =e−βc(a)
2gi(x) for almost all x∈X.
Appealing to Remark 3.24 and to Lemma 3.25, we see that there e xists a non-zero complex
number such that g1=cg2. Hence, dim Aβ(V) = 1. ✷
Proposition 3.27. The Koopman representation of GonL2(Y,µ)is the minimal unitary
dilation ofV.
Proof.LetU:={Us}s∈Gbe the Koopman representation of GonL2(Yu,µ). Recall that for

Usf(y) :=f(y−s).
ViewL2(X,µ) as a subspace of L2(Y,µ) in the obvious way. Clearly, for a∈Pandf∈
L2(X,µ),Ua(f) =Va(f). Note that, for n≥1,U∗
na0L2(X,µ) =L2(X−na0,µ). Since
{na0:n≥1}is coﬁnal, (X−na0)րY. Consequently, we have that the union

n≥1L2(X−na0,µ)

Thanks to Prop. 2.1, it suﬃces to prove Thm. 1.1 for β >0. Letβbe a positive real number
ﬁxed for the rest of this section. For the rest of the paper, le tG:=Z2, and letP:=N2. Fix a
positive real number θ, and letc:Z2→Rbe the homomorphism deﬁned by c(m,n) =m+nθ.30 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
Recall that the potential χ: Ω→Ris deﬁned by

Sete1:= (1,0),e2:= (0,1),v1:=e1, andv2:=e1+e2. Recall that

Xu:={A∈Yu: 0∈A}.
Supposeθ=p
qis rational, where gcd(p,q) = 1. Choose a matrix/bracketleftBigg

z w/bracketrightBigg
∈SL2(Z) such
thatx,y,z,w ≥0, and
x+z=q;y+w=p.
Letφ:Z2→Z2be the isomorphism that corresponds to the matrix/bracketleftBigg

z w/bracketrightBigg
. Note that
φ(N2)⊂N2. We denote the homomorphism Z2→Rthat sends e1→1 ande2→θbycθ. If
θ= 1, we denote cθsimply byc. It is clear that1
q(c◦φ) =cθ.
LetY:=Yu, and deﬁne a Z2-action onYby
A⊕(m,n) =A+φ(m,n).
Proposition 4.1. With the above notation, we have the following.
(1)Ifµis ane−βc
q-conformal measure on Yu, thenµis ane−βcθ-conformal measure on the
Z2-spaceY.
(2)LetΦ :Y→Yube the map deﬁned by
Φ(A) =φ−1(A).
Then, the map Φis aZ2-equivariant, embedding which is proper, i.e. Φ−1(K)is compact
for every compact subset K⊂Yu. Consequently, if µis an ergodic, e−βc
q-conformal,
non-zero, Radon measure on Yu, thenµ◦Φ−1is an ergodic, e−βcθ-conformal, non-zero,
Radon measure on Yu. Moreover, µandµ◦Φ−1have the same Krieger type.
Proof.The only thing that requires veriﬁcation is the fact that Φ is proper. Let K⊂Yube
a compact subset. Since ( Xu−nv2)nis an increasing sequence of open sets which increases to
Yu, it follows that there exists n≥1 such that K⊂Xu−nv2. Note that
Φ−1(K) = Φ−1(K+nv2)⊖nv2.
Thus, it suﬃces to prove that Φ−1(K+nv2) is compact. In other words, we can assume that
K⊂Xu.
By Lemma 3.8, there exists ( m,n)∈N2such thatK⊂Xu\(Xu+(m,n)). Hence, it suﬃces
to show that Φ−1(Xu\(Xu+(m,n))) has compact closure. Observe that Φ−1(Xu) =Xu. Thus,ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT 31
Φ−1(Xu\(Xu+(m,n)) =Xu\(Xu⊕(m,n)) =Xu\(Xu+φ(m,n)). Sinceφ(m,n)∈N2, itfollows
from Lemma 3.8 that Xu\(Xu+φ(m,n)) has compact closure. Hence, Φ−1(Xu\(Xu+(m,n)))
has compact closure. ✷
Remark 4.2. In view of Prop. 4.1 and Prop. 2.4, Thm. 1.1 holds for a rational θif we
establish its validity for θ= 1.
Letψ:Z2→Z2be the isomorphism that corresponds to the matrix/bracketleftBigg

Proposition 4.3. With the foregoing notation, the map Ψ :Yu→Yudeﬁned by
Ψ(A) =ψ−1(A)
is a homeomorphism. Let θ >0, and letδ=1

Remark 4.4. In view of Prop. 4.3 and Prop. 2.4, it suﬃces to prove Thm. 1.1 whe nθ≥1.
Proposition 4.5. Letµ∈ Me,β. Suppose that µis concentrated on an orbit of a point, say
A. LetGAbe the stabiliser of A, i.e.
GA:={(m,n)∈Z2:A+(m,n) =A}.
IfGA/\e}atio\slash= 0, thenVµis1-conformal.
Proof.Lemma 3.9 allows us to assume µ(Xu\(Xu+v2)) = 1. As in Prop. 2.3, we identify
Yuwith Ω×Zvia theZ2-equivariant homeomorphism
Ω×Z∋(x,t)→A(x,t)∈Yu.
Recall that the action of Z2on Ω×Zis given by
(x,t)+v1: = (τ(x),x−1+t),
(x,t)+v2: = (x,t+1).
Thanks to Prop. 2.4, there exists a unique e−βχ-conformal, probability measure mon Ω such
that
µ(E×{n}) =e−βn(1+θ)m(E)
for every Borel set E⊂Ω and for every n∈Z.
By translating Aif necessary, we can assume that A=A(x,0) for some x∈Ω. The fact
thatGAis non-zero implies that xis a periodic point. Let pbe the period of x, and let
Ωm:={x,τ(x),···,τp−1(x)}. Then,mis concentrated on Ω m, andµis concentrated on
Ωm×Z.
Letdm0be the counting measure on Ω m, and letdnbe the counting measure on Z. Then,
dm0×dnis aZ2-invariant, non-zero, Radon measure on Ω m×Z, and hence on Ω ×Z(as32 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
Ωmis a compact subset of Ω) that is equivalent to µ. It follows from Prop. 3.19 that Vµis
1-conformal. This completes the proof. ✷
To proceed further, we need the following two facts from ergo dic theory.
(A1) Thereexists aninﬁnitemeasurepreserving, conservat ive, ergodictransformation Tsuch
that the maximal spectral type of the Koopman operator UTand the Lebesgue measure
are mutulally singular.
(A2) Given an irrational α, there exists an inﬁnite measure preserving, conservative , ergodic
transformation Tsuch thatT×Rαis ergodic and the maximal spectral type of UT×Rα
and the Lebesgue measure are mutually singular. Here, Rαis the irrational rotation
on [0,1) deﬁned by Rα(x) =x+αmod 1, and the measure on [0 ,1) is the Lebesgue
measure.
It follows from the results of [10] and [2] that Kakutani towe rs over adding machine provide
such transformations. We make a small digression into these issues.
Let
D:={(x1,x2,···) :xn∈ {0,1}}
be the group of dyadic integers, and let Sbe the transformation on Dthat corresponds to
addition by 1. The measure that we consider on Dis the Haar measure which we denote by
dν. Then,Sis measure preserving, ergodic and conservative. Remove fr omDthe sequences
that are eventually constant, and denote the resulting set a gain byD.
Let (nk)∞
k=1be a sequence of positive integers such that nk+1>3nk. Deﬁne a ‘height
function’h:D →Nas follows: for x∈ D, letkbe the least integer such that xk= 0. Set
h(x) :=nk−k−1/summationdisplay

Let
Dh:={(x,n)∈ D ×N: 1≤n≤h(x)}.
LetT:Dh→ Dhbe deﬁned by
T(x,n) :=

(x,n+1) ifn≤h(x)−1,
(Sx,1) ifn=h(x).
Consider the measure dνdn, wherednis the counting measure on N, onDh. Then,Tis a
measure preserving, ergodic, conservative transformatio n onDh. It can be checked that Dh
has inﬁnite measure (see Remark (Pages 67-68) in [10]). Let UTbe the Koopman operator
associated to T. Recall that UTis the unitary operator on L2(Dh) deﬁned by
UT(f) =f◦T−1.ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT 33
In [10], it was shown (Thm. 4.4.1, Page 66 of [10]) that the max imal spectral type of UTis the
Riesz product
∞/productdisplay
k=1(1+cos(2πnkt)).
It is well known ([21]) that the Riesz product∞/productdisplay
k=1(1+cos(2πnkt)) and the Lebesgue measure
are mutually singular. This ensures (A1).
To ensure (A2), the sequence ( nk) has to be chosen appropriately. Let αbe an irrational
number. Choose a sequence ( nk) of positive integers such that nk+1>3nkande2πinkα→e2πiα
ask→ ∞. Thanks to Thm. 2.2 of [2], the set of L∞-eigen values of T, denotede(T), is given
by
(4.15) e(T) :={e2πis∈T:∞/summationdisplay
k=1|1−e2πinks|2<∞}.
The fact that e2πinkα→e2πiαimplies that e2πinkℓα→e2πiℓαfor everyℓ∈Z\{0}. Sinceαis
irrational, it is clear from Eq. 4.15 that e2πiℓα/∈e(T) for every ℓ∈Z\{0}. By the ergodic
multiplier theorem (Thm. 2.7.1 of [1]), it follows that T×Rαis ergodic.
Note that
UT×Rα=/circleplusdisplay
ℓ∈Ze2πiℓαUT.
Itfollowsfromtheaboveequality andthefactthatthemaxim alspectralof UTandtheLebesgue
measure are singular that the maximal spectral type of UT×Rαand the Lebesgue measure are

Now, we proceed towards proving Thm. 1.1.
The caseθ= 1:Letβ >0 be a ﬁxed real number. Let c:Z2→Rbe the homomorphism

Thus,
f(Tx)−f(x)≥ −1
for everyx∈X.
LetY:=X×Z. Consider the measure dνdnonY, wherednis the counting measure on Z.
Let
X:={(x,n)∈X×Z:n≥ −f(x)}.
Deﬁne a Z2-action onYby
(x,n)+e1: = (x,n+1),
(x,n)+e2: = (Tx,n+1).
Clearly, the Z2-action onYis measure preserving. The ergodicity of Timplies that the Z2-
action is ergodic. The fact that f◦T−f≥ −1 implies that X+N2⊂X. Note that ( Y,X) is
a pure (Z2,N2)-space.
LetV:={V(m,n)}(m,n)∈N2betheisometricrepresentationassociatedtothetriple( Y,X,dνdn).
Recall that V(1,0)andV(0,1)are deﬁned by

Note that

Hence, for every ( m,n)∈N2andt∈R,

t=eitc(m,n)V(m,n).
Appealing to Thm. 3.22, we see that there exists an ergodic, e−βc-conformal, non-zero,
Radon measure µonYusuch that
(1)Vµis a direct summand of V, and
(2) the measure class [ µ] contains a σ-ﬁnite,Z2-invariant measure.
Theorem 4.6. The measure µis of typeII∞.
Proof.Appealing to Remark 3.2 and the fact that Vis not 1-conformal, we conclude that
Vµis not 1-conformal. By Prop. 3.19, it follows that the measur e class [µ] does not contain a
Z2-invariant, Radon measure. Thus, µis not of type II1.
Supposeµis atomic, and is concentrated on the orbit of a point A∈Yu. SinceVµis not
1-conformal, it follows from Prop. 4.5 that the stabiliser GAofAis zero. Set B:=−A. Then,
it follows from Prop. 3.20 that Vµis unitarily equivalent to the isometric representation Won
ℓ2(B) deﬁned by
W(m,n)(δ(r,s)) =δ(r+m,s+n).
SinceWis a direct summand of V, it follows that the minimal unitary dilation of Wis a
direct summand of the minimal unitary dilation of V. It follows from Prop. 3.27 that the
minimal unitary dilation of Wis the regular representation λ:={λ(m,n)}(m,n)∈Z2ofZ2on
ℓ2(Z2). Again by Prop. 3.27, it follows that the minimal unitary di lation ofVis the Koopman
representation /tildewideU:={/tildewideU(m,n)}(m,n)∈Z2ofZ2onL2(Y). Hence,λis a subrepresentation of /tildewideU.
Thus, for every ( m,n),/tildewideU(m,n)is of the form
/tildewideU(m,n)=/bracketleftBigg
λ(m,n)0

.
Note that /tildewideU(−1,1)=UT⊗1, whereUTis the Koopman operator associated to the ergodic
transformation T, andλ(−1,1)is unitarily equivalent to U⊗1, whereUis the bilateral shift on
ℓ2(Z).36 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
Hence,UT⊗1 is of the form
UT⊗1 =/bracketleftBigg
U⊗1 0
0∗/bracketrightBigg
.
The above equality contradicts the fact the maximal spectra l type ofUTand the Lebesgue
measure on Tare singular. Hence, µis not atomic. The proof is complete. ✷
We have now established Thm. 1.1 when θis rational (see Remark 4.2).
Suppose that θis irrational. As observed in Prop. 4.3, we can assume that θ >1. Let
α:=θ−⌊θ⌋, where⌊θ⌋is the integral part of θ. Letc:Z2→Rbe the homomorphism deﬁned
byc(m,n) =m+nθ.
LetRαbe the map on [0 ,1) deﬁned by Rα(x) =x+αmod 1. The measure that we
consider on [0 ,1) is the Lebesgue measure. Fix a σ-ﬁnite measure space ( X,B,ν) and an
invertible, measure preserving transformation T:X→Xsuch that
(1)ν(X) =∞, and
(2)T×Rαis ergodic, conservative and the maximal spectral type of th e Koopman operator
UT×Rαand the Lebesgue measure on Tare singular.
Fix a measurable set A⊂Xsuch that 0 < ν(A)<∞. Deﬁne the sets ( En)∞
n=0and the
functionf:X→Zas in the case θ= 1. We have f(Tx)−f(x)≥ −1 for every x∈X.
LetY:=X×R. Consider the measure dνdsonY, wheredsis the Lebesgue measure on R.
Set
X:={(x,s)∈X×R:s≥ −f(x)}.
Deﬁne a Z2-action onYby settting
(x,s)+e1: = (x,s+1),
(x,s)+e2: = (Tx,s+θ) = (Tx,s+⌊θ⌋+α).
The ergodicity of T×Rαimplies that the Z2-action onYis ergodic. As in the case θ= 1, we
haveX+N2⊂X. Moreover, ( Y,X) is a pure ( Z2,N2)-space.
LetV:={V(m,n)}(m,n)∈N2betheisometricrepresentationassociatedtothetriple( Y,X,dνds).

It follows from Lemma 3.3 that Vise−βc

The following facts can be established as in the case θ= 1.
(a) The isometric representation Vis not 1-conformal.
(b) There exists a strongly continuous group of unitaries U:={Ut}t∈Rsuch that for t∈R
and (m,n)∈N2,
UtV(m,n)U∗

Appealing to Thm. 3.22, we see that there exists an ergodic, e−βc-conformal, non-zero,
Radon measure µonYusuch that
(1)Vµis a direct summand of V, and
(2) the measure class [ µ] contains a σ-ﬁnite,Z2-invariant measure.
We will show that µis of typeII∞. This requires expressing the isometric representation Vin
a slightly diﬀerent form which we do next.
LetX0:=X×[0,1). The measure that we consider on X0isdνds, wheredsis the Lebesgue
measure on [0 ,1). Note that the map
X0×Z∋((x,s),m)→(x,s−f(x)+m)∈Y
is a measure preserving, Borel isomorphism. This way, we ide ntifyYwithX0×Z. Then,X
gets identiﬁed with X0×N. Transport the Z2-action onYtoX0×Z. Then, the action of e1
is given by
(4.17) (( x,s),m)+e1= ((x,s),m+1).
To describe, the action of e2, we introduce some notation. Let φ:X→Zbe deﬁned by
φ(x) =f(Tx)−f(x)+⌊θ⌋.
Fork≥0, letIk:={x∈X:φ(x) =k}. The action of e2is given by

SetI−1=∅. Fork≥0, letPkbe the multiplication operator on L2(X0) that corresponds to
the characteristic function 1 (Ik×[0,1−α))∪(Ik−1×[1−α,1)). With the Hilbert space L2(X) identiﬁed
withL2(X0×N)∼=L2(X0)⊗ℓ2(N), Eq. 4.17 and Eq. 4.18 allow us to write the operators
V(1,0)andV(0,1)as

and
(4.20) V(0,1)=∞/summationdisplay
k=0UT×RαPk⊗Sk.
In the above equations, Sstands for the unilateral shift on ℓ2(N).
Theorem 4.7. The measure µis of typeII∞.
Proof.Supposeµis not of type II∞. Then, arguing as in Prop. 4.6, we see that µis
supported on an orbit of a point, say A, whose stabiliser is zero. Set B:=−A. Then,Vµis
unitarily equivalent to the isometric representation W:={(W(m,n)}(m,n)∈Z2onℓ2(B) deﬁned
by
W(m,n)(δ(r,s)) =δ(r+m,n+s).
SinceWis a direct summand of VandV(1,0)is a pure isometry, W(1,0)is a pure isometry.
This implies that
(4.21)/intersectiondisplay
m≥1(B+(m,0)) =∅.
The fact that B+e1⊂Bimplies that given n∈Z,{m∈Z: (m,n)∈B}is either empty
or is an interval in Z. Eq. 4.21 implies that for every n∈Z, the set {m∈Z: (m,n)∈B}is
bounded below. For n∈Z, set
an:= inf{m∈Z: (m,n)∈B}.
Note thatancould be inﬁnity for some n.
We claim that B={(m,n)∈Z2:m≥an}. The inclusion ⊂is clear. Suppose ( m,n)∈Z2
is such that m≥an. Then,anis ﬁnite. By deﬁnition, ( an,n)∈B. SinceB+(m−an,0)⊂B,
it follows that ( m,n)∈B. This proves the claim.
The fact that B+e2⊂Bimplies that the sequence ( an) is decreasing, i.e. for n∈Z,
an+1≤an. Let
F:={n∈Z:an<∞}.
Note thatFis non-empty as Bis non-empty. Also, since ( an) is decreasing, it follows that
F+1⊂F. Hence,Fis an interval. For k≥0, let
Fk:={n∈F:an−an+1=k}.
Fork≥0, letQk:ℓ2(F)→ℓ2(F) be the projection onto ℓ2(Fk). We denote both the right
shift onℓ2(F) andℓ2(N) by the same letter S.
We identify BwithF×Nvia the map
F×N∋(r,s)→(s+ar,r)∈B.
Onceℓ2(B) is identiﬁed with ℓ2(F×N) =ℓ2(F)⊗N, the operator W(1,0)onℓ2(F×N) is given
(4.22) W(1,0)(δ(r,s)) =δ(r,s+1).ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT 39
In other words, W(1,0)= 1⊗S. The operator W(0,1)onℓ2(F×N) is given by
W(0,1)(δ(r,s)) =δ(r+1,s+k)ifr∈Fk.
In other words,
(4.23) W(0,1)=∞/summationdisplay
k=0SQk⊗Sk.
SinceWis a direct summand of V, it follows there exists a bounded linear operator J:
ℓ2(F)⊗ℓ2(N)→L2(X0)⊗ℓ2(N), which is also an isometry, such that
JW(m,n)=V(m,n)JandJW∗
(m,n)=V∗
(m,n)J.
Thus,J(1⊗S) = (1⊗S)J, andJ(1⊗S∗) = (1⊗S∗)J. Hence,Jis of the form J=J0⊗1,
whereJ0:ℓ2(F)→L2(X0) is an isometry.
Thanks to Eq. 4.20, Eq. 4.23, and the equality ( J0⊗1)W(0,1)=V(0,1)(J0⊗1), we have
J0SQk=UT×RαPkJ0
for everyk≥0. Since/summationtext
kQk= 1 and/summationtext
k=1Pk= 1, we have J0S=UT×RαJ0.
The equality ( J0⊗1)W∗
(0,1)=V∗
(0,1)(J0⊗1) leads to the equation J0S∗=U∗
T×RαJ0. In other
words,UT×Rαis of the form
UT×Rα=/bracketleftBigg
S0
0∗/bracketrightBigg
.
Hence,Sis indeed a unitary operator which forces F=Z. Let us change notation, and denote
the bilateral shift on ℓ2(Z) byU. Then,UT×Rαis of the form
UT×Rα=/bracketleftBigg
U0
0∗/bracketrightBigg
.
The above equality is a contradiction to our assumption that the maximal spectral type of
UT×Rαand the Lebesgue measure on Tare singular. Hence, our initial assumption is wrong.
Consequently, µis of typeII∞. The proof is complete. ✷
Theorem 1.1 is now a consequence of Thm. 4.6, Thm. 4.7, Prop. 2 .4, Remark 4.2 and
Remark 4.4.
5.TypeIIIexamples for a rational θ
In this section, we prove Thm. 1.2. Thanks to Prop. 2.1, Prop. 4.1 and Prop. 2.4, it suﬃces
to prove Thm. 1.2 under the assumption β >0 andθ= 1. Letθ= 1. Letc:Z2→Rbe the
homomorphism that sends e1→1 ande2→1.
Let (Y,X) be a pure ( Z2,N2)-space. Recall that this means that Yis a standard Borel space
on which Z2-acts measurably, X+N2⊂X,/uniontext
(m,n)∈N2(X−(m,n)) =Y, and/intersectiontext
(m,n)∈N2(X+
(m,n)) =∅. Letνbeσ-ﬁnite measure on Ywhich ise−βc-conformal. Assume that ν(X)∈
(0,∞). LetU:={U(m,n)}(m,n)∈Z2be the Koopman representation of Z2onL2(Y,ν). Note that40 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
X+N2⊂Ximplies that L2(X,ν) is invariant under {U(m,n): (m,n)∈N2}. SetH:=L2(X,ν),
and letV:={V(m,n)}(m,n)∈N2be the isometric representation on Hdeﬁned by
V(m,n):=U(m,n)|H.
Notice that for ( m,n)∈N2,V∗
(m,n)(1X) =e−βc(m,n)
21X. Thus,Vise−βc
2-conformal. Let
M:L∞(Y,ν)→B(L2(Y,ν)) be the multiplication representation.
Proposition 5.1. Keep the foregoing notation. Assume that νis ergodic. The following are
equivalent.
(1)The isometric representation Vis irreducible.
(2)The set{M(1X+(m,n)) : (m,n)∈Z2}generates the von Neumann algebra L∞(Y,ν).
Suppose that Vis irreducible. Let µ∈ Me,β(Yu)be such that Vµis unitarily equivalent to V.
Then, forλ∈[0,1],µis of typeIIIλif and only if νis of typeIIIλ.
Proof.It can be proved as in Prop. 3.27 that U:={U(m,n)}(m,n)∈Z2is the minimal uni-
tary dilation of V. Note that for ( m,n)∈Z2, the orthogonal projection onto U(m,n)His
M(1X+(m,n)). LetD:={M(1X+(m,n)) : (m,n)∈Z2}′′. Let
N: ={V(m,n),V∗
(m,n): (m,n)∈N2}′
M: =D′∩{U(m,n): (m,n)∈Z2}′.
We leave it to the reader to check that the map M∋T→T|H∈Nis a∗-algebra isomorphism.
Thus,Vis irreducible if and only if M=C.
Suppose that (2) holds. Then, D′=L∞(Y,ν). The fact that M=Cfollows from the
ergodicity of ν. This completes the proof of the implication (2) = ⇒(1).
Conversely, assume that (1) holds. Then, M=C. Denote the σ-algebra of YbyB, and let
Fbe theσ-algebra generated by {X+(m,n) : (m,n)∈Z2}. Then,L2(Yu,F,ν) is a non-zero
closed subspace of L2(Y,B,ν) that is invariant under {U(m,n): (m,n)∈Z2}andD. The fact
thatM=Cimplies that L2(Y,F,ν) =L2(Y,B,ν).
LetE∈ Bbe given. For n≥1, letEn:=E∩(X−(n,n)). Then, 1 Enր1E. Letn≥1
be given. Note that Enhas ﬁnite measure as ν(X)<∞and asνise−βc-conformal. Then,
1En∈L2(Y,B,ν). SinceL2(Y,B,ν) =L2(Y,F,ν), there exists a F-measurable function fn
such that 1 En=fna.e. Sincefn= 1Ena.e.,fn∈L∞(Y,F,ν). This implies that M(1En) =
M(fn)∈M(L∞(Y,F,ν)) =D. Since 1 Enր1E, it follows that M(1E)∈ D. Consequently,
D=L∞(Y,B,ν). This completes the proof of the implication (1) = ⇒(2).
Suppose that Vis irreducible. Thanks to the equivalence between (1) and (2 ), we have
D=L∞(Y,ν). The ﬁnal assertion now follows from Prop. 3.23.
Proposition 5.2. Letβ >0, and letλ:=e−β. There exists a pure (Z2,N2)-space(Y,X)and
ane−βc-conformal measure νonYsuch that
(1)νis ergodic,
(2)the set{M(1X+(m,n)) : (m,n)∈Z2}generatesL∞(Y,ν),ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT 41
(3) 0<ν(X)<∞, and
(4)the von Neumann algebra L∞(Y)⋊Z2is a factor of type IIIλ.
Here,M:L∞(Y,ν)→B(L2(Y,ν))is the multiplication representation.
Proof.LetD:={(x1,x2,···) :xn∈ {0,1}}be the group of dyadic integers. Remove from
Dthe eventually constant sequences, and denote the resultin g set again by D. LetSbe the
transformation on Dthat corresponds to addition by 1.
Letp∈(0,1
2) be such that1−p
p=eβ. Letm:=⊗∞
k=1pkbe the product measure, where
pk({0}) = 1−p, andpk({1}) =p. Then,
d(m◦S)
dm=eβφ,
whereφ:D →Zis deﬁned by
φ(x) := min{n≥1 :xn= 0}−2.
LetY:=D ×Z, and letX:=D ×N. Deﬁne a Z2-action onYby setting
(x,k)+e1: = (x,k+1),
(x,k)+e2: = (Sx,φ(x)+k+1).
Sinceφ≥ −1, it follows that X+N2⊂X. Moreover, ( Y,X) is a pure ( Z2,N2)-space. Let νbe
the measure on Ydeﬁned bydν=e−βkdmdk, wheredkis the counting measure on Z. Clearly,
νise−βc-conformal, and ν(X)∈(0,∞).
The ergodicity of νfollows from that of m. By Prop. 4.4 of [3], it follows that {1X+(m,n):
(m,n)∈Z2}separates points of Y. Thanks to Thm. 3.3.5 of [4], it follows that the translates
ofXgenerate the σ-algebra of Y. Now (2) follows.
Fork≥0, letEk:={x∈X:φ(x) + 1 =k}, and setpk= 1Ek∈L∞(D). LetUbe the
bilateral shift on ℓ2(Z). LetS:L∞(D)→L∞(D) be deﬁned by
Sf(x) =f(S−1x).
WriteL∞(Y)⋊Z2as an iterated crossed product ( L∞(Y)⋊Ze1)⋊Ze2. Note that L∞(Y)∼=
L∞(D)⊗ℓ∞(Z), and the action of e1is by translation by 1 on the second factor. Thus,
L∞(Y)⋊Ze1∼=L∞(D)⊗B(ℓ2(Z)).
OnceL∞(Y)⋊Ze2is identiﬁed with L∞(D)⊗B(ℓ2(Z)), the action of e2on the von Neumann
algebraL∞(D)⊗B(ℓ2(Z)) is given by Ad(R)◦(S⊗1), where the unitary Ris given by
R:=/summationtext∞
k=0pk⊗Uk. Thus, the automorphism corresponding to the e2-action is outer conjugate
to the automorphism S⊗1. Therefore,
L∞(Y)⋊Z2∼=(L∞(D)⋊SZ)⊗B(ℓ2(Z)).
It is well known that L∞(D)⋊SZis a typeIIIλfactor. Thus, L∞(Y)⋊ Z2is a typeIIIλ
factor. The proof is complete. ✷42 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
Proposition 5.3. Letβ >0,nbe a positive integer, and let λ:=e−βn. Then, there exists a
pure(Z2,N2)-space(Y,X)and ane−βc-conformal measure µonYsuch that
(1)the translates of 1XgenerateL∞(Y,µ),
(2) 0<µ(X)<∞, and
(3)the von Neumann algebra L∞(Y,µ)⋊Z2is a factor of type IIIλ.
Proof.We apply Prop. 5.2 for the value nβto get hold of a space ( Y0,X0) with a conformal
measure. Thus, let( Y0,X0)beaapure( Z2,N2)-space, andlet νbeane−βnc-conformal measure
onY0such that
(1) the translates of 1 X0generateL∞(Y0,ν),
(2) 0<ν(X0)<∞, and
(3) the von Neumann algebra L∞(Y0)⋊Z2is a factor of type IIIλ.
Denote the subgroup nZ2ofZ2byH. AsHis isomorphic to Z2, we can treat Y0as aH-space.
We induce the action of HonY0to get aZ2-spaceY.
LetI:={0,1,2,···,n−1}. LetY:=Y0×I×I. Deﬁne a Z2-action onYas follows:
(y,p,q)+e1:=

(y,p+1,q) ifp<n−1,
(y+e1,0,q) ifp=n−1,
and
(y,p,q)+e2:=

(y,p,q+1) ifq<n−1,
(y+e2,p,0) ifq=n−1.
SetX:=X0×I×I. It is clear that X+N2⊂X. Note that for r,s≥0, we haveX+(nr,ns) =
(X0+(r,s))×I×I. Thus,
/intersectiondisplay
(r,s)∈N2(X+(nr,ns)) =/parenleftBig/intersectiondisplay
(r,s)∈N2X0+(r,s)/parenrightBig
×I×I=∅.
Also, forr,s≥0,X−(nr,ns) = (X0−(r,s))×I×I. Consequently,
/uniondisplay
(r,s)∈N2(X−(nr,ns)) =/parenleftBig/uniondisplay
(r,s)∈N2X0−(r,s)/parenrightBig
×I×I=Y0×I×I.
Thus, (Y,X) is a pure ( Z2,N2)-space. Deﬁne a measure µonYby setting
dµ:=e−βpe−βqdνdpdq.
Here,dpdqis the counting measure on I×I. Using the fact that νise−βnc-conformal, it is
routine to check that µise−βc-conformal. We leave this veriﬁcation to the reader. Clearl y,
µ(X)∈(0,∞).ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT 43
LetU:={U(r,s)}(r,s)∈Z2be the Koopman representation of Z2onL2(Y0,ν). Denote the
Hilbert space L2(X0,ν) byH, and letV:={V(r,s)}(r,s)∈N2be the isometric representation of
N2onHdeﬁned by
V(r,s):=U(r,s)|H.
Let/tildewideU:={/tildewideU(r,s)}(r,s)∈Z2be the Koopman representation of Z2onL2(Y,µ). Denote the
Hilbert space L2(X,µ) by/tildewideH, and let /tildewideV:={/tildewideV(r,s)}(r,s)∈N2be the isometric representation on
/tildewideHdeﬁned by
/tildewideV(r,s):=/tildewideU(r,s)|/tildewideH.
Let{δp:p= 0,1,2,···,n−1}be the standard orthonormal basis for ℓ2(I). LetU:ℓ2(I)→
ℓ2(I) be the unitary operator deﬁned by
U(δp) :=

δp+1ifp<n−1,
δ0ifp=n−1.
LetPbe the orthogonal projection onto Cδn−1. Note that we can identify /tildewideHwithH⊗ℓ2(I)⊗
ℓ2(I). Then,
/tildewideV(1,0)=V(1,0)⊗UP⊗1+1⊗U(1−P)⊗1
/tildewideV(0,1)=V(0,1)⊗1⊗UP+1⊗1⊗U(1−P).
We claim that /tildewideVis irreducible. Let Mbe the von Neumann algebra generated by {/tildewideV(r,s):
(r,s)∈N2}. SupposeT∈M′. Note that for ( r,s)∈N2,
/tildewideV(nr,ns)=V(r,s)⊗1⊗1.
SinceVis irreducible, it follows that there exists R∈B(ℓ2(I)⊗ℓ2(I)) such that T= 1⊗R.
The fact that T/tildewideV(1,0)=/tildewideV(1,0)Timplies that
V(1,0)⊗R(UP⊗1)+1⊗R(U(1−P)⊗1) =V(1,0)⊗(UP⊗1)R+1⊗(U(1−P)⊗1)R.
SinceV(1,0)is an isometry which is not a unitary (as it has an eigenvalue o f modulus strictly
less than one), we have
R(UP⊗1) = (UP⊗1)R
R(U(1−P)⊗1) = (U(1−P)⊗1)R.
Routine simpliﬁcations of the above equations imply that Rcommutes with U⊗1 andP⊗1.
Clearly,{U⊗1,P⊗1}generatesB(ℓ2(I))⊗1. Thus,R∈1⊗B(ℓ2(I)).
Similarly, the fact that T/tildewideV(0,1)=/tildewideV(0,1)Tleads to the conclusion that Rcommutes with 1 ⊗U
and 1⊗P. Hence,R∈B(ℓ2(I))⊗1. Consequently, Ris a scalar multiple of the identity.
Hence,/tildewideVis irreducible. It follows from Prop. 5.1 that the translate s of 1XgenerateL∞(Y,µ).44 ON THE KMS STATES FOR THE BERNOULLI SHIFT
Denote the subgroup nZ2ofZ2byH, and letG:=Z2. IdentifyHwithZ2via the map
H∋(r,s)→1
n(r,s)∈Z2. OnceHis identiﬁed with Z2, we can view Y0as aH-space. The
G-spaceYis clearly the one obtained by inducing the H-spaceY0, i.e.
Y:=Y0×HG.
It can be proved that L∞(Y0×HG)⋊G∼=(L∞(Y0)⋊H)⊗B(ℓ2(G/H)). Hence, as L∞(Y0)⋊H
is a factor of type IIIλ,L∞(Y)⋊Gis a factor of type IIIλ. ✷
Theorem 1.2 is now a consequence of Prop. 5.3, Prop. 5.1, Prop . 4.1, Prop. 2.1 and Prop.
