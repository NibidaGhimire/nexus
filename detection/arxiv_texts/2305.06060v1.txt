Abstract
For an additive polynomial and a positive integer, we deﬁne a n irreducible
smooth representation of a Weil group of a non-archimedean l ocal ﬁeld. We study
several invariants of this representation. We deduce a nece ssary and suﬃcient
condition for it to be primitive.
1 Introduction
Letpbe a prime number and qa power of it. An additive polynomial R(x) overFq
is a one-variable polynomial with coeﬃcients in Fqsuch thatR(x+y) =R(x)+R(y).
It is known that R(x) has the form/summationtexte
i=0aixpi(ae/\e}atio\slash= 0) with an integer e≥0. LetF
be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld with residue ﬁeld Fq. We take a separable closure F
ofF. LetWFbe the Weil group of F/F. LetvF(·) denote the normalized valuation
onF. We take a prime number ℓ/\e}atio\slash=p. For a non-trivial character ψ:Fp→Q×
ℓ, a
non-zero additive polynomial R(x) overFqand a positive integer mwhich is prime to p,
we deﬁne an irreducible smooth WF-representation τψ,R,moverQℓof degreepeifvF(p)
is suﬃciently large. This is unconditional if Fhas positive characteristic. The integer
mis related to the Swan conductor exponent of τψ,R,m. Asmvaries, the isomorphism
class ofτψ,R,mvaries.
LetCRdenote the algebraic aﬃne curve deﬁned by ap−a=xR(x) inA2
Fq=
SpecFq[a,x]. This curve isstudied in[6] and [1] indetail. For example, the smoothco m-
pactiﬁcation of CRis proved to be supersingular if ( p,e)/\e}atio\slash= (2,0). The automorphism
group ofCRcontains a semidirect product QRof a cyclic group and an extra-special
p-group ((2.5)). Let Fbe an algebraic closure of Fq. Then a semidirect group QR⋊Z
acts on the base change CR,F:=CR×FqFas endomorphisms, where 1 ∈Zacts onCR,F
as the Frobenius endomorphism over Fq. The center Z(QR) ofQRis identiﬁed with Fp,
which acts on CRasa/ma√sto→a+ζforζ∈Fp. LetH1
c(CR,F,Qℓ) be the ﬁrst´ etalecohomology
group ofCR,Fwith compact support. Each element of Z(QR) is ﬁxed by the action of Z
onQR. Thus itsψ-isotypic part H1
c(CR,F,Qℓ)[ψ] is regarded as a QR⋊Z-representation.
We construct a concrete Galois extension over Fwhose Weil group is isomorphic to
a subgroup of QR⋊Zassociated to the integer m(Deﬁnition 3.1 and (3.8)). Namely
we will deﬁne a homomorphism Θ R,m:WF→QR⋊Zin (3.12). As a result, we deﬁne
τψ,R,mto be the composite
WFΘR,m− −− →QR⋊Z→AutQℓ(H1
c(CR,F,Qℓ)[ψ]).

1This is a smooth irreducible representation of WFof degreepe.
We state our motivation and reason why we introduce and study τψ,R,m. It is known
that the reductions of concentric aﬃnoids in the Lubin–Tate curve ﬁt into this type of
curvesCRwith special R. For example, see [16] and [17]. When Ris a monomial and
m= 1, the representation τψ,R,mis studied in [9] and [10] in detail. In these papers,
the reduction of a certain aﬃnoid in the Lubin–Tate space is related t oCRin some
sense and the supercuspidal representation πof GLpe(F) which corresponds to τψ,R,m
under the local Langlands correspondence explicitly. The homomor phism Θ R,1with
R(x) =xpe(e∈Z≥1) does appear in the work [9]. An irreducible representation of a
group is said to be primitive if it is not isomorphic to an induction of any re presentation
of a proper subgroup. The representation τψ,R,min [9] and [10] is primitive and this
property makes it complicated to describe πin a view point of type theory. It is an
interesting problem to do the same thing for general τψ,R,m. In this direction, it would
be valuable to know when τψ,R,mis primitive. We expect that another CRwill be related
to concentric aﬃnoids in the Lubin–Tate spaces as in [9].
We brieﬂy explain the content of each section. In §2, we state several things on the
curvesCRand the extra-special p-subgroups contained in the automorphism groups of
the curves.
In§3.1 and §3.2, we construct the Galois extension mentioned above and deﬁne
τψ,R,m. LetdR:= gcd{pi+1|ai/\e}atio\slash= 0}. We show that the Swan conductor exponent of
τψ,R,mequalsm(pe+1)/dR(Corollary 3.15). In §3.3, we study primitivity of τψ,R,m. In
particular, we write down a necessary and suﬃcient condition for τψ,R,mto be primitive.
By this, we give examples such that τψ,R,mis primitive (Example 3.29). The necessary
and suﬃcient condition is that a symplectic module ( VR,ωR) associated to τψ,R,mis
completely anisotropic (Corollary 3.28). If Ris a monomial, ( VR,ωR) is studied in
§3.4 in more detail. In Proposition 3.44, a primary module in the sense of [ 11,§9] is
constructed geometrically by using the K¨ unneth formula.
Our aim in §4 is to show the following theorem.
Theorem 1.1. Assumep/\e}atio\slash= 2. The following two conditions are equivalent.
(1)There exists a non-trivial ﬁnite ´ etale morphism
CR→CR1; (a,x)/ma√sto→(a−∆(x),r(x)),
where∆(x)∈Fq[x]andr(x),R1(x)are additive polynomials over Fqsuch that
dR,m|dR1andr(αx) =αr(x)for anyα∈µdR,m.
(2)TheWF-representation τψ,R,mis imprimitive.
Ifτψ,R,mis imprimitive, it is written as a form of an induced representation of a
certain explicit WF′-representation τ′
ψ,R1,massociated to a ﬁnite extension F′/F. The
proof of the above theorem depends on several geometric prope rties ofCRdeveloped in
[6] and [1]. See the beginning of §4 for more details.
Notation
Letkbe a ﬁeld. Let µ(k) denote the set of all roots of unity in k. For a positive integer
r, letµr(k) :={x∈k|xr= 1}.
2Forapositiveinteger i, letAi
kandPi

space overk, respectively. For a scheme Xoverkand a ﬁeld extension l/k, letXldenote
the base change of Xtol. For a closed subset Zof a variety X, we regard Zas a closed
subscheme with reduced scheme structure.
Throughout this paper, we set q:=pfwith a positive integer f. For a positive
integeri, we simply write Nr qi/qand Trqi/qfor the norm map and the trace map from
FqitoFq, respectively.
LetXbe a scheme over Fq, letFq:X→Xbe theq-th power Frobenius endomor-
phism. Let Fbe an algebraic closure of Fq. Let Fr q:XF→XFbe the base change of
Fq. This endomorphism Fr qis called the Frobenius endomorphism of XoverFq.
For a Galois extension l/k, let Gal(l/k) denote the Galois group of the extension.
2 Extra-special p-groups and aﬃne curves
Deﬁnition 2.1. Letkbeaﬁeld. Apolynomial f(x)∈k[x]iscalledadditiveif f(x+y) =
f(x)+f(y). Let Akbe the set of all additive polynomials with coeﬃcients in k.
Letpbe a prime number. We simply AqforAFq. LetR(x) :=/summationtexte
i=0aixpi∈Aqwith
e∈Z≥0andae/\e}atio\slash= 0. Let
ER(x) :=R(x)pe+e/summationdisplay
i=0(aix)pe−i∈Aq. (2.1)
We always assume
(p,e)/\e}atio\slash= (2,0). (2.2)
We simply write µrforµr(F) for a positive integer r. Let
dR:= gcd{pi+1|ai/\e}atio\slash= 0}.
Ifai/\e}atio\slash= 0, we have αpi=α−1andαpe−i=αforα∈µdR. Hence we have
αR(αx) =R(x), ER(αx) =αER(x) forα∈µdR. (2.3)
Let
fR(x,y) :=−e−1/summationdisplay
i=0/parenleftBigge−i−1/summationdisplay
j=0(aixpiy)pj+(xR(y))pi/parenrightBigg
∈Fq[x,y].
This is linear with respect to xandy. By (2.3), we have
fR(αx,αy) =fR(x,y) forα∈µdR. (2.4)
Lemma 2.2. We havefR(x,y)p−fR(x,y) =−xpeER(y)+xR(y)+yR(x).In particular,
ifER(y) = 0, we havefR(x,y)p−fR(x,y) =xR(y)+yR(x).
Proof.The former equality follows from
fR(x,y)p−fR(x,y) =xR(y)−(xR(y))pe+e−1/summationdisplay
i=0(aixpiy−(aixpiy)pe−i)
=−xpeER(y)+xR(y)+yR(x).
3Deﬁnition 2.3. (1) LetVR:={β∈F|ER(β) = 0},which is a (2 e)-dimensional
Fp-vector space.
(2) Let
QR:=/braceleftbig
(α,β,γ)∈F3|α∈µdR, β∈VR, γp−γ=βR(β)/bracerightbig
be the group whose group law is given by
(α1,β1,γ1)·(α2,β2,γ2) := (α1α2,β1+α1β2,γ1+γ2+fR(β1,α1β2)).
This is well-deﬁned according to (2.3) and Lemma 2.2.
(3) LetHR:={(α,β,γ)∈QR|α= 1},which is a normal subgroup of QR.
Ife= 0, we have p/\e}atio\slash= 2 by (2.2). We have HR=Fp⊂QR=µ2×Fpife= 0.
For a group Gand elements g,g′∈G, let [g,g′] :=gg′g−1g′−1.
Lemma 2.4. Forg= (1,β,γ), g′= (1,β′,γ′)∈HR, we have [g,g′] = (1,0,fR(β,β′)−
fR(β′,β)). In particular, we have fR(β,β′)−fR(β′,β)∈Fp.
Proof.This is directly checked. We omit the details.
For a group G, letZ(G) denote its center and [ G,G] the commutator subgroup of
G.
Deﬁnition 2.5. A non-abelian p-groupGis called an extra-special p-groupif [G,G] =
Z(G) and|Z(G)|=p.
Lemma 2.6. Assumee≥1.
(1)The group HRis non-abelian. We have Z(HR) =Z(QR) ={(1,0,γ)|γ∈Fp}.
The quotient HR/Z(HR)is isomorphic to VR.
(2)ThegroupHRis anextra-special p-group. The pairing ωR:VR×VR→Fp; (β,β′)/ma√sto→
fR(β,β′)−fR(β′,β)is a non-degenerate symplectic form.
Proof.We show (1). Let Xβ:={x∈F|fR(β,x) =fR(x,β)}forβ∈VR. ThenXβis
anFp-vector space of dimension 2 e−1 ifβ/\e}atio\slash= 0. Since VRhas dimension 2 e, we have
VR/n⋊tsubseteqlXβforβ∈VR\ {0}. This implies that HRis non-abelian according to Lemma
2.4.
Clearly we have Z:={(1,0,γ)|γ∈Fp} ⊂Z(QR)⊂Z(HR). It suﬃces to show
Z(HR)⊂Z. Let (1,β,γ)∈Z(HR). We have VR⊂Xβby Lemma 2.4. This implies
β= 0. Hence we obtain Z(HR)⊂Z. The last claim is easily veriﬁed.
We show (2). By Lemma 2.4, we have [ HR,HR]⊂Z(HR). SinceHRis non-abelian,
[HR,HR] is non-trivial. Hence we have [ HR,HR] =Z(HR) by|Z(HR)|=p. HenceHRis
extra-special. Assume ωR(β,β′) = 0for any β′∈VR. Wetake anelement (1 ,β,γ)∈HR.
By Lemma 2.4, we have (1 ,β,γ)∈Z(HR). Hence we have β= 0 by (1).
Deﬁnition 2.7. (1) LetCRbe the aﬃne curve over Fqdeﬁned byap−a=xR(x).
(2) LetQRact onCR,Fby
(a,x)·(α,β,γ) =/parenleftbig
a+fR(x,β)+γ,α−1(x+β)/parenrightbig
, (2.5)
for (a,x)∈CR,Fand (α,β,γ)∈QR. This is well-deﬁned by (2.3) and Lemma 2.2.
4The curveCRis studied in [6] and [1].
We take a prime number ℓ/\e}atio\slash=p. For a ﬁnite abelian group A, letA∨denote the
character group Hom Z(A,Q×
ℓ). For a representation MofAoverQℓandχ∈A∨, let
M[χ] denote the χ-isotypic part of M.
According to Lemma 2.6(1), we identify a character ψ∈F∨
pwith a character of
Z(HR).
Lemma 2.8. Letψ∈F∨
p\{1}.
(1)LetW⊂VRbe anFp-subspace of dimension e, which is totally isotropic with
respect toωR. LetW′⊂HRbe the inverse image of Wby the natural map
HR→VR; (1,β,γ)/ma√sto→β. Letξ∈W′∨be an extension of ψ∈Z(HR)∨. Let
ρψ:= IndHR
W′ξ. Thenρψis a unique (up to isomorphism) irreducible representation
ofHRcontainingψ. In particular, ρψ|Z(HR)is a multiple of ψ.
(2)Theψ-isotypic part H1
c(CR,F,Qℓ)[ψ]is isomorphic to ρψasHR-representations.
Proof.By Lemma 2.6(2) and [8, 16.14(2) Satz], the claim (1) follows. By [16, Re mark
3.29], we have dim H1
c(CR,F,Qℓ)[ψ] =pe. Hence the claim (2) follows from (1).
Therepresentation ρψinducesaprojectiverepresentation ¯ ρ:HR/Z(HR)→PGLpe(Qℓ).
Lemma 2.9. The map ¯ρis injective.
Proof.As in the proof of [14, Theorem 6], we have Tr ρψ(x) = 0 forx∈HR\Z(HR).
Assume ¯ρ(xZ(HR)) = 1 forx∈HR. Thenρψ(x) is a non-zero scalar matrix. Hence
Trρψ(x)/\e}atio\slash= 0. This implies x∈Z(HR).
LetZ∋1 act onH1
c(CR,F,Qℓ) by the pull-back Fr∗
q. LetZ∋1 act onQRby
(α,β,γ)/ma√sto→(αq−1,βq−1,γq−1). The semidirect product QR⋊Zacts onH1
c(CR,F,Qℓ)[ψ].
LetCRdenote the smooth compactiﬁcation of CR.
Proposition 2.10. The projective curve CRis supersingular. In particular, this curve
has positive genus. The natural map H1
c(CR,F,Qℓ)→H1(CR,F,Qℓ)is an isomorphism.
Proof.The former claim is shown in [6, Theorems (9.4) and (13.7)] ( [1, Propos ition
8.5]). The last claim follows from [16, Lemmas 3.27 and 3.28(3)].
3 Local Galois representation
In this section, we deﬁne an irreducible smooth WF-representation τψ,R,mand determine
several invariants associated to it. In §3.2.2, we determine the Swan conductor exponent
ofτψ,R,m. In§3.3, we determine the symplectic module associated to τψ,R,m, and give
a necessary and suﬃcient condition for τψ,R,mto be primitive. As a result, we obtain
several examplessuchthat τψ,R,misprimitive. If Risamonomial, wecalculateinvariants
of the root system corresponding to ( VR,ωR) deﬁned in [11] ( Lemma 3.36).
53.1 Galois extension
For a valued ﬁeld K, letOKdenote the valuation ring of K.
LetFbe a non-archimedean local ﬁeld. Let Fbe a separable closure of F. Let
/hatwideFdenote the completion of F. Letv(·) denote the unique valuation on/hatwideFsuch that
v(̟) = 1 for a uniformizer ̟ofF, which we now ﬁx. We simply write OforO/hatwideF. Let
pbe the maximal ideal of O.
Letqbe the cardinality of the residue ﬁeld of OF.
We takeR(x) =/summationtexte
i=0aixpi∈Aq. For an element a∈Fq, let/tildewidea∈µ(F)∪{0}be its
Teichm¨ uller lift. Let
/tildewideR(x) :=e/summationdisplay
i=0/tildewideaixpi,/tildewideER(x) :=/tildewideR(x)pe+e/summationdisplay
i=0(/tildewideaix)pe−i∈ OF[x].
Similarly as (2.3), we have
α/tildewideR(αx) =/tildewideR(x),/tildewideER(αx) =α/tildewideER(x) forα∈µdR(F). (3.1)
Deﬁnition 3.1. Letmbe a positive integer prime to p. LetαR,̟,βR,m,̟,γR,m,̟∈F
be elements such that
αdR
R,̟=̟,/tildewideER(βR,m,̟) =α−m
R,̟, γp
R,m,̟−γR,m,̟=βR,m,̟/tildewideR(βR,m,̟).
For simplicity, we write αR,βR,m,γR,mforαR,̟,βR,m,̟,γR,m,̟, respectively.
Remark 3.2. By deg/tildewideER(x) =p2eand deg/tildewideR(x) =pe, we have
v(αR) =1
dR, v(βR,m) =−m
p2edR, v(γR,m) =−m(pe+1)
p2e+1dR.
The integer mcontrols the depth of ramiﬁcation of the resulting ﬁeld extension
F(αR,βR,m,γR,m)/F. We will understand this later in §3.2.2.
Let
/tildewidef(x,y) :=−e−1/summationdisplay
i=0/parenleftBigge−i−1/summationdisplay
j=0(/tildewideajxpiy)pj+(x/tildewideR(y))pi/parenrightBigg
.
Letp[x] :=pO[x] andp[x,y] :=pO[x,y]. We assume that
βpe
R,m(/tildewideER(βR,m+x)−/tildewideER(βR,m)−/tildewideER(x)), βR,m(/tildewideR(βR,m+x)−/tildewideR(βR,m)−/tildewideR(x)),
/tildewidef(βR,m,x)p−/tildewidef(βR,m,x)+βpe
R,m/tildewideER(x)−x/tildewideR(βR,m)−βR,m/tildewideR(x) are contained in p[x] and
(γR,m+/tildewidef(βR,m,y)+x)p−γp
R,m−/tildewidef(βR,m,y)p−xp∈p[x,y].
(3.2)
Forr∈Q≥0andf,g∈F, we writef≡gmodr+ ifv(f−g)> r. For a local ﬁeld
Kcontained in F, letWKbe the Weil group of F/K. Forσ∈WK, letnσ∈Zbe the
integer such that σ(x)≡xq−nσmod 0+ for x∈ OF. LetvK(·) denote the normalized
valuation on K.
Deﬁnition 3.3. Forσ∈WF, we set
aR,σ:=σ(αR)/αR∈µdR(F), bR,σ:=am
R,σσ(βR,m)−βR,m,
cR,σ:=σ(γR,m)−γR,m−/tildewidef(βR,m,bR,σ).(3.3)
In the following, we simply write aσ,bσ,cσforaR,σ,bR,σ,cR,σ, respectively.
6For an element x∈ O, let ¯xdenote the image of xby the map O → O/p. In
the following proofs, for simplicity, we often write α,βandγforαR,βR,mandγR,m,
respectively.
Lemma 3.4. We havebσ,cσ∈ O,ER(¯bσ) = 0and¯cp
σ−¯cσ=¯bσR(¯bσ).
Proof.Using (3.1), the equality /tildewideER(β) =α−min Deﬁnition 3.1 and (3.3),
/tildewideER(β+bσ) =/tildewideER(am
σσ(β)) =am
σ/tildewideER(σ(β)) =am
σσ(α)−m=α−m=/tildewideER(β).
Usingv(β)<0 in Remark 3.2 and (3.2), we have ∆( x) :=/tildewideER(β+x)−/tildewideER(β)−
/tildewideER(x)∈p[x]. By letting x=bσand applying the previous relationship, we deduce that
/tildewideER(bσ)+∆(bσ) = 0. Hence bσ∈ OandER(¯bσ) = 0.
By (3.2), we have
β/tildewideR(β+bσ)≡β/tildewideR(β)+β/tildewideR(bσ),/tildewidef(β,bσ)p−/tildewidef(β,bσ)≡bσ/tildewideR(β)+β/tildewideR(bσ) mod 0+ .(3.4)
Substituting y=bσ∈ Oto (3.2), we obtain
∆1(x) := (γ+/tildewidef(β,bσ)+x)p−γp−/tildewidef(β,bσ)p−xp∈p[x].
We haveσ(β)/tildewideR(σ(β)) = (β+bσ)/tildewideR(β+bσ) by substituting (3.3) and using (3.1). By
multiplying the ﬁrst congruence in (3.4) by bσβ−1, we obtain bσ/tildewideR(β+bσ)≡bσ/tildewideR(β)+
bσ/tildewideR(bσ) mod 0+. Hence, we compute
σ(γ)p−σ(γ) =σ(β)/tildewideR(σ(β)) = (β+bσ)/tildewideR(β+bσ)
≡β/tildewideR(β)+bσ/tildewideR(β)+β/tildewideR(bσ)+bσ/tildewideR(bσ)
≡γp−γ+/tildewidef(β,bσ)p−/tildewidef(β,bσ)+bσ/tildewideR(bσ)
≡σ(γ)p−σ(γ)−(cp
σ−cσ+∆1(cσ))+bσ/tildewideR(bσ) mod 0+ ,
where we have used (3.3) for the last congruence. Hence we obtain cp
σ−cσ+∆1(cσ)≡
bσ/tildewideR(bσ) mod 0+. By bσ∈ O, we havecσ∈ Oand ¯cp
σ−¯cσ=¯bσR(¯bσ).
Assume that
(x+βR,m)pi−xpi−βpi
R,m∈p[x] for 1≤i≤e−1,
/tildewidef(βR,m,x+y)−/tildewidef(βR,m,x)−/tildewidef(βR,m,y)∈p[x,y],(3.5)
Let
ΘR,m,̟:WF→QR⋊Z;σ/ma√sto→((¯am
σ,¯bσ,¯cσ),nσ). (3.6)
Lemma 3.5. The map ΘR,m,̟is a homomorphism.
Proof.Letσ,σ′∈WF. Recall that σ(x)≡xq−nσmod 0+ for x∈ OF. Using Deﬁnition
2.3(2), we reduce to checking that
¯aσσ′= ¯aσ¯aq−nσ
σ′,¯bσσ′= ¯am
σ¯bq−nσ
σ′+¯bσ,¯cσσ′= ¯cσ+¯cq−nσ
σ′+fR(¯bσ,¯am
σ¯b−nσ
σ′).(3.7)
7We easily check that aσσ′=σ(aσ′)aσandbσσ′=am
σσ(bσ′)+bσ. Hence the ﬁrst equalities
in (3.7) follow. We compute
cσσ′=cσ+σ(cσ′)+σ(/tildewidef(β,bσ′))+/tildewidef(β,bσ)−/tildewidef(β,bσσ′)
≡cσ+σ(cσ′)+σ(/tildewidef(β,bσ′))−/tildewidef(β,am
σσ(bσ′)) mod 0+ ,
where we use the second condition in (3.5) for the second congruen ce. We have
σ(/tildewidef(β,bσ′)) =−e−1/summationdisplay
i=0e−i−1/summationdisplay
j=0(/tildewideajσ(bσ′)σ(β)pi)pj−e−1/summationdisplay
i=0(σ(β)/tildewideR(σ(bσ′)))pi
≡/tildewidef(bσ,am
σσ(bσ′))+/tildewidef(β,am
σσ(bσ′)) mod 0+ ,
where we substitute σ(β) =a−m
σ(β+bσ), (3.5) and (3.1) for the second congruence. The
last equality in (3.7) follows from /tildewidef(bσ,amσσ(bσ′)) =fR(¯bσ,¯am
σ¯bq−nσ
σ′), since/tildewidef(x,y) is a
lift offR(x,y) toOF[x,y].
Lemma 3.6. Ifv(p)is large enough, the conditions (3.2)and(3.5)are satisﬁed.
Proof.There exists s∈Z≥1such that the coeﬃcients of all polynomials in (3.2) and
(3.5) have the form: p·βs
R,m·awitha∈ OFby Remark 3.2. Since the valuation of
v(βR,m) is independent of F, the claim follows.
In the sequel, we assume that the conditions (3.2) and (3.5) are sat isﬁed. Let Fur
denote the maximal unramiﬁed extension of FinF.
Lemma 3.7. The extension Fur(αm
R,βR,m,γR,m)/Fis Galois.
Proof.LetL0:=Fur(αm,β,γ) andL:=/hatwideL0be the completion of L0. Letσ∈GF.
We note that aσ∈µdR(F)⊂Furbyp∤dR. Henceσ(αm) =am
σαm∈L0. We show
σ(β),σ(γ)∈L0. It suﬃces to prove
bσ,cσ∈L0,
since
σ(β) =bσ+β
amσ, σ(γ) =γ+cσ+/tildewidef(β,bσ)
by(3.3). AsintheproofofLemma3.4,wehave( /tildewideER+∆)(bσ) = 0,E(x) := (/tildewideER+∆)(x)∈
OL0[x] and degE(x) =p2e. The equation E(x)≡0 mod 0+ has p2ediﬀerent roots.
Hence by Hensel’s lemma, E(x) = 0 has p2ediﬀerent roots in OL. Hence we have
bσ∈L∩F=L0. As in the proof of Lemma 3.4, we have
f(cσ) :=cp
σ−cσ+∆1(cσ)−y= 0 withy∈ OL0,
wheref(x)∈ OL0[x] with degf(x) =p. We havey≡bσ/tildewideR(bσ) mod 0+. The equation
f(x)≡xp−x−y≡xp−x−bσ/tildewideR(bσ)≡0 mod 0+ has pdiﬀerent roots. By Hensel’s
lemma,f(x) = 0 haspdiﬀerent roots in OL. Hence we have cσ∈L∩F=L0.
Deﬁnition 3.8. Let
dR,m:=dR
gcd(dR,m), QR,m:={(α,β,γ)∈QR|α∈µdR,m}.
8Lemma 3.9. We have the isomorphism
W(Fur(αm
R,βR,m,γR,m)/F)∼− →QR,m⋊Z;σ/ma√sto→((¯am
σ,¯bσ,¯cσ),nσ).(3.8)
Proof.We use the notation in the proof of Lemma 3.4. Let
I:= Gal(Fur(αm,β,γ)/Fur)
and Θ:I→QR,mbe the restriction of (3.8). First, we show that Θ is injective. Assum e
Θ(σ) = 1 forσ∈I. We will show σ= 1. By the assumption, ¯ am
σ= 1,¯bσ= 0 and
¯cσ= 0. We have a natural isomorphism µr(F)∼− →µrfor an integer rprime top.
By ¯am
σ= 1 andaσ∈µdR(F) in (3.3), we have am
σ= 1 andσ(αm) =αm. We recall
the equality/tildewideER(bσ) + ∆(bσ) = 0 in the proof of Lemma 3.4, where ∆( x)∈p[x] has
no constant coeﬃcient. We have v(bσ)>0 by¯bσ= 0. Assume that bσ/\e}atio\slash= 0. Then
v(bσ) =v(/tildewideER(bσ)+∆(bσ)) byE′
R(0)/\e}atio\slash= 0 andv(bσ)>0. This implies that v(bσ) =∞,
which is a contradiction. Hence bσ= 0 andσ(β) =β. By the last condition in (3.2)
withy= 0,
Λ(x) := (γ+x)p−γp−xp∈p[x].
We haveσ(γ)p−σ(γ) =γp−γby Deﬁnition 3.1. Hence ( γ+cσ)p−γp=cσand
cp
σ+ Λ(cσ) =cσ. Since Λ(x)∈p[x] has no constant coeﬃcient, if 0 < v(cσ)<∞, we
havev(cp
σ+Λ(cσ))>v(cσ), which can not occur. Hence cσ= 0 andσ(γ) =γ. We obtain
σ= 1. Hence Θ is injective. We easily check that Fur(αm,β,γ)/Furis a totally ramiﬁed
extension of degree dR,mp2e+1. Hence Θ is an isomorphism. By the snake lemma, (3.8)
is an isomorphism.
3.2 Galois representations associated to additive polynom ials
3.2.1 Construction of Galois representation
We assume that (3.2) and (3.5) are satisﬁed. If the characteristic ofFis positive, these
are unconditional. If the characteristic of Fis zero, these conditions are satisﬁed if the
absolute ramiﬁcation index of Fis large enough as in Lemma 3.6.
Deﬁnition 3.10. Letψ∈F∨
p\ {1}. We deﬁne τψ,R,m,̟to be theWF-representation
whichistheinﬂationoftheirreducible QR⋊Z-representation H1
c(CR,F,Qℓ)[ψ]byΘR,m,̟
in (3.6). For simplicity, we write τψ,R,mforτψ,R,m,̟.
For a non-archimedean local ﬁeld K, letIKdenote the inertia subgroup of K. Then
Kerτψ,R,mcontains the open compact subgroup IF(αm
R,βR,m,γR,m). Hence the representa-
tionτψ,R,mis a smooth irreducible representation of WFby Lemma 2.8(1).
LetGF:= Gal(F/F). We consider a general setting in the following lemma.
Lemma 3.11. Let/tildewideτbe a continuous representation of GFoverQℓsuch that there exists
an unramiﬁed continuous character φofGFsuch that (/tildewideτ⊗φ)(GF)is ﬁnite. Assume
thatτ:=/tildewideτ|WFis irreducible. Then /tildewideτ⊗φis primitive if and only if τis primitive.
Proof.Let/tildewideτ′:=/tildewideτ⊗φandτ′:=τ⊗φ|WF. The subgroup Ker /tildewideτ′isopen by |GF/Ker/tildewideτ′|<
∞. Hence Ker τ′⊂WFis open. Therefore τ′is smooth. Hence so is τ. Sinceτis
irreducible and smooth, we have dim τ <∞. We will show that /tildewideτ′is imprimitive if and
only ifτis imprimitive.
9First, assumeanisomorphism /tildewideτ′≃IndGF
Hη′withapropersubgroup H. Wecancheck
Ker/tildewideτ′⊂H. HenceHis open. Hence we can write H=GF′with a ﬁnite extension
F′/F. Hence we obtain an isomorphism τ≃IndWF
WF′(η′|WF′⊗φ−1|WF′).
To the contrary, assume τ≃IndWF
Hσ. In the same manner as above with replacing
GFbyWF, the subgroup His an open subgroup of WFof ﬁnite index by dim τ <∞.
Hence we can write H=WF′with a ﬁnite extension F′/F. Letσ′:=σ⊗φ|WF′.
We haveτ′≃IndWF
WF′σ′. Frobenius reciprocity implies that σ′(WF′)⊂τ′(WF). By
the assumption, the image σ′(WF′) is ﬁnite. Hence the smooth WF′-representation σ′
extends to a smooth representation of GF′, for which we write /tildewideσ([2, Proposition 28.6]).
The restriction of IndGF
GF′/tildewideσtoWFis isomorphic to IndWF
WF′σ′≃τ′. Both of IndGF
GF′/tildewideσand
/tildewideτ′are smooth irreducible GF-representations whose restrictions to WFare isomorphic to
τ′. Hence we obtain an isomorphism /tildewideτ′≃IndGF
GF′/tildewideσasGF-representations by [2, Lemma
28.6.2(2)].
Lemma 3.12. The eigenvalues of Fr∗
qonH1
c(CR,F,Qℓ)[ψ]have the forms ζ√qwith roots
of unityζ. The automorphism Fr∗
qis semi-simple.
Proof.The claims follow from Proposition 2.10.
The cohomology group H1
c(CR,F,Qℓ)[ψ] is regarded as a representation of QR,m⋊/hatwideZ.
By inﬂating this by a natural map GF→QR,m⋊/hatwideZextending Θ R,m,̟, we obtain a
continuous representation of GF. We denote this representation by /tildewideτψ,R,m. Letφ:GF→
Q×
ℓbe the unramiﬁed character sending a geometric Frobenius to√q−1. The image of
GFby the twist/tildewideτ′:=/tildewideτψ,R,m⊗φis ﬁnite by Lemma 3.12. By ﬁxing an isomorphism
Qℓ≃C, we obtain a continuous representation /tildewideτ′
CofGFoverCby/tildewideτ′. Then/tildewideτ′
Cis
primitive if and only if /tildewideτψ,R,mis primitive.
Corollary 3.13. TheWF-representation τψ,R,mis primitive if and only if the continuous
GF-representation /tildewideτ′
Cis primitive.
Proof.Clearly/tildewideτ′
Cis primitive if and only if /tildewideτ′is primitive. We obtain the claim by
applying Lemma 3.11 with /tildewideτ=/tildewideτψ,R,mandτ=τψ,R,m.
3.2.2 Swan conductor exponent
In the sequel, we compute the Swan conductor exponent Sw( τψ,R,m).
We simply write α,β,γforαR,βR,m,γR,min Deﬁnition 3.1, respectively. We consider
the unramiﬁed ﬁeld extension Fr/Fof degreersuch thatN:=Fr(α,β,γ) is Galois over
F. LetT:=Fr(α) andM:=T(β). Then we have
F⊂Fr⊂T⊂M⊂N.
LetL/Kbe a Galois extension of non-archimedean local ﬁelds with Galois group G.
Let{Gi}i≥−1denote the upper numbering ramiﬁcation groups of Gin [15, IV §3]. Let
ψL/Kdenote the Herbrand function of L/K.
Lemma 3.14. LetG:= Gal(N/F). Then we have
ψN/F(t) =


{1} otherwise.
Proof.We easily have
ψT/F(t) =/braceleftBigg
tift≤0,
dRtotherwise.
For a ﬁnite Galois extension L/K, let{Gal(L/K)u}u≥−1be the lower numbering ram-
iﬁcation subgroups. Let 1 /\e}atio\slash=σ∈Gal(M/T). Letbσ=σ(β)−βas before. We have
/tildewideER(β+bσ) =/tildewideER(β) by the proof of Lemma 3.4. If v(bσ)>0, we obtain bσ= 0 by the
same argument in the proof of Lemma 3.9. This implies that σ= 1. By (3.2), we have
v(bσ) = 0. ByvM(β) =−m, we havevM(σ(̟M)−̟M) =m+1. Hence
Gal(M/T)u=/braceleftBigg
Gal(M/T) ifu≤m,
{1} otherwise,ψM/T(t) =/braceleftBigg
t ift≤m,
p2et−(p2e−1)motherwise.
Let 1/\e}atio\slash=σ∈Gal(N/M). IfvN(σ(γ)−γ)>0, we obtain σ(γ) =γin the same way as
the proof of Lemma 3.9. This implies that σ= 1. Hence vN(σ(γ)−γ) = 0. Let̟Nbe a
uniformizer of N. ByvN(γ−1) = (pe+1)m, we havevN(σ(̟N)−̟N) = (pe+1)m+1.
Thus
Gal(N/M)u=/braceleftBigg
Gal(N/M) ifu≤(pe+1)m,
{1} otherwise,
ψN/M(t) =/braceleftBigg
t ift≤(pe+1)m,
pt−(p−1)(pe+1)motherwise.
Hence the former claim follows from ψN/F=ψN/M◦ψM/T◦ψT/F.
We can check
Gu=

Gal(N/Fr) if−1<u≤0,
Gal(N/T) if 0<u≤m,
Gal(N/M) ifm<u≤(pe+1)m,
{1} otherwise
by using the former claim and [15, Propositions 12(c), 13(c) and 15 in IV§3]. Hence the
latter claim follows from Gi=GψN/F(i).
Corollary 3.15. We have Sw(τψ,R,m) =m(pe+1)/dR.
Proof.Recall that the twist τψ,R,m⊗φfactors through a ﬁnite group QR⋊(Z/rZ)≃
Gal(Fr(α,β,γ)/F) with a certain integer r. Sinceφis unramiﬁed, we have Sw( τψ,R,m) =
Sw(τψ,R,m⊗φ). WehaveSw( τψ,R,m⊗φ) =m(pe+1)/dRbyLemma3.14and[7, Th´ eor` eme
7.7] ([15, Exercise 2 in §2VI]).
113.3 Symplectic module associated to Galois representation
Letρ:WF→PGLpe(Qℓ) denote the composite of τψ,R,m:WF→GLpe(Qℓ) with the
natural map GL pe(Qℓ)→PGLpe(Qℓ).
Letρ′be the projective representation associated to /tildewideτ′=/tildewideτψ,R,m⊗φ.
Lemma 3.16. We haveρ(WF) =ρ′(GF), which is ﬁnite.
Proof.Since/tildewideτ′is a smooth irreducible GF-representation, we have /tildewideτ′(GF) = (τψ,R,m⊗
φ)(WF) ([2, the proof of Lemma 2 in 28.6]). This implies the claim.
LetFρdenote the kernel ﬁeld of ρandTρthe maximal tamely ramiﬁed extension of
FinFρ. Let
H:= Gal(Fρ/Tρ)⊂G:= Gal(Fρ/F).
The homomorphism ρinduces an injection ¯ ρ:G→PGLpe(Qℓ). LetVRbe as in Lemma
2.6.
Letτdenote the composite
QR,m⋊Z→AutQℓ(H1
c(CR,F,Qℓ)[ψ])→AutQℓ(H1
c(CR,F,Qℓ)[ψ])/Q×
ℓ.
Lemma 3.17. We have an isomorphism ¯ρ(H)≃VR.
Proof.LetL:=Fur(αm
R,βR,m,γR,m) andK:=Fur(αm
R). By (3.8), we have
W(L/F)≃QR,m⋊Z, W(L/K)≃HR.
Thesubﬁeld Kisthemaximal tamelyramiﬁed extension of FinL. WehaveFρ⊂Land
Tρ=Fρ∩K. We have isomorphisms G=W(Fρ/F)≃WF/Kerρ≃(QR,m⋊Z)/Kerτ
andH= Gal(Fρ/Tρ)≃HR/(HR∩Kerτ). By Lemma 2.9, we have HR∩Kerτ=Z(HR).
Hence the claim follows from the isomorphism VR∼− →HR/Z(HR);β/ma√sto→(1,β,0).
Let
H0:=G/H= Gal(Tρ/F).
Letσ∈H0. We take a lifting /tildewideσ∈G։H0ofσ. LetH0act onHbyσ·σ′:=/tildewideσσ′/tildewideσ−1for
σ′∈H. This is well-deﬁned because His abelian by Lemma 3.17. We regard H≃VR
as anFp[H0]-module.
By Lemma 3.12, we can take a positive integer rsuch thatrZ⊂Kerτandxqr=x
forx∈µdR,m. LetZ/rZact onµdR,mby 1·x=xq−1. We take a generator α∈µdR,m.
Let
H:=µdR,m⋊(Z/rZ)∼− →/angbracketleftbig
σ,τ|σr= 1, τdR,m= 1, στσ−1=τq/angbracketrightbig
,(3.9)
where the isomorphism is given by ( α,0)/ma√sto→τand (1,−1)/ma√sto→σ. The groups H0andH
are supersolvable. We consider the commutative diagram
QR,m⋊Z /d47/d47
/d15/d15(QR,m⋊Z)/Kerτ≃G
/d15/d15
H≃(QR,m⋊Z)/(HR⋊rZ)ϕ/d47/d47(QR,m⋊Z)/(Kerτ·HR)≃H0,
where every map is canonical and surjective.
12Lemma 3.18. The elements ϕ(α,0)andϕ(1,−1)inH0act onH≃VRbyx/ma√sto→αx
andx/ma√sto→xqforx∈VR, respectively.
Proof.These are directly checked.
We can regard VRas anFp[H]-module via ϕ. LetωRbe as in Lemma 2.6(2).
Lemma 3.19. We haveωR(hx,hx′) =ωR(x,x′)forh∈H.
Proof.The claim for h=αfollows from (2.4). For h= (1,−1), the claim follows from
ωR(xq,x′q) = (fR(x,x′)−fR(x′,x))q=fR(x,x′)−fR(x′,x) =ωR(x,x′).
Deﬁnition 3.20. LetGbeaﬁnitegroup. Let VbeanFp[G]-modulewithdim FpV <∞.
Letω:V×V→Fpbe a symplectic form. We say that the pair ( V,ω) issymplectic if
ωis non-degenerate and satisﬁes ω(gv,gv′) =ω(v,v′) forg∈Gandv,v′∈V.
Lemma 3.21. TheFp[H]-module(VR,ωR)is symplectic.
Proof.The claim follows from Lemma 2.6(2) and Lemma 3.19.
Deﬁnition 3.22. TheFp[H0]-module (VR,ωR) is called a symplectic module associated
toτψ,R,m.
Deﬁnition 3.23. Letσ:F→F;x/ma√sto→xq. Forf(x) =/summationtextn
i=0aixi∈F[x], we set
fσ(x) :=/summationtextn
i=0σ(ai)xi.
Letkbe a ﬁeld. We say that a polynomial f(x)∈k[x] is reduced if the ring
k[x]/(f(x)) is reduced.
Lemma 3.24. LetE(x)∈AFbe a reduced polynomial. Let V:={β∈F|E(β) = 0}.
(1)Assume that E(x)is monic and Vis stable under σ. Then we have E(x)∈Fq[x].
(2)Letrbe a positive integer. Assume that Vis stable under µr-multiplication. Then
we haveE(αx) =αE(x)forα∈µr.
Proof.Recall that f(x)∈AFis reduced if and only if f′(0)/\e}atio\slash= 0.
We show (1). By the assumption, we have Eσ(β) = (E(βq−1))q= 0 for any β∈V.
SinceE(x) is separable, there exists α∈F×such thatEσ(x) =αE(x). SinceE(x) is
monic, we have α= 1. Hence we have the claim.
We show (2). Let α∈µr. By the assumption, E(αβ) = 0 for any β∈V. Since
E(x) is separable, we have E(αx) =cE(x) with a constant c∈F×. By considering the
derivatives of E(αx),cE(x) and substituting x= 0, we have α=cbyE′(0)/\e}atio\slash= 0. Hence
the claim follows.
Deﬁnition 3.25. Letf(x)∈Aq.
(1) A decomposition f(x) =f1(f2(x)) withfi(x)∈Aqis said to be non-trivial if
degfi>1 fori∈ {1,2}.
(2) We say that f(x)∈Aqisprimeif it does not admit a non-trivial decomposition
f(x) =f1(f2(x)) withfi(x)∈Aq.
13Deﬁnition 3.26. Let (V,ω) be a symplectic Fp[H]-module. Then ( V,ω) is said to
becompletely anisotropic ifVdoes not admit a non-zero totally isotropic Fp[H]-
submodule.
For anFp-subspaceW⊂V, letW⊥:={v∈V|ω(v,w) = 0 for all w∈W}.
Proposition 3.27. The symplectic Fp[H]-module (VR,ωR)is completely anisotropic
if and only if there does not exist a non-trivial decompositi onER(x) =f1(f2(x))with
fi(x)∈Aqsuch thatf2(αx) =αf2(x)forα∈µdR,mandVf2:={β∈F|f2(β) = 0}
satisﬁesVf2⊂V⊥
f2.
Proof.Assume that there exists such a decomposition ER(x) =f1(f2(x)). Since the
decomposition isnon-trivial, wehave Vf2/\e}atio\slash={0}. HenceVf2isanon-zero totallyisotropic
Fp[H]-submodule of VR. HenceVRis not completely anisotropic.
Assume that VRis not completely anisotropic. We take a non-zero totally isotropic
Fp[H]-submodule V′⊂VR. By [13, 4 in Chapter 1], there exists a monic reduced
polynomial f(x)∈AFsuch thatV′={β∈F|f(β) = 0}. SinceV′is stable by σ, we
havef(x)∈Fq[x] by Lemma 3.24(1). Since V′is stable by τ, we havef(αx) =αf(x)
forα∈µdR,mby Lemma 3.18 and Lemma 3.24(2). There exist f1(x),r(x)∈Aqsuch
thatER(x) =f1(f(x))+r(x) and degr(x)<degf(x) by [13, Theorem 1]. For any root
β∈V′off(x), we haver(β) = 0 byER(β) = 0. Since f(x) is separable, r(x) is divisible
byf(x). Hencer(x)≡0 by degr(x)<degf(x). By deﬁnition, we have V′⊂V′⊥.
Hence the converse is shown.
Corollary 3.28. (1)TheWF-representation τψ,R,mis primitive if and only if the sym-
plecticFp[H]-module(VR,ωR)is completely anisotropic.
(2)TheWF-representation τψ,R,mis primitive if and only if there does not exist a non-
trivial decomposition ER(x) =f1(f2(x))withfi(x)∈Aqsuch thatf2(αx) =αf2(x)
forα∈µdR,mandVf2:={β∈F|f2(β) = 0}satisﬁesVf2⊂V⊥
f2.
(3)IfER(x)∈Aqis prime, the WF-representation τψ,R,mis primitive.
(4)IfR(x) =aexpeandFp(µdR,m) =Fp2e, theFp[H]-moduleVRis irreducible.
TheWF-representation τψ,R,mis primitive. If gcd(pe+ 1,m) = 1, the condition
Fp(µdR,m) =Fp2eis satisﬁed.
Proof.The claim (1) follows from Corollary 3.13, Lemma 3.17, and [11, Theorem 4.1].
The claim (2) follows from the claim (1) and Proposition 3.27. The claim (3 ) follows
from (2) immediately.
We show (4). We assume that there exists a non-zero Fp[H]-submodule W⊂VR=
{β∈F|(aexpe)pe+aex= 0}. We take a non-zero element β∈W. ByFp(µdR,m) =Fp2e,
we have Fp2eβ=Fp(µdR,m)β⊂W. SinceVRis the set of the roots of a separable
polynomial ER(x) of degree p2e, we have |VR|=p2e. HenceW=VR=Fp2eβ. Thus the
ﬁrst claim follows. The second claim follows from the ﬁrst one and [11, Theorem 4.1].
If gcd(pe+1,m) = 1, we have dR,m=dR=pe+1. Hence the third claim follows from
Fp(µpe+1) =Fp2e.
Example 3.29. For a positive integer s, we consider the set
Aq,s:=/braceleftBigg
ϕ(x)∈Fq[x]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleϕ(x) =n/summationdisplay
i=0cixpsi/bracerightBigg
,
14which is regarded as a ring with multiplication ϕ1◦ϕ2:=ϕ1(ϕ2(x)) forϕ1,ϕ2∈ Aq,s.
In the following, we give examples such that ER(x) is prime. We write dR=pt+1
witht≥0. Then we have ER∈ Aq,t. We write q=pf. Assumef|t. We have
ER(x) =e/summationdisplay
i=0aixpe+i+e/summationdisplay
i=0aixpe−i. (3.10)
Byf|t, we have the ring isomorphism Φ: Aq,t∼− →Fq[y];/summationtextr
i=0cixpti/ma√sto→/summationtextr
i=0ciyi,
whereFq[y] is a usual polynomial ring. The polynomial ER(x)∈Aqis prime if and
only if Φ(ER(x)) is irreducible in Fq[y] in a usual sense. Recall that a polynomial/summationtextr
i=0ciyi∈Fq[y] is said to be reciprocal ifci=cr−ifor 0≤i≤r. By (3.10), we
know that Φ( ER(x)) is a reciprocal polynomial. The number of the monic irreducible
reciprocal polynomials is calculated in [3, Theorems 2 and 3].
In general, we do not know a necessary and suﬃcient condition on R(x) forER(x)
to be prime. The number of prime elements in Aq,sis calculated in [4] and [12].
Proposition 3.30. AssumedR,m∈ {1,2}. There exists an unramiﬁed ﬁnite extension
F′/Fsuch thatτψ,R,m|WF′is imprimitive.
Proof.For a positive integer r, letFrbe the unramiﬁed extension of Fof degreer. We
take a non-zero element β∈VR. Lettbe the positive integer such that Fqt=Fq(β).
LetHt⊂Hbe the subgroup generated by σt,τ. The subspace WR:=Fpβ⊂VRis a
totally isotropic Fp[Ht]-submodule because of dR,m≤2. HenceVRis not a completely
anisotropic Fp[Ht]-module. Thus τψ,R,m|WFtis imprimitive by [11, Theorem 4.1].
Lemma 3.31. TheWTρ-representation τψ,R,m|WTρis imprimitive.
Proof.We take a non-zero element β∈VR. ThenFpβis a totally isotropic symplectic
submodule of the symplectic module VRassociated to τψ,R,m|WTρ. Henceτψ,R,m|WTρis
imprimitive by Corollary 3.28(1).
3.4 Root system associated to irreducible Fp[H]-module
A root system associated to an irreducible Fp[H]-module is deﬁned in [11]. We deter-
mine the root system associated to VRin the situation of Corollary 3.28(3).
We recall the deﬁnition of a root system.
Deﬁnition 3.32. ([11,§7])
(1) Let Φ be the group of the automorphisms of the torus ( F×)2generated by the
automorphisms θ: (α,β)/ma√sto→(αp,βp) andσ: (α,β)/ma√sto→(αq−1,β). A Φ-orbit of ( F×)2
is called a root system .
(2) LetW= Φ(α,β) be a root system. Let
a=a(W) be the minimal positive integer with αqa=α,
b=b(W) the minimal positive integer with αpb=αqx,βpb=βwithx∈Z, and
c=c(W) the minimal non-negative integer with αpb=αqc.
Lete′=e′(W) andf′=f′(W) be the orders of αandβ, respectively. These
integers are independent of ( α,β) inW.
15(3) Let Hd,r:=/angbracketleftbig
σ,τ|τd= 1, σr= 1, στσ−1=τq/angbracketrightbig
withqr≡1 (modd).
(4) We say that a root system Wbelongs to Hd,rife′|dandaf′|r.
(5) LetW= Φ(α,β) be a root system which belongs to Hd,r. LetM(W) be the
F-module with the basis
{θiσjm|0≤i≤b−1,0≤j≤a−1}
and with the action of Hby
τm=αm, σam=βm, θbm=σ−cm.
Theorem 3.33. ([11, Theorems 7.1 and 7.2])
(1)There exists an irreducible Fp[Hd,r]-moduleM(W)such thatM(W)⊗FpFis iso-
morphic to M(W)asF[Hd,r]-modules.
(2)The mapW/ma√sto→M(W)deﬁnes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of
root systems belonging to Hd,rand the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible
Fp[Hd,r]-modules.
We go back to the original situation. Assume that R(x) =aexpeandFp(µdR,m) =
Fp2e. Let Hbe as in (3.9). In the above notation, we have H=HdR,m,r. As in
Corollary 3.28(3), the Fp[H]-moduleVRis irreducible.
Proposition 3.34. We writeq=pf. Lete1:= gcd(f,2e)andβ:= Nrq/pe1(−a−(pe−1)
e).
Letα∈µdR,mbe a primitive dR,m-th root of unity. We consider the root system W:=
Φ(α,β).
(1)We havea(W) = 2e/e1andb(W) =e1.Further,c(W)is the minimal non-negative
integer such that fc(W)≡e1(mod 2e).
(2)The root system Wbelongs to H.
(3)We have an isomorphism VR≃M(W)asFp[H]-modules.
Proof.We show (1). We simply write a,b,cfora(W),b(W),c(W), respectively. By
deﬁnition,ais the minimal natural integer such that αqa=α. ByFp(α) =Fp2e,ais the
minimal positive integer satisfying fa≡0 (mod 2e). Thus we obtain a= 2e/e1.
By deﬁnition, bis the minimal natural integer such that αpb=αqxwith some integer
xandβpb=β. The ﬁrst condition implies that fx≡b(mod 2e). Hencebis divisible
bye1. Byβ∈F×
pe1, we haveβpb=βife1|b. Henceb=e1.
By deﬁnition, cis the minimal non-negative integer such that αpb=αqc. This is
equivalent to e1=b≡fc(mod 2e).
We show (2). The order e′ofαequalsdR,m. Letf′be the order of β. It suﬃces to
showaf′|r. By the choice of r, we haveαqr=α. Hence 2e|frbyFp2e=Fp(α), and
a|r. These imply that Fp2e⊂Fqa⊂Fqr.
Letη∈VR\{0}. Byηp2e=−a−(pe−1)
eη,ae∈F×
qand 2e|fr, we compute
ηqr= (ηp2e−1)qr−1
p2e−1η= Nrqr/p2e(−a−(pe−1)
e)η= Nrqa/p2e(−a−(pe−1)
e)r/aη.(3.11)
16The restriction map Gal( Fqa/Fp2e)→Gal(Fq/Fpe1) is an isomorphism because of a=
2e/e1. Byae∈F×
q, we have Nr qa/p2e(−a−(pe−1)
e) =β. Henceηqr=βr/aηby (3.11). Since
ηqr=ηby Lemma 3.18, we obtain βr/a= 1. Hence f′|(r/a).
We show (3). Let η∈VR\ {0}. Similarly to (3.11), we have σaη=ηqa=βη.
By deﬁnition and Lemma 3.18, we have τη=αη. TheFp[H]-moduleVRsatisﬁes the
assumption in [11, Lemma 7.3] by (2). Hence {0} /\e}atio\slash=M(W)⊂VRby [11, Lemma 7.3].
By the irreducibility of VRin Corollary 3.28(4), we obtain M(W) =VR.
A necessary and suﬃcient condition for an irreducible Fp[H]-module to have a sym-
plectic form is determined in [11, Theorem 8.1]. We recall the result.
Theorem 3.35. ([11, Theorem 8.1]) Let W= Φ(α,β)be a root system. The irreducible
Fp[H]-moduleM(W)has a symplectic form if and only if
(A)a(W)≡0 (mod 2) ,α∈µqa(W)/2+1andβ=−1,
(B)b(W),c(W)≡0 (mod 2) ,α∈µpb(W)/2+qc(W)/2andβ∈µpb(W)/2+1, or
(C)b(W)≡0 (mod 2) ,c(W)≡a(W) (mod 2) ,α∈µpb(W)/2+q(a(W)+c(W))/2andβ∈
µpb(W)/2+1.
There are two isomorphism classes of symplectic structures onM(W)in the case A,
p/\e}atio\slash= 2and one in all other cases.
Lemma 3.36. LetWbe as in Proposition 3.34. Let v2(·)denote the 2-adic valuation
onQ.
(1)Assumev2(e)≥v2(f). Then the module M(W)is of type A in Theorem 3.35.
(2)Assumev2(e)<v2(f). Then we have a(W)≡1 (mod 2) ,b(W)≡0 (mod 2) and
(b(W)/2)|e. Hence we have β∈µpb(W)/2+1.
(i)Ifc(W)≡0 (mod 2) , the module M(W)is of type B in Theorem 3.35.
(ii)Ifc(W)≡1 (mod 2) , the module M(W)is of type C in Theorem 3.35.
Proof.We show (1). Recall that e1= gcd(f,2e) andβ= Nrq/p1(−a−(pe−1)
e). We have
a(W) = 2e/e1≡0 (mod 2). Wehave e1|eandf/e1≡1 (mod 2). By( pe1−1)|(pe−1),
β= (−1)f
e1/parenleftbig
a−pe−1
pe1−1
e/parenrightbigq−1=−1,
where we use ae∈F×
qfor the last equality. By fa(W)/2 =fe/e1andq=pf, we have
αqa(W)/2+1=αpfe/e1+1. Sincefe/e1is divisible by eandf/e1is odd,dR,m|(pe+ 1)|
(pfe/e1+1). Hence we obtain α∈µqa(W)/2+1. Thus the claim follows.
We show (2). Recall b(W) =e1. The former claims are clear. By ( e1/2)|e, we have
(pe1/2−1)|(pe−1). By deﬁnition of βandae∈F×
q, we obtain
βpe12+1=/parenleftbig
a−pe−1
pe1/2−1
e/parenrightbigq−1= 1.
Henceβ∈µpb(W)/2+1. Assume that c(W) iseven. Wewrite ( c(W)/2)f= (e1/2)+lewith
l∈Zby Proposition 3.34(1). Then lis odd bye1= gcd(f,2e). Hence (pe+1)|(ple+1).
This implies α∈µpb(W)/2+qc(W)/2. Hence we obtain (2)(i). The remaining claim is shown
similarly.

Assume that p/\e}atio\slash= 2. Let (M(W),0) denote the unique symplectic module on M(W)
which is of type B or C by Theorem 3.35. Let ( M(W),0), (M(W),1) denote the two
symplectic modules on M(W) in the case where p/\e}atio\slash= 2 andM(W) is of type A. We
denote by ( M(W),2) the completely anisotropic symplectic module on M(W)⊕M(W),

i=1ωRi.
LetωRibe the form on VRiin Lemma 2.6(2). We give a recipe to make an example
of (M(W),2) below.
Proposition 3.44. Assumek= 2. LetRi(x) =ae,ixpe/\e}atio\slash= 0fori∈ {1,2}. Assume
m1/\e}atio\slash=m2, d:=dR1,m1=dR2,m2.
(1)We have an isomorphism VR≃VR1⊕VR2.
(2)We haveTR=T1·T2.
(3)Assume that p/\e}atio\slash= 2,v2(e)≥v2(f)andFp(µd) =Fp2e. If(VR,ωR)is completely
anisotropic as a symplectic Fp[Gal(TR/F)]-module,VRis isomorphic to a primary
module(M(W),2)with a root system W.
Proof.By Lemma 2.9 and Lemma 3.12, there exists an unramiﬁed ﬁnite extens ionE
ofFsuch thatFi⊂E(αmi
Ri,βRi,mi) fori= 1,2 andE(αmi
Ri,βRi,mi)/Eis Galois. We
putT:=E(αmi
Ri) =E(̟1/d) andEi:=T(βRi,mi) fori= 1,2. Letni:=mid/dR=
mi/gcd(dR,mi). Let{Gal(Ei/T)v}v≥−1be the upper numbering ramiﬁcation subgroups
of Gal(Ei/T). Similarly as the proof of Lemma 3.14, we have
Gal(Ei/T)v=/braceleftBigg
Gal(Ei/T) ifv≤ni,
{1} ifv>ni.
LetH:=E1∩E2. SinceEi/Tis Galois, so is H/T. By [15, Proposition 14 in IV §3], the
subgroup Gal( H/T)vequals Gal( H/T) ifv≤niand{1}ifv >ni. Hence we conclude
Gal(H/T) ={1}byn1/\e}atio\slash=n2. We obtain H=T. Hence we have an isomorphism
19Gal(E1E2/T)≃Gal(E1/T)×Gal(E2/T)≃VR1⊕VR2. The extension E1E2/Tis totally
ramiﬁed and the degree is p-power. Hence, Tis the maximal tamely ramiﬁed extension
ofEinE1·E2. Therefore, TR=FR∩T. We have the commutative diagram
Gal(E1E2/T)
/d15/d15≃/d47/d47Gal(E1/T)×Gal(E2/T)
≃
/d15/d15
Gal(FR/TR)g/d47/d47Gal(F1/T1)×Gal(F2/T2),
where every map is the restriction map. The right vertical isomorph ism follows from
Lemma 3.17. Clearly gis injective. By the commutative diagram, gis bijective. Hence
we obtain (1).
By the commutative diagram
1/d47/d47Gal(FR/TR)/d47/d47
≃
/d15/d15Gal(FR/F)/d47/d47

and injectivity of g1, the mapg2is injective. Hence TR=T1T2.
We show (3). Let r:= [E:F] and Hd,r:=µd⋊(Z/rZ) as in (3.9). We identify
Gal(T/F) with Hd,r. ByTR⊂T, theVR,VRiare naturally regarded as Fp[Hd,r]-
modules. Let αbe a primitive d-th root of unity. Let W:= Φ(α,−1). Then we have
an isomorphism VRi≃M(W) asFp[Hd,r]-modules and know that VRiis of type A by
Proposition 3.34(3), Lemma 3.36(1) and dR1,m1=dR2,m2. This implies an isomorphism
VR1≃VR2asFp[Hd,r]-modules. Hence the claim follows from the assumption that
(VR,ωR) is completely anisotropic and the deﬁnition of ( M(W),2).
Example 3.45. Assumep/\e}atio\slash= 2. Lete=f= 1,R1(x) =xpandR2(x) =axp∈
Fp[x]\{0}. We assume that m1/\e}atio\slash=m2anddR1,m1=dR2,m2=p+1. We have VRi={x∈
F|xp2+x= 0}fori= 1,2.
LetW⊂VR1⊕VR2beatotallyisotropic Fp[Gal(TR/F)]-subspace. Assume W/\e}atio\slash={0}.
We take a non-zero element ( x1,x2)∈W. We havefR1(x,y) =−xyp,fR2(x,y) =−axyp
and hence ωR((x1,x2),(ξx1,ξx2)) = (xp+1
1+axp+1
2)(ξ−ξp) = 0 for any ξ∈µp+1.
Hencexp+1
1+axp+1
2= 0 andx2/\e}atio\slash= 0. There exists η∈Fsuch thatηp+1=−aand
x1=ηx2. ByFp2=Fp(µp+1), we have W1:={(ηx,x)|x∈VR2} ⊂W. We also have
W2:={(ηpx,x)|x∈VR2} ⊂W. Let/parenleftbig·
p/parenrightbig
be the Legendre symbol. If W1∩W2/\e}atio\slash={0},
we haveη∈Fpandη2=−a. This implies/parenleftbig−a
p/parenrightbig
= 1.
Assume/parenleftbig−a
p/parenrightbig
=−1. ThenW=W1⊕W2=VR1⊕VR2byW1∩W2={0}. This is a
contradiction. Hence VR1⊕VR2is completely anisotropic if/parenleftbig−a
p/parenrightbig
=−1.
If/parenleftbig−a
p/parenrightbig
= 1, we have W1=W2, which is the unique non-zero totally isotropic
Fp[H]-subspace. Hence VR1⊕VR2is not completely anisotropic.
4 Geometric interpretation of imprimitivity
Through this section, we always assume p/\e}atio\slash= 2. Our aim in this section is to show Theo-
rem 4.13. To show the theorem, we use the explicit understanding of the automorphism
group ofCRand the mechanism of taking quotients of CRby certain abelian groups,
which are developed in [1] and [6].
204.1 Quotient of CRand description of τψ,R,m
LetCRbe as in (2.7). In this subsection, we always assume that there exist s a ﬁnite
´ etale morphism
φ:CR→CR1; (a,x)/ma√sto→(a−∆(x),r(x)), (4.1)
where ∆(x)∈Fq[x] andr(x),R1(x)∈AqsatisfydR,m|dR1andr(αx) =αr(x) for
α∈µdR,m. Sinceφis ´ etale,r(x) is a reduced polynomial. Hence r′(0)/\e}atio\slash= 0. By the
above assumption,
xR(x) =r(x)R1(r(x))+∆(x)p−∆(x) (4.2)
r′(0)/\e}atio\slash= 0, dR,m|dR1, r(αx) =αr(x) forα∈µdR,m. (4.3)
Lete′be a non-negative integer such that deg R1(x) =pe′ande′≤e. Then deg r(x) =
pe−e′by (4.2).
We haveαR1(αx) =R1(x) forα∈µdR,mbydR,m|dR1and (2.3). Hence ∆( αx)−
∆(x)∈Fpforα∈µdR,mby (4.2). We have ∆( αx) = ∆(x), since the constant coeﬃcient
of ∆(αx)−∆(x) is zero.
Lemma 4.1. Letφ:CR→CR; (x,a)/ma√sto→(x+c,a+g(x))be the automorphism with
g(x)∈Fq[x]andc∈F. Then we have ER(c) = 0.
Proof.We haveg(x)p−g(x) =cR(x) +xR(c) +cR(c). LetP:F[x]→F[x];f(x)/ma√sto→
f(x)p−f(x). By the deﬁnition of ER(x), we obtain cR(x)+xR(c)+cR(c)≡ER(c)1/pex
modP(F[x]). Thus we must have ER(c) = 0.
Lemma 4.2. We haveER1(r(x))|ER(x).
Proof.Letβ∈Fbe an element such that ER1(r(β)) = 0. We take an element γ∈F
such thatγp−γ=r(β)R1(r(β)). The curve CR,Fadmits the automorphism φdeﬁned
by
φ(a,x) = (a+fR1(r(x),r(β))+∆(x+β)−∆(x)+γ,x+β).
This is well-deﬁned by Lemma 2.2 and (4.2). By Lemma 4.1, we have ER(β) = 0. Since
ER1(r(x)) is separable, the claim follows.
Lemma 4.3. Letα,α′∈µdR,m. AssumeER1(r(αy)) = 0for a certain y∈F. Then we
have the equality
∆(α′x+αy)+fR1(r(α′x),r(αy)) = ∆(x)+∆(y)+fR(α′x,αy).
Proof.By ∆(α′x+αy) = ∆(x+(α/α′)y) and (2.4), we may assume α′= 1 by (4.3). We
haveER(αy) = 0 by Lemma 4.2. Let ∆ 1(x) and ∆ 2(x) denote the left and right hand
sides of the required equality, respectively. We have ∆ 1(0) = ∆(αy) = ∆(y) = ∆ 2(0),
sincefR(0,x′)≡0 inFq[x′] by deﬁnition. Hence it suﬃces to show ∆ 1(x)p−∆1(x) =
∆2(x)p−∆2(x). By Lemma 4.2 and the assumption, ER1(r(αy)) =ER(αy) = 0. Hence
each ∆i(x)p−∆i(x) fori= 1,2 equals (x+αy)R(x+αy)−r(y)R1(r(y))−r(x)R1(r(x))
according to Lemma 2.2. Hence the claim follows.
Let
UR:={x∈F|r(x) = 0} ⊂V′
R:={x∈F|ER1(r(x)) = 0}.
We haveV′
R⊂VRby Lemma 4.2. Then URandV′
Rare regarded as Fp[H]-modules by
r(x),R1(x)∈Fq[x] and (4.3).
21Lemma 4.4. We haveV′
R⊂U⊥
R. In particular, the Fp[H]-moduleURis totally
isotropic.
Proof.Letβ∈URandβ′∈V′
R. By Lemma 4.3, r(β) = 0 andER1(r(β′)) = 0, we have
fR(β′,β) =fR(β,β′) = ∆(β+β′)−∆(β)−∆(β′). HenceωR(β,β′) = 0.
Let

ThenQ′

We have the map
π:Q′
R,m→QR1,m; (α,β,γ)/ma√sto→(α,r(β),γ−∆(β)).
Corollary 4.5. The mapπis a homomorphism.
Proof.The claim follows from Lemma 4.3 and (4.3).
We have
U′
R:={(1,β,∆(β))∈Q′
R,m|β∈UR}= Kerπ. (4.4)
The spaceV′

CR,F/U′
R¯φ− →CR1,Fby (2.5). We obtain an isomorphism ¯φ:CR,F/U′
R∼− →CR1,F.
Lemma 4.6. We haveφ((a,x)g) =φ(a,x)π′(g)forg∈Q′

Proposition 4.7. We have an isomorphism τψ,R,m≃τ′′

Lemma 2.8(2), the map (4.5) is surjective. By comparing the dimensio ns, (4.5) is an
isomorphism. By inﬂating it by Θ R,m, we obtain the claim.
22We consider the open subgroup W′:= Θ−1

4.2 Totally isotropic subspace and geometry of CR
Let (1,β,γ)∈HRso, as in Deﬁnition 2.3(2), we know that γp−γ=βR(β). We obtain
(fR(β,β)−2γ)p=fR(β,β)−2γby deﬁnition of the pairing ωR(Lemma 2.6(2)). Assume
β/\e}atio\slash= 0, γ=fR(β,β)
2. (4.7)
The following lemma is given in [6, Propositions (9.1) and (13.5)] and [1, P roposition
7.2]. This lemma gives an algorithm of taking quotients of CRby certain abelian groups.
Lemma 4.9. LetCRbe as in Deﬁnition 2.7. Assume e≥1.
(1)Let
u:=xp−βp−1x, v:=a+(x/β)(γ(x/β)−fR(x,β)). (4.8)
Then there exists P1(u)∈AFof degreepe−1such thatvp−v=uP1(u).
(2)LetU:={(1,ξβ,ξ2γ)∈HR|ξ∈Fp}=/a\}bracketle{t(1,β,γ)/a\}bracketri}ht. Then the quotient CR,F/Uis
isomorphic to CP1,F.
Proof.We show (1). Let x1:=x/βandu1:=u/βp. Thenu1=xp
1−x1. We compute
vp−v=xR(x)+γpx2p
1−γx2
1−xp
1fR(x,β)p+x1fR(x,β)
=xR(x)+γ(x2p
1−x2
1)+β−2p+1R(β)x2p
−u1fR(x,β)−(x/β)p(βR(x)+xR(β))
=uβ−p(−βR(x)+β−p+1R(β)xp+γ(xp
1+x1)−fR(x,β)),
where we use γp−γ=βR(β) and Lemma 2.2 for the second equality. Let P(x) :=
β−p(−βR(x) +β−p+1R(β)xp+γ(xp
1+x1)−fR(x,β)). SinceP(x) is additive, there
existsP1(u)∈AFsuch thatP(x) =P1(u) +αxwith a constant α. By (4.7), we
haveP(β) =β−p(2γ−fR(β,β)) = 0. Hence α= 0. By deg P(x) =pe, we have
degP1(u) =pe−1. Hence we obtain (1).
We show (2). We easily check that the ﬁnite ´ etale morphism of degre ep:CR,F→
CP1,F; (a,x)/ma√sto→(v,u) factors through CR,F→CR,F/U→CP1,F. Hence we obtain the
claim. Since CR,F→CR,F/Uis a ﬁnite´ etalemorphism of degree p, theclaim follows.
23Let
∆0(x) :=−(x/β)(γ(x/β)−fR(x,β)).
We have
xR(x) =uP1(u)+∆0(x)p−∆0(x) (4.9)
by Lemma 4.9(1). We write u(x) foru.
Let (1,β′,γ′)∈HRbe an element satisfying (4.7). Assume ωR(β,β′) = 0. Then
(1,β,γ) commutes with (1 ,β′,γ′). Hence the action of (1 ,β′,γ′) induces the automor-
phism ofCP1,F≃CR,F/U((2.5)).
Lemma 4.10. Letπ(β′,γ′) := (1,u(β′),γ′−∆0(β′)).
(1)We haveπ(β′,γ′)∈HP1andfP1(u(β′),u(β′)) = 2(γ′−∆0(β′)).
(2)The action of (1,β′,γ′)onCR,Finducesπ(β′,γ′)onCP1,F.
Proof.Let ∆ 1(x) :=fR(x,β′)−∆0(x+β′)+∆0(x). By (4.8), the action of (1 ,β′,γ′) on
CR,Finduces the automorphism of CP1,Fgiven byu/ma√sto→u+u(β′) andv/ma√sto→v+∆1(x)+γ′
onCP1,F. We can easily check that ∆ 1(x)−∆1(0) is an additive polynomial such that
∆1(β)−∆1(0) =ωR(β,β′) = 0. Hence there exists g(u)∈Fq[u] such that ∆ 1(x) =
g(u(x))+∆ 1(0). Lemma 4.1 implies that EP1(u(β′)) = 0. Hence u(β′)∈VP1. We show
(1). The former claim follows from (4.9). By using ∆ 0(0) =EP1(u(β′)) =ER(β′) = 0
in the same way as Lemma 4.3, we have
∆0(x+β′)+fP1(u(x),u(β′)) = ∆ 0(x)+∆0(β′)+fR(x,β′).(4.10)
Substituting x=β′, and using ∆ 0(2β′) = 4∆ 0(β′) and (4.7) for ( β′,γ′), we obtain the
latter claim in (1).
By (4.10), we have
v+fR(x,β′)−∆0(x+β′)+∆0(x)+γ′=v+fP1(u(x),u(β′))+γ′−∆0(β′).
Hence the claim (2) follows from (2.5).
Assume that VRis not completely anisotropic. Let URbe a non-zero totally isotropic
Fp[H]-submodule in VR. There exists a monic reduced polynomial r(x)∈AFsuch that
UR={x∈F|r(x) = 0}by [13, Theorem 7]. Since URis anFp[H]-module, we have
r(αx) =αr(x) forα∈µdR,mandr(x)∈Fq[x] (4.11)
by Lemma 3.24. We write deg r(x) =pe−e′with a non-negative integer 0 ≤e′<e.
We take a basis β1,...,βe−e′ofURoverFp. Let (1,βi,γi)∈HRbe an element which
satisﬁes (4.7). Let Ui:={(1,ξβi,ξ2γi)|ξ∈Fp} ⊂HR, which is a subgroup. Since UR
is totally isotropic, we have ωR(βi,βj) = 0. Thus gigj=gjgifor anygi∈Uiandgj∈Uj
by Lemma 2.6(2). Let
U′
R:=U1···Ue−e′⊂HR, (4.12)
which is an abelian subgroup.
Proposition 4.11. Assume that VRis not completely anisotropic. Then there exist
R1(x)∈AFof degreepe′and a polynomial ∆(x)∈F[x]such that ∆(0) = 0 and
the quotient CR,F/U′
Ris isomorphic to the aﬃne curve CR1,Fand the isomorphism
is induced by π:CR,F→CR1,F; (a,x)/ma√sto→(a−∆(x),r(x)). In particular, we have
xR(x) =r(x)R1(r(x))+∆(x)p−∆(x). Furthermore, we have dR,m|dR1.
24Proof.By applying Lemmas 4.9 and 4.10 successively, the quotient CR,F/U′
Ris isomor-
phic to the curve CR1,Fwith someR1(x)∈AF, and we obtain π:CR,F→CR1,F; (a,x)/ma√sto→
(a−∆(x),r(x)). By (4.8), we have ∆(0) = 0. Since URis anFp[H]-module, the sub-
groupA:={(α,0,0)∈QR,m|α∈µdR,m}normalizes U′
R. HenceAacts on the quotient
CR1,F. Werecall that bp−b=yR1(y)isthedeﬁningequationof CR1,F. ThenA∋(α,0,0)
acts onCR1,Fis given by b/ma√sto→b+∆(x)−∆(α−1x), y=r(x)/ma√sto→r(α−1x) =α−1ythrough
the morphism πby (4.11). By [6, Theorems (4.1) and (13.3)] or [1, Theorem 4.3.2], we
must haveα∈µdR1. Hence the last claim follows.
Corollary 4.12. Let the assumption be as in Proposition 4.11. We have ∆(x),R1(x)∈
Fq[x].
Proof.We use the same notation in Deﬁnition 3.23. We consider the equality xR(x) =
r(x)R1(r(x)) + ∆(x)p−∆(x) in Proposition 4.11. Let S(x) :=−Rσ
1(x) +R1(x) and
Π(x) := ∆σ(x)−∆(x). We have S(x)∈AF. Byr(x),R(x)∈Fq[x],
Π(x)p−Π(x) =r(x)S(r(x)). (4.13)
AssumeS(x)/\e}atio\slash= 0. Wehavethenon-constant morphism f:A1
F→CS,F;x/ma√sto→(Π(x),r(x))
by degr(x)>0. LetCS,Fbe the smooth compactiﬁcation of CS,F. The morphism f
extends to a non-constant morphism P1
F→CS,F. Hence this is a ﬁnite morphism. By
the Riemann–Hurwitz formula, we know that the genus of CS,Fequals zero. This is a
contradiction by Lemma 2.10. Hence S(x)≡0 andR1(x)∈Fq[x]. We have Π( x)∈Fp
by (4.13). We have Π(0) = 0 by ∆(0) = 0 as in Proposition 4.11. Hence Π( x)≡0.
Thus the claim follows.
4.3 Theorem
Finally, we summarize the contents of §4.1 and §4.2 as a theorem.
Theorem 4.13. Assumep/\e}atio\slash= 2. The following conditions are equivalent.
(1)There exists a non-trivial ﬁnite ´ etale morphism
CR→CR1; (a,x)/ma√sto→(a−∆(x),r(x)),
where∆(x)∈Fq[x]andr(x),R1(x)∈AqsatisfydR,m|dR1andr(αx) =αr(x)for
α∈µdR,m.
(2)TheFp[H]-module(VR,ωR)is not completely anisotropic.
(3)TheWF-representation τψ,R,mis imprimitive.
If the above equivalent conditions are satisﬁed, the WF-representation τψ,R,mis isomor-
phic toIndWF
WF′τ′
ψ,R1,m, whereτ′
ψ,R1,mis given in (4.6).
Proof.Assume (1). Since CR→CR1is non-trivial, we have e′< e, where deg r(x) =
pe−e′. Thenwehave(2)byLemma4.4. Assume(2). Weobtain(1)by(4.11) ,Proposition
4.11 and Corollary 4.12.
The equivalence of (2) and (3) follows from Corollary 3.28(1).
The last claim follows from Corollary 4.8.
