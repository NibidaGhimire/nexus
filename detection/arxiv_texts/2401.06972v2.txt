ABSTRACT
Context. Diﬀerent studies have reported the so-called temperature prob lem of the narrow line region (NLR) of active galactic nuclei
(AGNs). Its origin is still an open issue. To properly addres s its cause, a trustworthy temperature indicator is require d.
Aims. No space for them in arXiv
Methods. We propose that the weak [Ar iv]λλ4711,40Å doublet is the appropriate tool for evaluating the density of the high excitation
plasma. We subsequently made use of the recent S7 survey samp le to extract reliable measurements of the weak [Ar iv] doublet in
16 high excitation Seyfert 2s. As a result we could derive the plasma density of the NLR of our Seyfert 2 sample and compared the
temperature inferred from the observed [O iii] (λ4363Å/λ5007Å) ratios.
Results. It was found that 13 Seyfert 2s cluster near similar values as the [Oiii] (λ4363Å/λ5007Å) ratio, at a mean value of
0.0146±0.0020. Three objects labeled outliers stand out at markedl y higher [Oiii] values (>0.03).
Conclusions. If for each object one assumes a single density, the values in ferred from the [Ar iv] doublet for the 13 clustering objects
all lie below 60 000 cm−3, indicating that the [O iii] (λ4363Å/λ5007Å) ratios in these objects is a valid tracer of plasma tem perature.
Even when assuming a continuous power-law distribution of t he density, the inferred cut-o ﬀdensity required to reproduce the observed
[Ariv] doublet is in all cases <105.1cm−3. The average NLR temperature inferred for the 13 Seyfert 2s i s 13 000±703 K, which
photoionization models have di ﬃculty reproducing. Subsequently we considered di ﬀerent mechanisms to account for the observed
[Oiii] ratios. For the three outliers, a double-bump density dist ribution is likely required, with the densest component hav ing a density
>106cm−3.

1. Introduction
Prevailing models of the narrow-line region (NLR) of active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) consider a distribution of photoion -
ized clouds that extends over a wide range of cloud densities
and ionization parameter values, whether the targets are Ty pe I
AGNs (Baldwin et al. 1995; Korista et al. 1997; Baskin & Laor
2005) such as quasars1(QSO 1s), Seyfert 1s and broad-line radio
galaxies, or alternatively Type II objects (Ferguson et al. 1997;
Richardson et al. 2014) which consist of Seyfert 2s, QSO 2s an d
narrow-line radio galaxies (NLRGs).
A concern when modeling the AGNs emission lines is the
handling of the plasma density, a parameter that can impact f or-
bidden line ratios and a ﬀect temperature estimates. AGN-driven
outﬂows are believed to play a crucial role in galaxy evoluti on by
curtailing star formation in massive galaxies, thereby sup press-

Croton et al. 2006). Accurately estimating outﬂow mass rate s
and energetics is therefore critical in understanding prec isely
how these outﬂows regulate star formation across cosmic tim e.
Constraining these parameters requires knowledge of the pl asma
density gradient toward the nucleus, as this is needed to mea -
sure the ionized gas mass, which is in turn essential in evalu at-
ing mass outﬂow rates and wind energetics (e.g., Nesvadba et al.
2008).
At densities above the critical density ncritof a particular for-
bidden line transition, collisional deexcitations from th e excited
states begin to dominate over radiative deexcitations, red ucing
the strength of the corresponding emission lines (Osterbro ck
1989). In the particular case of the [O iii] (λ4363Å/λ5007Å) ra-
tio (hereafter ROIII), in order to reliably determine the plasma
temperature of the high ionization emission regions, we mus t
quantify to which extent this ratio is a ﬀected or not by col-
lisional deexcitation. For this purpose, we rely on the weak

[Ariv]λλ4711,40Å doublet, which is a "direct" density indi-
cator appropriate to high ionization plasmas (Wang et al. 20 04;
Kewley et al. 2019).
This work is a follow up of the Binette et al. (2022, here-
after BVM) paper which studied the Seyfert 2 sample of Koski
(1978, hereafter Kos78), which had the particularity of pro vid-
ing reliable measurements of the [Ar iv] doublet in seven ob-
jects. The average NLR temperature BVM inferred from ROIII
assuming a power-law density distribution was 13 500 K, whic h
standard single-density photoionization models cannot re pro-
duce, underscoring the so-called "temperature problem" (h ere-
after TE problem), that is, where single-zone low density ph o-
toionization models underpredict the observed ROIIIratios, as
reported in various NLR studies (Storchi-Bergmann et al. 19 96;
Bennert et al. 2006a; Villar-Martín et al. 2008; Dors et al. 2 015).
In the current work, we determined the NLR densities and cor-
responding plasma temperatures using a larger sample consi st-
ing of 16 Seyfert 2s from the S7 survey (Dopita et al. 2015;
Thomas et al. 2017), which present reliable measurements of the
weak [Ariv] doublet. We subsequently explored possible expla-
nations to account for the larger temperatures observed wit h re-
spect to standard photoionization calculations.
Following the introduction of Sect. 1, we compare in Sect. 2
various methods for determining the NLR densities and in par tic-
ular the advantage of using the [Ar iv]λ4711,40Å doublet lines.
In Sect. 3 we describe the S7 survey and the procedure adopted
for the extraction of the [Ar iv] doublet while in Sect. 4, using
the [Oiii] (λ4363Å/λ5007Å) lines, we determine the tempera-
ture characterizing the Seyfert 2 galaxies of our sample tak ing
into account the densities we inferred from the [Ar iv] doublet.
In Sect. 5 we look at the implication of the densities encount ered
in the determination of outﬂow kinematics. The plasma tempe r-
atures we derive are higher than those predicted by the stand ard
photoionization models as indicated in Sect. 6, while in Sec t. 7
we review alternative explanations such as a double-bump io n-
izing energy distribution, the predominance of matter-bou nded
photoionized components, the presence of temperature ﬂuct ua-
tions, and ﬁnally the possibility of a non-Maxwellian elect ron
energy distribution. Throughout this paper, the adopted co smo-
logical parameters are H 0=67.4 km s−1Mpc−1andΩm=0.315
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2021).
2. Studies of the NLR and ENLR of active galactic
nuclei
2.1. Contrast between Type I and II narrow line region
In the NLR of Type I AGNs, signiﬁcant collisional deexcitati on
of the [Oiii]λλ4959, 5007Å lines2takes place, as corroborated
by the work of Baskin & Laor (2005, hereafter BL05) who com-
pared the ROIII(λ4363Å/λ5007Å) ratios observed in 30 quasars
from the Boroson & Green (1992) sample. The measured ratios
extended from 0.02 to 0.2. On the other hand, as pointed out
by BVM, the Type II AGNs from the Kos78 sample show ROIII
similar to those observed in the spatially resolved extende d NLR
(hereafter ENLR) where the densities encountered are moder ate,
typically<103cm−3. Although some level of collisional deex-
citation might be present in the Kos78 sample, BVM concluded
that its impact on the observed [O iii] lines ﬂuxes was not signif-
icant given that the densities they inferred from the [Ar iv] dou-
blet were all below 104cm−3. The explanation they proposed for
their Seyfert 2s to share a similar ROIIIratio that does not extend
2From level1D2to levels3P1and3P2.to the higher values commonly observed in quasars is the orie n-
tation of the AGN ionizing cone with respect to the observer.
As suggested earlier on by Nagao et al. (2001, hereafter
NMT), the geometrical set up behind the AGN uniﬁed model
(Antonucci 1993) might apply not only to the BLR but
to the inner denser parts of the NLR which possibly be-
comes partly obscured in Type II objects. NMT for instance
found that Type I Seyferts show a statistically higher ROIII
than Type II Seyferts. Meléndez et al. (2008a) favor a sim-
ilar interpretation with respect to the mid-infrared coron al
lines by pointing out that the mean [O iii]λ5007Å line lu-
minosity is 1.4 dex smaller in Seyfert 2s than in Seyfert 1s
while in the case of the mean luminosity of the far-
infrared [Oiv]λ25.89µm line, the diﬀerence between the
two subgroups is only 0.2 dex. This corroborates the earlier
works of Jackson & Browne (1991); Cameron et al. (1993);
Mulchaey et al. (1994); Keel et al. (1994); Rhee & Larkin
(2005); Netzer et al. (2006) who pointed out that a much highe r
dust extinction aﬀects the NLR of Seyfert 2s in comparison to
Seyfert 1s. Interestingly, Kraemer et al. (2011) found that among
AGNs with strong inclinations (i.e., with b/a>0.5), a com-
parison of the ROIIIand [Oiii]/[Oiv] (λ5007Å/28.59µm) ratios
among their sample reveal that Seyfert 2’s tend to present lo wer
values of both ratios with respect to Seyfert 1s, which they p ro-
posed is indicative that more extinction of the NLR emission is
present in Seyfert 2s.
The ENLR densities inferred from the red [S ii]λλ6716,31Å
doublet by Bennert et al. (2006a,b) appear in most cases to be in-
creasing toward the nucleus. If this gradient extended inwa rd to-
ward the supermassive black hole (SMBH), the resulting dens est
NLR sections might be expected to become hidden in Seyfert 2s
although not in Seyfert 1s. A graphical description of such g e-
ometry is illustrated in Fig. 2 of Bennert et al. (2006c). Fur ther
information concerning the plasma densities inferred from the
[Sii] doublet is given in App. A.
2.2. Densities characterizing the spatially resolved ENLR
By ENLR we emphasize that we speciﬁcally refer to emission
from plasma components that are spatially resolved. For the
Seyfert 2s of our sample, this implies any plasma localized a t
a projected radial distance rBH(from the SMBH) higher than 1.5
times the seeing size. In brighter objects such as QSO 2s, how -
ever, this minimum distance has to be larger since the centra l
source can dominate the emission up to several times the seei ng
size due to atmospheric blurring, causing a mixing of the un-
resolved nucleus emission with the foreground ENLR emissio n
(Villar-Martín et al. 2016). For observations taken with th eHub-
bleSpace Telescope (HST), since no seeing is present, the ENLR
initiates closer to the SMBH, at a projected radius rBHequals to
the slit width. Incidentally, ground-based adaptive optic s mea-
surements such as obtained with VLT MUSE o ﬀer a spatial res-
olution approaching that of HST (e.g., Winkel et al. 2022).
With HST observations, owing to the high spatial resolution ,
the ENLR can be resolved down to a smaller radial distance of
typically≃0.2′′from the SMBH. For instance, while ground-
based observations of ROIIIof the nucleus of NGC 1068 indicate
a value comparable to that observed in other Seyferts 2s (BVM ),
the HST-FOS measurements analyzed by Kraemer et al. (1998)
show emission from two knots situated at distances rBHfrom the
nucleus of 0.7′′and 0.2′′, respectively (i.e., at 57 and 16 pc, re-
spectively), which are superposed to a di ﬀuse background emis-
sion. The spectra of these knots are consistent with a radial in-

crease of ROIIItoward the spatially unresolved nucleus where
it reaches its highest value (see position of the three knot ROIII
measurements in Fig. 1 of BVM). The di ﬀuse plasma emission
surrounding the knots and the nucleus presumably dominates in
luminosity since ground-based observations of the nuclear re-
gion do not show an unusual integrated ROIIIratio. The gradient
in the ROIIIratio across the knots and the unresolved inner nu-
cleus might be the result of an increase in temperature due to
shock excitation, or more likely, to collisional deexcitat ion, as
was proposed by BL05 for the NLR of their quasar sample.
To conﬁrm when collisional deexcitation of [O iii] is present
or not, a reliable option to evaluate the densities consists in using
the [Ariv] (λ4711Å/λ4740Å) doublet ratio. Using the Magellan
Echellette spectrograph mounted on one of the Magellan Tele -
scope, Congiu et al. (2017) succeeded in measuring the radia l
behavior of the [Ar iv] doublet ratio within the ENLR of two
Seyfert 2s, IC 5063 and NGC 7212. The densities they inferred
were all below 104cm−3, except at the nucleus on the north side
of IC 5063. Using the VLT Xshooter spectrograph, Holden et al .
(2023) obtained deep observations of IC 5063 where the [Ar iv]
doublet measured in the nucleus implied a density in log10of
3.79+0.18
−0.19cm−3.
2.3. Prior studies of NLR densities in Seyfert 2s
Evidence of collisional deexcitation of ROIIIratio is presented
by Komossa & Schulz (1997) who addressed the TE problem by
exploring a wide range of parameters in their photoionizati on
calculations. Five of the 36 Seyfert 2 of their sample indica ted
ROIIIratios above 0.03. Single density matter-bounded models
with ne>∼105cm−3and a high ionization parameter could re-
produce the observed high ROIIIratios. However, in order to re-
produce the line ratios of other ionic species ([N ii], [Oi], [Oii],
[Neiii] etc), the authors had to adopt a multicomponent ap-
proach that combines photoionization models of four di ﬀerent
densities (log n=2,3,4,5) independently distributed at four
galactocentric radii. These components shared the same wei ght
in Hβluminosity (30%), except the densest (10% for log n=5).
In conclusion, the models that Komossa & Schulz (1997) fa-
vored assume subsolar metallicities and an ionizing SED con -
sisting of a thermal bump superposed to a steep αUV=−2 power
law. This procedure lead to a reasonable match to the behavio r
of the selected line ratios although the highest observed va lues
ofROIII≈0.03 could not be reproduced.
Another version of multicomponent calculations consists
of the Locally Optimally emitting Clouds (LOC) models of
Richardson et al. (2014, hereafter Ri14) and Ferguson et al.
(1997, hereafter Fg97) who calculated an extensive grid of m od-
els where each calculation integrates the line ﬂuxes over a w ide
range of both radii from the ionizing source and of cloud den-
sities at each radius (up to 1010cm−3). The abundances adopted
corresponded to 1.4 Z⊙. To model the high excitation Seyfert 2s,
their target ratios consisted of the subset a41, which repre sents
a weighted average of di ﬀerent optical lines derived from the
Sloan Digital Sky survey (SDSS) survey by Ri14 after apply-
ing the Mean Field Independent Component Analysis (MFICA)
tool (see also Allen et al. 2013) to their SDSS sample consist -
ing of∼104Type II emission line galaxies in the redshift range
0.1<z<0.12. Given the wide distribution of the densities cov-
ered by LOC models, collisional deexcitation is fully taken into
account and it allowed their models to reproduce the ROIIIratio of
the a41 subset as well as the bulk of the other line ratios cons id-
ered. As pointed out by BVM, however, no direct evidence wasfound that the densities of the observed NLR in Seyfert 2s ex-
tended beyond 105cm−3, even after assuming a power-law den-
sity distribution that extended up to a density cut-o ﬀconsistent
with the observed [Ar iv] doublet ratio, which suggests that the
much denser NLR observed in Type I AGNs (see BL05) might
generally be hidden in Seyfert 2s. In the current study we app ly
a similar approach but to a larger sample.
2.4. An approach based on the [Ar iv]λλ4711,40Å diagnostic
The [Ariv] doublet is a direct density diagnostic well suited to
studies of high excitation plasma (see Kewley et al. 2019). I t has
traditionally been used in the context of planetary nebulae (PNe).
Since the ion Ar+3is located in the high ionization plasma, the
densities inferred are more directly related to the [O iii] emis-
sion regions than those derived from the [S ii] red doublet, which
originates from the low ionization plasma. Its relative wea kness,
however, has hampered its use in AGNs studies. For instance,
out of the 2153 Seyfert 2s extracted from the SDSS-DR7 data
release by Vaona et al. (2012), the [Ar iv] doublet could be mea-
sured in only seven objects while the [O iii]λ4363Å line was
measured in 86 objects and the Fe viiλ6086Å line in 96 objects.
Interestingly, the densities inferred by Vaona et al. (2012 ) from
the [Ariv] doublet assuming a temperature of 104K were on the
order of 103cm−3(for their seven Seyfert 2s) while those they
inferred using the [S ii] doublet in 2300 objects showed a me-
dian value of 250 cm−3and only in 97 objects were the densities
found to be higher than 103cm−3. The aim of the current study is
to extend to a larger sample the analysis of BVM who disposed
of only seven high excitation Seyfert 2s with measured [Ar iv]
(λ4711Å/λ4740Å) ratios.
Assuming a 14 000 K plasma, the critical densities3for
the upper levels of the [Ar iv]λ4711Å andλ4740Å lines
are 1.69×104and 1.52×105cm−3while for the ROIIItem-
perature indicator, the critical densities of the upper lev els
of the [Oiii]λ5007Å andλ4363Å lines are 7 .67×105and
2.79×107cm−3, respectively. These results were derived us-
ing the PyNeblibrary version 1.1.18 (Luridiana et al. 2015).
The atomic data for [Ar iv] used by default in P yNebare taken
from Rynkun et al. (2019) and Ramsbottom et al. (1997), and fo r
[Oiii] from Storey et al. (2014), Storey & Zeippen (2000) and
Froese Fischer & Tachiev (2004). The e ﬀect of atomic data on
the densities determined from a given diagnostic line ratio can be
important (Morisset et al. 2020). We have explored all the co m-
binations of atomic data for [Ar iv] published after 1980, which
are available in PyNeb, and obtain very similar values. The same
applies for the critical densities obtained for [O iii] where very
similar results are also obtained, regardless of the atomic data
used.
3. The Seyfert 2 sample extracted from the S7
survey
3.1. The S7 survey data release
Our sample was originally extracted from the ﬁnal data re-
lease (Dopita et al. 2015; Thomas et al. 2017) of the Siding
Spring Southern Seyfert Spectroscopic Snapshot Survey4. The
S7 survey was performed over 2013–2016 using the Wide Field
3In accordance to the deﬁnition of critical density from Oste rbrock
(1989).

Spectrograph (WiFeS) on the ANU 2.3 m telescope at Sid-
ing Spring Observatory (Dopita et al. 2015). The sample con-
sists of 131 galaxies where most have been selected from the
Véron-Cetty & Véron (2006, 2010) catalogs of AGNs.
Among the 122 galaxies of the S7 sample with reliable mea-
surements of the [O iii]λ4363Å line, we excluded objects clas-
siﬁed as Seyfert 1s, or starbursts or having hybrid nuclei. A s in
the BVM study, we only considered objects where the [Ar iv]
(λ4711Å/λ4740Å) ratio is satisfactorily measured. This allows
us to evaluate to what extent the optical [O iii] emission lines are
aﬀected by collisional deexcitation, which is frequently obs erved
to be the case in the NLR of quasars (Baskin & Laor 2005). We
only considered high excitation Seyfert 2s, that is objects with
a dereddened [Oiii]/Hβ(λ5007Å/λ4861Å) ratio>7.0. It was
not possible to deﬁne an excitation sequence of Seyfert 2 spe ctra
since there were too few objects of lower excitation with a de -
tectable [Ariv] doublet. One advantage is that we are avoiding
possible degeneracies due to a mixture of ionization mechan isms
and/or to a wide range of ionization parameter, U. Our sam-
ple represents objects of comparable excitation that likel y share
the same excitation mechanism, that is photoionization fro m the
AGN nuclear accretion disk.
Our ﬁnal sample consists of 16 high excitation objects as
listed in Table 1. Their redshift covers the range 0 .004≤z≤
0.0171. After we excluded the three outliers (labelled a,b,c) with
anomalous ROIIIratios (as discussed in Sect. 3.5), the average
[Oiii]/Hβ(λ5007Å/λ4861Å) ratio is 9.67, which is comparable
to the high excitation subset a41 from Richardson et al. (201 4)
with [Oiii]/Hβ=8.6.
3.2. New emission line extraction
The ﬂux of the blended [Ar iv]+λ4711Å line5is on average three
times weaker than the [O iii]λ4363Å line; as a result, accurate
density estimates using the [Ar iv] doublet ratio require high S /N
spectra. Visual inspection of the [Ar iv] ﬁts provided in the of-
ﬁcial S7 data release showed them to be unreliable in a large
fraction of galaxies due to their faintness and prominent st ellar
absorption features. We therefore opted to use a bespoke emi s-
sion line ﬁtting procedure to obtain more accurate ﬂuxes.
5The appended+symbol denotes the presence of line blending.3.2.1. Emission line ﬁtting procedure
Most galaxies in our sample exhibit complex emission line pr o-
ﬁles due to AGN-driven winds and outﬂows, or strong jet-ISM
interactions, as in the case of IC 5063 (Morganti et al. 2015) .
As a result, multi-Gaussian component ﬁts are required to ac -
curately capture the ﬂuxes of strong lines such as [O iii]λ5007Å
and Hβ. However, ﬁtting multiple Gaussians that target the much
weaker blended lines such as He iλ4713Å or [Neiv]λλ4715Å
cannot be justiﬁed at the comparatively low S /N of these com-
ponents. Furthermore, this could introduce systematic err ors due
to possible mismatch of the stellar templates that are being ﬁt.
For this reason we adopted the following consistent approac h to
derive accurate measurements of the emission line ﬂuxes.
First, the blue and red datacubes were spliced together to
create a single "combined" datacube spanning 3500 –7000 Å.
This was achieved by spectrally convolving the higher-reso lution
R7000 cube with a Gaussian kernel in wavelength to the same
resolution as the B3000 cube before splicing them together.
The aperture spectra were extracted from the B3000 and
combined data cubes using the galaxy center coordinates giv en
in tableS7_DR2_Table_2_Catalogue except for 12 galax-
ies6for which visual inspection showed the supplied values
to be oﬀ-center. Center coordinates for these galaxies were
taken to be the brightest pixel in a white-light image com-
puted by collapsing the combined cube in wavelength. Spec-
tra were corrected for foreground Galactic extinction usin g
the dust map of Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011) together with
the Fitzpatrick & Massa (2007) extinction curve with R(V)=
AV/E(B−V)=3.1.
Emission lines were ﬁtted using the idlpackagelz-
ifu7(Ho et al. 2016). To extract accurate emission line ﬂuxes,
lzifu ﬁrst usesppxf (Cappellari & Emsellem 2004; Cappellari
2017) to ﬁt and subtract the stellar continuum by computing t he
linear combination of template spectra that best ﬁts the dat a. We
used the González Delgado et al. (2005) stellar templates du e to
their high spectral resolution. After subtraction of the st ellar con-
tinuum, the emission lines are ﬁt simultaneously using one o r
more Gaussian components, where the line-of-sight velocit y and
velocity dispersions are constrained to be the same for all e mis-
sion lines within each component. Optional Legendre polyno mi-
als may be included during the stellar continuum and emissio n

line ﬁts to account for stellar template mismatch and /or ﬂux cal-
ibration errors.
The nuclear emission lines were extracted from both the
1′′and 4′′apertures. Although a larger aperture yields higher S /N,
it also results in greater contamination from the stellar co n-
tinuum, which has a variety of complex absorption features i n
the vicinity of the [Ar iv] lines, as illustrated by the spectra of
Mrk 573 in Fig. 1. The ﬁnal aperture chosen for each object was
selected based on the balance between emission line S /N and the
severity of systematic errors in the stellar continuum ﬁt.
For red lines ﬂuxes, including H αλ6563Å and Heiλ5876Å,
we performed one, two and three component ﬁts to the combined
spectrum, where the optimal number of components was evalu-
ated using the likelihood ratio test with a critical thresho ld of
0.01 (e.g., Ho et al. 2016). A 5th-order additive polynomial was
included in the stellar continuum ﬁt to correct for ﬂux calib ration
errors. We then repeated this process on the B3000 spectrum
in order to obtain [O iii]λ5007Å, Hβλ4861Å, Hβλ4340Å and
[Oiii]λ4363Å ﬂuxes. For these ﬁts, a 12th-order additive poly-
nomial was included in the stellar continuum ﬁt to correct fo r
ﬂux calibration errors, and a 12th-order additive polynomi al was
included during the emission line ﬁt to compensate for resid uals
due to stellar template match.
Visual inspection revealed signiﬁcant stellar template mi s-
match in some objects in the wavelength range encompassing
the [Ariv] doublet lines. We therefore ran a series of tailored
ﬁts to obtain ﬂuxes for these weak lines. Due to the low S /N of
these lines, they were ﬁtted with only a single Gaussian comp o-
nent to avoid introducing additional systematic errors. We ﬁrst
attempted to obtain [Ar iv] ﬂuxes from the 1-component ﬁts to
the B3000 spectra discussed in the paragraph above, where vi -
sual inspection was used to assess the quality of the ﬁts. If t hey
were deemed unsatisfactory, we ran a second ﬁt on a smaller
wavelength range encompassing the [Ar iv] lines, including 3rd-
order polynomials during the stellar continuum and emissio n
line ﬁts, where the order was reduced from 12 to compensate
for the smaller wavelength range.There was a subset of nine objects for which visual inspec-
tion of the [Ariv] ﬁts from both methods described above was
not adequate. In these galaxies, the structure of the noise a nd/or
the continuum shape underneath the [Ar iv] doublet and/or the
faintness of the [Ar iv] lines (in particular λ4711Å) led to severe
systematic errors in the lzifu ﬁts. For these objects, we manually
measured the ﬂux of each [Ar iv] line by ﬁtting a single Gaussian
to each line, and by requiring the two doublet lines to have co n-
sistent FWHM within the errors. As an additional test, we mea -
sured the ﬂuxes simply by integrating the ﬂux underneath eac h
line proﬁle after subtracting the stellar continuum ﬁt gene rated
bylzifu . The continuum level and shape were also deﬁned sepa-
rately for each individual emission line. Because in these o bjects
the shape and level of the continuum are the main source of un-
certainty, in particular due to the undulating stellar cont ribution,
diﬀerent assumptions had to be made. The reported ﬂux errors
in these aﬀected objects account for the dispersion of the ﬂux
values from both methods.
3.2.2. Extinction correction of the measured line ﬂuxes
All emission line ﬂuxes were corrected for extinction intri nsic
to the AGNs using the H αand Hβﬂuxes. The internal galaxy
AVwas computed using the Fitzpatrick (1999) extinction curve
with R(V)=3.1 and assuming an intrinsic Balmer decrement
Hα/Hβof 3.1, as is appropriate for regions dominated by the
hard ionizing spectra of AGNs (Dopita et al. 2015; Thomas et a l.
2017).
3.2.3. Deblending of [Ar iv]λ4711Å due to weak He iλ4713Å
and [Neiv]λλ4715Å lines
Following the dereddening of line ratios, the next step con-
sisted of deblending the observed [Ar iv]+λ4711Å line4, which
is blended with the much weaker He iλ4713Å line, as pointed
out by Kewley et al. (2019), as well as with the [Ne iv]λλ4715Å
line. We note ﬁrst that, in our lzifu ﬁts, we did not separately

ﬁt the weak Heiλ4713Å and [Neiv]λλ4715Å lines, which are
blended to the dominant [Ar iv]λ4711Å line. The reason is that
in the majority of galaxies in our sample, the magnitude of th e
stellar template mismatch exceeds the amplitude of these ve ry
faint lines. Additionally, at the resolution of the B3000 sp ec-
tra, given the width of the line proﬁles, the [Ne iv]λλ4715Å
lines are fully blended with the [Ar iv]λ4711Å line and as a
result, the ﬂuxes of both lines would be poorly constrained w ere
they to both be included in the ﬁt. This is the reason for adopt -
ing the deblending procedure described in App. B, which re-
lies on measurements of the He i/[Ariv] (λ5876Å/λ4740Å) ratio
as well as of the [Ne iv]/[Ariv] (λλ4725Å/λ4740Å) ratio when
the [Neiv]λλ4725Å doublet is detected. Neither deblending
corrections are sensitive to the plasma temperature. Visua l in-
spection of the spectra revealed that ﬁve objects (ESO 138-G 01,
IC 2560, NGC 3281, NGC 4939 and NGC 5506) showed promi-
nent [Neiv]λλ4725Å emission. In these galaxies, the [Ne iv]
λλ4725Å ﬂuxes (or upper limits, when the S /N was poor) were
estimated by manually ﬁtting a single Gaussian proﬁle as don e
for the [Ariv]λ4740Å line in order to estimate the level of con-
tamination of the [Ar iv]λ4711Å ﬂux by the [Ne iv]λλ4715Å
doublet. Examples of the lzifu ﬁts in the region of the He ii
λ4686Å and [Ariv] doublet lines are shown in Fig 2 for six ob-
jects.
3.2.4. Line ratios from the high excitation S7 Seyfert 2
sample
In Table 1, we indicate for each object the aperture that was s e-
lected (Col. 3), the object redshift (Col. 4), the extinctio n values
AV(Col. 5) inferred from the observed Balmer decrement, and ﬁ-
nally the reddening corrected ratios of [O iii] (λ5007Å/λ4861Å)
(Col. 6) and Heii/Hβ(λ4686Å/λ4861Å) (Col. 7).In Table 2, we subsequently list the dereddened ratios of
[Oiii] (λ4363Å/λ5007Å) (Col. 3), [Ar iv]+(λ4711Å+/λ4740Å)
(Col. 4), RHe/Ar(λ5876Å/λ4740Å) (Col. 5) and [Ne iv]/[Ariv]
(λλ4725Å/λ4740Å) (Col. 7). The subindex +refers to blend-
ing being present in the [Ar iv]λ4711Å line measurement due
to the unresolved He iλ4713Å and [Neiv]λλ4715Å lines. The
adopted procedure for deblending [Ar iv]+(λ4711Å+/λ4740Å)
is described in Sect. 3.2.3 using the He iλ5876Å and [Neiv]
λλ4725Å lines, respectively. This correction is relatively m i-
nor since the inferred intensity of the He i(λ4713Å) line turns
out typically to be only ≃12±5.3% of the (deblended) [Ar iv]
λ4711Å line ﬂux. Finally, the deblended [Ar iv] ratios that were
used to constrain the NLR densities are listed in Col. 9 of Tab le 2.
In Fig. 3 we present, as a function of the aperture D(in units
of kpc) projected on the sky, the distribution of the followi ng
four quantities from Tables 1 and 2: the dust extinctions AVand
the three dereddened ratios of ROIII, [Oiii] (λ5007Å/λ4861Å)
and [Ariv]+(λ4711Å+/λ4740Å). The red dots correspond to
the three objects identiﬁed as outliers due of their anomalo us
ROIIIratios (see Sects. 3.3 and 3.5). No signiﬁcant correlation
was found between AVor the line ratios with the aperture size,
as indicated by the Pearson correlation coe ﬃcients ( P), which
are all negligible (<0.5). We concluded that the use of distinct
aperture sizes did not have any signiﬁcant impact on the resu lts
presented in this work.

represents their average ROIIIof 0.0146±0.0020. The circle’s
radiusσs=0.057 dex represents the sample dispersion of the
ROIIIratios. The three objects labeled "outliers" in Tables 1 and

in Sect. 3.5.
It is noteworthy that a similar clustering takes place among
the seven high excitation Seyfert 2s studied by BVM8using mea-
surements from Kos78. Their average ROIIIis represented by
the red circle centered at ROIII=0.0168 and whose radius of
0.088 dex represents the sample’s RMS dispersion.

red open diamond which corresponds to the high excitation su b-
set a41 extracted from the SDSS survey by Ri14. Unfortunatel y,
only the [Ariv]λ4711Å line was extracted by Ri14.
To illustrate the eﬀect of collisional deexcitation on the ROIII
ratio, the blue horizontal arrow in Fig. 4b represents the ROIII
ratios of a 13 000 K isothermal plasma in which the density
successively takes on values that increase from 102cm−3up to
106.5cm−3. For NLR densities above 105cm−3, we can expect the
ROIIIratios to take on much higher values as is indeed observed
among Type I AGNs from the BL05 quasar dataset, which are
represented in Fig. 4b by light-gray open squares. On the oth er
hand, for the S7 Seyfert 2s, the measured [Ar iv] doublet ratios
from Table 2 show evidence that the observed NLR have densi-
ties≪105cm−3, in which case we can trust the ROIIIratio as a
direct temperature estimator.

cussed in Sect. 3.5.
3.4. Comparison with ENLR observations
Superposed in Fig. 4b are the ratios observed from the spa-
tially resolved emission component of AGNs, the ENLR. They
are represented by three light-green ﬁlled symbols which we re
extracted from the following samples: ( i) the average of two
Seyfert 2s and two NLRGs (ﬁlled dot) from Binette et al. (1996 ,
hereafter BWS), ( ii) the long-slit observations of the Seyfert 2
IC 5063 by Be06b (pentagon), and ( iii) the average of seven
spatially resolved optical ﬁlaments from the radio-galaxy Cen-
taurus A (ﬁlled square) from Morganti et al. (1991, hereafte r
Mo91).
A remarkable feature is the near superposition of the ROIII
ratios from ENLR measurements with those of the NLR of
Seyfert 2s. Detailed modeling with photoionization calcul ations
(e.g., Tadhunter et al. 1994; Bennert et al. 2006a,b) indica ted
that the ENLR emission occurs at low plasma densities ( ne<
1500 cm−3). The simplest interpretation for the coincidence in
position in Fig. 4b of the ROIIIratios from the ENLR and the
NLR data sets is that in both cases the emission corresponds t o
relatively low densities in which collisional deexcitatio n is not
signiﬁcant. Interestingly, the six quasars from the BL05 sa mple
with the lowest values in ROIIIshare positions relatively close to
that of the NLR and ENLR measurements. We would propose
that the accumulation of AGNs at a similar position on the lef t
is most likely representing a ﬂoor AGN temperature where col -
lisional deexcitation of ROIIIis not signiﬁcant.
3.5. The three outliers
The three Seyfert 2s labeled outliers (yellow ﬁlled dots in
Fig. 4) correspond to the galaxies ESO 138-G01, Mrk 1210 andNGC 4507. Although the densities inferred from the [Ar iv] dou-
blet are comparable to the other sample objects, their ROIIIvalues
are signiﬁcantly higher than the average of the other nuclei . They
depart from the averaged blue dots position in Fig. 4a by more
than seven times the cluster dispersion in ROIII. This could sug-
gest that their plasma is much hotter ( ∼20 000 K), possibly as a
result of fast shocks (Binette et al. 1985; Sutherland et al. 2003),
or alternatively could be caused by a dual-density distribu tion
where some plasma components might possess densities above
>∼106cm−3as was considered by BVM to account for the high
ROIIIvalues encountered in 3 luminous QSO 2s where they had
measurements of the [Ar iv] doublet. Among the optical [O iii]
and [Ariv] lines, the only one not a ﬀected by collisional deex-
citation in this case is the [O iii]λ4363Å line since its critical
density is much higher, at 4 .5×107cm−3. With a dual-density
distribution where a very dense component is present, the in -
tegrated [Ariv] doublet ratio would be relatively una ﬀected by
such high density component.
Interestingly, a polarized BLR component has been
detected in Mrk 1210 (Tran et al. 1992; Tran 1995;
Storchi-Bergmann et al. 1998) and NGC 4507 (Moran et al.
2000). They were classiﬁed as S1h by Véron-Cetty & Véron
(2010, 2006). They possibly represent borderline cases bet ween
Type I and II AGNs. With respect to ESO 138-G01, the detailed
analysis of Alloin et al. (1992) reveals a strong stratiﬁcat ion of
the emitting gas clouds that correlates with the density as w ell
as with the presence of high ionization Fe species.
Mrk 1210 presents a very rich coronal line spectrum that in-
cludes [Si X], which is a very high excitation line not freque ntly
detected (Mazzalay & Rodríguez-Ardila 2007). ESO 138-G01 i s
also a strong coronal line emitter. It was classiﬁed as a "cor onal-
line forest active galactic nuclei" (CLIFF AGNs), which are
characterized by strong very high ionization lines, in cont rast
to what is found in most AGNs (Cerqueira-Campos et al. 2021).
Mazzalay et al. (2010) studied NGC 4507 as part of a sam-
ple of Seyferts selected on the basis of previous detection
of coronal lines. It was originally classiﬁed as a Seyfert 2
(Durret & Bergeron 1986), but later reclassiﬁed as S1h (i.e. ,
Seyfert 1.9) by (Véron-Cetty & Véron 2006) because of the
presence of a weak broad H αin its spectrum.
Using observed IRAS mid-infrared and far-infrared contin-
uum ﬂuxes at 25 and 60 µm, Meléndez et al. (2008b) derived the
spectral indicesα25−60of 98 Seyfert nuclei. The average index
values reported were α25−60=−1.5±0.1 for Seyfert 2s and
α25−60=−0.8±0.1 for Seyfert 1s. Interestingly, for the two out-
liers9Mrk 1210 and NGC 4507, the average index is −0.46, in-
dicating that the continuum emission originates from dust t hat is
hotter than in typical Seyfert 2s.
4. A combined temperature-density diagnostics
The utility of "diagnostic" line ratios such as ROIII, [Ariv]
(λ4711Å/λ4740Å) or [Sii] (λ6716Å/λ6731Å) is that they are
independent of metallicity since they involve ions of the sa me
species. The [Ariv] density diagnostic for instance depends on
density and negligibly on temperature while the ROIIIdiagnostic
ratio depends on both except in the low density regime ( ne<∼103
cm−3) (Osterbrock 1989) where it varies according to tempera-
ture. Therefore, in order to reliably measure the NLR temper -
ature, a handle on the plasma density is required, which is ou r
motivation for focusing on data sets where the [Ar iv] doublet is

observed. A concern is that while the ROIIIratio remains a valid
temperature indicator up to densities of ∼108cm−3, the [Ariv]
doublet ratio saturates and becomes progressively insensi tive to
the density beyond 105cm−3. Hence, in situations where the ob-
served ROIIIratio represents the emission from multiple density
components that extend beyond >∼106cm−3, the [Ariv] doublet
would not detect the higher densities while the ROIIIratio would
increase as a result of collisional deexcitation, whether o r not the
temperature remains the same across the di ﬀerent components.
Our goal is to determine the temperature of the observed
NLR by combining the ROIIIand [Ariv] diagnostics and requir-
ing that the inferred temperature and density simultaneous ly re-
produce the dereddened [Ar iv] (λ4711Å/λ4740Å) and ROIIIra-
tios of the S7 survey sample. First, we consider in Sect. 4.1 t he
simplest case of a single density isothermal plasma. The alg o-
rithmosald as described in App. C of BVM proceeds iteratively
using a nonlinear least squares ﬁt method to determine which
temperature and density are required to simultaneously rep ro-
duce the ROIIIand [Ariv] ratios. Subsequently in Sect. 4.2 we
assume a power-law distribution of the density that extends up
to the density ncutwhich is determined iteratively using osald .4.1. Temperatures inferred from the single density case
In Tables 1 and 2, the Seyfert 2 sample follows an ascending or -
der in the densities that were inferred from the [Ar iv] doublet.
These extend from 6000 up to 54 000 cm−3. The average temper-
ature for the sample of 13 Seyfert 2s is/angbracketleftBig

(that is,±0.023 dex). We ﬁnd remarkable that the S7 Seyfert 2s
clustered over such a narrow range in temperature values. Th e
average temperature inferred is comparable to the value of
13 480±1180 K derived by BVM for the seven Seyfert 2s ob-
served by Kos78.
4.2. OSALD algorithm: a power-law density distribution
The algorithm10osald was developed to explore the e ﬀect of
collisional deexcitation on the [O iii] and [Ariv] lines when the
densities extend over a wide range of values from 102cm−3up to
a cut-oﬀdensity, ncut. The intention is to implement the case of
NLR densities that increase radially toward the ionizing so urce
as was observed in ENLR studies (e.g., Bennert et al. 2006b).

4.2.1. Transposition to a simpliﬁed spherical geometry
The algorithm consists in integrating the line emission mea -
sures11of an isothermal multi-density plasma (hereafter MDP)
of uniform temperature T e. The calculations can be transposed
to the idealized geometry of a spherical (or conical) distri bution
of ionization bounded clouds whose densities ndecrease as r−2.
The clouds can be visualized as being radially distributed a long
concentric shells of negligible covering factor. The weigh t at-
tributed to each plasma density component is set proportion al
to the covering solid angle12Ω(n) subtended by each plasma
shell. In the case of photoionization models, such a cloud di s-
tribution would result in a constant ionization parameter Uoand
the integrated columns NXkof each ion kof any cloud would
be to a ﬁrst order constant. For the sake of simplicity, to de-
scribeΩ(n) we adopt a power law ( n/nlow)ǫ, which extends from
nlow=102cm−3up to ncut. If we transpose this to a spherical
geometry where both UoandΩare constant (i.e.,ǫ=0), the
area covered by ionization-bounded emission clouds would i n-
crease as r2, thereby compensating the dilution of the ionizing
ﬂux and the density fall out (both ∝r−2). In this case, the weight
attributed byosald to each shell is the same, otherwise when
ǫ/nequal0 the weight is simply proportional to Ω(n). MDP calcula-
tions are not a substitute to photoionization calculations . They
serve as diagnostics that could constrain some of the many fr ee
parameters that characterize multidimensional NLR models , in-
cluding the option of a nonuniform dust distribution where t he
opacity correlates with density, that is with r, as was explored
by BVM. The line ratios used as target in their diagnostics we re
not dereddened but were part of the simultaneous modeling of
the [Oiii], [Ariv], Heiand HiBalmer lines. In the current work,

density equal to that of H: n=ne=nH.we only consider reddening corrected line ratios and assume a
distribution of densities that extends up to a sharp cut-o ﬀ. The
latter is a free parameter, which is constrained through lin e ratio
ﬁtting usingosald .
To guide us in the selection of ǫ, we followed the work of
Be06b who determined that, for a spectral slit radially posi -
tioned along the emission line cone, the surface brightness of
the spatially resolved ENLR is seen decreasing radially alo ng
the slit as rδ(withδ < 0), where ris the projected nuclear
distance on the sky. From their [O iii]λ5007Å and Hαline ob-
servations of Seyfert 2s, Be06b derived average index value s of
δ[OIII ]=−2.24±0.2 andδHα=−2.16±0.2, respectively. Let
us assume that such gradient extends inward, that is, crossw ise
the unresolved NLR. For our assumed spherical geometry wher e
the Hαluminosity across concentric circular apertures behave as
r−2ǫ,ǫis given by−(1+δ)/2. Hence the value inferred for ǫ,
which describes how the covering factor varies with density , is
+0.6 in order that a long slit projected onto our assumed spher-
ical geometry reproduce the δ[OIII ]value reported by Be06b. To
derive the optimal values for the selected input parameters that
would reproduce as closely as possible the [O iii] and [Ariv] tar-
get line ratios,osald proceeds iteratively via a nonlinear least
squares ﬁt method as described in App. C.5 of BVM.
4.2.2. Temperatures inferred from a density stratiﬁed plas ma
The cut-oﬀdensities ncutinferred from the algorithm osald for
the case of a power-law density distribution are given in Col . 3
of Table 3. These extend from 4075 up to 1 .14×105cm−3.
What governs the integrated line ratios, however, are the me an
plasma densities. The luminosity weighted densities ¯ nwei, in Ta-
ble 2 (Col. 4), range from 2430 up to 66 700 cm−3. The average
temperature for the whole sample,/angbracketleftBig¯TPL
OIII/angbracketrightBig
, is 12 961±711 K,
which is essentially the same value as the single density cas e of
Table 2. The main reason is that the ROIIIratio varies relatively
little across the density interval covered. For instance, f or the
densest object, IC 2560, the shell densities of the ﬁtted pow er law
cover the range 102to 1.14×105cm−3and the ROIIIratios cal-
culated byosald across the diﬀerent shells span over the range
0.01252 to 0.01547.
As shown by the di ﬀerences in temperature ∆Tiso(Col. 5)
between the values derived from osald and those of the single
density case, the temperatures ¯TPL

numerical noise from the iterative procedure, except possi bly for
the last three objects labeled 11 to 13.
5. Comparison with densities inferred from outﬂow
studies
AGNs outﬂows are inhomogeneous and they extend over a
large range of densities and geometries. Consequently the o ut-
ﬂow rates, gas masses and kinematics that are inferred depen d
strongly on how the gas densities are estimated. We now revie w
some of the techniques used.
5.1. The use of trans-auroral and auroral lines
Evidence that the densities inferred from the red [S ii] doublet are
not representative of the plasma observed in the NLR, or even the
ENLR plasma, has been demonstrated in studies of outﬂows ob-
served in Type II AGNs where the emission line proﬁle was ﬁt-

ted using a central component to represent the stationary pl asma
and one or more velocity shifted proﬁles that ﬁtted the asymm et-
ric component, the latter being interpreted as out-ﬂowing w inds.
A technique developed by Holt et al. (2011) to determine NLR
densities in Type II AGNs made use of the trans-auroral and au -
roral [Sii] and [Oii] lines. The [Sii] (λλ4069,76Å/λλ6716,31Å)
and [Oii] (λλ3726,29Å/λλ7320,31Å) ratios are sensitive to
densities up to 106cm−3and when both ratios are com-
bined, one can simultaneously determine the plasma density
and the intervening dust extinction. The densities inferre d by
Rose et al. (2018) and Spence et al. (2018) for the outﬂowing
plasma13component in ten Type II ULIRGs ranged from 103
to 104.6cm−3. For the ULIRG Pks B1345 +12, the densities in-
ferred by Holt et al. (2011) from the intermediate and very br oad
NLR proﬁle components were 104.2and 105.5cm−3, respec-
tively, while for the AGN Pks B1934-63 the densities inferre d
by Santoro et al. (2018) for the corresponding components we re
104.6and 105.5cm−3, respectively.
Davies et al. (2020, hereafter Da20) similarly used the tran s-
auroral and auroral [S ii] and [Oii] lines to evaluate the densi-
ties of eight Type II objects14. They calibrated their density di-
agnostic diagram using photoionization calculations that took
into account diﬀerences in temperature and ionization of the re-
gions which emit the trans-auroral and auroral lines. The de n-
sities encountered ranged from 103.0to 103.6cm−3. The me-
dian density for the sample was 1900 cm−3, which is more
than ﬁve times higher than the median density inferred from
the [Sii]λλ6716,31Å doublet measurements from their sam-
ple. After comparing how the red [S ii]λλ6716,31Å doublet and
[Oiii]/Hβratios varied across their respective proﬁles, Da20
found no evidence in their sample of an emission component
that could be speciﬁcally associated to the systemic veloci ty (as
deﬁned by the stellar absorption lines). They commented tha t
the multiple Gaussians from their proﬁle ﬁts do not represen t
distinct outﬂow components and for this reason they use the f ull
integrated line ﬂuxes in their analysis of the outﬂow densit ies.
5.2. The ionization parameter estimation method
In objects where no reliable density diagnostic is availabl e,
Baron & Netzer (2019) proposed a method which they labeled
"ionization parameter estimation". By comparing the [O iii]/Hβ
(λ5007Å/λ4861Å) and [Nii]/Hα(λ6583Å/λ6563Å) ratios with
the predictions of photoionization calculations, one can a ttribute
a value to the ionization parameter U. The plasma density ne
is then derived from the expression ne≃nH=QH/Uc4πr2
emiwhere QHis the photon luminosity rate from the ionizing source,
which is determined by estimating the AGN bolometric lumi-
nosity assuming a standard SED. To determine ne, this tech-
nique is only applicable to spatially resolved measurement s as
it requires knowledge of the distance remiseparating the point
source nucleus from the position of the line measurement (al ong
the slit or at a given IFU). However, a novel technique to esti -
mate remiwithin the unresolved nuclear NLR was proposed by
(Baron & Netzer 2019). It consisted in evaluating the mean lo -
cation of the dust responsible for the mid-infrared excess e mis-
sion from the outﬂows, which were measured using the 2-Micro n
All-Sky Survey (Skrutskie et al. 2006). For their sample of 2 34
ionized outﬂows in Type II AGNs extracted from the ALPAKA
catalog (Mullaney et al. 2013), the mass-weighted average d ust

14It included one object conﬁrmed as Type 1.8 and another as Typ e 1.9.location, rdust, was≈200 pc±0.25 dex (Fig. 6 of Baron & Netzer
2019). The mean density that characterized their whole samp le
was 104.5cm−3, that is more than an order of magnitude above
the values inferred from the [S ii]λλ6716,31Å doublet.
The density method of Baron & Netzer (2019) based on the
estimated ionization parameter was incorporated to the Da2 0
study mentioned above and applied to 11 Type II AGNs of their
sample. For their sample which integrated the emission of th e
nucleus with an IFU of 1 .8′′×1.8′′, they estimated the projected
size of the nucleus distance as corresponding to half the IFU size,
that is 0.9′′. The eﬀect of projection was subsequently taken into
account by multiplying the projected radius (in pc) by a fact or of
1.4, which corresponds to a disk inclination of 45°. The dens ities
they encountered extended from 102.9to 104.8cm−3. The median
density for the whole sample is 4800 cm−3while the correspond-
ing value using the trans-auroral lines method discussed ab ove is
1900 cm−3. As recognized by Da20, this method is most suited
to spatially resolved data, where one can obtain measuremen ts
at a known projected distance remifrom the AGN nucleus. Since
their dataset consisted of spatially integrated nucleus me asure-
ments, Da20 recommended one should make use of the derived
densities in a statistical sense rather than focusing on ind ividual
values.
5.3. Beneﬁts of high spatial resolution HST observations of
outﬂows
Reaching much smaller projected nucleus distances remiis pos-
sible by using observations from the Space Telescope Imagin g
Spectrograph (STIS), as shown by Revalski et al. (2021). Spa -
tially resolved observations are essential for localizing AGN
feedback and determining accurately the wind kinematics. O b-
servations of the [Ar iv] doublet was reported by Revalski et al.
(2018) in only one object, Mrk 573. In their study, the author s
combined with varying weights three di ﬀerent photoionization
models corresponding to a high, intermediate and low Uval-
ues at each location along the STIS slit observations as well as
of the DIS long-slit from the Apache Point Observatory (APO) .
The line ratios with respect to H βat each radial location were
generally well reproduced (their Fig. 9) across the whole EN LR
except for the two [O i] optical lines and the two [Ar iv]/Hβra-
tios, although it had relatively little impact on their dete rmination
of the peak outﬂow velocity as well as other global wind kinet -
ics. At only two positions along the HST-STIS slit do we sug-
gest a distinct interpretation concerning the densities in ferred,
that is at+0.05′′and−0.05′′from the nucleus, where their inter-
mediate Umodel favored densities of 105.1and 105.3cm−3with
a relative ﬂux weight of 50% in both cases with respect to the
high and low ionization models. Because of likely optical bl ur-
ring within the 0.2′′slit width, it is not possible in our opinion to
conﬁrm the value of remi, on which the model densities so close
to the nucleus are based. Using osald , the densities we infer at
the corresponding positions from the [Ar iv] doublet ratios of
Re18 are 22 600 and 4220 cm−3, which are values signiﬁcantly
lower. The corresponding temperatures inferred from the ROIII
ratios are 16 600 and 13 800 K, respectively15.
More recently, for six Seyfert 2s, Revalski et al. (2022) com -
pared the densities derived from their multicomponent phot oion-
ization models to other techniques that involve more assump -
tions about the gas physical conditions, but require less da ta
15To deblend the [Ar iv] doublet ratio of Mrk 573, we used the He i
(λ3889Å/λ4740Å) ratio since neither the He iλ5876Å nor theλ4471Å
line were reported.

and modeling (Revalski et al. 2022). For instance, the three ion-
ization parameter values assumed (log U=[−1.5,−2.0,−2.5])
were the same at each radial location for all six objects. A go od
match of the observed line ratios along the slit was obtained al-
though the assumed remivalues at the position of the nucleus re-
mained unconstrained and the caveat mentioned above by Da20
concerning the densities inferred from a spatially unresol ved
remivalue would still apply to their analysis, as acknowledged
by Revalski et al. (2021). If we exclude those calculations p o-
sitioned at the closest distance from the SMBH, the densitie s
inferred at the other radii, among their sample of six Seyfer t 2s,
all fall below 105cm−3except Mrk 3.
6. Standard photoionization calculations
Having shown that collisional deexcitation of the [O iii] opti-
cal lines is relatively insigniﬁcant among a large fraction of
Seyfert 2s from the S7 sample, we ﬁrst illustrate the di ﬃculty
in reproducing the typical ROIIIratio observed in Seyfert 2s and
subsequently explore in Sec. 7 possible solutions.
6.1. Standard input parameters for MAPPINGS Ig
calculations
Most model parameters share similar values across the calcu la-
tions presented below and in Sec.7. With respect to the plasm a
metallicities, it is generally accepted that gas abundance s of
galactic nuclei are signiﬁcantly above solar values. The va lues
we adopted below correspond to 2.5 Z⊙as in BVM, a value
within the range expected for galactic nuclei of spiral gala xies
as suggested by the Dopita et al. (2014) landmark study of the
Seyfert 2 NGC 5427 using the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS:
Dopita et al. 2010). High metallicity values are shared by ot her
observational and theoretical studies that conﬁrm the high metal-
licities of Seyfert nuclei (Storchi-Bergmann & Pastoriza 1 990;
Nagao et al. 2002; Ballero et al. 2008). Our selected abundan ce
set is twice the solar reference set of Asplund et al. (2006), that
is, with O/H=9.8×10−4, except for C/H and N/H which reach
four times the solar values owing to secondary enrichment. W e
can expect the enriched metallicities of galactic nuclei to be ac-
companied by an increase in He abundance. We followed a sug-
gestion from David Nicholls (private communication, ANU) o f
extrapolating to higher abundances the metallicity scalin g for-
mulas that Nicholls et al. (2017) derived from local B stars a bun-
dance determinations. At the adopted O /H ratio, the proposed
scaling formula described by Eq. A1 in App. A.c of Binette et a l.
(2023, hereafter BK23) implies a value of He /H=0.12, which
is mildly higher than the ratio of 0.103 adopted by Ri14. Our
calculations were dustfree and assumed a simple slab geomet ry
in which the plasma is radiation-bounded and exposed to ioni z-
ing radiation emitted by the accretion disk assuming an ioni za-
tion parameter deﬁned as Uo=φ0/cno
H, whereφ0is the ionizing
photon ﬂux impinging on the photoionized slab, no

density at the face of the slab and cthe speed of light.
6.2. Thermal ionizing continuum
The ionizing radiation from the nucleus was assumed to origi -
nate from thermal emission by gas accreting onto a supermass ive
black hole. Although thermal in nature, the spectral energy dis-
tribution (SED) is broader than a blackbody since the contin uum
emission is considered to take place from an extended disk th at
covers a wide temperature range. In their photoionization m od-Fig. 5. Ionizing SEDs inνFνunits: 1) the SED adopted by Fg97 for their

els, Fg97 and Ri14 assumed a SED where the dominant ionizing
continuum corresponds to a thermal distribution of the form
Fν∝ναUVexp(−hν/kTcut) (1)
whereαUVis the low-energy slope of the "big bump", which is
typically assumed to be αUV=−0.3, and Tcutis the temperature
cut-oﬀ. The values for Tcutadopted by Fg97 and Ri14 are 106.0
and 105.62K, respectively. Both distributions are shown in Fig. 5
(black dashed lines). The thermal component dominates the i on-
izing continuum up to the X-ray domain where a power-law of
index−1.0 takes over. For each SED hereafter considered, we
impose anαOXof−1.35.
6.3. Standard photoionization models
Assuming the Fg97 SED, a sequence of isochoric (i.e., consta nt
density) photoionization models was calculated with the co de
MAPPINGS Ig (see updates in BK23, BVM and App. B and

to 0.46. In each model, the same frontal16plasma density of

cantly lower than observed in the S7 survey (navy circle) or

from Ri14 (red diamond). The softer Ri14 SED shown in Fig 5
results in even lower ROIIIvalues, as shown by the yellow line

ported by various authors (e.g., Storchi-Bergmann et al. 19 96;

7. Possible solutions to the TE problem
Finding the cause of why model calculations predict values o f
ROIIIratios signiﬁcantly lower than observed is the next step.
Except for the three outliers, where a high density NLR compo -
nent is likely present, we considered that collisional deex citation
of the [Oiii] optical lines is unlikely the cause as discussed in
Sect. 5, at least among the current sample of 13 Seyfert 2s whe re
we could measure the [Ar iv] doublet as well as for the seven
Seyfert 2s from the Kos78 dataset (BVM). We present below a
few alternative solutions but do not rule out the existence o f al-
ternative interpretations that should eventually be explo red. The
calculations presented below all assume the same metallici ties of
2.5Z⊙and, except in S 7.1, the same ionizing SED of Fg97 with
Tcut=106.0K.
7.1. Double-bump continuum distributions
As pointed out by Lawrence (2012, hereafter La12), AGNs seem
to show a universal near-UV shape, reaching a maximum in
νFνat a wavelength of around 1100Å, regardless of luminosity
or redshift (c.f. Zheng et al. 1997; Telfer et al. 2002; Scott et al.
2004; Binette et al. 2005; Shang et al. 2005). To address the
TE problem, La12 explored the possibility that a population
of internally cold very thick ( NH>1024cm−2) dense clouds
(n∼1012cm−3) covers the accretion disk at a radius of ∼30Rs
from the black-hole, where Rsis the Schwarzschild radius. The
cloud’s high velocity turbulent motions blur its line emiss ion as
well as reﬂect the disk emission, resulting in a double-peak ed
SED superposed to the reﬂected SED. The ﬁrst peak at ∼1100Å
represents the clouds reprocessed radiation while the seco nd cor-
responds to the disk radiation reﬂected by the clouds, which
La12 positioned at ∼40 eV . The main advantage of this distri-
bution is its ability to account for the "universal knee" obs erved
at 12 eVin quasars. As shown by BVM, however, the resulting
SED did not signiﬁcantly increase the temperature of the pho -
toionized plasma. The authors argued that the second peak mu st
be shifted to much higher energies in order to reproduce the o b-
served ROIIIratio and thereby resolve the TE problem.
To achieve this, BK23 proceeded as follows. First, they ex-
tracted a digitized version of the published La12 SED and to
eliminate the 40 eVpeak they extrapolated the declining seg-
ment of the ﬁrst peak, as represented by the red dotted line in
Fig. 5. For the second peak, Fpk2
∗(ν), they adopted the formula,
ναFUVexp(−hν/kTcut) (i.e., Eq. 1). All the double-bump SEDs
which they explored were obtained by simply summing both dis -
tributions:
Fν=Fpk1
La12(ν)+R rpk2
21ναFUVexp (−hν/kTcut) (2)
where R=Fpk1
La12(νpk1)/Fpk2
∗(νpk1) is the renormalization factor
which we deﬁne at hνpk1=12eV, the energy where the ﬁrst
peak reaches its maximum in νFν. The position and width of
the second peak depend on both parameters αFUVandTcutwhile
its intensity is set by the parameter rpk2
21. After experimenting
with diﬀerent shapes and positions for the second peak, it was
found that the presence of a deep valley at ≃35eVincreased
the heating rate due to He+photoionization, hence generating a
higher plasma temperature (i.e., a higher ROIIIratio).Fig. 6. Dereddened NLR ratios of [O iii]/Hβvs.ROIIIfor the same ob-
servational dataset as in Fig.4. Two ionization parameter s equences of
isochoric photoionization calculations with a frontal den sity of no

(yellow) SED. A square identiﬁes the Uo=0.1 model. The third ioniza-
tion parameter sequence (black dotted line) assumed the dou ble-peaked
La3
⋆SED described in Sect. 7.1. Overlaid are two density sequenc es of
isochoric photoionization models along which the density no

in steps of 0.5 dex, both having the same Uo=0.3 value but assuming
either the La3
⋆SED (cyan solid line) or the accretion disk SED (light-
green dashed line) from the OPTXAGN routine.
After comparing the plasma temperatures reached when dif-
ferent combinations of the parameters Tcut,αFUVandrpk2
21were
considered, BK23 concluded that the optimal position for th e
second peak is≈200eVin order that the ROIIIratio from pho-
toionization models reach the observed values. Moving it to
higher values was not an option as it generated an excessive
ﬂux in the soft X-rays that is not observed in Type II AGNs. The
height of the peak is set by the scaling parameter rpk2
21. For a given
value ofαFUV, an increase of rpk2
21orTcutfavors higher values of
ROIII. However, the optimization of the SED parameters must en-
sure that it does not generate an excessive ﬂux beyond 500 eV i n
the soft X-rays.
The ﬁrst SED described by BK23, labeled La1
⋆, assumes
the valueαFUV= + 0.3, which is similar to the standard
Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk model17(Shakura & Sunyaev
1973; Pringle 1981; Cheng et al. 2019) with αFUV=1/3. The
optimized values of the other parameters were Tcut=1.6 106K
with a scaling factor rpk2
21=0.08. IncreasingαFUV resulted in
a narrower second peak, which prevents having a conﬂict with
the soft-X ray observational limits. The second SED propose d
by BK23, La2
⋆, assumed a much larger αFUVof+3. In order that
the second peak occurred at essentially the same energy as in the
previous SED, the parameter Tcuthad to be reduced to 0 .5 106K
with a scaling parameter rpk2
21of 0.001.
17In BK23, this value was erroneously qualiﬁed as equivalent t o the
αUVassumed by Ri14 and Fg97, which is αFUV=−0.3.

7.1.1. Calculations using the double-bump SED La3
⋆
For the current work, we opted for an intermediate case where
αFUV=+1.0. The resulting SED is labeled La3
⋆in Fig. 5 (cyan
solid line). The optimized values for the other parameters a re
Tcut=1.0 106K with a scaling factor rpk2
21=0.03. These pa-
rameter values ensured that the predicted ﬂux beyond 500 eV
did not exceed the soft X-rays measurements. For illustrati ve
purposes, we show in Fig. 5 the average soft excess component
observed with XMM-Newton (magenta line) by Piconcelli et al .
(2005, hereafter Pi05). It corresponds to the best-ﬁt avera ge of 13
quasars with z<0.4 using the parameters from Table 5 of Pi05,
as described in Haro-Corzo et al. (2007). It has been rescale d so
as to reproduce an αOXof−1.35 with respect to the ﬁrst bump.
We note that the dotted section below 600 eVis speculative as it
is not reliably constrained by the X-ray measurements.
Usingmappingsi , we calculated an ionizing parameter se-
quence assuming a constant density of 102cm−3and the same
metallicities as deﬁned in Sect. 6.1. The models are represe nted
by the black dotted line in Fig. 6, which shows that the double
bump SED has the potential of reproducing the observed ROIII
ratios. The Heii/Hβratio from this sequence is 0.27, which is
close to the mean value of 0.24 from the S7 sample in Table 1.
In order to extend our models to Type I AGNs (open gray
symbols), we calculated a density sequence along which the
density increases in steps of 0.5 dex, from no
H=102up to
107cm−3. These calculations are represented by the cyan solid
line in Fig. 6. We selected Uo=0.3 in order that the models
cover the upper envelope of the quasar [O iii]/Hβratios. Among
quasars, the vertical dispersion in the observed [O iii]/Hβratios
is signiﬁcant. It suggests a signiﬁcant range in plasma exci ta-
tion, which can be accounted for using lower values of Uoor
dual-density models as explored by BL05.
7.1.2. Possible origin of the double-peak SED
Given that a double-peak SED can solve the [O iii] TE problem,
it is worth exploring how such a distribution might actually arise
in the central regions of quasars. The pertinence of a second peak
to describe the harder UV component is provided by studies th at
attempt to explain the soft X-ray excess in AGNs. Two di ﬀerent
processes have been proposed to explain this feature.
The ﬁrst one postulates the presence of relativistic blurre d
reﬂection by ionized plasma (e.g., Ross & Fabian 2005). We
note that this mechanism is exactly the same one as proposed
by La12, producing a second peak near 40 eV. However, in this
case, the relativistic clouds reﬂecting the disk emission n eed to
be much hotter, with a high degree of ionization, in order to e x-
tend its blurred reﬂection all the way up to the soft X-ray ban d.
As such, these models have the potential to explain at the sam e
time the presence of a second peak near 200 eV, and the soft
X-ray excess.
The second mechanism besought to explain the soft X-ray
excess proposes comptonization of the accretion disk seed p ho-
tons by a dual-coronal system (e.g., Done et al. 2012). In thi s
self-consistent accretion model (referred to as OPTXAGN), the
primary emission from the disk becomes partly comptonized b y
an optically thick warm plasma, forming the extreme EUV as
well as the soft excess. An example of an OPTXAGN model is
represented in Fig. 5 by the light-green dashed curve (see BK 23
for more details). The OPTXAGN SED can successfully repro-
duce the observed ROIIIratio, as shown by the light-green dashed
line in Fig. 6, which is a density sequence of isochoric photo ion-
ization models similar to the previous La3
⋆calculations. Thereare other sets of parameters in the OPTXAGN model that can
match our double-peak SEDs, however, they require extreme a c-
cretion rates (L/LEdd≥1) that are not proper of Type II objects
discussed in this work.
Despite these drawbacks, we note the striking similarity of
the OPTXAGN SED with that of La3
⋆, considering that they were
built independently and with completely di ﬀerent scientiﬁc mo-
tivations. Overall, we ﬁnd it remarkable that the two most po pu-
lar mechanisms to explain the presence of the soft X-ray exce ss
(blurred reﬂection or warm comptonization) might also prod uce
in a natural way the double-peak SED needed to explain the ob-
served ROIIIratios.
7.2. High ionization matter-bounded clouds
Another possibility which beneﬁts from photoionization of He+
consists in high ionization matter-bounded clouds (hereaf ter
MB) as was proposed in the modeling of the NLR and ENLR
spectra by BWS, Stasi ´nska (1984), Viegas & Prieto (1992) and
Morganti et al. (1991). In their models, BWS truncated the ph o-
toionization models at a depth close to the position where mo st
photons with energies above the ionization potential of He+
(54.4 eV) have been absorbed. They considered an ionizing con-
tinuum consisting of a power law with Fν∝ν−1.3. In the
current work, we adopt the thermal distribution of Fg97 with
Tcut=106K (long-dash line in Fig. 5). Similarly to BWS, our
photoionization models were truncated at a depth which is de -
ﬁned by the fraction FMBof the ionizing photons that has been
absorbed. We found that calculations with FMB=0.45 can re-
produce the observed ROIIIratios of the S7 sample as indicated
below.
7.2.1. Radiation pressure stratiﬁed MB component
Rather than assuming an isochoric or isobaric density proﬁl e for
the MB component, we considered the e ﬀect of radiation pres-
sure on the high ionization regions. As shown in Binette et al .
(1997); Binette (1998); Dopita et al. (2002), radiation pre ssure
exerted by the progressive absorption of the ionizing photo ns
can induce a density gradient within the photoionized slabs .
Binette et al. (1997) has indicated that for high Uovalues, the
density averaged ionization parameter ¯Uacross the photoionized
slab tended asymptotically toward a constant value where th e in-
tegrated line ratios to a ﬁrst order became insensitive to Uo. One
important parameter that must be deﬁned is FMB, the fraction of
ionizing photons absorbed within MB clouds. Our selected va lue
was inferred from the no
H=102cm−3MB calculation by deter-
mining at which depth ( FMB) the integrated ROIIIratio reached
0.015, the average ratio observed among the S7 Seyfert 2 sam-
ple. We found that the truncation of the MB component should
take place at FMB=0.45, a similar value to that of BWS of 0.40.
The resulting MB component is represented by the blue con-
tinuous line in Fig. 7 along which the frontal density no
Hsuc-
cessively increases in steps of 0.5 dex, starting at 102cm−3. The
gray dotted line shows the calculated line ratios if the same pho-
toionization models were ionization-bounded rather than M B. In
this case, the ROIIIratios are signiﬁcantly lower than the S7 blue
circle positioned at 10−1.836, except for the high density models
owing to collisional deexcitation.
The matter-bounded component cannot account for the lower
excitation emission lines and an additional emission compo -
nent is required. BWS explored the possibility of combining
the emission spectra from both a matter-bounded (MB) and
Article number, page 14 of 21Luc Binette et al.: Constraints on the densities and tempera ture of Seyfert 2 NLR
an ionization-bounded (IB) component. The relative propor -
tion of both components is set by the parameter AM/I. As in
BWS, we hypothesized that the radiation which photoionizes
the ionization-bounded clouds corresponds to the UV radiat ion
which escapes unabsorbed from the MB component, which lies
closer to the ionizing source.
For the IB clouds, we assumed a frontal density larger by a
factor ten (i.e., 10×no
Hfrom the MB model) and a smaller geo-
metrical dilution factor of 5 ×10−2for the ionizing radiation that
escapes the MB component. This is equivalent to having the IB
clouds at a larger radial distance from the AGN by a factor of√
20 with respect to the MB clouds. Since the radiation pressur e
exerted on the IB component is negligible, we assumed the iso -
baric prescription. The line ratios behavior as a function o f the
outer density no
Hof the IB component is represented by the pur-
ple dashed line in Fig. 7. Because the IB component generates
relatively little [Oiii] emission, the integrated ROIIIratio comes
out primarily from the MB component.
7.2.2. Models that combine both the MB and IB components
In our approach, the relative proportion of MB and IB clouds i s
determined by the parameter AM/I, which represents the ratio of
the solid angle subtended by the MB clouds, as seen from the
ionizing source, to the solid angle subtended by the IB cloud s.
The line ratio Ri
seqfor any line ialong an AM/Isequence is ob-
tained using the formula:
Ri
seq=Ri
IB+CM/IAM/IRi
MB
1+CM/IAM/I(3)
where Ri
MBandRi
IBare the line ratios relative to H βfrom the MB
and IB components, respectively. By convention, the value o f the
scaling parameter CM/Iis such that at AM/I=1, the MB and IB
components contribute in equal proportions to the H βluminos-
ity. In Fig. 7, the near vertical short-dash lines illustrat es how the
line ratios behave as one varies the AM/Iparameter, which takes
on successive values of 10, 3.0, 1.0, 0.30 and 0.10, from top t o
bottom. A dot identiﬁes each AM/Ivalue while an open circle
distinguishes the AM/I=3 model in each sequence. To avoid
confusion, the AM/Isequences with no
H=102and 102.5cm−3
were left out as they partially overlay the leftmost sequenc es.
The two sequences with no
H=103(light-cyan) and 103.5cm−3
(light-green) are those that best reproduce the S7 average ROIII
ratio, assuming AM/I=3 as required to ﬁt the observed [O iii]/Hβ
ratio. The MB component in this case is reprocessing ≃75% of
the absorbed ionizing radiation.
TheROIIIratios observed among the S7 survey Seyfert 2s fa-
vor MB models with no
H<∼103.5cm−3where collisional deex-
citation is not signiﬁcant, which allows us to directly infe r the
plasma temperature. By comparison, the Type I AGNs measure-
ments of BL05 and RA00 (open circles and triangles) imply
much larger densities, above 105cm−3in most cases. A posi-
tive aspect of the MB +IB sequences is that the integrated [Ar iv]
(λ4711Å/λ4740Å) ratios of the AM/I=3 models with no
H=
103and 103.5cm−3resulted in values of 1.0 and 0.68, respec-
tively, which is within the range of observed values among th e
Seyfert 2s of Table 2 (Col. 9). Furthermore, the temperature sen-
sitive [Nii] (λ5755Å/λ6583Å) ratio was calculated to be 0.013
and 0.021 for the same two models, while the mean ratio value
for our Seyfert 2 sample is 0 .020±0.006 according to the mea-
surements of Thomas et al. (2017).
One objection to the proposed MB +IB calculations is the
predicted Heii/Hβratio which was calculated to be He ii/Hβ=Fig. 7. Dereddened NLR ratios of [O iii]/Hβvs.ROIIIfor the same obser-
vational dataset as in Fig.4. The blue solid line represent t he sequence
of MB models in which the frontal densities varied from no
H=102up
to 107cm−3, in steps of of 0.5 dex, assuming in all cases Uo=0.1.
The gray dotted line represents photoionization models tha t assumed
the same parameters as the MB sequence except that the models are
ionization-bounded. In both sequences the cloud internal d ensity is
stratiﬁed due to the pressure exerted by absorption of the io nizing con-
tinuum. The purple line represents the density sequence for the IB
component in which the ionizing continuum consisted of the r adiation
(further diluted by a factor 20) which leaks out from the back of the
MB clouds. In all calculations, the assumed ionizing contin uum cor-
responded to the thermal distribution of Fg97 with Tcut=106K. The
eight (near vertical) short-dash lines correspond to a line ar combination
of the MB model of density no
Hwith the IB model with density 10 no
H.
The proportion between the two components was set by the para meter
AM/I, which successively took on the values of 10, 3, 1, 0.3 and 0.1 . A
circle identiﬁes models with AM/I=3. To avoid confusion due to the
close superposition of the low density sequences, the AM/Isequences
with no
H=102and 102.5cm−3were left out.
0.65 while the average observed ratio among the S7 sample of
Table 1 is 0.243±0.072. This was not an issue for the MB +IB
models of BWS, essentially because the assumed ionizing SED
consisted of a power law of index −1.3 rather than the thermal
SED of Fg97, which peaks at 60 eV. Another concern is the re-
quired ﬁne tuning of some parameters such as FMB, the density
of the IB emission component or the dilution factor of the ion iz-
ing radiation reaching the IB component.
7.3. Temperature inhomogeneities within the NLR
In Planetary Nebulae and H ii-regions, the plasma temperatures
inferred from the [O iii] (λ4363Å/λ5007Å) ratio are signiﬁcantly
higher than the values inferred from recombination lines of
O+2. For instance, the measurements of these lines in 20 PNe
by Peimbert et al. (2014) indicate that the temperatures inf erred
from the ROIIIratio were≈28 % higher on average than the tem-
peratures that were inferred from the ratio of the observed O iiV1
Article number, page 15 of 21A&A proofs: manuscript no. aanda
integrated multiplet18with respect to the [O iii]λλ4959,5007Å
lines. This phenomenon was ascribed to the existence of tem-
perature ﬂuctuations (that is, inhomogeneities) permeati ng the
nebulae. Using the nomenclature of Peimbert (1967, 1995), t he
mean nebular temperature ¯T0of a nebula characterized by small
temperature ﬂuctuations t2can be deﬁned as:
¯T0=/integraltext

rms amplitude tof the temperature ﬂuctuations is given by

The values of t2derived by Peimbert et al. (2014) from their PNe
sample covered the range of 0.035 to 0.128. In the case of AGN,
the detection of recombination lines from O+2so far has not
been possible owing to the weakness of the lines in relation t o
the bright underlying AGN continuum. For the PNe studied by
Peimbert et al. (2014), the integrated luminosity of the O iiV1
multiplet was rather weak, typically <0.2 % of the [Oiii] 5007Å
line. For plasma densities <104cm−3, the multiplet ﬂuxes are
distributed (although nonuniformly) among the eight O iirecom-
bination lines, which may explain why they so far have not bee n
detected in AGNs. As an exercise, we have explored the possi-
bility of having temperature ﬂuctuations within the NLR and an-
alyzed whether they may be related to the TE problem describe d
in Sect. 6. Assuming that the temperature ﬂuctuations as inf erred
by various authors in the case of H ii-regions (e.g., Peimbert et al.
1995; Esteban et al. 1998; Rola & Stasi ´nska 1994) were caused
by an additional albeit unknown heating agent, we proceeded to
quantify the energy contribution required from this heatin g pro-
cess in order that the observed ROIIIvalues could be reproduced.
As described in Binette & Luridiana (2000, hereafter BL00),
the codemappingsi oﬀers the option of calculating the impact of
temperature ﬂuctuations on the emission lines from a photoi on-
ized nebula. In photoionization calculations, it is custom ary to
deﬁne and use at every point in the nebula a local equilibrium
temperature, Teq, which satisﬁes the condition that the cooling
by radiative processes equals the heating due to the photoel ectric
eﬀect. In our hot spots scheme, by construction, Teqcorresponds
to the temperature ﬂoor above which take place all the ﬂuctu-
ations. It deﬁnes the null energy expense when calculating t he
extra energy emitted as a result of the small scale hot spots. The
procedure consists ﬁrst in deﬁning a mean temperature ¯T0which
is derived from the computed local equilibrium temperature Teq.
The following expression was adopted by BL00
¯T0≃Teq[1+γ(γ−1)t2/2]−1/γ. (6)
The simulation of the temperature ﬂuctuations adopted by BL 00
and shown in their Fig. 1 favored a value of γ=−15 , which
is the appropriate value for any distribution of ﬂuctuation s that
resembles those depicted in BL00. Subsequently, each emiss ion
18The OiiV1 multiplet consists of eight recombination emission line s
at the wavelengths of 4651, 4673, 4638, 4462, 4696, 4642, 467 6 and
4649Å, respectively. The integrated luminosity of the whol e multiplet is
insensitive to the electronic density (Peimbert et al. 2014 ; Storey et al.
2014).Fig. 8. Dereddened NLR ratios of [O iii]/Hβvs.ROIIIfor the same ob-
servational dataset as in Fig.4. The gray dotted line consis ts of radiation

ing the Fg97 SED with Tcut=106K. The frontal density along the
sequence varies from no
H=102up to 107cm−3, in steps of of 0.5 dex,
as in Fig. 7. The blue continuous line corresponds to a simila r density
sequence but assuming the presence of temperature ﬂuctuati ons at the
level of t2=0.15. The light-green arrows describe the change in ROIII
ratios for the models with frontal densities of no

respectively.
line was calculated using Teqand multiplied by a correction fac-
tor due to the ﬂuctuations. In the case of recombination line s the
intensity, Irec, of a given line is a ﬀected by a factor
Irec∝¯Tα
0[1+α(α−1)t2/2]. (7)
This expression, which can be used to compute individual re-
combination line intensities in the presence of small ﬂuctu ations,
is equivalent to calculating the intensity (which is propor tional to
Tα) using the eﬀective temperature ¯Trecrather than Teq
¯Trec=∝angbracketleftTα∝angbracketright1/α≃T0[1+α(α−1)t2/2]1/α. (8)
As shown by Peimbert (1995, and references therein), tem-
perature ﬂuctuations have in general much less impact on rec om-
bination than on collisional processes which are usually go v-
erned by the exponential factor. For this reason, we adopted the
simpliﬁcation of considering a single value of α=−0.83 for all
recombination processes (such αis the appropriate value for the
Hβline at 10000 K). This approximation allowed us to use a sin-
gle temperature ¯Trecwhen solving for the ionization balance of
H, He and all ions of metals.
To calculate the forbidden line intensities, we solve for th e
population of each excited state of all ions of interest, ass uming
a system of ﬁve or more levels according to the ion. In the case
of intercombination, ﬁne structure and resonance lines, we treat
those as simple two level systems. More speciﬁcally, when ev al-
uating the excitation ( ∝Tβi jexp[−∆Ei j/kT]) and deexcitation
(∝Tβji) rates of a given multilevel ion, each rate i j(population)

in the case of deexcitation. These factors result in general in
an enhancement of the collisional rates in the presence of te m-
perature inhomogeneities. They are adapted from the work of
Peimbert (1995) and were applied to all collisionally excit ed
transitions. If we consider a similar distribution of the ﬂu ctua-
tions as assumed by BL00, the mean recombination temperatur e
¯Trecderived using Eq. 8 lies slightly below ¯T0. Inspection of the
line ratios calculated with mappingsi using ¯T0and the above cor-
rection factors conﬁrmed that the higher is ∆Ei jthe higher the
line intensity enhancement (at constant t2). It can be shown on
the other hand that the far infrared lines (or any transition for
which exp[−∆Ei j/kT]≈1) are less aﬀected by the ﬂuctuations,
similarly to the recombination lines.
Assuming a metallicity of 2.5 Z⊙and the thermal ionizing
distribution of Fg97 with Tcut=106K (long-dash line in Fig. 5),
we explored the impact of varying the ﬂuctuations amplitude t2
until the observed ROIIIof 0.015 in Seyfert 2s could be repro-
duced. We found that a value of t2≈0.15 was required, as shown
by the solid blue line in Fig. 8. Interestingly, it coincides with
the upper end value inferred by Méndez-Delgado et al. (2023) in
their study of extragalactic H iiregions.
We evaluated the extra energy required to generate the tem-
perature ﬂuctuations and found that the integrated cooling rate of
the plasma with t2=0.15 was 50% higher than when the equi-
librium temperature Teqis assumed19, which is an uncomfort-
ably large fraction. To conﬁrm the hypothesis of small scale NLR
temperature inhomogeneities would in any case require obse rva-
tions of the weak recombinations lines of O iias was achieved in
PNe and Hiiregions. A possibility could be deep spectroscopy
of the radially distant ENLR associated to radio-galaxies s uch
as in Pks 2152-69 (Tadhunter et al. 1987) where the underlyin g
stellar emission is weak and only a dust-reﬂected AGN contin -
uum is present.
7.4. Non-Maxwellian energy distributions
Another possibility to reach higher ROIIIvalues is to consider a
κ-distribution of the electron kinetic energy rather than th e stan-
dard Maxwell-Boltzmann (hereafter M-B) energy distributi on.
One advantage of this approach is that it does not require an a d-
ditional heating mechanism as was the case with the temperat ure
ﬂuctuations considered in Sect. 7.3. What is needed, howeve r, is
a mechanism that could account for the distortion of the kine tic
energies of the electrons.
7.4.1. Context of kappa vs. M-B distributions
The assumption that the velocity distribution of the free el ec-
trons in gaseous nebulae are described by a M-B distribution
is based on the electron thermalization timescale. It is usu ally
19This corresponds to a Γheatvalue of 0.5 as deﬁned by Eqn. 12 of
BL00.assumed that free electrons share their energy with the neig h-
bouring medium so rapidly that they become thermalized be-
fore they excite any emission line. This is assumed because t he
energy redistribution through elastic collisions of elect rons oc-
curs faster than any other process (e.g., Draine & Kreisch 20 18).
However, if energetic electrons are injected into the gas co n-
tinually and suﬃciently quickly that the particle distribution
does not have time to relax to a classical equilibrium distri -
bution, thenκ-distributions may arise. Although κ-distributions
were initially criticized for lacking a theoretical justiﬁ cation,
Tsallis et al. (1996) showed how these distributions can app ear
using entropy considerations and it has also been shown that they
can arise from Tsallis’s non-extensive statistical mechan ics (e.g.,
Leubner 2002; Livadiotis & McComas 2009). For a review on κ-
distributions and on the mechanisms proposed to generate th em
in space plasmas, see Pierrard & Lazar (2010).
Nicholls et al. (2012) proposed various mechanisms that
could induce and maintain a κ-distribution within photoion-
ized regions. These include the injection of a population of
energetic electrons by acceleration mechanisms such as mag -
netic reconnection and development of inertial Alfvén wave s,
shocks, and the injection of high-energy electrons through the
photoionization process. Energetic electrons can be produ ced
by the photoionization of dust (Dopita & Sutherland 2000), a nd
X-ray or EUV photoionization (Shull & van Steenberg 1985;
Petrini & da Silva 1997). Active galactic nuclei are regions
where shocks, winds, and turbulence are known to be present
(e.g., Baring 1991; Humphrey et al. 2008, 2010; Zhang et al.
2013; Silva et al. 2018), and these processes may also be suf-
ﬁcient to accelerate particles and generate a κ-distribution of
electron energies. Several other processes, which are plau sibly
associated with AGN activity, may also be responsible for de -
viations from equilibrium, such as ionization by cosmic ray s
(Giammanco & Beckman 2005), and dissipative turbulence in-
ternal to the gas clouds (Mignoli et al. 2019).
7.4.2. Calculations assuming a κ-distribution
Electronκ-distributions have been directly measured in sev-
eral solar system plasmas. They are present in the solar wind
(e.g., Gloeckler et al. 1992; Maksimovic et al. 1997), in the outer
heliosphere and the inner heliosleath (e.g., Decker & Krimi gis
2003; Heerikhuisen et al. 2008), in planetary magnetospher es,
including magnetosheath (e.g., Gloeckler & Hamilton 1987;
Krimigis et al. 1983, 1986; Olbert 1968), and in magnetosphe res
of planetary moons (e.g., Jurac et al. 2002; Moncuquet et al.
2002).
Although it is apparent that κ-distributions are prevalent in
solar system plasmas, but not until recent years has the pos-
sibility ofκ-distributions in extrasolar gaseous nebulae been
signiﬁcantly explored. This possibility was investigated by
Nicholls et al. (2012, hereafter Ni12), Binette et al. (2012 , here-
after BM12) and Dopita et al. (2013) in the context of stellar -
ionized gas. Morais et al. (2021) have recently compared pho -
toionization models assuming a κ-distribution with the observed
line ratios from a sample of 143 Type 2 AGNs. They found that
for 98 objects,κ-distributions provide a better ﬁt than M-B dis-
tributions.
In order to calculate the impact of a κ-distribution on our
photoionization models, we used the analytical treatment d evel-
oped by Ni12 and subsequently implemented in mappingsi (see
Binette et al. (2012) for details). Apart from taking into ac count
the increased excitation rates of the atomic levels and the r e-
combination rates of ionized species, mappingsi also calculates

the enhancement of collisional ionization that can result f rom
κ-distributions.
Using the same metallicity as in previous models, we cal-
culated a density sequence of ionization-bounded photoion iza-
tion calculations assuming Uo=0.1 and the thermal distribution
of Fg97 with Tcut=106K as ionizing continuum. The density
sequence calculations assuming κ=7 for the electron veloc-
ity distribution (see Eq. 1 in Ni12) is represented by the bla ck
solid line in Fig. 9 while the gray dotted line corresponds to the
same density sequence of M-B ionization-bounded models fro m
Fig. 7 (i.e.,κ=∞). In both sequences the clouds internal den-
sity is stratiﬁed due to the progressive absorption of the io nizing
continuum (see Sect. 7.2.1).
The three light-green dashed arrows in Fig. 9 illustrate the
change in line ratios for speciﬁc models of the M-B sequence
(gray dotted line) when one assumes a κ-distribution withκ=7.
The frontal densities of these models correspond to no
H=102.5,
103.0and 103.5cm−3, respectively. They result in an [Ar iv]
(λ4711Å/λ4740Å) line ratio of 1.13, 0.87 and 0.54, respectively,
which are representative of the observed ratios among the S7
Seyfert 2s (Col. 9 in Table 2).
Owing to radiation pressure, the mean densities of the zones
which emit the [Ar iv] lines is≈5×no
H. Interestingly, even
though the integrated H Balmer line luminosities are not a ﬀected
byκ(as they only depend on the ﬂux of impinging ionizing pho-
tonsφ0) the integrated columns of ionized H+in the three models
withκ=7 turned out 25% lower because the H+recombination
rates are 25% higher than with the M-B models.
To conclude, the models with κ≃7 and densities no
H<
104cm−3can reproduce the observed [Ar iv] and ROIIIratios.Also, owing to the higher cooling e ﬃciency of the models that
assumeκ-distributions, the average plasma temperature for the
no
H=103cm−3model is actually lower, by about 1100 K, than
the same model assuming a M-B distribution (i.e., κ=∞).
Morais et al. (2021) has performed a more detailed compari-
son of the M-B distribution models with those that assume a κ-
distribution. Their analysis consisted in exploring di ﬀerent val-
ues for the ionization parameter, the continuum spectral in dex,
the plasma density and its metallicity. For a majority of obj ects
from their 143 Type II AGNs sample, their analysis favored th e
κ-distribution approach.
We consider thatκ-distributions have the potential of resolv-
ing the TE problem. We must emphasize, however, that if κ-
distributions applied to the NLR, the observed ROIIIratio can
no more serve as temperature indicator. The three κ=7 models
with densities similar to those inferred from the S7 sample s how
an average plasma temperature of ≈10 300 rather than the pre-
viously inferred value of 13 000 K (Sect. 4) based on a standar d
M-B distribution.
8. Summary and conclusions
Following a brief review of previous studies about the den-
sities encountered in both the NLR and ENLR emission re-
gions (Sect. 2), we are proposing the utilization of the [Ar iv]
(λ4711Å/λ4740Å) doublet ratio to evaluate to what extent the
temperatures derived from the [O iii] (λ4363Å/λ5007Å) ratios of
the NLR are aﬀected by collisional deexcitation. Our Seyfert 2
sample was originally extracted from the ﬁnal data release
(Dopita et al. 2015; Thomas et al. 2017) of the Siding Spring
Southern Seyfert Spectroscopic Snapshot Survey. Since our
analysis centers on measurements of very weak lines, we foun d
necessary to repeat the line extraction and line ﬁtting proc edure
to ensure that the stellar spectral features surrounding th e [Ariv]
λλ4711,40Å lines were properly subtracted and also to deter-
mine which aperture provided the best S /N ratio for the extracted
lines (i.e., 1′′or 4′′).
We extracted reliable NLR measurements of the [Ar iv] dou-
blet in 16 high excitation Seyfert 2s of the S7 survey. The [Ar iv]
λ4711Å line ﬂuxes were subsequently corrected for blending
due to the weaker He iλ4713Å and [Neiv]λλ4715Å lines.
Among our sample, 13 Seyfert 2s cluster at a similar ROIIIra-
tio of 0.0146±0.0020 while three objects labeled outliers show
signiﬁcantly higher values ( >0.03). The plasma densities in-
ferred from the [Ar iv] doublet for the 13 Seyfert 2s group span
over the range 2.4103to 5.4104cm−3in the single density case
(Table 2). The average temperature derived from ROIIIfor the
13 objects is 13 000 ±703 K. Alternatively, when for each ob-
ject a decreasing power-law density distribution is assume d that
extends up to a cut-o ﬀdensity ncut, the averaged values of the
plasma densities that we infer for each object all turn out lo wer
than 6.7×104cm−3(Table 3). The average temperature derived
from ROIIIin this case is 12 961 ±711 K, which is similar to the
single density case.
Assuming the thermal SED of Fg97 with Tcut=106.0K
(Fig. 5) and a gas metallicity of 2.5 Z⊙, which is within the range
expected for galactic nuclei of spiral galaxies, the photoi oniza-
tion models assuming low densities calculated with mappingsi
could not reproduce the observed ROIIIratios, which we labeled
the TE problem. We subsequently addressed this issue by expl or-
ing alternative mechanisms that could account for the obser ved
ROIIIratios while assuming plasma densities that encompassed
those inferred from the [Ar iv] doublet. For instance, in order
Article number, page 18 of 21Luc Binette et al.: Constraints on the densities and tempera ture of Seyfert 2 NLR
to reproduce an ROIIIratio close to the observed mean value of
0.015, we considered four mechanisms as follows. In Sect. 7. 1,
we explored the possibility of a double-bump SED where the
second peak occurs near 200 eV . One advantage of this method i s
that it can also account for the soft X-ray excess observed by the
XMM-Newton satellite. In Sect. 7.2, we explored the possibi lity
of high ionization matter-bounded clouds. Although a promi s-
ing solution, the calculated He ii/Hβratio was much higher than
observed, by a factor 2.4. In Sect. 7.3, following the approa ch
of BL00, we hypothesized the existence of signiﬁcant temper -
ature inhomogeneities within the NLR clouds. To conﬁrm this
proposition would require the detection of the O iiV1 multiplet.
Finally, in Sect. 7.4 we considered the possibility of a κelec-
tron energy distribution, with κ=7. One advantage of this ap-
proach was that it did not require an additional heating mech a-
nism although the immediate cause of the distortion of the M- B
electron velocities remained indeterminate. We note that i f the
κ-distribution mechanism was conﬁrmed, the ROIIIratio would
no more serve as a direct temperature diagnostics.
Independently of the origin of the TE problem, the fact re-
mains that Type I and Type II AGNs reveal signiﬁcant di ﬀerences
insofar as the optical [O iii] lines are concerned. There is a clear
demarcation in the [O iii] (λ4363Å/λ5007Å) vs. ROIIIdiagram
of the Seyfert 2’s from the S7 survey with respect to quasars
and narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The most likely interpr eta-
tion is that collisional deexcitation is signiﬁcantly a ﬀecting the
line emission of Type I nuclei where we have full view of the in -
ner NLR and possibly systems at an intermediate orientation as
might be the case for the few outliers of the S7 survey. The cla s-
sical AGN uniﬁed model, which proposes that the NLR should
be isotropic, is clearly an incomplete picture.

Article number, page 20 of 21Luc Binette et al.: Constraints on the densities and tempera ture of Seyfert 2 NLR
Appendix A: Plasma densities inferred from the
[Sii] doublet
Density diagnostics of the NLR typically rely on the [S ii]
λ6716Å/λ6731Å doublet ratio, which originates from the low
ionization plasma. In Seyfert galaxies, the study of Benner t et al.
(2006a,b) for instance reveals densities of the spatially r esolved
ENLR that are typically <103cm−3and in most cases both the
electron density and the ionization parameter appear to be d e-
creasing with radius. More recently, Freitas et al. (2018), who
used the Gemini multiObject Spectrograph Integral Field Un it
(IFU) on the Gemini North Telescope, created two-dimension al
electron density maps of the central part of ﬁve bright nearb y
Seyfert nuclei. These authors found electron density ( ne) values,
inferred from the [S ii]λ6716Å/λ6731Å line ratio, ranging from
∼100 up to∼2500 cm−3along the AGN radius. The spatial reso-
lution quoted in their Table 1 implies a seeing of ∼0.6′′. A com-
plementary work is that of Kakkad et al. (2018) who generated
IFU electron density maps for an AGNs sample issued from the
S7 survey which consisted of seven Seyfert 2 galaxies. The el ec-
tron densities they inferred for the ENLR showed a positive g ra-
dient toward the nucleus, which was ﬁtted with an exponentia l
proﬁle that initiated at a radius beyond the seeing size to av oid
atmospheric blending. The density values they inferred cov ered
the range of 50 to 2000 cm−3. As argued in App. A of BVM,
for the ENLR these density values are probably not far-o ﬀfrom
those characterizing the higher excitation lines such as [O iii].
However, the situation is very di ﬀerent in the case of the unre-
solved NLR of Type I AGNs as shown by BL05 (see Fig. 4b)
who presented clear evidence of strong collisional deexcit ation
of the ROIIIratio.
Appendix B: Correcting the [Ar iv] doublet from line
blending
The observed [Ariv]+line atλ4711Å consists of a blend with
the much weaker He iλ4713Å and [Neiv]λλ4725Å lines. In or-
der to properly determine the plasma densities, one must deb lend
the [Ariv]+(λλλ4711,13,15Å/λ4740Å) ratio of each object. As
in BVM, the deblended [Ar iv] (λ4711Å/λ4740Å) ratio is ob-
tained by subtracting, from the measured doublet [Ar iv]+ratio,
the fractional contribution from the He iλ4713Å line ( fHeI
blend) and
the [Neiv]λλ4715Å line ( fNeIV
blend), that is:
[Ariv]=(1−fHeI
blend−fNeIV
blend)×[Ariv]+
with each blending correction evaluated as follows.
Appendix B.1: Blending of the He iλ4713Å line
One characteristic of ratios involving recombination line s of the
same ion is their limited sensitivity to either temperature or den-
sity. A valid prediction of the He iλ4713Å line intensity can
therefore be derived from the measurement of the He i(λ5876Å
line) (alternatively, one can use the He iλ4471Å line). Our de-
blending procedure is as follows. First, we derive the Case B Hei
(λ4713Å/λ5876Å) ratio, which we label R He, via interpolation
of the emissivities from the supplemental Table of Porter et al.
(2013). For a 104cm−3plasma at a temperature of 12 000 K, the
RHeratio turns out to be only 4.78% of He i5876Å. Tempera-
ture variations of±2000 K would cause a change in this ratio of
+7.95
−11.5%, respectively, while adopting density values in the inter val
102to 105cm−3would result in R Heratios between 0.0429 and0.0489, respectively. Second, by deﬁning RHe/Aras the observed
Hei/[Ariv] (λ5876Å/λ4740Å) ratio, the product (R He×RHe/Ar)
deﬁnes our estimate of fHeI
blend, which is the contribution from He i
λ4713Å blending to the "measured" [Ar iv]+doublet ratio. The
fHeI
blendvalues for the S7 survey assuming a single density are
shown in Col. 6 of Table 2.
Appendix B.2: Blending of the [Ne iv]λλ4715Å line.
The [Neiv] optical lines consist of a quadruplet at
λ4714.36,λ4715.80,λ4724.15 andλ4726.62Å, respec-
tively (García-Rojas et al. 2015). To simplify the notation ,
we refer to the quadruplet as consisting of two doublets:
the observed [Ne iv]λλ4725Å doublet and the potentially
blended [Neiv]λλ4715Å doublet. At typical NLR densities
and temperatures, the observed [Ne iv]λλ4725Å doublet turns
out to be≈35% brighter than the blended [Ne iv]λλ4715Å
doublet. The dependence of this ratio on temperature and
densities is relatively minor. Within the S7 survey, we coul d
detect theλλ4715Å doublet only in a few objects. To correct
the measured [Ar iv]+ratio from [Neiv] blending, we ﬁrst
calculate at the appropriate density and temperature the [N eiv]
(λλ4715Å/λλ4725Å) ratio, which we label R Ne. By deﬁning
RNe/Aras the observed [Ne iv]/[Ariv] (λλ4725Å/λ4740Å) ratio,
the product (R Ne×RNe/Ar) deﬁnes our estimate of fNeIV
blend, which
is the contribution from [Ne iv] blending to the "measured"
[Ariv]+doublet ratio.
Appendix C: Recent updates to the code
MAPPINGS Ig
We incorporated the following recombination emission line pro-
cesses to the version ig ofmappingsi .
Appendix C.1: Emission resulting from recombination of N+2,
O+3, O+2and S+3to metastable levels
Based on the work of Pequignot et al. (1991), the recombinati on
rates from N+2, O+3and O+2to the corresponding metastable
levels1S0and1D2of [Nii] and [Oiii] and levels2Pand2Dof
[Oii], respectively, have been incorporated in the calculation of
the corresponding emission line intensities. In the case of the1S0
level of [Oiii], we added the missing contribution from dielec-
tronic recombination (Christophe Morisset, private commu nica-
tion). As for the S+2and S+3ions, we estimated their recombina-
tion rates to metastable levels by extrapolation from the O+2and
O+3ions as follows: we assumed that the fraction, ξ, of the to-
tal recombination rate ( αrec
SIIorαrec
SIII), which populates metastable
levels of Sulfur is the same fraction as found for Oxygen. For in-
stance, for a 10 000 K plasma this fraction, ξS0
OIII, in the case of
level1S0of Oiii(causing emission of the [O iii]λ4363Å line), is
2.2% ofαrec
OIV.
