Abstract
The cumulants of baryon number fluctuations serve as a good probe for experimentally
exploring the QCD phase diagram at finite density, giving rise to characteristic fluctuation
patterns associated with a possible critical endpoint (CEP). We compute the higher-order
baryon number susceptibilities at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential using a
holographic QCD model to address the non-perturbative aspect of strongly coupled QCD
matter. The model can accurately confront lattice QCD data on a quantitative level and the
location of the CEP is found to fall within the range accessible to upcoming experimental
measurements. The baryon number susceptibilities up to the twelfth order are computed,
and the collision energy dependence of different ratios of these susceptibilities is examined
along the chemical freeze-out line. The holographic results show quantitative agreement
with experimental data and the functional renormalization group results in a large collision
energy range, with all ratios exhibiting a peak structure around 5-10 GeV. The mismatching
between our holographic results with experimental data for sufficiently low collision energy
is possibly due to non-equilibrium effects and complex experimental environments. The
future experiments with measurements in the low collision energy range√SNN≈1−
10 GeV and reduced experimental uncertainty could reveal more non-monotonic behavior
signals which can be used to locate the CEP.

1 Introduction
Obtaining a quantitative understanding of the QCD phase diagram at finite temperature T
and baryon chemical potential µBremains remarkably challenging due to the strongly coupled
nature of the system under extreme conditions. Significant efforts have been devoted to this
problem over the past few decades. Lattice QCD, formulated on a grid of points in space and
time, provides reliable information from first principles at small µBwhere the sign problem
does not hinder numerical calculations. Lattice QCD calculations indicate that the chiral and
confinement/deconfinement phase transitions likely occur as an analytic crossover for small µB,
with mixing of the transitions [1–3]. On the other hand, several effective theories, including
the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) [4–9], the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model [10–13], and
the functional renormalization group (FRG) [14–16], suggest the existence of a first-order phase
transition at large µB, which would terminate at a critical point known as the QCD critical
endpoint (CEP). However, the exact location of the CEP is still a matter of debate, with no
conclusive constraints from any model calculations thus far. Nevertheless, lattice QCD results
disfavor the existence of the CEP for µB/T≤3 and µB<300 MeV [17–22].
The critical physics associated with the CEP is expected to have a localized impact in its
vicinity [23]. Numerous theoretical studies have revealed intriguing non-trivial patterns in the
ratios of conserved charge distributions Cnaround the CEP [12,16,24–30]. Non-monotonic vari-
ations of conserved charge fluctuations with respect to the TandµBalong the phase boundary
could arise from critical physics in the vicinity of a CEP which can serve as signals for CEP [31].
Experimental measurement has suggested a significant overlap between the chemical freeze-out
region and the crossover region for µB/T≤3 [32], implying that the freeze-out line is likely
to pass through the vicinity of the CEP, provided that the CEP is not far beyond µB/T≈3.
This indicates that Cnand their ratios along the chemical freeze-out line may take similar non-
monotonic behavior [12, 16, 26, 28–30, 33–35]. Remarkably, these ratios can be directly linked
to measurable quantities in experiments, such as the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis,
2making it feasible to locate the CEP by measuring cumulants of conserved charge distributions
in experimental studies.
Indeed, the potential existence of the CEP and the first-order phase transition has motivated
dedicated experimental programs, particularly in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In heavy ion
collisions, the early non-equilibrium state of quarks and gluons will become the final hadronic
states after a chemical freeze-out. Moreover, regions of large µBcan be experimentally researched
by lowering the beam energy. In recent years, relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments have
made significant progress in the search for the CEP [36, 37]. Various cumulants, including net-
proton, net-charge, and net-kaon cumulants, have been measured at different collision energies.
Notably, recent STAR data on net-proton distributions κσ2in Au+Au collisions as a function
of collision energy√SNNshows a non-monotonic variation, exhibiting a peak structure near√SNN≈7 GeV, which could be an experimental signature of the CEP [38–41]. Furthermore,
measurements have been extended to higher-order cumulants, including the sixth-order [42] and
eighth-order [43] cumulants of net-proton fluctuations. Non-monotonic dependencies on collision
energy have also been observed in the fifth-order and sixth-order cumulant data of net-proton
fluctuations in 0 −40% centrality Au-Au collisions [42].
Given the limited experimental data available that is confined to the crossover region with
µB/T≤3, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of conserved charge fluctuations at high
µB, where lattice simulations face challenges due to the sign problem. To address this non-
perturbative aspect, we employ holographic duality to map the strongly correlated physics of
the QCD phase diagram to a higher-dimensional gravity system. Holography offers a convenient
framework to incorporate real-time dynamics and study transport properties at finite temper-
atures and densities. Our holographic model has been demonstrated to capture the essential
characteristics of realistic QCD and successfully confront lattice QCD data with 2+1 flavors on
a quantitative level [44]. We have constructed the phase diagram in terms of TandµB, and
determined the location of the CEP at ( TC= 105 MeV , µC= 555 MeV) which falls within the
range accessible to upcoming experimental measurements [44]. In this study, we shall investigate
the behavior of baryon number fluctuations over a wide range of temperatures and baryon chem-
ical potentials. We will compare our holographic results with the experimental measurements
and will provide further theoretical predictions.1
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we briefly review our holographic
QCD model, including optimized parameters and equations of states. Section 3 shows the baryon
number susceptibilities up to the twelfth order at µB= 0. We also compare our holographic
results with the lattice QCD data. Section 4 compares our results to available experimental data
from heavy ion collisions along the chemical freeze-out line. We will present the prediction for
the beam energy dependence of baryon number susceptibilities for which no experimental data
is available yet. We conclude with some discussion in Section 5.
1Previous studies on the baryon susceptibilities using holographic QCD can be found in [33,45,46]. The model
was fixed by matching at zero baryon chemical potential to the lattice equation of state from [2]. It predicts a
CEP at a significantly different location in the phase diagram from our model [44].
32 Holographic QCD model
We consider the 2+1 flavor holographic QCD model established in [44]. The gravitational action
takes the following form.
SM=1

withgµνthe metric of the bulk spacetime, ϕthe scalar field, and Aµthe gauge field incorporating
finite baryon chemical potential and baryon density. Here V(ϕ) and Z(ϕ) are two free couplings in
our bottom-up model. The non-perturbative effects and flavor dynamics are effectively adopted
into the model parameters by matching up-to-date lattice QCD data.2
The bulk spacetime metric with matter fields ϕandAµreads
ds2=−e−η(r)f(r)dt2+dr2
f(r)+r2(dx2

ϕ=ϕ(r), A µdxµ=At(r)dt , (2.2)
where ris the holographic radial coordinate for which r→ ∞ corresponds to the AdS boundary.
Denoting the location of the event horizon as r=rhwhere f(rh) = 0, the Hawking temperature
and the entropy density are given by
T=1
4πf′(rh)e−η(rh)/2, s =2π

h. (2.3)
Substituting (2.2) into the action (2.1), one obtains the equations of motion that have to be
solved numerically to obtain the hairy black holes. Then, the related thermodynamic quantities,
including the energy density E, the pressure P, and the baryon chemical potential µBcan be
obtained using holographic renormalization (see [44] for more technical details).
The two couplings in (2.1) are parameterized to be [44]

where c1toc5are free parameters. The other two free parameters are the effective Newton
constant κ2
Nand a characteristic energy scale set by the leading source term of ϕ,i.e.ϕs=
limr→∞rϕ. The latter breaks the scale invariance of the boundary system to essentially describe
the QCD dynamics as there is no conformal symmetry in real QCD. All the above parameters are
fixed completely by fitting the lattice QCD data at zero net-baryon density [3,61,62] and their
values are summarized in Table 1. The parameter bis from the holographic renormalization and
is necessary to satisfy the lattice QCD simulation at µB= 0. We have made a slight modification
to the value of c4to enhance the agreement with lattice data compared to the previous setup [44].
2This approach involving a bulk nonconformal dilatonic scalar and a U(1) gauge field has been widely used
in holographic QCD, see e.g. [29,46–60].
4Nevertheless, this modification yields almost the same location of the CEP as the one of [44]. We
compare various thermodynamic quantities from our holographic setup with lattice simulation
in Fig. 1. One case sees that the temperature dependence of all those quantities agrees well with
lattice QCD with 2 + 1 flavors [3,61,62].

3 Baryon number susceptibility at µB= 0
As a benchmark test, we present the numerical results of the baryon number susceptibilities at
µB= 0 and compare them with available lattice QCD simulation.
The behavior of χB
2has been depicted in the right panel of Fig. 1. One can see clearly that
the holographic result is in good agreement with the latest lattice data from HotQCD group [62].
We compare higher-order susceptibilities in Fig. 2. The top two plots are for χB

2andχB

2,
respectively. The points with error bars are the lattice data with different Nτ, and the light-blue
6band represents the region of continuous extrapolation based on the lattice data [19,62,63]. The
holographic QCD results are given by solid red curves. Our direct computation matches well
with the lattice data, particularly the results of the continuous extrapolation. The temperature
dependence of χB
6andχB
8is presented in the bottom two plots of Fig. 2. Given that the
uncertainty of the HotQCD data is relatively high. It is still challenging to analyze the behavior
ofχB
8. Nevertheless, our χB
8results qualitatively agree with those from the W-B data [64] and
the FRG result [16].
While χB
2monotonically increases with the temperature at µB= 0, higher-order susceptibili-
ties versus temperature yield more complicated behaviors (see Fig. 2). The ratio χB
4/χB
2remains
positive throughout but it initially increases to a peak at T≈140 MeV, before decreasing to
approximately 0 .1 at high temperatures. Similarly, χB
6/χB
2exhibits an increase to about 2 .2
atT≈140 MeV, followed by a decrease to −0.4 atT≈165 MeV and a subsequent increase
to around 0. Thus, χB
6/χB
2displays a peak and a dip. The behavior of χB
6is similar to that
ofχB
6/χB
2due to the monotonically increasing dependence of χB
2on temperature. For χB
8, our
holographic result suggests that it initially grows from 0 to approximately 0 .2 by increasing T,
then decreases to around −0.5, and subsequently increases to 0 .2 again at high temperatures.

Both cases display a more intricate behavior with temperature, featuring both increasing and
decreasing trends, as well as positive and negative values. It will be of great interest to compare
our results with future lattice QCD data for χB

12, which would allow for a quantitative
assessment of the accuracy of our model.
74 Baryon number susceptibility along chemical freeze-
out line
In this section, we begin by examining the ratios of various higher-order baryon number sus-
ceptibilities at the collision energies measured by RHIC, following the chemical freeze-out data
determined by Gupta et al. [65]. We will consider two fitted chemical freeze-out lines, aiming
to capture the key characteristics of the CEP in the T−µBplane. As we will show, our theo-
retical predictions demonstrate some quantitative agreement with the most recent experimental
data [38,39,42,43,66] as well as the results obtained from the FRG approach [16].

The phase diagram of our holographic QCD model is presented in the left panel of Fig. 4,
wherein the blue dashed line corresponds to the crossover line determined by χB

our present work (see more details around Fig. 5 below). The green data, accompanied by errors,
corresponds to the chemical freeze-out data given in the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model [65].
In the right panel of Fig. 4, we present a comparison of the ratio of the fourth-order to second-
order baryon number susceptibilities, χB

2, obtained using our holographic QCD model for
collision energies of√SNN= 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62 .4, and 200 GeV, with experimental data
of net-proton distributions for 0 −5% centrality Au-Au collisions from STAR [39]. The grey
and brown error bars represent the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the experimental
data points, respectively. The fitted positions on the T−µBphase diagram for various collision
energies have been obtained from [65]. It is worth noting that the uncertainty in our theoretical
8results is attributed to the imprecision in determining the location of the fixed collision energy
on the T−µBphase diagram [65]. The direct comparison of Fig. 4, without any adjustable
parameters, demonstrates a significant overlap between our theoretical results and experimental
data at different collision energies.
Different centrality in heavy-ion collisions corresponds to different positions of chemical
freeze-out in the T−µBphase diagram [32]. Therefore, one should choose an appropriate
freeze-out line for a given centrality [67]. In the present study, we consider two chemical freeze-
out lines by fitting the dN/dy and 4 πyields data in [68,69]. Also note that our fitting procedure
does not yield a unique “optimal” fit for the data in [68,69], as we aim to optimize both the range
of experimentally fitted freeze-out data and the degree of agreement between theoretical values

peak becoming sharper and larger as we progress to higher orders.
We also find that at collision energies below√SNN≈5 GeV, the ratios χB

nobtained from
our model approach zero, which deviates from the STAR data of centrality 0 −40% [42] (see the
right column of Fig. 6). Such discrepancy observed at low collision energies could stem from sev-
eral factors, including non-equilibrium effects of low energy collisions and complex experimental
environments (such as rotation and magnetic field3in non-centric collisions). Therefore, further
studies are necessary to investigate the role of these effects on the above-observed discrepancy.

centrality of 0 −40% [43] and the FRG results [16] are also included as a comparison. Current
STAR data only includes points with collision energies of 27, 54 .4, and 200 GeV, and the
uncertainty is relatively high, making it challenging to identify non-monotonic behavior from
the data. Nevertheless, our results suggest that higher-order baryon number susceptibilities will
exhibit more pronounced non-monotonic behavior, with additional peaks and dips appearing

with improved precision.
5 Conclusion
In this study, we have investigated the behavior of higher-order baryon number susceptibilities
(χB
n) at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential using a quantitative holographic QCD
model that has been calibrated with lattice QCD data. We have observed a quantitative agree-
ment between our results and the HotQCD lattice data at µB= 0, see Figs. 1 and 2. The
examination of χB
10andχB
12will be possible in the future once relevant lattice data becomes
available.
To investigate the critical physics associated with the CEP, we have analyzed the depen-
dence of various ratios of χB
non collision energy along the chemical freeze-out line. Our findings
demonstrate a quantitative agreement with experimental data from STAR net-proton high mo-
ments in 0 −5% centrality and 0 −40% centrality Au-Au collisions, as well as FRG results for
second and third-order baryon number susceptibilities within the range√SNN≈12−200 GeV.
At lower collision energies, we have observed a clear peak structure from χB

around√SNN≈5−10 GeV (see Fig. 6), while experimental data is accumulating to check
this feature. Regarding the fourth to sixth-order ratios, our results have exhibited quantita-
tive agreement with experimental data and FRG results over a broad collision energy range
of√SNN≈7.7−200 GeV. We have found that all ratios χB
m/χB
nwith m > n display peak
structures around√SNN≈5−10 GeV, characterized by sharper and higher peaks as mis
increased.
However, for low collision energies (√SNN<5 GeV), the ratios χB
m/χB
ntend to approach
zero, which deviates from the STAR data. This discrepancy can potentially be attributed to
non-equilibrium effects present in low-energy collisions, as well as the influence of complex ex-
perimental environments, such as rotation and magnetic field effects in non-central collisions.
Notably, it has been proposed that rotation might have a significant impact on the results
obtained from low-energy collisions. Therefore, we suggest that future experiments with mea-
surements conducted in the low collision energy range of√SNN≈1−10 GeV, along with
reduced experimental uncertainties, will unveil further non-monotonic behavioral signals that
could aid in the precise determination of the location of the CEP.
