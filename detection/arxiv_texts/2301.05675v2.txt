DOUBLE SOUL CONJECTURE
JASON DEVITO
Abstract. A double disk bundle is any smooth closed manifold obtained as the
union of the total spaces of two disk bundles, glued together along their common
boundary. The Double Soul Conjecture asserts that a closed simp ly connected man-
ifold admitting a metric of non-negative sectional curvature is nece ssarily a double
disk bundle. We study a generalization of this conjecture by droppin g the require-
ment that the manifold be simply connected. Previously, a unique cou nterexample
was known to this generalization, the Poincar´ e dodecahedral spa ceS3/I∗. We ﬁnd
inﬁnitely many 3-dimensional counterexamples, as well as another in ﬁnite family of
ﬂat counterexamples whose dimensions grow without bound.

We refer the reader to the introduction of [DGGK] for numerous e xamples of this.
Our main interest stems from Grove’s Double Soul Conjecture [Gro0 2].
Conjecture 1.1 (Double Soul Conjecture) .SupposeMis a closed simply connected
manifold which admits a Riemannian metric of non-negative s ectional curvature.
ThenMis a double disk bundle.
Evidence for this conjecture includes the fact that cohomogeneit y one manifolds
(andfreeisometricquotientsbyasub-actionofthecohomogeneit yoneaction[Wil07]),
which are one of two main building blocks for non-negatively curved ma nifolds, ad-
mit such a structure [Mos57, GGZ18]. In addition, Cheeger [Che73] s howed that the
connect sum of two compact rank one symmetric spaces (CROSS) a dmits a metric of
non-negative sectional curvature. As a CROSS with a small open ba ll removed has
the structure of a disk bundle, these manifolds also verify the doub le soul conjec-
ture. In addition, Cheeger and Gromoll’s Soul Theorem [CG72] gives a n analogous
theorem for non-compact complete Riemannian manifolds of non-ne gative sectional

curvature. The conjecture has also been veriﬁed for many other examples, includ-
ing all known simply connected positively curved manifolds [DGGK, The orem 3.3],
simply connected biquotients in dimension at most 7 [GAG], and simply con nected
homogeneous spaces of dimension at most 10 [GAG]. We recall that a b iquotient
is the quotient of a Riemannian homogeneous space by a free isometr ic action, and
comprise the other main building block of non-negatively curved manif olds.
The conjecture also implies some classiﬁcation results. For example, if true, then
it would follow that our known list of non-negatively curved simply conn ected 4 and
5-dimensional manifolds is complete [GR15, Theorem 1.1],[DGGK, Theore m B].
Grove [Gro02] notes the the natural generalization of Conjectur e 1.1 to non-simply
connected manifolds is false: the Poincar´ e dodecahedral space S3/I∗admits a posi-
tively curved Riemannian metric, but does not support a double disk b undle struc-
ture. However, this was previously the only known counterexample to the generalized
conjecture. As such, it is natural to search for more, with variou s topological and
geometric properties. Our main result supplies inﬁnitely many counte rexamples to
the generalized conjecture, on opposite ends of the non-negativ e curvature landscape.
Theorem 1.2. There are inﬁnitely many closed Riemannian 3-manifolds of positive
sectional curvature which are not double disk bundles. In ad dition, there are inﬁnitely
many closed ﬂat manifolds which are not double disk bundles.
The 3-manifold family consists of inﬁnitely many non-trivial isometric q uotients
of a round S3. The homogeneous spaces S3/I∗(which was ﬁrst found by Grove),
S3/O∗,S3/T∗, whereI∗,O∗, andT∗are the binary isocosahedral, octahedral, and
tetrahedral groups are among these examples.
In fact,S3/I∗,S3/O∗, andS3/T∗are the only homogeneous spaces among our
examples. It is thus natural to wonder if there are more. This leads to the obvious
question:
Question 1.3. Are there inﬁnitely many homogeneous spaces which are not do uble
disk bundles?
Given that the three homogeneous examples of Theorem 1.2 are quo tients ofS3,
oneistemptedtoanswer Question1.3bylookingathomogeneousquo tientsofspheres
of higher dimension. However, we prove that S3/I∗,S3/O∗, andS3/T∗are the only
homogeneous quotients of a sphere, in any dimension, which are not double disk
bundles; see Proposition 4.9.
The other inﬁnite family, the closed ﬂat manifolds, are precisely thos e with trivial
ﬁrst homology group. The construction of such ﬂat manifolds is rat her abstract, so we
have been unable to determine which dimensions these examples appe ar. However,
we can show they exist in arbitrarily large dimensions.
We stress that all of our examples have non-trivial fundamental g roups, so the
Double Soul Conjecture remains open. In fact, all of our examples have non-nilpotent
fundamental groups, the the generalized Double Soul Conjectur e is still open for
nilpotent manifolds.COUNTEREXAMPLES TO THE NON-SIMPLY CONNECTED DSC 3
We now give an outline of the proof of Theorem 1.2, beginning with the t hree-
dimensional examples. We ﬁrst prove that if M3has a metric of positive sectional
curvature and is a double disk bundle, then it must have a double disk b undle struc-
ture where the common boundary ∂DB−∼=∂DB+is diﬀeomorphic to a sphere S2or
to a torusT2. We then classify all disk bundles whose total space has boundary d iﬀeo-
morphic to S2orT2, and then consider all possible ways of gluing these together. The
double disk bundle decomposition lends itself to the use of the Seifert -van Kampen
Theorem, so we are able to compute presentations for all the resu lting fundamental
groups. The end conclusion is that a positively curved M3admits a double disk bun-
dle decomposition if and only if it is a lens space or a particular Z/2Zquotient of a
lens space, a so-called prism manifold. From the known classiﬁcation o f fundamental
groups of spherical 3-manifolds [Wol11, Section 7.5], we obtain inﬁnite ly many exam-
ples which are not double disk bundles. It is worth noting that the exa mples we ﬁnd
are the only 3-dimensional counterexamples to the double soul con jecture, even under
the weaker assumption that Mhas a Riemannian metric of non-negative sectional
curvature; see Remark 4.3.
For the ﬂat examples, enumerating all the possibilities for the commo n boundary
∂DB−∼=∂DB+is not feasible, so we proceed diﬀerently. We ﬁrst show in Proposition
3.6 that for any manifold covered by a contractible manifold, any dou ble disk bundle
decomposition must have both disk bundles of rank 1. On the other h and, we also
establish (Proposition 3.2) that if a manifold admits a double disk bundle structure
with at least one double disk bundle has rank 1, then the manifold must have a
non-trivial double cover, which in turn implies that the ﬁrst homology group surjects
ontoZ/2Z. Thus, any ﬂat manifold with trivial ﬁrst homology group cannot be a
double disk bundle. Such ﬂat manifolds have been constructed by Ig or Belegradek
[Bel], providing the examples.
An outline of the paper follows. In Section 2, we cover the required b ackground
and set up notation. Section 3 contains general results on the top ology of double disk
bundles especially in the case where at least one disk bundle has rank 1 . In Section
4, we classify the non-negatively curved 3-manifolds which are doub le disk bundles,
ﬁnding that some positively curved examples are not double disk bund les. Finally,
Section 5 contains the results concerning ﬂat manifolds.

2.Background and Notation
SupposeB−andB+are closed manifolds and that Dℓ±+1→DB±→B±are disk
bundles. We assume their boundaries are diﬀeomorphic, say by a diﬀe omorphism
f:∂DB−→∂DB+. Then we can form the closed manifold M=DB−∪fDB+by
gluingDB−andDB+alongtheirboundary.Amanifoldobtainedviathisconstruction
is called a double disk bundle .4 JASON DEVITO
Restricting the projection maps to their respective boundaries, w e obtain sphere
bundlesSℓ±→∂DB±→B±. The numbers ℓ±≥0 will always refer to the dimension
ofthese ﬁber spheres. Wewill use Ltodenotethediﬀeomorphism typeofthecommon
boundary. We will borrow language from the ﬁeld of Singular Riemannia n Foliations,
and refer to Las the regular leaf and the B±as the singular leaves.
As was shown in [DGGK, Proposition 4.1], if a connected closed manifold Mad-
mits a double disk bundle decomposition, then it necessarily admits one where both
B±are connected. Thus we can and will always assume that in any double disk bun-
dle decomposition, both singular leaves B±are connected. Using the sphere bundles
Sℓ±→L→B±, the condition that both B±are connected implies that Lhas at
most 2 components, and that Lis connected unless B−andB+are diﬀeomorphic,
ℓ−=ℓ+= 0, andL∼=S0×B−∼=S0×B+.
The decomposition of Minto two disk bundles is ideal for applying the Mayer-
Vietoris sequence in cohomology, as well as the Seifert-van Kampen theorem for
fundamental groups, at least when Lis connected. In this context, we note that
contracting the ﬁber disks in either DB±provides a deformation retract of DB±to
B±, and the inclusion map L∼=∂DB±⊆DB±becomes homotopic to the sphere
bundle projection L→B±under this deformation retract.
3.Some general structure results for double disk bundles
In this section, we will collect several needed facts regarding the r elationship be-
tween the ﬁber sphere dimensions ℓ±and coverings. We begin with some general
structure results where at least one ℓ±= 0.
Lemma 3.1. SupposeS0→L→Bis a sphere bundle with ℓ= 0andBa connected
smooth manifold. There is a smooth free involution σ:L→LwithL/σdiﬀeomorphic
toB.
Proof.BecauseS0consists of two points, the sphere bundle is nothing but a double
cover. IfLis disconnected, it follows that L∼=S0×Band the required involution σ
simply interchanges the two copies of B.
On the other hand, if Lis connected, the covering L→Bis characterized by an
index 2-subgroupof π1(B), which isnecessarily normal. Hence, thecovering isregular,
so the deck group is isomorphic to Z/2Z. Then one can take σto be the non-trivial
element of the deck group.
/square
Proposition 3.2. SupposeMis a connected manifold and M=DB−∪fDB+is a
double disk bundle with ℓ−= 0. ThenMadmits a non-trivial double cover of the form
M=DB+∪gDB+for some diﬀeomorphism g:L→L. That is,Mhas a double
disk bundle decomposition where each half is a copy of DB+.
Proof.Becauseℓ−= 0, Lemma 3.1 gives a free involution σ:L→Lwith quotient
B−. We now form Mas the the union
M= (DB+×{−1})∪σ◦fL×[−1,1]∪f(DB+×{1}),COUNTEREXAMPLES TO THE NON-SIMPLY CONNECTED DSC 5
whereDB+× {−1}is glued to L× {−1}andDB+× {1}is glued to L× {1}.
From [Kos93, Chapter VI, Section 5], the union ( DB+× {−1})∪σ◦fL×[−1,1] is
diﬀeomorphicto DB+,soMisdiﬀeomorphictoadoublediskbundlewithbothhalves
a copy ofDB+.
Thus, we need only show that Mis a double cover of M. To that end, we deﬁne
a free involution ρonMwhose quotient is M. Given (x,±1)∈DB+× {±1}, we
deﬁneρ(x,±1) = (x,∓1). In other words, ρinterchanges the two copies of DB+on
the“ends” of M. In addition, we deﬁne the action of ρonL×[−1,1] by mapping a
point (y,t) to (σ(y),−t). It is easy to verify that this is the required involution.
/square
If bothℓ±= 0, then applying Proposition 3.2 gives a double cover which again has
bothℓ±= 0. Hence, we can iterate this procedure. This shows that a manifo ld can
only admit a double disk bundle decomposition with both ℓ±= 0 ifπ1(M) is inﬁnite.
In fact, while it will not be needed in the remainder of the paper, it tur ns out that a
double cover of Mﬁbers overS1.
Proposition 3.3. SupposeMis a connected manifold which admits a double disk
bundle structure with both ℓ−=ℓ+= 0and regular leaf L. Thenπ1(M)is inﬁnite,
andMhas a double cover Mwhich ﬁbers over S1with ﬁberL.
Proof.We have already proven the ﬁrst statement, so we focus on the se cond. By
assumption, we may write M=DB+∪fDB−for some diﬀeomorphism f:L→L.
As bothℓ±= 0, Lemma 3.1 gives a pair of free involutions σ±:L→Lwith
L/σ±diﬀeomorphic to B±. Bothσ±extend to involutions on L×[−1,1] deﬁned by
(y,t)/mapsto→(σ±(y),−t). The quotient ( L×[−1,1])/σ±is clearly diﬀeomorphic to DB±.
Now, take two copies of L×[−1,1], which we will refer to as the left copy and right
copy. We glue ( y,1) in the left copy to ( f(y),1) in the right copy, and we glue ( y,−1)
in the left copy to ( σ+(f(σ−(y))),−1) to form the manifold M.
From [Kos93, Chapter VI, Section 5], if we only do the gluing of ( y,1) to (f(y),1),
the resulting manifold is diﬀeomorphic to L×[−1,1]. Thus,Mhas the structure of a
mapping torus for some self diﬀeomorphism of L, so is a bundle over S1with ﬁberL.
It remains to see that Mis a double cover of M. To that end, we deﬁne a free
involutionρonMwith quotient Mas follows. On the left copy of L×[−1,1],ρacts
by (y,t)/mapsto→(σ−(y),−t). On the right copy, ρacts by (y,t)/mapsto→(σ+(y),−t). Once again,
it is easy to verify this has the desired properties.
/square
Remark3.4.In Proposition 3.3, if Lis disconnected, then Mitself ﬁbers over S1. On
the other hand, if Lis connected, passing to a double cover is sometimes necessary
to obtain the bundle structure. For example, if M=RPn#RPnwithn≥3, then
Mhas a double disk bundle structure with both ℓ±= 0. Indeed, RPnwith a ball
removed is a diﬀeomorphic to the total space of the disk bundle in the tautological
bundle over RPn−1. ButMdoes not ﬁber over S1because its fundamental group
π1(M)∼=(Z/2Z)∗(Z/2Z) has abelianization ( Z/2Z)⊕(Z/2Z), so does not surject

Proposition 3.5. SupposeMis a connected manifold which admits a double disk
bundle structure with both ℓ±≥1. Ifρ:M′→Mis any non-trivial covering (in
the sense that M′is connected), then M′is a double disk bundle with regular leaf
L′:=ρ−1(L), singular leaves B′
±:=ρ−1(B±), and withℓ′
±=ℓ±. In addition, each of
L′,B′
+, andB′
−are connected.
Proof.Since a covering map is a submersion, everything except the connec tedness of
L′,B′
±is a direct consequence of [DGGK, Proposition 3.1d]. Thus, we need on ly show
the connectedness of L′andB′
±. As bothB′
±are the continuous image of the sphere
bundle projections L′→B′
±, it is suﬃcient to show that L′is connected.
So, we now show that L′is connected. Because ρis a covering, so is ρ|L′:L′→L.
In addition, since at least one ℓ±≥1,Lmust be connected. Thus, to show L′is
connected, it is suﬃcient to select x∈L, and show that any pair of points in ρ−1(x)
can be connected by a path in L′. Letx1,x2∈ρ−1(x).
BecauseM′is connected, we may connect x1andx2by a pathγ′: [0,1]→M′in
M′. Thenγ:=ρ◦γ′is a closed curve in M.
We claim that γis homotopic rel endpoints to a closed curve αlying entirely in L.
To see this, note that γrepresents an element of π1(M,x), so we need to show the
mapπ1(L,x)→π1(M,x) induced by the inclusion L→Mis surjective.
Seifert-van Kampen applied to the double disk bundle decomposition o fMshows
that any curve in Mis, up to homotopy rel endpoints, a ﬁnite concatenation of curves
inDB+andDB−. Because both ℓ±≥1, the long exact sequence in homotopy groups
implies the maps π1(L)→π1(DB±)∼=π1(B±) are surjective, so each curve in DB+
orDB−is homotopic rel end points to one lying entirely in L. In particular, γis
homotopic rel end points to a curve αinL.
Now, since ρ:L′→Lis a covering, it is, in particular, a ﬁbration. As γhas a lift
toM′,αmust lift to a curve α′: [0,1]→M′. Since the homotopy from γtoαﬁxed
the end points and the ﬁber of ρis discrete, α′must have the same endpoints as γ′.
That is,α′is a curve connecting x1andx2with image in L′. This completes the proof
thatL′is is connected, and thus, of the proposition.

In the special that Mis aspherical, i.e., the universal cover of Mis contractible,
we can completely characterize the possibilities for the ﬁber sphere dimensions ℓ±for
any double disk bundle structure on it.
Proposition 3.6. SupposeMis an aspherical manifold which admits a double disk
bundle structure. Then both ℓ−=ℓ+= 0. That is, both ﬁber spheres are zero-
dimensional.
Proof.We assume for a contradiction that Mhas a double disk bundle decomposition
with say,ℓ−>0. This implies that the regular leaf Lis connected. If ℓ+= 0, then
Proposition 3.2 implies that Mhas a double cover admitting a double disk bundleCOUNTEREXAMPLES TO THE NON-SIMPLY CONNECTED DSC 7
structure with both ℓ±>0. Noting that the double cover of an aspherical manifold
is aspherical, we may therefore assume that both ℓ±>0.
In this case, we consider the universal cover ρ:M′→M. From Proposition 3.5, we
obtain a double disk bundle structure on M′with regular leaf L′and singular leaves
B′
±connected. Wewill conclude theproofbyshowing that M′has nosuch double disk
bundle structure. Speciﬁcally, we will show that Ht(ℓ++ℓ−)(L′;Z/2Z) is non-trivial for
allt≥0,contradicting thefact that L′isa ﬁnite dimensional manifold. Set R=Z/2Z
for legibility.
BecauseM′is contractible, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the double disk bu ndle
decomposition of M′yields isomorphisms ψk:Hk(B′
−;R)⊕Hk(B′
+;R)→Hk(L′;R)
for eachk≥1 (and that ψ0is surjective). Recalling that ψkis nothing but the
diﬀerence in the maps induced by the sphere bundle projections L→B±, it follows
that each map Hk(B′
±;R)→Hk(L′;R) must injective. Since both B′
±are connected,
wehaveGysinsequences associatedto L→B±;injectivityof H∗(B′
±;R)→H∗(L′;R)
then implies via the Gysin sequence that the R-Euler class of both bundles L′→B′
±
is trivial. We thus have group isomorphisms
H∗(L′;R)∼=H∗(B′
+;R)⊗H∗(Sℓ+;R)∼=H∗(B′
−;R)⊗H∗(Sℓ−;R),
where the inclusions H∗(B′
±;R)→H∗(B′
±;R)⊗H∗(Sℓ±;R) are the obvious ones.
We will now prove that Ht(ℓ−+ℓ+)(L′;R)/ne}ationslash= 0 for all t≥0 by induction. The base
case is clear, as it is simply the assertion that H0(L′;R)/ne}ationslash= 0.
Now, assume that Ht(ℓ−+ℓ+)(L′;R) is non-zero for some t≥0. Sinceψkfork:=
t(ℓ++ℓ−) is surjective, there must therefore be a non-zero element xin at least one
ofHk(B′
±;R). We assume without loss of generality that x∈Hk(B′
+;R). Ify±∈
Hℓ±(Sℓ±;R)∼=Ris the non-zero element, then the element x⊗y+∈Hk+ℓ+(L′;R)
is non-zero, and not in the image of Hk+ℓ+(B′
+;R). Sinceψk+ℓ+is surjective, it now
followsthat Hk+ℓ+(B′
−;R)/ne}ationslash= 0.Suppose z∈Hk+ℓ+(B′
−;R)issuchanon-zeroelement.
Then the element z⊗y−∈H(t+1)(ℓ−+ℓ+)(L′;R) is non-zero, completing the induction.
/square
We will also need a proposition regarding orientability.
Proposition 3.7. SupposeMis a double disk bundle and that Mis orientable. Then
so is the regular leaf L.
Proof.BecauseLis the boundary of both disk bundles, Lmust have trivial normal
bundle. Then TM|L=TL⊕1 with 1 denoting a trivial rank 1 bundle. Computing
the ﬁrst Stiefel-Whitney class using the Whitney sum formula, we ﬁnd
0 =w1(TM|L) =w1(TL)+w1(1) =w1(TL).
Thusw1(TL) = 0, soLis orientable.

4. 3-dimensional examples
The goal of this section is to prove the following theorem.8 JASON DEVITO
Theorem 4.1. SupposeM3is a closed manifold admitting a metric of positive sec-
tional curvature. Then Mis a double disk bundle if and only if MisS3, a lens space
L(p,q), or a prism manifold.

gcd(α,β) = 1. Prism manifolds include the homogeneous spaces S3/D∗
4nwhereD∗
4n
is the order 4 ngroup generated by e2πi/nandjin the group Sp(1) of unit length
quaternions.
From, e.g.,[McC00, Table 1], the homogeneous 3-manifolds which are co vered by
S3consists of precisely the lens space L(p,1), the prism manifolds S3/D∗
4n, and the
spacesS3/T∗,S3/O∗, orS3/I∗whereT∗,O∗, andI∗are the binary tetrahedral,
octohedral,andicosahedralgroupsrespectively. Inaddition,fr ome.g.,[Wol11,Section
7.5], the product of any of these fundamental groups with a cyclic g roup of relatively
prime order is again the fundamental group of a positively curved 3- manifold. Thus,
Theorem 4.1has the following corollary.
Corollary 4.2. There are inﬁnitely many positively curved 3-manifolds which do
not admit a double disk bundle structure. These examples inc lude precisely three ho-
mogeneous examples: S3/T∗,S3/O∗, andS3/I∗, wereT∗,O∗,andI∗are the binary
tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral groups respecti vely.
Remark 4.3.By using work of others, it is easy to extend Theorem 4.1 to non-
negatively curved three manifolds. Hamilton [Ham82, Main Theorem][H am86, Theo-
rem 1.2] showed a closed 3-manifold Madmitting a metric of non-negative sectional
curvature is covered by S3,S2×S1, orT3. IfMis covered by S2×S1, thenMis
diﬀeomorphic to S2×S1,RP2×S1,RP3#RP3, or to theunique non-trivial S2bundle
overS1[Tol74]. Clearly for each of these possibilities, Mis a double disk bundle. If
Mis covered by T3, then from [Sco83, pg. 448], Mis a double disk bundle.
We now work towards proving Theorem 4.1. For the remainder of this section,M
denotes a 3-manifold of positive sectional curvature. From [Ham82 , Main Theorem],
Mis ﬁnitely covered by S3, so has ﬁnite fundamental group. A simple application of
theLefshetz ﬁxedpointtheoremimplies that Mmust beorientable. FromProposition
3.3, at least one of ℓ±>0, which, in particular, implies that Lis connected.
Proposition 4.4. SupposeMis a closed orientable 3-manifold which admits a double
disk bundle decomposition with at least one ﬁber sphere of po sitive dimension. The
regular leaf Lmust be diﬀeomorphic to either S2orT2.
Proof.Assume without loss of generality that ℓ+>0. This implies that Lis con-
nected.Since Lis2-dimensionalandan Sℓ+-bundleover B+,wemusthave ℓ+∈ {1,2}.
Ifℓ+= 2, the ﬁber inclusion map S2→Lis an embedding between closed manifolds

We will proceed by breaking into cases depending on whether L=S2orL=T2.
We will classify all disk bundles whose boundary is diﬀeomorphic to L, and then
classify ways of gluing the corresponding disk bundles. Using a collar n eighborhood,
it easy to see that if two gluing maps are isotopic, then the correspo nding double
disk bundles are diﬀeomorphic. The following lemma provides another c ircumstance
where the double disk bundles are diﬀeomorphic.
Lemma 4.5. SupposeXandYare manifolds with boundary and f:∂X→∂Yis
a diﬀeomorphism. Assume in addition that G:X→Xis a diﬀeomorphism with
g:=G|∂X:∂X→∂X. Then the manifolds X∪fYandX∪f◦gYare diﬀeomorphic.
Proof.We deﬁne a diﬀeomorphism φ:X∪f◦gY→X∪fYby mapping x∈Xto
φ(x) =G(x) andmapping y∈Ytoφ(y) =y.It is obvious that φis adiﬀeomorphism,
if it is well deﬁned.
We now check that it is well-deﬁned. If we ﬁrst identify x∈∂Xwithf(g(x)) and
then apply φ, we obtain the point f(g(x)). On the other hand, if we ﬁrst apply φand
then identify with ∂Y, we getφ(x) =G(x) =g(x)∼f(g(x)).

Proposition 4.6. SupposeMis a double disk bundle with regular leaf L=S2. Then,
Mis diﬀeomorphic to S3,RP3, orRP3#RP3.
Proof.To begin with, note there are precisely two isomorphism types of sph ere bun-
dles with total space S2: they areS2→S2→ {p}, andS0→S2→RP2. Since a
diﬀeomorphism of either S0orS1extends to a diﬀeomorphism of the corresponding
disk, both of these extend uniquely to disk bundles. Moreover, Diﬀ( S2) deformation
retracts to O(2) [Sma59], so we may assume our gluing map is either the identity or
the antipodal map. Both options extend to a diﬀeomorphism of the 3 -ballB3, so by
Lemma 4.5 the choice of gluing map is irrelevant if either B±={p}.
If we have B+=B−={p}, thenMis obtained by gluing two 3-balls along
their boundary S2, soMis diﬀeomorphic to S3in this case. If we have B+={p}
andB−=RP2, then gluing gives RP3. Finally, if we have B+=B−=RP2, we
obtainRP3#±RP3. ButRP3admits an orientation reversing diﬀeomorphism, so
RP3#−RP3is diﬀeomorphic to RP3♯RP3.
/square
We now classify all double disk bundles with regular leaf L=T2and with at least
oneℓ±>0, which completes the proof of Theorem 4.1.
Proposition 4.7. SupposeMadmits a double disk bundle structure with regular leaf
L=T2and withℓ+>0. Then either π1(M)is abelian, or Mis a prism manifold.
Remark 4.8.The classiﬁcation of 3-manifolds with π1(M) abelian is well known
[AFW15, Section 1.7, Table 2]. The only such examples which are covere d byS3
are the lens spaces L(p,q). Each of these is well-known to be a double disk bundle,
e.g., they are all quotients of S3via a sub-action of the well-known cohomogeneity10 JASON DEVITO
one action of T2onS3. The examples which are not covered by S3are covered by
S2×S1, so are all double disk bundles by Remark 4.3.
Proof.The assumption that ℓ+>0 implies that ℓ+= 1, soB+=S1. AnS1-bundle
overS1is determined by an element of π0(Diﬀ(S1)). Since Diﬀ( S1) deformation re-
tracts toO(2), there are precisely two S1-bundles over S1. Of course, one has total
spaceK, the Klein bottle. Thus, there is a unique S1bundle over S1with total space
T2, the trivial bundle.
Ifℓ−= 2, the ﬁber inclusion S2→T2must be an embedding, giving an obvious
contradiction. Hence, ℓ−∈ {0,1}. Of course, if ℓ−= 1, then the bundle L→B−must
be the trivial bundle as in the previous paragraph. On the other han d, ifℓ−= 0, then
L→B−is a 2-fold covering, so B−is diﬀeomorphic to either T2orK.
Each of these S1-bundles extends to a disk bundle in a unique way. In addition,
Diﬀ(T2) deformation retracts to GL2(Z) [FM11, Theorem 2.5], so we can always
assume our gluing map lies in Gl2(Z). Moreover, the diﬀeomorphism/bracketleftbigg
1 0
0−1/bracketrightbigg
of
T2=∂(D2×S1) extends to a diﬀeomorphism of DB+∼=D2×S1, so Lemma 4.5
implies that we may assume our gluing map lies in Gl+
2(Z).
Applying Siefert-van Kampen to the double disk decomposition of M, we note
that sinceℓ+= 1, the map π1(L)→π1(B+) is surjective. This implies that π1(M)
is isomorphic to a quotient of π1(DB−) =π1(B−). Thus, ifB−/ne}ationslash=K, thenπ1(M) is
necessarily abelian.
So, we assume B−=K, and that the gluing map is determined by a matrix

We have presentations
π1(S1) =/an}bracketle{ta/an}bracketri}ht,π1(T2)∼=/an}bracketle{tb,c|[b,c] = 1/an}bracketri}ht,andπ1(K) =/an}bracketle{td,e|ded−1e= 1/an}bracketri}ht.
The unique abelian index 2 subgroup of π1(K) is generated by {d2,e}. We may
therefore assume the map π1(T2)→π1(K) mapsbtod2andctoe, and that the map
π1(T2)→π1(S1) mapsbtoaandcto the identity element.
Note that under the gluing map/bracketleftbigg

multiplicative notation rather than additive for both π1(T2)∼=Z2andπ1(S1)∼=Z.
Thus, Seifert-van Kampen gives
π1(M)∼=/an}bracketle{ta,d,e|ded−1e= 1,aα=d2,aβ=e/an}bracketri}ht.
We claim that this is isomorphic to

so thatMhas the fundamental group of a prism manifold.COUNTEREXAMPLES TO THE NON-SIMPLY CONNECTED DSC 11
To that end, we ﬁrst note that the generator ain the ﬁrst presentation is unneces-
sary. Indeed, we have αδ−βγ= 1, so
a1=aαδ−βγ= (aα)δ(aβ)−γ=d2δe−γ.
Thus, we need only demonstrate that the relations in the ﬁrst pres entation are con-
sequences of the relations in the second, and vice versa.
So, assume initially that both aα=d2andaβ=e. Raising the ﬁrst relation to the
power ofβ, and the second to the power of α, we obtain
d2β=aαβ=eα,
so the relations in the ﬁrst presentation imply those in the second. C onversely, as-
sumingd2β=eα, noting that d2commutes with everything, and setting a=d2δe−γ,
we ﬁnd
aα=d2αδe−γα
=d2(1+βγ)e−γα
=d2(d2β)γ(eα)−γ
=d2(eα)γ(eα)−γ
=d2
and likewise, we ﬁnd that aβ=e.
Thus,π1(M) isisomorphictothefundamentalgroupofaprismmanifold,asdeﬁn ed
above. Since such manifolds are classiﬁed up to diﬀeomorphism by the ir fundamental
group [AFW15, Theorem 2.2], Mmust be a prism manifold in these cases.

We conclude this section by proving that the three homogeneous ex amplesS3/T∗,
S3/O∗, andS3/I∗of Corollary 4.2 are the only homogeneous examples in any dimen-
sion which are covered by a sphere but are not double disk bundles.
Proposition 4.9. SupposeMis a closed homogeneous space which is covered by
a sphere. Then Madmits a double disk bundle decomposition, except when Mis
diﬀeomorphic to one of S3/T∗,S3/O∗,orS3/I∗.
Proof.From [WZ15, Table 2], we see that the homogeneous spaces non-triv ially
covered by a sphere are a) real projective space, b) a homogene ous lens space,
or c) a quotient of S4n−1⊆Hnby a non-abelian ﬁnite subgroup of Sp(1) act-
ing diagonally. Here, a homogeneous lens space is a quotient S2n+1/(Z/mZ) where
Z/mZ={(z,z,...,z)∈Cn+1:zm= 1}, andHdenotes the skew-ﬁeld of quaternions.
We have a uniform description of these actions: let K∈ {R,C,H}and setk=
dimR(K). LetGdenote any ﬁnite subgroup of O(1),U(1) orSp(1) respectively. Then
Gacts freely on Skn−1⊆Knvia the diagonal action in each coordinate and the cases
a),b), and c) above correspond to the choice of K.
We ﬁrst claim that if n≥2 then all such quotients Snk−1/Gadmit a double
disk bundle decomposition. Indeed, one can simply observe that the block action by12 JASON DEVITO
O(n−1)×O(1),U(n−1)×U(1), orSp(n−1)×Sp(1) onSnk−1⊆Kn=Kn−1⊕K
is cohomogeneity one, and Gacts via a subaction of the block action.
This leaves the case n= 1, which gives the manifolds S0/G,S1/G, orS3/G. Of
course, the ﬁrst is 0-dimensional, and any quotient S1/Gis diﬀeomorphic to S1, and
thus admits a double disk bundle decomposition. The ﬁnal case S3/Gis given by
Corollary 4.2. /square
5.Flat examples
The goal of this section is to prove the following theorem.
Theorem 5.1. There are inﬁnitely many closed ﬂat manifolds, in arbitrari ly large
dimension, which are not double disk bundles.
We begin with a proposition which allows us to recognize when a ﬂat manif old does
not admit a double disk bundle decompositoin.
Proposition 5.2. SupposeMis a closed ﬂat manifold with H1(M)ﬁnite of odd
order. Then Mcannot admit a double disk bundle decomposition.
Proof.Assume for a contradiction that Madmits a double disk bundle decomposi-
tion. Since Mis ﬂat, the Cartan-Hadamard theorem implies that Mis aspherical.
Thus, Proposition 3.6 applies: any double disk bundle decomposition on Mmust have
bothℓ±= 0. Then, fromProposition3.2, Madmits a non-trivial double cover. In par-
ticular,π1(M) must have an index 2 subgroup, so admits a surjection to Z/2Z. Since
H1(M) is the abelianization of π1(M), this surjection must factor through H1(M).
But no ﬁnite group of odd order admits a surjection to Z/2Z, giving a contradiction.
/square
In order to prove Theorem 5.1, we need only establish the existence of inﬁnitely
many ﬂat manifolds Min arbitrarily large dimensions with ﬁrst homology group
H1(M) ﬁnite of odd order. In fact, we will ﬁnd examples with H1(M) trivial. As
H1(M) is the abelianization of π1(M), we are thus tasked with ﬁnding an inﬁnite
family of ﬂat manifolds for which π1(M) = [π1(M),π1(M)] is perfect. These examples
are furnished by the following theorem.
Theorem 5.3. Supposeφis any ﬁnite perfect group. Then there is a closed ﬂat
manifoldMφfor whichH1(Mφ) = 0and for which Mφhas holonomy φ.
Recall that the alternating group on nletters,Anis perfect if n≥4. We claim
that forn≥7, that dim MAn≥n−1, so Theorem 5.1 immediately follows from
Proposition 5.2 and Theorem 5.3. Indeed, the holonomy group of an n-manifold is
a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(n), and forn≥7, the smallest non-trivial
representation of Anoccurs in dimension n−1 [FH04, Problem 5.5].
Thus, to prove Theorem 5.1, we need only to prove Theorem 5.3. We d o this using
an argument due to Igor Belegradek [Bel].
We will use the following characterization of the fundamental group of a closed ﬂat
manifold.COUNTEREXAMPLES TO THE NON-SIMPLY CONNECTED DSC 13
Theorem 5.4 (Bieberbach[Bie11] and Auslander-Kuranishi [AK57]) .An abstract
groupπis the fundamental group of a closed ﬂat n-manifold if and only if both of the
following conditions are satisﬁed.
(1)πis torsion free
(2)πﬁts into a short exact sequence of the form 0→Zn→π→φ→0, whereφ
is a ﬁnite group.
The ﬁnite group φis called the holonomy of πas it is isomorphic to the holonomy
group of the ﬂat manifold n-manifold with fundamental group π.
We need a lemma, which is [HP89, Proposition 2.3.13].
Lemma 5.5. Suppose a group πﬁts into a short exact sequence of the form
0→Zn→π→φ→0
whereφis a ﬁnite group. Then the commutator subgroup π′= [π,π]also ﬁts into a
short exact sequence of the form
0→Zm→π′→φ′= [φ,φ]→0.
In addition, if φis perfect, then so is π′.
We may now prove Theorem 5.3.
Proof.(Proof of Theorem 5.3) Let φdenote any ﬁnite perfect group. From [AK57,
Theorem 3] there is an abstract group πsatisfying both conditions of Theorem 5.4.
Thecommutator π′= [π,π]isasubgroupofthetorsionfreegroup π,so istorsionfree.
From Lemma 5.5, π′is also perfect, and satisﬁes the second condition of Theorem 5.4
with ﬁnite quotient φ′= [φ,φ] =φ. Hence, by Theorem 5.4, there is a ﬂat manifold
Mφwith fundamental group π′. Sinceπ′is perfect,H1(Mφ) = 0. /square
