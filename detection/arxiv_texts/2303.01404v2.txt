Abstract
We deﬁne even very stable Higgs bundles and study the Hitchin map restricted to their
upward ﬂows. In the GLncase we classify the type (1,...,1)examples, and ﬁnd that they are
governed by a root system formed by the roots of even height. W e discuss how the spectrum
of equivariant cohomology of real and quaternionic Grassma nnians,4n-spheres and the real
Cayley plane appear to describe the Hitchin map on even comin uscule upward ﬂows. The
even upward ﬂows in question are the same as upward ﬂows in Hig gs bundle moduli spaces
for quasi-split inner real forms. The latter spaces have bee n pioneered by Oscar Garc´ ıa-Prada
and his collaborators.
1 Introduction
This paper is a write-up of the second author’s talk [ 12] at the conference ”Moduli spaces and
geometric structures” in honour of Oscar Garc´ ıa-Prada on t he occasion of his 60th birthday at
ICMAT Madrid in September 2022.
In [14], motivated by mirror symmetry, the notion of very stable Hi ggs bundle was intro-
duced. Let Cbe a smooth projective curve. Let Mdenote the moduli space of rank nde-
greedsemistable Higgs bundles (E,Φ), where Eis a rank ndegree vector bundle and Φ∈
H0(C;End(E)⊗K)is a Higgs ﬁeld. There is a T-action on Mby scaling the Higgs ﬁeld, i.e.
λ∈Tacts by sending (E,Φ)to(E,λΦ). A ﬁxed point E ∈ MsTis called very stable , if the upward
ﬂow
W+
E:={F ∈ M : lim
λ→0λ·F=E} ⊂ M
is closed. In Section 2we recall the basic properties of very stable upward ﬂows in g eneral as
well as for the the moduli space of Higgs bundles M.
One of the main results of [ 14] is the classiﬁcation of very stable Higgs bundles (E,Φ)∈ MT
of type(1,...,1). A ﬁxed point is of type (1,...,1)when the vector bundle E=L0⊕···⊕Ln−1
is a direct sum of line bundles, and the Higgs ﬁeld Φ|Li:Li→Li+1K⊂EK, which we denote
by
bi:= Φ|Li∈Hom(Li,Li+1K)∼=H0(C;L−1
iLi+1K).
Then we have
Theorem 1.1 ([14, Theorem 4.16]) .The type(1,...,1)Higgs bundle (E,Φ)∈ MTis very stable if and
only if the divisor div(b1)+···+div(bn−1)is reduced.
12
We recall this classiﬁcation in Theorem 2.11 below, and a reformulation of it in Remark 2.12
in terms of minuscule dominant weights of GL(n,C).
Garcia-Prada and Ramanan in [ 9] study involutions on the moduli space of Higgs bundles.
One important involution θ:M → M is given by θ(E,Φ) := (E,−Φ). In [ 9] it is shown that
the ﬁxed points Mθcorrespond to U(p,n−p)-Higgs bundles (including the case p= 0, where
U(0,n) :=U(n)). We recall these notions in Section 3.
In this paper we will be interested in the so-called even upward ﬂows W2+
Efor anyE ∈ MsT⊂
Mθwhich are deﬁned to be the upward ﬂows Ein the semi-projective Mθ, or equivalently, the
intersection W2+
E:=W+
E∩Mθ. Then we can deﬁne even very stable Higgs bundles E ∈ MTfor
which the even upward ﬂow W2+
E⊂ Mθis closed. One of the main results of this paper is the
following
Theorem 1.2. The type(1,...,1)Higgs bundle (E,Φ)∈ MTis even very stable, if and only if the divisors
div(b2)+···+div(bn−2)anddiv(bi)+div(bi+2k+1)for1≤i≤i+2k+1≤n−1are all reduced.
To clarify the meaning of this complicated looking set of div isors, we reformulate this theorem
in Theorem 3.13 in terms of so-called even minuscule dominant weights using positive weights of
even height.
As the Hitchin map restricted to very stable upward ﬂows is ﬁn ite ﬂat and T-equivariant
between afﬁne spaces, with positive T-action of the same dimension it is suspectible of explicit
description. In the type (1,...,1)very stable case, the second author found such an explicit
description in [ 13] in terms of the spectrum of equivariant cohomology of the Gr assmannian
Grk(Cn). We will recall this in Section 4.2below.
Finally in Section 4.3we study the problem of modelling the Hitchin map on certain e ven
very stable upward ﬂows, in terms of the equivariant cohomol ogy of homogeneous spaces. We
will ﬁnd in Theorem 4.3that forGL2nthe equivariant cohomology of quaternionic Grassmanni-
ans, forSO4n+2the equivariant cohomology of the 4n-sphere and ﬁnally for E6the equivariant
cohomology of the real Cayley plane should model the Hitchin map on some speciﬁc even very
stable ﬂows. The appearance of these symmetric spaces is int eresting, partly because they are not
of Hermitian type, and also because they are quotients of the Nadler group [ 22] of the quasi-split
real form of Hodge type (see [ 9, Section 2.3] for the deﬁnition).
In this paper we are concentrating on type (1,...,1)very stable and even very stable upward
ﬂows. By now there are many interesting results about other t ypes of very stable or wobbly Higgs
bundles see e.g. [ 20] for multiplicity algebras of type (2)very stable Higgs bundles, [ 6] for many
wobbly Higgs bundles - both papers in this conference procee dings - and [ 25] for a classiﬁcation
of all type (n1,n2)very stable components.

2 Bialynicki-Birula decomposition
In this section we ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of a semi-projec tive variety and then collect the basics
of the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition associated to such a variety.3
Deﬁnition 2.1. LetXbe a normal complex quasi-projective variety equipped with aT:=C×
action.Xissemi-projective if the ﬁxed point locus XTis projective, and for every x∈Xthere is a
p∈XTsuch that lim
λ→0λx=p.
The latter is to be understood as the existence of a T-equivariant morphism f:A1→Xsuch
thatf(1) =xandf(0) =p. Semi-projective varieties are endowed with a stratiﬁcati on in afﬁne
subvarieties known as the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition [3], which we now recall. We refer to
[14, Section 2] for further details.
Deﬁnition 2.2. LetXbe a semi-projective variety and α∈XT. The upward ﬂow from αis deﬁned
to be
W+
α:={x∈X: lim
λ→0λx=α}.
Similarly, the downward ﬂow from αis
W−
α:={x∈X: lim
λ→∞λx=α}.
TheBialynicki-Birula partition isX=/unionsqtext
α∈XTW+
α. The coreofXis deﬁned to be C:=/unionsqtext
α∈XTW−
α.
Deﬁnition 2.3. For a connected component of the ﬁxed locus, F∈π0(XT), we deﬁne its attractor
asW+
F:=/uniontext
α∈FW+
α, and its repeller asW−
F:=/uniontext
α∈FW−
α. The Bialynicki-Birula decomposition is
X=/unionsqtext
F∈π0(XT)W+
F.
Given a smooth ﬁxed point α∈XsT, theT-action on Xinduces a representation of Ton the
tangent space TαX. We denote, for k∈Z, the weight space (TαX)k⊂TαXwhereλ∈Tacts via
multiplication by λk. This leads to a decomposition TαX=/circleplustext
k∈Z(TαX)kin weight spaces. We
denoteT+
αX:=/circleplustext
k>0(TαX)kthe positive part and T−
αX:=/circleplustext
k<0(TαX)kthe negative part. We
have:
Proposition 2.4. Given a smooth ﬁxed point α∈XsT, the upward ﬂow W+
α(resp. the downward ﬂow
W−
α) is a locally closed T-invariant subvariety of Xwhich is isomorphic to T+
αX(resp.T−
αX) as varieties
withT-action.
The proof was originally given in [ 3] for smooth complete X. A proof for the general case is
given in [ 14, Proposition 2.1].
Finally, suppose further that Xsis equipped with a symplectic form ω∈Ω2(Xs)such that,
forλ∈T, we have λ∗(ω) =λω. This supposition is motivated by the fact that the semi-pro jective
variety we will be studying, the moduli space of semistable H iggs bundles, is endowed with such
a form. Then, we have:
Proposition 2.5. For a smooth point α∈XsT, the subspaces T+
αXandT≤0
αX:= (TαX)0⊕T−
αXof
TαXare Lagrangian. Moreover, the subvarieties W+
αandW−
Fαare also Lagrangian.
The proof is given in [ 14, Proposition 2.10]. The main idea is that, for v∈(TαX)kandw∈
(TαX)l, we have
λω(v,w) =λ∗(ω)(v,w) =ω(λ·v,λ·w) =ω(λkv,λlw) =λk+lω(v,w),
so thatω(v,w)can only be nonzero in the situation k+l= 1, which does not happen if k,l >0
or ifk,l≤0.
Deﬁnition 2.6. We say that α∈XsTisvery stable ifW+
α∩C={α}.
This deﬁnition was introduced in [ 14, Deﬁnition 4.1], where it was proven [ 14, Lemma 4.4]
thatα∈XsTis very stable if and only if W+
α⊂Xis closed.4
2.1 Lagrangian upward ﬂows in M
In this section we introduce Higgs bundles and show how the pr evious theory of Bialynicki-
Birula applies to the moduli space of semistable Higgs bundl es. For this, we ﬁx a smooth projec-
tive curve Cover the complex numbers with genus g≥2and canonical line bundle K.
Deﬁnition 2.7. AHiggs bundle is a pair (E,Φ)whereEis a holomorphic vector bundle over C
andΦ∈H0(C,End(E)⊗K).
Such an object can be deﬁned in more generality for a real redu ctive Lie group G[7, Deﬁnition
3.1], giving G-Higgs bundles. The above deﬁnition is recovered by setting G=GLn(C)forn=
rankE. Recall that a Higgs bundle (E,Φ)isstable if, for every nonzero proper vector subbundle
F⊂Esuch that Φ(F)⊆F⊗K, we have
µ(F) :=degF
rankF< µ(E) :=degE
rankE,
and it is semistable if for the same subbundles we have µ(F)≤µ(E). We denote by M:=Md
n
the moduli space of semistable Higgs bundles of ﬁxed rank nand degree d. It was constructed
via gauge theory in [ 18] and by algebraic geometric methods in [ 23,27]. It is a normal [ 28] quasi-
projective variety with a hyperk¨ ahler metric at its smooth points, which are the stable Higgs
bundles. In particular, it has a symplectic structure ω∈Ω2(Ms).
This space also carries a natural T-action deﬁned by (E,Φ)/mapsto→(E,λΦ)which turns it into
a semi-projective variety and such that λ∗(ω) =λω. Thus, the Bialynicki-Birula theory from the
previous section applies. The ﬁxed locus MTcan be identiﬁed as follows. We have, for any λ∈T,
an isomorphism of vector bundles fλ∈Aut(E)such that
Φ◦fλ=fλ◦(λΦ). (2.1)
In other words, we have an action of TonEwhich is linear on each ﬁber. Hence we can
decompose E=L0⊕ ··· ⊕Lkinto weight spaces, where fλ|Li=λwi·IdLi. The compatibility
condition ( 2.1) shows that, if vi∈Li, thenfλ(λ·Φ(vi)) = Φ(fλ(vi)) =λwiΦ(vi), thusfλ(Φ(vi)) =
λwi−1Φ(vi). Hence, Φmaps the space for weight wiinto the space for weight wi−1. In particular,
the weights can be chosen to be of the form wi=w0−iand the Higgs ﬁeld has the property
Φ(Li)⊆Li+1⊗K. From this, we can associate an invariant (rankL0,...,rankLk)to the ﬁxed
point, known as the type.
The previous decomposition shows that, in fact, a Higgs bund le ﬁxed by the T-action is nilpo-
tent, since Φk+1≡0. Another way of seeing this is via the Hitchin map :
h:M → A :=n/circleplusdisplay
i=1H0(C,Ki)
deﬁned by the coefﬁcients ai∈H0(C,Ki)of the characteristic polynomial det(Φ−xIn) =xn+/summationtextn
j=1ajxn−j. This map is a proper, completely integrable Hamiltonian sy stem [ 17,23] whose
ﬁbers are Lagrangian at their smooth points, and the generic ﬁbers are abelian varieties [ 26].
Moreover, by letting Tact onH0(C,Ki)with weight i, the Hitchin map is T-equivariant. Thus,
MT⊆h−1(0)so that ﬁxed points (E,Φ)have characteristic polynomial xnand are nilpotent.
The upward and downward ﬂows from the Bialynicki-Birula par tition have been character-
ized in [ 14, Proposition 3.4 and 3.11]:
Proposition 2.8. LetE= (E′,Φ′)∈ MsTand(E,Φ)∈ M . We have (E′,Φ′)∈W+
Eif and only if
there exists a ﬁltration
0 =E0⊂E1⊂ ··· ⊂Ek=E5
such that Φ(Ei)⊆Ei+1⊗Kand the associated graded object veriﬁes (GrE,Gr(Φ))≃(E′,Φ′). The
same is true replacing W+
EwithW−
Eand the ascending ﬁltration with a descending ﬁltration.
The downward ﬂows have a concrete characterization via the H itchin map. Since the action
ofTonAis by positive weights, the core is just CA={0}. Because hisT-equivariant, this
shows that C:=CM⊂h−1(0). On the other hand, the properness of hshows that h−1(0)is
projective and thus C=h−1(0). This is typically called the nilpotent cone in this context. Notice
thatT-equivariance of himpliesMT⊆ C. From this, the notion of being very stable becomes:
Deﬁnition 2.9. A Higgs bundle E= (E,Φ)∈ MsTisvery stable if the only nilpotent Higgs bundle
inW+
EisEitself. Otherwise, it is wobbly .
One interesting aspect of such objects is that the Hitchin ma p restricts nicely to the upward
ﬂow [ 14, Lemma 4.6]:
Proposition 2.10. IfE ∈ MsTis very stable then h:W+
E→ A is ﬁnite, ﬂat, surjective and generically
´ etale.
2.2 Examples of very stable Higgs bundles
In this section we recall from [ 14] some examples of very stable Higgs bundles. First we consid er
the ﬁxed point component of type (n). The ﬁxed points of this type are elements of the form (E,0)
withEa semistable Higgs bundle. Thus, this component is just the m oduli space of semistable
rankndegreedvector bundles, N. The upward ﬂow for E= (E,0)is given by W+
E={(E,Φ) :
Φ∈H0(C,End(E)⊗K)}, so that Eis very stable if and only if the only nilpotent Higgs ﬁeld
Φ∈H0(C,End(E)⊗K)it admits is Φ≡0. This is the notion of very stable vector bundle
introduced by Drinfeld and Laumon [ 21], for which they prove that very stable bundles form an
open dense subset of the component.
Next, we shall focus on the type (1,1,...,1)case. The starting example of very stable Higgs
bundle in this component is the canonical uniformising Higgs bundle ,E0= (E0,Φ0), where
E0=O⊕K−1⊕···⊕K1−n,
and, given a= (a1,...,a n)∈ A=H0(C,K)⊕···⊕H0(C,Kn), the Higgs ﬁeld
Φa=
0 0...0an
1 0...0an−1
0 1...0an−2
...............
0 0...1a1

is given by the companion matrix. The map a/mapsto→(E0,Φa)provides a section of the Hitchin map,
known as the Hitchin section [19]. By means of Proposition 2.8, it follows that {(E0,Φa) :a∈
A} ⊆W+
E0. Moreover, since both are afﬁne spaces of equal dimension dimM/2, the upward ﬂow
is precisely the Hitchin section, hence E0is very stable.
It is possible to completely classify very stable Higgs bund les of this type by starting with this
example and performing Hecke transformations. First we not e that the data of a type (1,1,...,1)
ﬁxed point is equivalent to the choice of a line bundle L0overC(that is, a divisor δ0up to
principal divisor), as well as effective divisors δ1,...,δ n−1onC. Indeed, such a ﬁxed point (E,Φ)
is of the form E=L0⊕··· ⊕Ln−1, where for all jwe have rankLj= 1, andΦ|Lj−1=bj−1for
nonconstant maps bj:Lj−1→Lj⊗K,1≤j≤n−1. Thus,L0is given, and δiis obtained as the
zero locus of biwith multiplicities. On the other hand, given (δ0,δ1,...,δ n−1)we construct Eby6
settingLi:=L0⊗O(δ1+···+δi−1)⊗K−iandbi:=sδi∈ O(δi) =O(L∗
j−1⊗Lj⊗K)the canonical
section. We shall denote the bundle corresponding to δ:= (δ0,...,δ n−1)byEδ= (Eδ,Φδ).
Another convenient way of labelling these points is via choo sing a dominant weight of GL(n,C)
at each point of C, that is, a map
µ:C→Λ+(GL(n,C)) =/braceleftiggn/summationdisplay
i=1aiωi:a∈Zn−1
≥0×Z/bracerightigg
,
where the ωiare the fundamental weights. We require that the set C\{µ= 0}is ﬁnite. We then
deﬁne
δµ:=

c∈C/a\}bracketle{tµ(c),ω∨

i=1,...,n−1
,
andEµ:=Eδµ. Conversely, we can retrieve the map µfromδas
µδ(c) =δ0(c)ωn+n−1/summationdisplay
i=1δi(c)ωi∈Λ+,
whereD(c)for a divisor Dmeans the coefﬁcient of cinD.
2.3 Hecke transformations
Now we explain Hecke transformations for Higgs bundles. The se play a key role since they al-
low to relate the upward ﬂows of the different ﬁxed points in t he type(1,1,...,1)component. In
order to deﬁne Hecke transformations of (E,Φ), we start by choosing a point c∈Cand a sub-
spaceV∈Gr(k,E|c)which is Φ|c-invariant, that is, Φ|c(V)⊂V⊗K|c. The Hecke transformation
HV(E,Φ) := (E′,Φ′)is deﬁned by diagram
0→E′→E→E|c/V→0
Φ′↓ Φ↓ Φc↓
0→E′⊗K→E⊗K→E|c/V⊗K→0,
whereE|c/Vis to be regarded as a skyscraper sheaf at c. More details of the construction of this
diagram can be found in [ 14, Deﬁnition 4.10].
It is possible to reach any Eµfrom successive Hecke transformations that start at E0. This is
due to the following fundamental operation: starting with E0and selecting the natural invariant
subspace Vk= (Lk⊕···⊕Ln−1)|c, the resulting Hecke transformation gives Eµc,k, whereµc,k(c) =
ωkand zero otherwise. This is explained in [ 14, Example 4.13]. For arbitrary µit sufﬁces to iterate
the previous operation for every c∈C, at theωkindicated by µ(c). One of the main results of
[14]is that the upward ﬂows are also related by Hecke transformat ions, from which the following
classiﬁcation can be deduced:
Theorem 2.11 ([14, Theorem 4.16]) .A stable ﬁxed point of type (1,1,...,1),(Eδ,Φδ)∈ MsT, is very
stable if and only if the divisor δ1+···+δn−1is reduced.
Remark 2.12.The previous statement can be rephrased as (Eµ,Φµ)being very stable if and only
if for every c∈C, eitherµ(c) =anωnorµ(c) =anωn+ωkwherek∈ {1,...,n−1}and
an∈Z. In other words, the point is very stable if and only if for eve ryc∈C, the weight
µ(c)isminuscule , that is, minimal with respect to the partial ordering in Λ+(GL(n,C))given by
µ1≥µ2⇐⇒µ1−µ2∈Φ+={/summationtext
α∈∆+aαα:aα∈Z≥0}, where∆+denotes the set of positive
roots.7
3 Even very stable upward ﬂows
In this section we extend the results summarized above to the subspace Mθ⊂ M of the moduli
space deﬁned by the ﬁxed points of the subgroup C2={1,−1} ⊆T, acting as the involution
θ: (E,Φ)/mapsto→(E,−Φ). Clearly, this subspace contains all the ﬁxed points by the T-action, so
the previous concepts can be extended naturally. Moreover, by [9, Theorem 6.3], the space Mθ
contains the images of the maps MU(p,q)→ M , given by extension of structure group, of the
moduli spaces of U(p,q)-Higgs bundles (for the different U(p,q)withp+q=n,p≤q) into
the moduli space of GL(n,C)-Higgs bundles. The stable locus Mθ,sis covered by these images,
which are the Higgs bundles that we will consider.
We start by recalling the following deﬁnition from [ 4, Deﬁnition 3.3].
Deﬁnition 3.1. AU(p,q)-Higgs bundle (E,Φ)is a holomorphic vector bundle Eof the form E=
V⊕W, whereVandWare vector bundles of ranks pandq, respectively, and Φ∈H0(End(E)⊗K)
is a section satisfying Φ(V)⊂W⊗K,Φ(W)⊂V⊗K.
We denote by Ms
U(p,q)the moduli space of stable U(p,q)-Higgs bundles, where stability is
deﬁned as for GL(n,C)-Higgs bundles. As explained before, this space sits inside Mas the ﬁxed
point locus of the involution θ, that is, a stable Higgs bundle (E,Φ)is aU(p,q)-Higgs bundle (for
somepandq) if and only if (E,Φ)≃(E,−Φ)[9, Theorem 6.3]. We will often use interchangeably
the moduli space MU(p,q)and its image inside M.
Note that every ﬁxed point E= (E,Φ)of the T-action is in particular ﬁxed by −1and hence a
U(p,q)-Higgs bundle for some pandq. This can be seen more explicitly by observing that, in the
decomposition E=E0⊕···⊕Ek−1withΦ(Ei)⊂Ei+1⊗K, the Higgs ﬁeld Φinterchanges the
summands with odd indices by those of even indices. In partic ular, type (1,1,...,1)ﬁxed points
are Higgs bundles for the quasi-split group U(p,p)orU(p,p+1) .
Moreover, recall from Białynicki-Birula theory in Section 2that the upward ﬂow W+
Eis an
afﬁne space isomorphic to the subspace of positive weights T+
EM ⊂TEM. It is easy to identify
the subspace of U(p,q)-Higgs bundles.
Remark 3.2.TheU(p,q)-Higgs bundles in W+
E, that is,MU(p,q)∩W+
E, correspond via the isomor-
phismW+
E≃T+
EMto the vector subspace of positive, even weightsT2+
EM ⊂TEM.
This is because the even weights are precisely the vector sub space ﬁxed by multiplication by
−1, and the previous isomorphism is T-equivariant. In other words, we can view the locus of
U(p,q)-Higgs bundles at the upward ﬂow of a ﬁxed point as a subspace:
Deﬁnition 3.3. The even upward ﬂow atEis the subspace of W+
Ecorresponding to T2+
EMand is
denoted by W2+
E.
Note that this coincides with the standard upward ﬂow when de ﬁned inMθinstead of M.
Hence, we also have the following natural deﬁnition of very s table points:
Deﬁnition 3.4. We say that Eiseven very stable ifW2+
E∩C={E}, whereC=h−1(0)⊆ M denotes
the locus of nilpotent Higgs bundles. Otherwise, it is said t o be even wobbly .
We remark, as one of the main interests for this study, that th e subspaces of even weights
T2
EM ⊂TEMthat we are considering are Lagrangian, since the symplecti c formωpairs the
subspace of weight kwith that of 1−k, as explained at the end of Section 2, so that the subspaces
of even weights are paired with those of odd weights. In fact, the subvariety Mθ⊂ M itself is
Lagrangian, as explained in [ 9, Theorem 8.10].
Obviously, a very stable ﬁxed point is also even very stable. However, a wobbly ﬁxed point
Ecan either remain even wobbly or instead be even very stable, depending on whether the non-
trivial intersection (W+
E∩C)\{E} happens at even weights or not. We will classify the even very8
stable Higgs bundles of type (1,1,...,1), revealing that both situations already arise in this case.
We follow the same notation of Subsection 2.2.
Proposition 3.5. LetE= (E,Φ)be a smooth ﬁxed point of type (1,1,...,1). Suppose that there is some
pointc∈Csuch that bi(c) =bj(c) = 0 for somei,jof different parity. Then Eis even wobbly.
Proof. The proof follows the approach of constructing a curve via He cke transformations fol-
lowed in the proof of [ 14, Theorem 4.16]. We will see that, in this situation, the curv e can be
constructed along even weights. We have that bk(c) =bk+l(c) = 0 wherel >0and odd. We start
by performing a Hecke transformation at the Φc-invariant subspace (L0⊕ ··· ⊕Lk−1)|c⊂E|c,
yielding
E′=L0⊕···⊕Lk−1⊕Lk(−c)⊕···⊕Ln−1(−c),

wheresc∈H0(O(c))is the canonical section. This bundle is still stable [ 14, Lemma 4.17]. We
have that V0= (Lk(−c)⊕···⊕Ln−1(−c))|c⊂E′|cis the(n−k)-dimensional Φ′
c-invariant subspace
that transforms (E′,Φ′)back into (E(−c),Φ). Now let {v0,...,v n−1}be a basis of E′|c, eachvj
taken in the corresponding component. We deﬁne the followin g(n−k)-dimensional subspace:
V:=/a\}bracketle{tvk−1+vk+l,vk,vk+1,...,v k+l−1,vk+l+1,vn−1/a\}bracketri}ht ⊂E′|c
This is another Φ′
c-invariant subspace, since Φ′

c(vm)∈ /a\}bracketle{tvm+1/a\}bracketri}ht
form∈ {k,...,k+l−2}∪{k+l+ 1,...,n−1}, andΦ′
c(vk+l−1) = 0 (in this analysis we take
vj= 0for anyj > n−1). Now, recall that there is an induced T-action on Grn−k(E′|c)given by
theT-action on E′with weight −ion thei-th summand of E′. With this, given λ∈Twe deﬁne
Vλ:=λV, that is:
Vλ=/angbracketleftbig

Note that this subspace is always n−kdimensional. This yields a curve within the con-
nected subvariety Sn−k(Φ′|c)⊂Grn−k(E′|c)of vector subspaces of the ﬁber E′|cwhich are in-
variant by Φ′|c. As argued in the proof of [ 14, Theorem 4.16], this translates into a curve in
the moduli space of Higgs bundles, deﬁned by HVλ(E′,Φ′)≃λHV(E′,Φ′). This curve con-
nectsHV0(E′,Φ′) = (E(−c),Φ)with a different ﬁxed point, given by HV∞(E′,Φ′), whereV∞=
/a\}bracketle{tvk−1,vk,vk+1,...,v k+l−1,vk+l+1,vn−1/a\}bracketri}ht. This ﬁxed point is also stable [ 14, Lemma 4.18].
Moreover, since lis odd, then l+1is even and we have that Vλ=V−λ, henceλHV(E′,Φ′)≃
−λHV(E′,Φ′)so that this curve is ﬁxed by the action of −1and hence it lies in W2+
(E(−c),Φ). This
shows that (E(−c),Φ)is even wobbly thus (E,Φ)as well.
There are still more examples of even wobbly stable Higgs bun dles of type (1,1,...,1), which
are covered by the following proposition.
Proposition 3.6. LetE= (E,Φ)be a smooth ﬁxed point of rank n≥4. Suppose that b:=bn−2◦···◦b2
has a multiple zero at c∈C. ThenEis even wobbly.9
Proof. The proof is identical to that of Proposition 3.5, with the only difference being the construc-
tion of the invariant subspace V∈Sn−k(Φ′|c).
Let1< i1< i2<···< im< n−1be all the indices other than 1andn−1such that bik(c) = 0 .
We can assume that all of them are of the same parity since othe rwise we apply the previous
proposition. We start again with a Hecke transform at (L0⊕L1···⊕Lim−1)|c. This yields (E′,Φ′)
with the same form as in the proof of Proposition 3.5.
Now we will construct a basis {v0,v1,...,v n−1}ofE′|cas follows. We start with any nonzero
v0∈L′
0|c, then apply Φ′|cuntil a zero vector is obtained. This will produce a string :v1= Φ′|c(v0),
v2= Φ′|c(v1)...all the way up to vi1−1, ifb1(c)/\e}atio\slash= 0, or just v0ifb1(c) = 0 . The process then
iterates: we pick vi1(orv1ifb1(c) = 0 ) nonzero in the corresponding summand and iterate,
repeating until vn−1. By construction, the basis is partitioned in strings insid e of which each
element maps to the next one and the last one maps to zero. Also , eachviis in the corresponding
summand L′
i|c. LetV0=/a\}bracketle{tvim,...,v n−1/a\}bracketri}ht.
Now recall that im< n−1andi1≥2. Note that if m= 1, it is possible that i1=im, meaning
a multiple zero of bi1atc. In any case, we deﬁne the following (n−im)-dimensional subspace:
V=/a\}bracketle{tvim+vi1−2,vim+1+vi1−1,vim+2,...,v im+i1−1,vim+i1,...,v n−1/a\}bracketri}ht.
It isΦ′|c-invariant: each generator is taken to the next, and the last one to zero. Notice that it
is important that im< n−1since otherwise we get a 1-dimensional space that does not work,
for/a\}bracketle{tvim+vi1−2/a\}bracketri}ht /mapsto→ /a\}bracketle{tvi1−1/a\}bracketri}ht. Also notice that if bn−1(c) = 0 then the second generator might map
to zero instead of vim+2, but this is not a problem for the invariance. We compute λV:
V=/angbracketleftbig
vim+λim−i1+2vi1−2,vim+1+λim−i1+2vi1−1,vim+2,...,v im+i1−1,vim+i1,...,v n−1/angbracketrightbig
.
Once again this gives a curve in Sn−k(Φ′|c)connecting V0with a different V∞such that the
Hecke transform is a new ﬁxed point and, since im−i1+2is even, it follows that λV=−λV, as
desired.
We now prove that these constitute all even wobbly cases.
Proposition 3.7. LetEδ= (E,Φ)be a smooth ﬁxed point of type (1,1,...,1). Suppose that for every
c∈Cwe have that bi(c) =bj(c) = 0 impliesi≡jmod 2 , andbn−2◦···◦b2has at most a single zero
atc. Then,Eis even very stable.
Proof. We argue by induction on deg(δn−1+···+δ1), as we already know from Section 2.2that the
degree0case, which is the canonical uniformising Higgs bundle, is e ven very stable. Suppose
that(E′,Φ′)∈W+
E∩Cis a nilpotent element in the upward ﬂow of E, with the full ﬁltration
0 =W0⊂W1⊂ ··· ⊂Wn−1⊂Wn=E′
given by Proposition 2.8. Take one of the points c∈Cwithµδ(c)/\e}atio\slash= 0, and suppose ﬁrst that
bn−1(c) = 0 . This means that V′:= (Wn−1)|cisΦ′|c-invariant, and, as explained in [ 14, Section
4], the Hecke transformation (E′
1,Φ′
1) =HV′(E′,Φ′)is stable, nilpotent and lies in the upward
ﬂow of(E1,Φ1) :=HV(E,Φ), whereV= (L0⊕ ··· ⊕Ln−2)|c⊆E|c. We have that (E1,Φ1)is
another type (1,1,...,1)point given by δ1= (δ1
0,...,δ1
n−1)with the only difference being that
δ1
n−1=δn−1−c. Thus, by the induction hypothesis it follows that (E1,Φ1)is even very stable,
which results in the following two options:
• If(E′
1,Φ′
1)/\e}atio\slash≃(E1,Φ1), since the latter is even very stable, we have that (E′
1,Φ′
1)lies in
an odd weight space of T(E1,Φ1)Mand, by using the invariant subspaces V′
1⊆E′
1|cand
V1⊆E1|csuch that HV′
1(E′
1,Φ′
1) = (E′,Φ′)andHV1(E1,Φ1) = (E,Φ)(up to twisting by a
ﬁxed line bundle), it follows that (E′,Φ′)also has odd weight in the upward ﬂow for (E,Φ)
and hence (E′,Φ′)/∈W2+
Eδ.10
• If(E′
1,Φ′
1)≃(E1,Φ1), then the one dimensional subspace V′
1⊆E′
1|csuch that HV′
1(E′
1,Φ′
1) =
(E′,Φ′)is one of the Φ1|c-invariant subspaces in the pair (E1,Φ1), which we know well
since it comes from a Hecke transformation of the starting (E,Φ). Indeed, we have:
E1=L0⊕···⊕Ln−2⊕Ln−1(−c),
Φ1=
0 0...0 0 0
b10...0 0 0
0b2...0 0 0
..................
0 0... b n−20 0
0 0...0bn−1
sc0
.
LetV={v0,...,v n−1}be a basis of E1|c. From the starting hypotheses about (E,Φ), the
only basis vectors that could vanish via Φ1|care{v0,vj−1,vn−2,vn−1}wherejis the only
index with 2≤j≤n−2such that bj(c) = 0 , if it exists. Necessarily, j≡n−1 mod 2 . Also,
ifv0vanishes then b1(c) = 0 and hence n≡0 mod 2 . Finally, vn−2vanishes if and only if
bn−1had a multiple zero at c.
SinceΦ1is nilpotent, the desired invariant 1-dimensional subspace must be of the form
V′
1=/a\}bracketle{tv/a\}bracketri}htwhereΦ1|c(v) = 0 , that is,v=αv0+βvj−1+γvn−2+δvn−1. Moreover,
λ·V′
1=/angbracketleftbig
αλn−1v0+βλn−jvj−1+γλvn−2+δvn−1/angbracketrightbig
must verify that lim
λ→0λV′
1=V1=/a\}bracketle{tvn−1/a\}bracketri}ht, which implies that δ/\e}atio\slash= 0. Hence, because of the
parity of the exponents of λappearing in the expression for λ·V′
1, if(E′,Φ′) =HV′
1(E′
1,Φ′
1)
were in an even weight space, that is, if λ·V′
1=−λ·V′
1, it would be necessary that α=β=
γ= 0, thusV′
1=V1, meaning (E′,Φ′)≃(E,Φ).
This concludes the analysis for the bn−1(c) = 0 case. Now, if bn−1(c)/\e}atio\slash= 0, we may also assume
thatb1(c)/\e}atio\slash= 0. This is because the involution (E,Φ)/mapsto→(E∗,Φt)ofMnaturally bijects ﬁxed
points and upward ﬂows, sending a point with b1(c) = 0 to a point with bn−1(c) = 0 . Hence,
the remaining case is when the only bj(c) = 0 happens at a single jwith2≤j≤n−2and
multiplicity one. This case is treated exactly as in the proo f of [ 14, Theorem 4.16], which we now
recall.
We have the Φ′|c-invariant j-dimensional subspace V′:= (Wj−1)|cgiving a nilpotent (E′
1,Φ′
1) =
HV′(E′,Φ′)in the upward ﬂow of (E1,Φ1) = (E1,Φ1) :=HV(E,Φ), whereV= (L0⊕ ··· ⊕
Lj−1)|c⊆E|c. Exactly as before, if (E′
1,Φ′
1)/\e}atio\slash≃(E1,Φ1), the induction hypothesis gives (E′,Φ′)/∈
W2+
Eδ. Otherwise, notice that Φ′
1|cis now a regular nilpotent, so the only Φ′
1|c-invariant (n−j)-
dimensional subspace is V′
1=V1= (Lj⊕···⊕Ln−1)|c. Hence (up to tensoring everything by a
ﬁxed line bundle) we have (E′,Φ′) =HV1(E1,Φ1) = (E,Φ).
3.1 Even minuscule weights in GL(n,C)
We will now see how the conditions found before arise natural ly in the context of the root system
of the structure group GL(n,C)ofE. We have ω1,...,ω n−1,ωn∈Λ+the fundamental weights.
Recall that the height of a root is the number of simple roots in its decomposition. I n terms
of the fundamental weights the positive roots of height k∈ {1,...,n−1}can be indexed by
p∈ {1,...,n−k}and given by:
αk,p:=−ωp−1+ωp+ωp+k−1−ωp+k,11
whereω0is understood as 0. In particular, the simple roots are the positive roots of he ight1of
the form α1,p=−ωp−1+2ωp−ωp+1forp= 1,...,n−1. The highest root αn−1,1=ω1+ωn−1−ωn
has height n−1.
Deﬁnition 3.8. For dominant weights λ,µ, we deﬁne the even partial ordering as
λ≥2µ⇐⇒λ−µ∈Φ2+,
where
Φ2+=

/summationdisplay
keven,
1≤p≤n−kck,pαk,p:ck,p∈Z≥0


is the set of positive linear combinations of even positive r oots. Minimal elements for this order-
ing are called even minuscule .
We will say for a weight λthat itsi-th coordinate/entry ,λi, is the coefﬁcient of ωiwhenλ
is written in the basis {ω1,...,ω n}. The position of thei-thcoordinate will be just i. Now we
will characterize the even minuscule weights, seeing that t he conditions exactly match those for
even very stable Higgs bundles. The characterization will b e carried out solely via combinatorial
arguments.
Proposition 3.9. Letλbe a dominant weight such that at least one of these holds:
1. The weight λhas nonzero coordinates at two positions 1≤i < j≤n−1withi/\e}atio\slash≡jmod 2 .
2. The weight λveriﬁesλ2+···+λn−2≥2.
Thenλis not even minuscule.
Proof. For the ﬁrst situation, if λhas nonzero coordinates at iandj, wherej−i:=kis an odd
positive number, then consider µ:=λ−αi,k+1. Because of the nonzero coordinates at iandjit
follows that µis dominant. By construction, µ < λ .
Ifλ2+···+λn−2≥2, choose indices i,jsuch that 2≤i≤j≤n−2with either i/\e}atio\slash=j
andλi,λj≥1, ori=jandλi≥2. We can assume the positions are of the same parity, since
otherwise we apply the previous. Hence write k:=j−ia nonnegative even number. Deﬁning
µ:=λ−(αk+2,i+αk+2,i−1)works as before, since αk+2,i+αk+2,i−1=−ωi−1+ωi+ωj+1−ωj+2−
ωi−2+ωi−1+ωj−ωj+1=−ωi−2+ωi+ωj−ωj+2.
Remark 3.10.Notice in the last part of the previous proof that 2≤i,j≤n−2is indeed required:
for example, if i= 1 we cannot take p=i−1 = 0 . Similarly we need for αk+2,ito make sense
thati≤n−(k−2) =n−k+2which is equivalent to j≤n−2.
As an example for the proof, take n= 9andλ= (0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0). Following the proof, we
can consider α6,2+α6,1= (−1,1,0,0,0,0,1,−1,0)+(1,0,0,0,0,1,−1,0,0)= (0,1,0,0,0,1,0,−1,0),
so thatµ= (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0)is lower than λ.
For the reciprocal, the combinatorial arguments will be eas ier if we stop considering ω0as
zero and rather see it as an extra linearly independent vecto r. That is, we view the weight space
W:=/a\}bracketle{tω1,...,ω n−1,ωn/a\}bracketri}htas a subspace of a new vector space /tildewiderW:=/a\}bracketle{tω0,ω1,...,ω n−1,ωn/a\}bracketri}htwhich is
a dimension higher. We have a projection π:/tildewiderW→W. We deﬁne/tildewideαk,p:=−ωp−1+ωp+ωp+k−1−
ωp+kas before but in /tildewiderW(i.e. we do not consider ω0= 0 in that expression anymore), so that
π(/tildewideαk,p) =αk,p. We also lift the even positive lattice as:12
/tildewideΦ2+=

/summationdisplay
keven,
1≤p≤n−kck,p/tildewideαk,p:ck,p∈Z≥0

,
so thatπ(/tildewideΦ2+) = Φ2+.
For example, in this new vector space the simple positive roo ts have the following lifts: /tildewideα1=
(−1,2,−1,0,0,...),/tildewideα2= (0,−1,2,−1,0,0,...)etcetera. As can be seen, this avoids the situation
of the negative coordinate being truncated at the beginning . In this setting we have the following
facts about/tildewideΦ2+, which will be the only ones we will need for our proof:
Lemma 3.11. Take a nonzero /tildewidex= (x0,x1,...,x n−1,xn)∈/tildewideΦ2+. We have:
1. The values x0andxnare not positive.
2. The valuesn/summationtext
j=0xj,/summationtext
jevenxjand/summationtext
joddxjare all zero.
3. The valuen−2/summationtext
j=2xjis not negative.
4. The ﬁrst and last nonzero coordinates of /tildewidexare negative.
Proof. Immediate, by induction on the number of positive even roots into which/tildewidexdecomposes.
First, it is clear that any /tildewideαk,pfor even khas all those properties. Second, it is easy to check that the
sum of any two vectors with those properties keeps satisfyin g them. Hence the result follows.
Proposition 3.12. Letλbe a dominant weight that is not even minuscule. Then at least one of these hold:
1. The weight λhas nonzero coordinates at two positions 1≤i < j≤n−1withi/\e}atio\slash≡jmod 2 .
2. The weight λveriﬁesλ2+···+λn−2≥2.
Proof. Takeµ < λ . Denote x:=λ−µ∈Λ2+. Sinceλ=x+µand the coordinates of µat positions
between 1andn−1are non negative, it sufﬁces to check that either xhas positive coordinates
at positions between 1andn−1of different parity, or that the sum of the positive coordina tes in
positions {2,...,n−2}ofx, which we shall denote Sfrom now on, veriﬁes S≥2.
In order to do this we can work with a lift /tildewidex∈/tildewideΛ2+ofxby lifting each of the positive even
roots in some decomposition. We will prove that /tildewidexhas at least one of the two desired properties,
and, since x0,xn≤0by Lemma 3.11, thenx=π(/tildewidex)will also have them and the proof will be
complete.
Assume that ˜xhas every positive coordinate between 1andn−1at even positions. We will
show that S/\e}atio\slash= 0andS/\e}atio\slash= 1, henceS≥2.
IfS= 0 this means there are no positive entries in positions {2,...,n−2}. By Lemma 3.11,
part3there are no negative entries either. So we have ˜x:= (x0,x1,0,...,0,xn−1,xn). Now if nis
even then by Lemma 3.11, part2we have x0+xn= 0 hencex0=xn= 0, the latter by Lemma
3.11, part1. But, since x1=−xn−1this contradicts Lemma 3.11, part4reaching a contradiction.
Ifnis odd then x0+xn−1= 0 andx1+xn= 0. By assumption that positive entries are in even
positions, we have x1=xn= 0and we reach the same contradiction.
IfS= 1there will be exactly one positive entry in positions {2,...,n−2}of value 1, say the
i-th one. By assumption iis even. By Lemma 3.11, part3, from positions 2ton−2there could
either be no negative entries or one negative entry of value −1at position j. Now a case by case
analysis follows.13
• Ifnis odd, the case jodd is excluded because we would get, summing odd entries, th at
x1+xn−1 = 0 and we have x1,xn≤0, the ﬁrst by assumption and the second by Lemma
3.11, part1. So we have x1=xn= 0and either jis even or there is no jat all. In either case
we ﬁnd, summing the even entries, that x0+xn−1∈ {0,−1}, from which it is impossible
that both are negative, contradicting Lemma 3.11, part4.
• Ifnis even, the case jodd is again excluded since, summing odd entries, we get x1+
xn−1−1 = 0 , but by assumption both x1andxn−1are not positive. Hence x1=xn−1= 0
andjis even or there is no jat all. In this case we have to distinguish: if there is no jthen
x0+xn=−1so both cannot be negative at the same time, and since the only other nonzero
entry is the 1at thei-th position, Lemma 3.11, part4is contradicted. If there is a jthen
x0+xn= 0, so thatx0=xn= 0and once again we have a contradiction with Lemma 3.11,
part4.
The only remaining task to complete the proof is to work out th e case where all positive
entries of ˜xare at odd positions instead of even ones. There is a symmetry in˜Φ2+viaωk/mapsto→ωn−k
that will change odd positions and even positions if nis odd. So the only remaining cases are for
evenn, which can be approached exactly the same as before:
• IfS= 0then the previous argument for even ndid not use the positions of positive entries
being even so it still works when they are odd.
• IfS= 1 we now have that iis odd. If jwere even, summing the even entries we get
x0+xn−1 = 0 which is not possible ( x0,xn≤0) so that jis either odd or does not exist.
If it is odd, we sum the odd entries to get x1+xn−1= 0, which yields a contradiction with
Lemma 3.11, part4. If it does not exist, we get x1+xn−1=−1, from which they cannot
both be negative and we reach the same contradiction.
Thus, we can rephrase the condition for even wobbliness as fo llows:
Theorem 3.13. Letµ:C→Λ+. ThenEµ∈ MsTis even very stable if and only if for every c∈C, the
dominant weight µ(c)is even minuscule.
As an example, the ﬁxed point in rank n= 4 associated to µ(c) =ω1+ω3andµ(d)/\e}atio\slash= 0 for
d/\e}atio\slash=cis even very stable, while being wobbly in the usual sense. In rankn= 2every ﬁxed point
is even very stable, which can be deduced more easily by the la ck of even weights in downward
ﬂows. This is because the only weights appearing in the upwar d ﬂows in rank n= 2 are those
appearing in the Hitchin base, which are 1and2. We then know that a negative weight kis paired
to a nonnegative one, 1−k, via the symplectic form ω, hence the only possible negative weight
isk=−1.
As a ﬁnal remark, it is possible to work with higher order auto morphisms deﬁned by (E,Φ)/mapsto→
(E,ζrΦ), whereζris a primitive r-th root of unity, giving subspaces Mr⊂ M and the corre-
sponding notions of r-very stable bundles. Most of the results presented here nat urally general-
ize to that situation (by using r-minuscule weights), however in this case there is no longer an
associated real group and the subspaces considered are not L agrangian.
4 Hitchin map on upward ﬂows
One important motivation to consider very stable upward ﬂow s in [ 14] was the observation that
the Hitchin map
hE:=h|W+
E:W+
E→ A14
restricted to them is proper. Furthermore W+
E∼=T+
EMasT-varieties. Thus in the very stable case
hEis a proper, even ﬁnite ﬂat [ 14, Lemma 4.6], T-equivariant morphism between semi-projective
afﬁne spaces of the same dimension. As such it is suspectible for explicit description.
4.1 Equivariant cohomology of homogeneous spaces
We will describe the Hitchin map explicitely on some very sta ble upward ﬂows in terms of equiv-
ariant cohomology. First we recall some of the basic propert ies of equivariant cohomology see
e.g. [ 1] for more details.
LetGbe a connected complex afﬁne (or compact Lie) group. Conside r the classifying G-
bundleEG→BG, whereEGis contractible. BGis called the classifying space, and its cohomol-
ogy ring can be computed as follows:
H∗
G:=H∗(BG;C)∼=H∗(BT;C)WG∼=C[t]WG,
wheret=Lie(T)is the Lie algebra of a maximal torus T⊂GandWGis the Weyl group of G.
Let now Gact on a variety (or manifold) X. We can form the Borel, or homotopy, quotient
XG:= (EG×X)/G, by the diagonal action of G, which is an X-bundle over BG. Its cohomology
ring is what is taken to be its equivariant cohomology
H∗
G(X;C) :=H∗(XG;C).
AsXGis anX-bundle over BGwe get a ring map H∗
G→H∗
G(X;C), making H∗
G(X;C)anH∗
G-
algebra.
Let now T<H<Gbe a connected closed subgroup containing the maximal torus Tof
G. Because EGis contractible, we have EG/H∼EH/Hso we can compute the G-equivariant
cohomology of the homogeneous space G/Has follows:
H∗
G(G/H;C)∼=H∗((EG×G/H)/G;C)∼=H∗(EG/H;C)∼=H∗
H,
with the ring map H∗
G→H∗
Hfrom the natural map BH→BGinduced from the embedding
H⊂G. This way we have a simple way to compute equivariant cohomol ogy of a homogeneous
space explicitly as in the following diagram of graded algeb ras:
H∗
G(G/H;C)∼=C[t]WH
↑ ↑
H∗
G∼=C[t]WG.(4.1)
Note that the structure maps above are ﬁnite free, meaning th at they deﬁne a ﬁnite free module.
This is because the equivariant cohomology of equal rank hom ogeneous spaces are equivariantly
formal [ 10, (1.2)], for example because they have no odd cohomology [ 11, Theorem VII, p. 467].
We will see below that on certain very stable upward ﬂows the H itchin map can be modelled
by the spectrum of equivariant cohomology of appropriate ho mogenous spaces. For this reason
we also take the spectrum of ( 4.1) and record the corresponding diagram:
Spec(H∗
G(G/H;C))∼=t/ /WH
↓ ↓
Spec(H∗
G)∼=t/ /WG.(4.2)
We note that half the grading on cohomology will induce the T-action on t/ /WH, which agrees
with the T-action induced from weight one action on t. The down arrows in the diagram then be-
come T-equivariant ﬁnite ﬂat (ultimately because of equivariant formality), in particular proper,
morphisms.15
Because we will also consider how certain involutions act on the equivariant cohomology of
homogeneous spaces, here we record the following lemma. To f ormulate it recall that for a unital
commutative ring Rwith2invertible and with involution θ:R→R, the coinvariant ring is
deﬁned as
Rθ:=R/(r−θ(r))r∈R∼=R/(r∈R:θ(r) =−r).
While if Ais a commutative R-algebra and θ:A→Aalso acts on A, compatibly with the
action on R, thenAθis naturally an Rθ-algebra, called the coinvariant algebra . Their relevance is
in forming the ﬁxed point scheme of the afﬁne R-scheme Spec(A)under the involution Spec(θ) :
Spec(A)→Spec(A), which we also denote by θ. We get that the ﬁxed point scheme
Spec(A)θ∼=Spec(Aθ) (4.3)
is an afﬁne Rθ-scheme. Using arguments from [ 24] we have the following
Lemma 4.1. LetGbe a connected complex reductive group (or a connected compa ct Lie group), and
τ: G→Ga complex algebraic (smooth) involution, with T⊂Gaτ-stable torus. Let Gτ
0denote the
identity component of the ﬁxed point group Gτ. Assume that
H∗
G։H∗
Gτ
0(4.4)
is surjecive. Let θ:=τ∗:H∗
G→H∗
Gdenote the induced action on the cohomology of BG. Then we have
that the coinvariant algebra
(H∗
G)θ∼=H∗
Gτ
0.
Moreover if T⊂H⊂Gis aτ-invariant closed connected subgroup, such that H∗
H։H∗
Hτ
0is surjective,
then we have the commutative diagram:
H∗
G(G/H;C)θ∼=(H∗
H)θ∼=H∗
Hτ
0∼=H∗
Gτ
0(Gτ
0/Hτ
0;C)
↑ ↑ ↑ ↑
(H∗
G)θ∼=(H∗
G)θ∼=H∗
Gτ
0∼= H∗
Gτ
0
Proof. We know that H∗
G∼=C[t]W, the algebra of invariant polynomials on tby the Weyl group W
ofG. By [ 29, Lemma 6.1] we can choose algebra generators p1,...,p rinC[t]Wsuchτ(pi) =ǫipi,
whereǫi=±1. By [ 29, Lemma 6.5] the generators with ǫi= 1 give the generators of C[tτ]Wτ,
whereWτis the subgroup of Wﬁxed by τ, itself a reﬂection group on tτ. Thus the number of
pi’s withǫi= 1is exactly the dimension of tτ, which in turn agrees with the rank of Gτ
0.
Finally, all pi’s withǫi=−1restrict trivially to tτ. Thus by the assumption ( 4.4) the restriction
of those with ǫi= 1 generate C[tτ]WGτ
0∼=H∗
Gτ
0, and as there are rank(Gτ
0)of them, they should
restrict algebraically independent. Thus the kernel of the surjection is generated by the anti-
invariant generators, showing the claim (H∗
G)θ∼=H∗
Gτ
0.
The second statement follows from the ﬁrst and ( 4.1).
Remark 4.2.The assumption of surjection ( 4.4) is quite restrictive. For simple Git only happens
[24, after (4.1)] for the symmetric pairs
(G,Gτ
0)∼=(SL2n+1,SO2n+1),(SL2n,Spn),(SO2n,SO2n−1),and(E6,F4).
All these examples will appear in § 4.3below.
4.2 Explicit Hitchin map on very stable upward ﬂows
First we recall from [ 13] how to describe hk:=hEkfor the very stable upward ﬂows W+
k:=W+
Ek
explicitly, where Ek:=Eµkc,c∈Cﬁxed and µk
c:C→Λ+is deﬁned by µk
c(c) =ωkand0
otherwise.16
Let us deﬁne the evaluation map at c∈C
evc:A →Cn
sending the characteristic polynomial (a1,...,a n)∈ A to
(a1(c),...,a n(c))∈K1
c×···×Kn
c∼=Cn
after identifying the ﬁber K∼=C. We can further identify
Cn∼=gln/ /GLn∼=tn/ /Sn∼=Spec(H∗(BGLn,C)),
wheregln=Lie(GLn)andtn=Lie(Tn)the Lie algebra of the maximal torus Tn⊂GLn, and the
symmetric group Snis the Weyl group of GLn. Then with the notation H∗
GLn:=H∗(BGLn;C)
for the cohomology ring of the classifying space BGLnwe have the following pull back diagram
from [ 13]
W+
k։Spec(H2∗
GLn(Grk(Cn),C))
hk↓/rightanglese ↓
Aevc։ Spec(H2∗
GLn),
where Gr k(Cn)is the Grassmannian of k-dimensional subspaces in Cnwith the usual action of
GLn. Additionally, all maps are T-equivariant with respect to the usual T-action on W+
k⊂ M
andA, and the one induced by the grading on H2∗
GLn(Grk(Cn);C)andH2∗
GLn. In other words the
Hitchin map hkcan be modelled by the equivariant cohomology of the Grassma nnianGrk(Cn).
4.3 Explicit Hitchin map on even very stable upward ﬂows
We can then ask what models the even Hitchin map hθ
k: W2+
k→ Aθ. We can note that θacts on
Mas−1∈Tin the natural T-action, thus we can induce an action of θonH2∗
GLn(Grk(Cn);C)and
H2∗
GLnas−1∈T. Therefore we have
W2+
k։Spec(H2∗
GLn(Grk(Cn),C))θ
hθ
k↓/rightanglese ↓
Aθevc։ Spec(H2∗
GLn)θ, (4.5)
and, as a result, the even Hitchin map hθ
kcan be modelled on the θ-ﬁxed point scheme
Spec(H2∗
GLn(Grk(Cn),C))θ.
For simplicity we will start with GL2nand an even number 0<2k <2n. To understand
the ﬁxed point scheme Spec(H2∗
GLn(Gr2k(C2n),C))θwe recall a presentation of the equivariant
cohomology of the Grassmannian. In practice it can be done by following through the restriction
of invariant polynomials in ( 4.1).
Lete1,...,e 2k,f1,...,f 2n−2k,c1,...,c 2nbe variables of degree given by their index. Then we
have the following presentation of the graded ring H2∗
GLn(Gr2k(C2n),C)∼=
C[e1,...,e 2k,f1,...,f 2n−2k,c1,...,c 2n]
((t2k+e1t2k−1+···+e2k)(t2n−2k+f1t2n−2k−1+···+f2n−2k)−(t2n+c1t2n−1+···+c2n)),
where the ideal is generated by the coefﬁcients of the given p olynomial in t. It is naturally an
algebra over H∗
GL2n∼=C[c1,...,c 2n]. The action of θis easy to ﬁgure out in this presentation,
namely, all elements of degree iwill get multiplied by (−1)i. To compute the ﬁxed point scheme17
(4.3) we will have to determine the coinvariant algebra of this θ-action. To form the coinvariant
algebra we add to the ideal the algebra elements which are act ed upon by θas−1, that is we
add the odd degree generators to the ideal. This way we get the following presentation of the
coinvariant algebra: H2∗
GL2n(Gr2k(C2n),C))θ∼=
C[e2,...,e 2k,f2,...,f 2n−2k,c2,...,c 2n]
((t2k+e2t2k−2+···+e2k)(t2n−2k+f2t2n−2k−2+···+f2n−2k)−(t2n+c2t2n−2+···+c2n)),
where all generators have even degree, and the ideal is gener ated by the coefﬁcients of the in-
dicated polynomial in t2. This is an algebra over C[c2,...,c 2n]which we can and will iden-
tify with H∗
Sp(n):=H∗(BSp(n),C)the cohomology ring of the classifying space of the compact
unitary symplectic group. In turn, we can identify H2∗
GL2n(Gr2k(C2n),C))θwith the equivariant
cohomology H∗
Sp(n)(Grk(Hn),C)of the quaternionic Grassmannian Gr k(Hn)ofk-dimensional H-
subspaces of Hn, which is a non-Hermitian compact homogeneous space isomor phic toSp(n)/Sp(k)×
Sp(n−k).
We can summarize our observation in the following diagram:
Spec(H2∗
GL2n(Gr2k(C2n),C))θ∼=Spec(H2∗
Sp(n)(Grk(Hn),C))
↓ ↓
Spec(H2∗
GL2n)θ ∼= Spec(H2∗
Sp(n))(4.6)
Thus, in light of ( 4.5), the Hitchin map hθ
2kon the even upward ﬂow W2+
2kcan be modelled by the
spectrum of the equivariant cohomology of the quaternionic Grassmannian Gr k(Hn).
In fact, we can ﬁnd similar coincidences of coinvariant alge bras of the equivariant cohomol-
ogy of cominuscule ﬂag varieties in some other types. Cominu scule ﬂag varieties correspond to
maximal parabolic subgroups associated to minuscule cowei ghts, or equivalently to simple roots,
which occur with coefﬁcient 1in the highest root (see also [ 14, §8] for more context). For example
we can consider the action of θon
H2∗
SO(4n+2)(SO(4n+2)/SO(2)×SO(4n),C) (4.7)
given by (−1)deg, wheredeg=∗is the degree of the grading on ( 4.7). The Hermitian symmetric
spaceSO(4n+2)/SO(2)×SO(4n)is an even quadric, a cominuscule ﬂag variety for the special
orthogonal group SO4n+2. The corresponding coinvariant algebra
H2∗
SO(4n+2)(SO(4n+2)/SO(2)×SO(4n),C)θ∼=H2∗
SO(4n+1)(SO(4n+1)/SO(4n),C),
can be identiﬁed with the SO(4n+1) -equivariant cohomology ring of the sphere
S4n∼=SO(4n+1)/SO(4n).
In fact we have the following diagram
H2∗
SO(4n+2)(SO(4n+2)/SO(2)×SO(4n),C)θ∼=H2∗
SO(4n+1)(SO(4n+1)/SO(4n),C)
↑ ↑/parenleftig
H2∗
SO(4n+2)/parenrightig
θ∼= H2∗
SO(4n+1).(4.8)
In other words we can expect that the Hitchin map on even comin uscule upward ﬂows in the
SO4n+2Higgs moduli space – equivalently the Hitchin map on cominus cule upward ﬂows in
theSO(2n+ 2,2n)-Higgs moduli space – to be modelled by the spectrum of the equ ivariant
cohomology of the sphere S4n.18
For our ﬁnal example we can consider the unique cominuscule ﬂ ag variety for the exceptional
E6. It is the complex Cayley plane E6/Spin(10) ×U(1) which is a compact Hermitian symmet-
ric space. We can identify the coinvariant algebra of the θ= (−1)degaction on its equivariant
cohomology ring:
H2∗
E6(E6/Spin(10) ×U(1),C)θ∼=H2∗
F4(F4/Spin(9),C)
↑ ↑/parenleftbig
H2∗
E6/parenrightbig
θ∼= H2∗
F4. (4.9)
Thus we expect to model the Hitchin map on even cominuscule up ward ﬂows in the E6Higgs
moduli space – equivalently on the cominuscule upward ﬂows i n theE6(2)-Higgs moduli space
– by the spectrum of equivariant cohomology of the real Cayle y planeF4/Spin(9) .
Mysteriously, in the above examples the symmetric spaces wh ose equivariant cohomology
we found to give the θ-coinvariant algebra of the equivariant cohomology of the c ominuscule
ﬂag variety are homogeneous spaces for the Nadler group [ 22, Table 1] of the corresponding
quasi-split real form of Hodge type. That is
U(n,n)∨∼=Spn,SO(2n+2,2n)∨∼=SO4n+1,andE∨
6(2)∼=F4.
Conjecturally, [ 2, §7] the Higgs bundle moduli space for the Nadler group shoul d give the sup-
port of the mirror of the Lagrangian brane given by the Higgs m oduli space attached to a real
form. However these appearances of the Nadler group remain t o be understood.
Even more surprising is that the Nadler groups in the above ex amples happen to be the ﬁxed
point subgroups of an involution of the ambient Langlands du al group. The corresponding
anti-holomorphic involution can then be used to construct [ 5] an anti-holomorphic involution
in the cominuscule ﬂag varieties in the above examples, and s how that the Lagrangian ﬁxed
point manifold is isomorphic to the corresponding non-Herm itian compact symmetric spaces we
have found above. Thus by uniformly denoting this anti-holo morphic involution by τwe get
that
Gr2k(C2n)τ∼=Grk(Hn)
(SO(4n+2)/SO(2)×SO(4n))τ∼=SO(4n+1)/SO(4n)
and
(E6/Spin(10) ×U(1))τ∼=F4/Spin(9).
Using Lemma 4.1it can be shown - by observing that precisely the even degree g enerators of
invariant polynomials survive for the τ-ﬁxed groups - that in each of these cases τinduces our
τ∗=θ= (−1)deg(4.10)
on equivariant cohomology, where again degis half the degree of a homogeneous cohomology
class. In turn, this observation and again Lemma 4.1can be used to geometrically prove our ﬁnal
Theorem 4.3. The diagrams in (4.6),(4.8),(4.9)commute and are induced by the involution τ.
Remark 4.4.Because of ( 4.10) we can deduce, by the Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem, that the sig-
natures of our Hermitian symmetric spaces X= G/Hagree
sign(X) =tr(θ:H∗(X)→H∗(X)) =χ(Xτ) (4.11)
with the Euler characteristic of the corresponding non-Her mitian symmetric spaces Xτ. The
quantity sign(X)is relevant in our considerations as it agrees with the rank o f the coinvariant19
algebraH∗
G(X)θ, which in turn should compute the multiplicity of the even Hi tchin map on the
corresponding even cominuscule upward ﬂow.
It is interesting to note that a very similar approach to ( 4.11) was studied in [ 16, Remark (1)
p.337 ] to determine the signature of our Hermitian symmetri c spaces as the Euler characteristic
ofXσ, using the involution σ:X→Xinduced by the split real form - instead of our real form
given by the Nadler group. The ﬁxed point sets are different i n the type A-case - certain real
Grassmannians - from our quaternionic Grassmannians but th e induced actions on the cohomol-
ogyσ∗=τ∗=θagree, because the real forms σandτare inner to each other.
Remark 4.5.The involution σhowever suggests a solution for modelling the even Hitchin s ystem
inside the equivariant cohomology of the last family of comi nuscule ﬂag varieties with non-zero
signature. Namely, we can consider the anti-holomorphic ac tion ofσon Gr2k(C2n+1)with ﬁxed
point set Gr 2k(C2n+1)σ∼=Gr2k(R2n+1). Then it appears that we have σinducing

↑ ↑/parenleftig
H2∗
SL2n+1/parenrightig
θ∼= H2∗
SO2n+1. (4.12)
The subtlety of this case is that Gr 2k(R2n+1)is no longer simply connected, thus the usual compu-
tation of its equivariant cohomology ( 4.1) does not apply. One can proceed by ﬁrst determining
the equivariant cohomology ring of its universal double cov er - the oriented Grassmannian - from
(4.1), and then take invariants of the cover map. In fact, recentl y the equivariant cohomology of
Gr2k(R2n+1)was computed in [ 15, Theorem 5.23], and the result matches the coinvariant alge bra
H2∗
SL2n+1(Gr2k(C2n+1),C)θ. We note that in this example the group SO2n+1is the Langlands dual
of the Nadler group Spnof our quasi-split real form SU(n,n+ 1) of Hodge type. In particular,
their classifying spaces have isomorphic cohomology
H∗
SO2n+1∼=C[tSO2n+1]WSO2n+1∼=C[tSpn]WSpn∼=H∗
Spn, (4.13)
because WSO2n+1∼=WSpn,tSO2n+1∼=t∗
Spnand the two representations in ( 4.13) can be identiﬁed
by the Killing form.
Remark 4.6.The ﬁnal example of symmetric pairs from Remark 4.2we have not discussed yet is
(SO4n,SO4n−1). In this case τwill induce on the cohomology of our cominuscule ﬂag variety an
involution
θτ:=τ∗:H∗
SO4n(SO4n/SO2×SO4n−2;C)→H∗
SO4n(SO4n/SO2×SO4n−2;C),
which is different from the usual Hodge type (−1)degunlike in the previous cases ( 4.10). In fact
we expect that this θτwill be the involution corresponding to the (only) quasi-sp lit real form
SO(2n+1,2n−1)which is not split or of Hodge type. Thus we expect that the spe ctrum of the
diagram we get from Lemma 4.1

SO4n−1(4.14)
models the Hitchin map on a cominuscule upward ﬂow in the SO(2n+1,2n−1)-Higgs moduli
space.
Remark 4.7.Oscar Garc´ ıa-Prada has pointed out to us that the symmetric pairs in Remark 4.2
precisely correspond to the complexiﬁcations of the maxima l split subgroups of the non-split
quasi-split real forms in [ 8, Table 1. p. 2914]. They are used [ 8, Theorem 6.13.(1)] to construct the
Hitchin-Kostant-Rallis section in the quasi-split real fo rm cases. This demystiﬁes their appear-
ance in our descriptions of the Hitchin maps on cominuscule u pward ﬂows in the quasi-split
Higgs moduli spaces in the diagrams ( 4.6), (4.8), (4.9),(4.12) and ( 4.14) above.20
