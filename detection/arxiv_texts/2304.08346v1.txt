arXiv:2304.08346v1  [math.DG]  17 Apr 2023A RIGIDITY RESULT FOR MINIMAL ROTATION
HYPERSURFACES OF 5D SPACES OF CONSTANT
CURVATURE
AARON J. TYRRELL
Abstract. In this paper we show that a particular extrinsic pointwise h yper-
surface invariant is always non-positive on minimal hypers urfaces of constant
curvature spaces and vanishes identically if and only if the hypersurface is ro-
tational. We show this for hypersurfaces of 5-dimensional s paces of constant
curvature but we conjecture that this should generalize to a similar result in
other dimensions.
1.introduction
LetM5(c) be a simply connected, complete Riemannian manifold with constant
curvature c,wherecis a real number. Do Carmo and Dajczer [1] studied rotational
hypersurfaces of such manifolds and a consequence of Corollary 4 .4 of their work is
that a non-totally geodesic minimal hypersurface of M5(c) is rotational if and only
if it has exactly 3 principal curvatures which are equivalent. Some ot her work on
rotational hypersurfaces can be found here [3], [2].
2.Statement and proof of result

with
S(N)≡0
if and only if Nis a rotational hypersurface.
Remark 2.2.This gives another way to view minimal rotation hypersurfaces of
M5(c).This is as minimizers amongst minimal hypersurfaces of the energy

We can apply Lagrange multipliers to s(x,y,z,w) subject to the constraint x+y+
z+w= 0 to get the system:
4x3−28
12||x||2x=λ (2.4)
4y3−28
12||x||2y=λ (2.5)
4z3−28
12||x||2z=λ (2.6)
4w3−28
12||x||2w=λ (2.7)
x+y+z+w= 0, (2.8)
where||x||2:=x2+y2+z2+w2.We also deﬁne x1:=x,x2:=y,x3:=z,x4:=w.
By the symmetry of these equations we see that the set of points s atisfying these
equations simultaneously is preserved under reﬂections through t he hyperplanes
{xi=xj:i/ne}ationslash=j}. A natural approach is to set x=y=zand try to solve. This

By the scale invariance of (2 .4)−(2.8) we can let λ= 24α3whereα∈Rand we
get critical points
α(−1,−1,−1,3)∀α∈R.
Observe
s(α(−1,−1,−1,3)) = 0.
Clearly we could have chosen any one of x,y,z,w to not be equal to the others,
and therefore we get a critical point at ασ(−1,−1,−1,3) for any α∈Randσ∈S4
whereS4isthesymmetricgroupon4letters. Nowtoseethat0isthelargestc ritical
value, ﬁrst considerthat at a critical point ( x,y,z,w) subject to ourconstraint with
x,y,zdistinct, (2 .4) and (2 .5) are equal so we must have
(2.9) 4 x3−28
12||x||2x= 4y3−28
12||x||2y,
therefore
4(x3−y3) =28
12||x||2(x−y). (2.10)
Factoring the left hand-side of (2 .10) gives
4(x−y)(x2+xy+y2) =28
12||x||2(x−y),ROTATIONAL RIGIDITY 3
recallx/ne}ationslash=yso
(2.11) ( x2+xy+y2) =7
12(x2+y2+z2+w2).
The right hand-side of (2 .11) is independent of the choice of equations we chose to
set equal in (2 .9) and since x/ne}ationslash=zwe get
x2+xy+y2=x2+xz+z2
this implies
x(y−z)+(y−z)(y+z) = 0,
and therefore
(y−z)(x+y+z) = 0
thus, since y/ne}ationslash=zwe get
(2.12) w= 0.
This implies that λ= 0,now if any two of x,y,zis non-zero then it follows that
they diﬀer by a sign. To see this take (2 .4) and see that
(2.13) 4 x2=28
12||x||2,
since the right hand-side of (2 .13) is independent of which of (2 .4), (2.5),(2.6) and
(2.7) we chose we get that x2
i=x2
jifxi/ne}ationslash= 0 and xj/ne}ationslash= 0.The only possibility is
that two of x,y,zare additive inverses and the other is 0 .WLOG assume x=−y
then
s(x,−x,0,0) = 2x4−7
3x4(2.14)
=−1
3x4.
Therefore any constrained critical point with 3 distinct coordinate s is not a global
maximum (we only considered the case where x,yandzare distinct but by sym-
metry this covers every case where three of the coordinates are distinct).
We are left to consider points of the form σ(x,y,x,y) forσ∈S4. Now by (2 .8)
we must have x=−ywhich implies the point has the form ( x,−x,x,−x).Clearly
then
s(x,−x,x,−x) = 4x4−28
3x4
=−26
3x4
we see that these cannot be global maximums either.
Now to be sure that 0 is the global maximum value of s(x,y,z,−x−y−z),
consider the following
(2.15) s(t(x,y,z,w)) =t4s(x,y,z,w).
Therefore to prove that 0 is the global maximum value it is enough to p rove that
0 is the maximum on a neighborhood of the origin. We will consider the clo sed
unit ball in R4intersected with our constraint hyperplane: x+y+z+w= 0.By
homogeneity, if there is point p∈ {(x,y,z,w) :x+y+z+w= 0}such that s(p)>0
thenswill have to achieve its maximum on the boundary of the ball. Assume fo r4 AARON J. TYRRELL
the sake of contradiction that this maximum is achieved at x∈S4∩{(x,y,z,w) :
x+y+z+w= 0}.By homogeneity of the function we get
4s(x) =/summationdisplay
i∂is(x)xi (2.16)
and by Lagrange multipliers we get that there exists λ,µ∈Rsuch that
(2.17) ∂is(x) =λ+2µxi∀i∈ {1,2,3,4}.
Using (2.16) and (2 .17) we can derive
(2.18) 4 s(x) = 2µ.
Suppose that xhas one coordinate which is 0 ,wlog say x= 0.Then
∂xs(x,y,z,w) = 4x3−28
12||x||2x
= 0.
Therefore by (2 .17)
λ= 0.
This implies that (2 .17) can be written as
(2.19) ∂is(x) = 2µxi.
Now ifxhas another coordinate equal to zero then the value of s(x) will be neg-
ative by (2 .14),so suppose y,z,ware non-zero. Now exactly two of the non-zero
coordinates must have the same sign. Assume y≥z >0.
Next consider
∂zs(x,y,z,w) = 4z3−28
12||x||2z
= 4z3−28
12(x2+y2+z2+w2)z
≤4z3−28
12z3−28
12(y2+z2+x2)z
<0.
Therefore by (2 .19)
2µz <0,
this implies that
µ <0
which is a contradiction to (2 .18).We can make a similar argument in the case
where two of y,z,ware negative as follows, suppose 0 > z≥w,then
∂zs(x,y,z,w) = 4z3−28
12||x||2z
= 4z3−28
12(x2+y2+z2+w2)z
≥4z3−28
12z3−28
12(y2+z2+x2)z
>0.
Therefore by (2 .19)
(2.20) 2 µz >0,ROTATIONAL RIGIDITY 5
this implies that
µ <0
which is a contradiction to (2 .18).Therefore xcan only have non-zero coordinates.
Suppose that xhas two positive coordinates and two negative coordinates, wlog
assume that the positive coordinates are xandyand assume wlog x≥yand that
the negative coordinates are z,wwithz≥w.Then
∂ys(x,y,z,w) = 4y3−28
12||x||2y
= 4y3−28
12(x2+y2+z2+w2)y
≤4y3−28
12y3−28
12(y2+z2+w2)y
<0.
Therefore
λ+2µy <0,
this implies that
λ <0.
Next consider
∂zs(x,y,z,w) = 4z3−28
12||x||2z
= 4z3−28
12(x2+y2+z2+w2)z
≥4z3−28
12z3−28
12(y2+z2+x2)z
>0.
Therefore
λ+2µz >0,
this implies that
λ >0.
Therefore we have reached a contradiction and hence xcannot have two positive
coordinates and two negative coordinates.
Now we know that xmust have 3 coordinates of the same sign and the 4 thmust
be of the opposite. Suppose x≥y≥z >0 andw=−x−y−z.Then
(2.21) ∂xs(x) = 4x3−7
3x=λ+2µx
which implies
(2.22) 4 x3−7
3x−2µx=λ
the right hand-side of (2 .22) is independent of which variable we chose in (2 .21) so
we get
(2.23) 4 x3
i−7
3xi−2µxi= 4x3
j−7
3xj−2µxj.
It follows that
(2.24) 4( x3
i−x3
j)−(7
3+2µ)(xi−xj) = 06 AARON J. TYRRELL
now ifxi/ne}ationslash=xjthen dividing by xi−xjgives
(2.25) 4( x2
i+xixj+x2
j)−(7
3+2µ) = 0
therefore
(2.26) 4( x2
i+xixj+x2
j) = (7
3+2µ)
now since the right hand-side is independent of the choice of coordin ates we get
that ifx,yandzare distinct then
4(x2+xy+y2) =7
3+2µ (2.27)
4(x2+xw+w2) =7
3+2µ (2.28)
writingw=−x−y−zand taking the average of (2 .27) and (2 .28) gives
2(x2−xz+w2+y2) =7
3+2µ.
We could have swapped the roles of xandzand gotten
2(z2−xz+w2+y2) =7
3+2µ.
Which implies
x=z.
Therefore x,yandzcannot be distinct.
Now suppose two of the coordinates are equal, wlog x=z,then ify/ne}ationslash=xwe get
the following equations
4(y2+yz+z2) =7
3+2µ (2.29)
4(z2+zw+w2) =7
3+2µ (2.30)
4(y2+yw+w2) =7
3+2µ (2.31)
Writingw=−x−y−zand taking the average of equations (2 .29) and (2 .30) gives
2(y2−zx+w2+z2) =7
3+2µ.
Taking the average of (2 .29) and (2 .31) gives
2(y2−yx+z2+w2) =7
3+2µ.
This implies that y=z.
Therefore xis of the form ασ(1,1,1,−3) forα∈R+andσ∈S4and we get
s(x) = 0,
which is a contradiction. If x,yandzwere negative instead of positive then we
would still get a contradiction since the point −xwould also be a local maximum
on which shas the same value by symmetry but by what we’ve just argued we
would get s(x) = 0.Now by corollary 4 .4 of [1] we get the result. ⊠ROTATIONAL RIGIDITY 7
