Abstract
Molecular magnets have received signiﬁcant attention because of their potential applications in quantum
information and quantum computing. A delicate balance of electron correlation, spin-orbit coupling (SOC),
ligand ﬁeld splitting, and other effects produces a persistent magnetic moment within each molecular mag-
net unit. The discovery and design of molecular magnets with improved functionalities would be greatly
aided by accurate computations. However, the competition among the different effects poses a challenge
for theoretical treatments. Electron correlation plays a central role, since d-, or f-element ions, which pro-
vide the magnetic states in molecular magnets, often require explicit many-body treatments. SOC, which
expands the dimensionality of the Hilbert space, can also lead to non-perturbative effects in the presence
of strong interaction. Furthermore, molecular magnets are large, with tens of atoms in even the smallest
systems. We show how an ab initio treatment of molecular magnets can be achieved with auxiliary-ﬁeld
quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC), in which electron correlation, SOC, and material speciﬁcity are included
accurately and on an equal footing. The approach is demonstrated by an application to compute the zero-
ﬁeld splitting of a locally-linear Co2+complex.

Molecular magnets were ﬁrst experimentally realized 30 years ago with the magnetic charac-
terization of a Mn 12cluster which showed magnetic relaxation times on the order of two months
at a temperature of 2K [1]. Since then, broad classes of possible applications for molecular
magnet systems have been explored in areas such as high-density classical memory, quantum in-
formation [2–7], and chemical catalysis [8], among others. For example, the TbPc 2molecule has
been used to implement Grover’s algorithm within a single molecule [5]. Since the original Mn 12
cluster, many molecular magnets (often referred to as single-molecule magnets in the literature)
have been discovered and designed, based on 3d transition-metal [9–16], lanthanide [17–20], and
even actinide ions [21–24]. While most molecular magnets display magnetic hysteresis only at
temperatures below a few Kelvin, a dysprosium metallocene cation was recently discovered to
display magnetic hysteresis at temperatures of up to 80 K [20]. This represents an encouraging
milestone for practical applications of molecular magnets in technology, since magnetic behavior
occurs above the temperature of liquid nitrogen. There is signiﬁcant interest in the design of new
molecular magnets both for speciﬁc technological applications and fundamental science.
The deﬁning characteristic of molecular magnets is the magnetic bistability that occurs due to
their electronic structure. The ground state of molecular magnets must be 2-fold degenerate, at
least approximately, with non-zero total angular momentum, along with an energetic barrier that
blocks spontaneous reversal of the magnetic moment. The energetic barrier is provided by the zero
ﬁeld splitting (ZFS) that arises due to a combination of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and symmetry
breaking from the ligand ﬁeld. In the literature, ZFS is often used to refer to the parameters of the
phenomenological pseudospin Hamiltonian used to model the effect; in the present work, however,
we take ZFS to refer to the energy gaps in the low energy many-body spectrum of the ab initio
Hamiltonian. Several relevant magnetic relaxation pathways exist for molecular magnets with
phonon-mediated processes (Orbach, Raman, and direct electron-phonon scattering) and quantum
tunneling of the magnetization most often being the limiting factor in operating temperature. Of
course, a complete theoretical investigation of molecular magnets must consider these effects.
Much progress has been made in regards to designing efﬁcient molecular magnets in terms of
overall strategy for producing efﬁcient molecular magnets based on the choice of magnetic ion,
usually a 3 d-transition metal or lanthanide, and ligand [25–28]. Accurate and reliable ab initio
treatments of molecular magnets would greatly facilitate designing molecular magnets and tuning
2their properties for speciﬁc use.
Molecular magnets pose challenges to explicit many-body treatments due to the very large di-
mension of the Hilbert space necessary to describe them. While exact solutions to the quantum
many-electron problem are possible for small systems, the cost of exact methods scale exponen-
tially in system size, which renders direct applications to typical molecular magnets not possible.
Approximate solutions based on density functional theory (DFT) are a natural choice; however,
DFT may be inadequate due to the correlated d-, or f-element ions at the core of molecular mag-
nets. In general, Explicit many-body methods will most likely be needed for molecular magnets.
The quantum chemistry “gold standard” method, coupled cluster singles doubles with perturbative
triples ( CCSD(T) ), scales as N7versus system size, N, making applications to typical molecular
magnets challenging. Additionally, while CCSD(T) reliably achieves chemical accuracy for main
group chemistry, this is not always the case for 3d-transition metal chemistry [29, 30].
The typical challenges of performing many-body calculations are exacerbated by the inclusion
of SOC which is fundamental to the computation of the ZFS. The presence of spin-ﬂip terms
in the Hamiltonian expands the dimension of the Hilbert space that must be considered, greatly
increasing the high computational cost of explicit many-body methods. In much of the molecular
magnet literature, the ZFS gaps and/or pseudospin Hamiltonian parameters are computed in two
stages. First, static correlation is accounted for using a non-relativistic or scalar relativistic state-
averaged CASSCF (SA-CASSCF) [31, 32] calculation performed in an active space consisting of
the magnetically active d-, or f-manifold. Occasionally, a slightly larger active space is used which
includes a few orbitals and electrons from the ligand as well. In the SA-CASSCF calculations,
care is taken to average over the proper “no SOC” states since the speciﬁc states which are chosen
for state averaging may inﬂuence the results. Dynamic correlation is sometimes approximately
accounted for using many-body perturbation theory, usually with 2nd-order N-electron valance
perturbation theory (NEVPT2) [33, 34] or 2nd-order complete active space perturbation theory
(CASPT2) [35–37]. SOC is then treated in a second stage via either quasi-degenerate perturbation
theory (QDPT) [38], or the restricted active space state interaction (RASSI) method [39]. Such
two stage approaches to the calculation of the ZFS have been remarkably successful for many
3d-transition metal, and lanthanide complexes.
In this work, we develop a general approach to treat molecular magnets using auxiliary-ﬁeld
quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) [40, 41]. We recently incorporated explicit SOC in ab initio
AFQMC calculations which provides a computational framework where material speciﬁcity, both
3static and dynamic correlations, and SOC are treated accurately and on an equal footing [42].
AFQMC has demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in correlated electron systems in general,
and systems containing 3d-transition metals speciﬁcally, as determined by several recent bench-
marks [43–46], which, as discussed above, is an important factor for molecular magnets. The cal-
culation of the ZFS in molecular magnets can be performed as a one-shot many-body calculation
with no need to perform state-averaging, or to diagonalize the SOC operator in an explicit basis of
many-body states. AFQMC has a low order polynomial scaling versus system size (similar to DFT
but with a large prefactor), making applications to large systems feasible, even with the inclusion
of SOC. Still, the very large Hilbert space dimension of typical molecular magnets makes such
applications very computationally demanding. As an additional ingredient, we introduce local
embedding [47], which produces an effective Hamiltonian in a basis of local orthonormal orbitals
chosen based on local criteria, to focus computational effort on magnetic ions while including
much of the ligand as well. The resulting Hamiltonian operates on a signiﬁcantly reduced Hilbert
space, which greatly increases the effective system size that can be treated. The accuracy of local
embedding AFQMC can be systematically improved towards full AFQMC treatment of the entire
system by increasing the size of the local basis used.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we provide a brief summary of
the general AFQMC framework, before describing our approach for the non-perturbative treatment
of molecular magnet systems using AFQMC. In Section III, we demonstrate the approach by ap-
plying it to compute the low-energy many-body spectrum, and ZFS, of the Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2
molecule. Comparisons are made with experimental results and other ab initio many-body results
from the literature [48]. We conclude with some general remarks in Section IV. In the supplemen-
tal material, we provide a Python script which reproduces the Hamiltonian used in Section III.
II. THEORY
In this Section, we describe the treatment of molecular magnets using AFQMC including ex-
plicit, non-perturbative SOC. We focus speciﬁcally on the calculation of the low-energy many-
body spectrum, and ZFS gaps. In ab initio AFQMC calculations, the many-body Hamiltonian
is expressed in the second quantization formalism using a ﬁnite basis of orthonormal orbitals as
may be obtained from self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF) calculations. A key component of performing
efﬁcient AFQMC calculations in molecular magnets is the production of an effective Hamiltonian
4which simpliﬁes the rather complicated Hilbert space of the full system. In Subsection II B, we
describe a workﬂow for the non-perturbative treatment of molecular magnets, at the AFQMC level
of theory, including a procedure to produce an interacting second quantized Hamiltonian.
A. Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC)
Here, we provide an overview of AFQMC [40, 41]. A recent review outlines the general for-
malism in detail [49], with a number of technical issues further discussed in Ref. [50]. AFQMC
is an orbitally-based many-body method and is formulated in terms of a generic, interacting 2nd
quantized Hamiltonian,
ˆH=ˆK+ˆV=å
mnKmnˆc†
mˆcn+å
mngdVmngd ˆc†
mˆc†
nˆcdˆcg;(1)
where ˆKincludes all one-body Hamiltonian terms, ˆVincludes all two-body interaction terms, ˆ c†
m
and ˆcmare the fermionic creation and annihilation operators, respectively, which create/annihilate
electrons in a chosen orthonormal basis of single-electron orbitals, and Kmn,Vmngd are the matrix
of elements of ˆK,ˆVrepresented in the orbital basis. Any standard form of the many-electron
Hamiltonian can be represented by Eq. 1 including all-electron or pseudopotential Hamiltonians,
and relativistic or non-relativistic treatments.
Observables are directly computed using a stochastic representation of many-body states in
order to achieve high accuracy at a cost that scales as a low order polynomial. The stochastic
representation of a many-body wavefunction, jYi, is obtained via projection starting from an initial
wavefunction,jYIi, which has nonzero overlap with the target wavefunction. The projection is
performed in imaginary time as
lim
b!¥e bˆHjYIi=e tˆHe tˆHe tˆHjYIi!jYi; (2)
where the total projection time, b, has been divided into small imaginary time steps, t.
By Thoulesses’ Theorem [51], the operation of the exponential of a one-body operator on a
Slater determinant simply produces another Slater determinant; however, the presence of two-body
Hamiltonian terms makes the projection nontrivial. To handle general interactions, the projector,
e tˆH, is cast as a high-dimensional integral as follows. First, the electron-electron interaction term
is factored into a quadratic form of one-body operators,
ˆV=å
gˆv2
g; (3)
5where ˆ vgare one-body operators which are usually obtained from a modiﬁed Cholesky decompo-
sition [52]. The set of ˆ vgare truncated based on a small cutoff threshold, dChol:, which introduces
a systematically improvable approximation. Second, a Trotter-Suzuki [53, 54] decomposition is
performed,
e tˆHe tˆK=2e tågˆv2ge tˆK=2+O 
t3
; (4)
followed by a Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation [55, 56] of e tågˆv2g. The projector is then
given by,
e tˆHZ
dP()B()+O 
t3
; (5)
whereis a vector containing auxiliary-ﬁelds, P()is a normal distribution function, and B()
is given by
B() =e tˆK=2eptˆve tˆK=2; (6)
where ˆvis the vector of one-body operators deﬁned implicitly by Eq. 3. Since B()is simply
a product of exponentials of one-body operators, it can be easily applied to Slater determinants
and the integral is evaluated by sampling auxiliary-ﬁelds from P()at each imaginary time step.
Many-body states are represented in an over-complete basis of non-orthogonal Slater determinant
random walkers as
jYi:=å
kjFki; (7)
wherejFkiis a single Slater determinant random walker, and kruns over all walkers. Thus, the
projection has been cast as a random walk in nonorthogonal Slater determinant space.
The sign/phase problem, which is a generic problem that effects all fermionic quantum Monte
Carlo approaches, is controlled by the phaseless approximation in ab initio AFQMC calcula-
tions [40]. The phase problem arises from the fact that physical observables are invariant under
an arbitrary complex phase of the wavefunction from which they are computed. As the random
walk progresses, walkers accumulate a random phase relative to each other due to the, generally,
complex-valued projector. An importance sampling transformation based on the overlap of indi-
vidual walkers with a trial wavefunction, jYTi, is used to cast the random walks in a ﬁxed gauge
choice, which provides the theoretical basis to control this problem [57]. The trial wavefunction
6is an approximation to the target many-body state, and must have non-zero overlap with the de-
sired exact many-body state. With importance sampling, the Monte Carlo representation of the
many-body wavefunction becomes,
jYi:=å
kwkjFki; (8)
where wkis a weight which is accumulated over the course of the random walk based on a chosen
importance function, I, at projection step nasw(n)
k=I(;F(n 1)
k)w(n 1)
k. Random walkers are still
free to diffuse across the entire complex plane deﬁned by hYTjFki, allowing a ﬁnite density of
walkers to accumulate at the origin, causing walker weights to diverge as the walk progresses. The
phase problem is then eliminated by projecting each individual walker onto an evolving line in the
complex plane. This is achieved by multiplying each walker by max f0;cos(Dq)g, where Dqis the
phase ofhYTjFki=hYTjFk 1i. The phaseless approach introduces a bias which can be controlled
by the quality of the trial wavefunction.
The most straight-forward application of AFQMC is the computation of the ground state en-
ergy. Excited state AFQMC calculations are possible if a suitable trial wavefunction is used [58].
This typically requires a multideterminant trial wavefunction as may be obtained from CASSCF
or other approaches. Other more advanced projection methods are possible [59] but we will limit
ourselves to the more conventional approach with multi-determinants.
SOC can be treated explicitly in ab initio AFQMC calculations [42] since the SOC term, ˆKsoc
ˆWsocˆS, is of a general one-body form as in generalized Hartree-Fock. Several choices of ˆWsoc
are possible ranging from all-electron relativistic Hamiltonians to formally non-relativistic model
Hamiltonians based on relativistic pseudopotentials (PSPs) or effective core potentials (ECPs).
Explicitly, the 2nd-quantized Hamiltonian with SOC in a spin-orbital basis is given by
ˆHsoc=å
mn
Kmn+Ksoc
mn
ˆc†
mˆcn+å
mngdVmngd ˆc†

where Ksoc
mn= [WzSz+W+S++W S ]mn. The greek indices, m,n,g,dcorrespond to spin-
orbitals of the form cm=(i;s)=fi(~r)jsi, where fi(~r)are spatial orbitals, and jsiare eigenstates of
the single-particle ˆ szoperator.
The AFQMC procedure is formally unchanged by the inclusion of explicit SOC; however, a
few practical adaptations must be made. With no SOC, the HS propagator, B(s), of Eq 6 can be
factorized
B(s) =B"(s)
B#(s); (10)
7where B"(s)(B#(s)) operates only on the up (down) spin sector, and Slater determinant random
walkers are given as

With SOC, the HS projector explicitly mixes spins and has the form

where the spin-ﬂip propagators B+= () =Exp[ tˆW+= ]are Hermitian conjugates of each other,

SOC term. Generalized Slater determinant random walkers

are used during the AFQMC projection. Thus, SOC is included exactly and on an equal footing
with electron correlation. The effective system size is doubled compared with treatments that
neglect SOC.
B. Treatment of molecular magnets
In this subsection, we describe the treatment of molecular magnets at the many-body level of
theory, including explicit SOC, electron correlation, and ligand ﬁeld effects. The basic idea is
to produce a 2nd quantized Hamiltonian from which the low energy spectrum may be computed
using AFQMC either with or without SOC. Figure 1 includes a schematic representation of the
high-level workﬂow. In the remainder of this section, we describe each step in the workﬂow using
the schematic as a guide.
Our procedure begins with an initial Hartree-Fock or DFT calculation, as indicated in the light
green box of Fig. 1. This is performed in order to generate an orbital basis, and an electron
density, for subsequent local embedding (DFT +Utype calculations can also be used). This can
be accomplished with calculations that neglect SOC since typical ligands for molecular magnets
consist of light atoms, or atoms which are closed-shell. For ligands containing heavy elements,
such as Br, I, or Bi [60, 61], it will be useful to include SOC from the outset. Here, we used
spin restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) DFT which provides a convenient starting point

for local embedding. However, spin unrestricted Kohn-Sham (UKS) or generalized Kohn-Sham
(GKS) DFT could be used instead, if desired.
The next step, corresponding to the purple box in Figure 1, is to construct an effective Hamilto-
nian for the molecular magnet system. We require a Hamiltonian which captures material-speciﬁc
ligand ﬁeld effects, SOC, and electron correlation. This is achieved in two steps, as indicated by
the dotted breakout section of Fig. 1. First, local embedding is employed, as described below, to
build an effective Hamiltonian describing the magnetically active ion(s) in the molecular magnet
and which accounts for ligand ﬁeld effects. Second, a SOC operator, which operates on the same
Hilbert space as the effective Hamiltonian, is constructed and added to the effective Hamiltonian.
We describe both of these steps below. Of course, one can perform calculations with no SOC by
simply neglecting the second step.
We outline the local embedding approach we use in AFQMC [47, 62]. The crux of local
embedding is a separability approximation of the many-body wavefunction, jYi, into an active
and an inactive part,
jYiA(jYIi
jYAi); (14)
wherejYIiis a wavefunction in the inactive space, jYAiis the active space many-body wavefunc-
9tion, and Ais an antisymmetrizer. The choice of AandIcan lead to different forms of embedding,
and here they are chosen based on local criteria. This approximation allows the energy of the full
Hamiltonian to be mapped onto an effective embedding Hamiltonian:
hYjˆHjYi=hYAjˆHAjYAi; (15)
where ˆHAis the embedding Hamiltonian which operates only in Asimilar to the standard frozen
core approximation. This condition leads to the following explicit form of the embedding Hamil-
tonian,

where the ﬁrst two terms are the one-, and two-body terms in the full Hamiltonian restricted to
orbitals within A,EIis a constant contribution from the energy of the inactive part, and ˆVI A=

i jˆc†
iˆcjis a one-body operator which captures the interaction between active and inactive
electrons. Formally, ˆVI Ais an energy consistent, non-local pseudopotential which is computed
for the speciﬁc system at hand, avoiding transferability errors. The combination of ˆK, restricted
toA, and ˆVI Adescribe the symmetry of the full ligand. Therefore, a small active space focused
tightly on a magnetic ion is directly inﬂuenced by the ligand ﬁeld at the many-body level of theory.
The partition between AandIis deﬁned in terms of a chosen set of active/inactive local orbitals.
Orbitals are assigned to the active space if their centroid is localized within a chosen localization
radius of the strongly-correlated center(s), and a separate localization radius is used for occupied
orbitals, Ro, and for virtual orbitals, Rv. The accuracy of the approximation can be dialed up by
increasing RoandRvand it was previously shown that, for ﬁxed Ro, the absolute AFQMC energy
converges in RvatRv=Ro+Cwith Cbeing a system-dependent constant typically ranging from
2-6 Bohr [47]. However, relative energies, such as the zero-ﬁeld splitting (ZFS), converge more
rapidly, allowing for smaller choices of C. In initial test cases, local embedding was observed
to reduce the computational cost of some calculations by orders of magnitude compared with
AFQMC performed on the full Hilbert space.
For the computation of the ZFS gaps, AFQMC calculations are performed with an explicit SOC
operator included in the Hamiltonian. An explicit spin-orbital basis, fjcmig, is constructed from
the set of active local orbitals corresponding to A. The second quantized SOC operator can be
constructed directly in the spin-orbital basis as
ˆKsoc
mn=hcmjˆWsocˆSjcni; (17)
10which is added to ˆHA(also transformed to the spin-orbital basis). Several choices of ab initio SOC
operators are available in the literature, including all-electron and PSP formalisms. In the case of
all-electron relativistic Hamiltonians, the Breit interaction, which is a spin-dependent two-body
interaction, is often modeled by an approximate one-body operator. This is often done via the spin-
orbit mean-ﬁeld (SOMF) approximation [63], in which the full Breit interaction is replaced with a
Fock-like operator constructed from a given electron density, although other approximations exist
as well [64]. A detailed discussion of the accuracy of such effective one-body approximations
to the Breit interaction is beyond the scope of the present work, but there are indications from
perturbative treatments of molecular magnets [65] that such approximations provide a reasonable
description. In the case of PSP formalisms, contributions from the Breit interaction are implicitly
accounted for, again as an effective one-body contribution, if the PSP is ﬁt using reference data
which accounts for the Breit interaction, as is quite common for fully relativistic PSPs. Equation 17
is consistent with any effective one-body treatment of SOC, but we adopt the use of relativistic
PSPs which have demonstrated a high degree of accuracy compared with experiment and which
also have the advantage of allowing SOC to be included selectively for atoms where SOC effects
are expected to be most import - i.e. for heavy and/or magnetically active ions.
The next step in the workﬂow, indicated by the light gray box in Figure 1, is to compute trial
wavefunctions for AFQMC. The embedding Hamiltonian (Eq. 16) is used for this purpose. (In
Sec. III we perform calculations both with and without SOC. The trial wave function is generated
with or without SOC, consistently with the target AFQMC calculation.) For general excited state
calculations, such as the ZFS, targeting the correct quantum numbers and symmetry is as impor-
tant as the the accuracy (as judged by the variational energy, for example). Many approaches can
be used to compute the trial wave function [50]. In the present work, we used truncated multi-
determinant expansions computed using semistochastic heatbath CI (SHCI) [66–68], including
explicit SOC where needed. We used a small active space for SHCI which focuses on the mag-
netically active electrons. We note that SHCI can treat much larger active spaces than those used
here, but that is not needed for the present purpose since the AFQMC results converge quickly
with respect to the truncated trial wave function.
In molecular magnets, the z-projection of the total angular momentum, ˆJz, is often an approxi-
mately good quantum number. While it is possible to construct rigorous many-body eigenstates of
theˆJzoperator for a particular system, these may not correspond to approximate eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian in general and, therefore, may perform poorly as trial wavefunctions for AFQMC. Al-
11ternatively, one may utilize a complete set of ˆJzeigenstates ,fjFMJ
iig, where MJis the eigenvalue
corresponding to ˆJzandiis an index within the MJmanifold, as a basis in which to characterize
the approximate ˆJzquantum number label via projection. An arbitrary many-body wavefunction,
jYi, may be expressed as
jYi=J
å
MJ= Jå
i2MJCMJ
ijFMJ
ii; (18)
where CMJ
i=hFMJ
ijYi. The total weight of jYiwhich resides within a particular MJ-manifold is
given by
WMJ=å
i2MJjCMJ
ij2: (19)
Approximate MJlabels are then assigned based on the weights as determined by Eq. 19, but only
if such an assignment can be made unambiguously.
Our procedure to assign quantum numbers to each trial wavefunction, when possible, is as
follows. While the dimension of a complete set of ˆJzeigenstates is exponentially large, the angular
momentum is determined by only a handful of d-, or f-electrons in practice. Diagonalizing ˆJzonly
within the corresponding manifold(s) provides meaningful MJlabels while limiting the dimension
of the basis of MJstates to a routinely manageable size. In this case, the equality in Eq. 18
no longer holds and the accuracy of the approximation can be measured by comparing the total
weight of the original wavefunction to that of the MJ-decomposed wavefunction. In the present
work, all SHCI wavefunctions retained an average total weight of 0.9998(1) after being projected
into the MJbasis. In the absence of SOC, a similar procedure can be used to assign MLlabels
by diagonalizing ˆLzinstead of ˆJz. We emphasize that the trial wavefunctions used in AFQMC
calculations are truncated SHCI wavefunctions, which retain only O(50)determinants; no attempt
was made to force particular quantum numbers in the truncated trial wave function.
In the ﬁnal step, AFQMC calculations of the ground state and low-lying excited states are
performed using the local embedding Hamiltonian either with (without) SOC, and selecting trial
wavefunctions based on their approximate MJ(ML) value. The approach can be applied to any
molecular magnet system including those with several magnetic centers (with only minor mod-
iﬁcations). Thus, the AFQMC method provides a general framework for the non-perturbative
simulation of molecular magnets. We demonstrate this framework in Sec. III below.
12III. APPLICATION TO A LINEAR CO2+COMPLEX
The Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2molecule was recently synthesized and experimentally character-
ized, displaying magnetic hysteresis at temperatures of up to 5K [48]. It is, to our knowledge, the
current record holder for ZFS gap among single ion molecular magnets based on 3d transition met-
als. The large ZFS gap is due to unquenched orbital angular momentum in the ground state, which
is unusual for 3 d-element complexes. The Co2+ion at the core of the Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2
molecule has similar electronic structure to a Co2+ion adsorbed on the surface of MgO [69],
which also displays unquenched orbital angular momentum in the ground state.
The weak S6ligand ﬁeld and the locally-linear coordination environment of the Co2+ion at
the center of the Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2molecule lead to a C¥vpseduosymmetry which provides
approximate symmetry labels each corresponding to a well deﬁned eigenvalue of ˆLz. Neglecting
SOC, a Co2+ion in vacuum has a4F ground state. Under a C¥vligand ﬁeld, the4F state is split
into4S,4P,4D, and4Fwhere each level is two-fold degenerate in orbital degrees of freedom
except for4S, which is non-degenerate. Even a modestly strong C¥vﬁeld would typically lead
to a4Sground state; however, the weak ligand ﬁeld in Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2leads to a4F
ground state instead. If SOC is included, ˆLzno longer provides a good quantum number and the
4Fstate is split into eigenstates of ˆJz, which range from MJ=9=2 to MJ=3=2. The ground
state of Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2hasMJ=9=2 as determined by DC magnetic susceptibility data
from the literature, and the ﬁrst excitation ZFS gap of 450 cm 1is attributed to an excitation to
theMJ=7=2 level. Since Co2+is a Kramer’s ion, Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2has exact two-fold
degeneracy regardless of the ligand ﬁeld symmetry. In our discussions below, C¥vandMJlabels
are only approximate and are determined as described in Sec. II B.
We apply the general computational framework described in Sec. II B to compute the low-
energy spectrum of Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2, both with and without SOC. ZFS gaps are taken di-
rectly from the low energy spectrum computed with SOC. The Co ion is treated with the CRENBL
PSP (which is based on fully relativistic reference data), using the corresponding uncontracted
Gaussian primitive basis [70]. All other atoms are treated with the non-relativistic all-electron
Hamiltonian using the standard cc-pVDZ basis for C, O, and Si and the STO-6G basis for H. We
veriﬁed that the cc-pVDZ basis for ligand atoms is adequate for the calculations performed here.
The experimentally observed geometry of the Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2molecule [48] is shown

without imposing point-group symmetry. To assist in converging the initial DFT calculations, we
replaced each of the six naphthol (“Naph” = C10H7) units with a hydrogen termination using an O-
H bondlength of 1.04 Å and maintaining the original Si-O-C bond angle; the simpliﬁed geometry,
Co(C(SiMe 2OH) 3)2, is illustrated in panel b) of Fig. 2. No further geometry optimization was
performed on Co(C(SiMe 2OH) 3)2. Results in the literature showed that the ZFS computed for
Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2and the ZFS computed for a model in which napthol units were replaced
by a methyl group were essentially identical level-by-level, with a maximum deviation of 14 cm 1
but with most levels agreeing to within 3 cm 1[48]. This suggests that the ZFS is not sensitive
to the details of the ligand for this particular complex, which is unsurprising given the very weak
ligand ﬁeld strength.
Initial DFT calculations were performed using the PBE0 functional and including only the
scalar relativistic part of the Co PSP with no SOC. A local embedding Hamiltonian was con-
structed as described in Sec. II B using the PBE0 solution, Foster-Boys localized [71] restricted
open-shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) orbitals as a basis, and localization radii (Ro;Rv) = ( 2:8;5:4)
14atomic units centered at the Co ion. This choice of localization radii yields an active space which
includes all Co occupied and virtual orbitals, and some ligand orbitals, for a total of 99 spatial or-
bitals, or 198 spin-orbitals. The 3 s, 3pand 3 delectrons belonging to the Co2+ion are all included
in the active space, as well as a total of 4 additional electrons from neighboring C atoms, for a
total of 19 active electrons. We checked that the choice of ( Ro,Rv) is sufﬁcient for the purpose of
computing the ZFS levels in Co(C(SiMe 2OH) 3)2.
We computed trial wavefunctions for AFQMC using SHCI as implemented in the code
“Dice” [66–68]. We performed ROHF on the embedding Hamiltonian with no SOC to provide
a reference determinant for SHCI, and to deﬁne the Co 3 d-orbitals. SHCI calculations, both with
and without SOC, were performed for a small active space consisting of 7 orbitals and 11 elec-
trons, which include both the 3 dorbitals/electrons and some ligand orbitals/electrons; in the SHCI,
a variational cutoff of 1.0E-5 was used. We then truncate the SHCI wavefunction by discarding
determinants with small weights using a truncation threshold of 0.001, to obtain the trial wave
functions for AFQMC. We assigned labels to each trial wavefunction corresponding to ˆJzandˆLz
for calculations performed with SOC and without SOC, respectively, as described in Sec. II B. We
conﬁrmed that AFQMC maintains the same MJ(ML) labels as the trial wavefunctions.
The low energy many-body spectrum of Co(C(SiMe 2OH) 3)2computed from AFQMC is shown
in panel a) of Fig. 3. Results are organized into two columns. The left column, labelled “No
SOC”, is for a Hamiltonian with only the scalar relativistic PSP of Co, without SOC. The AFQMC
ground state from the “No SOC” column is used as an absolute energy reference for all of panel
a). Symmetry labels in the “No SOC” column correspond to approximate C ¥vlabels. The right
column, labelled “SOC”, is for a Hamiltonian which contains both the scalar relativistic and the
SOC parts of the Co PSP. In all panels of Fig. 3, red horizontal lines are AFQMC energy levels,
and boxes indicate the stochastic uncertainties. Besides AFQMC results, we also show the results
of the modest SHCI calculation from which the trial wavefunction was generated, as well as a
SA-CASSCF(5o,7e) + QDPT result from the literature [48], for reference. The experimentally
measured ZFS [48] of 450 cm 1, determined to be from the gap between an MJ=9=2 ground
state and MJ=7=2 ﬁrst excited state, is also included in panel b).
The “No SOC” spectrum in Fig. 3 corresponds to all levels that nominally originate from
the4F ground state of a Co2+ion in vacuum split by a C¥vligand ﬁeld. The ground state
is a4Fstate, with unquenched orbital angular momentum, which would be doubly degener-
ate under perfect C¥vsymmetry; however, the system has only S6symmetry. A small gap of

FIG. 3: AFQMC results for the Co(C(SiMe 2OH) 3)2molecule. Panel a) shows energy levels with (right
column) and without (left column) SOC. Red horizontal lines are AFQMC energies and shaded boxes are
the stochastic uncertainty. Colored boxes in the entire ﬁgure correspond to the approximate C¥vlabels of
“No SOC”. Approximate symmetry labels (see main text) are displayed next to the corresponding AFQMC
energy level. The AFQMC energies are plotted on the same absolute scale using the “No SOC”4Fground
state energy ( 2881:97934 EHa) as a reference. Panel b) contains the ZFS computed with AFQMC, corre-
sponding to the “SOC” column in panel a). For reference, the ZFS computed in the SHCI(7o,11e) calcu-
lations, from which we obtain a truncated trial wavefunction for AFQMC, is also shown, together with the
result from SA-CASSCF(5o,7e) + QDPT [48] (labelled “QDPT* (5o,7e)”). The experimentally observed
ZFS is plotted as a purple horizontal dotted line.
590(178) cm 1exists between the ground state and its approximate4Fpair. Nonrelativistic
state-averaged CASSCF(5o,7e) calculations order the states as4F,4S,4D, then4P[48], simi-
lar to our AFQMC results. The4Dand4Pstates computed with AFQMC are separated by only
217(138) cm 1. The total spread of the splitting of a hypothetical4F state under the ligand ﬁeld in
Co(C(SiMe 2OH) 3)2is 2717(281) cm 1, similar to the estimate of 2768 cm 1obtained from non-
relativistic SA-CASSCF(5o,7e) + NEVPT2 [48]. The relatively small spread reﬂects the weak
ligand ﬁeld strength.
In Fig. 3 the low energy many-body spectrum of Co(C(SiMe 2OH) 3)2, with SOC included,
is shown in the right column of panel a). The AFQMC calculations were run longer for “SOC”
16than for “No SOC” (beyond the expected increase in computational demand due to the doubling
of the Slater determinants), in order to gather more statistics to resolve the small energy scales.
All states which originate from both of the4Fstates in the “No SOC” column are included. All
levels computed with SOC are two-fold degenerate due to time reversal symmetry, and AFQMC
was run for only one of the two states. AFQMC predicts an MJ=9=2 ground state, consistent
with experiment. The effect from SOC is seen to contribute on roughly the same energy scale as
the splittings induced by the ligand ﬁeld.
Panel b) in Fig. 3 shows a zoomed in view of the computed ZFS, with respect to the energy of
the ground state, MJ=9=2. The ZFS computed using SHCI(7o,11e) correspond to the calculations
used to obtain trial wavefunctions for AFQMC and are derived from the variational energy of the
SHCI wavefunctions. For comparison, we inlcuded the ZFS computed using SA-CASSCF(5o,7e)
+ QDPT, as well as experimental values, all taken from Ref. [48]. The experimental result, dis-
played as a purple horizontal dotted line, is from variable-ﬁeld far-infrared spectroscopy, covering
an energy range of 30-600 cm 1, and represents a direct measure of the ZFS. We note that the
energy range explored by experiment does not reach the next gap predicted by either AFQMC or
by SA-CASSCF(5o,7e)+QDPT. The gap between the MJ=9=2 ground state and the MJ=7=2
state computed by AFQMC is 382(74) cm 1, where the error bar is the joint statistical uncertainty
of the two separate calculations. This agrees with the experimentally observed value of 450 cm 1.
SA-CASSCF(5o,7e) + QDPT yields an excitation gap of 468 cm 1, which agrees remarkably well
with experiment. The spectrum computed from AFQMC provides a useful benchmark. It is in-
teresting to note that, in addition to the ﬁrst excitation, SA-CASSCF(5o,7e) + QDPT also yields a
spectrum in good agreement with AFQMC, over-estimating the second excitation slightly.
IV . CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
We have developed a general non-perturbative approach to treat molecular magnets using
AFQMC, in which material speciﬁcity, static and dynamic electron correlation, and SOC are
treated accurately and on an equal footing. As a ﬁrst application, we test the method on a slightly
simpliﬁed model of the Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2molecule. Ab initio AFQMC incorporating SOC
and treating the interaction in a large active space yields a ZFS gap of 382(74) cm 1, between the
MJ=9=2 ground state and the MJ=7=2 excited state, consistent with the experimental value of
450 cm 1. The computed low-lying excitations can serve as a useful benchmark for future work
17in this system and for method developments.
We expect this approach to be applicable to many other related systems for high accuracy, pre-
dictive calculations. A number of methodological improvements can be made to further improve
the computational efﬁciency, in order to treat even larger systems or target higher statistical accura-
cies. The Co(C(SiMe 2ONaph) 3)2molecule has one of the largest known ZFS gaps of 3d-transition
metal based molecular magnets. Most others have ZFS gaps which are smaller by at least a factor
of 2-3, often more. Here, we computed the ZFS by performing independent AFQMC calculations
for each MJlevel; Sufﬁcient resolution was achieved with this approach. For computing the ZFS
for general molecular magnets, a higher resolution can be reached via correlated sampling, which
directly computes relative energies, such as the ZFS gaps, with signiﬁcantly reduced Monte Carlo
noise [72].
We computed the low-energy many-body spectrum of the Co(C(SiMe 2OH) 3)2molecule.
AFQMC can also be used to directly compute general observables, such as forces, electron den-
sity, and phonon/vibrational modes, via the back-propagation algorithm [73, 74]. The use of back-
propagation would follow essentially the same procedure as shown in Fig. 1 where the ﬁnal step
would be AFQMC with back-propagation instead of the energy-only calculations performed here.
This is, of course, highly desirable since structural details (e.g. ligand symmetry) and vibrational
properties are key elements of molecular magnet design. Much of the molecular magnet literature
relies upon the experimentally measured geometry of molecular magnets in order to perform ZFS
calculations. AFQMC offers a direct a route to the ab initio prediction of equilibrium geometries
as has been demonstrated in solids [75] which would greatly assist in the design of new molecular
magnets.
Molecular magnets are very large both in terms of their spatial extent, and the dimension of the
corresponding many-body Hilbert space. In the procedure described in Sec. II B, local embedding
AFQMC [47] is employed as a way to reduce the size of the active space while retaining system-
speciﬁc details. In the case of Co(C(SiMe 2OH) 3)2, local embedding led to a reduction in com-
putational cost by a factor of approximately 5000 relative to a hypothetical AFQMC calculation
performed using the full Hilbert space. Local embedding beneﬁts greatly from a cancellation of er-
rors in relative energy calculations, such as for the ZFS, and is systematically improvable towards
full AFQMC by increasing the localization radii ( Ro,Rv). Direct AFQMC computations of the full
molecular magnets without embedding is also rapidly becoming feasible, by taking advantage of
GPU-acceleration [76, 77] and efﬁcient multi-determinant trial wavefunction algorithms [50, 78].
18The combination of effective embedding approaches with these advances in computational efﬁ-
ciency will spur a large number of applications in molecular magnets and beyond.
