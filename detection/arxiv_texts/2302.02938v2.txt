Abstract
In the context of f(T,B )modiﬁed teleparallel gravity, we investigate the inﬂuence of torsion
scalarTand boundary term Bon the conﬁnement of both the gauge vector and Kalb-Ramond
ﬁelds. Both ﬁelds require a suitable coupling in ﬁve-dimensional braneworld scenarios to yield a
normalizable zero mode. We propose a Stueckelberg-like geometrical coupling that non-minimally
couples the ﬁelds to the torsion scalar and boundary term. To set up our braneworld models, we
use the ﬁrst-order formalism in which two kinds of superpotential are taken: sine-Gordon and φ4-
deformed. Thegeometricalcouplingisusedtoproducealocalizedzeromode. Moreover, weanalyze
the massive spectrum for both ﬁelds and obtain possible resonant massive modes. Furthermore,
we do not ﬁnd tachyonic modes leading to a consistent thick brane.

Since its formulation by Albert Einstein in 1916, general relativity (GR) has successfully
described a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. However, there remain several out-
standing questions, such as matter-antimatter asymmetry [1], dark matter [2], dark energy
[3], inﬂation [4], cosmological constant [5], and the hierarchy problem [6, 7], which have
motivated investigations into modiﬁed gravity theories. Among the simplest extensions of
GR aref(R)[8–10] andf(R,T)[11–14] gravity theories, which have garnered attention as
possible solutions to these open problems.
Constructing a nontrivial curvature-free spacetime has been explored within the context
of modiﬁed gravity theories, with the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR)
receiving particular attention [15–20]. In this theory, the tetrad (vielbein) is used as the
dynamic variable instead of the metric, and the gravitational action is deﬁned in terms
of the torsion scalar T. Analogous to the f(R)model for GR, the f(T)gravity [21–24]
represents a natural modiﬁcation of TEGR, with the main diﬀerence being that f(R)gen-
erates fourth-order equations while f(T)generates second-order equations. Recently, other
modiﬁed gravity models such as f(T,B)andf(T,T)gravities have been proposed and in-
vestigated in various contexts, including cosmology, black holes, wormholes, and braneworld
scenarios [25–43].
Concerning the possibility of extra dimensions, Lisa Randall and Raman Sundrum pro-
posed two groundbreaking papers [6, 7] that presented a solution to the hierarchy problem
by embedding our Universe as a brane in a warped ﬁve-dimensional spacetime. They argued
that gravity is free to propagate throughout the bulk. At the same time, the standard model
ﬁelds are conﬁned to the brane, explaining the observed weakness of gravity in our four-
dimensional spacetime. Since then, braneworld scenarios have been extensively investigated
[44]. In this sense, thick brane models [45–51] are a direct extension of the Randall-Sundrum
models and are supported by the addition of real scalar ﬁelds that induce an internal struc-
ture [52]. Many thick brane models have been proposed in various contexts, including the
Bloch brane [54–57], cuscuton braneworld [12, 48] and modiﬁed gravity such as f(R)grav-
ity [10, 11], f(R,T)gravity [12, 58], Gauss-Bonnet and teleparallel gravity [59, 60]. In the
braneworld context, it is crucial to investigate gravity localization and analyze how standard
model ﬁelds, including gauge ﬁelds [61] and fermions [62], are conﬁned to the brane. Gen-
2erally, a mechanism is required to create a normalizable zero mode, which can be achieved
through non-trivial couplings that typically depend on the extra dimension. For example, in
Ref. [54], it was considered a non-minimal coupling between the gauge and Kalb-Ramond
ﬁelds and the background scalar ﬁeld directly in the kinetic term. In Refs. [55–57], a similar
coupling was employed, but considering the dilaton ﬁeld.
As demonstrated by several studies, geometric couplings have been an essential mech-
anism for localizing gauge ﬁelds [63–69]. These couplings can be introduced in either the
kinetic or massive term of the ﬁeld equation, leading to a normalizable zero mode. However,
in ﬁeld theory, a mass term breaks the gauge symmetry. To overcome this diﬃculty, we
can utilize the Stueckelberg mechanism [70, 71]. This procedure introduces an auxiliary
scalar ﬁeld to restore the gauge symmetry. Therefore, it would be interesting to extend this
investigation into a ﬁve-dimensional warped spacetime [67–69].
This work studies the localization of gauge vector and Kalb-Ramond ﬁelds in f(T,B)-
braneworld scenarios. Geometrical coupling is achieved through a Stueckelberg-like term,
non-minimally coupling the ﬁelds to the torsion scalar and the boundary term. The analy-
sis employs supersymmetric quantum mechanics and demonstrates the absence of tachyon
modes, which are crucial for the consistency of the physical system [72, 73]. The conﬁne-
ment of the zero mode for abelian gauge ﬁelds is also demonstrated, complementing previous
studiesongravitylocalization[40]andfermionlocalization[41]insimilarthickbranemodels.
Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. (II), the main aspects of f(T,B)gravity,
as well as the braneworld scenarios constructed in such gravity, are brieﬂy reviewed. In
Sec. (III), a Stueckelberg-like coupling is employed to localize both gauge vector and the
Kalb-Ramond ﬁelds on thick brane generated by a single real scalar ﬁeld in f(T,B)gravity.
Finally, our conclusions are discussed in Sec. (IV).
II. THICK BRANE IN f(T,B )GRAVITY
Let us begin by brieﬂy establishing our notation and conventions for braneworld models
in the context of teleparallel gravity and its generalization to f(T,B)gravity.
The usual description of general relativity as a Riemannian spacetime involves a metric
gABas basic dynamical object and a covariant derivative ∇Mconstructed with the Levi-
Civita connection ΓABC=1
2gAD(∂BgDC+∂CgDB−∂DgBC). This connection is torsion-
3free and obeys the metricity condition ∇MgNP= 0by deﬁnition. On the other hand, in
teleparallel theories of gravity, the fundamental dynamical variables are the tetrad ﬁelds
(or vierbein) haM, responsible for the conversion from the local Lorentz frame to spacetime
coordinates through the relation
AMN···=ha
Mhb
N···Aab···, (1)
whereAMN···represents the covariant components of an arbitrary tensor ﬁeld in a coordinate
basis andAab···the corresponding covariant components in a local Lorentz frame. In this
way, the tetrads and their inverse hMatransform the metric and the inverse metric gMNto
the Minkowski form ηabvia
gMN=ha
Mhb
Nηab, gMN=hM
ahN
bηab, (2)
where the bulk coordinate indices are denoted by capital Latin index M= 0,...,D−1,
whereas the vielbein indices are denoted by Latin indices a= 0,...,D−1. Also, the
Minkowski metric has the signature (−,+,···,+). For consistency, the tetrads and their
inverse must obey the orthogonality relations
ha
MhM
b=δa
b, hM
aha
N=δM
N. (3)
In a curvature-free formulation of the teleparallel theory, we can deﬁne an object called
the Weitzenböck connection by [18, 19, 25]
/tildewideΓP
MN≡hP
a∂Mha
N, (4)
such that the condition of absolute parallelism, namely [15]
/tildewider∇Qha
M=∂Qha
M−/tildewideΓP
QMha
P= 0, (5)
is consistently satisﬁed. It can be explicitly veriﬁed that the Riemann and Ricci tensors are
identically zero when calculated with the Weitzenböck connection. In turn, we can deﬁne
the associated torsion tensor as
TP
MN=/tildewideΓP
MN−/tildewideΓP
NM. (6)
The diﬀerence between the Weitzenböck and Levi-Civita connections deﬁne the contortion
tensor, which can be expressed via torsion tensor as
KP
MN=1
2(TP
MN+TMP
N+TNP
M). (7)
4The contortion tensor has two traces. One of them is identically null KPMP= 0, while the
other is related to the torsion trace vector TM≡TPMPby
KP
PM=−KMP
P=−TM. (8)
Another relevant object related to the contortion and torsion tensor is the superpotential
tensor, which can be written as
SPMN=1
2(KM
PN+δM
PTN−δN
PTM). (9)
The link between the GR and TEGR is established through the relation [19, 25]
R=−T−2∇MTN
MN, (10)
where the Ricci scalar is calculated in terms of the Levi-Civita connection, and the scalar
T, called the torsion scalar, is given by
T=SPMNTP
MN. (11)
From Eq. (10), one can identify the boundary term as
B≡−2∇MTN
MN=−2
h∂M(hTM), (12)
whereh=√−g, withgbeing the determinant of the metric tensor.
Hence, one can see that GR and TEGR are two equivalent theories of gravity since the
Ricci scalar and the torsion scalar are related by a boundary term, namely R=−T+B.
However, this equivalence does not hold in more general theories of gravity, like f(R)and
f(T)gravity, which lead to modiﬁed equations of motion [20, 25, 31].
A general class of modiﬁed teleparallel gravity can be constructed by using an arbitrary
function of TandB, resulting in what is known as f(T,B)gravity [27, 29–31, 34, 40, 42].
In this framework, the gravitational action in a D-dimensional spacetime can conveniently
be expressed as
SG=
dDxh/parenleftbigg1
2κDf(T,B) +Lm/parenrightbigg
, (13)
whereκDis a suitable constant with mass dimension [κD] =M2−D(in natural units), and
Lmis the matter Lagrangian which will be introduced later.
5The gravitational ﬁeld equations follow from the action (13) by varying with respect to
the vierbein (See Ref. [25] and references therein for a detailed derivation). Explicitly, we
ﬁnd

∂f(T,B)/∂B. In the above equation the energy-momentum tensor is deﬁned as
TM
a=1
hδ(hLm)

For our present purposes, it is convenient to write the equations of motion in terms of
spacetime indices only. It can be shown that Eq. (14) takes the following covariant form
[25, 33]:

whereGMN≡RMN−1
2gMNRis the Einstein tensor calculated with the Levi-Civita con-
nection andTMN≡haNTMais the standard energy-momentum tensor.
After deﬁning the main concepts of f(T,B)gravity, we proceed to develop thick brane
scenarios to investigate the localization of gauge ﬁelds, as detailed in the following section.
In particular, we consider a warped ﬁve-dimensional spacetime where the metric is given by
[6, 7, 44–51]
ds2=e2A(y)ηµνdxµdxν+dy2, (17)
withηµν=Diag(−1,1,1,1)being the Minkowski spacetime metric, and the indices µ,ν
run over 0 to 3. The function A(y)characterizes the warp factor and will be ﬁxed with the
particular potential choice.
Now, let us take the funfbein (vielbein deﬁned in the ﬁve-dimensional spacetime) as
ha
M=
eAδµ
ν0
0 1
, (18)
6which ensures that the warped metric (17) is reproduced via relations (2). For this choice,
we can determine the torsion scalar and the boundary term through Eqs. (11-12) as
T=−12A/prime2,
B=−8A/prime/prime−32A/prime2, (19)
where prime (/prime)stands for derivative concerning the extra-coordinate y.
Consistent with many braneworld scenarios proposed in the literature [40–43, 60, 61] , we
assume that a single scalar ﬁeld generates the thick brane and has a standard Lagrangian
given by
Lm=−1
2∂Mφ∂Mφ−V(φ), (20)
whereφ≡φ(y)depends only on the extra dimension y. Then, this choice leads to the
following equation of motion for the matter ﬁeld
gMN∇M∇Nφ−∂V
∂φ= 0, (21)
with the associated energy-momentum tensor as
TMN=∂Mφ∂Nφ−1
2gMN(2V+∂Pφ∂pφ). (22)
By evaluating the ﬁeld equations (16) and (21) under the conditions speciﬁed above, we
obtain the following equations:
−1
2f−/parenleftBig
4A/prime2+A/prime/prime/parenrightBig
(4fB+ 3fT) +f/prime/prime

B−4A/prime/primefB=−κ5V+1
2κ5φ/prime2, (24)
φ/prime/prime+ 4A/primeφ/prime=∂V
∂φ. (25)
After obtaining the gravitational ﬁeld equations in the thick brane scenario, the next
step is to specify the form of the f(T,B)function. Since our purpose is to modify general
relativity by considering the presence of torsion and an additional boundary term, we will
limit ourselves to the most straightforward modiﬁcation of TEGR, namely, a linear function
given byf(T,B) =c1T+c2B. Here,c1andc2are the parameters that control the deviation
from the usual gravity models, i.e., making c1=−1andc2= 1we fall back into general
relativity, but if we consider c1=−1andc2= 0we fall back into the usual teleparallelism.
7A. First-order formalism
In order to ﬁnd analytical solutions for our f(T,B)-braneworld system, as described
by Eqs. (23)-(25), we employ the Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerﬁeld (BPS) formalism [72,
73]. This useful technique enables us to transform the second-order coupled ﬁeld equations
into ﬁrst-order equations by utilizing auxiliary superpotentials [44, 49, 51]. In the context
of modiﬁed teleparallel gravities, such a formalism has recently been used to ﬁnd brane
solutions in f(T)[58, 59] and f(T,T)[43] gravity models.
Considering f(T,B) =c1T+c2B, and ﬁxing κ5= 2for convenience, we can rewrite Eqs.
(23) and (24) as
3
2c1A/prime/prime=φ/prime2, (26)
−3c1A/prime2=φ/prime2
2−V. (27)
Note that the inﬂuence of the boundary term disappears, i.e., the parameter c2does not
aﬀect our solutions. This is expected for this scenario, as the same result occurs in usual
teleparallelism, where the limiting term Bcancels out in the equations of motion.
To implement the ﬁrst-order formalism, we introduce a superpotential W(φ)of the form
A/prime=−αW(φ), (28)
whereαis an arbitrary constant. Hence, the second-order equation (26) turns into
φ/prime=−3
2c1αWφ. (29)
The potential Vis obtained through Eq. (27), such that
V(φ) = 3c1α2W2+9

It is noteworthy that the default GR equations are restored when we consider c1=−1

V(φ) =W2

ρ(y) =e2A

φ
. (33)
8Now that we have set up our f(T,B)-braneworld model, let us examine the modiﬁcations
to the brane core and source (scalar ﬁeld). For this purpose, we consider two types of
superpotentials. The ﬁrst is a sine-Gordon type superpotential [44, 72, 73]:
W(φ) =β2sin/parenleftbiggφ
β/parenrightbigg
. (34)
The second one is the deformed superpotential written as [45, 53, 55 ?]
Wβ(φ) =β
2β−1φ2β−1
β−β
2β+ 1φ2β+1
β, (35)
where the parameter β= 1,3,5,...is an odd integer. The function Wβ(φ)was originally
introduced in Ref. [ ?] for ﬂat spacetime. It was inspired by the work on deformed
defects [53] and was obtained using a deformation procedure proposed in that work. In this
procedure, the superpotential is deformed such that double-kink solutions are generated.
To understand the process, let us write the superpotential associated with the standard φ4
models as
/tildewiderW(φ) =φ−φ3/3, (36)
from which one obtains the potential in ﬂat spacetime:
/tildewideV(φ) =1
2(1−φ2)2. (37)
In Refs. [53 ?], the deformation procedure was applied by introducing the function f(φ) =
φ1/β, where the parameter β= 1,3,5, ...is an odd integer. The deformed superpotential
Wβ(φ)can be obtained directly from/tildewiderW(φ)through the relation:
df
dφdWβ
dφ=d/tildewiderW
dφ[φ→f(φ)], (38)
where in the right-hand side, we replace φwithf(φ)after taking the derivative of/tildewiderW.
Finally, we write Wβ(φ) = 1/β,Wβ(φ). This superpotential was studied in the context of
thick branes in Ref. [45], where it was shown to exhibit a richer internal structure and the
splitting brane eﬀect.

9which is a simple thick brane solution. From Eq. (28), we obtain the form of the warp

A(y) =2β2

Fig. 1 shows the plots for the warp factor e2A, scalar ﬁeld φ, potentialV(φ), and energy
densityρ. It is evident that the torsion parameter c1has a signiﬁcant impact on the results.

which becomes more pronounced with decreasing c1(Fig. 1(b)). The potential also responds
to the changes in the kink-like ﬁeld, resulting in modiﬁcations to its shape as c1varies (Fig.
1(c)). These changes directly aﬀect the behavior of the energy density, which becomes more
localized with decreasing c1(Fig. 1(d)).
2. Deformed superpotential
For theφ4-deformed superpotential (35), the equations (29) and (30) become

. (44)
It is interesting to note that when we set β= 1, we obtain the φ4potential in a Randall-
Sundrum-like scenario. However, for values of β= 3,5,7,..., the potential exhibits three
minima: one at φ= 0, and two more at φ±1, as can be seen in Fig. 2( c). Furthermore, the
potential is also inﬂuenced by the torsion parameter, as shown by its dependence on c1.
In Fig. 2(b), we see how the c1parameter modiﬁes the behavior of the φﬁeld. Forβ= 1
the scalar ﬁeld solution is kink-like. When we consider values of β= 3,5,7,...the solutions
of the scalar ﬁeld become double-kink-like.
From Eq. (28), we can obtain the solution for the warp factor as

Forβ > 1, it is possible to observe a brane split process. We can easily see from Fig.
2(d) that the energy density splits into two peaks, thereby becoming more localized as the
value of the parameter c1is decreased.
12III. GAUGE FIELDS LOCALIZATION
In this section, we will analyze the trapping of abelian gauge ﬁelds on brane scenarios in
f(T,B)gravity by considering a non-minimal Stueckelberg-like coupling between the ﬁelds
and the scalar torsion and boundary term.
It is well known that ﬁve-dimensional thick brane models do not yield a normalizable
zero mode for both gauge and Kalb-Ramond ﬁelds when taking the standard action for
these ﬁelds. We can illustrate this problem by considering the following ﬁve-dimensional
standard action for gauge vector ﬁeld
SA=−1
4
d5xhFMNFMN, (48)
whereFMN=∂MAN−∂NAMis the ﬁeld strength. Now, employing Kaluza-Klein (KK)
decomposition, Aν(x,y) =/summationtextaν(x)χ(y), the action (48) is rewritten as
SA=−1
4
dyχ(y)2
d4xfµν(x)fµν(x). (49)
withfµν=∂µaν−∂νaµ.
In the above expression, xrepresents the coordinates of our universe, and yrepresents
the extra-dimension coordinate. However, we can see that the eﬀective action (49) diverges
due to the absence of a warp factor. This means that the gauge ﬁeld zero mode is not
localized on the brane. To address this issue, various coupling functions that depend on the
extra dimension have been proposed in the literature [54, 63]. For instance, let us assume
the following action for gauge vector ﬁeld
SA=−1
4
d5xhG(y)FMNFMN. (50)
Applying again the KK decomposition we obtain
SA=−1
4
dyG(y)χ(y)2
d4xfµνfµν. (51)
From Eq. (51), we write the condition for localization of gauge ﬁeld as being

dyG(y)χ(y)2<∞. (52)
The function G(y)can be a function of the background scalar ﬁeld, as it was studied in
[54], the dilaton scalar ﬁeld [55–57, 61], or a function of the curvature scalar proposed in
13[69]. On the other hand, in the context of modiﬁed teleparallel gravity, it can be adopted
as a function of the scalar torsion as it was studied in Ref [60]. It is also possible to admit
a mechanism of localization by adding to the action (48) a Proca-like term given by
SPL=−1
2
d5xhG(y)AMAM, (53)
where the function G(y)plays the role of a dynamical mass for gauge vector ﬁeld. This
mechanism was studied in [68] by considering G(y) =−1/16R. However, the action (53)
has the disadvantage of breaking the 5D gauge symmetry. In this work, we are interested
in exploring an alternative method studied by Vaquera and Corradini in Ref. [67], where a
Stueckelberg-like action is assumed as
SSL=−1
2
d5xhG(y)(AM−∂MS)2, (54)
whereSis the Stueckelberg-like scalar ﬁeld. This action has the advantage of being gauge-
invariant. It is important to point out that the Stueckelberg-like ﬁeld acts as an auxiliary
ﬁeld and does not represent a physical degree of freedom, and it will not aﬀect either the
zero-mode or the massive modes as it will be shown ahead. In this sense, we introduced the
Stueckelberg-likescalarﬁeldonlytoobtainagauge-invariantmechanismofﬁeldlocalization.
Moreover, such a mechanism can be straightforwardly extended to the Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld
[67].
Now, our goal is to use this kind of coupling to investigate the localization of the gauge
vector and Kalb-Ramond ﬁelds on the braneworld scenarios constructed in f(T,B)gravity.
To this end, we will consider a function Gthat depends on the torsion scalar and the
boundary term.
A. Gauge vector ﬁeld
Based on Ref. [67], we deﬁne a ﬁve-dimensional Stueckelberg-like action for gauge vector
ﬁeld as follows:
SA−SL=
d5xh/bracketleftbigg
−1
4FMNFMN−1
2G(T,B)(AM−∂MS)2/bracketrightbigg
, (55)
whereG(T,B)is a suitable function of the torsion scalar and the boundary term. Later, we
will adopt a particular choice for this function, which is able to produce a normalizable zero
14mode for the gauge vector ﬁeld. It is worth mentioning that action (55) is invariant under
the ﬁve-dimensional gauge transformations
AM→AM+∂MΛ,
S→S+ Λ. (56)
Now, we vary the action (55) to obtain the following equation of motion for AMandS
∂M/parenleftbigg
e4AgMLgNPFLP/parenrightbigg
=−e4AG(T,B)gNP(AP−∂PS),
∂M/parenleftbigg
e4AG(T,B)gML(AL−∂LS)/parenrightbigg
= 0. (57)
The ﬁeldAMcan be parameterized as
AM= (Aµ,A4) = (/hatwideAµ+∂µφ,A 4), (58)
being/hatwideAµthe transverse component of Aµwith the condition ∂µ/hatwideAµ= 0, while∂µφlongitudi-
nal component. These components transform under four-dimensional gauge transformation
as follows
/hatwideAµ→/hatwideAµ,
A4→A4+ Λ/prime,
S→S+ Λ,
φ→φ+ Λ. (59)
With these transformation, it is convenient to redeﬁne A4andSas
A4→λ+φ/prime,
S→ρ+φ. (60)
The above redeﬁnition it is useful since the new ﬁelds are invariant. Now, by considering
this new parameterization, we obtain the following set of equations
[e−2A+∂2
4+ 2A/prime∂4−G]/hatwideAν= 0, (61)
∂4(e2Aλ)−e2AGρ= 0, (62)
e2Aλ+e4AG(ρ/prime−λ) = 0, (63)
e2AGρ+∂4[e4AGρ/prime−λ)] = 0, (64)
15where=ηµν∂µ∂ν.
Now that we have obtained the set of equations of motion, the next step is to study the
localization of the transverse component/hatwideAν. It is important to note that the scalar part
is decoupled from the vector one. Therefore, the transverse component can be analyzed
separately. With this in mind, let us adopt the Kaluza-Klein decomposition for/hatwideAνas
follows:
/hatwideAν(x,y) =/summationdisplay
aν(x)χ(y), (65)
withaν(x) =m2aν(x). Thus, the equation (61) becomes
χ/prime/prime+ 2A/primeχ/prime−Gχ=−m2e−2Aχ. (66)
By considering the conformal coordinate dz=e−Ady, the above equation reduce to
¨χ+˙A˙χ−Ge2Aχ=−m2χ, (67)
where the dot indicate diﬀerentiation with respect to conformal coordinate z. In order to
analyze the zero mode and massive mode, the equation (67) is written in Schrödinger-like
form by means of following change χ(z) =e−A
2ψ(z), thus, we get
−¨ψ+Veffψ=m2ψ, (68)
where we write the eﬀective potential Veffas
Veff=1
4˙A2+1
2¨A+e2AG. (69)
We can now analyze the inﬂuence of scalar torsion and the boundary term on the local-
ization of the transverse component/hatwideAµ. To do this, we need to choose a particular form
for the function G. Let us adopt a linear combination, i.e., G(T,B) =γ1T+γ2B. Note
that when we ﬁx γ1=c1andγ2=c2,G(T,B)has the same form as the function f(T,B)
deﬁned previously in Sec. II. This choice of Gis interesting because it allows us to recover
the inﬂuence of the boundary term B. Furthermore, our potential takes a simple form that
guarantees localized modes. With this choice, the eﬀective potential (69) becomes
Veff=/bracketleftbigg1
4−12(γ1+ 2γ2)/bracketrightbigg
˙A2+/parenleftbigg1
2−8γ2/parenrightbigg
¨A, (70)
which behaves like an even function. This assures us that the massive solutions of Eq.
(68) can be even or odd. To numerically solve Eq. (68), let us use the following boundary
16conditions
ϕeven(0) =c, ∂zϕeven(0) = 0,
ϕodd(0) = 0, ∂zϕodd(0) =c, (71)
which represent the massive modes even and odd parity [62]. Here cis just a constant.
The last step is to ensure a normalizable zero mode and positivity (absence of tachyon
modes). We have veriﬁed that the theory remains stable because equation (68) can be
factorized in the form [67]:

wherek0is just a normalization constant. For γ1= 1andγ2=−1, we recover the massless

potentialV(z)for both Sine-Gordon (Fig. 3) and deformed superpotential (Fig. 6) where
it will be considered γ1=c1andγ2=c2.
1. Sine-Gordon superpotential
The inﬂuence of torsion and boundary term (by varying the parameters c1andc2respec-
tively) on the potential and its direct inﬂuence on massless modes can be analyzed. As the
value of the torsion parameter decreases, the potential increases its maximum (peaks and
valleys) making the massless modes more localized (Fig.3.( a) and (b)). A similar eﬀect is
seen when we decrease the value of the boundary term parameter (Fig.3.( c) and (d)).
Figures 4 and 5 show the numerical solutions of Eq. (68). In Fig. 4, we observe the
changein thesolutions asthe masseigenvaluesare modiﬁed. Increasingthemass eigenvalues
causes the solutions to have more oscillations and lower amplitudes. However, when we ﬁx
the mass value and vary the torsion parameters and boundary term, a more interesting

behavior emerges. Speciﬁcally, decreasing the value of the torsion parameter causes the
even and odd solutions to move closer to the brane core and increase in amplitude (Fig.
5.(a) and (b)). Similarly, decreasing the value of the boundary term parameter leads to
similar behavior in the solutions (Fig. 5.( c) and (d)).
2. Deformed superpotential
For the deformed brane, we obtain a potential that represents the solutions obtained
in section II, where the brane tries to split. The potential has an internal structure with
minimums which suﬀer the inﬂuence of parameters c1,2. When we vary the values of the tor-
sion parameters and the boundary term, these minimums tend to become more accentuated
(Fig. 6.(a) and (c)). Massless modes feel the change in potential, tending to become more

localized as we decrease the parameters c1andc2(Fig. 5.(b) and (d)).
Figure 7 illustrates the behavior of massive modes by varying the parameters that control
the inﬂuence of torsion and boundary term. When decreasing the value of the torsion
parameter, we decrease the amplitudes that are shifted closer to the brane (Fig. 7.( a)
and (b)). On the other hand, when we decrease the boundary term values, the oscillation
amplitudes increase (Fig. 7.( c) and (d)). A similar behavior was seen in Ref. [55], where
the gauge ﬁeld localization was addressed in the context of general relativity by considering
a gauge-invariant coupling with the dilaton ﬁeld. In our case, we show that only the torsion
scalar and boundary term are enough to gauge ﬁeld zero-mode trapping. As we pointed
out before, although we have assumed a Stueckelberg-like ﬁeld to obtain a gauge-invariant
action, we could decouple an equation only for transverse component/hatwideAµthat allows our
analysis. In this sense, the Stueckelberg-like ﬁeld works as an auxiliary ﬁeld, thereby not
contributing directly to gauge ﬁeld zero-mode.
B. Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld
In order to study the trapping of the Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld on thick brane, we can use
an analogous procedure to that discussed in the previous section. Thus, the action can be

B4µ→B4µ+∂4Λµ−∂µΛ4. (78)
22As in the previous section, it is useful to use the following deﬁnitions
λµ=B4µ−φµ+∂µC4,
λµν=∂µλν−∂νλµ,
ρµ=Cµ−φµ,
ρµν=∂µρν−∂νρµ. (79)

∂µλµν+e2AG(ρ/prime−λ) = 0, (82)
G∂µρµν+∂4[e2A(ρ−λ)] = 0. (83)
Similarly to the gauge ﬁeld case, it is possible to write the transverse component/hatwideBµν
with the vector part isolatedly. The KK decomposition for/hatwideBµνis given by
/hatwideBµν(x,y) =/summationdisplay
bµν(x)χ(y). (84)
Substituting (84) into (80), we get
χ/prime/prime−Gχ=−m2e−2Aχ. (85)
Again, we use the conformal coordinate dz=e−Adyto write the equation (85) as
¨χ−˙A˙χ−Ge2Aχ=−m2χ, (86)
which can be put into a Schrödinger-like equation through the change χ(z) =eA

thereby becoming

with the eﬀective potential being

Using the same G(T,B)function as in the previous section, i.e., G(T,B) =γ1T+γ2B,
the potential (88) takes the form

23Again, we use the operators deﬁned in the previous section to show that there are no tachyon

Atthispoint, itisworthobservingthattheonlydiﬀerencebetweenthepotentialobtained
for the gauge vector ﬁeld (70) and the potential obtained for the KR ﬁeld (89) is only one
sign in a constant. Therefore, the behavior of the solutions (massive and massless modes)
for the KR ﬁeld are similar to those already demonstrated for the gauge ﬁeld. In this sense,
it would be repetitive to represent such solutions graphically.
IV. FINAL REMARKS
In this work, we have considered thick braneworld models in the context of modiﬁed
teleparallel theories. We ﬁrst introduced the basic concepts of teleparallel gravity, which are
fundamentally diﬀerent from those of general relativity. To construct a thick brane scenario
inf(T,B)gravity, we used a Randall-Sundrum-like line element and a standard single scalar
ﬁeld. Employing the ﬁrst-order formalism, we considered two superpotential models, sine-
Gordon and φ4-deformed, and a linear form for the function f(T,B) =c1T+c2B, where
the parameters c1,2represent a possible extension of usual teleparallelism. As we showed,
the warp factor depends on these parameters.
As we have pointed out, abelian gauge ﬁelds are not conﬁned on the brane when a stan-
dard action is taken. In this sense, a suitable coupling is required to produce a normalizable
zero mode. Various types of coupling have been proposed in the literature to address this
issue. In this work, we introduce a new localization mechanism to analyze the trapping of
the gauge vector and the Kalb-Ramond ﬁelds in the context of f(T,B)gravity. Speciﬁcally,
we introduce a Stueckelberg-like interaction to non-minimally couple the ﬁelds to the torsion
scalar and boundary term.
In the sequel, we have studied a mechanism based on Stueckelberg-like geometrical cou-
pling that supports the trapping of massless mode for the transverse component of the gauge
vector and the Kalb-Ramond ﬁelds. These couplings allow us to analyze the inﬂuence of
torsion scalar and boundary term on the localization of these ﬁelds. The parameters c1,2
24play an important role since they control the localization of massless and massive modes
and directly aﬀect the eﬀective potential Veff. Our results generalize those obtained in [55]
and [61] with a dilaton coupling in the context of general relativity. Moreover, a remarkable
fact about our coupling is the absence of massive tachyonic modes for both ﬁelds, where we
have used the Schrödinger approach. All these conditions demonstrate the consistency of
ourf(T,B)-thick brane models.
