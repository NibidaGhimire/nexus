ABSTRACT
We present the ﬁrst results on the spatial distribution of dust attenuation at 1:0<z<2:4traced by the Balmer
Decrement, H /H, in emission-line galaxies using deep JWST NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the CAnadian
NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). H and H emission line maps of emission-line galaxies are
extracted and stacked in bins of stellar mass for two grism redshift bins, 1:0<zgrism<1:7and1:7<zgrism<2:4.
Surface brightness proﬁles for the Balmer Decrement are measured and radial proﬁles of the dust attenuation
towards H ,AH, are derived. In both redshift bins, the integrated Balmer Decrement increases with stellar
mass. Lower mass ( 7:66Log( M/M)<10:0) galaxies have centrally concentrated, negative dust attenuation
proﬁles whereas higher mass galaxies ( 10:06Log( M/M)<11:1) have ﬂat dust attenuation proﬁles. The total
dust obscuration is mild, with on average 0:070:07and0:140:07mag in the low and high redshift bins
respectively. We model the typical light proﬁles of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts and stellar masses
withGALFIT and apply both uniform and radially varying dust attenuation corrections based on our integrated
Balmer Decrements and radial dust attenuation proﬁles. If these galaxies were observed with typical JWST
NIRSpec slit spectroscopy ( 0:20:500shutters), on average, H star formation rates (SFRs) measured after
slit-loss corrections assuming uniform dust attenuation will overestimate the total SFR by 621% and269%
at 1:06z<1:7 and 1:76z<2:4 respectively.

1.INTRODUCTION
Corresponding author: Jasleen Matharu
jasleen.matharu@nbi.ku.dkIt is now well-established that galaxy evolution is a compli-
cated interplay between various physical processes, including
the inﬂow and outﬂow of gas, as well as its recycling. Star
formation in a galaxy primarily depends upon its gas reservoir
(Schmidt 1959; Kennicutt 1998; Kennicutt & Evans 2012).
How this star formation propagates through galaxies can de-
termine how their structural growth proceeds.arXiv:2303.17624v1  [astro-ph.GA]  30 Mar 20232 M ATHARU ET AL .
Determining where the star formation process starts and
ﬁnishes in a galaxy is only possible with spatially resolved
studies of star formation tracers. At z&0:5, ground-based in-
tegral ﬁeld spectroscopy and space-based slitless (or “grism")
spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope ’s (HST) Wide
Field Camera 3 (WFC3) have allowed us to measure the spa-
tial distribution of ongoing star formation in galaxies using
the H emission line as a star formation tracer. Some of
these studies have revealed the inside-out growth and subse-
quent inside-out quenching of galaxies (Förster Schreiber et al.
2009, 2018; Law et al. 2009; Nelson et al. 2012, 2013, 2016a;
Tacchella et al. 2015; Wisnioski et al. 2015, 2019; Wilman
et al. 2020; Matharu et al. 2021; Matharu et al. 2022; Noirot
& Sawicki 2022).
Whilst H emission predominantly traces emission from
young O and B stars, it is susceptible to dust attenuation. Since
dust preferentially attenuates light at bluer wavelengths, dust
attenuation towards H emitting regions can be measured by
comparing the ratio of the H ﬂux to the H ﬂux. Known as
the Balmer Decrement, the H /Hratio has been shown to in-
crease with SFR, stellar mass and attenuation towards the stars
(Calzetti et al. 2000; Wild et al. 2011; Domínguez et al. 2013;
Momcheva et al. 2013; Price et al. 2014; Reddy et al. 2015;
Shivaei et al. 2015) but not vary signiﬁcantly with redshift
out to z6(Shapley et al. 2022, 2023). Spatially resolved
measurements of the Balmer Decrement at high redshift will
help complete the picture of galaxy assembly, revealing the
location of obscured star formation in galaxies.
The power of space-based slitless spectroscopy lies in its
high spatial resolution, providing 2D emission-line maps of
high-redshift galaxies. However, the lack of a slit mask leads
to 2D spectra for all the sources in the ﬁeld-of-view. The
result is contamination of spectra from neighbouring sources
and high backgrounds. These issues limit the sensitivity of
space-based grism spectroscopy. Conversely, multi-object slit
spectroscopy can reach higher sensitivities but has limited spa-
tial resolution for a limited sample selected from pre-imaging.
To account for the lack of spatial coverage, slit loss correc-
tions need to be applied. With JWST NIRSpec, this has been
done by using the NIRCam photometry of the galaxies, over-
laying the shutter position and comparing how much ﬂux
passes through the shutter versus the total ﬂux measurement
from the photometry (Larson et al. 2023). The spectra are
then scaled to match the total ﬂux from the photometry. The
Balmer Decrement is then measured from total line ﬂuxes in
the spectra, providing a single value of AHthat is used to dust-
correct SFR measurements. This dust correction assumes light
from the galaxy that is outside of the slit is attenuated by the
same amount as the light from the galaxy that passes through
the slit. However, spatially resolved Balmer Decrements mea-
sured from HST WFC3 space-based slitless spectroscopy have
shown that 9:06Log( M/M)<11:0galaxies at z1:4havenegative dust attenuation proﬁles that are concentrated within
the inner 1 kpc (Nelson et al. 2016b), indicating that this as-
sumption may be invalid. In an era when many studies will
exploit JWST NIRSpec to study SFRs and galaxy assembly
through cosmic time, it is timely to test the validity of such
assumptions.
In this paper, we extend high-redshift spatially resolved
Balmer Decrement measurements out to z2:4, into the peak
of cosmic star formation (Madau & Dickinson 2014), with
spatially resolved H and H emission line maps from JWST
NIRISS slitless spectroscopy.
All magnitudes quoted are in the AB system, logarithms
are in base 10 and we assume a CDM cosmology with

m= 0:307,
= 0:693andH0= 67:7kms-1Mpc-1(Planck
Collaboration XIII 2016).
2.DATASET
We use JWST observations of galaxies in the background
of the z= 0:4galaxy cluster MACS J0417-1154 that were
taken from 12th-17th October 2022 as part of the NIRISS
GTO Program #1208, The Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Clus-
ter Survey (CANUCS, Willott et al. 2022). Observations
consist of two NIRISS pointings, one centered on the clus-
ter center and the other coincident with a ﬂanking ﬁeld1that
has existing HST WFC3/UVIS imaging (HST-G0-16667, PI:
Brada ˇc). Each ﬁeld is observed with both the GR150R and
GR150C grisms through the F115W, F150W and F200W
ﬁlters. Total exposure times are 10822 seconds in F115W,
5411 seconds in F150W and F200W for the ﬂanking ﬁeld and
19240 seconds in all three ﬁlters for the cluster ﬁeld. We pro-
cess all the imaging and slitless spectroscopy with the Grism
redshift & line analysis software, Grizli (Brammer 2022).
Grizli performs full end-to-end processing of space-based
slitless spectroscopic datasets. For full details on Grizli
and its data products, we refer the reader to Matharu et al.
(2021), Simons et al. (2020) and Noirot et al. (2022). In
summary, raw data is downloaded from the Mikulski Archive
for Space Telescopes (MAST) and pre-processed for cosmic
rays, ﬂat-ﬁelding, sky subtraction, astrometric corrections and
alignment (S. Gonzaga, W. Hack, A. Fruchter 2012; Brammer
et al. 2015; Brammer 2016). Contamination models (which
correct for overlapping spectra from nearby sources) for each
pointing are generated and subtracted for each grism spectrum
of interest.
2.1. Grism redshift ﬁtting, Sample Selection & Stellar
Masses
When deriving grism redshifts for each source, we ﬁt the
grism spectra and multiwavelength photometry simultane-
ously. Figure 1 shows this ﬁtting along with the resulting

emission-line maps that are extracted from the data for a high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) galaxy in the cluster ﬁeld that is
in our sample. For more details on the photometry and image
processing see Noirot et al. (2022) and Asada et al. (2022).
Fits for all sources are checked by eye for secure grism red-
shifts. We deﬁne a secure grism redshift by (1) The Spectral
Energy Distribution (SED) model is a good ﬁt to the photo-
metric and grism spectroscopic points (red line in Figure 1)
and (2) there are at least two features that constrain the log
p(z). That is either two emission lines or one emission line
and a Balmer break. This last criterion is the same as quality
1 for the SMACS grism redshift catalog (Noirot et al. 2022).
We then re-ﬁt all sources with secure grism redshifts with-
out photometry, but constrain the ﬁtting to a narrow redshift
range around the initially determined grism redshift. This of-
ten allows for cleaner emission line maps, especially in cases
where the Grizli scaling to photometry leads to over- or
under-subtraction of the continuum. Those galaxies with in-
tegrated Balmer Decrements from Grizli (see Section 2.3)
with errors larger than 100% of their measured value are re-
moved from the sample. Galaxies in the cluster ﬁeld with
lensing magniﬁcation greater than four are removed. The
median magniﬁcation for galaxies in the sample that reside
in the cluster ﬁeld is two. The model of the cluster’s lens-
ing magniﬁcation distribution is obtained using Lenstool
(Kneib et al. 1993; Jullo et al. 2007), further details of which
are described in Strait et al. (2023) and Desprez 2023, in prep.
Measuring Balmer Decrement proﬁles with our dataset re-
quires H and H to fall within ﬁlters F115W and F150W
or F150W and F200W. This sets a maximum redshift rangeof1:0<z<2:4for our study. Our ﬁnal sample consists of
56 galaxies in the cluster ﬁeld and 61 galaxies in the ﬂanking
ﬁeld that have both a H and H emission-line map extracted.
During the grism redshift ﬁtting process, we avoid biasing
the sample towards dust-free galaxies by not imposing any
SNR thresholds on the detections of H and H . Bad pix-
els and neighbouring sources in all the H and H emission
line maps are then masked. We split this sample into two
grism redshifts bins, 1:0<zgrism<1:7and1:7<zgrism<2:4,
containing 58 and 59 galaxies respectively. We rescale our
Hﬂuxes and surface brightness proﬁles down for the con-
tribution of [N II] using the Zahid et al. (2014) relation as in
Nelson et al. (2016b) throughout this paper.
We calculate the stellar masses of our ﬁnal sample of galax-
ies with Dense Basis (Iyer et al. 2019) at the grism red-
shifts obtained from Grizli (0.01). The Dense Basis
atlas was generated with a ﬂat speciﬁc star formation rate
prior, Calzetti et al. (2000) dust law, Chabrier (2003) Initial
Mass Function (IMF), and an exponential reddening prior
with scale values 06Av64. Stellar masses for galaxies in
the cluster ﬁeld are corrected for lensing magniﬁcation.
2.2. Star Formation Main Sequence
To place our sample of emission-line galaxies in context,
we show its star formation main sequence (SFMS) in Fig-
ure 2 with the ultraviolet (UV) + infrared (IR) SFMSs from
Whitaker et al. (2014) that overlap with the median redshifts
of our two samples. All H ﬂuxes are dust-corrected using
our integrated Balmer Decrement measurements on the in-
dividual galaxies (see Section 2.3). H ﬂuxes for galaxies4 M ATHARU ET AL .

in the cluster sample are corrected for magniﬁcation. We
calculate SFRs using the H ﬂux conversion from Kenni-
cutt (1998), adapting it from a Salpeter IMF to a Chabrier
(2003) IMF using the method in Muzzin et al. (2010). Both
the high and low redshift samples follow the SFMSs from
Whitaker et al. (2014) well, with the low and high redshift
samples having median offsets of -0:40:1and0:00:1dex
from the Whitaker et al. (2014) SFMSs respectively. Note
that at Log( M/M).8:5, we may be preferentially detecting
galaxies with higher speciﬁc star formation rates (sSFRs).
2.3. Integrated Balmer Decrements
In Figure 3, we show our integrated Balmer Decrements
as a function of stellar mass calculated using the integrated
H2and H ﬂuxes output by Grizli and compare them to
those measured using the MOSFIRE multi-object slit spectro-
graph as part of the MOSDEF survey (Shapley et al. 2022).
Despite differences in the instrument, type of spectroscopy
and extraction methods, our high and low redshift measure-
ments are consistent with those from MOSDEF within the 1
uncertainties of our measurements.

HSNR=73). However, the median H and H SNRs
for our sample are 22 and 7 respectively. Visual inspec-
tion of the H and H maps in Figure 1 however demon-
strate that dust can be clumpy and off-center. In this analysis
we decide to stack our galaxies both to maximize SNR and
average over all possible geometries for H and H spa-
tial distributions. Within each of our redshift bins, we
stack the H and H emission line maps of our galax-
ies in three bins of stellar mass: 7:66Log( M/M)<9:0,
9:06Log( M/M)<10:0and10:06Log( M/M)<11:1.
We use the inverse variance maps generated for each emis-
sion line map by Grizli to weight each pixel. Then we
add a further weighting by the total ﬂux density of the galaxy
in the corresponding direct imaging ﬁlter within which each
emission line is detected. This second weighting ensures no
single bright galaxy dominates the ﬁnal stack (Nelson et al.
2016a). The H and H maps for each stack are then added
together and corrected for exposure time by dividing by the
corresponding summed weight stack. For each stack, variance
maps are2

galaxy emission line map in the stack. In our low redshift bin,
Hand [O III] are close in wavelength such that [O III] is not
fully masked. We mask remaining [O III] emission by hand.
We then remove the effect of the point spread function (PSF)
from our stacks following a method that is similar to that of
Nelson et al. (2016b) but updated and modiﬁed for JWST .
Grizli is used in combination with WebbPSF (Perrin et al.
2012, 2014) to create empirical monochromatic PSFs at the
observed wavelengths of H and H for each galaxy in eachSPATIALLY RESOLVED DUST ATTENUATION WITH JWST NIRISS 5
Figure 4. Hand H stacks in bins of redshift and stellar mass.
We measure surface brightness proﬁles out to the dotted circles, the
largest of which has a radius of 3 kpc at the median redshift of the
stack. The number of galaxies in each H and H stellar mass stack
is shown in the bottom right corner of each H stack.
stack. These are created for multiple positions across the
NIRISS detector frame. A PSF at or near the location of
the galaxy on the detector is then drizzled with the same
parameters used for the emission line maps. The PSFs are then
stacked, leading to unique PSFs for each H and H stack.
GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002, 2010) is then used to ﬁt each stack
with a Sérsic model and then create a PSF-unconvolved model
based on parameters from the ﬁts (Szomoru et al. 2013).
Figure 4 shows the original PSF-convolved stacks zoomed
in to a 25 x 25 pixel square region (original emission line
map thumbnails are 80 x 80 pixels) with a pixel scale of
0:100. We measure the surface brightness proﬁles of the PSF-
unconvolved H and H stacks in ring apertures out to a
maxmimum of 3 kpc (largest dotted circles in Figure 4) us-ing the Python package MAGPIE3.MAGPIE accounts for the
surface area of each pixel included within each ring aperture
and allows the incorporation of our images to calculate the
errors for our surface brightness proﬁles. We then divide our
Hsurface brightness proﬁles by their corresponding H sur-
face brightness proﬁles to calculate radial Balmer Decrement
proﬁles shown in the top row of Figure 5. The dotted horizon-
tal lines show the expected H /Hratio of 2.86 for Case B
recombination and T= 104K (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006).
3.2. Radial Gradients in Dust Attenuation
We derive radial gradients in dust attenuation towards
Hby ﬁrst calculating the Balmer color excess,
E(H-H) = 2:5 log(H=H)
2:86
; (1)
where (H/H) is the measured Balmer Decrement. The
attenuation towards H is then:
AH=E(H-H)
k(H)-k(H)k(H); (2)
where k(H)andk(H)are the values of the adopted redden-
ing curve at the wavelengths of the H and H emission lines.
We show radial proﬁles of the absorption towards the H line
assuming a Calzetti et al. (2000) dust law in the bottom row
of Figure 5. The width ( 0:200) and length ( 0:500) of a typical
JWST NIRSpec shutter at z= 1:7are shown as the dark and
light grey shaded regions in Figure 5.
4.RESULTS & DISCUSSION
Regardless of redshift, emission-line galaxies with
Log(M=M)<9have centrally concentrated proﬁles within
1 kpc, reaching a maximum of AH= 1:030:04mag in
our high redshift sample within 0:4kpc from their center.
Emission-line galaxies with 9:06Log( M/M)<10:0regard-
less of redshift have negative dust attenuation proﬁles. The
high and low redshift samples reach maximums of 1:070:04
and0:790:03mag within 0:4kpc from their centers and are
consistent with no dust attenuation at 3 kpc. In our highest
mass bin, we measure ﬂat dust attenuation proﬁles for both
the high and low redshift samples. However, dust attenuation
is higher at all radii for our high redshift sample, with a maxi-
mum of 1:60:1mag more dust attenuation within 0:4kpc
at 1:76z<2:4 than at 1:06z<1:7.
We note that the two inner radial points for our low redshift
high mass Balmer Decrement proﬁle fall below the intrinsic
Balmer Decrement expected in the case of no dust attenuation.
These spurious measurements are likely due to contamination
subtraction issues, where there is under- or over-subtraction

in different locations, particularly hampering measurements
in regions of low SNR, as is also evident in the second ra-
dial points of Balmer Decrement proﬁles for the lowest mass
galaxies. High mass galaxies have the highest levels of dust
attenuation (see e.g. Figure 3) with low H SNRs and the low-
est mass galaxies have the lowest H ﬂuxes (e.g. Figure 2). A
combination of signiﬁcantly increasing our sample of galaxies
in these two stellar mass bins and actively improving our data
processing algorithms (see e.g. Matharu & Brammer 2022)
will improve such measurements in future work.
4.1. Literature Comparison
In the two panels on the bottom right of Figure 5, we show
results from previous works that have measured A Hin high
redshift galaxies assuming a Calzetti et al. (2000) dust law.
Nelson et al. (2016b) used HST WFC3 slitless spectroscopy
to measure spatially resolved Balmer Decrements at z1:4
in 3D-HST with clean H and H emission line maps and
F140W magnitude 624. Their results are shown as the lightblue dashed and dotted lines with error envelopes and overlap
in redshift with our low redshift sample (dark blue lines). For
the9:06Log( M/M)<10:0stellar mass bin, the median
stellar mass of our low redshift sample falls within the stel-
lar mass range of the 9:26Log( M/M)<9:8(see Figure 3)
z1:4dust attenuation proﬁle from Nelson et al. (2016b).
Our dust attenuation proﬁle is consistent with the Nelson et al.
(2016b) dust attenuation proﬁle within the 1uncertainties
of our measurements. In the higher mass bin, we do not mea-
sure a highly centrally concentrated negative dust attenuation
proﬁle like in Nelson et al. (2016b), but a ﬂat proﬁle that is
consistent with the Nelson et al. (2016b) proﬁle within 1of
our uncertainties at radii >2 kpc.
The brown dotted line with solid lines delineating the 1
scatter shows the A Hproﬁle inferred from the UV attenua-
tion proﬁle, A UV, for 10 massive star-forming main sequence
galaxies at z2from Tacchella et al. (2018). They recover
a moderately negative A Hproﬁle compared to our ﬂat pro-
ﬁle (red line). Our dust attenuation proﬁle is consistent withSPATIALLY RESOLVED DUST ATTENUATION WITH JWST NIRISS 7
the Tacchella et al. (2018) beyond 2 kpc within 1of our
uncertainties, but lies outside of their 1scatter below these
galactocentric radii.
The disagreement in our measurements at galactocentric
radii<2kpc with Nelson et al. (2016b) and Tacchella et al.
(2018) for our high mass bin could be due to the challenges
in data processing we discussed earlier in this section and
are actively working on. They could also be attributed to
the large variety of galaxy-to-galaxy dust attenuation proﬁles
measured in the literature (see e.g. Tacchella et al. 2018) and
our small sample size in this stellar mass bin being unable to
capture the true average proﬁle of the parent distribution. Our
methodology closely follows that of Nelson et al. (2016b), but
the comparison to these two works are not direct, since it can
be seen in Figure 5 that our stellar mass ranges do not match.
As larger samples of spatially resolved H and H emission
line maps become available from JWST NIRISS and NIRCam
slitless spectroscopy, we will be able to capture a larger variety
of Hemitting galaxies and provide a more complete picture
of spatially resolved dust attenuation towards H IIregions out
toz5.
4.2. How Dust Gradients effect SFR measurements from Slit
Spectroscopy
We test the effect of assuming uniform dust attenuation ver-
sus the dust attenuation proﬁles we measure, to SFR measure-
ments of typical star-forming galaxies at these redshifts and
stellar masses. We create PSF-convolved GALFIT models
for each of our redshift and stellar mass bins with the half-
light radii and Sérsic indices typical of star-forming galaxies
(Mowla et al. 2019) but with the brightnesses of our H stacks.
We then dust-correct our models using a single value of AH
calculated from the integrated Balmer Decrements in Fig-
ure 3 and with a 2D map of our AHradial proﬁles shown
in Figure 5. On average, we ﬁnd that assuming uniform
dust attenuation across the galaxy subsequent to slit loss cor-
rections will overestimate the SFRs of typical star-forming
galaxies by 621% and269%of the SFR calculated with
the radial dust attenuation corrections based on our proﬁles at
1:06z<1:7 and 1:76z<2:4 respectively.
In summary, our measurements indicate that:
1.Emission-line galaxies with 7:66Log( M/M)<10:0
have centrally concentrated, negative dust attenuation
proﬁles. At the lowest masses ( 7:66Log( M/M)<
9:0), maxmimum attenuations of AH= 0:930:05and1:030:04mag are reached at 1:06z<1:7and1:76
z<2:4within 0:4kpc from the center respectively. At
9:06Log( M/M)<10:0, these values are 0:790:03
and 1:070:04 mag respectively.
2.Emission-line galaxies with 10:06Log( M/M)<11:1
have ﬂat dust attenuation proﬁles with an average of
1:00:2mag more dust attenuation measured at 1:76
z<2:4 than at 1:06z<1:7.
3.Assuming uniform dust attenuation rather than the ra-
dial proﬁles we measure subsequent to (or during)
slit loss corrections will overestimate H SFR mea-
surements by an average of 621% and 269%
at1:06z<1:7and1:76z<2:4respectively (Sec-
tion 4.2).
