Abstract
Standard cosmological equations are written for the Hubble volume , while the real boundary of
space-time is the event horizon. Within the unimodular and thermody namic approaches to gravity, the
dark energy term in cosmological equations appears as an integrat ion constant, which we ﬁx at the event
horizon and obtain the observed value for the cosmological consta nt.

Numerous observations imply that the late universe is in acc elerated expansion [ 1,2]. Within the
framework of the standard cosmological model, an accelerat ed expansion can be accounted for by a positive
cosmological constant Λ, which presents in the system of equ ations for a homogeneous, isotropic and ﬂat
universe ( k= 0),
H2=8πG
3ρ+Λ

Here overdots denote derivatives with respect to the cosmic time,H≡˙a/ais the Hubble parameter, Gis
the gravitational constant, and ρandpare the mass and pressure densities of cosmological ﬂuids (w e use
the system of units where c=/planckover2pi1=kB= 1).
In (1) and (2) the cosmological constant Λ is a free parameter and is ﬁxed o nly from observations,
which for the value of dark energy density gives [ 3],
ΩΛ=Λ
3H2
0≈0.692, (3)
whereH0denotes the present value of the Hubble parameter. One of the main problems of standard
cosmology is that the measured value of Λ is much smaller than theoretical estimations obtained from the
standard quantum ﬁeld theory. In order to resolve this discr epancy, various models have been proposed
(see the reviews [ 4,5]).
It is known that, using the Friedmann equation ( 1), the acceleration equation ( 2) can be expressed
without Λ,
˙H=−4πG(ρ+p). (4)
Also, combining ( 1) and (2), one can obtain the matter energy-momentum conservation e quation,
˙ρ=−3H(ρ+p), (5)
1where the cosmological constant Λ does not appear as well. If instead of ( 1) and (2), one will choose ( 4)
and (5) as the independent system of cosmological equations, Λ obt ains the role of integration constant.
Indeed, excluding ( ρ+p) from (4) and (5),
4πG
3˙ρ=H˙H , (6)
and integrating this relation over the time, we obtain the Fr iedmann equation ( 1),
H2=8πG
3ρ+C , (7)
but with an integration constant Cinstead of Λ /3. So, in a cosmological models where the system ( 4) – (5)
is primary, and the Friedmann equation ( 1) represents its ﬁrst integral, the value of Λ can be obtained from
boundary conditions of the model. The examples of scenarios where Λ arises as an integration constant
are unimodular relativity [ 6–9] and thermodynamic approach to gravity [ 10–16].
Key ingredient in thermodynamic model of gravity is entropy , which allows us to study diﬀerent aspects
of various physical systems using a similar mathematical fr amework (see the recent review [ 17]). Most
thermodynamic cosmological scenarios are based on the holo graphic principle (see the review [ 18]) and for
an associated entropy of a volume usually is used the Bekenst ein–Hawking formula for black holes [ 19,20],
SBH=A
4G=πR2
G, (8)
whereRdenotes the radius and A= 4πR2is the surface area. In thermodynamic cosmology, to the Hubb le
sphere of radius

having the surface and volume

can be associated the temperature [ 21],
TH=H
2π, (11)
and the black hole type entropy ( 8),
SH=AH
4G=π
GH2>0. (12)
In thermodynamic approach, the Friedmann equation ( 7) has the natural interpretation as the balance of
gravitational and matter heat densities in the spirit of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics [ 15,16], while the
acceleration equation ( 4) can be obtained by equating the entropy input in the Hubble v olume to the sum
of entropy ﬂux(entropy received per unit surface) transfer red through the horizon and the entropy supplied
by internal sources (entropy generated per unit volume). In deed, if we neglect the entropy supplied by
internal sources, the time derivative of the entropy contai ned within the Hubble volume, SH, should be
equal to the ﬂux of the matter entropy density, Sm, through the boundary AH,
˙SH=SmAH. (13)
Using the classical Gibbs–Duhem relation,
ρ+p=THSm, (14)
the equation ( 13) takes the form:
˙AH= 4G(ρ+p)AH
TH, (15)
2which, using ( 10) and (11), reduces to the standard acceleration equation ( 4). Note that in thermodynamic
picture the Universe cannot export the entropy to any extern al universes and it seems that its total entropy
is conserved [ 22–25].
Thus, in various scenarios, the Friedmann equation ( 7) contains the integration constant C(the dark
energy term). This change of the role of Λ from a parameter of t he matter action to a property of states
does not solve the cosmological constant problem, but it doe s change it from a question of ﬁne-tuning to
a question of boundary conditions [ 26,27]. To ﬁnd proper boundary conditions, note that cosmologica l
equations are written for the Hubble volume, since as a prope r causal boundary of the classical space-time
(for the ﬂat universe, k= 0) usually the Hubble horizon is considered [ 28,29]. Then the metric ﬂuctuations
are bounded by RHand thermodynamic laws also are satisﬁed on this boundary [ 30,31].
On the other hand, the quantum ﬂuctuations of matter ﬁelds sh ould be limited not by the Hubble
horizonRH, but by the event horizon Re≥RH, which represents a real boundary of space-time [ 32,33].
Then, cosmological equations should also contain the energ y density corresponding to entanglements of
quantum particles across the Hubble horizon [ 34] and can be taken into account by introducing a surface
term atRH. It was found that the perfect ﬂuid of entanglement has a nega tive pressure [ 35] and can be
interpreted as the origin of dark energy [ 13].
The value of the event horizon at the current cosmic time can b e estimated as (see, for example, [ 36]):
Re=1
H0/integraldisplay0
−1dy/radicalbig
Ωm(1+y)3+ΩΛ≈0.96RH√ΩΛ, (16)
where Ω mdenotes the matter density. While particle entanglements c an be eﬀective up to Re, in the
context of cosmology (as well as in the context of black holes ), (16) is always deﬁned globally (see more
discussions in [ 37]) and at the event horizon we can assume absence of matter,
Ωm|R→Re→0. (17)
Using this assumption, we can ﬁx the integration constant in (7):
C=H2|R→Re=1
R2e. (18)
Therefore, for the dark energy density we obtain the value
C
H2
0=R2
H
R2e≈1.08ΩΛ, (19)
which almost coincides with the observed density of the dark energy (3), within the uncertainties in
measurements of Ω mand ΩΛin (16).
To summarize, in this paper we have noted that within the unim odular or thermodynamic approaches
to gravity, in the Friedmann equation ( 7) the cosmological term appears as an integration constant, i.e.
is not associated with the large vacuum expectation values a nd can be ﬁxed from boundary conditions.
Since the real boundary of space-time is the event horizon an d not the Hubble sphere, we assume that
cosmological equations should contain the terms correspon ding to the entanglements of quantum particles
across the apparent horizon. Using the fact that in a region e nclosed by an event horizon, like a black hole,
interior matter density should tend to zero at the horizon ( 17), in the Friedmann equation ( 7) we ﬁx the
integration constant ( 18) and obtain the value for the dark energy density ( 19) that almost coincides with
the observations ( 3).
