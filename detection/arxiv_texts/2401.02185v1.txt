Abstract
Let Ω nbe a ﬁnite chain with nelements ( n∈N), and let POPI nbe the semigroup of all injective
orientation-preserving partial transformations of Ω n. In this paper, for any nonempty subset Yof Ωn, we
consider the subsemigroup POPI n(Y) ofPOPI nof all transformations with range contained in Y. We
describe the Green’s relations and study the regularity of POPI n(Y). Moreover, we calculate the rank of
POPI n(Y) and determine when two semigroups of this type are isomorphic.

Introduction and preliminaries
Let Ωn={1,2,...,n}be ann-element set ordered in the standard way. We denote by PTnthe monoid (under
composition) of all partial transformations on Ω n, byTnthe submonoid of PTnof all full transformations on
Ωn, byInthesymmetric inverse monoid on Ωn, i.e. the inverse submonoid of PTnof all partial permutations
on Ωn, and by Snthesymmetric group on Ωn, i.e. the subgroup of PTnof all permutations on Ω n.
A transformation αinPTnis called order-preserving ifx/lessorequalslantyimpliesxα/lessorequalslantyα, for allx,y∈Dom(α). We
denote by Onthe submonoid of Tnof all order-preserving full transformations and by POInthe submonoid of
Inof all order-preserving partial permutations.
Lets= (a1,a2,...,at) be a sequence of t(t/greaterorequalslant0) elements from the chain Ω n. We say that siscyclicif
there exists no more than one index i∈ {1,...,t}such that ai> ai+1, whereat+1denotesa1. Notice that,
the sequence sis cyclic if and only if sis empty or there exists i∈ {0,1,...,t−1}such that ai+1/lessorequalslantai+2/lessorequalslant
···/lessorequalslantat/lessorequalslanta1/lessorequalslant···/lessorequalslantai(the index i∈ {0,1,...,t−1}is unique unless sis constant and t/greaterorequalslant2). Given a
partial transformation α∈ PTnsuch that Dom( α) ={a1<···< at}, witht/greaterorequalslant0, we say that αisorientation-
preserving if the sequence of its images ( a1α,...,a tα) is cyclic. We denote by OPnandPOPI nthe submonoids
ofTnandInof all orientation-preserving transformations, respecti vely.
As usual, the rankof a ﬁnite semigroup Sis deﬁned by rank( S) = min{|A| |A⊆S,/a\}bracketle{tA/a\}bracketri}ht=S}.It is well
known that, for n/greaterorequalslant3, the ranks of PTn,Tn,InandSnare equal to 4, 3, 3 and 2, respectively. Gomes and
Howie [11] showed that the rank of the monoid Onis equal to n. Catarino [2] established the rank of the monoid
OPn, and in [1], Catarino and Higgins proved that OPnis a regular submonoid of Tn. In [7], Fernandes et al.
described the congruences on OPnand, in [6], Fernandes showed that the rank of the monoid POInis equal
tonand established a presentation for this monoid. The classiﬁ cation of maximal subsemigroups of POInwas
obtained by Ganyushkin and Mazorchuk [12]. In [5], Fernande s proved that the rank of POPI nis equal to 2,
described the congruences and gave a presentation for this m onoid.

1Given a nonempty subset Yof Ωn, let
Tn(Y) ={α∈ Tn|Im(α)⊆Y},
PTn(Y) ={α∈ PTn|Im(α)⊆Y},
In(Y) ={α∈ In|Im(α)⊆Y},
On(Y) ={α∈ On|Im(α)⊆Y},
OPn(Y) ={α∈ OPn|Im(α)⊆Y},
POIn(Y) ={α∈ POI n|Im(α)⊆Y}.
In 1975, Symons [20] introduced and studied the semigroup Tn(Y). He described all the automorphisms
ofTn(Y) and also determined when two semigroups of this type are iso morphic. In [17], Nenthein et al.
characterized the regular elements of Tn(Y) and, in [18], Sanwong and Sommanee obtained the largest reg ular
subsemigroup of Tn(Y) and they also determined a class of maximal inverse subsemi groups of this semigroup.
Later, in 2009, all maximal and minimal congruences on Tn(Y) were described by Sanwong et al. [19]. On
the other hand, Sullivan [21] consider the linear counterpa rt ofTn(Y), that is the semigroup which consists
of all linear transformations from a vector space Vinto a ﬁxed subspace WofV, and described its Green’s
relations and ideals. The rank of the semigroups Tn(Y),PTn(Y) andIn(Y) were considered by Fernandes and
Sanwong in [10]. A description of the regular elements of On(Y) was given by Mora and Kemprasit in [16].
This semigroup was also studied by Fernandes et al. in [8] who described its largest regular subsemigroup and
Green’s relations. Moreover, also in [8], Fernandes et al. d etermined when two semigroups of the type On(Y)
are isomorphic and calculated their ranks. Fernandes et al. [9] describe the largest regular subsemigroup of the
semigroup OPn(Y), they also determine when two semigroups of type OPn(Y) are isomorphic and calculated
the rank of the semigroup OPn(Y). Recently, in [15], Li et al. considered the rank propertie s of the semigroup
POIn(Y) and they also determined when two semigroups of the type POIn(Y) are isomorphic. For more
results about semigroups of transformations with restrict ed range, for example, see [3,4,22,23].
In this paper, for each nonempty subset Yof Ωn, we consider the semigroup of transformations with
restricted range
POPI n(Y) ={α∈ POPI n|Im(α)⊆Y}.
This paper is organized as follows. Some preliminary knowle dge and notation are given at the end of this
section. Section 1 is dedicated to the study of regularity an d Green’s relations on POPI n(Y). In Section 2, we
determine the cardinality of the semigroup POPI n(Y) and when two semigroups of the type POPI n(Y) are
isomorphic. In Section 3, we investigate the rank of POPI n(Y).
Throughout this paper, Ywill always denote a nonempty subset of Ω n.
LetSbe a semigroup. Denote by S1the monoid obtained from Sthrough the adjoining of an identity

H=L∩RandD=L∨R=L◦R=R◦L. It is well known that D=Jin a ﬁnite semigroup.
ForK∈ {L,R,J,H,D}anda∈S, we denote the K-class containing abyKa. If necessary, to avoid
ambiguity, we also denote the Green’s equivalence Kand the K-class containing aon the semigroup SbyKS
and by KS
a, respectively.
An element aofSis called regularif there exists binSsuch that aba=a. The semigroup Sis said to be
regularif all its elements are regular.

21 Regularity and Green’s relations
In this section, we characterize the regular elements of POPI n(Y) and Green’s relations on POPI n(Y). In
addition, we determine when POPI n(Y) is a regular semigroup.
Letα∈ PTn. We denote by Dom( α) and Im( α) thedomainandimageofα, respectively. Deﬁne also
rank(α) =|Im(α)|.
Proposition 1.1. Letα∈ POPI n(Y). Then, the following are equivalent:
(i)αis regular;
(ii)Im(α) =Yα;
(iii)Dom(α)⊆Y.
Proof.(i)⇒(ii) Suppose that α∈ POPI n(Y) is regular. Then, there exists some β∈ POPI n(Y) such that
α=αβα, and so Im( α) = Ωnα= (Ωnαβ)α⊆Yα⊆Ωnα= Im(α). Hence, Im( α) =Yα.
(ii)⇒(iii) Since Im( α) =Yαandαis injective, it follows that Dom( α)⊆Y.
(iii)⇒(i) Supposethat Dom( α)⊆Y. If Dom( α) =∅, thenα=∅andsoit is clearly regular. IfDom( α)/\e}atio\slash=∅,
then Im( α)/\e}atio\slash=∅. Let Im( α) ={z1<···< zm} ⊆Y. Then, there exist y1,...,ym∈Ysuch that yiα=zifor
1/lessorequalslanti/lessorequalslantm, and the sequence ( y1,y2,...,ym) is cyclic. Let β= (z1z2···zmy1y2···ym).Clearly,β∈ POPI n(Y). Then, it
is routine to verify that α=αβα, whence αis regular.
The next result determines when POPI n(Y) is a regular semigroup.
Corollary 1.2. LetYbe a nonempty subset of Ωn. Then,POPI n(Y)is regular if and only if Y= Ωn.
Proof.IfY= Ωn, then for any α∈ POPI n(Y), Dom(α)⊆Y. It follows from Proposition 1.1 that αis regular,
whence, POPI n(Y) is regular (notice that, in [5], it was already proved that POPI nis regular). If Y/\e}atio\slash= Ωn,
then there exist elements x∈Ωn\Yandy∈Y. Clearly, α= (xy)∈ POPI n(Y) and Dom( α)/notsubseteqlY, whence αis
not regular in POPI n(Y), by Proposition 1.1. Thus, POPI n(Y) is not regular.
Recall the following result from [5]:
Lemma 1.3. [5, Propositions 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6] Let α,β∈ POPI n. Then:
(i)(α,β)∈Lif and only if Im(α) = Im(β);
(ii)(α,β)∈Rif and only if Dom(α) = Dom( β);
(iii) Let α∈ POPI nbe such that 1≤rank(α) =m/lessorequalslantn. Then,|Hα|=m. Moreover, if αis an idempotent,
thenHαis a cyclic group of order m;
(iv)(α,β)∈Dif and only if rank(α) = rank( β).
The following theorem describes the Green’s relations L,RandHonPOPI n(Y). Let us denote the
partial identity transformation on a subset Aof Ωnby idA. Clearly, if A⊆Y, then id A∈ POPI n(Y)
Theorem 1.4. Letα,β∈ POPI n(Y). Then
(i)(α,β)∈Lif and only if either both αandβare regular and Im(α) = Im(β), orα=β.
(ii)(α,β)∈Rif and only if Dom(α) = Dom( β).
(iii) Let α∈ POPI n(Y)be such that rank(α) =m. Ifαis not regular, then |Hα|= 1. Ifαis regular, then
|Hα|=mand all the elements of Hαhave the same domain and image. Moreover, if αis an idempotent,
thenHαis a cyclic group of order m.
3Proof.(i) Suppose that ( α,β)∈LPOPI n(Y). Then, there exist γ,δ∈ POPI n(Y)1such that α=γβand
β=δα. Suppose that αis regular. If γ= 1 orδ= 1, then α=β, and so both αandβare regular and
Im(α) = Im(β); ifγ,δ/\e}atio\slash= 1, then Ω nα= Ωnγβ⊆Yβ⊆Ωnβ= Ωnδα⊆Yα⊆Ωnαand so Im( α) = Ωnα=
Yα=Yβ= Ωnβ= Im(β). Hence, both αandβare regular and Im( α) = Im(β). Suppose that αis not regular.
Ifγ,δ/\e}atio\slash= 1, then Ω nα= Ωnγβ= Ωnγδα⊆Yα⊆Ωnαand so Im( α) = Ωnα=Yα. Hence, αis regular by
Theorem 1.1, a contradiction. Hence, γ= 1 orδ= 1, and so α=β.
Conversely, if α=β, then trivially ( α,β)∈LPOPI n(Y). So, suppose that αandβare regular and
Im(α) = Im(β). Then, in particular, ( α,β)∈LPOPI n, by Lemma 1.3(i). Let γ,δ∈ POPI nbe such that
α=γβandβ=δα. Letα′,β′∈ POPI n(Y) be such that α=αα′αandβ=ββ′β. Thenα=γβ=γββ′β
and, clearly, γββ′∈ POPI n(Y). Similarly, β=δαα′αandδαα′∈ POPI n(Y). Thus, ( α,β)∈LPOPI n(Y).
(ii) If (α,β)∈RPOPI n(Y), then (α,β)∈RPOPI n, and so so Dom( α) = Dom( β), by Lemma 1.3(ii).
Conversely, suppose that Dom( α) = Dom( β). Then, ( α,β)∈RPOPI n, by Lemma 1.3(ii). Hence, α=βγ
andβ=αδfor some γ,δ∈ POPI n. Clearly, α=αidIm(α)andβ=βidIm(β), whence α=βγidIm(α)and
β=αδidIm(β). Since, clearly, γidIm(α),δidIm(β)∈ POPI n(Y), we get ( α,β)∈RPOPI n(Y).
(iii) Let α∈ POPI n(Y) be such that rank( α) =m. Ifαis not regular, then by (i) we have |Lα|= 1,
and so|Hα|= 1. Therefore, suppose that αis regular. Then, for any γ∈HPOPI nα, by Proposition 1.1
and Lemma 1.3, we have Dom( γ) = Dom( α)⊆Yand Im(γ) = Im(α)⊆Y. Hence, γ∈ POPI n(Y) and
γ∈HPOPI n(Y)
α , by (i) and (ii). So HPOPI nα⊆HPOPI n(Y)
α and, as trivially HPOPI n(Y)
α ⊆HPOPI nα, we get
HPOPI n(Y)
α =HPOPI nα. Thus, by Lemma 1.3(iii), |HPOPI n(Y)
α |=m, all the elements of HPOPI n(Y)
α have
the same domain and image, and if αis an idempotent, then HPOPI n(Y)
α is a cyclic group of order m.
Our next theorem gives a characterization of the Green’s rel ation D=JonPOPI n(Y).
Theorem 1.5. Letα,β∈ POPI n(Y). Then,(α,β)∈Dif and only if either (1) both αandβare regular and
rank(α) = rank( β)or (2) both αandβare not regular and Dom(α) = Dom( β).
Proof.Supposethat ( α,β)∈DPOPI n(Y). Then, ( α,β)∈DPOPI n, and so, by Lemma 1.3(iv), we get rank( α) =
rank(β). Since any two D-related elements (in any semigroup) are both regular or bot h not regular, then either
bothαandβare regular or both αandβare not regular. If both αandβare regular, then we have (1). So,
suppose that both αandβare not regular and let γ∈ POPI n(Y) be such that ( α,γ)∈Land (γ,β)∈R.
Hence, by Theorem 1.4, it follows that α=γand Dom( γ) = Dom( β). Thus, Dom( α) = Dom( β).
Conversely, if both αandβare not regular and Dom( α) = Dom( β), then ( α,β)∈RPOPI n(Y), by
Theorem 1.4(ii), and so ( α,β)∈DPOPI n(Y). On the other hand, suppose both αandβare regular and
rank(α) = rank( β). Then, ( α,β)∈DPOPI n, by Lemma1.3(iv). Let γ∈ POPI nbesuch that ( α,γ)∈LPOPI n
and (γ,β)∈RPOPI n. Hence, by Lemma 1.3(i), Im( γ) = Im(α) and so γ∈ POPI n(Y). On the other hand,
by Lemma 1.3(ii), Dom( γ) = Dom( β), and so, by Theorem 1.4, ( γ,β)∈RPOPI n(Y). Thus, as βis regular, γ
must be regular too, and so we have that both αandγare regular with Im( γ) = Im(α), from which follows,
by Theorem 1.4, that ( α,γ)∈LPOPI n(Y). Therefore, ( α,β)∈DPOPI n(Y), as required.
2 Size and an isomorphism theorem
LetYbe a subset of Ω nof sizer, with 1/lessorequalslantr/lessorequalslantn. In this section, the cardinality of the semigroup POPI n(Y)
is determined, and an isomorphism theorem for semigroup of t he typePOPI n(Y) is given.
Notice that, as the elements of the semigroup POPI n(Y) are injective orientation-preserving partial trans-
formations, for any nonempty sets A⊆ΩnandB⊆Ywith|A|=|B|, clearly, we have
|{α∈ POPI n(Y)|Dom(α) =A,Im(α) =B}|=|B|.
LetJk={α∈ POPI n(Y)|rank(α) =k}for 1/lessorequalslantk/lessorequalslantr. Since the numbers of distinct domains contained
in Ωnof sizekand distinct images contained in Yof sizekare/parenleftbign

and/parenleftbigr
k/parenrightbig
, respectively, it follows that
4|Jk|=k/parenleftbign
k/parenrightbig/parenleftbigr
k/parenrightbig
. AsPOPI n(Y) also contains the empty transformation, we obtain
|POPI n(Y)|= 1+r/summationdisplay
k=1|Jk|= 1+r/summationdisplay
k=1k/parenleftbign
k/parenrightbig/parenleftbigr
k/parenrightbig
.
Now, considering the Combinatorial Identity (3.30) in [13, p.25], i.e.
r/summationdisplay
k=1k/parenleftbigr
k/parenrightbig/parenleftbign
k/parenrightbig
=r/parenleftbign+r−1
r/parenrightbig
,
we conclude the following result.
Proposition 2.1. The cardinality of POPI n(Y)is equal to 1+r/parenleftbign+r−1
r/parenrightbig
.
Let us denote by E(S) the set of idempotents of a semigroup S.
For anyα∈ PTn, denote the set of ﬁxed points of αby Fix(α), i.e. Fix( α) ={x∈Dom(α)|xα=x}.
Lemma 2.2. LetYandZbe nonempty subsets of Ωn. LetΦ :POPI n(Y)−→ POPI n(Z)be an isomorphism.
Then,Φinduces a bijection ϕ:Y−→Zsuch that:
(i)id{y}Φ = id {yϕ}for anyy∈Y;
(ii) for any α∈ POPI n(Y), ify∈Y∩Dom(α), thenyϕ∈Dom(αΦ)and(yϕ)(αΦ) = (yα)ϕ;
(iii) for any α∈ POPI n(Y),Fix(αΦ) = Fix( α)ϕ;
(iv) for any α∈ POPI n(Y),Im(αΦ) = Im( α)ϕ.
Proof.(i) The empty transformation ∅is the zero of the semigroups POPI n(Y) andPOPI n(Z). Since Φ is
an isomorphism, we have ∅Φ =∅. For any y∈Y, since id {y}is an idempotent, it follows that id {y}Φ is an
idempotent, and so id {y}Φ = id Zyfor some nonempty subset ZyofZ. Clearly, id {y1}id{y2}=∅for any distinct
y1, y2∈Y, and so, it follows from id Zy1∩Zy2= idZy1idZy2= (id{y1}Φ)(id{y2}Φ) = (id {y1}id{y2})Φ =∅Φ =∅
thatZy1∩Zy2=∅. Therefore, |Y|/lessorequalslant/summationtext
y∈Y|Zy|/lessorequalslant|Z|. Since Φ−1is an isomorphism from POPI n(Z) to
POPI n(Y), a similar argument can show that |Z|/lessorequalslant|Y|, whence |Y|=/summationtext
y∈Y|Zy|=|Z|, and so Zyis a
singleton for each y∈Y, sayZy={zy}. Moreover, the mapping ϕ:Y−→Zdeﬁned by yϕ=zy, for each
y∈Y, is clearly a bijection.
(ii) Letα∈ POPI n(Y) and take y∈Y∩Dom(α). Then,
id{(yα)ϕ}= id{yα}Φ = ((yα
y)(y
yα))Φ = ((yα
y)id{y}α)Φ = ((yα
y)Φ)id{yϕ}(αΦ) = ((yα
y)Φ)/parenleftBigyϕ
(yϕ)(αΦ)/parenrightBig
,
whence{(yα)ϕ}= Im(id {(yα)ϕ})⊆ {(yϕ)(αΦ)}. Consequently, ( yα)ϕ= (yϕ)(αΦ).
(iii) Let α∈ POPI n(Y). Ify∈Fix(α), theny∈Y∩Dom(α), and so by (ii), ( yϕ)(αΦ) = (yα)ϕ=yϕ.
Hence,yϕ∈Fix(αΦ) and so Fix( α)ϕ⊆Fix(αΦ). Since ϕis injective, it follows that |Fix(α)|=|Fix(α)ϕ|/lessorequalslant
|Fix(αΦ)|. Similarly, as Φ−1is an isomorphism from POPI n(Z) toPOPI n(Y), we have |Fix(αΦ)|/lessorequalslant
|Fix((αΦ)Φ−1|=|Fix(α)|, whence |Fix(α)ϕ|=|Fix(αΦ)|, and so Fix( α)ϕ= Fix(αΦ).
(iv) First, notice that if α∈E(POPI n(Y)), then αΦ∈E(POPI n(Z)), whence Im( α) = Fix( α) and
Im(αΦ) = Fix( αΦ). Thus, from (iii), it follows that Im( αΦ) = Im( α)ϕ.
Now, let αbe any element of POPI n(Y). Then, clearly, α−1α∈E(POPI n(Y)) andαΦ = (α(α−1α))Φ =
αΦ(α−1α)Φ, whence Im( αΦ)⊆Im((α−1α)Φ). On the other hand, we also have ( αΦ)−1(αΦ)∈E(POPI n(Z)).
Therefore, there exists β∈E(POPI n(Y)) such that βΦ = (αΦ)−1(αΦ). Since ( αβ)Φ = (αΦ)(βΦ) =
αΦ((αΦ)−1(αΦ)) =αΦ, it follows that αβ=α, whence Im( α)⊆Im(β) and so (Im( α))ϕ⊆(Im(β))ϕ. Thus,
Im(αΦ)⊆Im((α−1α)Φ) = (Im( α−1α))ϕ= (Im(α))ϕ⊆(Im(β))ϕ= Im(βΦ) = Im(( αΦ)−1(αΦ))⊆Im(αΦ),
from which follows that Im( αΦ) = Im( α)ϕ.
5Let us consider the following two permutations of Ω nof order nand 2, respectively:
g=/parenleftbigg1 2···n−1n
2 3···n1/parenrightbigg
andh=/parenleftbigg1 2 ···n−1n
n n−1···2 1/parenrightbigg
. (2.1)
Then, for n/greaterorequalslant3,gandhgenerate the well-known dihedral group D2nof order 2 n(considered as a subgroup of
the symmetric group Sn). In fact, we have
D2n=/a\}bracketle{tg,h|gn=h2= 1,gh=hgn−1/a\}bracketri}ht={1,g,g2,...,gn−1,h,hg,hg2,...,hgn−1}.
Observe that, for n∈ {1,2}, the dihedral group D2n=/a\}bracketle{tg,h|gn=h2= 1,gh=hgn−1/a\}bracketri}htof order 2 n(also
known as the Klein four-group forn= 2) cannot be considered as a subgroup of Sn.
Next, recall the following result from [9]:
Lemma 2.3. [9, Propositions 1.1] A partial injective transformation αis a restriction of a permutation in D2n
if and only if |jα−iα| ∈ {j−i,n−(j−i)}, for alli,j∈Dom(α)such that i < j.
Now, we can prove the following isomorphism theorem.
Theorem 2.4. LetYandZbe nonempty subsets of Ωn. Then, the semigroups POPI n(Y)andPOPI n(Z)
are isomorphic if and only if |Y|=|Z|/lessorequalslant2orYδ=Zfor some δ∈ D2n.
Proof.IfYδ=Zfor some δ∈ D2n, then it is routine to verify that the mappingΦ: POPI n(Y)−→ POPI n(Z)
deﬁned by αΦ =δ−1αδ, for allα∈ POPI n(Y), is an isomorphism. On the other hand, suppose that |Y|=
|Z|/lessorequalslant2 and let σ∈ Snbe such that Yσ=Z. Since any transformation of Inwith rank less than or equal to 2
is orientation-preserving, we have σ−1POPI n(Y)σ⊆ POPI n(Z) and so, as above, it is easy to check that the
mapping Φ: POPI n(Y)−→ POPI n(Z) deﬁned by αΦ =σ−1ασfor allα∈ POPI n(Y) is an isomorphism.
Conversely, suppose that Φ : POPI n(Y)−→ POPI n(Z) is an isomorphism and let ϕ:Y−→Zbe the
bijection induced by Φ given by Lemma 2.2. Then, |Y|=|Z|. Hence, suppose that |Y|=|Z|/greaterorequalslant3.
Leti,j∈Ybe such that i < jand take k∈Y\{i,j}. Deﬁne
A(i,j,k) =/braceleftbigg/parenleftbiggi j y
i j k/parenrightbigg
∈ POPI n(Y)|y∈Ωn/bracerightbigg
.
Then, it is easy to verify that A(i,j,k) =/braceleftBig/parenleftBig
i j y
i j k/parenrightBig
|y∈ {1,...,i−1,j+1,...,n}/bracerightBig
,ifi < j < k ork < i < j ,
andA(i,j,k) =/braceleftBig/parenleftBig
i j y
i j k/parenrightBig
|y∈ {i+1,...,j−1}/bracerightBig
,ifi < k < j . Thus,|A(i,j,k)| ∈ {n−(j−i)−1,j−i−1}.
On the other hand, by Lemma 2.2 (ii) and (iv), we have
A(i,j,k)Φ =/braceleftbigg/parenleftbiggiϕ jϕ z
iϕ jϕ kϕ/parenrightbigg
∈ POPI n(Z)|z∈Ωn/bracerightbigg
and so, similarly, |A(i,j,k)Φ| ∈ {n−|jϕ−iϕ|−1,|jϕ−iϕ|−1}. Therefore, |jϕ−iϕ| ∈ {j−i,n−(j−i)}.
Now, by Lemma 2.3, it follows that ϕis a restriction of some permutation δinD2n, for which we have
Yδ=Z, as required.
3 Rank of POPI n(Y)
In this section, we determine the rank of the semigroup POPI n(Y). Notice that, POPI n(Ωn) =POPI nand
it is well known that the semigroup POPI nhas rank 2 (see [5]). Therefore, in what follows, we suppose t hat
Y={y1< y2<···< yr}is a proper subset of Ω n.
LetJS
m={α∈S|rank(α) =m}, for any subsemigroup SofPTnand 0/lessorequalslantm/lessorequalslantn.
We begin by recalling the following lemma.

Next, observe that the permutation gof Ωndeﬁned in (2.1) is an orientation-preserving transformati on.
We will now prove a series of lemmas.
Lemma 3.2. For0/lessorequalslantm/lessorequalslantr−2,JPOPI n(Y)

ℓ∈ {0,1,···,n−1}suchthat α=gℓα1, wheregisthepermutationdeﬁnedin(2.1). Then,Im( α1) = Im(α)⊆Y,
and soα1∈ POI n(Y). By Lemma 3.1, there exist β,γ∈ POI n(Y) with rank m+1 such that α1=βγ. Let
δ=gℓβ. Then, Im( δ) = Im(β)⊆Y, andsoδ∈ POPI n(Y)withrank( δ) =m+1. Thus, α=δγ∈ /a\}bracketle{tJPOPI n(Y)

as required.
LetV={α∈ POI n(Y)|Dom(α)⊆Yand rank( α) =r−1}. Obviouly, we also have V⊆ POPI n(Y).
Lemma 3.3. JPOPI n(Y)

Proof.Letα∈JPOPI n(Y)
r−1. By [5, Proposition 3.1], there exist α1∈ POI nandℓ∈ {0,1,···,n−1}such that
α=gℓα1. Then, Im( α1) = Im(α)⊆Y, asgis a permutation of Ω n, whence α1∈JPOIn(Y)
r−1. Assume that
α1=/parenleftbigga1···ai−1aiai+1···ar−1
y1···yi−1yi+1yi+2···yr/parenrightbigg
,
with Im( α) =Y\{yi}for some 1 /lessorequalslanti/lessorequalslantr. Since rank( α) =r−1< n, then there exist c∈Ωn\{a1,...,a r−1}
and 1/lessorequalslantj/lessorequalslantrsuch that aj−1< c < a j, wherea0= 0 and ar=n+1. Let
β=/parenleftbigga1···ai−1ai···aj−1c aj···ar−1

and
γ=/parenleftbiggy1···yj−1yj+1···yiyi+1···yr
y1···yj−1yj···yi−1yi+1···yr/parenrightbigg
,
ifi > j. Then, it is a routine matter to verify that β∈JPOPI n(Y)
r ,γ∈Vandα1=βγ. Hence, α=gℓβγ.
Sincegℓβ∈JPOPI n(Y)
r , we have α∈ /a\}bracketle{tJPOPI n(Y)
r ∪V/a\}bracketri}ht, as required.
Lemma 3.4. V⊆ /a\}bracketle{tJPOPI n(Y)
r /a\}bracketri}ht.
Proof.Letα∈Vand suppose that Dom( α) =Y\{yi}and Im(α) =Y\{yj}, for some 1 /lessorequalslanti,j/lessorequalslantr. Clearly, if
i/greaterorequalslantj, then
α=/parenleftbiggy1···yj−1yj···yi−1yi+1···yr

ifi < j, then
α=/parenleftbiggy1···yi−1yi+1···yjyj+1···yr

Now, we distinguish three major cases.

In all cases, it is a routine matter to verify that β,γ∈JPOPI n(Y)
r andα=βγ. Therefore, α∈ /a\}bracketle{tJPOPI n(Y)
r /a\}bracketri}ht,
as required.
From Lemmas 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, it follows that POPI n(Y) can be generated by its elements of rank r, i.e.
the following result holds.
Lemma 3.5. POPI n(Y) =/a\}bracketle{tJPOPI n(Y)
r /a\}bracketri}ht.
Now, let
¯g=/parenleftbiggy1y2···yr−1yr
y2y3···yry1/parenrightbigg
∈ POPI n(Y).
Then, we have the following result.
Lemma 3.6. Letα,β∈ POPI n(Y)be such that rank(α) = rank( β) =randDom(α) = Dom( β). Then,
α=β¯gtfor some 0/lessorequalslantt/lessorequalslantr−1.
Proof.Assume that Dom( α) = Dom( β) ={a1< a2<···< ar}. Then,
α=/parenleftbigga1a2···ai−1aiai+1···ar
yr−i+2yr−i+3···yry1y2···yr−i+1/parenrightbigg
and
β=/parenleftbigga1a2···aj−1ajaj+1···ar
yr−j+2yr−j+3···yry1y2···yr−j+1/parenrightbigg
for some 1 /lessorequalslanti,j/lessorequalslantr. Let
t=/braceleftBigg
j−iifi/lessorequalslantj,
r−i+jifi > j.
So, it is routine to show that α=β¯gt, as required.
9Lemma 3.7. Letα,β∈ POPI n(Y)be two elements of rank rsuch that rank(αβ) =r. Then,(αβ,α)∈R.
Proof.Since Dom( αβ)⊆Dom(α) and rank( α) = rank( αβ), it follows that Dom( αβ) = Dom( α), whence
(αβ,α)∈R, by Theorem 1.4(ii).
An immediate consequence of Lemmas 3.6 and 3.7 is that any gen erating set of the semigroup POPI n(Y)
must contain at least one element from each R-class of rank rofPOPI n(Y), andPOPI n(Y) can be generated
by any set containing ¯ gas well as at least one element from each R-class of rank rofPOPI n(Y). On the other
hand, the number of R-class of rank rofPOPI n(Y) is/parenleftbign
r/parenrightbig
. Thus, we can now present the main result of this
section as follows.
Theorem 3.8. LetYbe a nonempty subset of Ωnof sizer. Then
rank(POPI n(Y)) =/braceleftBigg/parenleftbign
r/parenrightbig
if1/lessorequalslant|Y|/lessorequalslantn−1,
2if|Y|=n.
