Abstract
We introduce and study a family of axioms that closely follow s the pattern of parametrized
diamonds, studied by Moore, Hrušák, and Džamonja in [ 13]. However, our approach ap-
peals to model theoretic / forcing theoretic notions, rathe r than pure combinatorics. The
main goal of the paper is to exhibit a surprising, close conne ction between seemingly
very distinct principles. As an application, we show that fo rcing with a measure algebra
preserves (a variant of) ♦(d), improving an old result of M. Hrušák.

0 Introduction
The aim of this paper is to introduce an alternative approach to parametrized diamond prin-
ciples. These axioms are sufﬁcient to construct numerous co mbinatorial objects, whose exis-
tence was originally known to follow from ♦. A common catchphrase is that parameterized
diamonds measure a "degree" of ♦in a similar manner as cardinal invariants of the real line
measure "how much" of CH is true.
The ﬁrst axiom in this spirit, the weak diamond , was studied by Devlin and Shelah in [ 4],
and turned out to be equivalent to a cardinal arithmetic stat ement2ω<2ω1. Much later, a
similar axiom ♦dwas introduced in [ 9] in order to partially answer the question whether d=
ω1impliesa=ω1. These two examples served as a ground for developing a more g eneral
theory in [ 13]. These axioms, the parametrized diamonds , have found numerous applications,
for example: ♦(b)gives an maximal almost disjoint family of size ω1,♦(non(M))implies
there is a Suslin tree, and ♦(r)gives aω1-generated ultraﬁlter on ω([13]). Different variants
of parametrized diamonds were also applied in, for example, [6] and [ 3] in connection with
combinatorics of [ω]ω, and in [ 14], [8], [2] for topological constructions. A certain different
axiom, similar in the spirit, tough not following the very sa me pattern, was applied in [ 1].
1 Preliminaries
We denote the ideals of meagre and null subsets of reals by M, andNrespectively. For an
uncountable cardinal κ,H(κ)is the family of all sets whose transitive closure has size < κ.
The sequence {∗α|α < ω 1}of sets from H(κ)iscontinuous if∗α={∗β|β < α}for any
limitα<ω 1. We ﬁx a well ordering ≺∗ofH(c+). Forκ≥ωwe denote by Bκthe forcing
associated with the measure algebra on 2κ, and byCκ, the Cohen forcing on 2κ, that is
Cκ={p: dom(p)→2|dom(p)∈[κ]<ω}.
We writeN≺Mfor"Nis an elementary substructure of M", ands⊏tfor"sis an initial
segment of a sequence t".

12 Abstract invariants of the continuum
Deﬁnition 2.1 ([16]).A triple(A,B,E)is called an invariant , if
1.A,B∈H(c+),
2.E⊆A×B,
3.∀a∈A∃b∈B(a,b)∈E,
4.∀b∈B∃a∈A(a,b)/∈E.
We customary write aEb instead of (a,b)∈E. Also, for a set A′⊆Awe writeA′Ebto
abbreviate ∀a∈A′aEb . This convention allows us to write ([A]≤ω,B,E)in a meaningful
way.
Deﬁnition 2.2. If(A,B,E)is an invariant, then its evaluation is the cardinal
/a\}bracketle{tA,B,E/a\}bracketri}ht= min{|X| |X⊆B,∀a∈A∃x∈X aEx }
We will be mostly interested in the invariants from the follo wing list, where I ∈ {M,N}.
By<∗we denote the order of eventual domination on ωω, i.e.
f <∗g⇐⇒ ∃n<ω∀k>n f(k)<g(k).
•cov(I) = (R,I,∈),
•non(I) = (I,R,/\e}atio\slash∋),
•cof(I) = (I,I,⊆),
•add(I) = (I,I,/\e}atio\slash⊇),
•b= (ωω,ωω,/\e}atio\slash>∗),
•d= (ωω,ωω,<∗),
•r= (2ω,[ω]ω,“restriction is eventually constant ”).
Deﬁnition 2.3 ([13]).If(A,B,E)is an invariant, we denote by Φ(A,B,E)the following
sentence:
∀F: 2<ω1→A∃g:ω1→B∀f∈2ω1
the set
{α<ω1|F(f↾α)Eg(α)}
is stationary.
To putΦ(A,B,E)into some context, Φ(A,B,E)is a consequence of ♦, for any invariant
(A,B,E), and♦is equivalent to Φ(R,R,=). Also, the weak diamond introduced in [ 4] is
justΦ(2,2,=)(and is equivalent to 2ω<2ω1). However, a restricted variant of Φ(A,B,E)
proved more fruitful in applications.
Deﬁnition 2.4. An invariant (A,B,E)isBorel ifA,B are Polish spaces, and Eis a Borel
subset ofA×B. A function F: 2<ω1→Ais Borel, if every restriction F↾2α, forα<ω1
is Borel.
Deﬁnition 2.5. If(A,B,E)is a Borel invariant, by ♦(A,B,E)we denote the following
sentence:
For every Borel function F: 2<ω1→A, there exists g:ω1→Bsuch that for all f∈2ω1,
the set
{α<ω1|F(f↾α)Eg(α)}
is stationary.
In the forthcoming sections Nwill always denote a transitive model of ZFC−, that is
ZFC with the powerset axiom excluded, such that moreover N⊇H(ω1). OnlyN⊆H(c+)
will be relevant for us, but we don’t need to assume this expli citly. Often we will require that
Deﬁnition 2.6. An invariant (A,B,E)isdeﬁnable over Nif the setsA, B , andEare deﬁn-
able subsets of (N;∈).
Note that, by deﬁnition, every invariant is deﬁnable over H(c+). We also ﬁx a bijection
Σ : 2ω→H(ω1), deﬁnable over H(ω1).
23 Games G(A,B,E)(H,B)on transitive structures
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let(A,B,E)be an invariant. Suppose that H={hα|α<ω1}is a sequence
of parameters from N, andB={bα|α < ω 1}is a sequence of parameters from B. The
gameG(A,B,E)(H,B)onNis deﬁned by the following rules:
1. in an even step α,BAD plays∗α∈H(ω1),
2. in an odd step α+ 1,GOOD plays a countable elementary submodel Mα+1≺N,
such that
{∗α,hα,{Mβ|β <α, β is odd}} ∈Mα+1,
3. ifαis limit, then
∗α={∗β|β <α, β is even}.
GOOD wins, if after all ω1many steps the following set is stationary
{α<ω1|A∩Mα+1Ebα}.
Let us make some comments on the deﬁnition. The sequence Hplays a different role
than{∗α|α < ω 1}in two ways: ﬁrstly, typically Bwill depend on H, whilst it will be
independent of {∗α|α < ω 1}. Secondly, Hdoesn’t have to be continuous. The continuity
of parameters ∗αis however necessary for GOOD to have a chance to win: otherwise BAD
can just play ∗α=bαevery time. If N= H(c+), we can slightly simplify the deﬁnition, by
putting already the full sequence HintoM1. But in general Hdoesn’t need to be an element
ofN, so the models Mαmust unveil it gradually.
In practice, the condition
A∩Mα+1Ebα
will often be saying that bαis a Cohen/random/dominating real over Mα+1. We list some
instances of this phenomenon.
(A,B,E) the relation A∩MEb
non(M)bis a Cohen real over M
non(N)bis a random real over M
d bis a dominating real over M
b bis an unbounded real over M
r bis a reaping real over M
cov(M)bis a meagre set such that R∩M⊆b
cov(N)bis a null set such that R∩M⊆b
([R]ω,R,/\e}atio\slash=)b∈R\M
(R,[R]ω,∈)b⊆Ris countable, and R∩M⊆b
So, informally speaking, GOOD is trying to ensure that the models Mα+1are:
1. Big enough to contain H, and whatever BAD wants them to contain,
2. Small enough, so that the reals bα, given in advance, are "generic" over the correspond-
ing models.
The principle we will now introduce, is saying that there is a lways a sequence of bα’s, so that
GOOD can win.
3.1 Strategic diamond
Deﬁnition 3.2. Thestrategic diamond , denoted ♦STR((A,B,E),N), is the following prin-
ciple: For each sequence of parameters H, there exists a sequence Bsuch that GOOD has a
winning strategy in G(A,B,E)(H,B)onN.
♦∗
STR((A,B,E),N)is a version with club instead of stationary . IfN= (H(ω1);∈,≺∗),
omit it.
It might be the case that BAD plays consecutive elements of some continuous sequence
{∗α|α < ω 1}given in advance, and doesn’t look at the plays of GOOD . This situation
gives rise to a principle we call elementary diamond . In fact, at the current stage of research,
there is no visible advantage of strategic diamond over a sim pler, and seemingly weaker,
elementary diamond, we will now introduce.
33.2 Elementary diamond
Deﬁnition 3.3. Theelementary diamond , denoted ♦EL((A,B,E),N), is the following prin-
ciple: For each sequence of parameters H, there exists a sequence Bsuch that for any contin-
uous sequence {∗α|α < ω 1} ⊆H(ω1)there exists a chain of elementary submodels of N,
{Mα|α<ω1}, that satisfy
•∀α<ω1{∗α, hα,{Mβ|β <α}} ∈Mα+1,
• the set
{α<ω1|A∩Mα+1Ebα}
is stationary.
♦∗
EL((A,B,E),N)is a version with club instead of stationary . IfN= (H(ω1);∈,≺∗),
omit it.
We will see that there is no loss of generality in assuming tha t the sets∗αare of the form
∗α=X∩α, for someX⊆ω1. The relations between ♦EL((A,B,E),N),♦STR((A,B,E),N),
and instances of Φ(A,B,E)will heavily depend on the structure N. Recall that ([A]≤ω,B,E)
is deﬁned by
aEb⇐⇒ ∀x∈a x∈b.
Proposition 3.4. For any invariant (A,B,E), and anyN, the following holds:
♦STR((A,B,E),N)⇐⇒ ♦ STR(([A]≤ω,B,E),N),
♦EL((A,B,E),N)⇐⇒ ♦ EL(([A]≤ω,B,E),N).
Proof. It is sufﬁcient to show that for any countable M≺N, andb∈B, the relation
A∩MEb
implies
[A]ω∩MEb.
To see this, ﬁx any a∈[A]ω∩M. Sinceais countable, a⊆M, and soaEb .
3.3G(A,B,E)(H,B)onH(c+)
In the simplest case, both strategic and elementary diamond s are reformulations of Φ(A,B,E).
Theorem 3.5. The following conditions are equivalent for any invariant (A,B,E):
1.♦STR((A,B,E),H(c+)),
2.♦EL((A,B,E),H(c+)),
3.♦EL((A,B,E),H(c+)), restricted to the case where ∗α=X∩α,for someX⊆ω1,
4.Φ([A]≤ω,B,E).
Proof.1.=⇒2.
Fix a sequence H, and letBbe such that GOOD has a winning strategy in G(A,B,E)(H,B).
Let{∗α|α<ω1}be arbitrary. Consider a run of the game G(A,B,E)(H,B)onH(c+), where
BAD plays the sets ∗α, regardless of the plays of GOOD . Let{Mα|α<ω 1}be a chain of
elementary submodels resulting from the plays of GOOD , according to the winning strategy.
It is straightforward that {Mα|α<ω1}witnesses ♦EL((A,B,E),H(c+)).
2.=⇒3.Clear.
3.=⇒4.
LetF: 2<ω1→Abe any function. As a set of parameters H, we sethα=F↾2α.
LetBbe a sequence obtained from ♦EL((A,B,E),H(c+)). Finally, let f∈2ω1be given.
Using♦EL((A,B,E),H(c+))we can ﬁnd a chain {Mα|α<ω1}of elementary submodels,
satisfying:
•∀α<ω1f↾α, F↾2α∈Mα+1,
4• there is a stationary set of α<ω1for which
A∩Mα+1Ebα.
But the latter bullet ensures, in particular, that F(f↾α)Ebα. This shows that Bwitnesses
Φ(A,B,E).
4.=⇒1.
LetHbe a given sequence of parameters. We deﬁne the suitable func tionF: 2<ω1→[A]ω
by the induction: suppose that F↾2βis deﬁned for all β < α . Fors∈2<ω1let us deﬁne
(recursively) M(s)as some countable elementary submodel of H(c+), that contains s,H,
and the set
{M(s′)|s′⊏s}.
Givens∈2α, we putF(s) =A∩M(s).
Let{bα|α < ω 1}be a guessing sequence for F. We describe the winning strategy for
GOOD.The strategy will consist of building a chain of models Mαtogether with functions
fα∈2<ω1, coding the sets ∗α. Suppose we want to deﬁne Mα+1, andfα.
• Ifα= 0, we putfα=∅.
• Ifαis successor, then BAD just played ∗α, whereα=β+2. We setfα=f⌢
βtβ+2,
wheretβ+2∈2ω, and∗α= Σ(tβ+2).
• Ifαis limit, we put fα=/uniondisplay
β<αfβ. Since∗α={∗β|β <α},∗αis deﬁnable from fα
by the formula
φ(x) = “xis a function with the domain {β <α|βis even},
∀β∈dom(x)β= (γ+1)·2 =⇒x(β) = Σ(fα↾[ω·γ,ω·(γ+1))),
∀β∈dom(x)βis limit=⇒x(β) ={x(δ)|δ∈dom(x)∩β}.”
In both cases, we put Mα+1=M(fα). Notice that for all α < ω 1,fα·2∈2ω·α, and forα
limit,fα∈2ω·α. Why is this a correct strategy?
•hα∈Mα+1=M(fα), since bothαandHare elements of M(fα).
•∗α∈Mα+1since, as we noticed, ∗αis deﬁnable from fα.
•{Mβ|β <α, β is odd} ∈M(fα), because {Mβ|β <α, β is odd}is deﬁnable from
{M(s)|s⊏fα} ∈M(fα).
Finally, why is this a winning strategy? Let f=/uniondisplay
α<ω1fα. For club many α < ω 1, it is the
case thatfα∈2α, soMα+1=M(fα) =M(f↾α). For stationarily many of these αit is
the case that F(f↾α)Ebα, butF(f↾α) =A∩M(f↾α) =A∩Mα+1.
3.4G(A,B,E)(H,B)onH(κ)
In the case when N= H(κ)for arbitrary regular κ, we were not able to reproduce the pre-
vious result. We can still prove that the principles ♦EL((A,B,E),N)and♦(A,B,E)are
closely related, while the apparent mismatch comes from dif ferent restrictions on the function
F.
Letκbe a ﬁxed uncountable regular cardinal. We denote by θthetruth predicate for
(H(κ);∈,≺∗), i.e. a relation such that for any formula φin the language {∈,≺∗}, withn
free variables, and any x1,...,xn∈H(κ)
θ(φ,x1,...,xn)⇐⇒(H(κ);∈,≺∗)|=φ(x1,...,xn).
It is standard to verify that in the structure (H(κ);∈,≺∗,θ)we can write the formula
φ(m) = ”mis a countable elementary submodel of (H(κ);∈,≺∗)”.
5Theorem 3.6. For any invariant (A,B,E), deﬁnable over (H(κ);∈), each of the following
conditions implies the next:
1.Φ([A]≤ω,B,E), restricted to functions F, such thatF↾2αis deﬁnable over the
structure (H(κ);∈,≺∗,θ), for eachα<ω1,
2.♦STR((A,B,E),H(κ)),
3.♦EL((A,B,E),H(κ)), restricted to the case where ∗α=X∩α,for someX⊆ω1,
4.♦EL((A,B,E),H(κ)),
5.Φ([A]≤ω,B,E), restricted to functions F, such thatF↾2αis deﬁnable over the
structure (H(κ);∈,≺∗), for eachα<ω1.
Proof of Theorem 3.6. 1.=⇒2.
LetH={hα|α<ω 1}be a given sequence of parameters. We deﬁne the suitable func tion
F: 2<ω1→Aby the induction: suppose that F↾2βis deﬁned for all β <α . Fors∈2<ω1
let us deﬁne (recursively) M(s)as the≺∗-least countable elementary submodel of (H(κ),∈),
that contains s,{hβ|β <|s|}, and the set
{M(s′)|s′⊏s}.
Givens∈2α, we putF(s) =A∩M(s).
Notice that this deﬁnition can be written "inside" (H(κ);∈,≺∗,θ). Let{bα|α<ω 1}be
a guessing sequence for F. We describe the winning strategy for GOOD.The strategy will
consist of building a chain of models Mαtogether with functions fα∈2<ω1, coding the sets
∗α. Suppose we want to deﬁne Mα+1, andfα.
• Ifα= 0, we putfα=∅.
• Ifαis successor, then BAD just played ∗α, whereα=β+2. We setfα=f⌢
βtβ+2,
wheretβ+2∈2ω, and∗α= Σ(tβ+2).
• Ifαis limit, we put fα=/uniondisplay
β<αfβ. Since∗α={∗β|β <α},∗αis deﬁnable from fα
by the formula
φ(x) = “xis a function with the domain {β <α|βis even},
∀β∈dom(x)β= (γ+1)·2 =⇒x(β) = Σ(fα↾[ω·γ,ω·(γ+1))),
∀β∈dom(x)βis limit=⇒x(β) ={x(δ)|δ∈dom(x)∩β}.”
In both cases, we choose Mα+1=M(fα). Notice that for all α<ω 1,fα·2∈2ω·α, and for
αlimit,fα∈2ω·α. Why isF↾2αis deﬁnable over (H(κ);∈,≺∗,θ)? This follows outright
from the deﬁnition. Why is this a correct strategy?
•hα∈Mα+1=M(fα), since{fβ|β <|dom(fα)|} ∈M(fα), and|dom(fα)| ≥α.
•∗α∈Mα+1since, as we noticed, ∗αis deﬁnable from fα.
•{Mβ|β <α, β is odd} ∈M(fα), because {Mβ|β <α, β is odd}is deﬁnable from
{M(s)|s⊆fα} ∈M(fα).
Finally, why is this a winning strategy? Let f=/uniondisplay
α<ω1fα. For club many α < ω 1, it is
the case that fα∈2α, soMα+1=M(fα) =M(f↾α). NowF(f↾α)Ebαholds on a
stationary set, but F(f↾α) =A∩M(f↾α) =A∩Mα+1.
2.=⇒3.Like in Theorem 3.5.
3.=⇒4.Since{∗α|α < ω 1}is continuous, we can ﬁnd f∈2ω1such that ∗αis
deﬁnable (in H(ω1)) fromf↾α, for each limit α<ω1.
4.=⇒5.Like in Theorem 3.5, except that instead of having hα=F↾2α,hαis a
set of parameters in the deﬁnition of F↾2α, so thatMα+1can compute the values of this
function.
63.5 Tukey connections
We can compare invariants with respect to Tukey connections .
Deﬁnition 3.7 ([16]).If(A1,B1,E1),(A2,B2,E2)are invariants, a Tukey connection from
(A1,B1,E1)to(A2,B2,E2)is a pair of mappings φ:A1→A2, andψ:B2→B1that
satisfy
φ(a)E2b=⇒aE1ψ(b),
for alla∈A1,b∈B2.
In the spirit of Propositions 2.8, and 4.9 in [ 13], we obtain:
Theorem 3.8. Let(A1,B1,E1),(A2,B2,E2)be invariants, and let (φ,ψ)be a Tukey con-
nection from (A1,B1,E1)to(A2,B2,E2), whereφis deﬁnable over N. Then the following
implications hold
♦STR((A2,B2,E2),N) =⇒ ♦STR((A1,B1,E1),N),
♦EL((A2,B2,E2),N) =⇒ ♦EL((A1,B1,E1),N).
Proof. We give a proof for the ﬁrst implication, for the other one can be proved essentially
the same way. Fix H ⊆H(ω1), and letB={bα|α < ω 1} ⊆B2be such that GOOD
has a winning strategy in G(A2,B2,E2)(H,B). LetB∗={ψ(bα)|α < ω 1}. We will check
that essentially the very same strategy is winning in G(A1,B1,E1)(H,B∗).Essentially means
that we want to play models that are closed under φ, and for this reason they must contain
all possible parameters from the deﬁnition of φ. This can be obviously ensured, for example
by pretending that BAD played these parameters in his ﬁrst move. Now, since φis deﬁnable,
we have
φ[A1∩Mα+1]⊆A2∩Mα+1
at every step of the game. For this reason
A2∩Mα+1E2bα=⇒φ[A1∩Mα+1]E2bα=⇒A1∩Mα+1E1ψ(bα).
This shows that the strategy is winning in G(A1,B1,E1)(H,B∗), and concludes the proof.
4 Forcing ♦EL(A,B,E), and♦STR(A,B,E)
The principles ♦(A,B,E)/♦EL((A,B,E),N)can be forced either with ﬁnite or countable
conditions. Forcing ♦(A,B,E)with ﬁnite supports was systematically studied by H. Minami
in [12], and [ 11]. On the other hand, the authors of [ 13] give a general method for constructing
models of ♦(A,B,E)using countable supports. In both cases the resulting model s will
actually satisfy ♦(A,B,E)for much bigger class of functions F, than merely Borel. This
was relevant in [ 3], where the authors apply ♦(A,B,E)forFfromL(R). We give a sample
of different arguments, to give the reader an idea of what kin ds of can be applied in our
setting.
4.1 With ﬁnite supports
By Theorem III.2 from [ 9], forcing with a measure algebra over a model of ♦preserves
certain weaker form of ♦(d). It turns out, that ♦EL(d)in the ground model is sufﬁcient.
Theorem 4.1. For anyκ≥ω, forcing with Bκpreserves both ♦STR(d), and♦EL(d).
Proof. We give the proof for ♦STR(d). The case of ♦EL(d)is an easy modiﬁcation of this
one.
LetG⊆Bκbe a generic ﬁlter over V. For anyx∈H(ω1)V[G]there exists a random (over
V) real, sayrx, such thatx∈V[rx]. Therefore we can ﬁnd a Bω-name˙xforxsuch that
V[G]|= ˙x[rx] =x. SinceBωis a Borel forcing notion, we have ˙x∈H(ω1).
We describe the winning strategy for GOOD overH(ω1)V[G], by playing a parallel game in
H(ω1)V. LetH∗={˙hα|α<ω1}be a sequence of Bω-names for the parameters hα.
Suppose∗αisBAD ’s move in V[G]. We then command BAD∗(theBAD ’s clone from the
ground model) to play a Bω-name˙∗αfor∗αinV. InV,GOOD∗(theGOOD ’s clone from the
ground model) responds with M∗
α+1≺H(ω1)V, according to the winning strategy. Notice,
that we can always replace a name for a sequence by a sequence o f names for its elements, so
BAD∗will comply with the continuity condition. Finally, GOOD playsMα+1=M∗
α+1[rα],
whererαis a random real over V, chosen so that the following holds:
71.˙hα[rα] =hα,
2.˙∗α[rα] =∗α,
3.M∗
α+1[rα]contains{rβ|β <α}.
Apart from the relation Mα+1≺H(ω1)V[G], we need to check the following:
1.hα,∗α∈Mα+1,
2.{Mβ|β <α} ∈Mα+1.
First point follows from ˙hα,˙∗α∈M∗
α+1. Second point is a consequence of the relation
{M∗
β|β <α} ∈M∗
α+1, and the fact that Mβ=M∗
β[rβ], for every successor β <α .
For the veriﬁcation of the Tarski-Vaught criterion, suppos e that
H(ω1)V[G]|=∃yφ(m,y),
for somem∈Mα+1. Fixmandyas above. There exist Bω-names˙m, and˙yfor which we
have
H(ω1)V|=Bω⊩φ( ˙m,˙y),
and˙m∈M∗
α+1. SinceM∗
α+1≺H(ω1)V, we can assume that ˙y∈M∗
α+1as well, and so
˙y[rα]∈Mα+1. It follows that
H(ω1)V[G]|=φ(m,˙y[rα]).
This shows that Mα+1≺H(ω1)V[G].
It is easy to see that the strategy is winning: whenever a real is dominating over M∗
α+1,
it is also dominating over Mα+1=M∗
α+1[rα], and stationary sets remain stationary in the
extension.
Remark. A similar argument shows that the Cohen forcing Cκover a model of ♦STR(d)
preserves ♦STR(b).
The next theorem is basically a reformulation of an analogou s result from [ 13], which in
turn is a special case of Theorem 2.12 from [ 11].
Theorem 4.2. Cω1, andBω1force♦∗
STR(non(M))and♦∗
STR(non(N))respectively.
Proof. We prove the theorem for Cω1, the other case is similar. Let H∗={˙hα|α < ω 1}
be a sequence of Cω1-names for parameters in H(ω1). LetGα=G∩Cα, whereGisCω1-
generic. We pick an increasing function φ:ω1→ω1such thatGφ(α)decides the value of
˙hα[G]. Finally, let cα=G∩[φ(α),φ(α) +ω). We claim that with B={cα|α < ω 1},
GOOD has a winning strategy.
The winning strategy is simple: GOOD choosesMα+1so thatMα+1contains all necessary
content (that is, some parameter hα, initial fragment X∩αof someX⊆ω1, and the set of
previous moves {Mβ|β <α}), and moreover
Mα+1≺H(ω1)V[Gγ],
for someγas small as possible. We will show that, on a club set, such γis at mostφ(α).
Since thencαis a Cohen real over Mα+1, this will ﬁnish the proof (except for checking the
elementarity).
Let˙Xbe aCω1-name for a subset of ω1, and letψ:ω1→ω1be a continuous function such
that for allα<ω 1,Gψ(α)decides the value of ˙X∩α. A simple inductive argument shows
thatGOOD can always choose the model Mα+1, so thatMα+1≺H(ω1)V[Gφ(α)+ψ(α)]. But
for club many αwe haveψ(α) =α, and soMα+1≺H(ω1)V[Gφ(α)].
We need to check that Mα+1is indeed an elementary submodel of H(ω1). For this, it is
sufﬁcient to show the following
Lemma 4.3. For any inﬁnite α<ω ,
H(ω1)V[Gα]≺H(ω1)V[G].
8Proof.
H(ω1)[G]|=φ(x0,...,xn,y),
wherex0,...,xn∈V[Gα]. InH(ω1)Vwe have corresponding Cω-names˙x0,...,˙xn,˙y,
such that for a certain r∈2ω∩V[Gα]
V[r]|= ˙x0[r] =x0,...,˙xn[r] =xn,
and
H(ω1)|=Cω⊩φ(˙x0,...,˙xn,˙y).
Therefore
H(ω1)[Gα]|=φ(˙x0[r],...,˙xn[r],˙y[r]).
In particular ˙y[r]∈V[Gα], and this concludes the veriﬁcation of elementarity.
This ﬁnishes the proof of the theorem.
4.2 With countable supports
We give a version of the result from [ 13].
Theorem 4.4 (Thm. 6.6, [ 13]).Let{Pα∗˙Qα|α<ω 2}be a countable support iteration of
Borel forcing notions such that for each α<ω2,
Pα⊩“˙Qαis equivalent to P(2)+×˙Qα”.
Assume that Pω2is proper, and
Pω2⊩/a\}bracketle{t[A]ω,B,E/a\}bracketri}ht ≤ω1
for some invariant (A,B,E)deﬁnable over H(ω1). ThenPω2⊩♦STR(A,B,E).
The proof of Thm. 6.6 from [ 13] gives almost that. The only place we need some im-
provement is Lemma 6.12.
Lemma 4.5 (variant of Lemma 6.12, [ 13]).Let(A,B,E)be an invariant deﬁnable over
H(ω1), such that /a\}bracketle{tA,B,E/a\}bracketri}ht ≤ω1. Assume that Tis a tree such that
•Tisω-distributive,
•For everyt∈Tthere exists an uncountable antichain below t.
Proof. Just follow the proof of Lemma 6.12 in [ 13], for an invariant ([A]ω,B,E), and a
functionF: 2<ω1→[A]ω, which is deﬁnable over (H(ω1);∈,≺∗,θ), whereθis a truth
predicate for H(ω1). The result now follows from Theorem 3.6.

5.1 Suslin tree
Let us review some standard deﬁnitions. A nonempty set T⊆2<γis atree, if it is closed for
taking initial segments. Recall that s⊏tmeans thatsis an initial segment of t. We denote
as|t|thelength oft, i.e. the order-type its domain. For α<γ , we deﬁne the α-th level of a
treeT:
Tα={t∈T||t|=α}.
Therestriction ofTtot∈Tis the set of all extensions of t:
T↾t={s∈T|t⊏s}.
Deﬁnition 5.1. For a countable, limit ordinal α, a treeT⊆2<αis
•ever-branching if
∀t∈T∃t′≻t t′⌢0,t′⌢1∈T,
•normal if
∀t∈T∀β <α∃t′≻t|t′|>β.
9Theorem 5.2 (Thm. 3.1, [ 13]).If♦EL(non(M))holds, then there exists a Suslin tree.
Proof. Let{cα|α<ω1}be a sequence witnessing ♦EL(non(M))forH=∅. Eachcα∈2ω
is a ﬁlter in the partial order 2<ω, so it uniquely extends to a ﬁlter in the algebra Cω– the
completion of 2<ω. LetGαdenote this extension.
We will build a normal, ever-branching tree Tlevel by level, starting from T0={∅}. If
α=β+1, we just extend each element of Tβ, i.e.
Tα={t⌢0,t⌢1|t∈Tβ}.
Ifαis limit, we extend each t∈T<αto a branchbt∈2αaccordingly with cα: letitbe the
≺∗-least dense embedding of T↾tintoCω, and put
bt=i−1
t[Gα].
Finally, we put T=/uniontext{Tα|α<ω1}. We will check that Thas no uncountable antichain.
Let{∗α|α < ω 1}be a continuous enumeration of a maximal antichain in T. A standard
argument shows that for club-many α,∗αis a maximal antichain in T<α, therefore we can
ﬁnd suchα, together with a model Mα+1, which satisﬁes:
•∗α, T<α∈Mα+1,
•cαis a Cohen real over Mα+1.
In this case also GαisCω-generic over Mα+1, and since each embedding it, fort∈T<α, is
inMα+1, alsobtis a generic branch through T<α, overMα+1. We aim to show that ∗αis a
maximal antichain in T<α. Fixt∈T<αifthas an initial segment in ∗α, there is nothing to
prove. Otherwise, consider the set
{t′≻t| ∃β <α t′∩β∈ ∗α}.
Since∗αis maximal in T<α, this set is dense above tinT<α. Since the branch btwas generic
overMα+1,btmust have an initial fragment in ∗α. This concludes the proof.
5.2♣AD(ω1,1,DIAG)
The result we present was also originally proved in [ 13]. We formulate it in the language of
[15].
Deﬁnition 5.3. The principle ♣AD(ω1,1,DIAG) asserts the existence of a sequence {Aα|α<
ω1}such that:
1. For each limit α<ω1,Aα⊆αis coﬁnal;
2. For anyα<β <ω 1,sup(Aα∩Aβ)<α;
3. For each sequence {Bγ|γ <ω1}consisting of coﬁnal subsets of ω1, the set
{α<ω1| ∀γ <α B γ∩Aαis coﬁnal in α}
is stationary.
Theorem 5.4. ♦EL(b)implies♣AD(ω1,1,DIAG) , with eachAαhaving order-type ω.
Proof. We ﬁx a♦EL(b)-sequence {dα|α<ω1}, subject to a sequence of initial parameters
H={{Bα
n}n<ω|α<ω1},
where for every limit α,{Bα
n}n<ω is a ﬁxed partition of αinto inﬁnite sets, such that when-
evern<m , each element of Bα
nis below each element of Bα
m.
Informally, we pick to Aαthe ﬁrstdα(n)-many elements from each set Bα
n. More pre-
cisely, we enumerate bijectively each of the sets
Bα
n={bα
n,i}i<ω,
10and set
Aα=/uniondisplay
n<ω{bα
n,0,...,bα
n,dα(n)}.
Why does that work? Fix a family {Bγ|γ < ω 1}consisting of coﬁnal subsets of ω1. We
associate with it a continuous sequence of hereditarily cou ntable sets ∗α, by setting
∗α={Bδ∩α|δ<α}.
There exists a stationary set of α, for which dαis not dominated by any real from some
modelMα+1containing ∗α={∗β|β <α}, and{Bα
n}n<ω. It is clear that for each β <α ,
Bβ∩α∈Mα+1. A standard closing-off argument shows that for club-many α’s, each of the
sets{Bδ∩α}δ<αis coﬁnal in α. We work with ﬁxed β <α , such that
•Bβ∩αis coﬁnal in α,
•Bβ∩α∈Mα+1,
•dαis an unbounded real over Mα+1.
LetA={n<ω|Bβ∩Bα
n/\e}atio\slash=∅}. Obviously, since Bβ∩αis coﬁnal, this set is inﬁnite and
belongs toMα+1.
LetA(n)denote then-th element of A, and set
r(n) = min{i<ω|bα
A(n),i∈Bβ}.
Given thatr∈ωω∩Mα+1, the inequality r(n)<dα(A(n))holds for inﬁnitely many n<ω .
It’s now easy to see that Aα∩Bβis inﬁnite.
5.3♣AD(ω1,ω,DIAG)
We prove another result in the same spirit.
Deﬁnition 5.5. The principle ♣AD(ω1,ω,DIAG) asserts the existence of a sequence {Bn
α|α<
ω1, n<ω}such that:
1. For each limit α<ω1, and eachn<ω ,Bn
α⊆αis coﬁnal;
2. For anyα<β <ω 1,m,n<ω ,sup(Bn
α∩Bm
β)<α;
3. For each sequence {Xγ|γ <ω1}consisting of coﬁnal subsets of ω1, the set
{α<ω1| ∀γ <α∀n<ω X γ∩Bn
αis coﬁnal in α}
is stationary.
Lemma 5.6. Supposer,d∈ωωare strictly increasing, and r <∗d. Letf∈ωωbe deﬁned
by
f(n) =d◦...◦d(n),
where the composition is taken ntimes. Then for all but ﬁnitely many n<ω we have
[f(n),f(n+1))∩rg(r)/\e}atio\slash=∅.
Proof. Without loss of generality r(k)>k for allk. Supposer(k)<f(n). We must show
thatr(k+1)<f(n+1) . But we have
r(k+1)≤d(k+1)≤d(r(k))≤d(f(n))<f(n+1).
Recall that ♦∗
EL(d)is just♦EL(d)that guesses on a club, instead of a stationary set.
Theorem 5.7. ♦∗
EL(d)implies♣AD(ω1,ω,DIAG) , with eachAαhaving order-type ω.
11Proof. By the previous theorem we can ﬁx a sequence {Aα|α∈lim(ω1)}witnessing
♣AD(ω1,1,DIAG) , eachAαhaving order-type ω, and all intervals of the form [Aα(n),Aα(n+
1))being inﬁnite. Let {dξ|ξ∈lim(ω1)}be a sequence of (strictly increasing) reals witness-
ing♦∗
EL(d)for initial parameters hα=Aα. Letφ:ω×ω→ωbe a deﬁnable bijection, and
deﬁne
Bn
α={Aα(i)|i∈/uniondisplay
k<ωIα
φ(n,k)},
where
Iα
k= [dk
α(k),dk+1
α(k+1)),
for eachk<ω (heredndenote then-th iteration of d).
To see that this works, consider a family {Xα|α<ω1}of coﬁnal subsets of ω1, and put
∗δ={Xβ∩α|α<β <δ },
for allδ∈ω1. Clearly this sequence is continuous. By ♦∗
EL(d)there exists a sequence of
elementary submodels {Mα|α<ω1}such that on a club set of ξ <ω1
•{Xβ|β <ξ} ∈Mξ+1,
•dξis a dominating real over Mξ+1,
•sup(Aξ∩Xβ) =ξ, for allβ <ξ .
Notice that here we used the feature of guessing on a club: the sets
{ξ<ω1| ∀β <ξ A ξ∩Xβis coﬁnal},
and
{ξ<ω1|dξis dominating over Mξ+1}
need to intersect on a club. Now ﬁx β <ξ , whereξis as above, and let
r={i<ω|Aξ(i)∈Xβ}.
By Lemma 5.6 the set ris inﬁnite, and r∈Mξ+1, thereforer∩Iξ
k/\e}atio\slash=∅for all but ﬁnitely
manyk<ω . It follows that for any n<ω ,r∩Iξ
φ(n,k)/\e}atio\slash=∅, for all but ﬁnitely many k<ω .
Buti∈r∩Iξ
φ(n,k)impliesAξ(i)∈Xβ∩Bn
ξ. It follows that Xβ∩Bn
ξis inﬁnite, and
therefore coﬁnal in ξ.
5.4ℵ1-generated P-point
Theorem 5.8 (Thm. 7.8, [ 13]).If♦EL(r)holds, then there exists an ℵ1-generated P-point.
Proof. Let{rα|α < ω 1}be a♦EL(r)-sequence, for the sequence of initial parameters
consisting of bijections hα:α→ω. Let{r∗
α|α < ω 1}be a sequence of reals (more
precisely, inﬁnite subsets of ω) deﬁned inductively by conditions:
1.r∗
0=r0,
2. Ifr∗
αis known for α<β , then deﬁne f<β:ω→ωby
f<β(n) = min(/intersectiondisplay
k<n+1r∗
hβ(k)\f<β(n−1)),
for alln >0(letf(0) = 0 ). Then the image of f<βis a pseudointersection of the
family{r∗
α|α<β}, that is deﬁnable from hβ,{r∗
α|α<β}. Finally, put
r∗
β={f<β(n)|n∈rβ}.
LetU={a∈[ω]ω| ∃β < ω 1r∗
β⊆∗a}. ClearlyUis a P-ﬁlter. Let us verify that it
is also an ultraﬁlter. Let a∈[ω]ωbe arbitrary, and take a chain of elementary submodels
{Mα|α<ω1}such that for coﬁnally many β <ω1:
•rβis reaping over Mβ+1,
12•a,{rα|α<β},{hα|α≤β} ∈Mβ+1.
Note that in this case, also {r∗
α|α < β} ∈Mβ+1. Fix such ordinal β. Letb⊆ωbe such
thatf<β[b] =f<β[ω]\a. Notice that b∈Mβ+1. Given that rβis reaping over Mβ+1, either
rβ⊆∗b, or|rβ∩b|<ω.
In the ﬁrst case, we got
r∗
β=f<β[rβ]⊆∗f<β[b] =f<β[ω]\a⊆ω\a.
This ensures that ω\a∈U.
In the second case, we got
|r∗
β∩f<β[b]|<ω,
and in turn
|r∗
β∩(f<β[ω]\a)|<ω.
It follows that r∗
β⊆∗a, and soa∈U.
5.5♣w2
The axiom ♣w2is a weakening of ♣studied initially in [ 7], and [ 5].
Deﬁnition 5.9. The principle ♣w2asserts the existence of a sequence {Cα|α∈lim(ω1)},
where eachCαis a coﬁnal subset of α, and for every coﬁnal X⊆ω1, the set
{α<ω1| |Cα\X|<ω or|Cα∩X|<ω}
is stationary.
Theorem 5.10 (Lemma 2.4, [ 10]).♦EL(r) =⇒ ♣w2
Proof. Let{rα|α∈ω1} ⊆[ω]ωbe a sequence witnessing ♦EL(r)for the parameters
hα=σα, where for each limit α<ω 1σα:ω→αis an increasing function onto a coﬁnal
subset. Now, for each limit αwe putCα=σα[rα]. We claim that {Cα|α∈lim(ω1)}is a
♣w2-sequence.
Indeed, ﬁxX⊆ω1, and let{Mα|α < ω 1}be the corresponding ♦EL(r)-chain. For
stationarily many α, both of the following holds
•X∩α,σα∈Mα+1,
•rαis reaping over Mα+1.
In particular, either rα⊆∗σ−1
α[X∩α], orσ−1
α[X∩α]∩rαis ﬁnite. It follows that Cα=
σα[rα]is either almost contained in X∩αor almost disjoint with it.
