ABSTRACT
To beneﬁt the complementary information between hetero-
geneous data, we introduce a new Multimodal Transformer
(MMFormer) for Remote Sensing (RS) image classiﬁcation
using Hyperspectral Image (HSI) accompanied by another
source of data such as Light Detection and Ranging (Li-
DAR). Compared with traditional Vision Transformer (ViT)
lacking inductive biases of convolutions, we ﬁrst introduce
convolutional layers to our MMFormer to tokenize patches
from multimodal data of HSI and LiDAR. Then we propose
a Multi-scale Multi-head Self-Attention (MSMHSA) module
to address the problem of compatibility which often limits
to fuse HSI with high spectral resolution and LiDAR with
relatively low spatial resolution. The proposed MSMHSA
module can incorporate HSI to LiDAR data in a coarse-to-ﬁne
manner enabling us to learn a ﬁne-grained representation. Ex-
tensive experiments on widely used benchmarks (e.g., Trento
and MUUFL) demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed MMFormer for RS image classiﬁcation.

1. INTRODUCTION
Remote sensing (RS) has been playing an vital role in vari-
ous Earth Observing (EO) tasks because of its rapid imaging
feature and wide application prospect. Generally, RS can be
used (but not limited) in different tasks, such as landcover
classiﬁcation [1–3], mineral and forest resources exploration
[4], object/target detection [5, 6], environmental monitoring
[7], urban planning [8], biodiversity conservation, as well as
disaster response and management. With the ever-growing
availability of RS data, research on RS has begun to shift
to data-driven methods, and various Machine Learning (ML)
and Deep Learning (DL) models have been applied in RS
systems. However, in the past few years, most studies fo-
cused only on single EO sensors, such as HSI sensors, rather

acquired from different sensors can provide more rich spec-
tral information, it cannot differentiate the landcover objects
such as roads and roofs using the same materials [9]. In con-
trast, LiDAR provides elevation information that allows dis-
tinguishing objects with identical spectral signatures but dif-
ferent elevations, such as roads and roof built-in cement [10].
Multimodal data integration for RS classiﬁcation can a solu-
tion to the dilemma.
In recent years, DL methods have been widely used in
multimodal data fusion for RS image classiﬁcation [11, 12].
More recently, Vision Transformers (ViT) [13] using self-
attention considering the local-global context of an image
or image sequence has been becoming a new mainstream
for RS image classiﬁcation. SpectralFormer [14] learned the
spectral representation of neighboring bands using a cross-
layer encoder module of ViT. However, it neglected spatial
information and only uses spectral information. Swalpa et al.
proposed MFT [10] which incorporates HSI and other source
data to construct a multimodal ViT for RS image classiﬁca-
tion. Nevertheless, MFT did not consider the compatibility
problem when fusing the data with a large resolution gap
such as HSI and LiDAR data which may affect the land-
cover classiﬁcation in complex scenes [15]. To leverage the
complementary information between the different modalities,
we propose a multimodal transformer using self-attention
between two modalities HSI and LiDAR data for RS image
classiﬁcation. Instead of using a vanilla ViT as in MFT or
SpectralForm, we propose a Multi-scale Multi-head Self-
Attention (MSMHSA) using different heads of transformer
aiming to better fuse the feature representations with different
resolutions of heterogeneous data from different modalities.
Besides, we also introduce convolutions to our MMFormer
using Convolutional Tokenization to tokenize HSI and Li-
DAR rather than using linear projection to encode Q, K, V
feature maps for self-attention.
The main contributions of this paper can be summa-
rized as follows: 1) We design a Multimodal Transformer
(MMFormer) for RS image classiﬁcation using HSI and
LiDAR data. 2) A Multi-scale Multi-Head Self-AttentionarXiv:2303.13101v1  [cs.CV]  23 Mar 2023(MSMHSA) implemented on a single transformer allows
better fusing of multimodal data of different resolutions. 3)
The introduction of convolutions to MMFormer to integrate
desirable convolution proprieties. 4) The state-of-art per-
formance demonstrates that the proposed MMFormer can
serve as an effective new backbone for multimodal RS image
classiﬁcation.
2. RELATED WORKS
In the past few years, various traditional methods have been
investigated to extract more effective information from multi-
source RS data, such as random forest (RF), morphological
proﬁles (MPs) [16], attribute proﬁles (APs) [17], extinction
proﬁles (EPs) [18] and subspace learning [19]. Ham et al.
investigated hierarchical classiﬁers based on RF to improve
the generalization in analysis of quantity limited hyperspec-
tral data[20]. Recently, deep learning techniques have been
widely used in the task of multimodal data fusion for RS data
classiﬁcation and have shown excellent feature extraction
abilities. In [11], Makantasis et al. exploited a CNN2D based
network to encode pixels’ spectral and spatial information.
Vision Transformers methods used self-attention to learn the
local-global context of an HSI data. SpectralFormer [14]
used a cross-layer encoder module of ViT to learn the spec-
tral features between HSI bands. And Swalpa et al. proposed
MFT [10] which leverage the complementary information
between the different modalities to construct a multimodal
ViT for RS image classiﬁcation. Inspired by the former
methods, we propose a Multi-scale Multi-head Self-Attention
transformer to improve the overall fusion and classiﬁcation
accuracy.
3. METHODOLOGY
3.1. Overall Architecture
An overview of the proposed MMFormer is depicted in Fig-
ure 1. To balance the performance and the parameters of
model, we set the proposed transformer depth to 2.
Convolutional Tokenization . Unlike the vanilla Trans-
former, we use convolutional embedding instead of linear
projection to tokenize Q=K=V2RCAHAWAfeature
maps. Firstly, the 11*11 data cubes are padding to 16*16.
And sequential layers Conv3D [12] and HetConv2D [21] are
used to extract the feature map of HSI cube and reduce the
HSI spectral channels down to 64. A Conv2D layer is used
to extract LiDAR cube’s feature map and expend the band
to 64. After that, the feature maps, concatenated in the last
dimension, act as the input of convolutional embedding to get
theQ,KandV.
Then the obtained Q,KandVare fed into the MSMHSA
module to learn the local-global dependencies in the fu-sion data. In the output layer of MSMHSA module, we
also replace the linear layer and layer normalization with
a convolution layer(with kernel size = 3, padding = 1) and
a LeakyReLU activation function. The mentioned modules
could be deﬁned as follow:
Q;K;V=Conv 2D(Xin;k= (1;1)) (1)
(
Xout=Conv 2D(Xin;k= (3;3);p= (1;1))
X=LeakyReLU (Xout;0:2)(2)
The details of MSMHSA module are described in Section 3.2.
Finally, we add Feed-Forward Network (FFN) with Norm lay-
ers at the end of transformer. In this work, linear projection
layers in FFN are also replaced by convolution layers. As in
ViT [22], an MLP Head is connected to the transformer to
generate the classiﬁcation embeddings.
3.2. Multi-scale Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSMHSA)
The goal of MSMHSA, as shown in Figure 1(b), is to in-
troduce a pyramid structure into the self-attention module to
generate multi-scale feature maps which can employ pixel-
level ﬁne-grained feature fusion on the complimentary fea-
tures. The proposed MSMHSA is applied on different heads
of each layer of transformer. All the heads share the similar
protocol to calculate the self-attention.
In particular, the feature maps Q=K=Vare equally di-
vided to each head along the dimension before inputting them
to MSMHSA.
Given a transformer with three heads fed by input fea-
ture maps Q=K=Vof sizeCAHAWA, the feature
maps for each head are Qi=Ki=Vi2RCA
3HAWA. For
the ﬁrst head Head 1, we take a full-size patch q1=k1=v12

3HAWAto calculate a global self-attention feature
map for the ﬁrst head Head 1. We can obtain the self-
attention feature map h12RCA

i.e., using qi;m=ki;nfrom the neighborhood to calculate self-
attention, and global attention focusing on the global context

the image. Instead of adding an extra token as ViT for image
classiﬁcation, we learn a representation of a data sequence,
i.e., the output of MLP Head Z, based on all tokens with
cross-entropy loss to conduct ﬁnal landcover classiﬁcation in
this work.

LiDAR data contain 325 × 220 pixels. HSI initially contained
72 bands, however initial and ﬁnal four bands are removed
due to noise issues, the remaining 64 bands were used for the
experiment, and the LiDAR data contained 2 bands. There
are 11 different classes.
(2) Experimental Setup All the tests have been performed on
a CentOS Linux server(release 7.9.2009) and a single GPU,
Nvidia 3090 with 24576MB of VRAM.
A batch size of 64 and 500 has been used for training and
testing the performance of the considered models. The mod-
els have been trained with a Adam optimizer (learning rate =
5e-4, weight decay = 5e-3) and a step scheduler (step size = 50
and gamma = 0.9). Each experiment has been conducted us-
ing 500 epochs repeating 3 times and the average and standard
deviations are reported. The source code was implemented
using PyTorch 1.12.1 and Python 3.8.7.

4.2. Quantitative analysis
Table 1 and Table 2 report the quantitative OA, AA, kappa
and each class accuracy on two widely used datasets Trento
and MUUFL to compare the proposed MMFormer with other
state-of-art methods, i.e., RF [20], CNN2D [11], ViT [22],
SpectralFormer [14] and MFT [10]. Our model MMFormer
obtains the best performance on all three indices on both
two benchmarks, such as 99.18% and 94.73% OA, 97.91%
and 84.57% AA and 98.90% and 93.02% Kappa on Trento
and MUUFL datasets. Our model has also achieved the best
performance for almost each class accuracy, and even it has
gained 20% improvement on landcover Yellow-Curb (class
10 ) compared to the latest MFT on MUUFL data.

helps to learn the features in a ﬁne-to-coarse manner, which
obtains a classiﬁcation map with less noise and ﬁner details.

Effectiveness of multimodal fusion. In order to evaluate
the effectiveness of multimodal fusion, we trained the pro-
posed model respectively on single modality and multimodal-
ities. Only one branch has been used to input the data when
training the model in single modality as shown in Figure 1.
In Table 3, we can see that the performance of multimodal
model is superior to single-modal either HSI or LiDAR for
all three indices, i.e., OA, AA, and almost for each class
accuracy, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-
modal transformer MMFormer for RS image classiﬁcation.
Effectiveness of multi-scale MHSA. In Table 4, we can
see that the model using MSMHSA performs always better
than the one using single-scale MHSA, e.g., the model using
1616, 44, 22 gains 1%improvement in terms OA,AA, .
5. CONCLUSION
We design a Multimodal Transformer (MMFormer) which
enables us to explore the complementary information be-
tween spectral information in HSI and spatial information
in LiDAR for RS image classiﬁcation. The proposed Multi-
scale Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSMHSA) in Transformer
aims to better fuse the multimodal data with very different
resolutions. We also introduce convolutions to our model
to integrate desirable proprieties of CNNs which can gain a
good computation-accuracy balance. The effectiveness and
state-of-art performance demonstrate that the proposed MM-
Former can serve as a new valuable backbone for RS image
classiﬁcation.References
