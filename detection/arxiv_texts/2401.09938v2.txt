In this work we present an ab initio scheme based on linear response theory of exchange torque
correlation, implemented into the real-space Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (RS-KKR) framework to cal-
culate diagonal elements of the atomic-site-dependent intrinsic Gilbert damping tensor. The method
is first applied to bcc iron and fcc cobalt bulk systems. Beside reproducing earlier results from the
literature for those bulk magnets, the effect of the lattice compression is also studied for Fe bulk,
and significant changes for the Gilbert damping are found. Furthermore, (001)-oriented surfaces
of Fe and Co are also investigated. It is found that the on-site Gilbert damping increases in the
surface atomic layer and decreases in the subsurface layer, and approaches the bulk value moving
further inside the magnets. Realistic atomic relaxation of the surface layers enhances the identified
effects. Thefirst-neighbordampingparametersareextremelysensitivetothesurfacerelaxation. De-
spite their inhomogeneity caused by the surface, the transverse Gilbert damping tensor components
remain largely insensitive to the magnetization direction.
I. INTRODUCTION
It is highly demanded to understand and control
the dynamical processes governing the manipulation
of various magnetic textures, such as atomic chains1,2,
magnetic skyrmions3,4or domain walls5, which can
be potentially used in future magnetic recording and
logic devices. These processes are often described by
the phenomenological Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG)
equation6,7,

where ⃗ miis the magnetic moment at site i,mi=|⃗ mi|
is its length, and γis the gyromagnetic ratio. The

the second term is the Gilbert damping due to the
energy dissipation to the lattice. Clearly, this latter
term causes the relaxation of the magnetization to its
equilibrium value, which is controlled by the damping
constant αand plays a crucial role in the realization
of high-speed spintronic devices.
The Gilbert damping constant αcan be deter-
mined experimentally from the ferromagnetic reso-
nance (FMR) spectroscopy where the damping pa-
rameter is related to the line-width in the measured
spectra8. FMR spectroscopy is a well-established
method for bulk materials9,10, but especially in the
low temperature measurement it is controversial be-
cause the intrinsic Gilbert damping needs to be sepa-
rated from various extrinsic sources of the line-width,
e.g., two-magnon scattering, eddy-current damping,
radiative damping, spin-pumping, or the slow relaxer
mechanism11–16. The comparison of experimental
measurement to theoretical calculations is also made
difficult bythe sampleproperties likethe exactatomic
structure.From a theoretical perspective the ultimate goal is
to develop a method to calculate the Gilbert damp-
ing parameters from the electronic structure of the
material. In the last decades there have been sev-
eral efforts to understand the damping process. The
first successful method was developed by Kamberský
whorelatedthedampingprocesstothespin-orbitcou-
pling (SOC) in terms of the breathing Fermi surface
model17, while he also proposed the spin-orbit torque
correlation model18,19. Later on several other meth-
ods were introduced such as the spin-pumping20and
linear-response approaches11,21,22. A recent summary
of these methods was published by Guimarães et al.23
Due to the increased interest in noncollinear mag-
netism Fähnle et al.24suggested an inhomogeneous
tensorial damping. The replacement of a scalar αby
a damping matrix αmeans that the damping field in
Eq.(1)isnolongerproportionaltothetimederivative
of⃗ mi, it becomes a linear function of ∂ ⃗ mi/∂t. More-
over, nonlocality of the damping process implies that
the damping field at site iexperiences ∂ ⃗ mj/∂tfor any
sitej. The LLG equation (1) is then replaced by the
set of equations25,

where the damping term is unfolded to pairwise con-
tributions of strength αij. The appearance of non-
local damping terms was evidenced for magnetic do-
main walls26,27by linking the Gilbert damping to the
gradients of the magnetization. In NiFe, Co, and
CoFeB thin films Li et al.28measured wave-number-
dependent dissipation using perpendicular spin wave
resonance, validating thus the idea of nonlocal damp-
ing terms. Different analytical expressions for αijare
already proposed22,25,29,30, and the nonlocal damp-
ing is found for bulk materials25,31as well as its ef-arXiv:2401.09938v2  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  28 Feb 20242
fect on magnon properties of ferromagnets have been
discussed32. Recent studies went further and, anal-
ogously to the higher order spin-spin interactions in
spin models, introduced multi-body contributions to
the Gilbert damping33.
The calculation of the Gilbert damping prop-
erties of materials has so far been mostly fo-
cused on 3D bulk magnets, either in chemically
homogeneous11,19,23,25,34–36or heterogeneous (e.g.
alloyed)11,22,31forms. There are a few studies avail-
able reporting on the calculation of the Gilbert damp-
ing in 2D magnetic thin films12,23,37,38, or at surfaces
and interfaces of 3D magnets31,35,37. The calculation
of the Gilbert damping in 1D or 0D magnets is, due
to our knowledge, not reported in the literature. Fol-
lowing the trend of approaching the atomic scale for
functional magnetic elements in future spintronic de-
vices, the microscopic understanding of energy dissi-
pation through spin dynamics in magnets of reduced
dimensions is inevitable and proper theoretical meth-
ods have to be developed.
Our present work proposes a calculation tool for
thediagonalelementsofthenon-localintrinsicGilbert
damping tensor covering the 3D to 0D range of mag-
netic materials on an equal footing, employing a real-
space embedding Green’s function technique39. For
this purpose, the linear response theory of the Gilbert
damping obtained by the exchange torque correlation
is implemented in the real-space KKR method. As a
demonstration of the new method, elemental Fe and
Co magnets in their 3D bulk form and their (001)-
oriented surfaces are studied in the present work. Go-
ing beyond comparisons with the available literature,
new aspects of the Gilbert damping in these materials
are also reported.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the
calculation of the Gilbert damping parameters within
the linear response theory of exchange torque corre-
lation using the real-space KKR formalism is given.
Sec. III reports our results on bulk bcc Fe and fcc Co
materials and their (001)-oriented surfaces. We draw
our conclusions in Sec. IV.

The multiple-scattering of electrons in a finite clus-
ter consisting of NCatoms embedded into a 3D or 2D

where τCand τHare the scattering path operator

respectively, tCandtHare the corresponding single-

and for simplicity we dropped the energy-dependence
of the above matrices.
For calculating the diagonal Cartesian elements
of the nonlocal Gilbert damping tensor connecting

stricted to the spinor spherical harmonics only22. We
should emphasize that Eq. (4) applies to the diagonal
(µµ) elements of the Gilbert tensor only. To calcu-
late the off-diagonal tensor elements one needs to use,
e.g., the more demanding Kubo-Bastin formula40,41.
Note also that in noncollinear magnets the exchange
field Bxc(⃗ r)is sensitive to the spin noncollinearity42
which influences the calculated torque operator ma-
trix elements, however, this aspect does not concern
our present study including collinear magnetic states
only.

In practice, the Gilbert damping formula in Eq. (4)
is not directly evaluated at the Fermi energy, but a
small imaginary part ( η) of the complex energy is ap-
plied, which is called broadening in the following, and
its physical effect is related to the scattering rate in
other damping theories19,25,37,43. Taking into account

tems and their (001)-oriented surfaces with C4vsym-

the site-nonlocal spatial point of view in this work we
present results on the on-site (" 00"), first neighbor
(denoted by " 01") and second neighbor (denoted by
"02") Gilbert damping parameters, and an effective,
so-called total Gilbert damping ( αtot), which can be
defined as the Fourier transform of αjkat⃗ q= 0. The
Fourier transform of the Gilbert damping reads
α⃗ q=∞X
j=0α0jexp(−i⃗ q(⃗ r0−⃗ rj))
≈X
r0j≤rmaxα0jexp(−i⃗ q(⃗ r0−⃗ rj)),(8)
where r0j=|⃗ r0−⃗ rj|and the effective damping is
defined as
αtot=α⃗ q=⃗0=∞X
j=0α0j≈X
r0j≤rmaxα0j.(9)
Since we have a real-space implementation of the
Gilbert damping, the infinite summation for both
quantities is replaced by an approximative summation
for neighboring atoms upto an rmaxcutoff distance
measured from site "0". Moreover, note that for bulk
systems the effective damping αtotis directly related
to the ⃗ q= 0mode of FMR experiments.
The accuracy of the calculations depends on many
numerical parameters such as the number of ⃗kpoints
used in the Brillouin zone integration, the choice of
the angular momentum cutoff ℓmax, and the spatial
cutoff rmaxused for calculating α⃗ qandαtot. Previ-
ous research25showed that the Gilbert damping heav-
ily depends on the broadening η, so we extended ourstudies to a wider range of η= 1meV to 1 eV. The
sufficient k-point sampling was tested at the distance
ofrmax= 7a0(where a0is the corresponding 2D lat-
tice constant) from the reference site with the broad-
ening set to 1mRy, and the number of ⃗kpoints was
increased up to the point, where the 5th digit of the
damping became stable. Maximally, 320400 ⃗kpoints
were used for the 2D layered calculation but the re-
quested accuracy was reached with 45150 and 80600
⃗kpoints for bulk bcc Fe and fcc Co systems, respec-
tively.
The choice of ℓmaxwas tested through the whole η
range for bcc Fe, and it was based on the comparison
of damping calculations with ℓmax= 2andℓmax= 3.
The maximal deviation for the on-site Gilbert damp-
ing was found at around η= 5mRy, but it was still
less than 10%. The first and second neighbor Gilbert
damping parameters changed in a more significant
way (by ≈50%) in the whole ηrange upon changing
ℓmax, yet the effective total damping was practically
unchanged, suggesting that farther nonlocal damping
contributions compensate this effect. Since αtotis the
measurable physical quantity we concluded that the
lower angular momentum cutoff of ℓmax= 2is suffi-
cient to be used further on.
The above choice of ℓmax= 2for the angular mo-
mentumcutoff, themathematicalcriterionofpositive-
definite αjk(which implies α⃗ q>0for all ⃗ qvectors),
and the prescribed accuracy for the effective Gilbert
damping in the full considered η= 1meV to 1 eV
range set rmaxto 20 a0for both bcc Fe and fcc Co. It
is worth mentioning that the consideration of lattice
symmetries made possible to decrease the number of
atomic sites in the summations for calculating α⃗ qand
αtotby an order of magnitude.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Our newly implemented method was employed to
study the Gilbert damping properties of Fe and Co
ferromagnetsintheirbulkand(001)-orientedsurfaces.
In these cases only unperturbed host atoms form
the atomic cluster, and the so-called self-embedding
procedure44is employed, where Eq. (3) reduces to
τC=τHforthe3Dbulkmetalsand2Dlayeredmetal-
vacuum interfaces.
A. Bulk Fe and Co ferromagnets
First we calculate and analyze the nonlocal and ef-
fective dampings for bulk bcc Fe by choosing a 2D
lattice constant of a0= 2.863Å. The magnitude of
the magnetic moments are obtained from the self-
consistent calculation. The spin and orbital moments
arems= 2.168µBandmo= 0.046µB, respectively.
The broadening is set to η= 68meV. The inset of Fig.
1a) shows the typical function of the nonlocal Gilbert
damping α0jdepending on the normalized distance
r0j/a0between atomic sites "0" and " j". In accor-
dance with Ref. 25 the nonlocal Gilbert damping
quickly decays to zero with the distance, and can be4

well approximated with the following function:
α(r)≈Asin (kr+ϕ0)
r2exp(−βr).(10)
To test this assumption we assorted the atomic sites
lying in the [110] crystallographic direction and fit-
ted Eq. (10) to the calculated data. In practice, the
fit is made on the data set of α0j(r0j/a0)2, and is
plotted in Fig. 1a). Although there are obvious out-
liers in the beginning, the magnitude of the Gilbert
damping asymptotically follows the ∝exp(−βr)/r2
distance dependence. The physical reason for this de-
cay is the appearance of two scattering path operators
(Green’s functions) in the exchange torque correlation
formula in Eq. (4) being broadened due to the finite
imaginary part of the energy argument.
In our real-space implementation of the Gilbert
damping, an important parameter for the effective
damping calculation is the real-space cutoff rmaxin
Eq. (9). Fig. 1b) shows the evolution of the ef-
fective (total) damping depending on the rmaxdis-
tance, within which all nonlocal damping terms α0jare summed up according to Eq. (9). An oscillation
can similarly be detected as for the nonlocal damping
itself in Fig. 1a), and this behavior was fitted with
a similar exponentially decaying oscillating function
as reported in Eq. (10) in order to determine the ex-
pected total Gilbert damping αtotvalue in the asymp-
totic r→ ∞limit. In the total damping case it is
found that the spatial decay of the oscillation is much
slower compared to the nonlocal damping case, which
makes the evaluation of αtotmore cumbersome. Our
detailed studies evidence that for different broaden-
ingηvalues the wavelength of the oscillation stays
the same but the spatial decay becomes slower as
the broadening is decreased (not shown). This slower
decay together with the fact that the effective (to-
tal) damping value itself is also decreasing with the
decreasing broadening results that below the 10meV
range of ηthe amplitude of the oscillation at the dis-
tance of 20 a0is much larger than its asymptotic limit.
In practice, since the total damping is calculated as
ther→ ∞limit of such a curve as shown in Fig. 1b),
this procedure brings an increased error for αtotbelow
η= 10meV, and this error could only be reduced by
increasing the required number of atomic sites in the
real-space summation in Eq. (10).
Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the calculated on-
site, first- and second-neighbor and effective total
Gilbert damping parameters on the broadening η.
The left column shows on-site ( α00) and total ( αtot)
while the right one the first ( α01) and second ( α02)
neighbor Gilbert dampings. We find very good agree-
ment with the earlier reported results of Thonig et
al.25, particularly that the on-site damping has the
largest contribution to the total damping being in the
same order of magnitude, while the first and second
neighbors are smaller by an order of magnitude. The
obtained dependence on ηis also similar to the one
published by Thonig et al.25:α00andαtotare in-
creasing with η, and α01andα02do not follow a
common trend, and they are material-dependent, see,
e.g., the opposite trend of α02with respect to ηfor
Fe and Co. The observed negative values of some of
thesite-nonlocaldampingsarestillconsistentwiththe
positive-definiteness of the full (infinite) αjkmatrix,
which has also been discussed in Ref. 25.
The robustness of the results was tested against a
small change of the lattice constant simulating the ef-
fect of an external pressure for the Fe bulk. These re-
sults are presented in the second row of Fig. 2, where
the lattice constant of Fe is set to a0= 2.789Å. In this
case the magnetic moments decrease to ms= 2.066µB
andmo= 0.041µB. It can clearly be seen that the on-
site, first and second neighbor Gilbert dampings be-
come smaller upon the assumed 2.5% decrease of the
lattice constant, but the total damping remains prac-
tically unchanged in the studied ηrange. This sug-
gests that the magnitudes of more distant non-local
damping contributions are increased.
The third row of Fig. 2 shows the selected damp-
ing results for fcc Co with a 2D lattice constant of
a0= 2.507Å. The spin and orbital moments are
ms= 1.654µBandmo= 0.078µB, respectively. The

dampings with increasing ηis similar to the Fe case,
and the on-site term dominates αtot. An obvious
difference is found for the second-neighbor damping,
which behaves as an increasing function of ηfor Co
unlike it is found for Fe.
Concerning the calculated damping values, there is
a large variety of theoretical methods and calculation
parameters, as well as experimental setups used in
the literature, which makes ambiguous to compare
our results with others. Recently, Miranda et al.31
reported a comparison of total and on-site damping
values with the available theoretical and experimen-
tal literature in their Table S1. For bcc Fe bulk they
reported total damping values in the range of 1.3–
4.2×10−3and for fcc Co bulk within the range of 3.2–
11×10−3, and our results fit very well within theseranges around η≈100meV for Fe and for η >100
meV for Co. Moreover, we find that our calculated on-
site damping values for bcc Fe are larger ( >5×10−3)
than the reported values of Miranda et al.(1.6×10−3
and 3.6 ×10−3), but for fcc Co the agreement with
their reported total (3.2 ×10−3) and on-site damping
(5.3×10−3) values is very good at our η= 136meV
broadening value.

Next, weinvestigatethespin-orbit-coupling-(SOC)-

methodmakesitinherentlypossibletoincludeaSOC-
scaling factor in the calculations45. Fig. 3 shows the
obtained total Gilbert damping as a function of the
broadening ηwith SOC switched on/off for bcc Fe
and fcc Co. It can be seen that the effect of SOC
is not dominant at larger ηvalues, but the SOC
has an important contribution at small broadening
values ( η < 10−2eV), where the calculated total
Gilbert damping values begin to deviate from each
other with/without SOC. As discussed in Ref. 23,
without SOC the damping should go toward zero for
zero broadening, which is supported by our results
shown in Fig. 3.
B. (001)-oriented surfaces of Fe and Co
ferromagnets
In the following, we turn to the investigation of the
Gilbertdampingparametersatthe(001)-orientedsur-
faces of bcc Fe and fcc Co. Both systems are treated
as a semi-infinite ferromagnet interfaced with a semi-
infinite vacuum within the layered SKKR method46.
In the interface region 9 atomic layers of the ferromag-
net and 3 atomic layers of vacuum are taken, which is
sandwiched between the two semi-infinite (ferromag-
net and vacuum) regions. Two types of surface atomic
geometries were calculated: (i) all atomic layers hav-
ing the bulk interlayer distance, and (ii) the surface
and subsurface atomic layers of the ferromagnets have6

Figure 4 shows the calculated layer-resolved on-
site and first-neighbor Gilbert damping values (with
η= 0.68eV broadening) for the bcc Fe(001) and fcc
Co(001) surfaces. It can generally be stated that the
surface effects are significant in the first 4 atomic lay-
ers of Fe and in the first 3 atomic layers of Co. We
find that the on-site damping ( α00) increases above
the bulk value in the surface atomic layer (layer 1:
L1), and decreases below the bulk value in the sub-
surface atomic layer (L2) for both Fe and Co. This
finding is interesting since the spin magnetic moments
(ms, shown in the insets of Fig. 4) are also consider-
ably increased compared to their bulk values in the
surface atomic layer (L1), and the spin moment enters
the denominator when calculating the damping in Eq.
(4).α00increases again in L3 compared to its value in
L2, thus it exhibits a nonmonotonic layer-dependence
in the vicinity of the surface. The damping results ob-
tained with the ideal bulk interlayer distances and the
relaxed surface geometry ("R") are also compared in
Fig. 4. It can be seen that the on-site damping is in-
creasedinthesurfaceatomiclayer(L1), anddecreased
in the subsurface (L2) and sub-subsurface (L3) atomic
layers upon atomic relaxation ("R") for both Fe and
Co. The first-neighbor dampings ( α01) are of two
types for the bcc Fe(001) and three types for the fcc
Co(001), see caption of Fig. 4. All damping values
are approaching their corresponding bulk value mov-
ing closer to the semi-infinite bulk (toward L9). In
absolute terms, for both Fe and Co the maximal sur-
face effect is about 10−3for the on-site damping, and
2×10−4for the first-neighbor dampings. Given the
damping values, the maximal relative change is about
15% for the on-site damping, and the first-neighbor
dampings can vary by more than 100% (and can even
changesign)inthevicinityofthesurfaceatomiclayer.
Note that Thonig and Henk35studied layer-resolved
(effective) damping at the surface of fcc Co within the
breathing Fermi surface model combined with a tight-
binding electronic structure approach. Although they
studied a different quantity compared to us, they also
reported an increased damping value in the surface
atomic layer, followed by an oscillatory decay toward
bulk Co.
So far the presented Gilbert damping results cor-
respond to spin moments pointing to the crystallo-

01FIG. 4. Evolution of the layer-resolved Gilbert damping
from the surface atomic layer (L1) of bcc Fe(001) and fcc
Co(001) toward the bulk (L9), depending also on the out-
of-plane atomic relaxation "R". On-site ( α00) and first
neighbor ( α01) Gilbert damping values are shown in the
top two and bottom two panels, respectively. The broad-
ening is η= 0.68eV. The empty symbols belong to the
calculations with the ideal bulk interlayer distances, and
the full symbols to the relaxed surface geometry, denoted
with index "R". Note that α01is calculated for nearest
neighbors of atomic sites in the neighboring upper, lower,
and the same atomic layer (for fcc Co only), and they are
respectively denoted by " +" (L-(L+1)), " −" (L-(L −1)),
and no extra index (L-L). The insets in the top two panels
show the evolution of the magnitudes of the layer-resolved
spin magnetic moments ms. The horizontal dashed line in
all cases denotes the corresponding bulk value.
graphic [001] ( z) direction, and the transverse compo-
nents of the damping αxxandαyyare equivalent due
tothe C4vsymmetryofthe(001)-orientedsurfaces. In
order to study the effect of a different orientation of
all spin moments on the transverse components of the
damping, we also performed calculations with an ef-
fective field pointing along the in-plane ( x) direction:
[100] for bcc Fe and [110] for fcc Co. In this case, due
to symmetry breaking of the surface one expects an
anisotropy in the damping, i.e., that the transverse
components of the damping tensor, αyyandαzz, are
not equivalent any more. According to our calcula-7
tions, however, the two transverse components of the
on-site ( αyy
00andαzz
00) and nearest-neighbor ( αyy
01and
αzz
01) damping tensor, at the Fe surface differed by less
than 0.1 % and at the Co surface by less than 0.2 %,
i.e., despite the presence of the surface the damping
tensor remained highly isotropic. The change of the
damping with respect to the orientation of the spin
moments in zorxdirection (damping anisotropy)
turned out to be very small as well: the relative dif-
ference in αyy
00was 0.1 % and 0.3 %, while 0.5 % and
0.1 % in αyy
01for the Fe and the Co surfaces, respec-
tively. For the farther neighbors, this difference was
less by at least two orders of magnitude.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
We implemented an ab initio scheme of calculat-
ing diagonal elements of the atomic-site-dependent
Gilbert damping tensor based on linear response the-
ory of exchange torque correlation into the real-space
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) framework. To val-
idate the method, damping properties of bcc Fe and
fcc Co bulk ferromagnets are reproduced in good com-
parison with the available literature. The lattice com-
pression is also studied for Fe bulk, and important
changes for the Gilbert damping are found, most pro-
nounced for the site-nonlocal dampings. By investi-
gating (001)-oriented surfaces of ferromagnetic Fe andCo, we point out substantial variations of the layer-
resolved Gilbert damping in the vicinity of the sur-
faces depending on various investigated parameters.
The effect of such inhomogeneous dampings should be
included into future spin dynamics simulations aim-
ing at an improved accuracy, e.g., for 2D surfaces and
interfaces. We anticipate that site-nonlocal damping
effects become increasingly important when moving
toward physical systems with even more reduced di-
mensions (1D).
