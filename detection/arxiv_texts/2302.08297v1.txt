Abstract — Ultrasound imaging is the most popular medical
imaging modality for point-of-care bedside imaging. However,
2D ultrasound imaging provides only limited views of the
organ of interest, making diagnosis challenging. To overcome
this, 3D ultrasound imaging was developed, which uses 2D
ultrasound images and their orientation/position to reconstruct
3D volumes. The accurate position estimation of the ultrasound
probe at low cost has always stood as a challenging task in
3D reconstruction. In this study, we propose a novel approach
of using a mechanical track for ultrasound scanning, which
restricts the probe motion to a linear plane, simplifying the
acquisition and hence the reconstruction process. We also
present an end-to-end pipeline for 3D ultrasound volume
reconstruction and demonstrate its efﬁcacy with an in-vitro
tube phantom study and an ex-vivo bone experiment. The
comparison between a sensorless freehand and the proposed
mechanical track based acquisition is available online
(shorturl.at/jqvX0).
Clinical relevance — The proposed approach simpliﬁes the
process of 3D ultrasound acquisition and reconstruction and has
the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and precision
of point-of-care ultrasound imaging.
I. INTRODUCTION
Ultrasound imaging is a popular point-of-care medical
imaging modality due to its several advantages such as
dynamic imaging, lack of ionizing radiations, comparatively
low cost, and easy disinfection. However, conventional 2D
ultrasound imaging suffers many disadvantages [1]. The most
important is that the decision-making process in diagnosis
and analysis is time-consuming and might lead to inac-
curate judgments. This is because the physician needs to
mentally transform a sequence of 2D ultrasound images to
produce a 3D volume representation. Also, it is challenging
to relocate the exact orientation of any previously captured
image to record the progression and regression of pathology
in response to therapy. Measurement of an organ volume,
which is very important in some treatments and surgery, is
highly inaccurate in 2D ultrasound imaging. Due to these
limitations of 2D ultrasound imaging, there is a growing need
for 3D ultrasound imaging, which provides more precise and
integrated information about organs and is better suited for
treatment and clinical diagnosis [2].
Various ultrasound data acquisition methods using 2D
arrays and mechanical 3D probes have been developed over

and Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology
Palakkad, Kerala, Indiathe years. Using a dedicated 2D array ultrasound probe is one
of the fastest ways to view the 3D volume in real-time as it
does not require precise orientation information for volume
generation [3]. But a 2D array probe is costly and complex
to design in terms of both hardware and software. Moreover
the limited size of 2D array transducers, due to difﬁculties in
fabrication, results in a smaller ﬁeld of view in imaging [1].
In a mechanical 3D probe, a standard linear array transducer
is motored to translate, rotate and tilt within the probe to
acquire images, and the translation, rotation, and axis of ro-
tation can be used as a reference for reconstruction. However,
the mechanical 3D probes need to be held statically by the
doctors while images are being taken, which introduces latent
ﬂaws in the data-collecting process [4]. Another method uses
motorized mechanisms to tilt or translate the conventional
linear array probe and rapidly acquire 2D ultrasound images
[5]. Here the scanning position and orientation need to be
predeﬁned and are controlled by a stepper/servo motor, hence
it acquires regularly spaced 2D ultrasound frames. However,
these motorised probes are bulky, making them inconvenient
for frequent scanning purposes [4].
In freehand ultrasound acquisition, orientation estima-
tion sensors like electromagnetic (EM) tracking sensors are
attached to the ultrasound probe to register the orienta-
tion/position of each frame along with the ultrasound frame.
This method allows the user to move the probe freely,
making it more ﬂexible in terms of mobility [6]. However,
EM trackers can be affected by interference from nearby
magnetic sources, resulting in decreased tracking accuracy
[1]. Deep learning-based sensor-less freehand ultrasound 3D
reconstruction [7] techniques have gained popularity in the
recent past. But the deep learning-based approach requires
a lot of labelled training samples and high computational
power for accurate results [8]. Also, in general, most of the
approaches in literature have been proposed to enable 3D
scanning on a moderately high-cost system not intended for
point-of-care imaging.
In this work, a novel approach to overcome the challenge
of orientation/position estimation in freehand-based scanning
is attempted by using a low-cost mechanical track that
simpliﬁes position tracking using a predeﬁned movement
region. Interpolation techniques are utilized to reconstruct the
acquired data into a 3D volume, which can then be visualized
through volume rendering.arXiv:2302.08297v1  [eess.IV]  16 Feb 2023This is an originally submitted version and has not been reviewed by independent peers.

II. P ROPOSED APPROACH
A. Proposed Mechanical Track
The use of a mechanical track for probe motion in 3D
acquisition simpliﬁes position tracking by conﬁning the
probe to linear motion in a plane. The mechanical track
consists of two components: the probe mask, which reduces
errors in linear scanning by preventing the probe from tilting,
and the rectangular track, which serves as a guide rail for the
smooth movement of the probe and prevents slipping from
the operator’s hands. The mechanical track, designed using
Fusion 360 software (Fig. 1(i) & (ii)) to match the probe
and scanning material, is 3D printed (Fig. 1(iv) & (v)) and
is cost-effective. The Verasonics L11-5v probe (Fig. 1(iii))
is used in the proposed study. The track width is selected
to guarantee seamless mask mobility. A curved bottom of
the mask matching the probe shape is designed to ensure
a snug ﬁt (Fig. 1(vi) & (vii)) and prevents the vertical
falling of the probe. Side cuts on the mask are provided to
accommodate the probe protrusions. Table I summarizes the
dimensions of the designed track and mask. The frames are
acquired at high frame rates employing multi-angle plane-
wave compounding which results in a high correlation among
the acquired frames. This leads to low-complex 3D volume
reconstruction using simple trilinear interpolation between
frames, simplifying the volume reconstruction process and
reducing computational complexity.B. Proposed Image Processing Pipeline
Ultrasound images are typically characterized by speckles
and hence the selection of image processing algorithms is a
crucial stage in the reconstruction pipeline. The various steps
in the proposed image processing pipeline are shown in Fig.
2 and explained in detail in the subsequent sections.
1) Log Compression and Squaring: Log compression
enhances the low-intensity values in images with strong
reﬂections. Squaring the image increases contrast by inten-
sifying the dark areas and brightening the bright regions.
The improvement in the visibility of the acquired ultrasound
images is illustrated in Fig. 2 (b).
2) Median ﬁltering: Due to the log compression, the salt
and pepper noise is increased and to suppress the same, a
non-linear median ﬁlter was applied. A 3 3 overlapping
window was employed for median ﬁltering in this work,
resulting in the ﬁltered image shown in Fig. 2 (c).
3) Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization: To
further enhance the image quality, contrast limited adaptive
histogram equalisation (CLAHE) [9], a variant of adaptive
histogram equalisation is applied, that distributes the part
of the histogram that exceeds the clip limit equally across
all histograms to limit the contrast ampliﬁcation to reduce
ampliﬁed noise as demonstrated in Fig. 2 (d).
4) Thresholding: The next step is to segment the relevant
region of interest. The initial step is to convert the image to
binary using global thresholding (using a threshold value of
49 here), and the binary image is shown in Fig. 2 (e).
5) Morphological Operations: The morphological closing
operation is performed on the thresholded image using a
cross-shaped structuring element of size 3 3 and the result
is shown in Fig. 2 (f).
6) Largest Contour Detection: The contours in an image
are lines that outline objects or features with similar intensity
levels. The Suzuki algorithm [10] is employed to detect
all the contours present in the binary image. The detected
contours are sorted based on the area, with the largest one notThis is an originally submitted version and has not been reviewed by independent peers.

7) Hough Transform: Since the objective of the tube
phantom study is to extract objects which are cylindrical in
nature, the Hough Transform [11] is employed to determine
the best-ﬁtting circle for the largest contour identiﬁed in each
frame as shown in Fig. 2 (h).
8) Segmentation: The region enclosed by the identiﬁed
circle is used as a binary mask and is then applied on the
histogram equalised image to produce the ﬁnal segmented
image in Fig. 2 (i).
C. 3D Reconstruction and Visualisation
After processing the data, the segmented ultrasound im-
ages of the cross-sectional view are obtained and will be
employed for the volume reconstruction. The reconstruction
was performed using the trilinear interpolation method. It
increases the resolution of the dataset by estimating intensity
values for voxels that were not present in the original
data, resulting in improved quality and detail of the ﬁnal
volume, leading to more accurate diagnosis and reduced
visual artefacts. Since the acquisition is done at high frame
rates with subsequent frames having high correlation, tri-
linear interpolation is a suitable approach for effectively
reconstructing the 3D volumes in the proposed work.
The reconstructed ultrasound volume dataset is visualized
using the volume rendering approach available in the V olume
Viewer tool in Matlab®, providing the three-dimensional
structure of the tube. The algorithm traces rays from the
viewpoint to each voxel in the volume and uses the intensity
values of corresponding 2D images to determine the voxel’s
colour and opacity. This generates a realistic 3D represen-
tation of the ultrasound data, giving a more comprehensive
understanding of the underlying structures.
III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
A. In-vitro Tube Phantom Study
The proposed approach was evaluated by reconstructing
the 3D volume of a circular tube from the 2D ultrasoundimages acquired using the proposed mechanical track. A
single-tube phantom was designed as shown in Fig. 3 (a),
and ﬁlled with a mixture of acoustic gel and chalk powder
to act as a reﬂector. The tube was positioned in a cubic
container ﬁlled with water to the top, ensuring that the tip of
the probe touches water, thus ensuring impedance matching.
The images were acquired using the 128-channel Verasonics
Vantage research ultrasound platform with an L11-5v lin-
ear probe. Plane-wave transmission at a center frequency
of 7 :6MHz is employed for insoniﬁcation and the delay
and sum beamformer on the Verasonics vantage system is
adopted for receive beamforming and image reconstruction.
A total of 150 beamformed grayscale images, each with
dimensions of 100 128 pixels, were acquired with a single
motion of the probe along the entire length of the mechanical
track.
B. 3D Volume Visualisation and Evaluation
The reconstructed volume visualized in MATLAB is
shown in Fig. 3 (c), with XY,Y ZandXZslices displayed in
Fig. 3 (d), (e), and (f) respectively. The XYslice represents
the cross-sectional view of the tube, the tube was kept at a
slant of 45so the Y Zslice gave an oval shape and the XZ
slice gives the top view of the phantom made.
The proposed auto segmentation is compared against the
manual segmentation for 20 random samples from the image
stack. The mean Intersection over Union (IoU) score between
manual and automatic segmentation was determined to be
88.97%. As seen in Fig. 3 (g) and (h), the results demonstrate
the high degree of similarity between manual and automatic
segmentation.
C. Ex-vivo Validation
The proposed approach is validated with an ex-vivo exper-
iment using a bone (tibia of a goat) placed in a water bath
as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). A total of 300 beamformed
grayscale images, each with dimensions of 128 128 pixels,
were acquired with a single motion of the probe along
the entire length of the mechanical track. The images areThis is an originally submitted version and has not been reviewed by independent peers.

processed similarly to that of the in-vitro study and the results
are shown in Fig. 4(d).
IV. D ISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this work, a novel framework for freehand scanning for
3D ultrasound imaging is proposed. The proposed approach
consists of a 3D-printed mechanical track and a high frame
rate acquisition. While the mechanical track ensured reduced
errors caused by probe slippage or tilt while scanning,
the high frame rate acquisition resulted in a high corre-
lation among subsequent frames which helped in simpler
approaches for volume reconstruction. The reconstructed
volume of the in-vitro tube phantom and the ex-vivo bone
phantom, shown in Fig. 3(b) and 4(c) respectively, were
generated using ultrasound images obtained without the use
of a mechanical track. Comparing these volumes with that
obtained using the mechanical track (Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 4(d))
highlights the reduction in errors caused by probe slippage
or tilt by incorporating the mechanical track in the imaging
process. Detailed video results comparing 3D reconstruction
with and without the use of the mechanical track are available
online [12].The proposed design is most effective for scanning on ﬂat
surfaces and can be improved by using a deformable material
on the side that comes into contact with the scanning surface.
To overcome errors due to variations in scanning velocity,
a low-cost accelerometer can be employed for tracking
probe motion and will be taken up as future work. While
conventional segmentation techniques produced good results
for the simple phantoms, neural network based segmentation
techniques shall be employed for more complex structures
as part of future work. Overall, the experimental results are
encouraging and suggest that further research is warranted
to address the current limitations to improve point-of-care
ultrasound imaging.
