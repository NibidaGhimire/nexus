Abstract
In this paper, a multiscale constitutive framework for one-dimensional blood
flow modeling is presented and discussed. By analyzing the asymptotic limits of
the proposed model, it is shown that different types of blood propagation phenom-
ena in arteries and veins can be described through an appropriate choice of scaling
parameters, which are related to distinct characterizations of the fluid-structure
interaction mechanism (whether elastic or viscoelastic) that exist between vessel
walls and blood flow. In these asymptotic limits, well-known blood flow models
from the literature are recovered. Additionally, by analyzing the perturbation of
the local elastic equilibrium of the system, a new viscoelastic blood flow model
is derived. The proposed approach is highly flexible and suitable for studying
the human cardiovascular system, which is composed of vessels with high mor-
phological and mechanical variability. The resulting multiscale hyperbolic model
of blood flow is solved using an asymptotic-preserving Implicit-Explicit Runge-
Kutta Finite Volume method, which ensures the consistency of the numerical
scheme with the different asymptotic limits of the mathematical model without
affecting the choice of the time step by restrictions related to the smallness of
the scaling parameters. Several numerical tests confirm the validity of the pro-
posed methodology, including a case study investigating the hemodynamics of a
thoracic aorta in the presence of a stent.

1 Introduction
The modeling of blood flow has undergone considerable development in recent years
thanks to the interest of numerous researchers who have expanded its treatment, fo-
cusing on various fundamental aspects and issues, in order to arrive at an increasingly
reliable description of the hemodynamics of the circulatory system [19, 38].
Several studies have already shown that, in general, one-dimensional (1D) modeling
coupled with lumped-parameter, zero-dimensional (0D) models, derived from full three-
dimensional (3D) models by means of simplifying assumptions about flow, structure,
and their interaction, is sufficient to obtain realistic and accurate numerical results,
2particularly when the flow is predominantly unidirectional [47, 34, 45]. Moreover, in
contrast to 3D simulations with prohibitively high computational costs, 1D models
allow for the investigation of the hemodynamics of the entire main circulatory system
[1, 32, 35].
One of the challenges presented by the modeling of the cardiovascular system is that
blood vessels exhibit high morphological and mechanical variability, interacting with
the blood flow to give rise to complex fluid-structure interactions (FSI). Moreover, in
unhealthy cases, this variability is further emphasized due to the possible presence of
calcifications, stenosis, aneurysms, or even prostheses such as grafts or stents [18, 41, 40].
To model the FSI occurring between blood and vessel walls, an appropriate constitutive
model, which relates pressure to area variations, needs to be considered. To this end,
it must be remembered that the smooth muscle cells that constitute the intermediate
layer of vessels impart a viscoelastic behavior to the wall, which assumes a key role
when high frequencies are dominant [2, 13]. In contrast, when stress is applied very
slowly, viscous aspects do not occur, and the wall behaves mostly elastically. Although
vessel viscosity is often neglected in blood flow models for simplicity, there is a growing
number of contributions showing the advantages of modeling the mechanical behavior
of the vessel wall using a viscoelastic rheological characterization, based on linear or
quasilinear viscoelasticity or more complex nonlinear models [44, 2, 20, 8].
In this complex setting, the paper aims to extend the treatment of the blood flow
model first presented in [5], providing a multiscale framework of 1D blood flow modeling
with a viscoelastic constitutive characterization of vessel walls. Indeed, by analyzing the
asymptotic limits of the system, it will be shown that by adopting a linear viscoelastic
constitutive relation of the Standard Linear Solid type, the proposed model can lead
to a very flexible and accurate description of many possible mechanical behaviors of
vessel walls, recovering different characterizations (e.g., the purely elastic model and
other widely used linear viscoelastic models) with an appropriate choice of the scaling
parameters involved. In addition, a new viscoelastic constitutive model will be derived
by analyzing the perturbation of the local elastic equilibrium of the system. From a
numerical point of view, a third order asymptotic-preserving (AP) Implicit-Explicit
(IMEX) Runge-Kutta Finite Volume scheme is considered, which ensures consistency
of the numerical method in all the asymptotic limits of the model (i.e., AP property)
and whose time step size is not affected by the smallness of the scaling parameters.
The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2, all modeling is pre-
sented and discussed, with emphasis toward the viscoelastic rheological characterization
of vessel walls and the analysis of the asymptotic limits of the proposed augmented blood
flow model. Section 4 is devoted to the presentation of the chosen numerical scheme
and the proof of the fundamental AP property, together with the implementation of
boundary conditions. In Section 5, several numerical tests are performed to validate
the proposed methodology, including accuracy analysis, Riemann problems and a mul-
tiscale case study of a thoracic aorta with a stent implanted. Finally, some conclusions
are drawn in Section 6.
32 One-dimensional blood flow modeling
The standard 1D mathematical model for blood flow, valid for medium to large-
size vessels, is obtained averaging the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations over the
cross-section, under the assumption of axial symmetry of the vessel and of the flow,
obtaining the well established equations of conservation of mass and momentum [19]:
∂A
∂t+∂(Au)
∂x= 0 (1a)
∂(Au)
∂t+∂(Au2)
∂x+A
ρ∂p
∂x= 0, (1b)
with the choice, in the present work, to neglect friction losses. Here A(x, t) is the cross-
sectional area of the vessel, u(x, t) is the averaged fluid velocity, p(x, t) is the averaged
fluid pressure, ρis the density of the fluid and xandtare respectively space and time.
To close this system of partial differential equations (PDEs), a tube law, represen-
tative of the interaction between vessel wall displacement (through the cross-sectional
areaA) and blood pressure p, is required. To this end, the mechanical behavior of the
vessel wall must be associated with a constitutive model, which relates stress and strain
of the material as much realistically as possible.
2.1 Elastic constitutive law
In the simplest case, the pressure-area relationship is defined considering a perfectly
elastic behavior of the vessel wall, hence the latter behaves like a simple linear spring
characterized by its Young (elastic) modulus E. The constitutive equation of a linear
elastic solid coincides with Hooke’s law, which is expressed as a linear relationship
between stress σ(t) and strain ϵ(t):
σ=Eϵ. (2)
We consider that the deformation of the material is geometrically related to the cross-
sectional area through equation
ε=αm−αn, (3)
where α=A/A 0is the non-dimensional cross-sectional area scaled with respect to
A0(x), equilibrium cross-sectional area, and mandnare specific parameters related to
the behavior of the vessel wall, whether artery or vein [5]. Involving Barlow’s formula,
σ=W(p−p0), (4)
where p0(x) is the equilibrium pressure and W(x) is a parameter depending on the
wall thickness h0(here assumed to be always constant in space) and the equilibrium
inner radius of the wall R0(x), which can have again different definitions if dealing with
4arteries or veins [30], we can re-write Hooke’s law in the following elastic constitutive
tube law, widely adopted in literature [17, 27, 30]:
p=p0+E
W(αm−αn). (5)
Here
ψ=E
W(αm−αn)
is the elastic contribution of the transmural pressure.
If dealing with arteries, this constitutive law corresponds to the so-called Laplace
law. In contrast, when dealing with veins, their possible collapse in case of large negative
transmural pressures needs to be considered [43, 31]. The collapsed state for veins is
identified by a cross-sectional area assuming a buckled, dumbbell shape configuration,
in which opposite sides of the interior wall touch each other, still leaving some fluid
flow in the two extremes. This particular aspect leads to the assumption of different
parameters for the mechanical characterization of the wall behavior. Following [30], we
have:
W=

h0if artery
12R3
0
h3
0if veinm=(
1/2 if artery
10 if veinn=(
0 if artery
−3/2 if vein .(6)
We remark here that, generally, one needs to choose m > 0 and n∈[−2,0] in order to
preserve desirable mathematical properties of the PDE system [43, 35].
2.2 Linear viscoelastic constitutive laws
Even though mathematical models of blood circulation frequently neglect the viscous
component of the vessel wall, it is well known that blood vessels (and living tissues
in general) exhibit viscoelastic properties [46]. Viscoelastic effects are simulated in
literature using different (more or less complex) rheological models, whether linear or
not [1, 23, 9, 44, 22, 20, 24]. With a simple but still effective choice, we can close
system (1) by considering a linear viscoelastic model as representative of the fluid-
structure interaction mechanics of blood with the vessel wall. In general, a constitutive
relation of linear viscoelasticity is built up considering the material as a sum of linear
elastic springs, each one defined by a Young modulus E, and linear viscous dash-pots,
characterized by a viscosity coefficient η, to take into account also the time dependent
relaxation of the wall and its damping effect on pressure waves.
2.2.1 Maxwell constitutive law
The Maxwell (MX) constitutive model consists on a spring and a dash-pot in series
[25], as presented in Fig. 1 (a). In addition to the contribution of the linear elastic
solid, we need to recall that the behavior of a linear dash-pot follows the mechanics of a

tive model

piston moving in an ideal incompressible viscous (Newtonian) fluid. For this dash-pot,
the rheological law reads [21]:
σ=ηdϵ
dt, (7)
which means, the larger the stress, the faster the material deforms. Therefore, the
constitutive law of the MX model results:
dσ
dt=E0dϵ
dt−1
τrσ, (8)
where τris the relaxation time of the material, in this model defined as τr=η/E 0.
The response of the model to a sudden load, maintained constant in time, reflects
an instantaneous deformation of the spring, being the instantaneous Young modulus
E0representative of the elastic response of the material (in our case, the vessel wall),
when the viscous components are “shortened” and do not deform. Subsequently, the
additional strain of the dash-pot, which takes time to react, manifests itself. Once the
load is removed, the spring reacts again immediately, relaxing, but the dash-pot does
not have any tendency to recover. Thus, the system remains with a “creep” strain due
to the dash-pot, even though not very realistic resulting in a straight line in time, in
contrast to curves that are observed experimentally [25]. Otherwise, if a step strain is
applied to the unit, the relaxation response results:
E(t) =E0e−t
τr. (9)
This equation, called relaxation function , describes how the stiffness and the elastic
behavior of the material change in time with respect to the value of the relaxation time
τr, starting from the instantaneous value of the Young modulus E0. Let us notice,
indeed, that t→0 =⇒E(t)→E0. On the other hand, t→ ∞ =⇒E(t)→0, so
with an elastic modulus that vanishes asymptotically in time. This last result implies
that the so-called asymptotic Young modulus (representative of the elastic response
when all effects of the viscosity of the viscoelastic material have manifested themselves)
of the Maxwell rheological model is null, i.e., E∞= 0.
6Taking into account a generic vessel (artery or vein), differentiating with respect to
time eq. (3), it follows that
dε
dt=1
A(mαm−nαn)dA
dt; (10)
while differentiating eq. (4) we obtain
dσ
dt=Wdp
dt. (11)
With these expressions and using the continuity eq. (1a), it is possible to rewrite the
MX constitutive equation (8) into the following PDE:
∂p
∂t+E0
WA(mαm−nαn)∂(Au)
∂x=−1
τr(p−p0). (12)
2.2.2 Kelvin–Voigt constitutive law
If we consider a single spring and a dash-pot connected in parallel, so that they both
experience the same deformation or strain and the total stress is the sum of the stresses
in each element, we have what is known as Kelvin–Voigt (KV) constitutive model [25],
represented in Fig. 1 (b). A KV unit relates strain and stress as follows:
σ=E1ε+ηdε
dt, (13)
It is worth to notice that, due to the mechanics of the model, the asymptotic Young
modulus of the KV unit corresponds to the value E∞=E1.
As previously applied to the MX constitutive law, using eqs. (2)–(4)–(11) and the
continuity eq. (1a), it is possible to obtain the following PDE corresponding to the KV
viscoelastic law:
p=p0+E∞
W(αm−αn)−η
WA(mαm−nαn)∂(Au)
∂x. (14)
This viscoelastic law, which is widely adopted among literature’s well recognized
blood flow models, identifying with the parameter
Γ =ηh0√π
2
the viscous contribution of the material (in the case of arteries) [1, 28, 32], has the
weakness of defining a relaxation response that is a constant plus a Dirac delta function.
When the KV unit is placed at constant strain, indeed, the constitutive eq. (13) reduces
to the simple Hooke’s law, eq. (2). In this way, the stress is taken up by the spring and
is constant too. In fact, we observe that there is no stress relaxation over time and,
therefore, it is not possible to define any relaxation function of the material [25]. On the
7other hand, when the KV unit is suddenly loaded with a constant stress over time, the
spring cannot immediately deform because is held back by the dash-pot. Hence, this
model is not able to describe an instantaneous elastic strain, being the stress initially
totally absorbed by the dash-pot and transferred to the spring only successively in
time. Also when unloading the unit, the dash-pot does not permit to the spring to
instantaneously relax and no permanent strain is left.
2.2.3 Standard Linear Solid constitutive law
A richer behavior can be modeled by considering the Standard Linear Solid (SLS)
constitutive model, represented in Fig. 1 (c) in its version with a Kelvin–Voigt unit in
series with an additional elastic spring [25]. Note that the same considerations that will
follow also apply to the SLS law in its version with a Maxwell unit in parallel with an
additional spring, since there is an exact correspondence between the parameters of the
two versions, as already discussed in [6]. The constitutive equation of the SLS model
readsdσ
dt=E0dε
dt−1
τr(σ−E∞ε), (15)
where we have the instantaneous Young modulus E0, the asymptotic Young modulus
E∞and the relaxation time τr, the last two defined respectively as
E∞=E0E1
E0+E1, τ r=η
E0+E1=(E0−E∞)η
E2
0, (16)
with E0being the Young modulus of the additional spring, in series with the KV unit,
andE1Young modulus of the elastic spring of the KV element itself, as shown in Fig.
1 (c).
This model is the simplest linear viscoelastic model able to realistically exhibit all the
three primary features of a viscoelastic material: creep, stress relaxation and hysteresis
[5, 6]. When the system is suddenly loaded, the instantaneous response is attributed
solely to the first spring. The dash-pot then takes up the stress, transferring the load
to the second spring as it slowly opens over time. If the load is maintained constant
in time, the two springs collaborate as if there were only the two of them in series:
1/E∞= 1/E0+ 1/E1. While reaching this asymptotic state, the creep is attributed
only to the spring in parallel with the dash-pot. Finally, when unloading the system,
the first spring relaxes immediately while the second reacts slowly, being held back by
the dash-pot.
In addition, the SLS law permits to define a relaxation function, describing how
the stiffness of the material changes in time, starting from the instantaneous value and
reaching the asymptotic one:
E(t) =E0e−t
τr+E∞
1−e−t
τr
. (17)
As previously presented for the MX and the KV constitutive laws, it is possible
to write also the SLS constitutive equation in terms of pressure and area through a
8PDE [6]. Introducing eqs. (2)–(4)–(10)–(11) in the rheological law (15) and using the
continuity eq. (1a), the sought PDE is obtained:
∂p
∂t+E0
WA(mαm−nαn)∂(Au)
∂x=−1
τr
p−p0−E∞
W(αm−αn)
. (18)
In the above equation, the coefficient of the transport term
E0G(A), G (A) =1
WA(mαm−nαn) (19)
identifies the elastic contributions of the mechanics of the material, while the source
term
−1
τr(p−F(A)), F (A) =p0+E∞
W(αm−αn) (20)
takes into account the viscous property of the vessel wall.
3 Asymptotic limits
If we consider the SLS constitutive law (18) as closing equation for the governing
system (1), we obtain an augmented fluid-structure interaction (FSI) system of the
cardiovascular bio-fluid dynamics, which reads [5, 8, 35]:
∂A
∂t+∂(Au)
∂x= 0 (21a)
∂(Au)
∂t+∂(Au2)
∂x+A
ρ∂p
∂x= 0 (21b)
∂p
∂t+E0G(A)∂(Au)
∂x=−1
τr(p−F(A)), (21c)
with G(A) and F(A) defined in eqs. (19)-(20), respectively. Thus, from now on, we
will refer to the augmented blood flow model meaning that it is the blood flow model in
which the viscoelastic SLS constitutive law is used to close the problem.
This model is hyperbolic, being the Jacobian matrix diagonalizable, with a diago-
nal matrix Λ containing all real eigenvalues and a complete set of linearly independent
eigenvectors represented by the columns of the matrix R:
Λ =
u−c0 0
0 0 0
0 0 u+c

u−c 0 u+c
E0G(A)ρu2

where cis the wave speed,
c=s

9The second eigenvector of the system is associated with a linearly degenerate (LD) char-
acteristic field, while the first and the third define genuinely non-linear fields (leading to
the formation of shocks or rarefaction waves) [35]. Concerning the Riemann Invariants
of the system, those associated with the LD field are [5, 35]
ΓLD
1=Au, ΓLD

defining the quantities that remain constant across contact discontinuities. The Rie-
mann Invariants associated to the genuinely non-linear fields are, instead,

Γ2=u+Zc
AdA, (24b)
Γ3=p−Z
E0G(A) dA=p−E0
W(αm−αn). (24c)
Notice that when dealing with arteries, also integrals Γ 1and Γ 2can be analytically
solved, resulting
Γ1,2=u∓4c.
Finally, it is here remarked that to accommodate a correct numerical treatment of
possible longitudinal discontinuities in space of geometrical and mechanical properties,
such as equilibrium cross-sectional area, instantaneous Young modulus E0, asymptotic
Young modulus E∞, viscosity coefficient η, and equilibrium pressure p0, it is necessary
to introduce additional equations to system (21) [5, 30]. Considering these variables
constant in time, the additional equations result: ∂tA0= 0, ∂tE0= 0, ∂tE∞= 0,
∂tη= 0 and ∂tp0= 0.
Let us know analyze the asymptotic limits of system (21) as the scaling parameter
τr→0, i.e., the so-called zero-relaxation limits. We will prove that by choosing the
Standard Linear Solid constitutive law as closing equation for the system, with an ap-
propriate choice of the scaling parameters, all the different rheological characterizations
previously discussed can be recovered. Hence, the proposed model can account for sev-
eral mechanical behaviors of the vessel wall, from the elastic to different viscoelastic
ones.
3.1 Hyperbolic scaling
Ifτr→0 while η→0, from the relaxation function (17) we observe that E(t)→
E∞=ˆE, thus the stiffness of the material remains constant in time. This implies that,
in this limit, the vessel wall tends to behave as a purely elastic material characterized
by the Young modulus ˆE=E0E1
E0+E1, which is the resultant of the sum of the Young
moduli of the two springs in series. From eq. (21c) we then recover exactly the elastic
constitutive law (5):
p=F(A) =p0+E∞
W(αm−αn). (25)
10Using this equation into eq. (21b), we observe that the proposed model recovers the
classical blood flow elastic model [17, 30]:
∂A
∂t+∂(Au)
∂x= 0 (26a)
∂(Au)
∂t+∂(Au2)
∂x+A
ρ∂F(A)
∂x= 0. (26b)
Notice that we recover the same equilibrium also for τr→0 while E1→ ∞ , with
the only difference that, in this case, the material tends to behave like a spring with
Young modulus ˆE=E0.
3.2 Diffusive scaling
Ifτr→0 and E0→ ∞ while η=τr(E0+E1)→τrE0remains finite, we observe
that, from eq. (21c) we recover the diffusive behavior of the solution described by the
Kelvin–Voigt constitutive law, hence eq. (14):
p=F(A)−ηG(A)∂(Au)
∂x=p0+E∞
W(αm−αn)−η
WA(mαm−nαn)∂(Au)
∂x,
where E∞=E1.Inserting the above equilibrium into eq. (21b), we obtain the following
parabolic, diffusive model:
∂A
∂t+∂(Au)
∂x= 0 (27a)
∂(Au)
∂t+∂(Au2)
∂x+A
ρ∂F(A)
∂x=A
ρ∂
∂x
η G(A)∂(Au)
∂x
, (27b)
where the presence of the additional parabolic term in the momentum equation is
evident when comparing it to system (26). In fact, this asymptotic limit describes a
strongly diffusive dynamic, in which viscous effects of the vessel wall occur over long
rescaling times.
We highlight that system (27) reads exactly as literature blood flow models that
adopts the Kelvin–Voigt rheological law [1, 17, 28, 32]. It is also worth to emphasize
that, in this limit, the celerity of the system c→ ∞ because of its dependence on the
Young’s modulus E0(see eq. (22) for the definition), which is indeed in agreement with
the parabolic scaling obtained.
3.3 Perturbation of the elastic local equilibrium
Let us now analyze a first order perturbation in τrof the first local equilibrium, i.e.,
the elastic hyperbolic scaling, which has been demonstrated to be the leading order
equation of the SLS model as τr→0 while η→0. The first order perturbation reads
p=p0+E∞
W(αm−αn) +τrp1+O 
τ2
r
. (28)
11Substituting this expansion in eq. (18), we obtain
p1=−∂p
∂t−E0
WA(mαm−nαn)∂(Au)
∂x+O 
τ2
r
.
Since, deriving with respect to time eq. (25),
∂p
∂t=−E∞
WA(mαm−nαn)∂(Au)
∂x,
we finally have
p1=E∞−E0
WA(mαm−nαn)∂(Au)
∂x+O 
τ2
r
.
Substituting back in eq. (28) leads to
p=p0+E∞
W(αm−αn)−τr(E0−E∞)
WA(mαm−nαn)∂(Au)
∂x+O 
τ2
r
.
Considering the last equivalence in eq. (16) and omitting the second order terms in τr,
we can rewrite the above equation as follows, defining a new viscoelastic model that is
a second-order accurate approximation, for τr≪1 and η≪1 (namely, for mild viscous
effects), of the Standard Linear Solid constitutive law:
p=p0+E∞
W(αm−αn)−(E0−E∞)2
E2
0η
WA(mαm−nαn)∂(Au)
∂x. (29)
Inserting the above law into eq. (21b) leads to the following parabolic model:
∂A
∂t+∂(Au)
∂x= 0 (30a)
∂(Au)
∂t+∂(Au2)
∂x+A
ρ∂F(A)
∂x=A
ρ∂
∂x 
(E0−E∞)2
E2
0η G(A)∂(Au)
∂x!
, (30b)
Notice that this new viscoelastic constitutive law differs from the Kelvin–Voigt
one because of the presence of a correction factor ( E0−E∞)2/E2
0in the viscosity
coefficient of the material (which is simply ηin the KV unit). However, unlike the
Kelvin–Voigt constitutive law, this new model describes a dynamic in which the vis-
cous effects of the viscoelastic wall are not predominant, being indeed η≪1 and
0<(E0−E∞)2/E2
0<1. In fact, the newly proposed viscoelastic model permits to
capture the second order small viscosity effects, being a second-order accurate approx-
imation (for small relaxation times τrand viscosity coefficient η) of the model closed
with the SLS constitutive law.
Using eqs. (2)–(4)–(10), the rheological law can be written in terms of stress and
strain, resulting
σ=E∞ε+(E0−E∞)2

rheological law as closing equation for the blood flow model, it is possible to recover,

leading to hyperbolic and diffusive behaviors, respectively. The need for an asymptotic-
preserving (AP) numerical method to computationally simulate these limits is high-
lighted. A specific choice of the asymptotic Young modulus leads to the viscoelastic
MX law. In addition, a new second-order viscoelastic model, for τr≪1, can be derived
through the perturbation of the local elastic equilibrium.
In addition, with the above equation, we observe that the elastic law itself is a
good approximation of the SLS to the first order perturbation in τr, provided that
E0≈E∞=⇒p1≈0. This mathematical result actually confirms what the
mechanics of the SLS already states: if the Young modulus is constant in time, the
material cannot express a relaxation process of the stress and cannot dissipate energy,
so it behaves like a simple elastic spring.
Remark 1 In classical kinetic theory, the space-time scaling just discussed is related
to the hydrodynamical limits of the Boltzmann equation [3, 12, 26]. In particular, the
hyperbolic scaling corresponds to the compressible Euler scaling. In the case of the diffu-
sive scaling, the dissipation effects become non-negligible and we get the incompressible
Navier–Stokes scaling. The second-order accurate viscoelastic model here derived, in-
stead, leads to a model linked to the compressible Navier–Stokes equations.
Remark 2 Regarding the Maxwell viscoelastic characterization, let us point out that
the Standard Linear Solid constitutive law exactly matches the Maxwell one when E1=
E∞= 0. In fact, this implies that F(A) =p0andτr=η/E 0, and from eq. (21c) we
13recover eq. (12). Thus, the complete augmented model reads
∂A
∂t+∂(Au)
∂x= 0 (31a)
∂(Au)
∂t+∂(Au2)
∂x+A
ρ∂p
∂x= 0 (31b)
∂p
∂t+E0G(A)∂(Au)
∂x=−1
τr(p−p0). (31c)
In addition, the relaxation function (17) becomes equivalent to eq. (9).
The summary of all the above limits and derivations is shown in the diagram in Fig.
2 from a constitutive framework perspective.
4 Asymptotic-preserving method
As pointed out in the previous section, the augmented blood flow model (21) turns
out to be a multiscale hyperbolic system, which, accordingly to the choice of the scaling
parameters, can describe also diffusive-type phenomena, i.e., those associated with the
Kelvin–Voigt characterization of the vessel wall material. Thus, selecting an appropriate
numerical method is crucial to ensure the numerical discretization is consistent with
all asymptotic behaviors of the model while maintaining the expected accuracy in the
stiff limit. Moreover, we aim at working with a numerical scheme that does not have
restrictions of the time step size related to the smallness of the scaling parameters.
Indeed, generally, the latter could lead the time step size to be prohibitively small
for stability reasons as τr→0. These features are fulfilled if the chosen numerical
method respects the asymptotic-preserving (AP) property [33, 3, 11]. In the light of
this, to solve the problem we consider a third order AP Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge-
Kutta Finite Volume method, following the partitioned approach proposed in [10] for
hyperbolic systems with multiscale relaxation.
4.1 An IMEX Runge-Kutta Finite Volume scheme
IMEX Runge-Kutta schemes can be easily represented by a double tableau (explicit
on the left, implicit on the right) in the usual Butcher notation [11, 33]
˜c˜A
˜bTcA
bT.
Matrices ˜A= (˜akj), with ˜ akj= 0 for j≥k, and A= (akj) are s×smatrices, with
snumber of Runge-Kutta stages. Being always preferable in terms of computational
efficiency to deal with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) schemes, we consider
akj= 0 for j > k . The temporal steps coefficient vectors are ˜c= (˜c1, ...,˜cs)Tand
14c= (c1, ..., c s)T, while vectors ˜b= (˜b1, ...,˜bs)Tandb= (b1, ..., b s)Tare the quadrature
weights that permit to combine the internal Runge-Kutta stages.
In particular, we employ the third-order globally stiffly accurate (GSA) IMEX
BPR(3,4,3) scheme proposed in [11], which is characterized by 4 stages for the im-
plicit part and 3 stages for the explicit part (see Appendix A). In the following, we give
recall the definition of the GSA property.
Definition 1 An IMEX Runge-Kutta method is said to be globally stiffly accurate
(GSA) if the corresponding diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) method is stiffly
accurate, namely
asj=bj, j = 1, . . . , s,
and the explicit method satisfies
˜asj=˜bj, j = 1, . . . , s −1.
As a consequence of the above definition the numerical solution of a GSA IMEX method
coincides exactly with the last internal stage of the scheme.
Notice that the third order IMEX Runge-Kutta method (57) is of type CK (see
[10, 14]), since the matrix Acan be written as
A=00
aˆA
, (32)
witha= (a21, ..., a s1)T∈R(s−1)and the sub-matrix ˆA ∈R(s−1)×(s−1)is invertible,
hence akk̸= 0, k= 2, . . . , s . We will also make use of the following representation of
the matrix ˜Ain the explicit Runge-Kutta method:
˜A= 
00
˜aˆ˜A!
, (33)
where ˜a= (˜a21, ...,˜as1)T∈R(s−1)andˆ˜A ∈R(s−1)×(s−1).
To obtain an AP scheme, the IMEX Runge-Kutta temporal discretization of system
(21), written in semi-discrete form, consists in computing the internal stages
A(k)=An−∆tk−1X
j=1˜akj∂x(Au)(j)(34a)
(Au)(k)= (Au)n−∆tk−1X
j=1˜akj∂x

,(34c)
15fork= 1, . . . , s , and then the final numerical solution (even though, for definition,
the numerical solution of a GSA IMEX Runge-Kutta scheme coincides exactly with the
last internal stage of the scheme), which reads
An+1=An−∆tsX
k=1˜bk∂x(Au)(k)(35a)

p(k)−F(A(k))
. (35c)
The time step size ∆ t=tn+1−tnfollows the less restrictive between the standard
hyperbolic Courant-Friedrichs-Levy condition, ∆ t≤CFL∆x/max{|u±c|}, and the
parabolic stability restriction, ∆ t≤ν∆x2, where ∆ x=xi+1/2−xi−1/2,i= 1, . . . , N x,
with Nxnumber of cells, is the size of the uniform space grid and CFLandνare suitable
stability constants [11].
For the space derivatives, we consider a Finite Volume discretization. To ensure the
correct treatment of both conservative and non-conservative terms of system (21) even
in case of variables that are discontinuous in space, to evaluate numerical fluxes and non-
conservative jump terms we employ the Dumbser-Osher-Toro (DOT) Riemann solver
[16, 15, 5, 6]. Boundary-extrapolated values at both interfaces of cell iare computed
through a third order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction
[42, 37].

where ˆe= (1, . . . , 1)T∈R(s−1). To solve the problem, from eq. (38b) we can directly
compute explicitly ˆA, thus, also F(ˆA) and G(ˆA), while from eq. (38d) we obtain
explicitly ˆAu. Then, inverting eq. (38f), we obtain an explicit expression to compute

,
17and definitely solve system (39).
Before analyzing in details the asymptotic behavior of the method, we need to
introduce the notion of well prepared initial data, or, equivalently, initial data consistent
with the limit problem [10].
Definition 2 The initial data for system (21)is said to be consistent orwell prepared
if
p(x,0) = F(A(x,0))−τrE0G(A(x,0))∂x(A(x,0)u(x,0)) +O(τr). (41)
Let us now show the AP property of the IMEX method in the two asymptotic limits.
Proof 1 (Proof of the AP property for the hyperbolic scaling) Asτr→0while
η→0, when considering consistent initial data as in (41), hence at the initial iteration
pn=F(An), from eq. (40a) , recalling also eq. (38a) and(38e) , we obtain

p(1)−F(A(1))
+ˆA−1ˆAF(ˆA)
=−ˆA−1a(pn−F(An)) +F(ˆA)
=F(ˆA).
Moreover, since the scheme is GSA, we also have that pn+1=F(An+1), so at the next
time step the initial value remains consistent. If we now insert this result in eq. (38d) ,
we exactly recover a consistent explicit Runge-Kutta discretization of the elastic system
(26), having internal stages

Proof 2 (Proof of the AP property for the diffusive scaling) Ifτr→0while
E0→ ∞ andη=τrE0remains finite, when considering consistent initial data as in
(41), from eq. (40a) and recalling again also eq. (38a) and(38e) , we can compute

=−ηG(ˆA)∂x(ˆAu) +F(ˆA).
18Also in this case, being the scheme GSA, pn+1=F(An+1)−η G(An+1)∂x(Au)n+1, which
permits to maintain consistent initial data also for the further time steps. Substituting
the above result in eq. (38d) , we correctly recover a consistent explicit discretization for
the parabolic system (27), having internal stages

(47b)
The above analyses show that the proposed IMEX Runge-Kutta scheme provides a
high order temporal discretization that is consistent with the behavior of the continuous
model even in the asymptotic regimes, meaning that the scheme is satisfying not only
the AP property but also the property of being asymptotically accurate [33].
Remark 3
•We emphasize that one could choose a different IMEX partitioning of the problem,
following the methodology proposed in [11]. This method treats partly explicitly and
partly implicitly the terms in the second and third equation of system (21), reading
in compact form as
A=Ane−∆t˜A∂x(Au) (48a)
Au= (Au)ne−∆t˜A∂x 

−∆tAA
ρ∂xp (48b)
p=pne−∆t˜AE0G(A)∂x(Au)−∆tA
τr(p−F(A)). (48c)
We have tested also the above approach by obtaining analogous results to those here
presented. Note, however, that the above method requires the additional condition
˜c=cin order to preserve the stationary solutions of the problem. We refer to
[10, 11] for more details.
•It is here stressed that the construction of numerical methods that preserve the
order of accuracy also in regimes described by model (30), arising from the per-
turbation of the local elastic equilibrium, requires additional conditions, which are
not addressed in the context of this paper. The reader may refer to [10] for further
discussion of these issues.
194.3 Well-balanced property
For consistent initial data, we can show that the partitioned IMEX scheme (34)-(35)
results well-balanced in time , meaning that, by ignoring the space discretization error,
it preserves stationary solutions [5, 30, 36]. More precisely, we have
∂x(Au)n= 0 (49a)
ρ ∂x(Au2)n+An∂xpn= 0 = ⇒Qn+1=Qn(49b)
pn−F(An) +τrE0G(An)∂x(Au)n= 0, (49c)
where Q= (A, Au, p )T. Note that the last equation is equivalent to assume that the
initial condition is well prepared, as in Definition 2.
Proof 3 (Proof of the well-balanced property) Let us consider an initial condi-
tion as in (49) for the model (21). From the scheme (37), we have Qn+1=Qnif
∆t˜bT∂x(Au) = 0

= 0.
This is guaranteed if A=Ane,Au= (Au)ne,p=pne. We can verify that the just
mentioned solution is indeed the unique one for system (38). In fact, knowing already
that the first step of the method reads A(1)=An,Au(1)= (Au)n,p(1)=pn, we only
need to satisfy additionally
˜a∂x(Au)(1)+ˆ˜A∂x(ˆAu) = 0
˜a

+ˆA 
ˆp−F(ˆA)
τr+E0G(ˆA)∂x(ˆAu)!
= 0.
To this end, we observe that, under the assumptions (49), it is always verified that
∂x(Au)(1)= 0
ρ ∂x(Au2)(1)+A(1)∂xp(1)= 0
p(1)−F(A(1)) +τrE0G(A(1))∂x(Au)(1)= 0
∂x(ˆAu) = 0
ρ ∂x(ˆAu2) +ˆA∂xˆp= 0
ˆp−F(ˆA) +τrE0G(ˆA)∂x(ˆAu) = 0 ,
which concludes the proof.
204.4 Boundary conditions
In order to simulate realistic scenarios, inflow and outflow boundary conditions are
imposed by prescribing an input flow rate waveform in time and coupling the output of
the 1D model to a 0D RCR model (a lumped-parameter model, also known as 3-element
Windkessel model) [39, 38]. For simplicity, the treatment is presented for a first order
of accuracy. For extensions to higher orders, the reader can refer to [35, 29].
To evaluate the fluxes at the inlet of the domain, knowing at each Runge-Kutta
time steps the inlet flow rate qin, we recur to the Riemann Invariants Γ 1and Γ 3in eq.
(24) and solve the system

eq. (22) and involves the variables AandE0. Under the assumptions A0,in=A0,1,
E0,in=E0,1andE∞,in=E∞,1, the system can be numerically solved recurring to a
Newton-Raphson iterative procedure to find Ainand then straightforwardly compute
uinandpinwith Γ 1and Γ 3, respectively.
At the outlet of the domain, an RCR circuit (analogous to the corresponding electri-
cal circuit), consisting of a resistor with resistance R1connected in series with a parallel
combination of a second resistor with resistance R2and a capacitor with compliance
C, is used to simulate the effects of resistance and compliance of the terminal arteries
on the propagation of pressure waves (see Fig. 8 for a sketch). The RCR ordinary
differential equation (ODE) model reads [35]:

and pressure, respectively, at the interface between 1D and 0D model, and poutis the
pressure at the outlet of the RCR unit, fixed to be pout= 0 to mimic the blood pressure
when the flux reaches the venous system. We discretize in time the ODE explicitly
due to the absence of stiff terms, and couple the problem with the Riemann Invariants

5 Numerical tests and applications
In this section, we present several numerical tests that permit to validate the pro-
posed methodology. First, an accuracy analysis of the method is performed considering
three different configurations of the scaling parameters of the augmented blood flow
model, accounting for the different asymptotic behaviors discussed in Section 3. Then,
five Riemann problems (RP) are executed, to test the methodology in presence of vari-
ables discontinuous in space, again taking into account different constitutive settings.
The first of these problems aims to verify also numerically the well-balancing of the
method. Finally, a more applied test case is performed taking into account a multiscale
configuration of the rheological parameters. In this test, the haemodynamics of a tho-
racic aorta is simulated under normal, healthy conditions, and compared with that in
the presence of a stent/prosthesis in the center of the vessel. The latter constitutes an
element of increased, localized, wall stiffening that it is considered to lead the model to
the parabolic scaling in the stretch where the stent is situated. In all the simulations,
for stability we fix CFL = 0.9 and ν= 0.5. Finally, if not otherwise stated, in the
WENO reconstruction to compute the nonlinear weights we fix the positive parameter
ε= 10−6[42].
5.1 Accuracy analysis

ber that, due to the presence of variables in the system (21) that have widely varying

to avoid numerical errors, especially when using high-order methods. [36]. For details
on the derivation of the dimensionless form the reader can refer to the Appendix A.

Then, we fix Au(x,0) = 5 ·10−5m3/s,A(x,0) = A0(x,0) and evaluate p(x,0) through
the elastic tube law, eq. (5), knowing the initial condition of the rest of the variables.
We consider a hypothetical artery of length L= 1 m and wall thickness h0= 1.5 mm,
with ¯A= 5 cm2, ¯a= 1 cm2,¯P0= 5 kPa, ¯ p= 500 Pa, ¯ e= 0.2 MPa and ¯E∞= 0.8
MPa, and blood density ρ= 1050 kg/m3. The value of ¯E0, together with that of
τrand, consequently, η, are set accordingly to three different combinations, in order
to perform an accuracy analysis of the method in all the configurations given by the

In Table 1, we can notice that the expected order of accuracy is plainly confirmed,
even if especially the KV and EL configurations define very stiff problems. In Fig. 3, a
comparison of the final results obtained in the three constitutive settings is presented
for the main variables of the system, where the different response of the viscoelastic
configurations can be appreciated.
5.2 Riemann problems
Five Riemann problems, for which an exact solution is available when considering
a simple elastic behavior of the vessel wall [43], have been selected with reference to
[5, 30, 36] to test the methodology in presence of variables’ discontinuities. The first RP
aims to numerically verify the well-balancing of the scheme in a blood at rest condition
for a generic arterial setting. The rest of the problems, in addition to being simulated
in the case of elastic wall (case (a)), have also been simulated considering two different
viscoelastic characterizations (case (b) and (c)) to highlight the impact of the viscous
damping of the vessel. The complete set of data and initial conditions is listed, for
each RP and each constitutive framework, in Tables 2 and 3. Each test has been run
with Nx= 100 cells in the computational domain and setting ε= 10−14in the WENO
reconstruction.
RP1 In this test, we consider a generic arterial setting and verify the well-balancing of
the scheme, namely we confirm also numerically that the method preserves stationary

solutions. To do so, we simulate the particular case of blood at rest (i.e., the stationary
case at zero flow rate), as taken from [30, 36]. The relative L2norms computed for the
three main state variables A,Auandpat time tend= 0.1 (after 1040 time iterations)

balance of the method.
RP2 The second Riemann problem (RP2) schematically represents the arrival of a
systolic pulse pressure and, consequently, a spike in blood flow in a portion of the
thoracic aorta. In this problem, the left side of the aorta, thus the part that in the
initial state is reached by the systolic peak, is compressed, while to the right of the
initial discontinuity the aorta is 10 times stiffer than the part to the left. This idealized
configuration leads to partial reflection of the incoming wave, which can be seen in Fig.
4 by the presence of the shock wave on the left. The solution, indeed, consists of a left
shock and a right shock traveling in opposite directions and separated by a stationary
contact discontinuity. The elastic numerical solution results in very good agreement
with the exact one. At the same time, the viscous damping effects are well visible when
comparing solutions (b) and (c) with the elastic one (a), especially in the right tract of
the vessel, characterized by a higher wall viscosity. In particular, an evident forward
shift of the shock position is here observed.
RP3 In the third Riemann problem (RP3), the effects of a Valsalva maneuver on a
portion of the internal jugular vein are schematically depicted. The Valsalva maneuver
consists of forced exhalation with a closed glottis, an operation that produces a large

increase in the subject’s central venous pressure. In addition, in this test, an incompe-
tent valve is considered downstream at the heart, causing venous reflux to the head. As
presented in Fig. 5, the solution consists of a left shock and a right rarefaction traveling
in opposite directions and separated by a stationary contact discontinuity. Also in this
very challenging test case, a good agreement of the elastic numerical result is observed
with respect to the exact solution. The solution of configuration (b) differs only slightly
from that of the elastic configuration (a), while solution (c) shows the effects of wall
viscosity better, especially with regard to the velocity trend.
RP4 In the fourth Riemann Problem (RP4) considered, we simulate the dynamics of
a tract of thoracic aorta that initially presents all the model’s variables continuous in
space, except for the cross-sectional area and, consequently, the pressure. The solution
of the problem, presented in Fig. 6, shows the propagation of a left rarefaction and a
right shock wave, very well captured by the model in the elastic case when comparing
numerical results with the exact solution. Finally, the different effects of the chosen

relaxation time τr, which correspond to 3 different configurations of the problem (one

tion of the elastic case ( τr= 0).
viscosity configurations can also be appreciated.
RP5 In the last Riemann problem (RP5), we consider a generic vein whose wall in
the second half is 30 times stiffer than the first half and thus subject to greater internal
pressure. Moreover, an initial condition of reflux in the first half of the vessel only is
considered. The solution of this problem consists of left and right rarefactions traveling
in opposite directions and separated by a stationary contact discontinuity, as depicted
in Fig. 7. Once more, the elastic numerical result is in line with the reference solution.
Configuration (b) shows only a small damping effect, especially in the right rarefaction
wave, while configuration (c) results in a substantial forward shift of the position of
the right rarefaction and a raising of the central plateau of flow rate, velocity and area
ratio solutions.

relaxation time τr, which correspond to 3 different configurations of the problem (one

5.3 Multiscale case study: Thoracic aorta with a stent
As a result of some vascular diseases, a section of an artery might be replaced by a
prosthesis or reinforced by the application of a stent (a metal net), causing a sudden
change in the mechanical properties of the vessel [40].
Inspired by [41, 18], we have designed a test case relating to a section of thoracic
aorta in which a stent has been inserted in the middle of it, causing a stiffening of
the wall in the center of the vessel. This represents an effective multiscale case study,
in which different values of the scaling parameters of the model are attributed to the
vessel wall, which lead the system to tend towards the asymptotic diffusive limit (see
Section 3) in the tract affected by the stent. Indeed, we consider that in the portion of
the vessel where the stent is present the Young moduli of the wall are increased by a
factor of 100 and the relaxation time of the material is reduced by the same factor. In
Table 4, all the parameters and initial conditions of the test are given, while in Fig. 8
a schematic representation of the test layout is shown. The parameters of the stentless

part of the vessel are set referring to [47, 8]. Referring to these same works, a realistic
input flow rate waveform is considered and RCR model parameters are fixed at the
output of the 1D domain, allowing a plausible simulation of the effects of peripheral
resistance and compliance on the pulse wave propagation.
The simulation has been run with Nx= 24 computational cells for 10 cardiac cycles
(duration 0 .955 s = 63 bpm each), both in presence of the stent and under normal,
healthy conditions, to allow comparisons. In Figure 9, the space-time solution in the
stented configuration is shown for one cardiac cycle for the main variables. In the
same figure the control sections are also indicated, corresponding to those depicted in
the layout in Figure 8. In Figure 10, the time evolutions in one cardiac cycle of the
main variables and hysteresis curves are presented for both the normal and stented
configurations with respect to the 3 control sections. As expected, the presence of
the stent significantly alters the blood flow propagation, creating, in particular, wave
reflections due to the impact with the stiffer region, which cause an increase in pressure
peaks [18], especially visible in the upstream pressure plot. It can be observed that

also the velocity undergoes an increase in the systolic phase, mostly in the stented
tract. On the other hand, because of the greater stiffness of the stent, changes in cross-
sectional area from equilibrium cannot be appreciated in the central region with respect
to those produced by the original vessel wall (see αand hysteresis midpoint plots). In
this regard, Figure 11 compares the longitudinal section of the vessel without and with
the stent at three different temporal instants: at the beginning of the cardiac cycle,
at the time of the systolic peak, and during the diastolic phase (after the dichrotic
notch), highlighting the almost zero stretchability of the stent compared with that of
the regions without the stent [41].

6 Conclusions
In the present study, we introduce a multiscale constitutive framework for the pur-
pose of modeling one-dimensional blood flow. We show that the proposed augmented
model, which takes into account a linear viscoelastic constitutive characterization of
the fluid-structure interaction occurring between the vessel wall and the blood flow,
can describe different physical propagation phenomena ranging from hyperbolic trans-
port to parabolic diffusion, recovering alternative rheological behaviors of blood vessels.
This highly flexible, yet accurate, mathematical model is ideally suited for modeling
the complex cardiovascular system, which is characterized by significant morphological
and mechanical variability. We further derive a novel viscoelastic constitutive model
by analyzing the perturbation of the local elastic equilibrium of the system allowing us
to capture the second order small viscosity effects.
To solve the resulting multiscale hyperbolic system, we employ a state-of-the-art
third-order asymptotic-preserving IMEX Runge-Kutta finite volume method that en-
sures consistency of the numerical scheme with the asymptotic limits of the mathe-

matical model. Notably, our method enables us to choose a time step size that is not
affected by restrictions related to the smallness of the scaling parameters and fulfills
the well-balance property in time. Several numerical tests confirm the validity of the
approach, including a case study related to the hemodynamics of a thoracic aorta in
the presence of a stent.
Further research will be directed toward a more in-depth treatment of the augmented
blood flow model coupled with the new viscoelastic constitutive law derived from lo-
cal elastic equilibrium perturbation. Additionally, we will explore the extension of our
methodology to the main cardiovascular network [35], as well as investigate the sensi-
tivity of the model with respect to mechanical scaling parameters through uncertainty
quantification approaches [4, 7].
A Numerical implementation aspects
A.1 Dimensionless form of the model
Due to the presence of variables in system (21) that have very different orders of
magnitude, a switch to the dimensionless form of the equations is necessary to avoid
numerical fluctuations, especially when using high-order methods [36]. Fixing the char-
acteristic values for length ( ¯L), time ( ¯T), blood density (¯ ρ), cross-sectional vessel area
(¯A), viscosity (¯ η), Young modulus ( ¯E= ¯η/¯T), and velocity ¯U=¯L/¯T, the following
dimensionless variables are introduced:
x∗=x
¯L, t∗=t
¯T, ρ∗=ρ
¯ρ, A∗=A
¯A, u∗=u
¯U, p∗=p
¯ρ¯U2,

¯A, E∗
0=E0
¯E, E∗
∞=E∞
¯E, p∗
0=p0
¯ρ¯U2, τ∗
r=τr
¯T.
34Thus, system (21) can be written as:
∂A∗
∂t∗+∂(A∗u∗)
∂x∗= 0 (56a)
∂(A∗u∗)
∂t∗+∂((A∗u∗)2/A∗)

∂x∗=−1

.(56c)
It is worth to notice that here ˜Re= ¯ρ¯U¯L/¯ηis the Reynolds number accounting for the
viscosity ¯ ηof the wall and not the viscosity of the fluid (in contrast with the classical
definition). Finally, in the above system we consider ¯L=Lm (length of the domain),

A.2 Third order IMEX method
Following the third-order GSA BPR(3,4,3) scheme proposed in [11], which is char-
acterized by s= 4 stages for the implicit part and 3 stages for the explicit part, the
Butcher tableaux we employ (explicit on the left and implicit on the right) are:
