1 Introduction and main results
1.1 Motivation
Random walks conditioned to staying positive is a popular to pic in probability. In addition to
their own interest, such as information about the maxima and the minima, the ladder variables
andtheladderepoch ofrandomwalks on R, they arealsoimportant in view oftheir applications,
for instance in queuing theory, in coding the genealogy of Ga lton-Watson trees or else as models
for polymers and interfaces; we refer to [4] and references t herein.
The ﬁrst interesting question is to determine the asymptoti c behavior of the exit time from
the half line [0 ,+∞[, and then to prove limit theorems for the process restricte d to this half
line or conditioned to remain there. More precisely, let ( Sn)n≥1be a random walk in Rwhose
increments are independent with common distribution. Assu me that (Sn)n≥1is centered and
letτbe its exit time from [0 ,+∞[. Then, for any a,b,ℓ>0, asn→+∞,
Pa(τ >n,a+Sn∈[b,b+ℓ[)∼ch+(a)h−(b)
n3/2ℓ, (1.1)
wherecis a positive constant and h+andh−are the renewal functions associated to ( Sn)n≥1,
based on ascending and descending ladder heights (in partic ular these functions are positive).

1Important conceptual diﬃculties arise both when the random walk (Sn)n≥1isRd-valued
withd≥2 (the half line being replace by a general cone of the Euclide an space), or when the
increments of the random walk are no longer independent. As f ar as we know, equivalent theory
based on factorizations for these processes does not exist. In dimension d≥2, the Wiener-Hopf
factorization method works when the cone is a half space but b reaks down for more general
cones. Any attempt to develop a theory of ﬂuctuations for hig her-dimensional random walks
deals with the question: what would play the role of ladder ep ochs and ladder variables? [13];
Kingman showed in particular the impossibility of extendin g Baxter and Spitzer approach to
random walks in higher dimension [16].
In 2055, D. Denisov and V. Wachtel developed a new approach to study the exit time from
a cone of a random walk and several consequent limit theorems [5]. Their strategy, based on the
approximation of these walks suitably normalized by a Brown ian motion, with a strict control of
the speed of convergence, is promising, powerful and ﬂexibl e. It allows in particular to approach
the random walks whose jumps are not i.i.d.
This ﬂexible approach could be adapted to the quantity Sn(x) := ln|gn···g1(x)|, where
(gk)k≥1is a sequence of i.i.d. random matrices, xis a non nul vector in Rdand| · |is theL1
norm in Rd; this process falls within the general framework of Markov w alks onRsatisfying
some spectral gap assumption. The behavior of the tail of the distribution of τx,a:= inf{n≥
1 :a+ln|gn···g1(x)| ≤0}is known for a few years when the random matrices are invertib le or
non-negative [12] [21]. This is extended by I. Grama, R. Lauv ergnat & E. Le Page in [10] to the
case of Markov walks, under a spectral gap assumption. Never theless, the question of a local
limit theorem for ln |gn···g1(x)|conﬁned in a half line still resists. In [11] such a statement
holds for conditioned Markov walks over a ﬁnite state space, in which case the dual driving
Markov chain also satisﬁes nice spectral gap properties; un fortunately, such a property does not
hold for product of random matrices since it is not realistic to assume that the random matrices
Mnact projectively on a ﬁnite set.
1.2 Notations and assumptions
We endow Rdwith theL1norm|·|deﬁnedby |x|:=d/summationdisplay
i=1|xi|for any column vector x= (xi)1≤i≤d.
LetSbe the set of d×dmatrices with positive entries. We endow Swith the standard
multiplication of matrices, then the set Sis a semigroup. For any g= (g(i,j))1≤i,j≤d∈ S, we
deﬁnev, endow|·|a norm on Sand deﬁneNas follows,
v(g) := min
1≤j≤d/parenleftBigd/summationdisplay
i=1g(i,j)/parenrightBig
;|g|:=d/summationdisplay
i,j=1g(i,j) andN(g) := max/parenleftbigg1
v(g),|g|/parenrightbigg
.
Notice that N(g)≥1 for anyg∈ S.
LetCbe the cone of column vectors deﬁned by C:={x∈Rd| ∀1≤i≤d,xi≥0}andXbe
the limited standard simplex deﬁned by X:={x∈ C | |x|= 1}. For anyx∈ C, we denote by ˜ x
the corresponding row vector and set ˜C={˜x|x∈ C}and˜X={˜x|x∈X}.
We consider the following actions:
•the linear action of SonC(resp.˜C) deﬁned by ( g,x)/ma√sto→gx(resp. (g,˜x)/ma√sto→˜xg) for any
g∈ Sandx∈ C,
2•the projective action of SonX(resp.˜X) deﬁned by ( g,x)/ma√sto→g·x:=gx
|gx|(resp. (g,˜x)/ma√sto→
˜x·g=˜xg
|˜xg|) for anyg∈ Sandx∈X.
It is noticeable that 0 <v(g)|x| ≤ |gx| ≤ |g| |x|for anyx∈ C.
For any ﬁxed x∈Xanda≥0, we denote by τx,athe ﬁrst time the random process
(a+ln|gn···g1x|)nbecomes negative, i.e.
τx,a:= min{n≥1 :a+ln|gn···g1x| ≤0}.
We impose the following assumptions on µ.
P1Moment assumption : There exists δ1>0such that/integraldisplay
S|lnN(g)|2+δ1µ(dg)<+∞.
Notice that hypothesis P1is weaker than the one in [21] where exponential moments are
required; the argument developed in [21] is improved by allo wing various parameters (see [20],
Proof of Theorem 1.6 (d) ).
P2Irreducibility assumption: There exists no aﬃne subspaces AofRdsuch thatA∩ Cis
non-empty and bounded and invariant under the action of all e lements of the support of µ.
This assumption is classical in the context of product of pos itive random matrices, it ensures
in particular that the central limit theorem satisﬁed by the se products is meaningful since the
variance is positive (see Corollary 3 in [14]).
P3There exists B >0such that for µ-almost all ginSand any 1≤i,j,k,l≤d
g(i,j)
B≤g(k,l)≤B g(i,j).
This is a classical assumption for product of random matrice s with positive entries, it was
ﬁrst introduced by H. Furstenberg and H. Kesten [8].
P4Centering The upper Lyapunov exponent γµis equal to 0.
P5There exists δ5>0such thatµ{g∈ S:∀x∈X,ln|gx| ≥δ5}>0.
Condition P5ensures that uniformly in x∈ C \ {0}, the probability that the process ( a+
ln|gn···g1x|)n≥1remains in the half line [0 ,+∞[ is positive. It is satisﬁed for instance when
µ{g|v(g)>1}>0.
Asitisusualinstudyinglocalprobabilities, onehastodis tinguishbetween“lattice” and“non
lattice” cases. The “non lattice” assumption ensures that t heR-component of the trajectories
of the Markov walk ( Xn,Sn)n≥0do not live in the translation of a proper subgroup of R; in the
contrary case, when µis lattice, a phenomenon of cyclic classes appears which inv olves some
complications which are not interesting in our context. We r efer to equality (2.1) in section 2
for a precise deﬁnition in the context of products of random m atrices.
P6Non-lattice assumption The measure µis non-lattice.
The tail of the distribution of τx,ahas been the subject of an extensive study in [21]: under
hypotheses P1-P5, there exists a positive Borel function V:X×R+→R+such that as
3n→+∞,
P(τx,a>n)∼2
σ√
2πnV(x,a).
In the sequel, we also need to consider the process ( b−ln|˜xg1···gn|)n,˜x∈˜X,b∈R+, associated
to the right products g1...gn,n≥1. We thus also consider the stopping time
˜τ˜x,b:= min{n≥1 :b−ln|˜xg1···gn| ≤0}.
As above, there exists a positive Borel function ˜V:X×R+→R+such that as n→+∞,
P(˜τ˜x,b>n)∼2
σ√
2πn˜V(˜x,b).
At last, asn→+∞, the sequence/parenleftbigga+ln|gn···g1x|
σ√n/parenrightbigg
nconditioned to the event ( τx,a>n)
converges weakly towards the Rayleigh distribution on R+whose density equals y e−y2/21R+(y).
Properties of the function Vare precisely stated in section 2.
The natural question is to get a local limit theorem for the pr ocess (a+ ln|gn···g1x|)n≥1
forced to stay positive up to time n, in other words to describe the behavior of the quantity
P(τx,a>n,a+ln|gn···g1x| ∈[b,b+ℓ]) asn→+∞, whena,b>0 andℓ>0.
1.3 Main statements
We ﬁrst state a version of the Gnedenko local limit theorem.
Theorem 1.1 Assume hypotheses P1-P6. Then, as n→+∞, for anyx∈X,a∈R, any
b≥0andℓ>0,
lim
n→+∞/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglenP(τx,a>n,a+ln|gn···g1x| ∈[b,b+ℓ])−2√
2π
σ2√nV(x,a)b e−b2/2nℓ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle= 0,
the convergence being uniform in x∈Xandb≥0.
Notice that Theorem 1.1 says only that this probability is o(n−1). The following theorem
describes an asymptotic behavior of P(τx,a>n,a+ln|gn···g1x| ∈[b,b+ℓ]).Recall that ∆ = ln δ
whereδis deﬁned in Lemma 2.2.
Theorem 1.2 Assume hypotheses P1-P6. There exists positive constant c,C >0such that,
for anyx∈X,a,b≥0andℓ>0,
n3/2P(τx,a>n,a+ln|gn···g1x| ∈[b,b+ℓ])≤C V(x,a)˜V(x,b)ℓ. (1.2)
Furthermore, there exists ℓ0,∆>0such that, for ℓ>ℓ0andb≥∆,
liminf
n→+∞n3/2P(τx,a>n,a+ln|gn···g1x| ∈[b,b+ℓ])≥c V(x,a)˜V(x,b)ℓ.(1.3)
4As for random walks with i.i.d. increments, it is expected th at this probability is in fact
equivalent to n3/2up to a positive constant. The argument relies on a combinati on of what is
sometimes called “reverse time” and “duality” in the classi cal theory of random walks; roughly
speaking, it relies on thefactthat, for aclassical randomw alk (Sn)n≥1with i.i.d. increments, the
vectors (S1,S2,...,S n) and (Sn−Sn−1,Sn−Sn−2,...,S n) have the same distribution. In [10],
this ideahasbeendeveloped in thecontext of Markov walks ov er aMarkov chain withﬁnitestate
space, it is technically much more diﬃcult and so far, it esca pes from the framework of random
matrix products (see the paragraph before Lemma 2.3 for more detailed explanations). In the
case of non-negative random matrices, the diﬀerence between ln|gn...g1x|and ln|gn...g1|is
uniformlybounded(see Lemma2.2 below), onecan thusavoid t heprecisestudyoftheassociated
dual chain4to obtain the above result, a bit less precise but still worth of interest.
Notation. Let cbe a strictly positive constant and φ,ψbe two functions of some variable x;
we denote by φc
/√re⌋edesequalψ(or simply φ/√re⌋edesequalψ) whenφ(x)≤c ψ(x)for any value of x. The notation
φc≍ψ(or simplyφ≍ψ) meansφc
/√re⌋edesequalψc
/√re⌋edesequalφ.
2 Preliminaries
2.1 The killed Markov walk on X×Rand its harmonic function
We consider a sequence of i.i.d. S-valued matrices ( gn)n≥0with common distribution µand
denote the left and right product of matrices Ln,k:=gn...gkandRk,n=gk···gnfor any
n≥k≥0.
We ﬁx a X-valued random variable X0and consider the Markov chain ( Xn)n≥0deﬁned by
XX0n:=Ln,1·X0for anyn≥1; whenX0=x, we set for simplicity Xn=Xx
n. Similarly, the
˜X-valued Markov chain ( ˜Xn)n≥0is deﬁned by ˜Xn:=˜X0·R1,nfor anyn≥1, where ˜X0is a ﬁxed
˜X-valued random variable.
Notice that the sequence ( gn+1,Xx
n)n≥0(resp. (gn+1,˜X˜x
n)n≥0) is aS×Xvalued (resp. S×˜X
valued) Markov chain with initial distribution µ⊗δx(resp.µ⊗δ˜x). Their respective transition
probability PandQare deﬁned by: for any ( g,x)∈ S ×Xand any bounded Borel function
ϕ:S ×X→C,φ:S ×˜X→C,
Pϕ(g,x) :=/integraldisplay
Sϕ(h,g·x)µ(dh) andQφ(g,˜x) :=/integraldisplay
Sϕ(h,˜x·g)µ(dh).
We denote by (Ω = ( S ×X)⊗N,F=B(S ×X)⊗N,(gn+1,Xx
n)n≥0,θ,Px) the canonical probability
space associated with ( gn+1,Xx
n)n≥0, whereθis the classical “shift operator” on ( S ×X)⊗N.
Similarly ( ˜Ω,˜F,(gn+1,˜X˜x
n)n≥0,˜θ,P˜x) denotes the canonical probability space associated with
(gn+1,˜X˜x
n)n≥0.
We introduce next the functions ρant ˜ρdeﬁned for any g∈ Sandx∈Xby
ρ(g,x) := ln|gx|and ˜ρ(g,˜x) := ln|˜xg|.
Notice that gx=eρ(g,x)g·xand thatρsatisﬁes the “cocycle property”:
ρ(gh,x) =ρ(g,h·x)+ρ(h,x),∀g,h∈ Sandx∈X.
4This study would require restrictive conditions on µ, for example the existence of a density.
5This yields to the following basic decomposition
ln|Ln,1x|=n−1/summationdisplay
k=0ρ(gk+1,Xx
k) and ln |˜xR1,n|=n−1/summationdisplay
k=0ρ(gk+1,˜X˜x
k).
This is thus natural to introduce the following Markov walks onX×Rand˜X×Rdeﬁned by
Sn=S0+n−1/summationdisplay
k=0ρ(gk+1,Xx
k)and˜Sn=˜S0−n−1/summationdisplay
k=0˜ρ(gk+1,X˜x
k)whereS0and˜S0arereal valuedrandom
variables. Notice that the sequences ( Xn,Sn)n≥0and (˜Xn,˜Sn)n≥0are Markov chains on X×R
and˜X×Rrespectively, with transition probability /tildewidePand/tildewideQdeﬁned by: for any ( x,a)∈X×R
and any bounded Borel functions Φ : X×R→C,Ψ :˜X×R→C,
/tildewidePΦ(x,a) =/integraldisplay
SΦ(g·x,a+ρ(g,x))µ(dg) and /tildewideQΨ(˜x,a) =/integraldisplay
SΨ(˜x·g,a−˜ρ(g,˜x))µ(dg).
For any (x,a)∈X×R, we denote by Px,athe probability measure on (Ω ,F) conditioned to
the event ( X0=x,S0=a) and by Ex,athe corresponding expectation; for simplicity, we set
Px,0=PxandEx,0=Ex.
Hence for any n≥1,
/tildewidePnΦ(x,a) =E[Φ(Ln,1·x,a+ln|Ln,1x|)] =Ex,a[Φ(Xn,Sn)].
Next we consider the restriction /tildewideP+toX×R+of/tildewidePdeﬁned for any ( x,a)∈X×Rby:
/tildewideP+Φ(x,a) =/tildewideP(Φ1X×R+)(x,a).
Let us emphasize that /tildewideP+may not be a Markov kernel on X×R+. Furthermore, if τ:= min{n≥
1 :Sn≤0}is the ﬁrst time the random process ( Sn)n≥1becomes non-positive, it holds for any
(x,a)∈X×R+and any bounded Borel function Φ : X×R→C,
/tildewideP+Φ(x,a) =Ex,a[Φ(X1,S1);τ >1] =E[Φ(g1·x,a+ln|g1·x|),a+ln|g1·x|>0].
A positive /tildewideP+-harmonic function Vis any function from X×R+toR+satisfying /tildewideP+V=V.
We extend Vby settingV(x,a) = 0 for ( x,a)∈X×R−
∗. In other words, the function Vis
/tildewideP+-harmonic if and only if for any x∈Xanda≥0,
V(x,a) =Ex,a[V(X1,S1);τ >1].
Similarly, let ˜ τ:= min{n≥1 :˜Sn≤0}be the ﬁrst time the random process ( ˜Sn)n≥1becomes
non-positive; for any ( x,b)∈˜X×R+and any bounded Borel function Ψ : ˜X×R→C,
E˜x,b[Ψ(˜X1,˜S1);˜τ >1] =E[Ψ(˜x·g1,b−ln|˜x·g1|);b−ln|˜x·g1|>0].
From Theorem II.1 in [14], under conditions P1-P3 introduce d below, there exists a unique
probability measure νonXsuch that for any bounded Borel function ϕfromXtoR,
(µ∗ν)(ϕ) =/integraldisplay
S/integraldisplay
Xϕ(g·x)ν(dx)µ(dg) =/integraldisplay
Xϕ(x)ν(dx) =ν(ϕ).

associated with µis ﬁnite and is expressed by
γµ=/integraldisplay
S/integraldisplay
Xρ(g,x)ν(dx)µ(dg).
We are now able to give a precise deﬁnition of a lattice distri butionµ. We say that the
measureµislatticeif there exists t>0,ǫ∈[0,2π[ and a function ψ:X→Rsuch that
∀g∈Tµ,∀x∈ψ(Tµ),exp{itρ(g,x)−iǫ+i(ψ(g·x)−ψ(x))}= 1, (2.1)
whereTµis the closed sub-semigroup generated by the support of µ.
It is also noticeable that the process ( Xn,Sn)nis a semi-markovian random walk on X×R
with the strictly positive variance σ2:= lim
n→+∞1
nEx[S2
n], for anyx∈X. Condition P2implies
thatσ2>0; we refer to Theorem 5 in [14].
In [21], we establish the asymptotic behaviour of P(τx,a>n) by studying the /tildewideP+-harmonic
functionV. Firstly, we prove the existence of a /tildewideP+-harmonic function properties.
Proposition 2.1 Assume hypotheses P1-P5. Then there exists a /tildewideP+-harmonic Borel function
V:X×R+→R+, such that t/ma√sto→V(x,t)is increasing on R+for anyx∈Xand satisﬁes the
following properties: there exist c,C >0andA>0such that for any x∈Xanda≥0,
c∨(a−A)≤V(x,a)≤C(1+a) and lim
a→+∞V(x,a)
a= 1.
Furthermore, for any x∈X,a≥0andn≥1,
√nP(τx,a>n)≤C V(x,a)
and asn→+∞,

2πnV(x,a).
At last, asn→+∞, the sequence/parenleftbigga+ln|Ln,1x|
σ√n/parenrightbigg
nconditioned to (τx,a>n)converges weakly
towards the Rayleigh distribution on R+whose density equals y e−y2/21R+(y), relatively to Px,a
for anyx∈Xanda>0.
2.2 Product of positive random matrices in Sδ
Foranyﬁxed B >1, letSBdenotethesubsetof Sthatincludesmatrices satisfying P3. Products
of random matrices are ﬁrst studied by H. Furstenberg and H. K esten [8] for matrices in SBand
then being extended to elements of Sby several authors (see [14] and references therein). The
restrictive condition of H. Furstenberg and H. Kesten consi derably simpliﬁes the study. The
following statement (see [8] Lemma 2) is a key argument in the sequel to control the asymptotic
behaviour of the norm of products of matrices of SB. LetTSBbe the semi-group generated by
the setSB.
7Lemma 2.2 For anyg∈TSBand1≤i,j,k,l≤p,
g(i,j)B2
≍g(k,l). (2.2)
In particular, there exist δ>1such that for any g,h∈TSBandx∈X,˜y∈˜X,
1.|gx|δ≍ |g|and|˜yg|δ≍ |g|,
2.|/tildewideygx|δ≍ |g|,
3.|g||h|δ
/√re⌋edesequal |gh| ≤ |g||h|.
As a direct consequence, the sequence (ln |Ln,1x| −ln|Ln,1|)n≥0is bounded uniformly in
x∈X. This property is crucial in the sequel in order to apply the “ reverse time” trick, an
essential argument in the proofs of our main results.
When studying ﬂuctuations of random walks ( Sn)n≥1with i.i.d. increments YkonRd,d≥1,
it is useful to “reverse time” as follows. For any 1 ≤k≤n, the random variables Sn−Sk=
Yk+1+...+YnandSn−k=Y1+...+Yn−khave the same distribution. In the case of products
of random matrices, the cocycle property Sn(x) = ln|Ln,1(x)|=Sk(x) +Sn−k(Xk) is more
subtle and the same argument cannot be applied directly. The fact that the gkbelong to Sδ
comes to our rescue here, but the price to pay is the appearanc e of the constant ∆ = ln δthat
disturbs the estimates as follows. Up to this constant ∆, we c an compare the distribution of
Sn(x)−Sk(x) =:Sn−k(Xk) to the one of ln |gk+1...gn|, then to the one of ln |g1...gn−k|and
at last to the one of ln |˜yg1...gn−k|=:−˜Sn−k(y), for anyx,y∈X(notice here that for this
last quantity, the non-commutativity of the product of matr ices forces us to consider the right
linear action of the matrices R1,n−k). It is the strategy that we apply repeatedly to obtain the
following result.
Recall that ∆ = ln δwhereδ>1 is the constant which appears in Lemma 2.2.
Lemma 2.3 For anyx,y∈X,a,b≥0andℓ>0,
Px,a(τ >n,S n∈[b,b+ℓ])≤P˜y, b+ℓ+∆(˜τ >n,˜Sn∈[a,a+ℓ+2∆]). (2.3)
Similarly, for a≥ℓ>2∆>0andb≥∆,
Px,a(τ >n,S n∈[b,b+ℓ])≥P˜y, b−∆(˜τ >n,˜Sn∈[a−ℓ,a−2∆]). (2.4)
Proof. We begin with the demonstration of (2.3). For any n∈N,b >0 andh >0, it follows
that
Px,a(τ >n, S n∈[b,b+ℓ])
=Px(a+S1>0,...,a+Sn−1>0,a+Sn∈[b,b+ℓ])
=Px(a+Sn−Sn−1◦θ>0,...,a+Sn−S1◦θn−1>0,a+Sn∈[b,b+ℓ])
≤Px(b+ℓ−Sn−1◦θ>0,...,b+ℓ−S1◦θn−1>0,b+ℓ−Sn∈[a,a+ℓ]),
whereθis the shift operator and Sn−k◦θk= ln|Ln,k+1Xx
k|Px-a.s. for any 0 ≤k≤n−
1. By Lemma 2.2, the quantities ln |Ln,k+1Xx
k|and ln|˜yLn,k+1|both belong to the interval
8[ln|Ln,k+1|−∆,ln|Ln,k+1|] for any ˜y∈˜Xand 0≤k≤n−1. Therefore Sn−k◦θk∈[ln|˜yLn,k+1|−
∆;ln|˜yLn,k+1|+∆] and as a result
Px,a(τ >n, S n∈[b,b+ℓ])
≤P(b+ℓ+∆−ln|˜yLn,2|>0,...,b+ℓ+∆−ln|˜yLn,n|>0,
b+ℓ+∆−ln|˜yLn,1| ∈[a,a+ℓ+2∆])
=P(b+ℓ+∆−ln|˜yR1,n−1|>0,...,b+ℓ+∆−ln|˜yR1,1|>0,
b+ℓ+∆−ln|˜yR1,n| ∈[a,a+ℓ+2∆])
by using the fact that ( g1,...,gn) and (gn,...,g1) have the same distribution
=P˜y, b+ℓ+∆(˜τ >n,˜Sn∈[a,a+ℓ+2∆]).
Similarly, for a>ℓ>2∆>0 andb>0, we obtain the proof of (2.4) as follows.
Px,a(τ >n, S n∈[b,b+ℓ])
=Px(a+S1>0,...,a+Sn−1>0,a+Sn∈[b,b+ℓ])
=Px(a+Sn−Sn−1◦θ>0,...,a+Sn−S1◦θn−1>0,b≤a+Sn≤b+ℓ)
≥Px(b−Sn−1◦θ>0,...,b−S1◦θn−1>0,a−ℓ≤b−Sn≤a)
≥P(b−∆−ln|˜yLn,2|>0,...,b−∆−ln|˜yLn,n|>0,
a−ℓ≤b−∆−ln|˜yLn,1| ≤a−2∆)
=P(b−∆−ln|˜yR1,n−1|>0,...,b−∆−ln|˜yR1,1|>0,
b−∆−ln|˜yR1,n| ∈[a−ℓ,a−2∆])
=P˜y, b−∆(˜S1>0,...,˜Sn−1>0,˜Sn∈[a−ℓ,a−2∆])
=P˜y, b−∆(˜τ >n,˜Sn∈[a−ℓ,a−2∆]).
Sincea>ℓ>2∆>0, the interval [ a−ℓ,a−2∆] is not empty.

where the convergence is uniform in (x,a)∈X×R.
We also need other elementary estimations whose proof is det ailed.
Lemma 2.5 There exist constants c,C >0such that for every x∈X,a,b,ℓ> 0andn≥1,
Px,a(Sn∈[b,b+ℓ])≤c√nℓ. (2.5)
9and furthermore, for any t>0, if|a−b|>t√nthen
Px,a(Sn∈[b,b+ℓ])≤C√nℓ e−ct2. (2.6)
Proof.Assertion (2.5) is a consequence of Theorem 2.4 above. Asser tion (2.6) is a more precise
overestimation than (2.5) for large values of the starting p ointa, namely when a/{ollowsequal√n, as
proved below.
We ﬁxh,t >0 and letm:=⌊n/2⌋be the lower round of n/2. We decompose Px,a(Sn∈
[b,b+ℓ]) as follows.
Px,a(Sn∈[b,b+ℓ]) =Px(a+Sn∈[b,b+ℓ])

P2(n,x,a,b,ℓ ).
On the one hand, from the Markov property, inequality (2.5) a nd the central limit theorem for
products of random matrices [14], there exists a strictly po sitive constant csuch that, uniformly
inx,aandb,
P1(n,x,a,b,ℓ ) =/integraldisplay

On the other hand, when |a−b|> t√n, the conditions |Sm| ≤t√n/2 anda+Sn∈[b,b+ℓ]
yield|Sn−Sm| ≥t√n/2−ℓ. Hence, for ﬁxed handnlarge enough,

The next statement is analogous to the previous lemma when th e walk (a+Sn)nis forced
to remain positive up to time n.
10Lemma 2.6 There exists a constant C >0such that for all x∈X,a,b≥0,ℓ>0andn≥1,
Px,a(τ >n,S n∈[b,b+ℓ])≤CV(x,a)ℓ

Furthermore, there exists a constant C >0such that for any ℓ,t>0,n≥1,a>ℓ+2∆+t√n
andb>max{t√n,∆},
Px,a(τ≤n,Sn∈[b,b+ℓ])≤Cℓ√ne−ct2. (2.8)

Step 2. We control the term Px,a(m<τ≤n,Sn∈[b,b+ℓ]). By using the same argument

Px,a(m<τ≤n, Sn∈[b,b+ℓ])
=Px(∃k∈ {m+1,...,n−1}:a+Sk≤0,a+Sn∈[b,b+ℓ])

(by using again the fact that ( g1,...,gn) and (gn,...,g1) have the same distribution)

Theorem 1.1 follows by combining these three steps; the conv ergence is obviously uniform over

We setm=⌊n/2⌋.

P1=Px,a(τ >n,S m≤A√m,Sn∈[b,b+ℓ])
and
P2=Px,a(τ >n,S m>A√m,Sn∈[b,b+ℓ]).

154 Proof of Theorem 1.2
Inequality (1.2) is proved in [19] Corollary 3.7. The proof o f the lower bound (1 .3) is based on
Theorem 1.1 and is valid for ℓ>2∆+1 and b≥∆. As previously, we set m=⌊n/2⌋. By the

Hence, inequality (4.1) yields, for nlarge enough,

which implies, for such n,

This achieves the proof of inequality (1.3), taking for inst anceℓ0= 4∆+2.
