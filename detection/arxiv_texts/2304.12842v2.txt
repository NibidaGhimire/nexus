Abstract: Understanding the spin structure of hadrons in the small xregime is an
important direction to unravel the spin puzzle in hadronic physics. To include spin degrees
of freedom in the small xregime requires going beyond the usual eikonal approximation in
high energy QCD. We developed an effective Hamiltonian approach to study spin related
observables in the small xregime using the shockwave formalism. The small- xeffective
Hamiltonian incorporates both quark and gluon propagators in the background fields and
the background field induced interaction vertices up to next-to-eikonal order. A novel
feature of sub-eikonal interactions is the background gluon field induced gluon radiation
inside the shockwave. Its relation to chromo-electrically polarized Wilson line correlator is
established both in small xhelicity evolution and in longitudinal double-spin asymmetry
for gluon production.arXiv:2304.12842v2  [hep-ph]  6 Jul 2023Contents

– 1 –1 Introduction
Understanding the spin structure of proton is one of the central problems in hadronic
physics. Since the discovery by the European Muon Collaboration (EMC) [1] showing
that quark’s intrinsic spin only contributes to a small portion of proton’s spin, many
experimental and theoretical efforts were devoted to understanding the proton spin puzzle
[2–5]. Theoretical studies [6, 7] point out that besides quark’s intrinsic spin, gluon’s intrinsic
spin (helicity), quark and gluon orbital angular momentum can contribute to proton spin.
To study the fraction of proton’s spin from gluon, significant advancement was made by the
RHIC spin program [3, 8] at the Brookhaven National Laboratory measuring the double-
spin asymmetry for particle and jet productions in longitudinally polarized proton-proton
collisions. Including some of the experimental measurements into theoretical global analysis
for extracting parton distribution functions f(x, Q2) found that gluons in the range 0 .05<
x <1 constitute approximately 40% of the proton’s spin at Q2= 10 GeV [9–11]. Estimating
and constraining gluon helicity distribution at even smaller values of xis currently under
active theoretical study [12] and it is also one of the main goals of the future Electron-Ion
Collider experiment [4].
The collinear factorization formalism has been the cornerstone to study the double-
spin asymmetry in longitudinally polarized proton-proton collisions, dating back to the
tree-level partonic cross sections first incorporated in [13, 14]. More recently, global analy-
sis based on generalization to next-to-leading order perturbative QCD contributions within
the collinear factorization framework are carried out in [9–11]. This approach is partic-
ularly applicable when the produced particles and jets have large transverse momentum.
However, inclusive particle and jet productions with large transverse momentum, especially
in the midrapidity, are usually insensitive to gluons at small xwhose typical transverse
momentum are the gluon saturation scale Qsin the saturation regime [15–17]. To probe
gluon helicity at smaller x, one needs to include effect of multiple scattering with small
xgluons and concentrates on particle/jet productions at moderate values of transverse
momentum. Unfortunately, the collinear factorization formalism ceases to be applicable
for particle and jet productions with transverse momentum around Qs. A more general
transverse momentum dependent treatment beyond the collinear factorization formalism
is desired.
To faciliate calculating spin related observables in the small xlimit directly within
the transverse momentum depdendent framework, we develop an effective Hamiltonian ap-
proach within the shockwave formalism. This approach is inspired by the seminal work
[18], in which the authors studied high energy QED in external fields. We derived the
small- xeffective Hamiltonian that describes high energy QCD processes up to sub-eikonal
order. As is well known, leading order QCD processes in the high energy limit (eikonal
approximation) are insensitive to spin degrees of freedom. To probe the spin of quarks and
gluons inside the proton, one has to go beyond the eikonal approximation. We work in
the shockwave formalism, treating the proton as background quark and gluon fields. The
light-cone Hamiltonian for QCD in the background fields is then expanded in the eikonality
parameter ξ=e−∆Ywith ∆ Ybeing the rapdity differerence between the projectile and
– 2 –target. The effective light-cone Hamiltonian up to linear order in ξis sufficient to calculate
spin related observables at small x. This effective Hamiltonian contains both propagators
and effective interaction vertices for quarks and gluons. The quadratic terms in the effec-
tive Hamiltonian automatically generate the single quark and the single gluon scattering
amplitudes at small x, the so-called polarized Wilson lines that have already been obtained
in the literature by several groups [12, 19–22]. There are three different interaction vertices
in the effective Hamiltonian. At the order ξ1/2, one has the background quark field induced
quark-gluon conversion. At the order ξ, one has the background gluon field induced quark-
antiquark-gluon vertex and gluon-gluon-gluon vertex. These three vertices are responsible
for the additional complications and new features in spin related observables at small x.
The three-particle interaction vertex induced by the background gluon field predicts
that gluon could be emitted inside the shockwave at the sub-eikonal order. It is a new
feature compared to the well-known physics at the eikonal order in which gluons are only
allowed to be radiated either before or after interacting with the shockwave. This intro-
duces additional contributions when calculating particle productions in polarized collisions
and evaluating small xrapidity evolutions of various transverse momentum dependent dis-
tribution functions [23, 24]. To determine the significance of this phenomenon, we have
performed explicit calculations of the process wherein a soft gluon is emitted inside a
shockwave and have derived its contribution to the double-spin asymmetry for soft gluon
production. Additionally, we have computed how the emission of gluons inside the shock-
wave affects the rapidity evolution of polarized Wilson line correlators. In both cases, we
found that this effect is manifested in terms of the chromo-electrically polarized Wilson
line correlator ⟨Tr[UiG[2]
xU†
y]⟩, which has been shown to be directly related to the small x
limit of gluon helicity TMD [12].
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, the small- xeffective Hamiltonian of
QCD together with the formalism to calculate scattering processes at the sub-eikonal order
are developed. As an application of this formalism, the single quark/gluon scattering
amplitudes at the sub-eikonal order are reproduced in Sec. 3. Sec. 4 is devoted to study
the significance of gluon radiation inside the shockwave. Discussions and conclusions are
given in Sec. 5.
2 Small- xEffective Hamiltonian
There are several approaches to study QCD at small x. The most widely used approach
is to start from the full QCD theory, calculate physical quantities and relevant Feynmann
diagrams and finally take the small xlimit, typically by setting the center-of-mass collision
energy√sto be very large. However, we follow a different approach. Rather than using
the complete QCD theory, we initially determine the effective QCD Hamiltonian, which
is only applicable in the small xlimit. We then utilize this small- xeffective Hamiltonian
to directly compute interesting physical quantities in the small xlimit. To study small x
physics, we adopt the shockwave formalism, which treats the target as background quark
and gluon fields in the collision with the projectile. This enables us to describe the collision
– 3 –processes using QCD theory in background fields. This approach is the same as high-energy
scatterings by external fields, wherein the external fields are highly Lorentz contracted.

Let the QCD Lagrangian density be

µta
is defined in the fundamental representation of the SU(3) color group. The fermion mass
is denoted by m.
In the spirit of shockwave formalism, the nuclear target is characterized as classical
gluon and quark fields in the small xlimit. Denoting the background gluon fields and
quark fields as aa
µandψrespectively, one makes the substitution

The field strength tensor in the background field is defined as Fµν=DµAν− D νAµ+
ig[Aµ, Aν]. The covariant derivatives in the background field are− →Dµ=∂µ+igaµand← −Dµ=← −∂µ−igaµ. The background fields are assumed to satisfy classical equations of motion.
Here fµν=∂µaν−∂νaµ+ig[aµ, aν]. We use caligraphic letters to indicate expressions in
which the ordinary derivative ∂µis replaced by covariant derivative Dµin the background
field aµonly.
We would like to obtain the corresponding Hamiltonian density from the Lagrangian
density in eq. (2.3) in the light-cone gauge A+= 0. Although the precise dynamics of the
background fields themselves are not relevant to the current discussions, we also require that
a+= 01. In the light-cone gauge, the field components A−,ΨB=PBΨ are dependent fields
and they can be expressed in terms of the independent fields Ai,ΨG=PGΨ [26, 27]. Here
the spinor space projection operators are defined as PG=1
2γ−γ+,PB=1
2γ+γ−. One has
the decomposition of quark field into good component and bad component Ψ = Ψ G+ Ψ B.

containing a+are even higher orders in eikonality and will not contribute to effective Hamiltonin up to
sub-eikonal order.

terms represent the energy density from chromoelectromagnetic fields in the background
fields. The third term characterizes the background gluon fields induced mass term for the
dynamical gluon fields. The fourth term is the ususal coupling of the current J+a−with
the background fields. The fifth term characterizes fermions’ contribution to the energy
density. The last two terms describe the conversion between quarks and gluons induced by
background fermion fields.
Plugging eqs. (2.6) and (2.7) into eq. (2.5), the light-cone Hamiltonian density H=

Our focus lies in studying interactions that occur up to sub-eikonal order in high energy
QCD. However, not all interaction terms in eq. (2.11) contribute to sub-eikonal order.
Hence, it becomes imperative to identify and isolate the sub-eikonal contributions. To
achieve this, we introduce the eikonality parameter and proceed to expand the Hamiltonian
as a power series expansion in terms of this parameter in the subsequent section.
2.2 Expansion in eikonality
The light-cone Hamiltonian obtained in the previous section is
H=Z
d2xdx−H=H0+V=H0+V0+VB. (2.12)
Recall the definition of S-matrix operator
ˆS≡S(+∞,−∞) =Pexp
−iZ+∞
−∞dz+VI(z+)
. (2.13)
S-matrrix element is calculated by Sfi=⟨ϕf|ˆS|ϕi⟩with|ϕi⟩and⟨ϕf|being the eigen-
states of free Hamiltonian H0at asymptotic time x+=−∞ andx+= +∞respec-
tively. The interaction terms of the Hamiltonian in the interaction picture is defined by
VI(z+) =eiH0(z+−z+
0)V(z+
0)e−iH0(z+−z+
0)with z+
0the reference time. We further assume the
interaction with background fields only happen within the range [ x+, x+
0]. The S-matrix
operator thus has the factorized form ˆS=S(+∞, x+)S(x+, x+
0)S(x+
0,−∞) in which VB
only contributes to S(x+, x+
0).
We are particularly interested in states that have large longitudinal momentum. To
obtain these states, we boost the states |ϕi⟩and⟨ϕf|. Mathematically, it is implemented
by
|ϕi⟩B=e−iωˆK3|ϕi⟩. (2.14)
Here ˆK3is the Lorentz boost operator along the zdirection and the parameter ωchar-
acterizes the amount of boost. Noted that the boosted states are still eigenstates of the
light-cone Hamiltonian because ˆH0e−iωˆK3|ϕi⟩=e−ωe−iωˆK3ˆH0|ϕi⟩= (e−ωEi)e−iωˆK3|ϕi⟩
with the help of eiωˆK3ˆH0e−iωˆK3=e−ωˆH0[18, 27].
– 6 –To calculate S-matrix element between highly boosted states, instead of directly boost-
ing the states, it is convenient to shift the boosting to the interactions [18].

To increase the collision energy in a scattering process, one can either boost the projectile
or boost the target in the opposite direction. For the interaction with background fields,
we find it convenient to boost the background fields instead of directly boosting the states.
For that, we will need to reverse the sign of the boost parameter in the above expressions
ω→ −ω. We also introduce the rescaled lightcone time ˜ x+=eωx+. The S-matrix element
in eq. (2.15) becomes
Sfi=⟨ϕf|Pexp
−iξZ+∞
−∞d˜z+eVI(˜z+)
|ϕi⟩ (2.17)
Here the interaction with background fields is first boosted and then transformed into the
interaction picture by
eV(˜z+
0) =e−iωK3V(z+
0)eiωK3,
eVI(˜z+) =eiH0(˜z+−˜z+
0)eV(˜z+
0)e−iH0(˜z+−˜z+
0).(2.18)
We have introduced the eikonality parameter ξ=e−ωin eq. (2.17). Identifying ξ=e−∆Y
with the rapidity difference between the projectile and target ∆ Y=|YP−YT|, the high
energy limit ∆ Y→ ∞ corresponds to ξ→0. In the case of deep inelastic scattering in
which the Bjorken small-x parameter is defined by x=Q2
2P·qwith P2=m2
Nandq2=−Q2,
the eikonality parameter is found to be linearly related to the small-x Bjorken parameter
ξ=xe−mN
Q. Therefore, the eikonality parameter is nothing but the small- xparameter up
to a positive constant multiplicative factor.
Consequently, calculating the S-matrix element in the high energy limit is equivalent
to expanding eq. (2.17) as power series expansion in ξ. As we will explicitly demonstrate
in the following, the background field boosted interaction term has the expansion
ξeVI(˜z+) =eVI,(0)(˜z+) +ξ1
2eVI,(1
2)(˜z+) +ξeVI,(1)(˜z+) +. . . (2.19)
Denoting the leading eikonal interaction operator as
ˆW(˜x+,˜x+
0) =Pexp(
−iZ˜x+
˜x+
0d˜z+eVI,(0)(˜z+))
, (2.20)
– 7 –one can then expand the S-matrix operator up to first order in ξfrom eqs.(2.17) and (2.19)

(2.21)
Eq. (2.21) is the main result of the this section. It is the starting point for calculating
various scattering amplitudes up to next-to-eikonal order. It should be pointed out that the
Wilson line operator eq. (2.20) contains sub-eikonal contributions due to the transformation
to interaction picture given in eq. (2.18). See detailed discussions in appendix C in which
these sub-eikonal contributions can be equivalently absorbed into V(1). In the following
section, the expressions of V(0), V(1
2), V(1)are derived.
2.3 Effective light-cone Hamiltonian up to sub-eikonal order
The transformations of quark and gluon fields under Lorentz boost are (see appendix A
and also [19, 20])
a−−→ea−=eωa−(eωx+, e−ωx−,x),
ai−→eai=ai(eωx+, e−ωx−,x),
ψG−→eψG=e−ω/2ψG(eωx+, e−ωx−,x),
ψB−→eψB=eω/2ψB(eωx+, e−ωx−,x).(2.22)
The field strength tensor transforms as
f+i−→ef+i=e−ωf+i(eωx+, e−ωx−,x),
fij−→efij=fij(eωx+, e−ωx−,x).(2.23)
We study the interaction with background fields given in eq. (2.11) and examine how it
transforms under the the transformations (2.22) and (2.23). We will perform power series
expansion in ξ=e−ωand keep terms up to zeroth order in ξ. Note that we already have
a factor ξin the exponential of eq. (2.17).
Before analyzing each term, we first look at the factors involving inverse derivative and
– 8 –see how they transform by boosting the background fields.

In the last equality, we have performed Taylor expansion in powers of ξ. The first term
is the well-known eikonal interaction. The other two terms are sub-eikonal interactions
containing derivatives with repsect to the background fields and the dynamical fields. The
second term characterizes longitudinal momentum exchange between projectile and the
shockwave (see appendix C for its contribution to single particle scattering amplitude).
Such process will not interfere with the eikonal order amplitude which on the other hand
preserves longitudinal momentum of the projectile. The third term represents sub-eikonal
contributions that will be equivalently included by the sub-eikonal order Wilson line oper-
ator transformations demonstrated in appendix C. We therefore ignore these two terms in
the following discussions.

It is interesting to note that at the sub-eikonal level, the triple vertices, either three-gluon
vertices or quark-antiquark-gluon vertices are induced only by the background tranverse
gluon fields, see Fig. 2. In eq. (2.38), we have combined these background field induced
triple interaction vertices with the corresponding vacuum triple interaction terms that
contain ordinary spatial partial derivatives (given in eq. (2.9)). These combinations lead
to interaction terms that depend on the covariant derivative Dirather than simply the
background gauge potential ai. When computing physical observables, gauge covariance
becomes apparent with the help of these combinations.
For the terms quadratic in the dynamical fields in eq.(2.38), we have also included the
vacuum terms −1
2Ai∂l∂lAiand−i√
2Ψ†
G∂l∂l1
∂−ΨG. These terms describe sub-eikonal order
of the vacuum free propagator although they are independent of the background fields. In
– 12 –appendix C, it is shown that these terms are indeed sub-eikonal as they come from sub-
eikonal order Wilson line operator transformation. More explanation will be given in the
following section when computing single particle scattering amplitude. The upshot is that
the dependence on the background gluon field aiis either through fijorDi, maintaining
explicit gauge covariance.
The effective interaction is expressed purely in terms of independent dynamical fields
Ai,ΨG. In the following, we will quantize the theory by substituting the modes expansion
of these fields eqs. (B.1), see appendix B for details. The quadratic terms provide the
effective propagators for the gluon and the quark. The triple interaction terms represent
background field induced three-field interaction.
3 Single Particle Scattering Amplitude
In this section, we calculate the various scattering amplitudes up to sub-eikonal order for
single (anti) quark and gluon propagating through the background fields. The formula
in eq. (2.21) is our starting point. Since the tilded coordinates in eq. (2.21) are dummy
variables and we have already performed Lorentz boosting on the background fields to
obtain the interaction terms up to sub-eikonal order, we therefore ignore the tilde in all
symbols in the following discussion for notational simplicity.
3.1 Single (anti)quark scattering amplitude
The scattering amplitude for a single quark propagating through the background fields is
⟨q|ˆS|q⟩ ≡Mq→q({p′+,x′, m′, σ′};{p+,x, m, σ}) =
0ˆbm′,σ′(p′+,x′)ˆSˆb†
m,σ(p+,x)0
(3.1)
The incoming quark has color index mand spin index σ, longitudinal momentum k+and
transverse coordinate x. The corresponding primed quantities characterize the outgoing
quark. The ˆb†is quark creation operator. Substituting eq. (2.21) into eq. (3.1), there are
three terms in the eikonality expansion of ˆSthat contribute up to sub-eikonal order. The
first term is the eikonal interaction with the background fields

We have substituted the portion of V(1)that is quadratic in quark fields from eq. (2.38)
together with the mode expansion for quark field given in eq. (B.1). The transformation
to interaction picture introduces higher order contributions in eikonality, so it is safe to set
V(1),I=V(1)in the above calculations.

Expanding the phase factor to linear order, one gets eq. (3.10). When computing cross sec-
tion by squaring scattering amplitudes, these vacuum contributions should be subtracted.
The lesson is that there are two sources of sub-eikonal physics. One is dynamical, genuinely
related to the interactions with background fields at the sub-eikonal order. The other is
kinematic, which is just the sub-eikonal order expansion of the free propagator phase, hav-
ing nothing to do with the background fields. In principle, one should replace← −Dl− →Dlby
(← −Dl− →Dl−← −∂l− →∂l) for the interaction terms in eq. (2.38). However, retaining the covariant
derivatives← −Dl− →Dlautomatically keeps track of sub-eikonal contributions from free propa-
gators. In appendix C, it is shown that the← −∂l− →∂lterm can be equivalently reproduced by
the sub-eikonal order contributions to Wilson line operator transformation due to changing
to the interaction picture. As a result, one can keep the← −Dl− →Dlterm as the sub-eikonal
interaction and only use the eikonal order Wilson line operator transformation.
– 15 –For single antiquark scattering amplitude, one can repeat the above calculations or
making charge conjugation transformation on eq. (3.7). The fundamental representation
color matrix changes as te→ −te∗so that the Wilson lines in fundamental representation
changes as Vm′m→V†
mm′. Under charge conjugation transformation, the Dirac bilinear
terms change as
¯ψγ−ψ(y)−→ − ¯ψ(y)γ−ψ(x),
¯ψγ−γ5ψ(y)−→¯ψ(y)γ−γ5ψ(x).(3.12)
3.2 Single gluon scattering amplitude
For the single gluon scattering amplitude up to sub-eikonal order, one can perform similar
calculations as have been done in the above section, starting from eq. (2.21). We only
present the final result here.

3.3 Background field induced quark-gluon conversion
When computing particle and jet productions in polarized collision, one has to consider
background field induced quark-gluon converting processes like g↔qandg↔¯q, see
– 16 –Fig. 1. These subprocesses, representing order ξ1
2contribution, can happen in pair flexibly
in the scattering amplitude and the complex conjugate amplitude to make the final cross
section be at order ξ. This flexibility typically increases the number of Feynman diagrams
and introduces delicate cancellation among certain set of diagrams. This flexibility might
also induce extra contributions to small xrapidity evolution [20]. The background field
induced quark-gluon conversion responsible for quark-gluon dijet production in deep in-
elastic electron-proton scatterings was recently investigated in [28]. For future reference,
we present the explicit expressions for these subprocesses in this section.
For gluon to quark conversion, substituting the interaction V(1
2)from eq. (2.37), one
obtains

(3.17)
The gluon-quark conversion process preserves the longitudinal momentum and transverse
coordinates. It only changes the color and spin quantum numbers. After factorizing out
the Dirac delta functions, the conversion amplitude is

3.4 Quark-antiquark pair converted to two gluons
Using the eikonality expansion of the S matrix operator from eq. (2.21), one can also
compute the sub-eikonal process that a pair of quark and antiquark is converted into two
gluons ⟨gg|ˆS|q¯q⟩, see Fig. 3. In principle, one can obtain the amplitude Mq¯q→ggas the
product of two amplitudes computed in eqs. (3.20) and (3.21)
Mq¯q→gg=Mq→gM¯q→g. (3.22)
However, we would like to demonstrate that this process can be directly computed from
the eikonality expansion of the S matrix operator in eq. (2.21), thus providing further
evidence on the validity of the expansion.

a photon/gluon splitting. We have used the spinor space identity

4 Gluon Radiation Inside the Shockwave
The small xeffective Hamiltonian derived in Sec. 2.3 predicts that gluon radiation inside
the shockwave, induced by background gluon fields, contributes to physical processes at
sub-eikonal order. In this section, we discuss two specific situations in which gluon radiation
inside the shock contributes. One is about double-spin asymmetry for soft gluon production
in longitudinally polarized collisions. The other is about small xrapidity evolution of
chrormo-magnetically polarized Wilson line correlator. It is noted that gluon radiation
inside the shockwave has been incorporated in studying gluon TMD evolution in [23, 24].
In the context of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions, medium induced gluon radiation
has also been studied in [29, 30].
4.1 Longitudinal double-spin asymmetry for soft gluon production
For the incoming gluon we use c, λ, p+,pto denote its color, polarization and momentum.
For the two outgoing gluons their color, polarization and momentum are c1, λ1, p+
1,p1and
c2, λ2, p+
2,p2, respectively. It is easier to do calculations in the mixed representation in
which longitudinal momentum and transverse positions are used. We thus denote the
corresponding transverse coordinates of the incoming and outgoing gluons as x0,x1,x2.
We focus on the situation that one of the outgoing gluons is in the midrapidity region. The
longitudinal momenta satisfy p+
1≪p+
2∼p+orp+
1=zp+with z→0.
We calculate the first diagram in Fig. 4, representing the interference term between
eikonal order initial state gluon radiation and the sub-eikonal order gluon radiation inside
the shockwave. The eikonal order gluon radiation amplitude is computed as
M2=δ(x0−x2)(igfce1e2)(2δλλ2εj∗
λ1)i
2π(x1−x0)j
|x1−x0|2Uc1e1x1Uc2e2x0. (4.1)
For gluon radiation inside the shockwave, the amplitude is computed using the formula

Here ˆVgggarepresent the background field induced triple gluon interaction vertex given
in eq. (2.38). For the two contributing vertices in eq. (2.38), one is local in longitudinal
coordinate while the other one is nonlocal.
Eq. (4.2) needs to be simplified by taking the limit z→0 with p+
1=zp+. In fact,
terms that contain the polarization factor δλλ2εi∗
λ1can be ignored because these terms do
not communicate polarization of the incoming gluon to the outgoing gluons, leading to final
result independent of the incoming gluon polarization, thus won’t contribute to double-spin
asymmetry. It is interesting to note that these terms happen to involve the factor 1 /zin
the soft gluon limit.
There is the possible combination that the 1 /zorder gluon radiation inside the shock-
wave in the amplitude can combine with the complex conjugate amplitude in which the
– 21 –next-to-eikonal (order z, see appendix B for explicit expression) gluon is radiated either
before or after eikonal scatterings. This combination turns out to give exactly the same
result as the eq. (4.5).
Only keeping terms at z0order and excluding terms proportional to δλλ2εi∗

simplified expression of M3contributing to double-spin asymmetry is

of Tr[ Ui G[2]

Eq. (4.5) is the main result of this section, which clearly shows that gluon radia-
tion inside the shockwave contribute to longitudinal double-spin asymmetry in soft gluon
production. Furthermore, its contribution is in the form of chromo-electrically polarized
Wilson line correlator.
4.2 Small xevolution of polarized Wilson line correlator
In this section, we calculate the amplitude shown in Fig. 5. They come from one step rapid-
ity evolution of the chromo-magnetically polarized gluon dipole correlator ⟨Tr[UG[1]
x1U†
x2]⟩.
The two diagrams represent contributions from gluon radiation inside the shockwave. We
use two different methods to do the calculations. One is an operator treatment that was
used by many groups [12, 23, 31]. The other method is to directly compute the two dia-
grams.

The field strength tensor f12carries longitudinal momentum k+. We decomposed it into
a quantum part and a classical part by ai(k+)→Ai(k′+) +ai(k+−δk+) with k+−
δk+< k′+< k+. One then integrates out the quantum degrees of freedom Ai(k′+) in the
infinitesimal strip of longitudinal momentum δk+. The separation into classical fields and
quantum fluctuations is given by

Let the shockwave locate within the narrow range [ −L+, L+] around 0+. We further require
that−L+< x+
1< L+. In other words, the chromo-magnetic field lies inside the shockwave.
The situations that the chromo-magnetic field lies before or after the shockwave have been
studied in [12].
The eikonal Wilson line Ux2also needs to be expanded to linear order in quantum
fluctuation field

The incoming two gluons have the same color indices. The same is true for the two outgoing
gluons. The two outgoing gluons also have the same polarization. Repeated indices are

coordinates different.
The first term in eq. (4.34), only considering the part corresponding to the first diagram

the longitudinal momentum conservation leads to p+

1as expected for sub-eikonal
order processes. We only kept the part of the polarization factor that will eventually give
terms linear in the polarization of the incoming gluons. The initial state gluon splitting
wavefunction ψg→gg

longitudinal momentum conservation enforces that p+

The results of the two amplitudes coincide with eq. (4.33). From the above expression, one
can see that there is no tranvserse coordinate integration. Therefore, these two diagrams
only contribute in the single logarithmic approximation [32].
One could also draw diagrams as shown in Fig. 6. However, these two diagrams vanish
because the background field induced triple gluon vertex is local in transverse coordinates
while the soft gluon radiation is nonlocal in transverse coordinates.
We used two examples to show the importance of gluon radiation inside the shockwave.
It contributes both to the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry of soft gluon production
and to the rapidity evolution of polarized Wilson line correlator. It turns out that in
both cases, the final result is related to chromo-electrically polarized Wilson line correlator
⟨Tr[UiG[2]

by chromo-electric field f−i, is related to the small xlimit of gluon helicity TMD .
– 30 –5 Summary
In this paper, we have derived the small- xeffective Hamiltonian for QCD in high energy
within the shockwave formalism. The results are given in eqs. (2.36), (2.37), (2.38) valid
up to sub-eikonal order. The straightforward continuation of the analysis to higher orders
of eikonality is possible but probably very tedious. The use of a Hamiltonian approach to
investigate high energy QCD at the eikonal order can be found in [33, 34]. We also estab-
lished the approach to compute S-matrix elements up to sub-eikonal order in eq. (2.21). As
an application, various single quark/gluon scattering amplitudes, known as the polarized
Wilson lines, are reproduced. This effective Hamiltonian approach, alternative to other
approaches [12, 19, 21, 23] has the advantage of directly isolating the relevant interactions
up to sub-eikonal order and is particularly suitable to compute spin related observables at
small x.
The behavior of the eikonal interaction vertex eq. (2.36) under rapidity evolution had
been carefully examined before, leading to the derivation of the JIMWLK renormalization
group equation from a field theoretical approach in [35–38]. The JIMWLK equation is
general in the sense that it can be applied to any spin-independent observables at small
x. For example, applying the JIMWLK equation on dipole correlator generates the Bal-
itsky hierarchy and reproduces the BK equation in the large Nc[39, 40]. Currently, the
small xrapidity evolutions beyond eikonal order, particularly related to spin-dependent
observables, are analyzed in an observable-by-observable way. Since we have identified
the relevant interaction vertices and propagators at the sub-eikonal order in the small x
effective Hamiltonian, it would be very interesting though challenging to derive a general
renormalization group equation that is valid at sub-eikonal order and automatically repro-
duces the evolution equations when being applied to different observables [41, 42]. On the
other hand, the small xeffective Hamiltonian approach offers the possibility to bridge high
energy QCD to the general methodology in Hamiltonian formalism. As has been demon-
strated that JIMWLK equation can be reproduced by the quantum Lindblad equation
through quantum-classical correspondance [43, 44]. At the sub-eikonal order, the Hilbert
space is enlarged as spin related degrees of freedoms start playing roles . It would also be
very interesting to see if the Linblad formalism still applies to small xhelicity evolution
using the small xeffective Hamiltonian.
One of the new features of small- xeffective Hamiltonian at sub-eikonal order is that
gluons can be emitted inside the shockwave. This phenomenon has been barely discussed in
the literature. We studied its effect in two situations: longitudinal double-spin asymmetry
for soft gluon production in polarized collisions and rapidity evolution of polarized Wilson
lines. In both cases, it is found that the contribution is given by the chromo-electrically
polarized Wilson line correlator ⟨Tr[UiG[2]
xU†
y]⟩, which has been shown to be directly related
to gluon helicity TMD in the small xlimit. It would be very interesting to see how
gluon radiation inside the shockwave impacts the small xrapidity evolutions and particle
productions in phenomenological applications.
The small- xeffective Hamiltionian approach is developed within the light-cone quan-
tization framework. As a result, it inevitably inherits the same zero mode problem [26].
– 31 –Recently, it was brought out that the chiral anomaly in polarized inclusive deep inelastic
scatterings might be sensitive to zero modes [45, 46] (see also [47, 48]), which could have
been missed by the current approach. Nevertheless, the small- xeffective Hamiltonian ap-
proach provides a systematic way of directly computing spin related observables including
particle and jet productions in the small xlimit. Of particular interest is the double-spin
asymmetry for particle and jet productions in longitudinally polarized collisions relevant
to experimental measurements at RHIC [49–64]. This could include productions of neutral
pion, η-meson, charged pions and J/ψ at midrapidity, intermediate rapdity and forward
rapidity, respectively. Double-spin asymmetry for direct photon production has also been
measured at RHIC. Applications to deep inelastic scatterings relevant to future EIC would
also be very intersting. We plan to study these observables in future works.

A Boost Transformations of Vector and Spinor Fields
The vector fields and the spinor fields constitute different representations of the the Lorentz
group. Their transformations under boost are obtained explicitly in this section. The
general Lorentz group representation is
U(ωµν) = exp
−i
2ωµνJµν
. (A.1)
Here Jµνare the generators of the Lorentz group and ωµνare the corresponding tranfor-
mation parameters. It is antisymmetric tensor. The generators satisfy the commutation
relations h
Jµν, Jρσi
=i(gνρJµσ−gµρJνσ−gνσJµρ+gµσJνρ). (A.2)
For the vector representation, the generators have the following explicit expression
(Jµν)α
β=i(gµαδν
β−gναδµ
β). (A.3)
We are interested in the boost along z-axis, the transformation is
U(ω) =e−iωK3(A.4)
with
K3=J03=i
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0
. (A.5)
– 32 –One obtains
U(ω)≡Λ =
coshω0 0 sinh ω
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
sinhω0 0 cosh ω
. (A.6)
Under Lorentz boost, the gluon field transforms as eAµ(x) =U(ω)Aµ(Λ−1x). The explicit
expressions for each component are
eA+=eωA+(e−ωx+, eωx−,x⊥),
eA−=e−ωA−(e−ωx+, eωx−,x⊥),
eAi=Ai(e−ωx+, eωx−,x⊥).(A.7)
For the spinor representation U(ω) =e−i
2ωµνSµνwith the generators Sµν=i
4[γµ, γν], the
boost operation has the explicit expression
U(ω) =e−iωK3(A.8)
with
K3=S03=i
2γ0γ3. (A.9)
One can then obtain
U(ω) = sinhω
2γ0γ3+ coshω
2=eω
2PG+e−ω
2PB (A.10)
It is interesting to note that the good component ψG=PGψand the bad component
ψB=PBψtransform differently under Lorentz boost.
eψG=eω/2ψG(e−ωx+, eωx−,x⊥),
eψB=e−ω/2ψB(e−ωx+, eωx−,x⊥).(A.11)
Using the above transformations, one can also compute the transformations of field strength
tensor under Lorentz boost. For example, for F+−=∂−A−−∂+A++ig[A+, A−], one
obtains
eF+−=∂−e−ωA−(e−ωx+, eωx−,x⊥)−∂+eωA+(e−ωx+, eωx−,x⊥)
+igh
A+(e−ωx+, eωx−,x⊥), A−(e−ωx+, eωx−,x⊥)i
=˜∂−A−(˜x+,˜x−,x⊥)−˜∂+A+(˜x+,˜x−,x⊥) +ig[A+(˜x+,˜x−,x⊥), A−(˜x+,˜x−,x⊥)]
=F+−(˜x+,˜x−,x⊥)
(A.12)
Similarly, one obtains
eF+−=F+−(˜x+,˜x−,x⊥),
eF+i=eωF+i(˜x+,˜x−,x⊥),
eF−i=e−ωF−i(˜x+,˜x−,x⊥),
eFij=Fij(˜x+,˜x−,x⊥).(A.13)

To characterize gluon radiation, either before or after scattering with the shockwave,
one needs the light-cone wavefunction for gluon splitting. This is textbook knowledge, we
reproduce the result in this appendix for reference. The gluon splitting wave function from
initial state has opposite sign compared to that from final state. We calculate the initial
state gluon splitting.

For the general expression, it is unclear how to get a closed form expression by taking

In obtaining the last equality, we have repeatedly utilized integration by parts to move the
partial derivatives to act on the Dirac delta functions instead of the Wilson lines.
For the two terms at sub-eikonal order, the first term recovers the corresponding non
local terms in the single gluon scattering amplitude in eq. (3.16) when setting the back-
ground field ai= 0, ψB= 0. The second term is a boundary term (boundary in the
longitudinal direction, not the transverse direction) which is proportional to the width of
the shockwave x+
f−x+
i. It is precisely the phase factor from the free propagator given
in Eq. (3.10). If one turns off the background fields a−= 0, These two terms vanish as

For the second term. The time dependence z+∂+J+(0, z−,z) is introduced by the lowest
order expansion of eiH0z+J+
b(0, z−,z)e−iH0z+. In general the time dependence is generated
by the full Hamiltonian eiHz+J+
b(0, z−,z)e−iHz+. In the case when H=H0, it is part
of the sub-eikonal transformation that has already been included in obtaining eq. (C.14).
One should not double count its contribution.

It is apparent that this sub-eikonal interaction involves longitudinal momentum exchange
between the projectile and the shockwave. Transverse coordinates are preserved as well as
the polarization. The polarized Wilson line has the insertion of longitudinal chromoelectric
field f+−=∂−a−. When calculating spin related observables at small x, they are repre-
sented as the interference terms between the eikonal order amplitude and sub-eikonal order
amplitude. The eikonal order amplitudes preserve longitudional momentum conservation
and therefore they will not interfere with sub-eikonal interactions that involve longitudional
momentum exchange with the shockwave.
