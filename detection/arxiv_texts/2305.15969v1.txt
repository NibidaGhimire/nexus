NHAN NGUYEN
Abstract. In this paper, we introduce the notion of local quasi-isomet ry for metric germs
and prove that two deﬁnable germs are quasi-isometric if and only if their tangent cones
are bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic. Since bi-Lipschitz equiva lence is a particular case of local
quasi-isometric equivalence, we obtain Sampaio’s tangent cone theorem as a corollary. As an
application, we reprove the theorem by Fernandes-Sampaio, which states that the tangent
cone of a Lipschitz normally embedded germ is also Lipschitz normally embedded.
1.Introduction
In this work, our focus is on the question of when the tangent c ones of two given deﬁnable
germs are bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic. Several authors have provided partial answers to this
question. For instance, Bernig and Lytchak [1] demonstrate d that if two subanalytic germs
are sub-analytically bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic, then the ir tangent cones are also bi-Lipschitz
homeomorphic. Sampaio [7] showed that Bernig-Lytchak’s re sult still holds if the germs
are bi-Lipschitz equivalent, not necessarily subanalytic . Recently, Koike and Paunescu [5]
extended Sampaio’s result by providing an analogous for arb itrary germs in Rnsatisfying
the sequence selection property (SSP). It is important to no te that SSP is a necessary and
suﬃcient condition for a germ in Rnto have a unique tangent cone (see [8]).
Consider the semialgebraic sets X={(x,y)∈R2|y2=x3,y≥0}andY={(x,y)∈R2|
y2=x5}, withZ=X∪Y(see Figure 1). It can be easily veriﬁed that the bi-Lipschit z types
(even the topological types) of the above sets at the origin a re diﬀerent. However, the tangent
cones coincide and thus are bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic. Thi s suggests that the bi-Lipschitz
invariance of tangent cones should hold under weaker condit ions on the given germs.

In the context of metric spaces, one has the notion of asympto tic tangent cones which are
deﬁned as ultralimits of scaled pointed metric spaces ( X,dX/n,pi). It is well-known that the
bi-Lipschitz types of asymptotic tangent cones are quasi-i sometry invariants of metric spaces.
Quasi-isometry plays a crucial role in geometric group theo ry following the fundamental work
12 NHAN NGUYEN
of Gromov [3]. A map f: (X,dX)→(Y,dY) between two metric spaces is called a quasi-
isometry if there are constants K≥1,A≥0 andC≥0 such that
(i)∀x,x′∈X,1
KdX(x,x′)−A≤dY(f(x),f(x′))≤KdX(x,x′) +A.
(ii)∀y∈Y,∃x∈X:dY(f(x),y)≤C.
IfA=C= 0 thenfis abi-Lipschitz homeomorphism . In particular, when K=
1,A=C= 0 thenfis called an isometry .
Note that quasi-isometry disregards the local geometry. To capture the local behavior,
we propose the concept of local quasi-isometry (or quasi-isometry of metric germs). This
notion is inspired by the deﬁnition of quasi-isometry. Sinc e we work with germs, the constants
AandCin conditions (i) and (ii) are replaced by germs of non-decre asing inﬁnitesimal
functions (see Section 2). We ﬁrst prove that local quasi-is ometry guarantees the invariance
of the bi-Lipschitz type of blow-ups (see Theorem 3.1). Furt hermore, if the given germs are
subsets of Euclidean spaces and have unique tangent cones, t hen the blow-up of Xat a point
pis isometric to the usual tangent cone of Xatp. Consequently, if two such germs are quasi-
isometric, then their tangent cones are bi-Lipschitz equiv alent. We further establish that, in
the o-minimal context, two deﬁnable germs are quasi-isomet ric if and only if their tangent
cones are bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic (see Theorem 6.1). Thi s provides a complete answer to
the question mentioned at the beginning. In particular, we o btain Sampaio’s tangent cone
theorem as a corollary (Theorem 6.3).
As an application, we recover the proof of the main theorem in [2], which states that given
a germ (X,p) inRnwith a unique tangent cone, if ( X,p) is Lipschitz normally embedded,
then its tangent cone is also Lipschitz normally embedded (s ee Theorem 6.6).
The article is organized as follows:
•Section 2: Introduces the concept of local quasi-isometry a nd explores its fundamental
properties.
•Section 3: Discusses the deﬁnition of blow-ups for metric ge rms and establishes the
result that quasi-isometric metric germs yield bi-Lipschi tz homeomorphic blow-ups.
•Sections 4 and 5: Investigate tangent cones at speciﬁc point s and at inﬁnity for subsets
of Euclidean spaces, respectively.
•Section 6: Examines the case of deﬁnable sets in o-minimal st ructures.
Throughout the note, we ﬁx an o-minimal structure on ( R,+,.). By “deﬁnable” we mean
deﬁnable in the structure. Given two non-negative function sf,g:A→R, we writef/lessorsimilargif
there isC > 0 such that f(x)≤Cg(x) for every x∈A, and write f∼giff/lessorsimilargandg/lessorsimilarf.
2.Local quasi-isometries
2.1.Quasi-isometry at a point. A horn function at 0 is the germ at 0 of a non-decreasing
functionϕ:R≥0→R≥0such that
lim
t→0ϕ(t)
t= 0.
Let (X,p,dX) and (Y,q,dY) be two metric germs and let ϕbe a horn function at 0. A map
f: (X,dX,p)→(Y,dY,q) is called a ϕ-quasi-isometric embedding if there are constants
L≥1,L1,L2>0 and a neighborhood UofpinXsuch that for all x,x′inUwe have
(2.1)1
LdX(x,x′)−δ(x,x′,L1,L2)≤dY(f(x),f(x′))≤LdX(x,x′) +δ(x,x′,L1,L2),
whereδ(x,x′,L1,L2) =L1ϕ(L2(dX(x,p) +dX(x′,p))).
We callfaquasi-isometric embedding if it is aϕ-quasi-isometric embedding for some
horn function ϕ.LOCAL QUASI-ISOMETRIES AND TANGENT CONES OF DEFINABLE GERM S 3
The mapfis call aϕ-quasi-isometry if it is aϕ-quasi-isometric embedding and there are
a neighborhood VofqinYand constants constants L′

2>0 such that for every y∈V
there isx∈Usuch that
(2.2) dY(y,f(x))≤L′
1ϕ(L′
2dX(x,p)).
We say that ( X,p) and (Y,q) arequasi-isometric if there is a ϕ-quasi-isometry between
them for some horn function ϕ.
A mapg: (Y,q)→(X,p) is called a ϕ-quasi-inverse of fif the following conditions are
satisﬁed:
(⋆) there are a neighborhood U′ofpinXand constants L3,L4>0 such that for all x∈U′
dX(g◦f(x),x)≤L3ϕ(L4dY(f(x),q))
(⋆⋆) there are a neighborhood V′ofqinYand constants L′
3,L′
4>0 such that for all y∈V′
dY(f◦g(y),y)≤L′
3ϕ(L′
4dX(g(y),p)).
Remark 2.1. (i) A quasi-isometry needs neither to be continuous nor inje ctive.
(ii) 0-quasi-isometry is the germ of a bi-Lipschitz homeomo rphism.
(iii) Letf: (X,p)→(Y,q) be a quasi-isometric embedding. Then,
dX(x,p)∼dY(f(x),q)
Example 2.2. LetX,YandZbe as in Figure 1. Let h: (X,0)→(Y,0) be deﬁned by
h(x,y) = (x,y5/3). It is easy to check that his aϕ-quasi-isometry with ϕ(t) =tbwhere
1< b <3
2, and the map g:Y→Xdeﬁned by g(x,y) = (x,|y|3/5) is aϕ-quasi-inverse of
h. Therefore, ( X,0) and (Y,0) are quasi-isometric. Similarly, one can show that ( X,0) and
(Z,0) are quasi-isometric as well.
Lemma 2.3. (i) Everyϕ-quasi-isometry has a ϕ-quasi-inverse.
(ii) Every quasi-inverse of a ϕ-quasi-isometry is also a ϕ-quasi-isometry.
(iii) Composition of ϕ-quasi-isometries is again a ϕ-quasi-isometry.
Proof. Letf: (X,p)→(Y,q) be aϕ-quasi-isometry with some horn function (at 0) ϕ.
(i) Letg: (Y,q)→(X,p) be a map deﬁned as follows. Let y∈Y. Ify∈f(X), we take a
pointx∈f−1(y) and setg(y) =x. Ify/\e}atio\slash∈f(X), by (2.2), there is x∈Xsuch that
(2.3) dY(y,f(x))≤L′
1ϕ(L′
2dX(x,p))
whereL′
1andL′
2are positive constants independent of x. We then put g(y) =x. We will
show thatgis aϕ-quasi-inverse of f.
Letx∈Xnearp. Ifx∈g◦f(X), thenx=g◦f(x), so the condition ( ⋆) is obvious. Assume
thatx/\e}atio\slash∈g◦f(X). Setx′=g◦f(x) andy=f(x). Note that x′/\e}atio\slash=xandf(x) =f(x′) =y.
It follows from (2.1)

≤L1ϕ/parenleftbig
L2/parenleftbig
dX(x,p) +dX(x′,p)/parenrightbig/parenrightbig
for some constant L,L1,L2independent of ( x,x′). By (iii) of Remark 2.1, we can choose L3>
0 (independent of ( x,x′)) such that L2(dX(x,p) +dX(x′,p))≤L3(dY(f(x),q) +dY(f(x′),q)).
Sincef(x) =f(x′) andϕis non-decreasing,
dX(x,x′)≤LL1ϕ(2L3dY(f(x),q)).
Thus, the condition ( ⋆) is satisﬁed.4 NHAN NGUYEN
We now check the condition ( ⋆⋆). Lety∈Ynearq. Ify∈f(X), by the construction,
f◦g(y) =y, hence (⋆⋆) is obvious. Assume that y/\e}atio\slash∈f(X). Letx=g(y). It follows from
(2.3),
dY(y,f◦g(y)) =dY(y,f(x))≤L′
1ϕ(L′
2dX(x,p)) =L′
1ϕ(L′
2dX(g(y),p)).
This yields ( ⋆⋆). Therefore, gis aϕ-quasi-inverse of f.
(ii) Suppose g: (Y,q)→(X,p) is anϕ-quasi-inverse of f. We will show that gis a
ϕ-quasi-isometry. We need to show that gsatisﬁes (2.1) and (2.2).
Lety,y′be points in Ynearq. Sincefis aϕ-quasi-isometry, by (2.1),
dX(g(y),g(y′))≤LdY(f◦g(y),f◦g(y′)) +δ(g(y),g(y′),L1,L2).
Moreover,
dY(f◦g(y),f◦g(y′))≤dY(y,y′) +dY(f◦g(y),y) +dY(f◦g(y′),y′)
≤dY(y,y′) +Cϕ(C′dY(g(y),p)) +Cϕ(C′dY(g(y′),p)) (by (⋆⋆))
≤dY(y,y′) +Cϕ/parenleftbig
C′/bracketleftbig
dY(g(y),p) +dY(g(y′),p)/bracketrightbig/parenrightbig
(sinceϕis non-decreasing)
HereC,C′are positive constants independent of ( y,y′). Recall that
δ(g(y),g(y′),L1,L2) =L1ϕ/parenleftbig
L2/bracketleftbig
dY(g(y),p) +dY(g(y′),p)/bracketrightbig/parenrightbig
.
Hence,
dX(g(y),g(y′))≤LdY(y,y′) +C1ϕ/parenleftbigC′
1/bracketleftbigdY(g(y),p) +dY(g(y′),p)/bracketrightbig/parenrightbig
whereC1=C+L1andC′
1=C′+L2. This shows that gsatisﬁes the right-hand-side inequality
in (2.1). By similar arguments, it is easy to check the left-h and-side inequality.
Now letz∈Xnearp. Takey=f(z). Sincegis quasi-inverse of f, by (⋆), there are
constantC,C′>0 (independent of y) such that
dX(z,g(y)) =dX(z,g◦f(z))≤Cϕ(C′dY(f(z),q)) =Cϕ(C′dY(y,q)).
Thus, (2.2) is satisﬁed.
(iii) Suppose that h: (Y,q)→(Z,a) is aϕ-quasi-isometry. We need to show that the map
h◦f: (X,p)→(Z,a) satisﬁes (2.1) and (2.2). We prove the right-hand-side ine quality in
(2.1), the left-hand-side one can be done similarly. Indeed , letx,x′∈Xnearp. Sincefis a
ϕ-quasi-isometric embedding,
dX(x,x′)≤LdY(f(x),f(x′) +δ(x,x′,L1,L2)
whereL≥1,L1,L2>0 are constants independent of ( x,x′). In addition, since his a
ϕ-quasi-isometric embedding, there are C≥1,C1,C2>0 such that
dY(f(x),f(x′)≤CdZ(h◦f(x),h◦f(x′)) +δ(f(x),f(x′),C1,C2).
This yields that
dX(x,x′)≤LCdZ(h◦f(x),h◦f(x′)) +δ(x,x′,L1,L2) +Lδ(f(x),f(x′),C1,C2).
By (iii) in Remark 2.1, we can ﬁnd K > 0 big enough such that
KL2(dX(x,p) +dX(x′,p))≥C2(dY(f(x),q) +dY(f(x′),q)).
We may assume that KL1>LC1. This implies that
δ(x,x′,KL1,KL2)≥Lδ(f(x),f(x′),C1,C2)
(sinceϕis non-decreasing). Hence,
dX(x,x′)≤LCdZ(h◦f(x),h◦f(x′)) +δ(x,x′,2KL1,KL2),
so (2.1) is satisﬁed.LOCAL QUASI-ISOMETRIES AND TANGENT CONES OF DEFINABLE GERM S 5
It remains to check (2.2). Given z∈Zneara, applying (2.2) to h, there isy∈Ysuch that
dZ(z,h(y))≤Cϕ(C′dY(y,q))
whereC,C′>0 are constant independent of z. Letgbe aϕ-quasi-inverse of fand take
x=g(y). By (ii) in Remark 2.1, we can choose K > 0 depending only on gsuch that
C′dY(y,q)≤KdX(x,p). Sinceϕis non-decreasing,
dZ(z,h(y))≤Cϕ(KdX(x,p)).
Thus,h◦fsatisﬁes (2.2). The proof is completed. /square
3.Blow-ups
3.1.Ultraﬁlters. LetIbe an inﬁnite set. A ﬁlter onIis a non-empty family ωof subsets
ofIsuch that
(1)∅ /\e}atio\slash∈ω,
(2) IfA∈ω,A⊂BthenB∈ω,
(3) IfA1,...,Anare inωthenA1∩...∩An∈ω.
An element of ωis calledω-large . We say that a property ( P) holds for ω-large if (P) is
satisﬁed for all in some ω-large set. A ﬁlter is called principal if it contains a ﬁnite set.
Anultraﬁlter is a ﬁlterωsatisfying further property that for any A∈IeitherAorI\A
is inω. It is known that every ﬁlter contains an ultraﬁlter. In this paper, we only consider
non-principal ultraﬁlters , i.e., ultraﬁlters that contain no ﬁnite sets.
3.2.Ultralimits. Letωbe a non-principal ultraﬁlter on Iand letYbe a metric space. A
ω-limit of a function f:I→Y, denoted by lim ωf= limωf(i)∈Y, is deﬁned to be a point
y∈Yif for every neighborhood UofyinY,f−1(U) isω-large.
An important basic fact is that if the ω-limit exists then it is unique. In particular, if Y
is compact the ω-limit is well-deﬁned, meaning it uniquely exists. Consequ ently, iff(i) is a
bounded sequence in Rn, then lim ωf(i) is uniquely determined.
To see this, let y1andy2be two diﬀerent ω-limits off. SinceYis a Hausdorﬀ, there are
neighbourhoods U1ofy1andU2ofy2inYsuch thatf−1(U1)∩f−1(U2) =∅. By deﬁnition,
f−1(U1) andf−1(U2) both are in ω, so is their intersection (see Property (3)). In other
words,∅ ∈ω, which contradicts Property (1). Now suppose that Yis compact. Assume
on the contrary that the ω-limit offdoes not exist, i.e., for any point y∈Ythere is a
neighbourhood Uysuch thatf−1(Uy)/\e}atio\slash∈ω. By the compactness, Ycan be covered by ﬁnitely
many such neighborhoods, let’s say Uy1,...,Uyk. By deﬁnition, I\f−1(Uyi)∈ωfor every
i= 1,...,k . This implies that
/intersectiondisplay
i(I\f−1(Uyi)) =I\/uniondisplay
if−1(Uyi)∈ω,
which is a contradiction since I\/uniontext
if−1(Uyi) =∅.
3.3.Ultralimit of pointed metric spaces. Letωbe a non-principal ultraﬁlter on N. Let
(Xi,di,pi)i∈Nbe a sequence of pointed metric spaces. Let Seqdenote the space of all sequences
(xi) of points xi∈Xisuch that sup {di(xi,pi)}<∞. Given two sequences x= (xi) and
x′= (x′
i) inSeq, we deﬁne dω(x,x′) = limωdi(xi,x′
i). The ultralimit lim ω(Xi,di,pi) is the
metric space
(Xω,dω) = (Seq,dω)/∼
wherex∼x′ifdω(x,x′) = 0. We denote by [( xi)] the equivalence class of ( xi).6 NHAN NGUYEN
3.4.Blow-ups. Let (X,d) be a metric space and let p∈X. Let Λ = ( λi)i∈Nbe a sequence
of positive real numbers tending to inﬁnity. The blow-up of Xatpwith the scale Λ is the
metric space
(Xω,Λ,p,dω) = lim
ω(X,di,p)
wheredi=λid.
If (X,d) is a unbounded metric space then we can deﬁne the blow-up of Xat inﬁnity
to be the metric space
(Xω,Λ,∞,dω) = lim
ω(X,d′
i,p)
whered′
i=d/λi.
Theorem 3.1. Let(X,p,dX)and(Y,q,dY)be two pointed metric spaces. If they are quasi-
isometric then their blow-ups Xω,Λ,pandYω,Λ,qare bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic.
Proof. Letf: (X,p)→(Y,q) be aϕ-quasi-isometry where ϕis a horn function at 0. Consider
the mapfω,Λ: (Xω,Λ,p,dX,ω)→(Yω,Λ,q,dY,ω) deﬁned by f([(xi)]) = [(f(xi))]. We will show
thatfω,Λis a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism.
Indeed, let x= [(xi)] andx′= [(x′
i)] be inXω,Λ,p, by deﬁnition,
dY,ω(fω,Λ(x),fω,Λ(y)) = lim
ωλidY(f(xi),f(x′
i)).
It follows from (2.1) that there are constants L≥1,L1,L2>0 independent of ( x,x′) such
that

LdX(xi,x′

i,L1,L2)≤dY(f(xi),f(x′

Hence,

i,L1,L2)≤λidY(f(xi),f(x′
i))≤LλidX(xi,x′

Observe that
λiδ(xi,x′
i,L1,L2) =λiL1ϕ(L2[dX(xi,p) +dX(x′
i,p)])
=L1L2λi[dX(xi,p) +dX(x′
i,p)]ϕ(L2[dX(xi,p) +dX(x′
i,p)])
L2[dX(xi,p) +dX(x′
i,p)]→0 asi→ ∞
(sinceλi(dX(xi,p) +dX(x′
i,p)) is bounded and ϕ(x)/x→0 asx→0). Passing the ultralimit,
we get
1
LdX,ω(x,x′)≤dY,ω(fω,Λ(x),fω,Λ(x′))≤LdX,ω(x,x′).
This shows that fω,Λis a bi-Lipschitz embedding.
To provefω,Λis a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism, it suﬃces to show that fω,Λis surjective.
Lety= [(yi)]∈Yω,Λ,q. By (2.2), there is a sequence ( xi)⊂Xsuch that
(3.1) dY(yi,f(xi))≤Cϕ(C′dX(xi,p)).
for some constants C,C′>0 independent of ( xi).
It follows that
(3.2)dY(yi,f(xi))
dX(xi,p)≤Cϕ(C′dX(xi,p))
dX(xi,p)→0 asi→ ∞.
SincedY(yi,q)≥dY(f(xi),q)−dY(f(xi),yi), by (3.2) and the fact that dY(f(xi),q)∼
dX(xi,p),
dY(yi,q)∼dY(f(xi),q)∼dX(xi,p).LOCAL QUASI-ISOMETRIES AND TANGENT CONES OF DEFINABLE GERM S 7
Moreover,λidY(yi,q) is bounded, so is λidX(xi,p), and hence ( xi)∈Seqω,Λ(X,p).
It follows again from (3.1) that
λidY(yi,f(xi))≤CC′λidX(xi,p)ϕ(C′dX(xi,p))
C′dX(xi,p)→0 asi→ ∞
whereC,C′are positive constants. This implies that dY,ω(y,fω,Λ(x)) = 0. In other words,
y=fω,Λ(x)) where x= [(xi)]. Thus,fω,Λis surjective. /square
4.Tangent cones at a point p
LetXbe a subset of Rnand letp∈X. Fix a sequence Λ = ( λi) such that lim i→∞λi=∞.
The Λ-tangent cone ofXatpis the set
C(X,Λ,p) ={v∈Rn:∃(xi)∈X,xi→p,lim
i→∞λi(xi−p) =v}.
When the set C(X,p, Λ) is independent of the choice of Λ then we say that Xhasa unique
tangent cone atp.
Set
C(X,p) ={v∈Rn,∃(xi)⊂X,xi→p,∃(λi)⊂R+,λi→ ∞,v= lim
i→∞λi(xi−p)}
Then, ifXhas a unique tangent cone at pthen
C(X,Λ,p) =C(X,p)
for all sequences Λ tending to ∞.
Now let us assume that Xhas a unique tangent cone at p. Fix a sequence Λ = ( λi) as
above and ﬁx a principal ultraﬁlter ωonN.
Consider the following natural map:
Φ : (Xω,Λ,p,dout,ω)→(C(X,p),dout),Φ([(xi)]) = lim
ωλi(xi−p)
wheredoutis the metric induced by the Euclidean distance.
Since (λi(xi−p))i∈Nis a bounded sequence in Rn, theω-limit is uniquely determined.
Moreover, given v= limωλi(xi−p), there is subsequence ( λik(xik−p)) such that vis the
limit of the sequence ( λik(xik−p)) in the standard sense. This implies that v∈C(X,p) and
hence Φ is well deﬁned.
Proposition 4.1. Φis an isometry.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that Φ is a surjective isometric embedding. Without loss of gener-
ality, we may assume that pcoincides with the origin 0. Let x= [(xi)] andy= [(yi)] be in
Xω,Λ,p. We have
dout,ω(x,y) = lim
ωλi/bardblxi−yi/bardbl=/bardbllim
ωλixi−lim
ωλiyi/bardbl=/bardblΦ(x)−Φ(y)/bardbl.
This implies that Φ is an isometric embedding.
Let us now prove the surjectivity. Let v∈C(X,p). By the uniqueness of the tangent cone,
we have
C(X,p) =C(X,Λ,p)
It follows that there is a sequence ( xi) onXsuch that lim i→∞λixi=v. Putx= [(xi)]. It is
obvious that x∈Xω,Λ,pand Φ(x) =v. Hence, Φ is surjective. /square
A direct consequence of Proposition 4.1 and Theorem 3.1 is as follow:8 NHAN NGUYEN
Theorem 4.2. Let(X,p)and(Y,q)be germs in RnandRmrespectively. Assume that (X,p)
and(Y,q)have unique tangent cones. If (X,p)and(Y,q)are quasi-isometric then C(X,p)
andC(Y,q)are bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic.
5.Quasi-isometries and tangent cones at infinity
5.1.Quasi-isometry at inﬁnity. A horn function at inﬁnity is the germ at inﬁnity of
a non-decreasing function ψ:R≥0→R≥0satisfying
lim
t→∞ψ(t)
t= 0.
Let (X,dX) and (Y,dY) be two unbounded metric spaces, and let ψbe a horn function at
inﬁnity. A map f:X→Yis called aψ-quasi-isometric embedding at inﬁnity if there
are a point p∈Xand constants L≥1,L1,L2,r > 0 such that for all x,x′inX\Br(X,p)
we have
(5.1)1
LdX(x,x′)−σ(x,x′,L1,L2)≤dY(f(x),f(x′))≤LdX(x,x′) +σ(x,x′,L1,L2),
whereσ(x,x′,L1,L2) =L1ψ(L2(dX(x,p) +dX(x′,p))) andBr(X,p) is the ball in Xcentered
atpof radiusr.
We callfaquasi-isometric embedding at inﬁnity if it is aψ-quasi-isometric embedding
at inﬁnity for some horn function at inﬁnity ψ.
The mapfis call aψ-quasi-isometry at inﬁnity if it is aψ-quasi-isometric embedding
at inﬁnity and there are constants L′

2,r′>0 such that for every y∈Y\Br′(Y,f(p)) there
isx∈Xsuch that
(5.2) dY(y,f(x))≤L′
1ψ(L′
2dX(x,p)).
We say that XandYarequasi-isometric at inﬁnity (or (X,∞) and (Y,∞) are quasi-
isometric) if there is a ψ-quasi-isometry between them for some horn function (at inﬁ nity)
ψ.
Givenpas above, we set q=f(p). A mapg:Y→Xis calledψ-quasi-inverse of fif
the following conditions are satisﬁed:

Here by a neighborhood at ∞of a metric space X(res.Y) we mean the set X\BR(X,p)
(resp.X\BR′(Y,q)) whereRandR′are big enough real positive numbers.
Remark 5.1. The deﬁnition of quasi-isometry at inﬁnity is independent o f the choice of p
that is if the map fis a quasi-isometry, then for every p∈X, the inequalities (5.1) and (5.2)
hold (the constants L,L1,L2,L′
1,L′
2may vary depending on the chosen p).
By employing a similar reasoning as in the proof of Lemma 2.3, we obtain
Lemma 5.2. (i) Everyψ-quasi-isometry at inﬁnity has a ψ-quasi-inverse.
(ii) Every quasi-inverse of a ψ-quasi-isometry at inﬁnity is also a ψ-quasi-isometry at
inﬁnity.
(iii) Composition of ψ-quasi-isometries at inﬁnity is again a ψ-quasi-isometry at inﬁnity.LOCAL QUASI-ISOMETRIES AND TANGENT CONES OF DEFINABLE GERM S 9
Theorem 5.3. Let(X,dX)and(Y,dY)be two unbounded metric spaces. Then, if (X,∞)and
(Y,∞)are quasi-isometric then their blow-ups at inﬁnity (Xω,Λ,∞,dX,ω)and(Yω,Λ,∞,dY,ω)are
bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic.
Proof. Letf: (X,∞)→(Y,∞) be aψ-quasi-isometry where ψis a horn function at inﬁnity.
Consider the map
fω,Λ:Xω,Λ,∞→Yω,Λ,∞
deﬁned by [( xi)]/mapsto→[(f(xi))]. By the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, it is
easy to check that fω,Λis a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism. /square
5.2.Tangent cones at inﬁnity. LetXbe an unbounded subset of Rn. Let Λ = ( λi)⊂R
be a sequence such that lim i→∞λi=∞.Similar to the deﬁnition of tangent cones at a point,
the Λ-tangent cone of Xat inﬁnity is the set
C(X,Λ,∞) ={v∈Rn:∃(xi)∈X,xi→ ∞,lim
i→∞xi
λi=v}.
As the setC(X,Λ,∞) is independent of the choice of Λ then we say that Xhasa unique
tangent cone at inﬁnity .
Set
C(X,∞) ={v∈Rn,∃(xi)⊂X,xi→p,∃(λi)⊂R+,λi→ ∞,v= lim
i→∞xi
λi}.
Then, ifXis of a unique tangent cone at inﬁnity then
C(X,Λ,∞) =C(X,∞)
for every sequence Λ tending to ∞.
Proposition 5.4. LetXbe an unbounded subset of Rn. Consider Xas a metric space with
the outer metric. If Xis of a unique tangent cone at inﬁnity, then the map
Ψ : (Xω,Λ,∞,dout,ω)→(C(X,∞),dout),[(xi)]/mapsto→lim
ωxi
λi
is an isometry.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Proposition 4.1. /square
Consequently, we get
Corollary 5.5. LetX⊂RnandY⊂Rmbe unbounded sets of unique tangent cones at
inﬁnity. If (X,∞)and(Y,∞)are quasi-isometric then C(X,∞)andC(Y,∞)are bi-Lipschitz
homeomorphic.
6.Applications
6.1.Tangent cones of deﬁnable germs. In this section, we examine germs of sets deﬁnable
in an o-minimal structure. It is known as a consequence of Cur ve Selection that such germs
possess unique tangent cones. Our aim is to prove the followi ng result:
Theorem 6.1. Let(X,p)⊂Rnand(Y,q)⊂Rmbe two deﬁnable germs. Then, (X,p)and
(Y,q)are quasi-isometric if and only if their tangent cones are bi -Lipschitz homeomorphism.
We need some preparation before giving the proof.
GivenA⊂Rnand a non-negative function ϕ:R≥0→R≥0, we deﬁne
Nϕ(A) ={x∈Rn: dist(x,A)≤ϕ(/bardblx/bardbl)}.10 NHAN NGUYEN
Lemma 6.2. LetXbe a deﬁnable set in Rnand 0∈X. Then, the germs (X,0)and
(C(X,0),0)are quasi-isometric.
Proof. It follows from [4, Proposition 4.15] there is a deﬁnable ger mθ: (R,0)→(R,0) which
is odd, strictly increasing such that
(X,0)⊂ Nϕ(C(X,0))
whereϕ(t) =tθ(t). It is clear that ϕis a horn function at 0.
Consider the set Z={(x,y)∈X×C(X,0) :y= dist(x,C(X,0)}. SinceC(X,0) is a closed
set,Zx={y∈Z: (x,y)∈Z}is nonempty for every x∈X. By Deﬁnable Choice (see [9], Ch
6, (1.2)), there is a deﬁnable map f:X→C(X,0) such that the graph of fis contained in
Z.
We will show that fis the desired isometry. It suﬃces to check that fsatisﬁes the conditions
(2.1) and (2.2).
First note that
/bardblf(x)−x/bardbl ≤ϕ(/bardblx/bardbl)
for everyxnear the origin. Given x,ynear 0, we have
/bardblf(x)−f(y)/bardbl ≤ /bardblx−y/bardbl+/bardblf(x)−x/bardbl+/bardblf(y)−y/bardbl
≤ /bardblx−y/bardbl+ϕ(/bardblx/bardbl) +ϕ(/bardbly/bardbl)
≤ /bardblx−y/bardbl+ϕ(/bardblx/bardbl+/bardbly/bardbl) (sinceϕis increasing) .
Similarly,
/bardblx−y/bardbl ≤ /bardblf(x)−f(y)/bardbl+/bardblf(x)−x/bardbl+/bardblf(y)−y/bardbl
≤ /bardblf(x)−f(y)/bardbl+ϕ(/bardblx/bardbl) +ϕ(/bardbly/bardbl)
≤ /bardblf(x)−f(y)/bardbl+ϕ(/bardblx/bardbl+/bardbly/bardbl) (sinceϕis increasing) .
The inequality (2.1) is then satisﬁed.
Now giveny∈(C(X,0),0), sinceX⊂ Nϕ(C(X,0)), there is x∈(X,0) such that /bardblx−y/bardbl ≤
ϕ(/bardblx/bardbl). Then,
/bardbly−f(x)/bardbl ≤ /bardbly−x/bardbl+/bardblx−f(x)/bardbl ≤2ϕ(/bardblx/bardbl).
Thus, the condition (2.2) is satisﬁed and the proof is comple te. /square
Now we are in a position to prove Theorem 6.1.
Proof of Theorem 6.1 . The necessity follows from Theorem 4.2. It remains to check
the suﬃciency. Without loss of generality, we may assume tha tpandqcoincide with the
origin 0. From the assumption, ( C(X,0),0) and (C(Y,0),0) are quasi-isometric. By Lemma
6.2 we know that ( X,0) and (C(X,0),0) (resp. (Y,0) and (C(Y,0),0)) are quasi-isometric.
Therefore, ( X,0) and (Y,0) must be quasi-isometric (see Lemma 2.3, property (iii)). /square
A direct consequence of Theorem 6.1 is as follows:
Theorem 6.3 ([7], Theorem 2.2) .LetXandYbe two deﬁnable sets and let p∈Xand
q∈Y. If(X,p)and(Y,q)are bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic, then C(X,p)andC(Y,q)are also
bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic.
A version at inﬁnity of Theorem 6.1 is as follows.
Theorem 6.4. LetX⊂RnandY⊂Rmbe two unbounded deﬁnable sets. If (X,∞)and
(Y,∞)are quasi-isometric then C(X,∞)andC(Y,∞)are bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic.LOCAL QUASI-ISOMETRIES AND TANGENT CONES OF DEFINABLE GERM S 11
Proof. The proof follows the same arguments presented in the proof o f Theorem 6.1, using
Lemma 6.5 and Lemma 5.2 instead of Lemma 2.3 and Proposition 4 .15 in [4].
Lemma 6.5. LetX⊂Rnbe an unbounded deﬁnable set. Then, there is a continuous horn
function (at inﬁnity) ψ:R≥0→R≥0such that
(X,∞)⊂ Nψ(C(X,∞)).
Proof. Forx∈Xwe seth(x) =dist(x,C(X,∞))
/bardblx/bardbl.
Claim:h(x)→0 whenxtends to ∞.
If the claim fails, by Curve Selection, there are a constant c>0 and a continuous deﬁnable
curveγ: (a,+∞)→X,a > 0, limt→∞(γ(t)) =∞such thath(γ(t))> c for allt. By
Monotonicity ([9] Ch 3 (1.2)), lim t→∞γ(t)
/bardblγ(t)/bardbl=v∈C(X,∞). This yields that u(t) =/bardblγ(t)/bardblv
is also inC(X,∞). Then,
h(γ(t)) =dist(γ(t),C(X,∞))
/bardblγ(t)/bardbl≤dist(γ(t),u(t))
/bardblγ(t)/bardbl→0
which is a contradiction. Therefore, the claim is true.
Now consider the diﬀeomorphism:
σ:Rn\{0} →Rn\{0},σ(x) =x
/bardblx/bardbl2.
SetZ=σ(X\{0}) andg:Z→R,g=h◦σ−1. Since lim z→0g(z) = 0, it is possible to extend g
to a continuous function ˜ gdeﬁned onZand ˜g(0) = 0. Fix an r>0. By /suppress Lojasiewicz inequality
(see [6, 10]), there is an odd, strictly increasing continuo us deﬁnable function θ:R→R,
θ(0) = 0 such that θ(˜g(z))≤ /bardblz/bardblfor allz∈Z∩Bn
r. Then, ˜g(z)≤θ−1(/bardblz/bardbl).
Letψ1:R≥0→Rbe a function deﬁned by ψ1(t) =θ(1/t). Note that lim t→∞ψ1(t) = 0.
Givenx∈X\Bn
1/r, by setting z=σ(x) we have
h(x) = ˜g(z)≤θ−1(/bardblz/bardbl) =ψ1(/bardblx/bardbl) (since /bardblz/bardbl= 1//bardblx/bardbl).
This implies on X∩Bn
1/r, dist(x,C(X,∞))≤ψ1(/bardblx/bardbl)/bardblx/bardbl.Putψ2(t) =tψ1(t). ThenX∩Bn
1/r
is contained in Nψ2(C(X,∞)). It suﬃces to show that there is a horn function at inﬁnity
ψ≥ψ2whentsuﬃciently large. Indeed if ψ2(t)≤ln(t) astbig enough, we take ψ(t) = ln(t)
which is obviously a horn function at inﬁnity. Otherwise, we chooseψ=ψ2. Note that
ln(t)≤ψ2(t)≤twhentis big enough. Since ln( t) andtare increasing functions, so is ψ2as
tis big enough. This implies that ψ=ψ2is a horn function at inﬁnity. This completes the
proof. /square

6.2.Tangent cones of a Lipschitz normally embedded germ. LetXbe a path-connected
subset of Rn. Consider following two metrics naturally equipped on X:the outer metric ( dout)
induced by the Euclidean distance of the ambient space Rnandthe inner metric ( dinn)where
the distance between two points in Xis deﬁned as the inﬁmum of the lengths of rectiﬁable
curve inXconnecting these points. Xis called Lipschitz normally embedded (orLNE for
brevity) if these two metrics are equivalent, i.e., there is a constantC≥1 such that
∀x,y∈X,dinn(x,y)≤Cdout(x,y).
The inﬁmum of such constants Cis referred to as the LNE constant ofX.
It is obvious that Xis LNE if and only if the identity map
id: (X,dinn)→(X,dout)12 NHAN NGUYEN
is a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism.
We say that XisLNE at a point x0∈X(orthe germ (X,x0)is LNE ) if there is a
neighborhood Uofx0inRnsuch thatX∩Uis LNE.
Theorem 6.6 ( [2], Theorem 2.6) .Let X be a path-connected subset of Rmand letx0∈X.
Suppose that X has a unique tangent cone at x0. IfXis Lipschitz normally embedded, so is
C(X,x0).
Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that x0coincides with the origin 0. Consider
the identity map id: (X,0,dinn)→(X,0,dout). Since (X,0) is LNE so the map idis a bi-
Lipschitz homeomorphism. Fix a non-principal ultraﬁlter ωonNand a sequence of positive
numbers Λ = ( λi)i∈Nsuch that lim i→∞λi=∞.
By Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 6.4, we have the following diagram
(Xω,Λ,0,dinn,ω) (Xω,Λ,0,dout,ω)
(C(X,0),dout)idω,Λ
Φ
whereidω,Λis a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism and Φ is a isometry. Set Ψ := Φ ◦idω,Λ. Then
ψis a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism. Let x,ybe two points in C(X,0). By deﬁnition, there
are sequences ( xi) and (yi) inXtending to 0 such that lim i→∞λiyi=xand limi→∞λiyi=y.
For eachi, letγi: [0,1]→Xbe a shortest arc in Xconnecting xiandyi. Reparametrizing
γi, we may assume that length( γi([0,t])) =t.length(γi).
It is obvious from deﬁnition that Ψ([( xi)]) =xand Ψ([(yi)]) =y. Moreover,
lim
i→∞λi/bardblxi−yi/bardbl=/bardblx−y/bardbl.
Thus, there is N∈Nbig enough such that for every i≥N,
λi/bardblxi−yi/bardbl ≤2/bardblx−y/bardbl.
SinceXis LNE,
(6.1) λilength(γi)≤2C/bardblx−y/bardbl,
whereCis the LNE constant of ( X,0).
Consider the following map
γ: [0,1]→(Xω,Λ,0,dinn,ω)t/mapsto→[(γi(t))].
Fort,t′∈[0,1],t>t′, we have
(6.2)dinn,ω([(γi(t))],[(γi(t′))]) = lim
ω(λidinn(γi(t),γi(t′))≤lim
ωλi(t−t′)length(γi)
Combining with (6.1), we get
dinn,ω([(γi(t))],[(γi(t′))])≤2C(t−t′)/bardblx−y/bardbl
This implies that
(i)γis a continuous map, hence it is a curve in ( Xω,Λ,0,dinn,ω) connecting [( xi)] and
[(yi)].
(ii) length( γ)≤2C/bardblx−y/bardbl.LOCAL QUASI-ISOMETRIES AND TANGENT CONES OF DEFINABLE GERM S 13
Now, let ˜γbe the image of γby the map Ψ. Then, ˜ γis a curve in Xconnecting xandy.
Moreover,
dinn(x,y)≤length(˜γ)≤Klength(γ)(ii)
≤2KC/bardblx−y/bardbl
whereKis the bi-Lipschitz constant of Ψ. This ends the proof.
