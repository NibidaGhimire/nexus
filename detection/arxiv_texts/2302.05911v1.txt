Abstract: With the well -established correlation between the relative stabilities of isomers 
and their interstellar abundances coupled with the prevalence of isomeric species among the 
interstellar molecular species, isomerization remains a plausible formation route for isomers 
in the interstellar medium.   The present work reports an extensive investigation of the 
isomerization energies o f 246 molecular species from 65 isomeric groups  using the Gaussian -
4 theory composite method with atoms ranging from 3 to 12.  From the results, the high 
abundances of the most stable isomers coupled with the energy sources in interstellar medium 
drive the isomerization process even for barriers as high as 67.4 kcal/mol.  Specifically, the 
cyanides and their 
corresponding isocyanides 
pairs appear to be effectively 
synthesized via this 
process.  The following 
potential interstellar molecules;  CNC, NCCN, c -C5H, methylene ketene, methyl Ketene, 
CH3SCH3,  C5O,  1,1-ethanediol, propanoic acid, propan -2-ol, and propanol are identified and 
discussed.   The study further reaffirms the importance of thermodynamics in interstellar 
formation processes on a larger scale and a ccounts for the known isomeric species. In all the 
isomeric groups, isomerization appears to be an effective route for the formation of the less 
stable isomers (which are probably less abundant) from the most stable ones that are perhaps 
more abundant.

Introduction : That the interstellar medium (ISM) is chemically rich is not an argument with 
the discoveries of over 200 different molecular species in this thin space between the stars 
which was earlier regarded as a vacuum dotted with stars, black holes, and other cele stial 
bodies [1-6]. These  molecules are important in various fields  such as atmospheric chemistry, 
astrochemistry, prebiotic chemistry, astrophysics, astronomy, astrobiology, etc, and in our 
understanding of the solar system, ''the world around us'' with e ach successfully detected 
interstellar molecule telling the story of the chemistry and physics of the environment from 
where it was detected. They serve as the most important tools for probing deep into the 
interior of the molecular clouds and the molecula r clouds are significant because it is from 
them that stars and  consequently new planets are formed. The symmetric rotors serve as 
interstellar thermometers while the metal -bearing species provide useful information 
regarding the depletion of these molecul ar species into the molecular dust grains. 
Understanding how the simple molecules that were present on the early earth may have given 
rise to the complex systems and processes of contemporary biology is one question the 
2 
 biologically related interstellar mo lecules can be used to address. Molecules also provide the 
cooling mechanism for the clouds through their emission [3,7-8]. 
A careful look at the list of known interstellar and circumstellar molecules reveals some 
interesting chemistries among these molecu lar species. Tables 1 and 2 contain the list of the 
currently (as of June 2021) known interstellar and circumstellar species arranged according to 
the number of atoms making up the molecules.

Some of the chemistries existing among the interstellar molecular species include  the 
dominance of the linear carbon ch ain species of the form  Cn, H 2Cn, HC nN, CH 3(CC) nH, 
CH 3(C≡C)nCN and C nX  (X=N, O, Si, S, H, P, N-, H-) which account for more than 20% of 
all the known interstellar and circumstellar molecular species ; the presence of about 30 alkyl 
group containing interstellar molecules mostly observed from the same or similar molecular 
clouds;  periodic trends in which elements from the same group appear to form similar 4 
 compounds with similar properties as in the ca se of oxygen and sulphur (group 6/16 
elements) in which of the over 25  S-containi ng molecules observed in ISM, about 20  have the 
corresponding O -containing molecules uniquely detected in ISM and the abundance of S -
compound relative to its O -analogue is app roximately equal to the cosmic S/O ratio, 1/42 as 
seen in methyl mercaptan, thioisocyanic acid, etc, except where the effect of interstellar 
hydrogen bonding dominates  [9-10]; successive hydrogen addition where large r species are 
believed to be formed from  the smaller unsaturated species via successive hydrogen addition 
in which both species could be shown to be chemically and spatially related  [11]. Isomerism 
is yet another prevailing chemistry among the interstellar molecular species. Apart from the 
diatomics and a few species which cannot form isomers, about 40% of all the known 
interstellar molecules have isomeric analogues ranging from the isomeric pairs to the 
isomeric triads which are believed to have a common precursor for their formation proces s 
[12]. Table 3 lists some of the known isomeric species and their isomeric groups.

Because of the conditions (low temperature and pressure) in the interstellar medium, there is 
hardly a consensus as to how these molecules are formed but some of the chemistries listed 
above and the effect of thermodynamics serve as clue s as to how these molecules could be 
formed in ISM. Focusing here on isomerization, the prevalence of isomeric species among 
the known astromolecules coupled with the energy sources in ISM such as the shock waves 
(which could arise from the interaction of t he Earth's magnetic field with the solar wind, 5 
 molecular outflows during star formation, supernova blasts and galaxies colliding with each 
other ) which provide energy  for both the formation and distributio n of large interstellar 
species, place isomerizatio n as one of the most plausible routes for the formation of 
interstellar molecules  [13]. As observed in some studies, the most stable isomers are found to 
be more abundant tha n their less stable analogues except where other factors dominate; thus, 
the isome rization of the most stable isomer (which is probably the most abundant) to the less 
stable isomers can be a very effective and efficient formation mechanism in ISM. Also, ap art 
from the energy sources in ISM, the high abundance  of the most stable isomer can drive the 
isomerization process irrespective of the energy barrier.  
According to the minimum energy principle  [14], isomerization is the most important process 
in determining the relative abundances of the isomers in ISM. Is omers of the same generic 
formula are said to have a common intermediate in their formation and destruction routes. 
After reaching the generic formula, the equilibration process is said to occur. This implies an 
internal isomerization with a low activation  barrier, assisted isomerization , or catalytic 
isomerization at the grain/ice surface  [14].   
The present work aims at estimating accurate isomerization enthalpies for 246 different 
molecular species from 65  isomeric groups  using the Gaussian 4 theory composite method  
[15]. The molecules range from the 3 atomic species to those with 12 atoms with at least  one 
known interstellar molecule from each isomeric group . The results account for the extent and 
effectiveness of isomeri zation as a plausible formation route in ISM; and the rationale behind 
the successful observation of the known species. Among other things, potential candidates for 
astron omical searches are highlighted and discussed.       
 
Computational Details : A concerted effort between theory and experiment is found in the 
heart of some of the most successful scientific studies. Considering the large range of 
molecules examined in this study, only very few of them have experimentally measured 
enthalpies of format ion while others are so unstable that they cannot be probed 
experimentally in the terrestrial laboratory but all of these can be comfortably handled 
computationally. The Gaussian 4 (G4) theory composite method is employed in estimating 
accurate standard en thalpies of formation ( ΔfHO) for all the molecular systems investigated in 
this work. The G4 composite method is very accurate for several systems and benchmark 
studies; in its release note, it has an average absolute deviation of 0.8 kcal/mol from 
experim ental values for the enthalpies of formation of 270 molecular species. The G4 method 
is a modification of the G3 method which has an average absolute deviation of 1.19 kcal/mol 
for the same number of molecular systems  [15-16]. In the G4 method, geometry op timization 
and zero point energy (ZPE) are carried out at the  B3LYP level of theory using the 6 -
31G(2df,p) basis set. The ZPE is scaled by 0.9854.  Single -point calculations and energy are 
done using the MP4/6 -31G(d) method modified by corrections from addi tional calculations 
(with MP4 and other methods) while core correlation is obtained via higher -level correction 
terms.  The Gaussian 09 suite of programs is used for all the computational studies reported 
here. Only stable geometries with no imaginary frequ encies are considered. The standard 6 
 enthalpies of formation are obtained from the atomization energies using the approach 
described in previous studies [4-6, 17 -23] 
Results and Discussion  
The standard enthalpies of formation ( ΔfHO) for all the 246 molecular species from 65  
isomeric groups  examined in this study are contained in the supporting information.  The 
relative enthalpies  for each isomeric group are presented and discussed in this section. The 
different isomeric groups investigated are grouped according to the number of atoms 
beginning from 3 to 12.  
 
Isomers with 3 atoms  
 In Table 4, the relative enthalpies or isomerizati on energies of the 26 molecular species from 
13 isomeric groups with 3 atoms are shown alongside the current astronomical status of these 
species. At least one isomer from each of the se isomeric groups  is a known interstellar 
molecule  [24-43]. The isomerization enthalpies range from 0.2 to 41.5 kcal/mol for groups 
where both isomers have been detected.  This range illustrates the effectiveness of the 
isomerization mechanism as a plausible route for the formation of these molecular species in 
ISM;  it also shows how far or the extent to which the energy sources within the ISM can 
drive some chemical processes. For the isomeric groups where only one isomer has been 
detected, the observed range of the relative enthalpy of formation  suggests that speci es like 
NaNC, AlCN, ONC- and even HOC can be formed from their most stable isomers that have 
been detected already. The high abu ndance s of the stable isomers coupled with the energy 
sources in ISM imply the possibility of these less stabl e isomers being  formed from their 
most stable isomers via the isomerization mechanism.    
 
With the exception of C 2N group where only the less stable isomer is been detected, in all 
other cases where only one isomer is detected, it is the most stable isomer  which support s the 
fact that the most stable isomer is probably the most abundant and the most abundant species 
is easily detected compared to the less stable isomer.  Where both isomers have been detected, 
the most stable isomer is found to be the most abundant except where other processes 
dominate . CNC is more stable than CCN but the less stable i somer has been detected while 
the most stable isomer is yet to be astronomically observed . From literature perusal, there is 
no information regarding the sp ectroscopic parameters of CNC th at would have warranted it 
astronomical searches. Thus, the detection of CNC awaits the availability of accurate  
spectroscopic parameters.  
Ions (both cations and anions) play important role in the formation processes of interstellar 
molecules. Under the conditions of the ISM, neutral atoms and molecules tend to be 
unreactive toward molecular hydrogen but in the presence of ions, most of the reactions 
become very efficient since the ions can easily react without having to overcome the rea ction 
barrier  [7,44] . This can be seen in the case of the CHO+ group where HOC+ with a  relative 
enthalpy of formation  of 37.3 kcal/mol has been detected. Theoretical calculations and 
laboratory experiment s have shown that the isomerization process in the CHO+ isomers has 
essentially no barrier  [14]. Thus, with the availability of accurate spectroscopic parameters, 7 
 the HSC+ and ONC- ions (where their most stable isomers are already detected) could be 
success fully detected.   
Isomerization appears to be a favourable route for the cyanide/isocyanide pair. Table 4 
contains 7 cyanide/isocyanide pairs of which both cyanide and isocyanide have been detected 
in three groups with isomerization energy ranging from 0.2  to 13.5 kcal/mol.   Except for the 
ONC- ion with a  relative enthalpy of formation  of 17.1kcal/mol; the remaining members of 
the cyanide/isocyanide pairs have relative enthalpy of formation  in the range of 0.0 to 7.3 
kcal/mol which is well within the range of those already detected. Thus, NaNC, AlCN and 
CNC are most likely to be formed from their corresponding analogues and could be 
successfully detected.

Isomers with 4 atoms  
For the isomers with 4 atoms, 2 5 molecular species from 10  isomeric groups are examined. 
Table 5 contains the isomerization energies of these molecular species and their current 
astronomical status.  Four teen of these molecular species have been detected from different 
astronomical sources  [45-63]. In the CHON , CHSN , and C 3H groups where more than one 
isomer has been detected, the relative enthalpy of formation  ranges from 3.1 to 67.4 kcal/mol. 
For the remaining 7 isomeric groups with only one known molecular species from each, the 
relative enthalpy of formation  ranges from 21.6 to 49.8 kcal/mol. This range falls within that 
of the known species, thus, pointing to the possibility of detecting the less stable isomers of 
these groups that could be formed via the isomerization process.  
Among the isomers with 4 at oms examined here, there are eight  cyanide/isocyanide pairs. In 
two of these pairs, both cyanide and isocyanide have been detected with a  relative enthalpy of 
formation  in the range of 2.8  to 29.0 kcal/mol. For the other cyanide/isocyanide  pairs where 
only the cyanides are observed, the relative enthalpy of formation  ranges from 18.7 to 24.7 
kcal/mol which is below the 2 9.0 kcal/mol relative enthalpy of formation  calculated  for the 
known cyanide/isocyanide  pairs.  Thus, isomerization remain s a plausible mechanism for the 
formation of the less stable isocyanides from their corresponding cyanides which are 
probably more abundant.  
The C 2N2 isomeric group is the isoelectronic analogue of the C 2NP isomeric group. Just as 
there is interesting chemistry between the O and S -containing interstellar molecular species; 
such also exists for the N and P -containing species, though it is not well explored as that of O 
and S. Over 80% of all the known interstellar and circumstellar molecules have been de tected 
via their rotational spectral features because, at the low temperature of the ISM, rotational 
excited states are easily populated. NC 2N (the most stable isomer of the C 2N2 group) is 
microwave inactive meaning that it cannot be astronomically detecte d via radio astronomy. 
There are reasons to believe the presence and detectability of NC 2N; its protonated analogue, 
NC 2NH+ has been detected [64]. NCCP, the isoelectronic analogue of NC 2N is also known 
[62]. Both the protonated analogues of NC 2N and its i soelectronic analogue that have been 9 
 observed are likely to be less abundant than NC 2N because of the reactive nature of the ion 
and the less cosmic abundance of P as compared to N. Thus, infrared astronomy of NCCN or 
radio astronomy of its isotopologues ( which are microwave active) is likely to be successful.   
The observed isomers in all the groups shown in Table 5 are also the most stable isomers.

Isomers with 5 atoms  
Isomerization energies for 2 0 molecular species  from 6 isomeric groups are presented in 
Table 6 alongside their current astronomical status . Nine of these species are known 
astromolecules  [65-73]. In the C 3HN and C 3H2 groups where more than one isomer has been 
detected, the isomerization energy ranges from 13.7 to 45.4 kcal/mol , and the isomerization 
energies for some of the isomers with f ive atoms whose most stable isom ers have been 
detected fall within this range.  These include; ethynol, C H2NN, NH 2NC, CH 2NC, HCONC 
and c-C2NHO. These species can as well be formed from their most stable isomers via the 
isomerization mechanism.  
 
Again, isomerization appears to be a favourable route for the formation of isocyanides from 
their corresponding cyanides. As shown in Table 6, an isomerization enthalpy as high as 45.4 
kcal/mol is noted for an isocyanide formation. This strongly supports t he formation of other 
isocyanides from their corresponding cyanides. The barrier for other isocyanides whose 
corresponding cyanides have been detected ranges from 12.9 to 43.4 kcal/mol which is within 
the limit of the one that has been observed.   
The fact  that the most stable isomers are pro bably the most abundant and  are easily detected 
in ISM is well demonstrated among these isomers. From table 6, all the observed isomers are

 Isomers with 6 atoms  
The isomerization energies and the current astronomical status of the different isomeric 
species with 6 atoms investigated in this study are presented in Table 7. Figures 1 to 5 display 
some of the cyclic isomers highlighted in Table 7. One -third of all th e molecular species 
presented in Table 7 have all been detected from several astronomical sources [74-85]. In the 
C2H3N and H 2C3O groups where more than one isomer has been detected, the isomerization 
enthalpies range from 7.3 to 23.1 kcal/mol. Except for some of the cyclic isomers which are 
highly unstable, most of the unknown isomers (c -C5N*, C 4NC, c -C5N**, c -C5Ha, SiH 3NC, 
HC 3NC, methylene ketene, hydroxymethylimine) have isomerization enthalpies in the range 
of the known isomers, suggesting their possibl e astronomical observation if they could be 
formed via isomerization as the ones that have been observed. Ketenimine for instance is 
reported to be formed from methyl cyanide via tautomerization (i.e., an isomerization 
pathway in which the migration of hyd rogen atom from the methyl group to the nitrogen 
atom is accompanied by a rearrangement of bonding electrons) and this process is said to be 
driven by shock waves that provide the energy for both the formation and distribution of 
large interstellar species  [80].  
The C 5H isomers; l -C5H and c -C5Ha are almost identical in energy. If the spectroscopic 
parameters of c -C5Ha (Figure 2a) are accurately probed, either experimentally or 
theoretically; this species (c -C5H) could be detected in ISM. The four cyanide/ isocyanide 
pairs among the isomers with 6 atoms presented in Table 7 have isomerization enthalpies in 
the range of 4.5 to 23.0 kcal/mol. Interestingly, the C 2H3N group where methyl cyanide and 
methyl isocyanide have been detected has the highest relative e nthalpy of formation  of 23.0 
kcal/mol which implies the possible detection of the other isocyanides with lower barriers 
(4.5 to 20.7kcal/mol) assuming isomerization as their plausible formation route.  
Methylene ketene and methyl ketene have been proposed as potential interstellar molecules 
for many reasons.   The ketenes are found to be more stable than their corresponding isomers 
(Tables 6, 7, and 9); they are less affected by interstellar hydrogen bonding assuming surface 
formation processes; ketene and k etenyl radical (H 2C2O and HC 2O respectively) are known 
interstellar molecules [64; 68] .  
Just as every known O -containing interstellar molecule points to the presence and the 
detectability of the S -analogue. F or every known S -species, the O -analogue is not  only 
present in detectable abundance, but it can also be said to have even been overdue for 
astronomical detection. C 5O is the O -analogue of C 5S that has been detected. Thus, it is an 
important potential interstellar molecule.

Isomers with 7 atoms  
Table 8 shows the isomerization energies and the current astronomical status of different 
isomeric species with 7 atoms investigated in this study. Of the  22 molecular species in the 
Table, 7 have been astronomically observed  [86-93]. In the H 4C2O isomeric group where all 
the isomers have been detected, the isomerization energies range from 12.2 to 27.8 kcal/mol. 
All the non -observed isomers in the H 3C3N and C 3H4 isomeric groups including, 
cyanomethanol, iminoacetaldehyde, and methyl cyanate (from C 2H3NO isomeric group) have 
isomerization enthalpies in the range calculated for the H 4C2O isomers which have all been 
detected. This points to the possibility o f detecting these molecules in ISM with relative 
enthalpy of formation  within those of the known interstellar molecules. There is no 
cyanide/isocyanide pair observed among these systems, however, the relative enthalpy of 
formation  in the range of 19.9 to 2 7.3 kcal/mol is within the range of those noted for other 
observed cyanide/isocyanide pairs.  
  
 As in the previous examples, all the observed isomers are the most stable ones in their 
respective groups. In the H 4C2O isomeric group where all the stable iso mers have been 
observed, the most stable isomer; acetaldehyde was first observed before the other isomers. 
As would be expected, the most stable isomer (acetaldehyde) is present in high abundance in 
16 
 the different astronomical sources where it has been dete cted as compared to the abundances 
of the less stable isomers in the same sources [94-96].

 Isomers with 8 atoms  
Table 9 contains the isomerization energies for 33 isomeric species from 7 groups containing 
eight atoms each. The astronomical statuses of these species  are also shown in the table. 
Figure 6 highlights the cyclic isomers from the C 2H5N and CH 4N2O groups. As shown in 
Table 9, 11 of these species have been astronomically detected [97-109]. The isomerization 
energies of these species range from 3.1 to 50.0 kcal/mol. Except for 1,2 -dioxetane, 1,3 -
dioxetane, and epoxyproprene, the isomerization energies for all the unknown isomers with 8 
atoms fall within the range (of 13.0 to 46.9 kcal/mol) of the known isomers (3.1 to 50.0 
kcal/mol). Thus, some of the unknown isomers in Table 9 could be formed from their most 
stable isomers (which are probably more abundant) via the isomerization process.  
  
The three cyanide/isocyanide pairs among these iso mers have isomerization enthalpies 
ranging from 19.0 to 25.6 kcal/mol. Though no cyanide/isocyanide pair has been detected 
among these molecular species, the relative enthalpy of formation  is within the range of those 
where the pairs have been detected. CH 3CCNC and H 2NCH 2NC could be formed from their 
corresponding cyanides that have been detected, thus, they could also be detected provided 
their spectroscopic parameters are accurately known. Methyl ketene, the most stable isomer 
of the H 4C3O group is yet to  be astronomically detected. The reasons for its presence and 
detectability in ISM are the same as discussed for methylene ketene (among the isomers with 
6 atoms).

Isomers with 9 atoms  
In Table 10, 28 isomeric species from 7 groups are presented with their isomerization 
enthalpies and current astronomical status. Eight of these species are known interstellar 
molecular species  [110-120]. Figure 7 shows some of the cyclic molecules with 9 atoms.  
Among the species  shown in Table 10, only ethanol and dimethyl ether from the C 2H6O 
group have been observed in more than one isomeric form with a  relative enthalpy of 
formation  of 12.6 kcal/mol. CH 3SCH 3, the S -analogue of dimethyl ether remains a potential 
candidate for astronomical detec tion for many reasons; the well -established chemistry of S 
and O -containing interstellar molecules, the high abundance of CH 3CH 2SH (the most stable 
isomer of the group which can isomerize to CH 3SCH 3) and the low relative enthalpy of 
formation  (1.4 kcal/mol) as compared to that of dimethyl ether (12.6 kcal/mol). Assuming 
20 
 accurate spectroscopic parameters are available, interstellar CH 3SCH 3 will soon become a 
reality.   
 
Isomerization remains one of the plausible formation routes for the formation of the less 
stable isomers of the different groups here whose most stable isomers have been detected. 
The isomerization enthalpies for the two cyanide/isocyanide pairs range from 20.8 to 27.1 
kcal/mol. Though none of these pairs has been detected, the possibility of their formation 
from their corresponding cyanides (via isomerization) which could lead to their successful 
detection cannot be r uled out. HC 6NC is the highest member of the HC 2nNC linear chains 
with experimentally measured rotational transitions that can be used for its astronomical 
search  [121] .  However, a recent study using a combined experimental and theoretical 
approach has provided accurate rotational constants for higher members of the HC 2nNC linear 
chains  [6]. HNC remains the only member of this series that has been detected in ISM  [122] .

Isomers with 10 atoms  
Isomerization energies and astronomical statuses for 16 molecular species from three 
isomeric groups comprising 10 atoms each are presented in Table 11. Of these three groups, 
only the C 3H6O group contains isomers (propanone and propa nal) that have been detected in 
more than one isomeric form with a  relative enthalpy of formation  of 8.1 kcal/mol  [123-127]. 
CH 3(CC) 2NC is the isocyanide analogue of CH 3(CC) 2CN that has been detected. It has a  
relative enthalpy of formation  of 25.3 kcal/mol which is within the range of the known 
cyanide/isocyanide pairs.   However, there is little or no information regarding the rotational 
spectrum of CH 3(CC) 2NC that could warrant its astronomical search. Thus, the availability of 
22 
 accurate spectroscop ic parameters for this species remains the starting point in the steps 
toward its astronomical detection.  
  
1,1-ethanediol; the most stable isomer of the C 2H6O2 group has not been detected whereas 
ethylene glycol, the next stable isomer of the group with a n isomerization enthalpy of 
6.1kcal/mol has been detected in good abundance. The delayed astronomical detection of 1,1 -
ethanediol is directly linked to a lack of spectroscopic parameters for this molecule. The 
rotational spectrum of 1,1 -ethanediol is yet t o be probed either experimentally or 
theoretically. Once this is done, this molecule could be successfully observed.

Isomers with 11 atoms  
There are currently seven  known interstellar molecules (HC 9N, CH 3C6H, ethyl formate, 
methyl acetate , hydroxyacetone, cyclopentadiene  and ethanolamine ) containing  11 atoms  
[128-134]. In Table 12, the 9 isomeric species from two groups containing 11 atoms are 23 
 shown with their isomerization enthalpies and current astronomical status.  For the known 
isomers in the C3H6O2 group, the isomerization energy ranges from 11.8 to 14.3 kcal/mol. 
The non -detection or delayed detection of propanoic acid (the most stable isomer of the 
group) has been traced to the effect of interstellar hydrogen bonding on the surface of the dust 
grains which reduces the overall abundance of this species in the gas phase, thus, influencing 
its successful astronomical observation. HC 9N is the second largest member of the 
cyanopolyyne chain that has been detected in ISM. As seen in other cyanide/isocyani de pairs, 
the isomerization of HC 9N to HC 8NC with  the relative enthalpy of formation  of 27.2 is 
achievable. An a ccurate rotational constant for HC 8NC is now available from a recent study  
[6; 17] . Thus, HC 8NC could be astronomically searched.

Isomers with 12 atoms  
Only very few cyclic molecules are known among the interstellar molecular species [17; 20 -
21. From the different isomeric groups considered in this study, it is clear that the cyclic 
isomers are found to be among the less stable isomers in their respective  groups as compared 
to their corresponding straight -chain analogues. This low stability could affect their 
interstellar abundance and influences their astronomical observation. The C 6H6 isomeric 
group is one of the few groups where the cyclic molecules are  found to be the most stable 
species. Apart from cyanocyclopentadiene and 2 -cyanocyclopentadiene that have been 
recently observed in the interstellar medium [135-136], the other  four known interstellar 
molecules with 12 atoms, [137-140] their corresponding  isomers, and isomerization 
enthalpies are presented in Table 13.    
 The only known branched -chain interstellar molecule; isopropyl cyanide is almost equivalent 
in energy to its linear chain analogue; propyl cyanide with a  relative enthalpy of formation  of 
0.4kcal/mol. Propan -2-ol and propanol (the two most stable isomers of the C 3H6O group) are 
yet to be astronomically observed. These species have also been shown to be strongly 
affected by interstellar hydrogen bonding as compared to ethyl methy l ether tha t has been 
detected [6; 18 -21]. The stability of ethyl methyl ether is also enhanced by the stabilizing 
effect of the two alkyl substituents while propanol and propan -2-ol have only one alkyl 
substituent each.

Potential Interstellar Molecules  
Knowing the right candidates for astronomical searches is vital in reducing the number of 
unsuccessful astronomical searches considering the time, energy and resources involved in 
these projects. From the present study, few molecular species have been iden tified as 
potential interstellar molecules. These are briefly summarized below:  
 
Isocyanomethylidyne, CNC : This is the isocyanide analogue of C 2N that has been detected  
[141] . CNC is found to be more  stable than its cyanide analogue. Table 14 contains the 
relative energies of CNC and CCN from different quantu m chemical calculation methods 
while Figure 8 shows the optimized geometries of these isomers at the MP2(full)/6 -
311++G** level with the bond angle in degrees and bond distance in angstroms. As discussed 
under the isomers with 3 atoms, all the observed species are the most stable ones and these 
stable species are also found to be more abundant . Where both species have been detected, 
the mos t stable is reported  to present in high abundance than th e less stable. For instance, 
HCN is  found to be more abundant than HNC in different molecular clouds  and this is also 
the case for the MgNC/MgCN abundance ratio measured in the asymptotic giant branch 
(AGM) stars  [142-145]. CNC is more stable than CCN whic h implies that CNC should be 
present in high abundance in I SM tha n CCN that has been detected. Thus, CNC remains a 
potential candidate for astronomical detection. CNC is microwave inactive with a zero-dipole  
moment;  thus, infrared astronomy remains the best approach for its astronomical observation.

 NCCN : The rationale for the choice of NCCN as a potential interstellar molecule is well 
discussed under the isomers with 4 atoms.  
 
c-C5H: With the limited number of known cyclic interstellar molecules, it is always exciting 
finding rings that are as stable as their corresponding chains. c -C5H (Figure 2a) is the cyclic 
analogue of C 5H that has been detected. From Table 7, the relative  enthalpy of formation  
between the linear chain and this cyclic analogue is just 1 kcal/mol. Table 15 shows the 
relative energies of these species at different quantum chemical calculation me thods. While 
the MP2 method  predicts the cyclic isomer to be more  stable than the linear, others methods 
predict the reverse but the magnitude of the difference in energy is much at the MP2 level as 
compared to other methods. Figure 9 displays the optimized structures of these species. As 
shown in Table 15, c -C5H is mic rowave active with a very good dipole moment making its 
astronomical searches in the radio frequency possible. If the spec troscopic parameters of c -
C5H  can be accurately probed, either experimentally or theoretically, the possibility of its 
astronomical observation is very high.

Methylene and Methyl Ketenes : As highlighted in the text, the ketenes are found to be more 
stable than their corresponding isomers in all the isomeric groups examined in this study 
(Tables 6, 7 and 9) and as such be  present in detectable amounts in ISM.  Ketenes have also 
been shown to be less affected by hydrogen bonding on the surface of the interstellar dust 
grains as compared to their corresponding isomers. Also, the fact that ketene (H 2C2O), 
ketenyl radical (HC 2O) and isomers of ketenes (like propynal, cyclopropenone, and propenal) 
are known interstellar molecular species further supports the presence and detectability of 
28 
 methyl ketene and methylene ketene in ISM. Thus, methyl ketene and methylene kenetne 
remain potential interstellar molecules pending their astronomical searches. No unsuccessful 
astronomical search has been reported for any of these ketenes.  
C5O: This is the oxygen analogue of C 5S which is a known interstellar molecule. Without 
any exception, an interstellar O -containing molecular species is more abundant than its S -
analogue. This could simply be traced to the cosmic abundance of O and S. Thus, for every 
known S -species, the O -analogue is not only present in detectable abundance, but it can also 
be said to have even been overdue for astronomical detection because for sure the O -species 
are more abundant than their S -analogue and as such could be detected with less difficulty as 
compared to its S -analogue. The column density of 2.14x 1012cm-2 report ed for C 5S suggests the - 
high abundance of C 5O in ISM [62; 85] . The microwave spectrum of C 5O that could guide its 
successful astronomical observation is available  [146] . Interstellar C 5O is just a matter of 
time.  
CH 3SCH 3: This is the S -analogue of dimethyl ether; a known interstellar molecule. The 
interstellar chemistry of S - and O -containing species is well established. Every known O -
containing interstellar molecule points to the presence and detectability of the S -analogue. As 
earlier mentioned, e xcept where the effect of interstellar hydrogen bonding dominates, the 
ratio of an interstellar sulphur molecule to its oxygen analogue is close to the cosmic S/O 
ratio. Assuming dimethyl ether is formed from ethanol via isomerization with a barrier of 
12.6 kcal/mol, then the isomerization of C 2H5SH to CH 3SCH 3 is a much more feasible 
process with a  relative enthalpy of formation  of just 1.4 kcal/mol (nine times lower than that 
of CH 3OCH 3) compared to that of the O -analogue. Thus, because of the unique chemistry of 
S- and O -containing interstellar molecules and the low relative enthalpy of formation , 
CH 3SCH 3 is considered a potential candidate for astronomical observation assuming its 
spectroscopic parameters are accurately known.   
1,1-Ethanediol, Propanoic Acid, Propan -2-ol, and Propanol : These molecules are found 
to be the most stable isomers in their respective groups (Tables 11, 12, and 13). Whereas their 
less stable isomers have been a stronomically detected; successful detection of these most 
stable isomers is highly feasible. The spectroscopic parameters for propanoic acid, propan -2-
ol, and propanol are known but those of 1,1 -ethanediol are yet to come by. Though the 
delayed astronomic al observations of some of these species have been linked to the effect of 
interstellar hydrogen bonding; there are high chances for their successful astronomical 
detection.  
 Conclusion : An extensive investigation of the isomerization energies of  246 molec ular 
species from 65 isomeric groups  is reported in this study. From the results, isomerization is 
found to be one of the plausible mechanisms for the formation of molecules in ISM. The high 
abundances of the most stable isomers coupled with the energy sou rces in ISM drive the 
isomerization process even for barriers as high as 67.4 kcal/mol.  However, the chemical 
reaction pathways can also influence the final abundance of any species in the 
ISM.  Specifically, the isomerization process is found to be very effective in converting 
cyanides to their corresponding isocyanides and vice versa. Thus, f or every cyanide or 
isocyanide, the corresponding isocyanide or cyanide could be synthesized via isomerization. 
Also, from the results, the following potential inter stellar molecules;  CNC, NCCN, c -C5H, 29 
 methylene ketene, methyl Ketene, CH 3SCH 3, C5O, 1,1-ethanediol, propanoic acid, propan -2-
ol, and propanol are highlighted and discussed
