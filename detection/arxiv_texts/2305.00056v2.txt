ABSTRACT
The astrophysical environments capable of triggering heavy-element synthesis via rapid neutron
capture (the r-process) remain uncertain. While binary neutron star mergers (NSMs) are known to
forge r-process elements, certain rare supernovae (SNe) have been theorized to supplement—or even
dominate— r-production by NSMs. However, the most direct evidence for such SNe, unusual reddening
of the emission caused by the high opacities of r-process elements, has not been observed. Recent work
identified the distribution of r-process material within the SN ejecta as a key predictor of the ease
with which signals associated with r-process enrichment could be discerned. Though this distribution
results from hydrodynamic processes at play during the SN explosion, thus far it has been treated only
in a parameterized way. We use hydrodynamic simulations to model how disk winds—the alleged locus
ofr-production in rare SNe—mix with initially r-process-free ejecta. We study mixing as a function
of the wind mass and duration and of the initial SN explosion energy, and find that it increases with
the first two of these and decreases with the third. This suggests that SNe accompanying the longest
long-duration gamma-ray bursts are promising places to search for signs of r-process enrichment.
We use semianalytic radiation transport to connect hydrodynamics to electromagnetic observables,
allowing us to assess the mixing level at which the presence of r-process material can be diagnosed
from SN light curves. Analytic arguments constructed atop this foundation imply that a wind-driven
r-process-enriched SN model is unlikely to explain standard energetic SNe.

1.INTRODUCTION
The high free-neutron flux required for the synthesis
of heavy elements through rapid neutron capture (the
r-process; Burbidge et al. 1957; Cameron 1957) has ren-
dered the astrophysical site(s) of r-process production
an enduring mystery. The multimessenger detection
of the neutron star merger (NSM) GW170817 (Abbott
et al. 2017) confirmed (Drout et al. 2017; Kasen et al.
2017; Kasliwal et al. 2017; Tanaka et al. 2017; Watson
et al. 2019) the long-standing theory that the decom-
pression of NS material following its disruption during a
merger could trigger an r-process (Lattimer & Schramm
1974, 1976; Symbalisty & Schramm 1982; Meyer 1989;
Davies et al. 1994; Freiburghaus et al. 1999). However,
questions remain as to whether NSMs can explain the
full pattern of r-process enrichment observed across time
jlbarnes@kitp.ucsb.eduand space (e.g., Cˆ ot´ e et al. 2019; Zevin et al. 2019; van
de Voort et al. 2020; Jeon et al. 2021; Molero et al. 2021;
de los Reyes et al. 2022; Naidu et al. 2022; Cavallo et al.
2023; Kobayashi et al. 2023).
Amid these uncertainties, “collapsars”—the core-
collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions of rapidly rotat-
ing massive stars (MacFadyen & Woosley 1999)—have
been investigated as a possible r-process production
site (Pruet et al. 2003; Surman & McLaughlin 2004;
Surman et al. 2006). While conditions in the accretion
disks that form post-collapse were found to support neu-
tronization in the disk midplane, it was not clear that
this material could remain neutron rich in the face of
successive neutrino absorptions, which were believed to
be the mechanism responsible for ejecting matter from
the disk. Recently, Siegel et al. (2019) proposed that
magnetic turbulence unbinds the newly neutron-rich
material, limiting opportunities for neutrino absorption
and allowing the resulting wind to undergo an r-process
as it expands. However, simulations of collapsar disksarXiv:2305.00056v2  [astro-ph.HE]  7 Jun 20232 Barnes & Duffell
employing different neutrino transport schemes disagree
on how neutron-rich any ejected material would be,
and therefore on the plausibility of collapsars as sites
of robust heavy element production (Miller et al. 2020;
Fujibayashi et al. 2022; Just et al. 2022a). Avenues
beyond simulation may help break this impasse.
The collapsar model was originally conceived of (Mac-
Fadyen & Woosley 1999) as an explanation for long
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and the unusually energetic
“broad-lined” Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) observed
to accompany them (Galama et al. 1998; Iwamoto et al.
1998; Woosley et al. 1999; Mazzali et al. 2003). The
r-process collapsar hypothesis exists within this frame-
work. If collapsars eject r-process-rich disk winds, these
winds will be embedded in the SN ejecta, and the
uniquely high opacity of heavy r-process compositions
(Kasen et al. 2013; Tanaka & Hotokezaka 2013; Tanaka
et al. 2020) could redden the SN emission relative to
what would be expected for an r-process-free explosion.
This points to SN observations as an important tool for
assessing r-production in collapsars, i.e., the collapsa R-
process.
The potential impact of r-process material on SN sig-
nals was mentioned by Siegel et al. (2019), but was
systematically studied only later by Barnes & Met-
zger (2022, hereafter BM22), who used semianalytic ra-
diation transport methods to model emission from r-
process-enriched CCSNe ( rCCSNe) across a broad sec-
tor of parameter space. They found that the extent
of the reddening depends sensitively on how thoroughly
ther-process elements are mixed into the ordinary SN
ejecta, with the degree of mixing a free parameter of
their model.
If an rCCSN launches a wind, some mixing is expected
generically, due to hydrodynamic instabilities thought
develop at the interface between the high-velocity wind
and the presumably slower ejecta composed of ordinary
stellar material and/or explosively synthesized56Ni.
However, a complete understanding of mixing requires
knowledge about the nature of the explosions that give
rise to GRBs and SNe Ic-BL, which remains a topic of
active inquiry (e.g., Burrows et al. 2007; Kumar et al.
2008; M¨ osta et al. 2015; Sobacchi et al. 2017; Gottlieb
et al. 2022a,b; Eisenberg et al. 2022; Halevi et al. 2023).
The large quantities of56Ni inferred for SNe Ic-BL
(Prentice et al. 2016; Taddia et al. 2019) have often, in
the context of the collapsar model, been attributed to
56Ni-burning in collapsar disk outflows (e.g., Pruet et al.
2003; Nagataki et al. 2006; Surman et al. 2006). How-
ever, the r-process collapsar scenario holds that these
outflows instead burn heavier elements, and so requires a
distinct mechanism to explain observed SNe Ic-BL56Nimasses. A favored—though not universal—alternative
to the56Ni-wind scenario is a prompt explosion phase
that rapidly injects energy into the inner layers of the
collapsing star (Maeda & Tominaga 2009; Suwa & Tom-
inaga 2015).
The general picture of the collapsa R-process thus in-
cludes a prompt explosion, the subsequent formation
and dissipation of an accretion disk, and, in some cases,
an ultrarelativistic GRB jet. Each of these processes
has the potential to influence the dynamics of the SN
explosion, but the manner in which they fit together—
their relative importance and even their chronology—is
uncertain, motivating a survey of mixing behavior over
a wide range of explosion models.
We perform hydrodynamic calculations of wind-ejecta
mixing in collapsar-generated SN outflows. Our hydro-
dynamics set-up is described in §2, and the results of our
calculations can be found in §3. In §4, we use radiation
transport to predict light curves for a subset of our mod-
els, and discuss the implications of our results for efforts
to observe rCCSNe. We contextualize our findings and
discuss future research directions in §5.
2.METHODS
We model collapsar wind mixing with the special rela-
tivistic, moving-mesh hydrodynamics code Jet(Duffell
& MacFadyen 2013, 2015), which we have (ironically)
adapted to simulate a spherical wind outflow.
2.1. Stellar Progenitor
We begin with an analytic progenitor model represen-
tative of the stripped-envelope stars generally presumed
(e.g., Yoon & Langer 2005; Woosley & Heger 2006; Mod-
jaz et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2016; Taddia et al. 2019) to
explode as GRB-SNe and SNe Ic-BL. We used the same
progenitor in earlier work on jet-driven SNe (Barnes
et al. 2018). It corresponds to an evolved, stripped
star with a pre-collapse mass and radius of 5 .0M⊙and
1.6R⊙, respectively.
We assume that the innermost layers of the progenitor
have collapsed to a black hole, and approximate the ef-
fects of this collapse by introducing a low-density cavity
interior to rcav= 9×10−4R0, with R0the progenitor
radius. The progenitor is spherically symmetric and has
a mass density that depends on the radial coordinate as

according to Eq. 1. However, we do not resolve the cen-
tral remnant or the surrounding accretion disk. The
pre-collapse progenitor mass is therefore greater than
the total mass on our computational grid.
2.2. Hydrodynamics set-up
Our initially stationary progenitor is exploded by an
accretion disk wind and, in some cases, an additional
prompt explosion. We parameterize the disk wind by
its mass, Mw, its characteristic timescale τw, its velocity
vw, and the time at which it begins, t0,w. The wind is
injected into the progenitor via source terms in energy,

and radial momentum,

In Eq. 2, r0= 2×10−4R0< rcavis the radius at which
the wind injection peaks, and ˙Ew=Mwv2
w/2τwis the
characteristic wind power. Eqs. 2–4 ensure that the
time- and volume-integrated mass (energy) introduced
into the progenitor is Mw(Mwv2
w/2).∗
We track the distribution of wind material in the
ejecta from t0,wuntil the end of the simulation using
a passive scalar.
In the parlance of this project, models that also un-
dergo a prompt explosion are said to have a non-zero
initial explosion energy E0. We induce a prompt explo-
sion in these models by seeding the inner layers of the
progenitor with excess thermal energy, which takes the
form of an additional pressure term,
Pexp(r) =(Γ−1)E0
π3/2r3exp×exp[−(r/rexp)2], (5)
where Γ = 4 /3 is the adiabatic index, E0is the energy
of the prompt explosion, and rexp= 2rcav. The total
∗We note that our formulation for radial momentum (Eq. 4)
is more traditionally applied to highly relativistic systems. For a
more modestly relativistic flow, like our wind, the effect is to seed
the outflowing material with a combination of kinetic and thermal
energy. Because we inject the wind within a cavity, its expansion
in a low-density medium enables the efficient conversion of thermal
to kinetic energy, and when it reaches the cavity boundary it has
accelerated to ∼vw.pressure in the progenitor, prior the introduction of the
wind, is

with the behavior for E0= 0 approximating the limit of
a cold gas.
At least some of the collapsars believed to generate
r-process disk outflows are likely to be accompanied
by ultrarelativistic GRB jets. (Indeed, the analogy to
the short GRBs tied to NSMs was the foundation upon
which Siegel et al. (2019) argued for the collapsa R-
process.) Nevertheless, for the sake of simplicity we con-
sider here only the wind and the prompt explosion. We
suspect based on earlier work (Barnes et al. 2018) that
a jet could increase mixing, but that its impact would
be restricted to the narrow region just beyond the jet
opening angle. The calculations here therefore provide
a conservative lower limit on mixing.
We use Jetto evolve the SN-wind system on a two
dimensional, axisymmetric grid divided into zones of size
δr/r∼4.5×10−5andδθ∼6×10−3. Our calculations
begin at a time 1000 times less than the light-crossing
time of the progenitor (i.e., t0= 10−3R0/c) and continue
until t≳1000×R0/c. By this point, the ejecta have
expanded to a few hundred times the original radius of
the progenitor, and the flow has become homologous.
As a result, the hydrodynamic instabilities that drive
mixing have frozen out, and the distribution of wind
matter within the progenitor has achieved its final state.
2.3. Description of Models
Our model suite, which we summarize in Table 1,
explores the impact of three of our four wind param-
eters (we fix vw= 0.1c) and E0on wind-ejecta mix-
ing. We vary the wind mass, Mw, within the range
0.01≤Mw/M0≤0.5.
To explore the role of the prompt explosion, we select
three values of E0corresponding to average kinetic ve-
locities ( vchar,0= (2E0/M0)1/2of 0.01c, 0.03c, and 0 .1c.
In other words, the chosen E0reflect inferred velocities
of fairly slow, typical, and fast (broad-lined) SNe Ic.
Wind-driven models have no prompt explosion ( E0= 0),
and derive their kinetic energy exclusively from disk out-
flows.
We also examine the effect of the wind duration, τw.
We adopt as a fiducial case τw=R0/c, but for certain
combinations of MwandE0, we consider durations that
differ from the fiducial value by a factor of up to 10 in
either direction. (See the beginning of §3.3 for a discus-
sion of our choice of wind durations.)4 Barnes & Duffell
Finally, we explore how the wind start, t0,w, impacts
mixing. In prompt-explosion models, we generally as-
sume that the wind and the explosion begin simulta-
neously when the simulation starts, at t0= 10−3R0/c.
However, disk outflows could lag the prompt explosion
if it takes time for the disk to form and accretion to
begin (e.g., Kohri et al. 2005). Thus, we also con-
sider “delayed-wind” models, for which t0,wranges from
(0.1–10) R0/c. For wind-driven models, the progenitor
is static until the wind begins, so altering t0,whas no
effect on the outcome of the simulation.
As mentioned above, one variable we omit from the
current study is vw, which is 0 .1cin all cases. This choice
was motivated by studies of disk outflows, which predict
wind velocities narrowly clustered around the disk’s es-
cape velocity vesc≈0.1c(e.g., MacFadyen & Woosley
1999). However, for certain magnetic field configura-
tions, vwcould reach 0.2–0.3 c(Christie et al. 2019). We
briefly revisit the question of vwin§4.2.

3.HYDRODYNAMICS RESULTS
Our hydrodynamic calculations predict the final den-
sity profile of the ejecta and the distribution of the r-
process wind matter within it.
3.1. Mixing metrics
The combination of the disk wind and, if present, the
prompt explosion accelerates the ejecta to velocities v∼
0.01–0.1c. The wind inflates a lower-density bubble in
the center of the ejecta, sweeping the ejected material
into a shell whose velocity coordinate scales with the
square root of the outflow’s final kinetic energy ( vρ∝
(E0+Mwv2
w/2)1/2).
Material from the wind is concentrated behind the
density peak. In velocity space, the wind mass fraction

explosion model with Mw/M0= 0.1,E0/M0c2= 5×10−5,
τw=R0/c, and t0,w= 10−3R0/c. However, the behav-
ior they illustrate is representative of models throughout the
parameter space.
(Xw) is effectively a step function that transitions from
Xw= 1 to Xw= 0 at v=vρ. However, since the peak
contains a large fraction of the system’s total mass, the
distribution of wind matter with respect to mass coor-
dinate (a formulation we favor to facilitate comparison
with BM22) is often broader.
To illustrate these concepts, we show in Fig. 1 the fi-
nal angle-averaged mass density profile and wind mass
fraction as a function of velocity for a prompt-explosion
model with Mw/M0= 0.1,E0/M0c2= 5×10−5, and de-
fault time parameters τw=R0/candt0,w= 10−3R0/c.
The bottom panel shows how Xwvaries with the modi-
fied mass coordinate m= (Menc−Mw)/M0, with Menc
the enclosed mass. We have devised mto simplify the
comparison of mixing in models with different Mw.Collapsar wind mixing 5
3.2. Survey of the Mw-E0landscape
We first investigate the effects on mixing of Mwand
E0, while holding constant the wind duration ( τw=
R0/c) and, for prompt-explosion models, the wind start
time ( t0,w= 10−3R0/c, coincident with the start time
of the simulation).
The combination of MwandE0affects both the den-
sity profile of the resulting outflow and the level of mix-
ing. The total kinetic energy of the explosion-plus-wind
system is Ek=E0+Mwv2
w/2, and increasing either
term on the R.H.S. produces a flatter density spike (e.g.,
Fig. 1) at a higher velocity coordinate. This allows the
wind to mix to out to higher velocities, but, because
the entire outflow expands faster, that does not neces-
sarily correspond to greater m. We find that mixing is
stronger for larger wind masses, but the effect of Mw—
as well as the overall level of mixing—diminishes with
E0, as shown in Fig. 2.
The Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that allow the wind
to mix into the initially wind-free ejecta are driven by
the acceleration of the slower outer material by the faster
wind emanating from the core. The wind’s ability to ac-
celerate this outer ejecta depends on the energy it car-
ries, as well as on the initial velocity difference between
the wind and the matter ejected during the prompt ex-
plosion.
We find that the dependence of mixing on MwandE0
for these models can be captured by a parameter, which
we call ζ, proportional to the increase in the product of
the ejecta’s total mass and average velocity due to the
addition of the wind,

is the kinetic energy of the wind, which (since vwdoes
not vary) is a function solely of Mw, and we treat the
mass of the non-wind material, M0as fixed. In Fig. 3,
we plot Xwfor all the models of Fig. 2, color-coded by
ζto demonstrate the validity of this parameterization.
Figs. 2 and 3 make clear that the level of mixing is
not a function only of the wind properties, but instead
depends on the interplay between the wind and any ad-
ditional engine supplying energy to the ejecta. Simu-
lations (e.g., Miller et al. 2020; Just et al. 2022b) pre-
dict that accretion disks will launch winds at velocities
of∼0.05–0.1c, similar to the velocities that character-
ize the energetic SNe Ic-BL—including GRB-SNe—most

Mwdeclines as the prompt explosion becomes more ener-
getic. If E0is large enough to accelerate the ejecta to ve-
locities comparable to vw(which is itself comparable to the
velocities inferred for the most energetic SNe Ic-BL), mixing

likely to harbor such disks. However, if these high-
velocity SNe acquire most of their kinetic energy in a
prompt explosion, even such high wind velocities will
not lead to extensive mixing. On the other hand, if very
kinetic SNe have the high velocities they do because they
are accelerated by a wind, more mixing is expected.

Figure 3. The mixing of the wind into the wind-free ejecta
increases with both the wind mass Mw, and the importance
of the wind as a source of kinetic energy for the SN. We show
above the wind mixing profiles for the models of Fig. 2, color-
coded by the parameter ζ. This quantity, which we define in
Eq. 6, provides a handle on the additional mass and velocity
the wind imparts to the explosion.
The models of §3.2 share a single wind duration, equal
to the light-crossing time of the star ( τw=R0/c). In
nature, the duration of the wind is related to the dissi-
pation time of the accretion disk that supplies it. Since
accretion disks are also the presumed engines of the rela-
tivistic jets that give rise to long GRBs (e.g., MacFadyen
& Woosley 1999; Narayan et al. 2001), GRB dura-
tions should reflect disk—and therefore wind—lifetimes.
However, this correspondence is likely to be most ro-
bust when engine, and ergo GRB, timescales are much
longer than the time the jet requires to break out of
the progenitor star (or the SN ejecta; e.g., De Colle
et al. 2022). In the case of shorter engines, hydrody-
namic processes within the jet-shocked “coccoon” can
extend the the jetted, relativistic flow and therefore the
GRB lifetime, which may obscure the relationship be-
tween engine and GRB durations (Barnes et al. 2018).
Thus, while the observed timescales of GRBs classified
as “long” (2 s ≲T90≲100 s; Kouveliotou et al. 1993)
on their own imply wind lifetimes that span nearly two
orders of magnitude, the lower bound on this range is
conservative, and the actual variance could be greater.
The absence of hydrogen and helium in the spectra of
GRB-SNe and SNe Ic-BL more generally (Modjaz et al.
2014; Liu et al. 2016) implies that the progenitor star
has undergone significant stripping. Fully stripped stars
exhibit less variation in their pre-explosion radii than
their partially stripped counterparts, which can expand

tributed in the ejecta. In all panels, dashed black horizontal

dramatically before collapse as their hydrogen and/or
helium envelopes swell (Laplace et al. 2020). Neverthe-
less, models of the evolution of SNe Ic-BL progenitors
(Aguilera-Dena et al. 2018) suggest that the terminal
radii of these stars range from ∼0.5R⊙to≳3R⊙. If
we assume no correlation between engine duration and
R0, the variation in each of these parameters points to
an engine/wind timescale of 0 .3R0/c≲τw≲100R0/c,
with T90= 2 s and R0= 3.0R⊙(T90= 100 s and R0=
0.5R⊙) defining the lower (upper) bound.
To probe the effect of this variability, we vary τwfrom
0.1R0/cto 10 R0/cfor models with Mw= 0.1M0and
initial explosion energies E0/M0c2= 0, 4 .5×10−4, and

dent with the start time of the simulation. We present
the final mixing profiles in Fig. 4.Collapsar wind mixing 7
Mixing increases with τw. In some cases, the wind
profile is nearly uniform throughout the ejecta. (The
black dashed line in each panel corresponds to a per-
fectly mixed outflow.) However, as was true for Mw
(§3.2), the impact of τwdecreases with E0. For exam-
ple, for wind-driven models, increasing τwfrom 0 .1R0/c
to 10 R0/cchanges the mixing profile from one in which
the wind material resides mainly in a central core to
one in which the wind has mixed almost evenly into the
ejecta. For models with E0/M0c2= 5×10−3, the high-
estτwis still associated with the most mixing, but the
contrast with lower- τwcases is much less stark; even the
best-mixed model concentrates the wind material in the
ejecta’s center.
The greater degree of mixing and the somewhat
bumpier mixing profiles that characterize models with
higher τware both attributable to Raleigh-Taylor in-
stabilities at the wind-ejecta interface, which have more
time to develop when τwis longer. For sufficiently long
τw, these instabilities produce more spatially extended
plumes that are less easily smoothed by angle-averaging.
This can be seen in Fig. 5, which shows the final wind
mass fraction as a function of velocity coordinate and
polar angle for the wind-driven models of Fig. 4. The
instabilities that develop for τw≳R0/ctransport a
significant fraction of the wind mass to higher velocities
and mass coordinates, producing the more homogeneous
mixing profiles apparent in Fig. 4.
We quantify the sensitivity of Xwtoτwby modifying
theζparameter introduced in Eq. 6. Specifically, the
dependence on wind duration can be represented by a
power law, yielding an updated definition,
ζ(Mw, E0, τw) =ζ(Mw, E0)τw
R0/c3/4
. (7)
Eq. 7 explains the variation in mixing patterns for
all models considered thus far, as can be seen in Fig. 6.
The top panel presents the wind mixing profile for every
model of §3.2 and §3.3, color-coded by ζ(Mw, E0, τw).
We also characterize each mixing profile using a sin-
gle parameter m95, defined as the value of the modi-
fied mass coordinate mwithin which 95% of the wind
mass is contained. We plot this quantity as a function
ofζ(Mw, E0, τw) in Fig. 6’s lower panel.†Though some
scatter is evident, ζ(Mw, E0, τw) is clearly predictive of
mixing.
†The model ( Mw, E0, τw) = (0 .5M0,5×10−3M0c2, R0/c)
hasm95=−0.01 (the 95% threshold means values below zero are
technically possible) and cannot be plotted on a log scale, so is
omitted from the lower panel.
Figure 5. Longer wind durations ( τw) more effectively dis-
tribute wind material to higher velocity and mass coordi-
nates, and produce large-scale structures originating in the
wind-ejecta boundary. Each panel above shows the final
wind mass fraction Xwas a function of the radial velocity
coordinate and the polar angle for one of the wind-driven
models of Fig. 4 ( Mw= 0.1M0,t0,w= 10−3R0/c). For
τw≤R0/c, the wind material is mostly confined to a central
core. For longer τw, instabilities develop, allowing tendrils
of wind matter to punch through to the outer layers of the
ejecta.
3.4. Effect of wind start time
The calculations of §3.2 and §3.3 all assume a disk
wind whose launch coincides with an initial explosion,
if there is one. However, if it takes time for the in-
falling material to circularize around the central rem-8 Barnes & Duffell

which curves have been added since Fig. 3. Bottom panel:
We calculate for each model m95, the modified mass coor-
dinate ( m) inside which 95% of that model’s wind mass is
contained, and plot it versus ζ(Mw, E0, τw) to validate the
updated expression for the latter. The essentially linear re-
lationship between ζandm95increases confidence in Eq. 7.
nant (e.g. MacFadyen et al. 2001; Dessart et al. 2008), a
precondition for the formation of the disk that eventu-
ally generates the wind, the wind could conceivably lag
any prompt explosion.
To understand how a delay in the wind launch affects
mixing, we introduce a wind start time parameter, t0,w.
We explore the impact of t0,wusing a subset of models
with ( Mw, E0, τw) = (0 .1M0,4.5×10−4M0c2, R0/c).
In addition to the default value ( t0,w= 10−3R0/c), we
consider t0,w=βR0/c, with β= 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10.In conceptualizing these values, it is instructive to
compare the wind start time to the free-fall time tffof
the progenitor star,
t0,w
tff= 1.3×10−3βM0/M⊙
R0/R⊙1/2
. (8)
As Eq. 8 makes clear, if M∼M⊙andR∼R⊙, as
we can reasonably expect for the progenitors of GRB-
SNe and SNe Ic-BL (see §3.3), even our longest t0,w
accounts for barely 1% of tff. In other words, the wind
is launched (and therefore the disk is assumed to form)
on timescales short relative to the free-fall time. This is
appropriate, since disk formation is enabled by the inner
stellar layers, which have a free-fall/circularization time
much lower than that of the star as a whole. MacFadyen
et al. (2001) find a similarly low ratio of accretion disk
formation time to free-fall timescale, although their pro-
genitor star is more massive and radially extended than
ours.
Increasing t0,wincreases mixing, but the effect is weak,
as demonstrated by Fig. 7. The top panel shows the
final wind mass fraction, Xw, as a function of m. While
a correlation between long delays and enhanced mixing
is evident, the pattern is not perfectly monotonic, owing
to the anomalously low mixing in the model with t0,w=
10R0/c.
In the lower panel, we plot Xwas a function of veloc-
ity coordinate, rather than m, and recover the expected
monotonicity. The reason underlying the discrepancy
can be understood from the inset in the lower panel,
which shows the final density profile for each of the six
models with variable t0,w. The shape of the profile cor-
responding to t0,w= 10R0/chas a broader density peak,
and an elevated density inside that peak, compared to
models with lower t0,w. As a result, its enclosed mass
evolves with velocity in a manner distinct from that
which characterizes the models with t0,w≤3R0/c. In
this case, plotting quantities of interest with respect to
mcan obscure the underlying relationships.
The unique behavior of ρ(v) for t0,w= 10R0/cmost
likely indicates that this delay is long enough to push the
system into a new hydrodynamic regime characterized
by the interaction of thin shells, rather than spatially
extended outflows. Given the insensitivity of mixing to
t0,w, even when the latter is varied by four orders of
magnitude, we do not further investigate this limiting
behavior here.

models we study here, to elucidate general trends we
present synthetic photometry for a handful of cases and
discuss the implications of our findings.
4.1. Model subset photometry
While the r-process mixing pattern is known to im-
pact the emission of the associated SN (Siegel et al.
2019), BM22 demonstrated that the nature of the im-pact depends additionally on factors such as the total
ejected mass and the kinetic energy of the SN.
In light of these overlapping dependencies, models
with fixed E0, fixed Mw, and variable wind durations
(§3.3) represent ideal test cases for exploring the effects
of the various mixing patterns apparent in the full model
suite. While they evince a range of mixing behaviors
(Fig. 4), their shared properties enable a more apples-
to-apples comparison than would be possible for other
model groupings.
We focus on models with Mw= 0.1M0,E0= 4.5×
10−4M0c2, and cτw/R0= 0.1, 1, 3, and 10. These mod-
els have ζ(Mw, E0, τw) = 3×10−3, 1.6×10−2, 3.6×10−2,
and 8 .8×10−2, respectively. As Eq. 7 and Fig. 6 indi-
cate, similar mixing patterns can be achieved by other
parameter combinations.
To calculate the SN emission, we first angle-average
the final mass density profile for each model, and scale
it so all models have a total mass, including the wind
component, of Mej=M0+Mw= 4M⊙, a value typical
of SNe Ic-BL (e.g., Taddia et al. 2019). (If we assume
a remnant black hole mass MBH≳1.4M⊙, this requires
a modest rescaling of our progenitor density profile.)
With this choice, each model represents a SN with a
wind (non-wind ejecta) mass of Mw= 0.36M⊙(M0=
3.64M⊙, and a final kinetic energy Ek= 6.2×1051
erg. The characteristic velocity is 0 .04c, lower than
the fastest expanding SNe Ic-BL, but not inconsistent
with the general population (Modjaz et al. 2016; Taddia
et al. 2019). The assumption of homologous expansion
(valid on timescales relevant to the light curve) com-
pletely specifies the density profile as a function of time.
We likewise angle-average Xw. Our SN models also
include56Ni, the synthesis and mixing of which is not
calculated by JET. Instead, we assume that56Ni is evenly
distributed in the non-wind SN ejecta, so
X56(v) =M56
M0(1−Xw), (9)
with X56the56Ni mass fraction and M56the total mass
of56Ni. We adopt M56= 0.25M⊙, in line with expec-
tations of SNe with our specified MejandEk(Taddia
et al. 2019).
With this assumption, we have all the ingredients re-
quired to perform radiation transport using the semian-
alytic framework introduced in BM22. As in that work,
we assume that r-process material carries an opacity
κrp= 10 cm2g−1, the opacity of56Ni is temperature
dependent, and unenriched SN ejecta has an opacity
κsn= 0.05 cm2g−1. The spectrum of optically thin r-
process material is taken to be well-approximated by a10 Barnes & Duffell
blackbody of temperature T= 2500 K (see Hotokezaka
et al. (2021) or BM22 for details).
The broadband light curves for the four models are
presented in the top panels of Fig. 8. To better disen-
tangle the effects of r-process enrichment from those due
to other factors (changes to the density profile, for exam-
ple), we show in the lower panels a variant of each model
that assumes the wind material has an opacity equal to
that of ordinary SN ejecta. (Put another way, these
models correspond to an explosion scenario in which a
wind is launched, but that wind is free of both r-process
elements and56Ni).
The r-process-enriched models of the top panels are
similar to each other—and similar to their r-process-
free counterparts—for 0 .1≤cτw/R0≤3 (5×10−3≤
ζ≤3.6×10−2), demonstrating that at lower mixing
levels, the effect of r-process enrichment is minimal, at
least for this MejandEk. The situation changes for
τw= 10R0/c. Compared to the other r-process-enriched
models of Fig. 8’s top row, this case shows significant
late-time brightening in the near infrared (NIR) J,H,
andKsbands at the expense of optical emission. The re-
semblance of the r-process-free model with τ= 10R0/c
to the r-process-free models with τw≤3R0/cimplies
that the principal driver of these effects is the distri-
bution of r-process material within the ejecta, rather
than differences in the density profile resulting from the
longer wind duration.
To further clarify the effects of mixing, we show in
Fig. 9 the difference in the r−Kscolor, ∆( r−Ks),
between the r-process-enriched and r-process-free mod-
els of Fig. 8. For ∆( r−Ks) = 0, the NIR flux of a
given r-process-enriched model, relative to its optical
flux, is identical to that of its unenriched analogue, while
∆(r−Ks)<0 indicates enhanced NIR emission from
the enriched SN.
When mixing is negligible, as it is for cτw/R0= 0.1
and 1 .0, the difference in r−Ksdue to the r-process
material is effectively undetectable. At slightly higher
levels of mixing (e.g., ζ= 0.036 for τw= 3R0/c), the
color difference is ≲0.5 mag, and appears only for t≳
100 days. It is only for our best mixed model, with
τw= 10R0/candζ= 0.088, that the r-process material
impacts the colors significantly, and even here, ∆( r−
Ks) does not exceed 1 mag until ∼75 days after the
explosion. It appears that, given the particular density
profiles that arise from our wind-augmented explosion
models, substantial mixing is required to alter the SN
light curves.
Juxtapositions like those of Figs. 8 and 9 are useful
for demonstrating the relationship between mixing and
reddening—namely, that if other parameters are equal,more mixing equates to more reddening at earlier times.
However, we advise against reading too much into these
comparisons, as the r-process-free reference cases were
selected assuming a particular explosion scenario (an ini-
tial spherical explosion enhanced by an r-process-free
disk wind) that may not be realized in nature. Fur-
thermore, the specifics of the r-process signal evident
in Figs. 8 and 9 are a function of our chosen Mej,M56,
andEk, as well as of the r-process parameters. (More
detailed discussions of how to make appropriate com-
parisons between r-process-enriched and r-process-free
models can be found in Barnes & Metzger (2022) and
Anand et al. (2023).)
Thus, while this analysis is useful as a proof of con-
cept, the conclusions we draw from it cannot be trivially
extended to other regions of parameter space. Bearing
this caveat in mind, we cautiously embark on a final ex-
ploration of the corruption of SN signals by well-mixed
r-process-wind material.
4.2. Wind-dominated supernovae
We now turn our focus to wind-dominated SNe—
explosions that derive most of their kinetic energy from
disk outflows. Because the standard neutrino mecha-
nism (Colgate & White 1966; Bethe & Wilson 1985)
cannot account for the high values of Ekascribed to SNe
Ic-BL (e.g., Iwamoto et al. 1998; Mazzali et al. 2014), al-
ternate energy sources must be invoked to explain these
events. Disk winds have been a favored engine candidate
since the inception of the collapsar model (MacFadyen
& Woosley 1999).
We consider SNe of total mass Mej= 4.0M⊙, as in
§4.1, but slightly higher Ek= 8×1051erg, because we
are interested in the SNe whose energies most strongly
suggest an unusual explosion mechanism. In a departure
from earlier sections, we now treat the wind velocity as a
free parameter, rather than fixing vw= 0.1c. Specifying
E0andMwthus determines vwthrough the requirement
that the initial explosion energy and wind energy sum
toEk.
Together with the wind duration τw, these parameters
determine the value of ζ(Eq. 7), which quantifies the ex-
tent of the mixing. For standard SNe Ic-BL masses and
velocities, the arguments of §4.1 (Figs. 8 and 9) identify
ζ≈0.09 as a rough threshold separating rCCSNe with a
detectable r-process signal from those whose r-process
enrichment is well hidden. In Fig. 10, we show for a
handful of initial explosion energies the combination of
wind masses and durations that produce ζ= 0.09 for
SNe with Mej(Ek) equal to 4 .0M⊙(8×1051erg).
Fig. 10 reflects some of the trends identified earlier.
For example, for a given Mw,ζdecreases with E0, soCollapsar wind mixing 11

Figure 8. The impact of r-process material on SN emission depends on its distribution within the ejecta. We show broadband
light curves calculated using a semianalytic method for four models that share a wind mass, total mass,56Ni mass, and kinetic
energy (equal to 0 .36M⊙, 4.0M⊙, 0.25M⊙, and 6 .2×1051erg, respectively), but have different levels of mixing due to their
differing wind durations. The upper panels show light curves assuming the wind is composed purely of r-process elements. For
comparison, we show in the lower panels a variation on each model, which assumes the wind material is non-radioactive and
has the same opacity as ordinary56Ni-free SN ejecta ( κ= 0.05 cm2g−1). The light curves of the r-process-enriched models
resemble those of the r-process-free variants for τw≤3R0/c, corresponding to a mixing parameter ζ≤0.036.
longer τware required to achieve the same level of mix-
ing. However, relaxing the assumption that vw= 0.1c
also enables new inferences.
In particular, Fig. 10 shows that if explosions with
typical SNe Ic-BL masses and kinetic energies are pow-
ered exclusively by a disk wind ( E0= 0; pink curve),
and that disk wind is composed of freshly synthesized r-
process elements, the mixing will be extensive enough to
impact the SNe signal as long as τw≳2R0/c, regardless
of the wind mass. The stripped-envelope stellar progen-
itors believed to end their lives as SNe Ic-BL have pre-
explosion radii comparable to R⊙; for such stars, 2 R0/c
corresponds to a wind timescale of 1 s ≲τw≲10 s.
If we assume that GRB durations are rough indicators
of accretion disk (and therefore wind) lifetimes, we con-
clude that τwcomfortably exceeds the critical value in
all but the shortest-duration long GRBs. This implies
either that typical SNe Ic-BL derive their energy from
a source other than (or in addition to) a disk wind, or
that the disk winds that power SNe Ic-BL are not com-posed of heavy r-process material with uniquely high
opacities.‡
5.CONCLUSION
We used two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
to study mixing processes in SNe that feature a disk
wind either as their exclusive kinetic energy source or
in addition to an initial explosion. If r-process-rich disk
outflows are a near-universal component of GRB-SNe
and/or SNe Ic-BL, as proposed by the collapsa R-process
theory, characterizing disk-ejecta mixing is essential for
understanding the impact of r-process pollution on SN
signals.
We modeled wind-enhanced SN explosions using four
parameters, and discovered that mixing increases with
wind mass ( Mw) and duration ( τw) and decreases with
the initial explosion energy ( E0). We derived a straight-
‡An additional question that arises for wind-driven rCCSNe
is the origin of56Ni, which for E0= 0 cannot be attributed to a
prompt explosion. While nucleosynthesis is not our current focus,
we note that some authors (e.g., Maeda & Tominaga 2009) have
found that56Ni-burning may occur in stellar gas outside the disk
when it is shocked by outflowing winds.12 Barnes & Duffell

sion at the expense of optical flux. We show how the pre-
dicted r−Kscolor changes for models with M0= 3.64M⊙,
Mw= 0.36M⊙,Ek= 6.2×1051erg, and various values of

than ordinary stellar material. (In other words, we show the

forward and physically motivated way to quantify these
dependencies (Eq. 7). Intriguingly, the sensitivity of
mixing to τwdecouples mixing from the wind mass and
energy; a range of outcomes is possible at any given Mw
andEk. The effect of the fourth parameter, t0,w(the
start time of the wind relative to the initial explosion),
is minor compared to the impact of the other three vari-
ables.
Having simulated the explosions of rCCSNe with disk
winds, we next used semianalytic radiation transport to
understand how the density and mixing profiles of these
SNe affect their electromagnetic emission. We focused
on SNe with ejecta masses, velocities, and56Ni masses
typical of SNe Ic-BL, and discovered that only fairly
high levels of mixing appreciably altered the emission
relative to cases with r-process-free winds. Given that
one way to achieve this degree of mixing is through an
extended wind duration, this finding identifies SNe as-
sociated with longer long GRBs as ideal targets in the
search for rCCSNe.
Extrapolating the trends we observed in our survey
of the Mw-E0-τwparameter space allowed us to argue
that typical SNe Ic-BL are not likely to be both wind-
driven and r-process enriched. If they were, their emis-
sion would exhibit reddening inconsistent with observa-
tions. Thus, if the collapsa R-process hypothesis holds,
we cannot appeal to high-velocity disk winds to account

that yield ζ= 0.09 (a value that indicates extensive mixing
and adulteration of the SN signal) for a SN with Mej=
4.0M⊙andEk= 8×1051erg, for various initial explosion
energies E0. In contrast to earlier sections, we now allow the
wind velocity to vary. Of particular interest are wind-driven
SNe ( E0= 0; pink curve). To achieve the specified Ek, wind-
driven models must have massive and/or high-velocity winds
that cause high levels of mixing even at fairly low τw.
for the anomalously high Ekinferred for GRB-SNe and
SNe Ic-BL. On the other hand, if56Ni is synthesized in
the wind (Pruet et al. 2003; Nagataki et al. 2006; Maeda
& Tominaga 2009), a wind-driven explosion could natu-
rally explain the extensive56Ni-mixing inferred for SNe
Ic-BL (Taddia et al. 2019).
While this work has uncovered important relation-
ships between explosion parameters, wind-ejecta mix-
ing, and SN emission, uncertainties remain. In partic-
ular, the SN signal depends on the distribution of56Ni
within the ejecta, a sensitivity we neglected here. Future
work should incorporate nuclear network calculations to
model the production and subsequent mixing of56Ni in
the SN ejecta. Additional avenues for exploration in-
clude the role of the GRB jet in hydrodynamic mixing
and the effect of the progenitor structure on the trends
we discovered. The latter may be of particular inter-
est as recent observational evidence (Taddia et al. 2019)
suggests that both single and binary stripped stars can
evolve to GRB SNe and SNe Ic-BL. These two classes
can have very different pre-explosion radii (e.g. Laplace
et al. 2021; Schneider et al. 2021), which necessarily im-
pacts the mapping from GRB durations to cτw/R0.Collapsar wind mixing 13
The site(s) of r-process production remains a topic of
active investigation. Our understanding of astrophysical
heavy-element production is likely to expand in the near
future as the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave
detector network identifies new NSMs and as new instru-
ments (e.g., NIRSpec aboard JWST ) provide unprece-
dented opportunities to probe the reddest emission from
all candidate r-process production sites. Constructing
realistic models of r-process mixing in rCCSNe is crit-
ical for leveraging these capabilities, assessing the col-lapsa R-process hypothesis, and unravelling the question
ofr-process origins.
