Abstract. One of the main goals of region-based theories of space is to f or-
mulate a geometrically appealing deﬁnition of points . The paper is devoted to
the analysis of two such seminal deﬁnitions: Alfred N. White head’s ( 1929 ) and
Andrzej Grzegorczyk’s ( 1960 ). Relying on the work of Loredana Biacino’s and
Ginagiacomo Gerla’s ( 1996 ), we improve their results, solve some open prob-
lems concerning the mutual relationship between Whitehead and Grzegorczyk
points, and put forward open problems for future investigat ion.

Introduction
Alfred N. Whitehead ( 1929) was one of the ﬁrst thinkers who—following ideas
to be found in the seminal paper of de Laguna (1922)—proposed a geometrically
appealing deﬁnition of point in terms of regions of space and the contact relation.
His construction was inventive and elegant yet lacked mathe matical rigor. In the
1960s, the Polish logician Andrzej Grzegorczyk put forward one of the ﬁrst math-
ematically satisfactory systems of region-based topology , in which he formulated a
diﬀerent, yet also geometrically motivated, construction of points. The compari-
son of the two approaches was carried out by Loredana Biacino and Giangiacomo
Gerla ( 1996), who—under some reasonable assumptions—demonstrated th at the
two notions of point coincide.
The seminal paper by Biacino and Gerla (1996) is the foundation for our work.
The two main results of the paper were Theorems 5.1 and 5.3. Th e former es-
tablishes that every Grzegorczyk representative of a point is a Whitehead repre-
sentative; the latter shows that the reverse inclusion hold s for those Whitehead
representatives that can be represented by countable famil ies of regions.
To prove the ﬁrst inclusion Biacino and Gerla work with the se cond-order theory
of Grzegorczyk’s ( 1960). We show that the speciﬁc axioms can be eliminated in
favour of the standard ﬁrst-order mereotopological postul ates. Moreover, we prove
that the second-order monadic statement ‘every Grzegorczy k representative is a
Whitehead representative’ is equivalent (in the subclass o f Boolean weak contact
algebras in the sense of Düntsch and Winter (2006) in which every region has a
non-tangential part) to the ﬁrst-order statement ‘there ar e no atoms’ . For the !!!
completeness of presentation we show that no part of this equ ivalence holds in the
(general) class of Boolean weak contact algebras.
As for the second inclusion, we identify a gap in the proof of T heorem 5.3,
and we show that it cannot be carried out without assuming an a dditional ax-
iom postulating coherence, a mereotopological counterpar t of the connectedness
property. We also improve the original result by addressing an open problem
12 RAFAŁ GRUSZCZYŃSKI, SANTIAGO JOCKWICH MARTINEZ
from ( Biacino and Gerla ,1996). That is, we show that the countability assump-
tion about Whitehead representatives can be eliminated, if we assume a stronger
second-order version of the standard mereotopological int erpolation axiom.
Moreover, we prove that in complete structures, purely mere ological notions are
too weak to guarantee the existence of Whitehead representa tives of points. The
English logician himself envisaged this, but no general pro of of this fact exists in
the literature so far.1
We also provide various examples of Whitehead points within algebraic struc-
tures. This provides evidence for the claim that Whitehead p oints are mathemati-
cally tractable.
More or less from the beginning of the 21st century, Boolean c ontact algebras (see
e.g., Stell,2000;Bennett and Düntsch ,2007) have provided the standard mathe-
matical framework for doing region-based topology. This is a comfortable situation
that allows for the uniﬁcation and comparison of diﬀerent ap proaches to point-free
theories of space. For this reason, in this paper, we also use the aforementioned
algebras. This approach is diﬀerent from the original appro aches of Whitehead and
Grzegorczyk, as the former used a contact relation as the only primitive, and the
latter worked in mereology (the theory of the part of relation) extended with con-
tact. From a technical point of view, these diﬀerences are ir relevant. At the same
time, the uniﬁed well-established environment of Boolean c ontact algebras allows
for a precise and clear presentation of both approaches to re gion-based theories.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 1, we review some preliminaries
and introduce the main objects of study, viz., Boolean (weak ) contact algebras. In
Section 2, we present two formal accounts of Grzegorczyk points, i.e. , Grzegorczyk
points deﬁned in terms of equivalences classes and Grzegorc zyk points understood
as ﬁlters. Moreover, we show that these two deﬁnitions are eq uivalent in the con-
text of Boolean weak contact algebras. Sections 3addresses a formal account of
Whitehead points. We study some of their properties and prov ide examples of such
points within regular open algebras. This section witnesse s as well a proof of the
insuﬃciency of purely mereological notions for the existen ce of Whitehead points.
Section 4studies the minimal constraints that a Boolean Weak Contact Algebras
has to satisfy to guarantee that every Grzegorczyk represen tative of a point is a
Whitehead representative. In particular, in this section w e strengthen Theorem 5.1
ofBiacino and Gerla (1996). In Section 5we ﬁll the mentioned gap in the original
proof of Theorem 5.3 of Biacino and Gerla (1996) and study the logical status of
the second-order condition ‘every Whitehead representati ve is a Grzegorczyk rep-
resentative’ . In Section 6, we generalize Theorem 5.3 to Whitehead points of any
size.
1.Weak-contact and contact algebras
As usual,¬,∧,∨,−→,←→,∀and∃denote the standard logical constants
of negation, conjunction, disjunction, material implicat ion, material equivalence,
universal and the existential quantiﬁer. We use ‘ ∄’ as an abbreviation for ‘ ¬∃’ .
Moreover, :←→ means equivalent by deﬁnition , and := means equal by deﬁnition .
We use ωto denote the set of natural numbers understood as von Neuman n ordinals.
For a ﬁxed space Xandx⊆X,∁x:=X\xis the set-theoretical complement of x
inX.|X|is the cardinal number of a set X, andP(X) is its power set.
Moreover, let:
B=/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tB,·,+,−,0,1/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht
be a Boolean algebra (BA for short) with the operations of, re spectively, meet, join,
and boolean complement; and with the two distinguished elem ents: the minimum
1We elaborate on this further on p. 11.GRZEGORCZYK AND WHITEHEAD POINTS: THE STORY CONTINUES 3
0and the maximum 1. Elements of the domain will be called regions . The class of
all Boolean algebras will be denoted by ‘ BA’ . We will often refer to the domain of
BA via its name ‘ B’ . Notice that this convention will not lead to any ambiguiti es.
InBwe deﬁne two standard order relations:
x≤y:←→ x·y=x , (df≤)
x < y :←→ x≤y∧x/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=y . (df<)
In the former case we say that xispart ofyor that xisbelow y, in the latter that
xisproper part ofyor that xisstrictly below y.
Any Boolean algebra Bis turned into a Boolean contact algebra (BCA for short)
by extending it to a structure /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tB,·,+,−,0,1,C/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htwhere C⊆B2is acontact relation
which satisﬁes the following ﬁve axioms:
¬(0 Cx), (C0)
x≤y∧x/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0−→xCy, (C1)
xCy−→yCx, (C2)
x≤y−→∀ z∈B(zCx−→zCy), (C3)
xC(y+z)−→xCy∨xCz . (C4)
The complement of Cwill be denoted by ‘ C/’, and in the case xC/ywe say that
xisseparated from y. The class of all Boolean contact algebras will be denoted
by ‘BCA ’ . IfCsatisﬁes ( C0)–(C3), it is called—after Düntsch and Winter (2006)—
aweak contact relation and the corresponding structure bears the name of a Boolean
weak contact algebra (BWCA for short). The class of all weak contact algeb ras will
be denoted by ‘ BWCA ’ .
We introduce the convention according to which given a class Kof structures
and some conditions ϕ1, . . . , ϕ nput upon elements of K,K+ϕ1+. . .+ϕn(orK+
{ϕ1, . . . , ϕ n}) is the subclass of Kin which every structure satisﬁes all ϕ1, . . . , ϕ n,
e.g.,
BCA =BWCA + (C4).
InB∈BWCA we deﬁne an auxiliary relation of non-tangential inclusion (or
way below ,well-inside ) relation:
(df≪) x≪y:←→ xC/−y .
We also deﬁne x/medcircleyto mean that x·y/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0, and take⊥⊆B×Bto be the
set-theoretical complement of /medcircle. In the former case we say that xoverlaps y,
in the latter, that xis disjoint from yorxis incompatible with y. A structure
/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tB,·,+,−,0,1,/medcircle/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htis a standard example of a BCA.2The most well-known inter-
pretation of contact is the topological one. For a ﬁxed space /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tX,O/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htwe take the
underlying algebra to be either the complete algebra RO( X) of all regular open
subsets of X, or its subalgebra B. The Boolean operations3are:
x·y:=x∩y
x+y:= Int Cl( x∪y)
−x:= Int∁x
and the contact relation is given by:
xCTy:←→ Clx∩Cly/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=∅.
2The overlap relation is actually the smallest contact relat ion on a BCA, see
(Düntsch and Winter ,2004 ).
3Int and Cl are the standard topological interior andclosure operators.4 RAFAŁ GRUSZCZYŃSKI, SANTIAGO JOCKWICH MARTINEZ
Moreover, we have:
x≪Ty←→ Clx⊆y .
The relation CTsatisﬁes axioms ( C0)–(C4), so any topological contact algebra is
in the class BCA .
We may use a similar interpretation on the whole power set alg ebra of X, i.e.,
/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tP(X),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htis a Boolean contact algebra (provided Xis equipped with a topology,
of course). Observe that despite the algebra being atomic, t he contact relation does
not collapse to the overlap relation. For example, in the cas e ofRwith the standard
topology, the open intervals (0 ,1) and (1 ,2) are disjoint, yet they are in contact
since their closures share an atom. However, we may look upon CTas a form of an
overlap relation since in this special case of the power set a lgebra, we have:
xCTy←→ Clx/medcircleCly ,
which usually is not true when we take into account regular op en algebras. From
this, it follows that closed sets are in contact only if they o verlap, and thus the
contact between atoms reduces to identity, if the underlyin g topology is T1.
The following facts are standardly proven to hold in BWCA :
x≪y−→x≤y , (1.1)
x≪y∧y≪x−→x=y , (1.2)
x≪y∧y≤z−→x≪z , (1.3)
x≤y∧y≪z−→x≪z , (1.4)
x≪y∧y≪z−→x≪z , (1.5)
x≪y←→− y≪−x . (1.6)
Deﬁnition 1. Anatom of a Boolean (contact) algebra is a non-zero region xthat
is minimal with respect to ≤among non-zero regions. A BWCA is atomic iﬀ its
underlying BA is atomic iﬀ every non-zero region contains an atom. A BWCA is
atomless iﬀ it does not have any atoms, i.e., satisﬁes the following co ndition:
(∄At) ( ∀x∈B\{0})(∃y∈B\{0})y < x .
⊣
2.Grzegorczyk points
AGrzegorczyk representative of a point (for short: G-representative )4inB∈
BWCA is a non-empty set Qof regions such that:
0/∈Q , (r0)
(∀u, v∈Q)(u=v∨u≪v∨v≪u), (r1)
(∀u∈Q)(∃v∈Q)v≪u , (r2)
(∀x, y∈B)/parenleftbig
(∀u∈Q)(u/medcirclex∧u/medcircley)−→xCy/parenrightbig
. (r3)
LetQGbe the set of all G-representatives of B. The purpose of the deﬁnition is to
formally grasp the intuition of a point as a system of diminis hing regions determin-
ing a unique location in space. We call it a representative , since if we understand
a point as a perfect representation of a location in space, th en two diﬀerent sets of
regions may represent the same location (see Figure 1for a geometrical intuition
on the Cartesian plane). Further, we will identify such G-re presentatives to be one
point. Although the deﬁnition has a strong geometrical ﬂavo r, G-representatives

Q1
Q2
Figure 1. Q1and Q2representing the same location in two-
dimensional Euclidean space
may be somewhat strange entities in BCAs that have little to d o with spatial in-
tuitions. We will look at some indicative examples. But ﬁrst , let us go through an
example of a G-representative in a well-known setting: the r eals.
Example 1.Take the real line Rwith the Euclidean topology. It is a standard
result that the pair /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(R),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht, where RO( R) is the complete algebra of regular
open subsets of RandCTis the standard topological interpretation of contact (as
deﬁned above) is a Boolean contact algebra.
Take 0∈R. Obviously, the set:
{(−1/n,1/n)|n∈ω\{0}}
is a G-representative. But also:
{(−1/n,1/n)|n∈O}
where O⊆ωis the set of odd numbers, and
{(−1/r,1/r)|ris a positive irrational }
are G-representatives standing for the same location in the one-dimensional space,
i.e., number 0. Moreover, one can easily see that there are un countably many such
G-representatives.5⊣
Deﬁnition 2. IfX, Y are subsets of a BWCA, then Ycovers X(orXiscovered by
Y) iﬀ for every y∈Ythere is x∈Xsuch that x≤y. We write ‘ X/trianglerightequalY’ meaning
Xcovers Y, and ‘ X/triangleleftequalY’ meaning Xis covered by Y. Let/nottriangeqlleftbe the set-theoretical
complement of /triangleleftequal.
For a region xof a BWCA, let↓x:={y∈B|y≤x}, i.e.,↓xis the set of all
parts of x. ⊣
The general fact that diﬀerent G-representatives can repre sent the same location
in space follows also from:
Lemma 2.1. (Gruszczyński and Pietruszczak ,2018b , Lemma 5.6) IfQis a G-
representative in B∈BWCA , then every subset of Qcovered by Qis also a G-
representative. In particular, for any region x,Q∩↓xis a G-representative, pro-
vided Q∩↓x/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=∅.
In light of the above, to speak about points we need to be able t o identify diﬀerent
G-representatives which stand for the same locus.
5The reader interested in philosophical issues related to Gr zegorczyk points is asked to con-
sult ( Gruszczyński and Pietruszczak ,2009 ).6 RAFAŁ GRUSZCZYŃSKI, SANTIAGO JOCKWICH MARTINEZ
2.1.Grzegorczyk points as quotients. Let us begin with the deﬁnition:
(df
և)
ևx:={y∈B|y≪x}
and two lemmas.
Lemma 2.2. IfQ1andQ2are G-representatives in B∈BWCA , then :
(∀x∈Q1)(∀y∈Q2)xCy iﬀ Q2/triangleleftequalQ1.
Proof. (i) Assume that Q2is not covered by Q1, i.e., there is x1∈Q1such that
for every y∈Q2,y−x1/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0.6By (r2), there is x0∈Q1∩
ևx1(i.e., by deﬁnition
of≪we have x0C/−x1). Observe that for every z, y∈Q2,z/medcircley−x1. Indeed, if
z, y∈Q2, we have that either (a) z≤yor (b) y≤z. If (a) holds, z−x1≤zand
z−x1≤y−x1. If (b) holds, y−x1≤z. If (∀z∈Q2)z/medcirclex0, then by ( r3) we
obtain that x0Cy−x1, a contradiction. So there is z0∈Q2such that z0⊥x0.
By (r2) again there is z1∈Q2∩
ևz0, soz1C/x0.
(ii) Suppose there are x∈Q1andy∈Q2such that xC/y, but Q2/triangleleftequalQ1. Take
z∈Q2∩↓x. Ifz≤y, then y/medcirclex, and if y≤z, then y≤x, a contradiction, as
x⊥yby the fact that/medcircle⊆C, which is easily veriﬁed. /square
In consequence we have:
Corollary 2.3. LetB∈BWCA . IfQ1andQ2are G-representatives and Q1/triangleleftequalQ2,
then Q2/triangleleftequalQ1.
Theorem 2.4. IfB∈BWCA , then/triangleleftequalis an equivalence relation on the set of
G-representatives.
Proof. The symmetry of /triangleleftequalholds by Corollary 2.3. The reﬂexivity and transitivity
of/triangleleftequalfollow from the reﬂexivity and transitivity of ≤. /square
We are now in a position to say precisely that G-representati vesQ1andQ2
represent the same location if and only if Q1is covered by Q2andQ2is covered by
Q1. Therefore, it is reasonable to deﬁne points as equivalence classes of /triangleleftequalon the
set of all G-representatives QG(to emphasize the fact that Q1andQ2represent the
same location, i.e., are mutually covered by each another, w e will write ‘ Q1∼Q2’):
Eq:=QG/∼.
For any two sets of regions XandYsuch that Xcovers YandYcovers X, we
will say that XandYarecoinitial .
2.2.Grzegorczyk points as ﬁlters. The second (chronologically the ﬁrst) idea—
used by Grzegorczyk (1960)—is to deﬁne points as ﬁlters that are generated by
G-representatives:
Fis a point iﬀ (∃Q∈QG)F={x∈B|(∃q∈Q)q≤x}.
By ‘FQ’, we will denote a point generated by the G-representative Q. These ﬁlters
will be called G-points , and the set of all G-points will be denoted by ‘ Grz’, while
its elements by small fraktur letters ‘ p’, ‘q’ and ‘r’, indexed if necessary. For every
G-point FQwe have:
(2.1) x∈FQ←→ (∃y∈Q)y≪x←→ (∃y∈Q)y≤x .
Observe that for Q1, Q2∈QG:
(2.2) Q1∼Q2←→ (∃p∈Grz)Q1∪Q2⊆p.
6‘x−y’ abbreviates ‘ x·−y’ .GRZEGORCZYK AND WHITEHEAD POINTS: THE STORY CONTINUES 7
Proof. (−→) This follows from Corollary 2.3, the deﬁnition of G-points and ( 2.1).
(←) Let X=FQ. Since both Q1andQ2are subsets of FQ, they must be
coinitial with Q, and so Q1∼Q2. /square
Thus, as we see, by considering points as ﬁlters we can recove r the equivalence re-
lation between G-representatives. The reverse transition —from equivalence classes
to ﬁlters—is obvious, since for a given class [ Q]∼it is enough to take FQ.
Let us conclude this section with an observation that there i s a 1–1 correspon-
dence between G-points as equivalence classes and G-points as ﬁlters:
Lemma 2.5. LetB∈BWCA . The function f:Eq→Grz such that f([Q]∼) :=
FQis a bijection.
Proof. If [Q1]/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh= [Q2], then Q1/nottriangeqlleftQ2. Therefore, by Lemma 2.2(i) there are x∈Q1
andy∈Q2such that x⊥y. SoFQ1/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=FQ2, since otherwise both xandyare in
the same ﬁlter. Surjectivity is obvious, since every G-poin t is a ﬁlter FQ, for some
G-representative Q. /square
3.Whitehead points
In this section, we present a mathematical analysis of (a rep resentative of) a
point as formulated by Whitehead (1929), and then used by Biacino and Gerla
(1996). Roughly, the idea is that Whitehead points are minimal ele ments of a
poset of abstractive sets of a Boolean weak contact algebra.7
We begin with the crucial deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 3. A set of regions Aof a BWCA is an abstractive set iﬀ it satisﬁes
(r0), (r1) and:
(A) ( ∄x∈B)(∀y∈A)x≤y .
The class of all abstractive sets of a given BWCA is denoted by ‘A’ . Since by ( r1)
and ( 1.1) every abstractive set is a chain w.r.t. ≤, it must be the case that for every
x∈Athere is y∈Asuch that y < x . So, by the Axiom of Dependent Choices,
every abstractive set is inﬁnite. ⊣
The idea behind the deﬁnition is that we can abstract geometr ical objects—like
lines, segments, and points—from other entities. However, unlike representatives of
Grzegorczyk’s, these entities do not have to represent poin ts but might be planes,
straight lines, line segments, triangles, and so on. To use a simple example, we take
the algebra RO( R2) and the family of regular open sets of the form:
{/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tx, y/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht|y∈(−1/n,1/n)}forn∈ω\{0},
which is an abstractive set that represents the straight lin ey= 0 (i.e., some object
from beyond the domain RO( R2)). Of course, we easily see that it is not a G-
representative, since regions:
{/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tx, y/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht|x/greaterorequalslant1∧y∈(−1,1)}and{/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tx, y/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht|x/lessorequalslant−1∧y∈(−1,1)}
overlap all regions from the abstractive set, but are not in c ontact (in the sense of
CTfor the algebra RO( R2)). So the set violates ( r3).
We use the same terminology and symbols for the covering relation between
abstractive sets that has been introduced for Grzegorczyk r epresentatives. In par-
ticular, recall that AandBare coinitial in the case where Ais covered by Band
Bis covered by A.
7More about the philosophy of and motivations for Whitehead p oints can be found in two
excellent papers by Gerla (2020 ) and Varzi (2020 ).8 RAFAŁ GRUSZCZYŃSKI, SANTIAGO JOCKWICH MARTINEZ
Unlike in the case of covering relation on G-representative s, covering on abstrac-
tive sets does not have to be an equivalence relation since it is not—in general—
symmetric. However, it is reﬂexive and transitive, so the co initiality on abstractive
sets is an equivalence relation. Following Whitehead, we wi ll call every element of
A/∼ageometrical element . Given A∈Aits equivalence class w.r.t. ∼will be
denoted by ‘[ A]’ . If A1, A2∈A, deﬁne a binary relation on A/∼:
[A1]/precedesequ⊣l[A2] :←→ A1/triangleleftequalA2.
The relation/precedesequ⊣lis clearly a partial order. Moreover, A1∼A2andB1∼B2together
entail that: A1/triangleleftequalB1iﬀA2/triangleleftequalB2, thus/precedesequ⊣lis well-deﬁned.
Deﬁnition 4. ForA∈A, [A] is a Whitehead point (W-point ) iﬀ [ A] is minimal
in/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tA/∼,/precedesequ⊣l/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht. The set of all Whitehead points will be denoted by ‘ W’ .A∈Ais a
W-representative of a point iﬀ [ A]∈W. Let QWbe the set of all W-representatives
of a given BWCA. ⊣
Alternatively, for an abstractive set Awe have:
(3.1) A∈QW←→∀ B∈A(B/triangleleftequalA−→A/triangleleftequalB).
Recall that a BWCA is atomic iﬀ its underlying BA is atomic iﬀ every non-
zero region contains an atom (i.e., an element that is minima l w.r.t. the standard
Boolean order). As an immediate consequence of the deﬁnitio n of an abstractive
set we get the following:
Corollary 3.1. IfB∈BWCA is atomic, then Bdoes not have any abstractive
sets, more so it does not have W-representatives.
3.1.W-representatives in regular open algebras. If RO( X) is a regular open
algebra and Ais its W-representative, then of course/logicalandtextA=0. However, this does
not exclude the possibility in which/intersectiontextA/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=∅, as/logicalandtextA= Int/intersectiontextA. Thus we may ask
about set-theoretical intersections of abstractive sets.
Lemma 3.2. IfXis a topological space, and /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(X),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htis its topological contact
algebra, then for every abstractive set A⊆RO(X),/intersectiontextAis closed. Therefore if/intersectiontextA/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=∅and/intersectiontextA∈RO(X), then the space Xis disconnected.
Proof. Fix an abstractive set Awhose elements are from a /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(X),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht. According
to the characterization of ≪T,Aand Cl[ A] ={Cla|a∈A}are coinitial. Indeed,
ifa∈A, then by ( r2) there is b∈Asuch that b≪Ta, i.e., Cl b⊆a. So Acovers
Cl[A]. The other direction is obvious since a⊆Cla. Thus,/intersectiontextA=/intersectiontextCl[A], and in
consequence/intersectiontextAis closed in X.
Since the inﬁma in RO( X) are given by the interiors of the intersections, if Xis
connected,/intersectiontextAis never an element of the algebra if non-empty. /square
This lemma gives rise to a philosophical interpretation of a bstractive sets. If
the underlying regular algebra is composed of sets that are m odels of objects from
the physical space (spatial bodies), it usually is a sub-alg ebra of RO( Rn), where
Rnis given the standard topology. Various choices are possibl e8, yet irrespective
of these for no abstractive set A⊆RO(Rn),/intersectiontextA/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=∅. In this sense abstractive
sets represent objects from beyond the universe of models of spatial bodies, i.e.,
serve as abstraction processes to introduce objects that ma y be called geometrical ,
ideal or, precisely, abstract . These objects are, of course, elements of the power set
algebra of Rn, but the idea is that there are «too many» objects in P(Rn) from
the perspective of the physical space, yet some of the elemen ts ofP(Rn) can be

treated as approximations made via elements of subalgebras of the regular open
algebra of Rn.
The deﬁnition of a W-representative from the point of view of Euclidean spaces
seems to be neat and grasp a certain way in which we may abstrac t points as higher-
order objects. However, in the sequel, we will point to «stra nge» examples. But
ﬁrst, we prove that there are contact algebras that have W-po ints. Their existence
stems from the following:
Theorem 3.3. Let/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tX,O/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htbe a topological space. If Ais an abstractive set in
/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(X),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htthat is at the same time a local basis at a point p∈X, then Ais a
W-representative.
Proof. Suppose Ais an abstractive set in /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(X),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htand a local basis at p. Let
B⊆RO(X) be an abstractive set such that B/triangleleftequalA. We show that p∈/intersectiontextB.
Suppose otherwise, i.e., let b0∈Bbe such that p /∈b0. Since Bis an abstractive
set it follows that there exists a b1∈Bsuch that b1≪Tb0i.e., Cl b1⊆b0and thus
p /∈Clb1. Therefore, we have p∈X\Clb1, where X\Clb1is an open set in O.
It follows that there exists an a∈Asuch that a≤X\Clb1andp∈a. Hence,
a·b1=0. In consequence, there exists no b∈Bsuch that b≤a, which contradicts
our initial assumption that Acovers B.
Since p∈/intersectiontextBandAis a local basis at p, we know that for every b∈Bthere
exists an a∈Asuch that a⊆b, soAmust be covered by B. Thus, Ais a W-
representative. /square
In consequence we have:
Corollary 3.4. The real line with the standard topology has a W-representat ive at
every point of the space.
Deﬁnition 5 (Davis ,1978).Alob-space is a topological space that at every of its
point has a local basis linearly ordered by the subset relati on. ⊣
Deﬁnition 6 (Gruszczyński ,2016).A topological space Xisconcentric iﬀ it is T1
and at every p∈Xthere is a local basis Bpsuch that:
⊣ (R1) (∀U, V∈Bp) (U=V∨ClU⊆V∨ClV⊆U).
Thus, concentric spaces are those T1-spaces whose all points have local bases
that satisfy the topological version of ( r1) condition for G-representatives. The
theorem below demonstrates that these are a subclass of Davi es’s lob-spaces.
Theorem 3.5 (Gruszczyński and Pietruszczak ,2021).A topological space Xis
concentric iﬀ it is a regular lob-space.
Theorem 3.6. IfXis a concentric space whose regular open algebra is atomless ,
then at every point there is a local basis that is a W-represen tative.
Proof. Since Xis regular, it is also semi-regular, so RO( X) is its basis, which is
atomless by assumption. Therefore, the local basis at any po intpthat satisﬁes
(R1) must be an abstractive set. So by Theorem 3.3the basis must be a W-
representative. /square
Moreover, we have the following result regarding W-represe ntatives, which shows
that in the case of topological interpretation, they repres ent «small» chunks of the
underlying space.
Lemma 3.7. IfXis a regular topological space, and /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(X),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htis its topological
contact algebra, then for every W-representative A⊆RO(X),/intersectiontextAis a nowhere
dense subset of X.9
9The observation and the proof that/intersectiontext
Ais nowhere dense is due to Hart (2023 ).10 RAFAŁ GRUSZCZYŃSKI, SANTIAGO JOCKWICH MARTINEZ
Proof. Assume that x:=/intersectiontextAhas a non-empty interior. Therefore, there is a non-
empty regular open set ysuch that Cl y⊆Intx. This in particular means that
y≪Ta, for all a∈A. Since the space is regular and the algebra atomless, we
can construct a sequence such that y0:=yandyn+1≪Tyn. In consequence for
Y:={yn|n∈ω}we have that Acovers A∪Ybut not vice versa, since no element
ofYcontains an element of A. So Ais not a W-representative. /square
What is common for all W-representatives whose existence fo llows from the above
result is that although they do not have inﬁma as subsets for r egular open algebras,
they do have a non-empty intersection that is precisely the p oint of the space that
they represent as a basis. This raises the question whether t here is a regular open
algebra that has a W-representative whose set-theoretical intersection is non-empty
and that may be interpreted as a «new» point, i.e., something similar to a free
ultraﬁlter being treated as a point of a topological space. T he answer is positive,
and the example is due to Klaas Pieter Hart.
Example 2 (Hart,2023).Consider the ordinal space X:= [0 , ω1), where ω1is the
ﬁrst uncountable ordinal. Recall that if xandyare closed and unbounded subsets
ofX, then x∩y/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=∅. Due to this, for any open subsets xandyofX, if Cl x⊆y,
then either Cl xis compact or ycontains an interval [ α+ 1, ω1), for some α < ω 1.
For if Cl xis not compact, then it must be unbounded, and since Cl x∩∁y=∅,∁y
is bounded, i.e., there is α < ω 1such that ∁y⊆[0, α]. Therefore [ α+ 1, ω1)⊆y.
The following set A:={[α+ 1, ω1)|α < ω 1}consists of clopen—and the more so
regular open—subsets of X, and is an abstractive set. If Bis also an abstractive
set such that Acovers B, then every element b∈Bmust be unbounded. The more
so the closure of every element of Bis unbounded, and since for every b∈Bthere
isb0inBsuch that Cl b0⊆b,bmust contain an interval [ α+ 1, ω). Thus Bcovers
A, and so Ais a W-representative in RO( X). Of course,/intersectiontextA=∅, and the W-point
[A] represents the ordinal ω1that is absent from X. ⊣
This example is quite important from the point of view of the h idden assumptions
behind Whitehead points. Bostock (2009, p. 30) writes that:
[. . . ] Whitehead’s construction [. . . ] does actually have th e idea
of boundedness built into it: only a bounded nest10can satisfy
Whitehead’s deﬁnition of a point-nest. (But I do not suppose that
Whitehead recognised this.)
What the example shows then is that boundedness is not built i nto the idea of
Whitehead points. It only is as far as «natural» spaces—like Euclidean spaces—are
considered, which follows from further results and propert ies of Grzegorczyk points
proven in ( Gruszczyński ,2016;Gruszczyński and Pietruszczak ,2018b ,2019). In
an abstract setting, relevant for this paper, the notion of boundedness does not
have to be considered, as Hart’s example shows. Also, this example shows that
theconnectedness of regions that constitute W-representatives is not built i nto
the general idea of points in the sense of Whitehead, as every region in the W-
representative from the example is topologically disconne cted.11
Let us make another philosophical remark at this point. It ma y also be the case
that we do not know whether a particular subset of a regular op en algebra is a
W-representative due to our current state of knowledge. Con sider the following
example.
10A nest is the counterpart of an abstractive set, it is bounded if it contains only bounded
regions (actually it is enough that it contains one such regi on to be considered bounded).
11The issue of connectedness of regions in Whitehead’s theory is elaborately discussed in
(Bostock ,2009 ).GRZEGORCZYK AND WHITEHEAD POINTS: THE STORY CONTINUES 11

The twin prime conjecture, i.e., the claim that there exist i nﬁnitely many twin

whether Ais ﬁnite or inﬁnite. This implies that we also do not know whet herAis
an abstractive set and thus a W-representative. ⊣
Observe that there are BCAs without any W-representatives a nd, therefore,
without any Whitehead points.

Lemma 3.8. No complete B∈BCA in which C=/medcirclehas W-representatives.12

have W-representatives.
So suppose Bis inﬁnite, and let /⊣\}br⊣cketle{txα|α < κ/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htbe an abstractive set, for some
limit cardinal κ. Since we consider the case in which contact is overlap, we ha ve
that:
x0> x 1> . . . > x n> x n+1> . . . > x β> x β+1> . . .
is an abstractive set. For any α < κ deﬁne: yα:=xα−xα+1and consider the

representative. In consequence, no abstractive set is a Whi tehead representative.

Let us round oﬀ this section with the following remarks. Lemm a3.8is a math-
ematical embodiment of what Whitehead (1920) discovered himself: the purely
mereological notion of parthood is too weak to represent his concept of point as
a collection of regions. Some arguments for this can be found in Whitehead’s book,
(Bostock ,2009) and ( Varzi ,2020). However, their common weaknesses are that
(a) they refer to particular kind of regions that invoke the n otions of dimension
and of shape (either explicitly or implicitly) and (b) they do not single out precise
assumptions. These are arguments, not proofs in a strict mat hematical sense. We
present a fully-ﬂedged proof, which is general in the sense t hat we consider regions
as abstract elements of any Boolean algebra. What remains to be eliminated is the
assumption of completeness. Thus, we put forward the follow ing open problem:
Problem 1.Is there an incomplete BCA in which both C=/medcircleand there exists a
W-representative?
12If, additionally, Bis atomless, then it does not have any G-representative eith er, which is
entailed by Theorem 4.4proven further.12 RAFAŁ GRUSZCZYŃSKI, SANTIAGO JOCKWICH MARTINEZ
Observe that Lemma 3.8does not exclude such algebras, as the property of being
a W-representative does not have to be preserved for complet ions of BAs. That is,
ifBis an incomplete BA that has a W-representative A, andBis the completion
ofB, then the structure of Ais preserved by the canonical embedding e:B→B.
In consequence, we can repeat the reasoning from Lemma 3.8and show that e[A]
is not a W-representative.
4.G-representatives are W-representatives (under additional
assumptions)
In this section, we are occupied with two problems: (a) what a re the mini-
mal conditions for BWCAs that guarantee that every G-repres entative is a W-
representative, and (b) what is the content of the second ord er monadic statement
about the dependency between the two sets of representative s. Theorem 4.4below is
a stronger version of ( Biacino and Gerla ,1996, Theorem 5.1). Biacino and Gerla ’s
proof to establish that every G-representative is a W-repre sentative uses the second-
order constraints that postulate the existence of Grzegorc zyk points. These are
their axioms G 4and G 5, closely related to the original Grzegorczyk axiom from his
paper.13We prove that the original result of the Italian mathematici ans can be
substantially improved, as we only assume the axioms for the weak contact relation
plus:
(∀x/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0)(∃y/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0)y≪x , (C5)
and the atomlessness of the underlying Boolean algebra. ( C5) is known as the
non-tangential part axiom, and it is equivalent—by ( df≪)—to:
(∀x/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=1)(∃y/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0)xC/y ,
the so-called disconnection axiom. In the class BWCA both these axioms are
equivalent to the extensionality axiom:
(∀z∈B) (zCx←→ zCy)−→x=y .
Moreover, we show that in the class BWCA + (C5) the second-order monadic
statement ‘every G-representative is a W-representative’ is equivalent to the ﬁrst
order condition ‘there are no atoms’ . Additionally, in Theo rem4.5we demonstrate
that both the implications fail if we omit the axiom ( C5). Thus, via the two
theorems, we provide answers to both (a) and (b) above.
The ﬁrst requirement that G-representatives must meet to be W-representatives
is that they are abstractive sets. In general, it does not hav e to be true: there
are contact algebras with G-representatives that are not ab stractive sets since the
former do not have to satisfy ( A).Biacino and Gerla do not have to take this into
account since their deﬁnition of G-representative contain s the requirement that it
is a set of regions without the minimal element. This, howeve r, is the assumption
that is absent from the deﬁnition introduced in the original paper by Grzegorczyk .
In connection with this we have:
Proposition 4.1 (Gruszczyński and Pietruszczak ,2016).IfB∈BWCA + (C5)
andBhas an atom a, then{a}∈QG.
Proof. Fix an atom a. By ( C5) there exists a non-zero b∈Bsuch that b≪a. So
b≤aby (1.1), and thus b=a. From this, we can see that the conditions ( r0)–(r2)
are satisﬁed. For ( r3), ifx/medcircleaandy/medcirclea, then a≤xanda≤y, sox/medcircley./square
13See ( Gruszczyński and Pietruszczak ,2018a ) for a comparison of the original axiomatization
ofGrzegorczyk ’s system with the system of Biacino and Gerla ’s.GRZEGORCZYK AND WHITEHEAD POINTS: THE STORY CONTINUES 13
So, if a BWCA has atoms and satisﬁes ( C5) there are G-representatives, which
are not abstractive sets. Thus, in general, it is not the case that QG⊆A, and the
natural thought is to eliminate the existence of atoms, espe cially due to the fact
that G-points generated by atoms are—in a way—not very inter esting, similarly as
are not principal ultraﬁlters.
Before we do this, we prove a propoisition that will help us es tablish the main
results of this section.
Proposition 4.2. LetB∈BWCA .
(i) If A∈A, then Asatisﬁes the strong version of (r2):
(r2s) ( ∀x∈A)(∃y∈A) (y≪x∧y/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=x).
(ii) If Xis a set of regions such that X/triangleleftequalQfor some G-representative Q, then
Xsatisﬁes (r3).
(iii) If A∈A,Q∈QGandA/triangleleftequalQ, then A∈QGand[A]∼= [Q]∼.
Proof. (i) For every x∈Athere is a y∈Asuch that y < x . But, by ( r1), either
x≪yory≪x. Since the former cannot hold in light of ( 1.1), we have the latter.
(ii) Assume that for all x∈X,xCuandxCv. Ifq∈Q, then by covering of X
byQand by ( C3) we have that qCuandqCv. Therefore uCv, by ( r3) for Q.
(iii) Follows from the previous items (i), (ii) and Corollar y2.3. /square
Proposition 4.3. IfB∈BWCA + (C5) + (∄At), then every non-zero region of B
has two proper parts that are separated from each other.
Proof. Letxbe a non-zero element of B. Since the algebra has no atoms, there
is a non-zero ythat is a proper part of x. So, by the Boolean axioms, there is
another non-zero z < x that is incompatible with y. But by ( C5),zmust have
a non-tangential part z0. So z0C/y, and both regions are parts of x. /square
Theorem 4.4. IfB∈BWCA + (C5), thenBis atomless iﬀ in Bevery G-
representative is a W-representative.
Proof. Suppose B∈BWCA +(C5)+(∄At). Observe that if Qis a G-representative
of an algebra Bfrom the class, then Qis an abstractive set by Proposition 4.3.
Further, [ Q] is a geometrical element. Suppose A∈Ais such that [ A]∼/precedesequ⊣l[Q],
i.e.,A/triangleleftequalQ. Therefore by Proposition 4.2we have that A∈[Q], which means that
[A] = [Q], as required.
On the other hand, if B∈BWCA + (C5) andBhas an atom a, then by
Proposition 4.1,{a}∈QG. Thus QG/notsubseteqlQW. /square
The axiom ( C5) cannot be dropped, even in the class of Boolean contact alge bras,
that is:
Theorem 4.5. There is a B∈BCA +¬(C5)in which there are no atoms, and in
which QG/notsubseteqlQW; and there is also an algebra from the same class that has atom s
and in which QG⊆QW.
To prove the ﬁrst part of the theorem we provide a general meth od for construct-
ing contact algebras. Given a B∈BA, let dbe its non-zero element that we call
distinguished . By means of it, we deﬁne the following relation:
xCdy:←→ x/medcircley∨(x/medcircled∧y/medcircled).
It is routine to verify that Cdis a contact relation, i.e., satisﬁes axioms ( C0)–(C4).
Observe that the largest contact relation on B, i.e.,B+×B+, is a special case of
Cdin which d=1, or more generally, where dis adense region in B(i.e., such
that every non-zero xoverlaps it).14 RAFAŁ GRUSZCZYŃSKI, SANTIAGO JOCKWICH MARTINEZ
We have that:
x≪dy←→ x≤y∧(x≤−d∨d≤y)
←→ x≤y−d∨x+d≤y .
from which it follows immediately that:
(4.1) d≪dd.
We also have that:
Corollary 4.6. Ifx <dandx/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0, then xdoes not have any non-tangential part.
In consequence any Boolean contact algebra /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tB,Cd/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htfails to satisfy (C5).
Lemma 4.7.{d}is a G-representative of /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tB,Cd/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht, and↑{d}is its only G-point.
Proof. (r0) holds by the deﬁnition of d, (r1) and ( r2) by ( 4.1), and ( r3) by the
deﬁnition of Cd. In consequence, ↑{d}is a G-point.
Suppose there is a G-point p/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=↑{d}. By ( Gruszczyński ,2016, Fact 6.28) there
arex∈pandy≥dsuch that xC/dy, i.e., y≪d−x. Therefore either y≤−dor
d≤−x. The ﬁrst possibility is exlcuded by the fact that d/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0anddis below y.
Therefore the second one holds, and thus x≤−d. /square
Proof of the ﬁrst part of Theorem 4.5.Take any atomless Boolean algebra B, ﬁx
its distinguished element d, and expand it to the Boolean contact algebra /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tB,Cd/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht.
By Lemma 4.7, the singleton{d}is a G-representative that is ﬁnite and therefore
cannot be a W-representative. By Proposition 4.6, the algebra has regions without
non-tangential parts, so it fails to satisfy ( C5). /square
Proof of the second part of Theorem 4.5.Consider the following two contact alge-
bras,/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(R),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htand the four element Boolean algebra B4:={0, a, b, 1}with the
full contact relation C1(i.e., d:=1). Consider their product P:= RO( R)×B4as
Boolean algebras (i.e., all the operations are deﬁned coord inate-wise) but with the
contact deﬁned as:
/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tx, u/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htC/⊣\}br⊣cketle{ty, w/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht:←→ xCTy∨uC1w .
It is routine to verify that Csatisﬁes ( C0)–(C4).14We have that:
/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tx, u/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht≪/⊣\}br⊣cketle{ty, w/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht←→ x≪Ty∧u≪1w
←→ x≪Ty∧(u=0∨w=1).
The algebra has two atoms: /⊣\}br⊣cketle{t0, a/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htand/⊣\}br⊣cketle{t0, b/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht.Pdoes not satisfy ( C5), as none of
the two atoms is its own non-tangential part. In consequence , neither the singleton
of the former nor the singleton of the latter is a G-represent ative.
Observe that the set of G-representatives of Pcontains all sets of the form
Q×{0}, where Qis a G-representative of /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(R),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht. It is quite obvious that
(r0)–(r2) are satisﬁed by Q×{0}. As for ( r3), if we have pairs /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tx, u/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htand/⊣\}br⊣cketle{ty, w/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htthat
overlap every element of Q×{0}, then for all z∈Q,x/medcirclezandy/medcirclez, soxCTy,
which is enough to conclude that /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tx, u/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htC/⊣\}br⊣cketle{ty, w/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht.
The only products that are G-representatives in the algebra are sets of the form
Q×{0}, where Qis a G-representative in RO( R). Firstly, neither Q×{a}nor
Q×{b}can be G-representatives, as no element of any of the two sets has a
non-tangential part. Secondly, any set of the form Q×{1}, where Qis a G-
representative in RO( R), fails to satisfy ( r3). To see this, take any regular open
setxthat overlaps every element of Qand consider pairs /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tx,0/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htand/⊣\}br⊣cketle{t0,1/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht. We see
that for any/⊣\}br⊣cketle{ty,1/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht∈Q×{1},/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tx,0/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht/medcircle/⊣\}br⊣cketle{ty,1/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htand/⊣\}br⊣cketle{t0,1/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht/medcircle/⊣\}br⊣cketle{ty,1/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht, yet/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tx,0/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htC//⊣\}br⊣cketle{t0,1/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht.
14This is not, then, the product of the two algebras as the contact algebras. The relation
/angbracketleftx, u/angbracketrightR/angbracketlefty, w/angbracketright:←→ xCTy∧uC1wis not contact, as the reader may easily convince themself.GRZEGORCZYK AND WHITEHEAD POINTS: THE STORY CONTINUES 15
Thirdly, any product Q×M, where Mis an at least two element subset of B4,
fails to be a chain and so cannot be a G-representative. Fourt hly, if we have a
setM×{0}where Mis not a G-representative, i.e., it fails to meet one of the
conditions ( r0)–(r3), then since 0≪10,M×{0}also fails to meet one of the four
conditions for≪.
Of course, every Q×{0}is an abstractive set, and in the case where it covers
an abstractive set A×{0},Qmust cover Ain RO( R). So by Proposition 4.2(iii)
Ais a W-representative in RO( R), and so A×{0}is a W-representative in P./square
5.W-representatives with countable coinitiality are
G-representatives
In this section, we reconstruct Biacino and Gerla ’s proof according to which
every W-representative that can be represented by an ω-sequence (in the sense
explained below) is also a G-representative. We aim to show t hat with respect to
the original proof from ( Biacino and Gerla ,1996) we need to assume the so-called
coherence axiom to assure that the machinery works properly.
To be more precise, Biacino and Gerla in Theorem 5.3 prove that if we extend
the standard axiomatization for contact with the interpolation axiom15:
(IA) x≪y−→(∃z∈B)x≪z≪y
we can prove that every Whitehead representative that can be represented as an ω-
sequence is a Grzegorczyk representative. However, to show that a certain sequence
of regions is an abstractive set they make a transition that c annot be justiﬁed with-
out an application of the so-called coherence axiom, that we introduce below. Thus,
in the premises of Theorem 5.3we explicitly assume coherence in the form of ( C6)
below. Coherence is a mereotopological counterpart of topo logical connectedness.16
Deﬁnition 8. For a given chain Clet the coinitiality ofCbe the smallest cardinal
number κsuch that there exists an antitone function f:κ→Cwith f[κ] coinitial
with C. ⊣
Deﬁnition 9. For a given B∈BWCA , let Qω
Wbe the set of all Whitehead
representatives whose coinitiality is ω. ⊣
Observe that the set Afrom Example 2is an instance of a W-representative
whose coinitiality is ω1. On the other hand, a local basis of any point r∈R(with
the standard topology) that satisﬁes ( R1) is a W-representative that is an element
ofQω
Win RO( R).
Deﬁnition 10. A Boolean weak contact algebra is coherent17iﬀ its unity is coher-
ent, iﬀ it satisﬁes the following coherence axiom:
⊣ (C6) x /∈{0,1}−→ xC−x .
Proposition 5.1. In the class BWCA ,(C6)is equivalent to :
x /∈{0,1}∧x≪y−→x < y .
Proof. (−→) Ifxis neither 0nor1, then xC−x. Assume that x≪y, i.e., xC/−y.
Ify=1, then x < y . So suppose y/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=1. Since x≤y, also y/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0andyC−y.
Therefore x/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=y, which means that x < y , as required.
(←−) Ifx /∈{0,1}andxC/−x, then x≪x, and x < x by the assumption.
A contradiction. /square
15They call it the normality axiom.

Recall that the following condition holds in every BCA:
(5.1) x≪u∧y≪v−→x·y≪u·v .
Proposition 5.2. In every B∈BCA ,(C6)is equivalent to the following condition :
x/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=u∧x≪u∧y≪v−→x·y≪u·v∧x·y/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=u·v .
Proof. (−→) Assume ( C6). If x/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=u∧x≪u∧y≪v, then by ( 5.1) we have that
x·y≪u·v, so by ( C6) we obtain: x·y/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=u·v,
(←−) Suppose there is x /∈{0,1}such that x≪x. Since x≪1andx/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=1, by
the hypothesis we have that x·x/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=x·1, a contradiction. /square
Theorem 5.3 (after Biacino and Gerla ,1996).IfB∈BCA + (IA) + (C6), then
Qω
W⊆QG.
Proof. LetAbe an abstractive set, and let ( xi)i∈ωbe its coinitial subset. Assume it
is not a G-representative, i.e., that it fails to satisfy ( r3). Let then uandvbe such
that for every i∈ω,u/medcirclexi/medcirclev, but u≪−v. Observe that u/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=v. By ( IA)
(and by the Axiom of Dependent Choices), there is a sequence ( ui)i∈ωsuch that:
u≪. . . u 2≪u1≪u0=−v .
We have that for every i, j∈ω, (a) ui·xi/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0and (b) xj/notlessequalui·xi(since ui·xi≪−v
andxj/medcirclev, i.e. xj/notlessequal−v). Observe that ( ui·xi)i∈ωis an abstractive set. ( r0) is
a consequence of (a), ( r1) holds for the sequence because of ( 5.1):ui+1·xi+1≪ui·xi.
Butui·xi/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=1, so thanks to Proposition 5.1we have that ( ui·xi)i∈ωsatisﬁes ( A).
The sequence is covered by ( xi)i∈ω, but ( xi)i∈ωis not covered by ( ui·xi)i∈ωby
(b), so the former cannot be a W-representative. So Ais not a W-representative,
either. /square
As it can be seen in the proof above, there are two ways two just ify the conclusion
that ( ui·xi)i∈ωmeets the condition ( A): either by an application of Proposition 5.1
or by a reference to Proposition 5.2. Both these conditions are equivalent to ( C6),
so there is no way to escape the coherence axiom in the constru ction. This, of
course, does not show that ‘ Qω
W⊆QG’ is independent from BCA + (IA), as it only
means that the proof itself requires ( C6). Nor does it undermine the construction
from the proof, as the remedy is relatively simple and only ca lls for the explicit
assumption of the axiom. However, it would be desirable to fu lly know the status
of the coherence axiom with respect to the sentence ‘ Qω
W⊆QG’ . As we have not
been able to settle it, we put forward the following:
Problem 2.Show that ‘ Qω
W⊆QG’ cannot be deduced from the axioms for Boolean
contact algebras extended with the interpolation axiom. Th at is, ﬁnd an alge-
braB∈BCA + (IA) + (∄At) that has a W-representative which is not a G-
representative. Similarly, show that ‘ Qω
W⊆QG’ is not true in some B∈BCA +
(C6) + (∄At). We add the assumption about the non-existence of atoms, si nce
Biaciono and Gerla have it among their postulates.
It was proven in ( Düntsch et al. ,2001) that those Boolean contact algebras that
satisfy ( C5) and ( C6) must be atomless. In light of this and Theorems 4.4and5.3
we have:
Theorem 5.4. IfB∈BCA + (IA) + ( C5) + ( C6), then Qω
W⊆QG⊆QW. If
additionally Bsatisﬁes the countable chain condition, then QW=QG.
Recall that a topological space Xissemi-regular iﬀ it has a basis that consist
of regularly open subsets of X. It is weakly regular iﬀ for every non-empty openGRZEGORCZYK AND WHITEHEAD POINTS: THE STORY CONTINUES 17
setMthere exists a non-empty open set Ksuch that Cl K⊆M.Xisκ-normal18
(orweakly normal ) iﬀ any pair of disjoint regular closed sets can be separated by
disjoint open sets.
By (Düntsch and Winter ,2005, Proposition 3.7) we have that for a space Xand
a dense subalgebra Bof/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(X),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htthe following correspondences hold:
(i)CTsatisﬁes ( C5) iﬀXis weakly regular,
(ii)CTsatisﬁes ( C6) iﬀXis connected,
(iii) CTsatisﬁes ( IA) iﬀXisκ-normal.
LetTBCA be the class of all topological contact algebras, that is those of the form
/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tB,CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht, whereBis a subalgebra of a regular open algebra RO( X) of a topological
space X.
Lemma 5.5 (Bennett and Düntsch ,2007, Lemma 3.56) .B∈TBCA + (IA) +
(C5) + (C6)iﬀBis a dense subalgebra of /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(X),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht, where Xis aκ-normal,
connected T1-space.
In consequence, by this and by Theorem 5.4we obtain:
Corollary 5.6. IfXis aκ-normal, connected T1-space, and Bis a dense sub-
algebra of/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(X),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht, then in B:Qω
W⊆QG⊆QW. If additionally Xas
a topological space satisﬁes the countable chain condition , then QW=QG.
Theorem 4.4shows that the second-order statement ‘ QG⊆QW’ corresponds
to a ﬁrst-order property of atomlessness of Boolean algebra s. It is then natural to
ask if the statements ‘ Qω
W⊆QG’ and ‘ QW⊆QG’ correspond to any familiar, not
necessarily ﬁrst-order, properties of BCAs, or topologica l BCAs. Let us focus on
this, and let us prove some negative results.
Observe that the coherence axiom cannot be deduced by means o f ‘QW⊆QG’
(more so, by means of ‘ Qω
W⊆QG’), in the following sense:
Proposition 5.7. (C6)is not true in BCA + (IA) + (C5) + (∄At) +QW⊆QG.
Proof. Take the contact algebra /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(R),/medcircle/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htand apply Lemma 3.8. /square
If the reader ﬁnds the reference to Lemma 3.8somewhat sneaky (as there are no
W-representatives in BCAs that satisfy the premises), we ca n construct an example
of a BCA that has W-representatives and meets the conditions of the proposition
but not ( C6) by taking the topological space X:= [0 ,1]∪[2,3] as the subspace of the
reals with the standard topology and considering /⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(X),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht.Xis normal (more
so,κ-normal), T1, satisﬁes the countable chain condition. Thus QW⊆QG. RO( X)
is obviously atomless. Moreover, Xis metrizable, so it’s a concentric space and thus
has W-representatives by Theorem 3.6. But Xhas two non-trivial components,
and thus CTdoes not satisfy ( C6). Does adding the assumption QW/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=∅does not
improve the situation.
Making a suitable modiﬁcation to X, e.g., taking Y:= [0 ,1]∪{2}we see that:
Proposition 5.8. (∄At)is not a consequence of BCA + (IA) + (C5) +QW⊆QG.
Of course, by Theorem 4.4, in RO( Y) we have QG/notsubseteqlQW, speciﬁcally with {{2}}
being the culprit.
As for the relation of ( C5) to ‘ QW⊆QG’, observe that since the axiom is
not a consequence of {(C0)–(C4),(IA),(C6),(∄At)}, it cannot be a consequence of
{(C0)–(C4),‘Qω
W⊆QG’}by Theorem 5.3. Thus there may be no deeper connection
between the two statements.
The above are selective remarks that show what cannot be prov en by or about
the inclusion ‘ QW⊆QG’ . So, we put forward other open problems:
18These spaces were introduced and studied by Shchepin (1972 ).18 RAFAŁ GRUSZCZYŃSKI, SANTIAGO JOCKWICH MARTINEZ
Problem 3.FindB∈BCA + (C6) +QW⊆QGin which the interpolation axiom
fails.
Problem 4.Characterize the class BCA +QW⊆QG, with possibly additional
constraints.
We also ask:
Problem 5.Is there any topological property of a space Xthat corresponds to the
statement QW⊆QG, as a second order statement formulated about a subalgebra
of/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tRO(X),CT/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht?
6.W-representatives are G-representatives (the general case)
Having proven Theorem 5.3 (of whose counterpart is—by a fort unate coincidence—
our Theorem 5.3)Biacino and Gerla write:
[. . . ] the just proven theorem holds for W-representatives t hat are
expressible by [countable] sequences. We do not know if this result
holds in any case.
In this section, we prove that the we can extend Theorem 5.3to W-representatives
of an arbitrary coinitiality provided we assume the generalized version of the inter-
polation axiom.
Observe that by ( 5.1) the interpolation axiom is equivalent to the following:
x≪x1∧. . .∧x≪xn−→(∃z∈B) (x≪z∧z≪x1·. . .·xn).
Thus its natural extension to inﬁnite cases is the following second-order constraint:
(GIA) (∀Y∈P(B)) ((∀y∈Y)x≪y−→(∃z∈B) (x≪z∧(∀y∈Y)z≪y)).
Observe that ( GIA) axiom puts a serious constraint upon the existence of W-
representatives in the class of complete contact algebras:
Theorem 6.1. IfB∈BCA +(C5)+(GIA)is complete, then there are no Whitehead
representatives in B.
Proof. It is easy to show that in complete Boolean contact algebras, (GIA) is equiv-
alent to the following second-order constraint:
(∀y∈J)x≪y−→x≪/logicalanddisplay
J
which is equivalent to the following generalized version of (C4):
xC/logicalordisplay
J−→(∃y∈J)xCy .
As it has been shown in ( Gruszczyński and Menchón ,2022), in presence of ( C5)
the latter axiom entails that C=/medcircle. Thus by Lemma 3.8,Bdoes not have any
W-representatives. /square
It follows that if we want to have BCAs that satisfy ( GIA) and have Whitehead
representatives, we must drop either ( C5) or completeness, or both. Fortunately,
we can demonstrate that such algebras exist.
Theorem 6.2. Any/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tB,Cd/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htsatisﬁes (GIA).
Proof. Take as the distinguished element of a B∈BAanyd/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0and consider Cd.
Suppose that A⊆B, and let xbe such that for all a∈A,x≪da, which means
that either x≤a−dorx+d≤a. In the former case, x≤−d, sox≪dx, and
we are done. In the latter, x+d≪da, as−amust be disjoint from x+d. Since
it is always true that x≪dx+d, we have that x+dis the region that is strongly
between xanda. /squareGRZEGORCZYK AND WHITEHEAD POINTS: THE STORY CONTINUES 19
In light of the above theorem, any Boolean algebra can be turn ed into a Boolean
contact algebra that meets the generalized interpolation a xiom. In particular, there
will be such algebras that are either complete or incomplete , with or without any
atoms, and of arbitrary cardinality. However, in light of Co rollary 4.6, none of these
algebras will satisfy ( C5).
Having shown the consistency of ( GIA) with the standard axioms for contact,
we go on to prove the following:
Theorem 6.3. IfB∈BCA + (GIA) + (C6), then QW⊆QG.
Proof. Suppose|B|=κ. Fix an abstractive set A. Since it is linearly ordered by
≤, it must have a coinitial sequence /⊣\}br⊣cketle{txα|α < λ/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htfor a limit ordinal λ/lessorequalslantκ. Again,
suppose the sequence is not a G-representative, i.e. it fail s to satisfy ( r3). Let u
andvbe regions such that each of them overlaps every xαfrom the sequence, yet
they are separated, i.e., u≪−v. We construct another λ-sequence repeating the
technique from the proof of Theorem 5.3, but applying ( GIA).
Ifλ=ω, then it is enough to observe that ( IA) is just a special case of ( GIA)
where Y:={−v}. So assume that λ > ω . Suppose α < λ is a limit ordinal and for
every δ < β < α we deﬁned uβanduδsuch that:
u≪uβ≪uδ≪−v .
Consequently, we have that uis a non-tangential part of every element of the
sequence/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tuβ|β < α/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht. Thus, by ( GIA) we may choose uαto be a region zsuch
that (∀β < α )z≪uβandu≪z. Following this procedure we can construct the
λ-sequence/⊣\}br⊣cketle{tuα|α < λ/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht. We go on to show that /⊣\}br⊣cketle{txα·uα|α < λ/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htis an abstractive
set. ( r0) holds given that we have uα·xα/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=0for any α < λ . (r1) holds due to
(5.1):uδ·xδ≪uβ·xβfor any β, δ∈λsuch that β < δ . Additionally,we have that
uα+1·xα+1≪uα·xαanduα·xα/\e}⊣tio\sl⊣sh=1for any α < λ . Therefore, by Proposition 5.1
the sequence/⊣\}br⊣cketle{txα·uα|α < λ/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htsatisﬁes ( A).
Notice that the sequence /⊣\}br⊣cketle{txα·uα|α < λ/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htis covered by/⊣\}br⊣cketle{txα|α < λ/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht. However,
we also have that xβ/notlessequaluδ·xδfor any β, δ∈λsince uδ·xδ≪−vandxβ/notlessequal−v.
Therefore,/⊣\}br⊣cketle{txα|α < λ/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htis not covered by/⊣\}br⊣cketle{txα·uα|α < λ/⊣\}br⊣cketri}ht. Thus,/⊣\}br⊣cketle{txα|α < λ/⊣\}br⊣cketri}htis not
a W-representative and we can conclude that also Ais not a W-representative. /square
Problem 6.In Theorem 6.2we have shown that the generalized interpolation axiom
is consistent with the standard axioms for BCAs. However, wh at we do not know
is whether there are contact algebras in which both the axiom s (GIA), (C6) hold,
and there is at least one W-representative. Thus we ask: are there such BCAs?
