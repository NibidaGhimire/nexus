We investigate the eﬀect of ﬂow ﬂuctuations, incorporated i n non boost-invariant blast-wave
model, on kinetic freeze-out parameters of identiﬁed hadro ns in low energy relativistic heavy-ion
collisions. For the purpose of this study, we use the transve rse momentum spectra of the identiﬁed
hadronsproducedincentral Pb–Pbcollisions, atSPSenergi es rangingfrom E Lab= 20A−158A GeV,
andanalyze themwithin amodiﬁednonboost-invariant blast wavemodel. Weperform simultaneous
ﬁts of the transverse momentum spectra for light hadrons ( π−,K±,p) and heavy strange hadrons
(Λ,¯Λ,φ, Ξ±, Ω±) separately. We also ﬁt the transverse momentum spectra of c harmonia (J/Ψ, Ψ′)
at ELab= 158A GeV. Our ﬁndings suggest that the inclusion of ﬂow ﬂuct uations enhances kinetic
freeze-out temperature in case of light and heavy strange ha drons and reduces the corresponding
transverse ﬂow velocities. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the kineti c freeze-out parameters of the charmonia
at ELab= 158A GeV are least aﬀected by inclusion of ﬂow ﬂuctuations. Based on this, we make
predictions which can provide further insights on the role o f ﬂowﬂuctuations in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions.
I. INTRODUCTION
Collisions of relativistically accelerated heavy-ions in
the laboratory allow production and study of hot and
dense Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD) matter [ 1–
3]. Tuning of collision energy can enable the possibil-
ity of creating nuclear matter at various temperatures
and baryon densities which can probe a large part of
QCD phase diagram. Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) [ 4,5] and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [ 6–8]
accelerate nuclei with ultra-relativistic speeds which cre-
ates medium having thermodynamic conditions of high
temperatures and negligible baryon chemical potentials.
Lattice QCD (lQCD) simulations [ 9–13] are well suited
for the study of such medium.
Nuclear matter corresponding to the region of moder-
ate temperature and ﬁnite net baryon densities in QCD
phase diagram is created by lowering the beam energies.
The application of lQCD to study such matter is limited.
However, in recent times, the interest in studying nu-
clearcollisionsattheseenergieshasbeenrejuvenatedand
many ongoing as well as upcoming accelerator facilities
at RHIC [ 14], Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) [ 15,16],
Facility for Anti-proton Ion Research (FAIR [ 17,18] and
Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) [ 19], have
performed and planned various experimental programs.
Thisincludesthebeamenergyscan(BES)andSTARFxt
(ﬁxed target) program of RHIC, NA61 and NA60+ ex-
periments at SPS, Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM)
experiment at FAIR, and Baryonic Matter at the Nu-
clotron(BM@N)and Multi-PurposeDetector (MPD) ex-
periment at NICA. The systematic interpretation of the
availabledatafromearlierﬁxed-targetmode experiments
at AGS and SPS facilities in these beam energy rangescan allow an appropriate utilization of the upcoming fa-
cilities. Outofseveralchallenges,estimationoffreeze-out
conditions of the ﬁreball at various beam energies has
been one of the compelling topics in heavy-ion collisions.
The particle chemistry of the ﬁreball stabilizes during
the chemical freeze-out as the inelastic scatterings stop,
whereas, during kinetic freeze-out, the momentum dis-
tributions of the hadrons are frozen. The quark ﬂavour
dependent multiple chemical freeze-out scenario where
strange hadrons ﬁx their composition earlier than light
hadrons, was predicted by the authors of Ref. [ 21]. Sim-
ilar observations were found for mass dependent kinetic
freeze-outof the measured hadronsin the ﬁxed targeten-
ergy domain [ 22]. In general, hydro-inspired blast-wave
model can be used to describe kinetic freeze-out condi-
tions [23]. The particle spectra from hydrodynamics was
described by assuming the emission from cylindrically
symmetric and boost-invariant ﬁreball [ 24]. Over the
years there have been several modiﬁcations to the orig-
inal formulation of the blast wave model. Recently, the
formulation of non-boost-invariant blast-wave model [ 25]
was employed at AGS and SPS energies in our previous
worksto describe the transverse and longitudinal spectra
of identiﬁed hadrons [ 22,26].
The main assumptions in the formulation of the blast
wave model are the following: the freeze-out isotherm
is described at a constant proper time ( τ= const) and
the transverse rapidity proﬁle at the isotherm has a lin-
ear form. Other assumptions are neglecting the pres-
enceofﬂowﬂuctuations,on-massshelldistributionsfunc-
tions, a homogeneous number density and absence of res-
onance feed-down. The assumption of absence of reso-
nance feed-down has been taken into consideration by us
for pions in our previous work [ 26]. In the present ar-2
ticle, we have accounted for ﬂow ﬂuctuations following
the Ref. [ 27] which was applied to the boost-invariant
blast-wave model. Due to the ﬁnite size of the systems
generated in heavy-ion collisions, signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations
are expected during the initial stages of the collisions.
This applies even to collisions with ﬁxed impact param-
eters. The initial conditions of hydrodynamical calcula-
tions are sensitive to these ﬂuctuations whose impact can
survive till the freeze-out. Therefore it is crucial to con-
sider these ﬂuctuations in the blast wave model. Further
details regarding this implementation will be presented
in the following section.
In this article, we have modiﬁed the non-boost-
invariant blast-wave model following the idea from
Ref. [27] and employed this modiﬁed non boost invari-
ant blast-wave model to study the eﬀect of ﬂow ﬂuctu-
ations on the kinetic freeze-out conditions of identiﬁed
hadrons in central Pb–Pb collisions at SPS energies. In
Ref. [27], the authors have considered two diﬀerent for-
mulations, namely, Flat or Uniform and Gaussian dis-
tribution of hydrodynamical velocities for implementing
the ﬂow ﬂuctuations (more details in sec. II). To accom-
plish our goal, we examine the pT-spectra of identiﬁed
particles within beam energy range E Lab= 20A−158A
GeV. The identiﬁed particles are catogorized according
to their mass as, light hadrons ( π−,K±,p) and heavy
strange hadrons (Λ, ¯Λ,φ, Ξ±, Ω±) as well as charmonia
(J/ψandψ′only at E Lab= 158A GeV). The rapidity
spectra are not analyzed in this article since it is ex-
pected to be insensitive to the changes in the transverse
ﬂow proﬁle1. Our ﬁndings in this article predicts higher
kinetic freeze-out temperature and lower in transverse
ﬂow velocity using both uniform as well as Gaussian for-
mulations compared to no ﬂuctuations scenario for both
light as well as heavy strange hadrons across all analyzed
beam energies. Interestingly, the kinetic freeze-out tem-
perature and transverse ﬂow velocity corresponding to
charmed hadrons does not show any signiﬁcant change
in both formulations with respect to no ﬂuctuations sce-
nario. We also found that the mass hierarchy of the ki-
netic freeze out parameters as argued in our previous
analysis is still preserved even in presence of transverse
ﬂow ﬂuctuations.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt
to incorporate the ﬂow ﬂuctuations into the non-boost-
invariantblast-wavemodeltodescribethetransversemo-
mentumspectraofidentiﬁedhadronsatSPSenergies. As
mentioned earlier, authors of Ref. [ 27] have implemented
the ﬂow ﬂuctuations into the boost-invariant blast-wave
model to study the heavy hadrons namely, J/ψ,φand
Ω. There was an attempt made to consider the trans-
verse ﬂow ﬂuctuations in non-central collisions by the

Bessel-Gaussian formulations for the descriptions of the
initial state eccentricityﬂuctuations which arenot purely
Gaussianespeciallyfor peripheralcollisions. Since in this
article, we are exclusively dealing with central collisions,
we refrain from using the Bessel Gaussian formulation.
The organization of the article is as follows: Follow-
ing the introduction in this section, the features of the
blast-wave model and its modiﬁcation for incorporating
transverseﬂowﬂuctuationsisdescribed insectionII. The
results are presented and discussed in section III. In sec-
tion IV we summarize and conclude our ﬁndings from
this study.
II. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL
In this section, we brieﬂy introduce the non boost-
invariant blast wave model. For more details, the reader
is referred to Refs [ 22,25,26]. Within the framework of
this model, the single particle spectrum for central colli-
sions with respect to transverse mass mT(≡/radicalbig

and rapidity ycan be written as,

wheregis the degeneracy of particle species and η
(≡tanh−1(z/t)) is the space-time rapidity. Moreover,
we haveβT= tanh(ρ) whereρis the ﬂow rapidity in the
transverse plane (or transverse rapidity) and βTis the
collective transverse ﬂuid velocity. Under the assump-
tion that the common freeze-out of the ﬁreball is instan-
taneous, the freeze-out time τFbecomes independent of
the transversecoordinate r⊥and occurs at kinetic freeze-
out temperature T. Considering a Hubble like expansion
of the ﬁreball in the transverseplane, the transverseﬂuid

whereβsdenotes the transverse ﬂuid velocity at the sur-
face of the ﬁreball. It is important to note that in the
above equation, we have R(η) in the denominator as op-
posedtoR0inthemodelfromRef. [ 25]. Due tothis char-
acteristic, for a given non-zero η, the transverse ﬂow goes
to zero at the center and takes the maximum value βsat
the edges of the ﬁreball as r⊥approaches to R(η). For
the case of a linear parametrization, the average trans-
verse ﬂow velocity becomes ∝angbracketleftβT∝angbracketright=2

independent of η.
As discussed earlier, it is important to note that the
presence of ﬂow ﬂuctuations has been neglected in the3

diﬀerential spectra shown in Eq. 1. Because of the ﬁnite
system size, large ﬂuctuations in the initial stage of the
heavy-ion collisions may appear, even in the central colli-
sions. These ﬂuctuations can aﬀect the initial conditions
of the hydrodynamical expansion of the medium. More-
over, owing to the nonlinear nature of hydrodynamic
equations, the event average of any hydrodynamical pa-
rameter is quite diﬀerent from that for a smooth initial
conﬁguration. This leads to large diﬀerences in spec-
tra obtained from hydrodynamical calculations with av-
eraged initial conditions, compared to ﬂuctuating initial
conditions [ 30–32]. Therefore it is important to incorpo-
rate the collective ﬂow ﬂuctuations in blast-wave model
to examine their eﬀect on the kinetic-freeze-out param-
eters. To this end, we consider new form of non-boost-
invariant blast-wave model averaged over an ensemble of
the ﬂuctuations, motivated from Ref [ 27] for the trans-verse surface velocity, βsas:

η= 0. The dependence on R0factors out after chang-
ing the integral variable r⊥→r⊥/Rin Eq. (3) which
lead to an overall factor of volume, τFR2
0. Moreover, the
assumption of the boost-invariance is relaxed by the ex-
plicit dependence of system boundary in the transverse
plane on the longitudinal coordinate, as parameterizedin
Eq. (5). At the freeze-out surface, the temperature is as-
sumed to be constant. Moreover, the transverseﬂow gra-
dient is independent of r⊥and it has only ηdependence
throughR(η). One can notice from Eq. ( 3) that the vari-
abler⊥takes values between 0 ≤r⊥≤R(η). However,the transverse velocity βT(r⊥) given in Eq. ( 2) remains
ﬁnite and lies in the physical range (preserves causality)
forβs<1, even though R(η)→0 asη→ ±ηmax. In
addition, we observe from Eq. ( 2) that the transverse
ﬂow gradient along r⊥diverges as η→ ±ηmax. This
makes the model unsuitable for those analyses involving
the quantities which depend on gradients, such as dissi-
pative eﬀects. Nevertheless, in our framework we do not
deal with such gradients since we are employing the non-
dissipative blast wave model and hence such issues are
not encountered in the implementation of this model.
One may argue that because of the elliptic shape of
the ﬁreball in the reaction plane in Eq. ( 5), the system
sizedecreasesawayfrom midrapidityand hence ﬂowﬂuc-
tutations may get stronger. Therefore, the parameters
in Eq. (4) should depend on space-time rapidity. How-
ever, it is important note that almost all of the analyzed
species in the present work are measured at mid-rapidity.
Moreover, the η-dependence of temperature was studied
inRef.[25]. Theauthorsconcludedthatthechangeinthe
temperature due this dependence is small without com-
promising the χ2/Ndf, which suggests that same might
also be true for transverse velocity. Therefore the eﬀect
ofη-dependence on the model parameters is expected to6

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Results obtained from this study have been presented
and discussed in this section. For this purpose, we
have analyzed the measured transverse momentum spec-
tra (pT) of light, heavy strange and charmed (only at
ELab= 158A GeV) hadrons produced in central Pb–Pb
collisions from NA49 and NA50 collaboration [ 33–35] at
SPS in the beam energy range E Lab= 20A−158A GeV.
The hadrons analyzed in this manuscript were catego-
rized according to their masses, following the intuition
that heavy particles may decouple earlier than lighter
ones. Note that we have focused only at SPS energies
as the data for heavier particles in the desired kinematic
regions are barely available at lower beam energies. Res-
onance decay contributions to the lightest hadron in our
dataset, i.e. pions, are taken into consideration follow-
ing the formalism in Ref. [ 36]. AllpT-spectra analyzed
here are calculated at center of measured rapidity region
(e.g. atyc.m.= 0.1, for 0< yc.m.<0.2) of the hadron.
We have explicitly checked that ﬁt of pT-spectra at the
central value of measured rapidity coverage of a particu-
lar species does not yield any signiﬁcant changes in the
valuesofthe parameterswhencomparedwith the param-
eters obtained by ﬁtting the spectra integrated over the
measured rapidity region. Therefore, the main message
ofourpaperremainsunaltered. Theﬁtsof pT-spectraare
performed simultaneously for each category of hadrons
by minimizing the value of χ2/Ndof, whereNdofis the
number of degrees of freedom deﬁned as the number of
data points minus the number of ﬁtting parameters. In
our analysis, the minimization procedure was performed
using MINUIT [ 37] package available in ROOT frame-
work [38].
For the adopted linear transverse ﬂow proﬁle, essen-
tially, there are three parameters associated with our
non-boost invariant blast-wavemodel; see Eq. ( 1). These
parameters are Tkin,ηmaxandβsout of which two pa-
rameters,Tkinandβsare sensitive to the pT-spectra. On
the other hand, the pT-spectra is rather insensitive to
ηmaxand the rapidity spectra is insensitive to the other
two parameters, Tkinandβs. Moreover, because of the
non-Bjorken ﬂow, the rapidity spectra are sensitive to
ηmax[26,39]. This was the main reason that we did not
consider to analyze rapidity spectra of the hadrons under
study usingEq.( 3). Alongwith this, wealsocheckedthis
explicitly by ﬁtting the rapidity spectra by intergating
Eq. (3) with respect to pTto obtain the desired longitu-
dinal spectra and we found that the parameter, ηmaxis
unchanged. Therefore, we have used the values of ηmax
obtained from our previous analyses [ 22,26], where, the
values ofηmax,Tkinandβswere obtained recursively.
Firstly,ηmaxis ﬁxed from the simulatenous ﬁts of the
rapidity distributions with initial guess of Tkinandβs,
and then this ηmaxis used to ﬁt corresponding pTdistri-butions. These newly extracted Tkinandβsvalues are
thenusedtogetupdated ηmax. Thisprocedureconverges
rather quickly.
As discussed in Section II, there are two cases, namely,
uniform and Gaussian distributions, corresponding to
the form of ﬂuctuations F(βs), considered in this study.
First, we start by ﬁtting the pT-spectra of light and
heavystrangehadronsusingEq.( 3)withtheformercase,
F(βs) = 1. Using this approach we extract three param-
eters, namely, βmin
s,βmax
sandTkin. For the comparison,
the average of the uniform dostribution is also estimated
which is deﬁned as, β0
s= (βmin
s+βmax
s)/2. The quality
of the ﬁts is better than and in few cases similar to the
default case, i.e. no ﬂuctuations scenario.
The obtained ﬁt parameters are tabulated in Table I.
We have noticed that the predicted new Tkinvalues are
higher than the ones from our previousanalyses, where it
was between 80 −85 MeV for light hadrons and 90 −110
MeV for heavy strange hadrons. This seems to be the
consequence of the implementation of the ﬂow ﬂuctua-
tions into ourmodel, to which the initial hydrodynamical
conditions are expected to be sensitive and subsequently,
aﬀect the kinetic-freezeout conditions. It is important
note that for uniform ﬂow ﬂuctuation proﬁle, the ﬁtted
value of transverse ﬂow velocity is smaller than the de-
fault case, i.e., without ﬂuctuations. In order to compen-
sate for smaller transverse ﬂow velocity, the ﬁtted value
of kinetic freeze-out temperature is larger than the de-
fault case. This may be attributed to the fact that both
transverse ﬂow velocity and temperature leads to hard-
ening of transverse momentum spectra
Moving on to the second case of ﬂow ﬂuctuations, we
have used the Gaussian description of hydrodynamical
velocities (Eq. ( 4)) and haveﬁtted the pT-spectra oflight
and heavy strange hadrons using Eq. ( 3). In this case,
we have ﬁxed the lower and upper limits of the Gaussian
function,F(βs) to be 0 and 1, respectively. However,
the parameters Tkin,δandβ0
sare kept as free. Here as
well, the quality of the ﬁts is better, and in a few cases
similar to the no ﬂuctuations scenario. The ﬁt parame-
ters obtained from this analysis aretabulated in Table II.
The observation is that the Tkinvalues are even higher
than uniform description case and β0
svalues are smaller
than the ones from our previous analyses, where it was
between 0.77−0.82 for light hadrons and 0 .65−0.70 for
heavy strange hadrons. Moreover, values of δparame-
ter vary between 0 .03−0.15 for both light hadrons and
heavy strange hadrons.
As mentioned earlier, in case of Gaussian ﬂow ﬂuctu-
ation proﬁle the transverse ﬂow velocity is even smaller
than uniform ﬂow ﬂuctuation proﬁle. Therefore, in order
tocompensateforsmallertransverseﬂowvelocity, theﬁt-
ted value of kinetic freeze-out temperature is larger than
the uniform case. One may argue that because of the
ﬁxed limits on the Gaussian distribution, i.e., 0 and 1,
the tails may cut asymmetrically and subsequently, the
central point of the Gaussian distribution may not be
correct parameter, instead, the average βsmay be bet-8

However, we have checked that the average and the cen-
tralvaluesagreeuptothreedecimalplaces, andtherefore,
it makes no signiﬁcant diﬀerence to the results.
Next we look at the beam energy dependence of these
extracted ﬁt parameters as shown in Fig. 5. Here, we
have compared the values of β0
sandTkinof light hadrons
and heavystrangehadronsobtainedfrom this study with
no ﬂuctuations scenario. Now, variation in the values of
these parameters can be clearly seen in case of ﬂow ﬂuc-
tuationwith respecttonoﬂuctuations. It isalsointerest-
ing to observe even stronger beam energy dependence of
Tkinin caseoftheﬂowﬂuctuations. Moreover,lookingat
theexcitationfunctionsoftheseparametersqualitatively,
one may ﬁnd the trends interesting. To investigate this
in detail, we estimate the diﬀerences of Tkinandβ0

non-monotonous structure for both uniform as well as
Gaussian formulations, with a minima/maxima around
ELab≈30A−40A GeV which is an interesting beam en-
ergy region. There has been many instances in the beam
energy domain, E Lab= 20A−158A GeV where vari-
ous observables have shown some interesting irregulari-
ties around E Lab≈30A−40A GeV [ 40]. This behaviour
has often been linked to the potential signature of the
onset of deconﬁnement. However, in our case, one needs
to be careful and perform more detailed investigations to
make any robust claims.
Moving on, charmonia, i.e. J/ ψ,ψ′have been ana-
lyzed in boost-invariant scenario [ 41] and in non-boost-
invariant case as well [ 22], based on the hypothesis that

tion. In the present study, after light and heavy strange
hadrons, similar exercise was performed for J/ψand9

value (= 1.70) from our previous study was used for the

achieved here as well for both uniform and Gaussian dis-
tribution of the transverse velocities. The values of the

ﬂuctuations we obtain, Tkin= 165 MeV, δ= 0.05 and
β0

andβ0
sare found to be similar to the case of no ﬂuctua-
tions, which was, Tkin= 164 MeV and β0
s= 0.3. More-
over, theβ0
sand its spread are lower than those of light
and heavy strange hadrons where the freeze-out param-
eters,Tkinandβ0
s, showed sensitivity to the assumption
of ﬂow ﬂuctuations.
In Fig8, an updated partial expansion history of
the ﬁreball after incorporation of the ﬂow ﬂuctuations
into the transverse momentum spectra is presented.
The freeze-out parameters for light, heavy strange andcharmed hadrons obtained with no ﬂuctuations and
Gaussian prescription are plotted at E Lab= 158A GeV.
It is very interesting to see that the eﬀect of ﬂow ﬂuctua-
tionsonthefreeze-outparametersforcharmedhadronsis
quitesmallcomparedtoothertwogroupsofspecies. This
can be interpreted as follows: Due to small rescattering
cross-sections in the hadronic phase, the momentum dis-
tributions of charmonia are also frozen near the phase
boundary, similar to their chemical composition closer to
the hadronization. This reﬂects in the fact that Tkinfor
charmonia is close to TcorTCFO. Because of this, the
radialﬂowandassociatedﬂuctuationsarenotfullydevel-
oped and show insensitivity as opposed to heavy strange
and light hadrons. Our study may provoke more eﬀorts
in this direction as well as subsequent studies from us
will be performed in due time.10

IV. SUMMARY
To summerize, we have made some eﬀorts to study
the eﬀect of ﬂow ﬂuctuations on the kinetic freeze-outparameters of various particle species. For this pur-
pose, we have modiﬁed the non-boost-invariant blast-
wavemodelfollowingRef.[ 27]wheretheauthorsincorpo-
rated the ﬂow ﬂuctuations into the boost-invarint blast-
wave model. Two diﬀerent functional forms of the βs
distribution were considered, namely uniform and Gaus-
sian description. We analyzed the transverse momentum
spectra of diﬀerent hadron species in central Pb–Pb col-
lisions at diﬀerent SPS beam energies. The transverse
momentum spectra were ﬁtted simultaneously to obtain
various freeze-out parameters such as β0
sandTkin. The
temperatures obtained using both descriptions showed
higher values comparedto the case ofno ﬂuctuations sce-
nariowhere it wasbetween 80 −85MeV for light hadrons
and 90−110 MeV for heavy strange hadrons. With in-
clusion of ﬂow ﬂuctuations , the temperature varies be-
tween 90 −110 MeV for light hadrons and 105 −140MeV
for heavy strange hadrons. Similarly, decrease in the β0
s
values was observed for both descriptions at all beam en-
ergies with respect to no ﬂuctuations scenario where it
was between 0 .77−0.82 for light hadrons and 0 .65−0.70
for heavy strange hadrons. Incorporation of ﬂuctuations
madeβsto reduce between 0 .73−0.76 for light hadrons
and 0.58−0.64 for heavy strange hadrons. Moreover, we
saw a stronger increase in the temperature as function
of beam energies compared to no ﬂuctuations scenario.
Furthermore, values of standard deviation, i.e. δparam-
eter varies between 0 .03−0.15for both light hadrons and
heavy strange hadrons. We also ﬁtted the charmonia at
Elab= 158AGeV and found that the temperature as
well asβ0
svalues remain almost unchanged for both de-
scriptions with respect to no ﬂuctuations scenario. This
suggests that the incorporation of ﬂow ﬂuctuations does
not aﬀect the kinetic freeze-out conditions for charmo-
nia. This could be due to the fact that the radial ﬂow
and corresponding ﬂuctuations are not fully developed11
due to freezing of momentum spectra immediately after
or simultaneously at chemical freeze-out and therefore,
the parameters are robust against the ﬂow ﬂuctuations.
This is one of the interesting ﬁndings of our work.
As an outlook, these results can trigger further at-
tempts to look at the ﬂow ﬂuctuations more closely
at diﬀerent centralities and also in the explanation of
anisotropic ﬂow coeﬃcients. When the experimental
measurements of anisotropic ﬂow coeﬃcients of identi-
ﬁed hadronsincluding charmoniawith various cumulants
becomes available, the ﬁndings of this model can be ver-
iﬁed. Moreover, it will be interesting to repeat such ex-ercise with charmed hadrons for lower energy collisions,
when the data become available. This can be achieved
with the upcoming measurements at SPS and we leave
this analysis for the future.
