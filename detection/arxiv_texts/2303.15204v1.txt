Abstract
We introduce a nonconforming virtual element method for the Poisson equation on domains

1 Introduction
Partial diﬀerential equations are often posed on domains with curv ed boundaries and internal
interfaces. The geometric error between a curved interface/bo undary and a corresponding “ﬂat”
approximation aﬀects the accuracy of the standard ﬁnite element method, leading to a loss of
convergence for higher-order elements [32, 33]. This phenomenon has been addressed in many
diﬀerent waysin the literature, the most classicalbeing to employ iso parametricﬁnite elements [26,
28], which require a polynomial approximation of the curved boundar y and a careful choice of the
isoparametric nodes; another notable approach, which applies to C AD domains, is that of the
Isogeometric Analysis [21].
Both issues can be avoided employing curved virtual elements [10]. Th e virtual element
method [5, 7] was designed a decade ago as a generalization of the ﬁn ite element method to a
Galerkin method based on polytopal meshes. Basis functions are de ﬁned as solutions to local par-
tial diﬀerential problems with polynomial data. An explicit represent ation of the basis functions
is not required; rather, the scheme is designed only based on a suita ble choice of the degrees of
freedom.
In [10], test and trial virtual element functions are deﬁned (in 2D) s o as their restrictions on
curved edges are mapped polynomials. Other variants were develop ed later. In [8], again focusing
on the 2D case only, virtual element functions over curved edges a re restrictions of polynomials.
In [11], a boundary correctiontechnique tracing backto the pionee ringwork [13] was generalizedto
the virtual element setting; here, normal-directional Taylor expa nsions are used to correct function
values on the boundary. The gospel of [10] has been applied to the a pproximation of solutions
to the wave equation in [23]. Mixed virtual elements on curved domain s are analyzed in two and
three dimensions in [22, 24].
Other polytopal element method have been designed for curved do mains. Amongst them, we
recallthe extendedhybridizablediscontinuousGalerkinmethod [27]; the unﬁtted hybridhigh-order
method [17, 16]; the hybrid high-order method for the Poisson [12, 34] and (singularly perturbed)
fourth order problems [25]; the Treﬀtz-based ﬁnite element metho d [2].

1In this paper, we focus on the Poissonproblem, design a nonconfor mingvirtual element method
on curved domains and with internal curved interfaces, prove arb itrary order optimal convergence
estimates in the energy and L2norms, and validate the theoretical results with numerical results .
The proposedscheme is a generalizationof the standard nonconfo rmingvirtual element method
to the case of curved boundaries and internal interfaces. Indee d, when the curved boundaries
happen to be straight, the proposed virtual space boils down to th at in [3]. Compared to its
conformingnodal version[10], in principlethe nonconformingscheme canbe designed andanalyzed
in any dimension at once.
The proposed method is based on the computation of a novel Ritz-G alerkin operator that, due
to computability reasons, is diﬀerent from the standard H1projection operator typically employed
in virtual elements. A noteworthy challenge of the forthcoming ana lysis resides in developing
optimal approximation estimates for such a Ritz-Galerkin operator ; this result is interesting per
se and could be borrowed also by other methods handling curved bou ndaries/interfaces.
Even though the standard nonconforming virtual element can be a lgebraicallyequivalent to the
hybrid high-order method [20] for a particular choice of the stabiliza tion, the method presented in
this paper diﬀers from the hybrid-highordermethods on curved do mainsavailablein the literature.
Preliminary notation. We denote the usual Sobolev space of order m,m≥0, on an open
bounded Lipschitz domain DinRd,d∈N, byHm(D). We endow it with the inner-product
(·,·)m,D, the norm /ba∇dbl · /ba∇dblm,D, and the seminorm | · |m,D. LetH1
0(D) the subspace of H1(D) of
functions with zero trace over the boundary ∂DofD. Whenm= 0, the space H0(D) is the space
L2(D) of square integrable functions over D. In this case, ( ·,·)0,D= (·,·)Ddenotes the standard
L2inner-product. Sobolev spaces of negative order can be deﬁned b y duality. The notation /an}b∇acketle{t·,·/an}b∇acket∇i}ht
stands for the duality pairing H−1
2−H1
2on a given domain.
Further, we introduce the Sobolev spaces Wm,∞(D),m∈N, of functions having weak deriva-
tives up to order m, which are bounded almost everywhere in D. The case m= 0 coincides with
the usual space L∞(D); the spaces of noninteger order m≥0,m/ne}ationslash∈N, are constructed, e.g., by
interpolation theory. The corresponding norm and seminorm are /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblWm,∞(D)and|·|Wm,∞(D).
Model problem. Let Ω⊂Rd,d= 2,3, be a Lipschitz domain with (possibly) curved bound-
ary∂Ω. GivenfinL2(Ω) andginH1
2(∂Ω), we consider the following Poisson problem: Find u
such that/braceleftBigg
−∆u=fin Ω,
u=gon∂Ω.(1.1)
IntroduceVg={u∈H1(Ω) :u|∂Ω=g},V:=H1
0(Ω), and the bilinear form
a(u,v) :=/integraldisplay
Ω∇u·∇vdΩ∀u,v∈H1(Ω).
A variational formulation of (1.1) reads as follows:
/braceleftBigg
Findu∈Vgsuch that
a(u,v) = (f,v)0,Ω∀v∈V.(1.2)
We assume that the boundary ∂Ω is the union a ﬁnite number of smooth curved edges/faces
{Γi}i=1,···,N, i.e.,
N/uniondisplay
i=1Γi=∂Ω.
Each Γ iis of class Cη, for an integer η≥1, which will ﬁxed in Assumption 5.1 below: if d= 2,
there exists a given regular and invertible Cη-parametrization γi:Ii→Γifori= 1,...,N, where
2Ii:= [ai,bi]⊂Ris a closed interval; if d= 3, there exists a given regular and invertible Cη-
parametrization γi:Fi→Γifori= 1,...,N, whereFiis a straight polygon. The smoothness
parameterηdepends on the order of the numerical scheme and will be speciﬁed la ter.
Since all the Γ ican be treated analogouslyin the forthcoming analysis, we drop the indexiand
assume that ∂Ω contains only one curved face Γ. To further simplify the presenta tion, we focus on
the two dimensional case and postpone the discussion of the three dimensional case to Section 7
below. We further assume that γ: [0,1]→Γ.
Remark 1.1. The forthcoming analysis can be extended to the case of inter nal interfaces (and
jumping coeﬃcients) with minor modiﬁcations. To simplify t he presentation, we stick to the case
ofΓbeing a curved boundary face; however, we shall present nume rical experiments for jumping
coeﬃcients across internal curved interfaces.
Structure of the paper. In Section 2, we introduce regular polygonal meshes, and broken a nd
nonconforming polynomial and Sobolev spaces. In Section 3, we des ign a novel nonconforming
virtual element method for curved domain; show its well posedness ; discuss its lack of polynomial
consistency. In Sections 4 and 5, we prove stability and interpolatio n properties of the new virtual
element functions. Section 6 is devoted to the proof of the rate of convergence in the H1andL2
norms. Details on the 3D version of the method are discussed in Sect ion 7. In Section 8, we present
numerical experiments that verify the theory established the pre vious sections.
2 Meshes and broken spaces
In this section, we introduce regular polygonal meshes with whom we associate broken polynomial
and Sobolev spaces, and nonconforming polynomial spaces.
2.1 Mesh assumptions
Let{Th}be a sequence of partitions of Ω into polygons, possibly with curved e dges along the
curved boundary. We denote the diameter of each element KbyhKand the mesh size function
ofThbyh:= max K∈ThhK. LetEhbe the set of edges in Th. We denote the size of any edge e
byhe, where the size of a (possibly curved) edge is the distance between its two endpoints; see
Remark 2.1 below. Let EI
handEB
hbe the sets of all interior and boundary edges in ThwithEh,c
andEh,sdenoting the sets of curved and straight edges in Th, respectively.
For each element K∈ Th, we denote the sets of its edges by EK, which we split into straight EK
s
and curved edges EK
c, respectively. We denote the set of elements containing at least on e edge
inEB
hbyTB
h; an element KinTB
hmay contain more than one edge in EB
h. With each element K,
we associate the outward unit normal vector nK; with each edge e, we associate a unit normal
vectorneout of the available two.
Henceforth, we demand the following regularity assumptions on the sequence {Th}: there exists
a positive constant ρsuch that
(G1)each element Kis star-shaped with respect to a ball of radius larger than or equal toρhK;
(G2)for each element Kand any of its (possibly curved) edges e,heis largerthan or equal to ρhK.
Assumptions ( G1)–(G2) imply that each element has a uniformly bounded number of edges.
We introduce a parametrization of the edges:
•for any straight edge ewith endpoints x1
eandx2
e, we introduce the parametrization γe(t) =
t
he(x2
e−x1
e)+x1
e;
•for any curved edge e, we introduce the parametrization γe:Ie⊂I:= [0,1]→eas the
restriction of the global parametrization γ:I→Γ to the interval Ie.
3Remark 2.1. Let the lenght of a curved edge ℓe=/integraltext
Ie/ba∇dblγ′(t)/ba∇dbldt. Sinceγandγ−1are ﬁxed once and
for all, and are of class W1,∞, the quantity heintroduced above is comparable with ℓe. Therefore
in the following we shall simply refer to both quantities as “ length”.
We shall write x/lessorsimilaryandx/greaterorsimilaryinstead ofx≤Cyandx≥Cy, respectively, for a positive
constantCindependent of Th. Moreover, x≈ystands forx/lessorsimilarbandb/lessorsimilaraat once. The involved
constants will be written explicitly only when necessary.
The validity of ( G1)–(G2) guarantees that the constants in the forthcoming trace and inv erse
inequalities are uniformly bounded.
2.2 Broken and nonconforming spaces
LetPn(K),n∈N, be the space of polynomials of maximum degree nover each element K; we
use the convention P−1(K) ={0}. GivenxKthe centroid of K, we introduce a basis for the
spacePn(K) given by the set of scaled and shifted monomials
Mn(K) =/braceleftbigg/parenleftbiggx−xK
hK/parenrightbiggα
∀α∈N2,|α| ≤n,∀x∈K/bracerightbigg
.
Here,αdenotes a multi-index α= (α1,α2).
Similarly, let Pn(Ie),n∈N, be the space of polynomials of maximum degree nover the inter-
valIe. GivenxIeandhIethe midpoint and length of Ie, we introduce a basis for the space Pn(Ie)
given by the set of scaled and shifted monomials
Mn(Ie) =/braceleftbigg/parenleftbiggx−xIe
hIe/parenrightbiggα
∀α∈N, α≤n,∀x∈Ie/bracerightbigg
.
Recalling that γe:Ie⊂I→edenotes the parametrization of the edge e, we consider the following
mapped polynomial space and scaled monomial set:
/tildewidePn(e) ={/tildewideq=q◦γ−1
e:q∈Pn(Ie)},/tildewiderMn(e) ={/tildewidem=m◦γ−1
e:m∈ Mn(Ie)}.
Ifeis straight, then /tildewidePn(e) and/tildewiderMn(e) boil down to a standard polynomial space and scaled
monomial set, respectively. For any s>0, we introduce the broken Sobolev space over a mesh Th
as
Hs(Th) :={v∈L2(Ω) :v|K∈Hs(K)∀K∈ Th},
and equip it with the broken norm and seminorm
/ba∇dblv/ba∇dbl2
s,h:=/summationdisplay
K∈Th/ba∇dblv/ba∇dbl2
s,K,|v|2
s,h:=/summationdisplay
K∈Th|v|2

We deﬁne the jump across the edge eof anyvinH1(Th) as
[[v]] :=/braceleftBigg
v|K+nK++v|K−nK−ife∈ EI
h,e⊂∂K+∩∂K−for givenK+,K−∈ Th

h,e⊂Kfor a given K∈ Th.
The nonconforming Sobolev space of order koverThis given as follows:
H1,nc(Th,k) :=/braceleftbigg

e/llbracketv/rrbracket·neqds= 0,∀q∈/tildewidePk−1(e),∀e∈ Eh/bracerightbigg
.
In the straight edges case, this space coincides with the standard nonconforming Sobolev space
in [3].
43 The nonconforming virtual element method on curved
polygons
In this section, we introduce the nonconforming virtual element me thod for the approximation of
solutions to (1.2). In Section 3.1, we introduce the local and global v irtual element spaces and
endow them with suitable sets of degrees of freedom (DoFs). In Se ction 3.2, we discretize the
bilinear form by means of computable polynomial projectors and sta bilizing bilinear forms. With
this at hand, we introduce the method in Section 3.3.
3.1 Nonconforming virtual element spaces
We deﬁne a local virtual element space of order kinNon the (possibly curved) element K:
Vh(K) :=/braceleftBig
vh∈H1(K)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∆vh∈Pk−2(K),nK·∇vh∈/tildewidePk−1(e)∀e∈ EK/bracerightBig
.(3.1)
We havethat Pn(K)|e=/tildewidePn(e) ifeis a straightedge; instead, if eis a curved edge, P0(K)|e⊂/tildewidePn(e)
but in general, Pn(K)|e/ne}ationslash⊂/tildewidePn(e). This implies that on curved elements the space Vh(K) contains
constant functions but not the space Pk(K).
We can deﬁne the following sets of degrees of freedom for the spac eVh(K).
•on each edge eofK, the moments
Di
e(vh) =|e|−1/integraldisplay
evh/tildewidemids∀/tildewidemi∈/tildewiderMk−1(e); (3.2)
•the bulk moments
Dj
K(vh) =|K|−1/integraldisplay
KvhmjdK∀mj∈ Mk−2(K). (3.3)
In Figure 3.1, we give a graphic representation for such linear funct ionals in the case k= 2.
Figure 3.1: Representation of the DoFs for k= 2. The edge moments (3.2) are the black balls (for straight
edges) and red balls (for curved edges); the bulk moments (3. 3) are the internal orange circles.
The following result generalizes [3, Lemma 3 .1] to the case of curved elements.
Lemma 3.1. The sets of linear functionals (3.2)and(3.3)are a set of unisolvent DoFs for the
spaceVh(K).
5Proof.The number oflinear functionals in (3.2) and (3.3) equalsthe dimension ofthe space Vh(K).
So, we only have to prove the unisolvence. Let vhinVh(K) be such that
Di
e(vh) = 0∀e∈ EKandDj
K(vh) = 0∀i= 1,···,k;j= 1,···,k(k−1)/2.(3.4)
Then, it suﬃces to prove vh= 0. To this aim, we integrate by parts, use (3.4), and obtain
/integraldisplay
K|∇vh|2dK=/integraldisplay
K−∆vhvhdK+/summationdisplay
e∈EK/integraldisplay
enK·∇vhvhds= 0.
We deduce ∇vh= 0 inK, whencevhis constant. Thanks to (3.4), vhhas zero average over each
edge. The assertion follows.
The global nonconforming virtual element space is constructed by a standard coupling of the
interface degrees of freedom (3.2):
Vh(Th) :=/braceleftbig
vh∈H1,nc(Th,k)/vextendsingle/vextendsinglevh|K∈Vh(K)∀K∈ Th/bracerightbig
. (3.5)
Further,wedeﬁnenonconformingvirtualelementspaceswithwea klyimposedboundaryconditions:

e(vh−g)/tildewideqk−1= 0∀/tildewideqk−1∈/tildewidePk−1(e), e∈ EB
h/bracerightbigg
.(3.6)
The above spaces and degrees of freedom are a generalization to c urved elements of their straight
counterparts in [3]. Interpolation estimates are derived in Section 5 below.
Remark 3.2. The enhanced version of the space Vh(K)[1] involves a modiﬁcation of the space
inside the element and not on the (curved) edges. Therefore, designing an enhanced version of the
local spaces in (3.1)is straightforward by combining the tools in [1] with the tec hniques presented
here.
3.2 Polynomial projectors and discrete bilinear forms
Here, we introduce projections onto polynomial spaces, stabilizing bilinear forms, and a discrete
bilinear form.
Projections onto polynomial spaces. On each element K, we introduce projection operators
onto polynomial spaces of maximum degree ninN:
•the (possibly curved) edge L2projection/tildewideΠ0,e
n:L2(e)→/tildewidePn(e) given by
/integraldisplay
e/tildewideqn(v−/tildewideΠ0,e
nv) ds= 0∀/tildewideqn∈/tildewidePn(e); (3.7)
•the Ritz-Galerkin projection /tildewideΠ∇,K

n:L2(K)→Pn(K) given by
/integraldisplay
Kqn(v−Π0,K
nv) dK= 0∀qn∈Pn(K). (3.10)
Remark 3.3. If all the edges of an element Kare straight, then /tildewideΠ∇,K
kqk=qkfor allqkinPk(K)
and/tildewideΠ∇,K
kboils down to the standard VEM operator Π∇,K
k[5]. Instead, if at least one edge of K
is curved, then /tildewideΠ∇,K
kqk/ne}ationslash=qkunlessk= 0. This fact is the reason of the lack of polynomial
consistency of the method on curved elements.
Next, we show that the three projectors above are computable b y means of the DoFs.
Proposition 3.4. Given the DoFs (3.2)–(3.3)of a givenvhinVh(K), we can compute /tildewideΠ0,e
k−1vh|e,
Π0,K
k−2vh, and/tildewideΠ∇,K
kvh, where the three operators are deﬁned in (3.7),(3.8)–(3.9), and(3.10),
respectively.
Proof.The computability of /tildewideΠ0,e
k−1vh|eand Π0,K
k−2followsimmediately from the edge and bulk DoFs,
respectively. As for /tildewideΠ∇,K
kvh, since the average condition (3.9) is obviously computable, it suﬃces
to show the computability of the right hand side of (3.8). The ﬁrst te rm on the right-hand side is
computable from (3.3); the second and third terms are computable from (3.2).
Remark 3.5. Diﬀerently from the standard nonconforming virtual elemen t framework [3], we do
not use anH1projection, but rather the Ritz-Galerkin projection /tildewideΠ∇,K
kin(3.8)–(3.9). The reason
is that the deﬁnition of the local space and the choice of the D oFs would not allow us to compute the
standardH1projection from the degrees of freedom, due to the noncomput ability of/integraltext
e(nK·∇qn)vh
on curved edges.
A discrete bilinear form. We deﬁne a discretelocalbilinearform aK
h(·,·) :Vh(K)×Vh(K)→R
on each element Kas follows:
aK
h(uh,vh) =aK(/tildewideΠ∇,K
kuh,/tildewideΠ∇,K
kvh)+SK((I−/tildewideΠ∇,K
k)uh,(I−/tildewideΠ∇,K
k)vh)∀uh, vh∈Vh(K).
Above,SK(·,·) :Vh(K)×Vh(K)→Ris a bilinear form that satisﬁes two properties: it is com-
putable via the local set of DoFs over K; it satisﬁes the stability bounds
|vh|2

1,K∀vh∈Vh(K)∩ker(/tildewideΠ∇,K
k). (3.11)
Denoting by {Dl}Ndof(K)
l=1the set of all degrees of freedom of Vh(K), a possible stabilization satis-
fying (3.11) is
SK(uh,vh) =Ndof(K)/summationdisplay
l=1Dl(uh)Dl(vh),
which can be rewritten in terms of boundary and bulk contributions a s

e(vh)+k(k−1)/2/summationdisplay
j=1Dj

K(vh). (3.12)
We postpone to Section 4 below the analysis of such a stabilizing term. Of course, other stabiliza-
tions satisfying the computability and stability properties can be deﬁ ned; we stick to the choice
in (3.12) since it is the most popular in the virtual element community.
Remark 3.6. The bilinear form aK
h(·,·)does not satisfy the usual consistency property of the
virtual element method [3, 5] when Kis a curved polygon. The reason is the use of a polynomial
projection that is not the usual H1projection; see Remark 3.3 for further details.
Finally, we introduce a global discrete bilinear form ah(·,·) :Vh×Vh→Rdeﬁned as
ah(uh,vh) =/summationdisplay
K∈ThaK
h(uh,vh)∀uh, vh∈Vh. (3.13)
7The discrete right-hand side. Here, we construct a computable discretization of the right-
hand side ( f,vh)0,Ωin (1.2). For k≥2, we introduce
(fh,vh)0,Ω=/summationdisplay
K∈Th/integraldisplay
KfΠ0,K
k−2vhdK ∀vh∈Vh; (3.14)
Instead, for k= 1, we approximate fby its piecewise projection onto constants, average the test
functionvhover the edges of K, and write

3.3 The method
We propose the following nonconforming virtual element method:
/braceleftBigg
ﬁnduh∈Vg
h(Th) such that
ah(uh,vh) = (fh,vh)0,Ω ∀vh∈V0
h(Th).(3.16)
The well posedness of method (3.16) requires further technical t ools, which we derive in Section 4
below. For this reason, we postpone its proof to Theorem 4.9.
Remark 3.7. Method(3.16)is designed for meshes with rather general C1curved edges. The
assumptions on the meshes in Section 2.1, and notably the fac t that curved edges are used only on
the (ﬁxed) curved boundary, will be used to derive convergen ce estimates in Section 6 below.
4 Stability analysis
In this section, we prove the stability bounds (3.11) for the stabiliza tion (3.13). We proceed in
some steps. First, we recall the inverse inequalities in [9, Lemma 6 .3] for curved elements. The
proof is independent on whether the element is curved or not.
Lemma 4.1. LetK∈ Th, for anyv∈H1(K)such that ∆v∈Pn(K), we have
/ba∇dbl∆v/ba∇dbl0,K/lessorsimilarh−1
K|v|1,K.
We introduce the scaled norm
|||w|||1
2,∂K:=h−1
2
K/ba∇dblw/ba∇dbl0,∂K+|w|1
2,∂K,
and the corresponding negative norm
|||w|||−1
2,∂K:= sup
q∈H1
2(∂K)/integraltext
∂Kqwds
|||q|||1
2,∂K.
We recall the Neumann trace inequality for Lipschitz domains; see, e .g., [30, Theorem A.33].
Lemma 4.2. Given an element KandvinH1(K)such that ∆vbelongs toL2(K), we have
|||nK·∇v|||−1
2,∂K/lessorsimilar|v|1,K+hK/ba∇dbl∆v/ba∇dbl0,K.
Next, we state a polynomial inverse inequality on the boundary of an elementK.
Lemma 4.3. Given an element KandvhinVh(K), we have
/ba∇dblnK·∇vh/ba∇dbl0,∂K/lessorsimilarh−1
2
K|||nK·∇vh|||−1
2,∂K.
8Proof.Using that vhbelongs toVh(K), we have that nK·∇vhbelongs to/tildewidePk−1(e). So, proving the
assertion boils down to proving a mapped polynomial inverse estimate ; see, e.g., [4, Lemma 2 .3].
The uniformity of the constant follows from the regularity of the pa rametrization of the curved
edge.
We are ready to show the continuity of the stabilization SK(·,·) in (3.12).
Proposition 4.4. Given an element K,vhandwhinVh(K), andSK(·,·)as in(3.12), we have
the continuity property
SK(vh,wh)/lessorsimilar(h−2
K/ba∇dblvh/ba∇dbl2

2(h−2

2.
Ifvhandwhhave zero average on Kor∂K, we further deduce
SK(vh,wh)/lessorsimilar|vh|1,K|wh|1,K.
Proof.By the standard Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, it is suﬃcient to prove that
SK(vh,vh) =/summationdisplay

We bound the edge and boundary contributions on the left-hand sid e separately. We start with
the ﬁrst one. The standard trace inequality asserts that
h−1
K/ba∇dblvh/ba∇dbl2
∂K/lessorsimilarh−2
K/ba∇dblvh/ba∇dbl2
0,K+|vh|2

Recall that miinMk−1(Ie) are shifted and scaled monomials of maximum degree k−1 overIe.
Then, using the regularity of the element, we have /ba∇dblmi/ba∇dbl2
Ie/lessorsimilarhIe≈he≈hK. Recalling that each
element has a uniformly bounded number of edges, it follows that

which is the bound on the edge contributions of the stabilization in (3.1 2).
Next, we show the upper bound for the second term on the left-ha nd side of (4.1). Since we
have that /ba∇dblmj/ba∇dblL∞(K)≤1 for any shifted and scaled monomial mjinMk−2(K), it is possible to

which concludes the main part of the proof. The ﬁnal assertion follo ws immediately from known
Poincar´ e-type inequalities on Lipschitz domains.
In order to show the coercivity of the stabilization SK(·,·) in (3.12), we need a further technical
result; see, e.g., [19, Lemma 4 .1] for the straight edge case (the extension to curved edges follo ws
with a mapping argument).

stability estimates for the global discrete bilinear form ah(·,·) are an immediate consequence.
Proposition 4.8. Given an element Kand the discrete bilinear form aK
h(·,·)based on the stabi-
lization in (3.12), we have the stability estimates

Proof.We ﬁrst prove the lower bound. Let ¯ vh=vh−Π0

aK(vh,vh)=aK(¯vh,¯vh)/lessorsimilarSK(¯vh,¯vh)/lessorsimilarSK((I−/tildewideΠ∇,K
k)¯vh,(I−/tildewideΠ∇,K
k)¯vh)+SK(/tildewideΠ∇,K
k¯vh,/tildewideΠ∇,K
k¯vh).
Since/tildewideΠ∇,K

k)¯vh= (I−/tildewideΠ∇,K
k)vh. From Proposition 4.4
applied to the second term on the right-hand side of the inequality ab ove, we infer

11Using (4.6) and |/tildewideΠ∇,K

Upon using Proposition 4.8 and the Brenner-Poincar´ e inequality [14], we derive the following
global stability estimates and the well posedness of method (3.16).

As a consequence, method (3.16)is well posed.
5 Polynomial and virtual element approximation estimates

tions. Notably, we investigate the approximation properties of the three following approximants
for suﬃciently regular functions v:

Assumption 5.1. Henceforth, the regularity parameter ηof the curved boundary introduced in
Section 1 satisﬁes η≥k.
Polynomial error estimates for vπare well know; see e.g.[15]:
/ba∇dblv−vπ/ba∇dbl0,K+hK|v−vπ|1,K/lessorsimilarhk+1
K|v|k+1,K∀v∈Hk+1(K).
To prove interpolation error estimates, we present an auxiliary err or estimate, which can be proven
proceeding along the same lines as in [10, Lemma 3 .2] for the operator /tildewideΠ0,e
n.
Lemma 5.2. Letn∈Nand the regularity parameter ηof the curved boundary satisfy η≥n+1.
Then, given an element Kand any of its edges e, for all0≤m≤s≤n+1, we have

We alsorecallthe propertiesofthe Stein’s extension operator Ein [31, ChapterVI, Theorem5].
Lemma 5.3. Given a Lipschitz domain ΩinR2ands∈R,s≥0, there exists an extension
operatorE:Hs(Ω)→Hs(R2)such that
Ev|Ω=vand/ba∇dblEv/ba∇dbls,Rd/lessorsimilar/ba∇dblv/ba∇dbls,Ω∀v∈Hs(Ω). (5.3)
The hidden constant depends on sbut not on the diameter of Ω.
We are in a position to show the ﬁrst local interpolation result.
Lemma 5.4. GivenvK

We split the edge contributions into curved and straight edges term s. As for the curved edges
terms, we use Lemma (5.2) with n=k−1 (recalling Assumption 5.1) and write

To end up with error estimates involving terms only in the domain Ω and n ot on its boundary, we
use the Stein’s extension operator of Lemma 5.3. For any curve Γ ion the boundary of ∂Ω, letCi
be a domain in R2with part of its boundary given by ∂Ci∈Ck,1. Then, applying the standard
trace theorem on smooth domains and the stability of the (vector v alued version) Stein’s extension
operator in (5.3), we get

6 Convergence analysis
In this section, we present the error analysis in the energy and L2-norms for the nonconforming
virtual element method (3.16); see Sections 6.1 and 6.2, respective ly. In particular, we ﬁrst derive
Strang-like error bounds and derive optimal error estimates base d on the tools in Section 5.
6.1 Convergence analysis in the energy norm
We prove the error estimates in the energy norm in some steps. Firs t, we discuss details on
geometrical errors due to the presence of curved elements.
Given a curved edge e, we denote the straight segment with endpoints given by the vertic es
ofeby/hatwidee; see Figure 6.1.

/ba∇dblne−/hatwiden/hatwidee/ba∇dblL∞(e)/lessorsimilarhK/ba∇dblγ/ba∇dblW1,∞(Ie). (6.1)
15With the notation as in Figure 6.1, for any curved edge ewith endpoints x1

e, we introduce
the linear map ζ:Ie→/hatwideegiven by
ζ(t) =t−t1

We further deﬁne the constant tangent vector to /hatwidee

We have that ˆt/hatwideeis equivalently deﬁned as ζ′(t). Analogously, we can deﬁne te:=γ′(t). Since we
are approximating a curved edge by a straight segment, it is known t hat, see, e.g., [18, eq. (2.18)],
/ba∇dblˆt/hatwidee−te/ba∇dblL∞(Ie)/lessorsimilarhK/ba∇dblγ/ba∇dblW1,∞(Ie).

Finally, we clearly have ψ◦ζ∈Pn(Ie) for anyψinPn(/hatwidee). Thus, we write

With this notation at hand, we derive error estimates for the Ritz-G alerkin projector /tildewideΠ∇,K
kdeﬁned
in (3.8)–(3.9).
Lemma 6.1. For allvinHs+1(Ω),1≤s≤k, we have
|v−/tildewideΠ∇,K
kv|1,h/lessorsimilarhs/ba∇dblv/ba∇dbls+1,Ω. (6.5)
Proof.According to the triangle inequality and the approximation propertie s of Π∇,K
k, we have

By deﬁnition of /tildewideΠ∇,K

Ifk= 1, we have by deﬁnition of Vh(K) that Π∇,K

So, we focus on the case k≥2. We set

Let˜ψ:e→R2be the mapped polynomial associated to ψ|e, i.e.,˜ψ:=ψ◦ζ◦γ−1∈/tildewidePk−1(e).
Since, by the same observation in (6.3), ˜ψ·ˆn∈/tildewidePk−1(e), we deduce
/ba∇dbl(I−/tildewideΠ0,e

As for the second term on the right-hand side of (6.7), we use (6.2) :

Recalling the Stein’s extension operator Ein Lemma 5.3 with stability properties as in (5.3) and
proceeding along the same lines of Lemma 5.4, we obtain

2,∂Ci/lessorsimilar/ba∇dblEv/ba∇dbls,Ci≤ /ba∇dblEv/ba∇dbls,Rd/lessorsimilar/ba∇dblv/ba∇dbls,Ω.
The assertion follows combining the two estimates above.
Remark 6.2. Lemma 6.1 plays a critical role in the optimality with respec t tokof the convergence
estimates detailed in Theorems 6.6 and 6.7 below. A more dire ct approach would not exploit that e
converges to/hatwideeash→0; the ensuing approximation estimate would either be sub-op timal (order
hk−1/2in theH1norm) or require a higher order polynomial degree on curved e dges in the deﬁnition
of the local spaces thus leading to a more computationally ex pensive scheme.
17Next, we provide results that are instrumental to derive optimal c onvergence of the method;
see Theorem 6.6. We begin by recalling the discretization error on the right-hand side; see, e.g.,
[5, Section 4 .7].
Lemma 6.3. Let the right-hand side fof(1.1)belong toHs−1(Ω),ℓ≤s≤k+1, whereℓ= 2
ifk= 1,ℓ= 1ifk≥2, and the discrete right-hand side fhbe as in (3.14)–(3.15). Then, for
anyvhinVh, we have
|(f−fh,vh)0,K|/lessorsimilar/braceleftBigg
h|f|1,Ω|vh|1,hfork= 1,
hs|f|s−1,Ω|vh|1,hfork>1.
Next, we introduce a bilinear form that will allow us to take into accoun t the nonconformity of
the method in the error analysis, namely Nh:H3
2+ε(Ω)×H1,nc(Th,k)→Rdeﬁned by
Nh(u,vh) :=/summationdisplay
K∈Th/integraldisplay
∂K(nK·∇u)vhds=/summationdisplay
e∈Eh/integraldisplay
e∇u·[[vh]] ds.
Ifu, the solution to (1.1), belongs to H3
2+ε(Ω) and is such that ∆ ubelongs to L2(K) for all
elementsK, an integration by parts implies that
a(u,v) = (f,vh)+Nh(u,vh)∀vh∈Vh⊂H1,nc(Th,k). (6.12)
In the following result, we cope with the estimate of the term related to the nonconformity of the
scheme.
Lemma 6.4. Letu, the solution to (1.1)belong toHs+1(Ω),1/2<s≤k. Then, for all vhinVh,
we have
|Nh(u,vh)|/lessorsimilarhs/ba∇dblu/ba∇dbls+1,Ω|vh|1,h.
Proof.The proof follows along the same line as those in [3, Lemma 4.1]. We brieﬂy report it here
for the sake of completeness.
From the deﬁnitions of the space H1,nc(Th,k) and the operator /tildewideΠ0,e
k−1, recalling that P0(e)⊂
/tildewidePk−1(e), ﬁnally using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, we ﬁnd

and the Poincar´ e inequality, for each internal edge e=∂K+∪∂K−, we get

Next, we estimate from above a term measuring the lack of polynomia l consistency of the
proposed method, i.e., the error between the bilinear functions a(·,·) andah(·,·).
Lemma 6.5. Letuthe solution to (1.1)belong toHs+1(Ω),1≤s≤k. Then, we have
|ah(u,vh)−a(u,vh)|/lessorsimilarhs/ba∇dblu/ba∇dbls+1,Ω|vh|1,h∀vh∈Vh.
18Proof.For any element K, we have
aK
h(u,vh)−aK(u,vh) =aK(/tildewideΠ∇,K

Theorem 6.6. Letuanduhbe the solutions to (1.1)and(3.16), respectively. Then, for every uI

19Furthermore, if u∈Hs+1(Ω)andf∈Hs−1(Ω), with1≤s≤k, we also have
|u−uh|1,h/lessorsimilarhs(/ba∇dblu/ba∇dbls+1,Ω+|f|s−1,Ω). (6.15)
Proof.We ﬁrst prove the Strang-type estimate (6.14). We split u−uhas (u−uI)+(uI−uh), use
the triangle inequality, and get
|u−uh|1,h≤ |u−uI|1,h+|uI−uh|1,h.
Seteh:=uh−uI. Following the lines of [3, Theorem 4 .3] and recalling (6.12), the coercivity
ofah(·,·) allows us to write

The proof of (6.14) follows by standard manipulations of the right-h and side above. The error
estimates (6.15) ﬁnally follow bounding the terms on the right-hand s ide of (6.14) by means of
Lemmas 5.5, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5.
6.2 Convergence analysis in a weaker norm
In this section, we prove L2error estimates for (3.16) based on extra assumptions on Ω. Also
in this case, we follow the guidelines of the nonconforming element met hod error analysis; see [3,
Section 4.1]. We focus on the case k≥3, and discuss the cases k= 1 and 2 in Remark 6.8 below.
Theorem 6.7. Letk≥3. Assume that uandf, the solution and right-hand side of (1.1), belong
toHs+1(Ω), andHs−1(Ω),1≤s≤k. Letuhbe the solution to (3.16). IfΩis convex, then we
have
/ba∇dblu−uh/ba∇dbl0,Ω/lessorsimilarhs+1(/ba∇dblu/ba∇dbls+1,Ω+|f|s−1,Ω).
Proof.Consider the dual problem
/braceleftBigg
−∆φ=u−uhin Ω,
φ= 0 on ∂Ω.
The convexity of Ω entails that φ∈H2(Ω)∩H1
0(Ω) is the unique solution to the above problem
and satisﬁes the elliptic regularity estimates
/ba∇dblφ/ba∇dbl2,Ω/lessorsimilar/ba∇dblu−uh/ba∇dbl0,Ω.
Proceeding as in [3, Theorem 4 .5] using that k≥3, and taking φIinVhas the DoFs interpolant
ofφin (5.2), we obtain

Combining the above estimates and using Lemmas 5.5, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5, the assertion follows.
Remark 6.8. The proof of Theorem 6.7 does not cover the cases k= 1and2, the reason being
the presence of the term
(f−fh,φI)0,Ω.
Following [6, Section 2.7], one can derive optimal converge nce in the L2norm fork= 1and
one order suboptimal convergence for k= 2. In this case, optimality can be recovered by either a
suitable modiﬁcation of the right-hand side (using better d iscretization of the test function in the
discrete loading term) or by adapting the enhanced version o f the virtual element method.
7 The 3D version of the method
In this section, we discuss the nonconforming virtual element meth od for 3D curved domain and
why the theoretical results are an extension of their two-dimensio nal counterparts. Polyhedral
meshesarenowemployedandcurvedfacesaretheparametrizatio nsofﬂatpolygons. Thegeometric
assumptions (G1)–(G2)in Section 2 are still required, but are valid for Kbeing a polyhedron.
We further require
(G3)every faceFofK(or, if the face is curved, the associated parametric polygon /hatwideF) is star-
shaped with respect to all the points of a disk radius larger than or e qual toρhK.
The local nonconforming virtual element space on the (possibly cur ved) polyhedron Kreads
Vh(K) :=/braceleftBig
vh∈H1(K)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∆vh∈Pk−2(K),nK·∇vh∈/tildewidePk−1(F)∀F⊂∂K/bracerightBig
,
where/tildewidePk−1(F) is the push forward on FofPk−1(/hatwideF). The deﬁnition of Vhis the natural extension
of its 2D counterpart. The degrees of freedom are given by scaled (possibly curved) face moments
with respect to (possibly mapped) polynomials up to order k−1 and scaled bulk moments up
to orderk−2. The global nonconforming virtual element space is obtained by a n onconforming
coupling of the face degrees of freedom as in the 2D case:
Vh(Th) :=/braceleftbig
vh∈H1,nc(Th,k)/vextendsingle/vextendsinglevh|K∈Vh(K)∀K∈ Th/bracerightbig
,
where /llbracket·/rrbracketFis the jump across the (possibly curved) face and
H1,nc(Th,k) :=/braceleftbigg
v∈H1(Th)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
F/llbracketv/rrbracketF·nFqdF,∀q∈/tildewidePk−1(F),∀F⊂∂K, K∈ Th/bracerightbigg
.
22No essential modiﬁcations of the 2D structure take place in 3D. This is the major advantage of
using the nonconforming version of the method. The 3D version of t he conforming VEM on curved
domains in [10] should involve curved virtual element spaces on faces that are currently unknown.
The construction of the local and global discrete bilinear forms in Se ction 3.2 directly extends
to the 3D case. The only diﬀerence resides in the design of the stabiliz ing term that requires a
diﬀerent scaling. It can be proved that the stabilization
SK(uh,vh) :=Ndof(K)/summationdisplay
l=1hKDl(uh)Dl(vh)∀uh, vh∈Vh(K)
satisﬁes the 3D version of the estimates in (3.11). In fact, the key technical tools in stability
analysis are inverse inequalities, see Lemma 4.1; the Neumann trace in equality, see Lemma 4.2;
polynomial inverse inequalities on the element boundaries, see Lemma 4.3; “direct estimates” such
as Poincar´ e-type and trace-type inequalities. All such bounds ar e valid also in 3D.
The abstract error analysis is dealt with similarly to the 2D case; see T heorems 6.6 and 6.7.
The only minor modiﬁcation is in the deﬁnition of the nonconformity ter m which in 3D is deﬁned
as
Nh(u,v) :=/summationdisplay
F∈E3
h/integraldisplay
F/llbracketv/rrbracketF·∇udF,
whereE3
hdenotes the set of (curved) faces in the polyhedral decompositio n. Thus, the proof of
error estimates for the nonconforming term follows along the same lines as in the 2D case, since
[3, Lemma 4.1] is valid in arbitrary space dimension.
8 Numerical experiments
In this section, we present some numerical experiments, so as to v alidate of Theorems 6.6 and 6.7.
Since the energy and L2errors are not computable, we rather consider the computable er ror
quantities:

The two quantities above convergence with the same rate as the ex act errors |u−uh|1,hand
/ba∇dblu−uh/ba∇dbl0,Ω.
In Section 8.1, we consider two test cases on domains with curved bo undary; in Section 8.2, we
consider a test case with an internal curved interface and curved boundary.
8.1 Curved boundary
As a ﬁrst test case, we consider the domain Ω = {(x,y)|x2+y2<1}, see Figure 8.1 (left-panel)
and the exact (analytic) solution
u1(x,y) = sin(πx)cos(πy).
The function u1has inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions over ∂Ω.
23Figure 8.1: Left-panel: a circular domain Ω. Right-panel: an example of (curved) Voronoi mesh over Ω.
In Figure 8.2, we show the convergenceofthe two errorquantities in (8.1) on the given sequence
of Voronoi meshes with decreasing mesh size; see Figure 8.1 (right- panel) for a sample mesh. We
consider virtual elements of “orders” k= 2, 3, and 4.

Voronoi meshes with decreasing mesh size are employed. The “ orders” of the virtual element spaces are
k= 2, 3, and 4.
As a second test case, we consider the curved domain Ω introduced in [10] and deﬁned as
Ω :={(x,y) s.t 0<x<1,andg1(x)<y<g 2(x)}, (8.2)
where
g1(x) :=1
20sin(πx) andg2(x) := 1+1
20sin(3πx).
We represent the domain in Figure 8.3. On such an Ω, we consider the e xact (analytic) solution
u2(x,y) =−(y−g1(x))(y−g2(x))(1−x)x(3+sin(5x)sin(7y)).
The function u2has homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions over ∂Ω.

Figure 8.4: Left-panel: an example of (curved) Voronoi mesh over Ω. Right-panel: an example of
(curved) quadrilateral mesh over Ω.
The ﬁnite element partition on the curved domain Ω is constructed st arting from a mesh for
the square [0 ,1]2and mapping the nodes accordingly to the following rule:
(xΩ,yΩ) =/braceleftBigg
(xs,ys+g1(xs)(1−2ys)),ifys≤1

(xs,1−ys+g2(xs)(2ys−1),ifys≥1

Above, (xs,ys) denotes the mesh generic node on the square domain (0 ,1)2, and (xΩ,yΩ) denotes
the associated node in the curved domain Ω. The edges on the curve d boundary consist of an arc
of Γ1or Γ2, while all the internal edges are straight. In Figure 8.4, we display tw o examples of
meshes, namely, a (curved) Voronoi and a (curved) square mesh .

Figure 8.5: Left-panels: convergence of EH1. Right-panels: convergence of EL2. The exact solution is u2.
We employ sequences of (curved) Voronoi meshes (ﬁrst row) an d (curved) square meshes (second row)
with decreasing mesh size are employed. The “orders” of the v irtual element spaces are k= 2, 3, and 4.
The theoreticalpredictions ofSection 6 areconﬁrmed: converge nceoforder O(hk) andO(hk+1)
is observed for the energy and L2-type errors in (8.1).
Next, we approximate the curved domain by using a polygonal mesh s equence of elements with
straight edges. Notably, we approximate the curved boundary by straight segments and force
homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions; see Figure 8.6.
In Figure 8.7 we plot the results for the sequence of Voronoi meshe s on the approximated
domain, obtained with the standard nonconforming VEM on polygons .

Figure 8.7: Left-panel: convergence of EH1. Right-panel: convergence of EL2. The exact solution is u2.
Voronoi meshes with decreasing mesh size are employed. The “ orders” of the virtual element spaces are
k= 2, 3.
In this case, we observe that the geometrical error dominates an d the rate of convergence is
approximately 1.5 and 2 for the energy and L2type approximate errors in (8.1).
8.2 Curved interfaces
As a third test case, see [10], we consider the same circular domain Ω w ith boundary Γ 2as in
Section 8.1, and we split into two subdomains Ω 1and Ω 2by an internal interface Γ 1so as Ω 2has
half the radius of Ω; see Figure 8.8 (left-panel). Further, we are giv en a diﬀusion coeﬃcient κand
a loading term fpiecewise deﬁned as
/braceleftBigg
κ= 1 in Ω 1,
κ= 5 in Ω 2,/braceleftBigg
f= 5 in Ω 1,
f= 1 in Ω 2,
We are interested in approximating the solution u2to the elliptic problem
/braceleftBigg
−div(κ∇u) =fin Ω,
u= 0 on Γ 2,
which is given by (here r:=/radicalbig

The function u3is analytic in Ω 1and Ω 2but has ﬁnite Sobolev regularity across the interface Γ 1,
see Figure 8.8).
27Figure 8.8: Left-panel: a circular domain Ω with a curved internal inter face Γ 1. Right-panel: an example
of (curved) mesh conforming with respect to the internal int erface.
In Figure 8.9, we show the convergence of the two quantities in (8.1) on the given sequence
of meshes with decreasing mesh size that are conforming with respe ct to the curved internal
interface Γ 1; see Figure 8.8 (right-panel). We consider virtual elements of “ord er”k= 2, 3, and 4.
