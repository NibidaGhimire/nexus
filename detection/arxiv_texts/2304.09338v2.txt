AbstractInsubmergedsandyslopes,soilisfrequentlyerodedasacombinationoftwomainmechanisms: breaching,
which refers to the retrogressive failure of a steep slope forming a turbidity current, and, instantaneous sliding wedges,
known as shear failure, that also contribute to shape the morphology of the soil deposit. Although there are several
modes of failures, in this paper we investigate breaching and shear failures of granular columns using the two-fluid
approach. The numerical model is first applied to simulate small scale granular column collapses (Rondon et al., 2011)
with different initial volume fractions to study the role of the initial conditions on the main flow dynamics. For loosely
packed granular columns, the porous medium initially contracts and the resulting positive pore pressure leads to a
rapidcollapse. Whereasininitiallydense-packingcolumns,theporousmediumdilatesandnegativeporepressureis

1 Introduction
Althoughgranularflowsareubiquitousinnatureandindustrialapplications, researchersstillstruggletocompletely
understand the underlying physics of such flows. Difficulties arisewhen the granular material interacts with a viscous
fluid: thedeformationofthesoilskeletoninduceschangesonthefluidpressurefieldwhich,subsequently,affectsthe
topology of the soil skeleton. Indeed, the complex inner nature of such flows is the main reason for the absence of
simplified models that describe immersed granular flows.
In this work, we explore the collapse of granular columns immersed in a viscous fluid. Special attention is given to
Rondonetal.(2011),anexperimentalinvestigationoftheroleoftheinitialsolidvolumefractiononthedynamicsofthe
granularcollapse. Rondonetal.(2011)observedthatininitiallyloosepackings,theexcessofporepressurebuiltupand
enhanced a rapid mobility of the granular column, whereas in initially dense granular packings, negative pore pressure
developed within the porous medium increasing the shear resistance and, therefore, delaying the granular collapse. This
mechanism,duetothecontracting/dilatingbehaviorofgranularmaterial,iscommonlyknownasporepressurefeedback
and was first reported by Iverson et al. (1997, 2005) and largely studied experimentally (Iverson et al., 2000; Pailha et
al.,2008;Rondonetal.,2011;Bougouinetal.,2018)andnumerically(Bouchutetal.,2016;Wangetal.,2017;Lee
etal.,2021;Montellàetal.,2021)usingmultipleconfigurationswherethedense/loosegranularmaterialissheared.
Overall, on the collapse of immersed granular columns, literature (Rondon et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2021) distinguishes
two main processes largely linked to the initial volume fraction: on the one hand, initially loose packings lead to shear
failureformingaslidingwedge. Ontheotherhand,densegranularpackingsaremorepronetocollapsethroughthe
breaching mechanism, that is the process of front particles progressively released as a turbidity current while the fluid
penetrates the granular column to enhance the dilation of the medium. Breaching failure carries potential danger in
submerge dense sandy soils. Indeed, Beinssen et al. (2014) have reported multiple large-scale failures due to the breach
face slowly receding from the original position. Even though this paper focus on the breaching and shear plane failures,
itisworthmentioningthatotherfailuremechanisms,suchassoilliquefaction, arealsoinfluencedbydilatancyeffects
(Youd et al., 1973; Prevost et al., 1985). Liquefaction occurs in loose soils where a rapid particle rearrangement leads to
aporepressurebuildupvanishingtheeffectivestress. Structuresonliquefiablesoilsmayhaveterribleconsequences
under earthquakes or other shear induced situations (Koutsourelakis et al., 2002).
Several numerical studies on immersed granular collapses have been reported in the literature. Kumar et al. (2017)
explored the effect of initial volume fraction on the dynamics of 2D granular collapses by means of the Discrete
Element Method (DEM) coupled with the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). Izard et al. (2018) was able to reproduce
three-dimensional granular collapses with an immersed boundary method coupled with DEM. Similarly, Xu et al.
(2019)andYangetal.(2019)reliedonsmoothedparticlehydrodynamics(SPH)-DEMandLBM-DEMapproaches,
respectively, to study the process of submerged granular collapse. Most of previous work is computationally expensive
and time consuming. Thus, affordable simulations are typically restricted to a low number of particles, which limits the
range of applications, especially if one is interested in large-scale applications such as coastal breaching or landslides.
Alternatively, continuum approaches are more suited for large-scale problems but their accuracy highly depends on
the closure models and an adequate coupling between the fluid and the solid phase. On the one hand, the mixture
modelproposedbySavageetal.(2014)wascapableofpredictingtheinitialdynamicsoftheloosegranularcollapse
but less satisfactory results were found for the dense granular collapse. This approach neglected the excess of pore
pressure despite the fact that pore pressure feedback mechanism plays a key role in the collapse. On the other hand,
Bouchutetal.(2017)proposedadepth-averagedapproachtomodelthedilatancyeffectsandporepressurefeedback
mechanismofdifferentsubmergedgranularcollapses. BasedontheEulerian-Eulerianframework,thefirstattempts
by Lee et al. (2015, 2018) to model the intricate dynamics of granular column collapses obtained promising results.
However, such modelsadopted simple elastic relationshipsto determine the solidpressure ignoring the shear-induced
volume changes which led to an insufficient description of the pore pressure feedback. Shi et al. (2021) and Lee et
al.(2021)wentonestepfurtherandproposedmodificationsoftheelasticequationthatcapturedthesheared-induced
volume changes and reproduced the granular collapse dynamics with great success. Previous studies are mainly focused
onthemorphologyofthedepositandtheporepressurefeedbackmechanismofsmall-scalegranularcollapses. Yet,
experimentalstudies(Vanrheeetal.,1999;Vandenbergetal.,2002;Ekeetal.,2011)showthatthebreachingprocess
forming turbidity currents is a crucial mechanism to reproduce practical applications such as dredging engineering
orprotectionmeasuresagainstcoastalerosion(Vandenbergetal.,2002;Beinssenetal.,2014;Shipwayetal.,2015;
Mastbergen et al., 2019). Accordingly, it seems reasonable to upscale the problem and examine whether the collapse is
driven by the same dynamics observed in Rondon’s experiments (Rondon et al., 2011) or, conversely, other physics
apply. Although the studies on breaching are scarce (Vanrhee et al., 1999; You et al., 2012, 2014; Alhaddad et al., 2020;
Weĳetal.,2020;Alhaddadetal.,2023),mostofthelaboratoryexperimentsreportedthatthegranularcolumnsmanifest
a dual mode slope failure. Instead of observing a progressive erosion induced by the turbidity currents of the breaching
process, the evolution of the granular column is governed by a combination of breaching and occasional sliding wedges.
Youetal.(2014)suggeststhatslidefailurestakeplacewhenthenegativeporepressuredevelopedintheporousmedium
2Numerical investigation of mode failures in submerged granular columns
is not enough to keep the shear resistance against slide failure. You et al. (2014) remarked that slides are associated
to a drop in excess of pore pressure, and, the magnitude of the jump is related to the size of the slide. Additionally,
experiments (Lee et al., 2021, 2022) have reported that dense granular packings exhibit shear failure for coarse particles
andbreachingforfineparticle. Itisworthnotingthatexperimentsinvestigatingthebreachingprocessarelimitedinsize
because large-scale experiments are not affordable. Thus, numerical simulations arise as a potential alternative to study
the physics of the breaching process in large-scale applications. Breusers et al. (1977) introduced the concept of active
wallvelocitydefinedasthehorizontalvelocityatwhichsteepslopesmoveduetothebreachingprocess. Sincethen,
several breaching erosion models have been proposed based on different closures for the wall velocity. A quasistatic 1D
depth-averaged approach developed by Mastbergen et al. (2003) was used to investigate the breaching process showing
thatturbiditycurrentscanbestrongenoughtoperiodicallyflushlargedepositsofsedimentsfromcanyons. Ekeetal.
(2011) considered a similar model to study another flushing event in submarine canyons. More recently, Vanrhee et al.
(2015) proposed a 2D drift-flux model based on the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations to study the stability of
the breaching process. Previous studies, nonetheless, are subjected to some limitations. Firstly, current models do not
account for slide failures, and, secondly, they neglect the evolution of soil properties. Therefore, in order to further
investigate the breaching process, numerical models should not only be able to capture the turbidity currents, but also
the transition from static to yielding soil and the effects of the pore pressure feedback.

2 Mathematical formulation
The governing equations for the Eulerian-Eulerian two-phase formulation are shown below alongside with the closure
forms for drag force, turbulence model and stresses for the fluid and particle phases.
2.1 Two-phase flow governing equations
The mass continuity equations for the solid and fluid phase are written as follows:

Here,𝜙,usandufare the solid volume faction, the particle phase velocity and the fluid phase velocity, respectively.
The momentum conservation equations for the solid phase and fluid phase are written as:

This work uses the approach of Engelund (1953) to compute the permeability based on the pressure drop in steady
porous flow:

approaches employed for high packingfractions (such as Ergun (1952)) lies onthe advantage to adjust the factors 𝛼𝐸
and𝛽𝐸to accurately represent the permeability of soils made up of irregular shaped particles.

where𝜙𝑟𝑐𝑝is the random close packing volume fraction. We adopt the value for sphere packings ( 𝜙𝑟𝑐𝑝=0.625). It’s
important to note that Eq. 12 is based on the work of Johnson et al. (1987), which assumes a constant value called the
randomloosepackingfraction( 𝜙𝑟𝑙𝑝insteadof𝜙𝑝𝑙). However,toaccuratelyaccountfortheeffectsofdilatancy,weneed
to consider initial and transient packing fractions that are different from the random loose packing fraction. The initial
volume fraction ( 𝜙𝑜) is calculated as the average volume fraction throughout the height of the bed, which is given by:
𝜙𝑜=1

(2011)) yield initially loose granular packings ( 𝜙𝑜≈0.55).

𝛿=𝐾1(𝜙−𝜙∞), (15)
where𝐾1is a calibration parameter and 𝜙∞stands for the equilibrium volume fraction. As reported by Roux et al.
(1998);Pailhaetal.(2009),thelinearvariationofthedilatancyanglewiththevolumefractionaswritteninEq. 15is
derived from the linerization of the dilation rate:

𝜙∞is modeled as a function of the particle pressure and the shear rate through the viscous number:

where the viscous number ( 𝐼𝑣) is defined as:
𝐼𝑣=𝜌𝑓𝜈𝑓||𝑺𝒔||
𝑝𝑠, (18)
and𝜙𝑐is the critical volume fraction in quastistatic shear ( 𝐼𝑣→0).
In this work 𝛿is limited to a range of −0.4≤𝛿≤0.4which falls into physical values proposed by previous works
(Pouliquenetal.,1996;Iversonetal.,2014;Alshiblietal.,2018). Theinfluenceofthedilatancyprefactor 𝐾1willbe
studied in section 3.1.3.
Eq. 17 suggests that different values of the equilibrium solid volume fraction are expected in transient conditions,
such as the onset of the granular collapse, the fully developed flow and the final arrest. In the context of a granular
column collapse, steady flows are unlikely: viscous forces are expected to slow down the granular flow before it is fully
developed, therefore, dilatancy effects will arise provided that 𝜙≠𝜙∞and||𝑺𝒔||>0. It is noteworthy that despite the
fact the value of 𝜙𝑝𝑙is just a numerical parameter, the consequences of the changes in 𝜙𝑝𝑙are completely physical.
Indeed, this model not only extends the critical state soil mechanics to a rate-dependent critical state ( 𝜙∞) but also
leads to an increase or a decrease of the granular pressure depending on the initial packing and, consequently, to
pressure-driven expansion or compaction of the solid phase under shear conditions. Furthermore, the value of 𝜙𝑝𝑙
remainsunboundedbecauseduringthegranularflowitcannotdecreaseorincreaseindefinitely. Thisisbecauseforloose
materials(low 𝜙𝑝𝑙value),thedilatancycoefficientisnegative,andaccordingtoEq. 14, 𝜙𝑝𝑙mustincrease. Similarly,

In short, dilatancy is a complex physical phenomenon and our approach consists in decomposing its effect into the
enduringcontact pressure 𝑝𝑠
𝑐andthe shear-ratedependant pressure 𝑝𝑠
𝑠. Theformerpressure ( 𝑝𝑠
𝑐)is closelyrelatedto
the microstructure. For instance, in initially dense packings, the particles are interlocking and are not able to move
freely. Therefore, thegrainsneedtoberearrangedtoallowshearingdeformations. Duringthegrainreorganization,
the contacts become stronger which comes with an increment of the enduring contact pressure 𝑝𝑠
𝑐. The shear-rate

mediumdilateswhenincreasingtheshearrate( 𝐼𝑣↑)whichisaccompaniedbyanincrementofthesolidpressurethat
scales with the fluid viscosity and the shear-rate.
Jop et al. (2006) proposed that the ratio between shear stress and pressure can be scaled by the inertial number,
𝐼=𝑑||𝑺𝒔||√
𝑝𝑠/𝜌𝑠, defined as the ratio between the macro and micro time scale of granular flow. Cassar et al. (2005) followed
asimilarapproachusingtheviscousnumber 𝐼𝑣tomodelgranularflowsimmersedinviscousfluids. Eventhoughthe
present work utilizes the viscous number 𝐼𝑣because the analyzed granular collapses are found to be in the viscous
regime (the Stokes number 𝑆𝑡=𝜌𝑠𝑑2||𝑺𝒔||
𝜌𝑓𝜈𝑓ranges from 𝑆𝑡=0.005to𝑆𝑡=0.3depending on the granular collapse),
different scenarios or real large-scale events, where the rheology belongs to an inertial regime rather than a viscous
regime, may be studied with the present numerical model simply adapting the constitutive laws for the inertial number 𝐼
as reported by Montellà et al. (2021).

3 Results
In this section, the two-phase flow model is used to reproduce initially loose and dense granular column collapses. The
first part of this section consists of reproducing Rondon et al. (2011) granular collapses. Although, a broad number of
works(Wangetal.,2017;Izardetal.,2018;Jingetal.,2019;Sunetal.,2020;Mengetal.,2021;Riffardetal.,2022;
Polanía et al., 2022) have predicted the main features of granular column collapses immersed in a viscous fluid, only a
few (Wang etal., 2017;Yangetal., 2020)havesuccessfully capturedthedynamics ofRondon’sexperiments forboth
initiallyloose anddensegranularcolumns, andevenfewer, havedoneitwithacontinuumapproach(Bouchutetal.,

The dilatancy model presented herein was able to capture the pore pressure feedback in 1D and 2D granular avalanches
(Montellà et al., 2021) with reasonably good agreement. The granular column collapse is, thus, used to extend the
modeltoamorecomplexandrealisticconfiguration. Additionally,asensitivityanalysisissummarizedinthissectionto

3.1 Collapse of a granular column - Rondon’s experiments
TheexperimentsperformedbyRondonetal.(2011)investigatedthecollapseofagranularcolumninaviscousliquid.
Initially dense columns resulted in negative pore pressures that slowed down the collapse, while in loose granular
packings, the collapsing process was triggered instantaneously with positive pore pressures that enhanced a rapid
flow. Although several volume fractions and aspect ratios were analyzed, only two representative cases (an initially
loose column with 𝜙𝑜≈0.55and an initially dense packing with 𝜙𝑜≈0.61) will be considered in this work. The
experimental setup consisted of a tank with a length of 0.7𝑚, and a width and height of 0.15𝑚. A removable gate was
placed vertically and glass beads were poured behind the gate. The rest of the physical and geometrical parameters have
been taken from Rondon et al. (2011) (see table 3). During the experiments, the excess of pore pressure was measured
at the bottom at 2𝑐𝑚from the left side of the tank. The numerical setup is presented in figure 1. The numerical domain
is decomposed into square cells of 0.41𝑚𝑚×0.41𝑚𝑚.

3.1.1 Morphology
Figure 2 shows the evolution of the deposit shapes during the granular column collapses. As reported by Rondon et al.
(2011), the dynamics of the granular column collapse are very different depending on the initial volume fraction: initial
densegranularpackingsaremobilizedslowlyandshowshortrun-outdistances(seefigure2a). Onthecontrary,initially
loose granular packings are characterized by a rapid flow and elongated fronts (see figure 2b).
In addition to the dynamics of the granular flow, dilatancy effects are also illustrated in figures 2 as changes in the solid
volumefraction. Theshearedregioninfigure2aisexpandingprogressivelyfrom 𝜙0≈0.61to𝜙≈0.57. Conversely,

concentration along a straight line displayed in figure 2b for the loose granular collapse. This line splits the moving and
the static regions, and it’s commonly referred to as the failure line. The collapse of the upper right part of the column is
triggered right after the gate is removed. The sliding region is contracting more rapidly close to the bottom and the
failure line because the shear rate is higher near the non-moving regions (the variable 𝜙𝑝𝑙embedding the dilatancy
effects is proportional to the shear rate - see Eq. 14). The failure line and the fluid velocity field are also visualized
infigure3. Asmentionedbefore,onlytheslidingwedgeismovingsignificantly,hencecontracting. Thisleadstoan
expansion along the failure line to ensure the conservation of mass. Figure 3c illustrates the dilation rate as defined by
Iverson et al. (2014), i.e. the divergence of the solid phase velocity ( ∇·us) so we can distinguish the contractancy and
dilatancy regions. After the gate removal 𝜙𝑝𝑙increases along the failure line. According to Eq. 12, the contact pressure
is reduced, therefore, a reduction of the shear strength is expected enhancing a rapid flow slide. As the collapse carries
on, the contractancy behavior of the sheared region entails an increment of the volume fraction, which according to Eq.
12, is accompanied by an increase of the contact pressure. Figures 2b and 3 also show a mild expansion within the
non-movingregion. Onemaywonderwhytheso-callednon-movingregionisdeformingifwedefineditasstaticregion.
Itisworthmentioningthattheexpansionofthestaticregionismainlycausedbythereductionofthecolumnheightand
its subsequent decompression. As a matter of fact, the expansion rate of this region is significantly low ( ∇·usvalues in
figure3c are∇·us≈0.004𝑠−1whereas∇·us≈−0.020𝑠−1insidethe contractingband). The gentleexpansionof the
static region is accompanied by an inward flux (see figure 3c) that occupies the growing pore space.

time scales and remarkably similar run-out distances. Although, there is an undeniable resemblance between the
numerical and the experimental final deposits, figure 2 suggests that the numerical solution for the dense collapse leads

to a milder final slope compared to the experimental data and the loose case is slightly slower during the first moments
after the gate removal.
3.1.2 Excess of pore pressure
Figure 4a shows that negative pore pressure develops, stabilizing the dense granular material. The initial vertical

is triggered. Under such circumstances, the granular material dilates, pore bodies are enlarged and the fluid phase

increasing the effective strength, and overall, stabilizing the granular material. The negative pore pressure is, therefore,
responsible for the characteristic creeping flow observed in figures 2a and 4a.
The loose scenario portrayed in figure 4b shows a dual positive/negative pore pressure map revealing the complex
dynamicsofthecollapse. Thecontractingbehavioroftheshearedregioncomesalongwithanexpulsionofthepore
fluid. Therefore, positive pore pressure develops within the moving area reducing the shear resistance and enhancing a
rapid granular flow. As mentioned before, dilation also occurs in the loose collapse along the failure line (see figure 3c).
Subsequently, the fluid is sucked into the failure line and partially into the non-moving region due to its decompression

along the failure line decreases inducing a reduction of the solid pressure (see Eq. 12), thus a lower shear-strength. As a

along the failure line, the shearing region is partially fluidized and the lower effective stress is accompanied by a rapid

3.1.3 Sensitivity study
This section summarizes the role of different parameters on the dynamics of the granular collapse. Figures on the
sensitivityanalysisareprovidedassupplementarymaterial. Theresultsofthesensitivitystudywereusedtofindthe
optimal set of parameters to reproduce Rondon’s experiments numerically.
𝐾1sensitivity
The dilatancy prefactor 𝐾1introduced in Eq.15 is responsible for controlling the plastic effects that arise from particle
rearrangementsduringsheardeformations. Fromtheresultsshowninthesupplementarymaterialforthedensecase,we
observe that large 𝐾1values result in slightly slower creeping flow while the final deposit shape is unaltered. Dilatancy
is relevant right after the gate removal, then, dilatancy effects fade out and the granular collapse starts flowing after
𝑡≈6𝑠as it would flow at the equilibrium state ( 𝜙=𝜙∞), eventually, reaching the same deposit shape regardless of the
𝐾1value. Numerical results show that the dense granular collapse follows very similar dynamics for both 𝐾1=4(value
proposedinMontellàetal.(2021))and 𝐾1=40(referencevalueinthisarticle). The 𝐾1=4scenarioprovidesaslightly
faster collapse but a better pore pressure dissipation curve matching the experimental points with striking accuracy.
Concerning the loose case, supplementary material illustrates increasing 𝐾1has a strong effect on the dynamics of the
spreading deposit. According to Eq.14 and Eq.15 , the increment of 𝐾1is responsible for 𝜙𝑝𝑙to increase more rapidly.
Microscopically, it means contact forces are reduced more abruptly leading to a lower solid pressure and shear strength.
Consequently,large 𝐾1valuesenhancearapidflowwithlongerrun-outdistances. Adopting 𝐾1=4fortheloosecaseis

(𝐾1=100) reveals a high positive pore pressure jump. However, the morphology of the deposit remains barely affected.

𝛿values decay suppressing the dilatancy effect.

strain. Further research could explore the use of non-linear dilatancy laws and perform DEM simulations to improve or
introduce new phenomenological expressions to predict the effects of dilatancy with even greater accuracy.
𝜙𝑐sensitivity
The influence of the critical volume fraction ( 𝜙𝑐) is closely linked to the dilatancy effects. According to Eq. 14
and Eq. 17, dilatancy effects are proportional to 𝜙−𝜙𝑐/(1+𝐼1/2
𝑣). Therefore, assuming lower 𝜙𝑐values result in
lower contractancy effects for initially loose cases and stronger dilatancy effects for initially dense packings (see figure
in the supplementary material). Likewise, larger 𝜙𝑐values are associated to weaker dilatancy in dense cases and
enhanced contractancy for loose granular columns. Changes in 𝜙𝑐are remarkably more important in the loose packings.
Contractancy effects partially fluidize the granular column, which leads to rapid collapse with a final deposit of a very
gentle slope. Correspondingly, the pore pressure dynamics are significantly higher for the loose case. In particular,
the𝜙𝑐=0.58casereproducesthemagnitudeofthepositiveporepressurejumpreportedintheexperiments. Onthe
contrary, minor differences in terms of pore pressure are observed for the scenarios with initially dense columns.

terms of excess pore pressure and deposit spreading response. It is important to note that the numerical simulations in
this study are conducted under a dense viscous granular flow regime. Therefore, it is not surprising that the contact
pressure has a much greater impact compared to the shear-induced pressure. In the dense scenario 𝐾2=1poses
numerical stability issues that require a smaller time step. Thus, 𝐾2=0.01is preferred for the dense granular collapse
to circumvent numerical instabilities.
Elastic modulus
This section explores the influence of the elastic modulus ( 𝐸) of Eq. 12 on the granular collapse dynamics. Before
getting into the discussion, it is pertinent to note that 𝐸values used in the present numerical model are considerably far
from real materials such as glass beads ( 𝐸≈70𝐺𝑃𝑎) or sand (𝐸∈[5−80]𝑀𝑃𝑎), however, these values would induce
numerical issues with the non-linear approach of Eq. 12. Instead, 𝐸values used in the present sensitivity analysis

The friction coefficient (see Eq.22) has a certain effect on the shape of the deposit. Large friction coefficients delay the
collapse and the deposit ends up with a steeper slope. The lower mobilization entails a weaker pore pressure feedback:
the soil is more difficult to shear, thus, pore volume changes take longer. Conversely, low fiction angles promote a rapid
failure with abrupt pore volume changes, therefore, higher pore pressure jumps are observed.
Discussion on the sensitivity study
Inthis workwehave optimizedthe setofparameters basedon theshapeof thedeposit. The sensitivityanalysisof the
presentsectionrevealsthatadifferentset( 𝜙𝑐↑,𝐾1↑and𝜇𝑠↓)woulddefinitelyprovideabetterporepressureprediction

(except for𝜙𝑐=0.58) presented in the sensitivity analysis reaches the positive pore pressure developed within the
loose granular column. Several factors could explain the underprediction of the positive pore pressure curve: 1) results
are very sensitive to the initial volume fraction. Indeed, Lee et al. (2021) reported different 𝑝𝑓−𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒curves and
deposit shapes for a narrow range of initial concentrations: 𝜙𝑜=0.553and𝜙𝑜=0.550. 2) Measurement imprecisions
and external factors inherent to the experiment may not be completely modeled in the numerical simulations. For
instance, free surface perturbations could be induced at the moment of gate removal and/or rapid collapse of the loose
column. Such perturbations may increase the pore pressure and partially fluidize the granular column. Rondon et
al. (2011) claimed that wall effects are negligible, however, the fluid flowing through the porous medium may have

their slow collapse and the presence of negative pore pressures that stabilize the soil. At larger scales, it is also possible
to observe the breaching process. As described in section 3.1, dilatancy induces negative pore pressure that reduce the
shearing preventing a shear failure. However, near the front face, particles are released due to the expansion of the
granular material causing the breach front to slowly regress.
In this section, the laboratory experimental data provided by Weĳ et al. (2020); Alhaddad et al. (2023) are used to
evaluate the accuracy of the present numerical model to predict the breaching process. The experimental setup of Weĳ

3.2.2 Dynamics of breaching
The removal of the gate triggers an initial creeping phase. The low mobility of the column is associated to the negative
pore pressure measured with the sensors. Depending on the type of sand, different dynamics are observed.

well captured by the numerical model, however, slight discrepancies are found near the right top corner, where the
numerical model predicts a rounded shape rather than a sharp corner observed in the experiments. The final shape
consists of a deposit with a slope around 20𝑜modeled by SedFoam with remarkable agreement.
A key feature of the breaching process is the turbidity current formed near the front face as the particles are slowly
released and pulled down by gravity. Such currents are illustrated in figure 7a and become less intense with time. Some

angle in which the material is at rest with no turbidity current.
The negative pore pressure plays the role of stabilizing the column and contributes to delay the granular flow. Figure 7b
shows a pore pressure map very similar to the Rondon’s granular collapse studied in section 3.1. The negative pore
pressure is significantly higher in the right top region of the granular column, where the material is more likely to
fail along a shear plane. On the one hand, the negative pore pressure is responsible for a higher shear strength that
keeps the granular column as a whole without shear failures. On the other hand, the dense material at the top right
area is expanding which enhances the turbidity currents previously discussed. As the pore pressure dissipates, the
shearresistanceisreducedandtheshearstressmayreachtheyieldpointformingashearfailureplane. Thissituation
wasreportedinafewexperiments(Weĳetal.,2020)whereoccasionalshearslidefailureswereobservedduringthe
breaching process. When slides occur, small drops in the excess of pore pressure are measured by the pressure sensors
near the shear plane. In particular, the pressure drops located at 𝑡≈80𝑠and𝑡≈125𝑠could have caused two successive
minor slides in the experiments as shown in figure 7c. These slides erode the front face much faster than the breaching
process. Nonetheless, no sliding failures were observed in the numerical situations for the GEBA sand where the
receding front face was mainly conducted by the breaching process. In the numerical simulations, figure 7 shows a pore

comparable with the experimental ones.
The experiment and numerical simulations using the D9 sand show a similar trend, yet, slightly different dynamics are
observed in the experiments. The larger permeability of the D9 sand (grains roughly three times larger than the GEBA
sand and lower initial volume fraction) leads to a faster breaching process. In figure 8a the evolution of the deposit

observed in figure 8a, in the experiments, the initial breaching process is followed by a slow sliding failure. This feature
is not captured by the numerical model. The dual mode failure , including the breaching process and punctual shear
failure, is evidenced in figure 8b. Initially, the negative pore pressure builds up within the granular material stabilizing

pressure. At 𝑡≈18𝑠, the negative pore pressure is no longer capable to counteract the shear forces, therefore, a wedge
close to the breaching face starts sliding down. Simultaneously, the sliding region increases the shear rate significantly,
especially near the failure line, which is accompanied by a negative pore pressure build up (second minimum point in
8b). Incontrast tothe experimental measurements,the numericalapproach is unableto reproducethisparticular dual
mode failure .
4 Conclusion
Thepresentarticlestudiedtheslidingandbreachingfailuresfordifferentgranularcolumns. Inafirstseriesofnumerical
tests, the model showed to be able to reproduce the experimental data of Rondon et al. (2011) with a reasonable
agreement. We showed that dilatancy effects are crucial to reproduce the rapid collapse of initially loose columns
and the low mobility of initially dense columns. Additionally, the plastic effects embedded in the present dilatancy
model are a key feature to predict the consequent pore pressure feedback mechanism signified by negative pore pressure
for the dense case and positive pore pressure in the loose columns. The results presented in the sensitivity analysis
suggest that dilatancy effects intensify with large 𝐾1values or with the choice of 𝜙𝑐values far from the actual volume
fraction. Concerning the basal pore pressure, little sensitivity to the dilatancy effects ( 𝐾1and𝜙𝑐) is found for the
initially dense column. However, the influence of dilatancy effects is much stronger for the loose case. Indeed, large 𝐾1
or𝜙𝑐values lead to a partially fluidized bed. In such cases, some regions of the column exhibit high positive pore
pressures that counterbalance the gravitational forces and the mixture flows easily until the pore pressure has dissipated
so the shear strength builds up again. Although the model provided fairly good agreement with the experiments
capturing the dilatancy effects at the grain scale through the dilatancy model proposed by Montellà et al. (2021) and the
expansion/contractionofthegranularmediumgovernedby 𝜙(𝐼)(seeEq. 17),improvementsonthedilatancymodel

For the second experimental configuration, the breaching process of Weĳ et al. (2020) was numerically reproduced
with very good agreement. The present numerical model was able to reproduce the breaching process with great

20Numerical investigation of mode failures in submerged granular columns
A Supplementary material: Sensitivity analysis
The present sensitivity analysis provides a better understanding of the mechanisms that may affect the dynamics of the
granular column collapse when some of the soil properties or numerical parameters are deliberately modified.
A.1𝐾1sensitivity
Figure 9 displays the influence of 𝐾1values on the collapse dynamics. We observe relatively small differences between
𝐾1=40and𝐾1=100duetothedilatancycoefficient( 𝛿)restrictedtotherange −0.4≤𝛿≤0.4. Afterthegateremoval,
both𝐾1=40and𝐾1=100scenariosreachthelimit |𝛿|=0.4insomeregionsofthegranularcolumn,thus,norelevant
differenceisobservedbetween 𝐾1=40and𝐾1=100. Asweapproachtheequilibriumstate, 𝛿valuesdecaysuppressing
the dilatancy effect, though in the 𝐾1=100case, dilatancy effects are mildly higher during the 𝜙→𝜙∞transition.
The loose case displayed in figure 9 shows 𝐾1has a stronger effect on the dynamics of the spreading deposit. Large 𝐾1
valuesenhancearapidflowwithlongerrun-outdistancesbecausepositiveporepressuredevelopswithinthegranular
medium (see the positive pressure jumps in figure 9) reducing the shear strength of the system.

positive overshoot of pore pressure for the initially loose column but dilatancy effects fluidize a significant region of the
granular column, which leads to a deposit shape that resembles a horizontal sediment layer. Regarding the dense case,
the negative pore pressure is overpredicted, the expansion of the granular column occurs extremely rapid, so dilatancy
effectsgofromanimmediatelargeimpacttoanirrelevantcontributionintheearlystages. Thisresultsinagranular
collapse that flows normally without dilatancy effects. At this point, it is worth noting that in most of literature (Pailha
et al., 2009; Mutabaruka et al., 2014), the dilatancy prefactor 𝐾1is found to be in the range of 𝐾1∈[1−50].

region between the two probes results. The influence of 𝐾1is investigated.
One may think, following the logic of the dilatancy model presented in this work, that the pore pressure jump is higher
because we are enhancing a rapid granular flow accompanied with contractancy, thus, a reduction of the pore space
thatresultsinpositiveporepressure. However,thepressurejumpisnotonlyinfluencedbythistransition,instead,the
dynamics of the sliding failure and spreading are even more important. The fact that the shear strength is reduced more
rapidly with increasing 𝐾1displaces the failure line quickly and the non-moving zone (where zero or negative pore
pressures are observed - see figure 4b) is getting smaller much faster. The consequences of this mechanism are a more
elongatedbed,asmoregranularmaterialismobilized,andpositiveporepressuresmeasuredattheprobelocationwhich
is now placed under the sliding region.
A.2𝜙𝑐sensitivity
The influence of the critical volume fraction ( 𝜙𝑐) is displayed in figure 10. By changing the value of the critical
volume fraction one can adjust the dilatancy effects. Eq. 15 and Eq. 17 show dilatancy effects are proportional to
𝜙−𝜙𝑐/(1+𝐼1/2
𝑣). Therefore,asshowninfigure10,lower 𝜙𝑐valuesresultinlowercontractancyeffectsforinitially
loosecases(thegap 𝜙−𝜙𝑐/(1+𝐼1/2
𝑣)isreduced)andstrongerdilatancyeffectsforinitiallydensepackings(thegap
𝜙−𝜙𝑐/(1+𝐼1/2
𝑣)is increased). Likewise, larger 𝜙𝑐values are associated to weaker dilatancy in dense cases and

enhanced contractancy for loose granular columns. Changes in 𝜙𝑐are remarkably more important in the loose packings.
Indeed, contractancy effects can fluidize a significant region of the granular column, which leads to a deposit shape
closer to a horizontal sediment layer. Correspondingly, the pore pressure dynamics are significantly higher for the loose
case. In particular, the 𝜙𝑐=0.58case reproduces the magnitude of the positive pore pressure jump reported in the
experiments. On the contrary, minor differences in terms of pore pressure are observed for initially dense columns.
A.3𝐾2sensitivity
Figure11illustratesthenegligibleeffectof 𝐾2onthedynamicsofthegranularcolumncollapse. Theshear-induced
pressure remains residual and the collapse is controlled by changes in the contact pressure. Besides, the dense collapse
simulation conducted using 𝐾2=1evidences undesirable numerical fluctuations that compromise the accuracy of the
results, thus, additional relaxation is required to complete the numerical simulations with satisfactory results.
A.4 Influence of elastic modulus
Figure 12 shows profiles and pore pressure curves for two different elastic modulus ( 𝐸) exhibiting limited differences.
However,thesedifferencesarenotsolelyduetothestiffnessofthesoil,butratherthedifferentverticalconcentration
profilesthatresultfromusingvariouselasticmodulus. Indeed, figure13providesevidencethatusingdifferentelastic
modulus values leads to different initial concentration profiles after the sedimentation.
The solid volume fraction is determined after the sedimentation process, where granular material settles under its own
weight. Since we use an expression to model the granular pressure based on the volume fraction (see Eq. 12), once the
sedimentationiscomplete,theweightofthegranularlayerisbalancedbythecontactpressure. Thisimpliesthatwe

obtainalithostaticgranularpressure,whichcanonlybeachievedwithanon-constantvolumefractionprofile. High
values of𝐸result in steep concentration profiles, which are more realistic. However, numerical instabilities arise when
𝐸exceeds 100𝑃𝑎. It is worth noting that for 𝐸=100𝑃𝑎, very small changes in the volume fraction are observed
between the top andbottom of the granular layer. As a consequenceof the non-uniform vertical concentration profile,
the upper regions tend to behave as a looser material than the layers located below. This behavior is accentuated for the
loose case with 𝐸=0.1𝑃𝑎(see figures 12 and 13) where the difference in the initial concentration between the top and
bottomgranularlayerisaround Δ𝜙=𝜙𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚−𝜙𝑡𝑜𝑝≈0.04. Therefore, itisunsurprisingthattheporepressurevalues
registered at the bottom for the loose case using 𝐸=0.1𝑃𝑎are shifted downwards (only negative values are predicted)
because that region is denser than the one corresponding to the 𝐸=100𝑃𝑎case.
A.5 Influence of permeability
In order to study the role of permeability, Engelund’s coefficients in Eq. 5 are increased to lower the permeability of the
granular material. More precisely, 𝛼𝐸=1500and𝛽𝐸=780are considered. Figure 14 shows lower permeabilities lead
to a slow mobilization. In turns, the pressure dissipation takes longer as expected. Furthermore, figure 14 suggests

granular columns.
B Supplementary material: Mesh convergence test
Adopting different mesh sizes in the numerical model has a strong influence on the accuracy of the results. In this
analysis,threemeshsizesareconsidered. Figure16ashowstheamountofroundingobservedatthetopofthebreach
wall is highly dependent on the grid size, with more rounding observed for larger grid cells and sharper corners for
finer meshes. The time series displayed in figure 16a also evidences an increment of the wall velocity as grid cells
become larger. Finally, figure 16b shows larger pressure jumps are predicted as the grid size increases. Moreover, pore
pressure is dissipated more rapidly for coarser meshes. The same pattern was reported by Weĳ et al. (2020). The mesh
refinement study displayed in figure 16 is not converged, however, finer meshes render the computation unfeasible for
realistic simulations. In spite of the evident discrepancies in the pore pressure curves observed in figure 16b, the shape
