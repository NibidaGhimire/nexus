We show that collective multiphonon states in atomic nuclei emerge at high excitation energies
when quantum fluctuations in the collective space are included beyond the independent-particle
approximation. The quadrupole response of a nucleus is studied using an extension of the nuclear
time-dependent density-functional theory that mixes several many-body trajectories. While a single
trajectory can account for the excitation of the first collective quantum, the second and the third
quanta emerge due to the interference between trajectories. The collective spectrum, found as nearly
harmonic, is in excellent agreement with the experimentally observed three quanta of the isoscalar
giant quadrupole resonance in40Ca. This study offers guidance for multiphonon searches in other
self-bound systems and demonstrates the resistance to internal excitation of finite Fermi liquids.
I. INTRODUCTION
The response to an external perturbation is a power-
ful and versatile tool for studying properties of quantum
many-body systems [1]. A recurrent feature of these sys-
tems is the capacity of particles to self-organize into a
collective motion, leading to the occurrence of phonons
in quantum solids [2, 3] and plasmons in electron gases
[4]. Such collectivity survives even in systems with a
much smaller number of particles, like in metallic clus-
ters where the electronic clouds exhibit collective motion
with respect to the ions [5], or in self-bound finite sys-
tems like atomic nuclei where the so-called giant reso-
nances (GRs) have been studied for decades [6–8]. A
convenient framework for understanding the dynamics of
quantum liquids is the time-dependent density-functional
theory (TDDFT) [9–15]. In the linear-response regime
of TDDFT [14, 16], the GRs represent the first harmonic
quantum of quasibosonic excitations. Based on this pic-
ture, it is expected that higher oscillatory quanta, the so-
called multiphonon states, should exist as well [17, 18].
After several decades of research, the existence of two-
phonon GRs in several nuclei has been established using
multiple experimental techniques, including the heavy-
ion inelastic scattering at intermediate or relativistic en-
ergies and the pion double charge exchange reactions [19–
27]. An exciting case is the40Ca nucleus where, in addi-
tion to a two-phonon state [26, 27], an experimental sig-
nature of a three-phonon state was reported as well [28].
Such multiphonon states built from the collective motion
of valence electrons have also been probed in metallic
∗pmarevic@phy.hrclusters [29–31]. Despite these efforts, the experimen-
tal signatures of multiphonon states in finite quantum
systems are scarce, and many questions remain open re-
garding their stability against internal disorder, particle
emissions, or even how they emerge from a microscopic
picture.
A difficulty for microscopic modeling of multiphonon
excitations is the fact that the TDDFT motion reduces to
a quasiclassical evolution of the one-body degrees of free-
dom [17, 32], leading to a large underestimation of quan-
tum fluctuations in the collective space. Even though the
oscillations of TDDFT densities may contain some signa-
tures of a second phonon [33], the small amplitude limit of
TDDFT gives only an access to the first quantum of col-
lective state. Higher excitation quanta can then be gener-
ated by an ad hoc introduction of phonon degrees of free-
dom through, for example, the boson mapping method
[34, 35] or the quasiparticle-phonon model [36, 37]. Alter-
natively, a model can be explicitly requantized through,
for example, a semiclassical quantization of periodic or-
bitals [17, 38] or the fully quantum configuration mixing
method [39–42]. Today, the latter approaches typically
employ bases of time-independent many-body states [43]
chosen on the adiabatic energy landscape, although a few
attempts leveraging time-dependent bases have been re-
cently made within schematic models [44, 45]. As demon-
strated by TDDFT, collective excitations can hardly be
reconciled with the adiabatic assumption unless an enor-
mous number of states is used.
In this work, the method discussed in Refs. [44, 46] is
extended and applied to realistic modeling of nuclear dy-
namics. The TDDFT evolution is requantized through
the mixing of several TDDFT trajectories. By applying
the model to the case of GRs in the40Ca nucleus, it is
demonstrated that the collective multiphonon excitationsarXiv:2304.07380v2  [nucl-th]  9 Aug 20232

emerge naturally in the collective response and their ori-
gin is attributed to the influence of quantum fluctuations
in the collective space.
II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
The basic ingredient of our method is the nuclear
TDDFT, which is considered the most advanced micro-
scopic approach to small and large amplitude nuclear mo-
tion beyond the adiabatic limit [11, 47]. While a single
TDDFT trajectory is rather predictive for the motion of
one-body observables, it largely underestimates quantum
fluctuations in the collective space that are beyond the
independent-particle approximation. Significant efforts
have been made to include fluctuations via phase-space
methods [48, 49] using independent TDDFT trajectories.
Even though such approaches account for quantum fluc-
tuations, a genuine quantization in the collective space
is required to describe the quantum interference between
trajectories.
Based on the well-known static generator coordinate
method (GCM) [39, 40], a natural way to re-quantize
the collective nuclear motion is to write the many-body
wave function as
|Ψ(t)⟩=X
qfq(t)|Φq(t)⟩, (1)
where {|Φq(t)⟩}represents a set of time-dependent Slater
determinants labeled by a vector of collective coordinates
q. The many-body state of (1) is formally equivalent
to the one used in quantum chemistry within the so-
called multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock
(MC-TDHF) framework [50–52]. In MC-TDHF, the tra-
jectories are orthogonal to each other and their evolu-
tion follows a coupled set of TDHF equations. However,
two distinctions in the nuclear case need to be made:
(i) the starting point of our calculation is the nuclear
TDDFT based on phenomenological nuclear energy den-sity functionals (NEDFs) [15, 16], (ii) the set of generat-
ing states {|Φq(t)⟩}is typically non-orthogonal, render-
ing the practical implementation significantly more com-
plex. For these reasons, the nuclear model presented here
will be referred to as the multiconfigurational TDDFT
(MC-TDDFT).
To overcome the difficulties listed above that are par-
ticular to the nuclear case, and following the work of
Refs. [44, 46], we assume here that each state in Eq. (1)
follows its own TDDFT trajectory, that is
iℏ˙ρq(t) =h
h[ρq(t)], ρq(t)i
, (2)
where ρq(t) is the one-body density matrix correspond-
ing to |Φq(t)⟩andh[ρq(t)] is the single-particle Hamilto-
nian deduced from an effective interaction [15, 16]. The
mixing coefficients fq(t), that account for quantum inter-
ference between trajectories, are determined through the
Dirac-Frenkel variational principle which requires that
the action
S=Zt1
t0dt⟨Ψ(t)|ˆH−iℏ∂t|Ψ(t)⟩ (3)
is stationary with respect to variation of the state (1). By
treating the mixing coefficients as variational parameters
we obtain
iℏ˙g=h
N−1/2(H − D )N−1/2+iℏ˙N1/2N−1/2i
g.(4)
Here, Nqq′(t) = ⟨Φq(t)|Φq′(t)⟩corresponds to the
overlap kernel, while Hqq′(t) = ⟨Φq(t)|ˆH|Φq′(t)⟩is
the Hamiltonian kernel whose density-dependent part
is calculated with the average density prescription
[15]. Finally, the derivative kernel reads Dqq′(t) =
⟨Φq(t)|iℏ∂t|Φq′(t)⟩. The normalized collective wave func-
tion, gq(t) =P
q′N1/2
qq′(t)fq′(t), are determined by the
numerical solution of Eq. (4) and can be used to calculate
the expectation value of any observable.
The present framework is similar in spirit to the time-
dependent generator coordinate method (TDGCM) [43]
whose adiabatic realization is particularly popular in fis-
sion studies [53]. However, a major difference is that MC-
TDDFT automatically incorporates the nonadiabatic ef-
fects by considering TDDFT trajectories. Consequently,
we expect a drastic reduction in the number of generat-
ing states as compared with the adiabatic TDGCM, even
if relatively high internal excitation energies are consid-
ered. Figure 1 illustrates the essential concepts of the
MC-TDDFT approach to the quantum many-body dy-
namics.

a detailed performance analysis will be reported else-
where. Dynamics of the40Ca nucleus is simulated in
a three-dimensional box of length L= 24 fm, with a
regular mesh of 14 cells in each spatial direction and a
finite element basis of third-order polynomials. We use
the SLy4d NEDF [57] which is particularly well suited
for nuclear dynamics studies. Starting from the NEDF
ground state |Φ1(0)⟩, different configurations can be ob-
tained by applying the isoscalar quadrupole boost oper-
ator exp ( iλˆQ20), where ˆQ20is the quadrupole operator
andλis the boost amplitude [11, 58]. For this study, we
choose a minimal mixed state of the form (1) with q=
1,2,3, where |Φ2(0)⟩and|Φ3(0)⟩are quadrupole-boosted
states with the excitation energies of about 0 .25 and 0 .50
MeV, respectively. These configurations are chosen so
that the basis of generating states is not overly linearly
dependent. To study the isoscalar giant quadrupole res-
onance (GQR), the entire mixture is perturbed with a
common boost of λ= 5.7×10−3fm−2and left to evolve
in time. The time step of ∆ t= 5×10−25s was verified to
provide well-converged results. The mixing coefficients
were set to f1(0) = 1 and f2(0) = f3(0) = 0 so that
the initial state corresponds to a single Slater determi-
nant while the interference with other trajectories kicks
in during time evolution.
Figure 2(a) shows the response of the40Ca nucleus to
the isoscalar quadrupole boost, either assuming no in-terference (a single TDDFT trajectory) or when the in-
terference is taken into account (the MC-TDDFT case).
Given that the oscillation period of GRs is typically of
the order of 10−22s [17], the nuclear dynamics is simu-
lated up to t= 3×10−21s. The TDDFT curve exhibits
almost harmonic oscillations with a single frequency, con-
sistently with what is usually observed within TDDFT
when the Landau damping effect is absent [1, 7, 9]. Note
that the other two TDDFT trajectories (not shown) yield
similar oscillations with slightly larger amplitudes.
On the other hand, the q20(t) evolution of the MC-
TDDFT state is markedly more complex, with the emer-
gence of both lower and higher new frequencies. Such
beating of collective modes is seen even more clearly in
the corresponding fluctuations, shown in Fig. 2(b). While
fluctuations in the TDDFT case have rather modest am-
plitudes and oscillate with the same frequency as q20(t),
the MC-TDDFT fluctuations exhibit significantly larger
amplitudes and include the beating of various frequen-
cies.
A quantitative analysis of the quadrupole response can
be made using the Fourier transform method. The exci-
tation spectrum of GRs is calculated as
|c(E)|=Z∞
0dtq20(t)f(Γ0, t) exp
iE
ℏt,(5)
where the damping function f(Γ0, t) is a conventional
way to account for the fact that time evolution can be
simulated only up to finite times. In practice, we used
a Gaussian damping which ensures a good resolution of
individual peaks. The form of the Gaussian is such that
it is equivalent to the standard exponential decay with
the same Γ 0= 1.5 MeV parameter.
In Figure 3(a), we show the normalized |c(E)|obtained
from the TDDFT and the MC-TDDFT quadrupole re-
sponses. The TDDFT curve exhibits one peak centered
at about ETDDFT = 17 .8 MeV, in agreement with the
classical oscillator picture. Of course, the peak energy
may slightly differ for other Skyrme parametrizations.
Note that the other two TDDFT trajectories used in MC-
TDDFT yield essentially indistinguishable curves, as ex-
pected in the small oscillations limit. As could be antici-
pated from Fig. 2(a), the MC-TDDFT once again yields
a markedly richer structure. In particular, the main GR
peak is slightly shifted and it gets fragmented with an-
other peak at about 4 MeV higher energy. Experimen-
tally, the existence of the isoscalar GQR in40Ca in the
EGR≈18 MeV region has long been established [59–
67]. Moreover, a fragmentation of the main peak with a
secondary contribution at about 3 .5 MeV lower energy
was also observed [26, 63]. Theoretical models based
on the random-phase approximation (RPA) are able to
predict a fragmentation similar to the experimental one
only when extended with complex damping mechanisms
stemming from the nucleon-nucleon collisions and cou-
pling to low-lying states [9]. Even though the present
calculation does not capture fine details of this fragmen-
tation, it is interesting to note that the magnitude of4

FIG. 3. (a): The excitation spectrum of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance in40Ca. The TDDFT approach (red dashed
line) yields one frequency, in agreement with the classical oscillator picture. Note that the width of the peak is partially induced
by the value of Γ 0in Eq. (5). The MC-TDDFT spectrum (red solid line) is fragmented around the main GR peak, and new
high-energy components appear at twice and three times the energy of the main peak (see inset). Panels (b), (c), and (d) show
the same excitation spectrum for different combinations of basis states and initial conditions defined in the text: BS1-IC2,
BS2-IC1, and BS2-IC2, respectively. The appearance of multiphonon structures and their energies are robust with respect to
the change of basis states and initial conditions.
splitting is roughly reproduced based on an entirely dif-
ferent framework. Note that the present calculations con-
sider very few configurations compared with the extended
RPA framework. It would therefore be interesting to ex-
plore how this fragmentation evolves as more collective
degrees of freedom are taken into account.
Most interestingly, the new feature in Fig. 3(a) are the
structures in the 30 MeV ≤E≤60 MeV region: two
peaks at roughly twice and three times the energy of the
first fragmented peak. We verified the robustness of these
structures with respect to the change of initial conditions
and the choice of TDDFT trajectories. In particular, in
addition to the set of basis states (referred to as BS1) and
the set of initial conditions (referred to as IC1) discussed
above, we considered two more sets. For the second set of
basis states (BS2), we start by quadrupole-boosting the
NEDF ground state |Φ1(0)⟩by about 0 .5 MeV. The three
states of the BS2 set then correspond to (i) the boosted
state at t= 0, (ii) the boosted state at time τwhen
maximal deformation q20(τ) is reached for the first time,
(iii) and the boosted state at time τ/2. Furthermore, the
second set of initial conditions (IC2) is determined by
diagonalizing the collective Hamiltonian at t= 0, ren-dering the initial MC-TDDFT state equal to the actual
ground state. The excitation spectrum for BS1-IC2, BS2-
IC1, BS2-IC2 combinations is shown in panels 3(b)-3(d),
respectively. While relative height of peaks depends on
the way the initial state is prepared and the choice of
basis states, the appearance of peaks and their energies
are very robust. Additionally, we verified that the struc-
tures persist when another Skyrme effective interaction
is used.
The fact that these high-energy structures exhibit the
same splitting as the original GR represents a strong in-
dication that they correspond to the second and the third
quantum of the same excitation. Without making any a
priori assumptions on their existence, MC-TDDFT pre-
dicts the occurrence of multiphonon states on top of the
main GQR. Figure 4 summarizes the calculated energies
of multiphonon states, alongside the representative ex-
perimental data. The 1 σuncertainties were estimated
from the four different combinations of basis states and
initial conditions defined above. This estimate does not
include the uncertainty due to the nuclear interaction
and other possible sources. The main one-phonon peak is
found at Eph= (18 .1±0.2) MeV, in excellent agreement5

with the bulk of experimental data. In Refs. [26, 27], the
inelastic scattering of40Ca on40Ca at 50 MeV/nucleon
was measured in coincidence with protons and a two-
phonon state at (34 .8±0.5) MeV was established. This
is very close to our value of E2ph= (35 .7±0.4) MeV.
Finally, later inelastic-scattering experiments have found
a three-phonon structure built on the isoscalar GQR in
the energy range of 42 −55 MeV [28] but were not able
to precisely determine its energy. Another experiment
hinted at a possibility of a three-phonon giant dipole res-
onance in136Xe [21], but the corresponding cross section
was low and the authors were not able to exclude instru-
mental effects. To the best of our knowledge, these are
the only experimental observations of the kind in atomic
nuclei. The MC-TDDFT model confirms the existence of
a three-phonon isoscalar GQR state in40Ca with an en-ergyE3ph= (53 .6±0.7) MeV, within the relevant experi-
mental range. Besides this confirmation, our calculations
also demonstrate the survival of such excitation for a suf-
ficiently long time despite the high internal excitation of
the system.
We note that present calculations do not predict any
additional structures up to 100 MeV, including the re-
gion of a hypothetical fourth phonon at E≈72 MeV.
The obtained results support the quasibosonic picture of
multiphonon states as essentially harmonic excitations
[17]. The presence of anharmonicities is minor (see the
very slight departure from the dashed line in Fig. 4; based
on the reported excitation energies, we estimate it to be
of the order of 2%. This result is nontrivial because (i)
no harmonic approximation was explicitly made in our
calculations and (ii) it was argued that some mesoscopic
systems, such as metallic clusters, can exhibit extremely
strong anharmonicities [68].
IV. CONCLUSION
We showed that multiphonon collective states emerge
naturally within the new multiconfigurational TDDFT
model that includes quantum fluctuations in the collec-
tive space beyond the independent-particle approxima-
tion. The experimentally observed multiphonon states
in40Ca are obtained at nearly-harmonic excitation ener-
gies, in excellent agreement with experiments and with-
out an ad hoc introduction of phonon degrees of freedom.
Beyond its relevance for collective excitations, the MC-
TDDFT model and its extensions can be used to study
a variety of nuclear phenomena. For example, the inclu-
sion of pairing correlations would be crucial for TDDFT
studies of fission where the lack of quantum fluctuations
prevents the calculation of quantities such as mass yields
or angular momenta for the entire range of observed frag-
mentations [53]. Finally, while we focused on atomic
nuclei, this study may offer guidance for multiphonon
searches in other self-bound systems, such as quantum
droplets that were recently formed in laboratory [69–71].
