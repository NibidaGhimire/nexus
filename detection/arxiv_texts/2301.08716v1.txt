Abstract
This paper focuses on the development of minimum time control proﬁ les for point-to-point motion of a
gantry crane system in the presence of uncertainties in modal par ameters. Assuming that the velocity of
the trolley of the crane can be commanded and is subject to limits, an optimal control problem is posed to
determinethe bang-oﬀ-bangcontrolproﬁletotransitionthe sys temfromapoint ofresttothe terminalstates
with no residual vibrations. Both undamped and underdamped syst ems are considered and the variation
of the structure of the optimal control proﬁles as a function of t he ﬁnal displacement is studied. As the
magnitude of the rigid body displacement is increased, the collapse an d birthing of switches in the optimal
control proﬁle are observed and explained. Robustness to uncer tainties in modal parameters is accounted
for by forcing the state sensitivities at the terminal time to zero. T he observation that the time-optimal
control proﬁle merges with the robust time-optimal control is not ed for speciﬁc terminal displacements and
the migration of zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter parameterizing the op timal control proﬁle are used to explain
this counter intuitive result. A two degree of freedom gantry cran e system is used to experimentally validate
the observations of the numerical studies and the tradeoﬀ of incr ease in maneuver time to the reduction of
residual vibrations is experimentally illustrated.

1. Introduction
Control of cranes is a topic that has garnered increased interest over the past three decades coinciding
with the growthin the use ofpreﬁltering approachesto minimize resid ual vibrationsofsystems characterized
by underdamped motion. A vast majority of crane controllers can b e classiﬁed as open-loop or closed-loop,
with afewcombiningfeedforwardand feedbackcontrollersin atrac kingframework. Oneopen-loopapproach
is called input shaping [ 1] which consists of a time-delay ﬁlter which is designed to cancel the u nderdamped
poles of the system [ 2]. The domain of input shaping has matured and can account for unce rtainties
in model parameters. To account for uncertainties in the estimate d damping or natural frequencies of
the underdamped poles, multiple zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter are pla ced at the nominal locations of the
underdamped poles, resulting in robustness to uncertainties in the modal parameters. Controllers which are
robust around the nominal model [ 1] and those that account for interval domains of uncertainties [ 3] have
been developed. Constraints on jerk [ 4] and deﬂection [ 5] have also been taken into account in the design.
Recently distributed delay input shapers [ 6] have been studied which introduce a novel parameterization in
the design of input shapers. Including input shapers within a feedba ck loop has also been considered [ 7,8]
as researchers explore techniques to exploit the strengths of inp ut shapers.
Noakes, Petterson, and Werner [ 9] proposed a switching control proﬁle to generate oscillation-damp ed
transport and swing-free stop. Their technique consists of bang -oﬀ-bang acceleration proﬁles in which the
pulses are timed to minimize the cable sway during the maneuver and re sults in a swing-free stop. They

1experimentally demonstrated the results of the open-loop contro l design. Shah and Hong [ 10] applied input
shaping for the underwater transport of nuclear power plant’s fu el. There have been numerous publications
related to the use of input shapers [ 1,2,11] for sway control of cranes [ 12,5,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,
20,21,22]. Maghsoudi et al. [ 23] applied a distributed time-delay ﬁlter on a gantry crane. They used the
method proposed by Vyhlidal et al. [ 6] for uncertainty studies for gantry crane control and demonst rated
that applying a distributed time-delay ﬁlter lead to an asymmetric rob ustness behaviour of the residual
sway about the nominal stage. Ramli et al. [ 24] designed a neural network-based input shaper while Yavuz
and Beller [ 25] used neural networks for a closed-loop controller when it is combin ed with an input shaper.
Wahrburg et al. [ 26] and Ramli et al. [ 27] applied input shaping for maneuvers of an overhead crane with
non-zero initial conditions, with an objective of zero residual oscilla tions of the payload. Additionally, work
has been done in command shaping control for non-zero initial and ﬁ nal conditions [ 28]. Stein and Singh [ 29]
presented simulation results of velocity constrained design of input shaped control proﬁles for a gantry crane
system. Fliess et al. [ 30] used the concept of diﬀerential ﬂatness to control the traver sing and hoisting of an
overhead crane. This diﬀerential ﬂatness based design was exten ded to discrete time design by Diwold et
al. [31].
Alli and Singh [ 32] designed passive controllers for a distributed parameter repres entation of the crane
cable for point-to-point maneuvers where the integral of the time absolute error is minimized. O’Connor [ 33]
used a wave equation representation of the cable dynamics assumin g that the velocity of the trolley could be
commanded. The velocity of the trolley was assumed to be constrain ed and the damping was assumed to be
zero. Researchers included particle swarm optimization into contro ller design for overhead cranes [ 34,35].
Golovin et al. [ 36] developed a H∞robust controller for actively damping the structural vibrations o f the
gantrycrane system. Variouscontrolmethods havealsobeen pr oposedwhere the overheadcrane is modelled
as a double pendulum system [ 37,38,39,40]. A few papers proposed controllers which combine closed-loop
controller used in conjunction with open-loop shaped proﬁles to tra ck. Kolar et al. [ 41] proposed a hybrid
solution combining an open-loop generated crane trajectory as a r eference signal and closed-loop controller
for handling external disturbances. Li et al. [ 42] introduced an online planning method for minimum-time
control of overheadcranes. Furthermore, many papers consid ered the payload as a point mass whereas Stein
and Singh [ 43] proposed an input shaper used in conjunction with a proportional- derivative controller for a
crane with an inertial payload. Other work has considered sliding mod e [44,19,45], adaptive control [ 46],
discrepancy-basedcontrol [ 47] and compared diﬀerent control strategies [ 48] while including various external
disturbances on cranes. Apart from time-optimal control, Sun et al. [49] investigated an energy-optimal
controller for an underactuated double pendulum crane with state and control constraints. Compared to
active vibration suppression of a crane’s payload, Yurchenko et al. [50] used a passive method with an
absorber.
Thispaperconsidersatabletopgantrycranesystemdrivenbyste ppermotorswhichpermitscommanding
the position of the trolley. By imposing velocity limits on the trolley motio n, this paper considers the design
of velocity constrained time-optimal point-to-point control of a c rane moving in two dimensions. Since
the pendular motion is almost undamped, an undamped system model was ﬁrst considered. Subsequently,
the structure of switching function was used to parameterize the bang-oﬀ-bang proﬁle and the resulting
nonlinear programming problem was solved to determine the optimal s olution for any arbitrary maneuver.
The bang-oﬀ-bangcontrol structure was then generalized to ca ter to multi-mode systems with underdamped
modes.
The main contributions of this work include: (1) Development of a velo city constrained time-optimal
control proﬁle for a gantry crane which is robust to uncertainties in modal parameters, (2) Illustration of
the non-intuitive result that the robust and non-robust solutions are coincident for speciﬁc displacements,
(3) Illustration that a rectangular pulse input can attenuate the d ominant vibratory modes for speciﬁc
displacements, (4) Illustration of the change in structure of the o ptimal control proﬁle, and (5) Experimental
validation of all the aforementioned observations.
Section2presents the development of velocity constrained time-optimal co ntrol for an undamped gantry
crane system followed by the development of controllers which are r obust to uncertainties in the undamped
frequencies in Section 3. Section 4generalizes the optimal control formulation for a multi-mode syste m
with damped or undamped modes. Section 5presents a simple approach to determine the transition in the
2structure of the control proﬁle, followed by the validation of the d esign on a two degree of freedom gantry
crane system in Section 6. The paper concludes with a brief summary of the results of the pap er.

The gantry crane setup includes a trolley driven by a stepper motor which permits the command of
the trolley’s velocity by assuming that the acceleration is zero as the commanded velocity transitions. A
schematic of the crane and an equivalent spring-mass system are s hown in Fig. 1where a small angle
displacement is assumed [ 51] [52]. The spring-mass model can be written as:

wherevthe velocity of the trolley is considered as the input and is constraine d 0≤v≤Vm. The assumption
that velocity of the trolley can be used as a control input is based on papers which demonstrate velocity

whereHis the Heaviside step function. Eq. ( 8c) is derived using Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP)
which requires the optimal trolley velocity to be bang-oﬀ-bang. Eq. (8b) can be solved in closed form
resulting in the equation:
λ(t) =e−ATtλ(0) (9)
which can also be written as:
λ1(t) = cos(ωnt)λ1(0)+ωnsin(ωnt)λ2(0) (10)
λ2(t) =−sin(ωnt)
ωnλ1(0)+cos( ωnt)λ2(0) (11)
λ3(t) = (1−cos(ωnt))λ1(0)−ωnsin(ωnt)λ2(0)+λ3(0) (12)
for undamped systems. Since the switching function is BTλ, it reduces to the third costate which reveals
that the switching function is a non-zero mean harmonic. This struc ture will help comprehend the change in
structure of the optimal control proﬁle v(t) as a function of the ﬁnal displacement xf. Since the Hamiltonian
Hat all times, including the initial time, is zero, we have:
H(0) = 1+ λT(AX(0)+BVm) = 0 (13)
⇒λ3(0) =−1
Vm. (14)
Further, for a rest-to-rest maneuver, which is the focus of this paper, the Hamiltonian Hat the ﬁnal time
is:
H(tf) = 1+λT(AX(tf)+BVm) = 0 (15)
⇒λ3(tf) =−1
Vm. (16)
Substituting Eq. ( 16) into Eq. ( 12), we can show that:

Evaluating the slope of λ3(t) at the initial time and ﬁnal time, we can show that:
˙λ3(0) =−ω2
nλ2(0),and˙λ3(tf) =ω2
nλ2(0), (18)
which permits us to conclude that the switching function is anti-symm etric about the mid-maneuver time,
which implies there will always be an even number of switches and that p airs of switch times are equally
distant from the mid-maneuver time. Using Eq. ( 17), the time derivative of λ3(t) evaluated at the mid-
maneuver time is:

λ2(0) = 0 (19)
4which implies that the slope of the switching curve is always zero at the mid-maneuver time. This prompts
parameterising the optimal control proﬁle as:
v(t) =Vm(1−H(t−(T2−T1))+H(t−(T2+T1))−H(t−2T2)) (20)
as illustrated in Fig. 2, which in the frequency domain is:

Gc(s)(21)
whereGc(s) is the transfer function of the time-delay ﬁlter which generates t he bang-oﬀ-bang control proﬁle
when subjected to a step input. By requiring that a pair of zeros of Gc(s) cancel the undamped poles of
the system and the pole at the origin, one can derive the constraint to formulate a parameter optimization
problem. It can be seen that:
Gc(s= 0) = 1 −1+1−1 = 0 (22)
which implies that the transfer function has a zero at the origin. The rigid body boundary condition is
determined by integrating the bang-oﬀ-bang velocity proﬁle leading to the equation:
xi(t) =Vm(t−(t−T2+T1)H(t−T2+T1)+(t−T2−T1)H(t−T2−T1)−(t−2T2)H(t−2T2)) (23)
which at the ﬁnal time of t=tf= 2T2leads to the equation:
xi(2T2) =xf=Vm(2T2−(T2+T1)+(T2−T1)) (24)
↔xf=2Vm(T2−T1)⇒(T2−T1) =xf
2Vm. (25)
Furthermore, to cancel the undamped poles at s=±jωn, we have:
Gc(s=jωn) = 1−e−jωn(T2−T1)+e−jωn(T2+T1)−e−2jωnT2= 0 (26)
which reduces to:
1−cos(ωn(T2−T1))+cos(ωn(T2+T1))−cos(2ωnT2) = 0 (27)
sin(ωn(T2−T1))−sin(ωn(T2+T1))+sin(2 ωnT2) = 0 (28)
which simpliﬁes to:
2sin(ωnT2)(sin(ωnT2)−sin(ωnT1)) = 0 (29)
2cos(ωnT2)(sin(ωnT2)−sin(ωnT1)) = 0 (30)
5which leads to the solution:

ωn−T1 (31)
which results in the closed form solution:
2T2=π
ωn+xf
2VmandT1=π
2ωn−xf
4Vm(32)
where 2T2is the maneuver time tf. Since both T1andT2are functions of the maneuver xf, the scenario of
collapse of the switches requires T1= 0 which results in the constraint:
xf=2πVm
ωn(33)
which is a bang proﬁle or a constant velocity proﬁle. It should be note d that the collapse of the switches is
proportional to one period of the switching function2π
ωn. Any increase in time associated with a maneuver
greater than the bang proﬁle will introduce two additional switches . This results from the fact that there
will be two peaks or troughs of the switching proﬁle, which results in f our switches. An observation which
will be exploited later is the fact that since the switching function is a h armonic with a bias, the width of
all the oﬀ zones in the bang-oﬀ-bang proﬁles will be the same. Consid er a constant velocity proﬁle with no
zero zones which can be parameterized as:

Gc(s). (35)
The ﬁnal displacement is given by the equation:
xf= 2VmT2. (36)
The requirement that the transfer function Gc(s) places a zero at the location of the undamped poles of the
systems=±jωnrequires the constraints:
1−cos(2ωnT2) = 0 (37)
−sin(2ωnT2) = 0 (38)
which results in the solution:
T2=nπ
ωn,wheren= 1,2,3,.... (39)
Substituting the solution T2into Eq. ( 36), we have:
xf=2nπVm
ωn. (40)
The number of zero zones ndepends on the desired terminal displacement and is given by the con straint:
2(n−1)πVm
ωn≤xf≤2nπVm
ωn. (41)
For example, when 0 ≤xf≤2πVm
ωn, one zero velocity zone exists in the optimal velocity proﬁle. Since
all the oﬀ zones of the bang-oﬀ-bang proﬁles are the same, we par ameterize the width of each zero zone
as 2T1and only two parameters are needed to determine the velocity limited time-optimal control proﬁle.
Fig.3illustrates the variation of the switch time for each zone as the term inal displacement increases. The

Zones for (I) Zone 1, (II) Zone 2, (III) Zone 3.
7change in structure of the time-optimal control proﬁle with increa sing terminal displacements is illustrated
for three consecutive zones. Zone 1 is characterized by two switc hes which collapse for a speciﬁc terminal
displacement. Any increase in terminal displacement results in the int roduction of two additional switches
in the optimal control proﬁle. Fig. 3also plots the switching function which illustrates that as the optimal
control proﬁle transitions from one zone to the next. The switchin g function includes a phase shift of π
radians, which results in new switches being birthed at the initial and t erminal times of the maneuver. For
higher zones, switches can be introduced at the mid-maneuver time and 2π/ωndistance from each other.
To determine the values for T1, which is half the width of each zero velocity zone, and T2, which is
half of the maneuver time, a parameter optimization problem is solved which minimizes T2subject to the
constraints:
T2−nT1=xf
2Vm(42)
(−1)n+1nsin(ωnT1)−sin(ωnT2) = 0 (43)
where 2T1is the width of each of the zero pulse and 2 T2is the maneuver time. Eq. ( 42) is derived from
the ﬁnal displacement constraint and Eq.( 43) is derived from the constraint that the time-delay ﬁlter needs
to locate a pair of zeros at the location of the undamped poles of the system. Eqs. ( 42) and (43) can be
transformed into polynomial equations which can be solved eﬃciently to identify the optimal parameters
T1andT2. The Appendix provides the details of the transformation to gener ate polynomial equations for
zones 2 and 3 for illustrative purposes.
It is interesting to note that as xf→0, Eq. (42) requires T1→T2. Eq. (43) wheren= 1 requires
ωnT2=π−ωnT1 (44)
which results in the equation:
2T2=π
ωn(45)
which one can note is analogous to the two-impulse input shaper [ 1] which for an undamped system places
the two impulses of equal magnitude half a period of oscillation apart. Note that 2 T2corresponds to the
maneuver time.
The upper graph of Fig. 4illustrates the variation of the switch times and the maneuver time as a
function of the terminal displacement xf. The solid colored zone corresponds to the time intervals when the
input (velocity command) is at the maximum and the rest of the time int ervals are when the input is zero.
Whenxf= 240 mm, the two switches collapse resulting in a constant velocity pr oﬁle. This is followed by
the birth of four switches which collapse concurrently for a termina l displacement of xf= 480 mm following
which a six switch optimal control proﬁle is birthed. The lower half of F ig.4illustrates the optimal solution
for three unique displacements in zones 1, 2 and 3, labelled “a”, “b”, and “c” respectively.
3. Robust Control
The challenge of dealing with model parameteruncertainties is ubiquit ous and there have been numerous
approaches proposed for the design of robust open-loop contro llers including enforcing robustness around
the nominal model of the system or a minimax problem formulation whe re the maximum residual energy is
minimized over an interval of uncertainty. In this research we dete rmined the sensitivity of the states of the
system with respect to uncertainty in the spring stiﬀness which cor respond to uncertainties in the natural
frequency and force the state sensitivities with respect to the un certain frequency to zero at the terminal

The robust velocity constrained time-optimal control problem for the undamped system is solved for various
displacements. The variation in the optimal control proﬁle paramet erized by the switch times and maneuver
time are illustrated in Fig. 5as a function of the terminal displacement. Unlike the variation of th e switch
times as a function of terminal displacement and the concurrent co llapse of the switches, this phenomena
is not observed in the spectrum of switch times in Fig. 5. It nevertheless should be noted that the optimal
control proﬁle births and collapses switches as a function of termin al displacements, resulting in an optimal
control proﬁle where the number of switches is a function of the te rminal displacement. Fig. 6illustrates the
variation of the residual energy at the terminal time for the non-r obust and robust time-optimal controllers
over a range of uncertain natural frequencies for the undamped system. It is clear that the red line, which

by the blue line. These graphs are generated for a terminal displace ment of xf= 50 mm and a natural
frequency of ωn= 2π. The residual energy is given by:

of terminal displacement in comparison to that of the robust contr ol which is zero for all displacements. It

11is also intriguing that, for speciﬁc terminal displacements, the robu st and non-robust solutions are identical,
i.e., the maneuver times are the same and the curvatures are both z ero. To comprehend this unique result
the loci of the zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter which generates the ba ng-oﬀ-bang control proﬁles are generated
and are illustrated in Fig. 8.

All the graphs are generated for a nominal frequency of ωn= 2π. As illustrated by the upper graph of
Fig.8, the non-robust design requires that the time-delay ﬁlter place ze ros at the location of the nominal
undamped poles of the plant. Meanwhile, the lower graph of Fig. 8shows that the robust design mandates
that a pairs of zeros be located at the nominal poles of the plant. Th e horizontal loci of zeros for both the
robust and non-robust designs illustrates that the time-delay ﬁlte r places single and double sets of zeros at
the nominal location of the poles for the non-robust and robust de signs respectively. It can also be noted
that the zero loci for the non-robust design intersects the horiz ontal loci for a terminal displacement of
xf= 266.5 mm (shown by the red cross), resulting in a pair of coincident zeros which is what the robust-
controller is mandated to do. This is the reason why, for speciﬁc ter minal displacements, the robust and
non-robust designs results in identical solutions. It can also be see n that the same phenomena occurs for a
terminal displacement of xf= 513.3 mm.
Fig.9illustrates the location of the zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter for the n on-robust and robust designs
for the terminal displacement xf= 500 mm. The blue circles correspond to the non-robust design and the
red to the robust design. It should be noted that the robust desig n includes two pairs of zeros at ±2πjand
the non-robust design includes one pair of zeros. The arrows asso ciated with the blue and red circles are

the slopes of the loci of the zeros as a function of terminal displace mentxf. It is evident that a blue zero is
transitioning from above 2 πjwith a negative slope and is shown to coincide with the nominal poles of t he
system for xf= 513.3 mm, resulting in identical robust and non-robust designs.
The red and blue lines in Fig. 9illustrate the variation in residual energy as the location of the nomin al
poles of the system are varied. The non-robust design outperfor ms the robust design for perturbation of
the uncertain frequency above ωn= 2π, while the robust design outperforms the non-robust design for
perturbations below the nominal frequency. This asymmetry is due to the fact that the non-robust design
has a zero located immediately above the nominal frequency and end s up acting like the zero locations of a
minimax design [ 3]. It can also be seen that, for large perturbations of the uncerta in frequency, the residual
energy goes to zero at locations where the time-delay ﬁlter has a ze ro.
4. Generalization
Section2dealt with an undamped system with one mode which permitted a reduc ed order param-
eterization of the optimal control proﬁle by exploiting the symmetr ical nature of the control about the
mid-maneuver time. This symmetry is attributed to the fact that th e oscillatory motion excited by the
input does not damp out and the symmetric input can, by virtue of line arity of the system, generate an out
of phase motion of the undamped modes which cancels the existing os cillations. For a system with damping,
the symmetric nature of the control proﬁle is lost since the amplitud e of the oscillatory mode decays over
time. Consequently, the optimal control proﬁles need to explicitly p arameterize every switch in addition to
the maneuver time. Furthermore, there may be multiple modes which contribute to the output of interest
and those modes need to be quiescent at the end of the maneuver a s well. For a system with multiple modes,
characterized by damped or undamped modes, the bang-oﬀ-bang control proﬁle is parameterized as:

the optimal control proﬁle changes with the terminal displacement . Fig.10illustrates the variation of the
switch times as a function of the ﬁnal displacement and the control input overthe maneuver time for a single
mode system with an underdamped system model ( ζ= 0.01). For terminal displacements of 0 −700 mm,
three zones havebeen identiﬁed, separatedby the verticaldash ed lines. Three representativeoptimal control
proﬁles are presented corresponding to three displacements high lighted by the dotted lines and labelled a,
b, andc. It is interesting to note that in zone 3, which includes the dotted line c, the number of switches
required for the optimal control proﬁle starts with four switches , transitions to six switches, and returns to
a four switch optimal control proﬁle before ﬁnally transitioning to a two switch proﬁle.
14Figure 10: Switch and maneuver time variation of a non-robus t time-optimal controller for an underdamped 1 mode system.
5. Switching Proﬁle Transition
It is clear from Figs. 4and10that the structure of bang-oﬀ-bang control proﬁle changes as a function
of the terminal displacement. In Fig. 4, for small displacements ( xf≤240 mm), the optimal control proﬁle
is ﬁrst characterized by two switches and the switches, then, aft er collapsing, result in a pulse control
proﬁle which births a four switch control proﬁle which subsequently transitions to a six switch control
proﬁle. The change in structure of the optimal control proﬁle for underdamped systems is more involved
as all switches do not collapse for the same value of the terminal disp lacement. To exactly determine the
terminal displacement which corresponds to the birth or collapse of two or more switches, the constraint is
that the switching function and its time derivative are simultaneously zero at some time instant. For the
underdamped system the switching function λ3(t) can be represented as:
λ3(tcr,xf) =˙λ3(tcr,xf) = 0 (67)
wheretcris the switch time where two switches collapse. tcrandxfcan be determined by solving the
two nonlinear simultaneous equations in two unknowns while satisfying all the necessary conditions for
optimality.
6. Experimental Results
A scaled model of a gantry crane was fabricated to test and validat e the time-optimal control proﬁles
presented in this paper. The workspace of the gantry crane includ es a cuboid of dimensions 8’ ×4’×3’
as shown in Fig. 11. Its main element is a trolley which slides on a rail and is able to move a pay load over
a 2-dimensional space (the winch motion of the crane is not active). The crane is equipped with 3 stepper
motors of type NEMA 23 with a driver setting of 400 steps per revolu tion, where two of them are used for
the y-axis and one for the x-axis. For this experiment just the mot or of the x-axis is used. The drivers of the
stepper motors are connected to an Arduino MEGA 2560 which rece ives the switch times and the desired
position of the trolley as inputs. The maximum velocity of the trolley is s et to 240 mm/s. The inset of
Fig.11includes two images. The one on the left illustrates the 3D printed cha ssis which houses a cylindrical
steel mass of 500g. A rope and a hook enable a connection between the chassis and the trolley making it a
double pendulum system. The right panel illustrates the sensor inte grated into the payload which includes
two Arduino Nanos, a 3-axis gyroscope (MPU-6050), and two nRF2 4L01 single chip radio transceivers. One
Arduino Nano is housed within the chassis to process the data provid ed by the gyroscope and to transmit
the data to the other Arduino Nano, which is connected to a receive r. To permit a repeatable evaluation of
the robustness of the controller, a cable deployment setup was de signed which permits changing the length

16L1of the pendulum about a nominal length. The change in cable length ch anges the modal frequency of
the system and was used to test the robustness of the controller to uncertainties in modal parameters of the
gantry crane system.
A series of experiments were conducted to illustrate some of the no vel observations of the analytical
study. The ﬁrst of which included the collapse of the switches of the velocity constrained time-optimal
control proﬁle for a system with a single undamped mode. The simples t model of the gantry crane includes
representing the suspended mass as a single undamped pendulum an d a rectangular command, i.e., a bang
control proﬁle should cancel the undamped mode for a speciﬁc disp lacement. The natural frequency and
damping ratio of the ﬁrst mode of the pendulum with the nominal lengt h were experimentally determined
to beωn= 0.6832 Hz and ζ1= 0.001517 which was approximated to be zero in the development of the
controller.
Fig.12illustrates experimental results for terminal displacements reside nt in zone 1, which corresponds
to the optimal control proﬁle being characterized by a two switch b ang-oﬀ-bang proﬁle. A pulse with
increasing width is progressively applied to illustrate the fact that fo r speciﬁc terminal displacements, a
bang proﬁle (pulse) results in zero terminal vibration. Starting fro m a terminal displacement of xf= 200
mm and progressively increasing it until xf= 351.3 mm, the maneuver time increases, but at the same
time, the maximum angular displacement of the pendulum αis decreasing until it is not present at the end
of the maneuver for a displacement of 351 .3 mm. It can be noted that a small high frequency oscillation is
evident which corresponds to the second mode of the double pendu lum system which is not considered in
the controller design. For the next set of experiments, the double pendulum model of the crane is assumed

in the identiﬁcation of the parameters of the two modes of oscillation . The second mode’s parameters are
identiﬁed to be ωn,2= 6.159 Hz and ζ2= 0.026065 where the damping of the second mode is an order of
magnitude greater than that of the ﬁrst. For the two mode syste m, three controllers were tested. The ﬁrst
controller was designed to cancel the ﬁrst mode only. The second c ontroller was designed to cancel both of
the modes at the end of the maneuver and the third controller was d esigned to be robust to uncertainties
in both the modes’ natural frequencies. Fig. 13illustrates the time variation of the angular displacement
of the pendular payload where the green region corresponds to wh en the control input is active and the
yellow region is the post-actuation domain. The ﬁrst panel of Fig. 13illustrates the impact of cancelling
the ﬁrst mode, the second panel corresponds to the controller c ancelling both modes, and the third panels
display the elimination of residual vibration when the robust time-opt imal control proﬁle is used to drive
the system. These results were generated for a terminal displace ment of 100 mm and the pendulum length

whisker charts are used to illustrate uncertainties in the residual e nergy for each of the perturbed models.

vibration for the various pendulum lengths appear negligible compare d to the residual energy resulting from
the use of the non-robust control proﬁles. The ﬁnal set of expe riments illustrates a rather counter intuitive
result which claims that the non-robust design and robust designs a re coincident since the non-robust design
for speciﬁc terminal displacements of the single-mode model places multiple zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter at
the nominal location of the poles of the system. Fig. 15illustrates the residual vibration box and whisker
charts for a terminal displacement of xf= 390.1 mm, where it is evident that the residual energy curve is
relatively ﬂat. It should be pointed out that in this design, only the ﬁr st mode of vibration was considered
in the design, since observation of the coincidence of the robust an d non-robust design has been observed
for system with single undamped modes.
7. Conclusions
This paper presents an optimal control based development of a ve locity limited minimum time control
of a gantry crane system which is characterized by two modes of vib ratory motion. The variation in the
structure of the optimal control proﬁle is presented for a single m ode system where the vibratory modes
are undamped or underdamped. It is noted that, as the ﬁnal displa cement increases, there is an increase
in the number of switches in the optimal control proﬁle with periodic t erminal displacements requiring a
pulse control proﬁle with no switches. The optimal control framew ork is extended to account for multiple
vibratorymodes such as when the crane is modeled as a double pendu lum. The state sensitivities are used to
determine controllers which are robust to uncertainties in model pa rameters. Experimental results validate
the counter intuitive observation that for speciﬁc terminal displac ement the robust and non-robust optimal
control proﬁles are coincident. The experimental results also clea rly demonstrate the profound reduction in

22Appendix
The time-optimal control proﬁle for zone 1 illustrated in Fig. 4parameterized with two variables T1and
T2has a closed form solution. For higher order zones, the transcend ental constraint equations cannot be
solved in closed form, but can be converted to a polynomial equation as illustrated for zones 2 and 3.
Zone 2
The parameterization of the time-optimal control for Zone 2 leads to the constraints:
2sin(ωnT1)+sin(ωnT2) = 0 (A-1)
2T2−4T1=xf
Vm. (A-2)
Letxf/Vm= 2aωn, which gives 2 T2−4T1= 2aωnorT2= 2T1+aωn. Eq. (A-1) becomes 2sin( ωnT1) +
sin(2ωnT1+aω2
n) = 0. This can be further simpliﬁed to:
2sin(ωnT1)+sin(2 ωnT1)cos/parenleftbig
aω2
n/parenrightbig
+sin/parenleftbig
aω2
n/parenrightbig
cos(2ωnT1) = 0. (A-3)
Letα= sin/parenleftbig

aω2
n/parenrightbig
andt=ωnT1:
2sin(t)+βsin(2t)+αcos(2t) = 0. (A-4)
Lett= cos−1(z), resulting in the simpliﬁed equation:
2sin(cos−1(z))+βsin(2cos−1(z))+αcos(2cos−1(z)) = 0 (A-5)

/parenleftbig

z4+8βz3+/parenleftbig
−4α2−4β2+4/parenrightbig
z2−8βz+α2−4 = 0. (A-10)
Exploiting the knowledge that α2+β2= 1, we have:
4z4+8βz3−8βz+α−4 = 0. (A-11)
From Eq. ( A-11) the parameter T1can be calculated by using t=cos−1(z) andT1=t/ωn. Assuming
thatωnis given and the user can choose any xfwhich lies in the bounds of the zone, the quartic equation
provides a solution for the switch time T1. From there, the mid-maneuver time T2can easily be calculated
by Eq. (A-2). For illustrative purposes, assume ωn= 2π,xf= 400 mm and Vm= 240 mm/s. Since the
discriminant of the quartic equation is negative, we have two real an d two complex conjugate roots. We
disregard the complex roots, obtain T1,1= 0.0409 s and T1,2= 0.4247 s, and from there T2,1= 0.9151 s and
T2,2= 1.6827 s follows. The time-optimal problem requires the shorter time w hich is why T2,2is discarded.
Zone 3
The switch parameterization for Zone 3 can be written as:
3sin(ωnT1)−sin(ωnT2) = 0 (A-12)
2T2−6T1=xf
Vm. (A-13)
Letxf/Vm= 2aωn, which gives 2 T2−6T1= 2aωnorT2= 3T1+aωn. Eq. (A-13) becomes −3sin(ωnT1)+
sin/parenleftbig
2ωnT1+aω2
n+ωnT1/parenrightbig
= 0. This can be further simpliﬁed to:
−3sin(ωnT1)+sin(2 ωnT1)cos/parenleftbig
aω2
n+ωnT1/parenrightbig
+sin/parenleftbig
aω2
n+ωnT1/parenrightbig
cos(2ωnT1) = 0. (A-14)
23Letα= sin/parenleftbig
aω2

,β= cos/parenleftbig

andt=ωnT1, Eq. (A-14) can be rewritten as:
−3sin(t)+sin(2t)(βcos(t)−αsin(t))+cos(2 t)(αcos(t)+βsin(t)) = 0. (A-15)
Lett= cos−1(z):

(A-20)
With the knowledge that α2+β2= 1, we have:
−16z6+(24+24 β)z4+(−30β−18)z2+β2+6β+9 = 0 (A-21)
which can be reduced to a cubic equation by introducing z2=w, resulting in the equation:
−16w3+(24+24 β)w2+(−30β−18)w+β2+6β+9 = 0. (A-22)
If we pick ωn= 2π,xf= 600 mm and Vm= 240 mm/s, the only real solution which would satisfy Eq. ( A-12)
isT1= 0.0395 s and therefore T2= 1.3684 s. Note, t= cos−1(z) supports two real solutions and 4 complex
conjugate solutions. From there, T1can be calculated but in this case just one of the real solutions satis ﬁes
Eq. (A-12).
