We develop a theory of heat transfer induced by thermal charge fluctuations in two-dimensional
electron double layers. We consider pristine systems comprised of identical layers, and focus on
the regime of sufficiently high temperatures and interlayer distances d, where the relevant charge
fluctuations may be described using the hydrodynamic approach. In this limit heat transfer is
dominated by the plasmon resonances. For systems with Galilean-invariant electron dispersion
the interlayer thermal conductance κis proportional to the kinematic viscosity of the electron
liquid, and decreases as 1 /d4. In the absence of Galilean invariance κ∝σ/d3, where σis the
intrinsic conductivity of the liquid. This strong enhancement can be traced to a drastically different
broadening of plasmon resonances in systems with and without Galilean invariance.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stefan-Boltzmann law [1, 2] of radiative heat flux
emitted by a blackbody per unit area, W=σSBT4, was
explained by Planck in the first quantum theory [3] to
be determined only by its temperature Twith the uni-
versal constant σSB=π2/60c2, where cis the speed of
light [4]. This law holds asymptotically at large distances
from the body. In a geometry where two bodies are sep-
arated by a finite distance heat between them can also
be transferred by nonradiative evanescent modes of the
electromagnetic field [5–9]. At sufficiently small separa-
tions dthe contribution of this near-field energy transfer
(NFET) may greatly exceed that of blackbody. Phys-
ically, NFET arises because electromagnetic fields pro-
duced by fluctuating charges and currents in one system
induce currents in the other. In the presence of a tem-
perature difference the energy dissipated by these fluctu-
ating fields in the other part of the structure leads to a
net heat transfer.
In metallic systems charge fluctuations may propagate
in the form of collective plasmon excitations. Mahan
[10] pointed out that surface plasmons in metal bilayers
could lead to enhanced interlayer heat transfer. While
in bulk samples the plasmons are gapped, in systems
of reduced dimensionality they have a gapless spectrum,
leading to further enhancement of NFET. Stimulated by
the advances in the field of plasmonics [11] and advent
of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials [12],
plasmonic tuning of NFET attracted considerable atten-
tion recently [13–25]. There is a large number of recent
experiments [26–29] which report observations of excess
of heat flux in circuits between closely spaced electronic
nanostructures. For recent reviews, see Refs. [30–32] and
references therein.
The broadening of the plasmon pole plays a crucial
effect on the magnitude of plasmon enhancement of
NFET. The existing calculations focused on the colli-
sionless regime, where the plasmon attenuation arises
from Landau damping and may be evaluated using the
random-phase approximation (RPA). Here we focus onthe opposite, collision-dominated regime, in which the
rate of electron-electron collisions, γee, exceeds the plas-
mon damping rate. Furthermore, we specialize to the hy-
drodynamic regime [33, 34], in which γeeexceeds not only
the damping rate, but the frequencies of charge fluctua-
tions responsible for energy transfer. Since the character-
istic wave vectors of such fluctuations may be estimated
as 1/dthe conditions applicability of the hydrodynamic
description can be satisfied in modern high mobility de-
vices at intermediate temperatures.
Importantly, we find that the presence or absence of
Galilean invariance of the electron liquid drastically af-
fects the plasmon damping rate and consequently the
magnitude of NFET. Specifically, in Galilean invari-
ant systems the plasmon damping rate depends on the
wavevector qasνq2, where νis the kinematic viscosity.
In the absence of Galilean invariance the electron liquid
acquires a nonvanishing intrinsic conductivity σand the
plasmons decay with the Maxwell relaxation rate 2 πσq.
The different momentum dependence of the plasmon at-
tenuation rate produces a different dependence of the
NFET interlayer thermal conductance κond. In the
Galilean invariant case κ∝ν/d4, while in the absence of
Galilean invariance we get (modulo ln dterms)κ∝σ/d3.
It is interesting to note that in the absence of Galilean
invariance the 1 /d3dependence of κpersists not only
at a nonzero electron density, but also at double charge
neutrality, where the plasmon resonances do not exist.
The presentation is organized as follows. In Sec. II
we summarize the theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations
in electron liquids that form the basis of our analysis.
Conceptually it parallels with the methods of fluctua-
tion electrodynamics developed by Rytov [35] as we use
macroscopic equations of motion for electron fluid with
inclusion of random Langevin fluxes. The latter are sup-
plemented by the fluctuation-dissipation relation via ki-
netic dissipative coefficients of the pristine fluid such as
viscosity and thermoelectric matrix. In Sec. III we use
the Ehrenfest theorem to derive an expression for the
NFET flux. It provides an elegant methodological step
that enables us to make a connection to the commonly
used Caroli formula [17–23]. Next we analyze our generalarXiv:2305.10674v2  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  17 Aug 20232

expression in several cases of interest. This includes the
examples of Galilean invariant electron systems, such as
electrons in parabolic partially occupied quantum wells of
semiconductor heterostructures and generic liquids with-
out Galilean invariance, such as Dirac fluid in graphene.
Furthermore, the tunability of graphene-based systems
motivates exploration of the NFET in the crossover from
the high doping to the dual charge neutrality. We close
in Sec. IV with the summary of main results, comparison
to related works, and also provide relevant estimates.
II. HYDRODYNAMIC FLUCTUATIONS
We consider a planar geometry of two conducting
two-dimensional layers kept at different temperatures as
shown in Fig. 1. For simplicity we consider identical
layers. We assume that at the relevant frequencies and
wavevectors the electron liquids in each layer can be de-
scribed using the hydrodynamic approach. This requires
that intralayer mean free path due to electron-electron
collisions l(T) is shorter than the interlayer separation,
l≪d. The latter sets a typical momentum transfer
q∼1/dfrom one layer to the other thus leading to the
momentum relaxation. The electrons in the two layers
interact via the dynamically screened Coulomb poten-
tial. As a result, density fluctuations become strongly
coupled. This produces two branches of collective modes
in the bilayer, the optical and acoustic plasmons, corre-
sponding to the electron density oscillations, which are
symmetric and antisymmetric in the layer index. We
show below that thermal fluctuations of these plasmon
resonances enhance NFET. To capture this physics weuse the theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations formulated
by Landau and Lifshitz [36] with an extension to include
the Coulomb law in charged fluids.
Quite generally, the hydrodynamic equations have the
form of continuity equations, expressing conservation of
particle number (charge), energy, and momentum [37].
It further assumes local thermal equilibrium, so that the
state of the liquid is characterized by the local equi-
librium parameters, such as the hydrodynamic velocity
v, temperature T, chemical potential µ, and pressure
P(n, T) that defines an equation of state. Noting that the
entropy production is quadratic in deviations from equi-
librium, it may be neglected for the purpose of studying
linear transport. Therefore, in this approximation, en-
ergy conservation law can be replaced by the continuity
equation for the entropy current. It is convenient to com-
bine the continuity equations for the particle and entropy
currents into a single equation
∂t⃗ x=−∇·⃗J. (1)
Here, we introduced the column vector ⃗ x(r, t) that con-
sists of the number density nand the entropy density s.
Similarly, we introduced the corresponding column vector
⃗J(r, t) of the particle density current jnand the entropy
density current js, where the boldface letters denote the
usual spatial vectors as opposed to column vectors
⃗ x=
n
s
,⃗J=

,⃗X=
−eE

.(2)
For future use we also introduced a column vector of
thermodynamic forces ⃗X, which consists of the electro-
motive force (EMF) eEand the local temperature gradi-
ent, which are thermodynamically conjugate [38] to the
corresponding densities ⃗ x.
Writing the momentum density in the form p=ρv,
where ρis the mass density [39], we write the momentum
evolution equation in the form of Newton’s second law,
ρ∂tv=−∇·ˆΠ−en∇Φ. (3)
Here the electric potential Φ is related to the electron
density nby the Poisson equation. It defines the EMF
eE=−∇(µ+eΦ) in Eq. (2). The form of Eq. (3) reflects
the fact that the flow of momentum comprises both long-
range Coulomb interactions between electrons and also
local fluxes. The corresponding flux tensor ˆΠ≡Πijhas
the form [37]
Πij=Pδij−Σij. (4)
It includes local hydrodynamic pressure Pand viscous
stress tensor Σ ij. In the hydrodynamic approximation
the fluxes of conserved quantities are expanded to first
order in the gradients of equilibrium parameters. This
leads to the standard expression
Σij=η(∂ivj+∂jvi) + (ζ−η)δij∂kvk+ Ξij,(5)3
where ηandζare, respectively, the shear and bulk vis-
cosities. In this framework hydrodynamic fluctuations
rendered by random forces are described by including
Langevin sources Ξ ik(r, t), whose correlation function is
given by [36]
⟨Ξik(r, t)Ξlm(r′, t′)⟩=
2Tδ(r−r′)δ(t−t′)[η(δilδkm+δimδkl) + (ζ−η)δikδlm].
(6)
To close the system of hydrodynamic equations we also
need expressions for currents ⃗J. In Galilean-invariant liq-
uids, densities of both particle and entropy currents are
uniquely determined by the local hydrodynamic velocity
v(r, t). More generally, in the absence of Galilean in-
variance, additional dissipative contributions to currents
arise [40–42]. We thus have
⃗J=⃗ xv−ˆΥ⃗X+⃗I. (7)
The first term on the right-hand side of the above equa-
tion is the usual convective part of the current that de-
scribes transport of charge and entropy in the macro-
scopic flow of the fluid with the hydrodynamic velocity v.
The second term captures dissipative transport of charge
and heat relative to the fluid in response to driving forces
⃗X. The matrix of kinetic coefficients ˆΥ characterizes the
dissipative properties of the electron liquid. It is defined
by
ˆΥ =
σ/e2γ/T
γ/T κ/T
. (8)
The diagonal elements of this matrix are given by the
intrinsic conductivity σand the thermal conductivity κ.
The off-diagonal element is the thermoelectric coefficient
γ. The matrix form of ˆΥ respects the Onsager symmetry
condition. In the Galilean invariant system ( σ, γ)→0.
We should also note that in systems with parabolic and
linear spectra bulk viscosity is known to vanish, ζ→0
[43]. The fluctuation-dissipation relation dictates that
the current must contain fluctuating components in con-
junction with the corresponding dissipative transport co-
efficients. This is reflected by the third term on the right-
hand side of Eq. (7). It captures the thermally driven
spatial and temporal fluctuations of Langevin currents
⃗I(r, t). Their variances are defined by the dissipative
matrix ˆΥ in a usual way [44, 45],
D
⃗I(r, t)⊗⃗IT(r′, t′)E
= 2TˆΥδ(r−r′)δ(t−t′).(9)
The notation ⃗A⊗⃗BTis used to denote the direct product
of two vectors and symbol Tmeans vector transposition.
In the geometry of the bilayer this system of equations
needs to be replicated for each layer. In other words,
we have to assign fluctuating densities δn1,2and veloci-
tiesδv1,2for each layer that are coupled together in the
momentum balance equation through the Coulomb po-
tential. This hydrodynamic approach was recently usedto address the related problems of the Coulomb and ther-
mal drag [46–49] and can be readily applied to the NFET
effect as we show in the next section.
III. NEAR-FIELD ENERGY TRANSFER
The near-field thermal conductance can be straight-
forwardly evaluated with the help of the formalism pre-
sented above. For that purpose, we calculate the energy
flux from layer 1 to layer 2 by computing the work per
unit time done by the density fluctuations in layer 1 on
the electrons in layer 2. Using Ehrenfest’s theorem [38],
we can write the heat flux per unit area in the form [50]
W=e
2⟨δn2∂tδΦ2−δn1∂tδΦ1⟩, (10)
where ⟨. . .⟩denotes thermal average. To evaluate this av-
erage it is useful to pass to the Fourier space for all fluc-
tuating quantities, ( δn, δv, δΦ)∝exp(iqr−iωt). This
enables us to express the heat flux

in terms of the imaginary part of the dynamical structure

D(q, ω) =⟨δn+(−q,−ω)δn−(q, ω)⟩. (12)
To arrive at Eq. (11) we took the Coulomb potential in
the form
δΦ1(q, ω) =2πe
ϵq
δn1(q, ω) +δn2(q, ω)e−qd
,(13)
where ϵis the dielectric constant of the material sur-
rounding the electron layers, and made an additional lin-
ear transformation to the symmetrized basis of density
fluctuations δn±=δn1±δn2. The knowledge of Wnat-
urally leads to the NFET thermal conductance, which we
will determine to linear order in the temperature differ-
ence between the layers ∆ T=T1−T2. We thus introduce
κ(T) = lim
∆T→0W
∆T. (14)
The technical task now is to derive an analytical formula
for the density correlation function. This can be done by
solving linearized hydrodynamic equations and perform-
ing thermal averages over the Langevin sources.
A. Dynamical structure factor
It suffices to consider fluctuations in the stationary
fluidv= 0. Note, however, that locally density fluc-
tuations δntrigger fluctuations of the velocity δvas it4

F(x, y, β ) in the dimensionless units of momenta x=qdand

q= 1/d. The first plot is for the Galilean invariant system and
the second is for the generic case. The sharp ridges on the plot
correspond to dispersions of the symmetric and anisymmetric
plasmon modes ω±. In the long wave length limit x≪1 they
disperse as ∝√xand∝x, merge at x∼1, and gradually
disappear at x > 1. The spectral weight becomes small at
q→0 so resonances are not clearly visible. The dimensionless
parameter βcontrols the width of plasmon branches and is
defined by Eqs. (26) and (33) in each case respectively.
follows from the continuity. Thus we linearize the conti-
nuity equation (1) and find for the particle current fluc-
tuations
−iωδn +in(q·δv) +σ
e2(q2eδΦ) + i(q·In) = 0 .(15)
This equation applies to both layers. From the Navier-
Stokes equation (3) we find
−iρω(q·δv) =−ienq2δΦ +iq·(q·δΣ), (16)
where we additionally multiplied by momentum qto have
a scalar form of the equation. Here we neglected terms
due to pressure fluctuations
δP=∂P
∂n
Sδn+∂P

Vδs. (17)
Indeed, neglecting the first term is legitimate since den-
sity variations from the local compressibility are signifi-
cantly smaller than the contribution to density fluctua-
tions stemming from the long-range Coulomb potential,which is retained in Eq. (16). The second term in Eq.
(17) couples particle and entropy density fluctuations,
which physically come from the diffusive modes caused
by temperature fluctuations and thermal expansion of
the electron liquid. Our analysis shows that these con-
tributions are small as compared to plasmons driven by
fluctuating longitudinal stresses in the fluid. The lin-
earization of the stress tensor in Eq. (5) gives
q·(q·δΣ) = i(η+ζ)q2(q·δv) +q·(q·Ξ). (18)
Together with the form of the fluctuating potential in
Eq. (13) we can eliminate velocity fluctuations δvfrom
Eqs. (15) and (16) to arrive at two linear equations that
describe coupled density fluctuations in each layer. In
the symmetrized basis of normal modes these equations
decouple and we find as a result
δn±(q, ω) =δnσ
±(q, ω) +δnν
±(q, ω), (19a)

Γ±(q, ω), (19b)
δnν
±(q, ω) = (n/ρ)q·(q·Ξ±)
Γ±(q, ω). (19c)
The splitting of density fluctuations into two separate
contributions is natural since viscous stresses do not cor-
relate with the intrinsic fluctuations of currents. The
resonant denominator of the polarization function of elec-
tron fluid in a double layer is found in the form
Γ±(q, ω) =ω2−ω2

where

2π(ne)2q/ρϵ, and Maxwellian relaxation rate
χ= 2πσq/ϵ . Zeros of Γ ±define dispersion relations of
collective modes propagating in the system [51]. If we set
all dissipative kinetic coefficients to zero, then ω=ω±(q)
gives us two low-lying gapless collective excitations which
are plasmon poles as expected: ω+∝√qandω−∝qas
q→0. The imaginary part of the plasmon dispersion
defines attenuation of electron density oscillations. For
example, in the Galilean invariant case ℑω=ων∝q2;
therefore, fluctuations with sufficiently low qhave long
mean free path and as such plasmons remain well-defined
excitation in the hydrodynamic regime. In the generic
case of systems with broken Galilean invariance one finds
instead that attenuation of plasmons is dominated by the
Maxwell mechanism of charge relaxation, ℑω=χ±, due
to finite intrinsic conductivity in the systems. This be-
havior should also be contrasted to the high-frequency5

lines are superimposed on top of the color plot that defines
contours of the F(x, y, β ) function from Fig. 2. This plot is

(kinetic) regime, ω≫vFq, where plasmon attenuation
is dominated by the decay into two particle-hole pairs.
The corresponding rates for both Galilean invariant and
Dirac systems scale as ℑω∝q2[52, 53].
To complete the derivation of the dynamic structure
factor we need to perform thermal averages. This is easily
done with the help of correlation functions defined by
Eqs. (6) and (9). After a simple algebra we find:
⟨q·(q·Ξ±)q·(q·Ξ∓)⟩= 4q4(η+ζ)∆T, (22a)
⟨(q·In±)(q·In∓)⟩= 2q2σ
e2∆T. (22b)
Using these relations we can express the density structure
factor in Eq. (12) in the following form
D(q, ω) =Dν(q, ω) +Dσ(q, ω), (23a)
Dν(q, ω) = 4Γ+Γ∗

Dσ(q, ω) = 2Γ+Γ∗

e2∆T. (23c)
Here Dν(q, ω) denotes the contribution to the structure
factor that arises from random thermal stresses, and
Dσ(q, ω) denotes the contribution caused by random cur-
rents associated with the intrinsic conductivity. In the
above expressions we made use of the obvious symme-
try properties of Γ ±(q, ω), namely Γ ±(q, ω) = Γ±(−q, ω)
and Γ ±(q,−ω) = Γ∗
±(q, ω). We also observe that the
product Γ +Γ∗
−obeys the standard properties of response
functions; its imaginary part is odd in frequency and pos-
itive for positive frequencies. This makes the integrand
in Eq. (11) sign-definite, resulting in the thermal conduc-
tance that is manifestly positively definite.
In order to highlight the importance of the plasmon
resonance contribution to the heat flux we plotted the
integrand of Eq. (11) in the two-dimensional parame-
ter spaces of frequencies and momenta. As is clear from

the structure of Eq. (11) this integrand is the product
of the imaginary part of the dynamical structure factor,
phase space volume, and Coulomb potential. The upper
graph on Fig. 2 corresponds to the Galilean invariant
case, whereas the lower plot is for the generic case. To
generate these plots we normalized all momenta in units
of interlayer separation and all frequencies in units of
plasma frequency ωpatq= 1/d. In these dimensionless
variables the integrand in each case depends on a single
parameter (defined later in the text) that controls the
shape of the plot. In both cases plasmon branches are
clearly visible and sharpest at q∼1/d. It is apparent
from the plot that density fluctuations are strongly sup-
pressed everywhere away from the plasmon resonances.
This is further emphasized in the contrast plot of Fig. 3
that shows the same data as in Fig. (2) projected to the
ω−qplane.
B. Galilean invariant systems
We proceed to analyze the expression for the heat flux
Eq. (11) beginning with the case of Galilean invariant
electron systems. We thus set σ→0. Only the Dν
part of the structure factor from Eq. (23) contributes
in this case. From the definition of the NFET thermal

C. Systems with broken Galilean invariance
In generic systems, where both viscosity and intrinsic
conductivity of the electron liquid are nonzero, the den-
sity fluctuations responsible for NFET are generated not
only by random stresses but also by random intrinsic cur-
rents. We begin by examining the latter contribution, as
it is found to be dominant, and comment on the modifica-
tion to the viscous contribution later on. The discussion
presented in this section pertains to double-layer devices
consisting of, e.g., graphene monolayer or bilayer sheets.
Using Dσfrom Eq. (23) in the expression for the en-
ergy flux Eq. (11) we obtain the following expression for
the contribution of intrinsic conductivity to the thermalconductance:

Let us first focus on the limit of charge neutrality,
n→0. In this case the expressions simplify greatly;
Γ±≈ω(ω+iχ±) and ℑ(Γ+Γ∗
−)≈ω3(χ+−χ−). Notice
that the dynamics of charge fluctuations is overdamped
and corresponds to Maxwell charge relaxation with the
intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid. The impor-
tant point that there are no hydrodynamic plasmons in
undoped graphene was thoroughly discussed in the liter-
ature recently [54, 55]. Using an integral

we arrive at the following expression

Note that the ω2
νterm in the numerator of Eq. (29) can
be neglected as it contains four more powers of q, while
each power brings a factor of 1 /dafter the momentum
integration. Therefore, this piece will be subleading in
powers of 1 /das compared to the main contribution. As
the final step, using explicit forms of χ±from Eq. (21),
we find after the remaining momentum integration
κ=σ
8ϵd3. (32)
This is in agreement with the earlier analysis of NFET
at the dual neutrality point [49].
Given the degree of tunability of graphene devices
we investigate further how NFET depends on the car-
rier concentration. In order to analyze the high doping
regime we can approximate Γ ±≈ω2−ω2
±+iωχ±and
notice that ℑ(Γ+Γ∗
−)≈ω3(χ+−χ−) still holds since
χ−ω2
+−χ+ω2
−= 0. While the frequency integral in Eq.
(29) can be evaluated analytically the resulting expres-
sion is too cumbersome to present here. We establish the
final result in the form
κ=σ

where the dimensionless function g(β) can be efficiently
computed numerically; see Fig. 5. In the limit βσ≪1 a
rather accurate estimate can be found analytically:

(34)
We see that as compared to Eq. (32) the intrinsic con-
tribution has only a modest (logarithmic) density depen-
dence encoded by a parameter βσ.
The viscous contribution is also present in this case.
The analysis based on the form of Dνshows that κis7
given by the expression similar to Eq. (26) with the
difference, f(βν)→h(βσ), where h(β) is yet another
logarithmically slow dimensionless function. In view of
the fact that this viscous term scales ∝1/d4it remains
parametrically smaller than the contribution of intrinsic
conductivity given by Eq. (33).
D. Discussion
Let us now obtain estimates for NFET thermal con-
ductance κ(T) in the hydrodynamic regime and discuss
their implications for the general picture of temperature
dependence on NFET thermal conductance in high mo-
bility electron double layers.
1. Temperature regimes
As alluded above, the hydrodynamic description ap-
plies at intermediate-to-high temperatures where the in-
tralayer mean free path limited by electron-electron scat-
tering is short as compared to interlayer distance d. For
Fermi liquids with the typical rate of electron-electron
scattering given by γee∝T2/EF, where EFis the Fermi
energy, we have T > T c∼EF/√kFdwith kFbeing
Fermi momentum. The scale of Tcmarks the onset of the
collision-dominated regime for the relevant density fluc-
tuations in the particle-hole continuum. The crossover to
the collision-dominated regime for plasmons, γee> ω p,
occurs at a higher temperature scale, Th∼p
EFωp∼
EF/4√kFd. The consideration of the crossover regime,
Tc< T < T h, is beyond the scope of this work. It requires
a more detailed theory based on the kinetic equation, so-
called Boltzmann-Langevin approach [45]. The contribu-
tion of the particle-hole continuum to the NFET thermal
conductance at lower temperatures, T < T c, is compre-
hensively covered in the literature; see, for example, Ref.
[20]. Thus we focus on temperatures Th< T < E F.
2. Galilean invariant systems
Recall that shear viscosity of the Fermi liquid is η∼
n(EF/T)2[56], where logarithmic corrections specific to
the 2D case were disregarded for brevity. Therefore,
based on Eq. (26) we conclude that NFET thermal con-
ductance diminishes as ∝1/T2. In contrast, at the lowest
temperatures where the thermal charge fluctuations re-
sponsible for NFET correspond to electron-hole pairs in
the collisionless regime, the interlayer thermal conduc-
tance increases with temperature. Thus the overall tem-
perature dependence of κis nonmonotonic. We expect
κto have a peak at T∼Thas dominated by plasmons,
which can be easily estimated from Eq. (26)
κ(Th)∼EFk2
F(kFd)−7/2. (35)In the same range of parameters we also estimate that
parameter βνthat enters Eq. (26) is of the order
βν∼rϵvF
e21
kFd≪1. (36)
This estimate justifies approximations made in the
derivation of the asymptote of f(β) function in Eq. (28).
3. Graphene devices
In generic systems with broken Galilean invariance
temperature dependence of the NFET thermal conduc-
tance is primarily governed by the intrinsic conductivity
σ(T) at all densities. For instance, for graphene mono-
layers — Dirac fluid near charge neutrality — the known
results [57–59] of the perturbative renormalization group
give an estimate
σ(T)∼σQln2U
T, n→0, (37)
where σQis the conductance quantum and Uis a cut-
off energy scale of the order of the electronic bandwidth.
Somewhat surprisingly, the presence of the plasmon res-
onances at a nonzero density leads only to modest log-
arithmic modifications of the result as compared to an
undoped limit [per Eq. (33)]. The parameter βσin Eq.
(33) that determines the enhancement factor in Eq. (34)
can be estimated to be of the order of
βσ∼σ
e2s
e2
ϵvF1√kFd≪1. (38)
Consequently, for a double-layer system comprised of
graphene monolayers at nonzero density, the comparison
of the estimate of Eq. (33),
κ(Th)∼EFk2
F(σ/ϵv F)(kFd)−3, (39)
with Eq. (35), shows that the plasmon enhancement of
NFET is enhanced by the parameter√kFd≫1, as com-
pared to the Galilean invariant systems.
IV. SUMMARY
In this work we developed a theory of near-field en-
ergy transfer between two-dimensional electron systems
in the hydrodynamic regime. In this regime the inter-
layer thermal conductance is expressed in terms of the
dissipative coefficients of the electron liquid, namely it’s
viscosity and (in the absence of Galilean invariance) in-
trinsic conductivity. Applicability of the hydrodynamic
description requires that the range of temperatures, par-
ticle density, and carrier mobility are such that the elec-
tron mean free path is the shortest length scale in the
problem. These conditions can be realized in modern8
semiconductor quantum-well heterostructures and van
der Waals materials. We considered both Galilean invari-
ant liquids and electron systems where this invariance is
broken, such as in graphene devices.
Using Ehrenfest’s theorem, we obtained a general for-
mula for the NFET conductance in terms of the dynam-
ical structure factor of the fluid, Eq. (11). We then
obtained the hydrodynamic expression for NFET ther-
mal conductance by evaluating the contribution of hy-
drodynamic thermal fluctuations to the structure factor.
We found that plasmon resonances produce a strong en-
hancement of NFET. We note that temperature fluctu-
ations can also be described in this framework, but pro-
duce a subleading effect because they correspond to dif-
fusive spreading at quasineutrality. In Galilean-invariant
systems NFET conductance κ, as well as the plasmon
lifetime, is determined by the kinematic viscosity νof
the electron fluid. Modulo logarithmic corrections [see
Eq. (26)] κfalls off with interlayed distance as 1 /d4
and follows the same temperature dependence as ν. In
systems without Galilean invariance charge fluctuations
relax exponentially with the Maxwell rate [see Eq. (29)].
As a result, κis governed by the intrinsic conductivity
of the electron liquid and falls off as 1 /d3with inter-
layer distance. The strong NFET effect survives even atcharge neutrality where plasmons are absent. At finite
density this effect persists with further enhancement by
plasmons [Eq. (33)].
The nonperturbative character of our results makes
them applicable to strongly correlated systems. We be-
lieve that NFET effect could prove fruitful in further
exploration of strongly interacting electron systems, in-
cluding anomalous metals [60], strongly correlated 2D
systems [61], and strange metals [62].
