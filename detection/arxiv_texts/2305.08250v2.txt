Abstract
Recent experimental studies have demonstrated the possibility of uti-
lizing strong terahertz pulses to manipulate individual ferroic orders on
pico- and femtosecond timescales. Here, we extend these findings and
showcase the simultaneous manipulation of multiple ferroic orders in
BiFeO 3, a material that is both ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic at
room temperature. We find a concurrent enhancement of ferroelectric
and antiferromagnetic second-harmonic generation (SHG) following the
1arXiv:2305.08250v2  [cond-mat.str-el]  23 Jan 20242
resonant excitation of a high-frequency fully-symmetric phonon mode.
Based on first-principles calculations and phenomenological modeling,
we ascribe this observation to the inherent coupling of the two ferroic
orders to the nonequilibrium distortions induced in the crystal lattice
by nonlinearly driven phonons. Our finding highlights the potential of
nonlinear phononics as a technique for manipulating multiple ferroic
order parameters at once. In addition, this approach provides a promis-
ing avenue to studying the dynamical magnetization and polarization
behavior, as well as their intrinsic coupling, on ultrashort timescales.

1 Introduction
Identifying efficient pathways to control the quantum phases of matter is a
key challenge for the development of new materials with functional proper-
ties. In magnetoelectric multiferroics, the coupled magnetic and ferroelectric
orders enable the control of magnetization using electric fields and vice versa,
promising energy-efficient switching operations for data processing, and signif-
icant research efforts have been made to develop this concept within the last
decade [1, 2]. BiFeO 3, shown in Fig. 1a, is a well-known multiferroic mate-
rial at room temperature, whose ferroelectric polarization can be switched by
an applied electric field, which is accompanied by a reorientation of its anti-
ferromagnetic domain [3, 4]. While this magnetoelectric coupling is appealing
for low-energy consumption spintronics [5, 6], the timescale of the switching
process is limited by the ramp-up time of the applied electromagnetic fields,
generally to nanosecond timescales.
In contrast, ultrashort laser pulses provide the possibility to generate large
electric field strengths on sub-picosecond timescales, and recent experimental
realizations of intense terahertz (THz) and mid-infrared (MIR) pulses with
peak electric fields exceeding several megavolts per centimeter (MV cm‚àí1)
have opened up new pathways for dynamical materials engineering [7, 8].
When the electric field component of a laser pulse is coupled resonantly to
the dipole moment of an optical phonon mode, coherent lattice vibrations
can be driven with amplitudes exceeding the harmonic regime, making anhar-
monic contributions of the interatomic potential-energy surface integral parts
of the dynamics. A particular manifestation of this anharmonicitiy is nonlin-
ear phononic rectification, a lattice analog to optical rectification, in which
nonlinear coupling between phonon modes leads to a quasistatic distortion of
the crystal structure [9‚Äì12], creating transient crystal geometries that are not
accessible in equilibrium. Examples of nonlinear phononic rectification have
achieved to manipulate and induce ferroelectric [13‚Äì17] and magnetic order
[18‚Äì24] individually. It has so far remained unexplored however, whether light
can manipulate multiple ferroic order parameters simultaneously in a single
domain.3

polarization ( PFE) is along the stretched body-diagonal of the pseudocubic unit cell, iden-
tified as [1 ¬Ø11] here. The spins between nearest-neighbor iron ions are antiferromagnetically
aligned (red arrows) and form a spin cycloid with a wavelength of 62 nm along the normal
vector œÑof the mirror plane (yellow) [25, 26]. In a single-magnetic domain crystal, the spin
cycloid breaks the three-fold rotation symmetry around PFE.b,(Left) Initial state with the
equilibrium ferroelectric polarization and a thermal broadening of the iron-spin alignment.
(Right) The lattice distortion following the resonant excitation of a A1phonon leads to a
change in polarization and to an improved alignment of the iron spins.
Here, we coherently excite a high-frequency fully-symmetric ( A1) phonon
mode in BiFeO 3with intense MIR pulses and we probe the evolution of
ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetism using time-resolved second-harmonic
generation (SHG) at room temperature. We find that both the ferroelec-
tric and antiferromagnetic contributions to the SHG signal are enhanced on
a sub-picosecond timescale. We perform phonon dynamics simulations sup-
ported by density functional theory calculations that predict a rectification
of the A1modes arising from both three-phonon coupling and cubic anhar-
monicities, whose polar atomic displacements increase the magnitude of the
ferroelectric contribution to the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor.
Comparison with experimental data confirms that the total change in SHG
signal contains a significant proportion of antiferromagnetic contribution. Our
calculations indicate that the rectified displacements along the A1modes lead
to an enhancement of the magnetic interactions between the iron spins, which
we interpret as a stabilization of the antiferromagnetic state (Fig. 1b).4
2 Results
2.1 Phonon-driven enhancement of second-harmonic
generation
We study a single-crystal sample of BiFeO 3, cut and polished along the pseu-
docubic (110) plane. The ferroelectric polarization PFEis oriented along the
body diagonal, [1 ¬Ø11], which is parallel to the polished surface, as illustrated in
Fig. 1a. Previous works show that the lattice, electronic, and magnetic degrees
of freedom in BiFeO 3are highly sensitive to external fields [25, 27‚Äì31]. The
large optical nonlinearities in BiFeO 3[32] enables optical rectification that
leads to coherent THz emission, which is a sensitive probe of the ferroelectric
polarization [33]. We observed a pronounced angular dependence of the emit-
ted THz field amplitude that verifies that our sample is predominantly in a
single domain (Supplementary Information Section S1).
To control structural parameters critical to the ferroic properties, we
used intense MIR pulses to excite the high-frequency A1mode in BiFeO 3at
15.7 THz [34]. We used frequency-tunable MIR pulses with an excitation flu-
ence of 12 mJ cm‚àí2to couple to the electric dipole moment of the A1mode
that is oriented along the ferroelectric polarization direction. Time-resolved
SHG was used to probe the MIR-induced changes in the ferroic order param-
eters. The SHG intensity is proportional to the square of the light-induced
nonlinear polarization, I(2œâ)‚àù |P(2œâ)|2. The transient state is characterized
by the light-induced change in SHG intensity, ‚àÜ I(2œâ), with the probe polar-
ization oriented parallel to the light scattering plane (angle œï= 0‚ó¶) and the
p-polarization detection configuration. A schematic of the pump-probe geom-
etry is shown in Fig. 2a, indicating the atomic displacements induced by the
high-frequency A1mode that are primarily composed of oxygen-ion motion. In
Fig. 2b, we show the characterization of the MIR pump pulse and the polariza-
tion dependence of ‚àÜ I(2œâ). When the polarization of the MIR pulse is oriented
along PFE, the SHG intensity is enhanced by 1.5%, whereas a polarization of
the MIR pulse perpendicular to PFEyields no pump-induced change. When
tuning the center frequency of the MIR pump pulse away from the A1phonon
frequency, the pump-induced ‚àÜ I(2œâ) decays rapidly, as shown in Fig. 2c, indi-
cating a resonant phonon-driven effect. Furthermore, the maximum transient
change in polarization scales linearly with the pump fluence, shown in Fig. 2d,
indicating a mechanism based on nonlinear phononic rectification and ionic
Raman scattering [35].

susceptibility tensor [36, 37]. The nonzero elements of the SHG tensors are
determined by the point-group symmetry of the crystal. At room temperature,
the crystal lattice of BiFeO 3is rhombohedral with a 3 mpoint-group symmetry
(space group R3c). In the bulk, the antiferromagnetically aligned spins exhibit
an additional long-range cycloidal modulation (Fig. 1a) that can be oriented
along three equivalent wave vectors, commonly denoted by ( œÑ1,œÑ2,œÑ3). The
wave vectors œÑiare perpendicular to PFE[25, 26].Our sample is predominantly
in a single ferroelectric domain, as well as a single spin-cycloid domain, as
discussed in Supplementary Information S1 and S3. The uniqueness of the
spin-cycloid wave vector lifts the three-fold rotation symmetry around PFE,
and effectively lowers the symmetry of the system to monoclinic, described by
point group m. Because the ferroelectric and magnetic properties determine
the point-group symmetry, information about them is intrinsically encoded
in the symmetry and magnitude of the SHG tensor components that can be
probed by varying the polarization of the probe beam.6

intensity, I, are shown for a,p-polarization detection and b,s-polarization detection (open
circles). Polar plots of the pump-induced change of the SHG intensity, ‚àÜ I, are shown for c,
p-polarization detection and d,s-polarization detection at the maximum of the pump-probe
response (open squares). In all plots, solid lines are fits of the SHG intensities, composed of
the ferroelectric contribution (grey areas) and the antiferromagnetic contribution (red areas).
Both the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic contributions show an enhancement following
the resonant phonon excitation.
In Figs. 3a and b, we show the probe-polarization dependence of the SHG
signal in equilibrium. For the p-polarization detection, the SHG polar plot has
two lobes at 0‚ó¶and 180‚ó¶, respectively. This can be fitted using nearly exclu-
sively the œá(i)tensor components (ferroelectric contribution, grey area). For
thes-polarization detection, the SHG signal has four lobes, with a clear asym-
metry along the 60‚ó¶and 240‚ó¶directions. This asymmetry is due to the nonzero
œá(c)tensor components (antiferromagnetic contribution, red area) arising from
the symmetry lowering in the single spin-cycloid domain. Similar features were
observed in BiFeO 3thin films, in which the orientation of the asymmetric SHG
component was used to identify different antiferromagnetic domains [38]. In
Figs. 3c and d, we show the SHG polar plots in the phonon-driven state at
the maximum of the pump-probe response. For both the p- and s-polarization
detections, ‚àÜ Imaxis anisotropic and primarily positive with varying probe
polarization. The maximum enhancement for both ‚àÜ Imax
p/Ipand ‚àÜ Imax
s/Is
is approximately (1.5 ¬±0.4)%. Intriguingly, the dominant contributions to the7
pump-induced p- and s-signal changes are from different œátensors. In the p-
detection channel, the maximum enhancement in SHG intensity is along 0‚ó¶
and 180‚ó¶, given by the ferroelectric SHG tensor (grey area in Fig. 3c). In con-
trast, in the s-detection channel, the maximum enhancement in SHG intensity
is along 60‚ó¶and 240‚ó¶, dominated by the antiferromagnetic SHG tensor (red
area in Fig. 3d). In order to shed light on the physical mechanisms that lead
to this simultaneous enhancement of ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic SHG
enhancement, we perform simulations of the nonlinear phonon dynamics that
follow the coherent excitation of the high-frequency A1mode by the MIR pulse.
2.2 Simulations of nonlinear phonon dynamics
We evaluate the nonlinear vibrational response and the corresponding dynam-
ics of the lattice polarization and the magnetic interactions in a semi-classical
oscillator model, for which we compute the input parameters from first prin-
ciples using density functional theory. The point-group symmetry of BiFeO 3
allows for quadratic-linear three-phonon couplings of the resonantly driven
high-frequency A1mode (calculated eigenfrequency 15.3 THz) to the three
low-frequency A1modes (calculated eigenfrequencies 8.8, 7.4, and 4.8 THz)
present in the system, which we denote as Ah

coupling is described by an interaction potential of V=cQ2

1modes that is pro-
portional to the mean-squared amplitude of the Ah

Furthermore, as the high-frequeny A1mode is driven with a large amplitude, it
can experience self-rectification through cubic-order anharmonicity, described
by the potential term V= ÀúcQ3
Ah
1. Because all A1modes are infrared active,
the rectification induces a quasistatic electric dipole moment and therefore an
electric polarization in addition to the ferroelectric polarization. Details of the
evolution of the phonon amplitudes according to the oscillator model and the
density functional theory calculations of the coupling coefficients are provided
in the Methods section and in the Supplementary Information Section S4.
In Fig. 4a, we show the displacements of the ions for the sum of the rectified
components of all four A1modes. The cations, bismuth and iron, move in
opposite directions along the [1 ¬Ø11] direction. In Fig. 4b, we show the transient
polarization induced by the rectified components of all four A1modes, as
well as the relative change of lattice polarization compared to the equilibrium
ferroelectric polarization of 90 ¬µC cm‚àí2. The rectifications of the individual A1
modes induce opposing polarizations due to the opposite signs of their mode
effective charges that lead to only a small net change in polarization, which
can be explained by the opposite net motion of cations shown in Fig. 4a.
In order to predict the pump-induced change in SHG intensity, we calculate
and compare the ferroelectric contribution to the SHG tensor components of8

both the equilibrium and transiently distorted lattice structures at the max-
imum of the vibrational response (see Supplementary Information Section S4
for computational details). In Figure 4c and d, we show the polar plots of
the change in SHG intensity, ‚àÜ I, for the p- and s-detection channels that we
obtain from the modified SHG tensor components due to nonlinear phononic
rectification. The calculations well reproduce the experimental features (grey
areas in Fig. 3c and d), which confirms the ferroelectric contribution to the
SHG enhancement of ‚àÜ Ip, and supports the experimental finding that the
enhancement of ‚àÜ Isalong 60‚ó¶and 240‚ó¶must stem from the antiferromagnetic
œá(c)tensor (red area in Fig. 3d).9
Finally, we investigate the impact of the driven structural state on the
magnetic order by computing the changes in the exchange interactions and
magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the iron spins that arise from the quasistatic
displacements of the A1modes. (For details of the calculations, see Methods
and Supplementary Information S4.4.) We show the changes of the mag-
netic interactions upon phonon displacement in Fig. 5. Intriguingly, we obtain
enhancements of all magnetic interactions in the driven state, comparable in
magnitude to the changes in electric polarization. Using the maximum recti-
fied amplitudes for each of the A1modes (Supplementary Fig. S4), we find
that the nearest neighbor exchange J1(Fig. 5a) overall increases in magni-
tude by 0.03%, the next nearest neighbor exchange J2(Fig. 5b) increases
by 0.5%, and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (Fig. 5c) increases by 0.6%.
This increase in both antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and the mag-
netocrystalline anisotropy indicates a more robust magnetic ordering in the
driven state than in the ground state, which we suggest is at the heart of
the enhancement of the antiferromagnetic SHG signal. Note however that we
employed a simplified model, neglecting the spin spiral in the magnetic order
of BiFeO 3. Consequently, these numbers should be used with caution and a
more refined model would be necessary for a comprehensive quantitative dis-
cussion, as well as explicit calculations of the antiferromagnetic SHG tensors,
which are beyond our current methodology.
3 Discussion
We have demonstrated a simultaneous enhancement of ferroelectric and
antiferromagnetic second-harmonic generation in BiFeO 3by resonant excita-
tion of a high-frequency fully-symmetric phonon mode. We stress that the
pump-induced SHG intensity changes are not a multi-domain effect, as the
single-crystal sample studied here is predominantly in a single ferroelectric and
spin-cycloid domain. The SHG signals from minor domains are negligible and
do not match the experimental data, see Supplementary Information Section
S3. We can further exclude the contribution from MIR-induced SHG, which
involves the third-order susceptibility tensor, œá(3).The œá(3)signal is spectrally
filtered (see Methods) and the œá(3)process is spatially separated from the
œá(2)process due to the 45‚ó¶angle between the SHG probe and the MIR pump
beams. In addition, the œá(3)process would result in a quadratic pump fluence
dependence for ‚àÜ P(2œâ), not the linear relation observed here (Fig. 2d).
The enhancement of the ferroelectric contribution can be well reproduced
by our calculations of the œá(i)tensor-component modulations due to the
transient lattice distortion induced by nonlinear phononic rectification. Intrigu-
ingly, the lattice polarizations of the A1phonon have opposite signs due to
the counter-phase motion of the cations along the direction of ferroelectric
polarization, PFE, and nearly cancel each other out. In turn, they enhance
the SHG tensor components directly, therefore leading to a larger P(2œâ) in
comparison to the equilibrium state that our measurements pick up. While10

our theory captures the ferroelectric SHG features well, a direct calculation
of the antiferromagnetic SHG tensor is beyond the scope of this work. Our
calculations indicate however that both the exchange interaction and magne-
tocrystalline anisotropy, which are responsible for the magnetic ordering, are
enhanced by the rectified displacements of the A1modes. This mechanism
of magnetic-interaction control through phonons has been shown for nonpo-
lar magnets before [18‚Äì20, 39]. As a result, this modification leads to a more
robust magnetic ordering and likely to changes of the antiferromagnetic œá(c)
tensor components, similar to the ferroelectric case. The fully-symmetric A1
modes by definition preserve the symmetry of the system and while they leave
the relative distances between the iron ions mostly unchanged, they modify the
relative distances between the iron and oxygen ions. This could further affect
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that is responsible for the noncollinear
arrangement of spins in BiFeO 3.
Finally, we briefly touch on other possible mechanisms of phonon-induced
magnetization control, which could be at play in addition to the enhancement
of magnetic interactions. One possibility concerns phonon-induced symme-
try breaking of the orbital configuration, which has recently been shown to
stabilize magnetization above the ordering temperature in a transition-metal11
ferromagnet [40]. Due to the fully-symmetric nature of the A1modes, we can
likely rule out this mechanism in our case. Another possibility concerns coher-
ent magnon excitation through coupling to the phonons, which has in the
past been described as ionic Raman scattering by magnons [41‚Äì43]. While
ionic Raman scattering of the A1modes by the magnons might be possible in
BiFeO 3, only circularly polarized phonons would lead to a unidirectional force
on the spins [44]. All A1modes involved in the dynamics are linearly polar-
ized, and we therefore also rule out this mechanism for our case. Furthermore,
the spectrum of our MIR pulse is far away from the electromagnon resonances
in BiFeO 3[45, 46], which allows us to exclude a coupling to the spins through
the dipole moment of the spin cycloid. With the data and calculations given
thus far, we therefore find it most likely that the modifications of the exchange
interactions and magnetocrystalline anisotropy lead to a stabilization of the
antiferromagnetic order and to a change of the œá(c)components.
4 Conclusion
To conclude, our results show that ultrashort pulses in the THz and MIR spec-
tral range can be used to address multiple ferroic order parameters at once,
utilizing the coupling to nonlinearly driven phonon modes. We have demon-
strated simultaneous ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic SHG enhancement for
the case of the prototypical multiferroic material BiFeO 3, but we expect that
this approach will be applicable generically to materials exhibiting magneto-
electric coupling. The ferroic orders in BiFeO 3form independently below the
respective Curie and N¬¥ eel temperatures at 1100 and 640 K. In so-called type-
II multiferroics, in contrast, the ferroic orders are interdependent and emerge
together, but these materials often suffer from very low multiferroic ordering
temperatures [47]. An intriguing question therefore arises, whether both ferroic
orders can be stabilized simultaneously above the multiferroic ordering tem-
perature through coherent phonon excitation. This problem can be regarded

5 Methods
5.1 Crystal growth
The BiFeO 3single crystal was grown using a traveling solvent technique in
a Laser Floating Zone (LFZ) furnace [50]. Bi 2O3(99.975%, Alfa Aesar) and
Fe2O3(99.995%, Alfa Aesar) powder are mixed in molar ratio 1 : 1 and 4 : 1
for the feed rod and the traveling solvent, respectively. The feed rod material
was sintered at 800‚ó¶C for 20 hours with one intermediated grinding, and the
solvent was sintered at 700‚ó¶C for 5 hours. A 0.15 g solvent pellet was placed on
top of the seed rod before starting the floating zone growth. The growth was
performed in air, and the growth rate was 1 mm h‚àí1. The as-grown crystal is12

(x, y, z ) laboratory frame and the ( X1, X2, X3) crystal frame indicated. A half-wave plate
(HWP) rotates the polarization of the 800 nm pulses. A dichroic mirror (not shown) reflects
the second-harmonic generation signal and removes the residual 800 nm signal. A band-pass
filter (10 nm bandwidth) removes signals from higher-order optical processes. An analyzer
selects either the vertically polarized ( s) or horizontally polarized ( p) SHG signal.
oriented by a Laue x-ray camera. The ferroelectric domain structure has been
characterized by optical microscope, circular interference differential contrast
and piezoresponse force microscopy imaging (Supplementary Information S3).
5.2 MIR pump-SHG probe setup
The fundamental beam for SHG is from a Ti:sapphire laser with a repetition
rate of 1 kHz, energy of 30 nJ, and a duration of 40 fs. A schematic represen-
tation of the setup is shown in Fig. M1. A half-wave plate (HWP) was used to
rotate the polarization of the fundamental beam. The beam was focused SHG
signal was spectrally filtered by a band-pass filter, spatially filtered by an iris,
and then detected by a photo-multiplier tube. A Glan-Taylor prism was used
to select the desired polarization of the second-harmonic signal. All optical
measurements were performed at room temperature, with a 45‚ó¶incidence in
reflection geometry.
MIR pump pulses with tunable wavelengths between 13 and 18.5 micron,
and a duration of 250 fs were generated by optical parametric amplification
and subsequent difference frequency generation in a GaSe crystal. The MIR
pulses were focused on to the sample at normal incidence, with a diameter of
220 micron and a maximum excitation fluence of 12 mJ cm‚àí2.
5.3 Fits of the SHG signal
At room temperature, BiFeO 3crystallizes in rhombohedral symmetry with
point group 3 mand space group R3c. We set X3as the ferroelectric axis and
X2as the normal to the mirror plane of the trigonal structure (Fig. M1).
In a single antiferromagnetic domain, the long-range cycloidal modulation of
the spin breaks the three-fold rotation symmetry around PFE, reducing the
symmetry of the material to monoclinic with point group m. Details of the13
SHG tensors can be found in Supplementary Information Section S2. The fit
reveals that the cycloidal spin modulation direction is along X2.
5.4 Theory of nonlinear phonon dynamics
We use a phenomenological oscillator model to evaluate the nonlinear vibra-
tional response of the A1modes and the corresponding lattice-polarization
dynamics following the excitation by an ultrashort MIR pulse, for which we
compute all parameters from first principles using density functional theory.
Specifically, we solve the equations of motion
¬®Qi+Œ∫iÀôQi+‚àÇQiV= 0, (2)
where Qiare the normal mode coordinates (amplitudes) and Œ∫ithe phe-
nomenological linewidths of the A1modes in BiFeO 3,i‚àà {A1}.V=V0+Vint
is the potential energy, consisting of an equilibrium potential, V0, and an inter-
action potential, Vint. We expand V0up to fourth order in anharmonic and
nonlinear coupling terms,
V0=X

i
2Q2
i+X
i,j,k={A1}cijkQiQjQk+X
i,j,k,l ={A1}dijklQiQjQkQl,(3)
where ‚Ñ¶ iis the phonon eigenfrequency, and cijkanddijklare the anharmonic
and nonlinear coupling coefficients. Because the A1modes are fully symmet-
ric, all permutations of modes are allowed by symmetry in the anharmonic
terms. We take into account all single-mode anharmonicities ( ciii,diiii), but
only nonlinear couplings of the high-frequency A1(15.3 THz) mode, which is
resonantly driven, to the other A1modes of the system. See Supplementary
Information Section S4 for the density functional theory calculations of the
coupling coefficients.
The interaction potential, Vint, contains the coupling of the electric dipole
moment of the infrared-active phonon A1modes, pi, to the electric field
component of the laser pulse, E(t), and can be written as
Vint=X
i={A1}piE(t) =X
i={A1}ZiQiE(t), (4)
where the linear polarization of the laser pulse is assumed to be aligned along
the ferroelectric polarization direction of the crystal. Qiis the phonon ampli-
tude as evaluated in Eq. (2) and Ziis the mode effective charge given by
Zi=P
nZ‚àó
nqn,i/‚àöMn.Z‚àó
nis the Born effective charge tensor, qn,ithe phonon
eigenvector, and Mnthe ionic mass of ion n, and the index nruns over all
ions in the unit cell. We model the electric field component of the laser pulse
asE(t) =E0exp[‚àít2/(2(œÑ0/‚àö
8 ln 2)2)] cos( œâ0t) and set its parameters to the
experimental values: a full width at half maximum (FWHM) duration of 250 fs,
a central frequency of 16.9 THz, and a fluence of 12 mJ cm‚àí2(peak electric14
fieldE0= 5.3 MV cm‚àí1). Because œâ0is far off resonance from the three low-
frequency A1modes, only the contribution of the A1(15.3 THz) mode plays a
role in Eq. (4). Finally, the time-dependent electric polarization, P(t), induced
by the displacements of the ions along the coordinates of the infrared-active
A1modes, is given by
P(t) =X
i={A1}pi(t)/Vc, (5)
where Vcis the volume of the unit cell.
We next compute the phonon-induced modulation of the SHG tensor
components. Due to the lack of inversion symmetry in the crystal, any
infrared-active mode can linearly modify the components of œá(2)as

librium tensor components for the ferroelectric contribution, œá(i), from first
principles, see Supplementary Information Section S4.
We finally compute the time-dependent modifications of the exchange inter-
actions, J1andJ2, as well as the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, K, as a result
of the rectified A1mode displacements
