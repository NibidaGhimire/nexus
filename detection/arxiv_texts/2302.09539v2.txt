Abstract  
This study presents  a new machine learning algorithm, named Chemical Environment 
Graph Neural Network (ChemGNN), designed to accelerate materials property prediction 
and advance new materials discovery.  Graphitic carbon nitride (g -C3N4) and its doped 
variants have  gained significant interest for their potential as optical materials. Accurate 
predict ion of their band gaps is crucial for practical applications;  however, traditional 
quantum simulation methods are computationally expensive and challenging to explore 
the vast space of possible doped molecular structures. The proposed ChemGNN leverages 
the learning ability of current graph neural networks (GNNs) to satisfactorily capture the 
characteristics of atoms' chemical environment  under lying complex molecular structures. 
Our experimental results demonstrate more than 100% improvement in band gap 
prediction accuracy over existing GNNs on g-C3N4. Furthermore, the general ChemGNN  
model can precisely foresee band gaps of various doped g -C3N4 structures , making it a 
valuable tool for performing high -throughput prediction in materials design and 
development.

nitride  with high accuracy . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Introduction  
Graphitic carbon nitride (g -C3N4) is one of the oldest synthetic polymers reported in 1834 
by Berzelius and Liebig  (1). Due to its chemical inertness and insolubility in most 
common solvents  (2), g-C3N4 was rarely explored until 2009, when it was used as a 
photocatalyst for hydrogen production through water -splitting  (3). The extraordinary Manuscript Template                                                                                                                                                           Page 2 of 19 
 photocatalytic performance of g -C3N4 is primarily ascribed to its band gap of 2.7 eV  (4), 
which places its conduction band edge above the proton reduction potential, and its 
valence band edge below the water oxidation potential. Inspired by this pioneering study, 
many efforts have been carried out to engineer the g -C3N4’s band gap for various 
photoelectrochemical applications, such as dye -sensitized solar cells  (5), biomedical 
sensors  (6), photodynamic cancer therapy  (7), photothermally accelerated wound healing  
(8), and water purification  (9). For example, a g -C3N4 nanosheet co -doped by sulfur and 
boron reduces the band gap to 2.5 eV, resulting in a more efficient visible -light-driven 
hydrogen production because of a better match between the co -doped g -C3N4’s absorption 
spectrum and the solar power spectrum  (10). In a study of water purification  (9), the band 
gap of a g -C3N4 nanosheet was found to be drastically reduced to 1.9 eV upon the 
substation of a carbon atom by a phosphorous atom  (9). More interestingly, it was 
discovered that the band gap not only depends on a dopant’s element type but also is 
subject to its substitution site. For instance, the substitution by nitrogen at two chemically 
inequivalent carbon sites yields distinctive ba nd gaps of 2.57 eV and 2.90 eV  (9), 
suggesting the importance of atomically precise doping for desired photophysical 
properties of a photocatalyst such as doped g -C3N4. With the prosperous and rapid 
progress of single -atom catalysts over the past decade  (11), the precise tuning of band 
gaps through doping has become feasible, paving the way for a systematic exploration of 
the optimal doping scheme for a given photochemical function of g -C3N4.   
Due to the importance of photophysical  properties in the discovery and design of g-C3N4, 
it is critical to accurately predict them utilizing molecular structures and atomic 
characteristics, as has been widely done in other functional materials. For instance, a 
group of emergent high -temperature superconductors was discovered in doped 
ferroel ectrics due to a remarkable electron -phonon coupling when the dopants move the 
ferroelectrics’ Fermi surface above their conduction band edge  (12). Traditional methods 
use quantum simulations to estimate the band gap, such as ab initio  molecular dynamics 
(AIMD)  (13, 14 ), quantum Monte Carlo  (15, 16 ), and density functional theory  (17, 18 ). 
However, these usually are computationally expensive, particularly for complex systems. 
Recently, large -scale quantum chemical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, 
and high -throughput experiments have produced unprecedented amounts of data for 
analyses. When machine learning is applied to material property prediction, it provides an 
efficient and convenient way of predicting promising molecules from a pool of candidates  
(19) and even proposing novel molecules  (20) through a systematic exploration of 
structure -property relationships in chemical space  (21, 22 ). For example, heptazine, the 
building block of g-C3N4, consists of five chemically unique doping sites. Even if we 
consider only twenty elements as potential dopants for a triply doped g -C3N4, there are 
millions of possible chemical structures, which makes quantum simulation a daunting task 
that can only be resolved by machine learning.  
To predict the optical band gaps of graphitic carbon nitride and its doped variants using 
their molecular structures, the very first yet challenging step is to form a permutation -
invariant representation of the three -dimensional non -Euclidean molecular structures. In 
the context  of machine learning, graphs have been used to fulfill the need to represent 
molecule structures  (23), where atoms are treated as nodes and chemical bonds as edges. 
Graph neural networks (GNNs), such as graph convolutional network (GCN)  (24) and 
message passing neural networks (MPNN)  (25), are popular deep learning models 
designed specifically to learn the graph representation for downstream prediction tasks, 
including classification and regression. GCN has found extensive application in the data Manuscript Template                                                                                                                                                           Page 3 of 19 
 analyses of molecular dynamics  (26) and medical diseases  (27, 28 ), and MPNN 
generalizes multiple categories of spatial GCNs to learn molecular features  (29-31) and 
shows promising results in molecular property prediction  (32-36). Both methods rely on 
aggregating messages from a node and its neighbors to generate the node's representation. 
In MPNN, messages are passed among neighboring nodes via a message function, the 
node embeddings are then updated through a vertex function, and the resulting molecule 
feature representations are generated using a readou t function from the node embeddings 
in the graph.   
The conceptual similarity between GNNs and the underlying chemical bonding topology 
has led to the widespread use of GNNs in predicting quantum mechanical properties. For 
instance, in a crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN)  (37) study, eight 
physical properties, such as band gap and Fermi energy, were accurately predicted for 
46744 crystals. In another equivariant message passing neural network study  (38), 
rotationally equivariant representation was proposed to enable the prediction of tensorial 
properties and molecular spectra. Graph isomorphism network (GIN)  (39) is designed for 
discrete feature space to distinguish isomorphic graph structures in practical applications . 
More recently, the neural equivariant interatomic potentials (NequIP)  (40) was developed 
to perform molecular dynamics simulations at the accuracy of density functional theory 
while demanding a fractional of its computational cost. These studies showcase the 
efficacy of GNNs in capturing complex relationships and spatial arrangements, enhancing 
our understanding of chemical systems and accelerating discovery in materials science and 
quantum chemi stry.  
While the aforementioned GNN models use a single aggregation function ( 𝑆𝑢𝑚  or 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛 ) 
to generate node features, this may not effectively exploit an atom’s chemical 
environment, which affords different band gaps in various molecules through diverse 
interatomic interactions. As a result, such node features are insufficient to identify loca l 
molecular structures. As illustrated in Fig. 1, using a single aggregation function fails to 
differentiate neighborhood messages from different molecular structures (detailed 
explanations are given in the Methods section). It can lead to poor node representations 
that are unable to reflect the local chemical environment characteristics, and thus 
inaccurate structure -dependent property prediction, such as band gaps.  
To address this challenge, we proposed a new Chemical Environment Graph Neural 
Network (ChemGNN) that utilizes chemical environment adaptive learning (CEAL) layers 
to effectively extract deep information from the neighboring environment of each node. 
The C hemGNN model can automatically adapt multiple aggregators to provide valuable 
insights into the chemical environments of atoms to generate representations of nodes . 
Previous works in the field have also explored the use of multiple aggregation functions 
for graph data learning. GraphSAGE  (41) utilizes multiple aggregators to combine node 
features from a fixed -size sampled neighborhood. However, in GraphSAGE, no learnable 
weights are assigned specifically to the aggregated messages, which are then used 
individually in a sequence to update the features of the central node. The order of 
aggregators may impact the model performance. In ChemG NN, we leverage aggregated 
neighborhood messages as a collective input to the MLP for feature updating. Therefore, 
the order of aggregators is not a concern in our approach.  Inspired by cognitive attention, 
graph attention network (GAT)  (42) implicitly assigns different weights to nodes in a 
neighborhood based on their messages.  Manuscript Template                                                                                                                                                           Page 4 of 19 
  
Fig. 1 . Four examples demonstrate that a single aggregator cannot distinguish 
between different g -C3N4 structures . Four aggregation functions ( 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛 , 𝑀𝑎𝑥 , 
 𝑀𝑖𝑛, and 𝑆𝑡𝑑) are employed to aggregate messages (atomic valence electrons) 
from neighboring nodes for the central atom. The bar plots illustrate the 
differences in values among the four aggregations of molecule structure pairs (A 
and B) in a column, respectively. It is  shown that using a single aggregator, 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛  
in (a), 𝑀𝑎𝑥  in (b), 𝑀𝑖𝑛 in (c), and 𝑆𝑡𝑑 in (d) alone fails to differentiate the 
molecule structure pairs in (a) -(d), respectively.  
 
Recently, principal neighborhood aggregation (PNA)  (43) introduced different scalers for 
the aggregated messages of central nodes, but these scalers are based on node degrees and 
are not learnable. It fails to capture the characteristics of atomic interactions when 
chemical composition changes. For example, co nsider the scenario where an atom is 
substituted with a different type of atom. While the node degree does not change, the 
characteristics of atomic interactions do change. This indicates that PNA's information 
acquisition of the chemical environment is no t sufficiently comprehensive . Our approach, 
ChemGNN, addresses this limitation by employing learnable weights applied to the 
aggregation functions, enabling us to explore a more accurate representation of the 
complex interactions within chemical systems. Another related approach, Deepergcn  (44), 
proposed a generalized aggregation function that is parameterized by a continuous 
variable. By learning the variable, the generalized aggregation function can be considered 
as a combination of 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛  and 𝑀𝑎𝑥 . However, it is unclear how to generalize the 
aggregation function to include statistical aggregations such as 𝑉𝑎𝑟 and 𝑆𝑡𝑑. Isotropic 
GNN (EGC -M) (45) employs multiple basis weights and node -wise weights for multiple 
aggregators. While this approach is close to our work, the use of multiple basis weights to 
aggregate messages can result in an excessive number of parameters when dealing with a 
large numb er of atoms in chemical systems.  
Our studies show that the proposed ChemGNN algorithm can predict the optical band 
gaps of g -C3N4 nanosheets and eight of its doped variants more than 100% accurately than 
other GNN models, including GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, MPNN, and PNA. More 
significantly, since the CEAL layers can effectively extract an atom’s chemical

 environment characteristics, the ChemGNN models are expected to afford high prediction 
accuracy for other molecule properties, which largely depend on local interatomic 
interactions.  
 
Results   
Details of the ChemGNN algorithm are given in the Methods section.  Concisely, 
ChemGNN is designed with CEAL layers (adaptive aggregation mechanism) to improve 
the information extracting ability. The architecture of a CEAL layer is illustrated in Fig. 2. 
A set of aggregators (detailed in Table 2) are exploited to collect various aspects of the 
chemical environment attributes of a node. The weights are adaptively learned in the 
training process to determine the optimal combination of aggregation functions based on 
the chemical environments of atoms. These chemical environment features are assigned 
with adaptively learnable weights to reflect their importance in determining the central 
node’s represen tation. Compared with other GNN models, ChemGNN can gain effective 
insight into the local chemical environments to facilitate molecular property prediction. To 
demonstrate the ad vantage of the proposed model, g -C3N4 and its eight doped variants are 
selected as the research objects to predict their optical band gaps.

weights are assigned to the aggregators to reflect their importance in determining 
the central node’s representation. MLPs (multilayer perceptron) are applied as 
pre/post -processing layers to enhance the expressiveness of a CEAL layer.  
 
The experiments were conducted using PyTorch Geometric, implemented on an NVIDIA 
RTX 3090 Ti GPU with 24GB RAM . A global sum pooling was employed as the readout 
layer for all models. The training process for all models utilized the Adam optimizer  (46) 
with a plateau learning rate scheduler. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, with a 
drop factor of 0.5. The patience for the learning rate scheduler was set to 30 epochs, and a 
lower bound of 0.0001 was imposed on the learning rate. The batch size is 64~128,  and 
the maximum number of epochs is 400. To avoid overfitting, early stopping is utilized 
with a patience of 30 epochs. Each dataset is randomly partitioned into the training (60%), 
validation (10%), and testing (30%) sets, respectively. To ensu re the robustness of the 
results, all reported findings in this section were based on five independent experiments.  
All methods utilize the same features of nodes and edges for comparison, but the 
processing methods for these features vary from model to model.

 Water and Heptazine  
Aiming to benchmark our proposed ChemGNN model against GCN, we first compare 
their performance on the band gaps of water and heptazine, which are the most common 
molecule and the building block of g -C3N4, respectively. Our approach shows its 
advantages over GCN as molecular structures become slightly complex from water to 
heptazine. Water is the most common solvent of g -C3N4, and it only consists of one 
oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms (Fig. 3(a)). For such a simple molecule, excellent 
performance is expe cted from any established machine learning algorithm due to the low 
complexity and high symmetry of water’s molecular structure. In Fig. 3(b) and 3(c), 
nearly all data points fall very close to the diagonal line, illustrating a remarkable 
agreement between the predicted and true values obtained by both GCN and ChemGNN 
models. The average predicted optical band gap of ~10.8 eV is well in line with wat er’s 
famous set of narrow bands near 115 nm, corresponding to a Rydberg transition at 10.7 eV  
(47).  
Unlike the three -atom H 2O, heptazine has six oxygen, seven nitrogen, and three hydrogen 
atoms (Fig. 3(d)). Due to its notably increased degrees of freedom, a more advanced 
machine learning algorithm is required to accurately map its molecular structures to its 
optical band gaps. As presented in Fig. 3(e) and 3(f), GCN exhibits a cluster pattern, 
whereas ChemGNN produces a dense linear regression pattern. This distinction highlights 
the superior performance of ChemGNN compared to GCN. More specifically, our model 
has a much higher fitting coefficient (R2) value than GCN (0.213 vs. 0.913). Our model 
also yields a lower mean absolute error (MAE) than GCN (0.031 eV vs. 0.071 eV). The 
average predicted optical band gap of ~3.8 eV for heptazine is consistent with the 
experimental value of 3.7 eV  (48).

g-C3N4 and its Doped Variants  
As shown in Fig. 4(a), a pristine g -C3N4 nanosheet consists of heptazine units connected 
by tertiary nitrogen atoms. For each heptazine unit, there are three chemically inequivalent 
nitrogen sites, (N 1, N2, and  N3 in Fig. 4(b)), while the number of chemically inequivalent 
carbon sites is two (C 1 and C 2 in Fig. 4(b)). In the present study, we explored the 
substitution of nitrogen for carbon and phosphorous, in addition to the doping of 
phosphorous at the carbon sites. Each doped compound is labeled as A →B, where A is the 
doping site and B is the dopant’s element. For instance,  1→P refers to the doped g -C3N4 
wherein the nitrogen atom at an N 1 site is substituted by a phosphorous atom. As a result, 
nine g -C3N4 compounds, including the undoped ones, were investigated. Specifically, 
each compound is represented by a 3 ×3 supercell (Fig. 4(a)) with an experimental crystal 
structure of a     Å, b     Å, and γ 6 ° determined by X -ray diffraction  (49). 
Since the band gap of a g -C3N4 nanosheet is sensitive to its atomistic structure, which 
notably changes upon thermal fluctuation, a large ensemble of atomistic configurations 
obtained from our quantum -based AIMD simulations is needed to fully understand the 
structure -band gap relations hip by accounting for the thermal effect, especially at room 
temperature. Therefore, approximately 10,000 atomistic configurations were randomly 
extracted for each compound from a 1 -ns AIMD trajectory.

3×3 supercell of g -C3N4. The carbon and nitrogen atoms are colored cyan and 
blue, respectively. (b) Designated doping sites (i.e., N 1, N2, N3, C1, and C 2) in the 
heptazine unit of an undoped g -C3N4 nanosheet.  
 
Nine datasets of approximately 110,000 atomistic configurations and their optical band 
gaps of the pristine g-C3N4 nanosheet and its eight doped variants were obtained by the 
AIMD simulations.  Those datasets ( Undoped, C1P, C2P, N1C, N2C, N3C, N1P, N2P, and 
N3P, see detail in subsection g-C3N4 and Its Doped Variants) have 22237, 10165, 10715, 
10305, 13217, 10570, 13809, 12981, and 11781 atomistic configurations, respectively. For 
the odd -electron datasets (C1P, C2P, N1C, N2C, and N3C), the band gaps for both  the 
alpha and beta spin channels were calculated due to the broken spin symmetry. By 
      Manuscript Template                                                                                                                                                           Page 8 of 19 
 contrast, for the even -electron datasets (Undoped, N1P, N2P, and N3P), only the band 
gaps for the alpha spin channel were evaluated due to their spin -paired orbitals.  
We applied our ChemGNN model to predict the band gaps of g-C3N4 and its doped 
variants . A ChemGNN model with 4 CEAL layers (see the Discussion section for the 
selection of layer number) was used to perform optical band gap prediction. The following 
chemical characteristics were used as the initial node embedding, i.e., coordinates of 
atoms in space, atom type, and  electron numbers on the 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, and 3d angular 
momentum channels . For detailed information on model settings and fine -tuned 
parameter s for each model, please refer to supplementary Table S1.  
As a first step, to illustrate the predictive power of our proposed approach on a single 
category of g -C3N4 molecular structures, the ChemGNN  model was trained and tested on 
the N1C dataset. The dataset contains 10,305 molecular structures and their optical band 
gaps of the alpha and beta spin channels obtained by AIMD simulations. Figures 5(a) and 
5(b) illustrate the accurate prediction capabi lity of our proposed ChemGNN model for the 
optical band gaps of the alpha (red) and beta (blue) spin channels of N1C. In comparison 
to GCN with an MAE of 0.123 eV, our ChemGNN model reduces the MAE to 0.035 eV, 
demonstrating remarkable performance enhancem ent. In Fig. 5(c), the predicted 
distribution of optical band gaps aligns nearly perfectly with that of true distribution even 
for odd -electron systems, such as N1C, featuring distinct band gaps for alpha and beta 
spin channels.

(blue) spin channels, using the GCN (a) and ChemGNN (b), respectively. (c)

Secondly, to demonstrate the superior capabilities of ChemGNN in accurately predicting 
the optical band gaps of molecules with diverse categorical structures, our model was 
trained using all nine datasets containing g -C3N4 and its eight doped variants. After the 
model was trained, testing data containing a mixture of the above nine categories of 
structures were fed into the model and their optical band gaps were predicted. The 
performance of the proposed model was compared with those of other established GN N

 our ChemGNN over five experiments is 106%, 84%, 116%, 10 0%, and 38% lower 
respectively than those of GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, MPNN, and PNA.  Furthermore, as 
shown in Fig. 6(b-g), the proposed model yields optical band gap predictions much more 
closely concentrated along the diagonal line, indicating the superiority of ChemGNN over 
other established     models. All these results strongly affirm our model’s salient 
capabilitie s to accurately extract information from the chemical environment of atoms for 
the purpose of mapping molecular structures to optical band gaps. Importantly, this ability 
to effectively extract the local chemical environment information would enable the 
accurate prediction of any other molecular properties that are subject to atomic 
interactions, accelerating the experimental discovery of novel materials with desired 
functions.

Discussion   
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ChemGNN model consistently 
exhibited superior performance with respect to mean absolute error and R2 of optical band 
gap predictions for molecule structures ranging from simple (such as water and heptazine) 
to complex ( g-C3N4 and its eight doped variants). To further explore the category -wise 
performance of optical band gap prediction, our trained model used in Fig. 6 was tested on 
single -category data. Fig. 7 displays category -wise MAEs and predicted band gaps. Most 
of the predicted band gaps are prevalent along the diagonal line, evidenced by the high 
density of predicted data points. The category -wise performance of the proposed model 
with other established GNNs are listed in Table 1. The proposed model constantly yields 
significantly lower prediction errors than other GNN models. We also performed ablation 
studies to examine the isolated effect of the adaptive aggregation mechanism, see Fig. S1 
in the supplementary . Moreover, to  validate the effectiveness and applicability of our 
model, we evaluate its performance on two well -known  datasets: QM9 and FePt , see Fig. 
S2 in the supplementary . Fine -tuned m odel hyperparameters  are listed in  Table  S1 of the 
supplementary.  
In conclusion, the proposed ChemGNN model uses the adaptive aggregation mechanism 
to extract deep insight from  atoms’ chemical environment, addressing the limits of using 
single aggregation. Experimental results show that the proposed model can significantly 
improve the optical band gap prediction of graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets and the 
doped variants. More over, the proposed model's learning power is promising, and it can be 
potentially applied to predicting other structure -dependent molecular proper ties, such as 
nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts. Overall, the ChemGNN model offers a 
promising approach to enhance predictions of molecular properties, which could have 
broad applications in various fields, including material science, drug discove ry, and 
computational chemistry.  Manuscript Template                                                                                                                                                           Page 11 of 19

Quantum Mechanics Simulation for the Band Gap of Doped g -C3N4  
Unless otherwise specified, all ab initio simulations in the present study were performed 
by the open -source CP2K software  (50) with Goedecker -Teter -Hutter (GTH) 
pseudopotential  (51), Heyd -Scuseria -Ernzerhof (HSE06) exchange -correlation functional  
(52), and polarized -valence -double -𝜁 (PVDZ) basis set  (53). Our chosen HSE06 range -
separated hybrid functional is justified by our calculated band gap of 2.78 eV for the 
optimized undoped g -C3N4 nanosheet. Moreover, for each of our selected atomistic 
configurations, its angular -momentum -resolved Mulliken charges  (54) were also 
calculated for their direct relevance to the electron distribution that governs the band gap. 
As a result, the atomic coordinates and angular -momentum -resolved Mulliken charges 
were used as the input data for our machine -learning model to predic t the band gaps of the 
undoped and doped g -C3N4 nanosheets.  
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)  
A graph 𝐺 consists of a vertex (also called a node) set 𝑉 and an edge set ℇ, i.e., 𝐺 
 𝑉,ℇ . The topology of a graph is described by the adjacency matrix  𝐷, which is a square 
matrix of size 𝑀×𝑀 in which 𝑀 is the number of nodes. 𝐷 𝑢,𝑣    if node 𝑢 is 
connected to node  𝑣, otherwise 𝐷 𝑢,𝑣   . A node is represented by a feature 
(embedding) vector 𝑋∈ℝ𝑚×1 containing the embedded node properties, in which 𝑚 is 
the number of properties. Graphs are suitable for representing molecule structures because 
they are permutation invariant, i.e., when a molecule rotates in 3D space, the graph 
representing its structure does not change. When a graph is used to represen t the structure 
of a molecule, an atom is represented as a node and a chemical bond between atoms is 
represented as an edge. Atomic characteristics are used as a node’s initial embedding. 
GNN is a framew ork that computationally learns how to propagate information across the Manuscript Template                                                                                                                                                           Page 13 of 19 
 graph to compute node embeddings for downstream tasks such as optical band gap 
prediction. A GNN model consists of multiple layers. A GNN layer is a two -step 
computation process, including message computing and message aggregating. The two 
steps are define d as follows in equations ( 1) and ( 2). 
𝑚𝑢 𝑘+1  𝑚𝑠𝑔 𝑘+1 (𝑋𝑢 𝑘 ),𝑢∈{𝑁 𝑣 ∪𝑣}             (1) 
𝑋𝑣 𝑘+1  𝑎𝑔𝑔 𝑘+1  {𝑚𝑢 𝑘+1 ,𝑢∈{𝑁 𝑣 ∪𝑣}}               (2) 
In Eq. ( 1), 𝑁 𝑣  is the set of neighboring nodes of node 𝑣, 𝑋𝑢 𝑘  is the node feature at the 
𝑘𝑡ℎ GNN layer. 𝑚𝑠𝑔 𝑘+1  and 𝑚𝑢 𝑘+1  are the message function and message of node 𝑢 at 
the  𝑘+  𝑡ℎ layer, respectively. In Eq. ( 2), 𝑎𝑔𝑔 𝑘+1  and 𝑋𝑣 𝑘+1  are the aggregation 
function and feature vector of node 𝑣 at the  𝑘+  𝑡ℎ layer. Different instantiations of 
GNN utilize various message and aggregation functions. Compared to established GNN 
models, such as GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, and MPNN, the proposed ChemGNN model 
can effectively learn the deep features of nodes from graphs to  significantly improve the 
structure -dependent property predictions, such as the optical band gaps of g-C3N4 and its 
doped variants.  
Chemical Environment Graph Neural Network (ChemGNN)  
As discussed in the Introduction section, Fig. 1 uses the atomic valence electrons as the 
sole node feature to illustrate the difference |∆| between these aggregators for four distinct 
scenarios. In Fig. 1(a), the primary difference between structures A and B is the 
substitution of a carbon atom for a phosphorous atom. The more electropositive 
phosphorous atom loses approximately one electron to its neighboring nitrogen atoms, 
eventually carrying 𝑎+  net charge. Since a neutral phosphorous atom carries one more 
valence electron than its carbon counterpart, the N1→P doping happens to preserve the 
mean valence electrons of the three atoms connec ted to the central nitrogen atom, 
resulting in a nearly negligible |∆𝑀𝑖𝑛| of 0.0002. By contrast, the N -P bond polarity is 
substantially greater than the N -C bond, affording a large |∆𝑀𝑎𝑥| of 0.3069 due to more 
electrons accumulated at the central nitrogen atom. In Fig. 1(b), a nitrogen atom is 
replaced by a carbon atom. Since a more electronegative nitrogen atom always carries 
more valence electrons than a more electropositive carbon atom, the N2→C replacement  
minimized |∆𝑀𝑎𝑥| whereas |∆𝑀𝑖𝑛| surged to 1.0434 for a great change of valence electrons 
on the central carbon atom. Contrarily, the most electropositive tertiary carbon atom is 
preserved in N2→C substitution (Fig. 1(c)) to furnish zero |∆𝑀𝑖𝑛| while changing a 
secondary nitrogen to a tertiary one renders a large |∆𝑀𝑎𝑥| of 1.0881. In Fig. 1(d), |∆𝑆𝑡𝑑| is 
expected to be small as both central atoms are bonded to others with the same elements 
regardless of their type. Nevertheless, the notable electronegativity difference between 
carbon and nitrogen again yields large values of |∆𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛|, |∆𝑀𝑎𝑥|, and |∆𝑀𝑖𝑛|.  
As presented in Fig. 1(a), if the 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛  aggregator is used alone, the message received 
from the central nitrogen atom’s chemical environment is insufficient to differentiate the 
pair of molecular structures. Figs. 1(b), 1(c), and 1(d) further illustrated that using only 
𝑀𝑎𝑥 , 𝑀𝑖𝑛, and 𝑆𝑡𝑑 aggregators in the cases respectively, cannot differentiate the 
molecular structures of the pair in each scenario. A lack of ability to differentiate 
structures will result in poor performance to predict structure -dependent molecule 
properties, such as op tical band gaps. Therefore, to extract the chemical environment 
information effectively, it is proposed to exploit a scheme that adaptively employs Manuscript Template                                                                                                                                                           Page 14 of 19 
 multiple aggregators. These aggregators are assigned learnable weights to represent the 
interaction between atoms and their chemical environments. In this work, a Chemical 
Environment Graph Neural Network with adaptive learning is proposed to fulfill this task. 
In standard GNNs, node and edge features pass through an MLP before the aggregation 
step. However, aggregators allow for more expressive power in capturing complex 
relationships and interactions between nodes in a graph. This is the intuition behind 
MPNNs,  including GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN, EGC, and ChemGNN. Furthermore, 
aggregators provide a mechanism for nodes to exchange and fuse information with their 
neighbors. Different aggregation functions can capture different types of interactions and 
behaviors.  
The overall framework of ChemGNN for optical band gap predictions of g-C3N4 
nanosheet and its doped variants is illustrated in Fig. 8. The model takes the molecular 
structures as input and predicts the optical band gap (a graph -level property) of the 
molecules. Specifically, atoms are interpreted as nodes and chemical bonds are interpreted 
as edges in a graph. A stack of CEAL layers is exploited to  aggregate messages from 
neighboring nodes to extract the underlying node embeddings. The edge features are fir st 
transformed linearly by the edge encoder to have the same size of node feature vectors. 
The extracted node embeddings obtained by the last CEAL layer are sent to a readout 
layer to form a graph -level representation. The graph representation is then used  to predict 
the optical band gaps of  g-C3N4 and its doped variants.

environments.  
 
Adaptive Aggregation Mechanism  
Our model further investigates on top of the classical GNN model PNA.  In PNA, multiple 
aggregators are introduced. However, these aggregators have equal weights before being 
processed by degree -based scalers. While degree -based scalers capture the topology of 
graphs and have proven beneficial for networks such as social netw orks, they may not be 
sufficient for accurately learning representations of atomic interactions in chemical 
compounds, which are crucial for predicting molecular properties. Consider the doping 
operation in chemicals, where an atom is replaced by a different type of atom. For 
instance, the replacement of the carbon atom in CO by an oxygen atom turns the molecule 
into O 2.  hile the bonding topology does not change after this C→O substitution, the 
interatomic interactions do.  To effectively learn representations of atomic interactions, we 
propose employing learnable weights that are applied to the aggregators. This approach 
allows for adaptive aggregation and enables the model to capture variations in atomic 
interactions, lead ing to improved molecular property predictions. These weights are 
Manuscript Template                                                                                                                                                           Page 15 of 19 
 adaptively learned in the training process to determine the optimal combination of 
aggregation functions based on the local chemical environments of atoms. It is achieved 
by assigning learnable weights to a finite collection of aggregators and formulating an 
arbitrary linear combination of them, written as equations (3) -(6).

CEAL is a robust and compelling instantiation of the general GNN framework. 𝑋𝑖 0 ∈
ℝ10×1 is the initial node feature vector, consisting of atom coordinates in space, the atom 
type, and the electron numbers on the 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p and 3d angular momentum 
channels. The architecture of a CEAL layer is illustrated in Fig. 2. 
Table 2 lists the aggregation functions investigated in this work. The aggregator set 𝒜 
{𝑆𝑢𝑚,𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛,𝑀𝑎𝑥,𝑀𝑖𝑛,𝑆𝑡𝑑} contains diverse aggregate functions to extract various 
characteristics of an atom’s chemical environment.  Our candidate function set contains 
aggregate functions with sufficient diversity to expand the search space and improve 
performance.  The first type of aggregators is mean aggregation 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑢 𝑋𝑘  and sum 
aggregation 𝑆𝑢𝑚𝑢 𝑋𝑘 , representing the average and total incoming message of node 𝑢 at 
layer 𝑘. 𝑑𝑢  |𝑁 𝑢 | is the number of neighboring nodes. The second type of aggregators 
is maximum and minimum aggregations, 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑢 𝑋𝑘  and 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑢 𝑋𝑘 , through which the 
largest and smallest neighbor incoming messages are selected. The third type of 
aggregators is the standard deviation or variance aggregations, 𝑆𝑡𝑑𝑢 𝑋𝑘  or 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑢 𝑋𝑘 , 
which quantify the distribution characteristics (e.g., diversity) of adjacent nodes. In 
addition to the above common aggregators, our CEAL layer can integrate more 
aggregators, such as normalized moments aggregations, 𝑆𝑘𝑒𝑤𝑢 𝑋𝑘 , and 𝐾𝑢𝑟𝑢 𝑋𝑘 , 
which are based on the 𝑛𝑡ℎ root normalization and represents skewness  𝑛    and Manuscript Template                                                                                                                                                           Page 16 of 19
