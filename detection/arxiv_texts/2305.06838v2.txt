Abstract
This work investigates several key aspects of a non–commutative theory with mass deformation.
We calculate thermodynamic properties of the system and compare our results with recent litera-
ture. We examine the quasinormal modes of massless scalar perturbations using two approaches:
the WKB approximation and the P¨ oschl–Teller fitting method. Our results indicate that stronger
non–commutative parameters lead to slower damping oscillations of gravitational waves and higher
partial absorption cross sections. Furthermore, we study the geodesics of massless and massive par-
ticles, highlighting that the non–commutative parameter Θ significantly impacts the paths of light
and event horizons. Also, we calculate the shadows, which show that larger values of Θ correspond
to larger shadow radii, and provide some constraints on Θ applying the observation of Sgr A∗from
the Event Horizon Telescope. Finally, we explore the deflection angle in this context.

General relativity (GR) is a geometric theory of gravity that exhibits intrinsically nonlin-
ear behavior. As a result, exact solutions to its field equations can be challenging to solve,
even when additional symmetries and restrictions are taken into account [1, 2]. A common
approach is encountered in the literature in order to overcome this issue: the weak field
approximation. This method greatly simplifies the field equations, making them more man-
ageable to work with, and gives rise to gravitational waves, which are of significant interest
for studying stability, Hawking radiation of black holes (BHs), and the interactions of BHs
with their surroundings in astrophysical scenarios.
Understanding gravitational waves and their associated characteristics is crucial for study-
ing a wide range of physical processes, including cosmological events that took place in the
early universe and astrophysical phenomena such as the evolution of stellar oscillations [3–
5] and binary systems [6–9]. These waves exhibit a range of intensities and characteristic
modes, and their spectral properties depend on the generating phenomenon [10]. Also, the
emission of gravitational waves from BHs is a prominent aspect worthy to be investigated.
When a BH is formed through the gravitational collapse of matter, it emanates radiation
that includes a bundle of characteristic frequencies unrelated to the process which gener-
ated it. These perturbations are called the quasinormal modes. More so, the weak field
approximation has been widely used in the literature to investigate the quasinormal modes
of BHs in GR [11–25], Ricci–based gravity theories [26–28], Lorentz violation [29, 30], and
other related fields [31–35].
Significant progress has been made in the development of gravitational wave detectors,
which have enabled the detection of gravitational waves emitted from various physical pro-
cesses [36–39]. Ground–based interferometers such as VIRGO, LIGO, TAMA-300, and EO-
600 have been used to achieve this milestone [40–43]. These detector accuracies have im-
proved over time, bringing them closer to the true sensitivity scheme [44]. In addition,
they have brought about valuable information on the composition of astrophysical objects
such as boson and neutron stars. One of the most remarkable aspects of these processes
is their connection to BH physics. The gravitational radiation emitted by a perturbed BH
carries a signature that can directly verify its existence [45]. Furthermore, the stability of
Schwarzschild BHs was initially studied by Regge and Wheeler, followed by Zerilli [46–48].
2In recent years, the study of gravitational solutions involving scalar fields has gained much
attention due to their intriguing and distinctive characteristics, leading to many astrophys-
ical applications. Among them, BHs with nontrivial scalar fields appear to contradict the
well–known no–hair theorem [49], long–lived scalar field patterns [50], boson stars [51–53],
and exotic astrophysical scenarios in the form of gravastars [54–56]. Additionally, many
feasible phenomena can be derived by considering the Klein–Gordon scalar fields on curved
backgrounds, such as BH bombs [57–59] and superradiance [60].
The formalism used to describe the geometry of spacetime in GR lacks a bound on the
precision of distance measurements, which is believed to be given by the Planck length. To
address this issue, one common approach is using the concept of non–commutative (NC)
spacetimes. NC geometry is motivated by string/M–theory [61–63], and it has important
applications in supersymmetric Yang–Mills theories within the superfield formalism [64–66].
Moreover, the Seiberg–Witten map is typically used to introduce non–commutativity in the
context of gravity by gauging an appropriate group [67]. In the NC framework, significant
progress has been made in the study of BHs [68–76], including their evaporating aspects
[77, 78] and thermodynamic properties [69, 79–82]. Besides these ones, thermal aspects of
field theories have also been calculated in different scenarios [83–96].
The non–commutativity of spacetime is a fundamental concept in modern theoretical
physics, described by the relation [ xµ, xν] =iΘµν, where xµis the spacetime coordinates
and Θµνis an anti–symmetric constant tensor. Different methods have been proposed to
incorporate non–commutativity into theories of gravity, including the use of the NC gauge
de Sitter (dS) group, SO(4,1), in conjunction with the Poincar´ e group, ISO(3,1), through
the Seiberg-–Witten (SW) map approach. This formalism has been employed to obtain a
deformed metric for the Schwarzschild BH by Chaichian et al. [97]. Alternatively, Nicolini
et al. [98] showed that the NC effect can also be modeled as an effect on the matter
source term without altering the Einstein tensor part of the field equation. This can be
achieved by replacing the point–like mass density on the right–hand side of the Einstein
equation with a Gaussian smeared or Lorentzian distribution, with ρΘ=M(4πΘ)−3
2e−r2
4Θ
andρΘ=M√
Θπ−3
2(r2+πΘ)−2, respectively.
On the contrary, recent data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has ushered in
a new era of exploration into the shadows and gravitational lensing around black holes,
attracting significant attention. For example, in reference [99], the authors introduced Sym-
3mergent gravity, and its charged variant was subsequently derived and examined, with a
focus on its properties, such as the Hawking temperature. Furthermore, this study delved
into the constraints imposed on Symmergent gravity by analyzing its shadow properties in
conjunction with data from EHT. Subsequently, we applied these findings to the weak field
regime, utilizing the Gauss–Bonnet theorem to obtain the weak deflection angle.
Additionally, in the same metric context, quasinormal modes and greybody factors were
investigated using the WKB approach, as detailed in [100]. The influence of Symmergent
gravity on null geodesics, which in turn affects the shadow radius and associated observ-
ables, was explored [101]. Moreover, other important effects on the shadow and certain
thermodynamic properties have been examined [102].
On top of that, the BH shadows were investigated in asymptotically safe gravity [103].
It was also investigated the quasinormal modes of BHs in f(Q) gravity [100]. In [104], the
authors considered a spacetime metric for a BH surrounded by wave dark matter, and then
they found the shadow radius of this setup. In general, some properties such as shadow,
lensing, quasinormal modes, greybody bounds, and neutrino propagation by dyonic modified
Maxwell BHs were studied in [105].
Furthermore, it was scrutinized a model to examine the influence of torsion on the proper-
ties of charged black holes, including their shadow, deflection angle, and greybody radiation
[101]. This study was conducted in the context of both M87∗andSgr.A∗, utilizing data
from the Event Horizon Telescope. Apart from that, the same characteristics were assessed
for black holes governed by non–linear electrodynamics, along with a thin accretion disk
[106].
In [107], the authors focused on the exploration of hairy black holes generated through
gravitational decoupling. They analyzed the time–domain profiles of massless scalar fields,
electromagnetic fields, and axial gravitational perturbations within these black hole space-
times. The study also involved the determination of quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies
using the Prony method, 6th and 13th-order WKB approximations, and the discussion of
greybody factors and high–energy absorption cross–sections, employing the sinc approxima-
tion.
In particular, it was first first examined a non-spinning black hole metric within the
Dehnen profile [108]. The authors then extended this study to include spin parameters,
investigating their effects on various black hole properties, such as the horizon structure,
4ergoregions, geodesics, shadow, and weak deflection angle.
In the context of modified theories of gravity, the BH shadows have been found for a
variety of different models. In particular, [109] introduced a new spherically symmetric
solution in the generalized Einstein–Cartan–Kibble–Sciama gravity theory, which was used
to investigate weak gravitational lensing and its resulting shadow. Furthermore, in [110], the
authors computed the shadow and deflection angle for the Kerr–Newman–Kasuya spacetime.
This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II, we briefly review the framework of imple-
menting the non–commutativity through the Schwarzschild metric. After that, we propose
a new approach via the mass deformation for doing so. In Sec. III, we calculate the ther-
modynamic properties of the NC BH and compare our results with the previous results
encountered in the literature. In Sec. IV, we provide the quasinormal frequencies of such a
BH hole using fundamentally the methods: WKB approximation and P¨ oschl–Teller fitting
approach. In Sec. V, we study the grey–body factor and the absorption cross section. In
Sec. VI, we examine the geodesic path of massless and massive particles; also, we display the
effect of the non–commutativity to the photon sphere. In Sec. VII, we demonstrate how the
shadow radius depends on the Θ parameter of non–commutative theory and provide some
constraints on Θ applying the observation of Sgr A* from EHT. In Sec. VIII, we investigate
the deflection angle. Finally, IX, we exhibit our conclusion.
II. SCHWARZSCHILD BLACK HOLE WITH DEFORMED MASS
In Ref. [111], the authors constructed a deformation of the gravitational field by gauging
the NC de Sitter SO(4,1) group and using the Seiberg–Witten map. They calculated the
deformed gravitational gauge potentials (tetrad fields) ˆ ea
µ(x,Θ) by contracting the NC group
SO(4,1) to the Poincar´ e one ISO(3,1). They applied these potentials to the Schwarzschild
BH and arrived at a deformed Schwarzschild metric with a non–commutativity parameter
up to the second order, given as follows:
ˆg00=g00−α(8r−11α)
16r4Θ2+O(Θ4),
ˆg11=g11−α(4r−3α)
16r2(r−α)2Θ2+O(Θ4),
ˆg22=g22−2r2−17αr+17α2
32r(r−α)Θ2+O(Θ4),
ˆg33=g33−(r2+αr−α2) cosθ−α(2r−α)
16r(r−α)Θ2+O(Θ4).(1)
5In the context of this study, the parameter αis defined as α=2GM
c2, where Gis the
gravitational constant, Mis the mass of the BH, and cis the speed of light. The symbol ˆ gµν
represents the deformed metric tensor in spherical coordinates, while gµνstands for the well–
known Schwarzschild metric. To obtain the deformed Schwarzschild event horizon radius,
we set ˆ g00equal to zero, as done in Ref. [78]. This leads to the following expression:
rsΘ= 2M+3Θ2
32M, (2)
where rs= 2Mis the known Schwarzschild BH. We attribute the deformed NC mass of the
Schwarzschild BH to its radius as rsΘ= 2MΘ, which entails to a newly defined deformed
mass as:
MΘ=M+3
64MΘ2. (3)
The standard Schwarzschild metric is used in this work with a deformed NC mass Eq. (3).
This approach allows us to investigate the thermodynamic properties of the Schwarzschild
BH and we compare our results with previous studies concerning the metric deformation
instead [78]. As it is straightforward to note, when the NC parameter approaches zero, the
well–known Schwarzschild mass is obtained.
III. THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF NON–COMMUTATIVE
SCHWARZSCHILD BLACK HOLE WITH DEFORMED MASS
We begin our analysis by focusing on the temperature of the NC Schwarzschild BH.
To do so, we consider the deformed event horizon radius, rhΘ, in the well–known Hawking
temperature relation for Schwarzschild BH, given by T=1
8πM. Using Eq. (3), the modified
temperature reads:
TΘ=1
4π√g00g11dg00
dr
r=rhΘ≈1
8πM
1−3
64M2Θ2
. (4)
It implies that the NC temperature is dependent on the NC parameter as lim
Θ2→0TΘ=T.
To examine the effect of Θ on this thermal quantity, we have plotted the temperature versus
mass for Θ2= 0 (the usual case of Schwarzschild BH) and Θ2= 0.04 in Fig. 1. The
figure demonstrates that non–commutativity induces a substantial change in temperature.
In contrast to the Schwarzschild BH, in our case, there exists a minimal non–zero mass at
60.1 0.2 0.3 0.400.20.40.6Figure 1: The original temperature and modified NC temperature as functions of mass for

the final stage of BH evaporation. The value of this remnant mass depends on the Θ value.
As the metric parameter does not change in this approach, we can find the horizon area
by using the standard Schwarzschild–like metric. The area of the event horizon can be
written as:
AΘ=ˆ ˆ√g22g33dθdφ= 4πr2
hΘ. (5)
By using it, we can calculate the deformed entropy of the BH as follows:
SΘ=AΘ

Furthermore, the heat capacity can also be addressed to:

using two different methods: mass and metric deformation. The first column corresponds to
the results obtained by considering a known Schwarzschild metric with a NC deformed mass
given by Eq. (3), while the second one accounts for the properties found using a deformed
Schwarzschild metric.

IV. QUASINORMAL FREQUENCIES IN NON–COMMUTATIVE MODEL
During the ringdown phase of a BH merger for instance, we can infer about the quasinor-
malmodes. These ones are unique oscillation patterns of the system and are independent
of the initial perturbations. The reason for this is that they represent the free oscillations of
the spacetime, which do not rely on the initial conditions. In contrast to the normal modes,
thequasinormal modes correspond to an open system, resulting in the dissipation of energy
through the emission of gravitational waves. These modes can be described as poles of the
complex Green function. To calculate the quasinormal frequencies, we need to find wave
equation solutions for a system governed by a background metric gµν. However, obtaining
analytical solutions for such modes is typically not feasible.
Various methods have been proposed in the literature to obtain analytical solutions for
thequasinormal modes. One of the most well–known approaches is the WKB (Wentzel–
Kramers–Brillouin) method, which was first introduced by Will and Iyer [112, 113]. Later,
Konoplya improved this method to the sixth order [114]. In our calculations, we consider
perturbations through the scalar field. Therefore, we can express the Klein–Gordon equation
in a curved spacetime as follows:
1√−g∂µ(gµν√−g∂νΦ) = 0 , (8)
where we shall use the NC Schwarzschild BH metric constructed by applying the modified
NC mass

values of Θ2

In this work, we focus on studying the scalar field perturbations. In addition, we take
advantage of spherical symmetry by decomposing it in the following manner:
Φ(t, r, θ, φ ) =∞X
l=0lX
m=−lr−1Ψlm(t, r)Ylm(θ, φ), (11)
where Ylm(θ, φ) denotes the spherical harmonics. Substituting the decomposition encoun-
tered in Eq. (11) into Eq. (8), we shall have a wave–like equation:
−∂2Ψ
∂t2+∂2Ψ
∂r∗2+Veff(r)Ψ = 0 , (12)
where we introduce the tortoise coordinate r∗, which runs from −∞ to +∞all over the
spacetime. We define it as d r∗=p
[1/fΘ(r)]dr. Although the backreaction effects are
interesting to study, we do not address this feature in this manuscript. Here, Veff(r) denotes
theRegge–Wheeler potential or effective potential, encoding the geometry of the BH given
by

. (13)
To visualize such a potential in tortoise coordinate for various NC parameters, we display
Fig. 2. It illustrates a notable trend caused by the non–commutativity of the spacetime: as
Θ2increases, the maximum value of the effective potential decreases. In the next section,
9we will effectively perform calculations to determine the quasinormal modes of the scalar
field in the presence of non–commutativity.
Notice that the Schr¨ odinger–like equation (12) cannot be solved analytically , so that
extensive analytical andnumerical methods have been proposed to calculate the quasinormal
modes from BHs. One of the most effective methods is to approximate the effective potential
analytically by an exactly solvable potential. Several semi–analytical approaches have been
suggested to find the QNMs, including the methods proposed by Mashhoon and others
[115–117]. Mashhoon’s technique is one of the simplest ones, where the effective potential
is substituted with the P¨ oschl–Teller potential [115]. within another approach, the such a
potential is replaced by the Rosen–Morse function, which gives an analytical solution for the
radial wave function [118]. The continued fraction method is another well–known procedure
that was proposed by Leaver [119–121].
Our analysis employs both the P¨ oschl–Teller fitting approach and the 6th order WKB
method to examine the QNMs of a Schwarzschild–like BH in the context of a NC theory via
the mass deformation. Through this approach, we strive to gain a deeper understanding of
the impact of noncommutativity on the system.
A. Quasinormal modes via WKB method
The objective of this section is to derive stationary solutions, which are obtained under
the assumption that Ψ( t, r) follows the form e−iωtψ(r), where ωrepresents frequency. Using
this assumption, the time-independent part of Eq. (12) can be separated into the following
form:
∂2ψ
∂r∗2−
ω2−Veff(r)
ψ= 0. (14)
To solve this equation, appropriate boundary conditions must be considered. In this case,
acceptable solutions are those that are purely ingoing near the horizon:
ψin(r∗)∼

Cl(ω)e−iωr∗(r∗→ −∞ )
A(−)
l(ω)e−iωr∗+A(+)
l(ω)e+iωr∗(r∗→+∞),
Here, Cl(ω),A(−)
l(ω), and A(+)
l(ω) are complex constants. The quasinormal modes of a BH
are defined by the set of frequencies ωnl, such that A(−)
l(ωnl) = 0. This condition ensures that
the modes are related to a purely outgoing wave at spatial infinity and a purely ingoing wave
10at the event horizon. The integers nandlare known as the overtone and multipole numbers,
respectively. The spectrum of quasinormal modes is determined by the eigenvalues of Eq.
(14). To analyze these modes, we employ the WKB method, which is a semi-analytical
approach that takes advantage of the analogy with quantum mechanics.
The WKB approximation was first used by Schutz and Will to compute quasinormal
modes in the study of scattering particles around BHs [122]. Subsequently, Konoplya further
developed this technique [114, 123]. However, for this method to be valid, the potential must
have a barrier-like shape that approaches constant values as r∗→ ±∞ . The quasinormal
modes can then be obtained by fitting the power series of the solution near the maximum
of the potential at its turning points [12].
The formula for the quasinormal modes, as developed by Konoplya, is expressed as:
i(ω2
n−V0)p
−2V′′
0−6X
j=2Λj=n+1
2, (15)
where V′′
0denotes the second derivative of the potential at its maximum r0, and Λ jrepresents
constants that rely on the effective potential and its derivatives at the maximum. It is worth
noting that the WKB approximation has been extended up to the 13th order, as recently
proposed by Matyjasek and Opala [124].
B. Quasinormal modes via P¨ osch–Teller fitting method
In the P¨ oschl–Teller fitting method, the effective potential is approximated with the
P¨ oschl–Teller function [116], which provides an analytical solution for Eq. (13). The effective
potential is substituted with the P¨ oschl–Teller function in the form:
Veff∼VPT=V0
cosh2α(r∗−r∗
0)(16)
where V0andαdenote the height and curvature of the potential at its maximum, respectively.
However, these values are obtained through a fitting method, as outlined in Ref. [125], and
we follow the same approach. By substituting the effective potential with the P¨ oschl–Teller
function, the QNMs are evaluated using the following formula:
ωn=iα
n+1
2
±αr
V0
α2−1
4. (17)
11We applied this equation to calculate the QNMs for different multipoles and NC param-
eter values, in order to investigate the effects of NC space. Overall, the P¨ oschl-Teller fitting
method approximates the effective potential with a function that can be analytically solved,
allowing us to calculate the QNMs using a simple formula.
The calculated QNMs with different NC parameter values are presented in Tables II
and III for the P¨ oschl-Teller fitting method and WKB method, respectively. QNMs are
composed of two main components: the real part, which represents the actual frequency of
the oscillation, and the imaginary part, which is linked to the damping timescale and can
be used to investigate the stability of the BH.
In our analysis, we considered three families of multipoles with l= 0,1,2, where
monopoles satisfy ( n < l ) and Θ is varied. The case of Θ = 0 corresponds to the orig-
inal Schwarzschild BH. In both methods, we observed that increasing the NC parameter
results in a decrease in the propagating frequency ( ωln) when comparing the real part of
the frequencies. However, the imaginary part of the frequency decreases as the Θ value
increases, indicating that higher values of the NC parameter lead to greater stability for the
BH.

V. GREYBODY FACTOR AND ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION IN NON–
COMMUTATIVE MODEL
In this section, we will briefly examine the scattering process using the WKB method.
Another significant aspect of field perturbations around a BH spacetime is the absorption
cross-section. The greybody factor, defined as the probability for an outgoing wave to reach
infinity or the probability for an incoming wave to be absorbed by the BH [126–128], is
crucial in determining the tunneling probability of the wave through the effective potential
of the given BH spacetime. As shown in Fig. 2, the effective potential is influenced by the Θ
parameter. Thus, we aim to investigate the impact of non-commutativity on the greybody
factor and absorption cross–section.
Scattering via the WKB method is an important aspect to consider and requires appropri-
ate boundary conditions. In this case, we aim to determine the reflection and transmission

are complex functions of the purely imaginary quantity Υ, while the purely real frequency

The Grey–body factors of the scalar field computed using the sixth order WKB method
are shown in Fig. 3 for various values of the NC parameter, specifically for multipole l= 1
and other values of lwith varying Θ. As the figure illustrates, increasing the value of Θ leads
to an increase in the Grey–body factors, indicating a greater fraction of the scalar field is
penetrating the potential barrier. As the value of Θ increases, the potential barrier for scalar
fields becomes lower, enabling more particles to transmit through the barrier. In contrast,
the effective potential of the scalar field increases as Θ decreases, leading to a reduction in
the Grey–body factor and the detection of a lower fraction of incoming flow of Hawking
radiation by the observer.

In Fig. 4, we can see the partial absorption cross sections plotted against frequency
for both l= 1 and l= 1 to l= 3, with varying values of the NC parameter. The figure
shows that larger values of the NC parameter correspond to higher partial absorption cross
sections. This trend can be explained by the fact that as the height of the effective potential
decreases with increasing values of the NC parameter, the absorption of the scalar field
increases for a given frequency ˜ ω. Fig. 5 further illustrates this behavior by displaying how
the absorption cross section increases with increasing values of Θ. In Fig. 6, we also display
the partial absorption cross section of different values of M.

VI. GEODESICS IN THE NON–COMMUTATIVE MODEL
Geodesics are of paramount importance in physics, as they reveal the curvature of space-
time and the behavior of particles under gravitational influences. Such a study in NC
scenarios has emerged as a promising field of research, as it explores the implications of
quantum effects on the properties of spacetime. Understanding geodesics in NC scenarios
can help us elucidate the behavior of particles and fields at extremely small scales, where
quantum effects become dominant. Moreover, it is crucial to comprehend the geodesic
configuration of NC BHs to interpret and scrutinize astrophysical observations related to
these entities, such as the features of accretion disks and shadows.
16In this direction, we make this section in order to provide such an investigation. The
geodesic equation reads,
d2xµ
ds2+ Γµ
αβdxα
dsdxβ
ds= 0. (23)
Our fundamental aim is to investigate the influence of non-commutativity on the trajectories
of massless and massive particles. This requires solving a set of lengthy partial differential
equations that arise from Eq. (23). In particular, above expression yields four coupled
partial differential equations that must be solved

where, sis an arbitrary parameter, and the prime symbol “ ′” denotes differentiation with
respect to it (i.e., d /ds).
It is evident that the above equations do not have analytical solutions, and therefore a
numerical analysis is necessary to examine the geodesic trajectories of massive particles. In
order to achieve this, we select certain fixed parameters, such as ϕandθ, and solve them.
Fig. 7 depicts the deflection of light for various values of Θ. Notably, the NC parameter
has a significant impact on the path of light, causing a “contraction” to it as Θ increases.
Furthermore, we observe that the event horizon expands as Θ increases. Recent research
has also explored the divergent reflections of BHs resulting from non–commutativity [131].
In contrast, Fig. 8 illustrates the behavior of trajectories for massive particles. As ex-
pected, these particles also experience significant modifications compared to massless parti-
cles. For different values of Θ, we observe a “squeezing” behavior and a larger event horizon,
similar to the massless case. To this case, the “squeezing” effect is more evident in compari-
son with the light case. It is noteworthy that all system configurations are compared to the

calculated within the context of NC scenario, with an estimate of Θµνbased on observational
data [132]. This emphasizes the importance of studying the effects of non–commutativity in
gravitational systems.
A. Critical orbits in the non–commutative model
The critical orbits are essential to comprehend the dynamics of particles and the behavior
of light rays in the vicinity of BHs with NC structures. These orbits offer valuable insights
into the properties of spacetime under quantum effects.
To better understand the consequences of non–commutativity on the photon sphere (crit-
ical orbit) of our BH, we shall use the Lagrangian method to develop the calculations of
null–geodesics. This method provides a more accessible approach for readers to comprehend
the calculations if compared to the geodesic equation. By examining the effects of Θ on the

fact gives rise to: the photon sphere turns out to be larger as the NC parameter Θ increases.
This finding aligns with the outcomes illustrated in our manuscript regarding light deflection
(refer to Fig. 7).
VII. SHADOW RADIUS IN NON–COMMUTATIVE MODEL
To investigate the null geodesics equation in the spacetime of deformed Schwarzschild
spacetime and study the effect of the NC parameter on photon evolution, we begin by
considering the spherically symmetric spacetime metric given by Eq. (9) and apply the
Hamilton–Jacobi action.
∂S
∂τ=−1
2gµν∂S
∂τµ∂S
∂τν(31)
where Sis the Jacobi action and τis the arbitrary affine parameter. The variables can be
separated by
S=1
2m2τ−Et+Lϕ+Sr(r) +Sθ(θ). (32)
We can express Sr(r) and Sθ(θ) as functions of randθ, respectively. Since we are consid-
ering a photon with zero mass, mis zero. The constants of motion, energy Eand angular
momentum L, are conserved quantities along the photon’s path. By using Eqs. (31) and
(32), we can obtain the null geodesic equations as follows:
dt
dτ=E
fΘ(r), (33)
dr
dτ=p
R(r)
r2, (34)
dθ
dτ=±p
Q(r)
r2, (35)
dφ
dτ=Lcsc2θ

20where R(r) andQ(θ) are defined as
R(r) =E2r4−(K+L2)r2fΘ(r) (37)
Q(θ) =K −L2cot2θ, (38)
andKis the Carter constant [133]. The plus and minus sign in Eq. (35) indicate a motion
of the photon in the outgoing and ingoing radial direction. In this work, we set the angle
θ=π/2 and consider only the equatorial plane without loss of generality. Now, we focus on
the radial equation by introducing the effective potential
dr
dτ2
+Veff(r) = 0 . (39)
Here, the effective potential is defined
Veff(r) = (L2+K)fΘ(r)
r2−E2(40)
and we introduce two impact parameter
ξ=L
Eandη=K
E2. (41)
The critical radius of a photon can be calculated by applying the unstable condition on
effective potential as
Veff=dVeff
dr= 0, (42)
which leads
2−rf′
Θ(r)
fΘ(r)|r=rc= 0. (43)
Also, by using both Eq. (40) and Eq. (41) in above expression, we obtain
ξ2+η=r2
c
fΘ(rc). (44)
Let us now calculate the shadow radius using celestial coordinates αandβ[134], which
are related to the constants of motion as α=−ξandβ=±√η. The shadow radius can be
expressed as
Rsh=p
α2+β2=rcp
fΘ(rc), (45)
where rcis the radius of the photon sphere obtained in Eq. (43). In this manner, the
equation for the shadow radius in the NC spacetime reads

masses: M= 0.15,0.25,0.35,0.45,0.55.
In Fig. 9, we present an analysis of the shadow boundaries of a NC BH for a range of
Θ values on the left–hand side. Notably, the shadow radius exhibits an increase as the Θ
parameter rises. On the right-hand side, we explore the impact of the BH’s mass on the
same NC parameter. As evidenced by the figure, the shadow radius undergoes an increase
when the original mass Mtransitions from 0 .75 to 1 .5. As the remnant mass at the fixed
condition of NC parameter of Θ2= 0.4 isMrem∼0.137, the mass is considered to be
changed beyond the remnant boundary.
It is pertinent to note that the deformed NC mass MΘdefined in Eq. (3) attains a
minimum value. The shadow radius will exhibit a decrease until it attains this minimum
value when the original mass of the BH is reduced. As we surpass this point, an increase in
the original mass of the BH leads to a rise in the deformed mass MΘ, subsequently resulting
in an increase in the shadow radius.
To enhance the visual representation, following the approach in [135], we present a plot in
Fig. 11 illustrating the relationship between the shadow radius Rsand the mass M, while
keeping Θ fixed. Notably, the inclusion of the NC effect introduces a minimum remnant
mass M, which subsequently leads to a minimum shadow radius. It is important to note
22that the dashed area depicted in Fig. 9 is considered unphysical due to these NC effects.
According to the EHT horizonscale of SgrA∗, the Keck and VLTI mass–to–distance ration
priors for SgrA∗are averaged and considering two standard deviation two constraints have
been obtained for shadow radius. [136, 137].

We have examined the proper constraint for NC parameter upon the experimental con-
straints. The shadow radius in units of mass ( M) is plotted with respect to the NC param-
eters in units of Min Fig.10. The blue and green area are consistent to the experimental
limits in Eqs. (47,48). The plot cuts the experimental constraint lines in two points which
make an upper limit on NC parameter. Therefore, we have Θ <0.312 and Θ <1.222, based
on first and second experimental data, respectively.

VIII. DEFLECTION ANGLE IN NON–COMMUTATIVE MODEL
The deflection of light as it propagates through curved spacetime represents a pivotal and
captivating phenomenon, serving as an indispensable tool in the realm of scientific inquiry.
By elegantly conforming to the contours of spacetime, light unveils a mesmerizing interplay
that bestows invaluable insights into the intricate physics underlying gravitational sources
[138–143]. Through meticulous observation and rigorous analysis, this phenomenon not
only unlocks profound discoveries but also engenders a deeper comprehension of the cosmos,
fostering the expansion of our knowledge and illuminating the fundamental workings of the
universe.
Thereby, to quantify this deflection angle, a well–established formula [135, 144] is em-
ployed
ˆα(rmin) = 2ˆ∞
rmindr

(r
rmin)2fΘ(rmin)−fΘ(r)−π (49)
where rminis the distance of closest approach of light ray to the BH which is linked to the
impact parameter as
ξ=rminq
1−2M
rmin. (50)
In order to assess the influence of the NC parameter on the deflection angle, we proceed by
substituting the metric derived from Equation (9) into Equation (49). The obtained results
are summarized in Table V, elucidating the deflection angle for a NC Schwarzschild BH with
24a constant impact parameter and variable values of Θ. Moreover, to further investigate this
relationship, Table VI presents the corresponding deflection angles for distinct values of Θ,
while maintaining the mass fixed at M= 1.
Furthermore, it is noteworthy to observe that the deflection angle exhibits a direct cor-
relation with both the mass and the parameter Θ. Specifically, as the values of mass and
Θ increase, there is a corresponding increase in the magnitude of the deflection angle. This
finding underscores the influence of these factors on the bending of light in the presence of
a NC Schwarzschild BH, emphasizing the significant role played by mass and parameter Θ.

IX. CONCLUSION
Our study aimed to comprehensively explore various fundamental aspects of a non–
commutative (NC) theory, with a specific emphasis on the implications of mass deformation.
In pursuit of this objective, we conducted a thorough investigation into the system’s ther-
modynamic properties, comparing our findings with the latest research documented in the
literature [78]. Additionally, we delved into the analysis of quasinormal modes associated
with massless scalar perturbations, employing two distinct methodologies: the WKB ap-
proximation and the P¨ oschl–Teller fitting technique.
Our examination of the Klein–Gordon equation allowed us to determine the effective
potential, which we successfully matched with the P¨ oschl–Teller potential, serving as our
25chosen effective potential. This approach enabled us to analytically compute the quasinor-
mal modes. Notably, our analysis unveiled a noteworthy characteristic: the real part of
the quasinormal modes remained independent of the quantum number ncontrasting with
numerical results suggesting an n–dependent behavior. Remarkably, our adoption of the
P¨ oschl–Teller potential aligned with numerical findings, demonstrating this n–dependent
aspect.
Furthermore, we observed that increasing the NC parameter led to a decrease in both
the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes, indicating reduced stability and
decay rates with higher NC values. Additionally, the NC parameter increment resulted in
an overall rise in the total absorption cross–section across all ωvalues.
Our investigation extended to the analysis of geodesics for both massless and massive
particles, with a specific focus on the influence exerted by the NC parameter Θ. Our findings
emphasized the substantial impact of Θ on the trajectories of light and event horizons.
Specifically, we noted that an increasing NC parameter corresponded to heightened light
absorption by the black hole, resulting in an expansion of the photonic radius and the size
of the shadow.
Additionally, we harnessed observational data from the EHT related to the Schwarzschild
NC black hole shadow of SgrA∗to establish upper limits on the NC parameter. Our anal-
ysis, incorporating EHT constraints on SgrA∗’s shadow, compellingly demonstrated that a
significant portion of the non–rotating NC black hole parameter space aligned with EHT
observations. Our emphasis remained on the non–rotating scenario, as the rotation parame-
ter for SgrA∗is sufficiently small to induce negligible deviations in the shadow radius [136].
pauloFinally, our exploration extended to the analysis of the deflection angle within this
context.
