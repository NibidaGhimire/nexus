We introduce a new class of thin exible structures that morph from a at shape into prescribed
3D shapes without an external stimulus such as mechanical loads or heat. To achieve control over
the target shape, two dierent concepts are coupled. First, motivated by biological growth, strain
mismatch is applied between the at composite layers to transform it into a 3D shape. Depending
on the amount of the applied strain mismatch, the transformation involves buckling into one of
the available nite number of mode shapes. Second, inspired by kirigami, portions of the material
are removed from one of the layers according to a specic pattern. This dramatically increases the
number of possible 3D shapes and allows us to attain specic topologies. We devise an experimental
apparatus that allows precise control of the strain mismatch. An inverse problem is posed, where
starting from a given target shape, the physical parameters that make these shapes possible are
determined. To show how the concept works, we focus on circular composite plates and design a
kirigami pattern that yields a hemispherical structure. Our analysis combines a theoretical approach
with numerical simulations and physical experiments to understand and predict the transition from

Figure 1. Overview of the problem. (A) Of two circular layers, the bottom layer is stretched and
adhered to the unstretched top layer to obtain a soft composite. Upon releasing the constraints,
the strain mismatch between the two layers induces symmetry breaking and the composite may
assume a buckled shape with a nite number (3 in this case) of waves along the circumference. (B)
Replacing the top circular layer with a kirigami layer (layer with cuts) can lead to a preprogrammed
shape via the same procedure. The shape is governed by the kirigami pattern. In this case, the
goal was to obtain an axisymmetrical cap.
22D to 3D shapes. The tools developed here can be extended to attain arbitrary 3D shapes. The
initially at shape suggests that conventional additive manufacturing techniques can be used to
functionalize the soft kirigami composites to fabricate, for example, deployable 3D shapes, smart
skins, and soft electromagnetic metasurfaces.
Morphing planar structures into preprogrammed three-dimensional shapes has applications
in engineering across a wide range of length-scales from microns [ 1] to meters [ 2]. Since
conventional additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques typically support planar
fabrication, morphing from 2D to 3D is a promising way to achieve 3D functional surfaces
for use in, e.g., curvy electronics for wearables [ 3], camouaging [ 4], structural health
monitoring [ 5], multi-functional soft machines [ 6], with existing manufacturing tools. Since
the introduction of bimetallic strips [ 7] in the 18th century, morphing of slender structures
into desired shapes has been actuated via heat [ 8,9], light [ 10], electromagnetism [ 11],
chemical gradient [ 12], growth [ 13], and various forms of external stimuli. Another approach
to morphing is inspired by origami, which has been particularly successful in deployable
aerospace structures [ 14] that require small storage space but a large surface area. Such
deployables are typically piecewise rigid and may require multiple springs, support structures,
or other mechanisms for deployment. In this paper, a new class of deployables are envisioned
that spontaneously morph from a planar shape to a prescribed 3D shape and are fully exible
without any rigid parts.
Towards fully exible shells that morph from a 2D shape to a prescribed 3D topology,
previous works on imposing mechanical loads and boundary conditions on sheets provide
a solid foundation. Simply pulling a thin elastic sheet can induce 3D deformation through
wrinkling instabilities [ 15]. Grason et al. showed that imposing curvature to elastic sheets
leads to distinct types of structural instabilities [ 16]. We consider this as an incompatibility
of topologies leading to complex shapes. A simple instantiation of this concept can be
achieved by draping a at cloth around a spherical object. If the radius of the sphere is
much larger than the size of the cloth, the planar cloth may assume the imposed 3D shape.
However, if the sizes of the cloth and the sphere are comparable, wrinkles and crumples
form. Geometric frustration leading to mechanical instabilities in sheets manifests itself in
geometrically incompatible connement of solids. Davidovitch et al. [ 17] studied a class of
such problems in which the topography imposed on a thin solid body is incompatible with
3its intrinsic metric and wrinkles emerged as a consequence. These earlier works on the type
and size of patterns during 2D to 3D transition inspired our solution to obtain 3D shapes
with a prescribed target metric. Specically, to avoid wrinkles (which depend on geometry
and material stiness) on the 3D shape, we explore the removal of the material to relieve
geometric frustration and study its dependence on geometric and material properties.
New possibilities for shape selection open up when strain mismatch is introduced within
a at structure [ 18{22]. Pezzulla et al. [ 21] studied geometric frustration between multiple
parts of the body that leads to 3D deformation of the naturally planar object. Strain
mismatch introduced into any part of a thin body by, e.g., heating, growth, or swelling, can
drastically aect the morphology of the entire object and induce mechanical instabilities.
Such morphological changes are preponderant in biological structures and are often necessary
for their functionality; examples include Venus ytrap, growing leaves, and the writhing
of tendril bearing climbers in plants and formation of brains, lungs, and guts in animals.
Combining geometric connement with strain mismatch can open pathways to an even
broader class of shapes. Stein et al. [ 23] used residual swelling and geometric connement to
generate a range of shapes including saddles, rolled sheets, cylinders, and spherical sections.
Our work synergistically combines emergence of mechanical instabilities and strain mismatch
to fabricate composite shells that morph from a at shape to a prescribed 3D shape.
In this paper, we emphasize having control over the nal 3D shape that morphs from an
initially planar shape in contrast with prior works that had access to only a nite number
of shapes. Our work uses a hemispherical smooth shape as a representative 3D shape. An
intuitive (but ultimately incorrect) approach is presented in Fig. 1A, where a \bottom" layer
is radially stretched and attached to a \top" unstretched layer to form a soft composite
shell. The shape of this composite is 3D but not hemispherical. A number of distinct
shapes can emerge in this system, which are analyzed by F oppl-Von K arm an plate theory,
numerical simulations using the nite element method, and physical experiments. This
lays the foundation for a solution to the hemispherical problem. Kirigami (i.e., removal of
material) to relieve geometric frustration is introduced; a combination of kirigami and strain
mismatch is proposed to access arbitrary 3D shapes. The interplay between the kirigami
pattern, strain mismatch and the nal shape is explored through experiments, simulations,
and theoretical analysis. Fig. 1B shows an example where a hemispherical shape is achieved
by tuning the kirigami pattern and the strain mismatch. The concept of combining kirigami
4and strain mismatch can now be generalized to achieve arbitrary 3D shapes beyond just the
hemispherical ones. A new experimental apparatus is designed and fabricated to impose
uniform biaxial stretch onto the bottom layer while avoiding wrinkling due to Poisson's
eect [24].
Our paper is organized as follows. We commence with a description of the experimental
apparatus in Physical Experiments . Various shapes resulting from two circular layers with
strain mismatch is described in Soft Circular Composites . Kirigami on this composite
introduced in Soft Kirigami Composites and methods to achieve the target hemispherical
shape are discussed.
PHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS
The photograph of our custom designed experimental apparatus is presented in Fig. 2A1-
A2. Two main components { a 3D-printed cylinder assembly and two vertically positioned
linear translation stages { make up the set. The hyperelastic materials of the bottom layer
(VHB 4910, 3M) and the top layer (VHB 4950, 3M) have double-side stickiness. Material
properties are listed in Materials and Methods . As shown in Fig. 2A2, the bottom layer
is placed on top of the cylindrical casing. The contacting part is pressed by a 3d-printed
gripper in in Fig. 2B1-B2. The assembly is then placed between two vertical linear translation
stages and the stages are moved to a specic height corresponding to a speicic prestretch.
As the stages are moved upward, the piston { pushed by the height adjuster { also moves up
but the outer edge of the bottom layer remains gripped onto the cylindrical casing. This
leads to a uniform biaxial stretch in the hyperelastic material. The relation between the
imposed stretch and height can be determined from simple geometry. The top layer is glued
onto the stretched bottom layer to form a bilayer composite. The bilayer composite is then
cut out from the apparatus and released from the gripper. This resulting 3D structure is
referred to as the \soft kirigami composite" in this paper.
SOFT CIRCULAR COMPOSITES
Our investigation starts with the setup described in Fig. 1. A bottom layer of circular
shape is rst stretched by a prescribed amount of prestretch ( = 1 corresponds to stress-free

parameters are described in Materials and Methods. Once the composite structure is
released from the experimental setup of Fig. 2, a variety of shapes emerge depending on
prestretch,. In Fig. 3A, a series of four shapes of the experimental composites are presented.
These shapes { that only dier by { are qualitatively dierent. The number of wrinkles
6on the outer edge of the composites, represented by the knumber in the gure, increases
fromk= 0 in Fig. 3A1 to k= 4 in Fig. 3A4. Fig. 3B shows nite element (FE) simulations
that can also capture the qualitatively distinct shapes. While developing FE simulations, we
realized the existence of dierent branches in the solution space and a propensity for the FE
method to reach a local energy minimum instead of the global. This exposes a challenge in
numerical simulation of such structures and motivates us to fundamentally understand the
problem through a theoretical lens. The next section outlines the theory that was developed
to explain the observations in Fig. 3.

tensor under F oppl-von Karman (FvK) kinematic assumptions, which further simplies the

10Uncut symmetric solution
Following experimental results shown in Fig. 3 we rst seek an axi-symmetric solution,
which we refer to as a \cup". The theory suggests that after the prestretched layer is adhered
to a nonprestretched one the membrane stresses are equlibrated in both layers after the
release, but due to the coupling between membrane stresses in the mid-surface of each layer,
bending moments are induced. These lead to the shortening and compressive (circular)
membrane forces in the circumference of the two-layered circular composite plate, most
prominently towards the edge. By plane equilibrium, tensile membrane forces are induced
towards the center of the circular plate.
Due to the symmetry of the problem, the order of both PDEs (6) and (7) that describe
the deformation of the composite plate can be reduced by substitution '=w;rand=F;r.

From experiments and simulations described earlier we learn that by increasing the
prestrecth, the axisymmetric cup structure losses its stability and wrinkles into a k-fold
axisymmetric structure when the circular forces exceed some critical.
11k-fold axisymmetric postbuckling
We seek the k-fold axisymmetric solution with the following two model functions w(r;) =

symmetric solutions, when the prestretch is increased. Fig. 4, where the occuring deformation
modes and their strain energies are displayed. With each following mode the wrinkles are
more and more localized at the edge, because with deeper and deeper spherical cap, the
membrane compressive stresses are more and more localized at the edge (see Fig. ??) and
then released through wrinkling. Because wrinkles with large k-fold symmetry are more
localized at the edge, they are energetically more favorable, because they release more of the
membrane energy, which is localized at the edge.
Another reason why the higher deformation modes kare promoted with larger prestretches
is that the increasing curvature of the system (spherical cup) provides geometric rigidity,
which acts analogously to an elastic substrate. This is evident if we linearize (11) 2and insert
it into (11) 1. We obtain an equation of the form ~D2~w N0:r
r ~w+0(0:0)~w= 0,
which is analogous to the equation that governs wrinkling of thin compressed lms on
compliant substrates. The therm 0(0:0)~wpenalizes buckling modes with large amplitude
to wavelength ratios, therefore buckling modes with larger kare energetically preferable.
Deep postbuckling
When the stretching of the membrane is large we observe that k-fold symmetric solution
is no longer energetically favorable. Instead, we detect experimentally and computationally
12(using Abaqus) that cylindrical bending solution is dominant. We refer to this solution as
a \scroll" solution. This reduces Eq. (6)to11;11= 0, as only 116= 0 and22=12= 0,
while Eq. (7)is automatically satised. Assuming stress free edges, we obtain N=0and
11=0=D. The strain energy is calculated as E=a22
0=(2D).
Thek-fold symmetries do not increase indenitely. At a certain point the scroll solution
(which is similar to the 2-fold symmetry) oers the largest relaxation of the membrane
stresses. Its membrane stresses are released entirely, however the price for this is a bit larger
bending strain energy, than in the k-fold symmetric cases, therefore it is not preferable with
smaller.
SOFT KIRIGAMI COMPOSITES
Informed by the nonlinear nature of the problem and the existence of multiple branches
in the previous section, we essentially need to nd out a way of reaching the hemispherical
cap solution. Therefore, we need to achieve at least \quasi-axisymmetric", if not an axi-
symmetric ( k= 0) solution at at larger values of prestretch. A opposed to the 1D example,
where applying enough prestretch enables us to produce a circle, here on the circular plate
circular compressive forces [ 23,25,26] occuring due to the change of circumference during
bending, prevent that the circular plate would bend into a hemisphere, as the k-fold wrinkling
inastability or scroll instability occurs at the edge [25{27].
The rst solution that comes to mind [ 28{30] is therefore to cut the top layer along a
prescribed path, whereby forming a so called \soft kirigami composite" as a way of releasing
the compressive force from certain areas of the composite and partially remove the wrinkled
nature of the outer edge. A heuristic shape for the top layer was chosen as shown in Fig. 1B.
Physical parameters are presented in Materials and Methods . Fig. 5A and B present
snapshots of the structural shapes at dierent values of prestretch from experiments and
simulations, respectively.
If we remove a circumferential fraction of material , which is divided between ncpieces,
we enforce nc-fold symmetry, which is unfortunatelly only \quasi-axisymmetric" and not
axi-symmetric k= 0. This is because, even at small prestretches , but even more so

parameters: C1= 4:00 kPa,C2= 78:7152 kPa, and D1= 4:1082103kPa.
15In order to normalize the elastic strain energy, we formulate a characteristic elastic energy
of the composites: E=Yh3, whereY= 2G(1 +) is the eective Young's modulus of
the substrate, his the thickness of the substrate, and =3K 2G
6K+2G,G= 2(C1+C2), and
K= 2=D1:
For the soft kirigami composites in Fig. 5, the number of cuts is nc= 10 and the ratio of
the inner radius to the outer radius is  r= 0:4 andd= 0:1 radians, i.e., 1 out of 2 radian
was removed. This corresponds to = 0:13.
