Abstract
We address the fundamental diﬀerence between solid-solid an d liquid-liquid phase
transitions within the Ericksen’s nonlinear elasticity pa radigm. To highlight ideas, we
consider the simplest nontrivial 2D problem and work with a p rototypical two-phase
Hadamard material which allows one to weaken the rigidity an d explore the nature
of solid-solid phase transitions in a “near-liquid” limit. In the language of calculus of
variations we probe limits of quasiconvexity in an “almost l iquid” solid by comparing
the thresholds for cooperative (laminate based) and non-co operative (inclusion based)
nucleation. Using these two types of nucleation tests we obt ain for our model material
surprisingly tight two-sided bounds on the elastic binodal without directly computing
the quasiconvex envelope.
1 Introduction
In 1975 J. Ericksen placed for the ﬁrst time the problem of solid-solid phase transitions
in the framework of nonlinear elasticity theory. He eﬀectively refor mulated the classical
physics problem as a problem of vectorial calculus of variations. The contemporaneous
physical theory viewed non-hydrostatically stressed solids as met astable and therefore did
notdistinguish betweensolid-solidandliquid-liquidphasetransitions. E ricksen’s insightthat
during phase transitions the non-hydrostatic stresses may pers ist at time scales of interest,
revolutionized elasticity theory and initiated the extremely success ful research program of
studying materials with non-quasiconvex energies [44, 13, 37, 6, 10 ]. The goal of the present
paper is to elucidate the diﬀerence between solid-solid and liquid-liquid p hase transitions
within the Ericksen’s nonlinear elasticity paradigm.
From the perspective of elasticity theory, the main diﬀerence betw een liquids and solids
is that liquids do not resist shear [8, 14]. This degeneracy in the elastic constitutive structure
of liquids is responsible for their peculiar behavior during ﬁrst order p hase transitions vis a
vis the behavior of solids, characterized by ﬁnite rigidity [21]. For bo th solids and liquids,

1reaching phase equilibrium often means the formation of phase mixtu res. However, while
the phase organization in liquid phase transitions is largely controlled b y surface tension,
in solid phase transitions the dominance of elastic long-range interac tions leaves to surface
tension only a minor role of a scale selection. The dependence of ener gy on the geometric
arrangement of the phases in solids leads to speciﬁc morphologies, la rgely controlled by the
interplay between the location of the energy wells and their kinematic compatibility [5].
First order phase transitions in liquids are well understood at both p hysical and mathe-
matical levels [39, 13]. The reason is that the scalar problem confron ted in the liquid case is
fully solvable [11]. Instead, despite many dedicated eﬀorts, largely in spired by the pioneer-
ing contributions of Ericksen himself [16, 15, 17, 18, 19], the mathem atical understanding of
elastic phase transitions in solids is still far from being complete. In pa rticular, some basic
underlying vectorial problems of the calculus of variations remain un solved [6, 3].
To set thestage, we recall that innonlinear elasticity theenergy fu nctional canbewritten
in the form E[y] =/integraltext
ΩW(∇y)dx,whereW(F) is the energy density function describing the
elastic properties of the material. For the energy minimizing conﬁgur ations the physically
informed energy density W(F) is replaced by its quasiconvexiﬁcation QW(F) [12]. The
lattercanbegivenbyanimplicitformulawhichbecomesexplicit onlyifone knowstheenergy
minimizing microstructures. In the case of liquids the geometry of su ch microstructures is
irrelevant and the construction of QW(F) reduces to convexiﬁcation. In the case of solids,
the task of ﬁnding the equilibrium microstructures in a generic settin g is daunting.
With the aim of building a bridge between elastic phase transitions in liquid s and solids,
we consider in this paper a special limit of “near-liquid” solids which are c haracterized by an
arbitrarily weak resistance to shear. We pose the general questio n of how in such a limit the
tight control on the geometry of optimal microstructures by elas tic interactions is lost. To
answer this question we address a simpler problem of describing in this limit the boundary
of the set of stable single-phase conﬁgurations. Such problem can be solved in the case of
“strongly-solid” elastic phase transitions when the equilibrium micros tructures are simple
laminates [27]. The goal of the present paper is to understand the o pposite, “weakly-solid”
limit, when the simplest laminate-based microstructures are clearly s uboptimal.
In physics literature the boundary of the set of stable single-phas e conﬁgurations is delin-
eated by the classical Maxwell-Gibbs equilibrium conditions which were o riginally developed
to describe phase equilibrium in liquids [41, 20]. These conditions allow on e to identify the
homogeneous conﬁgurations that are unstable to perturbations that are small in extent but
not necessarily in magnitude. Such conﬁgurations are known in phys ics as constituting the
binodal region [45]. In the mathematical theory of elastic phase tra nsitions, the “solid” ana-
log of the binodal region would incorporate the homogeneous state s that fail to be strong
local minima of the energy functional.
In thisperspective, the binodal regionis asubset inthe conﬁgurat ionspace of strainmea-
sures where the quasiconvex envelope lies below the energy density . Locating the boundary
of the binodal region (called the binodalin physics) in the general setting constitutes a major
challenge. While remaining nontrivial, this task appears, at least a prio ri, as more tractable
than the task of constructing the actual quasiconvex envelope. In the present paper we
address the problem of the binodal in the “near-liquid” limit and show t hat in such a limit
the explicit knowledge of the binodal can lead directly to explicit formu las for at least some

parts of the quasiconvex envelope.
Inourpriorworkwehavedevelopedgeneralmethodsforidentifyin g subsetsofthebinodal
marking the emergence (nucleation) of coherent regions of a new p hase [24]. The main tool
in such analysis is the characterization of the jump set [23]—a codime nsion one variety in the
phase space corresponding to nucleation of coherent laminae. The knowledge of the jump set
provides a general way to constrain (bound) the binodal from with in, without any guarantee
that the bound is optimal. Applying our methods of identifying both st able and unstable
parts of the jump set ultimately leads to a realistic approximation of t he whole binodal in
the “near-liquid” limit.
Tohighlightideas, wefocusinthispaperonthesimplestfamilyofnon-q uasiconvexenergy
densities describing Hadamard materials [31, 32]: W(F) =µ
2|F|2+h(detF).Speciﬁcally,
we are interested in the case of two space dimensions1and assume that the function h(d)
describes a generic double-well potential modeling isotropic-to-iso tropic phase transitions
(see Fig. 1). The main advantage of this class of energy densities is t hat it contains a single
parameter µwhich can be viewed as a scale of the eﬀective rigidity. By varying this s cale
one can study the entire range of intermediate rigidity responses f rom “strong” ( µ≫1) to
“weak” ( µ≪1) and in this way expose the crossover from “solid” to “liquid” behav ior.
An interesting property of Hadamard materials is the subtle asymmetry between the two
isotropic phases. It is intriguing, as it can be attributed neither to t he diﬀerence between
the elastic moduli of the phases nor to the geometric nonlinearity of the model. Indeed,
it persists even if the two wells of the nonlinear potential h(d) are identical in the sense
that they have the same height and the same tangential elastic mod uli. The only diﬀerence
between the two phases is then governed by the small term µ|F|2/2, that is larger at the
low density phase and smaller at the high density phase. However, du e to this diﬀerence,
and in contrast to the case of an ostensibly similar geometrically linear ly model [35, 43, 36],
the two phases of an Hadamard material admit rather dissimilar ecos ystems of instability
mechanisms. Thus, rather remarkably, the instability of the low ene rgy phase proceeds
by nucleation of a compact region of the high energy minority phase, in contrast to the
formation of laminar microstructure, when the high energy phase lo ses its stability. We
show that such an asymmetry leads to a coexistence of “strongly- solid” and “weakly-solid”
1In principle, our methodology is also applicable in 3D. In this paper we ha ve chosen a 2D setting to
make the ideas and techniques fully transparent and to be able to illus trate them graphically.

(or even “quasi-liquid”) responses inside a single material model. In p articular, even in the
absence of hysteresis, the direct and reverse phase transitions in such material can proceed
according to morphologically distinct transformation mechanisms.
To understand this behavior, we ﬁrst recall that while for an Hadam ard material the
double well energy structure is described in terms of a single scalar p otentialh(d), the results
of relaxation of W(F) are nontrivial due to the inherent incompatibility of the energy wells
associated with the purely volumetric nature of the implied phase tra nsition. In the case of
only one well, when the possibility of phase transition is absent, the re sult of such relaxation
is trivial as it is known that W(F) is quasiconvex if and only if h(d) is convex [4]. The
relaxation of W(F) with two wells and non-convex h(d) is known for the “inﬁnitely-weak”
solids (eﬀectively liquids) with µ= 0, where QW(F) =h∗∗(detF) [11] and in the “strongly-
solid”limitwhentheshearmodulus µissuﬃcientlylarge[27]. Inthelattercasethequadratic
term in the energy dominates the double-well term and the formula f orQW(F) couples |F|
and detFplacing the relaxed energy between W(F) above and U(F) =µ
2|F|2+h∗∗(detF)
below.
In the present paper we show that the lower bound on the rigidity me asureµin [27] was
not a technical limitation, and that, as µdecreases, the above “strongly-solid” expression for
QW(F)ceasestobevalidinthesubsets ofthebinodalcorresponding toh ydrostaticDirichlet
boundary conditions. More speciﬁcally, we show that in the limit of sma llµ, the relaxation
ofW(F) goes through a chain of structural transitions with simple laminatio n persisting
either only for high shear hard device loading and in the vicinity of the h igher energy well.
Close to the low energy well it is replaced by more complex optimal micro structures which
remainnotfullycharacterized. Fig.2showstheschematicenergyla ndscapeoftheHadamard

ε1andε2are the singular values of the deformation gradient F; in both panels the black
dot represents the applied aﬃne hydrostatic Dirichlet boundary co nditions. The left panel
4shows the ﬁelds and their rank-one connections at the onset of th e instability of the high
energy phase. The compatible ﬁeld (inside a simple laminate) takes two values represented
by the red dot on the left and one of the two red dots on the right. T he right panel
shows the ﬁelds at the onset of the instability in the low energy phase . The corresponding
compatible ﬁeld takes values in the set represented by the red dot o n the left and the red
segment on the right. Here the system takes advantage of a shallo w valley ( µis small) which
provides an opportunity to accommodate the loading through low en ergy elastic deformation
(remotely reminiscent of a ﬂuid ﬂow). Note, however, that the eme rgence of diﬀerent types
of instability mechanisms along direct and return deformation paths cannot be attributed
solely to geometric nonlinearity of the Hadamard model, as a somewha t similar asymmetry
is also present in the geometrically linear model whenever the two pha ses have diﬀerent well
ordered elastic moduli: in that case the material with larger elastic mo duli plays the role of
the high energy phase [1, 22, 9, 2].
In this paper our main technical approach is to generate bounds on the binodal surface.
The simplest bounds are obtained as a result of probing the binodal b y means of nucleating
ﬁrst rank laminates. Their optimality is proved by establishing their po lyconvexity (and
therefore quasiconvexity); the corresponding problem is algebra ic because the supporting
null-Lagrangians can be constructed explicitly [28]. In contrast wit h the “strongly solid”
regime of large µ, in the “near-liquid” regime of small µ, not all of the ﬁrst rank laminate
bounds turn out to be optimal.
The simple laminate bounds are ﬁrst improved by considering the nucle ation of second
rank laminates even though, as will be shown in [29], the second rank la minate bounds
are also not optimal. We could improve them analytically for hydrostat ic strains only by
considering nucleation of a bounded circular inclusion in the inﬁnite plan e. Moreover, we
provided a rationale behind the conjecture that the “circular inclus ion bound” is in fact
optimal. We show that if this conjecture could be proved, the the va lues of the deformation
gradient in the exterior of the circular nucleus would provide a bound on the whole binodal
from the outside of the binodal region. Another consequence of t he conjectured optimality
of the inclusion-based nucleation bound would be the explicit formula f or the quasiconvex
envelope QW(F) at all hydrostatic strains. To corroborateour conjecture we j uxtaposed the
results obtained for bounded inclusions and unbounded second ran k laminates and derived
tight two-sided bounds on the binodal. As will be reported elsewhere , numerical computa-
tions show that both bounds remain tight in the full range of parame ters for which they are
meaningful, with the hypothetical bound being in perfect agreemen t with the numerically
computed rank-one convex binodal.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recapitulate the ge neral results from
the calculus of variations for nonconvex vectorial problems which a re later used in the paper.
In Section 3 we specialize these results for the Hadamard material a nd present the numerical
illustrations of the obtained bounds. Analytical results for the limitin g caseµ→0 are pre-
sented in Section 4 where we also compare them with numerical compu tations. In Section 5
we demonstrate the far reaching consequences of the assumed o ptimality of the nucleation
bound. The paper ends with a general discussion and conclusions in S ection 6.
52 Preliminaries
Binodal region. We recall that hyperelastic materials in an n-dimensional space are charac-
terized by the following form of the energy stored in the deformed e lastic body
E[y] =/integraldisplay
ΩW(∇y(x))dx.
Here Ω⊂Rnis the reference conﬁguration, and y: Ω→Rnis the deformation. To deal
with stable (i.e. experimentally observable) conﬁgurations of the bo dy one can replace the
energy density W(F) with a relaxed one QW(F), known as a quasiconvexiﬁcation of W(F).
Even though, there is a formula for QW(F) [12]:
QW(F) = inf
φ∈C∞
0(B;Rn)1
|D|/integraldisplay
BW(F+∇φ)dx, (2.1)
whereBis the unit ball, there are no systematic approaches to actually comp ute it. A
simpler, but just as useful an object, is the elastic binodal.
Deﬁnition 2.1. An elastic binodal is the boundary of the binodal region
B={F:QW(F)< W(F)}. (2.2)
Deﬁnition 2.2. We say that the matrix Fis stable, if W(F) =QW(F).
Thus, the binodal is the boundary separating the binodal region fr om the set of stable
points.
Jump set. While there could be rank-one convex, non quasiconvex functions, most cases
of practical interest in elastic phase transitions feature multiwell e nergies that are not rank-
one convex. Such functions possess a non-trivial jump set, stable points of which form a part
of the binodal (or the entire binodal, if one is lucky). The jump set is t he set of solutions
F=F−of the equations [23]

whereWFindicates the matrix of partial derivatives Pij=∂W/∂F ij. The vectors aandn
can be eliminated from (2.3), leaving a single scalar equation for Fthat describes the jump
set. The points on the jump set belong either to the binodal or to th e binodal region B, see
6[23] for details. Hence, the jump set always represents a bound on the binodal region from
within.
One of the easy ways to detect the unstable parts of the jump set is to use the Weierstrass
condition, which is necessary for stability.
W◦(F,b⊗m)≥0,∀b∈Rn,|m|= 1, (2.4)
where
W◦(F,H) =W(F+H)−W(F)−/a\}b∇acketle{tWF(F),H/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht.
We have proved in [25] that the pairs of points F±on the jump set are either both stable
or both unstable. Hence, a point F+satisfying (2.4) can be still classiﬁed as unstable, if F−
fails (2.4). While there are other conditions of stability that don’t follo w from (2.4) (see [26])
we will only make use of an easily veriﬁable corollary of (2.4) that restr icts the rank-one test
ﬁeldsb⊗mto an inﬁnitesimally small neighborhood of [[ F]] =a⊗n(see [23, (4.5)]).
Currently, the only general tool for establishing stability of an aﬃn e conﬁguration Fis
by proving polyconvexity of WatF, which is suﬃcient but rather far from necessary. In
two dimensions it reduces to ﬁnding a constant m∈R, such that
W◦(F,H)−mdetH≥0,∀H∈R2×2. (2.5)

on the jump set the only value of mthat could possibly work is,
m=/a\}b∇acketle{t[[P]],cof[[F]]/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
|[[F]]|2. (2.6)
Secondary jump set. The jump set described by (2.3) identiﬁes the points on the binodal
corresponding to nucleation of a layer of the new phase in the inﬁnite domain occupied by
the original phase. As we have already mentioned, the entire jump s et lies in the closure
of the binodal region [23] and as such represents a bound on the bin odal from the inside.
Another such bound is provided by testing stability of the homogene ous phase with respect
to nucleation of a twinned layer, or a second rank laminate. Mathema tically, we can treat it
as a jump set of a partially relaxed energy W, deﬁned by W(F) =λW(F+)+(1−λ)W(F−),
whereF=λF++(1−λ)F−, and where F±is the corresponding pair on the jump set. Thus,
the secondary jump set is deﬁned by the system of equations


F=F+b⊗m,
Pm=Pm,
PTb=PTb,
W(F)−W=Pm·b,(2.7)
where
W=λW(F+)+(1−λ)W(F−),P=λP++(1−λ)P−, (2.8)
7for some λ∈[0,1], which also plays the role of a variable to be solved for in (2.7), along
withF,b/\e}atio\slash= 0, and |m|= 1. It is clear that the so deﬁned secondary jump set represents
another bound on the binodal region from within.
Nucleation criterion. Yet another method of probing the binodal is to study the nucle-
ation of bounded inclusions either of a prescribed shape [7, 40, 38] o r of an optimal shape
which must be determined [33, 42, 34]. The theory justifying why the se tests probe the bin-
odal was developed in [24]. In the case of “nucleation of a bounded inc lusion”, the criterion
forF0to be “marginally stable”, i.e. to lie in the closure of B, is the existence of a ﬁeld
φ∈ S={φ∈L2
loc(Rn) :∇φ∈L2(Rn;Rn)},
such that
∇·P(F0+∇φ) = 0,∇·P∗(F0+∇φ) = 0 (2.9)
in the sense of distribution in Rn, where
P(F) =WF(F),P∗(F) =W(F)In−FTP(F),
and where the solution φsatisﬁes the non-degeneracy condition
/integraldisplay
RnW◦
F(F0,∇φ)dx/\e}atio\slash= 0. (2.10)
In the case of nucleation of a bounded inclusion ωwith smooth boundary the veriﬁcation of
(2.9) consists in checking that the ﬁeld φ∈ Ssolves∇·P(F0+∇φ) = 0 both inside and
outside of ω, together with the condition that the traces F±(x) =F0+∇φ±(x) on the two
sides of∂ωform a corresponding pair on the jump set for each x∈∂ω. If, in addition, we
can somehow prove that F+∇φ(x) is stable in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.2, for each x∈Rn,
thenF0must lie on the binodal. Conversely, if it is known that F0is stable, then all matrices
F(x) =F0+∇φ(x) are stable for all x∈Rn.
3 The Hadamard material
In this paper we focus on a particularly simple, yet nontrivial energy
W(F) =µ
2|F|2+h(d),F∈ {F∈GL(n) : detF>0}, d= detF,(3.1)
whereh(d) is aC2(0,+∞) function with a double-well shape. In our explicit computations
and illustrations we use the quartic double-well energy2
h(d) = (d−d1)2(d−d2)2, (3.2)
2Formula (3.2) only needs to hold in an arbitrary neighborhood of [ d1,d2]. The potential h(d) can be
modiﬁed outside of that neighborhood arbitrarily, as long as h∗∗(d) =h(d) there. In particular, the singular
behavior of h(d) asd→0+, required in nonlinear elasticity, can be easily assured.
8which aﬀordscertain simpliﬁcation of general formulas. Inthis sect ion we provide anapprox-
imation for the binodal of this energy, even though its quasiconvex envelope is not known.
We begin with the computation of the jump set for this class of mater ials.
The jump set. In Appendix A we summarize, for the sake of completeness, the disc ussion
of the jump set from [27], which is adapted to our two-dimensional se tting.
The main result of the Appendix A is that the jump set of (3.1) consist s of matrices F±,
whose two singular values labelled3ε0andε±satisfy the equations
ε0[[h′]]+µ[[ε]] = 0,[[h]]−{ {h′} }[[d]] = 0, d±= detF±=ε0ε±. (3.3)
The ﬁrst equation in (3.3) is equivalent to (A.4) if we recall the deﬁnitio n ofd±, given in the
third equation in (3.3). Our notation reﬂects the fact that for eac h pairF±on the jump set
there is a frame in which both matrices are diagonal and share the sa me singular value ε0
with the same eigenvector.
Equations (3.3) can be now used to derive the semi-explicit parametr ic equations of the
jump set, with d+=ε0ε+, serving as a parameter. Given d+we can use the second equation
in (3.3) to solve for d−. This solution will be denoted d−=D(d+). Multiplying the ﬁrst
equation in (3.3) by ε0we obtain the parametric equations


ε0(d+) =/radicalig
−µ[[d]]
[[h′]],
ε+(d+) =d+
ε0(d+).
In the special case of potential (3.2) further simpliﬁcations can be made. For example,
[[h]]−{ {h′} }[[d]] = [[d]]3(d1+d2−d+−d−),
and therefore, d−=d1+d2−d+=:D(d+). It then follows that
{ {h′} }= 0, ε ++ε−=d1+d2
ε0. (3.4)
In particular, we can eliminate h′(d±) using (3.3) and (3.4) to obtain:
h′(d±) ={ {h′} }±1
2[[h′]] =∓µ
2[[ε]]
ε0. (3.5)
Moreover, for quartic energy (3.2) we can write the equation of th e jump set explicitly as
ε±=ε±(ε0) whereε±=d±/ε0, andd±solves
(d±−d1)(d±−d2) =−µ
4ε2
0. (3.6)
3We use the notation ±to make two statements at the same time, one for the “+” sign, the other for the
“−” sign. For example, our statement says that the matrix F+has two singular values ε0andε+and the
matrixF−has two singular values ε0andε−.
9The two roots of (3.6) are the values of d±, where, by convention, we denote by d+the
larger root. Equation (3.6) has exactly two real roots whenever ε0>√µ/(d2−d1). Hence,
explicitly,

d1+d2±/radicalbigg
(d2−d1)2−µ

, ε 0≥√µ
d2−d1. (3.7)
In our calculations we will use equations (3.5) to eliminate all occurren ces ofh′(d±) and
equations (3.7) to eliminate ε±, both uniquely determined by a single parameter ε0.

values of µ. The convexiﬁcation hyperbolas ε1ε2=d1,2are shown by blue dotted lines. The
bold black lines show stable part of the jump set. The dashed black line s represent the
unstable part of the jump set. The W-points are represented by r ed dots and dashed-dotted
lines show the rank-one connections between the W-points. The sh aded region is the part
of the binodal region delimited by the jump set. Its interior is unstab le.
Numerical illustrations. Whenµis suﬃciently large the jump set is known to comprise
the entire binodal [27]. Since each point of such binodal correspond s to the nucleation of
a simple laminate, one immediately obtains an explicit formula for the rela xationQW(F).
However, as the shear modulus µdecreases, parts of the jump set may become unstable
which will also aﬀect the structure of QW(F). To illustrate this point we show in Fig. 3 the
jump sets in the case when h(d) is given by (3.2), and the three diﬀerent values of the shear
modulus µare chosen to be of the form µ= 0,µtop/3, and 1.5µtop, whereµtopis the largest
value ofµfor which the jump set has points of self-intersection. In Fig. 3 the dotted lines
indicate “convexiﬁcation hyperbolas”, i.e., hyperbolas ε2=d1/ε1andε2=d2/ε1, where
the interval [ d1,d2] is the interval on which h(d) diﬀers from its convex hull. The shaded
region delimited by the jump set is unstable, while all points outside of t he region bounded
by the convexiﬁcation hyperbolas are stable. It will be our main goal to specify the precise
boundary of the unstable domain in the limit µ→0.
W-points. In [26] we have shown that the easily computable corollary of the Weie rstrass
condition (2.4) for the energy (3.1) has the form
ε0≥ε±. (3.8)
10In [27] we have shown that this condition is always satisﬁed for large v alues ofµas is evident
from the right panel in Fig. 3, while it has an obvious geometric interpr etation in the middle
panel in which the part of the jump set failing (3.8) is shown as a dashe d line. The points
marked by red dots in Fig. 3 that delimit the part of the jump set satis fying (3.8) will be
called the Weierstrass points or W-points, for short. It will be show n in [29] that the solid
portion of the jump set delimited by W-points is polyconvex for all suﬃ ciently small µ.
Polyconvexity of W-points. By their nature W-points are either unstable or delimit the
boundary of stability of the jump set. Our intuition, to be justiﬁed in [29], is that the larger
the shear component of a point on the jump set the more stable it is. Thus, the range of µ
for which W-points are polyconvex is also the range of µfor which the part of the jump set
with larger shear, delimited by W-points is polyconvex.
One can provide an almost explicit characterization of all values of µfor which W-points
are also points of polyconvexity assuming the quartic nonlinearity (3 .2). Indeed, as discussed
above, in order to prove the polyconvexity of W-points we need to e stablish (2.5), where m
is given by (2.6). This problem has been already analyzed in [27], and we brieﬂy summarize
here the obtained results for the sake of completeness.
Establishing (2.5) for the energy (3.1) is equivalent to showing that
Ψ(F) =µ
2|F−F±|2+h(detF)−h±−h′
±/a\}b∇acketle{tcofF±,F−F±/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht−mdet(F−F±) (3.9)
is globally minimized by F±. Our notation in (3.9) emphasizes the fact that either choice of
sign inF±results in one and the same function Ψ( F).
Weﬁrstobservedthattheminimizer ofΨ( F)mustbeacriticalpoint, sinceΨ( F)→+∞,
when|F| → ∞. We then showed that at all points on the jump set, except the poin ts of
self-intersection, the critical points Fmust be diagonal in the same frame as F±. Denoting
byxandythe two diagonal entries of Fwe obtain
Ψ(F) = Φ(x,y)+const ,
where
Φ(x,y) =µ
2(x2+y2)−αx−βy+h(xy)−mxy,
α=µ(ε++ε−), β=µ/parenleftbigg
ε0+ε+ε−
ε0/parenrightbigg
, m=[[h′d]]
[[d]]. (3.10)
Whenwe minimized Φ( x,y)over all( x,y), such that xy=dweconcluded thattheminimizer
is (d/y,y), where y=y(d) is the largest root of
y4−β0y3+dα0y−d2= 0, α0=ε++ε−, β0=ε0+ε+ε−
ε0. (3.11)
Thus, the minimum of Φ( x,y) is achieved at a ﬁnite point corresponding to a critical point
ofφ(d) = Φ(d/y(d),y(d)).
In the special case of W-points we have4ε+=ε0and therefore α0=β0=ε−+ε0. In
this case equation (3.11) factors
(y2−d)(y2−α0y+d) = 0. (3.12)
4Technically, at the W-points there could be other, not necessarily d iagonal critical states, however, by
continuity, the diagonal critical points would still deliver the global m inimum of Ψ( F).
11The largest root is y=1
2(α0+/radicalig
α2
0−4d), provided 0 < d≤α2
0/4. Ifd > α2
0/4, then the
quartic has only two real roots y=±√
d. Thus,
y(d) =/braceleftigg
(α0+/radicalbig

Now,
φ(d) = min
y∈R{Φ0(d/y,y)+h(d)−md},Φ0(x,y) =µ
2(x2+y2)−αx−βy
Therefore,
φ′(d) =1
y(d)∂Φ0
∂x(d/y,y)+h′(d)−m=µd−α0y(d)
y(d)2+h′(d)−m.
In the case of W-points for which y(d) solves (3.12) we see that
d−α0y(d)
y(d)2=−1
whend≤α2
0/4. Hence, any critical point of φ(d) in this regime would have to satisfy
h′(d)−µ−m= 0.
One of the solutions is d−, which always satisﬁes d−≤α2
0/4. If this equation has 3 solutions,
the middle one corresponds to a local maximum of φ(d), while the third d∗> d+always fails
to satisfy d∗≤α2
0/4 because d+=ε2
0>(ε−+ε0)2/4, due to (3.8). We conclude that the
only critical points of φ(d) that need to be checked are the ones that satisfy d > α2
0/4. In
this regime y(d)2=d, and
φ′(d) =µ/parenleftbigg
1−α0√

+h′(d)−m.
Observe that φ′(d)>0 whend≥max(α2
0,/tildewided+), where/tildewided+is the largest root of h′(d)−m.
Hence we only need to check for critical points in a speciﬁc bounded in terval. In fact, if
h(d) is given by (3.2), then it is easy to see that φ′(d)>0 for all d≥α2
0. Hence, we only
need to check for critical points of φ(d) on (α2
0/4,α2
0). In addition, since { {h′} }= 0, for
h(d) given by (3.2), we have m=−µ{ {ε} }/ε0=−µα0/(2ε0). Thus, we obtain the following
characterization of polyconvexity of W-points.

whereα0=ε0+ε−, with(ε0,ε−),(ε−,ε0), and(ε0,ε0)being the coordinates of W-points.
12The right-hand side in (3.13) is just φ(ε2
0), where φ(d) is the function being minimized
in (3.13). For quartic energy (3.2) we compute the coordinates of W -points by solving
−4d(d−d1)(d−d2) =µ.
Thenε2
0is the largest root, and
ε−=d1+d2−ε2
0
ε0.
We can compute the largest value of µfor which (3.13) holds by substituting µ=−4ε2
0(ε2
0−
d1)(ε2
0−d2) into (3.13) and regarding ε0≤√d2as a parameter. When ε0=√d2,φ(d)−φ(d2)
is a positive polynomial in x=√
d. We then seek numerically the largest value of ε0<√d2for which the polynomial P(x) = (φ(x2)−φ(ε2
0))/(x−ε0)2develops a double root.
Algebraically this means seeking the largest root ε0<√d2of the discriminant. This solution
gives the largest value of µbelow which the W-points are polyconvex. For example, when
d1= 1,d2= 3, we have polyconvexity of W-points for all µ <6.35888. When µincreases
past that value it enters a regime where the W-points are no longer p olyconvex, but could
still be quasiconvex. Increasing µeven further, we enter a regime where W-points fail a more
sophisticated stability test from [26]. The exact value of µ, where W-points stop being stable
is unknown. In this paper we are working exclusively in the regime of su ﬃciently small µ,
when W-points are polyconvex.
Secondary jump set. For general values of µthe algebraic equations (2.7) describing
the secondary jump set can be solved only numerically. By contrast , whenµis small, the
asymptotics of the solutions can be obtained explicitly, providing an e xcellent approximation
to the computed secondary jump set for µ <3, withd1= 1,d2= 3. While the entire
secondary jump set is unstable, as will be proved in [29], we will see tha t it provides an
excellent (inside) bound for the binodal. Here we specialize general e quations (2.7) to the
speciﬁc energy density (3.1) without assuming that the rigidity meas ureµis small.
Suppose that F0lies on the secondary jump set. Then there exists ε±,yandλ∈[0,1],
such that the pair F0,F, where

These equations result in 3 possibilities:

be shown that in the cases (a) and (b) there are no solutions. Let u s therefore assume that
F±is diagonal and has the form

(3.15)
Next, in (3.15) we replace d0/εby its expression from (3.14). As a result of such substitution
the Maxwell relation will also become a quadratic equation in ε. This permits us to eliminate
this variable as a rational expression in terms of ε0andd0. The Maxwell relation will then
reduce to a rational relation between d0andε0.
The implied calculation can only be done with the aid of a computer algebr a system,
since the remaining equation F(ε0,d0) = 0 is very long and complicated. For a given choice
of numerical values of µ,d1andd2we can then solve F(ε0,d0) = 0 numerically and extract
the solutions which satisfy λ∈[0,1]. The result for d1= 1,d2= 2 and µ=µtop/3 is shown
as a green curve in Fig. 4. As we can see, it identiﬁes all points betwee n the green curve and
the dashed lines of the primary jump set as a part of the binodal reg ion—an improvement
over the primary jump set bound.
As shown in the right panel of Fig. 4, the secondary jump set consis ts of two curves
related by symmetry with respect to the bisector of the ﬁrst quad rant. Each curve starts

at a W-point and ends at a point (not marked) on the dashed part of the jump set. The
endpoints of the secondary jump set correspond to the extreme values 0 and 1 of the volume
fractionλin (2.8) and must lie on the primary jump set. There are two possibilities . Either
F/\e}atio\slash=ForF=Fatλ= 0 or 1. In the former case the limiting position F+ofFis rank-one
related to two diﬀerent points on the jump set: F−(layer normal e1) andF(layer normal
e2). The W-point F+is the only one with this property. All other points F+on the jump set
have a unique counterpart F−. In the latter case a detailed asymptotic analysis shows that
that the common limit point of FandFmust achieve equality in the “Legendre-Hadamard
for phase boundaries” inequality from [26]. When µis small, this point lies on the dashed
part of the jump set and is used in numerical calculations. The techn ical details of the
analysis will be reported elsewhere. The sections of each of the two curves from the W-point
to the bisector of the quadrant form a part of the boundary of th e new shaded region of
unstable points.
Circular nucleus. As we have already mentioned, the secondary jump set (shown in
green in Fig. 4) is unstable [29]. That means that the corresponding b ound on the binodal
is not optimal. To improve this bound we can use another method of pr obing the binodal:
nucleation of bounded equilibrium energy-neutral inclusions. The th eory justifying why such
nucleation tests probe the binodal was developed in [24].
In the case of the isotropic, objective energy (3.1) and a hydrost atic loading it would
be natural to assume that the shape of an optimal precipitate is cir cular. The deformation

the circular boundary of the inclusion to ﬁelds F(x). In order for such a conﬁguration to be
able to probe the binodal, F0andF(x) must be corresponding pairs on the jump set. There
is only one point on the jump set satisfying these requirements F0=εW
0I2, where ( εW
0,εW
0)
is the W-point that lies on the quadrant bisector. As required, the ﬁ eldF0is rank-one

where (εW

outside of the circular inclusion must solve an Euler-Lagrange equat ion for the energy (3.1)
µ∆y+(cof∇y)∇h′(det∇y) = 0,x∈R2\B(0,1), (3.16)
and agree with FRat the point Re1on the boundary of the circular inclusion:
∇y(x) =εW
−n⊗n+εW
0n⊥⊗n⊥,x∈∂B(0,1). (3.17)
Under these conditions, both equations (2.9) will be satisﬁed for th e possibly marginally
stable matrix
F∞= lim
|x|→∞∇y(x) =ε∞I2.
We also know that that the values of ∇y(x) inside the circular inclusion and its trace on
the outside boundary of the inclusion must be stable. Our results fr om [24] then say that
there are two possibilities. The ﬁrst one is that F∞lies on the binodal and all values ∇y(x)
in the exterior of the inclusion are stable. The second option is that F∞lies in the interior
of the binodal region B.
In our special radially symmetric case we look for a radially symmetric s olution of (3.16)
y=η(r)ˆx,|x|>1.

The nonlinear second order ODE (3.18) cannot be integrated explicit ly, but can be solved
numerically. In order to do so, we need to convert the inﬁnite range r >1 into a ﬁnite one
by means of the change of the independent variable x= 1/r2. It will also be convenient to
change the dependent variable v=η/r, so that v(x) would have a ﬁnite limit, when x→0.
Thenv(x) solves

2.(3.19)
The value ε∞=v(0)I2, which was found numerically, is shown as a blue dot in Fig. 6.
While we still cannot say whether the corresponding value F∞indeed lies in the binodal, we
obtained an improved bound on the binodal compared to the second ary jump set (green line
in Fig. 6) by showing that hydrostatic strains between the blue dot a nd the green line are
17unstable. The conclusion holds, provided the non-degeneracy con dition (2.10) is veriﬁed. A
direct calculation shows that

r→∞(rη(r)−ε∞r2).
To see that the limit above exists and is non-zero, at least for suﬃcie ntly small µ >0, we
simply solve (3.18) for µ= 0, for which εW
0=√d2,εW
−=d1√d2. The solution is η(r) =√d1r2+d2−d1, and we easily see that
lim
r→∞(rη(r)−ε∞r2) =d2−d1
2√d1.
Hence, the non-degeneracy condition (2.10) will hold for suﬃciently smallµ >0. The
non-degeneracy will also hold for all µbelow the topological transition, because if we write
/tildewideη(r) =η(r)−ε∞r, then (assuming that /tildewideη′(r)→0, asr→ ∞)/tildewideη(r) will solve, when ris

This integrates to

Since/tildewideη, satisfying/tildewideη′(r)→0, asr→ ∞, cannot be zero (it is the leading term of η(r)−ε∞r),
we conclude that the constant of integration ccannot be zero either. Hence, we obtain that

Polyconvexity limits along εI2.In an attempt to prove stability of the point ε∞I2we
turn to the problem of polyconvexity at points F=εI2. The problem reduces to ﬁnding a
constant m∈R, such that (2.5) holds. For our energy we compute
W◦(F,H) =µ
2|H|2+h(ε2+d+εθ)−h(ε2)−εh′(ε2)θ, θ= TrH, d= detH.
We also have
|H|2= 4s2−2d+θ2,
where

.
18The set of all admissible values of ( θ,d,s) is described by the inequality5s2≥d−θ2/4.
Thus, proving that W◦(εI2,H)≥mdetHfor allHis equivalent to proving that
2µmax/braceleftbigg

+µθ2
2+h(ε2+d+εθ)−h(ε2)−εh′(ε2)θ≥(m+µ)d.

4,(3.20)
and
h(ε2+d+εθ)−h(ε2)−εh′(ε2)θ≥(m−µ)d,∀d≥θ2
4. (3.21)
In particular both inequalities must hold for d=θ2/4. In that case we must have
m≤µ+4min
θ∈Rh(ε2+θ2/4+εθ)−h(ε2)−εh′(ε2)θ
θ2=m∗. (3.22)
Changing variables δ=ε2+d+εθwe obtain that F=εI2is polyconvex if and only if there
existsm≤m∗, such that
inf
δ≤(ε+θ/2)2F1(δ,θ)≥0, F1(δ,θ) =µθ2

The case (3.24) is clear, because F2(δ,θ) is linear in θand the minimum is always achieved
on the boundary of the admissible domain, i.e. δ= (ε+θ/2)2or, equivalently, d=θ2/4. In
this case inequality (3.24) holds whenever m≤m∗.
The function F1(δ,θ) is quadratic in θand therefore achieves its minimal value either on
the boundary, corresponding to d=θ2/4 or at the critical point, satisfying
θ=ε(h′(ε2)−m−µ)
µ, h′(δ) =m+µ, (3.25)
provided δ≤(θ/2+ε)2, which holds if and only if
δ≤ε2(h′(ε2)+µ−m)2
4µ2. (3.26)
We remark that taking θ=−4εin (3.22) we infer that m∗≤µ+h′(ε2). Thus, the right-hand
side of (3.26) is monotone decreasing in m, whenm≤m∗.
Let/tildewided1</tildewided2be the two inﬂection points of h(d). The point /tildewided1is the point of local
maximum of h′(d), while/tildewided2is the point of local minimum of h′(d). There are several cases,
depending on the value of m∗.
5This inequality is equivalent to |dev(H)|2≥0, where 2dev( H) =H+HT−(TrH)I2.
19•Ifm∗+µ > h′(/tildewided1), then equation h′(δ) =m∗+µhas a unique solution δ∗. Ifδ=δ∗
fails (3.26) with m=m∗, then we have polyconvexity with m=m∗, sinceF1(δ,θ)
has no critical points in d < θ2/4. Ifδ=δ∗satisﬁes (3.26), then, if f(δ∗)≥0, then
polyconvexity holds with m=m∗. Here
f(δ) =F2(δ,θ(δ)) =h(δ)−h(ε2)−h′(δ)(δ−ε2)−ε2(h′(δ)−h′(ε2))2
2µ.(3.27)
Iff(δ∗)<0, then we can try to ﬁnd a better choice for m < m∗. In this case,
all solutions δofh′(δ) =m+µwill be smaller than δ∗and therefore (3.26) will be
satisﬁed for all roots of h′(δ) =m+µ, for any m≤m∗. Polyconvexity will hold if
f(δ)≥0 for all roots of h′(δ) =m+µfor some choice of m≤m∗.
•Ifm∗+µ < h′(/tildewided2), then equation h′(δ) =m∗+µhas a unique solution δ∗. Ifδ=δ∗
fails (3.26) with m=m∗, then we have polyconvexity with m=m∗, since in the case
F1(δ,θ) has no critical points in d < θ2/4. Ifδ=δ∗satisﬁes (3.26), then, for any
m≤m∗there will be a unique solution δofh′(δ) =m+µ, satisfying δ≤δ∗. In this
case polyconvexity fails if and only if f(δ)<0 for allδ < δ∗.
•Ifm∗+µ∈(h′(/tildewided2),h′(/tildewided1)), thenh(δ) =m∗+µhas 3 real roots. If even the smallest
rootδ∗does not satisfy (3.26) with m=m∗, then polyconvexity holds, since F1(δ,θ)
has no critical points. If the smallest root δ∗satisﬁes (3.26), then the smallest root of
h(δ) =m+µwill satisfy (3.26) for all m≤m∗. Then, if f(δ)<0 for allδ≤δ∗, then
polyconvexity fails. However, if there are values of δ≤δ∗, such that f(δ)≥0, then it
does not imply polyconvexity. For polyconvexity to hold we must have f(δ)≥0 for
allroots ofh′(δ) =m+µ, which satisfy (3.26).
More clarity regarding which case we need to deal with can be obtaine d in the limit µ→0.
4 Limiting case µ→0
In the previous section we have derived equations of the secondar y jump set, conditions for
polyconvexity of points εI2and a diﬀerential equation implicitly determining the nucleation
boundε∞I2. In the asymptotic limit µ→0 these implicit conditions can be made explicit.
We emphasize that we consider here the family of two-well Hadamard materials with ﬁxed
nonlinear potential h(d) and variable µ→0.

Sinced1andd2are ﬁxed, we consider the strains ε±as functions of ε0andµ, even if we
suppress this in the notations. Clearly, when µ→0 we have ε+→d2/ε0,ε−→d1/ε0.
The parametric equations ( x0(ε0;µ),y0(ε0;µ)) of secondary jump set converge, when
µ→0, to the hyperbola x0y0=d1. In particular, d0(ε0,µ)→d1, asµ→0. The volume
20fractionλof the rank-one laminate used in the second rank laminate is also a fun ction of
ε0andµand must have a limit (at least along a subsequence) λ(ε0;µ)→λ0(ε0), asµ→0.

with the requirement that d≥d1we obtain the inequality

In fact, this is not necessary because the leading order asymptot ics ofd0isa constant d1.
In that case, as far as the ﬁrst order asymptotics as µ→0 is concerned, using (4.7) simply
corresponds to reparametrizing the curve

Figure 5 shows the quality of the asymptotics for the entire range o f shear moduli µ. The

asymptotics (4.12) gives a good approximation of the actual value o fε∞. For example, for
µ= 3 the relative discrepancy is only around 0.1%.
Polyconvexity limits along εI2.Ifµ= 0, then we know that polyconvexity along εI2
holds whenever ε/\e}atio\slash∈[√d1,√d2]. In this limiting case our analysis of polyconvexity applied
toε=√d1starts with the minimization problem (3.22), which simpliﬁes6:
m≤min
θ∈Rh(d1+θ√d1+θ2/4)
θ2= 0 =m∗. (4.13)
We ﬁrst observe that in general θ= 0 is not a minimizer. Then there are 3 minimizers:
θ=−4/radicalbig
d1, θ=±2/radicalbig
d2−2/radicalbig
d1.
Whenµis positive but small, we examine the polyconvexity of points ε=√d1+x, where
xis small. We know that as xincreases, the polyconvexity will fail before εI2reaches the
point on the secondary jump set, which is known to be unstable. Hen ce, we may regard the

23variablexto be of order µ, which permits us to compute the asymptotics of all quantities
necessary to establish polyconvexity.
Whenx >0, the minimizer θ(x) of (3.22) must be located near one of the above 3
minimizers of (4.13). We can then write θ=θ0+yfor the minimizer, where θ0denotes one
of the 3. If we write the function under the minimum as H(ε,θ), then at the minimum we
must have ∂H/∂θ= 0, which gives the equation
x∂2H
∂θ∂ε+y∂2H
∂θ2= 0
relating the inﬁnitesimals xandy. After solving for yand substituting back into Hwe
obtain

This shows that θ= 2√d2−2√d1+yis the minimizer, while
m∗=µ−4xd1√d2−√d1h′′(d1)+O(x2).
In particular, the equation h′(δ) =m∗+µwill have 3 real roots. Let us determine how many
of them satisfy (3.26), which in the limit µ→0,x→0 reads
δ≤/parenleftbigg

The smallest root δ∗ofh′(δ) =m∗+µhas the asymptotics
δ∗=d1+µ+m∗

Therefore, it will fail (4.14), when

Ifxis larger than the upper bound (4.15), then δ∗satisﬁes (4.14).
Let us now show that in this case f(δ)<0 for allδ≤δ∗for suﬃciently small µ. Indeed,
h′(δ) is a monotone increasing function on δ≤δ∗. Therefore, either δis close to d1or

h′(δ)−h′(ε2) is not small. In the latter case f(δ), given by (3.27) is clearly negative, as its

OurFig.6, where εpcxI2isrepresented bythereddot, showsthat ε∞I2failstobepolyconvex,
but by a very slim margin. Our numerical investigations (to be report ed elsewhere) shows
that the ordering of the bounds in Fig. 6 persists on the entire rang e ofµ. In Fig. 6 we see
that the remaining gap between established stability (along the bisec tor below the red dot)
and established instability (along the bisector above the blue dot) is v ery small.
5 A glimpse into the relaxed energy
Hypothetical bounds on the binodal. We have seen in the foregoing discussion that the energy
W(F) is not polyconvex at F=ε∞I2. This is not very surprising, since polyconvexity is
usually strictly stronger that quasiconvexity and we expect and co njecture that F=ε∞I2
lies on the binodal—at the very edge of quasiconvexity.
25First, we recall our observation that if F=ε∞I2is stable, then for every |x|>1 the
deformation gradients
∇y(x) =η′(r)ˆx⊗ˆx+η(r)
r(I2−ˆx⊗ˆx)
are also stable in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.2. This observation would th en provide a bound
on the whole binodal from the outside.
Note next that for the entire range of µfor which W-points are polyconvex the union of
the curves /braceleftigg

appear as almost indistinguishable from the secondary jump set cur ves shown in green in
Fig. 4. This is more clear in Fig. 7 showing the blown-up part of the stra in space from
Fig. 6, where the curves (5.1) shown in magenta are meeting at the b lue point from Fig. 6
entering it with slope −1. Assuming the conjectured stability of ε∞I2, the magenta curve
must lie outside of the binodal region, while secondary jump set lies in it s interior. Thus,
the binodal of the energy (3.1) would have to lie between the green a nd the magenta curves.
We conjecture that the magenta curve is in fact the actual binoda l of the energy (3.1).
Independently of whether this more general conjecture is true, the magenta line represents
a rather tight outside bound on the binodal region which hinges only o n a more modest
assumption of the stability of ε∞I2.

solution ∇y(x) =η(r)ˆxof (3.18) is also a global minimizer in every ﬁnite ball B(0,R),

us to compute QW(εI2) for allε, as the energy of conﬁgurations y(x) =η(r)ˆxinB(0,R).

6 Conclusions
In this paper we posed the problem of solving analytically the relaxatio n problem for the
double well Hadamard energy (3.1) in two space dimensions in the limit wh en the rigidity
measureµissuﬃciently small. However, we onlysucceeded inattaininga much mor emodest
goal of locating a substantial part of the corresponding binodal r egion in the strain space.
To deal analytically with these challenging questions, we used some of our previously
developed methods centered around the computation of the jump set and the identiﬁcation
27of its stable part. While our general methods apply for Hadamard ma terials in the entire
parameter range and are amenable to numerical implementation, in t his paper we have
chosen to focus only on explicit asymptotic study of the “near-liquid ” regime.
In particular, we managed to show that in this limit, a subset of the ju mp set adjacent
to the high strain phase remains stable which ensures that simple lamin ation delivers the
corresponding part of the binodal. This means that even when the p arameter µis inﬁnitesi-
mally small, the high strain phase maintains its tangential rigidity at the level which ensures
solid-solid like nature of the incipient phase transition.
By contrast, our analysis showed that the subset of the jump set adjacent to the low
strain and low energy phase is unstable in the µ→0 limit. Moreover, the secondary jump
set is also unstable in this limit. This result implies that laminates of any ﬁniterank are
unstable and cannot be associated to any part of the binodal in tha t regime.
Whether the revealed asymmetry of the transformation mechanis m between the direct
andreverse transformationis a peculiarity of theHadamard mater ial or whether this striking
phenomenon has a more general nature, remains to be established . It shows, however,
the intricate role of rigidity in structural transformations which, e ven if weak, can produce
complex microstructural morphologies underlying therelaxed ener gy. This complexity shows
that, rather remarkably, the elastic long-range interactions rem ain relevant even when the
system is arbitrarily close to the liquid regime. In other words, the dis appearing rigidity
can be viewed as the microstructure selection mechanism for the Ha damard liquid which
otherwisecomes withaninﬁniterepertoireofpossibleaccommodatio nmechanisms allhaving
zero energetic cost.
In order toreconcile thesolid-like features ofthe behavior of then ear-liquid material with
the behavior of its purely “liquid” limit one can turn from the study of g lobal minima of the
energy to the study of almost-minimizers whose energy is only slightly above the energy of
the ground state. In this case the richness of the repertoire of p urely liquid microstructures
corresponding to µ= 0 can be recovered in the form of such almost-minimizers of the
Hadamard solid with µsuﬃciently small but ﬁnite. The physical merit of these projections
must be weighed against other factors that have been neglected in our study, such as surface
energy, crystal anisotropy, spatial inhomogeneity and dynamics .

28A Calculation of the jump set for Hadamard materials
Here we recall the calculation of the jump set from [27] for energies (3.1).
We start with the ﬁrst equation in (2.3) expressing the kinematic com patibility of the
deformation gradients F+andF−. Taking the determinant of both sides we obtain
d+=d−+cofF−n·a, d±= detF±. (A.1)
Using the formula
P(F) =µF+h′(detF)cofF
for the Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress we compute
[[P]]n=µa+[[h′]]cofF−n,
where we have used the well-known relation cof( F−+a⊗n)n= (cofF−)n. Similarly,
[[P]]Ta=µ|a|2n+[[h′]]cofFT
−a.
Thus, the second and the third equations in (2.3) become
a=−[[h′]]
µcofF−n,[[h′]]2cof(C−)n=µ2|a|2n, (A.2)
whereC±=FT
±F±is the Cauchy-Green strain tensor. We conclude that nmust be an
eigenvector of C−. Equations (A.2) permit us to ﬁnd a relation between the two Cauchy -
Green tensors C±. Using the kinematic compatibility equation (2.3) 1we compute
C+=C−+FT
−a⊗n+n⊗FT
−a+|a|2n⊗n.
Applying FT
−to the ﬁrst equation in (A.2) we obtain FT
−a=−([[h′]]/µ)d−n, so that
[[C]] =/parenleftbigg
|a|2−2[[h′]]d−
µ/parenrightbigg
n⊗n. (A.3)
It follows that the Cauchy-Green tensors C+andC−are simultaneously diagonalizable,
since, by (A.2) nis an eigenvector of C−. According to equation (A.3) symmetric matrices
C+andC−have the same pair of mutually orthogonal eigenvectors nandn⊥with the same
eigenvalues corresponding to n⊥. Hence, singular values of F±would be ( ε±,ε0), the ﬁrst
one corresponding to the eigenvector nofC±. Substituting the ﬁrst equation in (A.2) into
(A.1) we obtain
d+=d−−[[h′]]
µcofC−n·n=d−−[[h′]]d2
−
µε2
−,
which can be written in the more symmetric form as
µ[[d]]
[[h′]]=−ε2
0=−d2
±
ε2
±. (A.4)
29This will be the equation for the jump set, when we determine d+as a function of d−from
the Maxwell relation (the last equation in (2.3), which hasn’t been use d so far). It is well-
known that the Maxwell relation does not change if we add any quadr atic function in Fto
the energy. Thus, the term µ|F|2/2 can be disregarded and the Maxwell relation becomes
[[h]] ={ {h′cofF} }n·a.
Recalling that due to (A.1) (cof F+)n·a= (cofF−)n·a= [[d]] we obtain
[[h]] ={ {h′} }[[d]]. (A.5)
Equation (A.5) has a geometric meaning. It says that the secant line joining (d−,h′(d−)) and
(d−,h′(d−)) together with the graph of h′(d) bound two regions of equal areas. For a double-
well shaped potential h(d) there exists a single interval ( d1,d2) on which h(d) diﬀers from its
convex hull, which on ( d1,d2) agrees with the common tangent line at d1andd2to the graph
ofh(d). In terms of h′(d) this double-tangency can also be interpreted geometrically as the
horizontal “Maxwell line” with the equal area property. In that ca se there exist d0∈(d1,d2),
such that for any d−∈(d1,d0) there is a unique d+∈(d0,d2) satisfying (A.5). Moreover, for
everyd−∈(d1,d0) there is a unique d+=D(d−) with equal area property. (By continuity
we can set D(d0) =d0.) Regarding the function D(d) as known, equation (A.4) provides the
explicit description of the jump set in terms of the singular values of F±.
