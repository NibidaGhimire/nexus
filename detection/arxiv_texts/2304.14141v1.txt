Abstract: In this paper we provide some results concerning the structu re of a multiset Awith
elements from Z×
n, which has non-empty subset sums equally distributed modul on. Here,Z×
n
denotes the set which contains all the invertible elements o f the ring Zn. In particular, we prove
that ifnbelongs to a certain subset of the natural numbers, then Ais a union of sets of the form
{a·(±2i)}. Additionally, we count the number of subsets of Z×
qwith non-empty subset sums
equally distributed modulo q, ifqis an odd prime power.
Keywords: Subset sums, equidistribution, prime numbers.
1 Introduction
LetAbe a multiset of numbers. The sums representable in the form/summationtext
a∈Aǫa·awhereǫa∈ {0,1}
are called the subset sums ofAand the multiset containing allthe subset sums is often denoted
by/summationtext(A)that is,
/summationdisplay
(A) ={/summationdisplay
x∈Bx:B⊆A}
Let/summationtext(A)(s)denote the multiset which contains the/parenleftbig|A|
s/parenrightbig
subset sums of Awhich have size s.
Through the last years there has been a growing interest in th e following problem:
Is it possible to recover A, given/summationtext(A)(s)?
This problem is credited to Leo Moser, who proposed to recove rA, given it’s/parenleftbig|A|
2/parenrightbig
2-subset sums,
if|A|= 5. The general case of this problem was ﬁrst studied by J. L. Sel fridge and E. G. Straus
in [1]. The most recent progress on this problem can be found i n [2], where Andrea Ciprietti and
Federico Glaudo studied this problem from another point of v iew; they proved that for an abelian
groupA, the reconstruction problem is solvable if and only if every order of a torsion element
of the abelian group satisﬁes a certain number-theoretical property. For more related material
1that might satisfy the reader’s curiosity we refer to the sur vey of Dmitri V . Fomin [3]. In this
paper, our main objective is to explicitly determine A, on condition that equidistribution modulo
noccurs among it’s non-emtpy subset sums.
1.1 A preliminary theorem
We begin by giving a proof that the non-empty subset sums of Z×
nare equally distributed modulo
n, ifnis odd (if nis even, this is not possible, as we will see). It seems a near c ertainty that a
proof of this result has already appeared somewhere in the lo ng history of mathematics, but I have
not yet been able to ﬁnd a reference. Thereby, we provide a sim ple proof which does not seem
to appear in the literature and hope also that will be accessi ble to a broad spectrum of readers.
Furthermore, the primary motivation for the arguments we pr esent in this paper arises from the
construction presented in the proof. In the following, ϕ(n)denotes Euler’s totient function which
counts the number of positive integers not greater than n, which are relatively prime to n. We
also deﬁne the order of 2modulon, as the least exponent rfor which the congruence 2r≡1
(modn)holds. Note that from Euler’s theorem we know that r|ϕ(n).
Theorem 1.1. Letn∈Nbe odd. The non-empty subset sums of Z×
nare equally distributed
modulon. In particular, every residue class appears exactly2ϕ(n)−1
ntimes.
Proof. We slightly modify the construction presented by the author in [4]. Let rbe the order of 2
modulonandk=ϕ(n)
r. We consider the following subsets of Z×
n: Fori= 1,...,k , we let
Bi={bi·2m−1(modn) : 1≤m≤r}
with the restriction that (bi,n) = 1 andbi/\e}atio\slash≡bκ·2m−1(modn)forκ < i .
Observe that the subsets Bido not have any element in common. To see this, assume for the s ake
of contradiction that Bi∩Bj/\e}atio\slash=∅for some i,jnot greater than k. Then there is an m′≤r, such
thatbi·2m−1≡bj·2m′−1(modn). From this we obtain that bi≡bj·2m′−m(modn)which is
absurd. Thus, the union of Bicontainsk·r=ϕ(n)distinct elements, which is equivalent to
B1∪B2∪···∪Bk=Z×
n.
In addition, it is evident that the non-empty subset sums of Biproduce every element of the set
Xi={bi·x: 1≤x≤2r−1}, since every binary representation of xoccurs exactly once. Since
n|2r−1and(bi,n) = 1 , the residue classes (modn)are equally distributed (they occur exactly
2r−1
ntimes) in Xiand so do in/summationtext(Bi). It is relatively easy to see that their union also produces
equally distributed subset sums and thus every residue clas s is represented2ϕ(n)−1
ntimes. This
proves the theorem.1
Inspired by the method of the previous proof, we ask the follo wing (converse) question: If the
non-empty subset sums of A⊆Z×
nare equally distributed modulo n, then isAnecessarily the
union of sets consisting of elements which are in “geometric progression” with ratio 2? We show
that for a certain subset of Nthis is almost true. In particular, the main result of this pa per is that
the ratio must be ±2 (modn).
1This method was used also by Euler himself to prove that aϕ(n)≡1 (modn).
22 Main results
In this section we state our main results and provide some key proof techniques and insights.
Before we begin, we would like to mention that in the followin g, Theorems 2.1 and 2.4 are very
similar to proposition 4.1 in [2]. We begin with the followin g.
Theorem 2.1. LetAbe a multiset with elements from N,|A|=kandrbe the order of 2
(modn),n≥3. Suppose that the non-empty subset sums of Aare equally distributed (modn).
Then the following hold true:
2.1.1./producttextk
i=1(1+xai) = 1+R(x)·xn−1
x−1, whereR(x)∈Z[x].
2.1.2.2k≡1 (modn)(which implies that nis odd and r|k).
2.1.3./summationtextk
i=1ai≡0 (modn).
Proof. It is relatively easy to prove 2.1.1 and 2.1.2. First, we expa nd the product/producttextk
i=1(1+xai)
as a polynomial and take every summand moduloxn−1
x−1. If we denote by Amthe number of
non-empty subset sums which are congruent to m(modn), we obtain2
k/productdisplay
i=1(1+xai) = 1+A0x0+A1x1+...+An−1xn−1+Q(x)·xn−1
x−1,
whereQ(x)∈Z[x]. But the subset sums are equidistributed, so Am=2k−1
nfor every m. Thus,
k/productdisplay
i=1(1+xai) = 1+2k−1
n(x0+...+xn−1)+Q(x)·xn−1
x−1,
which proves 2.1.1 with R(x) =2k−1
n+Q(x).
Now we take the limit as xapproaches 1on both sides of 2.1.1 and obtain 2k= 1 +R(1)·n.
SinceR(1)∈Z, we have 2k≡1 (modn)which proves 2.1.2.
To see that/summationtextk
i=1ai≡0 (modn), we differentiate both sides of 2.1.1 and get
k/productdisplay
i=1(1+xai)·k/summationdisplay
i=1aixai−1
1+xai=R′(x)·xn−1
x−1+R(x)·(n−1)xn−nxn−1+1
(x−1)2.
Again, we take the limit of both sides as xapproaches 1. We obtain that
2k−1·k/summationdisplay
i=1ai=R′(1)·n+R(1)n(n−1)
2.
Sincenis odd, the right-hand side is divisible by nand so is the left-hand side. This yields
2k−1·/summationtextk
i=1ai≡0 (modn)and thus/summationtextk
i=1ai≡0 (modn). With this, we proved 2.1.3.
2Here we adopt the convention that the empty sum is 0 (modn)
3Before we state our main theorem, we provide an auxiliary res ult. It appears in [5] and is
presented as two separate theorems. For the convenience of t he reader, we present them together
and slightly reshape them under the restriction that we cons ider only odd numbers. We say that
mis a semi-primitive root (modq)if the order of n(modq)isϕ(q)
2and with ¯Qwe denote the
ﬁeld of algebraic numbers.
Theorem 2.2. (Chatterjee, T., Dhillon, S. [5])
2.2.1. Let q≥3be an odd integer. The elements of
L1={log(2sinaπ
q) : 1≤a≤q−1
2,(a,q) = 1}andπ
are linearly independent over ¯Qif and only if qis a prime power.
2.2.2. Let q≥3be an odd integer with at least two prime divisors. The elemen ts of
L2={log(2sinaπ
q) : 1< a≤q−1
2,(a,q) = 1}andπ
are linearly independent over ¯Qif and only if qsatisﬁes one of the following conditions:
(herea1,a2,a3≥1andp1,p2,p3are odd primes)
(I)q=pa1
1pa2
2; and
(Ia) when p1≡p2≡3 (mod 4) :p1is a semi-primitive root (modpa2
2)andp2is a
semi-primitive root (modpa1
1)or vice versa.
(Ib) Otherwise: p1andp2are primitive roots (modpa2
2)and(modpa1

2),(modpa3
3),(modpa1

semi-primitive roots (modpa3

2), respectively.
In the original paper the number ln2appears among the elements of L1,L2and they also

case whereaπ
q=π
6which implies log(2sinaπ
q) = 0 . Since we consider only odd numbers q, we
disregard this case. We will also make use of the following de ﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 2.1. We say that a set B⊆Z×
nis a geometric progression with ratio lwith leader b, if
every element in Bis of the form b·lj−1(modulon).
Our main result is the following theorem.
Theorem 2.3. LetAbe a multiset with elements from Z×
q,|A|=kandrbe the order of 2
(modq). Suppose that the non-empty subset sums of Aare equally distributed. If
(1)qis an odd prime power or
(2)qsatisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 2.2.2 and 1,q−1
2,q+1
2,q−1/\e}atio\slash∈A
4Then, there are disjoint sets B1,...,B t⊆A, such that A=∪t
i=1Biand each Biis a geometric
progression with leader biand ratio ±2. Additionally, |Bi|=r, for every i≤t.
Proof. We begin by proving the ﬁrst part of the theorem. Let ω=e2πi/qbe aq-th root of
unity where qis a power of an odd prime. From Theorem 2.1.1 we know that/producttextk
i=1(1+xai) =
1+R(x)·xq−1
x−1. Forx=ω, we derive that/producttextk
i=1(1+ωai) = 1 . But,
1+ωai= 2cosπai
q·ei·πai/q.
It follows that
2kk/productdisplay
i=1cosπai
q·eπ·i/summationtextai/q= 1.
We multiply both sides by 2k·/producttextk
i=1sinπai
qand use the identity sin2x= 2cosx·sinx. Also note
that from Theorem 2.1.3, q|/summationtextk
i=1ai, which implies that e/summationtextk
i=1ai·πi
q=±1. We obtain

. (1)
Now deﬁne
/a\}bracketle{tx/a\}bracketri}ht= min{x(modq), q−x(modq)}.
This is the residue of xmoduloqwhich has absolute value less than q/2. It will be useful to
note that /a\}bracketle{tx/a\}bracketri}ht=/a\}bracketle{ty/a\}bracketri}htimplies that x≡ ±y(modq). Thus, by observing thatπ/angbracketleftx/angbracketright
q<π
2and
sinπx
q=±sinπ/angbracketleftx/angbracketright
q, we can rewrite equation 1 as

i=1/parenleftbigg

We apply logarithms to both sides (we may take the principal b ranch of the logarithm) and get:

3Notice that for every i≤k, both/a\}bracketle{tai/a\}bracketri}htand/a\}bracketle{t2ai/a\}bracketri}htare co-prime with qand not greater thanq−1
2.
Thus, we may apply Theorem 2.2. and immediately get that M= 0. Using the notation of
Theorem 2.2.1, equation 3 can be written in the form
/summationdisplay
xi∈L1xi=/summationdisplay
yi∈L1yi.
ButL1is a linearly independent set. Hence every summand on the lef t-hand side of the equation
appears exactly the same amount of times at the right-hand si de. This means that we are able

2. We conclude
that/a\}bracketle{t2ai/a\}bracketri}ht=/a\}bracketle{tas/a\}bracketri}ht, which implies
as≡ ±2ai(modq).
Now there is a simple path to ﬁnish the proof: We relabel the el ements of A. We choose a1to
be an arbitrary element from Aand proceed by choosing ajto be the (unique) element such that
aj≡ ±2aj−1forj= 2,...,r . This is equivalent to
aj≡a1·(±2j−1) (mod q),1≤j≤r.
From this construction it is also evident that a1≡ ±2arsince2r≡1 (modq). We call this set
B1={a1,...,a r}={b1·(±2j−1)}with leader b1=a1. We can repeat the same construction
(to the multiset A\B1) and eventually we will exhaust all the elements of A. That settles the
theorem if qis a power of an odd prime.
We now focus on the second case. In order to not be too repetiti ve we only sketch brieﬂy
what modiﬁcations are to be made. We may repeat exactly the sa me arguments as long as
log/parenleftBig
2sin1·π
q/parenrightBig
does not emerge in any of the sides of equation 2. It is a routin e matter to see
that/a\}bracketle{tai/a\}bracketri}ht= 1only ifaiequals to 1orq−1. Also,/a\}bracketle{t2ai/a\}bracketri}ht= 1only ifaiequals toq−1
2orq+1
2. But
this is impossible, since from our assumption {1,q−1
2,q+1
2,q−1}∩A=∅. This completes the
proof.
Remark 1. For a moment, we take a brief look at the well-known trigonome tric identity4
2kcos(a)·cos(2a)···cos(2k−1a) =sin(2ka)
sina. (4)
One may ask if the angles must be in a geometric progression wi th ratio2in order to have equality
on both sides. In particular, we may consider the case where t here arekangles which are rational
multiples of πwith denominator q. Suppose that

Since2k≡1 (modq), this transposes to

.
As we have seen, this is possible only if all the ai’s belong to union of sets where each one
is a geometric progression with ratio ±2. Thus, as a corollary of our main theorem we see
(informally) that identity 4 holds true only for a “unique” c hoice of angles.
4This is often called “Morrie’s Law” [6].
6In the sequel we shall prove the following theorem, which can be regarded as the converse of
Theorem 2.3. Although we will eventually focus in the case wh ereqis a prime power, it is worth
mentioning that this result holds true for every odd number n.
Theorem 2.4. Letnbe odd and 2r≡1 (modn). Suppose that Ais a multiset with elements
fromZnand|A|=k. IfA=∪t
i=1Bi, whereBi={bi·(±2j−1) : 1≤j≤r}and/summationtext
a∈Aa≡0
(modn), the non-empty subset sums of Aare equally distributed modulo n.
Proof. We denote by S+the sum of all the elements from the sets B1,...,B twhich are of the
formbi(+2j−1)andS−the sum of all these which are of the form by bi(−2j−1). Additionally, let
Ambe the number of non-empty subset sums which are congruent to m(modn). For a moment,
we concentrate on the product
Px=/productdisplay
a∈A(1+ωx·a) = 1+n−1/summationdisplay
m=0Amωx·m. (5)
Hereω=e2πi/nis a primitive n-th root of unity. It is straightforward to see that for x= 0, we
haveP0= 2k. Forx≥1, sinceBi={bi·(±2j−1)}for1≤i≤t, we may write

But

j=1(1+ωx·bi·2j−1) =1−ωx·bi·2r
1−ωx·bi= 1,
since2r≡1 (modn)andωx·bi/\e}atio\slash= 1. Thus,
Px=ωx·S−, x≥1.
From equation 5, it is possible to obtain the inverse Fourier transform of {Am}n−1
m=0. From the
inverse transform formula, we obtain that for m≥1
Am=1

x=0Px·ω−x·m=1

x=1ωx·(S−−m)).
Ifm= 0,A0is equal to the same value minus 1since we adopt the convention that the empty

A0=−1+1
n(2k+n−1/summationdisplay
x=1ωx·(S−−m)).
We observe that/summationtextn−1
x=1ωx·(S−−m))is a sum of n−1terms who belong to a geometric progression.
It is well-known that

Putting this all together we see that for m/\e}atio\slash= 0,

Since/summationtext
a∈Aa≡0 (modn), we have S++S−≡0 (modn). Also, it is evident that S+−S−≡
0 (modn)since this is equivalent to
b1(1+21+...+2r−1)+...+bt(1+21+...+2r−1)≡0 (mod n).
This is obviously true because every summand is congruent to 0modulon. From this, we obtain
thatS+≡S−≡0 (modn). SinceS−≡0 (modn), we obtain A0=A1=...=An−1=
1
n(2k−1).
Remark 2. We pause now to record an observation that follows readily fr om the computations
made above. If we omit the restriction/summationtext
a∈Aa≡0 (modn), among the non-empty subset sums
equidistribution modulo noccurs except possibly for only two residue classes. In part icular, these
two residue classes differ from the others only by 1. This is somewhat surprising, since we may
multiply randomly by +2j−1or−2j−1every leader in B1,...,B tand still preserve rigid structure
among the subset sums of A.
3 Counting sets
Letqbe a power of an odd prime and rbe the order of 2moduloq. In this section, we will count
the number E(q)of sets with elements from Z×
q, having non-empty subset sums equidistributed
moduloq. From Theorem 2.1.3, Theorem2.3 and Theorem 2.4, this is pos sible if and only if Ais
a union of sets of the form
Bi={bi·(±2j−1) : 1≤j≤r},
such that/summationtext
a∈Aa≡0 (modq). This forces us to put some restraint in the way we deﬁne the
leadersbiand the choice of plus or minus, in order to have distinct elem ents which in addition
sum to0moduloq. For the reader’s convenience, we will shortly explain the g eneral strategy.
83.1 The number of possible leaders.
For the rest of the paper, we will denote the number of possibl e leaders with t. We begin by
making a construction similar to the one presented in Theore m 1.1. We choose the ﬁrst leader to
beb1= 1and deﬁne the i-th leader bias the least element in Z×
qwhich has the property that
bi/\e}atio\slash≡bκ(±2j−1) (mod q) :κ < i, j = 1,...,r.
In order to count the number of possible leaders, we have to tr eat separately the case where ris
odd or even. We recall that the number of elements of Z×
qisϕ(q).
Case 1. The order of 2moduloqis odd.
Ifris odd, for every possible choice of plus or minus the element s of{bi(±2j−1) :j=
1,...,r}are incogruent modulo q. To see this, suppose that bi(+2j−1)≡bi(+2w−1) (modq)
orbi(+2j−1)≡bi(−2w−1) (modq)for some j,w≤r. Since(bi,q) = 1 , the ﬁrst implies that
2j−w≡1 (modq)and the second that 2j−w≡ −1 (modq). We conclude that r|j−wor
r|2(j−w). Both are impossible, since j−wis less than randris odd. Thus, for all possible
choices of plus and minus, all numbers of the form bi(±2j−1)span2relements of Z×
q. From this
and the deﬁnition of bi, we obtain that there are t=ϕ(q)
2rpossible leaders.
Case 2. The order of 2moduloqis even.
Ifris even, from 2r≡1 (modq)we obtain (2r/2−1)(2r/2+1)≡0 (modq). But2r/2−1and
2r/2+ 1are coprime, since they are both consecutive odd numbers. It follows that q|2r/2−1,
orq|2r/2+ 1. Sinceris the order of 2moduloqwe must have 2r/2≡ −1 (modq). Hence,
bi·2j−1andbi(−2j−1+r/2)are congruent, which implies they cannot occur simultaneou sly in
Bi. In particular, both bi·2j−1andbi·2j−1+r/2must have the same sign in Bifor every j=
1,...,r/2. Thus, for all possible choices of plus and minus, all number s of the form bi(±2j−1)
spanrelements of Z×
q. From this and the deﬁnition of bi, we obtain that there are t=ϕ(q)
r
possible leaders.
Remark 3. From the previous analysis, the careful reader may notice th at every set
B={b·(±2j−1) : 1≤j≤r}is equal to some set Bi={bi·(±2j−1) : 1≤j≤r}. This
is trivially true if b=bi, for some leader bi. Ifbis not equal to any of the leaders, then from
deﬁnition we must have b≡bi(±2x−1) (modq)for some leader biand for some x≤r. Thus,
the set{b·(±2j−1) : 1≤j≤r}is equal to the set {bi·(±2x+j−2) : 1≤j≤r}. Since
{2n(modq) :n∈Z}is a cyclic group with order r, the last set is eventually equal to the set
Bi={bi·(±2j−1) : 1≤j≤r}.
3.2 The choice of “ +” and “−”.
What remains, is to count the number of ways we can choose plus or minus inside the sets Bi,
in order to ensure that/summationtext
a∈Aa≡0 (modq). Recall that in Theorem 2.4 we denoted by S+the
sum of all the elements from the sets Biwhich are of the form bi(+2j−1), byS−the sum of all
these which are of the form bi(−2j−1)and proved that S+≡S−≡0 (modq). Thus, it will be
enough to restrict ourselves to the choice of “ +”. We denote by S+
ithe sum of all the elements
9ofBiwhich are multiplied by +2j−1. Suppose Ais a union of τsets, that is, A=∪τ
i=1Bi. Thus,/summationtext
a∈Aa≡0 (modq)is equivalent to
τ/summationdisplay
i=1S+
i≡0 (mod q).
We observe that a choice of “ +” insideBi, corresponds to a sum of powers of 2all of which are
not greater than 2r−1. Every natural number has a unique binary representation, h ence a choice
of “+” corresponds to a unique value of S+
i. Thus,S+
ican take2rpossible values. (Note that we
want to take account the case where all the signs in Biare minus, which corresponds to S+
i= 0).
Hence,E(q)is equal to the number of solutions of the following congruen ce:

i=1bi·xi≡0 (mod q) : 0≤xi≤2r−1. (6)
Thereby, we introduce an elementary lemma which as we will se e, simpliﬁes the proof of The-
orem 3.2. In the following, b·xstands for the dot product of two vectors b= [b1,...,b s]and
x= [x1,...,x s], deﬁned by b·x=b1x1+...+bsxs. We will also use the term “ N- vector” for
a vector which has no repeated entries.
Lemma 3.1. SupposeB={b1,...,b t} ⊆Z×
qandX={0,1,2,...,kq},k∈N∗. LetH(n,b,x)
be the number of solutions of the congruence
b·x≡0 (mod q),
wherebis anN-vector with nentries from Bandxis a vector with nentries from X. Then
H(n,b,x) =1
q/parenleftbiggt
n/parenrightbigg
((kq+1)n+q−1).
Proof. It is sufﬁcient to count the number of possible choices of bi∈Bandxi∈Xsuch that
b1x1+...+bnxn≡0 (mod q).
First, we brieﬂy estimate the number of solutions of the cong ruenceb·x≡0 (modq)where
xi∈X\{0}. We will denote this by H∗(n,b,x). For a ﬁxed choice of b= [b1,...,b n], there are
(kq)n−1possible choices for x1,...,x n−1hence,(kq)n−1sums of the form b1x1+...+bn−1xn−1.
We observe that if
b1x1+...+bn−1xn−1≡β(modq),
then it sufﬁces to count the number of xn∈Xsuch that bnxn≡ −β(modq). Sincebn∈Z×
q
this is equivalent to xn≡ −βb−1
n(modq). We notice that in X\{0}every residue class appears
exactlykq
q=ktimes, therefore there are kpossible choices for xn. Thus, there are (kq)n−1·k=
(kq)n
qsolutions of the congruence b·x≡0 (modq). Since we can choose bin/parenleftbigt
n/parenrightbig
ways, we
conclude that
H∗(n,b,x) =/parenleftbiggt
n/parenrightbigg(kq)n
q.
10It sufﬁces to consider the case where xcontains some 0s. It is evident that if 0appearsm < n
times as an element of x, the number of solutions of b·x≡0 (modq)is equal to
H∗(n−m,b,x) =/parenleftbiggt
n/parenrightbigg(kq)n−m
q.
It is straightforward to see that 0can appear mtimes as an element of xin/parenleftbign
m/parenrightbig
possible ways.
Also, if all the entries of xare0, there are/parenleftbigt
n/parenrightbig
solutions to the congruence b·x≡0 (modq).
Thereby, we obtain
H(n,b,x) =/parenleftbiggt
n/parenrightbigg
+n−1/summationdisplay
m=0/parenleftbiggn
m/parenrightbigg
H∗(n−m,b,x).
If we substitute H∗(n−m,b,x)from above this is equal to

Using the binomial theorem we see that/summationtextn

(kq)n−m= (kq+1)n. Therefore, we proved
that
H(n,b,x) =1

((kq+1)n+q−1).
With these auxiliary computations in place, we are now ready to prove our last result.
Theorem 3.2. For an odd prime power q, letE(q)be the number of sets A⊆Z×
qhaving non-
empty subset sums equidistributed (modq). Then
E(q) =

−1+1

ifr≡1 (mod 2)
(2r/2+1)ϕ(q)/r−1 ifr≡0 (mod 2) .
Proof. It is evident that in Lemma 3.1 we count the number of solution s of congruence 6,with
kq=2r−1
q, if all leaders biare different. However, it is possible that Ais a union of sets with the
same leader.
Case 1. The order of 2moduloqis odd.
Observe that for every possible choice of “ +” or “−”, ifBiandBi′have the same leader then
Bi∪Bi′={bi·(−2j−1)}∪{bi·(+2j−1)}: 1≤j≤r.
From this, it is evident that the same leader may appear only t wice and the sum of the elements
ofBi∪Bi′is0moduloq. Therefore, it does not affect the condition/summationtext
a∈Aa≡0 (modq). We
estimateE(q), by focusing on the possible number of pairs of equal leaders . Suppose a union
containsvpairs of sets with equal leaders for v= 0,...,t andzsets with different leaders for
z= 0,...,t−v. Notice that the case v=z= 0will be excluded at the end, since it represents
11the empty union, hence the empty set. For zdifferent leaders we may apply Lemma 3.1 with
t=t−v,n=z,kq= 2r−1and obtain the value
1
q/parenleftbiggt−v
z/parenrightbigg
((2r)z+q−1).
However, there are/parenleftbigt
v/parenrightbig
ways to obtain vpairs of equal leaders. Thus,
E(q) =−1+t/summationdisplay
v=0/parenleftbiggt
v/parenrightbiggt−v/summationdisplay
z=01
q/parenleftbiggt−v
z/parenrightbigg
((2r)z+q−1).
From the binomial theorem, we see that
t−v/summationdisplay
z=01
q/parenleftbiggt−v
z/parenrightbigg
((2r)z+q−1) =1
q/parenleftbig
(2r+1)t−v+(q−1)·2t−v/parenrightbig
.
This yields
E(q) =−1+t/summationdisplay
v=0/parenleftbiggt
v/parenrightbigg1
q/parenleftbig
(2r+1)t−v+(q−1)·2t−v/parenrightbig
which again, by the binomial theorem is equal to
−1+1
q/parenleftbig
(2r+2)t+(q−1)·3t/parenrightbig
.
Since the number of leaders is t=ϕ(q)
2r, we obtain
E(q) =−1+1
q/parenleftbig
(2r+2)ϕ(q)/2r+(q−1)·3ϕ(q)/2r/parenrightbig
.
Case 2. The order of 2moduloqis even.
Recall that from the previous analysis if ris even, both bi·2j−1andbi·2j−1+r/2must have the
same sign in Bifor every j= 1,...,r/2, since2r/2≡ −1 (modq). This implies that the sum
of the elements of Bi(and thus, of A) give a sum equal to 0 (modq)and that no pair of equal
leaders appears. Hence, the number of possible choices for “ +” inBiis equal to the number of
positive integers which have a binary representation consi sting of powers of 2not greater than
2r/2−1. This number is 2r/2. (Again, we want to take account the case where all signs are “ −”,
which corresponds to S+
i= 0). Forzdifferent leaders, there are (2r/2)zchoices of “ +” and/parenleftbigt
z/parenrightbig
ways to choose the leaders. Thus, there are/parenleftbigt
z/parenrightbig
(2r/2)zpossible unions. Hence,
E(q) =t/summationdisplay
z=1/parenleftbiggt
z/parenrightbigg
(2r/2)z.
From the binomial theorem, this is equal to (2r/2+ 1)t−1. Since in this case, t=ϕ(q)/r, we
obtain that
E(q) = (2r/2+1)ϕ(q)/r−1.
This completes the proof and the paper.
