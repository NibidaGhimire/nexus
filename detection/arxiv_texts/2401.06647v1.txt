Abstract
Superlattices are materials created by the alternating growth of two chemically different mate-
rials. The direct consequence of creating a superlattice is the folding of the Brillouin zone which
gives rise to additional electronic bands and phonon modes. This has been successfully exploited to
achieve new transport and optical properties in semiconductor superlattices, for example. Here, we
show that multiferroic BiFeO 3/LaFeO 3superlattices are more than just periodic chemical stack-
ing. Using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and first-principles calculations,
we demonstrate the existence of a new order of FeO 6octahedra, with a period along the growth
direction about twice that of the chemical supercell, i.e. a superorder. The effect of this new
structural order on the lattice dynamics is studied with ultrafast optical pump-probe experiments.
While a mode at 1.2 THz is attributed solely to the chemical modulation of the superlattice, the
existence of another 0.7 THz mode seems to be explained only by a double Brillouin zone folding
in agreement with the structural description. Our work shows that multiferroic BiFeO 3/LaFeO 3
superlattices can be used to tune the spectrum of coherent THz phonons, and potentially that of
magnons or electromagnons.

2INTRODUCTION
Superlattices are artificial structures in which the periodic sequence of nanolayers de-
fines a chemical super-order. These superlattices offer a rich playground to confine particles
and quasi-particles. Through the control of the Brillouin zone-folding process it permits
to tailor quantum-well electronic wavefunctions [1] and folded-THz acoustic phonon spec-
trum [2, 4, 5, 7‚Äì10]. This phonon and electron band engineering in superlattices has been
successfully managed with semiconductors and has led to important technological devel-
opments like the quantum cascade laser [3] and more recently the emergence of phonon
lasers [11]. Beyond semiconductors, oxides play a particular role because of the plethora of
functionalities already employed in devices and sensors, but also because there exists the
recent capability in growing high quality oxide superlattices [12‚Äì19]. Due to the existence
of multiple couplings such as (anti)ferroelectricity, (anti)ferromagnetism and ferroelastic-
ity, the oxide superlattices exhibit more than the periodic sequence of a chemical order,
unlike semiconductors. For instance, it has been revealed recently in PbTiO 3-SrTiO 3su-
perlattices the existence of vortices [13, 14, 23], and ferroelectric multidomains structures
in oxide superlattices which, for instance, play a central role for the negative capacitance
effect [24]. Room temperature multiferroic BiFeO 3-based superlattices have been also grown
only recently [18, 19] and reveal the existence of new polar and structural orders like anti-
ferroelectric order and structural/polar orders that are incommensurate with the chemical
superlattice parameter [20‚Äì22]. The short and long-range structural order, arising from the
intrinsic confinement in the superlattice and the competition between interfacial stress and
electrostatic boundaries, have been already studied by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy
and piezoelectric measurements [12‚Äì14, 18‚Äì22].
In this work, by analysing electron and X-ray diffraction patterns, we reveal the existence
of rich multiple structural orders in a BiFeO 3/LaFeO 3(BFO/LFO) superlattice. We show
that besides the known in-plane orthorhombic distortion and antiferroelectric-like order [18,
19], a long-range out-of-plane super-order is revealed. We evidence a supercell parameter
which approaches the double ( ‚àº2Œõ) of the chemical superlattice parameter. The latter one
(Œõ) being solely defined by the thickness of the double layer BFO/LFO. On the basis of a
first principle calculation, we assign this new order to a specific sequence of FeO 6octahebra
tilt that makes two adjacent BFO layers non-equivalent. We arrive then to a super-period
3BFO(1)/LFO/BFO(2)/LFO corresponding to a structural period of ‚àº2Œõ. We then discuss
how such super-order can affect the THz acoustic phonon spectrum of the superlattice.
For this purpose, we performed time-resolved optical pump-probe experiments. We show
that with these BiFeO 3/LaFeO 3superlattices it is indeed possible to optically generate and
detect at room temperature a 1.2 THz longitudinal coherent acoustic phonon mode which is
consistent with mode-folded phonons arising from the chemical order. Such a folded mode
was already revealed in different oxide superlattices like in Pb(Zr,T)O 3-SrRuO 3[15, 16] and
BaTiO 3-SrTiO 3[17] superlattices. More interestingly, we detect a new mode centered at
0.7 THz which cannot be explained by taking into account solely the superlattice chemical
order. We attribute this new mode to a secondary mode-folding process in agreement with
the existence of a nearly double super-cell revealed by the structural analysis. These finding
opens new avenue to tailor the spectrum of particles (electron, phonon, electromagnon) in
multiferroic superlattices with a controllable mode-folding.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Growth and structural analysis
The BiFeO 3/LaFeO 3superlattice has been grown with Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD)
and details can be found in Methods. On total, 15 bilayers (BFO/LFO) have been grown for
a superlattice thickness of around 60 nm. The superlattice has been studied with electron
and X-ray diffraction methods combined with Transmission Electron Microsocopy-TEM
imaging (see Methods). A High Angle Annular Dark Field Scanning Transmission Electron
Microscopy image (HAADF-STEM) is presented in Fig. 1a where the chemical supercell
parameter Œõ = dBiFeO 3+dLaFeO 3is shown with dBiFeO 3anddLaFeO 3being the corresponding
layer thicknesses. It is worth noting first that the sample does not show major stacking-
faults or dislocations. The sequence of the chemical order (Bi, Fe, La) is presented in
Fig. 1b where we can see a slight diffusion at the interface. Figure 1c presents the X-ray
diffraction pattern in Œ∏/2Œ∏geometry for the BFO/LFO SL for the first order of diffraction
corresponding to a scanning of the reciprocal space along [00 Œæ]*(see Methods). Intense,
sharp and regularly spaced satellite peaks are observed which demonstrate a true chemical
modulation of the stacking and not a solid solution. Finite-size fringes in between the

satellites are also observed further highlighting the excellent structural quality of the SL. In
order to get access to the out-of-plane lattice parameters of the BFO and LFO layers and
the number of BFO and LFO unit cells, this pattern has been simulated with the Matlab
Interactive XRDfit program [25] (blue curve in Fig. 1c). This semi- kinematical approach
allows a fast simulation by adjusting the number of unit cells and the out-of-plane lattice
parameters in each layer (BFO and LFO) of the period Œõ (Note that it does not take into
account interdiffusion, strain gradient and domains). BFO and LFO number of unit cells
used for the simulation are 6 and 5 with a lattice parameter of 0.4 nm and 0.3925 nm,
respectively. The out-of-plane lattice parameters are in agreement with an overall in-plane
compressive strain for a coherent growth. Note that a structure BFO(5)/LFO(6) also gives
a reasonable fit indicating that there is at the macroscopic level a fluctuation of the number
of the layers with then Œõ ‚àº11a, where ais the average pseudo-cubic lattice parameter

order (Œõ) and from the additional super-order ( ‚àº2Œõ).
Very importantly, while Fig. 1c is sensitive to the average unit cell and superlattice (Œõ)
parameters in the [00 Œæ]* direction only, electron and X-ray diffraction measurements in
the extended reciprocal space presented in Fig. 2a-b and HRTEM images shown in Fig. 2c-e
acquired in different regions, reveal that a more complex short and long-range atomic and/or
polar arrangements are present. The electron diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 2a (top left
6panel) shows first the in-plane unit-cell doubling with Bragg peak at (1
200) consistently with
Pnma (Pbnm) structure already reported in the literature [18, 19]. The chemical supercell
parameter (Œõ) is evidenced along the [00 Œæ]* reciprocal space direction as revealed by the
corresponding profile of electron diffraction intensity. An example of the profile of one
of these Bragg peak intensities (the selected one is located by the red arrow in the top
left panel) is shown by the red curve in the top right panel of Fig. 2a. The observation
of the super-structure (Œõ ‚àºNa) is consistent with the chemical superstructure revealed
by X-ray diffraction in Fig. 1c. Importantly, when scrutinizing the Bragg peak around
the position (1 +1
20Œæ), located by the blue arrow in the top left panel of Fig. 2a, two
satellites are evidenced at around (1
20¬±1
2N). The intensity profiles of these additional super-
structures ( ‚àº2Œõ = 2 Na) are shown in Fig. 2a (blue curve in the top right panel). With
these measurements, a numerical estimate gives Œõ ‚àºNa= 11 .2aconsistently with the
value deduced from the fit of the X-ray diffraction (see Fig. 1c). These satellites (1
20¬±1
2N)
demonstrate the existence of a super-order whose periodicity ( ‚àº2Œõ) is around twice that
of the chemical order. This super-order ‚àº2Œõ is also observed in X-ray diffraction with the
two satellites (1
20 1¬±1
2N) shown in Fig. 2b where a fit of these satellites position gives a
characteristic length of 2Œõ ‚âà21.1a.
High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images shown in Fig. 2c
reveal that there are statistically two regions (that we can roughly separate by a white
dashed line in Fig. 2c) with different orders. The central region is the so-called conventional
one (no super-order) while the two others (in the left and right parts of Fig. 2c) are the
‚Äùunconventional ones‚Äù (with super-order 2Œõ). An analysis at a larger scale indicates that
these two regions are statistically distributed in the superlattice and these regions have a
typical size of 20 nm. A 2D Fast Fourier Transform Image (Fig. 2d) perfectly confirms the
observations made with the electron and X-ray diffraction measurements. The nearly double
superlattice period ( ‚âà2Œõ) is revealed only along the reciprocal space direction [1
20Œæ]*. Even
if the intensity is smaller and more diffuse, we also detect split Bragg reflections around
the position (1
400). This indicates an anti-ferroelectric PbZrO 3-like structure consistently
with previous reports [18, 19]. The intensity profiles shown in Fig. 2e confirm the two
characteristic lengths ‚àºŒõ and ‚àº2Œõ. It is remarkable to note that the new super-order
(‚àº2Œõ) is detectable only along the [1
20Œæ]* direction while the so-called chemical super-order
is evidenced along [00 Œæ]*. This means that only the regions which exhibit the associated
7the Pnma (Pbnm) symmetry at the unit cell level, i.e. a doubling of the unit cell in the
in-plane direction, also exhibit this new out-of-plane super-order. When focusing in the
real space (see inset of Fig. 2c), we can see that in the super-ordered region, there is an
intensity modulation of the electron diffraction image in the BiFeO 3layer that alternates
in the plane of the layer (bright-dark Bi columns). Very interestingly, this sequence also
exists in the adjacent BFO layer but is in anti-phase as perfectly revealed in the light blue
rectangle in the inset of Fig. 2c. This intensity modulation in the real space is consistent
with our description of a double super-cell parameter. A closer look on displacement of the

of BFO (Bi atomes in purple) and LFO (La atoms in green) having 3 unit cells.
Bismuth atoms (Fig. 3a) in the ‚Äùunconventionnal region‚Äù has also been made in the BFO
layers with High-Angle Annular Dark-Field images (HAADF-STEM). In the BFO layer,
8there is a well structured organization of this displacement. Some Bismuth atoms exhibit a
vertical displacement and in between some of them rather exhibit an oblique displacement,
that is either left or right oriented. It is worth mentioning that the apparent displacement
of the Bismuth atoms (vertical or oblique) is a consequence of a projection of displacement
of several Bismuth atoms in the atomic column between the top and bottom surfaces of
the TEM lamella. This leads to an elliptical distortion of the projected Bismuth atomic
column as previously discussed [19]. The important new element we report is the anti-phase
organization of this displacement for two adjacent BFO layers that explains the existence
of a supercell parameter ‚àº2Œõ. This effect can be observed in the work of Mundy et al [19]
but has not been discussed so far.
Modeling of the superlattice structure
In order to further delve into the origin of the doubling of the supercell, we calculated
the phonon dispersion in high-symmetry, ‚Äùcubic-like‚Äù BFO n/LFO n(n= 1,2,3) superlat-
tices using Density Functional Perturbation Theory (See also Supplementary Note 2). Such
approach yields imaginary phonon modes (represented as negative in figure 3b), which are
hallmarks of atomistic distortions that develop to form the real ground state order of these
superlattices. Interestingly, the most unstable phonon frequency are found at the point
A= (1/2,1/2,1/4n) and M= (1/2,1/2,0) in pseudocubic reciprocal lattice notation. In
particular, for the largest superlattices investigated ( n= 3), the AandMinstabilities al-
most have the same imaginary frequency. If such features were to persist at n= 6, it would
explain why we observe two regions, corresponding to a separate condensation of the two
modes. In such a case, the ‚Äùconventional‚Äù region could be attributed primarily to the con-
densation of the Mphonon mode (region without super-orders), while the unconventional
region with 1 /24 modulation would be very well explained as resulting from the condensa-
tion of the Aphonon instability (region with super-orders). The associated soft-modes with
the corresponding sequence of FeO 6octahedra tilts (using Glazer‚Äôs notation [27]) in the out-
of-plane direction are shown in Fig. 3c. Similar octahedra tilts sequences were theoretically
predicted in bulk materials as a possible new orders in perovskite oxides [28, 29] and we very
likely provide the first experimental evidence of existence of these orders in BiFeO 3/LaFeO 3
superlattices.
9Coherent phonon dynamics
These rich structural super-orders are a perfect demonstration that in such a BFO-LFO
superlattice, additionally to the chemical order i.e. the sequence of the BFO and LFO layer,
there is an additional long-range structural order ( ‚âà2Œõ). Such nearly double supercell might
have an important consequence on the spectrum of THz coherent acoustic phonons as dis-
cussed in the following. To support it, we have investigated the generation and detection of
coherent acoustic phonon following an ultrafast optical pump-probe method (Fig. 4a). This
technique has been previously employed to study the coherent acoustic phonons in bulk
BiFeO 3for instance [30‚Äì33]. The pump beam, with photon energy above BFO and LFO
electronic band gaps, is absorbed and generate acoustic phonons propagating only along
[001] direction (see Methods). The time-delayed probe beam, with photon energy below
these electronic band gaps, is back-scattered by the propagating photoexcited phonons (see
Methods). The analysis of the transient optical reflectivity permits to reveal these coherent
acoustic phonons through characteristic Brillouin oscillations (time-domain Brillouin spec-
troscopy). Since the detection of the coherent acoustic phonons is realized in the reflection
geometry (back-scattering) and with a normal incidence, due to the momentum conserva-
tion, the coherent acoustic phonons that are detected in the Brillouin process are those at a
wave vector two times that of the probe beam, with q= 2kprobe. Since the probe wavelength
Œªis much larger that the lattice aand superlattice Œõ parameters, the detection takes place
very close to the Brillouin zone center (ZC), i.e. with q‚àº0.
The typical signal shown in Fig. 4b is composed of a fast rise of the transient optical
reflectivity signal corresponding to the electronic excitation of the BFO-LFO system. Then
a plateau-like response is observed (long-lifetime of photoexcited carriers and thermal effect)
on which oscillatory signals are revealed due to the Brillouin process [30‚Äì33]. The first
detected period over a long time delay up to 80 ps is around 12 ps corresponding to a
Brillouin frequency of 60 GHz. It is important to have in mind that with a sound velocity
in BFO of around 5000 m.s‚àí1[30‚Äì33] and quite similar for LFO [44], after typically 10 ps
the photogenerated acoustic phonon has left the superlattice. This means that the Brillouin
signal at 60 GHz come from the detection of acoustic phonon in STO. That frequency
is perfectly consistent with the theoretical value fSTO = 2nSTOVSTO/Œª=63GHz , where
nSTO= 2.4 and vSTO‚âà8300 m.s‚àí1are the refractive index and the longitudinal sound

velocity in STO [37]. More interestingly, within the first tens of picoseconds (inset of Fig. 4b),
we reveal oscillatory components having much higher frequencies with periods of a couple of
picoseconds. A zoom on this acoustic phonon signal is given in Fig. 4c for a probe wavelength
of 587nm. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) given in Fig. 4d reveals mainly two modes
with f1=0.7 THz and f2=1.2 THz. A simple simulation of this signal ( S(t)) reproduces
quite well the experimental observations as shown in Fig. 4c with S(t) = ( A1cos(w1t) +
A2cos(w2t))e‚àít/2ps, considering w1= 2œÄf1andw2= 2œÄf2. The damping time of 2 ps has
been chosen consistently with the lifetime observed experimentally. The amplitude has been
taken as A2= 1.15A1and the phase is zero for both modes. As discussed in the following, the
detected THz acoustic phonons come actually from the BFO-LFO superlattice. Detecting
THz acoustic phonon in superlattices with supercell parameter of few nanometers is indeed
11expected due to the mode folding mechanism several times discussed in the literature for
semiconductors and oxides [2, 4, 5, 7‚Äì10, 15‚Äì17]. It is however the first ever reported coherent
THz acoustic phonon generated and detected in BiFeO 3-based superlattice. With a set of
elastic properties of BFO and LFO (either calculated or extracted from the bulk system, See
Supplementary Note 2), it is possible to analytically calculate the phonon dispersion curve
œâ=f(q) for longitudinal acoustic phonon propagating along the out-of-plane direction and
for the superlattice period Œõ = dBFO+dLFO = 12 a. The dispersion curve is shown in
Fig. 4e where we see the mode folding of the LA mode in this BFO-LFO superlattice with
the Brillouin zone edge vector œÄ/Œõ. In that case, the region indicated by the red arrows
(Fig. 4e) are the ones where some coherent acoustic phonon are expected to be detected
according to the aforementioned selection rule ( q= 2 kprobe ‚âà0). At the very low
frequency ( <100 GHz) a Brillouin mode is expected to be detected in the SL (similarly to
the one observed in STO) but is not since its characteristic period of oscillation (typically
the one observed for STO) is longer than the time of flight of the acoustic phonons in the
SL. More importantly, there is a second region ( œâZC) where modes can be detected and
values of around 1.1-1.2 THz are expected. These frequency are actually consistent with
the detected mode f2with œâZC/2œÄ‚àºf2. Such œâZCzone centered mode coming from the
mode folding governed by the periodic chemical composition BFO-LFO (Œõ) is the typical
one that is conventionally observed in the coherent phonon spectra of many semiconductor
[2, 4, 5, 7‚Äì10] and ferroelectric [15‚Äì17] superlattices. Very importantly, we show that the
mode f1=0.75 THz cannot be explained by the conventional mode folding driven by the
chemical super-order. In the theoretical calculation, a mode in the region 0.5-0.7 THz is
predicted, but it is a zone edge mode ( œâZE), thus not detected according to the optical
detection selection rule. We discuss in the following the origin of this mode.
It is first worth mentioning that magnon mode at 0.7 THz has already been reported
in BiFeO 3nanostructures [26] arising from a magnon mode folding caused by the magnetic
cycloid. Such a mode can be excluded in our case since we have a confined and strained
multiferroic nanostructure where the cycloid is no more present as discussed in the litera-
ture [26]. We have confirmed the absence of the cycloid with polarized neutron diffraction
in a BFO(12)/LFO(12) superlattice (see Supplementary Note 3).
The origin of this mode at 0.7 THz might have another origin. Different hypothesis can
be discussed. First of all, one could envision also a shear acoustic mode folding. Considering
12the shear velocity of around 3000 m.s‚àí1[30, 33, 38, 39], one can expect a zone center mode at
around 0.7 THz (calculation not shown). But, generating a shear acoustic phonon requires
that the system has the proper symmetry, i.e. that an in-plane symmetry breaking exists
(i.e. absence of a symmetry plane perpendicular to the surface). This condition is fulfilled
in the bulk single-domain BiFeO 3, with rhombohedral symmetry (3 m) [30, 33, 38] or in
single domain monoclinic BiFeO 3thin film [39]. This in-plane symmetry breaking is usually
well correlated with optical birefringence in both aformentioned cases as a witness of crystal
anisotropy [30, 33, 39]. Such optical birefringence is absent in the BFO/LFO superlattice
(see Supplementary Note 4). This is an indication, that at the level of an optical beam focus,
the BFO/LFO superlattice is isotropic. This is consistent with the microscopic organisation
revealed by electron microscopy where we see the coexistence of so-called conventional and
non-conventional regions (see discussion in Structural analysis Section). We do not have a
single domain ferroelectric/multiferroic structure in our superlattice. Even if at the level of
the unit cell, light can generate shear acoustic waves, the multidomain state might lead to an
average effect at the macroscopic level. So we think then that we can exclude that the mode
at 0.7 THz comes from the generation and detection of coherent transverse mode. Secondly,
we have also to consider that the mode at 0.7 THz could be a localized surface mode
as revealed in Mo/Si superlattice for example [40]. Such localized mode usually appears
in superlattices having a wide forbidden phonon band gap due to a very large acoustic
impedance mismatch between the layers and terminated with the lower acoustic impedance
layer [40]. In our case, the top layer LaFeO 3has a lower acoustic impedance than BiFeO 3(see
Supplementary Note 2) but the forbidden band gap is much smaller than the one observed
in Mo/Si layer and our mode at 0.7 THz does not fall into the phonon bandgap. As a
consequence, at the moment, it is difficult to assign the mode 0.7 THz to a localized mode.
Finally, we think that a plausible interpretation could rely on the new super-ordered we
reveal in this superlattice. With an out-of-plane period that is around 2Œõ (see Fig. 2), such
a double superlattice period should lead to a second mode folding. In that case, this will
transfer the ZE mode at the ZC position. Consequently, the so-called ZE mode would be
optically detectable. When looking at the theoretical (0.5-0.7 THz) and experimental (0.7
THz) values, we see that the agreement is not perfect in our case but could be explained by
the possible departure of the elastic parameters of bulk materials used in this calculation.
We have also to underline that the value of the double super-period 2Œõ is not perfectly an
13integer a, since we extract a value of 21.1a in X-ray diffraction (Fig. 2b). This indicates that
we cannot completely exclude incommensurate superorders [20‚Äì22] that would contribute to
a departure from a perfect double mode folding. Even if this disorder might exist, the long
range order (2Œõ) remains strong to be clearly revealed by electron and X-ray diffraction.
Such double mode folding open very interesting perspectives for engineering the spectrum
of phonons and other particles in multiferroic superlattices in the future.
SUMMARY
To summarize, in this work we have scrutinized the structural properties and coherent
acoustic phonon dynamics in BiFeO 3-LaFeO 3based superlattices with a combination of
electron and X-ray diffraction, optical time-resolved pump-probe method and modeling.
Besides the Pnma distorsion and the anti-ferroelectric orders visible at the unit cell, we
show the existence of a long-range interaction whose characteristic length is at least twice
the chemical supercell parameter (made of a bilayer BFO-LFO). Simulations based on DFT
calculations support the existence of non-equivalent neighbor BFO layers that leads to the
doubling of the superlattice parameter. Such doubling is due to the fact that both the polar
order and the sequence of the oxygen octahedra tilts in the out-of-plane direction do not
follow the chemical order. Rather, the pattern of the octahedra tilts scales with the double
of the chemical supercell. We have evaluated the impact of this new crystallographic order
on the lattice dynamics with time-resolved pump-probe experiments. We demonstrate that
in this superlattice it is possible to generate coherent THz acoustic phonons (1.2 THz, 0.7
THz), never reported so far. While the mode at 1.2 THz is correlated to the chemical
supercell, the detected mode at 0.7 THz seems to be connected to the newly created
FeO 6octahedra superorder. These results demonstrate that multiferroic superlattices are
more than a stacking of chemically different layers. These findings enable to envision in
the future to tailor the electron, phonon, magnon or electromagnon spectra in the THz range.
Experimental Section
Sample preparation
BFO/LFO superlattices (SLs) were grown directly on Niobium doped (0.5 at%) (001)-
oriented SrTiO 3substrates by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) using a KrF excimer laser
14(wavelength 248 nm). A stoichiometric homemade ceramic target of LaFeO 3was used
whereas an extra and usual amount of 10% Bi was introduced to the homemade BiFeO 3
target to compensate bismuth volatility. The SLs were grown at 3Hz pulse frequency, a
fluence of 1.8 J/cm2, a temperature of 775‚ó¶C and oxygen pressure of 0.2 mbar. These opti-
mized growth conditions were obtained from single BFO and LFO thin films synthesis. A
low deposition rate was obtained for both compounds enabling a good control on the amount
of deposited matter (53 laser shots to complete one unit cell for BFO and 73 laser shots for
LFO).
The multiferroic BiFeO 3/LaFeO 3superlattice have been grown on Niobium doped
(0.5at%) SrTiO3 substrate by pulsed laser deposition (excimer KrF : 248nm) at 3Hz pulse
frequency, a fluence of 1.8J/cm2, 725‚ó¶Cand oxygen pressure of 0.2mbar. Details of the
growth parameters can be found in Ref. [18]. Contrary to the previous work on BFO-LFO
superlattice [18], no buffer layer was used. In complement to the Fig. 1c, the coherent
growth is also verified through reciprocal space mapping around the (103) family of planes
(not shown).
Electron microscopy
TEM cross-sectional lamella preparation was performed in a FEI Helios 660 FIB-SEM.
Observation was carried out in two microscopes: High Resolution Scanning Transmission
Electron Microscopy (HRSTEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) were
obtained in a FEI Titan3 60-300, operated at 300kV, while Electron Diffraction (ED) and
High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) were obtained in a JEOL
2010F, operating at 200kV. The analysis of the atomic lattice (atomic column position and
shape) was carried out using Atomap software.
X-ray diffraction
Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data were collected at the CRISTAL beamline of SOLEIL
Synchrotron (Saint Aubin, France). The X-ray photon energy was set to 7.064 keV using a
Si(111) double crystal monochromator, harmonic rejection being ensured by two reflections
on Si mirrors. The diffraction signal was recorded with the 2D detector ImXPAD-S540
placed at a distance of 818.5 mm from sample position. The Œ∏-2Œ∏¬∏ scan presented in Figure
1c was obtained by summing diffracted intensities over a region of interest of 20 x 20 pixels
(2.6 mm √ó2.6 mm). The reciprocal space map shown in Figure 2b was calculated using
the BINoculars software, from an angular scan performed in grazing incidence geometry.
15The incidence angle of the X-ray beam was fixed to 1‚ó¶with respect to the (001) surface
plane, resulting in an X-ray footprint of 1.7 mm √ó0.5 mm on the sample. The diffraction
condition was tuned by rotating the sample about its surface normal, with the detector set
to the relevant elevation and azimuthal angles.
Modelling
DFT calculation : We performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations using the
plane-wave VASP software package. We used the PBEsol exchange and correlation func-
tional and + Ucorrection. Details of the calculations will be found in the Supplementary
Note 1.
Time-resolved pump-probe experiment
A Ti:sapphire laser delivering laser pulses with 140fs duration at 800 nm is separated in two
arms. A first one is doubled in energy in a Baryum BetaBorate crystal (BBO) according
to the second harmonic generation process (SHG). This near-UV beam is used as a pump
beam and has photon energy (3.1eV) larger than both the BFO [34] and LFO materials [35]
bandgaps. Consequently the light is absorbed in the superlattice and not in STO having
a larger band gap (3.3eV). The second 800 nm laser beam synchronously pump an optical
parametric oscillator delivering visible light pulses at 580 nm (below band gap detection),
to detect the phonon in the entire structure (superlattice and the STO substrate). Since
the probe beam is below the band gap of BiFeO 3and LaFeO 3, the detection mainly reveals
the so-called Brillouin mode and more details about time-resolved Brillouin will be found
in previous works [30‚Äì33]. A sketch of the experiment is shown in Fig. 4a. Since the
pump and probe beam foot print are much larger than the typical propagation distance of
detected phonon ( <1¬µm), the generation of strain has a piston-like shape, i.e. we have a
1D geometry and the phonon propagate perpendicularly to the irradiated surface (i.e. along
the [001] direction). It is worth to note that Raman scattering was not possible due to
the detrimental contribution of the STO substrate and that limitation is prevented with
coherent phonon dynamics investigated with pump-probe methods since coherent phonon
are generated in the SL only. More details on the experimental methods can be found in
our previous works [30‚Äì33].
16SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 1: DFT CALCULATION
We performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations using the plane-wave VASP
software package. We used the PBEsol exchange and correlation functional and + Ucor-
rection. The Hubbard Uis 4 eV on Fe- dstates and 2 eV on La- fstates. The exchange
parameter Jwas set to 0. The calculation was performed with a 9 √ó9√ó9 Monkhorst-
Pack k-mesh and a 500 eV plane-wave cutoff. The magnetic order was set to G-type AFM
collinear spin in the BFO/LFO superlattices. We started from the high symmetry, cubic-
like structure to see the instabilities in the phonon dispersion at 0 K. We built 1/1, 2/2,
3/3 BFO/LFO superlattices, fixing all atoms in their ideal cubic position and only relaxing
along the c lattice direction. All configurations are obtained with P4/mmm symmetry. The
phonon calculations are based on the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) with
the help of PHONOPY code. The force constant matrix was calculated with a 2 √ó2√ó2 su-
percell which contains 80, 160, and 240 atoms respectively. In Figure 5, we show the phonon
spectra for the cubic-like phase of 1/1, 2/2 and 3/3 BFO/LFO SLs. Major instabilities can
be observed at the MandApoint. These correspond, respectively, to (1 /2,1/2,0) and
(1/2,1/2,1/2) reciprocal wavevectors of the BFO n/LFO nSLs. Since the SL is made of 2 n
perosvkite layers in the third direction, the Apoint actually corresponds to a 4 nmodulation
in terms of the perovskite unit cell, i.e.A= (1/2,1/2,1/4n) in the perovskite pseudocu-
bic notation. In particular, this Acorresponds to tilt with a modulation that doubles the
chemical lattice constant.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 2: ANALYTICAL CALCULATION OF PHONON DIS-
PERSION CURVE
We have considered the standard equation to calculate the phonon dispersion curve œâ=
f(q)[2, 4‚Äì10, 15‚Äì17]. For a superlattice composed of an alternating BFO and LFO layer,
and for phonon propagating along the out-plane direction, i.e. perpendicular to the layers,
the relation dispersion is :
cos(qŒõ) = cos(œâdBFO
VBFO)cos(œâdLFO
VLFO)‚àí1
2(ZBFO
ZLFO+ZLFO
ZBFO)sin(œâdBFO
VBFO)sin(œâdLFO
VLFO)
œâandqare the phonon pulsation and the wave vector, respectively. The superlattice
period is Œõ = dBFO+dLFO, and ZBFO =œÅBFOVBFO andZLFO =œÅLFOVLFO are the
acoustic impedance of each layer with œÅBFO,œÅLFO,VBFO andVLFOthe mass density and
the longitudinal sound velocity of BFO and LFO, respectively.
This equation can only be solved by numerical calculation. To plot the dispersion curve
shown in Fig. 4d in the main manuscript, we have taken the following values that per-
mit to reproduce the zone center (ZC) mode detected at ‚àº1.15 THz : œÅBFO=8220 kg.m‚àí3,
œÅLFO=6400 kg.m‚àí3,VBFO=5000 m.s‚àí1[38, 43]and VLFO=4500 m.s‚àí1[44]. We have consid-
ereddBFO=dLFO=0.39√ó5.5 nm.
SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 3: POLARIZED NEUTRON DIFFRACTION

ter WISH [41] located at the second target station of the ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon

Source, United Kingdom. By nature, neutron diffraction allows the average structure of the
whole superlattice (and the substrate) to be measured. The experimental setup used was
similar to our previous work on BiFeO 3thin films [42] (Fig. 6a) but with higher spatial in-
strumental resolution (divergence 0.17‚ó¶instead of 0.25‚ó¶) to allow better detection of possible
peak splitting. The superlattice under investigation has a BFO and LFO layers twice thicker
than the superlattice discussed in the main text. This permits to enhance the neutron sig-
nal. Despite the fact that the structure appears antiferromagnetic, implying BiFeO3 should
therefore not host a cycloid, we collected neutron diffraction data for two different rotations.
Both datasets show no peak splitting either spatially or in d-spacing (along the time of flight
direction) as shown in Fig. 6b but instead reveal a single sharp peak for each orientation
at the exact same d-spacing. The results are consistent with a simple G-type antiferromag-
netic structure with a propagation vector [1
21

2] in cubic setting. This is in contrast to our
previous measurements on thin films of BiFeO 3grown on orthorhombic DyScO 3substrate
where clear peak splitting was observed spatially and in d-spacing [42], corresponding to
the tick green marks on Fig. 6b, from which the period of the modulation could be easily
extracted. The fact that only one peak is observed in both datasets also reinforces the point
19.

that there is no polar direction in the system. These results show and confirm that the
strong confinement prevent the formation of the cycloid and therefore magnon can no more
be folded. In particular, the magnon mode at 0.7 THz cannot exist. This constraint will be
all the more strong in a superlattice having even thinner BFO and LFO layers.
SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 4: OPTICAL BIREFRINGENCE
The optical reflectivity measurement has been performed with a photon energy of 3 eV,
i.e. above the band gap of BFO and LFO. The light polarization was controlled with a
half-plate (light polarization angle). The single domain BiFeO 3thin film with a thickness
of 180 nm clearly shows an optical birefringence (Fig. 7a) as previously discussed [39]. On
the opposite the optical reflectivity measured on the BFO/LFO superlattice does not show
any detectable birefringence (Fig. 7b).
