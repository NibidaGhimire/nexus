Abstract: Magnetic doping of  2D materials such as Transition Metal Dichalcogenides  is promising for 
enhancement of magneto -optical properties, as it was previously observed for 3D diluted magnetic 
semiconductors.  To maximize  the effect of magnetic ions, they should be incorporated i nto the crystal 
lattice of 2D material rather than form  separated precipitates. This work shows study on incorporating 
magnetic manganese ions into the MoSe 2 mono layers  using molecular beam epitax y. We test growth 
on various substrates with very different properties : polycrystalline SiO 2 on Si, exfoliated 2D hexagonal 
Boron Nitride flakes (placed on SiO 2/Si), monocrystalline sapphire, and exfoliated graphite (on 
tantalum foil). Although atomic force microscopy images indicate presence of MnSe precipitates, but 
at the same time, v arious techniques reveal  effects  related to alloy ing MoSe 2 with Mn : Raman 
scattering  and photoluminescence measurements shows energy shift related to presence of Mn , 
scanning transmission microscopy  shows Mn induced partial transformation of 1H to 1T ’ phase . Above 
effects evidence partial incorporation of Mn into MoSe 2 layer.

  1. Introduction  
Electronic  properties of two -dimensional (2D) materials associated with the additional degree of 
freedom originating from magnetic  dopant  spin orientation are being a subject of intense investigation 
due to their  promising application s in 2D spintronic devices  [1,2]. Mn -doped materials from Transition 
Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) family can possibly exhibit enhanced magnetooptical properties and 
fascinating magnetic phenomena as e.g. carrier mediated ferromagnetism  [3,4,5,6]. However, the first 
technical obstacle  to overcome is  low solubility of Mn  dopant . Limitations related to  low solubility  are 
observed in case of most of diluted magnetic semiconductors (except maybe for CdTe [7]), but are 
particularly visible  in case of monolayer materials , e.g. MoSe 2 on graphene, where Mn tends to form 
MnSe clusters  [8]. Solubility limit is  sligh tly less  visible  in case of 2D materials in form of multilayers 
(MoSe 2 on SiO 2 [9]) or nanostructures (MoS 2 [10]). Additionally , reactive substrat es can bind 
manganese atoms and therefore block incorporation into dichalcogenide monolayer [11]. However, 
best  optical properties are reserved for TMDs in form of monolayers , which are  grown on hBN [12,13] 
or encapsulated in hBN [14,15,16]. Consequently, i n our research on growth of MoSe 2 with manganese  
we focus  on synthesis of monolayers . Moreover  to a set of tested substrates (SiO 2, graph ite and 
sapphire ) we added  exfoliated hBN .  
2. Samples  
Studied (Mo,Mn)Se 2 layers  were  grown  using molecular beam epitaxy  in growth chamber  dedicated to 
II-VI semiconductors . Two kinds of molecular sources were used: effusion cells for selenium and 
manganese, where the flux of element was adjusted by changing temperature of cell , and electron -
beam source with a rod, where the molybdenum flux was adjusted by changing power of the source.  
In the same conditions  were o btained  molybdenum diselenide (MoSe 2) – reference sample  and a series 
of manganese -molybdenum diselenide ((Mo,Mn)Se 2) samples . Nominal concentration of manganese  
was estimated  based on the amount of deposited Mo and Mn.  
The following substrates were used: Si with polycrystalline SiO 2 buffer  (SiO 2/Si), exfoliated hexagonal 
Boron Nitride flakes deposited on SiO 2/Si wafer (hBN/SiO 2/Si), Al2O3 (sapphire ) and graphite on 
tantalum foil . Each growth process was characterised by duration, molecular fluxes , temperature of 
substrate during growth and  annealing . Before growth the substrate was degas at t emperature equal 
to predicted post -growth  annealing temperature . Details of growth are gathered in Tables 1 and 2 .

3. Results and discussion  
3.1 Growth on polycrystalline SiO 2/Si and crystalline sapphire  
AFM images of a representative (Mo,M n)Se 2 sample with nominal concentration  of Mn equal 7.5% is 
presented in  the Fig. 1. Next to  it, there are presented AFM images  of two reference samples: pure 
MnSe and pure MoSe 2. When comparing these tree sets of pictures, w e observe  two features : 
relatively rough surface  and high point aggregates . Rough surface  is observed for each s ample  and we 
attribute it to roughness of SiO 2 covered eventuall y by very thin (1 ML) MoSe 2 or (Mo,Mn)Se 2 layers 
that reflects substrate roughness. Since high point aggregates are observed only for samples 
containing Mn, and they are similar to MnSe known from literature [9,17], we attribute them to MnSe  
nanocrystals , and we conclude that we observe  phase segregation. What is also worth mentioning, 
despite relatively high point aggregates, the average roughness (AR) of samples containing manganese 
is lower than the ones without it. Taking into consideration images in Fig. 1. the change can be up to 
around 20%. This effect can be a ssociated  with  the surfactant properties of manganese  that can 
effectively decrease crystallite size  even 4 times  in many various  materials  [18-20]. 
For ph otoluminescence study we have prepared a series of samples on SiO 2/Si substrate with various 
amount of  deposited Mn while amounts of Mo and Se were kept constant. Amount of MoSe 2 was 
chosen to be under 1 monolayer, and then monolayer was fulfilled using various  amounts of Mn.  
Thickness of SiO 2 was 90 nm to optimize PL studies due to positive interferences.  
Fig. 2a. presents room temperature photoluminescence study of MoSe 2 and ( Mo,Mn)Se 2, excited by 
532 nm laser . The addition of manganese has not quenched the intensity of  PL related to MoSe 2, on 
the contrary Mn-infused  samples exhibit slightly higher PL intensity than pure ones . This can be 
explained in a following way: the experiment started with growing an incomplete MoSe 2 monolayer 
resulting in weaker PL, and then, in subsequent samples, increasing amount of manganese has led to 
complementing the monolayer, which improved the intensity of the photoluminescence. The second 
important result related to PL is the shifting of the (Mo,Mn)Se 2 peaks rela tive to the MoSe 2 peak. This 
mean s that manganese influences the band gap energy in the obtained material, which suggests that 
Mn is incorporated into the crystal structure, at least partially. Additionally, Fig. 2b also shows in different scale that PL of  MnSe is  at higher energy than MoSe 2 or (Mo,Mn)Se 2. The origin of the 
observed PL  is divers  in the case of various materials. In the case of MoSe 2 and (Mo,Mn)Se 2, PL close 
to 1.55 - 1.6 eV is related to excitonic  transitions and semiconductor energy band gap. Very differently, 
the energy gap of MnSe is in UV range (see a drop of transmittance of MnSe  close to 3 eV in Fig. 3), 
and PL observed at 1.8 eV is related to d -d transitions of Mn hybridized with   4p4 states of Se [ 17,21 ,22].

roughness was noted as AR=XX.

for excitation.  UW1396 UW1401, UW1400, UW1399 and UW1040 samples were measured.  
 
Effects related to Mn incorporation to the lattice  can be also observed in  transmittance measurements , 
in particular for samples grown on transparent substrate such as sapphire . Results are presented in 
Fig. 3 and show that from transmittance we can learn not only how exciton  A shifts, but we can also 
observe exciton  B. Similarly as in the discussion of PL spectra, the excitonic redshift occurs , suggesting 
that manganese influences the band gap energy in the obtained material.  Moreover, we see that only 
in the situation  of almost pure MnSe, in sample with over 94% of nominal concentration of Mn, MoSe 2 
features related to MoSe 2 exciton s are quenched . This can be understood if we assume partial 
incorporation of Mn in (Mo,Mn)Se 2  and substantial precipitation of Mn in form of MnSe.

samples grown on sapphire. Yellow, bottom line shows MoSe 2 reference sample spectrum,  the lines 
above are spectra from samples with increasing amount of manganese, ordered from the lowest 
concentration, beginning from MoSe 2, the top line is transmittance spectra from MnSe reference 
sample . Spectra are shifted for clarity. Measurements were performed in room temperature using 
white light source.  UW1203, UW1267, UW1266, UW1264, UW1260, UW1258, UW1257, UW1256, 
UW1255, UW1254 and UW1252 samples were employed.   
To study effect of Mn doping, we engaged  also room temperature Raman scattering excited by 532  nm 
laser. We observed that  the characteristic Raman line of MoSe 2 at 241 cm-1 evolves with increasing 
amount of Mn , namely  it shift s towards low energies , as shown in Fig. 4 for samples grown on sapphire . 
Similar effect has been already reported in Ref. [9] for (Mo,Mn)Se 2 grown on SiO 2 and interpreted as a 
consequence of Mn -related strain or Mn intercalation in multilayer struct ure. In each situation , 
presence of Mn very close to MoSe 2 lattice is confirmed. We interpret nonmonotonic dependence of 
line energy versus nominal concentration of Mn, as shown in Fig. 4b, as being a  consequence of Mn 
solubility limit. Despite (Mo,Mn)Se 2 Raman lines are observed at lower energy than MoSe 2, line related 
to MnSe is observed at higher energy than MoSe 2 therefore there is no continues change from one 
material to another. Importantly , MnSe line exhibit much weaker intensity than MoSe 2 line, what 
suggest that peak s in (Mo,Mn)Se 2 originat e from MoSe 2 lattice , even in samples with relatively high 
Mn concertation.

was used for excitation. UW1252, UW1267, UW1266, UW1264, UW1260, UW1258, UW1257, 
UW1256, UW1255, UW1254, UW1203 samples were employed.  
 
3.2 Growth on hBN/SiO 2/Si  
Exfoliated h BN is the inalienably perfect substrate for grow ing MoSe 2 with good optical properties  [12], 
but in our case it also exhibit  the advantage of almost perfect flatness facilitating AFM imaging of 
grown flakes, as shown in Fig. 5. One can find  small 1 ML thick flakes o f TMD and a few nm high points 
similar to observed already on SiO 2 and interpreted as MnSe. Therefore the phase segregation  is 
directly observed . When it comes to surface roughness, one can see that in images in Fig. 5. the main 
roles play very smooth area of uncovered hBN substrate  and flat MoSe 2 flakes area.  These two 
elements respectively , make MnSe and MoSe 2 surfaces less rough than their equivalents in Fig. 1.  
Analizing (Mo,Mn)Se 2 surface on hBN, one can perceive that it is compos ed of plenty of slight MoSe 2 
flakes (size below 50 nm) and  relatively high  MnSe nanocrystals (diameter below 20 nm).  All that 
generate increased surface roughness in comparison to its counterpart from Fig. 1.  
To check if flat TMD flakes contain Mn, we perf ormed PL measurements at helium temperatures, as 
show in Fig. 6.  Also this time , the excitonic PL peak is slightly shifted under the influence of manganese 
ions, suggesting at least partial incorporation of Mn into MoSe 2 lattice . Comparing to very sharp and 
narrow lines of MoSe 2 grown on hBN, (Mo,Mn)Se 2 grown on hBN exhibit s much wider lines, moreover  
charged and neutral exciton lines are not resolved anymore.

3.3 Growth on Graphite  
For better understanding of atoms distribution in studied compound, we have grown  MoSe 2 and 
(Mo,Mn)Se 2 monolayer s on exfoliated graphite - ultra -flat, conductive substrate enabling  Scanning 
Transmission Microscopy  (STM)  investigation s. Results of STM imagi ng of (Mo,Mn)Se 2 are shown in 
Fig. 7b. and 8. They  reveal  coexistence of two crystallographic TMD  phases: 1H – the most popular and 
stable semiconductor one , with trifold symmetry  and 1T’ – more rare, semi metallic phase , with twofold 
symmetry . Importantly , STM imag es didn’t reveal  similar 1T’ phase for pure MoSe 2 without Mn.  Pure 
MoSe 2 sample is shown in Fig. 7a, where STM image is dominated by triangular inversion domains  [23]. 
1T’ phase for MoSe 2 is a very rare case  in a literature , observed only in very particular conditions. The 
article by F eng Cheng  et al.   [24] showed how this phase is induced  by depositing an additional 
molybdenum layer on a gold substrate with selenium reconstitution. Molybdenum creates elevated 
platforms and th en intercalates between selenium and gold atoms. The molybd enum and selenium 
atoms are used up to form MoSe 2. The same report also explains  the phenomenon  by calculations 
showing that the 1T’  phase is favored when the growth takes place on an additional la yer of 
molybdenum, which is a transition metal. This makes it 0.851 eV / MoSe 2 (0.851 eV per one MoSe 2 
molecule) more stable than 1H-MoSe 2. By means of the Bader charge analysis it was shown that the 
charge transfer between MoSe 2 and the d Mo shell stabili zes the 1T’  phase and allows it to be grown 
as dominant. On this basis, we interpreted  that in the case of the studied sample (Mo,Mn)Se 2, the role 
of the additional layer of Mo atoms was taken over by the added Mn, which also belongs to the 
transition meta ls and has a sequence of electron  shells similar to Mo . Which caused the coupling 
between the d -manganese coating and the growing material, and as a result, the formation of the 1T’  
phase.

sample) and b – 1T’ phase of (Mo,Mn)Se 2 (UW1535 sample). Insets with atomic structures come from 
Y. Sim et al.  [23].   
Figure 8.  STM image of (Mo,Mn)Se 2 surface  (UW1535 sample) . There are  strip domains (left frame)  
coexisting with  triangular domains  (right frame) , both corresponding to different crystallographic 
phases . Triangular domains are due to typical defects [ 24] in the most stable form - 1H - while the 
striped area corresponds to the less stable 1T'  phase  [25].  
 
 
 
 
4. Conclusions  
Presented work shows the growth of molybdenum diselenide alloyed with manganese magnetic ions 
on various substrates including polycrystall ine SiO 2, crystalline 3D sapphire and 2D substrates hBN and 
graphite. For each substrate we observe impact of Mn on properties of MoSe 2. Optical spectroscopy 
(photoluminescence, transmittance and Raman scattering) evidences that Mn induces shifts and 
broadening of spectral lines and consequently reveals at least partial incorporation of Mn into MoSe 2 
lattice. In particular we observe lowering of energy gap of (Mo,Mn)Se 2 with increasing concentration 
of Mn. At the same time, AFM imaging reveals also at least partial segregation of MnSe nanocrystals 
from 2D MoSe 2. AFM pictures provides also an example of surface flattening under the influence of 
Mn addition. The change in average roughness can reach around 20% on relatively rough substrates 
such as SiO 2. In case of perfectly flat hBN substrate, addition of Mn only increases roughness.  STM 
imaging reveals that Mn addition  leads to the formation of two kind of domains with typical 1H 
crystallographic phase and rather rare 1T’ crystallographic phase, what ca n be promising in future 
investigations of electron transport in MoSe 2 e.g. in terms of Weyl semimetals [26].
