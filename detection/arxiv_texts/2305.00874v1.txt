 Abstract  
The general framework of LSRTM consists of two steps; the first one is generating 
the RTM image and the second is applying the Least -Squares Migration, however, 
the convergence of both operations consumes a lot of time to extract the final Least -
Squares Reverse -Time Migration image and moreover generates oversampling 
when simulating the data.  Applying R everse -Time Migration  to seismic data will 
generate results  with some  migration  artifacts  depending on the applied imaging 
conditions . To overcome this  dilemma , the Least-Squares Reverse -Time Migration  
is applied to the migrated section through Born modeling  and Conjugate Gradient 
algorithm. Vertical transve rse isotropy  (VTI) media yield ed as the velocity 
decreases with depth which  distorts the Reverse -Time M igration results 
significantly. This problem can be overcome by applying the L east-Squares 
Reverse -Time Migration  in either the Cartesian or pseudo -depth domain s by 
applying a proper wavefield extrapolator.  Extrapolation of L east-Squares Reverse -
Time Migration  reconstructed wavefield using the 2D constant -density acoustic  
wave equation transformed into Riemannian dom ain treats the oversampling effect 
of seismic signals by making even sampling and allows more amplitude to be 
recovered in the final migrated image. For every point in the Cartesian coordinate 
(x, y, z) there is a corresponding vertical -time-point with the  coordinates (ξ1,ξ2,ξ3), 
hence we can interpolate the reconstructed source wavefield in the new ray 
coordinates by drawing a Cartesian -Riemannian mapping function. Regardless of 
the applied F inite Difference  Scheme and the specific boundaries condition s, the 
Riemannian wavefield extrapolator has a generalized  Finite Difference formula. At 
a reduced cost, the Finite Difference  Riemannian wavefield extrapolator acts on the 
Born modelled seismic data, producing accurately similar results to the classical 
LSRTM , yet some amplitude differences are appeared due to various 
implementation issues and oversampling effect in the latter. The results support that 
the domain transformation strategy effectively reduces the computational time 
without affecting the accuracy of the conventional LSRTM results.

 Introduction  
 
The seismic trace contains much information that can be associated with changes in rock 
properties but can be easily masked by an improper processing algorithm. Solutions to the 
wave propagation problems by Finite Difference ( FD) Methods have received cons iderable 
attention in the previous years, in the last decades there has been an increasing interest in the 
description of physical and chemical processes by means of equations involving fractional 
derivatives and integrals. The power of these mathematical techniques has a broad potential 
range of application: fluid dynamics, polymer systems, dynamics of protein molecules, 
seismic wavefield extrapolation and the diffusion of contaminants in complex geological 
formations; are recently suggested applications f ield. The wavefield extrapolation methods 
are particularly attractive for structurally complex subsurface geometries because of the great 
difficulties encountered in obtaining analytical solutions. Geometries of particular interest in 
petroleum exploration  are those containing sharp corners that generate diffractions. Accurate 
and efficient modelling of seismic wavefields that accounts for both attenuation and 
anisotropy is essential for the further development of seismic data processing methods. It is 
show n that all wavefield extrapolation methods are based on two equations: the Taylor series 
and the specific wave equation; hence all errors are inherited from these formulae. The 
powerful method of separation of variables can also be applied to the acoustic wave equation 
in the same way as for the heat and usual diffusion equations. We know the size of these 
errors from the Taylor error formula, in addition, there is a magnification of the errors due to 
the method itself. To investigate this magnification, we  need to look more closely at what the 
Finite Difference Method is doing.  For all geophysical inversions including LSRTM, forward 
modelling is an essential component (Yao et al., 2018). It provides the means to map the 
models into the geophysical data. Its  mathematical expression also provides the theoretical 
basis for formulating the inversion algorithms, especially the gradient. Migration aims to 
determine a model of reflectors; however, wave equations do not include such a model 
parameter representing th e reflectors explicitly. Thus, it is necessary to re -parameterise the 
wave equation for incorporating this parameter into the forward modelling formulas for tau -
domain wavefield migrations.  
 
A revolutionary  era of theoretical physics and computational math ematics  have develop ed the 
field of seismic data processing , due to the advancement in computing and numerical 
modelling techniques  (Wang et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2016), and RTM becomes a mature 4 
 migration algorithm for industrial application (Sava and Fomel, 2003; Zhang et al., 2007; Xu 
et al., 2011). However, the step of backward propagation of recorded data in RTM applies the  
adjoint operator of its forward modelling. Furthermore, the imaging condition widely used for 
RTM is the zero -lag cross -correla tion imaging condition (Claerbout, 1971 ; Claerbout and 
Doherty , 1972 ), instead of a deconvolution imaging condition. This is because the zero -lag 
cross -correlation imaging condition is unconditionally stable, and more convenient for the 
implementation (Yao  and Jakubowicz, 2016). These two limitations, which are the adjoint 
operator and the zero -lag cross -correlation imaging condition, have an impact on the RTM 
seismic imaging, decreasing the resolution and amplitude accuracy of the yielded image. To 
mitigat e the limitations as well as keeping the enhanced features of RTM , LSRTM has been 
introduced . The Born approximation represents the property of the reflectors with impedance 
perturbation while the Kirchhoff approximation describes the property with reflect ivity, and 
he forward modelling formulas based on both approximations include the angles of wave 
propagation  (Jaramillo and Bleistein, 1999; Bleistein et al., 2005; Khaniani et al., 2016 , Yao 
and Jakubowicz, 2016 ). However, it is very complicated and inaccurate to measure the 
propagation direction of waves by numerically solving wave equations, by FDM. As a result, 
the Born approximation under the assumption of constant density is a shooting angle 
independent (Kap lan et al., 2010; Dai et al., 201 2; Khalil et al., 2013).  
 
The Finite Difference Method  is popularly used for solving geophysical problems like wave 
equation modelling (e.g., Virieux, 1984, 1986; Robertsson et al., 1994; Carcione 1990; 
Carcione et al., 2002; Moczo et al., 2007, 2011, 2014; Yao 2013; Khalil et al., 2013; Savioli 
et al., 2017) . LSRTM is achieved by finding an optimal model representing the reflectors to 
fit the observed data in a least -squares sense. Since the inverse operator is used, LSRTM can 
generate migration images with higher resolution, fewer artefacts , balanced and  preserved  
amplitude more than RTM (Dai et al., 2012&2013; Yao and Jakubowicz, 2012; Yao; 2013; 
Zeng et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Tu and Herrmann, 2015; Wu et al., 2016 ; Sun et al., 
2018 ). The developed Q -LSRTM method based on the first -order viscoacousti c quasi -
differential equations by deriving the Q -compensated forward -propagated operators, Q -
compensated adjoint operators and Q -attenuated Born modelling operators (Qu et al. 2021). 
These traveltime equations are somewhat independent of the vertical veloc ity in transversely 
isotropic media (TI) media (Alkhalifah et al.,1997). But truncation of the computational 
domain to a manageable size requires a non -reflecting boundary condition (Mulder, 2021). 
Alkhalifah et al. (2001) , obtained τ -domain wave equation by applying a coordinate 5 
 transformation to the conventional eikonal equation and then develop the dynamic part by 
inverse Fourier transform in space and time to formulate a wave equation in the τ -domain. 
Because of the high -frequency assumption of the eiko nal equation, the resulting wave 
equation is not accurate in amplitudes. Riemannian wavefield extrapolation generalizes 
solutions to the Helmholtz equation of the acoustic wave -equation to non -Cartesian 
coordinate systems, such that extrapolation is not pe rformed strictly in the downward 
direction (Sava and Fomel, 2001; 2005).  The conversion of the vertical axis in the seismic 
data of the conventional domain from depth to vertical time or pseudo -depth creates a non -
orthogonal Riemannian coordinate system (Ma and Alkhalifah, 201 3), known as pseudo -
depth domain, then wavefield ex trapolation for isotropic and anisotropic media in the new 
coordinate frame can improve efficiency with comparison to Cartesian domain extrapolation 
results. The aims of this research are to improve the projection efficiency of the LSRTM 
processed data by using a finite difference scheme projected on a tau -mesh instead of a 
regular Cartesian  one, to minimise calculation time, oversampling of the velocity wavefield, 
produce better imaging results with clearer structures, higher signal to noise ratio ( SNR ), 
higher resolution, more balanced and preserved amplitude, removing migration artefacts and 
diffracted noises (caused by the surface topography). To test this transformation , we provide 
results from synthetic data and compare them with their corresponding on es in the Cartesian 
coordinates. LSRTM in the pseudo -depth domain  to one way -wave equation  can be achieved 
(after Sun et al. 2017;2018)  by converting the velocity field from the depth domain to the 
pseudo domain and then calculating the wavefield in the ps eudo -depth domain. For a fixed -
spread acquisition survey with S shots in total, the computational cost of conventional RTM 
is approximately 𝑆𝛼 (𝛼 is the cost  of one migration operation ). Dai et al. (2012) estimated  the 
speedup of phase -encoding LSRTM  relative to conventional RTM by : 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑝 ≈𝑆
2𝑁𝐼, where, 
𝑁 is sub -supergathers , 2NI𝛼 is computational cost  and 𝐼 is the number of iterations.  
Assuming that each LSRTM iteration takes double cost of one RTM operation.  Thus, the 
speedup is the optimal result that maybe difficult to achieve for practical applications.  
 
General Framework of LSRTM  
 
From Born linearized approximation, the seismic wav efield can be regarded as a 
combination of a perturbation wavefield and a background wavefield. The scalar 
wave equation in a time space domain is expressed as in Dai and Schuster, (2009) 
and Sun et al. (2017). The forward Born modelling  can be compactly e xpressed as a 
matrix -vector multiplication that linearly relates the reflectivity model to the 6 
 scattered seismic data through the forward Born modeling operator ( Jizhong  Yang et 
al. 201 6). A standard migrated image can be computed by applying the adjoint o f 
the forward Born modeling operator to the scattered seismic data (Claerbout, 1992). 
Least -Squares Migration aims to solve the recent reflectivity model by minimizing 
the difference between the forward modelled data and the recorded data in a least -
square s sense. The least -squares has two mathematical approaches  for solving ; the 
conjugate gradient and steepest descent algorithms.  
 
The initial migrated image in this process is a Hessian blurred -version of the sough 
reflectivity image. If the Hessian operator is an identity matrix, then the migration 
operator will produce the same result as LSM. In many cases, however, the Hessian 
operator is not an identity matrix, as its main diagonal elements are nonuniform and 
differ from unity, and the off -diagonal components are non -zero (Chavent and 
Plessix, 1999; Nemeth et al., 1999; Plessix and Mulder, 2004; Valenciano et al., 
2006; Tang, 2009 ; Ren et al., 2011 IN Jizhong  Yang et al. 201 6). The more iteration 
we do the more we minimize the difference in the misfit function as shown in Figs. 
5,6,7,8. As the number of iterations increase the migration results converge to real 
underground image as  shown in the Marmousi model in Figs. 1,2,3,4. In this 
experiment the 2D constant -density acoustic wave equation using a regular -grid 4th -
order space and 2nd -order time FD scheme with P erfectly -Matched Layer (PML) 
boundary conditions is used to build the R TM data (the program is provided by the 
second  author). We clearly can see that Fig.4 has the perfect results of the 
Marmousi model, however, this program is time consuming as the results took 20 
hours and 23 minutes to reach the optimum Marmousi reflectiv ity image.

The Reflections -Ray Coordinates System  
 
The conventional seismic section has two axes; one horizontal  (distance)  and the other is 
vertical  (time) . Vertical time  axis -tau (τ) is the vertical axis for time -migration (Claerbout, 
1985; Yilmaz, 2001; Sava and Fomel 2005; Shragge, 2008; Khalil et al., 2013; Ma and 
Alkhalifa, 2013; Sun et al. 2018). It is defined as the t wo-way traveltime measured by 
coinciding source and receiver on the surface for conventional time image applications, this 
equation is used in the context of laterally invariant media. To project a depth -point (𝑥,𝑦,𝓏) 
to vertical -time-point with the coo rdinates (ξ1,ξ2,ξ3), the vertical axis is converted to time 
axis τ via the relationship (Sun et al. (201)8, Ma and Alkhalifa, (2013 )): 
𝜏𝑇𝑊=2∫𝑑𝓏′
𝑣(𝓏′)𝓏
0                                                                                                       (1) 
The inverse mapping is also straightforward, from differentiation of inverse functions, it 
follows:  
𝓏(𝑥,𝑦,𝜏)=∫𝑣𝑚(𝑥,𝑦,𝜏′)𝑑𝜏′𝜏
0,                                                                                                (2) 
the two coordinate systems are related by:  
11 
 ξ1=𝑥1,      ξ2=𝑥2,     ξ3= 𝜏=∫𝑑𝑥3′
𝑣𝑚(𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑥3′)𝑥3
0                                                                           (3) 
Based on the above transformation we can interpolate any seismic -space functions between 
the Cartesian and τ domains (Ma and Alkhalifa, 2013). The new coordinate system (i.e., τ-
domain) is a continuously changing coordinate system  and called the ray coordi nates (Sava 
and Fomel, 2005). The new coordinates mapping function can be easily evaluated via ray 
tracing or Huygens wavefront tracing (Sava and Fomel, 2001 ; 2005 ). 
 
Wave Equation in Riemannian Coordinates  
 
i-The Helmholtz Wave Equation  
The Helmholtz wave equation depicts a time -independent form of the wave equation, and 
resulted from applying the technique of separation of variables , during the application of FD  
to reduce the complexity of the analysis.  The type of the wave equation which is adopted for 
seismic wavefield simulation  is a simplification of the elast icdynamic equations , obtained  by 
putting the shear wave velocity to zero. In the frequency domain on a Ω domain, the acoustic 
wave equation can be expressed  as: 
−𝜔2
𝜌𝑐2𝑝−∇.(1
𝜌∇𝑝)=𝑠,                                                                                                           (4) 
where the pressure , 𝑝(𝜔,𝐱), depends on the angular frequency 𝜔, the position  x ∈ Ω, 𝜌(𝐱) is 
the density, c( x) is the acoustic speed, and 𝑠(𝜔,𝐱) represents the source term, (∇) is a typical 
delta function. In the presence of attenuation  during propagation of the waves , the complex 
sound speed also depends on frequency (Aki and Richards, 2002) , thus (1 3) becomes : 
1
𝑐(𝜔,𝐱)=1
𝑐0(𝐱)[1−1
𝜋Qlog(𝜔
2𝜋𝑓ref)+𝑖
2Q],                                                                                   (5) 
where Q(𝐱) is the quality factor and the logarithmic term with reference frequency, 𝑓ref,. The 
complex wavenumber used here in Von -Neumann stability analysis is defined by  k(𝜔,𝐱)=
𝜔/𝑐(𝜔,𝐱). Equ ation  (14) supposed to be amalgamated with a suitable absorbing boundary 
condition , usually consisting in a zero Dirichlet condition.  Then, the  Helmholtz wave 
equation for propagating waves in a 3 -D Riemannian space becomes (Sava and Fomel, 2004):  
 1

𝜐2𝒰                                 (6) 
where 𝒰 is a scalar function, 𝜔 is temporal frequency, 𝜐[𝐱(ξ ,η ,ζ)] is the wave propagation 
velocity, and 𝒰 represents a propagating wave, E, F, G , and α are differential forms ( 𝐽2=𝐸𝐺−𝐹2). 
But t he wave equation in the new Riemannian coordinates  system  has two wave field 
formulae  (Ma and Alkhalifah, 2013) as follow ing: 12 
 ii-Isotropic  medium  
A τ-domain two -way wave equation is established by substituting the gradient and  
divergence operators in the wave equation, resulting the system of equations:  
𝜕2𝑝
𝜕𝑡2 =𝑣2(𝜕2𝑝

The last term in  (7) 𝑣2

𝜕τ affect s only the extrapolated wavefield’s amplitude , thus it can  
be neglected  during the extrapolation  operation . 
 
iii-VTI Medium  
The quasi -P-wave motion in transversely isotropic media with vertical axis of symmetry (VTI) 
is described by the following second -order system  of equations  (Duveneck and Bakker, 2011 ; 
In Ma and Alkhalifah, 2013) :

where 𝑝𝐻 and 𝑝𝑉 are horizontal and vertical stresses , respectively,  -q is particle momentum ,  
𝑣𝑣vertical velocity, 𝑣𝑚is mapping velocity, 𝜂 is ellipticity  (𝜂=𝜖−𝛿
1+2𝛿), NMO velocity  is 
given by (𝑣=𝑣𝑣√1+2𝛿) and 𝜖,𝛿 are Thomsen parameters (Thomsen, 1986 ; In Ma and 
Alkhalifah, 2013) . We will implement equation  (8) in solving the wave propagation  in VTI 
media  via FD scheme . 
 
Boundary Condition and Nonorthogonal FD Solutions  
 
In extracting the scattered seismic wavefield, only a limited model space is simulated, and 
artificial boundaries are used to truncate the computational model. These artificial boundaries 
cause pseudo -primaries which in turn produce artefacts within the ex trapolated scattered 
wavefield –in the migrated section. This problem can be solved by using an absorbing 
boundary condition  amalgamated with the Finite Difference scheme. There are many 
different boundary conditions ready to be use, however, the most acce pted and absorbing 
boundary condition at present is the perfectly -matched layer (PML) (after Berenger  1994 ; 
Chew and Liu, 1996 ; Liu and Tao, 1997; Yao, 2013 ). The PML condition creates a fictitious 
material which does not reflect any incident waves and als o exponentially decays any waves 13 
 travelling in it, in addition it removes artificial reflections at the model boundaries, 
nevertheless it is computationally and memory consuming. T he convolutional perfectly 
matched layer (CPML) boundary condition which is derived for isotropic and anisotropic 
acoustic wave equations (Pasalic and McGarry, 2010) , its equations  are expressed as the 
regular wave equations with additional correction terms. The CMPL boundary condition for 
VTI media can be expressed as the followi ng system of equations (Pasalic and McGarry, 
2010):

where 𝑃,𝑅 are pseudo -acoustic wavefields,  𝑐𝑖 & 𝑑𝑖 (𝑖∈{𝑥,𝑦,𝑧}) are velocity coefficients, 𝜓 
is auxiliary variable with time -evolution  and 𝜁𝑝,𝑖 ,𝜁𝑝,𝑖 are auxiliary variables given by:

the parameters  𝑎𝑖 and 𝑏𝑖 are given by:  𝑎𝑖=𝑒−(𝜎𝑖+𝛼𝑖)∆𝑡 ; 𝑏𝑖=𝜎𝑖
𝜎𝑖+𝛼𝑖(𝑎𝑖−1).                     (10) 
From the  above  Helmholtz wave equatio n (Mulder, 2021), a  Dirichlet boundary condition for 
implementing the FD solution is defined  on a domain  Ω, where; Ω ={(𝑥,𝓏)|𝑥∈
[𝑥min,𝑥max], 𝓏∈ [𝓏min,𝓏max]} , at the rest of the boundary Γ𝑛=𝜕Ω
Γ0 , we l ay a Finite

−𝑘𝑖,𝑗2𝑝𝑖,𝑗−𝑝𝑖,𝑗

𝜌𝑖,𝑗−1/2]=𝜌𝑖,𝑗𝑠𝑖,𝑗,                      (11)  
The final derivation  of th e above  formula  called a numerically exact non -reflecting  boundary 
condition  (Mulder, 2021 ) on one side of the domain. At the end , the FD solution of the 
equation ( 7, 8) in a generalized Riemannian coordinates system through Domain -limited FD 
scheme is given in Khalil et al., (2013) as following :

 The Riemannian -mesh stencil ’s coefficients are : 𝑐𝑛𝑛=𝛾𝛽12

Δ𝜏2+𝛼11+𝛼21
2Δ𝜏) ,  𝑐𝑜𝑜𝜏=2𝛾(𝛽11
Δ𝜏2) , 𝑐𝑝𝑝=𝑐𝑛𝑛 , 𝛾=(∆𝑡𝑣)2. 
 
The stencil’s coefficients are functions of  vertical traveltime  (𝜏) and shooting angle ( 𝜙) (Sava 
and Fomel, 2001; 2005),  then we can define the coordinate mapping functions  as in equation 
(3), we can estimate the CFL condition for the stability of the scheme roughly by : 𝐶𝐹𝐿 =√𝛾
𝜏.Δ𝜙. 
The extrapolation process can only be limited the reconstructed source wavefield (Khalil et 
al., 2013)  which is sufficient to perform the Pseudo -domain LSRTM.  
 
Numerical Experiments and Results  
 
Fig.9 represents  an impulse response  using a homogeneous anisotropic velocity model,  
generated by constructing a specific computational code recipe , and has a vertical velocity  of 
2.1 k m.s-1, NMO velocity of 1 .642  km.s-1 and an -ellipticity eta =  0.1. Moreover, to the 
reduced computational cost, tau -domain anisotropic extrapolation also attenuates Cartesian -
domain -related -extrapolated shear wave artifacts. Fig.9b show s the removal of the shear 
wave artefact  in tau -domain , with coarser vertical sampling  which in turn enhance the 
numerical dispersion of shear waves,  that generated in the Cartesian  domain  (Fig.9a), while 
Fig.9c represents  the signal difference s between the two projection schemes.   
 
Figs.10,11&12 display  part of anisotropic Marmousi (VTI) dataset with Pre -stack LSRTM in 
both Cartesian  and Riemannian domain s and after conversion back from tau domain , 
respectively . The original Marmousi data set contains 240 shots with 96 traces per shot  and 
total recording time of 2.9 seconds, this anisotropic dataset has peak frequency of 30 Hz, 
spread length up to 3 .0 km. Parts of the model are potentially invertible below the su rface 
location of 3 km . The Cartesian -based LSRTM in Fig s.10&12 obtained by applying Born 
approximation and CG -algorithm , while the conversion of the RTM reflectivity model  to tau 
domain  in Fig. 11 treats the model evenly but some  still some  distortions  appear . The final 
LSRTM result in Fig. 12 shows  slightly -enhanced image after converting it back to Cartesian  
domain  because of  balancing the amplitude and removing artefacts . The results took 5 hours 
and 30 minutes (measured by a stop ping watch) to be obtained on a high-speed PC cluster . 15 
 The reservoir appears all its sections  between 2.0 km to 3.0 km , but its position is slightly 
shifted in figure 1 1, this can be attributed to anisotro pic extrapolation of the wavefield on tau 
domain .

Conclusion  
 
Conventional LSRTM gives proper migra tion results  as shown in Fig . 4. Riemannian space 
by definition is described as a non -orthogonal curvilinear coordinate s system. Using it to 
perform LSRTM, speedup the extrapolation of the anisotropic LSRTM wavefield more than 
doing it with Cartesian mesh . Despite are the migration results obtained with  the same 
number of iterations , the accuracy of the final migration results almost identical  before or 
after the conversion . However,  shear wave artefacts can be removed properly when 
17 
 projecting the VTI seismic data on Riemannian domain.  It is therefore evident that further 
research  is required to obtain advanced  results, including processing  3D seismic data , 
stability analysis of the FD scheme , viscoacoustic LSRTM and non -linear LSRTM.

 2021 International Academic Forum for 
Graduate Students of “Oil and Gas • 
Intelligence @Future scientist”  
 
Oil and gas energies have the important roles in the national economic and social 
development. Artificial Intelligence and big data analysis are two new and necessary 
technologies to boost future exploration and development of the deep -superdeep, 
unconvent ional oil and gas reservoirs.  How to explore and develop the complex oil and gas 
reservoirs with higher efficiency and intelligence is becoming more and more attention in the 
industry and scientific area. In order to improve the academic research and inno vation ability 
of graduate students, and establish an international academic exchange platform, the 
International Academic Forum for graduate students of “Future Scientists” in Shandong will be 
hosted by China University of Petroleum (East China) in the earlier of November , 2021 at
