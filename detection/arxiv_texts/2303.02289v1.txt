ABSTRACT
In this manuscript, central BH mass is determined in the tida l disruption event (TDE) candidate SDSS J0159,
through the nine years long variabilities, in order to check whether the virial BH mass is consistent with the
mass estimated by another independent methods. First, host galaxy spectroscopic features are described by 350
simple stellar templates, to conﬁrm the total stellar mass a bout 7×1010M⊙in SDSS J0159, indicating the virial
BH mass about two magnitudes larger than the BH mass estimate d by the total stellar mass. Second, based on an
eﬃcient method and ﬁtting procedure, through theoretical T DE model applied to describe the SDSS /u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456/u1D467 -band
light curves of SDSS J0159, central BH mass can be determined as/u1D440/u1D435/u1D43B∼4.5+1.3
−1.1×106M⊙, well consistent
with the M-sigma relation expected BH mass and the total stel lar mass expected BH mass. Third, the theoretical
TDE model with parameter of central BH mass limited to be high er than 108M⊙can not lead to reasonable
descriptions to the light curves of SDSS J0159, indicating c entral BH mass higher than 108M⊙is not preferred in
SDSS J0159. Therefore, the TDE model determined central BH m ass of SDSS J0159 are about two magnitudes
lower than the virial BH mass, to support central BLRs includ ing accreting debris contributions from central
TDE, and provide interesting clues to reconﬁrm that outlier s in the space of virial BH mass versus stellar velocity
dispersion should be better candidates of TDE.

1.INTRODUCTION
SDSS J0159 (=SDSS J015957.64+003310.5) at red-
shift/u1D467=0.312 (corresponding luminosity distance
about 1625Mpc) is an interesting object in the literature.
LaMassa et al. (2015) have reported the SDSS J0159 as the
ﬁrst changing-look quasar transitioned from a Type 1 quasar
(both apparent broad H /u1D6FCand H/u1D6FDin optical spectrum) to a
Type 1.9 AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) (only weak broad H /u1D6FC
in optical spectrum) between 2000 and 2010, and reported
the dimming of the AGN continuum as intrinsic physical
reason to explain the changing-look properties. Meanwhile ,
Merloni et al. (2015) have reported the SDSS J0159 as a can-
didate of Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) due to the very rapid
rise and the decay trend of the long-term optical variabilit ies
well described by /u1D461−5/3expected by theoretical TDE model,
indicating TDEs can be well treated as one explanation to

A star can be tidally disrupted by gravitational tidal force
of a central massive black hole (BH), when it passing close
to the central BH with a distance larger than event horizon of
the BH but smaller than the expected tidal disruption radius
/u1D445T=/u1D445★× (/u1D440BH
/u1D440★)1/3, where/u1D445★,/u1D440★and/u1D440BHrepresent
radius and mass of the tidally disrupted star and central BH
mass, respectively. And then, fallback materials from tida lly
disrupted star can be accreted by the central massive BH,
leading to a ﬂare up follows by a decrease. This is the basic
picture of a TDE.
The well-known pioneer work on TDE can be found
inRees (1988). Since then, as an excellent beacon
for indicating massive black holes, both theoretical sim-
ulations and observational results on TDEs have been
widely studied and reported in the literature. More de-
tailed and improved simulations on TDEs can be found
inEvans & Kochanek (1989);Magorrian & Tremaine
(1999);Bogdanovic et al. (2004);Lodato et al. (2009);2 Z/h.pc/a.pc/n.pc/g.pc X/u.pc/e.pcG/u.pc/a.pc/n.pc/g.pc
MacLeod et al. (2012);Guillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz (2015);
Lodato et al. (2015);Bonnerot et al. (2017);Darbha et al.
(2018);Coughlin & Nixon (2019);Curd & Narayan
(2019);Golightly et al. (2019), etc.. More recent re-
views in detail on TDEs can be found in Stone et al.
(2018). And based on theoretical TDE model, pub-
lic codes of TDEFIT provided by Guillochon et al.
(2014) ( https://github.com/guillochon/tdeﬁt ) and
MOSFIT provided by Guillochon et al. (2018)
(https://github.com/guillochon/mosﬁt ) have been well ap-
plied to describe both structure evolutions in details for t he
falling back stellar debris and evolutions of expected time -
dependent long-term variability through hydrodynamical
simulations. Therefore, TDE models with suﬃcient model
parameters can be applied to describe observed long-term
variability from TDEs.
Meanwhile, there are so-far around one hundred obser-
vational results on TDE candidates reported in the lit-
erature based on TDE expected variability properties in
diﬀerent multi-wavelength bands, such as the reported
TDE candidates in Komossa et al. (2004);Cenko et al.
(2012);Gezari et al. (2012);Holoien et al. (2014,2016);
Lin et al. (2017);Tadhunter et al. (2017);Mattila et al.
(2018);Wang et al. (2018);Holoien et al. (2020);Liu et al.
(2020);Neustadt et al. (2020);Goodwin et al. (2022), etc..
More recently, van Velzen et al. (2021) have reported seven-
teen TDE candidates from the First Half of ZTF (Zwicky
Transient Facility) Survey observations along with Swift U V
and X-ray follow-up observations. Sazonov et al. (2021) have
reported thirteen TDE candidates from the SRG all-sky surve y
observations and then conﬁrmed by follow-up optical obser-
vations. More recent review on observational properties of
reported TDEs can be found in Gezari (2021).
Among the reported TDE candidates, SDSS J0159 is an
interesting object, because its central virial BH mass re-
ported as ∼108M⊙inLaMassa et al. (2015);Merloni et al.
(2015) through the virialization assumptions ( Peterson et al.
2004;Greene & Ho 2005 ;Vestergaard & Peterson 2006 ;
Kelly & Bechtold 2007 ;Raﬁee & Hall 2011 ;Shen et al.
2011;Mejia-Restrepo et al. 2022 ) applied to BLRs (broad
emission line regions) clouds, the largest BH mass among
the reported BH masses of TDE candidates in Wevers et al.
(2017);Mockler et al. (2019);Zhou et al. (2021);Wong et al.
(2022). However, variations of accretion ﬂows have appar-
ent eﬀects on dynamical structures of BLRs, if the BLRs
clouds are tightly related to TDEs, such as the more detailed
abnormal variabilities of broad emission lines in the TDE ca n-
didate ASASSN-14li in Holoien et al. (2016): strong emis-
sions leading to wider line widths of broad H /u1D6FCwhich are
against the expected results by the Virialization assumpti ons
to BLRs clouds. More recently, Zhang et al. (2019) have
measured the stellar velocity dispersion about 81 ±27km/s ofSDSS J0159 through the absorption features around 4000Å,
reported that the M-sigma relation ( Ferrarese & Merritt 2000 ;
Gebhardt et al. 2000 ;Kormendy & Ho 2013 ;Bennert et al.
2015) determined central BH mass are about two magnitudes
smaller than the virial BH mass in SDSS J0159, and provided
an interesting clue to detect TDE candidates by outliers in t he
space of virial BH masses versus stellar velocity dispersio ns.
Moreover, Charlton et al. (2019) have shown the total stel-
lar mass of SDSS J0159 is about 4 .7×1010M⊙, indicating
the central BH mass about 6 ×106M⊙(the accepted value in
Wong et al. (2022)) in SDSS J0159 through the correlation
between central BH mass and total stellar mass as discussed
inHaring & Rix (2004);Sani et al. (2011);Kormendy & Ho
(2013);Reines & Volonteri (2015), roughly consistent with
the BH mass estimated by the M-sigma relation reported in
our previous paper Zhang et al. (2019). Therefore, besides
the virial BH mass through virialization assumption to BLRs
clouds and the BH mass through the M-sigma relation and
through the total stellar mass, BH mass of SDSS J0159 deter-
mined through one another independent method will be very
interesting and meaningful.
More recently, Guillochon et al. (2014);Mockler et al.
(2019);Ryu et al. (2020);Zhou et al. (2021) have shown that
the long-term TDE model expected time-dependent variabil-
ity properties can be well applied to estimate central BH
masses of TDE candidates. However, SDSS J0159 is not dis-
cussed in Mockler et al. (2019);Ryu et al. (2020);Zhou et al.
(2021), probably due to lack of information of peak inten-
sities of light curves in SDSS J0159 and/or other unknown
reasons. Therefore, in the manuscript, the central BH mass
of SDSS J0159 is to be estimated by theoretical TDE model
applied to describe the long-term optical variabilities. I t is
very interesting to check whether would the reported virial
BH mass or M-sigma relation determined BH mass be co-
incident with the TDE model determined BH mass. The
manuscript is organized as follows. In section 2, we present
spectroscopic features of SDSS J0159, in order to re-conﬁrm
the low stellar velocity dispersion and the low total stella r
mass. Section 3 shows our methods with a TDE model ap-
plied to describe observed multi-band light curves. Then, t he
main results and necessary discussions are shown in Section
4. Section 5 shows simulating results to check whether the
long-term variabilities are tightly related to a central TD E in
SDSS J0159. Section 6 gives our main summary and ﬁnal
conclusions. And in the manuscript, the cosmological param -
eters of/u1D43B0=70km·s−1Mpc−1,ΩΛ=0.7 andΩ/u1D45A=0.3
have been adopted.
2.SPECTROSCOPIC RESULTS OF SDSS J0159
InZhang et al. (2019), the stellar velocity dispersion
about 81 ±27km/s of SDSS J0159 has been mea-
sured through absorption features around 4000Å in theBH /m.pc/a.pc/s.pc/s.pc /i.pc/n.pc SDSS J0159 3

and the area ﬁlled by red lines around 5000Å shows the region

features of broad and narrow H /u1D6FC, [N/i.pc/i.pc] and [S /i.pc/i.pc] doublets. Bottom

which includes apparent host galaxy contributions, based
on the 39 simple stellar population templates from the
Bruzual & Charlot (2003). In the section, the SSP (simple
Stellar Population) method discussed in Bruzual & Charlot
(1993);Kauﬀmann et al. (2003b );Cappellari & Emsellem
(2004);Cid Fernandes et al. (2005,2013);Zhang (2014);
Lopez Fernandez et al. (2016);Cappellari (2017);Werle
(2019) is re-applied to mainly determine the total stellar mass
in SDSS J0159 but with more plenty of stellar templates,
in order to check whether are there low total stellar mass
in SDSS J0159, which will provide further clues on cen-
tral BH mass. In the section, the spectrum with plate-mjd-
ﬁberid=3609-55201-0524is mainly considered and collecte d
from the eBOSS (Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey) ( Ahumada et al. 2020 ;Abdurro’uf et al. 2022 ), due
to the following main reason. The eBOSS spectrum with ap-
parent stellar absorption features of SDSS J0159 in the Type
1.9 AGN state is observed at the late times of the TDE ex-
pected ﬂare, with few eﬀects of TDE on the spectroscopic
features.Due to the weak but apparent broad H /u1D6FCin SDSS J0159
observed in mjd=55201, contributions from central AGN
continuum emissions should be considered. Here, 350 SSP
templates /u1D446/u1D459/u1D456/u1D44Fare collected from the MILES (Medium res-
olution INT Library of Empirical Spectra) stellar library
(Falcon-Barroso et al. 2011 ;Knowles et al. 2021 ) with 50
stellar ages from 0.06Gyrs to 17.78Gyrs and with 7 metal-
licities from -2.32 to 0.22, and the simple SSP method is re-
applied to determine the host galaxy stellar lights and the c en-
tral AGN continuum emissions, through the following model
function
/u1D446/u1D454=/u1D434⊗/u1D446/u1D459/u1D456/u1D44F,/u1D70E,/u1D449 /u1D460+/u1D6FC×/u1D706/u1D6FD(1)
with/u1D446/u1D454as the SDSS spectrum of SDSS J0159, /u1D446/u1D459/u1D456/u1D44F,/u1D70E,/u1D449 /u1D460
as the broadened and shifted stellar templates with broad-
ening velocity /u1D70Eand shifting velocity /u1D449/u1D460,/u1D6FC×/u1D706/u1D6FDas the
AGN continuum emissions. Then, through the Levenberg-
Marquardt least-squares minimization technique (the know n
MPFIT package), with emission lines being masked out, the
weights/u1D434and the power law continuum emissions can be
well determined. Fig. 1shows the best descriptions and cor-
responding residuals to the SDSS spectrum with rest wave-
length range from 3650Å to 7700Å by the model function
above, with /u1D7122∼0.93 (summed squared residuals divided
by degree of freedom) and with residuals calculated by SDSS
spectrum minus the best descriptions.
Based on the best descriptions, total stellar mass is deter-
mined to be about
/u1D440/u1D461/u1D45C/u1D461∼/summationdisplay.1
/u1D434×4/u1D70B /u1D437/u1D456/u1D4602.//u1D448/u1D45B/u1D456/u1D461//u1D43F⊙∼7.11×1010M⊙(2)
with/u1D43F⊙=3.826×1033erg/s as the solar luminosity, and
/u1D437/u1D456/u1D460=1623/u1D440/u1D45D/u1D450 as the distance between SDSS J0159 and
the earth, and /u1D448/u1D45B/u1D456/u1D461=10−17erg/s/cm2/Åas the emission
intensity unit of the SDSS spectrum. The calculated total
stellar mass in SDSS J0159 is roughly consistent with the
reported 4 .7+8.0
−3.9×1010M⊙inCharlton et al. (2019) and the
reported 2 .3+0.7
−0.1×1010M⊙inGraur et al. (2018), indicating
lower central BH mass in SDSS J0159.
Therefore, the low total stellar mass in SDSS J0159 can
be well conﬁrmed, and lead to expected lower central BH
mass than the Virial BH mass in SDSS J0159. Then, besides
the lower total stellar mass in SDSS J0159, it is interesting
to check whether the TDE model can still lead to diﬀerent
central BH mass in SDSS J0159.
3.MAIN METHOD AND FITTING PROCEDURE TO
DESCRIBE THE LIGHT CURVES
Similar as what we have recently done in Zhang (2022a )
to describe X-ray variabilities in the TDE candidate Swift
J2058.4+0516 with relativistic jet, the following four ste ps
are applied to describe the long-term optical /u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456/u1D467 -band vari-
abilities of SDSS J0159. The similar procedures have also4 Z/h.pc/a.pc/n.pc/g.pc X/u.pc/e.pcG/u.pc/a.pc/n.pc/g.pc
been applied in Zhang (2022b ) to discuss TDE expected
long-term variabilities in the high redshift quasar SDSS
J014124+010306 and in Zhang (2022c ) to discuss TDE ex-
pected long-term variabilities of broad H /u1D6FCline luminosity in
the known changing-look AGN NGC 1097.
First, standard templates of viscous-delayed accretion ra tes
in TDEs are created. Based on the discussed /u1D451/u1D440//u1D451/u1D438
provided in ( Guillochon et al. 2014 ,2018;Mockler et al.
2019) (the fundamental elements in the public code of
TDEFIT and MOSFIT), templates of fallback material
rate∝dotacc/u1D440/u1D453 /u1D44F/u1D461=/u1D451/u1D440//u1D451/u1D438×/u1D451/u1D438//u1D451/u1D461can be calculated with
/u1D451/u1D438//u1D451/u1D461∼(2/u1D70B /u1D43A /u1D440 BH)2/3
3/u1D4615/3 , for the standard cases with
central BH mass /u1D440BH=106M⊙and disrupted main-
sequence star of /u1D440∗=1M⊙and with a grid of the
listed impact parameters /u1D6FD/u1D461inGuillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz
(2013). Considering the viscous delay eﬀects as discussed
inGuillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz (2013);Mockler et al. (2019)
by the viscous timescale /u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D460, templates of viscous-delayed
accretion rates ∝dotacc/u1D440/u1D44E/u1D461can be determined by
∝dotacc/u1D440/u1D44E/u1D461=/u1D452/u1D465/u1D45D(−/u1D461//u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D460)

0/u1D452/u1D465/u1D45D(/u1D461′//u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D460)∝dotacc/u1D440/u1D453 /u1D44F/u1D461/u1D451/u1D461′(3)
. Here, a grid of 31 log (/u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D460, /u1D461/years)range from -3 to 0 are
applied to create templates ∝dotacc/u1D440/u1D44E/u1D461for each impact parameter.
The ﬁnal templates of ∝dotacc/u1D440/u1D44E/u1D461include 736 (640) time-dependent
viscous-delayed accretion rates for 31 diﬀerent /u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D460of each
23 (20) impact parameters for the main-sequence star with
polytropic index /u1D6FEof 4/3 (5/3).
Second, for common TDE cases with model parameters of
/u1D6FDand/u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D460diﬀerent from the list values in /u1D6FD/u1D461and in/u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D460, /u1D461,
the actual viscous-delayed accretion rates ∝dotacc/u1D440/u1D44Eare created by
the following two linear interpolations. Assuming that /u1D6FD1,
/u1D6FD2in the/u1D6FD/u1D461are the two values nearer to the input /u1D6FD, and
that/u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D4601,/u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D4602in the/u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D460, /u1D461 are the two values nearer to

SDSS/u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456/u1D467 -band time dependent luminosities as discussed
inMerloni et al. (2015) can be calculated by

because that the collected light curves of SDSS J0159 are the

Finally, the theoretical TDE model expected time depen-

by the following seven model parameters, the central BH
mass log (/u1D440BH/106/u1D440⊙), the stellar mass log (/u1D440★)(corre-
sponding stellar radius /u1D445★calculated by the mass-radius
relation), the energy transfer eﬃciency log (/u1D702), the impact
parameter log (/u1D6FD), the viscous timescale log (/u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D460), the pa-
rameters /u1D459/u1D45Dand/u1D4450related to the black-body photosphere
model. Meanwhile, the redshift 0.312 of SDSS J0159 is ac-
cepted. Then, through the through the well-known maximum
likelihood method combining with the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) technique ( Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013 ), the
/u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456/u1D467 -band light curves of SDSS J0159 can be well described,
with accepted prior uniform distributions and starting val ues
of the model parameters listed in Table 1. Meanwhile, the
available BH masses and stellar masses are the ones leading

4.MAIN RESULTS AND NECESSARY DISCUSSIONS
The observed light curves (the time dependent luminosi-
ties) in SDSS /u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456/u1D467 bands for SDSS J0159 are shown in
Fig.2with the data points are directly collected from Ta-
ble 2 in Merloni et al. (2015) after subtractions of host galaxy
contributions. This is the main reason why the time depen-
dent luminosities rather than the apparent magnitudes are
collected, because the host galaxy contributions have been
clearly removed from the time dependent luminosities. Then ,
based on the discussed method and ﬁtting procedure in sec-
tion above, the observed /u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456/u1D467 -band light curves of SDSS
J0159 are simultaneously described by the theoretical TDE
model with seven model parameters. Fig. 2shows the best
ﬁtting results and the corresponding conﬁdence bands after
considerations of the uncertainties of model parameters ba sed
on the theoretical TDE model.
It is clear that besides the /u1D467-band light curve statistically
lower than the theoretical TDE model expected values, the
other/u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456-bands light curves can be well described by the
theoretical TDE model. However, as simply discussed in
Guillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz (2013);Mockler et al. (2019),
the simple black-body photosphere model can be well ap-
plied to describe optical band variabilities, considering the
probable additional contributions of NIR emissions from
dust clouds, the simple black-body black-body photosphere
model is not preferred to describe the /u1D467-band variabilities.
Certainly, a simply strengthened TDE model expected the-
oretical/u1D467-band light curve by a factor 2 (dot-dashed lines
in the last panel of Fig. 2) can be well applied to describe
the observed /u1D467-band light curve. Furthermore, as well dis-
cussed in Lu et al. (2016);Jiang et al. (2017,2021), thereshould be apparent IR contributions to /u1D467-band light curve of
SDSS J0159 at /u1D467=0.312, considering that radiation pho-
tons from the central TDE are absorbed by dust grains and
then re-radiated in the infrared band, similar as discussed
inGuillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz (2013);Mockler et al. (2019).
In other words, if the additional contributions were remove d,
the/u1D467-band light curve obey the same TDE expected variability
properties as those in /u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456-bands.
Fig.3shows the MCMC technique determined two dimen-
sional posterior distributions in contours of the seven mod el
parameters. The accepted values of the model parameters are
listed in Table 1. The central BH masses /u1D440/u1D435/u1D43B(106M⊙)in
SDSS J0159 are about ∼5.7+0.8
−0.7and∼3.3+0.5
−0.4by applications
of TDE model with /u1D6FE=4/3 and with /u1D6FE=5/3, respectively.
Moreover, comparing with the reported parameters for the
TDE candidates in Mockler et al. (2019), the reported values
of the model parameters are common values among the TDE
candidates.
Before proceeding further, it is necessary to consider
whether central BH with mass around 108M⊙(the virial BH
mass) can also lead to accepted descriptions to the /u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456-band
light curves /one.supof SDSS J0159. Therefore, besides the best ﬁt-
ting results determined through the seven model parameters
as free parameters with prior uniform distributions, the TD E
model and the ﬁtting procedure is running again, but with the
central BH mass having the prior uniform distribution limit ed
from 1×108M⊙to 5×108M⊙and the other model parameters
having the same prior uniform distributions as what have bee n
applied above. Then, the TDE model determineddescriptions
are shown as dotted purple lines and dotted pink lines in the
ﬁrst four panels of Fig. 2, which are worse to explain the rise-
to-peak trend. However, if the ﬁrst data point shown in Fig. 2
(MJD-50200=880) was not related to the expected central
TDE (i.e., starting time of the expected central TDE was late r
than MJD-50200=880), the determined descriptions with ac-
cepted virial BH mass could be also well accepted. However,
after considering the following two points, the data point a t
MJD-50200=880 is considered to be related to central tran-
sient event. First, as listed values in Table 2 in Merloni et al.
(2015), the luminosity at MJD-50200=880 is at least about
2 times stronger than the data points at late times of the
event with MJD-50200 later than 4000, indicating that the
ﬁrst data point at MJD-50200=880 related to central event
is preferred in SDSS J0159. Second, the CSS ( Drake et al.
2009) V-band photometric light curve at quiescent state of
SDSS J0159 is collected and shown in bottom right panel of
Fig2. The CSS V-band light curve has standard deviation
about 0.12mag, leading corresponding luminosity variabil ity
to be about 11.2%, quite smaller than the luminosity ratio
/one.supConsidering probable contributions from dust emissions, t he/u1D467-band light
curve is not considered here.6 Z/h.pc/a.pc/n.pc/g.pc X/u.pc/e.pcG/u.pc/a.pc/n.pc/g.pc

about 2 of the ﬁrst data point at MJD-50200=880 to the data
points at late times. Therefore, the model with central BH
mass larger than 108M⊙are not preferred in SDSS J0159.
Based on the results shown in Fig. 2and posterior distribu-
tions of model parameters shown in Fig. 3, there are two inter-
esting points we can ﬁnd. First, the observed light curves ca n
be well described by the theoretical TDE model,strongly ind i-
cating a TDE around central BH of SDSS J0159 as suggested
inMerloni et al. (2015). Second, diﬀerent model parame-
ters can lead to observed light curves being well described
by TDE models, however, the diﬀerent model parameters
in TDE models leading to much diﬀerent properties on fea-
tures around peak. In other words, once there were observed
high quality light curves with apparent features around pea k
intensities, the sole TDE model can be determined. Fortu-
nately, due to the similar BH masses in the TDE models with
diﬀerent polytropic indices, it is not necessary to further de-
termine which TDE model, the TDE model with polytropic
index/u1D6FE=4/3 or the model with /u1D6FE=5/3, is preferred in
SDSS J0159, because only BH mass properties are mainly
considered in the manuscript.
Moreover, based on the listed TDE model determined pa-
rameters (logarithmic values) in Table 1,the stellar mass o f the
tidally disrupted main-sequence star is about /u1D440★∼1.97M⊙
(/u1D440★∼1.93M⊙) for/u1D6FE=4/3 (/u1D6FE=5/3), which is out of
the transition range between 0 .3M⊙and 1M ⊙for stars as
discussed in Mockler et al. (2019). Therefore, we do not
consider hybrid fallback functions that smoothly blend be-
tween the 4/3 and 5/3 polytopes,as suggested in Mockler et al.
(2019). Meanwhile, as the shown best-ﬁtting results to the
/u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456-bands light curves of SDSS J0159 in Fig. 2, applica-
tions of the polytropic index /u1D6FE=4/3 and/u1D6FE=5/3 individ-ually can lead to well accepted descriptions to the observed
light curves, re-indicating that it is not necessary to desc ribe
long-term variabilities of SDSS J0159 with considerations of
hybrid fallback functions that smoothly blend between the 4 /3
and 5/3 polytopes.
Based on the theoretical TDE model determined BH mass
/u1D440/u1D435/u1D43B∼4.5+1.3
−1.1×106M⊙(the mean value of the two BH
masses determined by theoretical TDE models with dif-
ferent polytropic indices), we can check the dependence
of BH mass on stellar velocity dispersion in SDSS J0159
in Fig. 4. Comparing with the reported M-sigma rela-
tions for both quiescent galaxies in McConnell & Ma (2013);
Kormendy & Ho (2013);Savorgnan & Graham (2015) and in
AGN in Ho & Kim (2014);Woo et al. (2015), the TDE model
determined BH mass is well consistent with the M-sigma re-
lation expected value in SDSS J0159. Moreover, considering
the reported BH masses of TDE candidates in Zhou et al.
(2021) which we shown as solid cyan circles in Fig. 4, the
TDE model determined central BH mass is preferred in SDSS
J0159, rather than the virial BH mass about two magnitudes
higher than the expected value. Furthermore, Fig. 5shows the
correlation between TDE model determinedBH masses /u1D440/u1D435/u1D43B
and TDE model determined energy transfer eﬃciency /u1D702of the
TDE candidates in Mockler et al. (2019);Zhou et al. (2021).
It is clear that the SDSS J0159 as a radio quiet object is com-
mon as the other TDE candidates in the space of /u1D440/u1D435/u1D43Bversus
/u1D702, besides the TDE candidate swift J2058.4+0516 with rela-
tivistic jet related to central TDE ( Cenko et al. 2012 ;Zhang
2022a ). Therefore, the BH mass about 106M⊙in SDSS J0159
is reasonable enough.
The TDE model determined central BH mass two magni-
tudes smaller than virial BH mass in SDSS J0159 provide
robust evidence to support that the BLRs in SDSS J0159 in-
clude strong contributions of accreting debris from centra l
TDE, leading the dynamical properties of disk-like BLRs as
discussed in Zhang (2021c ). And the results in the manuscript
to reconﬁrm that outliers in the space of virial BH masses ver -
sus stellar velocity dispersions could be better candidate s of
TDEs.
Furthermore, simple discussions are given on variability
properties of broad H /u1D6FC, to support that the Virialization as-
sumption applied to estimate virial BH mass is not appropria te
to be applied to estimate central virial BH mass in SDSS
J0159. Under the widely accepted virialization assump-
tion for broad line AGN as well discussed in Peterson et al.

. There are quite larger /u1D4494×/u1D43Fin 2010 than in 2000.
Furthermore, if considering serious obscuration of the bro ad
Balmer lines in 2010 (no broad H /u1D6FDdetected in 2010), the10 Z/h.pc/a.pc/n.pc/g.pc X/u.pc/e.pcG/u.pc/a.pc/n.pc/g.pc
luminosity of broad H /u1D6FCin 2010 should be larger, leading to
more larger /u1D4494×/u1D43Fin 2010. The results indicating some
none-virialcomponents are actually included in the broad l ine
variabilities, to support our results in the manuscript to s ome
extent.
Before the end of the section, three additional points are
noted. First and foremost, as the shown results in Fig. 2,
there is a smaller ﬂare around MJD-50200 ∼2700 in SDSS
J0159, which can be simply accepted as a re-brightened
peak. Among the reported TDEs candidates, ASASSN-15lh
reported in Leloudas et al. (2016) is the known TDE candi-
date with re-brightened peak in its long-term light curves. So
far, it is not unclear on the physical origin of re-brightene d
peaks in TDEs candidates. As discussed in Leloudas et al.
(2016), circularization could be eﬃciently applied to explain
re-brightened peak in TDE expected light curves. Mean-
while, as discussed in Mandel & Levin (2015), re-brightened
peak could be expected when a binary star is tidally disrupte d
by a central BH. And as discussed in Coughlin & Armitage
(2018), re-brightened peak could be expected when a star is
tidally disrupted by a central binary black hole system with
extreme mass ratio. Unfortunately,there are not enough inf or-
mation to determine which proposed method is preferred to
explain the re-brightened peak around MJD-50200 ∼2700 in
SDSS J0159. Further eﬀorts in the near future are necessary
to discuss properties of the re-brightened peak in SDSS J015 9.
And there are no further discussions on the re-brightened pe ak
in SDSS J0159 in the manuscript.
Besides, as the shown and discussed results of the reported
optical TDEs candidates in Mockler et al. (2019);Gezari
(2021);van Velzen et al. (2021), time durations about hun-
dreds of days in rest frame can be found at 10% of the peak of
the TDE expected light curves, quite smaller than the corre-
sponding time duration of about 1900days at 10% of the peak
of the light curves of the SDSS J0159 in the rest frame (with
redshift z=0.312 accepted). Actually, the longer time dura -
tion in SDSS J0159 can be naturally explained by the scaled
relation in equation (6) with diﬀerent BH mass and stellar
mass. As an example, among the reported optical TDEs
candidates shown in Mockler et al. (2019), the PTF09ge has
time duration about /u1D447/u1D443∼160/u1D451/u1D44E/u1D466/u1D460 at 10% (2.5magnitudes
weaker than the peak magnitude) of the peak of its light
curves in the rest frame. The PTF09ge is collected, mainly
due to more clearer and smoother optical light curves with
larger variability amplitudes shown in Fig. 1 in Mockler et al.
(2019). To collect one another TDE candidate can lead to
similar results. Considering PTF09ge with MOSFIT deter-
mined BH mass about /u1D440/u1D435/u1D43B,/u1D443∼3.6×106M⊙and stellar
mass about /u1D440★, /u1D443∼0.1M⊙(corresponding stellar radius
about/u1D445★, /u1D443∼0.12R⊙) and/u1D6FD/u1D443∼1.1 and/u1D6FE/u1D443=5/3 listed
inMockler et al. (2019), the expected time duration /u1D447/u1D446of theTDE expected light curve in SDSS J0159 can be estimated as
/u1D447/u1D446∼/u1D447/u1D443(/u1D440/u1D435/u1D43B,/u1D446
/u1D440/u1D435/u1D43B, /u1D443)0.5(/u1D440★, /u1D446
/u1D440★, /u1D443)−1(/u1D445★, /u1D446
/u1D445★, /u1D443)1.5/u1D446/u1D6FD(13)
with/u1D446/u1D6FDas the parameter considering eﬀects of diﬀerent
/u1D6FDapplied in PTF09ge ( /u1D6FD/u1D443∼1.1) and in SDSS J0159
(/u1D6FD/u1D446∼1.94). Then, based on the determined parameters listed
in Table 1 for SDSS J0159 with /u1D6FE/u1D446=5/3, the central BH
mass and stellar parameters are about /u1D440/u1D435/u1D43B,/u1D446∼3.4×106M⊙
and/u1D440★, /u1D446∼1.93M⊙(corresponding stellar radius about
/u1D445★, /u1D446∼1.51R⊙). Meanwhile, based on light curves of
the created standard templates of time-dependent viscous-
delayed accretion rates with /u1D6FE=5/3 and/u1D440/u1D435/u1D43B=106M⊙and
/u1D440★=1M⊙, time duration at 10% of the peak of the light
curve of the viscous-delayed accretion rate with /u1D6FD=1.94 and
log(/u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D460∼ −0.074)(the values for the SDSS J0159) is about
1280days, about 4.7 times longer than the corresponding tim e
duration about 280days with /u1D6FD=1.1 and log (/u1D447/u1D463/u1D456/u1D460∼ −1.4)
(the values for the PTF09ge), leading to /u1D446/u1D6FD∼4.6. Then,
based on the parameters for PTF09ge and for SDSS J0159,
we can have
/u1D447/u1D446∼160(3.4
3.6)0.5(0.1
1.93) (1.51
0.12)1.54.6∼1700days (14)
very similar as the time duration 1900days at 10% of the peak
of the TDE expected ﬂare in the SDSS J0159. The results
strongly indicate that the longer time durations of the TDE
expected ﬂare in SDSS J0159 are reasonable.
Last but not the least, as discussed in Merloni et al. (2015),
there are expected AGN activities through applications of
narrow emission line ﬂux ratios (see their Fig. 3). There-
fore, the central TDE in SDSS J0159 is a central TDE in
AGN host galaxy, quiet diﬀerent from the vast majority of
the reported optical TDEs candidates in quiescent galaxies .
Actually, there are so-far only hands of TDEs candidates re-
ported in AGN host galaxies. Blanchard et al. (2017) have
reported a TDE candidate in a narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy
of which light curves can be roughly described by theoret-
ical TDE model. Yan & Xie (2018) have shown the TDE
expected variability pattern in the low-luminosity AGN NGC
7213. Liu et al. (2020) have reported a TDE candidate in
AGN SDSS J0227. Frederick et al. (2021) have reported
TDEs candidates in narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies. More
recently, Zhang et al. (2022) have shown the TDE expected
variability patterns in a narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy. Mean -
while, Chan et al. (2019,2020) have modeled TDEs variabili-
ties in AGN with a pre-existing accretion disc, and shown tha t
about 20days-long plateau could be expected around central
BH with masses around 106−7M⊙. Therefore, considering
variability properties of the detected optical TDEs candid ates
in AGN host galaxy reported in the literature, TDE expected
variability patterns can also be expected in SDSS J0159. Eve nBH /m.pc/a.pc/s.pc/s.pc /i.pc/n.pc SDSS J0159 11
considering the 20days-long plateau feature by simulating re-
sults in Chan et al. (2020), the plateau has few eﬀects on the
long-term variabilities of SDSS J0159, because the time du-
ration about 1900days of the light-curves of SDSS J0159 is
quite larger than 20days. In one word, the expected cen-
tral TDE in SDSS J0159 is in AGN host galaxy, but TDE
described variability patterns can be well expected in SDSS
J0159.
5.WHETHER THE LONG-TERM VARIABILITIES ARE
RELATED TO CENTRAL AGN ACTIVITIES IN SDSS
J0159?
The results and discussions above are mainly based on the
fundamental point that the long-term variabilities are rel ated
to a central TDE in SDSS J0159. Therefore, it is neces-
sary and interesting to check probability of AGN activities
applied to well describe the long-term variabilities in SDS S
J0159. Here, in order to compare variability properties be-
tween SDSS J0159 and the other normal quasars in the liter-
ature MacLeod et al. (2010), rather than the luminosity light
curve but the photometric light curve is mainly discussed in
the section.
The known Continuous AutoRegressive (CAR) process
and/or the improved Damped Random Walk (DRW) pro-
cess can be applied to describe intrinsic AGN activities, as
well discussed in Kelly, Bechtold & Siemiginowska (2009);
Kozlowski et al. (2010);MacLeod et al. (2010);Zu et al.
(2013,2016);Zhang & Feng (2017);Moreno et al. (2019);
Sheng, Ross & Nicholl (2022). Here, based on the DRW
process, the collected photometric /u1D454-band light curve
from Stripe82 database ( Bramich et al. 2008 ;Thanjavur et al.
2021) can be described by the public code JAVELIN (Just An-
other Vehicle for Estimating Lags In Nuclei) ( Kozlowski et al.
2010;Zu et al. 2013 ), with two process parameters of intrin-
sic characteristic variability amplitude and timescale of /u1D70E
and/u1D70F. The best descriptions are shown in left panel of Fig. 6.
And corresponding MCMC technique determined two di-
mensional posterior distributions of /u1D70Eand/u1D70Fare shown in
right panel of Fig. 6, with the determined log (/u1D70F//u1D451/u1D44E/u1D466/u1D460) ∼
2.92±0.21 and log (/u1D70E/(/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D454//u1D451/u1D44E/u1D466/u1D4600.5)) ∼ − 0.55±0.10,
leading/u1D446/u1D439∞//u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D454∼/u1D70E/(/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D454//u1D451/u1D44E/u1D466/u1D4600.5) ×/radicalbig
/u1D70F//u1D451/u1D44E/u1D466/u1D460 to be
about log (/u1D446/u1D439∞//u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D454) ∼ 0.85 in SDSS J0159. Actually,
to collect the photometric /u1D462/u1D45F/u1D456-band light curves can lead to
similar results. Meanwhile, as discussed in MacLeod et al.
(2010) for SDSS normal quasars in Stripe82 database, normal
SDSS quasars have mean values of log (/u1D70F//u1D451/u1D44E/u1D466/u1D460) ∼2.4 and
log(/u1D446/u1D439∞//u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D454) ∼ − 0.7. Therefore, in the space /u1D459/u1D45C/u1D454(/u1D70F)ver-
sus log(/u1D446/u1D439∞), SDSS J0159 is an outlier among the quasars,
due to its log (/u1D446/u1D439∞//u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D454)about 1.5magnitudes larger than the
normal quasars. In other words, although the SDSS J0159 has
its light curves with longer time durations, SDSS J0159 hasunique variability properties, quite diﬀerent from the nor mal
SDSS quasars.
Moreover, besides the discussions in the section to show
unique variability properties in SDSS J0159, two additiona l
points can be found. First, the ﬁrst data point at MJD-
50200=880 is apparently 0.3magnitudes brighter than the da ta
points with MJD-50200 later than 4000, which can be applied
as one another evidence to support that the ﬁrst data point at
MJD-50200=880 in Fig. 2is not one data point similar as the
other data points at late times, but one data point related to
the central TDE, under the assumed TDE to explain variabil-
ities of SDSS J0159, similar as discussed results in Section
4. Second, although there are unique variability propertie s
in SDSS J0159 quite diﬀerent from normal quasars, contri-
butions of central AGN activities to the light curves cannot
be totally ruled out, such as the shown weak AGN activities
in eBOSS spectrum of SDSS J0159. Therefore, it is neces-
sary to discuss eﬀects of central AGN activities on our ﬁnal
results. Besides the ﬁtting procedure discussed in Section
3, ﬁve additional model parameters are added to described
AGN contributions to the light curves, i.e., the equation (8 )
in Section 3 is re-written to
/u1D43F/u1D462, /u1D454, /u1D45F, /u1D456, /u1D467 (/u1D461)=/uni222B.dsp
/u1D706/u1D462, /u1D454, /u1D45F, /u1D456, /u1D467/u1D453/u1D706(/u1D461)/u1D451/u1D706×4/u1D70B×/u1D437/u1D456/u1D4602
+/u1D43F0/u1D462, /u1D454, /u1D45F, /u1D456, /u1D467
(15)
with/u1D43F0/u1D462, /u1D454, /u1D45F, /u1D456, /u1D467 >0 as the AGN contributions. Then, the
theoretical TDE model with 12 model parameters are ap-
plied to re-describe the /u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456/u1D467 -band luminosity light curves
shown in Fig. 2through the Levenberg-Marquardt least-
squares minimization technique, leading to the parameters
/u1D43F0/u1D462, /u1D454, /u1D45F, /u1D456, /u1D467 ∼0 and similar BH masses as discussed in
Section 4, because the data points at late times have lumi-
nosities around zero as shown in Table 2 in Merloni et al.
(2015). If parameters of /u1D43F0/u1D462, /u1D454, /u1D45F, /u1D456, /u1D467 are not constant values
but time-dependent, corresponding ﬁtting results to /u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F-band
luminosity light curves could lead to stronger luminositie s at
data points earlier than MJD-50200=880, quite brighter tha n
the data points from POSSII shown in Fig. 1 in Merloni et al.
(2015). Therefore, even there are weak AGN activities, they
have few eﬀects on our ﬁnal results through applications of
theoretical TDE model in the manuscript.
6.MAIN SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Finally, we give our main summary and conclusions as
follows.
•Host galaxy spectroscopic features are measured by the
simple SSP method applied with 350 stellar templates,
to conﬁrm the low total stellar mass of SDSS J0159,
through the whole spectroscopic absorption features
within rest wavelength range from 3650Å to 7700Å.12 Z/h.pc/a.pc/n.pc/g.pc X/u.pc/e.pcG/u.pc/a.pc/n.pc/g.pc
Figure 6. Left panel shows the JAVELIN code determined best descripti ons to the long-term photometric /u1D454-band (solid circles plus error bars
in blue) light curve of SDSS J0159. Solid blue line and area ﬁl led in pink show the best descriptions and corresponding 1 /u1D70Econﬁdence bands to
the/u1D454-band luminosity light curve. Right panel shows the MCMC tec hnique determined two-dimensional posterior distributio ns in contour of
ln(/u1D70F//u1D451/u1D44E/u1D466/u1D460)and ln(/u1D70E/(/u1D45A/u1D44E/u1D454//u1D451/u1D44E/u1D466/u1D4600.5)), with solid circle plus error bars in red showing the accepte d values and 1 /u1D70Euncertainties of ln (/u1D70F)and
ln(/u1D70E).
•Theoretical TDE model can be well applied to describe
the/u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456/u1D467 -band variabilities of SDSS J1059, leading the
central BH mass to be about /u1D440/u1D435/u1D43B∼4.5+1.3
−1.1×106M⊙,
two magnitudes smaller than the virial BH mass in
SDSS J0159.
•Through CAR/DRW process applied to describe long-
term light curves of SDSS J0159,comparing variability
properties between SDSS J0159 and the normal SDSS
quasars in Stripe82 database, SDSS J0159 is an outlier
in the space of the process parameter of intrinsic vari-
ability timescale /u1D70Fversus intrinsic variability ampli-
tude/u1D70E, indicating SDSS J0159 has unique variability
properties, quite diﬀerent from the normal quasars.
•Theoretical TDE model with the model parameter of
central BH mass limited to be higher than 108M⊙can-
not lead to reasonable descriptions to the SDSS /u1D462/u1D454/u1D45F/u1D456-
band variabilities of SDSS J1059, indicating central
BH mass higher than 108M⊙is not preferred in SDSS
J0159.
•The TDE model determine central BH mass is well
consistent with the M-sigma relation expected value
through the measured stellar velocity dispersion in
SDSS J0159.•The outliers in the space of virial BH masses versus
stellar velocity dispersions could be better candidates
of TDEs.
