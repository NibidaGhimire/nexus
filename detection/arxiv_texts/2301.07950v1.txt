or broadening of the mode resonances.[12] 
With such approach, detection of indi-vidual cells,
[13,14] viruses,[15] protein mole-
cules,[16] DNA,[17,18] and nanoparticles[19,20] 
has already been achieved. Further enhancement of the performances of a 
WGM-based sensor can be obtained in an 
active cavity, where the monolithic integra-tion of a laser provides higher stability and improved frequency resolution.
[21,22] Such 
platforms hold great promise also for appli-cations in the field of gas sensing, how-
ever, the materials used in conventional 
WGM microcavities (silica or metal fluorides) are inert and thus 
unsuitable for gas adsorption and tracing. On the other hand, the hybridization of 2D materials with microcavities, such as 
chip microrings,
[23–25] plasmonic resonators,[26,27] nanowires,[28] 
fiber microcavities,[29,30] and WGM microresonators,[31–33] offers 
a new route for enhanced photon–electron interactions and thus 
provides a novel platform for gas detection.[34]
Here we realize an active WGM microsphere laser device 
functionalized with single-layer graphene that is capable of Optical-microcavity-enhanced light–matter interaction offers a powerful tool 
to develop fast and precise sensing techniques, spurring applications in the 
detection of biochemical targets ranging from cells, nanoparticles, and large 
molecules. However, the intrinsic inertness of such pristine microresonators limits their spread in new fields such as gas detection. Here, a functionalized 
microlaser sensor is realized by depositing graphene in an erbium-doped 
over-modal microsphere. By using a 980 nm pump, multiple laser lines excited in different mode families of the microresonator are co-generated in a 
single device. The interference between these splitting mode lasers produce 
beat notes in the electrical domain (0.2–1.1 MHz) with sub-kHz accuracy, thanks to the graphene-induced intracavity backward scattering. This allows 
for lab-free multispecies gas identification from a mixture, and ultrasensitive 
gas detection down to individual molecule.ReseaRch aR ticle
 
1. Introduction
In the past two decades, whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) 
optical microresonators have attracted enormous interests, owing to their unique high quality factors (Q ) and small mode 
volumes.
[1–3] The enhanced light–matter interactions in a WGM 
microcavity enable the development of microlasers, micro-sensors, and microspectrometers.
[4–9] In particular, WGM 
microcavities offer unique advantages when applied to the fields

distinguish CO 2, NH 3, NO 2, and H 2O molecules in a mixture) 
with high sensitivity (i.e., individual molecule). Thanks to the over-modal nature of our device, we successfully generate mul-
tiple laser modes in one single device. By depositing graphene 
20° away from the equator, we make it interact with the higher order modes of the laser microcavity, while avoiding thermal damage. The backward scattering induced by the graphene 
monolayer induces symmetry breaking and mode splitting
[35] 
at specific frequencies, which can be precisely measured via 
optoelectronic heterodyne beating. In addition, gas molecule 
adsorption on graphene changes its Fermi level,[36,37] and thus 
modifies the effective permittivity of the cavity[38] leading to tens of kHz/ppb changes in the mode splitting. From this, we can precisely measure the presence of various gases in a mix-
ture with high precision, discrimination, and sensitivity.
2. Results
Figure 1a shows the conceptual design of our graphene-based 
microlaser sensor (GMLS). A silica microsphere with diameter of ≈600  µm is doped with erbium by using the solution coating 
and the discharge sintering technology,
[39] leading to an effec-
tive erbium concentration >1018 cm−3. Subsequently, we deposit 
a mechanically exfoliated graphene flake by deterministic

the light–material interaction with high order modes while avoiding heating damage. Next, when we launch a 980  nm 
pump laser into the microcavity via a tapered fiber, we obtain 
a counter-propagating laser with splitting frequencies. In this configuration, gas adsorption on the graphene will change the permittivity of the device and thus modify the splitting offsets. 
More details about the operating principle of our device are dis-
cussed in Note S1, Supporting Information. Figure  1b shows the side-view microscopic picture of our device and a zoomed-in image where the 30  ×  60 µm
2  graphene layer is clearly vis-
ible. In comparison to erbium-doped silica (i.e., the material of the microcavity), graphene has a higher refractive index and 
its dimensions on the sphere are much larger compared to the 
optical wavelength, thus enabling strong backward scattering for the mode splitting formation. More details about the device nanofabrication, graphene transfer, and material characteriza-
tion are available in the Note S2, Supporting Information. In 
Figure  1c, we schematically depict the sensing mechanism of our device. First, due to the presence of graphene and its induced backward scattering, some modes of the laser cavity will split, forming a pair of symmetric and asymmetric 
standing waves with splitting offset δ. Then, the adsorption 
of gas molecules on graphene will change its permittivity and 
thus shift the mode splitting from δ to δ′, which can be eventu-ally precisely measured by heterodyne detection in the radio-
frequency domain.
Figure  1d plots the passive transmission spectrum of our 
graphene-based microresonator. In one single free-spectral-
range (100  GHz), there are 517  resonances. Before graphene deposition, the typical Q factor of the erbium-doped micro-
sphere at its fundamental mode (TM
01) is ≈8  ×  107. After gra-
phene deposition, the average Q factor decreases by ≈12%, 
which is still enough for lasing with approximately tens of µW 
pump power. By sending the pump power for loss compensa-
tion but still remaining below the laser threshold (e.g., 15  µW), 
we can measure the cavity transmission with narrower reso-nances and thus get more insights into the mode splittings.
[22,40] 
We find that several splitting modes appear after the deposition of graphene, such as modes A–D, located at 1535.46, 1536.59, 
1534.89, and 1535.82  nm. Figure  1e shows the four selected 
splitting modes (A–D), with splitting offset δ of 232, 780, 411, 
and 1100  kHz, respectively. We note that the splitting offsets of our device are smaller than many WGM microcavities from 
previous publications,
[10,22] mainly because the geometric size 
(or mode volume) of our microsphere is larger. The observed 
kHz splitting offset is also an evidence that the double reso-
nances are caused by mode splitting rather than mode crossing. 
In Note S3, Supporting Information, we provide more details about the splitting resonances and their temporal traces. We also note that mode splitting in this microsphere resonator can 
be induced by other scatterers (such as inhomogeneous erbium 
doping or scattering points inside the spherical cavity). We can observe these splitting modes before the graphene deposition, but they are insensitive to gas molecules (see Notes S2 and S3, Supporting Information).
Figure 2a shows the lasing behavior of our GMLS device. 
By increasing the 980  nm pump laser power, different laser lines are gradually excited in the communication band around 1535  nm. The lasing threshold of this device (after deposition of graphene) is 16  µW, and the lasing efficiency is ≈1%. While 
increasing the pump power, we track in particular four states (i–iv in Figure  2), which correspond to the formation of the laser modes A–D. Figure  2b plots the optical spectra of these four states and Figure 2c plots the radio frequency spectra (i.e., 
the splitting offset) of the four states: the modes A–D (states 
i–iv) have central wavelengths of 1535.462, 1536.614, 1534.913, and 1535.826 nm and they have splitting offsets of 231.8, 780.4, 411.5, and 1100 kHz, respectively. All these laser modes are in agreement with the transmission measurement, as the intra-
cavity laser induced heating is very low, and we use a thermo-
electrical-cooler (TEC) for temperature stabilization. We also note that additional laser modes can be obtained by tuning the pump polarization (see Note S3, Supporting Information). In 
the following we will focus only on modes A–D.
Figure  2d shows a further characterization of the four beat 
notes for a pump power of 40  µW. For the laser modes A–D, 
we observe signal to noise ratios (SNR) of 43, 31, 18, and 23 dB, 
and linewidths of 76, 107, 115, and 183 Hz, respectively. These 
values of the SNR and linewidths allow to achieve high energy 
and frequency resolution for gas sensing applications far beyond the typical performances of passive devices. We also measure the spectral uncertainties of the four modes, and plot 
them in Figure  2e. For measurements up to 5  min, the max-
imum drifting of modes A–D is ±510, ±645, ±390, and ±870 Hz, 
respectively. Thus, for the gas sensing application that we dis-cuss in the following, we will refer to the largest measured instability of each mode for an estimate of the detection limit.
Next, we demonstrate the performances of our device for gas 
sensing applications (Figure 3). First, we schematically reiterate 
the sensing mechanism in Figure 3a: the out-of-plane π bonds in graphene are highly sensitive to polar gases.
[41,42] When 
adsorbed on graphene, gases such as NO 2  and H 2O act as 
electron acceptors, whereas gases such as NH 3 and CO 2 act as 
electron donors.[36,43] Thus, starting from our originally p-doped 
graphene on silica (E F ≈  0.2  eV, as obtained from Raman 
spectroscopy shown in Note S2, Supporting Information),[45] 
NO 2 and H 2O adsorption will increase the |EF|, while vice versa 
the NH 3 and CO 2 adsorption will decrease the |E F|. In the Sup-
porting Information, we also confirm the electrical response of a graphene device when exposed to such gases.
[44]
Figure 3b shows the calculated permittivity of graphene, as a 
function of both |E F| and the optical wavelength. In our experi-
ment, we start from |E F| ≈ 0.2  eV and wavelength ≈1535  nm.

(decrement) of ε g enables an increase (decrease) of the beating 
frequency of a splitting mode. Figure 3c shows a sketch of our 
experimental setup. A 980 nm laser diode drives the GMLS. In 
front of the device (gas sensor), a fiber polarization controller is 
used to optimize the mode excitation and an isolator is used to avoid back-scattering of light inside the pump laser. The GMLS is fixed in a gas chamber with in–out gas channels and a TEC is 
connected to the microcavity for thermal stabilization. We use 
a tapered fiber to inject and collect optical signals. In order to optimize the effect of pumping, the microcavity works in the over-coupling region. Then we use a WDM to filter out the laser lines and thus to obtain higher SNR. Finally, the laser lines are 
measured by using an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) and an electrical spectrum analyzer (ESA). For the detection of low concentrations of gases in a mixture, we mainly trace the spec-
tral shifts of the laser beat notes in the ESA.
The measured beating frequency shifts induced by CO
2, 
NH 3, NO 2, and H 2O in modes A–D as a function of gas concen-
tration are shown in Figure 3d (see also the spectra in Note S3, Supporting Information). For instance, when increasing the 
CO
2  concentration from 0  to 1000  ppb, the frequency of the 
beat notes of the four selected modes (A–D) decreases by 11, 
20.4, 16, and 26.8 kHz; while when increasing the NO 2 concen-
tration from 0  to 1000  ppb, the beat notes increase by 14, 33, 18, and 63  kHz. Considering the abovementioned frequency 
uncertainties of the four selected beat notes, we can estimate 
the detection limit of the four gases in our device to be 0.5,

as shown in Figure 3e. The lower sensitivity to H 2O compared 
to the other gases may be due to the loose molecular binding 
of H 2O and graphene.[36] The different sensitivity coefficients, 
obtained from a logarithmic fit of the curves in Figure  3d, allow to simultaneously detect different beating frequencies, 
and thus to identify different gases in a mixture. Thus, in 
order to identify the four investigated gases in a mixture with high selectivity, we simply need to solve the system of linear Equation (2):

where CCO2, CNH3, CNO2, and CHO2 are the different gas 
concentrations.
In Figure 3f, we further demonstrate the recoverability of the 
GMLS. First we confirm that the mode responses are insensi-
tive to dry N 2: when the concentration of dry N 2  changes by 
±1 ppm, splitting frequencies keep unchanged. Then, by peri-odically injecting 1  ppm target gas and dry N
2, we monitor 
the frequency shifts of the beat notes. We use the gas syringe with a fixed injecting speed. Every 10  min period, the gas is 
injected in for 60 s, we keep the chamber stable for 240 s (tem-
perature 300 K), and then slowly discharge the gas in 300–360 s by injecting dry N
2. Finally we keep the chamber stable again 
until 600 s. For each gas sample, our device demonstrates high recoverability (almost 100%). As shown in Figure 3g, when the gas concentration is stable, both the response delay and the 
recovery delay are in the single minute level. The response/
recovery time of our device depends mainly on three factors: the gas concentration (N), the ambient temperature (T), and the bonding efficiency (ξ), which is defined by the gas kinetic theory.
[46] The average frequency of gas adsorption on the gra-
phene surface is F  = Aξ(N/4)(8k BT/πm)1/2 (unit: molecules/s), 
where A is the area of the graphene, N is the gas concentra-
tion, kB is the Boltzmann’s constant, and m is the gas molecular 
mass.[47] The ξ would decrease to 0  when the gas adsorption 
approaches saturation. We thus expect that a higher injected gas concentration (N) or a higher temperature (T) can both 
contribute to accelerate the response/recovery time (see also 
Note S3, Supporting Information, for details).
Moreover, this scheme using multiple laser modes allows 
us to quantitatively measure the concentrations of the four 
gases in the mixture via solving the linear equations. As a 
proof of concept, we use the device to detect four different gas mixtures (consisting of CO
2, NH 3, NO 2,  and H 2O) with com-
ponent ratios: (i) 1:0.1:0.1:0.1, (ii) 0.1:1:0.1:0.1, (iii) 0.1:0.1:1:0.1, and (iv) 0.1:0.1:0.1:1 in ppm scale (gray columns) and we meas-
ured: (i) 0.93:0.105:0.11:0.12, (ii) 0.088:1.11:0.109:0.093, (iii) 
0.085:0.113:0.92:0.11, and (iv) 0.11:0.12:0.13:0.89 (red columns). The statistic error could be further reduced via repeated meas-urements (Figure 4a,b). Besides simultaneously measuring four 
gas samples, our GMLS is also capable to quantitatively detect mixtures with two or three gas species. For three gas mixtures, we flexibly mix CO
2/NH 3/NO 2, CO 2/NH 3/H2O, CO 2/NO 2/
H2O, and NH 3/NO 2/H2O, and we obtain accurate results (with 
detection error <7%) by detecting the shifts of three laser modes (e.g., B–D), as shown in Figure 4c,d. The same can be done for 
gas mixtures containing two different gases (Figure  4e,f): in 
this case only two laser modes are necessary (e.g., B and D) and the average error in the double-gas detection is <5%.
Moreover, the sub-ppb sensitivity of our device points toward 
the possibility of measuring individual molecule dynamics. The size of the transferred graphene flake (≈1.5  × 10
−9 m2) is much 
smaller than the gas chamber (8  × 10−3 m3), and we thus esti-
mate that there are <1000 gas molecules per second interacting with the graphene sheet when the gas concentration is <1 ppb. 
To trace the individual molecular dynamics, we build a lock-in amplification setup,
[17,34] as shown in Figure 5a. Here, we select 
the laser mode D by using an optical filter (FWHM 0.1  nm). After a photodetection, the beat note of mode D is mixed with 
a stable electrical signal for further frequency down conversion. 
This step is needed to reach a frequency (<100  kHz) that can be detected by our lock-in amplifier. Finally, we send the mixed signal (f
mix = 78 kHz) to the lock-in amplifier and set the lock-in 
bandwidth to 100 Hz. Figure 5b plots the fmix signal before and 
after injecting 0.1 ppb of NO 2 gas into the chamber (originally 
filled with pure N 2). The gas adsorption induces a beating fre-
quency shift, and thus the amplitude decreases at the frequency detected by the lock-in.
Such intensity changes are monitored in an oscilloscope 
(Figure 5c). In the 0–5 s (blue region), the sensor is exposed to pure N
2, while in the 5–15  s (orange region), the sensor 
is exposed to pure N 2 + 1  ppb NO 2. The intensity resolu-
tion in this measurement is ± 8.33  µV. When the chamber 
is filled with N 2, the lock-in trace is flat. In contrast, with 
1  ppb NO 2  the intensity of the lock-in signal is dynamically 
modulated around an average value of 0.8  mV, due to indi-vidual molecule NO
2–graphene interactions. In Figure 5d, we 
zoom-in these temporal dynamics and compare the two states i (pure N
2,) and ii (1 ppb NO 2). The minimum step height in 
state ii is ± 50 µV, and the height of any other step is an integer 
multiple of this value, supporting the hypothesis that we are 
detecting individual molecule dynamics. We thus measured 
the distribution of 200  different steps in state ii and found that the statistics follows a power law (Figure 5e), as expected in the case of individual molecule adsorption and desorption 
events.
[34,37]
3. Discussion
We have shown that our graphene microlaser sensor holds 
great potential for multispecies gas detection with compact size and low power consumption. However, before a transi-
tion from lab to fab, there are still few foreseeable challenges: 
1) the gas detection relies on the specifications of each device, which should thus be calibrated before use; 2) this sensor can only quantitatively measure the identified (calibrated) gas 
mixtures. To address these issues, we suggest the following 
schemes: 1) characterize and fix a set of fabrication parame-ters (such as standardized graphene size/location and WGM 
cavity para meters); 2) fix the fiber–cavity coupling to optimize 
the nanofabrication as consistent as possible.
[34] Moreover, 
each sensor could be pre-inspected by using artificial intel-
ligence methods.[48] In the Note S3, Supporting Information, 
we demonstrate that we can fabricate several devices with controlled size and position of the exfoliated graphene flake. 
Moreover, we show a plug and play elementary prototype of 
our GMLS. In addition, for the detection of additional gases (more than only the four presented here), one could simply boost the laser power and excite more splitting laser modes. 
This will lead to a more complex demodulation scheme, which 
could be addressed by future and more advanced optical signal processing.

of multiple-splitting-mode lasers in a graphene-based active 
microresonator, offering an all-optical sensor for multispecies 
gas detection with sub-ppb sensitivity. By placing a single layer 
graphene 20°  away from the equator of the microresonator, we 
found and measured laser splitting offsets that are extremely 
sensitive to adsorption of polar gases on graphene. The beating 
signals of such frequency offsets can be conveniently meas-ured in the RF spectrum. By leveraging the narrow and stable linewidths of our laser device, we achieved sub-kHz spectral 
resolution and the consequent gas identification at the ppb 
level concentration. Moreover, the presence of multiple beats in one single device allows for the identification of different gases in a mixture. This scheme offers a label-free optical tool to realize both qualitative and quantitative gas molecule detec-
tion, with compact size, low power consumption, and simple 
operation.4. Experimental Section
Theoretical Analysis: In a whispering-gallery-mode microcavity, each 
travelling mode contained a pair of counter-propagating waves with 
degenerate frequency. An intracavity back scattering could break this degeneracy and form a mode splitting, described by the Heisenberg equation.
[35] Such mode splitting depended on the permittivity of the 
scatterer (graphene in this work). In Note S1, Supporting Information, the physics behind the mode splitting, its effect on the laser, and the mechanism of the graphene-based optical gas sensing are discussed.
Nanofabrication of the Graphene/Erbium–Silica Microresonator: The 
active microsphere samples were fabricated with the arc-discharge technique in a fiber fusion splicer (FITEL S178), and the erbium ions were introduced via the solution coating and the discharge sintering technology. By optimizing the fabrication parameters, uniform microspheres with diameter of 600  µm and surface erbium doping rate 
10
18  cm−3 were obtained. High-quality crystalline single layer graphene 
nanosheets were dry transferred onto the microsphere samples with the PDMS stamping method. In Note S2, Supporting Information, details of the nanofabrication process and the related characterization are shown.

reagent bottles were purchased. First, the gases were extracted by using 
quantitative syringes (Max range: 1  mL, ruler 0.1  µL). By repeatedly 
diluting and mixing the gas samples in dry N 2, the minimum injecting gas 
(0.1 µL, 1 ppm) could be controlled. In the experiment, the volume of the 
gas chamber with sealed fiber in–out channels was 8 L. The diluted gases were injected through a port connected with the interior of the closed gas chamber. The original filling gas in the chamber was pure N
2  at room 
temperature under the standard atmospheric pressure. Since the injected gas volume was much smaller than the gas chamber volume, the gas pressure change was negligible. In Note S3, Supporting Information, more details about the gas sensing measurements are shown.

dynamics. b) The f mix signal shifts to the right when injecting 0.1 ppb of NO 2 into the chamber. Such spectral shift causes an intensity increment at 
the lock-in frequency. c) Temporal trace of the lock-in output. Here state i marks the response in pure N 2, while state ii marks the response in 1ppb 
NO 2. d) Zoomed in traces from (c). Here the blue trace and the red trace show the device response in pure N 2 and in 1 ppb NO 2, respectively. A single
