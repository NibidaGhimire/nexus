1.Introduction
We discuss moduli of vector bundles on those noncommutative local Calabi–Yau threefolds that
occur in noncommutative crepant resolutions of the general ised conifolds xy−znwm= 0. Such
crepant resolutions require lines of type ( −1,−1) and ( −2,0), that is, those locally modelled by
W1:= Tot( OP1(−1)⊕ OP1(−1)) or W2:= Tot( OP1(−2)⊕ OP1(0)).
Their appearance is balanced in a precise sense described in [GKMR ] so that no particular
conﬁguration of such lines is more likely to occur in a crepan t resolution than any other.
Our results show that the structure of the quantum moduli spa ce (Def. 4.3) of vector bundles
over a noncommutative deformation varies drastically depe nding on the choice of a Poisson
structure.
In the 2-dimensional case, [ BG] described the geometry of noncommutative deformations of the
local surfaces Zk:= Tot( OP1(−k)), showing that the quantum moduli space of instantons over
a noncommutative deformation ( Zk, σ) can be viewed as the ´ etale space of a constructible sheaf
over the classical moduli space of instantons on Zk. While in 2 dimensions vector bundles occur
as mathematical representations of instantons, in the 3-di mensional case vector bundles occur
as mathematical descriptions of BPS states, with W1andW2appearing as building blocks, as
described in [ GKMR ,GSTV ,OSY].
1QUANTIZATION OF CALABI–YAU THREEFOLDS 2
In this work, we describe the geometry of noncommutative def ormations Wof a Calabi–Yau
threefold W, showing that the quantum moduli space of vector bundles on t ogether with the
map taking a vector bundle on Wto its classical limit
M/planckover2pi1
j(W, σ)
Mj(W)
has the structure of a constructible sheaf, whose rank and si ngularity set depend explicitly on
the choice of noncommutative deformation. In particular, w e describe the geometry of noncom-
mutative deformations of some crepant resolutions. It is at this point yet unclear how these
compare with Van den Bergh’s noncommutative crepant resolu tions [ V].
To each Poisson structure σonWk, with k= 1 or k= 2 there corresponds a noncommutative
deformation ( Wk,Aσ) with Aσ= (O[ [/planckover2pi1] ], ⋆σ) where ⋆σis the star product corresponding to σ. All
of these Poisson structures were described in [ BGKS ] in terms of generators over global functions;
when σis one of such generators, we refer to it as a basic Poisson structure. There exist Poisson
structures for which all brackets vanish on the ﬁrst formal n eighbourhood of P1⊂Wk; we call
them extremal Poisson structures, they behave very diﬀerently from the ba sic ones. Our main
results are:
Theorem (5.4,6.4).Letk= 1 or2. If σis an extremal Poisson structure on Wk, then the
quantum moduli space M/planckover2pi1
j(Wk, σ)can be viewed as the ´ etale space of a constructible sheaf Ekof
generic rank 2j−k−1over the classical moduli space Mj(Wk)with singular stalks of all ranks
up to 4j−k−4.
Ifσ′is another Poisson structure on Wk, then the corresponding sheaf E′
kis a subsheaf of Ek,
with the smallest possible sheaf occurring for basic Poisso n structures.
Theorem (5.2,6.2).Letk= 1or2. Ifσis a basic Poisson structure on Wk, then the quantum
moduli space M/planckover2pi1
j(Wk, σ)and its classical limit are isomorphic:
M/planckover2pi1
j(Wk, σ)≃Mj(Wk)≃P4j−5.
Therefore, comparing these results, we see that the choice o f Poisson structure has a strong
inﬂuence on the geometry of the quantum moduli space.
2.Noncommutative deformations
Aholomorphic Poisson structure on a complex manifold (or smooth complex algebraic variety)
Xis given by a holomorphic bivector ﬁeld σ∈H0(X,Λ2TX) whose Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket
[σ, σ]∈H0(X,Λ3TX) is zero. The associated Poisson bracket is then given by the pairing /an}bracketle{t ·,· /an}bracketri}ht
between vector ﬁelds and forms {f, g}σ=/an}bracketle{tσ,df∧dg/an}bracketri}ht.
To obtain a noncommutative deformation of Xone must ﬁrst promote the Poisson structure to
a
star product onX, that is, a C[ [/planckover2pi1] ]-bilinear associative product ⋆:OX[ [/planckover2pi1] ]× O X[ [/planckover2pi1] ]→ O X[ [/planckover2pi1] ]
which is of the form f ⋆ g =fg+/summationtext∞
n=1Bn(f, g)/planckover2pi1nwhere the Bnare bidiﬀerential operators.
The pair ( X, ⋆ σ) is called a deformation quantization of (X, σ) when the star product on X
satisﬁes B1(f, g) ={f, g}σ.
For a holomorphic Poisson manifold ( X, σ) with associated Poisson bracket { ·,· }σ, the sheaf
of formal functions with holomorphic coeﬃcients on the quan tization (X, ⋆ σ) is
Aσ:= (O[ [/planckover2pi1] ], ⋆σ).QUANTIZATION OF CALABI–YAU THREEFOLDS 3
We call Wk(σ) = ( Wk,Aσ) anoncommutative deformation ofWk, and a vector bundle on a
noncommutative deformation is by deﬁnition a locally free s heaf of Aσ-modules. These vector
bundles and their moduli are our objects of study here.
When we work with a ﬁxed Poisson structure, we use the abbrevi ated notations A,{ ·,· }and
⋆. We also use the cut to order nrepresented as A(n)=O[[/planckover2pi1]]//planckover2pi1n+1.
The existence of star products on Poisson manifolds was prov en in the seminal papers of Kontse-
vich [ Ko1,Ko2]. For a complex algebraic variety Xwith structure sheaf OX, if both H1(X,OX)
andH2(X,OX) vanish, then there is a bijection
{Poisson deformations of OX}/∼ ↔ { associative deformations of OX}/∼
where ∼denotes gauge equivalence [ Y, Cor. 11.2]. These cohomological hypothesis are veriﬁed
in the cases of W1andW2(but not for W3, see App. A). We now recall the basic properties of
Poisson structures on Wkork= 1,2.All Poisson structures on Wkmay be described by giving
their generators over global functions. This is a consequen ce of the following result.

onX, then fσis integrable for all f∈ O(X).

{z,u1,u2}and V=C3
{ξ,v1,v2}
by the relation
(ξ, v1, v2) = ( z−1, zku1, z−k+2u2).
All Poisson structures on W1can be obtained using the following generators [ BGKS , Thm. 3.2]
σ1=∂z∧∂u1, σ 2=∂z∧∂u2,
σ3=u1∂u1∧∂u2−z∂z∧∂u2, σ 4=u2∂u1∧∂u2+z∂z∧∂u1.
TheW1-Poisson structures σ1, σ2, σ3, σ4are pairwise isomorphic.
All Poisson structures on W2can be obtained using the following generators [ BGKS , Lem. 3]
σ1=∂z∧∂u1, σ 2=∂z∧∂u2, σ 3=z∂z∧∂u2,
σ4=u1∂u1∧∂u2, σ 5= 2zu1∂u1∧∂u2−z2∂z∧∂u2.
The W2-Poisson structures σ2andσ5on are isomorphic. Moreover, the Poisson structures
σ1, σ2, σ3, σ4onW2are pairwise inequivalent, giving 4 distinct Poisson manif olds.
3.Vector bundles on noncommutative deformations
To discuss moduli of vector bundles on noncommutative defor mations of Wk, for k= 1 or 2 we
will consider those bundles that are formally algebraic.
Deﬁnition 3.1. We say that p=/summationtextpn/planckover2pi1n∈ O[[/planckover2pi1]] is formally algebraic if pnis a polynomial
for every n. We say that a vector bundle over ( Wk, σ) isformally algebraic if it is isomorphic to
a vector bundle given by formally algebraic transition func tions. In addition, if there exists N
such that pn= 0 for all n > N , we then say that pisalgebraic .
Lemma 3.2. LetAbe a deformation quantization of O. Then an A-module Sis acyclic if and
only if S=S//planckover2pi1Sis acyclic.QUANTIZATION OF CALABI–YAU THREEFOLDS 4
Proof. Consider the short exact sequence
0− → S/planckover2pi1− → S − → S− →0.
It gives, for j >0 surjections
Hj(X,S)/planckover2pi1− →Hj(X,S)− →0.
This immediately implies that Hj(X,S) = 0 for j >0. The converse is immediate. /square
Notation 3.3. LetWkbe a noncommutative deformation of Wk. Denote by A(j) the line
bundle over Wkwith transition function z−j, hence the pull back of O(j) onP1.
Proposition 3.4. Fork= 1,2any line bundle on Wkis isomorphic to A(j)for some j∈Z,
i.e.,Pic(Wk) =Zwhen k= 1,2.
Proof. Letf=f0+/summationtext∞
n=1/tildewidefn/planckover2pi1n∈ A∗(U∩V) be the transition function for the line bundle L.
Then there exist functions a0∈ O∗(U) and α0∈ O∗(V) such that α0f0a0=z−jand viewing

n=1fn/planckover2pi1nfor some
fn∈ O(U∩V). We may thus assume that the transition function of Lisz−j+/summationtext∞
n=1fn/planckover2pi1n.
To give an isomorphism L ≃ A (j) it suﬃces to deﬁne functions an∈ O(U) and αn∈ O(V)
satisfying

Collecting terms by powers of /planckover2pi1, (3.5) is equivalent to the system of equations
Sn+z−jan+z−jαn= 0 n= 1,2, . . .
where Snis a ﬁnite sum involving fi,Bifori≤n, but only ai, αifori < n . The ﬁrst terms are
S1=f1
S2=f2+α1f1+a1f1+B1/parenleftbigα1, z−j/parenrightbig+B1/parenleftbigz−j, a1/parenrightbig+α1z−ja1

+α2f1+α2z−ja1+α1f2+α1f1a1+α1z−ja2+f2a1+f1a2
Since by Lem. A.1we have H1(Wk,O) = 0 when k= 1,2, we can solve these equations recur-
sively, by deﬁning anto cancel out all terms of zjSnhaving positive powers of zand setting
αn=zjSn−an. /square
Note that this is essentially the same proof as [ BG, Prop. 6.7], and it does not work for k≥3,
in fact Pic( W3) is much larger, see Lem. A.3.
We now consider vector bundles of higher rank.
Theorem 3.6. Fork= 1,2, vector bundles over Wk(σ)are ﬁltrable.
Proof. This is a generalisation of Ballico–Gasparim–K¨ oppe [ BGK1 , Thm. 3.2] to the noncom-
mutative case. Let Ebe a sheaf of A-modules. Lem. 3.2gives that the classical limit E0=E//planckover2pi1E
is acyclic as a sheaf of A-modules (and equivalently as a sheaf of O-modules) if and only if Eis
acyclic as a sheaf of A-modules.
Filtrability for a bundle Eover Wk, for k= 1,2 was proved in [ K] and is obtained from the
vanishing of cohomology groups Hi(Wk, E⊗SymnN∗) for i= 1,2, where N∗is the conormalQUANTIZATION OF CALABI–YAU THREEFOLDS 5
bundle of ℓ⊂Wkand n > 0 are integers, the proof proceeds by induction on n. In the
noncommutative case, let Sdenote the kernel of the projection A(n)→ A(n−1). By construction
we have that S//planckover2pi1S= SymnN∗and the required vanishing of cohomologies is guaranteed by
Lem. 3.2. /square
The analogous proof does not work for W3, see [ K, Rem. 3.13]. It is unknown whether bundles
onWkare ﬁltrable when k≥3.
Remark 3.7. There are also some particular features happening only when k= 1. Every
holomorphic vector bundle on W1is algebraic [K, Thm. 3.10] , and W1is formally rigid [GKRS ,
Thm. 11] . In contrast, if k >1, then Wkhas as inﬁnite-dimensional family of deformations. In
particular, a deformation family for W2can be given by (ξ, v1, v2) =/parenleftig
z−1, z2u1+z/summationtext
j>0tjuj
2, u2/parenrightig
[GKRS , Thm. 13] and this family contains inﬁnitely many distinct manifolds [BGS, Thm. 1.13] .
Furthermore, for k > q > 0,Wkcan be deformed to Wq[BGS, Thm. 1.28] .
For each Poisson manifold ( Wk, σ), we want to study moduli spaces of vector bundles over
(Wk, ⋆) where ⋆is the corresponding star product.
[K, Prop. 3.1] showed that a rank 2 bundle EonWkwith ﬁrst Chern class c1(E) = 0 is deter-
mined by a canonical transition matrix/parenleftbiggzjp

We wish to describe the structure of moduli spaces of vector b undles on Wk. Using the results
of this section, we may proceed analogously to the classical (commutative) setup, to extract
moduli spaces out of extension groups of line bundles, by con sidering extension classes up to
bundle isomorphism.
4.Moduli of bundles on noncommutative deformations
We recall the notion of isomorphism of vector bundles on a non commutative deformation of Wk.
Deﬁnition 4.1. LetEandE′be vector bundles over ( Wk, σ) deﬁned by transition matrices T
andT′respectively. An isomorphism between EandE′is given by a pair of matrices AUand
AVwith entries in Aσ(U) and Aσ(V), respectively, which are invertible with respect to ⋆and
such that
T′=AV⋆ T ⋆ A U.
Notation 4.2. Denoting by Ext1
Alg(A(j),A(−j)) the subset of formally algebraic extension
classes, we denote by Mj(Wk) the quotient
Mj(Wk):= Ext1
Alg(A(j),A(−j))/∼
consisting of those classes of formally algebraic vector bu ndles (Def. 3.1), whose classical limit is a
stable vector bundle of charge j. Here ∼denotes bundle isomorphism as in Def. 4.1and following
[BGK2 ] stability means that the classical limit does not split on t he 0-th formal neighbourhood.
We denote by M/planckover2pi1n
j(Wk, σ) the moduli of bundles obtained by imposing the cut-oﬀ /planckover2pi1n+1= 0,
that is, the superscript /planckover2pi1nmeans quantised to level n.
Note that Mj(Wk, σ):=M/planckover2pi10
j(Wk, σ) =Mj(Wk) recovers the classical moduli space obtained
when/planckover2pi1= 0, while M/planckover2pi1
j(Wk, σ) denotes the moduli on the ﬁrst order quantization, which wi ll be
the focus of this work. Accordingly:
Deﬁnition 4.3. We call Mj(Wk, σ) the classical moduli space andM/planckover2pi1
j(Wk, σ) the quantum
moduli space of bundles on Wk.
Lemma 4.4. [BGS, Thm. 2.7] The classical moduli spaces of vector bundles of rank 2 and
splitting type jonWkhas dimension 4j−5.
Deﬁnition 4.5. The splitting type of a vector bundle Eon (Wk, σ) is the one of its classical
limit [ BG, Def. 5.2]. Hence, when the classical limit is an SL(2 ,C) bundle, the splitting type of
Eis the smallest integer jsuch that Ecan be written as an extension of A(j) by A(−j).
We ﬁx a splitting type jand look at rank 2 bundles on the ﬁrst formal neighbourhood ℓ(1)of
ℓ≃P1⊂W1together with their extensions up to ﬁrst order in /planckover2pi1. We now calculate isomorphism
classes. Let p+p′/planckover2pi1andq+q′/planckover2pi1be two extension classes in Ext1
A(A(j),A(−j)) which are of
splitting type j,i.e.in canonical U-coordinates p, p′, q, q′are multiples of u1, u2.
According to Def. 4.1bundles deﬁned by p+p′/planckover2pi1andq+q′/planckover2pi1are isomorphic, if there exist

We wish to determine the constraints such an isomorphism imp oses on the coeﬃcients of qand
q′. This is more conveniently rewritten by multiplying by the r ight-inverse of/parenleftig
zjq+q′/planckover2pi1
0z−j/parenrightig
, which
(modulo /planckover2pi12) is
/parenleftbiggz−j−q−q′/planckover2pi1+ 2z−j{zj, q}/planckover2pi1
0 zj/parenrightbigg
.
We have that the zero section ℓ≃P1is cut out inside Wkbyu1=u2= 0. Hence, the n-th
formal neighbourhood of ℓis by deﬁnition ℓ(n)=OW1
In+1where I=< u 1, u2>. So, on ℓ(1)we
have that u2
1=u2
2=u1u2= 0 and therefore we may write
a=a0+a1
1u1+a2
1u2, α =α0+α1
1u1+α2
1u2,
etc., where ai
1,αi
1, etc. are holomorphic functions of z.
Following the details of the proof of [ G, Prop. 3.3] we assume in ( 4.6) that a0=α0,d0=δ0are
constant and b=β= 0. Since we already know that on the classical limit the only equivalence
onℓ(1)is projectivization [ G, Prop. 3.2], we assume p=q, keeping in mind a projectivization to
be done in the end. We may also assume that the determinants of the changes of coordinates
on the classical limit are 1. Accordingly, we rewrite ( 4.6) as:
/parenleftbiggα+α′/planckover2pi1 β′/planckover2pi1
γ+γ′/planckover2pi1δ+δ′/planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg

0 zj/parenrightbigg
(4.7)
where a0=d0=α0=δ0= 1.
Since we already know the moduli in the classical limit, we on ly need to study terms containing
/planckover2pi1, which after multiplying are:
(1,1) = a′+{zja, z−j}+{zj, a}z−j+{pc, z−j}+{p, c}z−j+ (pc′+p′c)z−j
(1,2) = {p, d}zj− {a, p}zj− {zj, a}p+{zj, p}a+{pd, zj}+ 2z−j{zj, p}pc+z2jb′
−(pa′+q′a)zj+ (pd′+p′d)zj−(pc′+p′c+q′c)p
(2,1) = z−2jc′
(2,2) = d′+{z−jd, zj}+{z−j, d}zj− {z−jc, p} − { z−j, c}p−(pc′+q′c)z−j+ 2{zj, p}z−2jc.
All four terms must be adjusted using the free variables to on ly contain expressions which are
holomorphic on Vto satisfy ( 4.7). For example, in the (2 ,1) term this condition is satisﬁed
precisely when c′is a section of O(2j). Computing Poisson brackets, we see that the (1 ,1) and
(2,2) terms can always be made holomorphic on Vby appropriate choices of candd′, leaving
the coeﬃcients of a′free. We will need to use these free coeﬃcients for the next st ep.
It remains to analyse the (1 ,2) term. Because we are working on the ﬁrst formal neighbourh ood
ofℓ, terms in u2
1, u1u2, u2
2or higher vanish (recall that we assume that p, p′, q′are multiples of u1
oru2). Since z2jb′is there to cancel out any possible terms having power of zgreater or equal
to 2j, we remove it from the expression, keeping in mind that we onl y need to cancel out the
coeﬃcients of the monomials ziu1andziu2with i≤2j−1 in the expression:
(1,2) = {p, d+a}zj−{zj, a}p+{zj, p}a+{pd, zj}+2z−j{zj, p}pc+p(d′−a′)zj+(p′−q′)zj.(/enc-87)
To determine the quantum moduli spaces, we must verify what r estrictions are imposed on q′so
that p′andq′deﬁne isomorphic bundles. Since this requires computing br ackets, the analysis
must be carried out separately for each noncommutative defo rmation.QUANTIZATION OF CALABI–YAU THREEFOLDS 8
5.Quantum moduli of bundles on W1
The Calabi–Yau threefold we consider in this section is the c repant resolution of the conifold
singularity xy−zw= 0, that is,
W1:= Tot( OP1(−1)⊕ OP1(−1)).
We will carry out calculations using the canonical coordina tesW1=U∪Vwhere U≃C3≃V
with U={z, u1, u2},V={ξ, v1, v2}, and change of coordinates on U∩V≃C∗×C×Cgiven
by/braceleftbigξ=z−1,v1=zu1,v2=zu2/bracerightbig.
Consequently, global functions on W1are generated over Cby the monomials 1 , u1, zu1, u2, zu2.
For each speciﬁc noncommutative deformation ( W1,Aσ), we wish to compare the quantum and
classical moduli spaces of vector bundles, see Def. 4.3. This is part of the general quest to
understand how deformations of a variety aﬀect moduli of bun dles on it, and it is worth noting
that no commutative deformation of W1is known to exits.
For a rank 2 bundle Eon a noncommutative deformation W1with a canonical matrix/parenleftig

as in ( 3.10) where p=/summationtext∞
n=0pn/planckover2pi1n, expression ( 3.8) gives us the general form of the coeﬃcients
pn. In particular, on the ﬁrst formal neighbourhood, we have:
p=j−1/summationdisplay
l=−j+2pl10zlu1+j−1/summationdisplay
l=−j+2pl01zlu2, (5.1)
where p= 0 if j= 1.
Each noncommutative deformation comes from some Poisson st ructure which determines the ﬁrst
order terms of the corresponding star product, see Sec. 2. The most basic Poisson structures σ
onW1are those which generate all others over global functions. W e call these generators the
basic Poisson structures.
Theorem 5.2. Ifσis a basic Poisson structure on W1, then the quantum moduli space M/planckover2pi1
j(Wk, σ)
and its classical limit are isomorphic:
M/planckover2pi1
j(W1, σ)≃Mj(W1)≃P4j−5.
Proof. We perform the computations using the bracket σ1=∂z∧∂u1; the choice of such a
generator is irrelevant, since all the 4 generators give pai rwise isomorphic Poisson manifolds. To
obtain an isomorphism, we need to cancel out all coeﬃcients o f the terms

Now we need to cancel out separately the coeﬃcients of each mo nomial ziu1andziu2for 2 ≤
i≤2j−1, that is, all those terms potentially giving nonholomorph ic functions. To determineQUANTIZATION OF CALABI–YAU THREEFOLDS 9
the classes in the moduli space we need to verify what constra ints are imposed on q′. Take for
instance the monomial ziu1in (p′d−q′a)zj. Since a′remains free we can always choose its
corresponding coeﬃcient in order to cancel out the term in ziu1in the entire expression of (1 ,2).
Indeed, notice that the expressions p(d′−a′)zjand ( p′d−q′a)zjcontain monomials of the same
orders, all of which may be adjusted to zero by choosing a′. Moreover the ﬁrst three summands
in/enc-87also contain the same list of monomials, hence may also be abs orbed by the appropriate
choices of coeﬃcients of a, a′andc.
Since this process can be independently carried out for each monomial, we then conclude that
the expression /enc-87can be made holomorphic on Vfor any choice of q′. Hence, there are no
restrictions on q′. Thus, we obtain an equivalence p+p′/planckover2pi1∼p+q′/planckover2pi1for all q′and the projection
onto the classical limit (the ﬁrst coordinate)
π1:M/planckover2pi1
j(W1, σ)→Mj(W1)
taking ( p, p′) to pis an isomorphism. The isomorphism type of the moduli space i s given in
[BGS, Lem. 6.2] as P4j−5. /square
We now calculate the quantum moduli space for the particular choice of splitting type j= 2 and
for a diﬀerent choice of Poisson structure on W1. We use the notation p∈Mj(W1) to refer to
a point in the classical moduli space, that is, a rank 2 bundle is labelled by its extension class.
Example 5.3 (j= 2 and σ=u1σ1).Here we write
p=p0zu1+p1u1+p2zu2+p3u2, p′=p′
0zu1+p′
1u1+p′
2zu2+p′

for the ﬁrst order part of the extension class, where we have r enamed the coeﬃcients to simplify
notation ( p0:=p110, p1:=p010, p2:=p101, p3:=p001). Lem. 2.1implies that σ=u1σ1is also
a Poisson structure on W1. With this choice, all brackets acquire an extra u1in comparison
to the bracket σ1used in the proof of Thm. 5.2, so that in the ﬁrst formal neighbourhood the
(1,2)-term described in /enc-87simpliﬁes to just:
/enc-87=z2p(d′−a′) +z2(p′−q′).
Here a′=a′

d′−a′= (d′−a′)0+ (d′−a′)1u1+ (d′−a′)2u2.
Hence, the total expression of /enc-87is
/enc-87= (p0z3u1+p1z2u1+p2z3u2+p3z2u2)((d′−a′)0+ (d′−a′)1u1+ (d′−a′)2u2))

and since all terms in (1 ,2) having powers of zequal to 4 and higher can be cancelled out by
the appropriate choice of the z2jb′, it suﬃces to analyse the expression

When the vectors v1= (p0, p1, p2, p3) and v2= (0, p1,0, p3) are linearly independent, the point
q′belongs to the plane that passes through the point p′with v1andv2as direction vectors.
Therefore, whenever v1andv2are linearly independent vectors, the ﬁbre over p= (p0, p1, p2, p3)
is a copy of C4foliated by 2-planes. The leaf containing a point p′forms the equivalence class
ofp′. Thus, the moduli space over the ﬁbre over pis parametrised by the 2-plane through the
origin in the direction perpendicular to v1, v2over the point p, except when p1=p3= 0.
In contrast, the ﬁbre over a point p= (p0,0, p2,0) is a copy of C4foliated by lines in the
direction of v1= (p0,0, p2,0). In this case, the moduli space over pis parametrised by a copy of
C3perpendicular to v1.
We conclude that M/planckover2pi1
2(W1, σ)→M2(W1)≃P3(where the isomorphism is given by Lem. 4.4) is
the ´ etale space of a constructible sheaf, whose stalks have
•dimension 2 over the Zariski open set ( p1, p3)/ne}ationslash= (0,0), and
•dimension 3 over the P1cut out by p1=p3= 0 inP3.
The same techniques readily generalise to give a descriptio n of the quantum moduli spaces for
other choices of noncommutative deformations.
Theorem 5.4. Ifσis an extremal Poisson structure on W1, then the quantum moduli space
M/planckover2pi1
j(W1, σ)can be viewed as the ´ etale space of a constructible sheaf of g eneric rank 2j−2over
the classical moduli space Mj(W1)with singular stalks up to rank 4j−5.
Proof. We give the details of the case j= 3, for an extremal Poisson structure, that is, the case
when all brackets vanish on the ﬁrst formal neighbourhood. T he general case is clear from these
calculations, just notationally more complicated.
When j= 3 and σ=u1σ1, expression /enc-87becomes:
/enc-87=p(d′−a′)z3+ (p′d−q′a)z3,

6.Quantum moduli of bundles on W2
The Calabi–Yau threefold we consider in this section is a cre pant resolution of the singularity
xy−w2= 0 inC4, that is
W2:= Tot( OP1(−2)⊕ OP1) =Z2×C.
Similarly to what we did for W1, we will carry out calculations using the canonical coordin ates
W2=U∪Vwhere U≃C3≃Vwith U={z, u1, u2},V={ξ, v1, v2}, and change of coordinates
onU∩V≃C∗×C×Cgiven by
/braceleftbigξ=z−1,v1=z2u1,v2=u2/bracerightbig.
Consequently, global holomorphic functions on W2are generated by 1 , u1, zu1, z2u1, u2.
For each speciﬁc noncommutative deformation ( W2,Aσ), we wish to compare the quantum and
classical moduli spaces of vector bundles, see Def. 4.3.
For a rank 2 bundle Eon a noncommutative deformation W2with a canonical matrix/parenleftig

as in ( 3.10) where p=/summationtext∞
n=0pn/planckover2pi1n, expression ( 3.8) gives us the general form of the coeﬃcients
pn. In particular, on the ﬁrst formal neighbourhood, we have:
p=j−1/summationdisplay
l=−j+3pl10zlu1+j−1/summationdisplay
l=−j+1pl01zlu2 (6.1)
where in case j= 1 we have only p001u2.
To describe the quantum moduli for Poisson structures on W2, we consider the expression /enc-87:
/enc-87={p, d+a}zj− {zj, a}p+{zj, p}a+{pd, zj}+ 2z−j{zj, p}pc+p(d′−a′)zj+ (p′d−q′a)zj,
where we need to cancel out the coeﬃcients of z3u1, . . . , z2j−1u1and zu2, . . . , z2j−1u2.QUANTIZATION OF CALABI–YAU THREEFOLDS 12
Each noncommutative deformation comes from some Poisson st ructure. The most basic Poisson
structures σonW2are those which generate all others over global functions. W e call these
generators the basic Poisson structures. Now, we compute the quantum moduli of bu ndles for
them.
Remark. We observe that the 4 Poisson manifolds (W2, σi)fori= 1,2,3,4,are pairwise
nonisomorphic. This can be veriﬁed by the table of their dege neracy loci:
W2Poisson structures
bracket degeneracy
σ1
σ2 ∅
σ3
σ4 ∪
Nevertheless, the 4 quantum moduli spaces deﬁned by these ba sic Poisson structures turn out to
be all isomorphic.
Theorem 6.2. Ifσis a basic Poisson structure on W2, then the quantum moduli space M/planckover2pi1
j(Wk, σ)
and its classical limit are isomorphic:
M/planckover2pi1
j(W2, σ)≃Mj(W2)≃P4j−5.
Proof. We carry out calculations for the basic bracket σ4=u1∂u1∧∂u2.It does turn out that
the result is the same for the the basic brackets. The calcula tion for σ4is shorter, since any
of the brackets having one entry equal to zjvanishes. Because we work on the ﬁrst formal
neighbourhood, we also remove the expressions that are quad ratic in the uivariables.
So, the expression /enc-87that remains to be analysed simpliﬁes to:
/enc-87={p, d+a}zj+p(d′−a′)zj+ (p′d−q′a)zj,
where we must cancel out the coeﬃcients of the monomials z3u1, . . . , z2j−1u1andzu2, . . . , z2j−1u2.
On the ﬁrst formal neighbourhood, we write
a= 1 + a1(z)u1+a2(z)u2, d = 1 + d1(z)u1+d2(z)u2,and
a′=a′
0(z) +a′
1(z)u1+a′
2(z)u2, d′=d′
0(z) +d′
1(z)u1+d′
2(z)u2,
so that the partials are
∂uia=ai(z)∂uid=di(z) and ∂u2a=a2(z)∂u2d=d2(z).
The extension class given in ( 3.9) becomes p=j−1/summationdisplay
l=3−jpl10zlu1+j−1/summationdisplay
l=1−jpl01zlu2,and computing
the bracket gives

j−1/summationdisplay
l=1−jpl01zl
(d1(z) +a1(z))zju1.
To work with a simpler notation, we present details of /enc-87when j= 2, in which case we can
express the extension class as
p=p0zu1+p1zu2+p2u2+p3z−1u2,QUANTIZATION OF CALABI–YAU THREEFOLDS 13
having renamed the coeﬃcients for simplicity (making p0:=p110, p1:=p101, p2:=p001, p3:=
p−101). We will point out the steps for generalising to higher j.
Assuming j= 2, we have
{p, d+a}z2=p0(d2(z) +a2(z))z3u1+ (p1z3+p2z2+p3z)(d1(z) +a1(z))u1.
To obtain equivalence between q′andp′, we must cancel out coeﬃcients of z3u1, zu2, z2u2, z3u2
in the expression of /enc-87, which becomes
/enc-87=p0(d2(z) +a2(z))z3u1+ (p1z3+p2z2+p3z)(d1(z) +a1(z))u1

−(q′

1z3u2+q′
2z2u2+q′
3zu2).
Since the highest power of zto be considered is 3, we observe that d2(z) +a2(z) may be chosen
conveniently, we cancel out all terms in z3u1. We may also choose d1(z) +a1(z) = 0, leaving
/enc-87= (p1z3u2+p2z2u2+p3zu2)(d′

Now we may choose d′
0−a′
0appropriately to cancel out all terms in u2. We conclude that there
are no conditions imposed on q′. In other words, here p+p′/planckover2pi1is equivalent to p+q′/planckover2pi1for any
choice of q′. Hence, the quantum and classical moduli spaces are isomorp hic.
The generalisation to higher jworks out similarly, we can ﬁrst choose di+aifori >0 to cancel
out the coeﬃcients of u1and then choose d′
0−a′
0to take care of the coeﬃcients of u2. So, for all
jusing the bracket σ4we conclude that the quantum and classical moduli spaces are isomorphic
M/planckover2pi1
j(W2, σ4)≃Mj(W2)≃P4j−5
where the second isomorphism is proven in [ K, Prop. 3.24]. /square
Example 6.3. Now choose any Poisson structure of W2for which all brackets in /enc-87vanish on
neighbourhood 1, for example σ=u1σ4=u2
1∂u1∧∂u2works. In such a case, the expression for
/enc-87reduces to:
/enc-87=p(d′−a′)zj+ (p′d−q′a)zj.

which is the parametric equation of a line in the ( q′

Ifp0=p3= 0, then we must have the equality ( q′

consists of a single point.
Accordingly, the set of equivalence classes over pcan be represented either by the line L⊥by

the ´ etale space of a constructible sheaf, whose stalks have
•dimension 1 over the Zariski open set ( p0, p3)/ne}ationslash= (0,0), and
•dimension 2 over the P1cut out by p0=p3= 0 inP3.
In fact, we could express this moduli space as a sheaf given by an extension of OP3(+1) by a
torsion sheaf.
Theorem 6.4. Ifσis an extremal Poisson structure on W2, then the quantum moduli space

j(W2, σ)can be viewed as the ´ etale space of a constructible sheaf of g eneric rank 2j−3over

Proof. Now, for j= 3, we write down the extremal example when the brackets vani sh on the

this example. Where, assuming all brackets vanish on the ﬁrs t formal neighbourhood, we need

2(W2, σ)p= corank Up= 6−rkUp≤6.
In the general case we then have
2j−3≤dimM/planckover2pi1
j(W2, σ)p= corank Up= 2j−rkUp≤4j−6.

Appendix A.Computations of H1
Lemma A.1. H1(W1,O) =H1(W2,O) = 0 .
Proof. A 1-cocycle τ∈ O(U∩V) may be written in the form
τU=∞/summationdisplay
l=−∞∞/summationdisplay
i=0∞/summationdisplay
s=0τliszlui
1us
2.
Since terms containing only positive powers of zare holomorphic on the U-chart
τU∼−1/summationdisplay
l=−∞∞/summationdisplay
i=0∞/summationdisplay
s=0τliszlui

2,
where ∼denotes cohomological equivalence. Changing to Vcoordinates we have
τV=−1/summationdisplay
l=−∞∞/summationdisplay
i=0∞/summationdisplay
s=0τlisξ−l+ki+(−k+2)svi

2, (A.2)
where, for k= 1,2 exponents of ξare non-negative. Thus, τVis holomorphic on V, and
τ∼0. /square
Lemma A.3. H1(W3,O)is inﬁnite dimensional over C.QUANTIZATION OF CALABI–YAU THREEFOLDS 16
Proof. As in the proof of Lem. A.1we arrive at the expression ( A.2) for the 1-cocycle τon the
V-chart, which in the case k= 3, gives
τV∼−1/summationdisplay
l=−∞∞/summationdisplay
i=0∞/summationdisplay
s=0τlisξ−l+3i−svi

2.
The terms that are not holomorphic on Vare all of those satisfying −l+ 3i−s <0.
We conclude that all terms having s >3i−l, namely all of
−1/summationdisplay
l=−∞∞/summationdisplay
i=0∞/summationdisplay

are nontrivial in ﬁrst cohomology, so that dim H1(W3,O) =∞. /square
