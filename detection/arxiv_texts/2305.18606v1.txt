Taming the instabilities inherent to many nonlinear optica l phenomena is of paramount
importance for modern photonics. In particular, the so-cal led snake instability is uni-
versally known to severely distort localized wave stripes, leading to the occurrence of
transient, short-lived dynamical states that eventually d ecay. The phenomenon is ubiq-
uitous in nonlinear science, from river meandering to super ﬂuids, and to date it remains
apparently uncontrollable. However, here we show that opti cal snake instabilities can
be harnessed by a process that leads to the formation of stati onary and robust two-
dimensional zigzag states. We ﬁnd that such new type of nonli near waves exists in the
hyperbolic regime of cylindrical micro-resonators and it n aturally corresponds to two-
dimensional frequency combs featuring spectral heterogen eity and intrinsic synchro-
nization. We uncover the conditions of the existence of such spatiotemporal photonic
snakes and conﬁrm their remarkable robustness against pert urbations. Our ﬁndings
represent a new paradigm for frequency comb generation, thu s opening the door to a
whole range of applications in communications, metrology, and spectroscopy.
Since their discovery almost half a century ago, the so-
called ﬂexural instabilities [1], which lead to the unar-
restable decay of quasi-one-dimensional self-sustained
states such as solitons [2, 3], have been encountered in
all areas of nonlinear sciences. Namely, they have been
found to occur in the dynamics of river meandering [4],
classical ﬂuids [5], fermion [6, 7] and polariton [8] su-
perﬂuids, Bose-Einstein condensates [9], chemistry [10],
and, importantly, nonlinear photonics [11–15]. The ini-
tial stages of the instability −referred to as the snakein-
stability [2] −evinces the reshaping of straight states into
zigzags caused by spontaneous and local transversedrifts
with alternating directions, which occur prior to the ir-
reversible decay of the corresponding states. In contrast
to the use of the instability in several systems, e.g., to
trigger spontaneous vortex formation [9, 11, 12], its con-
trolled arrest to form robust multi-dimensional snaking
states remains hitherto unexpected.
In parallel, in recent years, microring cavities have
emerged as an outstanding platform for exploring the
fundamental properties and the applications of stabilised
one-dimensional dissipative nonlinear waves, in both the
normal and the anomalous dispersion regimes, under a
plethora of potentially unfavourable situations, such as
strong dispersive [16, 17], inelastic [18–20], and thermal
[21, 22]eﬀects. Eachand everynewsolitonicstatesfound
in such micron-sized systems correspond to highly sta-
ble frequency combs that contribute to the developing
ﬁeld of comb-related applications [23, 24]. As a conse-
∗carmien@upvnet.upv.esquence, microring-like cavities are highly appealing sys-
tems to push the frontiers of knowledge of nonlinear
phenomena as well as boosting applications in photon-
ics. Nowadays, most solitonic states (stable combs) that
have been experimentally observed in microrings occur
in essentially single-comb forming devices, except for the
few exceptions that maybe found in counter-propagating
soliton experiments [25, 26], in systems with two micror-
ings [27, 28], or in cavities with a few transverse modes
[29], whereeachofthe individual combsareformallyone-
dimensional. The potential of two-dimensionalfrequency
combs, which to date is essentially unexplored experi-
mentally, remains to be uncovered.
Here we discover the existence of robust spatiotempo-
ral photonic snakes in cylindrical micro-resonators with
normal group velocity dispersion (GVD) and in the pres-
ence of diﬀraction along the cylinder’s axis. Such previ-
ously unknown states are a continuous two-dimensional
ensemble of heterogeneous combs which are inherently
synchronised by the nonlinearity. Thus, they represent a
whole new paradigm for frequency comb formation.

tions into realistic optical frequency comb forming exper-

cylindrical micro-cavities [cf. Fig. 6], including Raman
and thermal nonlinearities, among others (see methods).

develop nonlinear resonances, associated to the single

an unusually rich multi-stability landscape, as shown in

z), the background states become single and multi-stripe
solitons [cf. insets ( ii)-(viii)] distributed on top of the
smooth background [cf. inset ( i)], recalling the spatial
solitons reported in pioneering works [35]. The presence
of stripes impinges an intricate morphology of the res-
onances strongly deviating from that of the tri-valued
(bistable) one-dimensional counterparts (marked for ref-
erence by the light-grey curves in Figs. 1b-g). Reso-
nances associated to wider or more intense pumps (i.e.,
greaterσzandh0, respectively) contain states hosting
more stripes and reshape to exhibit splitting (Figs. 1c,e),
nesting (Figs. 1d,f,g), and closed loops (Fig. 1f). As dis-
cussed below, the properties of resonances are intimately
linked to the existence of snake states.
Photonic snakes. The soliton stripes described above
are prone to snake instabilities. When these develop,
stripes distort and acquire in our dissipative system aperiodic zigzag snaking proﬁle, becoming inhomogeneous
alongxand, hence, polychromatic. The central result of
this work is that the transverse drifts induced by the
snake instability are fully arrested after they exerted
certain distortion to stripes so that perfectly stationary
snakes form [see Figs. 2(i)-(ix) for typical proﬁles]. Fig-
ures2a, b present the branches [max( |ψ(x,z)|) vs de-
tuning] corresponding to the complete set of snakes ex-
isting with narrow pump, σz= 4, for diﬀerent driving

periods in the microcavity circumference exist and those
with 2 to 4 periods are stable for some detuning inter-
vals. We denote diﬀerent branches of snakes featuring N

space, as shown in Figs. 2a-d. To further illustrate this,
Fig.2e shows the existence domain on the {δ,σz}plane
for theS2family, which is found to be stable within the
black area, unstable within the light shaded area, and
non-existent otherwise (white area). In this work, opti-
mal conditions for the snakes stability are encountered
only for strong pump localisation along z. Outside the
stability domain, snakes are exposed to oscillatory and
exponential instabilities leading, respectively, to breath-
ing and decay. The precise combination of the driving
amplitude and aspect ratio of the pump ﬁeld, σz/L, (ly-
ing in the range [1
8,1

mation of robust snakes.
Photonicsnakefamiliesemergesupercriticallyfromthe
top branch of the cavity resonance, each with a diﬀerent
detuning threshold (marked with black dots in Fig. 2),
corresponding to the detuning values at which stripes
become unstable due to the growth of snake type per-
turbations or internal modes [36] (see methods for the
stability analysis description). Figure 3shows all rele-
vant growth rates for the three branches (top, middle,
and bottom) of the right-most cavity resonance shown
in Fig.1e. Snake-type perturbations ( χS, see top insets
in Fig.3) with diﬀerent periods acquire positive growth
rates on the top and middle branches of the resonance.

erties of the stripes internal modes allows one to readily
predict the symmetries to be inherited by the emerging
snake family.
Althoughourattentionisfocusedonthesnakeinstabil-
ity, we point out that the middle branch of the resonance
in Fig.3also presents neckinstabilities [1], which often
compete with the snake type [37]and manifests upon the
growth of the corresponding internal modes, denoted by
χD1-χD3and shown in the right inset of Fig. 3. In this
work, all of the spatiotemporal states found with traces
of neck perturbations, namely, the dark solitons in Figs.
2(x-xii) and the hybrid snake-dark solitons in Fig. 4j,l,
were highly unstable and thus their properties are not
discussed in details.
The photonic snake families become much richer when
snake instabilities develop on the multi-stripe states
present on cavity resonances with large pump beam
widths,σz/greaterorsimilar8 (cf. Fig. 1), what leads to the formation
of coupled multi-snake states. Figure 4a shows an exam-

and merges with 4-stripe state at a higher δ(red dots).
Even though we only found stable in-phase multi-
snakes, the system supports a vast collection of states
with diﬀerent morphology. Some of these are illustrated
in Fig.4h and Figs. 4j,k,l which appear after the anti-
phasesnake modes in Figs. 4g and4i grow, respectively,
on two- and three-stripe states. This results in the for-
mation of anti-phase snakes that appear alone (Fig. 4h),
mixed with dark solitons (Fig. 4j), together with ellip-
soids (Fig. 4k), or displaying asymmetries along z(Fig.
4l).
Heterogeneous 2D combs. The most remarkable fea-ture of photonic snake states is that their spectrum is
heterogeneous along z, while being inherently synchro-
nized by the nonlinearity. Figure 5shows a soliton stripe
(Fig.5a) and snakes of diﬀerent tilts and periods (Figs.
5b-d), together with their frequency comb distribution
alongz(Figs.5e-h). Heterogeneity is evident in Figs.
5g,h, showing Fourier spectra along the z-axis, and it is
further illustrated in insets I−IVby showing diﬀerent
combs extracted at diﬀerent axial positions (marked by
horizontal white lines in Figs. 5c,g). Synchronisation
and heterogeneity of these spectra is readily important
for metrology and spectroscopy [38]. The spreading of
the combs along the cylinder’s axis, z, naturally intro-
ducesthe notionofheterogeneoustwo-dimensionalcomb,
which constitutes a generalisation of the widely reported
one-dimensional comb and a central result of this work.

Robustness. The photonic snakes and the two-
dimensional combs exist in a physical setting that is
readily realizable. In particular, consider a hollow micro-
cylinder made of silica glass, with a radius R= 100µm
and wall thickness w= 0.75µm, pumped at λp≈
1.26µm, with a Q-factor of ∼5×106, and take into
account the expected speciﬁc eﬀects introduced by chro-
matic dispersion, Raman and thermal nonlinearities, and
the localised coupling, in xandz, between the pump
beam and the micro-cavity (see the full model in meth-
ods). Although each of the above perturbations may
be suppressed in various ways, we now show that ro-
bust snakes occur in passive driven cylindrical micro-
resonators. Figure 6presents an overview of our pre-
dictions in such scenarios, focusing the attention on the
snake family S2withh0= 1.4 andσz= 4. Figure 6a
showsthe thermal shift ofthe nonlinearresonance[black]
with respect to the unperturbed cold resonance [grey], as
well as the S2snake branch, which stable region is high-
lighted by the thick trace. An example of robust snake
is shown in Fig. 6b, along with its associated Raman vi-
bration (Fig. 6c) and thermal (Fig. 6d) ﬁelds. The cor-
responding two-dimensional comb is shown around the
central lines in Fig. 6e. We emphasize that in the context
of one-dimensional combs, solitons and related nonlin-ear waves have been reported under the thermal non-
linearity [41], both experimentally [21] and theoretically
[42]. In one dimension, thermal eﬀects mainly induce
a global shift in the laser-cavity detuning which, even
if they introduce their own instabilities [41, 42], cannot
compromise soliton existence itself. However, in the two-
dimensional case here considered, thermal eﬀects are in-
homogenous along z(cf. Fig.6d), and hence induce ther-
mal stress alongz. As a consequence, the mere existence
of the two-dimensional snakes cannot be anticipated a
priori, and neither can their stability. The latter is for-
mallypredicted via linearstability analysisand explicitly
checked by long propagation runs (cf. Fig. 6f) spanning
over50,000cavityroundtrips(equivalent to155nsin our
geometry). Propagationofrobustsnakesunderthewhole
plethora of realistic eﬀects feature constant peak ampli-
tudes (as a consequence of the steady two-dimensional
proﬁles) despite the input random noise and step-to-step
perturbations. On the contrary, unstable snakes behave
verydiﬀerently. In particular, Fig. 6g shows the time evo-
lution of an oscillatory unstable snake, featuring peak
amplitude and proﬁle variations (see insets). The pres-
ence and absence of instabilities, and the nature of them
in the former case, are accurately predicted by the sta-
bility analysis (see methods), which results are displayed
in insets of Figs. 6f,g.

of frequency combs in the normal GVD regime of pas-
sively driven cavities, naturally provided here by the in-
trinsically two-dimensional snakes, has remained hidden
till date by the low dimensionality of microrings, where
relatively complex excitation methods were typically re-
quired. Indeed, in one-dimensional microrings, solitonic
combs in the normal GVD regime are often excited by
engineering a small anomalous GVD region around thepump’s frequency, so modulational instability triggers
comb formation. This is achieved via mode coupling
eﬀects arising due to avoided crossings in multi-modal
microrings [43–46] or with the aid of an auxiliary ring
[47, 48]. A recent workdemonstrates a much simpler and
straight-forward mechanism to excite (one-dimensional)
dark solitons via self-injection-locking [49] and display-
ing the turnkey [50] operation. Photonic snake states
may thus belong to the collection of simple and deter-
ministically excitable combs in cavities with dominant
normal GVD, which is of central importance for extend-
ing the formation of micro-cavity combs to the long and
shortwavelengthregions,farawayfromthetelecomband
around 1.5µm.
In addition, the two-dimensional combs reported here
automatically enable the possibility to host synchronised
heterogeneous combs in a single device, features that
are of great importance in metrology and spectroscopy,
and may be diﬃcult to combine in this speciﬁc man-
ner with microrings. Indeed, comb heterogeneity may
be achieved in the one-dimensional context, e.g., via the
excitationofunbounded solitonscopropagatingalongthe
same spatial channel [51]. However, their diﬀerent group
velocities unavoidably yield de-synchronisation. On the
other hand, synchronisation was previously reported for
identical combs in distant microrings [52]. Remarkably,
both features were found simultaneously in the bi-modal
stokessolitons[19], whereheterogeneityappearedasare-
sult of two copropagatingand spectrally non-overlapping
combs. In the present work, diﬀerently with the above,
and akin to the two-dimensional geometry, the hetero-
geneity appears as a continuous comb reshaping along
the cylinder’s axis and with a ﬁxed carrier frequency.
We note that the above remarkable ﬁndings [19, 51, 52]
were reported in the anomalous GVD region, where the
physics is substantially diﬀerent than that in the normal
GVD regime, subject of this work.
In summary, we have uncovered a fundamentally new
mechanism to arrest and control the ubiquitous and oth-
erwise strong snake instability in cylindrical Kerr micro-
resonators and, as a result, the possibility to form com-
plex robust spatiotemporal snake states. Speciﬁcally,
we have found that photonic snakes naturally form per-
fectly synchronised heterogeneous comb ensembles in the
normal GVD (hyperbolic) regime of cylindrical micro-
cavities. The phenomenon represents a novel paradigm
for the generation of optical frequency combs.

whereψ, ∆T,Qare the optical, thermal, and molec-
ular vibrational ﬁelds, respectively. The above model
assumes that only one radial mode family of the cylin-
der is at play, which may be unambiguously achieved by
considering a hollow cylinder with an thin wall width,
e.g.,w= 0.75µm, as we used in Fig. 6. The cylinder’s
dispersion is given by
ˆD≡+∞/summationdisplay

kx0,kz0,(9)
whereγis the normalised cavity loss, Ris the cylinder’s
radius,τtheroundtriptime, and kx,kzthe wavenumbers
associated to the the X,zcoordinates ( Xis the frame at
restinthelab). Thedispersiontermswithlow p,qindices
account for: p= 0,q= 0, resonance frequency ( ω0);p=
1,q= 1, group velocity of the pump’s frequency along X
(b1,1);p= 2,q= 2, GVD; p= 2,q= 0, diﬀraction. The
rest of terms are all included in the higher order disper-
sionoperator ˆDhod≡ˆD−ω0τ/γ+ib1,1∂X−1
2(∂2
X−∂2
z).
The even parity of the cylinder’s dispersion around z
(see, e.g., [1, 2]) and the fact that we expand around the
kz0= 0 yields the nullity of all coeﬃcients with p−q= 1.
The relation between normalised and physical coordi-
nates is as follows: X=Xphys/(2πR)/radicalbig
γ/(2|B2,0|),
z=Zphys/(2πR)/radicalbig
γ/(2|B0,2|).
In our simulations, the width of the numerical win-
dow alongxwasL= 16, which together with the choice
ofγ= 0.001 setsB2,0≈ −2×10−6, attainable with a
silica glass cylinder of R= 100µm and wall-width w=
0.75µmatλp≈1.26µm, whichfeaturesaroundtriptimeτ= 3.1 ps and a quality factor Q=ωpτ/γ≈4.9×106
(ωp= 2πc/λp), reasonable for cylinders [3]. The main
higher dispersion terms are given by B3,0≈9.26×10−10,
B4,0≈ −2.83×10−13,B0,2≈1.21×10−4. The nor-
malised detuning is δ= (ωp−ω0)τ/γ.
The pump beam, assumed of Gaussian proﬁle, has an
amplitudeh0and a width σz. Under realistic conditions
(cf. Fig.6), the pump beam is also localised along X, and
this is accounted for via the function ξ(X), whereNis
the normalisation factor such that max( ξ(X)) = 1.
Thermal eﬀects are introduced via the light-to-phonon
energy conversion, A= 10−2, and the corresponding
cooling rate, B= 5×10−2, considering realistic values
[4]. Thermal detuning, ∆ T, is assumed not to depend
onXsinceτ∼ps is much smaller than the temperature
diﬀusion time scale, in the order of the ns. Last, we note
that in Eq. 3we omitted a term ∼µ∂z∆T, accounting for
the heat diﬀusion along z, as its relative importance to
the other terms is of the order of ∼10−6(the thermal
diﬀusion coeﬃcient is µ≈7.25×10−7m2/s[5]).
Raman scattering is introduced via the molecular vi-
brational ﬁeld [6], previously implemented in microres-
onators [7], with standard parameter for glass given by
[8]: Raman to Kerr eﬀective fraction, fR= 0.18; inverse
phonon life-time, γR= 1/32 fs−1; natural phonon fre-
quency,ωR= 1/12.2 fs−1; and Ω r≡[γ2
R+ω2
R]1/2.
Eq.1in the main text is a particular case of the system
Eqns.2-4when higher order dispersion, Raman scatter-
ing, thermaldetuning, andpumpazimuthal’slocalisation
are disregarded ( ˆDhod=Q= ∆T= 0,ξ(X) = 1). The
time evolution of the above system, Eqns. 2-5, is simu-
lated via the fourth order Runge-Kutta method.
Computation of stationary snakes. Stationary so-
lutions (snakes or else) are obtained numerically from
Eq.1or Eqns. 2-5with the Newton-Raphson method
in the frame comoving with the nonlinear state, where
they readily satisfy ∂tψ= 0. While equation 1is already
expressed in such frame, Eqns. 2-5(expressed in the lab
frame) are rewritten into the comoving frame after the
substitution x=X−(b1,1+v)t, wherevis a velocityshift
induced by the higher order eﬀects, which is computed
together with the nonlinear solution. When computing
stationary states, the x-localisation of the pump is disre-
garded (we set ξ(X) = 1).
Stability of snakes. Linear stability analysis is per-
formed to all stationary solutions, represented by the
tuple{ψsQs,∆Ts}. Each ﬁeld in the stationary so-
lution is prone to develop instabilities. In the ini-
tial stages of such instabilities ﬁelds are regarded as
ψ=ψs+aeiλt+b∗e−iλ∗t,Q=Qs+ceiλt+c∗e−iλ∗t,
∆T= ∆Ts+deiλt+d∗e−iλ∗t(NoteQ,∆Tare real ﬁelds),
whereλare the complex eigenvalues of the Jacobian ma-
trix, obtained after substituion of the above decompo-
sition into the system of Eqns. 2-4(withξ(X) = 1)
and linearising in λ. The real parts of λ, Re(λ), are the
growth rates yielding instabilities when Re( λ)>0.11
