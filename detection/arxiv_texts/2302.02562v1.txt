LOCAL RIGIDITY OF JULIA SETS
ZHUCHAO JI AND JUNYI XIE
Abstract. We nd criteria ensuring that a local (holomorphic,
real analytic, C1) homeomorphism between the Julia sets of two
given rational functions comes from an algebraic correspondence.
For example, we show that if there is a local C1-symmetry be-
tween the maximal entropy measures of two rational functions,
then probably up to a complex conjugation, the two rational func-
tions are dynamically related by an algebraic correspondence. The
holomorphic case of our criterion will play an important role in the
authors' upcoming proof of the Dynamical Andr e-Oort conjecture
for curves.

1.Introduction
A classical problem in complex dynamics is to determine when two
rational maps of degree at least two have the same Julia set. This prob-
lem has been studied by many authors [BE87] [Bea92] [Din00] [Ere89]
[Lev90] [LP97] [SS95]. In certain situations (e.g., if the Julia set is a
circle or P1(C)), the shape of the Julia set contains few information. So
it is also interesting to ask when two rational maps have the same max-
imal entropy measure. Note that a rational map of degree at least two
has a unique maximal entropy measure. A result of Levin-Przytycki

[LP97] shows that in this case the two rational functions are dynami-
cally related by an algebraic correspondence. Such rigidity issues have
recently played important roles in arithmetic dynamics [BD11] [FG22]
[GNY19].
The rst aim of this paper is to study the following more general
question:
Question 1.1. Can we classify the local (holomorphic, real analytic,
C1) homeomorphisms between the Julia sets (or maximal entropy mea-
sures) of two given rational functions of degree at least two?
This question is inspired by [DFG22, Problem in page 3] proposed
by Dujardin-Favre-Gauthier. We expect that under reasonable condi-
tions, probably up to a complex conjugation, such two endomorphisms
aredynamically related i.e. for endomorphisms f;gonP1(C) of degree
at least 2, they are called dynamically related if there exist positive
integersaandband an irreducible algebraic curve ZinP1(C)P1(C)
such thatZis periodic under ( fa;gb). By [Xie22, Proposition 3.14.],
we may take ( a;b) = (lcmfdegf;deggg
degf;lcmfdegf;deggg
degg):Moreover, we ex-
pect thathitself comes from the algebraic correspondence Z:This lo-
cal rigidity question was recently studied by Dujardin-Favre-Gauthier
[DFG22]and by Luo [Luo21] in the holomorphic case.
Remark 1.2. We could not expect a rigidity result for local C0-
homeomorphisms. Indeed for two rational maps in the same stable
component, by -Lemma [McM16, Theorem 4.1], their maximal en-
tropy measures (hence Julia sets) are homeomorphic via a quasiconfor-
mal homeomorphism.
To state our main results, we rst introduce some notations. Let
gbe an endomorphisms on P1(C) of degree at least 2. Let gbe the
maximal entropy measure for gandJgbe the Julia set of g.
Denote bycon:P1(C)!P1(C) the anti-holomorphic bijection z7!
z:For every endomorphism gonP1(C) denote by g:P1(C)!P1(C)
the endomorphism z7!g(z):It is clear thatJg=con(Jg) and we
havecong=gcon:
Julia sets of special types. Recall the following result of Eremenko
[EVS11, Theorem 1 and the rst paragraph in page 2].
Theorem 1.3. There is an open subset VofP1(C)such thatJg\V
is not empty and contained in a C1-smooth curve if and only if Jgis
contained in a circle.3
Denition 1.4. LetCgbe the smallest real analytic subset of P1(C)
containingJf.
By Theorem 1.3, CgisP1(C) ifJgis not contained in a circle, oth-
erwise,Cgis the unique circle containing Jg:
Denition 1.5. We say thatJgissmooth if it equals to P1(C), a circle,
or a segment.
By Theorem 1.3 and [Mil11, Corollary 4.11], Jgis smooth if and if
it isC1-smooth at some point in Jg:
Denition 1.6. As in [JX22, Section 1.1], we call gexceptional if it is
a Latt es map or semiconjugates to a monomial map.
It is clear that when gis exceptional,Jgis smooth and gis equiv-
alent to the Lebesgue measure on Jg:
1.1.Main results. In our rst result, we answer Question 1.1 under
a measure theoretic assumption. The holomorphic case of Theorem
3.1 will play an important role in the authors' upcoming proof of the
Dynamical Andr e-Oort conjecture for curves [JX23].
Theorem 1.7 (Theorem 3.1, 6.1 and 7.1) .Letf;g be two endomor-
phisms on P1(C)of degree at least 2. Assume that one of them is
non-exceptional. Let (resp.) be a non-atomic invariant ergodic
probability measure with positive Lyapunov exponent of f(resp.g). Let
UP1(C)be a connected open subset such that U\Cgis connected
andU\Jg6=;. Leth:U!h(U)P1(C)be a homeomorphism such
that
(i)h(U\Jg) =h(U)\Jf; ifJfis smooth, we assume further that
h(g)/fonh(U)1;
(ii)h()is equivalent to onh(U).
Then the following statements holds:
Holomorphic case: Ifhis holomorphic, then there exist pos-
itive integers aandband an irreducible algebraic curve Zin
P1(C)P1(C)such thatZis preperiodic under (fa;gb)and
contains the graph f(h(x);x);x2Ugofh.
Real analytic case: Ifhis real analytic and orientation pre-
serving, then there exist positive integers aandband an ir-
reducible algebraic curve ZinP1(C)P1(C)such thatZis

existsc>0 such that 1=c2.4 ZHUCHAO JI AND JUNYI XIE
preperiodic under (fa;gb)and contains the graph f(h(z);z);z2
U\Cfgofh. Moreover, ifJforJgis not contained in any
circle, then his holomorphic.
C1case: IfhisC1, then up to change fto its complex conju-
gationf, there exist positive integers aandband an irreducible
algebraic curve ZinP1(C)P1(C)such thatZis periodic under
(fa;gb). Moreover, ifJforJgisP1(C), thenhis conformal.
Here a homeomorphism h:U!h(U) on a open subset Uis called
conformal ifhis holomorphic or antiholomorphic on every connected
component of U.
Remark 1.8. One may take ;to befandgrespectively. Then
Theorem 1.7 completely answers the measure version of Question 1.1
in the holomorphic and real analytic cases. Our answer in the C1case
is less precise (c.f. Remark 1.14).
Remark 1.9. The holomorphic case of Theorem 3.1 was proved earlier
by Dujardin-Favre-Gauthier [DFG22] under the following additional
assumptions: (1) hmaps a repelling periodic point of gto a preperiodic
point off; (2)=fand=g; (3)h() is strongly equivalent to
onh(U), i.e. there exists C > 0 such that1
Ch()C.
Our second result answers Question 1.1 under a non-uniform hyper-
bolic assumption (see condition (ii) in the below theorem) which is
satised by e.g. Topological Collet-Eckmann maps [PRL07, Section
1.1, Theorem E, Lemma 7.2] and Weakly Hyperbolic maps in the sense
of Rivera Letelier-Shen [RLS14, Denition 2.1 and 2.2, Corollary 6.3].
Examples of Weakly Hyperbolic maps in the sense of Rivera Letelier-
Shen can be found in [RLS14, Fact 2.4].
Theorem 1.10 (Theorem 3.2, 6.2 and 7.2) .Letf;gbe two endomor-
phisms on P1(C)of degree at least 2. Assume that one of them is
non-exceptional. Let UP1(C)be a connected open subset such that
U\Cgis connected and U\Jg6=;. Leth:U!h(U)P1(C)be a
homeomorphism such that
(i)h(U\Jg) =h(U)\Jf; ifJfis smooth, we assume further that
h(g)/fonh(U);
(ii)the Hausdor dimension of non-conical points of gis0(c.f.
Denition 3.3).
Then the following statements holds:
Holomorphic case: Ifhis holomorphic, then there exist pos-
itive integers aandband an irreducible algebraic curve Zin5
P1(C)P1(C)such thatZis preperiodic under (fa;gb)and
contains the graph f(h(x);x);x2Ugofh.
Real analytic case: Ifhis real analytic and orientation pre-
serving, then there exist positive integers aandband an ir-
reducible algebraic curve ZinP1(C)P1(C)such thatZis
preperiodic under (fa;gb)and contains the graph f(h(z);z);z2
U\Cfgofh. Moreover, ifJforJgis not contained in any
circle, then his holomorphic.
C1case: IfhisC1, then up to change fto its complex conju-
gationf, there exist positive integers aandband an irreducible
algebraic curve ZinP1(C)P1(C)such thatZis periodic under
(fa;gb). Moreover, ifJforJgisP1(C), thenhis conformal.
Remark 1.11. Since holomorphic maps are real analytic, the real an-
alytic case of Theorem 1.7 and 1.10 implies the holomorphic case. But
actually the proof of the real analytic case is based on the proof of the
holomorphic case. That is the reason we state the holomorphic case
separately.
Remark 1.12. In Theorem 1.7 and 1.10, the assumption of the non-
exceptionalness is necessary (see [DFG22, Remark 2.13]).
Remark 1.13. WhenCg6=P1(C), there are innitely many local real
analytic homeomorphisms whose restrictions to Cgare the same as h.
So in the real analytic case of Theorem 1.7 and 1.10, it is necessary to
restricthtoCg:
Remark 1.14. Ifhin the real analytic case of Theorem 1.7 (resp.
1.10), does not preserve the orientation, then conhpreserves the
orientation. So we may apply Theorem 1.7 (resp. 1.10), for f;gand
conh.
Remark 1.15. TheC1case of Theorem 1.7 and 1.10 is less precise than
the holomorphic or the real analytic case. We showed that, probably up
to a complex conjugation, fandgare dynamically related. However,
we can not show that the graph of hhas intersection with Z:
Combing the holomorphic case of Theorem 1.7 and [DFG22, Theo-
rem 4.1], we get the following consequence for polynomial maps.
Corollary 1.16. Letf;gbe two polynomial endomorphisms on P1(C)
of degree at least 2. Assume that one of gis non-exceptional and
(1) eitherJgis disconnected;
(2) orJgis connected and locally connected.6 ZHUCHAO JI AND JUNYI XIE
LetUP1(C)be a connected open subset. Let h:U!h(U)P1(C)
be a biholomorphic map such that h(U\Jg) =h(U)\Jf; ifJfis
smooth, we assume further that h(g)/fonh(U). Then there
exist positive integers aandband an irreducible algebraic curve Zin
P1(C)P1(C)such thatZis preperiodic under (fa;gb)and contains
the graphf(h(x);x);x2Ugofh.
Remark 1.17. Corollary 1.16 was proved by Luo [Luo21] in the case
wherefandgare polynomials with the same degree and Jgis con-
nected and locally connected, and it was proved by Dujardin-Favre-
Gauthier [DFG22] in the case gis a Topological Collet-Eckmann poly-
nomial (Topological Collet-Eckmann maps automatically satisfy (1) or
(2)).
Our another aim is to improve local conjugacies to algebraic cor-
respondences. For instance, we prove the rigidity of marked length
spectrums of real rational maps. See Section 4 for details.
Theorem 1.18. Letf;gbe two endomorphisms on P1(C)of degree at
least 2dened over Rsuch thatfis non-exceptional. Let Nf(resp.Ng)
beR[f1g or be a compact interval contained in R[f1g . Assume
(i)there exists a homeomorphism h:Nf!Ngsuch thathf=
ghonNf;
(ii)fjNfhas positive topological entropy and for every periodic point
x2Nfwe havejdfn(x)j=jdgn(h(x))j, wherenis the period of
x.
Then there exists an irreducible algebraic curve  P1(C)P1(C)
which is periodic under (f;g), movrover the intersection of Vand the
graph ofhcontains a Cantor set.
We also get rigidity results for conformal expanding repeller (CER)
(c.f. Theorem 4.3) and horseshoe (c.f. Theorem 6.4).
1.2.Sketch of the proof. An important idea in our proofs of The-
orem 1.7 and 1.10 is to study the dynamics at a point xwhich is
\general" in a certain sense. This idea has been already used by Levin-
Przytycki in their classication of rational maps with identical maximal
entropy measures [LP97], and this idea is also crucial in the authors'
upcoming proof of the Dynamical Andr e-Oort conjecture for curves
[JX23]. On the other hand, the strategy in [DFG22] is rather dierent.
They worked on preperiodic points and the proof involves entire curves
and positive currents.
Letf;gbe two endomorphisms on P1(C) of degree at least 2. Assume
that one of them is non-exceptional. Let UP1(C) be a connected7
open subset such that U\Cgis connected and U\Jg6=;. Leth:U!
h(U)P1(C) be a (holomorphic, real analytic, C1) homeomorphism
such thath(U\Jg) =h(U)\Jf; ifJfis smooth, we assume further
thath(g)/fonh(U).
If one off;gis exceptional, then JfandJgare smooth. Then
by [Zdu90], both of them are exceptional. So both fandgare non-
exceptional.
We dene a point in U\Jgto be bi-conical for (g;h;f ) if it is
notg preperiodic, and there are positive constants r;R;K and two
sequences of positive integers nj!+1,mj!+1,j1 such that
(i)gnj:Wj!B(gnj(x);r) is injective and WjU, whereWjis
the connected component of g nj(B(gnj(x);r)) containing x;
(ii) the map hj:=fmjhgnj:B(gnj(x);r)!P1(C) is injective
and satises
B(fmj(h(x));R=K )hj(B(gnj(x);r))B(fmj(h(x));R);
wheregnjis the inverse map of gnj:Wj!B(gnj(x);r).
Our rst step is to show the existence of bi-conical points for ( g;h;f ).
Under condition (ii) of Theorem 1.10, this is easy to show via the
constructions of CERs. Under condition (ii) of Theorem 1.7, the proof
is more delicate. In Lemma 3.14, we show that -a.e. point in Uis
bi-conical for ( g;h;f ) via ergodic theory. Moreover, the set of times
G=fni;i0gcan be asked to have positive lower density. This was
done in Section 3.
We rst prove the holomorphic case in Section 3, which is the foun-
dation of the real analytic and the C1case. Assume the existence of
a bi-conical point xfor (g;h;f ). By Montel's theorem, we can con-
struct a normal family fhi:D!P1(C)gof injective holomorphic
maps on some disk DwithD\Jg6=;and satisfy condition (i) of
Theorem 1.7 (and Theorem 1.10). Moreover, every limit of this family
is non-constant. Applying Levin's result [Lev90, Theorem 1] (see also
Theorem 5.1), we construct two horseshoes in JgandJfrespectively
and a holomorphic conjugacy between them. Applying a generalized
form (c.f. Theorem 2.2) of a theorem of Inou [Ino11, Theorem 2] based
on Eremenko's theorem [Ere89, Theorem 2] (c.f. Theorem 2.3), we
show that the conjugacy can be improved to an algebraic correspon-
dence. This implies the holomorphic case of Theorem 1.7 and 1.10.
Generalized Inou's theorem was discussed in Section 2.
There are three ingredients in the above argument which not apply
to the real analytic case directly. The rst one is Montel's theorem.8 ZHUCHAO JI AND JUNYI XIE
We replace it by Lemma 6.3. The second one is Levin's result [Lev90,
Theorem 1]. For this, we replace it by Theorem 5.3, which general-
izes [Lev90, Theorem 1] to the real analytic setting. The third one is
Theorem 2.2. We replace it by our rigidity result for horseshoes (c.f.
Theorem 6.4). This was done in Section 5 and 6.
To prove the C1case, our idea is to reduce it to the real analytic
case. From a bi-conical point xfor (g;h;f ), we construct a sequence
fhi:D!P1(C)gof injective C1-maps on some disk DwithD\
Jg6=;converging to a real analytic map Hwhich satisfyies condition
(i) of Theorem 1.7 (and Theorem 1.10). This reduces the C1case
of Theorem 1.10 to the real analytic case. The C1case of Theorem
1.7 is more delicate, since condition (ii) of Theorem 1.7 may not be
satised by H:To solve this problem, we need the fact that the times
setG=fni;i0ghas positive lower density. We construct the
sequencefhi:D!P1(C)gbased on a chosen subsequence nij;j0
ofG:One show that, under this choice, gni;j(x) converges to a point
p2Dwhich is bi-conical for ( g;H;f ) (c.f. Lemma 7.5). Then the
argument in the real analytic case can be applied to ( p;g;H;f ), which
concludes the proof. This was done in Section 7.

2.A generalized Inou's theorem
The aim of this section is to prove the following theorem, which will
be used in the proof of Theorem 3.1.
Theorem 2.1. Letf;gbe two non-Latt es endomorphisms on P1(C)of
degree at least 2. Assume that
(i)there exists a connected open set UP1(C)and an open subset
U0Usuch thatf(U0)U,f:U0!Uis non-injective, and
f:U0!Uhas a repelling xed point;
(ii)there exists a non-constant holomorphic map h:U!P1(C)
such thathf=ghonU0.
Then there exists an irreducible algebraic curve  P1(C)P1(C)
which is invariant under (f;g)and contains the graph of h.9
In [Ino11], Inou proved the above result when f:U0!Uis polynomial-
like. His proof indeed works in the general case. We give a proof of
Theorem 2.1 for the convenience of the readers. The main ingredients
of the proof are Inou's construction [Ino11, Theorem 2] and Eremenko's
theorem [Ere89, Theorem 2] as follows:
Theorem 2.2 (Inou) .Letf;gbe two endomorphisms on P1(C). Let
UP1(C)be an open set. Let h:U!P1(C)be a non-constant
holomorphic map. Let  0:=f(z;h(z)) :z2UgP1(C)P1(C)be
the graph of h. Consider the forward invariant set
  :=[
n0Fn( 0)
of the product map F:= (f;g). Then there exists a Riemann surface X
and holomorphic maps G:X!Xand:X!P1(C)P1(C)such
that(X) =   ,G=FonXand has the following properties:
(i)Leti:=pi, wherepi:P1(C)P1(C)!P1(C)is the pro-
jection to the i-th coordinate. Then there exists an open subset
VXsuch that(V) =   0and1:V!Uis biholomorphic.
(ii)The cardinality of the preimages of a point in XbyGis not
greater than degfdegg.
(iii) IfUis connected and there exists U0Usuch thatf(U0)U,
andhf=ghonU0, thenXis connected, 1G=f1
onXand2G=g2onX.
Theorem 2.3 (Eremenko) .LetR;G be two endomorphisms on P1(C)
such that degG2. Letbe a meromorphic function in Cor inC
with an essential singularity at 1. IfsatisesG=R, thenR
is a Latt es map and Gis exceptional of monomial type.
Proof of Theorem 2.1. We rst construct   0; ;X;G; i;andVas in
Theorem 2.2. We only need to show that   = (X) is an irreducible
algebraic curve in P1(C)P1(C). Once this holds, since   contains the
graph ofh, it is invariant under ( f;g).
By the assumptions (i) and (ii) of Theorem 2.1 and by Theorem
2.2,Xis connected, and G:X!Xis non-injective and has a re-
pelling xed point. Hence Xcan not be a hyperbolic Riemann surface.
ThereforeXis biholomorphic to P1(C), a torus C=,CorC.
In the rst two cases Xis projective, hence 1and2are nite
morphisms, Then   = (X) is an irreducible algebraic curve in P1(C)
P1(C). In the case X=CorC, by Theorem 2.2 (ii), Gis a polynomial

has degree at least 2. By Theorem 2.2 (iii), we have 1G=f1
onXand2G=g2onX. Sincefandgare not Latt es, by
Theorem 2.3, 1and2must be nite morphisms. Hence   = (X)
is an irreducible algebraic curve in P1(C)P1(C). This nishes the
proof. 
3.Holomorphic local rigidity of Julia sets
The aim of this section is to prove the following two theorems.
Theorem 3.1. Letf;gbe two endomorphisms on P1(C)of degree at
least 2. Assume that one of them is non-exceptional. Let (resp.
) be a non-atomic invariant ergodic probability measure with positive
Lyapunov exponent of f(resp.g). LetUP1(C)be a connected open
subset such that U\Supp6=;. Leth:U!h(U)P1(C)be a
biholomorphic map such that
(i)h(U\Jg) =h(U)\Jf; ifJfis smooth, we assume further that
h(g)/fonh(U);
(ii)h()is equivalent to onh(U).
Then there exist positive integers aandband an irreducible algebraic
curveZinP1(C)P1(C)such thatZis preperiodic under (fa;gb)and
contains the graph f(h(x);x);x2Ugofh.
Theorem 3.2. Letf;gbe two endomorphisms on P1(C)of degree at
least 2. Assume that one of them is non-exceptional . Let UP1(C)
be a connected open subset and let h:U!h(U)P1(C)be a biholo-
morphic map. Assume that
(i)h(U\Jg) =h(U)\Jf; ifJfis smooth, we assume further that
h(g)/fonh(U);
(ii)the Hausdor dimension of non-conical points of gis0.
Then there exists positive integers aandband an irreducible alge-
braic curve ZinP1(C)P1(C)such thatZis preperiodic under (fa;gb)
and contains the graph f(h(x);x);x2Ugofh.
3.1.Bi-conical points.
Denition 3.3. Letgbe an endomorphisms on P1(C) of degree at
least 2. A point x2Jgis called conical if there exists r >0 and a
sequence of positive integers nj!+1such that
gnj:Wj!B(gnj(x);r)11
is injective, where Wjis the connected component of g nj(B(gnj(x);r))
containingx.
Lemma 3.4. In the setting of Denition 3.3 we have
jdgnj(x)j!+1:
Proof. Assume by contradiction that by passing to a subsequence of
fnjgthere exists M > 0 such thatjdgnj(x)j<M . Shrinkrif necessary
such that 2r<diam (Jg). By Koebe one-quarter theorem Wjcontains
the diskD:=B(x;r=(4M)). This implies gnj(D)B(gnj(x);r) for
everyj1, contradicts to the fact Jggnj(D) whennjlarge enough.

Letf;gbe two endomorphisms on P1(C) of degree at least 2. Let
UP1(C) be an open subset and let h:U!h(U)P1(C) be a
homeomorphism.
Denition 3.5. A pointx2U\J(g) is called bi-conical for (g;h;f )
if it is notg-preperiodic, for which there are positive constants r;R;K
and two sequences of positive integers nj!+1,mj!+1,j1
such that
(i)gnj:Wj!B(gnj(x);r) is injective and WjU, whereWjis
the connected component of g nj(B(gnj(x);r)) containing x;
(ii) the map hj:=fmjhgnj:B(gnj(x);r)!P1(C) is injective
and satises
B(fmj(h(x));R=K )hj(B(gnj(x);r))B(fmj(h(x));R);
wheregnjis the inverse map of gnj:Wj!B(gnj(x);r);
It is clear that, if xis bi-conical for ( g;h;f ),h(x)2Jf.
Remark 3.6. Forn;m0, ifgn:W!B(gn(x);r) is injective and
WU, whereWis the connected component of g n(B(gn(x);r))
containing xandfmis injective on h(W), thengn(x) is bi-conical for
fmhgn, wheregnis the inverse map of gn:W!B(gn(x);r).
3.2.Holomorphic rigidity via bi-conical points.
Lemma 3.7. Letf;gbe two non-exceptional endomorphisms on P1(C)
of degree at least 2. LetUP1(C)be a connected open subset and let
h:U!h(U)P1(C)be a biholomorphic map such that h(U\Jg) =
h(U)\Jf, ifJfis smooth, we assume further that h(g)/fon
h(U). Assume that there is a point x2U\Jgwhich is bi-conical
for(g;h;f ), then Then there exists positive integers aandband an
irreducible algebraic curve ZinP1(C)P1(C)such thatZis preperiodic
under (fa;gb)and contains the graph f(h(z);z);z2Ugofh.12 ZHUCHAO JI AND JUNYI XIE
Proof. By Lemma 3.4 we have
(3.1) jdgnj(x)j!+1:
Shrinkrif necessary, we may further assume that there is C > 1
such that for every j1 we have
C 1<jdhj(x)=dhj(y)j<C
for everyy2B(gnj(x);r). By passing to a subsequence of f(nj;mj)g,
we may assume that gnj(x) converges. Then there exists a disk D0
centered at the limit point and with radius r=4. We may assume that
gnj(x)2D0for everyj1. LetDbe the disk of radius r=2 and has
the same center with D0. Then we have
B(gnj(x);r=4)DB(gnj(x);r)
for everyj1. By Montel's theorem, fhjjDgis a normal family and ev-
ery limit map in this family is non-constant. Cover Jfby nitely many
disks of radius R=(8CK). By passing to a subsequence of f(nj;mj)g,
there exists a disk Vin this nite family such that fmj(h(x))2Vfor
everyj1. By (ii) for every j1, we have
VB(fmj(h(x));R=(4CK))hj(B(gnj(x);r=4))hj(D):
For everyj1 the following maps are well dened
j:=hjh 1
1jV:V!P1(C):
By our construction jare injective holomorphic maps with bounded
distortion, moreover the diameter of j(V) are uniformly bounded form
above and from below. Then fjgis a normal family and every limit
map in this family is non-constant. By our construction, we have j(V\
Jf) =j(V)\Jf, i.e.jare local symmetries of J(f). WhenJfis
smooth, using the total invariance of maximal entropy measures, for
everyj1 we have (hj)()/onhj(D), whereandare maximal
entropy measures of gandf. As a consequence we have ( j)()/
onj(V). Now by Levin's result [Lev90, Theorem 1] (see also Theorem
5.1), since fis non-exceptional, fjgis a nite set. By passing to a
subsequence we may assume that j=j0onVfor everyjj0. This
implieshj=hj0onDfor everyjj0. Without loss of generality we
may assume j0= 1.
The denition of hj;j1 shows that
fmjhgnj=fm1hgn1
onD. By (3.1), we have mj!+1. By passing to a subsequence,
we may assume nj>max(n1;n2) andmj>max(m1;m2) for every13
j >2. Forj >2 letUjbe the connected component of g (nj n1)(D)
containinggn1(x). Thus we have
fmj m1h1=h1gnj n1
onUj. Similarly for j > 2 letU0
jbe the connected component of
gn2 nj(D) containing gn2(x). Thus we have
fmj m2h2=h2gnj n2
onU0
j. Sinceh1=h2onDwe have
fmj m2h1=h1gnj n2
onU0
j.
Sincexis not a preperiodic point, we have gn1(x)6=gn2(x). By (3.1)
we know that the diameter of UjandU0
jshrink to 0 when j!+1.
Hence we may choose p > 2 such that Up\U0
p=;andUp[U0
p
D. The two maps gnp n1:Up!Dandgnq n2:U0
p!Dare both
biholomorphic. Let
W1:=gnp n1(U0
p)Up;
wheregnp n1is the inverse map of gnp n1:Up!D, and let
W2:=gnp n2(Up)U0
p;
wheregnq n2is the inverse map of gnp n2:U0
p!D.
LetW:=W1[W2D, seta:= 2mp m1 m2andb:= 2np n1 n2,
then we have
fah1=h1gb
onW. Moreover gb:W!Dhas two repelling xed point, and is
non-injective.
By Lemma 2.1 there exists an irreducible algebraic curve   P1(C)
P1(C) which is invariant under ( fa;gb) and contains the graph of h1,
i.e. the setf(h1(w);w)2P1(C)P1(C) :w2Dg:
It remains to show the there exists an irreducible algebraic curve Z
containing the graph of hthat is preperiodic under ( fa;gb). We need
the following lemma:
Lemma 3.8. LetZP1(C)P1(C)be an irreducible algebraic curve.
Assume there exist m0andn0such that (fm;gn)(Z) =   . Then
Zis preperiodic under (fa;gb).
Proof. Passing to an iteration of ( fa;gb), we can further assume that
minfa;bg>maxfn;mg. For every l1, since   is invariant under
(fa;gb), we have
(fal;gbl)(Z) = (fa(l 1)+a m;gb(l 1)+b n)( ) = (fa m;gb n)( ):14 ZHUCHAO JI AND JUNYI XIE
This means that the ( fa;gb)-forward images of Zare all contained
in the curve ( fa m;gb n)( ), which implies that Zis preperiodic under
(fa;gb). 
LetZ0:=f(h(w);w)P1(C)P1(C) :w2Ugbe the graph of h.
Then we have
(fm1;gn1)(Z0) :
LetZbe the irreducible component of ( fm1;gn1) 1( ) containing Z0.
Since   is irreducible we have
(fm1;gn1)(Z) =  :
By the above lemma, Zis preperiodic under ( fa;gb) and contains the
graph ofh. This nishes the proof. 
3.3.Existence of bi-conical points via ergodic theory. We recall
the asymptotic density of subsets of Z>0:
Denition 3.9. LetAbe a subset of positive integers. The asymptotic
lower/upper density ofAis dened by
d(A) := lim inf
n!1jA\[0;n 1]j=n;
and
d(A) := lim sup
n!1jA\[0;n 1]j=n:
Ifd(A) =d(A), we setd(A) :=d(A) =d(A) and call it the asymptotic
density ofA.
The proof of the following lemma was implicitly contained in [LP97,
Lemma 1]. For completeness we give a proof here.
Lemma 3.10 (Levin-Przytycki) .Letgbe an endomorphism on P1(C)
of degree at least 2. Letbe ag-invariant ergodic probability measure
with positive Lyapunov exponent. Then for every  >0there isr >
0such that for -a.e.x2P1(C), there exists a subset A=Axof
positive integers such that d(A)>1 , and every n2Asatises
that if we denote by Wthe connected component of g n(B(gn(x);r))
containingx, then the map gn:W!B(gn(x);r)is biholomorphic and
has bounded distortion,
1=2<jdgn(x)=dgn(y)j<2;
for ally2W.
Proof. LetJ:= Supp. Consider the Rohlin's natural extension
(~J;~g;~) of (J;g; ). Forn2Zdenoten:~J!Jthe projection
to then-th coordinate. Then for ~ -a.e. ~x2~Jthere exists r(~x)>015
such that for every positive integer n, ifWis the connected component
ofg n(B(x;r(~x))) containing  n(~x) wherex:=0(~x), then the map
gn:W!B(x;r(~x)) is biholomorphic and has bounded distortion,
1=2<jdgn(x)=dgn(y)j<2;
for ally2W. Moreover r(~x) is a measurable function in ~ x. See
Przytycki-Urbanski [PU10, Theorem 11.2.3].
For xed>0, there isr>0 such that ~ (~F)>1 where ~F:=f~x2
~J:r(~x)> rg. By Birkho ergodic theorem, there is a subset ~Gwith
~(~G) = 1 such that for every ~ x2~G, we haved(A(~x)) = ~(~F)>1 ;

(x;Ax;r) has the bounded distortion property we need. This concludes
our proof. 
Letgbe an endomorphism on P1(C) of degree at least 2. We let L
be a constant strictly larger than the maximum of jdgjonP1(C) w.r.t.
the spherical metric. Let x2P1(C) satisfying annlog Q, where
an:= logjdgn(x)j, > 1 andQ > 0. We dene a function g;xas
follows.
Denition 3.11. The function g;x:Z0!Z0is dened as follows:
for eachm2Z0,g;x(m) is the minimal n2Z0such thatan
mlogL.
Lemma 3.12. The function g;xhas the following properties:
(i)it is strictly increasing, i.e. g;x(m+ 1)> g;x(m)for every
m2Z0;
(ii)mg;x(m)d(mlogL+Q)=loge.
Proof. We rst prove (i). By the denition of g;x, we clearly have
g;x(m+ 1)g;x(m). Assume by contradiction that g;x(m+ 1) =
g;x(m) =nfor somen2Z1. Thenan(m+ 1) logL, hence
an 1=an logjdg(gn 1(x))jmlogL;
contradicts to our assumption that g;x(m) =n.
Next we prove (ii). Since annlog Qholds for every n2Z0,
we getad(mlogL+Q)=logemlogL. The denition of Limplies that
ammlogL. This concludes the proof. 
As a direct corollary of Lemma 3.12 we have:16 ZHUCHAO JI AND JUNYI XIE
Corollary 3.13. LetAZ0be a subset such that d(A) =, where
01. Then we have:
(log=logL)d(g;x(A))d(g;x(A)):
LetUbe a connected open subset of P1(C). LetK > 1, we say a
homeomorphism h:U!h(U)P1(C) isK-biLipschitz if for every

isK-biLipschitz for some K > 1. IfhisK-biLipschitz, then for every
diskB(x;r)U, we haveB(h(x);r=K )h(D)B(h(x);Kr) for
somer>0.
Lemma 3.14. Letf;g be two endomorphisms on P1(C)of degree at
least 2. Let(resp.) be an invariant ergodic probability measure
with positive Lyapunov exponent of f(resp.g). Let(resp.) be
the Lyapunov exponent of (resp.). LetUP1(C)be a connected

Proof. LetFbe the subset Supp with(F) = 1 constructed in
Lemma 3.10 for the map g, < =logLand the radius r >0. For
x2F, the subset of Z0associated with xis denoted by Ax. Let
H:=F\U, then(H)>0. Sinceh() is equivalent to onh(U),
(h(H))>0:LetEbe the subset Supp with(E) = 1 constructed
in Lemma 3.10 for the map f,and radiusR > 0. The subset of Z0
associated with yis denoted by By. We haveE\h(H)6=;. By Birkho
ergodic theorem We can choose a point x2h 1(E\h(H)) such that
xsatisdies (i). Since is non-atomic, we can further choose xto not
beg preperiodic. Set A:=AxandB:=Bh(x).
Recall the denition of the function g;xin Denition 3.11 w.r.t. the
constantL. We set:=g;xand0:=f;h(x). We set

By our construction the condition (ii) automatically holds.
It remains to cunstruct the function , constantCand verify they

bn:= logjdfn(h(x))j. By (ii), for every n2A, we have
B(x;re an=2)WB(x;2re an);
whereWis the connected component of g n(B(gn(x);r)) containing

B(f(n)(h(x));R=(16K2L2))f(n)(h(W))B(f(n)(h(x));R);
hence (iii) holds.
Finally noticing Lis larger than the maximum of jdfjandjdgj, thus
the second part of (iv) holds by Lemma 3.12 (ii). The proof is nished.

3.4.Holomorphic rigidities.
Proof of Theorem 3.1. If one off;gis exceptional, then JfandJgare
smooth. Then by [Zdu90], both of them are exceptional. So both of
them are non-exceptional. When Jg(henceJf) is smooth, we may ask
:=fand:=g.
After shrinking U, we may assume that his biLipschitz. Then The-
orem 3.1 is a simple consequence of Lemma 3.7 and Lemma 3.14. 
Proof of Theorem 3.2. If one off;gis exceptional, then JfandJgare
smooth. Then by [Zdu90], both of them are exceptional. So both of
them are non-exceptional.
LetKbe a CER (c.f. [JX22, Denition 7.1]) of fsuch thatKh(U)
which is not a periodic orbit. Such Kalways exists, see for exam-
ple [JX22, Example 7.4]. It is well known that Khas positive Haus-
dor dimension, see Przytycki-Urbanski [PU10, Corollary 9.1.7]. Hence
h 1(K) also has positive Hausdor dimension. By our assumption (ii),
there exists a point x2U\Jgsuch thath(x)2K,xisg-conical
and is notg-preperiodic. Hence there exists r >0 and a sequence of
positive integers nj!+1such that
gnj:Wj!B(gnj(x);r)
is injective and having bounded distortion, here Wjis the connected
component of g nj(B(gnj(x);r)) containing x. ShrinkUif necessary,19
we may assume that his bi-Lipschitz. By Lemma 3.4, there exist
C1>1 andrj>0,rj!0 such that
B(h(x);rj=C1)h(Wj)B(h(x);rj):
After replacing fby a suitable iterate, we may assume that f(K) =
K:SincefjKis uniformly expanding, we know that jdfn(y)jCnfor
everyn1 andy2K, whereC > 0,>1 are constants. Moreover
d(K;C (f))>0. Pick 0< R < d (K;C (f)). Letmjbe the minimal
positivet integer such that jdfmj(h(x))jrjR=(2L), whereLis the
supremum ofjdfjonP1(C). Hence we have
R=(2Lrj)jdfmj(h(x))j<R= (2rj):
LetVjbe the connected component of f mj(B(fmj(h(x));R)). Then
fmj:Vj!B(fmj(h(x));R)
is biholomorphic for every j1. Shrink Rif necessary, by Koebe
distortion theorem, we have
1 99 99<jdfmj(h(x))=dfmj(y)j<1 + 99 99;
for ally2Vj.
LetV0
jbe the connected component of f mj(B(fmj(h(x));R=(100C1L)).
Then we have
h(Wj)B(h(x);rj)Vj
and
V0
jB(h(x);rj=L)h(Wj):
Hence the map hj:=fmjhgnj:B(gnj(x);r)!P1(C) is injective
and satises
B(fmj(h(x));R=(100C1L))hj(B(gnj(x);r))B(fmj(h(x));R);
wheregnjis the inverse map of gnj:Wj!B(gnj(x);r). By Lemma
3.7, the conclusion follows. 
4.Improve local conjugacies to algebraic
correspondences
4.1.Extend a local conjugacy on a CER. The following denition
was introduced by Sullivan [Sul86].
Denition 4.1. Letfbe an edomorphism on P1(C). An compact set
KP1(C) is called a CER of fif
(i) There exists m1 and a neighborhood VofKsuch that
fm(K) =KandK=\n0f mn(V).
(ii)fm:K!Kis expanding.20 ZHUCHAO JI AND JUNYI XIE
(iii)fm:K!Kis topologically exact, i.e. for every open set
UKthere exists n0 such that fmn(U) =K.
Theorem 4.2. Letf;gbe two non-Latt es endomorphisms on P1(C)of
degree at least 2. LetKf(resp.Kg) be an invariant CER of f(resp.
g) which is not a periodic orbit. Let U(resp.V) be a neighborhood
ofKf(resp.Kg). Leth:U!Vbe a biholomorphic map such
thathf=ghonKf. Then for every connected component U0of
Usuch thatU0\Kf6=;, there exists an irreducible algebraic curve
 P1(C)P1(C)which is periodic under (f;g)and contains the
graph ofhjU0.
Proof. LetDbe a small disk intersecting Kfsuch thatDU0. Fix a
pointx2Kf\D. Topological exactness of fjKfimplies the preimages
ofxunderfjKfare dense in Kf. Letxn2Kfsuch thatfn(xn) =x.
LetDnbe the connected component of f n(D) containing xn. Expand-
ingness offjKfimplies that diam DnC nfor someC > 0; > 1.
SinceKfis not a periodic orbit, for mlarge enough, we can choose
two pointsxm2Kf;x0
m2Kfsuch thatfm(xm) =xandfm(x0
m) =x,
moreoverDmD;D0
mD, andDm\D0
m=;, whereDm(resp
D0
m) is the connected component of f m(D) containing xm(resp.x0
m).
SetW:=Dm[D0
m. Thenfm:W!Dhas two repelling xed point
and is non-injective. Moreover hfm=gmhonKf\W. Sinceh
is holomorphic and Kf\Dis non-isolated, we have hfm=gmh
onW. By Theorem 2.1, there exists an irreducible algebraic curve
 P1(C)P1(C) which is invariant under ( fm;gm) and contains the
graph ofhjD. Then   also contains the graph of hjU0. The proof is
nished. 
The following theorem will be used in the proof of Theorem 1.18. It
can be deduced from Sullivan's rigidity theorem for non-linear CERs
[Sul86] (see [JX22, Theorem 7.7] for the precise statement and see
[PU10, Section 10.2] for a proof), together with a characterization the-
orem of linear CERs [JX22, Theorem 1.1].
Theorem 4.3. Letfandgbe two edomorphisms on P1(C)of degree at
least 2such thatfis non-exceptional. Let (f;Kf),(g;Kg)be two CERs,
f(Kf) =Kf,g(Kg) =Kg. Leth:Kf!Kgbe a homeomorphism
such thathf=ghonKf. Then the following two conditions are
equivalent
(i)for every periodic point x2Kfwe havejdfn(x)j=jdgn(h(x))j,
wherenis the period of x;21
(ii)there exist a neighborhood UofKfand a neighborhood VofKg
such thathextends to a holomorphic or antiholomorphic map
h:U!V.
Moreover, in case that any (hence every) condition of (1), (2) holds,
then we have
(iii) there is an algebraic curve  P1(C)P1(C)whose ir-
reducible components are all periodic such that the graph of
h0:Kf!Kg0is contained in  , where (g0;h0)is either (g;h)
or(g;conh).
4.2.Improve a local conjugacy on an interval.
Denition 4.4. LetMbe a smooth manifold and let XMbe a
compact subset. Let fbe a continuous map dened on a neighborhood
UofXsuch thatf(X)X. ThenXis called a repeller if there exists
an open set U0Usuch thatX=\n0f n(U0).
We need the following lemma. A proof can be found in Przytycki-
Urbanski [PU10, Lemma 6.1.2].
Lemma 4.5. LetMbe a smooth manifold and let XMbe a compact
subset. Let fbe a continuous map dened on a neighborhood UofX
such thatf(X)X. Then we have:
(i)AssumefjUis an open map. If Xis a repeller then fjXis an
open map.
(ii)Conversely if f:X!Xis distance expanding and fjXis an
open map, then Xis a repeller.
Remark 4.6. LetNbe a smooth manifold, MNbe a submanifold,
andXMbe a compact subset. Let f:N!Nbe a continuous
map such that f(M)M. Then there are two denitions for Xbeing
repellers, depending on the ambient space is MorN. In the following
we will emphasize that Kis seen as a subset of which ambient space.
Proof of Theorem 1.18. By one-dimensional Katok's theory [Gel10], pos-
itive topological entropy of f:Nf!Nfimplies that there exists a
repellerKoffjNf(here the ambient space is Nf), which is topologi-
cally exact and uniformly expanding. Passing to an iterate of fandg,
we assume Kisf-invariant and there exists a repelling f-xed point
x2K\N
f. By assumption (ii), h(x)2h(K) is a repelling xed
point ofg. LetIbe a small open interval centered at h(x). Since22 ZHUCHAO JI AND JUNYI XIE
g:h(K)!h(K) is topologically exact, one can construct the follow-
ing horseshoe map: there are two open intervals I1I,I2I,
such thatgm:I1!Iandgm:I2!Iare bijective for some m1,
moreover there exists L>1 such thatjdgm(y)j>Lfor everyy2I1[I2.
We dene
Kg:=fy2I1[I2:fmn(y)2I1[I2for everyn0g:
ThenKgis a repeller of gjNg(here the ambient space is Ng) which is
also topologically exact and unifromly expanding. Since h(K) is also
a repeller of gjNg(here the ambient space is Ng), shrink the interval
Iif necessary, we have Kgh(K). We dene Kf:=h 1(Kg). Then
Kfis a repeller of fjNf(here the ambient space is Nf) which is also
topologically exact and unifromly expanding.
By Lemma 4.5 (i), since fm(resp.gm) is an open map on a neigh-
borhood of Kf(resp.Kg),fm:Kf!Kfandgm:Kg!Kgare
open maps. Again by Lemma 4.5 (ii), Kf(resp.Kg) is a repeller of
f(resp.g), where the ambient space is P1(C). HenceKfandKgare
CERs. By Theeorem 4.3, hjKfcan be extended to a holomorphic or
antiholomorphic map ~hon a neighbprhoof UofKf. SinceKfR[1,
we can actually let ~hbe holomorphic. Thus we have ~hfm=gm~h
onKf. By Theorem 4.2, there exists an irreducible algebraic curve
 P1(C)P1(C) which is periodic under ( f;g), and contains the
graph ofhjKf. We conclude the result since by our construction, the
graph ofhjKfis a Cantor set. 
5.Variants of Levin's theorem
Letfbe an endomorphism of P1(C) of degree at least 2. Let Ube
a connected open subset of fwithU\Jf6=;:
We reformulate Levin's theorem [Lev90, Theorem 1] in the following
form.
Theorem 5.1. Letn:U!P1(C);n0be a a family of injective
holomorphic maps satisfying n!idasn!1 and 1
n(Jf) =Jf\U.
If in additionalJfis smooth, we assume further that (n)(f)/fjU.
Then either fis exceptional or n= id fornsuciently large.
A small modication of Levin's original proof implies the following
result forC1-maps.

In the rest of this section, we prove the following real analytic version
of Levin's theorem.
Theorem 5.3. Assume thatJfis not contained in any circle. Let

lemma is given by Donyi Wei.

Moreover lim

Assume further that dh(0)is invertible and fn;gnare injective, then

6.2.Real analytic rigidity of horseshoe.
Theorem 6.4. Letf;gbe two endomorphisms on P1(C)of degree at

6.3.Real analytic rigidity. We rst prove a real analytic version of
Lemma 3.7.
Lemma 6.5. Letf;gbe two non-exceptional endomorphisms on P1(C)
of degree at least 2. LetUP1(C)be an open subset such that U\Cf

phism preserving the orientation, such that h(U\Jg) =h(U)\Jf, if
Jfis smooth, we assume further that h(g)/fonh(U). Assume
that there exist a point x2U\Jgwhich is bi-conical for (g;h;f ).
Then there exist positive integers aandband an irreducible algebraic

Proof of Lemma 6.5. If one off;gis exceptional, then JfandJgare
smooth. By [Zdu90], both of them are exceptional, which contradicts
to our assumption. So both of them are non-exceptional.
IfJgis contained in a circle, by Theorem 1.3, Jfis contained in a
circle. We may assume that Cf=Cg=R[f1g:After shrinking U,
we may assume that there is a holomorphic injective map h0onUsuch
thath0=honU\(R[f1g ):After replacing hbyh0, we may assume

Now assume that Jg(henceJf) is not contained in any circle. We

Sincehpreserves the orientation, his holomorphic, which concludes

Proof of Theorem 7.2. We note that ifJforJgisP1(C), then both
of them are P1(C). The proof of Theorem 3.2 show that there is a
bi-conical point xfor (g;h;f ). Moreover, ifJf=P1(C), the CER
Kin the proof of Theorem 3.2 con be constructed in any given open
subset. So the bi-conical points for ( g;h;f ) are dense in U:As in
the proof of Theorem 7.1, one can construct a real analytic morphism
H:D!P1(C) such that H(D\Jg) =H(D)\Jf; ifJfis smooth, we
assume further that H(g)/fonH(U). Moreover, His conformal
if and only if dh(x) is conformal.
Apply the argument in the proof of Theorem 3.2 again, we show that
there is a bi-conical point yfor (g;H;f ). By Lemma 6.5, Then up to
changeftof, there exist positive integers aandband an irreducible
algebraic curve ZinP1(C)P1(C) such that Zis preperiodic under
(fa;gb). Moreover, ifJf=P1(C), thenHis conformal. Then dh(x) is34 ZHUCHAO JI AND JUNYI XIE
conformal. Since such xcan be chosen in a dense set in UandhisC1,
his conformal. This concludes the proof. 
