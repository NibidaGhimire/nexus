Cluster states are versatile quantum resources and an essential building block for measurement-
based quantum computing. The possibility to generate cluster states in specific systems may thus
serve as an indicator regarding if and to what extent these systems can be harnessed for quantum
technologies and quantum information processing in particular. Here, we apply this analysis to
networks of degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs), also called coherent Ising machines
(CIMs). CIMs are distinguished by their highly flexible coupling capabilities, which makes it possible
to use them, e.g., to emulate large spin systems. As CIMs typically operate with coherent states
(and superpositions thereof), it is natural to consider cluster states formed by superpositions of
coherent states, i.e., coherent cluster states. As we show, such coherent cluster states can, under
ideal conditions, be generated in DOPO networks with the help of beam splitters and classical
pumps. Our subsequent numerical analysis provides the minimum requirements for the generation
of coherent cluster states under realistic conditions. Moreover, we discuss how nonequilibrium pumps
can improve the generation of coherent cluster states. In order to assess the quality of the cluster-
state generation, we map the generated states to an effective spin space using modular variables,
which allows us to apply entanglement criteria tailored for spin-based cluster states.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cluster states [1] constitute a generic class of highly
entangled quantum states, which can serve as the starting
point for subsequent entirely measurement-driven univer-
sal quantum information processing [2–13]. In addition,
cluster states are useful for quantum sensing [14, 15] and
robust to specific noise sources [16, 17]. While cluster
states were originally proposed for spin systems [1, 18,
19], they are now experimentally accessible [20–29] on
a variety of different platforms. In particular, optical
cluster states [6, 20, 21, 28, 30–33] promise high coupling
flexibility and good scaling properties. As bosonic modes
are described by continuous variables, optical cluster
states are usually encoded in a subspace of the total
bosonic space. Typical choices are a few-photon Fock
space [20], a GKP-code space [9, 34], and a coherent-
state basis [35–37].
The coherent Ising machine (CIM) [38–48] is optical
hardware with the simulation of many-body spin systems
being a target application. Similar to platforms for the
generation of optical cluster states, the CIM describes
a network composed of degenerate optical parametric
oscillators (DOPOs) [49–52]. Such DOPO networks have,
∗jqyou@zju.edu.cn
†fnori@riken.jpby virtue of their highly flexible couplings among the
modes, already been successfully applied in the semi-
classical regime, e.g., to solve combinatorial optimization
problems [40–44].
In this article, we address the question of if and to
what extent the CIM can be operated and utilized in
the quantum regime. To this end, we investigate the
possibility to generate cluster states with the CIM. In
contrast to, and beyond, the production of entangled
cat states [53], the successful generation of cluster
states would provide clear evidence of the presence of
exploitable and processable quantum resources, with the
prospect of universal quantum computation looming. As
these machines generically operate with coherent states,
we focus here on coherent cluster states.
The Ising interaction, realizable by design in the
CIM, can serve as a natural basis for the generation of
cluster states [1, 54]. Moreover, CIMs associate coherent
states with different phases to different spin orientations,
which suggests a straightforward translation of spin
cluster states to coherent cluster states. However, we
must expect that the cluster-state generation is impaired
by the unavoidable presence of single-photon loss and
the related trade-off to implement in-principle adiabatic
evolutions in finite time. Here, we analyze the minimum
requirements such that the generation of cluster states
remains successful under these realistic conditions.

states [53], we employ tailored entanglement criteria
in order to assess the successful generation of coherent
cluster states. This allows us to certify the presence
of cluster states even if the states generated under
realistic conditions are imperfect and mixed. While the
entanglement criteria designed for cluster states typically
assume spin-like Hilbert spaces [55–62] and thus cannot
be directly applied to coherent cluster states, we use
modular variables [63] in order to map coherent states
and cat-like states to effective spin states [64–68]. In
these effective spin spaces, we can apply the entangle-
ment criteria for spin cluster states in order to certify
the presence of coherent cluster states. Indeed, modular
variables have already been successfully deployed for the
detection of entanglement in non-Gaussian states [69–73].
This article is structured as follows: We first introduce
the theoretical model in the ideal case. Next, we derive
the conditions for the generation of coherent cluster
states in DOPOs in the presence of detrimental effects,
in particular, single-photon loss and nonadiabatic evolu-
tion. To this end, the generated candidate cluster states
are mapped onto effective spin spaces using modular
variables and evaluated with an entanglement criterion
for spin cluster states. After studying and optimizing
the influences of different parameters, we finally discuss
the potential benefits of nonequilibrium pumps.
II. THEORETICAL MODEL
A. Structure of DOPO networks in CIMs
To explore the extension of cluster states to DOPO
systems, let us begin by reviewing the theoretical model
of DOPO networks in a CIM. A DOPO system consists
of a nonlinear component and a cavity [49–52]. In
particular, DOPOs within a CIM are implemented using
a nonlinear waveguide and a fiber cavity, as illustrated inFig. 1(a). The optical modes correspond to signal pulses
traveling in the optical fiber loop. When a signal pulse
interacts with the nonlinear waveguide, it couples to the
pump pulse through the following Hamiltonian (we set
ℏ= 1):
Hnl=gnl(a2
sa†
p+a†
s2ap), (1)
where asandapcorrespond to the annihilation operator
of the signal mode and the annihilation operator of the
pump mode, respectively. If the length of the nonlinear
wave guide is short or the loss for the pump mode is
strong, the pump mode in Eq. (1) can be adiabatically
eliminated. Such an adiabatic model can be described by
a two-photon pump
H=−iS[(a†
s)2−(as)2], (2)
and two-photon loss [74–80],
Ltp(ρ) =Γd
2[2asasρ(t)a†
sa†
s− {a†
sa†
sasas, ρ(t)}],
(3)
where {•,•}denotes the anti-commutator, and ρis the
density matrix of the signal mode. Note that we omit the
subscript “s” in the following part. Such a DOPO has
a steady-state space formed by the superposition of two
coherent states with different phases (i.e., a cat state),
|Ψ(t→ ∞ )⟩=C+|α⟩+C−| −α⟩. (4)
The complex amplitude αof the coherent states is given
byα=i√2SΓd. In the presence of single-photon loss,
Ls(ρ) =Γd
2[2aρ(t)a†− {a†a, ρ(t)}],
(5)
the steady states are usually mixed states:
ρ(t→ ∞ ) =P+|α⟩⟨α|+P−| −α⟩⟨−α|. (6)
This subspace can be used to emulate a spin,
|α⟩ ←→ | ↑⟩ ,| −α⟩ ←→ | ↓⟩ , (7)
for large amplitudes, |α| ≫ 1 or|⟨α| −α⟩| ∼ 0. Note
that, for general values of α, two cat states with different
parities can alternatively be used to express spins.
The coupling between different effective spins in a CIM
is realized by an optical coupling module as illustrated in
Fig. 1(a). Two common design principles for the optical
coupling modular are the optical delay-line structure [40]
and the measurement-feedback structure [41]. The opti-
cal delay-line coupling can be described by a collective
loss, e.g.,
Lc(ρ) = Γ c(ai+aj)ρ(t)(a†
i+a†
j)
−Γc
2{(a†
i+a†
j)(ai+aj), ρ(t)}, (8)3
where iandjcorrespond to two different DOPO modes.
In contrast, the measurement-feedback coupling can be
expressed as classical pumps on different modes:
HMF=X
iΩi(X1, . . .)(ai+a†
i), (9)
where Xjis the result of a measurement (usually a
position measurement) on the jth DOPO mode, and
Ωi(X1, . . .) is the measurement-based pump intensity on
theith mode.
Note that the current CIM design does not contain
direct coupling, i.e., ( aia†
j+a†
jai), but such coupling can
be realized by a small loop structure, as illustrated in
Fig. 1(b).
B. Coherent cluster states in DOPOs
Cluster states [1] are a class of highly entangled
states that can be used for measurement-based quantum
information processing. A typical (one-dimensional) 1-
D spin cluster state with Nsites assumes the following
form:
|Cluster ⟩N
s=1
2N/2NO
i=1(σ(i+1)
z| ↑i⟩+| ↓i⟩).(10)
By design, these states satisfy a recursive decomposition
property under local measurements,
⟨↓k|Cluster ⟩N
s=1
2N/2(k−1)O
i=1(σ(i+1)
z| ↑⟩i+| ↓⟩i)
NO
i=k+1(σ(i+1)
z| ↑⟩i+| ↓⟩i)
=1√
2|Cluster ⟩k−1
s⊗ |Cluster ⟩N−k
s.
(11)
In particular, this implies that cluster states can, in
general, remain entangled after local measurements.
Based on these optical spins in Eq. (7), it is now
straightforward to formulate the corresponding coherent
cluster states,
|Cluster ⟩N
co=1
2N/2+εNO
i=1ai+1
α|αi⟩+| −αi⟩
,(12)
where εaccounts for the nonvanishing overlap between
|α⟩, and|−α⟩, and the subscript “co” stands for coherent
cluster state. Specifically, the coherent cluster state for
the two-mode case, which we will consider in more detail
below, takes the following form:
|Cluster ⟩2
co=1
2 +ε′(|α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩+|α⟩ ⊗ | − α⟩
+| −α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ − | − α⟩ ⊗ | − α⟩).(13)C. Generation of coherent cluster states
Spin cluster states can be generated by utilizing the
Ising interaction between different spins [1, 54]. Accord-
ing to this method, Nspins or qubits are first prepared
in the ground state |01⟩ ⊗ |02⟩. . .⊗ |0N⟩. A rotation
Ux= exp( iPN
n=1σ(n)
xπ/2) is then applied to all the
qubits to transform the state into
|+⟩ ≡1
2N/2(| ↑⟩+| ↓⟩)⊗(| ↑⟩+| ↓⟩). . . . (14)
Finally, the Ising interaction is applied, described by the
Hamiltonian
Hs−int=gX
<i,j>1 +σ(i)
z
21−σ(j)

2. (15)
Note that the subscript “s-int” denotes the spin interac-
tion. A typical choice of iandjis nearest neighbors, i.e.,
j=i+1, in which case the following cluster state can be
generated:
|Cluster ⟩s= exp( −iπ
gHs−int)|+⟩
=1
2N/2NO
i=1(σ(i+1)
z| ↑⟩+| ↓⟩).(16)
A similar state generation protocol can be realized
with DOPOs. Recall that a single DOPO initialized
in the vacuum state assumes a cat state as the steady
state. Correspondingly, Nindependent DOPOs assume
a steady state similar to |+⟩in Eq. (14):
|+cat⟩ ≡1
(2 +εmc)N/2NO
i=1(|α⟩+| −α⟩). (17)
Moreover, the nearest-neighbor Ising interaction Hamil-
tonian (15) can be realized by beam splitters and classical
pumps in the adiabatic limit [79],
σzdt∼1
2αa†dt+ H.c.,
σ(i)
zσ(j)
zdt∼1
2αα∗(aia†
j+a†
iaj)dt, (18)
with the complex amplitude αof the optical spin (7).
The classical pump term,
1/(2α)(a†+a),
can be realized by the feedback (9) in the current CIM
design framework, while the beam splitter coupling,
1/(2αα∗)(aia†
j+a†
iaj),
is distinct from both above mentioned coupling methods
in the CIM. Such a coupling can be realized by a loop
structure as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). This structure4
can be either directly inserted into the main loop in
Fig. 1(a) or attached as a parallel pass way through
optical switchers [81].
Accordingly, the Ising interaction Hamiltonian can be
implemented through
Hco−int=gc
8αX
i
a†
i−a†
i+1+1

.
(19)
Here, the subscript “co-int” denotes the coherent-state
interaction. Coherent cluster states are now generated
as
ρCluster =Zπ
gc
0ds{−i[Hco−int+H, ρ(s)] +Ld(ρ(s))}+ρ(0)
(20)
with
ρ(0)≡ |+cat⟩⟨+cat|.
Note that the effective coherent Ising interaction (19)
requires the evolution to be adiabatic, gc≪Γd. There-
fore, ideal coherent cluster states cannot be generated in
practice, due to the finite evolution time and the presence
of single-photon loss. To characterize the generated im-
perfect cluster states, we use an entanglement criterion,
which we introduce next.
D. Cluster-state entanglement verification with
modular variables
The entanglement of spin cluster states can be detected
with the respective stabilizer entanglement criterion for
cluster states [56, 60]. Specifically, a state of Nspins
exhibits cluster-state entanglement if the entanglement
witness Wsatisfies
W ≡X
n⟨σ(n−1)
z σ(n)
xσ(n+1)
z⟩2≥N
2, (21)
σ(−1)
z =σ(N+1)
z =I.
By construction, an ideal 1-D cluster state (10) with
Nspins satisfies the entanglement witness (21). More
generally, imperfect, mixed states still satisfy the witness
as long as they maintain essential characteristics of
cluster states. We thus can take the entanglement
witness (21) in order to assess the presence of cluster
states even if the actual generated states are imperfect
and mixed. In contrast to other proximity measures, such
as the fidelity, satisfaction of the entanglement witness
here provides a clear division between “cluster state-like”
and not.
Due to the similarity between the spin cluster states
(10) and the coherent cluster states (12), it is natural to
extend the spin-based criterion (21) to DOPO systems.

evenoddFIG. 2. Mapping a bosonic mode (i.e., a continuous-variable
system) onto an effective spin using modular variables. The
continuous variable is split into integer parts (dashed boxes)
and modular parts (wave functions in different boxes). By
tracing out the modular parts, the continuous variable is then
mapped to a discrete-level chain (dashed boxes). This chain is
then further restructured as a chain of cells with two internal
levels. The latter internal space constitutes an effective spin.
However, the respective entanglement criterion cannot
be based on a naive mapping according to Eq. (7), as
the latter is not applicable to general continuous-variable
states. To obtain a generally valid procedure, we use the
fact that effective Pauli operators for continuous variables
can be formulated as [63, 82]
¯σx≡cos(ˆpl)−isin(ˆpl)sin(πˆx/l)
|sin(πˆx/l)|,
¯σy≡sin(ˆpl) +icos(ˆpl)sin(πˆx/l)
|sin(πˆx/l)|,
¯σz≡sin(πˆx/l)
|sin(πˆx/l)|. (22)
By construction, these operators have the same commu-
tation relation as the Pauli matrices σx,σy, and σz.
Based on this correspondence, we can in principle
evaluate the stabilizer entanglement criterion (21) with
continuous-variable states directly, by substituting the
operators (22). It is more instructive and practical, how-
ever, to map the continuous-variable state to an effective
spin state first, and then to evaluate (21). Specifically,
we identify a decomposition of the continuous variable
such that the effective Pauli operators (22) satisfy
¯σx=σx⊗Ianci,
¯σy=σy⊗Ianci,
¯σz=σz⊗Ianci, (23)
that is, after tracing out the ancilla space, we preserve
the Pauli algebra in the effective spin space.
To determine the ancillary space, we consider the
position basis and express the position eigenstates using
modular variables [63–68]:
|¯x⟩ ⊗ |Nx⟩ ≡ |x= ¯x+lxNx⟩, (24)
with Nxbeing the integer and the modular variable x∈
(0, lx], as illustrated in Fig. 2. While the choice of lx5
is in principle arbitrary, there exists an optimal value to
capture the spin properties of the optical spins in Eq. (7),
e.g., the separation of the wave packets in Fig. 2. This
optimal value is usually
lopt
x= 2√
2α (25)
for real α.
A continuous variable system can now be mapped onto
a discrete system by tracing out the modular part:
ρdiscrete =Zlx
0d¯x⟨¯x|ρ|¯x⟩. (26)
The integer variable Nxcan be further regrouped into a
chain of cells with two internal states each,
|m⟩cell⊗ |n⟩es≡ |Nx= 2m+n+ 1⟩, (27)
with mbeing the integer cell index and the internal state
label n= 0,1. By tracing out the cell space |m⟩cell, we
then obtain an effective spin state:
ρes=X
m⟨m|cellρdiscrete |m⟩cell
=X
mZlx
0d¯x⟨m|cell⊗ ⟨¯x|ρ|¯x⟩ ⊗ |m⟩cell.(28)
This mapping hence allows us to reinterpret arbitrary
continuous-variable states ρas effective spin states ρes,
including the steady states of DOPOs. In particular, with
the choice (25), the mapping (7) is recovered. Finally, it
is straightforward to verify that
¯σz|¯x⟩ ⊗ |m⟩cell⊗ |n⟩es=−1n|¯x⟩ ⊗ |m⟩cell⊗ |n⟩es,
¯σx|¯x⟩ ⊗ |m⟩cell⊗ |n⟩es=|¯x⟩ ⊗ |m⟩cell⊗ |1−n⟩es,
¯σy|¯x⟩ ⊗ |m⟩cell⊗ |n⟩es=−1ni|¯x⟩ ⊗ |m⟩cell⊗ |1−n⟩es.
(29)
This shows that the mapping (28) indeed satisfies the
condition (23), where the ancillary space is composed of
the modular space and the cell space,
Ianci≡X
mZlx
0d¯x|m⟩cell⊗ |¯x⟩⟨¯x| ⊗ ⟨m|cell.
III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS FOR
COHERENT-CLUSTER-STATE GENERATION
In this section, we employ numerical simulations to
investigate the generation of coherent cluster states in
DOPOs. In the following, we focus on the simplest case
of two modes, which is expected to provide lower bounds
on the parameter requirements. We also set the two-
photon loss rate to be Γ d= 1.

into a pumping stage and an interaction stage ( N= 2).
Depicted is the fidelity with respect to the ideal coherent
cluster state in Eq. (13) as a function of time, in the absence
of single-photon loss.
A. Basic picture without single-photon loss
We first consider the case without single-photon loss,
which provides insight into the mechanism of generating
coherent cluster states. The system is described by
two DOPOs initially in the vacuum state. The two-
photon pumps (2) and the two-photon losses (3) in each
DOPO drive the total system into a separable two-
mode cat state (17). After a time period Tp= 3Γ−1
d,
we further introduce the coherent Ising interaction (19)
to generate the targeted coherent cluster state (13).
Figure 3 exemplifies such a process.
At the initial time in Fig. 3, the fidelity is very low
because the vacuum state is almost orthogonal to the
coherent cluster state. The system begins to approach
the target state during the pump part and reaches a
steady fidelity around 0 .25, which is about the fidelity be-
tween the direct product of two cat states and a coherent
cluster state. When the coherent Ising interaction terms
(19) are turned on, the fidelity continues to increase
and finally reaches a value close to unity. Figure 3
thus shows that coherent cluster states can be generated
based on the coherent Ising interaction, with the latter
being realizable with only beam-splitter interactions and
classical pumps only. Note that the interacting part here
is not sufficiently slow to achieve the fidelity 1.
The adiabatic requirement gc≪Γdfor the effective
Ising interaction (19) has a strong effect on generating
coherent cluster states. To see this, we consider in Fig. 4
the influence of gcon the values of different qualifiers
for quantum states. The duration of the pumping part
is fixed to be 3Γ−1
d, which is large enough according to
Fig. 3. Note that the interaction strength gcdecides
the speed of the cluster-state generation, because the
interacting time is t=π/gc.6

FIG. 4. Influence of the effective Ising interaction strength
(which controls the generation speed) gcon the coherent-
cluster-state generation ( N= 2), as reflected by the fidelity,
the purity, and the cluster-state entanglement witness W.
Here the duration of the pumping part is 3Γ−1
d, the two-
photon pumping intensity is S=−1, and the duration of
the Ising interaction part is t=π/gc.
In Fig. 4(a), we can see that entanglement can always
be detected for different choices of Γ d/gc, when a compar-
atively good separable cat state has been generated in the
pumping part. The value of the qualifier decreases with
growing Γ d/gcfor large gc, which seems to contradict the
adiabatic requirement. However, note that the change in
the entanglement qualifier is not directly related to the
quality of the cluster state unless the threshold ( W= 1)
is crossed. In addition, the qualifier Wdoes not reach
the ideal value of 2 in the limit of vanishing gc. This
can be traced back to two different issues. First, the
ideal coherent cluster state (13) is not a perfect cluster
state due to the overlap between |α⟩and| −α⟩. Second,
the approximate separable cat state generated in the
pumping part is not sufficiently pure.
To better clarify these points, we show in Fig. 4(b) the
corresponding purity and fidelity evolution. The fidelity
with respect to an ideal coherent cluster state (green solid
curve) always increases with decreasing gc. This result
is consistent with the adiabatic requirement. The purity
of the state (red dashed curve) can provide more insight
into this adiabatic requirement. It is not surprising to see
a nearly pure state in the slow limit because in this limit
the effective Ising interaction in Eq. (19) is equivalent to
an exact Ising interaction Hamiltonian. When gcis very
large, the purity is also high. In this short-time limit, the
two-photon loss has little influence on the system state.
However, the purity drops significantly for moderate gc.

cat state with α=ip
2S/Γd.
In this regime, the nonadiabatic effects drive the system
out of the dark space generated by the two-photon loss
and the two-photon pump, so the purity is reduced by
the two-photon loss. Although a high purity does not
ensure a large qualifier Wor higher entanglement, it may
provide more insight into the counter-intuitive results
displayed in Fig. 4(a).
Next, we express the state within the effective spin
space according to Eq. (28) and calculate the fidelity of
this reduced state with respect to the reduced state of an
ideal coherent cluster state (13) [black dotted curve in
Fig. 4(b)]. This reduced fidelity exhibits the same trend
dependence versus gcas the entanglement qualifier W.
Although the state generated with a large gcdiffers from
the ideal coherent cluster state (green solid curve), these
two states become similar in the reduced space (black
dotted curve). Accordingly, the reduced space appears
robust to specific imperfections as the effective spin does
not depend on the details of the continuous variables
in the modular position space |¯x⟩. In the slow limit,
although the states generated are very close to an ideal
coherent cluster state, the difference is enlarged in the
reduced space.
From Fig. 4, we can conclude that the intuitive
mapping between the coherent states and the spins is in
general correct. However, an exact mapping, as described
by Eq. (28), can in general provide more precise results.
In addition to the coupling strength gc, the amplitude
of the coherent state |α|can also influence the effective
rotation. Although a larger-scale |α|can make the
state more vulnerable to single-photon loss, it may also
improve the cluster-state generation. The adiabatic ap-
proximation can be improved due to the coefficient gc/α,
and the precision of the coherent-to-spin mapping is
influenced by the overlap |⟨−α|α⟩|. We demonstrate this7

pumping intensities S(recall that α=ip

Fig. 5.
As the pumping intensity can also influence the quality
of the cat state generated for a given time [83], we do not
consider the pumping part and set the initial state to be
a two-mode separable cat state (17) with α=ip
2S/Γd
and N= 2. Figure 5 shows that the qualifier W
significantly increases for larger |S|. We stress that the
value of Wdoes not quantify the amount of entanglement
but merely ensures entanglement when surpassing the
threshold of 1. However, a larger Wcan be more robust
to single-photon loss if the influence of the single-photon
loss rate Γ sonWis continuous. Therefore, there should
be an optimal value of Sfor which the single-photon loss
is included.B. The optimal parameters with single-photon loss
Cat-like states are usually vulnerable to single-photon
loss [83–87]; similarly, the single-photon loss represents
the main detrimental effect in coherent-cluster-state gen-
eration. We describe the effects of the single-photon loss
with the following Lindblad terms:
Ls(ρ) =2X

(30)
where we assume the same single-photon loss rate Γ sfor
the two modes in Fig. 6. We numerically simulate the
process described in Fig. 3 and show the value of the
entanglement qualifier Wat the end of the evolution.
In Fig. 6(a), we consider a weak single-photon loss
(Γs= 0.01Γ d). In this case, the condition for entan-
glement generation is quite simple. When the pumping
time Tpis short, we need a longer interaction time π/gc.
For a short interaction time π/gc, a longer pumping time
Tpis required. Extending the duration for either the
pumping part or the interacting part does not prevent
entanglement generation. This result is similar to the
ideal case: A higher-quality separable cat state can be
generated in the pumping stage with a longer time,
and weak interaction terms better satisfy the adiabatic
condition.
In Fig. 6(b), the single-photon loss rate is Γ = 0 .02Γ d,
which results in a different trend for entanglement gener-
ation. There are two boundary curves in Fig. 6(b). The
lower boundary is similar to the boundary in Fig. 6(a)
except for the large- gclimit, where increasing the du-
ration of the interaction part can prevent entanglement
generation. The upper boundary is not shown in Fig. 6(a)
but should also exist for larger Tpandg−1
c. Note that
the single-photon loss usually prohibits entanglement in
the long-time limit. For most of this upper boundary,
entanglement generation can be prevented by increasing
either π/gcorTp. Therefore, the lower boundary is
related to the breakdown of the steady-state condition
and the adiabatic condition, so that parameters near this
boundary prefer a slower evolution; the upper boundary,
in contrast, is a consequence of the single-photon loss,
so that a faster evolution can improve the coherent-
cluster-state generation. The opposite trends at the
two boundaries at large values of gccan be seen as the
result of the nonadiabatic effects and the two-photon loss,
indicated in Fig. 4(a).
In Fig. 6, we can see that the pumping times around
ΓdTp∼1.5 are less affected by the single-photon loss.
Therefore, we choose two different values of Γ dTp, and
show the influence of the single-photon loss rate Γ sand
the interaction strength Γ d/gcin Fig. 7. In Figs. 7(a)
and 7(b), the entanglement boundaries have similar
shapes, although entanglement is generated with a higher
single-photon loss rate in Fig. 7(a). Therefore, there
can be an optimal value of Tpwhile the mechanism for8

cluster-state generation remains the same. However, the
value of gcmay influence the mechanism for cluster-
state generation, as both boundaries in Fig. 7 can be
divided into two parts. When Γ d/gcis smaller than 0 .5,
we see fast drops in the boundary curves. After this
value, the curves change less significantly with Γ d/gc.
Similar changes around Γ d/gc∼0.5 are observed in
Figs. 4, 5, and 6. Note that the (approximate) coherent
cluster states generated in the fast limit are more robust
to single-photon loss, although they exhibit a reduced
quality in the ideal limit of vanishing single-photon loss.
The highest single-photon rate in Fig. 7, under which
entanglement can be generated, is about 0 .03Γ d. This
value is lower than the one for the entangled-cat-state
generation [53], but at the same order of magnitude.
Therefore, the coherent-cluster-state generation, while
being more vulnerable to single-photon loss compared
to the entangled-cat-state generation, imposes a similar
requirement on the control of the single-photon loss.

which can generate detectable entanglement for a wide

photon loss shown for large values of gcin Fig. 8, we
can also find a shift of the optimal Sto a larger value
in Fig. 8(b). This shift is the result of less single-photon
loss due to a shorter interaction duration π/gc. Note
that the entanglement qualifier Wprefers large pumping
intensities |S|in the ideal case as shown in Fig. 5.
In this section, we considered the coherent-cluster-
state generation in the presence of single-photon loss.
We find that, to achieve a higher tolerance to the single-
photon loss, there are optimal values of the pumping time
Tpand the pumping intensity S, which are both between
Γdand 2Γ d. A fast effective Ising interaction is always
preferable in the presence of single-photon loss, in spite
of the detrimental nonadiabatic effects.
C. Effects of nonequilibrium pumping
It has been shown that nonequilibrium pump fields
can be used in DOPO systems to improve the cat-
state generation [88]. We now demonstrate that asimilar improvement can be achieved for the generation
of coherent cluster states.
The effects of the equilibrium model (2) and (3) can
also be realized by a cyclic model:

Here gnlis the nonlinear interaction strength, bnis
the annihilation operator of the pump mode of the
nth DOPO mode, and |αp⟩cis the direct product of
two pump-mode states. The loss can be described by
additional Lindblad terms in Eq. (31):

with ρn(0) = ρn⊗ |αp⟩c⟨αp|candρn+1= Tr b{ρn(tnl)}.
The amplitudes of the pump modes are chosen to gen-
erate steady DOPO amplitudes αi=√
2. We set the
duration of the nonlinear pumping for each cycle to be
tnl= 0.5g−1
nl. Instead of the pumping time Tpand the
interaction time π/gcused in the previous sections, we
describe the duration of each part with the number of
pumping cycles Npand the number of interaction cycles
Ni. The initial state is assumed to be a vacuum state.
In the pumping part, the system experiences the cyclic
dynamics (32) for Npcycles. In the interacting part, the
system dynamics is described by cycles composed of two
parts. The first part is described by Eq. (32), which
contains single-photon loss. The second part, which lasts
for the time period t=π/(gcNi), consists of the beam-
splitter interaction and the classical pumping as shown
in Eq. (19). To simplify the problem, we assume gcis
sufficiently large that we can ignore the influence of the
single-photon loss in this part. Note that the interaction
can be adiabatic with a large gcif we have a large Ni.
After Nicycles of interaction dynamics, we calculate
the entanglement qualifier W. For an easier comparison
with the adiabatic results described in Eqs. (2) and (3),
we assume the ratio between the adiabatic two-photon
loss rate Γ dand the nonlinear coupling intensity gnlis
the same as in the experiment [89], i.e., gnl= 15Γ d.
However, note that the nonequilibrium pumping cannot
be characterized by an effective two-photon loss rate Γ d.
In Fig. 9(a), we set ( Np= 9), which is sufficiently large
to obtain a good two-mode separable cat state according10
to our previous work [88], and consider the influence
of the number of interaction cycles Nion the cluster-
state entanglement witness. Similar to Fig. 7, a “fast”
effective Ising interaction is preferable for generating
entanglement under high single-photon loss rates Γ s. We
find that the highest tolerated single-photo loss rate is
about 7 times larger by introducing the nonequilibrium
pumping method. In Fig. 9(b), we consider the influence
of the number of pumping cycles Np. The number of
interacting cycles is set to be the optimal value ( Ni= 1)
as found in Fig. 9(a). The tolerance to the single-photon
loss can be further enhanced by choosing an optimal Np
according to Fig. 9(b). Note that the curves in Fig. 9
are not smooth because both NpandNican take only
integer values.
D. Discussion of the required parameters
Based on our numerical results, it can be concluded
that a minimum nonlinear coupling strength of approx-
imately gnl≈20Γ sis required for generating coherent
cluster states. Achieving such a nonlinearity-to-loss ratio
is challenging in current CIMs and DOPO systems based
on periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveg-
uides. Considering the achievable parameters in PPLN,
the highest nonlinear coupling strength gnlranges from
0.01Γ sto 0.1Γs[90–92]. To attain the required parameter
range in PPLN systems, potential solutions include using
high-quality PPLN waveguides or employing shorter op-
tical pulses. Another approach is to modify the structure
of the existing CIMs, which would not require significant
improvements in experimental technology. While current
CIMs operate above threshold, it has been successfully
demonstrated that optical cluster states can be generated
in DOPO systems below threshold [25]. Therefore,
adjusting the working regime could potentially reduce
the parameter requirements. Alternatively, Josephson
parametric oscillators [93, 94], known for their high
nonlinearity-to-loss ratio, could be utilized to construct
CIMs in the microwave regime.IV. CONCLUSIONS
We investigated the generation of coherent cluster
states in DOPO networks with effective optical Ising
interactions. DOPO networks can produce coherent
cluster states based on the generation of separable cat
states, beam-splitter interactions, and classical pumping.
These coherent cluster states can be mapped to an
effective spin Hilbert space formed by modular variables.
In this effective spin Hilbert space, we can apply the
entanglement criteria designed for spin systems to assess
the quality of the state generation in the presence
of detrimental effects, e.g., single-photon loss, overlap
between coherent states, or nonadiabatic effects.
As a paradigmatic example, we considered the case
of two modes, which can be expected to deliver lower
bounds on the parameter requirements. We applied the
respective stabilizer entanglement criterion to explore
the parameter regime that supports the coherent-cluster-
state generation. Our results indicate that the single-
photon loss acceptable for cluster-state generation must
remain below about one third of the single-photon loss
that is acceptable for the entangled-cat-state generation.
In addition, we found that a nonequilibrium pump can
significantly raise the threshold for the coherent-cluster-
state generation, with tolerable single-photon loss rates
that are about one order of magnitude larger.
This work may help us to explore the quantum
properties of, and possibly to realize one-way quantum
computation in, DOPO networks, such as coherent Ising
machines. Moreover, we hope that our analysis can
contribute to elucidating the properties of coherent-state
coding spaces.
