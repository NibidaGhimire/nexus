Abstract. We present the integrated 3-point correlation functions (3PCF) involving both the cosmic
shear and the galaxy density fields. These are a set of higher-order statistics that describe the
modulation of local 2-point correlation functions (2PCF) by large-scale features in the fields, and
which are easy to measure from galaxy imaging surveys. Based on previous works on the shear-only
integrated 3PCF, we develop the theoretical framework for modelling 5 new statistics involving the
galaxyfieldanditscross-correlationswithcosmicshear. Usingrealisticgalaxyandcosmicshearmocks
from simulations, we determine the regime of validity of our models based on leading-order standard
perturbation theory with an MCMC analysis that recovers unbiased constraints of the amplitude of
fluctuationsparameter Asandthelinearandquadraticgalaxybiasparameters b1andb2. UsingFisher
matrix forecasts for a DES-Y3-like survey, relative to baseline analyses with conventional 3 ×2PCFs,
we find that the addition of the shear-only integrated 3PCF can improve cosmological parameter
constraints by 20−40%. The subsequent addition of the new statistics introduced in this paper can
lead to further improvements of 10−20%, even when utilizing only conservatively large scales where
the tree-level models are valid. Our results motivate future work on the galaxy and shear integrated
3PCFs, which offer a practical way to extend standard analyses based on 3 ×2PCFs to systematically
probe the non-Gaussian information content of cosmic density fields.arXiv:2305.17132v1  [astro-ph.CO]  26 May 2023Contents

1 Introduction
Three popular 2-point statistics employed in weak gravitational lensing surveys are: (i) the 2-point
cosmic shear correlation function ξ±, (ii) the angular clustering of foreground lens galaxies ξg, and
(iii) the average tangential shear signal of source galaxies around foreground lens galaxies ξt. Together
they are known as the 3 ×2-point correlation functions (3 ×2PCFs), jointly probing projections of the
late-time power spectrum of matter and galaxy density perturbations. These statistics form a key
analysis tool in current surveys such as DES [1], KiDS [2], HSC-SSP [3], and are expected to continue
toprovideeventighterconstraintsoncosmologicalparameterswhenupcomingmissionslikeEuclid[4],
Vera Rubin’s LSST [5] and the Nancy Roman Space Telescope [6] go online. However, the late-time
matter and galaxy density fields are non-Gaussian distributed [7] and thus have information contained
in higher-order moments that are not captured by 2-point correlation functions alone. Hence, going
beyond 2-point statistics and investigating higher-order correlation functions is of great interest as
theycan enableeven tighterconstraints oncosmologicalparameters. Effortsonthis frontusing cosmic
shear or galaxy data include the 3-point cosmic shear correlation functions (3PCF) and third-order
aperture mass moments [8–13], galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing [14, 15], density-split statistics [16–19],

the lensing aperture mass and convergence PDF [20–22], third-order convergence moments [23, 24]
and shear peak statistics [25–27]. These works focus mostly on cosmic shear data, with only a few
analysing the galaxy and shear fields together. In particular, a robust framework for joint galaxy and
shear cross-correlation analyses for a higher-order equivalent to the 3 ×2PCFs that can be directly
applied to galaxy imaging data to obtain improved cosmological constraints has not been developed
so far.
Previous works [28–30] have developed a practical higher-order cosmic shear 3-point statistic
called the integrated shear 3-point correlation function ζa±, which measures the correlation of the
1-point lensing aperture mass and position-dependent cosmic shear 2-point correlation function mea-
sured within sub-patches of the sky.1This statistic admits a well defined physical interpretation as
the modulation of the small-scale shear 2PCF by long-wavelength features of the cosmic shear field.
In this paper, we extend this framework to also include the projected foreground galaxy density field
and its cross-correlations with the shear field at the integrated 3PCF level. The new integrated 3PCFs
that we introduce in this paper are obtained by (i) measuring a position-dependent shear 2PCF, a
position-dependent galaxy 2PCF, and a position-dependent tangential shear signal (i.e. a galaxy-shear
cross-2PCF) within survey patches, and then (ii) correlating each of them with either a 1-point lensing
aperture mass Maor a 1-point average number density of lens galaxies Mgmeasured at the same
patch locations. This yields a total of 6 galaxy and shear integrated 3-point correlation functions ζ,
as illustrated in Fig. 1.

– 2 –and evaluate them using either leading-order standard perturbation theory (SPT) or the response
function (RF) approach to perturbation theory [35]. For the integrated 3PCFs that involve the
galaxy density field (which are all except the ζa±statistic studied previously in Refs. [28–30] that can
be computed accurately in the nonlinear regime using RF), we investigate the regime of validity of our
SPT models against measurements from realistic DES-like shear and galaxy mocks. Through Fisher
forecasts for a DES-like survey, we also investigate the constraining power of these statistics relative
to the conventional 3 ×2PCFs. We find that the addition of ζa±(the integrated 3PCF computed
from only the shear field) already allows for significant improvements of 20−40%on parameters
such as the cold-dark matter density Ωcdm, amplitude of primordial density fluctuations As, dark
energy equation of state parameter w0, reduced Hubble parameter hand even the linear galaxy bias
parameter b1. Adding the galaxy integrated 3PCFs and utilizing only the large scales where their
leading-order SPT models are valid allows for further improvements of ∼10%, which can increase to
∼20%when investigating extended cosmologies such as with a dynamical dark energy equation of
state parameter. Our results strongly motivate further work on these practical higher-order galaxy
and shear integrated 3-point statistics, which have the potential to improve cosmological, as well as
galaxy bias parameter constraints using real survey data.
The rest of this paper is as follows. In Secs. 2, 3 and 4 we present the theory expressions for
the 3×2PCFs, the position-dependent 1- and 2-point statistics, and the 6 integrated 3PCFs ζ. We
present the lensing and galaxy mocks we use in this work in Sec. 5, and our data vector measure-
ments and covariance estimation in Sec. 6. In Sec. 7 we present the comparison of our theoretical
models against simulations (Sec. 7.1), the validation of our models using Monte Carlo Markov Chain
(MCMC) analyses (Sec. 7.2), and Fisher forecasts (Sec. 7.3) to investigate the constraining power of
the integrated 3PCFs on cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. We summarise and conclude in
Sec. 8. Appendix A describes more details about the 2D projected shear and galaxy density fields. In
App. B we present expressions for the galaxy bias terms calculated in the halo occupation distribution
(HOD) formalism. Appendix C details the expressions of the galaxy-matter power- and bi-spectrum
models at leading order in SPT. In App. D we discuss details of the point mass contribution to the
correlations involving the tangential shear 2PCF.
2 2-point correlations of shear and galaxy fields
We study the correlations of two projected cosmic density fields, namely the weak lensing shear field
and the projected galaxy density contrast field.2We refer the reader to App. A for further details
about these two fields.

comoving horizon of the observable Universe and a(χ)is the scale factor of the Universe parametrized
in terms of χwhich we also utilise as a time coordinate instead of τ.H0is the Hubble parameter and
Ωmis the total matter density parameter today. The weak lensing shear γ(θ) =γ1(θ) +iγ2(θ)at a
given angular position θon the sky, which can be directly estimated using source galaxy shapes, is
a complex quantity where the shear components γ1andγ2are specified in a chosen Cartesian frame

second-order derivatives of the 2D lensing potential. In Fourier space, the shear γ(ℓ)is related to the

have ignored higher-order spatial derivatives of δ3D
m. The bias parameters bO(τ)are interpreted as the
response of the local number density of galaxies n3D
g(x, τ)to changes in the amplitude of the operators
O(x, τ); they absorb the complicated details of small-scale galaxy formation and evolution [40]. These
bias terms are often expressed using another notation b1≡bδ, b2≡2bδ2, bs2≡2bK2which we adopt
throughout. The terms inside the square brackets in Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7) denote the non-deterministic
(stochastic) part of the galaxy-matter relation which arise due to perturbations on small scales in the
underlying Ofields. Similar to the deterministic bias relation, the stochastic relation comes with its
own free parameters ϵOand an offset term ϵ.4We shall consider the bias and stochastic terms to be
time-independent inside a given galaxy redshift bin.
Using the (cross-) correlations of the cosmic shear and galaxy density contrast fields, we can
construct three 2PCFs :

κ(θ)andκ(ℓ)are the lensing convergence representations in real and Fourier space, respectively.
4We assume the stochastic terms to be Poisson random variables (see Sec. C). Exploring non-Poisson stochasticity
in the context of the integrated 3PCF is left to future work.

where we include the contribution from the so-called point-mass term, whose amplitude Mtis
a free parameter of the model. These terms are due to the fact that there are small nonlinear
scales, which are not well captured by perturbation theory ξPT
t, but which can still contribute to
the signal on large scales due to the nonlocal nature of the tangential shear signal (see App. D
or Ref. [44] for more details).
In the equations above, the superscripts i,jdenote tomographic bins of the background shear source
galaxies or the foreground lens galaxies. We consider only the so-called E-mode shear fields, for which
the imaginary parts of ξ±andξtvanish. In the last equalities in Eqs. (2.8), (2.9) and (2.10), we
have related the real space 2PCFs to the corresponding lensing/galaxy (cross-) power spectra through
inverse harmonic transforms (with Jnbeing the n-th order ordinary Bessel function of the first kind).
These spectra can in turn be expressed as line-of-sight projections of the 3D matter/galaxy (cross-)
power spectra using the Limber approximation [43, 45, 46] (see App. C):

Here, we have defined the convergence power spectrum in Fourier space as (2π)2Pij

We use HMCODE[47] to evaluate the nonlinear matter power spectrum P3D
mmthat enters the
calculation of ξ±. To evaluate P3D
ggandP3D
gm, which enter the calculation of ξgandξt, we will rely on
standard perturbation theory (SPT). Concretely, we work to leading order (tree-level) and evaluate
these 3D spectra as Pgg=b2
1Pmm+PϵϵandPgm=b1Pmm, where Pϵϵis the power spectrum of the
stochastic field ϵ(x)(see App. C). Note that owing to our inability to make predictions for galaxy
clustering observations on small, nonlinear scales, the galaxy-related statistics will be limited to larger
scales compared to ξ±.
5This 2PCF is also known as galaxy-galaxy lensing in literature, but we refrain from calling it so to avoid confusions
with the galaxy-galaxy clustering 2PCF.
6Effects such as lensing magnification can induce non-zero correlations between galaxies in different redshift bins
[43], but we defer the modelling of these effects to future work.
– 5 –We note already here that 3 ×2PCFs analyses are able to simultaneously constrain both the
b1and the Asparameters, where Asis the amplitude of the primordial scalar power spectrum; at
leading-order, ξ±∝As,ξt∝b1Asandξg∝b2
1As. We will see later that when we also consider the
integrated 3PCFs involving the galaxy density field, which display different scalings with b1andAs,
they will allow for further breaking of degeneracies and help put tighter constraints.
3 Position-dependent statistics of shear and galaxy fields
Having looked at the global 2PCFs, we turn our attention now to position-dependent quantities,
i.e. statistics of the fields within sub-patches of the survey (cf. Fig. 1).
3.1 Position-dependent 2-point correlation functions
First, we consider the case of the position-dependent 2PCFs which we define as 2PCFs measured inside
finite patches. Following the mathematical formalism of Ref. [28], we can write the angle-averaged
cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and the tangential shear position-dependent 2PCFs as

where the windowed rotated shear with respect to direction ϕαat location θinside a top-hat aperture
Wcentred at θCreads

and
δ2D
g(θ;θC) =δ2D
g(θ)W(θ−θC) (3.3)
is the windowed 2D galaxy density contrast at location θinside the same top-hat. The area normal-

2πZ
d2θW(θ−θC)W(θ+α−θC) =Zdℓ ℓ
2πW(ℓ)2J0(ℓα),(3.4)
where in the last equality we have used the Fourier space representation of the window function and
used the fact that we adopt only azimuthally symmetric apertures W. Specifically, for a top-hat filter
of angular radius θT, we have:
W(ℓ) =W(ℓ) = 2 πθ2
TJ1(ℓθT)
ℓθT. (3.5)
In Fourier space, these statistics can be expressed as (using Eq. (2.3) and following similar
derivation steps as in Refs. [28, 29])

Theϕℓ1andϕℓ2are polar angles of the wavevectors ℓ1,ℓ2, respectively. We also defined the shorthand

d2ℓ/(2π)2andℓ12...n≡ℓ1+ℓ2+...+ℓn. It can be shown that,
as expected, the ensemble averages of these position-dependent 2PCFs give the corresponding global
2PCFs.
3.2 Position-dependent 1-point statistics
In order to predict the integrated 3PCFs we also need position-dependent 1-point statistics . We
consider in particular the 1-point lensing aperture mass statistic and the 1-point average galaxy
density contrast.
The1-point lensing aperture mass in shear tomographic bin iis defined as [37]
Mi

d2θκi(θ)U(θ−θC) =Z
ℓκi(ℓ)U(ℓ)eiℓ·θC,(3.7)
where in the last equality we have used the Fourier space representation of the aperture mass. In
practice, this can be measured as a weighted mean of the tangential shear field γt≡ ℜ[γϕθ−θC]
inside a compensated filter Qcentred at location θC; the Fourier representation in terms of the
lensing convergence is useful from a theoretical modelling perspective. These compensated filters by
definition satisfy: Z
d2θU(θ−θC) =Z
d2θQ(θ−θC) = 0 , (3.8)
and hence an area normalisation term for this lensing aperture mass is irrelevant. We adopt the
following azimuthally-symmetric form for the UandQfilters [48]:

where the aperture scale of the compensated filter is denoted by θap. The Fourier space expression

The area normalisation term in this case is given by

which is simply the area enclosed by the top-hat filter.
4 Integrated 3-point correlations of shear and galaxy fields
We now have all of the ingredients needed to compute the integrated 3-point correlation functions
involving the cosmic shear and the galaxy density contrast fields. In essence, an integrated 3PCF is
simply the correlation between (i) a position dependent 1-point weighted mean within a patch of the
– 7 –survey with (ii) the position-dependent 2PCF measured at the same patch location (see Fig. 1). In
Refs. [28–30], the authors studied the case of the integrated shear 3PCF ζa±(α),7which corresponds
to the correlation between the 1-point lensing aperture mass Ma(θC)with the position-dependent
shear 2PCFs ξ±(α;θC). With the galaxy density contrast field, we can construct 5 additional such
cross-correlations, enabling a total of 6 integrated 3PCFs. The derivation steps are similar for all 6
statistics [28], which can be written as

7In Ref. [29] the authors denoted the integrated shear 3PCF as ζ±. To be consistent with the notations of the other
integrated 3PCFs involving the galaxy field that we introduce in this work, we denote the integrated shear 3PCF as
ζa±with the added subscript ‘ a’ to specify the involvement of the lensing aperture mass Main this statistic.
8In order to perform the numerical integrations in the predictions for Bwe use the Monte-Carlo Vegas algorithm [50].
Moreover, instead of using the inverse Hankel transform integrals directly to convert the B(ℓ)to real space integrated
3PCFs ζ(α)(and also the P(ℓ)to real space 2PCFs ξ(α)), we use expressions with summation over ℓas given in Ref. [51]
(see their Eq. (9)), which are exact in the curved-sky case and more accurate in that they take into account the finite
bin widths in which the correlation functions are measured in the data.

For the shear-only Ba±, Ref. [29] showed that the 3D nonlinear matter bispectrum B3D
mmmcan be
modelled accurately using the response approach to perturbation theory [35]. This is the calculation
we adopt here, which allows to evaluate ζa±down to nonlinear scales as a function of cosmological
and baryonic physics parameters. For the remainder of the integrated bispectra that involve the
galaxy density field, we model the corresponding bispectra at leading-order in perturbation theory;
we do not display all of these expressions here, but the interested reader can find them in App. C.
In particular, the various integrated 3PCFs display different scalings of the galaxy bias terms. Con-

cosmological parameters relative to the 3 global 2PCFs9discussed in Sec. 2 indicates that joint analy-
ses of these statistics can help to lift parameter degeneracies, leading to tighter parameter constraints
overall.
In Eqs. (4.1e) and (4.1f) for ζatandζgt, we note again the presence of point-mass contributions
with amplitude MatandMgt. These statistics involve the position-dependent tangential shear 2PCF,
which is why these parameters are introduced due to the nonlocality of the tangential shear signal.
The derivation of these point-mass term contributions is shown in App. D.
We also note that the correlations involving the 1-point average galaxy density Mg(θC)are sus-
ceptible to imaging systematics as they directly probe the number density of galaxies within apertures.
The presence of a position-dependent systematic effect affecting the observed foreground lens galaxy
number count at different locations θCon a survey footprint may therefore impact the measurements
of the ζg±, ζgt, ζggstatistics. We leave the investigation of the impact of such observational systematic
effects in the integrated 3PCFs to future work.
5 Simulations
In this section we present the simulated data we use in order to test our theoretical models of the
integrated 3PCFs discussed in the previous section. We use the publicly available cosmological sim-
ulation data from Ref. [52] (hereafter referred to as the T17 simulations).10In our work, we use the
full-sky lightcone halo catalogues and cosmic shear lensing maps of the simulation suite. The simula-
tion data products were obtained from a gravity-only N-body simulation in a ΛCDM cosmology with
the following parameters : Ωcdm= 0.233,Ωb= 0.046,Ωm= Ω cdm+ Ω b= 0.279,ΩΛ= 0.721, h=
0.7, σ8= 0.82 and ns= 0.97. The amplitude of the primordial scalar perturbations Ascorresponding
to the T17 value of σ8isAs= 2.197×10−9(we work with Asin our paper instead of σ8). Halos and
sub-halos in the simulation were identified using the six-dimensional phase-space friends-of-friends
algorithm ROCKSTAR [53]. These halo catalogues were combined in layers of shells to obtain full-sky
lightcone halo catalogues. The simulation boxes were also ray traced using the multiple-lens plane
ray-tracing algorithm GRAYTRIX [54, 55] to obtain weak lensing shear maps for several source redshifts
between z= 0.05andz= 5.3. We utilize 108 realizations of these data products, obtained from
multiple realizations of the T17 simulations.
5.1 Simulated weak lensing shear maps
To create a mock shear map from the T17 simulations we use a realistic source galaxy distribution.
In order to do that we combine the simulated T17 cosmic shear data products at individual source
9See Refs. [28, 29] for detailed discussions on the different dependence of ξ±andζa±on cosmological parameters.

same scheme as that used in Ref. [30], in particular we consider their second tomographic bin (cf. blue
dashed distribution in Fig. 2 of Ref. [30]; this corresponds to a combination of the third and fourth
DES Year 3 tomographic bins). The shear map is in Healpix [56] pixel format to which we add 5
galaxies per arcmin2to mimic the shape noise level expected for DES Year 6 (we refer the reader to
Ref. [28] for more details about the addition of shape noise).
5.2 Mock HOD galaxy catalogues
For the purpose of measuring the correlations on the galaxy density field we require mock galaxy
catalogues. Being a gravity-only N-body simulation, the T17 suite does not come with galaxy cata-
logues. We hence create our own full-sky galaxy mocks by populating the T17 halo catalogues using
an empirical Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) method [57] based on the widely used halo model
of large-scale structure (see Ref. [58] for a review). Briefly, an HOD model describes a probability
distribution P(Ng|Mh)for a halo mass Mhto host Nggalaxies. We follow Ref. [59] who used a
4-parameter HOD model to investigate the lens galaxy samples used in the DES data.
Concretely, the HOD model separates the contribution from central and satellite galaxies, and

Table 1 . HOD model parameters used in this work for populating mock lens galaxies in the T17 halo
catalogues. Halo masses are expressed in units of M⊙. Also listed are the galaxy number density and bias
parameter values obtained for each redshift bin.
Table 1 lists our HOD parameters for two lens tomographic redshift bins that we use in our
analyses. They are close to those in Ref. [59] for their first and third MagLim sample bins (see
Table D2 of Ref. [59]), and as a result, they result in similar galaxy number densities to the MagLim
sample. For our HOD parameters, using Eq. (B.2) in App. B, we have also computed the galaxy
bias parameters bO(z)averaged over the redshift distributions of the lens bins. We use the halo mass
function formula of Ref. [60] and (i) the halo b1fitting function from Ref. [61] to compute b1for the
galaxies, (ii) the halo b2(b1)fitting function from Ref. [62] to compute the galaxy b2, and (iii) the
co-evolution relation bs2=−4
7(b1−1)[39, 63] to obtain the galaxy bs2. We take these values to be
the fiducial bias parameters of our HOD samples; the bias values are listed in Tab. 1.
To create the actual mock galaxy catalogues from the T17 simulation, we first combine the halo
shells to obtain the halos in our two lens redshift intervals. Identifying Mhwith M200b(the mass
enclosed inside a radius where the mean density is 200 times the background matter density), we use
the HOD model described above to populate each halo in the catalogue with galaxies. For a given halo
we perform a Bernoulli draw with expectation given by Eq. (5.1) to get Ncenand a Poisson random
draw with expectation given by Eq. (5.2) to obtain Nsat. The central galaxies are placed at the halo
centres, whereas the satellite galaxies are placed randomly around the halo centre following a Navarro-
Frenk-White distribution [64] (this is as in Ref. [65]). We note further that we restrict ourselves to
using halos with masses M200b>1.1×1012M⊙/hfor BIN1 and M200b>5.1×1012M⊙/hfor BIN2
to remain largely unaffected by the mass resolution limit of the simulation in the respective redshift
ranges (see Tab. 1 of Ref. [52] for mass-cut details).
Inordertoobtainsmoothedlookingdistributionoflensgalaxiesinatomographicbinasexpected
from photometric galaxy imaging surveys like DES, we first populate HOD galaxies in halos within
and beyond the boundaries of the desired redshift range of the tomographic bin. To every true redshift
ztrueof these simulated HOD galaxies, we associate a mock ‘observed’ galaxy redshift zobs=ztrue+δz
where δzis drawn from a Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation σz= 0.02to mimic a
photometric uncertainty in the galaxy’s redshift [66, 67]. We then select those galaxies whose zobs
fall within the tomographic bin’s redshift range and use their corresponding ztruevalues to obtain
the distribution. The shapes of the mock galaxy distributions in the two redshift bins are shown in
Fig. 2. Finally, we project the galaxy catalogues to 2D grids in Healpix format with NSIDE = 2048
to obtain galaxy number counts maps, which we use to measure the auto- and cross-correlations of
the galaxy and cosmic shear fields.
6 Measurements and data covariance
We measure the galaxy and shear correlations on 6 non-overlapping 5000 deg2circular footprints
carved from each all-sky T17 galaxy/shear map; the footprint area is chosen to be representative of
a DES-like survey. Over the 108 T17 realizations, this results in a total of 648 DES-sized galaxy and
shear maps that we use to obtain our mean data vector and to estimate its covariance.
We follow the same measurement strategy (using the public code TreeCorr [42]) as Ref. [28]
for the shear-only ζa±statistic. The position-dependent 2PCFs11ˆξ(α;θC)(cf. Fig. 1) are measured
on the shear and galaxy density maps within top-hat windows Wwith radius θT= 130arcmin in
15 log-spaced angular bins within the range α∈[5,250]arcmin. The 1-point lensing aperture mass
ˆMa(θC)at location θCis estimated using shear measurements within a compensated window Qwith

– 11 –an aperture scale θap= 130arcmin (visualized as blue apertures in Fig. 1). The 1-point average
galaxy density contrast ˆMg(θC)on the other hand is measured by taking the mean of the pixel values
of the foreground lens galaxy density map within the same top-hat window Wwhere the ˆξ(α;θC)
are measured (visualized as red apertures in Fig. 1). In each 5000 deg2footprint, these apertures
are distributed to cover the whole area with only slight overlap between adjacent patches resulting in
order 1000 patches across the footprint. The integrated 3PCFs are then estimated as
ˆζxy(α) =1
NpNpX
i=1ˆMx(θC,i)ˆξy(α,θC,i), (6.1)
where x∈ {a, g},y∈ {± , t, g}and the sum runs over the Nppatches centered at θC,i. On the other
hand, the global 2PCFs ˆξ(α)in a given footprint are estimated with TreeCorr by using all the pixel
values for shear or the galaxy density contrast within the entire footprint.
The full mean data vector is then obtained as the average over the estimates from the 648 mock
footprints. For the case of a single lens and single source redshift bin, the data vector consists of the
following correlations:
d≡ {ξ+, ξ−, ζa+, ζa−|{z }
shear-only, ξg, ζgg|{z}
galaxy-only, ξt, ζat, ζag, ζg+, ζg−, ζgt| {z }
galaxy-shear cross-correlations| {z }
galaxy correlations}. (6.2)
To aid in our discussions below, we organize the data vector into different types of contributions. The
first 4 components are the cosmic shear-only ξ±andζa±correlations; the 5th and 6th components are
thegalaxy-only correlations ξg,ζgg; the remaining components correspond to the galaxy-shear cross-
correlations . We denote the galaxy-only and the galaxy-shear cross-correlations together as galaxy
correlations indicating that they involve the galaxy field. Accounting for our other lens redshift bin
results in additional galaxy correlation terms.
The data covariance matrix is estimated from the mocks as
ˆC=1
Ns−1NsX
i=1(ˆdi−ˆd)(ˆdi−ˆd)T, (6.3)
where Ns= 648is the number of mock footprints, ˆdiis the data vector measured in the i-th footprint,
andˆdthe sample mean over the Nsrealizations. To get an unbiased estimate of the inverse covariance
matrix we apply the correction [68]
C−1=Ns−Nd−2
Ns−1ˆC−1, (6.4)
where Ndis the length of the data vector. For our two lens bins and single source bin we have 20
components in d, each with 15 data points making a total of 300 data points before the application
of any scale cuts. All of the components of our data vector are shown by the black points with error
bars in Fig. 3; the error bars shown are the square root of the diagonal of the covariance matrix.
7 Results
In this section we present our main numerical results for the modelling and cosmological constraining
power of the integrated 3PCFs. First, we discuss the regime of validity of our perturbation theory
model for the galaxy correlations, i.e. ξt, ξg, ζat, ζag, ζg±, ζgt. Then, we demonstrate the ability of our
galaxy correlation models to recover unbiased constraints on As, as well as on the bias parameters b1
andb2of the mock galaxy samples through an MCMC likelihood analysis. Finally, we present Fisher
forecast results where we investigate the constraining power of a joint 3 ×2PCF and integrated 3PCF
analysis using all the correlations i.e., both cosmic shear-only ( ξ±,ζa±) as well as galaxy correlations.

cosmological parameters of the simulations and the fiducial galaxy bias parameter values evaluated using the
HOD approach for the lens galaxy sample. The purple dashed vertical lines show our conservative scale cuts
to remove scales where our tree-level perturbation theory model breaks down; scales below these cuts are not
included in the MCMC and Fisher forecast analyses. The blue dashed curves show the theory predictions
computed at the maximum posterior of the MCMC analysis performed in Section 7.2. Fourth and fifth
rows: Same as the second and third rows but for Lens BIN2 instead of BIN1.
7.1 Comparison of theoretical models to measurements from simulations
Figure 3 compares the components of our data vector in Eq. (6.2) (black dots) with our theory model
predictions from Secs. 2 and 4 evaluated at the fiducial cosmology and bias parameters (red curves).
The first row shows the cosmic shear-only correlations, namely the global shear 2PCFs ξ±and
the integrated shear-only 3PCFs ζa±; recall these are evaluated using the nonlinear matter power
spectrum from the HMCODEand the response approach bispectrum model from Ref. [29], respectively.
– 13 –As previously discussed in Ref. [29], the theoretical models for these shear-only correlations are in
excellent agreement with the simulation measurements on all angular scales probed. Further, our
model allows to readily incorporate the impact of baryonic feedback on small scales. We follow the
strategy of Ref. [29] (see their Sec. 4.2) to determine scale cuts to remove scales that are expected to
be severely affected by baryonic physics. In Fig. 3, these are shown by the purple dashed vertical lines
in the first row of panels; concretely, the data to the right of these lines are deemed to be unaffected
by baryonic feedback.
The second and third row of panels in Fig. 3 show the galaxy correlations for Lens BIN1, i.e. the
ξt, ξg2PCFs and the ζat, ζag, ζg±, ζgt, ζggintegrated 3PCFs. The first and second panels in the second
row show ξt(α)andξg(α). For ξt, our tree-level perturbation theory model is in good agreement with
the simulation results on only large angular scales α, whereas for ξg, the tree-level model displays a
good fit down to comparatively smaller angular scales. This is as expected since at a given α,ξtis
more sensitive to larger multipoles ℓ(smaller nonlinear scales) compared to ξg; this is because the
former’s J2Bessel function in the Fourier- to real-space conversion (cf. Eqs. (2.10), (2.9)) weights the
nonlinear scales more than the J0function of the latter. Thus, ξtgets more contributions from scales
where our perturbation theory model breaks down, hence the poorer agreement between theory and
simulations in the figure.
The third and fourth panels in the second row show the integrated 3PCFs ζat(α)andζag(α),
whereas the panels in the third row are for the integrated 3PCFs ζg+, ζg−, ζgt, ζgg. The galaxy corre-
lations ζshow similar trends as ξt,ξg: the models agree with the simulations on large angular scales,
but become discrepant on smaller scales where the tree-level models break down (this can be similarly
understood in terms of the Jnweightings of each statistic). We note that in our fiducial predictions
forξt, ζat, ζgtwe set the corresponding point-mass terms Mto zero. The values of these parameters
cannot be predicted from first principles (they capture a complicated interplay of higher-order galaxy
bias, stochastic terms and nonlinear matter fluctuations), and so in our MCMC validation analysis
below we will treat them as free parameters.
We conservatively estimate the regime of validity of our perturbation theory models for the
galaxy correlations as follows. We compute the theoretical predictions for two scenarios: (i) using the
fiducial tree-level model dtreeand (ii) another model dkNLwhere we artificially set all Fourier modes k
larger than the non-linear scale kNLto zero.12Using these predictions, we progressively discard small
angular scales from our data vector until χ2≡(dtree−dkNL)TC−1(dtree−dkNL)<0.3is satisfied.
This roughly identifies a minimum scale αminbelow which our perturbation theory model begins to
fail significantly; the resulting scale cuts are marked by the purple dashed vertical lines in the galaxy
correlations panels.13We note that our criteria for determining these scale cuts are conservative.
In particular, allowing the point-mass terms to vary, which we currently set to zero, could allow for
greater reach down to smaller angular scales in ξt,ζat, and ζgt. This could in turn enable the use of
higher signal-to-noise data points. As our primary aim is to explore the first-order information gain
that the galaxy correlations can already bring from scales where leading-order PT models are valid,
we choose to adopt these conservative scale cuts and defer the investigation of more accurate models
on smaller angular scales to future works.
Finally, similar considerations hold for the fourth and fifth rows of panels in Fig. 3, which show
the same as the second and third rows, but for the Lens BIN2. We note only that the error bars in
some of the panels are larger than those for BIN1, which is as expected by the fact that the number
density of galaxies in BIN2 is approximately 3times smaller than that of BIN 1 (cf. Tab. 1).
7.2 MCMC validation of the galaxy correlations modelling
Using the measured galaxy correlations with the scale cuts, we now test whether our tree-level pertur-
bation theory models can correctly recover the fiducial parameters in an MCMC constraint analysis;
we do not consider the shear-only correlations in this section to focus on the galaxy correlations mod-
12The nonlinear scale is defined implicitly as k3
NLP3D
lin(kNL, z)/(2π)3= 1.
13Note these scale cuts are not the same as those applied on the shear-only statistics, which ensure instead that the
scales are not affected by baryonic feedback effects. We assume also that perturbation theory breaks down on scales
larger than the scales where baryonic effects are important, as is reasonable.

2obtained from the galaxy 2PCFs ξt, ξg(blue dashed) and considering also the galaxy
integrated 3PCFs, ξt, ξg, ζat, ζag, ζg±, ζgt, ζgg(red solid). We consider the average T17 measurements as the
data vector with the scale cuts discussed in Sec. 7.1. The fiducial values of the parameters are marked by the
black dashed lines. Note that at tree-level, the galaxy 2PCFs cannot constrain the second-order b2parameters.
The point-mass terms associated with tangential shear correlations are marginalized over; see Fig. 8 in App. D
for their constraints. All other parameters are fixed to the fiducial values of the simulation and the tidal bias
terms are varied according to the co-evolution bs2(b1)relation.
elling. We investigate in particular the constraints on the galaxy bias parameters b1andb2, as well
as the cosmological parameter As.14We assume a Gaussian likelihood function and wide uniform
priors for the parameters varied: in addition to Asand the b1,b2of the two samples, we also vary the
point-mass Mamplitude parameters that contribute to the ξt, ζat, ζgtstatistics. We do not sample
bs2but let it vary according to the co-evolution relation for bs2(b1). We use the publicly available
affine sampler emcee[69] to perform the MCMC analysis. The results are shown in the contour plot
in Fig. 4. The figure is for the result marginalized over the point-mass terms, but see Fig. 8 in App. D
for the constraints on all varied parameters.
The figure shows that our tree-level models for ξt,ξg, which are only sensitive to Asandb1,
correctly recover the fiducial values of the parameters within the 68% credible intervals (blue dashed
contours). When considering the galaxy integrated 3PCFs (red contours), the constraints remain
unbiased, but they become visibly tighter. This shows that our conservative scale cuts are adequate
to return unbiased results, while still letting our tree-level models explore the non-Gaussian informa-
tion in the galaxy correlations to improve the parameter constraints. Relative to the galaxy 2PCFs
constraints (blue), the addition of the galaxy integrated 3PCFs (red) improves the constraints on
14We take Asas the only cosmological parameter in the MCMC results as predictions for it are rapid to obtain.
The extension to other cosmological parameters would require the construction of dedicated emulators for fast theory
predictions (e.g. see Ref. [30] for an emulator for ζa±), which is beyond the scope of this work.

1by approximately 30%,20%,25%, respectively. These improvements are asso-
ciated to the breaking of degeneracies between Asandb1in the galaxy 2PCFs by the galaxy integrated
3PCFs. The galaxy integrated 3PCFs can also constrain the b2parameter, which is not possible with
ξt,ξgat tree-level.
The predictions of the tree-level models using the best-fitting parameters from this MCMC
analysis are shown by the blue dashed curves in Fig. 3. As expected, they agree with the predictions
for the fiducial parameters (red curves) on scales larger than our assumed scale cuts.
7.3 Fisher forecasts for a DES-Y3-like survey
We now investigate in the context of Fisher matrix forecasts the ability of combined 2PCFs and
integrated 3PCFs to constrain cosmological parameters; from hereon we consider also the cosmic
shear-only 2PCFs ξ±and integrated 3PCFs ζa±. The Fisher information matrix Ffor a model vector
Mdepending on parameters π, assuming a constant data-covariance C, is given by [70]
Fij=∂M(π)
∂πiT
C−1∂M(π)
∂πj
, (7.1)
where Fijis an element of the matrix Fassociated with the parameters πiandπj, and C−1is the
inverse data covariance matrix in Eq. (6.4). The partial derivative of the model vector with respect
to the parameter πican be computed using a 2-point central difference:
∂M(π)
∂πi=M(πi+δi)−M(πi−δi)
2δi, (7.2)
where δiis a small change in the parameter πiaround its fiducial value, and M(πi±δi)is the model
vector computed at the changed parameter πi±δiwith all the other parameters fixed. We consider the
followingcosmologicalandbaryonicfeedbackparameters πcosmo ={Ωcdm,ln(1010As), w0, wa, h, c min},
where w0, waare the dynamical dark energy equation of state parameters (in the CPL parametrization
w(z) =w0+waz/(1 +z)[71]) and cminis a baryonic feedback parameter of the HMCODE[47] nonlinear
matter power spectrum which enters in our modelling of the cosmic shear-only statistics ξ±andζa±.
The fiducial values are π0={0.233,3.089,−1,0.0,0.7,3.13}; the cosmological parameters are the
same as the T17 simulations, and the baryonic parameter is the gravity-only value as determined by
Ref. [47]. When varying the Ωcdmparameter we keep the baryon density Ωbfixed, but adjust the
dark energy density to keep the universe spatially flat. In addition, we also vary the galaxy bias b1, b2
and point-mass Mparameters for both lens samples. The fiducial values of the galaxy bias terms are
given in Tab. 1; the point-mass term fiducial values are assumed to be zero in our analysis. When
varying b1we evaluate the tidal bias terms bs2according to the co-evolution relation bs2(b1).
The parameter covariance matrix Cπis given by the inverse of the Fisher matrix
Cπ=F−1, (7.3)
which we use to forecast constraints on the model parameters. In our results below, we report
the Fisher constraints on the cosmological parameters, baryonic feedback parameter and linear bias
parameter b1, marginalizing over the second-order bias b2and point-mass terms. We present results
for three different combinations of 2- and 3-point statistics: (i) a 3 ×2PCF-only analysis, labelled
as{ξ±, ξt, ξg}and shown in blue colour; (ii) the same, but adding the shear-only integrated 3PCF,
labelled as {ξ±, ξt, ξg, ζa±}and shown in green; and (iii) using all of the statistics discussed in this
paper combined, labelled as all correlations and shown in red. For each of these, we discuss three
analysis setup cases:
•Case A: constraints on the parameters {Ωcdm,ln(1010As), w0, h, bBIN1
1, bBIN2
1}, assuming scale
cuts on all statistics (cf. vertical lines in Fig. 3). Recall that the scale cuts on the cosmic
shear-only statistics ξ±, ζa±are the ones deemed as baryon-free, and so we keep cminfixed
to the fiducial value (we also fix wa). The 1 σmarginalized Fisher constraints are shown in
Fig. 5. Relative to the 3 ×2PCF constraints (blue), the addition of the shear-only integrated

(conservative scale cuts are still imposed on the galaxy correlations) and cminis a free parameter.
3PCF ζa±(green) improves the constraints on {Ωcdm,ln(1010As), w0, h}by{27,48,47,27}%,

to further {9,10,10,9}%improvements (red vs. green). The constraints on the bias parameters
{bBIN1

and{3,7}%from the green to the red constraints.
•Case Bis the same as case A, but with watreated as a free parameter; the constraints are
shown in Fig. 6. Relative to the 3 ×2PCFs, ζa±leads to improvements of {13,53,22,29,11}%on
{Ωcdm,ln(1010As), w0, wa, h}(green vs. blue). The addition of all other galaxy integrated 3PCF
correlations leads to further improvements of {24,15,27,27,23}%. The same improvements for
{bBIN1
1, bBIN2
1}are{28,42}%(green vs. blue) and {6,14}%(red vs. green).
•Case Cis the same as case A, but without any scale cuts on the shear-only statistics ξ±, ζa±
– 17 –(we still apply the scale cuts on the galaxy correlations). Hence, in this case we also vary
the baryonic feedback parameter cmin. We fix waagain to its fiducial value. The results are
shown in Fig. 7. The ζa±statistic improves the constraints on {Ωcdm,ln(1010As), w0, h, c min}by
{34,47,47,34,27}%, relative to 3 ×2PCFs (green vs. blue). The rest of the galaxy correlations
can further improve these by {8,10,10,9,2}%(red vs. green). The same improvements for
{bBIN1
1, bBIN2
1}are{25,48}%(green vs. blue) and {3,6}%(red vs. green).
The main takeaway from Figs. 5, 6, 7 is that the bulk of the improvements from adding inte-
grated 3PCF information to 3 ×2PCF-only analyses comes from the addition of the cosmic shear-only
integrated 3PCF ζa±(20−40%; green bars), with the remainder of the integrated 3PCFs involving
the galaxy density field adding smaller, but still significant improvements of approximately 10% (red
bars). The smaller improvements by these galaxy correlations must be interpreted however in light of
the conservative range of scales we assumed for them; higher-order perturbation theory calculations
of the galaxy-matter bispectrum valid on smaller scales may result in further information gains in
cosmological parameter constraints even when marginalizing over larger number of bias parameters
(see Ref. [72]). In addition, even for our conservative scale cuts, these galaxy correlations show the
potential to already lead to improvements of up to 20%in parameter constraints when wais included
as a free parameter. Besides cosmology, another advantage of the galaxy integrated 3PCFs is that
they can tighten constraints not only on linear bias, but also higher-order galaxy bias parameters.
We note further that the improvements reported here are also tied to other analysis setup choices
such as the parameter space, number of lens and source tomographic bins and galaxy number density.
For example, the precise numbers may change when increasing the number of tomographic bins in
the analysis. In any case, we expect that the addition of the integrated 3PCFs will always help to lift
parameter degeneracies present at the 2PCF level and lead generically to improved constraints.
8 Summary and Conclusion
The integrated 3-point function is a practical statistic that measures the correlation between the
local 2-point correlation function and 1-point averages in patches of the survey, and which probes
the squeezed-limit of the full 3-point function. In Refs. [28–30] this formalism has been developed
for the case of the cosmic shear field, where the statistic is known as the integrated shear 3-point
correlation function ζa±. In this paper, we have extended the formalism to include the foreground
galaxy distribution and its cross-correlations with the shear field, which results in 5 new integrated
3PCFs, {ζat, ζag, ζg±, ζgt, ζgg}. In total, these 6 statistics describe the correlation between (i) three
position-dependent 2PCFs, namely cosmic shear 2PCF ξ±, tangential shear 2PCF ξtand galaxy
clustering 2PCF ξg, and (ii) two average 1-point statistics, namely the lensing aperture mass Ma
and the average foreground galaxy density Mg(see Fig. 1 for an illustration). This forms a set of
higher-order galaxy and shear statistics that can be readily measured from survey data, and thus be
used to improve cosmological parameter constraints relative to standard analyses based on 2PCFs
alone.
The main objectives of our work were to:
1. Introduce the integrated 3PCFs involving the galaxy and cosmic shear fields, and put forward
theory model predictions to evaluate them (Sec. 4 and App. C). For the shear-only ζa±statistic
we use the response approach to perturbation theory which is accurate in the nonlinear regime.
For all other statistics involving the galaxy density field we use tree-level perturbation theory.
2. Identify the regime of validity of the theory predictions against measurements from realistic
mock galaxy and lensing simulated data (see Secs. 5, 6 and 7.2). We considered a DES Y3-like
setup with two foreground lens galaxy bins and a single source lensing bin.
3. Investigate the improvement in cosmological, baryonic and galaxy bias parameter constraints
from adding the integrated 3PCFs to standard analyses based on global 3 ×2PCFs.
Our main results can be summarized as follows:
– 18 –•Concerning the integrated 3PCFs involving the galaxy density field that are new to this work,
we find that even when restricting to large angular scales (with conservative scale cuts) where
our tree-level perturbation theory models are valid (cf. Fig. 3), these higher-order statistics
can still lead to improvements in parameter constraints. In an MCMC constraint analysis on
the cosmological parameter Asand the galaxy bias parameters b1andb2, we found that the
corresponding fiducial parameter values can be recovered within 68%credible intervals and the
addition of the integrated 3PCFs ζat, ζag, ζg±, ζgt, ζgg, could lead to 20−30%improvements over
the constraints from the galaxy 2PCFs ξt, ξg.
•Using Fisher matrix forecasts for a DES-Y3-like survey, we find that the addition of the shear-
only integrated 3PCF ζa±can lead to 20−40%improvements on the constraints of parame-
ters like Ωcdm,ln(1010As), w0, h, b 1, relative to the standard analysis with the 3 ×2PCFs alone
(cf. green vs. blue in Figs. 5 and 7).
•The addition of the remainder integrated 3PCFs involving the galaxy density field, even when
restricted to conservatively large scales, can further improve the constraints by ∼10%(cf. red
vs. green in Figs. 5 and 7). These improvements depend however on the specific analysis setup:
for example, in constraints where the dynamical dark energy parameter wais free, these im-
provements can become ∼15−25%(cf. Fig. 6).
These results are encouraging and motivate further developments on the theory modelling front.

uncertainty and shear calibration bias. In particular, it would be interesting to generalize the work of
Ref. [30] on the integrated shear 3PCF, who investigated the optimal size of apertures for measuring
ζa±and developed an end-to-end ζa±MCMC analysis pipeline, to the case of the integrated 3PCFs
involving the galaxy density field. Jointly analysing the 3 ×2PCFs and the integrated 3PCFs in cases
beyond the standard cosmological parameters such as in searches for primordial non-Gaussianity and
massive neutrinos using galaxy imaging and CMB lensing surveys would also be interesting avenues
to explore in future works.
Overall, our results indicate that there is important cosmological information in integrated 3-
point correlation functions involving the galaxy field and its cross-correlations with cosmic shear.
Crucially, these statistics can be straightforwardly measured using existing and well-tested estimators
for 1- and 2-point statistics, enabling the exploration of 3-point function information in current galaxy
imaging surveys such as DES, and in the future using Euclid and Vera Rubin LSST data.

– 19 –A Projected galaxy and weak lensing fields
In this appendix we outline the background behind the cosmic shear and the projected galaxy density
contrast fields we consider in this work.
A.1 Tangential and cross components of the shear field
The complex weak lensing shear γ(θ) =γ1(θ) +iγ2(θ)has components γ1andγ2specified in a given
Cartesian frame. However, one is free to rotate the coordinates by any arbitrary angle β. With respect
to this reference rotation angle β, one defines the rotated shear
γβ(θ)≡ −e−2iβγ(θ) =−e−2iβ
γ1(θ) +iγ2(θ)
, (A.1)
and correspondingly the tangential (t) and cross(×) components of the shear at position θw.r.t. the
reference rotation angle βas
γβ(θ)≡γt(θ, β) +iγ×(θ, β) =−e−2iβ
γ1(θ) +iγ2(θ)
. (A.2)
In particular, given a pair of points θandϑon the sky separated by α≡ϑ−θ, one can write the
tangential and cross components of the shear along β=ϕα(where ϕαis polar angle of α).
A.2 Projected galaxy number density contrast field
The projected number of galaxies N(θ)at position θcan be written as a line-of-sight projection of
the three-dimensional galaxy number density n3D

B HOD expressions for galaxy bias
The halo model and halo occupation distribution (HOD) approach offer a useful framework to make
predictions for the galaxy bias parameters defined in Eq. (2.7). The halo model assumes that galaxies
reside inside dark matter halos with some mass. In this HOD approach the effective global number
density of galaxies hosted within halos of mass Mh∈[Mh,min , Mh,max ]is given by

g(τ) =ZMh,max

where d¯n3D

finitesimal mass bin dMharound halos of mass Mh) and ¯Ng(Mh, τ)is the expected number of galaxies
residing inside dark matter halos of mass Mhat time τ. The galaxy bias parameters bOare in turn
expressed as [80]

theresponse function of¯Ngfor large-scale perturbations O. This response function describes the
modulation of ¯Ngby the Operturbations, in the same way that the bias parameters bO,hdescribe the
modulation of the halo mass function. In our HOD catalogues, we have assumed ¯Ngto be the same
everywhere inside the simulation box irrespective of the local density and tidal field values, which
corresponds to assuming RO,¯Ng= 0. In order to get an effective bias bi

We note that to evaluate B3D

orderingofwavevectors kitotherespectivegalaxydensity ‘g’partsofthecorrelations. Forexamplein
B3D
gmm(k1,k2,k3), thek1mode is associated to δg, whereas in B3D
mgm(k1,k2,k3)it is instead the mode
k2. One thus needs to alter the wavevector arguments in Eq. (C.6b) accordingly when calculating
B3D
mgm. Similar considerations hold when there are two instances of δg, e.g. in B3D
ggm(k1,k2,k3)and

The tangential shear signal is effectively a measure of the excess surface mass density ∆Σgm, which
is defined as

This equation shows that the result at a given Rgets contributions from ξgmon all distance scales
below it through the integralRR

circumvent the problem and be able to make predictions for the tangential shear signal we write the
galaxy-matter correlation function as
ξgm(r) =ξPT
gm(r) +ξres
gm(r), (D.6)
where ξres
gm(r)is a residual term that is only nonzero for r < r min, with rmindenoting the scale below
which perturbation theory breaks down. This way Eq. (D.5) can be written as
∆Σgm(R > R min) = ∆ΣPT
gm(R > R min) + ∆Σres

whichmatchesEq.(2.10)inthemainbodyofthepaper. WerefertheinterestedreadertoRefs.[44,82–
85] for more details about point-mass term contributions to the tangential shear 2PCF.
Similar point mass terms contribute to the integrated 3PCFs as well. Concretely, we can write
theposition-dependent tangential shear 2PCF with a position-dependent point-mass term Mt(θC)as
ξt(α;θC) =ξPT
t(α;θC) +Mt(θC)
α2. (D.16)
The correlation of this statistic with the lensing aperture mass Ma(θC)yields Eq. (4.1e) for ζat(α),
ζat(α)≡ ⟨Ma(θC)ξt(α;θC)⟩=⟨Ma(θC)ξPT
t(α;θC)⟩+⟨Ma(θC)Mt(θC)⟩

=ζPT
at(α) +Mat
α2,(D.17)
where the last equality defines the point-mass term forζat,Mat. Similarly, the correlation with the
mean number of galaxies within apertures yields Eq. (4.1f) for ζgt(α),
ζgt(α)≡ ⟨Mg(θC)ξt(α;θC)⟩=⟨Mg(θC)ξPT
t(α;θC)⟩+⟨Mg(θC)Mt(θC)⟩

withMgta new point-mass term. Again, these new point-mass terms cannot be evaluated with
perturbation theory, and so we treat them as free model parameters.
Figure 8 shows the constraints from an MCMC analysis with the galaxy 2PCFs (blue) and their
combination with the galaxy integrated 3PCFs (red); this is the same as Fig. 4 in the main body
of the paper in Sec. 7.2, except it also shows the constraints on the point-mass terms. Note each of
the two lens galaxy samples has their associated point-mass terms. In the figure, it is interesting to
note that the addition of the integrated 3PCFs leads to tighter constraints also on the Mtpoint-mass
terms that contribute to ξt. We leave a more in depth study of the constraints on point-mass terms,
including eventual insights on the density profile of the lens galaxies, to future work.
