Abstract. We addressthe general problemofestimating the probabilit y thata realsymmetrictensor
is close to rank–one tensors. Using Weyl’s tube formula, we t urn this question into a diﬀerential
geometric one involving the study of metric invariants of th e real Veronese variety. More precisely,
we give an explicit formula for its reach and curvature coeﬃc ients with respect to the Bombieri–Weyl
metric. These results are obtained using techniques from Ra ndom Matrix theory and an explicit
description of the second fundamental form of the Veronese v ariety in terms of GOE matrices. Our
ﬁndings give a complete solution to the original problem. In the case of rational normal curves it
leads to a simple formula describing explicitly exponentia l decay with respect to the degree of the
tensor.
1.Introduction
1.1.What is the probability that a random symmetric tensor is clo se to rank-one? Over
the last decades, symmetric tensors have been proven to be a ver y ﬂexible and valuable tool in many
diﬀerent contexts. In particular, rank–oneapproximationand te nsor decomposition found applications
in machine learning ([ AGH+14]), signal processing and image analysis ([ SDLF+17], [Sak16, Ch.3, 4]),
chemistry ([ SBG04]), statistics ([ McC87]), psychology and medical diagnostics ([ Kro08,ALLF07]),
phylogenetics ([ Sak16, Ch.5], [ Lan12]), and quantum computing ([ GFE09]), to name a few. Motivated
by this, in this paper we address the following question:
“What is the probability for a real symmetric tensor to be “cl ose” to rank–one?”
To make this question more precise, we need to introduce a natural notion of distance and a natural
probabilitymeasureonthespace Sd(n)ofrealsymmetrictensorson Rnoforderd. Recallﬁrstthatthis
is the subspace of ( Rn)⊗dconsisting of elements which are invariant under the action of the sy mmetric
group under permutation of the factors. The set Sd
1(n) of symmetric, rank–one tensors consists of the
set of elements T∈ Sd(n) of the form T=±v⊗···⊗vfor somev∈Rn.
The space of all tensors is endowed with the Frobenius scalar product , denoted by /a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{t·,·/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htFand deﬁned
as follows. Letting {e1,...,en}be the standard basis of Rn, then a basis for the space of tensors is
given by {ei1⊗···⊗eid|1≤i1,...,id≤n}and the Frobenius scalar product is obtained by declaring
this basis to be orthonormal. We still denote by /a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{t·,·/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htFthe restriction of the Frobenius scalar product
to the space of symmetric tensors and we use the notation /⌊a∇d⌊l·/⌊a∇d⌊lFfor the associated norm and dist F(·,·)
for the induced distance function.
The choice of a scalar product on a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space naturally leads to the deﬁnition
of a Gaussian measure on it (this comes for free without introducing further structure). In the case
of our interest, the space of symmetric tensors with the Frobeniu s scalar product can be turned into
aGaussian probability space by deﬁning for every Borel set U⊆ Sd(n)

of tensors and the resulting Gaussian probability distribution inherit s this invariance (see Section 2.1).

With this notation, the above question can be phrased more precise ly as follows: we are required
to compute, for a given δ>0, the quantity:
(2) P/braceleftbigg
T∈ Sd(n)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingledistF(T,Sd
1(n))≤δ/⌊a∇d⌊lT/⌊a∇d⌊lF/bracerightbigg
.
Notice that we have turned the question into a conic problem that ta kes into account also the norm
of the tensor, as it is common procedure in numerical algebraic geom etry [BC13].
Before proceeding, we discuss two examples of applications of the r esults of the current paper, more
precisely of Theorem E, which gives a closed formula for the probability in ( 2).
Example 1 (Real symmetric matrices) .Whend= 2 the space S2(n) can be naturally identiﬁed with
the space of n×nreal symmetric matrices and the Frobenius scalar product is given b y
/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tA,B/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htF= tr(AB).
In this case, by the Spectral Theorem, the set S2
1(n) of rank–one tensors coincides with the set of
matrices of the form A=±vvt, for somev∈Rn. The space of symmetric matrices together with the
Gaussian distribution ( 1) is called by probabilists the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble , and denoted by
GOE(n) (see Section 2.1). Ordering the singular values of Qin increasing order, σ1(Q)≤ ··· ≤σn(Q),
by the Eckart–Young Theorem, the distance in the Frobenius norm betweenQandS2
1(n) is given by
distF(Q,S2
1(n)) =/parenleftBiggn−1/summationdisplay
k=1σk(Q)2/parenrightBigg1

.
In this case, using the fact that /⌊a∇d⌊lQ/⌊a∇d⌊l2
F=σ1(Q)2+···+σn(Q)2, the probability in ( 2) equals
(3) P/braceleftbigg
(1−δ2)/⌊a∇d⌊lQ/⌊a∇d⌊l2
F≤σn(Q)2/bracerightbigg
,
therefore our question becomes of interest from the point of view of Random Matrix Theory. In this
case, we can apply Theorem Eand obtain a closed formula for the probability in ( 3), forδ≤1/√
2.
For instance:
P/braceleftbigg
Q∈ S2(3)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(1−δ2)/⌊a∇d⌊lQ/⌊a∇d⌊l2

In the context of Random Matrix Theory, which is concerned with th e study of the distribution of
the eigenvalues of random symmetric matrices, expressions like ( 4) are especially interesting. In fact,
most of the theory is focused on asymptotic results with the size of the matrices that goes to inﬁnity
(see, for instance, [ AGZ10, Chapter 3]) and very little is known on the distribution of the eigenva lues
of random matrices of ﬁxed (small) size.
Example 2 (Geometric measure of entanglement) .Quantum entanglement is one of the main topics
of research in quantum information theory, where it provides an imp ortant resource for quantum
computing. Recall that a d-partite pure (symmetric) state of a quantum system can be rega rded as a
normalized(symmetric) tensor in the tensorproduct of dHilbert spaces H=⊗d
k=1Hk. A state |φ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht ∈ H
is called separable if it is a product state |φ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht=⊗d
k=1|φ(k)/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htwith/⌊a∇d⌊l|φ(k)/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht/⌊a∇d⌊lHk= 1 fork= 1,...,d; it is
calledentangled if it is not separable. In the language of tensors, separable pure st ates correspond to
rank-one tensors, while entangled states to tensors of higher ra nk.
A way to quantify the entaglement of a pure state, i.e. to measure h ow distant that state is from being
separable, is the geometric measure of entanglement , ﬁrst introduced in [ Shi95] (see also [ HKW+09]
for symmetric states). For a pure symmetric state |ψ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htthis is deﬁned as [ HQZ16]
EG(|ψ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht) := 1− max
Φ=|φ/ang⌊ra⌋ketright⊗d∈H,/⌊ard⌊l|φ/ang⌊ra⌋ketright/⌊ard⌊l=1|/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tψ|Φ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht|. (6)
When the space is H= (Rn)⊗dendowed with the Euclidean norm, pure symmetric states are repre -
sented by a tensor T∈Sd(n) with Frobenius norm 1 and ( 6) becomes
EG(T) = 1−max
x∈Sn−1|/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tT,x⊗d/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htF|. (7)WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT A RANDOM SYMMETRIC TENSOR IS CLO SE TO RANK-ONE? 3
In the tensor community, given T∈Sd(n) andx∈Sn−1the quantity
Txd:=/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tT,x⊗d/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htF
isknownasthe Generalized Rayleigh Quotient (GQR) [ZG01]. Theproblemofmaximizingtheabsolute
value of the GRQ over Sn−1for a tensor Tis equivalent to ﬁnding the best rank-one approximation
ofT. Indeed, given x∗∈Sn−1such that
|Txd
∗|= max
x∈Sn−1|Txd|, (8)
we have that ( Txd

see [QL17, Theorem 2.19]. When Trepresentsa pure symmetric state as above, by deﬁnition /⌊a∇d⌊lT/⌊a∇d⌊lF= 1
and (7) becomes
EG(T) = 1−/radicalBig
1−dist2
F(T,Sd

A bound on the distance of Tfrom rank-one symmetric tensors implies a bound on the geometric
measure of entanglement of the pure symmetric state represent ed byT. In particular, we see that
P/braceleftbigg
T∈ Sd(n),/⌊a∇d⌊lT/⌊a∇d⌊lF= 1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingledistF(T,Sd

EG(T)≤1−/radicalbig

,
where the left-hand side is equivalent to ( 2).
An alternative formulation of the geometric measure of entangleme nt sometimes used in quantum
computing [ GFE09] is given as
˜EG(|ψ/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht) :=−log2/parenleftbigg

.
With the same reasoning as before we obtain
P/braceleftbigg
T∈ Sd(n),/⌊a∇d⌊lT/⌊a∇d⌊lF= 1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingledistF(T,Sd

˜EG(T)≤ −log2(1−δ2)/bracerightBig
. (11)
We refer the reader to [ GFE09] for a detailed discussion on how the knowledge of bounds such as ( 11)
might be relevant for quantum computing techniques and algorithms .
1.2.A geometric formulation of the problem using random polynom ials.It will be useful
for us to identify symmetric tensors with homogeneous polynomials ( and, for notational reasons, to
work with tensors on Rn+1rather than on Rn). More precisely, to every T∈ Sd(n+1) we associate
the homogeneous polynomial pT:Rn+1→Rdeﬁned by
(12) pT(x) :=/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tT,x⊗d/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htF.
This gives a linear isomorphism
(13) φ:Sd(n+1)≃−→R[x0,...,xn](d),
which, when d= 2, is the familiar identiﬁcation between a symmetric matrix Qand the associated
quadratic form pQ(x) =/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tx,Qx/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht.The advantage of this approach is that it connects to well–studied
objects in the theory of random polynomials and it allows to give a neat description of the set of
rank–one tensors, under the linear isomorphism φ.
First, we note that, under this identiﬁcation, the Frobenius scalar product is given by the restriction
of the real part of the Bombieri–Weyl Hermitian product, deﬁned on complex polynomials by
(14) /a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tp1,p2/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htBW:=1
πn+1/integraldisplay
Cn+1p1(z)p2(z)e−/⌊ard⌊lz/⌊ard⌊l2dz,
where dz:= (i/2)ndz0dz0...dzndznis the Lebesgue measure (we show that the isomorphism ( 13) is
an isometry in Proposition 5). This deﬁnes the unique, up to multiples, Hermitian product on the
space of complex polynomials which is invariant under the action of the unitary group by change of
variables. The restriction of the real part of this Hermitian produc t to the space of real polynomials4 ALBERTO CAZZANIGA, ANTONIO LERARIO, ANDREA ROSANA
is still called the Bombieri–Weyl scalar product; the above unitary invariance implies its invariance
under the action of the orthogonal group by change of variables.
The space of homogeneous polynomials with the Gaussian measure ob tained by pushworfard under
the linear isomorphism φof the Gaussian measure ( 1) is sometimes called the Kostlan Ensemble or
theShub–Smale Ensemble , see Remark 3.
Finally, under the map φthe set of rank–one tensors can be identiﬁed with the Veronese variety
Vn,d⊂R[x0,...,xn](d)of signedd–th powers of linear forms. In fact, given a rank–one tensor T=
±v⊗dthe corresponding homogeneous polynomial is
pT(x) =/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{t±v⊗d,x⊗d/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htF=±/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tv,x/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htd,
which is the (signed) d–th power of the linear form x/ma√sto→ /a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tv,x/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht.
At this point we are in the position of giving a more geometric formulatio n of our question above,
which therefore requires computing, for δ>0 small enough, the quantity:
P/braceleftbigg
p∈R[x0,...,xn](d)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingledistBW(p,Vn,d)≤δ/⌊a∇d⌊lp/⌊a∇d⌊lBW/bracerightbigg
.
In this way, we can regard the above probability as the normalized vo lume of a tubular neighbourhood
of the intersection of the Veronese variety with the unit sphere in t he Bombieri–Weyl norm. Thus, our
question becomes:
“What is the volume of a neighbourhood of the spherical Veron ese variety?”
In this paper, exploiting Weyl’s Tube Formula, we derive an exact expr ession for the above volume, for
small enough neighbourhoods. Moreover, as a byproduct of our c omputations, we give a lower bound
on the size of the neighbourhood of the set of rank–one tensors t hat admit a unique best rank–one
approximation.
Remark 3. The properties ofthe Bombieri–Weyldistribution on the space of re al (and complex) poly-
nomials have been intensively studied, starting from the inﬂuential w orks of A. Edelman, E. Kostlan,
M. Shub and S. Smale [ EK95,SS93b,SS93a,SS93c]. The point of view of random tensors has been
adopted ﬁrst by E. Horobet and J. Draisma in [ DH16] and by P. Breiding in [ Bre19] for the study of
the expected number of eigenvalues of a random symmetric tensor , with respect to the Bombieri–Weyl
distribution. Under the identiﬁcation between symmetric tensorsa nd homogeneouspolynomials, eigen-
values correspond to critical values of the restriction of the polyn omial to the unit sphere. Eigenvectors
correspond to critical points of the polynomial: under the Verones e embedding these critical points
give rank–one tensors that are critical points of the distance fun ction on the Veronese variety from
the given tensor. Among these critical points (which are rank–one tensors) the closest to the original
tensor are its best rank–one approximations. In [ Bre19] the average number of such critical points is
computed. In this paper we will instead give the size and estimate the probability of the set of tensors
which admit a unique best rank–one approximation.
The use of Weyl’s Tube Formula is fairly standard for results of this ty pe [BC13,BL22]: it allows to
deduce an exactexpression, for ε>0 small enough, of the volume of an ε–neighbourhood of a smooth
submanifold Wof the sphere, or the euclidean space, as a function of some diﬀere ntial–geometric
quantities of W, called its curvature coeﬃcients. Our main contribution is the nontr ivial computation
of the curvature coeﬃcients of the spherical Veronese variety a nd the explicit quantiﬁcation of the
above expression “for ε>0 small enough” for this variety, through the computation of its re ach.
One could generalize this question to higher ranks by looking at secan t varieties to the Veronese,
whose geometry has been intensively studied, see [ CGO14] for a survey. We propose to investigate this
in future works.
We now describe the main ingredients and state the main results of ou r work in more detail.WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT A RANDOM SYMMETRIC TENSOR IS CLO SE TO RANK-ONE? 5
1.3.The spherical Veronese. ThemainobjectweconsiderinthisworkistherealsphericalVerone se
varietyVn,d, which is the intersection of the Veronese variety in R[x0,...,xn](d)≃RN+1with the unit
sphere for the Bombieri–Weyl norm:
Vn,d:=Vn,d∩SN.
HereN+1 =/parenleftbign+d

is the dimension of the spaceofsymmetric tensors, or equivalently, ofhomogeneous
polynomials. We regard the set Vn,das the image of the spherical Veronese embedding associated to
the Bombieri–Weyl basis, or its double copy, depending on the parity ofd. This embedding is the

is the multinomial coeﬃcient, and Snis the euclidean
sphere in Rn+1. Denoting/hatwideνn,d(Sn) by Σn,d, we see that
Vn,d= Σn,d∪−Σn,d,
where Σn,d=−Σn,difdis odd and Σ n,d∩(−Σn,d) =∅ifdis even. For this reason, we will call Σ n,d
thespherical Veronese surface , to distinguish it from the spherical Veronese variety Vn,d, in the case d
is even. In the projective picture, the diﬀerence between the two ceases to exist:
PVn,d:= P(Σn,d) = P(Vn,d)⊂RPN,
where RPNdenotes the projectivization of the space of real homogeneous p olynomials. Recall that
Σn,dparametrizesthe d–th powersof norm–1linear forms on Rn+1and, therefore, rank–oneand norm–
one tensors up to signs. Hence, the spherical Veronese surface Σn,dcorresponds to an orbit for the
actionofO(n+1) on homogenouspolynomials by changeofvariables. Even moreis t rue: when turning
Σn,dinto a Riemannian manifold with the metric induced by the Bombieri–Weyl scalar product, the
transitive action of O(n+ 1) on Σ n,dis through isometries induced by isometries of SN, given the
invariance property of the Bombieri–Weyl structure. The immediat e, yet crucial, consequence is that
the extrinsic geometry of the isometric embedding Σ n,d֒→SNis exactly the same at every point. The
same conclusion clearly holds for Vn,d֒→SN.
1.4.Weyl’s tube formula and the reach of an embedding. Let (M,g)beaRiemannianmanifold
andM ֒→Mbe an isometric embedding of a compact smooth submanifold. We can c onsider the set
of points in Mat distance less than a given ε>0 fromMand call such a set a tubular neighbourhood
ofMinMof radiusε, denoted as U(M,ε).
It is well known that for smooth compact embeddings M ֒→Mand small enough radii, the exponen-
tial map on the normal bundle provides a smooth parametrization of the tubular neighbourhood. This
description is what really underlies the celebrated “Weyl’s tube formu la” ([Wey39]), which constitutes
one of the main tools to compute the volume of tubular neighbourhoo ds in a euclidean or spherical
ambient space. This formula expresses the volume as the linear comb ination
Vol(U(M,ε)) =/summationdisplay
0≤e≤n, eevenKs+e(M)JN,s+e(ε),
whereNis the dimension of the ambient space, nis the dimension of Mands:=N−nis the
codimension of the embedding. The functions J’s do not depend on the speciﬁc submanifold Mand
are explicitly known in both the euclidean and spherical cases. The mo st remarkable aspect of the
formula is that the coeﬃcients K’s are isometric invariants of the embedding and can be expressed
in terms of curvature, from which they are named curvature coeﬃcients of the embedding. Remark
that nowadays Weyl’s tube formula has been re-interpreted in the m ore general framework of “integral
geometry”, which deals with integrals over a submanifold of polynomia ls in the entries of the second
fundamental form. R. Howard in [ How93] showed how the above formula ﬁts in this context and gave
a full characterization of the polynomials appearing in Weyl’s work.
In the case of the Veronese varietyVn,d֒→SN, the tubular neighbourhood U(Vn,d,ε) gives a
description of the norm–1 symmetric tensors that are ε–close to a rank–1 tensor in the Bombieri–Weyl
metric, in the ambient sphere. As already pointed out, it follows that asking for the probability for6 ALBERTO CAZZANIGA, ANTONIO LERARIO, ANDREA ROSANA
a symmetric norm–1 tensor to be close to rank–1 boils down to compu ting the normalized volume of
this tubular neighbourhood.
For practical reasons, in the paper we will work with Σ n,dinstead of its “double” Vn,d. There are,
however, two technical issues to consider here. The ﬁrst one is th at there will be a factor of 2 to
be taken into account when switching from the Veronese surface Σ n,dto the rank–one variety Vn,d,
depending on the parity of d. The second one is that the intersection of a δ–neighbourood of the set
of rank–one tensors with the unit sphere becomes an ε–neighbourhood of Vn,din the unit sphere, with
ε= arcsin(δ).
This is why we will use the parameter “ ε” to formulate the results on the sphere and the parameter
“δ” for the results in the vector space of tensors.
1.5.The reach of the Veronese variety. Our aim is to exploit Weyl’s tube formula to compute
the volume of U(Vn,d,ε). This requires ﬁrst of all the knowledge of the radii for which the a bove
expression holds. Since the formula is based on the parametrization through the normal exponential
map, the supremum of the radii for which this is a good parametrizat ion, or at least a lower bound
on that, is what we need to understand to meaningfully use Weyl’s res ult. This quantity is usually
called the reachof the embedding M ֒→Mand in general computing it is a very diﬃcult task, often
unfeasible since it requires to study not only how normal geodesics o riginating from every point of the
submanifold behave, but also how and when geodesics starting from diﬀerent points cross each other,
in order to avoid overlappings in the image.
In our case, recallingthe invarianceproperty of Vn,d֒→SNunder the action ofthe orthogonalgroup
O(n+ 1), we do not need to study normal geodesics originating from any point, but it is enough to
choose a speciﬁc one and perform computations involving only geode sics originating from this chosen
one. This drastically reduces the complexity of the computation, allo wing us to obtain the following
result, stated in a more detailed form in Theorem 22.
Theorem A (The reach of the spherical Veronese) .The reach of the spherical Veronese variety
Vn,d֒→SNis given by
ρ(Vn,d) =/braceleftBiggπ
42≤d≤5
1√
2/radicalBig

d−1d≥6.
The same result holds for the reach of the Veronese surface Σn,d֒→SN.
Given the interpretation of the neighbourhood of the Veronese va riety in terms of symmetric tensors
already discussed, this theorem has some interesting consequenc es. In fact, by [ Fri13], the best rank-
one approximation of a symmetric tensor is still symmetric and, by co nstruction, every real symmetric
tensor which is suﬃciently close to rank–one tensors admits a unique best rank–one approximation
(see Corollary 24), therefore we can restate the result as follows.
Corollary B (Uniqueness of best rank–one approximations) .Every symmetric tensor pat distance
less than sin(ρ(Vn,d))/⌊a∇d⌊lp/⌊a∇d⌊lBWfrom rank–one admits a unique best rank–one approximation.
In particular, the normalized volume of a neighbourhood of the Vero nese variety of radius ρ(Vn,d)
would therefore provide a lower bound for the probability that such tensors have a unique best rank–
one approximation. This bound can be explicitly computed by plugging in ε=ρ(Vn,d) in Theorem
27.
Remark 4 (Bottlenecks width of the Veronese variety) .From Theorem 22it actually follows that the
width of the narrowest bottleneck of the Veronese variety isπ
2. Bottlenecks of algebraic varieties play
an important role in optimization problems. For a general algebraic va riety, the number of bottlenecks
can be estimated using classical invariants such as Chern classes an d polar classes [ DREW20 ]. For a
general discussion on this subject see [ DREW20 ,DREG22 ].WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT A RANDOM SYMMETRIC TENSOR IS CLO SE TO RANK-ONE? 7
1.6.The curvature coeﬃcients of the Veronese variety. The other ingredient needed in Weyl’s
formula is the curvature properties of the embedding, in particular the Weingarten operator along
normaldirections, whichencodesthesecondfundamentalform. Againbythe invarianceoftheextrinsic
geometry of Vn,d֒→SN, it is enough to compute this at a speciﬁc point, which we choose to be xd
0for
simplicity of computations.
Beforestatingourresult,recallthatwehavedenotedbyGOE( n)theGaussian Orthogonal Ensemble ,
i.e. the set Sym( n,R) endowed with the Gaussian probability distribution coming from the F robenius
scalar product, see Section 2.1for more details.
Our main result on the extrinsic geometry of the embedding Vn,d֒→SNis the following, and we
refer to Theorem 25for a more comprehensive statement.
Theorem C (The normal bundle splitting) .Letp∈Vn,dand denote by Lηthe symmetric matrix
representing second fundamental form of Vn,d֒→SNalong a normal direction η∈NpVn,d. There
exists an orthogonal decomposition NpVn,d=W⊕Psuch that the following statements hold:
(1)Lη= 0for everyη∈P;
(2)Wwith its induced Bombieri–Weyl metric is isometric to Sym(n)with the Frobenius one.
Moreover, if we pick η∈WGaussian, then Lη∼√

GOE(n).
This theorem could ﬁnd applications going beyond the scope of this pa per. It gives a full description
of the second fundamental form in terms of GOE( n) matrices. Using this description in Weyl’s tube
formula to compute the curvature coeﬃcients of the spherical Ve ronese, the consequence is that the
computation of some integrals on the normal bundle depending on th e second fundamental form boils
down to computing the expectation of a determinant involving GOE( n) matrices. This is reduced to
an easy, purely combinatorial computation (see Appendix C) and thus we obtain the following explicit
expressions for the curvature coeﬃcients.
Theorem D (The curvature coeﬃcients of the spherical Veronese) .The curvature coeﬃcients of the
Veronese variety Vn,d֒→SNare as follows:

We remark that similar results hold true for the projective Verones e variety, using the double covering
SN−→RPN, and for the spherical Veronese surface.
Plugging these coeﬃcients back in Weyl’s tube formula we also obtain th e explicit expression of the
volume of the tubular neighbourhood for radii smaller than the reac h (see Theorem 27), in particular
giving an answer to question stated at the beginning of the paper.

We remark that the above expression, even if unpleasant, gives an exact formula for our probability.
In general this probability has an exponential decay in the codimens ion ofVn,d֒→SNfor anyn,d. In
the case of rational normal curves, there is only one summand in th e above theorem, which can be

2.1.The Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and the Bombieri–Weyl dis tribution. In this sec-
tion, we point out the correspondence between the Gaussian Orth ogonal Ensemble on the space of
symmetric matrices and the Bombieri–Weyl distribution on the space of homogeneous polynomials.
Let Sym(n,R) be the space of symmetric n×nmatrices with real entries and denote by Eijthe
elementary matrix having all entries 0 except for the ij-th one being 1. Consider a random matrix

whereηij∼N(0,1) are i.i.d. standard Gaussian variables. Then Qhas random Gaussian entries
distributed as N(0,1) on the diagonal and N(0,1
2) oﬀ-diagonal, independent except for the obvious
symmetry condition. The probability distribution on Sym( n,R) induced by such matrices is called
theGaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and it is denoted by GOE( n). This is the standard Gaussian
probability distribution associated to the Frobenius scalar product given by /a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{tA,B/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}ht=tr(AB) and
therefore for every open set U⊂Sym(n,R)

Recall that the orthogonal group O(n) acts on Sym( n,R) by congruence. We denote this action by
ψ:O(n)−→GL(Sym(n,R)): for every R∈O(n) andA∈Sym(n,R),ψ(R)(A) =RtAR, whereRt
denotes the transpose of R.
LetC[x1,...,xn](d)be the space of complex homogeneous polynomials of degree dinnvariables.
Denote byρ:U(n)−→GL(C[x1,...,xn](d)) the action of the unitary group by change of variables, i.e.
for everyR∈U(n) andp∈C[x1,...,xn](d)setρ(R)(p) :=p◦R−1. It is known that ρis irreducible
(see [IN66]) and therefore by Schur’s lemma and the compactness of U(n) it follows that there exists
a unique (up to multiples) Hermitian structure on C[x1,...,xn](d)which isρ-invariant, and which is
given by ( 14). Up to scaling, this is the Hermitian structure having the set

orKostlan Hermitian structure on C[x1,...,xn](d).
Restricting to real homogeneous polynomials R[x1,...,xn](d), we deﬁne an inner product, which we
call again Bombieri–Weyl . Notice that ( 17) is also a real orthonormal basis since the polynomials in
(17) have real coeﬃcients. We also restrict the action ρto an action of the orthogonal group O(n) on
R[x1,...,xn](d)and the inner product we introduced is invariant for this restricted action. RemarkWHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT A RANDOM SYMMETRIC TENSOR IS CLO SE TO RANK-ONE? 9
that this restricted action is not irreducible anymore (it is a computa tion to show that the subspace of
harmonic polynomials in R[x1,...,xn](d)is a non-trivial invariant subspace) and the Bombieri–Weyl
inner product is not the unique invariant one. The standard Gaussia n probability distribution on
R[x1,...,xn](d)associated to the Bombieri–Weyl inner product is the one induced by the random
polynomial

The map
φ: Sym(n,R)−→R[x1,...,xn](2) (18)
Q/ma√sto−→pQ=xtQx
deﬁnes an isomorphism of Sym( n,R) with R[x1,...,xn](2)and one can check that the orthonormal
basis for the Frobenius product given by {Eii,Eij+Eji√
2}i<j=1,...,nis mapped to the orthonormal basis
for the Bombieri–Weyl product given by ( 17). It follows that φdeﬁnes an isometry of Sym( n,R)
endowed with the Frobenius inner product with R[x1,...,xn](2)endowed with the Bombieri–Weyl one
and thus we can identify the corresponding standard Gaussian pro bability distributions. Even more
is true:φis an isomorphism between the representations ( ψ,Sym(n,R)) and (ρ,R[x1,...,xn](2)), i.e.
the following diagram

2.2.Tubular neighbourhoods and Weyl’s tube formula. LetMbe an isometrically embedded
n-dimensional submanifold of a Riemannian manifold ( M,g), i.e.Mis itself a Riemannian manifold
with the metric induced by ( M,g). Denote by TpM,NpMthe tangent and normal spaces to Mat
p∈M. Denote also by ∇,∇the Riemannian connections of MandMrespectively. For smooth
vector ﬁelds X,YonM, considerX,Ytheir local extensions to smooth vector ﬁelds on M. Then we
have
∇XY=∇XY+B(X,Y),
where∇XYis the tangential component to MandB(X,Y) is the normal one. By the properties of
the Riemannian connection, at every p∈Mwe can regard Bas a symmetric bilinear map B:TpM×
TpM−→NpMand we call this the second fundamental form ofM ֒→Matp∈M. Given a normal
directionη∈NpMwedeﬁnethe second fundamental form along η, denotedby Hη:TpM×TpM−→R,
by projecting Balongη, i.e. for every v,w∈TpM
Hη(v,w) =g(B(v,w),η).
To this bilinear form we can associate a selfadjoint operator, called t heWeingarten operator along η
and denoted by Lη:TpM−→TpM, such that for every v,w∈TpM
g(Lη(v),w) =Hη(v,w) =g(B(v,w),η).
This operator will play a key role in Weyl’s tube formula.
Remark 6. Givenp∈M, consider a basis {e1,...,en}ofTpM. SetHη,ij=Hη(ei,ej) and denote
byLη= (Lη,ij) the matrix representing the Weingarten operator with respect t o the given basis and
g. It is clear from the deﬁnitions that
Hη,ij=Hη(ei,ej) =g(Lη(ei),ej) =Lη,ij.
Therefore, computing the matrix representing the Weingarten op erator with respect to a given basis
is equivalent to the computation of the second fundamental form o n the elements of that basis.
Remark 7. LetNbe an-dimensional submanifold of a euclidean space with the induced metric and
ϕ:Rn−→Nbe a parametrization of Naroundp∈Nwith coordinates a1,...,an. A basis for TpN
is given by the vectors
∂ϕ
∂ai:=dϕ−1(p)ϕ/parenleftbigg∂

Since the Christoﬀel symbolsofthe Riemannian connectionofthe eu clidean spaceareall null, it follows

where/a\}⌊∇a⌋ketle{t,/a\}⌊∇a⌋ket∇i}htis the euclidean inner product. Let now Nbe an isometrically embedded submanifold of
the sphere Sl, whereSlis given the round metric inherited by Rl, and letηbe a normal vector to
Natp∈N. Remark that we can also consider Nas an isometrically embedded submanifold of Rl.
Then the second fundamental form of Nalongηis the same whether we consider Nas a submanifold
ofSlor ofRl. This means that above formula holds also for submanifolds of round spheres.
GivenM,Mas above, we can deﬁne the ε-small normal bundle NεMas the subset of the normal
bundleNMconsisting of vectors with norm less than ε>0. We also call normal exponential map the
restriction of the exponential map of MtoNM.
Deﬁnition 8. If there exists an ε>0 such that
exp|NεM:NεM−→M
is a diﬀeomorphism on its image, where exp denotes the exponential m ap ofM, we callNεMatubular
neighbourhood of MinM.
Recall the deﬁnition of distance of a point x∈Mfrom the submanifold M, given bydg(x,M) :=
inf{dg(x,y)|y∈M}wheredg(x,y) is the Riemannian distance between x,y. We introduce the
following set
(19) U(M,ε) :={x∈M|dg(x,M)<ε},
consisting of points at distance less than ε>0 fromM. The description of this set for submanifolds of
R3is quite easy: the distance of a point from a surface or a curve will alw ays be given by the length of
a segment starting from the point and meeting the submanifold orth ogonally, given that segments are
geodesics. This situation can be generalized, as the following theore m shows. Even though this result
is well known, we were not able to ﬁnd a full explicit reference for this general setting. We, therefore,
provide a full proof in Appendix A, ﬁlling in the details of the outline given in [ CdS01, Theorem 6.6].
Theorem 9 (Tubular neighbourhood theorem ).LetMbe a compact isometrically embedded
submanifold of a Riemannian manifold (M,g). Then there exists an ε >0small enough such that
exp|NεM:NεM−→Mis a diﬀeomorphism on its image and exp(NεM) =U(M,ε).
Theorem 9can be seen as an existence result for tubular neighbourhoods of c ompact submanifolds and
as a characterization of the set U(M,ε) forεsmall enough. For this reason, in the following, we will
refer also to U(M,ε) as a tubular neighbourhood.
Remark 10. The compactness assumption in theorem ( 9) is crucial. If we remove compactness, we
can only prove the existence of a smooth function ε(·) :M−→R>0such that the restriction of the
exponential map to Nε(·)Mis an embedding, where Nε(·)M={v∈NxM|x∈M,/⌊a∇d⌊lv/⌊a∇d⌊l< ε(x)}, i.e.
theεis not uniform anymore but it depends on the point.
Deﬁnition 11. LetMbe an isometrically embedded submanifold of a Riemannian manifold ( M,g).
We deﬁne the reach ofM ֒→Mas
ρ(M) = sup{ε≥0|NεMis a tubular neighbourhood of M }.
We can restate theorem ( 9) by saying that the reach of a compact submanifold is always positive .
Remark that even if for brevity we write ρ(M), the reach is not an intrinsic property of Mbut it
depends on the way Mis embedded into M. From the very deﬁnition it follows that ρ(M) can be
expressed as the minimum between ρ1(M) = sup{ε≥0|exp|NεMis an immersion }andρ2(M) =
sup{ε≥0|exp|NεMis injective }.
The points where the diﬀerential of the normal exponential map is n ot injective are called focal points .12 ALBERTO CAZZANIGA, ANTONIO LERARIO, ANDREA ROSANA
Their existence is linked to the presence of particular Jacobi ﬁelds, see [dC92, Section 10.4]. For
compact submanifolds of round spheres, one obtains the following e xpression
(ρ1(M))−1= sup
x∈Msup{/⌊a∇d⌊l..γ(0)/⌊a∇d⌊ls.t. γ: (−δ,δ)−→M (20)
arclength geodesic in Mwithγ(0) =x}.
Ifε >0 is the ﬁrst value for which we lose injectivity of the restriction of th e normal exponential, it
means that there is a point in Mthat is reached by two length– εnormal geodesics starting from two
diﬀerent points of M. Using the Generalized Gauss Lemma for geodesic variations, see [ Gra04, Lemma
2.11], and uniqueness of geodesics, one can show that the union of t hese two normal geodesics is again
a geodesic meeting Morthogonally at its endpoints. Therefore we have the following expr ession for
ρ2(M)
ρ2(M) =1
2inf{l(γ)|γ: [a,b]−→Mgeodesic s.t. γ(a),γ(b)∈M, (21)
˙γ(a)∈Nγ(a)M,˙γ(b)∈Nγ(b)M}.
We will apply these expressions in chapter 4to compute the reach of the Veronese variety.
In [Wey39] Weyl presented a fundamental work, answering a question pose d by Harold Hotelling:
how can we compute the volume of a “tube”, i.e. a tubular neighbourh ood, of ﬁxed radius around a
closedn–dimensional manifold in RNorSN? Hotelling himself answered the case of curves, both in
the euclidean and in the spherical setting. Weyl extended these re sults to any dimension nas follows.
Theorem 12 (Weyl’s tube formula ).LetMbe a smooth, n–dimensional, compact submanifold
isometrically embedded in RN(orSN) with their standard metrics. Then, for ε<ρ(M), the following
formula holds:

the euclidean case, the universal functions Jhave the following form:

Moreover, the coeﬃcients Kj(M)are isometric invariants of M.
The coeﬃcients Kj(M) are called the curvature coeﬃcients ofM. The motivation for this comes
from the fact that they are integrals of functions on the second f undamental form of M. Notice that
in [Wey39] Weyl uses diﬀerent normalization constants for ( 23) and (24). We chose to follow the
normalization introduced by Nijenhuis in [ Nij74], which proves to be handier for applications, see for
instance[ Bue06]. Remarkthat the ε’sforwhichthe formulaholdsdependonthe reachandthereforeon
the embedding, while isometric embeddings will give the same curvatur e coeﬃcients. The dependence
of the validity of the formula on the reach is due to the proof relying o n parametrizing the tubular
neighbourhood through the normal exponential map. In [ How93] Howard contextualizes Weyl’s result
in the framework of “Integral Geometry”, where he considers mo re general integrals of polynomials on
the second fundamental forms of submanifolds of homogeneous s paces.
There are explicit integral versions of formula ( 22) for both the euclidean and spherical cases. For the
latter, with the same notations above, this reads as

and it is the Veronese projective embedding associated to the Bomb ieri–Weyl basis. The Bombieri–
Weyl Veronese variety is the image of this embedding, denoted by P Vn,d:= im(νn,d).
The main object we will consider in what follows is the spherical counte rpart of PVn,d.
Deﬁnition 15. Thespherical (Bombieri–Weyl) Veronese map is the map

Thespherical (Bombieri–Weyl) Veronese surface is the imageofthis map, denoted by Σ n,d:= im(/hatwideνn,d).
It is worth stressing in the deﬁnition of /hatwideνn,dthatSnis the sphere with respect to the standard
euclidean product in Rn+1whileSNis the sphere with respect to the Bombieri–Weyl product in
R[x0,...,xn](d)and that/hatwideνn,dis well deﬁned, as one can check by an explicit computation.
The objects we just introduced have a particularly useful descrip tion. Recall that to each b=
(b0,...,bn)∈Rn+1wecan associatethe linearformon Rn+1givenbylb(x0,...,xn) =b0x0+···+bnxn.

as one can prove by showing that νn,d([b0,...,bn]) = [(b0x0+···+bnxn)d]. This also leads to the well-
known description of the Veronese variety P Vn,das the variety of symmetric decomposable d−tensors
onRn+1and is one of the main reasons Veronese varieties have been so inten sively studied. A similar
description holds for the spherical Veronese surface

n}.
Using these descriptions of P Vn,dand Σn,d, it is immediate to prove the following.
Proposition 16. PVn,dis an orbit for the action of the orthogonal group O(n+ 1)onRPN=
P(R[x0,...,xn](d))by change of variables. Similarly Σn,dis an orbit for the same action of the
orthogonal group O(n+1)onSN=S(R[x0,...,xn](d)).
Recall the two-fold covering map πN:SN−→RPNgiven by the identiﬁcation of antipodal points.
Its restriction to the spherical Veronese Vn,d:=Vn,d∩SNgives a covering map /hatwideπn,d:Vn,d−→PVn,d
whose degree depends on the parity of d: ifdis odd/hatwideπn,dis a 2 : 1 covering, while if dis even it is 1 : 1,
since in this case for b∈Snwe have/hatwideνn,d(b) =/hatwideνn,d(−b).
We now turn to metric properties of Veronese manifolds. Consider o nRn+1the standard euclidean
metric and on RN+1=R[x0,...,xn](d)the Bombieri–Weyl one. The metrics induced on SnandSN
respectively are invariant under the antipodal map and therefore induce metrics on the corresponding
projective spaces RPnandRPN. We denote the metrics on the spheres by gSnandgSNand those on
the projective spaces by gRPnandgRPN. Since the covering maps πn,πNare Riemannian coverings
with these metrics, any relation between gSnandgSNwill also hold between gRPnandgRPNand
viceversa. Through a direct computation, one can prove the follow ing result.

4.The reach of the spherical Veronese variety
In this chapter we provide an explicit computation for the reach of Σ n,d֒→SN. The interest in this
quantity relies on the fact it provides a lower bound for the ε’s of validity for Weyl’s tube formula, as
theorem 12shows. Remark that, since Σ n,dis compact, by theorem 9we haveρ(Σn,d)>0.
Recall that ρ(Σn,d) = min{ρ1(Σn,d), ρ2(Σn,d)}and the expressions ( 20) and (21). Using remark 19
we can prove the following.
Lemma 20. The formula in (20)simpliﬁes to
/parenleftbig
ρ1(Σn,d)/parenrightbig−1= sup{ /⌊a∇d⌊l..γ(0)/⌊a∇d⌊l |γ: (−δ,δ)−→Σn,darclength geodesic in Σn,d, γ(0) =xd
0}, (33)
that is to say the inner supremum in (20)does not depend on x∈Σn,d. Moreover (33)does not depend
on the direction of.γ(0). Similarly, the formula in (21)simpliﬁes to
ρ2(Σn,d) =1
2inf{l(γ)/vextendsingle/vextendsingleγ: [a,b]−→SNgeodesic s.t. γ(a) =xd
0, γ(b)∈Σn,d, (34)
˙γ(a)∈Nxd
0Σn,d,˙γ(b)∈Nγ(b)Σn,d}.
Proof.Consider an arclength geodesic γ: (−δ,δ)−→Σn,dwithγ(0) =p1and pick another point
p2∈Σn,d. By remark 19there exists R∈O(n+1) such that ρ(R)p1=p2. Recall that the image of
a geodesic through an isometry is still a geodesic, hence ˜ γ:=ρ(R)(γ) is an arclength geodesic with
˜γ(0) =ρ(R)(γ(0)) =ρ(R)p1=p2. Sinceρ(R) is also an isometry of the ambient space SN, we have
/⌊a∇d⌊l..γ(0)/⌊a∇d⌊l=/⌊a∇d⌊l..
˜γ(0)/⌊a∇d⌊l. We just proved that given any two points in Σ n,d, using the isometries ρ(R) for
R∈O(n+ 1) we can transport any arclength geodesic passing through the ﬁrst point into another
arclength geodesic passing through the second point, preserving the norm of second derivatives. It
follows that the expression in ( 20) is independent of the speciﬁc point x∈Σn,d. Now observe that
given any arclength geodesic γwithγ(0) =xd
0and.γ(0) =v, we can change the direction of.γ(0)
throughρ(R) for someR∈O(n+1) withxd
0a ﬁxed point (it is suﬃcient to choose a rotation Rsuch
that (1,0,...,0)∈Snis in the axis of rotation), obtaining any other possible direction in Txd
0Σn,d
without changing /⌊a∇d⌊l··γ(0)/⌊a∇d⌊l, for the same reason as above. It follows that ( 33) does not depend on the
speciﬁc direction of.γ(0). Since isometries preserve orthogonality and lengths, the sec ond part of the
lemma also follows in a similar way. /square
The choice of xd
0in formulae ( 33) and (34) is motivated by convenience for computations only and we
could have chosen any other point.
The ﬁrst step to compute ( 33) and (34) for Σn,d֒→SNis to understand tangent and normal spaces.

Proof.We begin with the computation of ρ1(Σn,d). By Proposition 17geodesics in Σ n,dcan be
realized as images through /hatwideνn,dof geodesics in Sn. Moreover, thanks to Lemma 20, it is enough
to consider geodesics passing through xd
0= (1,0,...,0) =/hatwideνn,d((1,0,...,0)) at time 0 and their
direction plays no role, hence it is enough to consider the image of the geodesic in Sngiven by
α(t) =x0cos(td−1
2) +x1sin(td−1

not constantly zero are those corresponding to multi–indices ( β0,β1,0,...,0) withβ0+β1=d. To
compute /⌊a∇d⌊l..γ(0)/⌊a∇d⌊l, we need the second derivatives of the non–constantly zero comp onents ofγ(t). These
have the following expression for k= 0,...,d:

Sinceb∈Snit follows that b0=±1. Ifb0= 1, then the meeting point is again xd

Now that we know when the curve intersects again Σ n,d, we need to understand when it does that

now use the others to impose the orthogonality condition.
We look at the case b0= 0 andθ=π

previous computation no other curve satisfying the conditions in ( 34) could have length less than this
one. Fix the following notations ˜b:= (b1,...,bn), ˜x:= (x1,...,xn) and ˜α:= (α1,...,αn). We have

Remark that the same results hold true for Vn,d֒→SN. Before moving on, let us comment on the
meaning of the quantity ρ2(Vn,d) in our context. Recall once again our interpretation of Vn,d֒→SN
as the set of symmetric rank–one tensors among norm–1 ones. Sin ceVn,dis compact and in particular
closed, for every point in SNthere will be a point in Vn,dminimizing the distance between the chosen
point andVn,d. The point realizing the minimum need not be unique and indeed in genera l it is not.
From the tensor point of view, ﬁxed pevery distance minimizing point in Vn,dprovides a best rank–
one approximation of the tensor represented by p. SinceSNis compact, it is geodesically complete,
and therefore there exists distance minimizing geodesics joining pwith each of the points minimizing
the distance and each of the geodesics meet Vn,dorthogonally. From this observation we obtain that
a symmetric norm–1 tensor admits more than one best rank–one ap proximation if and only if the
corresponding point in SNadmits more than one distance minimizing geodesic orthogonal to Vn,d.
It follows that the injectivity of the normal exponential map on NεVn,densures that every tensor
represented by a point in the image admits a unique best rank–one ap proximation, since it will be
joined toVn,dby a unique distance minimizing orthogonal geodesic.
Given this, we can restate the result of Theorem 22aboutρ2(Vn,d) in the following way.
Corollary 24. Every symmetric tensor pat distance less than sin(ρ(Vn,d))/⌊a∇d⌊lp/⌊a∇d⌊lBWfrom rank–one
admits a unique best rank–one approximation.
A consequence of this result is that the probability that a symmetric tensor admits a unique best
rank–one approximation is bounded below by the normalized volume of the tubular neighbourhood of
radiusρn,d:=ρ(Vn,d) on the sphere, that is to say,
P/parenleftbig

In Section 5.2we will apply ( 25) to compute an exact formula for the volume of a tubular ε–
neighbourhood Vol( U(Σn,d,ε)). We stress again that the reach computed in Theorem 22gives a lower
bound to the ε’s of validity of the formula we will ﬁnd: we are guaranteed that it gives the correct
result for any ε<ρ(Σn,d).
5.The volume of the tubular neighbourhood
5.1.The second fundamental form of the spherical Veronese surfa ce.By Remark 19, since
we have an isometric transitive action of O(n+ 1) on Σ n,dby restrictions of isometries of SN, the
extrinsic geometry of Σ n,d֒→SNis invariant under this action. Therefore, if we compute the second
fundamental form at a speciﬁc point of Σ n,dwe automatically know it at every point. We will now
carry out the computation using the point xd
0∈Σn,dfor simplicity.
By Remark 7to compute the second fundamental form of Σ n,datxd
0along a normal direction ηit
is enough to choose a local parametrization around xd
0, compute its second derivatives and take their
(Bombieri–Weyl) scalar product in RN+1withη. This way we will obtain the matrix representing the

Consider the projection on Snfrom the tangent plane at (1 ,0...,0), giving a parametrization of the
upper hemisphere. Composing it with the Veronese map /hatwideνn,dwe obtain a parametrization ϕn,dof the

ated Gaussian probability distributions. A direct consequence of th is linear isometry, of the discussion

Theorem 25gives a full description of the extrinsic geometry of Σ n,d֒→SNin terms of random ma-
trices. From the computational point of view, it allows reducing integ rals on the normal bundle of Σ n,d
ofquantities relatedto the secondfundamental formto expecte d valuesofquantities relatedtoGOE( n)

ing in Weyl’s tube formula( 25), thus obtaining the curvaturecoeﬃcients of the embedding Vn,d֒→SN.
5.2.The curvature coeﬃcients. All this section will be dedicated to proving the following.
Theorem 27. LetVn,d֒→SNbe the spherical Veronese variety and U(Vn,d,ε)be deﬁned as in (19).

Appendix A.
Proof of the Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem. We will use the same notation of Section 2.2.
Throughout the proof, we will identify Mwith the zero section in NM. We start by computing the
diﬀerential d(x,0)(exp|NM) :T(x,0)(NM)−→TxMof exp|NMat (x,0)∈NMfor anyx∈M. Notice
thatdim(T(x,0)(NM)) = dim(TxM), hence surjectivityisenoughto havealinearisomorphism. Denote
byγ(p,v)the unique geodesic on Msuch thatγ(p,v)(0) =pand ˙γ(p,v)(0) =v. Lety∈TxM. Since
TxM=TxM⊕NxM, we can decompose yasy=y1+y2withy1∈TxMandy2∈NxM. Then there
existsσ1: (−δ,δ)−→Msuch thatσ1(0) =xand ˙σ1(0) =y1. Deﬁne a curve σ: (−δ,δ)−→NMby
σ(t) = (σ1(t),0)∈NM. We haveσ(0) = (x,0) and ˙σ(0) = (y1,0)∈T(x,0)(NM) and it follows that
d(x,0)(exp|NM)(y1,0) =d
dtexp/parenleftbig
σ(t)/parenrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
t=0=y1,
proving that TxMis contained in the image of d(x,0)(exp|NM). Now take y2∈NxMand deﬁne a curve
α: (−δ,δ)−→NMbyα(t) = (x,ty2). Thenα(0) = (x,0) and ˙α(0) = (0,y2) and it follows that
d(x,0)(exp|NM)(0,y2)) =d
dtexp/parenleftbig
α(t)/parenrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
t=0=y2,
proving that also NxMis contained in the image of d(x,0)(exp|NM). By linearity of the diﬀerential, we
obtain surjectivity and therefore d(x,0)(exp|NM) is an isomorphism.
As a consequence for every x∈Mthere exists an open neighbourhood Wxof (x,0) inNMsuch
that the rank of the diﬀerential d(q,v)(exp|NM) is maximal for every ( q,v)∈Wx. Up to shrinking the
neighbourhood, we can assume that Wx=/parenleftbig
Ux×B(0,εx)/parenrightbig
∩NMwhereUxis an open neighbourhood
ofx∈M,B(0,εx) denotes the ball of radius εxcentered at the origin in TxMand exp|Wxis an
embedding. By compactness we have a ﬁnite covering of M{Ux1,...,Uxr}for somex1,...,xr∈M.
Choosingε:= min{εx1,...,εxr}we get that
exp|NεM:NεM−→M
is an immersionand a localembedding. Notice that forevery ˜ ε≤εalsoexp|N˜εMis an immersion and a
local embedding. We claim that there exists an ˜ ε<εsuch that this restriction is also globally injective.
If this is the case, then the restriction to the closure of the˜ε
2–small normal bundle is an embedding,
since injective immersions with compact domain are embeddings. It fo llows that any number less than
˜ε
2satisﬁes the statement of the theorem.
To prove the claim we argue by contradiction: suppose that for eve ryn∈Nthere exist ( xn,vn),
(yn,wn)∈N1
nMsuch that exp( xn,vn) = exp(yn,wn). SinceMis compact, up to restricting to
subsequences we can assume that xnconverges to x∈Mandynconverges to y∈M, whilevnand
wnboth converge to 0 since vn,wn∈B(0,1
n) for every n∈N. By compactness of Mthere exists
δ >0 such that for every p∈Mthe map expp:B(0,δ)⊂TpM−→Mis a diﬀeomorphism on its
image, where expp(z) = exp(p,z). It follows that since vn−→0, fornlarge enough γ(xn,vn)will be the
unique geodesic joining xnwith expxn(vn) = exp(xn,vn) =γ(xn,vn)(1) anddg(xn,exp(xn,vn)) =/⌊a∇d⌊lvn/⌊a∇d⌊l.
Analogously, for nlarge enough we will also have dg(yn,exp(yn,wn)) =/⌊a∇d⌊lwn/⌊a∇d⌊l, where we stress that
the uniformity of δis crucial. Since by hypothesis exp( xn,vn) = exp(yn,wn), we have that
dg(xn,yn)≤dg(xn,exp(xn,vn))+dg(yn,exp(yn,wn)) =/⌊a∇d⌊lvn/⌊a∇d⌊l+/⌊a∇d⌊lwn/⌊a∇d⌊l −→0,
and this forces x=y. Then for nsuﬃciently large, we have that ( xn,vn), (yn,wn)∈Wpfor some
p∈M, but on every Wpwe have a local embedding, leading to a contradiction. The proof is co ncluded.WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT A RANDOM SYMMETRIC TENSOR IS CLO SE TO RANK-ONE? 23

whereϕis given by ( 26). By the usual formula for the pullback of a diﬀerential form throu gh a

whereJϕdenotes the ( m+1)×mJacobian matrix of ϕandJϕtis its transpose. Denote by Jιthe

whereIm−kdenotes the ( m−k)×(m−k) identity matrix. Since Jιt(σ)·ι(σ) =ι(σ)·Jι(σ) = 0 and
ι(σ)t·ι(σ) = 1, we obtain
(Jϕt·Jϕ)(σ,z) =/parenleftBigg

For everyz∈Rm−kconsiderR∈O(m−k) such that z=Re1|z|, wheree1= (1,0,...,0). Then we

Appendix C.
Proof of formula (53).We will use the same notationsas Section 5.2. By linearityofthe expectation,
in order to prove formula ( 53) all we have to do is computing
E
Q∈GOE(n)[det(In−λQ)] =n/summationdisplay
j=0(−1)jλjE
Q∈GOE(n)[gj(Q)],
since the expectation of gj(Q) can then be deduced by looking at the degree jcoeﬃcient in above
polynomial expression in λ.
This can be computed immediately using [ Meh91, Eq. (2.2.38)], but we also give a simple derivation
of this computation for the sake of completeness.
First, we write the determinant according to its very deﬁnition
det(In−λQ) =/summationdisplay
σ∈Snsgn(σ)n/productdisplay
i=1/parenleftbig
δiσ(i)−λQiσ(i)/parenrightbig

whereSnis the group of permutations on {1,...,n}and sgn(σ) is the signature of the permutation
σ∈Sn. Recall that for Q∈GOE(n) we haveQii∼N(0,1) andQij∼N(0,1

Givenσ∈Sn, suppose that it contains a cycle of length at least 3, i.e. there exist si∈ {1,...,n}such
thatσ(i)/\e}atio\slash=iandσ2(i)/\e}atio\slash=i. Then, by independence of the entries, in the term of ( 56) corresponding
toσ, we can split the expectation into a product of expectations, sepa rating the term corresponding
to suchi. Sinceδiσ(i)= 0 andQiσ(i)is centered, this expectation is 0 and σgives no contribution
to (56). It follows that the only permutations contributing to ( 56) are those formed by transpositions
and ﬁxed points only.
For such a σ∈Sn, denote by ﬁx( σ) ={i∈ {1,...,n} |σ(i) =i}the set of ﬁxed points of σand by
s(σ) the number of disjoint transpositions in σ. Then we have

and notice it depends only on s(σ). To conclude the computation we, therefore, have to count how
manypermutationsin Snaregivenbyexactly kdisjointtranspositionsforevery k= 0,...,⌊n

this number by N(k). To construct a permutation with exactly kdisjoint transpositions we proceed
as follows: choose two elements in {1,...,n}forming the ﬁrst transposition, then choose another 2
among the remaining ones to form the second transposition and so o n until the k–th one is formed.
Moreover, since the supports of the transpositions are disjoint, the order in which they are picked is
not relevant. It follows that
