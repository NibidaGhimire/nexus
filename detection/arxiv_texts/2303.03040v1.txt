ABSTRACT
Context. The amplitude and morphology of light curves of solar-like stars change substantially with increasing rotation rate: brightness
variations get ampliﬁed and become more regular, which has so far not been explained.
Aims. We develop a modelling approach for calculating brightness variations of stars with various rotation rates and use it to explain
observed trends in stellar photometric variability.
Methods. We combine numerical simulations of magnetic Flux Emergence And Transport (FEAT) with a model for stellar brightness
variability to calculate synthetic light curves of stars as observed by the Kepler telescope. We compute the distribution of magnetic
ﬂux on the stellar surface for various rotation rates and degrees of active-region nesting (i.e., the tendency of active regions to emerge
in the vicinity of recently emerged ones). Using the resulting maps of the magnetic ﬂux, we compute the rotational variability of our
simulated stellar light curves as a function of rotation rate and nesting of magnetic features and compare our calculations to Kepler
observations.
Results. We show that both rotation rate and degree of nesting have a strong impact on the amplitude and morphology of stellar light
curves. In order to explain the variability of the bulk of Kepler targets with known rotation rates, we need to increase the degree of
nesting to values much larger than on the Sun.
Conclusions. The suggested increase of nesting with the rotation rate can provide clues to the ﬂux emergence process for high levels
of stellar activity.
1. Introduction
Planet hunting missions such as the Convection, Rotation and
planetary Transits (CoRoT Baglin et al. 2006; Bordé et al. 2003),
Kepler (Borucki et al. 2010) and the Transiting Exoplanet Sur-
vey Satellite (TESS, Ricker et al. 2014) allow studying stellar
brightness variations caused by transits of magnetic features as
stars rotate. Such brightness variations were discovered for the
Sun almost half a century ago (Willson et al. 1981; Willson &
Hudson 1981). Since then the models of solar brightness varia-
tions have matured and are now not only capable of accurately
reproducing most of the available measurements (see Solanki
et al. 2013; Ermolli et al. 2013, for reviews) but they also provide
a starting point for explaining a plethora of stellar photometric
data (see, e.g. Lagrange et al. 2010; Meunier & Lagrange 2013;
Meunier et al. 2015; Borgniet et al. 2015; Nèmec et al. 2020b).
Recently Nèmec et al. (2020b) (hereafter N20b) have com-
bined the Spectral And Total Irradiance Reconstruction model
(SATIRE, Fligge et al. 2000; Krivova et al. 2003) together with
a surface ﬂux transport model (SFTM, Cameron et al. 2010) to
compute the power spectra of solar brightness variations as they
would be measured at di erent inclinations, i.e. the angle be-
tween solar rotation axis and direction to the observer. These
calculations helped to remove a number of important observa-
tional biases when comparing solar variability to that of other
stars (Nèmec et al. 2020a; Reinhold et al. 2020). Notably, by
employing the N20b model and using the approach developed
by Witzke et al. (2018, 2020) to extend it to stars with non-solarmetallicities, Reinhold et al. (2021) have found that rotation pe-
riods of a majority of the G-dwarfs with near-solar age remain
undetected. These results provided an explanation for the dis-
crepancy between the predictions of the number of Sun-like ro-
tators in the Kepler ﬁeld and the actual number of detected ones
(see van Saders et al. 2019) .
In this work, we make an additional important extension of
the solar paradigm for modelling variability of stars rotating
faster than the Sun. Namely, we combine the solar variability
model of N20b, which was extensively tested against solar irra-
diance measurements, with the modelling framework for com-
puting the surface distribution of magnetic ﬂux on stars with so-
lar fundamental parameters but various rotation rates developed
by I¸ sık et al. (2018) (hereafter Paper I). The Flux Emergence And
Transport (FEAT) model presented in Paper I involves physics-
based calculations of the emergence latitudes and tilt angles of
bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) for given stellar rotation rates,
and the subsequent modelling of the evolution of the radial mag-
netic ﬂux at the photosphere via an SFTM. The FEAT model
is self-consistently able to reproduce the observations of polar
spots that appear on stars with rotation periods below about 3
days (see, e.g., Je ers et al. 2002; Marsden et al. 2004; Järvi-
nen et al. 2006; Waite et al. 2015). Recently, the FEAT model
was successfully applied to the young solar analogue EK Dra
(S,enavcı et al. 2021), to explain the Doppler images that indi-
cated near-polar spots and extended spot patterns towards low
latitudes. In the present work, we extend the model of Paper I to
calculate brightness variations of stars with a variety of rotation

rates observed at various inclination. We also allow for di erent
degrees and modes of nesting of magnetic features on their sur-
faces (i.e. the tendency of active regions to emerge in the vicinity
of recently emerged regions). We compare our results to the ob-
servational trends found by McQuillan et al. (2014) and Santos
et al. (2021) from Kepler data and propose a possible explanation
of these trends.
In Sec. 2 we brieﬂy describe the FEAT model (see I¸ sık et al.
2018, for a more detailed description) and explain how this
model is extended for calculating stellar brightness variability.
In Sec. 3 we discuss the resulting light curves (LCs). These LCs
are then used to calculate the amplitude of the variability, which
we compare to observations in Sec. 4. We discuss our ﬁndings
within the frameworks of various other recent studies in Sec. 5,
before we present our conclusions in Sec. 6.
2. Model
Our model consists of two building blocks: calculations of the
surface distribution of magnetic features and the subsequent cal-
culations of their e ect on stellar brightness.
2.1. Flux emergence and transport
To simulate the magnetic ﬂux emergence on other stars, we
utilise the FEAT model (Paper I).
In essence, the FEAT model extends the pattern of emer-
gence and evolution of the magnetic ﬁelds observed on the sur-
face of the Sun to stars rotating faster than the Sun (and, thus,
more active than the Sun). This is done in ﬁve steps (see Paper I,
Fig. B1):
Step 1. We adopt the synthetic record of solar active-region
emergences during cycle 22 from Jiang et al. (2011). While
this approach cannot be used to reconstruct the solar irradi-
ance on a speciﬁc day, N20b have shown that Jiang et al.
(2011) records allow reproducing the overall pattern of so-
lar variability. Cycle 22 was chosen, as it represents a cycle
of moderate to strong activity level, making it suitable for
modelling the most active stars.
Step 2. We deﬁne the time-dependent emergence rate of BMRs
on a star as S?(t)=S(t)˜s, where S?andSare stellar
and solar emergence rates, respectively, and ˜ sis a scaling
factor. To reﬂect the observed rotation–activity relation, we
followed Paper I and took ˜ s=˜!
?=
, where 
?is the
rotation rate of a star and 
is the solar rotation rate.
Step 3. The resulting input record of emergences is mapped
down to the base of the convection zone using thin ﬂux tube
simulations (Schüssler et al. 1996; I¸ sık et al. 2018) for the
solar rotation rate 
.
Step 4. The record of emergences at the base of the convective
zone is mapped back to the surface, but in contrast to Step
3 using thin ﬂux tube simulations for a star with a given ro-
tation rate 
?. These simulations follow the rise of the ﬂux
tubes throughout the convection zone up to the surface of the
star, where they emerge in the form of a loop with two foot-
points of opposite polarity (i.e. BMRs). An important feature
of these simulations is that they account for the Coriolis ef-
fect that pushes rising ﬂux tubes towards higher latitudes for
higher rotation rates Schüssler & Solanki (1992).
Step 5. Assuming that the size distribution of BMRs does not
change with the rotation rate, we modify the emergence lo-
cations of ﬂux loops, to simulate di erent degrees and modes
of active-region nesting (see a similar approach by I¸ sık et al.2020), motivated by the observed activity complexes on the
Sun. The details of this step will be described later in this
Section.
Step 6. In this last step, the calculated locations of emergence
and the tilt angles of BMRs are fed into the surface ﬂux
transport model (SFTM). The SFTM describes the passive
transport of magnetic ﬁelds of the BMRs on the surface of
stars, by taking into account both large-scale ﬂows (merid-
ional ﬂow and di erential rotation) and the di usion of the
ﬁelds (Cameron et al. 2010; I¸ sık et al. 2018).
In the present work, we employ the steps outlined to obtain
the surface distribution for stars with 1, 2, 4, and 8 
. The emer-
gence patterns of the BMRs (e.g. the input record) for 1 
and
8
are shown in Fig. 1. The main purpose of this study is to
model stellar variability on the rotational timescale. We follow
the approach of Paper I and take the solar temporal proﬁle of
activity (even though it is unlikely to be observed on the faster
rotating and more active stars, we discuss this choice later in this
paper), but we model the light curves only over the four-year
window centred at the activity maximum (marked in Fig. 1).
Our light curves (and the resulting variability amplitudes) cor-
respond to a representative stellar activity level scaled from the
solar maximum. Hence they are largely una ected by the tem-
poral proﬁle of the underlying activity cycle.
In Fig. 2 we present snapshots of the magnetic ﬁeld distribu-
tion on the surface of stars with 1 
(top row) and 8 
(bottom
row) for various inclinations. The ﬁgure nicely demonstrates the
dierence in the emergence frequency, as the 8 
star is covered
by more BMRs. Also the di erence in the latitudinal distribution
is remarkable. This is a result of Step 4 of the FEAT approach,
which in turn leads to the formation of strong polar ﬁelds for the
fast rotator depicted here. We also show snapshots of the mag-
netic ﬁeld distribution of the surface of stars with 
and 8 

for various inclinations in Fig. 2.

right panel. The colour-bar gives the longitudes of emergence and
the vertical dashed lines indicate the 4 years of the 11 year cycle con-
sidered in our brightness variation calculations. No amount or nesting
is included here.
Additionally, the emergence pattern of BMRs is altered by
introducing active-region nesting. This e ect is observed on the
Sun, albeit to a small degree (see, e.g., Pojoga & Cudnik 2002,
who estimated that 40–50% of solar active regions can be asso-
ciated to nests) and it was recently suggested that nesting can be
substantially stronger on highly variable stars with near solar ro-
tation rates (I¸ sık et al. 2020). Following I¸ sık et al. (2020), we in-
troduce two modes of nesting (Step 5): the active-longitude (AL)
and the free nesting (FN) modes. In both modes, we deﬁne a de-
gree of nesting, p, which gives the probability of a given BMR
to be part of a nest. In the AL mode, those nests are centered
around two ﬁxed longitudes with a separation of 180 degrees. If
the BMR is drawn to belong to a nest, then it is shifted to one

of the two ALs (with equal probability). Its new longitude is de-
ﬁned by a 1D normal distribution around the AL (with the stan-
dard deviation 10), whereas the latitude is kept unchanged. This
ensures that the latitudes of emergence still follow the general
trends of the solar butterﬂy diagram. In the FN mode, nesting oc-
curs around central latitudes and longitudes, which are randomly
picked from the unaltered (i.e. non-nested) emergence record. If
the BMR is drawn to belong to a nest then its emergence location
is moved to a random location drawn from a 2D normal distribu-
tion with the mean at the nest centre having standard deviations
of 2in latitude and 3in longitude. For more details on the nest-
ing deﬁnition and choice of the parameters we refer to I¸ sık et al.
2018 for the FN employed here and I¸ sık et al. 2020 for AL.
We show a comparison between the two modes of nesting for
1
in Fig. 3. In order to distinguish more easily between the
two modes, we show both time-latitude (left panels) and time-
longitude diagrams, with the colourbar indicating the longitude
and latitude each. The AL nesting is easier to identify in the time-
longitude diagrams, whereas the FN nesting is easier to observe
in a time-latitude graph.

The output of the FEAT model consists of full stellar surface
maps (360by 180) of magnetic ﬁelds, with a resolution of
11per pixel. As our brightness calculations rely on the area
coverages of spots and faculae, we have to ﬁrst convert the mag-
netic ﬁeld maps into the surface distributions of spots and fac-
ulae. N20b did this by following the evolution of sunspots after
their emergence to calculate the coverage of the solar disk by
spots. While this approach proved itself to be accurate for cal-
culating solar variability (see also Dasi-Espuig et al. 2014) it did
not account for spots which appeared due to the superposition of
the magnetic ﬂux from di erent active regions. In other words,
the main assumption of this approach was that all spots on the
stellar surface have emerged as spots within the corresponding
active region. While this is a good assumption for the present
Sun it prohibits the formation of polar spots, which are observed
on young and rapidly rotating G stars (Je ers et al. 2002; Mars-
den et al. 2004; Järvinen et al. 2008; Waite et al. 2015; S ,enavcı
et al. 2021). These polar spots most likely form via ﬂux super-
position. We therefore take a slightly di erent approach than in
N20b. We acknowledge that, apart from the intrinsic mechanism
in the FEAT model it is theoretically also possible to form polar
spots by overly increasing the rate of BMR emergence (Schrijver
& Title 2001), or meridional ﬂow rate (Holzwarth et al. 2006),
but leaving the emergence latitudes solar-like.
To calculate the spot area coverage of a given pixel of the
synthetic magnetogram returned by FEAT we deﬁne two thresh-
olds: a lower cut-o ,Bmin, and an upper saturation level, Bmax.
The spot coverage of a given pixel is related to the ﬁeld in the
pixel following
m;n
s=8>>>><>>>>:0 ifjBmnj<Bmin
jBmnj
(Bmax Bmin) Bmin
(Bmax Bmin)ifBmin<=jBmnj<Bmax

(1)
wherem;n
sis the spot ﬁlling factor of a pixel with coordinates m
and n of the magnetogram, and jBmnjis the absolute value of the
ﬁeld in this pixel.
In order to calculate the faculae area coverage in each pixel,
we follow an approach similar to N20b by setting a saturation
threshold Bsat(see also papers describing SATIRE, e.g., Fligge
et al. 2000; Krivova et al. 2003). If we ﬁnd that a pixel is covered
already partially by spots, we disregard this pixel for the facular
masking. If a given pixel is spot-free, we calculate the faculae
area coverage following:
m;n
f=8><>:jBmnj
jBsatji fjBmnj<Bsat
1i fjBmnj>=Bsat;(2)
The values of the parameters are selected such that the cur-
rent model returns the same rotational variability (see Sect. 2.4)
for the solar case (i.e. 
?= 
) as the N20b model.
2.3. Calculating the brightness variations
Using Eq. 1 and 2 we obtain maps of area coverages per pixel
of the visible stellar disc. What part of the full surface (hence
the disc) of a star is visible depends on the inclination between
the stellar rotation axis and the line-of-sight to the observer. The
spectral irradiance, S(t;) (i.e., the spectral stellar ﬂux, normal-
ized to 1 AU), where tis the time and the wavelength, is then

2.4. Deﬁning the parameters of the model
As mentioned previously, we ﬁx the parameters of the model
introduced in Sect. 2.2 to return the same level of rotational vari-
ability, represented via Rvar, of the solar case as N20b. N20b
showed that their model is able to reproduce the observed bright-
ness variations of the Sun. The N20b model and the model we
develop here are both based on the SFTM, with similar under-
lying statistical BMR emergence records. We therefore use the
N20b model as our reference in the present work. For this, we
considered the four-year interval (indicated by vertical dashed
black lines in Fig. 1) around the maximum of the synthetic cy-
cle.
We then split the time series into 90-day segments, de-
trended the new time series by their mean value, and calculated
the di erence between the extrema in each of the segments us-
ing the approach outlined above and that of N20b. We note that
we directly consider the di erence between the extrema instead
of the di erences between the 95th and 5th percentiles of sorted
ﬂux values, as is usually done in the literature with the more
noisy Kepler measurements (see, e.g., Basri et al. 2013).
We show a comparison between the Rvarvalues for the solar
case as returned by N20b and the present model in Fig. 4. The
best-values for the parameters Bmin,Bmax, and Bsatwere found
to be 60, 700 and 250 G respectively and were chosen, as they
resulted in a slope of the linear regression close to unity (1.029)
and a high r2value (0.957). The mean rotational variability in the
present model is comparable to that of the N20b model (1459.6

to 1457.71 ppm). However, we note that the threshold approach
used in this model favours spots over faculae. While this is not
necessarily accurate for the solar rotator in the present work, it
leads to the formation of polar spots and spot domination of the
stellar variability for the faster rotating stars.
We present maps for di erent inclinations and nesting de-
grees of the spot and facula distributions (following the descrip-
tion in Sect. 2.2 and the choice of the parameters presented just
above) for a star with 8 
as returned by FEAT with various
nesting degrees (see Sect. 2.1) in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, respectively.
Clearly visible in Fig. 5 are the polar spots.
3. Light curves
Using the model described in Sect. 2.1, we generated a syn-
thetic 11–year–long cycle for each rotation rate considered in
this work. We focus on the four years around the activity maxi-
mum for two reasons. Firstly, we aim to explain the upper enve-
lope of the variability distribution of stars as a function of the ro-
tation period (McQuillan et al. 2014). Secondly, we model a sin-
gle activity cycle, without overlapping cycles preceding and fol-
lowing it. Modelling cycle overlap is beyond the present scope,

and it would a ect the activity level around cycle minima, which
we thus exclude from the analysis.
We note that the LCs shown in this section are 180–days–
long snippets of the full LCs and were simply chosen for demon-
stration.
Firstly, we consider the LCs of stars that are observed
equator-on ( i=90). Figure 7 displays the detrended LCs for
the non-nested case ( p=0), for di erent rotation rates. One can
see that the faster the star rotates, the higher its amplitude of vari-
ability (mainly due to the shorter rotation periods - the lifetimes
of the active regions change far less) which is a consequence
of the activity-rotation scaling (see Step 2 from Sect. 2.1). The
small bumps in the LCs that are mostly seen in the case for the

?=1
are a result of ﬁrstly having all BMRs emerge at their
maximum size in the SFTM. Since the emergence rate is gener-
ally low and not many other BMRs are present, this a ects the
LCs more severely in this low activity case. Secondly, and lastly,
due to the nature of the threshold approach outlined in Sect. 2.2
ﬂux superposition (in case of same polarity encounters) and can-
cellation (in case of opposite polarity encounters) leads to the
possibility of ﬂux switching from being associated with faculae
to spots (or spots to faculae) rapidly. Similar e ects for the solar
rotator will be visible in the following plots as well for the very
same reason.
Figure 7 shows that not only amplitude but also the shape of
the LCs strongly depends on the stellar rotation rate. For the case
of the solar rotation ( 
?=1
, top panel of Fig. 7), most of
the individual dips in the LCs correspond to transits of di erent
active regions (since active regions evolve on timescale shorter
than the solar rotation). As active regions emerge randomly in
time, the LCs appear quite irregular. In contrast, the LCs of the
more rapidly rotating stars show gradually more regular patterns
in brightness variations (see the lower three panels in Fig. 7).
This is because active regions on such stars can survive several
rotation periods. Furthermore, the large amount of BMR emer-
gences over mid- to high latitudes with large tilt angles leads
to the formation of polar spots at about 4 
, with prominent
polar spot caps being present for the 8 
rotator (see Fig. 5).
The formation of polar spots for stars with those rotation rates
are consistent with Paper I and Doppler-imaging observations.
We note that the polar spots in our simulations turn out to be
non-axisymmetric unipolar caps. Their overall structure is rather
stable, because their decay is compensated by the magnetic ﬂux
coming from the new emergences, as long as the activity leveland the BMR polarity orientations are sustained. As a next step,
we consider models with active-region nesting.
We ﬁrst consider the e ect of the active-longitude nesting
(see Sect. 2.1). Figure 8 shows LCs synthesised with AL nest-
ing of 70% (i.e. p=0:7). The overall shape of the LC for 1 

is still rather irregular, compared to the faster rotators, due to
the low emergence frequency. With increasing rotation rate, dips
related to BMR transits not only occur at a separation of the ro-
tation period, but also at half of the rotation period. In addition
to a change in the morphology of the LCs, the variations are am-
pliﬁed with respect to the corresponding non-nested case at each
rotation rate (black solid lines versus coloured lines).
Figure 9 gives the most extreme case of AL nesting, where
we assume that all BMRs emerge in one of the two active longi-
tudes (e.g. p=1). Clearly, both dips (at one and half-rotational
period interval) occur in all of the cases and the LC amplitudes
are further augmented. The LCs in Fig. 9 additionally show that
the two peaks have almost the same amplitude for the faster ro-
tators. In case of the solar rotator and the low emergence fre-
quency, temporarily asymmetries between the two AL can arise
in case of the emergence of a large BMR. However, with increas-
ing emergence frequency, the two ALs become more and more
symmetric and hence the amplitude of the two dips due to the
ALs as the star rotates are, to a large extent, comparable.
We now focus on the behaviour of the LCs in the FN mode.
In Fig. 10 we present the LCs produced with p=0:7. One can
see that the amplitudes of the variability increase for all four
shown rotation periods. The light curves also appear more reg-
ular than those calculated with p=0. We increase the nesting
even further to p=0:99 in Fig.11. The change in the LCs with
respect to the non-nested case is remarkable. The amplitude of
the LCs is enhanced for all cases and the runs with p=0:99
exhibit regular patterns, even in the solar case (top panel of
Fig. 10). Interestingly, in the displayed LCs, not only dips with
separation of the rotation period, but also half-of the rotation pe-
riod (e.g. most prominently seen in the 4 
star) appear. This is
interesting, as the dips at half of the rotation period, appear and
disappear and are not constant, compared to the AL case. We
will discuss this further in Section 5.

Next, we consider the inclination e ect on the LCs. For
demonstration, we limit ourselves to the non-nested cases with
dierent rotation rates. In Fig. 12 we show the time-span of 0–
90 days from Fig. 7 for inclinations of 90, 60and 30. In the
given timespan, for 1

those with added AL-type nesting at p=0:7.

creases with decreasing inclination. The shape of the transits
also change. For 2 and 4 
, the LC amplitudes decreases for
the inclinations shown here as well. Interestingly, the situation
changes for the 8 
case. The amplitude increases from i=90
to 60and then decreases from i=60toi=30. Also the am-
plitude of variability observed at i=30is larger than that at
i=90. These inclination dependencies can be explained with
the help of the magnetic ﬁeld maps in Fig. 5. For the case of 1 

all regions emerge within 30around the equator. The Corio-
lis eect gets stronger with increasing rotation rate, so that for
the 8 
star, the BMRs can emerge at latitudes up to 70,
while a latitudinal belt free of active regions opens up around
the equator between 20latitudes (see Sec. 5). For i=90, the

high-latitude spots appear close to the limb, where their e ect
on the brightness is signiﬁcantly reduced due to the foreshort-
ening. With decreasing inclination, the majority of spots shift
towards the centre of the visual disc and their e ect on bright-
ness increases, so that at intermediate inclinations, the variability
reaches a maximum (see Figs. 13 panel a), before it starts de-
creasing again, as the spots move towards the limb of the visible
disc once more.
4. Comparison to observations
In the following, we compare our model to observational records
of Sun-like stars obtained by the Kepler telescope. Since our
model builds on the solar paradigm, we select stars with near-
solar e ective temperatures between 5500–6000 K and surface
gravity log g4:2 using the updated fundamental parameters of
Kepler stars from Berger et al. (2020). Next, we consider stars
with known rotational periods using the data sets of McQuillan
et al. (2014) (hereafter McQ14) and Santos et al. (2021) (here-
after S21). These constraints lead to a sample of 6,228 stars when
using McQ14 rotation periods and 11,493 stars when using S21
rotation periods.
We express the variability through the quantity Rvar, ﬁrst in-
troduced by Basri et al. (2010, 2011). We use a slightly modiﬁed
version of the range Rvar: we compute the di erence between the
95th and 5th percentile of the sorted di erential intensities. Even
for the latest Kepler data reduction (DR25) it occurs that some
quarters still include instrumental systematics that might inﬂu-
ence the range. We then compute the median absolute deviation
(MAD) of all Rvarvalues, and remove those quarters, that devi-
ate more than 6x the MAD. Afterwards the median is taken of all
Article number, page 6 of 10N.-E. Nèmec et al.: Forward modelling of brightness variations in Sun-like stars II
remaining quarters, which we call Rvar. Since the SFTM returns
instantaneous values with 6-hour cadences, we take every 12th
data point (the Kepler long cadence is30 min) and compute
Rvarfor this unbinned time series. All computations are based
on the latest Kepler data release (DR25) using the PDC-MAP
light curves. We also cross-checked our calculated variabilities
represented through Rvar, with the metric Rperused by McQuil-
lan et al. (2014) and found very good agreement.
Before computing Rvarof the models, we need to add noise
to the light curves. We follow the same strategy as described in
detail in Reinhold et al. (2020). Here, we multiply the noise with
a factor ofp3h=30min=p
6 to account for the di erent time
bins. For each inclination, 1000 noise realizations are consid-
ered, and the mean and standard deviations are computed. This
has been done only for the 1 
p=0 case, as we found that the
noise level is signiﬁcantly lower than the actual stellar variability
in all other cases.
In Figs. 13 and 14 we show the comparison between the cal-
culated Rvarvalues of our simulated stars for various degrees of
nesting in the AL and the FN mode, respectively, and the two
samples of Kepler stars shown as grey (McQ14) and black (S21)
dots. Evidently, if we do not include any nesting ( p=0), our
calculated variabilities underestimate the bulk of the observed
variability amplitudes, especially for the faster rotators. With in-
creasing nesting level (Fig. 13 and 14 b, c, d, and e), Rvarin-
creases and the values move towards the upper edge of the dis-
tribution. Interestingly, p=0:99 in the FN mode (Fig. 14 e)
overestimates the variability of the solar rotators but leads to
similar variability values as the upper envelope of the variability
distributions of the faster rotating stars. We note that, while the
numbers of BMR emerging is the same for a given rotation rate
between the non-nested and nested cases, with higher nesting de-
gree, the spot disc area coverage increases due to the formation
of spots by ﬂux superposition. As a consequence, the spot area
coverage is not preserved in contrast to the approach presented
in I¸ sık et al. (2020) and the nesting has a stronger e ect on vari-
ability in our model than in I¸ sık et al. (2020). We will elaborate
on this point further in Sect. 5.
For a more detailed comparison between the simulations and
the observations, we bin the distribution of observed variabili-
ties. Namely, we compare the variabilities returned by our model
for a star rotating X times faster than the Sun, with variabilities
of a sample of stars with periods in the range [23 /X, 27 /X] days
from the Kepler samples. This comparison is shown in Fig. 15.
The histograms in grey and black display the range of variabil-
ities within each of the rotation period bins. We note that the
number of stars within each rotation bins decreases from panel
a to d. Similarly to Figs. 13 and 14, Fig. 15 shows that the cal-
culations with p=0 clearly underestimate the variability for
the 2
and 4 
sub-samples (while the small number of Ke-
plerstars in the 8 
rotation bin makes interpretation of panel d
rather di cult).
For the stars with near-solar rotation periods (i.e the 1 

case), there is a substantial di erence between the stars in
McQ14 and S21. The sample of S21 contains many more stars
with variabilities lower than the solar variability at the maximum
of cycle 22 (blue curve in the left panel of Fig. 15), while both
samples roughly contain the same number of stars substantially
more variable than the Sun (i.e. the high-variability tail). This
result again raises the question of whether the Sun could also be-
come as variable as those stars in the high-variability tail (Rein-
hold et al. 2020). Moreover, it agrees with the conclusions drawn
in Reinhold et al. (2020, 2021) that the solar variability is not un-
expectedly low but that the rotation periods of many stars with

tiespin the form of active-longitude (AL) nesting. The di erent colours

similar variabilities have just been missed by previous rotation
period surveys (such as McQ14).
At the same time, the p=0:99 FN calculations in Fig. 15
lie towards the upper bound of the variability distribution of
the faster rotators, while highly overestimating the variability of
stars with near-solar rotation periods. One can see that di erent
nesting modes can lead to similar values of median Rvar, espe-
cially if the inclination of the stellar rotation axis is not known.
This degeneracy might be lifted if alternative metrics are used.
We discuss further metrics of characterising stellar variability in-
cluding the morphology of the LCs in Sect. 5.
5. Discussion
The premise of this work was to extend the solar paradigm to
model the distribution of magnetic features on stars rotating
faster than the Sun to use these to consecutively calculate the
stellar light curves and the amplitude of the variability. Figure 15
shows that while our calculations with a rather high degree of
nesting can reproduce the bulk of variabilities in the Kepler sam-
ple they do not catch the maximum of the variability distribution.
This might be because we have used the emergence frequency of
BMRs for solar cycle 22 as reference cycle and scaled the emer-
gence frequency as a function of the rotation period based on
that cycle (i.e. a star rotating twice as fast as the Sun exhibits
twice as many BMR emergences). First, solar cycle 22 does not

represent the maximum level of activity the Sun is capable of
(see, e.g. Usoskin 2017). Second, the activity-rotation scaling it-
self is rather approximate (see I¸ sık et al. 2018, for more details).
We refer here to I¸ sık et al. (2020), who considered the e ect of
activity increase on the variability with a considerably simpler
model limited to stars with near-solar rotation rates.
Empirical studies suggest that faster rotating stars have activ-
ity cycles shorter than the present Sun (Böhm-Vitense 2007). In
spite of this, as the main purpose of this study is to model stellar
variability on the rotational timescale, we follow the approach of
Paper I and assume that the solar temporal proﬁle of activity re-
mains unchanged for the faster rotators, for simplicity. However,
we only consider the maximum level of activity (in a four-year
window during activity maximum, see Fig. 1). Thus, our light
curves (and the resulting peak-to-peak variability) correspond to
the maximum of the stellar activity cycle and are largely unaf-
fected by the temporal proﬁle of the underlying activity cycle.
Another parameter space that we have not taken into account
in this study is the e ect of stellar fundamental parameters (e.g.
the eective temperature and the stellar metallicity). While we
limited our sample of Kepler stars to a temperature range of
5500–6000K, it contains stars with a rather broad range of metal-
licity values. Witzke et al. (2020) have shown that changing the
metallicity for a star with solar level of activity enhances the pos-
sibility of recovering its rotation period, as the star moves out of
the compensation regime between facular and spot contribution
on the rotational timescale. It is less intuitive, however, how the
change in metallicity will a ect the calculations presented in this
paper. According to our calculations, the rotational variability in
the rapid rotators is primarily driven by spots, yet the spot com-ponent is less a ected by the change in the metallicity than the
facular component (see Witzke et al. 2018, for a more coherent
discussion). However, metallicity might have an impact on the
activity of a star and on the surface distribution of magnetic fea-
tures (Amard & Matt 2020; Amard et al. 2020; See et al. 2021)
- an e ect that we deem to be outside the scope of the present
study.
The latitude of emergence calculated by ﬂux-tube simula-
tions (see Sect. 2 and Paper I) puts a well-deﬁned lower limit for
the latitude of emergence, which becomes more visible for fast
rotators (see Fig. 1). This is a consequence of the inward-directed
Coriolis force in the rotating frame, consistently acting on rising
ﬂux tubes having a pro-grade azimuthal ﬂow (i.e., they rotate
faster than their locality). This leads to a well-deﬁned minimum
latitude of emergence, corresponding to the minimum non-zero
latitude of injection near the equator at the base of the convec-
tion zone. Whether such a latitudinal gap around the equator oc-
curs on rapid rotators is unknown (see S ,enavcı et al. 2021, for
a discussion), but one would expect that stochastic e ects (e.g.
convection) can induce scatter around the minimum latitude of
emergence. We reckon, however, that this additional scatter will
not aect the photometric variability to a large degree.
When comparing di erent rows in Fig. 5, one interesting fea-
ture becomes apparent: the spot area coverage is larger for the
free nesting mode than for the non-nested case and active longi-
tude nesting. This is because the proximity of neighbouring mag-
netic ﬂux elements leads to a high possibility of same-polarity
encounters. Magnetic ﬂux, which accumulates this way, leads to
the formation of spots. We note that the possibility of sponta-
neous spot formation via ﬂux superposition has been detected in
numerical simulations (Kitiashvili et al. 2010), but so far such
a formation has not been observed on the Sun, probably due to
its relatively low activity level and a small degree of nesting of
solar magnetic features.
Figures 7–11 show that nesting a ects not only the ampli-
tude of the variability, but also the morphology of the LCs (see
also discussion in Sect. 3), in parallel with the computations by
I¸ sık et al. (2020). For example, in the case of AL nesting, dips
in the LCs mainly occur each half of the stellar rotation period.
Basri & Nguyen (2018) have introduced the "single /double ra-
tio" (SDR) metric, which provides information about the ratio
of time a star spends in single- or double-dip modes (i.e. its LC
shows one or two peaks per period, respectively). The SDR was
proposed to be an e ective metric for characterizing stellar LCs.
SDR as well as other metrics might be useful for testing the mod-
els and constraining the distribution of stellar magnetic features.
Indeed, Fig. 15 shows that both AL- and FN-type modes of nest-
ing can result in the same amplitude of variability, albeit at dif-
ferent nesting degrees. Any metric, such as Rvar, which is used
in the present work, do not take into account LC morphology,
as they only measure the peak-to-peak variability. Using metrics
sensitive to the morphology of the LCs will help to distinguish
between various modes of nesting. This will be addressed in a
forthcoming publication.
Finally, our calculations are based on the assumption that
the size distribution of emerging spots is the same on solar-like
stars and the Sun, i.e. it does not depend on the rotation rate and
stellar activity level. Speciﬁcally, the source term in Jiang et al.
(2011) used in this study (see Step 1 in Sect. 2.1) is based on
the sunspot size distribution during solar cycle 22. This neglects
that the spot size distribution might depend on the activity level
(see, e.g., Solanki & Unruh 2004; Krivova et al. 2021). We note
that increase of spot sizes in the source term of SFTM model
would simultaneously amplify the variability of a star and make

its LC more regular. Thus, the change of distribution of emerging
spots might be another mechanism capable of explaining Kepler
observations (together with nesting investigated in this study).
Since the lifetime of sunspots depends on their sizes, a change in
the size distribution of spots would also lead to a change in their
lifetimes, which would have a very direct e ect on the variability
amplitude and the LC statistics, with longer-living spots making
the LC more regular. In that sense extending the lifetime of a
spot should have a similar e ect as stronger nesting. This is an
important parameter whose inﬂuence will be studied in a future
publication.
6. Conclusions
We coupled the model for the emergence and surface transport
of magnetic ﬂux in Sun-like stars (I¸ sık et al. 2018, Paper I) with
a model for calculating stellar brightness variations (partly based
on the approach presented in Nèmec et al. 2020b). This allowed
us to compute light curves of stars with rotation rates between 1
and 8 
as they would be observed by Kepler at dierent incli-
nation angles. Following up on the ﬁndings of I¸ sık et al. (2018)
and I¸ sık et al. (2020), we investigated the impact of active-region
nesting on the light curves and, in particular, the amplitude of the
variability.
We compared the output of our model to the observed vari-
abilities of Kepler stars in the temperature range 5500–6000K.
In particular, we aimed at explaining the dependence of the am-
plitude of the variability on the rotation rate. Recently, I¸ sık et al.
(2020) showed that the model without nesting underestimates
the variability of stars with known near-solar rotation periods
(see also Reinhold et al. 2020). We found that the same is true
for stars rotating faster than the Sun. Our runs without nesting
dramatically underestimate the stellar variability at all rotation
rates.
We showed that the observed dependence of Kepler variabil-
ities on the rotation period, for stars with detected rotation peri-
ods, can be explained by an increase of nesting degree with the
rotation rate, in parallel with increasing activity level. As both
modes of nesting used in this work led to similar levels of vari-
ability for stars with di erent rotation rates, we plan to further
investigate the use of metrics that consider LC morphologies (in-
stead of the peak-to-peak variability), to retrieve more informa-
tion regarding the surface magnetic activity of stars. Addition-
ally, we plan to include the e ects of di erent rotation-activity
relationships, cycle length and of stellar fundamental parameters
(i.e. e ective temperature and metallicities), on the variability.
The applications of the FEAT model extend beyond stellar pho-
tometric variability, which is presented in this work. The model
has been adapted to study the astrometric jitter introduced bystellar magnetic activity (Sowmya et al. 2021, 2022) and Doppler
imaging (S ,enavcı et al. 2021). It can also be used to study the
magnetic contamination of high and low-resolution transmission
spectra (see, e.g. Rackham et al. 2018, 2019; Dravins et al. 2021;
Rackham et al. 2022).
