 Abstract (250 word limit)  
Purpose. To demonstrate accurate measurement of corneal elastic moduli in vivo  with 
non-contact and non -invasive optical coherence elastography.   
Methods. Elastic properties (in -plane Young‚Äôs modulus E and both in -plane, ùúá, and out -
of-plane, G, shear moduli) of rabbit cornea were quantified in vivo using non -contact 
dynamic Acoustic micro -Tapping Optical Coherence Elastography (A ŒºT-OCE). The 
IOP-dependence of measured mechanical properties was explored in extracted whole 
globes following in vivo measurement. A nearly -incompressible transverse isotropic 
(NITI) model was used to reconstruct moduli from A ŒºT-OCE data. Independently, 
cornea elastic moduli were al so measured ex vivo with traditional , destructive  
mechanical tests (tensile extensometry and shear rheometry).  
Results. Our study demonstrates strong anisotropy of corneal elasticity in rabbits . The 
in-plane Young‚Äôs modulus , computed as  ùê∏=3ùúá, was in the range of 20-44 MPa, 
whereas the out -of-plane shear modulus was in the range of 34-261 kPa. Both 
pressure -dependent ex vivo OCE and d estructive mechanical tests performed on the 
same samples  within an hour of euthanasia strongly support  the results o f AŒºT-OCE  
measurements.  
Conclusions.  Non-contact  AÔÅ≠T-OCE can non-invasively quanti fy cornea anisotropic 
elastic properties in vivo . 
Translational Relevance.  As OCT is broadly accepted in Ophthalmology, these results 
suggest the potential for rapid translation of A ÔÅ≠T-OCE into clinical practice. In addition, 
AÔÅ≠T-OCE can likely improve diagnostic criteria of ectatic corneal diseases, leading to 3 
 early diagnosis, reduced complications, customized surgical treatment, and 
personalized biomechanical models of the eye.

 Introduction  
Early detection and monitoring of  corneal  disease s require better understanding of  
biomechanics to predict and prevent future corneal deformation . However,  there are no 
current  clinical tools that can  accurate ly quantif y corneal stiffness parameters  that, along 
with the intra ocular  pressure (IOP), control corneal shape and focusing power . 
Personalized biomechanical models of the cornea can potentially be used to study 
disease progression and may play an important  role in developing patient specific  
treatment plan s. Non-invasive and non -destructive quantitative measurement of corneal 
mechanical moduli is needed so that personalized biomechanical models can be 
developed.  
The macro -structure of cornea l lamellae produce  a highly anisotropic biomechanical 
deformation response depending on the type of applied  force. As such, measured 
corneal stiffness  is very different when a shear stress is applied along the lamellar 
plane1‚Äì3 compared to a tensile stress along the same plane4‚Äì7. To ac count for the 
anisotropic deformation response, a nearly incompressible transverse isotropic (NITI) 
material  model  based on collagen fiber macro -structure was developed . It was shown 
that the cornea must be described by at least two shear moduli  (in-plane tensile and 
out-of-plane shear moduli) 8, a departure from commonly used single -modulus models.  
Additionally, it was shown that elastic waves in dynamic OCE studies of the cornea 
were accurately described by the NITI model. Non -contact acoustic micro -tapping 
optical coherence elastography (A¬µT -OCE) was used to measure anisotropic 
mechanical properties in ex  vivo porcine cornea, whe re the cornea‚Äôs bounded structure 5 
 forced guided wave propagation and  enabled reconstruction of in -plane, ùúá (where ùê∏=
3ùúá), and out -of-plane, ùê∫, shear moduli by fitting experimentally obtained dispersion 
curves in the wavenumber -frequency domain to the theoretical ( NITI) model .8  
The NITI model was further explored  using both A¬µT -OCE and traditional destructive 
mechanical testing .7 Specifically, the Young‚Äôs modulus , ùê∏, and out -of-plane shear 
modulus , ùê∫, of fresh porcine whole globes inflated to controlled intraocular pressures 
(IOP) were measured with A¬µT -OCE before being cut into corneal buttons and tested 
using a parallel -plate rheometer and then stripped and tested via in -plane extension 
loading. Resul ts were consistent with an order of magnitude difference betwe en in-
plane, ùê∏,  and out-of-plane,  ùê∫, elastic moduli  for all testing  methods. While there were 
some differences in corneal condition during testing (such as curvature, boundary 
conditions, loading type, preconditioning, etc.), it was shown that moduli quantified from 
OCE data analyzed with the NITI model were accurate and provided a non -contact, 
non-destructive path to measure  corneal anisotropic biomechanical properties.  
Because the host -imaging method in A¬µT-OCE  (Optical Coherence Tomography, OCT) 
can accurately (and without contact)  image corneal structure and shape in addition to  
quantifying mechanical properti es, A¬µT-OCE  can potentially provide the  in vivo  
measurements required for personalized biomechanical models  of the cornea . 
However, robust and reliable measurement of anisotropic elastic moduli has not yet 
been dem onstrated in living species . Although elastic properties of in vivo rabbit cornea 
were estimated previously with OCE, the  assumed material  models resulted in  
inaccurate values of elastic moduli because they did not  account for cornea bounding 6 
 and/or cornea mechanical anisotropy.9‚Äì11 Thus, to date, there are no studies 
demonstrating non -contact, non -invasive measurements of cornea shear elastic 
anisotropy  in vivo. 
The primary goal of this study was to test the A¬µT -OCE  metho d using an in vivo rabbit 
model  (New Zealand White Rabbits) . It was chosen  due to the similarities in geometrical 
and functional properties  with human cornea.  In the present study, rabbit cornea elastic 
moduli were measured with A¬µT -OCE  in vivo and the intraocular pressure (IOP) was 
recorded. Following in vivo measurements, whole globe samples were extracted  and 
inflated to controlled IOP for comparison between in vivo moduli and ex vivo, pressure -
dependent  values. Finally, samples were sectioned and tested using both a parallel -
plate rheometer (for independent determination of out -of-plane shear modulus , ùê∫) and 
tensile extensometer (for independent determination of in -plane Young‚Äôs modulus , ùê∏). 
The results demonstrate d that A¬µT -OCE can reliably generate and track elastic waves 
in rabbit cornea in vivo, enabling accurate reconstruction of corneal elasticity. In vivo 
results were compared with both controlled  ex vivo and destructive m echanical tests  
that currently  serve as the gold standard  in biomechanical testing .  
Methods & Materials  
Sample preparation  
In this study, five (5) adult New Zealand White Rabbits ( 3 Female, 2 Male, mean ~4 kg) 
were acquired and housed at the University of Washington Vivarium for a minimum of 5 
days prior to experiments.  All rabbits were treated in accordance with the Association 7 
 for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of  Animals in 
Ophthalmic and Vision Research . All procedures were approved by UW IACUC  
(PROTO202000139) . While in vivo tests with rabbits do not exactly match the blinking, 
respiration, and saccades seen in humans, th is animal study presents a good model for 
similar types of motion expected in human cornea for clinical scans.

Each rabbit was transported from the UW vivarium to a research facility for imaging with 
veterinarian assistance. A trained veterinarian staff ane sthetized the rabbit using a one -
time dose of 2 mg/kg Xylazine and 50 mg/kg Ketamine, followed by a secondary dose 
of 15 mg/kg ketamine at the mid -point of the experiment. All animals were kept on 1 -5% 
isoflurane until in vivo testing  was completed .  
8 
 For in vivo OCE testing, rabbits were placed on their side on a sterile pad under the 
imaging arm of the OCE system  (Figure 1 a). Sterile cotton pads were used to stabilize 
the rabbit's head and align the eye for imaging . The eyelid was hel d open using a 
pediatric eyelid speculum (Figure 1b) and the intraocular pressure of each eye was 
tested using a contact tonometer  (Tono -Pen XL, Reichert, Inc., Buffalo, NY ). Following 
tonometry, at least 10 non -contact OCE scans were performed on each eye .  
Following imaging, rabbits were euthanized  using a 1.5 ml Euthasol  injection and whole 
globe corneas were harvested no more than 30 minutes following initial anesthesia. All 
excess tissue was removed to expose the sclera, and each globe was rinsed with 
balanced saline solution (BSS).  
Whole globes were placed in a mold c ontaining a damp sterile cotton pad to stabilize 
samples and mimic in vivo boundary conditions  (Figure 1c) . A 20 -gauge needle 
connected to a bath filled with BSS was inserted through the temporal wall of the sclera 
to apply a controlled internal hydrostati c pressure ( intraocular pressure, IOP). The IOP 
was controlled by raising and lowering the bath to impart controlled pressures between 
1 and 1 8 mmHg, at increments of 2 mmHg. Each sample was held at the corresponding 
pressure for 5 minutes before scanning,  over which BSS was applied  lightly  to prevent 
corneal dehydration. Five ( 5) repeat OCE scans were acquired at each pressure. Each 
sample was scanned at room temperature and imaging took no longer than 1 hour per 
sample.  
Following OCE, cornea -scleral ring s were extracted for mechanical testing , where each  
ring was used to test the out -of-plane shear modulus, ùê∫, via rotational  rheometry . 9 
 Following rheometry , each sample was  cut into strips for tensile testing  of the in -plane 
Young‚Äôs modulus, ùê∏, using an extensometer . All tests were performed within 6 hours of 
euthanasia  and all samples were transported using cloths dampened with BSS .  
Nearly incompressible transverse isotropic (NITI) model  
The macro -structure of corneal  lamellae creates  a highly anisotropic deformation 
response to force. The primary lamellae orientation (arranged along  in-plane layers12,13) 
contributes to a stress -strain relationship that can be approximated using four 
independent elastic constants ùúÜ, ùõø, ùê∫, and ùúá (assuming small -strain deformation).7,14 
The elasticity matrix in the cornea (in Voigt notation) can  thus be described as:

Cartesian coordinates . Because the cornea is nearly  incompressible, the longitudinal 
modulus ùúÜ does not define deformation, and the corneal strain response to an applied 
stress can be fully defined by the out -of-plane and in-plane shear modulus  (G and ùúá, 
respectively) , and an additional term, ùõø.  10 
 As shown previously, the in -plane Young‚Äôs modulus depends on both ùúá and ùõø.7 
However, corneal structure constrains the lat ter to the range ‚àí2ùúá<ùõø<0, which 
restricts the Young‚Äôs modulus to the range:  
2ùúá<ùê∏ùëá<3ùúá.     (2) 
Although ùõø cannot be determined from guided wave propagation, the limited range for 
ùê∏ùëá suggests that ùúá and ùê∫ can provide very close approximations of full cornea 
deformation s assuming small deformation. While the exact relationship between the in-
plane Young‚Äôs modulus  (ùê∏ùëá) and ùõø has not yet been determined, we assume tensile 
isotropy here so that ùê∏=ùê∏ùëá‚âÖ3ùúá. The approximation  of ùõø=0 assumes corneal tensile 
isotropy and likely leads to a  slight overestimation of  ùê∏ùëá.   
Acoustic micro -tapping OCE system  
A home built AÔÅ≠T-OCE  system launched mechanical waves in the cornea and tracked 
their propagation  in space and time.  The system in Fig ure 1a has been detailed 
previously.7 Briefly , elastic waves  were generated using  a cylindrically focused air -
coupled piezoelectric transducer ( AÔÅ≠T) driven with a 100 Œºs-long chirped (1 MHz -1.1 
MHz) waveform  providing  a temporally localized and spatially focused acoustic ‚Äòpush‚Äô. 
The resulting elastic  wave was measured using a stable Michelson -type fiber -optic 
interferometer where a  broadband superluminescent diode (SLD1018P, Thorlabs, NJ) 
with central wavelength 1310  nm (45 nm full -width -half-maximum bandwidth) was 
coupled  into polarization maintaining fibers and  components for depth encoded (1.5 mm 
effective imaging range) OCT imaging and motion detection.  11 
 The generation and tracking of propagating elastic waves were  achieved using an  
acoustic pulse aligned in time with the start of multiple ( 256 consecutive ) OCT A -scans 
performed at the same spatial location (referred to as an M -scan). Sequential acoustic 
pulses were then generated at a fixed location while the OCT M -scan was performed at 
different locations (256 spatial locations ) perpendicular to the AÔÅ≠T line source 
(generating what is referred to as a n MB-scan15). Each MB -scan provided a 3D dataset  
with 1024 depth x 256 lateral x 256 temporal dimensions. The scan rate of the system 
(determined by the line -scan camera) was  90 kHz, corresponding with a total scan time 
of around 750 millisecond s. For ex vivo scans at low IOP, 512 temporal scans were 
taken to allow the elastic wave to propagate across the full 10 mm field of view.  
The MB data -set was used to reconstruct elastic wave propagation based on  local vertical 
particle vibration velocity ,16 where t he measured displacement sensitivity of the system 
was approximately 1 nm in water. The log -compressed real -part of the O CT signal was 
used to reconstruct corneal structure, and the surface of the cornea was detected using 
an automatic segmentation algorithm. The vibration velocity along the surface of the 
cornea was determined using a weighted -average (one half of a Gaussia n window, 
HWHM = 90 Œºm, weight decreasing with depth) along the anterior 183 Œºm of the cornea, 
providing raw space -time ( x-t) maps of the vertical displacement from propagating guided 
elastic waves detected along the air -tissue boundary.  
For in vivo imaging, bulk motion due to pulsatile vibrations, breath, and rabbit 
movements  can make it difficult to accurately reconstruct el astic wave propagation. In 
this study, broadband elastic waves generated by the acoustic excitation travel with 12 
 energy concentrated in the multiple -kHz range. Because much of the bulk motion 
associated with in vivo imaging occurs in the low -frequency range , a temporal  bandpass 
filter was applied to x-t data where vibration frequencies below 50 Hz and above 4 kHz 
were removed. Additionally, randomly propagating diffuse wavefields17 were limited by a 
directional filter, where a t wo-dimensional Fast  Fourier Transform (2D FFT) was 
performed on the x-t plot and a mask applied to the 2nd and 4th quadrant of the k-f 
space, followed by an inverse 2D FFT.18 Finally, unwanted reflections and forward 
propagating waveforms from sidelobes in the acoustic excitation , or remaining diffuse 
propagations , were removed by applying a moving  temporal window centered on the 
peak of the vertical velocity in the x-t plot. The moving  temporal window utilized a super-
Gaussian (ùëÜùê∫) function (Eq. 3) that followed the maximum vibration velocity of the 
wavefield ùë°ùëöùë§ùëì(ùë•) at each discrete position ùë•: 
ùëÜùê∫(ùë°)=exp[‚àí(1
2 (ùë°‚àí ùë°ùëöùë§ùëì(ùë•)
ùúéùë°)2
)2
]     (3) 
with ùúéùë° = 0.5 ms.  The resulting surface x-t information was used to reconstruct  elastic 
moduli assuming a NITI material.  
Reconstruction of corneal elastic moduli  
Since the cornea is a bounded anisotropic material, an appropriate  model is required to 
describe  complex wavefields and perform accurate  analysis for moduli reconstruction. 
As shown previously and described above, a bounded nearly incompressible 
transversally isotropic (NITI) material model can be used for elastic wave propagation in 
the cornea.  13 
 Once surface waveforms were captured (Fig ure 2a), the space -time ( x-t) plots (Fig ure 
2b) were subject to a 2D FFT to display the waveform in wavenumber -frequency ( k-f) 
space. An inversion  method based on the solution to guided elastic waves in a NITI 
material quantif ied out-of-plane shear modulus , ùê∫, as well as in-plane Young‚Äôs modulus  
ùê∏ (assuming ùê∏ùêø=ùê∏ùëá).7,8 As the resolution limit (determined in guided materials by the 
wavelength and corneal thickness19) was approximately 1  mm, the corneal surface area 
available for imaging (~10  mm) was sufficient for accurate reconstruction of elastic 
moduli.   
Because only the A 0 -mode is expected in the cornea  for the frequency ranges produced 
by AÔÅ≠T, the A0 -mode solution  (detailed previously8) was solved  in k-f space for a broad 
range of input shear moduli ( ùê∫, and ùúá) with a fixed corneal thickness. The central cornea 
thickness was measured in each scan using  the OCT image  assuming a refractive index 
of 1.3831.  
An iterative routine estimate d in-plane tensile and out -of-plane shear moduli ( ùúá and ùê∫, 
respectively) , where the best -fit theoretical dispersion relation was performed by 
maximizing th e following objective function  using simplex optimization ( fminsearch , 
MATLAB, MathWorks, Natick, MA) : 
Œ¶(ùúá,ùê∫)=1
ùëÅùëì‚àë‚àëùë§(ùëì,ùëò;ùúá,ùê∫)|ùë£ÃÇ(ùëì,ùëò)|2
ùëòùëì ‚àíùõΩ|ùúá
ùúÜ|.    (4) 
The normalized 2D Fourier spectrum in k-f space is ùë£ÃÇ, the A0 mode solution for a NITI 
material is decribed by ùë§(ùëì,ùëò;ùúá,ùê∫), and the nearly  incompressible assumption is defined 
by ùõΩ (set to 1 based on an L -curve analysis).2 The value of ùúÜ was updated at each iteration 14 
 according to ùúÜ=ùúåùëêùêø2‚àí2ùúá. The corneal density was assumed to be œÅ = 1000 kg/m3 and 
corneal longitudinal wave speed ùëêùêø = 1540  m/s. The cornea was assumed bounded from 
below by water with a density of 1000 kg/m3 and longitudinal wave speed of 1540 m/s. 
To avoid convergence to a loc al (as opposed to global) maximum in Eq. (4), five 
independent fits were performed, with quasi -random (within a reasonable range of 
expected values) initial values of ùê∫0 and ùúá0. The final output of ùúá and ùê∫ were set to those 
corresponding to the highest value in Eq. 4. An example of the resulting best -fit A 0 -mode 
superimposed on top of the k-f spectrum  in a rabbit cornea  is shown in Fig ure 2c. 
While the optimization function provides the theoretical A0 mode that most closely 
matches experimental data, it does not provide information on the fit quality . Although 
the best -fit line generally follows the spectral maxima (Fig ure 2c), the degree to which 
the theoretical A0 mode follows the measured spectral maxima is not directly 
determined by the fitting regime.  By normalizing the best -fit line to the unconstrained  
global maximum  of the spectral peaks at each spectral bin  in k-f space  (Œ¶max), the 
quality of the fit can be estimated:  
ùëîNITI=Œ¶NITI
Œ¶max,      (5) 
where ùëîNITI describes the fraction of  the maximum mode energy captured by the best -fit 
A0 dispersion curve. A value of ùëîNITI=1 would indicate that  the experimental  dispersion 
curve has the exact match with  the NITI model ( Œ¶NITI  captures all the measured mode‚Äôs 
maximum energy).  Because low values of ùëîNITI correspond with a failure to converge to 
a solution that captures most of the mode energy, it can be used to exclude unreliable 15 
 scans (due to misalignment, rabbit motion, model inaccuracies, etc.).  The output values 
of ùê∫ and ùúá were considered inaccurate for any fit that corresponded to ùëîNITI below 0.87, 
and 0.92, respectively. Details on determining  exclusion parameters can be found in 
Supplementary Methods.  
Due to the maximization approach for weighted fitting, residual errors are not computed . 
To estimate uncertainty  in the final fit value , ùê∫ and ùúá were varied independently around 
the optimum values of Œ¶NITI. For each combination of ùê∫ and ùúá, Eq. 4 was used to 
calculate Œ¶(ùúá,ùê∫), which was then used to determine:  
ùúì(ùúá,ùê∫)=Œ¶(ùúá,ùê∫)
Œ¶max.       (6) 
Multiple  fits were performed  on independent scans of the same sample,  and both model 
and system  error  were  considered to determine  uncertainty intervals  around the best -fit 
values . The best -fit estimate ( ùëîNITI) was determined independently for at least  5 repeat 
scans  (in both in vivo and ex vivo data sets) . The standard deviation of ùëîNITI was then 
used to determine the cut-off value in ùúì for each set of scans .  
Consider  the representative example shown in Fig ure 2d, e, where the mean value of 
ùëîNITI (ùëîNITI=ùúìmax) was 0.98 with a standard deviation  of 0.0 03 (or 0.3%) across 5 
independent scans. The variation in ùëîNITI determined the uncertainty interval using the 
corresponding ùê∫ and ùúá values for ùúì at 0.3% below  the max (i.e. ùúì=.977 for ùê∫ and ùúá). 
This method produced uneven error bars  due to the shape of ùúì. Note that the absolute 
value of ùëîNITI provides an estimate of model error . When   ùëîNITI is reduced, the shape of 
ùúì widens for both moduli and , therefore, model uncertainty increases.  16

example where standard deviation in ùëîNITI was 0.3%. The best -fit solution provided ùê∫=
20.5 kPa, with uncertainty of 19.8 kPa ‚Äì 21.3 kPa, and ùúá= 4.0 MPa, with uncertainty of 
2.2 MPa ‚Äì 8.7 MPa.  
17 
 Because ùëõ=5 repeat scans were taken, five independent measurements produced 
corresponding values for ùê∫ and ùúá, and their respective uncertainty ranges.  The mean 
value of ùê∫ and ùúá for all repeat fits was considered for each cornea (at each IOP) . 
Uncertainty ranges were calculated as mean -squared values of lower and upper 
uncertainty limits in independent  scans. The process provided a value for the OCE -
measured out -of-plane shear modulus, ùê∫, and in -plane Young‚Äôs modulus, ùê∏ (assuming 
ùê∏=3ùúá), as well as error bars associated with the uncertainty  of reconstruction. 
Uncertainty intervals for each independent OCE measured value can be found in the 
Supplemen tary Material.  
Mechanical testing of ex vivo samples  
Following OCE  testing of corneas, c orneo -scleral rings were extracted and used to test 
the out-of-plane shear modulus, ùê∫. A rheometer (Anton Paar MCR 301 Physica) 
assessed the frequency -dependent shear behavior (storage, ùê∫‚Ä≤(ùúî), and loss, ùê∫"(ùúî)) of 
corneal buttons over a range of 0.16 -16 Hz. A 5 N compressive preload was applied 
and the peak shear strain was ~.1%. The test was performed twice, and the mean of 
each run was  used for the final value.  
Following rheometry, corneal -sclera buttons were cut into strips and pneumatically 
clamped ( 2752 -005 BioPuls submersible pneumatic grips, 250  N max load) . A 50 mN 
pre-load was applied to each sample  and stretched at 2 mm/min up t o 10% strain . Two 
load-unload cycles were performed to precondition the tissue . Three rounds of force -
elongation followed by relaxation were performed and  converted to stress -strain 
according to sample geometry. A  second order exponential was fit to three -sets of raw 18 
 data to determine the stress -strain curve. The in -plane Young‚Äôs modulus, ùê∏, was 
defined as the tangential slope of the stress -strain curve. Extension testing provided a 
value for the strain -dependent Young‚Äôs modulus, ùê∏, up to 10% strain.  
Results  
In vivo pressure (Tono -Pen)  
In vivo intraocular pressure was measured  in each eye using  a contact tonometer  
(Tono -Pen XL, Reichert, Depew, NY ). Because c ontact  tonometers have been reported 
to have significant  inaccura cies (with errors  increasing  with greater  IOP),20,21 a 
correction factor was applied  to all in-vivo tonometry measurements  to facilitate 
comparison between in  vivo and ex  vivo measurements . The correction factor in this 
study was determined using a direct comparison of Tono-Pen measurements made on 
5 ex vivo whole globe  samples  inflated to known intraocular pressures.   
As the inflation pressure was incrementally raised from 3 mmHg to 21 mmHg  in a 
subset of ex vivo whole globes , Tono-Pen measurement s were recorded at each 
pressure ( Figure 3). The dependence of the Tono -Pen -measured IOP on the inflated 
pressure was averaged over 5 independent measures and then fit with a linear function:  
ùêºùëÇùëÉùëáùëúùëõùëúùëùùëíùëõ=0.3‚àóùêºùëÇùëÉùê∂ùëúùëõùë°ùëüùëúùëô+6 .     (7) 
As such, in vivo  IOP values  underwent a correction factor associated with Eq. (7), 
where ùêºùëÇùëÉùê∂ùëúùëõùë°ùëüùëúùëô  (corresponding to a coarse estimate of the  ‚Äòactual‚Äô IOP) was found for 
each Tono -Pen determined value ( ùêºùëÇùëÉùëáùëúùëõùëúùëùùëíùëõ ). The result of this test suggests that a 
Tono -Pen measured value of 1 0 mmHg , for example,  corresponds to  an actual value  of 
13 mmHg (with uncertainty associated with the standard deviation of the values at each 19 
 pressure between  ~6 mmHg and 21 mmHg ). The mean difference between the Tono -
Pen and actual values was ~6.5 mmHg  across all pressures for the sample size used . 
As such, error bars corresponding to ¬± 6.5 mmHg are included in the adjusted in vivo 
pressure values displayed in Fig ure 4. All error bars were cut -off at 0 mmHg for display.  
 
Figure 3. Tono -Pen measured IOP  value (mmHg)  as the internal pressure was 
raised using a lifted water bath.  Colored dots and lines correspond with each 
sample, black squares and error bars denote mean a nd standard deviation, 
respectively, and the black solid line corresponds with the best -fit linear function (Eq. 
7). The dotted black line is the one -to-one (slope=1) line for visualization.  
Quantification  of elastic moduli  
Anisotropic  elastic moduli were quantified for each sample in vivo , following extraction  
(ex vivo) , and via destructive mechanical test ing for each sample. A  summary of the 
values measured via OCE  is shown  in Fig ure 4. In vivo measurement s of ùê∫ (blue 
20 
 squares) and ùê∏ (red square s) are plotted at the  corrected  pressure (horizontal error 
bars are associated with the range of possible ‚Äòactual‚Äô pressure values) . Ex vivo moduli 
(triangles) were measured and displayed at the actual IOP value . The vertical  error bars  
in OCE measured values correspond with the standard deviation of the mean in each 
cluster, at each IOP . Note that of the 10 samples tested,  one had a fit quality below the 
exclusion criteria  and was omitted . Because the goodness of fit generally decreased 
with increasing IOP for both moduli, there are fewer data -points at pressures greater 
than 17 mmHg (Supplementary Methods).

squares denote in vivo values, and the triangles are the mean of ex vivo measurements. 
Each black dot is the OCE measured ex vivo modulus  for a single sample at the 
associated pressure (all results shown in Supplementary Materials).   
21 
 A summary of the anisotropic elastic moduli measured in vivo, ex vivo, and with 
destructive mechanical testing  is presented in Fig ure 5. OCE - measured values 
represent the mean and standard deviation of the entire group of 9 samples. For in vivo  
samples, the IOP range (aft er correction  using Fig.3 ) 11 mmHg  on average . The range 
of in vivo ùê∫ was 34 kPa - 261 kPa, and for ùê∏ was 20 MPa - 44 MPa. For both in vivo and 
ex vivo whole globes measured via OCE, the stiffness generally increased with 
increasing pressure. In ex vivo whole globes, ùê∫ increased from 31 kPa ( ¬± 15 kPa) in the  
IOP range from  3 mmHg to 5 mmHg, to 98 kPa (¬±65 kPa) in the IOP range from 11 
mmHg to 13 mmHg , and ùê∏ increased  for the same IOP ranges  respectively from  27 
MPa (¬± 9 MPa) to 47 MPa (¬± 13 MPa).  The values are not reported at higher pressures 
due to decreased sample size with reliable quality of fit. The  mean and standard 
deviation of rheometry measured values of ùê∫‚Ä≤(ùúî) (Figure 5a) at 16 Hz was 75 kPa ( ¬± 
43 kPa). Note that shear rheometry was performed over a lower range of frequencies 
than OCE , which presumably should lead to a slightly lower estimate o f G, as shown . 
The tensile modulus, ùê∏, increased with strain from 2.8 MPa ( ¬± 1.1 MPa) at 1% to 32 
MPa (¬± 20 MPa)  at 10%. The mean and standard deviation of the high strain value is 
displayed in Figure 5c . Corresponding frequency -dependent values of ùê∫‚Ä≤(ùúî) and ùê∫"(ùúî) 
(measured in all corneal buttons with shear rheometry), as well as the strain -dependent 
value of the Young‚Äôs Modulus, ùê∏, along with OCE measured values, can be found in 
Supplementary Methods  for each sample included in the analysis. As  can be seen in 
Figure 5, the range of values measured with all methods (for comparable IOP in OCE) 
were in close agreement.  22

Discussion  
The non -contact nature and consistency of A ÔÅ≠T-OCE make it a promising method to 
evaluate corneal elasticity, monitor  keratoconus , and potentially serve as a tool to develop 
personalized biomechanical models that can predict corneal response to ophthalmic 
interventions. Unlike  other imaging methods, the host imaging modality of OCT allows 
fast, non -contact, potentially high -resolution imaging due to scanning -point focusing of 
the laser light used to recreate structural images and track propagating elastic waves. 
23 
 AÔÅ≠T-OCE potentially can change  diagnostic criteria of ectatic corneal diseases, leading 
to early diagnosis, reduced complications, customized surgical treat ment, and new 
opportunities to develop personalized biomechanical models of the eye.  
Optimiz ing the imaging instrument for human use requires live animal  testing  because 
there are no equivalent phantoms that mimic the low -frequency motion associated with 
both cardiac and respiratory cycle s. Because the animals used in this study were 
anesthetized and stable, bulk motion associated with skeletal muscular movement w as 
minimal over the ~3 second scan time.  Singh et al.32 have shown (in their case for 
anesthetized rodents) that the frequency of respiratory motion and the heartbeat do no 
exceed 5Hz and that the associated RMS motion amplitude of both cornea and retina 
does not exceed 1.5¬µm (sub -pixel in our case). A typical time for blood pressure -
change -induced axial motion is about 1s. On the other hand, the time between each M -
scan in our study is about 3ms ( ‚àº256/90e3). As such, we can infer that recordings are 
not hi ghly influenced by axial motion of the eye.  In addition , the low frequency filtering 
induced by windowing the x-t plot remove s the residual low frequency component. 
Finally, because the top -surface displacement is in -fact an averaged and weighted 
displace ment from the first 200¬µm below the surface of the cornea, small motion effect s 
can be disregarded. Bulk motion in awake animal and human models would likely 
require faster scan times or surface  correction algorithms to account  for micrometer and 
millimete r scale movements.  
Although OCT can provide micron -scale  spatial  resolution, reconstructed  quantitative  
mechanical properties for bounded materials such as the cornea have significantly  24 
 degraded spatial resolution .19,22 Dense-scanning of propagating elastic waves creates  
high-resolution images of local group velocity,23 but these images do not map anisotropic 
elastic modul i at the same resolution . In reconstructing quantitative elastic moduli using 
guided waves, the resolution is determined by (i) the elastic wavelength of the generated 
mechanical  wave22 and (ii) the corneal thickness.19 For AÔÅ≠T excitation, the theoretical 
elastic wavelengths generated can yield spatially resolved  elastic moduli maps with mm -
scale resolution. Demonstration of local anisotropic elastic moduli remains an area of 
future focus.  
An appropriate mechanical model is required to reconstruct elastic moduli from 
experimental wave propagation data. Mechanical anisotrop y has previously been  
confirmed in both ex vivo porcine and human cornea, where the in -plane tensile (Young‚Äôs) 
modulus, ùê∏, is on average multiple orders of magnitude larger than the out -of-plane shear 
modulus, ùê∫. The NITI model used in this work introduc ed two independent shear moduli, 
separating  in-plane from out -of-plane moduli. It helps to explai n the order(s) of magnitude 
difference in corneal stiffness estimates extracted from shear - and tensile -based 
mechanical measurements. The results of this stud y show that A ŒºT- OCE can be used to 
quantify anisotropic mechanical properties in living corneal tissue. As reported above , 
anisotropic mechanical moduli in rabbit corneas measured via OCE under both in vivo 
and ex vivo conditions were in close agreement w ith the values measured via destructive 
ex vivo testing.   
The propagation speed of a vertically polarized bulk or surface shear wave  in the 
cornea plane of  a NITI medium  is determined by the modulus, ùê∫, only. As such,  the 25 
 shear modulus , ùúá, cannot be determined in a semi -infinite or bulk material . However, 
guided elastic wave propagation in the cornea plane also creates a we ak dependence 
on ùúá through boundary conditions.8 As shown here and in our recent work ,7,8a change in 
ùúá results in a small change in the low -kHz region of the A 0-mode dispersion. Thus, a 
deviation of the NITI model from the actual cornea may further worsen the goodness of 
fit and result in a large confidence interval for reconstructed modulus ùúá. A recent 
study28, for example, suggests that the wave dispersion can also be affected by corneal 
prestress induced by IOP and its in -plane boundary conditions, which are not taken into 
account in our study. . Although the reconstruction of ùê∫ seems to be quite stabl e to 
small inaccuracies in the model  used here , this model  can be further refined for better 
quantification of ùúá. Therefore, the reconstruction of ùúá from experimental data is less 
accurate compared to  the reconstruction of ùê∫. Under these circumstances, it is 
important to evaluate whether the measured elastic waveform can be appropriately 
described using the NITI model. To determine whether ùúá can be accurately determined 
assuming a NITI model, a standardized method to determine  data inclusion and model 
appropriateness is very important. In this work we developed a method  to quantify  data 
quality based o n what we refer to as  the goodness of fit  (between measured and 
theoretical dispersion curves) . Using a statistical analysis of experime ntal data, we have 
shown that t he reconstruction of ùê∫ and ùúá can be considered correct for any fit when 
ùëîNITI is above 0.87, and 0.92, respectively. Details on the determination of exclusion 
parameters can be found in Supplementary Methods.  
Another impor tant note is that this work assumed tensile isotropy of elastic moduli in the 
cornea, i.e. ùê∏ùëá= ùê∏ùêø=3ùúá. Most likely, this assumption requires further refinement of the 26 
 NITI model , particularly in the definition of the proportionality coefficient between  ùê∏ùëá and 
ùúá. Since corneal shear anisotropy is extremely strong, we expect this relationship to be  
closer to ùê∏ùëá=2ùúá. Measur ing the exact relationship on a large population of cornea 
samples will be a part of our future studies. Here, however, we prefer to keep the 
relationship ùê∏=ùê∏ùëá= ùê∏ùêø=3ùúá until it is accurately measured.  
The cornea is  also unique in that the fibers are pre -stress ed by the intraocular pressure.  
Both ùê∫ and ùê∏ increased with intraocular pressure  for in vivo and ex vivo measurements . 
Additionally, the stress -strain curves in Supplementary Materials show that tensile 
Young‚Äôs Modulus ùê∏ is strain dependent . Clearly, the pre -strain condition will play a role 
in measured corneal stiffness. As an aside , it has also been shown that increased 
stress plays a role in the propagation behavior of elastic waves , even for linear elastic 
materials.24,29 Different techniques have shown the possibility of disentangl ing the effect 
of IOP induced pre -stress from the change of stiffness for linearly isotropic solids.28-30 
Decoupling non -linear mechanical responses from strain -induced changes  in wave 
speed  for anisotropic materials  remain s an area of future interest.  
In this work we  also assume d that both ùê∏ and ùê∫ are real  moduli , i.e. the loss modulus 
related to tissue viscosity is assumed negligibly small. As can be seen in the rheometry 
plots shown in Supplementary Methods, ùê∫ has a non -zero loss modulus and the 
frequency response is consistent with a measurable viscosity. Methods to estimate 
corneal viscosity (such as by tracking elastic wave energy) are currently under 
investigation. However, we notice here that cornea viscosity mostly affects the higher 
frequency range of the dispersion relationship for  the ùê¥0 mode ,25,26 and thus has very 27 
 little effect on values estimated from the real part of moduli. In other words, the cornea 
loss modulus is not measured in this study, but introducing complex elastic moduli into 
the NITI  model would  produce  small  change s in the reconstru cted elastic (real) part of 
moduli . 
The in vivo measurement of intraocular pressure was performed using a contact Tono -
Pen. Consistent with previously reported results,20,21 the mean tonometry -measured 
IOP generally underestimated the actual IOP at high pressures, with  very large  
individual variability between samples. One limitation  in the present study was that only 
5 samples were used to create the correction factor. Due to large individual variations, a 
more accurate correction factor would require a much larger population sample size. 
Because contact tonometers  (such as the Tono -Pen) use a simple model to estimate 
internal pressure based on displacement of the cornea, the final  value it measures is 
inherently linked to  not only IOP, but also  to cornea  biomechanics . Independent 
measurements of corneal elastic mod uli may help to develop better mechanical models 
that can potentially lead to more accurate estimat es of IOP.  
In comparing  measured moduli  between in vivo and ex vivo studies and between OCE 
measurement and mechanical tests, we note that  sample boundary conditions were 
quite different for the  different methods . In vivo scans were perfo rmed with the cornea 
intact, where the whole  globe was held in place via ocular muscles and under normal 
IOP. Ex vivo scans attempted to match in vivo conditions ; however,  whole globes were 
no longer vascularized and ocular muscles no longer attached. Even more significant, 
rheometry and tensile test ing required that the cornea was excised from the sclera and 28 
 physically altered . Such alterations change the macro -structure and can release tension 
within lamellae. Additionally, the loading direction was different in ex vivo samples. 
Thus, identical valu es of moduli extracted with the different methods used in this study 
was not expected. Still, the results  were in relatively close agreement.  
In addition, shear rheometry and OCE methods determine the out -of-plane shear 
modulus, ùê∫, at different frequencie s. Where as rheometry operates in the Hz -range, 
OCE operates  in the multiple -kHz regime. As can be seen in the individual plots shown 
in Supplementary Methods, the apparent modulus , ùê∫, increases with increasing 
frequency, suggesting that the OCE results re ported in Figure 5  would be higher than 
the expected shear modulus of the cornea under lower frequency shear strain, as well 
as under typical biological shear strain rates (due to eye rubbing, for example). 
However, the results obtained with all methods we re still in relatively close agreement, 
which supports the NITI model for  reconstruction of cornea moduli from OCE data.  
We also note a decrease in fit quality with increasing IOP (Supplementary Methods). 
Because increasing IOP has been shown to introduce an additional degree of 
anisotropy,27 rabbit cornea may not be accurately described by the NITI model at high 
IOP (above 15 mmHg), and an orthotropic model (and, the refore, a larger number of 
elastic moduli) may be  required.  
Conclusions  
Humans and rabbits share many common genetic features and by examining the 
physiology, anatomy and mechanical structures of the living rabbit, scientists can gain 29 
 valuable insight s into human  function. In this study, the anisotropic shear moduli of 
rabbit corneas were measured in living animals and validated using multiple ex vivo 
measurement techniques on the same set of samples. The results of this work suggest 
that accurate in vivo m easurements of human corneal moduli can be made using AÔÅ≠T-
OCE , an important step toward supporting clinical adoption.

Supplemental Methods  
 
1. Quality of fi t and generation of uncertainty intervals  
While ùëîNITI (Eq. 5, see Methods) provides an estimate for how well the theoretical A0 
mode matches experimental data, it alone does not provide confidence intervals on the 
output moduli ùê∫ and ùúá. Due to the maximization approach for weighted fitting based on 
the energy in the 2 -D Fourier transform  use in this study , residual errors are no t 
computed, making traditional confidence interval methods difficult to apply. For 
example, a low value of ùëîNITI would suggest that the A0 dispersion curve calculated 
from the NITI model poorly described the actual dispersion measured within the sample. 
In such case, modulus estimates should  have increased uncertainty.  
To estimate uncertainty, ùê∫ and ùúá were varied independently around the values near a 
maximum ùëîNITI and Œ¶(ùúá,ùê∫) was recorded. For each combination of ùê∫ and ùúá, Eq. 4 
(Methods)  was used to calculate Œ¶(ùúá,ùê∫), which was then used to determine:  ùúì(ùúá,ùê∫)=Œ¶(ùúá,ùê∫)
Œ¶max , (S.1) 
where the ùúì function represented goodness of fit values normalized to the maximum 
energy for a range of values. A representative example of ùúì(ùúá,ùê∫) can be seen in Fig ure 
S1. Here ( x-t plot shown in Figure S1a), the iterative routine converged on a best -fit A 0 
mode ( Figure S1b) where ùëîNITI =0.98 when ùê∫=20.5 kPa and ùúá=4 MPa.  In Figure 
S1c, ùúì is shown for ùê∫‚àà [10 ‚Äì 40] kPa and ùúá‚àà [1 ‚Äì 50] MPa. It highlights the high 
sensitivity of ùúì to a change in ùê∫ while it remains relatively stable while ùúá varies.  In 
Figure S1d, ùúì is shown when  ùúá=4 MPa and ùê∫ was varied from 10 kPa- 40 kPa. The 
corresponding A0 dispersion curves (constitutive equation found in Ref2) as ùê∫ varied 
can be seen in Figure S1f. As described previously, the high -frequency threshold of the 
A0 dispersion curve is largely determined by ùê∫. In Figure S1e, ùúì is shown when  ùê∫=
20.5 kPa and ùúá swept across a 1 MPa - 50 MPa range. Again, the corresponding A0 
dispersion curves can be seen in Figure S1g. As suggested previously, the A0 mode is 
not as sensitive to changes in ùúá for the degree of shear anisotropy ( ùúá/ùê∫) expected in 
the cornea. As such, ùúì is less sensitive to changes in ùúá and produces higher relative 
uncertainty  (see also Figure S1c) . This routine provided a range for both ùê∫ and ùúá values 
indicating the degree  to which the iterative solution converged on a single value.

ùê∫=20.5 kPa.  
Due to the shape of ùúì, the uncertainty in the fit produced uneven error bars. Note that 
the absolute value of ùëîNITI provides an estimate for model error, where ùëîNITI  =1 for a 
NITI material would have very small uncertainty intervals. As ùëîNITI is reduced, the shape 
of ùúì widens for both moduli and model uncertainty increases.  
Because n=5 repeat scans were taken, five independent measurements produced 
corresponding values for ùê∫ and ùúá and their respective uncertainty ranges. The 
uncertainty ranges for each cornea (at each  IOP) were finally calculated by taking the 
square -root of the means of the upper and lower limits, divided by the number of scans 
(n=5).  
2. Exclusion criteria   
In cases  where t he NITI model does not describe measured wavefields properly (due to 
poor excitation, misalignment, corneal structure abnormalities, etc.) , the iterative fitting 
routine will arrive at a modulus value that has little to no physical meaning. To determine 
cases where the measured wavefields are accurately described by the NITI mod el, a ‚Äòcut -
off‚Äô criterion in the goodness of fit for both ùê∫ and ùúá was determined. Any scan with a 
goodness of fit below the cut -off value was omitted from analysis.  
To determine the relationship between ùëîNITI and model error in rabbit corneas, an iterative 
fit was performed and ùëîNITI calculated for all OCE scans  (at all pressures) , providing 
ùëîNITI/moduli histograms  (Figures S2a-b). Each section of the histograms correspond s to a 0.01 range in ùëîNITI, 5 kPa for ùê∫, and 2 MPa for ùúá. These histograms illustrate the 
repartition of moduli obtained from the fits and show, as expected, a stable repartition of 
moduli in the high goodness of fit range . 
In order to determine critical ùëîNITI value s, histograms were integrated in the ùëîNITI 
direction. For every modulus range, the number of occurrences was counted and the 
mean ùëîNITI computed. These results are shown in Fig ures S2c-d. The modulus clearly 
increases (associated with faster wave speeds) as ùëîNITI decreases progressively before 
approaching a point where this behavior breaks, reaching a plateau. The plateau is 
associated with nearly random statistics for reconstructed moduli, corresponding to the 
range of ùëîNITI below which the fitting proc edure used for moduli reconstruction is 
inaccurate. The final cutoff value was computed as the average ùëîNITI over the plateau 
range. Table S1 presents the cutoff goodness of fit ( ùëîNITI) criteria determined by the 
method detailed above for both ùê∫ and ùúá

standard devi ation in the measured goodness of fit. The black line and gray shaded 
area indicate the range over which the cutoff ùëîNITI was calculated. Exact  values for the 
cutoff ùëîNITI are given in Table S1).

3. Mechanical testing results for individual cornea samples  
Each cornea was first tested with OCE in  vivo, where at least 10 non -contact OCE 
scans were performed on each eye. Once  in vivo measurements  were performed , the 
pressure  was measured with a Tono-Pen. Following in vivo measurements, euthanasia 
was performed and whole globe corneas were harvested. Whole globes were placed in 
a mold containing a damp sterile cotton pad to stabilize samples and mimic in vivo 
boundary conditions. A 20 -gauge needle connected to a bath  filled with BSS was 
inserted through the temporal wall of the sclera to apply a controlled internal hydrostatic 
pressure (IOP)  ranging from 1 mmHg to 23 mmHg . Each sample was scanned at room 
temperature and imaging took no longer than 1 hour per sample. A fter A ¬µT-OCE, 
corneal  buttons were  cut and  rheometry measurements were performed . Each corneal 
button then was sectioned into strips approximately 6 mm wide along the nasotemporal 
axis of the cornea and subject to tensile testing up to 10% strain. The ela stic moduli 
quantified  from all tests, for all corneas, are shown below  (Figure S3 - Figure S11) . All ex 
vivo data were acquired within 6 hours of animal euthanasia. The corresponding ùëîNITI 
for all OCE measurements are also included in Figure S12 - Figure S 20.
