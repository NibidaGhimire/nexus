In this article, we investigate periodically driven open quantum systems within the framework
of Floquet-Lindblad master equations. Specifically, we discuss Lindblad master equations in the
presence of a coherent, time-periodic driving and establish their general spectral features. We also
clarify the notions of transient and non-decaying solutions from this spectral perspective, and then
prove that any physical system described by a Floquet-Lindblad equation must have at least one
physical non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), corresponding to an eigenoperator of the Floquet-
Lindblad evolution superoperator UFwith unit eigenvalue. Since the Floquet-Lindblad formalism
encapsulates the entire information regarding the NESS, it in principle enables us to obtain non-
linear effects to all orders at once. The Floquet-Lindblad formalism thus provides a powerful tool for
studying driven-dissipative solid-state systems, which we illustrate by deriving the nonlinear optical
response of a simple two-band model of an insulating solid and comparing it with prior results
established through Keldysh techniques.
I. INTRODUCTION
Open quantum many-body systems are a cornerstone
of modern physics and have been a focus of intense recent
research, driven partly by the advent of NISQ-era devices
[1]. From a theoretical perspective, open systems are of
fundamental interest since the interplay between coher-
ent Hamiltonian dynamics and dissipative processes often
gives rise to novel phenomena with no equilibrium coun-
terpart (see Refs. [2, 3] for a review). Moreover, since re-
alistic systems are always coupled to an external environ-
ment, understanding the effect of such an environment on
the equilibrium phases of matter presents an important
challenge. Aside from certain special cases, however, it is
unfeasible to exactly treat the bath dynamics and vari-
ous approximations are used to capture the effects of the
environment on the system whilst only keeping track of
the system degrees of freedom.
Often, it is appropriate to work in the Markovian
regime, where the system is appropriately described in
terms of a quantum master equation [4], of which the
Lindblad (or GKLS) master equation [5, 6] is the most
widely applicable and has contributed significantly to our
understanding of quantum systems coupled weakly to an
environment [7–18]. In short, the Lindblad equation pro-
vides a general description of the dynamics of a system

(see, however, Ref. [19] for limitations of the Lindblad
equation): under these standard Born-Markov assump-
tions, the system’s density operator evolves according

(in units where ℏ= 1). In this equation, the Liouville
superoperator Lis a linear operator acting on the Liou-
ville space H⊗H∗, whereHdenotes the Hilbert space
of the system alone. The Liouville superoperator consists
of two distinct parts: the first part corresponds to the
Hamiltonian Hof the system and generates the coherent
evolution, while the second part contains so-called “jump
operators” Lµthat capture the average influence of the
system-reservoir coupling in the weakly-coupled Marko-
vian limit. The coupling strengths of these jump opera-
tors are specified by nonnegative damping rates Γ µ≥0.
The most important property of the Lindblad equa-
tion is that it generates a quantum dynamical map that
iscompletely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) [5, 6,
20], which implies that the time evolution generated by
Lwill keep Tr ρ(t) unchanged and will preserve the semi-
definiteness of ρ(t) at any future time t[21]. The CPTP
conditions ensure that a physical initial state ρ(t0) re-
mains physical at all future times t > t 0, where by a
physical (mixed) state we mean a positive semi-definite
and Hermitian density matrix with unit trace. Note thatarXiv:2401.00131v3  [quant-ph]  15 Apr 20242
the dynamical map generated by Lis CPTP for any given
choice of Hamiltonian Hand jump operators Lµas long
as Γ µ≥0. Specifically, if all Γ µ= 0, the Lindblad equa-
tion reduces to the von Neumann equation ˙ ρ=−i[H, ρ]
that describes the unitary evolution of an isolated quan-
tum system.
In the presence of a time-independent Hamiltonian and
time-independent jump operators Lµ, the evolution from
a generic initial state typically contains two components:
a transient component that eventually decays out, and
a non-decaying component that is a linear combination
of eigenoperators of Lwhose eigenvalues have zero real
parts (see Appendix A). As a consequence of the rela-
tion between the dynamics of the system density matrix
ρ(t) and the eigenoperators of the superoperator L, the
spectrum of Lhas recently been an object of significant
interest [22–26]. It is worth noting that each individual
eigenoperator of Lis generically nota physical density
matrix as most of them are non-Hermitian and traceless.
Recently, attention has turned towards the dynamics
of periodically driven open quantum systems, where the
competition between coherent external driving and in-
coherent dissipation has been experimentally observed
to stabilize non-trivial non-equilibrium steady states
(NESS) in e.g., coupled arrays of circuit QED res-
onators [27, 28]. In such open Floquet systems [29–33],
the Liouville superoperator satisfies L(t+T) =L(t)
(with Tthe period). For closed quantum systems, such
time-dependent problems are solved using Floquet the-
ory, which generalizes the energy eigenstates of time-
independent systems to Floquet eigenmodes with the
same period T(see Ref. [34] and Appendix B for details).
However, due to the intrinsic non-unitary evolution of
open quantum systems, strategies from the Floquet the-
ory for closed systems cannot be directly applied in this
setting [35]. For instance, prior studies have shown that
the concept of a Floquet Hamiltonian (or more gener-
ically, a Floquet Liouville superoperator), which exists
for periodically driven closed quantum systems, does not
always exist for open quantum systems [33, 36–38] and
the non-unitary evolution can lead to difficulties in prop-
erly defining Floquet eigenmodes (see Ref. [39] for an
algorithm for getting NESS without involving Floquet
formalism).
In this article, we formulate the Floquet theory of pe-
riodically driven open quantum systems which are de-
scribed by time-dependent Lindblad master equations.
We define the Floquet-Lindblad eigenmodes and prove
the spectral properties of the Floquet-Lindblad evolu-
tion superoperator UF(defined in Eq.(4)). As a conse-
quence of these spectral features, we show that, as in
the time-independent situation, there always exists at
least one physical eigenoperator ρ0ofUFwith unit eigen-
value, which corresponds to the time-dependent non-
equilibrium steady state (NESS) of the system. To il-
lustrate this formalism, we consider a simple two-band
model of an insulating solid and derive its nonlinear op-
tical response, which was previously established usingKeldysh Greens’ function techniques in Ref. [40].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II,
we introduce the setup of Floquet-Lindblad equations,
define the Floquet-Lindblad evolution superoperator UF
and the corresponding time-periodic Floquet-Lindblad
eigenmodes, and explain the physical importance of the
spectrum of UF. Then, the spectral properties of UFare
discussed in Sec. III, particularly for the situation that
UFis not diagonalizable. In Sec. IV, we illustrate the
Floquet-Lindblad formalism by deriving the nonlinear
optical response in a simple two-band insulator within
certain approximations. We conclude in Sec. V with a
brief discussion of future directions.
II. FLOQUET-LINDBLAD EIGENMODES
We focus on the problem of how an open quantum sys-
tem interacts with a periodically varying time-dependent
external field with period T. We limit ourselves to the
simple situation in which the external field is only cou-
pled to the system, such that the environment remains
at thermal equilibrium at all times. Moreover, we assume
throughout that we are in a regime in which the Born-
Markov approximations hold. Consequently, after inte-
grating out the degrees of freedom of the environment,
the equation of motion for the reduced density matrix
ρ(t) of the system takes the form Eq. (1), i.e., for each
fixed time tthe dissipation terms are in Lindblad form,
with both the Hamiltonian H(t) and the jump opera-
torsLµ(t) depending explicitly on time tand having the
same period Tas the external field [4]. As the micro-
scopic derivation of the equation of motion in Lindlbad
form involves the Floquet theory, we will refer to it as
theFloquet-Lindblad equation [32, 38, 41–45] throughout
this paper.
The Floquet-Lindblad equation takes the form:
dρ
dt=L(t)ρ
≡ −i[H(t), ρ] +X
µΓµ
Lµ(t)ρL†
µ(t)−1
2{L†
µ(t)Lµ(t), ρ}
,
(2)
where the Liouville superoperator is time-periodic L(t) =
L(t+T). In this article, we only consider systems with a
finite-dimensional Hilbert space H, with the correspond-
ing Liouville space given by H⊗H∗. We emphasize here
that the Floquet-Lindblad equation only applies to the
situations where the Born-Markov approximation holds
[4], otherwise the dynamics of the environment will gener-
ically make the system’s dynamics non-local in time and
thus cannot be simply expressed by a superoperator L(t).
In more general cases beyond Born-Markov approxima-
tion, not only does the master equation fail to exhibit the
structure described in Eq. (2), but also a time-periodic
external driving does not necessarily result in periodic
time dependence.3
Now, we adopt the Floquet theory to solve Eq. (2).
First, we focus on the time-evolution superoperator that
describes the evolution from an initial time t0to a future
time t:
U(t, t0) =TeRt
t0L(t′)dt′
. (3)
Since L(t) is periodic with period T, we can split the
entire time interval from t0totast−t0=mT+τ,
where m∈N0and the residual time τ∈[0, T). Then,
U(t, t0) =TeRt0+τ
t0L(t′)dt′(UF)m=U(t0+τ, t0)(UF)m,
(4)
where the Floquet-Lindblad evolution superoperator is de-
fined as UF≡ U(t0+T, t0) and describes the stroboscopic
evolution of the system. Next, we define the eigenoper-
ators ρjofUFand denote the corresponding eigenvalue
aseλjT:
UFρj=eλjTρj, (5)
resembling its counterpart UF|uj⟩=e−iϵjT|uj⟩in non-
dissipative Floquet systems. Similarly to the quasi-energy
ϵjin that case, the imaginary part of the λjis determined
only modulo 2 π/T. It is worth emphasizing that these
eigenoperators ρjare not guaranteed to be physical den-
sity operators, and that all the eigenoperators may not
form a complete basis of the Liouville space because UF
is not always diagonalizable.
It is straightforward to show (see Appendix C) that
the time evolution of ρj(t) can be written as a periodic
function ϱj(t) modulated by an envelope function:
ρj(t)≡ U(t, t0)ρj=eλj(mT+τ)ϱj(t0+τ), (6)
where ϱj(t0+τ)≡ U(t0+τ, t0)e−λjτρjis constructed
such that that ϱj(t+T) =ϱj(t) and is called a Floquet-
Lindblad eigenmode . Thus, the physical significance of
the eigenoperator ρjis that, if the system begins to evolve
from an eigenoperator ρj=ϱj(t0) at time t0, it returns
to itself up to a factor eλjTafter one period. Amongst
all the eigenoperators, those with eigenvalues |eλjT|= 1
are special as these at most accumulate a phase factor
at the end of each period i.e., these are non-decaying
eigenmodes and are referred to as “coherent Floquet
modes”. Moreover, the eigenoperator(s) ρ0with eigen-
value eλ0T= 1 evolves with period Tbecause λ0= 0 im-
plies ρ0(t) =ϱ0(t) by Eq. (6). Such periodically evolving
states with period Tare referred to as Floquet-Lindblad
steady states [38, 44, 45]. If such an eigenoperator ρ0is
physical, its evolution ρ0(t) is a NESS of the system. In
general, the NESS for the Floquet-Lindblad equation is
defined as any physical density operator ˜ ρ(t) that solves
the equation and obeys UF˜ρ(t0) = ˜ρ(t0).
In the next Section, we list and prove the spectral prop-
erties of the Floquet-Lindblad evolution superoperator
UF, showing that:
1. For any Floquet-Lindblad equation, there exists a
subspace of the Liouville space spanned by eigen-
operators ρjofUFwith eigenvalues |eλjT|= 1.Generic operators ρ(t0) initialized in this non-
decaying subspace do not decay during their time-
evolution, while other generic operators initialized
outside the non-decaying subspace will eventually
decay out. Moreover, the non-decaying subspace
depends on the choice t0inUF=U(t0+T, t0),
indicating that a non-decaying solution ρ(t) is only
guaranteed to remain within the non-decaying sub-
space at the end of periods i.e., when t=t0+mT.
2.UFalways has a unit eigenvalue eλ0T= 1,
whose corresponding eigenoperators ρ(1)
0, ..., ρ(n)
0
are Floquet-Lindblad steady states. The space
spanned by them, called the steady space , is a sub-
space of the non-decaying subspace and depends on
the choice t0as well. Moreover, there is always at
least one eigenoperator in the steady space that is
physical, corresponding to the NESS of the system.
3. Given any physical initial state ρ(t0), it always has
non-vanishing support on the non-decaying sub-
space i.e., it must have a non-decaying component
which lives in the non-decaying subspace. The time-
evolution of this non-decaying component is a linear
combination of time-evolved eigenoperators ρj(t)
with eigenvalues of |eλjT|= 1, which always in-
clude a physical NESS ρ0(t).
It is important to distinguish between the non-
decaying component of an initial state and that of
a time-dependent solution. The former is a linear
combination of ρjwith eigenvalues of |eλjT|= 1
and thus lies in the non-decaying subspace, while
the latter is a linear combination of the evolved
eigenoperators ρj(t) or eigenmodes ϱj(t), which is
not guaranteed to be in the non-decaying subspace
unless at the end of each period. The properties
of the non-decaying component of an initial state
were previously discussed from the perspective of
Floquet dynamical symmetries (FDS) in Ref. [45].
4. In the special case that eλ0T= 1 is non-degenerate,
the corresponding eigenoperator ρ0is guaranteed
to be physical and its time evolution ρ0(t) is the
unique physical NESS of the system. In other
words, this ρ0is a component of the non-decaying
part of any physical initial state.
5. If the non-decaying part of an initial state ρ(t0)
is entirely in the steady space, it shows a periodic
evolution with period Tafter the transient decays
out, i.e. it will gradually converge to a NESS. If
the non-decaying part of ρ(t0) is not entirely in the
steady space, it may evolve with a period longer
than Tafter the transient part decays out, which
means it does not converge to a NESS by definition.4

III. PROPERTIES OF FLOQUET-LINDBLAD
EIGEN SOLUTIONS
In this section, we present and mathematically prove
the properties of the spectrum {(eλjT, ρj)}of the
Floquet-Lindblad evolution operator UF. We only as-
sume that the Liouville superoperator is time-periodic
L(t) =L(t+T) and takes the Lindblad form (see Eq.
(2)), where the positive damping rates Γ µ>0 ensures
the CPTP nature of the dynamical map. The spectral
properties of the Floquet-Lindblad equations are similar
to those of the time-independent Lindblad equations [24],
which are reviewed in Appendix A.
The first three properties are closely related to the dis-
tribution of eigenvalues eλjT, schematically illustrated in
Fig. 1.
Theorem 1. If(eλjT, ρj)is an eigensolution, so is
(eλ∗
jT, ρ†
j).
Proof. This comes from the fact that
eλ∗
jTρ†
j= (eλjTρj)†= (UFρj)†=UFρ†
j. (7)
To prove the last equality, notice that UFis a prod-
uct of piecewise-constant evolution with small enough
time interval ∆ t:UF=QT/∆t
s=1(I+L(t0+s∆t)∆t). By
the definition of L, we know ( Lρj)†=Lρ†
j, implying
(UFρj)†=UFρ†
j.
Corollary 1. If the eigenvalue eλjTis real and non-
degenerate, then ρj=ρ†
j. Likewise, if eλjTis not real,
then ρj̸=ρ†
j. Inversely, if ρj=ρ†
j, then eλjTis real.Theorem 2. IfeλjT̸= 1, then Trρj= 0.
Proof. Due to the trace-preserving property, eλjTTrρj=
Tr(UFρj) = Tr ρj. Thus Tr ρj= 0.
Theorem 3. For any eigenvalue eλjT, its modulus
|eλjT| ≤1.
Proof. We prove this by contradiction and construction.
Assume there exists an eigenvalue |eλjT|>1 and its cor-
responding eigenoperator is ρj. We can construct a Her-
mitian and positive semi-definite density operator as the
initial state of the evolution:
ρ(t0) =I+ε(ρj+ρ†
j), (8)
where ε≪1 is a sufficiently small real number so that
ρ(t0) remains positive semi-definite. We denote Tr I=D.
Here we assume ρj+ρ†
j̸= 0. If it is zero, we then replace
it with i(ρj−ρ†
j). Now, we evolve ρ(t0) form≫1 periods:
ρ(t0+mT) =Um
FI+ε(eλjmTρj+eλ∗
jmTρ†
j).(9)
Since the evolution is completely positive and Iis positive
semi-definite, Um
FIis also positive semi-definite, i.e., for
any normalized |ψ⟩ ∈H,⟨ψ|Um
FI|ψ⟩is non-negative.
Also, by the trace-preserving property, we know that
Tr [Um
FI] =Dand then ⟨ψ|Um
FI|ψ⟩is bounded by D.
As|eλjT|>1, we can find an integer mlarge enough
and a vector |ψ⟩such that
⟨ψ|ε(eλjmTρj+eλ∗
jmTρ†
j)|ψ⟩> D.
Then⟨ψ|ρ(t0+mT)|ψ⟩> D or⟨ψ|ρ(t0+mT)|ψ⟩<0,
which contradicts that ρ(t0+mT) must remain positive
semi-definite under the evolution [5, 6, 20].
Now, in the simple situation where UFis diagonaliz-
able, we readily see that any state in the Liouville space is
a linear combination of eigenoperators ρjsince the latter
form a complete basis. Thus, an arbitrary state at initial
time ρ(t0) =P
jajρjevolving to time t=t0+mT+τ
becomes
ρ(t) =X
jajρj(t) =X
jajeλj(t−t0)ϱj(t),(10)
where ϱj(t) =ϱj(t0+τ) are the time-periodic Floquet-
Lindblad eigenmodes. It is apparent that at a large
enough time t, all the components with |eλjT|<1 will
eventually decay out, leaving only the non-decaying com-
ponents with eigenvalues |eλjT|= 1. This aligns with our
physical intuition that a solution of a Floquet-Lindblad
equation usually oscillates while decaying, and may leave
a non-decaying component after the transient part dies
out. However, as the evolution is not unitary, the diag-
onalizability of UFis not guaranteed. We need further
investigation of the spectral properties to get a compre-
hensive understanding of the driven-dissipative dynam-
ics.5
Therefore, we now focus on the cases where UFcannot
be completely diagonalized. In other words, there exists
at least one deficient eigenvalue eλjTwhose geometric
multiplicity kis smaller than its algebraic multiplicity
(i.e., degeneracy) n, which is also known as an exceptional
point. Each deficient eigenvalue with degeneracy nis as-
sociated with an n-dimensional subspace Vλjof the Liou-
ville space spanned by its eigenoperators and some other
operators, such that UFVλj⊆Vλj, leading to the defini-
tion:UFλj≡ UF|Vλji.e, the Floquet evolution operator
acting on Vλj. Then, one can properly choose the basis of
Vλj, including the keigenoperators, to form a transition
superoperator Pλj=
ρ(1)
j... ρ(k)
jp(1)
j... p(n−k)
j
,
such that P−1
λjUFλjPλj=JFλjandJFλjis the Jordan
normal form. In Theorem 2 we proved that ρ(1)
j, ..., ρ(k)
j
are traceless if eλjT̸= 1. Now we want to show that
p(1)
j, ..., p(n−k)
j are also traceless.
Theorem 4. For every deficient eigenvalue eλjT̸= 1,
all the operators ρ(1)
j, ..., ρ(k)
j, p(1)
j, ..., p(n−k)
j spanning the
transition superoperator Pλjare traceless.
Proof. Since there are k−1 eigenoperators that only con-
tribute to a diagonal block of JFλj, we can separate them
from the basis spanning Vλjand we only need to prove
the case k= 1. Supposing that λjisn-fold degenerate,
we can represent UFλjin matrix form:
P−1
λjUFλjPλj=

......1
0eλjT
,
Pλj=
ρ(1)
jp(1)
j... p(n−1)
j
.(11)
Theorem 2 tells us Tr ρ(1)
j= 0; then we can use the trace-
preserving property to show that
Tr(UFλjp(1)
j) = Tr ρ(1)
j+eλjTTrp(1)
j= Trp(1)
j=⇒Trp(1)
j= 0.
(12)
Likewise, Tr p(2)
j=...= Trp(n−1)
j = 0 can be proved by
continuously applying induction.
Theorem 5. UFmust have at least one eigenoperator ρ0
such that eλ0T= 1while Trρ0̸= 0. This ρ0, by definition,
is a Floquet-Lindblad steady state of the system such that
UFρ0=ρ0.
Proof. IfUFis assumed to be diagonalizable, the proof is
trivial. This is because when all the eigenoperators form a
complete basis of the Liouville space H⊗H∗, there is at
least one eigenoperator that is traceful. Given that The-
orem 2 shows that eigenstates with nonunit eigenvalues
are traceless, we conclude that the traceful eigenoperator
has a unit eigenvalue.Furthermore, without assuming UFis diagonalizable,
we can also show the existence of a unit eigenvalue and
a corresponding traceful eigenoperator. As mentioned in
the proof of Theorem 4, in the situation where UFis not
diagonalizable, the operators spanning all the transition
superoperators Pλj’s still form a complete basis of the
Liouville space. Therefore, there must be at least one of
them that is traceful. Since Theorem 4 already shows
that all the operators spanning Vλjwith eλjT̸= 1 are
traceless and there must be at least one traceful operator
in the Liouville space, there is at least one operator in
Vλ0subspace such that eλ0T= 1. As a consequence, we
prove the existence of eλ0T= 1, see Fig. 1.
We are now going to prove that at least one eigenop-
erator of eλ0T= 1 is traceful. There are two cases:
1. IfUFλ0is diagonalizable in the eλ0T= 1 subspace
Vλ0, then all the operators spanning Vλ0are eigenoper-
ators of eigenvalue eλ0T= 1. Therefore, at least one of
them has non-zero trace.
2. The other possibility is that UFλ0is not diagonaliz-
able. However, we will show in Theorem 6 that UFλ0is
always diagonalizable.
Theorem 6. Ifeλ0T= 1has degeneracy n, then there
exist nindependent corresponding eigenoperators i.e.,
UFλ0is diagonalizable.
Proof. We will prove this by contradiction, extending the
logic in Ref. [24] that proved a similar property for time-
independent L. Supposing that UFλ0is not diagonaliz-
able, we can always put the non-diagonalizable part into
Jordan normal form:

where Nis the upper triangle part of the Jordan normal
form, and is a nilpotent matrix with Nn−1= 0. Imagine
that we evolve the system from t0tot0+mT(m > n )
by applying UFbymtimes; then, in the Vλ0subspace6

is the binomial coefficient and we
have used q=eλ0Tfor simplicity. Since q= 1, the above
expression will clearly cause the dynamics to diverge in
large m, showing a contradiction.
We can relax the condition eλT= 1 to |eλT|= 1 and
still show UFλis diagonalizable. The proof is similar.
Theorem 7. If|eλjT|= 1,UFλjis diagonalizable.
In summary, despite the non-diagonalizability of UF,
we still have a complete basis of the Liouville space
consisting of eigenoperators ρj’s and non-eigen opera-
torspj’s that correspond to each eigenvalue eλjT. For
any|eλjT|<1, by noticing that for 1 < s≤n−k,
UFp(s)
j=p(s−1)
j +eλjTp(s)
jandUFp(1)
j=ρ(k)
j+eλjTp(1)
j,
we realize that a linear combination of ρj’s and pj’s will
gradually decay out at a large time t, representing a tran-
sient solution.
Theorems 6 and 7 ensure that the subspaces associ-
ated with |eλjT|= 1 are spanned by eigenoperators only,
which directly leads to the fact that the non-decaying
component of any initial state is a linear combination of
eigenoperators of UF. We will call the space spanned by
all these eigenoperators as the non-decaying subspace .
Theorems 4 and 5 show that all the basis operators are
traceless except for the eigenoperators with eigenvalues
that equal 1. Therefore, for any physical initial state, it
has to include a traceful eigenoperator ρ0in order to be
traceful itself, and thus a physical initial state must have
some non-decaying component.
Next, we are going to prove that there is at least one
physical eigenoperator in Vλ0=0. In the situation where
eλ0T= 1 is non-degenerate, the corresponding unique
eigenoperator ρ0gives the physical NESS ρ0(t) for any
physical initial states.
Theorem 8. Ifeλ0T= 1is non-degenerate, the corre-
sponding ρ0is Hermitian, semi-definite, and traceful, in-
dicating that ρ0is physical after normalizing to Trρ0= 1.
Proof. Theorems 2 and 5 already prove that ρ0is Hermi-
tian and traceful. Thus, we only need to prove its semi-definiteness here, or equivalently, prove its positive semi-
definiteness after normalizing to Tr ρ0= 1.
We prove this by construction: Take a physical density
operator as the initial state, and let it evolve in time.
Since the operators spanning Pform a complete basis,
the initial state can be expressed as a linear combina-
tion of them. At late times t, all the terms initially in
the|eλjT|<1 subspaces decay out due to the eλjmTfac-
tor in Eq. (6), leaving only the terms in the |eλjT|= 1
subspaces, i.e., the non-decaying subspace.
Theorems 6 and 7 show that the non-decaying sub-
space is fully spanned by eigenoperators of UF. There-
fore, after evolving for a large number of periods, at
t=mT+t0, the kate-timephysical state (which is her-
mitian) can be expressed as
ρ(t) =a0ρ0+X
j:|eλjT|=1,argeλjT̸=0(eλjmTajρj+h.c.),(15)
where the non-zero constant a0∈R. The completely pos-
itive nature of the dynamical evolution ensures that the
above remains positive semi-definite, which means that
∀|ψ⟩ ∈H,⟨ψ|ρ(t)|ψ⟩ ≥0. (16)
Then, denoting ⟨ψ|ρj|ψ⟩=⟨ρj⟩, we have
a0⟨ρ0⟩+X
j:|eλjT|=1,argeλjT̸=0(eλjmTaj⟨ρj⟩+c.c.)≥0.
(17)
The terms in the summation must take the form
˜ajcos(|λj|mT+ϕj),˜aj∈R, and because λjis purely
imaginary, we have
a0⟨ρ0⟩+X
j:|eλjT|=1,argeλjT̸=0˜ajcos(|λj|mT+ϕj)≥0.
(18)
It can be shown that the average of the time-dependent
part over enough many periods is zero:
1
MMX
m=1
X
j:|eλjT|=1,argeλjT̸=0˜ajcos(|λj|mT+ϕj)
= 0,
(19)
where M≫1. This result indicates that the time-
dependent part is either constantly zero or oscillating
between positive and negative. Hence, a0⟨ρ0⟩should be
non-negative to keep the entire equation non-negative.
Therefore, ⟨ψ|ρ0|ψ⟩is either non-positive or non-
negative (depending on its normalization) for all |ψ⟩ ∈ H .
Then, ρ0is semi-definite. After normalizing to Tr ρ0= 1,
it is positive semi-definite.
Theorem 9. Regardless of the degeneracy of eλ0T= 1,
there exists at least one physical steady state which is an
eigenoperator of UFwith eigenvalue eλ0T= 1.
Proof. The proof is similar to that of Theorem 8, where
a0ρ0in Eq. (15) is replaced by a linear combination of
the degenerate eigenoperators with eigenvalue of 1. The
rest of the proof follows as before.7

To conclude this Section, we emphasize that a Floquet-
Lindblad equation always has at least one Floquet-
Lindblad steady-state solution that is physical. More-
over, we point out that even if there does not exist a
“Floquet-Liouville superoperator” LFin Lindblad form,
which resembles the Floquet Hamiltonian HFin closed
Floquet systems, or even if the Floquet-Lindblad evolu-
tion operator UFis not fully diagonalizable, UFis always
diagonalizable in the non-decaying subspace so that the
non-decaying component of any initial state ρ(t0) can be
expressed as a linear combination of eigenstates ρj’s of
UFwhose eigenvalues have modulus |eλjT|= 1. We also
note that starting from any physical initial state, there is
always a non-decaying component in the evolution, which
is a linear combination of the time-evolved eigenopera-
torsρj(t) with |eλjT|= 1, and there is always a physi-
cal NESS ρ0(t) in this combination. The spectral proper-
ties of Floquet-Lindblad equations and time-independent
Lindblad equations are concisely summarized in Table I
for comparison.
IV. NONLINEAR OPTICAL EFFECTS IN
SOLIDS
In this Section, we apply the Floquet-Lindblad formal-
ism to study the nonlinear optical responses of a sim-
ple insulating solid-state system described by two Bloch
bands (a valence band and a conduction band), and com-
pare the results with those from a previous study [40] on a
similar problem that used the Keldysh Greens’ functions
combined with Floquet theory [46–49]. This example il-
lustrates that the Floquet-Lindblad method can describe
coupling the system with baths at arbitrary tempera-
tures, can go beyond the rotating-wave approximation
(RWA) easily, and allows us to obtain linear effects in a
non-perturbative manner. Specifically, we will investigate
the electric current J(t) in the insulating solid induced
by the periodic driving from an external electromagnetic
field. Moreover, we will focus on the current response in
the steady state.
First, we write the Hamiltonian of the system that isdriven by an external periodic drive. Among the many
energy bands in an insulator, we focus on the two bands
close to the Fermi surface: a fully occupied valance
band and an empty conduction band that is involved in
the transition induced by a monochromatic electric field
(light): E(t) =Ee−iΩt+E∗eiΩt, see Fig. 2. The many-
body Hamiltonian of the solid system in the absence of
the driving field and within the subspace of these two
energy bands is
H0=X

k,mck,m, (20)
where c†
k,mdenotes the creation operator of the electron
at quasi-momentum kand energy band m. The band
indices m= 1,2 respectively denote the valence and con-
duction bands, each of which having its own energy dis-
persion ϵ0
1,2(k). The coupling between the electrons and
the light field introduces a periodically time-dependent
term in the Hamiltonian [40]:
H(t) =H0+A(t)V0, (21)
where V0=P
k,m,nc†

atorin the absence of the driving field (see Appendix F),
andA(t) =−iAe−iΩt+iA∗eiΩtis the vector potential
corresponding to the driving field: E(t) =−∂A(t)
∂t, such
that its amplitude is A=E/Ω.
Since the form of the Hamiltonian (21) ensures that
quasi-momentum kis conserved during evolution, we can
treat each ksector as an independent two-level single-
particle quantum system to be dealt with separately. In
the basis spanned by single particle states {|k,1⟩,|k,2⟩},
the Hamiltonian of the two-level system is represented by
a 2-by-2 matrix:
h(k, t) =
ϵ0
1(k) +A(t)v0
11(k) A(t)v0
12(k)
A(t)v0
21(k) ϵ0
2(k) +A(t)v0
22(k)
.
(22)
We now apply the Shirley-Floquet formalism [50] (dis-
cussed in Appendix D and E), which expands the time
dependent Hamiltonian (22) into an infinite dimensional
matrix consisting the Fourier coefficients of h(k, t). For
simplicity of the demonstration, we will work within
the RWA by only keeping a 2-by-2 block of the entire
Shirley-Floquet Hamiltonian in each sector k[40] (see
Appendix F for more details):

We will use real parameters ϵandd= (dx, dy, dz) to
denote them for simplicity.
Then, we couple the system with a photonic heat bath
and write down the matrix equation for solving Floquet-8

where L1=σ+andL2=σ−represent the emis-
sion/absorption of energy to/from the heat bath, re-
spectively. At any quasi-momentum k, the corresponding
damping rates Γ 1,2are controlled by the average photon
number Nin the heat bath [4]:
Γ1=γ0(N+ 1),Γ2=γ0N, (25)
where γ0is a positive coupling constant given by the
microscopic interaction between the photons in the bath
and the electrons in the solid. The average number Nof
photons at a certain energy in the bath is determined by
the bath temperature via the Planck distribution [4]:
N=1
exp(βε)−1, (26)
where ε=ϵ0
2(k)−ϵ0
1(k) is the photon energy and βis the
inverse temperature of the heat bath. As the bath tem-
perature is encoded in Γ 1and Γ 2, the Floquet-Lindblad
method is capable of discussing the system coupled to
heat baths at arbitrary temperatures. In this setup, the
emission rate Γ 1is always larger than the absorption
rate Γ 2. Specifically, at zero temperature, N= 0 so that
Γ2= 0 and Γ 1=γ0is positive.
Next, we solve the Floquet-Lindblad steady state by
setting the eigenvalue λj= 0. To solve Eq. (24), we pa-
rameterize the steady-state density matrix as ρRWA
ss(k) =
ϱRWA
0(k) =1
2(I+⟨σ⟩RWA
ss·σ), imposing the Hermitian
and unit trace conditions. Then, (suppressing the kin-
dex) Eq. (24) becomes

With the NESS solution ρss(t), we can calculate the
expectation values of any physical observable Oin the
steady state by ⟨O⟩ss(t) = Tr[ Oρss(t)]. In the present
scenario, the physical quantity of interest is the current,
whose second-order response to the periodic driving po-
tential contains two parts: direct current (DC) and sec-
ond harmonic generation (SHG), and their steady-state
values are contributed to by every momentum sector k.
The DC part is also called the “shift current” and the cor-
responding current operator in a particular momentum
sector kcan be expressed by real parameters b0, bx, by, bz
as (see Appendix F)
vRWA(k)≡b0I+b·σ=
b0+bzbx−iby

As a result, the steady-state value of the DC response

byρRWA

JDC(k) = Tr 

(30)
The total DC response is a summation of contributions
coming from all the momentum sectors. If we set the tem-
perature to zero by taking Γ 2= 0, then γ=γ0= Γ1, and
we find that the above result is qualitatively similar to the
result obtained in Ref. [40] using Keldysh Greens’ func-
tions. We attribute the quantitative difference between
the two results to the nature of the bath: in Ref. [40], the
system was coupled to a fermionic bath, while our cou-
pling is to a bosonic (photonic) bath. We evaluate the
SHG part of the response in Appendix F.
The above demonstrative calculation is in the RWA as
we only keep the two lowest-frequency components in the
entire Fourier series, reducing the Shirley-Floquet Hamil-
tonian at each momentum sector kto a 2-by-2 matrix9
(23). To go beyond RWA in numerical calculations, one
can simply include more terms with higher frequencies in
the infinite dimensional Shirly-Floquet Hamiltonian ma-
trix, getting nonlinear optical responses up to a higher
order all at once.
V. CONCLUSION
In this article, we have discussed the spectral features
of the Floquet-Lindblad evolution superoperator UFand
their consequences on the resulting NESS. Further, we
have illustrated how this formalism allows us to obtain
nonlinear optical effects by considering a simple model of
an insulating solid and contrasting our results with those
obtained prior through Keldysh techniques. The Floquet-
Lindblad formalism is thus well suited for describing the
non-equilibrium physics of quantum many-body systems
as well as that of nonlinear optical systems. In the future,
it would be interesting to verify the regimes of validity of
perturbative methods (such as the Magnus or van Vleck
high-frequency expansions [38, 44]) by comparing them
with the Floquet-Lindblad formalism. It would also be
interesting to extend the Floquet formalism to the case
of non-Markovian but still completely positive dynamics,
which goes beyond the Born-Markov approximation we
have considered here.

Appendix A: Spectral properties of
time-independent Lindbladian
In this Appendix, we write down (and sketch proofs
for) the properties of the eigensolutions of a time-
independent Liouville superoperator. The CPTP nature
of the dynamical map will play a key role in establishing
several of the following lemmas. The eigenvalue equation
takes the form:
Lρj=λjρj, (A1)where Lis the Lindbladian superoperator, λjis the (gen-
erally comples) eigenvalue, and ρjis the corresponding
eigenoperator, which is not assumed to be a physical den-
sity matrix (unit trace, Hermitian, and positive definite).
If we set ρjas the initial state of the dynamics (where
we set the initial time t0= 0 without loss of generality),
the state of the system at a later time tis given by
ρj(t)≡eLtρj=eλjtρj, (A2)
such that Re[ λj] governs the decay of ρjand Im[ λj] makes
it oscillate.
Lemma 1. For any eigenvalue λj, its real part Re[λj]≤
0. (The real part of the eigenvalues is responsible for the
relaxation to the steady state.)
Lemma 2. If(λj, ρj)is a pair of eigensolutions, so is
(λ∗
j, ρ†
j).
Proof. (Lρj)†=Lρ†
j= (λjρj)†=λ∗
jρ†
j
Lemma 3. Ifλjis real and non-degenerate, then ρj=
ρ†
j. Likewise, if λjis not real, then ρj̸=ρ†
j. Inversely, if
ρj=ρ†
j, then λjis real.
Lemma 4. Ifλj̸= 0, then Trρj= 0.
Proof. Due to the trace-preserving property, 0 =
∂t(Trρj) = Tr( Lρj) =λjTrρj.
Lemma 5. In the situation where Lis not diagonaliz-
able, for an eigenvalue λj̸= 0 whose geometric multi-
plicity is smaller than its algebraic multiplicity, all the
(linearly independent) “column vectors” of the transi-
tion operator Passociated with λjare traceless, where
P−1LP=JandJis the Jordan normal form.
Proof. Without losing generality, we take an example of
a 3-fold degenerate eigenvalue λjwhose geometric multi-
plicity is 1. Then, in this subspace we can explicitly write
Lλjin matrix form:
Lλj=Pλj
λj1 0
0λj1
0 0 λj
P−1
λj,Pλj= ρjp1p2
.
(A3)
Lemma 4 tells us that Tr ρj= 0. Then, we can show:
∂t(Trp1) = Tr( Lλjp1) = Tr ρj+λjTrp1= 0 =⇒Trp1= 0.
(A4)
Likewise, Tr p2= 0 can be proved by continued induction.
Lemma 6. Lmust have at least one eigenstate ρ0such
thatλ0= 0while Trρj̸= 0. This ρ0, by definition, is a
steady state of the system such that ∂tρ0=Lρ0= 0.
Proof. This can be shown straightforwardly with Las-
sumed to be diagonalizable (because its eigenstates form
a complete basis of the operator space H ⊗ H∗) and10
Lemma 4 shows that eigenstates with non-zero eigenval-
ues are traceless.
Furthermore, without assuming diagonalizability, we
can also show the existence of a zero eigenvalue and a
corresponding traceful eigenoperator. As mentioned in
the proof of Lemma 5, in the situation where Lis not di-
agonalizable, the “column vectors” of the transition oper-
atorPstill form a complete basis of the operator space.
Therefore, there must be at least one “column vector”
with non-zero trace. Lemma 5 then already shows that
all the “column vectors” in the λj̸= 0 subspaces are
traceless; thus, there is at least one traceful basis state
in the λ0= 0 subspace. As a consequence, we prove the
existence of λ0= 0.
We are now going to prove that at least one eigenstate
ofλ0= 0 is traceful, case by case:
1. Ifλ0is non-degenerate, the corresponding eigenstate
ρ0must have non-zero trace.
2. If in the λ0subspace Lλ0is diagonalizable, then all
the corresponding “column vectors” in Pare eigenstates
ofλ0. The above argument of the completeness of the
basis leads to the result that at least one of them has a
non-zero trace.
3. The only remaining case is that Lλ0is not diago-
nalizable. However, we will next show that Lλ0is always
diagonalizable.
Lemma 7. Ifλ0= 0has degeneracy n, then there exist
nindependent corresponding eigenvectors [24]. Namely,
Lλ0is diagonalizable.
Proof. We will prove this by contradiction. Supposing
thatLλ0is not diagonalizable, we can always put the
non-diagonalizable part into its Jordan normal form:
Lλ0=Pλ0
λ01
0λ01
0......
......1
0λ0
P−1
λ0. (A5)
Then we can express the time evolution operator as:
eLλ0t=Pλ0eλ0t

P−1
λ0.
(A6)
Since λ0= 0, the above expression will clearly cause the
dynamics to diverge at large t, which gives a contradic-
tion.
Lemma 8. The property stated in Lemma 7 also applies
to purely imaginary eigenvalues Re[λj] = 0 . (Proof is
similar.)Lemma 9. Ifλ0= 0is non-degenerate, the correspond-
ingρ0is Hermitian, semi-definite, and traceful, indicat-
ing that ρ0is physical after normalizing to Trρ0= 1.
Proof. Lemma 3 and 6 already showed that ρ0is Hermi-
tian and traceful. Thus, we only need to prove its semi-
definiteness here, or equivalently, prove positive semi-
definite after normalizing to Tr ρ0= 1.
We prove this by construction. We take a physical den-
sity operator as the initial state and let it evolve. Since
the “column vectors” of Pform a complete basis, the
initial state can be expressed as a linear combination
of them. At a sufficiently long time t, all terms in the
Re[λj]<0 subspaces decay due to the eλjtfactor in the
evolution operator eLλjt, leaving only the components in
the Re[ λj] = 0 subspaces.
Then, Lemma 7 and 8 show that these subspaces are
fully expanded by the corresponding eigenvectors of L.
Therefore, at large time t, the evolved physical state,
which is Hermitian, can be expressed as
ρ(t) =a0ρ0+X
j:Re[λj]=0,Im[λj]≡ωj̸=0(eiωjtajρj+h.c.), a0∈R.
(A7)
The CP (completely positive) nature of the dynamical
evolution ensures that the above remains positive semi-
definite, which means that
∀|ψ⟩ ∈H,⟨ψ|ρ(t)|ψ⟩ ≥0. (A8)
Then, denoting ⟨ψ|ρj|ψ⟩=⟨ρj⟩, we have
a0⟨ρ0⟩+X
j:Re[λj]=0,Im[λj]≡ωj̸=0(eiωjtaj⟨ρj⟩+c.c.)≥0.
(A9)
The terms in the summation must take the form
˜ajcos(ωjt+ϕj),˜aj∈R, so that we have
a0⟨ρ0⟩+X
j:Re[λj]=0,Im[λj]≡ωj̸=0˜ajcos(ωjt+ϕj)≥0.
(A10)
Now we see that the summation is over a finite set of
sinusoidal functions. This function can be shown to be
“almost periodic” and has infinitely many zeros. Here,
we only use the fact that its long-time average is zero,
which indicates that it is sometimes positive and some-
times negative, unless all the aj’s are zero (in that case
the summation is zero). As a result, the first term a0⟨ρ0⟩
should be non-negative to keep the entire equation non-
negative.
Therefore, ⟨ψ|ρ0|ψ⟩is either non-positive or non-
negative for all |ψ⟩ ∈H, and thus ρ0is semi-definite.
After normalizing to Tr ρ0= 1, it is clearly positive semi-
definite.
Lemma 10. Regardless of whether λ0= 0 is degener-
ate or non-degenerate, there exists at least one physical
steady state which is an eigenoperator of λ0.11
Proof. This is similar to the previous proof. Starting from
a physical initial state and evolving for a long enough
time such that all transients have decayed, the late-time
state is
ρ(t) =X
n(a(n)
0ρ(n)
0+a∗(n)
0ρ(n)†
0)
+X
j:Re[λj]=0,Im[λj]̸=0(eiωjtajρj+h.c.),(A11)
where ρ(n)
0are the eigenoperators with eigenvalue λ0.
Now, we see that the first term is Hermitian and must
have a unit trace, since the second term has vanishing
trace. A similar argument as one used in the proof of
Lemma 9 shows that the expectation value of the first
term under any state |ψ⟩ ∈Hin the Hilbert space is
positive. Now we have shown that the first term is physi-
cal. Noticing that the first term is just a steady state, we
conclude that there is at least one physical steady state
of the system.
In summary, the non-decaying part of the time-evolved
state ρ(t) from any arbitrary initial state ρ(t0) can be
expressed as a linear combination of eigenstates ρjofL
whose eigenvalues have zero real parts Re[ λj] = 0.
Appendix B: Floquet theory for closed quantum
systems
Here, we review the Floquet theory for closed quan-
tum systems evolving under a time-periodic Hamiltonian.
Consider the time-dependent Schr¨ odinger equation:
id
dt|ψ⟩=H(t)|ψ⟩, (B1)
where the Hamiltonian H(t) =H(t+T) is periodic in
time. It is well known that the whole dynamics is cap-
tured by the unitary time-evolution operator
U(t, t0) =Te−iRt
t0H(t)dt, (B2)
and the discrete time-translational invariance lets us
break the entire time interval into several periods plus
a residual time: t−t0=mT+τ,m∈N0andτ∈[0, T).
As a result:
U(t, t0) =U(t0+τ, t0)(U(t0+T, t0))m. (B3)
The evolution operator over one period is defined as the
Floquet evolution operator :
UF≡U(t0+T, t0) =Te−iRt0+T
t0H(t)dt, (B4)
which is usually written in the form UF≡e−iHFT, where
HFis a Hermitian operator referred to as the “Floquet
Hamiltonian”. HFis not a Hamiltonian in any physical
sense since it is generically non-local. In addition, it is notunambiguously defined due to the indeterminacy modulo
2πon its eigenvalues.
Since UFis unitary, its diagonalization provides a com-
plete and orthonormal basis {|uj⟩}of the Hilbert space
H:
UF|uj⟩=e−iϵjT|uj⟩ (B5)
where the “quasi-energies” ϵjare determined only mod-
ulo Ω = 2 π/T. Note that these |uj⟩’s are time-
independent . Clearly, these eigenstates are also the eigen-
states of HF:
HF|uj⟩=ϵj|uj⟩. (B6)
Calculating the time-evolution of these eigenstates
|uj⟩, we get
U(t, t0)|uj⟩=U(t0+τ, t0)(UF)m|uj⟩
=e−iϵjmTU(t0+τ, t0)|uj⟩,(B7)
which can be seen as an envelope eiϵjmTmodulating a
periodic function U(t0+τ, t0)|uj⟩. This is not satisfactory
since both of them are not continuous at the end of each
period τ=T, so we fix it by introducing an extra factor
ofe−iϵjτinto the envelope:
U(t, t0)|uj⟩=e−iϵj(mT+τ)U(t0+τ, t0)eiϵjτ|uj⟩
=e−iϵj(t−t0)|uj(t)⟩.(B8)
The periodic part is defined as Floquet (eigen)modes:
|uj(t)⟩=U(t0+τ, t0)eiϵjτ|uj⟩, or in a neater but equiv-
alent way: |uj(t)⟩=U(t, t0)eiϵj(t−t0)|uj⟩, which are gen-
eralizations of energy eigenstates in time-independent
problems. We can construct general solutions of the time-
dependent Schr¨ odinger equation by linearly combining
the Floquet modes:
|ψ(t)⟩=X
jaje−iϵj(t−t0)|uj(t)⟩. (B9)
Appendix C: Time-evolution of Floquet-Lindblad
eigenmodes
In this Appendix, we derive the time evolution of the
Floquet-Lindblad eigenoperators ρj(t). Taking ρjas the
initial state and applying the time evolution operator to
it, we get
U(t, t0)ρj=U(t0+τ, t0)(UF)mρj=eλjmTU(t0+τ, t0)ρj.
(C1)
It is clear that the evolution contains a periodic part
U(t0+τ, t0)ρjwith an envelope eλjmT. However, we are
still one step away from the concept of Floquet mode,
because both the periodic part and the envelope are not
continuous at the end of each period τ=T. To resolve
this, we rewrite it in the form:
U(t, t0)ρj=eλjmTU(t0+τ, t0)eλjτe−λjτρj
=eλj(mT+τ)U(t0+τ, t0)e−λjτρj.(C2)12
Re-written thusly, the envelope eλj(mT+τ)=eλj(t−t0)is
manifestly continuous, while the remainder
ϱj(t0+τ)≡ U(t0+τ, t0)e−λjτρj, ϱj(t+T) =ϱj(t),(C3)
is also now continuous and remains periodic, similarly to
the Floquet eigenmodes in non-dissipative Floquet sys-
tems. We can write ϱj(t) in another form:
ϱj(t) =e−λj(t−t0)U(t, t0)ρj. (C4)
We refer to ϱj(t) as the Floquet-Lindblad eigenmodes.
Please note that ϱj(t) is not ρjevolved to time t:ϱj(t)̸=
U(t, t0)ρj.
Appendix D: Shirley-Floquet Formalism and the
Extended Hilbert Space
Generically, it is not practical to directly obtain an ex-
act expression for UF. Therefore, we need a more accessi-
ble way for obtaining the Floquet modes (as functions of
time). In this Appendix, we discuss one such approach for
obtaining the stroboscopic evolution operator in closed
quantum systems.
From Appendix B we already know that the time-
independent |uj⟩’s (equivalently, the Floquet modes at
initial time t0, or more generally speaking, at any fixed
time t) form a complete and orthonormal basis of the
finite-dimensional Hilbert space Hof the quantum sys-
tem. With the help of Fourier’s theorem, we know that
the time-dependent Floquet modes each have a period
T= 2π/Ω such that each of them can be expressed as
(we use e−ilΩtinstead of e−ilΩ(t−t0)here so that the ef-
fects of the initial time t0are absorbed in the coefficients
a(l)

|uj(t)⟩=X

|ψk⟩,
(D1)
where {|ψk⟩}forms a complete and orthonormal basis of
Hthat may or may not be the same as {|uj⟩}. Realiz-
ing that the harmonics φ(l)(t) =e−ilΩtof a fundamental
frequency Ω form a complete and orthogonal basis of an-
other Hilbert space HTof square-integrable T-periodic
functions, with inner product defined as
⟨φ(l′), φ(l)⟩ ≡1
TZt0+T
t0dtφ(l′)∗(t)φ(l)(t) =δl,l′,(D2)
we readily see that the time-dependent Floquet modes
live in an extended Hilbert space HT⊗H(sometimes
also referred to as the Sambe space) whose basis can be
constructed by the direct product of φ(l)(t)’s and |ψk⟩’s:
|ψ(l)
k(t)⟩ ≡φ(l)(t)|ψk⟩. In this basis, we can express the
Floquet modes as
|uj(t)⟩=X
kla(l)
jkφ(l)(t)|ψk⟩=X
kla(l)
jk|ψ(l)
k(t)⟩.(D3)Moreover, the periodically time-dependent Hamiltonian
can also be expressed in terms of this basis:
H(t) =X
k,k′,l,l′h(l,l′)
kk′|ψ(l)

where h(l−l′)
kk′=1
TRt0+T
t0dtei(l−l′)Ωt⟨ψk|H(t)|ψ′
k⟩are the
matrix elements of H(t) in the extended Hilbert space.
For convenience in the upcoming discussions, we denote
the bold letter h(l)as the matrix whose ( k, k′) element is
h(l)
kk′.
Having introduced the notion of the extended Hilbert
space, we now discuss the Shirley-Floquet formalism.
First of all, since U(t, t0)|uj⟩=e−iϵj(t−t0)|uj(t)⟩satis-
fies the Schr¨ odinger equation, it is clear that the Floquet
modes |uj(t)⟩satisfy:
id
dt(e−iϵjt|uj(t)⟩) =ϵje−iϵjt|uj(t)⟩+e−iϵjtid
dt|uj(t)⟩
=H(t)e−iϵjt|uj(t)⟩
(D5)
and thus

H(t)−id
dt
|uj(t)⟩=ϵj|uj(t)⟩. (D6)
That is, the periodically time-dependent Floquet mode
|uj(t)⟩is the eigenstate of the operator K(t)≡H(t)−id
dt
acting on the extended Hilbert space, with eigenvalue ϵj.
Note that the action of K(t) on the extended Hilbert
space is crucial, else any solution of the time-dependent
Schr¨ odinger equation would be an eigenstate of K(t) with
zero eigenvalue. Here, we emphasize again that the quasi-
energy ϵjis not fully determined: if we consider a closely
related Floquet mode eilΩ(t−t0)|uj(t)⟩, it can be verified
that K(t)[eilΩ(t−t0)|uj(t)⟩] = ( ϵj+lΩ)eilΩ(t−t0)|uj(t)⟩.
This result indicates that multiplying the Floquet mode
|uj(t)⟩byeilΩ(t−t0)leads to a different eigenvalue ϵj+lΩ.
This will lead to some redundancy in the Floquet modes
obtained through the Shirley-Floquet formalism.
The equation for solving Floquet modes in Shirley-
Floquet formalism is the above eigenvalue equation in
the extended Hilbert space, which is usually written in13
the product basis:
H(t)|uj(t)⟩=X

(D7)
Matching the coefficients in front of each basis state
|ψ(l)
k(t)⟩=e−ilΩt|ψk⟩, we get the equation for each of
the coefficients:
X
k′,l′h(l−l′)
kk′a(l′)
jk′−lΩa(l)
jk=ϵja(l)

or more concisely:
X
k′,l′
h(l−l′)
kk′−lΩδkk′δll′
a(l′)
jk′=ϵja(l)
jk. (D9)
By solving the above equations, one can obtain the co-
efficients a(l)
jkin the product basis of the extended Hilbert
space, which physically correspond to the Fourier coeffi-
cients in the harmonic mode lΩ and the quantum Hilbert
space basis state |ψj⟩. We refer to this as the Schr¨ odinger
equation in Shirley-Floquet (SF) form . Rewritten in ma-
trix form, the operator K(t) acts on the extended Hilbert
spaceHT⊗Hand its matrix elements in the direct prod-
uct basis {|ψ(l)
k⟩=φ(l)(t)|ψk⟩}are given by
⟨ψ(l)
k|K(t)|ψ(l′)
k′⟩=h(l−l′)
kk′−lΩδkk′δll′≡(hSF)(l−l′)
kk′.
(D10)
This matrix hSFis typically referred to as the Shirley-
Floquet Hamiltonian , which is infinite-dimensional. This
is because we now associate each basis state |ψk⟩with
infinitely many Fourier coefficients with indices l=
0,±1,±2, .... As a result, the eigensolutions contain in-
finitely many eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates
that are linearly independent in the extended Hilbert
space. This reveals the redundancy we mentioned above:
starting with one Floquet mode |uj(t)⟩with quasi-energy
ϵj, we can multiply it by eilΩ(t−t0)with any arbitrary
integer lto generate another Floquet mode with quasi-
energy ϵj+lΩ. This procedure leads to infinitely many
eigenvalues and eigenstates in the SF form (the quasi-
energy ϵjis restricted to lie between 0 and Ω.)
We see that by implementing the SF formalism, say
for instance in a system that originally has nenergylevels and is driven harmonically, we obtain (infinitely)
many Floquet energy levels. These are the original nlev-
els shifted up or down by multiples of Ω, which corre-
spond to the lΩ terms on the diagonal of the SF Hamil-
tonian; the driving can thus be thought of as effectively
allowing “hopping” between different Floquet levels. This
perspective, which is often used in the condensed matter
literature, coincides with the tight-binding form of (D9)
and (D10). Explicitly, we can place the different Fourier
components of hSFin a large matrix:
hSF≡
...............
. . .h(0)+ ΩI h(−1)h(−2). . .
. . . h(1)h(0)h(−1). . .


=h+
...
ΩI

−ΩI
...
(D11)
and the vector ajcan be written in a corresponding way:
aj≡
...
a(−1)

. (D12)
Then, Eq. (D9) can be rewritten as
hSFaj=ϵjaj. (D13)
We will find it useful to represent hSFin the explicit
form given in Eq. (D11) when generalizing our discussion
to the Floquet-Lindblad equation, where we will have to
work with density matrices instead.
To implement the SF formalism in practice, we need
to place cutoffs on these infinite dimensional matrices,
preserving only certain elements in hSFanda. Typically,
when performing numerics, one usually preserves all the14
components in awithin a given frequency range: l=
0,±1,±2, ...,±L, such that hSFis also approximated by
a (2L+ 1)N×(2L+ 1)Nsquare matrix, where Nis the
dimension of H. This (2 L+ 1)N×(2L+ 1)Nsquare
matrix sits in the middle of the infinitely large hSF.
Besides placing the cutoff, in dealing with two-level
systems, the rotation wave approximation (RWA) is also
often used as a first-order approximation. Here, the RWA
means that we keep only two coefficients in a:a(−1)
1
anda(0)
2, or equivalently speaking, we are only inter-
ested in the sub-extended Hilbert space spanned by
{|ψ(−1)
1⟩,|ψ(0)
2⟩}. As a result, the matrix hSFis approx-
imated by a 2 by 2 matrix:

Appendix E: Shirley-Floquet formalism for
Floquet-Lindblad equations
Following our discussion of the SF formalism in closed
quantum systems, we now extend it to open quantum
systems, specifically those described by the Floquet-
Lindblad master equation. For simplicity, we will assume
here that the jump operators and their associated de-
cay rates are time-independent, with the periodic time
dependence stemming purely from the coherent Hamil-
tonian. Imitating the procedure from the preceding Ap-
pendix, we first bring the Floquet-Lindblad equation into
the form:

L(t)−d
dt
ρ(t)≡ K(t)ρ(t) = 0 , (E1)
where ρ(t) is some solution. However, if we consider a
Floquet-Lindblad eigenmode ϱj(t), it is nota solution of
the above equation: the proper solution is instead given
byU(t, t0)ρj=eλj(t−t0)ϱj(t), which leads to

L(t)−d
dt
eλj(t−t0)ϱj(t) = 0 (E2)
and hence K(t) has the same spectrum λj,
K(t)ϱj(t) =λjϱj(t). (E3)Therefore, we see that similarly to closed quantum sys-
tems, the periodically time-dependent Floquet-Lindblad
eigenmode ϱj(t) is an eigenoperator of the superoperator
K(t) acting on the extended Liouville space . A similar SF
formalism can then be established for the open systems.
Again, since the Floquet-Lindblad eigenmodes ϱj(t)’s
are time-periodic, we can expand them in the product
basis, as we did for the time-dependent unitary case:
ϱj(t) =X
k,k′,l,l′ϱ(l,l′)
j,kk′|ψ(l)
k(t)⟩⟨ψ(l′)
k′(t)|
=X
kk′,(l−l′)ϱ(l−l′)
j,kk′e−i(l−l′)Ωt|ψk⟩⟨ψk′|
ϱj(t) =X
kk′,lϱ(l)
j,kk′e−ilΩt|ψk⟩⟨ψk′|.(E4)
The jump operators are time-independent, which can be
easily expressed in the product basis with only zero fre-
quency terms:
Lµ=X
kk′Lµ,kk′|ψk⟩⟨ψk′| ≡X
kk′L(0)
µ,kk′|ψk⟩⟨ψk′|,(E5)
where the superscript (0) denotes zero frequency. As in
the previous Appendix, we will use bold letters ( h(l)and
ϱ(l)
j) to represent matrices.
Using the above, we can now express the equation
for calculating ϱj(t) in the Shirley-Floquet formalism.
First of all, consider the Hamiltonian term and the time-
derivative d/dt:
−i[H(t), ϱj(t)] =−iX

kk′h
h(l−l′),ϱ(l′)

kk′−lΩδll′ϱ(l′)

|ψk⟩⟨ψk′|. (E7)
Next, we consider the dissipator, which only depends on time through ϱj(t). We realize that in this part, the ma-15
trix elements of the operators are placed in a same way as the operators themselves:

where L(0)

in the previous Appendix). It can be shown that the

For the specific two-band model we consider in the
main text, which is effectively a two-level system in each
momentum sector, the band indices are given by k= 1,2
for the valance and conduction bands respectively. The
Floquet index is l= 0,±1,±2, ..., and the jump oper-
ators are L(0)

making the RWA means that we are interested in the
matrix elements only for the 2D sub-extended Hilbert
space spanned by {|ψ(−1)

erator O(t) that has periodic time dependence, we are

Appendix F: Evaluation of nonlinear optical
responses
In this Appendix, we evaluate the non-linear optical
effect in a two-band model as an example to illustrate
the procedure of evaluating physical quantities within the
Floquet-Lindblad formalism. The traditional setup is the
following: we shine a spatially uniform beam of laser on
a piece of solid with intrinsic (original) Hamiltonian H0,
rendering the system Hamiltonian time-dependent:
H(t) =H0+A(t)V0, (F1)
where A(t) is the vector potential and we have kept only
the linear term in A(t). The operator V0is the current
operator in the absence of driving . Now, we would like to
know what is the current induced in the solid in response
to the optical driving field.
As an illustration, we here model the solid as a sys-
tem of non-interacting spinless electrons with two energy
bands. The many-body Hamiltonian can be written in
terms of creation/annihilation operators c†
k,n, ck,nthat
creates/annihilates an electron in Bloch states |k, n⟩with
quasi-momentum kand band n:
H0=X
k2X
m,n=1c†
k,mh0
mn(k)ck,n, (F2)
where h0
mn(k)≡ ⟨k, m|h0|k, n⟩is the matrix element of
the first-quantized Hamiltonian h0between two Bloch
states. The Bloch state can be related to the Bloch
function state |uk,n⟩via|k, n⟩=eik·ˆr|uk,n⟩, where ˆr
is the position operator. Then we see that h0
mn(k) =
⟨uk,m|e−ik·ˆrh0eik·ˆr|uk,n⟩=⟨uk,m|h0(k)|uk,n⟩, where
h0(k)≡e−ik·ˆrh0eik·ˆris a first-quantized operator.
With the equation of motion for the first-quantized
position operator ˆr, one can derive that the second-
quantized current operator (in the absence of driving)takes the form
V0=X
k,m,nc†
k,m⟨uk,m|∂h0(k)
∂k|uk,n⟩ck,n≡X
k,m,nc†
k,mv0
mn(k)ck,n,
(F3)
where the derivative should be understood as a direc-
tional derivative in the direction of interest. We define
∂h0(k)
∂k≡v0(k), which is a first-quantized operator. Simi-
larly, one can derive the time-dependent current operator
in the presence of the time-dependent driving field as fol-
lows:

Now, it is clear that different momentum sectors do not
couple with one another in this simplified model. In the
situation where the band n= 1 is the fully occupied va-
lence band with dispersion ϵ0
1(k) and n= 2 is the empty
conduction band with dispersion ϵ0
2(k), each momentum
sector is only occupied by one electron. Therefore, we
can treat the whole system as a bunch of independent
two-level systems at different momenta k, whose time-
dependent Hamiltonians (written as 2-by-2 matrices in
the Bloch basis) are

We now wish to add dissipation to the system (in order
to model the effect of a photonic heat bath), obtain the
NESS ρss(t), and evaluate the response current J(t) =
Tr(V(t)ρss(t)). To keep the separation between different
momentum sectors, we add dissipation to the two-level17
system at each kvia jump operators:
L1=σ+=
0 1
0 0
,L2=σ−=
0 0
1 0
, (F6)
which represent the emission and absorption of one pho-
ton in the heat bath (not from the driving light field),
respectively.
For purposes of illustration, here we take the driving
to be harmonic such that A(t) =iAe−iΩt−iA∗eiΩt, and
then apply the RWA. Following the SF formalism de-
scribed in the prior Appendix, we see that within the
RWA there are only three Fourier components of h(k, t)
that are nonzero:
h(0)(k) =
ϵ0
1(k) 0
0ϵ0
2(k)
,
h(−1)(k) =−iA∗v0(k),
h(1)(k) =iAv0(k),(F7)
which directly lead to the SF Hamiltonian in RWA:
hRWA
SF(k) =
ϵ0
1(k) + Ω −iA∗v0
12(k)
iAv0
21(k) ϵ0
2(k)
. (F8)
After solving for the eigenoperators of the Floquet-
Lindblad equation, as is shown in the main text, we ob-
tain the NESS within the RWA, which can be represented
abstractly in the extended Hilbert space basis as:
ρRWA
ss(k) =ϱRWA
0(k)≡ 
ρ(0)
ss,11(k)ρ(−1)
ss,12(k)
ρ(1)
ss,21(k)ρ(0)
ss,22(k)!
.(F9)
This indicates that the NESS in the time domain is
ρRWA
ss(k, t)≡ 
ρ(0)
ss,11(k)ρ(−1)
ss,12(k)eiΩt
ρ(1)
ss,21(k)e−iΩtρ(0)
ss,22(k)!
.(F10)
The current operator V(t) in the momentum sector
kcan also now be represented by the following 2-by-2
matrix in Bloch basis:
v(k, t)
=
v0
11(k) +A(t)
∂v0(k)
∂k
11v0
12(k) +A(t)
∂v0(k)
∂k
12
v0
21(k) +A(t)
∂v0(k)
∂k
21v0
22(k) +A(t)
∂v0(k)
∂k
22
.
(F11)As a result, the current contributed by momentum sec-
torkis given by J(k, t) = Tr( v(k, t)ρRWA
ss(k, t)). It is
apparent that due to the multiplication of the terms
with different oscillating frequencies ( ±Ω and 0), the cur-
rent has three components, oscillating with frequencies
0,Ω,2Ω. The component with frequency Ω is the linear
response, which is not of interest, while the components
with frequencies 0 and 2Ω are second-order responses,
corresponding to nonlinear optical effects.
The zero frequency component, also called the DC re-
sponse, is given by:
JDC(k) =v0
11(k)ρ(0)
ss,11(k)−iA∗∂v0(k)
∂k
12ρ(1)
ss,21(k)
+iA∂v0(k)
∂k
21ρ(−1)
ss,12(k) +v0
22(k)ρ(0)
ss,22(k)
=Tr
vRWA(k)ρRWA
ss(k)
(F12)
where the matrix vRWA(k) is a 2-by-2 matrix represented
in the extended Hilbert space basis as
vRWA(k) =
v0
11(k)−iA∗
∂v0(k)
∂k
12
iA
∂v0(k)
∂k
21v0
22(k).
(F13)
The component with frequency 2Ω is called the “second
harmonic generation (SHG)”, which is given by
JSHG(k, t) =iA∂v0(k)
∂k
12ρ(1)
ss,21(k)e−2iΩt
−iA∗∂v0(k)
∂k
21ρ(−1)
ss,12(k)e2iΩt.(F14)
The total current J(t) is then the summation of the con-
tributions from all momentum sectors.
Before ending the discussion of nonlinear optical ef-
fects, we would like to mention that the above results are
derived under the assumption that the time-dependent
Hamiltonian of the system takes the exact form of (F1).
However, in some physical situations, especially when the
light field A(t) is strong, we will need to include higher-
order terms of A(t) in the Hamiltonian to get more pre-
cise results. This way, the time-dependent Hamiltonian
will no longer be monochromatic and we will need to
include more Fourier components of the NESS solution
ρss(t) to obtain the nonlinear optical responses.
