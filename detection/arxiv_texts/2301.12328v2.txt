Abstract. The kinetic energy of the fluid shell in the cosmological first-order phase tran-
sition is crucial for predicting the gravitational wave signals generated by the sound wave
mechanism. We propose a model-dependent method to calculate the kinetic energy fraction
by dividing the bubble-fluid system into three distinct regions: the symmetric phase, the
broken phase, and the bubble wall. By solving the local equation of motion of the scalar
field with a phenomenological friction term, the bubble wall velocity and the boundary con-
ditions of the fluid equations of both phases can be derived simultaneously. Then, for a
given particle physics model, the fluid profiles of different hydrodynamical modes and the
corresponding kinetic energy fraction can be obtained. Our method can also capture the
temperature dependency of the sound speed of the plasma. Compared with the conventional
model-independent method, our approach is based on an accurate equation of state derived
directly from the effective potential and takes into account the contribution of the bubble wall
to the energy-momentum tensor. Therefore, our method in-principle provides a more consis-
tent and accurate result, which is crucial for high-precision calculations of the gravitational
waves induced by the first-order phase transition.

1 Introduction
The cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) and its associated phase transition
gravitational waves (GWs) open a new window to explore many fundamental problems in
particle cosmology, such as electroweak baryogenesis [1, 2] and dark matter [3–7], etc. During
an FOPT, GW signals can be generated by bubble collisions [8–10], sound waves [11–13], and
turbulence [14–16]. Future GW experiments, such as TianQin [17, 18], LISA [19], Taiji [20],
and Big Bang Observatory (BBO) [21], among others, may be able to detect phase transition
GW signals and reveal various puzzles about our Universe. Recent studies [11–13] have shown
that the sound wave is the dominant source of phase transition GWs in a thermal FOPT. To
finally pin down the underlying physics of an FOPT, we need precise quantification of the
GW spectra and their signal-to-noise ratio in future GW experiments. To that end, obtaining
accurate estimations of phase transition parameters that determine the GW spectra become
critical. The two most crucial variables among these parameters are the bubble wall velocity
and the energy budget, where the latter is also known as the kinetic energy fraction, which
characterizes the fraction of energy released during an FOPT that is transferred into the
kinetic energy of the ambient fluid.
Previous studies [22–28] on the energy budget of an FOPT are based on the conventional
model-independent method. This method matches a well-motivated particle physics model
to a specific model of equation of state (EoS) according to some phase transition parameters,
such as the strength parameter and the bubble wall velocity. As a result, the boundary
conditions of the fluid equations can be determined, and then the corresponding kinetic
energy fraction can be derived. However, the specific model of EoS, such as the bag model,
– 1 –cannot fully capture the features of the symmetric and broken phases since some important
factors are ignored, such as the variation of the sound speed of the plasma. To address these
limitations, someothermodelsofEoSareconstructed. Forexample, the µνmodel[24–27]can
take the variation of the sound speed into account by considering it as an extra parameter.
Additionally, to incorporate the temperature-dependent sound speed, a more complicated
model of EoS is built in ref. [28], which includes more extra parameters. Although the model-
independent method is convenient for studying various particle physics models, the accuracy
of this method depends on the constructed EoS model. To capture all relevant properties, a
complicatedEoSmodelshouldbeconsidered,andsophisticatedcalculationscouldbeinvolved.
Furthermore, the calculation of the bubble wall velocity is decoupled from the kinetic energy
fraction in the conventional model-independent method.
The bubble wall velocity is strongly correlated with the energy budget, and recent stud-
ies [29–32] show that the fluid dynamics can have a significant impact on it. To this end, in
this work, we unify the calculation of the energy budget and the bubble wall velocity into a
single framework. Given that the phase transition system is a coupled fluid-scalar system, we
divide it into three regions, which are the symmetric phase, the broken phase, and the bubble
wall. The plasma in the symmetric and broken phases is treated as a perfect fluid, and the
corresponding EoS of both phases are directly obtained from the effective potential of the
particle physics model, which is actually the free energy of the phase transition system. In
contrast to the conventional model-independent method, our approach does not require the
construction of a model of EoS but derives it directly from the effective potential. To obtain
the kinetic energy fraction, the fluid equations in both phases with proper boundary condi-
tions need to be solved. In our framework, we derive the corresponding boundary conditions
by solving the local equations of motion (EoM) of the scalar field and the fluid across the
bubble wall. To simplify the calculation, a phenomenological friction term characterizing the
out-of-equilibrium phenomena is introduced. With the planar approximation, we solve the
scalar field and fluid profiles, thereby obtaining the bubble wall velocity and the boundary
conditions for the fluid equations of both phases. This allows us to finally solve the fluid
profiles in both phases and derive the energy budget. Since the contribution of the scalar
field to the energy-momentum tensor is taken into account, and the EoS is directly obtained
from the effective potential, our model-dependent method can provide more consistent and
accurate results in principle.
This work is organized as follow. In section 2, we introduce the general hydrodynamical
treatment of the FOPT system. Then we propose our model-dependent method for the
calculation of energy budget in section 3, where the definition of the kinetic energy fraction
and a review of the conventional model-independent method to quantify it are also given.
In section 4, we use a representative model to demonstrate our model-dependent analysis
method. Discussion and conclusion are given in section 5 and section 6, respectively.
2 Hydrodynamics
The thermal cosmological FOPT system consists of scalar fields, which act as the order
parameter of the phase transition, and the thermal plasma. The energy-momentum tensor of
Nscalar fields is
Tµν
ϕ=∂µϕi∂νϕi−gµν1
2∂αϕi∂αϕi−V0(Φ)
, (2.1)
– 2 –where V0(Φ)is the one-loop zero temperature potential, the repeated indices are summed
over and Φ≡ {ϕ1, ϕ2, ..., ϕ N}. The energy-momentum tensor of the plasma can be derived
by
Tµν
pl=X
iZd3k
(2π)3Eikµkνfi(k, x), (2.2)
where fi(k, x)is the distribution function for different particle species and the sum is over
all particle species in the plasma. If we assume the plasma is perfect fluid, the corresponding
energy-momentum tensor can be given by
Tµν
pl= (e+p)uµuν−gµνp, (2.3)
where eandpare the energy and pressure of the plasma, respectively, and the four-velocity
uµis
uµ=1√
1−v2(1,v) = (γ, γv), (2.4)
where vis the three-velocity and γis the Lorentz factor. Note that the pressure palso
contains the contribution of the scalar fields. And the relations of these thermodynamical
quantities are
w≡T∂p
∂T, e≡T∂p
∂T−p, s ≡∂p
∂T, (2.5)
where Tdenotes the temperature of the plasma, sis the entropy, and we have w=e+p. For
a FOPT system, the energy eand pressure p(the EoS) are
e(Φ, T) =aT4+Veff(Φ, T)−T∂Veff
∂T, (2.6)
p(Φ, T) =1
3aT4−Veff(Φ, T), (2.7)
where a=g∗π2/30andg∗is the number of degree of freedom, and Veff(Φ, T)is the finite
temperature effective potential of the scaler fields, which can be calculated with a standard
method [33] for a given particle physics model.
Now, the energy-momentum tensor of the whole phase transition system is
Tµν=∂µϕi∂νϕi−gµν1
2∂αϕi∂αϕi
+wuµuν−gµνp, (2.8)
where the metric gµν= diag {+− −−}. The energy-momentum conservation gives
∂µTµν=∂µTµν
ϕ+∂µTµν
pl= 0. (2.9)
At the bubble wall, we have to fully consider the contribution of the scalar fields and the
plasma to the energy-momentum tensor. When particles penetrate the bubble wall, they
should experience an out-of-equilibrium phenomenon, and this should give an effective friction
force to the bubble wall. Here we introduce a phenomenological dissipative (or friction) term,
which parameterizes the out-of-equilibrium phenomenon and also acts as an effective friction.
This friction term is also responsible for the entropy production at the bubble wall. And
eq. (2.9) can be further expressed by
∂µTµν=∂µTµν
ϕ+∂µTµν
pl=χν−χν= 0, (2.10)
– 3 –where we choose χν=ηuµ∂µϕi∂νϕias in refs. [34, 35]. Note that there are also other choices
for this friction term as suggested in refs. [36–38]. Substituting χνinto eq. (2.1) and eq. (2.3),
we have
∂µTµν
ϕ=∂µ∂µϕi∂νϕi+∂Veff
∂ϕi∂νϕi=−ηuµ∂µϕi∂νϕi, (2.11)
∂µTµν
pl=∂µ(wuµuν)−∂νp+∂Veff
∂ϕi∂νϕi=ηuµ∂µϕi∂νϕi. (2.12)
The FOPT proceeds with bubble nucleation, expansion, and collision. To gain a complete
understanding of the dynamics of an FOPT system, numerical hydrodynamical simulations
mush be performed, although they could be rather computationally difficult and expensive.
Fortunately, after bubble nucleation, the bubble will quickly reach a steady-state stage and
expand with a terminal bubble wall velocity vw. As a result, for simplicity, we can focus
on dynamics of the system during the steady-state stage, where the time-dependence can be
neglectedinthewallframe. Then, thesystemcanbedividedintothreeregions: thesymmetric
phase (the plasma outside the bubble), the broken phase (the plasma in the bubble), and
the bubble wall. In the symmetric and broken phases, the plasma can be treated as being
in thermal equilibrium, with the contribution of the scalar fields to the energy momentum
tensor Tµν
ϕbeing constant. Hence, we can just analyze the dynamics of the perfect fluid based
on energy-momentum conservation, ∂µTµν
pl= 0. While in the region of the bubble wall, the
plasma encounters an out-of-equilibrium phenomenon, which is parameterized by the friction
term χν, and the scalar fields vary violently; and the energy-momentum conservation law
of the plasma ∂µTµν
pl= 0fails in this region. Therefore, both scalars and plasma must be
considered in this region with ∂µTµν=∂µTµν
ϕ+∂µTµν
pl= 0. The dynamics of these three
regions should be discussed independently, as detailed in the following subsections.
2.1 Across the bubble wall
At the bubble wall, we have to fully consider the contribution of the scalar fields and the
plasma to the energy-momentum tensor. From eq. (2.11) and eq. (2.12), without assuming
any symmetries, we have
¨ϕ− ∇2ϕ+∂Veff
∂ϕ=−ηγ(˙ϕ+vi∂iϕ), (2.13)
˙E+∂i(Evi) +p[ ˙γ+∂i(γvi)]−∂Veff

˙Zi+∂j(Zivj) +∂ip+∂Veff
∂ϕ∂iϕ=−ηγ(˙ϕ+vj∂jϕ)∂iϕ. (2.15)
where vi=ui/γ,E=γeandZi=γ2(e+p)vi. While for simplicity, some symmetries are
inserted in these equations, and we just discuss the case with a single scalar1henceforth. In
this work, we assume a planar symmetry, which enforces uµ=γ(1,0,0, v), then we have
¨ϕ−∂2

∂νϕ. (2.17)
1Generalizing to the case with multiple scalar fields is straightforward.
– 4 –At the steady-state stage, the time-derivative can be neglected in the wall frame. Therefore,
the steady-state profiles across the bubble wall can be derived by the following differential
equations

For different hydrodynamical modes, the initial conditions of these differential equations are
different. Once the initial conditions are fixed, we can derive the spatial dependent scalar
fieldϕ(z), velocity v(z), and temperature T(z)profiles across the bubble wall. These profiles
actually give various quantities ( ϕ+,ϕ−,v+,v−,T+, and T−) just in front of and behind
the bubble wall, where quantities in symmetric phase are denoted with subscript +, while −
represents quantities in the broken phase. These are the key quantities for conducting the
model-dependent analysis of the kinetic energy fraction.
2.2 Away from the bubble wall
The dynamics of the plasma in the broken and symmetric phases can be descried by the
energy-momentum conservation law of the perfect fluid. Inserting some specific symmetries,
we have [23, 39]
∂t[(e+pv2)γ2] +∂r[(e+p)γ2v] =−j
r[(e+p)γ2v], (2.21)
∂t[(e+p)γ2v] +∂r[(ev2+p)γ2] =−j
r[(e+p)γ2v2], (2.22)
where j= 2,1, and 0for spherical, cylindrical and planar symmetry, respectively. Note that
the covariant derivative and the different metrics should be employed to derive the spherical
and cylindrical cases. ris the distance from the symmetry point, axis and plane, and tis
the elapsed time since the bubble nucleation. At the steady-state stage, both the bubble
and fluid profiles are self-similar, which means they maintain their relative shape but rescale
as the bubble expands. This self-similar solution only depends on ξ=r/t, thus we have
∂t=−(ξ/t)∂ξand∂r= (1/t)∂ξ. Therefore, we can derive
(ξ−v)∂ξe
w=jv
ξ+ [1−γ2v(ξ−v)]∂ξv, (2.23)
(1−vξ)∂ξp
w=γ2(ξ−v)∂ξv, (2.24)
where ∂ξeand∂ξpcan be related by the sound speed of the plasma, which is defined as
c2
s≡dp/de = (dp/dT )/(de/dT ). Hence, the sound speed of the plasma is temperature-
dependent in general. Then the equations describing the velocity, enthalpy, and temperature
profile are

µ(ξ, v) =ξ−v
1−ξv. (2.28)
With appropriate boundary conditions, we can solve the velocity v(ξ), enthalpy w(ξ), and
temperature T(ξ)profiles. The boundary conditions can be obtained by the conventional
model-independent method [22–28], based on various approximations. In this work, we pro-
pose a model-dependent method that preserves the temperature- and position-dependent
nature of the sound speed to derive the corresponding boundary conditions. In the following
section, we will go over both methods in detail.
3 Kinetic energy fraction
For a thermal cosmological FOPT, the latent heat released by the phase transition must be
transferred into the gradient energy of the bubble wall, as well as the thermal energy and
kinetic energy of the ambient plasma. And the so-called "energy budget" of the cosmological
FOPT refers the amount of energy obtained by the bubble wall and the plasma. After bubble
collisions, the gradient energy stored in the bubble wall and the kinetic energy of the plasma
will generate GW signals. According to recent studies [40, 41], during the phase transition,
GW signals can be produced by three mechanisms, which are bubble collisions, sound waves,
and turbulence; and the dominant source of the phase transition GWs is the sound waves in a
thermal FOPT. As a result, the kinetic energy fraction K, which denotes the fraction of the
total energy of the bubble that is converted to the kinetic energy of the ambient plasma, is a
crucial parameter in determining the strength of GW spectrum. In fact, the GW spectrum
from sound wave mechanism scales as h2ΩGW∝K2orh2ΩGW∝K3/2. According to the
energy-momentum tensor of the perfect fluid, i.e., eq. (2.3), the kinetic energy density of the
fluid is [23]
ekin=T00(v)−T00(0) = wv2γ2. (3.1)
The volume of the planar, cylindrical, and spherical bubble (i.e. the volume of bubble in one,
two, and three space dimension case) can be expressed as
Vb=CjRj+1
b/(j+ 1), (3.2)
where Cjis an irrelevant factor in our calculation, and Rb=vwtis the bubble radius. The
kinetic energy of the fluid is
Ekin=CjZ
wv2γ2RjdR. (3.3)
Based on the definition of the kinetic energy fraction (i.e. the ratio of the kinetic energy to
the total energy the bubble contain), we have
K≡Ekin
e+Vb. (3.4)
By plugging in eq. (3.2) and (3.3), we have
K=j+ 1
e+vj+1

To derive the kinetic energy fraction, both the enthalpy w(ξ)and velocity profiles v(ξ)of
different hydrodynamical modes must be calculated properly. Contrary to the conventional
model-independent method, we propose a model-dependent method to compute the kinetic
energy fraction. In the following, we first review possible hydrodynamical modes and the
conventional model-independent method then present the model-dependent analysis method
in details.
3.1 Hydrodynamical modes
There are two kinds of hydrodynamical modes in a thermal FOPT: the detonation mode and
the deflagration mode. These modes are described by physical quantities shown in figure 1,
where the top panel depicts a typical deflagration, while the bottom panel shows a typical
detonation. In the rest frame of the bubble wall, the fluid velocity of the incoming flow is
denoted as v+, while the outgoing fluid velocity is v−. For a detonation mode, the fluid is
decelerated by the bubble wall ( v+> v−), and the incoming flow is supersonic ( v+> cs).
Whereas for deflagrations, the outgoing fluid is accelerated by the bubble wall ( v−> v+), and
v+< cs. While in the rest frame of the shock front, the incoming fluid velocity is represented
byv2and the outgoing fluid velocity is denoted by v1. Depending on the outgoing flow is
subsonic or supersonic, these two modes can be further divided into weak ( v−< cs), Jouguet
(v−=cs), and strong ( v−> cs) detonations, and weak ( v−< cs), Jouguet ( v−=cs), and
strong ( v−> cs) deflagrations. However, previous studies [35, 42, 43] have shown that only
three modes are stable in an FOPT, namely, weak detonation, weak deflagration, and Jouguet
deflagration (i.e., the supersonic deflagration or hybrid). In the rest part of this work, the
terms "detonations" and "deflagrations" refer to weak detonations and weak deflagrations.
And the Jouget deflagration (hybrid) mode is beyond the scope of this work and will be
discussed in the future work.
Intherestframeofthebubblecenter, orequivalentlytheplasmaframe, thefluidvelocity
is denoted by ˜v. Then the incoming fluid velocity is ˜v+and the outgoing fluid velocity is ˜v−.
As shown in figure 1, the detonation forms a rarefaction wave behind the wall, while the
deflagration results in a shock wave just in front of the wall. The fluid must be at rest at the
bubble center and far in front of from the bubble wall. Therefore, in a detonation mode, the
fluid in front of the wall is at rest when it is hit by the wall, and the wall is followed by a
rarefaction wave, which smoothly reduces the fluid velocity ˜vto zero at ξ=cs,−, acting as a
weak discontinuity. In the deflagration mode, however, a shock wave that is able to heat up
the fluid proceeds in front of the wall, and the fluid behind the wall is at rest. In addition,

3.2 Model-independent analysis
Here, we first review the conventional model-independent method. Figure 2 demonstrates
the whole process of the model-independent analysis with the detail procedure described as
follows:

•Define the parameters that are crucial for matching a particle physics model to the
specific model of EoS one constructed, for example, the strength parameter α, the
sound speed cs, etc.
•Calculate the effective potential of some well-motivated particle physics models with a
conventional or improved method.
•Compute the characteristic temperature T∗, the strength parameter α, the sound speed
cs, and other possible parameters, which depend on the constructed EoS model, based
on the effective potential.
•Estimate the bubble wall velocity vwwith some appropriate method or manually give
it a reasonable value.
•Substitute the strength parameter α, the bubble wall velocity vw, the sound speed cs,
and other possible parameters into the matching condition and derive the boundary
conditions.
•Solve the fluid equation with boundary conditions of different hydrodynamical modes,
then obtain the corresponding fluid profiles.
•Relying on the fluid profiles of different hydrodynamical modes, i.e., weak detonation,
weak deflagration, and hybrid, finally derive the kinetic energy fraction with eq. (3.5).
Next we describe the model-independent method in more detail. In most studies, the
above procedure is usually performed using the bag model of EoS. For the bag model, in the
symmetric phase, we have

where ϵis the bag constant, which characterises the false-vacuum energy. To observe the
logic of using the bag model to describe the FOPT, we can start with the effective potential,
which is also the free energy of the whole FOPT system. The validity of using bag model to
describe the FOPT system can be established by analyzing an effective potential. For a given
particle physics model, the effective potential can be divided into two parts
F(ϕ, T) =Veff(ϕ, T) =VT=0(ϕ) +VT(ϕ, T), (3.10)
where the one-loop zero temperature part is VT=0(ϕ), while the one-loop thermal correction

functions is preserved, we can have

However, keeping only the first term of the high temperature expansion is a rather crude
approximation. Higher order terms of ycan definitely give significant modifications. Taking

parently, according to the definition of sound speed ( c2
s=dp/deand−F=p), the O(y2)
will modify it. To include the corrections to the sound speed from higher order terms, one
construct the µνmodel [24–27], which takes the sound speed of both phases as extra parame-
ters, and the sound speed is still constant in this model. However, from eq (3.16), we can find
the sound speed is actually temperature dependent, and the temperature around the bub-
ble wall is position-dependent, which makes the sound speed position-dependent. Recently,
ref [28] constructed a model of EoS to describe the temperature-dependent sound speed by
introducing more parameters. Nevertheless, the accuracy is only kept at specify orders of y.
To resolve this problem, we propose a model-dependent method in the next subsection.

+, (3.17)
which are obtained from the energy-momentum conservation ∂µTµν
pl= 0across the wall.
Note that the bubble wall is treated as a discontinuity, and the contribution to the energy-
momentum tensor from the bubble wall is neglected. Then the strength parameter in the bag
model to carry out the matching process can be defined as
α=ϵ
a+T4
+. (3.18)
Note that the definition of strength parameter is usually more complicated in other more so-
phisticated models of EoS [24–28]. From the effective potential, we can calculate the bubble
wallvelocity vw,strengthparameters α,soundspeed cs,andotherpossibleparametersatchar-
acteristic temperature T∗. Then the matching process can be done after obtaining all those
quantities, and we can derive the boundary condition for the fluid equations (2.25), (2.26),
and (2.27). Based on the boundary conditions, the fluid profiles for different hydrodynamical
modes can be derived, which finally give the kinetic energy fraction.
3.3 Model-dependent analysis
Throughthematchingprocess, itisstraightforwardtoquantifytheenergybudgetfordifferent
particle physics models using the model-independent method. However, the accuracy of this
method depends on the model of EoS, and we also need to separately calculate the bubble
wall velocity. Furthermore, recent studies [29–32] have shown that the hydrodynamics of both
phases has a rather strong effect on the bubble wall velocity. Hence, it is more reasonable to
combine the calculation of the hydrodynamics and the bubble wall velocity. Since the effective
potential of the particle physics model is the free energy of the phase transition system, we
can actually derive the EoS directly from the effective potential without constructing any
additional EoS. Therefore, we propose a model-dependent analysis method for calculating
the energy budget, and the basic idea of this method is shown in figure 3. In the following,
we demonstrate the whole procedure:
•Calculate the effective potential for a given specific particle physics model.
•Derive the characteristic temperature with the standard method.

(2.27), with the boundary conditions given by the profiles across the bubble wall, the
fluid profiles for different hydrodynamical modes can be solved.
•Using the fluid profiles of different hydrodynamical modes, the kinetic energy fraction
can be eventually obtained with eq. (3.5).
In the following two subsections, for different hydrodynamical modes, we describe how to
calculate the local EoM across the bubble wall and derive the corresponding profiles in detail.
3.3.1 Deflagration
Deflagration modes develop a shock front in the symmetric phase, which is a discontinuity.
From the energy-momentum conservation across the shock front ∂µTµν
pl= 0, we can obtain
the following relations of relevant quantities in the shock front frame:
v1v2=c2
s,+,v1
v2=T4
2+c2
s,+T4

where cs,+is the sound speed of the symmetric phase, and cs,+= 1/√

transition. Therefore, we have

2, v 2=1
3v1, (3.25)
and
T2=T∗, v 2=vsh. (3.26)
In the equations above, all of the velocities are represented by their absolute values. In
figure 1, the directions of bubble wall and shock front velocities are to the right, while the
fluid velocities are to the left. Hence, if the bubble wall and shock front velocities are positive,
the fluid velocity is then negative. For the deflagration mode, the procedures for computing
the bubble and fluid profiles across the wall are shown in the following:
1. Guess the bubble wall velocity vw(vw< csfor deflagration mode) and the temperature
just behind the shock front T1, and derive the constants C1andC2atz=zsh(zshis

according to eqs. (3.24) and (3.25), the absolute value of v1,wfcan be calculated through
the following formula:

have v(+∞) =v1,wf,ϕ(+∞) = 0andT(+∞) =T1, the problem is solved. Otherwise,
we repeat the above steps until the condition is fulfilled. Note: if we can not find a
bubble wall velocity below 1/√
3that satisfy the conditions, then the deflagration solution
dose not exist for a given friction parameter ˜η.
3.3.2 Detonation
For a detonation mode, the fluid is at rest in front of the bubble wall in the plasma frame.
Hence, we have
v+=vw, T +=T∗. (3.33)
The procedure of calculating field and fluid profiles across the bubble wall is shown in the
following:
1. Guess the bubble wall velocity vwand the fluid velocity just behind the wall v0, then
derive C1andC2atz= +∞with the subsequent relations

3. Solve the differential equations (3.19) and compute vandTat the same time. If we
have T(+∞) =T∗,ϕ(+∞) = 0andv(+∞) =vw, the problem is solved. Otherwise, we
repeat the above steps until the condition is fulfilled. Note: if we can not find a bubble
wall velocity satisfies the conditions, then the detonation solution dose not exist for a
given friction parameter ˜η.
In this work, the friction parameter ˜ηis treated as a free parameters for simplicity. However,
in principle, this parameter is calculable for a given particle physics model [38, 44–46].
– 14 –4 A representative model
In the following, we apply our model-dependent method to a representative model for illus-
tration. The representative model is
Veff(ϕ, T)≈1
2(m2+cT2)ϕ2−ETϕ3+λ
4ϕ4. (4.1)
where m2=−λv2
0, and vacuum expectation value v0= 246 .22 GeV for electroweak phase
transition. This representative model can denote a large class of particle physics models [5, 6,
47–50], suchasthestandardmodel, thetwo-Higgsdoubletmodel, theminimalsupersymmetry
model, thesingletmodel, andthehiddenphasetransitionmodel, etc. Inthismodel, thelowest
temperature T0where the symmetric minimum still exists is
T2
0=λv2
c. (4.2)
The critical temperature where the degenerate minimum exists is
T2
c=T2
0
1−2E2/(λc). (4.3)
When the temperature is below the critical temperature, the global minimum is
ϕtrue=3ET+p
9E2T2−4λ(m2+cT2)
2λ. (4.4)
Note that when temperature is slightly higher than the critical temperature, this point be-
comes a local minimum. According to eq. (4.1), we can further derive the corresponding EoS
of this model as
p=1
3aT4−m2+cT2
2ϕ2+ETϕ3−λ
4ϕ4,
e=aT4+m2−cT2
2ϕ2+λ
4ϕ4,(4.5)
then the enthalpy can be obtained as

and the temperature-dependent sound speed is
c2
s(T) =1

(−aT4/3 +Veff)′′, (4.7)
where prime represents the total derivative with respect to temperature T. We assume that
the bubble achieves steady-sate stage immediately after nucleation. Then the temperature
far in front of the bubble wall can be approximated as nucleation temperature3Tn, and the
nucleationtemperaturecanbecalculatedusingthestandardmethod. Here, wegivethemodel
parameters and the corresponding phase transition parameters of the representative model
3Refs. [41, 51–53] suggest the percolation temperature should be a better choice for the characteristic
temperature in the calculation of phase transition GW.

the bubble wall velocity as vw=−v−= 0.1, and the corresponding friction parameters are given in
table 2. The units of ϕandTare[GeV], and the units of zare[GeV−1].
For the deflagration mode, we fixed the bubble wall velocity as vw=−v+= 0.1for simplic-
ity; the friction parameter ˜ηis treated as a free parameter, and the corresponding friction
parameters of these benchmark points are given in table 2. However, in a realistic model, the
friction parameters should be calculated first, and the bubble wall velocity can be derived
after that. Here, in figure 4, for the deflagration mode, we show the bubble ϕ(z), velocity v(z)
and temperature T(z)profiles of three parameter sets. The top panel shows the correspond-
ing profiles across the bubble wall of BP1, the middle panel denotes the profiles of BP2, and
the bottom panel depicts the profiles of BP3. To derive a consistent detonation solution, we
need to vary the value of the friction parameter ˜η. But in the frictionless case, where ˜η= 0,
a detonation mode can not be found for all three benchmark points when T+=Tn, where
T+denotes the temperature just in front of the bubble wall. As a result, we have to increase
the amount of supercooling by decreasing T+(T0< T +< Tn). Then, a consistent detonation
mode can be constructed for BP3 when T+= 0.9Tc. According to our study and refs [34, 38],
we can conclude that a detonation mode can only exist when the supercooling is large enough

And this actually requires an effective potential having a deep global minimum and relatively
low potential barrier between the global and local minimum at characteristic temperature.
Figure 5 shows the detonation profiles of BP3 when T+= 0.9Tc, and the corresponding
friction parameters are given in table 3. After we derive profiles across the bubble wall, the
boundary conditions of the fluid eqs. (2.25), (2.26), and (2.27) can be simultaneously derived.
In table 2, we provide the boundary conditions of the deflagration mode for all three bench-
mark points. We find the temperature of the fluid behind the bubble wall T−is larger than
the temperature far in front of the bubble wall for each benchmark point. Therefore, the fluid
behind the bubble wall is also heated for a deflagration mode. For the detonation mode, the
corresponding boundary conditions are given in table 3. With these boundary conditions, we
can derive the fluid profiles in both phases for different hydrodynamical modes.
4.2 Fluid profiles
With the boundary conditions given in table 2 and table 3, we can solve the fluid equa-
tions (2.25), (2.26), and (2.27), then derive the corresponding fluid profiles for deflagration
and detonation modes. However, to derive the fluid profiles in both phases, the EoS of both
phases are needed. From eq. (4.5), the EoS of the representative model in the symmetric
phase is

and it is temperature-dependent. Note that we assume ahas the same value in both phases.
Since we assume the bubble preserves a planar symmetry, for consistency, the planer fluid
profiles of this representative model should be constructed. For the planar approximation,
some simple solutions [23, 24, 39] as following can thus be derived from the fluid equations:
˜v(ξ) = constant , (4.15)
˜vrar=ξ−cs
1−csξ. (4.16)
Next, we show in detail how to construct self-similar planar fluid profiles for deflagration and
detonation modes.
For the deflagration mode, in the plasma frame, the turbulent flow is in the symmetric
phase and the fluid is at rest in the broken phase. Since we assume a planar symmetry for
the fluid profiles, the velocity, temperature, and enthalpy profiles should be constant until

plasma frame. Since, we have already obtained the boundary conditions of fluid velocity in
the wall frame and the bubble wall velocity from the local EoM across the bubble wall, we
can derive the fluid velocity in the plasma frame as
˜vdef=vw− |v+|
1−vw|v+|. (4.17)
With the planar symmetry, fluid profiles of the deflagration mode should be constant, we can
derive the corresponding profiles after determining the position of the shock front. For the
representative model, the position of shock front is
ξsh=2q
4˜v2
def+ 12−2˜vdef, (4.18)
andξsh=vsh. At the steady-state stage, the width of bubble wall is negligible compared to
the bubble radius [12, 35, 42, 43]. Hence, for the simplicity, the width of the bubble wall is
considered as infinitesimally small, and the initial position of the fluid profiles can be set at
ξ0=vw= 0.1. Therefore, thecorrespondingfluidprofilesincludingvelocity ˜v(ξ), temperature

represents the fluid profiles of BP2, and the bottom panel depicts the fluid profiles of BP3.
The bule lines in figure 6 are the results derived from the model-dependent method, while
the orange and green lines are profiles obtained using the conventional model-independent
method with the bag model of EoS and the µνmodel of EoS, respectively. As shown in
figure 6, the differences of the profiles derived by both methods decrease as the strength
of the phase transition grows. For the deflagration, our method does not show significant
differences compared to the model-independent method, and the results derived by the µν
model are almost the same as the model-dependent method. Since the EoS of the symmetric
phase of the representative model is similar to the bag model, both of them only contain the
first-order terms of the high-temperature expansion. However, if we consider a multiple-step
phase transition, which can be realized in a particle physics model with multiple scalars, the

difference between our method and the conventional method should be more significant. We
will leave the study of the multiple-step phase transition to our future study.
For detonation cases, the fluid profile should be the superposition of eq. (4.15) and
eq. (4.16). Namely, the fluid velocity is a constant just behind the wall, then at a specific
point the profile should be connected with a rarefaction solution. The position of the turning
point is
ξtp=˜v−+cs,−
1 + ˜v−cs,−(4.19)
where ˜v−andcs,−, which describe the fluid velocity and the sound speed just behind the
bubble wall, can be derived from the boundary conditions given in table 3 and eq. (4.7). In
the bag model of EoS or the µνmodel, the sound speed csis a constant in the broken phase.
However, in more general cases, cs=cs(ξ), the sound speed is actually position-dependent.
Substituting eq. (4.16) into eq. (2.27), we have the following ordinary differential equations
∂ξT=Tγ2µ∂ξ˜vrar,
∂ξ˜vrar=d
dξξ−cs
1−csξ(4.20)
Since the initial conditions of the fluid velocity and temperature are obtained from the profiles
across the wall, we can directly derive the rarefaction part of the detonation profile. With
the constant and the rarefaction parts determined, combining them enables us to quantify
the fluid profiles of the detonation mode. In figure 7, we show the fluid profiles of BP3
for a detonation mode with our model-dependent method (blue lines) and compare them to
the traditional methods (orange and green lines). As shown in figure 7, the differences of
the profiles derived by different methods are significant for the detonation mode. Here, we
neglect the thickness of the bubble wall based on refs [12, 35, 42, 43], the initial point of the
fluid profiles of detonation mode is at ξ= 0.9.
With the self-similar fluid profiles shown in figure 6 and figure 7, we can finally calculate
the kinetic energy fraction of this representative model using eq. (3.5). In table 4, we present
the corresponding kinetic energy fractions of the three benchmark points BP1, BP2, and
BP3 calculated by the model-dependent and the model-independent methods, respectively.
Here, we use Kplato represent the kinetic energy fraction derived by the model-dependent

model-independent method based on the bag EoS and the µνEoS, respectively. We also
give the relative corrections of model-independent method compared to the model-dependent
method. For the three benchmark points, we observe that in the deflagration mode, the
relative corrections range from 10% to 30% for the bag model. As for the µνmodel, the
relative corrections are around 1%. This conventional model-independent method based on
theµνmodel significantly improves the results. However, for BP3 in the detonation mode,
significant differences between the model-dependent and the model-independent methods are
found. The relative corrections for the bag model are close to 300%, while for the µνmodel,
the relative corrections are approximately 100%.
5 Discussion
Comparison with the model-independent method
For the representative model eq. (4.1), we derive the fluid profiles across and away from
the bubble wall for different hydrodynamic modes in the last section. The corresponding
kinetic energy fractions derived by our model-dependent method and the conventional model-
independent method are also shown in table 4. We compare and discuss the results as follows:
•Deflagration mode. According to the fluid profiles shown in figure 6 and the kinetic
energy fraction given in table 4, we find our method yields results that differ from the
conventional model-independent method. The difference could be attributed to two
reasons: the EoS and the treatment of the bubble wall. For the EoS, in the symmetric
phase, we have eq. (4.12) for our model-dependent method, whereas the bag model
gives the EoS as eq. (3.8) and the µνmodel gives the EoS as eq. (4.8). Compared with
the bag model and the µνmodel, the constant ϵis omitted in our method. Our EoS
of the representative model, the bag model and the µνmodel give a constant sound
speed cs,+= 1/√
3. Hence the EoS of the symmetric phase are basically the same for
the bag model, the µνmodel and our representative model. To derive the boundary
conditions of the deflagration mode, we need to deal with the shock front, which is
treated as a discontinuity in both methods. For the bubble wall, the conventional
model-independent method treats the bubble wall as a discontinuity, and the matching
conditions are obtained by neglecting the bubble wall. This is due to comparing to the
bubble radius, the bubble wall thickness is negligible, its contribution should be strongly
suppressed. While our model-dependent method need to solve the EoM of the scalar
field to derive the corresponding boundary conditions. To find the main source of the
discrepancies between our method and the conventional model independent methods,
we compare the results from those different methods.
For the deflagration mode of BP1, the boundary conditions of the fluid velocity and
temperature derived by our model-dependent method are ˜v+= 0.0034andT+/Tn=
1.0020respectively, while the boundary conditions derived by the model-independent
method based on thebag modelare ˜vbag

to the relative corrections of 14.706%and0.03%, respectively. And the boundary
conditions obtained by the model-independent method based on the µνmodel are ˜vµν
+=
0.0035andTµν
+/Tn= 1.00201, corresponding to the relative corrections of 2.941%and
0.000998% , respectively. For BP2, the boundary conditions derived by the model-
dependent method are ˜v+= 0.0069andT+/Tn= 1.0040, while the boundary conditions
– 22 –derived by the model-independent method are ˜vbag
+= 0.0077andTbag
+/Tn= 1.0045,
corresponding to relative corrections of 11.594%and0.05%, respectively. And the
boundary conditions obtained bythe model-independentmethod based onthe µνmodel
are˜vµν
+= 0.00695andTµν
+/Tn= 1.00402, corresponding to the relative corrections of
0.725%and0.00199%, respectively. For BP3, the boundary conditions derived by the
model-dependent method are ˜v+= 0.0219andT+/Tn= 1.0127, while the boundary
conditions derived by the model-independent method are ˜vbag
+= 0.0228andTbag
+/Tn=
1.0132, correspondingtorelativecorrectionsof 4.12%and0.049%, respectively. Andthe
boundary conditions obtained bythe model-independentmethod based onthe µνmodel
are˜vµν
+= 0.02193andTµν
+/Tn= 1.01274, corresponding to the relative corrections of
0.137%and0.039%, respectively. As we can see, the relative corrections of ˜v+decrease
as the strength of phase transitions increases, whereas the relative corrections of T+/Tn
are small and less affected by the strength of phase transitions. However, as the strength
of phase transition increases, the absolute differences between the boundary conditions
of the velocity and the temperature become larger.
Wefindtheconventionalmethodbasedonthe µνmodelalmostgivesthesameboundary
conditions as our model-dependent method. When compared with the bag model, the
difference arises from the different EoS of the broken phase used in the calculation.
Therefore, we can conclude that the boundary conditions are actually strongly affected
by the EoS of the broken phase, and the discrepancy between our method and the
conventional model-independent method are predominantly originated from different
EoS.
•Detonation mode. Forthedetonationmode, wefindthatthedifferencesoftheboundary
conditions and kinetic energy fraction are more significant according to figure 7 and
table 4. The discrepancies in the detonation mode might be also originated from the
EoS and the treatment of the bubble wall. The bag model of EoS in the broken phase
is given by eq. (3.9), and the µνmodel gives eq. (4.9), while the EoS derived directly by
the effective potential of the representative is shown in eq. (4.13), which are obviously
different. Thisdifferencescanbeobservedfromthethermalfunctioneq.(3.12). Thebag
model is equivalent to the leading order approximation of high-temperature expansion
of the thermal function. And the µνincorporated the higher order effect in a constant
sound speed that deviates from 1√
3. However, the EoS derived directly from the
effective potential preserves the high order corrections and is also capable of capturing
the temperature dependency of the sound speed. To confirm the dominant source of
discrepancies, we also perform the following comparison.
From our tests, the corresponding fluid profiles and kinetic energy fractions derived by
themodel-dependentmethodandthemodel-independentmethodconfirmthesignificant
differencesquantitatively. ForBP3, weset T+= 0.9Tctoderivethedetonationsolution,
and the corresponding strength parameter at this temperature is 0.14for the bag model
and 0.15 for the µνmodel. And the boundary conditions of the fluid velocity and
temperature derived by our model-dependent method are ˜v−= 0.1319andT−/T+=
1.114, while we have ˜vbag
−= 0.2213andTbag
−/T+= 1.1202for the model-independent
method based on the bag model, corresponding to relative corrections of 67.779%and
0.557%, respectively. For the model-independent method based on the µνmodel, ˜vµν
−=
0.1402andTµν
−/T+= 1.0737, corresponding to the relative corrections of 6.293%and
3.618%.
– 23 –In summary, for the detonation mode, we also find the conventional method based on
theµνmodel can yield boundary conditions that are close to our results within a few
percent. Whencomparingittothebagmodel, weconcludethatthemodificationmainly
comes from the different EoS of the broken phase. Consequently, the discrepancies are
predominantly originated from different EoS, and the contribution of the bubble wall is
negligible.
To summarize, our mode-dependent method is based on the effective potential of a spe-
cific particle physics model, and the EoS of the phase transition system is directly obtained
from the effective potential. This approach is capable of capturing the temperature depen-
dency of the sound speed of the plasma. Besides, the bubble wall is not simply treated as a
discontinuity, and the contribution of the scalar field to the energy-momentum tensor across
the bubble wall is taken into account, though the contribution of the bubble wall is strongly
suppressed and negligible. Meanwhile, since we need to solve the EoM of the scaler field in
our method, the bubble wall velocity and the boundary conditions of the fluid equations can
be derived simultaneously. In contrast, the conventional model-independent method relies on
matching the particle physics model to a specific model of EoS, usually failing to consider the
temperature dependency of the sound speed. In addition, the EoS model employed in the
model-independent method may neglect the effect higher order corrections. Hence, it should
be less accurate compared to our model-dependent analysis. Indeed, the difference could be
significant in some cases. For example, compared with our model-dependent method, for
the kinetic fraction, the relative corrections of the model-independent method based on the
bag mode are around 300% and 10%−30%for the detonation and the deflagration mode,
respectively. Since the EoS in the symmetric phase is similar to the bag model, the differ-
ence is less significant in the deflagration mode. Our mode-dependent calculations also show
that both the detonation and deflagration modes heat the fluid deep inside bubbles, whereas
the conventional model-independent method always shows that the temperature deep inside
bubbles is lower than the temperature far in front of the bubble wall. Moreover, the number
of degrees of freedom should be different in the symmetric phase and the broken phase, since
particles obtain mass in the broken phase. For the conventional model-independent method,
we can change the value of ain the bag model to incorporate this effect, while in our model-
dependent method, an additional differential equation [34, 35, 43] T∂µ(suµ) =η(uµ∂µϕ)2
should be considered to take this effect into account. Further study of this topic is planned
as future work. In addition, to reduce the theoretical uncertainties introduced by different
forms of the friction terms in eq. (2.11), we can actually substitute the Boltzmann equa-
tion into the calculation of profiles across the wall and the bubble wall velocity, as shown in
refs [31, 50, 54–62]. And the corresponding improvement of our model-dependent method is
in progress.
Effects of bubble geometry
To simplify the calculation, we often insert some specific symmetries for the bubbles [23, 39],
e.g., planar, cylindrical, and spherical symmetries. In this work, we assume that the local
EoM across the bubble wall has a planar symmetry. We then derive the planer fluid profiles
with boundary conditions given by the local EoM across the bubble wall. However, different
geometries should give different fluid profiles, and ref. [23] shows that the geometry can
give modifications to the kinetic energy fraction of the FOPT. Based on the bag model of
EoS, ref. [23] studies the effect of bubble geometry using the conventional model-independent

method, and they find that the planar case always make the value of kinetic energy fraction
larger than the spherical case for the deflagration mode. However, for the detonation mode,
the differences between the planar case and the spherical case are negligibly small. Since the
thickness of the fluid shell is comparable to the bubble radius, the planar approximation of
the fluid shell may not be appropriate. As suggested in ref. [36–38], one may use the planer
bubble wall to give boundary conditions of the fluid profile, while keeping the sphericity of the
fluid profiles. Following this way, one can get spherical fluid profiles, as shown in figure 8. A
comparison of the fluid profiles derived by our model-dependent method and the conventional
model-independent method based on the bag model and the µνmodel is also given in this
figure. These results can serve as an approximation for the spherical fluid profile. However,
to get more precise results for the spherical bubble, the local spherical EoM across the bubble
wall at steady-state stage needs to be solved, and we leave that to our future study.
6 Conclusion
In this work, we have proposed a model-dependent method to calculate the energy budget of
the cosmological FOPT. Taking a representative model as an example, we have illustrated the
calculationofthekineticenergyfractionwithourmethod. BysolvingthelocalEoMacrossthe
bubble wall, we can simultaneously derive the bubble wall velocity and the boundary condi-
tions of the fluid equations. Comparing our results with the conventional model-independent
method, we have found there are significant differences in the detonation mode. For the defla-
gration mode, the differences in the results derived by both methods are less significant. The
origins of these discrepancies are attributed to different EoS and the contribution of the scalar
– 25 –field to the energy-momentum tensor across the bubble wall. Our model-dependent method
gives a more realistic EoS, which is directly derived from the effective potential, and it takes
into account the contribution of the scalar field to the energy-momentum tensor. Hence, our
method in principle gives more precise results for the energy budget and the prediction of
phase transition GWs, and it could be directly used in other well-motivated particle physics
models.
