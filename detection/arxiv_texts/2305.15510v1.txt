1 INTRODUCTION
Characterising the history of cosmic star formation and understand-
ingthedriversofstarformationingalaxiesfromhightolowredshift
have been fundamental goals of extragalactic research for several
decades (see Madau & Dickinson 2014, for a thorough review).
Earlyhigh-redshiftsurveyspresentedabroadviewofstarformation
overcosmictime,withthevolume-averagedstarformationrateden-
sity(SFRD)increasingfromhighredshifttopeaksomewhereinthe
range 1≲𝑧≲2.5and then declining towards the present day (Lilly
etal.1995,1996;Madauetal.1996;Connollyetal.1997;Pascarelle
etal.1998).Bythemid-2000s,theSFRDhadbeenconstrainedfairly
tightly back to 𝑧∼1, using a range of tracers (Hopkins & Beacom
2006; Wilkins et al. 2008). However, its form at higher redshift and
the exact position of the peak remained less well determined.
Since then, numerous studies have attempted to constrain the
SFRD more tightly, particularly at higher redshifts, and ultraviolet
★E-mail: rcochrane@flatironinstitute.org(UV) studies have probed unobscured star formation back to 𝑧∼10
(e.g. Bowler et al. 2015, 2017; Bouwens et al. 2015; Oesch et al.
2018; Bouwens et al. 2019) and beyond (e.g. Donnan et al. 2023).
This is motivated, in part, by the need for better constraints on the
physics of reionization; at 𝑧 > 5, the SFRD determines the con-
tribution of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) to the budget of ionizing
photons (see the review by Stark 2016). However, galaxy selections
based on unobscured emission (e.g. using the Lyman break or Ly-
man alpha emission line) are biased towards galaxies that are both
young and fairly dust poor (Shibuya 2020), and substantial correc-
tionsarerequiredtoscaletheUV-derivedSFRDandbringitintoline
with infrared (IR)-derived values where the two overlap (at 𝑧 <3;
Madau & Dickinson 2014). Such corrections are subject to consid-
erable uncertainties on the degree of dust obscuration in galaxies.
ThisisparticularlyunconstrainedintheearlyUniverse(seeMaetal.
2019, and references therein), and possibly underestimated: recent
ALMA observations of the dust continuum emission from Lyman
Break Galaxies suggests that individual galaxies as distant as 𝑧∼8
canharboursignificantamountsofdust(Watsonetal.2015;Laporte

etal.2017;Bowleretal.2018).Therearemethodsofestimatingdust
correctionsfromUVobservationsalone,primarilyviatheempirical
IRX−𝛽relation between the ratio of the infrared luminosity to UV
luminosity, IRX, and the UV spectral slope, 𝛽(Meurer et al. 1999).
However, the considerable scatter in the relation, due to complex
geometries, older stellar populations and different intrinsic extinc-
tion curves (see Popping et al. 2017; Narayanan et al. 2018), add
uncertainty to such corrections. Cosmic variance is also a concern
for rest-frame UV studies of the highest redshift galaxies (Trenti &
Stiavelli2008;Driver&Robotham2010;Ventouetal.2017),asthe
depth needed to find these faint objects often comes at the expense
of area.
An alternative tracer of star formation is rest-frame far-infrared
(FIR) emission; since this is driven by the thermal output of dust
heated by young stars, it is used to quantify star formation that is
missed by the UV. This is particularly critical around the peak of
cosmic star formation ( 𝑧∼1−3), where∼85per cent of the total
starformationisobscured(Dunlopetal.2017).Whilethelargearea
surveysenabledby Herschel andtheSouthPoleTelescopehavedis-
covered some extreme sources as distant as 𝑧∼7(e.g. Weiss et al.
2013; Strandet et al. 2017; Marrone et al. 2018; Casey et al. 2019),
deepersurveysthathavethesensitivitytodetectmoretypicalsources
tend to be limited to small areas of sky (e.g. Aravena et al. 2016;
Hatsukadeetal.2016;Dunlopetal.2017;Francoetal.2018).Since
the redshift distribution of SMGs observed at ∼1 mmpeaks around
𝑧=2.0−2.5(Chapmanetal.2005;Koprowskietal.2014;Simpson
et al. 2014; Danielson et al. 2017; Stach et al. 2019), constraints on
the abundance of dusty sources and their contribution to the SFRD
at𝑧 > 4are few, due to the lack of detected sources (Casey et al.
2018). Recent work has shown the promise of untargeted, longer
wavelengthsurveysinisolatinghigherredshiftsources(Zavalaetal.
2021; Casey et al. 2021; Cooper et al. 2021; Manning et al. 2022).
Zavala et al. (2021) present a large (for mm), 184 arcmin2,2 mm
survey, from which they identify 13sources. Combining their new
datawithanempirically-basedmodel,theyshowthatdust-obscured
star formation dominates the cosmic star formation rate budget to
𝑧=4, dropping to a 35per cent contribution at 𝑧=5, and 20−25
per cent at𝑧=6−7(broadly in line with Dunlop et al. 2017 and
Bouwens et al. 2020).
ThesmallfieldofviewimagedinasingleALMApointingmakes
extending untargeted sub-millimeter surveys to degree scales tech-
nically challenging (Chen et al. 2023). However, building samples
of robustly-characterised star-forming galaxies is critical in order to
answerkeyquestionsingalaxyevolution.Theseincludeunderstand-
ing the timing and drivers of cessation of star-formation in different
types of galaxies, which is fundamentally linked to a robust mea-
surement of the cosmic star formation rate density as a function of
redshift.Wewouldalsoliketobeabletoconstrainbettertheamount

andhowthisvariesacrossthegalaxypopulation.Thisrequireslarge
statistical samples that span a broad range of cosmic time (i.e. from
𝑧∼0to well beyond the peak of cosmic star formation), as well as
wide fields to overcome cosmic variance.
Thenewgenerationofradiointerferometersofferauniqueoppor-
tunity to provide such samples and resolve these issues. Unlike at

trons spiralling in weak magnetic fields emit synchotron radiation,

to radio correlation (FIRC), which has been shown by many to hold
over several orders of magnitude in radio luminosity (e.g. van der
Kruit 1971; Ivison et al. 2010; Sargent et al. 2010; Bourne et al.
2011;Delhaizeetal.2017;Readetal.2018;McCheyneetal.2021).
The sensitive,dust-independent natureof radiocontinuum emission
as a star-formation rate tracer has been capitalised on by previous
workestimatingthestar-formationhistory(e.g.Haarsmaetal.2000;
Seymour et al. 2008), including the detailed studies made possible
byVLAobservationsoftheCOSMOSfield(Schinnereretal.2007;
Sargent et al. 2010; Schinnerer et al. 2010; Delhaize et al. 2017;
Novak et al. 2017; Smolčić et al. 2017; Leslie et al. 2020; Van der
Vlugt et al. 2021). One key advantage of the radio is its ability to
probestarformationandAGNactivityinbothlocalandverydistant
galaxies(radio-loudsourceshavebeendiscoveredatredshiftsashigh
as𝑧=6.82;McGreeretal.2006;Saxenaetal.2018;Belladittaetal.
2020;Banadosetal.2021;Ighinaetal.2021).However,toprobethe
bulk of the star-forming population, we need highly sensitive obser-
vations, and the deepest radio surveys typically cover limited areas
of sky ( 2 deg2in the case of VLA-COSMOS).
Censusstudiesarenowbecomingfeasiblewiththecurrentgener-
ation of radio telescopes, which can map large sky areas with high
sensitivity and good angular resolution in an efficient manner. The
International Low Frequency Array (LOFAR; Van Haarlem 2013),
isalargearrayofradioantennas,centredintheNetherlandsbutwith
antennastationsaroundEurope.Thelargeprimarybeam(full-width
at half-maximum 3.8 deg2for stations in the Netherlands) enables
10 deg2regionsofskytobemappedinasinglepointing.Makinguse
of this, the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS; Shimwell et al.
2017, 2019, 2022) project is adopting a multi-pronged approach to
surveying the Northern sky at radio wavelengths. One strand of this
is a wide-field survey of the whole Northern sky at 120−168 MHz
and∼6′′angular resolution (see Shimwell et al. 2017, 2019, 2022;
Duncan et al. 2019; Williams et al. 2019). The second strand is a
series of deep-field pointings known as the LoTSS Deep Fields.
The LoTSS Deep Fields currently comprise deep observations of
threewell-studiedNorthernextragalacticfields:theEuropeanLarge-
Area ISO Survey-North 1 (Elais-N1; Kessler et al. 1996; Oliver
et al. 2000), Boötes (Jannuzi & Dey 1999) and the Lockman Hole
(Lockman et al. 1986), which are expected to reach eventual depths
of∼10𝜇Jy/beamrms (Best et al. 2023). The first data release of
these Deep Fields data reach ∼20𝜇Jy/beamat150 MHz1(Duncan
et al. 2021; Kondapally et al. 2021; Tasse et al. 2021; Sabater et al.
2021). The radio imaging has been accompanied by a detailed pro-
gramme of source association and cross-identification (Kondapally
et al. 2021), photometric redshift estimation (Duncan et al. 2021)
and host galaxy characterisation (Best et al. 2023). In this paper, we
perform a detailed study of the radio view of cosmic star formation
usingthethreeLOFARDeepFields,Elais-N1,BoötesandtheLock-
man Hole. The sensitivity of our observations is comparable to that
of the 3 GHzCOSMOS-VLA survey (this reached 2.3𝜇Jy/beam,
which is equivalent to ∼19𝜇Jy/beamat150 MHz, assuming a ra-
diospectralindexof −0.7).Ourdatacoverasubstantiallylargerarea

2 THE DATA: PANCHROMATIC OBSERVATIONS OF
ELAIS-N1, BOÖTES AND THE LOCKMAN HOLE
In this section, we present an overview of the LOFAR 150 MHz
observations as well as the cross-matched UV-FIR photometric cat-
alogues used in this work.
2.1 Radio observations with LOFAR
Elais-N1, Boötes and the Lockman Hole were observed by LOFAR
at150 MHz frequency with the HBA (high-band antenna) array, in
aseriesof 8-hourpointings.ObservationsofElais-N1(phasecenter
16h11m00s +55 °00’00”; J2000) took place as part of cycles 0, 2 &
4, with 164 hrof integration time in total. Observations of Boötes
(phase center 14h32m00s +34 °30’00”) were taken in cycles 3 & 8,
with 80 hrof integration time in total. The Lockman Hole (phase
center10h47m00s+58 °05’00”)wasobservedincycles3&10,with
integration time summing to 112 hr. All three fields were calibrated
andimagedusingNetherlands-onlybaselines,whichgivesrisetoan
angular resolution of 6′′(note that imaging using international sta-
tionsisalsopossible;seeJacksonetal.2022;Morabitoetal.2022b;
Sweĳen et al. 2022). The rms sensitivity reached at the pointing
centre was 20𝜇Jy/beamfor Elais-N1, 32𝜇Jy/beamfor Boötes and
22𝜇Jy/beamfor the Lockman Hole. Sensitivity decreases further
from the pointing center; for each field, the area enclosed by the 30
per cent power point is ∼25 deg2. A full description of these ob-
servationsandtheradiodatareductionprocessispresentedinTasse
et al. (2021) and Sabater et al. (2021).
RadiosourceextractionwasperformedontheStokesIradioimage
using the Python Blob Detector and Source Finder (PyBDSF; Mo-
han & Rafferty 2015). The final radio catalogue comprises 84,862
sources in Elais-N1, 36,767sources in Boötes, and 50,112sources
intheLockmanHole(Sabateretal.2021;Tasseetal.2021).Asdis-
cussed in the following section, we use a subset of these sources in
thefollowinganalysis,limitingthesampletoradio-identifiedsources

2.2.1 Ultraviolet and optical data
In all three fields, near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) data ( 𝜆eff=
1350&2800Å) are provided by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer
(GALEX) space telescope (Deep Imaging Survey data release 6 &
7; Martin et al. 2005; Morrissey et al. 2007).

scope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) 1 survey (PS1;
Chambers et al. 2016). Further optical imaging from the Hyper-
Suprime-Cam (HSC; Aihara et al. 2018) survey covers the United
Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Infrared Deep Sky Survey
(UKIDSS) Deep Extragalactic Survey (DXS) footprint (Lawrence
etal.2007;seebelow)withthebroad-bandfilters 𝐺,𝑅,𝐼,𝑍&𝑌,as
well as the narrow-band filter NB921. In Boötes, deep optical pho-
tometry in the 𝐵𝑊,𝑅and𝐼bands is drawn from the NOAO Deep
WideField Survey(NDWFS; Jannuzi& Dey1999), withadditional
𝑧-band data from the zBoötes survey (Cool 2007) and additional
𝑈specand𝑌-bandimagingfromtheLargeBinocularTelescope(Bian

whichcovers 2.4 deg2ofElais-N1and 5.6 deg2intheLockmanHole,

WFS; Ashby et al. 2009), with additional data from the Decadal
IRAC Boötes Survey (M.L.N. Ashby PI, PID 10088).
24𝜇mdata are provided by Spitzer-MIPS (Rieke et al. 2004);
for Elais-N1 and the Lockman Hole, the data were drawn from the
SWIRE survey. At longer FIR wavelengths, data for all three fields
were drawn from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey
(HerMES;Oliveretal.2012),whichusedthe Herschel SpaceObser-
vatory(Pilbrattetal.2010). Herschel imagingat 100𝜇mand160𝜇m

2.2.3 Multi-wavelength catalogues
The ultraviolet to mid-IR flux densities described above are com-
piledintheforced-andmatched-aperture,aperture-corrected,multi-
wavelength catalogues presented by Kondapally et al. (2021).
Sourceswereidentifiedoncombinedchi-squaredstackimages;those
withsignal-to-noiseratio(SNR)lessthan3inallfilterswereremoved
from the catalogues.
FulldetailsoftheFIRcataloguesareprovidedinMcCheyneetal.
(2021), so we provide only a summary here. For all fields, FIR flux
densities derived by the Herschel Legacy Project (HELP; Shirley
et al. 2021) provided the basis of our measurements. As part of
HELP, source deblending was performed using the Bayesian tool
XID+ (Hurley et al. 2017). Where a LOFAR source could be cross-
matchedwithaHELPcatalogueentrywithin 0.5′′,theHELPfluxes
were adopted. Where a LOFAR source had no HELP match, XID+
wasre-runwiththeradiohostgalaxypositionaddedtothepriorlist.
2.3 A cross-matched radio and photometric catalogue
Full details of the cross-matching of radio-identified sources to the
photometric catalogues summarised in Section 2.2 are provided in
Kondapallyetal.(2021).AtthedepthsreachedbytheLOFARimag-
ing in the Deep Fields, radio emission from multiple sources can
be incorrectly linked by the PyBDSF source extraction procedure,
leading to ‘blended sources’. The opposite scenario, extended emis-
sion from individual sources being split up into many components,
canalsooccur.Inthissection,wesummarisetheapproachemployed
to associate radio and multi-wavelength sources within the LOFAR
Deep Fields. This was only performed over the area of sky with the
bestmulti-wavelengthdata: ∼6.74 deg2inElais-N1,∼8.63 deg2in
Boötes, and∼10.28 deg2in the Lockman Hole.
The likelihood ratio (LR) method (de Ruiter et al. 1977; Suther-
land & Saunders 1992) uses magnitude and colour information to
match radio sources with their optical and IR counterparts, as de-
scribed in Kondapally et al. (2021). This technique yields robust
associations for the majority of radio sources ( 80−85per cent of
sources in each field). For sources with extended or complex radio
emission,sourceswerevisuallyinspectedusingLOFARGalaxyZoo
(LGZ; see also Williams et al. 2019 for an earlier use of the same
framework), a private Zooniverse project accessible to members of
theLOFARconsortium.Othersources,primarilythosethatwerepo-
tential radio blends, were sent for identification by an ‘expert user’,
who de-blended the PyBDSF source using the PyBDSF Gaussian
components.

radio-detected sources. After cross-matching to optical/NIR coun-
terparts and the flagging of spurious sources, there were 30,839

in Boötes, there are 1,911,929optically-detected sources, 19,179

etal.(2021), 2−3percentofsources( 771inElais-N1, 600inBoötes,
and760intheLockmanHole)havenorobustoptical/NIRID.Someof these sources have FIR counterparts, and are likely dusty AGN
and SFGs. Note that Novak et al. (2017) reported that ∼4per cent
of VLA-COSMOS sources are optically faint shortward of 𝑖-band
for a similar radio-selected population. NIR/optically-dark sources
have also been reported as common in sub-millimeter selected sam-
ples (e.g. Simpson et al. 2014, 2017;Franco et al. 2018; Wang et al.
2019;Dudzeviciuteetal.2020;Smailetal.2021).Kondapallyetal.
(2021) investigated the LOFAR-detected radio sources without IDs,
and found that these are likely dominated by 𝑧∼2−4AGN. Since
we focus on star forming galaxies in this paper, they are unlikely to
have much effect on our analysis.
2.4 Deriving photometric redshifts of LOFAR-identified
sources
Theprocessofderivingphotometricredshiftsforsourcesinallthree
fields is described fully in Duncan et al. (2021) and we review only
the most important details here. Both template fitting and machine
learning techniques were used to derive photometric redshifts for
both the radio-selected LOFAR sources, and the full optical cata-
logue (∼5million sources in total). This ‘hybrid’ approach was
shown by Duncan et al. (2018b) to improve upon traditional tem-
plate fitting, particularly for intermediate redshift AGN, which had
provedachallengingpopulationtoobtainredshiftsfor(Duncanetal.
2018a). Duncan et al. (2021) showed that outlier fractions, defined
as|𝑧phot−𝑧spec|/(1+𝑧spec)>0.15, range from 1.5to1.8per cent
for galaxies, and from 18to22per cent for optical, IR and X-ray
selectedAGN.Inthispaper,wemakeuseofthephotometricredshift
posteriorsforsourceswithoutspectroscopicredshifts(thisisthema-
jority; only∼8.6per cent of all LoTSS Deep Fields radio sources
havespectroscopicredshifts).SinceweexcludethemajorityofAGN
fromouranalysis,theseredshiftsarereasonablyrobust( ≲2percent
outlier fractions).
2.5 Classification of star-forming galaxies and AGN
Reliable classifications of star-forming sources and AGN are essen-
tial for this study. Best et al. (2023) present the multiple methods
used to identify AGN from emission in different wavebands, which
we summarise here. A combination of spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting codes was used to identify the majority of radiative-
mode AGN (i.e. those identifiable via their optical/IR/X-ray emis-
sion).Eachradio-identifiedsourcewasfittedwithfourdifferentSED
fitting codes: MAGPHYS (da Cunha et al. 2008), BAGPIPES (Carnall
etal.2018,2019), AGNfitter(CalistroRiveraetal.2016),and CIGALE

Million Quasar catalogue, which is mainly based on the Sloan Dig-
ital Sky Survey (Alam et al. 2015). X-ray AGN (defined by X-ray-
to-optical flux ratios or hardness ratios) were identified in Boötes
thanks to the deep X-ray data provided by Chandra, as part of the
X-Boötes survey of NDWFS (Kenter et al. 2005). In Elais-N1 and
theLockmanHole,theSecond ROSATAll-SkySurvey(Bolleretal.
2016)andthe XMM-Newton Surveyprovideshallowerdata,enabling
the identification of brighter X-ray sources.
Radio-selected AGN were identified based on their excess emis-
sion at 150 MHz. For each source, the radio emission expected for a
purely star-forming source with a given SED-derived SFR (see Sec-
tion2.6)wasdeterminedusingthe‘ridgeline’relationbetweenSFR
and𝐿150 MHzderived by Best et al. (2023); note that the ‘ridgeline’
agrees well with the relation derived by Smith et al. (2021). Then,
excess radio emission relative to this expected value was calculated.
Sourcesthatwereeitheroffsetfromtherelationbymorethan 0.7 dex,
or had extended ( >80 kpc) radio emission, are likely not powered
solely by star formation, and were hence classified as radio-selected
AGN.
In our final classifications, star-forming galaxies were defined as
those without AGN signatures in optical/IR/X-ray, and without ex-
cess radio emission. Sources with excess radio emission form the
radio-loud AGN classes. In this paper, we focus on galaxies without
radio excess, i.e. galaxies classified as either star-forming or radio-
quietAGN.Thesecomprise 77%ofthetotalLoTSSsample( 81%of
sources with optical/NIR counterparts and classifications; see Best
et al. 2023). For the radio-quiet AGN, star-formation is expected
to drive the majority of the radio continuum emission detected by
LOFAR (though there will be a minority of cases where a weak jet
dominates; see Macfarlane et al. 2021 for a model of quasar radio
luminosity that comprises contribution from star formation and an
AGNjet.Theyconcludedthatthejet-launchingmechanismoperates
in all quasars, but with different efficiency. See also Gürkan et al.
2019).
Our final sample comprises 55,581radio sources within the red-
shift range 0.1< 𝑧 < 5.7for which radio emission is dominated
by star formation. 21,638of these are in Elais-N1, 12,787are in
Boötes, and 21,156are in the Lockman Hole.2.6 Stellar masses and star formation rates for star-forming
galaxies
As noted in Section 2.5, four different SED fitting codes are used
to fit all radio-selected sources. SED fitting provides an alternative
waytoestimategalaxySFRs,comparedwithsinglewavelengthflux
calibrations. ‘Energy balance’ based SED fitting ensures that the
unobscured and obscured components of galaxy emission are fitted
simultaneously and self-consistently with a combination of simple
stellar populations, a dust model, and models of star formation his-
tory and galactic chemical evolution. Physical parameters may then
bederivedfromthebest-fittingcombinationofmodels.Thesecodes
havebeentestedonsimulatedgalaxies(e.g.Hayward&Smith2014;
Dudzeviciute et al. 2020). Each of the four SED fitting codes pro-
vides estimates for the physical properties of the sources, including
stellar mass and star-formation rates. Best et al. (2023) describe the
processbywhichtheseSEDfittingoutputsarecombinedtogenerate
‘consensus’ estimates.
For all sources that were not classified as radiative-mode AGN,
stellarmassandSFRwerebothgenerallycalculatedusingthemeanof
thelogarithmofthevaluesderivedusing MAGPHYS andBAGPIPES ,
providing both codes yielded a statistically acceptable fit (note that
this was the case for ∼90per cent of these sources). Where one fit
was unacceptable, the estimate from the acceptable fit was adopted.
For the radio-quiet AGN in our sample, stellar masses and SFRs
were derived using more appropriate SED fitting techniques, which
included a component of emission from the AGN. For the vast ma-
jorityofthese( >94percent),stellarmassesandSFRswerederived
usingCIGALE(seeBestetal.2023forfulldetailsofthesmallnum-
ber of cases where AGNfitter was preferred).
The distributions of 150 MHz luminosity, star formation rate and
stellarmass,forourselectedpopulationofstar-forminggalaxiesand
radio-quiet AGN, are shown in Figure 1.
3 THE RADIO LUMINOSITY FUNCTION OF
STAR-FORMING GALAXIES
3.1 Constructing the 150 MHz luminosity function
With our sample of star-forming galaxies and radio-quiet AGN in-
hand, we construct 150 MHz luminosity functions at a range of red-
shifts. Approximately 90per cent of the radio sources in our sam-
ple are classified as ‘pure’ SFGs, but we include radio-quiet AGN

to perform a complete census of star formation (see also Bonato
etal.2021,whoconstructradioluminosityfunctionsfortheseparate
populations). Rest-frame 150 MHz luminosities are calculated us-
ingthefollowingformula,where 𝜈istheobserved-framefrequency,
150 MHz,𝛼is the radio spectral index (we assume 𝛼=−0.7), and
𝑆𝜈is the flux density at the observed frequency. 𝑧is the source red-
shift (we use the spectroscopic redshift, if it exists, and if not, the
photometric redshift, as described in Section 2.4), and 𝐷𝐿is the
corresponding luminosity distance:

the sources into eleven wide redshift bins. We place the observed
LOFAR sources into these redshift bins, and calculate a rest-frame

redshift bin (with edges 𝑧minand𝑧max) into narrow redshift slices
of sizeΔ(𝑧)=0.0001. For each narrow redshift slice, we calculate
the150 MHz flux density that we would observe if the source were
locatedatthecentreofthatredshiftslice(usingitsknownrest-frame

(such as aliasing) in the photometric redshifts, as derived in Section
3.3.Thisenablesustofoldinthespatially-varyingradiodepthsover

Repeating the process for each of the wide redshift bins enables
us to construct luminosity functions from 𝑧∼0to𝑧∼5.
3.2 Radio completeness corrections
Completeness was calculated as a function of source flux density
by simulating the source detection rate using the same techniques
used to identify real sources. Approximately 100,000mock Gaus-

each of the three LoTSS Deep Fields. As described in Section 3.2,
the completeness curves were calculated using source extraction of
mock input sources from the radio images, using the same PyBDSF
parametersaswereusedfortheextractionofrealsources.Arealistic
source size distribution was applied, based on the observed size
distribution of star-forming galaxies with flux densities in the range
1−5 mJy, where completeness is high. As expected based on total
observing times, Elais-N1 has the deepest radio coverage, followed
bytheLockmanHole,andthenBoötes.Notethatduetoaverysmall

otherinjectedsources,thecompletenessneverquitereaches100per

flux density were placed into regions of the LOFAR image that are
covered by the optical imaging (accounting for masked regions). In
practice, we insert 1,000mock sources at a time, a small number
compared to the number of real sources in the LOFAR image, and
repeat∼1,000times; this is to avoid bias due to confusion. We
usedacontinuousdistributionofgalaxymajoraxissize(from 6′′to
30′′), and flux density (from 0.1 mJyto40 mJy). For each source,
minor axis size was drawn from the distribution of minor axes of

sourcewasseparatedfromneighboursbyatleasttwiceitsmajoraxis

to be ‘recovered’ if PyBDSF identified a source with flux density
greater than 5𝜎of the local rms, within 2′′of the position of the

not to use only the very brightest sources, which will be biased in

to the calibration). The size distribution of star-forming sources at

within each redshift bin studied was then compared to the number

regions are derived using 10,000bootstrapped samples. We apply
these corrections to the number densities derived for each field, up
to and including the 𝑧=2.5−3.3bin. At higher redshifts, these
corrections become less reliable due to long tails of photometric
redshift probability distributions that peak at lower redshift. Hence,
we do not apply corrections at 𝑧>3.3.

completeness curve, for each field (see Figure 2) and provide these
in Table A1. The 50per cent completeness values are 128𝜇Jyfor
Elais-N1, 246𝜇Jyfor Boötes, and 180𝜇Jyfor the Lockman Hole.
Equivalent curves were also derived assuming a source-size distri-
bution appropriate for AGN, and are presented in (Kondapally et al.
2022).
Radio completeness corrections were applied when constructing
luminosity functions, as described in Section 3.1. We discard lumi-
nositybinswhereapplyingthederivedradiocompletenesscorrection
results in a change of >0.5 dex.
3.3 Incorporating uncertainties in photometric redshifts
When deriving luminosity functions, the redshift used for each
source,𝑧BEST, was the spectroscopic redshift where available, or
otherwise the median of the primary photometric redshift solution.
As discussed in Section 2.4, the derivation of these redshifts com-
bines template fitting and machine learning techniques, which yield
particularly reliable results for the star-forming galaxies studied in
this paper. However, as seen in Figure 1, there is a dip in galaxy
numbers at𝑧∼1.5, which may be driven by uncertainties in photo-
metric redshifts. This effect is particularly marked in Elais-N1 and
the Lockman Hole, which lack 𝐻-band data. The 𝐻-band is impor-
tant in characterising the observed-frame wavelength of the 4000Å
break;forgalaxiesinthewavelengthrange 1.3<𝑧< 2.0,the 4000Å
break falls between the 𝑧-band and the 𝐽-band. For these sources,
𝐻-band data constrains the flatter spectrum above the break, and
hence enables more accurate redshifts to be derived. In the absence
of the𝐻-band, some photometric redshift aliasing can occur, anduncertainties on the derived photometric redshifts are larger. Here,
wecharacterisetheimpactoftheseuncertaintiesonderivednumber
densities in each of the three fields.
Fullycorrectingfortheuncertaintiesinphotometricredshiftsand
their impact on the derived luminosity function would be complex.
Assuming that the photometric redshift probability distribution of
each source is robust, we could sample this finely and repeat the
multi-code SED fitting, source classification and determination of a
consensus SFR at each redshift for each source. When constructing
the luminosity function, we could then draw bootstrapped samples,
withtheredshiftsofeachsourcedrawnfromitsphotometricredshift
distribution. Given the substantial effort and computational expense
required to derive source properties given just the best estimate red-
shift (see Best et al. 2023), this would be impractical. There is also
little evidence that the photometric redshift uncertainties are depen-
dentontheradioluminosityofthesource(whichcouldrequireusto
apply a luminosity-dependent correction). Instead we aim to take a
simpler approach that will provide an approximate correction factor
to the entire LF at each redshift for each field, 𝐶photometric(𝑧). This
method accounts for aliasing in the photometric redshifts, under the
assumptionthattherearenoradioluminosity-dependenteffects,and
that source classifications and physical properties are not systemati-
cally changed by redshift errors.
Our approach involves perturbing the redshift of each source ac-
cording to its photometric redshift distribution, and calculating the
changeinnumbersofgalaxiesthatfallwithineachredshiftbinstud-
ied. Instead of assuming 𝑧TRUE=𝑧BEST, we draw a photometric
redshift for each source from a flat redshift distribution between its
𝑧1,MINand𝑧1,MAX. We then compare the new number of sources
withineachredshiftbintothenumberofsourceswithinthebinthat
is derived using 𝑧BEST. We repeat this process 10,000times, using
differentrandomvaluesbetween 𝑧1,MINand𝑧1,MAX.Thisenablesus
toderivecorrectionfactorstothenumberdensitiesofsourceswithin
each field and redshift range, as shown in Figure 3 and tabulated
in Table B1. While most redshift bins have corrections ∼1(i.e. no
net gain or loss of sources, as the same number of sources are scat-
tered into a given redshift bin as out of it), we see larger corrections
required for Elais-N1 and the Lockman Hole (the fields that lack
𝐻-banddata)at 𝑧∼1.5.Moresourcesgetcorrectedintothe 𝑧∼1.5
redshift bin than out of it; this is because sources have 𝑧BESTvalues
thatarepushedtohigher/lowerredshifts,butwithlargeuncertainties
that cover the 𝑧∼1.5bin. This leads to an upward correction to the
luminosity function of ∼50per cent for Elais-N1 and the Lockman
Hole at𝑧∼1.5, with corresponding decreases for the neighbouring
higher and lower redshift bins. We apply the derived corrections (as
a multiplicative factor to 𝜙) up to and including the 𝑧=2.5−3.3
bin.Athigherredshifts,thesecorrectionsbecomelessreliabledueto
long tails of photometric redshift probability distributions that peak
at lower redshift and are therefore not applied.

radio-selected AGN in the three LoTSS Deep Fields as a function
of redshift. Their 𝑧=0.03−0.3measurement is plotted here. We
note the very different shapes of the luminosity functions for the
two populations. As expected, AGN dominate the source counts at
the highest luminosities. At 𝐿150 MHz∼1023.75W Hz−1, there are
approximately equal contributions of AGN and SFGs to the source
counts. We also show luminosity functions constructed for the star-
forming galaxy population by Best & Heckman (2012) and Sabater

thelackofradiocompletenesscorrectionsintheearlierwork.Differ-
ing redshift distributions of the samples will also contribute: for our
sample,themedianredshiftofsourcesincludedinthe 𝑧=0.03−0.3
subsample is 𝑧median=0.20. The median redshift of star-forming
sources using in both Best & Heckman (2012) and Sabater et al.
(2019) will be lower, due to less sensitive radio imaging. Coupled
withthestrongredshiftevolutionseenforthesesamples(seeFigure

functions.

4 RELIABLE CONVERSION OF 𝐿150MHZTO SFR
4.1 The star formation rate function constructed using
different SFR estimates
In this section, we derive the star formation rate function (SFRF)
using multiple SFR estimates. In principle, we can transform the
radio LFs to SFRFs using a previously-calibrated relation between
150 MHz radio luminosity and SFR (Calistro Rivera et al. 2017;
Gürkan et al. 2018; Smith et al. 2021). Smith et al. (2021) derived
the following relation using LOFAR data in EN1, using MAGPHYS -
derived SFRs for radio and NIR-selected sources at 𝑧<1:
log10(𝐿150MHz/W Hz−1)=(22.221±0.008)+
(1.058±0.007)log10(SFR/M⊙yr−1).(6)
A consistent relation was derived using the ‘ridgeline’ approach of
Best et al. (2023), and we confirm that re-fitting SFR as a function
of𝐿150MHz(as opposed to 𝐿150MHzas a function of SFR) gives a
similar result. We therefore use the Smith et al. (2021) relation to
derive SFR functions, essentially scaled luminosity functions; these
are plotted in red in Figure 8. Although the uncertainties on the
best-fitting parameters are small, Smith et al. (2021) showed that
there was substantial intrinsic scatter on the relation ( ∼0.3 dex) at
SFR=10−100 M⊙yr−1.
Adding an additional parameter such as stellar mass can decrease
the scatter on this relation. Using shallower LOFAR data in the
Herschel-ATLAS NGP field, and focusing on star-forming galaxies

the luminosity function are from the Boötes field alone, due to the larger photometric uncertainties in Elais-N1 and the Lockman Hole (see

They speculated that this may be due to alternative mechanisms for

We construct an SFR function using SFR estimates derived from
both𝐿150MHzandstellarmassasfollows.Foreachgalaxy,weinput
the ‘consensus’ stellar mass estimate provided by Best et al. (2023)
and the radio luminosity into Equation 7 to obtain a new SFR es-

luminosity function, applying radio luminosity and photometric un-
certainty corrections on a source-by-source basis. We overlay the
SFR function derived for each redshift bin in yellow in Figure 8.

without stellar mass only at very high SFRs and at redshifts beyond

lines). As seen most clearly at low redshifts, below the break of the
function ( SFR★), the SFRF estimates are in reasonable agreement.
However, they can differ substantially at the highest SFRs, in some
cases by an order of magnitude. This is despite the 𝐿150 MHz−SFR
conversionalsobeingderivedfromtheLOFARDeepFieldsdataand
SED fits. At first glance, it is worrying that we obtain such different

4.2 The impact of the calibration between radio luminosity and
SFR
As discussed inSection 4.1, the derived star formationrate function
dependsstronglyonthemethodusedtoestimatestarformationrates.
Above∼SFR★,theSFRfunctionishighlydependentonthemethod
used to infer SFRs. We expect that this is, at least in part, due to a
combination of Eddington bias (Eddington 1913) and the scatter in
theL150 MHz−SFRrelation. In this section, we explore the effects
of different amounts of scatter on the derived star formation rate
function. Using a simple simulation, we demonstrate the magnitude
of the bias and derive correction factors.
We begin by generating ∼300million mock sources with star
formation rates drawn from a Saunders et al. (1990) function with
defaultvaluesof SFR★=0and𝜙★=0.Weset𝜎=0.38(theaverage
valueof𝜎fromfitstotheconsensusestimate-derivedSFRfunction
at𝑧≲1). The modelled base SFR function is shown in black in the
left-hand panel of Figure 9. We then simulate the radio luminosities
of the mock sources using Equation 6, adding scatter drawn from a
Gaussiandistributionwith Σ=[0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5]dex,buttruncated
at0.7 dex.Thisenablesustomimicthestar-forminggalaxyselection

above∼SFR★: larger scatter in the relation causes the observed
number density of galaxies to increase at the bright end, causing a
gentler fall-off of the exponential (e.g. see the exaggerated scatter
values of 0.5shown by the green lines). Because of the steepness
of the original modelled SFR function, the number of sources ‘scat-
tered up’ to those SFRs (coloured lines) can vastly exceed (by up to

offsets, in combination with the differences between our multiple
estimates of the SFR function, to constrain the true scatter on the
𝐿150 MHz−SFRrelation. We use the SFR functions derived from
the consensus estimates as the ‘truth’ (analogous to the black SFR
functionintheleft-handpanelofFigure9);ofcourse,SFRsderived
from SED fitting have their own uncertainties, but these are not de-
pendent on the scatter in the 𝐿150 MHz−SFRrelation. We compare
themtotheSFRsderivedfromtheradioluminosityfunctions,using

0.31±0.01 dexat1<log10(SFR/M⊙yr−1)<2.
As shown, the measured radio luminosity function (and the SFR
function derived by scaling this with a single 𝐿150 MHz−SFRcal-
ibration) will have an artificially shallower bright end slope due to
the∼0.3 dexscatter in the 𝐿150 MHz−SFRrelation. This will lead
to an overestimation of the cosmic star formation rate density. By
integrating the modelled SFR function derived using different val-
ues of scatter, and comparing to the integrated base SFR function,
we estimate the degree of boosting of the SFRD. We hence derive
correction factors that can be applied to values of SFRD derived
using a single 𝐿150 MHz−SFRcalibration. We derive the multi-
plicativecorrectionfactor CORR SFRD=[1.0,0.96,0.93]forscatter
Σ =[0.2,0.3,0.4]dex. Without the exclusion of sources classified
as radio-loud AGN, this correction would need to be larger. In Sec-

5 THE COSMIC STAR FORMATION DENSITY HISTORY
The cosmic star formation rate density can be calculated at a given
epoch, z, by integrating the radio luminosity function as follows:
SFRD(𝑧)=CORR SFRD×∫𝐿max
𝐿min𝜙(𝐿,𝑧)SFR(𝐿)d log10𝐿(8)
At each redshift, we derive estimates of the SFRDfor each of the
three fields and for all fields combined, by integrating the param-
eterised radio luminosity function presented in Equation 5 with
the appropriate best-fitting parameters. We adopt a lower lumi-
nosity limit 𝐿min=0.03𝐿★, and an upper luminosity limit of
𝐿max=1028W Hz−1(an order of magnitude brighter than our
brightest luminosity bin). In Appendix E we present tests showing
that the derived SFRD is robust to our choice of integration limits.

5.2 Comparison to literature data
In this section, we compare our SFRD measurements to estimates
from individual studies of star-forming galaxies selected using a va-
rietyofmethods.Whilethereexistavastnumberoflow-zmeasure-
ments in the literature, we focus on those that reach out to high red-
shift,includingseveralthathavebeenpublishedsincethecompilation
ofMadau&Dickinson(2014),andthosethatuselonger-wavelength
SFR estimators. As shown in Figure 11, previous estimates show a
consistent general form, with the SFRD increasing between 𝑧=0
and𝑧∼2andthendecliningtowardshigherredshift.However,exact
measurements disagree by >0.4 dexat any given redshift. Here, we
compare our LOFAR results to several previous measurements in
detail.

Chabrier (2003) IMF, and plot both corrected and uncorrected es-
timates in grey. Our dust-independent estimate lies in between the
dust-uncorrectedanddust-correctedvalues,whichmayindicatethat
the necessary correction for dust attenuation was overestimated.
Driver et al. (2018) combined 𝑟-band selected galaxies from
GAMA(Driveretal.2011;Liskeetal.2015), 𝑖-bandselectedgalax-
ies from G10-COSMOS (Davies et al. 2015; Andrews et al. 2017)
and1.6𝜇m-selectedgalaxiesfrom3D- HST(Momchevaetal.2016)
in their analysis. They derived SFRs using MAGPHYS , with various
combinationsofmulti-wavelengthdata.TheirSFRDestimates(blue
squares) fall below ours at all redshifts apart from 𝑧∼3.5. Inter-
estingly, there is a particular increase in the offset between 𝑧=1.6
(offset 0.18 dex) and𝑧=1.975(offset 0.31 dex). Between these two
redshifts,thesamplechangesfromincludingG10-COSMOSsources
to a 3D-HST-only sample for which SFRs are derived without FIR
data. The large offsets between our dust-independent estimate and
theirs at𝑧∼2and𝑧∼2.4suggests that dust-obscured star forma-
tion is significant at these redshifts and that, in the absence of FIR
data,theyareunder-predictingtheSFRD.Ourestimatesareinnear-
perfect agreement at 𝑧∼3.5−4. This implies that the contribution
of dust-obscured star formation to the total SFRD is lower by then;
this is broadly in agreement with Dunlop et al. (2017) and Zavala
et al. (2021).
SFRD estimates using FIR-based studies are generally in better
agreement with ours. We overplot estimates from Herschel-selected
samples (Gruppioni et al. 2013; green hexagons). These agree with
ourbest-fittinglinetowithin ∼0.15 dexat𝑧<3.5.At𝑧∼3.6,their
error bars are very large but remain consistent with our estimate.
We also compare to measurements from Dunlop et al. (2017) (or-
ange stars), who combined direct detections and stacking of ALMA
imaginginthe HubbleUltraDeepField withHST-derivedSFRmea-
surements from the rest-frame UV to estimate the total SFRD. Our
measurements are consistent with theirs.
Finally,wecomparetootherworkbasedonradiocontinuumemis-
sion.Karimetal.(2011)stacked 1.4 GHzdatafromVLA-COSMOS,

field and refining the source selection to a fully mass-selected sam-ple (using𝐾𝑆-band data for galaxies at 𝑧 <2.5and3.6𝜇mdata at
higher redshifts). Our measurements are fully consistent with those
of Leslie et al. (2020), but are discrepant with those of Karim et al.
(2011) at𝑧≲1.5. Leslie et al. (2020) note that Karim et al. (2011)
useadifferent 𝐿radio−SFRcalibration,whichyieldslowerSFRs,but
differencesarealsolikelydrivenbythedeeperparentcatalogueused
by Leslie et al. (2020).
Enia et al. (2022) constructed a 1.4 GHz-selected sample using
VLA observations in GOODS-N to measure the SFRD to 𝑧∼3.5.
These measurements are also fully consistent with ours and with
those of Leslie et al. (2020). We note, though, that our considerably
larger area (∼26 deg2compared to∼2 deg2for VLA-COSMOS
and171 arcmin2for GOODS-N) enables much tighter constraints.
The measurements of Novak et al. (2017) are below ours (by up to
0.4 dex) and also below those of Enia et al. (2022) and Leslie et al.
(2020). This is perhaps surprising, given that like Enia et al. (2022)
and this work, Novak et al. (2017) use a radio-selected sample and
theluminosityfunctionstheyderiveareingoodagreementwithours
(once scaled to the same rest-frame wavelength; see Figure 5). Enia
et al. (2022) suggest that discrepancies between their measurements
and those of Novak et al. (2017) might be due to the shallower faint
end slope used by Novak et al. (2017), but our fitted faint end slope
isactuallyslightlyshallowerthanthatderivedbyNovaketal.(2017)
(note that Novak et al. 2017 derive their slope from other samples
of radio data rather than their own VLA-COSMOS data; at the faint
end,dataintheirfitisdrawnfromCondonetal.2002).Asnotedby
Leslieetal.(2020)andhighlightedinFigure8,theimpactofdifferent
𝐿radio−SFRcalibrationsissignificant.Thiscanbeseenmostclearly
in the differences between our SFRD predictions and those derived
by Novak et al. (2017). Given the consistency with our luminosity
function measurements out to 𝑧∼3, this discrepancy appears to
stemfromtheirdifferent,redshift-dependent, 𝑞IR-based𝐿radio−SFR
conversion.
Our results highlight significant differences between SFRD mea-
surements derived from UV/optical/IR data and those derived from
FIR/radio data. As described above, these differences likely stem
from a number of sources. Incomplete samples and uncertainties in
dust corrections affect samples selected at shorter wavelengths, and
may drive some of the differences between the SFRD estimated by
Driver et al. (2018) and other estimates. Differences in the adopted
SFR calibrations and values assumed for the faint-end slope of lu-
minosity functions affect all estimates, and are most clearly seen
from the different SFRD measurements derived using similar data
(e.g. discrepancies between the 1.4 GHz-derived SFRD measure-
ments constructed by Karim et al. 2011 Novak et al. 2017, Leslie
et al. 2020, and Enia et al. 2022). In this work, we fix the faint-
end slope of the radio luminosity function to the value derived at
𝑧=0.03−0.30.Itstruevalueisunconstrainedbyourdataathigher

Simbapredicts a lower SFRD than measured from LOFAR, with
the most substantial discrepancies (of more than a factor of 2) seen

Simbagalaxies displaying a lower normalisation than is observed at
this epoch.
5.4 Further work
In this work, we have provided important constraints on the cosmic
history of star formation based on a statistical study of the deep-
est available low-frequency radio source counts. However, there are
some areas in which our method might be improved in future work.
Wehaveadoptedasimplifiedmodeloftheseparationofradiosources
into those produced by AGN and those produced by stars; in reality,
therewillbesourceswherebothmechanismscontributetotheradio
emission. There will be a jet contribution to the radio emission in
some of the radio-quiet AGN included in the sample in this paper,
andastarformationcontributiontotheradioemissioninsomeofthe
radio-loud AGN excluded from this work. It has long been known
that synchrotron radio jets ejected by the AGN can induce star for-
mationastheypropagateoutwardsfromtheirhostgalaxynucleiinto
the galactic and intergalactic medium (e.g. Rees 1989; Gaibler et al.
2012). A prominent low-redshift example is 3C277.3/Coma A (Mi-
ley et al. 1981; Capetti et al. 2022). There are also indications that
this mechanism could be important at high redshift; in both the spi-
derweb proto-cluster at 𝑧=2.2and 4C41.17 at 𝑧=3.8, alignments
seen between the radio, optical, CO and X-ray emission have been
interpretedasstarformationbeinginducedbytheradiojets(Bicknell
et al. 2000; Miley & De Breuck 2008; see also Duncan et al. 2023).
LOFAR’suniquecombinationofsensitivityandhighresolutionat
lowfrequenciesequipsitwelltodetectandmapradio-loudgalaxies
outtothehighestredshifts.Imagingwiththeinternationalbaselines
will help to distinguish radio jets from star formation morpholog-
ically (e.g. Morabito et al. 2022a). In addition, the new William
HerschelTelescopeEnhancedAreaVelocityExplorer(WEAVE;Jin
et al. 2022), a multi-object fiber-fed spectrograph that has just seen
first light, will target all radio-detected sources within the LOFAR
Deep Fields (WEAVE-LOFAR; Smith et al. 2016). This will pro-
vide a vastly larger number of spectroscopic redshifts for the radio
sources, additionally enabling better source classifications.
6 CONCLUSIONS

LOFAR Deep Fields to study the cosmic star formation history in a

ples of galaxies with radio emission dominated by star formation,
from𝑧∼0to𝑧∼4. Our main conclusions are summarised here:
•Out to𝑧∼3, our 150 MHz luminosity functions are in good
agreement with the scaled 1.4 GHzluminosity functions derived
by Novak et al. (2017) using VLA-COSMOS data (assuming a
spectral index 𝛼=−0.7). Given the larger area spanned by the

order of magnitude brighter luminosities, while reaching similar
luminosities at the faint end.
•Our derived 0< 𝑧 < 0.3 150 MHz luminosity function is well-
fitted by a parametrisation of the form:
𝜙(𝐿)=𝜙★

with log10(𝜙★/Mpc−3dex−1)=−2.46±0.01,𝜎=0.49±0.01,
𝛼=1.12±0.01andlog10(𝐿★/W Hz−1)=22.40+0.02
−0.03.
•Using the values of 𝜎and𝛼derived to our low redshift data, we
fit our higher redshift radio luminosity functions using the same
parametrisation, to constrain the evolution of 𝜙★and𝐿★.
•We show that transforming a radio luminosity function to a
star formation rate function is complicated by the scatter in the
𝐿radio−SFRrelation.Starformationratefunctionsderivedusing
this conversion tend to lie above those derived using SFRs ob-
tained from SED fitting at SFR≳SFR★, with deviations of up to
anorderofmagnitudeatthehighestSFRs.Usingasimplemodel,
we show that higher values of scatter in the 𝐿radio−SFRcause a
gentlerfall-offoftheexponentialofthemeasuredradioluminosity
function. This effect is most important where the luminosity (or
star-formation rate) function is steepest, above its break. This can
leadtoanoverestimationofthecosmicstarformationratedensity,
whichisgenerallyderivedbyintegratingthemeasuredluminosity
function.Themagnitudeofthecorrectiondependsonthetheform
oftheluminosityfunction,thescatterinthe 𝐿radio−SFRrelation,
and the details of the sample selection (i.e. whether sources that
are particularly radio-loud for their SFR are excluded from the
sample). By comparing the difference in the inferred SFRFs us-
ing the two methods to our model of the bias, we constrain the
scatter in the 𝐿radio−SFRrelation of star-forming galaxies to be
∼0.3 dex. Encouragingly, this value is in line with recent work
that constrains the scatter using an independent method (Smith
et al. 2021). We derive an appropriate correction factor to apply
to the SFRD of∼0.96±0.04.
•We constrain the cosmic star formation rate density from 𝑧∼0
to𝑧∼4, by integrating our 𝐿150 MHzluminosity functions, in
combination with a self-consistently derived 𝐿150 MHz−SFRre-
lation, correcting for its scatter. Since the SFRD is constructed
using radio-selected samples, our measurements are robust to the
effects of dust. Our derived SFRD lies between previous com-
pilations at all redshifts studied. Our measurements are in good
agreement with those previously derived using smaller 1.4 GHz-
selected samples (e.g. Leslie et al. 2020; Enia et al. 2022) and
from FIR-based studies (e.g. Gruppioni et al. 2013; Dunlop
et al. 2017). Our derived SFRD is well-fitted by a model of
the form SFRD(𝑧)=𝐶
10𝐴(𝑧−𝑧0)+10𝐵(𝑧−𝑧0), with𝐴=−0.89+0.08
−0.07,
𝐵=0.22±0.04,log10𝐶=−0.76±0.05and𝑧0=1.22±0.15.
Prospects for future census studies of radio-selected star-forming
galaxies are bright. The LOFAR Deep Fields survey continues to
observe all three fields. EN1 has already been observed for 500 hr,
with imaging reaching ∼12𝜇Jy/beam. By mid-2023 (following
LOFAR Cycles 18 and 19), we expect to reach 16𝜇Jy/beamin
Boötes with 312 hrof data, and 13𝜇Jy/beamin the Lockman Hole
with 352 hrof data. We are also observing in the NEP, where we
expect to reach 13𝜇Jy/beamin400 hr. These deeper LoTSS radio
data, alongside spectra from WEAVE-LOFAR, will build up large,
dust-independent samples of star-forming galaxies for further study,at fainter star formation rates than previously possible. This will
enable not only the characterisation of the global cosmic SFRD but
also the investigation of the drivers of star formation and quenching
in sub-populations over cosmic time.

the Boötes-derived SFRD for different choices of lower (left) and
upper (right) luminosity limits. We find that our derived SFRD is
robust to changes in the lower limit between 0.003𝐿★and0.1𝐿★
(we adopt 0.03𝐿★in this work) and to changes in the upper limit
between 1027.5W Hz−1and1028.5W Hz−1(weadopt 1028W Hz−1
in this work).

Figure D1: The cosmic star formation rate density, derived by integrating the radio luminosity function using the 𝐿150 MHz−SFRrelation
of Smith et al. (2021), is shown in blue, purple and red for Elais-N1, Boötes and the Lockman Hole, respectively. In orange, we show the
SFRD that would be derived without correcting for uncertainties in the photometric redshifts (see Figure 3 and Table B1) or scatter in the
𝐿150 MHz−SFRrelation (see Section 4.2). Corrections for photometric redshift uncertainties have minor effects on the majority of redshift
bins, but are important at 𝑧∼1−2for Elais-N1 and the Lockman Hole, which lack 𝐻−band data.

artificial x-axis offsets are added to display small differences most clearly. The impact of changing either the lower or the upper integration
