The Lindbladian formalism models open
quantum systems using a ‘bottom-up’ ap-
proach, deriving linear dynamics from
system-environment interactions. We
present a ‘top-down’ approach starting
with phenomenological constraints, focus-
ing on system’s structure, subsystems’ in-
teractions, environmental effects, and of-
ten using a non-equilibrium variational
principle designed to enforce strict ther-
modynamic consistency. However, incor-
porating the second law’s requirement —
that Gibbs states are the sole stable equi-
libria — necessitates nonlinear dynamics,
challenging no-signaling principles in com-
posite systems. We reintroduce ‘local per-
ception operators’ and show that they al-
low to model signaling-free non-local ef-
fects. Using the steepest-entropy-ascent
variational principle as an example, we
demonstrate the validity of the ‘top-down’
approachforintegratingquantummechan-
ics and thermodynamics in phenomeno-
logical models, with potential applications
in quantum computing and resource theo-
ries.
1 Introduction
The study of open-quantum systems can be cate-
gorized into two general approaches. The prevail-
ing of the two is based on the celebrated Gorini-
Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) mas-
ter equation under the assumption that the sys-
tem is weakly coupled to the background environ-
ment (for recent reviews and generalizations, see,
Rohit Kishan Ray : rkray@ibs.re.kr
Gian Paolo Beretta : gianpaolo.beretta@unibs.ite.g., [1, 2]). Various thermodynamic concepts are
used to theorize in this paradigm [3], including
but not limited to finite-size heat baths [4] and
reinterpretations of the second law of thermody-
namics [5]. Here, we start from the Schrödinger
equation of the system-background composite in
a pure state and trace out the background (or
a part of it) to model irreversible dynamics for
the system under observation. As emphasized
by Kosloff [1], a suitable set of assumptions is
required, but the key idea is that initially, the
system and background start in an uncorrelated
product state. Then further assumptions are
added to arrive at a satisfactory model master
equationwhich is ‘essentiallycompatiblewiththe
lawsofthermodynamics.’ Wedubthistraditional
approach ‘bottom-up’. It starts from the funda-
mentaldogmathattheuniverseisaclosedsystem
evolving unitarily and the heuristic dogma that
any quantum system is influenced by its environ-
ment. Then, adding enough ‘reasonable’ (model-
ing) assumptions, we finally derive a thermody-
namicallyconsistenteffectivelyphenomenological
masterequationforthedensityoperatorofthelo-
cal system (or system plus the immediate portion
of the environment strongly coupled to it).
For four decades, an alternative phenomeno-
logical approach has existed but remains seldom
used. For contrast, we call this a ‘top-down’ ap-
proach. It assumes that a physical phenomenon
is described by local model dynamics for the den-
sity operator of the system, which may comprise
multiplesubsystemsandincludestronglycoupled
parts of the environment. We strive to find the
most general master equation that accounts for
the composite system’s features and subsystem
interactions while ensuring strong compatibility
with thermodynamics. Importantly, if we seek

Gibbsstatesbetheonlyconditionallystableequi-
librium states of the dynamics [6, 7] — a thermo-
dynamic compatibility requirement seldom con-
sideredandoftenoverlookedinthebottom-upap-
proach — then the condition that the final model
dynamics be linear in density operator must be
removed. In other words, the top-down approach

monsandPark[6]showthatforsuchanapproach
to incorporate a successful merger of thermody-
namics and mechanics, non-linearity in the dy-
namics is an essential requirement1.
Consider the recent experimental work by
Somhorst et al.[10], where the commonly ac-
cepted view of emergent thermodynamics from
the openness of a local system has been demon-
stratively validated. This evidence reinforces
the need for phenomenological top-down mod-
els equipped with strong thermodynamic consis-
tency. We claim this because, most of the time,
experimenters do not have such full control of the
environment of the local system of interest as in
the cited experiment, and most of the time, very
little is known about the details of the actual
environment and its coupling with the system.
Yet, to model the local thermodynamic evolution
employing linear Kraus maps, it is necessary to
concoct the proper Lindblad operators, which in
turn require a model of the immediate environ-
ment. Instead, top-down models can incorporate
the known physics of the system and model phe-
nomenologicallythe‘apparentdecoherencedueto
distribution of information among the environ-
mental degrees of freedom.’ They can do so by a
minimal set of empirical parameters, and can ac-
commodate situations where more physical (pos-
sibly non-commuting [11]) observables are con-
servedatthelocallevelthanjustthemeanenergy
(like in some experiments in [10]).
A powerful family of top-down master equa-
tions originates from a nonlinear extension of
1In a related context, we note that recent experiments
testing the nonlinear quantum mechanics (NQM) [8, 9]
have placed constraints on potential deviations from stan-
dard quantum mechanics, but the results remain typically
at a90%confidence level. While we do not explore NQM
in this work, it is important to clarify that our formalism
is not part of this class. Instead, it is a phenomenologi-
calapproachaimedatintegratingquantummechanicsand
thermodynamics to describe irreversible dynamics and en-
sure thermodynamic consistency at a fundamental level.quantum mechanics initiated by Hatsopoulos
and Gyftopoulos [12–15], and developed by
Beretta [16–25]. This formalism originally sought
to establish the second law of thermodynamics as
a foundational principle at par with other conser-
vation laws, embedded in a nonlinear law of evo-
lution for mixed density operators, thus concep-
tualizing stability of canonical Gibbs states and
spontaneous decoherence. Later, the steepest en-
tropy ascent (SEA) formalism was developed and
usedsuccessfullyasaphenomenologicalmodeling
tool, applied to various quantum systems [26–
28] including quantum computing [29, 30]. It
was even elevated to the conceptual status of
the fourth law of thermodynamics [31, 32] be-
cause of its equivalence with most of the more
recent far-non-equilibrium thermodynamic mod-
eling non-quantal formalisms.
Inthispaper,weaimtoexplicitlyshowthatde-
spite the embedded non-linearity in the equation
of motion of SEA model dynamics, the evolution
of a composite system is free from exotic interac-
tions responsible for signaling between the non-
interacting subsystems. Although the authors in
Refs. [22, 24, 25, 27] claim that the SEA formal-
ism abides by the no-signaling criteria (more on
this later), it demands a discussion on its own as
the claim is not a trivial one.
To attract future discussion on this topic,
that may bear relevance also for current non-
equilibriummodelingeffortsinthequantumcom-
puting framework, we have structured the paper
in the following form. In the next Section 2, we
delve deeper into the meaning of signaling as es-
tablished in the literature [33–40] and how it re-
lates to nonlinearity. Thereafter, in Section 3, we
explore the philosophical background that gave
birth to the original SEA nonlinear law of evo-
lution. In Section 4, we show how a nonlinear
dynamics would help alleviate a still unresolved
conundrumabouttheconceptofindividualquan-
tum state. In Section 5, we discuss the measure-
theoretic representation of mixed ensembles that
allows to treat unambiguously nonlinearities and
mixing of ensembles. We follow this by reintro-
ducing and discussing in Section 6 the concept of
local perception operators (LPO), and showing
in Section 7 their crucial role in the construc-
tion of nonlinear and non-local model dynam-
ics not affected by signaling issues. In Section 8
we discuss the system’s structure dependence of
2the composite-system version of the SEA equa-
tion of motion and we argue that, by construc-
tion, its nonlinearities and non-localities do not
cause signaling issues. In Section 9 we show how
the general SEA equation of motion can be de-
rived from a special implementation of the maxi-
mum entropy production variational principle. In
Section 10 we derive the simplest version of the
composite-system SEA equation of motion. In
Section 11, we finally consider some explicit ex-
amples to validate our argument and illustrate
pictorially some features of SEA evolution. In
Section 12, we summarize our conclusions.
2 No-signaling and nonlinearity
Quantum mechanics (QM), as described by the
Schrödinger-von Neumann formalism, is tradi-
tionally characterized by its linearity in state
space and time evolution. Mean values of global
and local properties and their time evolutions
under unitary (and completely positive) dynam-
ics, are linear functionals of the density operator.
This linearity implies no-cloning, first shown by
Park [41] and later rediscovered by Ghirardi [42],
Wootters and Zurek [43], and Dieks [44]. Linear-
ity also implies no-signaling [45–48]. However,
Weinberg questioned this linear characteristic of
QM [49]. He introduced nonlinearity in the oper-
ator formalism of the Schrödinger equation while
preserving order-one homogeneity. This was one
of the earliest examples of what is now broadly
referred to as nonlinear quantum mechanics
(NQM). Gisin [33] showed that such formalism
could facilitate faster-than-light communication,
viz.,signaling. Polchinski [34] proposed an
alternative method to prevent signaling by
restricting local evolutions to depend solely on
the corresponding reduced density operators.
However, this formalism still allowed signaling
between different branches of the wavefunction
(Everett telephone) [34]. Wódkiewicz and Scully
[35] analyzed the nonlinear evolution of two-level
atoms, with solutions later shown to depend on
interpretation [36]. Czachor also showed that a
nonlinear operator induces mobility phenomena
(non-conservation of the inner-product of two
pure states)[50].
Nonlinearity introduced via stochastic QM
through Lindblad operator formalism [51] foropen quantum systems has been shown to respect
no-signaling. Weinberg-inspired nonlinearities,
interestingly, enable faster algorithms to solve
NP-complete problems in polynomial time [37].
Later work [38] demonstrated that nonlinearity
in QM can be incorporated without violating no-
signaling, as long as time evolution is nonlinear
while state space and operators remain linear.
More recently, convex quasilinear maps [39, 52]
were shown to support nonlinear QM dynamics
without signaling, preserving key features of
QM. Rembieliński and Caban [39] identified this
as the minimal allowable deviation from QM’s
linear structure. In a recent work, Kaplan and
Rajendran [53] showed that in a low-temperature
limit, the non-linearity introduced in quantum
field theory results in causal nonlinear quantum
mechanics, which is also another version of NQM.
Therefore, introducing nonlinearity in quan-
tum mechanics (QM) can lead to exotic
interactions that are difficult to justify phys-
ically. Nonlinear theories, as inspired by the
Weinberg approach, allow for entropy oscilla-
tion [50]. Stochastic, jump-induced mixing of
pure states [51] offers a basis for developing a
thermodynamically consistent nonlinear master
equation for the density operator of an open
system. However, the search for theoretically
consistent nonlinear models of quantum ther-
modynamics remains an open challenge. This
is where we claim — and later demonstrate in
the following sections — that the ’top-down’
approach of SEA resolves the signaling problem
entirely (pictorially sketched in Figure 1). From
a philosophical perspective, SEA also addresses
other conceptual conundrums, in particular the
Schrödinger-Park paradox [54, 55], as already
discussed by Park [56] and Beretta [57].
The no-signaling condition, as noted in [38], is
typically enforced by requiring that, in the ab-
sence of mutual interactions between subsystems
A and B, the evolution of A’s local observables
depends solely on its reduced state. Formally, we
express this as:
dρJ
dt=f(ρJ), (1)
whereρJis the reduced density operator (local
state) of subsystem J. The SEA formalism, how-
ever, adopts a less restrictive perspective [22]. It

Section 8 for details),

SEA
Philosophically, SEA evolution was designed
to conceive the irreversible equilibration and
decoherence as a fundamental spontaneous dy-
namical feature, contrary to the coarse-graining
approach. Entropy, the second law, and ir-
reversibility could attain a more fundamental
status as deterministic outcomes of quantal
evolution [58], without contradicting standard
QM. From the outset [16, 17, 59], nonlinearity
was recognized as essential [6, 60] for this
purpose. While the prevalent notion was — and
still is — that the second law is emerging and
statistical, the pioneers of SEA believed that the
many ‘knots of thermodynamics’ [60, 61] could,
at least conceptually, be untied by elevating it
to a more fundamental stature. This motivated
Hatsopoulos and Gyftopoulos (HG) to develop a
unified theory of mechanics and thermodynam-
ics [12–15]. They laid the foundation for what is
now known as resource theory in quantum ther-
modynamics by extending ontological quantum
states to include both pure and mixed density
operators. The HG unified (resource) theory
explicitly defines and fully characterizes the
concept — later rediscovered as ‘ergotropy’ [62]
— of maximum work extractable in a uni-
tary process with cyclic parameter changes
(theorems 3.2 and 3.3 in [13], which pioneered
also the use of ‘majorization’ in quantum theory).
Beretta’sdoctoralthesis[63]aimedtocomplete
the HG theory with two key goals: 1) to design
an equation of motion that establishes the sec-
ond law as a theorem, ensuring Gibbs states are
the only stable equilibrium states; and 2) to de-
velop an unambiguous statistical representation
of heterogeneous ensembles formed by statistical
mixing of homogeneous (pure) ensembles2as one-
to-one with the full set of pure and mixed density
2In the context of quantum thermodynamics, an ‘un-
ambiguous statistical representation of heterogeneous en-
sembles’ensuresacleardistinctionbetweenintrinsicquan-
tum uncertainties and classical statistical mixing. This
approach, as developed by Beretta [63], treats heteroge-
neous ensembles as distributions over the full set of pure
and mixed density operators, avoiding ambiguities asso-
ciated with von Neumann’s statistical interpretation and
resolving the Schrödinger-Park paradox. More on this in
Section 5.
4operators. The outcome of the first objective was
the SEA formalism, including the introduction of
local perception operators. The second objective
led to the representation of generic ensembles us-
ing measure-theoretic distributions (see Section
5 for details) over the set of ontological states.
The SEA formalism proved to be both robust
and versatile, making it a powerful tool for ther-
modynamically consistent non-equilibrium mod-
eling. Its applications expanded beyond its origi-
nal scope to include phenomenological models in
areas such as decoherence [64], mesoscopic trans-
port rheology [65, 66], phase transitions [67], and
quantum computing [28–30, 68].
4 Nonlinear dynamics and the ontic
state conundrum
From a foundational perspective, the HG ap-
proach of assigning ontological status to the full
set of density operators, pure and mixed, offers
a potential resolution to the Schrödinger-Park
paradox on the ambiguity of individual quantum
states[54, 55, 57]. As noted by Park [56], treating
density operators as one-to-one with homoge-
neous ensembles resolves ambiguity under two
conditions: 1) that they evolve unitarily for short
times, with nonlinear dynamics dominating over
longer periods; and 2) that a full tomography,
even for heterogeneous preparations, must in-
clude both linear and nonlinear observables, such
as entropy, adiabatic availability, ergotropy, and
free energy.
The von Neumann prescription [69, Chapter
III] assigns a density operator to a statistical
mixture of pure states, with mixing coefficients
reflecting ignorance. However, Schrödinger [54]
questioned this from the outset due to the
non-unique decomposition of a mixed density
operator into weighted sums of pure states.
von Neumann’s approach irrecoverably blends
quantal probabilities with non-quantal statistical
weights, creating the ambiguity highlighted by
Schrödinger and Park. To understand how a law
of nonlinear evolution may resolve this issue,
letˆΠ0
1and ˆΠ0
2be two distinct homogeneous
preparations. At time t= 0, they generate
two initial ensembles of identically prepared,
strictly isolated, and non-interacting systems.
The ‘hat’ on Πdenotes homogeneity of thepreparation, and superscript ‘0’ refers to time
t= 0. According to the traditional statistical
formulation by von Neumann, a preparation
ˆΠishomogeneous if and only if it cannot be
replicated by any statistical composition of two
different preparations. The statistics of measure-
ment outcomes from a homogeneous preparation
are represented by a pure (idempotent) density
operator, ˆρ, satisfying ˆρ= ˆρ2. Consider a third
(heterogeneous) preparation Π0
3obtained by
the statistical mixture of ˆΠ0
1and ˆΠ0
2with fixed
weight 0< w < 1, so that, formally, we may
write Π0
3=wˆΠ0
1+ (1−w)ˆΠ0
2. To obtain a
quantum statistical mechanics (QSM) consistent
with Gibbs-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Bose-
Einstein equilibrium distributions, von Neumann
postulated that a heterogeneous preparation,
such as Π0
3, should be represented by a mixed
density operator ρ0
3=wˆρ0
1+ (1−w) ˆρ0
2. This
formulation, partly due to the linearity of quan-
tum mechanics, has served as the foundation for
successful frameworks such as equilibrium QSM
and the Lindbladian theory of open systems.
These successes often lead us to overlook the
Schrödinger-Park paradox or accept it as a seem-
ingly enigmatic aspect of quantum theory. It
arises when interpreting a heterogeneous ensem-
ble. If we assume each member of the ensem-
ble is prepared in either state ˆρ0
1(with proba-
bilityw) or ˆρ0
2(with probability 1−w), exclud-
ing all other states, we face a contradiction. The
same mixed density operator ρ0
3allows infinitely
many alternative decompositions. For instance,
the decomposition, ρ0
3=w′ˆρ0
4+ (1−w′) ˆρ0
5sug-
gests that the ensemble consists only of ˆρ0
4and
ˆρ0
5, excluding ˆρ0
1andˆρ0
2. This inconsistency chal-
lenges the notion of individual states in a hetero-
geneous ensemble and complicates the interpre-
tation of QSM. Under a linear evolution map for
the homogeneous preparations, ˆΠt=Lt(ˆΠ0), and
mixing of homogeneous preparations with time-
invariant weights, we have
Πt
3=wˆΠt
1+(1−w)ˆΠt
2=wLt(ˆΠ0
1)+(1−w)Lt(Π0
2)
and, by the linearity of Lt,Πt
3=Lt(ˆΠ0
3). Thus,
the von Neumann recipe gives ρt
3=wˆρt
1+
(1−w) ˆρt
2and, for linear observables, it yields the
correct statistics of measurements,

=wTr/parenleftig
Aˆρt
1/parenrightig
+ (1−w) Tr/parenleftig
Aˆρt
2/parenrightig
.
5It also entails that for an Nlevel system, a
full tomography of a heterogeneous preparation
requires the measurement of a quorum of only
N2−1independent linear observables.
Instead, if the evolution map for homogeneous
preparations is nonlinear, ˆΠt=Nt(ˆΠ0), and the
statistical mixing weights remain time-invariant,
we obtain
Πt
3=wˆΠt
1+(1−w)ˆΠt
2=wNt(ˆΠ0
1)+(1−w)Nt(Π0
2)
and, ingeneral, duetothenonlinearityof Nt, this
does not satisfy Πt
3̸=Nt(ˆΠ0
3). This contradicts
the von Neumann prescription, which would
assign the density operator ρt
3=wρt
1+ (1−w)ρt
2
to preparation Πt
3andρ0
3=wρ0
1+ (1−w)ρ0
2to
preparation Π0
3. As noted by Rembieliński and
Caban [39], a sufficient condition for a nonlinear
map to be no-signaling is convex-quasilinearity.
That is, it must always admit a w′, with
0≤w′≤1, such that ρt
3=w′ρt
1+ (1−w′)ρt
2.
Ferreroet al.[38] made a similar observation but
left its interpretation as an open problem.
The HG ontological hypothesis alleviates this
interpretation issue. Regardless of how a density
operator is decomposed, wand1−wno longer
represent epistemic ignorance. This is because
both pure and mixed density operators have on-
tic status, meaning they represent homogeneous
preparations.
5 Measure-theoretic representation of
statistics from mixed ensembles
To resolve the Schrödinger-Park paradox about
individual states in QSM without contradicting
the successes of QM, Beretta [63] proposed re-
placing the von Neumann prescription for mea-
surementstatisticsfrommixedensembleswithan
unambiguous representation akin to classical sta-
tistical mechanics. The recipe assigns to every
preparation Π(whether homogeneous or hetero-
geneous) a normalized measureµΠdefined on the
(ontic) quantal state domain P, which consists
of the mathematical objects representing homo-
geneous preparations (homogeneous ensembles).
The normalization condition is
µΠ(P) =/integraldisplay
PµΠ(dρ) = 1. (3)In usual von Neumann QSM, the quantal state
domainPQSMis the set of all one-dimensional
projection operators ( i.e., the idempotent density
operators)definedontheHilbertspaceofthesys-
tem. Instead, the HG unified theory assumes the
broader quantal state domain PHGconsisting of
the set of all possible density operators ρ, idem-
potent and not.
Among the measures defined on P, theDirac
measures , defined as follows, play a crucial role.
LetEdenote any subset of P, then
δρ(E) =/braceleftigg
1,ifρ∈E
0,ifρ /∈E(4)
The support of a Dirac measure δ˜ρ,i.e., the sub-
set ofPfor which it is nonzero, is a single-point
coinciding with the state operator ˜ρ.
The statistical mixing of preparations, Π3=
wΠ1+ (1−w) Π2, is represented by the weighted
sum of the corresponding measures,
µΠ3=wµΠ1+ (1−w)µΠ2. (5)
This representation removes ambiguities because:
1. No Dirac measure can be decomposed into
a weighted sum of different Dirac measures,
satisfying von Neumann’s definition of ho-
mogeneous preparations.
2. Any measure has a unique decomposition
into a weighted sum (or integral) of Dirac
measures — removing the Schrödinger-Park
paradox. This ensures that each member of
a heterogeneous ensemble is in some well de-
fined (albeit unknown) individual state.
The expected mean value of any physical ob-
servable represented by the (linear or nonlinear)
functionalgdefinedonP, isgivenforpreparation

For example, for P=PHGandg(ρ) =
−kBTr(ρlnρ), this gives the ‘proper’ expected
value of measurements of the von Neumann en-
tropy,i.e., the weighted sum of the entropies of
the component homogeneous sub-ensembles.
It is noteworthy that for observables repre-
sented by linear functionals on P, such asg(ρ) =
Tr(Gρ), we have
⟨g⟩Π3=wTr/parenleftig
GρˆΠ1/parenrightig
+ (1−w) Tr/parenleftig
GρˆΠ2/parenrightig
= Tr/parenleftig
G[wρˆΠ1+ (1−w)ρˆΠ2]/parenrightig
= Tr(GW Π3) =g(WΠ3), (8)
whereWΠ3is the usual von Neumann statisti-
cal operator, defined by the weighted sum of the
densityoperatorsrepresentingthecomponentho-
mogeneous sub-ensembles,
WΠ3=wρˆΠ1+ (1−w)ρˆΠ2. (9)
WΠ3is clearly an element of the convex comple-
tion,C(P), of the quantal state domain P. No-
tice that in general C(PQSM) =C(PHG) =PHG,
and for a qubitPQSMandPHGmap to the Bloch
sphere and the Block ball, respectively. Evalua-
tion of the linear functional g(·) = Tr(G·)atWΠ3
provides the correct expected mean value of mea-
surements of the corresponding observable on the
heterogeneous ensemble.
ButWΠ3does not fully describe the heteroge-
neous preparation Π3, because different prepara-
tions can yield the same linear tomography. In
other words, the linear tomography — obtained
by measuring the expected mean values ⟨qj⟩of a
quorum ofN2−1independent linear observables
Qjand solving⟨qj⟩= Tr(QjW)forW— is in-
sufficienttocharacterizeapreparation. Adecom-
positionofWintodifferentweightedsumsofden-
sity operators has no meaning in this theory, but
to emphasize that different heterogeneous prepa-
rations may result in the same linear tomogra-
phy. Even within orthodox QSM ( P=PQSM),
resolving the intrinsic quantum probabilities of
homogeneous preparations from the extrinsic un-
certainties of mixing requires additional indepen-
dent information beyond linear tomography.The measure-theoretic description of prepara-
tions enables a statistical quantum theory where
both linear and nonlinear functionals of the den-
sityoperatorcorrespondtoindependentlyanddi-
rectly measurable properties of a quantum sys-
tem, such as entropy, ergotropy, and adiabatic
availability. A nonlinear evolution equation for
the density operators in P,i.e., for the ho-
mogeneous preparations, may provide additional
nonlinear observables by measuring linear and
nonlinear observables at different times. As al-
readyrealizedbyPark[56], nonlinearityholdsthe
promise to preserve and reintegrate the notion of
individual state into quantum theory.

ℏ[HJ,ρJ]−i
ℏTrJ([V,ρ]). (10)
Thus, we recover the universal law ˙ρJ=
−i[HJ,ρJ]/ℏfor the local density operator ρJ=
TrJ(ρ)if the subsystem Jdoes not interact with
the others ( i.e., ifV=IJ⊗VJ).
Instead, a fully nonlinear evolution equation
for the density operator cannot have a univer-
sal structure because the subdivision into subsys-
tems must be explicitly embedded into the struc-
ture of the dynamical law (see [25] for more on
this). A different subdivision requires a different
equation of motion. The complex structure of the
SEA evolution law reflects the cost of abandoning
linearity but ensures compatibility with the cru-
cial constraint that correlations should not build
7up, and signaling should not occur between sub-
systems, other than via the interaction Hamilto-
nianVthrough the standard Schrödinger term
−i[H,ρ]/ℏin the evolution law.
Seldom used in composite quantum dynamics
but crucial, in our opinion, are the physical ob-
servables first introduced in [17] and later (start-
ing with [19]) referred to as ‘local perceptions of
global observables’. These are represented by the
‘local perception operators’ (LPO) on HJ, de-
fined along with their ‘deviation from the local
mean value’ operators and covariance functionals
as follows:
(X)J
ρ= TrJ[(IJ⊗ρJ)X], (11)
∆(X)J
ρ= (X)J

ρJ/braceleftig
∆(X)J
ρ,∆(Y)J
ρ/bracerightig/bracketrightig
,(13)
whereρJ= TrJ(ρ). For a bipartite system AB,
the LPOs (X)A
ρ(onHA) and (X)B
ρ(onHB) are
the unique operators that for a given XonHAB
and for all states ρ, satisfy the identity
Tr/bracketleftig
ρA(X)A
ρ/bracketrightig
= Tr[(ρA⊗ρB)X] = Tr/bracketleftig
ρB(X)B
ρ/bracketrightig
.
(14)
This confirms that they encapsulate all the infor-
mation that AandBcan infer about the global
observable X by classically sharing their local
states.
Operator (X)A
ρcan be viewed as the projection
ontoHAof the operator Xweighted by the local
stateρBof subsystem B. However, it is a local
observable for subsystem A which depends on the
overall state ρand overall observable X. Its lo-
calmeanvalue Tr/bracketleftig
ρA(X)A
ρ/bracketrightig
differsfromthemean
value Tr(ρX)for the overall system AB, except
whenAandBare uncorrelated ( ρ=ρA⊗ρB). It
was dubbed ‘local perception’ because even if B
performs a local tomography and sends the mea-
suredρBtoAby classical communication, the
most thatAcan measure locally about the over-
all observable Xis(X)A
ρ.
The overall energy and entropy of the compos-
ite system are locally perceived within subsystem
Jthrough the operators (H)J
ρand(S)J
ρdefined
onHJby Eq. (11), respectively with X=H, the
overall Hamiltonian, and X=S(ρ), the overall
(non-negative) entropy operator defined by
S(ρ) =−kBBln(ρ), (15)where we define the discontinuous log function
Bln(x) =/braceleftigg
ln(x),for0<x≤1,
0,otherwise.(16)
Note that the ‘locally perceived overall entropy’
operator
(S)J
ρ=−kBTrJ[(IJ⊗ρJ)Bln(ρ)], (17)
is different from the ‘local entropy’ operator
S(ρJ) =−kBBln(ρJ). (18)
Its local mean value Tr/bracketleftig
ρJ(S)J
ρ/bracketrightig

Only when ρ=ρJ⊗ρJthey are related by

ρ/bracketrightig
= Tr/bracketleftbigρJS(ρJ)/bracketrightbig+ Tr/bracketleftbigρJS(ρJ)/bracketrightbig
=−kBTr[ρln(ρ)].(19)
Likewise, the ‘locally perceived overall Hamil-
tonian’ operator (H)J
ρdiffers from the ‘local
Hamiltonian’ operator HJ. Its local mean value
Tr/bracketleftig
ρJ(H)J
ρ/bracketrightig

the local mean energy Tr/parenleftbigρJHJ/parenrightbig, and only when

ρJ(H)J
ρ/bracketrightig
= Tr/parenleftbigρJHJ/parenrightbig+ Tr/parenleftbigρJHJ/parenrightbig= Tr(ρH).
(20)
However, it is noteworthy that when the overall
observable Xis ‘separable for subsystem J,’ in
the sense that X=XJ⊗IJ+IJ⊗XJthen, even
ifρ̸=ρJ⊗ρJ, the deviations and covariances re-
duce to their local versions,

In general, the mean interaction energy,

Tr/parenleftbigρJµJJ/parenrightbig, between subsystem Jand the rest of
the system, J, are given by the respective mean

7 No-signaling and LPOs
To formalize the no-signaling definition follow-
ing [22] as discussed above, we adopt the view
thatlocaloperationscanbeactedonasubsystem
Jonly by means of a controlled time dependence
of its local Hamiltonian operator HJor its inter-
action operator VJBwith some other subsystem
B(possibly a properly modeled environment or
heat bath). Hence, we adopt the following
Definition (No-signaling) .IfJandJare non-
interacting, no local aspect of the time evolution
ofJcan be affected by local unitary operations
acted onJnor by other aspects of the local time
evolution of J.
Accordingly, consider a composite ABin state
ρ. A local unitary operation on Bchanges the
state to
ρ′= (IA⊗UB)ρ(IA⊗U†
B), (27)
whereUBis an arbitrary unitary operator
(U†
BUB=IB). Using the properties of the partial
trace, in particular,
TrB[(IA⊗XB)ZAB] = TrB[ZAB(IA⊗XB)],
(28)
TrA[(IA⊗XB)ZAB(IA⊗YB)] =XBTrA(ZAB)YB,
(29)
we obtain the identities
ρB= TrA[(IA⊗U†
B)ρ′(IA⊗UB)] =U†
Bρ′
BUB,
(30)
ρ′
A= TrB[(IA⊗UB)ρ(IA⊗U†
B)]
= TrB[(IA⊗U†
BUB)ρ]
= TrB[(IA⊗IB)ρ] =ρA, (31)
which confirms that a local operation on Bdoes
not affect the local state ρAofA. This result
supports the usual idea [38] that for no-signaling
it is sufficient that the dynamical model implies
evolutions of local observables that depend only
onρA. But it is seldom noted that this is not a
necessary condition.Next, we prove that not only the local reduced
stateρAbut also the LPO (F(ρ))A, of any well-
defined nonlinear function F(ρ)of the overall
state (such as the entropy function S(ρ)defined
earlier) remains unaffected by local unitary op-
erations on Bas per Eq. (27). Since the SEA
formalism is based on these local perception op-
erators, this result is an important lemma in the
proof that SEA is no-signaling.
So, letusapplyEq.(27)toagenericobservable
represented by a linear operator on Hthat we
denotebyF(ρ),whetheritisanontrivialfunction
ofρ, such asS(ρ), or not a function of ρ, such
asH. The corresponding LPO for subsystem A,
according to the defining Eq. (11), is given by
(F(ρ))A= TrB[(IA⊗ρB)F(ρ)]. (32)
A function of ρis defined from its eigen-
decomposition by
F(ρ) = ΛF(D)Λ†=/summationdisplay
jF(λj)|λj⟩⟨λj|,
whereρ= ΛDΛ†,D=/summationtext
jλj|j⟩⟨j|, and Λ =/summationtext
j|λj⟩⟨j|. Since unitary transformations do not
alter the eigenvalues,
F(ρ′) = Λ′F(D)Λ′†where Λ′= (IA⊗UB)Λ.
(33)
Therefore, using Eq. (30) in the last step, we ob-
tain
(F(ρ′))A= TrB[(IA⊗ρ′
B)F(ρ′)]
= TrB[(IA⊗ρ′
B) (IA⊗UB)ΛF(D)Λ†(IA⊗U†
B)]
= TrB[(IA⊗U†
Bρ′
BUB) ΛF(D)Λ†]
= TrB[(IA⊗ρB)F(ρ)] = (F(ρ))A. (34)
This confirms that local unitary operations on B
do not affect the LPOs of A. Hence, the proper
use of LPOs in a nonlinear evolution equation
does not cause signaling issues.
8 The local structure of dissipation in
composite-system SEA dynamics
Wearenowreadytointroducethefinalbutessen-
tialingredientofageneralcomposite-systemnon-
linear QM or master equation. This involves the
system’s structure-dependent expressions, which
determine how each subsystem contributes sep-
arately to the dissipative term in the equation
9of motion for the overall state ρ. As discussed
above — and recognized in early SEA litera-
ture [17, 22, 25] — the composite-system non-
linear evolution must explicitly reflect the inter-
nal structure of the system. This requires declar-
ing which subsystems are to be protected from
nonphysical effects such as signaling, exchange of
energy, or build-up of correlations between non-
interacting subsystems. Using the notation intro-
duced earlier, the structure proposed in [17, 25]
for the dissipative term, which supplements the
usual Hamiltonian term, is given by
dρ
dt=−i
ℏ[H,ρ]−M/summationdisplay
J=1{DJ
ρ,ρJ}⊗ρJ,(35)
where the ‘local dissipation operators’ DJ
ρ(on
HJ) may be nonlinear functions of the local ob-
servables of J, the reduced state ρJ, and the lo-
cal perception operators of overall observables.
For the dissipative term to preserve Tr(ρ), op-
erators{DJ
ρ,ρJ}must be traceless. To preserve
Tr(ρH)[and possibly other conserved properties
or charges, Tr(ρCk)], operators{DJ

(37)
where we recall that the second term in the
RHS can be put, for weak interactions and un-
der well-known assumptions, in Kossakowski-
Lindblad form.
Before introducing the SEA assumption, as
promised after Eq. (2), we note that for all pos-
sible choices ofDJ
ρ, Eq. (35) defines a broad
class of no-signaling nonlinear evolution equa-
tions. These form a broader class of nonlinear
laws which are not restricted by the sufficient but
notnecessaryconditionthat dρJ/dtbeafunction
ofρJonly.
Finally, one way to introduce the SEA as-
sumption in the spirit of the fourth law of ther-modynamics [32], i.e., to implement the maxi-
mum entropy production principle (MEPP) in
the present context [31], is to employ a varia-
tional principle.
9 General composite system version of
the SEA variational principle
For the purpose of this section, we adopt the for-
malism developed for this context in [17, 20, 25].
To easily impose the constraints of preservation
of non-negativity and self-adjointness of ρdur-
ing its time evolution, we define the generalized
square root of ρJ,γJ(t) =/radicalig
ρJ(t)U(Uany uni-
tary operator) so that,
ρJ=γJγ†
J. (38)

−{DJ
ρ,ρJ}= ˙γd
Jγ†
J+γJ˙γd†
J(39)
with ˙γd
J=−DJ
ργJ. (40)
Next, on the setL(HJ)of linear operators on HJ
we define the real inner product (·|·)
(X|Y) = Tr/parenleftig
X†Y+Y†X/parenrightig
/2, (41)
so that the unit trace condition for ρJrewrites
as(γJ|γJ) = 1, implying that the γJ’s lie on the
unitsphereinL(HJ). Theirtimeevolutions γJ(t)
follow trajectories on this sphere. Along these
trajectories, we can express the distance traveled
betweentandt+dtas
dℓJ=/radicalig
( ˙γJ|ˆGJ(γJ)|˙γJ)dt, (42)
where ˆGJ(γJ)is some real, dimensionless, sym-
metric, and positive-definite operator on L(HJ)
(superoperator on H) that plays the role of a lo-
cal metric tensor field (and may be a nonlinear
function of γJ).
The rates of change of the overall system en-
tropys(ρ), Eq.36, andoftheoverallsystemmean
value of conserved properties ck(ρ) = Tr(ρCk),
where [Ck,H] = 0, can be rewritten as

systems.
Finally we state the variational principle that
leadstoexpressionsforthe ˙γd
J’sandtheDJ
ρ’sthat
define the composite-system version of the SEA
equation of motion. The time evolution ensures
that the “direction of change” of the local trajec-
toryγJ(t), influenced by the dissipative part of
the dynamics, maximizes the local contribution
˙s|Jto the overall system’s entropy production
rate. This occurs under the constraints ˙ck|J= 0
that guarantee no local contribution to the rates
of change of the global constants of the motion.
Introducing Lagrange multipliers ϑJ

where the last constraint corresponds to the con-

This system can be solved explicitly for the ϑJ
k’s
using Cramer’s rule, to obtain convenient expres-
sions for the ˙γd
J’s as ratios of determinants (asin the original formulations). The ϑJ
k’s are non-
linear functionals of ρthat may be interpreted as
“local non-equilibrium entropic potentials” conju-
gated with the conserved properties. For exam-
ple, forC2=H, the Lagrange multiplier ϑJ
2plays
the role of “local non-equilibrium inverse temper-
ature” conjugated with the locally perceived en-
ergy, and for the stable equilibrium states of the
SEA dynamics it coincides with the thermody-
namic inverse temperature kBβJ(see below).
Similarly to what done in [31] for a non-
composite system, we define the “local non-
equilibrium affinity” operators
|ΛJ) =ˆG−1/2
J/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2(M)J
ργJ/parenrightig

so that the overall rate of entropy production be-
comes

(ΛJ|ΛJ)is the norm of 2(M)J

the “degree of disequilibrium” of subsystem J.
Hence, the necessary and sufficient condition for
the overall state to be locally non-dissipative (no
contribution to the overall entropy production

However, in order for the equation of motion
(37) to result independent of the unitary opera-
torsUused (inγJ=√ρJU) to define the gener-
alized square roots of the ρJ’s, we further restrict
thechoiceofthemetricsuperoperator ˆGJ. Weas-

The metric operator L−1

analogous to the symmetric thermal conductiv-
ity tensor ˆkin heat transfer theory. In that con-
text, ˆkdefines the general near-equilibrium linear
relationship,|q′′) =−ˆk|∇T), between the heat
flux vector q′′and the conjugated “degree of dis-
equilibrium” vector, i.e., the temperature gradi-
ent∇T. Here, Eq. (53) expresses a more gen-
eral linear relationship between the local evolu-
tionoperator ˙γd

ρ−/summationtext
kϑJ

ρ. This relation is
more general as it holds not only near equilib-
rium, but also anywhere far from equilibrium. In
the present quantum modeling context, it repre-
sents the nonlinear SEA extension into the far-
non-equilibrium domain of Onsager’s linear near-
equilibriumtheory,withreciprocitynaturallyem-
bedded through the symmetry of any metric. For
example, if LJcommutes with the local Hamil-
tonianHJ, its eigenvalues can assign different re-
laxation times to the local energy levels, captur-
ing their uneven contributions to the rate of local
energy redistribution described by the SEA dis-
sipatorDJ
ρ.
Like in heat transfer the conductivity tensor
for an isotropic material is ˆk=kˆI, here an anal-
ogous simplification is obtained when LJ=IJ,
the identity operator on HJ. This corresponds to
assuming a uniform Fisher-Rao metric.
Another noteworthy observation is that oper-
atorsCk, to be global constants of the motion
(or “charges”), must commute with the global
Hamiltonian operator H, but they need not com-
mute with each other. Therefore, the SEA for-
malism may find application also in the frame-
work of quantum thermodynamic resource theo-
ries that contemplate “non-commuting charges”
and “non-Abelian thermal states” as discussed in
Yunger Halpern et al.[11] and Murthy et al.[71].
10 Simplest composite-system SEA
equation of motion
For simplicity, we proceed by assuming: 1) a uni-
form Fisher-Rao metric, with ˆGJ=ˆIJ, so that
ˆGJ|X) =|X)andLJ=IJ; and 2) only two
global conserved properties: c1(ρ) = Tr(ρI)(the
normalization condition) and c2(ρ) = Tr(ρH)(mean energy conservation).
The first assumption allows to obtain

The second assumption, C1=IandC2=H,
together with definitions (12) and (13), allows to
write the SEA dissipators in the compact forms

As a result, the local evolution of each sub-
systemJis along the direction of steepest as-
cent of the locally perceived overall composite-
system entropy, compatible with the conservation
of the locally perceived overall composite-system
energy and the conditions of unit-trace and non-
negativity of the overall density operator ρ. The

showing clearly that it is non-negative since the
numerators in the summation are Gram determi-
nants. When the J’th term in the sum vanishes
we say that the local state ρJis “non-dissipative.”
If all local states are non-dissipative, then so is
the overall state ρ. A non-dissipative ρrepre-
sents an equilibrium state if it commutes with H,
otherwise it belongs to a unitary limit cycle of the
dynamics.
12Forρto be non-dissipative there must exist

VJJ= 0andµJJ= 0, Eq. (61) is satisfied by the
Gibbs states
ρJ= exp/parenleftbig−βJHJ/parenrightbig/Tr/bracketleftbigexp/parenleftbig−βJHJ/parenrightbig/bracketrightbig.(62)
Section 11.3 provides a numerical illustration
of local time evolutions that converge to limit cy-
cles obeying Eq. (61). These examples also illus-
trate another noteworthy possibility. Specifically,
without violating the no-signaling condition nor
the second-law principle of global entropy non-
decrease — which is always guaranteed by virtue
of Eq. (59) and the properties of Gram deter-
minants — it is possible that the local entropy
of a subsystem be decreasing during part of the
time evolution. Indeed, for correlated states, the
non-decrease of local entropy is not a second-law
requirement. We hope that the observation that
a local entropy decrease may be thermodynami-
cally consistent in the presence of strong entan-
glement will stimulate the design of experimental

Regarding no-signaling, we note that:
1. if subsystem Jis non-interacting, VJJ= 0,
then
∆(H)J
ρ=HJ−IJTr/parenleftbigρJHJ/parenrightbig= ∆HJ
and
(H,H )J
ρ= Tr/bracketleftig
ρJ(∆HJ)2/bracketrightig
depend only on the local HJandρJ;
2. ifJis uncorrelated, µJJ= 0, then
∆(Bln(ρ))J
ρ=Bln(ρJ)−IJTr/parenleftbigρJln/parenleftbigρJ/parenrightbig/parenrightbig
and
(Bln(ρ),Bln(ρ))J
ρ= Tr/bracketleftig
ρJ(ln/parenleftbigρJ/parenrightbig)2/bracketrightig
depend only on the local ρJ.Therefore, it is only when Jis both non-
interacting and uncorrelated that its local dissi-
pation operatorDJ
ρdepends only on the local HJ
andρJ. In this case the local equation of motion
Eq. (37) along with DJ
ρgiven by Eq. (57) reduces
exactly to the non-composite system version of
SEA evolution [16]. Instead, if Jis either inter-
acting or correlated, DJ
ρand, therefore, the local
nonlinear SEA evolution, according to Eqs. (37)
and (57), is determined not only by the local HJ
andρJ, but also by the local perceptions of the
overall Hamiltonian operator Hand/or the over-
all entropy operator Bln (ρ), nonetheless without
violating the no-signaling condition.
To prove no-signaling, assume that subsystem
Jis correlated but not interacting with any of
the subsystems in J. Now switch on an arbitrary
interaction that may involve the subsystems in J,
but not subsystem J, so that the only change in
the overall Hamiltonian His the term HJwhich
changes to H′
J. WithinJ, the locally perceived
deviation operators are ∆(H)J
ρand∆(Bln(ρ))J

andhencetheSEAdissipator DJ
ρaswellasallthe
terms in the RHS of Eq. (37) are not modified by
such change. Therefore, acting within Jmakes it
impossible to affect the time evolution of ρJand
any local observable of J.
We also mention the following in the spirit
of non-linear evolutions. In the case of a gen-
eral open quantum dynamics, the requirement
that a mapWt(ρ)be completely positive and
trace preserving (CPTP) is quite restrictive [72–
74]. In fact, the reduced dynamics of the subsys-
tem in interaction with the environment needs
not be CPTP [75–77]. Here, we define CPTP
as follows. IfM(ρs)is a map acting on a sub-
system in state ρs, which interacts with an ini-
tially uncorrelated environment in state ρE, and
is positive and trace preserving — meaning it
preserves the trace and ensures the evolved ma-
trix remains semi-definite (maintaining probabil-
ity conservation)— then M(ρs)is CPTP if and
only if the extended map Λ :M(ρs)⊗INremains
positive for all N’s [72]. As it has been argued
in the literature, the CPTP condition is restric-
tive because along with underlying assumption of
Markovianity, itrequirespreparationoftheinitial
state into a product state of system and environ-
ment. But, if there are strong initial correlations
between system and environment, or in fact, if
the evolution is non-Markovian in nature, then
13this requirement fails and we are forced to con-
sider PTP (positive and trace preserving) maps
only [78, 79]. Given that we are dealing with a
theory which does not restrict itself to Marko-
vian evolution, and that there is no imposition of
weak interaction between the subsystems, SEA
being PTP satisfies the requirements for a suit-
able nonlinear model of quantum thermodynam-
ics prohibiting signaling.
11 Non-interacting qubits
In extremal cases, Eq. (61) shows that even if
the subsystems are entangled, and therefore the
local states ρJare mixed, operators DJ
ρmay van-
ish. Eqs. (35) and (37) reduce to the standard
Schrödinger equation and the trajectory in state
space is a limit cycle of the SEA dynamics. A
noteworthy particular case is when the overall
system is in a pure state. Then, Bln (ρ) = 0and
standard unitary evolutions of pure states emerge
as limit cycles of the nonlinear SEA dynamics. In
this section we discuss a few less trivial examples,
to numerically illustrate, some general features of
Eq. (35) withDJ
ρgiven by Eq. (57).
We consider examples of mixed and correlated
initial states of a two-qubit composite ABthat
belong to the special class

i.e., the Bell diagonal states are non-dissipative
limit cycles of the nonlinear SEA dynamics un-
der any Hamiltonian. But most neighboring and
other states in the class defined by Eq. (63) are
dissipative, as we see in the following examples.
11.2 Separable, but correlated mixed states
For a simple example of correlated but separable
mixed states, assume Eq. (63) with ax=a,bz=
b, anday=az=bx=by=cx=cy=cz= 0, so
that

Hamiltonians HA=σzandHB=σx, we find

wheref,g, andpare defined as
f=η1−η2−η3+η4,
g=η1+η2−η3−η4,
p=η1−η2+η3−η4,(75)
so that the nonlinear evolution is clearly nontriv-
ial. However, it preserves the zero mean ener-
gies of both qubits, and while the overall entropy
increases and mutual information partially fades
away, it drives the overall state towards a non-
dissipativecorrelatedstatewithmaximallymixed
marginals. We proved above that signaling is im-
possible, even though DA
ρdepends not only on a
but also on b, andDB
ρona, which agrees with
our no-signaling condition in Eq. (2).

proach asymptotically the respective local Gibbs

cludes entangled mixed states, assume Eq. (63)
withax=az=a/√

ues ofρand those of its partial transpose are

passes both separable and entangled states. For
instance, considering a=−b(λ2=λ3), these

entangled for 1/4< b≤1/2. We compute ex-

so that again the nonlinear evolution is clearly
nontrivial in the sense that the local nonlinear
evolution of A(B) does not depend only on ρA

section, with parameter values aandbcorre-
sponding to the four points in Figure 3, Figures 4

non-interacting subsystems AandB.
Whereas for a separable initial state, Figure 4
shows that the local states approach the respec-
tive local Gibbs states, it is clear from Figures
5 that the presence of entanglement does not al-
low the local states to approach the respective lo-
cal Gibbs states. Indeed, the local evolutions ap-
proach non-dissipative unitary limit cycles where
{DA,ρA}= 0and{DB,ρB}= 0, and therefore
Eqs. (61) are satisfied. Without violating the
no-signaling condition, dissipation causes a (non
complete) reduction in mutual information and
coherence, while the Bell observable Tr(ρσx⊗σz)
and concurrence converge to steady state oscilla-
tions.
12 Conclusion
In this work, we explored the no-signaling prin-
ciple and its implications for nonlinear dynamics
17in quantum theory. We examined the measure-
theoretic representation of mixed ensembles, by
providing a consistent framework to handle non-
linearities and describe ensemble mixing unam-
biguously. This approach also offers a concep-
tual basis for developing nonlinear quantum dy-
namical models for non-equilibrium systems and
addressing unresolved questions about individual
quantum states. Additionally, we reviewed the
original philosophical motivations underlying the
steepest entropy ascent (SEA) nonlinear evolu-
tion law, which trades linearity for strong ther-
modynamic consistency.
Our analysis demonstrates that the SEA for-
malism provides a valid framework for describing
evolution or designing master equations. These
can be applied in nonlinear extensions of quan-
tum mechanics (QM) or in phenomenological
models of open quantum systems within quan-
tum thermodynamics. Our key focus was the
no-signaling principle. We introduced a crite-
rion for no-signaling based on local perception
operators (LPOs), a generalization of the tradi-
tional density-operator-based definition. Unlike
the conventional assumption that local evolution
depends solely on local properties, the SEA for-
malism incorporates the local effects of preex-
isting correlations and coherence through LPOs.
Our detailed examination of the foundations and
properties of LPOs highlights their potential as
key tools for constructing signaling-free, non-
linear, and non-local non-equilibrium dynamical
models, even outside of the SEA framework.
By inherently respecting the no-signaling con-
dition, the SEA formalism upholds the princi-
ple of causality and aligns with the axiomatic
paradigm proposed by Popescu and Rohrlich [86]
for quantum theories. Furthermore, the SEA ap-
proach addresses conceptual challenges such as
the Schrödinger-Park paradox, offering insights
into a thermodynamically consistent integration
of quantum mechanics and non-equilibrium ther-
modynamics. Related to the no-signaling prop-
erty, our discussion of LPOs and supporting nu-
merical examples strengthen the conjecture —
supported by prior numerical results from Cano-
Andrade et al.[26] — that SEA evolution is uni-
versally compatible with decoherence principles.
Specifically, SEA evolution ensures that correla-
tions and entanglement cannot build up between
non-interacting systems but can decay partiallyor completely, a process mediated by LPOs.
An intriguing implication of the SEA formal-
ismisitscompatibilitywiththermodynamicprin-
ciples while allowing for scenarios where, under
strong entanglement, the local entropy of a sub-
system may temporarily decrease during the evo-
lution, without violating the no-signaling condi-
tion nor the global entropy non-decrease dictated
by the second law.
We hope this study provides a foundational
basis for exploring applications of SEA model-
ing in quantum computing. Our comprehen-
sive approach and observations aim to stimu-
late constructive discussions and inspire further
studies, particularly in developing thermodynam-
ically consistent models for non-equilibrium pro-
cesses. These findings have potential applica-
tions in modeling the dynamics of quantum sys-
tems, advancing quantum technologies, and con-
tributing to the framework of quantum thermo-
dynamic resource theories, even beyond the SEA
paradigm.
