Abstract
Global surface water detection in very-high-resolution
(VHR) satellite imagery can directly serve major applica-
tions such as reﬁned ﬂood mapping and water resource as-
sessment. Although achievements have been made in de-
tecting surface water in small-size satellite images corre-
sponding to local geographic scales, datasets and methods
suitable for mapping and analyzing global surface water
have yet to be explored. To encourage the development of
this task and facilitate the implementation of relevant ap-
plications, we propose the GLH-water dataset that consists
of 250 satellite images and manually labeled surface water
annotations that are distributed globally and contain wa-
ter bodies exhibiting a wide variety of types ( e.g. , rivers,
lakes, and ponds in forests, irrigated ﬁelds, bare areas, and
urban areas). Each image is of the size 12,800 12,800
pixels at 0.3 meter spatial resolution. To build a benchmark
for GLH-water, we perform extensive experiments employ-
ing representative surface water detection models, popu-
lar semantic segmentation models, and ultra-high resolu-
tion segmentation models. Furthermore, we also design
a strong baseline with the novel pyramid consistency loss
(PCL) to initially explore this challenge. Finally, we imple-
ment the cross-dataset and pilot area generalization exper-
iments, and the superior performance illustrates the strong
generalization and practical application of GLH-water.

1. Introduction
As one of the fundamental components of the Earth’s
natural ecosystem, surface water plays a critical role in
maintaining biodiversity, ecological balance, and the devel-
opment of human societies [47]. Due to its wide spatial
and temporal distribution, using satellite imagery to detect
and map the global surface water is a feasible and conve-

ferent continents are selected and their image acquisition times and
scene descriptions are provided.
nient method, leading to promising breakthroughs that are
applied in the ﬂood mapping [33, 52], surface water changes
[13, 38], and other assessments of water resources [51, 17].
Compared to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) im-
agery, very-high-resolution (VHR) optical satellite imagery
(Ground Sampling Distance, GSD <5m) has the advantage
of providing clearer texture and detail information about
water. In contrast, medium- and low-resolution optical im-
ages can only detect large surface water bodies, while small-
scale water bodies and their intricate details can only be
captured by VHR optical satellite imagery.
To our knowledge, no publicly suitable data has been
proposed to effectively facilitate the training and evaluation
of surface water detection methods in global VHR optical
imagery, as highlighted in Table 1, which seriously hinders
the advancement of global VHR surface water body map-
ping tasks. In addition, the size of VHR satellite images of

Table 1. Characteristics of GLH-water dataset compared with other public datasets. The analysis demonstrates that the GLH-water
is the ﬁrst large-scale dataset for global surface water detection in large-size VHR optical satellite imagery. VHR means GSD <5m.
Large-size imagery means that size of each image is larger than 10,000 10,000 pixels. Large-scale dataset means the
total number of images is equivalent to more than 100,000 tiles of 512 512 pixels in size.
the whole scene is typically large ( e.g. , the standard scene
size of GaoFen-2 satellite images is approximately 6,000
6,000 pixels). Extracting complete and continuous water
bodies from large-size images poses not only a greater chal-
lenge that remains unexplored, but also is closer to practical
applications such as large-scale surface water mapping.
To promote research on this challenging task and to sup-
port applications like higher-resolution global surface wa-
ter mapping, we propose GLH-water , a large-scale dataset
for global surface water detection in large-size VHR optical
satellite imagery. We collect 250 VHR (GSD=0.3m) optical
satellite images of 12,800 12,800 pixels containing vari-
ous water types from the whole world, and create accurate
annotations through manual labeling and expert inspection,
as shown in Figure 1. GLH-water signiﬁcantly differs from
other existing datasets analyzed in Table 1, with advantages
focusing on the following aspects: (1) large-size images;
(2) a large number of samples; (3) extensive geographical
coverage of the samples; (4) broad temporal span of image
acquisition; (5) inclusion of diverse types of surface water.
These variations and traits give GLH-water its uniqueness
and present new challenges for detecting surface water from
large-size VHR optical satellite imagery.
Furthermore, to evaluate the dataset and explore this
challenging task, we evaluate the performance of repre-
sentative surface water detection models, well-performing
general semantic segmentation models and ultra-high reso-
lution segmentation methods on GLH-water , and combine
their metrics to create a benchmark. Motivated by multi-
layer visual ﬁeld difference of the image pyramid and the
topological continuity of surface water in large-size satel-
lite images, we propose a strong baseline with the new pyra-
mid consistency loss (PCL) to offer a promising pipeline for
this challenge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the strong generalization of GLH-water and its
potential application value. In summary, our contributions
are as follows:
• We present the ﬁrst large-scale dataset for global sur-
face water detection in large-size VHR optical satel-
lite imagery, which offers signiﬁcant advantages for
tackling the challenge of detecting surface water from
large-size satellite images that remains unexplored.• We evaluate a variety of semantic segmentation models
onGLH-water , including representative surface water
detection models, advanced segmentation models, and
ultra-high resolution segmentation algorithms, which
can serve as a benchmark for the development of future
methods.
• We further propose a novel strong baseline with the
PCL, which yields signiﬁcant improvements and sug-
gests that it will be a competitive pipeline for future
development.
In the future, GLH-water and strong baseline we pro-
posed are also expected to provide reliable training data and
models for manufacturing the global high-resolution sur-
face water map.

2.1. Relevant datasets
Surface water detection datasets. The upper portion of
Table 2 displays existing datasets speciﬁcally designed for
detecting surface water bodies. The majority of currently
available datasets [19, 21, 31, 40] for surface water de-
tection based on optical satellite imagery exhibit only low
to medium spatial resolution, as seen with Landsat-8 and
Sentinel-2 images. The resolution limitations of the images
result in the blurring and indistinguishability of small rivers
and lakes. To track intricate surface water systems, research
endeavors direct their experimental focus towards commer-
cial satellites that offer high resolution of up to 1m or even
0.3m, such as GeoEye and WorldView [37, 52]. Regret-
tably, owing to the policy constraints of commercial satel-
lites, these datasets will not be made available to the public
community and only be allowed to conduct private exper-
imental validation for their owners. In contrast, our GLH-
water is the ﬁrst publicly available large-scale dataset for
surface water detection from global VHR optical satellite
imagery.
Land use and land cover (LULC) datasets. As a funda-
mental application in the ﬁeld of remote sensing, datasets
related to LULC are extensively created and utilized, and
they commonly encompass the class of water. However,
they inadequately fulﬁll the need of tasks such as reﬁned

global surface water detection and mapping. The reason
is that none of them can simultaneously satisfy the trin-
ity of global sampling, VHR, and large-size imagery, as
demonstrated in the lower portion of Table 2. For exam-
ple, FBP [46] originates from the VHR and large-size im-
ages of GaoFen-2 satellite. However, it is conﬁned to a lim-
ited selection of cities in China, speciﬁcally Beijing, and
migration of the trained model to other regions presents a
challenge. Similarly, the geographic coverage of the Land-
cover.ai [1] is restricted to Poland, and the trained models
are limited in scale and generalizability. The image size of
DynamicEarthNet [44] is only 1,024×1,024 pixels, insuf-
ﬁcient to effectively portray the distribution of water bod-
ies, a characteristic with notable geospatial continuity. In
contrast, our GLH-water offers distinct advantages such as
global sampling, VHR, large-size imagery. These attributes
are essential for executing surface water mapping tasks on
a global scale.
2.2. Relevant methods
Surface water detection methods based on non-deep
learning algorithms. Normalized Difference Water Index
(NDWI) [34], Modiﬁed Normalized Difference Water In-
dex (MNDWI) [55], High Resolution Water Index (HRWI)
[56], Two-step Urban Water Index (TSUWI) [53], and other
threshold-based water indices are commonly proposed and
implemented in initial studies. However, their reliance on
spectral information result in a lack of consideration for
the spatial information present within the images. Addi-
tionally, shallow classiﬁers such as Support Vector Machine(SVM) and modiﬁed Statistical Region Merging (SRM) are
employed and show signiﬁcant improvements [60, 53, 42].
Surface water detection methods based on deep learn-
ing algorithms. The VHR optical satellite imagery com-
prises of a range of water bodies, including but not limited
to, rivers, lakes, and ponds with diverse sizes and shapes
[26]. Numerous studies [14, 57, 8, 23, 58] aim to enhance
the identiﬁcation of intricate water bodies by optimizing the
deep learning network, thereby enabling more efﬁcient uti-
lization of the multiscale characteristic. The meandering
of water body boundaries constitutes a critical hindrance to
the precise segmentation of surface water bodies. Miao et
al. [35] devise a loss function to derive accurate water body
boundaries, taking into account the distribution of bound-
ary weights. Efﬁcient post-processing algorithms [43, 6]
are also effective approaches.
2.3. Relevant applications
In the broader context of global water resource monitor-
ing and mapping, scholars create a worldwide 250m land
surface water body mask raster data employing MODIS
satellite images, grounded on the already existing global
land surface water body vector data [2]. The European
Commission Joint Research Centre (ECJRC) use Landsat-
5/7/8 satellite imagery to map global 30m water body data
products for the period 1984-2020 [38]. Global land cover
products which incorporate the water body category are
gradually emerging, albeit at a resolution of merely 10m
[22, 3, 24]. In addition, continuous production and appli-
cation of regional mapping products with low to medium
3resolution imagery for water bodies [50, 27, 16] and with
high resolution imagery for LULC [39, 28] is ongoing. The
inevitable trend in cartography is to continuously enhance
the spatial resolution of products, as this demonstrates the
beneﬁts of more detailed information. However, the pro-
duction of global VHR water cover maps remains a chal-
lenging task, due to the difﬁculty of acquiring and orga-
nizing VHR satellite data, the absence of publicly available
large-scale surface water detection datasets with manual an-
notation, and the lack of related models that are suitable
for large-size images. Our GLH-water with strong general-
ization and proposed strong baseline will ﬁll the aforemen-
tioned gap.
3. The GLH-water dataset
To ﬁll the lack of pertinent datasets and enhance the gen-
eralizability of segmentation models in detecting global sur-
face water, we ﬁrst present the GLH-water dataset that con-
tains 250 VHR (GSD=0.3m) satellite images with the size
of 12,800 × 12,800 pixels. These images are collected from
various locations worldwide and manual annotations are in-
cluded, as illustrated in Figure 1. In the remainder of this
section, we provide details on the imagery, annotations, and
advantages of our dataset.
3.1. Images collection and preprocessing
Using the Google Earth platform, we collect a total of
250 satellite images that are evenly distributed across the
globe, each with sizes of 12,800 × 12,800 pixels at 0.3m (19
level) spatial resolution, and encompassing approximately
3,686km2in geographic coverage. To guarantee the diver-
sity of the dataset, we handpick the geographic coordinates
and acquisition time of the sample data to ensure an ac-
curate representation of the various attributes of the global
water bodies.
3.2. Annotation method and inspection
The annotation labeling process includes three distinct
stages: ﬁne labeling, ﬁne checking and correction, and ran-
dom checking conducted by experts. To conduct ﬁne la-
beling, we initially employ the ArcGIS software to manu-
ally outline the boundaries of water bodies in the collected
images. In case of ambiguity in certain areas, we refer
to Google Maps of the corresponding areas to aid in the
labeling process. To ensure the accuracy of the annota-
tions, during the second phase, we concentrate on validating
the boundary accuracy, detecting any possible redundancies
and omissions, and rectifying each of the issues that sur-
faced during the inspection. Finally, the annotations accom-
panying each large-size image are cropped into 512 x 512
pixel tiles in order to accurately reﬂect their quality. A sec-
ond visual inspection is conducted by experts on a randomly
selected 15% of the data.After scrutiny and revision, no apparent erros are found
in the GLH-water dataset, and the standard of annotations is
high, which sufﬁciently fulﬁlls the necessities for the forth-
coming algorithmic evaluation. Some annotated samples in
our dataset are shown in Figure 2.
3.3. Advantage analysis
To the best of our knowledge, the GLH-water dataset is
the ﬁrst publicly available and largest dedicated datset for
global-scale surface water detection from large-size VHR
satellite imagery that meets the traits of global sampling,
VHR, and large image size. A comparison with other pub-
licly existing datasets is shown in Table 2.
Speciﬁcally, our GLH-water dataset has ﬁve remarkable
and important advantages:
•The size of samples is large. The size of each im-
age is up to 12,800 12,800 pixels, which is more in
line with the size of a whole scene image acquired by
satellite. It is also a challenge for existing methods.
•Inclusion of a large number of samples. After non-
overlapping cropping, a total of 156,250 tiles of 512
512 pixels in size and more than 40.96 billion la-
beled pixels are included, which is the largest dataset
for global surface water detection from large-size VHR
satellite imagery.
•The geographical coverage of the samples is ex-
tensive and evenly distributed. Figure 1 illustrates
the detailed geographic distribution, showing that data
points are present on all continents except Antarctica.
The geographic distribution is uniform and reasonable,
and can adequately represent the features of surface
water body worldwide. Therefore, models trained on
our dataset are expected to have stronger generalizabil-
ity in the geographical dimension.
•The temporal span of image acquisition is broad.
The range of acquisition time of data spans from 2011
to 2022, and each year contains a certain amount of
data. Models trained on this dataset exhibit greater
temporal generalization ability.
•Inclusion of a diverse type of surface water land-
scapes , as depicted in Figure 2. These include, but
are not limited to, lakes and rivers in the forest, grass-
land, ﬁeld, shrub, bare area, and urban area ,pools,
glacial lakes, and water in the special scenario . This
wide types of water bodies serves as a representation of
various geographic landscapes, land cover conditions,
water body shapes, and color tone types, thus provid-
ing a comprehensive reﬂection of the diversity of the
global surface water system.
In summary, the above ﬁve advantages drive GLH-water
dataset to be unique and advanced.

reﬂect the diversity of the global surface water system.
3.4. Dataset splits
To ensure that the training and test data are roughly
equally distributed, we randomly select 80% of the origi-
nal images as the training set, 10% as the validation set,
and 10% as the test set. We will make all original images
publicly available with annotations. From the geographical
distribution range shown in Figure 1, we can ﬁnd that the
validation and test sets are randomly distributed in various
regions of the world, which can well reﬂect the actual per-
formance of the model trained by this dataset.
4. Methods on GLH-water dataset
4.1. Baseline models
Many models are developed to consider the characteris-
tics of water bodies in VHR satellite images in the ﬁeld of
remote sensing, as outlined in Section 2.2. We choose three
representative models ( i.e., MECNet [61], MSResNet [9],
and MSCENet [23]) as baseline models. In the realm of
computer vision, numerous sophisticated semantic segmen-
tation models are perpetually created, which can easily be
adapted for satellite images. We use ﬁve advanced models,
namely PSPNet [62], DeepLab v3+ [4], HRNet [48], etc., to
construct the benchmark results. In addition, given the VHR
and the large size of images in GLH-water , we also eval-

uate the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms
speciﬁcally designed for ultra-high resolution images ( i.e.,
FCtL [25], MagNet [20], and ISDNet [18]).
4.2. A strong baseline with the PCL
We develop a competitive strong baseline with the new
PCL that is speciﬁcally designed to explore the detection
performance of surface water bodies in large-size VHR
satellite images. The pyramid consistency encompasses
the intra-layer consistency ( i.e., visual ﬁeld consistency
between pyramidal layers) and the inter-layer consistency
(i.e., spatial consistency within a pyramidal layer), as il-
5lustrated in Figure 3. To construct the image pyramid, we
downsample each original large-size image XHWat vary-
ing ratesfi;i=ng, resulting in a multi-layer represen-
tation. Considering computational cost and efﬁciency, we
adopt downsampling rates of 1, 1/5, and 1/25, generating
an image pyramid comprising three layers.
Inter-layer consistency. As mentioned in [36], the hu-
man brain may be inﬂuenced by the varying sizes of the vi-
sual ﬁeld being observed, potentially resulting in divergent
interpretations. The differences in attention maps of tiles
with distinct visual ﬁelds displayed in Figure 4(a) show that
the model is inﬂuenced by context information associated
with the visual ﬁeld. Motivated by this idea, we propose
the inter-layer consistency loss to calculate the discrimina-
tive variances of the model resulting from dissimilarities
in the visual range of patches. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the
small tiles in the original image ( i.e. tiles located in the ﬁrst
layer of the pyramid) xhw
1stas the fundamental units and es-
tablish inter-layer tile groups fx1st;x2nd;x3rdghwby up-
wardly mapping the corresponding tiles from various layers.
It is pertinent to note that while the size of each tile within
the tile group remains consistent and same, the visual ﬁeld
they contained is gradually increasing as shown in Figure 3.
The tile groups are trained by the encoder E, decoderD,
and classiﬁerCto obtain the corresponding sigmoid nor-
malized conﬁdence maps fp1st;p2nd;p3rdghw. Minimiz-
ing the differences between same regions in the conﬁdence
maps, which are caused by differences in the visual ﬁeld,
alleviates the visual ﬁeld bias that arises due to limited con-
textual information.
Intra-layer consistency. Slicing the original image for
processing may lead to the loss of contextual information
and interdependence between adjacent tiles, which poten-
tially disrupts the topological continuity of water bodies in
remote sensing images with a large size. Figure 4(b) im-
plies that the models exhibit differentiated attention for ad-
jacent tiles with overlaps. We argue that enforcing consis-
tency of the overlapping region on tiles with different con-
textual information helps to resume the continuity of water
bodies. Based on this challenge and motivation, we further
develop the intra-layer consistency loss to effectively model
the continuous relationship between neighboring tiles and
compensate for the information gap induced by image slic-
ing. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne four adjacent and overlapping
tiles as an intra-layer tile group fx1;x2;x3;x4ghw, and
their spatial relationships are depicted in Figure 3. All tile
pairsf(xi;xj);16i<j64gare processed by the en-
coderE, decoderD, and classiﬁerCto obtainsigmoid nor-
malized conﬁdence map pairs (pi;pj). The overlapping part
between them is employed to calculate the intra-layer con-
sistency loss.
Loss function. Inspired by the focal loss [29], we mod-
ify and present a novel consistency loss function to ef-

maps of tiles with different visual ﬁelds and overlapping tiles are
distinct in the same areas. Attention maps is obtained by the Grad-

5. Benchmark and experiment
5.1. Setup
Implementation details. To ensure the fairness of the eval-
uation, the batchsize of baseline models, except ultra-high
resolution segmentation methods, is set to 8 with a single
NVIDIA TITAN RTX GPU. The initial learning rate adopts
10 4. We crop the original image without overlap to 512
512 pixels and use the SGD optimizer with momentum
0.9, decayed weight 5×10 4to train baseline models for
15 epochs under a poly learning rate scheduler. To reduce
training costs and achieve faster convergence, we uniformly
use ImageNet [12] pre-trained backbones. For the imple-
mentation of ultra-high resolution segmentation methods,
we crop the image to 2,560 2,560 pixels and set suitable
parameter and hyperparameter settings refer to the settings
in their paper to ensure that trained models converge.
Due to GPU memory limitations, the batchsize of PCL
is set to 4. The other hyperparameters are the same as those
of baseline methods. The image pyramid is constructed in
three layers, and the default sampling rates are set to 1,
1/5, and 1/25 according to experimental experience. The
tile size of the ﬁrst pyramid layer is 512 512 pixels to
calculate the segmentation loss and the PCL. The trade-off
weightsinter andintra in Eq. (1) are both set to 1.0. r;
are set to 2 and 0.2, respectively.
Evaluation metrics. We use the intersection-over-union
(IoU) and F1-score metrics to evaluate the quantitative per-
formance of detecing surface water, following previous re-
lated work. In addition, we also use Frames Per Second
(FPS) and GPU Memory to evaluate the computational efﬁ-
ciency and consumption of different models.
5.2. Evaluation results
As described in Section 4, we evaluate 12 of the pop-
ular methods shown in Table 3. The accuracy of generic
semantic segmentation models is overall higher than that
of models designed speciﬁcally for surface water body de-
tection. In addition, the state-of-the-art methods perform-
ing on the Cityscapes [7],DeepGlobe [11], and Inria [32]
dataset ( i.e., MagNet [20] and ISDNet [18]) cannot achieve
satisfactory performance on the GLH-water dataset, which
proves that surface water detection in large-size VHR satel-
lite imagery is challenging and still needs further develop-
ment. Furthermore, our proposed PCL outperforms other
methods by leveraging the multi-layer ﬁeld of visual in-
formation present in large-size images and the topologicalMethod Backbone IoU(%) ( ") F1-score(%) (") FPS (") Memory(MB) ( #)

continuity of water bodies. Nonetheless, it suffers from
low efﬁciency and high computational cost, which are com-
mon issues faced by other ultra-high resolution segmenta-
tion methods ( i.e., FCtL [25] and ISDNet [18]). Thus, strik-
ing a balance between accuracy and efﬁciency should be
considered a crucial research priority in this task.
Table 4 demonstrates the consistent improvement of our
proposed strong baseline compared to the fair baseline ap-
proach across different segmentation model settings. This
indicates that our approach is an effective pipeline and is
driving progress in this task. Detailed visualization results
will be presented in the supplementary material.

tion we designed (Eqs. (2) and (3)) has superior capacity to
facilitate learning on hard-to-distinguish samples, thereby
resulting in performance improvement.
Impact of the number of image pyramid layers. We ob-
serve that if we only apply two layers of the image pyramid
to participate in training, our PCL will bring a performance
improvement of over 4.9% (Exps. V and VI). When build-
ing three layers of the image pyramid, we can see that there
is a 7.07% improvement (Exp. VII), indicating that more
layers being considered may be more beneﬁcial.
6. Generalization experiments on GLH-water
6.1. Cross-dataset generalization evaluation
Considering the similar resolution, data source, and large
image size, we choose the LoveDA [49] and DeepGlobe
dataset [11] to implement the cross-dataset generalization
evaluation. Following the data split of [49, 18], we use
DeepLab v3+-Res-50 as the segmentation model to train the
models and evaluate the cross-dataset performance.
As shown in Figure 5(a), there is little difference be-
tween the results of the model trained on GLH-water and
the model trained on LoveDA on the LoveDA test set
(68.15% vs. 69.27%). However, the performance of the
model trained on LoveDA is signiﬁcantly diminished when
transferred directly to the GLH-water test set (50.13% vs.79.80%). A similar situation occurrs between DeepGlobe
andGLH-water . Results in Figure 5(a) and (b) conﬁrm the
strong generalization of our GLH-water .
6.2. Pilot area generalization evaluation
Providing data support for future VHR global surface
water mapping is one of the motivations for constructing
theGLH-water . We select the Yangpu District of Shanghai,
China, which is independent of the dataset and annotated
by experts, as a pilot area (60.61 km2) to further discuss
the generalization of GLH-water .
Based on the results presented in Figure 5(c) and (d), it
is evident that the model trained on GLH-water exhibits su-
perior performance (75.99%) in the surface water mapping
task in the pilot area, surpassing the models trained on other
datasets. These ﬁndings suggest that GLH-water holds sig-
niﬁcant potential for global-scale VHR surface water map-
ping, owing to its strong generalization.
7. Qualitative results
Qualitative results on GLH-water test andval sets.
Figures 6 and 7 show the surface water detection visualiza-
tion results of the 12 methods included in the benchmark
on the test set and validation set of GLH-water , re-
spectively. Compared with other results, our PCL can better
preserve more continuous and complete surface water bod-
ies and reduce commission errors, as shown in (n) of Fig-
ure 6. In addition, our PCL can detect small and slim rivers,
as shown in (n) of Figure 7.
Qualitative results about cross-dataset generalization
evaluation. Figures 8 and 9 display the visualization re-
sults on the DeepGlobe [10] and LoveDA [49]test sets
of models trained on different datasets, respectively. As
shown in the quantitative results presented in our paper
(IoU: 74.43% vs. 79.1% and 68.15% vs. 69.27%), thanks to
the strong generalization of GLH-water , the model trained
on the GLH-water train set achieves performance on the
DeepGlobe andLoveDA test sets that is not signiﬁcantly
8different from the performance of the model trained on their
respective train sets.
Qualitative results on pilot area. Figure 10 shows the
performance of our model trained on GLH-water dataset
for surface water detection in an out-of-sample pilot area
(Yangpu District, Shanghai, China). The model trained on
GLH-water exhibits superior performance (75.99%) in the
surface water mapping task in this pilot area, surpassing
the models trained on DeepGlobe [10], 2020 GF challenge
[43], and LoveDA [49] datasets. Additionally, Figure 10
also demonstrates that our model’s ability to detect slender
streams in urban scenes and resist the interference of build-
ing shadow is limited. These limitations should be consid-
ered as future research priorities for surface water detection
from large-size VHR satellite imagery.
8. Conclusion
We present a global large-scale dataset for surface wa-
ter detection in large-size VHR satellite imagery which is
ﬁrst publicly available dataset in this task. Unlike exisit-
ing datasets, we collect 250 large-size satellite images con-
taining various surface water scenes across the whole earth
and carefully annotate their masks. Considering the advan-
tages of GLH-water over other datasets, we believe that this
dataset is more appropriate for practical applications and
more challenging. Additionally, we build a benchmark to
evaluate advanced segmentation models in the ﬁelds of re-
mote sensing and computer vision. we aslo propose a strong
basline with PCL that is a promising research pipeline to
push this task forward.
In the future, we hope the GLH-water with strong
generalization will not only evaluate the progress of algo-
rithms, but also provide data to support major studies such
as global surface water mapping and even global water
resource conservation and management.
