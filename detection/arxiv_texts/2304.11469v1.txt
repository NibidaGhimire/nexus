Abstract. A compact space Yis called homeo-product-minimal if given any
minimal system (X,T), it admits a homeomorphism S:Y→Y, such that
the product system (X×Y,T×S)is minimal. We show that a large class of
cofrontiers is homeo-product-minimal. This class contain s R. H. Bing’s pseudo-
circle, answering a question of Dirbák, Snoha and Špitalský from [ Minimal
direct products , Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 375 (2022)].
1.Introduction
The present paper concerns the notion of homeo-product-min imality, recently
introduced by Dirbák, Snoha and Špitalský in [9]. A compact s paceYis called
homeo-product-minimal if given any minimal, metric but not necessarily compact
system(X,T),Yadmits a homeomorphism S:Y→Y, such that the product
system(X×Y,T×S)is minimal. The aforementioned authors showed ([9, Theorem
B]) that the following spaces are homeo-product-minimal:
(1) every compact connected metrizable abelian group,
(2) every space of the form Y×Z, whereYis a nondegenerate homeo-product-
minimal space and Zis a compact metrizable space admitting a minimal
action of an arc-wise connected topological group,
(3) every quotient space (Γ×Z)/Λ, obtained from Γ×Zby applying the
diagonal action of Λ, whereΓis an inﬁnite compact connected metrizable
abelian group, Λis a ﬁnite subgroup of ΓandZis a compact connected
(not necessary abelian) metrizable group, on which the grou pΛacts by
automorphism,
(4) the Klein bottle,
(5) the Cantor space,
(6) the Sierpiński curve on the 2-torus and the Sierpiński curve on the Klein
bottle,
(7) every compact metrizable space Yadmitting a minimal continuous ﬂow
whose centralizer in the group of homeomorphisms of Yacts transitively
onYin the algebraic sense,
(8) every compact connected manifold Ywithout boundary admitting a free
action of a nontrivial compact connected Lie group,
(9) all odd-dimensional spheres and compact connected Lie g roups,
(10) every cantoroid.
The introduction of the notion of homeo-product-minimalit y was motivated by the
fact, that there exist minimal spaces, whose Cartesian powe rs do not admit minimal
homeomorphisms [5].
Among the open questions raised by the authors in [9], was the one asking if
R. H. Bing’s pseudo-circle is homeo-product-minimal [9, Pr oblem 4]. The pseudo-
circle is a fractal-like object, arising both in topology an d dynamics. For example,
R2\{(0,0)}admits a continuous decomposition into pseudo-circles, wh ose decom-
position space is homeomorphic with R[7] (see also [2])). In dynamics, it appears
in rotation theory [3], as well as smooth [13], [14], [15], [1 1], and complex dynamics

[8]. The question concerning homeo-product-minimality of the pseudo-circle seems
well motivated, since the pseudo-circle admits minimal hom eomorphisms [11] and
minimal noninvertible maps [6]. It also shares many propert ies with the circle,
admitting homeomorphisms that are well-approximated by ri gid rotations of the
annulus. However, its homeomorphism group is far from the on e of the circle. For
example, the action of the group on the pseudo-circle has unc ountably many or-
bits [12], contains minimal homeomorphisms that are weakly mixing [11] (unlike
the circle), and does not contain any connected nondegenera te compact subsets
[16]. Nonetheless, in the present paper we show that the pseu do-circle is indeed
homeo-product-minimal, a property it shares with a class of planar cofrontiers, the
so-called HAK attractors [4]. In the next section we recall t he construction of these
objects, which we shall use in Section 3 to answer the aforeme ntioned question.
As noted by Handel in [11], the construction is ﬂexible enoug h, to allow the in-
troduction of crookedness, which guarantees that the resul ting HAK attractor is a
pseudo-circle, giving us the following result, which in tur n provides an aﬃrmative
answer to the [9, Problem 4] mentioned above.
Theorem 1.1. The pseudo-circle is homeo-product-minimal.
2.Preliminaries
Adynamical system is a pair (X,T), whereXis metrizable and T:X→Xis
a continuous map. In particular we do not require the usual as sumption that Xis
a compact space. We adapt this more general approach from [9] since deﬁnition of
homeo-product-minimality require it. Dynamical system is minimal if there is no
proper nonempty, closed and T-invariant subset M⊂X, in which case map Tis
called minimal. Note that a system is minimal if and only if ω-limit set of a point
x∈X, denoted ωT(x), is the whole space Xfor allx∈X, whereωT(x)is the set
of all limit points of the trajectory {Tn(x)}n≥0. Recall that a compact space Y
is called homeo-product-minimal if given any minimal, metric but not necessarily
compact system (X,T),Yadmits a homeomorphism S:Y→Y, such that the
product system (X×Y,T×S)is minimal.
By acontinuum we mean compact, connected metric space and any subset of a
continuum which is a continuum itself is referred to as subcontinuum . A continuum
isindecomposable if it cannot be presented as the union of two proper subcontin ua
andhereditarily indecomposable if every compact connected subset of a continuum
is indecomposable. The main object of our interest is the pse udo-circle constructed
by Bing in [1], which is a hereditarily indecomposable conti nuum.
LetS1denote the unit circle. For any θ∈Rand the circle S1we denote by
Rθ:S1∋x/mapsto→x+θmod 1∈S1the rotation map. It is clear that if we ﬁx
someα∈R\Qand a sequence {qk}k≥0⊂Qconverging to α, then the sequence
of rotations {Rqk}k≥0converges to Rαin the space of self homeomorphisms of the
circle.
Take the annulus A= [0,1]×R/Zand byπi,i= 1,2denote the projection of A
onto itsi-th factor; that is for any t= (t1,t2)∈Awe have π1(t) =t1∈[0,1]and
π2(t) =t2∈R/Z.
For any compact metric space (X,d)and continuous maps F,G:X→Xwe
deﬁne the following metric:
ρ(F,G) = sup
x∈Xd(F(x),G(x)).
The proof of our main Theorem 3.5 is motivated by the construc tion of so-
called HAK homeomorphism (Handel-Anosov-Katok homeomorp hism) of annulus
A. We say that a homeomorphism H:A→Ais aHAK homeomorphism ifHis

homeomorphisms {Hn}n≥0. Below we recall the main ideas of the construction of
sequence {Hn}n≥0after the authors of [4]. For more details we refer the reader to
[11] and [4].
Construction of HAK homeomorphism:
(1) Start with a decreasing sequence of closed annuli {An}n∈Nassuming A0=
A, such that A1⊂IntA. For every n∈Nletfn:An→Abe a homeo-
morphism with the property that π1(f(c))≤εn

enough. In fact we choose εnforn∈Nin such a way that/summationtext∞
i=0εiis
convergent (see section 2.1.1 in [4]).
(2) For each nwe take the rational rotation Rn:A→Aof period pnsuch
that there exists a rectangle Dn= [0,1]×[0,αn]with the property that
Ri
n(Dn),Rj
n(Dn)are either equal or have disjoint interiors, A=/uniontext
i∈ZRi
n(Dn)
andαn< δn, whereδnis chosen by the uniform continuiuty of f−1

4.
We assume that pn+1< pnfor anyn∈N.
(3) For each n∈Nwe deﬁne a homeomorphism gn:A→Awhich is εn-close
to identity and:
gn|An=f−1
n◦Rn◦fn,
whilegn|A\An−1= id.
(4) For every n∈Nwe deﬁne the homeomorphism Hn:A→Aas follows:
Hn=gn◦gn−1◦···◦g1.
The approximation scheme presented in [4] assures also that Hn(An+1)⊂IntAn+1
andρ(Hi
n,Hi
n+1)< εnfori= 1...,mp nfor some m≥1. As a result, the authors
obtain that {Hn}n∈Nis a Cauchy sequence, so it converges to some homeomorphism
H, together with H-invariance of each An.Denoting C=/intersectiontext
n∈NAnwe have that C
is closed and H-invariant as well. In fact it is an attracting set of Hand we will
refer to it as HAK attractor of the HAK homeomorphism H.
3.Homeo-product-minimality
Throughout this section we always assume that (X,T)is a minimal dynamical
system, where Xis metric, but not necessarily compact.
The following Lemma 3.1 is standard. We state it without proo f.
Lemma 3.1. LetF:Z→Zbe a continuous map on a compact metric space Z.
Then for any continuous map G:Z→Z,K >0andε >0there exists γ >0such
that ifρ(F,G)< γthenρ(Fj,Gj)< εforj= 0,...K .
Remark 3.2. By the Weyl’s theorem (see for example [18]) we have that for any se-
quence{xn}n∈Nof distinct integers the sequence {αxn}n∈Nis uniformly distributed
mod 1 for almost all α∈R. Using this result and repeating the reasoning presented
in the proof of [17, Proposition 1] we have that the set of α∈R\Qsuch that T×Rα
is minimal is of full Lebesgue measure, where (X,T)is a minimal dynamical system
andRα:S1→S1is the irrational rotation of the circle.
The following fact is a standard consequence of minimality. We present its proof
for completeness.
Lemma 3.3. Fix any x0∈X. LetRα:S1→S1be a rotation on the circle S1,
withα∈R\Qsuch that T×Rαis minimal. For any ε >0there exists K >0
such that for every t,s∈S1there isj < K such that:

we have d/parenleftbig

In the proof of the theorem presented below we will use the app roximation scheme
of HAK homeomorphism H:A→Abased on the one presented in section 2.

Corollary 3.6. For every minimal system (X,T)there is an embedding of pseudo-
circleCin annulus Aand the homeomorphism H:A→Asuch that H(C) =C,
(C,H|C)is minimal and (X×C,T×H|C)is minimal.
Now, Theorem 1.1 is an immediate corollary as shown below.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. The proof is an consequence of Theorem 3.5 and the fact
that the pseudo-circle is topologically unique (see [10]). Namely, it is enough to
repeat a standard argument for disjointness (see [17, Propo sition 1]). Let us ﬁx
anyx0∈X. Then Theorem 3.5 implies that there is a map Hon the pseudocircle
Csuch that ωT×H(x0,y)⊃ {x0} × C for every y∈ C. ButωT×H(x0,y)is closed,
invariant, and x0has dense orbit in XunderT, henceωT×H(x0,y) =X× C
for anyy∈ C. To complete the proof, observe that by minimality of T, for any
(x,t)∈X× Cthere iss∈ Csuch that (x0,s)∈ωT×H(x,t), which implies that
X×C=ωT×H(x0,s)⊂ωT×H(x,t). /square
Note that it is still an open question whether all real number s can be realized as
rotation numbers of minimal pseudo-circle homeomorphisms and, with the excep-
tion for integer multiples of the same number, if two such num bers can be realized
on the same embedding (see [4] for more details). This motiva tes the following
question.
Question 3.7. Is there an embedding Cof the pseudo-circle into annulus Asuch
that for any minimal system (X,T)there is a homeomorphism H:A→Asuch
thatH(C) =C,(C,H)is minimal and (X×C,T×H|C)is minimal?
Note also that if we denote by Cnthe boundary circle of each annulus Anfrom
the construction in the proof of Theorem 3.5, then {Cn}n∈Nconverges in Hausdorﬀ
metric to the pseudo-circle C. In particular each Cnis homeo-product-minimal and
so is the limit C. On the other hand, in plain it is easy to obtain arc as the limi t of
converging sequence of circles. This leads to the following question:
Question 3.8. Take any m∈Nand a sequence {Yn}n∈Nof homeo-product-
minimal spaces, where Yn⊂Rmforn∈N. LetYbe the limit of Ynin the
Hausdorﬀ metric. Under what conditions Yis a homeo-product-minimal space?
