1 INTRODUCTION
The velocities of neutron stars are in several occasions rather high,
with average values reaching up to 200-500 kms(Lyne & Lorimer
1994;Cordes&Chernoﬀ1998;Lorimeretal.1997),whileinsome
casestheyareexceeding 1000 kms(Chatterjeeetal.2005).Recently,
Gaia Data Release 2 has provided precise parallax measurements,
and the velocities of many pulsars have been estimated to belong in
a wide range of speeds (Yang et al. 2021). Since the progenitors of
pulsarsarebelievedtohavesmallerspacevelocities(Blaauw1985),
aphysicalexplanationonhowsomepulsarsobtainhighvelocities,is
the assumption that there was an eﬀect of a kick mechanism on the
star (Coleman & Burrows 2022), either at its birth (Igoshev 2020;
Igoshev et al. 2021), or at some following phase of the pulsar’s life
(Bailes 1989).
Some of the main kick-models that have been proposed are the
following: A velocity kick can be generated by hydrodynamic insta-
bilities which occur during the core collapse of the proto-neutron
star or during a supernova explosion (Nakamura et al. 2019; Bur-
rows et al. 1995; Herant et al. 1994). During the collapse of the
star, uneven disturbances appear in its outer remaining core of iron,
which are ampliﬁed by gravity. These enhanced disturbances lead
to sharp propagation of shocks that have as a result the appearance
of kick. Janka & Müller (1994) performed 3-dimensional hydrody-
namicalsimulationsoftheevolutionoftheperturbationsastheyare
transportedtotheouterregionsoftheneutronstars.Theyfoundthat
★E-mail: v.agalianou@uoi.gr (VA)
yE-mail: kngourg@upatras.gr (KNG)these velocity kicks can hardly exceed 100 kms, since the convec-
tive blobs, which carry the radiated energy, do not cause signiﬁcant
anisotropies.Theestimatedtimescalesofhydrodynamickicksis0.1
s, for a typical neutron star when the perturbations travel fast (Bur-
rows&Hayes1996),andforthismechanismtobeviable,amassive
progenitorisrequired(Jankaetal.2022).Formostkickmechanisms,
a spin-velocity alignment is expected, which is a phenomenon that
has been best studied for the cases of Vela and Crab pulsars but
also for other pulsars (Johnston et al. 2005). This spin-kick veloc-
ity correlation can be studied with pulsar wind nebula observations
or by using the linear polarization proﬁle of radio emission (Wang
et al. 2007). For the hydrodynamic kick the spin-kick alignment is
disputed if the timescale of the kick is smaller than the spin period
of the pulsar (Lai et al. 2001).
An alternate mechanism that has been proposed is acceleration
duetoneutrinoemissionbecauseofthepresenceofstrongmagnetic
ﬁelds (Nagakura et al. 2020; Wongwathanarat et al. 2013; Colpi &
Wasserman 2002). Asymmetric neutrino ﬂux can be generated in
the outer regions of the star, where the neutrino distribution devi-
ates from thermal equilibrium (Vilenkin 1995). Arras & Lai (1999)
found that the kick velocity induced by this mechanism is 50𝐵15
kms, where𝐵=1015𝐵15G, is the local magnetic ﬁeld strength.

studied the eﬀect of neutrino-driven kicks on the supernova explo-
sion mechanism, and found that they can increase signiﬁcantly the
energyofanasymmetricexplosion,providedthatthemagneticﬁeld
strength is magnetar-level while the timescale for this kick mecha-
nism is just a few seconds (Laiet al. 2001). Moreover, some models

proposekicksthatresultfromthecombinationofthetwolastmecha-
nisms,i.e.,thekicksduetosupernovaexplosionsandtheasymmetric
neutrino emission (Stockinger et al. 2020; Burrows et al. 2020). For

the main kick mechanisms and predictions in Table 1.
Another candidate mechanism that has been proposed to explain
neutronstaracceleration,istheelectromagnetickickorrocketeﬀect
mechanism, which is the main subject of this paper and was ﬁrst in-
troducedbyHarrison&Tademaru(1975).Theelectromagnetickick
mechanismrequiresastrongmagneticﬁeldwhichisdisplacedfrom
the center of the neutron star and may have multipolar components.
Due to this oﬀset magnetic ﬁeld, an asymmetric electromagnetic
emission is expected, therefore a radiation reaction force in the di-
rection of the spin axis acts onto the star and eventually accelerates
it.Forthismodel,thespin-kickalignmentisexpected.Thatisdueto
the fact, that the electromagnetic force that accelerates the star acts
like a recoil, and appears because of the emission of radiation. So
even though this emitted radiation is not aligned with the magnetic
axis, it will be aligned with the spin axis. Recently, observations of
the pulse shape of pulsar PSR J0030+0451, that were obtained by
NICERobservatoryinX-raysandFermi-LATingamma-rays(Miller
et al. 2019; Riley et al. 2019), revealed that the morphology of the
star’s hot spots and polar caps imply an non-centered dipole mag-
netic ﬁeld which could have multipole components. As shown by
Kalapotharakosetal.(2021),tointerpretthesemorphologies,pulsar
J0030+0451 may have a magnetic ﬁeld which can be described by
a variety of forms, which in general are consisted of an oﬀset mag-
netic dipole moment and an oﬀset quadrupole magnetic moment.
Since this ﬁrst direct observation of an oﬀ-centred magnetic ﬁeld,
the rocket eﬀect mechanism should be taken into consideration as
one viable candidate for the acceleration of neutron stars.
In addition to the acceleration of neutron stars, the rocket eﬀect
mechanism predicts that the thrust imparted (the kick velocity vec-
tor) will be parallel to the neutron star’s axis of rotation (spin-kick
alignment). Recently, Yao et al. (2021) presented the ﬁrst case of
three-dimensional alignment of the spin axis with the vector of the
pulsar’s spatial velocity. This work was based on observations by
the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST)
(NAN et al. 2011). By observing the polarization of the radiation
emitted by the star, they determined both the transverse and radial
velocity of the pulsar, but also showed that the rotational axis is ap-
proximately aligned with the velocity vector, forming a slight slope
of almost 10 degrees. Such an observation further reinforces the
relevance of the study of the rocket eﬀect mechanism.
Beyond the context of neutron stars, oﬀ-centred dipole magnetic
ﬁelds have been presented by Kemp et al. (1970) for white dwarfs.
Recently Hollands et al. (2023), modeled the magnetic ﬁeld of the
whitedwarfSDSSJ1143+6615asanoﬀsetdipolebasedonobserva-
tionaldata.Moreover,researchhasbeendoneontheelectromagnetic
ﬁelds that develop near the surface of neutron stars. Speciﬁcally,
Gourgouliatos&Cumming(2013)showedthattheHalleﬀectatthe
neutron star’s crust produces quadrupolar and multipolar magnetic
ﬁeldcomponents,withmorecomplexbehaviourappearinginthree-
dimensional studies (Gourgouliatos et al. 2016; Gourgouliatos &
Hollerbach 2017). Apart from white dwarfs and neutron stars, there
havebeenevidenceofanoﬀsetandmultipolarmagneticﬁeldtoexist
on planets too, as Uranus and Neptune (Ness et al. 1986, 1989) and
the magnetospheric structure of Jupiter Komesaroﬀ & McCulloch
(1976). So, it appears, that multipolar and oﬀset magnetic ﬁelds are
likely to appear in several astrophysical objects even though assum-

ing a centered dipole magnetic ﬁeld simpliﬁes the calculations and
simulations that one can do.
In this paper we apply the rocket eﬀect model on a sample popu-
lation of neutron stars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs)
and we export results about the values of the braking indices of the
pulsars and their kick velocities. The structure of the paper is as
follows: in Section 2, we describe the rocket eﬀect as ﬁrst proposed
by Harrison & Tademaru (1975) and we present an alternate model
whichistime-dependedandexplicitlydependsonthemagneticﬁeld

velocity kicks and show the results of Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC)analysis,wherewealsoestimatetherangeofvaluesofthe

in Section 4.

by Harrison & Tademaru (1975) who suggested that a pulsar can be
acceleratedduetoemissionofasymmetricelectromagneticradiation.

that for this model to be eﬃcient and able to explain the current
pulsar velocities we must consider a very small initial spin period.
Thereforeweexpectthismechanismtoappearinyoungmillisecond

2.2 The time dependence of the kick - An alternate model
In this section we further develop the electromagnetic kick mecha-
nism to account for the spin-down of the star and the initial period.
Thus we assume that the acceleration of the neutron star is only due
to the force Fgiven by equation A11 (see appendix). We further
assume that the intensity and direction of the magnetic ﬁeld do not
evolvewithtime.Moreover,weincludethetemporalevolutionofthe
mechanism, since time is a parameter that has not been taken into
account in the initial rocket eﬀect model. Starting from Newton’s
second law:

of the spin period, we can integrate from 𝑡=0, for the birth of
the pulsar, until the age of the supernova remnant 𝜏𝑆𝑁𝑅which is

the population of pulsars for which we apply these two models.
2.3 Sample of pulsars
In this section we discuss the sample of neutron stars on which we
focus our analysis. We chose a sample of young neutron stars, since
weexpectthemtohavesmallspinperiodsandstrongmagneticﬁelds,
thatareassociatedwithSNRs.Wealsoneededanindicationfortheir
current space velocity, so we focused on collecting their radial or
transverse velocity. Since the determination of the radial velocity
is often diﬃcult due to the intense broadening of the spectral lines
becauseofthestrongmagneticﬁeldofapulsar(Lovisetal.2010),we
focusonthetransversevelocity( 𝑉𝑡)whichwederivefromtheATNF
catalogue(Manchesteretal.2005),alongwithotherparameterssuch

and the periods derivative. Since these pulsars are associated with
SNRs it was important to have an estimate of the age of each SNR
(𝜏𝑆𝑁𝑅).Forthisanalysisweusedaseriesofpreviousworks(Igoshev
et al. 2022; Suzuki et al. 2021; Ferrand & Saﬁ-Harb 2012) and

the transverse velocity along with the age of the hosting supernova
remnant is known, or the braking index has been measured using
a timing solution. We focus on the value of the braking indices,
since it is a good indication for the diﬀerent spin-down mechanisms
that can decelerate a pulsar. This quantity constitutes a guide to
draw conclusions on the evolution of the rotation of a neutron star
(Livingstone et al. 2006). In section 2.5 this characteristic quantity
isdiscussedfurther.Thetwosamplesarepresentedintables2,3.In

InthisdiagramwecanseethataccordingtotheATNFcatalogue,
the sample includes pulsars that are associated with SNRs except
two of them, which appear as black dots. These two neutron stars
are J0205+6449 and J1809-1917, which according to the SNRcat
(Ferrand & Saﬁ-Harb 2012) are associated to SNRs as shown in
Table 2. In addition two of these stars are characterized as "Radio
Quiet"(appearasbluetriangles)i.e.,wedonotobservethemthrough
the radio emission, while 7 of them have a strong emission in radio
waves and are referred to as "Radio-IR Emission” (shown as yellow

ﬁelds that reach up to 1012G.

Inaddition,Haenseletal.(1999)madeanestimationoftheminimum
spin period ( 𝑃=0288 ms) without however taking into account
a speciﬁc equation of state for the neutron star. From population
studies, Igoshev et al. (2022) found that for neutron stars in SNRs,
the initial spin period can be described by a log-normal distribution
with𝜇𝑙𝑜𝑔¹𝑃𝑠º= 104i.e.𝑃=0091 sand𝜎𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑃=053.
Contrary to these studies, by using radio polarization, Lorimer
et al. (1993) proposed that radio pulsars are born with spin periods
of0.02-0.5s,whichindicateaslowrotation,whichwouldnotallow
fortherocketeﬀecttohaveanyimpact.Ingeneral,thedetermination

pulsars that are associated with SNRs for which at least an indepen-
dent estimate of the age exists. It is known that the initial rotational

tionfortheinitialspinperiodsforapopulationofpulsarsassociated

is higher than the SNR age they follow a distribution with mean
value of 0091s, whereas for several sources, the SNR age is longer

than the characteristic age and such an estimate is not feasible. For
our analysis we use the same methodology as Igoshev et al. (2022):
we calculate the initial spin period we use equation 3 but instead of
the characteristic age of the pulsar, we replace it with the age of the
SNR. For the cases where characteristic age is greater than the age
of the SNR and the equation above would lead to a negative square
root, we assume that the initial rotation period is as low as 𝑃𝑖𝑛=2
msor𝑃𝑖𝑛=1 ms. The fact that the square root is negative could
be explained by two scenarios: the SNR age is overestimated or the
pulsar was slowing down with a smaller rate in the past. Based on
that we calculate the kick velocity derived from equation 6 using
the approach described above and the methodology described in the
previous paragraph using equation 1.
2.5 Braking indices
As mentioned above one signiﬁcant parameter is the braking index
for a pulsar. Speciﬁcally we can, depending on its value, draw some
conclusions about the mechanism that leads to the spinning-down
of neutron stars. Therefore in this paragraph, we will focus on the
brakingindexwithintheframeworkofthetheoryofelectromagnetic
kick.Consideringthattheangularvelocity 𝜔ofneutronstarsevolves
as¤𝜔𝜔𝑛, where𝑛is the braking index, then we can derive to the
equation which gives the braking index (Livingstone et al. 2006):
𝑛=𝜔¥𝜔
¤𝜔2
where¥𝜔is the second derivative of the angular velocity. Assuming
that pulsar spin-down is due to a dipolar magnetic ﬁeld, while other
physicalparameters (momentofinertia,magnetic ﬁeldstrength,an-
gle between the magnetic dipole axis and the spin axis) remain un-
changed, leads to the canonical value 𝑛=3. However, as shown
in Table 3 several pulsars have braking indices that deviate from
thecanonicalvaluewithextremeexamplesbeingpulsarJ1809-1917
with a braking index 235and pulsar J1801-2451, with a braking
index 11(Parthasarathyetal.2020).Inreality,themagneticﬁeldof
apulsarmayhaveacomplexstructure,whichcanresulttoadiﬀerent
valueforthebrakingindex.Alsothespin-downratemaybeaﬀected
by other factors, such as the presence of a relativistic wind (Menou
et al. 2001), moment of inertia evolution (Ho & Andersson 2012),
magneticﬁeldevolution(Gourgouliatos&Cumming2015)oremis-
sionofgravitationalwaves(deAraujoetal.2016).Theseadditional
factors can cause the pulsar to spin down at a rate that leads to a
braking index 𝑛≠3. Here, we explore whether an oﬀset magnetic
ﬁeld can be related to the measured braking indices.
For this analysis we consider another sample of neutron stars for
which the braking index values are known, to compare these values
with the ones that arise if pulsars have a displaced magnetic ﬁeld
from their center. We use as a guide the work of Pétri (2016), who
developed analytical solutions for the electromagnetic ﬁelds outside
a neutron star for a vacuum magnetosphere and an oﬀ-axis dipolar
or multipolar magnetic ﬁeld. The methodology used there is similar
to the one we follow here, since ﬁrst a multipole expansions for the
ﬁelds is performed, with the use of spherical harmonic functions,
then integrating for the Poynting ﬂow the spin-down luminosity is

to compare the value of the braking index obtained from the above

In Table 4, the results for the kick velocity are quite diﬀerent for

J1813-1749 and J1833-1034. For these pulsars the electromagnetic

msfor all pulsars. As seen in Table 5, we ﬁnd acceptable values
for the parameter 𝑠, since all results are less than the allowable
limit that is the radius of the star (12 km). The smallest value for
displacement appears to correspond to the star J0205+6449 and is

probability densities for the distance 𝑠and the initial spin period

assumption that the current spatial velocity of this population, is
solelyduetotherocketeﬀect,andwedonottakeintoconsideration
other kick mechanisms. Moreover we neglect the gravitational wave
emission for our population. For this statistical analysis we use the
emcee package (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013), which is a Python
implementationoftheaﬃne-invariantensemblesamplerforMCMC.
Here multiple walkers run in parallel but allowed to interact in such
a way that they can adapt their proposal densities.
The emcee package is an algorithm that performs equally well
under all linear transformations, so it is insensitive to covariances
amongparameters.Thefreeparametersforthisanalysisaretheinitial

Fortheformer,theacceptedvaluesareintherangeof[0,0.5]s,since
we believe that this mechanism appears only in pulsars with fast

use an optimizer to minimize the initial values that are needed for
theMCMCanalysis.Thisalgorithmwillﬁnallygiveustheposterior

with great accuracy, we do not set them as free parameters.
Finally, the emcee package, returns the posterior probabilities.

to the values of Table 5, it seems that a large distance could be
acceptable,sinceforsomepulsars,suchasJ1833-1034,J0537-6910
and J1809-1917, the distance 𝑠is larger than 8 km. Moreover, the

the magnetic ﬁeld of this pulsar, so that their simulated light curves
forthispulsarsingammaandX-rays,wouldagreewiththeonesthat
NICERhadprovided,justifyingthegeometryofthehotspots.Inthis
study, it was conﬁrmed that the magnetic axis should be oﬀ-centred
and that the magnetic ﬁeld consists of dipole and quadrupole com-
ponents. This signiﬁcant result, conﬁrms the theory of multipolar
stellar magnetic ﬁelds, and gives as a reason to test the rocket eﬀect
mechanismontheJ0030+0451pulsar.Eventhough,thisneutronstar
isnotassociatedwithanSNR,soitisnotayoungmagnetar,andhas
a small transverse velocity, it could still be a good candidate to test
therocketeﬀectmechanism,sinceitsoﬀsetmagneticdipoleﬁeldand
thefactthatithasaverysmallspinperiod,of4.87 ms(SeeTable6).
In their study Kalapotharakos et al. (2021), found diﬀerent oﬀset
morphologies for the magnetic ﬁeld, and many families of solutions
for static vacuum ﬁeld models and force free models. Speciﬁcally
they found that for some of these models the dipole and quadrupole

using equation 6. For this calculation, we considered that the initial
spin period is 2 ms, the distance 𝑠of the magnetic axis is 2.08
km, based on Kalapotharakos et al. (2021), and we integrated for a
period of time, equal to the characteristic age of the pulsar, which
is𝜏𝑐=758109yrs. Finally, we estimate that the kick velocity
shouldbe228 kms,iftherocketeﬀecthadacteduponthestar.This
velocity is much bigger than the current true transverse velocity of

and by using the values that appear in Table 6, we found that the
distance𝑠shouldbe3.02 km,andtheinitialspinperiod3.52 ms,for

pulsar.
Therefore, it is very likely that the rocket eﬀect mechanism has
no application in this pulsar. Even though it is a very fast rotating
pulsar, and it seems that its magnetic ﬁeld has oﬀset components,
we would expect that if a kick mechanism had been applied to this
neutron star, its space velocity would be bigger. We believe that
at some point a kick mechanism was applied on this pulsar, but
the results of this acceleration cannot be seen anymore. It is very
likely, that this isolated pulsar, had been through a spun up by a
companion at its ﬁrst years, via accretion of matter. This accretion
could lead to the increase of the pulsars angular momentum, ﬁnally
formingamillisecondpulsar.Moreoverthisaccretionofmasscould
be one of the reasons that led to this multipolar components of the
stellar magnetic ﬁeld, that we see through the NICER observations.
Assuming that the J0030+0451 pulsar had a similar magnetic ﬁeld
structureasitsprogenitor,whichcouldbedescribedbyadipoleﬁled,
itispossiblethataviolentaccretionalongwithafastspunup,could
have some eﬀect on the form of the magnetic ﬁeld. As proposed
by Chevalier (1989), young pulsars go through violent accretions of
mass coming from a companion star, which could bury the stellar
magnetic ﬁeld in the crust. So the fact that this pulsar is no longer
a magnetar could be explained by a buried magnetic ﬁeld, because
of the destruction of a near star or planet. Thus, the fact that this
millisecond has most likely undergone a spin-up phase, makes the
characteristic age irrelevant for this calculation.
Itshouldbementionedthatthismodel,aswellastheinitialmodel
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (XXX)The rocket eﬀect in neutron stars 9
of Harrison & Tademaru (1975), is for an oﬀset dipole magnetic
ﬁeld, and does not take into consideration higher multipole compo-
nents. The J0030+0451 is believed to have quadrupole and higher
components of the magnetic ﬁeld, so the expressions for the kick

of either the electromagnetic kick mechanism(Johnston et al. 2005)
or another kick mechanism (Janka et al. 2022) such as the neutrino-
driven kick mechanism, and gives the maximal values for the kick
velocity. Moreover, Xu et al. (2022) suggested that this alignment
could be due to the rocket eﬀect mechanism for this neutron star,
and calculated the expected kick, based on the model of Harrison &
Tademaru (1975). Considering an initial spin period of 1ms and a
distance𝑠of7kmtheyfoundthatthekickvelocityis400 kms,which
isveryclosetothecurrentvelocityofthispulsar(seeTable6).Onthe
otherhand,Jankaetal.(2022),proposedthattheobservedproperties
of J0538+2817 pulsar are not in favor of the rocket eﬀect, since it is
more likely that its initial spin period is bigger than 1 ms. Here, we
suggestthatthispulsarseemstobeagoodcandidatetotesttherocket
eﬀectmodel,sinceithasasmallspinperiod,andatransversevelocity
high enough, to assume that a kick mechanism have probably acted
upon the pulsar at some point in its life. Nonetheless, the magnetic
ﬁeld of J0538+2817, is not that strong while we expect the rocket
eﬀecttohaveabetterapplicationinmagnetars.Butitispossiblethat
this pulsar was a magnetar at its early life, and have experienced a
magnetic ﬁeld decay as time passed, due to accretion of mass. As
mentioned above, Chevalier (1989) argued that accretions of mass
coming from a companion star, buries the stellar magnetic ﬁeld in
the crust. So it is possible that the electromagnetic kick mechanism
hadactedonthepulsarwhileitwasnewbornandstillhadastronger
magnetic ﬁeld.
Even though this pulsar is in our catalogue depicted in Table 4,
we wanted to make a separate MCMC analysis for this case. As for
the analysis of our sample population, we considered an uniform
distributionforthedistance 𝑠andtheinitialspinperiod,withvalues
that are in the same range as our previous analysis. Our results can
be seen in Figure 5. In order to have similar values for the current
transverse velocity of the pulsar and the kick that is expected from
the rocket eﬀect mechanism, we estimate that the distance 𝑠should
be390¸142
 083kmand the initial spin period 195¸021
 015ms. Our result
for the distance 𝑠of the magnetic axis, has a declination from the
result in Table 5, where we found that the distance 𝑠should be 4.86
km, from the star’s center. This declination is completely due the
value of the initial spin period of the pulsar, since for the results in
table 5 we consider a strict value of 1 ms.Table6.CharacteristicquantitiesofthepulsarsJ0538+2817andJ0030+0451

According to our MCMC analysis, it seems that the initial spin
period should be very small, so that the rocket model has an impact
ontheneutronstar.Itshouldbementionedthat,Krameretal.(2003)
presented a timing proper-motion measurement for this pulsar and
estimated that its initial period should be 139 ms, a value which
comes with many constrains on the kick mechanisms that could be
applied to this pulsar Romani & Ng (2003), since it describes a
very slow rotating pulsar. We argue that this pulsar should have a
very small initial period, so that its large transverse velocity can be
justiﬁed. It is very likely that, after the spun up of the pulsar, due to
its electromagnetic and gravitational emission, follows a spin down.
In their work, Xu et al. (2022) proposed that the spin period of the
pulsar evolves proportionally with time, so we expect the pulsar to
slow down eventually.
4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have explored the impact of the rocket eﬀect to
observedpropertiesofneutronstars.Wehavefocusedonthreemain
aspects:therelationoftherocketeﬀecttopulsarbrakingindices,its
eﬀecttotheobservedspatialvelocitiesofpulsarsanditsapplication
to two speciﬁc cases for which we have strong indications that an
oﬀ-centre dipole magnetic ﬁeld or even multipolar ﬁeld is present.
An important issue is to understand what are the conditions that
leadtooﬀsetandmultipolarmagneticﬁeldconﬁgurations.Forexam-
ple Ruderman (1991) proposed that neutron superﬂuid vortex lines
thattraveltowardsthestar’scrust,canmodifythemagneticﬁeldcon-
ﬁgurationdependingonthestrengthandthespindownofthepulsar.
Moreoverinordertoexplainthemagneticﬁeldstructuresatthesur-
face of neutron stars, many studies have been focused on the Hall
drift eﬀect, which can be associated with a magnetic ﬁeld that has

multipolecomponents(Gourgouliatosetal.2018;Geppert&Viganò
2014). We note that axisymmetric models cannot have oﬀset ﬁelds,
however, in 3-D studies this is possible. Even if the exact details of
the mechanism are yet to be understood, the existence of multipolar
and oﬀset dipolar ﬁelds in J0030+0451, makes this scenario likely.
Regarding the impact of the rocket eﬀect to braking indices, we
foundnoclearindicationsthatitcanbeasigniﬁcanteﬀectforpulsars
whose braking indices deviate from the canonical values. This may
be due to the fact that the electromagnetic kick theory only consid-
ers the electromagnetic emission of stars, and has been developed
in the context of a vacuum magnetosphere for the star. Therefore,
while the rocket eﬀect predicts braking index values between 3 or
5, the actual values are in many cases considerably diﬀerent. If we
take into consideration the deceleration due to the emission of grav-
itational waves, the expressions 11, 12 would be very diﬀerent, and
maybe they would end up to more realistic values for the braking
indices. Also in this study, it is taken into account that the stellar
magnetosphere is vacuum, an assumption that greatly simpliﬁes our
calculations but it does not correspond to reality. So perhaps this
assumption contributes to the deviation of the results from the real
valuesofthebrakingindices.Moreover,itisimportanttounderstand
the diﬀerentmethodologies thathave beenused tocalculate theval-
ues of𝑛, that are shown in Table 3. These results arise from studies
that do not only consider dipole emission, but also other condi-
tions.Parthasarathyetal.(2020)haveresultsfor19pulsarsbasedon
Parkesradiotelescopeobservationscombinedwithaseriesoftimes
ofarrival(ToAs)simulations.AlsoJohnston&Galloway(1999)de-
veloped a method to calculate braking indices for intermediate-age
stars,withoutrequiringknowledgeof ¥𝑓(where𝑓istherotationfre-
quency of the star), while Gourgouliatos & Cumming (2015), tookinto account the quadrupole components of the magnetic ﬁeld that
appear due to the Hall eﬀect inside the star.
Weestimatedthekickvelocity becauseoftherocketeﬀectmech-
anism for 13 neutron stars, initially following the original theory
of Harrison & Tademaru (1975). We also calculated the kick by
developing an alternative model for the rocket eﬀect, in which we
included the time dependence of the force, and speciﬁcally the age
of the SNR and the spin-down of the star. In both cases the velocity
was determined for the case where the initial rotation period of the
star was 1 msand for the case where we calculate the initial period
fromequation3.Thehighestkickvelocitiesarefoundwhenweapply
the theory of Harrison and Tademaru, and consider that Pin=1𝑚𝑠.
For this case the velocity exceeded the 2000 kms.Our alternative
methodgivesmuchlowervelocities,whatevertheassumptionforthe
initialperiodofthestar.Sinceweworkedmostlyonpulsarsthatare
associated with SNRs, maybe this result indicates that perhaps the
rocket eﬀect theory should be applied to isolated neutron stars.

values, although in some cases it was quite large. For example, the
highestvalueforthedistancewas9.77 kmforthepulsarJ1809-1917,
which is quite extreme. However, in all cases the value of the dis-
placement is more than zero and less than 10 km, and considering
that we assumed a radius of 12 kmfor the neutron stars, the results
are optimistic.
Toquantifyourresults,werunaMarkovChainMonteCarloalgo-
rithmforourpopulationofpulsars,toﬁtourmodelwiththecurrent
values of the transverse velocity of each one. By considering the
sample, we found that parameters such as the distance of the mag-
neticaxisfromthecentreofthestarandtheinitialspinperiodshould
be𝑠=78 kmand𝑃𝑖𝑛=38 msfor the rocket eﬀect mechanism
to be completely responsible for the velocities we observe today in
pulsars. Those results seem reasonable, especially when it comes to
the initial spin period which is expected to be quite small.
In the following sections of this work, we stood on some case
studies which are in general considered good candidates to test the
rocketeﬀectmodel.InitiallywefocusedourstudyontheJ0030+0451
pulsar,whicheventhoughhasaveryfastrotationandisveriﬁedthat
its magnetic ﬁeld consists of multipolar components, seems to not
have been though a signiﬁcant kick, such as the electromagnetic
kick, since it has a slow transverse velocity that reaches up to 17
kms. For this pulsar we concluded that if the electromagnetic kick
had acted on it, its current velocity should exceed 200 kms. The
estimated values for the distance 𝑠an the initial spin period are
𝑠=302 kmand𝑃𝑖𝑛=352 msrespectively. The second case study
was the J0538+2817 pulsar. By running again an MCMC algorithm
for this neutron star, we found that the values of the distance of the
magneticaxisfromthestar’scenterandtheinitialspinperiodshould
be𝑠=291 kmand𝑃𝑖𝑛=177 msrespectively. That may be due
to the fact that, even though this pulsar has a slower rotating period
than J0030+0451 today, it has a stronger magnetic ﬁeld and much a
highertransversevelocity,whichcouldmeanthatakickmechanism
has probably acted on this pulsar.
It seems that the rocket eﬀect can describe some particular cases
of neutron stars, as long as they have very small initial spin periods
and relatively strong magnetic ﬁelds. A good indication that the
electromagnetic kick or any other kick have appeared on a pulsar
at some point, is its spatial velocity. A large value, thus we have a
fast pulsar, it is more likely that we have a good candidate to test
MNRAS 000, 1–13 (XXX)The rocket eﬀect in neutron stars 11
our kick mechanism. Also, the radial velocity is very important for
the study of kick mechanisms, and it can be estimated by using
the Doppler shift of the star’s spectral lines, that are going through
extreme broadening because of the large magnetic ﬁelds of neutron
stars.Sousuallyitishardtoknowapulsar’sradialvelocity.Another
important observation, is that in the analysis above, we do not take
into consideration the emission of gravitational waves, which are
factors that could change our results and give more precise and
realistic models, if applied. It is more likely that if the spin down of
thepulsarismostlybecauseofthegravitationalwaveemission,then
the rocket eﬀect mechanism should have a lesser impact. In their
study, Lai et al. (2001), found an expression for the kick because
of the rocket mechanism, including the spin down time due to the
electromagneticradiationandthegravitationalwaveradiationofthe
pulsar. They concluded that for the rocket eﬀect to be viable, the
timescales of both phenomena should be almost the same.
The presence of a plasma-ﬁlled magnetosphere may lead to dif-
ferent results compared to the vacuum electromagnetic ﬁeld we are
consideringinthiswork.Forinstance,acombinationofadipoleand
a quadrupole magneticﬁeld, whose axes cross the centreof the star,
leadstoanasymmetricnorth-southconﬁgurationwithrespecttothe
magnetic ﬁeld. In vacuum, both, the dipole and quadrupole term,
exert comparable torques (Pétri 2016) and, arguably, accelerations.
Thus, they could activate a rocket mechanism. On the contrary, if a
plasma-ﬁlledmagnetospheresurroundsthestar,spin-downisrelated
to the magnetic ﬂux crossing the light cylinder and this is mostly
duetothedipoleterm,providedthatthelightcylinderissuﬃciently
largerthanthestellarradius(Grallaetal.2016).Thus,whiletheﬁeld
is asymmetric on the surface, it is symmetric on the light cylinder.
Nevertheless, given that the rocket eﬀect is signiﬁcant for millisec-
ond pulsars, even in the case of a plasma-ﬁlled magnetosphere, the
magnetic ﬂux crossing the light cylinder will depend both on the
dipole and quadrupole terms and even in this case the rocket eﬀect
may operate. Given these complications, a detailed study of such
systems is required to resolve these eﬀects.
Additionally, one very important issue, as discussed above, is the
determination of the initial spin period of pulsars. If we make a
better estimation of the initial spin period of neutron stars, we will
have more accurate and realistic results. Here we make a series of
tests to ﬁnd the best conditions for the rocket eﬀect to be realistic.
First,wereliedontheworkofIgoshevetal.(2022)becauseinitially
in this work, we studied pulsars that are associated with SNRs. For
this case, if the characteristic age is greater than the age of the
SNR we assume that the initial rotation period is as low as 2 ms.

scenariowhichendsuptogreaterkickvelocities,isconsideringvery

Finally we made the MCMC analysis to get more realistic expected
values for the initial spin period for our population of pulsars.
Finally, in this study, we made the assumption that the current
transverse velocity is attributed entirely to only one kick mecha-
nism.However,itismorelikelythatmorethanonekick-mechanisms

APPENDIX A: MULTIPOLAR EXPANSION OF THE
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
Let us consider a neutron star with a displaced magnetic axis from
the star’s center, that we symbolise as 𝑠. Let us expand this oﬀset
dipoleﬁledinmultipoles.Weassumethattheneutronstarisrotating
invacuum,thus,electricchargesandcurrentsarezeroatthemagne-

the following expression, e 𝑖𝑘𝑥 𝑖𝜔𝑡, with𝑘=𝑛𝑓𝜔𝑐where𝜔is
the angular frequency and 𝑐is the speed of light, and 𝑛𝑓indicates

Harrison & Tademaru (1975) focused on the case where 𝑘𝑟1
(wave zone or near zone) where the intensity of electromagnetic
ﬁelds decreases faster with distance compared to the radiation zone.
Keeping the terms with the most important contributions (n=1) and
taking into consideration the components of the magnetic dipole

with𝜇𝑧𝜇𝜌𝜇𝜙, the magnetic dipole components in cylindrical co-

derive to the ﬁnal expression for the net force due to emission of

𝐹=8𝜔5𝜇2𝑧𝑠

We should also take into consideration the asymmetric factor 𝑒=

04¹𝜔𝑠𝑐º.Moreoverassuming
that the star does not emit gravitational but only electromagnetic
radiation then the spin-down luminosity 𝐿= 𝑒𝐼𝜔¤𝜔, where𝐼is
the moment of inertia of the neutron star. The kick velocity can
be found by combining Newton’s second law and the fact that the
electromagnetic force is equal to 𝐹=𝐿𝑒𝑐:
𝐹=𝑀𝑑𝑢
𝑑𝑡= 𝑒𝐼𝜔¤𝜔

Then the ﬁnal expression that Harrison and Tademaru arrived to
is equation 1 as modiﬁed by (Lai et al. 2001). In equation 1 if we
consider an initial spin period of 𝑃𝑖𝑛=1 msand a distance 𝑠=10
kmfor the magnetic axis from the star’s center, we expect a kick
velocity that can exceed 500 kms(Lai et al. 2001; Xu et al. 2021).
We note the above expressions for the total spin-down luminosity,
forceandthereforethevelocityofthekickcanbeevaluatedfollowing
a diﬀerent process. Alternatively, by integrating the Poynting ﬂow
per solid angle unit, and taking into account the retarded Lienard-
Wiechert potential, we can ﬁnd the corresponding equations that
interest us.
By observing equation 1, it is obvious that the initial spin period
of the pulsar is an important parameter for the rocket eﬀect model
anditsvaluecanaﬀecttheﬁnalresultofthekickvelocity.Thefaster
a pulsar rotates, the more likely it is for the rocket kick to appear.
In the following sections a discussion about initial spin periods of
pulsar is being made.
