Abstract
The extreme temperatures and densities of many astrophysical environments tend
to destabilize nuclear isomers by inducing transitions to higher energy states
which may then cascade to ground. However, not all environments destabilize
all isomers. Nuclear isomers which retain their metastable character in perti-
nent astrophysical environments are known as astrophysically metastable nuclear
isomers, or “astromers”. Astromers can influence nucleosynthesis, altering abun-
dances or even creating new pathways that would otherwise be inaccessible.
Astromers may also release energy faster or slower relative to their associated
ground state, acting as heating accelerants or batteries, respectively. In stable
isotopes, they may even simply remain populated after a cataclysmic event and
emit observable x- or γ-rays. The variety of behaviors of these nuclear species
and the effects they can have merit careful consideration in nearly every possible
astrophysical environment. Here we provide a brief overview of astromers past
and present, and we outline future work that will help to illuminate their role in
the cosmos.

Nuclides in astrophysics are connected in networks by creation and destruction mech-
anisms (transmutations) including proton [1–3] and neutron capture [4–8], βdecay
and its variants [9–11], αcapture [12–15], fission [16–18], and so on. Astrophysical
nucleosynthesis—the collective processes and environments in which the elements of
the universe are made—depends sensitively on transmutation rates, which in turn
depend on both the surrounding thermodynamic conditions and the properties of
nuclei.
Where sufficient information (experimental data and/or theoretical estimates)
about the excited states of an isotope of interest is available, analyses generally use a
Boltzmann distribution of energy levels to incorporate the thermal average ⟨P⟩of a
key physical property P, e.g. the β-decay rate [19–26]; note that Pfor an individual
state may also depend on the environment.

Where neither data nor theory provide adequate excited state information, the
ground state properties are typically taken as a stand-in [27]. In relatively low-
temperature scenarios where excited state populations are suppressed, this is typically
a useful approximation.
Nuclear isomers—excited states that live longer than the typical picoseconds or
femtoseconds—call into question the validity of either approach [28–30]. By way of
illustration, Figure 1 shows some essential characteristics and notional transmutations
of a nucleus with an isomer. In this nucleus, the isomer is the second excited state
(orange), and there is an assortment of higher-lying states before the continuum. The
first excited state is not an isomer.

addition to the spontaneous and stimulated downward transitions. Blue arrows delin-
eate typical fast transitions. Isomers exist because of quantum mechanical mismatches
between themselves and lower-lying states that hinder transitions [31]; the hindered
transitions are shown in red.
Finally, nuclear transmutations create (black dash-dot) and destroy (green dash)
the nuclear species; note that the ground state may also be destroyed, but this is
omitted from Figure 1 for clarity. This brings us to the question of how isomers

might influence nucleosynthesis. On the one hand, the hindered transitions slow ther-
mal equilibration, and transmutations could destroy the isomer faster than it can be
replenished. On the other hand, sufficiently high temperatures will populate higher
states that in turn rapidly populate the isomer, ensuring thermal equilibrium. Fur-
ther complicating the situation, transmutations that create the isotope might cascade
into or directly feed the isomer. The hindered transitions in this case would invalidate
the use of ground state properties. Unless, of course, it were hot enough to rapidly
drive the isomer to ground via higher states. This is the essence of the conundrum of
isomers in astrophysical nucleosynthesis.
2 History
This timeline is by no means complete, but it highlights several milestones in the study
of isomers in astrophysics.
The problem of nuclear isomers in astrophysical environments was first identified
and tackled by Solomon and Sargood [32] in 1978. They were examining a bottleneck
atA= 45 in silicon burning as nucleosynthesis flows from28Si to the iron group nuclei.
The key reaction45Sc(p, γ)46Ti presented a particular challenge. Not only will45Sc’s
lowest excited state (only 12.4 keV) have a high equilibrium population within the rel-
evant temperature range of 100-500 keV, but also that state is an isomer with a half-life
of 326 ms. Thus, the ( p, γ) cross section of that state must be included, and it is not
obvious if its in-situ population would be the thermal equilibrium value or if proton
captures would overwhelm internal transitions. With a computed mean lifetime against
proton capture of 1 ns, the question boiled down to how rapidly the ground state
and isomer populations—produced by42Ca(α, p)45Sc and45Ti(n, p)45Sc—converged
3to thermal equilibrium. By following the populations of all known45Sc states as they
transitioned amongst themselves, they found that the ensemble deviated from a Boltz-
mann distribution by less than 10% in no more than 140 ps, concluding that thermal
equilibrium was an adequate assumption in their application.
Building on this work, Ward and Fowler [33] developed an analytical formulation
for the ground state/isomer thermal equilibration timescale as a function of tempera-
ture in nuclei with 1-2 non-isomeric excited states, then extended it to more realistic
nuclei with many levels. Focusing on26Al, they compared the equilibration time to
nuclear transmutation rates in an assortment of astrophysical conditions where that
isotope can play a role. They found that in some situations,26Al would reach thermal
equilibrium, while in other environments, the destruction timescale was much shorter
than the thermalization timescale.
Using more complete data and large-scale nuclear shell model calculations to com-
pute essential unmeasured quantities (transition matrix elements and β-decay rates),
Coc et al. [34] tackled26Al and34Cl. In their approach, they performed a network
calculation where the “isotopes” were nuclear energy levels. From this, they computed
effective lifetimes of the ground state and isomer for each nuclide, which in practice is
the quantity required for nucleosynthesis simulations.
Gupta and Meyer [35] created a general treatment of isomers in astrophysics by
constructing particular ensembles of excited states. They demonstrated that non-
isomeric excited states rapidly achieve a Boltzmann-like equilibrium with the ground
state and isomer independently . This led to an interpretation of excited states as being
associated with ground or the isomer proportionally to the probability that it tran-
sitions to one or the other. The ensembles then consist of a single long-lived state
(ground state or isomer) and a modified Boltzmann distribution where each excited
state’s contribution in Eqn. 1 is further weighted by its association with that long-
lived state. With this construction, the ground state and isomer are treatable as truly
distinct species that undergo their own transmutations and transitions between one
another. Gupta and Meyer [35] also conceptualized the nuclear levels and transitions
as a directed graph and used Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding shortest paths [36] to
identify key internal transitions.
Recently, Misch et al. [37] found a precise formulation for computing thermally
mediated ground state ↔isomer transitions via intermediate excited states that min-
imizes physical assumptions. In that approach, transition probabilities between all
nuclear levels enable the calculation of effective transition rates between the long-lived
states with a single matrix inversion; no assumptions about excited state populations
are required. By defining an effective transition as any chain of transitions that starts
in one long-lived state and ends in another, they were able to generalize to nuclides
with multiple isomers. As with Gupta and Meyer [35], the rates can then be tabulated
as functions of temperature, and each of possibly multiple isomers may be treated as
separate species from the ground state in nucleosynthesis calculations.
The preceding history focused on the development of techniques, initiated by
Solomon and Sargood’s [32] needs for nucleosynthesis studies around A≈45. But
naturally, that development would not have continued if isomers didn’t seem to be
important elsewhere, as implied by the fact that many of the cited works spotlighted
426Al. Indeed, many efforts were driven in large part by26Al’s importance in meteoric
isotopic abundances [38] and γ-ray astronomy [39]. Over the years, other isomers have
drawn scrutiny from the nuclear astrophysics community.
Beyond the techniques for quantifying the behavior of isomeric species, other
research into isomers in astrophysics includes theoretical [40–42] and experimental
[43–46] nuclear inputs. Software tools for computing in-situ rates have been con-
structed [37, 47, 48], and isomers have been included in nucleosynthesis codes [49, 50].
The breadth of nucleosynthesis environments under examination for isomer effects
has grown, and with it, the isomers under investigation [9, 42, 51–54]. Now, highly
developed methods, modern nucleosynthesis codes, and ever-improving experimental
capabilities have converged with expanding recognition of the importance of isomers
over the last several years to inspire a burst of interest in this burgeoning field [55, 56].
3 What makes an isomer an astromer?
Simply put, an astromer is a nuclear isomer that retains its metastable character in an
astrophysical environment. High temperatures and high densities tend to drive internal
transitions both up and down between nuclear levels, pushing the ensemble of states to
an equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. However, an isomer, by definition, is at least
partially isolated by inherently slow transitions. Sufficiently strong thermal effects
can overcome this isolation, and the interplay of metastability and the surrounding
environment sets the isomer’s behavior.
“Metastable character” in this context means that the excited state resists internal
transitions to such an extent that the ensemble is far from a Boltzmann distribution for
sufficiently long that the nuclear species exhibits non-thermal-equilibrium behavior.
If an isomer undergoes nuclear transmutation more rapidly than internal transitions,
thermal equilibrium may not be attainable. Or perhaps a thermal population of an
excited state “freezes out” as an astrophysical event cools (the transition rates become
so slow that a non-thermal distribution remains as the temperature drops). In these
situations, the nucleus may not be treatable only with ground state properties, nor
may properties derived from a thermal Boltzmann distribution be safely assumed. The
ground state and isomer must be considered as separate species; this makes an isomer
an astromer.
Figure 2 shows a schematic “astromer diagram” that illustrates astromer behavior.
The solid lines indicate ground state ↔isomer transitions, and broken lines show
transmutation rates. Red lines have ground ( gs) as the initial state, and green lines
have the isomer ( m) as the parent. The blue line is the nuclide’s transmutation rate if
the states are in thermal equilibrium (if the isomer acts like a normal excited state),
and the black line shows the transmutation rate when ground and the isomer are
in a steady state equilibrium in which the population ratios are unchanging. In this
example, the isomer is less stable (has a faster transmutation rate) than ground.
The key feature to observe is that there is a temperature regime where the thermal
equilibrium and steady state rates do not overlap. Thermalization, because it is driven
by internal transitions, occurs when the transition rate out of each state dominates
its transmutation rate, that is, when the process that effects thermal equilibrium runs

The fact that this isomer can be an astromer is evidenced by comparing the thermal equilibrium
(blue dotted) and steady state (black dash-dot with crosses) transmutation rates: below the thermal-
ization temperature associated with the transmutation t(vertical line), the isotope clearly does not
transmute as though it were in thermal equilibrium, and the isomer is an astromer. Additional reac-
tion channels or decays further complicate this simple picture by introducing more contributions to
the transmutation rates. See text for details.
faster than processes that would disrupt it. In Fig. 2, for example, observe that where
the isomer transition rate (green solid) exceeds the isomer transmutation rate (green
dashed), the thermal equilibrium and steady state transmutation rates converge. This
defines the thermalization temperature (highlighted by the vertical line), above which
thermal equilibrium may be safely assumed. But below, transmutations disrupt the
Boltzmann distribution faster than internal transitions restore it, and thermal equilib-
rium does not hold. The isomer is then an astromer, and it must be treated separately
from ground.
Note that Figure 2 has been simplified to be pedagogical. First of all, it shows
only a single isomer, though an isotope can have two or more isomers. Second, in
astrophysical environments, there are often many transmutation processes that are
active at different temperatures, densities, and material compositions. The sum of
their rates in a particular situation defines an isotope’s thermalization temperature,
not necessarily a single rate, and each transmutation channel is usually quite sensi-
tive to the environment. Therefore, assessing an isomer’s astromeric nature demands
careful consideration of environmental effects on transmutation rates, as there can
exist a hierarchy of temperatures where a nucleus and its long-lived states may fail to
thermalize.
Isomers can occur in stable nuclei, and it is even possible for isomers to be more
stable than their corresponding ground states. Fig. 3 shows examples in the left and
right panels, respectively. The latter case is similar to Fig. 2, but with the ground and
isomer transmutation rates reversed. When this happens, it is possible to have more
than the expected population in the isomer, because the ground state is destroyed
6faster. Isomers in stable nuclei may persist after explosive nucleosynthesis has con-
cluded. Although there is no well defined thermalization temperature, the transition
rates slow as the environment cools, and the isomer populations will “freeze” in place
out of thermal equilibrium. As these astromers relax to the ground state, the nucleus
will emit x- or γ-rays. With this variety of behaviors, in some astrophysical envi-
ronments astromers will change nucleosynthetic pathways, in others they will affect
energy release, and in still others they may give an observable electromagnetic signal.

Fig. 3 Schematic astromer diagrams of a) a stable isotope with an isomer and b) an isotope in
which the isomer is more stable against transmutations than the ground state. In both cases, when
the surroundings are sufficiently cool, an outsize proportion of the nuclei can persist in the isomer,
which is then an astromer.
The final component of understanding what makes an isomer an astromer is a
detailed study of the role of non-isomeric excited states. Nuclear states may be mod-
eled as a directed graph in which the vertices (nodes) are the states, and the edges are
transitions [35, 37, 57]. When the edges are weighted by the transition rates, pathfind-
ing algorithms can rank which chains of intermediate states and associated transitions
(paths) most contribute to the effective ground ↔isomer transition rates.
Figure 4 highlights the top three paths in a hypothetical nucleus; in general, which
paths are most efficient is a function of the environment. On the vertical axis, the level
numbers are in increasing order of state energy. The number of steps along the path
from the ground state (Level 1) to the isomer (Level 2) is shown on the horizontal axis.
The path with the overall fastest transitions between the ground state and the isomer
is three steps in length (dashed red). Paths ranked two (solid black) and three (dash-
dotted pink) take four steps each. Fig. 4 shows paths from ground to the isomer, but
the most efficient paths from the isomer to ground are the same traveled in reverse
[37].
Path efficiency is not set by the number of steps, however, and a longer path can
often be more efficient than a shorter one. Notice the inflection points in the transition
rate curves in Figs. 2 and 3. Those are hallmarks of a new path becoming thermally
accessible. In the case of Fig. 2 (on which Fig. 4 is based), the 1 →3→2 path

dominates at lower temperatures but is overtaken by the 1 →3→4→2 path at
higher temperatures. This is because the 4 →2 transition naturally outpaces the
3→2 transition; once 4 can be adequately fed by thermal transitions, it contributes
to a faster path.
Pathfinding makes clear which nuclear data must be improved in order accurately
compute the rates, whether an excited state’s energy or a missing transition rate that
had to be estimated. This technique facilitates targeted experiments and theoretical
investigation for accurate modeling of influential astromers.
4 Isomers in the cosmos
A variety of thermodynamic conditions abound in the cosmos from slow nuclear burn-
ing taking place in the interior of stars to explosive environments like compact object
mergers where the astrophysical rapid neutron capture ( rprocess) is thought to take
place. Each of these events has temperature and density evolution that characterize
the environment, bringing about various behaviors of nuclear isomers. Isomer studies
have frequently been performed for stable or near-stable nuclei because this is where
the most nuclear data is available. More recently, studies have pushed towards under-
standing the behavior of nuclei farther from stability. In this section, we summarize
the present work regarding research into isomers in astrophysical environments.
8The most well known astromer is the 228 keV state in26Al, which is synthesized
inside relatively massive stars.26Al was the first radioisotope to be observed in cos-
mos [39, 58, 59]. The ground state decays with a half-life of ∼700 kyr and emits a
characteristic 1809 keV γ-ray, so this nucleus can serve as a tracer of star formation in
the galaxy [60–62]. In contrast, the isomer half-life is only ∼6 s [63]. Considering only
β-decay, the thermalization temperature is around 35 keV. Below this temperature,
the isomer decays faster than thermally moderated internal transitions can achieve a
Boltzmann distribution, causing this state to become an astromer. The importance
of26Al is widely known, and research continues on its production and destruction
[64–67].
The slow neutron capture process ( sprocess) produces roughly half the heavy
elements above iron on the periodic table; see Refs. [68, 69] for recent reviews. The
weak component (up to mass number, A∼90) is thought to occur in the helium shell
of massive stars, and the main sprocess is thought to occur in asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars [70]. S-process studies have traditionally assumed a thermal population
of isomers, which even then alter reaction rates [71]. In certain cases, more detailed
treatments are warranted, with nonthermalized effects considered by Kappeler et al.
[72].
An interesting s-process case arises with the nucleus85Kr. Because of its short
half-life of 4.5 hours (as compared to the months to years timescales of s-process nucle-
osynthesis), the 304.8 keV state in85Kr acts as important astromer and branch point
[73, 74]. When85Kr is populated below its β-decay thermalization temperature, the
isomer has an 80% β-decay branch, creating85Rb. In contrast, the ground state has a
half-life of nearly 11 years, giving ample opportunity to capture a neutron to become
stable86Kr, which can then capture another neutron and undergo subsequent βdecay
to87Rb. Consequently, the branch point at85Kr in the sprocess greatly impacts the
87Rb cosmochronometer [75] (a cosmochronometer is a nucleus which serves to deter-
mine the age of an astrophysical event). Interestingly, the main sprocess environment
oscillates between temperatures below and above the thermalization temperature, so
the nucleus oscillates between astromeric and thermal behavior [76]. Recent measure-
ments have improved the87Rb decay constant, indicating previous age estimates of
stars or samples in geochemistry to be 2% too young [77]. This development merits
further study of85Kr nucleosynthesis, particularly with respect to the astromer.
Other isomers also influence the sprocess. The observed presence of99Tc on the
surface of red giant stars suggests the isomer plays a significant role in reducing the
thermal β-decay rate of the nucleus [78, 79]. Shell model calculation for the β-decay of
this nucleus later confirmed this behavior [80]. The branch point148Pm also contains
an isomer that affects its β-decay rate [81, 82]. The importance of tin and indium iso-
topes was studied in the late 1980s [83]. The nucleus113Cd and its isomer at 263.5 keV
is another branch point in the s-process and is influential to the production of Sn iso-
topes [84]. The short-lived K-isomer [85] at 123 keV in176Lu serves as a thermometer
fors-process nucleosynthesis [86]; precise astrophysical lifetime measurements are crit-
ical for accurate modeling of this thermometer and its function as a cosmochronometer
[87–89].
9Thesprocess is believed to end with a cycle in which210Biβdecays to210Po,
which in turn αdecays to206Pb. An alternative ending occurs if the 3-million-year
210Bi isomer is populated and is an astromer. Instead of the ground-state βdecay to
210Po, the isomeric state would capture a neutron, then αdecay to207Tl. However,
studies of the impact of this isomer suggest thermal effects wash out any influence it
may have on the end of the s-process, so treatment as a single species seems to be
sufficient [90].
As the timescale for nucleosynthesis processes become faster, there’s the potential
to populate more nuclei and more isomers farther from stability. Data is less complete
for short-lived nuclei, and thus there are more uncertainties associated with these
isomer studies.
The rapid proton capture process ( rpprocess) occurs in explosive hydrogen burning
in type I x-ray bursts [91]. There are many isomers in the neutron-deficient rpprocess
path [92–94]. The temperature can range between 0.1 and 10 GK ( ∼8-1000 keV), so
isomers will certainly be populated [95, 96] and should be evaluated for their astromer
properties. The92Nb cosmochronometer has been found not to be impacted by its
isomer [97], and96Ru is unlikely to be produced in rpprocess [98]. However, other
isomers such as24Al and38K can create branch points, and studies of them are ongoing.
Numerous experimental efforts have provided essential data for these studies.24Al
isomer production has been constrained [99], although further information on an
excited state in25Si is needed to evaluate the24Al(p, γ)25Si reaction rate. The38K
isomer influences the bottleneck38K(p,γ)39Ca reaction, and techniques have been
developed for reliably producing and characterizing it [45].96Ag has been found to
contain multiple isomers that could be astromers [100], although their energies remain
unknown. Penning trap mass spectrometry and other methods have been used to
measure isomer energies [101] and to distinguish between ground and excited states rel-
evant for rp-process nuclei [102–104]. Isomer data—including half-lives, γ-ray energy,
and even new isomers—has been collected in the100Sn region [105–107].
Rapid neutron capture process ( rprocess) nucleosynthesis also involves explosive
astrophysical conditions in which the temperature and density evolve swiftly [108].
Although isomers have been identified as being important in the rprocess [109], they
have only recently been included in simulations.
Fujimoto and Hashimoto [52] were the first to study r-process isomers. In their
work they assumed direct population from the β-decay parents of select tin, antimony,
and tellurium isomers, which might have a substantial impact on kilonova light curves
due to the large difference in β-decay half-lives between the isomeric and ground states.
These elements are among the most populated in an r-process event, residing in the
second abundance peak (mass number A= 130), and hence have an outsize impact
on observables.
The first work to show the dynamic (not pre-assumed) population of nuclear iso-
mers in the rprocess was Ref. [53]. Misch et al. [53] showed that not only are nuclear
isomers populated during the decay back to stability (after neutron capture has mostly
run its course), but also a substantial number of those isomers are in fact astromers.
Different isomer behaviors were identified, including some that act as batteries (which
store energy, releasing it at later times relative to the ground state population), some
10accelerants (which speed up energy release relative to the ground state), and some
which do not strongly affect energy release, but might give an observable signal in the
r-process remnant.
This study used data from the latest ENDF and ENSDF libraries to explore known
isomers. Influential nuclei with missing data in these evaluations were isolated. For
example, the first excited state in128Sb was proposed to be an important accelerant
astromer, but its energy was not well measured and its level structure information
was sparse. In this case, the missing data prevented proper determination of the ther-
malization temperature. Hoff et al. [110] recently measured the first excited state of
128Sb and found it to be 43.9 keV, which is significantly higher than a previous esti-
mate. This measurement and the companion theoretical work enabled evaluation of
the thermalization temperature, estimated to be between 1 and 9 keV. This is much
higher than the temperature of the rprocess during its production, and this nucleus
is therefore always an astromer in the rprocess. This work underlines the synergistic
combination of theoretical and experimental effort required for the study of astromers.
A natural next step for both theoretical and experimental astromer efforts for the r
process will be to focus on nuclei in the N= 126 region due to the large abundances
of those nuclei coupled with expected rampant isomerism.
Using pathfinding between known energy levels in neutron-rich nuclei (see the
discussion surrounding Fig. 4), Misch et al. [54] estimated the sensitivity of isomer
behavior to individual nuclear transitions. For a wide swath of neutron-rich isomers
that could be produced in the rprocess, they computed ranges of transition rates
and thermalization temperatures. The ranges came from varying the rates of unmea-
sured internal transitions. Their pathfinding algorithm identified which unmeasured
transitions most affected thermalization temperatures.
One of the profound remaining mysteries regarding isomeric state production in
the cosmos is the case of180Ta [111]. The metastable state of this isotope (77.2 keV)
has a half-life of greater than 1015yr, while the ground state decays in 8 hr. Therefore,
the isomer prevents180Ta from decaying away after its production, affording it the
opportunity to survive to be the rarest primordial isotope on Earth. The production
site of180Ta remains unclear [112–116].
5 Future work
Computational developments in combination with the prevalence of modern experi-
mental facilities capable of producing a range of atomic nuclei make the time ripe for
studying nuclear isomers in astrophysics. Here we list at a high level ideas for future
research directions.
The prediction of isomeric states in short-lived nuclei is essential. Predictions serve
as a road map for experimental studies and supplement nucleosynthesis calculations
where data is lacking. The nuclear shell model’s ability to make detailed calculations of
excited state properties (e.g. energy, spin, transition/decay matrix elements) makes it
an ideal tool for computing the relevant nuclear structure, including not only predicting
the existence of isomers, but also in calculating transition and transmutation rates.
Spherical shell model codes such as NuShellX [117] and BIGSTICK [118, 119] are
11effective for nuclei that are not heavily deformed. In regions of the chart of nuclides
with many deformed nuclei, a projected shell model works well [120–123]. Because
shell models compute both level structure and rates, they provide a self-consistent
picture of excited states in nucleosynthetic environments.
Isomer measurements have expanded in recent years [124–131], including isolating
rapidly decaying states, spectroscopy analysis, and mass measurements. Isomers have
even been accessed via laser excitation [132–134]. More and more short-lived nuclei
are becoming accessible at radioactive beam facilities [135], but even short-lived nuclei
have been found to have relevant isomeric states [136]. Pure isomeric beams offer a
coherent picture of excited states allowing for in-beam γspectroscopy [137–140]. Dis-
tinguishing ground and isomeric states is also indispensable; new mass measurements
using MR-TOF allows for precision measurements that discriminate between ground
state and isomeric state [141].
The direct population and transmutation of isomers in nuclear reactions is also
a fruitful area of research. While relatively unexplored, neutron capture creating
isomers can substantially impact s-process nucleosynthesis [142]. Isomer effects on
proton capture in the rpprocess and neutron capture in the rprocess both remain
uncharted. In26Al and others, determining the cross sections on excited states helps to
reduce nucleosynthesis uncertainties [143]. Additionally, fission may populate different
excited states in the daughter fragments than βdecay does; the impact on r-process
nucleosynthesis has not been investigated.
Theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of ever more exotic nuclei
enable their evaluation. The release of evaluations in consistently updated databases
is essential for accelerating the pace of scientific discovery in astrophysics. Databases
that come equipped with code-based interfaces or easy-to-parse file formats reduce
the need for one-off scripts in research. The release of the atlas for nuclear isomers
represents a step in this direction [144, 145].
It is instructive to analyze the current status of data (and lack their of) affecting
isomers. Uncertain nuclear data which affects known isomers is shown in Figure 5 and
tabulated in the appendix (Table A1). Isomers with unknown energies are highlighted
in red. Penning trap mass measurements can differentiate these states from the ground
state. Green indicates neutron-rich nuclides with missing transition rates between
energy levels isolated from Misch et al. [54]; that study covers a small subset of all
possibly important unknown transition rates in atomic nuclei. Missing and incomplete
data on branching ratios associated with the non-electromagnetic decay of nuclear
levels are shown in blue; this data is important to determine the feeding of the isomer
versus the ground state. For many nuclei, multiple properties will be required, as
indicated by purple shading;195Pt for the understanding of the r-process is one such
case [53].
It is important to realize that Fig. 5 was created using readily available information,
and it is probably far from complete. Deeper investigation of known isomers and the
discovery of new ones would color more squares on the chart.

include level energies (Mass), transition rates (Gamma), and branching ratios (Decay). The light gray

6 Concluding remarks
Nuclear isomers and their impact in astrophysics have long been recognized. Yet, the
study of astromers is in its infancy. In addition to the inclusion of isomers in astro-
physical simulations with increased fidelity, continued investment in high-precision
experiments on both relatively stable and short-lived nuclei is crucial for the vital-
ity of the field. Continued development of theoretical nuclear structure models that
are capable of predicting isomerism in unexplored regions are requisite for guiding
experimental campaigns as well as for estimating relevant quantities when data is
unavailable. Compiling experimental and theoretical information into evaluated data
suitable for rapid dissemination and application in astrophysics is imperative. Con-
necting astrophysics, nuclear structure, and reactions will lead to new insights in the
future [146], and astromers will play an important role.

Appendix A Known missing data
Many isotopes with isomers are known to have incomplete data. Table A1 summarizes
missing data for nuclear isomers , not necessarily astromers ; this information underlies
Fig. 5. Before one can determine whether the particular state acts as an astromer, a
substantial amount of data is required. Determining whether an astromer meaningfully
affects its host isotope’s behavior requires even more. This table should serve as a
starting point for exploration.
Table A1 : Experimental data known to be missing. An “X”
denotes that the data in the corresponding category is incomplete
for that isotope. “Mass” refers to the isomer energy. “ γ” is impor-
tant γtransition rates identified in Misch et al. [54] (that work
only examined neutron-rich isotopes of interest in the rprocess),
and “Branching” means that decay feeding from a parent nucleus
is incomplete. The “Started” column indicates whether experimen-
tal work is known by the authors to have been initiated.
