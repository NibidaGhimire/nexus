In recent years, driven precisely by the investment of these typ es of technology companies, a
set of artiﬁcial intelligence-based tools has been developed . Its application and use have become
popular due to its performance.One aspect that characterizes them, besides the speed,eﬃciency,

impartiality comes from considering that their verdicts are t he result of operating with objective

One of the latest online applications that has attracted the most media attention is being car-

its study a necessity and impels us to take an interdisciplinary p erspective capable of addressing
the diﬀerent dimensions that characterizeit.
Thus, the objective of our research is to examine the positions that ChatGPT reﬂects on issues

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 LargeLanguageModels
Large Language Models (LLMs) are machine learning models that ar e designed to represent the
likelihood of word sequences in a given domain, such as essays, books, or documents. LLMs are
trained to capture statistical patterns in word sequences from a particular corpus, and can then
beused to predict theprobability ofgenerating thenext sequenc e ofwords. Thearchitectureand
training objectivesofan LLMmayvarydepending onitsintended use . Inthisdiscussion, we will
focusspeciﬁcallyonLLMsthat are tailored forlanguagegener ation.

and ﬁne-tuning.
Some of these methods, including ChatGPT,have been developed using a technique known as

erate responses based on known sources, rather than responses t hat merely seem plausible. This
approachmaybe useful in the future forimproving the reliabi lity ofLLM-generatedresponses.4 Castillo-EslavaF., MouganC.,Romero-Reche A.and StaabS.
2.2 SocialScience Foundations
Responsibleinnovation requiresaninterdisciplinary approach [Stilgoe et al.2013 ].Inordertoan-
ticipate, understand andmitigate thepossible risksposedbyne w technology,thereistheneedto
view its implications through diﬀerent lenses. In this work we p rovide a territorial construction

Obviously, this is particularly relevant when AI is used not ju st as a source of unstructured

With the continued advancement of generative models, including lang uage models (as shown in

the potential beneﬁts, risks, and negative eﬀects associated wi th these models. To address this,

their eﬀectiveness using both automatic and human evaluation m ethods. In our work, we do not
focuson mitigating toxicity but on evaluating our position on the topic of territorial recognition
in comparison toother agents.
[Kenton et al. 2021 ] highlight some ways behavioral issues of LLMs can arise fro m accidental
misspeciﬁcation bythe system designer. Our workis not necessa rily targetedto mispeciﬁcations,
but to highlight the diﬃculty of the task, which even among pol itics experts is not typically free
ofcontroversy [ Peter2017 ].
The authors of the paper titled "Process for Adapting Language Models to Society (PALMS)
with Values-Targeted Datasets" [ Solaimanand Dennison 2021 ] propose an iterative process that
aims to change the behavior of language models signiﬁcantly. Thi s process involves crafting and
ﬁne-tuning the language model on a dataset that reﬂects a predete rmined set of target values.
The authors demonstrate that it is feasible to adjust language model behavior signiﬁcantly with
a small, hand-curated dataset. In our work, we analyze how gener ative language modelscan pro-
vide knowledge about the recognition of territorial sovereig nty, which opens up the question of
whether it’s possible to tacklethe problem of LLM-humanali gnment even in cases when there is
nohuman consensusand howto react in these situations.
An example of the eﬀects of technology on territorial soverei gnty is Alphabet Inc.’s online
mapping service Google Maps, which has led to complaints from p olitical actors who felt dam-
aged by the company’s deﬁned border demarcation. The delimitat ion of the region that houses
the Palestinian-Israeli conﬂict or the territory of Arunachal P radesh claimed by China and India
are two examples of the diﬀerent controversies generated around the application [ Miranda 2016 ;
Quiquivix 2014 ].

Three territories were selected for analysis: Crimea,the We st Bank,and Transnistria. The ﬁrst
was chosen because it represents one of the most relevant territ orial conﬂicts of the last decade.
Thecase of theWest Bankwaschosenbecause ofthe historical d imension that hascharacterized
the conﬂict and the diﬃculties generated by the diplomatic rela tions that Israel maintains with a
large part of the international community. And Transnistria was add ed because of the repeated

4.1.2 Wikipedia. Theonlineencyclopediadescribesthesituation asaclearoccu pationbyRussia
andconsiderstheterritoryaregionofUkrainefromtheveryﬁrs tsentence:“Crimeaisapeninsula
in Ukraine, on the northern coast of the Black Sea, that has been occupied by Russia since 2014”.
Still in the introductory section, the website again speaks of Russian occupation, calls the refer-
endum and annexation illegal and informs the reader that most of the international community
recognizes Ukraine’s sovereignty over the territory: “In 2014 , the Russians occupied the penin-
sula and organized an illegal referendum in support of Russian a nnexation, but most countries
recognizeCrimeaasUkrainian territory”.Thisposition isre aﬃrmedandthesame argumentsare
restated in thehistory subsection under“ Russian occupation (2014-present) ” [Wikipedia 2023a ].
4.1.3 ChatGPT. FromChatGPT’sanswersadeclinationtowardstheUkrainianpar toftheconﬂict
is induced. In the second sentence of the ﬁrst question it already means considering the territory
part of Ukraine, although it warns of being controlled by Russia: “It is located in Eastern Europe
and ispart ofUkraine,althoughit iscurrently controlledbyRus sia”.
The answers to the next two questions (Q2 and Q3), retain practica lly the same content and
muchofthe same structure.In both,the modeladdsthat theanne xation hasnot beenrecognized
by most countries of the international community,states that it h asbeen widely condemnedas a
violation of international law, and refers to the resolutions in w hich the United Nations General
Assembly urges Russia to withdraw its forces from Crimea and t o respect the sovereignty and
territorial integrity ofUkraine.
Thediﬀerencebetweenthelattertwopartscomesfromthedegr eetowhichtheyratifyUkraine’s
sovereignty over Crimea. While the second question displays a more descriptive tone of the con-
ﬂict and describes the sovereignty of the territory as an objec t in international dispute - “the
sovereignty of Crimea is a matter of international dispute” -, th e third one leaves no room for
doubt asto whohassovereignty over thearea and turns tointernati onal law:
“ ‘According to international law, Ukraine has the right to sovere ignty over Crimea. Crimea is
anautonomousrepublicwithinUkraineandhasbeenrecognizedas suchbymostcountriesinthe
international community’”
Another aspect by which ChatGPT’s position on the conﬂict can b e perceived stems from the
total absence of any statement, argument or version that could le gitimize the action taken by
Russia.
4.2 WestBank
4.2.1 United Nations. For the territory comprising the Palestinian-Israeli conﬂict, the position
of the United Nations has been expressed through the issuance of a series of Security Council
resolutionsinfavorofPalestine:242(1967),338(1973),446 (1979),452(1979),465(1980),476(1980),
478 (1980),1397(2002),1515 (2003),1850(2008)and 2334(20 16).If we take as a reference the last
resolution [ UN/S/RES/2334 2016 ], although they all coincide in the sense of the ruling, we can
infer where the organization establishes the territorial lim its of the two States when it expresses
its concernabout the factthat the:
“ Continuing Israeli settlement activities are dangerously impe riling the viability of the two-
State solution based onthe 1967lines...”
The 1967 lines refer to the territorial demarcation establis hed in the Arab-Israeli armistice of
1949.This would come to be adopted as the reference limits wit h which to recognize Palestinian8 Castillo-EslavaF., MouganC.,Romero-Reche A.and StaabS.
territory after Israel exceeded them in the June 1967 war. In c onsideration of the 1967 lines, the
West Bankisconsidered part of thebordersof thePalestinian St ate.
Returning to the text, the UN condemnsany measures undertaken by Is rael “aimed at altering
the demographic composition, character and status of the Pale stinian Territory occupied since
1967” and refers to resolution 1515 (2003) to remind it of the ob ligation to halt “all settlement
activity,including’naturalgrowth’,andthedismantlementofal lsettlementoutpostserectedsince
March 2001”. Thus, the organization “reaﬃrms that the establ ishment by Israel of settlements in
the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East J erusalem, has no legal validity and
constitutes a ﬂagrantviolation under international law”.
4.2.2 Wikipedia. For the issue of the West Bank, Wikipedia again refers to the si tuation as an
occupation. In this case, it states that the territory is “unde r an Israeli military occupation since
1967”. Another description that conﬁrms this version comes wh en it refers to Israelis living in
the West Bank as settlers. To reinforce the position it conveys, the website adds as an argument
the illegality with which the international community considers Israeli settlements on the basis
of international law. In the same way, it uses a ruling of the Interna tional Court of Justice as an
endorsement.Apartfromtheintroduction,Wikipediaagaindeal swiththesubjectunderthesame
terms in the diﬀerent sections, such as in the history section a nd in the speciﬁc section called
“Consequencesofoccupation”[ Wikipedia 2023c ].
4.2.3 ChatGPT. On this occasion, there is not so much evidence to perceive a clea r positioning
of ChatGPT on the conﬂict. In fact, it is only discernible from th e use of one word in the ﬁrst
generalquestion.Speciﬁcallywhenitusestheterm“ occupied”whendescribingtheconﬁguration
of territory: “Cisjordan includes the modern state of Israel , as well as the West Bank and Gaza
Strip,whichareterritoriesoccupiedbyIsraelbutclaimed bythePalestinians”. Withthissentence
he delegitimizes Israel’s sovereignty over the territories in the West Bankand grants sovereignty
to Palestine.
On the other hand, the results obtained from the other two quest ions become an exercise in
contextualizing theconﬂict.Twoalmostidentical textsareext ractedin whichanattempt ismade
to reﬂectan impartial and merelydescriptive position ofthe conﬂict:
“The question of who has rights over Cisjordan, also known as Pa lestine or the Land
of Israel,isa complexand controversial issue with a longhisto ry”
“Some people believe that the western region of Cisjordan sh ould belong to the state
of Israel,while othersbelieve it should bean independent Pale stinian state.”
“There are diﬀerent viewpoints on this issue, and the resolutio n to the conﬂict will
dependonthewillingnessofthepartiesinvolvedtoﬁndamutually acceptablesolution
that takesinto accountthe rightsand interests ofall parties”
4.3 Transnistria
4.3.1 United Nations. The position of the United Nations on the status of Transnistria i s again
inducedfrom theset ofresolutions issued on the territory,bu t in thiscase by theGeneral Assem-
bly: 54/117(1999),55/179 (2000),56/216 (2001),57/298(2 003)[UN/A/RES/57/2982003 ] and 72/282
(2018)[UN/A/RES/72/2822018 ]. In the ﬁrst two, the existing references to the Transdniestria n is-
sue are aimed at supporting eﬀorts to resolve the conﬂict and to r eﬂect Russia’s commitment to
withdraw its forcesfrom the territory of the Republic of Mol dova. The two successor resolutions
tothosejustcitedretainthesamepurpose,butaddthatthep oliticalsettlementoftheconﬂictmust
be based on "full respect of the sovereignty and territorial int egrity of the Republic of Moldova".
Finally, the last pronouncement of the General Assembly is issued in order to urge “the RussianThe Role ofLarge LanguageModels in theRecognition of Terri torialSovereignty: AnAnalysisof the Constructionof

isconcernedthat “the continuousillegaljoint military exercis es oftheOperational Group ofRus-

4.3.3 ChatGPT. Finally, in the case of Transnistria, it was the only territory wh ere no evidence
was found in the language used by ChatGPTto draw a clear conclusi on about its position on the
conﬂict. As was seen in much of the West Bank example, the model’ s response oﬀers a contextu-
alization of the conﬂict with great care in the language so as not to be biased. Thus,the response
is limited to providing historical data and indicating the posit ion of the actors involved from a
neutral position:
“Transnistria declaredindependence fromMoldova in 1990,but it s independence has
not beenrecognizedby anycountry”
“The Moldovan government considers Transnistria to be an autonomo us territorial
unitwithinMoldova,whiletheTransnistrianauthoritiesconsi derthemselvestobean

5 DISCUSSION
The content analysis undertaken on the ChatGPT responses and compa rison against Wikipedia
and the United Nations resolutions has led to the identiﬁcation of a set of particularities that
have facilitatedthe taskofcharacterizingthebehavior dis played bythemodel.Themainissue to
highlightreferstoananalysisofthebiasedanswersofAIsyst ems.Aswehavebeenabletoverify,
theanswers oﬀer,in two ofthethreecases,evidence thatreﬂec tsa position in favorofoneofthe

it is lesscategoricalwith regardto the West Bank,it oﬀersa b iased response in favor ofPalestine
whenspeaking ofoccupationwith respect to theterritories c ontrolledbyIsrael in the region.10 Castillo-EslavaF.,MouganC.,Romero-Reche A. and StaabS.
The case of Transnistria is the only territory where no terms or ex pressions have been found
to induce the AI to take sides in the conﬂict. Taking into account th at part of ChatGPT’s source
of information is based on Web content,it is possible that the si gniﬁcantly lower media coverage
of the conﬂict has inﬂuenced the amount of information generated in this regard and, thus, the
neutrality of the model. On the other hand, the categorical exp ressions with which he addresses
the issue of the Crimean peninsula may be due to precisely the op posite:: one of the most impor-
tant international conﬂicts of the last decade and with the condemnat ion of the Russian annexa-
tionbymostoftheinternational community-asreﬂectedintheUN GeneralAssemblyresolution
68/262[UN/A/RES/68/2622014 ].
In relation to the Palestinian-Israeli issue, a possible expl anation for the less forcefulness with
which ChatGPT is signiﬁed and the descriptive nature of its resp onses can perhaps be found in
the high complexity of the conﬂict and in the actors involved. Al though the UN Security Coun-
cil has already pronounced itself warning of the illegality of th e Israeli settlements in the West
Bank [UN/S/RES/2334 2016 ]-with the abstention of the US-, the close relations that Isra el main-
tains with much of the international community might inﬂuence attenu ate the positions of its
partners. This could signiﬁcantly aﬀect the generation of the num ber of oﬃcial documents con-
demning Israel’s conduct. Just as the use of gender-ethnicity bas ed image ratios has been a topic
of controversy in the past [ BuolamwiniandGebru 2018 ], it prompts the question of what oﬃcial
document ratios should be used for international political conﬂi cts and, consequently,the source
ofdata fromwhichthe modellearnswould also bereduced.
Thus, the position of the two online resources has always taken the same position as the one
issuedbytheUN,exceptforthecaseofTransnistriainwhichCh atGPTtakesaneutralpositionon
the conﬂict.Thefactinduces to thinkthat the attitude ofthe int ernational communityinﬂuences
the position reﬂectedby ChatGPTand the content addedto Wikipe dia.
Another aspectworth highlighting is related to the eﬀectivene ss of the questions developed to
achievetheresearchobjective.Twotypesofquestionswerea ppliedtothemodel: (/u1D456)theﬁrst ofa
general nature about the territory and (/u1D456/u1D456)the other aimed directly at ﬁnding out who ChatGPT
considers has more rights over the disputed territory.; it wa s the ﬁrst one that best captured the
positioningofthemodel.Thismaybeduetothetrainingtowhicht heAIhasbeensubjectedtode-
tectquestionsthatexpectabiasedortendentiousanswerfromth emodel.Thus,themosteﬀective
strategy in our research to collect the behavior of ChatGPT h as been to ask general and indirect
questions about theissue to beevaluated, instead ofspeciﬁc a nd directeddirectly to decipherthe
position of the model. This way of skirting the impartiality w ith which the AI responds oﬀers
greater possibilities of reﬂectingan arbitrary behaviorin response to a question asked.
Finally, an issue perceived in the work and which has a bearing on the idea just expressed
has to do with the high similarity found between the answers to q uestions two and three. In
these questions, in addition to the content whose diﬀerence is mi nimal when dealing with the

6 CONCLUSION
The results and the analysis carried out throughout the study h ave led to a series of reﬂections
on the behavior identiﬁed in ChatGPT. The ﬁrst one is directed t o the behavior exhibited by the
modelwhenexpressingitselfonacontroversialtopic.Atthis juncture,artiﬁcialintelligenceLLMs
aspire to oﬀer a neutral response that doesnot lean towards any of the opposing parties. Despite
attempts to avoid bias, the results of the work have shown tha t in two of the three scenarios the

forboththe knowledgeacquisition processesand the case stud y selectedforthis research.
Algorithmicjudgment,asperformedbyChatGPTwhenquestione daboutterritorialsovereignty,
may avoid certain elements of humansubjectivity, but still i ncorporatesvalue judgmentsand po-
sitions that maybe intrinsic to the sourcesfrom whichit gather sinformation or even to the very
deﬁnition of conceptsand problems.Theemergenceof acomputati onal authority [Airoldi,2021],

ﬂicting positions to provide an unbiased review of the subject m atter, could entail the reinforce-
ment ofspeciﬁcpoints ofview, thusestablished asobjectiveb y anon-human,dispassionate (and,
therefore,more reliable) intelligence.
TotheextentthatLLMsarepopularizedtoamasspublicasaninf ormationsearchresource,their

to their use. In the case at hand,the potential implications are especiallysigniﬁcant because they
transcendtheindividuallevelandalsohaveaneﬀectonstatebor ders.Therecognitionofaterritory
to a political actor constitutes the legitimization of the one who issues it. With this in mind, the
perception of all users who make use of AI such as ChatGPT on th e sovereignty of a region will
be inﬂuenced by the positioning of the model’s responses with resp ect to the territory. Thus, the

technology companies whose orientation may be conditioned to the particular interests of the
companies.
In view of the above and the biased results that the model has oﬀ ered, it becomes necessary
to address the debate on the role that these new tools should pl ay in society and the position
that they should reﬂect in the face of the transcendental dilemm as described above. Opting for
neutrality by oﬀering a fair description of the conﬂict or repro ducing the position taken by the
international communityare twooptions thatare notfree ofrisksa ndcontroversies. Theissue is
extremely complex and multifaceted, and ongoing debates are need ed to understand the impact
and consequences of AI behavior on knowledge generation and territ orial legitimization. Thus,
