Abstract —Multi-target detection is one of the primary tasks
in radar-based localization and sensing, typically built on phased
array antennas. However, the bulky hardware in the phased array
restricts its potential for enhancing detection accuracy, since the
cost and power of the phased array can become unaffordable
as its physical aperture scales up to pursue higher beam
shaping capabilities. To resolve this issue, we propose a radar
system enabled by reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs), a
novel meta-surface antenna composed of meta-material elements
with cost-effective and power-efficient hardware, which performs
multi-target detection in an adaptive manner. Different from the
phase-control structure in the phased array, the RHS is able
to apply beamforming by controlling the radiation amplitudes
of its elements. Consequently, traditional beamforming schemes
designed for phased arrays cannot be directly applied to RHSs
due to this structural difference. To tackle this challenge, a wave-
form and amplitude optimization algorithm (WAOA) is designed
to jointly optimize the radar waveform and RHS amplitudes in
order to improve the detection accuracy. Simulation results reveal
that the proposed RHS-enabled radar increases the probability
of detection by 0.13 compared to phased array radars when six
iterations of adaptive detection are performed given the same
hardware cost.

I. I NTRODUCTION
High-accuracy localization and sensing are essential in
facilitating the advancement of indoor navigation in large
buildings, inventory management in factories, and other ap-
plications within the context of next-generation wireless sys-
tems [1], [2]. To fulfill this vision, radars are recognized as
a fundamental enabler, which conventionally rely on phased
arrays antennas. The phased array, comprised of an array
of antenna elements, empowers independent phase control of
the fed signal at each element through a phase shifter, thus
enabling electrically controlled beam steering for the sensing
of targets in different directions.
However, the intrinsic characteristics of the phased array
have limited its development in future high-demanding sens-
ing applications. Specifically, on the one hand, the antenna
gain that is positively correlated to the sensing accuracy is

On the other hand, in light of the use of costly and power-
consuming hardware components like phase shifters, scaling
up the physical aperture of the phased array leads to an
unaffordable increase in manufacturing expenses and power
consumption. Thus, there is a pressing need for novel antennas
with low cost and power consumption and corresponding
signal processing techniques.
Recently, the advancement of reconfigurable holographic
surfaces (RHSs) brings a promising solution to the above
issues [3]. The RHS is a type of meta-material antenna that
can form a desired beampattern by independently adjusting
the amplitude of the radiated signal at each element. Different
from the phase control in the phased array, the amplitude
control at each RHS element is realized by a simple diode-
based circuit, which is much more cost-effective and power-
efficient. Hence, the RHS can be a favorable candidate for
the next-generation radar antenna to support high-accuracy
localization and sensing.
Existing works have already explored the use of RHS in
radar sensing applications [4], [5]. In [4], a microwave camera
is synthesized using the RHS for imaging task, where the RHS
is designed to form a beam pattern towards a specific direction
at each time in order to scan the scene. In [5], an RHS-
enabled radar is developed for target detection by maximizing
the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the reflected signal at a
certain direction. However, these works only focus on the
RHS-aided detection of a single target at a time, research on
the simultaneous detection of multiple targets is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate multi-target detection enabled
by the RHSs, where two RHSs are closely deployed to serve
as transmit and receive antennas, respectively. By carefully
designing the amplitudes of the two RHSs, the proposed sys-
tem is able to simultaneously detect multiple targets with high
accuracy. However, this task is non-trivial due to the following
two reasons. First, due to the difference in hardware structure
between the RHSs and phased arrays, traditional beamforming
schemes designed for phased arrays with phase control cannot
be directly applied to RHSs with amplitude control. Second, it
is challenging to jointly optimize the radar waveform and RHS
amplitudes considering the coupling between them in terms ofarXiv:2401.09098v1  [eess.SP]  17 Jan 2024Tx Tx RHS Rx RHS

the detection performance.
To confront these challenges, we formulate a relative en-
tropy based optimization problem to jointly optimize the radar
waveform and the RHS amplitudes, and design a waveform
and amplitude optimization algorithm (WAOA) to solve this
problem. Simulation results are presented to verify the effec-
tiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, it is demon-
strated that the proposed RHS-enabled scheme can enhance
the detection performance for multiple targets compared to
traditional phased array based scheme.
II. S YSTEM MODEL
A. Scenario Description
Consider an RHS-enabled radar system for multi-target
detection as shown in Fig. 1. The system is composed of a
transmitter (Tx), a receiver (Rx), an RHS connected to the Tx
(Tx RHS), and another RHS connected to the Rx (Rx RHS).
The two RHSs are closely deployed, and the targets to be
detected are in the far-field of the radar system.
The aim of the proposed radar system is to detect all
the targets without the prior knowledge of their number and
locations. The detection process consists of multiple cycles,
and each cycle consists of the following three steps [6]:
•Optimization: The radar waveform and RHS amplitudes
are optimized based on the prior information obtained
from previous cycles. In the first cycle, these variables
are initialized randomly. The details of the optimization
problem will be presented in Section III and IV.
•Transmission and reception: The radar signals are trans-
mitted and received in this step, which will be discussed
in Subsections II-B and II-C.
•Determination: In this step, we update the estimation
of the target information by analyzing received signals.
The termination condition is then checked to determine
whether to end the detection process or move on to the
next cycle, which will be introduced in Subsection II-D.
B. Model of Reconfigurable Holographic Surfaces
The RHS is a special kind of leaky wave antenna composed
of feeds and an array of meta-material elements, as shown in
Fig. 1. The RHS operates through serial feeding. Specifically,
when the RHS serves as a transmit antenna, the radar signals
are injected via the feeds, and propagate along the RHS
elements to excite the elements one by one. When an elementis excited, the signal is radiated as leaky wave at this element.
And the amplitude of the radiated wave at each element can be
independently designed between [0,1]to steer radiation beam.
Consider a two-dimensional (2D) Tx RHS with Ltfeeds
andNtelements. The transmitted signal S(c)∈CNt×Itat the
c-th cycle can be formulated as
S(c)=Ψt(c)(Qt◦Γt)X(c), (1)
where X(c)∈CLt×Itdenotes the radar signal at the c-th cycle

Due to the reciprocity of antennas [5], the received signal

expressed as

C. Received Signal Model
Assume the target number in the interesting area is K,
which is unknown. And we assume that the multiple targets
are located in different angular grids and have the same range.
The reflected signal at the c-th cycle can be given by
V(c)=KX

respectively. W(c)∈CNr×Irdenotes the received noise,

zero mean and covariance matrix σ2IIr×Ir.

is the noise term.D. Detection Model
The proposed radar system performs multi-target detec-
tion by using multi-hypothesis testing. Specifically, we dis-
cretize the interesting area into Jangular grids, namely
{(θj, φj), j= 1,···, J}, and formulate a total number of
NHhypotheses H0,H1,···,HNH−1.H0represents the null
hypothesis. Hj(j̸= 0) can be described by v(Hj) =
v1(Hj),···, vI(Hj)(Hj)
, meaning that there are I(Hj)
targets and the i-th target is located in the vi(Hj)-th grid. In
each cycle of the detection process, we update the probabilities
of the hypotheses. The process ends when the probability
of a certain hypothesis exceeds a specific threshold while
probabilities of other hypotheses are below a lower limit. The
hypothesis with the highest probability is accepted as the final
detection result.
First, we define the prior probability of hypothesis Hjin
the first cycle as
p(1)(Hj) =1
(Km+ 1)NI(Hj), (5)
where Kmis the maximum number of potential targets, and
NI(Hj)is the number of hypotheses assuming I(Hj)targets
exist. Given the received signal y(c)at the c-th cycle, the prior
probability at the (c+ 1) -th cycle can be expressed as
p(c+1)(Hj) =p(c)(Hj)p(y(c)|Hj)P
ip(c)(Hi)p(y(c)|Hi). (6)
Denote the effective signal under hypothesis Hjat the
c-th cycle as u(c)
j=u(c)(I(Hj),x(c),ψt(c),ψr(c)). The

III. P ROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Problem Formulation
We aim to improve detection accuracy by jointly optimizing
the radar waveform xand amplitude vectors of RHSs ψt,ψr.
According to [6], we adopt the weighted sum of relative
entropy as the optimization objective. Specifically, the relative
entropy D(p(x)∥q(x)) =R+∞
−∞p(x) log
p(x)
q(x)
dxmeasures
the distance between probability distributions p(x)andq(x).
The larger the relative entropy, the easier the distinguishment
of different hypotheses. Therefore, we define the objectivefunction at (c+1)-th cycle as the weighted sum of the relative
entropy for any two hypotheses, which can be given by
¯d(c+1)=NHX

j=0ωi,jd(c+1)(Hi,Hj|y(c)),(8)
where the weights are chosen as ωi,j=p(c+1)(Hi)p(c+1)(Hj)
according to the idea that the distance between the hypothe-
ses with higher probabilities should be given more priority
in the maximization to further distinguish these hypotheses.
And d(c+1)(Hi,Hj|y(c)) = D 

In this section, a waveform and amplitude optimization
algorithm (WAOA) is proposed to solve (P1) by iteratively
optimizing the waveform and RHS amplitudes. In each it-
eration, we successively solve sub-problems (P x), (P t), and
(Pr). The overall algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. The
optimization algorithms for all the sub-problems are described
in the following subsections, respectively.
A. Waveform Optimization
According to the spectral theorem, the Hermitian matrix Sx
can be decomposed as Sx=UxDx(Ux)H, where Dxis a
diagonal matrix containing non-negative real numbers, and Ux
is a unitary matrix. Thus, by denoting x′= (Dx)1
2(Ux)Hx,
problem (P x) can be reformulated as

As proved in [7], the optimal solution of problem (P′

x′∗=√PMvx, where vxis the normalized eigenvector
corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of Rx′. Therefore, the
optimal solution to problem (Px)can be given by
x∗=h

B. Transmit Amplitude Optimization
Since ψtand(ψt)HRtψtin (15a) are both real, we have
(ψt)HRtψt= (ψt)HRe{Rt}ψt. Similar to problem (Px),
(Pt)is equivalent to the following problem

According to [8], problem (P′
t)is a non-convex problem,
which makes it hard to obtain the optimal solution. Therefore,
inspired by [9], we derive the approximated optimal solution
to(P′
t)in closed-form as follows:
Proposition 2: The optimal solution to (P′

imated by

where |·|means taking the Euclidean norm, and
µ±=abs(Re{u1})±Re{u1}
2, (24)
withu1being the eigenvector that corresponds to the largest
eigenvalue of Rt′, and abs (·)meaning taking the absolute
value of each element in the vector.
Proof: See Appendix B.
2IfSxis not positive definite, we compute the generalized inverse of Dx
to approximate (Dx)−1.C. Receive Amplitude Optimization
Due to the fractional form of (17a), problem (Pr)is hard
to tackle. Therefore, we reformulate (Pr)as follows [10]:
Lemma 1: Problem (Pr)is equivalent to

Proof: First, the objective function (17a) of (Pr)is

the optimal solution of (25a) is ξ∗

toPLr
l=1(UT
lψr)T[Bl(ψr)]−1(UT
lψr). Therefore, this
quadratic transform satisfies the requirements for an
equivalent transform as stated in [10].
Since the equivalence of problem (Pr)and(P′
r)is estab-
lished, we propose the receive beamforming algorithm to solve
problem (P′
r). Explicitly, (P′
r)can be solved by iteratively
solving the optimal solutions ξ∗andψr∗. In the i-th iteration,
ψr∗andξ∗are solved sequentially, and the value of (25a) si
is calculated. The iteration halts when |si−si−1| ≤ϵ′.ξ∗and
ψr∗can be solved based on the following methods:
1) Optimization of ξ:Equation (25a) in (P′

In this section, simulation results are provided to evaluate
the detection performance of the proposed RHS-enabled radar
system. The radar signal frequency is set as 30GHz. The ele-
ments spacings of the RHS and the phased array are λ/3[11]
andλ/2, respectively. We set the waveguide refractive index ν
as√
3, and attenuation factor αas5. The space of interest is
θ∈[0,2π), φ∈ {0, π/10}, and the azimuthal region [0,2π)
is evenly partitioned into 4angular grids. We suppose there
are two targets respectively located in directions (π/4, π/6)
and(3π/4, π/6), which corresponds to the hypothesis Hj.
Fig. 2(a) depicts the probability of detection versus hard-
ware cost3obtained by the proposed RHS scheme and the
phased array scheme given the same number of cycles 6.
Assume that the hardware cost of a phased array antenna is τ
times of that of an RHS element on average. According to [12],
τis set as 6. For simplicity, the cost of an RHS element is
normalized to 1. In the phased array scheme, considering the
transmission line loss, we set the amplitude attenuation of the
signal from the antenna to the feed as 0.9[13]. The optimiza-
tion technique of the phased array is designed based on the
method in [14]. We observe that the probability of detection of
both schemes increase as the hardware cost increases, implying
that the detection accuracy can be improved at the cost of
increasing hardware expenses. Moreover, it can be seen that
given the same cost, the detection probability of the proposed
RHS scheme has an increase of about 0.13compared to that
of the phased array one, indicating that the RHS can achieve
a higher detection accuracy compared to the phased array.
Fig. 2(b) illustrates the probability of detection versus
different numbers of cycles obtained by the proposed RHS-
enabled scheme with different lengths of the radar signals.
The numbers of RHS elements are set as Nt=Nr= 60 .
It can be seen that the probability of detection increases as
the number of cycles increases, verifying that the detection
accuracy can be improved by performing more cycles. In
addition, given the same number of cycles, the detection
probability of the RHS-enabled radar increases as the length
of the radar signal increases, indicating that the detection
accuracy can be improved by transmitting longer radar signals.
Fig. 2(c) depicts the probability of detection versus the
number of RHS elements with different values of PM. The
noise variance is set as σ2= 1. And we set the number of
cycles as 3. As the radiation power increases, the detection
probability increases given the element number. Besides, it can
be observed that the probability of detection increases as the
number of RHS elements increases, implying that the detection
performance can be improved by increasing the physical size
of the RHS.

to serve as transmit and receive antennas. To optimize the de-
tection accuracy, we have formulated a relative entropy based
optimization problem and proposed an iterative algorithm to
jointly optimizing the radar waveform and the beamforming
vectors of the transmit and receive RHSs. Simulation results
show that: 1) the proposed RHS-enabled radar can increase
the probability of detection by 0.13on average compared to
phased array radars when six cycles are performed given the
same hardware cost; 2) The detection accuracy of the proposed
RHS-enabled radar system can be improved by increasing the
physical aperture of the RHS, the radiation power, and the
length of the radar signal.

The relative entropy between distributions of hypotheses Hi
andHj(i̸=j)can be given by
D(p(y|Hi)∥p(y|Hj))

.(28)
Therefore, the distance between HiandHj(i̸=j)can be
expressed as
d(Hi,Hj|y) =D(p(y|Hi)∥p(y|Hj)) +D(p(y|Hj)∥p(y|Hi))
= (ui−uj)HΣ−1(ui−uj).

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2
According to spectral theorem, Rt′can be approximated by
γ1u1uT

responding eigenvector. Therefore, (P′
t)can be approximated
by maximizing γ1uT

Since ψt

sinceψt∗needs to satisfy (15c), let C+= 1/|(St)−1

C−= 1/|(St)−1
