ABSTRACT
Billions of live-streaming viewers share their opinions on scenes
they are watching in real-time and interact with the event, com-
mentators as well as other viewers via text comments. Thus, there
is necessary to explore viewers’ comments with scenes in E-sport
live-streaming events. In this paper, we developed CS-lol , a new
large-scale dataset containing comments from viewers paired with
descriptions of game scenes in E-sports live-streaming. Moreover,
we propose a task, namely viewer comment retrieval, to retrieve the
viewer comments for the scene of the live-streaming event. Results
on a series of baseline retrieval methods derived from typical IR
evaluation methods show our task as a challenging task. Finally,
we release CS-lol and baseline implementation to the research com-
munity as a resource.

viewers in 2022 [ 10,15]. Understanding E-sports viewers, such as
their opinions and preferences, is an important issue in E-sports
live-streaming. An example of E-sports live-streaming is given in
Fig. 1. Different from the traditional live broadcasts on television, E-
sports viewers not only watch events but are also capable of sharing
their opinions to the scene of event they are watching and interact
with other viewers via an interactive function on live-streaming
platforms such as texting chat in Twitch1or texting bullet comment
function in Douyu2. The viewer comment is a valuable resource for
understanding E-sports viewers since it is not only realistic feed-
back data but also able to be collected without disturbing viewers’
watching experiences.
However, as introduced by Ringer et al. [ 18], the live-streaming
viewer comment is a challenging domain that differs from text in
other domains due to its nature and its topical content. Additionally,
to understand the meaning of the viewer comment, it is important
to take its relatedness with the scene into account since viewers
comment at the time they are watching. Although research atten-
tion on live-streaming data [ 1,11,20] is significantly increasing
recently, due to lack of available resources, in-depth studies on
the live-streaming viewer comment are still rare. In this paper, we

further encourage research in understanding and utilizing viewer
comments by introducing the description of the game scene that is
paired with the viewer comment.
To summarize, this paper introduces CS-lol3, a novel dataset con-
sisting large-scale of sets of a viewers’ Comments and descriptions
ofScenes of a E-sports live-streaming game League ofLegends to
inspire future research on understanding viewer comment. Addi-
tionally, this paper proposes the task of viewer comment retrieval,
in which we retrieve the viewer comments from all comments
(retrieve from viewer comment database if in practical use) for a
game scene in E-sports live-streaming for understanding the viewer.
Finally, the characteristics and availability of CS-lol and report re-
sults on a series of baseline IR methods derived from conducted
experiments are reported.
2 RELATED WORK
In terms of improving the live-streaming viewer experience, there is
a growing interest among academics and industry professionals in
studying videos and live-streaming of E-sports [ 17]. Therefore, with
the emergence of recent advancements in natural language pro-
cessing and the growing need to understand textual data, research
focus to E-sports gameplay textual data as well as the description
of game scenes [ 5,22,25,27,30], or analyze focus on game data
stream [1, 12, 24, 26], are steadily increasing.
There is a considerable amount of research or literature studies
on live-streaming viewers by case studies or comparative stud-
ies using designed factors and use significant tests to verify their
ideas [ 8,9]. However, most of these research are either case-based
or use a different source of nonpublic data that lack reproducibilities
and incompatibilities to extend their findings to practical use [23].
The relation between an E-sports game scene and the viewers’
preference for E-sports live-streaming to such scene is still obscure.
To the best of our knowledge, the dataset closest to ours is
TwitchChat , by Ringer et al. [ 18], who first introduced a dataset con-
taining Twitch viewer comments with dataset analysis and publicly
available. As mentioned before, since viewer comments were given

at the time of the scene, the information of the scene is also nec-
essary for understanding viewer comments, especially in E-sports
live-streaming, our work further explores viewer comments by at-
taching comments with the scene. Besides, we also investigate the
possible use cases by proposing the viewer comment retrieval task
to indicate the usability of live-streaming viewer comments and
possible future research directions.
3 DATASET CONSTRUCTION AND ANALYSIS
In this section we describe the development and characteristics of
CS-lol . We have publicly released the CS-lol dataset. There are three
kinds of data in the CS-lol dataset:
•Scene information: descriptions (descriptive text) for game
scene produced by game commentators derived by ASR (Au-
tomatic Speech Recognition) system integrated in YouTube .
•Viewer comment: the title of the video, comments given by
viewers. We anonymized the viewer information to prevent
privacy issues.
•Pertinence score: pertinence score between comments game
scene information and viewer comments.
3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
The overview of the comment process that how E-sports live-
streaming viewer’ comments, the construction of the dataset with
both game scene information and corresponding viewer comments,
and the availability in practical use in the live-streaming are givenCS-lol: a Dataset of Viewer Comment with Scene in E-sports Live-streaming CHIIR ’23, March 19–23, 2023, Austin, TX, USA
in Fig. 2. We collected data from E-sports professional events from
a video game named League of Legends , the most popular game
having billions of viewers over the world according to the latest
research [ 15]. To this end, we extracted comments produced by
well-trained professional commentators from 20 matches of the
League of Legends E-sports professional match videos for our dataset.
The data in our dataset are collected from two platforms, scene
information (descriptions) from YouTube and viewer comment from
Twitch respectively. For the extracted 20 matches, we identify two
replay videos separately from YouTube andTwitch having the same
streaming of an E-sport match and align two videos manually. In
terms of collecting game scene information from YouTube , we use
YouTube API4to get the transcripts of the description given by the
commentator with a timestamp of an E-sport match. In terms of
collecting viewers’ comments, we manually search the clip from
live-streaming replays from Twitch that have the exact contents of
the aforementioned YouTube clip. Then we slice the corresponding
content from the beginning to the end of the match to ensure the
exact match of the same content and the equal length between
video clips from two different sources. In addition, there is an con-
siderable comments (see Table 2) on Twitch are (1) extremely short,
and/or (2) only have emotes (special emoji in Twitch ) that not appear
in description. Comments under these two cases contain little infor-
mation, so we removed emotes referring to Twitch5and comments
that contain less than three words.
3.2 Labelling Pertinence Score
We combine scene information extracted from YouTube and viewers’
comment extracted from Twitch by aligning content from two differ-
ent sources. According to the literature on watching live-streaming
E-sports games on Twitch platform [ 2,3], when a viewer tries to
comment during E-sports, live-streaming, (1) the time viewer spend
on typing the comments must be considered. According to a user
study [ 16], the average typing speed 𝑊𝑃𝑀𝑘on keyboard is 52
words per minute and 𝑊𝑃𝑀𝑠is 38 words per minute on smart-
phone, we take the average of 𝑊𝑃𝑀𝑘and𝑊𝑃𝑀𝑠as the viewer
typing speed into account. For each match, we have 𝑖descriptions
on game scenes and 𝑗comments on game scenes to label each com-
ment and description, given a timestamp of a comment 𝑇𝑐having
𝑛𝑤words and a timestamp of a description 𝑇𝑑, (2) the viewer could
not forecast the future scene in live-streaming. Thus, the pertinence
score𝑃𝑒𝑟was calculated by the equation as follow:
𝑃𝑒𝑟(𝑑𝑖,𝑐𝑗)=(
−(𝑇𝑐−𝑇𝑑−0.5∗(𝑊𝑃𝑀 𝑘+𝑊𝑃𝑀 𝑠)∗𝑛𝑤
60)𝑇𝑐>=𝑇𝑑
−∞ 𝑇𝑐<𝑇𝑑
(1)
Where𝑑𝑖donates𝑖th description and 𝑐𝑗donates𝑗th comment
from all matches in CS-lol . For each game scene, we rank com-
ments by𝑃𝑒𝑟and attach the top-20 comments with the highest
𝑅𝑒𝑙. As a result, we get CS-lol : a dataset consisting of E-sports de-
scriptions representing E-sports live-streaming game scenes, scene
corresponding viewer comments, and Pertinence scores between
a game scene information and viewer comments. The statistics

descriptions and viewers’ comments are shown in Fig. 3.
4 VIEWER COMMENT RETRIEVAL
4.1 Task Definition
In this paper, we focus on the problem of retrieving viewer com-
ments on scene in game event for E-sports live-streaming. The
problem tackled in this work is defined as, given a game scene
description, a rank list of viewer comments in the comments log in
order of the pertinence to the description are retrieved. Specifically,
the input consists of a description 𝑞and a set of comments 𝐷that
are derived from all matches. The output of our problem is a ranked
list of comments, i.e. r=(𝑟1,𝑟2,...,𝑟|𝐷|)where𝑟𝜋(𝑖)=𝑑𝑖and𝜋(𝑖)
denotes the rank of the 𝑖-th comment in 𝐷.
4.2 Experiment Settings
We utilize BM25 [ 19], query likelihood with Dirichlet smooth-
ing (QLD) [ 31], query likelihood with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing
(QLJM) [ 31], and sequential dependence model (SDM) [ 14] as base-
lines. We implemented these models using Anserini [ 29]. In terms of
these models’ parameters, we follow the default settings of Anserini.
As mentioned in Huang et al. [ 4], the automatic generated punc-
tuated description extracted from Youtube is not originally punctu-
ated following sentences spoken by commentator. Generally, using
only one line of automatically generated description is not capable
to involve a whole sentence of commentary into the query. Thus,
for retrieving viewer comments for 𝑞𝑡where𝑡refers to the time
when the commentator gives the description, 𝑞𝑡−1and𝑞𝑡−2also
be included empirically. Besides, for preprocessing Twitch com-
ments, we apply rule-based word cleaning in Ringer et al. [ 18] on
the viewer comment for fixing word expansion/misspelling in com-
ments. Stemming and stopword removal were also conducted for
both the description and the viewer comment before retrieval.
4.3 Experiment Result
Table 1 shows the evaluation results on lexical word matching by
standard evaluation metrics, including precision (P), recall (R), and
F1 score (F1). Table 3 among baseline retrieval methods in terms
of nDCG@3, 5, 10 and 20. Bold font indicates the highest score
for each metric. According to table 1, QLDM performs better in
matching words. In ranking results evaluated on nDCG metric,
SDM outperformed other models.
According to table 3, baseline methods that are based on lexical
matching perform poor, and we found that BM25 is not the best
model as “usual”, we assume this might be caused by the partic-
ularity of our task, namely, the query is relatively long, and the
document is highly concise. Thus, the newly formulated retrieval
tasks could be “non-traditional”.
5 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In this section, we further discuss the availability of CS-lol by in-
troducing its future uses in IR and NLP fields.CHIIR ’23, March 19–23, 2023, Austin, TX, USA Xu et al.

5.1 CS-lol for IR
As shown in Section 4, we implement the IR baseline retrieve meth-
ods for the viewer comment retrieval task. For reproducibility, we
release the source code of our implementation of IR baseline meth-
ods. The traditional retrieval models based on lexical matching
used in this work were poorly performed, as these methods are not
considering the semantic meaning of words. As we there are a large
number of synonyms in descriptions and comments, we believe
that using retrieval models that take semantic information, such
as the neural dense passage retrieval method [ 7], embedded with
knowledge graph [ 32] or external knowledge [ 28], can significantly
improve performance.5.2 CS-lol for NLP
Some recent works focus on Natural Language Generation on tra-
ditional sports and E-sports, but rare works on Natural Language
Understanding, especially in real-world settings. Perceivably, we
could use CS-lol dataset on NLP tasks such as named entity recog-
nition (NER) that aims to identify text spans that mention named
entities and to classify them into predefined categories. Conducting
dependency parse to extract the underlying relations between the
entities is also helpful [13]. Besides, one future direction might be
to employ E-sports experts for additional annotations with their
expertise on CS-lol . We believe such annotation could considerably
improve our understanding of the E-sports wording in the real-
world setting to contribute to the E-sports research community.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset CS-lol containing com-
ments from viewers paired with descriptions of the game scene
in E-sports live-streaming events. We present viewer comment re-
trieval, a task of retrieving the viewer comments that correspond
to the scene description to understand the viewer in real-time live-
streaming. We describe the development, characteristics, and avail-
ability of CS-lol . Experimental results using the IR baseline retrieval
methods on our proposed task and discussions on future directions
ofCS-lol are also given. In future work, we plan to apply and ex-
tend our CS-lol as well as approach to contribute to the research
community of E-sports and traditional sports.
