ABSTRACT
We study the prospects of Gaussian processes (GP), a machine learning (ML) algorithm, as a tool to re-
construct the Hubble parameter 𝐻(𝑧)with two upcoming gravitational wave missions, namely the evolved
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). Assuming various background
cosmological models, the Hubble parameter has been reconstructed in a non-parametric manner with the help
of GP using realistically generated catalogs for each mission. The effects of early-time and late-time priors
on the reconstruction of 𝐻(𝑧), and hence on the Hubble constant ( 𝐻0), have also been focused on separately.
Our analysis reveals that GP is quite robust in reconstructing the expansion history of the Universe within the
observational window of the specific missions under consideration. We further confirm that both eLISA and
ET would be able to provide constraints on 𝐻(𝑧)and𝐻0which would be competitive to those inferred from
current datasets. In particular, we observe that an eLISA run of ∼10-year duration with ∼80detected bright
siren events would be able to constrain 𝐻0as good as a∼3-year ET run assuming ∼1000bright siren event
detections. FurtherimprovementinprecisionisexpectedforlongereLISAmissiondurationssuchasa ∼15-year

1.INTRODUCTION
After the profound success of the LIGO Scientific and Virgo Collaborations in paving the way for gravitational wave (GW)
astronomy (Abbott et al. 2016, 2017a,b, 2019, 2021b,c), a number of ground- and space-based GW missions are currently being
planned, most of which are expected to be functional within a couple of decades. The space-based Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA) (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017; Klein et al. 2016; Tamanini et al. 2016) and the ground-based Einstein Telescope
(ET) (Maggiore et al. 2020; Sathyaprakash et al. 2010) are particularly promising future missions in this regard. Alongside their
conventional prospect of contributing to GW astronomy, their roles in cosmology and cosmography are also being investigated
to a thorough extent. Designed to explore farther into the redshift space than currently available experiments, these missions are
potentially interesting probes of the Hubble parameter as they will be capable of providing an independent measurement of the
luminosity distance based on the GW waveforms of detected standard siren events (Schutz 1986). In fact, the pressing need for
constrainingtheHubbleconstant( 𝐻0)throughmulti-messengerobservationsatintermediateredshiftsisdrivenbyafundamental
inadequacy of the current cosmological paradigm.

The concordance ΛCDM model of cosmology is, of late, facing tensions on multiple fronts when subjected to observational
tests. The Hubble tension, being the most severe one among them at ∼5𝜎, has lately been a matter of much deliberation. The
inconsistency between the measurements of 𝐻0fromPlanck2018 ( 67.36±0.54km s-1Mpc-1) by Aghanim et al. (2020a) and
from direct observations such as SH0ES ( 73.30±1.04km s-1Mpc-1) by Riess et al. (2022) warrants a deep investigation into
the systematics and methodologies of the missions, as well as into the assumed cosmological models. On closer inspection, the
conflict extends beyond a Planck-vs-SH0ES dichotomy and appears to be one between various early time measurements of 𝐻0
on one hand and late time measurements on the other. While the Planck2018 best-fit value of 𝐻0sits well with DES clustering
and weak lensing data combined with BAO spectroscopic surveys (Abbott et al. 2018b), a number of complementary direct
measurementprobesbesidesSH0ESconsistentlyreportahighervalue(Jang&Lee2017;Freedmanetal.2019,2020;Yuanetal.
2019; Huang et al. 2010; Pesce et al. 2020; Wong et al. 2020). With the systematics being an unlikely culprit (Aghanim et al.
2017; Kevin et al. 2019; Vagnozzi 2020), a plethora of alternatives to the vanilla ΛCDM model have been proposed to resolve
this tension (Knox & Millea 2020; Di Valentino et al. 2021; Shah et al. 2021; Efstathiou 2021; Schöneberg et al. 2022; Dainotti
etal.2021,2022). Furthermore,onthebasisofsomegeneralizedclassesofcosmologicalmodels,ithasalsobeenshownthatthe
Hubble tension might in fact be quite generic to current datasets (Bhattacharyya et al. 2019). In recent years, these findings have
motivated the community to look forward to future GW missions as an alternative probe of 𝐻0at intermediate redshifts, distinct
from both early and late-time measurements.
Thequantitativescopeofconstraining 𝐻0usingGWdataisunderactiveinvestigationandhasshownpromisebasedonexisting
datasets(Fishbachetal.2019;Soares-Santosetal.2019;Abbottetal.2021a,2017c,2023;Fungetal.2023),althoughthelimited
number of events at present entails wide error bars. Such prospects at present are also, quite expectedly, restricted to fairly low
redshifts. For example, Borhanian et al. (2020) show that the upgraded LIGO and Virgo facilities would be able to constrain
the Hubble constant to ≲2%accuracy via a simultaneous measurement of the waveform, and host galaxy redshift from the GW
waveform, using dark sirens within 𝑧=0.1in five years. On the other hand, Chen et al. (2018) conclude that a 2%measurement
of𝐻0would be possible in five years, provided the events have reliable electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, or the host galaxy
redshifts can be determined using statistical approaches, up to redshifts of 𝑧=0.5. In order to tackle the degeneracy between
source masses and redshifts of binary black hole systems, Farr et al. (2019) propose a novel method of determining the redshifts
of such mergers relying on pair-instability supernova processes. They predict that 𝐻(𝑧)may be reconstructed at 6.1%in one
year, and to 2.9%in five years, at the pivot value of 𝑧=0.8. For cases where EM counterparts are absent, Gray et al. (2020)
study the effects on inferring redshifts of GW events using incomplete galaxy catalogs. Such lines of inquiry, alongside the
inherent limitations arising from sensitivity bounds of the present observatories, naturally lead to the question of how efficient
next-generation GW missions might be when it comes to the question of constraining the expansion history of our Universe.
Constraints based on future GW data are expected to be much more precise due to significantly higher numbers of detectable
events up to higher redshifts, whose prospects have been explored by multiple authors (Messenger & Read 2012; Jin et al. 2023;
Zhang et al. 2023; Califano et al. 2023; Seymour et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2022; Ghosh et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2022; Cao et al.
2022; Feeney et al. 2021; Mortlock et al. 2019; Kyutoku & Seto 2017; Jana et al. 2023). However, the predicted results show
dependenceonthechoiceofcosmologicalparameterswhenrealdataisabsentandforecastsarecarriedoutusingmission-specific
mock standard siren catalogs (Shah et al. 2023).
In the absence of a consensus model for cosmic acceleration, there have been attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary history
that directly fits with observations without assuming any particular model parametrization (see Bilicki & Seikel (2012); Ishida
& de Souza (2011); Gómez-Valent (2019); Arjona & Nesseris (2020); Bengaly et al. (2020); Wang et al. (2020); Mukherjee &
Banerjee(2021a);Mehrabi&Rezaei(2021)andreferencestherein). So,anon-parametricreconstructionoftheHubbleparameter
as a function of redshift using simulated future GW mission data may serve as a powerful predictive tool at this stage, until we
have direct data from those missions at hand. Machine learning (ML) algorithms like Gaussian processes (GP) may play an
important role for this purpose.
Gaussian processes (Rasmussen & Williams 2005) are a generic supervised learning algorithm designed to solve regression
and probabilistic classification problems, depending on whether the output is continuous or discrete. Over the last decade, GP
has become particularly popular in cosmology for reconstructing dark energy (Holsclaw et al. 2011; Seikel et al. 2012; Zhang
& Li 2018) and modified theories of gravity (Zhou et al. 2019; Belgacem et al. 2020; Yang 2021; Bernardo & Levi Said 2021),
exploringtheinteractionbetweendarkmatteranddarkenergy(Yangetal.2015;Mukherjee&Banerjee2021b;Caietal.2017),

2021; Mukherjee et al. 2023), constraining spatial curvature (Yang & Gong 2021; Dhawan et al. 2021; Mukherjee & BanerjeeReconstruction of 𝐻(𝑧)using GWs and ML 3
2022) and in cosmographic studies (Shafieloo et al. 2012; Mukherjee & Banerjee 2021a; Jesus et al. 2022). For a pedagogical
introduction to GP, one can refer to the Gaussian process website 1.
In this paper, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the Hubble parameter using Gaussian process regression (GPR)
from future gravitational wave mission data. This exercise will further help us investigate the status of the Hubble tension,
complementary to the latest available datasets. We take eLISA (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017; Klein et al. 2016; Tamanini et al.
2016) and ET (Maggiore et al. 2020; Sathyaprakash et al. 2010) as two specific examples of next-generation missions to focus
on. Taking each mission’s specifications into account, we generate mock catalogs of standard sirens for a few representative
cosmological models, and employ GPR to reconstruct 𝐻(𝑧)and thereby infer 𝐻0directly in a non-parametric manner. Owing to
our focus on luminosity distance data, we have specifically chosen models which encapsulate late-time modifications to ΛCDM.

2.STEPS TOWARDS RECONSTRUCTION
In pursuit of our goal to obtain a non-parametric reconstruction of the Hubble parameter, we implement the steps outlined in
the ensuing subsections, taking into consideration the following arguments:
1. Wegeneraterealisticmockcatalogsthatincorporateinstrumentalspecificationsandaccountforallpossiblesourcesoferror
for two future GW missions, eLISA and ET separately, to reconstruct the Hubble diagram along with its associated errors.
2. Inordertosimulateamockcatalog,asetoffiducialparametervaluesmustbespecified. However,thereisnouniquechoice
of fiducial values and this choice may influence the results. Therefore, to select fiducial values that are most realistic, we
have taken into consideration the constraints from present datasets on each model.
3. To ensure that our analysis is unbiased towards any specific realization, as the results may be sensitive to the initial dataset
provided, we assemble multiple realizations of these mock catalogs for a particular mission.
4. Thechoiceoffiducialvaluesmaypartiallydrawthemockcatalogandhencethereconstructedvaluestowardsthatparticular
dataset from which the fiducials were inferred, leading to potential bias in the subsequent analysis. In view of the rising
discrepancybetweenearlyandlatetimeobservationsoftheHubbleparameter,twodifferentsetsoffiducialsareconsidered:
one using constraints from early time observations, and the other from late time observations.
5. Finally, the results obtained for two different future GW missions, eLISA and ET have been comparatively analyzed.
By doing so, we believe, the entire analysis would be considered free from any potential bias due to any particular mission or
choice of mock catalog, thereby yielding more reliable and robust results for the GW missions under consideration.

2.2.Generation of mock GW catalogs

(Amati et al. 2018), the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) (Kissler-Patig & Lyubenova 2009), the Advanced Telescope for High
Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA+) (Piro et al. 2022), and the Daksha satellites (Bhalerao et al. 2022) can help in rapid detection

employingadvancedstatisticaltechniquestoestimatetheredshiftsofassociatedgalaxies(Mukherjee&Wandelt2018),orcross-
correlating GW catalogs with large-scale structure observations (Scelfo et al. 2018). ET is expected to observe events from a
minimum of 𝑧=0.07to a maximum of 𝑧∼2with SNR>8. The lower cutoff is maintained to exclude sources which require
modelizationofthelocalHubbleflowbeforeincludingthemintheanalysis(Zhaoetal.2011). Togenerateoureventcatalog,we
usethestandardexpressionforthenumberdensityoftheobservedeventswithinsomeredshiftinterval(Sathyaprakashetal.2010),
which is a function of the coalescence rate at a given redshift. This rate is obtained via a fit to the observationally determined
starformationhistory(Schneideretal.2001). Wegenerate 𝑑𝐿samplesaccordingtothesedistributions. Togetanestimateofthe
uncertainties on 𝑑𝐿, we add in quadrature the instrumental error (Zhao et al. 2011) and the error due to lensing (Sathyaprakash
et al. 2010).
The space-based eLISA mission is expected to revolutionize our understanding of cosmic history by probing massive black
hole binaries (MBHBs). High SNR detection of MBHB coalescence will yield accurate direct measurements of their luminosity
distance. Additionally, simultaneous detection of EM counterparts would be possible for events with SNR >8and a sufficiently

To generate mock catalogs, we draw plausible redshift values for MBHB mergers from an interpolated 𝛽distribution, based on
the data presented in Fig. 1 of Tamanini et al. (2016). The lower bound is introduced at 𝑧 <0.1, to match our expectations of
not finding MBHBs at very low redshift (Speri et al. 2021). To estimate a realistic 1 𝜎error on𝑑𝐿to each MBHB merger event,
we combine the uncertainties contributed by lensing (Tamanini 2017; Hirata et al. 2010; Shapiro et al. 2010), peculiar velocity
corrections (Tamanini 2017; Kocsis et al. 2006), instrumental precision (Marsat et al. 2021; Speri et al. 2021), and redshift error
associated with photometric measurements (Dahlen et al. 2013; Ilbert et al. 2013).
Keeping these assumptions and arguments in mind, we generate mock catalogs so as to give a reliable number of data points
for each mission. In order to get rid of any potential bias from a particular mock catalog, we generate 500 mock catalogs of
observable bright siren events for each case in our study (see Table 2). We also make some modifications to the methodology
outlinedinFerreiraetal.(2022)tomakethecatalogsmorerealisticasmentionedinShahetal.(2023). Hereisabriefoutlineof
our adopted methodology:
•ObtainthesetofredshiftsofbrightsireneventsforbotheLISAandETbysamplingfromthetheoreticalredshiftdistribution
based on the specifications of each mission.
•Choosing a particular cosmological model, calculate the theoretical luminosity distance 𝑑{𝑡ℎ}
𝐿(𝑧)at the sampled redshifts.
•Estimate the total error Δ𝑑𝐿(𝑧)by taking into account the different sources of error which affect the measurement of the
luminosity distance for each mission.
•Obtain the simulated 𝑑𝐿(𝑧)by randomly sampling from a normal distribution N(𝑑{𝑡ℎ}
𝐿(𝑧),Δ𝑑𝐿(𝑧)).
This gives us a set of event redshifts {𝑧}, the corresponding luminosity distances {𝑑𝐿(𝑧)}, and the observational errors in
determining the latter {Δ𝑑𝐿(𝑧)}. Such a set constitutes an individual catalog corresponding to each combination of mission,
cosmological model and observational prior.
3.GAUSSIAN PROCESS RECONSTRUCTION
Let us begin with a brief description of the ML tool, namely the Gaussian process (Rasmussen & Williams 2005; Seikel et al.
2012;Shafielooetal.2012),thatwearegoingtouseinouranalysis. AGaussianprocessinvolvesanindexedcollectionofrandom
variableshavingamultivariatenormal(MVN)distribution,usedtoinferadistributionoverfunctionsdirectlywithinacontinuous
domain. For a given set of observational data, one can use GP to reconstruct the most probable underlying continuous function
describing that data and the associated confidence levels, without limiting to any particular parametrization ansatz. Thus, GP
serves as a powerful, non-parametric tool for statistical modeling.
For undertaking GPR, our assumption is that the observational data with Gaussian noise, as well as the predicted function,
jointly underlie an MVN distribution, described solely by a mean vector and a covariance matrix. Thus, given a mock 𝑑𝐿vs𝑧
catalog, we can employ GP to reconstruct 𝑑𝐿(𝑧)and𝜎𝑑𝐿(𝑧)directly from data, without assuming any model parametrization.
The reconstructed function at some redshift 𝑧is characterized by a mean 𝜇(𝑧)=E[𝑑𝐿(𝑧)]and covariance function (also called
“kernel") cov(𝑑𝐿(𝑧),𝑑𝐿(˜𝑧))=𝜅(𝑧,˜𝑧), which correlates values of the function between two redshifts, 𝑧and˜𝑧, respectively. As
prior information for the predictions, we assume a zero mean function to ensure a cosmological model-independent analysis.
Hence, the choice of kernel determines almost all the generalization properties of our GPR.
A wide range of possible covariance functions is available in the literature (Rasmussen & Williams 2005; Seikel et al. 2012).
The most general and standard choice is the squared exponential covariance,
𝜅(𝑧,˜𝑧)=𝜎2

where,𝑙and𝜎𝑓are the characteristic length scale and noise variance, known as the hyperparameters of our GP model. Note
𝑙roughly corresponds to the distance one needs to move along 𝑧before𝑑𝐿significantly changes, whereas 𝜎𝑓describes typical
changes in the value of 𝑑𝐿.Reconstruction of 𝐻(𝑧)using GWs and ML 7

The squared exponential kernel is indefinitely differentiable and for a reconstruction involving an 𝑛th order derivative, the
Matérn𝜈covariance works well if 𝜈 > 𝑛. Note that the reconstruction kernel plays a significant role and the final results are
sensitive to this choice. Imposing greater differentiability, hence a greater degree of smoothness, leads to strong correlations in
the reconstructed functions and their derivatives, resulting in tighter bounds on the uncertainties. As the present work requires
the use of second-order kernel derivatives, in this work, we choose the Matérn 𝜈=9/2covariance,

as suggested in Seikel & Clarkson (2013). Moreover, it has been shown in Ó Colgáin & Sheikh-Jabbari (2021) that the
reconstructed errors decrease as 𝜈→∞(squared exponential kernel), but the difference between 𝜈=5/2and∞is not highly
striking. With the marginalized covariance function, the data can be extended to the redshift range 𝑧, specific to a particular
mission, for obtaining a smooth continuous function for 𝑑𝐿with respective uncertainties 𝜎𝑑𝐿.
As a demonstrative example, consider a single eLISA mock catalog generated assuming the baseline ΛCDM model. We have
used a python-implementation for GP, being simple linear algebra. In the next section, we will extensively make use of this
algorithm for other catalogs. Given a set of training inputs 𝑍={𝑧𝑖}from the𝑑𝐿(𝑍)vs𝑍GW mock catalog (Sec. 2.2) with
noise𝜎𝑑𝐿(𝑍), we use GPR to make predictions of 𝑑𝐿(𝑍★)on a test set of redshifts 𝑍★=

. The prior covariance matrix
between the training points 𝜅(𝑍,𝑍)is defined as[𝜅(𝑍,𝑍)]𝑖𝑗=𝜅(𝑧𝑖,𝑧𝑗). Similarly, we also obtain the prior covariances between
thetrainingvstestandtestvstestredshiftsas 𝜅(𝑍,𝑍★)and𝜅(𝑍★,𝑍★)respectively. So,thejointpriordistributionofthetraining

andCis the covariance matrix of the mock data.
The predictive distribution is given by ∼N(𝑑𝐿(𝑍★),cov[𝑑𝐿(𝑍★),𝑑𝐿(𝑍★)]), where the predicted mean vector, 𝑑𝐿(𝑍★)and
the covariance matrix cov[ 𝑑𝐿(𝑍★),𝑑𝐿(𝑍★)] are,

cov[𝑑𝐿(𝑍★),𝑑𝐿(𝑍★)]=𝜅(𝑍★,𝑍★)−𝜅(𝑍★,𝑍)[𝜅(𝑍,𝑍)+C]−1𝜅(𝑍,𝑍★). (6)
Again, GP can also be used to reconstruct the derivatives of 𝑑𝐿, assuming these derivatives also follow a joint MVN with the
observed data. The mean vector and the covariance matrix corresponding to the first derivative 𝑑𝐿′are given by,

4.ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
The present analysis reveals that GP can be a useful tool to reconstruct the Hubble parameter for future GW missions, at least
to a moderately good redshift range. Our results also demonstrate the level of precision at which these next-generation missions
should be able to constrain both the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter 𝐻(𝑧)and its present value 𝐻0.
The1𝜎error of the reconstructed value of 𝐻0shown in Fig. 6 and 7 generically decreases with an increase in the number of
events,irrespectiveofthechoiceofthebackgroundcosmologicalmodel,theGWmission,andthesetoffiducialparametervalues
usedtogeneratethecatalogs. Itrevealstheconstrainingpowerofthesetwomissionsfor 𝐻0withrelativelylesserrorthancurrent
observations. Besides, the mean value of the reconstructed 𝐻0typically falls within its corresponding fiducial bounds in a stable
manner for a sufficiently large number of events and beyond. These results indicate a faithful reconstruction. The saturation of
the error with the number of events is, of course, set by the specifications of the individual mission.10 P. Mukherjee, R. Shah, A. Bhaumik, S. Pal

4.1.Comparison between eLISA and ET
Coming to a comparison between these two particular GW missions, we first note that while ET is expected to detect a
significantly higher number of bright sirens than eLISA up to 𝑧∼2, a typical∼10-year eLISA mission is predicted to constrain
𝐻0almost as precisely as ET, with longer mission durations generically tending to perform better than ET. This trend holds in
a robust fashion for both sets of mock catalogs. The superior performance of eLISA can be attributed partly to its enhanced
instrumentalsensitivity,andpartlytoitsabilityofprobinghigherredshiftsupto 𝑧∼8insearchofstandardsirens. Theimpactof
the former factor is further visible in the plots of the reconstructed redshift evolution of 𝐻(𝑧)in the range 0< 𝑧 < 2for ET and
eLISA (from Figs. 3 and 4), where the reconstruction in case of eLISA is seen to be much tighter compared to the one in case
of ET (Fig. 5). Nonetheless, a direct comparison between the expected number of events, detectable by ET ( ∼1000) and eLISA
(∼25), for a∼3-year mission duration (from Figs. 6 and 7) shows better performance of the former compared to the latter.Reconstruction of 𝐻(𝑧)using GWs and ML 11

4.2.Comparison among cosmological models
Based on the results obtained, we notice a few characteristic trends from Figs. 6 and 7. For ΛCDM, CPL, and JBP, the
reconstructed mean 𝐻0alongside its 1𝜎uncertainty tends towards a marginally higher value compared to the early-time prior
in the case of ET, while the reconstruction corresponding to the late-time prior shows no significant shift. This is somewhat
interesting from the perspective of the Hubble tension, although further studies with alternative ML algorithms are required in
order to make any strong comments in that direction. The same mean-shifting tendency is visible to some extent in the case
of eLISA as well for a realistic 10 −15 year mission duration, albeit with tighter error bars which make the reconstructed values
more consistent with the fiducials than in the case of ET. For the PEDE model, the opposite tendency is observed in the case
of both ET and eLISA with an increasing number of events, as the reconstructed 𝐻0shifts marginally towards lower values for
both early and late-time priors. This effect is not very significant though, as it still remains largely consistent with the fiducial
which also includes the reconstructed mean. The VM model displays mean-shifting characteristics quite similar to PEDE, with
the only difference being that the early-time fiducial value of 𝐻0in the case of VM is higher than the late-time one, as given by
the MCMC results. Finally, for the VM-VEV model, the reconstructed mean value of 𝐻0falls almost outside the 1 𝜎bounds of

reconstruction technique.
Based on the reconstructed 𝐻(𝑧)plots in Figs. 3 and 4, a few more model-specific features can be summarized. A unique
feature of the VM model appears in the form of a crossing between the two mean trajectories of 𝐻(𝑧)for the early and late-time
fiducials. This occurs in the approximate redshift region 0.1< 𝑧 < 0.2, beyond which the reconstruction based on the late-time
prior gives a higher value of 𝐻(𝑧)compared to the early-time one. While the VM model is capable of resolving the 𝐻0tension

5.CONCLUSIONS
In this article, we analyze the robustness of Gaussian processes (GP) in reconstructing the Hubble parameter in light of future
gravitational wave (GW) missions. We employ the following methodology, which enables us to assess the efficacy of GP in a
more or less robust and unbiased manner:
•We focus on the ground-based ET and the space-based eLISA as two representatives of next-generation GW detectors.
These missions aim to detect gravitational waves originating from different astrophysical phenomena by probing different
redshift ranges. This helps mitigate mission-specific dependencies within our general conclusions which are based on a
comparative study between the individual reconstruction results for both missions.
•We consider six different background cosmologies (including the concordance ΛCDM model as the benchmark). The
chosen scenarios incorporate late-time modifications on top of the vanilla 6-parameter picture that subsequently leads to
considerable variations in the theoretical 𝑑𝐿vs𝑧behavior. This, in turn, allows us to study various representative cases of
the same and arrive at conclusions which hold generically across a variety of cosmological models (Table 1).
•For each mission and model under consideration, we generate two sets of mock catalogs (Set-I and Set-II) using the
constraints obtained from currently available early-time (CSB) versus late-time (RSH) datasets as fiducials (Table 2).Reconstruction of 𝐻(𝑧)using GWs and ML 13
•We examine their relative effect on the reconstructed results, owing to the tension between early and late-time constraints
that persists particularly in the value of the Hubble constant. We have resorted to this disparate analysis involving two
distinct fiducials, assuming neither set to be indisputably correct in an a priorifashion.
ThereconstructedplotsoftheHubbleparameter 𝐻(𝑧)arestronglydependentonthechoiceofthefiducialsusedtogeneratethe
mock catalogs. However, under the same choice of fiducials, the reconstructions corresponding to the two different missions are
consistentwitheachotherforeachofthemodelsconsidered,whichindicatesafaithfulreconstructionprocess. Uponvaryingthe
number of detectable events or (equivalently) the mission duration, the presently observed mean value of the reconstructed 𝐻(𝑧)
and its associated 1𝜎error also show generic trends for both missions in accordance with their specifications. In particular, our
results confirm the following:
•GPisapowerfulandefficientnon-parametrictoolwhichcanbeusedtoreconstructtheHubblediagrambasedonstandard
siren datasets from multiple next-generation GW detectors, and hence constrain the value of the Hubble constant based on
GW luminosity distance data at intermediate redshifts.
•Concerningprecision,theresultsobtainedfroma ∼10-yeareLISAmissionarelikelytobeatparwiththosefroma ∼3-year
ETrun. Thus,thesefuturemissionshavethepotentialtoconstraincosmologicalparametersandprovideboundsthatwould
be competitive to present-day constraints.
•If the missions run for a longer duration, the reconstruction results show further improvement. For example, the relatively
tighter constraint on 𝐻0from a∼15-year eLISA mission can be readily compared with those from shorter runs in Fig. 7.
However, in this work, we have chosen not to combine the simulated data from eLISA and ET because of two primary sources
ofuncertainty: thedissimilarsystematicsofthemissions,andthequestionablephysicalvalidityofcombiningluminositydistance
data obtained with distinct instruments. We plan to explore this avenue in future work.
Moreover, a natural question that arises here is: What about other future GW missions, such as the DECi-hertz Interferometer
Gravitational-waveObservatory(DECIGO)(Mandeletal.2018;Kawamuraetal.2021;Zhangetal.2022),theBigBangObserver
(BBO) (Cutler & Harms 2006; Corbin & Cornish 2006), TianQin (Luo et al. 2016), Cosmic Explorer (Reitze et al. 2019), Taĳi
(Ruan et al. 2020) as well as ongoing GW missions such as the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (Abbott et al. 2018a) network and the
PulsarTimingArray(Hobbsetal.2010)? WehavealreadycarriedoutsomeinitialcheckswithDECIGO,whichproposesalarge
numberofdetectionsintheredshiftrange 0<𝑧< 5withaveryhighsignal-to-noiseratio(SNR).Wefoundthatthereconstructed
𝐻(𝑧), and hence𝐻0, obtained from a simulated catalog strongly mimic the fiducial values, albeit with increased precision. This
shows the reconstruction efficacy of GPs. At the same time, averaging over other realizations of the catalogs for DECIGO is not
expected to give much variability. However, given the success of GP for eLISA and ET, it would be intriguing to find out the
prospects of other GW missions that plan to probe events at relatively higher redshifts.
Furthermore, in the present study, we have exclusively focused on bright standard sirens, i.e. those with detectable electro-
magnetic counterparts. This choice is reasonable because upcoming optical and radio observatories like LSST, SKA+ELT, and
THESEUS/ATHENAareexpectedtoidentifytransientEMemissionsaccompanyinggravitationalwave(GW)events. Thiswould
aid in pinpointing the source galaxies’ locations and redshifts even at high redshifts. Recent reports from the operational James
WebbSpaceTelescope(JWST)showpromiseinprobingluminoussourcesbeyond 𝑧∼10viaEMobservations,determiningtheir
redshiftsthroughspectroscopyorphotometry(Curtis-Lakeetal.2023;Robertsonetal.2023;Larsonetal.2023;Juodžbalisetal.
2023; Maiolino et al. 2023). Future observatories’ improved capabilities are anticipated to enhance collaboration between GW
and EM facilities, enabling real-time study of high-redshift multi-messenger events and subsequent follow-ups of host galaxies.
If, on the other hand, dark sirens could also be localized with sufficient precision using galaxy cross-correlation or any other
viabletechnique(s)(Oguri2016;Mukherjeeetal.2022;Grayetal.2023),theiradditionwouldsignificantlyincreasethenumber

prospects have attracted considerable attention in recent years, in light of a number of proposed ground-based and space-based
GW missions (Seymour et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2022; Jin et al. 2023; Muttoni et al. 2023; Zhu & Chen 2023). As far as the
