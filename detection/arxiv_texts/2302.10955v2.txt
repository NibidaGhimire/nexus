Abstract
In Sen’s formulation of self-dual ﬁelds one ﬁnds two closed f orms:H(g)
andH(s). Only the former couples to sources and the spacetime metric .
The latter has the wrong sign kinetic term but decouples and h ence might
be regarded as an unphysical artifact. In this letter we illu strate how an
electromagnetic duality associated to the potential for H(s)gives rise to
a T-like duality in the partition function for H(g). We then compute the
partition function on a 4 k+2-dimensional torus highlighting its dependence
on the choice of ﬂux of H(s). Lastly we compute the two-point function of
Wilson Surface operators.
∗neil.lambert@kcl.ac.uk1 Introduction
After half a century of study self-dual ﬁelds, such as the eni gmatic chiral Boson, are still a
subject of fascination. Of course the case of a free chiral Bo son in two dimensions has been
well-understood for just as long. But self-dual ﬁelds and in particular interacting self-dual
ﬁelds, pop-up in a variety of contexts and dimensions D= 4k+ 2,k= 0,1,2,.... There has
been a recurrent and ongoing interest in Lagrangian models f or the free Abelian versions of
these theories [ 1–7] (see [8,9] for relations between some of these approaches). As well as a
variety of computations of the partition function [ 10–16]. On the other hand there is a general
understanding that although non-Abelian generalisations exist they do not admit Lagrangian
descriptions, at least in any standard way.
Here we wish to discuss some aspects of the Sen formulation of self-dual ﬁelds [ 17,18].
See [19] for a discussion of this approach and [ 19–23] for various applications and extensions.
A major beneﬁt of this formulation is that it is both Lorentz i nvariant and quadratic in the
ﬁelds. Thus one can in principle make all computations in the quantum theory. For example
[24] considered a T¯Tdeformation and, of particular relevance here, [ 25] computed the exact
partition function.
In the Sen formulation of self-dual ﬁelds one introduces a 2 kformBalong with a 2 k+ 1
formHthat is self-dual with respect to a ﬂat reference Minkowskia n metric η:H=⋆ηH.1In
the absence of sources the action can be written as
S[H,B] =1
(2π)4k+1/integraldisplay1
2dB∧⋆ηdB−2H∧dB+H∧M(H), (1.1)
whereMis a linear map from η-self-dual forms to η-anti-self-dual forms. The equations of
motion are such that
H(s)=1
2dB+1
2⋆ηdB+H
H(g)=H−M(H), (1.2)
are both closed. Clearly H(s)is self-dual with respect to the reference metric η. Furthermore
Mis constructed so that H(g)is self-dual with respect to the physical spacetime metric g.
Thus one ﬁnds two self-dual ﬁelds but with respect to diﬀerent metrics.
A key part of this approach is that Bhas the wrong sign kinetic term and hence is patho-
logical. Nevertheless B, through the combination H(s), decouples from any sources and the
physical metric gand hence its pathologies do not aﬀect the dynamics of the phys ically mean-
ingful ﬁeld H(g). In particular one ﬁnds that in a Hamiltonian formulation th e theory splits
into two, mutually non-interacting, systems described by H(s)andH(g)respectively. One is
therefore free to simply ignore the pathological dynamics a ssociated to H(s).
This all works very well but one issue is that the physical deg rees of freedom are contained
inH(g)whileBis unphysical. However many interesting questions about ch iral form ﬁelds
1More properly these are ‘pseudo-forms’ as their transforma tion under diﬀeomorphisms is non-standard.
2involve Wilson surface operators which can not be captured b y the ﬁeld strength H(g). In
particular we could be interested in objects of the form
WΣ=ei
(2π)2k/integraltext
ΣB, (1.3)
where Σ is a closed 2 k-cycle in spacetime (for detailed discussions in six-dimen sions see, for
example, [ 26–28]). The problem here is that Bis unphysical and a priori not related to the
physical ﬁeld H(g). So what is the meaning of WΣ? How can we capture non-local observables
associated to H(g)?
One answer to this question is to restrict to the sector H(s)= 0 where we can think of
Bas a potential for Hand hence H(g). We also note that in the reduction of the M5-brane
on a Riemann surface discussed in [ 19] it was found that the correct Seiberg-Witten dynamics
was only reproduced in an analogous restriction to vanishin g unphysical ﬂux. Furthermore in
string ﬁeld theory Boriginates from a string ﬁeld ˜Ψ which gives rise RR sources [ 29,30] and
therefore does have a physical role. This raises the more gen eral question of whether or not
theH(s)degrees of freedom have a more physical role to play than meet s the eye. In particular
it would appear that we shouldn’t simply discard Band hence H(s). Indeed, although this is
possible classically, in a complete quantum treatment this can not be done so simply.
Our mandate here is to understand the role of H(s)quantum mechanically within a path
integral formulation. In particular we want to rewrite the p artition function in the form
Z=/integraldisplay
dh(s)
A˜Z[h(s)
A], (1.4)
where
˜Z[h(s)] =/integraldisplay
[dH]n.z.[dB]eiS[B,H], (1.5)
andn.z.denotes thenon-zero modecontributions to thepartition fu nction whereas h(s)
Adenotes
the zero modes. In fact we will see that the integral reduces t o a sum over discrete ﬂuxes:
Z=/summationdisplay
h(s)
A˜Z[h(s)
A]. (1.6)
Oncethisis donewecanthenrestrictto h(s)
A= 0wherewecan thinkof Basalocal potential for
H. But one is free to make other choices too. Thus here we want to impose constraints on the
ﬂuxesh(s)
Aand understand the resulting partition functions. This int erpretation is reminiscent
of a relative ﬁeld theory [ 5,31] in that we ﬁnd a diﬀerent partition function for H(g)depending
on the choice of ﬂuxes of H(s).
Therefore to explore this question we propose to look at sect ors of the theory labelled by
the periods of H(s)over closed 2 k+1 cycles ΞA. Note that since H(s)is self-dual it is suﬃcient
to only include half the set of all closed 2 k+1 cycles. In particular we only consider ΞAthat
are Poincare dual to anti-self-dual harmonic forms ω−
A:
h(s)
A=1
(2πl)2k+1/integraldisplay
ΞAH(s)=1
2(2πl)4k+2/integraldisplay
H(s)∧ω−
A, (1.7)
3where the extra factor of 2 in the denominator in the second ex pression comes from our con-
ventions for ω−
A.
The calculation of the full partition function was presente d in detail in [ 25]. Here we will
revisit that calculation, separating out the zero-mode con tribution and re-interpreting it. It is
worth noting that that computation of the Euclidean partiti on function works in an interesting
and novel way that is unique to the Sen formulation. Rather th an Wick-rotating the time
coordinate we analytically extend the physical spacetime m etricgto a Euclidean one. One
then ﬁnds that all the geometrical information about the Euc lidean torus is contained in /tildewiderM.
As a result we can maintain the constraint H=⋆ηHand furthermore the wrong sign kinetic
term for Bis harmless as it remains oscillatory in the path integral. I nstead the damping
needed to tame the path integral comes from the imaginary par t of/tildewiderM.
Therest of this letter is structuredas follows. InSection 2 we show how the electromagnetic
duality of the B-ﬁeld in the Sen action leads to duality on the ﬂuxes of H(s)that is reminiscent
of T-duality. Our discussion here is similar to [ 13]. In section 3 we review the computation
of the partition function on a 4 k+ 2-dimensional torus T4k+2[25] but this time separating
out the contribution of the ﬂuxes h(s)
Aso that we can isolate the contribution of a single ﬂux
section. In section four we outline the computation of corre lation functions of Wilson surface
operators and give explicit results for the case of a chiral B oson. Lastly in section ﬁve we give
our conclusions and comments.
2 Duality
The Sen action admits a duality where we trade Bfor a dual 2 k-form˜B. To this end we
introduce F=dBand write
S[H,B] =1
(2π)4k+1/integraldisplay1
2F∧⋆ηF−2H∧F+H∧M(H)+˜B∧dF . (2.1)
As usual integrating out ˜Bleads todF= 0 and hence F=dB, giving us back the Sen action.
However we can also write it as
S[H,B] =1
(2π)4k+1/integraldisplay1
2F∧⋆ηF−2H∧F+H∧M(H)−d˜B∧F , (2.2)
and integrate out Fto ﬁnd
⋆ηF=−d˜B−2H . (2.3)
Substituting this back in to the Sen action leads to
S[H,B] =1
(2π)4k+1/integraldisplay1
2d˜B∧⋆ηd˜B−2H∧d˜B+H∧M(H), (2.4)
4so we have S[H,B] =S[H,˜B]. This will remain true in the presence of sources for H. However
it is curious to note that
H(s)=H+1
2dB+1
2⋆ηdB
=H+1
2F+1
2⋆ηF
=−/parenleftbigg
H+1
2d˜B+1
2⋆ηd˜B/parenrightbigg
≡ −˜H(s)(2.5)
In particular, from ( 2.3) we see that the condition
H(s)= 0 (2.6)
corresponds to dB=d˜B.
Next we observed that we can identify two conserved 2 k+1-forms
ΠN=−dB−2H
ΠT=⋆ηdB , (2.7)
which are co-closed. The ﬁrst is the Noether current associa ted to the conserved momentum
conjugate to Bwhereas the second is topological. We note that
H(s)=1
2(ΠT−ΠN). (2.8)
The associated charges are
QN(Ξ) =−1
(2π)2k+1/integraldisplay
Ξ⋆ηdB+2H
QT(Ξ) =1
(2π)2k+1/integraldisplay
ΞdB . (2.9)
where Ξ is a closed 2 k+1 cycle.
To obtain a non-trivial topological charge we must allow for conﬁgurations where Bis not
globally deﬁned. When thespacetime is atorus wecan thinkof this as includingwindingmodes
intoB; that is introducing a linear dependence of Bon the torus coordinates xµ, in analogy
with a chiral Boson. To enable this we note that the so-called large gauge transformations
B→B+ω , (2.10)
are symmetries provided dω= 0. In particular on the torus we allow for solutions where
B(xµ+2πlnµ) =B(xµ)+ω , (2.11)
wherenµis a unit vector along some direction. We then see that
1
(2π)2k+1/integraldisplay
S1×ΣdB=1
(2π)2k+1/integraldisplay
ΣB(xµ+2πlnµ)−1
(2π)2k+1/integraldisplay
ΣB(xµ)
=1
(2π)2k+1/integraldisplay
Σω , (2.12)
5where the S1factor comes from transporting Σ around a loop xµ→xµ+2πlnµ. Thus a ﬂux
quantization condition amounts to a restriction on which la rge gauge transformations we allow.
We choose to impose
QT(Ξ)∈R2k+1Z, (2.13)
whereRis a positive constant.
Next we introduce Wilson Surface operators of the form
Wp,Σ=eip
(2π)2k/integraltext
ΣB. (2.14)
These are invariant under gauge transformations B→B+dΛ but for Wp,Σto be well deﬁned
under large gauge transformations we require that
p
(2π)2k/integraldisplay
Σω∈2πZ. (2.15)
This in turn tells us that
p∈1
R2k+1Z. (2.16)
Since we identify pas the eigenvalue of the momentum operator we ﬁnd
QN(Ξ)∈1
R2k+1Z. (2.17)
In other words the momenta associated to the periods of Bare quantized. From which we
learn that the periods of H(s)satisfy
1
(2π)2k+1/integraldisplay
ΞH(s)∈1
2/parenleftbigg
R2k+1Z⊕1
R2k+1Z/parenrightbigg
. (2.18)
Finally we observe that the duality above corresponds to swa pping Π Nand ΠTand hence
R→1/Randplays aroleanalogous toT-duality. Thevanishingof the periodsof H(s)therefore
corresponds to the condition
QN(Ξ) =QT(Ξ), (2.19)
which is invariant under the duality.
3 The Partition Function Revisited
3.1 Preliminaries
Let us start by giving the complete form of the action we are in terested in including sources
[17,18]:
S[H,B;J] =1
(2π)4k+1/integraldisplay/parenleftbigg1
2dB∧⋆ηdB−2H∧dB+(H+J)∧/tildewiderM(H+J)+2H∧J−1
2J∧⋆ηJ/parenrightbigg
,
(3.1)
6and the corresponding partition function is
Z[J] =/integraldisplay
[dH][dB]eiSA[H,B;J]. (3.2)
Here the integral is over a T4k+2torus with periodic coordinates xµ∈[−πl,πl].
To evaluate the partition function we need to have introduce a basis of self-dual 2 k+ 1-
formsωA
+and anti-self-dual 2 k+ 1-forms ω−
AwhereA= 1,...,/parenleftBigg
4k+1
2k/parenrightBigg
. For concreteness
we choose the explicit basis ( i1< i2< ... < i 2k):
ωA
+= (1+⋆η)dx0∧dx1∧...dx2k
ω−
A=±(1−⋆η)dx0∧dx1∧...dx2k, (3.3)
where the sign is chosen such that
ωA
+∧ω−B= 2δA
Bdvol, (3.4)
and in this basis we can write
/tildewiderM(ωA
+) =/tildewiderMABω−
B. (3.5)
As stated in the introduction the role of /tildewiderMis to ensure that H−/tildewiderM(H) is self-dual
with respect to the physical spacetime metric g. To compute the partition function we want to
consider a Euclidean metric gwhile keeping the reference metric ηMinkowskian (so we can still
impose the constraint H=⋆ηH). Thus we Wick rotate the metric and not the coordinates,
as advocated in [ 32]. It was shown in [ 25] that/tildewiderMABbecomes complex but crucially the
imaginary part of /tildewiderMABis negative deﬁnite which leads to convergent Gaussian inte grals. Thus
even though there is a wrong-sign ﬁeld in the Lagrangian the p ath integral can be well-deﬁned
and convergent if we instead analytically continue the phys ical metric and not the spacetime
coordinates.
Furthermoreweintroducea/parenleftBigg

we make the explicit choice
ωa=dxµ1∧...∧dxµ2k, (3.6)
where the index a= (µ1,...,µ2k) withµ1< µ2< ... < µ 2k. It is helpful to expand
dxµ∧ωa=KµaBωB
++LµaBω−B, (3.7)
for some KµaBandLµaB. In particular
KµaA=1

Integrals are over a 4 k+2 torus T4k+2and sums are over integers.
3.2 Re-Evaluation of the Partition Function
Next we expand the functions HAandBain terms of constant modes, winding modes and
oscillating modes:
Ba=ba+wµaxµ+′/summationdisplay
naµba,naµeinaµxµ/lnaµ∈Z,
HA=hA+′/summationdisplay
nµhnµAeinµxµ/l, (3.12)
with (ba,naµ)∗=ba,−naµand (hA,naµ)∗=hA,−naµ. Furthermore the winding modes take the
form
wµa=/parenleftbiggR
l/parenrightbigg2k+1
mµamµa∈Z, (3.13)
for some constant R. Note that for k >0 not all wµaare independent, i.e.diﬀerent choices
lead to the same ﬂux of dB. A way to remove the redundancy is to only allow for non-vanis hing
wµaifµ < µ1whereωa=dxµ1∧dxµ2∧...∧dxµ2kwithµ1< µ2< ... < µ 2k. The number of
suchwµais then the same as the number of 2 k+1 forms.
Sincetheaction isquadraticintheﬁeldstheoscillating mo desdecouplefromthezero-modes
and winding modes and hence we can write:
Z[J] =e2i
(2π)4k+1/integraltext(/tildewiderM−/tildewiderM∗)−1
ABJA(JB−¯JB)Zz.m.[J]Zosc.. (3.14)
8The oscillator modes of BandHare exactly as in [ 25]. Thus, as far as the oscillator modes
are concerned, we can use the results of [ 25] which leads to
Zosc∼/radicalbig
det/tildewiderM′/productdisplay
nµ1
det(2KµaBLνbBnµnν+2LµaALνbB/tildewiderM−1
ABnµnν).(3.15)
The extra factor of/radicalbig
det/tildewiderMinZosc.compared to [ 25] comes from the fact that full integral
overHgives simply 1 but here we have not integrated over the consta nt modes of H. Note
thatZoscalso does not depend on the sources J. In analogy with the chiral Boson case we
denote the regularised version of this expression by2
Zosc.=/radicalbig
det/tildewiderM
η4k+2(/tildewiderM−1
AB). (3.16)
In particular for k= 0 one ﬁnds that η2(/tildewiderM−1) =η(−(1+/tildewiderM−1)/2) where ηis the Dedekind
η-function and /tildewiderM=−(τ+1)/(τ−1) where τis the usual modular parameter of a torus [ 25].
Thus we are left with the zero-modes and winding modes. These contribute

sA˜Zz.m.[sA], (3.28)
in terms of a sum of sectors of ﬁxed H(s)ﬂux. We could substitute qAforsA(3.25) inZz.m.and
ﬁnd a double sum over the combination m+
AandqA. This will result in the same expression for
the partition function that was found in [ 25]. And in particular it was noted there that there
is a symmetry R→1/R. However the approach we want to take here is to restrict to ce rtain
sectors corresponding to choices of H(s)ﬂux.

where the sum is over all possible ﬂuxes of the form ( 2.18). This will again restore duality and
give the result observed in [ 25].
3.4 Self-dual and Generic Radii
Let us now look at the radius R= 1, corresponding to r1=r2= 1. Here the ﬂuxes take the
simple values
1
(2π)2k+1/integraldisplay
ΞAH(s)∈1
2Z, (3.37)
orsA∈1
2Z. This is somewhat degenerate from the discussion above as on e can’t distinguish
between mAandnA. As such the sum over qAin3.24can be shifted to absorb m+
Aand we
obtain

sA
0/bracketrightBigg/parenleftBig
−2l2k+1JA
0|/tildewiderMAB−δAB/parenrightBig
. (3.38)
Recall that sAis either integer or half-integer. The integer parts can be a bsorbed in the sum
overm+
Aand so do not aﬀect the Θ-function but they can aﬀect the phase. F or example both
even and odd sAlead to the same Θ-function but the odd integer cases can come with a minus
sign.
Lastly we mention the case of a generic value of R, whereR4k+2is not rational. Here there
is a unique choice m+
A=mAandqA=nAthat solves the δ-function constraint ( 3.24) and we
12simply ﬁnd
˜Zz.m.[sA] =exp/parenleftBigg

˜sA˜sB(/tildewiderMAB−δAB)−4(l/R)2k+1˜sAJA

.(3.39)
If we consider ﬂuxes of the form ( 3.25) and sum over all mAwithnAﬁxed we’d again ﬁnd
a Θ-function where nA/R4k+2would play the role of characteristics. Similarly if we summ ed
overnAwithmAﬁxed we’d ﬁnd a Θ-function with mAR4k+2playing the role of characteristics.
The duality R→1/Rwould be broken. Summing over both mAandnAwill simply lead to
Zz.m.∼1 as in [25] which of course trivially restores the duality.
3.5 Non-integer Modings
Reference [ 25] introduced a constant 2 k+1 form Ato allow for the ﬂux condition

(2π)2k+1/integraldisplay
ΞA(dB−A)∈R2k+1Z, (3.40)
for some ﬁxed 2 k+1 form A=αµadxµ∧ωa. In this case the winding modes are shifted away
from integers to
wµa=/parenleftbiggR
l/parenrightbigg2k+1
(mµa+αµa). (3.41)
This just corresponds to shifting m+
A→m+

obtained from αµausing the map ( 3.20). However one sees that the Wilson surface operators
are no longer single valued on the torus and have a charge unde r the symmetry ( 2.10):
Wp,Σ(B+ω) =e2πip/integraltext
ΣωWp,Σ(B). (3.42)
In [25], in order to arrive at a Θ-function after summing over all ﬂu xes, an extra topological
term
SA=−1
(2π)2k+1/integraldisplay
A∧dB , (3.43)
was included in the Lagrangian3. The main eﬀect of this term is to remove the α+
Acontribution
that would otherwise appear in the δ-function ( 3.24) so that we still ﬁnd the ﬂuxes are given
by (3.25). Thus the H(s)
Aremain in the form ( 3.27). Repeating the calculation of ˜Z[sA] now
gives, for R4k+2=r1/r2,

13Note that now the conjugate momentum is shifted:
ΠN= (−dB−2H−⋆ηA)
ΠT= (⋆ηdB−⋆ηA), (3.45)
where we have also shifted the topological current to ensure again that H(s)=1
2(ΠT−ΠN).
However from the point of view adopted here we do not need to ad d (3.43). Re-doing the
calculation of ˜Z[sA] without it gives the δ-function constraint ( 3.25)

4 Wilson Surface Correlation Functions
Let us now return to one of the motivations for this work, the c omputation of Wilson surface
correlation functions. To this end we turn oﬀ the source Jand for simplicity we only consider
integer moding. The extension to non-trivial moding should be straightforward.
Our ﬁrst task is to compute a one-point function
/angbracketleftWp,Σ/angbracketright=/integraldisplay
[dB][dH]eip
(2π)2k/integraltext
ΣBeiS. (4.1)
We start by evaluating
1
(2π)2k/integraldisplay
ΣB=l2kbaΣa+l−1R2k+1xµ
⊥mµaΣa+l2k/summationdisplay
bnµaΣaeinµΣxµ
⊥,(4.2)
14where we have introduced
Σa=1
(2π)2k/integraldisplay
Σωa. (4.3)
We also note that by our choice of convention for nµa,xµnµais only non-zero for coordinates
xµ
⊥that are transverse to the cycle Σ.
Thus we ﬁnd three new terms in the action in addition to those s een in the partition
function computation above. The third term couples to the no n-zero modes. However just as
the non-zero mode contributions from the source cancel out i n the path integral over bµain
the computation of the partition function [ 25], these terms also do not contribute to the path
integral when we integrate over bµa. The second term plays a similar role to that of the sources
in the zero-mode calculation above and we will discuss them s hortly.
So let us ﬁrst discuss the ﬁrst term. This comes from a zero-mo debathat didn’t explicitly
enter into the action before. Nevertheless it was there but t he integral over it simply gave an
overall inﬁnite constant δ(0) which we discarded. However now we ﬁnd
/integraldisplay
dbaΣaeil2kpbaΣa=l−2kδ(p). (4.4)
This sets all the Wilson surface one-point functions to zero as expected by momentum conser-
vation.
To continue we can consider a two-point function:
/angbracketleftWp1,Σ1Wp2,Σ2/angbracketright=/integraldisplay
[dB][dH]eip1
(2π)2k/integraltext
Σ1Beip2
(2π)2k/integraltext
Σ2BeiS, (4.5)
where Σ 1and Σ 2are two 2 k-cycles related by translation along a transverse directio n. For
simplicity put the second Wilson Surface at xµ
⊥= 0 and the ﬁrst at xµ
⊥=yµ
⊥. We therefore
ﬁnd
p1

(2π)2k/integraldisplay
Σ2B=l2k(p1+p2)baΣa+p1l−1R2k+1yµ
⊥mµaΣa+oscillators .(4.6)
Again the integrals over the oscillator modes give the same r esult as without Wilson Surfaces.
However the integral over baΣanow sets p1+p2= 0 so in what follows we set p1=−p2=p.
Thus we are left evaluating the sum over winding modes:

The evaluation of the sum over m+

This is somewhat mired by notation, so it is helpful to explic itly examine the case of a chiral

5 Conclusions
In this letter we have explored the role that the ﬂuxes of the u nphysical H(s)ﬁeld play in the
quantum theory of the physical self-dual ﬁeld H(g)in the Sen formulation of self-dual ﬁelds.
We ﬁrst showed that there is an electro-magnetic duality ass ociated to the unphysical potential
Bthat leads to a T-like duality. We then re-derived the partit ion function from a path integral
formulation but where the ﬂuxes of the unphysical H(s)ﬁeld were not integrated over. This
gave us a family of partition functions for the physical ﬁeld H(g)which depend on the choice of
H(s)ﬂux. In particular the zero-mode part of the partition funct ion obtained from a particular
ﬂux sector is given by ( 3.31). For a non-vanishing ﬂux the duality is broken but can be res tored
by summing over pairs of ﬂuxes. We also computed the two-poin t function for Wilson surface
operators and its dependence on the H(s)ﬂux.
This picture is reminiscent of a relative quantum ﬁeld theor y [5,31] where there is not a
unique partition function but rather the partition functio ns take values in the Hilbert space of
an associated quantum ﬁeld theory in one higher dimension. I n our the associated ﬁeld theory
is the free theory of the unphysical H(s)self-dual form. In more well-known approaches the
formulation of a self-dual ﬁeld is obtained from a topologic al Chern-Simons type of action in
174k+ 3 dimensions. It would be interesting to see if the Sen formu lation has a similar origin
(see [9] for a recent discussion of such an approach for other action s).
Although we have only considered the case of a toroidal space time we hope that much of
what we have discussed can carry over to more general spaceti mes. In particular the Wick
rotation of the spacetime metric g, as ﬁrst advocated in [ 25], would appear to work well in any
spacetime, leading to a convergent path-integral despite h aving ﬁelds with a wrong-sign kinetic
term. They simply remain oscillating. With this in mind it wo uld be interesting to gain a
better understanding of global features of the Sen formulat ion on more non-trivial spacetimes.
