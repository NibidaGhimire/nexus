(AMR) strategy to resolve the local gas cooling length, allowing us to gradually increase the resolution in the stellar-feedback-
powered outflows, from ‚â•200 pcto18 pc. The propagation of outflows into the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) is
significantly modified by this additional resolution, but the ISM, star formation and feedback remain by and large the same.
With increasing resolution in the diffuse gas, the hot outflowing phase ( ùëá > 8√ó104K) systematically reaches overall higher
temperatures and stays hotter for longer as it propagates outwards. This leads to two-fold increases in the time-averaged mass
and metal outflow loading factors away from the galaxy ( ùëü=5 kpc), a five-fold increase in the average energy loading factor,
and a‚âà50 per cent increase in the number of sightlines with ùëÅOvi‚â•1013cm‚àí2. Such a significant boost to the energetics of
outflows without new feedback mechanisms or channels strongly motivates future studies quantifying the efficiency with which
better-resolved multiphase outflows regulate galactic star formation in a cosmological context.

1 INTRODUCTION
Multiphase galactic outflows are ubiquitous across the galaxy pop-
ulation, with their range of molecular, cold, ionized and hot phases

provide a fundamental mechanism to regulate the star formation of
galaxies across cosmic time. But a detailed understanding of how
galactic outflows launch, how they propagate through the ISM and
howtheyinteractwiththeCGMremainselusive,andakeychallenge

Low-mass dwarf galaxies provide valuable clues to address these

pernovae (SNe) explosions provide an important engine to inject
energy and momentum into the ISM and launch powerful galactic
windscapableofescapingsuchlow-masssystems(e.g.Chevalier&
Clegg 1985; Dekel & Silk 1986; Murray et al. 2005). Despite this

haviouroflow-massgalaxies(e.g.Emericketal.2020;Agertzetal.
2020; Smith et al. 2021; Fichtner et al. 2022). Moreover, for a given
feedback model, the spatial distribution of the energy injection and
the clustering in space and time of SNe plays a major role in the
ability to build a powerful outflow (e.g. Girichidis et al. 2016; Kim
et al. 2017; Fielding et al. 2018; Ohlin et al. 2019), making outflow
propertiesstronglysensitivetotheunderlyingmodelforwhereyoung
stars form and spatially distribute (e.g. Andersson et al. 2020, 2023;
Steinwandeletal.2023).Further,theamountoffeedbackenergyand
momentum available from stellar evolution at the low metallicities
ofdwarfgalaxiesremainsdebated,makingthetotalfeedbackbudget
itself an important uncertainty in such systems (e.g. Gutcke et al.
2021; Prgomet et al. 2022). All these factors contribute to the large
spectrum of outflow energetics reported in the literature, with the
predicted efficiency with which outflows carry mass and energy out
of dwarf galaxies spreading over orders of magnitudes at a given
stellar mass (see e.g. Muratov et al. 2015; Hu 2019; Emerick et al.
2020; Smith et al. 2021; Pandya et al. 2021; Andersson et al. 2023;
Steinwandel et al. 2024 for recent studies).
Observational constraints are thus instrumental to help pinpoint
the energetics of galactic outflows in low-mass galaxies, but the
multiphase nature of such outflows makes this a challenging task.
The different cold, warm and hot gas phases are probed through a
diversityofobservationaltechniques,eachwiththeirownwavelength
window and challenges (see Collins & Read 2022 for a review).
Moreover, there is no consensus as to the respective importance
of each phase in regulating star formation. The cold-to-warm phase

2019) and much lower values (Marasco et al. 2023). Alternatively,
the hot outflow phase ( ‚â•105K) is expected to dominate the energy
budget, which could be key to pressurize the surrounding CGM
and prevent further star formation by delaying gas inflows onto the
galaxy(e.g.Hu2019;Li&Bryan2020;Carretal.2023).However,
this phase is challenging to observe, emitting X-rays that are only
accessible for limited samples of low-mass dwarfs (e.g. Heckman
et al. 1995; Summers et al. 2003, 2004; Ott et al. 2005; McQuinn
et al. 2018). This makes obtaining a holistic overview of outflow
thermodynamics difficult observationally, and robust predictions of
the multiphase structure of outflows paramount theoretically.
Beyond the launching mechanics of the wind and its initial struc-
ture within the ISM, a key aspect to achieving accurate predictions
is to robustly capture the propagation of the multiphase outflow as

Giguere & Oh 2023 for a review). The relative efficiency of each of
theseprocessesremainsdebatedastheydependonthelocalgasand
radiation conditions, but they introduce characteristic length scales
that should be resolved to accurately capture how the original struc-

A key common feature for these processes, however, is that their
characteristic length-scales are invariably small ( ‚â™10 pc), posing a
huge numerical challenge to simulations that wish to model entire
galaxies (‚â•kpc).
This issue is further compounded by the Lagrangian behaviour
of most galaxy simulations, focussing the computational effort and
resolution where gas is dense (i.e. in the ISM) but quickly degrad-
ing it in the diffuse gas to speed up the computation. Density and

tiphase structure of simulated galactic outflows is thus likely to be
under-resolved and numerically suppressed, reminiscent of the nu-
merical limitations in modelling the larger-scale diffuse CGM (e.g.
Peeplesetal.2019;Hummelsetal.2019;Sureshetal.2019;vande
Voort et al. 2019). These challenges have motivated subgrid imple-
mentations and new hydrodynamical methods to model multiphase

2023;Smithetal.2024),butadetailedunderstandingofhowtheen-ergetics and observables of outflows depend on resolution remains
lacking.
Furthermore, outflows are highly dynamic in nature, propagating
at high velocities ( ‚™Ü100kms‚àí1) into highly stratified media where

radiative transfer effects in outflows).
To gain a better understanding of the importance of these physi-
calprocesses,wecreateanewsuiteofgalaxy-formationsimulations
aimed to provide a more robust modelling of galactic outflows. We
perform isolated radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of a dwarf
galaxy with the AMR code ramses-rtz (Katz 2022). This allows
us to (i) obtain an accurate account of non-equilibrium effects by
solving the non-equilibrium chemistry of ‚â•60 ionic species cou-
pled on-the-fly with the spatially- and time-varying radiation field,
while (ii) following the development of galaxy-scale outflows self-
consistently powered by stellar feedback within the disc. We further
complement this setup by implementing a new AMR refinement
strategy in ramses-rtz that explicitly aims to resolve the local gas
coolinglength(seealsoSimonsetal.2020forasimilarapproachin

2 NUMERICAL SETUP
We present a suite of radiative hydrodynamical simulations of iso-
lated galaxies, all performed with the same physical modelling but
gradually increasing off-the-plane spatial resolution to resolve ther-
mal instabilities in the diffuse outflowing gas. We summarize our
numerical galaxy formation model in Section 2.1, in particular how
we account for non-equilibrium, ion-by-ion cooling coupled to on-
the-flyradiativetransfer(seeKatz2022foramoreextensivedescrip-
tion of the same setup). Section 2.2 presents the implementation of
the new refinement strategy targeting the gas cooling length and
Section 2.3 the specific galaxy and simulations of this work.
2.1 Chemistry, cooling and galaxy formation physics
We perform radiative hydrodynamical numerical simulations using
the adaptive-mesh refinement code ramses-rtz (Katz 2022), built
uponthe ramsesandramses-rt software(Teyssier2002;Rosdahl&
Teyssier 2015). We solve the gas dynamics using a HLLC Riemann

vertical structure (top left) which under-resolves the off-the-plane cooling length (Figure 1), transitioning quickly from the ISM resolution ( 18 pc, deep blue)
to‚â•100 pc(white). By contrast, resolution with our new scheme targeting the cooling length naturally tracks the interfaces of expanding superbubbles off the
disc plane, following their irregular spatial structure and preventing them from numerically over-mixing. The structure of the dense ISM (bottom, deep blue)
only gets visually modified when the additional refinement in the diffuse gas reaches a maximal resolution equal to that in the ISM (right-most). Nonetheless,
star-formation conditions between all runs remain consistent with the fiducial setup, even for our most resolved cases (Appendix A).

account for non-equilibrium atomic cooling processes of H and He
(Rosdahletal.2013)andmolecularcoolingof H2(Katzetal.2017).
This thermodynamical setup is complemented by an extensive
galaxy formation model, including star formation and stellar feed-
back processes. Stars form in a molecular-cloud-like environment
identified using a thermo-turbulent star-formation criterion (Feder-
rath & Klessen 2012; Kimm et al. 2017) and with a Kroupa (2001)
initial mass function. Star particles are spawned with minimum ini-
tialmassesof 1830M‚äô.Stellarparticlesthenre-injectenergy,mass,
momentum, metals and radiation locally, following the mechanical
feedbackprescriptionofKimmet al.(2015)forSNeexplosionsand
the model of Agertz et al. (2013) for stellar winds. Radiation is in-
jected in gas cells surrounding stellar particles assuming a single
stellar population of the age and metallicity of the particle and aBPASSv2.2.1spectralenergydistribution(Stanwayetal.2016).The
radiation impacts the gas via photo-ionization, radiation pressure,
and photo-heating. These simulations model photo-electric and H2

2.2 Refinement strategy on the gas cooling length
All our adaptive-mesh simulations start by using a traditional ‚Äòfidu-
cial‚Äô quasi-Lagrangian refinement strategy targeting the ISM. To
achievethis,wesplitAMRcellswhentheirdarkmatterplusbaryonic
massexceeds8,000M ‚äôfor13levelsina 150 kpcbox,corresponding
to a maximum spatial resolution of 18pc. We also split cells when
the local Jeans‚Äô length is resolved by less than four cells to obtain a
morehomogeneousspatialresolutionacrosstheISM.Thisallowsus
to better capture ISM turbulence (e.g. Federrath et al. 2011) rather
than solely focussing on dense clumps.
Figure2illustratesthestructureofthisfiducialrefinementstrategy
(left-most column), showing an edge-on (top) and face-on (bottom)
map of the spatial resolution at a time of comparable outflow rates
between the simulations ( ùë°=540 Myr,‚âà0.05M‚äôyr‚àí1). With the
quasi-Lagrangianapproach,resolutionisnearitsallowedmaximum
within the disc ( 18 pc, deep blue) but drops rapidly in the vertical
direction (‚â•100 pc, white) as the density decreases.
However, the cooling length of gas escaping the galaxy can be
much smaller and is either marginally or under-resolved by the
quickly degrading resolution (Figure 1). To remedy to this issue, we
store the net cooling rate Œõnetobtained at each simulation timestep
by the non-equilibrium solver and compute

structureofthegalacticdisc(bottom)anditsdenseISM(deepblue)
where star-formation occurs is visually similar in all cases, until
we reach a cooling length refinement matching the maximal ISM
resolution (right-most column). Even in this case however, we show
in Appendix A that our new refinement scheme adds resolution in
the diffuse gas around the disc, but does not impact the location and
densities at which star formation occur and supernovae explode.
Rather, targeting ùëôcoolintroduces large amount of additional off-
the-disc-plane resolution that tracks discrete plumes and shells of
outflowing gas as they expand and mix with the inner CGM (top

Since the ISM is already at the maximum resolution due to the
quasi-Lagrangianscheme,theadditionalrefinementcriteriononthe
cooling length allows us to allocate additional resources to the dif-
fuse gas in a controlled and gradual way. This provides us with the
ability to cleanly and conveniently decouple the resolution between
denseand diffusegas,and toisolate theirrelativeimpact onoutflow
properties in Section 3.
Furthermore, we also verified that the resolution structure signif-
icantly varies with time and naturally follows to the star formation
and outflow activity of the galaxy. This provides us with an effi-

the cooling length of the diffuse gas (left to right) yields a visibly more structured outflow, better capturing the density and temperature contrasts between the
hot, volume-filling cavities after shocks and the thin, dense shells of expanding material. At this time, velocity streamlines (bottom, black arrows) are also
increasingly open, indicating a faster moving and more energetic outflow. Geometrical interfaces through which we quantify outflow energetics are visualized

different random seeds (first and third lines) to assess stochasticity in our
results (Appendix B). We also provide a controlled, time-limited test of the
computational cost of each setup (third column) discussed in Section 5.1.

up within 15 per cent of each other. This is key to compare their
outflows, as it guarantees that the overall energy, momentum and
metal budget from stellar feedback is nearly unchanged between
different resolution runs. It also provides further evidence that the
physics of star formation in our simulations is not affected by the
additional resolution in the diffuse gas (Appendix A).
However,theabilitytodrivegalacticoutflowsalsodependsonthe
coupling between feedback and the surrounding gas, which in turn
depends on the clustering of SNe and the density of the medium
in which they explode. This is subject to stochasticity due to the
probabilistic nature of our modelling of star formation (see Genel
et al. 2019; Keller et al. 2019 for further discussion). To quantify
the magnitude of this scatter, we perform three simulations of our
reference galaxy and three with the cooling length resolved downto 36 pc, solely varying the random seed for star formation in each
of them. We show in Appendix A that star formation and feedback
conditions within the ISM are comparable between both stochastic

in resolution, all runs have similar total masses of outflowing gas
(varying by less than 20 per cent, top of each panel in Figure 6),
ensuring that changes in the PDFs are largely unaffected by changes
in overall normalizations.
Starting from the one-dimensional distributions for our fiducial
case (Figure 5, purple), we see that the majority of the outflowing

peratures(‚àº104K),asexpectedfromdiffusegasinphoto-ionization

fraction of the gas is dense enough to self-shield efficiently against
the UV background ( ùúå‚â•10‚àí1ùëöpcm‚àí3in our model) and cool
below 104K. SN-heated gas is also visible as a long tail towards
high temperatures ( ‚â•105K), while the enhancement of gas with
ùëá‚âà8√ó104Kmaps to a local minimum of the cooling function at
thelowmetallicitiesconsideredinthiswork( ‚â§0.3Z‚äô;e.g.Bialy&

Improvingthenumericaltreatmentofthermalinstabilities(purple

tematic trends for the tails of these distributions. The high-density
and low-temperature tails incrementally reach higher densities and
lower temperatures, confirming the expectation that condensation
and cooling in the diffuse gas are numerically suppressed in our
fiducial setup (Figure 1). However, the improving resolution also
generatesalongertailtowardshighertemperaturesandlowerdensi-

With increasing resolution (towards the right), the low-density

This low-density gas also has a visibly cooler tail (top right), which

increasing resolution yields a better-sampled diffuse phase with an increased scatter in temperatures and pressures at a given density, and allows denser and
colder gas at high densities. This increasingly multiphase structure in turn affects how the thermo-kinematics of outflows as they propagate from close to the

Section to gain better insights into these aspects.
Before turning to this, we briefly highlight that the one- or two-

increasing resolution and that the ordering of simulations with res-
olution is not linear (e.g. blue versus green in Figure 5). This hints
that, despite improving the situation, we are yet to fully resolve the
multiphase structure of the outflowing gas and that evolution at a
given resolution possesses stochasticity due to the specific star for-

Again,eachpanelshowsthenormalizedstackoverthetimeevolution

From Figure 7, we recover that most of the mass-weighted out-flow gas (top panels) is warm ( ‚âà104K), travelling at relatively low
velocities (ùë£ùëß‚â§10kms‚àí1) and is unlikely to escape the gravita-
tional potential of the galaxy ( ùë£circas grey dotted line). This picture
remains qualitatively similar as the cooling length is increasingly
resolved (left to right), although the improved resolution leads to a
tail of‚â§104ùêægas (top, left panel). This confirms that, close to the
disc,theejectionofmassbySNe-drivenoutflowsisnotsignificantly

Instarkcontrast,theimprovednumericaltreatmentofthehotphase

same histograms by gas specific energy (bottom panels). Focussing
first on the fiducial case (left), the hot, fast-moving and energy-
carrying gas phase of the outflow materializes as a track extending
towards high temperatures and velocities, broadly following an iso-
Mach slope (dashed lines, where M=ùë£/ùëêùë†withùëêùë†=‚àöÔ∏Å

energy(solidlineshowstheequalitybetweengaskineticandinternal

Asweincreasinglyresolvethecoolinglengthindiffusegas(leftto

the hot gas and its subsequent energetics as it escapes into the CGM (Figure 8).

of the thermo-kinematics of the gas significantly boosts its energetics, with outflow mass systematically travelling at faster velocities (top panels) and a more

Atùëü=5 kpc, the mass-weighted outflow (Figure 8, top panels) is
hotter and faster moving than at ùëß=1 kpc, as expected if the gas is
acceleratingasitescapesthegalaxy.Furthermore,marginalizingthe
mass-weighteddiagramsofFigure7and8alongthey-axis,wethen
compute the mass-weighted velocity PDF. We find that both these
PDFs shifts towards larger velocities with increasing resolution, but
the increase is relatively mild at ùëß=1 kpc(medians going from
6.7 to 8.5 to 8.5 to 9.2 kms‚àí1with each added resolution level,
respectively) and more significant at 5 kpc(going from 39.9 to 63.4
to46.5to50.3kms‚àí1).Inallcases,theoutflowinggassignificantly
accelerates between ùëß=1 kpcandùëü=5 kpc, but this acceleration is
amplified with higher resolution outflows.
Weighting the outflow by energy confirms this picture (bottom
panels in Figure 8). Even after propagating to ùëü=5 kpc, the hot
phase remains better resolved with our improved scheme, extending
towards hotter temperatures and faster velocities as expected from
better capturing hot-to-warm interfaces (see e.g. Kim & Ostriker
2018 for a discussion). At our highest resolution (right column), we
even recover a small hot, subsonic component (although much less
prominent than at ùëß=1 kpc) that is entirely absent with the fiducial

this results in significant boosts to the outflow loading factors with

3.3 Consequences on outflow loading factors
We now turn to quantifying the impact of the improved numerical
treatment of the outflowing gas on its loading factors. We compute,
at each saved simulated time, the mass, energy and metal loading

other radial definitions (see Appendix D).

Outflows close to the disc (left panels) are significantly mass and
metal loaded ( ùúÇùëÄ,ùúÇùëç‚â•1) but not energy loaded ( ùúÇùê∏‚â™1). En-
hancing off-the-disc-plane resolution leads to a mild but systematic
evolution,witha50percentenhancementinthemedianmassload-
ing factor between the fiducial and the most resolved case, a factor
of two growth in the energy loading factor, and a 20 per cent in-
creaseinthemedianmetalloadingfactor.Theselimitedincreasesin
massandmetalloadingareconsistentwiththerelativelyunchanged
mass-weighted PDF in Figure 7 (top panels), while the increase in
energy loading factor is consistent with the hotter hot phase and
bettercapturedtransitionofthesonic-to-subsonictransitioncloseto
the disc (Figure 7, bottom panels). However, except for the energy
loading factor, the significance of these increases remains difficult
to interpret, as stochasticity due to varying star formation activity
at different times (black lines show the 16-84 confidence intervals)
as well as the overall noise in the evolution of a numerical setup
at a given resolution (Appendix B) can generate shifts of a similar
magnitude.
In contrast, differences further away from the galaxy (right pan-
els) are far more significant, with a two-fold increase in mass load-
ing (median ùúÇùëÄ=0.20,0.34,0.43,0.47from purple to green)
and metal loading factors (median ùúÇùëç=0.46,0.72,0.84,0.98),
and a five-fold increase in energy loading factor (median ùúÇùê∏=
0.0034,0.0085,0.0090,0.017). Importantly, these shifts with en-
hanced resolution are close to exceeding the 16-84 confidence in-
terval span of the fiducial case and are robust against run-to-run
stochasticity (Appendix B).
Our study shows that better resolving the diffuse outflowing gas
provides a significant boost to their energetics and, in turn, to their
ability to regulate galactic star formation. When escaping into the

The full reach of these results remains to be determined in a
cosmological context, however. Our outflows currently propagate
in a low-density, static hot halo surrounding our idealized dwarf
galaxy, rather than the layered, dynamic and inflowing CGM of a
cosmologicalgalaxy.However, theirsignificancestronglymotivates
future studies quantifying how the gas cycle of galaxies is affected
when outflows and inflows are better resolved.

and compute histograms of line-of-sight column densities for each
ion. We then aggregate the histograms over time, renormalize them
to obtain the stacked probability distribution functions, and take the
cumulative sums shown in Figure 10.
Starting from low-ionization ions (left panel), we observe

This is primarily driven by an increase at high column densities
(e.g.ùëì(ùëÅHi‚â•1018cm‚àí2)increases by 15 per cent), which is best
explained by the growth of a colder and denser gas phase as the
out-of-the-plane cooling length is better resolved (Figure 6). The
relatively limited evolution in the covering fractions of these low-
ionization ions with resolution is encouraging, although the lack of
convergencehighlightsthatwearenotyetresolvingthecharacteristic

mild evolution until a sudden increase in the covering fraction oc-

to stochasticity in the given realization of the star formation and
outflow history. For example, our two other realizations of the out-

ùëì(ùëÅOvi‚â•1013cm‚àí2)compared to our fiducial simulation, while
our other two random realizations of the fiducial setup vary by as

that runs with improved treatment of thermal instabilities in the dif-
fuse gas always have elevated covering fractions of O viand O vii.

5 DISCUSSION
5.1 The numerical cost of refining on the cooling length
Toestablishthatbetterresolvingthemultiphasestructureofgalactic
outflows boosts their energetics, we rely on adding resolution in the
diffuse thermally-unstable gas. This carries an associated numerical
cost that potentially limits the practical scope of our approach and
theapplicabilityofourrefinementstrategy.Wediscussinthissection
the cost of refining on the cooling length and strategies we envision
to mitigate it.
Simulations in our main suite were performed with a different
numberofcoresacrossdifferentmachines.Theirtotalcoststhusmix
the increased computational load with different intrinsic hardware
and parallel efficiencies, making a direct comparison difficult. To
provide a cleaner test, we start from our most refined setup at the
time shown in Figure 1 and 2 ( ùë°=540 Myr; i.e. neither particularly
quiescentnoroutflowing)andrestartfourrunsfor6wall-timehours
on 768 cores of the same machine, gradually degrading the cooling
length refinement target to 36 pc, 72 pc, and none. Table 1 (right
column) reports the median timestep cost (in CPU wall-clock time
per simulated Myr) for each of these tests, which we stress can not
be extrapolated to estimate the total simulation cost as the timestep
strongly varies depending on the outflowing conditions.

the ISM resolution at 18 pc.
This non-linear increase reflects the fact that the computational
effort is dominated by the densest, most refined cells that have more
restrictive Courant‚ÄìFriedrichs‚ÄìLewy conditions and higher conver-
gence costs for the chemistry and radiative transfer solvers. In other
words, intermediate setups resolving the diffuse gas twice or four
times worse thanthe ISM are not free, buttheir computational costs
can be kept under control as adding many coarser cells remains a
sub-dominant cost compared to computations in the fine ISM gas
cells. Given the already large gains in outflow loading factors we
observe at 72 and 36 pc (Figure 9), we foresee these intermediate
setups as the most attractive and tractable options for cosmological
setups.
In fact, cosmological simulations of galaxies with such an AMR
strategy refining on the cooling length have already been achieved
(Simons et al. 2020; Lochhaas et al. 2021, 2023), although at a
comparativelymuchlowerspatialresolutioninboththeISMandthe
coolinglength(‚âà200 pc)thanhere.Thislowerresolutionarisesfrom
targeting larger galaxies than the dwarf considered here, and from
fundamental differences betweenthe isolated setup of thiswork and
a live cosmological environment. The presence of dense filaments
and inflows, of merging galaxies with their stripped tails of gas,
and of an already multiphase and turbulent CGM surrounding the
central galaxy all add gas highly susceptible to thermal instabilities.
This would likely trigger large amounts of additional refinement
and sharply increase the computational and memory costs of the
simulation.
Although field-testing is required to pinpoint the achievable
cooling-lengthresolutioninagivencosmologicalsetupwith ramses-
rtz, we remain confident of its overall tractability due to the over-
whelmingly dominant cost of the ISM gas. Furthermore, reducing
the computational expense is possible by relaxing our requirement
that the cooling length is resolved by at least ùëÅcells=8, although
further exploration is needed to understand the convergence proper-
tiesofoursimulationswith ùëÅcells.Anothermitigationstrategycould
also be to release additional resolution levels gradually over cosmic
time for the cooling length as is often done for the ISM (e.g. Snaith

5.2 Numerical uncertainties in resolving the multiphase
structure of galactic outflows
Our results show that incrementally increasing resolution in the dif-
fuse,outflowinggasboostsboththemassandenergyloadingfactors
of outflows as they escape the galaxy. In Section 3, we tie this to a
better-resolved multiphase structure. In this Section, we discuss the
physical and numerical mechanisms responsible for this effect, and
the remaining uncertainties associated with modelling the hydrody-
namics of galactic outflows.
Multiple physical processes are responsible for setting the multi-
phase structure of gas on small scales, ranging from shocks, hydro-
dynamicalinstabilitiesandcoolingandheatingprocesses(Section1
andFaucher-Giguere&Oh2023forareview).Theprimarytargetof
this study is to better capture the poorly-resolved cooling length in
the diffuse gas (Figure 1). This can lead to an artificial suppression
of multiphase structures (e.g. discussion in Hummels et al. 2019).
We tackle the issue using the refinement strategy described in Sec-tion 2.2, but a direct consequence of increasing resolution in the
diffuse gas is to also help mitigate other numerical effects.
In particular, numerical diffusion of hydrodynamical quantities
due to the advection of a fluid in motion with respect to a fixed grid
(e.g.Robertsonetal.2010;Teyssier2015)isparticularlyimportantin
the context of fast outflowing gas ( ‚â•100kms‚àí1). Advection errors
are demonstrably reduced with increasing resolution, and our most
resolvedsimulationswouldthussufferlessfromadvection-drivennu-
merical mixing between gas phases. Similarly, the heating, lifetime
and propagation of shocks are also better captured with increasing
resolution(e.g.Skillmanetal.2008;Creaseyetal.2011;Vazzaetal.
2011) and typically under-resolved in the diffuse gas (e.g. Bennett
& Sƒ≥acki 2020). A better treatment of shocks then comes as a by-
product of refining on the cooling length (e.g. Figure 4), improving
their ability to thermalize gas at higher temperatures in the lowest
densityregionswhicharebettersampled.Furthermore,resolvingthe
transitionbetweensubsonicandsupersonicgasintheoutflowiskey
toaccuratelycapturetheaccelerationofthehotphase(e.g.Chevalier
& Clegg 1985; Fielding & Bryan 2022). This can be under-resolved
with traditional schemes (Smith et al. 2024), and is improved in our
moreresolvedruns(Figure7).Lastly,hydrodynamicalturbulenceis
heavilysuppressedbyinsufficientresolution,andsetsthecharacteris-
ticgrowthtimescalesofthecoldphase(Gronke&Oh2018;Tanetal.
2021;Gronkeetal.2022).Thetraditionalquasi-Lagrangianstrategy
erases small-scale information in the diffuse gas and likely under-
estimates the amount of gas turbulence (see also Bennett & Sƒ≥acki
2020).Theaddedresolutionvisiblyimprovesthelevelofturbulence
in the outflowing gas (e.g. in this movie), despite our refinement
strategy still suppressing turbulence due to refinement/derefinement
noise (Teyssier 2015, see also Martin-Alvarez et al. 2022 for other
strategies to mitigate this issue in a galaxy formation context).
Pinpointing the respective importance of each of these coupled
numericaleffectsremainsdifficultinourcurrentsetup.Disentangling
themcouldbepossiblebyimplementingcomplementaryrefinement
strategies that target one effect at a time (e.g. shock refinement;
Bennett & Sƒ≥acki 2020) and are used in turn. But we stress that
the numerical gains associated with targeting the cooling length of
thediffusegasaremultifold,andextendwellbeyondbetter-captured
thermal instabilities.
Despitethesegainshowever,oursimulationsdonotexhibitsignsof
numericalconvergenceingastemperature,densityorvelocityPDFs
(Figures 6 and 8), highlighting that we are still under-resolving rel-
evant physical processes. This should be expected as resolving their
characteristic length scales of each individual microscopic process
is required to obtain numerically-converged results and can require
sub-pc resolution in the diffuse gas (e.g. Koyama & Inutsuka 2004;
Kim&Kim2013).However,theinteractionofmanyprocesses,each
withtheirownpreferredregimeandcharacteristicscales,somewhat
blurs this picture, and quantities integrated across the plasma might
convergewithouteverresolvingmicroscopicscales(Tanetal.2021).
In fact, despite the clear growth of outflow loading factors at
5 kpc with increasing resolution (Figure 9), this growth slows as
the resolution keeps improving. This hints that convergence in such
integrated quantities could be achieved, in particular in a statistical
sense,giventhestochasticityassociatedwithstarformationactivity.
More quantitative statements, however, require a wider exploration
of numerical resolutions and models.

6 CONCLUSION
We perform radiative-hydrodynamical numerical simulations of an
isolateddwarfgalaxy,improvingthethermodynamicalmodellingof
the outflowing gas escaping the galaxy. Each simulation drives self-
consistent galactic outflows from SNe and photo-ionization feed-
back within the ISM resolved at 18 pc, and accounts for the non-
equilibrium chemistry and cooling of gas coupled to the radiative
transfer using the AMR ramses-rtz code (Katz 2022).
To remedy the under-resolved cooling length in the diffuse out-
flow when using a traditional quasi-Lagrangian refinement strategy
(Figure 1), we implement a new refinement strategy in ramses-rtz
targeting the local gas cooling length computed on-the-fly from the
non-equilibrium, line-by-line cooling rate. We then perform addi-
tional simulations of our dwarf galaxy incrementally resolving the
cooling length down to 72, 36 and 18 pc.
Theadditionalrefinementcriteriononthecoolinglengthimproves
the resolution in the diffuse out-of-the-galaxy-plane gas (Figure 2),
without significantly modifying the average star formation rate, the
amount of stellar mass formed (Figure 3), or the star formation and
supernovafeedbackconditionsinthedense,ISMgas(AppendixA).
This provides us with a controlled study, where the launching me-
chanics of the outflows within the galaxy are comparable but their
propagation as they escape the galaxy is better resolved.
With increasing resolution, outflows become increasingly multi-
phase,exhibitingboth asystematicallyhigherfraction ofcolderand
densergas,andamorediffusephasefeaturinganincreasedscatterin

keytransitionbetweensupersonicandsubsonicgas(Figure7).These
improvementsclosetothediscthenextendtoincreasedenergeticsat
larger radii, with the hot phase staying systematically hotter at large
radii (Figure 8).
Over‚âà500 Myr of evolution, the combination of these factors
leads to a five-fold increase in the average energy loading factor of
the galaxy, and two-fold increases in the average mass and metal
loading factors in the inner CGM ( ùëü=5 kpc, Figure 9). These
boosts occur without modifications to the internal feedback bud-
get or modelling and are robust to stochastic realizations of the star
formation history (Appendix B). Rather, they stem from better re-
solving the hydrodynamical and thermodynamical processes as the
outflow propagates into the CGM (Section 5.2). The significance of
this boost in outflow energetics without new feedback mechanisms
strongly motivates future studies extending the analysis to a cos-
mological context. Quantifying how such outflows interact with a
self-consistent, already-multiphase cosmological CGM, rather thanthe isolated hot halo of this study, will be key to understanding their
improvedefficiencyatregulatinggalacticstarformationovercosmic
time.
Furthermore, a key novelty of our simulations is to track the non-
equilibriumabundancesof ‚â•60ions,allowingustorobustlycapture
the ionic structure of the diffuse gas (Figure 10). Covering fraction
of low-ionization ions (e.g. H i) exhibit a limited increase, primarily
drivenbyamoreprominentdenseandcolderphasebetter(e.g. ùëÅHi‚â•

andùëÅOvii‚â•1013cm‚àí2increasing by‚âà50per cent between our
extreme resolutions.
Our results demonstrate the importance of additional resolution
in the diffuse gas to capture the ionic structure of outflows, and in-
terprettheirobservablesignaturesinemissionandabsorption.Ded-
icated companion papers building upon the improved treatment of
outflows presented here will quantify the robustness of inferences
ofoutflowpropertiesfromobservationaldiagnoses(seealsothisat-
tached movie). In particular, we will post-process our simulations
withresonant-lineradiativetransferusingthe rascascode(Michel-
Dansac et al. 2020) to obtain mock Mg ii, Siiiand Fe iispectra of
our outflows. This will allow us to assess the accuracy with which
such observations (e.g. Rupke et al. 2005; Martin & Bouch√© 2009;
Rubinetal.2011;Martinetal.2013)canrecoveroutflowproperties
and loading factors (H. Katz et al. in prep). We also plan to use our
simulationstoassesspotentialbiasesinrecoveringspatially-resolved

A. Cameron et al. in prep).
Finally, thermally-unstable and multiphase gas are common fea-
tures across galaxy formation and astrophysics. The approach pre-
sented in this study provides a highly modular AMR strategy to
better resolve the cooling length of the diffuse gas, with a compu-
tational cost that can be adapted to galaxy formation applications

APPENDIX A: STAR FORMATION STATISTICS
We check in this Appendix that the star formation properties of our
simulationsareunaffectedbytheadditionalrefinementschemeonthe
coolinglength,ensuringthatthestellardistributionanditsassociated
feedback are consistent between runs.
Figure3showsthatthetotalamountofstarsformedoverthecourse
ofthesimulationissimilartowithin15percentbetweenrunsatdif-
ferentresolutions.Wealsocheckedthatthestochasticre-simulations
atthesameresolutionpresentedinAppendixBverifythiscondition
as well. This guarantees that the total, integrated feedback budget
over the evolution of our galaxies is largely unchanged, but not that
its instantaneous coupling and efficiency is unaffected.
Aformalquantificationofthiswouldrequirestoringtheproperties
ofeachindividualSNtoobtaintheirthree-dimensionalclusteringand
explosion conditions (e.g. Smith et al. 2021), but this information is
unfortunatelynotrecordedbyourmainsimulations.Instead,wesave
thegasdensityandgalacticsphericalradiusatwhichstellarparticles
areborn,providingausefulproxyforthedistributionofyoungstars
that are the main feedback contributors. We show their distributions
in Figure A1.
Firstcomparingrunswithanincreasinglyresolvedcoolinglength
(top panels), we observe significant differences between their gas
densityandradiidistributionsofstellarparticlesatbirth.Wecompute
the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance from the
referencedistribution(‚ÄòISM18pc‚Äô)andfind(0.06,0.10,0.08)forthe
densitydistributionsand(0.09,0.10,0.09)forthegalacticradii.Such
statistics would be enough to reject that the two samples are drawn
from the same underlying distribution at high confidence (p-values
<10‚àí7).
This rejection, however, likely arises from the large sample size
(‚âà10,000) affecting the KS test, rather than from intrinsic dif-
ferences. In fact, the level of variations between distributions with
differentcoolinglengthsiscomparableorsmallertorun-to-runscat-
ter at a fixed numerical setup (middle and bottom rows). In these
cases, we respectively find KS distances of (0.07, 0.09) and (0.04,
0.06) between distribution of gas densities, and (0.06, 0.04) and
(0.06, 0.10) between distributions of radii. We also verified that the
Wassersteindistancesbetweendistributions,whicharelesssensitive
toextremavalues,arecomparablebetweenstochasticre-simulations
and different resolution runs.
We thus conclude that introducing additional refinement on the
coolinglengthdoesnotimpactthestarformationwithinourgalaxies
further than natural stochasticity, with star formation proceeding at

have been expected since we minimally modify the AMR structure
ofthedensediscwherestarformationoccurs.Evenwhenadditional
resolutionisvisibleinthegalacticplaneclosetotheISMresolution
(Figure 2, right-most), such gas is diffuse and thermally-unstable
rather than dense and star-forming, and is being better resolved due
to its small cooling length. Our star formation criterion based on
convergent flows ensures that star formation proceeds in a similar
rangeofdensitiesandradiiinthiscase(green)thanintheotherruns.

in these distributions are minimal, giving strong confidence that the

than differences in initial energetics, the results in Section 3 stem
from better resolving the propagation of the outflow into the CGM.
APPENDIX B: SENSITIVITY OF OUR RESULTS TO
STOCHASTICITY
Although all simulations in the main suite form a similar amount of
stars overall (Figure 3), their instantaneous star formation rate and
their ability to drive powerful outflows at a given time also depends
onmorestochasticparameters,suchastheinstantaneousISMcondi-
tionsandclusteringofSNe.InthisAppendix,weperformadditional
simulationstounderstandthelevelofvariancefromdifferentstarfor-
mation realizations, and confirm that results in Section 3 are robust
to this stochasticity.
Tothisend,wefirstsimulatethebasefiducialsetup(i.e.onlywith
thequasi-Lagrangianrefinementscheme)threetimes,changingonly
the random seed of star formation to obtain a different evolution at
fixed physical setup. We then repeat this exercise with refinement
on the cooling length down to 36 pc. Figure B1 then compares their
distributionofstarformationrates(toppanels),massandenergyout-
flowratesat1kpc(middlerows),andmassandenergyoutflowrates
at5kpc(bottomrows)asdefinedinSection3.3.AsinSection3.3,we
removeinflowsfromthepresentedstatisticswhichonlyoccurforthe
fiducial setups, making trends when comparing to higher resolution
runs more conservative.
Focussing first on each suite of three re-simulations (middle and
right columns), we observe visible shifts in the median star forma-
tion, mass and energy outflow rates that confirm the presence of
stochasticity at fixed numerical setup. Nonetheless, star formation
rates have well overlapping 16-84 confidence intervals (black lines)
both within each individual suite (top middle or top right), across
the two stochastic re-simulation suites (top middle and right), and
across the resolution study (top left). This further supports that star
formation is regulated similarly across all simulations (see also Ap-
pendix A).
Mass and energy outflow rates close to the disc ( |ùëß|=1 kpc;
second and third row) are also very stable against stochasticity, with
bothre-simulationssuites(middlepanels,middleandrightcolumns)
displaying strongly overlapping 16-84 confidence intervals that also
overlap with the resolution study (middle, left).
Awayfromthedisc( ùëü=5 kpc,bottomrows),massandenergyout-
flow rates show larger differences between stochastic re-simulations
(yellowandred),whetherinthefiducialcaseorwhenrefiningonthe
coolinglength(middleandrightcolumns,respectively).Wealsonote
that higher average star formation rates (e.g. top, yellow) does not
necessarily translate to more vigorous outflows on average (bottom,
yellow), reflecting the complexity of sustaining galactic winds. De-
spitetheselargershifts,thestochasticityprobedinourfiducialsetup
(middle column) is incapable of reproducing the sharp increase in
outflowloadingfactorsat5kpcobservedwhenincreasingnumerical
resolution out-of-the-plane (left and right columns). Even our most

Wethusconcludethatstochasticityatafixednumericalsetupim-

in our case, stochastic differences are sub-dominant to the physi-
cal gain of better resolving the multiphase treatment of the outflow.
In particular, even fairly limited improvements (e.g. violet in leftcolumn) bring a significant gain in loading factors that already out-
weigh stochasticity without drastically impacting the computational
cost (Section 5.2).

APPENDIX C: OUTFLOW OPENING ANGLE AS A
FUNCTION OF RESOLUTION
Figure 4 shows a greater opening of the velocity streamlines with
resolution at a single time. Here, we quantify how outflow opening
anglesvaryasafunctionoftimeandrespondtoincreasingresolution.
To illustrate this, we select gas in upper and lower cylinder above
and below the galaxy as in Section 3.1 ( ùëÖ‚â§4.0 kpcand0.5‚â§
|ùëß|‚â§5 kpc). For each gas cell, we then compute the angle of their
velocity vector and the z-direction. Figure C1 then shows the time
series of the average angle for this gas, weighted by specific energy
(to upweight the hot and fast gas). Solid and dashed lines show the
upper and lower outflows, and dotted lines show the median at each
resolution.
We find that, at the highest resolution (cyan), the velocity struc-
ture is systematically more open (median towards larger angles) in
line with the qualitative findings of Figure 4 and aligning with the
increased outflow energetics (Section 3.2). However, there is con-
siderable scatter in opening angles as a function of time, with all
differentresolutionsproducingmoreorlessopenvelocitystructures
with varying outflow conditions. In fact, the median opening angle
does not respond linearly with improving cooling-length resolution
(‚ÄòFiducial‚Äô in purple has the second-most open outflow, but worse
off-the-plane resolution). Furthermore, differences between upper
(solid)andlower(dashed)outflowsarecomparabletotheshiftswith
resolution.Acausallinkbetweenourimprovednumericaltreatment
andsystematicallymoreopenvelocitystreamlinesthusremainsten-
tative, and we hypothesize that repeating this analysis with a longer
time baseline, or in systems with higher mass outflow rates might
help establish this result.APPENDIX D: DIFFERENT OUTFLOW GEOMETRIES AT
5 KPC
Here,wetesttheimportanceofourchosenbiconicalshellgeometry
at 5 kpc. We first show in Figure D1 the same as in Figure 8, but
using the full radial shell rather than restricting on polar angles as
for the fiducial case.
FigureD1recoversallthetrendsobservedinFigure8,inparticular
the energetic hot outflowing phase being hotter and faster moving
at increasing resolution. But using the full radial shell highlights
another feature: slow moving gas spreading between two defined
tracks atùëá=104ùêæandùëá‚âà5√ó106ùêæ. Rather than the outflow
originating from the galaxy, this gas is part of the hot hydrostatic
halo of our galaxy, as evidenced by its sharp drop-off at ùë£=ùë£circ
(wealsoverifiedthatthisgasdefinesalineartrackintheT- ùúåplane).
Our choice of hot halo conditions are fully dictated by the choice of
initial conditions for our isolated galaxy set-up, and its contribution
can be significant when the diffuse gas is poorly resolved (bottom,
left). In our fiducial analysis, we thus aim to mitigate its importance
by selecting a biconical shell to more cleanly separate this gas from
SNe-powered outflow which we aim to study.
InFigureD2,weverifythattrendsofoutflowloadingfactorswith
resolution are unaffected by this choice. We show the time series of
theoutflowmassandenergyloadingfactors(topandbottom)ateach
ofourresolutions(lefttoright)computedthroughourfiducial2-kpc
thick shell at 5 kpc with and without its biconical definition (orange
andred),athinner0.8-kpcshell(gold),anda2-kpcthickshellat10
kpc (brown).
In all cases, the outflow loading factors climb with improved res-
olution (left to right), validating that our trends are robust to these
definitions.Asexpectedduetogeometricalfactors,themassloading
factors defined through the biconical shell are always lower than the
full shell, and mass loading factors decrease between 5 and 10 kpc
(top, orange versus purple). However, perhaps surprisingly, the en-
ergyloadingfactorsincreasewithradius(bottom)despitethelackof
off-the-plane energy injection from stars (e.g. from runaway stars).
This arises due to the rising contribution from the hot ùëá‚âà106K
hydrostatic halo, that acts as heat bath in which the galaxy is em-
bedded. This hot halo can still be pressurized by the SNe-powered
outflowsandslowlyexpand,butmostofitspropertiesaredictatedby
our choice of initial conditions. To avoid this issue, we thus select a
biconicalgeometryforourfiducialanalysisinthisstudy,andplanto
extend our work to a cosmological context studying better-resolved
inflows and outflows in a self-consistent environment.

our lower resolution case (bottom, left). This feature arises from the hot hydrostatic halo of the initial conditions of our galaxy, which we aim to remove in our
fiducial analysis.

Figure D2. Time evolution of the mass (top) and energy (bottom) outflow loading factors measured in different ways. Whether using a thick (orange), thin
(gold), biconical (red) shell placed at 5 kpc or 10 kpc (purple), the outflow loading factors climb with improving resolution in the diffuse gas (left to right).
