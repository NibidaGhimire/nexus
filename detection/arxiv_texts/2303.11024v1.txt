ABSTRACT
We investigate the mass-metallicity relationship of star forming galaxies by analysing the absorption
line spectra of200,000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxy spectra are stacked in
bins of stellar mass and a population synthesis technique is applied yielding metallicities, ages and
star formation history of the young and old stellar population together with interstellar reddening and
extinction. We adopt dierent lengths of the initial starbursts and dierent initial mass functions for
the calculation of model spectra of the single stellar populations contributing to the total integrated
spectrum. We also allow for deviations of the ratio of extinction to reddening R Vfrom 3.1 and
determine the value from the spectral t. We nd that burst length and R Vhave a signicant inuence
on the determination of metallicities whereas the eect of the initial mass function is small. R V
values are larger than 3.1. The metallicities of the young stellar population agree with extragalactic
spectroscopic studies of individual massive supergiant stars and are signicantly higher than those of
the older stellar population. This conrms galaxy evolution models where metallicity depends on the
ratio of gas to stellar mass and where this ratio decreases with time. Star formation history is found
to depend on galaxy stellar mass. Massive galaxies are dominated by stars formed at early times.

1.INTRODUCTION
Star forming galaxies show a tight relationship be-
tween total stellar mass and average metallicity, the
mass-metallicity relationship (\MZR", see for instance
Lequeux et al. 1979; Tremonti et al. 2004; Kudritzki
et al. 2016; Bresolin et al. 2022). This relationship while
evolving and becoming steeper holds out to redshifts z
larger than 3.3 (Vale Asari et al. 2009; Zahid et al. 2014;
Genzel et al. 2015; Sanders et al. 2021). In view of the
complicated interplay between complex processes such
as gas accretion, star formation, nucleosynthesis and
chemical evolution, stellar and galactic winds, dynami-

tionship such as the MZR seems to be a Rosetta stone to
understand galaxy formation and evolution. As a conse-
quence, a large variety of approaches has been developed
to use the MZR as a constraint of galaxy formation and
evolution, Dav e et al. (2011), Yates et al. (2012), Dayal
et al. (2013), Schaye et al. (2015), Peng et al. (2015), Spi-
toni et al. (2017a,b), Pantoni et al. (2019), Lapi et al.
(2020), Spitoni et al. (2020), Trussler et al. (2020), Ku-
dritzki et al. (2021a,b) to name only a few. However,
there is an important problem. Many of the observa-
tional MZR results obtained are based on measurements
of the strongest ionized interstellar medium (ISM) emis-
sion lines, which are then converted into oxygen abun-
dances. These \strong line methods" depend heavily on
the calibration method used. Kewley & Ellison (2008)arXiv:2303.11024v1  [astro-ph.GA]  20 Mar 20232 Sextl et al.
in an emission line analysis of 50,000 star forming Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies demonstrated con-
vincingly that the systematic uncertainties in oxygen
abundances can be as large as 0.8 dex. As a result,
the slope of the MZR can vary signicantly for the same
set of observed emission line data depending on the cal-
ibration applied.
An obvious alternative approach is the analysis of low
resolution absorption line spectra of individual stars.
Blue and red supergiants (BSG and RSG) as the bright-
est stars at visual or infra-red light, respectively, are
the ideal objects for this purpose. Galaxy metallicities
obtained by this method have only small uncertainties
of at most 0.1 dex (systematic and random, see Gazak
et al. 2015) and have been used to construct a very reli-
able MZR, see Kudritzki et al. 2016; Davies et al. 2017;
Bresolin et al. 2022, and references therein. Unfortu-
nately, the method is limited with respect to galactic
distance. The most distant objects studied so far are
the Antennae galaxies and their super star clusters at
20 Mpc (Lardo et al. 2015).
In view of this limitation a third technique which has
been well advanced over the last two decades has be-
come truly important, the analysis of stellar absorption
line spectra of the integrated stellar population through
population synthesis techniques. The advantage of this
technique is that it reaches out to much larger distances
because of the relatively high surface brightnesses of
galaxies. In addition, it can provide information about
the young and old stellar population and the star for-
mation history.
The general idea was pioneered by Tinsley (1968)
and Spinrad & Taylor (1972). With signicant fur-
ther improvements of stellar evolution theory and stel-
lar spectral modelling the concept was then advanced
by many groups, see for instance Arimoto & Yoshii
(1987), Bressan et al. (1996), Reichardt et al. (2001),
Bruzual & Charlot (2003), Cardiel et al. (2003) and ref-
erences therein. More recent work used the advantages
of increased computer power and improved the method
for applications on massive spectroscopic galaxy surves,
rst focussing on spectra of the central regions of galax-
ies (Gallazzi et al. 2005; Cid Fernandes et al. 2005; Pan-
ter et al. 2008; Conroy et al. 2009; Koleva et al. 2009;
S anchez-Bl azquez et al. 2011; Peng et al. 2015; Zahid
et al. 2017) and later on spectra of spatially resolved
regions of galaxies obtained with Integral Field Units
(Yoachim et al. 2012; Gonz alez Delgado et al. 2015;
Schaefer et al. 2017; Parikh et al. 2021).
Given the enormous potential of this technique it is
important to carefully assess the systematic eects aris-
ing from the large variety of assumptions which enterthis approach. While this has been done already to a
large extend in previous work, our work presented here is
investigating a variety of additional important aspects,
which have not been addressed so far in much detail. We
study the eects of nite star formation burst lengths
compared with instantaneous bursts, the eects of pre-
main sequence evolution and initial mass function and
we assess the inuence of an interstellar reddening law
characterized by a ratio R Vof extinction to reddening
deviating from the standard value of 3.1. We will also
investigate the inuence of star formation rate (SFR)
on MZR, extinction and ages. For this purpose we start
from our previous work (Zahid et al. 2017) and apply an
improved technique to analyse a sample of 200,000 SDSS
star forming galaxies with spectra stacked into bins of
stellar mass. We compare the MZRs obtained in this
way for the dierent assumptions with the MZR from
supergiant spectroscopy, which we use as benchmark.
We will also discuss stellar ages and star formation his-
tory.
2.OBSERVED SPECTRA AND ANALYSIS
TECHNIQUE
The same dataset as described in Zahid et al. (2017) is
used. The observations consist of SDSS spectra of about
200,000 star forming galaxies in the redshift range 0.027
z0.25. The galaxies were selected according to the
strengths of their interstellar medium (ISM) emission
lines and the redshift range was chosen to ensure rest-
frame wavelength coverage of the [OII] 3727 and7330
emission lines. Since we are interested only in the aver-
age galaxy properties as a function of their stellar mass,
we have stacked the spectra in 25 bins of stellar mass
log M (measured in units of M) from 8.55 to 10.95
in steps of 0.1 dex. In this way the signal-to-noise is
strongly enhanced for the analysis and ranges from 160
at the low mass end to 1300 at higher masses (see Table
in Zahid et al. (2017)). To avoid systematic eects as a
function of stellar mass caused by dierent line widths
we have convolved all spectra to the line width FWHM
= 330 km s 1found for the bin with the highest stellar
mass. In addition, the spectra are normalized by setting
the mean ux between 4400 and 4450 A equal to unity.
Details of galaxy selection, stellar mass determination,
stacking and convolution procedure are given in Zahid
et al. (2017).
The spectra of the 25 mass bins are shown in Fig-
ure 1. Strikingly, the SED slope changes from low to
high stellar mass and the stellar absorption lines become
stronger. We will show that this is caused by systematic
dierences in interstellar extinction, average stellar age
and metallicity.Mass Metallicity Relationship of SDSS Star Forming Galaxies 3
Figure 1. Fluxes (arbitrary units) of the stacked SDSS
spectra in 25 mass bins from log M = 8.55 (top) to 10.95
(bottom). For clarity the spectra are shifted by 0.2 units
from one mass bin to the next.
The technique to analyse these spectra in order to
extract information about stellar population metallicity
and ages is a modication of the approach introduced
by Zahid et al. (2017). We model the spectrum of the
integrated stellar population M as a linear combination
of the spectra of single stellar bursts (SSB) f ;i(ti, [Z]i)

depends on interstellar reddening E(B-V) and R V=
AV/E(B-V) the ratio of interstellar extinction to red-
dening in the V-band. The value of R Vcharacterizes the
reddening law, at least to rst order. As is well known
from studies of stellar SEDs in star forming regions, R V
can cover a wide range from 2 to 6 (see, for instance,
Urbaneja et al. 2017). We use the interstellar redden-
ing law by O'Donnell (1994), which is a modication of
Cardelli et al. (1989).
The SSB spectra are calculated using the Flexible Stel-
lar Population Synthesis code (FSPS, version 3.2) (Con-
roy et al. 2009; Conroy & Gunn 2010) and adopting a
Chabrier (2003) initial mass function, the MILES stellar
spectral library (S anchez-Bl azquez et al. 2006) and the
MESA stellar evolution isochrones (MIST, Choi et al.
2016; Dotter 2016). We also account for nite time
lengths of the stellar bursts (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 Myr). This
will be discussed in the next section. Finally, our model
spectra are normalized in the same way as the observed
spectra, convolved to the equal resolution and interpo-
lated to the same integer values of wavelength points as
the observed spectra.
The modelling of the spectra by eq. (1) does not ac-
count for the contribution of a potential HII-region neb-
ular continuum, which can become important in cases
of extremely high star formation rates with very strong
nebular emission as shown by Cardoso et al. (2022).
However, the strength of the hydrogen nebular emis-
sion lines relative to the stellar continuum allows us to
estimate the eects of nebular continuum emission for
our analysis. The H emission equivalent widths in our
stacked spectra is .20A and, thus, the nebular con-
tinuum contribution to the total spectrum is very small.4 Sextl et al.
Figure 3. Luminosities of SSBs as a function of age (yrs)
for dierent spectral passbands (pink: U, blue: B, green: V,
red: R, orange: I). The solid curves correspond to a burst
duration t b= 0.1 Myr, the dashed curves to t b= 10 Myr.
The bottom gure shows the logarithm of the ratio of lu-
minosities of 10 Myr to 0.1 Myr bursts at larger ages. A
metallicity of [Z]=0 has been used for this example.
We have veried this conclusion by estimating the neb-
ular contribution from the measurement of H emission
equivalent width and by subtracting a theoretical red-
dened nebular continuum. We have then repeated the
analysis with modied spectrum and found only very
small changes with respect to metallicity ( 0.01 dex)
and age (1%). In our analysis of the SFR dependence
of the stellar MZRs in section 9 below we have encoun-
tered a very few cases in the highest SFR quintile with
larger Hequivalent widths. But even here the eects
on metallicity were smaller than 0.05 dex.
For the selection of metallicities and ages of the SSB
spectra we use two rectangular grids consisting of 9 [Z]
values and 52 (high age resolution) and 20 (low age res-
olution) ages, respectively. The metallicities range from
[Z] = -1.5 to 0.5 increasing in steps of 0.25 dex. The

low resolution ages start at 1Myr and increase in loga-
rithmic steps of  log t[Gyr] = 0.25 until 7.08 Gyr and
then continue with 8.91, 10.0 and 12.59 Gyr. The high
resolution age grid starts at 0.1 Myr with a step to 1.0
Myr and then continues with logarithmic steps  log
t[Gyr] alternating between 0.05 and 0.1 until 12.59 Gyr
are reached. This leads to a total number of SSB n SSB
= 468 in the high age resolution and 180 in the low
resolution case. Metallicities and ages are illustrated in
Figure 2.
In the t of the observed spectra with the model spec-
tra we then adopt a grid of R Vand E(B-V) values. For
each pair of R Vand E(B-V) we calculate the wavelength
dependent dust attenuation factor D (RV;E(B V))
and use the bonded-variables least squares (BVLS) al-
gorithm by Stark & Parker (1995), translated to IDL
by Michele Cappellari1to determine the coecients b i.
With the b ithe comparison of the model spectrum with
the observations leads to a 2value for each R V, E(B-V)

The choice of 1.6 Gyr for the denition of the young
population is motivated by galaxy chemical evolution
models which show only small changes ( 0.1 dex) of
metallicity during the nal 1 to 2 Gyrs of evolution (Spi-
toni et al. 2017a,b; Kudritzki et al. 2021a,b). Moreover,
the molecular gas depletion time which denes star for-
mation eciency, is of the same order (1.9 Gyr, see Leroy
et al. 2008). They young and old population tting is
insensitive to the selected value, for instance, chosing
2.5 instead of 1.6 Gyr does not change the results.
We note that due to the normalization of our spectra
between 4400 and 4450 A the [Z] and t-values obtained
in this way are eectively B-band luminosity weighted
metallicities and ages. This will become more evident
further below.
The results for metallicities, ages, reddening and ex-
tinction obtained in this way will be discussed in the
next sections.
3.THE EFFECTS OF STAR FORMATION BURST
LENGTH ON SSB SPECTRA
Most commonly, the spectra of star bursts are calcu-
lated by adopting the approximation of so-called \in-
stantaneous bursts", for which the stellar evolution
isochrone at one singular time step is used. However,
as is well known, star formation in star forming regions
is not instantaneous but happens over nite time scales.
For instance, as shown by Efremov & Elmegreen (1998),
the star formation time t bof a burst is correlated with
the size of the star forming region and can cover a wide
range from 0.1 to 10 Myr in regions where associations
and star clusters form. More recent work on star for-
mation in molecular clouds conrmed burst lengths of a
few million years (Corbelli et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2021).
It is, thus, important to investigate what inuence t b
can have on the burst model spectra and the resulting
analysis.

wavelength of an isochrone of age , then the lumi-6 Sextl et al.

We adopted constant star formation rate during the
burst and L( ,t,t0,tb) is the luminosity averaged over
the duration of the burst. Figures 3 and 4 show the
eects of burst duration on the luminosities of SSBs as
a function of age in dierent spectral bands. They arequite dramatic around the peak at ages of 5-10 Myrs
(up to 0.3 dex) and then become weaker but continue
to be noticeable ( 0.005 dex) compared with the S/N
of the spectra until values of t b/t0.02 are reached
(see Figures 3 bottom). This is a consequence of the
power law behaviour L iso(X,t)/t nfor larger values of
t which leads to L(X,t,t 0,tb) = Liso(X,t)(1+nt b/(2t)) for
small values of t b/t. X stands for the spectral passband
(U, V, B, R, I). In the same way the spectra of SSBs
show the eects of burst length. Examples are given in
gures 5 and 6. The dierences between the spectra of
dierent burst length become small at ages much larger
than the burst length as discussed above. We note that
all luminosities are given in units of the solar luminosity
L.
The inuence of the adopted burst lengths on the anal-
ysis of the observed spectra will be investigated in the
next section.
4.ANALYSIS WITH DIFFERENT BURST
LENGTHS AND TIME RESOLUTION
In this section we use SSBs calculated for dierent
burst lengths and time resolution to analyse our stacked
SDSS spectra. We note that we allow for variations of
RVin our spectral ts. As will be discussed in section 5,
the RVobtained are substantially higher than 3.1 (see
Figure 13).
Figures 7 and 8 summarize the results with respect
to the MZR. We show metallicities of the young and
old population and average metallicities as a function
of stellar mass obtained when using the dierent sets of
SSBs and compare with with the MZR of massive su-
pergiant stars, which has been obtained by quantitative
spectroscopy of individual objects in 17 nearby galaxies
(see Bresolin et al. 2022 and references therein). These
metallicities are accurate to 0.1 dex and serve as a bench-
mark for the young stellar population. The metallicity
uncertainties of the SDSS spectral ts as shown in Fig-
ures 7 and 8 are up to 0.07 dex for the young and old
population, respectively, and 0.03 dex for the average
over all ages. They are obtained from Monte Carlo sim-
ulations with ts of the observed stacked spectra modi-
ed by adding Gaussian noise.
Figures 7 and 8 indicate that burst length and SSB
time resolution have a signicant eect of up to 0.4
dex on the determination [Z] young , the metallicity of the
young stellar population. The inuence on the average
metallicity [Z] is somewhat smaller (up to 0.2 dex) and
the dierences for the old population are below or about
0.1 dex and, thus, of the order of the t uncertainties.
A comparison of all metallicities obtained with dierent
burst lengths is given in Figure 9.Mass Metallicity Relationship of SDSS Star Forming Galaxies 7

licities of the young (blue) and old (red) stellar population

benchmark for the young stellar population.

the SSB models with the shortest burst length of 0.1 Myr
and high time resolution provide the best t, although8 Sextl et al.

SDSS young stellar population metallicities are in very
good agreement with the metallicities of our supergiant
benchmark sample (see Figure 7) . We take this as an
indication that the population synthesis method is reli-
able.
Figure 10 shows the t of the SDSS spectrum at log
M= 9.75 as a typical example.
The metallicities obtained for the old stellar popu-
lation [Z] oldare signicantly lower than [Z] young . This
reects galactic chemical evolution and will be discussed
below.
We note that Zahid et al. (2017) in their work have
used SSB with 10 Myr burst length and compared their
average metallicities [Z] with the supergiant values nd-
ing good agreement. We conrm their result (see Figure
8), but we note that this comparison is misleading. Since
supergiants have ages around 50 Myr, a comparison with
[Z]young would have been more appropriate.
The average stellar ages t avand the ages of the young
and old population obtained with SSB of t b= 0.1 Myr
and the high age resolution grid are displayed in Figure
11 together with their error bars. The ages between
50 and 300 Myr of the young population conrm that
a comparison with supergiant stars as a benchmark is
appropriate. We notice a clear correlation of t young with
galactic stellar mass. No correlation is obtained for t av
and the age t oldof the old population.
The average redshift of our galaxy sample is z=0.08
corresponding to a cosmological lookback time of 1.05

lookback time of 11 Gyr equivalent to a redshift of z 
2.5. Thus, the metallicities obtained for the old stellar
population in Figure 7 and 8 correspond to z 2.5.
The t of the observed spectrum yields the coecients
biin eq. (1) for the individual bursts, which can be
related to the relative number contribution N iof stars
of isochrone i, for which the SSB model spectrum is
calculated, via
bi=NiLi(X): (11)
Li(X) is the luminosity of the isochrone in passband
X with an eective wavelength which corresponds to the
wavelength at which the observed spectra and the SSB
spectra are normalized. Since our normalization interval
is 4400 to 4450 A the B-band is the appropriate choice
for X (examples for L i(X) as a function of isochrone age
are given in Figures 3 and 4). Eq. (11) explains why
the metallicities and ages of our spectral ts are B-band
luminosity weighted quantities.
Since Ni/ iti, where t iis the time interval be-

5.REDDENING AND THE EFFECTS OF THE
EXTINCTION LAW
Since a long time there have been clear indications of
deviations from the standard value R V= 3.1 in star
forming regions of the Milky Way (see, for example,
Feinstein et al. 1973; Herbst 1976; The et al. 1980;
Cardelli et al. 1989). Similar results have been found for
the Large Magellanic Cloud, see Ma z Apell aniz et al.
(2017), Urbaneja et al. (2017) and Holwerda & Keel
(2013) in their dierential IFU SED study of two galaxy
pairs conclude that the canonical extinction law with
RV= 3.1 does not t their data. In consequence, it is
important to keep R Vas free parameter for the SSB ts
of the observed spectra as described in section 2.
Figure 13 (top) shows the R Vvalues obtained in our
analysis for the case of t b= 0.1Myr and high age res-
olution. While the values at lower stellar masses have
large uncertainties, we generally nd values larger than
3.1 at all stellar masses. We believe the reason is that
the SDSS observations sample the central regions of the
star forming galaxies where still a lot of star formation in
dense clouds is going on. These natal birthclouds act as
an additional source of attenuation. In consequence, the
contribution of the diuse ISM with R V= 3.1 is small.
We speculate that the reason for the obvious correlation
with stellar mass is that the young stellar population is
younger at lower mass (see Figure 11) and that the den-
sity in the star forming regions is higher. The inuence
of varying density has been described by Witt & Gor-
don in a series of seminal papers (Witt & Gordon 1996;
Gordon et al. 1997; Witt & Gordon 2000). As a rule
of thumb, an increasing inhomogeneity with alternat-Mass Metallicity Relationship of SDSS Star Forming Galaxies 11

ing high- and low-density regions in the ISM structure
leads to attened ('grayer') attenuation curves. In our
case, using a CCM/O'Donnell extinction law, a shal-
lower slope is equivalent to high values of RV. See also
Berlind et al. (1997) for an in depth discussion of this
issue in case of the galaxy NGC2207.
We note that the average value found for the LMC
(log M = 9.2) by Urbaneja et al. (2017), R V= 4.6,
is in good agreement with Figure 13. It is important
to note that the dierence from the standard reddening
law in star forming galaxies at all masses has important
consequences for other aspects of astrophysics. For in-
stance, the estimate of galaxy luminosities and the cor-
responding mass to light ratios can be aected. Distance
determinations based on stellar distance indicators and
the resulting cosmological distance ladder might be in-
uenced as well (see, for instance, Urbaneja et al. 2017;
Falco et al. 1999).
Reddening E(B-V) and V-band extinction A Vare also
shown in Figure 13 (middle and bottom, respectively).
Again, there is a clear correlation with stellar mass.
Such correlations have already been found in previous
work (Brinchmann et al. 2004; Asari et al. 2007; Garn
& Best 2010; Zahid et al. 2013). We note, however, that12 Sextl et al.

the deviation of R Vfrom the standard value 3.1 leads to
signicantly higher extinction of about 0.2 magnitudes.
Ignoring a potential variation of R Vand restricting to
values of 3.1 also aects the determination of metallic-
ities and the MZR. This is demonstrated in Figure 14,
where results obtained with R V= 3.1 are over-plotted.
With dierences up to 0.4 dex the eects are signicant
for the young and old population, most importantly in
the middle mass range.

the young and population, respectively, and 15% for the
average stellar age.

6.SPECTRAL NORMALIZATION
The metallicities and ages obtained in the previous
sections are B-band luminosity averages because we have
normalized our spectra by setting the mean ux between
4400 and 4450 A to unity. This is illustrated by eq. (11).
It is, therefore, important to investigate how metallici-
ties and ages change depending on the wavelength inter-
val selected for normalization. For that purpose we have
repeated the analysis with normalizations between 5500
and 5550 A (V-band) and 6950 and 7000 A (R-band).
The comparison of the metallicities and ages obtained
with the dierent normalizations are shown in Figure
15.
The dierences between the dierent normalizations
are small. The metallicities of the young and old popu-
lation increase gradually with the normalization shiftedMass Metallicity Relationship of SDSS Star Forming Galaxies 13
towards the red, but the maximum dierence is 0.1
dex only slightly larger than the metallicity uncertain-
ties discussed in section 4. Ages also increase by a small
amount but the dierences are comparable to the errors
shown in Figure 16.
We note that R V, E(B-V), A Vand the star formation
histories (as displayed in Figure 12) remain unchanged
and do not depend on the spectral normalization inter-
val.
7.INITIAL MASS FUNCTION AND PRE-MAIN
SEQUENCE EVOLUTION
For our calculation of SSB model spectra we have
adopted a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF).
As discussed by Conroy et al. (2009), there are viable
alternatives such as the IMFs by Kroupa (2001) and van
Dokkum (2008). In order to investigate the inuence of
the choice of the IMF on our analysis we have addition-
ally calculated model spectra with these two alternatives
and then repeated the analysis. The resulting MZRs
are shown in Figure 16 for high time resolution and t b
= 0.1Myr. While the dierences in metallicity arising
from the choices of the dierent IMFs are noticeable,
they are at most 0.05 dex and, thus, not a major source
of systematic uncertainties. We have also included cal-
culations with the original IMF suggested by Salpeter
(1955), which is a simple power law without a modi-
cation at the low mass end. Here the dierences are
larger, 0.1 dex for the young and up to 0.2 dex for the
old stellar population, respectively. Figure 16 conrms
the results found in previous work (Cid Fernandes et al.
2005; Wilkinson et al. 2017).
The MESA stellar isochrones used in the calculation
of our spectra include pre-main sequence evolution to-
wards the zero-age mains sequence (ZAMS). As a con-
sequence, young isochrones for which the more massive
stars are leaving the main sequence have a contribu-
tion from stars with lower mass, which are still mov-
ing towards the main sequence and have luminosities
signicantly higher than the ZAMS at the same stellar
mass (see Choi et al. 2016 and Dotter 2016). Because
of the IMF these lower mass pre-main sequence objects
could, thus, inuence the integrated isochrone spectra
and lead to dierences when compared with isochrones
just starting at the ZAMS. Since such isochrones have
also been used in population synthesis diagnostic work,
we have carried out an additional test with modied
MESA isochrones, which start at the ZAMS. As it turns
out, the MZRs obtained with model spectra calculated
in this way are very similar to the ones where pre-main
sequence evolution is included. The reason is the high
luminosity of the more massive star on the main se-

quence or moving away, which have a dominating inu-
ence on the total spectrum. The inclusion of the pre-14 Sextl et al.
main sequence phase is obviously of minor importance
for the results of our spectral diagnostics.

color code is the same as in Figure 18 but only three bins
are shown for the sake of clarity.
8.A COMPARISON WITH LOOKBACK GALAXY
EVOLUTION MODELS
Figure 7 and 8 indicate a strong evolution of stel-
lar metallicities as a function of age. The metallicities
of the old population which is about 10 Gyr older are
signicantly lower and the dierence is anti-correlated
with galaxy stellar mass. This can be understood with
the help of galaxy evolution models using the stan-
dard framework of chemical evolution. Kudritzki et al.
(2021a,b) have introduced 'lookback' models where the
competing processes of gas infall from the cosmic web
and the circumgalactic medium, galactic winds and star
formation are assumed to lead to a redshift dependent
power law relationship between galactic gas mass and
stellar mass, M g= A(z)M
and stars are formed along
the observed star formation main sequences with star
formation rates  = 0(z)M. With these assumptions
and the usual chemical evolution equation metallicity
[Z] becomes a simple analytical function of the ratio of
stellar to gas mass M /Mgand decreases when this ra-
tio becomes smaller. This is very similar to the classical
closed box model of chemical evolution (Searle & Sar-
gent 1972) but quantitatively the result is substantially
dierent because of the power law dependence between
gas and stellar mass.
Figure 17 (top) shows the metallicities of the lookback
evolution model for each galaxy with dierent stellarmass for the young stars and stars 10 Gyr older over-
plotted to the result of our SDSS spectral analysis and
the individual supergiants stars in galaxies. We note
that these metallicities are luminosity weighted in the
B-band. Details of the model are described in Kudritzki
et al. (2021a,b). We note that = 0.5 is adopted and
 0(z) has been increased by a factor of three to be in
better agreement with the star formation rates of the
SDSS galaxies at redshift z=0.08. The relative redshift
dependence  (z) remains the same.
The agreement of the lookback models with the ob-
servations is good. The model reproduces the shape of
the young stellar population MZR well and also the dif-
ference of the metallicities between the young stars and
the old stars. We note that the galaxy stellar masses
at lookback time t = 10 Gyr are signicantly smaller
than the nal stellar masses. This is shown in the bot-
tom part of Figure 17. The dierence in stellar mass
together with dependence of metallicity on M /Mgis
the reason why the decline of the metallicity of the old
population with decreasing stellar mass is steeper than
for the younger population. Because of this mass dier-
ence the red curve in Figure 17 (top) does not represent a
mass metallicity relationship at high redshift (z 2.5),
but instead, describes the chemical evolution of these
galaxies.
9.STAR FORMATION RATE DEPENDENCE OF
METALLICITY AND AGES
From the study of HII region emission lines it has
been found that MZRs contain a dependence on star
formation rates as a third parameter (Mannucci et al.
2010; Yates et al. 2012; Sanders et al. 2021). Galax-
ies with higher star formation rates tend to have lower
metallicities. Our analysis of stellar spectra provides
the opportunity to investigate this eect with respect
to stellar populations. For that purpose we follow the
approach by Zahid et al. (2017) and divide the sample
of our 200,000 SDSS spectra in quintiles of star forma-
tion rate. We then stack the spectra of these quintiles
at each stellar mass and run our analysis on the stacked
spectra of the quintiles. Since the spectra in the high-
est SFR quintile show strong HII emission lines for the
lowest galaxy stellar masses, we include the eects of
nebular continuum emission in our analysis as described
in section 2. We use SSB with high age resolution and
a short burst length t b= 0.1Myr for the analysis.
The resulting MZRs for the young and old population
are given in Figure 18. We see a clear correlation with
SFR for both the young population at high masses and
the old population at intermediate masses. The metal-Mass Metallicity Relationship of SDSS Star Forming Galaxies 15
licity errors are of the same order as shown in Figure 7
and described in section 4.
We have also determined population ages t young , told,
andtav. While t young and toldseem independent of star
formation rate, the average age of the total population
tavas shown in Figure 19 reveals a very clear depen-
dence. The average population in galaxies with a lower
star formation rate is signicantly older. Obviously, at
the lower star formation rates it takes the galaxies much
longer to build up their stellar population. In conse-
quence, the contribution by the old stellar population
boldto the spectral t is much higher, as is also shown
in Figure 19. (Note that t av= byoung tyoung + boldtold
and that the second term dominates).
The stronger contribution of the older population is
also reected in the star formation history expressed by
the ratio young / oldof star formation rates of the
young to the old population. As Figure 20 demon-
strates, this ratio is signicantly smaller for galaxies
with presently lower star formation rates.
10.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this section we summarize and discuss the major
results of this work. In a rst step we have investigated
the inuence of star formation burst lengths t bon the
results of the population synthesis analysis. As obser-
vations show (see section 3), t bdepends on the size of
the star forming region and can range from a fraction
of a Myr to many Myr. We nd that the assumption of
burst length inuences the spectra of stellar isochrones
signicantly depending, of course, on isochrone age t
and tb. For ages t with t b/t0.02 the signatures of
burst length are clearly visible in the spectra. This af-
fects the results of the population synthesis analysis, in
particular, the metallicities of the young stellar popula-
tion. Judging the quality of the spectral ts by means
of their minimum 2value we nd that burst spectra
calculated with t b= 0.1 and 1.0 Myr give the best t.
Fits with 10 Myr bursts are worse.
Since we model the spectrum of the integrated stellar
population as a sequence of bursts with dierent ages,
the time resolution of this sequence is important. We
have, therefore, tested the inuence of the time resolu-
tion using two grids with dierent resolution of isochrone
age steps. We nd that the higher time resolution leads
to lower2values of the spectral ts.
The analysis of the galaxy spectra with respect to
metallicity and age requires a determination of inter-
stellar reddening and extinction. Since it is well know
that in the star forming regions of galaxies reddening
laws deviate from the standard law of the diuse ISM
characterized by the R V= 3.1, we determine R Vasan independent additional parameter. We nd values
clearly larger than 3.1 indicating a strong contribution
of dense star forming regions to the reddening. The R V
values are largest for low mass galaxies. For these galax-
ies the average age of the young population is lowest. In
consequence, the contribution by stars originating from
compact regions of star formation might be strongest.
Allowing for deviations of R Vfrom 3.1 has a signicant
inuence on the determination of metallicity (up to 0.4
dex), population ages (10 to 50% and, of course, inter-
stellar extinction (0.2 magnitudes). We note that this
striking general dierence from the standard reddening
law in star forming galaxies has important consequences
for other aspects of astrophysics such as, for instance,
distance determinations and the cosmological distance
ladder or the estimate of galaxy luminosities.
The metallicity of the young population of our star
forming SDSS galaxies is in good agreement with mas-
sive supergiant stars where the metallicities are obtained
through accurate spectral analysis of a large sample of
galaxies in the local universe. We take this as a cru-
cial conrmation that our population synthesis analysis
technique is reliable. The average age we derive for the
young population is between 50 and 300 Myrs increasing
with galactic stellar mass. It is, thus, in the same range
as the supergiant ages and, consequently, we expect the
metallicities to be similar.
We also determine the average metallicities and ages
of the old population. The metallicities are signicantly
smaller than for the young population. The age dier-
ence to the young population is about 10 Gyr. Thus, we
are seeing the results of chemical evolution over 10 Gyr.
We compare these results with galaxy evolution look
back models and nd good agreement. Both, the mass-
metallicity relationship of the young population and the
metallicities of the old population are well reproduced.
This supports a galaxy evolution model where metallic-
ity depends on the ratio of gas mass to stellar mass and
where this ratio decreases with time.
For this comparison we calculated B-band luminos-
ity weighted metallicities of our models because our ob-
served and model spectra are normalized to unity be-
tween 4400 to 4450 A and our analysis eectively pro-
vides B-band luminosity weighted metallicities and ages.
However, we have checked the eects of normalization
by introducing normalizations between 5500 and 5550
and 6950 and 7000 A and found that they are small.
Changes due to the dierent normalizations are compa-
rable to the t uncertainties.
From the weight contributions to the total spectrum
of isochrones at dierent ages we can also estimate star
formation rates. We calculate the ratio of star forma-16 Sextl et al.
tion rate of the young and old population and nd an
anti-correlation with galaxy stellar mass. Low mass
galaxies show a much higher star formation contribu-
tion of the younger population. On the other hand, more
massive galaxies are dominated by stars that formed at
early times. This is in agreement with the observations
of \galaxy downsizing" as originally detected by Cowie
et al. (1996) and followed up in comprehensive galaxy
survey work (see, for instance, Pilyugin & Thuan 2011;
Thomas et al. 2019 and references therein).
For the calculation of our model spectra we have as-
sumed a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function. In order
to test the inuence of this assumption we repeat the
analysis using the IMFs by Kroupa (2001), van Dokkum
(2008) and Salpeter (1955). The dierences with respect
to metallicity are very small ( 0.05 dex) for the rst
three IMFs, but are larger for the Salpeter IMF (0.1 dex
and 0.2 dex for the young and old population, respec-
tively).
Finally, we investigate the dependence of metallicity
and ages on star formation rate. We stack the spec-
tra of the 200,000 SDSS galaxies in quintiles of SFR ateach stellar mass and repeat the analysis for each quin-
tile. We nd a correlation of metallicity with SFR for
higher and intermediate stellar masses for the young and
old population. In addition, the average age of the to-
tal stellar population shows a clear dependence on SFR.
The population in galaxies with lower SFR is signi-
cantly older and the contribution of the old population
to the integrated spectrum is much larger. In the same
way, the ratio of SFR of the young to the old population
is smaller for galaxies with smaller SFR.
In summary, the results provide important implica-
tions for galaxy evolution and underline the power of
spectroscopic population synthesis analysis techniques.
