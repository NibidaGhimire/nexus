ABSTRACT
We use adaptive-optics imaging and integral field spectroscopy from the Very Large Telescope, together with images from the Hubble
Space Telescope , to study the near-infrared (NIR) evolution of the equatorial ring (ER) of SN 1987A. We study the NIR line and
continuum flux and morphology over time in order to lay the groundwork for James Webb Space Telescope observations of the
system. We also study the di fferences in the interacting ring structure and flux between optical, NIR and other wavelengths, and
between line and continuum emission, to constrain the underlying physical processes. Mostly the evolution is similar in the NIR and
optical. The morphology of the ER has been skewed toward the west side (with roughly 2 /3 of the NIR emission originating there)
since around 2010. A steady decline in the ER flux, broadly similar to the MIR and the optical, is ongoing since roughly this time as
well. The expansion velocity of the ER hotspots in the NIR is fully consistent with the optical. However, continuum emission forms
roughly 70 per cent of the NIR luminosity, and is relatively stronger outside the hotspot-defined extent of the ER than the optical
emission or NIR line emission since 2012–2013, suggesting a faster-expanding continuum component. We find that this outer NIR
emission can have a significant synchrotron contribution. Even if emission from hot ( ∼2000 K) dust is dominant within the ER, the
mass of this dust must be vanishingly small (a few ×10−12M⊙) compared to the total dust mass in the ER ( ≳10−5M⊙) to account
for the observed HKs flux. The NIR continuum emission, however, expands slower than the more di ffuse 180-K dust emission that
dominates in the MIR, indicating a di fferent source, and the same hot dust component cannot account for the J-band emission.

1. Introduction
Over the past three decades and more, supernova (SN) 1987A
has proven to be one of the most important transient events ever
observed. Its location only ∼50 kpc from us (Pietrzy ´nski et al.
2019), in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), combined with the
high spatial resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and
adaptive optics (AO) facilities, has allowed us to study this SN
and its transition into a SN remnant (SNR) in a uniquely detailed
manner. The insights gained from this follow-up concern topics
such as nucleosynthesis (e.g. Jerkstrand et al. 2011), the late-
time evolution of the progenitor system and the di fferent power
sources of the SN from radioactive56Ni and44Ti decay to inter-
action (for reviews, see e.g. McCray & Fransson 2016; Milisavl-
jevic & Fesen 2017). Previously, SN 1987A has been observed
in the near- and mid-infrared (NIR and MIR, respectively) using
ground-based telescopes, the Stratospheric Observatory for In-
frared Astronomy (SOFIA ) and the Spitzer Space Telescope (e.g.
Bouchet et al. 2006; Dwek et al. 2010; Arendt et al. 2016; Frans-
son et al. 2016; Larsson et al. 2016; Matsuura et al. 2022), with
which it has been possible to study dust, molecules and ejecta
morphology. With the recent launch of the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST ), it is now possible to increase the detail of the
follow-up even further in the infrared (the first JWST study of

088.D-0638(D), 090.D-0645(E), 094.D-0505(D) and 096.D-0882(D).SN 1987A was presented by Larsson et al. 2023). With that in
mind, an analysis of the time evolution of SN 1987A in the NIR
is now timely for setting the baseline for JWST studies.
At most wavelengths, the evolving remnant of SN 1987A is
dominated by the interaction between the SN ejecta and its cir-
cumstellar medium (CSM). The CSM has a well-known triple-
ring structure, with an inner equatorial ring (ER) and two outer
rings in an hourglass-like shape inclined by ∼40◦(e.g. Tzi-
amtzis et al. 2011). The triple-ring CSM is well replicated by
a model in which the matter was ejected 20000 yr ago (Crotts &
Heathcote 2000) following a merger of a binary star with initial
masses of 14–15 and 7–9 M ⊙(Menon & Heger 2017; Urushibata
et al. 2018), creating the known immediate progenitor, a blue
supergiant of∼20 M⊙. The optical and NIR brightness of the
ER has been dominated since about the turn of the millennium
by hotspots created by the forward shock of the SN crashing
into dense clumps in the ER (Borkowski et al. 1997; Sonneborn
et al. 1998; Lawrence et al. 2000). The hotspots emit especially
strongly in optical and NIR lines (Kjær et al. 2007; Gröningsson
et al. 2008). Since about 2009, these hotspots have been fading
(Fransson et al. 2015; Arendt et al. 2016, 2020) as the fastest
ejecta have cleared the ER and now interact with matter outside
the ring (Larsson et al. 2019; Kangas et al. 2022), creating new
hotspots there. The fading and destruction of the ER will, how-
ever, take some time (e.g. Orlando et al. 2019).
Dust has a large influence on the infrared emission of the sys-
tem. Cool dust formed in the ejecta (on the order of 0.5 M ⊙of

silicate and carbon dust combined, at ∼20 K; Indebetouw et al.
2014; Matsuura et al. 2015; Cigan et al. 2019)1has been ar-
gued to be responsible for most of the far-infrared (FIR) lumi-
nosity of the ejecta, which also provides most of its bolometric
luminosity (McCray & Fransson 2016). In the ER, cool dust is
less important, but warmer dust dominates the MIR flux (while
the inner ejecta contributes very little in the MIR; Arendt et al.
2020) – the spectral energy distribution is consistent with sili-
cate dust at 180 K (Bouchet et al. 2006; Dwek et al. 2010), with
a weaker, hotter component at shorter wavelengths. Amorphous
carbon dust at 525 K was deemed consistent with the hotter com-
ponent by Arendt et al. (2016). Later observations have revealed
emerging emission between 30 and 70 µm at 10000 d, indica-
tive of a dust mass of >3×10−4M⊙in the ER (Matsuura et al.
2019), compared to ∼10−5M⊙at 8000 d, requiring ongoing dust
formation in the ER or possibly a contribution from the warmest
ejecta dust. Compared to the gas mass of the ER ( ≳6×10−2M⊙;
Mattila et al. 2010), this would imply a dust-to-gas mass ratio
evolving from ≲10−3(affected by the destruction of pre-existing
dust by SN radiation) to ≲10−2. The dust responsible for the hot-
ter component, on the other hand, is being destroyed faster than
the gas cools (Arendt et al. 2016); either small grains are evapo-
rated by ultraviolet (UV) photons, or large grains are destroyed
in grain-grain collisions. The properties of the dust created by
SN 1987A can shed light on the importance of SNe as dust pro-
ducers in galaxies (Indebetouw et al. 2014).
Any contribution of even hotter ER dust in the NIR has not
been well studied, and other sources also contribute to the NIR
emission, such as thermal free-free emission from shocked gas.
Much as in the optical (e.g. Fransson et al. 2013), numerous nar-
row emission lines can be seen in the ER spectrum (e.g. Kjær
et al. 2007), dominated by the shocked and unshocked dense
clumps that form the hotspots. Broader emission lines origi-
nate from collisionally excited ejecta material crossing the re-
verse shock. Synchrotron emission from material shocked by the
ejecta-ER interaction is dominant in the radio (e.g. Indebetouw
et al. 2014; Zanardo et al. 2014; Cendes et al. 2018), and while
the FIR-to-MIR flux of SN 1987A is dominated by dust, a syn-
chrotron spectrum continuing to the NIR might contribute to the
continuum there, and is allowed by reported FIR upper limits
(Cigan et al. 2019). These components may be disentangled by
studying the evolution of the morphology and spectrum of the
NIR emission.
In this paper, we study the morphology and flux evolution of
the ER at NIR wavelengths. We use image subtraction to com-
pare the morphology not only between epochs, but also between
wavelengths. We especially focus on the NIR continuum emis-
sion, which we isolate from and compare to the line emission as
well. We describe the data we use in Sect. 2; and our analysis
methods and results in Sect. 3. We discuss our findings in Sect.
4 and finally present our conclusions in Sect. 5. All uncertainties
in the paper correspond to 1 σunless otherwise noted.
2. Observations and data reduction
2.1. Imaging observations
We have used NIR imaging data of SN 1987A taken using
NAOS-CONICA (NACO; Lenzen et al. 2003; Rousset et al.
2003) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the European South-
ern Observatory (ESO) from 2006 to 2017. These observations
1This is the cold dust mass at ≳25 years. Only ≲10−3M⊙was claimed
to have condensed at 2 years post-explosion (Ercolano et al. 2007).are listed in Table 1. The NACO images were taken using AO in
theJ,H, and Ksbands. The NACO data from 2006 are from Pro-
gram 078.D-0322(A) (PI Danziger), obtained through the pub-
lic ESO Science Archive2; the data after 2006 are from Pro-
grams 086.D-0713(D), 088.D-0638(D), 090.D-0645(E), 094.D-
0505(D) and 096.D-0882(D) (PI Fransson). The individual ex-
posures were taken using a dithering (jitter) pattern of random
offsets within a 7-arcsec box around SN 1987A (8-arcsec for the
2006 images). Due to problems with the NACO detector caus-
ing correlated noise in two quadrants which resulted in strong
stripes in the images, a dithering pattern was selected for the
2017 observations to align the SN with the two better quadrants.
Star 2 (Walker & Suntze ff1990; Walborn et al. 1993) was used
as a natural guide star for the AO observations. The pixel scale
of the NACO images is 0.013′′/pixel and the field of view 14′′×
14′′. The full width half maximum (FWHM) angular resolution
is listed in Table 1 for each observation, but we note that the point
spread function (PSF) is not well modeled by a single Gaussian
due to extended “wings" common to AO observations.
We have also used public pipeline-reduced NIR images from
the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NIC-
MOS) and Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instruments aboard
theHST between 1997 and 2011 (GO 7434, 7821, 9428, 10549,
10867, 11653 and 12241; PI Kirshner). The HST/NICMOS im-
ages were taken using the filters F110W, F160W, and F205W
and obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes
(MAST) Portal3. The WFC3 images were taken using F110W
and F160W. The WFC3 images were drizzled (Fruchter & Hook
2002) with a pixel scale of 0.05′′/pixel in the final drizzled im-
age, while in NICMOS images the pixel scale is 0.025′′/pixel
in F110W and F160W and 0.05′′/pixel in F205W. In order to
compare the NIR morphology to that in the optical, we have
used images at epochs close to the NACO observations, taken
with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and WFC3 on
theHST. These images were taken using the F625W filter be-
tween 2006 and 2017 (GO 10867, 12241, 13181, 13810, PI Kir-
shner; and GO 14753, PI Fransson) and have a final pixel scale
of 0.025′′/pixel in the drizzled images. The HST images used in
this study are listed in Table 1 as well.
2.2. NACO image reduction
The NACO images were reduced with a combination of ESO
pipelines4and Image Reduction and Analysis Facility ( IRAF )5
tasks as described below. In some of the epochs, the images ex-
hibited a faint horizontal striping pattern, which was first re-
moved from each raw image with a custom IRAF script. For
this purpose, the script creates a one-dimensional image by tak-
ing the median of the pixel values along each image row. The
400 brightest pixels in each row were excluded from the median
to reduce the influence of bright stars. The 1D image was then
subtracted from the columns of the original image. The stripe
removal was skipped for images from 2015 as the final image
quality was not improved.
After the stripe removal, the exposures were sky-subtracted
in sets of three consecutive exposures to remove time-varying

artefacts in the exposures. For Nexposures numbered 1 ,...,N,
the sets were made out of exposures [1 ,2,3]; [2,3,4];...; [N−
2,N−1,N], yielding N−2 sets of three exposures. The sky
subtraction was carried out one set at a time using the ESO
pipeline recipe naco_img_jitter , which subtracts a sky frame
(the median of the three object frames) from each object frame,
aligns the exposures, and stacks them. The recipe yielded one
sky-subtracted image for every set of three exposures, N−2 in
total. The sky-subtracted images were aligned based on the cen-
troid coordinates of a manually selected star in each image. The
aligned images were stacked as the median of the images. The
sky-subtracted images were visually inspected and images were
rejected from the stacking at this step if either individual hotspots
or the ring as a whole were not visually discernible. Finally, we
ran the stripe removal script on the stacked image to remove any
bands or stripes left over by the previous steps. Figure 1 shows
a section of the final H-band image for the 2010 epoch as an ex-
ample, including the ER, the SN ejecta and nearby bright stars
– Stars 2 and 3 as in Walker & Suntze ff(1990); Walborn et al.
(1993), and a third star, referred to here as Star A. We also show
the sequences of ER evolution in all the NACO and NICMOS
images we use in this study in Figure 2. The WFC3 images have
a worse image quality and the evolution is not as apparent from
them, but for completeness we show them in Figure 3.
2.3. Integral field spectroscopy
We have also studied the ER using integral field unit (IFU)
data cubes from the Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observa-
tions in the Near Infrared (SINFONI; Bonnet et al. 2003; Eisen-
hauer et al. 2003) on the VLT. The SINFONI data we have used
here, taken in the Jband in 2005 and in the HKbands between
2005 and 2017, have been previously published in several papers
(Kjær et al. 2010; Fransson et al. 2016; Larsson et al. 2013, 2016,
2019). We summarize the basic relevant information in Table 2.
The data cubes were reduced (sky-subtracted, wavelength- and
flux-calibrated) using ESO pipelines and custom software; for
details on the observations and the reduction process, see theTable 1. Log of imaging observations used in this paper. In NACO im-
ages, the seeing FWHM corresponds to the AO-enhanced core of the
PSF.

smaller, inner aperture contained the ejecta in order to remove
its contribution. The position angles and sizes for both apertures
and the eccentricity for the inner aperture were selected to make
them match the shapes of the ER and the ejecta as closely as
possible6. The apertures are shown in Figure 4. For the NACO
images, the outer aperture had an eccentricity of 0.63, a semima-
jor axis of∼2.2′′, and a position angle of 7 degrees. The inner
aperture had an eccentricity of 0.7, a semimajor axis of ∼0.44′′,
and a position angle of 77 degrees. The eccentricity of the outer
aperture corresponds to an axial ratio of 0.78, which was chosen
to match the ratio found by Fransson et al. (2015). The pho-
tometry was carried out in Starlink GAIA . For the NICMOS and
WFC3 NIR images, the larger, outer aperture was also an ellipse
with an eccentricity of 0.63 and position angle of 7 degrees, but
a semimajor axis of ∼1.1′′as the PSF does not su ffer from AO
effects (bottom panel of Figure 4). The inner aperture had an ec-
centricity of 0.6, a position angle of 77 degrees, and a semimajor
axis of∼0.4′′.
The fluxes measured from the NACO images were calibrated
using known magnitudes of Star 2 (see Figure 1) from Walborn
et al. (1993), assumed to be constant, whereas the HST images
were flux-calibrated by the pipeline. Errors are not reported in
Walborn et al. (1993), and neither are individual NIR measure-
ments of Star 2, but those of the variable Star 3 are. The standard
error of the mean7of the Star 3 magnitudes – after subtracting
a linear fit to its decline – is between 0.015 and 0.033 mag de-
6Because of the evolving size of the ejecta, the inner aperture was
chosen to cover as much of the inner ejecta as possible in 2015 and
2017. The ejecta flux is around 10 per cent of the ER flux in the NACO
images, and any systematic e ffect from ejecta contribution in the ER is
small. We also point out that the broad wings of the PSF mean that a
small fraction of the ER flux is also within this inner aperture.
7We use this rather than the standard deviation, as for our NACO pho-
tometry we have to assume Star 2 is constant in brightness.Table 3. AB magnitudes of Star 2 at each NICMOS and WFC3 epoch,

pending on band; as Star 2 is of similar brightness, the precision
of its magnitude should also be similar. Considering that the de-
cline of Star 3 may not be exactly linear, we adopt 0.05 mag as
the uncertainty for Star 2 (i.e. J=15.09±0.05,H=15.08±0.05
andK=15.06±0.05, Vega). Star 2 might, however, conceiv-
ably vary in brightness on a longer timescale than that probed
by Walborn et al. (1993). The JHKs magnitudes of the star in
the Two-Micron All Sky Survey8(Skrutskie et al. 2006) are con-
sistent within 1 σwith the Walborn et al. (1993) magnitude. We
have also measured the AB magnitudes of Star 2 in the HST fil-
ters; these are listed in Table 3. With our assumed uncertainty,
the AB magnitudes of Star 2 based on Walborn et al. (1993) are
JAB=16.00±0.05,HAB=16.47±0.05 and KsAB=16.91±0.05;
the measured magnitudes in F110W, F160W and F205W, re-
spectively, stay close to these values from 1997 to 2011, but do
show some variation on the order of 0.1 mag over multiple-year
timescales (with one outlying epoch in 2006 in F160W), indicat-
ing the possibility of similar scatter in NACO JHKs fluxes.
The NACO images have PSFs characteristic to AO, where
the narrow, corrected PSF core is surrounded by a fainter, un-
corrected halo with broad “wings". The outer aperture was thus
spread far out from the ring to compensate for the PSF. To be
able to use a large aperture to measure the ER flux, nearby stars
(mainly Star 3 and Star A in Figure 1) needed to be removed
from the images. A PSF fit (using SNOoPY9) was made on the
three bright stars closest to the ring. The PSF model was then
subtracted from the stars in the image, leaving some residuals at
the locations of the removed stars. The residual from Star 3 was
removed by replacing the values of the residual pixels with the
mean value of the nearby background, measured from an annu-
lus around the residual, using the imedit task in IRAF .
In addition to the total fluxes from the ER, we have estimated
the continuum fluxes. We have determined the fraction of con-
tinuum emission contributing to the total flux at each epoch of
the SINFONI data, which we have in turn interpolated to cor-
rect the NACO fluxes. We extracted the spectrum at each SIN-
FONI epoch and band using QFitsView10, with an aperture cov-

ering the entire ER slightly farther out than in the NICMOS
photometry (excluding the ejecta region in a similar way) and
a sky extraction outside the ER. The semimajor axis was ap-
proximately 1 .3′′and the semiminor axis 1 .1′′, but as the ex-
traction region is set by eye in QFitsView , there is slight vari-
ation in the size of the region, on the order of 10 per cent (af-
fecting only the faint emission in the wings of the SINFONI
PSF). In each spectrum, we manually removed each clearly de-
tected emission line, down to the surrounding noise level. We
then interpolated the remaining continuum-dominated spectrum
using a Gaussian process (GP) regression algorithm (Rasmussen
& Williams 2006). We used the Python-based george package
(Ambikasaran et al. 2014), which implements various di fferent
kernel functions. Matérn kernels with νparameter of 3 /2 or 5 /2,
common in Gaussian process fitting, were used. We show an ex-
ample of a SINFONI H-band spectrum before and after this pro-
cess in Figure 5. The NACO JHKs filters were integrated over
the GP-interpolated continuum spectrum and the original, and
the ratio between the resulting fluxes is the fraction of contin-uum flux. The continuum fractions (CF) at each epoch and band
are listed in Table 4.
As is clear from Table 4, the continuum fraction does not
change much between 2005 and 2017, and the linear interpola-
tion of continuum fluxes at the NACO epochs is straightforward.
No extrapolation is needed as the NACO epochs all fall within
the 6830–11269 day range of the SINFONI observations. For
theJband observations, we assume the same fraction as esti-
mated for day 6830 at all epochs; this assumption is unlikely to
affect the results much considering the nearly constant CF at the
HKs bands. No continuum correction is performed for NICMOS
F110W and F205W data, as these filters are considerably wider
than the NACO ones, extending outside the SINFONI coverage
and thus presumably resulting in a di fferent CF that cannot be de-
termined from SINFONI data in the same way. We illustrate this
problem in Figure 6. F160W is closer to H, but no SINFONI data
exist for interpolating the CF before 6000 d. While the change
of the CF over time is slow or nonexistent over the NACO ob-
servations, assuming this for the NICMOS epochs as well is un-
founded, as the ER flux evolves faster over these epochs.
We have also used the SINFONI spectra to determine the
total and continuum flux density at those epochs. We have inte-
grated the normalized NACO JHKs filter functions over the GP-
fitted SINFONI continuum spectra described above. An assumed
10 per cent uncertainty from the flux calibration and another
10 per cent from extraction and line removal was included in
quadrature. The NACO and SINFONI fluxes do not fully agree,
as can be seen in Figure 7. A multiplication factor of ∼1.1,∼1.2
or∼0.9 must be included in order for the light curves to match
over the full span of the observations, depending on the band.
The SINFONI data are a ffected by similar concerns as NACO,
namely large PSF wings, which may have an e ffect in the ex-
traction of the spectrum, but this is not likely to explain the dif-
ference completely, and systematic flux calibration e ffects may
be more important. There are also di fferences between fluxes
measured from NICMOS and NACO images around 7200 d –
the NACO flux is lower in Jand higher in H. This is a ffected
by the di fferent filters, however, so the numbers especially in J
and F110W are not directly comparable, and the discrepancy be-
tween NACO and NICMOS is similar to that between NACO
and SINFONI only in H.
3.1.2. Photometry results
We apply the multiplication factors of 1.1 ( J), 1.2 ( H) and 0.85
(Ks) to fluxes measured from SINFONI, as in Figure 7, to match
the light curves as described above. Assuming this correction,
we list the ER flux densities in Table 5. We also show the light
curve and the evolution of the continuum flux density in the NIR
compared to the MIR (Arendt et al. 2016, 2020) in Figure 8.
The JHKs light curves peaked between 8000 and 9000 d (i.e.
roughly 2010–2012) and declined by about a third in the next
2500 d in HandKs. The optical light curve in Rpeaked around
day 8000 (2010) and in Bslightly later; they also declined by
roughly a third in the 3000 d after that. The rise toward the peak
is also similar in shape. The evolution of the NIR continuum
brightness after 7000 d resembles that in the MIR as well, espe-
cially in HandKs.
The di fference between NACO and HST filter functions
is apparent from the wildly di fferent light-curve evolution in
F110W and Jaround 2010 (∼8500 d) – the F110W flux reaches

11We have checked for problems in the absolute flux calibration of the
WFC3 /IR images compared to NICMOS or NACO, but the ratio of thedifference between these filters can be caused by strong emission
lines not included in the Jfilter (i.e. between 8000 and 11000 Å;
see Figure 6); the strongest of these is expected to be He iat
1.083µm (as the He i2.058µm line is the strongest emission line
we see in the K-band spectra), only a small fraction of which is
included in the NACO Jfilter. We do note that He ilines mea-
sured from our SINFONI spectra (see below) do not increase in
strength as drastically as the F110W flux does, but the 1.083 µm
line was previously noted to be much stronger than expected
based on other He lines, owing to di fferent excitation mecha-
nisms (Mattila et al. 2010). Recent JWST observations (Larsson
et al. 2023), with an extremely strong 1.083 µm line from the ER
and the RS, corroborate this. Both the soft X-ray (Frank et al.
2016) and H αemission (Fransson et al. 2015) rose by a similar
factor as F110W from ∼6000 to∼8000 d. We lack the data to
say whether the F110W flux kept rising past 9000 d, as did the
hard X-rays (Alp et al. 2021). The Hand F160W filters are much
closer in wavelength coverage, and the light curves in these fil-
ters are unsurprisingly much more similar as well.
ER flux and that of Star 2 is drastically di fferent in F110W and Jaround
2010 but not in 2006, eliminating this possibility.

3.2. Emission line fluxes
We have measured the fluxes of several narrow emission lines
in the SINFONI spectra – lines originating in both shocked and
unshocked matter in the ER (which we cannot distinguish be-
tween, but the former becomes dominant over time). As we lack
J-band spectra after 2005, we concentrate on lines in the other
bands. We list the measured line fluxes in Table 6. In each case,
the uncertainty is dominated by the assumed systematic errors
we ascribe to the flux calibration and the extraction of the spec-
trum. We show the evolution of the line fluxes compared to the
SINFONI continuum flux density in Figure 9.
The line fluxes mostly evolved similarly to the continuum
flux. There are slight variations in evolution between lines, with
the largest di fference between the [Fe ii] and Br 10 lines in the
Hband. The flux in all measured lines peaked in the 8708-day
spectrum, consistently with the continuum light curve. This is,
again, slightly later than in the optical: fluxes of H α, [O iii] and
[Fexiv] lines from the shocked ring reported by Fransson et al.
(2015) peaked around 8000 d or, in the case of [O iii], around
7000 d. The lines from unshocked matter were disentangled from
their high-resolution spectra, but their contribution to the total
flux is small and they peaked earlier; thus they do not account
for the delay between the NIR and optical peak.
3.3. Expansion velocity of the ER
We have used the NACO images to determine the size of the ER,
and its expansion velocity, in the Ksband where the hotspots can
be resolved most consistently. In 2017, on the other hand, the
NACO Ksimage is visibly of considerably worse quality thaninHwith fewer measurable hotspots, and we use Hinstead12.
We also use F160W on NICMOS, as these images have a better
angular resolution than F205W or the WFC3 NIR images (see
Table 1). The time baseline from our NACO images corresponds
to that in Larsson et al. (2019); they note that at earlier epochs the
size evolution is less linear, and thus epochs before 7000 d are
not used in our velocity fit. At each epoch, we have measured
the centroids of all visible hotspots and fitted an ellipse to the
centroid coordinates. The semimajor axis of the ellipse from this
fit has then been converted to physical sizes using a distance of
49.6 kpc to the LMC (Pietrzy ´nski et al. 2019).
We obtain a best-fit expansion velocity of 690 ±190 km s−1
since 2006 (∼7000 d); we show this fit in Figure 10. The size
evolution appears to have changed around this time in the opti-
cal. The measured sizes and the expansion velocity since 2006
are both in excellent agreement with the values measured from
optical hotspots by Larsson et al. (2019), who obtained a veloc-
ity of 680±50 km s−1. This velocity corresponds to the velocity
of shocks propagating through dense clumps in the ER. Before
2006 the optical hotspots may be located slightly further out than
in the NIR, but any di fference between the two is not significant.
In the MIR, on the other hand, Matsuura et al. (2022) measured
an expansion velocity of 3920 km s−1, with an initially smaller
extent of the MIR ring, but after ∼10000 d larger than in the
optical. This velocity tracks a more di ffuse emission than the op-
tical/NIR hotspots, however.
12The measured ER sizes are consistent between HandKswhen image
quality is similar, in 2006 and 2010, and between NICMOS F160W, H
andKsin 2006.

each case. For each subtraction, we used several stars in the field
to determine the kernel and the scaling factor, the exact number
depending on image quality, i.e. how many stars were visible.
We show the resulting subtraction images in Figures 11 and 12;
not all epochs are included here, depending on the time between
epochs and image quality.
The NICMOS subtractions mainly show the considerable
fading of the central ejecta between 1997 and 2002 and the
brightening of the ER. The minimum of the optical light curve
of the ejecta in fact occurred between these epochs, and it then
brightened until at least 2019 (see e.g. Larsson et al. 2019); how-
ever, the central peak of the ejecta still fades over time (and the
edges brighten) as the ejecta expands and becomes less centrally
peaked (Figure 2). The central fading can be seen later as well,
including the NACO subtractions, but less clearly, as the relative
change in ejecta morphology slows down over time.
Between 1997 and 2002, the brightening of the ER occurs
mostly on the north and east sides, and between 2002 and 2006,
more strongly on the west side. In the 2010 −2006 NACO sub-
traction, meanwhile, a stronger change is seen in the ER mor-
phology. The western half of the ER brightens considerably be-
tween 2006 and 2010, while the eastern half mostly declines.
As is apparent especially in the Hband, however, there is also
brightening indicating expansion at the easternmost edge. The
emission extends roughly equally far from the hotspot peaks on
both edges. In the following epochs, the J-band image qualityis much worse, but in the HandKsbands a steady decline can
be seen all over the ER, except for the ongoing expansion of the
ER resulting in a slight brightening toward the advancing edges.
A change in the east-west balance as noticeable as that between
2010 and 2006 is not seen afterward, and the ER stays skewed
to the west side, which can also be seen in Figure 2. The sub-
tractions between each epoch and 2006 show a similar timeline:
by 2017, the ER is only brighter than in 2006 at the western and,
to a lesser extent, eastern edge, indicating expansion. Fransson
et al. (2015) noted a similar evolution in the optical.
3.4.2. Line and continuum maps
We have constructed maps of the [Fe ii] 1.644µm line, the
Hei2.058µm line and Br γ. These were created from the data
cubes using QFitsView , subtracting the continuum immediately
surrounding the line. In order to study the spatial distribution of
the line flux compared to the continuum, we have also extracted
maps of the continuum redward of each line. The line maps were
constructed by including a range of wavelengths large enough to
include the di fferent velocities in di fferent parts of the ER (after
correcting for the recession velocity of 287 km−1; Gröningsson
et al. 2008); in the case of the [Fe ii] line we included 1.644–
1.647µm (±350 km−1), in He i2.0579–2.0640 µm (−350 to
550 km−1) and in Brγ2.1657–2.1718 µm (−350 to 550 km−1).
The continuum map was constructed by, respectively, only in-
cluding the wavelength ranges 1.652–1.655, 2.0677–2.0751 and
2.1743–2.1804 µm.
In order to study whether the distribution of the continuum
and line emission is the same, in each case we have normalized

the maps by matching the average surface brightness of all vis-
ible hotspots across the ER between them, then subtracted the
continuum from the line map. While the contribution of the con-
tinuum to the line map itself has already been subtracted, this
comparison clarifies the di fference between the spatial distribu-
tions – if the line and continuum originate from the same loca-
tions, the subtraction map is practically flat, but any significantpositive or negative di fferences indicate a di fferent spatial distri-
bution. We show the resulting maps in Figure 13. The continuum
flux gradually becomes stronger relative to the lines slightly out-
side the ER hotspots, as can be seen via the ring of negative flux
in the normalized and subtracted images by 2014, especially in
theK-band subtractions. Positive hotspots can be seen inside the
negative ring in 2014 and 2017, indicating a relatively higher

The contours illustrate the extent of the line emission, and positive fluxes indicate relatively stronger line emission than continuum. The influence

line emission contribution there compared to the region slightly
outside the ER. Before this, the extent of the lines is closer to
that of the continuum flux, resulting in the negative flux ring /
positive hotspot structure being less clear.3.4.3. Differences with optical
In order to study the di fferences between optical and NIR emis-
sion, we have used the HST F625W maps (mostly H αline emis-
sion) together with the Ks-band maps from NACO. We first per-
formed subpixel alignment, as previously described, between the
NIR images and the F625W images closest in time to them. We

omit the 2011 NACO epoch here, as the F625W images closest
to it in time match the 2010 and 2012 epochs much better and
are used in comparisons to them instead (see Table 1). We were
unable to use ISIS for subtraction, as the colors of the stars in
the image can be expected to vary considerably compared to the
ER, and they are thus unsuitable for scaling. We have, however,
used ISIS to convolve the image with the better seeing in a sim-
ilar fashion using field stars. We then used the peak counts of the
hotspots in the seeing-matched, aligned images to scale the im-
ages to each other, then finally subtracted the Ksimage from the
F625W image at a similar epoch. The resulting maps are shownin Figure 14. We also plot the Ks-band images overlaid with
contours corresponding to the F625W images in Figure 15.
A difference is visible in the Ks-band outer emission com-
pared to F625W, especially starting in 2013. A ring of Ks-band
emission is located outside the ER in the subtraction, similar to
those in the line-continuum subtractions. The di fference is less
clear in 2011 and especially 2006; the outer ER emission thus
relatively gains strength in the Ksband over time, suggesting
a faster expansion. The expansion velocities measured from el-
lipses fitted to hotspots are consistent (Figure 10), i.e. the dif-
ference is caused by di ffuse emission outside the hotspots. The
difference is not readily visible from the comparison of the Ks

images with the F625W contour maps, however – only the east-
ern di fference can barely be seen without the subtraction. The
eastern ER is less dominated by hotspots than the west, making
differences caused by other components more visible.
3.5. East vs. west fluxes
We have repeated our photometry for the east and west halves of
the ER separately in order to quantify the morphological evolu-
tion seen in the di fference images (Figure 12). We masked out
the other half in each NACO image, split at the geometric cen-
ter of the ER as measured using the flux peaks of the ER at the
western and eastern extremes, and repeated the measurement as
in Sect. 3.1. The resulting flux densities are listed in Table 7. The
east- and west-side light curves and east-west flux density ratios
are shown in Figure 16; east-west ratios are additionally listed
in Table 8. It is apparent that the east-west ratio changes consid-
erably between 2006 and 2010, similarly to what can be seen in
the di fference images, but stays fairly constant after 2010. Both
halves of the ER decline similarly after the light curve peak.
4. Discussion
4.1. NIR evolution vs. other wavelengths
Most aspects of the NIR evolution of the ER of SN 1987A follow
the optical evolution. The ER light curves in the optical and NIR
(and MIR when available) are quite similar, peaking close to the
same epoch (∼8500 d i.e.∼2010; Fransson et al. 2015; Lars-
son et al. 2019) in Jand slightly later in HKs , and declining at a
similar rate after that (Figure 8), indicating the same underlying
power source, i.e. the ejecta-ER interaction. The evolution of theER morphology resembles that in the optical as well (Fransson
et al. 2015), with the east-west asymmetry appearing around the
time of the light curve peak – the east side has been declining in
the optical since 7000–7500 days ( ∼2006–2007), and apart from
a slight brightening at the eastern edge of the ER due to expan-
sion, our subtractions show the same trend (Figure 12). Further-
more, the expansion of the ER as a whole is also proceeding at
the same rate as in the optical when measured from the centroids
of hotspots (Figure 10), i.e. within the hotspots themselves, the
locations of optical and NIR emission are practically identical.
The optical east-west ratio in 2006 was ∼0.9, but by 2010
it had decreased to ∼0.6, and by 2017 below 0.5 (Larsson et al.
2019). In the NIR, the east-west ratio decreases from 0.7–0.8 in
2006 to 0.5–0.6 since 2010, depending on wavelength. In the soft
X-rays (Frank et al. 2016), the ratio behaves somewhat similarly
to its optical and NIR equivalent: ∼1.1 in 2006,∼0.8 in 2010
and∼0.6 in 2015. This east-west evolution is also evident in the
MIR (Matsuura et al. 2022), with an increasing fraction of the
emission originating in the west over time after roughly 6500 d
(2005), albeit going from a ratio of ∼3 to∼0.8 instead. This is
in stark contrast with the radio (e.g. Zanardo et al. 2018), mil-
limeter (Indebetouw et al. 2014) and hard X-ray emission (Frank
et al. 2016), where the east side is the brighter one, especially
in terms of polarized radio flux (however, according to Cendes
et al. 2018, the radio asymmetry decreased over time and may
have reversed after ∼12000 d).
However, we see some di fferences to F625W and MIR emis-
sion as well. The di ffuse emission outside the hotspots in the
Ksband is seen to gradually become relatively stronger than in
F625W, as shown by the F625W −Ksmaps (Figure 14). This
only becomes apparent around 2013. As the expansion velocity
we measure is based on an elliptical fit to hotspots, this di fference
has little e ffect on the velocity measurement. A large fraction
of the emission in both bands originates in the hotspots, which
results in little visible di fference without the subtraction (Fig-
ure 15). The continuum contribution in the Ksband is around
75 per cent in our NACO images, whereas in F625W, the flux is
dominated by the narrow and broad components of H α(Frans-
son et al. 2013). This contributes to the observed di fference if
the extended emission in Ksis dominated by continuum, as Fig-
ure 13 indicates.
The expansion velocity of the di ffuse ring in the MIR is
several times higher than the hotspot expansion velocity in the
NIR and optical ( ∼3900 km s−1as opposed to∼700 km s−1;
Matsuura et al. 2022), which tracks shocks propagating through
dense ER clumps. This is nearly identical to the velocity in the
radio (Zanardo et al. 2013), while the X-rays run the gamut from
∼3100 km s−1in>2 keV X-rays (Frank et al. 2016), through
∼1900 km s−1between 0.5 and 2 keV , to consistent with zero
(or even with slow shrinking) in the 0.3–0.8 keV band. The MIR
ring was initially smaller than in the NIR before about 10000 d
(∼2014), when it caught up to the extent of the hotspots, and
larger afterward. However, the more di ffuse NIR emission com-
ponent outside the hotspots, responsible for the seemingly larger
extent of the ER compared to the optical, may track this faster
expansion. Even so, despite the similar light curve, most of the
NIR emission thus seems to originate in a di fferent location than
the 180 K dust that dominates the MIR (or the X-ray-emitting
shocked gas, except for the softest X-rays).
In the MIR, the brightness di fference is associated with a
shift in temperature: the dust on the east side was hotter in 2005
and on the west side in 2017 (Matsuura et al. 2022), possibly
because of a density di fference, which could also explain the
stronger NIR /optical emission from the interaction on the west

verse shock is largest on the southeast side, the faintest section
of the ER with the fewest visible hotspots in our images, indicat-
ing a lower density there.
4.2. The properties of the NIR continuum
The continuum consistently forms a majority of the total NIR
emission from the ER between 6800 and 11300 d (2005–2017),
and possibly earlier as well. We have showed that the spatial
extent of the continuum emission is not identical to the line
emission. Hotspots in the ER are responsible for much of both
the lines and the continuum emission, as is apparent from our
images, the lack of evolution in the CF and hence the similar-
ity of the continuum and line emission light curves (see Fig-
ure 9). However, the continuum is relatively stronger outside the
hotspots than the line emission as well Figure 13. This, together
with the larger CF in the NIR than in the optical as mentioned
above, indicates that the di fference between F625W and NIR,
with NIR emission similarly being stronger beyond the hotspots,
is specifically caused by the continuum emission.
The MIR continuum of the ER is dominated by 180 K silicate
dust (Dwek et al. 2010), collisionally heated by gas which itself
is heated by the ejecta-ER interaction and subsequently emits
X-rays. Emission from such collisionally heated dust should
thus follow the X-ray evolution, but the MIR /X-ray flux ratio
(and, similarly, the NIR /X-ray ratio) lessens over time, indi-
cating destruction of dust by sputtering (i.e. dust-gas collisions
within shocked gas that return the dust grain material into the
gas phase). An additional hotter component is also seen with
T≳350 K. Arendt et al. (2016) fit this component with 525-K amorphous carbon dust, which is being destroyed over time
faster than the gas cools – either by UV photons or by grain-
grain collisions, depending on the grain size. These components
are not responsible for most of the JHKs emission, however –
nor are they spatially coincident with it.
We have performed blackbody fits to the continuum flux den-
sities in the MIR (Arendt et al. 2020) and NIR to investigate an
additional component that may be present in the NIR – assum-
ing only one dominant continuum source. This is likely not true,
as in addition to blackbody emission, thermal bremsstrahlung
and nonthermal emission can contribute. We fit two blackbody
components, the cooler of which is fixed at 525 K (Arendt et al.
2016). We show these fits and their temperature uncertainties in
Figure 17. We do not include the J-band fluxes, as it is clear
from the figure that one blackbody is not su fficient to fit all NIR
bands. We use both NACO and SINFONI epochs, but include a
correction factor in the latter as described in Sect. 3.1. Finally,
we introduce a 10 per cent uncertainty in the MIR fluxes, which
otherwise would be weighted much more heavily than the NIR
fluxes in the fit. The temperature of the hotter blackbody compo-
nent in the resulting fits ranges between 1800 and 2800 K. The
individual photometric points show some scatter (see e.g. Fig-
ure 8), and some epochs (e.g. around 9000 d) are a ffected by a
small dip in Ks-band fluxes (possibly due to slight color vari-
ation in Star 2), resulting in the highest blackbody fit tempera-
tures. The rest cluster at 1800–2400 K, close to the evaporation
temperature of graphite grains (Guhathakurta & Draine 1989).
Small-grain dust that is being destroyed over time by photo-
evaporation could be evident in the NIR data through a black-
body component at a relatively constant (and high) temperature.
Grain destruction within the ER could also increase the relative
contribution of the outer emission. Despite the expanding dif-
fuse component, most of the NIR continuum is coming from
the hotspots, i.e. dense ER clumps, and expanding slower than
the MIR continuum emission. Both the warm and hypothetical
hot dust would likely have been formed in the same mass loss
episode(s) – however, di fferences in their location could arise af-
ter the SN as graphite grains could survive in hotter locations,
and the collisional heating of the dust becomes more e fficient in
the high-density clumps (e.g. Matsuura et al. 2022). This could
result in a higher relative prevalence of hot graphite dust in the
clumps compared to cooler silicate dust.
Assuming that the NIR is dominated by dust, we can esti-
mate the dust mass similarly to Fox et al. (2010) using their Eq.

2, from which we obtain Md=FνD2/(Bνκ), where Mdis the dust
mass, Fνthe continuum flux density, Bνthe fitted hot blackbody
component and κa mass absorption coe fficient, a function of the
grain size and the frequency. With a grain size of 0.1 µm (below
∼0.1µm the size has a minimal e ffect onκ) we estimate that a hot
dust mass on the order of only ∼1–4×10−12M⊙could account
for the entire HKs continuum, depending on the epoch – this
range corresponds to the scatter in blackbody temperatures. For
comparison, Arendt et al. (2016) estimated the stronger 525 K
component to originate from roughly 0.5 per cent of the total
dust mass in the ER, which, assuming a total of 10−5M⊙at
8000 d (Matsuura et al. 2019), amounts to ∼5×10−8M⊙– we
obtain a value of∼2×10−8M⊙from the 525 K graphite compo-
nent in our blackbody fit around the same epoch. Matsuura et al.
(2022) obtained a similar estimate of ∼10−8M⊙. A low mass
of graphite dust is not surprising based on the low carbon abun-
dance in the CNO-processed ER (Lundqvist & Fransson 1996).
Since the 525 K component is both stronger and cooler than the
NIR continuum (therefore having a much larger emitting area)
and has a lower κ(Fox et al. 2010), the ∼2000 K dust mass is
orders of magnitude lower still.
However, the J-band continuum flux is clearly a ffected by
another component as well; this component can also extend into
theHband. The component is already visible in 2006, when the
F110W /Jratio is lower than at later times, making it unlikely to
be simply the He i1.083µm line at the edge of the Jfilter. The
temperature fits above assume that there is only one continuum
component in HandKsand no contribution from e.g. blended
weak lines, thermal bremsstrahlung from gas either at the ER
or the reverse shock, or a broad-line component from the latter.
The blackbody fit is a ffected in reality by these additional com-
ponents. The Hband is more densely filled with lines than the Ks
band, which makes it more di fficult to disentangle broad reverse-
shock lines from the continuum; thus the e ffect of reverse-shock
lines would be expected to be higher in H, which can increase
the apparent blackbody temperature. It is likely that the contin-
uum includes a reverse-shock +weak-line component as well.
The reverse shock flux in optical lines is a nonnegligible frac-
tion of the total line flux (Fransson et al. 2013, 2015). Thermal
bremsstrahlung from gas at ≳10000 K, typical for the dense ER
clumps (e.g. Orlando et al. 2019), on the other hand, could have
a flat spectrum across the HKs bands, which would also distort
the temperature from a blackbody fit by increasing the relative
contribution in the weaker band (and thus usually the tempera-
ture, as this band tends to be H). This component may contribute
significantly to the total NIR flux, albeit less so in J. As a result,
the dust mass we obtain is an upper limit only.
Synchrotron emission from the forward or reverse shock may
contribute as well. It plays an important role in the radio and, to
a lesser extent, FIR (e.g. Cendes et al. 2018; Cigan et al. 2019).
Its extension into NIR (which would be strongest in Ks) is a can-
didate for a relatively fast-expanding di ffuse continuum compo-
nent. Extrapolating the synchrotron spectrum from ALMA fre-
quencies to the NIR with a ν−0.7power law (Cigan et al. 2019),
one obtains a flux density of ∼0.1 mJy (strongest in the Ksband:
∼0.13 mJy) at 9280 d, around the peak of the NIR light curve.
This is roughly a third of the continuum flux in the NIR at that
epoch. The radio fluxes have increased until at least 11000 d
(2017), implying that the synchrotron component at the post-
peak epochs can constitute even more than a third of the NIR
continuum flux. The e ffect of a synchrotron contribution would
be largest in Ks, decreasing the apparent blackbody tempera-
ture (i.e. possibly o ffsetting the e ffects of bremsstrahlung and
the weak /broad lines on it). This, however, assumes no break

frequency in the spectrum between 1 and ∼800µm. The ER is
not visible in the FIR images of Indebetouw et al. (2014), but
the upper limits shown in Cigan et al. (2019) do not constrain
whether such a break is present.
Lundqvist et al. (2020) used an observed break frequency
and the age of the SN remnant SNR 0540-69.3 to estimate its
magnetic field; we can similarly estimate that a break frequency

c(Pachol-
czyk 1970), where τis the lifetime of the synchrotron-emitting
electrons. With τ≈15 yr (at 9280 d, since about the beginning
of the ER-ejecta interaction) and νc>3×1014Hz, correspond-
ing to 1µm, we obtain B≲1.8 mG. Berezhko et al. (2011)
argued that ≳10 mG was required to produce the observed
radio and X-ray spectrum at 20 yr. This would translate into
νc∼6×1011Hz (∼500µm, roughly the lowest value allowed by
Cigan et al. 2019) and an insignificant synchrotron component
in the total NIR emission. However, Petruk et al. (2022), based
on the Orlando et al. (2019) models, place the magnetic field
strength much lower than 1 mG in the hotspots and beyond, al-
lowing the synchrotron spectrum to continue unbroken through
the NIR. Even in the Berezhko et al. (2011) scenario, regions

of low magnetic field may still contribute, and we note that the
continuum “ring" outside the hotspots clearly does not dominate
the total continuum emission either.
5. Conclusions
We have examined the morphology of the equatorial ring (ER) of
the remnant of SN 1987A in the near-infrared (NIR), its evolu-
tion over time, and di fferences between the NIR and other wave-
lengths. We have also attempted to isolate the continuum and line
emission from the ER and examined di fferences in morphology
between them. Our conclusions are as follows.
–The evolution of the NIR morphology broadly follows that
seen in the optical, with a similar light curve, expansion
speed as measured from hotspots ( ∼700 km s−1), and a de-
creasing east-west brightness ratio. However, the NIR emis-
sion at later epochs is stronger outside the ring defined by the
hotspots than in F625W (but still weaker than the hotspots),
hinting at a faster-expanding di ffuse component.
–Although the line and continuum emission follow similar
light curves, the continuum emission is similarly stronger
outside the hotspots than line emission in the later epochs.
This indicates that the continuum is responsible for the outer
emission not seen in the optical.
–Continuum emission constitutes a majority of the total flux
in the NIR in all bands and at all epochs, but not all bands
can be simultaneously fitted using a blackbody function. If
theHKs -band continuum is dominated by dust, its temper-
ature is in the vicinity of 2000 K from 2005 to 2017. The
location of this hypothetical hot dust would also be di fferent
from the warm dust dominating in the mid-infrared, which
expands much faster and is more di ffuse in morphology. This
dust does not dominate in the Jband, however, and thermal
bremsstrahlung is also expected to contribute; thus the mass
of any hot dust is not more than a few ×10−12M⊙– orders of
magnitude below the warm dust mass.
–Synchrotron emission can contribute significantly to the NIR
continuum in regions where the magnetic field is below
∼2 mG, especially in the Ksband. It cannot dominate the full
NIR continuum emission in the ER, which mostly originates
in the hotspots, but can be the source of the outer continuum
emission.
With the recent launch of the JWST with its superior spatial
resolution and sensitivity, the community is now able to study
the ER and other regions in the remnant of SN 1987A in greater
detail. These observations will no doubt cast more light on the
different emission components in the NIR and allow for better
constraints on their origins.
