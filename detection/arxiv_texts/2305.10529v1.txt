Abstract. Letb≥2be an integer. We show that the set of real numbers that are Poi sson
generic in base bisΠ0
3-complete in the Borel hierarchy of subsets of the real line. Further-
more, the set of real numbers that are Borel normal in base band not Poisson generic in
basebis complete for the class given by the diﬀerences between Π0
3sets. We also show that
the eﬀective versions of these results hold in the eﬀective B orel hierarchy.

1.Introduction and statement of results
Years ago Zeev Rudnick introduced Poisson generic real numb ers: a real number xis Poisson
generic in an integer base b≥2, if the counts of number of occurrences of words of length k
over the alphabet {0,1,...,b−1}appearing in the initial segments of the base bexpansion of
xtends to the Poisson distribution with parameter λask→ ∞ for every λ >0. That is, we
look at the fraction of kwords appearing a given number of times among the ﬁrst digits tends
in distribution to the Poisson distribution with parameter λask→ ∞. Peres and Weiss [12]
proved that Lebesgue almost all real numbers are Poisson gen eric. Their proof is presented
in [3, Theorem 1]. Poisson genericity implies (Borel) normal ity.
For the rest of the paper, given an integer b≥2, we identify real numbers in the unit
interval[0,1)with their base bexpansions, that is, we identify each x∈[0,1)with a sequence
x1x2x3...with values in {0,1,...,b−1}such that
x=∞/summationdisplay
j=1xj
bj
andxj/\e}atio\slash= 0for inﬁnitely many j≥1. All real numbers in [0,1)have at least one, and for all,
but countably many real numbers the base bexpansion is unique.
In the sequel we consider an integer b≥2that we take as the given base. For a real number
xand an interval A= [q,r]of real numbers (respectively A= [q,r)), where 1≤q < r we write
x↾Ato denote the segment of the base- bexpansion of xcorresponding to positive integers in
the interval A. Many times instead of writing x↾[1,r]for some r >1we write we write x↾r
to denote the initial segment of the base bexpansion of xup to position ⌊r⌋.
Since Poisson genericity in base bis a property that depends only of the tail of the base b
representation of that real number, the integer part of the n umber is irrelevant. Thus, we
present our results just for the real numbers in the unit inte rval, but they also hold when the
unit interval is replaced by the real line.

Deﬁnition (Poisson generic number) .Letλbe positive real number. A real number x∈[0,1)
isλ-Poisson generic in base bif for every non-negative integer jwe have
lim
k→∞Zλ
j,k(x) =e−λλj
j!,
where
Zλ
j,k(x) =1
bk|{w∈ {0,...(b−1)}k:woccursjtimes in x↾λbk+k}|.
A real number xis Poisson generic in base bif it isλ-Poisson generic in base bfor every
positive real λ.
LetPbbe the set of real numbers that are Poisson generic in base b. It is easy to see that Pb
is a Borel set. Our goal is to give the descriptive complexity o fPb. In other words, we would
like to locate the exact position of Pbin the Borel hierarchy (both, lightface and boldface).
Recall that the Borel hierarchy for subsets of the real number s is the stratiﬁcation of the
σ-algebra generated by the open sets with the usual topology. For references see Kechris’s
textbook [10].
A setAisΣ0
1if and only if Ais open and AisΠ0
1if and only if Ais closed. AisΣ0
n+1if
and only if it is a countable union of Π0
nsets, and AisΠ0
n+1if and only if it is a countable
intersection of Σ0
nsets.
A setAis hard for a Borel class if and only if every set in the class is r educible to Aby a
continuous map. A set Ais complete in a class if it is hard for this class and belongs t o the
class. By Wadge’s celebrated theorem, in spaces like the real numbers with the usual interval
topology, a Σ0
nset isΣ0
n-complete if and only if it is not Π0
n.
When we restrict to intervals with rational endpoints and co mputable countable unions
and intersections, we obtain the eﬀective or lightface Borel hierarchy. One way to present
the ﬁnite levels of the eﬀective Borel hierarchy is by means of the arithmetical hierarchy of
formulas in the language of second-order arithmetic. Atomi c formulas in this language assert
algebraic identities between integers or membership of rea l numbers in intervals with rational
endpoints. A formula in the arithmetic hierarchy involves o nly quantiﬁcation over integers.
A formula is Π0
0andΣ0
0if all its quantiﬁers are bounded. It is Σ0
n+1if it has the form ∃xθ
whereθisΠ0
n, and it is Π0
n+1if it has the form ∀xθwhereθisΣ0
n.
A setAof real numbers is Σ0
n(respectively Π0
n) in the eﬀective Borel hierarchy if and only
if membership in that set is deﬁnable by a formula which is Σ0
n(respectively Π0
n). Notice that
everyΣ0
nset isΣ0
nand every Π0
nset isΠ0
n. In fact, for every set AinΣ0
nthere is a Σ0
nformula
and real parameter such that membership in Ais deﬁned by that Σ0
nformula relative to that
real parameter.
A setAis hard for an eﬀective Borel class if and only if every set in th e class is reducible
toAby a computable map. As before, Ais complete in an eﬀective class if it is hard for this
class and belongs to the class. Since computable maps are con tinuous, proofs of hardness in
the eﬀective hierarchy often yield proofs of hardness in gen eral by relativization.
The diﬀerence hierarchy over a pointclass is generated by ta king diﬀerences of sets. In the
sequel we are just interested in the class D2-Π0
3which consists of all the sets that are diﬀerence
between two sets in Π0
3. The class D2-Π0
3is the eﬀective counterpart.
Although the deﬁnition of Poisson genericity in a given base basks forλ-Poisson genericity
in basebfor every positive real λ, it suﬃces to consider λ-Poisson genericity in base bfor
every positive rational λ. This is proved in Lemma 3. Then, by the form of its deﬁnition, the
setPbis aΠ0
3property, hence Pbis a Borel set appearing as Π0
3set in the Borel hierarchy.THE DESCRIPTIVE COMPLEXITY OF THE SET OF POISSON GENERIC NUM BERS 3
We shall prove completeness. We ﬁrst prove the boldface case , and then we add the needed
subtleties to prove the lightface case. We start with the fol lowing result.
Theorem 1. PbisΠ0
3-complete.
Deﬁnition (Borel normal number) .Let an integer b≥2. A real number xis Borel normal
in basebif for every block wof digits in {0,...(b−1)},
lim
n→∞the number of occurrences of winx↾n
n=b−|w|.
The setPbof real numbers that are Borel normal in base bisΠ0
3-complete [6, 11]. Every
real Poisson generic in base bis Borel normal in base b, see [12] or [5, Theorem 2]. We study
the descriptive complexity of the diﬀerence set. Let Nbbe the set of real numbers that Borel
normal in base b.
Theorem 2. Nb\PbisD2-Π0
3-complete.
The next two results are the lightface improvements of Theor ems 1 and 2.
Theorem 3. PbisΠ0
3-complete.
Theorem 4. Nb\PbisD2-Π0
3-complete.
Similarly to previous consequences of diﬀerences sets of no rmal numbers for Cantor series
expansions being D2-Π0
3-complete [2], Theorem 2 imposes limitations on the relatio nship
between NbandPb. An immediate consequence of Theorem 2 is that the set Nn\ Pbis
uncountable. Also, since Nb\ PbisD2-Π0
3-complete, there cannot be a Σ0
3setAsuch that
A∩Nb=Pb(as otherwise, we would have Nb\Pb=Nb\A∈Π3
0, a contradiction). Thus,
noΣ0
3condition can be added to normality to give Poisson generici ty. Equivalently, any time
aΣ0
3set contains Pb, it must contain elements of Nb\ Pb. As an application, consider the
following deﬁnition of weakly Poisson generic:
Deﬁnition (Weakly-Poisson generic number) .Sayx∈[0,1)with base bexpansion (xj)is
weakly Poisson generic in base bif for every ǫ >0, every rational λ, and non-negative integer j,
we have that for inﬁnitely many kthat|Zλ
j,k(x)−e−λλj
j!|< ǫ.
Note that being Poisson generic in base bimplies being weakly-Poisson generic. However,
being weakly-Poisson generic is a Π0
2condition. So, from Theorem 2 we get the following:
Corollary 1. For every base bthere is a base- bnormal number which is weakly Poisson
generic but not Poisson generic.
As another application, consider the following version of d iscrepency. Suppose fis a
function assigning to each word w∈b<ωand each positive integer na positive real num-
berf(w,n). Given x∈[0,1)with base bexpansion (bj), say the (w,n)-discrepancy is
D(x,w,n) =|n
b|w|−W(x↾n,w)|, whereW(u,w)is the number of occurrences of winu.
We say a real number xhas base b f-large discrepancy if for all wand allnwe have that
D(x,w,n)> f(w,n). The set of xwithf-large discrepancy, for any ﬁxed f, is easily a Π0
1
set. The set of numbers that are Borel normal to base bare exactly those for which the
discrepancy of their initial segments of their expansion in basebgoes to zero. We conjecture
that the Poisson generic numbers in base bcan not have very low discrepancy of their initial
segments (for instance, the inﬁnite de Bruijn sequences exis t in bases b≥3, they satisfy that
Z1
1,k= 1for every k, hence they do not correspond to Poisson generic numbers, an d they have4 V. BECHER, S. JACKSON, D. KWIETNIAK, AND W. MANCE
low discrepancy.) However, we have the following, which sta tes that the Poisson generic reals
cannot be characterized as the set of normal numbers satisfy ing a large discrepancy condition.
Corollary 2. For every function f, the set of base- bPoisson generic reals is not equal to the
set of normal numbers with f-large discrepancy.
There are also many other naturally occurring sets of real nu mbers are deﬁned by conditions
which make them Σ0
3. Examples include countable sets, co-countable sets, the c lass BA of
badly approximable numbers (which is a Σ0
2set), the Liouville numbers (which is a Π0
2set), and
the set of x∈[0,1]where a particular continuous function f: [0,1]→Ris not diﬀerentiable.
In all these cases, the theorem implies that either the set om its some Poisson generic number,
or else contains a number which is normal but not Poisson gene ric. Of course, many of these
statements are easy to see directly, but the point is that the y all follow immediately from the
general complexity result, Theorem 2.
The set of real numbers whose expansion in every integer base is Poisson generic is of
courseΠ0
3, but we do not know yet how to prove that this set is Π0
3-complete. The set of
real numbers whose expansion in one base is λ′-Poisson generic but not λ′-Poisson generic, for
diﬀerent positive real numbers λandλ′, isD2-Π0
3but we do not know if it is complete.
The result in the present note contribute to the corpus of wor k on the descriptive complexity
of properties of real numbers that started with the question s of Kechris on the descriptive
complexity of the set of Borel normal numbers. He conjectured that set of absolutely normal
numbers (normal to all integer bases) is Π0
3(R)-complete. Ki and Linton [11] gave the ﬁrst
result towards solving the conjecture by showing that the se t of numbers that are normal to
base2isΠ0
3-complete. Then V. Becher, P. A. Heiber, and T. A. Slaman [4] se ttled Kechris’
conjecture. Furthermore, V. Becher and T. A. Slaman [8] prove d that the set of numbers
normal in at least one base is Σ0
4(R)-complete. In another direction, D. Airey, S. Jackson,
D. Kwietniak, and B. Mance [1] and, more generally K. Deka, S. J ackson, D. Kwietniak, and
B. Mance in [9] showed that for any dynamical system with a weak form of the speciﬁcation
property, the set of generic points for the system is Π0
3-complete. This result generalizes the
Ki-Linton result to many numeration systems other than the s tandard base bone. In general,
the Cantor series expansions are not covered in this general ity, so D. Airey, S. Jackson, and B.
Mance [2] determined the descriptive complexity of various sets of normal numbers in these
numeration systems.

We write µfor the Lebesgue measure on the real numbers. From Peres and W eiss metric
theorem [12, 3] asserting that µ-almost all real numbers in the unit interval are Poisson gen eric
in each integer base b, we have the following.
Forµalmost all real numbers xin the unit interval the following holds. Fix an integer base

stepiin the construction of f(z)for such an i. For any ǫ >0, ifiis large enough then the
number of words wof length kiwhich occur in x↾[1,(1−1

f(z)is not1-Poisson generic.
Next suppose that z∈ C. We show that f(z)is Poisson generic in base b. Fixλ >0and

For the proof of Theorem 2 we require the following two lemmas .
Lemma 1. Fix an integer b≥2. Almost all real numbers in (0,1)have the property that for
anyαof the form α=1
2ℓwe have
lim
i→∞1
bki|Hi|= (1−e−α)(e−(1−α)),
whereHiis the set of words of length kiwhich occur in the base- bexpansion of xwith a starting
position [(1−α)bki,bki), but do not occur with a starting position in [bki−1,(1−α)bki].
In fact, this claim holds for any xwhich is Poisson generic in base b.
Proof. Letx∈(0,1)be Poisson generic in base band ﬁxαa negative power of 2. Let
•Aibe the set of words of length kioccurring in [bki−1,bki).
•Cibe the set of words of length kioccurring in [bki−1,(1−α)bki)).
ClearlyCi⊆Ai. The words which occur in [(1−α)bki,bki)but not in [bki−1,(1−α)bki))
are exactly the words which occur in Aibut notCi.
Let
•A′
ibe the set of words that occur in [1,bki)
•C′
ibe the set of words that occur in [1,(1−α)bki).
Then
||Ai\Ci|−|A′

i|| ≤bki−1.
Sincexis Poisson generic in base b, for any ǫ >0we have that for all large enough ithat

Similarly, as xis Poisson generic in base b, and using λ= 1−α, we have that

A standard probability computation shows the following.
Lemma 2. There is a function g:ω→ωsuch that the following holds. Suppose k0< k1<···
are such that bki−bki−1> g(i−1)for alli. Thenµ-almost all x∈(0,1)satisfy the following:
for anyj∈ω, anyw∈bjand any ǫ >0, for all large enough i, and any n > g(i−1)

whereW(s,w)is the number of occurrences of the word wins.
Proof. We can take g(n) =n. Fixjandw∈bj, and ﬁx ǫ >0. It suﬃces to show that for
almost all xthat for all large enough iand any n > g(i−1) =i−1that
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1
nW(x↾[bki−1,bki−1+n),w)−1
bj/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle< ǫ.
There are constants α,β >0such that for all n, the probability that a string s∈bnviolates
the inequality |1

We can now give the proof of the D2-Π0
3completeness of the diﬀerence set Nb\Pb.
Proof of Theorem 2. We ﬁx a suﬃciently fast growing sequence k0< k1<···as in Lemma 2,
and then ﬁx x∈(0,1)to be Poisson generic in base b(so that Lemma 1 holds) and also to be
in the measure one set where Lemma 2 holds for this sequence (ki)i≥0.
We letC={z∈ωω:z(2n)→ ∞} , andD={z∈ωω:z(2n+ 1)→ ∞} . We deﬁne a
continuous map f:ωω→(0,1)which reduces C\DtoNb\Pb. The idea to deﬁne fso that
forz∈ωω, the even digits z(2i)will control whether f(z)∈ Nband the odd digits z(2i+1)
will control whether f(z)∈ Pb. When we wish to violate Poisson genericity, we will do so for
λ= 1andj= 0. We may assume without loss of generality that all z(i)and allkiare positive
powers of 2.
As before, at step iwe deﬁne f(z)↾Bi, whereBi= [bki−1,bki). Let8 V. BECHER, S. JACKSON, D. KWIETNIAK, AND W. MANCE

We show that fis a reduction from C\DtoNb\Pb.
First assume z /∈C, that isz(2i)does not tend to ∞. Fixℓsuch that z(2i) =ℓfor inﬁnitely
manyi. We easily have that f(z)/∈ Nb. For example, if the digit 0occurs with approximately

This is because f(z)↾Bi

So we may henceforth assume that z∈C, so1
bki|B2

z(2i)→0. We observe that this
implies that f(z)∈ Nb. This follows from Lemma 2 and that we may assume limig(i−1)
bki−1= 0.
Now assume that z∈D, soz /∈C\D. We show f(z)∈ Pb, and so f(z)/∈ Nb\Pb. Since
we are assuming z∈Calso, we have limi→∞z(i) =∞. So,limi→∞1
bki(|B2

then follows exactly as in Equation 1 in the proof of Theorem 1 thatf(z)∈ Pb.
Assume next that z /∈D(butz∈Cstill). We show that f(z)/∈ Pb, which shows f(z)∈
Nb\Pb. Fixmso that for inﬁnitely many iwe have z(2i+1) =m, and we may assume m
is of the form m= 2ℓ. Recall1

by the construction of f(z)we have that every word which occurs in [(1−α)bki,bki)also occurs

The following algorithm is an adaptation of Turing’s algori thm for computing an absolutely

Poisson generic in base bwe need the following lemma.

The classical total variation distance dTVbetween two probability measures PandQon a

For a random variable Xtaking values in R, the distribution of Xis the probability measure µX
onRdeﬁned as the push-forward of the probability measure on the sample space of X.
The total variation distance between two random variables XandYis simply dTV(X,Y) =
dTV(µX,µY).Hence, the total distance variation

bk#(N∩bk[λ,λ′)) =λ′−λ+O(b−k).
Also observe that dTV(Po(λ′),Po(λ))→0asλ→λ′. From these two observations and the
fact that the rational numbers are a dense subset of the real n umbers we conclude that being
λ-Poisson generic for every positive rational λimplies Poisson generic. /square
The proofs of Theorems 3 and 4 are very similar to those of Theo rems 1 and 2. However
we now include what is needed to prove the lightface results. We now start we a computable
Poisson generic number in base bthat we obtain with the Algorithm above, and we computably
determine the sequence of values (ki)i≥1using the input sequence z∈ωω.
Proof of Theorem 3. LetC={z∈ωω: limi→∞z(i) =∞}. So,CisΠ0
3-complete. We deﬁne
a computable map f:ωω→(0,1)which reduces CtoPb. Fixz∈ωω. At step i, letki
be the least integer such that ki> ki−1, andki> z(i). Fixk0= 0. Fori >0, we deﬁne
f(z)↾[bki−1,bki)as follows. Let
Bi:= [bki−1,bki)
B′
i:=/bracketleftBig
bki−1,/parenleftBig

z(i)/parenrightBig
bki/parenrightBig
.
We set
f(z)↾B′
i:=x↾B′
i,andf(z)↾Bi\B′
i:= 0.
First suppose z /∈ C, and ﬁx ℓ∈ωsuch that for inﬁnitely many iwe havez(i) =ℓ. Consider
stepiin the construction of f(z)for such an i. For any ǫ >0, ifiis large enough then the
number of words wof length kiwhich occur in x↾[1,(1−1
z(i))bki]is at most
bki(1−e−(1−1
z(i))+ǫ).
Then, the number Ziof words wof length kiwhich occur in f(z)↾bkiis at most
bki(1−e−(1−1
z(i))+ǫ).
So,
1
bkiZi≤(1−e−(1−1
ℓ)+2ǫ).
On the other hand, the Poisson estimate for the proportion of words of length kioccurring
in an initial segment of length bkiis1−1/e. Since ℓis ﬁxed, as igets large we have a
contradiction. So, f(z)is not1-Poisson generic n base b.THE DESCRIPTIVE COMPLEXITY OF THE SET OF POISSON GENERIC NUM BERS 13
Next suppose that z∈ C. We show that f(z)is Poisson generic in base b. Fix a positive
rationalλandǫ >0. Consider any k∈ω, large enough so that the following holds:
Letibe such that ki−1≤k < ki,
•ifλ=p
qthenki−1≥q,
•ki>1
ǫ,
•for alls≥i−1we have1
z(s)< ǫ.
We show that for any such k, and for every non negative jless than bk,
|Zλ
j,k(f(z))−e−λλj
j!|< ǫ. First consider the case λ≤1. Fixj. We have that

forilarge enough. We have used here the fact that |Zλ
j,k(f(z))−Zλ
j,k(x)|is at most the number
of words of length kwhich appear in one of f(z)↾bk,x↾bkbut not the other. Such a word
must overlap the block of 0s inf(z)↾[bki−1(1−1
z(i−1)),bki−1), or else overlap [1,bki−2], which
gives the above estimate.
Consider now the case λ >1. Ifλbk< bki(1−1
z(i)), then the same estimate above works.
So, suppose bk≥1
λbki(1−1
z(i)). In this case we also count the number of words wof length k
which might overlap the block of 0s inf(z)↾[bki(1−1
z(i)),bki]. We then get

We can now prove the D2-Π0
3-completeness of the diﬀerence set Nb\Pb.
Proof of Theorem 4. The proof is exactly as that of Theorem 2 except that we start w ith a
computable real xand we determine the sequence (ki)i≥1using the input sequence z∈ωω.
Letxbe the number obtained by the Algorithm.
LetC:={z∈ωω:z(2n)→ ∞} andD:={z∈ωω:z(2n+1)→ ∞} . We assume without
loss of generality that all z(i)are powers of 2. We deﬁne a computable map f:ωω→(0,1)
which reduces C\DtoNb\Pb. Fixz∈ωω. At step i, letkibe the least power of 2such that
ki> ki−1, andki> z(i). We deﬁne fso that for z∈ωω, the even digits z(2i)will control
whether f(z)∈ Nband the odd digits z(2i+1)control whether f(z)∈ Pb. When we wish to
violate Poisson genericity, we do so for λ= 1andj= 0.14 V. BECHER, S. JACKSON, D. KWIETNIAK, AND W. MANCE
As in the proof of Theorem 2, at step iwe deﬁne f(z)↾Bi, whereBi= [bki−1,bki). Let

Notice that |B2

We show that fis a reduction from C\DtoNb\Pb. First assume z /∈C, that isz(2i)does
not tend to inﬁnity when igoes to inﬁnity. Fix ℓsuch that z(2i) =ℓfor inﬁnitely many i. We
easily have that f(z)/∈ Nb. For example, if the digit 0occurs with approximately the right
frequency1
binf(z)↾[0,bki−1+|B1
i|) = [0,bki(1−1
z(2i)−1
z(2i+1))), then0will occur with too

We use here that1

k<ibk→0. This is because f(z)↾Bi

ℓbkifor such i.
Now assume that z∈C, so1
bki|B2
i|=1
z(2i)→0. Then, we have f(z)∈ Nb. This follows
from the the deﬁnition of fand the fact that by that xis Borel normal to base b, see [5,
Theorem 2].
Assume ﬁrst that z∈D, soz /∈C\D. We show f(z)∈ Pb, and so f(z)/∈ Nb\Pb. Since
we are assuming z∈Calso, we have limi→∞z(i) =∞. So,limi→∞1
bki(|B2
i|+|B3
i|) = 0. It
then follows exactly as in the proof of Theorem 3 that f(z)∈ Pb.
Assume next that z /∈D(butz∈Cstill). We show that f(z)/∈ Pb, which shows f(z)∈
Nb\ Pb. Fixmso that for inﬁnitely many iwe have z(2i+ 1) =m, andmis of the form
m= 2ℓ. Recall1
bki|B3
i|=1
z(2i+1)=1
2ℓfor such i. We restrict our attention to this set of iin
the following argument: If f(z)were Poisson generic, then from Lemma 1 we would have that
for large enough iin our set that
1
bki|Hi|= (1−e−α)(e−(1−α)),
whereHiis the set of words of length kiwhich occur in f(z)with a starting position in
[(1−α)bki,bki), but do not occur in xwith a starting position in [bki−1,(1−α)bki). However,
by the construction of f(z)we have that every word which occurs in [(1−α)bki,bki)also
occurs in [bki−1,(1−α)bki), and so |Hi|= 0. This completes the proof of Theorem 4. /square
