Abstract
In this short note, we show that the higher-order derivative s of the adjugate matrix Adj (z−A), are related
to the nilpotent matrices and projections in the Jordan deco mposition of the matrix A. These relations appear
as a factorization of the derivative of the adjugate matrix a s a product of factors related to the eigenvalues,
nilpotent matrices and projectors. The novel relations are obtained using the Riesz projector and functional
calculus. The results presented here can be considered to be a generalization of Thompson and McEnteggert’s
theorem relating the adjugate matrix to the orthogonal proj ection on the eigenspace of simple eigenvalues for
symmetric matrices. They can also be seen as a complement to s ome earlier results by B. Parisse, M. Vaughan
that relate derivatives of the adjugate matrix to the invari ant subspaces associated with an eigenvalue. Our
results can also be interpreted as a general eigenvector-ei genvalue identity. Many previous works have dealt
with relations between the projectors on the eigenspaces an d the derivatives of the adjugate matrix with the
characteristic spaces but it seems that there is no explicit mention in the literature of the factorization of the
higher-order derivatives of the adjugate matrix as a matrix multiplication involving nilpotent and projector
matrices, which appear in the Jordan decomposition theorem .
Keywords— Riezs projector, adjugate matrix, Cauchy integral form, Jo rdan normal form, root subspaces.
1. Introduction and main results
LetA∈Cn×nbe a square complex matrix of order nand denote its adjugate matrix by Adj (A). We recall a result of
Thompson and McEnteggert ([ 1,2,3,4]) which states that for a Hermitian matrix Awhose characteristic polynomial is
p(z), ifλiis a simple eigenvalue of Aandziis a corresponding unit eigenvector, then
Adj(λi−A) =dp(z)
dz/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

i. (1)
This means that Adj (λi−A)is a scalar multiple of the orthogonal projection on the char acteristic eigenspace related to
λi. Denote by nithe (algebraic) multiplicity of the eigenvalue λi, where 1 ≤i≤mandmis the total number of distinct
eigenvalues. It is also known that the matrix
dni−1Adj(z−A)
dzni−1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
λi
spans the root (characteristic) subspace associated with λi. See [ 5] and the references therein. In this short article, we
extend and unify these two observations. In particular, we e xtend ( 1) to the case of repeated eigenvalues, higher derivatives
and general matrices. We also show that the higher-order der ivatives of the adjugate matrix Adj (z−A), are related to the
nilpotent matrices and projections in the Jordan decomposi tion of the matrix A. The following factorization is obtained in
Section 3,

less than or equal to ni(Nni
i=0). On the other hand, Piis the oblique projection on the root subspace associated wi th
λi. It satisﬁes P2
i=Pand the columns of Pispan the root subspace. For Hermitian matrices Ni=0, thus, we recover the
result of Thompson and McEnteggert. In the general case, we c an write

j/negationslash=i(z−λj)nj/parenrightigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle

which is a nilpotent matrix of degree less than or equal to ni. The matrix Niis related to the action of Arestricted to
the root subspace associated with the eigenvalue λi. Furthermore, we discuss additional related results. Amon g them, we
prove that for all iand 0 ≤s < n i−1, we have

j/negationslash=i(Ni+λi−λj)njPi.
This formula is consistent with ( 2) when s=ni−1 and Ni/ne}ationslash=0. Note that the above novel identities relate the eigenvalu es
ofA,{λj}j=1,...,m, the eigenvectors - as Pispans the root spaces associated with λi- and the derivatives of the cofactors
evaluated at the eigenvalue λi. As a result, these identities can be interpreted as general izedeigenvector-eigenvalue identities .
For an overview of eigenvector-eigenvalue identities, see the survey in [ 6]. It is observed that [ 6] derives eigenvector-eigenvalue
identities via various methods, including the formula ( 1) by Thompson and McEnteggert.
The following sections of the paper are organized as follows . Section 2presents background material and related previous
work. Section 3contains a detailed presentation of our main results. Secti on4provides some illustrative examples, and
Section 5concludes this document with ﬁnal remarks.
2. Preliminaries and related works
LetA∈Cn×nbe a complex matrix and let Γ⊂Cbe a positively oriented rectiﬁable Jordan curve ([ 7, chapter 3, pp 68])
that does not contain eigenvalues of Aand encloses a region D. Then, the Riesz projector is deﬁned as, see [ 8, chapter 1,
pp 3-6]
PΓ=1
2πi/contintegraldisplay
Γ(z−A)−1dz. (3)
When Dcontains only one eigenvalue of A, say λi, the Riesz projector is denoted by Pλior just by Piwhen there is no
ambiguity. Observe also that z−Adenotes the matrix zIn−Awhere In∈Cn×nrepresents the identity matrix. It is
worth noting that when Ais Hermitian, Pλrepresents an orthogonal projection onto the eigenspace as sociated with λ. The
Riesz projector has many interesting properties and it can b e deﬁned in more general Banach spaces, see [ 9, chapter 11, pp
418-425][ 10, pp 273–275][ 11, chapter 2, pp 63-64] and references therein.
Another important integral used in this document is the Cauc hy integral formulation for matrix functions. Suppose
that f(z)is an analytic function inside and on a closed contour Γwhich encloses the entire spectrum of A. Then we have,
see [12, chapter 6, pp 427, Theorem 6.2.28][ 13, chapter 9, 528, 529][ 14, chapter 1, pp 2-4],
f(A) =1
2πi/contintegraldisplay
Γf(z)(z−A)−1dz. (4)
The complex matrix (z−A)−1, if it exists, is known as the resolvent of Aand denoted as R(z) =R(z,A).
Theadjugate matrix of A, which is denoted by Adj A, is the complex matrix having entries as (AdjA)ij= (−1)i+jMji(A),
where Mji(A)is the(j,i)minor of A. Here, the minor means the determinant of the (n−1)×(n−1)submatrix obtained
by deleting the j-th row and the i-th column from matrix A. The adjugate of a matrix satisﬁes th e following relation ([ 15,
Theorem 2, pp 119])
A(AdjA) =det(A)In. (5)
2Let us introduce the characteristic polynomial of Aas follows:
pA(z) =p(z) =det(z−A) =zn+α1zn−1+· · ·+αn−1z+αn. (6)
It follows from equation ( 5) that if the complex matrix z−Ais invertible,
B(z)≡Adj(z−A) = ( z−A)−1p(z). (7)
Throughout the rest of this text, the notation B(z)will be used to abbreviate Adj (z−A).
It is well known that every square complex matrix Aadmits a Jordan decomposition. When Ais diagonalizable, the
Jordan decomposition reduces to diagonalization. The Jord an canonical form is usually introduced in the following way . Let
Abe a complex square matrix of order nand{λi}1≤i≤mrepresent the mdistinct eigenvalues of A, each with an algebraic
multiplicity of ni, 1≤i≤m. The characteristic polynomial p(z)can be expressed as
p(z) =m/productdisplay
i=1(z−λi)ni.
Recall that if his a positive integer, we denote by Ih∈Ch×hthe identity matrix of size h×h. The root subspaces {Wi}1≤i≤m
corresponding to each eigenvalue λican be deﬁned as Wλi=Wi=Ker(A−λi)ni, along with the corresponding projections
Pionto the spaces Wi. Then there exists a matrix Vsuch that A=V JV−1, where Jis a block diagonal matrix, see [ 16,

We have the following result (see [ 16,15,12]).

Note that if Ais a diagonalizable matrix (e.g., Hermitian matrices), we t hen have Ni=0 for 1 ≤i≤m.
Coming back to the adjugate matrix, in [ 5], B. Pairisse and M.Vaughan express
B(z) =zn−1+zn−2C1+· · ·+zCn−2+Cn−1 (11)
and ﬁnd a method based on the Faddev Algorithm in order to comp uteCℓ, 1≤ℓ≤n−1, using the recurrence relation

ofAin (6), that is,
αℓ=−1
ℓtr(ACℓ−1),ℓ=1, 2,. . .,n−1. (13)
They also write the expansion centered around a given eigenv alue, say λi,

Note that
dni−1B(z)

λi= (ni−1)!Bni−1(λi).
Concerning this expansion they show that Span (Bni−1)is the root space associated with λi, i.e., the subspace Wiin our
notation; see [ 5, Theorem 2]. Additionally, they propose an algorithm to com pute the Jordan canonical form that we
summarize here as follows. Given a matrix A, proceed as follows:
1. Compute the matrices C1,C2,. . .,Cn−1and the coeﬃcients of the characteristic polynomial α1,α2,. . .,αmusing the
Faddev Algorithm for matrix A(see ( 12) and ( 13)).
2. Compute the matrices Bk(λi), 0≤k≤n−1 and 1 ≤i≤n. This could be done using the Horner division of B(z)
(and its derivatives) by z−λi. Another alternative is to compute them directly from the Fa ddev algorithm for A−λi.
3. Compute the corresponding eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors from the matrices Bk(λi).
This last step requires joint and careful columnwise Gauss e limination for all the matrices Bk(λi)that preserves the following
structure,
(A−λIn)B(λi) = 0
(A−λIn)B1(λi) = B(λi)

4In this manuscript, we present a diﬀerent proof of some of the se results using the Riesz projector. Furthermore, it is
also found that Bni−1is proportional to the projection to the root space Wi. Additionally, the matrix Niis expressed in
terms of the derivatives of B, that is, it is provided a matrix representation of the nilpo tent matrix of the Theorem 2.1. As
a related result, we mention that recently in [ 17] M. Franchi has shown some relations between the Riesz proje ction and
the Jordan structure of a matrix.
3. Higer order derivatives of the adjugate matrix
In order to prove our main results, ﬁrst, based on formula ( 7), let us express (A−z)−1in terms of the matrices PiandNi,
1≤i≤m. For this, we need the following general algebraic lemma.
Lemma 3.1. Let{Xi}iand{Yi}ibe families of matrices such that [Xi,Yi] =0andXiis invertible, for all i.

We still need some additional results. The following result relates the complex Cauchy integral of f(z)R(z)with the
matrices NiandPi. Recall that analytic functions evaluated on the matrix can be deﬁned with the integral form of Cauchy
(4); see [ 14]. Similar results are obtained when the contour Γdoes not enclose the entire spectrum, as if the function were
restricted to the subspaces Wiof the eigenvalues enclosed by Γ. We present complete proof for the sake of completeness.
Theorem 3.2. Letf(z)be an analytic function and let Γr⊂Cbe a positively oriented rectiﬁable Jordan curve that does
not contain eigenvalues of Aand encloses a region Drcontaining only one eigenvalue λrofA. Then

Note that with these results and ( 4), we have that

and
f(A)Pr=f(λr+Nr)Pr.
This is expected because the root subspace Ker (A−λi)niisA−invariant, f(A)−invariant and f(APi) =f(A)Pi, see [ 16,
Theorem 3.3.1]. Thus, Theorem 3.21says that1

Before stating some results, let us deﬁne

j/negationslash=i(z−λj)nj, (15)

qi(λi) =1

The previous theorem can be applied taking into account the e quation ( 7), and we can obtain the following result.
Theorem 3.3. LetB(z)be deﬁned in (7)andqibe deﬁned in (15). Then, for 0≤s < n i−1
dsB(z)
dzs/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
λi=s!Nni−1−s
iqi(Ni+λi)Pi. (17)
In addition, when s=ni−1, we have
dni−1B(z)
dzni−1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
λi= (ni−1)!qi(Ni+λi)Pi. (18)
Proof. We know that
B(z) =p(z)(z−A)−1= (z−λi)niqi(z)(z−A)−1(19)
and therefore,
B(z)
(z−λi)s+1= (z−λi)ni−1−sqi(z)(z−A)−1. (20)
Since B(z) =Adj(z−A), each one of its entries is a cofactor of z−Aand hence B(z)is an analytic function (see also
(11)). Then, applying the Cauchy formula to the left-hand side o f (20) and the Theorem 3.2to the right hand side, we get
equations ( 17) and ( 18).
Note that in the previous theorem, if ni=1, then there is no integer s, such that 0 ≤s < n i−1 and the equation ( 17)
cannot be applied. However, equation ( 18) is still valid. Furthermore, the reason why equation ( 18) is not a particular case
of the former is that it does not make sense when Ni=0 and s=ni−1.
We also have the following interesting observation on the ra nk of the derivatives of the adjugate matrix. Since the only
distinct eigenvalue of qi(Ni+λi)isqi(λi)/ne}ationslash=0, then qi(Ni+λi)is an invertible complex matrix. Therefore, for integers
0≤s < n i−1, Theorem 3.3implies that

where {ni,k}k=1...giare the partial multiplicities corresponding to the eigenv alueλiand # represents the cardinality of the

We conclude that the rank of the ﬁrst ni−1 derivatives of the adjugate matrix does not decrease with t he order of the

λi.
Note that if the geometric multiplicity giofλiis such that gi≥2, then the degree diofNisatisﬁes di≤ni−1.
Therefore, Nni−1
i=0. Thereby, taking s=0 in the previous theorem in equation ( 17) we obtain the well-known fact ([ 4])
Adj(λi−A) =0 . (21)
We can generalize this result as follows. Let ni=max 1≤k≤gini,kbe the maximum partial multiplicity of λiand let
ni=min 1≤k≤gini,kbe the corresponding minimum partial multiplicity. Theref ore, if 0 ≤s≤n1−1−nithen Nni−1−s
i=0.
Therefore, by equation ( 17),dsB(z)
dzs/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
λi=0. In addition, it holds for all ssuch that 0 ≤s≤(gi−2)ni−1, when the
corresponding geometric multiplicity gi≥2. Since ni(gi−1)≤ni−ni, see ( 8). We have the following results.
7Corollary 3.3.1. LetAbe a n×nsquare matrix, λian eigenvalue of A. Let niandgibe the algebraic and geometric
multiplicities of λi, respectively. Let kiandnibe the maximum and minimum partial multiplicities of λi, respectively. If s
is an integer such that 0≤s≤ni−1−ni, then
dsAdj(z−A)
dzs/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
λi=0. (22)
In particular, if gi≥2and0≤s≤ki(gi−1)−1, then the equation (22)holds.
Now, when the geometric and algebraic multiplicities coinc ide (e.g., every eigenvalue of a diagonalizable matrix), th en
the nilpotent matrix Niassociated with λiis the zero matrix, and we have the following results.
Corollary 3.3.2. LetAbe a n×nsquare matrix, B(z) =Adj(z−A),λian eigenvalue of Awith geometric multiplicity
equal to the algebraic multiplicity ni, then for every integer 0≤s < n i−1, we have
dsB(z)

•IfAis hermitian and λiis a simple eigenvalue, with a unit eigenvector zi, then

As before, when Ais Hermitian and λiis simple, then ni=1,Ni=0 and rank (Pi) = 1, hence Pihas a matrix
representation of the operator ziz∗
i, and the formula is reduced to the one of the Thompson and McEn teggert Theorems
stated next.

For this result, we refer to [ 1,2,3]. See also [ 4] for a generalization of this identity to include any matrix with entries
in an arbitrary ﬁeld that is stated as follows. Let λibe a simple eigenvalue of a matrix Awith right and left eigenvectors
viandzi, respectively. Then ( [ 4, Remark 2.10.]),

Observe that1

iis an oblique projection on viin the direction orthogonal to zi. Theorem 3.3includes this case
since ni=1 implies Ni=0 and rank (Pi) =1. In this case, Piis an oblique projection in the space generated by the as-
sociated eigenvector vi. The extension of the results to a more general algebraic set ting (as in [ 4]) will be presented elsewhere.
For the following discussion, assume that λihas geometric multiplicity gi=1 and ni>1. Then there is only one
Jordan block associated with λiand only one, up to scaling, right (and also one left) eigenve ctor. Select arbitrarily viand

We have u∗

Thus we have recovered, for the particular case of complex ma trices, the result stated in [ 4, p. C. 2.8]. Finally observe
that α2(u∗

Example 4.3for an illustrative example.
Corollary 3.4.1. LetA∈Cn×n. Suppose that λiis an eigenvalue of Awith geometric multiplicity gi=1and algebraic
multiplicity ni>1. Let vi,uibe corresponding right and left eigenvectors of A, with eigenvalues λiandλ∗
i. In addition, let
xi,yibe generating right and left eigenvectors of viandui. respectively. Then
Adj(λi−A) = ( −1)ni−1qi(λ)viu∗

Moreover, the left and right vectors are orthogonal, that is ,v∗
iui=0.
To ﬁnish this section we express PiandNiin terms of the derivatives of B(z)andqi(z). Considering f(z) =1 and
applying Theorem 3.2, we have
Pi=1
2πi/contintegraldisplay
Γi(z−A)−1dz=1
2πi/contintegraldisplay
ΓiB(z)
(z−λi)niqi(z)=1
(ni−1)!dni−1
dzni−1/parenleftbiggB(z)
qi(z)/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
λi.
Ifni=1, then Ni=0. However, if ni≥2, taking f(z) =z−λiand applying Theorem 3.2, then,
Ni=1
2πi/contintegraldisplay
Γi(z−λi)(z−A)−1dz=1
2πi/contintegraldisplay
ΓiB(z)
(z−λi)ni−1qi(z)=1
(ni−2)!dni−2
dzni−2/parenleftbiggB(z)
qi(z)/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
λi.
Hence we have the following result.
Theorem 3.5. LetB(z)be deﬁned in (7)andqibe deﬁned in (15). Then
Pi=1
(ni−1)!dni−1
dzni−1/parenleftbiggB(z)
qi(z)/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
λi. (30)
Moreover, if ni≥2, then
Ni=1
(ni−2)!dni−2
dzni−2/parenleftbiggB(z)
qi(z)/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
λi. (31)
Therefore, one can recover the matrices PiandNifrom the derivatives of cofactors terms. Therefore we can co mpute
functions f(A)with ﬁnite polynomials because of the fact that Niis nilpotent.
4. Illustrative examples
In this section, we present particular illustrative exampl es to help the reader to ﬁx ideas related to the results presen ted in
the previous section. The code can be found in https://github.com/jrubianom/Jordan_From_Derivative s.
94.1. Example 1
Let A be the following hermitian matrix
A=
1−1 1
−1 1 −1
1−1 1
. (32)
The characteristic polynomial is p(z) = z2(z−3). Then the eigenspace related with λ=0 has dimension 2 and the
eigenspace related with λ=3 has dimension 1. The adjugate matrix is
B(z) =
z2−2z −z z
−z z2−2z −z
z −z z2−2z

and its derivative is written as
B′(z) =
2z−2 −1 1
−1 2 z−2 −1
1 −1 2 z−2
.
Evaluating B′(z)atz=0 we get

One can check the following relations
P0+P3=In,P0P3=P3P0=0 , P2
0=P0,P2
3=P3,AP0=0AP3=3P3andA=3P3+0P0.
These relations are basically the spectral theorem for this speciﬁc matrix. Note that Tr (P0) =2 and Tr(P3) =1, i.e, the
dimensions of the eigenspaces, as it should be (the trace of a projection is the dimension of its range). See [ 18,19].
As a remark related to our results, we observe that the Jordan canonical form for this matrix is given by
V=
1−1 1
1 0 −1
0 1 1
 and J=
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 3

We verify with the eigenvectors corresponding to the ﬁrst ei genvalues, V0=V(:,[1, 2])that, P0=V0∗(VT
0V0)−1VT
0and
with V3=V(:, 3)that P3=V3∗(VT

10The characteristic polynomial is p(z) =(z−1)2(z+1)2. The root space related to λ=1 has dimension 2, the same for
λ=−1. The adjugate matrix is given by
B(z) =

Since the algebraic multiplicity is 2 in both cases, we compu te the ﬁrst derivative of B(z/q1(z)that is given by,

We verify P1=VI1V−1andP−1=VI−1V−1.
Analogously, we obtain NiPi=/parenleftigB(z)

We have veriﬁed the following relations,

As an example of a function of A,

125. Final Comments
In this manuscript, we obtained explicit formulas relating higher order derivatives of the adjugate matrix Adj (z−A)to
the Jordan decomposition of the matrix A. See Theorem 3.5. To obtain these identities we used the Riesz projector and
some results from functional calculus. The results present ed here can be considered a generalization of the Thompson
and McEnteggert theorem that relates the adjugate matrix wi th the orthogonal projection on the eigenspace of simple
eigenvalues for symmetric matrices. See [ 1,2,3]. It can also be regarded as a generalized form of some identi ties in
[4]. They can also be viewed as a complement to some previous res ults by B. Parisse, M. Vaughan in [ 5] that related
derivatives of the adjugate matrix with the invariant subsp aces associated with an eigenvalue. Additionally, the form ulas
can be regarded as general eigenvector-eigenvalue identit y, see [ 6]. Although this method for obtaining the eigenvectors
from derivatives of the cofactors of A−zand the nilpotent matrices of the Jordan decomposition (in t he base generated
by the eigenvectors) may not be eﬃcient from a numerical poin t of view, it may be useful for symbolic computations or
theoretical purposes. Further generalization of the main r esults of this paper over other ﬁelds than complex may be carr ied
out in the future. Applications of the techniques developed here to other problems in linear algebra related to function al
calculus and invariant subspaces are the subject of current research.
