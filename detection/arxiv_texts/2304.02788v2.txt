1.Introduction
In this article, we introduce the notion of calibrated geome try for smooth
maps between Riemannian manifolds and consider the lower bo und or the
minimizers of several energy of smooth maps. Let ( X,g) and (Y,h) be a
compact Riemannian manifolds and f:X→Ybe a smooth map. Then the
p-energy offis deﬁned by
Ep(f) :=/integraldisplay
X|df|pdµg
forp≥1, whereµgis the volume measure of g. A harmonic map is deﬁned
to be a critical point of E2, and the study of it is one of the signiﬁcant region
in diﬀerential geometry. In 1964, Eells and Sampson [4] have s hown that
there is a harmonic map f′homotopic to fif the sectional curvature of h
12 K. HATTORI
is nonpositive. Moreover, Hartman [5] showed that such harm onic maps
minimize E2|[f], where [f] is the homotopy class represented by f.
In general, harmonic maps need not minimize the energy. For e xample,
although the identity maps on any Riemannian manifolds are a lways har-
monic, it is known that there is a smooth map fεhomotopic to the identity
map such that E2(fε) =εon then-sphereSnwith the standard metric and
n≥3. By the resultshown by White [10], if πl(X) is trivial for all 1 ≤l≤k,
then infEk|[1X]= 0, where 1 Xis the identity map of X.
Now, we consider how to give the lower bound to the energy rest ricting to
a given homotopy class [ f] and the minimizer of them. Such a lower bound
was ﬁrst obtained by Lichnerowicz [8] in the case of ( X,g) and (Y,h) are
K¨ ahler manifolds, then it was shown that any holomorphic ma ps between
K¨ ahler manifolds minimize E2in their homotopy classes. Moreover, Croke
[3] showed that the identity map on the real projective space with the stan-
dard metric minimize E2in its homotopy class, then Croke and Fathi [2]
introduced the new homotopy invariant called the intersect ion, which gives
the lower bound to E2|[f]for a given homotopy class [ f]. Recently, Hoising-
ton [7] give the lower bound to Epfor an appropriate pin the case of Xis
real, complex, or quaternionic projective spaces with the s tandard metrics.
In this article, we generalize the notion of calibrated geom etry to smooth
maps between smooth manifolds and give the lower bound to the several
energy. The origin of calibrated geometry is the Wirtinger’ s inequality for
the even dimensional subspaces in hermitian inner product s paces [11], then
it reﬁned or generalized by many researchers. In [6], Harvey and Lawson
deﬁned calibrated submanifolds in the Calabi-Yau, G2orSpin(7) manifolds
which minimize the volume in their homology classes. Simila rly, we de-
ﬁne the new class of smooth maps, called calibrated maps, and show that
they minimize the appropriate energy for the given situatio n. Moreover, we
obtain the next results as applications.
The ﬁrst application is to obtain the lower bound to p-energy restrict-
ing to the given homotopy class. We assume Xis oriented. The pullback
offinduces a linear map [ f∗]k:Hk(Y,R)→Hk(X,R). By ﬁxing basis
ofHk(X,R),Hk(Y,R), we obtain the matrix P([f∗]k) of [f∗]kand put
|P([f∗]k)|:=/radicalbig
tr(tP([f∗]k)·P([f∗]k)).
Theorem 1.1. Let(X,g)and(Y,h)be as above. For any 1≤k≤dimX,
there is a positive constant Cdepending only on k,(X,g),(Y,h)and the
basis ofHk(X,R),Hk(Y,R)such that for any f∈C∞(X,Y)we have
Ek(f)≥C|P([f∗]k)|.
In particular, if [f∗]kis nonzero, then inf(Ek|[f])is positive.
In the above theorem, the compactness of Yis not essential. See Theorem
4.2.
The second application is to show that the identity maps of so me Rie-
mannian manifolds with special holonomy groups minimize th e appropriateSMOOTH MAPS MINIMIZING THE ENERGY 3
energy. As we have already mentioned, the identity map on the real or
complex projective space minimize E2in its homotopy class by [3] and [8],
respectively. It was shown by Wei [9] that the identity map on the quater-
nionic projective space HPnwith the standard metric is an unstable critical
point of Epfor 1≤p <2 + 4n/(n+ 1). Moreover, Hoisington gave the
nontrivial lower bound of Ep|[1HPn]forp≥4. Here, the quaternionic pro-
jective space is a typical example of quaternionic K¨ ahler m anifolds, which
are Riemannian manifolds of dimension 4 nwhose holonomy group is con-
tained inSp(n)·Sp(1). Now, let Abe ann×mreal-valued matrix and
denote by a1,...,a m∈Rthe nonnegative eigenvalues oftAA, then put
|A|p:= (/summationtextm
i=1ap/2
i)1/p. Moreover, we deﬁne an energy Ep,qby
Ep,q(f) :=/integraldisplay
X|df|q
pdµg,
then we have Ep=E2,p.
Theorem 1.2. Let(X,g)be a compact quaternionic K¨ ahler manifold of di-
mension 4n≥8. Then the identity map of Xminimizes E4,4in its homotopy
class.
We can also show the similar theorem in the case of other holon omy
groups. If ( X,g) is a compact G2manifold, then 1 Xminimizes E3,3|[1X]and
if (X,g) is a compact Spin(7) manifold, then 1 Xminimizes E4,4|[1X](See
Theorem 5.6). Moreover, it is easy to see that if the identity map minimizes
Ep,q, then it also minimizes Ep′,q′for allp′≥pandq′≥qby the H¨ older’s
inequality. Of course, we can also consider the case of K¨ ahl er, Calabi-Yau,
hyper-K¨ ahler manifolds respectively, however, the resul ts in these cases also
follow from [8].
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we deﬁne the notion of
calibrated maps, which is the analogy of the calibrated subm anifolds. In
Section 3, we explain some examples of calibrated maps. In pa rticular, we
show that holomorphic maps between K¨ ahler manifolds and th e inclusion
maps of calibrated submanifolds can be regarded as calibrat ed maps. More-
over, we can also show that the ﬁbration whose regular ﬁbers a re calibrated
submanifolds are calibrated maps. We prove Theorem 1.1 in Se ction 4, and
Theorem 1.2 in Section 5. In Section 6, we compare the homotop y invariant
introduced in [2] with the invariants deﬁned in this paper.

2.Calibrated maps
LetX,Ybe smooth manifold of dim X=mand dimY=n. Throughout
of this paper, we suppose Xis compact and oriented. We ﬁx a volume form
vol∈Ωm(X) onX, namely, a nowhere vanishing m-form which determines4 K. HATTORI
an orientation and a measure of X. Form-formsv1,v2∈Ωm(X), there are
ϕi⊂C∞(X) withvi=ϕivol. Then we write v1≤v2ifϕ1(x)≤ϕ2(x) for
allx∈X.
If a mapσ:C∞(X,Y)→L1(X) is given, then we can deﬁne an energy
E:C∞(X,Y)→Rby
E(f) :=/integraldisplay
Xσ(f)vol.
Now,f0,f1∈C∞(X,Y) are said to be homotopic if there is a smooth
mapF: [0,1]×X→Ysuch thatF(0,·) =f0andF(1,·) =f1. By Whitney
approximation theorem, it is equivalent to the existence of the continuous
homotopy joining f0andf1. Forf∈C∞(X,Y), denote by [ f]⊂C∞(X,Y)
the homotopy equivalent class represented by f. In this paper we consider
the lower bound to E|[f]or the minimum of E|[f].
Denote by 1 X:X→Xthe identity map on X. We deﬁne a smooth map
(1X,f):X→X×Yby
(1X,f)(x) := (x,f(x)).
The next deﬁnition is the analogy of [6].
Deﬁnition 2.1. Φ∈Ωm(X×Y) is aσ-calibration ifdΦ = 0 and
(1X,f)∗Φ≤σ(f)vol
for any smooth map f:X→Y. Moreover, fis a (σ,Φ)-calibrated map if
(1X,f)∗Φ =σ(f)vol.

ticular, any (σ,Φ)-calibrated map minimizes Ein its homotopy class.
Proof.(i) Iff0,f1are homotopic, then (1 X,f0) and (1 X,f1) are homotopic,
accordingly (1 X,f0)∗Φ and (1 X,f1)∗Φ represent the same cohomology class
by [1, Corollary 4.1.2].
(ii) is shown by the deﬁnition of σ-calibration.
(iii) By the point-wise inequality (1 X,f)∗Φ≤σ(f)vol, we have E(f) =/integraltext
X(1X,f)∗Φ iﬀ (1 X,f)∗Φ =σ(f)vol. /square
3.Examples
One of the typical example of the energy of maps is p-energy deﬁned for
the smooth maps between Riemannian manifolds. Let ( X,g) and (Y,h) be
Riemannian manifolds and f:X→Ybe a smooth map. Then the pullback

volgthe volume form of g. Thep-energyEp(f) is deﬁned by

By the H¨ older’s inequality, we have
Ep(f)≤volg(X)1−p/qEq(f)p/q
for 1≤p≤q. Thus we have the following proposition.

andg,hare K¨ ahler metrics. Let m= dim CXandn= dim CY. Then we
have the decomposition
T∗X⊗C= Λ1,0T∗X⊕Λ0,1T∗X,
TY⊗C=T1,0Y⊕T0,1Y,
accordingly the derivative df∈Γ(T∗X⊗f∗TY) is decomposed into

|df|2= 2|(∂f)1,0|2+2|(∂f)1,0|2.

the second statement implies that fis a (σ2,2

3.2.Calibrated submanifolds. In this subsection, we see the relation be-
tween the calibrated submanifolds in the sense of [6] and the calibrated
maps. We assume ( Yn,h) is a Riemannian manifold.
Deﬁnition 3.3 ([6]).For an integer 0 <m<n ,ψ∈Ωm(Y) is acalibration
ifdψ= 0 and
ψ|V≤volh|V
for anyy∈Yandm-dimensional oriented subspace V⊂TyY. Here,h|V
is the induced metric on Vand vol h|Vis its volume form whose orienta-
tion is compatible with the one equipped with V. Moreover, an oriented
submanifold X⊂Yis acalibrated submanifold if
ψ|TxX= vol|h|TxX
for anyx∈X.
Now, ifXis an oriented manifold with a volume form vol ∈Ωm(X), then
for every linear map A:TxX→TyYcan be regarded as an n×m-matrix
by taking a basis e1,...,emofTxXand an orthonormal basis of TyYwith
volx(e1,...,em) = 1. Then/radicalbig
det(tA·A) does not depend on the choice of
these basis. Therefore, for f∈C∞(X,Y), we can deﬁne the energy density

Proposition 3.4. Let(X,vol)be an oriented manifold equipped with a vol-
ume form and ψ∈Ωm(Y)be closed. Assume that dimRX=m < nand

Yψ∈Ωm(X×Y)is aτm-calibration. Moreover, for any embedding

(ii)fis a(τm,π∗

(ii)dfxis orientation preserving for any x∈Xreg.
Proof.Ifx∈Xis a critical point of f, then we can see
f∗volY∧ϕ|x= ˜τm,n(f)volg|x= 0.
Fix a regular point xand an oriented orthonormal basis e1,...,em∈TxX
such thatem−n+1,...,em∈Ker(dfx). Then we have
f∗volY∧ϕ(e1,...,em) = vol Y(dfx(e1),...,df x(en))ϕ(en+1,...,em),
˜τm,n(f)|x=|volY(dfx(e1),...,df x(en))|.
Sinceϕisacalibration, wehave ϕ(±en+1,en+2,...,em)≤1, hence|ϕ(en+1,...,em)| ≤
1. Therefore,
f∗volY∧ϕ(e1,...,em)≤ |volY(dfx(e1),...,df x(em−n))|= ˜τm,n(f)|x,
which implies that Φ is a ˜ τm,n-calibration.
Next we consider the condition
f∗volY∧ϕ|x= ˜τm,n(f)volg|x,
wherexis a regular value of f. In this case we have the orthogonal decom-

e1,...,en∈H,
en+1,...,em∈Ker(dfx),

volg(e1,...,em)>0.
Then we have
f∗volY∧ϕ(e1,...,em) =aϕ(en+1,...,em),
˜τm,n(f)volg(e1,...,em) =|a|=a.
Therefore, we have
f∗volY∧ϕ|x= ˜τm,n(f)volg|x
iﬀϕ(en+1,...,em) = 1. Now we have taken x∈Xregarbitrarily, hence we
have
f∗volY∧ϕ= ˜τm,n(f)volg

Theorem 4.2. Let(Xm,g)and(Yn,h)be Riemannian manifolds and X
be compact and oriented. For any 1≤k≤m, there is a constant C >0
depending only on k,(X,g),(Y,h)and the basis of Hk(X,R),Hk
bdd(Y,R)
such that for any f∈C∞(X,Y)we have
Ek(f)≥C|P([f∗]k

In particular, if [f∗]k
bddis a nonzero map, then the inﬁmum of Ek|[f]is
positive.
Proof.Take bounded closed k-formsβ1,...,β d∈Ωk(Y) such that {[βl]}lis
a basis ofHk
bdd(Y,R).
By the Hodge Theory, Hk(X) is isomorphic to the space of harmonic
k-forms as vector spaces. Therefore, for any basis of Hk(X,R), there is a
corresponding basis α1,...,α N∈Ωk(X) of the space of harmonic k-forms.

Remark 4.3. Combining the above theorem with Proposition 3.1, we also

5.Energy of the identity maps
In this section we consider when the identity map on compact o riented
Riemannian manifold Xminimizes the energy. Here, we consider the family
of energies. For Riemannian manifolds ( Xm,g), (Yn,h) and points x∈X,
y∈Y, take a linear map A:TxX→TyY. Fixing orthonormal basis of TxX
andTyY, we can regard Aas ann×m-matirx. Denote by a1,...,am∈R≥0
the eigenvalues oftA·A, then put
|A|p:=/parenleftBiggm/summationdisplay
i=1ap/2

forp>0. Then |A|pis independent of the choice of the orthonormal basis
ofTxX. For a smooth map f:X→Y, let
σp,q(f)|x:=|dfx|q

Ep,q(f) :=/integraldisplay
Xσp,q(f)volg.
Note thatσ2,p=σpandE2,p=Ep.
From now on we consider ( Y,h) = (X,g) and a map f:X→X. Let 1 X
be the identity map of X.
Proposition 5.1. If1Xminimizes Ep,q|[1X], then it also minimizes Ep′,q′|[1X]
for anyp′≥pandq′≥q.
Proof.First of all, for any smooth map f, we have
|dfx|p≤m1/p−1/p′|dfx|p′,
Ep,q(f)≤mq/p−q/p′volg(X)1−q/q′/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay

by the H¨ older’s inequality, which gives Ep′,q′(f)≥CEp,q(f)q′/qfor some
constantC >0. Moreover, we have the equality for f= 1X. Therefore, we
can see
infEp′,q′|[1X]≥infCEq′/q
p,q|[1X]=CEp,q(1X)q′/q=Ep′,q′(1X)≥infEp′,q′|[1X].

Proposition 5.2 (cf.[7, Lemma 2.2]) .Let(X,g)be a compact oriented
Riemannian manifold of dimension m. Then1Xminimizes E1,min its ho-
motopy class.
Proof.The proof is essentially given by [7, Lemma 2.2]. For any map
f:X→X, we can see
f∗volg= det(df)volg≤m−mσ1,m(f)volg.
Here, the second inequality follows from the inequality

Moreover, the equality holds if f= 1X. /square
Next we consider the analogy of the above proposition. We ass ume that
Xhas a nontrivial parallel k-form.
Denote byg0thestandardmetricon Rm, whichalso inducesthemetricon

isometryI:Rm→TxXsuch thatI∗(ϕ|x) =ϕ0.
Denote by ∗g0: Λk(Rm)∗→Λm−k(Rm)∗the Hodge star operator induced
by the standard metric and let vol g0∈Λm(Rm)∗be the volume form. First
of all, we show the following proposition for the local model (g0,ϕ0).
Proposition 5.3. Let(g0,ϕ0)be as above. Assume that |ιuϕ0|g0is inde-

Proposition 5.4. Let(Xm,g)be a compact oriented Riemannian manifold

By putting A=dfxand identifying Rm∼=TxX, this is equivalent to the

Next we have to consider when the assumption for ( g0,ϕ0) is satisﬁed. If
G⊂SO(m) is a closed subgroup, then the linear action of SO(m) onRm
induces the action of GonRm. Similarly, since SO(m) acts on Λk(Rm)∗for
allk,Galso acts on them. Here, Rmisirreducible as a G-representation if
any subspace W⊂Rmwhich is closed under the G-action is equal to Rmor
{0}. Forϕ0∈Λk(Rm)∗, denote by Stab( ϕ0)⊂SO(m) the stabilizer of ϕ0.
Lemma 5.5. LetGbe a closed subgroup of SO(m)and assume that Rm
is irreducible as a G-representation. Moreover, assume that G⊂Stab(ϕ0).
Then|ιuϕ0|g0is independent of u∈Rmif|u|g0= 1.16 K. HATTORI
Proof.Deﬁne a linear map Ψ: Rm→Λk−1(Rm)∗by Ψ(u) :=ιuϕ0, then we
can see Ψ is G-equivariant map since the G-action preserves ϕ0. Since the
SO(m)-action on Λk−1(Rm)∗preserves the inner product, we can see
g0(AΨ(u),AΨ(v)) =g0(Ψ(u),Ψ(v))
for anyA∈Gandu,v∈Rm. Moreover, the left-hand-side is equal to
g0(Ψ(Au),Ψ(Av)) since Ψ is G-equivariant.
Now, lete1,...,embe the standard orthonormal basis of Rm, and deﬁne
the symmetric matrix H= (Hij)i,jbyHij:=g0(Ψ(ei),Ψ(ej)). Then by the
above argument we havetAHA=H. Letλ∈Rbe any eigenvalue of H
and denote by V(λ)⊂Rmthe eigenspace associate with λ. Then we can
see thatV(λ) is closed under the G-action, hence we have V(λ) =Rmby
the irreducibility, which implies

Let (Xm,g) be an oriented Riemannian manifold and denote by Hol g⊂
SO(m) the holonomy group. We consider ( X,g,ϕ,G,g 0,ϕ0), whereϕ∈
Ωk(X) is closed, ( g0,ϕ0) is a local model of ( g,ϕ) andGis a closed subgroup
ofSO(m) such that Hol g⊂G⊂Stab(ϕ0). The followings are examples.

We can apply Proposition 5.4 and Lemma 5.5 to the above cases a nd
obtain the following result.
Theorem 5.6. Let(X,g,ϕ)be an oriented compact Riemannian manifold
whose geometric structure is one of Table 1 and let Φbe as in Proposition
5.4. Then the identity map 1Xis a(σk,k,Φ)-calibrated map. In particular,
1Xminimizes Ek,kin its homotopy class.
6.Intersection of Smooth maps
In [2], Croke and Fathi introduced the homotopy invariant of a smooth
mapf:X→Ywhich gives the lower bound to the 2-energy E2. In this
section, we compare our invariant with the invariant in [2].
First of all, we review the intersection of smooth map introd uced in [2].
Let (X,g) and (Y,h) be Riemannian manifolds and suppose Xis compact.
Here, we do not assume Xis oriented, and we use the volume measure µg
ofginstead of the volume form.SMOOTH MAPS MINIMIZING THE ENERGY 17
Croke and Fathi deﬁned the following quantity
if(g,h) = lim
t→∞1

Sg(X)φt(v)dLioug(v)
for a smooth map f:X→Yand called it the intersection of f. Here, Liou g

to
s/mapsto→f(γv(s)),0≤s≤t,
whereγvis the geodesic from p∈Xwithγ′
v(0) =v∈Sg(X).
Theorem 6.1 ([2]).For a smooth map f:X→Y, the intersection if(g,h)
is homotopy invariant, that is, if(g,h) =if′(g,h)if[f′] = [f]. Moreover,
for anyf, we have/integraldisplay
Xσ2(f)dµg≥m
V(Sm−1)2µg(X)if(g,h)2,
whereV(Sm−1)is the volume of the unit sphere Sm−1inRm.
First of all, we introduce the variant of if(g,h) and improve the above
theorem. We put
jf(g,h) := lim

t2/integraldisplay
Sg(X)φt(v)2dLioug(v).
Theorem 6.2. For a smooth map f:X→Y,jf(g,h)is homotopy invari-
ant. Moreover, for any f, we have/integraldisplay

V(Sm−1)jf(g,h),
where the equality holds iﬀ the image of the geodesic in Xbyfminimizes

Proof.The proof is parallel to that of Theorem 6.1. The homotopy inv ari-
ance ofjf(g,h) is same as the case of if(g,h). See the proof of [2, Lemma
1.3].
Next we show the inequality. Here we can see/integraldisplay

Now, suppose

therefore, the inequality in Theorem 6.2 implies the inequa lity in Theorem

Next we compute jf(g,h) in the case of ﬂat tori, and compare with the
lower bound obtained by Proposition 3.6. Let ( Tm,g) and (Tn,h) be as in
