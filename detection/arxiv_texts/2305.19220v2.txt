We develop a model for quantum computation with Rydberg atom arrays, which only relies on
global driving, without the need of local addressing of the qubits: any circuit is executed by a
sequence of global, resonant laser pulses on a static atomic arrangement. We present two construc-
tions: for the first, the circuit is imprinted in the trap positions of the atoms and executed by the
pulses; for the second, the atom arrangement is circuit-independent, and the algorithm is entirely
encoded in the global driving sequence. Our results show in particular that a quadratic overhead
in atom number is sufficient to eliminate the need for local control to realize a universal quantum
processor. We give explicit protocols for all steps of an arbitrary quantum computation, and discuss
strategies for error suppression specific to our model. Our scheme is based on dual-species processors
with atoms subjected to Rydberg blockade constraints, but it might be transposed to other setups
as well.
Introduction.— Quantum computation (QC) leverages
quantum effects for solving computational problems. In
the standard paradigm [1], known as the circuit model
(CM), an algorithm is executed by applying a sequence
of gates on a register of quantum units (qubits); al-
ternatively, other models have been developed, includ-
ing measurement-based [2], adiabatic [3–5], and topolog-
ical [6] schemes. While they are all fundamentally equiv-
alent, particular features of each model are appealing for
specific implementations.
Recently, neutral atoms in optical tweezers have
emerged as a promising platform for quantum informa-
tion processing [7–9]: deterministically assembled arrays
are coherently manipulated with optical pulses and en-
tangled through Rydberg interactions [10–16], to realize
programmable and scalable processors [17–19]. One ap-
proach for QC is then to realize the CM: qubits are en-
coded in atomic levels, with gates executed via local op-
tical control. While this approach has seen remarkable
progress [19–22], individual addressing of atoms remains
a formidable technological challenge.
Here, we develop an alternative model for QC with
Rydberg atoms, which does not require local addressing
or dynamical rearrangement. Instead, the quantum al-
gorithm is executed by driving a static atomic array with
aglobal , resonant laser in the Rydberg blockade regime.
Specifically, a universal quantum processor featuring n
logical qubits is realized with an arrangement of O(n2)
atoms; any circuit of depth pis then executed by a se-
quence of O(np) pulses driving the transition between
an internal electronic ground and a Rydberg state. All
atoms are initialized in the internal ground state, and the
final read-out is in this computational basis, requiring no

local control. We present our model by first translating
any quantum algorithm to a sequence of global pulses on
a circuit-dependent arrangement of O(n2p) atoms (see
Fig. 1e); then, we reduce this to a universal arrangement
ofO(n2) atoms. We demonstrate this novel QC model on
the example of a dual-species array with species-selective
global drivings [23–29], but it can be transposed to other
architectures with static hardware layout.
Main picture.— Our QC model is based on several
key ideas, which we outline in the following, before detail-
ing them individually. We consider n1D wires of atoms,
each hosting a qubit degree of freedom. At each step, thearXiv:2305.19220v2  [quant-ph]  26 Oct 20232
qubit state is located at a single atom k, particularly, at
the interface between an ordered and a disordered sector
of the wire (Fig. 2, top); we denote this as |Ψ(k)⟩. We
design a sequence of global laser pulses, such that
|Ψ(k)⟩pulses− − − − → | Ψ(k+ 1)⟩; (1)
essentially, the qubit propagates through the wire as the
pulses progress - defining an information flow.
By breaking the symmetry at selected points, we ma-
nipulate the quantum information during this propaga-
tion; specifically, we introduce two types of impurities.
We insert impurities of the first type inside the wires:
when an interface reaches them, we apply sequences of
global pulses, which effectively manipulate individually
the impurities at the interfaces (single-qubit gates). We
insert impurities of the second type between the wires,
triggering interactions between the interfaces when they
pass by (multiple-qubit gates). The combination of these
constructions translates any algorithm into an arrange-
ment of atoms, where wires represent the lines in the
circuit, and impurities the location of gates (Fig. 1e). In
the remainder we elaborate on these ideas, as well as on
the remaining aspects required for universal QC, such as
initialization.
Physical setup.— We consider a tweezer array with two
atomic species, AandB, where atoms can be arranged in
arbitrary 2D configurations [9, 28–33]. For each atom, we
consider two electronic states (Fig. 1a): a ground state
|g⟩, and a highly excited Rydberg state |r⟩; we define the
Pauli algebra as Z = |g⟩⟨g| − |r⟩⟨r|, X = |r⟩⟨g|+|g⟩⟨r|.
The two levels can be coherently coupled in a species-
selective way with global resonant fields, i.e. lasers acting
identically on all atoms of the same species. Moreover,
atoms in |r⟩interact pairwise via induced dipole-dipole
interactions. The Hamiltonian is H=HA+HB+Hint,
with

Here, Ω XandϕXare the Rabi frequency and phase
of the laser driving X ∈ {A ,B}, and Vi,jis the inter-
action strength between atoms iandj. This includes
both intra- and inter-species interactions [34]. The in-
teraction strength decays with the atomic separation,
di,j, as Vi,j∼d−6
i,j. At short distances this gives the
Rydberg blockade effect [35–37], preventing more than
one excitation within a blockade radius RB, while at
larger separations interactions are negligible. We as-
sume for every pair of atoms either perfect blockade or
no interactions [38], resulting in a dual-species PXP-
model [39, 40]. The parameters Ω XandϕXare con-
trolled time-dependently, but the atomic arrangements,
and thus the mutual blockade relations, are static.
Logical qubits.— We start by describing our basic
building block: a single atomic wire hosting a logical

pulses. The first line identifies the standard configuration
|Ψ(k)⟩, with |ψ⟩at the interface between a Z2−ordered and
a disordered sector. The U Xapply blockade-conditioned flips
of the atomic state.
qubit. The two species alternate, and are subjected
to nearest-neighbor blockade; we label the atoms by
k∈ {0,1,2, ...}.
A wire is in the standard configuration (SC), with
theinterface at site k, if all atoms at k′< k are
in the Z2−ordered configuration, |. . . r k−4gk−3rk−2gk−1⟩,
while for k′> k they are all in the ground state,
|gk+ 1gk+ 2gk+ 3. . .⟩; the interface atom at kcan be in any
superposition |ψk⟩=α|gk⟩+β|rk⟩. We use the notation
|Ψ(k)⟩=|...rk−4gk−3rk−2gk−1⟩|ψk⟩|gk+ 1gk+ 2gk+ 3...⟩,(3)
depicted in Fig. 2, top.
Throughout the computation, we apply a sequence of
pulses of the form
...UBUAUBUAUBUA..., (4)
alternating the addressed species. Here U Xinduce a con-
ditional state-flip of the X−atoms, flipping the popula-
tions, |g⟩ ↔ | r⟩, if all neighbors are in |g⟩. While this
might be implemented by πpulses, we employ a general-
ized pulse design (Fig. 3a), for reasons that will become
clear below.
Without loss of generality assume the atom hosting
the interface at site kis of the A−type; we now show
that [41]
UBUAUB|Ψ(k)⟩=|Ψ(k+ 1)⟩. (5)
This can be understood by considering the blockade con-
straints step-by-step (Fig. 2). First we apply U B: because
the system is in the SC (3), all B−atoms to the left of k
are blockaded, while those to the right get excited; only
the atom at site k+ 1 evolves non-trivially, conditioned
on the state of the qubit at k. It gets excited iff the latter
is in|gk⟩, leading to
|...gk−3rk−2gk−1⟩/bracketleftig
α|gr⟩+β|rg⟩/bracketrightig
k,k+ 1|gk+ 2rk+ 3gk+ 4...⟩,(6)3
with|ψ⟩shared between kandk+1 (Fig. 2, second line).
Then, U Ade-excites the A−atoms at k′≤k, while all
others are blockaded, yielding
UAUB|Ψ(k)⟩=|...gk−2gk−1gk⟩/bracketleftig
X|ψ⟩/bracketrightig
k+ 1|gk+ 2rk+ 3gk+ 4...⟩,
(7)
moving the (flipped) qubit to k+ 1 (Fig. 2, third line).
Finally, U Bexcites the B−atoms at k′≤kand de-excites
those at k′≥k+2, while flipping k+1, leading to Eq. (5)
(Fig. 2, bottom line).
Altogether, the cycle (4) moves the SC (3) as in Eq. (5):
it induces a dispersionless flow of quantum information,
with the interface moving to the right. This is the un-
derlying mechanism of our model: while the pulse cycle
propagates the information, we manipulate it by insert-
ing additional global pulses at stroboscopic times; impu-
rities will enable non-trivial operations. The rest of the
paper is devoted to explaining how we can unlock the
full toolbox of universal QC. From now on we consider
nwires (Fig. 1e), each hosting its qubit; the pulse cycle
thus moves all qubits in parallel through their wires.
Collective phase gates.— One key operation imprints
a phase on all the qubits in parallel, specifically, Ztot=/circlemultiplytext
QZQ, where Qruns over logical qubits (wires). Con-
sider the SC with the interface on an A−atom at k
(Fig. 3b). To realize Ztot, we drive Bwith a global 2 π
pulse: atoms to the left of kare blockaded, and those at
k′> k+ 1 acquire an irrelevant global phase. However,
theB−atom at site k+1 picks up a phase −1 iff the qubit
atkis in|gk⟩. This conditional phase is thus equivalent
to the application of a Z gate at k; this happens in par-
allel for all the wires, yielding Ztot.
Impurities.— Asuperatom is a cluster of Satoms, all
arranged within a radius RB. The blockade constrains
them to a collective dynamics, where only one can be ex-
cited at a time; this effectively realizes a two-level system,
featuring a ground state |¯g⟩, with all cluster-atoms in |g⟩,
and an effective excited state |¯r⟩, with a single excitation
shared among the cluster. Under the Hamiltonian (2)
the Rabi frequency of this two-level system is enhanced
as√
SΩX. While the arguments below transpose to any
S≥2, we consider S= 4, with the prescription
|¯g⟩≡|gggg⟩,|¯r⟩≡|rggg⟩+|grgg⟩+|ggrg⟩+|gggr⟩
2,(8)
and the corresponding Pauli algebra. We assume each
superatom is always either completely inside or outside
the blockade radii of other atoms, and thus behaves as a
unique entity.
Since the superatoms have different Rabi frequency,
the pulses realizing U Xmust be carefully designed, not
to interfere with the previous protocols (Fig. 3a). Be-
low we replace some A−atoms inside the wires with
A−superatoms. Thus, U Ais designed to realize a flip
of the atomic state for both. Differently, B−superatoms
will be introduced between the wires, and we require U B
to act as a 4 πrotation on on them; also the 2 πpulse for
Ztottranslates to a 4 π.Single-qubit unitaries.— If we place ans A−superatom
instead of an A−atom at site kalong a wire, we can
execute a gate on the corresponding qubit when the in-
terface is located at k. For universal QC we need uni-
taries of the form U( ϕ, α) =e−iαR(ϕ)/2, where R( ϕ) =
cos(ϕ)X + sin( ϕ)Y (rotations around axes in the xy
plane); rotations around ˆ zare accounted for by classical
processing [42]. Thus, we will ignore phase corrections,
and denote byz= equalities holding up to phases.
When the interface is located at the superatom, we
apply a global pulse sequence, designed for the desired
unitary, such that: (i) normal atoms (of both species),
andB−superatoms, wherever they are located, are unaf-
fected; (ii) an A−superatom placed at kundergoes the
target unitary; (iii) A−superatoms placed at k′̸=kare
unaffected. We first show how to engineer a Hadamard,
H = (X+Z) /√
2z=e−iπY/4, and then generalize to arbi-
trary gates.
The pulse sequence for the Hadamard is shown in
Fig. 3c. It consists of three steps: first, a pulse sequence
onA, inducing a single-atom evolution U; then, the Ztot
protocol; finally, the inverse of the first, U†. The first
step acts on A−atoms as [43]
U = U/parenleftbiggπ
4,3π
2/parenrightbigg
U/parenleftbigg
−π
4,3π
4/parenrightbigg
U/parenleftigπ
2,π
2/parenrightig
U/parenleftig
0,π
4/parenrightigz=1; (9)
since it does not affect the atomic populations, during the
second step all blockade constraints are maintained, so
thatZtotworks as described above. Hence, for A−atoms
the sequence acts as U†ZU = Zz=1(for atoms at the
interface), or U†U =1(otherwise), thus addressing (i).
Consider now the superatom at k. Due to the enhanced
Rabi frequency, the first (third) step induces a different
unitary ¯U (¯U†). Specifically, the evolution is found by
considering effective doubled pulse durations in place of
Eq. (9), obtaining [44]
¯U = U/parenleftigπ
4,3π/parenrightig
U/parenleftbigg
−π
4,3π
2/parenrightbigg
U/parenleftigπ
2, π/parenrightig
U/parenleftig
0,π
2/parenrightig
; (10)
this corresponds to a π/4 rotation. Then, because kis
the interface of the SC, the second step acts as a ¯Z gate
on it (as part of Ztot); finally the inverse of the first step
is applied. Eventually, one finds
¯Utot=¯U†¯Z¯U =−¯X +¯Z√
2z=−e−iπ¯Y/4, (11)
i.e., the overall operation is a Hadamard. Thus (ii) is
fulfilled. Regarding (iii), any A−superatom located at
k′̸=kdoes not feel Ztotbecause it is not at the inter-
face of the SC: if k′≤k−2 its neighboring B−atoms
are both blockaded; if k′≥k+ 2 none is, hence the two
conditional phases annihilate as ¯Z2=1. Therefore, the
first and third step cancel out, leading to an identity.
The above arguments generalize to π/2 rotations
around any axis in the xyplane: any U( ϕ,π
2) is achieved
by shifting all the phases by ϕ−π/2 in Eqs. (9) and (10).4
FIG. 3. (a) The pulses U Xact as (blockade-conditioned) flips of the atomic state. The first line shows the duration of the
pulses (units of 1 /ΩX), while the second the phase of the laser. (b-d) By globally driving the whole array, exploiting impurities
we achieve single- and two-qubit gates (CZ∗=ZtotCZ). (e) Universal arrangement: moving the information both to the left
and to the right, at each step we localize it at positions where we achieve the desired individual control.
Moreover, through π/2 rotations around xyplane axes,
we engineer any U( ϕ, α). For instance, arbitrary rota-
tions around the xaxis are composed as
U(0, α)z= U/parenleftigπ
2−α,π
2/parenrightig
U/parenleftig

; (12)
again, generalization to arbitrary xyaxes follows directly.
Two remarks are important. First, the feature of the
SC allowing local control, is that only the interface in-
teracts with an odd number of non blockaded atoms, in
turn enabling Ztot. Second, this only works if we never
haveA−superatoms close to each other, implying that
their distance must always be ∆ k≥4; otherwise, the
intermediate step corrupts the SC.
Entangling gates.— Placing a B−superatom between
two wires enables the application of a CZ = 1−2|gg⟩⟨gg|
gate, entangling the corresponding qubits. The pulse se-
quence in Fig. 3d is applied when the interfaces are ad-
jacent to the B−superatom; this induces an effective 2 π
rotation of the superatom, conditional on both interfaces
being in |g⟩, resulting in a CZ gate. The sequence is de-
signed to also induce a 2 πrotation on the Batoms: the
only byproduct is a global Ztot. The overall operation in-
duced by the pulse in Fig. 3d is thus CZ∗=ZtotCZ. This
can be generalized to arbitrary conditional-phase gates,
and even multi-qubit gates.
Initialization.— All atoms start in |g⟩. As in Fig. 1e,
the wires begin with a superatom (in k= 0); since only
these superatoms interact with just one B−atom, we can
apply the protocol for single-qubit gates to bring them
all to |¯r⟩. Then, starting the cycle (4) with U Bresults
in the SC at k= 2, with all qubits in |ψ⟩=|r⟩after
6 alternating pulses. Subsequently, the transport works
as explained, thus the computation starts. Note that we
unlock local control at k= 4.
Universal arrangement.— So far, we mapped any
algorithm into O(np) global pulses driving O(n2p)
atoms [45], whose circuit-dependent arrangement mim-ics the gates [46]. Differently, we now discuss a univer-
sal processor , consisting of a circuit-independent arrange-
ment of O(n2) atoms; any circuit can then be executed
through O(np) global pulses. We exploit the fact that by
inverting the order in (4), the interface moves to the left.
Then, with arrangements as in Fig. 3e, we execute any
circuit step-by-step, by moving the information to the
left or right to localize it at positions where gates can be
triggered. The construction of the universal arrangement
works by placing an A−superatom in each wire, and a
B−superatom between each pair of neighboring wires;
these are arranged such that we can execute any gate in-
dividually, by moving the interface to the dedicated posi-
tion (the interface can also be moved across superatoms
without executing any gate). The number of atoms here
no longer depends on p, and the arrangement is circuit-
independent, realizing a universal processor [47].
Suppressing errors.— While our model incurs a O(n2)
overhead, this does not necessarily translate to higher er-
ror rates, as quantum information is only stored at the
interface, allowing classical correction schemes on the rest
of the array. For instance, at stroboscopic times all atoms
of one species are in |g⟩, with the interface on the other
species; hence inserting species-selective resets allows to
periodically eliminate errors on idle atoms. Thus only
errors at the interface remain, resulting in a O(n) error
scaling, similar to the CM.
In addition, several techniques can be employed to re-
duce errors: all steps presented here are designed for
didactical simplicity, but could be optimized using op-
timal control [48]. Moreover, specific F¨ orster regimes
can be chosen to suppress unwanted interactions from
Van-der-Waals tails [38]. Finally, one might incorpo-
rate quantum error correction without local control us-
ing measurement-free paradigms [49, 50], e.g. through
3D atom arrangements [51]. A detailed analysis of these
concepts is left for future work.5
Conclusion.— We showed that the collective many-
body dynamics of a static arrangement of globally driven
Rydberg atoms is complex enough to enable universal
quantum computation. These ideas can be implemented
on dual-species Rydberg arrays, but also be transposed to
other setups, including single-species arrays (e.g. leverag-
ing hyperfine levels or, potentially, quantum many-body
scars [39]), but also other physical platforms. Our model
could also be used for hybrid designs, with local con-
trol combined with globally controlled modules. Our re-
sults open up new avenues for quantum processor de-sign, but also highlight a new connection between out-
of-equilibrium many-body dynamics and quantum infor-
mation.

Universal Quantum Computation in Globally Driven Rydberg Atom Arrays
The proposed model for universal quantum computation features a static atomic arrangement, where the dynamics
is constrained by the built-in mutual Rydberg blockade interactions. In the main text, we work in the assumption
of an ideal blockade regime, corresponding to a dual-species PXP model; this approximation holds when the mutual
interaction Vi,j∼d−6
i,jbetween any pair of atoms iandjis always either negligible, or very strong (compared to
the Rabi frequency). Here, we justify this approximation by evaluating the strength of the interactions in our setup.
Specifically, we consider the construction of B−superatoms for S= 4, as depicted in Fig. 1 of the main paper; this
is potentially the most problematic part of the proposed arrangement. The construction we consider is shown more
in detail in Fig. 1. Therein, atoms composing the superatom are placed at the vertexes of a square of edge length ϵ,
and the arrangement is constructed such that all the wanted interactions occur at most at a distance d; specifically,
we set
d1,2=d2,3=d3,4=...=d5,6=d6,7=...=d11,12=d2,16=...=d8,15=d≥d2,13=...=d8,15, (1)
while unwanted interactions occur at distances ≥d. We thus also restrict to ϵ≤d/√
2. Note that given ϵall the
distances are determined by the angle θ.
For quantifying the strength of the blockade, we define
Vblockade=C
d6=V1,2=... (2)
as the weakest among the wanted interactions (i.e., between the pairs listed in Eq. (1)); note that e.g. V13,14≥V3,14≥
Vblockadein our construction). Moreover, we quantify the violation of the ideal regime through the strongest among
all the unwanted interactions,
Vunwanted= max {V1,3, V2,8, V3,14, V8,10, V1,4, V10,15, V8,11}, (3)
where we listed the interactions up to symmetries. In Fig. 1, we indicate these unwanted interactions by connecting
the atoms with red and blue lines for intra-species and inter-species interactions respectively. Note that Vunwanted
depends on both ϵandθ. As a figure of merit for the validity of the PXP approximation, we consider the ratio
Vunwanted/Vblockade; specifically, for given ϵandθthe ideal blockade regime is valid when the condition
Vunwanted(ϵ, θ)/Vblockade≪1 (4)
holds. Intuitively, small values of ϵare advantageous (with ideal superatoms for ϵ−→0), but this parameter is limited
by experimental capabilities (and ultimately by fundamental limits); differently, the angle θcan be chosen arbitrarily.
Thus, in what follows for fixed ϵwe optimize over θ, hence finding the ideal arrangement for given experimental
capabilities.
First, in the central plot of Fig. 1 we consider inter- and intra-species interactions at the same level. For realistic
values of ϵsuch as ϵ= 0.1, we find Vunwanted/Vblockade= 4.9×10−2, which shows that the ideal blockade appoximation
is well justified. It is useful to compare these unwanted interactions arising due to the presence of the superatom,
with those that are already present in the 1D wire, the strongest of which being V3,4∼2−6; in our construction, we
have Vunwanted/V3,4= 2.4. But even for relatively large values such as ϵ= 0.4 one gets Vunwanted/Vblockade= 0.14,
which would arguably still justify a PXP approximation.
Importantly, F¨ orster resonances allow even more convenient interacting regimes; specifically, in a dual-species
platform we consider it should be possible to use F¨ orster resonances such that the inter-species interactions are
strongly dominant over intra-species interactions. In such a regime, for instance the dominating unwanted interaction
inside a 1D wire would not be the next-nearest interaction V3,4, but the third-nearest interaction V4,5; in our model,
this is extremely convenient because all interactions are actually inter-species, except for those inside the superatoms,
which are however not limited by geometric issues of the arrangement, but rather by the non ideal ϵ−→0 limit. In
the right-side plot of Fig. 1, we plot the strength of unwanted interactions for this regime, where we can effectively
neglect the intra-species contributions. Here, even for ϵas large as ϵ= 0.4 one gets Vunwanted/Vblockade= 1.6×10−2,
thus largely justifying an ideal blockade approximation; for ϵ= 0.1 one even reaches Vunwanted/Vblockade= 6.6×10−3.
In conclusion, we see that a PXP regime can be fulfilled to an excellent degree with the construction presented in
the main text. We also remark that the choice of the F¨ orster resonances employed plays a relevant role: even thougharXiv:2305.19220v2  [quant-ph]  26 Oct 20232
FIG. 1. To the left, the construction of the B−superatom, which mediates entangling gates between the logical qubits (wires).
The wanted, blockade interactions are represented by connecting the atoms with gray lines, while unwanted interactions are
depicted in red (intra-species) and blue (inter-species). In the center, the unwanted interactions for different values of ϵ,
optimized over all angles θ; here the colors refer to the left figure. To the right, the interacting regime where inter-species
interactions are dominating, and intra-species interactions can be neglected.
both the regimes considered allow for an ideal blockade approximation of the many-body dynamics, the second one
meets the criteria of the PXP approximation to much a higher degree. Finally, we note that, while in the main
text we focus on the case of S= 4 superatoms, any S≥2 is suitable for our model; in particular, the case S= 2
offers very compact and advantageous constructions, which ultimately also lead to a cleaner realization of the PXP
approximation.
