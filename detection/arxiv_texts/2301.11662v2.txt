Abstract
In this article, we conduct comparative studies on the optical properties of metallic
carbon nanotubes. Firstly, we compare the complex dielectric constant predicted by
an analytical model, the Linear Surface Conductivity Model, with ab initio calcula-
tions based on Density Functional Theory. We highlight the similarities and differences
between these two models, with the major discrepancy being a significantly different
behavior of the plasma frequency with respect to the carbon nanotube diameter. In the
second step, we compare the predictions of these models with experimental measure-
ments of the dielectric function. We demonstrate that the screened plasma frequency
serves as a reliable quantifier for distinguishing between the two models. In conclusion,
1arXiv:2301.11662v2  [physics.optics]  21 Sep 2023we find that the ab initio calculations more accurately describe the optical properties
of metallic carbon nanotubes compared to the commonly used Linear Surface Conduc-
tivity Model.
Introduction
Carbon nanotubes are appealing nanostructures made exclusively of carbon atoms that dis-
play a large variety of electronic and optical responses. Depending on their structure, carbon
nanotubes could display metallic or semiconducting electronic properties. Semiconducting
carbon nanotubes have been extensively studied because of their potential as light sources
in the near-infrared spectral range.1,2On the other hand, metallic Single-Wall Carbon Nan-
oTubes (m-SWCNT) could be envisioned as the smallest metallic wire at the nanoscale with
exceptional electrical properties. Indeed, in contrast to nanowires based on noble metals,3
individual m-SWCNTs are defect-free and present the highest-known DC-conductance.4The
potential of applications of carbon nanotubes is not restricted to optic or electronic areas1
but also includes biological and medical studies5where their small size allows for drug de-
livery inside cells. Quantitative predictions of many physical phenomena implying carbon
nanotubes requires the knowledge of their optical properties. Some typical examples are
the potential use of a single m-SWCNT as a plasmonic antenna6or playing the role of an
optical cavity to modify the spontaneous emission rate of an emitter due to Purcell effect.7,8
Some applications need the knowledge of SWCNT optical properties on a wide frequency
range, the radiative heat transfer between two carbon nanotubes9,10being an example. A
second one are Van der Waals forces that dominates interactions at the molecular scale.
Being of electromagnetic nature, their magnitude as well as their possibility to be repulsive
or attractive crucially depend on the optical properties of the molecules and their environ-
ment.11A quantitative calculation of Van der Waals forces acting on carbon nanotubes12
may be valuable giving new insights for any application in biology. Both the real part and
the imaginary part of the dielectric function are required to make meaningful predictions of
2the above applications.
In this article, we focus on the optical properties of m-SWCNT because they have been
little explored compared to those of semiconductor carbon nanotubes.1Specifically, we want
to unravel the contribution of the intraband transitions that lead to the metallic behaviour of
m-SWCNT which is of primary interest in several applications such as plasmonic antennas,6
radiative heat transfer9,12or biology.10
Theory and Experiment
The optical properties of materials can be determined through experimental measurements
or by modelling their response to electromagnetic field excitations. However, it is crucial
to validate models by comparing them with the experimental data in order to assess their
accuracy and the range of their validity. Regarding m-SWCNT, the literature reports both
theoretical studies and experimental works. Theoretical investigations encompass a range of
approaches, including first principles numerical calculations13,14as well as analytical meth-
ods.15,16Most of the ab initio studies focused on the optical properties of semiconducting
SWCNT to predict their band-gap.17–19While there is some works concerning m-SWCNTs,
a crucial aspect, namely the contribution of intraband transitions that accounts for the
metallic behavior of m-SWCNTs, is often missing.20T. Movlarooy21computed the dielectric
functions for two metallic chiralities, (8,8) and (15,0); however, the trend of variations in op-
tical properties as a function of diameter was not provided, making it difficult to extrapolate
their behavior for other chiralities. The linear surface conductivity model is a widely used
analytical model15for describing the optical properties of carbon nanotubes. This model is
applicable to both semiconducting and metallic chiralities, but it relies on approximations
and has not been validated through comparison with measurements over a wide frequency
range. It is important to emphasize that in order to conduct a meaningful comparison be-
tween model’s predictions and experimental measurements, the following requirements need
3to be met:
•The sample must be sorted by separating the metallic and the semiconducting chi-
ralities.22This assures that the measurement of the dielectric function of metallic
chiralities is not spoiled by the contribution of the semiconducting chiralities and vice
versa.
•The real part and imaginary part of the dielectric constant have to be measured as they
both contribute to the electrodynamics properties of m-SWCNT heterostructures.6,8,10
Measuring a single quantity, such as the scattering cross section,23is not enough to be
conclusive as errors in the real part and imaginary part may compensate to reproduce
the measurement.
•In the infrared range and at smaller frequencies, the dielectric constant of m-SWCNT
follows a Drude’s model. Its variations typically scale as 1 /ω, where ωis the light
frequency. A measurement that aims to be quantitative have to be performed over
several frequency decades.
A review of the literature shows that none of the available measurements fulfills these
requirements. Indeed some measurements of the dielectric function are limited to unsorted
samples mixing semiconducting and metallic SWCNTs.24–30Ref.31reports the real-part of
the optical conductivity for m-SWCNT over a wide frequency range but missed the imaginary
part. The most complete report to date32has measured the complex electrical-conductivity
for metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs, but only for a narrow frequency range (0-40 THz,
0-0.16 eV).
The goal of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we wish to quantitatively compare the predic-
tions from the linear surface conductivity model and from ab initio calculations since this last
theoretical method can relax some assumptions performed to tackle the analytical model.
We report new theoretical values for the plasma frequency of m-SWCNT. First-principles
based calculations predict a linear dependency of the plasma frequency with the m-SWCNT
4diameter while the linear surface conductivity model predicts variations as the inverse of the
m-SWCNT diameter. Secondly, we wish to fill the lack of comparison between theoretical
predictions and measurements. We have measured both the real part and the imaginary
part of the dielectric function over the energy range [0.05,4] eV for a m-SWCNT sample.
We consider the screened plasma frequency E⋆as a quantifier to unambiguously prove that
the first principles calculations predict more accurately the optical properties of m-SWCNT
than the linear surface conductivity model.
Carbon nanotubes are anisotropic materials, and their dielectric function ¯ ε(ω) at the
angular frequency ωis a second rank tensor with two different contributions:
¯ε(ω) =
ε⊥(ω) 0 0
0 ε⊥(ω) 0
0 0 ε∥(ω)

where ε∥is the axial dielectric function, along the nanotube axis and ε⊥is the transverse
dielectric function in the plane perpendicular to the SWCNT axis. Both intraband and
interband transitions33contribute to the dielectric constant. Generally, we can write each
component of the dielectric tensor as being the sum of the contribution of intraband and
interband transitions: ε∥(ω) =ε∥
intra(ω) +ε∥
inter(ω) and ε⊥(ω) =ε⊥
intra(ω) +ε⊥
inter(ω). These
last four quantities can be independently computed either by the linear surface conductivity
model or by ab initio methods.
The linear surface conductivity model is analytical. It assumes that carbon nanotubes
are strictly one-dimensional objects being infinitely thin (Assumption A1) and infinitely
longs. The immediate consequence of the assumption (A1) is that carbon nanotubes are
non-polarizable object in the directions transverse to the cylinder axis. Consequently, the
transverse dielectric constant is fixed to one, i.e.ε⊥(ω) = 1, in this model.
The linear surface conductivity model assumes that the electronic response to an elec-
5tromagnetic wave excitation is dominated by the π-electrons, neglecting the contribution of
σ-electron. The dispersion relations of the π-electrons are computed in the tight-binding
approximation34assuming the parameters to be those of graphene. This approximation
neglects the curvature effects inherent to the geometry of carbon nanotubes. These assump-
tions are referred as the set of approximations (A2). These assumptions are performed to
process the analytical model and it is difficult to associate them individually with the con-
tribution of the intraband or the interband transitions to optical properties of CNT. The
assumption A1 implies that the carbon nanotubes are infinitely thin and infinitely long ob-
ject, as a 1D wire. This has a direct consequence on the perpendicular dielectric function for
both the intraband and the interband transitions. It implies that the transverse dielectric
function is strictly equal to one. On the other hand, the assumption A2 involves calculat-
ing the electronic dispersion relation in the tight-binding approximation with the graphene
parameters. Consequently, only the π-electrons contribute to the optical properties while
the contribution of the σ-electrons is neglected. This assumption also neglects the curvature
effects that are known to be non negligible at low energy due to a curvature-induced gap for
semi-metallic chiralities. This assumption has consequences on both the intraband and the
interband transitions.
The amplitude of the external electromagnetic field is assumed to be small leading to
linear perturbation of the electronic distribution function around the electronic distribution
function at equilibrium. So, under this approximation, both the contribution from the
intraband and the interband transitions can be analytically computed from the Boltzmann
equation. They are given by the following equations:
σ1(ω) =−ie2

respectively for the intraband and the interband transitions.35The quantity εc(pz, k)
represents the dispersion law of π-electrons in the SWNT where adefines the first Brillouin
zone. The integration is performed over the variable pz, which denotes the projection of
the electron quasimomentum onto the SWNT axis. The quantities Pcvandωcvrefer to the
normalized matrix element of the electron dipole momentum operator and the frequency of
the electron interband transitions, respectively. ρeqcorresponds to the population difference
between the conduction band and the valence band at thermal equilibrium. RCNT denotes
the carbon nanotube radius, while τ1andτ2are the relaxation time for the intraband and
interband transition, respectively. Finally, eis the electron charge and ℏis the reduced
Planck constant.
The linear surface conductivity σ∥has the dimension of a conductance. Consequently, a
characteristic length-scale t⋆has to be introduced to relate the surface conductivity σ∥and
the dielectric function ε∥. It is an ad-hoc parameter. We follow ref.36and choose the carbon
nanotube diameter t⋆= 2RCNT as this ad-hoc parameter. Consequently, the dielectric
function depends on the linear surface conductivity σ∥(ω) through the equation:
ε∥(ω) = 1 + iσ∥(ω)
ε0t⋆ω(3)
where ε0is the vacuum permittivity.
The linear surface conductivity model can deal with semiconductors and metallic carbon
nanotubes but the computation of the interband transitions is practically limited to achiral
SWCNT. Indeed, only for achiral nanotubes, the energy-dispersion relations for the valence
and the conduction bands are explicitly known.34At low energy, the contribution of the
intraband transition dominates the contribution of the interband transitions. This contri-
7bution is given by a Drude’s model,37a generic model describing the optical properties of
metals. Drude’s model depends on two parameters, the plasma frequency ωpand the relax-
ation time τ. The linear surface conductivity model allows the computation of the plasma
frequency through the equation:

m2+n2+mnis the radius of a SWCNT with chiral
indices (m,n). Eq.(4) is valid for achiral m-SWCNTs35but also for chiral m-SWCNTs.15
The relaxation effects are incorporated phenomenologically.39Although a different relax-
ation time can be introduced for the intraband τ1and the interband transitions τ2, they are
usually assumed to be equals,10,35,36,38,40τ1=τ2. To simplify notations, they will be denoted
byτin the following. We will assume τ= 35 fs in agreement with ref.35,38Note that this
value is consistent with our experimental measurements as explained in the following.
In this paper, we have computed the optical properties of m-SWCNTs taking advantage of
the Density Functional Theory (DFT). Kohn-Sham equations are numerically solved using a
self consistent procedure. This method relaxes the assumptions (A1) and (A2) inherent to the
analytical model: SWCNTs are no more assumed to be 1D-object. The electronic potential
takes into account both the σ-electrons and the π-electrons. It is not limited to the first three
adjacent atoms in the hexagonal structure. Furthermore, DFT takes into account curvature
effects by computing a selected chirality (n,m). DFT calculations predicts both the intraband
and interband contributions to the dielectric function. Since we focus the study on m-
SWCNT, we are not interested on excitons contribution. We show in Supplementary material
S4 that the excitons contribute only marginally to the dielectric function as compared to the
contribution of the interband transitions. The optical spectra of the different nanotubes are
obtained using the first-order time-dependent perturbation theory within the random phase
8approximation (RPA).
For the interband contributions, the diagonal terms of the imaginary part of the dielectric
function, Im[εσ
inter] with σ=∥or⊥, can be calculated from the eigenvalues and wavefunctions
of a band calculation:

Similarly to the linear surface conductivity model, DFT calculations do not predict re-
laxation effects at the RPA level. Consequently, the DFT calculations may overestimate the
contribution of the interband transitions. Concerning the intraband transitions, they are
incorporated phenomenologically through relaxation time τ. The numerical value of τ= 35
fs is used as for the linear surface conductivity model.
More details on the computation of the dielectric function with the DFT method are
given in supplementary material.
Results from the two theories are compared in Fig.(1). First we discuss the axial com-
ponent of the dielectric tensor ε∥(ω) for both the interband and the intraband transitions.

10tric function for a m-SWCNT with diameter d= 1.22 nm [chiral indices (9,9)]. The curves
are similar with a slight difference at low energy but with a 0.4 eV shift at the first peak.
Higher order peaks present a larger discrepancy. Fig.(1-b) shows the real part of the contri-
bution of the interband transitions to the dielectric function for a m-SWCNT with diameter
d= 0.70 nm [chiral indices (9,0)]. This chirality is of semi-metallic nature, characterized by
a band-gap at low energy, measured in ref.41near E∼0.08 eV in agreement with our DFT
calculations. This band-gap manifests itself as a large contribution in the real and imaginary
part of the dielectric constant at low energy and is responsible for the low-energy blow-up
observed in Fig.(1b). The linear surface conductivity model does not predict this contribu-
tion since the low-energy band-gap results from the m-SWCNT curvature. This discrepancy
between the two theories is not negligible.
The intraband transitions contribute to the dielectric function as a Drude model in the
two theories. As a consequence, we compare the predictions for the plasma frequency ωp.
They are shown in Fig.(1-c) as a function of the m-SWCNT diameters. The calculations has
been done for metallic nanotubes with chiral indices ( m, m ) and for semi-metallic nanotubes
with chiral indices ( m,0) or ( m, n) such as 2 m+n= 3qwith q∈N. The predictions from
DFT scale linearly with carbon nanotubes diameter while the predictions from the linear
surface conductivity model scale as ∝1/din assuming t⋆= 2RCNTin Eq.(4). While the two
curves seem to converge to similar values as the diameter goes to 1.6 nm, the deviation in
the predictions is significant for diameters smaller than 1.2 nm. Again, the two theoretical
methods predict rather different values for the intraband contributions.
For the transverse component ε⊥of the dielectric tensor, the two theories predict that
there is no contribution of the intraband transition, the plasma frequency being null. The
contribution of the interband transitions is compared in Fig.(1-d). The yellow dashed curves
are the predictions from the DFT calculations for m-SWCNT with diameter 1.22 nm and
with diameter 0.7 nm. The prediction from the linear surface conductivity model is shown
as the solid blue curve. While this model predicts a contribution equals to ε⊥(ω) = 1
11independently of the diameter as a result of the approximation (A1), the DFT calculations
predict radically different results as it can be observed in Fig.(1-d). They are characterized
by a plateau below the near-infrared range and displays absorption bands at higher energies.
All our results suggest that relaxing the approximation (A1) and (A2) leads to different
predictions, some being significantly different such as the plasma frequency or the transverse
component ε⊥of the dielectric tensor. We will now compare these theoretical predictions
with experimental measurements.
The m-SWCNT sample is based on HiPCO carbon nanotubes (Nano Integris). They are
sorted by column chromatography following the procedure described by Tanaka et al.22to
obtain enriched m-SWCNT suspensions. They are filtered onto nitrocellulose membranes to
form thin films which are then transferred onto calcium fluoride CaF 2substrates. Samples
are further annealed under high vacuum (10−6Torr) at 250oC for 4 hours to remove solvent
and impurities.27,32The film’s thickness, d1, is determined by Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) to be 30 ±5 nm (inset in Fig.2(b)). Raman spectra (Fig.2(a)) performed at 532
and 633 nm feature a strong peak at 1590 cm−1, the so-called G-band, typical of SWCNTs.
The broad asymmetric Fano lineshape below the G-band is a key characteristic of metallic
carbon nanotubes,42assessing the sorting quality. The inset in Fig.2(a) displays a mapping
of the intensity of the G-band, underlying in conjunction with the AFM data the nanotube
film homogeneity in terms of thickness, density, and nanotube orientation. It is important
to underline that no m-SWCNT preferential orientation inside the layer was evidenced. The
m-SWCNT diameter distribution is relatively broad but could be bracketed between 0.7 and
1.2 nm43(See supplementary material S1).
Broadband reflectance spectra are measured using a FTIR spectrometer (Bruker IFS
66v/S) adapted with a combined transmission and specular reflection apparatus from 0.02 eV
up to 0.6 eV, and a UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (Cary Varian 5000) adapted with a VW
absolute specular reflectance accessory from 0.6 eV up to 5 eV. Measurements are done at
near-normal incidence in both cases. Great care is taken to acquire the reflectance spectra

13which requires an extremely fine alignment procedure to achieve a precision on the order
of 1 %. Measurements are calibrated on materials whose optical properties are known.
Fig.2(b) displays the m-SWCNT film reflectance deposited on a CaF 2substrate (red curve),
while the bare substrate reflectance is the dotted-gray curve. The 0.7 to 3 eV range is
magnified to display the carbon nanotube excitonic transitions contribution.27,44While the
M11transitions (near 2 eV) contribute to the reflectance largely above the level due to
the substrate contribution, the S 11transitions (0.7-1.2 eV) contribute marginally to this
reflectance, underlining again sorting efficiency (see supplementary material S2 for additional
comparison of the absorption spectra before and after sorting).
The complex dielectric constant of the m-SWCNT layer is extracted from the reflectance
measurements using Kramers-Kronig relations45–47relating the phase θof a complex number
z=|z|eiθto its modulus |z|. The procedure requires the determination of the complex
Fresnel coefficient r02which describes light reflection by the m-SWCNT layer deposited on
a semi-infinite CaF 2substrate. The reflectance experiment does not measure |r02|2directly.
While thick compared to any wavelength probes in this letter, the finite size of the substrate
(d2= 1 mm) has to be taken into account, particularly in the spectral range where CaF 2is
transparent. Supplementary material S3 explains how to relate the measured reflectance R
to the quantity |r02|2.
Once the modulus |r02|and the phase θ02ofr02are known, the m-SWCNT refractive
index could be extracted by solving:
r02[˜n1(ω)] =|r02|eiθ02(ω)(7)
where r02[˜n1(ω)] is the analytical expression of the Fresnel coefficient. The unknown to be
found is the m-SWCNT complex refractive-index, ˜ n1(ω). The quantity on the right side of
Eq. (7) is derived from the experiment.
14Results and discussion
The experimental dielectric constant found from this procedure is plotted in Fig.3, real and
imaginary parts respectively on the left and right side. The experimental confidence interval
is represented by a shaded area. This area includes the uncertainties on the film thickness, the
substrate refractive index, the reflectance spectral join between the NIR / MIR range and the
evaluation of θ, the phase of the Fresnel coefficient. The main source of errors comes from the
uncertainty on the film thickness. To check the accuracy of the experimentally determined
dielectric constant, the sample transmittance was measured in the 0.05 to 4 eV range and
compared with predictions based on this experimental dielectric constant as shown in section
S4 in supplementary materials. This measurement, independent from the one used to extract
the dielectric constant, shows a good agreement with the predictions. It is a blind test to
check the consistency of the dielectric constant derived from the reflectance measurements.
We now aim at comparing the experimental optical properties of m-SWCNTs with the-
oretical predictions. Carbon nanotubes form a composite with many chiralities of metallic
nature. The composite has the geometry of a flat layer deposited on a substrate. Inside the
layer, carbon nanotubes have a complicated geometry. They are not rigid fibres being neither
perfectly straight nor aligned as shown in the AFM picture [Fig.(2-b)]. The geometry of car-
bon nanotubes’ layers has been qualified as ”tumbleweed configurations”.48Consequently, at
the microscopic scale, the layer can be understood as a succession of polycrystalline clusters
without correlations at the macroscopic scale. The layer can be seen as a powder made of
crystallites with random orientation. The crystallites’ characteristic size is roughly on the
order of one to a few tens of nanometers. They are then extremely small compared to the
wavelength and the size of the incident light beam. Consequently, the layer behaves as a
homogeneous, isotropic material under light illumination. The effective dielectric constant

In Fig.(3), we compare the experimental data (red shaded area) with either the predic-
tions from the linear surface conductivity model [Fig.3(a) and (b)] or with the results from
the DFT calculations [Fig.3(c) and (d)]. The real part and the imaginary part are shown in
Fig.3(a-c) and Fig.3(b-d), respectively.
Since neither the surface conductivity model nor the DFT calculations predict the relax-
ation time τfor the intraband transitions, it is introduced as a phenomenological parameter
in the two theories. We used the same numerical value of τ= 35 fs in the two theories.15,36,38
This value is extracted from the experimental curves from a fit with a Drude model in the
range [0.05,0.5] eV (See supplementary material S6 for more details). It is in excellent
agreement with the value given in the literature.35
While being sorted and enriched in metallic chiralities, the sample contains a distribution
of metallic nanotube species, armchair ( n,n), zigzag ( n,0) and chiral ( n,m), in the diameter
range determined from the Radial Breathing Modes study (See supplementary material S1).
To compare the experimental data with predictions, on the basis of the trends of variations
given by the two theories [see Fig(1)], we define two boundaries for the dielectric function.
The first bound is defined as:
•A chirality with a diameter close to 0.70 nm, the minimal diameter in the diameter
distribution.
•A semi-metallic chirality since the gap at low energy shifts the dielectric function
curve to higher values as compared to a metallic chirality without low-energy gap in
the infrared.
17Based on these arguments, we choose the chirality (9,0) as the first bound to compare
with the experiment. The predictions for the first bound are shown as the dashed yellow
line in Fig.(3).
The second bound is defined as:
•A chirality with a diameter close to 1.2 nm, the maximal diameter of the diameter
distribution.
•A metallic chirality without a gap at low energy.
Based on these arguments, we choose the chirality (9,9) as the second bound to compare
with the experiment. The predictions for the second bound are shown as the blue dotted
line in Fig.3.
Fig.3(a) and (b) show only a qualitative agreement with the surface conductivity model.
Indeed, it underestimates the real part of the dielectric function in the range [0.4,4] eV
and only the first bound matches with the experimental data for photon energy smaller
than 0.35 eV. On the opposite, the predictions from the ab initio calculations, shown in
Fig.3(c) and (d), bracket the experimental data for the whole energy range explored in
the experiment, except above 2.7 eV. Since the SWCNT diameter distribution is relatively
large, the individual peaks in the interband transitions originating from the band gaps, are
strongly broadened and attenuated in the experiment. In consequence, it is not possible to
measure the band-gap values from the experimental data and compare them to the theoretical
predictions.
We define a single quantifier to discriminate between the two theories: the screened
plasma frequency E⋆that can also be understood as a cut-off energy. Indeed, for photon
energy below this cut-off frequency, the m-SWCNT layer behaves as a metal. It has a
dielectric function with a negative real-part. On the opposite, above the cut-off energy, the
real part of the dielectric function is positive. Consequently, to avoid the confusion with the
plasma frequency shown in Fig.(1-c) we will denote this quantity as the ”cut-off energy”. It
18is defined as the frequency for which the real part of the dielectric function is null. It can
be extracted from the experiment and compared to the theories as shown by the purple star
and the grey line in Fig.(3-a)-Fig.(3-c). Based on Drude’s model, we show in supplementary
material S8 the relationship between the cut-off energy E⋆, the plasma frequency ωpand the
contribution of the interband transition in the axial ε∥
band the transverse polarization ε⊥
b
evaluated at the cut-off energy. It reads:
E⋆=ℏs
ω2
p
ε∥
b+ 2ε⊥
b−γ2 (9)
Except for the loss rate γthat is considered to be the same in the two theories, all
other quantities differ as unambiguously shown by the theoretical study and highlighted in
Fig.(1-c) and Fig.(1-d). Based on Eq.(9) the cut-off energy can be considered as an excellent
quantifier to discriminate the two theories.
The experimental value of the cut-off energy is E⋆= 0.55±0.03 eV. It is compared with
the predictions given by the linear conductivity model and the DFT calculations in Fig.4.
This figure displays E⋆as a function of m-SWCNT diameter. Experimental results are
represented as a red shaded area, with a confidence interval of ±0.03 eV. DFT calculations
for various chiralities inside the experimental diameter distribution are represented by yellow
circles, while values predicted by the linear surface conductivity model are represented by
blue squares. The upper bound is given by the chirality (9,9) in the two theories, while the
lower bound is given by the chirality (9,0).
The experimental value is clearly within the interval defined by the DFT calculations
and clearly outside the values predicted by the surface conductivity model, its lowest value
being 0.17 eV too high. It is very close to the predictions for chiralities (6,6) and (7,7) made
by the DFT calculations, which more or less fall in the middle of the experimental diameter
distribution.
To summarize, the cut-off energy as a quantifier proves unambiguously that the predic-
19tions from DFT calculations are more likely in agreement with the experiment, the linear
conductivity surface model over-estimating the cut-off energy by 5 standard deviations. This
discrepancy can be understood based on Eq.(9). As shown in Fig.(1-c), DFT calculations
predict smaller values of the plasma frequency than the surface conductivity model in the
whole diameter range probed in this study. The difference in the plasma frequency predic-
tions is a consequence of the relaxing of the set of assumptions (A2) performed by the linear
surface conductivity model. The curvature radius of carbon nanotube not only leads to band
gap at low energy but also has an effect on the value of the plasma frequency ωp. Further-
more, according to Eq.(9), the quantity ε⊥
balso contributes to a decrease of the cut-off energy
as compared to the plasma frequency due to screening. Following Fig.(1-d), the decrease is
expected to be more important for the DFT calculations than for the surface conductivity
model since this model assumes that carbon nanotubes are non-polarisable objects in the
plane transverse to the nanotube axis. This result highlights that the approximation (A1) is
too crude to describe the optical properties of carbon nanotubes. Last but not least, DFT
calculations take into account the curvature-induced low-energy gap existing in non-armchair
SWCNT while the surface conductivity model does not. As observed in Fig.4, it leads to
higher E⋆for zigzag and chiral compared to armchair nanotubes, independently of the di-
ameter effect. Consequently, it could not explain the discrepancy between the measurement
and the predictions of the surface conductivity model which is mainly due to the failure of
the approximation (A1) and the magnitude of the plasma frequency.
Conclusion
We reported the measurement of the complex dielectric constant of metallic carbon nan-
otubes films over a wide range of energies ( 0.05 to 4 eV) and the comparison with predic-
tions from two theoretical models. This allowed us to investigate intraband transitions in
m-SWCNT and in particular to extract the cut-off frequency E⋆= 0.55±0.03 eV, below

which a m-SWCNT film behaves like a metal. Based on this quantity, we highlight a correct
agreement with DFT calculations and exclude prediction based on the analytical model. A
similar conclusion was reached for graphene.52The assumptions performed in the analytical
model15are too crude to describe correctly the optical properties of m-SWCNT. Our method-
ology strengthens the need for ab initio calculations to predict accurately the electronic and
optical properties of SWCNT, which could have consequences for several applications in
