 ABSTRACT  
Copper sulfide (CuS) has garnered significant attention in various fields of application due to 
its unique electronic, optical, and catalytic features. In this study, we present the chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) -based synthesis of ultrathin CuS crystals as thin as 14 nm with lateral sizes 
up to 60 ¬µm. The structure, morphology, and composition of the as -synthesized CuS crystals 
were thoroughly characterize d. Among our results, we measured the first -order temperature 
coefficients of Raman shifts of CuS. Moreover, we showed that CuS crystals exhibited an 
unexpected second harmonic generation (SHG), which is attributed to the presence of defects 
in the CuS lat tice. Our results suggest that single crystalline CuS possesses a considerable 
potential for nonlinear optical applications in conjunction with its current applications in 
electronics and catalysis.

 Introduction  
Copper sulfide  (CuS) is an interest ing binary compound owing to its exceptional optical, 
electronic, and catalytic characteristics. [1-6] It is a multifaceted material  that manifests in 
diverse crystal structure s, such as hexagonal covellite and orthorhombic anilite, among 
others. [7-10] The distinctive attributes of CuS crystals have resulted in a diverse range of 
applications, including but not limited to energy storage sensors, photovoltaic devices, and 
thermoelectric devices. [11-15] The crystals of CuS exhibit remarkable optical characteristics, 
such as elevated quantum yields of photoluminescence and exceptional abs orption of visible 
light. The material's robust light absorption properties have been utilized in various photovoltaic 
devices, including but not limited to dye -sensitized solar cells and thin -film solar cells, to 
optimize their efficiency. [16, 17]  Wet-chemistry techniques have been employed to synthesize 
CuS nanoparticles, which exhibit c onsiderable potential as lithium /magnesium -ion battery 
components owing to their superior energy storage capabilities. [18, 19]  Furthermore, the 
photocatal ytic characteristics of CuS have been investigated, wherein its considerable specific 
surface area has been identified as a pivotal factor in augmenting photocatalytic efficacy. [20] 
The characteristic feature of CuS renders it a viable contender for deployment in the domains 
of environmental remediation and hydrogen ge neration via water el ectrolysis. As reported by 
As reported by Fan et al. the  light-harvesting and charge dissociation functionalities of 
heterostructure d ZnIn 2S4/CuS nanosheets can be considerably enhanced without requiring  a co-
catalyst. [21] The observed im provement can be attributed to the robust interplay between the 
assembled p -n heterostructures, which effectively promotes the transfer and separation of 
charges. Zhu et al. recently showed the outstanding efficiency of CuS in the oxygen evolution 
reaction , exhibiting minimal overpotential and exceptional electrolytic endurance. [22] 
Although there are many reports on the energy storage and photocatalysis applications of CuS, 
its physicochemical properties have not been thoroughly investigated. Consequently, a plethora 4 
 of unexplored possibilities exist for uncovering novel  CuS characte ristics and uses in diverse 
domains, including energy conversion and storage, sensing, and optoelectronics. Further 
exploration of the characteristics of CuS and its analogous compounds has the potential to 
facilitate significant progress in the field of m aterials science and the innovation of advanced 
technologies.  
In this work, CuS crystals were synthesized using a single -step CVD technique at a 
relatively low temperature of 600 ¬∞C. The as -synthesized CuS crystal‚Äôs structural, 
morphological, a nd compositional features were thoroughly characterized. Intriguingly, these 
CuS crystals exhibited an unexpected second harmonic generation (SHG), which is attributed 
to the presence of defects or lattice distortions within the CuS crystal structure. Such  lattice 
imperfections led to a breaking of the intrinsic centrosymmetric nature of CuS crystals, which 
resulted in the SHG response. The as -synthesized CuS crystal, with its unexpected SHG 
response and defect -related properties, may pave the way for novel  nonlinear optical materials 
that can be employed in various applications across multiple fields, including photonics, 
telecoms, and sensing technologies .5 
 Results and Discussion  
Copper(I) chloride (CuCl) powder was opted as the Cu source for growth of CuS crystals, due 
to its relatively low melting point temperature. A small, asymmetric crucible was chosen to this 
end, filled with scant amount of CuCl powder, and put in middle of tubular CVD furnace as can 
be seen in the schematic setup in the supporting in formation (Figure S1). During the synthesis 
process, the optimum growth temperature was found to be about 600 ¬∞C, lower than the other 
CVD synthesis of copper -based chalcogenides .[23, 24]  Additional information regarding the 
CVD growth process is provided in the experimental section. Figure 1a  shows a typical optical 
micrograph of CuS crystals grown on a mica. The latera l length of the grown ultrathin CuS 
crystals can be up to 60 ¬µm ( Figure 1b ). Mica is used as a substrate because of its atomic -level 
smooth and inert surface, which has been widely reported as a favorable substrate for ultrathin 
material synthesis. [25, 26]  We used different substrates for comparison and substrate effect 
influence, including SiO 2 and bare Si, and found that mica worked best in terms of crystal 
homogeneity, thickness, and size. Figure S2 shows the results of the as-grown CuS crystals on 
several substrates.  Atomic force microscopy (A FM) height trace map given in Figure 1c  
confirms that the surface of CuS is very smooth and the thickness of the studied crystal is found 
to be about 14 nm. The X -ray diffraction (XRD) Œ∏ -2Œ∏ scan of the transferred CuS crystals on 
the SiO 2/Si substrate, shown in  Figure 1d , unambiguously corresponds to the hexagonal phase 
of CuS (PDF No. 06 -0464). [27] The pronounced characteristic peaks corresponding to the (002), 
(006), and (008) planes indicate that CuS crystals predominantly grow along the basal plane 
(00l). To further investigate the crystallographic orientation of the CuS crystals, electron 
backsc atter diffraction (EBSD) was used. This technique is highly effective in characterizing 
the microstructure of materials. [28, 29]  As seen in Figure 1e , the EBSD inverse pole figure 
(IPF) map exhibits  a consistent color contrast within the hexagonal domains along the basal 
plane of CuS ([00l] direction). This observation implies that the hexagonal CuS crystal 6 
 possesses a single -crystalline nature and a well -ordered in -plane orientation, which is in 
agreement with the XRD findings. However, the pole figure (PF) corresponding to the (0001) 
projection plane ( Figure 1f ) reveals an impaired [0001] out -of-plane orientation. This finding 
suggests the existence of defects or lattice distortions within the CuS crystal structure, which 
may influence its properties .[22, 30]

Raman spectroscopy with a 532 nm excitation laser was used to investigate the intrinsic 
properties and ide ntify the fingerprint of the CuS crystal structure. As shown in Figure 2a, the 
Raman spectrum  of the  CuS crystal show s four distinct Raman peaks at 90.1, 130, 279, and 471 
7 
 cm-1, representing E2g, A1, Eg1, and A1 modes, respectively. Among these peaks, the strong 
characteristic peak at 471.0 cm-1 can be attributed to the stretching mode of the S -S bond, 
corresponding to the S 2 groups of the recognized crystal structure of CuS lattice. The spatially 
resolved Raman mapping images ( Figure 2b ) of the four characteristic peaks (60, 138, 267, 
and 471 cm-1) exhibit uniformity throughout the crystalline sheet of CuS. Temperature -
dependent Raman spectroscopy is employed to study the atomic bonding and thermal expansion 
of the crystals .[31] Figure 2c  shows the typical temperature -dependent Raman spectra for the 
grown CuS crystal at temperatures ranging from 80 to 300 K. Temperature -dependent Ra man 
spectroscopy of CuS cr ystal  provi des valuable information about its  thermal behavior as 
vibrational modes in its lattice structure. The relationship between temperature and CuS Raman 
modes can be expressed through a linear equation: ùúî(ùëá) = ùúî0 +ùúíùëá, where ùúî0, T, and œá are 
the Raman peak position at 0 K, the Kelvin temperature, and the first -order temperature 
coefficient, respective ly. Raman modes at 60, 138, 267, and 471 cm-1 labeled P1, P2, P3, and 
P4 each exhibit temperature coefficients (œá -values) that fall within the following parameters: -
0.00662, -0.02677, 0.025673, and 0.02535 cm-1 K-1 respectively. Negative œá -values indicate 
that Raman mode frequencies decrease with temperature increases, suggesting an anharmonic 
behavior of lattice vibrations. The P1 mode exhibits relatively lower anharmonic behavior than 
other modes, suggesting temperature variations may affect it less signi ficant as, P2, P3, and P4 
modes showed larger negative œá values suggesting stronger anharmonic behavior ( Figure 2d ). 
This evidence suggests that these modes are susceptible to temperature variations and that 
thermal expansion or changes in bonding strength  in response to temperature changes may have 
an impact. [32, 33]  Also, previo us studies have shown that the dominant temperature coefficient 
of low -dimensional materials is linked to the van der Waals interaction between layers, and this 
is often used to explain why the Raman peak shifting changes with temperature. [34-36] The œá-
values mentioned above offer valuable information regarding the  thermal characteristics of CuS, 8 
 which could facilitate comprehension of its properties and potential utilization in devices that 
are sensitive to temperature.

High -resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR -TEM), selected -area electron 
diffraction (SAED), and energy -dispersive X -ray spectroscopy (EDX) were all employed to 
better comprehend the CuS crystal's structure and composition. Figure 3a  displays the results 
of an HR -TEM that utilized Fast Fourier Transform filtering to get a precise image of the atomic 
9 
 arrangement in the CuS crystal. The image showed a highly organized structure, with atoms 
arranged in a regular hexagonal lattice. Notably, between two  intersecting planes at 120¬∞, 
representing crystallographic planes (100) and (010) of the hexagonal crystal structure, the 
interplanar gap measured 0.35 nm. This verified that the CuS material indeed has the predicted 
hexagonal crystal structure. The SAED structural analysis ( Figure 3b ) revealed a 6 -fold 
symmetric diffraction pattern along the [001] zone axis, consistent with the HR -TEM results. 
Consistent with the pole figure,  the SAED pattern shows evidence of a superlattice or stacking 
fault in the CuS c rystal, with a sec ondary 6 -fold symmetry  (lesser intensity with some of the 
spots highlighted in a red circle). Such phenomena have been widely reported to exist in various 
low-dimensional materials. [37-40] Complementary to the structural analyses, EDX elemental 
analysis was used to determine the CuS crystal's atomic composition ( Figure 3c ). The EDX 
analysis showed that the sample contained both Cu and S. Elemental mapping ( Figure 3d ) also 
showed that Cu and S atoms were evenly distributed across the crystal, confirming the 
stoichiome tric distribution of the  elements in  CuS crystals.  Moreover, X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to determine the chemical composition and the surface 
electronic states of as -obtained crystal s. As shown in Figure 3e , the Cu 2p peaks are 
deconvoluted into two separate overlapping doublet peaks using the Gaussian fitting curves. 
The doublets are attributed to Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 of the Cu2+ oxidation states. The peaks at 
binding energies of 931.9 eV (Cu 2p 3/2) and 951.6 eV (Cu 2p 1/2) belo ng to the Cu2+ oxidation 
state in the pure CuS crystal. While the remaining two peaks at binding energies of 933.4 eV 
and 953.6 eV correspond to Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 in Cu 1-xS, indicating that defects may exist 
in the crystals. [41, 42]  Besides, the peaks centered at binding energies of 164.5 eV and 166.5 
eV are ascribed to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2, respectively ( Figure 3f ). 10

Next, we focus on the Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) of the CuS. SHG is an 
effective approach to investigate physical phenomena associated with crystal symmetry, and 
has an exceptional sensitivity to materials' electronic and structural properties. [43-46] The 
centrosymmetric crystal structure of CuS may be disrupted by various factors such as defects 
or stalking faults, which could lead to the formation of multi -oriented domains within the crystal, 
and ultimately trigger a SHG response. [47, 48]  The results of our EB SD, SEAD, and XPS 
11 
 analyses indicate the presence of structural defects within the CuS lattice. These defects may 
be responsible for disrupting the crystal's centrosymmetry. Thus, SHG was utilized to 
corroborate it further.  The SHG mechanism is depicted in Figure 4a , where the incident laser 
(œâ) generates an (2œâ) response. The SHG response of an as -synthesized CuS crystal  under 
various incident laser wavelengths from the edge of visible light to near -infrared (760 to 1020 
nm) is presented in Figure 4 b, which shows a wide spectrum response with distinct wavelength 
selectiv ity. Moreover, the SHG mappings  display a uniform r esponse througho ut the entire  CuS 
lattice  (Figure 4b inset) . Evolution of SHG intensity with changing incident laser power  was 
also further systematically investigated . With increasing the incident laser power from 0.7 to 
1.6 mW under 800 nm laser excitation, the intensity of the SHG signal at 400 nm exhibits 
significant enhancement ( Figure 4c ). The relationship between SHG intensity and laser power 
was fitted linearly in the log -log coordinate, as displayed in Figure 4d . Interestingly, the slope 
of 2.05 is close t o the theoretical value of 2 calculated from the electric dipole theory. [49]  
Before assessing polarization, we rotated the sample to a position where the highest 
SHG response could be generated by setting the initial azimuthal angle to 0¬∞. In parallel (XX) 
and perpendicular (XY) directions, the typical 6 -fold symmetry pattern fitte d proportionally 
with sin23ùúÉ and cos23ùúÉ can be detected, as presented in Figure 4e -f. A similar set of SHG 
studies was conducted on a different CuS crystal exhibiting different morphology, which 
demonstrated a commensurate SHG response, as illustrated in  Figure S3. It implied broken 
inversion symmetry that is characteristic of hexagonal -symmetric structures similar to other 
SHG sensitive materials. Due to this unique quality, CuS crystal possesses several intriguing 
features with considerable application potential in the field of nonlinear optics. Thus, CuS 
crystal's promise in nonlinear optics increases the variety of materials available for these 
applications and presents new avenues for investigation into improving its performance and 
uncovering unantic ipated capabilities.  12

Conclusion  
In conclusion, CuS crystals were successfully synthesized for the first time using a single -step 
CVD technique. The as -grown CuS crystals were characterized and crystals as thin as14 nm up 
to a lateral size of up to 60 ¬µm are demonstrated. Temperature depe ndence of Raman shifts are 
measured. An unexpected SHG response was observed in the as -synthesized CuS crystal owing 
to the presence of intrinsic defects in the lattice structure. These defects caused a breakdown in 
local symmetry in the CuS lattice, there by revealing the material's SHG behavior. Our findings 
13 
 suggest that CuS could find new uses in nonlinear optical applications beyond its current 
utilization in catalysis and electronics.  
Materials and Characterization  
CVD growth:  CuS crystals were grown in  a tubular furnace with a single temperature zone and 
atmospheric pressure CVD conditions. A quartz boat  containing a CuCl powder (97 %, Sigma 
Aldrich ) was placed in the middle of the temperature zone. S powder (99 .5%, Sigma Al drich ) 
was inserted at the ups tream end of the tube, and the temperature was maintained at 200. 
Substrates, e.g., cleaved fluorphlogopite mica, were positioned 8 cm apart from the furnace's 
center in the downstream position. The tube was pumped and cleaned with 500 sccm Ar flow 
to drai n air prior to heating. Then, the furnace was heated to 600 ¬∞C at a rate of  30 ‚Å∞C/min  using  
steady  50 sccm Ar as the carrier gas, and it was held at that temperature for 30 minutes. After 
the procedure was concluded, the furnace was allowed to cool naturally.  
Characterizations:  CuS crystal morphologies were examined using an OM (BX51, 
OLYMPUS) and an AFM (Bruker Dimension Icon). The crystalline structure, orientation, and 
composition were investigated using XRD ( Œª: 1.54 √Ö, D2 phaser, Bruker), XPS (AXIS -ULTRA 
DLD -600W, Kratos), EBSD (FEI Quanta650), and TEM (Tecnai G30 F30, FEI). Raman 
spectra were acquired using a confocal Raman system (Alpha 300R, WITe c) equipped with a 
532 nm laser.  
SHG measurements:  SHG measurements were performed in an (alpha300RS+, WITec) 
Raman system with a reflection mode under normal incidence excitation using a femtosecond 
laser as the excitation source . A mode -locked Ti: sapphire laser with a pulse d uration of 140 fs 
and repetition rate of 80 MHZ generated the output laser with a continually varying wavelength 
ranging from 340 nm to 1600 nm, which was then filtered into an optical parametric oscillator 
(Chameleon Compact OPO -Vis). A dichroic beam spli tter was used to reflect the laser beam 14 
 into the 100x objective lens with a spot size of roughly 1.8 Œºm and communicate the reflected 
SHG signal. The reflected SHG signal was then filtered with a short pass (SP) filter before 
being sent to the spectrometer  and CCD. The collected polarized SHG signal was sent through 
a linear polarized analyzer for SHG polarization measurement by rotati ng the sample with a 
step of 10 ¬∞ relative to fixed light polarization. All experiments were carried out in a natural 
setting .
