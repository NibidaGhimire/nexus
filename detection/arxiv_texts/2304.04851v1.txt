arXiv:2304.04851v1  [math.AP]  10 Apr 2023DEGENERATE FOURIER TRANSFORM ASSOCIATED WITH
THE STURM-LIOUVILLE OPERATOR
A. V. Gorshkov
Most of the known Fourier transforms associated with the equa tions of mathematical
physics have a trivial kernel, and an inversion formula as we ll as the Parseval equality are
fulﬁlled. In other words, the system of the eigenfunctions i nvolved in the deﬁnition of the
integral transform is complete.
However, in some cases, the diﬀerential operator, in additio n to the continuous part of
the spectrum that deﬁnes this transform, may contain a set of ei genfunctions {ek}, and the
Parseval’s equality takes the form
/bardblf/bardbl2=/bardblF[f]/bardbl2+/summationdisplay
k(f,ek)2, (1)
where{ek}become the elements of the kernel of F. In that case Fwill be called as a
degenerate transform .
For example, the sine-Fourier transform
ˆf(λ) =/radicalbigg
2
π/integraldisplay∞
0sin(λs)f(s)ds
is based on the eigen functions of A=d2/dx2inL2(0,∞)with the Dirichlet condition
f(0) = 0 . The spectrum of the operator is continuous and ﬁlls the enti re negative half-axis:
σc= (−∞,0]. This transform is not degenerate, and the inversion formul a has the form
f(x) =2
π/integraldisplay∞
0sin(λx)/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay∞
0sin(λs)f(s)ds/parenrightbigg
dλ.
Functions ϕ(x,λ) = sin(λx)are the generalized eigenfunctions (i.e. not belonging to the
main space L2(0,∞), where the operator is set):
∂xxϕ(x,λ) =−λ2ϕ(x,λ).
Similarly, the same operator with the Neumann condition genera tes a cosine Fourier
transform. However, this operator with a Robin boundary cond itionf′(0) +af(0) = 0
witha >0, in addition to its generalized eigen functions contains an ordinary eigenfunction
e−axwith an eigenvalue of a2. Its spectrum consists of a continuous part σc= (−∞,0]
and an eigenvalue λ=a2. The Fourier transform generated by this operator will alre ady
have a nontrivial kernel containing this function (see, for example, [1]). However, the mixed
boundary condition with a >0refers to non-physical , and, as a rule, is not considered in
diﬀerential equations.
Another important example of a family of operators with degener ate transform are
∆k=1
r∂
∂r/parenleftbigg
r∂
∂r/parenrightbigg
−k2
r2, k∈R.
For integers k, these operators are the Fourier coeﬃcients of the Laplacian when decomposed
into a Fourier series by an angular variable in polar coordin ates.
These operators with a mixed boundary condition
r0∂w(t,r)
∂r/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
r=r0±kw(t,r0) = 0
1in addition to the continuous spectrum σc= (−∞,0)also have an eigenvalue λ= 0from the
kernel of ∆k(herer0>0is a ﬁxed number that can be treated as the radius of the circle ).
The eigenfunctions from the kernel are 1/r±k(for certain values of k). They also produce
a degenerate transformation, which is a generalization of th e integral Weber transform, the
properties of which were investigated by the author in [2].
And these transforms, precisely as a degenerate ones, had fou nd an application in math-
ematical physics. With its help, the author obtained a soluti on to the Stokes problem in
the exterior of the circle (see [3]). All this conﬁrms the impor tance of such a degenerate
transforms not only for the theory of functions, but also as ha ving signiﬁcant practical
importance.
Let the Sturm-Liouville operator Af(x) =f′′−q(x)f, deﬁned on the semiaxis x∈(0,∞),
have a spectrum σ(A), which consists of a continuous part E⊂R, and no bigger than a
countable set of eigenvalues {λk}of the ﬁnite multiplicity with eigenfunctions {ek}. As is
known([1][4]), if q(x)is continuous on R+, then there exist the generalized eigenfunctions
ϕ(x,λ)specifying the Fourier transform
F[f] =/integraldisplay∞
0ϕ(x,λ)f(x)dx, Aϕ(x,λ) =λϕ(x,λ).
At the same time, there is a spectral function ρ(λ)such that F[f]belong to the space L2
with the weight ρ(λ):F[f]∈L2(E,ρ(λ)).
Deﬁnition 1. Let’s call the functions ϕ(x,λ)to be orthonormal, denoting as (ϕ(·,λ),ϕ(·,ζ))
=δ(λ−ζ)if
ˆf(λ) =/integraldisplay∞
0ϕ(x,λ)/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay
Eϕ(x,ζ)ˆf(ζ)dρ(ζ)/parenrightbigg
dx (2)
for any function ˆf(λ)of the form ˆf(λ) =F[f(·)](λ),f(x)∈L2(R+).
Equality in this deﬁnition follows from the formal applying o f theδ-function δ(λ−ζ)to
ˆf(λ).
Deﬁnition 2. We will say that {{ϕ(·,λ)},{ek}}is a complete orthonormal system of
eigenfunctions of the operator Aif(ϕ(·,λ),ϕ(·,ζ)) =δ(λ−ζ),(ϕ(·,λ),ek)L2(R+)= 0,
(ek,ej)L2(R+)=δk,jfor anyλ,ζ∈E, any eigenfunctions ek,ej, and the Parseval equal-
ity (1) holds.
The condition (ϕ(·,λ),ek)L2(R+)= 0means that Fis the degenerate transform, i.e.
F[ek] = 0.
Theorem 1. Let the Sturm-Liouville operator Abe a generator of a strongly continuous
semigroup etAinL2(0,∞); its spectrum is real, bounded from above, consists of a continuou s
part and no bigger than a countable set of eigenvalues {ek}, and the resolvent satisﬁes the
estimate /bardblR(A,λ)/bardbl ≤C/λwith some C >0. Then the system of its eigen functions forms
a complete orthonormal system and the following inversion formula ho lds:
f(x) =/integraldisplay
Eϕ(x,λ)/parenleftBigg/integraldisplay
R+ϕ(s,λ)f(s)ds/parenrightBigg
f(x)dρ(λ)+/summationdisplay
k(f,ek)ek. (3)
Proof. Consider the boundary value problem in L2(R+):
∂ty(t,x)−Ay= 0,y(0,x)=f(x).
Using the estimate on the resolvent R(A,λ)from the conditions of the theorem, the
solution y(t,x) =etAof this equation can be given by the formula
y(t,x) =1
2πi/integraldisplay
γeλtR(A,λ)f(x)dλ,
2where the contour γcovers the real spectrum of the operator A. In the case of an unbounded
spectrum γis the boundary of the sector Sa,θ={λ∈C,|arg(λ−a)|> θ}with some a >0,
θ∈(π
2,π).
The resolvent has a gap along the set E, and the points λkare its poles. Integral
Pk=1
2πi/integraldisplay
|λ−λk|=εR(A,λ)dλ
for a suﬃciently small εis a ﬁnite-dimensional projector onto the proper subspace Ek(see
[5]). And then the solution takes the following form:
y(t,x) =1
2πi/integraldisplay
Eeλt(R(A,λ−i·0)−R(A,λ+i·0))f(x)dλ+/summationdisplay
keλkt(f,ek)ek.
The integral in the last equality deﬁnes a family of projector s on the generalized proper
subspace [1] and can be expressed in terms of the eigenfunctio nsϕ(x,λ), giving the ﬁnal
formula for y(t,x):
y(t,x) =/integraldisplay

Let’s prove the inversion formula (3). Then it will follow th e completeness of the eigen
functions. Since Ais the generator of the strongly continuous semigroup etA, theny(t,·)
→f(x)strongly at t→0. If the set of the continuous spectrum Eis bounded, then passing
to the limit at t→0is allowed under the sign of the integral in (4) and the invers ion formula
is proved. If Eis not bounded, then we must justify the limit transition at t→0. It is
enough to prove the validity of a limit transition only in the i ntegral part of the equality
(4). Let’s prove weak convergence at t→0:

Take an arbitrary g∈C∞
0(r0,∞). Thenˆg(λ) =F[g(·)](λ)will decrease rapidly by λ.
The following is true
Proposition 1. For an arbitrary g∈C∞
0(r0,∞)holdsλˆg(λ)∈L2(E,ρ(λ)).
Proof. SinceAϕ=λϕ, then
ˆg(λ) =/integraldisplay∞

0A[ϕ(x,λ)]g(x)dx=1

0ϕ(x,λ)A[g(x)]dx.
Because A[g(x)]∈L2(R+), then/integraltext∞
0ϕ(x,λ)A[g(x)]dx∈L2(E,ρ(λ))and the proposition is
proved.

From the uniqueness of the weak limit, taking into account y(t,·)→f(·), the inversion
formula is valid almost everywhere
f(·) =F∗[F[f]]+/summationdisplay
k(f,ek)ek, (5)
which is the same formula as (3).
Let’s prove that ek∈Ker(F):
/integraldisplay∞
0ϕ(x,λ)ek(x)dx=1

0A[ϕ(x,λ)]ek(x)dx=1
λ/integraldisplay∞
0ϕ(x,λ)Aek(x)dx
=λk
λ/integraldisplay∞
0ϕ(x,λ)ek(x)dx,
which implies F[ek] = 0.
The orthogonality condition (2) follows from the inversion formula (5) if we apply the
transform Fto the latter:
ˆf=F/bracketleftBig
F∗ˆf/bracketrightBig
.
The Parseval equality (1) follows from the inversion formul a (3) in virtue of the orthonor-
mality of {{ϕ(·,λ)},{ek}}. The theorem is proved.
