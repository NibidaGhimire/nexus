Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, combin ed with ﬁrst principle and coupled self-
consistent Poisson-Schr¨ odinger calculations, we demons trate that potassium (K) atoms adsorbed
on the low-temperature phase of 1 T-TiSe2induce the creation of a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) and quantum conﬁnement of its charge-density-wave ( CDW) at the surface. By further
changing the K coverage, we tune the carrier-density within the 2DEG that allows us to nullify,
at the surface, the electronic energy gain due to exciton con densation in the CDW phase while
preserving a long-range structural order. Our study consti tutes a prime example of a controlled
exciton-related many-body quantum state in reduced dimens ionality by alkali-metal dosing.
Layered metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) form the ideal platform for studying charge den-
sity wave (CDW) instabilities at the quasi-two dimen-
sional (2D) limit as well as their interplay with Mott
states and superconductivity [1–3]. The 2 ×2×2 com-
mensurate CDW that occursat ∼200K in the prominent
TMD 1T-TiSe2is a representative case of a many-body
state whose strong entanglement of the electronic and
structural parts of the order parameter makes the deter-
minationofitsdrivingforcehighlycomplex. Fordecades,
the origin of the CDW has been under debate between a
purelyelectronicexcitonicinsulator(EI)scenarioandthe
Peierls mechanism of electron-phonon coupling [4]. More
recently, a cooperative exciton-phonon mechanism has
emerged as the most likely explanation of the CDW phe-
nomenology in 1 T-TiSe2[5, 6], encompassing both ob-
served phonon and exciton softenings [7, 8]. Yet, despite
the increasing number of theoretical approaches employ-
ing such a scenario [5, 6, 9–12], experimental attempts of
disentangling the coupled electronic and structural facets
of the CDW state mainly focus on the ultrafast time do-
main and their distinct out-of-equilibrium dynamics [13–
23].
In this letter, we use a thermodynamic phase control
approach, namely electron doping brought on by low-
temperaturealkaliatomsadsorptionatthe 1 T-TiSe2sur-
face. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES), ﬁrst principle and coupled self-consistent
Poisson-Schr¨ odinger (PS) calculations, we demonstrate
that the electron-doped1 T-TiSe2surfacesupportsa two-
dimensional electron gas (2DEG) coexisting with the
quantum-conﬁned CDW. The carrier density within the
2DEG further serves as a tuning knob to control theCoulomb screening in the surface quantum well and as
a means to follow a doping-driven thermal separation of
the excitonic and structural subsystems of the 2D CDW
[24, 25]. Our study highlights how the electronic band
structures of exciton-related materials are aﬀected by
electrical tuning induced by alkali-metal dosing.
The 1T-TiSe2single crystals were grown by chemi-
cal vapor transport at 590 ℃, therefore containing less
than 0.20 % of native Ti impurities [26–28]. Clean sur-
faces were obtained after cleaving in ultrahigh vacuum
at room temperature (RT). Potassium (K) atoms were
evaporated in situfrom a carefully outgassed SAES get-
ter source onto the freshly cleaved TiSe 2surfaces kept
at∼40 K to inhibit K intercalation [25, 29]. During the
K evaporation, the pressure was maintained below 5 ×
10−10mbar. The ARPESmeasurementswerecarriedout
using a Scienta Omicron DA30 photoelectron analyzer
with monochromatised He-I and II radiations ( hν=21.2
eV, 40.8 eV, Specs GmbH) and laser excitation source
(hν=6.3 eV, APE GmbH). The total energy resolution
was 5 meV and the base pressure during experiments
was better than 1.5 ×10−10mbar.

mission spectrum mainly consists of one component at
18.4 eV binding energy (BE) associated with dispersed
K atoms on the surface. With increased coverages, the
dispersed phase quickly saturates and a second compo-
nent corresponding to closely-packed K atoms continu-
ously grows on the low BE side (17.9 eV BE) and starts2

12×12 nm2constant-current STM images of the pristine
[Fig. 1b)] and of a 0.33 ML K-covered surface [Fig. 1c)]
[31], shows that the dispersed and close-packed forms of
the K atoms are moreover randomly distributed, with-
out surface reconstructions, as conﬁrmed by the corre-
sponding low-energy electron diﬀraction (LEED) mea-
surements showing the typical 1 ×1 hexagonal pattern
with an increased diﬀuse background for the K-covered
surface. Figures 1d) and 1e) respectively show large-
energy scale ARPES intensity maps taken at T = 40
K along the ¯M-¯Γ-¯Mand¯Γ-¯M-¯Γ directions of the surface
Brillouin zone (BZ) [Fig. 1f)] of the pristine (left-hand
side), and the 0.14 ML K-covered (right-hand side) 1 T-
TiSe2surfaces. Density-functional theory (DFT) band
structures calculations obtained from 6-layers slabs are
presented for comparison [Fig. 1g)] (see SM). A theoret-
ical 0.125 ML K-covered 1 T-TiSe2surface has been con-
sidered using a 2 ×4 K adlayer. Upon K adsorption, thetwo outer Se-Ti-Se layers on each side of the slab have
been allowed to relax whereas the two inner ones have
been ﬁxed to the relaxed positions of the CDW phase
of pristine 1 T-TiSe2. As expected from the highly elec-
tropositive character of K, the charge density diﬀerence
indicatesthatuponadsorptiontheTiSe 2surfacelayerbe-
comes strongly electron-doped. According to our Bader
analysis [32], each K adatom gives 0.7 e−to the ﬁrst Se
layer,ingoodagreementwithourexperimentallyvalueof
∼0.6e−/K atom (see SM). Overall, the DFT-calculated
unfolded band dispersions reproduce the main spectro-
scopic features of the ARPES intensity maps of both the
pristine and the K-doped surfaces very well, namely, the
bands binding energies, the eﬀective masses, as well as
the spectral weights [Fig. 1d)-e)]. In the pristine CDW
phase, the Ti 3 dz2electron band of non-bonding charac-
ter at¯Mdetermines the low-energy physics of 1 T-TiSe2
[33], but is decoupled from the CDW energetics since
it lies within the CDW gap which is opened at higher3
energies between the hybridized Se 4 px,yhole band and
the so-called ”Mexican–hat”-shaped unoccupied electron
band [see the vertical red arrows on Fig. 1d)-e)] [34–36].
Additionally, DFT tracksthe maineﬀects experimentally
observed upon K adsorption. The Ti 3 dz2electron band
at¯Mis shifted below the Fermi level ( EF) and back-
folded hole bands characteristic of the 2 ×2 CDW order
are present. Looking more closely at the changes both in
the experimental and DFT band structures, we see that
the K-adsorption gives rise to new electronic states at ¯Γ
and¯M[see the horizontal black arrows on Fig. 1d)-e)]
that seem to have been pulled down from the Se 4 px,y,
Ti 3dz2, and Mexican-hat bulk-band edges, and whose
origin will now be addressed.
Firstly, our layer-projected DFT band structures re-
veal that they are localized in the topmost surface layer
without any sign of interlayer hybridization (see SM),
demonstrating their purely 2D character. Next, simi-
larly to a DFT study of K-covered Bi 2Se3surfaces [37],
we have extracted the change induced by the K adsorp-
tion in the laterally averaged eﬀective potential of the
slab (see SM). The resulting potential exhibits two con-
tributions, an adsorbate-speciﬁc surface dipole layer re-
sponsible for the strong work function decrease of ∼3.6
eV at the highest coverage (see SM), superimposed on
a more long-range band-bending potential of ∼0.3 eV
in depth that extends over roughly 15 ˚A into the bulk
[Fig. 2a)], and acts as a near-surface conﬁnement well
for electrons. As we conﬁrm later, this leads to the for-
mation of a 2DEG at the surface and to the emergence of
quantum-well sub-band states (QWS) such as the one of
the original kz-dispersing bulk Ti 3 dz2state at∼0.1 eV
BE[Fig. 2b)], thatappearssharpandwith astrongspec-
tralweight in experiment [Fig. 2c)]. In the same way, the
Mexican-hat shaped band that crosses EFand the new
holebandwhichliesat ∼0.15eVBEat ¯Γ[Fig. 2d)], origi-
natefromsurfacequantumconﬁnementofthebulkCDW
states. Consistent with this, the latter is backfolded to
¯M[Fig. 2b)], and has its experimental counterparts in
the ARPES intensity maps at ∼0.20 eV BE both at ¯M
and¯Γ [Fig. 2c)-e)].
Importantly, compared to the Ti 3 dz2-derived QWS
whose energy shift with respect to its associated bulk-
band only depends on the 2DEG density, those of the
CDW-related QWS also include the eﬀects of a reduced
amplitudeofthesurfaceperiodiclatticedistortion(PLD)
and the associated Ti −dand Se−phybridization. This is
manifested in our DFT calculations by the smaller band
gap of the surface-conﬁned CDW band gap compared
to the bulk [see the red arrow on Fig. 2d)]. In the
experiment, we cannot access the CDW gap since the
Mexican-hat mainly falls in the unoccupied part of the
band structure. Probing a more highly electron-doped
surface covered by 0.33 ML of K by laser-based ARPES

lows us to reveal the full low-energy electronic structure
ofthe conﬁned CDW phase with a stronglyreduced band
gap completely shifted below EF[red arrow on Fig. 2f)].
At this stage, we have shown that the K-covered 1 T-
TiSe2surface can host a 2DEG coexisting with a surface-
conﬁned CDW and the experimental and theoretical
tendencies of electron doping to destabilize the CDW.
Nevertheless, at the level of our considered exchange-
correlation functional, the DFT calculations are unable
togenerate,alreadyforthepristineCDWphase, theelec-
tronic bands, the atomic structure and PLD amplitude
in simultaneous agreement with experiments [38]. It has
been shown that only an inclusion of the exact exchange
interaction within hybrid functionals properly captures
the full properties of TiSe 2[39]. Therefore any attempt
to drive some conclusions about the contribution of the
excitonic and structural facets of the CDW state from
our DFT calculations is irrelevant. Instead the unprece-
dentedopportunitytotunethefree-carrierdensitywithin
the 2DEG opens an appealing way for probing the per-
turbations of the electronic and lattice subsystems in re-
duced dimensionality upon Coulomb screening.4

cumulative evaporations (from left to right). The elec-
tron density in the 2DEG, n2DEG, has been obtained
from the Luttinger area of the FS, Fig 3a), and found
to linearly increase with the K coverage (see SM for de-
tails). The order parameter, ∆, of the surface-conﬁned
CDW has been determined by adjusting near- EFdisper-
sions calculated within an eﬀective Hamiltonian model

mental Ti 3 dz2and CDW-hybridized QWS, Fig 3b) (see
SM) [41]. In contrast to the CDW-related states, we ﬁrst
see that the Ti 3 dz2-derived QWS monotonoulsy shifts
towards higher BE with n2DEG[dashed-red bands on
Fig. 3b)]. As previously mentioned, this is because its
BE only depends on the depth of the surface quantum
well and is completely unrelated to the CDW energetics.
This is conﬁrmed by our self-consistent PS calculations
that intentionally omit the CDW-hybridized states and
usedn2DEGas the only varying parameter (see SM for
details on the PS calculations). As seen Fig. 3c), the
obtained eigenenergies, E0
dz2,1, (red-dashed lines), of the
ﬁrst bound QWS (blue areas that show the modulus-
squared of the corresponding eigenfunctions |φ0

almost perfectly match the experimental ones for all con-
sideredn2DEGand related surface band-bending poten-
tialsVS. Let us now discuss the impact of the increasing
n2DEGon the CDW-hybridized QWS. Figure 3d) shows
the evolution of the BEs of the top of the Mexican-
hat [dashed-green bands in Fig. 3b)] and backfolded
hole bands [dashed-orange bands in Fig. 3b)] obtained
from the model with respect to E0
dz2,1as a function of
n2DEG. With increased n2DEG, they symmetrically ap-
proach each other, manifesting the closure of the con-
ﬁned CDW gap towards a surface-conﬁned semimetallic
normal state.
Interestingly, ∆ exhibits a rapid drop as a function of
n2DEG[Fig. 3e)], that follows a mean-ﬁeld like behav-
ior up to a critical electron density nc=0.156±0.024
e−/u.c.. Within the EI scenario of the phase transi-
tion when the shift of the chemical potential, initially
placed at mid-gap between the hole an electron bands,
exceeds half of the excitonic binding energy described
by a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer-likeorder parameter, the
electronbandstartstobeﬁlledandtheEIphasebecomes
unstable [42]. In 1 T-TiSe2, the CDW gap opens on both
sides of the Ti 3 d-Se 4px,yelectron-hole band crossings
and enlarges around the new Ti 3 dz2non-bonding state
which is unaﬀected by the orbital-selective hybridization
allowed by the PLD [34]. Therefore, our experimental
ﬁnding of a critical density at which the shift of the Ti
3dz2-derived QWS exceeds half of ∆(0) and the upper
edge of the conﬁned CDW gap, i.e., the mexican-hat,
goes below EF, strongly suggest that the gap shrinking
of the surface-conﬁned CDW relates to a decrease of an
excitonic binding energy.
Note, however, that for the highest n2DEG, ∆ has
a non-zero value. Indeed, a small hybridization gap is
clearly opened below EFat¯Mand the backfolded hole
band still appears sharp [see the right-hand side panel
of Fig. 3b)]. This indicates that both the CDW am-
plitude and phase ﬂuctuating modes at the surface are
gapped [43], i.e. the persisting surface-conﬁned CDW is
commensurate with long-range phase coherence. Hence,
we argue that the small remaining CDW gap at dopings5
where excitonic interactions cannot be at play originates
solely from a persisting 2 ×2 structural order that could
be maintained by electrostatic interaction with the bulk
which hosts a perfectly locked-in CDW.
At a ﬁrst sight, our critical electron density ncseems
to overshoot the commonly accepted one by a factor of
∼3 [1, 25, 34, 44]. Nevertheless, several other dispersed
ncvalues have been reported in the literature (see for
example Table I in Ref.[25]), depending essentially of
the means of doping and the use of local or spatially-
averaging techniques for probing the CDW [45–48], that
shows a natural tendency towards nanoscale phase sep-
aration in crystals doped in the high-temperature phase
[36]. In our case, the ordered phase of TiSe 2is electron-
doped by ﬁlling the electron band of non-bonding char-
acter that further allows to solely probe the impact of
increased Coulomb screening. This not only does not
give rise to a signiﬁcant energetic penalty compared with
the equivalent ﬁlling of the electron band in the undis-
torted phase [34], but also allows to maintain the CDW
long-range phase coherence. It turns out that our re-
ported critical doping could actually appear as the most
representative one to date. It is also interesting to note
that it is very close to that associated with the emer-
gence of superconductivity in electrically-gated 1 T-TiSe2
nanosheets [24]. This suggests that the superconduct-
ing phase could compete with the excitonic contribution
of the CDW, thus pointing to an unconventional pair-
ing mechanism. Yet, in our case, CDW domain walls
that have been proposed to host superconductivity are
missing [24, 46, 47]. Therefore, the questions about the
nature of the superconducting phase in bulk doped 1 T-
TiSe2, its existence at the 2D limit, and of their possible
unconventional origin remain open.
To conclude, throughthe speciﬁc caseof 1 T-TiSe2, our
study reports coexisting 2DEG and quantum-conﬁned
CDW at a TMD surface and constitutes a prime example
of a carrier-density controlled many-body quantum state
in reduced dimensionality. This approach has allowed
us to completely nullify an excitonic energy gain at the
surface and at thermal equilibrium while maintaining a
2D CDW order with long-range phase coherence that we
thereby propose to be purely electron-phonon coupled.
We believe that our study further provides experimen-
tal avenues for controlling dimensional crossovers within
unexplored parts of the electronic phase diagrams of cor-
related materials.

[30] See Supplemental Material at url for details on the K
coverage characterization, the density functional the-
ory calculations, the experimental charge transfer deter-
mination, the slabs potentials extraction, the compari-
son of He-I and laser-based ARPES intensity maps at
high K coverage, and the used self-consistent Poisson-
Schr¨ odinger parameters, which includes Refs.[49–59].
[31] Here, the K adlayer was obtained by a single evaporation
on a freshly cleaved 1 T-TiSe2surface kept at 40 K in the
ARPES chamber before being quickly transferred in the
STM previously cooled down to 4.6 K. We cannot thus
exclude that the sample experienced a small tempera-
ture cycling during the transfer and that a tiny fraction
of K atoms has intercalated. Also note that the CDW
modulations gets smeared out in STM images taken at
Vbias=−1 V because many electronic states that are
not concerned with the electronic band structure recon-
struction are taken into account.

[41] Within our 4-band model we thus do not consider the
two spin-orbit split Se 4 phole bands that lead to a one
non-bondingstate andapair ofnon-degeneratedbonding
states upon orbitals hybridization allowed by the PLD.
In our case, we obtained one doubly-degenerate bonding
state (the Mexican hat) and one non-bonding Ti 3 dz2
state (red-dashed line), the spectral weight of the blue-
dashed dispersion beingexactlyzero for every kalongthe
¯Γ-¯Mdirection [40]. The two hole-bands of TiSe 2being
well separated in energy with only one cutting EFin the
normal state, we expectthe eﬀect ofthe secondhole band
to be a minor correction to our obtained order parameter
values [43].
