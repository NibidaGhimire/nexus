ERGÜN YALÇIN
Abstract. In [F. Xu, On the cohomology rings of small categories, J. Pur e Appl. Algebra
212 (2008), 2555-2569], a LHS-spectral sequence for target regular extensions of small
categories is constructed. We extend this construction to e xt-groups and construct a similar
spectral sequence for source regular extensions (with righ t module coeﬃcients). As a special
case of these LHS-spectral sequences, we obtain three diﬀer ent versions of Słomińska’s
spectral sequence for the cohomology of regular EI-categor ies. We show that many well-
known spectral sequences related to the homology decomposi tions of ﬁnite groups, centric
linking systems, and the orbit category of fusion systems ca n be obtained as the LHS-
spectral sequence of an extension.

(3) the map πx,y: MorCpx,yq ÑMorDpx,yqinduces a bijection
KpyqzMorCpx,yq –MorDpx,yq.
Ifπ:CÑDis a target regular functor with kernel K:“ tKpxquxPObpCq, then we write
E:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑD
whereKis considered as a category (a disjoint union of group catego ries) andiis the functor
which is identity on objects and such that ix:Kpxq ÑAutCpxqis the inclusion map for
everyxPC. We call such a sequence of functors a target regular extension of categories .
We say that the functor π:CÑDissource regular if the opposite functor πop:CopÑDop
is target regular. The kernel Kis deﬁned in a similar way and the extension E:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑD
is called a source regular extension.
There are many examples of source and target regular extensi ons of categories that appear
naturally. Let Gbe a discrete group and Hbe a collection of subgroups of G(closed
under conjugation). The orbit category ofGover the collection His the category OHpGq
whose objects are subgroups HPH, and whose morphisms HÑKare given by G-maps
G{HÑG{K. We can identify the set of G-mapsG{HÑG{Kwith the set of right cosets
tKg|gPG,gHg´1ďKu. The transporter category is the category THpGqwhose objects
are subgroups HPH, and whose morphisms HÑKare given by NGpH,K q “ tgP
G|gHg´1ďKu. The quotient map NGpH,K q ÑKzNGpH,K qdeﬁnes a target regular
extension of categories

E:tCGpHquHPHiÝ ÑTHpGqπÝ ÑFHpGq (1.2)
induced by the quotient map NGpH,K q ÑNGpH,K q{CGpHq –MorFHpGqpH,K q. There
are also many other examples of target and source regular ext ensions related to fusion orbit
category and linking systems. We introduce them in Sections 9 and 10.
In this paper we construct spectral sequences for target and source regular extensions of
categories similar to Lyndon–Hochschild–Serre spectral s equences for group extensions. The
cohomology version of a LHS-spectral sequence for target re gular extensions was constructed
by Xu [44] (see also Oliver and Ventura [34, Prop A.11]). One c an also ﬁnd a construction
of LHS-spectral sequences for homology groups of pre-coﬁbe red functors in Quillen’s lecture
notes in [35, p. 139]. We extend these constructions to ext-g roups and construct a similar
spectral sequence for source regular extensions with right module coeﬃcients.
LetRbe a commutative ring with unity. A contravariant functor M:CopÑR-Mod
is called a rightRC-module . A functor M:CÑR-Mod is called a leftRC-module . Since
we are mostly interested in right RC-modules, and since it is good to ﬁx a choice, when we
sayMis anRC-module we always mean it is a right RC-module. The cohomology of small
category Cwith coeﬃcients in an RC-moduleMis deﬁned by
H˚pC;Mq:“Ext˚

where for each ně0,Extn
RCpR,Mqdenotes the n-th ext-group over the category of RC-
modules and Rdenotes the constant module (see Section 3 for details).
Theorem 1.1 (Xu [44]) .LetE:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑDbe a target regular extension. Then for every
RC-moduleM, there is a spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“HppD;HqpK;Mqq ñHp`qpC;Mq
whereHqpK;Mqdenotes the RD-module that sends xPObpCqto the cohomology group
HqpKpxq;ResixMq.
We review Xu’s construction, provide more details about the module structure of HqpK;Mq,
and show that there is an ext-group version of the LHS-spectr al sequence for extensions of
categories.
Theorem 1.2. LetE:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑDbe a target regular extension. Then for every RD-
moduleNandRC-moduleM, there is a spectral sequence
Ep,q

RDpN,HqpK;Mqq ñExtp`q

whereHqpK;Mqdenotes the RD-module that sends xPObpCqto the cohomology group
HqpKpxq,ResixMq.
Ifπ:CÑDis a source regular functor, then πop:CopÑDopis a target regular functor.
So the spectral sequence above gives a spectral sequence for source regular extensions with
coeﬃcients in left RC-moduleMand a leftRD-moduleN(see Corollary 7.13). However if
π:CÑDis source regular functor and if we want to relate the cohomol ogy ofCandDwith
right module coeﬃcients, then the spectral sequence above c an not be used. For this case,
we construct the following spectral sequence involving the homology groups of the groups in
the kernel K“ tKpxqu.
Theorem 1.3. LetE:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑDbe a source regular extension. For every RC-module
NandRD-moduleM, there is a spectral sequence
Ep,q

RCpN,ResπMq
whereHqpK;Nqdenotes the (right) RD-module that sends xPObpCqto the homology group
HqpKpxq;ResixNq.
We prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 by studying the derived functor s of induction and coin-
duction functors. Associated to a functor F:CÑD, there is a restriction functor
ResF:RD-Mod ÑRC-Mod
deﬁned by precomposition with F. The induction functor and coinduction functors
IndF,CoindF:RC-Mod ÑRD-Mod
in the other direction are deﬁned as the left and right adjoin ts of the restriction functor.
The derived functors of induction and coinduction functors can be calculated by using the
cohomology and homology of certain comma categories (see Pr opositions 5.2 and 5.9). Using
these calculations, we obtain two versions of the Gabriel-Z isman spectral sequence (see The-
orems 5.4 and 5.10). These spectral sequences, with some mod iﬁcation, gives the spectral
sequences in Theorems 1.2 and 1.3.4 ERGÜN YALÇIN
In Section 8 we apply these results to regular EI-categories . A small category Cis called an
EI-category if every endomorphism in Cis an isomorphism. The set of isomorphism classes
rCsof an EI-category Cis a poset with the order relation given by rxs ď rysifMorCpx,yqis
nonempty. Consider the functor CÑ rCsthat sends each xPObpCqto its isomorphism class
rxs. We say that the EI-category Cis target (resp. source) regular if the functor CÑ rCsis
target (resp. source) regular. This gives three diﬀerent ve rsions of LHS-spectral sequences
for regular EI-categories (see Theorem 8.3).
The subdivision category SpCqof an EI-category Cis the category whose objects are the
chains of composable morphisms in C:
σ:“ pσ0α1Ý Ñσ1α2Ý Ñ ¨ ¨ ¨ Ý Ñσn´1αnÝ Ý Ñσnq
where each αiis a non-isomorphism. The morphisms in SpCqare deﬁned by inclusion of
subchains via a sequence of isomorphisms (see Deﬁnition 8.5 ). The subdivision category
SpCqis a source regular category, hence its opposite category spCqis target regular. For
everyRC-moduleM, there is an isomorphism
H˚pspCq;ResIniMq –H˚pC;Mq
whereIni :spCq ÑCis the functor that sends a chain σPspCqto the ﬁrst object σ0PCin
the chain (see Propositions 8.7 and 8.8).
For eachi, letπi: AutspCqpσq ÑAutCpσiqdenote the group homomorphism deﬁned by
restricting an automorphism of σPspCqto the automorphism of the i-th object in the
chain. Applying the spectral sequence in Theorem 8.3 to the c ategoryspCq, and using the
isomorphism above, we obtain the following spectral sequen ce.
Theorem 1.4 (Słomińska [39]) .LetCbe an EI-category and Mbe anRC-module. Then, for
eachqě0, the assignment rσs ÑHqpAutspCqpσq;Resπ0Mpσ0qqdeﬁnes anRrspCqs-module,
denoted by Aq, and there is a spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“HpprspCqs;Aqq ñHp`qpC;Mq.
This spectral sequence is a reformulation of a spectral sequ ence due to Słomińska [39, Cor
1.13]. The trivial coeﬃcient version of this spectral seque nce was constructed by Linckelmann
[30, Thm 3.1] and used for studying the gluing problem in bloc k theory.
In Section 9, we apply the spectral sequences above to the ext ensions involving the trans-
porter category THpGq. The LHS-spectral sequences for the extensions in 1.1 and 1. 2 give
spectral sequences that can be considered as the subgroup an d centralizer decompositions
for the transporter category (see Propositions 9.2 and 9.4) . Applying the spectral sequence
in Theorem 1.4 to the transporter category THpGqgives a spectral sequence that can be
considered as the normalizer decomposition for the transpo rter category (see Proposition
9.5). When we take the coeﬃcients to be the constant functor FpandHto be an ample
collection, these spectral sequences for the transporter c ategory give spectral sequences for
mod-phomology decompositions of the classifying space BG.
In Section 10, we consider p-local ﬁnite groups pS,F,Lqand obtain spectral sequences
for the mod- phomology decompositions of the centric linking system L(with nontrivial
coeﬃcients). In particular we show that there is a target reg ular extension of categories
E:tPuPPFcjÝ ÑLrπÝ ÑOcpFqLHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 5
which gives a spectral sequence that converges to the cohomo logy ofLwith nontrivial coef-
ﬁcients in the following form:
Theorem 1.5. LetpS,F,Lqbe ap-local ﬁnite group. For every RL-moduleM, there is a
spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“HppOcpFq;Hq
Mq ñHp`qpL;Mq
whereHq
Mis theROcpFq-module such that for every PPFc,Hq
MpPq “HqpP;ResjPMpPqq.
This is proved as Proposition 10.6 in the paper. If we apply Th eorem 1.4 to the linking
systemLand to the orbit category OpFcq, we obtain two spectral sequences. These spectral
sequences use the cohomology of the category sdpFcqwhich is the category of F-conjugacy
classes of chains in Fc(see Deﬁnition 10.8).
Theorem 1.6. LetpS,F,Lqbe ap-local ﬁnite group. For every RL-moduleM, there is a
spectral sequence
Ep.q
2“HppsdpFcq;Aq

whereAq
Lis theRsdpFcq-module such that Aq
Lprσsq “HqpAutLpσq;Resπ0MpP0qqfor every
rσs “ rP0ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ăPnsinsdpFcq.
This spectral sequence can also be constructed as the Bousﬁel d-Kan spectral sequence for
the normalizer decomposition for |L|introduced by Libman [28]. Finally we apply Theorem
1.4 to the fusion orbit category OpFcqand obtain a spectral sequence of the following form:
Theorem 1.7. LetpS,F,Lqbe ap-local ﬁnite group. Then for every right ROpFcq-module
M, there is a spectral sequence
Ep.q
2“HppsdpFcq;Aq
Oq ñHp`qpOpFcq;Mq
whereAq
Ois the leftRsdpFcq-module such that Aq
Oprσsq “HqpAutspOpFcqqpσq;Resπ0MpP0qq.
This spectral sequence has some formal similarity to the spe ctral sequence constructed in
[46, Thm 1.7] for studying the sharpness problem. However, t heE2-terms of the spectral
sequence obtained here is in general diﬀerent than the one co nstructed in [46, Thm 1.7].
Notation: Throughout the paper, when we say His a collection, we always assume that H
is closed under conjugation. Ralways denotes an associative commutative ring with unity.
We sayRis ap-local ring if all the primes other than pare invertible in R. When we say Mis
anRC-module without further speciﬁcations, we always mean that Mis a rightRC-module.
We denote the cohomology of the category Cwith coeﬃcients in a left RC-moduleMand in
a rightRC-moduleMboth byH˚pC;Mq. This is the notation used by Lück in [31] and we
follow this convention throughout the paper.

2.Modules over small categories
In this preliminary section we introduce necessary deﬁniti ons for doing homological algebra
over small categories. In the second part of the section we in troduce the induction and
coinduction functors associated to a functor F:CÑD. For more details on this material,
we refer the reader to [31], [37], [38], [24], [42], and [17].6 ERGÜN YALÇIN
2.1.RC-modules. LetCbe a small category. We denote the set of objects in CbyObpCq,
and the set of morphisms from xtoybyMorCpx,yqor simply by Cpx,yq. For eachxPObpCq,
the group of automorphisms of xinCis denoted by AutCpxq. If we reverse all the arrows in
C, the category we obtain is called the opposite category of C, denoted by Cop.
Deﬁnition 2.1. LetRbe a commutative ring with unity. A contravariant functor M:
CopÑR-Mod is called a rightRC-module . A covariant functor M:CÑR-Mod is called
aleftRC-module .When we say Mis anRC-module, it will always mean that it is a right
RC-module, unless otherwise stated explicitly.
LetMbe anRC-module. For each object xPObpCq, theR-moduleMpxqcan be consid-
ered as a right RAutCpxq-module where the action of aPAutpxqis given by the R-module
homomorphism Mpaq:Mpxq ÑMpxq. AnRC-module homomorphism f:MÑNis a
natural transformation of functors. The category of RC-modules is an abelian category and
the usual notions of kernel, cokernel, and exact sequence ex ist and they are deﬁned object-
wise (see [41, §1.6]). For example, a short exact sequence of RC-modulesM1ÑM2ÑM3
is exact if for every xPObpCq, the sequence
M1pxq ÑM2pxq ÑM3pxq
is exact. The kernel kerfof a homomorphism f:MÑNis theRC-module such that
for everyxPObpCq, we have pkerfqpxq “kertfpxq:Mpxq ÑNpxqu. In the category
ofRC-modules, there are enough projectives. Projective module s are constructed using
representable functors as follows:
Deﬁnition 2.2. For eachxPObpCq, letRCp?,xqdenote the RC-module that sends every
yPObpCqto the free R-moduleRCpy,xq. For each morphism ϕ:yÑz, the induced map
RCpz,xq ÑRCpy,xqis deﬁned by precomposition with ϕ.
Using the Yoneda lemma, one can prove the following:
Lemma 2.3. For everyxPObpCqand everyRC-moduleM, there is an isomorphism of
R-modules
HomRCpRCp?,xq,Mq –Mpxq.
Consequently, for every xPObpCq, theRC-moduleRCp?,xqis a projective module.
Proof. See [42, Prop 4.4]. /square
Using Lemma 2.3, one can also show that for each RC-moduleM, there is a projective
RC-modulePand surjective map PÑM(see [31, §9.16, §9.19]). This shows that the
category of RC-modules has enough projectives. There are also enough inje ctives in the
category of RC-modules (see [41, p. 43]).
2.2.Restriction and induction functors.
Deﬁnition 2.4. Given a functor F:CÑDbetween two small categories, the restriction
functor
ResF:RD-Mod ÑRC-Mod
is deﬁned by precomposing with F, i.e. for an RD-moduleM,ResFM:“M˝Fop.LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 7
In the other direction there is an induction functor IndF:RC-Mod ÑRD-Mod which is
deﬁned to be the functor that is left adjoint to the restricti on functor ResFp´q. To show
the existence of the left adjoint, one deﬁnes the induction f unctor either by using left Kan
extensions or by using tensor products. We explain both appr oaches.
Deﬁnition 2.5. For everyRC-moduleM, we deﬁne IndFpMqto be the left Kan extension
LKFoppMqof the functor M:CopÑR-Mod via the functor Fop:CopÑDop.
For this deﬁnition to make sense, one needs to show that the le ft Kan extension LKFoppMq
exists for every RC-moduleM. For this we need to recall the explicit description of Kan
extensions using colimits over comma categories.
Deﬁnition 2.6. LetF:CÑDbe a functor between two small categories. For every
dPObpDq, the comma category dzFis the category whose objects are the pairs pc,fqwhere
cPObpCqandfPMorDpd,Fpcqq, and whose morphisms pc,fq Ñ pc1,f1qare given by the
morphisms ϕ:cÑc1inCsuch thatf“f1˝Fpϕq. The comma category F{dis deﬁned in
a similar way with objects pc,fqwherecPObpCqandfPMorDpFpcq,dq.
IfF:CÑDandM:CÑEare functors where Eis a cocomplete category (i.e., where
the colimits exists), then the left Kan extension LKFpMqexists and for every dPObpDq,
LKFpMqpdq –colim
pc,fqPF{dpM˝πCq
whereπC:F{dÑCis the functor that sends pc,fq PObpF{dqtocPObpCq(see [37, Thm
4.1.4], [24, Thm 2.3.3]). Since the category of R-modules is cocomplete (see [38, Prop 8.4.3]),
the left Kan extension LKFoppMqexists for any RC-moduleM. Explicit description of left
Kan extensions gives the following formula for induction fu nctor.
Lemma 2.7. LetF:CÑDbe a functor and Mbe aRC-module. Then for every dPD,
pIndFMqpdq –colim
pc,fqPFop{dpM˝πCq –colim
pc,fqPpdzFqoppM˝πCq
where in the last expression πCis the functor pdzFqopÑCopthat sends the object pc,fqin
dzFtocPObpCq.
Since by deﬁnition the left Kan extension is the left adjoint of the restriction functor (see
[24, Def 2.3.1, Thm 2.3.3]), we have the following:
Proposition 2.8. LetF:CÑDbe a functor. For every RC-moduleMandRD-module
N, there is a natural isomorphism
HomRDpIndFM,N q –HomRCpM,ResFNq.
As a consequence of the adjointness of the induction and rest riction functors, we have:
Corollary 2.9. For every functor F:CÑD, the induction functor IndF:RC-Mod Ñ
RD-Mod takes projectives to projectives.
Proof. Since the restriction functor ResFp´qpreserves exact sequences, its left adjoint, the
induction functor IndFp´q, takes projectives to projectives. /square
Since taking colimits is not an exact functor, the induction functorIndFp´qis not exact
in general. In Section 5.3, we calculate its left derived fun ctors in terms of homology groups
of the comma category dzF.8 ERGÜN YALÇIN
2.3.Tensor products over RC.We recall the deﬁnition of the tensor product of two
modules over RC.
Deﬁnition 2.10 ([31, §9.12]) .LetMbe a rightRC-module and Nbe a leftRC-module.
Thetensor product ofMandNoverRCis theR-module
MbRCN:“´à

{J
whereJis the ideal generated by the elements of the form
Mpϕqpmq bn´mbNpϕqpnq
over allϕPCpx,yq,mPMpyq, andnPNpxq.
The induction functor IndFp´qassociated to a functor F:CÑDis deﬁned using the
tensor product as follows:
Deﬁnition 2.11. For a functor F:CÑD, letRDp??,Fp?qqdenote the functor DopˆCÑ
R-Mod that sends pd,cq PObpDq ˆObpCqto theR-moduleRDpd,Fpcqq. We can consider
RDp??,Fp?qqas anRC-RD-bimodule where the left RC-module structure and the right
RD-module structure are deﬁned by restricting RDp??,Fp?qqto the corresponding module
categories. For every RC-moduleM, theRD-module IndFMis deﬁned by
IndFM:“MbRCRDp??,Fp?qq.
The deﬁnition of tensor product in Deﬁnition 2.10 gives the f ollowing explicit description
forpIndFMqpdqfor everydPObpDq:
pIndFMqpdq “´à

{J
whereJis the ideal generated by the elements of the form Mpϕqpmq bf´mb pFpϕq ˝fq
over allϕPCpc,c1q,mPMpc1q, andfPDpd,Fpcqq.
Example 2.12. LetGbe a group and Hbe a subgroup of G. IfF:HÑGis the functor
between two group categories induced the inclusion map, the n the induction functor IndFp´q
coincides with the usual induction IndG
Hp´qdeﬁned by IndG
HM“MbRHRG.
The induction functor IndFp´qdeﬁned using tensor products is left adjoint to the restric-
tion functor (see [31, §9.22]). By the uniqueness of the left a djoints up to unique isomorphism
(see [38, Cor 16.4.4]), we can conclude that the two deﬁnitio ns of induction using Kan ex-
tensions and using tensor products coincide. One can see thi s also by observing that the
formula for IndpMqpdqin both deﬁnitions give the same module.
We end this section with a well-known lemma on tensor product of modules over categories.
We will use this lemma in our proofs in the paper.
Lemma 2.13. LetMbe a leftRC-module and Nbe a rightRC-module. Then for every
zPObpCq, there are natural isomorphism of R-modules:
(i)RCp?,zq bRCM–Mpzq.
(ii)NbRCRCpz,?q –Npzq.LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 9
Proof. We prove the ﬁrst one, the argument for the second one is simil ar. By the deﬁnition
of tensor product over RC, for everyzPObpCq, we have
RCp?,zq bRCM“´à
xPObpCqRCpx,zq bRMpxq¯

mPMpxq, is equal to ridzbMpτqpmqs, and two elements ridzbmsand ridzbm1swith
m,m1PMpzqbeing equal only if m“m1. Hence,RCp?,zq bRCM–Mpzq. The naturality
is clear from this argument. /square
A proof of Lemma 2.13 can also be given using category algebra s sinceRCp?,zq “1z¨RC
andRCpz,?q “RC¨1z(see [42] for details).
2.4.Coinduction functor. LetF:CÑDbe a functor between two small categories.
Associated to F, there is a coinduction functor
CoindF:RC-Mod ÑRD-Mod
deﬁned as the functor which is right adjoint to the restricti on functor. As in the case of the
induction functor, the coinduction functor can be deﬁned by using the limit description of
Kan extensions. There is also a deﬁnition of it using hom-fun ctor and bimodules.
Deﬁnition 2.14 ([31, §9.15]) .LetRDpFp?q,??qdenote the functor
CopˆDÑR-Mod
that sends a pair pc,dq PObpCq ˆObpDqto theR-moduleRDpFpcq,dq. Note that for each
dPObpDq,RDpFp?q,dqis a rightRC-module, and for each cPObpCq,RDpFpcq,??qis a
leftRD-module. Because of this two sided module structure, we say RDpFp?q,??qis an
RD-RC-bimodule.
The coinduction functor is deﬁned as follows:
Deﬁnition 2.15. LetF:CÑDbe a functor between two small categories. For an RC-
moduleM,CoindFMis deﬁned to be the RD-module such that
pCoindFMqp??q “HomRCpRDpFp?q,??q,Mq.
We have the following adjointness property:
Proposition 2.16 ([31, §9.22]) .For everyRD-moduleNand everyRC-moduleM, there is
a natural isomorphism
HomRDpN,CoindFMq –HomRCpResFN,M q.
Moreover, the coinduction functor CoindF:RC-Mod ÑRD-Mod takes injectives to injec-
tives.
Proof. The ﬁrst sentence follows from the adjointness of the tensor product and the Hom
functor (see [37, Thm 15.1.3]), The second sentence follows from the adjointness property
and from the fact that the restriction functor is exact. /square10 ERGÜN YALÇIN
As in the case of the induction functor, the coinduction func tor can be deﬁned using Kan
extensions. The right Kan extension RKFpMqof the functor M:CÑEalong a functor
F:CÑDis deﬁned to be the right adjoint of the restriction functor ResFp´q. The right
Kan extension RKFpMqexists if the category Eis complete (if limits in Eexist) and we
have
RKFpMqpdq –lim
pc,fqPdzFpM˝πCq
whereπC:dzFÑCis the functor that sends pc,f:dÑFpcqqtocinObpCq(see [24, Def
2.3.1, Thm 2.3.3]).
Since the category of R-modules is complete, the right Kan extension RKFoppMqexists
for every functor F:CÑDandRC-moduleM. By the uniqueness of right adjoints, these
two deﬁnitions coincide. We have the following formula for t he coinduction functor.
Lemma 2.17. LetF:CÑDbe a functor and Mbe anRD-module. Then, for every
dPObpDq,
pCoindFMqpdq –lim
pc,fqPdzFoppM˝πCq –lim
pc,fqPpF{dqoppM˝πCq
whereπC:pF{dqopÑCopin the last expression is the functor that sends pc,fq PObpF{dqto
cPObpCq.
3.Cohomology of small categories
In this section we introduce the basic deﬁnitions for cohomo logy of small categories. The
deﬁnition of cohomology of a small category with coeﬃcients in a natural system was in-
troduced by Baues and Wirsching in [3]. The deﬁnition of cohom ology of small categories
with coeﬃcients in right and left RC-modules was introduced earlier (see, for example, [36]).

3.1.Ext-groups and cohomology of a small category. LetNbe anRC-module. The
assignment MÑHomRCpN,M qdeﬁnes a covariant functor HomRCpN,´qfrom the abelian
category of RC-modules to R-modules. This functor is left exact. For each ně0, we denote
itsn-th right derived functor by RnHomRCpN,´q.
Deﬁnition 3.1. LetM,N beRC-modules. For every ně0, theext-group of NandMis
deﬁned by
Extn
RCpN,M q:“ rRnHomRCpN,´qspMq.
By the balancing theorem [41, Thm 2.7.6], the ext-group Extn
RCpN,M qcan also be cal-
culated as the n-th cohomology of the cochain complex HomRCpP˚,MqwhereP˚is an
RC-projective resolution of N.
Deﬁnition 3.2. LetCbe a small category. The constant functor RoverCis theRC-
module that sends every object xPObpCqtoR, and every morphism to the identity map
idR:RÑR. For every RC-moduleM, forně0, then-th cohomology group of Cwith
coeﬃcients in Mis deﬁned by
HnpC;Mq:“Extn
RCpR,Mq.LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 11
The cohomology group HnpC;Mqcan also be viewed as the n-th derived functor of the
limit functor over C. The category of RC-modules is complete and the limit of an RC-module
MoverCis deﬁned as follows:
lim
CM:“ tpmxq Pź
xPCMpxq |Mpαqpmyq “mxfor everyα:xÑyinCu.
The limit functor limCp´qis a left exact functor and the n-th right derived functor of limCp´q
is called the n-th higher limit of M, and it is denoted by limn
CM. From the deﬁnitions it
follows that:
Proposition 3.3. For everyRC-moduleM, there is an isomorphism
HomRCpR,Mq –lim
CM.
Hence for every ně0, there is an isomorphism limn
CM–HnpC;Mq.
IfCis equal to the group category Gfor a group G, then anRG-moduleMis a module
over the group ring RG, and the cohomology of Cwith coeﬃcients in Mcoincides with the
cohomology of the group Gwith coeﬃcients in the RG-moduleM(see [7] for the deﬁnition
of cohomology of a group).
3.2.Homology of a small category. Homology of a category is deﬁned using tor-groups
TorRC
˚pM,N q. The tor-groups over a category is called the functor homolo gy and it is a well
studied area. We refer the reader to [37, Chp 15], [40], [10], [19] for more details on this
material.
Deﬁnition 3.4. LetMbe a leftRC-module. The functor ´ bRCM:NÑNbRCMwhich
sends a right RC-moduleNto theR-moduleNbRCMis right exact. For a right RC-module
Nand for every ně0, then-th tor-group is deﬁned by
TorRC
npN,M q:“Lnp´ bRCMqpNq
whereLnp´ bRCMqis then-th left derived functor of the functor ´ bRCM.
By the deﬁnition of left derived functors, tor-groups can be c alculated as follows: Let N
be a rightRC-module and P˚ÑNbe a rightRC-projective resolution of N. Then for every
leftRC-moduleM, the tor-group TorRC
npN,M qis then-th homology group of the chain
complexP˚bRCM. Tor-groups can also be computed using a double complex.
Theorem 3.5 (Weibel, [41, Thm 2.7.2]) .LetNbe a rightRC-module and Mbe a left
RC-module. Then

3.3.Classifying space of a category. For a small category C, the nerve NCis the sim-
plicial set whose n-simplices are given by an n-fold sequence of composable morphisms
σ:“ px0α1Ý Ñx1α2Ý Ñx2α3Ý Ñ ¨ ¨ ¨αnÝ Ñxnq
and the face maps di:pNCqnÑ pNCqn´1are deﬁned by deleting the i-th object in the chain
and the degeneracy maps si:pNCqnÑ pNCqn`1are deﬁned by adding the identity map
idxi:xiÑxito the chain (see [1, Section III.2.2] for details).
The classifying space BCofCis deﬁned to be the geometric realization of the nerve
NC. The topological space BCis a CW-complex, and for any abelian group A, we denote
its cellular (and singular) cohomology by H˚pBC;Aq. The cohomology group H˚pBC;Aq
is isomorphic to the cohomology of Cwith coeﬃcients in the constant functor A(see [37,
16.2.3]).
IfF:CÑDis a functor, then it deﬁnes a simplicial map between corresp onding nerves
and it gives a continuous map BF:BCÑBDbetween the classifying spaces. We have the
following:
Proposition 3.7. LetF,F1:CÑDbe two functors. If there is a natural transformation
µ:FÑF1, then the induced maps BF,BF1:BCÑBDare homotopic.
Proof. See [1, Prop III.2.1]. /square
As a consequence, we obtain that if CandDare equivalent categories then BCandBD
are homotopy equivalent, hence H˚pBC;Aq –H˚pBD;Aqfor every abelian group A. In
particular, if the category Chas an initial object, then BCis contractible and H˚pBC;Aq –
H˚ppt;Aq.
4.Functoriality and Shapiro’s lemma
4.1.Functoriality of the cohomology of a category. A special case of the cohomology
of a small category is the cohomology of a group. In that case, for every group homomorphism
f:GÑH, there is an induced homomorphism f˚:H˚pH;Mq ÑH˚pG;ResfMq. For the
cohomology of small categories, there is a similar induced h omomorphism.
Proposition 4.1. LetF:CÑDbe a functor between two small categories. Then for every
RD-moduleM, the functor Finduces a graded R-module homomorphism
F˚:H˚pD;Mq ÑH˚pC;ResFMq.
Proof. This is well-known, but for completeness we add a proof here. LetRCandRDdenote
the constant functors for the categories CandD, respectively. There is an isomorphism
j:RCÑResFRDsuch that for each xPObpCq,jpxq:RCpxq ÑRDpFpxqqis the identity
mapidR:RÑR. Letµ: IndFRCÑRDtheRD-module homomorphism associated to the
mapjunder the isomorphism in Proposition 2.8.
LetP˚be anRC-projective resolution of RC, andQ˚be anRD-projective resolution
ofRD. Consider the chain complex IndFP˚ÑIndFRCobtained by applying the functor
IndFp´qto the complex P˚ÑR. By Corollary 2.9, IndFP˚is a chain complex of projective
RD-modules. Hence there is a chain map µ˚: IndFP˚ÑQ˚covering the homomorphism
µ: IndFRCÑRD. For every RD-moduleM, this induces a homomorphism
H˚pD;Mq –H˚pHomRDpQ˚,Mqqµ˚
Ý Ý ÑH˚pHomRDpIndFP˚,Mqq.LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 13
By Deﬁnition 3.2 and Proposition 2.8, we have
H˚pHomRDpIndFP˚,Mqq –H˚pHomRCpP˚,ResFMqq –H˚pC;ResFMq.
Combining these, we obtain the homomorphism F˚:H˚pD;Mq ÑH˚pC;ResFMq./square
More generally, in [43] a notion of biset functor for categor ies is deﬁned and it is shown
that for a ﬁeld R,H˚pC;Rqis a biset functor on Ball,1
R(see [43, Thm 6.7]).
4.2.Functoriality of the homology of a category. For a functor F:CÑD, the
induction functor for a left RC-module is deﬁned in a similar way to the deﬁnition of the
induction functor for a right RC-module. Let RDpFp?q,??qdenote the RD-RC-bimodule
deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.14. For a left RC-moduleM, we have
IndFM:“RDpFp?q,??q bRCM.
We have the following well-known fact for the induction func tor.
Lemma 4.2. LetF:CÑDbe a functor. Then for every right RD-moduleNandRC-
moduleM, there is an isomorphism of R-modules
NbRDpIndFMq – pResFNq bRCM.
Proof. This follows easily from deﬁnitions and from Lemma 2.13. /square
We now show that homology of a category is functorial.
Proposition 4.3 ([40, Cor 3.11]) .LetF:CÑDbe a functor. For every RD-moduleN,
there is a graded R-module homomorphism
F˚:H˚pC;ResFNq ÑH˚pD;Nq.
Proof. Letµ: IndFRCÑRDdenote theRD-module homomorphism between corresponding
constant functors (as left modules). Let P˚be a leftRC-projective resolution of RC, andQ˚
be a leftRD-projective resolution of RD. There is a chain map µ˚: IndFP˚ÑQ˚covering
µ. By Deﬁnition 3.6 and Lemma 4.2 , we have
H˚pC;ResFNq –H˚pResFNbRCP˚q –H˚pNbRDIndFP˚q.
The chain map µ˚induces a graded R-module homomorphism
H˚pNbRDIndFP˚qµ˚Ý Ý ÑH˚pNbRDQ˚q –H˚pD;Nq.
Combining these, we obtain the homomorphism F˚:H˚pC;ResFNq ÑH˚pD;Nq./square
4.3.Shapiro’s isomorphism. LetHbe a subgroup of a group G, andF:HÑGbe the
functor deﬁned by the inclusion map HÑG. Then we have IndFM–MbRHRG. In
this case IndG
Hp´qis an exact functor since RGis free as an RH-module. There are other
examples of functors F:CÑDwhere the associated induction functor IndFp´qis exact. An
interesting example of a such functor is the inclusion funct or between two orbit categories
OHpHq ÑOHpGqwhereHis a subgroup of G(see [17, Lem 2.9]). A similar exactness
result is proved in [46, Prop 4.5] for functors FHpHq ÑFHpGqbetween two fusion orbit
categories.
When the induction functor is exact, then there is an isomorp hism of ext-groups, called
Shapiro’s isomorphism :14 ERGÜN YALÇIN
Proposition 4.4. LetF:CÑDbe a functor between two small categories. Assume that
the induction functor IndF:RC-Mod ÑRD-Mod is exact. Then for every RC-moduleN
andRD-moduleM, there is an isomorphism
Ext˚
RDpIndFN,M q –Ext˚
RCpN,ResFMq.
Proof. This follows easily from the adjointness of induction and re striction functors. /square
One special case where the induction functor IndFp´qis exact is the case where Fhas a
right adjoint. We explain this case in detail in Section 6.2.
There is also a version of Shapiro’s lemma for coinduction fu nctor:
Proposition 4.5. LetF:CÑDbe a functor between two small categories. Assume that the
coinduction functor CoindFp´qis exact. Then for every RD-moduleNand everyRC-module
M, there is a natural isomorphism
Ext˚
RDpN,CoindFMq –Ext˚
RCpResFN,M q.
Proof. This follows from the adjointness of coinduction and restri ction functors. /square
If we takeN“Rin Proposition 4.5, we obtain Shapiro’s isomorphism for the cohomology
of categories.
Corollary 4.6 ([21, Lem 3.1], [27, Lem 3.5]) .LetF:CÑDbe a functor between two small
categories. Assume that the coinduction functor CoindF:RC-Mod ÑRD-Mod is exact.
Then for every RC-moduleM, there is an isomorphism
H˚pD;CoindFMq –H˚pC;Mq.
5.Gabriel-Zisman Spectral Sequence
In this section, we ﬁrst review the construction of the Gabri el-Zisman spectral sequence for
cohomology of categories (see [12, Appendix II, Thm 3.6]). T hen we construct a version of
the Gabriel-Zisman spectral sequence involving the derive d functors of the induction functor.
5.1.Derived functors of the coinduction functor. LetF:CÑDbe a functor and
Mbe anRC-module. For each dPObpDq, letF{ddenote the comma category and πC:
pF{dqopÑCopis the functor that sends pc,fq PF{dtocPObpCq. For each ně0, let
HnpF{d;M˝πCqdenote the n-th cohomology of the comma category F{dwith coeﬃcients
in the (right) RpF{dq-moduleM˝πC. By Proposition 4.1, for every morphism ϕ:dÑd1in
D, there is an induced R-module homomorphism
pF{ϕq˚:HnpF{d1;M˝πd1
Cq ÑHnpF{d;M˝πd
Cq.
Lemma 5.1. The assignment dÑHnpF{d;M˝πCq, together with the induced homomor-
phisms pF{ϕq˚for everyϕ:dÑd1deﬁnes anRD-module. We denote this RD-module by
HnpF{´;M˝πCq.
Proof. This is clear from the deﬁnitions. /square
We have the following:LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 15
Proposition 5.2. LetF:CÑDbe a functor and Mbe anRC-module. Then the coin-
duction functor CoindFp´qis left exact and its n-th right derived functor calculated at M,
pRnCoindFqpMq, is isomorphic to the RD-moduleHnpF{´;M˝πCq.
Proof. By Lemma 2.17, for every dPObpDq,
pCoindFMqpdq –lim
pc,fqPpF{dqoppM˝πCq.
This gives that
pRnCoindFqpMqpdq –limn
pF{dqoppM˝πCq –HnpF{d;M˝πCq
for everydPObpDq. Since these isomorphisms are natural, this gives the desir ed result. /square
5.2.Gabriel-Zisman spectral sequence. We ﬁrst recall the Grothendieck spectral se-
quence deﬁned for a composition of functors.
Theorem 5.3 ([41, Thm 5.8.3]) .LetA,B, andCbe abelian categories such that both Aand
Bhave enough injectives. Suppose that G:AÑBandF:BÑCare left exact functors
such thatGsends injective objects of AtoF-acyclic objects of B(BPObpBqisF-acyclic
ifRiFpBq “0fori‰0). Then for every APA, there exists a convergent ﬁrst quadrant
cohomology spectral sequence:
Ep,q
2“ pRpFq`
pRqGqpAq˘
ñRp`qpF˝GqpAq.
Applying the Grothendieck Spectral sequence to the composi tion of the coinduction func-
tor and the hom-functor, we obtain a spectral sequence which is an ext-group version of
Gabriel-Zisman spectral sequence [12, Appendix II, Thm 3.6 ].
Theorem 5.4. LetF:CÑDbe a functor between two small categories. Let Nbe an
RD-module and Mbe anRC-module. Then there is a ﬁrst quadrant cohomology spectral
sequence

deﬁned byMÑCoindFM, and
HomRDpN,´q:RD-Mod ÑR-Mod
deﬁned by LÑHomRDpN,L q. By Proposition 2.16, the composition of these functors
is isomorphic to the functor HomRCpResFN,´q. It is clear that both CoindFp´qand
HomRDpN,´qare left exact functors. By Proposition 2.16, CoindFp´qtakes injective RC-
modules to injective RD-modules. Hence we can apply Theorem 5.3 to obtain a spectral
sequence
Ep,q
2“Extp

RCpResFN,M q.
By Proposition 5.2, the n-th right derived functors of CoindFp´qare isomorphic to the
cohomology groups HnpF{´;M˝πCq. This completes the proof. /square
TakingM“R, we obtain the following spectral sequence for the cohomolo gy of categories.16 ERGÜN YALÇIN
Corollary 5.5. For everyRC-moduleM, there is a spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“HppD;HqpF{´;M˝πCqq ñHp`qpC;Mq.
This spectral sequence is usually called the cohomology ver sion of the Gabriel-Zisman
spectral sequence. The homology version is stated in [12, Ap pendix II, Thm 3.6]. See also
[13] for the Baues-Wirsching cohomology version of the Gabri el-Zisman spectral sequence.
5.3.Derived functors of the induction functor. The homology groups of a small cat-
egoryCcan be interpreted as the derived functors of the colimit fun ctor over C. To explain
this, we ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of the colimit over a categ ory.
Deﬁnition 5.6. LetManRC-module. The colimit of Mis theR-module
colim
CM“´à
xPCMpxq¯
{J
whereJ“ xMpϕqpmxq ´mx|mxPMpxq, ϕPCpy,xqy.
It is easy to see that for every RC-moduleM, we have colimCM–MbRCR. This
shows that the colimit functor colimC:RC-Mod ÑRD-Mod is right exact. The left derived
functors of the colimit functor are called the higher colimits over the category C, denoted by
colimC
np´qforně0. The following is an easy consequence of the deﬁnitions abov e.
Lemma 5.7. For a leftRC-moduleM, and for every ně0, we haveHnpC;Mq –colimC
npMq.
LetF:CÑDbe a functor and Nbe anRC-module. By Lemma 2.7, for every dPObpDq,
pIndFNqpdq –colim
pc,fqPpdzFqoppN˝πCq. (5.1)
Since taking colimits is a right exact functor, this isomorp hism gives that the induction
functorIndFp´qis right exact, and the left derived functors of IndFp´qare the higher
colimits over the category pdzFqop. We conclude the following:
Lemma 5.8. LetF:CÑDbe a functor. For every RC-moduleN, and every dPObpDq,
there is an isomorphism
LnpIndFqpNqpdq –HnpdzF;N˝πCq
whereN˝πCis the right RpdzFq-module deﬁned by the composition N˝πC:pdzFqopÑ
CopÑR-Mod.
Proof. This follows from the isomorphism in (5.1) and from Lemma 5.7 . /square
Every morphism ϕ:dÑd1inDdeﬁnes a functor ϕzF:d1zFÑdzF. By Proposition
4.3, this functor induces a graded R-module homomorphism
pϕzFq˚:H˚pd1zF;N˝πd1
Cq ÑH˚pdzF;N˝πd
Cq.
Together with these induced homomorphisms, the assignment dÑHnpdzF;N˝πCqdeﬁnes a
rightRD-module. We denote this RD-module with Hnp´zF;N˝πCq. Since the isomorphism
in 5.1 is natural in d, the isomorphism in Lemma 5.8 is natural in d. Hence we can conclude
the following:LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 17
Proposition 5.9. LetF:CÑDbe a functor and Nbe anRC-module. Then for each
ně0, there is an isomorphism of RD-modules
LnpIndFp´qqpNq –Hnp´zF;N˝πCq
whereHnp´zF;N˝πCqdenotesRD-module deﬁned above.
5.4.A version of the Gabriel-Zisman spectral sequence. As a consequence of the
results in this section, we obtain the following spectral se quence:
Theorem 5.10. LetF:CÑDbe a functor, and let Nbe a rightRC-module and Mbe a

of functors
pIndFp´qqop:pRC-Mod qopÑ pRD-Mod qop
and
HomRDp´;Mq:pRD-Mod qopÑR-Mod.
Both of these functors are left exact and the functor pIndFp´qqoptakes injectives to injec-
tives, because IndFp´qtakes projectives to projectives. Applying Theorem 5.3, we obtain a
spectral sequence

6.Isomorphism theorems for the cohomology of categories
In this section we review some of the isomorphism theorems fo r the cohomology of small
categories that we will be using in the rest of the paper.
6.1.The Jackowski-Słomińska theorem. One of the important isomorphism theorems
for cohomology of small categories is the Jackowski-Słomiń ska coﬁnality theorem. We give
a proof for this theorem as a consequence of the spectral sequ ence in Theorem 5.10.
Deﬁnition 6.1. LetRbe a commutative ring with unity. A small category Cis called
R-acyclic ifH˚pBC;Rq –H˚ppt;Rq. A functor F:CÑDbetween two small categories is
right coﬁnal over Rif for every dPObpDq, the comma category dzFisR-acyclic.
Theorem 6.2 (Jackowski-Słomińska [23]) .LetF:CÑDbe a functor between two small
categories. If Fis right coﬁnal over R, then for every RD-moduleM, the homomorphism
F˚:H˚pD;Mq–Ý ÑH˚pC;ResFMq
induced by the functor F, is an isomorphism.18 ERGÜN YALÇIN
Proof. IfF:CÑDis right coﬁnal over R, then forqě0,
Hqp´zF;R˝πCq –HqpBp´zFq;Rq –#

If we take N“Rin the spectral sequence in Theorem 5.10, then for every RD-module
M, this spectral sequence collapses at the E2-page to the horizontal line at q“0. This
gives that the edge homomorphism E˚,0
2ÑH˚pC;ResFMqis an isomorphism. We have
E˚,0
2–Ext˚
RDpR,Mq –H˚pD;Mq. It is is easy to show that the edge homomorphism for
this spectral sequence coincides with the map F˚under this identiﬁcation. /square
6.2.Isomorphisms induced by adjoint pairs.
Deﬁnition 6.3 ([38, Def 16.4.1]) .LetF:CÑDandG:DÑCbe functors. The pair
pF,G qis called a pair of adjoint functors if there is an isomorphism
DpFp?q,??q–Ý ÑCp?,Gp??qq
of bifunctors CopˆDÑEns where Ens is the category of sets in a ﬁxed universe.
In the above deﬁnition, the RD-RC-bimoduleRDpFp?q,??qis the functor CopˆDÑ
R-Mod that sends pc,dq PObpCq ˆObpDqto theR-moduleRDpFpcq,dq, and theRD-RC-
bimoduleRCp?,Gp??qqis the functor CopˆDÑR-Mod that sends pc,dq PObpCq ˆObpDq
to theR-moduleRCpc,Gpdqq. The following is well-known (see [24, Exercise 2.10]).
Proposition 6.4. LetpF,G qbe a pair of adjoint functors where F:CÑDandG:DÑC.
Then the following holds:
(1)IndGp´q –ResFp´q. As a consequence, IndGp´qis an exact functor.
(2)CoindFp´q –ResGp´q. As a consequence, CoindFp´qis an exact functor.
Proof. LetpF,G qbe an adjoint pair and Nbe anRD-moduleN. Then by Lemma 2.13 we
have
IndGpNq “NbRDRCp?,Gp??qq –NbRDRDpFp?q,??q –ResFpNq.
For the second statement, observe that for an RC-moduleM, we have
CoindFpMq –HomRCpRDpFp?q,??q,Mq –HomRCpRCp?,Gp??qq,Mq
–MpGp??qq –ResGpMq.
/square
Combining Proposition 6.4 with Shapiro’s lemma in Corollar y 4.6, we obtain the following
change of categories theorem.
Theorem 6.5 ([22, Lem 5.1]) .LetpF,G qbe an adjoint pair where F:CÑDandG:DÑC.
Then for every RC-moduleM, the homomorphism induced by G,
G˚:H˚pC;Mq–Ý ÑH˚pD;ResGMq,
is an isomorphism.LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 19
Proof. By Proposition 6.4, the coinduction functor CoindGp´qis exact, hence by Lemma 4.6
there is an isomorphism
H˚pD;CoindFMq –H˚pC;Mq.
By Proposition 6.4, we can replace CoindFMwithResGM. By considering a double complex
it is easy to show that the induced map is the same as the homomo rphism induced by G./square
Using the isomorphism in Theorem 6.5, in [20], a transfer map is deﬁned for cohomology
of categories with coeﬃcients in pre-Green functors.
In the case where F:CÑDis an embedding onto a full subcategory then the following
is also true.
Lemma 6.6. IfF:CÑDis an embedding onto a full subcategory, then
(1)ResF˝CoindF“idRC.
(2)ResF˝IndF“idRC.
Proof. See [24, Thm 2.3.3]. /square
6.3.Equivalence of Categories. Recall that two categories CandDare called equivalent
if there are functors F:CÑDandG:DÑCsuch thatF˝G–ηidDandG˝F–µidC
whereηandµare natural isomorphisms.
Theorem 6.7 ([3, Thm 1.11]) .LetF:CÑDbe an equivalence of two small categories.
Then for every RD-moduleM, the map induced by Fis an isomorphism
F˚:H˚pD;Mq–Ý ÑH˚pC;ResFMq.
Proof. In this case the functor F:CÑDpossesses a left adjoint L(see [37, Thm 2.5.1]).
Applying Theorem 6.5 to the pair pL,F q, we conclude that F˚is an isomorphism. /square
The category Cisskeletal if any two objects in Cthat are isomorphic are equal. A
subcategory C1ofCis called a skeleton ofCif it is skeletal and if the inclusion functor
i:C1ÑCis an equivalence. Every category Chas a skeleton, and up to isomorphism, the
skeleton of a category is unique (see [38, Propositions 16.3 .4 and 16.3.7]). We denote one of
these choices of skeletons by skpCqand call it the skeleton of the category.
Corollary 6.8. LetCbe a small category, and let i:skpCq ÑCdenote the inclusion of the
skeleton of C. Then for every RC-moduleM, we haveH˚pC;Mq –H˚pskpCq;ResiMq.
This corollary shows that when we are studying the cohomolog y of small categories, we
can replace the category with its skeleton and assume that it is skeletal. We will do this
throughout the paper sometimes without mentioning that we a re replacing the category with
its skeleton.
6.4.First homotopy property. In this section we prove a version of the proposition
proved in [35, §18], called the ﬁrst homotopy property. We st art with some deﬁnitions.
LetF,G:CÑDbe two functors between small categories and η:FñGbe a natural
transformation from FtoG. LetMbe anRD-module. For every morphism ϕ:xÑyin20 ERGÜN YALÇIN
C, there is a commuting diagram:

MpGpϕqq
/d15/d15MpFpyqq
MpFpϕqq
/d15/d15
MpGpxqqM˝ηx/d47/d47MpFpxqq.
This diagram gives that the composition M˝ηinduces an RC-module homomorphism
Resη: ResGMÑResFM.
There is a similar homomorphism deﬁned on the induction func tors described as follows:
The natural transformation η, deﬁnes an RC-RD-bimodule homomorphism
RDp??,Fp?qq ÑRDp??,Gp?qq

morphism
Indη: IndFM–MbRCRDp??,Fp?qq ÑMbRCRDp??,Gp?qq –IndGM.
These two homomorphisms commute with adjunction homomorph isms in the following sense:
Lemma 6.9. LetF,G:CÑDbe two functors and η:FñGbe a natural transformation.
Then for every RC-moduleMandRD-moduleN, the following diagram commutes:

Now we are ready to state the main result of this section.
Proposition 6.10. LetF,G:CÑDbe two functors and η:FñGbe a natural transfor-
mation. Then for every RD-moduleM, the following diagram commutes:

Proof. LetRCandRDdenote the constant functors for CandD, respectively. For each
functorF:CÑD, we have an RC-module homomorphism jF:RCÑResFRDand anRD-
module homomorphism µF: IndFRCÑRD. These homomorphisms are associated to each
other under the isomorphism in Proposition 2.8. Let η:FñGbe a natural transformation,
then we have jF“Resη˝jGandµF“µG˝Indη.
LetP˚be anRC-projective resolution of RC, andQ˚be anRD-projective resolution of RD.
LetpµFq˚: IndFP˚ÑQ˚be a chain map covering the homomorphism µF: IndFRCÑRD,
and pµGq˚: IndGP˚ÑQ˚be a chain map covering the homomorphism µG: IndGRCÑRD.LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 21
SinceµF“µG˝Indη, there is a chain homotopy between pµFq˚and pµGq˚˝Indη. For every
RD-moduleM, the homomorphism F˚is deﬁned by the composition

pΨFq˚–Ý Ý Ý Ý Ý ÑH˚pHomRCpP˚,ResFMqq –H˚pC;ResFMq.
There is a similar description for the induced map G˚using pµGq˚and pΨGq˚. Using the

There is also a homology group version of Proposition 6.10 st ated using the induced
homomorphisms on homology groups introduced in Propositio n 4.3. The proof is similar to
the cohomology version.
7.LHS-spectral sequences for extensions of categories
In group theory, an extension of a group Gwith kernel Kis deﬁned as a sequence of group
homomorphism
1ÑKiÝ Ñ pGπÝ ÑGÑ1
such thatiis injective and πis a surjective with kernel equal to ipKq Ď pG. There is an
equivalence relation on such extensions and the equivalenc e classes of extensions of Gby
Kforms a group, denoted by ExtpG,K q. WhenK“Mis an abelian group, then there
is aZG-module structure on Minduced by the conjugations in pG. Given a group Gand
aZG-moduleM, the equivalence classes of extensions of GbyMis isomorphic to the
cohomology group H2pG,M q. There is a similar extension theory for regular extensions of
small categories.
Deﬁnition 7.1 ([18, Def 1.1], [34, Def A.5]) .LetCandDbe two small categories such
thatObpCq “ObpDq. Letπ:CÑDbe a functor that is the identity map on objects and
surjective on morphism sets. For each xPObpCq, set
Kpxq:“kertπx,x: AutCpxq ÑAutDpxqu.
The groups KpxqandKpyqact on the hom-set Cpx,yqvia composition.
(1) The functor π:CÑDistarget regular if for every x,yPObpCq, the leftKpyq-action
onCpx,yqis free andπx,y:Cpx,yq ÑDpx,yqis the orbit map of this action.
(2) The functor π:CÑDissource regular if for every x,y PObpCq, the right Kpxq-
action on Cpx,yqis free andπx,y:Cpx,yq ÑDpx,yqis the orbit map of this action.
Note that a functor π:CÑDis source regular if the opposite functor πop:CopÑDop
is target regular. We will only introduce the deﬁnitions for target regular extensions and
assume that the analogous deﬁnitions for source regular ext ensions are also introduced.
Ifπ:CÑDis a target regular functor, then the set of subgroups K:“ tKpxquover
xPObpCqcan be considered as a (discrete) category where Kpx,yq “Kpxqwhenx“yand22 ERGÜN YALÇIN
empty otherwise. There is a functor i:KÑCthat sends every kPKpxqto the corresponding
automorphism in AutCpxq. Atarget regular extension of categories is a sequence of functors
E:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑD
whereπis a target regular functor. We call the discrete category Kthekernel of the
extension . WhenKpxqis an abelian group for every xPObpCq, then we say Eis an
extension with abelian kernel. We identify the elements kxPKpxqwith their images under
ixand writekxfor the automorphism ixpkxqinAutCpxq.
Deﬁnition 7.2. Given a target regular extension Eas above, there is an induced action of C
onKdeﬁned as follows: For every morphism ϕ:xÑyinC, and for every kxPKpxq, there
is a unique kyPKpyqsuch thatky˝ϕ“ϕ˝kx. The assignment kxÑkydeﬁnes a group
homomorphism Kpϕq:Kpxq ÑKpyq. We call this the action of ConKinduced by the
extension E. TheC-action on Kdeﬁnes a functor CÑGroups that sends an object xPObpCq
toKpxqand a morphism ϕ:xÑyinCto the group homomorphism Kpϕq:Kpxq ÑKpyq.
For a target regular extension, the action of ConKinduces an action of DonKmodulo the
inner automorphisms of the groups Kpxq, deﬁned as follows: For every morphism ϕ:xÑy
inD, let rϕbe a lifting of ϕinC, and letKprϕq:Kpxq ÑKpyqbe the induced action of rϕon
K. For a diﬀerent choice of lifting rϕ, say rϕ1, we have rϕ1“ky˝rϕfor somekyPKpyq. This
gives thatKprϕ1q “cky˝Kprϕq, henceϕPDpx,yqinduces a well-deﬁned group homomorphism
Kpxq{InnpKpxqq ÑKpyq{InnpKpyqq.
This deﬁnes the D-action on tKpxqumodulo the inner automorphisms. If Eis an extension
with an abelian kernel K“ tMpxqu, then every morphism ϕ:xÑyinDinduces a
well-deﬁned group homomorphism Mpϕq:Mpxq ÑMpyqwhich deﬁnes a left ZD-module
structure on M. For a source regular extension, in a similar way we obtain a r ightRD-module
structure on M.
Deﬁnition 7.3 ([42, p. 20]) .Two target regular extensions E1andE2areequivalent if there
is functorF:C1ÑC2such that the following diagram commutes.

We have the following classiﬁcation theorem for equivalenc e classes of regular extensions.
Theorem 7.4. LetDbe a small category and Mbe a left ZD-module. The equivalence

In the rest of the section we prove the necessary preliminary results to introduce the LHS-
spectral sequence for target and source regular extensions . LetE:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑDbe a target
regular extension. Then for every xPObpDq, there is a functor
Jx:Kpxq Ñπ{x
from the group category Kpxqto the comma category π{x. The functor Jxsends the unique
objectxofKpxqtopx,idxqinObpπ{xq, and sends a group element kPKpxqto the morphism
k:px,idxq Ñ px,idxqinπ{xdeﬁned byk:xÑxinipKpxqq ďAutCpxq. The functor Jxis
deﬁned in [36, p. 9] as part of the discussion on preﬁbred cate gories.
LetMbe a rightRC-module. For every xPObpDq, consider the RKpxq-module
ResJxResπCM
whereπC:π{xÑCis the functor that sends pc,ϕ:cÑxqinπ{xtocPObpCq. Since the
composition πC˝Jxis equal to the inclusion functor ix:Kpxq ÑC, there is an isomorphism
ofRKpxq-modules ResJxResπCM–ResixM. We have the following:
Lemma 7.5. LetE:KÑCπÝ ÑDbe a target regular extension and Mbe anRC-module.
Then for every xPObpCq, the homomorphism
J˚
x:H˚pπ{x;ResπCMq–Ý ÑH˚pKpxq;ResixMq
induced by the functor Jx:Kpxq Ñπ{xis an isomorphism.
Proof. In [44], this is proved by showing that the functor Jxis right coﬁnal (see [44, Lem 4.2]).
Then the result follows from the Jackowski-Słomińska coﬁna lity theorem. Alternatively, one
can show that the functor Jxhas a left adjoint, and then one can apply Theorem 6.5 to
conclude that the induced map J˚
xis an isomorphism.
The left adjoint rx:π{xÑKpxqofJxis deﬁned as follows: Since Kpxqhas a unique
objectxPKpxq,rxsends every object of π{xtox. For each morphism yÑxinD, choose
a lifting rϕ:yÑxinC. Letα:py1,ϕ1:y1Ñxq Ñ py2,ϕ2:y2Ñxqbe a morphism
inπ{xdeﬁned by a morphism α:y1Ñy2inCsatisfyingϕ1“ϕ2˝πpαq. Then there
is a unique kαPKpxqsuch thatkα˝rϕ1“rϕ2˝α. We deﬁne rxpαq:“kα. For every
β:py2,ϕ2:y2Ñxq Ñ py3,ϕ3:y3Ñxq, we have
rϕ3˝ pβ˝αq “ p rϕ3˝βq ˝α“ pkβ˝rϕ2q ˝α“kβ˝ prϕ2˝αq “kβkα˝rϕ1.
By the uniqueness of kβ˝αPKpxq, we havekβ˝α“kβkα. Hencerxdeﬁnes a functor.
It is clear that rx˝Jx“idKpxq. We need to show that there is a natural transformation
η: idπ{xñJx˝rx. We deﬁne
ηpy,ϕ:yÑxq:py,ϕ:yÑxq Ñ px,idx:xÑxq
to be the morphism deﬁned by the morphism rϕ:yÑxinC. It is easy to check that this
deﬁnes a natural transformation. /square
Remark 7.6. Note that for any RC-moduleM, theKpxq-module ResixMcan be thought
as the restriction of the RAutCpxq-moduleMpxqtoKpxqvia the inclusion map Kpxq Ñ
AutCpxq. When we think of ResixMin this way we write it as Mpxq|Kpxq. We sometimes
just writeMpxqfor thisKpxq-module when it is clear from the context that we mean the
Kpxq-module.24 ERGÜN YALÇIN
We will now show that the isomorphism in Lemma 7.5 is actually an isomorphism of right
RD-modules with suitably deﬁned RD-module structures on both sides of the isomorphism.
On the left side of the isomorphism we will use the RD-moduleH˚pπ{´;ResπCMqintroduced
in Lemma 5.1.
For the right hand side we deﬁne the RC-module structure as follows: Let ϕ:xÑz
be a morphism in D, and let rϕ:xÑybe a lifting of ϕinC. LetKprϕq:Kpxq ÑKpyq
denote the group homomorphism induced by the C-action on K. Note that the R-module
homomorphism Mprϕqgives anRKpxq-homomorphism ResKprϕqMpyq ÑMpxq.
Lemma 7.7. LetE:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑDbe a target regular extension and Mbe anRC-module.
Letϕ:xÑybe a morphism in D. Consider the following composition of graded R-module
homomorphisms
H˚pKpyq;MpyqqKprϕq˚
Ý Ý Ý Ý ÑH˚pKpxq;ResKprϕqMpyqqMprϕq˚Ý Ý Ý Ý ÑH˚pKpxq;Mpxqq.
where the ﬁrst map is the homomorphism induced by the group ho momorphism Kprϕqand
the second map is the homomorphism induced by the homomorphi smMprϕq:Mpyq ÑMpxq.
Then the composition Mprϕq˚Kprϕq˚does not depend on the choice of the lifting rϕforϕ.
Proof. Ifrϕ1is another lifting of ϕ:xÑy, then rϕ1“ky˝rϕfor somekyPKpyq. From
the deﬁnition of Kprϕq, we see that Kprϕ1q “cky˝Kprϕqwherecky:Kpyq ÑKpyqis the
conjugation map deﬁned by ckypuq “kyuk´1

induced by a pair pKprϕq,Mprϕqqin the sense described in [7, Sect III.8]. We have

The composition Mpkq˚c˚
kdeﬁnes the action of kPKpxqonH˚pKpxq;Mpxqq. By [7, Prop
II.8.3], this action is trivial, hence the composition Mprϕq˚Kprϕq˚does not depend on the
choice of the lifting rϕ. /square
Deﬁnition 7.8. The assignment dÑH˚pKpdq;Mpdqqtogether with the induced homo-
morphisms H˚pKpyq;Mpyqq ÑH˚pKpxq;Mpxqqintroduced in Lemma 7.7 deﬁnes a right
RD-module. We denote this right RD-module by H˚pK;Mq.
Now we are ready to prove:
Lemma 7.9. With the deﬁnitions given above, the isomorphism in Lemma 7. 5 induces an
isomorphism of right RD-modules
H˚pπ{´;ResπCMq –H˚pK;Mq.

Combining Lemma 7.9 with the Gabriel-Zisman spectral seque nce proved in Theorem 5.4
gives the following theorem which is the ext-group version o f LHS-spectral sequence due to
Xu [44].
Theorem 7.10. LetE:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑDbe a target regular extension. Then for every RC-
moduleMandRD-moduleN, there is a spectral sequence

By Lemma 7.9, we can replace the RD-moduleH˚pπ{´;M˝πCqwithH˚pK;Mq.This gives
the desired spectral sequence. /square
If we takeM“Rin Theorem 7.10, we recover the LHS-spectral sequence due to Xu.
Theorem 7.11 (Xu, [44]) .LetE:KÑCÑDbe a target regular extension. Then for
everyRC-moduleM, there is a spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“HppD;HqpK;Mqq ñHp`qpC;Mq.
We call this spectral sequence the LHS-spectral sequence fo r a target regular extension.
This spectral sequence is also constructed in [34, Prop A.11 ].
Remark 7.12. A small category Cis called a ﬁnite category if the set of all morphisms in
Cis ﬁnite. In [45, Prop 4.4], Xu shows that if Cis a ﬁnite category and kis a ﬁeld, then for
everykC-moduleMandN, there is an isomorphism

whereFpCqdenotes the category of factorizations in C(see [3, p. 88]) and ∇:FpCq ÑCˆCop
is the functor that takes ϕ:xÑyinFpCqto the pair py,xqinCˆCop. This suggests that
with some extra work it should be possible to derive the ext-g roup version of the LHS-spectral
sequence from the cohomology version when Cis a ﬁnite category.
For source regular extensions, there is a similar spectral s equence with coeﬃcients in a
leftRC-moduleMobtained by applying Theorem 7.10 to the opposite extension Eop.
Corollary 7.13. LetE:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑDbe a source regular extension. Then for every left
RC-moduleMand leftRD-moduleN, there is a spectral sequence

RCpResπN,M q
whereHqpK;Mqis the leftRD-module whose structure is deﬁned to be the right RDop-
structure of HqpK;Mqcoming from the opposite extension Eop:KÑCopÑDop.
Note that if E:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑDis a source regular extension and if we want to relate the
cohomology of CandDwith right module coeﬃcients, the spectral sequences above cannot
be used. For this we construct a spectral sequence involving the homology groups of the
groupsKpxq. We now explain this spectral sequence:
LetE:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑDbe a source regular extension. For every ϕ:xÑyinD, choose a
lifting rϕ:xÑyinC. The morphism rϕinduces a group homomorphism Kprϕq:Kpyq Ñ
Kpxqdeﬁned byKprϕqpkyq “kxwherekxPKpxqis the unique element satisfying ky˝rϕ“

HqpKpyq;MpyqqKprϕq˚Ý Ý Ý Ý ÑHqpKpxq;ResKpϕqMpyqqMpϕq˚Ý Ý Ý Ý ÑHqpKpxq;Mpxqq.
One can show in a similar way to the way it was done in Lemma 7.7 t hat this homomorphism
does not depend on the lifting rϕforϕ. Hence it deﬁnes a right RD-module structure for the
assignment dÑHqpKpdq,Mpdqq, denoted by HqpK;Mq.
Lemma 7.14. There is an isomorphism of right RD-modules
H˚p´zπ;ResπCMq –H˚pK;Mq.
Proof. A proof can be given by repeating the arguments in the proof of Lemma 7.9 for
homology groups and using the homology groups version of Pro position 6.10. /square
We have the following theorem.
Theorem 7.15. LetE:KiÝ ÑCπÝ ÑDbe a source regular extension. For every right RD-

If we takeM“R, we obtain the following:

8.Spectral sequences for regular EI-categories
Deﬁnition 8.1. A small category Cis called an EI-category if every endomorphism in Cis
an isomorphism.
Many interesting categories that appear in representation theory, such as the orbit cat-
egory, the fusion systems, and the linking systems are EI-ca tegories. We introduce these
examples of EI-categories in Sections 9 and 10.
LetCbe an EI-category. For every xPObpCq, we denote the isomorphism class of xbyrxs
and the set of isomorphism classes of objects in CbyrCs. The set rCsis a partially ordered
set with the order relation given by
rxs ď rysifCpx,yq ‰ H.
We consider the partially ordered set rCsas a category with morphisms given by the order
relation. There is a functor π:CÑ rCsthat sends each xPCto its isomorphism class rxs,
and each morphism ϕ:xÑyto the order relation rxs ď rys.
In general the functor π:CÑ rCsdoes not deﬁne a target (or source) regular extension
of categories. The ﬁrst problem is that the object sets of Cand rCsare not equal in general.
We can remedy this by replacing Cwith its skeletal category skpCq. By Corollary 6.8, this
adjustment does not change the cohomology of the category C.Throughout the paper, we
will assume that every EI-category Cis skeletal, and we identify the equivalence class of
each object xPObpCqwith itself and take ObprCsq “ObpCq. We write xďywhenever
Cpx,yq ‰ H .
Deﬁnition 8.2. An EI-category Cis called target regular if for every x,y PObpCq, the
automorphism group AutCpyqacts regularly (freely with one orbit) on Cpx,yq. An EI-
category Cis called source regular if for every x,y PObpCq,AutCpxqacts regularly on
Cpx,yq.
By deﬁnition, every (skeletal) EI-category Cis target (resp. source) regular if and only
if the functor π:CÑ rCsis target (resp. source) regular. Hence the spectral sequen ces we
obtained in the previous section applies to the functor π:CÑ rCsand gives the following
spectral sequences.
Theorem 8.3. (1) LetCbe a target regular category and Mbe anRC-module. Then,
for everyně0, the assignment xÑHnpAutCpxq;Mpxqqdeﬁnes anRrCs-module
and there is a spectral sequence

(2) LetCbe a source regular category and Mbe a leftRC-module. Then, for every ně0,
the assignment xÑHnpAutCpxq;Mpxqqdeﬁnes a left RrCs-module and there is a
spectral sequence

where all the cohomology groups are cohomology with coeﬃcie nts in a left module.
(3) LetCbe a source regular category and Mbe a rightRrCs-module. Then, for every

a spectral sequence

2“Extp
RrCspHqpAutCp´q;Rq,Mq ñHp`qpC;ResπMq.
Proof. The ﬁrst two spectral sequences follow from Theorem 7.11 and Corollary 7.13. The
third one follows from Corollary 7.16. /square
For an abelian group A, the cohomology of the category Cwith coeﬃcients in Ais deﬁned
as the cohomology of the classifying space BCwith coeﬃcients in A. The cohomology
groupH˚pBC;Aqis isomophic to the cohomology of the category Cwith coeﬃcients in the
constant functor A. Here we can regard the constant functor as either a left modu le or a
rightRC-module, with both cohomology groups being isomorphic to th e cohomology group
H˚pBC;Aq. This gives the following spectral sequence for source regu lar categories.
Corollary 8.4 (Linckelmann [30, Thm 3.1]) .LetCbe a source regular category and Abe
an abelian group. Then, for every ně0, the assignment xÑHnpAutCpxq;Aqdeﬁnes a left
RrCs-module and there is a spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“HpprCs;HqpAutCp´q;Aqq ñHp`qpBC;Aq.
Proof. This follows from the Statement (2) in Theorem 8.3 after taki ng the leftRC-module
Mas the constant functor A. /square
One of the main examples of the source regular category is the subdivision category SpCq
of an EI-category C. We now give the deﬁnition of the subdivision category, foll owing the
terminology in [29].
The simplex category ∆is the category whose objects are the totally ordered sets rns “
t0,1,...,n u, whereně0is an integer, and the morphisms rms Ñ rnsare given by order
preserving maps for all m,n ě0. Let∆injĂ∆denote the subcategory that has same
objects as ∆where the morphisms rms Ñ rnsare given by order preserving injective maps
for allm,n ě0.
LetCbe a small category. A functor σ:rns ÑCis a chain of composable morphisms in
C:
σ:“ pσ0α1Ý Ñσ1α2Ý Ñ ¨ ¨ ¨ Ñσn´1αnÝ Ý Ñσnq
whereσpiqis denoted by σiin the chain. We say a chain σisstrict if the objects σiin the
chain are pairwise non-isomorphic, i.e., distinct, since w e assumed that Cis skeletal.
Deﬁnition 8.5 ([29, §2]) .LetCbe a small category. The subdivision category SpCqofCis
the category whose objects are strict chains σ:rns ÑC, where a morphism from τ:rms ÑC
toσ:rns ÑCis given by a pair pj,µqsuch thatj:rms Ñ rnsis a morphism in ∆injand
µ:τ–σ˝jis a natural isomorphism. The composition of two morphisms pk,νq:ρÑτ
and pj,µq:τÑσinSpCqis deﬁned by
pj,µq ˝ pk,νq “ pj˝k,pµkq ˝νq
whereµk:τ˝k–ρ˝j˝kis the natural isomorphism obtained by precomposing µwithk.
The opposite category SpCqopis denoted by spCq.LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 29
IfCis a poset considered as a category, then the subdivision cat egorySpCqis the poset
category of the strict chains in C, with the order relation given by the inclusion of subchains .
In this case it is well-known that the realizations BCandBSpCqare homeomorphic by the
well-known result on the subdivision of a simplicial comple x. There is a similar observation
for general subdivision categories obtained via a functor f romSpCqtoCwhich we now
explain.
LetFin :SpCq ÑCdenote the functor that sends σ:rns ÑCto the last object σnin the
chain and sends a morphism pj,µq:τÑσto the composition of morphisms
τmµjÝ Ñσjpmqαjpmq`1Ý Ý Ý Ý Ý Ñσjpmq`1αjpmq`2Ý Ý Ý Ý Ý Ñ ¨ ¨ ¨αnÝ Ý Ñσn.
Similarly one can deﬁne the functor Ini :SpCqopÑCthat sendsσ:rns ÑCinSpCqto the
ﬁrst object σ0in the chain and sends a morphism pj,µq:τÑσto the composition of the
following morphisms
σ0α1Ý Ñσ1α2Ý Ñ ¨ ¨ ¨αjp0qÝ Ý Ý Ñσjp0qµ´1
0Ý Ý Ñτ0.
Note that we can view the functor Inias a (covariant) functor Ini :spCq ÑC. For this
functor, we have the following observation due to Słomińska [39].
Proposition 8.6. For any EI-category C, the functor Ini :spCq ÑCis right coﬁnal.
Proof. See [39, Prop 1.5]. /square
Applying Theorem 6.2, we obtain:
Proposition 8.7. LetCbe anEI-category. Then for any RC-moduleM, the map
Ini˚:H˚pC;Mq–Ý ÑH˚pspCq;ResIniMq
induced by the functor Ini :spCq ÑCis an isomorphism.
Proof. This follows from Proposition 8.6 and Theorem 6.2. /square
Proposition 8.7 shows that for the purposes of calculating c ohomology groups of the cate-
goryC, we can replace Cwith the category spCq. Moreover the spectral sequence in Theorem
8.3 applies the functor π:spCq Ñ rspCqs. For this we ﬁrst need to replace spCqwith its skele-
tonskpspCqqand assume that ObpspCqq “ObprspCqsq. Under this assumption the following
holds:
Proposition 8.8. The subdivision category SpCqis a source regular category. Hence spCqis
target regular.
Proof. See [29, Prop 2.3]. /square
Note that since we assumed that spCqis skeletal, there is a unique pre-chosen object for
every isomorphism class of objects. We write isomorphism cl asses as rσsmeaning that σis
the chosen object. For each σPspCq, letAutspCqpσqdenote the automorphism group of σ. If
σ:“ pσ0α1Ý Ñσ1α2Ý Ñσ2Ñ ¨ ¨ ¨ Ñσn´1αnÝ Ý Ñσnq
then an automorphism of σis a sequence of automorphisms paiqwithaiPAutCpσiqsuch
that

for eachi“1,...,n ´1.Letπi: AutspCqpσq ÑAutCpσiqdenote the group homomorphism
that sends paiq PAutspCqpσqtoaiPAutCpσiq.
LetMbe anRC-module and σPspCq. Note that Mpσ0qis anAutCpσ0q-module.
Restriction of this module via π0: AutspCqpσq ÑAutCpσ0qgives anRAutspCqpσq-module
Resπ0pMpσ0qq. We have the following:
Lemma 8.9. With the deﬁnitions given above, for every RC-moduleMand everyσPspCq,
pResIniMqpσq “Resπ0pMpσ0qq.
Combining the observations on this section, we obtain the fo llowing spectral sequence:
Theorem 8.10 (Słomińska [39, Cor 1.13]) .LetCbe an EI-category and Mbe anRC-
module. Then, for every ně0, the assignment rσs ÑHnpAutspCqpσq;Resπ0Mpσ0qqdeﬁnes
anRrspCqs-module, denoted by An, and there is a spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“HpprspCqs;Aqq ñHp`qpC;Mq.
Proof. By Proposition 8.8, the category spCqis target regular. Applying Theorem 8.3(1) to
spCqwith coeﬃcients in ResIniM, we obtain a spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“HpprspCqs;HqpAutspCqp´q;pResIniMqp´qq ñHp`qpspCq;ResIniMq.
By Lemma 8.9, for every σPspCq, we can replace pResIniMqpσqwithResπ0pMpσ0qq. Now
the result follows from the isomorphism in Proposition 8.7. /square
This spectral sequence constructed in [39, Cor 1.13] has a di ﬀerent expression for the E2-
term, but it is easy to see the E2-term of the sequence in [39, Cor 1.13] is isomorphic to the
terms of the spectral sequence given above. This spectral se quence with trivial coeﬃcients
is also constructed in [30].
9.Spectral sequences for the transporter category
LetGbe a discrete group and Hbe a collection of subgroups of G(closed under conju-
gation). The transporter category THpGqis the category whose objects are the subgroups
HPHand whose morphisms are given by
MorTHpGqpH,K q “NGpH,K q:“ tgPG|gHg´1ďKu.
Composition of two morphisms is deﬁned by group multiplicat ion. We are interested in the
following quotient categories of the transporter category .
Deﬁnition 9.1. LetGbe a discrete group and Hbe a collection of subgroups of G.
(1) The orbit category OHpGqis the category whose objects are the subgroups HPH
and whose morphisms are given by
MorOHpGqpH,K q “ tKg|gPG,gHg´1ďKu.
(2) The fusion category FHpGqis the category whose objects are the subgroups HPH
and whose morphisms are given by
MorFHpGqpH,K q “ tgCGpHq |gPG,gHg´1ďKu.LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 31
(3) The fusion orbit category FHpGqqis the category whose objects are the subgroups
HPHand whose morphisms are given by
MorFHpGqpH,K q “ tKgCGpHq |gPG,gHg´1ďKu.
The morphisms in the orbit category can be identiﬁed with the G-mapsG{HÑG{K
between the G-sets of the left cosets G{HandG{K. The morphisms in the fusion category
can be viewed as group homomorphisms cg:HÑKinduced by conjugation with gPG.
Note that the fusion orbit category is a quotient category of the fusion category. We have
MorFHpGqpH,K q –InnpKqzMorFHpGqpH,K q
whereInnpKq –K{ZpKqis the group of conjugations ck:KÑKinduced by elements
kPK. The relationship between these categories can be describe d by the following diagram
where each arrow represents the projection functor to the co rresponding quotient category.

The quotient maps π1andπ2deﬁne extensions of categories and the corresponding LHS-
spectral sequences for these extensions are well-known spe ctral sequences. They are related
to the subgroup and centralizer decompositions for the coho mology of the group G.
9.1.Subgroup decomposition. For everyH,K PH, the leftK-action onNGpH,K qis
free. Hence the quotient map π1:THpGq ÑOHpGqdeﬁnes a target regular extension
E:tKuKPHÑTHpGqπ1Ý ÑOHpGq.
Applying Theorem 7.11 to this extension, we obtain:
Proposition 9.2. For everyRTHpGq-moduleM, there is a spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“HppOHpGq;Hq
Mq ñHp`qpTHpGq;Mq
whereHq
Mis theROHpGq-module such that Hq
MpKq “HqpK;MpKqqfor everyKPH.
In this case, the ROHpGqmodule structure can be described as follows: Given a G-map
f:G{HÑG{K, letgPGsuch thatfpHq “g´1K. ThengHg´1ďK. TheTHpGqaction

a homomorphism
H˚pK;MpKqqc˚
gÝ ÑH˚pH;RescgMpKqqMpfq˚Ý Ý Ý Ý ÑH˚pH;MpHqq.
This is the ROHpGq-module structure for the assignment KÑHqpK;MpKqq.
LetKHdenote the simplicial complex whose simplices are chains in Hwith the order
relation given by inclusion of subgroups. The realization o f the transporter category |THpGq|32 ERGÜN YALÇIN
is homotopy equivalent to the Borel construction EGˆGKH(see [14, Rem 2.2]). If we take
theRTHpGq-moduleMto be the constant functor A, then we obtain a spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“limp
OHpGqHqp´;Aq ñHp`qpEGˆGKH;Aq.
whereHqp´;Aqdenotes the q-th group cohomology functor considered as an ROHpGq-
module.
Deﬁnition 9.3. A collection of subgroups Hof a ﬁnite group Gis called ample if
H˚pEGˆGKH;Fpq –H˚pBG;Fpq.
Any collection that includes the trivial subgroup is an ampl e collection, hence the collection
of allp-subgroups in Gis an ample collection. The collection of all nontrivial p-subgroups
in a ﬁnite group Gis also ample when pdivides the order of G(see Brown [7, Sect X.7]). A
list of all ample collections of subgroups in a ﬁnite group ca n be found in [15] and [4].
WhenHis an ample collection, the spectral sequence above gives a s pectral sequence of
the form
Ep,q
2“limp
OHpGqHqp´;Fpq ñHp`qpBG;Fpq.
This spectral sequence is usually constructed as the Bousﬁel d-Kan spectral sequence of the
mod-psubgroup decomposition of BG(see [11, Sect 7]). For inﬁnite groups with ﬁnite virtual
cohomological dimension (vcd), a similar spectral sequenc e involving Farrell cohomology is
constructed in [26, Thm 4.6].
9.2.Centralizer decomposition. For everyH,K PH, the rightCGpHq-action onNGpH,K q
is free. Hence the functor π2:THpGq ÑFHpGqdeﬁnes a source regular extension
E:tCGpHquHPHÑTHpGqπ2Ý ÑFHpGq.
Applying Corollary 7.13 to this extension, we obtain:
Proposition 9.4. For every left RTHpGq-moduleM, there is a spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“HppFHpGq;Hq
C,Mq ñHp`qpTHpGq;Mq
whereHq
C,Mis the leftRFHpGq-module such that Hq
C,MpHq “HqpCGpHq;MpHqqfor every
HPH.
The leftRFHpGq-module structure can be deﬁned in a similar way to the orbit c ategory
case. The diﬀerence here is that since the extension is sourc e regular, the action of THpGq
onK“ tCGpHquHPHis given by a contravariant functor, i.e. cg:HÑKinduces a group
homomorphism CGpKq ÑCGpHq. So the induced action on cohomology is given by a
covariant functor.
As in the subgroup decomposition case, if we take the left RTCpGq-moduleMto be the
constant functor Fp, andHto be an ample collection, then we obtain a spectral sequence
Ep,q
2“limp
FHpGqHqpCGp´q;Fpq ñHp`qpBG;Fpq.
This spectral sequence is the same spectral sequence as the Bo usﬁeld-Kan spectral sequence
associated to the centralizer decomposition of BG(see [11, §7]). For inﬁnite groups with
ﬁnite vcd, a spectral sequence for the centralizer decompos ition over the collection of all
nontrivial elementary abelian p-subgroups is constructed in [25].LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 33
9.3.Normalizer decomposition. The transporter category THpGqis an EI-category, so
we can apply Theorem 8.10 to THpGqto obtain a spectral sequence
Ep.q
2“HpprspTHpGqqs;Aq
Tq ñHp`qpTHpGq;Mq
whereMis a right THpGq-module and Aq
Tis theRrspTHpGqs-module such that
Aq
Tprσsq “HqpAutspTHpGqqpσq;Resπ0Mpσ0qq.
Every strict chain
σ:“ pH0α1Ý ÑH1α2Ý Ñ ¨ ¨ ¨αnÝ Ý ÑHnq
inTHpGqis isomorphic to a strict chain where all the morphisms αiare inclusion of subgroups.
Hence we can take the representatives of isomorphism classe s of chains of morphisms to be
the strictly increasing chains of subgroups σ:“ pH0ăH1ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ăHnqinH. For such a
chainσ, we have
AutspTHpGqqpσq “NGpσq:“ tgPG|gHig´1ďHifor alliu.
LetSpHqbe the poset category of strictly increasing chains in Hwith order relation given by
inclusion of subchains, and spHqdenote its opposite category. The category of the G-orbits
of chains in H, denoted by spHq{G, is the category whose objects are G-orbits of strict chains
inHand whose morphisms are deﬁned in such a way that there is a mor phism rσs Ñ rτsif
there is agPGsuch thatτis subchain of gσ. The poset category rspTHpGqqsof isomorphism
classes of chains in spTHpGqqcan be identiﬁed with spHq{G. Hence we conclude:
Proposition 9.5. For everyRTHpGq-moduleM, there is a spectral sequence of the form
Ep.q
2“HppspHq{G;Nqq ñHp`qpTHpGq;Mq
whereNqis theRpspHq{Gq-module such that Nqprσsq “HqpNGpσq;Resπ0Mpσ0qqfor every
rσsGinspHq{G.
As before, if we take Mto be the constant functor Fp, andHto be an ample collection,
then we obtain a spectral sequence
Ep.q
2“limp
spHq{GHqpNGp´q;Fpq ñHp`qpBG;Fpq.
This is the same spectral sequence as the Bousﬁeld-Kan spectr al sequence for the normalizer
decomposition of the classifying space of G(see [11, §7]).
A collection of subgroups His called normalizer sharp if in the above spectral sequence
we haveEp,q
2“0for allpą0andqě0. For ﬁnite groups, there are many normalizer sharp
collections of p-subgroups (see [15]). When the collection His normalizer sharp, this spectral
sequence allows us to calculate the cohomology groups of Gin terms of the cohomology of
the normalizers of chains of subgroups in H.
9.4.Orbit and fusion orbit category. In general the projection functors π3:OHpGq Ñ
FHpGqandπ4:FHpGq ÑFHpGqthat are deﬁned above are not regular functors as the
following counterexamples illustrate:
Example 9.6. Forπ3:OHpGq ÑFHpGq, letHbe any collection such that 1,KPHwith
K‰1. ThenMorOHpGqp1,Kq –G{Kand the centralizer CGp1q “Gdoes not act freely
onG{K. This shows that π3is not source regular. For π4:FHpGq ÑFHpGq, letHbe34 ERGÜN YALÇIN
a collection such that 1,KPHwhereKis a nonabelian group. Then MorFHpGqp1,Kq –
G{CGp1q –1andInnpKq –K{ZpKq ‰1, soInnpKqdoes not act freely on MorFHpGqp1,Kq.
Henceπ4is not a target regular functor for the collection H.
In some special cases the functors π3andπ4deﬁne regular extensions. One important
special case is the following: Let Gbe a ﬁnite group. A p-subgroupPďGis called
p-centric ifZpPqis a Sylow p-subgroup of the centralizer CGpPq. In this case we have
CGpPq –ZpPq ˆC1
GpPqwhereC1
GpPqis a subgroup of CGpPqwith order coprime to p. Let
Cedenote the collection of p-centric subgroups in G. WhenH“Ce, we denote OHpGqby
OcpGqandFHpGqbyFcpGq.
Lemma 9.7. The projection functor π3:OcpGq ÑFcpGqdeﬁnes a source regular extension
tC1
GpPquPPCeÑOcpGqπ3Ý ÑFcpGq.
Proof. For everyp-centric subgroup PďG, we have
kertpπ3qP,P: AutOcpGqpPq ÑAutFcpGqpPqu

MorOcpGqpP,Q q –QzNGpP,Q q – tQg|gPG, gPg´1ďQu.
For everycPC1

GpPq, the equality Qgc “Qgholds, then gcg´1PQ
which implies that c“1becausechas order coprime to p. Therefore C1
GpPqacts freely on
MorOcpGqpP,Q q, henceπ3deﬁnes a source regular extension. /square
Applying the spectral sequence in Corollary 7.16 to the exte nsion in Lemma 9.7, for every
RFHpGq-moduleM, we obtain a spectral sequence
Ep,q

In this case, the spectral sequence collapses at the E2-page to the horizontal line at q“0.
As a consequence we obtain the following:
Proposition 9.8 (Broto-Levi-Oliver [5, Lem 1.3]) .LetGbe a ﬁnite group and Rbe ap-local
ring. Then for every RFHpGq-moduleM, there is an isomorphism
H˚pFcpGq;Mq –H˚pOcpGq;Resπ3Mq
induced by the functor π3:OHpGq ÑFHpGq.
WhenGis an inﬁnite discrete group that realizes a fusion system F, there is a similar
extension of categories and a spectral sequence. In this cas e the kernel is given by a signalizer
functor and one obtains a spectral sequence with two horizon tal lines (see [16, §7]).LHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 35
10.Spectral sequences for linking systems
LetGbe a ﬁnite group and Sbe a Sylow p-subgroup of G. The centric linking system

For a ﬁnite group Gwith Sylow p-subgroupS,the fusion system of Gdeﬁned on Sis

There is a spectral sequence associated to this source regul ar extension. In the next section,
we discuss this extension in more general context of p-local ﬁnite groups.

For every fusion system F, there is a unique associated centric linking system L(see [8]).
The triple pS,F,Lqis called ap-local ﬁnite group . For every ﬁnite group Gwith Sylow p-
subgroupS, the triple pS,FSpGq,Lc
SpGqqis ap-local ﬁnite group (see [6, §1]). By condition
(2) in Deﬁnition 10.2, we can conclude the following:
Lemma 10.3. For everyp-local ﬁnite group pS,F,Lq, the projection map π:LÑFc
deﬁnes a source regular extension
E:tZpPquPPFcδÝ ÑLπÝ ÑFc
whereδP:ZpPq ÑAutLpPqis the homomorphism deﬁned as the restriction of the homo-
morphismǫP,P:NSpPq ÑAutLpPqtoZpPq.
Note that this is the p-local ﬁnite group version of the extension given in 10.1. Th is exten-
sion is one of the examples given by Xu in [44, Example 4.1.1] f or source regular extensions
of categories. Applying Theorem 8.3 to this extension gives two spectral sequences, one with
coeﬃcients in a left RL-module, one with (right) RFc-modules. Here we state the one with
RFc-modules:
Proposition 10.4. LetpS,F,Lqbe ap-local ﬁnite group. For every RFc-moduleM, there

TheRFc-module structure on HqpZpPq;Rqis deﬁned by the L-action on the kernel K“

and it induces a group homomorphism Zprϕq:ZpQq ÑZpPqsince the above extension isLHS-SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR REGULAR EXTENSIONS OF CATEGORI ES 37
source regular. The induced map Zprϕq˚:HqpZpQq;Rq ÑHqpZpPq;Rqdeﬁnes the (right)
RFc-module structure used in the Proposition 10.4.
10.2.Subgroup decomposition for L.LetpS,F,Lqbe ap-local ﬁnite group. The orbit
category of Fis the category OpFqwhose objects are subgroups of Sand the morphisms
are given by
MorOpFqpP,Q q:“InnpQqzMorFpP,Q q.
We denote by OcpFqthe full subcategory of OpFqwhose objects are the F-centric subgroups
ofS. There is a quotient functor π1:FcÑOcpFqwhich sends a morphism PÑQinFc
to its orbit under InnpQq-action. Let rπ:LÑOcpFqdenote the composition
rπ:LπÝ ÑFcπ1
Ý ÑOcpFq.
Lemma 10.5. For everyp-local ﬁnite group pS,F,Lq, the functor rπ:LÑOpFcqdeﬁnes a
target regular extension
E:tPuPPFcjÝ ÑLrπÝ ÑOcpFq
where for every PPFc, the homomorphism jP:PÑAutLpPqis the restriction of ǫP,P:
NSpPq ÑAutLpPqto the subgroup P.
Proof. InL, every morphism is a monomorphism and an epimorphism in the c ategorical
sense (see [28, Remark 2.10 and Prop 2.11]). So, the left jQpQqaction on MorLpP,Q qis free.
Now we will show that the projection functor rπ:LÑOcpFqinduces a bijection
jQpQqzMorLpP,Q q –MorOcpFqpP,Q q.
Suppose that ϕ1,ϕ2PMorLpP,Q qare such that ϕ2“jQpgqϕ1for somegPQ. By (3) in

is well-deﬁned. It is surjective because both πandπ1are surjective on morphisms. For
injectivity assume that ϕ1,ϕ2PMorLpP,Q qare such that rπpϕ1q “ rπpϕq. then there is a

Applying Theorem 8.3 to this extension gives the following s pectral sequence (see [34,
Lem 4.2]):
Proposition 10.6. LetpS,F,Lqbe ap-local ﬁnite group. Then, for every RL-moduleM,
there is a spectral sequence

This spectral sequence also follows from the subgroup decom position for the linking system
L(see [6, Prop 2.2]). For nontrivial coeﬃcients this spectra l sequence is a special case of the
spectral sequence given for transporter categories (see [3 4, Lem 4.2]). There are two open
problems related to the spectral sequence given in Proposit ion 10.6.
Conjecture 10.7 (Sharpness Problem [9]) .LetpS,F,Lqbe ap-local ﬁnite group. Then for
everypą0andqě0,

For fusion systems realized by a ﬁnite group, the statement o f the conjecture is proved by
Diaz and Park [9]. For a reduction of this problem to fusion sy stems with nontrivial center
see [46].
The second problem related to subgroup decomposition is abo ut cohomology of linking
systems with nontrivial local coeﬃcient systems. For detai ls of this problem we refer the
reader to [32] and [33].
10.3.Normalizer decomposition for p-local ﬁnite groups. LetpS,F,Lqbe ap-local
ﬁnite group. The centric linking system Lis an EI-category, so we can apply Theorem 8.10
toL. For every RL-moduleM, we obtain a spectral sequence of the form

We have the following:

withPi‰Pi`1. We can take representatives of L-isomorphism classes of chains of morphisms

are isomorphic. /square

(see [28, Def 1.4] for details). For each jP rns, the group homomorphism
πj: AutLpσq ÑAutLpPjq
is deﬁned by pα0,...,αnq Ñαj. With these deﬁnitions, the spectral sequence in 10.2 gives
a spectral sequence stated in the following theorem.
Theorem 10.10. LetpS,F,Lqbe ap-local ﬁnite group. For every RL-moduleM, there is
a spectral sequence

This spectral sequence can also be obtained as the Bousﬁeld-K an spectral sequence for
the normalizer decomposition of |L|proved by Libman in [28, Thm A].

It is an open problem whether or not the normalizer decomposi tion is sharp. It is proved
in [46, Thm 1.9] that the normalizer decomposition for Lis sharp if and only if the subgroups

10.4.Normalizer decomposition of OcpFq.LetFbe a fusion system over Sand let

spectral sequence
Ep.q

Ois the rspOcpFqs-module such that
Aq
Oprσsq “HqpAutspOcpFqqpσq;Resπ0Mpσ0qq
for every rσs P rspOpFcqqs. We have the following observation:
Lemma 10.12. The poset category rspOcpFqqsis isomorphic to the category sdpFcq.
Proof. Letϕ:PÑQbe a morphism in OcpFqand rϕ:PÑQbe a lifting of ϕinFc
under the quotient functor π1:FcÑOcpFq. The morphism rϕ:PÑQcan be written as a
composition of an isomorphism rϕ1:PÑrϕpPqand an inclusion map inc:rϕpPqãÑQ. Hence
ϕ:PÑQcan be written as a composition of π1prϕ1qandπ1pincq. Moreover a morphism in
OcpFqis an isomorphism if and only if its lifting in Fcis an isomorphism. This shows that
every chain of morphisms P0ϕ1Ý ÑP1Ñ ¨ ¨ ¨ϕnÝ ÑPninspOcpFqqis isomorphic to a chain where
all the maps ϕiare of the images of inclusion maps under π1. This gives an isomorphism
between poset categories spOcpFqqandsdpFcq. /square
Combining 10.3 with Lemma 10.12 we obtain the following spec tral sequence:
Theorem 10.13. LetpS,F,Lqbe ap-local ﬁnite group. Then for every right ROpFcq-
moduleM, there is a spectral sequence
Ep.q
2“HppsdpFcq;Aq
Oq ñHp`qpOpFcq;Mq
whereAq
Ois the leftRsdpFcq-module such that Aq
Oprσsq “HqpAutspOpFcqqpσq;Resπ0MpP0qq
for every rσsinsdpFcq.
This spectral sequence has some similarity to the spectral s equence constructed in Theo-
rem [46, Thm 1.7], but in general the E2-terms of these two spectral sequences are diﬀerent.
