The Cosmic Gems arc is among the brightest and highly magnified galax-
ies observed at redshift z∼10.2[1]. However, it is an intrinsically UV
faint galaxy, in the range of those now thought to drive the reionization
of the universe [2–4]. Hitherto the smallest features resolved in a galaxy
at a comparable redshift are between a few hundreds and a few tens of
parsecs [5, 6]. Here we report JWST observations of the Cosmic Gems.
The light of the galaxy is resolved into five star clusters located in a
region smaller than 70 parsec. They exhibit minimal dust attenuation
and low metallicity, ages younger than 50 Myr and intrinsic masses of
∼106M⊙. Their lensing-corrected sizes are approximately 1 pc, resulting
in stellar surface densities near 105M⊙/pc2, three orders of magnitude
higher than typical young star clusters in the local universe [7]. Despite
the uncertainties inherent to the lensing model, they are consistent with
being gravitationally bound stellar systems, i.e., proto-globular clusters.
We conclude that star cluster formation and feedback likely contributed
3to shape the properties of galaxies during the epoch of reionization.
The Cosmic Gems arc (SPT0615-JD1) was initially discovered in HST images
obtained by the RELICS survey of the lensing galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615 −5746 at
z= 0.972 and reported as a redshift z= 10 candidate [8].
A recent JWST/NIRCam imaging campaign of this field has observed the Cosmic
Gems arc with eight bands covering 0.8 to 5 µm range (Methods). Spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting to the JWST photometry indicates that the Cosmic Gems
galaxy has a fairly young stellar population with mass-weighted age <79 Myr and a
lensing-corrected stellar mass in the range 2.4–5.6 ×107M⊙, with low dust extinction
(AV<0.15 mag) and metallicity ( <1%Z⊙) [1].
The FUV–to–optical rest-frame of Cosmic Gems arc reveals bright clumpy struc-
tures and extended faint emission over a 5′′-long arc (Fig. 1). The symmetry between
the south–east (hereafter Img.1 ) and the north–west ( Img.2 ) part of the arc uncov-
ers two lensed mirror images of the galaxy, implying that the Cosmic Gems arc is
observed at very high magnification on the lensing critical curve. Four independent
magnification models have been created to account for the galaxy appearance. All the
models successfully reproduce the z= 10.2 critical line crossing the Cosmic Gems arc
(Methods).
Five star cluster candidates are uniquely identified in Img.1 . InImg.2 , three sources
are clearly distinguishable in the F150W filter (Fig. 1), along with a fourth fainter
source (E.2). The appearance of Img.2 is likely perturbed by further lensing effects due
to the northern galaxy at z∼2.6 (visible in the upper right corner) and possibly by an
undetected small scale perturber closer to the arc [1]. Source D.2 is possibly blended
with C.2, and is therefore identified for the remaining of the analysis as C.2+D.2. The
source E.2 is only detected at a 2 σlevel and not included in this analysis (Methods).
The observed projected distance between the A.1 and E.1 clusters in Img.1 is about
40.65′′. Using forward modelling and Lenstool-A predictions presented in Methods, we
find that their physical distance is 42+29
−5pc. The star clusters are all located within
this compact region (Fig. 1). The size of this region is similar to that reported for
individual stellar clumps observed in the moderately-lensed galaxies at redshift z∼10
[2, 5].

The intrinsic physical properties of these 5 star clusters are particularly meaningful
for probing proto-GC formation mechanisms as well as their potential evolution. As
described in Methods, we find that A.1 is only marginally resolved, with an observed
effective half-light radius Reff,obs= 0.6 px, while C.1 and B.2 are consistent with
being unresolved. For the latter sources, we assumed an upper-limit to their radii
coincident with the half-width half maximum (HWHM) of the stellar PSF in the
F150W (0 .025′′= 1.25 px). To derive lensing-corrected R eff, we assumed the predicted
Lenstool-A tangential magnifications at the location of the star clusters (listed in
Extended Data Table 3). The 5 star clusters have intrinsic R effclose to 1 pc (within
5uncertainties, Table 1). Using the other lensing models produces similar size ranges
(0.3 to 0.9 pc for Lenstool-B and 0.3 to 1.2 pc for Glafic ). Independent intrinsic sizes
(Reff,FMin Table 1) have been derived by projecting the star cluster shapes from
the source plane into the image plane. The latter method recovered intrinsic sizes in
excellent agreement, within the uncertainties, with those measured in the image plane,
strengthening the reliability of the derived values.
The star clusters have been fitted with BAGPIPES [9] and PROSPECTOR [10].
We tested different star formation history (SFH) assumptions that simulate a single
burst (inherent to the small sizes of the stellar systems analysed), different high-mass
limits of the initial mass function (IMF), and models with stellar binaries (presented
in Methods). Despite the assumptions, the resulting cluster physical properties (ages,
masses, extinction, metallicities) are in reasonable agreement. In the analysis presented
here, we use the physical values derived with a SFH based on a single exponential
decline with τ= 1 Myr (listed in Extended Data Table 2).
The recovered ages of the star cluster candidates are between 9 and 36 Myr. The
age range suggests that star formation has been propagating within this compact area
of the galaxy for a few tens of Myr. The measured rest-frame UV slopes of the star
clusters ( βbetween −1.8 and −2.5, with Fλ∼λβ, listed in Extended Data Table 1)
are similar to those found for more evolved star clusters in the Sunburst arc at redshift
2.37 [11]. While the Cosmic Gems clusters are not extremely young, they have likely
delivered large amounts of energy and momentum to their host galaxy.
The lensing-corrected stellar masses range between 1.0 – 2.6 ×106M⊙, for a total
combined stellar mass of 8 .3×106M⊙. The total mass of the clusters is close to 30%
of the total stellar mass of the host. Since the mass-weighted age of the galaxy and
those of the star clusters are comparable, one can extrapolate the cluster formation
efficiency (CFE) [12] to be around 30 %. A caution note is necessary, since the mass
estimates (both for the galaxy and star clusters) are subjected to magnification values
6and SED fit uncertainties, making the quoted CFE uncertain. A more direct way to
establish the CFE is to use the fraction of observed FUV light in star clusters with
respect to the host. This quantity is not affected by the same degeneracy as the mass
estimates and, thus, is a more reliable indicator of the CFE, under the assumption that
the FUV light is produced by stellar populations formed during a similar timescale (as
we find here). The analysed star clusters account for ∼60 % of the total F150W flux
of the host extracted within an elliptical Kron aperture (0.51 ±0.01µJy, corresponding
to an intrinsic FUV ABmag of −17.8 after lensing correction, [1]), thus reinforcing the
conclusion that star formation in star clusters is a major mode for the Cosmic Gems arc
and high-redshift galaxies with similar physical properties. This observationally driven
conclusion is supported by high-resolution numerical simulations [13] and analytical
models [14] that find that compact star clusters with sizes 0.5 – 2 pc are the dominant
star formation mode in the first low-metallicity dwarf galaxies. The compactness of
the star clusters appears also to drive the leakage of hydrogen ionizing radiation from
their natal molecular cloud [15], making the star clusters observed here potential
contributors to cosmic reionization. Massive star clusters like those observed in the
Cosmic Gems arc are predicted by the feedback-free starburst model by [16], and could
be at the root of the super-Eddington conditions necessary to launch strong outflows in
short timescales [17], both models aimed to explain the bright UV luminosity reported
forz >9 galaxies.
The resulting stellar surface densities of the clusters are ∼105M⊙/pc2(Table 1).
Consistent physical properties have been reported in star clusters detected in the
Sunrise arc at z∼6 [18] and the Sunburst arc at z= 2.37 [19] (see Fig. 2). Using
the derived ages, masses, and intrinsic sizes, we also determine whether these stellar
systems are gravitationally bound. According to the framework introduced by [20],
a star cluster is considered bound if its age is greater than the crossing time of the
system (where tcross = 10p
R3
eff/GM ), or in other words, under the assumption of
7virial equilibrium, a cluster is gravitationally bound if Π = Age /tcross>1. The log(Π)
values reported in Table 1 are all significantly larger than unity,
indicating that we are indeed detecting star clusters in an early galaxy, 460 Myr
after the Big Bang. This conclusion is valid in spite of the uncertainties inherent to
physical quantity estimates as well as lensing models.
The Cosmic Gems arc clusters (Fig. 2) have significantly higher stellar densities
and smaller sizes than typical young star clusters observed in the local universe [7] as
well as GCs in the Milky Way [21]. The offset with respect to young star clusters in the
local universe is expected since the conditions under which star formation operates in
reionization–era galaxies are more extreme (e.g, more compact, harbour harder ionis-
ing radiation fields, and reach higher electron densities and temperatures,[6, 22]). The
offset with respect to local GCs could be explained in terms of dynamical evolution.
GCs are hot stellar systems where stars continuously exchange energy and momen-
tum. Three different internal mechanisms contribute to their dynamical evolution over
a Hubble time: (i) mass-loss due to stellar evolution; (ii) relaxation due to N-body
interactions; (iii) formation and dynamics of stellar black holes (SBHs) [23, 24]. Mass
loss due to stellar evolution drives GCs’ adiabatic expansion under the condition of
virial equilibrium. A typical mass-loss of 50 % will expand the initial radius of the
cosmic Gems proto-GCs by a factor of 2, while density will decrease correspondingly
by a factor of 8 [23]. Relaxation time scales (shortened by the presence of SBHs [25])
will also contribute to their expansion. Finally, external tidal fields will further affect
the dynamical evolution of these bound stellar systems, which appear to be bona fide
proto-GCs.
Very dense stellar clusters (Σ ∗∼105M⊙/pc2, which for R eff= 1 pc correspond to
ρh∼105M⊙/pc3), like those detected in the Cosmic Gems arc, are predicted to form
in low metallicity and highly dense gas [26], where radiative pressure cannot counteract
the collapse, resulting in extremely high star formation efficiencies ( ∼80% [27]). The
8high stellar densities found in these proto-GCs imply a significant increase in stellar BH
mergers in their interiors [28, 29] and therefore pave the way to intermediate mass BH
seeds [30]. With stellar masses >105M⊙, these star clusters naturally harbour Wolf-
Rayet and very massive stars [31], and because of their elevated stellar densities, satisfy
the necessary condition to form supermassive stars in runaway collisions within their
cores [32]. These different classes of stars are among the potential polluters that could
explain the observed nitrogen enrichment in the ionised gas of high-redshift galaxies
[33], possibly linked to the formation of the chemically enriched stellar populations
ubiquitously found in Milky Way GCs [34].
Cosmological simulations that focus on Milky Way disk-like assembly find that the
majority of its GC population form at redshift z <7 [35–37], suggesting that these star
clusters forming at z ∼10 might build up the GC populations of more massive early
type galaxies in the local Universe. It is difficult to predict whether the proto-GCs
of the Cosmic Gems arc will survive a Hubble time. Their chances would be highly
enhanced if they were ejected into their host halo during dynamical interactions (e.g.,
[12]).
Methods
Size & flux measurements
The JWST NIRCam [38] observations of the SPT-CL J0615–5746 galaxy cluster were
obtained in 2023 September (GO 4212: PI Bradley) using four short-wavelength (SW)
filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, and F200W) and four long-wavelength (LW) filters
(F277W, F356W, F410M, and F444W) spanning 0.8 – 5.0 µm. Each filter had an
exposure time of 2920.4 s. The data were reduced with the grizli (version 1.9.5)
reduction package [39]. They suffered from strong wisps [40] and required special
background subtraction as described in [1]. The final data are in units of 10 nJy. The
NIRCam SW (LW) images were drizzled to a pixel scale of 0.02 (0.04)′′/pixel. For
9further details on the observations and image reduction, please see [1]. We assume
throughout the analysis a cosmology with H0= 67.7 km s−1Mpc−1and Ω m= 0.31
[41]. Under these assumptions, 1 SW pixel (0.02′′) corresponds to 83.7 pc at z= 10.2.
We derived the star cluster radii and multiband photometry by applying the
method published and tested in [42–44]. We simultaneously fitted for the shape of
the light distribution, the flux and the local background (including the galaxy diffuse
light) of each of the identified clusters in the reference filter, F150W, which offers the
sharpest view of the clusters. Empirical PSFs in all filters used in this work were built
by selecting stars in each band. We fitted the PSF out to 0.4′′with an analytical
expression, which was then convolved with varying 2D Gaussians to create a grid of
models. Intrinsic sizes (de-convolved by PSF) have then been derived by fitting the
observed light distribution of each cluster with this grid of 2D Gaussian models in the
F150W. Due to the large shear effects, compact sources might appear resolved in the
shear direction ( ystd) [e.g., 45]. We assumed that the measured major-axis y stdof the
2D Gaussian ellipse is the standard deviation of a 2D circular Gaussian which we trans-
lated into the observed PSF-deconvolved effective radius, R eff,obs=ystd×p
2ln(2).
The derived R eff,obsare reported in Table 1. The de-lensed intrinsic effective half-light
radii, R eff, have been determined by dividing Reff,obsby the tangential magnification
µtan(reported in Extended Data Table 3).

10For each star cluster, the flux in the reference filter has been determined by inte-
grating the fitted shape and subtracting the local background. We then measured the
fluxes in the other bands by convolving the derived intrinsic shape in F150W with the
empirical PSF of the respective bands. Fitting this model to the other bands, we let
the centre, normalisation, and local background (including the galaxy diffuse light) as
free parameters.
The intrinsic sizes and observed fluxes in the reference filter F150W were derived
using a cutout box centered on the source with size of 11 ×11 px (about 4 times the
FWHM) for A.1, A.2. Larger box sizes did not produce noticeable differences in the
output sizes and fluxes. Due to their proximity, B.1, C.1, D.1, and E.1 have been fitted
simultaneously within a box of 15 ×15 px. A larger box size, produces consistent values
within the uncertanties of measurements for B.1 and C.1, while E.1 gets increasingly
elongated, affecting the fit of D.1. To avoid this degeneracy, we fix the box size to
15×15, which would correspond to fix the source ellepticity of the faint E.1 to 2.
Similarly, B.2, C.2, and D.2 were fitted simultaneously within a box of 11 ×11 (changing
the box size does not produce noticeable effects on the recovered parameters). We
notice that we do not see two maxima at the location of C.2 and D.2, so we allowed the
fit to optimise the centre of a second hidden source. We repeated the fit of this region
by assuming only one source. Both approaches produced similar residuals. The flux
extracted by assuming only one source is comparable within uncertainties to the flux
extracted by fitting for C.2 and D.2. Due to the degeneration in identifying the position
of D.2, we extracted physical properties by fitting only one source which we refer to
as C.2+D.2. Due to the faintness of E.2 (2 σ), our method did not produce significant
constraints. We therefore excluded E.2 from our analysis. In the BAGPIPES- expfit
we find that C.1 and D.1 have similar ages and a combined total mass of about 2 ×106
M⊙. C.2+D.2 has a slightly older age (but in agreement within 1 σ) than C.1 and D.1.
11The total mass and size of C.2+D.2 is a factor of two higher than their counterparts,
corroborating the idea that the two star clusters are blended in Img.2 .
The size uncertainties were derived by bootstrapping the fit of the source taking
into account the RMS of the local background. The photometric errors include the
latter uncertainties as well as the sum in quadrature of the local background variance
estimated within the box where the sources have been fitted. Aperture corrections
have been extrapolated up to 0.4′′in all bands.
In Extended Data Fig. 1, we show the best model of the star clusters and the
residual image in the reference filter and two more bands. The extraction of the sources
does not produce significant artificial residuals above the RMS of the image.
Independent measurements of intrinsic R effhave been obtained following the for-
ward modeling method of [46]. Briefly, this method creates a model of the galaxy in
the source plane, then projects that model into the image plane. After convolving
with the measured empirical PSF, the image plane model is compared to the observed
data. The source plane model parameters are first optimized using a downhill simplex
algorithm, then sampled using an MCMC with the Python package emcee [47].
For SPT0615-JD1, the source plane model consisted of five Sersic profiles centered
on the five identified clumps A.1–E.1 (Extended Data Fig. 2). No diffuse component of
the arc has been included in this analysis, due to the faintness of this component with
respect to the clusters. Separately, we modelled clumps A.2–C.2 on the other side of
the lensing critical curve. Uncertainties in the Lenstool-A lens model resulted in slight
offsets between source plane positions of clumps on opposite sides of the critical curve,
which prevents simultaneous fitting of the two images of the arc. We found similar
results for clump sizes on both sides of the critical curve, with clump radii ranging
from 0.7–1.1 pc (see Table 1).
12SED fitting analysis
We performed SED fitting with BAGPIPES [9] and test the derived physical proper-
ties against different assumptions, as well as with a different software PROSPECTOR
[10]. For all the runs we fix the redshift at z= 10.2, as measured by [1]. The stan-
dard stellar population templates were reprocessed with Cloudy to generate nebular
continuum and line information (see [48] for comparisons of the two code implemen-
tations). In both codes we assume a Kroupa IMF, unless otherwise specified. We
constrain SFHs to prescriptions that reproduce a short burst in all tests except one
where τis free to vary. The short burst assumption is in agreement with studies of stel-
lar cluster and GC populations in the local universe ([12, 34]). The recovered median
of the posterior distributions of age, mass, A V, metallicity, and associated 68% uncer-
tainties are reported in Extended Data Table 2. We let the ionization parameter, U,
to change between −2 and−3.5. We assumed a Calzetti attenuation [49] but test also
the SMC extinction. In the reference set, used to produce results reported in Fig. 2
and Table 1 and referred to as BAGPIPES- exp, we assumed an exponential decline
with a very short τ= 1 Myr and Calzetti attenuation. The panels in Extended Data
Fig. 3 show the observed SEDs of the 5 star clusters identified in Img.1 (black dots
with uncertainties). When available, we include the observed SED of the corresponding
clusters in Img.2 (orange stars with associated errors). The latter have been normal-
ized by the median flux ratio in the 6 bands of the corresponding source in Img.1 to
match the flux level while preserving the intrinsic SED shape. The best spectral and
integrated photometry model obtained for the BAGPIPES-exp fit is included. The
overall shape of the observed SEDs of mirrored clusters in both images are similar
within uncertainties, confirming the symmetry.
To check the consistency of the derived cluster physical properties, we test differ-
ent assumptions. The outputs are summarised in Extended Data Table 2 where we list
the median and 68% values produced by the different fits. Changing the attenuation
13prescription from Calzetti to SMC, produces noticeable smaller A v, but all the recov-
ered parameters are still within the 68% uncertanties associated with the recovered
values. In BAGPIPES- burst , we assumed a single burst. We recovered slightly older
ages and larger masses (but notice uncertanties) which would prefer higher stellar sur-
face densities and older dynamical ages, confirming that we are looking at dense and
bound star clusters. In a third SED fitting set, BAGPIPES- BPASS , we used BPASS
v2.2.1 SED templates [50] and the fiducial BPASS IMF with maximum stellar mass
of 300 M ⊙and a high-mass slope similar to [51]. Also, this model reproduces values
which are very close to the reference one, suggesting that the clusters are compati-
ble with being slightly older and therefore less sensitive to presence of very massive
stars/binary systems in their light (and the limitation of fitting only 6 broad/medium
band covering FUV-blue optical). Letting τ=free (we report mass-weighted param-
eters in Extended Data Table 2) produces significantly older ages, but similar masses,
thus not affecting the results presented in this article.
PROSPECTOR allows us to test single stellar population (SSP) SFH. In this
case, we find that the age of A.1 is slightly younger (but within uncertanties) than
those produced by the BAGPIPES , resulting in lower masses. This would result in
slightly lower intrinsic mass M ∗,int= 0.39×106M⊙, log(Σ ∗) = 4 .5 M⊙/pc2, and
log(Π) = 1 .2, but leaving unchanged any of the conclusions of the article.
Finally, given that some of the knots in the Cosmic Gems arc are unresolved (C.1
and B.2) or only marginally resolved (A.1) in our current images, we have also explored
scenarios in which these sources are individual, highly magnified stars. Using SED
models for stars at high redshifts [52] we find that, while the slopes of the SEDs of these
sources would be broadly consistent with individual stars at effective temperatures
≳20000 K, such scenarios would require magnifications well in excess of what our
macrolens models predict at the positions of these sources. Even the most massive and
luminous stars (initial mass 560–575 M⊙) described by the stellar evolutionary tracks
14of [53] would require magnifications µ >1000 to explain the observed fluxes of C.1,
B.2 or A.1.
Lens Models & uncertainties on the derived star cluster
physical properties
Four different lensing models have been created for the SPT-CL J0615 −5746 cosmo-
logical field. The models are presented in detail in [1]. We include here below a short
description.
Lenstool-A , here used as reference model for the analysis presented in this letter,
is based on the software LENSTOOL [54] which uses a parametric approach and MCMC
sampling of the parameter space to identify the best-fit model and uncertainties. In
Lenstool-A , we model the cluster lens as a combination of three main halos and clus-
ter member galaxies, all parameterized as pseudo-isothermal mass distributions. The
model uses as constraints the positions of 43 multiple images of 14 clumps, belong-
ing to 9 unique source galaxies. The redshifts of three sources are used as constraints
(thez= 10.2 arc, and sources at z= 1.358 and z= 4.013 [55]), while the rest of the
redshifts are treated as free parameters. Three clumps on each side of the main arc
were used as constraints, A, B, and C, assumed to be at z= 10.2. The model predicts
a counter image at (R.A., Decl.)=(93 .9490607, −57.7701814). A possible candidate of
this counter image, observed near this location ( ∼1.8′′), was not used as constraint.
The image plane rms of the best-fit model is 0 .36′′. All the observed lensed features
are well-reproduced by this model.
The second model, here referred to as Lenstool-B , uses the same algorithm, but
with noticeable different assumptions. This model uses 43 multiple images from 11
unique sources. A secondary cluster scale halo is placed around the location of dusty
galaxies nearly 50 arcsec north of the bright centre galaxy and allowed to move within
a 20′′box around this position. As with the previous model, the z= 10.2 arc has a
15predicted counter image near the possible candidate and is only about 2′′away from
theLenstool-A model. The main differences between those models are the assumptions
about the mass distribution of the lens and the addition of constraints. The image
plane rms of the best-fit model is 0.68′′.
The third model used in this analysis has been created with glafic . The glafic
[56, 57] mass model is constructed with three elliptical NFW [58] halos, external shear,
and cluster member galaxies modeled by pseudo-Jaffe profile. The model parameters
are fitted to reproduce the position of 44 multiple images generated from 15 back-
ground sources. Spectroscopic redshifts are available for 7 of the 15 sources. We include
positions of A.1/A.2 and B.1/B.2 in the Cosmic Gems arc as constraints, with small
positional errors of 0.04′′to accurately predict magnifications of each star cluster
images. For the other multiple images, we adopt the positional error of 0 .4′′. Our best-
fitting model reproduces all the multiple image positions with the root-mean-square
of image positions of 0 .41′′.
As a consistency check, we excluded the positional constraints from the Cosmic
Gems arc to construct the mass model, and confirmed that the critical curve of this
mass model still pass through the arc. Our glafic best-fitting mass model also pre-
dicts a counter-image of the Cosmic Gems arc at around (R.A., Dec.)=(93 .9504865,
−57.7696559). We find that there is a candidate counter-image at ∼2′′from the pre-
dicted position, (R.A., Dec.)=(93 .9500002, −57.7702197). Both the consistency check
and the presence of the candidate counter-image confirm the validity of this mass
model.
A fourth model has also been produced with WSLAP+ [59, 60]. The WSLAP+ lens mod-
els offer an alternative to parametric models and are free of assumptions made about
the distribution of dark matter. When the z= 10.2 arc is not included as a constraint,
theWSLAP+ model predicts the critical curve passing at ≈1′′from the z= 10.2 arc.
This solution predicts a mirrored image of the arc which is not observed, reinforcing
16the expectation that the Cosmic Gems is a double image with the critical curve pass-
ing through the middle. When the arc is included as a constraint, the predicted critical
curve passes between C.1 and D.1, just 0.3′′from the alleged symmetry point in the
arc, and within the uncertainties typical of WSLAP+ models. Also, this model predicts
the position of a third counterimage consistent with the previous models. This model
is currently under development with the goal of explaining the perturbation seen in
Img.2 , and is therefore not included in this analysis.
The photometric redshift of the candidate counter image is zphot =
10.8+0.6
−1.4(95% confidence) [1], in agreement with the expectation .
The total and tangential magnifications at the position of the star clusters, µtot=
µtang×µrad, are reported in Extended Data Table 3. For the two Lenstool -based
models, we estimated uncertainties following the method presented in [44] based on
magnification maps produced from the lenstool MCMC posterior distributions of the
lens model. Uncertainties are omitted for the glafic model.
In Extended Data Fig. 4, we show the impact that magnification predictions have
in the recovered physical properties (intrinsic half-light radius and mass, black and
blue solid lines) and derived quantities (dynamical age and stellar surface density in
magenta and orange solid lines). We use logarithmic scales so that all quantities can
be included. The colored bands show the level of uncertainties recovered from the
analysis. We also include the upper-limits on the R eff(assuming that the source is
unresolved and has size smaller than the stellar PSF) and what type of the lower-limits
it will translate for the physical quantities that depend on size estimates as dashed
lines (notice that these are the reference quantities for C.1 which is unresolved). The
magnifications (total in the bottom and tangential in the upper) are reported on the x
axis. As we move to lower magnifications, the derived masses and radii become larger,
consequently predicting lower stellar surface densities and dynamical ages. However,
even in the unlikely case that the magnifications are wrong by one order of magnitude,
17stellar surface density will remain above 104M⊙/pc2and dynamical ages will still be
significantly larger than 1 (log(Π) >0), leaving the main conclusion of this analysis
unchanged, i.e., that we are detecting bound proto-GCs within the first 500 Myr of
our Universe.

nation shows the rest-frame UV, blue optical wavelengths (1200–2800 ˚A). The arc is
extended over 5′′. A foreground galaxy at redshift zphot= 2.6 is visible above and to
the right. The field of view is rotated North up. Top right: A zoom inset of the center
of the arc where the brightest star clusters are located highlighted by the white square
on the left image. Two mirror images are observed due to gravitational lensing. Lens-
ing critical curves based on three models are shown bisecting the arc. Bottom left:
each star cluster is labeled in a grayscale FUV rest-frame image of the galaxy. Bottom
right: Source plane reconstruction of the core of the galaxy where the star clusters are
located showing their relative sizes and positions. The physical distance between A
and E and A and D is about 40 pc. Note there is some uncertainty in source positions
parallel to the lensing caustic.

log(Π=age/tcross)Fig. 2 :Cluster stellar surface density versus half-light radius R eff.The star
clusters in the zphot∼10.2 Cosmic Gems arc are shown color-coded by their dynamical
age, log(Π). The plotted values have been derived using the reference lensing model.
Predictions by other models do not change the observed trends. The error bars do
not account for magnification uncertainties. However, we refer the reader to Extended
Data Fig. 4, where we show that magnification uncertainties do not affect these results.
Other gravitationally-bound star clusters detected in lensed galaxies at z∼6 and
z= 2.38 are included, along with the z= 0 Milky Way globular clusters and young star
clusters properties of star-forming spiral galaxies in the Local Volume (distance <16
Mpc). Lines of equal mass show the change in density as a function of R eff.

Extended Data Figure 4 .Measured and derived cluster physical properties
as a function of their magnification. The most relevant quantities of each cluster
in the arc (marked in the central top panel) are expressed as a function of the total
magnification ( µtotaland in case of the R effas a function of µtan). The radii (R eff),
dynamical ages (Π), stellar mass surface densities (Σ mass) and the stellar masses (M ⋆)
suggest the clumps are bound star clusters even at modest magnification regimes
(µtotal>10). The transparent green region and the vertical lines show the expected
magnification from the reference lens model. The dotted horizontal line indicates the
region where log(Π) = 0. The shaded areas in the plot mark the uncertainties asso-
ciated with the derived values. The dashed lines show the lower-limits in Σ ∗and Π,
assuming half the stellar PSF FWHM as upper limit for the R effof each star cluster.
