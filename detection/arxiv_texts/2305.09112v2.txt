Abstract
Relative Fukaya categories are hard to construct. In this paper, we provide a very explicit con-
struction in the case of punctured surfaces.
The starting point is the gentle algebra Gtl Qassociated with a punctured surface Q. Our model
for the relative Fukaya category is a deformation Gtl qQwhich has one formal deformation parameter
per puncture. We verify that Gtl qQis a model for the relative Fukaya category by computing a large
part of the A∞-structure on the derived category H Tw Gtl qQ. The core method is the deformed
Kadeishvili theorem from [18].
The paper’s technical contributions include (1) a construction for removing curvature from band
objects, (2) a method for analyzing Kadeishvili trees, (3) a matching between deformed Kadeishvili
trees and relative Fukaya disks. This paper is the second in a series of three, whose aim it is to deform
mirror symmetry for punctured surfaces.

1 Introduction
Fukuya categories capture the global geometry of manifolds. They are complicated even to define and hard
to study. In the case of punctured surfaces, gentle algebras were introduced as a remedy by Bocklandt [9].
They have become a successful discrete version of the Fukaya category, having already served as A-side
in mirror symmetry [9] and as standard model to study homological properties and stability conditions
[16].
Smooth
Fukaya category Fuk Q←→[9] Discrete
Gentle algebra Gtl Q
On the smooth side, Seidel introduced in 2002 a procedure to deform Fukaya categories [23]. The result
is now known as the “relative Fukaya category” and has already been used e.g. as A-side in deformed
mirror symmetry for the n-punctured torus by Lekili-Perutz-Polishchuk [19, 20]. Surprisingly, a rigorous
construction of the relative Fukaya category was only finished in 2022 by Perutz and Sheridan [22].
On the discrete side, Bocklandt and the author recently proposed an analog of Seidel’s procedure in
[10]. Our analog consists of an explicit deformation of the gentle algebra. Ultimately, these “deformed
gentle algebras” will serve as A-side in our proof of deformed mirror symmetry for arbitrary punctured
surfaces.
In this paper, we prove that the smooth and discrete deformations are equivalent. More precisely, we
show that on the subcategories of zigzag curves, the smooth and discrete deformations have the same
A∞-structure:

Assembling deformed mirror symmetry
This paper is the second part in a series of three papers aimed at proving deformed noncommutative
mirror symmetry for punctured surfaces. The results of this paper seem to be interesting enough to stand
on their own, but their full value becomes visible when viewed in the context of the series. Here we recall
the overall aim of the series and the special relevance that this paper has to the workings of the series.
Mirror symmetry for punctured surfaces Original mirror symmetry of punctured surfaces due
to Bocklandt [9] considers as A-side the gentle algebra Gtl Qof a dimer Qand as B-side a category of
matrix factorizations mf(Jac ˇQ, ℓ) of the dual dimer ˇQ. Under the assumption that ˇQis zigzag consistent,
Bocklandt proves the existence of an A∞-quasi-isomorphism
GtlQ∼=mf(Jac ˇQ, ℓ).
This is known as noncommutative mirror symmetry for punctured surfaces. A natural question is which
deformation Gtl Qcorresponds to which deformation of mf(Jac ˇQℓ). We shall focus on one broad defor-
mation Gtl qQfrom the class of deformations defined in [10] and ask which deformation mf q(Jac ˇQ, ℓ) of
mf(Jac ˇQ, ℓ) corresponds to Gtl qQsuch that there is still a quasi-isomorphism of deformed A∞-categories
GtlqQ∼=mfq(Jac ˇQ, ℓ).
The Cho-Hong-Lau construction Proving mirror symmetry is inherently difficult because two cat-
egories only vaguely resembling each other need to be matched. More precisely, there exists typically no
strict A∞-isomorphism between the categories involved. To construct a non-strict functor as in [9] re-
quires one to recognize that two given A∞-structures are equal up to a kind of homotopy. The analogous
3question in case of deformations of A∞-categories is how to decide whether two given A∞-deformations
are gauge-equivalent. There are apparently very few tools available to decide this question.
The game changes as soon as we take the work of Cho, Hong and Lau [14] into account. They explain
how to construct a mirror equivalence for punctured surfaces by a version of Koszul duality. Their paper
shows how to systematically obtain both the dual dimer ˇQand Bocklandt’s mirror equivalence from a
systematic construction:
L⊆ C
A∞-category with subcategoryF:C → MF(Jac( QL, W), ℓ)
Mirror functor
The mirror category MF(Jac( QL, W), ℓ) is a category of matrix factorizations. The Jacobi algebra
Jac(QL, W) =CQL/(∂aW) and the potential ℓ∈Jac(QL, W) are determined by a kind of Koszul trans-
form of the A∞-structure on the subcategory L⊆ C. Mirror symmetry of punctured surfaces is a special
case of the Cho-Hong-Lau construction: We set C= H Tw Gtl Qand let H L⊆H Tw Gtl Qbe the sub-
category of zigzag paths ([14, Chapter 10]). This way, the Jacobi algebra Jac( QL, W) becomes the Jacobi
algebra Jac ˇQof the dual dimer and ℓbecomes the standard central element ℓ∈JacˇQ. The mirror
functor F: Gtl Q→MF(Jac ˇQ, ℓ) one obtains this way is an explicit incarnation of Bocklandt’s mirror
symmetry for punctured surfaces.
Deformed Cho-Hong-Lau construction We provide a deformed version of the Cho-Hong-Lau con-
struction. The starting point for the deformed construction is a given deformation CqofC. We denote
byLq⊆ Cqthe subcategory with the same objects as L. The result of our deformed Cho-Hong-Lau con-
struction is a functor of A∞-deformations Fq:Cq→MF(Jac( QL, Wq), ℓq). The deformed superpotential
Wqand potential ℓqare computed from the deformed A∞-structure on Lq.
Lq⊆ Cq
Deformed category with subcategoryFq:Cq→MF(Jac( QL, Wq), ℓq)
Deformed mirror functor
Application to deformed gentle algebras The strategy to obtain our deformed mirror functor for
GtlqQis to apply the deformed Cho-Hong-Lau construction to Gtl qQ. Starting form the category Gtl qQ
and following the definitions outlined in our auxiliary paper [18], we construct the twisted completion
Tw Gtl qQand its minimal model H Tw Gtl qQ. We apply the deformed Cho-Hong-Lau construction
to the subcategory of zigzag paths H Lq⊆H Tw Gtl qQ. The result is a functor of A∞-deformations
H Tw Gtl qQ→MF(Jac qˇQ, ℓq). By virtue of the deformed Cho-Hong-Lau construction, the deformed
Jacobi algebra Jac qˇQand the deformed potential ℓqare determined from the deformed A∞-structure on
HLq.

Deformed category of zigzag pathsFq: Gtl qQ→mf(Jac qˇQ, ℓq)
Deformed mirror functor
Assembly of the materials The assembly of the total package is divided into the three papers as
follows: In the first paper [10], we classify all deformations of Gtl Qup to gauge equivalence. In the
present second paper, we select one certain broad deformation Gtl qQof Gtl Q. This deformation induces
a deformation H Tw Gtl qQof the derived category H Tw Gtl Q. With the help of our auxiliary paper [18],
we calculate the deformed A∞-structure on the subcategory H Lq⊆H Tw Gtl qQgiven by zigzag paths.
In the third paper [11], we prove the deformed Cho-Hong-Lau construction. Simply plugging in the
description of H Lqfrom the present paper gives the desired mirror functor Fq: Gtl qQ→mf(Jac qˇQ, ℓq).
This result amounts to a wide range of deformed mirror equivalences for punctured surfaces.
Results
We present here the results of this paper in a non-technical manner. The precise statements can be found
in Theorem 5.14, 9.26 and 9.31.
4Uncurving of band objects The objects of the derived category H Tw Gtl Qhave been classified up to
isomorphism in [16]. They fall into two classes: the string objects and the band objects. Geometrically,
a string corresponds to a curve γ: [0,1]→ |Q|which starts and ends at punctures. A band object
corresponds to a closed curve γ:S1→ |Q|which does not hit any punctures. Both string objects
and band objects can also be interpreted as objects in the deformed twisted completion Tw Gtl qQ. In
Theorem 5.14, we show that for the typical band object this curvature can be gauged away.
Analysis of deformed Kadeishvili trees We explicitly describe the minimal model H Lq⊆H Tw Gtl qQ
in terms of immersed disks. Our strategy is to compute the minimal deformed A∞-structure on H Lq⊆
H Tw Gtl qQby means of the deformed Kadeishvili theorem from [18]. The deformed Kadeishvili theo-
rem instructs us to choose a homological splitting for L, gauge away the curvature of Lqand perform an
infinitesimal “change of basis” on the homological splitting. After this procedure, the A∞-structure of
HLqis described in terms of Kadeishvili trees. In the present paper, we analyze all these trees in detail.
Minimal model of the deformed category of zigzag paths We succeed in describing the minimal
model H Lq⊆H Tw Gtl qQin terms of immersed disks. Our strategy is to match all result components
of Kadeishvili trees with immersed disks. We find four types of immersed disks, the CR, ID, DS and
DW disks. The precise description is stated in Theorem 9.26. Once we restrict to the transversal part of
HLq, the description reduces to the smooth immersed disks used for the definition of the relative Fukaya
category. Explicitly, the transversal part of H Lqagrees with the subcategory of relFukpreQgiven by
zigzag curves.
The minimal model calculation
The main storyline of this paper is the calculation of the minimal model H Lqby means of our deformed
Kadeishvili theorem from [18]. We review here a special case of the deformed Kadeishvili construction, in
which the construction reduces to three steps. We describe how each of the three steps plays out during
the specific calculation of H Lq. This description covers the materials contained in section 6 till 9.
The deformed Kadeishvili theorem [18] The classical Kadeishvili theorem states that every A∞-
category has a minimal model. By definition, a minimal model of an A∞-category Cis any A∞-category
HCwith vanishing differential µ1
HCsuch that Cand H Care quasi-isomorphic. When Cqis an (infinitesi-
mally curved) deformation of C, it is not clear a priori what a minimal model should be and whether it
exists. In our auxiliary paper [18], we fix a definition of minimal models for deformed A∞-categories and
show that every deformed A∞-category Cqhas a minimal model. We also provide a deformed Kadeishvili
construction to compute a minimal model H Cqexplicitly.
In the present paper, we apply the deformed Kadeishvili construction in order to compute the minimal
model H Tw Gtl qQ. For section 6 till 9, a simplified version of our deformed Kadeishvili construction
suffices. This simplified version starts from the datum of a homological splitting H⊕I⊕RforCand
the assumption that Cqhas vanishing curvature and satisfies a technical condition with respect to the
homological splitting. In this case, the minimal model H Cqcan be computed as follows:
1. Perform an infinitesimal change on the homological splitting in order to adapt it to µ1
q.
2. Calculate the deformed codifferential hqand projection πq.
3. Define the structure of H Cqby sums over deformed Kadeishvili trees.
Gauging away curvature of LqBefore we can apply the deformed Kadeishvili construction to Lq, we
have to gauge away the curvature of Lq. The gauge consists of applying our “complementary angle trick”
which we define and treat in the larger generality of band objects. The idea is that the twisted complexes
contained in Lqconsist of sums of arcs, with twisted differential given by angles between those arcs.
Every angle comes with a certain complementary angle. Our “complementary angle trick” consists of
adding the complements of these angles, weighted by deformation parameters, to the twisted differential.
This trick succeeds at removing the curvature of Lq.
Choice of homological splitting As a preparatory step for the deformed Kadeishvili construction,
we are supposed to choose a homological splitting H⊕I⊕RforL. There are many possible homological
splittings, but not all make sense from a geometric point of view. In section 6, we choose one specific
homological splitting. To define our splitting, we have to choose an explicit basis for the cohomology of
5every hom spaces in L. Since we expect to obtain the relative Fukaya category as minimal model, we
choose cohomology basis elements which are geometrically located as close as possible to the intersection
points of the zigzag curves.
Step 1 For the first step of the Kadeishvili construction, we are supposed to calculate the infinitesimal
base change. It requires from us that we evaluate the deformed differential µ1
Lq. In section 7, we execute
this by investigating all possible contributions to products µ1
Lq(ε) =µ1
q(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ). We introduce the
notions of “E, F, G, H disks” and “tails” as bookkeeping tool to systematically construct the required
infinitesimal base change.
Already at the present stage after the first step, we have a strong indication that we will obtain the
relative Fukaya category as result of the calculation. Take for granted that the basis elements of Hcan
be identified with intersection points of zigzag curves. The infinitesimal base change of the first step adds
infinitesimal amounts of Rto the cohomology basis elements in H. Visually, the interpretation is that
the intersection points “grow tails” in all directions where they could possibly bound disks. This is a
strong indication that we will obtain the relative Fukaya category as a result.
Step 2 For the second step, we are supposed to calculate the deformed codifferential hqand deformed
projection πq. In section 7.5, we calculate the deformed codifferential hq(ε) and πq(ε) for the most
important morphisms εbetween zigzag paths. This requires a detailed analysis of the surroundings of ε,
which we capture in terms of what we call situations of type A, B, C and D. It turns out also hq(ε) comes
with an infinitesimal “tail” pointing in all possible directions that can bound disks with ε. We end up
with expressions for the deformed codifferential of any morphism.
Very specifically, the reader will see recurrent use of the codifferential expression hq(βα) throughout
the paper. In this context, the morphism βalways denotes a β-angle associated with a “type A situation”.
The analysis shows that β-angles act as extending link between multiple portions of a relative Fukaya
disk, which renders them the most powerful angles in this paper.
Step 3 For the third step, we have to evaluate deformed Kadeishvili trees. In section 8, we start with
a careful characterization of all results that can possibly come out of the Kadeishvili trees. The simplest
Kadeishvili trees can of course be translated into relative Fukaya disks directly. Results of all other
Kadeishvili trees are instead results of iterated applications of the deformed product µqof Gtl q. We
introduce “result components” as a bookkeeping tool for evaluating Kadeishvili trees and provide a full
characterization of how result components are derived from each other within a Kadeishvili tree.
Interpretation of the result In section 9, we show how to turn result components of Kadeishvili
trees into disks by an explicit method. Due to our characterization, every result component comes with a
history, a way in which it was derived from simpler result components. We devise an inductive procedure
to draw a disk from a result component. The type of the outcome is not exactly the same as a relative
Fukaya disk, but is what we call an SL disk (shapeless disk). The drawing procedure works as follows:
Departing from the leaves of the Kadeishvili tree, we start drawing a small portion of the SL disk. As
multiple result components are merged into one at any node in the tree, we glue together their small
portions. When we reach the root of the tree, we conclude the drawing by closing the SL disk with an
output mark. All in all, we have assigned this way an SL disk to a result component.

As a final step, we classify all SL disks we have obtained this way. It turns out that the SL disks
obtained are of four types, which we call CR, ID, DS and DW disks. In other words, the higher products
on HLqare precisely computed by SL disks in the surface that belong to one of those four types. It is
useful to know in advance that many, but not all of these disks are transversal. In fact, the transversal
6ones among them are all of CR type and match exactly the (transversal) relative Fukaya disks. This
finishes the computation of the minimal model H Lq.
Context and philosophical highlights
The results of our paper are very specific. To get a sense of their general meaning, we put the results
into context. We comment on the following philosophical highlights:
•All deformed A∞-categories have derived categories.
•Computational techniques carry over to the deformed case.
•Minimal model calculations are possible if one is sensitive to the result.
•The deformed gentle algebra Gtl qQis a relative wrapped Fukaya category.
•Hamiltonian deformations arise naturally from representation theory.
Derived categories of A∞-deformations In formal A∞-deformation theory, one regards infinitesimal
deformations of a given A∞-structure such that the A∞-relations are preserved. As we review in [18], one
needs to permit the deformations to have curvature in order to obtain a homologically invariant notion
of deformations. More precisely, one allows infinitesimal curvature in the sense that it lies in a multiple
of the maximal ideal of the local ring.
Dealing with curvature is often regarded as tedious, because the curvature prevents the differential
from squaring to zero. The presence of curvature is often referred to as the “curvature problem”. A main
question is how to gauge away the curvature or otherwise how to deal with the remaining curvature.
An instance of the uncurving problem has been studied by Lowen and Van den Bergh [21], on which we
comment in section F.1.5.
Part of the “curvature problem” is that curved A∞-categories do not have derived categories since
their differential does not square to zero. In [18], we show that the game changes when the curvature is
only infinitesimal. We define a twisted completion Tw Cqand minimal model H Cqfor any A∞-deformation
Cq. The derived category of Cqcan then be written as H Tw Cq. It is a deformation of H Tw C.
Minimal model techniques Minimal models of A∞-deformations are defined abstractly by inducing
the deformation afterwards. More precisely, let Cbe an A∞-category and Cqa deformation. Let H Cbe a
minimal model for Cwith quasi-isomorphism π:C → HC. In [18] we define the minimal model H Cqto be
the deformation of H Cinduced from Cqviaπ. This abstract approach means that the “minimal model”
HCqmay have infinitesimal curvature as well as a residual infinitesimal differential. This is not the same
as taking cohomology of the hom complexes (Hom Cq(X, Y), µ1
q). In fact, the deformed differential of an
A∞-deformation need not even square to zero because of the curvature.
Minimal models of A∞-categories can classically be computed by means of homological splittings
and Kadeishvili trees. In our deformed Kadeishvili theorem, we show that this method carries over
to the deformed case. The starting point is an A∞-category together with an deformation Cq. The
difficulties encountered in constructing the minimal model are the presence of curvature µ0
q, the fact that
the deformed differential µ1
qdoes not square to zero and the fact that µ1
qis not compatible with the
homological splitting chosen for C. In section 2.3, we review how to adapt the Kadeishvili construction to
these special circumstances. We view our deformed Kadeishvili theorem as evidence that computational
techniques which apply to A∞-deformations can be tweaked in order to apply to A∞-deformations as
well.
Discrete relative Fukaya category Many different constructions of Fukaya categories are available
in the literature. The most general approach is the reference work of Seidel [24]. For relative Fukaya
categories, a new reference is the construction of Sheridan and Perutz [22]. For the case of punctured
surfaces, there are many further specific models available. One can distinguish whether they depart from
the discrete side of gentle algebras or from the smooth side of actual Fukaya categories, and whether they
consider the punctured surface alone or whether they consider Seidel’s deformation. The following is a
non-exhaustive overview:
starting point non-deformed deformed
geometric [9, Appendix B] [23], [19], [20]
discrete [9], [7], [16] this paper
7The most important reference for us is the construction of the gentle algebras of [9]. In [10], we
proposed a candidate deformation Gtl qQwith the intention to provide a “relative wrapped Fukaya
category” for punctured surfaces. Verifying that the deformed gentle algebra Gtl qQdeserves this name
would at least entail proving that the transversal part of its derived category is equivalent to the relative
Fukaya category, see section F.2.2. It is however quite difficult to actually compute the derived category,
as we witness in the present paper. If a “relative wrapped Fukaya category” existed already, this would
be greatly eased, see section F.2.3.
In the present paper, we succeed in showing that at least on the subcategory of zigzag paths, the
derived category H Tw Gtl qQand the relative Fukaya category relFuk Qagree. Although our calculation
is limited to zigzag paths, we consider our calculation strong evidence that H Tw Gtl qQindeed contains
relFuk Q. It is a crude verification that we have correctly transported Seidel’s vision to gentle algebras
and that Gtl qQcan be considered a relative wrapped Fukaya category.
Minimal model calculations A highlight in this paper is our explicit computation of an entire min-
imal model. Such computations are scarce in the A∞-literature and often considered tedious. Indeed,
minimal model calculations are hard because of the large amount of Kadeishvili trees involved. For some
calculations in the liturature, it is not necessary to perfom the calculation until the end. In the case of [9]
it suffices to calculate only part of the minimal model because the rest is determined up to homotopy. In
the case of [10], we also cut short the calculation of an L∞-minimal model by means of grading arguments.
In the present paper, we perform the minimal model calculation of Lquntil the end.
Minimal model calculations are the core connecting bridge between the discrete and the smooth world.
They are regarded as tedious, but we contend that minimal model calculation need not hurt if one has
a clue regarding the outcome. The minimal model calculation in the present paper succeeds precisely
because we recognize in every step the inherent geometric meaning of the terms that appear. This
concerns both the choice of the homological splitting for Land the evaluation of the Kadeishvili trees.
In section F.3 and F.4.4, we offer further explanation on why our method of “result components” works
and how to apply it in other situations.
Hamiltonian deformations Implementing Hamiltonian deformations is one of the difficulties one
encounters when defining smooth Fukaya categories. In the discrete world, one circumvents this problem
by choosing such a small set of generators that the Hamiltonian deformations can be chosen canonically
and disappear completely from the picture. When passing to the derived category H Tw Gtl Q, we however
expect the full generality of the smooth Fukaya category to reappear. In particular, we expect to find
A∞-products on some non-transversal and expect that we can explain these products as an incarnation
of Hamiltonian deformation.
In the present paper, we compute the precise A∞-products on the deformed category H Lq. The start-
ing point is our deformed Kadeishvili theorem, whose essential ingredient is a choice of homological split-
ting for L. As expected, the products of H Lqagree with the products of the relative Fukaya category on
transversal sequences. We however also obtain an explicit description of the products on non-transversal
sequences. We show how to interpret even the products on non-transversal sequences geometrically as
disks being bounded by zigzag curves and their Hamiltonian deformations. While Hamiltonian deforma-
tions have to be incorporated as an ingredient into the definition of smooth Fukaya categories from the
beginning, they appear naturally through the Kadeishvili construction of the minimal model H Lq.
The precise shape of the products of H Lqdepends on the choice of homological splitting for L. Never-
theless, different homological splittings give quasi-equivalent minimal models H Lq. We have selected one
specific splitting which makes it particularly easy to identify the minimal model as the relative Fukaya
category. When choosing a slightly different splitting, we still expect to obtain the same products on
transversal sequences, but the products on non-transversal sequences will typically change. These changed
products can be interpreted geometrically as products in the relative Fukaya category under application of
a different Hamiltonian deformation. While homological splittings for Lare a discrete and representation-
theoretic notion, Hamiltonian deformations are a smooth and geometric notion. Highly simplified, we
may say that choices of homological splittings correspond to choices of Hamiltonian deformations. See
also section F.3.2.
Strings and bands Gentle algebras Gtl Qwere originally introduced in [9] to provide a combinatorial
description of the wrapped Fukaya category of the punctured surface |Q| \Q0. In contrast to the Fukaya
category of |Q|\Q0, the wrapped Fukaya category also includes curves which start and end at punctures.
Haiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich [16] classified the objects of H Tw Gtl Qunder the additional datum
of aZ-grading. Their classification indeed finds those types of curves expected from the wrapped Fukaya
8category. Explictly, their classification divides the objects into two classes, known as string objects and
band objects. Roughly speaking, a string object is a non-closed curve running between two punctures of
Qand a band object is a closed curve that avoids the punctures of Q.
A string object or band object given by a curve in |Q|can be explicitly realized as a twisted complex
in Tw Gtl Q. The procedure entails approximating the curve by arcs a1, . . . , a kofQtogether with angles
αibetween the arcs. One then forms a twisted complex (L
iai[si], δ=P
iαi) by summing up the arcs
and using the angles as twisted differential.
Seidel [23] describes which objects in the relative Fukaya category should have curvature according
to his vision. For the case of punctured surfaces, his criterion states that curves which bound a so-called
teardrop should have curvature. Also those curves which are contractible in the surface |Q|should have
curvature. All other objects in the relative Fukaya category should be curvature-free according to Seidel.
In the present paper, we approach Seidel’s vision from the starting point of the deformed gen-
tle algebras Gtl qQinstead of the relative Fukaya category. Translated to our setting, a band object
(L
iai[si], δ=P
iαi) should be uncurvable if its underlying curve in the closed surface |Q|is not con-
tractible and does not bound a teardrop. In order to make his vision true, we devise a trick to gauge
away the curvature of these band objects. Our “complementary angle trick” consists essentially of adding
infinitesimal multiples of the complementary angle of αitoδfor all i. In section 5, we verify that our trick
successfully uncurves all band objects whose underlying curve in the closed surface |Q|is not contractible
and does not bound a teardrop, making true Seidel’s vision.
Data structures
Most of our calculation does not go beyond simple inspection of arc systems and linear algebra. However,
organizing result components and matching them with disks requires us to devise a large amount of data
structures and fill them with data. For an overview, we depict in Figure 1.1 the essential data structures.
We shall here explain the purpose and development of these datastructures and which data flows from
which structure into which one.
The starting point is a dimer Q, which is a specific type of quiver embedded in a surface. It gives rise
to the discrete notion of zigzag paths and the smooth notion of zigzag curves. On the smooth side, the
zigzag curves give rise to the notion of intersection points and smooth immersed disks, the foundations
of Fukaya categories.
On the discrete side, we regard the category Lof zigzag paths. A morphism ε:L1→L2between two
zigzag paths consists of an angle between arcs of L1andL2. We determine a basis of cohomology elements
forL. We also define the category Lqof deformed zigzag paths. Examining the deformed differential
µ1
Lqof this category gives rise to four types of disks which we call E, F, G, H disks. We introduce the
auxiliary notion of “tails”. The tail of an angle ε:L1→L2is a tree whose nodes are decorated with E,
F, G, H disks.
The deformed Kadeishvili theorem gives rise to notions of deformed cohomology basis elements, a
deformed projection πqand a deformed codifferential hq. We can describe them explicitly by means of
tails. According to the deformed Kadeishvili theorem, the product structure of the minimal model H Lq
is described in terms of sums over trees. We define a notion of “result components” which serves to
systematically track the results of evaluations of trees. From a result component we build a “subdisk”
by drawing zigzag curve segments and intersection points. Subdisks of result components are immersed
disks and fall into four classes which we call the CR, DS, ID and DW disks.
From the perspective of data structures, this finishes the construction of the minimal model H Lq.
Both H Lqand the relative Fukaya category are described by immersed disks. Therefore the category Lq
of deformed zigzag paths is quasi-isomorphic to the subcategory of zigzag curves of the relative Fukaya
category. On the level of data structures, this finishes the main theorem.
Structure of the paper
In section 2 we recall A∞-categories, their deformations and our deformed Kadeishvili theorem. In
section 3, we recall gentle algebras and deformed gentle algebras. In section 4, we recall basics of Fukaya
categories and explain their subcatgories of zigzag curves. In section 5 we present the uncurving procedure
for band objects. In section 6, we exhibit the category of zigzag paths Ltogether with a homological
splitting. In section 7, we present the deformed version of this homological splitting, together with
reference material for the rest of the paper. In section 8, we introduce the tool of result components
to enumerate products in the minimal model H Lq. In section 9, we devise a simple drawing method
to transform these result components into immersed disks. In Theorem 9.26, we describe explicitly the

depicts data structures used for the computation of the minimal model H Lq. The right part depicts the
construction of the Fukaya category. At the end of the paper, the minimal model H Lqis described by
means of immersed disks. The relative Fukaya category is defined in terms of immersed disks as well.
Ultimately, we conclude that H Lqis equivalent to the subcategory of the relative Fukaya category given
by zigzag curves.
10structure of the minimal model H Lqin terms of immersed disks. Our main result Theorem 9.31 states
that H Lqhas the same products on transversal sequences as the relative Fukaya category.
This paper contains several appendices which are devoted to technical proofs and additional expla-
nation. In Appendix A, we provide examples of immersed disks together with their corresponding result
components. The aim is to facilitate understanding of how disks arise from the minimal model H Lq. In
Appendix B, we complete the proof of uncurvability of band objects. In Appendix C, we finish the proof
of the main result by providing an explicit inverse construction which maps CR, DS, ID and DS disks
to their corresponding result components. In Appendix D, we study the case of specific sphere dimers,
among which the pair of pants. These dimers are not geometrically consistent and fall outside of the
scope of the rest of the paper, but we have included their calculation due to their relevance in mirror
symmetry. In Appendix E, we compute a small class of products in the category H Tw Gtl qQwhich go
beyond zigzag paths. Specifically, this concerns products of morphisms between arcs and zigzag paths
from which we determine the mirror objects Fq(a)∈MF(Jac qˇQ, ℓq) in the third paper. In section F.1,
we discuss the relation with the literature in more detail. In section F.2, we explain why one is led to
believe from an a priori perspective that H Lqagrees with the relative Fukaya category. In section F.3,
we summarize from an a posteriori perspective why the very technical calculation of H Lqcontained in
this paper succeeds. In section F.4, we share insight on how to reuse the constructions in this paper for
other purposes. In Appendix G, we collect notation specific to this paper.
Conventions
During the course of the paper, we play in two different contexts. In section 5, the starting point is an
arc system Awhich has no monogons or digons in the closed surface. We summarize this in the [NMDC]
condition. In section 6 till 9, the starting point is a geometrically consistent dimer Q. Every zigzag path
is supposed to come with a chosen spin structure and locations of identity and co-identity endomorphism.
We summarize this setup in Convention 6.10.

2 Preliminaries on A∞-categories
In this section, we recollect background material on A∞-categories and fix notation. In section 2.1,
we recall A∞-categories, their functors, twisted completion and minimal models. In section 2.2, we
recall completed tensor products, deformations of A∞-categories and their functors. We very briefly
comment on the construction of twisted completion and minimal model for A∞-deformations from [18].
In section 2.3, we recall our deformed Kadeishvili theorem.
2.1 A∞-categories
In this section we recall A∞-categories, their twisted completion and functors. The material is standard
and can for instance be found in [7]. Throughout we work over an algebraically closed field of characteristic
zero and write C.
Definition 2.1. A (Z- orZ/2Z-graded, strictly unital) A∞-category Cconsists of a collection of
objects together with Z- orZ/2Z-graded hom spaces Hom( X, Y), distinguished identity morphisms
idX∈Hom0(X, X ) for all X∈ C, together with multilinear higher products
µk: Hom( Xk, Xk+1)⊗. . .⊗Hom( X1, X2)→Hom( X1, Xk+1), k≥1
of degree 2 −ksuch that the A∞-relations and strict unitality axioms hold: For every compatible

µ2(a,idX) =a, µ2(idY, a) = (−1)|a|a, µ≥3(. . . ,idX, . . .) = 0 .
Next we recall the additive completion Add Cof an A∞-category C. This category consists of formal
sums of shifted objects. The hom space between two objects consists of matrices of morphisms between
the summands.
Definition 2.2. LetCbe an A∞category with product µC. The additive completion Add CofCis the
category of formal sums of shifted objects of C:
A1[k1]⊕. . .⊕An[kn].
The hom space between two such objects X=LAi[ki] and Y=LBi[mi] is
Hom AddC(X, Y) =M
i,jHomC(Ai, Bj)[mj−ki].

Here each ailies in some Hom( Xi[ki], Xi+1[ki+1]). The integer lidenotes the difference ki+1−kibetween
the shifts and the degree ∥ai∥is the degree of aias element of Hom C(Xi, Xi+1).
Next we recall the twisted completion Tw Cof an A∞-category C. The objects of this category are
virtual chain complexes of objects of C:
Definition 2.3. Atwisted complex inCis an object X∈AddCtogether with a morphism δ∈
Hom1
AddC(X, X ) of degree 1 such that δis strictly upper triangular and satisfies the Maurer-Cartan
equation:
MC(δ):=µ1(δ) +µ2(δ, δ) +. . .= 0.
We may refer to the morphism δas the twisted differential . Note that the upper triangularity ensures
that this sum is well-defined. The twisted completion ofCis the A∞-category Tw Cwhose objects are
twisted complexes. Its hom spaces are the same as for the additive completion:
Hom TwC(X, Y) = Hom AddC(X, Y).

n0).
A functor between two A∞-categories is a mapping which matches the products of the two categories:
Definition 2.4. LetCandDbeA∞-categories. Then a functor F:C → D ofA∞-categories consists
of a map F: Ob(C)→Ob(D) together with for every k≥1 a degree 1 −kmultilinear map
Fk: Hom C(Xk, Xk+1)⊗. . .⊗HomC(X1, X2)→HomC(FX1, FX k+1)
such that the A∞-functor relations hold:
X

The functor Fis an isomorphism ifF: Ob(C)→Ob(D) is a bijection and F1: Hom C(X, Y)→
HomD(FX, FY ) is an isomorphism for all X, Y∈ C. The functor Fis aquasi-isomorphism ifF:
Ob(C)→Ob(D) is a bijection and F1: Hom C(X, Y)→HomD(FX, FY ) is a quasi-isomorphism of
complexes for every X, Y∈ C.
12Definition 2.5. When F:C → D andG:D → E areA∞-functors, then their composition is given by
GF: Ob(C)→Ob(E) on objects and
(GF)(ak, . . . , a 1) =X
G(F(ak, . . .), . . . , F (. . . , a 1)).
Let us recall minimal models and their notation as follows:
Definition 2.6. AnA∞-category Cisminimal ifµ1
C= 0. A minimal model ofCis any minimal
A∞-category Dtogether with a quasi-isomorphism F:D → C . A minimal model of Cis generically
denoted H C.
By the famous Kadeishvili theorem, every A∞-category has a minimal model. In fact, a minimal
model can be constructed semi-explicitly by sums over trees.
2.2 Deformations of A∞-categories
In this section, we recall deformations of A∞-categories. We follow [18] where also more detail can be
found. We start by recalling completed tensor products. Then we recall A∞-deformations and their
functors. We comment very briefly on the construction of the twisted completion and minimal models
forA∞-deformations from [18].
We recall now completed tensor products Bb⊗Xwith Ba local ring and Xa vector space. The letter
Bwill always denote a local ring with extra properties. We have decided to give this a name:
Definition 2.7. Adeformation base is a complete local Noetherian unital C-algebra Bwith residue
fieldB/m=C. The maximal ideal is always denoted m.
Remark 2.8. By the Cohen structure theorem, every deformation base is of the form CJx1, . . . , x nK/I
with Idenoting some ideal.
IfXis a vector spaces, then Bb⊗X= lim( B/mk⊗X) denotes the completed tensor product over C.
For simplicity, we write mkXto denote the infinitesimal part mkX=mkb⊗X⊆Bb⊗X. Recall that Bb⊗X
is aB-module and comes with the m-adic topology, which turns Bb⊗Xinto a sequential Hausdorff space.
For convenience, we may from time to time use expressions like x=O(mk) to indicate x∈mkX.
Definition 2.9. A map φ:Bb⊗X→Bb⊗Yiscontinuous if it is continuous with respect to the m-adic
topologies. A map φ: (Bb⊗Xk)⊗. . .⊗(Bb⊗X1)→Bb⊗Yiscontinuous if for every 1 ≤i≤kand every
sequence of elements x1, . . . , ˆxi, . . . , x kthe map
µ(xk, . . . ,−, . . . , x 1) :Bb⊗Xi→Bb⊗Y
is continuous.
Remark 2.10. Every element in Bb⊗Xcan be written as a seriesP∞
i=0mixi. Here miis a sequence of
elements mi∈m→∞andxiis a sequence of elements xi∈X. We have used the notation mi∈m→∞to
indicate that mi∈mkifor some sequence ( ki)⊆Nwith ki→ ∞ .
Remark 2.11. Every B-linear map Bb⊗X→Bb⊗Yis automatically continuous (see [18] for the argu-
ment), so is every every B-multilinear map ( Bb⊗Xk)⊗. . .⊗(Bb⊗X1)→Bb⊗Y. Linear maps X→Bb⊗Y
can be uniquely extended to B-linear maps Bb⊗X→Bb⊗Yand multilinear maps Xk⊗. . .⊗X1→Bb⊗Y
can be uniquely extended to B-multilinear maps ( Bb⊗Xk)⊗. . .⊗(Bb⊗X1)→Bb⊗Y(see [18]).
Remark 2.12. Theleading term of aB-linear map φ:Bb⊗X→Bb⊗Yis the map φ0:X→Ygiven
by the composition φ0=πφ|X, where π:Bb⊗Y→Ydenotes the standard projection. If the leading
term φ0is injective or surjective, then φis injective or surjective itself (see [18] for the argument).
We recall now A∞-deformations. When Cis an A∞-category, the idea is to model its A∞-deformations
on the collection of enlarged hom spaces {Bb⊗HomC(X, Y)}X,Y∈C. Any B-multilinear product on these
hom spaces is automatically continuous. Similarly, functors of A∞-deformations will be defined as maps
between tensor products of the enlarged hom spaces and will be automatically continuous as well.
A∞-deformations of Cwill always be allowed to have infinitesimal curvature. The reason is that only
this way we get a homologically sensible notion: Whenever µqis an (infinitesimally) curved deformation,
then ν=µ−µqis a Maurer-Cartan element of the Hochschild DGLA HC( C). We comment on this in
more detail in [18].
13Definition 2.13. LetCbe an A∞category with products µandBa deformation base. An A∞-
deformation ofCqofCconsists of
•The same objects as C,
•Hom spaces Hom Cq(X, Y) =Bb⊗HomC(X, Y) for X, Y∈ C,
•B-multilinear products of degree 2 −k

q(a,idX) =a, µ2
q(idY, a) = (−1)|a|a, µ≥3
q(. . . ,idX, . . .) = 0 .
We are now ready to explain the natural extension of A∞-functors to the deformed case.
Definition 2.14. LetC,Dbe two A∞-categories and Cq,Dqdeformations. A functor of deformed
A∞-categories consists of a map Fq: Ob(C)→Ob(D) together with for every k≥1 aB-multilinear
degree 1 −kmap

q(idX) = id FqXfor every X∈ Cand
F≥2
q(. . . ,idX, . . .) = 0.
Remark 2.15. Note that the functor Fqitself is allowed to have a curvature component. The first two

IfFq:Cq→ D qis a functor of A∞-deformations, then its leading term F:C → D is automatically a
functor of A∞-categories.
Definition 2.16. LetFq:Cq→ D qbe a functor of A∞-deformations. Then Fqis aquasi-isomorphism
if its leading term F:C → D is a quasi-isomorphism of A∞-categories.
Uncurving refers to the process of removing curvature from a deformation Cqby means of gauging.
More precisely, uncurving refers to finding a functor Fq:C′
q→ C qwhere C′
qis another deformation of C
with possibly less curvature and the functor Fqis the identity when dividing out the maximal ideal mof
the deformation base. For instance, one may regard the uncurving C′
qofCqby an element r={rX}X∈C
consisting of rX∈mEnd1

Definition 2.17. LetCbe an A∞category and Cqa deformation. Let X∈ C. Then Xisuncurvable
if there exists an rX∈mEnd1(X) such that
µ0
X+µ1
Cq(rX) +µ2
Cq(rX, rX) +. . .= 0.
Remark 2.18. In [18] we explain that uncurvability of objects is invariant under quasi-isomorphism.
More precisely, if X, Y∈ Care quasi-isomorphic and Xis uncurvable in Cq, then also Yis uncurvable
inCq. We also show that functors of A∞-deformations send uncurvable objects to uncurvable objects.
More precisely, if Fq:Cq→ D qis a functor of A∞-deformations and X∈ Cis uncurvable, then Fq(X) is
uncurvable.
We recall in Definition 2.19 that a deformation Cqhas a twisted completion Tw Cq. This category
TwCqis a deformation of Tw C. Its objects are defined in terms of twisted differentials as well, but the
twisted differentials do not satisfy the Maurer-Cartan equation with respect to the deformed product
µCq. Instead, the failure to satisfy the Maurer-Cartan equation is captured in the object’s curvature. We
recall the definition from [18] as follows:
Definition 2.19. LetCbe an A∞category with products µCandCqa deformation with products µCq.
Then the twisted completion TwCqis the (possibly curved) deformation of Tw Cgiven by the deformed
products
µk
TwCq(αk, . . . , α 1) =X
n0,...,n k≥0µAddCq(δ, . . . , δ|{z}
nk, αk, . . . , α 1, δ, . . . , δ|{z}
n0).
Remark 2.20. It is possible to define a variant Tw′Cqof the twisted completion of A∞-deformations by
allowing additional infinitesimal entries anywhere in the δ-matrix. The objects of Tw′Cqshall be pairs
(X, δ=δ0+δ′), X∈AddC, δ 0∈Hom1
C(X, X ), δ′∈mHom1
C(X, X ).
Here we require only the leading part δ0to be upper triangular and satisfy the Maurer-Cartan equation
with respect to µC. The infinitesimal part δ′can also lie below the diagonal. The category Tw′Cqis
strictly speaking not a deformation of Tw Cqsince it has more objects. For more insight, we refer to [18].
Minimal models ofA∞-deformations exist and we review this topic in section 2.3.
2.3 The deformed Kadeishvili theorem
In this section we recall the classical Kadeishvili construction and a special case of our deformed Kadeishvili
construction from [18]. The starting point is an A∞-deformation Cqof an A∞-category C. Due to cur-
vature and the failure of the differential to square to zero, it is initially unclear how to define the notion
of minimal models and how to construct a minimal model for the given deformation Cqexplicitly. In the
present section, we review our definition and construction from [18]:
A∞-deformation Cq Minimal model H Cq
We do not attempt to review the deformed Kadeishvili construction in its full generality. Rather we
focus on the special case where the curvature vanishes and an additional condition “ D= 0” holds. In
this case, the construction simplifies substantially. For the purposes of section 7 until 9, this special case
suffices. For the purposes of Appendix D, the special case is insufficient and we have to refer to [18] for
documentation of the general case.
We start by reviewing the definition of minimal models for A∞-deformations from [18]:
Definition 2.21. LetCbe an A∞-category, Cqa deformation of C, and H Ca minimal model for C. Then
aminimal model HCqofCqis any A∞-deformation of H Csuch that there exists a quasi-isomorphism
Fq: HCq→ C q.
Remark 2.22. As we explain in [18], every A∞-deformation has a minimal model. While a minimal
model H Cqis a deformation of H C, its differential and curvature need not vanish. Instead, H Cqcarries
an infinitesimal residue differential and curvature.
15Our second step is to recall the notion of homological splittings:
Definition 2.23. LetCbe an A∞-category. Then a homological splitting ofCconsists of a direct
sum decomposition
HomC(X, Y) =H(X, Y)⊕I(X, Y)⊕R(X, Y),∀X, Y∈ C
for all its hom spaces, such that
I(X, Y) = Im( µ1),Ker(µ1) =H(X, Y)⊕I(X, Y),∀X, Y∈ C.
We frequently denote a homological splitting of Csimply by the letters H⊕I⊕R, the dependence on
X, Y∈ Cunderstood implicitly.
Given a category C, one obtains a homological splitting by choosing Has a space of cocycles that
represents the cohomology of the hom complexes. One then chooses Ras a complement to Hin Ker( µ1).
The notation Iis simply a shorthand for the image of the differential. In terms of the direct sum
decomposition Hom C(X, Y) =H(X, Y)⊕I(X, Y)⊕R(X, Y), the differential reads
µ1=
0 0 0
0 0 ∗
0 0 0
.
Remark 2.24. Given a homological splitting H⊕I⊕R, we write an element x∈HomC(X, Y) typically
in tuple form as
x= (h, µ1(r′), r),with h∈H, r′∈R, r∈R.
Definition 2.25. LetCbe an A∞-category and H⊕I⊕Ra homological splitting. The codifferential
is the map
h: Hom C(X, Y)→R(X, Y),
(h, µ1(r′), r)7→r′, h∈H(X, Y), r′∈R(X, Y), r∈R(X, Y).
Theprojection to cohomology is the map
π: Hom C(X, Y) =H(X, Y)⊕I(X, Y)⊕R(X, Y)↠H(X, Y).
At this stage we are ready to recall the classical Kadeishvili construction. Its intention is to construct a
minimal model H Cexplicitly. The starting point for the construction is a homological splitting H⊕I⊕Rof
C. The result of the construction is an A∞-structure on {H(X, Y)}X,Y∈Cwhich can also be interpreted as
anA∞-structure on {H Hom C(X, Y)}X,Y∈C, since H(X, Y) and H Hom C(X, Y) are isomorphic as graded
vector spaces through the composition H(X, Y),→Ker(µ1)↠H Hom C(X, Y). Specifically, the A∞-
structure on H(X, Y) is defined via trees. We fix terminology as follows:
Definition 2.26. AKadeishvili tree shape Tis a rooted planar tree with n≥2 leaves whose non-leaf
nodes all have at least 2 children. A node in Tisinternal if it is not a leaf and not the root. The
number of internal nodes in Tis denoted NT. We denote by Tnthe set of all Kadeishvili tree shapes with
nleaves.
AKadeishvili π-tree (T, h 1, . . . , h n) is a Kadeishvili tree shape T∈ Tnwith n≥2 leaves, together
with a sequence h1, . . . , h nof cohomology elements hi∈H(Xi, Xi+1). Decorate the leaves by h1, . . . , h n
in sequence. Decorate every non-root node with the operation hµand the root with the operation πµ.
Then the result Res(T, h 1, . . . , h n)∈H(X1, Xn+1) of the Kadeishvili π-tree is the result obtained by
evaluating the tree from leaves to the root, according to the decorations.
The construction of the A∞-product µHon HCcan be summarized as follows: Let h1, . . . , h nbe
cohomology elements with hi∈H(Xi, Xi+1). Then their higher product is defined as
µHC(hn, . . . , h 1) =X
T∈Tn(−1)NTRes(T, h 1, . . . , h n)∈H(X1, Xn+1).
Theorem 2.27 (Kadeishvili, [17, Chapter 6, 3.3.2]) .LetCbe an A∞-category. Then the products µHC
define an A∞-structure on H C. Equipped with this structure, H Cis a minimal model for C.
16In the remainder of the section, we recall the deformed Kadeishvili construction from [18] in a special
case. The starting point is an A∞-category Cwith a deformation Cqsuch that the curvature of Cqvanishes
and the deformed differential satisfies µ1
q(H(X, Y))⊆µ1
q(Bb⊗R(X, Y)). We termed this the “ D= 0” case
in [18] and it turns out that in this case both the curvature µ0
HCqand the differential µ1
HCqof the minimal
model vanish.
Definition 2.28. LetCbe an A∞-category and Cqa deformation. Let H⊕I⊕Rbe a homological
splitting of C. Assume Cqis curvature-free with µ1
q(Bb⊗H(X, Y))⊆µ1
q(Bb⊗R(X, Y)). Then the map µ1
q
is injective on Bb⊗R(X, Y):
µ1
q|Bb⊗R(X,Y):Bb⊗R(X, Y)∼− →µ1
q(Bb⊗R(X, Y)).
Forh∈Bb⊗H(X, Y) denote by εh∈Bb⊗R(X, Y) the unique element such that µ1
q(h−εh) = 0. The
deformed counterpart ofh∈Bb⊗H(X, Y) is the element h−εh. Put
Hq(X, Y) ={h−εh|h∈Bb⊗H(X, Y)}.
Thedeformed splitting ofCqis the decomposition of all hom spaces of Cqas
HomCq(X, Y) =Hq(X, Y)⊕µ1
q(Bb⊗R(X, Y))⊕(Bb⊗R(X, Y)).
The correspondence between Hq(X, Y) and Bb⊗H(X, Y) is denoted
φ:Hq(X, Y)∼− − − − − → Bb⊗H(X, Y),
h−εh7− − − − − → h.
Thedeformed codifferential ofCqis the B-linear map
hq= (µ1
q|Bb⊗R(X,Y))−1:µ1
q(Bb⊗R(X, Y))− − − − − → Bb⊗R(X, Y).
Thedeformed projection ofCqis the B-linear map
πq: Hom Cq(X, Y) =Hq(X, Y)⊕µ1
q(Bb⊗R(X, Y))⊕(Bb⊗R(X, Y))→Hq(X, Y).
The meaning of the condition µ1
q(Bb⊗H(X, Y))⊆µ1
q(Bb⊗R(X, Y)) becomes evident when we regard
the shape of µ1
qwith respect to the deformed splitting:
Lemma 2.29 ([18]).LetCbe an A∞-category and Cqa deformation. Let H⊕I⊕Rbe a homological
splitting of C. Assume Cqis curvature-free with µ1

the deformed splitting of Cq, the differential µ1
qtakes the shape

Definition 2.30. LetTbe a Kadeishvili tree shape and h1, . . . , h kbe compatible morphisms in Cq.
Decorate the tree Tby putting φ−1(hi) on the leaves, hqµCqon every internal node and φπqµCqon the
root. Define the Res q(T, h 1, . . . , h k) as the result of the evaluation.
We are now ready to describe the minimal model H Cq. As a deformation of H C, it carries the same
objects as Cand its hom spaces are Hom HCq(X, Y) =Bb⊗H Hom C(X, Y). The deformed A∞-structure
takes the following shape:

3 Preliminaries on gentle algebras
In this section, we concisely recapitulate background on gentle algebras in order to bring the reader
into touch with the relevant tools of this paper. We provide definitions of all preliminaries and explain
alternative points of view on them. In particular, we will explain how every definition is used in the
paper. We follow mostly [9] and [10].
3.1 Punctured surfaces
Punctured surfaces belong to the family of two-dimensional oriented manifolds, while at the same time
facilitating singular behavior at the punctures.
Definition 3.1. Apunctured surface is a closed oriented surface Swith a finite set of punctures
M⊆S. We assume that |M| ≥1, or|M| ≥3 ifSis a sphere.
A selection of popular punctured surfaces are depicted in Figure 3.1. The condition |M| ≥1 and
|M| ≥3 are merely cosmetic and will be explained in section 3.2.
Remark 3.2. A punctured surface can alternatively be interpreted as a surface with S1boundaries:
Let ( S, M ) be a punctured surface and regard one puncture q∈M. The surface around qlooks like
a punctured disk. Now interpret the punctured disk as an infinitely long cylinder, glued to the rest of
the surface. Cut off the cylinder at some distance. We obtain a surface with S1boundaries, which we
interpret as markings. In other words, we have a marked surface with only S1boundaries in the sense
of [16]. For instance, cutting away disks around the punctures in the three-punctured sphere, we obtain
the popular pair of pants surface.
3.2 Arc systems
In this section, we recall the notion of arcs and arc systems on punctured surfaces. We recall what it
means for an arc system to be full, and explain how it cuts the surface into polygons. We fix some
terminology regarding polygons, in particular the notion of a polygon’s interior angles.
Definition 3.3. Let ( S, M ) be a punctured surface. An arcinSis a not necessarily closed curve
γ: [0,1]→Srunning from one puncture to another. An arc system Aon a punctured surface is a finite
collection of arcs which meet only at the set Mof punctures. Intersections and self-intersections are not
allowed. The arc system satisfies the no monogons or digons condition [NMD] if
•No arc is a contractible loop in S\M.
•No pair of distinct arcs is homotopic in S\M.
The arc system satisfies the no monogons or digons in the closed surface condition [NMDC] if
•No arc is a contractible loop in S.
•No pair of distinct arcs is homotopic in S.
Example 3.4. In Figure 3.2, we have depicted a few arbitrary arc systems on the three- and four-
punctured sphere and one-punctured torus. The drawn three-punctured sphere has the north and south
pole marked, as well as a point on the equator lying on the front half of the sphere. The four-punctured
sphere has the north and south pole, as well as a point in the far east and far west marked.
Example 3.5. The arc system of Figure 3.2a consists of two half meridians lying in the frontal hemi-
sphere. The arc system of Figure 3.2b consists of the frontal half of the equator and a northern half of
a meridian. The one-punctured torus Figure 3.2c is drawn as a gluing diagram. The arc system consists
of the two standard generators of the torus.

Figure 3.2: Arc systems and their properties
Remark 3.6. The configurations banned by [NMD] are depicted in Figure 3.2d and 3.2e. The reason to
ban these is that the definition of the A∞-structure on the gentle algebras becomes a lot easier, avoiding
a so-called monogon or digon rule. This makes checking the A∞-axioms also more tractable. With the
[NMDC] condition, we go a step further and ban also monogons and digons in the closed surface S.
More concretely, we ban loops which become contractible when the punctures are filled. Such a banned
configuration is depicted in Figure 3.2f. Similarly, we ban pairs of homotopic arcs, the homotopy being
allowed to cross punctures. Such a banned configuration is depicted in Figure 3.2g. The purpose of the
[NMDC] condition is to avoid the monogon and digon rule also for the deformed gentle algebras.
Definition 3.7. An arc system is fullif it cuts the surface into contractible pieces. These pieces are the
faces orpolygons of the arc system.
In other words, an arc system is full if its complement consists of a disjoint union of topological disks.
We usually refer to these pieces as polygons to highlight that they are bounded by arcs of the arc system.
Example 3.8. Of the three arc systems presented in Figure 3.2, only 3.2a and 3.2c are full. Arc system
3.2b is not full, because the complement of the arcs is a topological disk with a puncture in its interior,
the south pole. Removing any arc from 3.2a or 3.2c also leads to a non-full arc system. Additional arcs
may however be added to make or keep the arc system full. For example, in 3.2a one may add the full
equator as arc and in 3.2c one may add any diagonal as arc, but not both. All possible types of arc
systems with [NMDC] on the three-punctured sphere are depicted in Figure 3.4. In these figures, the
directions of the arcs is arbitrary. Only the arc systems in the third and fourth picture are full.
The reason we demand arc systems on spheres to have |M| ≥3 punctures becomes apparent: The
[NMD] condition excludes the case of digons bounded by two different arcs, but we also desire to exclude
the case where a digon is bounded by twice the same arc, depicted in Figure 3.3b. The only arc system
with a digon bounded by twice the same arc is however the two-punctured sphere, depicted in Figure 3.3c.
This is the reason we require |M| ≥3.
Definition 3.9. Theinterior angles of a polygon are the angles in the corners of the polygon. By
angle , we refer to the abstract entity (an interval starting at one arc and ending at the other, winding
around their common endpoint) instead of the angle value.
Since the punctured surface comes with an orientation, the interior angles of every polygon come with
a natural cyclic (clockwise) order, see Figure 3.3a. Working with arc systems often requires arguing with
properties of the polygons and their angles. Some configurations of arcs and angles are allowed under
the [NMDC] condition, others not.
Remark 3.10. In a [NMD] arc system, every polygon is bounded by a sequence of arcs with at least
three interior angles in between. Indeed, zero angles bounding a polygon would mean the polygon is
bounded by a single puncture. The punctured surface would necessarily be a one-punctured sphere,
which we banned. A single angle bounding a polygon would mean that the polygon is bounded by a loop
contractible in S\M, which we banned. Two angles bounding a polygon would mean they are equal, or
distinct and homotopic in S\M. Both options are banned. In summary, every polygon in a [NMD] arc
system is bounded by a sequence of arcs with at least three interior angles in between.

3.3 Dimers
Dimer models, also referred to as brane tilings, originate in physicists’ description of mirror symmetry.
The idea is to describe arrangements of branes on the A-side of mirror symmetry in a surface graph. In
a dimer model, adjacent nodes have opposite color. Dimer models can be seen as specific instances of
punctured surfaces. A comprehensive reference is [6].
Definition 3.11. Adimer Qis a full arc system on a punctured surface such that
•every polygon is bounded by at least three arcs,
•the arcs along the boundary of a polygon are all oriented in the same direction.
The letter Qalso denotes the quiver, obtained from the arc system: Its vertex set Q0is the set of
punctures and its arrow set Q1is the set of arcs. The underlying closed surface is denoted |Q|.
All polygons in a dimer are bounded either entirely clockwise or entirely anticlockwise. Neighboring
polygons are bounded opposite: A polygon next to a clockwise polygon is anticlockwise, and a polygon
next to an anticlockwise polygon is clockwise. The standard notation for a dimer is the letter Q, minding
the fact that the punctures together with the arcs can also be interpreted as a quiver embedded in a
surface.
Remark 3.12. Every punctured surface has an arc system that is a dimer. Standard dimer models for
then-punctured sphere ( n≥3) and n-punctured torus ( n≥1) are depicted in Figure 3.5a and 3.5b. A
dimer automatically satisfies the [NMD] condition. There are however dimers which violate the [NMDC]
condition, an example is depicted in Figure 3.5c.
3.4 Gentle algebras
In this section, we recall gentle algebras associated with arc systems. We use a specific definition of gentle
algebras, due to Bocklandt [9]. The reason they appear in this paper is that they form discrete models for
Fukaya categories of punctured surfaces. In the present section, we describe only the algebra structure.
TheA∞-structure will be added in section 3.5.
As their name suggests, gentle algebras are originally a type of finite-dimensional algebras. In [4], it
was shown that so-called “unpunctured marked surface triangulations” naturally give rise to such gentle
20algebras. For readers familiar with Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich’s work [16], these are marked surfaces
where all S1boundary components have at least one marking. The construction of gentle algebras from
surfaces was subsequently carried over by Bocklandt [9] to the case of marked surfaces with full arc
systems, as defined in section 3.2. The definition is essential for this paper:
Definition 3.13. LetAbe a full arc system on a punctured surface. Then the gentle algebra (as
ordinary algebra) Gtl A=CRA/Iis the quiver algebra with relations, where:
•The vertices of RAare given by the arc midpoints of the arc system.
•The arrows of RAare given by the interior angles of the polygons.
•The relations in Iare given by all products of two consecutive interior angles of a polygon.
The quiver RAhas as many vertices as the arc system has arcs, as many arrows as the arc system
has interior angles, and every polygon gives rise to as many relations as it has interior angles. The quiver
RAis called the rectified quiver in [9]. Figure 3.6 depicts some arc systems together with their rectified
quivers. The left part of each graphic is the arc system itself, with arcs drawn thick. The interior angles
are drawn as thin arrows; in the three- and four-punctured sphere, the dashed arrows mean the interior
angles at the rear, invisible side of the sphere. The right part of each graphic depicts the rectified quiver
together with its relations.
A vector space basis for the gentle algebra Gtl Aconsists of all angles around punctures. The basis
includes an identity id afor every arc a∈ A, which we may also view as an empty angle. The gentle
algebra Gtl Aof an arc system is not finite-dimensional.
Remark 3.14. By nature, the algebra Gtl A=CRA/Ican be viewed as a C-linear category with
objects being the arcs of the arc system. The hom spaces are spanned freely by the angles winding
around punctures, starting at one arc and ending at another arc. In [9], this interpretation of Gtl Ais
also called the “gentle category”. We will consistently use the term gentle algebra instead, despite the
slight inaccuracy.
Remark 3.15. In the work of Haiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich [16], gentle algebras were developed
further under the name of “topological Fukaya categories“. This includes a generalization regarding
the type of boundary allowed. The version of gentle algebra we defined above is called a surface with
fully marked boundaries of S1type in [16]. If one changes the boundary type to have at least one
so-called “boundary arc” on every boundary component, the topological Fukaya category becomes finite-
dimensional. The gentle algebras Gtl Astudied in the present paper are however infinite-dimensional
by nature: One can keep winding around the punctures as often as one wants, obtaining morphisms of
higher and higher length.
It might be worthwhile comparing to the original definition due to [4]: A finite-dimensional algebra
presented as CQ/I isgentle if
•At each vertex there start at most two arrows and there end at most two arrows.
•The ideal Iis generated by paths of length 2.
•For every arrow β, there is at most one arrow αsuch that αβ∈I, and at most one arrow γsuch
thatβγ∈I.
•For every arrow β, there is at most one arrow αsuch that αβ /∈I, and at most one arrow γsuch
thatβγ /∈I.
The same paper [4] showed how surface triangulations naturally give rise to gentle algebras.
3.5 The A∞-structure on GtlA
In this section, we recall the A∞-structure on Gtl A. The starting point is the description of Gtl Aas
ordinary algebra in section 3.4. The idea is to add A∞-structure which captures the topology of the
punctured surface. This A∞-structure was introduced by Bocklandt [9] in order to define a discrete
version of the wrapped Fukaya category. In the present section, we recall the A∞-structure briefly and
refer to [7, Section 9.1] and [16] and for more insight.
We start with a full arc system Awith [NMD]. The first step towards the A∞-structure is the grading.
It is possible to put a Z-grading on Gtl Aby viewing arcs and angles relative to a vector field on the
surface, see section 5.1. The deformations of Gtl Athat we are interested in exist however only in the
Z/2Z-graded world. Consequentially, we define Gtl Aas aZ/2Z-graded A∞-category from the very
beginning. The definition of degrees is depicted in Figure 3.7 and reads as follows:

Definition 3.16. Thedegree |α|of an angle α:a→bis odd if one of the arcs a, bpoints towards the
puncture, and one points away from the puncture. The degree of an angle is even if both arcs point away
or both point towards the puncture.
The second step in the definition of the A∞-structure is the definition of the differential µ1and the
product µ2. The differential µ1is plainly set to zero. We keep the notation αβfor the concatenation of
angles, and define the product µ2as its signed version:
µ1:= 0, µ2(α, β):= (−1)|β|αβ.
Remark 3.17. The reason we assume the [NMD] condition is that it simplifies the definition of µ1and
µ2. Indeed, can also define the A∞-structure for arc systems without [NMD]. However, the definition of
µ1andµ2then needs to be tweaked in order to capture the monogons and digons.
The third step is to define the higher products µ≥3of Gtl A. They capture the topology of the arcs
and angles. Roughly speaking, a higher product of a sequence of angles is nonzero if the sequence bounds
a disk. Such a disk is given by an immersion of the standard polygon Pkinto the surface S, known as
immersed disk. The domain of the immersion mapping is a standard polygon Pk, depicted in Figure 3.8a.
To distinguish this type of immersed disks from the type used for the Fukaya category, we shall refer to
these disks as discrete immersed disks. The precise definition reads as follows:

Figure 3.9: Stitching together polygons yields immersed disks
The immersion mapping Ditself is only taken up to reparametrization. The sequence of interior angles
ofDis the sequence of angles in Agiven as images of the interior angles of Pkunder the map D. An
angle sequence α1, . . . , α kis adisk sequence if it is the sequence of interior angles of some discrete
immersed disk.
To explain the definition in other words, the image of the interior of the polygon Pkconsists only of
polygon interiors of Aand arcs between punctures, but not punctures themselves. The boundary of Pk
is mapped to a sequence of arcs, and the corners inside Pkare mapped to an angle sequence in the arc
system.
Example 3.19. The interior angles of a polygon, when written in clockwise order, are a disk sequence.
In particular, if the arc system Ahas a triangle polygon in it, then there exists an disk sequence in Aof
just 3 angles. In every case, by the ban on loops and homotopic arcs, an disk sequence α1, . . . , α kconsists
of at least three angles, i.e. k≥3. In Figure 3.8a, we have depicted the schematic of a standard polygon.
In Figure 3.8b, we have depicted a discrete immersed disk together with its sequence of interior angles.
By definition, this sequence is a disk sequence. In Figure 3.8c, we have depicted an angle sequence which
is not a disk sequence. The reason it is not a disk sequence is that there is a polygon immersion bounded
by the drawn angles, but it covers the puncture at the center of the hexagon. Later on, we will however
allow polygon immersions which cover punctures as part of the deformation Gtl qA.
Disk sequences α1, . . . , α kcan also be described combinatorically: They are either a polygon in A,
or stitched together from multiple polygons along arcs. Figure 3.9 depicts two examples of stitching
polygons together to form disk sequences. In every example, multiple triangles are stitched together to
form a polygon. Thick connectors between two triangles indicate that these triangles are going to be
stitched together along their shared edge. The first example is visually easy to grasp, since the three
triangles are disjoint. In the second example, seven triangles are stitched together, with one triangle
appearing twice. The result is a disk sequence of nine angles α1, . . . , α 9, of which one is longer than a
full turn. The sketch on the right of the “=” sign provides a visualization of this discrete immersed disk
by thinking a third dimension into the picture. In that 3-dimensional sketch, the angle longer than a full
turn is drawn dashed, the other angles are omitted and the outer boundary of the hexagon is depicted
as a spiral instead of separate arcs.
Remark 3.20. In section 3.6, we change the terminology. From there on, discrete immersed disks are
allowed to cover punctures.
We are now ready to give the definition of the higher products µ≥3. Since these products are supposed
to be multilinear, it suffices to define them on the basis of Gtl Agiven by angles winding around punctures.
Definition 3.21. LetAbe an full arc system with [NMD]. Then Gtl Ais the A∞-category with objects
being the arcs a∈ A, hom spaces spanned by angles, and A∞-product µdefined by µ1= 0 and µ2(α, β) =
23(−1)|β|αβ. To define µk≥3, letα1, . . . , α kbe any disk sequence, let βbe an angle composable with α1,
i.e.βα1̸= 0, and let γbe an angle post-composable with αk, i.e. αkγ̸= 0. Then
µk(βαk, . . . , α 1):=β, µk(αk, . . . , α 1γ):= (−1)|γ|γ.
The higher products vanish on all angle sequences other than these.
Example 3.22. Let us go through a few examples. Regard the one-punctured torus of Figure 3.6b. The
angles αandγare odd, and βandδare even. Angle degrees add up, for instance βγδis odd and γδαis
even. The product µ2has
µ2(δ, γ) =−δγ, µ2(αβγδα, βγδ ) =−αβγδαβγδ =−(αβγδ )2andµ2(β, α) = 0 .
The higher product µ3vanishes because there are no triangles. From µ4onwards, we have higher products,
for instance
µ4(δ, γ, β, α ) = id bandµ6(γ, βγ, β, α, δα, δ ) = id a.
A little less obvious is the A∞-product
µ12(α, δ, γδ, γ, βγ, β, αβ, α, δα, δ, γ, βγδαβ ) = id a,
which is “winds” one and a quarter times around the puncture, without covering the puncture itself
though. The second disk sequence in Figure 3.9 is very similar and also yields an identity.
After defining this structure, Bocklandt [9] proved that with this grading and products Gtl Ais indeed
anA∞-category.
Theorem 3.23 ([9]).LetAbe a full arc system with [NMD]. Then Gtl Ais an A∞-category.
Remark 3.24. In [9], the signs in the definition of the higher products µkon Gtl Adiffer from the signs
presented here. We follow the sign convention of [16].
Remark 3.25. Every angle sequence α1, . . . , α keither bounds a unique discrete immersed disk or no
disk at all. If it bounds a disk, then the products µ(αk, . . . , α 1γ) and µ(βαk, . . . , α 1) are nonzero. If it
bounds no disk, then the products vanish.
Remark 3.26. Let us explain that that the degrees match. The A∞-product µkis required to be of
parity 2 −k. Ifα1, . . . , α kis any disk sequence, then the total reduced degree
∥α1∥+. . .+∥αk∥ ∈Z/2Z
measures how often the boundary of the discrete immersed disk changes orientation when traversing it
clockwise. Since a disk sequence traverses the boundary one full time, it ends up with the same orientation
as it started. In other words, the total reduced degree of a disk sequence vanishes. This means that µk
has the right parity.
Remark 3.27. The interior angles of a discrete immersed disk are enumerated clockwise as α1, . . . , α k,
while the higher product consumes them only in the order αk, . . . , α 1. This seemingly unusual order of
the factors α1, . . . , βα kis due to the convention on A∞-categories.
Remark 3.28. It is not possible to write a given angle sequence γk, . . . , γ 1asβαk, . . . , α 1orαk, . . . , α 1γ
in two different ways. In fact, the immersion of the polygon is already determined by all angles but one,
and an angle sequence of the form βαk, . . . , α 1cannot be written as α′
k, . . . , α′
1γwith both α1, . . . , α k
andα′
1, . . . , α′
kbeing disk sequences. This is explained e.g. in [16]. We conclude that any angle sequence
can be written in at most one way as βαk, . . . , α 1orαk, . . . , α 1γwith α1, . . . , α ka disk sequence. This
makes the product µk(γk, . . . , γ 1) well-defined for every angle sequence γ1, . . . , γ k.
3.6 The deformation Gtl qA
In this section we define the deformation Gtl qAof a gentle algebra Gtl A. It is a specific instance of the
deformations constructed in [10] and lies at the heart of the present paper. We give an explicit definition
in order to provide a feel for this category. We provide a first glance concerning the use of Gtl qAin the
later sections.
This paper is the second in a series of three, and the first paper [10] was concerned with classifying
theA∞-deformations of Gtl A. A conclusion from that paper is that all deformations of Gtl Aup to
24gauge equivalence can be written down explicitly. In this paper, we select one of these deformations,
which we call the deformed gentle algebra and denote by Gtl qA. Other deformations of Gtl Aplay no
role anymore.
The deformation Gtl qAis very broad in the sense that it has a lot of deformation parameters, in fact
one for each puncture. Any reader who wishes to work with the calculations of this paper can therefore
freely set some of these deformation parameters to zero and still have an interesting deformation at hand.
Conversely, the deformation Gtl qAis so broad that the reader who is interested in deformations not
“covered” by Gtl qAcan still derive qualitative expectations on the behavior of the other deformations.
Remark 3.29. Arguably, one would like to conduct the study of the present paper also for all the
other deformations given in [10]. The idea would be to use multiple parameters per puncture, so as
to include deformations in Gtl qAthat measure orbigons around punctures (see [10]). One reason we
restrict to the single deformation Gtl qAis that “orbigon deformations” are more difficult to handle than
“disk deformations”. Another reason is that the relative Fukaya category relFuk( S, M ) also has only
“disk deformations” as well, so a candidate for a small model of relFuk( S, M ) should only have “disk
deformations” at all. This is why we only regard the deformation Gtl qA, which has one parameter per
puncture.
The deformation base of Gtl qAisB=CJMK. This is the commutative local ring of power series
in|M|variables, one for each puncture. In fact, to capture the punctures covered by an immersion of
a standard polygon, every puncture should have one deformation parameter. For this reason we use
B=CJMK. Every puncture q∈Mgives rise to one deformation parameter, which is also denoted qand
lies in the ring CJMKas one of the generators.
Remark 3.30. We use the letter “ q” as in three different meanings in this paper, depending on the
context: First, the notation Gtl qAis fixed and the letter qdoes not have any meaning there. Second,
whenever a specific puncture is considered, it is typically named q. Third, whenever qis used multiplica-
tively in formulas, then it denotes the infinitesimal parameter q∈CJMK. For example, if p, q∈Mare
punctures, then pqsimply means the product pq∈CJMK.
As a warm-up for the definition of Gtl qA, recall that the angle sequence α1, . . . , α 6of Figure 3.10c
is not a disk sequence. This means that µ6(α6, . . . , α 1) = 0 in Gtl A. The deformation Gtl qAprecisely
changes this and similar higher products, while keeping the A∞-relations intact. In short, the deformed
higher products of Gtl qAprecisely capture which and how often punctures are covered by an immersion
of a standard polygon. From here on, we drop the requirement that a discrete immersed disk does not
cover punctures:
Definition 3.31. LetAbe a full arc system with [NMDC]. A discrete immersed disk inAis an
oriented immersion of a standard polygon PkintoSup to reparametrization such that the edges of the
polygon are mapped to a sequence of arcs. A disk sequence is an angle sequence together with a choice
of discrete immersed disk of which it is the sequence of interior angles. We denote by M(α1, . . . , α k) the
set of discrete immersed disks Dwith interior angles α1, . . . , α k. For D∈M(α1, . . . , α k), we denote by
qD∈CJMKthe product of the punctures covered by D.
Remark 3.32. In contrast to section 3.5, for a given angle sequence α1, . . . , α kthere might be multiple
discrete immersed disks which have the same interior angle sequence α1, . . . , α k. To see this, regard
Bennequin’s curve in Figure 3.10a. This smooth curve bounds five immersed disks which are not related
by reparametrization. If we draw a fine enough grid in the surface and approximate the curve by arcs in
the grid, then we obtain an angle sequence which bounds multiple distinct discrete immersed disks.
The deformation Gtl qAhas infinitesimal curvature, and there are three ways to describe the curvature:
Each puncture q∈Mcontributes curvature qℓq∈(M)b⊗GtlAto Gtl qA. Here ( M)⊆CJMKdenotes the
maximal ideal of CJMKandℓqdenotes the sum of all full turns around q, summed over all arc incidences
atq. In other words, the total curvature µ0
qof Gtl qAis the sum over all puncture contributions:
µ0
q:=X
q∈Mqℓq.
In yet other words, we can describe the individual curvature of an arc a∈ A. It carries curvature
µ0
q,agiven as the sum of the two turns around its endpoints, multiplied by the deformation parameters
h(a), t(a)∈CJMKassociated with the arc’s endpoints.
In order to define the products on Gtl qA, it suffices to describe them on basis elements of Gtl A. The
continuous CJMK-multilinear extension is then automatic, see Remark 2.11. We are now ready to state
the definition of Gtl qA:

Example 3.34. For reference, let us go through a few example evaluations: The torus of Figure 3.6b
has one puncture, two arcs and four interior angles. The gentle algebra Gtl Atherefore has two objects
and four generators of the morphism spaces. The figure also includes a list of basis elements for Gtl A.
What is the deformation Gtl qAhere? Since there is just one puncture q∈M={q}, the deformation
base for Gtl qAisB=CJqK. The arcs aandbget curvature

The product µ2remains non-deformed, for example we still have µ2
q(δ, γ) =−δγandµ2
q(β, α) = 0 as in
the non-deformed case, but we can now also insert parameters as in µ2
q(qδ, q2γ) =−q3δγ. The higher
product µ3remains zero, because there are no triangles. The higher product µ4(δ, γ, β, α ) = id bhas still
the non-deformed value, and µ6(γ, βγ, β, α, δα, δ ) = id a. Deformed products appear for example in
µ8
q(δ, γδ, γ, βγ, β, αβ, α, δα ) =qidb,
the sequence is inscribed in a 2-by-2 rectangle covering the puncture once. More generally, we have the
(m−1)-by-( n−1) rectangles covering the puncture qprecisely ( m−1)(n−1) times:

n−1, β, αβ, . . . , αβ|{z}
m−1, α, δα, . . . , δα|{z}
n−1) =q(m−1)(n−1).
Remark 3.35. We view Gtl Aas aZ/2Z-graded A∞-category and Gtl qAas aZ/2Z-graded deformation.
Let us explain why the deformed products µk
qsatisfy the requirement to be of degree 2 −k. First, the
curvature µ0
q,aon every arc a∈ Aconsists of a full turn and is automatically even. Second, regard e.g. the
deformed higher product
µk
q(βαk, . . . , α 1) =q1. . . q mβ.
Here the angles α1, . . . , α kare a disk sequence possibly covering the punctures q1, . . . , q m. In fact, the
disk sequence ends at the opposite side of the arc as it started, so the total reduced degree
∥α1∥+. . .+∥αk∥
is still even, which means that βhas the same parity as α1, . . . , βα kplus 2 −k. This affirms that the
products of Gtl qAhave the right degree.

Figure 3.12: Despite sharing multiple arcs, the two strands continue differently and do not finish a period.
Remark 3.36. In the Z-graded world, the deformation Gtl qAdoes not exist. Indeed, the curvature
µ0
q,aof an arc a∈ Ais a full turn and its degree depends on the vector field used for the Z-grading. It is
still possible in the Z-grading to define a deformation Gtl qAwhich only includes those punctures where
the full turn has degree 2. This would then also give the deformed higher products the right degree. But
such a deformation has far fewer deformation parameters and is less interesting than the Z/2Z-graded
version.
In [10], we have already defined Gtl qAfrom a slightly more general starting point. In fact, the
starting point of [10] is a deformation base Band a deformation parameter r∈mZ(GtlA), where
Z(GtlA) denotes the center of Gtl Aas an ordinary algebra. To the datum of r, the construction in [10]
associates a deformed A∞-structure lµ..r. In order to obtain the specific case of µqfrom this construction,
we have to put B=CJMKandr=P
q∈Mqℓq. We have checked in [10] that Gtl rAsatisfies the curved
A∞-relations. In particular, this holds for the special case Gtl qA:
Theorem 3.37 ([10]).LetAbe a full arc system with [NMDC]. Then Gtl qAis an A∞-deformation of
GtlA.
3.7 Zigzag paths
In this section, we recall the notion of zigzag paths. These are combinatorical tools defined specifically
for dimers. The idea is to follow the arrows of a dimer by alternatingly turning left and right. In the
presentation of zigzag paths, we mostly follow [9] and [13].
Zigzag paths appear in this paper for two reasons: First, one uses them to define whether a dimer
Qis zigzag consistent or not. Second, zigzag paths themselves can be realized as twisted complexes in
Tw Gtl qQ, and the aim of this paper is to compute the minimal model of this category. Of course, it is
not a coincidence that zigzag paths appear twice: The zigzag consistency of Qwill help us perform the
minimal model calculations of zigzag paths by ruling out lots of difficult cases. We recall zigzag paths as
follows:
Definition 3.38. LetQbe a dimer. A zigzag path Lis an infinite path . . . a 2a1a0a−1a−2. . .of arcs in
Qtogether with an alternating choice of “left” or “right” for every i∈Nsuch that
•ai+1ailies in a clockwise polygon if iis assigned “right”,
•ai+1ailies in a counterclockwise polygon if iis assigned “left”.
We also say that Lturns left ataiifiis assigned “left” and turns right ifaiis assigned “right”. Two
zigzag paths are identified if their paths including left/right indications differ only by integer shift.
Since Qis finite, every zigzag path is periodic and has a shortest period i0∈N, which is defined as
the smallest integer such that the zigzag path is invariant under shift by i0. The period is not necessarily
reached when an arc reappears in the zigzag path. The path may namely continue in a different way
beyond that arc. In general, the period need not even be reached when a whole sequence of arcs reappears
in the zigzag path. An example is depicted in Figure 3.12.
Definition 3.39. Thelength of a zigzag path is the shortest period i0∈N.
Slightly simplified, a zigzag path Lis a path in Qthat turns alternatingly maximally right and
maximally left in Q. The typical shape of a zigzag path is drawn in Figure 3.11. If every puncture of Q
has valence at least 4, then a path of length two cannot simultaneously lie in the boundary of a clockwise

and a counterclockwise polygon. In this case, the left/right indication for zigzag paths is a superfluous
part of the datum of a zigzag path. For other dimers Q, the left/right indication is very important. An
example is the n-punctured sphere Qnof Figure 3.5a. If nis odd, then Qnhas only one zigzag path, its
length is 2 n. Ifnis even, then Qnhas two zigzag paths each of length n. This way, we deviate slightly
from the definition of [9].
3.8 Geometric consistency
In this section, we recall what it means for a dimer to be geometrically consistent. This notion is
important for the paper, because we will permanently work with a fixed geometrically consistent dimer,
see Convention 6.10. Geometric consistency is a specific instance of various consistency conditions which
can be imposed on dimers. A summary can be found in [8], which we also follow here. In this section,
we recall universal covers and zigzag rays and then define geometric consistency.
As first step, we recall the universal cover of Q. Recall that Qitself consists of a closed surface |Q|
together with an arc system that satisfies the dimer property. Regard the universal cover |˜Q|of the closed
surface |Q|. We can construct an arc system on |˜Q|by lifting all punctures and arcs to the universal
cover, in all possible ways. This gives an (infinite) arc system on |˜Q|which also has the dimer property.
The universal cover together with its lifted arc system is simply denoted ˜Q.
As second step, we recall the notion of zigzag rays. In contrast to zigzag paths, zigzag rays only run
in one direction, starting from a given arc. Since we only need zigzag rays in the context of the universal
cover, let us directly formulate their definition in ˜Q. The four zigzag rays starting at an arc a∈˜Q1are
depicted in Figure 3.13a.
Definition 3.40. LetQbe a dimer, ˜Qits universal cover and a∈˜Q1an arc. Then the four zigzag
rays starting at aare the sequences of arcs ( a1
i)i≥0, (a2
i)i≥0, (a3
i)i≥0and ( a4
i)i≥0in˜Qdetermined by
a1

•The sequences ( a1
i) and ( a2
i) satisfy h(a1/2
i) =t(a1/2
i+1).
•The sequences ( a3
i) and ( a4
i) satisfy t(a3/4
i) =h(a3/4
i+1).
•The path a1/2
i+1a1/2
ilies in the boundary of a counterclockwise polygon when iis odd/even, and
clockwise when iis even/odd.
•The path a3/4
ia3/4
i+1lies in the boundary of a counterclockwise polygon when iis odd/even, and
clockwise when iis even/odd.
A dimer is geometrically consistent if the zigzag rays starting with an arc ain the universal cover
intersect nowhere, except at aitself. The precise definition reads as follows:
Definition 3.41. LetQbe a dimer. Then Qisgeometrically consistent if for every a∈˜Q1the four
zigzag rays ( a1
i), (a2
i), (a3
i) and ( a4
i) satisfy the following property: Whenever ak
i=al
j, then i=jand
k=l, ori=j= 0.
Example 3.42. A dimer Qon a sphere is never geometrically consistent, because ˜Q=Qand therefore
any zigzag rays in ˜Qintersect after a while. There are plenty of geometrically consistent dimers on
surfaces of genus g≥1 though. For example, the n-punctured torus dimer of Figure 3.5b is geometrically
consistent. Indeed, the universal cover of the torus is the real plane, and the torus dimer lifts to horizon-
tally and vertically repeated copies of Figure 3.5b. The zigzag rays then run away in different directions
in the plane without ever coming closer to each other again. This geometry is a typical example of the
toric zigzag fan, see for example [26].

Remark 3.43. IfQis geometrically consistent, then a zigzag path LonQmay return to an arc
twice, however the segment of Lbetween both occurrences is not allowed to be contractible. If it were
contractible, then this segment would constitute a zigzag ray cutting itself (the case i=jandk=l),
contradicting geometric consistency.
Remark 3.44. A geometrically consistent dimer automatically satisfies the [NMDC] condition.
Geometric consistency is the strongest consistency condition one can require, apart from R-charge con-
sistency. Indeed, geometric consistency is by definition a stronger version of so-called zigzag consistency,
which in turn is known to be stronger than cancellation consistency, see [8]:
geometric consistency zigzag consistency cancellation consistency =⇒ =⇒R-charge consistency

3.9 Terminology for arcs and angles
In this section, we introduce technical terminology that we will use throughout the paper. This terminol-
ogy is important to describe exactly what happens where in a dimer. It bears no mathematical creativity
but is unavoidable for the sake of concise language.
The first notion is that of an arc incidence. This is comparable to half-edges in a ribbon graph.
Half-edges are not only a useful tool to describe graphs where one end of some edges is missing, but
half-edges are also handy to describe incidences in a graph. Whenever we would like to sum over all
edges incident at a given node, letting every loop contribute two (distinct) terms, the right entity to sum
over is the set of half-edges incident at the node. Similarly in a dimer Q, we would typically like to have
a set of all incidences of arcs, where loops contribute both their “head part” and their “tail part”. With
the terminology of head parts and tail parts, we can also talk about whether an angle starts at the head
part or tail part of an arrow. This piece of terminology is depicted in Figure 3.15.
Definition 3.45. Anarc incidence at a puncture q∈Q0is either an incident head part or an incident
tail part of some arc.
For instance, a loop a∈Q1with h(a) =t(a) =qhas two arc incidences at the puncture h(a) =
t(a). The sample puncture in Figure 3.14 has four arc incidences. Correspondingly, there are four
indecomposable angles around the puncture. In that figure, the loop is intended to be topologically
nontrivial, indicated by the dots “ . . .”.
Let us now introduce some terminology for angles in Q. Angles always have both an algebraic
interpretation as basis morphisms for Gtl Qand a geometric interpretation as winding around punctures
in the surface Q. We will therefore use double terminology from time to time: In algebraic contexts, we
say an angle is an identity if it is the identity id aof some arc a∈Q1. In geometric context, we call
such an angle empty and all other angles non-empty. For instance, a typical usage in a geometric context
would be to say that a certain angle αis non-empty and smaller than a full turn.
Definition 3.46. Letαbe an angle in Q. Then αis an empty angle if it is the identity of some arc.
Otherwise αis anon-empty angle.

(b) An indexed segment
Figure 3.17: Terminology in a zigzag path
Given an angle α, we would like to distinguish whether it is composed of multiple smaller angles or
not. By definition of the angles in Q, the smallest units are the interior angles of polygons. This already
gives us terminology for a geometric context: We can simply ask whether a given angle αis the interior
angle of some polygon or not. We however also need terminology for the algebraic context. Examples
are depicted in Figure 3.16. We fix terminology as follows:
Definition 3.47. An angle is decomposable if it is the composition of two non-empty angles. An angle
isindecomposable if it is non-empty and not decomposable.
Remark 3.48. An non-empty angle is indecomposable if it is an interior angle of some polygon, and
indecomposable otherwise. We regard empty angles as neither decomposable nor indecomposable.
Let us introduce terminology for locations on zigzag paths. Loosely speaking, we want to define an
“indexed arc” as an arc a∈Q1lying on L, but remember whether Lturns left or right after a. For
example, let 2 kbe the length of L, then Lhas precisely 2 kindexed arcs. Figure 3.17a features a visual
explanation: Some arc a3=a42appears twice while traversing L, one time at index 3 and one time at
index 42. The arc itself is the same in Q, but different as indexed arcs of L. This amount of precision
gives rise to further names for relative positions on L. For instance, we can regard indexed segments,
depicted in Figure 3.17b. We fix terminology as follows:
Definition 3.49. LetLbe a zigzag path, given by an infinite path . . . a 1a0a−1. . .together with left/right
indications.
•Anindexed arc onLis a tuple ( ai, i) consisting of one of the arcs on Ltogether with its index
modulo the period length of the zigzag path.
•Thenext arc after ( ai, i) is the indexed arc ( ai+1, i+ 1).
•Theprevious arc before ( ai, i) is the indexed arc ( ai−1, i−1).

Let us introduce terminology for angle sequences. We already have the very fortunate notion of
disk sequences available, but in order to analyze products in Tw Gtl Qwe need flexible terminology
to distinguish between the two rules that define higher products in Gtl Q. Let α1, . . . , α kbe a disk
sequence. Recall that the discrete immersed disk contained in the data of the disk sequence contributes
to the product µk
GtlqQ(αk, . . . , α 1). Now if βis an angle such that βαk̸= 0 and γis an angle such

that α1γ̸= 0, then the discrete immersed disk also contributes to the products µk
GtlqQ(βαk, . . . , α 1)
andµk
GtlqQ(αk, . . . , α 1γ). We want to call these contributions final-out and first-out, respectively. This
terminology is depicted in Figure 3.18. A more formal definition reads as follows:
Definition 3.50. LetQbe a dimer. Let α1, . . . , α kbe a disk sequence in Qwith discrete immersed disk
D. Let β, γbe non-empty angles such that βαk̸= 0 and α1γ̸= 0. Then:
•The sequence α1, . . . , βα ktogether with D is a final-out disk. We call βthe outside morphism and
αkthe inside morphism. We call t(α1) the first arc and t(αk) the final arc.
•The sequence α1γ, . . . , α ktogether with Dis afirst-out disk. We call γthe outside morphism and
α1the inside morphism. We call h(α1) the first arc and h(αk) the final arc.
•The sequence α1, . . . , α ktogether with Dis anall-in disk. We call the arc t(α1) =h(αk) the first,
equivalently final arc.
We may call an angle sequence together with a discrete immersed disk a some-out disk if it is first-out
or final-out. In the case of a some-out disk, the first and final arc share an endpoint, the concluding
puncture of the disk. In the case of an all-in disk, the first and final arc coincide, which is the concluding
arcof the disk.
Loosely speaking, all contributions to µ≥3
GtlqQcome from first-out, final-out or all-in disks. Some-out
means first-out or final-out. For a some-out disk, the concluding puncture is the one around which the
first or final angle winds and it is very important. The first and final arcs are those arcs that neighbor
the concluding puncture. For an all-in disk, the first and final arcs are the same and this single arc is
very important. Whenever we refer to first-out, final-out or all-in disks, we typicall pass the datum of
the discrete immersed disk implicitly. In Figure 3.18, the first and final arc are drawn thick and the
concluding puncture is marked with a dot. We may use wording like “towards the concluding puncture”
when referring to the behavior of a sequence of arcs, viewed in the direction of the concluding puncture.
Last but not least, we shall give some means to measure how large the inside angle is by counting
the “slots” inside and outside the disk. The terminology is included in Figure 3.18. We formalize this as
follows:
Definition 3.51. LetQbe a dimer. Let α1, . . . , α kbe a some-out disk and γbe its inside morphism.
Write ℓfor one full turn around the concluding puncture, starting at the final arc of the disk. Write
γ=γ′ℓnfor some nsuch that γ′is strictly smaller than one full turn. Take the complementary angle
(γ′)csuch that ( γ′)cγ′=ℓ.
•The number of slots inside the disk is the number of indecomposable angles that γ′consists of.
•The number of slots outside the disk is the number of indecomposable angles that ( γ′)cconsists
of.
4 Preliminaries of Fukaya categories
In this section, we recall basics of Fukaya categories. One after another, we recall the construction of the
Fukaya pre-category, Fukaya category, relative Fukaya pre-category and relative Fukaya category. The
core aim of the paper is to define the category Lqand interpret its minimal model H Lqas a part of the
relative Fukaya category. The present section aims to facilitate this understanding by preparing the view
31from the side of Fukaya categories. We have therefore included a dedicated description of the subcategory
of the relative Fukaya category given by so-called zigzag curves in section 4.5. Our main references are
[1, 14]. We comment on results of Efimov, Sheridan and Perutz.
4.1 The exact Fukaya pre-category
In this section, we review exact Fukaya pre-categories. They are not an immediate necessity for this
paper, since we only work with the discrete model Gtl qQ. The main result however ties H Tw Gtl qQto
the relative Fukaya category, so we will benefit from a review. We follow a combination of the highly
recommendable sources [1], [15] and [7, Chapter 6].
In symplectic geometry, one aims at defining a fully-fledged A∞-category Fuk Xfrom a symplectic
manifold X. A Fukaya category is supposed to have closed Lagrangians as objects and intersection
points as basis elements for the hom spaces. The products µ≥2are supposed to be formed from immersed
disks between Lagrangians. For Lagrangians lying in general position, this construction works well. It is
however not clear what the endomorphism space of a single Lagrangian Lshould be. We would expect
it to be a finite-dimensional vector space, and it should be equal for all small Hamiltonian deformations
ofL. This makes the full set of hom spaces and A∞products of a Fukaya category very hard to define.
The difficulty in defining a fully-fledged Fukaya category Fuk Xhas led to the introduction of pre-
categories as partial remedy: Products need not be defined on all sequences of morphisms, only on a
choice of transversal sequences.
Definition 4.1. AnA∞-pre-category Cconsists of the following data:
1. a set of objects Ob C,
2. for every N≥1 a set ( C)N
tr⊆(ObC)Noftransversal sequences , with ( C)1
tr= ObC,
3. for every ( X, Y)∈(C)2
tra graded hom space Hom( X, Y),
4. for every transversal sequence X1, . . . , X N+1with N≥1 a degree 2 −Nproduct map
µN: Hom( XN, XN+1)⊗. . .⊗Hom( X1, X2)→Hom( X1, XN+1),
such that each subsequence ( Xi1, . . . , X il) with 1 ≤i1< . . . < i l≤nof a transversal sequence X1, . . . , X n
is transversal as well, and the A∞-relation holds for Hom( XN, XN+1)⊗. . .⊗Hom( X1, X2) whenever
X1, . . . , X N+1is a transversal sequence.
Remark 4.2. Staring at the definition seems to imply that the condition on transversal sequences is
arbitrarily weak: Setting ( C)N
tr=∅for all N≥2 is possible, and yields a completely vacuous notion of
pre-category. The point of [15] is that if one strengthens the conditions suitably, then giving a pre- A∞-
category is the same as giving a full A∞-category. We will comment on this later on. In particular, we
will ensure that our definition of transversal sequences is such that it satisfies the condition in [15].
Abouzaid’s exposition [1] exhibits the Fukaya pre-category of a surface with boundary. In particu-
lar, we get from his paper a direct construction of the Fukaya pre-category of a punctured surface, by
interpreting the punctures as boundary circles. We deviate from Abouzaid’s definition by only including
exact Lagrangians in the category. This makes it possible to dispose of the Novikov ring and work over
Cinstead. We are now ready for the first definitions.
Our aim here is to write down the definition of the exact Fukaya pre-category of a punctured surface,
such that it is a pre-category in the sense of Definition 4.1. Before we give the definition, we have to
recall several concepts from [1]: teardrops, spin structures, unobstructed curves, exact curves, transversal
sequences of unobstructed curves, degrees of intersection points, immersed disks between unobstructed
curves, and the Abouzaid sign rule. We recall these terminologies one by one.
Definition 4.3. Ateardrop of a curve X:S1→S\Mis an immersion of the monogon P1intoS\M
which is bounded by a segment of X, such that the corner coming from P1is convex.
A teardrop is depicted in Figure 4.1a. In contrast, an interval winding around a puncture does not
constitute a teardrop. A curve has a teardrop if and only if it contains an interval that is contractible in
S\M.
Definition 4.4. Aspin structure on a curve consists of putting an arbitrary number of “stars” on
distinct points of the curve. We also call these stars the # signs on a curve.

(b) Transversal sequence
Figure 4.2: Transversality
We regard the stars as # signs when we think of them as a negative sign −1. The number of # signs
on a curve is arbitrary, but the resulting isomorphism class of the curve will in fact only depend on the
parity of this number. In other words, zero or one # sign suffice in practice.
Definition 4.5. Anunobstructed curve inS\Mis a smooth closed immersed curve X:S1→S\M
with a choice of spin structure, such that Xis not contractible and does not bound a teardrop.
Let us now recall the notion of exact curves, a subset of the unobstructed curves. Exact curves serve
as objects of the Fukaya (pre-)category. To introduce the notion, put an exact symplectic form ω=dθ
onS\M. The 1-form θis then also referred to as the Liouville form.
Definition 4.6. An unobstructed curve X:S1→S\Misexact ifX∗θis an exact 1-form, in other
words if
∃f:S1→R:X∗θ=d f, orZ
Xθ= 0.
These two conditions are equivalent becauseR
Xθ=R
S1X∗θ. The latter integral vanishes if and only
ifX∗θ∈Ω1(S1) has a primitive f.
Definition 4.7. A sequence ( X1, . . . , X N) of unobstructed curves is transversal if
•Fori < j the curves XiandXjhave only transversal intersection points.
•Fori < j < k the curves Xi, Xj, Xkhave no triple intersection: Xi∩Xj∩Xk=∅.
According to the definition, an unobstructed curve is allowed to intersect itself, just as a self-
intersection of one unobstructed curve Xiis allowed to further intersect with a second unobstructed
curve Xj.
Next, let us recall the degree assigned to an intersection point p∈X1∩X2. The idea is that the
intersection p∈X1∩X2serve as generators of Hom( X1, X2), so we have to assign a degree. Since the
surface Sand the curves X1, X2are oriented, we can distinguish the direction of X1andX2relative
to each other at p. The degree we assign is depicted in Figure 4.3. In that figure, the shaded area has
no meaning in this definition, but indicates for the convenience of the reader how we are going to use
such intersection points as corners of immersed disks. Note that pcan be interpreted both as element of
Hom( X1, X2) and Hom( X2, X1). In fact, it has opposite parity in both hom spaces.
Definition 4.8. Letpbe a transversal intersection point of X1andX2. Then pas morphism from X1
toX2is denoted p:X1→X2. The morphism p:X1→X2is odd if a neighborhood of p∈Scan be
identified in an oriented way with a neighborhood of the origin in R2, mapping X1to the oriented x-axis
andX2to the oriented y-axis. Otherwise pis even.

Figure 4.4: Immersed disks
Let us recall the notion of smooth immersed disks between unobstructed curves. Despite their name,
the disks have corners and are therefore actually polygons. We stick to the classical terminology however.
Recall that PN+1denotes the standard oriented polygon in R2, with indexed N+ 1 clocNwise indexed
edges and N+ 1 indexed corners. The i-th corner lies between the i-th and ( i+ 1)-th edge.
Definition 4.9. LetX1, . . . , X N+1be a transversal sequence of N+ 1≥2 unobstructed curves. Let
p1, . . . , p Nbe a sequence of intersection points pi:Xi→Xi+1and let p∈X1→XN+1be another
intersection point. A smooth immersed disk withinputs p1, . . . , p Nandoutput pconsists of an
orientation-preserving polygon immersion D:PN+1→S\Mup to reparametrization, such that
•the corners of Dare all convex,
•thei-th edge of PN+1lands on Xifor 1≤i≤N+ 1,
•thei-th corner of PN+1lands on pi.
We denote by M(p1, . . . , p N, p) the set of smooth immersed disks with inputs p1, . . . , p Nand output p.
By convexity of the corners, we mean that the image of any interior angle of the polygon is strictly
smaller than half a full turn. Here, an interior angle of the polygon is interpreted as a very small curve
near any corner of PN+1, and a half turn is the natural half turn given by the two sides of the tangent
line of Xiatpi∈S. All this is depicted in Figure 4.4.
Remark 4.10. Regarding the numbering of the disk inputs, we deviate from the Fukaya-theoretic litera-
ture. More precisely, the standard convention [1] is to number the disk inputs in counterclockwise order.
Instead, we number the disk inputs in clockwise order. The difference is necessary in order to match with
the convention for gentle algebras [9].
The orientation of a curve Xiinvolved in a smooth immersed disk Dneed not agree with the orien-
tation of ∂PN+1. We can give the boundary ∂PN+1the orientation pointing in clockwise direction and
distinguish whether Xiagrees with this orientation or not:
Definition 4.11. LetD∈M(p1, . . . , p N, p) be a smooth immersed disk, with pi∈Xi∩Xi+1. Then:
•Xiisoriented clockwise with Dif the orientation of Xiagrees with clockwise orientation of
∂PN+1,
•Xiisoriented counterclockwise with Dif the orientation of Xiis opposite to the clockwise
orientation of ∂PN+1.
The differences in orientation give rise to what we call the Abouzaid sign of the disk. This sign is
taken from [1] and is the surface world incarnation of a sign rule in higher dimensions.
Definition 4.12. LetD∈M(p1, . . . , p N, p) be a smooth immersed disk with inputs pi:Xi→Xi+1and
output p:X1→XN+1. Then the Abouzaid sign Abou( D)∈Z/2Zis the number of indices isuch
34Figure 4.5: Non-exact curves on a torus have endless disks
that piis odd and Xi+1is oriented counterclockwise with D, plus one if pis odd and XN+1is oriented
counterclockwise with D, plus the number of # signs from the spin structure on the boundary of the
disk.
With all devices ready, we can recall the construction of the Fukaya pre-category.
Definition 4.13. Let ( S, M ) be a punctured surface, with exact symplectic form ω=dθ. Then the
exact Fukaya pre-category Fukpre(S, M ) is defined as follows:
•The objects are the exact unobstructed curves in S\Mwith chosen spin structures.
•The set CN
trconsists of the tranversal sequences according to Definition 4.7.
•For transversal X, Y, the hom space Hom( X, Y) is freely spanned over Cby the intersection points
p∈X∩Y:
Hom( X, Y) =M
p∈X∩YCp.
•For any sequence p1, . . . , p Nof intersection points pi:Xi→Xi+1andp:X1→XN+1, the higher
product is defined as
µN(pN, . . . , p 1) =X
p∈X1∩XN+1X
D∈M(p1,...,p N,p)(−1)Abou( D)p.
Theorem 4.14 ([1]).Fukpre(S, M ) is an A∞-pre-category.
Remark 4.15. Spin structures determine the signs in the higher products of the Fukaya category. A spin
structure on a Lagrangian Xcan however also be seen as a special case of local system on X: One bakes
the spin structure into the local system on X. Upon passing to a version of Fukaya category where each
Lagrangian comes with a local system of any dimension assigned, the Fukaya category roughly becomes
closed under taking cones. In fact, taking a cone amounts to adding up the local systems.
Remark 4.16. There are two reasons we only include exact Lagrangians in the Fukaya pre-category.
First, we do not need non-exact curves in this paper at all, since the zigzag curves are already ex-
act. The second reason is due to the Novikov field. Indeed, including non-exact curves allows the set
M(p1, . . . , p N, p) of immersed disks to be infinite which requires the technical insertion of the Novikov
field. The higher product coming from an immersed disk Dthen gets multiplied by the formal power
tω(D), where ω(D) denotes the symplectic area of D. This renders the Fukaya pre-category an A∞-pre-
category over the Novikov field. Since the aim of this paper is to compare the relative Fukaya category to
the gentle algebra defined over C, we have decided to avoid the Novikov field early on. It is an interesting
question what a discrete model would look like for non-exact parts of the relative Fukaya category that
can only be defined with the Novikov field. The discrete model would then need to be defined over the
Novikov field instead of Cand its higher products would need to be defined upon a notion of (algebraic)
symplectic area.
4.2 The exact Fukaya category
In this section, we recall the notion of Fukaya category. We explain how one passes from the pre-category
of the previous section to an actual category. In particular, we intend to make the reader acquainted with
the endomorphism spaces in the Fukaya category and how to extend the A∞-products from transversal
sequences to all sequences of morphisms.
The characteristic property of the Fukaya category is that its transversal part is precisely the Fukaya
pre-category. By transversal parts we mean the following:

The category Dagrees on the transversal part withCifC= (D)tr.
We provide an ad-hoc definition of the Fukaya category as follows:
Definition 4.18. Let ( S, M ) be a punctured surface. Then the exact Fukaya category Fuk(S, M ) is
anyA∞-category which agrees with Fukpre(S, M ) on the transversal part.
Explicit construction of the Fukaya category exist. The standard reference is Seidel’s work [24]. The
idea is to apply Hamiltonian deformations to make nontransversal pairs of Lagrangians transversal. Most
importantly, hom spaces are then also defined for non-transversal pairs. For example, the endomorphism
space End( L) of a Lagrangian Lcontains an identity and a co-identity element, which we may in the
Fukaya category context denote id and id∗. The philosophy is that Hamiltonian deformation of Lyields
a transversal version of L, intersecting precisely twice with L. This is depicted in Figure 4.6.
Remark 4.19. There exist approaches of constructing the Fukaya category from the Fukaya pre-category
by purely categorical methods. In [15], Efimov proved the conjecture attributed to Kontsevich-Soibelman
that every A∞-pre-category is quasi-equivalent to an A∞-category as A∞-pre-categories. The quasi-
equivalence relation for A∞-pre-categories is defined in [15, Definition 2.18/2.19]. For ordinary A∞-
categories, this notion coincides with the ordinary notion of quasi-equivalence.
Efimov’s theorem implies there is an A∞-category quasi-equivalent to Fukpre(S, M ). This A∞-
category in almost but not quite (a model for) the Fukaya pre-category in the sense of Definition 4.18,
since it may have larger hom spaces than the Fukaya pre-category even on the transversal sequences.
The higher products of non-transversal sequences become very difficult to grasp, since multiple Hamil-
tonian deformations may need to be performed on the same Lagrangian in order to make all intersections
transversal. This results in ambiguities, resolved by providing additional deformation data. In summary,
the higher products cannot be determined by simply staring at them. In contrast, our paper provides an
explicit realization also of these higher products on non-transversal sequence, at least on zigzag paths.
For more on exact Fukaya categories, we refer to [7] and [24].
4.3 The relative exact Fukaya pre-category
In this section, we recall the relative exact Fukaya pre-category for punctured surfaces. The starting
point of the relative exact Fukaya pre-category is the exact Fukaya pre-category. The idea is to deform
the products by allowing the disk to cover punctures. The resulting object is what we will call an
A∞-pre-category deformation.
The history of the subject can be traced back fairly accurately: In [23], Seidel introduced the idea of
deforming the Fukaya category by working relative to a divisor. Twenty years later, the relative Fukaya
category was finally constructed in [22]. Its versality as a deformation of the ordinary Fukaya category
was investigated in [25]. Lekili, Perutz and Polishchuk [19, 20] proved deformed mirror symmetry for the
n-punctured torus, apparently the first use of the relative Fukaya category in mirror symmetry.
Definition 4.20. LetCbe an A∞-pre-category and Ba deformation base, e.g. B=CJqK. Then an
A∞-pre-category deformation CqofCis an (infinitesimally curved) and B-linear A∞-pre-category
structure on Bb⊗C. More precisely, this means that Cqhas:
•the same objects as C,
•hom spaces Hom Cq(X, Y) =Bb⊗HomC(X, Y) for X, Y∈ C2

such that µqreduces to µonce the maximal ideal m⊆Bis divided out, and µqsatisfies the curved A∞
relations on transversal sequences.
With this definition in mind, we would like to define the relative version of the Fukaya pre-category.
The idea is to define the higher products by counting smooth immersed disks, which are now also allowed
to cover punctures. By abuse of terminology, we shall keep using the terminology of “smooth immersed
disks” even for those smooth immersed disks which cover punctures:
Definition 4.21. LetX1, . . . , X N+1be a transversal sequence of N+ 1≥2 unobstructed curves. Let
p1, . . . , p Nbe a sequence of intersection points pi:Xi→Xi+1and let p∈X1→XN+1be another
intersection point. A smooth immersed disk withinputs p1, . . . , p Nandoutput pconsists of an
orientation-preserving polygon immersion D:PN+1→Sup to reparametrization, such that
•the corners of Dare all convex,
•thei-th edge of PN+1lands on Xifor 1≤i≤N+ 1,
•thei-th corner of PN+1lands on pi.
We denote by Mq(p1, . . . , p N, p) the set of smooth immersed disks with inputs p1, . . . , p Nand output p.
The deformation base of the relative exact Fukaya pre-category is B=CJMK. This is the power series
ring with one variable for each puncture m∈M. Correspondingly, every puncture q∈Mgiven an element
q∈CJMK. Multiple punctures q1, . . . , q s∈Mcan be multiplied to form the element q1. . . q s∈CJMK.
Definition 4.22. LetD∈Mq(p1, . . . , p N, p). Then the Abouzaid sign Abou( D) is defined precisely
as in Definition 4.12. The q-parameter Punc( D)∈CJMKis defined as the product of all the punctures
reached by the interior of PN+1under D, counting multiplicities.
The parameter Punc( D) is very similar to the deformation parameter in the higher products of Gtl qQ
in section 3.6.
Definition 4.23. Therelative exact Fukaya pre-category relFukpre(S, M ) is the A∞-pre-category
deformation of Fukpre(S, M ) over B=CJMKgiven by the deformed A∞-products on transversal sequences
µN
q(pN, . . . , p 1) =X
p:X1→XN+1X
D∈Mq(p1,...,p N,p)(−1)Abou( D)Punc( D)p.
Checking that relFukpre(S, M ) is really an A∞-pre-category deformation involves two parts. The first
part consists of checking that the higher products µN
qare well-defined. Indeed, exactness guarantees
that the set of disks not covering any puncture is finite, but the case of disks covering some punctures
is non-trivial. A likely successful procedure is as follows: For each monomial q=q1. . . q s∈CJMK, use
exactness of the curves to bound the maximum size of disks that cover precisely the punctures q1, . . . , q s.
A standard argument is then that the Gromov compactness theorem implies the number of disks is finite.
See e.g. [9, Section 6.2.3].
The second check consists of evaluating the A∞-relations on the transversal sequences. This boils down
to re-doing the work of Abouzaid [1], now allowing the disks to cover punctures. The procedure should
be straightforward and conclude that the A∞-relations still hold. In total, this renders relFukpre(S, M )
anA∞-pre-category deformation of Fukpre(S, M ).
4.4 The relative exact Fukaya category
In this section, we recall the notion of relative exact Fukaya category. The starting point is the rel-
ative exact Fukaya pre-category which we sketched in section 4.3. It is an A∞-pre-category deforma-
tion of Fukpre(S, M ). In section 4.2, we have seen that the category Fukpre(S, M ) has a lift to an
actual A∞-category Fuk( S, M ). The question we discuss in this section is what a lift of the deforma-
tion relFukpre(S, M ) to a deformation relFuk( S, M ) of Fuk( S, M ) should look like. Our desired lifting
procedure is best captured graphically as follows:

Definition 4.24. LetCbe an A∞-pre-category and CqanA∞-pre-category deformation. Let Dbe an

(with respect to Cq) is the A∞-pre-category deformation ( Dq)trof (D)trdefined by

We may say that the deformation Dqagrees on the transversal part withCqifCq= (Dq)tr. For
sake of explicitness in section 9.6, we provide the following terminology:
Definition 4.25. LetCandDbeA∞-pre-categories and CqandDqbeA∞-pre-category deformations.
Then a strict isomorphism Fq:Cq→ D qofA∞-pre-category deformations consists of
•a bijection Fq: ObC → ObDsuch that

We provide an ad-hoc definition of the relative Fukaya category as follows:
Definition 4.26. Let (S, M ) be a punctured surface. Then the relative Fukaya category relFuk( S, M )
is any A∞-deformation of Fuk( S, M ) such that relFuk( S, M )tr= relFukpre(S, M ).
Remark 4.27. Sheridan and Perutz [22] provide explicit constructions of relative Fukaya categories.
Remark 4.28. All concrete models of the Fukaya category give rise to a priori different notions of relative
Fukaya category. It should be possible to show that these are in fact all isomorphic.
4.5 Zigzag paths as Lagrangians
In the present section, we show how to interpret zigzag paths as objects in Fukaya categories. The starting
point is a dimer Q. It gives rise to a collection of zigzag paths and we show how to turn them into curves
in|Q|which we call “zigzag curves”. We recall how to make these curves objects of the relative Fukaya
pre-category and look at their hom spaces and higher products. The material can also be found in [14,
Chapter 10].
The Fukaya category of a dimer is simply defined as the Fukaya category of its underlying punctured
surface. More precisely, let Qbe a dimer. Then Qincludes the datum of a punctured surface ( |Q|, Q0)
and we write
FukpreQ= Fukpre(|Q|, Q0), FukQ= Fuk( |Q|, Q0),
relFukpreQ= relFukpre(|Q|, Q0),relFuk Q= Fuk( |Q|, Q0).
The first step in this section is to turn zigzag paths into curves. Let Lbe a zigzag path in Q.
Then Lconsists by definition of a path . . . a 1a0a−1. . .of composable arcs in Q, together with left/right
indications. The idea to produce a curve ˜L⊆ |Q|\Q0from Lis to stitch together the arcs aiin sequence,
minding the left/right indication. The precise definition reads as follows:
Definition 4.29. LetQbe a dimer and La zigzag path in Q. Then the associated zigzag curve
˜L:S1→S\Mis defined by connecting the midpoints of the arcs . . . , a −1, a0, a1, . . .by means of the
angle cutting procedure :
•IfLturns left at index i, then the midpoint of aiis connected to the midpoint of ai+1by turning
clockwise around the puncture h(ai) =t(ai+1).

Figure 4.7: Zigzag path and zigzag curve
•IfLturns right at index i, then the midpoint of aiis connected to the midpoint of ai+1by turning
counterclockwise around the puncture h(ai) =t(ai+1).
The connecting arc between the midpoints of aiandai+1is to be chosen close enough to the puncture
that it does not intersect with the zigzag curves associated with the other zigzag paths.
In Figure 4.7, we have depicted a zigzag path together with its associated zigzag curve. By definition
of˜L, we have the freedom to deform ˜La bit near the punctures. We quote the following lemma from
[14] which claims that a small deformation can be chosen in such a way that that ˜Lbecomes an exact
Lagrangian. The condition is that the Liouville form αnear the punctures takes the shape α=dθ/r
where ris the distance from the puncture and θthe polar angle.
Lemma 4.30 ([14, Lemma 10.6]) .LetQbe a dimer. Pick a symplectic form ω=dαon|Q| \Q0such
thatα=dθ/r near the punctures. Then the curve ˜L:S1→ |Q| \Q0can be constructed in such a way
that it is exact with respect to ω.
Zigzag curves in a general dimer are not contractible and do not bound teardrops in |Q| \Q0. If
Qis geometrically consistent, then even in the closed surface |Q|a zigzag curve is not contractible and
does not bound a teardrop. Upon specification of spin structures and a symplectic form, the zigzag
curves ˜Ldefine object of the exact Fukaya category Fuk Q. In analogy to the “category of zigzag paths”
constructed combinatorially via Gtl qQin section 7, we may give the subcategory of relFuk Qconsisting
of these objects a name:
Definition 4.31. LetQbe a geometrically consistent dimer. Pick a choice of spin structure for every
zigzag curve in Q. Then we denote by
FukpreQ|ObL,FukQ|ObL,relFukpreQ|ObL,relFuk Q|ObL
the subcategories of the (relative) Fukaya (pre-)categories given by the zigzag curves with chosen spin
structure.
An intersection between two zigzag paths shall be defined as a shared arc of the two zigzag paths.
More precisely, we use the following terminology:
Definition 4.32. LetQbe a dimer and L1, L2be two zigzag paths. An (indexed) intersection
between L1andL2is a pair ( ai, bj) such that
•aiis an indexed arc of L1,
•bjis an indexed arc of L2,
•ai=bjas arcs in Q,
•L1turns left at aiandL2turns right at bj, or the other way around.
Remark 4.33. The cautious wording of Definition 4.32 is necessary in order to make a transversal
self-intersection count double.
In Lemma 4.34, we explain that intersections between two distinct zigzag curves ˜L1and ˜L2are
precisely the same as (indexed) intersections between L1andL2. This is depicted in Figure 4.8. In
particular, the hom spaces of FukpreQ|ObLcan be identified with spans of (indexed) intersections of
zigzag paths. To make this work also in case L1=L2, we have to use a model for the Fukaya category as
discussed in section 4.2, in which also the endomorphism spaces are spanned by transversal intersections,
plus an identity and a co-identity morphism.
Lemma 4.34. LetQbe a dimer and L1, L2be two zigzag paths. Then transversal intersections points
of˜L1and˜L2, counting transversal self-intersections double if L1=L2, are in one-to-one correspondence
with indexed intersections between L1andL2. Therefore:
Hom FukQ(˜L1,˜L2) = spanC{intersections ( a, b) ofL1, L2}[⊕Cid⊕Cid∗ifL1=L2]. (4.1)

Figure 4.9: Illustration of zigzag curves
Proof. The one-to-one correspondence is a simple inspection. It is worth noting that a transversal self-
intersection gives rise to two intersection points between ˜L1and˜L2, according to the double counting,
and two indexed intersections between L1andL2.
The description of the hom space (4.1) for L1̸=L2follows from the definition of FukpreQand the
requirement that (Fuk Q)tr= FukpreQ. For L1=L2, (4.1) follows from our choice for Fuk Q, which
describes endomorphism spaces as spans of transversal intersection points plus identity and co-identity.
This finishes the proof.
The zigzag curves automatically become objects in the relative Fukaya pre-category and the relative
Fukaya category, by virtue of Definition 4.18 and 4.26. If we choose Fuk Qsuch that the endomorphism
spaces are spanned by transversal intersections plus identity and co-identity, then we know the hom
spaces of relFuk Q:
Lemma 4.35. LetQbe a dimer. Then relFuk Qis an A∞-deformation of Fuk Q. Let L1, L2be two
zigzag paths. Then
Hom relFuk Q(˜L1,˜L2) =Bb⊗span{intersections ( a, b) ofL1, L2}[⊕Bid⊕Bid∗ifL1=L2].
Proof. By virtue of Definition 4.26, relFuk Qis an A∞-deformation of Fuk Q. In particular, its hom
spaces are given by
Hom relFuk Q(˜L1,˜L2) =Bb⊗Hom FukQ(˜L1,˜L2).
Using the combinatorical description of Hom FukQ(L1, L2) from Lemma 4.34 finishes the proof.
Among zigzag curves, it is easy to describe the transversal sequences:
Lemma 4.36. LetQbe a dimer and L1, . . . , L N+1be a sequence of N+ 1≥1 zigzag paths in Q. Then
the sequence of zigzag curves ( ˜L1, . . . , ˜LN+1) is transversal if and only if the zigzag paths Liare pairwise
distinct.
40Proof. Assume ( ˜L1, . . . , ˜LN+1) is a transversal sequence. By definition, ˜Liand ˜Ljfori < j only have
transversal intersection points. Then in particular ˜Li̸=˜Lj, hence Li̸=Ljas zigzag paths. Conversely,
assume all zigzag paths are pairwise distinct. Then for i < j the zigzag curves ˜Liand ˜Ljhave only
transversal intersection points. Moreover, for i < j < k the zigzag curves ˜Li,˜Ljand˜Lkhave no common
intersection point at all, since an intersection point of zigzag curves is shared between at most two zigzag
curves. This shows that ( ˜L1, . . . , ˜LN+1) is a transversal sequence according to Definition 4.7 and finishes
the proof.
We can compute some A∞-products in the category of zigzag curves relFuk Q|ObL⊆relFuk Q. Let
p1, . . . , p Nbe intersection points with pi:˜Li→˜Li+1. If ( ˜L1, . . . , ˜LN+1) is a transversal sequence,
then the product µrelFuk Q(pN, . . . , p 1) agrees with the product of the relative Fukaya pre-category, which
is by definition enumerated by smooth immersed disks with inputs p1, . . . , p Nand arbitrary output
p:˜L1→˜LN+1.
Example 4.37. In Figure 4.9a, we have depicted a 16-punctured torus dimer. There are 8 zigzag paths
and zigzag curves, depicted in Figure 4.9b. A sample smooth immersed disk bounded by four zigzag
curves is depicted in Figure 4.9c. In the figure, we have denoted the four involved zigzag curves by ˜L1,
˜L2,˜L3,˜L4. The disk has
inputs p1:˜L1→˜L2, p 2:˜L2→˜L3, p 3:˜L3→˜L4, output p:˜L1→˜L4.
The inputs p1is odd, and the inputs p2, p3are even. The output pis even. It covers six punctures which
we denote by q1, . . . , q 6. The contribution of this smooth immersed disk to µ3(p3, p2, p1) is then
±q1q2q3q4q5q6p.
Remark 4.38. When p1, . . . , p Nare morphisms pi∈Hom FukQ(˜Li,˜Li+1) and the sequence ( ˜L1, . . . , ˜LN+1)
is not transversal, then the product µrelFuk Q(pN, . . . , p 1) is unpredictable. In the present paper, we define
a category H Lq⊆H Tw Gtl qQwhich has the property that its transversal part agrees with relFukpre|ObL.
The products of H Lqare explicitly constructed in section 9. They provide a candidate for describing the
products among non-transversal sequences in relFuk Q|ObL.
It seems likely that H Lqis (gauge equivalent to) relFuk Q|ObL(for any model of relFuk Q). Our main
result is however no guarantee for this, since relFuk Qis defined as a lift of the entire relative pre-category
and taking subcategories and lifting pre-categories to categories need not commute: Every subcategory
of a lift is a lift of the subcategory, but not the other way around.
Combining Definition 4.23, Definition 4.26, Lemma 4.34 and Lemma 4.36, we summarize our findings
as follows:
Corollary 4.39. LetQbe a dimer. Then the A∞-pre-category FukpreQ|ObLand its A∞-pre-category

•The objects are the zigzag curves ˜Lfor all zigzag paths L, with chosen spin structure.
•The set of transversal sequences is

415 Uncurving of strings and bands
In this section, we show how to remove curvature of band objects in derived deformed gentle algebras.
The aim is to find the uncurvable objects of Tw Gtl qAaccording to the uncurving theory presented in
[18]. We start by recalling how objects of Tw Gtl Acan be classified geometrically as strings and bands,
due to [16]. All objects of Tw Gtl Acan naturally be interpreted as objects in Tw Gtl qA. However,
they do not satisfy the Maurer-Cartan equation of Tw Gtl qAitself and become curved objects. In the
present section, we introduce a method to reduce curvature of these curved objects, which we call the
“complementary angle trick”.
Band object
(X, δ)∈Tw Gtl ACurved object
(X, δ)∈Tw Gtl qAUncurved object
(X, δq)∈Tw′GtlqAupon deformation uncurving
We show that the complementary angle trick succeeds in removing curvature from band objects which
satisfy a technical condition. Subsequently, we show how to drop this condition. While not an ideal term,
we will constantly refer to removing curvature as “uncurving”. The starting point is a full arc system
with [NMDC]. We find that uncurvability differs between band objects and string objects and depends
also on the topology of the objects. Our findings can be summarized as follows:
•Uncurvability of band objects: Our main criterion states that a band object can be uncurved in
case the underlying curve, regarded as a curve in S, is not contractible and does not include a
teardrop.
•Uncurvability of string objects: The general rule is that string objects cannot be uncurved. There
are exceptions, for example a string where both ends touch each other may be uncurvable if the
deformation parameter lies in m2.
5.1 Strings and bands
In this section, we recall the classification of objects in H Tw Gtl A. This classification is due to Haiden,
Katzarkov and Kontsevich and categorizes the objects into two classes, the so-called string and band
objects. Roughly speaking, a string object is a non-closed curve running between two punctures of A
and a band object is a closed curve that avoids the punctures of A. In the present section, we recall the
precise classification and how to realize string and band objects explicitly as twisted complexes.
Originally, the gentle algebra Gtl Awas introduced in [9] to provide a combinatorial description of the
wrapped Fukaya category of S\M. It was shown in that paper’s appendix that Gtl Aindeed embeds into
wFuk( S\M). The question arose whether this embedding is essentially surjective, upon passing to the
derived category H Tw Gtl A. If one puts suitable restrictions on the geometry of the objects allowed in
wFuk( S\M) and works with a Z-grading, the embedding is indeed essentially surjective. The fact that
an arc system suffices to generate the wrapped Fukaya category has apparently been folklore for longer,
and was affirmed by Haiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich [16].
Until now, we have defined Gtl Aas aZ/2Z-graded A∞-category. In order to state and discuss the
classification of objects, we need to recall Z-gradings GtlZAon Gtl A. The procedure to upgrade Gtl A
to aZ-graded A∞-category GtlZAis as follows: Choose a line field on the surface S, with singularities
allowed at the punctures. Choose a grading of the arcs a∈ Arelative to the line field. Define the degree
of an angle α:a→bas the rounding off of the amount it turns relative to the grading of aandb.
A precise description of this procedure, including definitions of the notions of line field, arc grading,
degree of an angle can be found in [16]. With this in mind, we are ready to recall the classification of
objects.
Theorem 5.1 ([16]).LetAbe a full arc system with [NMD]. Up to isomorphism, the objects of
H Tw GtlZAcan be classified as direct sums of the following:
•String objects: graded curves in S, starting and ending at two punctures, but otherwise avoiding
punctures and not bounding a teardrop in S\M. The curve is to be considered up to homotopy,
keeping endpoints fixed.
•Band objects: closed graded curves in Swith indecomposable local system, avoiding punctures
and not bounding a teardrop in S\M. The curve is to be considered up to homotopy and the local
system up to isomorphism.
An example string and band object are depicted in Figure 5.1. Actual representatives of string and
band objects as twisted complexes in H Tw GtlZAcan be provided by an explicit construction, which we

now describe in some detail. The input datum of both constructions is a graded curve of one of the two
types above.
A string object can be constructed by approximating the curve by a sequence of arcs a1, . . . , a k, and
adding up these arcs to form a twisted complex
(a1[s1]⊕. . .⊕ak[sk], δ)∈Tw GtlZA.
The shifts si∈Zare defined such that the degree of ai[si] with respect to the line field equals the inherent
grading of the curve. Let us explain how δis found: At every endpoint between two consecutive arcs
ai, ai+1of the sequence, determine whether the curve runs to the left or to the right of the puncture.
The curve either follows an angle ai→ai+1or an angle ai+1→ai. Insert this angle into the δmatrix.
Possibly, the order of the arcs as summands of the twisted complex needs to be reordered to make δ
upper triangular. In summary, the δmatrix indicates how the arcs a1, . . . , a kare stitched together. The
procedure is depicted in Figure 5.2.
Remark 5.2. Let us record the following properties: The twisted differential δautomatically becomes
homogeneous of degree 1 due to the chosen shifts si. Identity angles αiare not allowed, and can in
fact be avoided when choosing the approximation by arcs. Two consecutive angles αi, αi+1are never
composable because they turn around the opposite ends of their common arc. One might wonder about
composability in case this arc is a loop. Indeed the two consecutive angles may be composable in Gtl A,
but are not composable in the order enforced by the ordering on the angles in the twisted complex.
Band objects can be constructed in a fashion similar to strings. In contrast to strings, their ends are
however also stitched together by an angle, and the local system is manifested in the δmatrix. Let us
explain these steps in more detail.
•Insert not only the angles between two consecutive arcs aiandai+1, but also the angle between
the last arc akand the first arc a1into the δmatrix. Reorder the arcs to make δupper triangular.
In contrast to the case of strings, such a reordering need not exist. This happens if all arcs are
connected entirely cyclically. Abort in this case, and approximate the curve by a different sequence
of arcs. It is shown below that this is possible, without inserting identities into δ.
•The shifts are chosen such that δhas degree 1. In contrast to strings which have an entry less in
their δmatrix, it requires a check that this can be done in a consist manner. After walking around
the curve one full cycle, do we end up with the same degree shift as we started with? The answer
is yes, and the reason is that the curve was required to be graded with respect to the line field.
•If the local system is of dimension d >1, duplicate all arcs in the twisted complex so that each arc
appears dtimes. Also duplicate the angles so each angle appears dtimes, running between the i-th
copy of some arc and the i-th copy of the next (without running from one copy to the other).
•If the local system is non-trivial, represent it as a matrix M= (mpq)∈Cd×dand insert it into the
δmatrix as follows: Choose two consecutive arcs ai, ai+1in the representation of the curve by arcs.

Then change the δentry running from the q-th copy of aito the p-th copy of ai+1tompq. For
instance in case d= 2, the part of δmatrix between aiandai+1shall look like

m11αim12αi
m21αim22αi
.
This overwrites the default identity matrix at those entries written to δin step (2). In case the
angle between aianai+1runs from ai+1toaiinstead, use the inverse of Minstead of Mitself. It
does not matter which pair of consecutive arcs is chosen. In fact, Mcould be arbitrarily factorized
into matrices, one for each pair of consecutive arcs, and the values could be written to δper pair.
It does not matter which factorization we choose: The isomorphism class of the resulting object in
H Tw GtlZAonly depends on the product of the factors.
Lemma 5.3. LetAbe a full arc system with [NMD]. Then every string and band has an approximation
by arcs where no angle is an identity and all arcs can be ordered such that δis upper triangular.
Proof. First, choose some arbitrary approximation of the curve such that no connecting angle is the
identity. This is always possible. The rest of the proof consists of tweaking this approximation such that
δbecomes upper triangular.
For strings, there is always an ordering of the arcs in which δis upper triangular, and we are done.
For bands however, such an ordering need not exist. That is, the arcs might be connected cyclically. The
remaining task in this proof is to break the cyclicity in the band case by tweaking the arc collection.
We may assume that one of the angles αiconsists of at least three indecomposable components.
Otherwise, choose a different approximation by arcs where one angle winds a little more around some
puncture.
Regard such an angle αithat consists of at least three indecomposable components, and split it into
a product αi=α3

an interior angle of some polygon. We now modify the angle sequence α1, . . . , α kby flipping αiover to
the opposite side of this polygon, see Figure 5.3. This tweak yields a non-cyclic approximation where all
angles are still non-empty.
Let us discuss this classification in the context of the grading question. What are the objects up to
isomorphism of H Tw Gtl A? Here Gtl Aand its twisted completion are taken as usual with Z/2Z-grading.
The answer is, there are both more and less objects. For example, twisted complexes differing only by
even shifts are unequal in the Z-grading, but are identified in the Z/2Z-grading. On the other hand,
some twisted complexes that can be made with respect to the Z/2Z-grading cannot be constructed in
theZ-grading. One might say, the Z/2Z-graded H Tw Gtl Acategory contains all objects of H Tw GtlZA
for every possible Z-grading, plus additional objects that cannot be obtained from a Z-graded version,
modulo identifying objects differing by shifts. This is depicted in the overview Figure 5.4. We are however
not aware of a concise classification of the objects of H Tw Gtl A.
44A broad class of objects in H Tw Gtl Acan however be constructed by forming Z/2Z-graded strings
and bands, corresponding to curves on Swithout grading requirements. Let us define what we mean by
this:
•Z/2Z-graded string objects: Stitch arcs together as in the Z-graded case, and shift arcs with
si∈Z/2Zsuch that the degree of δis odd.
•Z/2Z-graded band objects: Stitch arcs together as in the Z-graded case, shift arcs with si∈Z/2Z
such that the degree of δis odd. The shifts are consistent: After cycling around the curve once, we
end up with the same shift because the curve is orientable.
5.2 Complementary angle trick
In this section, we introduce a method to uncurve objects of Tw Gtl qA. The starting point is the
classification of objects in Tw Gtl Arecalled in section 5.1. The idea to uncurve these objects is to
infinitesimally deform their δ-matrix by inserting infinitesimal multiples of the complements of the angles
already present in the δ-matrix. We therefore call this method the “complementary angle trick”. In the
present section, we show that this trick successfully uncurves Z/2Z-graded band objects under certain
conditions.
We will start the setup in a slightly more general approach: We take Ato denote a full arc system
with [NMDC] and we take the category Gtl rAto be the associated deformed gentle algebra constructed
in [10]. This deformed gentle algebra depends on a parameter
r=r01 +X
q∈M
n≥1rq,nℓn
q∈mZ(GtlA).
Here Bis a chosen deformation base with maximal ideal m. We say that riswithout 1-component if
r0= 0. For simplicity, we write µqfor the product of Gtl rA.
Example 5.4. The category Gtl rAmay simply be the standard deformation Gtl rA= Gtl qAover
B=CJMK, detailed in section 3.6. It is determined by the specific parameter
r=X
q∈Mqℓq∈(M)Z(GtlA).
This parameter is without 1-component.
Recall the notion of uncurvability: Let Cbe an A∞-category and Cqa deformation of C. Then an
object X∈ Cqis uncurvable if there is an odd S∈mEndC(X) such that µ0
q,X+µ1
q(S)+µ2
q(S, S)+. . .= 0.
For twisted complexes X= (PXi[si], δ), this means to find an infinitesimal deformation δqofδsuch
that the curvature of the twisted complex becomes zero:
µ0
q,X+µ1
Add Gtl rA(δq) +µ2
Add Gtl rA(δq, δq) +. . .= 0.
The infinitesimal part of δqis allowed to lie anywhere in the matrix, not restricted to the upper-triangular
part.
Let us now describe our “complementary angle trick”. Regard a band object X= (a1[s1]⊕. . . , δ ). To
simplify the discussion, we assume its local system is one-dimensional with transition value simply equal
to 1. In the twisted complex X, every arc then only appears once (apart from arcs appearing multiple
times in the approximation), and every angle αiappearing in δappears with a coefficient of +1.
The curvature µ0
q,XofXconsists by definition of the sum of the curvatures µ0
aiof the constituent arcs
ofX. Since we are regarding a standard deformation Gtl rAof Gtl A, we know this curvature explicitly:
Every arc carries an infinitesimal amount of turns around both of its endpoints as curvature. Since Xis
a band object, both endpoints of every arc aiare connected to the predecessor or successor arc ai−1and
aiby angles αi.
The trick to uncurving is to add the complements α′
iof these angles to the δmatrix, depicted in
Figure 5.5c. Generically denote by ℓa full turn around any puncture. We denote by rℓ−1α′
ithe element
ofBb⊗GtlAobtained from rby extracting the part that winds around the same puncture as α′
i, shortening
all angles by one full turn, and multiplying by α′
i. Naturally, the element rℓ−1α′
ican be interpreted as
an odd morphism lying in Hom Add Gtl rA(X, X ).
45Definition 5.5. LetAbe a full arc system with [NMDC], Ba deformation base and r∈mZ(GtlA) a
parameter without 1-component. Regard a band object X= (a1[s1]⊕. . . , δ ) with trivial 1-dimensional
local system. Assume its δ-angles α1, . . . , α kare all shorter than a full turn and not identities. Then the
complementary angle trick associates to Xthe twisted complex ( a1[s1]⊕. . . , δ q)∈Tw′GtlqAwith
δqgiven by
δq:=δ+δ′=kX
i=1αi+rℓ−1α′
i.
Example 5.6. Regard the deformation Gtl rAwith parameter r=qℓpoverB=CJqK, with ℓpdenoting
the central element consisting of single turns around the puncture p. Then the deformation entry added
to the δmatrix is simply rℓ−1α′
i=qα′
ifor every αiwhich winds around p.
Remark 5.7. The deformation of δtoδqhappens precisely on the opposite side of the diagonal of the
matrix: If αiis in the δmatrix as angle from aitoai+1, then the angle rℓ−1α′
iis inserted within the
δmatrix as morphism from ai+1toαi. Ifαiwas an angle from ai+1toai, then rℓ−1α′
iis inserted as
morphism from aitoai+1. This way we obtain a matrix δqwith an infinitesimal lower-triangular part.
Remark 5.8. The complementary angle trick also works when the local system is higher-dimensional
and non-trivial. Recall that the δmatrix encodes the transition matrix Mof a higher-dimensional local
system by carrying its entries mpqin front of the αimorphism from the q-th copy of aito the p-th copy
ofai+1. In case the angle runs in the opposite direction, the δmatrix encodes Mby carrying the entries
mpq:= (M−1)pqof the inverse matrix.
In order to uncurve this band object, we include the inverse matrix M−1in the uncurving deformation
ofδ, orMin case the angle runs in opposite direction. For instance if d= 2 and αiruns from aitoai+1,
the part of the δqmatrix between aiandai+1shall read
part of δq=
m11αim12αi
m21αim22αi
m11rℓ−1α′
im12rℓ−1α′
i
m21rℓ−1α′
im22rℓ−1α′
i
.
We are now ready to check that the complementary angle trick succeeds in uncurving band objects.
The trick however comes with strict conditions. We use the following terminology:
Definition 5.9. Anindexed arc onXis one of the arcs aiofX, remembering the index i. Ansegment
of indexed arcs on Xis a sequence of consecutive arcs ai, ai+1, . . . , a i+j, remembering the indices. An
indexed segment is contractible in Sif it returns to the same puncture as it started from and the loop
defined this way is contractible in the closed surface S.
Remark 5.10. A band object which bounds a teardrop in Sis depicted in Figure 5.5a. Meanwhile, the
shape depicted in Figure 5.5b does not constitute a teardrop. A contractible segment of indexed arcs is
depicted in Figure 5.5d. The existence of a contractible segment of arcs on Xdoes not imply that the
underlying curve of Xhas a teardrop.
As we shall see in Lemma 5.11, the complementary angle trick succeeds in uncurving X∈Tw Gtl rA
when we assume the following three conditions on X:
•The underlying curve of X, regarded as a curve in the closed surface S, is not contractible and does
not bound a teardrop.
•All angles αiin the δmatrix are non-identities and strictly smaller than a full turn.
•No segment of indexed arcs of Xis contractible.
In Appendix B, we explain how to abandon the condition that segments of indexed arcs are not
contractible. Without the condition, one has to add further angles to δqfor every location where Xcomes
close to itself, other than only the complementary angles α′
i. It is interesting to note that geometrically
these additional angles can be interpreted as “complementary to segments of indexed arcs” of X.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that Xhas one-dimensional local system and all transition
values in δare 1. The case with contractible segments is dealt with in Appendix B. We shall therefore
assume that Xhas no contractible segments of indexed arcs.
Now let us prove that the complementary angle trick successfully uncurves X. This entails checking
that the curvature of ( ⊕ai[si], δq)∈Tw′GtlrAvanishes. Explicitly, the curvature is
X
k≥0µk
Add Gtl rA(δq, . . . , δ k).
The summand at k= 0 is the curvature µ0
X,q, explicitly the sum of the curvatures of the individual arcs.
Note that µ1
qvanishes due to [NMDC]. In the first step of the proof, we show that µ0
X,qprecisely cancels
µ2
Add Gtl rA(δq, δq). In the second step of the proof, we show that all the higher terms µ≥3
q(δq, . . .) vanish.
Let us analyze µ2
q(δq, δq). Since δq=δ+δ′is the sum of the original δand the modification δ′due
to the complementary angle trick, we need to check the original part µ2
q(δ, δ) and the new components
µ2
q(δ, δ′),µq(δ′, δ) and µ2
q(δ′, δ′). Recall also that the product µ2
qis not deformed: It is merely the B-linear
extension of the original µ2by assumption of [NMDC]. As observed in Remark 5.2, we have µ2
q(δ, δ) = 0.
Similarly, there are no products of complementary angles possible, so µ2
q(δ′, δ′) = 0.
Meanwhile, we have
µ2
Add Gtl rA(δ, δ′) =kX
i=1−αirℓ−1α′
i=−r∈mZ(GtlA),
where ron the right-hand side is interpreted as linear combination of powers of full turns starting at
those arc ends of the arc approximation where the angles αienter. The minus sign comes from the sign
convention for Add Gtl rA. Similarly,
µ2
Add Gtl rA(δ, δ′) =kX
i=1−rℓ−1α′
iαi=−r∈mZ(GtlA),
where ron the right-hand side is interpreted as linear combination of powers of full turns starting at
those arc ends of the arc approximation where the angles αileave.
We have used that all angles in the twisted differential of Xare non-identities and shorter than
full turns: Identities would give extra terms in the products µ2(δ, δ′) and µ2(δ′, δ). Moreover, taking
complementary angles is only possible if all angles in Xare at most full turns. A precise full turn would
in turn give an identity in δ′, hence an undesired contribution to e.g. µ2(δ′, δ). In short, we assumed just
the right condition so that nothing but the right terms appears in µ2(δq, δq). We conclude
µ0
X,q+µ2
Add Gtl rA(δq, δq) = 0 .
For the second step of the proof, we show that µk≥3
q(δq, . . . , δ q) = 0. Assume Dis an orbigon contributing
to this product. Then the boundary of Dis a contractible indexed segment of X, in contradiction to
the assumption that there are no contractible indexed segments. This shows that µk≥3
q(δq, . . . , δ q) = 0.
Finally, we conclude that the curvature of the deformed twisted complex Xq= (⊕ai[si], δq) vanishes.
This finishes the proof.
5.3 The uncurvable objects
In this section, we show that most band objects in Tw Gtl qAare uncurvable. The starting point is
the classification of band objects recalled in section 5.1 and the complementary angle trick defined in

representation when the 4-gon is divided into triangles.
section 5.2. The goal is to show that a band object is uncurvable if its underlying curve in Sis topologically
nontrivial and does not bound a teardrop. We have already shown in Lemma 5.11 that the complementary
angle trick succeeds in uncurving these objects under the technical condition that all angles in the δ-
matrix of Xare non-identities and shorter than full turns. In the present section, we show how to abandon
this technical condition.
Our starting point is again a full arc system Awith [NMDC] and a deformation Gtl rAwith r∈
mZ(GtlA) a deformation parameter without 1-component. It is our wish to apply the complementary
angle trick to every band object whose underlying curve in Sis topologically nontrivial and does not
bound a teardrop. Combining Remark 2.18 and Lemma 5.11, we would be done if every such band object
has a twisted complex representation where all angles are non-identities and shorter than full turns. This
is however not the case:
Remark 5.12. There are arc systems in which some bands fail to have representatives which satisfy
the requirements of Lemma 5.11. For example, regard the 1-punctured torus with two arcs depicted in
Figure 5.6. Its horizontal, or vertical, band cannot be represented as a twisted complex with all angles
non-identities and shorter than a full turn. As soon as we divide the 4-gon into two triangles, the band
suddenly has a desired representation.
There are however arc systems which guarantee the existence of representatives suitable for Lemma 5.11
for every band object whose underlying curve in Sis topologically nontrivial and does not bound a
teardrop. Following Remark 5.12, the idea is to simply require that the arc system contains only of
triangles:
Lemma 5.13. LetAbe a full arc system with [NMDC] and assume all polygons in Aare triangles. Let
X∈H Tw Gtl Abe a string or band object whose underlying curve in Sis nontrivial and does not bound
a teardrop. Then Xhas a twisted complex representation in which all angles αiare non-identities and
shorter than a full turn.
Proof. We proceed as in the proof of Lemma 5.3, and go a little further. Let us repeat the steps: Choose
an initial approximation of Xby arcs aisuch all angles αiare non-identities and strictly shorter than
a full turn. The rest of the proof is concerned with tweaking the approximation so as to make δupper
triangular. In case of a string object, we are done. Let us inspect the given arc collection α1, . . . , α kwith
its connecting angles α1, . . . , α k. By assumption, all angles αigo from arc aitoai+1, or all the other
way around. Let us assume the former is the case: that αiruns from aitoai+1. Moreover, any pair of
consecutive arcs αi, αi+1runs at opposite ends of the arc ai+1, and all are non-identities.
Our strategy to break cyclicity is to pull some consecutive arcs with their angles following the interior
of a polygon to the opposite side of the polygon. Let us make this concrete and distinguish the following
hierarchy of cases: (a) there is an angle αiwith at least three indecomposable components, (b) k= 1,
(c) there are two consecutive decomposable angles, (d) k= 2, (e) one angle αiis indecomposable. By
this hierarchy of cases, we mean that case (b) shall include that (a) does not hold; (c) shall include that
(a) and (b) do not hold, etc. Samples for all cases are depicted in Figure 5.7.
Regard case (a). Then we can flip a part of αito the other side of a triangle.
Regard case (b). If α1has just one indecomposable component, we have an immediate contradiction.
Ifα1has two indecomposable components, then the arc in the middle of α1appears twice in the triangle,
with equal orientation. This is also a contradiction, since the triangle is then not embedded anymore: In
Figure 5.7, the two dots inside the triangle would need to be equal, rendering the triangle non-embedded.
Regard case (c). Regard two consecutive decomposable angles αiandαi+1. Then the last indecom-
posable part of αiand the first indecomposable part of αi+1are interior angles of a triangle. We can now
flip these parts of the angles to the opposite side of the triangle. As depicted in the figure, this suffices
to break cyclicity.
Regard case (d). It is impossible that both α1andα2are indecomposable. Indeed, this would mean
that the curve partially winds around the interior of a triangle. Since we are excluding case (c), we can

assume that α1is indecomposable and α2consists of two indecomposable parts. Then α2crosses both
the head and the tail side of some arc, which is impossible.
Regard case (e). Let αibe the indecomposable angle and regard αi−1as well as αi+1. Since the curve
does not bound a teardrop, the angle αi−1enters the polygon from outside and αi+1leaves the triangle.
In other words, both are longer than the preceding and succeeding interior angles of the triangle. The
tweak we apply to the angle sequence is to cut away the parts of αi−1andαi+1lying inside the triangle
and deleting αi. A shorter sequence remains to be dealt with.
In every step, the angles that are already present become only shorter. Moreover, all angles that are
inserted new in a step are interior angles of a polygon by choice. Since all polygons in Aare triangles
and all arcs in Aare non-contractible in S, all interior angles are shorter than a full turn. In total, we
end up with an approximation where all angles are non-identities and shorter than full turns, as well as
δbeing upper triangular.
Theorem 5.14. LetAbe a full arc system with [NMDC]. Let r∈mZ(GtlA) be a deformation parameter
without 1-component. Then all Z/2Z-graded band objects whose underlying curves in Sare topologically
nontrivial and do not bound a teardrop are uncurvable.
Proof. The proof consists of two steps. The first is to observe that we have already proven the case when
all polygons in Aare triangles. The second is to extend to the general case.
For the first step, let us assume that all polygons in Aare triangles. Then by Lemma 5.13, the band
object Xhas a twisted complex representation where all angles are non-identities and shorter than full
turns. By Lemma 5.11, the complementary angle trick now successfully removes the curvature of X.
For the second step, cut all polygons that are not triangles yet into pieces by adding arcs. Let us
denote the resulting marked surface with arc system by A′. We have an embedding Gtl A ⊆ GtlA′, and
correspondingly
i: Tw Gtl A ⊆ Tw Gtl A′.
It is well-known that this map is actually a quasi-equivalence, see [9]. The reason is that all additional
arcs of A′can be built up to quasi-isomorphism as twisted complexes of arcs in A. Correspondingly, we
also have a quasi-isomorphism
π: Tw Gtl A′→Tw Gtl A
that sends an object i(X) to some object π(i(X)) quasi-isomorphic to X. Now choose Xto be a
band object as in the hypothesis, i.e. topologically nontrivial in Sand not bounding a teardrop. Then
i(X)∈Tw Gtl A′is uncurvable by the first step of the proof. According to Remark 2.18, also π(i(X)) is
uncurvable. Since Xitself is quasi-isomorphic to π(i(X)), it is uncurvable as well by Remark 2.18. This
finishes the proof.
Remark 5.15. Let us get back to the 1-punctured torus with two arcs of Remark 5.12. We have seen
that the horizontal band has no twisted complex representation that is suitable for the uncurving trick.
According to Theorem 5.14, it can be uncurved nevertheless and by Remark 2.18 this must in fact be
possible for every chosen twisted complex representation.
Denote the angles in the 1-punctured torus by α,β,γ,δas in Figure 5.6. Pick the twisted complex
representation

0 γ id
−qβαδ qβα δ
−qαδγβ qγβα 0

.
In other words, apart from the expected complementary angles qβαδ ,qγβα andqαδγβ , we also have to
insert qβα. This difficulty is the reason we restricted the complementary angle trick to the case where
all polygons are triangles.
Remark 5.16. There are bands objects which are uncurvable but do not fall under the requirements of
Theorem 5.14. Deriving finer criteria is however increasingly difficult. For instance, uncurvability of band
objects representing curves with a teardrop depends on whether the deformation parameter includes ℓs
for low s.
For string objects, the situation is complicated as well. Most string objects cannot be uncurved,
but there are exceptions. The underlying curve of a string object can typically be interpreted as an
arc candidate for some full arc system if it has no self-intersections. In this case, it is not uncurvable
for general deformation parameter r. A string object whose underlying curve is a loop may however be
uncurvable if r∈m2Z(GtlA).
6 The category of zigzag paths
In this section, we define the category Land construct for it an explicit homological splitting. This
category Lis a new, discrete analog of the smooth zigzag category studied by Cho, Hong and Lau [14].
We follow their idea of including all zigzag curves with chosen spin structure into a category, except
that we realize the curves as twisted complexes over the gentle algebra instead of objects in the Fukaya
category.
After defining this category L, the second step in this section is to analyze the morphisms between
the objects. We introduce terminology to handle locations where two zigzag paths come close to each
other: situations of type A, B, C and D. We show that every morphism between two zigzag paths can be
written as a linear combination of angles, and that each angle comes from a unique A, B, C or D type
situation.
Finally, we use this classification of morphisms to provide an explicit homological splitting for the cat-
egory L. This entails identifying a cohomology space Hfor every hom space, and finding complementary
spaces Rfor every pair of zigzag paths. The splitting of individual morphisms into H,IandRparts is
collected in Table 6.5, which will be referred to throughout the paper.
6.1 Category of zigzag paths
In this section, we define the category Lof zigzag paths. The idea is to turn zigzag paths in Qinto
twisted complexes in Tw Gtl Q. The construction of the twisted complexes requires the additional input
data of a spin structure for every zigzag path. We fix terminology and notation for these spin structures.
The result of the construction is the subcategory L⊆Tw Gtl Q.
Zigzag paths in Q Category of zigzag paths L⊆Tw Gtl Q
Generally, arcs as objects in Gtl Qcan be stitched together to form twisted complexes which model
curves in the Fukaya category. This is a well-known method, explicit in [7, Section 9.2] and implicit in
[16]. We have detailed it in section 5.1 and shall now apply it specifically to zigzag paths. Recall that a
zigzag path has necessarily even length, because it alternates between turning left and right.
Given a zigzag path L, we sometimes need to refer to specific angles surrounding L. We set up this
terminology as follows: Assume the consecutive arcs of the zigzag path are a1, a2, . . .. Let us assume Q
is geometrically consistent, so that every puncture in Qhas valency at least four. Thus, the mere data of
the arc sequence a1, a2, . . .already determines for every i∈Nwhether Lturns left or right at (the head
or tail of) ai. For those i∈Nwhere Lturns left at ai, denote by αithe angle that winds around the
common puncture h(ai) =t(ai+1), is shorter than a full turn, starts at the head of aiand ends at the
tail of ai+1. For those i∈Nwhere Lturns right at ai, denote by αithe angle that winds around the
common puncture h(ai) =t(ai+1), is shorter than a full turn, starts at the tail of ai+1and ending at the
head of ai. The notation is depicted in Figure 6.1a. We also call αithesmall angle inLbetween ai
andai+1.

(a) Arcs and angles in a zigzag path (b) A small angle and its zigzag path
Figure 6.1: Illustration of zigzag paths and small angles
Remark 6.1. Every (indexed) arc aieither has precisely two small angles leaving it and no small angle
ending at it, or two small angles ending at it and no small angles leaving it. In fact, the arcs of those
types alternate along L. The reader can easily convince himself of this fact by regarding Figure 6.1a.
Turning a zigzag path into a twisted complex requires the datum of a spin structure. For our purposes,
this simply entails choosing a sign ( −1)#αifor every small angle αiin the zigzag path. Writing the sign
additively, we fix the terminology as follows:
Definition 6.2. Aspin structure on a zigzag path Lis a choice of signs # αi∈Z/2Zfor each of its
small angles αi.
The notation # αimakes sense: If the small angle between aiandai+1is equal to the small angle
between ajandaj+1, then iandjdiffer precisely by a period of L. In short, every small angle of L
appears only once as small angle of Land therefore the notation # αimakes sense for the scope of a
single zigzag path.
Giving a spin structure simultaneously for all zigzag paths of Qis equivalent to giving a sign # α∈
Z/2Zfor all indecomposable angles αinQ. Indeed, if two zigzag paths L1andL2share a small angle,
then L1andL2are actually equal. This fact is depicted in Figure 6.1b. In that figure, the dashed arcs
indicate that the drawn angle shall be an interior angle of a polygon. In summary, giving a collection of
spin structures for all zigzag paths is equivalent to choosing a sign # α∈Z/2Zfor every indecomposable
angle αinQ.
Definition 6.3. LetQbe a geometrically consistent dimer and La zigzag path with spin structure.
Write the arcs of Lasa1, . . . , a 2k, chosen such that Lturns left from a1toa2. Let α1, α2, . . .be the small
angles in Lbetween a1anda2, etc. Then the twisted complex associated with Lis given by

In Definition 6.3, we have introduced abuse of notation twice: Using the letter “ L” both for a zigzag
path and its twisted complex, and simply calling both uses a “zigzag path”. The intention behind this
abuse is to switch seamlessly between between both uses. A typical sentence in this paper will be:
“Regard the endomorphisms of some zigzag path L.” In that sentence, it is clear that Lshall be a zigzag
path and we regard the endomorphisms of its associated twisted complex.
The twisted complex defined in Definition 6.3 is indeed a well-defined object of Tw Gtl Q, i.e.δsatisfies
the Maurer-Cartan equation:
Lemma 6.4. LetLbe a zigzag path with spin structure. Then its twisting differential δsatisfies the
Maurer-Cartan equation, so that Lindeed lies in Tw Gtl Q.
Proof. The Maurer-Cartan equation reads
µ1
Add Gtl Q(δ) +µ2
Add Gtl Q(δ, δ) +µ3
Add Gtl Q(δ, δ, δ ) +. . .= 0.
51Proving the Maurer-Cartan equation therefore boils down to showing that for any sequence of compatible
angles α1, . . . , α kappearing in the δmatrix of Lwe have
µk
GtlQ(αk, . . . , α 1) = 0 .
Let us check all such terms. Since the differential µ1
GtlQvanishes, we can assume k≥2. Assume a1starts
at arc a1and ends at a2. In order to have any nonzero contribution µk
GtlQ(. . . , α 1), there would need to
be a small angle starting at a2. According to Remark 6.1, every arc however admits either only incoming
or only outgoing small angles. Since α1is already an incoming angle for a2, we conclude that a2has no
outgoing angles. Therefore the product µk
GtlQ(. . . , α 1) vanishes. The reader can convince themself of this
visually by drawing a zigzag path together with its small angles and trying to draw an immersed disk
bounded solely by small angles. We conclude that δsatisfies the Maurer-Cartan equation.
Definition 6.5. Choose a spin structure for all zigzag paths L1, . . . , L NinQ. Then the category of
zigzag paths L⊆Tw Gtl Qis the (full) subcategory L={L1, . . . , L N}of Tw Gtl Qconsisting of all
zigzag paths with their single chosen spin structure.
Every zigzag path only appears once in L. We do not allow the same zigzag path multiple times in
Lwith different spin structures, since this is not the goal of this paper and it would make calculations
more complicated. Since Ldepends on Qand the choice of spin structures, denoting this category by the
letter Ldenotes a slight abuse of notation.
6.2 ABCD situations
In this section, we provide a basis for the hom spaces between zigzag paths. We depart from two zigzag
paths L1andL2and analyze their hom space in the category L. The first step is to introduce a notion
of elementary morphisms from L1toL2. This way, every morphism from L1toL2can be written as
a linear combination of elementary morphisms. We then classify elementary morphisms according to
the geometry of L1andL2in the surroundings of the morphisms. This gives rise to a classification
into four types A, B, C, D. Elementary morphisms associated with these four types provide a basis for
Hom L(L1, L2). Ultimately, the A, B, C, D types will accompany us during our entire journey to the
minimal model.
Regard two zigzag paths L1andL2. It is our aim to provide a basis for Hom( L1, L2). Recall from
section 3.9 that an indexed arc of a zigzag path consists of an arc lying on the zigzag path, together
with the datum of whether the zigzag path turns left or right at the head (equivalently tail) of the arc.
Recall from Definition 6.3 that every zigzag path comes with an associated twisted complex over Gtl Q.
Therefore any morphism ε∈Hom L(L1, L2) can be uniquely written as a linear combination of angles
from indexed arcs of L1to indexed arcs of L2. In other words, every angle from an indexed arc of L1to
an indexed arc of L2gives rise to a morphism ε∈Hom L(L1, L2), and all morphisms can be obtained as
sums of such “elementary morphisms”. Let us make this precise:
Definition 6.6. Anelementary morphism ε:L1→L2is an angle from an indexed arc of L1to an
indexed arc in L2, interpreted as morphism between twisted complexes.
We now move on to defining A, B, C and D situations. As a preparation, regard two consecutive arcs
a, bin an elementary polygon of Q. This pair defines a zigzag path L, namely the one starting with aand
turning then to b. This way, aandbbecome indexed arcs of L. Indeed, the zigzag path never traverses
afollowed by bagain, except after cycling once fully through L.
Definition 6.7. LetQbe a geometrically consistent dimer and L1andL2be zigzag paths.
AnA situation from L1toL2consists of two consecutive indexed arcs of L1and two consecutive
indexed arcs of L2such that both midpoints (head of the first arc, equally tail of the second arc) are
equal and all four arcs provide distinct incidences at this point. As in Figure 6.2a, the two arcs of L1are
cyclically denoted 1, 2. The two arcs of L2are cyclically denoted 3, 4. The angles involved are denoted
α,β,γandβ′. An elementary angle of this A situation is a product of such angles running from
1/2 to 3/4. Concretely, these are the angles in the A section of Table 6.5.
AB (resp. C) situation from L1toL2consists of an indexed arc 2 of L1and an indexed arc 5 of
L2such that 2 = 5 as arcs in Q,L1turns left (resp. right) at the head and tail of 2, and L2turns right
(resp. left) at the head and tail of 2. As in Figure 6.2b (resp. 6.2c), the neighboring indexed arcs are
denoted 1, 3, 4, 6. An elementary angle of this B (resp. C) situation is a composition of angles
in the figure, including id 2→5, that runs from 1/2/3 to 4/5/6. Concretely, these are the angles in the B
(resp. C) section of Table 6.5.

Figure 6.3: Examining case-by-case which situation εbelongs to. Here ε:L1→L2is an elementary
morphism strictly shorter than a full turn. Each of the cases corresponds to the option whether L1and
L2turns left or right at εand how many indecomposable angles εconsists of. In the figures, the latter
number is indicated below the target arc. The number above the target arc indicates the number of
indecomposable angles in the complement of ε. Due to zigzag consistency, the sum of the two numbers
is at least 4.
IfL1=L2, then a D situation from L1=L2to itself consists of a single indexed arc of L1=L2. If
L1=L2turns right at the head of the arc, this arc is denoted 1 and the next indexed arc is denoted 2.
IfL1=L2turns left, the arc is denoted 2 and the next indexed arc is denoted 1. The angles are named
as in Figure 6.2d. An elementary angle of this D situation is a composition of angles in the figure
that runs from the first arc to itself or to the second, from the second to the first, or from the second to
itself by at least one full turn.
An elementary morphism may be annotated with its type of situation to enhance clarity: β(A),α3
(B), id (C), id (D), etc.
Remark 6.8. Any arcs involved in a situation are allowed to be equal. The distinction and ordering of
arcs only concerns the local behavior of the arc ends at the common punctures.
We show that the A, B, C and D situations classify elementary morphisms uniquely. One may think
that, for example, an elementary morphism α3α4of a B situation equals an elementary morphism β′α2
of a C situation, or even α2α1of the same B situation. We now explain that this is not the case.
Proposition 6.9. LetQbe a geometrically consistent dimer and let L1, L2be zigzag paths in Q. Then
any elementary morphism ε:L1→L2is an elementary morphism of precisely one A, B, C or D situation.
Moreover, it is assigned only once as an elementary morphism of that situation.
53Proof. We show that any elementary morphism ε:L1→L2appears in an A, B, C or D situation. In
caseεis strictly shorter than a full turn, a case-by-case study is performed in Figure 6.3. Now if εis a
full turn or longer, write ε=ε′ℓn, where ℓndenotes a number of full turns. Then ε′itself is shorter than
a full turn and hence is an elementary morphism of an A, B, C or D situation. Then by definition also ε
is an elementary morphism of the same situation. Note this also applies in case ε′is id (B), id (C) or id
(D), since the turns ( α1β′α2)i(B), ( α4βα3)i(B), ( α1β′α2)i(C), ( α4βα3)i(C),αα′(D) and α′α(D) are
also elementary morphisms of B, C and D situations.
For uniqueness, realize that for any elementary morphism, as distinguished in Figure 6.3, we can read
off the entire situation and which of its elementary morphisms it concerns by inspecting which arc ends
coincide, where the zigzag path turns at εand in which directions the arrows point.
Classifying elementary morphisms into A, B, C, D situations is extremely handy. During this paper,
we often need to indicate generic morphisms of these four types. For instance, we may say that a certain
morphism is an “ α3morphism”. By this we mean that it is an α3morphism of one certain B situation.
6.3 Homological splitting
In this section, we introduce a homological splitting for the category Lof zigzag paths. The starting
point is the category Ltogether with the description of its hom spaces according to section 6.2. The first
step in this section is to fix once and for all the requirements on Qand additional data we assume for the
rest of the paper. The second step to define the splitting H⊕I⊕Rby giving an explicit basis in terms
of the A, B, C, D situations in Q. The idea is to reflect the geometry of the associated zigzag curves as
far as possible. It is worth memorizing some basis elements, for instance β(A) morphisms always belong
toR.
Let us fix once and for all the requirements on Qand the description of additional data we require.
Apart from assuming that Qis a fixed geometrically consistent dimer with spin structures chosen for
every of its zigzag paths, we also require the data of what we call idenity and co-identity locations. The
idea is that the choice of homological splitting in this paper is not entirely canonical, but depends on
these two kinds of choices. The datum of an identity location on a zigzag path Lentails the choice of an
indexed arc a0onL. The midpoint of a0is to be thought of as location of the identity intersection point
between the associated zigzag curve ˜Land its Hamiltonian deformation. The datum of a co-identity
location on a zigzag path Lentails the choice of a small angle α0onL. The midpoint of this angle is to
be thought of as the location of the co-identity intersection point between the associated zigzag curve ˜L
and its Hamiltonian deformation. For the visual meaning of identity and co-identity locations, we refer
to Figure 4.6 and 9.3. With these use cases in mind, we can state our convention as follows:
Convention 6.10. Qis a geometrically consistent dimer equipped with a choice of spin structure, identity
location a0and co-identity location α0on every zigzag path. The category Lcontains every zigzag path
once, with the chosen spin structure. The co-identity α0shall be chosen to lie in a counterclockwise
polygon.
We assume Convention 6.10 throughout section 7, 8 and 9 without further notice. Only in the
statement of the main theorems will we mention again that the convention is assumed. In Appendix C,
the convention is assumed as well, while Appendix D specifically deals with the sphere case where we
abandon the convention. The requirement that α0shall lie in a counterclockwise polygon is required to
make certain calculations work. For more details, we refer to the discussion in section F.3.
We are now ready to define the homological splitting. For H, the idea is to reflect the intersection
geometry of the associated zigzag curves as far as possible. The basis elements for Hdefined in this
section will be used throughout the paper and we refer to them as cohomology basis elements. For R, we
have to make slightly arbitrary choices of basis elements.
Definition 6.11. LetL1andL2be two zigzag paths. Denote by H⊆Hom L(L1, L2) the subspace
spanned by the cohomology basis morphisms
•for every B situation, ( −1)#α3+1α3+ (−1)#α4α4,
•for every C situation, id 2→5,
•ifL1=L2, then ( −1)#α0+1α0andP

Denote by R⊆Hom L(L1, L2) the subspace spanned by the following elements, collected from all
situations from L1toL2:

(b) Situation C intersection

•β′(α2α1β′)i(C),β(α3α4β)i(C),α1β′(α2α1β′)i(C),βα3(α4βα3)i(C),
•ida, a̸=a0(D),α′(αα′)i(D), ( α′α)i, i≥1 (D).
Denote by Ithe image of the twisted differential µ1
L: Hom L(L1, L2)→Hom L(L1, L2). Then R,Iand
Hform the (standard) splitting of Hom L(L1, L2).
The cohomology basis elements are to be interpreted as follows: The odd element ( −1)#α3+1α3+
(−1)#α4α4corresponds to the odd intersection between ˜L1and˜L2at the midpoint of the arc 2 = 5. In
contrast, the even element id 2→5corresponds to the even intersection between ˜L1and˜L2at the midpoint
of the arc 2 = 5. The odd element ( −1)#α0+1α0corresponds to the co-identity element of the zigzag
curve ˜L1. The even elementP
aidacorresponds to the identity element of the zigzag curve ˜L1. Two of
the geometric interpretations are depicted in Figure 6.4.
The splitting is not that hard to find and has at least been anticipated in [7, Section 9.2]. For more
information we refer to the discussion in section F.1. Our next step is to show that the standard splitting
indeed provides a homological splitting of L.
Lemma 6.12. LetL1andL2be zigzag paths. Then Hom L(L1, L2) =H+I+R.
Proof. Any morphism L1→L2is a sum of elementary morphisms. By Proposition 6.9, any elementary
morphisms belongs to an A, B, C or D situation. Given this case distinction, Table 6.5 shows that any
such morphism can be written as a sum of elements in R,IandH.
It is worth commenting on the fact that the equations in Table 6.5 actually hold true. This is due to
diligent evaluation of the twisted differential
µ1
L(ε) =µ1(ε) +µ2(δ, ε) +µ2(ε, δ) +. . . .
Let us examine the possible µ≥3terms appear. For any elementary morphism ε:L1→L2, at most one
δcan be inserted upfront and at the back. Hence only µ3disks can appear. Inspecting the direction of
δmorphisms, we conclude that the only possible disks appear in the case of µ1
L(β) of situation A and
µ1
L(β) and µ1
L(β′) of situation C.
First, let us examine the case of µ1
L(β) in situation A. Denote the corresponding δ-angles by γ1and
γ2, and the next arcs of L1andL2by 5 and 6. Then traversing 6, γ1, 2,β, 3,γ2, 5 must bound a disk
and hence 5 and 6 are equal arcs and the disk is a simple polygon. Then indeed µ1
L(β) includes an id 5→6
morphism. See Figure 6.6.
Next, we rule out the possibility that µ1
L(β) orµ1
L(β′) of situation C has a disk contribution. Carry
out the same analysis as in situation A and find that βorβ′is an elementary polygon angle, respectively.
Together with the fact that the neighboring angles α3andα4are also elementary polygon angles com-
prising a full turn around puncture t(2), this contradicts the fact that Qis a dimer. We conclude that
the differential µ1
L(β) in situation A remains as the only one that may include non-obvious terms.

Figure 6.7: Position of an angle αbetween α0anda0.
Let us explain the meaning of case 1 and 2 in Table 6.5. This case distinction appears when we try
to write an αangle with α̸=α0in terms of H,IandR. Obviously, precisely one of the following two is
the case:
1. The segment of L1starting with the target 2 of αand continuing in the direction of αfirst hits the
source or target of α0before hitting a0.
2. The segment of L1starting with the source 1 of αand continuing in the opposite direction of α
first hits the source or target of α0before hitting a0.
The two cases are depicted in Figure 6.7.
In case 1, put a1= 2, the indexed target of α. Denote by a1, . . . , a kthe segment of Luntil akis either
the indexed source or target of α0, whichever comes first. In case 2, put a1= 1, the indexed source of
α. Denote by a1, . . . , a kthe segment of Luntil akis either the indexed source or target of α0, whichever
comes first.
In both cases, let αibe the angle from ai−1toaiifiis odd, or from aitoai−1ifiis even. In
particular, put α1=αandαk+1=α0.
In case 1, we have
µ1
L(idai) = (−1)#αi+1αi+ (−1)#αi+1+1αi+1,ifiodd,
µ1
L(idai) = (−1)#αiαi+ (−1)#αi+1αi+1, ifieven.
Adding these up, we obtain
µ1
L(ida1+. . .+ id ak) = (−1)#α+1α+ (−1)#α0+1α0,ifkodd,
µ1
L(ida1+. . .+ id ak) = (−1)#α+1α+ (−1)#α0α0,ifkeven.
In case 2, we similarly get
µ1
L(ida1+. . .+ id ak) = (−1)#αα+ (−1)#α0α0,ifkodd,
µ1
L(ida1+. . .+ id ak) = (−1)#αα+ (−1)#α0+1α0,ifkeven.
This precisely verifies the equations in Table 6.5 concerning α(D).
Proposition 6.13. LetL1andL2be zigzag paths. Then the standard splitting H,I,Rdefines a
homological splitting of Hom L(L1, L2).
Proof. We need to check that Iis the image of µ1
L, that H+Iis the kernel of µ1
Land that Hom L(L1, L2) =
H⊕I⊕R. First, note that Iis the image of µ1
Lby definition. Next let us check that µ1
L(H) = 0. In our
57situational formalism, this is a simple calculation:
µ1
L((−1)#α3+1α3+ (−1)#α4α4) =µ2((−1)#α3+1α3,(−1)#α4α4) +µ2((−1)#α3α3,(−1)#α4α4) +µ≥3(. . .)
= (−1)#α3+#α4α3α4+ (−1)#α3+#α4+1α3α4= 0,
µ1
L(id (C)) = µ≥3(. . . ,id, . . .) = 0 ,
µ1
L(X
ida) =µ2(X
ida, δ) +µ2(δ,X
ida) +µ≥3(. . . ,id, . . .) =−δ+δ= 0,
µ1
L((−1)#α0+1α0) = (−1)#α0+1µ≥3(. . . , α 0, . . .) = 0 .
Indeed, both id (C) and α0(D) have no δmorphisms that can be multiplied upfront or at the back, and
correspondingly also produce no µ≥3disks. Since I⊆Ker(µ1
L), we conclude H+I⊆Ker(µ1
L).
Next, recall from Lemma 6.12 that we have Hom L(L1, L2) =H+I+R. Let us verify by dimension
counting that this sum is direct. For N∈N, denote by EN⊆E:= Hom L(L1, L2) the subspace spanned
by elementary angles of at most Nfull turns. This is a finite dimensional space.
Table 6.5 implies that any element of ENcan be written as a sum of elements of H∩EN,I∩ENand
R∩ENifN≥1. The sum of these three spaces is direct, since the sum of their dimensions is less than
or equal to the dimension of EN:
dim(H∩EN)
+= #B+ #C[+2 if L1=L2],
dim(I∩EN)
+≤2N#A+ (4N−1)#B+ 4N#C[+2N#D−1 ifL1=L2],
dim(R∩EN)
≤= 2N#A+ (4N+ 1)# B+ 4N#C[+(2N+ 1)# D−1 ifL1=L2],
dimEN = 4N#A+ (8N+ 1)# B+ (8N+ 1)# C[+(4N+ 1)# DifL1=L2].
Here # A, #B, #Cand # Ddenote the number of situations of type A, B, C and D that appear from
L1toL2.
The filtration of EbyENis exhaustive. If the zero element of Eis a nontrivial sum of elements of
H,IandR, then by picking the maximum number of turns Ninvolved, we obtain a contradiction to
ENbeing the direct sum of H∩EN,I∩ENandR∩EN. We conclude that E=H⊕I⊕R.
Finally, let us argue that Ker( µ1
L) =H⊕I. Indeed, the equivalent statement that µ1
L:R→Iis
injective can be checked by an elementary situational calculation. Note that if εis from a certain situation,
then µ1
L(ε) is from the same situation, apart from triangle degenerations and situation D morphisms.
Alternatively, note the cohomology of the complex Hom L(L1, L2) is precisely Floer cohomology: The
category H Tw Gtl Qis nothing else than the wrapped Fukaya category of Q. Now Floer cohomology has
a basis element for every intersection of L1andL2, plus an identity and a co-identity if L1=L2. We
conclude
dim(Ker( µ1
L)/I) = # B+ #C[+2 if L1=L2] = dim H.
This implies Ker( µ1
L) =H⊕Iand finishes the proof.
7 The deformed category of zigzag paths
In this section, we define and study the deformed category Lqof zigzag paths. This category is the
deformed version of L. Its deformation comes from the deformation Gtl qQof the gentle algebra. Already
in the definition of Lq, we apply the complementary angle trick from section 5.3 in order to remove the
curvature. We then analyze the differential µ1
Lq, in fact investigate how µ1
Lqinteracts with the homological
splitting of Lfrom section 6.3. We show that Lqfalls under the regime of the simplified deformed
Kadeishvili construction from section 2.3. We provide explicit formulas for the deformed codifferential
hqand deformed projection πqin terms of “tails” of the morphisms involved.

Description of µ1

and projection πq
58These “tails” arise from applying the general Kadeishvili construction to the specific case of Lq.
According to the general deformed Kadeishvili theorem, we need to find for every cohomology basis
element h∈Ha certain deformed version φ−1(h) such that φ−1(h) and honly differ by Rterms. In case
ofLq, we can explicitly describe φ−1(h) for each of the cohomology basis elements in H. The explicit
description forces us to define and make us of what we call the tails of morphisms. Tails work as follows:
Letε:L1→L2be an elementary morphism. Look at all locations where L1andL2come close to each
other and bound a discrete immersed disk together with ε. It turns out that these locations of closeness
have a hierarchical structure, which we organize in a tree. This tree is the tail of εand carries the data
of many secondary A, B, C or D situations which lie far away from ε. We use the angles contained in
this tail to construct explicitly the deformed cohomology basis elements φ−1. In other words, tails are
the right tool to convert the rather algebraic requirement of the deformed Kadeishvili theorem into a
geometric interpretation in the specific case of Lq.
Remark 7.1. From this section onwards, we typically write µorµqfor the product of Add Gtl qQ:
µq:=µ:=µAdd Gtl qQ.
The reason for this notation is that we frequently expand products of the twisted completion Tw Gtl qQ
in terms of the products of the additive completion. This shorthand is meant to facilitate this expansion
and mixes well with writing µorµqfor the product of Gtl qQ. The product of Gtl Qis irrelevant and is
never meant. We keep the shorthand µquntil section 9.
7.1 Deformed zigzag paths
In this section, we define the category Lqof deformed zigzag paths. The starting point is the non-deformed
category Lof zigzag paths. Taking the same twisted complexes gives a subcategory of Tw Gtl qQ. The
aim of the entire paper is to compute a minimal model for this subcategory. According to the deformed
Kadeishvili theorem, the first step is to gauge away as much curvature as possible. The aim of the present
section is to conduct this uncurving procedure, and to define Lqto be the resulting uncurved category.
The essential tool for uncurving is the complementary angle trick of section 5.3.

Lq⊆Tw′GtlqQuncurving
Recall that the zigzag paths are objects in Tw Gtl Q. They can also be interpreted as objects in
Tw Gtl qQby definition of the deformed twisted completion. As an object of Tw Gtl qQ, every zigzag
path has curvature. Our approach is to uncurve every zigzag path by means of the complementary angle
trick of section 5.3. For every zigzag path, the trick gives rise to a twisted complex with also infinitesimal
below-diagonal entries. By definition, this is an element of the category Tw′GtlqQwhich we recalled in
Remark 2.20. We shall call this object a deformed zigzag path because its δ-matrix has been deformed.
The precise definition for deformed zigzag paths reads as follows:
Definition 7.2. LetLbe a zigzag path of Q, with twisted complex
L= (a1⊕a3⊕. . .⊕ak⊕a2⊕. . .⊕a2k, δ)
as in Definition 6.3. Then the corresponding deformed zigzag path is the following object of Tw′Gtlq,
also denoted L:

59Figure 7.1: Fictitious discrete immersed disks bounded by segments of zigzag paths
The deformed zigzag paths are objects of Tw′GtlqQ. The entries of their δ-matrix are angles αiand
α′
i, which we call the inner respectively outer δ-angles ofL. The main interest of the present paper is
in the subcategory of all deformed zigzag paths, each with their associated choice of spin structure. We
give the category consisting of these objects a name:
Definition 7.3. Thecategory of deformed zigzag paths is the full subcategory Lq⊆Tw′GtlqQ
consisting of the deformed zigzag paths.
The category Lqis a deformation of L. This follows directly from the definition of the liberal twisted
completion construction Tw′Cq, see [18]. It is completely acceptable that we have inserted below-diagonal
entries into the twisted complex. In what follows, we explain why Lqis indeed curvature-free. It is in
fact a consequence of the more general property of the complementary angle trick Lemma 5.11, but we
provide here a direct proof as well. The direct proof builds on the fact that segments of zigzag paths in
geometrically consistent dimers cannot bound discrete immersed disks. In Figure 7.1 we have depicted
a fictitious discrete immersed disk bounded by a zigzag path and we shall prove that this situation is
indeed impossible:
Lemma 7.4. LetQbe a zigzag consistent dimer and La zigzag path. Then a segment of Lcannot
bound a discrete immersed disk.
Proof. Assume towards contradiction that D:Pk→ |Q|is a discrete immersed disk bounded by a
segment of L. Then at least one of the consecutive interior angles of the discrete immersed disk must be
an outer δ-angle α′and hence consist of at least two indecomposable angles. The rest of the argument is
a standard contradiction from geometric consistency theory: Construct a zigzag path L′atα′that points
inside the discrete immersed disk. Follow L′until it leaves the discrete immersed disk. To be precise,
“leaving” refers not to the leaving an area in |Q|, but to touching the boundary ∂Pkin the domain of
the underlying polygon immersion D:Pk→ |Q|. Either way, the final arc abefore definitely leaving
the discrete immersed disk lies on the boundary of the disk due to the zigzag nature of L. The Land
L′segments from α′until aare homotopic, since both lie in the discrete immersed disk. We obtain a
contradiction with geometric consistency. This shows that Lcannot bound a discrete immersed disk.
Lemma 7.5. Every deformed zigzag path Lis curvature-free.
Proof. The curvature of Las object in Tw Gtl qQis
µ0
Add Gtl qQ,L+µ1
Add Gtl qQ(δ) +µ2
Add Gtl qQ(δ, δ) +. . .
It is our task to prove that this curvature vanishes. A first observation is that the two terms µ0
Add Gtl qQ,L
andµ2
Add Gtl qQ(δ, δ) precisely cancel each other and we have µ1
Add Gtl qQ= 0. By Lemma 7.4, a segment
ofLcannot bound a discrete immersed disk and we conclude that µ≥3
Add Gtl qQ(δ, . . .) = 0. Adding up all
4 terms, we see that the curvature of the deformed zigzag path vanishes. This finishes the proof.
7.2 EFGH disks
In this section, we develop elementary understanding of the differential µ1
Lq. The starting point is the
description of the category Lqby explicit twisted complexes. The differential µ1
Lqdoes not vanish, but
counts those discrete immersed disks where apart from one single angle all interior angles stem from the
δ-matrix of the twisted complex. In this section, we classify these disks into four types which we call E,
F, G and H disks. The goal is to be able to say:

naming of α1andα2is in case the arc outside the disk points upwards (type G1). For the type H disk,
the naming of α1andα3are in case the concluding arc points to the right.

Here each δinsertion stands for the δ-matrix of L1orL2, depending on whether δstands right or left
ofε. The individual summands µ1
q(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ) can again be expanded by writing the δ-matrix as the
sum of its entries, the δ-angles. The elegant way to capture all the terms arising this way is as follows: We
say a disk made of µq(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ) is a final-out, first-out or all-in disk with angle sequence consisting
ofε, preceded and succeeded by an arbitrary number of δ-angles. This way, we have enumerated all terms
contributing to µ1
Lq(ε).
In Definition 7.6, we categorize the disks made of µq(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ) into four types. As a starting
point, every disk made of µq(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ) is by definition a discrete immersed disk, together with
possibly an outside morphism βorγin the terminology of Definition 3.50. In the categorization and its
proof, we make heavy use of the slots, concluding puncture and concluding arc terminology introduced in
section 3.9. For instance, we may say that L1“turns right towards the concluding puncture of the disk”.
As an example, in Figure 7.2a the zigzag path L1turns right towards the concluding puncture and L2
turns left towards the concluding puncture. The categorization is obtained by a case distinction based
on the behavior of L1andL2towards the concluding puncture.
Definition 7.6. Letε:L1→L2be an elementary morphism. Then a disk that can be made of
µq(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ) is of
•type E if it is some-out, L1turns right towards the concluding puncture, L2turn left towards the
concluding puncture, and there are at least 3 slots outside the disk,
•type F if it is some-out, there are at least two slots both inside and outside the disk, and L1turns
left and L2right towards the concluding puncture, or the other way around,
•type G if it is some-out, L1turns right towards the concluding puncture and L2turns left towards
to concluding puncture and there are 2 slots outside the disk,
•type H if it is all-in; or if it is first-out, L2turns right towards the concluding puncture and there
is only 1 slot inside the disk; or if it is final-out, L1turns left towards the concluding puncture and
there is only 1 slot inside the disk.
A disk of type G is of type G1 if the first, shared, arc of L1andL2at the concluding puncture, outside
the disk, is oriented towards the concluding puncture, and of type G2 if the arc is oriented away from
the puncture.
The terminology is depicted in Figure 7.2. We now show that the types E, F, G, H indeed provide
an exhaustive classification of disks that can be made of µq(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ). During the proof, we will
frequently use slots terminology from section 3.9. We also show that some of the disk types come in pairs

or triples. For instance, type E disks come in pairs. By this, we mean that every type E disk comes
naturally with a distinct partner also of type E.
Lemma 7.7. Letε:L1→L2be an elementary morphism. Then type E, F, G, H provide an exhaustive
classification of disks that can be made from µq(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ). Type E disks come naturally in pairs,
type F disks come alone, type G disks come in pairs and type H disks come in triples.
Proof. We first prove that every disk that can be made of µq(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ) falls under one of the four
types and then comment on the pairs and triples.
LetDbe a disk that can be made of µq(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ). Then Dis either first-out, final-out or all-in.
We shall in all three cases that Dfalls under our classification. The simplest way to understand the proof
is by trying to recognize the properties we derive about Din Figure 7.2.
Assume Dis first-out. Then the first morphism must be a δinsertion and not ε, otherwise L2
would bound a discrete immersed disk, in conflict with geometric consistency. The δ-insertion necessarily
concerns an outer δ-angle, as opposed to an inner δ-angle, and we conclude that L1turns right at the
concluding puncture. There are at least two slots outside of Dat the concluding puncture. If L2turns
left at the concluding puncture, then Dis of type E or G, depending on the number of slots outside D.
IfL2turns right at the concluding puncture, then Dis of type F or H, depending on the number of slots
inside D.
A similar classification holds if Dis final-out. Finally assume Dis all-in. Then the concluding arc
belongs to both L1andL2. Including the concluding arc, the L1andL2segments bounding the disk
are at least 2 arcs long, since otherwise the L2orL1segment would bound a discrete immersed disk in
conflict with geometric consistency. Let us analyze how L1andL2continue beyond the concluding arc
ofD, away from their segments that bound D. Imagine that L1turns left at the head (and tail) of the
concluding arc. Then L1enters the interior of D, in conflict with geometric consistency, or lands on the
arc of L2before the concluding arc, which would render L1=L2and mean that L1bounds a discrete
immersed disk. We conclude that L1turns right and L2turns left at the concluding arc. In particular,
there are at least two slots on the outside of the disk. This constitutes a type H disk. We have finished
the first part of the proof.
For the second part of the proof, let us comment on the pairs and triples. We shall here restrict to the
case of type E disks, since the other cases are similar. To show that type E disks come in pairs, the idea
is to simply match two type E disks with each other by swapping the δinsertions: Regard a first-out type
E disk. Then its first angle is a δinsertion. Remove this δinsertion and instead append a δinsertion as
final angle. The result is a final-out disk, the desired partner disk. The partner disk is also of type E. The
first angle of the first-out disk and the final angle of its final-out partner disk are depicted in Figure 7.2a
as well. Both disks have the same underlying discrete immersed disk, up to cyclically permuting the
inputs and the output by one. The other types F, G, H are similar, and the relevant first/final angles are
depicted in Figure 7.2 as well. This finishes the proof.
7.3 Deformed differential
In this section, we investigate the precise shape of the differential µ1
Lq. The starting point is the description
of possible output of µ1
Lqin terms of E, F, G, H disks, according to section 7.2. For the purposes of the
deformed Kadeishvili theorem, this description would not be sufficient. We therefore trace the shape of
µ1
Lqeven further. As announced, this leads to the data structure which we call the tail of an elementary
morphism.
Letε:L1→L2be an elementary morphism. We have seen that the disks that can be made of
µq(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ) are of type E, F, G, H and come in groups, which we call the disk shapes ofε. In
order to describe µ1
Lq, we need to capture the situation near the concluding puncture or arc of the disk
shapes. For instance for a type E disk shape D, we shall assign to Dthe A situation at the concluding
62puncture of D. An A situation is already given by specifying the its angles α,β,γandβ′as in Figure 6.2.
In generality, we fix the following notation:
Definition 7.8. Letε:L1→L2be an elementary morphism.
•For each type E disk shape Dofε, denote by ( αD, βD, γD, β′D) the A situation at the concluding
puncture. Let sD∈Zbe the sum of the total # signs of all δinsertions along the disk, including
both # αDand # γD.
•For each type F disk shape Dofε, denote by ( αD, βD, γD, β′D) the A situation at the concluding
puncture. Let sD∈Zbe the sum of the total # signs of all δinsertions along the disk, including
#αDifDis first-out and including # γDifDis final-out.
•For each type G disk shape Dofε, denote by ( αD
1, αD
2, αD
3, αD
4, βD, β′D) the B situation at the
concluding puncture. Let sD∈Zbe the sum of the total # signs of all δinsertions along the disk,
including both # α1and # α2or #α3and # α4, depending on the orientation of the arc 2D= 5D.
•For each type H disk shape Dofε, denote by ( αD
1, αD
2, αD
3, αD
4, βD, β′D) the C situation at the
concluding puncture. Let sD∈Zbe the sum of the total # signs of all δinsertions along the disk,
including # α1and # α3or #α2and # α4, depending on the orientation of the concluding arc.
In all cases, the element qD∈CJQ0Kis the product of all punctures covered by the discrete immersed
disk, including those punctures on the boundary whose δinsertion is an outer δangle, and including the
concluding puncture or both endpoints of the concluding arc.
In Definition 7.9, we define tails of elementary morphisms. The motivation is as follows: To apply the
deformed Kadeishvili theorem to Lq, we need to provide the deformed counterparts of the cohomology
basis elements from section 6.3. For instance, for a given situation B cohomology basis element h=
(−1)#α3+1α3+ (−1)#α4α4∈Hwe need to find a deformed counterpart φ−1(h) such that φ−1(h) and
honly differ by infinitesimal Rterms and µ1
Lq(φ−1(h)) = 0. The first step is to note that µ1
Lq(h) is
described, among others, by the type E disks which can be made of its two components α3andα4. Every
type E disk shape Dofα3gives a contribution to µ1
Lq(α3) of
(−1)sD+#γD+|γDβD|qDγDβD+ (−1)sD+#αDqDβDαD. (7.1)
Similarly, every type E disk of α4gives a contribution to µ1
Lq(α4). Counting these contributions together,
we see that µ1
Lq(h) already contains two terms for every type E disk shape of α3plus two terms for every
type E disk shape of α4. We see that µ1
Lq(h) is far from zero. The deformed counterpart φ−1(h) is given
by adding Rterms to hsuch that µ1
Lqeventually becomes zero. We observe that adding a multiple of
βDfor every disk shape Dofα3orα4does the trick in that it kills the two terms in (7.1). However,
µ1
Lq(βD) does not equate only to the two terms in (7.1), but also to terms coming from the E, F, G, H
disks which can be made of βDitself. In turn, we have to kill these terms by adding yet more Rterms,
and every time we add Rterms we obtain new Rterms which we kill again. This gives rise to a recursive
terms killing process which we can fortunately organize in a hierarchical structure, the tail of α3andα4.
The precise definition for general elementary morphisms reads as follows:
Definition 7.9. Letε:L1→L2be an elementary morphism. Then its tailis the tree Tdefined as
follows. Insert εas root. For each disk shape Dofε, attach Das a child, annotated additionally with
the type of D. Continue inductively: For each leaf D∈Tof type E, attach all disk shapes of βDas
children, annotated with their types.
LetD∈Tbe a node of type E. Denote by D0=ε, . . . , D n=Dbe the sequence of nodes from the
root till D. Set
SD=nX
i=1sDi, QD=nY
i=1qDi.
The morphism εisE-preserving if its tail Tonly consists of type E disks, apart from εitself.
The schematic of tails is depicted in Figure 7.4a. Roughly speaking, a tail collects sequences of type
E disks where every βDmorphism serves as εfor the next item in the sequence. The tail also collects
type F, G or H disks but does not trace them any further. A sample elementary morphism together with
its tail is depicted in Figure 7.4. In drawing the elementary morphism and its disks, we have neglected
the zigzag nature of the zigzag paths. In drawing the tail, we have only depicted the tree structure and
the type indication on all nodes and ignored the discrete immersed disk and situation data.

Figure 7.4: Illustration of tails
The typical tail is best imagined as a linear chain of type E disks with possibly an F, G or H disk at
the end. Theoretically, nonlinear tails exist, but they require an angle sequence which bounds more than
a single discrete immersed disks. Such angle sequences exist, but are very large, see also Remark 3.32.
Depending on the further knowledge of an elementary morphism ε, we can say a more about the
structure of its tail. In fact, every morphism from a B or C situation is E-preserving by virtue of
geometric consistency. The following lemma makes this precise. Its premise is depicted in Figure 7.3.
Lemma 7.10. Letε:L1→L2be an elementary morphism. Suppose that above εthe zigzag paths
L1andL2intersect and their segments from εuntil the intersection are homotopic. Or suppose that
atε, the zigzag path L1turns to the the target arc of εorL2turns to the source arc of ε. Then εis
E-preserving. In particular, this applies if εis a morphism from a B or C situation.
Proof. The first observation is that εcannot have disk shapes of type G or H, since these would create a
digon with the intersection above ε. We argue that εcan also not have type F disk shapes. Indeed, the
ray of L1orL2that turns into the interior of a discrete immersed disk would leave the disk at some point,
creating a contractible self-intersection of L1orL2or a digon with the intersection above ε. We conclude
thatεhas only disks of type E. The same argument can now be applied inductively to all children of ε.
Ultimately, the entire tail of εconsists only of type E disk shapes and we conclude εis E-preserving.
Elementary morphisms of a B or C situation automatically satisfy the premises of the lemma, simply
because the involved zigzag paths intersect at the arc which we called 2 = 5 in Figure 6.2. This finishes
the proof.
As we will see, tails are indeed the right tool to describe the deformed counterparts of cohomology
basis elements. In Lemma 7.11, we prepare for this by explicitly decomposing µ1
Lqwith respect to the
decomposition
Hom Lq(L1, L2) = (CJQ0Kb⊗H)⊕µ1
Lq(CJQ0Kb⊗R)⊕(CJQ0Kb⊗R).

Here, we have stripped off type F disks and the two first- and final-out type H disks. Both yield multiples
ofβ(A),β(C) and β′(C), which lie in R. Let us now add up the right-hand side of (7.2). This becomes
a telescopic sum: The E, G2 and H terms cancel pairwise and the G2 terms cancel in triples. Only terms
coming directly from the root remain. Modulo R, the right-hand side of (7.2) now reads

7.4 Deformed cohomology basis elements
In this section, we compute the deformed cohomology basis elements of Lq. The starting point is the
homological splitting H⊕I⊕RforLfrom section 6.3. This splitting itself is not a homological splitting
for the deformed category Lq. Rather, we show that Lqtogether with H⊕I⊕Rfalls under the “ D= 0”
case of our deformed Kadeishvili theorem studied in section 2.3. Accordingly, the category Lqcomes with
an associated homological splitting, including a list of deformed counterparts φ−1(h) of the cohomology
basis elements h∈H. In the present section, we compute all these deformed cohomology basis elements.
Proposition 7.12. For the category Lq⊆Tw Gtl qwe have
µ1
Lq(H)⊆µ1
Lq(CJQ0Kb⊗R).
65Hence the deformed Kadeishvili construction of section 2.3 applies to Lq. It produces a deformed homo-
logical splitting
Lq=Hq⊕µ1
Lq(CJQ0Kb⊗R)⊕(CJQ0Kb⊗R)
and a minimal model H Lq. For each cohomology basis element h∈H, we obtain a deformed counterpart
φ−1(h), explicitly given as follows:
•The deformed counterpart of ( −1)#α3+1α3+ (−1)#α4α4(B) is

•The deformed counterpart of ( −1)#α0+1α0(D) is
(−1)#α0+1α0+ (−1)#α0qα′

In the case of id 2→5, the punctures q1, q2∈Q0are the head and tail of arc 2. In the case of ( −1)#α0+1α0,
the puncture qis the one around which α0turns. The codifferential is denoted hqand the projection
onto Hqis denoted πq.
Proof. All the β(A) and α′
0(D) morphisms added in the claimed deformed cohomology basis elements lie
inCJQ0Kb⊗R. In order to show µ1
Lq(H)⊆µ1
Lq(CJQ0Kb⊗R), it therefore suffices to show that µ1
Lqvanishes
on all the four types of claimed deformed cohomology basis elements. We check this for all four types
individually.
For the situation B type the vanishing amounts to applying Lemma 7.11 to α3andα4, and adding
the results. Since α3andα4are E-preserving, the complicated sums over type G and H disks vanish.
For the situation C type, note that β(C) and β′(C) are E-preserving. Therefore two applications of
Lemma 7.11 and a direct computation give the following results, whose sum renders the desired differential
indeed zero:
µ1

For the situation D identityP
aida(D), note that no disk sequences can be made with an identity. The
ordinary product of id awith a neighboring α′

Lqand they cancel each other:

For the situation D co-identity ( −1)#α0+1α0(D), note that no disks can be made of µq(δ, . . . , α′

due to consistency. We get
µ1

0) =−(−qα0α′
0−qα′
0α0+qα0α′
0+qα′
0α0) = 0 .
This finishes the proof.
667.5 Deformed codifferential and projection
In this section, we compute part of the deformed codifferential and deformed projection for Lq. The
starting point is the homological splitting H⊕I⊕RforL. In section 7.4, we have verified that Lq
satisfies the requirements of the deformed Kadeishvili construction of section 2.3 so that we obtain a
deformed homological splitting Hq⊕µ1
Lq(CJQ0Kb⊗R)⊕(CJQ0Kb⊗R). According to Definition 2.28, there is
an associated deformed codifferential hqgiven by projecting morphisms onto µ1
Lq(CJQ0Kb⊗R) and finding
theRpreimage element under µ1
Lq. In the present section, we examine this procedure for the morphisms
βαandβof A situations and indicate how one proceeds for other types of morphisms.
Let us recall how the (non-deformed) codifferential for Lworks. Regard an A situation, given by
angles ( α, β, γ, β′). Then βlies in R, while βαlies in I+R. According to Table 6.5, we have h(βα) =
(−1)#α+1β. For the deformed codifferential, we however have to add terms. It is namely not true that
µ1
Lq((−1)#α+1β) =βα+(−1)#α+#γ+∥β∥+1γβ. Rather, the differential µ1
Lq(β) is computed by the formula
(7.2). The formula implies we have to subtract terms from the expression ( −1)#α+1βin order to make
itsµ1
Lqimage up to R-terms equal to βα. In the following proposition, we compute these terms.
Proposition 7.13. Let (β, α, γ, β′) denote an A situation L1→L2. Denote by T(β) the tail of β. Then
we have
hq(βα) = (−1)#α+1β+X
D∈T(β)\{β}

Proof. Apply hqandφπqon both sides of Lemma 7.11 with ε=β.
Remark 7.14. The morphisms of type βα(A) are the most important morphisms to which we would
like to apply the deformed codifferential hq. There are only very few cases where we need to apply hqto
other morphisms. In fact, hqvanishes by definition on all deformed cohomology basis elements and all
elements of R. The only interesting elementary morphisms which do not lie in Hq⊕(CJQ0Kb⊗R) are α4β
(C),β′α2(C) and α3α4(B). For these three types of morphisms, one obtains formulas for their hqandπq
values by applying (7.2) to ε=β(C) or ε=β′(C) or ε=α3(B). The results are formulas very similar
to Proposition 7.13. In contrast to β(A), these three morphisms have the benefit of being E-preserving.
Therefore all complicated G and H terms on the right-hand side of (7.2) do not even appear and only
µ2(δ, ε) +µ2(ε, δ) and the sum over type E nodes remain.
8 Result components of Kadeishvili trees
In this section, we develop a first glance at the minimal model H Lq. The starting point is the knowledge of
Lqestablished in section 7 and the deformed Kadeishvili construction recalled in section 2.3. According
to the deformed Kadeishvili construction, the deformed A∞-structure on the minimal model H Lqis
determined by Kadeishvili trees. The outstanding task is therefore to enumerate and analyze all results
from all possible Kadeishvili trees.
In section 8.1, we explain which products are to be computed and set up notation. In section 8.2, we
list possible types of morphisms resulting from Kadeishvili trees. In section 8.3, we introduce a notion
of “result components” which allows us to systematically track terms arising from Kadeishvili trees. In
section 8.4, we conclude the section with a semi-explicit, inductive characterization of result components:
Individual output terms

678.1 Kadeishvili trees
This section explains how our minimal model theorem applies to Lqspecifically. We explain which trees
need to be investigated, and which not. We also set up specific terminology. Note that we keep writing
µ:=µq:=µAdd Gtl qQ, see Remark 7.1.
The deformed Kadeishvili construction instructs us to start with the hom spaces. If L1andL2are
zigzag paths, then Hom HLq(L1, L2) =CJQ0Kb⊗H, where Hdenotes the cohomology in the standard
splitting of Tw Gtl Q. The higher products on H Lqare obtained as outputs of Kadeishvili trees, with
φ−1:CJQ0Kb⊗H→Hqapplied at all leaves, hqµLqapplied at all non-leaf nodes, and φπqµLqapplied at
the root.
We do not need to calculate all trees. In fact, we observe directly from the Kadeishvili construction
thatµHLqis strictly unital, with the same unit morphisms as Lq. More precisely, we already know that
for every zigzag path Land compatible morphism hwe have
µ1
HLq= 0, µ2
HLq(h,idL) =h
µ≥3
HLq(. . . ,idL, . . .) = 0 , µ2
HLq(idL, h) = (−1)|h|h.
It therefore suffices to regard Kadeishvili trees whose inputs are all non-identity cohomology basis ele-
ments. At this point, it is clever to have terminology available to study not only entire Kadeishvili trees,
but also their subtrees. We fix the following terminology:
Definition 8.1. Anh-tree is an ordered tree Twhere each non-leaf node has at least two children,
together with non-identity deformed basis cohomology elements h1, . . . , h Non the leaves from right to
left, with hi:Li→Li+1.
Aπ-tree is an ordered tree Twith at least three nodes where each non-leaf node has at least two
children, together with non-identity deformed basis cohomology elements h1, . . . , h Non the leaves from
right to left, with hi:Li→Li+1.
Both h-trees and π-trees can be evaluated. They have results oroutputs . When evaluating an
h-tree, we put hqµon every non-leaf node. When evaluating a π-tree, we put hqµon every non-leaf
non-root node, and φπqµon the root.
Remark 8.2. Often we will make statements about “products”. The datum of a “product” shall then
typically include all of its inputs. For example “a product µ≥3(. . .)” refers to a choice of arity k≥3, a
collection of compatible morphisms a1, . . . , a kand the result of the product itself.
Remark 8.3. Since we abbreviate µ=µq=µAdd Gtl qQ, a product µ2(a, b) stands simply for the
product of angles and does not include discrete immersed disk terms like µ3(δ, a, b ) stemming from
twisted completion. Similarly, a product µ≥3always stands for a single discrete immersed disk, and
following the rule explained in Remark 8.2 it includes the datum of input morphisms some of which may
beδ-morphisms. Note that δ-morphisms are always spelt out as α(D) or α′(D).
Remark 8.4. We occasionally group β(C) and β′(C) as β/β′(C) due to their similar nature. We ignore
signs and deformation parameters q∈CJQ0Kin this section. For example, we may say that a product
likeµ≥3(α, α′, α3, . . .) is id (D), meaning that it is equal to some arc identity, possibly multiplied by a
sign and deformation parameters. We abbreviate a situation B cohomology basis element ( −1)#α3+1α3+
(−1)#α4α4simply as α3+α4.
8.2 Possible tree output
In this section, we analyze the possible types of output of Kadeishvili trees. The starting point is the
observation that the result of a Kadeishvili tree is a linear combination of elementary morphism, but
not every elementary morphism can actually appear. In the present section, we compose a tight list of
possible elementary morphisms that can result from Kadeishvili trees.
By nature, a π-tree can only have a linear combination of cohomology basis elements as output.
Similarly, an h-tree can only have a linear combination of Rbasis morphims as output. Every node of an
h- or π-tree carries an evaluation result itself. To further narrow down on the possible output of the tree,
we have to investigate what happens at every node in the tree. For instance, we claim that angle length
cannot grow to infinity as we go from leaves to root. In fact, we claim there is a list Sof morphisms
which is stable under evaluations, in the sense that any hqµapplied to a sequence of morphisms from S
yields a morphism from Sagain. The explicit list reads as follows:

S:=β(A), id (B), α3(B),α4(B), id (C), β(C),β′(C), id (D), α0(D) and α′
0(D).
We claim that this list Sis preserved under evaluations hqµ. Before we prove this, let us prepare
reasoning. For all three cases of hqµ2, first-out hqµ≥3and final-out hqµ≥3evaluation, we have set up
product schemes which indicate the type of output from in principle any kind of evaluations with arbitrary
inputs from S.
These product schemes are found in Table 8.1, Figure 8.2 and 8.3. They are generally structured
by the three keys µ,hqandφπq. The schemes should universally be read as follows: A product of
morphisms of given types may yield only the types of morphisms indicated in the µrow. Application of
the codifferential yields the morphism indicated in the hqrow. Of course, vanishing products are also
possible. For later use, the possible results of φπqµhave been collected in the φπqrow. With these
product schemes in mind, we are ready to prove that the list Sis preserved:
Lemma 8.5. LetTbe an h-tree. Then its output contains only β(A), id (B), α3(B),α4(B), id (C),
β(C),β′(C), id (D), α0(D) and α′
0(D) terms.
Proof. LetSbe the set of all elementary morphisms of these types. We prove the claim by induction on
the tree size. For an h-tree with just one node, leaf and root at the same time, there is nothing to show,
since the result of this tree is the deformed basis cohomology element itself which only contains terms
from S.
Now for any arbitrarily large tree, output components are of the form
hq(µ≥3(mk, . . . , m 1)) and hq(µ2(m2, m1)), (8.1)
where by induction hypothesis each miis from S, or may in case of µ≥3also be a δinsertion. We will
now check all possible terms that can occur in (8.1).

Table 8.1: Multiplication scheme (continued)
In the case of a discrete immersed disk µ≥3(mk, . . . , m 1), assume the disk is all-in. Then the µ≥3
result is an identity from situation B, C or D. Its image under hqvanishes in all three cases.
Assume now the disk is first-out. Then the first morphism is by assumption one in S. In particular, it
is strictly smaller than one full turn. Since the disk is first-out, the first morphism m1consists of at least
two indecomposable angles. We can now compute the µ≥3result on a case-by-case basis, distinguishing
after the type of m1. The results are shown in Figure 8.2. The figures omit the case of α′
0which is
similar to that of an outer δinsertion. Hatching indicates the interior of the disk. Similarly, the results
for final-out disks are shown in Figure 8.3.
We conclude that for any discrete immersed disk, the output hq(µ≥3(mk, . . . , m 1)) consists only of
terms lying in S. Next, we check the terms occurring in a simple composition µ2(m2, m1)). Table 8.1
contains the results of such multiplications, “imp” denoting an impossible combination, hence vanishing
product. The table also lists their images under hq, abbreviating tail terms β(A) as +E and tail terms
id (B) as +G. We conclude that as long as factors lie in S, their image under hqµ2also has components
only in S.
In the product tables, the expression +G/H appears under the φπqkey. We have used this abbreviation
+G/H to denote the terms of πq(βα) according to Proposition 7.13. In other words, +G/H simply denotes
tail terms of the form α3+α4(B) and id (C).
8.3 Result components
In this section, we introduce our notion of “result components”. The reason for this notion is that
any evaluation hqµin a Kadeishvili tree may in principle yield a large number of terms. Any single of
these terms may yield multiple terms again upon the next evaluation in the tree. The notion of result

Figure 8.2: Possible result components of first-out disks in Kadeishvili trees
components serves to get grip on these terms. After the definition, we provide some terminology and a
few examples.
Before we state the precise definition, let us illustrate the idea: Regard an evaluation task like com-
puting (3 x+ 5y)(2x+ 3y) or even (3 x+ 5y)(2x+ 3y)(x−y). These evaluations can be represented by
the trees
3x+ 5y 2x+ 3y
6x2+ 19xy+ 15y23x+ 5y 2x+ 3y x−y
6x2+ 19xy+ 15y2
6x3+ 13x2y−4xy2−15y3.
The result expression 6 x2+ 19xy+ 15y2is concise, but does not include information on how it was
derived from the individual factors. The idea behind result components is to retain this information
instead. For example, the left tree should have four result components:
6x2derived from multiplying 3 xand 2 x, 9xyderived from multiplying 3 xand 3 y,
10xyderived from multiplying 5 yand 2 x, 15y2derived from multiplying 5 yand 3 y.
In other words, the left tree has four distinct result components, even though the result can be abbreviated
to only three terms. The tree on the right has just four result terms, while there are eight distinct result
components. For example, one of these eight result components consists of the choice of 3 xon the leftmost
leaf, 2 xon the middle leaf and −yon the rightmost leaf.
Let us prepare for result components of Kadeishvili trees: In contrast to the simple multiplication
trees above, the leaves of a Kadeishvili tree are labeled by deformed cohomology basis elements. These

elements consist of a finite or infinite amount of additive components . For example, let α3+α4denote
a certain cohomology basis element and assume both α3andα4have a tail each consisting of one type
E disk with βmorphisms denoted β1andβ2respectively. Then the deformed cohomology basis element
reads α3+α4+β1+β2and is defined to have four distinct additive components, even though technically
it may be possible that β1=β2.
Similarly, node evaluations in Kadeisvhili trees may yield a large amount of additive components .
For example, an evaluation hq(βα) may yield an expression like β+β1+β2+ id(B) according to Propo-
sition 7.13. This evaluation is defined to have four distinct additive components. In other words, an
additive component always refers to one of the main terms or a choice of one of the tail terms. We are
finally ready to define result components of Kadeishvili trees:
Definition 8.6. Therestriction of an h-tree or π-tree ( T, h 1, . . . , h N) at a non-root node P∈Tis
the h-tree from Pup to all leaves, together with the corresponding subset of ( h1, . . . , h N). A result
component of an h-tree or π-tree is defined inductively as follows:
•A result component of an h-tree with only one node consists of an additive component appearing
in the corresponding h1.
•A result component of an h-tree with at least three nodes consists of result components r1, . . . , r k
of the restrictions at the ordered children of the root, together with choices n0, . . . , n k≥0 ofδ
insertions, and an additive component appearing in
hqµq(δ, . . . , δ|{z}
nk, rk, . . . , r 1, δ, . . . , δ|{z}
n0).
•A result component of a π-tree consists of result components r1, . . . , r kof the restrictions at the
ordered children of the root, together with choices n0, . . . , n k≥0 ofδinsertions, and an additive

•Forπ-trees, the result components ( −1)#α3α3and (−1)#α4+1α4shall be grouped together as one
result component. Also, the result components id (D) shall be grouped together as one result
component.
•Additive components arising from different tail nodes in the evaluation of hqorφπqshall be kept
distinct as result components.
Adirect morphism is a result component of a one-node h-tree. A result component derives from
the result components r1, . . . , r k, and from all the result components they derive from themselves. A
direct morphism derives from nothing. A tail result component is one that comes from a tail additive
component of the final hqorφπqevaluation. Tail additive components of direct morphisms are also
counted as tail result components. Any other result component is a main result component . The
class of all result components of π-trees is denoted Result π.
Example 8.7. Regard an evaluation hq(βα). Its result consists of a tower of β(A) morphisms. They
need not be distinct as morphisms, but shall be treated as distinct result components. The β(A) with
the lowest qpower is the main result component, all others are tail result components.
Example 8.8. A sample π-tree with a concrete result component is depicted in Figure 8.4. The inputs of
thisπ-tree are four β3+β4morphisms, corresponding to the four intersection points between the zigzag
curves. One of the zigzag paths is denoted L. The first input morphism departs from Land the fourth
ends on L. The angles depicted are the main α4components of the first, third and fourth input, as well
as the first tail component of the second input. The double stroke on the rightmost arrow indicated the
separation between the first and the fourth morphisms of the sequence. In case the rightmost arc is the
identity location of the first/final zigzag path, then the output of the π-tree is the identity. Otherwise the
output vanishes. This identity result component is derived from the main components of the first, the
first tail component of the second, and the main components of the third and fourth input morphisms,
with n1= 3 many δ’s after the first morphism and n2= 2 many δ’s after the second morphism. This
example illustrates a nontrivial result component of a π-tree and shows how tail components lead to
results. In contrast, no single result component of this π-tree derives from the main components of all
four input morphisms.
8.4 Classification of result components
In this section, we provide a semi-explicit, inductive characterization of result components of Kadeishvili
trees. To understand what this means, recall from section 8.2 that only certain types of morphisms can
appear as result components. For each of these types, we will describe all possible in which it is derived
from simpler result components. This description is recursive, and has to remain so until we match result
components with pieces of smooth immersed disks later on.
For example, regard a result component α3of an h-tree. We are interested in how this α3can possibly
have been derived. A glance at the multiplication and disk tables 8.1 and 8.2, 8.3 reveals that it must be
a product hqµ2(α0, α4). In turn, we are interested in how α0andα4could have been derived. Another
glance at the multiplication and disk tables reveals that both are necessarily direct. We conclude that
any result component α3of an h-tree is necessarily the result component of the tree hqµ2(α0, α3+α4)
with leaves α0andα3+α4.
We have conducted this investigation for all types of morphisms, resulting in the classification of
Table 8.5. Let us explain here how to read this table: The first and second column specify a type of
result component. More precisely, the first column fixes the type of morphism. The second column sets
further conditions on the type of result component. For example, the second column may indicate that

Figure 8.12: Trees with α0as result component
only result components of h-trees shall be considered, or only tail result components of φπqµ≥3. The
third column then provides a list of ways in which a result component of the specified type can be derived.
For example, we have seen before that an α3result component of an h-tree is necessarily direct or
derived from the tree in Figure 8.6a. This is reflected in the fourth row of the classification table. As
another example, we read off from the table that an id (C) main result component of φπqµ2is necessarily
a result component of one of the four id (C) trees in Figure 8.11.
As a final example, our classification of β(A) tail result components of h-trees is relatively implicit:
These result components come from an evaluation hq(βα),hq(α4β),hq(β′α2) orhq(α3α4). These evalu-
ations produce a β(A),β(C),β′(C) or α3(B) main result component. The tail β(A) result component
then sits at the tail of these morphisms. In other words, whenever we encounter a tail β(A) result
component of an h-tree, we will make reference to its associated main result components for further
inspection.
Remark 8.9. Let us comment on two specific cases of Table 8.5: Both id (C) and α3+α4tail result
component of φπqµnecessarily come from a certain φπq(βα) evaluation. The result component βαitself
produces also main and tail result components from hq(βα). We will use this observation later as a tool
to abbreviate the construction of subdisks.
Remark 8.10. The figures referenced in Table 8.5 show more than only trees: They depict trees and
subdisks side-by-side. At present, the subdisks may simply be ignored and only trees count. We have
chosen this way of presentation to facilitate retrospection during the reading of section 9.
Lemma 8.11. The result components classification of Table 8.5 is complete: The named types of result
components can only be derived in the given way.
Proof. The checks are detailed in section C.1.
779 From trees to disks
In this section, we show how to transform a result component of a π-tree into a kind of smooth immersed
disk. Simply speaking, we draw all intersection points and connect them in a way dictated by the result
component. The result is a matching between result components and certain types of smooth immersed
disks. It leads to our main theorem which is a precise characterization of the minimal model H Lqin
terms of smooth immersed disks.
Result components
with inputs h1, . . . , h NCR, ID, DS, DW disks
with inputs h1, . . . , h NSubdisk mapping D
Our bijection between result components of π-trees and smooth immersed disks is denoted D. The
domain of the mapping Dis the set Result πof result components of π-trees. The precise terminology is
that Dsends a result component r∈Result πto its associated “subdisk” D(r). We define the mapping D
inductively over tree size, by also defining subdisks for result components of h-trees: If a result component
rderives from certain result components r1, . . . , r Ncloser to the leaves, then the subdisk of ris defined
by gluing the subdisks of r1, . . . , r N.
In section 9.1, we introduce a protocol which lays down how subdisks may be glued together along
handles. This way, subdisks of π-trees are closed disks, while subdisks of h-trees rather look like half
a disk. In section 9.2, we introduce a precise container class Disk SLmeant to capture the shape of
subdisks of π-trees. In section 9.3, we show explicitly how to draw the subdisk associated with a result
component. In section 9.4, we define the subdisk mapping D:Result π→Disk SLand classify its image.
The class of disks reached by Ddecomposes into four visually distinguished types: CR, ID, DS and DW.
In section 9.5, we finish our computational journey and state our precise description of the minimal model
HLq. In section 9.6, we state our main theorem. The proofs of intermediate classification results and sign
computations have been placed in Appendix C. We continue using the shorthand µ:=µq:=µAdd Gtl qQ,
see Remark 7.1.
9.1 The subdisk protocol
In this section, we introduce our protocol for subdisk handles. The purpose of this protocol is to give an
accurate description of the handles with which we will glue subdisks together. Recall from section 4.5
that every zigzag path Lcomes with an associated zigzag curve ˜L. The subdisk of a result component of
an h-tree should consist of a sequence of intersection points and segments of the zigzag curves involved,
filled with half a disk. While the intersection points and zigzag segments can be located anywhere on the
dimer, both endpoints of the sequence should be located near the value of the result component itself.
For a given type of result component, we wish that the endpoints follow a predictable pattern to facilitate
gluing of subdisks. The protocol presented here is meant to define this local pattern, although we will
give no precise definition what kind of object a subdisk of an h-tree is from a global view.
Remark 9.1. The subdisk protocol enjoys the following characteristics:
•The protocol applies to every type of morphism that can appear as result component of h-trees,
namely α3,α4,β/β′(C),α0,α′
0andβ(A).
•For each morphism ε:L1→L2of these types, the protocol defines a germ (small interval) of the
zigzag curves ˜L1and˜L2.
•Every germ comes with a handle . A handle is an indication which endpoint is its gluable outside,
and an indication which surface side is regarded as disk inside and which as disk outside.
With these characteristics in mind, the protocol is defined in Figure 9.1. The germ intervals are drawn
thickly, the gluable endpoints are drawn by dots and the disk inside is drawn hatched. Only β(A) comes
in two variants: a short and a long version. We use the short version for tail components of hqµ2and all
components of hqµ≥3, and the long version for direct morphisms and inputs of hqµ≥3. We will explain
the reason of this distinction in Remark 9.2.
Remark 9.2. The distinction between short and long version of β(A) protocol is due to a general phe-
nomenon of subdisks. Namely, we will glue subdisks together by prolonging and subsequently connecting
their handles. Sometimes, morphisms lie so close to each other that their handles connect without need
for prolongation. In fact, if we drew every β(A) result component as the long version, it would strictly
speaking not be possible to draw the right subdisks in some cases.

Figure 9.1: Subdisk protocol
The best example is Figure 8.7: The co-identities can be drawn one after another next to the connector
of the β(A) input. With a long version, we would have to shorten the connector before drawing the
co-identities. In convening a short and long version, we prioritized the convention that handles can always
be prolonged and never shortened.
Remark 9.3. The most easily imaginable result components come from discrete immersed disks hqµ≥3.
In these disks, some angles may be result components, while some are δ-morphisms. By the subdisk
protocol, the result components have handles assigned. These handles do not immediately connect to
each other. Instead, the result components lie apart by as many arcs as the number niofδ-morphisms
between them. To facilitate smooth connections, we need to connect the handles by means of the angle
cutting procedure laid out in Definition 4.29.
We are now ready to use the protocol for the first time:
Lemma 9.4. Letr1, . . . , r Nbe a sequence of result components ri:Li→Li+1. Assume the values of
these result components are the consecutive angles of a discrete immersed disk when complemented with
δ-morphisms. Then their subdisk handles and the cuttings of the δ-angles connect smoothly. Here, all
short β(A) handles shall be extended to long ones first.
Proof. The sequence of angles of the discrete immersed disk is a mix of result components and δ-
morphisms. To check that everything connects smoothly, it suffices to check two neighbors at a time.
These may be either two δ-morphisms, two result components, or one δ-morphism to the left or right of
a result component. The first case of two δ-morphisms is trivial.
The second case of two result components is checked in Figure 9.2. In this figure, all possible pairs of
consecutive disk angles are checked for smoothness.
The third case of one result component and one δ-morphism is an automatic feature of the subdisk
protocol. The example case of α3is depicted by dotted lines in Figure 9.1.
9.2 Shapeless disks
In this section, we introduce shapeless disks as a container type for subdisks of π-trees. Recall that we
intend to define a mapping between result components of π-trees and certain types of smooth immersed
disks. In the present section, we define a suitable codomain for this map. Our solution is a broad
container format, which we call shapeless disks. A shapeless disk consists of intersection points of zigzag
curves with curve segments in between, filled by a disk immersion up to reparametrization. The specialty
of shapeless disks is that intersection points may occur multiple times, with zero distance between each
other. The set Disk SLof all shapeless disks will serve as codomain of the map D:Result π→Disk SL.
Remark 9.5. In the definition of SL disks, it is essential that all cohomology basis elements are un-
derstood as intersection points between the associated zigzag curves. This correspondence is defined in
section 4.5. In particular, an identity id Lis viewed as the even intersection point of ˜Land its Hamiltonian
deformation ˜L′, located at the midpoint of the identity location arc a0ofL. The co-identity α0is viewed
as the odd intersection point between ˜Land˜L′, located at the midpoint of the chosen co-identity angle
α0. The Hamiltonian deformation ˜L′goes right of ˜Latα0and left of ˜Lata0, see Figure 9.3.
We are now ready to define shapeless disks.

Figure 9.4: These figures illustrate SL disks with a given number of N= 0,1,6 inputs. In the SL disk
with six inputs, the two zigzag paths L1andL2are supposed to be equal and the input h1is supposed
to be the co-identity of L1. The three inputs h2,h3,h4lie infinitesimally close to each other. The way
we have portrayed them is meant to imply L2=L4andL3=L5. The morphisms h2,h3,h4change back
and forth from L2toL5. Allowing this distinctive behavior is the reason for our definition of SL disks.
Definition 9.6. LetN≥0 and let L1, . . . , L N+1be a sequence of zigzag paths. Let hi:Li→Li+1be
cohomology basis elements. An SL disk (shapeless disk) consists of
•an output cohomology basis element t:LN+1→L1,
•a possibly empty ˜L1segment from ttoh1,
•for every i= 1, . . . , N a possibly empty ˜Li+1segment from hitohi+1,
•a possibly empty ˜LN+1segment from hNtot,
•an oriented polygon immersion D:PN+1→ |Q|up to reparametrization,
such that Dhas convex corners and traces the segments of ˜L1, . . . , ˜LN+1one after another. More precisely,
Dshall map the i-th corner to hi, the N+ 1-th corner to t, the edge between i-th and i+ 1-th corner to
the˜Li+1segment and the edge between N+ 1-th and 1st corner to the ˜L1segment, lying on the right
side of this chain of segments. The mapping Dneed not be an immersion on the boundary. The disk
may have infinitesimally small area. The class of SL disks is denoted Disk SL.
Remark 9.7. The notion of SL disks is depicted in Figure 9.4. We may refer to an empty segment
also as a segment of infinitesimally small length and say that the two endpoints of the segment are
infinitesimally close .
Remark 9.8. The definition of an SL disk entails the option of infinitesimally small area and empty
zigzag curve segments. It is impossible to draw these accurately, so we have opted to visually inflate every
infinitesimally small area and empty segments and draw them as substantial area and short but visible
segments in all drawings. While the definition of SL disks does technically not involve any Hamiltonian
deformations, we always draw co-identity and identity as switches from ˜Lto Hamiltonian deformation, see
Figure 9.3. We draw stacked co-identities as repeated switches from ˜Lto˜L′to˜L′′etc. with infinitesimally
small distance in between, in line with the Fukaya-theoretic viewpoint.
Remark 9.9. An SL disk is in principle allowed to have as few as zero or one inputs. An SL disk
without inputs is a monogon, an SL disk with a single input is a digon. Under the present assumption
thatQis geometrically consistent, an SL disk automatically has a minimum of two inputs. There are a
few exceptions: The monogon with infinitesimally small area, located at an arbitrary intersection point,
constitutes an SL disk without inputs. The digon bounded by two infinitesimally small segments of two
intersecting zigzag curves, located at a single intersection, constitutes an SL disk with a single input. The
digon bounded by a zigzag path and itself with input the identity and output the co-identity constitutes
an SL disk with a single input. For geometrically consistent Q, all SL disks with less than two inputs
have infinitesimal area. They are an artifact of the definition and will not be used.
9.3 Constructing subdisks
In this section, we define subdisks for most Kadeishvili trees. As announced, the procedure is an inductive
drawing construction, taking into account the way a given result component was derived. The reader has
encountered many subdisk drawings already, spread out over figures from section 8. Here we will explain
these drawings and add more.

the tail disks by cutting the δangles, continuing up until the given β(A) component. Finish with the
short subdisk version of β(A).

used in this higher product are δinsertions, β(A), β/β′(C), α3(B),α4(B),α0(D), α′
0(D). All of
them have subdisk handles assigned. Close all β(A) handles. Connect the handles of all morphisms
around the discrete immersed disk in clockwise order, following the δinsertions. Note that this produces
a smooth curve according to Lemma 9.4. Finish with the short version of β(A). An example is shown in
Figure 9.6a.
Aβ(A) tail result component of hqµ2orhqµ≥3.The corresponding main result component is a
β(A), β/β′(C) or α3. Now the subdisk of the β(A) tail result component is obtained by taking the
subdisk of the main result component, closing it if it is a β(A), and connecting it all the way around the
tail disk by cutting the δangles, continuing up until the given β(A) tail result component. Finish with
the short subdisk version. An example is shown in Figure 9.6b.
Anα3+α4main result component of φπqµ≥3.The disk is then one of Figure 8.2 or 8.3. In all
cases, connect the handles all around the disk as in the β(A) case. If the disk is first-out, cut the δangle
at the beginning of the disk. If the disk is final-out, cut the δangle at the end of the disk. Finally, close
the disk with an output mark. An example is shown in Figure 9.6c.
Anα3+α4main result component of φπqµ2.The entire tree is then one of those in Figure 8.8,

(A) appears as main result component of the hq(βα) evaluation and we have already assigned a subdisk
with short β(A) version to it. Now obtain the subdisk of α3+α4from the subdisk of β(A) by closing
the subdisk and connecting it all the way up around the disk by cutting the δangles, and finally finishing
with an output mark at the 2/5 arc of the G situation. An example for φπqµ≥3is shown in Figure 9.6d.

Remark 9.11. We have associated subdisks to all result components of all π-trees. Because they are
difficult to draw consistently, we do not assign subdisks to id (B) result components and id (D) result
components of h-trees.
The reader who has read the catalog of subdisk definitions may feel unsure what these subdisks
actually are. To ease his pain, we remind him that subdisks are specific collections of data defined in

trees, the two with id (C) right after the output mark are depicted here.
section 9.1 and section 9.2. Let us explain and record that the subdisks defined in the catalog actually
satisfy these conditions:
Lemma 9.12. Subdisks are well-defined. Subdisks of h-trees respect the subdisk protocol. Subdisks of
π-trees are SL disks, providing a map D:Result π→Disk SL.
Proof. This is easy and follows from induction on tree size. We shall not check all cases, but explain
the line of argument. The base case of induction are the subdisks of the direct morphisms, which are
depicted in Figure 9.5 and indeed respect the subdisk protocol.
As induction hypothesis, assume the subdisk of any result component of an h-tree with less than N
inputs already respects the subdisk protocol. Regard a result component rof an h- or π-tree with N
inputs. Assume ris derived from result components r1, . . . , r k. Each of these result components rihas
less than Ninputs and hence their subdisks respects the subdisk protocol.
According to the catalog, the subdisk of ris constructed by gluing or extending the subdisks of
r1, . . . , r k. At these points, the catalog typically invokes Lemma 9.4. This invokation is indeed possible
since r1, . . . , r kall respect the subdisk protocol. The final step of the catalog entry is to finish the drawing
somewhere near ritself. This step is indicated in individual pictures, from which it is evident that the
finish respects the subdisk protocol respectively is an SL disk. This completes the induction.
9.4 The four types of disks
In this section, we exhibit the image of D:Result π→Disk SL. More precisely, we group result components
ofπ-trees into four different types, according to the shape of their subdisk. These four types of result
components go by the name CR, ID, DS and DW result components. We will also define four types of
shapeless disks, which are meant to coincide with the image of these types of result components under
D:
Geometry Result component Shapeless disk
Degenerate strip DS result component DS disk
Degenerate wedge DW result component DW disk
Identity degenerate ID result component ID disk
Co-identity rule CR result component CR disk
Recall from section 9.3 that every result component of a π-tree comes with a subdisk assigned. All of
these subdisks are SL disks, but some are more special than others. For example, the subdisks depicted
in Figure 8.11 are all degenerate: There are two zigzag curve segments with infinitesimally small length.
In contrast, all segments in the subdisk in Figure 9.6e are nonempty. We exploit these differences in
subdisks to define four classes of result components:
Definition 9.13. A result component r∈Result πis a
•DS result component if it is the result component of one of the 8 trees of Figure 8.11.
•DW result component if it is the result component of one of the 7 trees of Figure 8.12.
•ID result component if it is a result component of one of the trees in Figure 8.10a or 8.10b, or
a result component of Figure 8.10c where the first angle of the discrete immersed disk is an α3or
the final angle of the disk is an α4.
•CR result component otherwise.
84out
co-identitiesco-identities
Figure 9.9: This picture depicts the schematic of CR disks. The specific CR disk depicted here has twelve
inputs, of which four are of type B or C and eight are co-identities. The eight co-identities come in two
stacks, each consisting of four co-identities lying infinitesimally close to each other.
The classes of DS, DW, ID and CR result components are denoted Result DS,Result DW,Result ID,Result CR⊆
Result πrespectively.
Remark 9.14. We have chosen the acronyms to reflect the amount of degeneracy allowed in the subdisks:
Subdisks of DS result components are “degenerate strips”. Subdisks of DW result components are
“degenerate wedges”. Subdisks of ID result components are “identity degenerate”, having an identity
output and one of the inputs lying infinitesimally close to it. CR are mostly regular and satisfy the
“co-identity rule”.
The remainder of this section is devoted to defining the notions of CR, ID, DS and DW disks. These
four classes are subsets of Disk SLand meant to be explicitly constructible: For every imaginable SL disk,
the reader should be able to determine whether it concerns a CR, ID, DS or DW disk or non of those.
Ultimately, we will prove that these very explicit classes of disks are precisely the images of Result CR,
Result ID,Result DSandResult DWunder D.
Definition 9.15. ACR disk is an SL disk all of whose segments are nonempty, with the exception that
multiple stacked co-identity inputs connected by infinitesimally short ˜Lisegments are allowed, as long as
their zigzag curve is oriented clockwise with the disk. The class of CR disks is denoted Disk CR.
Remark 9.16. The behavior of CR disks is depicted in Figure 9.9. We remark that in any CR disk,
whenever a co-identity appears in the angle cut just before or after an intersection of type B, it appears
only once due to arrow directions.
Definition 9.17. AnID disk is an SL disk satisfying the following conditions:
•The output is the identity of a zigzag path,
•Precisely one input, the degenerate input , is infinitesimally close to the output,
•The degenerate input is of type B or C,
•The disk becomes CR upon excision of the output and substitution of the output mark by the
degenerate input,
•In case of a degenerate B input, it precedes respectively succeeds the output mark if L1is oriented
clockwise respectively counterclockwise with the disk,
•In case of a degenerate C input, the source zigzag path of the degenerate input is counterclockwise
and the target zigzag path is clockwise.
The class of ID disks is denoted Disk ID.
Remark 9.18. The two conditions of Definition 9.17 specific to the B and C case can be formulated
in more relaxed terms. In case of a degenerate B input, the three zigzag paths given by the source
and target of the degenerate input and the output all have the same orientation. We can make the
precedence of degenerate input and output therefore dependent on any of the three, instead of L1. In
case of a degenerate C input, the requirement regarding orientations equivalently requires that the source
and target zigzag path of the degenerate input are always oriented “towards” the disk, instead of “away
from” the disk. This is visually depicted in Figure 9.10.

Figure 9.10: This picture depicts the schematic of ID disks, categorized according to whether the degen-
erate input is of type B or C. Each of the specific ID disks depicted here has nine inputs, of which five
are of type B or C and four consist of a stack of co-identities. The degenerate input is the one at the top
corner. For the case of degenerate B input, we have depicted both the clockwise and the counterclockwise
case. For the case of degenerate C input, we have depicted only the case where the degenerate input
precedes the output mark.
Definition 9.19. ADS disk is an immersed strip fitting into one of the two digons bounded by a zigzag
curve ˜Land its Hamiltonian deformation ˜L′. More precisely, the strip is a 4-gon bounded by ˜L,˜L′and
two (indexed) arcs aandblying on L. The arc bis the one lying closer to the co-identity. Two inputs
lie on the midpoint of the arc aand one input on the midpoint of the arc b. The output mark lies on the
midpoint of the arc b. There are corner cases in which additional conditions apply:
•Ifa=a0, then Lis oriented away from the co-identity.
•Ifa=b, then either (a) Lis oriented away from the co-identity and turns left at a=b, and the
input at the bside is odd/final, or (b) Lis oriented towards the co-identity and turns right at a=b,
or (c) Lis oriented towards the co-identity and turns left at a=b, and the bside input is odd/final.
•Ifa=b=a0, then both conditions must be met: Lis oriented away from the co-identity, turns left
ata=band the input at the bside is odd/final.
The class of DS disks is denoted Disk DS.
The behavior of DS disks is best observed in Figure 8.11. In the definition of DS disks, we have used
terminology that ˜Lmay be oriented towards or away from the co-identity. Indeed, a strip lies in the digon
between identity and co-identity. This brings a distinction whether ˜Lis oriented towards the co-identity
and away from the identity, or away from the co-identity and towards the identity. Of course, the whole
definition with its corner cases is designed to capture precisely the result components of Figure 8.11.
Definition 9.20. ADW disk is one of the following:
•A 3-gon sitting between a zigzag curve ˜Land its Hamiltonian deformation, bounded on one side by
an arc aofLand on the other side by the co-identity. The output mark is placed at the co-identity.
It is allowed that a=a0ifLis oriented away from the co-identity.
•A 4-gon, obtained from the first option by inserting an additional co-identity input infinitesimally
preceding the output. The condition is that Lis oriented away from the co-identity and that
a̸=t(α0).
•A 4-gon, obtained from the first option by inserting an additional co-identity input infinitesimally
succeeding the output. The condition is that Lis oriented towards the co-identity.
The set of DW disks is denoted by Disk DW.
The behavior of DW disks is best observed in Figure 8.12. The definition distinguishes three types of
DW disks. To be more precise with the conditions, observe that a DW disk the second type is allowed
to have a=a0while a DW disk of the third type is required to have a̸=a0. In the second type, the
arcais supposed to be not the tail arc t(α0) of the co-identity angle α0. In the third type, the assertion
a̸=t(α0) holds automatically, since the co-identity angle α0is located in a counterclockwise polygon of
QandLis supposed to be oriented towards the co-identity. All DW disks have infinitesimal area, but
precisely two nonempty zigzag segments. In fact, the distance between the midpoint of the arc aand the
midpoint of the co-identity angle α0is at least half an angle in size.
We have constructed the definitions of CR, ID, DS and DW disks such that the subdisk of a CR result
component is a CR disk, and so on:
86h2
h1
Figure 9.11: This picture explains that one expects only very few non-transversal disks among zigzag
curves in the Fukaya category. We depict a smooth immersed disk bounded by zigzag curves and assume
it has two transversal intersections h1,h2on the boundary which lie infinitesimally close to each other.
Due to the zigzag nature and transversality, h1andh2must be the even and odd intersection points
located at the midpoint of one single arc of Q. This means that the source zigzag path of h1is the target
zigzag path of h2and the entire disk is then very thin.
Lemma 9.21. The subdisk of a CR, ID, DS or DW result component is a CR, ID, DS or DW disk,
respectively.
Proof. The inspection is performed in section C.2.
In fact, we will prove and discuss later that our definition of CR, ID, DS and DW disks is also sharp:
Every CR, ID, DS and DW disk is actually reached as a subdisk of some result component.
Remark 9.22. It is very pleasant that most subdisks are rather regular in the sense that their zigzag
curve segments are non-empty. The only irregularities are found in stacked co-identities of CR and ID
disks, the degenerate output of ID disks, and the two irregular types of DS and DW disks. Viewed
geometrically, this is not really a surprise: In Figure 9.11 we argue that smooth immersed disks with
non-transversal intersections lying infinitesimally close to each other are very thin. The conclusion is
that within the Fukaya category, one expects only very few irregular disks between zigzag curves. The
DS and DW disks provide the exact representation-theoretic witness of this phenomenon.
9.5 The minimal model
In this section, we tie together the computation of H Lq: Its A∞-structure is defined in terms of π-trees.
All the result components of a π-tree can again be matched with CR, ID, DS and DW disks:
HLq
Minimal modelKadeishviliResult π
Result componentsDCR, ID, DS, DW
Immersed disks
This correspondence allows us to express the minimal model H Lqin terms of disks. The present
section is meant to spell out the details and provide intuition.
Our first step is to get more grip on the subdisk mapping D:Result π→Disk SL. We have already
seen in section 9.4 that Dsends CR result components to CR disks, and so on. In the following lemma,
we affirm that all CR, ID, DS and DW disks are actually reached by D.
Lemma 9.23. The classes of CR, ID, DS and DW result components are disjoint, as are the classes of
CR, ID, DS and DW disks. The subdisk mapping Dbijectively sends each of the four result component
classes to its disk counterpart:
Result CR˙∪Result ID˙∪Result DS˙∪Result DW
Disk CR ˙∪Disk ID ˙∪Disk DS ˙∪Disk DWD
∼ D
∼ D
∼ D
∼Result π=
Disk SL ⊆
Proof. The inclusions are checked and an explicit inverse map is constructed in Appendix C.
At this point, we can already describe the minimal model H Lqin a rigged way by means of disks:
Letrbe a result component of a π-tree. Then its subdisk D(r) comes with a designated output mark, in
particular we can read off its output morphism t( D(r)). In fact, the value of ris equal to t( D(r)), at least
when sign and q-parameters are stripped off. For example, a subdisk of an α3+α4result component has
output mark at this very same α3+α4morphism, by construction. Even though we currently have to
87recover signs and q-parameters from result component instead of disk, this enables us to largely describe
the product in terms of disks:
µN(hN, . . . , h 1) =X
r∈Result π
rhas inputs h1,...,h Nr
=X
D∈DiskCR˙∪DiskID˙∪DiskDS˙∪DiskDW
Dhas inputs h1,...,h ND−1(D)
=X
D∈DiskCR˙∪DiskID˙∪DiskDS˙∪DiskDW
Dhas inputs h1,...,h N(−1)sgn(D−1(D))qparam( D−1(D)) t(D).(9.1)
Here t( D) denotes the output morphism of the disk D, and sgn( r) and qparam( r) temporarily denote the
sign and q-parameter of a result component. As announced, the sign ( −1)sgn(D−1(D))andq-parameter
qparam( D−1(D)) in this formula are only recovered from the result component D−1(D) instead of D
itself.
Our next step is to write signs and q-parameters in terms of Dinstead of recovering them from
D−1(D). In fact, Lemma 9.25 will show that the sign is precisely the Abouzaid sign of D, which the
reader may recall from the context of Fukaya categories in section 4.1. Moreover, the q-parameter is
precisely the product of all punctures covered by D, counted with multiplicities. Before we make these
statements, let us fix the Abouzaid sign terminology in our present context:
Definition 9.24. LetDbe an SL disk. Then its Abouzaid sign Abou( D)∈Z/2Zis the sum of all #
signs around D, plus the number of odd inputs hi:Li→Li+1where Li+1is oriented counterclockwise
with D, plus one if its output t:L1→LN+1is odd and LN+1is oriented counterclockwise. The q-
parameter Punc( D)∈CJQ0KofDis defined as the product of all punctures covered by D, counted
with multiplicities.
Lemma 9.25. Letr∈Result πbe the result component of a π-tree. Then its sign is equal to the Abouzaid
sign of its subdisk D(r) and its q-parameter ∈CJQ0Kis equal to the product of all punctures covered by
D(r), counted with multiplicities:
In terms of r In terms of D
Sign sgn( r)∈Z/2Z Sign Abou( D)∈Z/2Z
q-parameter qparam( r)∈CJQ0K q-parameter Punc( D)∈CJQ0K=
=
Proof. Both checks can be performed in an inductive fashion. The signs checks are detailed in section C.8.
The checks for q-parameters are easier and left to the reader.
With the help of this lemma, we are ready to translate the rigged formula (9.1) into the soothing
description of the minimal model purely in terms of disks. For simplicity we denote the identity element
of a zigzag path Lby id L=P
aida.
Theorem 9.26. LetQbe a geometrically consistent dimer. Regard the category Lq⊆Tw′GtlqQof
deformed zigzag paths according to Convention 6.10. Then the A∞-structure of the minimal model H Lq
is described as follows:
•The curvature and differential vanish:
µ0
HLq=µ1
HLq= 0.
•The minimal model is unital: For every cohomology basis element h:L1→L2we have
µ≥3
HLq(. . . ,idL1, . . .) = 0 ,
µ2
HLq(h,idL1) = (−1)|h|µ2
HLq(idL2, h) =h.
•The products are given by CR, ID, DS and DW disks: Let N≥2 and let h1, . . . , h Nbe a sequence
of non-identity cohomology basis morphisms with hi:Li→Li+1. Then their product is given by
µN(hN, . . . , h 1) =X
D∈DiskCR˙∪DiskID˙∪DiskDS˙∪DiskDW
Dhas inputs h1,...,h N(−1)Abou( D)Punc( D) t(D).
88Proof. This is a summary of our journey. As we have observed earlier, the minimal model H Lqhas
vanishing differential and curvature. It is also unital with the same identities as L. When h1, . . . , h Nare
cohomology basis elements, the rigged formula (9.1) gives
µN(hN, . . . , h 1) =X
D∈DiskCR˙∪DiskID˙∪DiskDS˙∪DiskDW
Dhas inputs h1,...,h N(−1)sgn(D−1(D))qparam( D−1(D)) t(D)
=X
D∈DiskCR˙∪DiskID˙∪DiskDS˙∪DiskDW
Dhas inputs h1,...,h N(−1)Abou( D)Punc( D) t(D).
In the second row, we have inserted Lemma 9.25. This finishes the proof.
9.6 Main result
In this section, we present our main result. It ties together the “discrete relative Fukaya category” H Lq
and the “smooth relative Fukaya category” relFuk Q:
Discrete relative
(HLq)trSmooth relative
relFukpreQ|ObL
The starting point on the discrete side is the explicit description of the minimal model H Lqdue
to Theorem 9.26. The starting point on the smooth side is the explicit description of the subcategory
relFukpreQ|ObLfrom Corollary 4.39. The main result entails a strict isomorphism between the transversal
part (H Lq)tron one side and relFukpreQ|ObLon the other side. In what follows, we recall a few specific
properties of relFukpre|ObLand a few similarities with H Lq.
Remark 9.27. In section 4 we have elaborated on the construction of Fukaya categories. More specifi-
cally, we have defined the categories FukpreQ, Fuk Q, relFukpreQ, relFuk Qand their subcategories given
by zigzag curves. Most importanty, recall from Definition 4.23 that relFukpreQdenotes the relative
Fukaya pre-category of Q. In section 4.5, we have provided an extensive elaboration on how zigzag paths
can be interpreted as objects in relFukpreQ. In particular, a zigzag path L∈HLqcorresponds to a
zigzag curve ˜L∈relFukpreQ. Recall from Definition 4.31 that relFukpreQ|ObLis the A∞-pre-category
defined as the subcategory of relFukpreQgiven by zigzag curves ˜L, together with the spin structure
dictated by L∈L. As we have seen in Lemma 4.36, a sequence of zigzag curves ( ˜L1, . . . , ˜LN+1) is
transversal in relFukpreQ|ObLif and only if the zigzag paths Liare pairwise distinct. We have described
the subcategory relFukpreQ|ObLmore explicitly in Corollary 4.39.
Remark 9.28. In Lemma 4.34, we have identified basis elements for the hom spaces Hom FukQ(˜L1,˜L2)
with intersection points of ˜L1and˜L2. In case ˜L1=˜L2, the intersection points only refer to the transversal
self-intersections, plus the identity and co-identity self-intersections. In section 6.3, we have seen that
basis elements for Hom HL(L1, L2) are identified with intersection points between ˜L1and˜L2as well. In
case L1=L2, the intersection points only refer to the transversal self-intersections, plus identity and
co-identity self-intersections:
Category of zigzag paths Geometry Fukaya category
Zigzag path Zigzag curve Zigzag curve
L ˜L ˜L
Cohomology basis element Intersection point Basis element
h:L1→L2 p∈˜L1∩˜L2 p:˜L1→˜L2
Remark 9.29. As laid out in Lemma 4.35, the relative Fukaya category relFuk Qis a deformation of
FukQ. As such, its hom spaces are the B-enlargement of the hom spaces of Fuk Q, see also Lemma 4.35:
Hom relFuk Q(˜L1,˜L2) =Bb⊗Hom FukQ(˜L1,˜L2).
Similarly, H Lqis a deformation of H Lby construction. Its hom spaces are the B-enlargement of the
hom spaces of H L:
Hom HLq(L1, L2) =Bb⊗Hom HL(L1, L2).
The identification of the basis elements of Hom FukQ(˜L1,˜L2) and Hom HLq(L1, L2) provides an explicit
B-linear identification of the hom spaces Hom relFuk Q(˜L1,˜L2) and Hom HLq(L1, L2).
89In Lemma 9.30, we examine CR, DS, ID and DS disks in the case that the sequence of input zigzag
paths is transversal. The notable outcome is that only CR disks remain, which can in turn be interpreted
directly as smooth immersed disks. This establishes the desired link between the minimal model H Lq
and relFukpreQ|ObLwhich we will expand in Theorem 9.31.
Lemma 9.30. LetL1, . . . , L N+1be a sequence of zigzag paths in Qsuch that ˜L1, . . . , ˜LN+1is a transver-
sal sequence. Let hi:Li→Li+1for 1≤i≤Nandh:L1→LN+1be cohomology basis elements in H L.
Denote by pi:˜Li→˜Li+1andp:˜L1→˜LN+1the corresponding basis elements in Fuk Q|ObL. Then:
1. There are no ID, DS and DW disks with inputs h1, . . . , h N.
2. There is a bijection
Φ :nCR disks
with inputs h1,...,h N
and output ho∼− − − − − →nSmooth immersed disks
with inputs p1,...,p N
and output po
.
3. The Abouzaid signs agree: Abou( D) = Abou(Φ( D)).
4. The q-paramaters agree: Punc( D) = Punc(Φ( D)).
Proof. We explain the four statements one after another. For the first statement, let Dbe an ID, DS
or DW disk with inputs h1, . . . , h N. Then necessarily at least two of the zigzag curves L1, . . . , L N+1
are equal. Therefore ( ˜L1, . . . , ˜LN+1) is not a transversal sequence, in contradiction with the assumption.
This shows that there are no ID, DS or DW disks with input h1, . . . , h N. In other words, there can only
be CR disks with inputs h1, . . . , h Namong the four types of disks.
For the second statement, pick a CR disk with inputs h1, . . . , h Nand output h. Since all zigzag paths
L1, . . . , L N+1are pairwise distinct, the sequence h1, . . . , h Ndoes not contain any co-identities. Therefore
all zigzag curve segments involved in the CR disk Dare non-empty. This way Dimmediately constitutes
a smooth immersed disk in the sense of Definition 4.21. We denote this smooth immersed disk by Φ( D).
The smooth immersed disk Φ( D) has inputs p1, . . . , p Nand output p, precisely as desired. This sets up
the desired mapping Φ. The map Φ is clearly injective, since a CR disk contains as much information
about the polygon immersion D:PN+1→ |Q|as does a smooth immersed disk. For instance, the two
notions of CR disks and smooth immersed disks both identify immersions related by reparametrization.
The map Φ is also surjective, since a smooth immersed disk with inputs p1, . . . , p Nand output pcan
immediately be interpreted as a CR disk. This shows that Φ is a bijection.
For the third statement, let Dbe a CR disk with inputs h1, . . . , h Nand output h. According to
Definition 9.24, the Abouzaid sign Abou( D)∈Z/2Zis the sum of all # signs on the boundary of D,
plus the number of odd inputs hiwhere Li+1is oriented counterclockwise with D, plus one if the output
h:L1→LN+1is odd and LN+1is oriented counterclockwise. This is exactly the same as the definition
of the Abouzaid sign of Φ( D), see Definition 4.22 and 4.12. This shows Abou( D) = Abou(Φ( D)).
For the fourth statement, let Dbe a CR disk with inputs h1, . . . , h Nand output h. According to
Definition 9.24, the q-parameter Punc( D)∈CJQ0Kis the product of all punctures covered by D, counting
punctures multiple times if they are covered multiple times. This is exactly the same as the definition of
theq-parameter of Φ( D), see Definition 4.22. This finishes the proof.
Our main theorem shows that the transversal part of H Lqagrees with the subcategory relFukpreQ|ObL
of the relative Fukaya pre-category. For sake of logical independence, we repeat the setup here: The
starting point is a geometrically consistent dimer Q. We assume Convention 6.10. We denote by Lq⊆
Tw′GtlqQthe category of deformed zigzag paths according to Definition 7.3. We denote by H Lqthe
minimal model of Lq, described explicitly in Theorem 9.26. We denote by relFukpreQ|ObLthe subcategory
of the relative Fukaya pre-category of Q, described explicitly in Corollary 4.39. We denote by (H Lq)tr
the transversal part of H Lqwith respect to relFukpreQ|ObL, as defined in Definition 4.24. The notion of
strict isomorphism of deformed A∞-pre-categories is provided in Definition 4.25. Under this terminology,
we state our main theorem as follows:
Theorem 9.31. LetQbe a geometrically consistent dimer and assume Convention 6.10. Then there is
a strict isomorphism of deformed A∞-pre-categories
Fq: (HLq)tr∼− − − − − → relFukpreQ|ObL.
The functor Fqsends a zigzag path L∈HLqto the associated zigzag curve ˜Land a cohomology basis
element h:L1→L2to the associated intersection point p:˜L1→˜L2.
90Proof. This follows directly from Theorem 9.26, but we state the details. The starting point is the
description of the A∞-deformation H Lqof HLfrom Theorem 9.26 and the description of the A∞-
pre-category deformation relFukpreQ|ObLof FukpreQ|ObLfrom Corollary 4.39. We have detailed the
definition of the transversal part (H Lq)trwith respect to FukpreQ|ObLin Definition 4.24.
To construct the functor Fqaccording to Definition 4.25, we have to execute four steps: (1) to set
up a bijection between the objects of H Land FukpreQ|ObL, (2) to show that the transversal sequences
of (HL)trand FukpreQ|ObLagree under the bijection on objects, (3) to set up a CJQ0K-linear degree
0 isomorphism between the hom spaces of (H Lq)trand relFukpreQ|ObL, (4) to show that the higher
products of (H Lq)trand relFukpreQ|ObLagree under the identification of hom spaces.
For step (1), the bijection between objects of H Land FukpreQ|ObLconsists simply of mapping a
zigzag path L∈HLto its associated zigzag curve ˜L∈FukpreQ|ObL:
Fq: Ob(H L)∼− − − − − → Ob(FukpreQ|ObL)
L7− − − − − → ˜L.
For step (2), we have to explain that the transversal sequences of (H L)trare precisely the transversal
sequences of FukpreQ|ObLunder the identification of Lwith ˜L. In fact, this is immediate from the
definition of (H Lq)tras transversal part of H Lqwith respect to relFukpreQ|ObLunder the identification
ofLwith ˜L. Explicitly, a sequence ( L1, . . . , L N) in (H L)tris by definition transversal if and only if
(˜L1, . . . , ˜LN) is transversal.
For step (3), we have to set up a CJQ0K-linear identification between the hom spaces of (H Lq)trand
relFukpreQ|ObL. In order to define this identification, let ( L1, L2)∈(HL)2
tr. Then we have L1̸=L2.
We now set up the identification by sending a cohomology basis element h:L1→L2to its associated
intersection point p:˜L1→˜L2, as described in Remark 9.29:
F1
q: Hom (HLq)tr(L1, L2)∼− − − − − → Hom relFukpreQ|ObL(˜L1,˜L2)
h7− − − − − → p.
For step (4), we have to show that Fqpreserves the products of (H Lq)trand relFukpreQ|ObL. Pick
N≥1 and let ( L1, . . . , L N+1)∈(HL)N+1
tr. Pick basis elements hi∈Hom HL(Li, Li+1) and let pi∈
Hom FukpreQ|ObL(˜Li,˜Li+1) be the associated intersection points. We get

In the first row, we have inserted the description of µHLqfrom Theorem 9.26. In the second row, we have
pulled F1
qinto the sum and used that there are no ID, DS and DW disks with inputs h1, . . . , h Naccording
to Lemma 9.30. In the third row, we have turned the sum into a double sum ranging over the possible
output basis elements h. The notation h:L1→LN+1used is a slight abuse: The sum is intendend
to run over the basis elements h∈Hom HL(L1, LN+1). In the fourth row, we have re-enumerated the
summands as smooth immersed disks instead of CR disks. This enumeration uses the bijection Φ set up
in Lemma 9.30. In the fifth row, we have used that Φ−1(D) and Dhave the same Abouzaid sign and
q-parameter, according to Lemma 9.30. In the sixth row, we have inserted the definition of the products
of relFukpreQ|ObL, according to Corollary 4.39.
This proves step (4) and finishes the construction of the strict isomorphism Fqbetween (H Lq)trand
relFukpreQ|ObL. By construction, Fqsends Lto˜Land a cohomology basis element h:L1→L2to the
associated intersection point p:˜L1→˜L2. This finishes the proof.

Remark 9.32. The main result shows that H Tw Gtl qQis a candidate for a relative wrapped Fukaya
category. Also, the subcategory of H Tw Gtl qQgiven by Z/2Z-graded band objects is a candidate model
for relFuk Qin the sense of Definition 4.26.
It seems likely that H Lqis (gauge equivalent to) the subcategory of zigzag paths in (any model for)
relFuk Q. Our main result is however no guarantee for this, since taking subcategories and lifting pre-
categories to categories need not commute: Every subcategory of a lift is a lift of the subcategory, but
not the other way around. For further discussion we refer to section F.2.2.
A Examples
We provide here an example of a CR and an ID disk together with their matching result components.
The aim is to demonstrate in practice how one finds the preimage of a given CR or ID disk under the
subdisk mapping. The examples illustrate the strong geometric aspect of the subdisk construction and its
inverse construction. On the other hand, the examples demonstrate the sheer amount of case distinctions
and precision work required for reconstructing the result component from a given CR or ID disk.
A.1 ID disk
We present here an example pair of an ID disk and its matching result component. We depart from the
view of the ID disk and construct by inspection the corresponding Kadeishvili tree and result component.
The ID disk we present is very small. The reader can use this example to get a feeling how the presence
of the degenerate input and the small size of the disk are translated into the Kadeishvili tree.
The example ID disk is presented in Figure A.1. It is situated at a puncture with six incident arcs
and six incident polygons. Every pair of two neighboring incident arcs makes for a zigzag path, and the
smoothed zigzag curves ˜L1, . . . , ˜L6have six intersections around the puncture. These intersections alone
bound a hexagon.
Recall that every zigzag curve is supposed to have locations assigned of identity and co-identity
morphisms. In our example, the identity morphism of the sixth curve is supposed to lie on the curve’s
second arc when reading clockwise around the puncture. The disk we present makes use of this feature
in order to be a disk of ID type with six inputs and an identity output.
Let us explain precisely the data of this disk: The disk’s inputs are the six intersection points h1, . . . , h 6
of˜L1, . . . , ˜L6around the puncture, and the output is the identity of ˜L6. The identity output lies infinites-
imally close to the first input. More precisely, the first input is the degenerate input of this ID disk and
succeeds the output mark. The arcs are oriented so that ˜L1is oriented clockwise and ˜L6is counterclock-
wise with the disk. This turns the disk into an ID disk according to definition.
To interpret the meaning of this disk, we have to understand its features: First, the disk is very
small. The difficulty for us lies instead in the fact that the disk has no direct discrete analog: There is
no space between the arcs to form a higher product of Gtl qQ. The disk is however an ID disk and as
such has a nonzero value in our explicit model H Lq. Second, the disk is unpredictable in the relative
Fukaya category. Indeed, the sequence ˜L1, . . . , ˜L6,˜L1is not transversal. The disk even has an input
lying infinitesimally close to the output. All this means the higher product in the relative Fukaya is
unpredictable. The smallness and unpredictability features are nicely illustrated by the fact that the
simplest possible Kadeishvili tree φπqµ(h6, . . . , h 1) simply gives a zero result.
There exists is a single Kadeishvili π-tree that yields a nonzero output for the input sequence
h1, . . . , h 6. In fact, there is only a single result component, depicted in Figure A.2. We explain here
the precise data of this result component and why it is the only result component.

Step 1: Combining h5and h4:The deformed cohomology basis element h5is the sum of an arc iden-
tity and a β′(C) morphism. The deformed cohomology basis element h4is the sum of an arc
identity and a β(C) morphism. Combining both into the product µ2
q(h5, h4) gives the sum of two
terms, the first of which comes from the arc identity of h5and the β(C) morphism of h4, the second
comes from the β′(C) morphism of h5and the arc identity of h4. The product morphisms are both
situation A morphisms, the first is of type γβ(A) and the second of type βα(A). Applying the
codifferential hqto the first gives zero, since γβ(A) lies in the R-part of Hom Lq(L3, L5). Applying
of the codifferential hqto the second product gives a certain angle β45, depicted explicitly in the
figure. In summary, only the second term survives and is used for the result component.
Step 2: Combining with h3:The deformed cohomology basis element h3consists of an arc identity
and a β′(C) morphism. Combining with β45gives the product µ2
q(β45,id(C)) which is a situation A
morphism of type βα(A). Applying the codifferential hqgives a certain angle β345∈Hom Lq(L2, L5),
depicted explicitly in the figure.
Step 3: Combining with h2:Analogous to the previous step, gives angle β2345∈Hom Lq(L1, L5).
Step 4: Combining with h6:The deformed cohomology basis element h6consists of an arc identity
and a β(C) morphism. Combining with β2345gives the product µ2
q(id(C) , β2345) which is a situation
B morphism of type α2(B). Application of the codifferential hqgives the identity angle id(B) ∈
Hom Lq(L1, L6).
Step 5: Combining with h1:The deformed cohomology basis element h1consists of an arc identity
id (C) and a β′(C) morphism. Combining with id (B) gives the product µ2
q(id(B) ,id(C)) which is
the arc identity on the second arc of L6read in clockwise direction. By assumption, this second
arc is the identity location of L6. Application of the projection πqgives the identity morphism
idL6∈Hom Lq(L6, L6). This is the final result component of the Kadeishvili π-tree.
q-parameters: In the past five steps, we have ignored signs and q-parameters in the result component.
Theq-parameter in fact consists of the single puncture located at the center of the hexagon. This
parameter enters the result component in Step 1 by means of the β′(C) morphism of h5.
The result component described above and depicted in Figure A.2 is the only result component of
the sequence h1, . . . , h 6, at least as far as displayed in the figure. For the specific π-tree, the single result

qand all terms in their codifferential, apart from possible tail terms which lie far away and
are not visible in the figure. Other π-trees with the same input sequence h1, . . . , h 6do not yield any
result components. Indeed, one might for instance try to combine β2345with h1before combining with
h6. However, the product µ2
q(β2345,id(C)) gives a situation B morphism α1(B) whose codifferential
vanishes. This explains how the result component depicted in Figure A.2 is the only result component
and illustrates the delicate nature of matching disks with result components.
A.2 CR disk
We present here an example of a CR disk together with its Kadeishvili tree and result component.
The CR disk we present is depicted in Figure A.3. Its data has the following properties: There are
eleven input morphisms. The first is an odd morphism (type B), the second and fifth are even (type C),
the third and fourth are stacked co-identities, the sixth and seventh are odd (type B), the eighth is a
co-identity, the ninth is even (type C), the tenth and eleventh are stacked co-identities. The output is
an odd morphism (type B). In total, the boundary of the CR disk includes seven (in principle) distinct
zigzag curves.
The CR disk consists visually of three connected arms. It has a total of five indecomposable narrow
locations A, B, C, D, E. The narrow locations A, B lie on the first arm, the narrow locations C, D lie on
the second arm, the narrow location E lies on the third arm. The narrow tree is depicted in Figure A.4.
In the terminology of the narrow tree, the morphism h1lies below A and B. The morphisms h2,h3,h4,
h5lie below C and D. The morphism h6,h7,h8lie below E. The morphisms h9,h10,h11lie left-within
E. The narrow locations C and E are (direct) siblings in the narrow tree, indicated in the figure by a
dotted line.
The figure does not depict the entire dimer. In fact, the zigzag segments and narrow locations have

been depicted accurately, but the drawing misses some arcs. For instance, regard the puncture qwhich
is the connecting puncture of the narrow locations C and E. Simply put, qis the puncture just to the
right of h9,h10. The figure suggests there are seven incident polygons, preventing Qfrom being a dimer.
This explains that the visible arcs are not sufficient for the CR disk to exist and further arcs need to be
added in the interior of the CR disk.
According to Lemma 9.23, proved in section C.6, the CR disk is the subdisk of a single CR result
component. The construction of this result component is depicted in Figure A.5 till A.9. We explain the
construction as follows:
Step 1: Combining h5,h4,h3,h2:This step is depicted in Figure A.5. The morphisms h4andh3
are identical, namely a co-identity. Both consist of an α0and an α′
0term. Take the product
µ2
q(α0, α′
0). Applying the codifferential hqgives α′
0. The morphism h5consists of an id (C) and a β
(C) term. Take the product µ2
q(id(C) , α′
0). Applying the codifferential hqgives a β(C) morphism.
The morphism h2consists of an id (C) and a β(C) term. Take the product µ2
q(β(C),id(C)). This
gives a result of type βα(A). Applying the codifferential hqgives a β(A) main result component,
depicted without label in the figure. The codifferential also yields a β(A) tail result component,
labeled as such in the figure. The codifferential yields one further tail result component visible in
the figure, but we do not use it.
Step 2: Combining h8and h7:This step is depicted in Figure A.6. The morphism h8is a co-identity
and comes with terms α0andα′
0. The morphism h7is an type B morphism and comes with terms
α3andα4. Take the product µ2
q(α0, α4). Applying the codifferential hqgives an α3(B) main result
component.

Step 3: Combining h11,h10,h9:This step is depicted in Figure A.7. The morphisms h11andh10are
identical co-identities. Both consist of terms α0andα′
0. Take the product µ2
q(α0, α′
0). Applying
the codifferential hqgives an α′
0term. The morphism h9is a type C morphism and among others
consists of an id (C) term. Take the product µ2
q(α′
0,id(C)). Applying the codifferential hqgives a
β(C) result component.
Step 4: Assembly, part I: This step is depicted in Figure A.8. In this step, we combine the second
and third arm of the CR disk. On morphism level, we combine the result components obtained in
step 1, 2 and 3. We start as follows: Pick the result component β(C) from step 3 and the result
component α3(B) from step 2. Take the product µ8
q(β(C), δ, δ, α 3, α4, δ, δ, δ ). Here the letter δ
denotes inner and outer δinsertions. The result is a situation A morphism βα(A). Applying the
codifferential gives a term β(A). Now pick the β(A) result component stemming from step 1 and
take the product µ8
q(β(A), δ, δ, δ, β (A), δ, δ, δ ) of both. The result is a situation A βα(A) morphism.
Applying the codifferential hqgives a β(A) result component.
Step 5: Assembly, part II: This step is depicted in Figure A.9. In this step, we combine the second
and third with the first arm of the CR disk. On morphism level, we combine the morphism h1with
the result component of h2, . . . , h 11obtained in step 4. The morphism h1is a type B morphism
and consists of α3andα4terms, but also includes two β(A) tail result components. Of these two
tail result components, take the higher-order one and combine with the other result component β

The discrete immersed disk which computes this product is final-out. Its result includes an α3term.
Applying the projection πqgives the final α3+α4result component of the tree.
B Uncurving of band objects
In this section, we prove Lemma 5.11, which concerns uncurvability of band objects. It is our task to
explicitly construct a deformed twisted complex such that a given band object becomes curvature-free.
More precisely, the starting point consists of:
•a punctured surface ( S, M ),
•a full arc system Awith [NMDC],
•a standard deformation Gtl rAwhere r∈mZ(GtlA) is without 1-component,
•a band object organized in a twisted complex X= (⊕ai[si], δ),
such that the underlying curve of Xin the closed surface Sis not contractible and does not bound a
teardrop, and every connecting angle αiinδis longer than an identity and shorter than a full turn. It is
our aim to construct a deformation δq∈Hom1
Add Gtl rA(X, X ) such that Xq= (⊕ai[si], δq) has vanishing
curvature.
The present section is logically independent of the computation of the minimal model H Lq. However,
it builds directly on its methods in three ways: First, we introduce a notion of situations to characterize
types of angles between arcs of X, similar to the notion of situations for morphisms between zigzag paths.
Second, we build a protocol which describes what kind of angles we may encounter while gathering the
complementary angles, similar to the E, F, G, H disks or the subdisk protocol for zigzag paths. Third,
we build up the list of complementary angles in a recursive way, a bit similar to the way we work with
tails of morphims or subdisks for zigzag paths.
The idea to construct δqis to add not only complementary angles for all connecting angles αiofX,
but also complementary angles at locations where the strands of Xcome close to each other. An example
forXis depicted in Figure B.1. Apart from the complementary angles for the connecting angles αi,
this example requires four additional angles to be added to δq. In terms of the situational formalism of
section B.1, the four angles are of type id (A’), β(A’), β(A) and β(A).
In section B.1, we inspect the possible configurations of arcs and angles around Xand introduce
notions of situations. In section B.2, we define a temporary type of possible angles we may add in order
to produce δq, and investigate their possible products. In section B.3, we construct δqin a recursive way
and show that the curvature of Xq= (⊕ai[si], δq) vanishes.
B.1 Situations
In this section, we examine the possible configurations of arcs and angles along X. We capture these
types configurations in the notion of A, A’, A”, ID and D situations. The main difference with the notion
of situations for zigzag paths is that two different indexed arcs which are equal as arcs of Aneed not
determine an intersection of the underlying curve. For this reason, we obtain a slightly larger amount of
different situations.

Definition B.1. Regard the band object X= (⊕ai[si], δ). An indexed arc onXis a choice of arc ai,
remembering the index i. Ifaiis an indexed arc of X, then the strand ofXatairefers to the portion of
Xgiven by the neighboring indexed arcs . . . , a i−1, ai, ai+1, . . .. Anelementary morphism ε:ai→aj
onXis a single angle between two indexed arcs ai,ajonX, interpreted as ε∈Hom Add Gtl A(X, X ).
Thesource strand ortarget strand of an elementary morphism ε:ai→ajis the strand of Xatai
oraj, respectively.
Two angles in Awhich wind around a common puncture have an overlap if they contain a shared
indecomposable angle. Otherwise, the two angles are disjoint . For every indexed arc ai, the object X
contains a distinction whether Xturns left orright towards a given endpoint of ai.
Recall that an arc incidence at a puncture is slightly different from an arc incident at a puncture:
An arc incidence includes the datum whether it concerns the head or tail of the arc. A loop incident at
a puncture gives rise to two arc incidences. We generically denote a full turn by ℓ. We may call the αi
angles of Xalso the turning angles .
Definition B.2. We define the following types of situations on X:
•Atype A situation consists of a puncture together with incidences of two indexed arc aiandaj
such that (a) Xturns left at aitowards the puncture, and (b) Xturns right at ajtowards the
puncture, and (c) the turning angles do not overlap. The associated angles of the situation are
denoted α,β,γandβ′, as in Figure B.2b.
•Atype A’ situation consists of a puncture qtogether with incidences of two distinct indexed
arcsaiandajwhich are equal as arc of A, such that the strand of aiturns right at aitowards q
and the strand of ajturns left towards q. The associated angles are denoted α,β,γand id, as in
Figure B.2c.
•Atype A” situation consists of a puncture qtogether with incidences of two distinct indexed
arcsaiandajwhich are equal as arcs of A, such that the strand of aiturns left at aitowards q
and the strand of ajturns right towards q. The associated angles are denoted α, id,γ,β′, as in
Figure B.2d.
•Atype ID situation consists of a puncture qtogether with incidences of two distinct indexed arcs
aiandajwhich are equal as arcs of A, such that (a) the strand of aiturns left at aitowards q,
and (b) the strand of ajturns right towards q, and (c) the turning angles together form a full turn.
The associated angles are denoted α, id and γ, as in Figure B.2e.
•Atype D situation consists of a pair of consecutive arcs of X. It gives rise to αandα′angles:
A type αangle of Xis one of the αiangles of X. A type α′angle is one of the α′
iangles of X, see
Figure B.2f.

Remark B.3. When an angle comes from a situation of a certain type, we typically indicate the type
in brackets for clarity. For instance, a certain angle may qualify as a “ β(A) angle”. When working
with situations, we may from time to time indicate the situations by its associated angles, for instance
referring to a “type A situation ( αR, βR, γr, β′
R)”.
The difference with zigzag paths is that the arcs of Xare not oriented in the same direction, and the
α(D) angles are not necessarily indecomposable. Another important difference is that a zigzag segment
is never contractible, while a segment of Xmay be contractible. In our uncurving construction, we form
δqby inserting angles whenever a contractible segment lies “above” the angle. In order to make this
precise, we use the following terminology:
Definition B.4. For an A/A’/A”/ID situation, above refers to tracing Xin the opposite direction of
αand in the direction of γ.
The direction “above” in the situation figures Figure B.2b till B.2e is the natural upwards direction
on paper.
B.2 Uncurving protocol
In this section, we examine possible products which can be made from angles of A, A’, A”, ID and D
situations. The core tool is a notion of angles with balloons. The datum of balloons makes it possible
to safely examine possible products µ2andµ≥3
rbetween angles. All of the angles we later insert into
δqare of this type, but come with additional data which is irrelevant and not accessible at the current
stage of the construction. This way, angles with balloons serve as a “protocol” which greatly facilitates
the construction of δq.
The aim of the examination is to draw maximally strong conclusions on the configurations of arcs and
angles from the fact that the underlying curve of Xis not contractible and does not bound a teardrop.
The notion of angles with balloons is the cheapest way to incorporate this property of Xinto individual
angles. Angles with balloons are elementary angles whose Xstrand lying above the angle is contractible:
Definition B.5. Anangle with balloon onXis aβℓm(A/A’) or id ℓm(ID/A”) angle whose Xsegment
above βor id is contractible. We also count α(D) and α′ℓm(D) as angles with balloons.
101Angles with balloons are depicted in Figure B.3. The balloons facilitate a lot of tricks and desirable
properties. With the above/below terminology from Definition B.4, we can say that the balloon always
lies above the angle. Moreover, an id angle with balloon directly determines the turning directions of its
source and target strands:
Lemma B.6. Let id (ID/A”) be an identity angle with balloon. Then above, its source strand turns
left and its target strand turns right. Similarly below, its source strand turns right and its target strand
turns left.
Proof. In both ID and A” situations, the turning on the above side is predetermined. For the below side,
note that turning in the opposite direction would immediately constitute a teardrop in the underlying
curve of X, contradicting the assumption that there are no teardrops. This finishes the proof.
We now examine products and higher products of angles with balloons. When h1, . . . , h kare elemen-
tary angles, then an (additive) contribution to a product µk≥2
r(hk, . . . , h 1) is simply the product itself
in case k= 2, or an orbigon contributing to the product in case k≥3. As a first step, we can show that
when a higher product of angles with balloons are taken, no contribution to the higher product is all-in:
Lemma B.7. Leth1, . . . , h kbe a sequence of k≥3 angles with balloons. Then any contribution to
µk
r(hk, . . . , h 1) is first-out or final-out. At the concluding puncture, the first and final strands of Xboth
turn outside the disk and their turning angles are disjoint.
Proof. Regard a given contribution, denoted D. It is our task to show that Dis not all-in. We have
depicted a fictitious all-in contribution in Figure B.4a. With this figure, the reason that Dcannot be
all-in is immediate: All interior angles of the orbigon are angles with balloons. Correspondingly, the
k-many Xsegments above the interior angles are all contractible. Since the orbigon itself is contractible,
we conclude that the curve underlying Xis contractible, in contradiction with our assumption.
We conclude that every contribution is first-out or final-out. It is our task to show that the first and
final strands of the orbigon both outside the disk at the concluding puncture, instead of inside. This is
a standard argument concerning contractibility. We have depicted the desired situation in Figure B.4b.
Towards a contradiction, assume that one of the strands turns inside the disk. View the orbigon as a
bracketed discrete immersed disk. Denote the polygon immersion of the discrete disk by D:Pk→S.
Then at the concluding puncture, the strand of Xturns inside the interior of Pk. Tracing the strand
further, at some point it necessarily intersects itself or leaves Pk. This constitutes a teardrop for the
underlying curve of X, in contradiction with the assumption that Xhas no teardrop. This shows that
both strands turns outwards.
Finally, let us explain why the two turning angles outside the disk are disjoint. Indeed, if the two
turning angles outside the disk are not disjoint, the orbigon with its interior angles constitutes a teardrop
for the underlying curve of X, in contradiction with the assumption. This finishes the proof.
According to Lemma B.7, the situation around the concluding puncture of an orbigon gives rise
to an A/A” situation, which we call the concluding situation of the contribution. Thanks to this
characterization, we can inspect the contributions to µ≥2
r(hk, . . . , h 1) in more detail, depending on the
type of the angles h1, . . . , h k. We have expressed this inspection in Lemma B.8. There, we have detailed
only the statement of the first item, because the others statements are analogous and can be interpreted
from the figures.
Lemma B.8. Leth1, . . . , h kbe a sequence of angles with balloons. Let Dbe a contribution to the product
µ≥2
r(hk, . . . , h 1). Then Dcan impossibly concern a product of the type µ2(βℓm, βℓn),µ2(βℓm, α′ℓn),
µ2(α′ℓm, βℓn) or µ2(idℓm,idℓn). Instead, it falls under one of the following cases, and we make the
following refining statements:
•IfDconcerns a product µ≥3
r(βℓm(A), . . .) with βℓmfinal-out: Let ( α1, β1, γ1) be the angles associ-
ated with the situation of β. The concluding situation ( α2, β2, γ2) ofDis necessarily of type A.
The angles β1α1andα2are disjoint. Depending on the size of the angle between β1andα2, we
obtain a well-defined A situation ( αR, βR, γR) or an A” situation ( αR, γR, β′
R) (Figure B.5a).
•IfDconcerns a product µ≥3
r(βℓm(A’), . . .) with βℓmfinal-out: The concluding situation of Dis

In all cases, the βangle of the resulting A or A” situation comes again with a balloon.
Proof. Our first task is to show that there are no products of the type µ2(βℓm, βℓn). But this is obvious
from the definition and exactly the same as in the case of zigzag paths: The two βangles would need to
wind around the same puncture q. In order to have the product µ2(βℓm, βℓn),Xnecessarily turns right
atqwhen viewed from βℓm, but needs to turn left when viewed from βℓn. This shows there is no product
µ2(βℓm, βℓn). Similarly, there are no products µ2(α′ℓm, βℓn) and µ2(βℓm, α′ℓn). It is also easy to see
that there is no product of type µ2(idℓm,idℓn). Indeed, from Lemma B.6 we obtain two contradicting
statements regarding the turning of the target strand of the first, equivalently source strand of the second
identity.
Let us now filter out a few possible contributions to higher products. Thanks to Lemma B.7, we
already know that there are no all-in contributions. Furthermore, the two strands both turn outside the
disk, so there are no options to form a µ≥3
r(α, . . . ) orµ≥3
r(. . . , α ) product.
We now dedicate ourselves to working through the list of viable products and verifying their properties.
We highly recommend taking the figures as a visual aid for the arguments.
We start by regarding a result Dof a product µ≥3
r(βℓm(A/A’) , . . .) with βℓmfinal-out. The strand of
the first arc of the orbigon turns right at the concluding puncture. Its turning angle is clearly at most as
long as the remaining part of β, because otherwise the orbigon Dand the balloon of βwould constitute a
teardrop. We obtain a well-defined child: If the turning angle is strictly shorter, we obtain an A situation.
If the turning angle is equally long, we obtain instead an A” situation. In both cases, the resulting βR
or id Rcomes with a balloon, obtained as the joining of the balloon of βand the orbigon D. The case of
µ≥3
r(. . . , β ) with βfirst-out is very similar to the case of µ≥3
r(β, . . . ).
Regard now a result Dof a product µ≥3
r(α′ℓm, . . .) with α′ℓmfinal-out or µ≥3
r(. . . , α′ℓm) with α′ℓm
first-out. The either case, we obtain an A or A” situation at the concluding puncture by Lemma B.7. In
case of final-out α′ℓm, the result Dis of the form βRαRℓm(A) or αRℓm(A”). In case of first-out α′ℓm,
the result Dis of the form γRβRℓm(A) or γRℓm(A”). In either case, the βRor id Rangle of the resulting
situation comes with a balloon.
Now regard a product µ2(βℓm(A/A’) ,idℓn). By definition, the identity comes with a balloon. The
βangle does not wind around the above end of id, but around the below end of id, because the target
strand of id turns right at the above puncture, rendering a composition with βimpossible. Next, we
note that the target strand of the identity turns right at the below side of the source strand and the
turning angle is at most β, for otherwise the combination of the balloons of the identity and βwould
constitute a teardrop. As a result, space remains for defining a type A situation ( αR, βR, γR) or type A”
situation ( αR,idR, γR, β′
R). Its βRor id Rangle comes with a balloon again, namely the combination of
the balloons of βand id. The case of µ2(idℓm, βℓn(A/A’)) is similar.
For the products µ2(α, α′ℓm) and µ2(α′ℓm, α), we are not supposed to define anything. Note that it
is clear that for this product to exist, αandα′need to be precisely complementary angles. For a product
µ2(βℓm(A/A’) , α) orµ2(α, βℓm(A/A’)), it is interesting to note that αmust be the αorγangle from
the same situation as β. This finishes the proof.
B.3 Flowers
In this section, we construct the deformed twisted differential δqwhich uncurves X. We start by intro-
ducing flowers, a combinatorical gadget that recursively keeps track of all contractible segments of X.
Such a flower includes by construction all the terms we need to insert into δq. More precisely, we define
δqas the sum over the values of all flowers of Xand show that Xq= (⊕ai[si], δq) is indeed curvature-free.
Flowers of X Terms for δq
The core idea of our construction is best explained as follows. We start with δqcontaining only the
angles αiand their complements rℓ−1α′
i. This already makes µ0
Xandµ2(δq, δq) cancel, however we get
a potentially unlimited amount of orbigon contributions from µk≥3
r(δq, . . . , δ q). For each of these terms,
we need to insert an additional term into δqin order to make it cancel out. The new terms inserted into
δqhowever can give rise to further disturbing terms in µk≥3
r(δq, . . . , δ q) and we need to iteratively repeat
this process.

Figure B.6: Illustration of flowers
In every step of the process, we should remember the entire history of how a given term was formed,
much like the notion of tails or result components for zigzag paths. The tool of flowers which we define
here systematically keeps track of the appearing terms. Since a term typically appears recursively for
every orbigon that can be formed from already existing terms, the orbigons get stitched together much
like a flower. All the terms we insert into δqcome from orbigons, in particular we can ensure inductively
that they come naturally with balloons. This way Lemma B.8 applies and facilitates the friction-free
definition of flowers.
Not only orbigons need to be taken into account. It is possible that at the concluding puncture of an
orbigon, the two strands which were separated by the orbigon now come together and keep traveling in
parallel for a while, as in Figure B.6a. On such occasions, we have to insert a whole sequence of identities
intoδq. After a while, the two strands may separate again and wildly continue forming orbigons.
The rule of thumb could be memorized as follows:
•id (A”) needs to be inserted when the strands come together.
•id (ID) needs to be inserted when the strands keep running together.
•β(A’) needs to be inserted when the strands separate.
•β(A) needs to be inserted when the strands come together and immediately separate again.
The construction of flowers is so technical because of the large amount of complexity observed while
constructing δq. Explicitly, it concerns the following complications: First, segments of Xcan bound
multiple orbigons. This makes that there is no linear way of enumerating the terms we need to add to
δq. Instead, the terms will “cross-pollinate” each other. Second, for every orbigon that can be made of
terms already present in δq, we typically add a new β(A) angle to δq. This βangle already creates two
new products µ2(β, α) and µ2(γ, β). Cancelling them entails working with four terms in total. Third,
the identities need separate creation and cancellation procedures.
Remark B.9. We write
r=X
m≥1
q∈Mrq,mℓm
q∈mZ(GtlA).
Recall that an orbigon Dcomes with a deformation parameter rD. The element rDlies in the deformation
base Band is defined as the product of all rq,mranging over all orbifold points of D.
Definition B.10. Aflower comes with the datum of an concluding situation , which is an A, A’, A”
or ID situation. A flower always comes with the datum of a value , which is a B-multiple of id ℓm(A”),
idℓm(ID), βℓm(A) or βℓm(A’) for some m≥0, depending on the type of the concluding situation.
We distinguish five types of flowers, namely αflowers, α′flowers, orbigon flowers, ID stem flowers
and compound flowers. The orbigon flowers remember which flowers their orbigon is made of and the
compound flowers each remember which flowers they form a compound of. The complete recursive
definition of flowers is given in the catalog below. Wherever a flower Fis operated on in a formula, its
value is meant.
αflowers: Anyα(D) angle of Xdetermines a flower F.
105•The concluding situation of Fis the type D situation determined by α.

α′flowers: Any complementary angle α′ℓm−1(D) with m≥1 determines a flower F.
•The concluding situation of Fis the type D situation determined by α′.
•The value of Fisrq,mα′ℓm−1.
Orbigon flowers: LetF1, . . . , F kbe a sequence of flowers, together with the datum of a type A situation
(αR, βR, γR, β′
R) or a type A” situation ( αR,idR, γR, β′
R), two integers m≥0 and n≥1 and an
orbigon Dwhose interior angles are the values of F1, . . . , F ktogether with β′
Rℓm. Then this data
defines a new flower F.
•The concluding situation of Fis the type A situation ( αR, βR, γR, β′

•The value of Fis a multiple of βRℓn(A) or id Rℓn(A”), depending on whether the concluding

ID stem flowers: LetF1be a flower whose concluding situation is an ID situation (id R, αR, γR) or an
A” situation ( αR,idR, γR, β′
R). Depending on whether the source and target strands of id Rseparate
below the situation, we obtain a new A’ situation ( αS, βS, γS) or ID situation ( αS,idS, γS). Let F2
be an α′flower whose value is the complement of γS. This defines a new flower F.
•The concluding situation of Fis the A’ situation ( αS, βS, γS) or the ID situation ( αS,idS, γS).

Compound flowers: LetF1, . . . , F kbe a sequence of k≥2 flowers of ID stem or orbigon type with
concluding situations ( αi, βi, γi) (A/A’), such that (a) αiagrees with γi+1and (b) the angle β′
R
given by the union of the β′
i(or id i) angles, including all αiandγi, is at most a full turn. Then
this data defines a new compound flower F.
•The concluding situation of Fis the type A or A” situation ( αR, βR, γR, β′
R) or (αR,idR, γR, β′
R)
which contains the β′
Rjust constructed.
•The value of Fis a multiple of βRℓn(A) or id Rℓn(A”), depending on whether the concluding
situation is of type A or A”. To determine the precise coefficient, we shall use a trick by
applying recursion. Regard the flowers F1, . . . , F k−1. In case k= 2, this is the single ID stem
or orbigon flower F1,1:=F1. In case k≥3, this sequence determines a (smaller) compound
flower F1,k−1. In either case, we can assume that we already know the value of F1,k−1.
We distinguish two similar cases: Assume Fkitself is an orbigon flower whose interior angles
come from the flowers G1, . . . , G l. Let m≥0 be such that β′
Rℓmtogether with G1, . . . , G lare
the interior angles of the orbigon Fk. Then we define the value of Fas

j=1∥Gj∥+∥βR∥∥αR∥+|αR|F1,k−1(β′

Assume otherwise that Fkitself is an ID stem flower. Then we define the value of Fas

Figure B.7: Compound cancellation
With this sophisticated construction of flowers, we can define δqsimply as the sum over the values of
all flowers of X:
Definition B.11. We put
δq=X
Fflower of XF∈Hom1
Add Gtl rA(X, X ).
Lemma B.12. The element δqis well-defined and its leading term is δ.
Proof. Let us explain why δqis well-defined. The first observation is that there are only finitely many
orbigons for a given sequence of interior angles. In conclusion, for any C > 0 there is only a finite number
of flowers Ffor which it has taken at most Crecursive steps to define F. The second observation is that
the value of any flower lies in a certain power of the maximal ideal m⊆B. Every time a new flower is
formed, its m-adic exponent increases. Together, both observations show that the series which defines δq
converges in the m-adic topology.
It is very easy to see that the leading term of δqisδ: The only flowers whose value does not lie in a
power of the maximal ideal are the αflowers. Since δis just the sum of all αflowers, this finishes the
proof.
We aim at showing thatP
k≥0µk
Add Gtl rA(δq, . . . , δ q) = 0. In order to flexibly cancel terms in this
sum, we introduce an obvious notion of result components:
Definition B.13. Aresult component ofP
k≥0µk
Add Gtl rA(δq, . . . , δ q) consists of a sequence of k≥0
flowers F1, . . . F ktogether with an additive component of µk
Add Gtl rA(Fk, . . . , F 1). More precisely,
•fork= 0 this entails the curvature µ0
X,
•fork= 2 this entails a nonvanishing product µk
Add Gtl rA(Fk, . . . , F 1),
•fork≥3 this entails a choice of orbigon contributing to µk
Add Gtl rA(Fk, . . . , F 1).
Proposition B.14. We haveP
k≥0µk
Add Gtl rA(δq, . . . , δ q) = 0. Therefore Xq= (⊕ai[si], δq) is curvature-
free.
Proof. We shall provide a list of cancellations and then check that every result component is contained
in this list. We essentially distinguish two types of cancellations, namely the simple and compound
cancellations. A sample compound cancellation is depicted in Figure B.7. The precise list of cancellations
reads as follows:
•The curvature µ0
Xand the µ2(α, α′) and µ2(α′, α) result components.
•simple cancellation : Let F1, . . . , F kbe a sequence of flowers. Furthermore, let ( αR, βR, γR, β′
R)
be an A situation or ( αR, β′
R, γR) be an A” situation. Then for every orbigon Dwith interior angles
F1, . . . , F k, β′
Rℓm, we have the cancellation
µk
Add Gtl rA(Fk, . . . , F 1, α′
Rℓm+n) +µk
Add Gtl rA(γ′
Rℓm+n, Fk, . . . , F 1) = 0 .
By abuse of notation, we have written µ(. . .) where we actually refer to the contribution of the very
specific orbigon D. We have also denoted by α′
R(D) and γ′
R(D) the complementary angles of αR
andγR, in the sense that α′
RαR=ℓ=γ′
RγR.
107•compound cancellation : Let Fbe a compound flower consisting of flowers F1, . . . , F k.
Denote by G1, . . . , G lthe flowers that the flower Fkis derived from, and by H1, . . . , H nthe flowers
that F1is derived from. Denote the concluding situation of Fiby (αi, βi, γi, β′
i) or ( αi, βi, γi,idi),
depending on whether it concerns an A situation or an A’ situation.
Regard the compound flower F1,k−1consisting of F1, . . . , F k−1and the compound flower F2,kcon-
sisting of F2, . . . , F k. In case k= 2, the flowers F1,1=F1andF2,2=F2are simply ID stem or
orbigon flowers, instead of compound flowers. Either way, we have the cancellations
µ≥3
Add Gtl rA(F1,k−1, Gl, . . . , G 1) +µ2
Add Gtl rA(F, αk) = 0 ,
µ≥3
Add Gtl rA(Hn, . . . , H 1, F2,k) +µ2
Add Gtl rA(γ1, F) = 0 .(B.1)
By abuse of notation, µ(F1,k−1), . . .) actually refers to the specific orbigon given by Fk. Similarly,
µ(. . . , F 2,k) refers to the specific orbigon given by F1.
In (B.1), we have silently assumed that F1andFkare orbigon flowers. In case F1is instead an ID
stem flower, the term µ≥3
Add Gtl rA(. . . , F 2,k) should read µ2(id1, F2,k) instead. Similarly, in case Fk
is an ID stem flower, µ≥3
Add Gtl rA(F1,k−1, . . .) should read µ2(F1,k−1,idk) instead.
Finally, let us explain why all possible result components ofP
k≥0µk
r(δq, . . . , δ q) are captured in the
above cancellation list. Indeed, all results of flowers naturally come with balloons. Therefore Lemma B.8
applies and any result component falls under one of the following cases:
•Regard a contribution Dtoµk≥3(βℓm(A/A’) , . . .) with βℓmfinal-out or µk≥3(. . . , βℓm(A/A’)) with
βℓmfirst-out. By construction, βcomes from the concluding situation of a flower. Whether
it concerns an orbigon, ID stem or compound flower, the two terms fall under the compound
cancellation.
•Regard a contribution Dtoµk≥3(α′ℓm(D), . . .) with α′ℓmfinal-out or µk≥3(. . . , α′ℓm(D)) with α′ℓm
first-out. Then all the other interior angles of the orbigon are also the values of flowers and Dfalls
directly under the simple cancellation.
•A contribution µ2(βℓm(A/A’) ,idℓn) orµ2(idℓm, βℓn(A/A’)) falls under the compound cancellation.
•A contribution µ2(α′ℓm(D),idℓn) orµ2(idℓm, α′ℓn(D)) falls under the compound cancellation.
•Regard a contribution µ2(α(D), βℓm(A/A’)) or µ2(βℓm(A/A’) , α(D)). Let Fbe the flower that β
comes from. Depending on whether Fis an orbigon or ID stem flower or a compound flower, the
term falls under the simple or compound cancellation.
This shows that all terms have been canceled. It is a basic inspection that all terms have been canceled
only once. This shows thatP
k≥0µk
Add Gtl rA(δq, . . . , δ q) = 0 and finishes the proof.
C Classification of result components
We collect here a few deferred proofs: In section C.1, we prove Lemma 8.11 which classifies result
components. In section C.2, we prove Lemma 9.21 which concerns subdisks of CR, ID, DS and DW
result components. We spend section C.3 till C.7 with a proof of Lemma 9.23 which classifies the image
ofD. In section C.8, we prove Lemma 9.25 concerning the signs of result components.
C.1 Shape of result components
We prove here Lemma 8.11, which claims that Table 8.5 is an exhausting classification of result com-
ponents. Recall the situation: We are given a result component of an h- or π-tree and are supposed to
analyze how it is derived. It is not necessary to find the entire tree it is derived from, but only so far
that we recognize it fits the scheme of Table 8.5. We will now go through Table 8.5 case-by-case:
α0, id (C), α4from h-trees: Note that α0and id (C) belong to Hand hence only appear as direct mor-
phism or result component of a π-tree. Also, α4does not appear in the disk and multiplication
tables as result component of an h-tree and therefore any α4is either direct or a result component
of aπ-tree in combination with α3.
α3from h-trees: The angle α3does not appear in the disk table as result component of a disk hqµ≥3.
Whenever it appears as the result component of a product hqµ2, it must be as hqµ2(α0, α4) and
the involved α0andα4are direct.
108α′
0from h-trees: The angle α′
0only appears in the disk and multiplication table as hqµ2(α0, α′
0). The α0
involved is necessarily direct, and inductively we conclude that the α′
0is the result component of
one of the trees of Figure 8.6b.
β(C) from h-trees: The angle β(C) is necessarily direct or the result component of hqµ2(id(C) , α′
0). The
id (C) is necessarily direct and we already know α′
0is the result component of one of the trees in
Figure 8.6b.
β′(C) from h-trees: Same as β(C).
β(A) from h-trees: It appears as tail component in the deformed cohomology basis elements by Propo-
sition 7.12. It appears as tail component of α3andα4in the deformed version of ( −1)#α3α3+
(−1)#α4+1α4, and as tail component of β(C) and β′(C) in the deformed version of id (C).
β(A) main result component of hqµ≥3: Its classification follows directly from the disk tables 8.2 and 8.3.
Note that an all-in disk does not produce a β(A) result component either.
β(A) main result component of hqµ2: According to Table Table 8.1, this product is either of the type
hqµ2(β(A), α0),hqµ2(β(A),id(C)) or hqµ2(β/β′(C),id(C)). In the first two cases, we inductively
trace the β(A) involved. In the third case, note that we already know the entire tree of β/β′(C).
Ultimately, we end up either with β(C) or β′(C) or a β(A) that is a direct, hqµ≥3or tail hqµ2
result component, plus multiple compositions with α0or id (C) on the right. All three kinds of
trees are depicted in Figure 8.7.
β(A) tail result component: If it is the tail result component of an hqµ2, then it is necessarily one of the
tail result components marked by +E in Table 8.1. All options come with a corresponding main
result component β(A),β/β′(C) or α3. If it is the tail result component of an hqµ≥3, then it is
the result component of one of the final-out disks in Figure 8.3 and comes with a corresponding β
(A).
id (D) result component of an h-tree: According to the disk and multiplication tables, this concerns a
product hqµ2(id(C) , α4) or hqµ2(α3,id(C)). The α4and id (C) involved are necessarily direct.
Furthermore, the α3is direct or the result component of hqµ2(α0, α4). In the latter case, we
conclude that µ2(α3,id(C)) equals the co-identity α0itself, and therefore hqµ2(α3,id(C)) vanishes.
The id (D) is therefore necessarily a result component of hqµ2(id(C) , α4) orhqµ2(α3,id(C)) with
all involved α3,α4or id (C) being direct.
id (B) result component of an h-tree: According to the disk and multiplication tables, this is a first-out
disk or one of the trees in Figure 8.9.
α3+α4main result components of φπqµ≥3: Obvious.
α3+α4main result component of φπqµ2: It necessarily concerns a result component of a product of the
type φπqµ2(id(C) , β(A)), φπqµ2(β(A),id(C)), φπqµ2(id(D) , α4) orφπqµ2(α4,id(D)). The first and
second case are depicted in Figure 8.8. The third and fourth case are depicted in Figure 8.11.
α3+α4tail result component of a π-tree: It comes either from the G components in Figure 8.3 or from
the G components in Table 8.1. In all cases, this concerns a tail component of a certain φπq(βα).
Then the corresponding hq(βα) indeed has a corresponding β(A) main result component.
id (C) main result component of φπqµ2: It comes from a product µ2(id(C) ,id(D)) or µ2(id(D) ,id(C)).
Since this id (D) is necessarily the result component of the tree in Figure 9.7a or 9.7b, we obtain
the four id (C) trees in Figure 8.11.
id (C) main result component of φπqµ≥3: It comes from an all-in disk where the first zigzag path turns
right at the concluding arc and the final zigzag path turns left at the concluding arc. An example
is depicted in Figure 9.6e.
id (C) tail result component of a π-tree: It comes either from the H components in Figure 8.3 or from
the H components in Table 8.1. In all cases, this concerns a tail component of a certain φπq(βα).
Then the corresponding hq(βα) indeed has a corresponding β(A) main result component.
id (D) result component of a π-tree: It is either (a) the φπqµ≥3of an all-in disk with equal first and final
zigzag path, or (b) the result component of φπqµ2(id(C) ,id(B)) or (c) φπqµ2(id(B) ,id(C)) or (d)
φπqµ2(id(D) ,id(D)). Option (d) is impossible, since nonvanishing of φπqµ2(id(D) ,id(D)) implies
that both identities involved are the identity id a0at the zigzag path’s identity location, which is in
contradiction to the fact that this involved id (D) lies in R. Options (a), (b) and (c) are possible and
depicted in Figure 8.10. Note the id (B) component involved in (b) and (c) can impossibly come
from µ2(β/β′(C),id(C)) or µ2(β(A), α0), because the arrow directions along the disk mismatch
resp. because the arrow direction of α0contradicts Convention 6.10. This is reviewed in Figure 9.8.
109α0result component of a π-tree: A glance at the multiplication and disk tables reveals that it comes from
a product πqµ2(id(C) , α4) orπqµ2(α3,id(C)) or πqµ2(α0,id(D)) or πqµ2(id(D) , α0). In the first case,
both inputs are necessarily direct. In the second case, id (C) is definitely direct. Meanwhile, α3
may be direct or come from hqµ2(α0, α4) with both α0andα4direct. In the third and fourth case,
α0is direct. Meanwhile, id (D) may come from hqµ2(α3,id(C)) or hqµ2(id(C) , α4) with both α3/α4
and id (C) direct. This results in 7 options in total, depicted in Figure 8.12.
We have checked all cases of Table 8.5. This finishes the proof of Lemma 8.11.
C.2 The shape of subdisks
In this section, we prove Lemma 9.21: Subdisks of CR, ID, DS and DW result components are CR, ID,
DS and DW disks, respectively.
Lemma C.1. Subdisks of a CR result components are CR disks: D(Result CR)⊆Disk CR.
Proof. Letrbe a CR result component. We show that D(r) is a CR disk. First, the corners of D(r)
are convex by construction. Second, since the subdisk is obtained from gluing smaller subdisks, this
inductively provides that D(r) is indeed the boundary of some immersed disk. Third, stacked co-identities
lie infinitesimally close to each other as in Figure 8.7, but all other input morphisms and the output
morphism lie apart.
Regard a stack of co-identities on a zigzag path Lused in r. We show that Lis oriented clockwise
with D(r). Recall from Convention 6.10 that co-identities lie in angles with puncture to the right of the
zigzag curve in its natural orientation. The claim now follows from inspection of Figure 8.6c, 8.6d, 8.6b,
8.7. In all cases, our convention implies that the zigzag curve is oriented clockwise with the subdisk.
Lemma C.2. Subdisks of ID result components are ID disks: D(Result ID)⊆Disk ID.
Proof. First, a subdisk of Figure 8.10a or 8.10b has degenerate C input and first and final zigzag paths
are oriented towards the interior of the disk. This makes an ID disk.
Second, a subdisk of Figure 8.10c has degenerate B input. Let us inspect the situation at the con-
cluding arc of the all-in disk involved. Assume α3is the first angle of the disk. Then the degenerate
input directly succeeds the output mark and no further input follows at infinitesimally small distance.
The final angle of the disk can impossibly be α3orα4due to orientation of the concluding arc, therefore
no input precedes the output at infinitesimally small distance. We see that the first, equivalently final
zigzag path L1=LN+1is oriented counterclockwise with the subdisk. We conclude that the subdisk is
an ID disk. A similar conclusion holds in case α4is the final angle.
Before we tackle DS and DW result components, let us recall the nasty results hq(α(D)). Denote by
Sαthe sequence of arcs running from the source or target of αto the source or target of α0, whichever are
closer, without hitting a0. The codifferential hq(α) is then equal to the signed sum of these arc identities:
hq(α) =X
c∈Sαidc.
We are now ready to deal with DS result components.
Lemma C.3. Subdisks of DS result components are DS disks: D(Result DS)⊆Disk DS.
Proof. LetTbe one of the 8 trees in Figure 8.11 and ra result component. We need to check that its
subdisk falls under the condition of DS disks. Indeed, it is bounded by two arcs aandband lies between
a zigzag curve ˜Land its Hamiltonian deformation ˜L′. We only need to check two borderline conditions:
The first condition is that a̸=a0if˜Lis oriented towards the co-identity. The second condition is that
the strip has positive width if ˜Lis oriented away from the co-identity.
Assume ris a result component with a=a0. We will show by inspection that Sαruns away from a0
in oppposite direction of the orientation of ˜L. For this, consider the two cases that the inner product is
µ2(α3,id(C)) or µ2(id(C) , α4) and distinguish further regarding arrow directions. The following graphics
depicts all four cases, with the horizontal zigzag path being L:

In all four cases, we conclude that the arc sequence Sαruns away from a0against the orientation of
˜L. This means that ˜Lis oriented from btoa, in other words: away from the co-identity. This proves the
first condition. The second condition is checked similarly.
Lemma C.4. Subdisks of DW result components are DW disks: D(Result DW)⊆Disk DW.
Proof. This is similar to Lemma C.3. Let us elaborate nevertheless: By definition, DW disks are a
collection of three similar types of disks with α0output. By definition, DW result components are the
α0result components of the 7 trees in Figure 8.12. It is our task to check for every of these 7 trees that
their subdisks fall under one of the three types of DW disks.
Of the 7 trees, the two trees without α0input fall under the triangle DW disk type. The two trees
with an α0input at the beginning fall under the 4-gon DW disk type with α0succeeding the output
mark. The two trees with an α0at the end, as well as the tree with the infinitesimally small subdisk, fall
under the 4-gon DW type with α0preceding the output mark. The additional conditions are checked in
the same way as for DS result components. This case distinction finishes the proof.
C.3 Narrow locations
In this section, we begin proving Lemma 9.23 which states that all CR, ID, DS and DW disks lie in the
image of D. Let us recall the situation: In section C.2 we have already shown that Dmaps only to CR,
ID, DS and DW disks. Starting in the present section and ending in section C.7, we show that every CR,
ID, DS and DW disk is actually reached by D.
Our strategy is to construct an explicit inverse map: In the present section, we analyze the shape of
a given CR disk D∈Disk CR. In section C.4, we build a candidate tree T(D). In section C.5, we build a
result component R(D) ofT(D). In section C.6, we verify that its subdisk D(R(D)) is equal to Dagain.
We will finish our line of proof in section C.7 by applying similar arguments to ID disks and checking the
cases of DS and DW disks combinatorially. The essential data structures for the course of these sections
are collected in Figure C.1.
Here is the observation that drives our strategy: Imagine ris a result component of a π-tree with
subdisk D=D(r). The subdisk catalog orders us to draw the subdisk stroke around all inputs of the
µ≥3disk and end up near its first/final arc, on both sides of the stroke. The subdisk becomes narrow
there! The reader finds examples in Figure 9.6.
Conversely, assume a CR disk Dis given without further knowledge. In order to guess a tree T,
we simply need to record all the narrow locations of DWe are ready for a precise definition of narrow
locations. The reader may already have a glance at Figure C.2, where all upcoming notions are depicted.
Definition C.5. LetDbe a CR disk. Index the angles that the boundary of Dcuts, in clockwise order.
Anarrow location ofDconsists of two indices m > l on the boundary such that:
•Both mandllie in angles whose centers (which are punctures) lie on the inside of the disk.
•Letpmbe the path connecting mto its puncture and plthe path connecting lto its puncture. Both
lift to paths ˜ pmand ˜plin the unit disk model. Then require that ˜ pmand ˜plactually meet.

Figure C.2: Illustrations of narrow locations and their terminology
In particular both punctures are equal. This is the connecting puncture . The union of ˜ pmand ˜plis the
connector of (l, m). Identify two narrow locations if they only differ by rotation around the respective
punctures (which are co-identities or situation C morphisms around these punctures). A narrow location
(l, m) istrivial iflandmonly differ by rotation around their connecting puncture. A narrow location
(l, m) isindecomposable if it is nontrivial and there does not exist an index l < n < m such that both
(l, n) and ( n, m) are nontrivial narrow locations. Two narrow locations ( l, m) and ( l′, m′) are disjoint
ifl′≥morl≥m′(up to rotation around the connecting punctures). A decomposition of a narrow
location ( l, m) into indecomposables consists of indecomposable disjoint narrow locations whose union is
(l, m).
Lemma C.6. LetDbe a CR disk. Then any two indecomposable narrow locations ( l, m) and ( l′, m′)
are either nested or disjoint. Any narrow location decomposes uniquely into indecomposables.
Proof. To prove the first claim, assume ( l, m) and ( l′, m′) are neither nested nor disjoint. Without loss
of generality, we have l < l′< m < m′. Looking at the unit disk model, the connector of ( l′, m′) then
has to pass through the lift of the connecting puncture of ( l, m). In particular the lifts of the connecting
112punctures of ( l, m) and ( l′, m′) are actually equal. Moreover, since the paths ˜ pl, ˜pl′, ˜pm, ˜pm′now all meet,
we have that all of ( l, l′), (l′, m), (m, m′) are actually narrow locations, contradicting indecomposability.
For the second claim, existence of a decomposition is clear (one keeps decomposing until the compo-
nents are indecomposable). Uniqueness follows from the first claim.
C.4 Narrow trees
In this section, we introduce narrow trees. The idea is to capture all narrow locations of a given CR disk
in a structured way. Since we have already seen that narrow locations are nested or disjoint, the most
natural structure to capture them is a tree.
Definition C.7. LetDbe a CR disk with boundary of length |D|. Then its narrow tree is the ordered
decorated tree defined as follows:
•The nodes are all indecomposable narrow locations.
•The nodes are connected according to inclusion.
•The nodes are ordered horizontally from high ( l, m) to low ( l, m).
•The nodes are decorated with their narrow location ( l, m).
•Except in the case where (1 ,|D|) is a narrow location, insert a root standing for the artificial narrow
location (1 ,|D|). The root’s children are the maximal indecomposable narrow locations.
An schematic example of a disk and its narrow tree is shown in Figure C.2i. In this example, the root
is named R. Note that the decorations ( l, m) have been ignored in the narrow tree. In fact, it is not even
possible to given concrete numbers for the decorations ( l, m)∈N×N, since we have only drawn the disk
schematically.
Definition C.8. LetDbe a CR disk and ( l, m) a narrow location (other than the artificial narrow
location). Note that ( l, m) contains multiple identified pairs ( l′, m′). The connector of minimal l′and
maximal m′is the upper connector and the connector of maximal l′and minimal m′thelower
connector .
Letabove (l, m) refer to the portion of Dminus the disk bounded by the upper connector and
the corresponding Dboundary segment, within (l, m) refer to the portion of Dbetween upper and
lower connector, and below (l, m) refer to the portion of Dbounded by the lower connector and the
corresponding Dboundary segment. The segment of the boundary of Dwithin ( l, m) splits into two
components, which are the left-within andright-within the narrow location. The upper boundary
of (l, m) consists of the two situation A arcs just above ( l, m) and the lower boundary of (l, m) consists
of the two situation A arcs just below ( l, m).
Now let ( l, m) be an indecomposable narrow location of an immersed disk D. The stray morphisms
are the input morphisms that are below ( l, m), but above all of its children. A (direct) left (resp. right)
sibling consists of a sibling ( l′, m′) of ( l, m) in the narrow tree such that l′=mup to rotation around
the connecting puncture (resp. m′=l). A (direct) sibling is a direct left or right sibling.
Astack in (l, m) is one of the following: (a) a combination of a stray morphism α3+α4directly
followed by an α0within the next angle being cut, or (b) the combination of multiple α0and id (C)
differing only by rotation around a puncture, or (c) a child together with all siblings and their within
morphisms, or (d) any stray morphism that is not part of one of these combinations. The narrow location
is2-rich if it has at least two stacks. It is 1-rich if it has precisely one stack, and if this stack contains
a child then it has a morphism within or a sibling. The narrow location is 0-rich if it has precisely one
stack, and this stack is a child without morphisms within and without direct sibling.
Remark C.9. Due to zigzag consistency, any narrow location has at least one child or at least one stray
morphism. This means that an indecomposable narrow location ( l, m) is either 2-rich, 1-rich or 0-rich.
C.5 Subresults
In this section, we build a result component from any given CR disk. More precisely, we associate to
every CR disk Daπ-tree T(D) with a result component R(D), in the hope that D(R(D)) equals Dagain.
We will call T(D) the subtree and R(D) the subresult associated with D.
The strategy of constructing T(D) is to take the narrow tree as a starting point and keep inserting
hqµ2nodes to bind together morphisms that lie directly next to each other. We also have to put special
attention to the relation of narrow locations: Siblings have to inserted in a specific order, sometimes
irregularly.
113Let us start from regarding a narrow location ( l, m). Whenever ( l, m) has a left direct sibling or a
morphism left-within, we can easily make a final-out µ≥3disk of ( l, m), whose final morphism stems from
the direct sibling and the further morphisms left-within ( l, m). Indeed, ( l, m) has at least one child or a
stray morphism, therefore this really yields a µ≥2
Tw Gtl qQ.
However in case ( l, m) has no left direct sibling and no morphism left-within, we have to distinguish
whether ( l, m) is 2-rich, 1-rich or 0-rich. In the 2-rich case, we can proceed with an ordinary µ≥3and
obtain a main result component. In the 1-rich case, we can proceed with µ2and obtain a first-order tail
result component. In the 0-rich case, we interpret ( l, m) as a tail node of the first 1-rich or 2-rich narrow
location we arrive at when tracing the tree from ( l, m) towards the leaves.
This is our basic recipe of turning narrow locations into trees. Let us record a lemma affirming that
this construction works.
Lemma C.10. LetDbe a CR disk and let ( l, m) be either:
•an indecomposable narrow location. Then let Ebe the sequence of zigzag segments below ( l, m)
and above all children, together with the lower boundary of ( l, m) and the upper boundary of all
children.
•the root (1 ,|D|) of the narrow tree of D, and assume it is of type id (C). Then let Edenote the
sequence of zigzag segments starting at the output mark, staying above the children of (1 ,|D|), and
ending at the output mark, including the 2/5 arc at the output mark.
•the root (1 ,|D|) of the narrow tree of D, and assume it is of type α3+α4. Then let Edenote the
sequence of zigzag segments starting at the output mark, staying above the children of (1 ,|D|), and
ending at the output mark, excluding the 2/5 arc at the output mark.
Then Ebounds a discrete immersed disk. Upon reversing Figure 9.5 and the stack figures thereafter,
the sequence of stacks injects into the sequence of interior boundary angles of E. The complement of the
image consists of δinsertions and the β(A) morphisms at the children.
In exception to this assignment, a stack directly after or before a child (or the output mark in case 1)
shall map to the entire corresponding β(A) morphism in F, not only the β(A) morphism surrounding
the left or right part. This means that if there is both a stack directly after and a stack directly before
the output mark (or the output mark in case 1), they map in particular to the same β(A), in exception
to injectivity.
Proof. Note that all Dboundary segments involved can be split into small pieces cutting through inde-
composable angles. We shall now construct the discrete immersed disk Fas follows. At each of these
angles whose puncture lies outside D, flow Eoutwards to the puncture.
At each of the angles whose puncture lies inside D, flow Einwards to the puncture. At all angles
whose puncture lies outside D, this procedure enlarges the disk and in particular keeps it immersed. If
Fbecomes non-immersed as discrete disk, then this is due to two angles whose punctures lie inside D
and meet. In other words, loss of immersedness constitutes a narrow location ( l′, m′) ofD.
Let us check the possible locations of ( l′, m′). Note that ( l′, m′) cannot equal (1 ,|D|). Indeed, in case
(1,|D|) is a narrow location at all, it is nontrivial by assumption, its lower boundary consists of merely
two arcs and it does not pose an obstruction to immersedness at all. Similarly, deduce that ( l′, m′) is not
a trivial narrow location.
Since Fcuts all children away and children are indecomposable, any child is either contained in ( l′, m′)
or disjoint. Splitting ( l′, m′) into indecomposable narrow locations then necessarily yields a chain of direct
siblings, which are children of ( l, m). By construction of F, such a chain of direct siblings children does
not constitute an obstruction to immersedness at all.
The second part of the statement consists of generically checking whether any two consecutive stacks
occurring along the boundary of Dmay fall into the same interior boundary angle. For all subdisks in
Figure 9.2, this is definitely not the case. We shall therefore check that Figure 9.2 actually displays all
possible consecutive input stacks. We will illustrate this in case of an α3+α4input, whose 2/5 arc is
oriented counterclockwise with the disk, and an arbitrary successor and predecessor.
Since Dhas convex corners, it cuts the two angles α2andα3before respectively after α3+α4. By
arrow directions, possible α0inputs may occur both on α2andα3. Since we assumed the co-identity
rule, there is at most one α0on both angles. By construction, we assign to the combination of α3and
possibly one α0the corresponding α3interior boundary morphism. Regardless of its precise nature, the
predecessor stack will definitely not map to α3at the same time.
It remains to check the the successor stack. If the successor lies directly at the target of α3, then due
to arrow direction that morphism produces the next α3type interior boundary angle indeed lying one
114arc apart. If the successor lies farther apart, it does not neighbor with α3anymore and will not yield this
as interior boundary angle, which is also in line with injectivity. The three combinations that do occur
are those in Figures 9.2l, 9.2m, 9.2o.
We are now ready for the complete definition of subresults.
Definition C.11. LetDbe a CR disk. Then its subresult is the result component R(D)∈Result πon
thesubtree T(D) constructed below.
Basic structure of T(D) and R(D):
Inductively for every node in the narrow tree of D, we construct a corresponding h-tree (and finally
π-tree) and explain how it shall be inserted into T(D). We refer to any h-tree being constructed
during this process as a subtree . We select inductively for every node of T(D) a single result com-
ponent. This gives a final result component R(D) ofT(D). The construction of T(D) is intended to
inverse the process of taking the subdisk of result components. One can keep an eye on this during
the construction of T(D).
Non-root 0-rich nodes ( l, m) without left direct sibling and without morphisms left-within:
Interpret the narrow location ( l, m) as tail node. Trace the tree down to the first narrow location
that is 1-rich or 2-rich. Then this narrow location produces a β(A) tail result component. Use this
as result component of the subtree. An example is depicted in Figure C.3a.
Non-root 1-rich nodes ( l, m) without left direct sibling and without morphisms left-within:
Now ( l, m) has precisely one stack, and it is either a stack of α4andα0, or of multiple α0and id
(C), or a combination of at least two direct siblings or within morphisms, or just a single stray
morphism. In all cases, binding the stack together yields the desired first-order β(A) first-order
tail result component. Note that in the case of a single stray morphism, the β(A) is actually
an additive component of the deformed cohomology input element, and constitutes a leaf node of
T(D). An example is depicted in Figure C.3b.
Non-root nodes ( l, m), 2-rich or with a left direct sibling or a morphism left-within:
Bind all stacks of ( l, m) together. They will serve as inputs for a final-out disk hqµ≥3. Now let
us prepare the final-out morphism. In case ( l, m) has a left direct sibling, the final-out morphism
is the β(A) output of the left direct sibling. If there are morphisms left-within but no left direct
sibling, bind them together in a β(A) or β/β′(C) tree and use this as final-out morphism. If there
are no left direct siblings and no left-within morphisms, then use a simple δinsertion as as final-out
morphism. Note that we have ensured that in terms of Tw Gtl q, this node is really µ≥2
Tw Gtl qand
notµ1
Tw Gtl q. After making the hqµ≥3disk, compose it afterwards with any id (C) or α0morphisms
that may lie right-within ( l, m). An example is depicted in Figure C.3c.
The α3+α4case. If the output is of type α3+α4, then (1 ,|D|) itself is a narrow location. We will
treat the case where (1 ,|D|) is trivial first and the non-trivial cases afterwards.
Output of type α3+α4with (1 ,|D|) being a trivial narrow location:
If (1,|D|) is a trivial narrow location, then Drevolves around a single puncture, with only id (C)
andα0inputs. The corresponding π-tree is found by composing from left to right.
Output of type α3+α4with 2/5 arc pointing away from D, with (1 ,|D|) having a right-within morphism:
Due to arrow direction, there does not lie an α0input in the very first angle cut by D, after the
output mark. This means the very first input of Dis an id (C) just one cut angle after the output
mark. Build the subtree of (1 ,|D|) as if it were a non-root node, only putting finally φπqµ2instead
ofhqµ2. The final µ2is a product of β(A) and id (C). Since the 2/5 arc points away from D, this
µ2has a α4component and its φπqµ2has the desired α3+α4main result component. An example
is depicted in Figure C.3d.
Output of type α3+α4with 2/5 arc pointing away from D, with (1 ,|D|) without right-within morphisms,
but decomposable or with a left-within morphism:
Build the subtree of (1 ,|D|) as if it were a non-root node, only putting finally φπqµ≥3instead of
hqµ≥3. Let us check that this indeed yields a α3+α4result component. Indeed, the final evaluation
115µ≥3yields α4andφπqµ≥3has the desired α3+α4main result component. An example is depicted
in Figure C.3e.
Output of type α3+α4with 2/5 arc pointing away from D, with (1 ,|D|) without morphisms within,
indecomposable and 0-rich:
Interpret the narrow location ( l, m) as tail node, do not insert a node into T, and continue with
the child.
Output of type α3+α4with 2/5 arc pointing away from D, with (1 ,|D|) without morphisms within,
indecomposable and 1-rich:
Then take the subtree of (1 ,|D|) as if it were not the root node, but put φπqµ2instead of hqµ2and
φπqµ≥3instead of hqµ≥3as root. As established in the multiplication and disk tables, this indeed
yields an α3+α4tail result component.
Output of type α3+α4with 2/5 arc pointing towards D, with (1 ,|D|) having a morphism left-within:
Note that in the final angle being cut before the output mark, there can not lie an α0input be-
cause of the arc direction. Build the subtree of (1 ,|D|) now as if (1 ,|D|) were not the root node,
excluding the final id (C) for the moment. This subtree has a β(A) result component that is in
fact an indecomposable angle. Finally, compose the remaining id (C) with this β(A) and obtain
α3+α4as main result component.
Output of type α3+α4with 2/5 arc pointing towards D, with (1 ,|D|) without morphism left-within,
but decomposable or with morphism right-within:
Decompose (1 ,|D|) into indecomposables C1, . . . , C k(note k≥1). First combine C2, . . . , C kfrom
left to right, together with their morphisms within and the morphisms right-within C1. By as-
sumption there are direct siblings to be combined or there is at least one morphism right-within
Ck. This yields a β(A) or β/β′(C) result component. Now use this as first-out morphism to
bind a φπqµ≥3disk of C1. This disk yields a result µ≥3=α2and hence a main result component
φπqµ≥3=α3+α4. An example is depicted in Figure C.3f.
Output of type α3+α4with 2/5 arc pointing towards D, with (1 ,|D|) indecomposable without morphisms
within and 0-rich:
Then α3+α4actually appears as tail result component of a φπqµ2orφπqµ≥3further downwards.
Output of type α3+α4with 2/5 arc pointing towards D, with (1 ,|D|) indecomposable without morphisms
within and 1-rich:
By zigzag consistency, the stack of (1 ,|D|) cannot consist of a single morphism and also not of the
combination of α4andα0. Therefore binding this stack together yields a final µ2component equal
toβα(A),β′α2orβα3. Now its φπqµ2has the desired α3+α4first-order tail result component.
Output of type α3+α4with 2/5 arc pointing towards D, with (1 ,|D|) indecomposable without morphisms
within and 2-rich:
Then make a φπqµ≥3first-out disk of (1 ,|D|) with a δ-insertion as first morphism. Note that due
to the 2-richness this is µ2
Tw Gtl qorµ≥3
Tw Gtl qand not µ1
Tw Gtl q.
The id(C) case. If the output is of type id (C), then (1 ,|D|) is not a narrow location itself. Building
the disk is a little easier.
Output of type id (C), with (1 ,|D|) 0-rich:
Then trace the tree from (1 ,|D|) towards the leaves. Pick the subtree of the first narrow location
that is 1-rich or 2-rich. Note it has a β(A) main result component. Changing its root from hqµ≥3
toφπqµ≥3or from hqµ2toφπqµ2then yields the desired id (C) tail result component.
Output of type id (C), with (1 ,|D|) 1-rich:
In case of a single child with morphism within, it has a subtree with hqµ2main result component
β(A) associated. The corresponding φπqµ2version has the desired id (C) first-order tail result
component. In case of a stack, this stack cannot consist of a single stray morphism, since this
would contradict zigzag consistency. Instead, it must be a stack of α4andα0or multiple α0and id
116(C). Such a stack comes with a subtree hqµ2and main result component β(A) or β/β′(C). Upon
replacing hqµ2byφπqµ2, we obtain the desired id (C) main result component.
Output of type id (C), with (1 ,|D|) 2-rich:
We now have at least one of the following: two children, one child and one stray morphism, or no
child and two stray morphisms. Pick the subtrees of all children, binding direct siblings and mor-
phisms within together as usual. Bind all stacks of stray morphisms together. Finally, tie everything
into a µ≥3disk.
The id(D) case.
Output of type id (D), with (1 ,|D|) 0-rich:
Trace the tree downwards to the leaves. Pick the subtree of the first narrow location that is 1-rich
or 2-rich. Note it has a β(A) main result component. Changing its root from hqµ≥3toφπqµ≥3or
from hqµ2toφπqµ2then yields the desired id (D) tail result component.
Output of type id (D), with (1 ,|D|) 1-rich:
Then (1 ,|D|) contains a single stack, and this stack is not a single child without morphisms within.
This means the stack produces a β(A) or β/β′(C) main result component and the corresponding
φπqµ2orφπqµ≥3version includes the desired id (D) first-order tail result component.
Output of type id (D), with (1 ,|D|) 2-rich:
Bind together all stacks in (1 ,|D|) and finally take φπqµ≥3. This is possible due to Lemma C.10.
C.6 Verifying the inverse
In this section, we verify that Dmaps CR result components bijectively to CR disks. Believe it or not,
we have defined R(D) in such a way that its subdisk is Dagain. This already shows that Dreaches all
CR disks. Proving injectivity of DonResult CRis harder and requires further constructions.
Lemma C.12. Assigning subresults provides a map R:Disk CR→Result π. We have D◦R= Id|DiskCR.
Proof. This follows inductively from the construction of R(D).
The above lemma already shows that Dreaches all CR disks. Prove injectivity of DonResult CRis
harder. It requires us to show how to reconstruct the basic structure of rfrom D(r). By basic structure,
we mean a very specific notion: the evaluation tree.
Definition C.13. Letrbe a result component of a Kadeishvili π-tree ( T, h 1, . . . , h N). Then its evalu-
ation tree is the decorated ordered tree defined as follows:
•There is a node for every tail result component of type hqµ2orφπqµ2and every result component
of type hqµ≥3orφπqµ≥3used in r.
•For every node, insert as many subsequent nodes above as the used tail part is long.
•Connect the nodes according to the tree structure of T.
•Order the nodes horizontally according to their horizontal appearance in T.
•Regarding decoration of a node X, note that Xdetermines a result component of a subtree on
its own and comes with a β(A) morphism. This determines a narrow location of D(r) and is the
decoration of X.
Lemma C.14. Letrbe a result component of a π-tree. Then the narrow tree of D(r) is equal to the
evaluation tree of r.
Proof. All nodes in the evaluation tree of rstand for taking immersed disks and yielding β(A) morphisms
and hence determine narrow locations. The nodes of the evaluation tree are also connected according to
inclusion. Now let us show by induction on the height that this inclusion of the evaluation tree in the
narrow tree is actually surjective. Let Nbe a node in the narrow tree all of whose children appear in the
evaluation tree. We will show that then also Nappears in the evaluation tree. In fact, rneeds to bind all
children C1, . . . , C ktogether in some immersed disk. This determines a node Min the evaluation tree,
and also a narrow location M. But now the children are nested in both MandN, which means one of

impossibly be an immersed disk since a version shorter on both sides already bounds a disk. Therefore
M=Nas narrow locations and since Mappears in the evaluation tree, we have that Nappears in the
evaluation tree, which was to be shown. Finally given the equal structure of the trees, their decorations
are also equal.
Equipped with this characterization, we are ready to prove Dinjective on Result CR.
Lemma C.15. The map D:Result CR→Disk CRis injective, and hence D:Result CR∼− →Disk CR.
Proof. Letr1, r2∈Result CRdenote two π-trees together with result components whose subdisks D(r1)
andD(r2) are equal. By Lemma C.14, the evaluation trees of r1andr2are then equal. This means that
these trees differ only by the order in which stacks are bound and the order in which the nodes of the
evaluation trees are linked together and bound together with morphisms within. It is readily checked
using the disk and multiplication schemes of Table 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 that there is only a unique way to
bind these combinations.
For example, a stack of α4andα0can only be bound in one way, the choice of result component is
clear from the next higher node in the evaluation tree. A stack of α0and id (C) morphisms can only be
bound in one way. A stack of direct siblings and α0and id (C) morphisms can also be bound only in one
way. Essentially, all steps in the construction of T(D) are the unique way to obtain a result component.
In other words, there is only one way to compose a result component whose evaluation tree equals the
narrow tree of D(r1) =D(r2). We conclude that r1=r2.
C.7 The case of ID, DS and DW disks
In this section, we verify that Dsends ID, DS and DW result components bijectively to ID, DS and DW
disks. For ID disks, we sketch inverse constructions similar to the CR case. For DS and DW disks, the
statement reduces to combinatorics.
Let us first dedicate ourselves to ID result components.
Lemma C.16. The map D:Result ID→Disk SLis injective and its image is precisely Disk ID.
Proof. Injectivity is similar to the case of CR result components. We now show that all ID disks are
reached by D. Let Dbe an ID disk. We provide a preimage through explicit construction. In all cases it
can be checked that its subdisk is Dagain. We shall distinguish the “regular” inputs from the degenerate
ones.
First, assume the degenerate input is of C type. Then the procedure is similar to the CR case. We
construct a result component of Figure 8.10a or 8.10b. Let us apply the formalism of result components
toD. Regard the narrow location (1 ,|D|) itself.
If (1,|D|) is trivial, then evaluate from left to right all identities except the degenerate input and the
final regular one. Then compose with the final regular id (C) and note that this precisely produces an id
(B) result component of Figure 8.10a or 8.10b. Note that Dmay have stacked α0inputs directly after
the output mark. They are welcome in our construction: They are composed one after another with the
ultimate β(A).
If (1,|D|) is nontrivial, decompose it into narrow locations C1, . . . , C k. As in the CR case, generally
from left to right. In particular, if there is no regular identity left-within C1, then evaluate C2, . . . , C k
first and use their result for a first-out disk of C1. If there is however a regular identity left-within C1,
then evaluate C1, . . . , C kentirely from left to right. In both cases this yields hq(α2) = id (B). Finally
compose with the degenerate id (C) and obtain the desired id (C) result component. Again, note that
stacked α0inputs directly after the output mark are welcome, and that the orientation of the 2/5 arc at
the degenerate id (C) is relevant.
Second, assume the degenerate input is of B type. We construct an all-in disk as in Figure 8.10c.
Denote by Lthe source and target zigzag path of D. Denote by a0its identity arc. The degenerate B
input just before the output mark dictates that Lturns right at a0.
IfLis oriented clockwise with D, then the B input preceding the output identity gives rise to an
α4. As in Lemma C.10, the stacks of Dinject into the boundary angles of an all-in disk. The tree
corresponding to Dis obtained by binding all stacks into trees, and then evaluating their all-in disk with
µ≥3= id (D) and hence φπqµ≥3= id (D).
IfLis oriented counterclockwise with D, then the B input succeeding the output identity gives rise
to an α3. Again, an all-in disk yields the desired id (D) result component.
119Next are DS result components. Since both DS result components and DS disks are defined by
combinatorics, this reduces to simple checks.
Proposition C.17. The map D:Result DS→Disk SLis injective and its image is precisely Disk DS.
Proof. Let a DS disk of Land ( a, b) be given. We recapitulate how to reconstruct its result component.
Depending on whether Lturns right or left at a, let the first factor of the inner multiplication be
the corresponding id (C) or α3+α4. Correspondingly the second factor will be α3/α4or id (C). This
indeed produces an id (B) result component, since blies in the arc sequence Sαstarting at a. Similarly
depending on whether Lturns right or left at b, let the other factor of the outer multiplication be the
corresponding id (C) or α3/α4.
Now if the two inputs at acome first in D, insert the inner multiplication on the right side of the
tree. If acomes last, insert the inner multiplication on the left side of the tree.
Finally, note that amay equal a0. The α(D) angle involved lies on the opposite side of where Lgoes.
Therefore if Slies in the same direction as L, then the angle lies on the opposite side and its hqinvolves
the identity on i, hence a=breally yields a result component. If Slies in the opposite direction of where
Lgoes, then the angle lies on the side of Sand the possible set of bindices does not include a.
Lemma C.18. The map D:Result DW→Disk SLis injective and its image is precisely Disk DW.
Proof. This is similar to the DS case. The reader may find the Lemma C.4 and its proof helpful.
C.8 Signs and q-parameters
In this section, we prove Lemma 9.25, which claims that the sign of a result component is precisely
the Abouzaid sign of its subdisk. Our strategy is to start from direct inputs and work our way up. In
particular, we first compute signs of result components of h-trees. This approach requires that we define
Abouzaid signs also for subdisks of h-trees. Note we treat signs additively everywhere.
Definition C.19. LetDbe a subdisk of a result component of an h-tree or π-tree. Then its Abouzaid
sign Abou( D)∈Z/2Zis the sum of all # signs around D, plus the number of odd inputs hi:Li→Li+1
where Li+1is oriented counterclockwise with D, plus one if it concerns a π-tree and its output t:L1→
LN+1is odd and LN+1is oriented counterclockwise. In case ris aβ(A) result component, the long
version of the subdisk shall be taken.
Recall that a result component of an h- or π-tree is not only a morphism r∈Hom HLq(L1, LN+1), but
also remembers how it was derived from the tree. In particular, the value of any result component of an
h-tree or π-tree does not carry any scalars, except signs. It is of the form
±Qεresp. ±Qt, (C.1)
where ±is a sign, Q=q1. . . q k∈CJQ0Kis a pure product of punctures, ε:L1→LN+1is an elementary
morphism resp. tis a cohomology basis element of L. Note (C.1) means we measure the sign relative to
the natural signs of the cohomology basis elements.
Let us now show that any result component comes precisely with the Abouzaid sign. For a result
component rof aπ-tree or h-tree, we denote by S(r) the Abouzaid sign of the subdisk of r. We proceed
by induction.
Signs of direct inputs
Proposition C.20. Letrbe a direct result component of an h-tree or π-tree that has a subdisk associ-
ated. Then the sign of ras in (C.1) equals the Abouzaid sign of the subdisk of r.
Proof. The sign is indeed correct for direct inputs. A co-identity α0(D) comes sign # α0+ 1. Its subdisk
is by definition on the α0side (instead of the α′
0side) and by Convention 6.10 the zigzag paths runs
counterclockwise, which makes the Abouzaid sign of the co-identity also equal to # α0+ 1. A direct α3
input comes with sign # α3+ 1. Its subdisk consists of an input on the 2/5 arc and cutting the α3angle,
which means the Abouzaid sign is also # α3+ 1. Similarly, a direct α4comes with sign # α4, a direct β
(C) comes with sign # α3+ #α4+SD, a direct β′(C) with sign # α1+ #α2+SD, a direct α′
0with sign
#α0. Finally, a direct β(A) as tail component of an α3+α4input comes with sign # α3+ 1 + SDif it
is from the α3part of (7.3) (and hence Li+1is counterclockwise) and with sign # α4+SDif it is from
theα4part of (7.3) (and hence Li+1is clockwise). A direct β(A) as tail component of an id (C) input
comes with sign # α1+ #α2+SDif it is from the β′part of (7.4) and with sign # α3+ #α2+SDif it
is from the βpart of (7.4). All these signs are equal to the Abouzaid signs.

Table C.4: Signs of most result components of h-trees
Signs of h-trees
Next, let us check the signs for result components of h-trees.
Lemma C.21. Letrbe a result component of an h-tree or π-tree that has a subdisk associated. Then
the sign of ras in (C.1) equals the Abouzaid sign of the subdisk of r.
Proof. The signs are collected in Table C.4. This table informs about the applicable hqrule, the sum of
the input signs, the sum of signs due to µapplications, the sum of signs due to hqapplications and the
total Kadeishvili sign. Note that by induction assumption, the inputs already have the correct Abouzaid
sign.
In those rows of Table C.4 that concern a disk result component, the m1, . . . , m krefer to the inner
angles of the disk. That is, the disk is supposed to be µk≥3(mk, . . . , m 1). Some mimay be δinsertions.
Their S(mi) shall stand for zero. For β(A) result components, SDshall stand for zero if it concerns a
main result component, while equal to the sum of the hash signs around the tail if it concerns a tail result
component. For the α′
0,β/β′(C) result components, Nα0denotes the number of α0inputs in the result
component (including the α′
0used). A single time the notation ˜βwas used to distinguish two different β
(A) result components.
Let us examine the example of an β(A) result component of hqµ2(α0, α4) in detail. Both inputs α0
andα4are necessarily direct. The morphism α0comes with sign # α0+ 1 and α4comes with sign # α4.
This gives a total input sign of # α0+ 1 + # α4. We have µ2(α0, α4) =−α3α4, which gives a sign of 1

This gives a sign of # α4+ 1 + SDdue to application of hq. A Kadeishvili sign of 1 is added. The total
sign the β(A) tail result component is now
#α0+ 1 + # α4+ 1 + # α4+ 1 + SD+ 1≡#α0+SD.
Let us compare with the Abouzaid sign S(β). This sign consists of all # signs around the tail, including
#α0, plus two because both odd inputs α0andα3+α4are counterclockwise. This is precisely the same.
Note Table C.4 does not treat explicitly the β(A) result component of Figure 8.7. This result
component is however a combination of β/β′(C) or β(A) and α0and id (C) compositions on the right,
which are already present in Table C.4.
Signs of π-trees
Lemma C.22. Letrbe a direct result component of a π-tree that has a subdisk associated. Then the
sign of ras in (C.1) equals the Abouzaid sign of the subdisk of r.
Proof. The most signs of π-trees are checked in Table C.5. Let us treat the others manually.
Let us check the case where α3+α4is the G tail result component of some φπq(βα). We could
theoretically check this by going through all the cases. It is easier to rely on what we already have.
Namely −hq(βα) has an associated main result component β, which comes out of hqµ≥2with the correct
signS(β). This means the µ≥2must have had sign S(β) + # α+ 1 + 1 in front of βα. Then its α3+α4
G tail result component comes with an additional sign of SD+ #α+ 1 in case of G1 and SD+ #αin
case of G2. In total, we get a sign of S(β) +SD+ 1 in case of a G1 tail result component and S(β) +SD
in case of a G2 result component, precisely the Abouzaid sign.
Let us check the case where id (C) is the H tail result component of some φπq(βα). Then −hq(βα)
has an associated result component β, which comes out of hqµ≥2with the correct sign S(β). This means
theµ≥2must have had sign S(β) + # α+ 1 + 1 in front of βα. Then its id (C) H tail result component
comes with an additional sign of SD+ #α. In total, we get a sign of S(β) +SD, precisely the Abouzaid
sign.

Table C.6: Signs of id (D) result components of Figure 8.10.
Checks for the id (D) result components of Figure 8.10 are contained in Table C.6. For example, regard
the case the id (B) comes from a first-out disk µk≥3(mk, . . . , m 1). According to Figure 8.2, the outside part
ofm1isα2and hence odd. We get µk≥3(mk, . . . , m 1) =−α2and evaluation of hq(α2) gives another sign
of (−1)#α2. Together with the Kadeishvili sign we obtain that id (D) has sign S(mk)+. . .+S(m1)+# α2
as result component, precisely the Abouzaid sign.
Finally, let us check the α3+α4and id (C) result components of the 8 trees of Figure 8.11. Recall
such a result component a degenerate strip on a zigzag path Las subdisk.
Let us investigate the inner product first. In case of µ2(α3,id(C)) resp. µ2(id(C) , α4), the inner
product has sign # α3+ 1 resp. # α4+ 1. Regard the infinitesimally short stem of the strip between
the two factors of the inner product. If the angle α3resp. α4as morphism L→Lfalls under case 1 of
Figure 6.7, then hqadds a sign of # α3+ 1 resp. # α4+ 1. Together with the Kadeishvili sign, the inner
product has a total sign of 1. Indeed, the stem is counterclockwise in this case. If α3resp. α4falls under
case 2, then hqadds a sign of # α3resp. # α4. Together with the Kadeishvili sign, the inner product has
a total sign of 0. Indeed, the stem is clockwise in this case.
Let us now investigate the outer product. Regard the infinitesimally short stem at the output mark.
When id (C) or α3+α4comes at the end of the strip, φπqµadds no sign (in case of α3+α4, the
intrinsic sign # α4stays correctly until the end). In case α3+α4comes at the end of the strip, this
indeed constitutes an odd intersection and an odd output and both add the same sign since both refer
to the orientation of the stem. In case id (C) comes at the end of the strip, this indeed produces an even
intersection and an even output mark.
When id (C) comes at the beginning of the strip, φπqµgets no sign. Indeed, the output is then also
even. When α3+α4comes at the beginning of the strip, then φπqµgets a single extra sign. The output is
then also α3+α4and their claimed signs refer to the orientation of Land of its Hamiltonian deformation
L′. Since both point in the same direction, but lie on opposite sides of the strip, they contribute to the
Abouzaid sign with 1.
123D The case of punctured spheres
In this section, we redo our entire minimal model computation in the case of specific punctured spheres.
In particular, our treatise includes the 3-punctured sphere, also known as pair of pants. The simplest
yet instructive example of mirror symmetry for punctured surfaces, it would be a shame not to know
the minimal model of its deformed zigzag category. However, no dimer on a sphere is consistent and
Theorem 9.26 therefore fails to apply. This is the reason we redo the entire calculation in the case of
specific sphere dimers with M≥3 punctures.
In contrast to the case of geometrically consistent dimers, the simplified Kadeishvili construction of
section 2.3 does not apply. For this reason, we need to resort to the general deformed Kadeishvili theorem
from [18]. We shall not attempt to review the general construction here, and only offer the following
minimalistic explanation: First, there is no direct sum decomposition which deserves the name of “de-
formed splitting”. Instead, the construction builds a deformed decomposition with lesser properties.
Second, the construction iteratively uncurves the category until it has optimal curvature . Third, the
structure on the minimal model is described in terms of Kadeishvili trees. We refer to [18] for details.
As we conclude in Proposition D.18 and D.22, the minimal model H Lqcan be described explicitly
by means of CR, ID, DS and DW disks. This description also accurately captures the curvature und
residual differential on H Lq. Explicitly, for odd Mand specific choice of spin structure the category H Lq
is curvature-free and has a residual differential. For even Mthe category H Lqhas curvature and residual
differential.
In section D.1, we give an overview of what goes wrong for non-consistent dimers. In section D.2,
we focus on specific sphere dimers QMwith an odd number of punctures M≥3. We choose a specific
type of spin structure, tailored to the use in mirror symmetry. In section D.3, we choose a homological
splitting. In section D.4, we describe the deformed zigzag category Lq. In section D.5, we compute the
deformed decomposition of Lq. In section D.6, we introduce the suitable notion of result components. In
section D.7, we assemble the minimal model H Lq. In section D.8, we comment on the case of QMfor
even M.
D.1 Absence of consistency
In this section, we list consequences of the lack of geometric consistency. Within section 6 until 9, we have
used geometric consistency heavily. Is geometric consistency actually a necessity? To find an answer,
we collect the most important statements which we proved using consistency. For every statement, we
explain how it depends on consistency and whether it can be partially recovered when dropping the
consistency assumption.
Zigzag segments do not bound disks. We proved this statement directly using geometric consis-
tency. Upon dropping geometric consistency, zigzag segments can easily bound disks.
Deformed zigzag paths are uncurvable. We proved this by explicit uncurving, which succeeds be-
cause zigzag segments do not bound disks. When zigzag segments bound disks, two issues can
occur: If the zigzag segment ends in an A situation, we need to adapt the uncurving procedure,
but it provides no hindrance to uncurving. If the zigzag curve actually bounds a teardrop, then the
zigzag path can inherently not be uncurved.
A, B, C, D situations exhaust all angles. This statement mainly uses that every puncture has at
least 4 arc incidences. In fact, a non-consistent dimer may have punctures with only 2 arc incidences.
This gives rise to new types similar to B and C situations, with the difference that the head or tail
of the shared arc 2 = 5 may have 2 arc incidences. More practically, this would push β(C) or β′
(C) to be empty angles.
Lqsatisfies µ1
Lq(H)⊆µ1
Lq(CJQ0Kb⊗R).IfQis so nonconsistent that Lqhas inherent curvature, then this
statement is already not applicable any more. Namely, µ1
Lqdoes not square to zero anymore and we
cannot invoke the simplified Kadeishvili theorem of section 2.3. If Qis only so nonconsistent that
Lqcan be uncurved (albeit by an adapted procedure), then the inclusion typically does not hold.
Nevertheless, the deformed Kadeishvili theorem applies and yields a minimal model with residue
differential. It is clear that the description of Hqwill be very complicated.
E, F, G, H disks as classification of tail terms. The shape of the terms in µ≥3
q(δ, . . . , ε, . . . , δ ) is
analyzed by zooming in at the concluding puncture. In distinguishing E, F, G, H disks, we have
used that the concluding puncture has at least 4 arc incidences. When dropping consistency, the
resulting terms need not be of A, B, C, D type, but also of the variants explained above.

Situation B/C cohomology basis elements have only type E tail. This is proved directly using
geometric consistency: An intersection between L1andL2renders it impossible to find type F,
G, H disks when tracing L1andL2away from the intersection. Upon dropping consistency, B/C
cohomology basis elements acquire tail also from F, G, H disks. This raises additional complexity:
The G and H disks will contribute result components, forcing us into capturing them.
Every narrow locations has at least one below morphism. A narrow location without below mor-
phism constitutes a zigzag segment bounding a disk. Upon dropping consistency, imagine a segment
of a zigzag path Lthat bounds a disk. According to our explanations above, the δ-matrix should
already be adapted to facilitate uncurving. In fact, the new δ-matrix of Lwill have a situation A
morphism for every disk bounded by one of its segments and more situation A morphisms inserted
on its tail. These situation A morphisms compensate for the lack of below morphisms. This modifi-
cation allows us to construct result components for a given CR/ID disk Deven if a narrow location
(l, m) ofDhas no below morphism.
The calculation for the sphere dimers QMbasically proceeds as in the geometrically consistent case.
Based on the above list of issues, we can however point out a few differences: In the consistent case, Lq
is always uncurvable. In the sphere case, for odd Mand specific choice of spin structure it is uncurvable,
for even Mit is not uncurvable. In the consistent case, minimal models constructed by our deformed
Kadeishvili construction are based on a deformed cohomology space Hqsatisfying µ1
Lq(Hq) = 0. In the
sphere case, we only achieve µ1
Lq(Hq)⊆Hq. In the consistent case, the deformed counterpart φ−1(h) of
h= id (C) morphisms includes tails of β/β′(C). In the sphere case, the deformed counterpart φ−1(h) of
h= id (C) morphisms includes no tails, but a single nearby id (B) morphism.
D.2 The sphere and its zigzag category
In this section, we define specific sphere dimers and define their category of zigzag paths. The dimers
we pick are those also used as A-side for commutative mirror symmetry in [3]. The dual dimers of these
spheres are consistent and therefore suited for noncommutative mirror symmetry of [9].
The dimer we regard is the sphere dimer QMforM≥3 depicted in Figure D.1a. This dimer has M
punctures and Marcs. It has two polygons, namely the clockwise front side and the counterclockwise
rear side. We shall briefly discuss the differences between the cases of odd and even M, and then focus
on the odd case. In order to apply our findings to deformed mirror symmetry later on, we shall define
one specific spin structure.
The zigzag curves of this sphere dimer QMare described as follows: In case Mis odd, there is precisely
one zigzag curve. It cycles around the arcs once, and then cycles around the arcs again with opposite δ
angles. In case Mis even, there are precisely two zigzag curves, each of them cycling around the arcs
once. The smooth zigzag curves in both cases are depicted in Figure D.1c. In the picture, the arc system
has been pulled to the front side of the sphere so that the zigzag curves become clearly visible.
Let us now focus on the case of odd M≥3 and fix spin structure as follows.
Convention D.1. The letter Q=QMstands for the sphere dimer with M≥3 odd. The spin structure
of the zigzag path is chosen by assigning # α= 1 to an odd number of interior angles on the rear side of

In Definition D.2, we define the category of zigzag paths L⊆Tw Gtl QMas in the case of geometrically
consistent dimers. In the case Q=QM, the only object in the category is the single zigzag path L.
Definition D.2. Thecategory of zigzag paths L⊆Tw Gtl QMis the full subcategory consisting of
the single zigzag path.
We intend to write down the explicit twisted complex for L. The main issue consists of numbering
all indexed arcs of Land the angles between them. In fact, a zigzag path consists of indexed arcs, as
opposed to purely arcs of QM. We shall therefore denote the arcs in sequence by a1, . . . , a 2M, with the
convention that h(a1) =qMandt(a1) =q1andLturns right at the head of a1.
The indexed small angles of Lshall be denoted by α1, . . . , α 2M, such that α1:a1→a2andα2:a3→
a2and so on. In other words, αiruns at the head of aiifiodd and at the tail of aiifiis even. In other
words, we have α2i:a2i+1→a2iandα2i+1:α2i+1→α2i+2. These angles are depicted in Figure D.2a.
We count all indices modulo 2 M. In contrast, an index shift of Mtypically turns a situation from
left to right and from right to left. For example, we have αi+M̸=αi. Compare Figure D.2a and D.2b.
We also have ai=ai+Mas arcs of QM, but not as indexed arcs of L.
Fori= 1, . . . , 2M, we denote the complementary angle to αibyα′
i. For instance if iis odd, then αi
runs from ai+1toai. We denote the arc identity of aiby id i, and the arc identity ai→ai+Mby id′
i.
We set βi:= id′
jαiandβ′
i:= id′
jα′
i, where jis chosen so that the composition makes sense. We are now
ready to define the deformed category of zigzag paths:
Generically denoting a full turn by ℓ, these angles together with their multiples with ℓpowers form a
basis of the hom space Hom L(L, L). Examples of these angles are depicted in Figure D.2c.
D.3 Homological splitting
In this section, we provide a homological splitting for Lin case of odd M≥3. We first explain the analogy
of all basis morphisms with the consistent case. Then, we write down an explicit choice of cohomology
basis elements and an explicit choice of R. We explain why it constitutes a homological splitting.
We have seen that End L(L, L) has a basis given by basis morphisms of the kind id i, id′
i,αi,α′
i,βi
andβ′
i. Let us compare with the consistent case. The angle id iis an arc identity. In terms of A, B, C,
D situations, we denoted it as id (D). The angle id′
iis comparable to an id (C) morphism for odd i, and
comparable to an id (B) morphism for even i. The angle αiis simply α(D), and similarly α′
iisα′(D).
There are ambiguities of interpreting βiandβ′
iin terms of A, B, C, D situations. A possible choice is
matching βiwith α4(B) for odd iand with α1(B) for even i, and matching β′
iwith α3(B) for odd iand
with α2(B) for even i. In short, the two differences are that we have explicit indices iinstead of using
A, B, C, D situations as enumeration tools and that we have less morphisms overall since ever puncture
has only 2 arc incidences.
We now define a candidate splitting H⊕I⊕R, modeled after the consistent case:

In Table D.3 we have checked that every morphism in End L(L, L) can be written in terms of H,I
andR. The table also serves as a convenient reference for the definition of HandR. In analogy to the
consistent case, the sum H+I+Ris in fact direct. Let us record this as follows:
Lemma D.4. The spaces H,I= Im( µ1
L) and Rprovide a homological splitting for L.
D.4 Deformed category of zigzag paths
In this section, we define the category Lqof deformed zigzag paths. As in the consistent case, its
definition is based on the complementary angle trick. In contrast to the consistent case, we must expect
that uncurving fails. Due to our specific spin structure, curvature cancels nevertheless.
Definition D.5. Regard a sphere dimer Q=QMwith odd M≥3. Let # denote a choice of spin
structure as in Definition D.2. Then the deformed category of zigzag paths is category Lq⊆

We now come to our first meaningful calculation in the sphere case: the curvature of Lq. We expect
curvature in principle, since Lis contractible when regarded in the closed surface |Q|. With our specific
spin structure, the curvature contributions from front and rear side however cancel each other.
Lemma D.6. The curvature of Lvanishes, we have µ0
Lq= 0.
Proof. We have to evaluate µ0
Add Gtl qQ+µ2
Add Gtl qQ(δ, δ) +µ≥3
Add Gtl qQ(δ, . . . , δ ). As in the geometrically
consistent case, the first two terms cancel each other. In contrast, the term µM(δ, . . . , δ ) yields two
individual contribution for each index i= 1, . . . , 2M, one from the front and one from the rear side:

structure.
D.5 Deformed decomposition
In this section, we provide the deformed decomposition for Lq. More precisely, the category Lqis
curvature-free but does not satisfy µ1
q(Bb⊗H)⊆µ1
q(Bb⊗R). The deformed Kadeishvili theorem from [18]
nevertheless applies and defines a deformed decomposition Hq⊕µ1
q(Bb⊗R)⊕(Bb⊗R) with µ1
q(Hq)⊆Hq.
In this section, we compute Hqexplicitly, together with a few values of the deformed codifferential.
128As a preparation, we perform here a few calculations of µ1

k−M+1.
We have used that ##( k+ 1) = ## k+ #( k+M)−#k.
In order to apply the deformed Kadeishvili theorem, we need to compute the space Hqalong the
procedure of Definition 2.28. In other words, we shall calculate the deformed counterparts h−Ehof the
cohomology basis elements h∈H. By abuse of notation, let us write # α0for the # sign associated with
α0andqα0for the puncture around which α0winds.
Lemma D.8. The deformed cohomology basis elements are given by
(−1)#(i+M)+1β′

Proof. We need to check two things: First, all added infinitesimal terms lie in CJQ0Kb⊗R. Second, the
map µ1
Lqsends all the deformed basis elements to Hq.
The first step is an easy observation: Indeed id′
i−1for odd iandα′
0lie in R. For the second part, we
need to evaluate µ1
qon the deformed cohomology basis elements and check that the result belongs to Hq.
We execute all calculations in order:
First, we regard the morphism ( −1)#(i+M)+1β′

= (−1)##(i+1)+1Qi+2idL∈Hq.
We have used that ##( k+M) + ##( k) is the total number of # signs in the dimer, which is odd by
assumption.
Second, we regard the morphism id′
i+ (−1)#(i−1)+#( i+M−1)qi−1id′
i−1for odd i. We compute
µ1
Lq(id′
i+ (−1)#(i−1)+#( i+M−1)qi−1id′

Third, we regard the identity id L=P
iidiand compute
µ1
q(idL) =µ2(idL, δ) +µ2(δ,idL) = 0 .
Fourth, we deal with the co-identity ( −1)#α0+1α0+(−1)#α0qα0α′
0. Let ibe the index where α0is located,
such that αi=α0. Note that iis even, since α0is supposed to lie on the counterclockwise side of QM.
130In evaluating µ1on the deformed co-identity, there appear two types of terms: four µ2terms and many
µMterms. The µ2terms cancel each other as in the case for consistent dimers:
µ2((−1)#α0+1α0,(−1)#α0qα0α′
0) +µ2((−1)#α0qα0α′
0,(−1)#α0α0)

We are now ready to calculate the µMterms:

We have used Remark D.7 and ##( i+ 1)≡##(i−M+ 1) + 1 ∈Z/2Z. These calculations show that
the claimed elements are indeed the deformed cohomology basis elements, which finishes the proof.
The deformed Kadeishvili theorem lays out the following procedure: We have already uncurved the
category Lqsuccessfully. We have the full space Hqin our hands. Next we have to compute the deformed
codifferential hq: Hom Lq(L, L)→Bb⊗R. After that, we will be able to evaluate Kadeishvili trees and
derive the minimal model.
It is not necessary to compute the entire codifferential hq. Instead, the most important cohomology
basis morphisms are of the form βi+β′
iandα0+qα′
0and id′
i+qid′
i−1. Any product µ≥3
qof these can
only produce an identity. Any product µ2
qof these can only produce βiα′
iorβ′
iαiorα0α′
0orα′
0α0orβi
orβ′
iorαiorα′
i. It suffices to calculate the codifferential of these morphisms.
Let us analyze all the easy cases before we calculate the harder ones: For those morphisms lying in
R, the codifferential immediately vanishes. Moreover, for odd ithe element βi+β′
ilies in Hqandβ′
ilies
inR, thus hq(βi) = 0 for odd i. The nontrivial cases are as follows:
131Lemma D.9. We have the following values of the codifferential:
hq(αi) =±idaj+. . .±idaiforαi̸=α0,
hq(β′
i) = (−1)#(i+M)id′
ifor even i,
hq(β′
iαi) = (−1)#i+1β′
ifor odd i,
hq(β′
iαi) = (−1)#(i+M)+1βifor even i,
hq(α0α′
0) = (−1)#i+1α′
0.
Proof. The first two cases are simple: The value of µ1
qon identities equals the value of µ1and therefore
decomposition of αiandβ′
ifrom Table D.3 remains valid. We remark that for αithe right-hand side
needs to be written as α0+qα′
0−qα′
0, but since α′
0∈Rthis is no issue.
The third case consists of checking β′
iαifor odd i:
µ1
q(β′
i) = (−1)#i+1β′
iαi+ (−1)#(i+M)+1qiβiα′
iℓk+µM(. . .).
The term βiα′
ilies in R. The terms resulting from µM(. . .) are all of the form id i. The hqof such terms
necessarily vanishes, and we deduce the above codifferential equation.
The fourth case of β′
iαifor even iis similar. Finally, we check the fifth case of α0α′
0:
µ1
q(α′
0) = (−1)#i+1[(α0α′
0) + (α′
0α0)] +µM(. . .).
The terms resulting from µM(. . .) are all of the form id′
i. These either lie directly in Ror they lie in H
when combined with additional id′
i−1∈R.
In Lemma D.9, we have saved ourselves from computing the describing the correct signs of hq(αi). In
fact, the signs are analogous to those presented in section 6.3.
D.6 Result components
In this section, we analyze result components of H Lqand match them with CR, ID, DS and DW disks.
The starting point is the category Lq. In section D.5 we have already computed the deformed cohomology
basis elements and the deformed codifferential. Here, we regard Kadeishvili trees, analyze the shape of
their outputs and introduce a suitable notion of result components. We introduce a suitable notion of
CR, ID, DS and DW disks and match all result components with smooth disks of these four types.
As in the classical case, we start by computing a multiplication table for important endomorphisms
ofL∈Lq. The multiplication table is found in Table D.4.
Remark D.10. Most values in Table D.4 are checked easily using Table D.3 and more specifically
Lemma D.9. They can be grouped essentially in three types: those multiplications which always yield a
particular value (with respect to µ2,hqµ2andπqµ2), those which vanish if iis even or odd and yield a
nonzero value if iis odd respectively even, and those which involve α0where only close inspection proves
them to vanish. The products µ2(α0,id′
i) and µ2(id′
i, α0) notably fall in the latter category. Let us digest
this in case of µ2(α0,id′
i): From the fact that α0lies in the counterclockwise polygon, we deduce that the
source arc of α0is odd and therefore iis even. The result µ2(α0,id′
i) then equals β′
i−1. Now i−1 is odd,
the element β′
i−1lies in Rand we conclude hq(β′
i−1) =πq(β′
i−1) = 0. This explains the entry of m2=α0
andm1= id′
iin Table D.4.
Remark D.11. As in the case of consistent dimers, the multiplication table merely indicates possible
products, as opposed to products that actually exist. For example, the three indices “ i” in a product rule
likeβi=µ2(idi, βi) are not meant to denote the same index, but rather indicate the type of morphism:
The first is an indexed βmorphism, the second an indexed arc identity and the third again an indexed
βmorphism. The table merely implies that any actually existing product is of the form βi=µ2(idj, βk)
for some combination of indices ( i, j, k ) allowed. Of course, we can check which combinations actually
yield nonvanishing results: Those are precisely βi=µ2(idi+M+1, βi) for odd iandβi=µ2(idi+M, βi) for
even i. We will refer to precise combinations of indices ( i, j, k ) that yield nonvanishing results as precise
shape of the product. We may also refer to precise shapes when referring to hqorπqevaluations like
βi+β′
i=πqµ2(idi, βi). In any case, the precise shape is understood to link all indices involved.
Definition D.12. Kadeishvili h-trees, π-trees and their result components are defined as in the consistent
case. In particular, a tree is supposed to have at least two leaves. The grouping rule for result components
specifically reads as follows: The π-tree result components ( −1)#(i+M)+1β′
iand (−1)#iβishall be grouped
together as one result component. Also, the result components id ishall be grouped together as one result
component.

Table D.4: Multiplication table. Whenever the parity of iis specified, this refers to the parity of the
index of the µ2result, instead of the indices of the inputs or hqandπqvalues.
We now analyze which result components are possible. As in the consistent case, we can assume
that the inputs of a Kadeishvili tree do not include the identity element id L=P2M
i=1idi. We analyze all
possible result components of h-trees first, before proceeding to π-trees. Their inputs may be deformed
basis elements of type α0+qα′
0,βi+β′
iand id′
i.
A Kadeishvili h-tree is decorated by hqµLqon all its non-leaf nodes. A Kadeishvili π-tree is decorated
byhqµLqon all its non-leaf non-root nodes, and πqµLqon the root. Our notation µ2
qorµ≥3
qrefers to the
products of Add Gtl qQ.
As a first clue towards our analysis, we claim that µ≥3
qcan only be applied at the root. Indeed a disk
µ≥3
qcan only yield id iand id′
i. In both cases, their hq-values vanish. Their πq-values are given by
πq(idi) =(
idLifi=i0
0 elseand πq(id′
i) =(

0 else.
This shows that µ≥3
qcan only be applied at the root. The decoration at all other nodes necessarily
concerns a µ2
q.
Lemma D.13. Any result component α0orβiof an h-tree is direct. Any result components β′
i,α′
i, id′
i,
idiofh-trees are derived from one of the trees in Figure D.6, D.7, D.9, D.10.
Proof. We start with explaining the first statement, and then delve into the second one. Our first
observation is that α0does not appear in the multiplication table D.4 at all and therefore any result
component α0is necessarily direct. Regard now a result component βiand assume it is non-direct.
According to the multiplication table, it must be derived from a product of the form µ2(β′
i, α0). Let
us investigate the precise shape of this product: As α0is located on the rear side, the index iof the
morphism β′
iis necessarily even. Therefore β′
icannot be direct, while a glance at the multiplication table
simultaneously reveals that β′
iwith even icannot be produced as a non-direct result component either.
We conclude that no single result component can be derived from a product µ2(β′
i, α0). Finally, this
means that any result component βiis direct. This proves the first desired statement.

Regard now a result component β′
iand assume it is non-direct. We have already seen that iis
necessarily odd and β′
iis derived from a product of the form µ2(α0, βi). The precise shape of this product
isµ2(α0, βi) with ibeing equal to the index of the co-identity angle α0incremented by M. Finally, we
also realize that both α0andβiare direct. The tree is depicted in Figure D.6.
Regard a result component α′
iand assume it is non-direct. According to the multiplication table, it is
derived from µ2(β′
i, β′
i) orµ2(α0, α′
i). Let us examine both cases separately. In the first case, the precise
shape of the product is µ2(β′
i+M, β′
i). In particular either iori+Mis even, while there are in fact no
result component β′
iwith even i. The first case is therefore impossible. In the second case, the precise
shape is µ2(α0, α′
0). We recall that α0is necessarily direct, and α′
0may either be direct or be derived
from a product µ2(α0, α′
0) again. This gives a recursion on how α′
0is derived. Solving this recursion gives
the tree in Figure D.7.
Regard a result component id′
iand assume it is non-direct. According to the multiplication table, it
is derived from µ2(idi, β′
i) orµ2(β′
i,idi) orµ2(id′
i, α′
i). Let us examine all three cases. In the first and
second case, β′
ineeds even index in order to have nonvanishing hq. However, we have already seen that
result components β′
iall have odd index. This means there is no result component derived from the first
or second case. In the third case, the precise shape of the product is id′
i=hqµ2(id′
i+1, α′
i) and iis even.
We conclude that id′
i+1is direct. Even better, the result component α′
iis necessarily α′
0and is derived
from one of the trees in Figure D.7. This gives rise to the tree in Figure D.9.
Regard a result component id i. It is necessarily non-direct, since we excluded the identity cohomology
elements from the tree inputs. According to the multiplication table, it is derived from µ2(id′
i, βi) or
µ2(β′
i,id′
i). Let us explore both cases. In the first case, the precise shape is id j=hqµ2(id′
i+M+1, βi) and
iis odd. Note that jis free, and in fact hqµ2(id′
i+M+1, βi) produces many arc identities at once. Finally,
due to parity both id′
i+M+1andβiare necessarily direct. This yields one tree. In the second case, the
precise shape is αi=µ2(β′
i+M,id′
i+1) with even i. We already know that id′
i+1is necessarily direct. In
contrast, β′
i+Mmay be either direct or derived from µ2(α0, βi+M). The latter case however entails that
αi=α0, hence µ2(β′
i+M,id′
i+1) =α0andhqµ2(β′
i+M,id′
i+1) = 0. We conclude that β′
i+Mis necessarily
direct instead. This yields one single tree. In total, both trees producing id iresult components are
depicted in Figure D.10.
We are now ready to approach result components of π-trees.

Lemma D.14. Allπqµ2result components id′
i,β′
i+βi, idi,α0are derived from one of the trees in
Figure D.11, D.12, D.13, D.14.
Proof. The idea is to systematically read off from the multiplication table D.4 all possible ways these
result components may be be derived from result components of h-trees. All result components of h-
trees falls under the regime of Lemma D.13, allowing us to make statements on how they are derived
themselves. In each case, we acquire full knowledge of the entire π-tree.
Regard an id′
iresult component of a π-tree. According to the multiplication table D.4, it is necessarily
derived from µ2(idi,id′
i) orµ2(id′
i,idi). In the first case, the precise shape is id′
i=πqµ2(idi+M,id′
i) with
iodd. We realize that id′
iis necessarily direct, while id i+Mmay come from two possible trees. In the
second case, the precise shape is id′
i=πqµ2(id′
i,idi) with iodd. We realize that id′
iis direct, while id i
may again come from two possible trees. In total, the four possible trees are depicted in Figure D.11.
Regard an β′
i+βiresult component. According to the multiplication table, it is derived from µ2(idi, βi)
orµ2(idi, β′
i) or µ2(id′
i, α′
0) or µ2(βi,idi) or µ2(β′
i,idi) or µ2(α′
0,id′
i). Let us investigate all these six
cases. In the first case, the precise shape is β′
i+βi=πqµ2(idi+M+1, βi) with iodd. We realize that
βiis direct and id i+M+1may come from two possible trees. In the second case, the precise shape is
β′
i−1+βi−1=πqµ2(idi+M, β′
i) with ieven. Since no result component β′
iwith even iexists, this case
is impossible. In the third case, the precise shape is β′
i−1+βi−1=πqµ2(id′
i+1, α′
0) with ieven. We
realize that id′
i+1is direct and α′
0comes from the known standard type of tree. In the fourth case, the
precise shape is β′
i+βi=πqµ2(βi,idi) with iodd. We realize that βiis direct and id imay come from
two possible trees. In the fifth case, the precise shape is β′
i−1+βi−1=πqµ2(β′
i,idi) with ieven. Since
no result component β′
iwith odd iexists, this case is impossible. In the sixth case, the precise shape is
β′
i+M+βi+M=πqµ2(α′
0,id′
i+M) with i=h(α0) even. We realize that id′
i+Mis direct and α′
0comes from
the known tree. In total, all six trees are depicted in Figure D.12.
Regard an id iresult component. According to the multiplication table, it is derived from µ2(idi,idi)
orµ2(id′
i,id′
i). In the first case, the precise shape is id i0=πqµ2(idi0,idi0). Since the arc identity id i0
never appears as result component of an h-tree, this case is however vacuous. In the second case, the
precise shape is id i0=πqµ2(id′
i0+M,id′
i0). This tree is depicted in Figure D.13.
Regard an α0result component. According to the multiplication table, it is derived from µ2(idi, α0)
orµ2(α0,idi) orµ2(id′
i, βi) orµ2(β′
i,id′
i). Let us investigate all four cases. In the first case, the precise
shape is α0=πqµ2(idi, α0) with i=h(α0) even. We realize that α0is direct, while id imay come from
two possible trees. In the second case, the precise shape is α0=πqµ2(α0,idi+1) with i=h(α0) even.
We realize that α0is direct, while id i+1may come from two possible trees. In the third case, the precise
shape is α0=πqµ2(id′
i+M, βi) with ieven or α0=πqµ2(id′
i+M+1, βi) with iodd. The former case is
impossible, since there is no result component βiwith ieven. In the latter case, both id′
i+M+1andβi
are direct. In the fourth case, the precise shape is α0=πqµ2(β′
i+M,id′
i+1) with ieven. We realize that
id′
i+1is direct, while β′
i+Mmay be direct or derived from µ2(α0, βi+M). We recall that in the latter case
it is necessary that i=h(α0). The total collection of seven trees is depicted in Figure D.14.
We now introduce the suitable version of CR, ID, DS and DW disks.
Definition D.15. CR, ID, DS and DW disks are defined as in the case of geometrically consistent
dimers. More specifically, the definitions read as follows: A CR disk is an SL disk where all inputs and
the output lie apart, with the exception that stacks of α0inputs are allowed if the SL disk lies on the

denoted Disk CR,Disk ID,Disk DSandDisk DWrespectively.
Subdisks of result components of π-trees are defined in the same way as in the consistent case. A
few peculiarities of the subdisk construction are depicted in Figure D.15 and Figure D.16. As in the
consistent case, associating subdisks provides a bijection between result components and CR, ID, DS and
DW disks. Since a π-tree has at least two inputs by definition, the subdisk mapping only reaches CR,
ID, DS and DW disks which have at least two inputs as well. We denote these classes of CR, ID, DS and

a result component rwhose drawing D(r) isD. We will not prove this in detail. In fact, the cases to be
studied are merely a subset of the cases of the case of consistent dimers.
D.7 Minimal model
In this section we provide our minimal model for Lq. The assembly works as follows: In section D.6, we
have already enumerated all result components for the products µ≥2
HLqin terms of CR, ID, DS and DW
disks. In section D.5, we have computed the differential µ1
Lqon the deformed cohomology basis elements.
In the present section, we assemble the minimal model H Lq. In particular, we show that not only the
higher products µ≥2
HLqare computed by CR, ID, DS and DW disks, but also the differential µ1
HLq. We
offer an explicit list of the CR, ID, DS and DW disks that contribute to the differential.
In Proposition D.18, we claim that the differential µ1
HLqis enumerated accurately by CR, ID, DS and
DW disks. It makes sense to compile a list of these disks in advance. Recall that the an SL disk with a
single input is a digon: a smooth immersed disks with two corners. In what follows, we try to spot and
list all digons of which the input is a given morphism h. We can already ignore DS and DW disks, since
they have at least two inputs. The following is our sphere digon list:
138Digons for the odd morphism h=β′
i+βi:There is precisely one single digon with input h. It is a
CR or ID disk and its output is id L. This type of digon is depicted in Figure D.17a.
In general, one spots this digon as follows: The intersection point hcuts the zigzag curve ˜Linto
two segments. One segment departs towards the front side at hand the other depars towards the
rear side. The identity id Llies by choice on one of these two segments. Whether it lies on the front-
or rear-bound segment determines the location of the claimed digon. Specifically, the digon lies on
the front side if departing at htowards the front we hit the identity id Lbefore returning to h, and
on the rear side if departing at htowards the rear side we hit the identity id Lbefore returning to
h.
Digons for the even morphism h= id′
i:There are precisely two digons with input id′
i. Both are CR
disks with output type β′
i+βi. They simply reach around the punctures neighboring the input id′
i.
They are depicted in Figure D.17b.
Digons for the co-identity h=α0:We spot Mdigons contributing to µ1((−1)#α0+1α0), namely ( M−
1)/2 on the front side and ( M+1)/2 on the rear side. These digons are all CR disks and have output
of type id′
i. In case of M= 5, these digons are all heart-shaped and depicted in Figure D.17c.
In general, one spots these digons as follows: Of the M-many self-intersection point p∈L∩L, fix
an arbitrary one. We shall construct from this data one certain digon that has corners handp.
For this, note that pcuts the zigzag curve ˜Linto two segments. Only one of these two segments
contains the co-identity location α0. The digon associated with pis then the digon bounded by this
segment. In other words, if the segment containing α0departs to the front side at h, then the digon
lies on the front side. If the segment containing α0departs to the rear side at h, then the digon lies
on the rear side. This determines a digon contributing to µ1(h) for every of the self-intersection
points p∈L∩L.
Before we reach the main theorem, we shall comment on the signs of result components. Recall that
the Abouzaid sign of an SL disk is defined in Definition 9.24 and allows an arbitrary nonnegative number
of inputs. The definition of the Abouzaid sign carries over without change to the case of Q=QM. In
analogy to Lemma 9.25, the sign of a result component agrees with the Abouzaid sign of its subdisk:
Lemma D.17. Letrbe the result component of a π-tree. Then the sign of r, relative to the signs of
the output value, equals the Abouzaid sign of its subdisk D(r). The q-parameter ∈CJQ0Kis equal to
Punc( D), the product of all punctures covered by D(r) counted with multiplicities.
In contrast to the consistent case, the category H Lqhas a residual differential. We can in fact describe
the differential by means of CR and ID digons, the sign being equal to the Abouzaid sign. In contrast
to the consistent case, the definition of the Abouzaid sign rule is here also used for digons. We are now
ready to formulate our freshly built interpretation as a description of the minimal model.
Proposition D.18. LetQMbe the standard sphere dimer with an odd number M≥3 of punctures.
Leth1, . . . , h Nbe a sequence of N≥0 non-identity basis morphisms with hi:Li→Li+1. Then their
product is given by
µN
HLq(hN, . . . , h 1) =X
D∈DiskCR˙∪DiskID˙∪DiskDS˙∪DiskDW
Dhas inputs h1,...,h N(−1)Abou( D)Punc( D) t(D).
More explicitly,
•The curvature µ0
HLqvanishes.
•The differential µ1
HLqis given by the digons in the sphere digon list, with Abouzaid sign rule.
•We have ( −1)|h|µ2
HLq(idL, h) =µ2
Lq(h,idL) =handµ3
HLq(. . . ,idL, . . .) = 0.
•Products µ≥2
HLqon all sequences of non-identity inputs are given by the CR, ID, DS and DW disks,
with Abouzaid sign rule.
Proof. The minimal model H Lqis given by the deformed Kadeishvili theorem from [18]. To start with,
recall that we have already computed the deformed cohomology basis elements in Lemma D.8. The
deformed Kadeishvili theorem then provides curvature, differential and products for H Lq. We shall put
focus on checks for the differential, since the structure of the products is very similar to the structure
observed in the geometrically consistent case.
139We have noted in Lemma D.6 that the curvature µ0
Lqalready vanishes. According to our Kadeishvili
theorem the curvature µ0
HLqthen vanishes as well. This already proves the first statement. We check the
three remaining statements in order.
For the second statement, regard the differential µ1
Lq. According to the deformed Kadeishvili theorem,
the differential µ1
HLqis given by the composition of µ1
Lqand the projection to deformed cohomology πHq.
We have computed the differential µ1
Lqalready in Lemma D.8 and observed that µ1
Lq(Hq)⊆Hq.
The projection is therefore without effect and we have µ1
HLq(h) =µ1
Lq(h) for deformed cohomology basis
morphisms h. For example, we have
µ1
HLq((−1)#(i+M)+1β′
i+ (−1)#iβi) = (−1)##(i+1)+1Qi+2idL.
It remains to show that for every deformed cohomology basis element h, its differential µ1
HLq(h) is
enumerated accurately by CR, ID, DS and DW disks. We have listed all CR, ID, DS and DW disks in
the sphere digon list. For any deformed cohomology basis element hof one of the three types βi/β′
i, id′
i
andα0, it remains to interpret the result terms rofµ1
HLq(h) as enumeration over the digons presented
in the sphere digons list. The crucial part is to prove the sign of every term requal to the Abouzaid sign
Abou( D) of the corresponding digon D.
First, regard the odd morphism h=β′
i+βi, with odd i. The calculation of Lemma D.8 gives one
single output term, namely the identity id L. This is exactly the result enumerated by the single digon
Dfrom the sphere digons list. It remains to compare the sign ( −1)##(i+1)+1with the Abouzaid sign
ofD. The sign of Dis computed as follows: In case the digon lies on the front side, the # signs to be
summed up are # i, . . . , #(i−M+ 1). Their sum amounts to ##( i−M+ 1), which has equal parity
with ##( i+ 1) + 1, since the total number of # signs in QMis assumed to be odd. In case the digon
lies on the rear side, the # signs to be summed up are #( i+M), . . . , #(i+ 1). Their sum amounts to
##(i+ 1). An additional sign flip is due, since his odd and lies counterclockwise with respect to the
rear side. Ultimately, both front and rear cases give the sign ##( i+ 1) + 1. This sign agrees with our
calculation of µ1
Lq(h) in Lemma D.8.
Second, regard the even morphism id′
i. There are two digons in our digon list contributing to the dif-
ferential µ1(id′
i), namely the two small digons reaching around the neighboring punctures. The Abouzaid
sign rule predicts a sign of ( −1)#i+#(i+M)for the upper puncture and ( −1)#(i−1)+#( i+M−1)for the lower
puncture, exactly as calculated in Lemma D.8.
Third, regard the co-identity ( −1)#α0+1α0. There are Mdigons in our digon list contributing to the
differential µ1((−1)#α0+1α0), namely ( M−1)/2 on the front side and ( M+ 1)/2 on the rear side. For
the front side disk with output id′
i−j+1, the Abouzaid sign rule predicts a sign of ( −1)##(i−j+1). For the
rear side disk with output id′
i+j+1, the Abouzaid sign rule predicts a sign of ( −1)##(i+j−M+1)+1, the
absolute sign flip ( −1) coming from the odd co-identity whose zigzag path runs counterclockwise with
respect to the rear side.
We conclude that the differential µ1
HLq(h) is computed accurately by the digons from the sphere digons
list for any of the three types of morphisms h. This finishes the checks for the second statement of the
proposition.
The third statement of the proposition is trivial, following immediately from unitality of Lqand the
choice that id L∈H. The fourth statement follows from Lemma D.16 and Lemma D.17, in a way entirely
analogous to the geometrically consistent case. This finishes the proof.
D.8 The case of even M
In this section, we comment on the category of zigzag paths of QMfor even M. We define the category L
of zigzag paths and explain how to obtain a homological splitting. We explain how to run the curvature
optimization for the corresponding subcategory of Tw Gtl qQand define the category of deformed zigzag
paths L. Finally, we provide a minimal model for H Lq.
The dimer QMfor even M≥4 has two zigzag paths, each consisting of Marcs. There are M
intersections between the zigzag curves. The front side of the dimer is a clockwise polygon, the rear side
is a counterclockwise polygon.
Convention D.19. The letter Q=QMwith M≥4 even denotes the standard sphere dimer with M
punctures. The spin structure is chosen by assigning an even number of # signs on the rear side of QM
and none on the front side. The identity locations are arbitrary chosen, and the co-identity location is
chosen to lie on the rear side of QM.
140Definition D.20. The category L⊆Tw Gtl QMis the category consisting of the two zigzag paths in
QM. The standard splitting H⊕I⊕RforLis defined in the analogous way as for odd M. The category
Lq⊆Tw′GtlqQMis the category consisting of the two zigzag paths with deformed twisted differential
analogous to Definition D.5.
A priori, it is our task to compute a minimal model of the category of zigzag paths in Tw Gtl qQ
consisting of the same twisted complexes as L⊆Tw Gtl Q. As usual, we are allowed to apply gauge in
order to optimize the curvature. In contrast to the case of geometrically consistent QorQMfor odd M,
the category Lqis not curvature-free, but its curvature is optimal nevertheless:
Lemma D.21. The curvatures of both zigzag paths L1, L2∈Lqare multiple of their respective identities
idL1∈Hand id L2∈H. In particular, Lqhas optimal curvature.
The deformed decomposition Hq⊕µ1
q(Bb⊗R)⊕(Bb⊗R) ofLqis similar to the case of odd M. The
differential does not vanish and maps to Hq⊕(Bb⊗R). According to the deformed Kadeishvili construction,
we can compute H Lqby setting

HLqis similar to the
case of odd Mas well, with the difference that µ1
HLqdoes not cancel because of the different choices of
# signs. The computation for µ0
HLqis elementary. As in the case of odd M, it turns out that the entire
A∞-structure of the minimal model can be described through CR, ID, DS and DW disks:
Proposition D.22. LetQMbe the standard sphere dimer with an even number M≥4 of punctures.

E Calculating the mirror objects
The aim of this section is to perform further minimal model calculations which we need for the third
paper in the series. Our calculations are based on the general deformed Kadeishvili construction of [18],
because the simplified Kadeishvili construction of section 2.3 does not apply.
In section E.1, we explain which products in the minimal model need to be computed and why. In
section E.2, we describe the input data of the minimal model construction. In section E.3, we construct
a homological splitting. In section E.4, we compute the deformed decomposition. In section E.5, we
introduce a suitable notion of result components and classify them into two types which we call MD and
MT result components. In section E.6, we show how to match MD/MT result components with disks of
two types which we call MD/MT disks. In Proposition E.19 we finally describe the desired products in
terms of MD and MT disks.
E.1 Mirror symmetry for punctured surfaces
In this section, we explain the reason we need to perform further minimal model calculations. The
starting point is a brief recapitulatation of mirror symmetry for punctured surfaces. We then explain the
idea of the deformed Cho-Hong-Lau construction and describe which products we need to compute.
Mirror symmetry for punctured surfaces [9] entails a quasi-isomorphism
F: GtlQ→mf(Jac ˇQ, ℓ).
Here Qis a dimer and ˇQis its mirror dimer which is assumed to be zigzag consistent. The vertices of
ˇQare identified with the zigzag paths in Q. The algebra Jac ˇQis the so-called Jacobi algebra of the
dimer and is explicitly defined as the quiver algebra CˇQmodulo relations. The element ℓ∈JacˇQis
141a central element known as the potential. The category MF( A, ℓ) denotes the dg category of so-called
matrix factorizations of ( A, ℓ). The category mf(Jac ˇQ, ℓ) denotes one a certain small subcategory of
MF(Jac ˇQ, ℓ), specific to mirror symmetry.
The deformed mirror symmetry which we prove in the third paper entails a quasi-isomorphism of
deformed A∞-categories
Fq: Gtl qQ→mf(Jac qˇQ, ℓq).
The category Gtl qQon the left-hand side has an object for every arc a∈Q1. The category on the right-
hand side is what we will call a deformed category of matrix factorizations. It has one object for every
arca∈Q1as well. The functor Fqmatches the arc a∈GtlqQwith an deformed matrix factorization
Fq(a).
In the third paper, we compute the deformed algebra Jac qˇQand deformed potential ℓq. The starting
point is the category of deformed zigzag paths Lq⊆Tw′GtlqQ. Thanks to the description of the
minimal model H Lqwhich we provided in the present paper in section 9.5, we express in the third paper
the deformed algebra Jac qˇQand the deformed potential ℓqexplicitly in terms of combinatorical data of
Q. Viewed the other way around, the present paper is the technical cornerstone for the third paper.
In the third paper, we also compute the precise shape of the deformed matrix factorizations contained
in mf(Jac qˇQ, ℓq). According to the deformed Cho-Hong-Lau construction, the precise shape is given
by certain products in H Tw Gtl qQwhich not only involve zigzag paths, but also the arc objects. The
description of these products is not included in section 9. Therefore, the we have devoted the present
Appendix E to supplementing these products.
The objects of mf(Jac q, ℓq) are explicitly of the form
Fq(a) = M
L∈LHom H Tw Gtl Q(L, a)⊗(Jac qˇQ)vL, δ!
,
δ(m) =X
N≥0µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, b, . . . , b|{z}
N).
Here adenotes any arc in Q, the letter vLdenotes the vertex of CˇQdefined by the zigzag path L, and m
denotes an element of Hom H Tw Gtl Q(L, a). The element bdenotes essentially a formal sum over all type
B cohomology basis elements between zigzag paths in Q. Geometrically, the element bincludes all odd
transversal intersections between zigzag curves.
The essential calculation which we shall therefore perform in the present Appendix E consists of
determining the hom space Hom H Tw Gtl Q(L, a) and computing all possible kinds of products of the form
µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, h N, . . . , h 1). Here hi:Li→Li+1are type B cohomology basis elements between zigzag
paths and m:LN+1→ais a cohomology basis element from LN+1to an arc a∈Q1.
E.2 The desired products
In this section, we examine which minimal model H Tw Gtl qQwe shall compute. In principle, we are
free to choose any minimal model. When computing the mirror Jacobi algebra Jac qQand potential ℓq,
we have however already made a choice for minimal model of Lq⊆Tw Gtl qQ. The minimal model we
compute here needs to be compatible with these earlier choices.
Convention E.1. Qis a geometrically consistent dimer or a standard sphere dimer Q=QMwithM≥3.
The dimer is equipped with choices of spin structure, identity location a0and co-identity location α0for
every zigzag path. In case Q=QMwith Modd, the spin structure is chosen by assigning # α= 1 to an
odd number of interior angles αon the rear side and # α= 0 to all other angles. In case Q=QMwith
Meven, the spin structure is chosen by assigning # α= 1 to an even number of interior angles αon the
rear side and # α= 0 to all other angles. The co-identity α0shall be chosen to lie in a counterclockwise
polygon.
Definition E.2. We denote by L⊆Tw Gtl QandLq⊆Tw′GtlqQthe categories of zigzag paths and
of deformed zigzag paths, defined as follows:
•IfQis geometrically consistent, Lis the category of zigzag paths as defined in section 6.1 and Lq
is the category of deformed zigzag paths as defined in section 7.1.
•IfQ=QMfor odd M≥3, then Lis the category of zigzag paths as defined in section D.2 and Lq
is the category of deformed zigzag paths as defined in section D.4.
142•IfQ=QMfor even M≥3, then Lis the category of zigzag paths as defined in section D.8 and Lq
is the category of deformed zigzag paths as defined in section D.8.
To construct a deformed mirror functor Fq: H Tw Gtl qQ→mf(Jac qˇQ, ℓq), we need a choice of
minimal model of the entire category Tw Gtl qQ. According to our deformed Kadeishvili theorem, we can
obtain such a minimal model by optimizing curvature for all objects and performing a familiar Kadeishvili
tree construction. The input data for this construction consists only of a homological splitting for every
hom space in Tw Gtl Q. All other steps are automatic.
Remark E.3. Our deformed Kadeishvili construction has the property that the restriction of a minimal
model H Cqto a subcategory D ⊆ C is the same as the minimal model H D, when the homological splitting
chosen for Dis the restriction of the homological splitting chosen for C:
HC|ObD= HD.
To construct the restriction of this functor to Gtl qQ, we however do not need to compute the en-
tire minimal model H Tw Gtl qQexplicitly. It suffices to know products of the kind µ(hN, . . . , h 1) and
µ(m, h N, . . . , h 1), where h1, . . . , h Nare morphisms between zigzag paths and mis a morphism from a
zigzag path to an arc. By Remark E.3, it suffices to compute a minimal model of the category Q1∪Lq,
which is defined as the subcategory of Tw′GtlqQconsisting of arcs and deformed zigzag paths. We define
this category precisely as follows:
Definition E.4. The subcategory of Tw Gtl Qgiven by the union of Gtl QandLis denoted
Q1∪L⊆Tw Gtl Q.
The subcategory of Tw Gtl qQgiven by the union of Gtl qQandLqis denoted
Q1∪Lq⊆Tw Gtl qQ.
Remark E.5. Applying the Kadeishvili construction to Q1∪Lqinvolves choosing a homological splitting
forQ1∪L. The deformed mirror symmetry construction in the third paper departs from a single minimal
model model H Tw Gtl qQ. In consequence, it is not allowed to compute the products of the two kinds
µTw Gtl qQ(hN, . . . , h 1) and µTw Gtl qQ(m, h N, . . . , h 1) via different homological splittings of L. Instead,
the homological splitting for Q1∪Lneeds to extend the homological splitting already chosen for L.
E.3 Homological splitting
In this section, we construct a homological splitting for the category Q1∪L. The starting point is
the definition of the category Q1∪Lin section E.2. According to Remark E.5, we have to define the
homlogical splitting for Q1∪Lin the following way:
•For the hom spaces Hom Tw Gtl Q(L1, L2) between two zigzag paths L1, L2, the homological splitting
is the homological splitting already established for L. In case Qis geometrically consistent, this
refers to the homological splitting of section 6.3. In case Q=QMfor odd M≥3, this refers to the
homological splitting of section D.3. In case Q=QMfor even M≥4, this refers to the analog of
section D.3 indicated in section D.7.
•For the hom spaces Hom Tw Gtl Q(L, a) between a zigzag path Land an arc a∈Q1, we are free to
choose a homological splitting.
•For the hom spaces Hom Tw Gtl Q(a, L) between an arc a∈Q1and a zigzag path L, we are free
to choose a homological splitting. In practice, this choice is irrelevant for the calculation of the
products µTw Gtl Q(m, h N, . . . , h 1), so we will merely assume any arbitrary splitting has been chosen.
•For the hom spaces Hom Tw Gtl Q(a, b) between two arcs a, b∈Q1, the homological splitting is
predetermined as H= Hom Tw Gtl Q(a, b) and I=R= 0 by the fact that µ1
GtlQ= 0.
According to this list, the only remaining task is to choose a homological splitting for Hom Tw Gtl Q(L, a)
whenever Lis a zigzag path and aan arc. We start by classifying morphisms L→ainto three types of
situations.
As in the case of L, let an elementary morphism ε:L→arefer to a morphism between twisted
complexes consisting of a single angle of Q. We shall associate with every elementary morphism a
situation . As usual, the terminology is as follows: Every elementary morphism belongs to a unique
situation, and every situation is of one given type. Running out of letters, we will denote the situation
143βα
β′α′
(a) S1 situationβα
β′α′
(b) S2 situationαβ
γ
(c) S3 situation
types by S1, S2, S3. Every situation is defined by a certain collection of arcs and angles. The other
way around, every situation has a collection of elementary morphisms associated, constructed from its
defining angles.
Definition E.6. AnS1situation consists of a zigzag path Land an indexed arc aofLsuch that L
turns left at the head of a. The nearby angles of the situation are denoted α,α′,β,β′as in Figure E.1a.
The elementary morphisms belonging to an S1 situation are the morphisms ε:L→agiven by id L→a,
βℓk,ββ′ℓk,αℓk,αα′ℓk.
AnS2situation consists of a zigzag path Land an indexed arc asuch that Lturns right at the head
ofa. The nearby angles of the situation are denoted α,α′,β,β′as in Figure E.1b. The elementary
morphisms belonging to an S2 situation are the morphisms ε:L→agiven by id L→a,α′ℓk,α′αℓk,β′ℓk,
β′βℓk.
AnS3situation consists of two consecutive indexed arcs on a zigzag path Land an arc asuch that a
is incident at the common puncture of the two arcs but not equal to either of them. The nearby angles
of the situation are denoted α,β,γas in Figure E.1c. The elementary morphisms belonging to an S3
situation are the morphisms ε:L→agiven by βℓk,βαℓk.
We have constructed these definitions so that the situations exhaust all elementary morphisms in
Hom Tw Gtl Q(L, a). We record this as follows:
Lemma E.7. LetLbe a zigzag path and aan arc. Then any elementary angle ε:L→abelongs to
precisely one S1, S2 or S3 situation.
We are now ready to construct our homological splitting for Hom Tw Gtl Q(L, a). This means to provide
a choice of basis elements for HandR.
Definition E.8. LetLbe a zigzag path and aan arc. We let R⊆Hom Tw Gtl Q(L, a) be the subspace
spanned by:
•for every S1 situation the morphisms id L→a,αα′ℓkandββ′ℓk,
•for every S2 situation the morphisms α′ℓkandβ′ℓk,
•for every S3 situation the morphism βℓk.
The space H⊆Hom Tw Gtl Q(L, a) is spanned by:
•for every S1 situation the morphism ( −1)#ββ,
•for every S2 situation the morphism id L→a.
Setting I=µ1
Tw Gtl Q(R), we refer to H, I, R as the (standard) splitting for Hom Tw Gtl Q(L, a).
It is an elementary check that the standard splitting is indeed a homological splitting.
Lemma E.9. Letabe an arc and La zigzag path. Then the standard splitting indeed forms a homological
splitting for Hom Tw Gtl Q(L, a).
E.4 Deformed decomposition
In this section, we determine the relevant part of the deformed decomposition of Q1∪Lq. The starting
point is the category Q1∪Lqdefined in section E.2 and the homological splitting for Q1∪Ldefined in
section E.3. In the present section, we show that Q1∪Lqhas optimal curvature. We determine explicitly
the deformed decomposition of the hom spaces Hom Q1∪Lq(L, a), where L∈Lis a zigzag path and a∈Q1
an arc.
Lemma E.10. The category Q1∪Lqhas optimal curvature.
144Proof. IfQis geometrically consistent, then Lqis curvature-free by Lemma 7.5. If Q=QMwith M
odd, then Lqis curvature-free by Lemma D.6. If Q=QMwith Meven, then Lqhas optimal curvature
by Lemma D.21. The subcategory Q1⊆Q1∪Lqhas optimal curvature by nature, so we conclude that
Q1∪Lqhas optimal curvature.
Since Q1∪Lqalready has optimal curvature, the products µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, h N, . . . , h 1) can be obtained
by computing the deformed decomposition of Hom Q1∪Lq(L, a) and evaluating Kadeishvili π-trees. As next
step, we shall therefore focus on finding the deformed decomposition for Hom Q1∪Lq. More precisely, we
are interested in the deformed cohomology basis elements.
Finding the deformed decomposition entails finding for every cohomology basis element h∈Ha
deformed cohomology basis element φ−1(h) =h+rsuch that r∈Bb⊗Rand
µ1
Tw Gtl q(h+r)∈(Bb⊗H)⊕(Bb⊗R).
For the cohomology basis elements hof the hom space Hom Tw Gtl Q(L, a), we can compute φ−1(h) ex-
plicitly:
Lemma E.11. Leta∈Q1be an arc and La zigzag path. Then the space Hsatisfies
µ1
Tw Gtl qQ(H)⊆(Bb⊗H)⊕(Bb⊗R).
In particular, we have Hq=Bb⊗Hand the map φ:Hq→Bb⊗His the identity.
Proof. Let us start by checking for every cohomology basis element hthatµ1
Tw Gtl qQ(h) lies in ( Bb⊗H)⊕
(Bb⊗R). Let Lbe a zigzag path and aan arc. Denote by q=h(a) the puncture at the head of aand
byp=t(a) the puncture at the tail of a. Denote by δ∈Hom1
Add Gtl qQ(L, L) the twisted differential of
L∈Lq.
Regard an S1 situation between Landa. Denote by β, β′the angles associated with the S1 situation.
We want to compute the differential of the cohomology basis element h= (−1)#ββ. We have
µ1
Tw Gtl qQ(β) =X
k≥0µk+1
Add Gtl qQ(β, δ, . . . , δ )
=pββ′β[±id(S2) ±id(S1) ±β(S3)]
∈(Bb⊗H)⊕(Bb⊗R).
In the first row, we have simply spelt out the definition of µ1
Tw Gtl qQ. In the second row, we have evaluated
all products. The first term pββ′βarises from k= 1. Further terms may arise from k≥2, depending on
the situation. If Qis geometrically consistent, then β(S3) terms may appear, stemming from first-out
discrete immersed disks. If Qis not geometrically consistent, also id (S1) and id (S2) terms can appear.
Either way, we see µ1
Tw Gtl qQ(β) lies in ( Bb⊗H)⊕(Bb⊗R).
Regard an S2 situation between Landa. Denote by α′andβ′the associated angles. Then
µ1
Tw Gtl qQ(idL→a) =−qα′−pβ′∈Bb⊗R.
This proves the claimed inclusion µ1
Tw Gtl qQ(H)⊆Bb⊗R. In the terminology of section 2.3, this means
E= 0 and we conclude
Hq={h−Eh|h∈Bb⊗H}=Bb⊗H.
According to Definition 2.28, the map φ:Hq→Bb⊗His the identity. This finishes the proof.
The deformed decomposition for the hom space Hom Q1∪Lq(L1, L2) between two zigzag paths L1, L2is
simply the deformed decomposition described earlier. In case Qis geometrically consistent, this deformed
decomposition was computed in Proposition 7.12. In case Q=QMwith odd M, it was computed in
Lemma D.8 and in case Q=QMwith even M, it was indicated in section D.8.
The deformed decomposition for the hom space Hom Q1∪Lq(a, b) between two arcs a, b∈Q1is trivially
(Hq, µ1
Q1Lq(Bb⊗R), Bb⊗R) = (Bb⊗Hom GtlQ(a, b),0,0).
The deformed decomposition for the hom space Hom Q1∪Lq(a, L) between an arc a∈Q1and a zigzag
path Ldepends on the choice one makes for the homological splitting of Hom Tw Gtl Q(a, L), but is entirely
irrelevant to the present computation.
145E.5 Result components
In this section, we define and analyze result components for the products µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, h N, . . . , h 1). The
starting point is the description of the deformed decomposition from section E.4. In the present section, we
introduce a notion of result components suitable for computing the products µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, h N, . . . , h 1).
We show that all result components fall into two classes which we call MD and MT result components.
According to the deformed Kadeishvili theorem of section 2.3, the product of the morphisms h1, . . . , h N, m
in the minimal model H Tw Gtl qQis described in terms of Kadeishvili π-trees. Here the sequence
h1, . . . , h Ndenotes type B cohomology basis elements hi:Li→Li+1andmdenotes a cohomology basis
element m:LN+1→a. It is our task to evaluate all Kadeishvili π-trees Twith inputs h1, . . . , h N, m.
For sake of convenience, we use the notation of section 6.2 and 6.3 to denote angles, as opposed to the
notation from section D.2 specific to Q=QM. For instance, we denote the type B cohomology basis
elements by α3+α4. As usual, we start with a description of the possible terms that may possibly appear
during evaluation of a Kadeishvili π-tree:
Lemma E.12. Let ( T, h 1, . . . , h N, m) be a Kadeishvili π-tree with a type B cohomology basis elements
h1, . . . , h Nwith hi:Li→Li+1andma cohomology basis element m:LN+1→a. Then:
•A proper subtree of Twhose input morphisms only cover the morphisms between zigzag paths may
only have result component β(A).
•A proper subtree of Twhose input morphisms also cover mvanishes.
Any nonvanishing result component ris derived either as a disk πqµ≥3(m, . . . ), or as a product πqµ2(id(S2) ,
α3/α4(B)) with direct inputs.
Proof. The statement on the subtrees that only involve morphisms between zigzag paths is familiar from
the calculation of H Lq.
Regard now a product µTw Gtl qQ(m, m k, . . . , m 1) where all m1, . . . , m kare of type β(A) or α3/α4(B)
andmisβ(S1) or id (S2). We claim this product lies in R, apart from the case of µ2
Add Gtl qQ(id(S2) , α4)
and all-in disks µ≥3
Add Gtl qQ(β(S1), mk, . . . , m 1). In these two exceptional cases, the product lies in H.
The first part of checking this claim is to regard the case the product is a µ2. The product is then of
the form µ2(β(S1), β(A)) or µ2(β(S1), α3/α4(B)) or µ2(id(S2) , β(A)) or µ2(id(S2) , α3/α4(B)). The first
case yields β(S3)∈R, the second and third type of composition are impossible, the fourth case yields
β(S1)∈H.
The second part of checking the claim is to regard the case of a disk µ≥3. If it concerns an all-in
disk, then the result is an arc identity id L→a∈Ror id L→a∈H. A final-out disk is impossible, since β
(S1) is an indecomposable angle. If it concerns a first-out disk, then the first angle of the disk may be a
δ-morphism or β(A). In both cases, the result is of the type µ≥3=β(S3)∈R.
Finally, we draw two conclusions: Any h-tree consuming mhas vanishing result. A given π-tree T
with nonvanishing result must therefore consume mdirectly at the root. This finishes the proof.
In analogy with section 8, we can define result components also for Kadeishvili π-trees with inputs
h1, . . . , h N, m. Virtually the same definition can be applied.
Definition E.13. Let (T, h 1, . . . , h N, m) be a Kadeishvili π-tree with a type B cohomology basis elements
h1, . . . , h Nwith hi:Li→Li+1andma cohomology basis element m:LN+1→a. Then a result
component of (T, h 1, . . . , h N, m) is defined in analogy with Definition 8.6. The set of result components
of all π-trees, ranging over all choices of h1, . . . , h NandmandT, is denoted Result πM.
By Lemma E.12, result components of µ(m, h N, . . . , h 1) can be split into two types: those which are
derived from a disk and those which are derived from a product πqµ2with direct inputs. In analogy with
section 9.4, we shall give these two types the names mirror disks and mirror triangles, respectively.
Definition E.14. A result component r∈Result πMis a
•MD result component if it is derived as πqµ≥3(m, . . . ).
•MT result component if it derived as πqµ2(id(S2) , α3/α4(B)).
We denote the set of MD and MT result components by Result MDandResult MD, respectively.
The distinction between MD and MT result components is depicted in Figure E.2. Result components
of these two types compute the products µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, h N, . . . , h 1). The two names MD (mirror disk)
and MT (mirror triangle) have been chosen in order to reflect their use in computing the deformed mirror
in the third paper of the present series.

E.6 The higher products
In this section, we compute the desired products of the kind µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, h 1, . . . , h N). The starting
point for the computation is the classification of result components from section E.5. In the present
section, we introduce MD and MT disks with the aim of expressing the products as an enumeration of
disks. We define a matching, the subdisk mapping, between MD/MT result components and MD/MT
disks. In Proposition E.19, we collect the desired description of the products.
The first step of the present section is to define the notion of MD and MT disks, meant to capture
MD and MT result components geometrically. The key observation is that
•The final input of an MD result component is an odd morphism of type m=β(S1) : LN+1→a
and the output is the morphism id(S2) : L1→a.
•The final input of an MT result component is an even morphism of type m= id(S1) : LN+1:aand
the output is the morphism β(S1) : L1→a.
In either case, we see that the two zigzag curves ˜L1,˜LN+1and the arc ahave a triple intersection at
the midpoint of the arc a. In order to capture MD/MT result components by means of disks, the disk
therefore also need to have nontransversal input sequence. This means the correct definition of MD/MT
disks cannot be inferred from parallels with the relative Fukaya pre-category relFukpreQ. Instead, the
parallel needs to be drawn with the relative Fukaya category relFuk Q. The products of this category
can be determined on a best-effort basis by performing Hamiltonian deformations on the involved curves.
In the present context of the products µ(m, h N, . . . , h 1), this means we have to choose a Hamiltonian
deformation of some of the zigzag paths or arcs in order to guess the correct notion of MD/MT disks.
There is one particular Hamiltonian deformation of the arcs that gives the correct notion of MD/MT
disks: Push every arc aa little into the neighboring clockwise polygon, leaving the zigzag curves in
place. This specific Hamiltonian deformation simultaneously resolves all triple intersections between
zigzag curves in Qand arcs. It predicts us to find disks of two types, depicted in Figure E.3. We
will verify in Lemma E.17 that it is the correct Hamiltonian deformation to capture the products
µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, h N, . . . , h 1). If we had chosen a different homological splitting in Definition E.8, we
would have needed a different Hamiltonian deformation.
In Definition E.15 we provide a rigorous definition of MD/MT disks. For a given arc a, we have
denoted by LandL′the two zigzag paths which depart from a. Geometrically speaking, ˜Land˜L′are
the two zigzag curves which intersect at the midpoint of a. This is depicted in Lemma E.17.
Definition E.15. AnMD disk (mirror disk) is a CR disk with N≥0 inputs h1, . . . , h Nwhose
•inputs h1, . . . , h Nare all odd and do not contain co-identities,
•output is even and not an identity,
•zigzag segments all run clockwise,
which has undergone the following surgery: The output mark, located at a certain arc a, has been cut off.
The odd morphism at ais added as final input, and the even morphism at ais indicated as new output.
AnMT disk (mirror triangle) is a triangle sitting between the deformed arc aand the intersection
of the two zigzag curves ˜Land˜L′intersecting at a.
We denote by Disk MDandDisk MTthe sets of MD and MT disks, respectively.
In the remainder of this section, we show that the product µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, h N, . . . , h 1) is indeed given
by counting MD and MT disks with inputs h1, . . . , h N, m. The first step is to map a given result
component to an MD or MT disk. The description of this mapping is eased by the classification of
result components given in Definition E.14. According to this classification, result components can
be categorized into what we have called MD and MT result components. An MD result component

Figure E.3: The two types of disks we expect to contribute to µ(m, h N, . . . , h 1)
r∈Result πMis necessarily derived as πqµ≥3
q(β(S1), ml, . . . , m 1) where all m1, . . . , m kare of type α3/α4
(B) or β(A). In particular, every miis the result component of an h-tree with inputs being a subsequence
ofh1, . . . , h N. By section 9.3, every micomes with an associated subdisk. To define the subdisk of the
MD result component r, we essentially glue together the subdisks of the mi. The precise definition of
subdisks for MD and MT result components reads as follows:
Definition E.16. Letrbe a result component of a π-tree ( T, h 1, . . . , h N, m). Then its subdisk D(r) is
the drawing defined as follows:
•IfTis derived as πqµ2(id(S2) , α3+α4) with both inputs being direct, then its subdisk D(r) is the
infinitesimal triangle sitting between the Hamiltonian deformed arc aand the intersection of the
two input zigzag curves.
•IfTis derived as πqµ≥3(β(S1), mk, . . . , m 1), then its subdisk D(r) is given by connecting the
subdisks of m1, . . . , m kand finishing with the input β(S1). The output mark is at id (S2) and lies
infinitesimally apart from the final input β(S1).
In Lemma E.17, we claim that every MD or MT disk is the subdisk of a unique single result component,
in analogy with Lemma 9.23. We have to restrict MD disks to those with at least two inputs because
subdisks of result components always have at least two inputs.
Lemma E.17. The subdisk of an MD result component is an MD disk. The subdisk of an MT result
component is an MT disk. Denoting by Disk≥2
MDthe set of MD disks with at least two inputs, the map
D:Result πM→Disk≥2
MD˙∪Disk MTis a bijection.
Proof. We divide the proof into two parts: First we comment on MT disks, then we comment on MD
disks.
For MT result components and MT disks, there is not much to say: An MT disk Dis a small triangle
located on the counterclockwise side of an. It immediately gives rise to two morphisms α3+α4and
m= id(S2) which multiply to πqµ2=β(S1). This gives an MT result component whose subdisk is D
again. This shows that Dmatches MT result components bijectively with MT disks.
For MD disks, it is our task to recover a tree and result component for a given MD disk D∈Disk≥2
MD.
After our long journey in Appendix C, we content ourselves with merely a brief description: Find the
indecomposable narrow locations of Dand place them in a tree, ordered by inclusion. The root of this
tree is the artifical narrow location, which we denoted (1 ,|D|) in section C.4. According to section C.5,
the children C1, . . . , C kof the root all come with subtrees T1, . . . , T kand subresults r1, . . . , r k. Each tree
Tiis an h-tree which consumes part of the inputs h1, . . . , h N, and riis a result component of Ti. In fact,
allriare of β(A) type.
With this in mind, we are ready to associate with Da tree Tand a result component rofT, such
that D(r) =D. To construct the tree T, put all trees T1, . . . , T knext to each other, insert a root πqµ≥3
and connect all outputs of T1, . . . , T ktogether with all remaining binputs and the input mwith the
root of T. This gives the desired tree T. The result component ris the πqµ≥3result component of id
(S2) type simply given by the data of result components r1, . . . , r kon each Ti, bound together with the
all remaining morphisms and mfollowing the geometry of D. The result component rdefined this way
satisfies D(r) =D. This shows that Dmaps surjectively onto Disk≥2
MD˙∪Disk MT.
We proceed by checking signs.
Lemma E.18. Letr∈Result πMbe a result component. Then the absolute sign of requals the Abouzaid
sign Abou( D(r)).
148Proof. First we check the case of MD result components and second the case of MT result components,
both focusing on the geometrically consistent case. Third we comment on the case of the sphere dimers
QM.
For the first part, regard an MD result component r. Let Tbe the π-tree from which rstems. Then
Thas shape as depicted in Figure E.2a. Let T1, . . . , T kbe the children of the root of T, not counting
the direct input m. Then ris derived as πqµ≥3(m, rk, . . . , r 1), with r1, . . . , r kbeing resukt components
ofT1, . . . , T k. It is our task to evaluate the sign of r. Our procedure is analogous to section C.8.
Let us compute the sign of the result component r. Since it is derived as the product µ≥3(m, rk, . . . , r 1)
and the disk is all-in, its total sign is the sum of: the # signs of the δinsertions, the signs of the result
components r1, . . . , r kand the sign of m= (−1)#ββ.
On the other hand, let us compute the Abouzaid sign of D(r). By Definition E.16, the disk D(r) is
formed by tying together the subdisks of r1, . . . , r k. Correspondingly, its Abouzaid sign is the sum of the
signs coming from odd counterclockwise intersections within the subdisks of r1, . . . , r k, plus # signs of
the zigzag curve segments lying between two neighboring subdisks. By Lemma C.21 and Definition C.19,
the sign coming from odd counterclockwise intersections in the subdisk of riis equal to the absolute sign
ofri. In other words, the total Abouzaid sign of D(r) is the sum of the absolute signs of r1, . . . , r kand
the # signs. This # sign already includes sign # βof final input angle β. Finally, we conclude that both
signs are equal.
For the second part, regard an MT result component r. It is derived as πqµ2(id(S2) , α3/α4(B)),
where id(S2) comes from an S2 situation and α3/α4comes from a B situation such that both angles
are composable. Recall that α3/α4is merely an abbreviation for the morphism φ−1((−1)#α3+1α3+
(−1)#α4α4). The relevant result of the product is µ2(id(S2) ,(−1)#α4α4) = (−1)#β+1β(S1), noting that
βis the same angle in Qasα4. Relative to the sign of the cohomology basis element ( −1)#β, the MT
result component rhas a total sign of −1.
On the other hand, regard the subdisk D(r) associated with r. It is a small triangle with two inputs
and one output. The first input α3/α4is odd but its zigzag curves are oriented clockwise with the triangle,
the second input is even, and the output is odd and its target zigzag curve is oriented counterclockwise
with the triangle. The Abouzaid sign of D(r) is therefore −1. We conclude that both signs agree.
For the third part, let us comment on the case of QM. The choice of signs in the cohomology basis
elements, ( −1)#(i+M)+1β′
i+ (−1)#iβiandid′
iis analogous to the choice of sign in the geometrically
consistent case. In particular, the sign computations for MD and MT result components carry over to
the case of QMwithout change.
In Proposition E.19, we describe the desired products µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, h N, . . . , h 1). It turns out that
for any value of N≥0, this product is determined by enumerating MD and MT disks with inputs
h1, . . . , h N, m. In case N≥1, this description follows from Lemma E.17 and Lemma E.18. In case
N= 0, the description follows from inspection of the differential µ1
Tw Gtl qQ(m). The notation Qi+2∈
CJq1, . . . , q MKand ##( i−M+1) appearing in Equation E.2 is taken over from Equation D.1. The index
idenotes the index such that αiis the same angle in Q=QMasβ.
Proposition E.19. LetQbe a geometrically consistent dimer or standard sphere dimer Q=QMwith
M≥3, as in Convention E.1. Let h1, . . . , h Nbe a sequence of N≥0 type B cohomology basis elements
hi:Li→Li+1. Let m= (−1)#ββ:LN+1→abe another cohomology basis element. Then we have
µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, h N, . . . , h 1) =X
D∈DiskMD˙∪DiskMT
with inputs h1,...,h N,m(−1)Abou( D)Punc( D) t(D). (E.1)
The differential µ1
H Tw Gtl qQ(m) is accurately described by this equality. More explicitly, it is given as
follows:
•IfQis a geometrically consistent dimer, then µ1
H Tw Gtl qQ(m) vanishes.
•IfQ=QMwith M≥3 odd, then for m= id L→awe have µ1
H Tw Gtl qQ(m) = 0. For m= (−1)#ββ
(S1), let ibe such that ai=t(β). Then
µ1
H Tw Gtl qQ((−1)#ββ) = (−1)##(i−M+1)Qi+2idL→a. (E.2)
•IfQ=QMwith M≥4 even, then µ1
H Tw Gtl qQ(m) vanishes.
Proof. The entire computation is completely analogous to section 9.5: In section 9, we have shown how
to match result components for µHLqwith CR/ID/DS/DW disks. In the present Lemma E.17, we have
149shown how to match result components for µ(m, h N, . . . , h 1) with MT/MD disks in case N≥1. In
Lemma E.18, we have checked that the sign of a result component agrees with the Abouzaid sign of its
associated subdisk. We conclude that the claimed product description (E.1) in case N≥1 follows as in
section 9.5.
It remains to comment on the case N= 0. This entails determining the differential µ1
H Tw Gtl qQ(m)
explicitly, where mis a cohomology basis element m:L→a. We need to distinguish cases on whether Q
is geometrically consistent or Q=QM. IfQis geometrically consistent, then µ1
Tw Gtl qQ(m) lies in Bb⊗R,
as we have seen in the proof of Lemma E.11. Therefore
µ1
H Tw Gtl qQ(m) =πHqµ1
Tw Gtl qQ(m) = 0 .
IfQ=QMwith M≥3 odd, then we can calculate the differential easily by looking at the id (S2) terms
appearing in µ1
Tw Gtl qQ(m). For m= id L→athere are no such terms, but for m= (−1)#ββwe find a
single type id (S2) term, namely
µM
Add Gtl qQ((−1)#ββ,(−1)#(i−1)qi−1α′
i−1,(−1)#(i−2)αi−2, . . . , (−1)#(i−M+1)αi−M+1)
= (−1)##(i−M+1)Qi+2idL→a.
The differential µ1
H Tw Gtl qQ(m) is given by projecting this term to Hq. Since the term already lies in Hq,
we conclude the desired formula for µ1
H Tw Gtl qQ(m). This finishes the case distinction for Qand proves
the explicit description of µ1
H Tw Gtl qQ(m) in all cases.
It remains to check (E.1) in case N= 0. This entails reinterpreting the explicit description of
µ1
H Tw Gtl qQ(m) in terms of MD disks. This is an easy exercise and we finish the proof here.
This finishes the computation of the desired products µH Tw Gtl qQ(m, h N, . . . , h 1).
F Discussion
In this section, we provide more explanation on the results of the present paper.
F.1 Relation to the literature
In this section, we list seven existing papers which have contributed to cornerstones of the present paper.
For every paper, we explain its core insights, the way our paper builds on that paper, and the aftermath
our paper provides to that paper. The first cornerstone of this paper is the category Gtl Qas a model for
the wrapped Fukaya category. The second cornerstone is the use of the deformation Gtl qQas a candidate
model for the relative Fukaya category. The third cornerstone is the observation that the objects in Gtl qQ
and Tw Gtl qQhave curvature. The fourth cornerstone is the classification of objects in Tw Gtl Q. The
fifth cornerstone is the uncurving procedure for band objects in Tw Gtl qQ. The sixth cornerstone is
the category of zigzag paths Lq⊆TwCq. The seventh cornerstone is the choice of homological splitting
forLand the subsequent lengthy calculation of the minimal model, ending up in a beautiful geometric
interpretation. These seven cornerstones are related to the following seven papers:
•Bocklandt [9] introduces gentle algebras as model for Fukaya categories.
•Barmeier, Schroll and Wang (based on [5]) describe deformations of gentle algebras.
•Seidel [23] foresees the need of curvature.
•Haiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich [16] classify objects of derived gentle algebras.
•Lowen and Van den Bergh [21] demonstrate strategies to gauge away curvature.
•Lekili, Perutz and Polishchuk [19, 20] calculate with zigzag paths.
•Bocklandt [7] demonstrates how to perform minimal model computations.
Those papers dealing with the A-side of mirror symmetry all depart from either the geometric model
FukQor the discrete model Gtl Q. Moreover, we can classify the papers according to whether they work
with deformations or not. This gives the following diagram:
starting point non-deformed deformed
geometric [9, Appendix B] [23], [19], [20]
discrete [9], [7], [16] this paper
The present paper fills this square by departing from a deformation of the discrete model Gtl Q.
150F.1.1 Bocklandt-Abouzaid
In [9], Bocklandt introduces the A∞-structure on Gtl Qand proposes it as discrete model for the wrapped
Fukaya category wFuk Q. In that paper’s appendix, Abouzaid computes the minimal model of an arc
system as part of wFuk Qand obtains indeed the gentle algebra. This way, Bocklandt and Abouzaid
contribute towards the very starting point of this paper, specifically section 6. The paper approaches the
A-side via both the non-deformed discrete and non-deformed geometric side.
As first step of the paper, Bocklandt defines an A∞-structure on Gtl Q. Abouzaid then shows that
this Gtl Qis in fact a discrete model for wFuk Q. He regards the wrapped Fukaya category, as defined
in [2]. He discovers that one can pass with relative ease to the minimal model if one restricts to those
string objects given by an arc system. More concretely, he shows that on A∞-level one can get rid of the
so-called continuation map.
With this in mind, the work of Bocklandt-Abouzaid is a non-deformed prototype for our result: If the
discrete Gtl Qprovides a model for the geometric wFuk Q, then the deformation Gtl qQis necessarily a
model for a certain deformation of wFuk Q(see section F.2.2).
In contrast to Abouzaid’s appendix, our calculations have to depart from the discrete side. Indeed,
a deformed wrapped Fukaya category does not exist as of yet, so that we cannot work ourselves from
geometric to discrete (see section F.2.3).
Our paper provides a new proof of Abouzaid’s appendix in [9], at least on the subset of zigzag
paths. Indeed, we show that H Tw Gtl qQmatches with the relative Fukaya category. Both categories
are deformations over the same deformation base CJQ0K, i.e. they have one deformation parameter per
puncture in Q. As soon as we restrict both H Tw Gtl qQand relFuk Qto the special fiber q= 0, we
hold in our hands an explicit matching between H Tw Gtl Qand Fuk Q, at least on the category of zigzag
paths. This recovers part of the result of Bocklandt and Abouzaid.
F.1.2 Barmeier-Schroll-Wang
Intriguingly, Barmeier, Schroll and Wang are working on A∞-deformations on Fukaya categories as well,
in parallel to the present paper. The subject of their work is known to the author, so we would like to
point out a few relations.
In the article [5], Barmeier and Wang investigate deformations of quiver algebras with relations. The
idea behind the new work of Barmeier-Schroll-Wang is to apply their methods to topological Fukaya
categories as well.
To understand their line of thought, we should look into the work [16] of Haiden, Katzarkov and
Kontsevich. They define topological Fukaya categories Fuk( S, M ) also for marked surfaces ( S, M ) beyond
our notion of punctured surfaces. Indeed, [16] allows the surface to have a boundary instead of punctured,
and the boundary is supposed to consist alternatingly of markings and “boundary arcs”. In the simplest
case without boundary arcs, their notion is equivalent to our punctured surfaces. In the case with at least
one boundary arc, the topological Fukaya category Fuk( S, M ) however allows for a very explicit model: a
graded algebra without differential and higher products. This is the point where the deformation theory
of [5] comes into play.
The work of Barmeier-Schroll-Wang yields results complementary to ours, namely deformations in
the case every boundary component has at least one boundary arc. Since our case of Gtl Qis an A∞-
localization of the case with boundary arcs, it will be interesting to speculate about the relations between
our work and Barmeir-Schroll-Wang’s.
F.1.3 Seidel
In [23], Seidel introduces the notion of relative Fukaya categories. He departs from the exact Fukaya
category and explains how to work relative to a divisor. He foresees the necessity to use curvature for
those Lagrangians that have teardrops intersecting with the divisor, while according to him all other
Lagrangians would be free of curvature. Through his understanding of curvature in relative Fukaya
categories, Seidel [23] contributes to section 4 and 5.
While Seidel does not provide anything explicit in case of punctured surfaces, his ideas carry over
without difficulty: The divisor becomes a finite collection of points, which in our paper correspond to the
punctures M⊆S. Each immersed disk should be weighted with the power of a deformation parameter
whose exponent is the intersection number of the disk with the divisor D.
Seidel envisions those Lagrangians to be infinitesimally curved which have teardrops intersecting
the divisor. This expectation has fueled our expectations towards uncurvability of objects in Tw Cq:
151⇝ FA(S) ⇝ GtlQ
Figure F.1: Markings on a boundary component after [16]
According to Seidel, we should expect that those band objects which are topologically nontrivial and do
not bound a teardrop in Sare uncurvable, while those with teardrop in Sare inherently curved.
Seidel’s definition provides a deformed Fukaya category of pre-category style: Its higher products are
only defined on transversal sequences. At the time of Seidel’s paper, it was not clear how to turn this
definition into an actual category. This was accomplished in general only 20 years later by Sheridan and
Perutz [22]. Yet, their construction relies on the Hamiltonian deformation approach, which renders the
A∞-structure on the non-transversal sequences very complicated.
The aftermath of our paper is a very down-to-earth description of the relative Fukaya category, at least
on the subset of zigzag paths: We describe explicitly all the immersed disks one needs for its definition,
also on all non-transversal sequences. A small caution: Technically, we cannot prove that our explicit
category H Lqis indeed (a subcategory of) the relative Fukaya category, but its higher products on the
transversal sequences suggest so.
We confirm Seidel’s expectations regarding curvature in the relative Fukaya category in section 5. We
also extend the width of Seidel’s deformation in that we use one deformation parameter per puncture. It
would be interesting to reintroduce Seidel’s relative Fukaya category with more deformation parameters
even in the higher dimensional case.
F.1.4 Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich
In [16], Haiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich famously analyze stability conditions on partially wrapped
Fukaya categories. Twisted complexes of the gentle algebra Gtl Qserve as model for their actual work.
Their work contributes to section 5, departing from the non-deformed discrete side.
As first step, Haiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich introduce a notion of marked surfaces. In a marked
surface, each boundary component is supposed to consist alternatingly of markings and “boundary arcs”.
Those marked surfaces where every S1boundary component is fully marked are precisely the punctured
surfaces we use in the present paper.
Using arc systems, they define topological Fukaya categories Tw FA(S). If one restricts to the case
of marked surfaces where each S1boundary component is fully marked, this is just Tw Gtl Qin our
terminology. This is depicted in Figure F.1.
By an explicit analysis of all possible twisted complexes, they classify the objects of Tw Fuk( S, M )
up to quasi-isomorphism. This yields two different classes, the string and band objects. We recall this
classification in section 5.1. This classification led Bocklandt [7] to write down the explicit correspondence
between curves and twisted complexes.
The paper [16] then continues to classify stability conditions on a subcategory of the topological
Fukaya category. The result is that these can be identified with singular flat structures on the marked
surface with given poles or zeros.
In our paper, we depart from a special case of the topological Fukaya categories of [16]. Indeed, a
dimer model Qis a specific type of marked surface. Its topological Fukaya category in the sense of [16]
is simply Tw Gtl Q.
The paper [16] also helps us in section 6 to skip a few checks. Let us recapitulate the claims in
that section: Given two zigzag paths L1, L2∈Tw Gtl Q, we would like to compute the definition of
H Hom Tw Gtl Q(L1, L2). While this could be checked by hand, we propose to exploit Bocklandt’s equiva-
lence [9]
F: H Tw Gtl Q∼− →wFuk Q.
The zigzag paths L1, L2live on the left-hand side, and hence
dim Hom H Tw Gtl Q(L1, L2)∼=dim H Hom wFuk Q(F(L1), F(L2)). (F.1)
We are left with computing the right-hand side. For this, we need to know which curves the objects
F(L1) and F(L2) are. Here [16] comes into play and suggests that F(L1) and F(L2) are simply the
smoothed-out versions of L1andL2. With this assumption, the right-hand side of (F.1) becomes simply
the number of intersections between L1andL2, plus two in case L1=L2. This finishes the calculation
of the hom space, but has cheated slightly in the identification of F(L1) and F(L2).
152Far away on the horizon, Bridgeland [12] has suggested a conjecture regarding stability conditions
versus deformations. The idea is as follows: If we reinterpret the flat structures of [16] as deformations of
the complex structure, they should constitute deformations of the derived category of coherent sheaves
of the marked surface:
Stab Fuk Q∼=Def Coh Q.
Mirror symmetry of punctured surfaces ensures that under some conditions there is a dual dimer such
that Fuk Q∼=Coh ˇQand Coh Q∼=FukˇQ. Here Coh is abuse of notation and mean a noncommutative
version of coherent sheaves, e.g. matrix factorizations. We then arrive at
Stab Coh ˇQ∼=Def Fuk ˇQ, (F.2)
Def Fuk Q∼=Def Coh ˇQ, (F.3)
Stab Fuk Q∼=Stab Coh ˇQ. (F.4)
Simply speaking, the conjecture arising from [16] is that mirror symmetry swaps stability conditions and
deformations. To prove this monster conjecture, we need a solid understanding of deformations of Fukaya
categories. Our series of three papers will set up a deformed version of mirror symmetry, providing an
explicit realization of the correspondence (F.3). The present paper provides the preliminary step of
equating deformations of the discrete model with those of the geometric side.
F.1.5 Lowen-van den Bergh
In [21], Lowen and Van den Bergh explain how to remove curvature from A∞-deformations of dg cate-
gories, a cornerstone for section 7.1.
Lowen and Van den Bergh depart from a dg algebra Atogether with an infinitesimally curved A∞-
deformation AqoverCJqK. Lowen and Van den Bergh observe that a category Tw( Aq) of twisted com-
plexes over Aqcan be formed even with infinitesimal entries below the diagonal, just as in our definition
of Tw′Cq. Interpret Aqas an A∞-deformation with a single object. Then the core observation of Lowen
and Van den Bergh is that the following twisted complex has vanishing curvature:
X:= 
A⊕A[1], 
0 µ0
q/q
qidA 0!!
∈Tw(Aq). (F.5)
This means that Bq:= End Tw(Aq)(X, X ) is a curvature-free deformed A∞-algebra. What is its special
fiber B? The higher products µ≥3onBqare given by embracing µAqwith the matrix entries µ0
q/qand
qidA:
µk≥3
Bq(ak, . . . , a 1) =X
µ≥3
AddAq(δ, . . . , δ, a k, . . . , δ, . . . , δ, a 1, δ, . . . , δ ).
Restricting this sum to q= 0 yields only higher products µ≥3ofA. Since Ais a dg algebra, we deduce
µk≥3
B= 0 and therefore Bis a dg algebra as well. We conclude: Bqis a curvature-free A∞-deformation
Bqof some algebra B.
Lowen and van den Bergh prove that AandBare in fact related by Morita equivalence. This costs
substantial effort and uses the assumption that the curvature µ0
Aqis nilpotent in the cohomology of A.
The result is however that AandBare Morita equivalent, and moreover that Bqis the deformation of
Bcorresponding to the deformation AqofAalong this Morita equivalence:
dg algebra A ⇝ dg algebra B
curved A∞-deformation Aq⇝ uncurved A∞-deformation Bq
The work of Lowen and Van den Bergh helped us understand that curvature is essential in the notion
ofA∞-deformations, but not an invariant on its own. While Lowen and Van den Bergh exchange the dg
algebra itself to remove curvature, our section 5 provides an example where a mere gauge transformation
suffices to remove curvature.
In our recollection of A∞-deformation theory, Lowen and Van den Bergh have greatly helped us
understand how deformations can be transferred from one category to another. We have built on their
understanding that the transfer should happen by means of a L∞-quasi-equivalence between Hochschild
DGLAs while the corresponding map on Maurer-Cartan elements is always secondary:
C HC(C) MC(HC( C), B)
D HC(D) MC(HC( D), B)
∼∼∼⇝ ⇝
153L1L2L3

Figure F.2: The curves of Lekili and Polishchuk in case of n= 3 punctures
As aftermath of our paper, we conclude that there is theoretically no hindrance to forming a derived
category of a curved A∞-deformation: By the definition of twisted completion and minimal models in [18],
a derived category H Tw Cqexists even for infinitesimally curved deformations. The statement of Lowen
and Van den Bergh that a curved A∞-deformation has no classical derived category remains true, but our
paper contends that the study of deformations profits greatly from permitting also these “non-classical
derived categories” H Tw Cq.
Our method in section 5.3 seems to be both a variant and alternative to Lowen and Van den Berghs
uncurving construction (F.5). It is a closely related variant in that our uncurving procedure factorizes the
curvature of ( X, δ) into components of δand new infinitesimal entries. By comparison, Lowen and Van
den Bergh simply factorize µ0= (µ0/q)(qidA). Our procedure is also an alternative in that we uncurve
the twisted complex itself, without passing to a different category D. This way there is no doubt that
we have only performed a gauge equivalence, and checks for Morita equivalence are not required. Our
method relies a lot on the fact that the twisted differential δis very rich, and it would be interesting to
know which other twisted complex categories have such property.
F.1.6 Lekili-Perutz-Polishchuk
In [19], Lekili and Perutz find a commutative mirror for the relative Fukaya category of the 1-punctured
torus, apparently the first use of a relative Fukaya category in mirror symmetry. In [20], Lekili and
Polishchuk generalize this result to the case of the n-punctured torus. They depart from a finite collection
of split-generators of the Fukaya category and compute part of their deformed products in the relative
Fukaya category. This way, they contribute to section 9, with a viewpoint from the deformed geometric
side.
LetT1denote the 1-punctured torus. Lekili and Perutz depart from an explicit definition of the
relative Fukaya pre-category relFukpreT1: Working over the local ring ZJqK, every immersed disk is
weighted by the number it covers the single puncture.
Lekili and Polishchuk regard the n-punctured torus Tn. One might expect that they use an explicit
model of the relative Fukaya category relFuk Tnand then prove it equivalent to their commutative mirror.
Instead, they pick a set of n+1 curves L0, . . . , L ninTnwhich split-generate the wrapped Fukaya category
wFukTn.
They do not attempt to compute the higher A∞-products on this set of generators entirely, but
rather show that the A∞-structure must come from the perfect complexes of some complex curve Tn[20,
Theorem 1.1.1]. The rest of their argument is devoted to guessing which curve Tnis the right one.
This deduction up to isomorphism yields a functor F:{L0, . . . , L n} → Perf( Tn). To extend this
functor to all of the relative Fukaya category, Lekili and Polishchuk view all objects of the Fukaya
category as modules over these curves. More precisely, they regard a fully faithful Yoneda functor
wFuk( Tn)→Mod({L0, . . . , L n}). The right-hand side again maps to Perf( Tn) by an extension of Fto
modules.
In the present paper, we have a very similar desire: to equate the A∞-structure on Cq:= HLqand
the zigzag subcategory Dqof the relative Fukaya category. If we tried to follow Lekili and Polishchuk’s
approach, we would start from the observation that the non-deformed versions CandDare isomorphic
by [9]. We would then compute a few deformed higher products of Cqand compare those with Dq, just
enough to prove that Cq∼=Dq.
In the present paper, we do not follow the approach of Lekili and Polishchuk. In a sense, is a pity we
were not able to guess the right structure like they did.
As aftermath of our paper, we recover the meaning of the curves L0, . . . , L nof Lekili and Polishchuk.
Indeed, let Qdenote the standard n-punctured torus of Figure 3.5b. Then the zigzag paths of Qare
depicted in Figure F.3. There are precisely ndiagonal, nvertical and 1 horizontal zigzag paths. Out of
these, the vertical and horizontal are precisely the collection of Lekili and Polishchuk.
154Figure F.3: Zigzag paths of the standard 4-punctured torus
Our paper completes Lekili-Polishchuk’s understanding of the deformed A∞-structure on {L0, . . . , L n}.
Indeed, we compute an entire minimal model category Cq= HLq, which has the same deformed A∞-
structure on transversal sequences as the relative Fukaya category. It is technically not legitimate, but
we could assume that Cqindeed is a model for the relative Fukaya category. This would mean that we
have computed all missing A∞-structure that Lekili and Polishchuk were looking for.
F.1.7 The lectures of Bocklandt
A recent textbook [7] of Bocklandt explains gentle algebras in detail, shows how to stitch arcs together
to form bands, and how to move towards the Fukaya category. Bocklandt’s book contributes heavily to
section 6, departing from the discrete perspective without deformation.
In its Section 9, Bocklandt recollects the definition of the gentle algebra Gtl Q. Next, he shows how
to stitch arcs together along shared angles. This procedure results in twisted complexes in Tw Gtl Q.
For us, Bocklandt’s explicit stitching procedure makes it entirely transparent how zigzag paths should
be realized as twisted complexes. A zigzag path does not have a unique twisted complex representation,
but there is a particularly simple one which makes direct use of the path’s zigzag nature. This point of
view is facilitated heavily by Bocklandt’s section 9.2.
With this in mind, we can state that the twisted complex construction for gentle algebras is not the
only one where the result can be identified geometrically. In fact, also twisted complexes of curves in the
Fukaya category or wrapped Fukaya category can be identified as being quasi-isomorphic to curves that
result from gluing together the arcs involved, see the book’s Section 6.4.1.
Bocklandt’s textbook contains several more hints relevant to the present paper, namely how to rec-
ognize similarity of H Tw Gtl Qwith the Fukaya category: In its section 9.2, the hom spaces in the
minimal model of Tw Gtl Qare computed. Bocklandt delivers a basis of representatives of the cohomol-
ogy H Hom( X, Y), in case X, Y are twisted complexes model transversal curves, and in case X=Yas
well. He combines these ingredients into a description of some higher products of H Tw Gtl Q.
These calculations of Bocklandt provide a direct starting shot for the present paper: They tell us how
to choose cohomology representatives for H Hom( X, Y) and indicate how to obtain the higher products.
There are also vague indications as to how to build a homological splitting.
Our paper essentially completes the calculations of Bocklandt: First complete the cohomology basis
elements of Bocklandt to an entire homological splitting, at least in the case of zigzag paths. Second,
we compute the entire A∞-structure on H Lq, including on non-transversal sequences, where Bocklandt’s
calculations are lacking. Third, we extend Gtl Qto the deformed case and show how to obtain the relative
Fukaya category. Our deformed case demonstrates how also complicated Kadeishvili trees can contribute
to the higher products, in contrast to Bocklandt’s non-deformed case where only the simplest Kadeishvili
trees yield nonzero results. This renders our paper a powerful extrapolation of Bocklandt’s method.
F.2 Why should it work?
This paper shows that the relative Fukaya category can be obtained from a small, discrete model. But
why should such a small model exist? The question is why one expects the candidate we give indeed to
be equivalent to the relative Fukaya category. In this section, we explain how one is led to believe from
an a priori perspective that it should work, and explain why Gtl qQis suited as a candidate.
F.2.1 The model question
In order to prove results concerning an A∞-category C, one tries to switch between different models of C.
This means, one is interested in A∞-categories Dthat are isomorphic, quasi-isomorphic, quasi-equivalent
or derived equivalent to the C. If such a category Dsatisfies certain geometric or algebraic properties or
size constraints, it is called a model (of the given kind) for C:
155C∼= D
original modelbetter behaved
A standard question in symplectic geometry is then: Can we find a small model Dfor the Fukaya category
C= Fuk Q? Ideally, this category Dwould have very few objects, and still generate the whole Fukaya
category. It does not work however, because cones over a small set of band objects do not yield all other
bands. The question arises how to relax the task so that a small model can still be achieved. A very
natural alternative is to require only that Ciscontained in the model D. Actually, one would not require
C ⊆ D , because Ditself is supposed to have few objects, but one would aim at:
C ⊆H TwD
original modelbetter behaved
Thanks to Bocklandt and Abouzaid [9], it is now known that the Fukaya category is indeed contained in
the derived category H Tw Gtl Qof the gentle algebra Gtl Q. There is a quasi-fully-faithful inclusion
FukQ⊆H Tw Gtl Q.
In fact, the category H Tw Gtl Qis not all too large: It is quasi-equivalent to the wrapped Fukaya
category wFuk Q. In other words, Bocklandt and Abouzaid resolve the (relaxed) model question for
FukQpositively.
Let us now pose the same model question for deformed A∞-categories: Given a category Cwith a
deformation Cq, can we find a better behaved category Dwith a deformation Dqsuch that CqandDqare
isomorphic, quasi-isomorphic, quasi-equivalent or derived equivalent?
Cq⊆Dq
original modelbetter behaved
Let us discuss what this means. In the above sketch, we have used ∼=to indicate one of the four
notions of equivalence. In either case, an equivalence on the level of deformations necessarily requires an
equivalence on the non-deformed level. Conversely, one can transport deformations along equivalence of
(non-deformed) categories. Let us summarize as follows:
•LetDbe a model for C, and let Cqbe a deformation of C. Then there exists a model DqforCq,
obtained as a deformation of D.
•IfChas no good model (of a certain kind), then Cqdoes not have a good model either.
Relative Fukaya categories were introduced by Seidel as a deformation of ordinary Fukaya categories. We
may now ask: Is it possible to provide a small model for the relative Fukaya category? Unfortunately,
this is not possible either. A small model for relFuk Qwould also include a small model for Fuk Qitself,
which does not exist. The right approach becomes apparent by relaxing the task again. Let us first spell
this out in general:
LetCbe a category with a relaxed model D, and let Cqbe a deformation. Does a deformation Dqexist
such that it is a relaxed model for Cq? The answer is that this does not necessarily exist. The reason is
that deformations cannot necessarily be lifted from CtoD. In fact, the restriction map HC( D)→HC(C)
induced by the inclusion C → H TwDdoes absolutely not have to be a quasi-isomorphism of L∞-algebras.
An easy example is the inclusion of quivers
a ,→ ab
c
The center of the quiver algebra CQ1on the left is of course C[a], while the center of the algebra CQ2on
the right is just C2, spanned by the two idempotents. We deduce that the map HH0(CQ2)→HH0(CQ1)
is not surjective. Here HH0denotes classical Hochschild cohomology, which is the same as HH−1in the
156A∞-grading. In short, restriction maps between Hochschild cohomologies are far from surjective due to
“global” phenomena.
Let us tie this back to the question of finding a small model for the relative Fukaya category. We
have already discussed that Gtl Qprovides a small relaxed model for the Fukaya category. As we have
just seen, this does however not imply the existence of a relaxed model for relFuk Qin the form of a
deformation of Gtl Q. One starting point for understanding the present paper is therefore:
To find an A∞-category Dtogether with a deformation Dq
such that relFuk Qembeds quasi-fully-faithfully into H Tw Dq.
A priori it is not clear that such a category Dand deformation Dqshould exist. The reason is that
the ordinary and wrapped Fukaya categories are not equivalent and have different deformation theory.
For the same reason, such a pair is not uniquely determined. There are however several ways of trying
to find such a pair:
A1 Guessing,
A2 Trying out the candidate deformation Dq:= Gtl qQofD:= Gtl Q.
A3 Extending the relative Fukaya category to a deformation wFuk qof the wrapped Fukaya category.
In this paper, we succeed in approach A2: We show that Gtl qQis a relaxed small model for relFuk Q,
at least on the subcategory of zigzag paths. In section F.2.2 we explain why approach A2 is plausible and
in section F.2.3 we explain why approach A3 is promising for mathematicians who can handle wrapped
symplectic geometry.
There are three reasons why the author picked approach A2 instead of A3. First, we already have a
concrete Gtl qQavailable from [10]. Second, approach A2 comes only with combinatorial calculations, as
opposed to deforming and working with the wrapped Fukaya category in approach A3. The expertise in
symplectic geometry on the side of the author was simply not enough. Third, this paper was originally
written not in order to find a small model, but to compute the subcategory of zigzag paths in H Tw Gtl qQ.
The interpretation as a small model for relFuk Qhas come out as a useful byproduct.
F.2.2 The candidate GtlqQ
The goal of this section is to describe why our candidate Gtl qQis plausible as a (relaxed) model for
relFuk Q. The category Gtl qQitself is a seemingly arbitrary choice defined in [10], so that it is a priori
not clear why it should be a model for relFuk Q. There are however reasons why one should expect Gtl qQ
to be a model, even before performing any calculations. In this section, we explain those reasons.
Bocklandt-Abouzaid showed that the gentle algebra Gtl Qis equivalent to the wrapped Fukaya cat-
egory. In the words of section F.2.1, this implies that Gtl Qis a relaxed model for Fuk Q. As we have
seen in section F.2.1, it is however far from clear that a relaxed model for a deformation can be obtained
as a deformation of a relaxed model. In other words, if Gtl Qis a model for Fuk Q, why should the
deformation Gtl qQbe a model for relFuk Q?
There are three reasons why one might expect Gtl qQto be a relaxed model for relFuk Q:
•The derived category H Tw Gtl qQexists by construction, and it is a deformation of H Tw Gtl Q.
In particular, it is equivalent to a deformation of wFuk Qand has a restriction to Fuk Q. In other
words, it contains some deformation of Fuk Q. One may now speculate which deformation of Fuk Q
it concerns.
•A glance at the deformed higher products shows that Gtl qQclosely resembles relFuk Q: Although
the objects of both categories are completely disjoint, every disk containing one puncture gets
multiplied by that puncture. Every disk containing two punctures gets multiplied by both, etc.
One easily becomes suspicious that the deformation of Fuk Qcontained in H Tw Gtl qQis actually
relFuk Q.
•Reasoning with the beauty of mathematics, one should expect that relFuk Qis such a reasonable
deformation that is extends to wFuk Q. By the Bocklandt-Abouzaid equivalence, it then induces a
deformation on Gtl Q, and one may now guess which one this is: probably isomorphic to Gtl qQ.
Against the second reason, one might object that similarity of deformations is not the same as equality.
It might be possible that the deformation of Fuk Qcontained in H Tw Gtl qQis slightly off, even though
the products of relFuk Qand Gtl qQlook so similar. For example, Gtl qQintrinsically multiplies disks by
q. The process of deriving Gtl qQmay change this factor however to q+q2instead. This would imply
that H Tw Gtl qQdoes not have the same higher products as relFuk.
157The fact that this Gtl qQactually is a relaxed model for relFuk Qand the higher products on
H Tw Gtl qQare identical to those of relFuk Qis therefore out of pure luck. We will comment on this fact
in section F.3.3.
F.2.3 Alternative via the wrapped Fukaya category
In this section, we explain another approach to obtain a small (relaxed) model for relFuk Q. Namely, we
comment on the idea to deform the wrapped Fukaya category, labeled A3 in section F.2.1. We will see
why it is realistic, and what the difficulties are.
Let us recall approach A3 as follows: One tries to lift the deformation of Fuk Qgiven by relFuk Qto
a deformation wFuk qQof wFuk Q. If one succeeds at this approach, then one immediately has relFuk Q
as a subcategory of wFuk qQ. Pick a generating set X⊆wFuk Q, typically a collection of arcs that split
the surface. Denote by Xq⊆wFuk qQthe restriction of the deformation wFuk Qto the generating set
X. Since Xis a generating set for wFuk Q, we have a quasi-equivalence
H Tw X→wFuk Q
induced from the inclusion X⊆wFuk Q. The deformation wFuk qQis therefore already determined by
the deformation Xq. In other words, we have a quasi-equivalence
H Tw Xq→wFuk qQ.
Since the right-hand side wFuk qQcontains the relative Fukaya category, we conclude that
H relFuk Q⊆H Tw Xq
original modelsmall
In other words, Xqis a small model for relFuk. We conclude: A lift of the deformation relFuk Qto
wFuk Qsolves the (relaxed) model question for relFuk Q. Such a lift does not need to exist a priori and
it is not unique.
Let us explain how one may obtain a candidate deformation wFuk qQsuch that relFuk Q⊆wFuk qQ.
We can already guess several of its properties:
•On band objects, the higher products are just given by disks multiplied by q-parameters, as in
relFuk Q.
•String objects need to have curvature. There is no technical necessity for this, but it is likely from
the point of view that our combinatorial model Gtl qQalso has curvature.
•The definition of higher products through Hamiltonian deformations needs to be completely revised
to be compatible with the curvature. Due to the new higher products, there now exist infinitesimal
results of disks even on teardrops. The obstruction theory in the definition of the Fukaya category
needs to be completely revised.
This list already highlights some of the difficulties. The author has no clue how to properly define such
an extension.
Let us assume for a moment that the paper’s result extends beyond zigzag paths. From this a
posteriori perspective we can deduce that a lift from relFuk Qto a deformation wFuk qQexists: Regard
the Bocklandt-Abouzaid quasi-equivalence
H Tw Gtl Q∼− →wFuk Q.
Then the deformation Gtl qQof Gtl Qinduces a deformation H Tw Gtl qQof H Tw Gtl Q, and by transport
through the quasi-equivalence also a deformation wFuk qQ. Since H Tw Gtl qQcontains the relative
Fukaya category, we deduce that the same holds for wFuk qQ:
relFuk ⊆H Tw Gtl qQ∼− →wFuk qQ.
In other words, if one believes for a moment that the result of this paper extends to all band objects, then
a lift from relFuk Qto wFuk Qnecessarily exists. Approach A3 does therefore have a solution, although
it is unclear how to construct it explicitly.
158F.3 Why does it work?
This paper shows that the relative Fukaya category can be obtained from a small, discrete model. But
why does the calculation work out? What are the ingredients that make it work? In contrast to the
a priori discussion in section F.2, we explain in the present section why it works from an a posteriori
perspective. In particular, we discuss the role of choices and luck.
Let us paraphrase the methods of this paper. The starting point is the deformed gentle algebra
GtlqQ. The task is to prove that its derived category H Tw Gtl qQcontains the relative Fukaya category.
To achieve this, we need to realize all Lagrangians in the Fukaya category as specific twisted complexes
over Gtl Q, and show that the subcategory of these twisted complexes equals the relative Fukaya category
up to quasi-equivalence of deformations.
How would we achieve an equivalence between this subcategory of H Tw Gtl qQand the relative
Fukaya category? The relative Fukaya category relFuk Qhas mostly vanishing differential µ1, while the
category Tw Gtl qQhas large hom spaces and non-vanishing differential. They are clearly far away, but
the category H Tw Gtl qQalready comes closer to the relative Fukaya category. In the present paper, we
show how to actually match them. During the calculations, four facilitating factors have come into play:
•Zigzags: Instead of proving the whole relative Fukaya category to lie inside H Tw Gtl qQ, we only
prove this for the subcategory Lqof zigzag paths.
•Choices: We choose a “natural” homological splitting of Lq.
•Luck: During the calculation of the minimal model structure of Lq, our choice of homological
splitting proves to be right one both for efficient calculation and to obtain exactly the relative
Fukaya category.
•Fearless calculations: Performing the model computation for Lqemits enormous amounts of data
and requires us to construct a tower of data structures as depicted in Figure 1.1. Binding the
discrete data structures together to form smooth disk requires us to work through hundreds of
calculations and special cases in order to bring order into the chaos. Practically, lots of trees need
to be classified and large multiplication tables need to be filled. This paper performs the calculation
until the bitter end.
We explain these four facilitating factors in more detail in section F.3.1, F.3.2 and F.3.3.
F.3.1 Restriction to zigzag paths
The result presented in this paper is restricted to zigzag paths. In this section we explain how this
restriction eases the calculations and how the general case may be obtained later on.
Recall that zigzag paths are paths in a dimer that alternatingly turn left and right. When we say
“zigzag path”, we frequently refer to their realization as twisted complex in Tw Gtl Qor as a band object
in Fuk Q. Zigzag paths are a small class out of a large set of objects in both categories. Three factors
distinguish zigzag paths from other band objects in Fuk Q:
•The higher structure on zigzag paths is necessary to compute a mirror for Gtl qQ, according to
Cho-Hong-Lau.
•The arcs in the twisted complex representation of zigzag paths have only small angles between each
other, i.e. no full turns or larger angles. This makes it easy to get grip on the disks between zigzag
paths.
•If one assumes that Qis geometrically consistent, a mild requirement, then all zigzag paths in Q
bound neither discrete nor smooth immersed disks. This is very useful.
It appears possible that the restriction to zigzag paths be overcome in the future, even without redoing
the calculations. Let us sketch how this will work. The first step is to prove mirror symmetry for Gtl qQ,
and the second step is to realize that the mirror depends only on the higher structure on zigzag paths.
Indeed, both relFuk and H Tw Gtl qQproduce mirror functors
Mod relFuk →mf(Aq, ℓq) and H Tw Gtl qQ→mf(Aq, ℓq).
Both mirrors mf( Aq, ℓq) are equal, since the Cho-Hong-Lau construction only depends on the structure
on the zigzag paths. The module category Mod relFuk contains quasi-fully-faithfully some deformed copy
(GtlQ)′
qof Gtl qQand so does H Tw Gtl qQcontain the deformation Gtl qQ. Both are mapped quasi-
equivalently to the mirror. It seems that we can deduce this way that (Gtl Q)′
q∼=GtlqQas deformations
of Gtl Q. Together with relFuk ⊆H Tw(Gtl Q)′
q, we should be able to deduce that relFuk is simply a
subcategory of H Tw Gtl qQ. In other words, this should imply that Gtl qQis a small model for relFuk.
159F.3.2 Choice
This paper presents a minimal model for (part of) H Tw Gtl qQ. Such a minimal model is by no means
unique. In this section, we explain why our specific choice of homological splitting works so well.
LetCbe an A∞-category. Recall that by a minimal model for Cone means any other A∞-category
Dsuch that Dis minimal and CandDare quasi-isomorphic:
µ1
D= 0 and C∼=D.
Given a category C, one may look for minimal models simply by guessing. Such a guess involves
•Possibly identifying the cohomology H Hom( X, Y) for every X, Y∈ Cwith some explicit graded
vector space D(X, Y).
•Guessing an A∞-structure on these spaces D(X, Y), turning them into an A∞-category D.
•Finding an A∞-quasi-isomorphism C → D orD → C .
Guessing minimal models requires an enormous imagination.
There are also systemic ways of finding minimal models. In fact, the Kadeishvili theorem grants the
existence of minimal models and provides an explicit way to construct them. The formula for the minimal
model depends on the choice of a so-called homological splitting Hom C=H⊕I⊕R.
Assume we have chosen a homological splitting Hom C=H⊕I⊕R. Then the map µ1:R→I
is bijective. One then defines the so-called codifferential h:I→Ras the inverse of µ1:R→I.
The Kadeishvili construction then describes the H Cas follows: The objects are the same as in C. The
hom spaces are the chosen cohomology representatives H. The differential is defined as µ1
HC:= 0. The
interesting part in the definition are the (higher) products. They are defined as sums over trees of the
form
hµ2hµ3
πµ2
For two inputs, there is precisely 1 such tree. For three inputs, there are 3 such trees. For four inputs,
there are 11 such trees. The result of each tree shall be multiplied by a sign. The sign is given by ( −1)NT,
where NTis the number of nodes in the tree, excluding the root. In other words, sis the number of
nodes in the tree labeled hµ. For instance, the product µ2(a, b) for a, b∈His simply given by
µ2
HC(a, b) =πµ2(a, b).
The higher product µ3(a, b, c ) for a, b, c∈His given by
µ3
HC(a, b, c ) =πµ3(a, b, c )−πµ2(hµ2(a, b), c)−πµ2(a, hµ2(b, c)).
Observing these formulas, we conclude that the minimal model does depend on the choice of HandR.
One may also say: The minimal model depends on the choice of codifferential.
In this paper, we select one concrete choice of a homological splitting for the category Lof zigzag
paths in Tw Gtl Q. The choice looks arbitrary, but has some sophistication behind it. Let us explain the
philosophy behind the cohomology representatives Hin our choice:
•We know how many representatives we have to choose: as many as H Hom( L1, L2) has dimension.
•The dimensions of H Hom( L1, L2) and the dimension of the hom space in the Fukaya category
are equal (either by calculation or by using Bocklandt-Abouzaid). Hom spaces in the Fukaya
category are spanned by intersection points, therefore we should try to find one representatives of
H Hom( L1, L2) for every intersection point.
•For each intersection point p∈L1∩L2, choose the representative in Hsuch that we have the best
chance of obtaining the Fukaya category as minimal model. For example, a disk existing in the
Fukaya category should be realizable as a product µ≥3
Lof the corresponding basis elements in H.
•The signs of the elements in Hshould be chosen such that in the minimal model we obtain exactly
the Abouzaid sign rule, without further sign conversion.
160Regard an endomorphism space End( L, L) of a zigzag path L∈L. Our choice for Hconsists of
two morphism of End( L, L): the identity and a co-identity. While the identity element of End( L, L)
naturally stems from the unitality of Gtl Q, the choice of co-identity involves a choice. We namely define
the co-identity to be any of the angles involved in the δ-matrix of L. In other words, we choose the
connecting angle between an arbitrary pair of consecutive arcs in L.
Why is this a sensible choice? One of the reasons to use the identity for His that it is very natural
and it provides a strict unit in the minimal model H L. This strict unit is simultaneously necessary to
exist if we want to make H Lequal to the zigzag paths in the Fukaya category.
A reason why we choose the other basis element of Hto be a small angle between two consecutive
arcs of Lis that this angle is easily seen to lie in the kernel of µ1: End( L, L)→End(L, L). Moreover,
we want to obtain the Fukaya category as minimal model, which means that we have to reflect the
arbitrary location of the co-identity morphism of Fukaya categories an closely as possible by means of
the combinatorical datum of an angle.
F.3.3 Luck
A decent amount of luck has been involved in the functioning of the present paper. In this section, we
present five specific occasions where luck is decisive. The reader instead interested in a technical expla-
nation why our choice of Gtl qQand the homological splitting are wise choices is referred to section F.2.2
and section F.3.2.
Transparency of deformed cohomology basis After building the homological splitting in the non-
deformed case, we prepare in section 7.3 the calculation of the deformed differential µ1
qonLq. It turns
out that the differential µ1
qof any morphisms falls apart in contributions of certain types E, F, G and H.
Cohomology basis elements come from type B and C situations which restrict the tail to type E disks.
The entire tail of a cohomology basis element then becomes relatively simple: It depends only on type
E disks, and its tail terms are all of the form β(A). The description of the deformed cohomology basis
elements becomes not only explicit this way, but also very homogeneous.
Requirements for deformed Kadeishvili theorem We are lucky that the deformed Kadeishvili
theorem can be established in the full generality. From a technical point of view, the Kadeishvili theorem
is the only part of the paper that is not straightforward. It form a bottleneck for the minimal model
computation and without its working we could not have pursued the calculation.
Transparency of the deformed codifferential Luck comes into play in our computation of the de-
formed codifferential hqin section 7.5. As always in this paper, this computation is rather an enumeration
in terms of disks than a calculation with a concrete output. The deformed codifferential that illustrates
the impact of luck best is hq(βα), where the angles α, βare from an A situation. In this case, we have to
find a sum of angles in Rwhose differential totals to βαplus possibly terms of R. The first-order guess
isβitself, however µ1
q(β) may also contain disk terms from E, F, G and H disks.
We are double lucky. First, the F disks only produce βangles from A situations, the G2 disks only
produce α3andα4angles, and the H disks only produce βandβ′angles from C situations. All of these
angles lie in the kernel of hq. In other words, those angles are in fact irrelevant in order to compute
hq(βα). We conclude that only the type E and type G1 disks are relevant for computing hq(βα), which
greatly reduces complexity.
As for α4, it can be written as a signed sum α4=±h±α3of the cohomology basis element h=
(−1)#α3+1α3+ (−1)#α4α4and the angle α3lying in R. As a cohomology basis element, hin turn can
be written as a sum h=h′+rof a deformed cohomology basis element h′and an remainder r∈R. All
ofh′,randα3have vanishing codifferentials hq, so that we conclude hq(α4) = 0.
Second, the G1 disks yields result of the form α1±α2, where α1andα2are from a B situation. The
angle α1again lies in R, while α2equals d(id2→5) modulo kernel of hq. Since µ1
q(id2→5) =d(id2→5),
we can simply add id 2→5∈Rtoβαandµ1
q(β±id2→5) will eliminate the α2term. Ultimately, every
G1 disk only adds in a simple B situation identity into the hq(βα). This is the reason we obtain the
comparatively neat formula in Proposition 7.13.
The chaos and order of result components In section 8, we introduce the notion of result com-
ponents. The subsequent classification of result components, its matching with immersed disks and the
analysis of the immersed disks obtained this way is a roller coaster ride of case distinctions. Despite the
161intermediate chaos, the result collapses into a manageable description: four types of immersed disks (CR,
ID, DS), following more or less the same rules. This collapse is a very fortunate turn.
Just the right products in HLqEven with a slightly different homological splitting, we might already
have obtained a minimal model H Lqthat looks entirely different from the relative Fukaya category. It
would be hopeless to compare even a slightly different result to the relative Fukaya category. We are very
fortunate that we obtain the higher products of the relative Fukaya category up to strict isomorphism.
F.4 Which calculations can be reused?
The heart of the present paper is a long and very specific calculation. In fact, the starting point consists
of a very concrete deformation Gtl qQof the gentle algebra and the specific subcategory of Tw Gtl qQ
given by the zigzag paths. This raises the question how the calculations and the result presented here
can ever be used by other mathematicians for their own purposes.
In this section, we would like to answer this question. We explain how one can use the gentle algebra,
the specific deformation Gtl qQ, the homological splitting and the notion of result components in a
modular way as standard tools in computations.
We are convinced that while the precise calculations apply only to the specific situation of Gtl qQ, the
versatility lies in the manner of performing the calculations and matching their result with the expected
outcome. We contend that the mathematical value of the present paper mainly lies in making Kadeishvili
trees computable.
F.4.1 The gentle algebra
The use of the gentle algebra to perform calculations in mirror symmetry of punctured surfaces is not
yet standard, as of writing. For example, in [3] the notion is still implicit. Some newer work [16] however
uses the notion actively. In this section, we would like to highlight how easy the gentle algebra makes it
to describe intersection theory.
Second, the twisted complexes of Gtl Qcan be classified up to quasi-isomorphism. Recall from sec-
tion 5.1 that the twisted complexes of Gtl Qcan be classified as string and band objects. Formulated the
other way around, every twisted complex of Gtl Qcan be obtained up to quasi-isomorphism by stitching
together arcs along angles. Regard two twisted complexes X, Y∈Tw Gtl Qstitched together from arcs.
Then the hom space Hom( X, Y) is spanned by all angles from arcs of Xto arcs of Y.
Given a whole sequence X1, . . . , X k+1of twisted complexes in Tw Gtl Qand angles αi:Xi→Xi+1,
how to evaluate the higher product µk(αk, . . . , α 1)? By definition, this product is taken in the A∞-
category Tw Gtl Qand as such is made up of δ-insertions. For each Xi, the possible δ-insertions are inser-
tions of arbitrary angles used to stitch together the arcs of Xi. In total, this higher product µk(αk, . . . , α 1)
gives a result if the angle sequence α1, . . . , α kcan be filled up with δ-insertions to form an immersed disk.
We see that even the twisted completion Tw Gtl Qis an utterly geometric object and can be used for
geometric proofs.
F.4.2 The deformation GtlqQ
In [10] we introduced the deformed gentle algebra Gtl qQ. In fact, we provided even broader deformations
and proved that they exhaust all deformations of Gtl Qup to gauge equivalence. In this section, we would
like to explain what makes Gtl qQso versatile for studying deformations of Fukaya categories and mirror
symmetry.
First, Gtl Qitself is a small category itself and such ideally suited for computations. Its deformation
GtlqQcan be described fairly easily. Already the crude insight that Gtl qQis a deformation capturing
behavior similar to the relative Fukaya category makes Gtl qQan interesting A-side of mirror symmetry.
For comments on the use of Gtl qQas model for the relative Fukaya category, see section F.2.1.
As we recall in section 5.1, the twisted complexes of Gtl Qcan be classified as string and band
objects. As we show in section 5.3, most band objects can be uncurved. The uncurving procedure
adds in infinitesimal connecting angles into the δ-matrix. Let us explain the effect of this procedure.
Regard a sequence of uncurved twisted complexes X1, . . . , X k+1and angles αi:Xi→Xi+1. Then the
higher product µk(αk, . . . , α 1), taken in Tw Gtl qQnow includes δ-insertions of the additional infinitesimal
angles in the δ-matrices of the Xi. This makes that also immersed disks count that are bounded by whole
segments of the curves Xi, instead of only a single arc as is the case without deformation. In particular,
immersed disks between the curves Xithat also cover an arbitrary number of punctures now contribute
to the product.
162In the present paper, we match H Tw Gtl qQwith relFuk Q. In other words, the deformation Gtl qQof
GtlQinduces a deformation H Lqof HLthat looks like the relative Fukaya category. It is interesting to
speculate what happens if we start with other deformations on the Gtl Qside. More precisely, recall from
[10] that Gtl Qalso permits deformations where “orbifold disks” contribute to the higher products. Such
a deformation of course also induces a deformation on H L. Since H Lis a full subcategory of the Fukaya
category, this makes a plausible case for new deformations of the entire Fukaya category. For sure, such
deformations of the Fukaya category have not been discovered yet. Future readers may therefore find joy
in experimenting with other deformations of Gtl Qand for example obtain deformed “Fukaya categories
with orbifold points”.
F.4.3 The homological splitting
Whenever one wants to compute a minimal model of an A∞-category explicitly, one needs a homological
splitting R⊕I⊕Hof the A∞-category. A homological splitting is by no means unique, and different
homological splittings result in different but quasi-equivalent minimal models. The present paper deploys
a specific choice of homological splitting for the category L⊆Tw Gtl Qof zigzag paths. In this section,
we explain why this homological splitting should be established as the standard splitting for L. We also
comment on how to extend it to curves other than zigzag paths.
The homological splitting we choose in this paper is very well suited for the category L. This splitting
is chosen under the expectation that H Lis a full subcategory of the Fukaya category. The reader finds
the definition of the homological splitting in section 6.3, and comments on why this particular splitting
is suited in section F.3.2. In fact, the homological splitting is both the right splitting to simplify the
calculations, and the right one to prove H Lqequal to the relative Fukaya category without further hassle
with gauge equivalence. There is no doubt that the homological splitting is the best one for L.
It is clear that minor modifications to the homological splitting are possible. Most obviously, in the
splitting we present the author is free to choose where to put identity and co-identity morphisms of each
zigzag path (the choices of a0andα0). A few actual changes are also possible: For instance, regard a
transversal odd crossing between two zigzag paths. In the words of section 6.3, this corresponds to a B
situation. Our choice of cohomology basis elements consists of the angle sum ( −1)#α3+1α3+ (−1)#α4α4.
Choosing ( −1)#α1+1α1+ (−1)#α2α2instead is however possible just as well.
While basis morphisms in the Fukaya category have a unique “location” in the surface, cohomology
basis morphisms of Tw Gtl Qcan only imitate this behavior. Basis morphism in the Fukaya category lie
on arcs of Q, while odd cohomology basis morphisms of Tw Gtl Qcan only lie around punctures of Q.
The quality of this imitation determines whether the minimal model computation yields a result in the
desired shape or not.
In our choice of homological splitting, we consistently choose α3+α4for every single B situation.
This has the advantage that many immersed disks with intersection points h1, . . . , h Nbetween zigzag
paths can be imitated by the simplest possible Kadeishvili tree πµ(βN, . . . , β 1), where β1, . . . , β Ndenote
the corresponding B situation cohomology morphisms of type α3+α4. More specifically, the simplest
Kadeishvili tree is capable of capturing immersed disks where two situation B crossings follow each other
within one arc distance. An illustration is shown in Figure F.4a.
If we were to choose α3+α4for some B situations and α1+α2for other B situations, the simplest
Kadeishvili tree would not recognize disks where B situations follow each other rapidly. An example is
shown in Figure F.4b. That figure depicts three curves and a piece of an immersed disk between them.
For the upper B situation the morphism h1=α3+α4was chosen as cohomology basis representative,
while for the lower B situation the morphism h2=α1+α2was chosen. It is impossible to form a disk
µ≥3(. . . , h 2, h1, . . .) in Tw Gtl qQ. We conclude that a random choice of cohomology basis morphisms
makes the minimal model calculation much less tractable.
Let us put the versatility of our homological splitting in the context of result components. Any choice
of homological splitting provides an automatic notion of result components. To exploit result components
for a minimal model calculation, one however needs to enumerate all possible result components by some
target set, see section F.4.4. This enumeration by a target set is not automatic and depends on situational
insight.
In our case of computing H L, the notion of result components only needs to be tweaked minimally in
order to map bijectively to the target set of immersed disks. Upon choice of a very different homological
splitting for L, a notion of result components is still automatic, but the collection of result components
does not biject to immersed disks anymore. Instead, it will biject to a complicated set of disk-like objects
that requires far more detailed analysis. In other words, our choice of homological splitting has the
advantage that its result components have a very simple target set.

It seems possible to find a homological splitting also objects in Tw Gtl Qwhich are not zigzag paths.
The idea is still to sort elementary morphisms into different kinds of situations and to define the spaces H
andRexplicitly. The difficulty is however that general string and band objects have no limit with regards
to the kind of angles they involve between two arcs. This means it is hard to find explicit cohomology
representatives and to check that it concerns a homological splitting.
F.4.4 The notion of result components
Result components are a technical tool serving as the main carrier of information in this paper, see
section 8. The idea is easy: A term like (3 x+ 5y)(2x+ 3y) has the result components 6 x2, 9xy, 10xy,
15y2. In other words, there are four distinct result components, even though the result can be abbreviated
to only three terms. Result components provide maximum insight into part of the result instead of the
whole, and how it is obtained instead of what is obtained. In this section, we argue that result components
provide a means to analyze complicated Kadeishvili trees.
Regard a Kadeishvili tree Twith Nleaves and let h1, . . . , h Nbe inputs for the tree that lie in
cohomology. Then for every node N∈T, there is attached a set of result components. The set of result
components is determined from choice of result components of all children of N. In other words, result
components are an inductive notion.
Let us paraphrase how we use result components in the present paper. We map a set of result
components to “open” smooth immersed disks, which are called subdisks in section 9. This map is
defined inductively: Given a result component at a node N, it is analyzed how the result component was
obtained from result components of the node’s children. By induction hypothesis, every of the node’s
children already has a subdisk assigned. The subdisk associated with the result component at Nis then
obtained by gluing together the subdisks of the children in a way specific to the type of result component.
This provides an inductively defined map from the set of result components of a Kadeishvili tree to the
set of immersed disks.
For some categories, result components are better suited than for others. If the reader suspects that
its minimal model has limited higher products, result components will not provide any use since most
Kadeishvili trees result in zero anyway. If he however suspects that the minimal model calculation will
result in a certain infinite “hierarchy” of higher products, then result components capture the higher
products effectively.
For the reader who wishes to calculate the minimal model of some A∞-category via result components,
we suggest the following roadmap:
1. Find a homological splitting of the category. Typically, cohomology representatives must be found
at the beginning and the rest space Rcan be accumulated on the go. The next step is to perform
a few test calculations of products µk(hk, . . . , h 1), where hiare cohomology basis elements. The
typical node in a Kadeishvili tree has output covering one or multiple basis elements of R. This is
the time to start accumulating basis elements into R. The reader would then try to evaluate some
products µk(. . .) where the inputs are mixed from both cohomology and R. Which inputs from R
multiply to a nonzero product and how does the product depend on its inputs?
2. Construct a notion of result components. The exact way to do this depends on the situation. In
the easiest case, a result component would simply be defined inductively as an output term of the
evaluation of hµat each node, or πµat the root. For other calculations like ours, it makes sense
to distinguish or identify some output terms of hµorπµat every node (for example α3and the
corresponding α4output are always collected as a combined result component α3+α4).
1643. Analyze how result components are derived. It is by no means necessary to classify all result
components directly. Rather, it is important to classify result components into different types and
understand which result components of which type can be derived from result components of which
other types.
4. Determine a “target structure” or “target set”. The idea is to match result components with
instances of some kind of better understood structure. For example, we have identified immersed
disks as the correct target structure for result components Lq. Upon commencing this step, a vague
idea of what the target structure or target set will be may help. In either case, the target structure
becomes clearer as the application of result components proceeds.
5. Matching result components with target objects. This step is hardest. But when performed suc-
cessfully, this step ensures that the correspondence between result components and target objects
can be written down explicitly and in a recursive manner.
6. Perform an inverse construction. The idea is to classify which instances of the target structure have
been obtained via the identification. By constructing an explicit inverse mapping, it becomes clear
which target objects have been reached and which not.
The hard part always lies in identifying the correct target structure and the right identification of result
components with target objects. Depending on what is expected from the particular minimal model, it
might be possible to interpret the structure of a given Kadeishvili tree in a geometric way, so as to guess
what the correct target object is.
The field of homological algebra requires us to perform a lot of minimal model calculations. Many
minimal model calculations can be simplified vastly by choosing a clever homological splitting. However,
minimal models are often not computed in their entirety. An example is Bocklandt’s partial computation
of H mf(Jac Q, ℓ) in [9], which is nevertheless sufficient to prove mirror symmetry for punctured sur-
faces. We are convinced that result components can facilitate the execution of complete minimal model
calculations wherever a geometric outcome is expected.
