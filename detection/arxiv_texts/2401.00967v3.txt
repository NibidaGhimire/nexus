We showthattheseemingly diﬀerentmethodsused toderiveno n-Lorentzian (Galilean andCarrol-
lian) gravitational theories from Lorentzian ones are equi valent. Speciﬁcally, the pre-nonrelativistic
and the pre-ultralocal parametrizations can be constructe d from the gauging of the Galilei and
Carroll algebras, respectively. Also, the pre-ultralocal approach of taking the Carrollian limit is
equivalent to performing the ADM decomposition and then set ting the signature of the Lorentzian
manifold to zero. We use this uniqueness to write a generic ex pansion for the curvature tensors and
construct Galilean and Carrollian limits of all metric theo ries of gravity of ﬁnite order ranging from
thef(R) gravity to a completely generic higher derivative theory, thef(gµν,Rµνσρ,∇µ) gravity.
We present an algorithm for calculation of the n-th order of the Galilean and Carrollian expansions
that transforms this problem into a constrained optimizati on problem. We also derive the condi-
tion under which a gravitational theory becomes a modiﬁcati on of general relativity in both limits
simultaneously.
I. Introduction
TheGalilean limit of general relativity (GR) was ﬁrst computed in [ 1] as an extension of Newton-Cartan (NC)
theoryby taking the limit as the speed of light goes to inﬁnity, c→ ∞. Later development were made in [ 2,3] showing
that the leading order (LO) in the Galilean limit gives the Newton-Carta n structure, but the next-to-leading order
(NLO) gives the type II torsional Newton-Cartan (TNC) geometry [4]. With the growing interest in non-Lorentzian
geometry in the recent years, there have been many papers stud ying this limit [ 5–9]. The methods of taking the
Galilean limit of a relativistic theory are
i) By using the pre-nonrelativistic (PNR) parametrization of the metric which was introduced in [ 10] and further
used in [11]; for a review see [ 12].
ii) By performing the ADM decomposition, then taking the limit of the no rm of the normal vector to inﬁnity. We
call it the “inﬁnite scaling” (IS) method.
iii) By gauging the Bargmann algebra [ 13]. This is motivated by the fact that the Galilean algebra, which on gaug ing
gives NC geometry, can be constructed by the nonrelativistic In¨ o n¨ u-Wigner contraction of the Poincar´ e group.
On extending it to the Bargmann algebra, the gauging procedure giv es TNC geometry. This method, known as
Galilean algebra gauging (GAG) , was applied to study the Galilean limit of GR in [ 14].
A diﬀerent method was proposed in [ 15] where covariant and contravariant tensors are scaled diﬀerent ly (byc−1and
crespectively), although this method makes it easier to take the Galile an limits of Maxwell’s theory to the LO and
NLO, it is equivalent to the PNR approach since lowering and raising indic es is done by the metric with a factor of
c2and its inverse with a factor of c−2, and the two approaches give the same Galilean theories. The localiza tion of
Galilean symmetries are done in [ 16–18]. Since then, the Galilean limit has been used in condensed matter [ 19,20],
ﬂuid mechanics [ 21,22] and string theory [ 23–25] where the NC and TNC geometries are promoted to their stringy
versions.
TheCarrollian limit is the opposite limit to the Galilean one. It was ﬁrst considered as the u ltralocal In¨ on¨ u-Wigner
contraction of the Poincar´ e group in the mid 60s by Levy-Leblond [ 26], and independently by Sen Gupta [ 27] where
they considered the limit as the speed of light approaches zero, c→0. However, there was no physical interpretation
nor application of this limit for more than 40 years. It was only conside red in physics papers in the 2000s in various
but yet limited cases in conformal ﬁeld theories and ultrarelativistic ﬂ uids. The Carrollian limit became more popular
among physicists when a direct connection with physics near black ho le horizons was established in 2019 in [ 28].

†ivan.kolar@matfyz.cuni.cz2
It allowed for deﬁning physical quantities on black hole horizons, while preventing the divergences present in the
membrane paradigm [ 29–31].
As of today, the Carrollian limit has been applied in various areas of the oretical physics. Speciﬁcally, the Carrollian
physics and Carrollian structures were analyzed in the context of r epresentations of the Carroll group, i.e, the Carroll
particles [ 32–35]. In condensed matter physics [ 36–38], the Carrollian limit was used to study fractons and its
continuum ﬁeld limit [ 39,40]. It also found various applications in ﬁeld theory [ 41–44] and conformal ﬁeld theory
[45–48], such as the holography. The Carrollian limit of ﬂuids [ 49–54] was found particularly interesting as it allowed
non trivial motion even in the LO. Some cosmological applications of th e limit were also considered [ 55,56]. The
Carrollian limit was further used in string theory [ 57–59], gravity [ 60–68], black holes [ 28,35,69–71]; particularly
to analyze dynamics of particles near black-hole horizons [ 72–74]. Recently, the Carrollian limit gave rise to a new
theory of holography on null boundaries of asymptotically ﬂat spac etimes [46,75–77].
While calculating the Carrollian limit of Maxwell’s theory, it was shown that there are two nonequivalent Carrollian
limits for any Lorentzian theory. The ﬁrst one keeps the electric pa rt in Maxwell’s theory and so was named the
“electric limit” , and the other keeps the magnetic part and so was called the “magnetic limit” . There are multiple
ways to take the (electric and magnetic) Carrollian limit of a Lorentzia n gravitational theory:
i) By parametrizing the Lagrangian using the pre-ultralocal (PUL) parametrization , then taking c→0 [64,78].
ii) By performing the ADM decomposition for the Lagrangian and set t he signature of the metric to zero [ 44,79],
which we refer to as the “zero signature” (ZS) approach.
iii) By gauging the algebra of the theory and performing the ultraloca l In¨ on¨ u-Wigner contraction [ 14], i.e.,Carroll
algebra gauging (CAG) approach.
Another possibility is by rescaling certain terms and taking the appro priate limit to get the desired theory [ 80]. This
method was implemented for multigravity theories in [ 81]. Since rescaling terms will give a subset of theories given
by the PUL approach, we consider it at a special case. The Carrollian limit of GR was also constructed using the
Kol-Smolkin (KS) decomposition (which is dual to the ADM decompositio n), expanding the resulting quantities in
powers of c−1, then taking the limit c→0 [82]. This method gives the same results as the ZS approach since the tw o
decompositions are dual, and the limit c→0 gives the same result as setting the signature to zero as we will sho w.
In this paper, we show that the PNR parametrization can be constr ucted from GAG. Similarly, the PUL
parametrization can be constructed from CAG. We also show that t he PUL and ZS approaches of taking the
Carrollian limit are completely equivalent (and, similarly, PNR and IS). Th roughout this paper, we consider the
ADM decomposition with an extra real parameter ǫwhich can be interpreted as a signature if it is 1, −1, or 0; the
zero signature case is a Carrollian manifold [ 79]. Once we establish the uniqueness of the Galilean and Carrollian
limits (i.e., the equivalence of above approaches), we construct an a lgorithm for computing the n-th order of the
Galilean, and the Carrollian expansions of a completely generic higher d erivative gravity (HDG). The problem is
transformed into computationally easier optimization problems which upon solving gives the desired order.
The paper is organised as follows:
•In Sec.II, we brieﬂy review the methods used to construct non-Lorentzian gravitationaltheoriesfrom Lorentzian
ones.
•In Sec.III, we give a proof that the PUL and the ZS approaches are equivalent in the sense that they describe
the same limit of the metric with same variables and parameters. Natu rally, the same is true for PNR and IS
approaches. Furthermore, we show that the PUL parametrizatio n and the Carroll compatible connection can
be constructed by gauging the Carroll algebra, i.e., the equivalence of PUL and CAG. Similarly, we also prove
that we can construct the PNR parametrization and the Galilei comp atible connection from the Galilei algebra
gauging procedure, i.e., the equivalence of PNR and GAG.
•In Sec.IV, while making use of the uniqueness, we write a general expansion of curvature and convert the
calculation of the Galilean and Carrollian expansions of the f(R) gravity, the f(gµν,Rµνσρ) gravity, as well as
the most general HDG, i.e., the f(gµν,Rµνσρ,∇µ) gravity, into the constrained optimization problems. We also
present the conditions under which a gravitational theory can be a modiﬁcation of GR in both the Galilean and
Carrollian regimes.
•In Sec.V, we conclude the paper by a brief summary and discussion of our res ults.3
II. Review of non-Lorentzian limits
We begin with a brief review of the methods that are used in the availab le literature for construction of non-
Lorentzian theories.
A. Pre-ultralocal parametrization
The PUL parameterization is the parametrization that is suitable for taking the ultralocal (Carrollian) limit [ 64].
The metric parametrization is the given by
gµν=−c2TµTν+Πµν, gµν=−1
c2VµVν+Πµν, (2.1)
whereTµandVµis the orthonormal covector and vector while Π µνand Πµνis the induced metric and its inverse;
they satisfy
TµVµ=−1,−VµTν+ΠρµΠρν=δν
µ, T µΠµν= ΠµνVν= 0. (2.2)
It proves useful to introduce a Carroll compatible connection by d emanding that ΠµνandTµare covariantly constant,
Cρ
µν=−Vρ∂(µTν)−VρT(µ£VTν)+1
2Πρλ/bracketleftbigg
∂µΠνλ+∂νΠλµ−∂λΠµν/bracketrightbigg
−ΠρλTνKµλ, (2.3)
whereKµλis the extrinsic curvature deﬁned by K=−1
2£VΠ. This connection is deﬁned so that the respective
covariant derivative leaves the Carrollian structure invariant (simila r to the requirement that the covariant derivative
of the metric is zero in the Lorentzian case). This can be gone by req uiring that Π µνandVµ(the deﬁning quantities
for the Carrollian structure) to be covariantly constant. Such co nnection can be derived from fundamental arguments
in the gauging procedure of the Galilei algebra as we will see below.
Assuming analyticity, we again expand all the quantities in powers of c2:
Πµν=hµν+c2Φµν+O(c4),Πµν=hµν+c2Φµν+O(c4),
Vµ=vµ+c2Mµ+O(c4), T µ=τµ+c2Nµ+O(c4).(2.4)
This allows us to express the Lagrangian in powers of c2. The LO (electric limit) will deﬁne an ultralocal theory, i.e,
a theory that does not admit a non-tachyonic single-particle motion . In contrast, the theory obtained in the NLO
(magnetic limit) allows some motion, and it also admits massive solutions.
B. Pre-nonrelativistic parametrization
A convenient parametrization of the metric that allows one to take t he nonrelativistic (Galilean) limit is the PNR
parametrization [ 68]. The metric parameterization is the same as ( 2.1) with the conditions ( 2.2), but a diﬀerent
connection that is compatible with Galilean symmetries:
Cρ
µν=−Vρ∂µTν+1
2Πρσ/parenleftbigg
∂µΠνσ+∂νΠµσ−∂σΠµν/parenrightbigg
. (2.5)
This connection is deﬁned so that the respective covariant derivat ive leaves the Galilean structure invariant. This can
be gone by requiring that ΠµνandTµto be covariantly constant. Such connection can be derived from f undamental
arguments in the gauging procedure of the Galilei algebra as we will se e below.
Now, assuming the analyticity of all the quantities, we expand Π µν,Πµν,Vµ,Tµin powers of c−2:
Πµν=hµν+1
c2Φµν+O/parenleftbig1
c4/parenrightbig
,Πµν=hµν+1
c2Φµν+O/parenleftbig1
c4/parenrightbig
,
Vµ=vµ+1
c2mµ+O/parenleftbig1
c4/parenrightbig
, T µ=τµ+1
c2mµ+O/parenleftbig1
c4/parenrightbig
,(2.6)
wheremµis the mass current which is conserved in Galilean theories. (It also co rresponds to the additional generator
in the extension of Galilean algebra to Bargmann algebra in the gauging process.) The ﬁnal step in the Galilean
limit is to use the formulae above to expand the Lagrangian. The expa nsion to the LO will only involve the LO ﬁelds
hµν,hµν,vµandτµ, which deﬁne NC structure, while the NLO should also include Φµν,Φµν,mµ, andmµ, which
modiﬁes it to type II TNC structure.4
C. Zero signature approach
The ZS approach is a method of taking the ultralocal limit of a Lorentz ian theory. It consists of performing the
ADM decomposition, and then setting the signature of the manifold t o zero. This process results in a Carrollian
manifold [ 79]. This is equivalent of taking the limit of the norm of the normal vector to zero. The ﬁrst step is to
decompose the metric with a Lorentzian and a Riemannian signatures . The Lorentzian metric is decomposed as
gµν=−nµnν+hµν, gµν=−nµnν+hµν, (2.7)
wherehµνistheinducedmetriconthespatialsurfacesand nµisthe correspondingorthogonal1-formwith nµnµ=−1.
The Riemannian counterpart is
gµν=nµnν+hµν, gµν=nµnν+hµν. (2.8)
Calculating the Hamiltonian of GR in both signatures yields
H=Gµνσρπµνπσρ−√gR=Gµνσρπµνπσρ+¯R−(K2−KµνKµν), (2.9)
whereGµνσρ=1
2√g(gµσgνρ+gµρgνσ−gµνgσρ),¯Ris the three dimensional Ricci scalar, Kµνis the extrinsic curvature,
andK=hµνKµνin the Lorentzian case, and
H=Gµνσρπµνπσρ+√gR=Gµνσρπµνπσρ−¯R−(K2−KµνKµν), (2.10)
in the Riemannian case. The ﬁrst term vanishes by the Hamiltonian con straints and we end up with the same results
as if we began with the Lagrangian.
It was shown in [ 79] that removing the terms that switches sign with signature results in a quantity that respects
Carrollsymmetries, i.e, K2−KµνKµν. This is eﬀectively the same as setting the signature ofthe manifold t o zero. We
will do the same procedure using the Lagrangian formalism in the follow ing section in a diﬀerent way, by considering
the signature as a real parameter.
Contrary to the previously reviewed approaches, here we use the usual Levi-Civita connection. Expressing the
Lagrangian in terms of the ADM variables, then setting the signatur e of the manifold to zero, we get a degenerate
metric with the Carrollian theory (on a Carrollian manifold).
D. Inﬁnite scaling approach
Starting from a Lorentzian theory and writing the metric in the same form as in the ZS approach but taking the
limit ofthe norm of the normal vectorto −∞results in a Galilean theory. Alternatively, starting with the Riemannia n
theory and taking the limit to ∞results in the same Galilean theory; the diﬀerence would be only in an ov erall sign
in the Lagrangian.
E. Carroll algebra gauging
The gauging procedure for the Carroll algebra, the CAG approach , was done in [ 14,62,83]. We will brieﬂy
review it and show its equivalence with the PUL parametrization. The g enerators of the Carroll algebra are H(time
translation), Pa(space translations), Ga(Carroll boosts), and Jab(space rotations). We assign to each generator a
gauge ﬁeld as follows
H→τµ, Pa→eµa, Ga→ωµa, Jab→ωµab. (2.11)
The most general connection for the resulting geometry is
Aµ=Hτµ+Paeµa+Gaωµa+1
2Jabωµab. (2.12)
Let us deﬁne an inﬁnitesimal parameter for each gauge ﬁeld by the v irtue of an inﬁnitesimal vector ﬁeld ξµ,
ζ=ξµτµ, ζa=ξµeµa, λa, λab. (2.13)
Using these parameters we construct the inﬁnitesimal transform parameter
Π =Hζ+Paζa+Gaλa+1
2Jabλab=ξµAµ+Gaλa+1
2Jabλab. (2.14)5
The second equality follows from ξµωa
µ=ξµωab
µν= 0. Let ωbe a real parameter. Considering the geneators as rescaled
Poincare generators, We notice that the rescaling of τµandζbyω−1and ofωµaandλabyωleaves the connection
Aµand the inﬁnitesimal transformation parameter Π invariant In the C arrollian limit (where HandGaget rescaled
byω). This consideration will be useful to deﬁne a metric usind the scaling parameter ω. The ﬁeld strength tensor

Fµν=∂µAν−∂νAµ+[Aµ,Aν] =HRµν(H)+PaRµνa(P)+GaRµνa(G)+1

where∂µis the partial derivative with respect to a generic coordinate syste m, andRµν(H),Ra

Rµν(H) = 2∂[µτν]−2ω[µaeν]a, R µνa(P) = 2∂[µeν]a−2ω[µabων]b,
Rµνa(G) = 2∂[µων]a−2ω[µabων]b, R µνab(J) = 2∂[µων]ab−2ω[µa
cων]cb.(2.16)
These quantities can be used to construct the torsion and the Riem ann tensor as shown in [ 84].
F. Galilei algebra gauging
Let us also review the gauging procedure for the Galilei algebra, i.e., t he GAG approach. The procedure is the
same as the CAG procedure but with diﬀerent generators [ 14]. We ﬁrst assign a gauge ﬁeld to each generator,
H→τµ, Pa→eµa, Ga→ωµa, Jab→ωµab, (2.17)
whereGadenote the Galilean boosts. The general connection and the inﬁnite simal transformation parameter are the
same as in the Carrollian case. However, as in the Carrollian case, by c onsidering the Galilean algebra generators as
rescaled Poincare generators, the rescaling of τµandζbyω, and ofωµaandλabyω−1leaves the connection and the
inﬁnitesimal transformation parameter invariant in the Galilean limit. T he curvatures are given by
Rµν(H) = 2∂[µτν], R µνa(P) = 2∂[µeν]a−2ω[µabeν]b−2ω[µaτν],
Rµνa(G) = 2∂[µων]a−2ω[µabων]b, R µνab(J) = 2∂[µων]ab−2ω[µacων]b
c,(2.18)
where∂µis the partial derivative with respect to a generic coordinate syste m.
III. Comparison of non-Lorentzian methods
Let us demonstrate the equivalence between the various approac hes mentioned above.
A. Equivalence of PUL and ZS approaches
Here, we rewrite the formulae used in the ADM decomposition with an e xtra real parameter ǫ. This parameter
should be understood as a modiﬁcation to the normalization of the ve ctornµthat is orthogonal to the spacelike slices,
but not necessarily orthonormal, nµnµ=ǫ. The metric is Lorentzian for ǫ <0, Riemannian for ǫ >0, and degenerate
forǫ= 0. Following the usual ADM decomposition procedure, we write the m etric and its inverse in an adapted
coordinate system satisfying ∂t=Nn+N,
gµν=/bracketleftbigg
ǫ(N2+ǫNiNi)−ǫNi
−ǫNihij/bracketrightbigg
, (3.1)
gµν=/bracketleftBigg

ǫN2Nj
N2

, (3.2)
whereNis the lapse function, Niis the shift vector, and hijis the induced metric. The vector nµin adapted
coordinates reads
nµ= [−ǫN,0,0,0], nµ=/bracketleftBig
−1
N,ǫNi
N/bracketrightBig
. (3.3)6
The metric and its inverse can be written in terms of the orthogonal (co)vector, the induced metric, and its inverse as
gµν=hµν+1
ǫnµnν, gµν=hµν+1
ǫnµnν. (3.4)
One can show that hν
µhρ
ν=hρ
µ, andhµ
ν=δµ
ν−1
ǫnµnν. The extrinsic curvature is then given by
Kµν=hα
µhβ
ν∇αnβ=−∇νnν+1
ǫnµnα∇αnν. (3.5)
It is easy to deduce that K=−1
2£nh. We notice that although ( 3.3) was written in some adapted coordinates the
fact that nµhas an overall factor of ǫwhilenµ=O(1) asǫ→0 does not change. This is because the dependency
on the signature does not depend on the choice of the coordinate s ystem. Thus, we can rescale nµ=−ǫ˜nµwhere
˜nµ=O(1) when ǫ→0. Writing ( 3.4) in terms of the covector ˜ nµwe get
gµν=hµν+ǫ˜nµ˜nν, gµν=hµν+1
ǫnµnν, (3.6)
with
˜nµhµν=nµhµν= 0,˜nµnµ=−1, h µνhνρ−˜nµnρ=δρ
µ. (3.7)
and
Kµν=ǫ/parenleftbig
∇µ˜nν+ ˜nµnα∇α˜nν/parenrightbig
. (3.8)
This is the PUL form that appeared in [ 64] withǫ=−c2. Thus, the limit ǫ→0 gives the same result as the limit
c→0.1This means that the two methods are equivalent. It was shown that the result would be a Carrollian manifold
in [79].
We now present the explicit calculations for GR. The resulting formula e are the same as the formulae derived using
the PUL approach up to renaming of quantities. We can write the ext rinsic curvature in terms of partial derivatives
instead of covariant derivatives as follows
Kµν=−˜Kµν+ǫ/parenleftbig
∂[µ˜nν]+nσn[ν∂σnν]/parenrightbig
, (3.9)
where˜Kµν= 2nσ∂(µhν)σ−nσ∂σhµν, and∂µis the partial derivative with respect to a generic coordinate syste m.
Assuming that the quantities hµν,hµν,˜nµ,nµare analytic, if we would to expand them in powers of ǫsimilar to the
expansions done in the PUL approach. The LO deﬁnes a Carrollian the ory (respects Carroll symmetries), while the
NLO breaks the symmetry unless we set all the higher order ﬁelds to zero i.e, to assume that all the quantities do not
depend on ǫ. This is similar to the truncation procedure in [ 64] to get the magnetic limit from the NLO expansion. It
is worth mentioning that we use the usual Levi-Civita connection not the connection in [ 64]. Although the covariant
derivative does not preserve nµandhµν, we still get Carrollian theories at the end.
Having shown that, we write Gauss relation and its contractions in te rms of the parameter ǫ. Let us begin with

1A Galilean analogue of this limit is to take ǫ→ −∞. This limit gives correct Galilean expansions. Given that t he parameter ǫis related
to the norm of the normal vector. The Galilean limit correspo nds to inﬁnite normalization of this vector.7

as the PUL parameterization of the Ricci scalar up to change of con nections and renaming quantities.
B. Equivalence of PNR and IS approaches
Similar to the previous subsection, starting from ( 3.6) and taking the limit ǫ→ −∞, results in the metric in [ 68] in
the PNR parameterization. Thus, all the curvature tensors in bot h approaches must be equivalent. All the formulae
afterwards are valid for the Galilean limit provided (in terms of a diﬀere nt connection) we take the limit ǫ→ −∞.
The limit ǫ→ ∞gives the same formulae except for an overall negative sign.
C. Equivalence of PUL and CAG approaches
Let us now reconstruct the PUL parametrization from the CAG pro cedure. Using the procedure delineated in
Sec.IIE, we deﬁne inverses to the gauge ﬁelds vielbein ( τµandeµa) by
vµτµ=−1, vµeµa=τµeµ
b= 0, e µaeµ
b=δa
b, eµaeν
a=δν
µ−τµvν. (3.15)
Performing the redeﬁnitions in [ 14], where τµ,ωµa,ζ, andλaare rescaled by ω−1and taking the limit ω→ ∞,
leavingAµand Π invariant, we can write the metric and its inverse as
gµν=−1
ωτµτν+eµaeνbδab, gµν=−ωvµvν+eµaeνbδab. (3.16)
This form is the same form in the PUL approach with ω=c−2. It follows from this fact is that all curvature tensors
will be the same in the two approaches. Thus, any gravity theory will be expanded similarly, i.e, the two approaches
are equivalent.
We now derive the Carroll compatible connection presented in [ 64] from the CAG approach. To do that, let us
deﬁne a covariant derivative that are compatible with the veilbein [ 14] by
Dµτν=∂µτν+Cρ
µντρ−ωµaeνa= 0, D µeνa=∂µeνa−Cρ

whereCρ
µνis the Carroll compatible connection, ωµaandωµa
bact as spin connections, and ∂µis the partial derivative
with respect to a generic coordinate system. Deﬁning hµν=eµaeνbδaband solving for Cρ
µν, we see that the simplest
connection to satisfy the conditions is

(For more general connections see [ 62].) This procedure is the generalized version of the one in appendix B of [64].
It is easy to see from this point using ( 2.16) that the torsion and the curvature tensors match that of the P UL ones.
For example, the Riemann tensor is given by
Rρ
µνσ=vρeσaRµνa(G)+eρ
aeσbRµνab(J), (3.19)
which, upon calculating explicitly, gives the same form as (2.18) in [ 85].
D. Equivalence of PNR and GAG approaches
In a similar fashion to the previous section, we show that the GAG pro cedure leads to the same theory as the PNR
parametrization. This is inspired by the Carroll-Galilei duality which was recently found to hold to the level of gauge
ﬁelds not only the algebra [ 86,87]. Similar to the previous section, the metric can be written as
gµν=−ωτµτν+eµaeνbδab, gµν=−1
ωvµvν+eµaeνbδab. (3.20)8
This is the same form as in the PNR parameterization with ω=c2We can also deﬁne a Galilei compatible covariant
derivative as
Dµτν=∂µτν−Cρ
µντρ= 0, D µeνa=∂µeνa−Cρ
µνeρa−ωµaτν−ωµa
beνb= 0,
Dµvν=∂µvν+Cν
µρvρ−ωµaeνa= 0, D µeνa=∂µeνa+Cν
µρeρa−ωµbaeνb= 0,(3.21)
whereCρ
µνis a Galilei compatible connection, ωµa,ωab
µact as spin connections, and ∂µis the partial derivative
with respect to a generic coordinate system. Deﬁning hµν=eµaeνbδab, we can see that the simplest connection that
satisﬁes the above conditions is
Cρ
µν=−vρ∂µτν+1
2hρσ/parenleftbig
2∂(µhν)σ−∂σhµν/parenrightbig
, (3.22)
which is the same connection suggested in [ 68]. The respective Riemann tensor is given by
Rρµνσ=eσaeρbRµνab(J)−eρaτbRµνa(G). (3.23)
IV. Applications to HDG
Having established that all methods of taking the Galilean and Carrollia n limits are equivalent, we derive an
algorithm to calculate the n−th order of the Galilean and Carrollian expansions of a generic HDG the ory.
A.f(R)gravity
Here we derive the Galilean and the Carrollian limits for a general f(R) gravity theory to the LO and NLO. We
introduce an algorithm for ﬁnding any order of the expansions using combinatorial arguments. The Lagrangian for
f(R) gravity is
L=f(R), (4.1)
whereRis the Ricci scalar and fis an analytic function. We expand fas a power series in integer powers of R, with
coeﬃcients gi:
f(R) =∞/summationdisplay
i=0giRi, (4.2)
wheregiare constant coeﬃcients that are independent of c.
Since all methods of constructing the Galilean and Carrollian expansio ns are equivalent as shown in previous
sections, we can write the Ricci scalar as a generic expansion as follo ws
R=1
c2R1+R2+c2R3, (4.3)
whereR1,R2,R3are the expansion terms shown explicitly in (3.2) in [ 64]; they are also displayed in ( A5). (The use
of the connection does not aﬀect the from of the expansion as sho wn in Sec. III, diﬀerent connections will result in
diﬀerent forms for R1,R2,R3).
The constants giare considered as functions of c(not necessarily regular). Writing
gi(c) =∞/summationdisplay
j=−∞aijcj, (4.4)
whereaijare constants without any cdependency, and expanding f(R), we get
f(R) =∞/summationdisplay

Here, we need to be extra careful since jcan be unbounded regardless of the value of i, and appears in the power
ofc. For a theory to have consistent Galilean and Carrollian limits, the qua ntity 2k−2n+jmust be bounded from
above and below.9

3.(4.7)
As a speciﬁc example we now compute the Carrollian limits of the theorie sf(R) =R+cNαR2whereαis a constant
with nocdependency. The Carrollian limit of these type of theories was compu ted in [85]. The electric limit can be
computed from ( 4.6) by noticing that all the coeﬃcients aijare zero except a10= 1 anda2N=α. In this case i= 1,2
andj= 0,N.
The term where i= 1 and j= 0 have l=−2,m= 0 and n= 1, while the term where i= 2 and j=Nhas
l=N−4,m= 0 and n= 2. Putting all together we get
Lel=c−2R1+2αcN−4R2
1. (4.8)
In order for the second term to couple to some higher order of the ﬁrst term, we must set N≥2 otherwise, it will be
pure quadratic gravity, i.e., not a modiﬁcation of GR. This is the same c ondition derived in [ 85]. The magnetic limit
can be derived from ( 4.7) by noting that the ﬁrst term has i= 1,j= 0,l=−2. Solving 2 n+m+l+2−j
2=i, we get
m= 1 and n= 0. The second term has i= 2,j=Nandl=N−4. Again, by solving 2 n+m+l+2−j
2=i, we get
m=n= 1. Putting all together we obtain
Lmag=R2+2αcN−2R1R2, (4.9)
with the condition N≥2 to get a GR modiﬁcation.
For the case where f(R) does not depend on cexplicitly, the electric limit’s Lagrangian is given by

Here the minimum value of 2 k−2nis−2 i.e,l=−2 (by choosing k= 0,n= 1), and since 2 n+m+l

Then−th order in the Carrollian expansion can be derived from the same minim ization problem by replacing lwith
l+2n.
2. Galilean limit
The Galilean limit uses the same formulae except for setting l= max(2 k−2n+j). The LO takes the form

We will derive the Galilean limit of f(R) =R+cNαR2as an example. As mentioned in the previous section, all
coeﬃcients aij, except for a10= 1 and a2N=α, vanish. The ﬁrst term in the Galilean limit has i= 1,j= 0 and
l= 2 i.e,n= 0. Solving 2 n+m+l−j
2=ileads tom= 0. The second term has i= 2,j=N,l=N+4 i.e,n= 0.
Solving 2 n+m+l−j
2=igivesm= 0. Putting all together, we get
LNC=c2R3+2αcN+4R2
3. (4.18)
For this theory to be a modiﬁcation of the Galilean limit of GR at some ord er, we must impose the condition N≤ −2.
Otherwise it would be a theory of pure quadratic gravity.
The ﬁrst terms in the NLO has i= 1,j= 0,l= 2. Solving 2 n+m+l−j
2=i+1, we get n= 0,m= 1. The second
term has i= 2,j=Nandl=N+4. Solving 2 n+m+l−j
2=i+1, we get n= 0,m= 1. Putting all together we get
LTNC=R2+2αcN+2R2R3, (4.19)11
with the condition N≤ −2 to get a GR modiﬁcation. From this condition and the condition for th e Carrollian case,
we see that no f(R) theory with a polynomial function fcan be a modiﬁcation of GR in both the Galilean and the
Carrollian regimes at the same time.
For the case where f(R) does not depend on cexplicitly, the LO takes the form

Then−th order in the Galilean expansion can be derived from the same maximiz ation problem by replacing lwith
l−2n.
B.f(gµν,Rµνσρ)gravity
We ﬁrst consider gravity theories of the form f(gµν,Rµνσρ) where fis polynomial. We consider a generic term
in the Lagrangian to apply the algorithm, the n-th term in the Carrollian or Galilean expansions is the sum of the
contributions of all terms. A generic term in the Lagrangian can be w ritten as
L=αRa¯Rb, (4.26)
whereRcan be the Riemann tensor, the Ricci tensor with all indices down, or the Ricci scalar, ¯Rcan be the same
tensors with all indices up, and a,bare positive numbers such that the Lagrangian terms are scalars. Using eq.(2.8)
in [85] and raising/lowering the indices, we can write the generic expansion s
R=1
c2R1+R2+c2R3+c4R4,¯R=1
c4¯R1+1
c2¯R2+¯R3+c2¯R4. (4.27)
The explicit expressions are in the appendix. Raising the expansions t o the powers of a,b, andc, respectively, we
obtain

(4.29)
Then-th order in the Galilean or the Carrollian limits can be obtained by solving a numerical optimization problem
as we will demonstrate below.
1. Galilean limit
The LO of the Galilean limit is given by the solution of the optimization prob lem
z= max/bracketleftbigg4/summationdisplay
t=12kt(t−2)+24/summationdisplay
¯t=1¯k¯t(¯t−3)+N/bracketrightbigg
, (4.30)
subjected to the constraints
4/summationdisplay
i=0ki=a,4/summationdisplay
j=0¯kj=b, ki,¯kj≥0. (4.31)
This is a constrained numerical optimization problem that can be solve d by the simplex method [ 88] forki,¯kjgiven
thata,bare known. The solution is z= 4a+4b+2+N. Thus, for this term to be a modiﬁcation of GR, the condition
onNisN≤ −4a−4b. If such term exists in the Lagrangian then the Lagrangian is a modiﬁ cation of the Galilean
limit of GR. The n-th order can be deduced by modifying the constrained optimization problem by z→z−2n.
2. Carrollian limit
The LO is given by the solution of the constrained optimization problem
z= min/bracketleftbigg
24/summationdisplay
t=1kt(t−2)+24/summationdisplay
¯t=1¯k¯t(¯t−3)+N/bracketrightbigg
, (4.32)
subjected to the constraints
4/summationdisplay
i=0ki=a,4/summationdisplay
j=0¯kj=b, ki,¯kj≥0, (4.33)
which is again solvable by the simplex method given that a,bare known. The solution is z=N−2a−4b−2.
Thus, for the term to be a modiﬁcation of GR, the condition on Nmust be N≥2a+ 4b. If such term exists in
the Lagrangian then the Lagrangian is a modiﬁcation of the Carrollian limit of GR. The n-th order is given by the
modiﬁed optimization problem with z→z+2n.
We can see that the conditions on Nin the two limits are mutually exclusive. Thus, no such term (of the for m
(4.26)) with ﬁnite a,bcan be a GR modiﬁcation in the two limits simultaneously. This implies that n o Lagrangian of
the form f(gµν,Rµνσρ) with polynomial fcan be a modiﬁcation of GR in both limits simultaneously. In both limits
we can recover the results from the previous section if we set R=¯R=R. We can recover quadratic gravity examples
in the previous section by setting a= 2,b= 0 ora= 0,b= 2 ora=b= 1.
C.f(gµν,Rµνσρ,∇µ)gravity
Now we consider the most general HDG theory, i.e., f(gµν,Rµνσρ,∇µ), where fis polynomial. Following [ 89], any
such theory can be recast to the form
L=P0+/summationdisplay
iPi/productdisplay
IOiIQiI, (4.34)13
whereP0andQiIare tensors made up of the Riemann tensor and the metric. The sym bolsOiIdenote diﬀerential
operators that are constructed from contractions of covarian t derivatives. Notice that P0is justf(gµν,Rµνσρ) which
was discussed in the previous subsection. The second term of ( 4.34) can be rearranged and written in our notation as

As before, we will now discuss how the Galilean and Carrollian expansion s can be transformed into constrained
optimization problems.
1. Galilean limit

Then-th order in the Galilean expansion is given by similar optimization problem s withzi→zi−2n. All such
problems are solvable using the simplex method.14
2. Carrollian limit
The LO of the Carrollian expansion is given by a similar problem to the Galile an one but with minimization instead
of maximization i.e,
zi= min/bracketleftbiggjmax/summationdisplay
j=1/parenleftbigg

Then-th order is given by similar problem with zi→zi+2n.
For this type of terms to be modiﬁcations of GR in both limits in the LO (in the case of a theory with a Lagrangian
of the form R+L, whereLis the Lagrangian in ( 4.37)), there must exist i1andi2such that

If such terms exist, then the Lagrangian is a modiﬁcation of GR in bot h limits simultaneously. We have shown that
theories of the form ( 4.26) as well as quadratic gravity do not satisfy these conditions. We will leave the search for
such theory (if any exists) to future work.
V. Conclusions
In this paper, we reviewed the methods used to construct non-Lo rentzian gravitational theories from Lorentzian
ones. We showed that all methods of taking the non-Lorentzian limit s lead to the same metric, thus, the same
non-Lorentzian theories. In the case of the Galilean expansion, th e GAG procedure gives the same Galilean theories
as the PNR approach. However, the PNR approach explore more th eories from expanding the PNR quantities in
powers of c−2. Such expansion gives rise to inﬁnite number of theories, one for ea ch order, which are not accounted
for in other methods. However, these theories are not Galilean till t he NLO. The same Galilean theories can be
deduced by performing the ADM decomposition and taking the inﬁnite limit of the norm of the orthogonal vector,
the IS approach. A similar situation occurs in the Carrollain expansion , although the ZS approach where the limit
of the norm of the orthogonal vector is sent to zero (which give th e same Carrollian theories as the Carroll group
gauging approach) is computationally easier than the PUL approach . The PUL approach explores a larger space of
theories, the Carrollian theories to the NLO coincide with the theorie s we get from other approaches by truncating
the expansions of the PUL quantities setting all higher order ﬁelds t o zero.
Having established that all approaches give the same metric, one ca n write general expansions for the curvature
tensors. We explored the most general HDG theory with polynomial f, introducing an algorithm to calculate the
n-th order of its Galilean and Carrollian expansions as follows:
1. We write the Lagrangian and identify which form it takes (is it of the form (4.1), (4.26), or the general ( 4.37))
and if the Lagrangian depends on cexplicitly.
2. We identify the parameters in the respective section of this pape r by comparing the given Lagrangian with the
expanded one.
3. We deduce the optimization problem equivalent to the Lagrangian’s Galilean or Carrollian expansion by substi-
tuting the parameters from the previous step into the respective optimization problem in the relevant section.
4. We solve the optimization problem (manually or using a computer) to get the desired order of the expansion.15
Higher orders in the Galilean expansion are useful to get more accur ate results of dynamical systems in the post
Newtonian approximation. Thus, by transforming the problem into c omputationally easier optimization problems,
we can study such systems more eﬃciently. We leave the analysis of s uch dynamical systems to future work. On the
other hand, although higher orders in the Carrollianexpansion have no utility at the moment, some may be discovered
in the near future given the increasing interest in Carrollian physics, and Carrollian gravity in particular, and having
an algorithm to compute such higher order will be beneﬁcial then.
Another interesting future direction of research is to search for gravity theories which are viable modiﬁcations of
GR in both Carrollian, and Galilean limits at the same time i.e, satisﬁes the c onditions ( 4.42). If such a theory exists,
it is interesting to see what signiﬁcance it has. Is there a deﬁning pro perty of the theory that allows this? If so,
how does it impact its solutions. It is also interesting to apply the algor ithm introduced to study its Galilean and
Carrollian limits, and see how the GR black holes get modiﬁed.
