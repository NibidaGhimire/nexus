The utility of quantum computers for simulating lattice gauge theories is currently limited by
the noisiness of the physical hardware. Various quantum error mitigation strategies exist to reduce
the statistical and systematic uncertainties in quantum simulations via improved algorithms and
analysis strategies. We perform quantum simulations of 1 + 1 d Z2gauge theory with matter to
study the efficacy and interplay of different error mitigation methods: readout error mitigation,
randomized compiling, rescaling, and dynamical decoupling. We compute Minkowski correlation
functions in this confining gauge theory and extract the mass of the lightest spin-1 state from fits
to their time dependence. Quantum error mitigation extends the range of times over which our
correlation function calculations are accurate by a factor of six and is therefore essential for obtaining
reliable masses.
I. INTRODUCTION
Nucleons and other hadrons are ubiquitous in particle-
and nuclear-physics experiments. Predicting their proper-
ties theoretically requires a nonperturbative description of
bound states in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Non-
perturbative QCD uncertainties are now the dominant
theoretical uncertainties in a wide range of new physics
searches in areas ranging from quark and lepton flavor
physics to neutron star physics to neutrino physics [ 1–4].
Lattice QCD has become a highly successful tool that
enables nonperturbative calculations of QCD observables
such as hadron masses and matrix elements with system-
atically improvable uncertainties that are essential to the
success of many ongoing and future experiments [ 5–9].
However, lattice QCD calculations on classical computers
exclusively rely on Monte Carlo algorithms to compute
the high-dimensional path integrals required for precise
calculations of hadron properties. Monte Carlo algorithms
are very efficient for path integrals whose integrands are
positive definite, but the presence of sign problems – in-
tegrands with sign or complex-phase fluctuations – leads
to computational resource requirements that grow expo-
nentially with system size [ 10]. Many systems of interest
cannot presently be studied with lattice QCD using clas-
sical computers because of challenges arising from sign
problems, including all systems involving nonequilibrium
real-time evolution. Although there has been progress
in developing novel classical lattice gauge theory (LGT)
algorithms [ 11–14], simulations of the dynamics of four-
dimensional LGTs relevant for studying hadronizationof quarks and gluons, heavy-ion collisions, and phase
transitions in the early universe remain unfeasible.
Quantum computers offer the possibility to simulate
real-time dynamics of LGTs without sign problems by
using Hamiltonian time evolution of quantum states in-
stead of Monte-Carlo evaluations of path integrals [ 15].
As with the evolution of LGT on classical computers,
however, realizing this potential will require a sustained
effort over many years to understand and address theo-
retical issues, develop and test efficient algorithms, and
identify and control systematic uncertainties. Therefore,
even though large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers
capable of realistic four-dimensional lattice gauge theory
(LGT) simulations will not be realized for many years, it
is timely to begin exploring the possibilities and tackling
the challenges associated with quantum simulations of
LGTs.
Extracting accurate physical results from noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware requires
quantifying and reducing systematic uncertainties. Sub-
stantial effort has been dedicated to developing and test-
ing strategies for quantum error mitigation (QEM) in
quantum simulations for chemistry, physics, and math-
ematics [ 16–38]. In LGT calculations, the use [ 39–48]
and systematic study [ 49–64] of QEM techniques has pri-
marily focused on using zero noise extrapolation, random
compilation, and readout error mitigation. Because many
approaches for digitization of LGTs (see Sec VI.b of [ 65]
for a review) have been proposed, it will be illuminating
to compare their performance on currently accessible sys-
tems to understand which approaches should be pursued
for large-scale quantum simulations.arXiv:2305.02361v2  [hep-lat]  27 Oct 20232
Quantum electrodynamics (QED) in 1 + 1 d, also called
the Schwinger model [ 66], demonstrates both chiral
symmetry breaking and confinement. Therefore, the
Schwinger model and its approximations provide rel-
atively simple yet nontrivial tests cases for quantum
simulation methods, and have been the focus of much
activity. State-preparation techniques using adiabatic
[67,68] and variational [ 69–71] methods as well as thermal-
pure-quantum states [ 72] have been tested. Ground
state properties have been calculated at finite temper-
ature [ 70,73] and density [ 71,72], including topological
terms [ 68,74,75]. Additional work has studied non-
equilibrium dynamics [ 73,76] and the role of dynamical
quantum phase transitions [ 77,78]. Error mitigation [ 59]
and correction [ 64,79] strategies have been developed for
the Schwinger model, and practical resource estimates
have been derived for some digitization schemes [80].
In this work, we simulate 1 + 1 dZ2gauge theory with
a single massive fermion, which is the simplest discrete
subgroup approximation of the Schwinger model, [ 74,81–
83]1as well as a model of condensed matter Luttinger
liquid systems with interesting phenomena that has at-
tracted recent interest [ 83,86–92]. We compute real-time
(Minkowski) two-point correlation functions and extract
the energy of the lowest-lying spin-1 state from their
time dependence. In the infinite-volume, continuum limit
this energy corresponds to the mass of the lightest spin-1
fermion-antifermion bound state in the theory. In realistic
four-dimensional LGT studies, a set of analogous quanti-
ties can be matched to experimentally measured particle
masses in order to set the scale of the lattice spacing in
physical units and fix the quark masses. This scale setting
is a necessary step before calculations of other spectral
quantities can be used to predict other particle masses as
well as some non-equilibrium observables. Strategies for
determining the lattice spacing in quantum simulations
have been proposed in Refs. [93–95].
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
We first discuss in Sec. II the Hamiltonian time evolution
inZ2gauge theory and its implementation via quantum
circuits in Sec. II. Sec. III discusses the study of QEM
strategies for these circuits. We apply the QEM strategies
in Sec. IV to compute the real-time evolution of fermion-
antifermion bound states and determine the mass gap
from these results. The performance and interplay of
various QEM techniques is detailed for simulations using
multiple IBM quantum computers. Finally, we conclude
with a discussion of the results and future work in Sec. V.
1Other proposed schemes for rendering the photon-field Hilbert
space finite dimensional include truncating the compact QED
variables [ 67], quantum link models [ 84], and quantum cellular
automatons [85].

FIG. 1. Pictorial representation of the Ns= 4 one-dimensional
lattice used in this work. The lattice is represented using seven
qubits: two represent “electron” components of the staggered
fermionen(green), two represent the analogous “positron”
components pn(red), and three represent Z2-valued “photon”
fields for which operators are labeled by adjacent pairs of
lattice sites, e.g. σn,n+1(orange).
II. THEORY
In this work we use the Kogut-Susskind lattice Hamil-
tonian for 1 + 1 dZ2gauge theory with two-component
staggered fermionic matter and open boundary conditions
(OBCs) [ 96,97].2A convenient feature of this model is
that both the fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom
have the same local Hilbert space dimension as qubits.
This allows for a straightforward mapping to qubit-based
quantum computers. Further simplifications are possible
in 1 + 1dto reduce the quantum resources required, e.g.,
integrating out the nondynamical gauge fields or using
the block structure of the symmetry sectors. We do not
employ such optimizations here, however, since they do
not persist in higher dimensions [98].
Our simulations were performed on the IBM quantum
computers ibmq manila ,ibmnairobi ,ibmq jakarta ,
and ibmq quito . Typical specifications for these ma-
chines during our running period are provided in the
files accompanying this work, while their physical qubit
layouts are shown in Fig. 2.

term, the fermion hopping term, and the fermion mass
term, respectively. For the remainder of the paper, we

in lattice-spacing units.
In the Kogut-Susskind fermion formulation, a single
2-component spinor ψ(x) is described by two 1-component
staggered fields ψnon neighboring sites. Here we denote
the components on even sites by pn(for positron) and
the components on odd sites by en(for electron). The
field content of an Ns-site lattice with OBCs is Ns/2
electron sites, Ns/2 positron sites, and Ns−1 gauge-field
links where Nsmust be even. A depiction for the case of
Ns= 4 is provided in Fig. 1.

II.2. Circuits
ForZ2lattice gauge theory with Kogut-Susskind
fermions, the state of each fermion component and gauge
field can be encoded in a single qubit. Hence, a lattice
withNssites (or, equivalently, Nx=Ns/2 spatial points)
can be encoded in Nq= 2Ns−1 = 4Nx−1 qubits. Here
we simulate 2-site and 4-site systems using 3 and 7 qubits,
respectively.
We approximate the time evolution operator U(t) =
e−itHvia second order Trotterization [100–102] as,
U(t)≈U(t/ε)Nt, (3)whereNtis an integer and ϵ≡t/Nt. Performing sim-
ulations of real-time evolution on a quantum computer
requires encoding U(t/ε) as a quantum circuit. To sim-
plify the circuit encoding, we first express the Hamiltonian
as a sum of three commuting operators

each of which is easily diagonalizable. Operator H1com-
prises the gauge-kinetic and fermion-mass terms, while
H2andH3are the even- and odd-site fermion-hopping
terms, respectively. In terms of the Hi, the Hamiltonian
in Eq. (2) is given by
H=3/summationdisplay
i=1Hi, (5)
and the Trotterized time-evolution operator in Eq. (3) is
U(t/ε) =3/productdisplay
i=1Ui(t/ε), (6)
where
Ui(t)≡e−itHi. (7)
For the simulations described in this work, we time
evolve the quantum system using the circuits shown in
Fig. 3. Operator U1requires only single-qubit gates, and
we employ the simple circuit implementation shown in the
left panel. Operators U2andU3require entangling gates
because the hopping term couples neighboring fermion
and gauge degrees of freedom. They can be represented
by the same quantum circuit; however, since H2andH3
differ only by the lattice sites upon which they act. We
employ the two equivalent circuit representations of the
hopping-term operator in our simulations, Ufh,1andUfh,2.
These are shown in the upper- and lower-right panels,
respectively. Because the locations of the entangling
CNOT gates differ between Ufh,1andUfh,2, combining
both circuit variations allows us to more efficiently use the
available quantum hardware without the need for costly
SWAP gates.
For circuitUfh,1, in which the fermion and anti-fermion
are coupled via a central gauge field, the physical qubit
layout matches the 1 dlattice picture in Fig. 1. This
straightforward implementation has been employed in re-
cent quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model
and its approximations e.g. [ 68,71,73], and it is well-
suited to quantum hardware with linear topology. Many4

FIG. 3. The quantum circuit U1implementing the gauge kinetic term and the fermion mass term is shown in the left panel. In
the right panel, two equivalent quantum circuits implementing the fermion hopping term appearing in U2andU3are shown.
These two circuits have different qubit connectivities and are used in conjunction to provide efficient mappings between logical
and physical qubits as described in the main text.
NISQ-era computers, however, have nonlinear qubit lay-
outs [ 103–106]. On these devices, the number of lattice
sites that can be simulated using the hopping-term circuit
layoutUfh,1is limited by the longest linear graph, and
the resulting efficiency loss can be substantial. For ex-
ample, on the machines ibmq jakarta andibmnairobi
(see Fig. 2 a), with the standard qubit layout Ufh,1only
3 out of 7 qubits would usable, thereby wasting over 60%
of the available resources.
To address this limitation, we employed circuit iden-
tities to derive from the standard circuit Ufh,1a new
circuitUfh,2in which the gauge and anti-fermion fields
are coupled via a central fermion. Using both fermion
hopping-term circuits together allows us to employ all 7
quibits on ibmq jakarta and ibmnairobi in our quan-
tum simulations. Further, these two circuits form a basis
for efficient 1+1d Z2simulations using all qubits on any
quantum device with heavy-polygon topology.3To illus-
trate howUfh,1andUfh,2can be effectively combined,
Fig. 4 shows an example circuit mapping of 1+1d Z2LGT
with 5 spatial points onto a 22-qubit heavy-square device.
This is the maximum possible efficiency since simulating
this system with Nxspatial points requires 4 Nx−1 qubits
as discussed above.

Measurements of |C(t)|2from quantum simulations can

Because we do not explicitly project to the gauge-
invariant sector of Hilbert space during time evolution, our
simulations must start with gauge-invariant initial states
in order to construct gauge-invariant correlation functions.
Here we choose our initial state to be a linear superpo-
sition of two gauge-invariant states: the non-interacting
vacuum state|Ω⟩and a state|P⟩that is expected to have
significant overlap with excited states such as electron-
positron bound states. Explicitly, the states |Ω(Ns)⟩and5
|P(Ns)⟩are defined for lattices of size Nsas

this state and the operator

This operator takes a simple form in the qubit spin basis:

which allows it to be included efficiently in quantum
simulations. Further, using Eq. (10) shows that diagonal
matrix elements of Ovanish for these states,
⟨Ω(Ns)|O|Ω(Ns)⟩= 0 =⟨P(Ns)|O|P(Ns)⟩,(14)
while off-diagonal matrix elements are unity,
⟨Ω(Ns)|O|P(Ns)⟩= 1 =⟨Ω(Ns)|O|P(Ns)⟩.(15)
Thus, the value of C(t= 0) can be computed exactly:
C(0) =⟨ϕ(Ns)|O|ϕ(Ns)⟩= 1. (16)
Correlation functions C(t) defined using this state as in
Eq.(8)have time-dependence generically given by Eq. (9),
and in the limit of large ttheir Fourier transformations
should be sharply peaked about values corresponding
to some energy differences. If |Ω⟩and|P⟩each overlap
predominantly with a single energy eigenstate with energy
EΩandEP, respectively, then the time-dependence of
C(t) reduces to the simple form

Fits of quantum simulation results to Eq. (18) can be
used to study the validity of this approximation. If the
single-state contribution cos(Mt) provides a good fit to
correlation function results, then the fit parameter M
can be expected to describe the energy gap between an
electron-positron bound state and the vacuum, which
corresponds to the mass of the particle associated with
this state in the continuum and infinite-volume limits.
This accuracy of this method can be directly tested by
comparing fitted results for Mwith exact spectral results,
which can be numerically computed on classical computers
for smallNs.

III. ERROR MITIGATION OF A QUANTUM
SIMULATION
Many quantum error mitigation strategies have been
studied for reducing the systematic uncertainties associ-
ated with errors in NISQ era quantum simulations. A
primary goal of this work is to study the interplay between
different QEM methods and the reliability of quantum
simulation results using combinations of state-of-the-art
methods. This section briefly introduces the QEM meth-
ods that we found to provide significant improvements in
these calculations: randomized compiling, readout error
mitigation, rescaling, and dynamic decoupling.
These QEM strategies introduce additional correlations
between quantum simulation results, and it is important
to accurately determine and include these correlations
in analyses of quantum simulation results. Throughout
this work we use bootstrap resampling [ 108–110] to deter-
mine all statistical uncertainties and correlations between
observables, in particular using correlated resampling of6

We performed quantum simulations of C(t) using the
parameter choices m0∈{1,2}andNs∈{2,4}in the
Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) with η= 1 in all cases. Each
simulation was performed for Nt= 20 Trotter steps with
ε= 0.3. For each Nt,Nrc= 30 randomly compiled
circuits were run with Nmeas = 2,000 measurements
collected for each. These production simulations were
carried out on ibmnairobi andibmq jakarta while ad-
ditional testing simulations were also investigated on
ibmq manila and ibmq quito . The full details of the
simulations are listed in Table I. For each simulation,
we performed Nmeas =NshotsNrc= 6×104measure-

ments. Bootstrap covariance matrices were determinedfor all correlated observables and the associated uncertain-
ties were propagated to fitted quantities in a correlated
way using the gvar andlsqfit packages [111–115].
III.1. Randomized Compiling
Randomized compiling (RC) transforms coherent sys-
tematic uncertainties associated with the imperfect fidelity
of quantum gates into stochastic systematic uncertainties
that can be quantified with a Markovian noise model
[116–123]. It has seen great success in other (1+1) dLGT
applications [ 45,46,48,63,124]. At present it must be
implemented by hand, but it is expected to become a
standard part of transpilation through parametric com-
pilation [ 125–131]. RC utilizes multiple gates that are
equivalent in the absence of noise but that differ in the
presence of gate errors. Therefore, the averages of the re-
sults often have smaller errors than any individual circuit
and the variance of the results provides a partial measure
of the size of systematic uncertainties arising from gate
errors.
A strategy for implementing randomized compiling is
“Pauli twirling”, in which a gate Λ is replaced by a gate
including additional sets of Pauli gates {σi}and{σ′
i},
whereiindexes the qubits acted on by Λ, that are chosen
to satisfy [120, 122]
/bracketleftigg/circlemultiplydisplay
iσi/bracketrightigg
Λ
/circlemultiplydisplay
jσ′
j
= Λ. (20)
Any solution to Eq. (20) provides a valid gate that is
equivalent to Λ on an ideal quantum computer and can
be used for randomized compiling. For any choice of
{σi}, the{σ′
i}required to produce such a solution is
simply obtained by multiplying both sides Eq. (20) by
the inverses of the gates appearing and is given by

/circlemultiplydisplay

j
= Λ†/bracketleftigg/circlemultiplydisplay
iσi/bracketrightigg
Λ. (21)
For complicated gates such as the fermion hopping term
above, 64 solutions to Eq. (21) can be produced in this
manner, while for the CNOT there are 16. In order to
better handle circuit scheduling constraints on cloud com-
puting platforms, a random set of NRCsolutions can be
chosen at compile time, with solutions chosen indepen-
dently for each instance of Λ appearing in a quantum
circuit. The optimal value of Ntwirldepends on both Λ
and the hardware is run and can be determined empiri-
cally by increasing Ntwirluntil the effects of randomized
compiling saturate or are offset by a prohibitively larger
number of simulations.
Pauli twirling removes correlations between repeated
Λ, but any internal correlations persist. Thus as the
correlation between native gates decreases with hardware
and implementation improvements, resources devoted to7

Pauli twirling can be reduced by only implementing them
for larger gates like Ufh. On the present systems, we
investigated Pauli twirling at the level of Ufhand at the
level of the CNOTs within it. A mild but statistically
significant preference to twirling the CNOTs was observed
which will be used for the remainder of this work.
III.2. Readout Error Mitigation
The measurement operation on quantum computers
is quite noisy. There are many causes for these errors
such as classical bit-flips, amplitude dampening, and cross
talk [ 132–138]. It is important to mitigate these errors as
they will bias the observed value of an operator measured
on a quantum computer.
While many methods to correct these errors exist [ 139–
144], we use regularized response matrix inversion [ 145–
149]. For a single qubit if we prepare the system in the
state|0⟩there is a probability p0that we measure the
qubit in the state |0⟩and a probability 1 −p0that we
measure it in the|1⟩state. We can then use these and the
analogous probabilities for an initial |1⟩state to constructa calibration matrix,
M=/parenleftigg
p01−p0
1−p1p1/parenrightigg
. (22)
By acting on the vector of measured qubit state results
withM−1, one can mitigate readout error and return a
“corrected” output closer to the underlying distribution.
Assuming that readout errors are uncorrelated, we can
construct a tensor product M⊗Nand correct the readouts
individually rather than the exponentially time consum-
ing task of measuring all possible elements of the full
readout correction matrix. Qiskit RunTime has readout
mitigation built in [150].
The size of readout mitigation effects will depend on
the observable under study, which is taken to be C(t)
below. The calibration matrix may introduce correla-
tions between any simulations that are transformed using
the same estimated process. The absolute shift in the
correlation function due to readout mitigation is defined
as
A(t) =|CRO(t)−Craw(t)|, (23)
where CRO(t) is the readout mitigated observable and
Craw(t) is the observable calculated using the unmitigated8

|Craw(t)|. (24)
Figure 6 shows the relative shift of the observable as a
function of the observable magnitude for the simulations
performed on ibmnairobi . The relative independence of
RonCrawindicates that the absolute size Aof readout
mitigation effects is correlated with, and in particular
approximately proportional to, Craw. This is not un-
expected as errors on physical hardware are commonly
asymmetric [ 151]. Similar patterns were observed on
ibmq jakarta and together we can conclude the relative
shift is approximately constant with circuit depth as seen
in Fig. 7.

FIG. 9. Correlation matrices (that is, normalized covariance
matrices) for circuits with different numbers of Trotter steps
for the representative case of simulations with m0= 1 and
Ns= 2.
Separate simulations with the same or different numbers
of Trotter steps may become correlated because of the
calibration matrix. The correlations between randomly
compiled circuits were observed to be ≲5%. Including
these correlations has a noticeable effect when averaging
these circuits, as seen in Fig. 8.
Figure 9 shows the correlations introduced by readout
mitigation between different time steps for the same pa-
rameters as Fig. 8. It is unsurprising that observables
involving different numbers of Trotter steps are less sig-
nificantly correlated than those with the same number9
because the wave function is not as similar.
III.3. Rescaling
Measured observables will include an exponential de-
cay with respect to the circuit depth [ 152]. It is pos-
sible to counteract this signal damping using rescal-
ing [62,153,154]. This method rescales the measurements
of one set of circuits using information from a related set
of circuits. The first set is the randomly compiled quan-
tum simulation circuits C(t) of interest. The second set
uses the same circuits except all non-Clifford gates are
removed, which is denoted r(t). The first set of circuits
has an unknown output that the quantum simulation is
designed to determine. On the other hand, the second
set containing only Clifford gates can be efficiently simu-
lated classically [ 155]. Such classical algorithms can be
extended further to some cases where some non-Clifford
gates are allowed [ 156,157]. This allows for comparison
between the exact answer and the noisy result which can
be used to mitigate some errors.
On a quantum computer, assuming only a depolarizing
noise channel, the noisy estimate /tildewider(t) of the classically
computable observable r(t) is,
/tildewider(t) = (1−ε)r(t) +ε
2n⟨Tr[Ur(t)]⟩, (25)
whereUr(t) is an operator satisfying r(t) =⟨Ur(t)⟩for
expectation values taken in the state |ϕ(Ns)⟩andεis the
strength of the depolarizing noise. Since Ur(t) in our case
is traceless and Hermitian because it is a tensor product
of Pauli matrices, the result simplifies to /tildewider(t) = (1−ε)r(t).
Sincer(t) is easily computable, we can determine (1 −ε)
from a measurement of /tildewider(t). Then we can correct for
the same depolarizing noise in our correlation function of
interest by rescaling the analogous noisy estimator /tildewideC(t) by
(1−ε)−1[62,153,154]. The resulting rescaled correlation
function is given by
CRescaled (t) =/tildewideC(t)
1−ε=/tildewideC(t)r(t)
/tildewider(t). (26)
This method is less feasible for long depth circuits because
/tildewider(t) can be vanishingly small. A pictorial representation
is shown in Fig. 10. The efficacy of rescaling is found
to depend significantly on whether or not dynamical de-
coupling is included and is discussed further in the next
section.
III.4. Dynamical Decoupling
Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a method to reduce
errors arising from spectator qubits that are acted on triv-
ially by a given gate. When a qubit is idling, a set of single
qubit operations are interleaved using basis transforma-
tions so that environmental contamination or spurious sig-
nals from other qubits become decoupled. As a result the

coherence time of the quantum circuit becomes extended.
For a review of the method see Ref. [ 158]. There exist
many methods for DD [ 25,158–162] and extensive studies
on different DD sequences have been done [ 25,163–165].
It is well known the effectiveness of a given DD sequence
is problem- [166–169] and hardware-dependent [25, 163].
The time-dependent evolution can be described using a
total Hamiltonian Hthat depends on the Hamiltonian of
the ideal system HS, the Hamiltonian of the environment
HE, and the interaction between the system and the
environment HSEas
H=HS+HE+HSE. (27)
We can view HSEas an error term in the desired error-
mitigated Hamiltonian and cancel them out to some de-
gree using time-dependent inversion pulses in long periods
of system-environment interaction. These pulses can be
incorporated into a circuit via a transpiler pass, as de-
scribed below, and are available within Qiskit .
When a circuit is prepared to be run on a quantum
computer, it is first transformed into a logically equiva-
lent circuit in terms of the basis gates supported by the
quantum computer through a process called transpiling.
The DD transpiler pass [ 170] analyzes a transpiled circuit
for idle periods and inserts delay instructions. Although
this will be effective in keeping a system in phase during
single-qubit gates, CNOTs have longer gate times (10 or
more times that of a single-qubit gate) and require a DD
pulse sequence to decouple the idle qubits. Research on
CNOT-induced idle periods and the best strategies for
DD implementation is detailed in Ref. [171].
In this work, we studied three different dynami-
cal decoupling sequences: Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill
(CPMG) [ 159,160], XY4 [ 161], and Eulerian dynami-
cal decoupling (EDD) [ 162], which are described below.
These pulse sequences are shown in Fig. 11 where, τis10

the length of idle time on the qubit minus the single qubit
gate operation times.
One of the earliest described decoupling sequences was
proposed by Carr & Purcell in 1954 [ 159] and elaborated
on by Meiboom & Gill four years later [ 160]. Called
CPMG, this sequence gives first-order protection to envi-
ronmental coupling. It involves two Xpulses, symmetri-
cally placed on a spectator like in Fig. 11. While CPMG
has been shown to perform better than a system without
DD [ 25], it makes assumptions about the pulses being
ideal. In addition, CPMG can only decouple states close
to the equator of the Bloch sphere (such as the |+⟩and
|−⟩states). To protect all states universally, more than
justXpulses are needed.
Following previous work on DD sequences, Maudsley
brought forward a sequence with universal first-order
protection of states in the ideal pulse limit [ 161] by in-
troducing a Y-rotation to the CPMG sequence as seen in
Fig. 11. This additional direction of rotation cancels out
the final undesirable HSEterms. It is important to note
that to properly implement XY4, the total delay time t
must be bounded by the number of single qubit gates.
If the total CNOT time is less than the time it takes
to implement 4 single qubit gates, then XY4 cannot be
implemented. For IBM devices, this issue does not arise
because CNOT times are 10 or more times that of single
qubit gates. However, other factors such as pulse align-
ment can place restrictions on the allowed ft. Like CPMG,
XY4’s efficacy is based on an ideal pulse model and may
not accurately describe some noise sources arising on real
quantum computers.
Eulerian Dynamical Decoupling (EDD) is a class of
sequences proposed by Viola and Knill [ 162] that provides
universal first-order protection and takes into account
imperfect pulses as well. The name of this procedure is
derived from the Eulerian cycles on a Cayley graph of the
discrete group (in our case, rotational gates from which a
sequence is constructed), a formalism which is elaborated
on in Ref. [ 163]. The explicit sequence of gates we used
is described in Ref. [25] and shown in Fig. 11.
Environmental couplings can introduce both oscillatory
effects and exponential damping to the underlying signal
as discussed above. DD can mitigate these oscillatory
and exponential damping effects. It is easiest to see these
effects on the simple observables r(t) used for rescaling.
With an ideal quantum computer, the expected value ofr(t) for our studies should be 1 regardless of the circuit
depth. We show the effects of including DD on the rescal-
ing circuit in Fig. 12. If only Pauli or depolarizing noise
channels are affecting the quantum system, then this cir-
cuit should decay exponentially with depth. However we
observe that without DD environmental effects introduce
oscillatory terms which invalidate Eq. (25).
To quantify the efficacy of the different DD se-
quences, we ran simulations of the rescaling circuit on
ibmq quito and ibmq manila with CPMG, XY4, and
EDD protocols. In order to avoid over-optimizing our
choice of DD sequence, these studies used a different initial
state than the one used in our final results corresponding
to|ψ⟩=1√
2(|0⟩|+⟩|0⟩+|1⟩|−⟩| 1⟩). The results were then
fit to the ansatz
f(x) =Ae−Bxcos(Cx) +D, (28)
which is inspired by studies in Ref. [ 158]. The inclusion
of the oscillatory term is often seen when superposition
states are prepared [ 172]. When comparing the fits with
and without DD, we expect to see that the coefficients B
andCshould decrease when DD sequences are included
into the quantum simulation. We find fit coefficients for
the example case shown in Fig. 12 and in this and all
other cases it is indeed observed that DD lowers the fitted
values ofBandC. For the example shown in Fig. 12,
we find that B= 0.1356(58) and C= 0.3664(68) without
DD andB= 0.1016(18) and C=−0.0919(54) when DD
is included. Similar trends are observed with the other
simulations.
The rescaling circuits were also fit to Eq. (28) and the
resultingBvalues are shown in Figs. 13- 14 and Table II.
The results show that XY4 and EDD generally perform
better for this study than CPMG since they have a smaller
value ofB. There is a slight preference for EDD over XY4;
however there are physical hardware constraints that limit
the ability to implement EDD due to its large number of
gates. Thus XY4 was used for all further simulations.

Exact results can be obtained classically for the lattice
sizes studied in this work and are shown for comparison.
It is clear that with only randomized compiling and read-
out error mitigation, quantum simulation results deviate
significantly from their expected values for all t/ε > 1.
This demonstrates that randomized compiling is able to
transform some but far from all systematic uncertainties
into statistical uncertainties. The inclusion of DD without
rescaling improves agreement between quantum simula-
tion results and expectations for small circuit depths,
but there are still statistically significant discrepancies
visible fort/ε≳2. In particular the amplitude of the sig-
nal decays with increasing t/ε, while the expected result
described a fixed-amplitude oscillation.
This decay is effectively counteracted for some values
oft/εby including rescaling alone; however, at other
values oft/εrescaling leads to overcorrections or drives
the simulation results further away from the expected
result. The overcorrection could arise from the fact thatTABLE II. Best-fit parameters and associated goodness-of-

(b) evolution circuit observable
FIG. 14. Comparison of noisy estimates of the rescaling cir-
cuits and correlation functions using the three DD sequences
describes in the main text for an Ns= 2 lattice representing
[e0,σ0,1,p1] using qubits [3, 2, 4] on ibmq manila .
the rescaling circuit and the time evolution circuit are
not exactly the same length and the small mismatch
leads to an accumulation of error as the simulation circuit
depth increases. In addition, randomized compiling using
only Pauli matrices does not exactly map the coherent
error to a depolarizing channel. This mapping is only
true if the full Clifford group is used. Given this, the
rescaling procedure defined in Eq. (28) is not exactly
correct. Rescaling will typically fail if the observable used
for rescaling has any oscillatory components.
The simultaneous inclusion of DD and rescaling leads to
significant improvements over the use of either technique
alone. The quantum simulation results for t/ε≲10 agree
with theoretical expectations within 5% precision. Even
for largert/ε, results obtained with DD and rescaling are
much closer to theoretical expectations than unmitigated
results. These results show that the amplitude of the fully
mitigated results still leaves the expected physical range
for larget/εbut suggest that the frequency of observed os-
cillations approximately matches the expected frequency.
Similar behavior can be observed in fully mitigated quan-tum simulation results for each set of parameters m0and
Nsconsidered here, as shown in Fig. 16.
To quantify the accuracy of our simulation results with
and without QEM, we perform fits of C(t) to the spectral
representation discussed in Sec. II.3. The simplest ansatz
is the single-cosine form shown in Eq. (18), which assumes
that the initial state can be approximated as a superpo-
sition of two energy eigenstates. The largest correction
to this form arising from Trotterization is that physical
timestare equal to atNt, where the renormalized Trotter-
ization scale atis only equal to the Trotter step size t/ε
for a non-interacting theory and otherwise is a function
at(ε,m 0,η,Ns) that must be determined for a given set
of parameters by matching a dimensionful observable to
a known value through scale setting. Taking t=atNtin
Eq.(18) allows us to express the single-state fit ansatz as
C(t)≈cos(atMNt)eBt, (29)
whereeBtfactor introduces a nuisance parameter Bin or-
der to account for residual effects of depolarizing noise that
are not completely removed by rescaling. This shows that
atMis the dimensionless Fourier conjugate variable to the
number of Trotter steps Nt. Correlated χ2-minimization
fits to this functional form are used to extract atM. The
ansatz is then fit to all possible ranges of fit data with six
or more consecutive Trotter steps. We then use Bayesian
model averaging from Ref. [ 173] to determine the time
dependent mass and associated systematic and statistical
uncertainties. If these results described a physically rele-
vant lattice gauge theory, we could match observables like
atMto their experimental values in order to determine
atand therefore make unambiguous predictions for other
energies in physical units. For the 1+1 dimensional model
at hand,atMprovides a proof-of-principle demonstration
of the calculation of an observable that could be used for
scale setting and is the final result of this work.
Results for atMobtained from fitting our quantum
simulation results at each m0andNsstudied are shown
in Table III. The theoretically expected exact results
(atM)expected computed classically are shown for compari-
son in the same table, and 1 σagreement between quantum
simulation results and these expectations is found in the
asm0= 1 cases. However, significant discrepancies are
found in the asm0= 2 cases. These discrepancies may
arise from couplings to other excited states whose ex-
act energies are close to the ones extracted from fits to
our quantum simulations. It is noteworthy that apply-
ing QEM methods, and in particular the combination of
rescaling and DD, is found to be necessary for achieving a
good fit to Eq. (29). Performing analogous fits to results
without either of these techniques leads to less accurate
estimates of the mass gap with larger uncertainties.
The effect of QEM can also be studied in Fourier space
by calculating the discrete Fourier transform (DFT.

The squared magnitude |f(atω)|2for them0= 2 and
Ns= 4 (7 qubit lattice) correlation functions with and
without DD and rescaling are shown in Fig. 17. In a noise-
less simulation, a clear peak around atω≈(atM)expected
should be visible that would approach a δ-function as
Nt→∞ . While the simulation without DD and rescaling
shows an apparent peak close to this value, it is statisti-
cally not significant at 1.3 σ. Including DD and rescaling
leads to a drastic decrease in relative uncertainty in fre-
quency space and the peak close to ( atM)expected is clearly
visible at 6.4 σ. The frequencies atωassociated with these
peaks in the Fourier spectrum correspond to energy gaps
(relative to the vacuum) for states that have significant
overlap with the state studied here. As expected from the
success of single-cosine fits to correlation functions in the
time domain, the location of the statistically significant
peak visible in mitigated results is consistent with the
fitted values of atMin Table III and with ( atM)exact.
The remaining spurious oscillations in the simulation in-
cluding all error mitigation techniques could arise from
correlations between different frequency DFTs and possi-
ble ringing artifacts due to the finite number of Trottersteps.
To measure the efficacy of QEM, we use a figure of merit
that quantifies how much longer a mitigated circuit can
be simulated over an unmitigated one. This definition
uses the relative deviation δM
λ(t) of a simulation with
parameters λ={m0,Ns,ϵ,device}at a timet/εfrom
the noiseless exact value with a mitigation strategy M:
δM
λ(t) =/radicaltp/radicalvertex/radicalvertex/radicalbt/summationtextt
ti=0[Cexact(ti)−CM(ti)]2
/summationtextt
ti=0Cexact(ti)2,(31)
We then define tM
λ(∆) as the first trotter step t/εsuch
thatδM
λ(t) is larger than a threshold ∆. An improvement
factor from mitigation can then be defined as
Tλ(∆) =tM
λ(∆)

λ(∆)(32)
whereM=0corresponds to the unmitigated or only
randomly compiled cases that we use as baselines. This
is similar to the relative error mitigation metric proposed
in Refs. [ 174,175]. For three of our parameter sets, we
haveM=0results available for comparison. We find
that 1≤Tλ(∆)≤20 for 0≤∆≤1 withTmonotonically
increasing with ∆ — here ∆ ≲0.2 trivially shows no signs
of improvement becuase tM
λ(∆) is equal to 1 for all M,
while the maximum value of Tλachieved corresponds to
the number of Trotter steps Nt. Finally, to compute a
single value, we average over a wide range of reasonable
choices ∆ = d/25 withd∈{1,..., 25}as

V. CONCLUSIONS
Quantum simulations offer promising methods for com-
puting the non-equilibrium responses of strongly-coupled
quantum systems to applied currents. In high-energy
physics, such responses can be used to predict observ-
ables ranging from transport coefficients to scattering
cross sections [ 65]. Predictions for these non-equilibrium
observables require calculations of Minkowski correlation
functions including the time-evolution operator U(t). In
this work, we computed a simple two-point Minkowski
correlation function in 1 + 1 dZ2gauge theory in order tostudy how such observables might be determined using
quantum simulations. After combining several quantum
error mitigation strategies, we obtained an accurate de-
scription of the time dependence of the correlation func-
tion and thereby the energy of the lowest-lying spin-1
state. These QEM strategies were essential for extracting
accurate predictions from the NISQ-era quantum hard-
ware used here.
During our studies, we found interesting synergies be-
tween various QEM techniques. Randomized compiling
allows some hardware-level stochastic systematic errors
to be converted to quantifiable statistical uncertainties,
but quantum simulation results using only this technique
still differ significantly from exact results. Rescaling can
be used to remove exponential signal decay with respect
to circuit depth but requires a noise model that correctly
describes the remaining systematics. We find that a sim-15

ple noise model including only a depolarizing channel
does not adequately describe our simulation results when
only randomized compiling and readout error correction
are employed. However, this simple noise model satisfac-
torily describes our results when dynamic decoupling isincluded. Leveraging all of these error mitigation strate-
gies together, we extend the range of simulation times
over which accurate results are achieved by a factor of 6
in comparison to results using only randomized compiling
and readout error correction.
Extending these simulations to realistic LGTs in four
dimensions will require further theoretical and algorithmic
developments. The simplicity of 1 + 1 dZ2gauge theory
allowed us to construct initial states that predominantly
overlap with a small number of energy eigenstates. Con-
structing such initial states will be increasingly difficult
to achieve for more complex theories and in higher dimen-
sions, and a variety of methods for efficient initial-state
preparation are under active investigation [ 52,67–73,176–
200]
Trotterization errors were not found to be numerically
significant for the range of times used in this analysis, but
these issues are also likely to be more challenging in more
complex simulations. One promising avenue for address-
ing these errors is the construction of improved Hamilto-
nians [ 46,177] along the lines of the Symanzik improve-
ment program used in classical LGT simulations [ 201].
Finally, it is anticipated that the efficacy of particular
error mitigation strategies will change dramatically for
larger gauge groups and nonabelian gauge theories where
the gauge and fermion registers themselves require mul-
tiple qubits. For these cases, additional QEM methods
such as those discussed in Refs. [ 54,64] may be important
to include. Although NISQ-era quantum computers are
not large enough for phenomenologically relevant lattice-
QCD simulations, it is crucial to develop QEM strategies
and identify best practices for Hamiltonian simulations
of lattice gauge theories so that the community is ready
to efficiently and effectively utilize large-scale quantum
computers when they become available.
