In this work, we study the three-dimensional AdS gravitatio nal vacuum stars (gravastars) in the
context of gravity’s rainbow theory. Then we extend it by add ing the Maxwell electromagnetic ﬁeld.
We compute the physical features of gravastars, such as prop er length, energy, entropy, and junction
conditions. Our results show that the physical parameters f or charged and uncharged states depend
signiﬁcantly on rainbow functions. Besides from charged st ate, they also depend on the electric
ﬁeld. Finally, we explore the stability of thin shell of thre e-dimensional (un)charged AdS gravastars
in gravity’s rainbow. We show that the structure of thin shel l of these gravastars may be stable and
is independent of the type of matter.
I. INTRODUCTION
Mazur and Motola ﬁrst proposed the notion of a gravitationalvacu um star (gravastar)as an alternative to the black
hole [1, 2]. In other words, gravastars are free of any kind of singu larity. The gravastar consists of three regions as
follows [3–12]. The interior region (0 < r < r 1) has a vacuum explain by the dark energy, with equation of state (E OS)
p=−ρ. Shell region ( r1< r < r 2) consists of ultra-stiﬀ perfect ﬂuid with EoS p=ρthat ﬁrst reported, by Zeldovich
and Novikov in context of cosmology [13, 14]. The exterior region ( r > r2) is a vacuum region with EOS p= 0
which can be described by Schwarzschild, Kerr and Kerr-Neumann, Reissner-Nordstr¨ om metrics as requested under
the situation. Commonly described the Schwarzschild [15, 16] and Re issner-Nordstr¨ om metric [17, 18] depending the
gravastar is charged and rotating or not.
In 1992, B˜ anados, Teitelboim, and Zanelli proposed a new black hole solution by considering three-dimensional
gravity with negative cosmological constant [19]. The existence of s uch black holes, generally called BTZ black holes.
Also, in subsequent works [20, 21], the three-dimensional black hole s were seriously investigated, particularly in the
context of the anti-de Sitter (AdS)/conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT ) correspondence (or AdS/CFT correspondence) [22].
Indeed the study of BTZ black holes is beneﬁcial to comprehension g ravitational interactions in low-dimensional
spacetime [23]. In this regard, some interesting works on three-dim ensional black holes have been perused in Refs.
[24–30].
Notably, when faced with the computational and conceptual challe nges of quantum gravity, one is compelled to
ﬁnd simple models to overcome these signiﬁcant challenges; ideally, on es that preserve some of the original conceptual
complexities while simplifying the computational eﬀort. An example of s uch a model is general relativity (GR)
in2+1−dimensions. Spacetime geometry in 2+1−dimensions shares many fundamental issues with theories in
3+1−dimensions,whichisanexcellentlaboratoryformanytheoreticalap proaches. Inaddition,fundamentalphysics,
especially ﬁeld theories in 2+1−dimensions such as quantum hall eﬀect, cosmic topology, parity viola tion, cosmic
strings, and induced masses enjoy curious properties which invite d edicated studies [31–38]. On the other hand, it
has been shown that the classical black holes (such as BTZ black hole s) cannot exist in de Sitter spacetime [39]. So,
we consider the AdS case for gravastars in 2+1−dimensional spacetime.
Magueijo and Smolin [40] obtained the gravity’s rainbow which is the gen eralization of doubly special relativity
for curved spacetimes. The gravity’s rainbow produces a rectiﬁca tion to the spacetime that becomes substantial as
soon as the particle’s energy-momentum approaches the Planck en ergy. So that in this formalism, connectivity and
curvature arerelated to the energy. In fact, in the gravity’srain bow, the gravitationaleﬀects, in addition toas well as a
possible explanation for the absence of black holes at the LHC creat ing curvature in spacetime, create diﬀerent eﬀects
those are proportional to diﬀerent wavelengths in the structure of spacetime. Thus gravity’s rainbow is a falsiﬁcation

of spacetime deﬁned by two arbitrary functions L(ε) andH(ε) (they are called the rainbow functions). This theory
could provide a solution for information paradox [41, 42], the existen ce of remains for black holes after vaporization
[43], as well as a possible explanation for the absence of black holes at the LHC [44]. In astrophysical point of view,
it has been shown that the maximum mass of neutron stars can be mo re than three times the mass of Sun [45, 46].
Indeed the mass of neutron stars is an increasing function of rainb ow functions [45–47]. In the context of gravity,
it has been pointed out that by considering appropriate scaling for t he energy functions, the Horava-Lifshitz gravity
can be related to the gravity’s rainbow [48]. In the context of black h oles, various studies focusing on the eﬀects of
gravity’s rainbow on the thermodynamics of black holes have been ma de in Refs. [49–54]. Also, it has been shown
that the second law of thermodynamics and cosmic censorship surm ise are refracted owing to the rainbow eﬀect [55].
The rainbow functions have a very considerable eﬀect on the inform ation ﬂux of black holes [56]. Alencar et al. [57],
studied the inﬂuence of gravity’s rainbow on the global Casimir eﬀect around a static small black hole at zero and
the ﬁnite temperature. In addition, combination of gravity’s rainbo w with modiﬁed theories of gravity such as F(R)
andF(T) theories [58–61], Rastall gravity [62], massive gravity [63], dilaton g ravity [64], have been also made. In the
context of cosmology, attention of gravity’s rainbow could dispel t he big bang singularity [65–67]. In addition, the
primary singularity problem [68] and stability of Einstein’s static univer se in gravity’s rainbow have been investigated
[69].
In order to detect a non-singular replaced to BTZ black holes, it is ne cessary to explore gravastars in three-
dimensional spacetime. Usmani et al. [70] have presented a new mod el of a gravastar admitting conformal motion
which includes a charged interior for four-dimensional spacetime. T heir exterior has been discussed by a Reissner-
Nordstr¨ om line element instead of Schwarzschild one. The gravast ar model in higher dimensional spacetime deﬁned
in Refs. [18, 71, 72]. Later Rahaman et al. [73] have designed an unch arged gravastar in three-dimensional AdS
spacetime. The exterior region of this gravastar corresponds to the outer three-dimensional AdS spacetime of BTZ
black holes. Then, they extended the gravastar in three-dimensio nal AdS spacetime by adding the electrical charge
[74]. Other works on the (un)charged gravastarmodels with their p hysical features have been studied in Refs. [75–87].
Also, many gravastars have been studied in the framework of modiﬁ ed theories of gravity. For example, the gravastar
solution in the f(R,T) gravity model has been evaluated in Refs. [88–90]. The gravastar solution in f(G,T) gravity
model has been analyzed in [91]. The structure of a gravastar adm itting conformal motion for a speciﬁc model of
energy-momentum squared gravity has been studied in Ref. [92]. Is otropic static spherically symmetric uncharged
gravastars under the framework of braneworld gravity by using t he metric potential of Kuchowicz type have been
found in Ref. [93]. Ghosh et al. [94] extracted the gravastar solutio ns in Rastall gravity. Considering F(R,G)
theory of gravity, the gravastar model has been evaluated in Ref . [95]. Debnath has discussed the geometry of the
four-dimensional charged gravastar model in Rastall-gravity’s ra inbow [96].
The basic motivation of the work is to study the gravastar in three- dimensional AdS spacetime, both charged and
uncharged states, in the context of gravity’s rainbow theory with the isotropic ﬂuid. Also, we research the nature
of physical parameters and study the stability of thin-shell grava stars for three-dimensional (un)charged AdS in this
theory of gravity. In this regard, the general formalism of gravit y’s rainbow by using the deformation of the standard
energy-momentum relation, could be obtained

whereε=E
Ep. Herep,E,µandEp=/radicalig

Gare the momentum, energy, mass of a test particle and Planck ener gy,
respectively. Also, L(ε) andH(ε) are called the rainbow functions. It is signiﬁcant that there are th ree known cases
for the rainbow function;
•The ﬁrst is related to the hard spectra caused gamma-ray bursts [97], with the form
L(ε) =eβε−1
βε&H(ε) = 1. (2)
•The second set of rainbow functions comes from considering the co nstancy of the velocity of light [98],
L(ε) =H(ε) =1
1−λε. (3)
•The third is motivated by studying the conducted in loop quantum gra vity and noncommutative geometry as
[99, 100]
L(ε) = 1 & H(ε) =/radicalbig
1−ηεn, (4)3
whereβ,λ,ηandnare constants those can be adjusted by experiment. It is notable that at low energy levels,
the rainbow functions satisfy the following relations,
lim
ε−→0L(ε) = 1 & lim
ε−→0H(ε) = 1. (5)
The following recipe can be used to build an energy dependent spacet ime,
/hatwideg(ε) =ηabea(ε)⊗eb(ε), (6)
wheree0(ε) =1
L(ε)/tildewidee0andei(ε) =1
H(ε)/tildewideei. Also,/tildewidee0and/tildewideeibeing the energy independent frame ﬁelds. Considering Eq.
(6), we obtain a three-dimensional spacetime describing the interio r spacetime of a compact object model in gravity’s
rainbow as
ds2=f(r)
L2(ε)dt2−1
H2(ε)/parenleftbiggdr2
g(r)+r2dθ2/parenrightbigg
, (7)
wheref(r) andg(r) are functions of r. Also,L(ε) andH(ε) depend on ε=E/Ep. By considering that the metric
coeﬃcients are dependent on the energy of the test particle, the spacetime geometry becomes energy dependent.
The structure of present work is as follows; In section II, we deal with the geometry of uncharged gravastar, and
also we calculate the solutions in the three regions of gravastar. Als o in this section, we analyze the physical aspects
of the gravastar model parametersl. Section III studies the geo metry of the charged gravastar, where the solutions of
the all regions of the charged gravastar are calculated. Then we e xamine the physical aspects of the parameters of
charged gravastar model. Section IV investigates the matching of thin shell gravastars’ interior and exterior regions
for three-dimensional uncharged and charged AdS in gravity’s rain bow. In section IVB we study the stability of thin
shell gravastars. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in section V.
II. THREE-DIMENSIONAL UNCHARGED GRAVASTARS IN GRAVITY’S R AINBOW
In this section, we obtain the solutions of ﬁeld equations for gravas tar in gravity’s rainbow without electromagnetic
ﬁeld, and analyze its geometrical as well as physical interpretation s. As it was mentioned in previous section, there
are three regions of the gravastar structured as follows; (i) inte rior region R1: 0< r < r 1with the equation of state
(EOS) follows p=−ρ, (ii) shell region R2:r1< r < r 2with EOS follows p=ρ, (iii) exterior region R3:r2< rwith
EOS follows p=ρ= 0.
The ﬁeld equation with the energy-dependent cosmological consta nt Λ(ε) and perfect ﬂuid distribution in gravity’s
rainbow is as follows
Rαβ−1
2Rgαβ+Λ(ε)gαβ=−8π/parenleftbig
TPF
αβ/parenrightbig
, (8)
whereRrefers to the Ricci scalar, Λ( ε) is the cosmological constant which depends on ε, andRαβis the Ricci tensor.
Here, we consider the matter distribution in the interior of a compac t object as a perfect ﬂuid model given by
TPF
αβ= (ρ+p)uαuβ−pgαβ, (9)
wherep,ρ,uαare the ﬂuid pressure, matter-energy density and velocity three -vector of a ﬂuid element, respectively.
The Einstein’s ﬁeld equations with a negative energy-dependent cos mological constant (Λ( ε)<0), for the spacetime
explained by Eq. (7) with the energy-momentum tensor described in Eq. (9), yield (rendering G=c= 1)
H2(ε)g′(r)
2r= 8πρ(r)+Λ(ε), (10)

4f(r)+H2(ε)g(r)f′′(r)
2f(r)=−8πp(r)+Λ(ε). (12)
where the prime and double prime deﬁne the ﬁrst and second derivat ives with respect to r, respectively. Now, the
generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equation can be writ ten as
p′+(p+ρ)f′
2f= 0. (13)4
A. Interior region of gravastar
The interior region R1(0< r < r 1=D) of the gravastar follows EoS p=−ρ. We advert that this type of EoS is
available in the works and is known as a degenerate vacuum, false vac uum, or ρ-vacuum [101–104] and represents a
repellent pressure. Therefore by using the result given in Eq. (13) , we can obtain the following interior
ρ=constant =ρv. (14)
Here we deﬁne this constant as ρv=H2
0/2π[73], where H0refers to the Hubble parameter. In other word, it can
be described as follows,
p=−ρv. (15)
Now, by using Eqs. (10) and (11), we get the solutions for g(r) andf(r) from the ﬁeld equations as,
g(r) =f(r) =A+/parenleftbig
Λ(ε)+4H2

whereAis an integration constant. From the above equation, it can be seen that the obtained metric is free from
any central singularity. So, the active gravitational mass M(r) can be expressed at in the following form
M(r) =/integraldisplayD
02πrρdr=H2
0D2
2. (17)
Here, it is observed that for the interior region, the physical para meters such as pressure, density and gravitational
mass, do not depend on the rainbow functions. We also note that th e quantities g(r) andf(r) depend on the rainbow
function H(ε).
B. Exterior region of gravastar
For the vacuum exterior region, EoS is given by p=ρ= 0. The solution corresponds to the static BTZ black hole
in gravity’s rainbow is written as follows [105, 106],
f(r) =g(r) =−m0−Λ(ε)r2
H2(ε), (18)
where the parameter m0is an integration constant related to the total mass of black hole.
C. Sell of gravastar
Here we study a thin shell including ultra-relativisticﬂuid ofsoft quan ta obeyingEoS as p=ρ. This assumption has
already been used by various authors, which is known as a stiﬀ ﬂuid th at refers to a Zeldovich Universe to investigate
some cosmological [107–109] and astrophysical phenomena and as trophysical events [110–112]. It is not simple to
solve the ﬁeld equations within the non-vacuum region R2, i.e., within the shell. However, we can obtain an analytic
solution within the framework of very thin shell limit, 0 < g(r)≡h <<1. The reason of using this very thin shell
limit is that in this limit, it can be set hto be zero to the ﬁrst order. Therefore, the ﬁeld equations (10- 12), with
p=ρ, can be written as,
h′=4rΛ(ε)
H2(ε). (19)
Integrating Eq. (19) yields
h=g(r) =B+2Λ(ε)r2
H2(ε). (20)

whereB, andC1are integration constants. It is notable that C2is a constant with a dimension as (length)−2that is

1. Proper Length
We note that the radius of inter boundary of shell is r1=Dand the radius of the exterior boundary of shell is
r2=D+δ, whereδis the proper thickness of shell which is considered to be very small ( i.e.,δ <<1). The proper
length of shell is described as l=/integraltextD+δ

in gravity’s rainbow, which is given by
l=/integraldisplayD+δ
D/radicaligg

H2(ε)g(r)dr. (24)
Sinceg(r) is complicated in the shell region, it is not simple to obtain the analytica l form of above integral. Here
we assume/radicalig

g(r)=dF(r)

Sinceδ <<1 (O(δ2)≈0), according to the above manipulation, it can be considered only th e ﬁrst-order term of δ.
So for this approximation, the proper length will be equal to
l≈δ
H(ε)/radicaligg

B+2Λ(ε)D2
H2(ε). (26)
From the above result, we understand that the proper length of t hin shell of the gravastar is proportional to the
thickness ( δ) of shell. Also it is observed that the proper length of thin shell depe nds on the rainbow function H(ε).

3. Entropy
Mazur and Mottola [1, 2] showed that the entropy density is zero in the interior region R1of the gravastar. But,
the entropy within the thin shell in gravity’s rainbow can be expresse d by

Here we have plotted the physical parameters, the proper length l, the energy E, and the entropy Sversus the
rainbow function ( H(ε)) in Figs. 1-3, respectively. From these ﬁgures, we see that all th ree parameters of the shell of
gravastar decrease versus the rainbow function H(ε).7

Now, we analyze the solutions of ﬁeld equations for charged gravas tar (here, charge is created by electromagnetic
ﬁeld) and discuss its geometry as well as physical interpretations.
A. Interior region of charged gravastar
In search for interior solution which is free of any mass-singularity a t the origin, our conﬁguration is supported by
an interior region R1(0< r < r 1=D) of the charged gravastar with equation of state p=−ρ. Hence by using the
result given in Eqs. (40) and (43), we obtain the following interior,

A characteristic feature of a stellar compact object is that the int ernal gravitational mass and radius of the star
system are directly proportional to each other, which is shown by E q. (52). Here, it can be also observed via Eq. (48)
thatthephysicalparameterssuchaspressureanddensityared ependentonthecharge. However,inthisconnection, we
note an interesting point; the mentioned physical parameters are not dependent on the energy-dependent cosmological
constant Λ( ε) and rainbow functions for the interior region. We also observe tha t the quantities g(r),f(r),M(r),
andσ(r) depend not only on the rainbow function H(ε), but also on the charge.
B. Exterior region of charged gravastar
In order to discuss the exterior region of charged gravastar who se EoS is given by p=ρ= 0, we take the solution
corresponds to a static charged BTZ black hole in the gravity’s rainb ow described as follows [114],
f(r) =g(r) =−m0−Λ(ε)r2
H2(ε)−2q2L2(ε)
l2ln/parenleftigr
l/parenrightig
, (53)
where the parameter qis an integration constant referred to the total charge of the bla ck hole. Furthermore, lis a
constant with the length dimension that is considered for the sake o f having a dimensionless logarithmic argument.
Forq= 0, the above metric reaches to the uncharged BTZ black hole in gra vity’s rainbow.
C. Sell of charged gravastar
In the shell region, it is assumed that the thin shell region contains s tiﬀ perfect ﬂuid which follows EoS p=ρ. For
this EoS, it is complex to get to the answer the solution from the ﬁeld e quations. Similar to the uncharged case, we
shall consider the limit 0 < g(r)≡h <<1 in the thin shell to obtain the analytical solution within the thin shell.
Assuming this approximation ( hto be zero) with p=ρ, the ﬁeld equations (40)-(42), can be recast in the following
forms,
h′=4r(Λ(ε)+E2)
H2(ε), (54)
H2(ε)h′f′(r)
4f(r)=−2E2. (55)
By integrating Eq. (54), we get
g(r) =A0+2Λ(ε)r2
H2(ε)+32π2σ2
0r2m+4
H2(ε)(m+2)3, (56)
whereA0is an integrating constant. Using this value in Eq. (55), it is obtained a nother metric coeﬃcient as,
f(r) =F0/parenleftigg
Λ(ε)+16π2σ2

whereF0is an integration constant. Also, using the generalized TOV equation (43) one can get

m/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg
Λ(ε)+16π2σ2

the equation (58) shows that the energy-dependentcosmologica lconstanthas a important contribution to the pressure
and density parameters of the shell of charged gravastar in an ad ditive manner.10

to the previous case (uncharged case), and by assuming/radicalig

Fromtheaboveresult, weunderstandthat theproperlength oft hethin shellofthechargedgravastarisproportional
to the shell’s thickness δ. Also it is observed that the proper length of thin shell of the charg ed gravastar depends on
the electric ﬁeld σ0, the radius D, the rainbow function H(ε), the energy-dependent cosmological constant Λ( ε), and
alsom. The proper length lhave been plotted versus thickness δand radius Din Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. In Fig.
4, it can be seen a linear relationship between proper length and thick ness of the shell. Also from Fig. 5, we see that
the proper length ldecreases as radius Dincreases.
2. Energy
The energy content within the shell region of the charged gravast ar is deﬁned in the following form [74],
E=/integraldisplayD+δ

We use Eq. (61), to calculate the energy content within the thin she ll region of the charged gravastar in gravity’s11

H(ε) = 1.1.

We observe that the energy content in the shell region is proportio nal to the thickness δof the shell. In addition,
we see that the energy of charged gravastar depends on the elec tric ﬁeld σ0of gravastar, the radius D, the rainbow
function H(ε), the energy-dependent cosmological constant Λ( ε), and also m. We have plotted the energy content E
in the shell versus thickness δand radius Din Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. As one can see the energy content Ein
the shell increases with the thickness δof shell of the charged gravastar (Fig. 6) as well as the radius D(Fig. 7).12
FIG. 7: The energy Evs radius D. We have chosen σ0= 1,δ= 0.01,A0= 1, Λ(ε) =−1,m= 2 and H(ε) = 1.1.

in three-dimensional energy-dependent spacetime is proportiona l to the thickness δof the shell, the electric ﬁeld σ0,
the radius D, the rainbow function H(ε), the energy-dependent cosmological constant Λ( ε), andm. We have drawn
the entropy Swithin the shell versus the thickness δand radius Din Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. The entropy S
increases when the thickness δand the radius Dincrease.
IV. JUNCTION CONDITION BETWEEN INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR REGIO NS
According to this fact that gravastar consists of three regions, interior region, thin shell region, and exterior region,
using the Darmois-Israel formalism [115–117], one can study the ma tching between the surfaces of the interior and
exterior regions. For this purpose, we deﬁne Σ as the junction sur face located at r=D. In the gravity’s rainbow,
the metric 7 considered on the junction surface. It appears that the metric coeﬃcients at the junction surface Σ are
continuous, but their derivatives might not be continuous at Σ. Usin g the extrinsic curvature of Σ at r=D, in the
joining surface S, it is possible to determine the surface stress-energy and surfac e tension of the junction surface S.
According to the Lanczos equation [118], stress-energy surface Sijis deﬁned as follows,
Sij=−1
8π(ηij−δijηkk). (67)13
FIG. 8: The entropy Svs thickness δ. We have chosen σ0= 4,D= 1,A0= 1, Λ(ε) =−1,m= 2 and H(ε) = 1.1.
FIG. 9: The entropy Svs radius D. We have chosen σ0= 4,δ= 0.01,A0= 1, Λ(ε) =−1,m= 1 and H(ε) = 1.1.
Then, the discontinuity in the second fundamental form is express ed as follows,
ηij=K+
ij−K−
ij, (68)
whereKijdescribes the extrinsic curvature. The signs ” −”and ”+” are related to the gravastar’sinterior and exterior
regions, respectively. The components of the extrinsic curvatur e tensor on both surfaces of the shell region read

Now, from Lanczos equation spacetime, the stress-energy surf ace tensor can be written as Sij=diag(̺,P), where ̺
is the surface energy density and Pis the surface pressure, respectively. So according to the gener al formalism for
three-dimensional spacetime [119] and using the above equations, and also by setting r=D, for uncharged gravastars,14
FIG. 10: The line energy density ̺uncharged vs radius D. We have chosen m0=−80,H0= 70,A= 1, Λ(ε) =−1,

It is notable that ̺uncharged andPuncharged are related to the line energy density and line pressure of uncharge d
gravastar in gravity’s rainbow, respectively. Also, ̺chargedandPcharged, are related to the line energy density and
the line pressure of charged gravastar in this gravity, respective ly. We have drawn our results for the line energy
density and line pressure versus radius Dfor both state of charged and uncharged in Figs. 10-13. It is clear that the
line energy density for both state of charged and uncharged grav astars increases (see Figs. 10 and 12). But the line
pressure for both state of charged and uncharged gravastars decreases as radius Dincreases (see Figs. 11 and 13).
A. Equation of State of thin-Shell gravastars in gravity’s r ainbow
The equation of state parameter ω(r) (atr=D) is described as follows
ω(D) =P(D)
̺(D).(77)15
FIG. 11: The line pressure Puncharged vs radius D. We have chosen m0=−80,H0= 70,A= 1, Λ(ε) =−1, and

FIG. 12: The line energy density ̺chargedvs radius D. We have chosen m0=−80,L(ε) = 1.1,H(ε) = 1.1,σ0= 4,
C0= 1, Λ(ε) =−1,m= 1,q= 1, and l= 1.
FIG. 13: The line pressure Pchargedvs radius D. We have chosen m0=−80,L(ε) = 1.1,H(ε) = 1.1,σ0= 4,C0= 1,

FIG. 14: ωuncharged vs radius D. We have chosen m0=−4,H0= 70,A= 1, Λ(ε) =−1, andH(ε) = 1.1.

Therefore, using equations for line energy density and line pressur e, we can obtain the equation of state parameter in
the following form,

plotted the equation of state parameters ωuncharged , andωchargedvs radius Din Fig. 14 and Fig. 15, respectively.
From these ﬁgures, we see that the equation of state parameter increase as the radius increases, but it keeps a negative
sign for both charged and uncharged states.17

B. Stability of thin-Shell gravastars in gravity’s rainbow
In this section, we want to study the stability of thin-shell gravast ars for three-dimensional uncharged and charged
AdS in gravity’s rainbow. The stable and unstable formations of thin- shell gravastars can be analyzed through the
behavior of ηas an eﬀective parameter in determining the stability regions of the r espective solutions that deﬁned as
follows [120],
η(r) =P′(r)
̺′(r).
The parameter ηcan be interpreted as the squared speed of sound satisfying 0 ≤η≤1 commonly. It is obvious that
the speed of sound should not exceed the speed of light. But, to ch eck the stability of the gravastar, this limitation
may not be satisﬁed on the surface layer [121, 122]. The parameter ηfor uncharged gravastarin r=Dcan be written
in the following form,
ηuncharged (D) =−Λ(ε)2D2

Therefore, we analyze the stability of gravastar conﬁgurations b y analyzing the sign of the parameter η. Because the
expression is complicated, we use the graphical behavior of ηuncharged (D) in Fig. 16. In this ﬁgure, we examine that
thin-shell of three-dimensional uncharged gravastars in gravity ’s rainbow expresses stable behavior for very values of
D. We obtain the parameter ηfor charged garavastars in the following form

V. CONCLUSION
Infact,thegravastaristheshortformofGravitationallyvacuum starswhichhasgivenanewideainthegravitational
system. Such a stellar model which is free from any singularity, can b e considered an alternative to black holes.
Gravastar can be described through the interior region, thin shell region, and exterior region. In this paper, we
studied the gravastars in the contexts of both three-dimensiona l AdS spacetime and gravity’s rainbow theory. We
discussed the geometry of the uncharged gravastar model in gra vity’s rainbow. In the interior region, the gravastar
followsthe equationofstate (EoS) p=−ρ. Some physicalquantitiessuch asenergydensity, pressureand g ravitational
mass were obtained for the interior region. In the exterior region, we found the vacuum exterior region whose EoS
is given by p=ρ= 0. The solution corresponds to a static BTZ black hole in the gravity ’s rainbow. In the shell
region, the ﬂuid source follows the EoS p=ρ. In this region, we considered the thickness the shell of the grava star to
be very small, because we assumed that the interior and exterior re gions join together at a location. Employing the
approximation 0 < g(r)≡h <<1, we found the analytical solutions within the thin shell of the uncha rged gravastar.
Next, we calculated the physical parameters such as the proper le ngth of the thin shell, energy, and entropy inside
the thin shell of the uncharged gravastar, and showed that thes e parameters are directly proportional to the proper
thickness of the shell ( δ) due to the approximation δ <<1. Also, we investigated the physical parameters such as
the proper length l, the energy E, and the entropy Sversus the rainbow function H(ε). Here, we saw that all three
parameters of the shell of the uncharged gravastar decreasing function of rainbow function H(ε). In the next section,
While considering a new model of charged gravastar in connection to the electrovacuum exterior three-dimensional
AdS spacetime in the context of gravity’s rainbow theory, we invest igated the role of electromagnetic ﬁeld on an
isotropic stellar model. To do this, we ﬁrst wrote the Einstein-Maxwe ll’s ﬁeld equations in the framework of the
gravity’s rainbow. Then, we obtained the geometry of charged gra vastar model. Some physical quantities such as
energy density, pressure and gravitational mass were obtained f or the interior region. In the exterior region, we found
the electrovacuum exterior region. Solution corresponds to a sta tic, charged BTZ black hole in the gravity’s rainbow.
In the shell region, under approximation 0 < g(r)≡h <<1, we obtained the analytical solutions within the thin
shell of the charged gravastar. We computed the physical param eters such as the proper length of the thin shell,
energy, and entropy inside the thin shell of the charged gravasta r, and showed that these parameters are directly
proportional to the proper thickness of the shell ( δ) due to the approximation δ <<1. These physical parameters19
signiﬁcantly depend on the rainbow function H(ε). From the results of calculations, we saw that the proper length
of the shell, energy, and entropy inside the shell of the charged gr avastar increase as thickness increases. Also, the
proper length decreases as the radius increases. The energy and entropy inside the shell always increase as the radius
increases. Besides, by using the Darmois-Israel formalism, the ma tching between the surfaces of interior and exterior
regions of the gravastars were studied. According to the matchin g conditions, the line energy density and the line
pressure were obtained for both charged and uncharged states . Our results show that the line density increase as the
radius increases, but the line pressure always decreases as the ra dius increases, but keeps the negative sign for both
charged and uncharged states. Also, the equation of state para meter on the surface was obtained which shows that
the equation of state parameter increase by increasing the radius . Here we saw that there is a negative sign for both
charged and uncharged states. Finally, we explored the stable reg ions of uncharged and charged gravastar in gravity’s
rainbow.
