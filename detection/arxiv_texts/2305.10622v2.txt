Here we study the impact of non-Markovian evolution on prominent characteristics of quantum thermody-
namics, such as ergotropy and power. These are benchmarked by the behavior of the quantum speed limit time.
We make use of both geometric-based, particularly quantum Fisher and Wigner-Yanase information metric,
and physical properties based-measures, particularly relative purity measure and relative entropy of coherence
measure, to compute the quantum speed limit time. A simple non-Markovian model of a qubit in a bosonic
bath exhibiting non-Markovian amplitude damping evolution is considered, which, from the quantum thermo-
dynamic perspective with finite initial ergotropy, can be envisaged as a quantum battery. To this end, we explore
the connections between the physical properties-based measures of quantum speed limit time and the coher-
ent component of ergotropy. The non-Markovian evolution is shown to impact the recharging process of the
quantum battery. Further, a connection between the discharging-charging cycle of the quantum battery and the
geometric measures of quantum speed limit time is observed.

I. INTRODUCTION
A realistic quantum system is subjected to the influence of
the environment. The dynamics of the system is altered by
this, and as a consequence, information is lost from the sys-
tem to the external environment. A paradigm for examining
how the ambient environment a ffects a quantum system is pro-
vided by the theory of open quantum systems (OQS) [1–3].
Ideas pertaining to open quantum systems are applicable to
a number of scenarios [4–19]. A Markovian approximation,
which implies that the environment instantly recovers from its
contact with the system, can be used to describe the evolu-
tion of an OQS in many situations. This results in a constant
movement of information from the system to the environment.
However, research has been pushed into domains beyond the
Markovian evolution due to increasing technical and techno-
logical advancements. In many of these situations, a clean
division between system and environment time scales can-
not be anticipated, leading to non-Markovian behavior [20–
38]. Non-Markovian behavior, such as that caused by strong
system-bath coupling, can delay decay and sometimes even
cause a rebirth of quantum e ffects [34, 39, 40]. The dynamics
of quantum speed limit time, introduced below, can demon-
strate how the evolution of the system of interest might alter
owing to the nature of the bath [41, 42].
One of the cornerstones of quantum physics is Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle for position
and momentum demonstrates that it is impossible to measure
both position and momentum at the same time accurately;
however, the meaning of the energy-time uncertainty relation
in this statement is not immediately clear. The energy-time
uncertainty principle ( ∆t≥ℏ/∆E) is a statement about the in-
trinsic time in which a quantum system develops, as demon-
strated by Mandelstam and Tamm (MT) in [43]. Using the
Fubini-Study metric on the space of quantum pure states, the
∗devvrat.1@iitj.ac.in
†subhashish@iitj.ac.inconcept of the quantum speed limit (QSL) time, or the speed
at which a quantum system can evolve, was first presented
in [44]. Margolus and Levitin (ML) [45] gave a di fferent
QSL time depending on the mean energy. Combining the MT
and ML bounds results in a tighter QSL time for unitary dy-
namics, limited to orthogonal pure states. QSL time alludes
to the shortest period of time needed for a quantum system
to evolve from one state to another. It plays a crucial role
in the development of quantum technologies such as quan-
tum computing and quantum communication. Over the years,
many measures to quantify the QSL time have emerged. Here
we use the geometric-based measures, particularly Fisher and
Wigner-Yanase (WY) information metrics-based measures, as
well as the inherent dynamics-based measures, particularly
relative entropy, and entropy of coherence-based measures, to
compute the QSL time. The design and execution of quan-
tum information processing algorithms are significantly im-
pacted by the expansion of the QSL time to open quantum
systems [41, 46–48]. Due to its applicability to other tech-
nical areas, this has been a subject of considerable recent re-
search [40, 49–55]. Further, the idea of the lower bound for
the time required to transform an initial state to a final state in
a non-Markovian environment is an important area to explore
from the perspective of quantum thermodynamics [56, 57].
The fundamental laws of thermodynamic equilibrium and
nonequilibrium in the quantum regime are the subject of quan-
tum thermodynamics [58–62]. The emerging field of quantum
thermodynamics has grown rapidly over the last decade. The
main objective of quantum thermodynamics is to extend clas-
sical thermodynamics to incorporate quantum e ffects and tiny
ensemble sizes. This is facilitated by the rapid experimen-
tal control of quantum systems and the engineering of small
environments. The e ffect of memory on a quantum thermody-
namic system has been a recent area of interest [63–65]. The
extraction of maximal work from a system is an old problem
in thermodynamics. It was shown [66, 67] that in quantum
systems, this can be quantified by the ergotropy of the system.
The ergotropy has been established as an important quantity in
the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics [68–72] andarXiv:2305.10622v2  [quant-ph]  6 Jul 20232
has recently been measured experimentally [73, 74].
Quantum batteries are quantum-mechanical energy storage
devices [59, 75]. The role of quantum e ffects on the issue
of energy storage has been extensively studied in the last
years [76–82]. The problem of quantum battery’s charging
and discharging has been studied in an open quantum system
setting [83] along with the impact of non-Markovian evolu-
tion [63, 84]. In recent years, research on quantum batteries
has gained much attention, and various methods have been
employed to realize a practical quantum battery [85, 86]. To
this end, we aim to study a simple OQS model exhibiting non-
Markovian behavior, viz., a non-Markovian amplitude damp-
ing (NMAD) evolution. We exploit characterizers of quantum
thermodynamics, particularly ergotropy, along with instanta-
neous and average powers, to study this model from the per-
spective of a quantum battery. This is benchmarked by the
QSL time of the evolution of the system, where we use geo-
metric and inherent dynamics-based measures of QSL time.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we discuss
the preliminaries used throughout the paper, including the dis-
cussion of QSL time, an OQS model with NMAD evolution,
and ergotropy, instantaneous and average powers. Section III
discusses a direct connection between the physical properties-
based measure of QSL time and the coherent component of
the ergotropy. We study the connection of geometrical based-
measures of QSL time with ergotropy, instantaneous and aver-
age powers, and impact of non-Markovian evolution over the
discharging-charging process of quantum batteries in Sec. IV.
This is followed by conclusions.
II. PRELIMINARIES
This section briefly discusses di fferent bounds on the
quantum speed limit time, a single qubit model with non-
Markovian evolution modeled by the non-Markovian ampli-
tude damping (NMAD) master equation, and ergotropy fol-
lowed by instantaneous and average powers.
A. Quantum speed limit (QSL) time
Here we discuss four forms of the quantum speed limit
(QSL) time. The first two are related to the geometric QSL
time, where we use quantum Fisher information and Wigner
Yanase (WY) information metrics for the geodesic distance
between the initial and the final state at time t. The other two
measures depend on the inherent dynamics of the system, one
of which is a definition of QSL time using the relative purity
measure of a quantum state between initial and final states,
and the other is a QSL time based on the coherence of the
initial and final states.
1. Using quantum Fisher information metric
Mandelstam and Tamm (MT) and Margolus and Levitin
(ML)-type bounds on speed limit time [43, 45] are estimatedby using the geometric approach, using the Bures angle, to
quantify the closeness between the initial and final states. This
approach was used to provide a bound for the initial pure state
ρ0=|ψ0⟩⟨ψ0|, on the quantum speed limit time ( τQS L) [46] as

The three norms||·|| op,||·|| tr, and||·|| hsare the operator, trace,
and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, respectively. Lis the Liouvillian
superoperator acting on ρ. From the norm inequalities, it can
be shown that the operator norm of the generator provides a
tighter bound on the quantum speed limit time.
2. Using Wigner-Yanase information metric
Here we make use of the Wigner-Yanase information metric
given by
B(ρ0,ρt)=arccos Tr√ρ0√ρt, (3)
in the expression of the QSL time given in Eq. (1). The QSL
time obtained using this metric is ˜ τQS L. In [48], it was shown
that using this metric, one can get an upper bound on the QSL
time in the case of mixed states.
3. QSL time using relative purity measure
A bound on the QSL time for the open quantum systems can
be given based on the relative purity measure given in [47].
The bound to the required time of evolution, in this case, is
given as

0) is the rel-
ative purity measure, where ρ0is the initial state and ρtis
the state evolved to time t. In the denominator, we have
¯(·)=t−1Rt
0(·)ds.
4. QSL time for the coherence
There are several widely known (basis dependent) quantum
coherence measures, such as the relative entropy of coherence,
thel1norm of coherence, the geometric coherence, and the
robustness of coherence. The relative entropy of coherence3
is used because of its operational meaning as distillable co-
herence. In addition, it is also easier to work and compute
compared to some other measures of coherence. For a given
stateρ, the relative entropy of coherence C(ρ) defined as
C(ρ)=S(ρD)−S(ρ), (5)
whereρD=P
i⟨i|ρ|i⟩|i⟩⟨i|is the density operator that is diag-
onal in the reference basis, obtained by dephasing o ff-diagonal
elements of ρ, and S(ρ)=−Tr[ρlogρ] is the von Neumann
entropy of the state ρ.
For an arbitrary quantum dynamics of a finite-dimensional
quantum system describable as the time-evolution of its state,
the minimum time needed for the state ρtto attain coher-
ence C(ρt), starting with the initial coherence C(ρ0), is lower
bounded by quantum speed limit time for coherence ( τCS L)

B. The model
We consider an example of the decay of a two-state atom
into a bosonic reservoir [21]. The general form of the total
Hamiltonian is given as
H=HS⊗IB+IS⊗HB+HI, (7)
where HSis the system’s Hamiltonian, HBis the Hamiltonian
of the reservoir and interaction between the system and the
reservoir is given by the Hamiltonian HI. The form of the
system’s Hamiltonian is
HS=ω0σ+σ−, (8)
whereσ+=|1⟩⟨0|, andσ−=|0⟩⟨1|are the atomic raising
and lowering operators, respectively, with |0⟩(|1⟩) denoting
the ground (excited) state. The environment is represented by
a reservoir of harmonic oscillators given as
HB=X
kωka†
kak, (9)
where akanda†
kare the bosonic creation and annihilation op-
erators, satisfying the commutation relation [ ak,a†

The form of the interaction Hamiltonian can be given as

ber of excitations in the system N=σ+σ−+P

The dynamical map of the evolution of the reduced state of
the system, with the bath initially in the vacuum state, was
derived in [87] and is given by the quantum master equation

Eq. (11) provide the time-dependent frequency shift and de-
cay rates, respectively. Further, the quantity −2˙G(t)

In the limit λ < 2γ0, the decay rate becomes negative for
certain intervals giving rise to non-Markovian evolution, re-
ferred to as the non-Markovian amplitude damping (NMAD)
evolution. In the limit λ > 2γ0, the dynamics become time-
dependent Markovian. It can also be noted that for λ≫γ0,
the decay rate γ(t)=γ0, that is, it becomes time-independent,
and the evolution corresponds to the standard AD channel.
Further, using the Bloch vector representation of the single
qubit density matrix, we can write the density matrix of the
system at any time tas
ρ(t)=1
2 
1+z(t)x(t)−iy(t)
x(t)+iy(t) 1−z(t)!
, (14)
where x(t)=Tr[σxρ(t)],y(t)=Tr[σyρ(t)], and z(t)=
Tr[σzρ(t)]. For the case considered above, the analytical ex-
pression for the dynamical map was derived in [87], which is
given by
ρ00(t)=(1−|G(t)|2)ρ11(0)+ρ00(0),
ρ01(t)=ρ01(0)G∗(t),
ρ10(t)=ρ10(0)G(t),
ρ11(t)=ρ11(0)|G(t)|2, (15)
whereρi jis the element of the density matrix ρ(t), which we
get as the solution of Eq. (11). A straightforward comparison4
between Eqs. (15) and (14) gives us x(t),y(t), and z(t) in terms
of the function G(t). Thus, the Bloch vectors are given by
x(t)=2ℜ[ρ10(0)G(t)],
y(t)=−2ℑ[ρ10(0)G(t)],
z(t)=2ρ11(0)|G(t)|2−1. (16)
One may note that the function G(t) in Eq. (12) produces only
real values due to its structure in both regimes when lis real or
imaginary. Therefore, the value of y(t) in the above equation
is zero for a real initial state ρ(0).
We can envisage the system as a quantum battery in the
model studied here. The battery discharges when the er-
gotropy (discussed in the next subsection) of the system dis-
sipates to the environment. We start with a state with finite
ergotropy, and the ergotropy vanishes due to interaction with
the environment during the evolution of the system. How-
ever, due to the system’s P-indivisible non-Markovian evolu-
tion [35], the battery recharges again as the ergotropy revives.
This is highlighted in the subsequent sections.

master equation. The parameters are: ω0=1,λ=0.5, andγ0=10.
In Fig. 1, we compare the QSL time obtained using the
Fisher information metric ( τQS L), Wigner-Yanase (WY) infor-
mation metric (˜ τQS L), and the relative purity measure ( τ′
QS L).
The evolution of the quantum state is through the NMAD
master equation defined in Eq. (11). Here, we note that
the QSL time using the Fisher information metric for this
model was studied in [46, 88]. The initial state, in this
case, and subsequently is taken to be ρ(0)=|ψ0⟩⟨ψ0|, where
|ψ0⟩=√
3
2|0⟩+1
2|1⟩, with|0⟩and|1⟩being the ground and
excited state of the system, respectively. It can be observed
that qualitatively the QSL time obtained using WY and Fisher
information metrics are similar, with WY information giving
a tighter bound on the QSL time. This is consistent with the
comparison of both metrics in [48].C. Ergotropy, instantaneous and average power
Here we define the ergotropy, followed by instantaneous
and average powers. The categorization of ergotropy as a sum
of incoherent and coherence ergotropies is also defined.
1. Ergotropy
Ergotropy refers to the maximum amount of work that can
be extracted from a quantum system through a cyclic unitary
transformation of the initial state. The problem of maximal
extraction of work was discussed in [66]. For a state gov-
erned with a time-dependent Hamiltonian HS+V(t), the time-
dependent potential V(t) corresponds to the transfer of work
to external sources. The process is cyclic when the exter-
nal source is connected at time t=0 and disconnected at
time t=t0, i.e., the time-dependent potential has the form
V(0)=V(t0)=0. One then looks out for the maximum
work that can be extracted from the system for an arbitrary
V(t). To this e ffect, among all final states ρt0reached from
the initial state ρ0, we look for the state with the lowest fi-
nal energy Ef=Tr[ρt0HS]. The thermal equilibrium state
ρeq
t0=exp(−βHS)/Tr[exp(−βHS)] (whereβ=T−1, with
Tbeing the Temperature) under invariant von Neumann en-
tropy is the standard answer to this problem. The largest
amount of work that can be extracted in this case is Wth=
E(ρ0)−TS(ρ0)+Tlog(Z) [66], where S(·) is the von Neumann
entropy and Z=Tr[exp(−βHS)] is the partition function.
In the above, two arguments are made, one where we as-
sume that the initial state can be brought to a thermal equi-
librium state, and the other is that the entropy of the system
is invariant during this evolution. It is allowed for the macro-
scopic systems where dissipative processes within the system
may occur while the system evolves under the influence of
V(t). However, in the case of the finite systems, in general,
only the action of potential V(t) is not su fficient for a state to
reach the thermal state in time t0. Here, for the unitary evolu-
tion of the finite systems, not only the von Neumann entropy
but the eigenvalues of ρare also conserved. Unlike thermody-
namic systems, finite systems have the memory of their initial
state, and relaxation mechanisms are not involved. Therefore,
in these systems, the maximum amount of work extracted W,
called ergotropy, is generally smaller than Wth. Below we
outline the method to obtain ergotropy of the system. We
assume that we are given a quantum state ρ0with its inter-
nal Hamiltonian HSsuch that they have the following spectral
decomposition:
ρ0=X
iri|ri⟩⟨ri|, (17)
and
HS=X
iϵi|ϵi⟩⟨ϵi|, (18)
where ordering of the eigenvalues for ρ0andHSis in the de-
creasing, r1≥r2≥....,and increasing, ϵ1≤ϵ2≤..., order,5
respectively. Since unitary dynamics is considered, any de-
crease in the internal energy of the system at hand, with re-
spect to its self-Hamiltonian HS, will be extracted as work.
Thus, in order to find the ergotropy, one aims to minimize the
internal energy of the final state
W(ρ0)=Tr(ρ0HS)−min{Tr(UρU†HS)}, (19)
where the minimization is performed over all possible uni-
taries.
It can be shown that the final state ρt0=ρf=UρU†that
achieves this minimum should commute with HSand have
the same eigenvalues as ρ0, that is,ρf=P
jrj|ϵj⟩⟨ϵj|. This is
known as the passive state because no work can be extracted
from this state. The intuition for the order of eigenvalues
comes from the interpretation that the highest occupation frac-
tionr1ofρ0should occupy the lowest level. A unitary oper-
ator which performs such a transformation is U=P
j|ϵj⟩⟨rj|.
Now we can rewrite Eq. (19) as
W(ρ0)=X
j,irjϵi(|⟨rj|ϵi⟩|2−δi j). (20)
The ergotropyWdepends only on the initial state and Hamil-
tonian of the system. The upper bound on ergotropy is given
byWth≥ W ≥ 0, whereWthis equal toWwhen rj=
−βϵj−log(Z). Furthermore, ergotropy has already been stud-
ied for open quantum systems in [67, 84, 89]. In the previous
section, we discussed a simple open quantum system model-
ing a non-Markovian amplitude damping channel. To calcu-
late the ergotropy of the system, we make use of the solution
ρ(t) obtained after solving Eq. (11) for any time tand sup-
ply it as the initial state in the Eq. (19) to find the maximum
work that can be extracted from this state after a cyclic unitary
transformation. Physically, the work is extracted from the sys-
tem after it is detached from the bath and is now subjected to
the transformation stated above.
For the state ρ(t) given in Eq. (14), one can analyti-
cally calculate the ergotropy of the system with inherent sys-
tem Hamiltonian HSdefined by Eq. (8). To this end, the
eigenvalues of the state ρ(t) are1
2(1±|a(t)|), where|a(t)|=p
x(t)2+z(t)2. Note that we have dropped y(t) from the cal-
culations because it is zero for the case considered here, as
given in Eq. (16). The spectral decomposition of the HS=
ω0|1⟩⟨1|+0|0⟩⟨0|can now be used to find the passive state
ρf(t)=r1|0⟩⟨0|+r2|1⟩⟨1|, where 2 r1=1+|a(t)|≥1−|a(t)|=
2r2. The ergotropy of the system now boils down to
W(ρ(t))=Tr(ρ(t)HS)−Tr(ρf(t)HS),

In the above equation, z(t) denotes the population terms, and
x(t) denotes the coherence terms of the state at any time t(Eq.
(14)). The value of the ergotropy is non-zero whenever there
is coherence term x(t) present in the state. It becomes zero
only when x(t) is zero and z(t) is less than or equal to zero.Using the Eq. (16) and the initial state ρ(0)=|ψ0⟩⟨ψ0|, where
|ψ0⟩=√

the function G(t) as

.(22)
It was recently recognized [71, 72] that quantum ergotropy
can be separated into two di fferent (coherent and incoherent)
contributions
W=Wi+Wc. (23)
The incoherent ergotropy Widenotes the maximal work that
can be extracted from ρwithout changing its coherence, which
is defined as
Wi(ρ)=Tr{(ρ−σ)HS}, (24)
whereσis the coherence invariant state of ρ, which has prop-
erty
Tr{σHS}=min
U∈U(i)Trn
UρU†HSo
, (25)
whereU(i)is the set of unitary operations without changing
the coherence of ρ. Alternatively, the incoherent ergotropy
can be calculated using the state ρafter erasing all its coher-
ence terms by applying a dephasing map and then using the
same method used in calculating the full ergotropy for this
dephased state. That is, consider the state ρD=P
i⟨i|ρ|i⟩|i⟩⟨i|;
the incoherent ergotropy Wi(ρ) for stateρis equivalent to the
ergotropyWof the state ρD. The passive state ρD
f, in this
case, can be found in a similar way as done previously for the
calculation of ergotropy. Therefore,
Wi(ρ)=W(ρD)=Trh

The dephased state ρD(t) for the state ρ(t) in Eq. (14) is given
by1
2[(1+z(t))|1⟩⟨1|+(1−z(t))|0⟩⟨0|], and the corresponding
passive state ρD
f(t) depends on the sign of z(t). Considering
the case z(t)<0, we find that 1 +z(t) is lesser than 1−z(t).
To this end, the passive state ρf
D(t) is found to be the same as
ρD(t); therefore, the incoherent ergotropy Wi(ρ(t)) becomes
zero. However, if z(t)≥0, then 1 +z(t) is greater than 1−z(t)
andρD
f(t)=1
2[(1−z(t))|1⟩⟨1|+(1+z(t))|0⟩⟨0|]. In this case,
for the system Hamiltonian HS=ω0|1⟩⟨1|, the incoherent er-
gotropy is given by
Wi(ρ(t))=ω0z(t).forz(t)≥0
0. forz(t)<0(27)
Upon comparing the above equation with Eq. (21), we ob-
serve that for positive z(t) and zero coherence term x(t)/2, the
incoherent ergotropy Wibecomes equal to the ergotropy W.
Further, the incoherent ergotropy is always positive here and
gets contribution only from the population terms of ρ(t). The
incoherent ergotropy in terms of the function G(t) and the ini-
tial stateρ(0) defined above Eq. (22), is given by
Wi(ρ(t))=ω0G(t)2−2
2.forG(t)2≥2
0. forG(t)2<2(28)6
Moreover, it is straightforward now to get the expression
for the coherent ergotropy Wc=W−W ifor the state ρ(t)
given in Eq. (14) and system Hamiltonian HSin Eq. (8). This
is given by
Wc(ρ(t))=ω0

The coherent ergotropy Wcis the work that is exclusively
stored in the coherence. his can be verified from the above
equation. We note here that whenever the coherence term
x(t)/2 of the state ρ(t) is zero, the coherent ergotropy of the
system also becomes zero. Also, the coherent ergotropy be-
comes the full ergotropy for the negative values of z(t). The
expression of coherent ergotropy Wcin terms of the function
G(t) and for initial state ρ(0) can be obtained in a similar man-
ner as done for ergotropy and incoherent ergotropy using Eq.
(16). Furthermore, we outline the relationship between the
coherent ergotropy and the relative entropy of coherence C(ρ)
defined in Eq. (5). The expression was derived in [71] and
can be given via quantum relative entropy as

andβ=1/kBT, with Tbeing the temperature. Despite the
fact that in Eq. (30), temperature Tis present explicitly, yet
upon substituting the values of all the terms in the right-hand
side using Eq. (14) and dividing with β, we get the same ex-
pression as in Eq. (29), i.e., free of T.
We next establish a relation between the coherent ergotropy
and another quantifier of the coherence of a quantum state
given by l1norm of coherence [90], defined as
Cl1(ρ)=X
i,j,i,j|ρi,j|, (32)
For the state of the form of Eq. (14) with y(t) being zero, the
value ofCl1(ρ(t)) is given by
Cl1(ρ(t))=|x(t)|. (33)
Using the above equation and Eq. (29), for the case studied
here, we can write coherent ergotropy Wcin terms ofCl1(ρ(t))
as
Wc(ρ(t))=ω0

(34)
We note that in case the value of z(t) becomes zero, the co-
herent ergotropyWcgets directly proportional to the value of
Cl1(ρ(t)).2. Average and instantaneous power
The instantaneous charging power is defined by available
work in the battery as
P(t)=lim
∆t→0W(t+ ∆t)−W (t)
∆t=dW

Using Eq. (21), we can write the instantaneous power P(t) as
P(t)=ω0

x(t)2+z(t)2+˙z(t). (36)
It is also possible to define the average power-to-energy trans-
fer given by
Pav=W(t)−W (t0)
t−t0, (37)
where t−t0refers to the charging time of the battery.
We will now see the connection between various forms of
the quantum speed limit, particularly QSL time for coherence
and using relative purity measure, with the ergotropy, with the
dynamics being generated by the NMAD model.
III. CONNECTION OF THE QUANTUM SPEED LIMITS
WITH THE COHERENT ERGOTROPY
This section first discusses the connection between the QSL
for coherence and coherent ergotropy. Further, we connect the
QSL time obtained using the relative purity measure and the
coherent ergotropy.
A. Connection between the QSL for coherence and the
coherent ergotropy

ence in terms of coherent ergotropy as

Plugging the above equation in Eq. (6) for the state ρ(t) at

Here, and subsequently, in the next sections, we take the initial
state to beρ(0)=|ψ0⟩⟨ψ0|, where|ψ0⟩=√

value of C(ρ(0)) for this initial state is around 0 .56. Using the
Bloch vector representation of the state ρ(t) (Eq. (14)), the7
relative entropy of coherence C(ρ(t)) is given by
C(ρ(t))=− 1+z(t)

where|a(t)|=p
x(t)2+z(t)2, asy(t) is zero for the case con-
sidered here. We note here that for the given initial state ρ(0)
above, the value of z(t) remains negative for the whole dy-
namics. Interestingly, in this case, the value of ergotropy W
and coherent ergotropy Wcis exactly the same. Therefore,
the relationship between the coherent ergotropy WcandτCS L
corresponds to a relationship between ergotropy WandτCS L
too. Further, the relative entropy of coherence C(ρ(t)) van-
ishes whenever x(t) is zero, and at those points in time, the
ergotropyWand coherence ergotropy Wcare also zero. This
is depicted in Fig. 2. At these points in time, the τCS Lachieves
a local maximum, which is intuitive because the numerator of
τCS Lis locally maximum. In Fig. 2, we can see the variation

andγ0=10.
of the QSL time for coherence ( τCS L) and the characterizers of
quantum thermodynamics, particularly ergotropy ( W), coher-
ent ergotropy (WC), instantaneous (P(t)) and average (Pav)
powers. The region in the ergotropy curve denoted by the
brown “ +” symbols indicates the battery’s charging process,
while the black “|” symbols depict the discharging process in
the given cycle from time t=1 to 3. During the charging pro-
cess, the instantaneous power is positive and negative while
the battery is discharging. Further, in this case, we observe
that the maxima and minima of the τCS Lare in contrast with
the erogtropy and coherent ergotropy’s maxima and minima.
This shows that the speed of evolution of the coherence of the
state during the discharging process is getting slower. This
speed hits its minimum when the ergotropy is zero. However,
during the charging process, when ergotropy again becomesnon-zero, the speed of evolution of the coherence increases
and reaches its maximum when the battery is fully charged.
We also point out here that one can take a di fferent initial state
ρ(0) and can get some contribution to ergotropy from the in-
coherent ergotropy too. However, the dynamics of the system
characterized by the NMAD master equation quickly drives
the system’s state in such a way that the value of z(t) becomes
negative. In this case, at longer times, the coherent ergotropy
eventually becomes equal to the ergotropy of the system.
B. QSL time for relative purity measure and coherent
ergotropy
Here, we start with the Eq. (4) using the initial state ρ(0)
used in the previous section and the Bloch vector form of
the system’s state ρ(t) given in Eq. (14) at any time t. To
this end, the value of Tr[ ρ(0)2] is one as we have consid-
ered an initial pure state. The value of the relative purity
f(t)=Tr[ρ(t)ρ(0)]/Tr[ρ(0)2] is now given by
f(t)=1

Here, we again mention that the value of z(t) for the given
initial state ρ(0) is always negative. Therefore, the incoherent
ergotropy is zero, and the coherent ergotropy is equal to the
ergotropy of the system. Further, we observe that in contrast
toτCS L’s variation of the numerator, in this case, when the
coherence term x(t) and the ergotropy and coherent ergotropy
goes to zero, the numerator obtains a minimum value.
Figure 3 depicts the connection between the QSL time us-
ing relative purity measure ( τ′
QS L) with ergotropy (W), coher-
ent ergotropy (Wc), instantaneous (P(t)), average (Pav) pow-
ers. It can be observed that, in this case, the peaks and valleys
ofτ′
QS Lare in contrast with the peaks and valleys of instan-
taneous power. This indicates that changes in the τ′
QS Lpick
up the maximal rate of charging or discharging of the bat-
tery, with a maximum in τ′
QS Lcorresponding to the maximum
discharging rate of the battery and a minimum in τ′
QS Lcorre-
sponds to the maximum charging rate, in a given charging and
discharging cycle.

lution of the system under Markovian evolution is depicted.

but due to the Markovian evolution, there is no revival in the
ergotropy or charging of the battery. This brings out the fact
that in the present qubit-bath setup, the non-Markovian nature
of the evolution plays a crucial role in highlighting the role of
the system as a battery. Further, the QSL time obtained using
the Fisher information metric ( τQS L) is also monotonically in-
creasing; that is, the speed of evolution of the system keeps
slowing down with time.

using Fisher ( τQS L) and WY (˜τQS L) information metrics show
a similar pattern. In both cases, we observe that either of the
peaks or valleys of the τQS Land ˜τQS Loccurs exactly at the
points when a cycle of complete discharging and recharging
to a maximum value complete. This coincides with the points
where the average power is calculated. The revivals in the er-
gotropy (or recharging of the battery) are completely due to
the non-Markovian nature of the system in both figures. This
also brings out a di fference between the QSL time obtained
using inherent dynamics of the system, particularly QSL time
for coherence ( τCS Lin Fig. 2) and using relative purity mea-
sure (τ′
QS Lin Fig. 3), and the QSL time obtained using geo-9
metric measures in Figs. 5 and 6. The peaks and valleys of the
τCS Landτ′
QS Lspecify the discharging and charging processes,
being exact for τCS L. However, the peaks and valleys of τQS L
and ˜τQS Lspecify the completion of a discharging-charging cy-
cle. This thus brings out a di fference between the geomet-
ric and physical properties-based measures of QSL time from
the perspective of discharging-charging processes. It can also
be seen that the speed of evolution first decreases and then
increases, oscillating around a fixed point later. This again
benchmarks the non-Markovian nature of the system.
V . CONCLUSIONS
Here we have studied the impact of non-Markovian evo-
lution on the quantities characterizing quantum thermody-
namics, particularly ergotropy and its components, and in-
stantaneous and average powers. We explored the connec-
tion of these quantities with the quantum speed limit (QSL)
time of evolution. The characterization of the QSL time was
done using both geometric and physical properties-based mea-
sures. Fisher and Wigner-Yanase information metrics were
used for the geometric-based measures ( τQS Land ˜τQS L, re-
spectively), and relative purity and relative entropy of co-
herence were used for the physical properties-based measure
(τCS Landτ′
QS L, respectively) of QSL time. We considered
the evolution of a single qubit system interacting with the
bosonic bath through the non-Markovian amplitude damping
(NMAD) master equation. Having an initial finite ergotropy,
we proposed that the system could be envisaged as a quantum
battery discharging into the bosonic environment.The coherent and incoherent components of erogtropy were
discussed. It was observed that due to the nature of the non-
Markovian amplitude damping evolution of the state, the con-
tribution to the ergotropy in the form of incoherent ergotropy
quickly vanishes, and the coherent ergotropy becomes equiva-
lent to the ergotropy of the system. Further, direct connections
between the coherent ergotropy and QSL time using relative
purity and relative entropy of coherence measures were ex-
plored. It was observed that QSL time obtained using phys-
ical properties-based measures identified the discharging and
charging process of the quantum battery. This was di fferent
from the geometric-based measures that brought out the con-
nection between the completion of the discharging-charging
cycle and the change in the speed of evolution of the sys-
tem. The revivals in the ergotropy of the system (or recharg-
ing of the battery) only occurred in the non-Markovian limit.
It was observed that in the Markovian limit, the battery only
discharged, and the speed of evolution was monotonically de-
creasing (QSL time was monotonically increasing). There-
fore, the non-Markovian evolution is crucial when modeling
the system as a quantum battery.
