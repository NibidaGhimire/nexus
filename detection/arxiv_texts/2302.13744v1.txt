DEBANJANA KUNDU AND ANTONIO LEI
Abstract. Fix two distinct odd primes pandq. We study " p/negationslash=q" Iwasawa theory in two
diﬀerent settings.
(1) LetKbe an imaginary quadratic ﬁeld of class number 1 such that bot hpandqsplit inK.
We show that under appropriate hypotheses, the p-part of the ideal class groups is bounded over
ﬁnite subextensions of an anticyclotomic Zq-extension of K.
(2) LetFbe a number ﬁeld and let A/Fbe an abelian variety with A[p]⊆A(F). We give suﬃcient
conditions for the p-part of the ﬁne Selmer groups of Aover ﬁnite subextensions of a Zq-extension
ofFto stabilize.
1.Introduction
LetF/Qbe an algebraic number ﬁeld and F∞/Fbe a Galois extension with Galois group iso-
morphic to the additive group Zqofq-adic integers. For each integer n≥0, there is a unique
subﬁeldFn/Fof degreeqn. Leth(Fn)be the class number of Fn. K. Iwasawa showed that if qenis
the highest power of qdividingh(Fn), then there exist integers λ,µ,ν independent of n, such that
en=µqn+λn+νforn≫0. On the other hand, in [ Was75 ,Was78 ], L. C. Washington proved that
for distinct primes pandq, thep-part of the class number stabilizes in the cyclotomic Zq-extension
of an abelian number ﬁeld. Washington’s results have been ex tended to other Zq-extensions where
primes are ﬁnitely decomposed. In particular, J. Lamplugh p roved the following in [ Lam15 ]: ifp,q
are distinct primes ≥5that split in an imaginary quadratic ﬁeld Kof class number 1 and F/K
is a prime-to- pabelian extension which is also unramiﬁed at p, then thep-class group stabilizes in
theZq-extension of Fwhich is unramiﬁed outside precisely one of the primes above q. There have
also been speculations by J. Coates on the size of the whole cl ass group in a cyclotomic tower; see
[Coa12 ], especially the discussion in §3 and Conjecture D.
Letpandqbe two distinct odd primes and Kan imaginary quadratic ﬁeld of class number 1 in
which both pandqsplit. We write pOK=ppandqOK=qq. Given an ideal hofOK, we write R(h)
for the ray class ﬁeld of Kof conductor h. In the ﬁrst half of this article, we study the growth of the
p-part of the ideal class group in a Zq-anticyclotomic tower. This generalizes [ Lam15 , Theorem 1.3],
where the stability of the p-part of the class numbers R(gqn)is studied. More precisely, we prove
the following result.
Theorem A. LetKbe an imaginary quadratic ﬁeld of class number 1. Let pandqbe distinct primes
(≥5) which split in K. Letrbe a ﬁxed ideal of OKcoprime to pqsuch that ris a product of split
primes1. LetF=R(rq). We assume that p∤[F:K]. Let R(rq∞)ac/Fdenote the anticyclotomic
Zq-extension and write Fnfor the unique subextension of R(rq∞)ac/Fwhose degree is qn. Then
there exists an integer Nsuch that for all n≥N,
ordp(h(Fn)) = ord p(h(FN)).

12 D. KUNDU AND A. LEI
The hypothesis on rbeing a product of split primes is crucial for the use of a theo rem of H. Hida,
which guarantees the non-vanishing modulo pof the algebraic L-values of anticyclotomic characters
factoring through R(rq∞)ac(see Theorem 3.2). To prove Theorem A, we link this non-vanishing to
the stabilization of the p-class groups via the ( p-adic) Iwasawa main conjecture proved by K. Rubin
[Rub91 ]. Our strategy is inspired by the work of Lamplugh [ Lam15 ], which we outline below.
In §2, we introduce an auxiliary elliptic curve E/Kwith CM by OKsuch that the conductor
fof its Hecke character is a product of split primes in Kwithp∤[R(f):K]. Letg= lcm(f,r).
By a result of Lamplugh, when the algebraic L-value of certain Hecke character is nonzero modulo
p, the corresponding modules of local p-adic units and elliptic units over an extension generated
byE[p∞]coincide after taking appropriate isotypic components (se e Theorem 4.2for the precise
statement). Combining this with Hida’s theorem, we prove in Theorem 4.3that thep-primary
Galois modules featured in the Iwasawa main conjecture stab ilize in the anticyclotomic Zq-extension
R(gq∞)ac/R(gq). This can be translated into a statement on p-class groups, proving a special case of
Theorem A, where the ideal ris divisible by f(see Theorem 4.4). To complete the proof of Theorem A,
we bound the p-class groups over the tower R(rq∞)ac/R(rq)by those over R(gq∞)ac/R(gq).
In the second half of the article, we prove a general statemen t (see Theorem 5.3) which shows that
in certain Zq-extensions of a number ﬁeld F, the growth of the p-part of the class group is closely
related to that of the p-primary ﬁneSelmer group of an abelian variety A/F. This subgroup of the
classicalp-primary Selmer group is denoted by Sel0(A/F), and is obtained by imposing stronger
vanishing conditions at primes above p(the precise deﬁnition is reviewed in § 5.1). The following
result is an application of the aforementioned theorem to th e growth of the p-part of ﬁne Selmer
group of a ﬁxed abelian variety Aover aZq-tower (which is not necessarily anticyclotomic).
Theorem B. Letpandqbe distinct odd primes. Let Fbe any number ﬁeld and A/Fbe an abelian
variety such that A[p]⊆A(F). LetF∞/Fbe aZq-extension where the primes above qand the
primes of bad reduction of Aare ﬁnitely decomposed. If there exists N≥0such that for all n≥N,
ordp(h(Fn)) = ord p(h(FN)),
then there exists an integer N′≥Nsuch that for all n≥N′, there is an isomorphism
Sel0(A/Fn)≃Sel0(A/FN′).
In particular, Theorem Bapplies to the setting studied by Washington [ Was75 ,Was78 ]. Finally,
we remark that unlike what we have found for ﬁne Selmer groups in Theorem B, it has been shown
by T. Dokchitser and V. Dokchitser that the p-part of the Tate–Shafarevich group of an abelian
variety in a Zq-tower can be unbounded; see [ DD15 , Example 1.5].

2.Finding auxiliary CM elliptic curves
LetK=Q(√
−d)be an imaginary quadratic ﬁeld of class number 1. As discusse d in the intro-
duction, we shall work with an auxiliary CM elliptic curve E/Kin order to prove Theorem A. Recall
that the imaginary quadratic ﬁelds of class number 1 are prec isely the following
Q(√
−1),Q(√
−2),Q(√
−3),Q(√
−7),Q(√
−11),Q(√
−19),Q(√
−43),Q(√
−67),Q(√
−163).
For each choice of K, we shall write down an explicit elliptic curve E/Ksuch that
(a)Ehas CM by OK;
(b) Iffdenotes the conductor of the Hecke character ψattached to E, thenfis only divisible by
split primes of K;p/negationslash=qIWASAWA THEORY OF CLASS GROUPS AND FINE SELMER GROUPS 3
(c) The rational primes dividing [R(f):K]are either 2,3or primes that are non-split in K.
We remark that condition (c) ensures that the prime pin the statement of Theorem Adoes not
divide[R(f):K].
IfE/Kis an elliptic curve with CM by an order OinK, thej-invariantj(E)is an integer in this
case, soEmust be a twist of the base extension of an elliptic curve A/Q. Ford>3,Ais uniquely
determined (up to isomorphism over K) by the condition that it has CM by OKand its base change
toKhas bad reduction at the ramiﬁed prime P= (√
−d). Ford= 1,2,and3there are several
choices for the elliptic curve over Q(see [CP19, Remark 3.1]).
Whend>3, it follows from [ CP19, Theorem 3.3] that if we twist A/Kby a character correspond-
ing toK(√α)whereα=PQsuch that Qis a prime of Kdistinct from Psatisfying Q≡u2√
−d
mod 4OKfor someu∈ OK, then the twisted elliptic curve (over K) has good reduction everywhere
except at Q. Therefore, for our purposes, it is enough to ﬁnd such Qthat is a split prime in K.
Indeed, we may choose r∈Zsuch that (4r+√
−d)(4r−√
−d) = 16r2+dis an odd rational prime.
Suchrexists for all possible values of d. For example, we may take rto be1whend= 43,67,163.
Then4r+√
−dis a split prime of Kand4r+√
−d≡12√
−dmod 4OK. In particular, we may
apply [ CP19, Theorem 3.3] with Q= (4r+√
−d)andu= 1, resulting in a CM curve Esatisfying
properties (a) and (b) above.
Whend<43, we ﬁndE/Kby inspection using the data available on [ LMF23 ]. In all our examples
below,E/Khas bad reduction at one or two split primes which are coprime to6. In particular, the
conductor of E/Kis given by square of the product of the bad prime(s), whereas the conductor
fof the Hecke character ψattached to Eis given by the product of the bad prime(s) (see [ ST68,
Theorem 12]). The ray class group Gal(R(f)/K)(and hence [R(f):K]) is computed using MAGMA
[BCP97 ].

3.A result of Hida on L-values of anticyclotomic Hecke characters
Throughout this section and the next, Kis a ﬁxed imaginary quadratic ﬁeld of class number
1. We ﬁx an elliptic curve E/Kwith CM by OKas given in § 2. Recall that ψdenotes the Hecke
character over Kwith conductor fattached to E.
We review a special case of a result of Hida from [ Hid07 ] that will play a crucial role in our proof
of Theorem A.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Lethbe any integral ideal of Kand letǫbe any Hecke character of K. The
h-imprimitive L-function ofǫis deﬁned as follows
Lh(ǫ,s) =/productdisplay
gcd(ν,h)=1/parenleftbigg
1−ǫ(ν)
(Nν)s/parenrightbigg−1
=/summationdisplay
gcd(a,h)=1ǫ(a)
(Na)s,4 D. KUNDU AND A. LEI
where the product runs over prime ideals νofKcoprime to h, and sum is taken over integral ideals
acoprime to h.
Fix an integral ideal gofKwhich is divisible by f, relatively prime to pq, and such that only
split primes of Kdivideg. LetF=R(gq)be the ray class ﬁeld ofKof conductor gqand write
∆ = Gal(F/K). SetF∞=/uniontext
n≥1R(gqn); this is a Z2
q-extension of F. We ﬁx an isomorphism
Gal(F∞/K)≃Gal(F/K)×Gal(K∞/K) = ∆×Z2
q.
Letǫbe a character of Gal(F∞/K). For our purpose, ǫwill be of the form ϕψk, whereϕis a
ﬁnite-order character and kis an integer between 1andp−1. Denote by L(ǫ,s)theprimitive Hecke
L-function ofǫ. Recall that the imprimitive (or partial) L-function diﬀers from the primitive (or
classical)L-function by a ﬁnite number of Euler factors. Let NK/Qdenote the norm map. We can
further deﬁne the primitive algebraic Hecke L-value ,
Lalg(ϕψk) =Lalg(ǫ):=L(ǫ,k)
Ωk∞=L/parenleftBig
ϕψkN−k
K/Q,0/parenrightBig
Ωk∞.
Here,Ω∞denotes a complex period for E/C. Similarly, given an integral ideal hofK, we deﬁne the
h-imprimitive algebraic Hecke L-value ,
Lalg
h(ϕψk) =Lalg
h(ǫ):=Lh(ǫ,k)
Ωk∞=Lh/parenleftBig
ϕψkN−k
K/Q,0/parenrightBig
Ωk∞.
Note thatLandLhdiﬀer by the omission of the Euler factors at primes dividing h.
In what follows, we say that a Hecke character ǫofKis ofinﬁnity type (a,b)if its inﬁnity
component sends xtoxaxb. Under this convention, ψhas inﬁnity type (−1,0), whereas the norm
mapNK/Qis of inﬁnity type (−1,−1). Thus, the Hecke character ψkN−k
K/Qis of inﬁnity type (k,0).
Henceforth, we ﬁx a prime v|pofFand an embedding Q⊂Qpso thatvis sent into the maximal
idealmQpofOQp. This allows us to consider Lalg
h(ϕψk)as elements of Qp. Throughout, πis a ﬁxed
uniformizer of Fvand we write ordπfor the valuation on Qpnormalized so that ordπ(π) = 1.
Theorem 3.2 (Hida).For all but ﬁnitely many characters ϕthat factor through R(gq∞)ac, we have
ordπ/parenleftBig
Lalg
(q)(ϕψk)/parenrightBig
= 0.
Proof. For eachϕ, we have ϕ=φη, whereφis a character of ∆andηis a character of the
Galois group Gal(R(gq∞)ac/F). We may further decompose φintoφ′ν−1, whereνis a character of
Gal(F/R(g))andφ′is a character of Gal(R(g)/K). We have the ﬁeld diagram:
QKR(g)R(gq) =FR(gq∞)ac
η
ν−1
φ′∆Zqp/negationslash=qIWASAWA THEORY OF CLASS GROUPS AND FINE SELMER GROUPS 5
We take the CM ﬁeld Min [Hid07 ] to be the imaginary quadratic ﬁeld K. We take the CM type Σ
there to be the one that corresponds to the inﬁnity type (1,0)andκ= 0. Then the inﬁnity type of
the character λinop. cit. becomes
kΣ+0(1−c) =k(1,0)+(0,0)−(0,0) = (k,0).
The condition (M1) in [ Hid07 , Theorem 4.3] does not hold since K/Qis not unramiﬁed everywhere
(it ramiﬁes at the primes dividing the discriminant of K, which is nontrivial). Hence, we can apply
the aforementioned theorem with λandχ−1taken to be ψkN−kφ′andη, respectively. /square
Remark 3.3 ([Lam14 , proof of Theorem 3.1.9]) .Letgbe a ﬁxed ideal as before. Fix an ideal hof
OKwhich is coprime to pand divisible by gq. Recall that the h-imprimitive algebraic L-value of
ϕψkis given by
Lalg
h(ϕψk) =Lh(ϕψk,k)
Ωk∞.
Then, for almost all characters of Gal/parenleftbig
R(gq∞)ac/F/parenrightbig∼=Zq, we have that
ordπ/parenleftBig
Lalg
(q)(ϕψk)/parenrightBig
= ordπ/parenleftBig
Lalg
h(ϕψk)/parenrightBig
.
This follows from the observation that for a given prime idea laofKthat is coprime to q, for almost
all characters η,
ordπ/parenleftBigg
1−ϕψk(a)
(Na)k/parenrightBigg
= 0
sinceηsendsato aq-power root of unity, and the images of q-power roots of unity under the
reduction map on OQpmodulomQpare distinct.
4.Consequences on class groups
We now use Theorem 3.2to study the growth of the p-part of the class group in an anticyclotomic
Zq-extension. Let us introduce the necessary notation. Throu ghout,p∤6qis a ﬁxed prime that is
split inKandE/Kis a ﬁxed CM elliptic curve as in the previous section (with He cke character ψ
whose conductor is f). LetK0be any ﬁnite abelian extension of Ksuch thatpis unramiﬁed in K0and
p∤[K0:K](in the next subsection, we will let K0vary inside the anticyclotomic tower R(gq∞)ac).
Fix a prime pofKlying above p. SetL=K0(Ep)andL∞=L(Ep∞). Let∆ = Gal(L/K)and
Γ = Gal(L∞/L)≃Zp. LetG= Gal(L∞/K)∼=∆×ΓandΛ =Zp/llbracketG/rrbracket.
Following [ Rub91 ], we write C(L∞)(resp.U(L∞)) for the inverse limits over all ﬁnite sub-
extensions inside L∞of the completion of the elliptic units (resp. local princip al units) at p.
Fix an ideal hofOKwhich is coprime to p, is divisible by f, and is such that K0⊂K(Eh) =R(h).
LetµKbe the group of roots of unity of Kandλ∈ OK\µKsuch thatλ≡1 modhwith(λ,6hp) = 1.
We letσ(λ)∈Gal(K0/K)denote the Artin symbol associated to λ.
We further decompose ∆asH×I, whereH= Gal(K0/K)andI= Gal(K0(Ep)/K0). Here,Iis
the inertia subgroup at pinside∆. Letθpdenote the canonical character given by the Galois action
onEp∞restricted to I. Given a character χof∆, we write it as ϕθk
p, whereϕis a character of H
and1≤k≤p−1. We have the following diagram:6 D. KUNDU AND A. LEI
QKK0L=K0(Ep)L∞=L(Ep∞)
θk
p
ϕ∆Zp
Before proceeding, we need to introduce the notion of an anom alous prime.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Fix a prime pand a number ﬁeld K. Letvbe a prime above pinKand writeκvto
denote the corresponding residue ﬁeld. In the sense of Mazur (see [Maz72 , p. 186]),Eisanomalous
atvif/tildewideE(κv)[p]/\egatio\slash= 0.
Letwbe a prime in L∞which lies above v. Denote by Zthe decomposition subgroup at pinside
G. Sincegcd(p,|∆|) = 1 , the action of ∆∩ Zonµp∞(L∞,w) =µpMgives aZp-valued character
which we denote by χcyc:∆∩Z →µp−1⊆Z×
p.
We now record a theorem of Lamplugh which will be important fo r our discussion.
Theorem 4.2. Letχ=ϕθk
pbe a character of ∆. WhenE/K0is anomalous at a prime above p,
we assume that χ|∆∩Zis not the cyclotomic character. Let handλbe as above. If
ordπ/parenleftbigg/parenleftBig
N(λ)−λkϕ(σ(λ))/parenrightBig
·Lalg
h(ϕψk)/parenrightbigg
= 0,
thenC(L∞)χ=U(L∞)χ. Here,Mχdenotes the χ-isotypic component of a Λ-moduleM.
Proof. See [Lam15 , Theorem 7.7]. /square
4.1.Variations of class groups. LetF=R(gq)for some ideal gofOKsuch that gis divisible
byf, is a product of primes that split in K,pis unramiﬁed in F/K,p∤[F:K], and is coprime
topq. Furthermore, we assume that both qandqare tamely ramiﬁed in F. Then R(gq∞)acis a
Zq-extension of F, and for integers n≥0, letFn/Fbe then-th layer of this Zq-extension. Note that
only primes above qramify inFn/F,p∤[Fn:K](sinceq/\egatio\slash=p), andFn⊆R(gqn+1). Therefore, we
may takeK0andhin the previous section to be Fnandgqn+1, respectively.
Forn≥1, just as before we deﬁne Ln=Fn(Ep),Ln,∞=Fn(Ep∞),∆n=Hn×I,Gn= ∆n×Γ,
Un,∞=U(Ln,∞), etc. As mentioned previously, we now let K0vary inside the anticyclotomic tower
R(gq∞)ac. Note that I= Gal(K0(Ep)/K0)∼=Gal(Ln/Fn). DeﬁneXn,∞to be the Galois group of
the maximal abelian p-extension of Ln,∞which is unramiﬁed outside p. By global class ﬁeld theory
we have the following four-term exact sequence
(1) 0→En,∞/Cn,∞→Un,∞/Cn,∞→Xn,∞→An,∞→0.
Here,En,∞=E(Ln,∞)is used to denote the global units of Ln,∞. Finally,An,∞=A(Ln,∞)is the
inverse limit of the p-part of the class group for each ﬁnite extension of Fncontained inside Ln,∞.
In other words, An,∞can be identiﬁed with the Galois group of the maximal abelian unramiﬁed
p-extension of Ln,∞. We now prove the key result which will be required in proving Theorem A.p/negationslash=qIWASAWA THEORY OF CLASS GROUPS AND FINE SELMER GROUPS 7
Theorem 4.3. There exists an integer N≥0such thatXI

Proof. Letn≥0be an integer and consider a character ηofGal(Fn/F)∼=Z/qn. Letφ0be a
character of Gal(F/K)andkan integer that is a multiple of p−1so thatθk
pis the trivial character.
Setϕ=ηφ0. We draw the following ﬁeld diagram for the convenience of th e reader.

LetOdenote the ring of integers of the unique unramiﬁed Zq-extension of Fv. In other words,
O=OFv(µq∞). Letλ∈ OK\µKsuch thatλ≡1 modhand(λ,6hp) = 1 (whereh=gqn+1). We
have
/parenleftBig
λλ−λkϕ(σ(λ))/parenrightBig

⇔ηφ0(σ(λ))≡λλ1−k(modπO)
⇔η(σ(λ))≡λλ1−kφ−1
0(σ(λ)) (modπO).
Note thatηhas exact order qmfor somem≥1. Therefore, η(σ(λ))is a primitive qm-th root of unity.
But inO/πO, theq-power roots of unity are distinct. Therefore, by the same ar gument outlined
in Remark 3.3, there exists an integer N1such that for all characters ηofGal(Fn/F)which do not
factor through ∆N1(withn≥N1),
(2) ordπ/parenleftBig
NK/Q(λ)−λkϕ(σ(λ))/parenrightBig
= 0.
By Theorem 3.2and Remark 3.3, one can choose a suﬃciently large N2such that

Lalg
h(ϕψk)/parenrightBig
= 0
for all characters ϕof∆nwhich do not factor through ∆N2(withn≥N2).
SetN= max(N1,N2). Ifχ=ϕis a character of ∆nwhich does not factor through ∆N(with
n≥N), then ( 2) and ( 3) imply that
ordπ/parenleftbigg/parenleftBig

TakeK0in Theorem 4.2to beFn. Since the restriction of the character ϕtoIis trivial, the
hypothesis regarding E/K0when a prime above pis an anomalous prime always holds. Therefore,
we deduce that

Next, via the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory for imaginar y quadratic ﬁelds (see [ Rub91 , Theo-
rem 4.1(i)]) we can conclude that there exists an integer N≥0such that
charΛ(XI
n,∞) = char Λ(XI
N,∞)
for alln≥N. Now, consider the restriction map
πn,N:XI
n,∞։XI
N,∞.
Since characteristic ideals are multiplicative in short ex act sequences, the kernel of the above sur-
jective map must be ﬁnite. However, a theorem of R. Greenberg (see [Gre78 , Theorem §1]) ensures
that there are no non-trivial ﬁnite submodules inside XI
n,∞. This forces the kernel to be trivial, i.e.,
XI
n,∞=XI
N,∞.
The proof of the theorem is now complete. /square
We can now state and prove the auxiliary result that will allo w us to conclude Theorem A. Our
proof follows the proof of [ Lam15 , Theorem 7.10] very closely. We repeat the statement below f or
the convenience of the reader.
Theorem 4.4. LetKbe an imaginary quadratic ﬁeld of class number 1. Let pandqbe distinct
primes (≥5) which split in K. Letgbe a ﬁxed ideal of OKcoprime to pqsuch that gis a product
of split primes and is divisible by the conductor of an ellipti c curve over Kwith CM by OK. Let
F=R(rq). We assume that p∤[F:K]. Let R(rq∞)ac/Fdenote the anticyclotomic Zq-extension
and writeFnfor the unique subextension of R(rq∞)ac/Fwhose degree is qn. Then, there exists an
integerNsuch that for all n≥N,
ordp(h(Fn)) = ord p(h(FN)).
Proof. Let thep-class group of Fn(resp.FN) be denoted by A(Fn)(resp.A(FN)). Sincepdoes
not divide [Fn:FN], we have an injection
(4) A(FN)֒→A(Fn).
It follows from global class ﬁeld theory that for all n≥0, we have the identiﬁcation
An,∞≃Gal(Mn,∞/Ln,∞),
whereMn,∞is the maximal abelian unramiﬁed p-extension of Ln,∞. Consider the following diagram
AI
N,∞/d47/d47
/d15/d15AI
n,∞
/d15/d15
A(FN) /d47/d47A(Fn)
where the vertical maps are given by restriction and are surj ective because the extension Ln,∞/Fn
andLN,∞/FNare totally ramiﬁed at primes above p. Furthermore, the top horizontal map is
surjective by Theorem 4.3and the exact sequence ( 1). Therefore, the bottom row is a surjective
map as well. When combined with ( 4), we see that the bottom row is in fact an isomorphism. This

The following lemma allows us to complete the proof of Theore mAvia Theorem 4.4.
Lemma 4.5. Letaandbbe ideals of OK. Ifp∤[R(a):K]·[R(b):K], thenp∤[R(lcm(a,b)):K].
Proof. Let us write a=/producttextpmi
i,b=/producttextpni
i, wherepiare distinct prime ideals of OK. Recall that K
is of class number 1. By the theory of complex multiplication , ifIis an ideal of OK, we have
Gal(R(I)/K) = Gal(K(E[I])/K)∼=(OK/I)×.
Thus, by the Chinese remainder theorem,

for alli. Aslcm(a,b) =/producttextpmax(mi,ni)
i , we deduce that
p∤/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(OK/lcm(a,b))×/vextendsingle/vextendsingle= [R(lcm(a,b)):K]. /square
We can now prove Theorem Afrom the introduction.
Theorem. LetKbe an imaginary quadratic ﬁeld of class number 1. Let pandqbe distinct primes
(≥5) which split in K. Letrbe a ﬁxed ideal of OKcoprime to pqsuch that ris a product of split
primes. Let F=R(rq)and write R(rq∞)ac/Ffor the anticyclotomic Zq-extension. Assume that
p∤[F:K]. Then, there exists an integer Nsuch that for all n≥N,
ordp(h(Fn)) = ord p(h(FN)).
Proof. LetE/Kbe a CM elliptic curve of conductor fsuch that all the prime divisors of fare split
inKbut the prime divisors (which are ≥5) of[R(f):K]are not split in K. Such elliptic curves
exist as we have seen in § 2.
Letrbe any ideal of OKandp,qbe two distinct primes satisfying the hypotheses in the stat ement
of the theorem. Set g= lcm(f,r)and deﬁneF=R(gq). By assumption, p∤[R(rq):K]and we have
chosen our auxiliary CM elliptic curve so that p∤[R(f):K]. Thus, it follows from Lemma 4.5that
p∤[R(gq):K]. Furthermore, both fandrare only divisible by split primes. Therefore, Theorem 4.4
holds for the ideal g.
Sincep∤[Fn:Fn]andp∤[Fn+1:Fn]for alln≥0, we have
A(Fn)֒→A(Fn), A(Fn)֒→A(Fn+1).
Theorem 4.4asserts that ordp(h(Fn))stabilizes as n→ ∞. Hence, the same is true for ordp(h(Fn)).

5.Asymptotic growth of fine Selmer groups of abelian varieties
5.1.Deﬁnition of ﬁne Selmer groups. SupposeFis a number ﬁeld. Throughout, A/Fis a ﬁxed
abelian variety. We ﬁx a ﬁnite set Sof primes of Fcontainingp, the primes dividing the conductor
ofA, as well as the Archimedean primes. We write Sfto denote the set of ﬁnite primes. Denote
byFS, the maximal algebraic extension of Funramiﬁed outside S. For every (possibly inﬁnite)
extensionLofFcontained in FS, writeGS(L) = Gal/parenleftbig
FS/L/parenrightbig
. WriteS(L)for the set of primes of
LaboveS. IfLis a ﬁnite extension of Fandwis a place of L, we writeLwfor its completion at
w; whenL/Fis inﬁnite, it is the union of completions of all ﬁnite sub-ex tensions of L.
Deﬁnition 5.1. LetL/Fbe an algebraic extension. The p-primary ﬁne Selmer group of AoverL
is deﬁned as
Sel0(A/L) = ker
H1/parenleftbig
GS(L),A[p∞]/parenrightbig
→/circleplusdisplay
v∈SH1/parenleftbig
Lv,A[p∞]/parenrightbig
.
Similarly, the p-ﬁne Selmer group of AoverLis deﬁned as
Sel0(A[p]/L) = ker
H1/parenleftbig
GS(L),A[p]/parenrightbig
→/circleplusdisplay
v∈SH1/parenleftbig
Lv,A[p]/parenrightbig
.
Note that Sel0(A/L)is independent of the choice of S, whereas the deﬁnition of Sel0(A[p]/L)
depends on S; see for example [ LM16 , Lemma 4.1 and p. 86]. Since our main result concerns
Sel0(A/L), we suppress Sfrom the notation of Sel0(A[p]/L)for simplicity.
It is easy to observe that if F∞/Fis an inﬁnite extension,

where the inductive limits are taken with respect to the rest riction maps and Lruns over all ﬁnite
extensions of Fcontained in F∞. Next, we deﬁne the notion of p-rank of an abelian group G.10 D. KUNDU AND A. LEI

5.2.Growth of ﬁne Selmer groups in Zq-extensions. In this section, we prove the following
theorem which essentially says that the p-part of the class group and the p-primary ﬁne Selmer group
have similar growth behaviour in Zq-extensions. Our result is motivated by [ LM16 , Section 5].
Theorem 5.3. LetAbe ad-dimensional abelian variety deﬁned over a number ﬁeld F. LetS(F)
be a ﬁnite set of primes in Fconsisting precisely of the primes above q, the primes of bad reduction
ofA, and the Archimedean primes. Let F∞/Fbe a ﬁxed Zqextension such that primes in Sf(F)
are ﬁnitely decomposed in F∞/Fand suppose [Fn:F] =qn. Further suppose that A[p]⊆A(F).

IfA[p]⊆A(F), then the action of GFonA[p]is trivial. Let A∨be the dual abelian variety. The
action on the dual representation, A∨[p]is also trivial. This tells us that A∨[p]⊆A∨(F). Therefore,
Theorem 5.3allows us to deduce the following result.
Corollary 5.4. With the same hypothesis as in Theorem 5.3

To prove Theorem 5.3, we need a few lemmas.
Lemma 5.5. Consider the following short exact sequence of co-ﬁnitely ge nerated abelian groups
P→Q→R→S.
Then,/vextendsingle/vextendsinglerp(Q)−rp(R)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤2rp(P)+rp(S).
Proof. See [LM16 , Lemma 3.2]. /square
Lemma 5.6. LetF∞be anyZq-extension of Fsuch that all the primes in Sf(F)are ﬁnitely
decomposed. Let Fnbe the subﬁeld of F∞such that [Fn:F] =qn. Then
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglerp/parenleftbig
Cl(Fn)/parenrightbig
−rp/parenleftbig
ClS(Fn)/parenrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=O(1).
Proof. For eachFn, we writeSf(Fn)for the set of ﬁnite primes of FnaboveSf. For eachn, we have
the following exact sequence
Z|Sf(Fn)|−→Cl(Fn)αn− − →ClS(Fn)−→0
(see [NSW08 , Lemma 10.3.12]). Since the class group is always ﬁnite, it f ollows that ker(αn)is ﬁnite.
Also,rp/parenleftbig

Lemma 5.7. LetF∞/Fbe aZq-extension and let Fnbe the subﬁeld of F∞such that [Fn:F] =qn.
LetAbe an abelian variety deﬁned over F. Suppose that all primes of Sf(F)are ﬁnitely decomposed

Proof. Consider the commutative diagram

vn∈S(Fn)H1(Fn,vn, A[p∞])[p].
Bothfnandγnare surjective. Since A[p]⊂A(Fn), the kernel of these maps are given by
ker(fn) =A(Fn)[p∞]/slashbig
p≃/parenleftbig

ker(γn) =/circleplusdisplay
vn∈S(Fn)A(Fn,vn)[p∞]/slashbig

where the last isomorphism follows from our assumption that pis odd.
Observe that rp/parenleftbig
ker(sn)/parenrightbig

ker(fn)/parenrightbig
= 2dand thatrp/parenleftbig
ker(γn)/parenrightbig
= 2d/vextendsingle/vextendsingleSf(Fn)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. By hypoth-
esis,Sf(Fn)is bounded as nvaries. It follows from the snake lemma that both rp/parenleftbig
ker(sn)/parenrightbig
and
rp/parenleftbig
coker(sn)/parenrightbig
are ﬁnite and bounded. Applying Lemma 5.5to the following exact sequence
0→ker(sn)→Sel0(A[p]/Fn)→Sel0(A/Fn)[p]→coker(sn)→0
completes the proof. /square
Proof of Theorem 5.3.By hypothesis, A[p]⊆A(F). Therefore, A[p]≃(Z/p)2d. We have
H1/parenleftbig
GS(Fn), A[p]/parenrightbig
= Hom/parenleftbig
GS(Fn), A[p]/parenrightbig
.
There are similar identiﬁcations for the local cohomology g roups. Thus,
Sel0/parenleftbig
A[p]/Fn/parenrightbig
≃Hom/parenleftbig
ClS(Fn),A[p]/parenrightbig
≃ClS(Fn)[p]2d
as abelian groups. Therefore,
rp/parenleftBig
Sel0/parenleftbig
A[p]/Fn/parenrightbig/parenrightBig
= 2drp/parenleftbig
ClS(Fn)/parenrightbig
.
The theorem now follows from Lemmas 5.6and5.7. /square
Letpenbe the largest power of pthat divides the class number of Fn. Ifenis bounded then it
follows (trivially) that the p-rank is bounded. Thus, the following corollary is immediat e.
Corollary 5.8. Letp/\egatio\slash=q. LetF/Qbe any ﬁnite extension of QandF∞/Fbe anyZq-extension of
F. Letpenbe the exact power of pdividing the class number of the n-th intermediate ﬁeld Fn. Let
A/Fbe an abelian variety such that A[p]⊆A(F). Ifenis bounded as n→ ∞, thenrp/parenleftBig
Sel0/parenleftbig
A/Fn/parenrightbig/parenrightBig
is bounded independently of n.
In addition to Theorem A, there are some other results in the literature where it is kn own that
thep-part of the class group stabilizes in a Zq-extension (when p,qare distinct primes). These were
discussed brieﬂy in the introduction and are recorded here m ore precisely.
(1) ([Was78 , Theorem]) Let F/Qbe an abelian extension of QandF∞/Fbe the cyclotomic
Zq-extension of F. Ifpenbe the exact power of pdividing the class number of the n-th
intermediate ﬁeld Fn, thenenis bounded as n→ ∞.
(2) ([Lam15 , Theorem 7.10]) Let p,qbe ﬁxed odd distinct primes both ≥5,Kbe an imaginary
quadratic ﬁeld of class number 1 where pandqsplit, andE/Kbe an elliptic curves with CM
byOKand good reduction at p,q. LetK∞be theZqextensions of Kwhich is unramiﬁed
outsideq(resp.q). Letgbe a ﬁxed ideal of OKsuch that it is coprime to pqandF=R(gq)
is of degree prime-to- poverF. Then, the p-part of the class number stabilizes in FK∞=
R(gq∞). However, since pis assumed to be unramiﬁed in Finloc. cit. , the hypothesis
A[p]⊆A(F)in Theorem 5.3is unlikely to hold. The same can be said regarding the settin g
studied in Theorem A.12 D. KUNDU AND A. LEI
Theorem 5.9. With notation as above, suppose that the p-rank of the ﬁne Selmer group, denoted by
rp/parenleftbig
Sel0(A/Fn)/parenrightbig
stabilizes in a Zq-extension of F. Then there exists n≥0, such that for all m≥n,
the restriction map induces an isomorphism
Sel0(A/Fn)≃Sel0(A/Fm).
Proof. The following argument is similar to the one presented in [ Lam14 , p. 15], where instead
of classical Selmer groups, we consider ﬁne Selmer groups. C onsider the extension Fm/Fn. Then
[Fm:Fn] =qm−n=t(say). The restriction map
Gal/parenleftBig
F/Fn/parenrightBig
−→Gal/parenleftBig
F/Fm/parenrightBig
induces the restriction homomorphism
res:Sel0(A/Fn)−→Sel0(A/Fm).
Sincegcd(q,p) = 1, this maps is an injection. Moreover, we have
Sel0(A/Fn)res− − →Sel0(A/Fm)cores− −− →Sel0(A/Fn)t−1
− − →Sel0(A/Fn)
wherecores◦res = t . The composition res◦cores◦t−1is the identity map; thus, the exact sequence
0−→Sel0(A/Fn)−→Sel0(A/Fm)−→Sel0(A/Fm)/slashbig
Sel0(A/Fn)−→0
is split exact.
Let us write Sel0(A/Fn) = (Qp/Zp)sn⊕Tn, wheresn≥0andTnis a ﬁnitep-group. Then,
rp/parenleftbig
Sel0(A/Fn)/parenrightbig
=sn+rp(Tn).
The injection Sel0(A/Fn)֒→Sel0(A/Fm)tells us that sm≥sn. If thep-rankrp/parenleftbig
Sel0(A/Fn)/parenrightbig
eventually stabilizes it follows that snalso stabilizes. Denote the cokernel of the injection by Cm,n.
By duality, we have the short exact sequence
0→C∨
m,n→Zsm
p⊕T∨
m→Zsn
p⊕T∨
n→0.
Whensm=sn,C∨
m,nmust be ﬁnite. Consequently, the image of C∨
m,ninSel0(A/Fn)∨is contained
insideT∨
m. Furthermore, since the short exact sequence splits, we ded uce the isomorphism
Tm=Tn⊕Cm,n.
Assnstabilizes,rp(Tn)also stabilizes. Therefore, Cm,nhas to be 0eventually. /square
Theorem Bis now an immediate corollary of Theorems 5.3and5.9.
Corollary 5.10. Letp,qbe distinct odd primes. Let Fbe any number ﬁeld and A/Fbe an abelian
variety such that A[p]⊆A(F). LetF∞/Fbe aZq-extension where the primes above qand the
primes of bad reduction of Aare ﬁnitely decomposed. If the p-part of the class group stabilizes, i.e.,
there exists N≥0such that for all n≥N,
ordp(h(Fn)) = ord p(h(FN)),
then the growth of the p-primary ﬁne Selmer group stabilizes in the Zq-extension as well, i.e., there
exists an integer N′≥Nsuch that for all n≥N′, the restriction map induces an isomorphism
