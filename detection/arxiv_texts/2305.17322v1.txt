Discrete time crystal is a class of nonequilibrium quantum systems exhibiting subharmonic re-
sponses to external periodic driving. Here we propose a class of discrete time crystals enforced by
nonsymmorphic dynamical symmetry. We start with a system with nonsymmorphic dynamical sym-
metry, in which the instantaneous eigenstates become Möbius twisted, hence doubling the period of
the instantaneous state. The exact solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation shows that
the system spontaneously exhibits a period extension without undergoing quantum superposition
states for a series of specific evolution frequencies or in the limit of long evolution period. Moreover,
in such case the system gains a πBerry phase after two periods’ evolution. Finally, we show that
the subharmonic response is stable even when many-body interactions are introduced, indicating a
DTC phase in the thermodynamic limit.
Introduction Recently, the spontaneous breaking of
time translation symmetry has attracted tremendous at-
tentionandledtotheideaoftimecrystal[1]. Althoughit
has been shown that no system can spontaneously break
the continuous time translation symmetry [2], it is pos-
sible to break the discrete time translation symmetry in
Floquet quantum many-body systems [3–14]. This new
nonequilibrium phase has since been verified in a series
of experiments [15–22]. Subsequent studies in nonequi-
librium Floquet quantum systems further generalize to
incorporate both spatial and temporal dimensions, giv-
ing rise to a wide range of new phenomena, including the
space-time crystals [23–27]. In particular, it has been
shown that a nonsymmorphic symmetry can enforce en-
ergy band crossings and create a Möbius twist as well
as additional topological properties [27–33]. However, it
remains unclear what will happen when a system hosts
nonsymmorphic dynamical symmetry.
Here we propose a class of discrete time crystals
(DTCs) enforced by the nonsymmorphic dynamical sym-
metry. Werevealthedynamicalbehaviorofsuchsystems
by presenting an exact solution of the time-dependent
evolution of a two-level system. The instantaneous eigen-
states of the system are Möbius twisted when the non-
symmorphic dynamical symmetry is present. The exact
time-dependent solution shows that the quantum states
of the system exhibit evolution along the twisted instan-
taneous state so that period of the states is doubled to
that of the system Hamiltonian when the ratio between
the width of the instantaneous energy band to the evo-
lution frequency of the system’s Hamiltonian equals a
set of discrete values, or when the system evolves in the
long-period limit. Besides, we find that the system has a
nontrivial topology with a half-integer winding number
and a πBerry phase in two cycles of evolution. Also, we
explore the system’s stability in the presence of many-
body interactions and show the robustness of this classof DTCs. The exact solution provides an explicit evi-
dence to support the spontaneous breaking of the time
translation symmetry in discrete time crystals.

cent balls) and go to another instantaneous state after one
period evolution.
Model with a Möbius twist in instantaneous state The
nonsymmorphic dynamical symmetry operation repre-
sentsauniquecategoryofsymmetryoperationsthatinte-
grates both spatial transformations and non-trivial time
translation operations, which cannot be performed inde-
pendently. When nonsymmorphic symmetry is incorpo-
rated, the resulting extension of the symmetry group ex-
hibits topologically non-trivial properties, leading to in-
triguing characteristics in the group representations. In
the realm of group representation theory, the instanta-
neous eigenstate of the system adheres to the irreducible
representation of the symmetry group, while the Hamil-
tonian aligns with the induced representation of the non-
symmorphic symmetry. When the system exhibits non-arXiv:2305.17322v1  [quant-ph]  27 May 20232
symmorphic symmetry, the period of the irreducible rep-
resentation does not consistently align with the period of
the induced representation. Consequently, this inconsis-
tency generates a mismatch between the periods of the
instantaneous state and the Hamiltonian.
Specifically, we start with a time-dependent two-level
Hamiltonian with the dynamical glide symmetry [29],
H0(t) =1
2ℏΩ sin( ωt)σx+ℏΩ sin2(ωt
2)σy,(1)
where σi(i=x, y, z) are the Pauli matrices. The Hamil-
tonian has a period of T=2π
ω. At time t, the instan-
taneous eigenstates are ϕχ(t) =1√
2[χe−iωt/2,1]T(Tin-
dicating the transpose), with χ=±1. The correspond-
ing energy eigenvalues are Eχ(t) =χℏΩ sin( ωt/2). The
model possesses a nonsymmorphic dynamical symmetry
˜g, the square of which will be a time translation symme-
try with one period. The matrix representation of ˜gin
the basis of the two-level system is the reduced represen-
tation of the whole group and has the following form
G(t) =0e−iωt
1 0
. (2)
As a result, the Hamiltonian commutes with G(t),
[H(t), G(t)] = 0. Because G(t)is the induced repre-
sentation, it has the same period Tas the Hamiltonian,
G(t+T) = G(t). Furthermore, G2(t) = e−iωtis the
irreducible representation of the time translation sym-
metry with a period T. Consequently, the eigenvalues
ofG(t)aregχ(t) =χe−iωt/2. The corresponding eigen-
states are the instantaneous eigenstates of the system
ϕχ(t). The eigenvalues gχ(t)are in the irreducible repre-
sentations of the extended symmetry group whose period
is twice the system’s period. In addition, it has the swap-
ping property within one period as gχ(t+T) =g−χ(t)
andgχ(t+ 2T) =gχ(t). The corresponding eigenstates
ϕχ(t)share the same properties. The swapping property
of the eigenvalues and eigenstates is a manifestation of
the group monodromy. It directly illustrates the peri-
odic extension by introducing the nonsymmorphic sym-
metry. Another consequence of this period mismatch is
that the instantaneous eigenstates of the system auto-
matically become Möbius twisted. Figure 1 illustrates
how the Möbius twist happens. The two colored lines
represent the two eigenstates of the symmetry operator
G(t), which are also the instantaneous eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian. After one cycle of evolution, the two eigen-
states will swap. Since the instantaneous eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian still host the discrete time translation
symmetry, it is forced to undergo a symmetry-enforced
crossingintheevolutionprocess. Thetwoeigenstatesare
Möbius twisted at t=Tsuch that they only come back
to themselves after a two-period evolution, matching the
period of the irreducible representation of the symmetry
group.Besides period doubling in the two-level system with a
dynamical glide symmetry, systems with other nonsym-
morphic symmetries can also have other forms of period
extension. For example, a dynamical screw symmetry in
multi-level systems allows the period extension of more
than two [34].
Exact solution and DTC The exact solution
Ψ(t)of the time-dependent Hamiltonian in Eq. (1)
can be obtained by solving the time-dependent
Schrödinger equation, iℏ∂tΨ(t) = H0(t)Ψ(t). In
the basis of the instantaneous eigenstates ϕχ(t),
an ansatz for the time-dependent solution is
Ψ(t) =P
χcχ(t) exph

ϕχ(t),where
cχ(t)are two time-dependent coefficients. Substituting
the wave function into the time-dependent Schrödinger
equation, we find that cχ(t)satisfies

xcχ−iχαsin(2x)∂xcχ+cχ= 0, (3)
where x=ωt

ω.Note that cχ(t)depend on
χ,α, and x. We denote the initial state as Ψ(0) =P
χcχ(0)ϕχ(0)with c(x)≡(c+(x), c−(x))T. The solu-
tions for cχ(t)are found as follows:
c(x) =H+

Eq. (3) requires that Hχ

c(α, x)∗. Assum-
ing the initial state is the eigenstate of σxwith eigen-
value χ= +1, i.e., c+(0) = 1 andc−(0) = 0 , we
have c+(x) =H+
c(α, x)andc−(x) =−isinxH−
c(−α, x).
The wave function normalization further requires that
|H+
c(α, x)|2+ sin2(x)|H−
c(α, x)2= 1.
The solution in Eq. (4) reveals a subharmonic behav-
ior of dynamical evolution to the H(t)at a series of the
specific ratio α, i.e.,
Ψ(t+ 2T) =−Ψ(t), (6)
which is a hallmark feature of a DTC. Although the in-
stantaneous eigenstates are Möbius twisted and only re-
turn to themselves after 2T, the quench dynamics start-
ing from a generic initial state usually does not follow
the same behavior. To analyze this question, we intro-
duce the time evolution operator U(t), which satisfies
Ψ(t) = U(t)Ψ(0). By comparing the initial condition
cχ(0) = ϕ†
χ(0)Ψ(0)with the exact solution in Eq. (4), we
can obtain the general expression for the time evolution
operator U(t)[34]. Consider the initial state ϕ+(0). Af-

Hence, we can write H+

αn≃2nπ−π
2andθn≃π
αn. Consequently, we have
c±(π
2) = exp[ ±iθn]c±(0), indicating that the coefficients
gain extra phases in one period of evolution. This result
shows that the state does not return to the initial one af-
ter one period. In this case, the time evolution operator
has the form of
Un(T) =−iσze−iσx(αn
2−θn)(7)
for specific values of α=αn. For t= 2T, it follows that
Un(2T) =−1. Thus, after a two-period evolution, the
quantum state will return to its initial state, and gains
aπBerry phase as shown in Eq. (6). This manifests the
presence of the DTC.

If the initial state is one of the eigenstates of σx, say
ϕ+(0), the state will mainly evolve into the other eigen-
state ϕ−(0), andtheprobabilitytostayinthestate ϕ+(0)
is just ρ(T). Interestingly, the energy crossing here inval-
idates the adiabatic theorem. Furthermore, after a two-
period evolution, we have U(2T)≃ −1. In this limit,
the system is still approximately a DTC even if αis not
equal to αn.
To illustrate the periodicity of the evolution of the
quantum state, we project the state Ψ(t=nT)≡
U(nT)Ψ(0)onto the two basis states ϕχ(0), where nis
a positive integer. We denote the two resulting projec-
tion parameters as a±(n) =|⟨ϕ±(0)|Ψ(nT)⟩|, which sat-
isfies a2
+(n) +a2
−(n) = 1because of the wave function
normalization. Consequently, the points (a+(n), a−(n))
should all locate on a quarter circle with a unit radius.
The results for different values of αand the initial states
are plotted in Fig. 3. For general αand initial states,
the time evolution of the state does not exhibit any pe-
riodicity since all quantum states will be visited as n
increases. The points (a+(n), a−(n))are expected to fill
the entire quarter circle, indicating ergodicity for an ar-
bitrary initial state as shown in Fig. 3(a). We also find
that there are limitations to the ergodicity because a por-
tion of states near the axis will not be visited for some
specific initial states and the value of αafter a large
number nperiods of evolution, as shown in Fig. 3(b).
However, for α=αn, we note that Ψ(t=nT)just
have two states: Ψ(t=nT) =±Ψ(0)for an even n,
andΨ(t=nT) =±U(T)Ψ(0)for an odd n. The state
Ψ(t=nT)just bounces back and forth between Ψ(0)
andU(T)Ψ(0), as shown in Fig. 3(c). The period of the
state becomes 2T, indicating the formation of a DTC.
If the initial state happens to be one of the eigenstates
ofU(T), we have U(T)Ψ(0)∝Ψ(0). The evolution pe-
riod is just the same as that of the Hamiltonian. In this
case, the time translation symmetry is respected. For
αslightly deviating from the αnorα≫1, as shown in
Fig. 3(d), the systemapproximatelykeeps the two-period
oscillation for a relatively long time.

With a large α≫1, the dynamical phase factor
e−iαsin2ωt
4prompts rapid oscillation in the observable
⟨σx(t)⟩. Furthermore, multiple peaks emerge in the
Fourier spectrum of ⟨σx(t)⟩. Thus no time translation
symmetry is respected in this case.
We demonstrate that incorporating many-body inter-
actions can stabilize the subharmonic response, thereby
achievingaprethermalDTC.ThisprethermalDTCisex-
pected to endure in the thermodynamic limit and exhibit
robustness against perturbations and imperfect single-
spin driving fields. Specifically, we consider a spin chain
by comprising multiple identical Floquet two-level spin
system with uniform nearest-neighbor Ising couplings.
The Hamiltonian can be expressed as
H(t) =H0(t) +JX
iσi
µσi+1
µ, (10)
with H0(t)given by Eq. (1). Here Jrepresents the
Ising interaction between nearest-neighbor sites, σi
µde-
notes the spin operator of the i-th site, and µtakes
the values of x, y,orz. We assume that the interaction
strength Jis considerably smaller than the driving term
and system’s frequencies, such that |J| ≪ℏω. This in-
teraction induces decoherence and thermalization of the
Floquet system [37, 38]. If the system is initialized in
one of the instantaneous eigenstates of H0(t), decoher-ence among subsystems suppresses the rapid oscillation
caused by off-diagonal terms, resulting in a smoother os-
cillation pattern. To demonstrate the interaction’s im-
pact, we assess the average value of σi
xfor all sites, i.e.,
⟨mx(t)⟩=1
NP
i⟨σi
x(t)⟩,and display the oscillation of
⟨mx(t)⟩over the initial 40periods. Considering Ising in-
teractionsin the µ=xdirection, we find that the model
exhibits a persistent oscillation with a 2Tperiod, even
when αdeviates from αn. The DTC reinforced by non-
symmorphic symmetry is resilient to various initial states
and site-resolved measurements [34]. The oscillation’s
Fourier spectrum also presents an isolated peak atω
2in
Fig. 4(b). This substantiates explicitly the existence of
the DTC phase in the presence of the interaction. To
further verify that the system constitutes a prethermal
DTC, we carry out a finite-size scaling of ⟨mx(t)⟩at
stroboscopic time t=nT(nis an integer), defined as
⟨mx(nT)⟩= (−1)nZ(n), with the initial state polarized
in the x-direction and present the results for different
systems’ size in Fig. 4(c). The calculated Z(n)show
that it drops to 0.8∼0.9and maintains for a while be-
fore starting to drop drastically to around zero, which
allows us to define the lifetime τ=ncTfor the DTC
with different parameters. The inset of Fig. 4(c) illus-
trates that the lifetime τgrows exponentially with the
system size L, with τ∼ebL, where bis a phenomeno-
logical parameter that depends on the system’s parame-
ters. This characteristic is a key feature of a prethermal
DTC with spontaneously broken symmetry [3]. Remark-
ably, the interaction preserves the DTC phase even when
the symmetry is slightly broken by a small perturbation
term. For comparison, we also present the lifetime and
finite-size scaling for α=α13in Fig. 4(d). It is noted
that the stability of ⟨mx(t)⟩and the lifetime of the DTC
are enhanced drastically. Thus the interacting multiple
Floquet spin system is a prethermal DTC for α=αn
and even for αdeviating slightly from αnin the case of
interaction.
Discussion In the previous section, we demonstrated
that nonsymmorphic symmetry enforces the instanta-
neous eigenstate into a Möbius twist, resulting in the
period-doubled evolution. This period extension is at-
tributed to the realization of a DTC. The Hamiltonian
in Eq. (1) possesses an additional chiral symmetry, de-
fined as Γ = σz,such that {Γ, H0}= 0. The topologi-
cal property of the system can be characterized by the
winding number, defined as ν=Rdk
2π(hy∂thx−hx∂thy),
if we decompose the Hamiltonian into Pauli matrices as
H0=h·σ.When the instantaneous energy bands exhibit
a single crossing, the winding number becomes a half-
integer [29]. This unique winding number is intimately
connected to the system’s period extension.
In contrast to gapped systems where the adiabatic the-
orem applies and the quantum state will always stay in
instantaneous eigenstate in evolution process, the quan-
tum state of the DTC with band crossing returns to its5

Berry phase when the frequency equals to certain val-
ues or in the long-period limit. Experimentally, quan-
tum simulation of our DTC proposal can be performed
using qubits in a quantum computer, such as quantum
superconducting circuits and nuclear magnetic resonance
systems [22, 39–41]. These systems enable spin manipu-
lation for arbitrary Hamiltonians. The period extension
can be directly observed by monitoring corresponding
observable quantities like spin polarization. Addition-
ally, the unique Berry phase in our model can also be
measured in these systems. By selecting an initial state
polarized in the x-direction, the πBerry phase can be
measured from the 2Tperiodic oscillation of ⟨σx⟩when
α=αnor in the long-period limit.
