ABSTRACT
Electron-capturesupernovae(EC-SNe)provideanalternativechannelforproducingneutronstars(NSs).Theyplayanimportant
role in the formation of double NS (DNS) systems and the chemical evolution of galaxies, and contribute to the NS mass
distribution in observations. It is generally believed that EC-SNe originate from 𝑒-captures on24Mgand20Nein the massive
degenerate oxygen-neon (ONe) cores with masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit ( 𝑀Ch). However, the origin of EC-SNe is
still uncertain. In this paper, we systematically studied the EC-SNe in NS+He star systems by considering the explosive oxygen
burningthatmayoccurinthenear- 𝑀ChONecore.WeprovidedtheinitialparameterspacesforproducingEC-SNeintheinitial

with metallicity. Then, by considering NS kicks added to the newborn NS, we investigated the properties of the formed DNS
systems after the He star companions collapse into NSs, such as the orbital periods, eccentricities and spin periods of recycle
pulsars ( 𝑃spin), etc. The results show that most of the observed DNS systems can be produced by NS kicks of ≲50 km s−1. In
addition, we found that NSs could accrete more material if the residual H envelope on the He star companions is considered,
which can form the mildly recycled pulsars ( 𝑃spin∼20ms) in DNS systems.
Key words: binaries: close – stars: evolution – pulsars: general – supernovae: general.
1 INTRODUCTION
Electron-capturesupernovae(EC-SNe)areinducedbythe 𝑒-capture
on24Mgand20Nein the strongly degenerate oxygen-neon (ONe)
cores with masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit ( 𝑀Ch; Nomoto
1987). It is generally suggested that the cores will eventually col-
lapseintoneutronstars(NSs)afterundergoingEC-SNe(e.g.Nomoto
1984;Siess2007;Jonesetal.2013;Dohertyetal.2015;Taurisetal.
2015;Tauris&vandenHeuvel2023).Becauseoftherelativelysteep
density gradient in the outer cores, EC-SNe are expected to expe-
rience a prompt or fast explosion (see Podsiadlowski et al. 2004).
Thus they may have relatively low explosion energies ( ∼1050erg,
Kitaura et al. 2006), small amounts of56Ni(∼0.002−0.015 M⊙,
Kitaura et al. 2006; Wanajo et al. 2009), and low-velocity kicks
(≲100 km s−1, Gessner & Janka 2018; Stockinger et al. 2020). In

ticellaetal.2009)andSN2018zd(Hiramatsuetal.2021).Theyare
also potential sources for the 𝑟-process, which can synthesize heavy
elements and contribute to the chemical evolution of galaxies (Ning
et al. 2007). In addition, Schwab et al. (2010) studied the masses of
14 well-measured NSs, and found that the mass distribution of NSs
may be bimodal, in which the lower mass peak ( ∼1.25 M⊙) may
arise from EC-SNe.
Double neutron star (DNS) systems are important potential grav-
itational wave sources, which can be formed in NS+He star systems
after the He star companions undergo EC-SNe or iron core collapse

observed DNS systems span a wide range from 0.1d to45.0d, the
orbital eccentricities range from 0.064to0.828, and the component
masses mainly range from 1.1−1.5 M⊙. The observed features of
DNSsareimportantforexploringtheirorigin(e.g.Taurisetal.2017;
Shao&Li2018;Andrews&Mandel2019).ItseemsthatmostDNS

EC-SNchannelmayprovideanimportantcontributiontotheforma-
tionofDNSbinaries.However,therearestillsomeuncertaintiesfor
theoriginofEC-SNe,althoughtheyplayavitalroleintheformation
of DNS binaries and the NS mass distribution in observations (e.g.
Tauris et al. 2015; Jones et al. 2016; Chanlaridis et al. 2022).
Manyworkshavebeendevotedtothestudyoftheinitialmassrange
for producing EC-SNe, which can be used in population synthesis
studies (e.g. Nomoto 1984; Poelarends 2007; Doherty et al. 2015;
Tauris et al. 2015; Han et al. 2020). It is generally believed that
the initial masses of single main-sequence stars for producing EC-
SNe are in the range of ∼8−10 M⊙for solar metallicity, and
this mass range is metallicity dependent (see e.g. Doherty et al.
2017). In the classic picture, the lower limit of metal core mass
for producing EC-SNe is ∼1.37 M⊙(e.g. Nomoto 1984; Takahashi
et al. 2013), and the upper limit of metal core mass is ∼1.43 M⊙
(Tauris et al. 2015). For the metal cores with masses less than ∼
1.37 M⊙, stars will evolve into ONe white dwarfs (WDs). For the
metalcoreswithmasseslargerthan ∼1.43 M⊙,thestarswillcollapse
into NSs through Fe CC-SNe. For the metal cores with masses of
1.37−1.43 M⊙, the oxygen deflagration is initiated in the center
duetotheheatingof 𝑒-captureon20Ne.Subsequently,asthecentral
temperature rises steeply, nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) will
be achieved when temperature exceeds 5×109K. The 𝑒-capture
reactions in NSE region accelerate core contraction, resulting in the
formationofNSseventuallyifthe 𝑒-capturerateexceedsthenuclear
burning rate.
However, Guo et al. (2023, hereafter Paper I) recently found that
explosive oxygen burning may be triggered after He stars develop
ONe cores with masses close to 𝑀Ch, and then the He stars may
explode as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) instead of collapsing into
NSs (see also Antoniadis et al. 2020; Chanlaridis et al. 2022). It is
interestingtoseehowthesenewresultsaffecttheevolutionofbinary
NSs resulting from EC-SNe. Accordingly, we will explore the for-
mation of the EC-SNe in NS+He star binaries, and the properties of
DNSs originating from the EC-SN channel. The basic method and
assumptions for the binary evolution simulations are introduced in
Section2.ThesimulationresultsforEC-SNeinNS+Hestarbinaries
are presented in Section 3. We show the investigation of the prop-
erties of DNSs produced by EC-SNe in Section 4. Finally, we give
discussions in Section 5 and a summary in Section 6.
2 NUMERICAL METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS
We performed detailed binary evolution calculations of NS+He star
systemsbyusingthestellarevolutioncodeModulesforExperiments
in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA, version 10398; see Paxton et al.
2018), in which the initial NS mass ( 𝑀i
NS) is set to be 1.35 M⊙.
Instead of solving the stellar structure equations of NSs, we assume
that NSs to be point masses. In the present work, we constructed
zero-agemain-sequence(ZAMS)Hestarmodelsbasedonsuitecase
create_zams.Wemainlyexploredtheparameterspaceforproducing
EC-SNe,wheretheinitialHestarmass( 𝑀i
He)rangesfrom∼2.4 M⊙
to3.0 M⊙witharesolutionof 0.01 M⊙,andtheinitialorbitalperiod
(𝑃i
orb) ranges from∼0.07d to10d withΔlog𝑃i
orb=0.5.
Duringthebinaryevolution,theNSstartstoaccretematerialfromHe star companion once the companion fills its Roche lobe. The
scheme proposed by Kolb & Ritter (1990) is adpoted to compute
the mass-transfer rate (see also the Appendix in Ge et al. 2010),
and the fraction of mass lost from the vicinity of the NS is set
to be 0.5. Accordingly, the mass increase rate of NSs is ¤𝑀NS=
min(0.5×¤𝑀tran,¤𝑀Edd), in which¤𝑀Edd=3×10−8M⊙yr−1is the
Eddington accretion rate and ¤𝑀tranis the mass-transfer rate (e.g.
Podsiadlowski et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021). In
this work, the simulated mass-transfer rates are often 3−4orders
of magnitude larger than ¤𝑀Eddand therefore limited by ¤𝑀Edd(e.g.
Tauris et al. 2015; Paper I). We assume that the excess material
(¤𝑀tran−¤𝑀NS) isejected fromthe vicinityof theNS, carrying away
thespecificorbitalangularmomentumoftheaccretingNS(e.g.Dewi
et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2022).
During the evolution of He star companions, we adopted the
‘Dutch’ prescription with a scaling factor of 1.0as the stellar wind
mass-loss mechanism (e.g. Glebbeek et al. 2009; Antoniadis et al.
2020). We used Type 2 Rosseland mean opacity tables provided by
Iglesias & Rogers (1996), which can be applied to the enhanced
carbon-oxygen caused by He-burning. The nuclear reaction net-
work is coupled by 43isotopes from1H−58Ni, including NeNa
and MgAl cycles, Urca processes of23Na⇌23Ne,23Ne⇌23F,
25Mg⇌25Naand25Na⇌25Ne, and the 𝑒-capture chains, i.e.
24Mg(𝑒−, 𝜈𝑒)24Na(𝑒−, 𝜈𝑒)24Neand20Ne(𝑒−, 𝜈𝑒)20F(𝑒−, 𝜈𝑒)20O.

tion,weadoptedtheHELMandPCequations-of-state(e.g.Timmes

the mass donor after the carbon burning stage. At this moment, the
ONe core is mainly composed of oxygen, neon, sodium and magne-
sium. Subsequently, neon is ignited off-center at mass coordinates
(𝑀c) of∼0.8 M⊙due to the temperature inversion caused by the
neutrino emission in the center of core (i.e. Ne-shell flash). From
Fig.3, it can be seen that the center reaches higher density and
temperature after each Ne-shell flash quenches (Jones et al. 2013).
Following a few Ne-shell flashes, the central density increases to
log10(𝜌c/g cm−3) ≈ 9.1, resulting in the initiation of Urca pro-
cesses. The central temperature decreases because of the Urca re-
actions. Meanwhile, the Urca reactions accelerate the contraction of
the metal core, thereby leading to higher central density.

the isotope20Ois produced in the center owing to the reactions of
20Ne(𝑒−, 𝜈𝑒)20F(𝑒−, 𝜈𝑒)20O. Meanwhile, a thick Si-rich mantle is
formed because of the Ne-shell flashes. At this moment, the final
mass of the He envelope is ∼8.2×10−4M⊙, thus the He lines are
not visible in the spectra after the core-collapse event (Hachinger
et al. 2012).
3.2 Parameter space for EC-SNe
By calculating a large number of NS+He star systems with different
𝑀i
Heand𝑃i
orb, we obtained the initial contours for producing EC-
SNe. Table1 lists the information about the evolution of NS+He
star binaries ( 𝑍=0.02) at the boundaries of the parameter space
for EC-SNe, in which the selected models correspond to the lowest
simulated masses (for the given initial orbital period) to produce
either Fe CC-SNe or EC-SNe. The metal core mass for EC-SNe
ranges from∼1.385 M⊙to1.43 M⊙. If the final core mass is lower
than∼1.385 M⊙,thentheexplosiveoxygenburningcanbetriggered
owing to the convective Urca process, resulting in that the He star
companions explode as SNe Ia eventually (see Paper I). If the final
core mass is larger than ∼1.43 M⊙, then the final fates of He star
companions are Fe CC-SNe.
Fig.5 shows 𝑇cversus 𝜌cfor three representative NS+He star
binaries which terminate their evolution as an SN Ia, an EC-SN and
an Fe CC-SN, respectively. For the model with 𝑀i
He=2.65 M⊙,
the He star companion develops a ∼1.378 M⊙ONe core, and the
explosive oxygen burning takes place owing to the convective Urca
process, resulting in the formation of an SN Ia (see Paper I). For
the model with 𝑀i
He=2.67 M⊙, the He star companion develops a
∼1.385 M⊙ONe core, and the He star will undergo EC-SN after
𝑒-capture on20Neoccurs. For the model with 𝑀i
He=3.0 M⊙, the
He star companion develops a ∼1.55 M⊙ONe core, and the Ne-
shell flash takes place at 𝑀c≈0.3 M⊙, which is closer to the center
than the model with a 2.67 M⊙He star companion. Fig.6 shows the

for a lower metallicity, the parameter spaces shifted to low-mass He
star companion. This is because lower metallicities result in weaker
stellar wind mass-loss and larger metal core for a given initial He
star mass (e.g. Chanlaridis et al. 2022; Aguilera-Dena et al. 2023).
Meanwhile, lower metallicities lead to smaller radii of He ZAMS
stars, thus the left boundaries of the parameter space shifts slightly
to shorter initial period (see also Wang & Han 2010).

4 DOUBLE NEUTRON STAR SYSTEMS
The simulations show that the He star companions in NS binaries
may explode as SNe Ia if the degenerate ONe core masses range
from∼1.335−1.385 M⊙(seePaperI).Meanwhile,theNSsspinup
duringthemass-accretionphase,resultingintheformationofisolated
mildly recycled pulsars after the He star companions experience SN
Ia explosions. If the ONe core masses are larger than ∼1.385 M⊙,
then the He star companions collapse into NSs through EC-SNe or
FeCC-SNe,whichmayresultintheformationofDNSsystems(e.g.
Taurisetal.2017;Kruckowetal.2018).Accordingly,wewillstudy
theDNSsystemsoriginatingfromtheEC-SNchannel,andcompare
our calculation results with observations.
4.1 The effects of SN explosions
It has been suggested that the eccentricity ( 𝑒) and the orbital period
ofNSbinarieswillbechangedafterthecompanionstarundergoesa

addedtothenewly-bornNS.TheorientationoftheNSkickvelocity
iscontrolledbytwoangles,i.e.theanglebetween 𝑉kandthepre-SN
orbital velocity ( 0≤𝜃≤180◦), and the positional angle of 𝑉kout
of the orbital plane ( −180◦< 𝜙≤180◦). Thus, the ratio of pre-SN
orbital separation ( 𝑎0) to the post-SN orbital separation ( 𝑎) can be
given by (e.g. Hills 1983; Dewi & Pols 2003; Shao & Li 2016)

Lines I, II and III are the regions where post-SN systems are located with relatively high probability, corresponding to 𝜃∼180◦,𝜃∼0and𝜙∼0,±180◦,
respectively. The red stars are the Galactic DNS systems in observations. The observed data of DNS binaries are taken from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue,
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat (version 1.71, November 2023; Manchester et al. 2005).
We assume that the NS mass is 1.35 M⊙. In our simulations, the
final companion star mass prior to SN ranges from ∼1.385 M⊙to
1.43 M⊙, thus we adopt an average value of 1.4 M⊙. Accordingly,
the pre-SN total mass is 2.75 M⊙. The ejected mass for EC-SNe
is still highly uncertain. Previous studies generally suggested that
the collapse of these objects can produce small ejected mass from
0.01−0.2 M⊙(e.g. Timmes et al. 1996; Kitaura et al. 2006; Fryer
etal.2012).Inthiswork,thevalueof Δ𝑀issettobe 0.08 M⊙(Shao
& Li 2018). The small value of Δ𝑀means that the properties of
post-SNbinariesaredominatedbythenatalNSkicks.Inaddition,it
has been suggested that EC-SNe may produce low NS kicks owing
tothefastexplosionsandrelativelylowexplosionenergies,whilethe

Kitauraetal.2006;Verbuntetal.2017;Janka2017;Gessner&Janka
2018; Stockinger et al. 2020). Tauris et al. (2015) suggested that the
amount of ejecta is extremely small for EC-SNe and low-mass Fe
CC-SNe,resultinginsmallNSkickslessthan ∼10 km s−1.Inaddi-
tion,simulationsofEC-SNeshowthattheexplosionenergyisabout
1050erg, which leads to the kick velocities lower than ∼50 km s−1
(e.g. Kitaura et al. 2006; Dessart et al. 2006; Beniamini & Piran
2016;Janka2017).Accordingly,weassumethat 𝑉k≤50 km s−1for
EC-SNe.
4.2 DNS systems in the 𝑃orb−𝑒diagram
Fig.8 shows the effect of NS kicks and pre-SN orbital period on
the distribution of post-SN systems in the 𝑃orb−𝑒diagram, where
we performed 2000cycles with randomly oriented NS kicks foreach pre-SN system. Obviously, larger 𝑉kand longer pre-SN orbital
period easily lead to higher post-SN eccentricity and longer post-
SN𝑃orb. We note that if the systems have short pre-SN 𝑃orb(≲
1d) and relatively low 𝑉k, then the post-SN 𝑃orbdoes not change
significantly.Additionally,thebinariesmaybedisruptediftheyhave
wide-orbits. For example, if a pre-SN binary has parameters with
(𝑉k, 𝑃orb)=(40 km s−1,40 d), then the disruption probability for
this system is 32%. Moreover, we found that the probability of the
post-SN system located in the minimum and maximum period is
relatively high, corresponding to 𝜃around 180◦and0, respectively.

features in this plot, identified as lines I, II, and III, trace the high
density regions of similar identification in Fig.8 (corresponding to
post-SNorbitalconfigurationsthatareweaklydependentonthekick
angles), when convolved with variations in the orbital period and
kick magnitude. It can be seen that the NS kicks ≲50 km s−1could
reproduce the most DNS systems, especially for the binaries with
relatively low eccentricities. For example, PSR J1755−2550(Ng
et al. 2015) is a DNS candidate with a long orbital ( 𝑃orb=9.7d)
and a low eccentricity ( 𝑒=0.09). Ng et al. (2018) suggested that

J1811−1736has a long orbital period ( 𝑃orb=18.8d) and the

J1811−1736can be produced by kicks of ∼50 km s−1, this source
may come from different formation channel because of the huge
gap at long periods and moderate eccentricities. In addition, kicks
lower than∼50 km s−1cannot account for three DNSs with high
eccentricity,i.e.PSRs J0509+3801,J1757−1854andJ1915+1606.

Table 2 shows the properties of Galactic DNS systems, as well as
their NS kick velocities and pre-SN orbital periods estimated in this
work. We found that the DNSs with short orbital periods and high

different pre-SN orbital periods and NS kicks. Their results indicate
that for relatively tight systems with 𝑃pre
orb≲1 d, all systems will
survive if the NS kicks are lower than 100 km s−1. Meanwhile, the
orbital periods of such tight systems does not change significantly
after the SN explosions, which is helpful for studying their pre-SN
properties.
4.4 DNS systems in the 𝑃orb−𝑃spindiagram

NSs in close X-ray binaries could be spun up during the mass-
accretion process (e.g. Alpar et al. 1982; Bhattacharya & van den
Heuvel 1991), and the minimum spin period of the recycled pulsars
can be expressed as (Tauris et al. 2012)4:
𝑃min
spin≈0.34×(Δ𝑀NS/M⊙)−3/4ms, (3)

that most of the transferred material is ejected from the binaries

Table 1, we can see that the accreted masses of NSs range from
2.0×10−4M⊙to2.0×10−3M⊙, corresponding to initial orbital
periods of 0.07−10d. This results in the formation of recycled
pulsars with 𝑃min

accompanied by the recycled pulsars with higher 𝑃spin, resulting
from the shorter duration of the mass-accretion phase (e.g. Tauris
et al. 2015; Paper I). The brown shaded regions indicate the effect
of NS kicks on the post-SN 𝑃orb. As shown in this figure, longer
𝑃pre

SNorbitalperiods.However,wenotethatthisresultshardlyexplain
the DNS systems with relatively rapidly spinning recycled pulsars
(𝑃spin≲30ms). For example, the DNS system PSR J 1946+2052
has a spin period of 17ms, which is lower than the minimum valuein our simulations ( ∼38ms, see Table 1). It has been suggested that
such mildly recycled pulsars may be caused by the super-Eddington
accretion, that is, Case BB RLOF allows first-born NS to accrete
material at mass-accretion rates of 2−3times¤𝑀Edd(e.g. Lazarus
et al. 2014; Tauris et al. 2017). In this work, we also provide a
possible explanation for the relatively low spin period of pulsars by
considering the residual H envelope on the surface of the He star
companion, see Section 4.4.2.
4.4.2 The effect of residual H envelope on 𝑃spin
It is generally believed that the NS+He star system that can form
DNS has gone through the common envelope (CE) phase, in which
the dynamic friction generated by the motion of NS inside the giant
star’s envelope leads to the loss of orbital angular momentum and
the ejection of the H-rich envelope (e.g. Paczynski 1976; Dewi &
Pols 2003; Ivanova et al. 2013; Tauris et al. 2017; Wei et al. 2023).
However, recent simulations suggest that a small amount of H shell
still remains on the surface of He star companion after CE ejection
(e.g. Fragos et al. 2019; Ge et al. 2022, 2024), which may affect
the evolution of NS+He star systems. Accordingly, we calculated
the evolution of three binaries taking into account the residual H
envelope.
We evolved a 11 M⊙MS star to the stage near the tip of red
supergiantphase,wherecentralheliumburninghasnotyetoccurred.
We then removed the envelope until its radius less than the roche
lobe radius, e.g. for binary with 𝑀i

the initial radius of companion star should be less than ∼0.63𝑅⊙.

Meanwhile, the mass of the remaining H envelope should be in the

can see that the accreted mass of NS increases several times if the
residual H envelope is assumed to remain on the surface of the He
star companion. Meanwhile, the residual H envelope can also affect
the final fate of the He star companion.
Fig.11 shows the effect of the residual H envelope on the mass-
transfer rate, in which the initial donor mass in both models is
2.73 M⊙(see sets 18 and 20 in Table 3). The He star with a H
envelope has a larger radius than the naked He star, causing it to fill
its Roche lobe more easily. It can be seen that the H envelope re-
sultsinalongerdurationofthemass-transferphase(Bauer&Kupfer

Inourdefaultmodels,weadoptedthe‘Dutch’stellarwindwithaeffi-

stellarwindefficienciesmaychangetheevolutionaryoutcomesofthe
He stars. To further explore the influence of stellar wind efficiencies
on the evolution of NS+He star systems, we computed four models
with a stellar wind efficiency of 0.1(see Table1). The most signifi-
cant effect is that lower wind efficiencies result in lower initial mass
of the He star companion for EC-SNe. In addition, we note that the

indicating that the EC-SN is likely to be classified as a Type Ic SN
(Hachinger et al. 2012). In addition, convective overshooting is also
an important physical process, which can result in higher effective
temperature/luminosity, longer HeMS lifetime and a larger convec-
tivecore(e.g.Yanetal.2016;Chanlaridisetal.2022).Inthepresent

However,byusingthegravitationalbindingenergyprovidedbyLat-
timer&Yahil(1989),Taurisetal.(2015)calculatedthegravitational
massesoftheNSremnants,andfoundthatabout 0.2 M⊙ofthemate-
rialcouldbeejectedwhentheHestarcompanionsundergoEC-SNe.
Accordingly, we calculated the distribution of post-SN systems in
the𝑃orb−𝑒diagram by assuming the ejected mass as 0.2 M⊙(see
Fig.A2). We found that higher ejected mass leads to a wider range
of eccentricity and the post-SN 𝑃orb, although the influence is not
significant. In addition, Tauris et al. (2017) suggested that post-SN
simulationsarealsolessdependentonthemassofthefirst-bornNS.
5.2 Comparison to previous studies
Tauris et al. (2015) studied the parameter spaces for CO WDs, ONe
WDs,EC-SNeandFeCC-SNeinNS+Hestarsystems.Theyassumed
that EC-SNe will be produced if final metal core masses range from
1.37 M⊙to1.43 M⊙. However, our previous work show that the He
star companions may explode as SNe Ia if the metal core masses
rangefrom∼1.335−1.385 M⊙.Thiscouldleadtoa 25%reduction
intheparameterspaceforproducingEC-SNe,whichonlyappliesfor
interactingHestarsinclosebinaries(PaperI).Kruckowetal.(2018)
studied the formation rate of DNSs by performing the binary pop-
ulation syntheses. Their simulation results show that more systems
can survive even if they experience Fe CC-SNe with larger kicks,
given that most systems are tightened by CE process prior to the
secondSNe.ForthesecondSNe,theratioofEC-SNetoFeCC-SNe
is∼0.2in all DNSs formed. Thus, the reduced EC-SN parameter
spacehasnosignificantimpactontheformationrateofDNSsowing
tothemuchsmallercontributionofEC-SNetothesecond-bornNSs.
In addition, by comparing with the results of Tauris et al. (2015),
wenotethattheremainingheliumenvelopemasscalculatedintheir
study is larger than that of this work, and their simulations show
thatEC-SNeinsomeNSbinariesmayappearasultra-strippedType
Ib SNe. This is because Tauris et al. (2015) stopped the code when
the ONe cores are formed, while we continued the calculation to a
laterevolutionstage,i.e.the 𝑒-captureon20Ne(seeFig.4).Wenote

final He envelope masses are lower than 0.06 M⊙for NS+He star
binaries with 𝑃i
orb≲10d, and such EC-SNe may be observed as
Type Ic SNe.
Shao & Li (2018) investigated the effect of the NS kicks on the
distributionofDNSsystemswithpopulationsynthesisstudies.They
suggested thatthe second-bornNSs inmost DNSsystems havekick
velocities less than 80 km s−1. Tauris et al. (2017) explored the pre-
SN characters of DNS systems, and obtained the distribution of
parametersofeachsource.Theirresultsindicatethatthekickvelocity
and pre-SN orbital period cover a wide range, and the peak values
of kick velocities for most of the observed DNS systems tend to
be less than∼50 km s−1(see their Figs 24−38). Previous studies
show that EC-SNe have explosion energies about ∼1050erg andlow ejected mass between 0.01−0.2 M⊙(e.g. Kitaura et al. 2006;
Dessart et al. 2006; Zha et al. 2022), which may lead to the small
NSkicks ≲50 km s−1oreven ≲10 km s−1(e.g.Janka2017;Tauris
etal.2017).Meanwhile,ourresultsshowthattheNSkickvelocities
of≲50 km s−1canproducemostobservedDNSsystems,indicating
that EC-SNe may play an important role in the formation of DNSs.
Janka(2017)studiedhowtheNSkickvelocitydependsontheex-
plosionenergy,ejectamass,NSmass,andotherrelevantparameters.
They found that massive metal cores tend to result in larger ejected
masses and higher explosion energies, and therefore higher NS kick
velocities. Meanwhile, Tauris et al. (2017) made statistics related to
the masses of the second-born NSs and the kick velocities. They
found that the second-born NSs with masses ≳1.33 M⊙are more
likely to have high kick velocities, and suggested that smaller NS
masses are preferentially accompanied by smaller NS kicks. Table2
lists the NS kick velocities estimated from this work and the masses
of the second-born NSs in observations. We also note that the DNS
systems with high second-born NS masses may originate from high
NS kicks (e.g. PSRs J 0509+3801and J 1757−1854).
Andrews & Mandel (2019) divided the observed DNSs into three
distinct subtypes according to the orbital characteristics: (1) DNSs
with tight orbits and low eccentricities, which can merge within the
Hubble time; (2) DNSs with wide orbits that cannot merge within
the Hubble time; (3) DNSs with tight orbits and high eccentricities.
Our theoretical results show that both subtypes (1) and (2) can be
reproduced by the NS kicks ≲50 km s−1. To explain the clustering
of DNSs in subtype (3), i.e. PSRs J0509+3801,J1757−1854and
J1915+1606,Andrews&Mandel(2019)suggestedthatiftheDNSs
are the product of isolated binary evolution, then the second-born
NSs must have a small natal kicks ≲25 km s−1and the pre-SN He
star masses narrowly distributed around 3.2 M⊙. In addition, they
also proposed that the DNSs in subtype (3) may originate from
dynamical formation channel, that is, the DNSs firstly formed in
globular cluster, and was then dynamically kicked into the Milky
Way field (see Phinney & Sigurdsson 1991).
PSR J 1952+2630is a mildly recycled 20.7ms pulsar orbiting
togetherwithamassiveWDcompanion( ≳0.93 M⊙),anditsorbital
periodis 9.4h(Lazarusetal.2014).Suchtightorbitindicatesthatthis
system has undergone CE evolution and form a NS+He star system,
and then the NS spins up through the Case BB RLOF. Lazarus
etal.(2014)suggestedthattherelativelyfastspinofthispulsarmay
becausedbythesuper-Eddingtonaccretionwithmass-accretionrate
between∼100−300percentof¤𝑀Edd.Accordingtooursimulations,
weconcludedthatsuchmildlyrecycledpulsar+WDsystemscanalso
be produced if the residual H envelope on the surface of He star
companion is considered.
5.3 Thermonuclear EC-SNe
Previous studies usually assumed that the 𝑒-capture on20Netakes
place if ONe cores have masses ≳1.37 M⊙, resulting in that the
ONe cores collapse into NS through EC-SNe (e.g. Nomoto 1984;
Taurisetal.2015;Dohertyetal.2015).However,byperformingthe
multidimensionalhydrodynamicsimulationsforoxygendeflagration
inONecoreswiththreedifferentcentralignitiondensities,Jonesetal.
(2016)foundthattheONecoresmaynotcollapseintoNSsifoxygen
deflagrationistriggeredatignitiondensity log10(𝜌c/g cm−3)≲10,
while∼0.1−1 M⊙of material will be ejected and leave bound
ONeFe WD remnants, called the thermonuclear EC-SNe (see also
Isernetal.1991;Kirsebometal.2019;Jonesetal.2019).Ontheother
hand,theONecoreswillcollapseintoNSsatrelativelyhighignition
density log10(𝜌c/g cm−3)≳10. Fig.3 shows that the explosive

oxygenburningoccursatcentraldensityof log10(𝜌c/g cm−3)∼9.8,
indicating that this NS+He star binaries may evolve into eccentric
pulsar+WD systems after SN explosions.
PSR J0453+1559is a DNS system candidate with 𝑃orb=4.07d
and𝑒=0.1125(Martinez et al. 2015). The mass of the recycled
pulsar and its companion are 1.559(5)M⊙and1.174(4)M⊙, re-
spectively. However, it is unclear whether the companion is a NS or
a WD. The mass of its companion is significantly lower than that of
thesecond-bornNSsinotherDNSsystems,indicatingthatthecom-
panionismorelikelynotaNS.Ontheotherhand,theeccentricityof
0.1125is high for normal NS+WD systems. In view of this, Tauris
& Janka (2019) used the thermonuclear EC-SN channel to explain
the formation of this system, and they found that PSR J0453+1559
maybeproducedbyakickvelocityfrom ∼70 km s−1to100 km s−1.
More numerical simulations and observations about thermonuclear
EC-SNe are needed to verify this scenario.
6 SUMMARY
Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we systematically studied
EC-SNe in NS+He star binaries with 𝑃i
orb<10d. In our simula-
tions,the 𝑒-captureson20NearetriggerediftheHestarcompanions
develophighlydegenerateONecoreswithmassesfrom ∼1.385 M⊙
to1.43 M⊙. SNe Ia are produced if the core masses ≲1.385 M⊙,
owingtotheexplosiveoxygenburningcausedbytheconvectiveUrca
process.ThefinalfatesoftheHestarswillbeFeCC-SNeifthecore
masses ≳1.43 M⊙. We calculated a series of NS+He star binaries
and obtained initial parameter spaces for producing EC-SNe in the
log𝑃i
orb−𝑀i
Hediagram,andfoundthathighermetallicitycanresult
in higher 𝑀i
Heand minimum 𝑃i
orbfor EC-SNe.
By considering the kicks added to the second-born NS, we then
explored the properties of the formed DNS systems after the He
star companions collapse into NSs through EC-SNe, such as the
post-SN orbital period, eccentricity and the spin period of recycle
pulsar,etc.Basedonthecomparisonbetweennumericalsimulations
and observations, we found that the majority of the observed DNS
systemscanbeexplainedbytheNSkicksof ≲50 km s−1,indicating
thattheEC-SNchannelmayplayanimportantroleintheformation
of DNS systems. We also estimated the properties of the pre-SN
systems of the observed DNS systems, and found that half of the
observed DNS systems seem to have tight pre-SN orbit ( ≲1d),
resulting from the higher probability of surviving post-SN systems.
Inaddition,byassumingthattheresidualHenveloperemainsonthe
surface of the He star companion, we found that the first-born NSs
could accrete enough material to form the mildly recycled pulsars
(𝑃spin∼20ms) in DNS systems.
