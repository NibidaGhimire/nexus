Abstract. Pareschi showed that an ample divisor of degree don
a simple abelian variety of dimension ghas mild singularities when
d < g. We extend his result to general polarized abelian varieties.
We also show that ample divisors of degree 3 or 4 on an abelian
variety have mild singularities.
1.Introduction
Given a polarized smooth projective variety ( X,L), it is usually im-
portant to understand the singularities of ( X,1
mD), where D∈ |mL|
for eachm≥1.
ForD∈ |mL|, we denote by J(1
mD) =J(X,1
mD) the multi-
plier ideal of ( X,D). We also denote by J+(1
mD) the multiplier ideal
J(X,1−ǫ
mD) for 0< ǫ≪1. It is well-known that J(1
mD) =OX
iﬀ (X,1
mD) is log terminal and J+(1
mD) =OXiﬀ (X,1
mD) is log
canonical (see [Laz, 9.3.9]). For a reduced divisor D∈ |L|, we have
another measure of singularities, the adjoint ideal adj( D) deﬁned by
Ein and Lazarsfeld. When adj( D) is trivial, Dis normal with rational
singularities. Note that this implies that ( X,D) is log canonical by
adjunction.
When (A,Θ) is a principally polarized abelian variety, there are re-
sults due to Koll´ ar, Ein-Lazarsfeld, and Hacon describing singularit ies
of (A,Θ). We summarize these results.
•Koll´ ar proved in [Kol2] that ( A,Θ) is log canonical. As a con-
sequence, the closed subset
Σk(Θ) :={x∈A|multxΘ≥k}
has codimension ≥kinAfor eachk≥1.
•Ein-Lazarsfeld proved in [EL] that if Θ is irreducible, it is nor-
mal with rational singularities and ( A,1
mD) is log canonical for

anyD∈ |mΘ|. Thus Σ k(Θ) has codimension kfor some k≥1
iﬀ (A,Θ) splits as a k-fold product of PPAVs.
•Finally, Hacon proved that for any D∈ |mΘ|, if⌊1
mD⌋= 0,
(A,1
mD) is log terminal (see [H1]). Similarly, Σ mk(D) has codi-
mensionkandifequalityholds, ( A,Θ)splitsasa k-foldproduct
of PPAVs.
Hacon ([H2]) and Debarre and Hacon ([DH]) later realised that it
is possible to extend these results to polarized abelian varieties with
small degrees. The main result of [DH] states that, for a polarized
abelian variety ( A,L) of dimension >2 and of degree 2, ( A,1
mD) is log
terminal for any divisor D∈ |mL|, unlessD=mEfor some eﬀective
divisorE. Moreover if D∈ |L|is a prime divisor, Dis normal with
rational singularities.
Debarre and Hacon conjectured that similar results hold for ( A,L)
when deg L:=h0(A,L)< g:= dimA. This was partially conﬁrmed by
Pareschi in [P]: when ( A,L) is a simple polarized abelian variety with
g >degL, every divisor D∈ |L|is normal with rational singularities
and (A,1
mD) is log terminal for D∈ |mL|unlessD=mE.
The following theorem reﬁnes Pareschi’s theorem.
Theorem 1.1. Let(A,L)be a polarized abelian variety of dimension
gand degree d. There exists a constant Mdepending only on gandd
such that
(A)ifg≥dand there exists an eﬀective boundary Q-divisorD∼Q
Lsuch that (A,D)is not log canonical, there exits an abelian
subvariety Kof dimension ≥g−d+1such that h0(L|K)≤M;
(B)ifg > dand there exists an eﬀective Q-divisorD∼QLwith
⌊D⌋= 0such that (A,D)is not Kawamata log terminal or there
exists a prime divisor D∼Lsuch that Ddoes not have rational
singularities, there exits an abelian subvariety Kof dimension
≥g−dsuch that h0(L|K)≤M.
Indeed, Pareschi’s theorem implies divisors of small degrees in very
general abelian varieties of the corresponding moduli space have m ild
singularities and our result shows that the same conclusion holds for
general abelian varieties.
We also study divisors of degree 3 and 4 in details.
Theorem 1.2. Let(A,L)be an indecomposable polarized abelian va-
riety of dimension g≥h0(A,L) = 3. For any eﬀective boundary Q-
divisorD∼QL,(A,D)is log canonical.
Moreover, if g >3SINGULARITIES OF DIVISORS 3
•every prime divisor D∈ |L|is normal with rational singulari-
ties;
•for every D∈ |mL|, as soon as ⌊1
mD⌋= 0and each component
ofDis ample, (A,1
mD)is Kawamata log terminal.
Theorem 1.3. Let(A,L)be an indecomposable polarized abelian va-
riety of dimension g≥h0(L) = 4.
For any eﬀective boundary Q-divisorD∼QLsuch that every irre-
ducible component of Dis ample, (A,D)is log canonical.
Some results similar to Theorem 3 and 4 were also obtained in the
thesis of Flavio Blondeau [B].

closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0 and D=/summationtext
iciDiis an eﬀective Q-
divisors on X, whereDiare prime divisors and ci∈Q. We say that
Dis a boundary divisor if 0 ≤ci≤1. We say that two Q-divisors D
andD′areQ-equivalent if there exists a suﬃciently divisible integer
Msuch that MD∼MD′, i.e.MDandMD′are linearly equivalent.
Letµ:X′→Xbe a log resolution of ( X,D) and write

iaiEi.

Dis a prime divisor, we say that ( X,D) is canonical if ai≥0 for all
EiaboveXwhich is µ-exceptional.
Given a pair as above, we deﬁne the local log canonical threshold at
x∈X,
lctx(X,D) := max {c∈Q|(A,cD)is log canonical at x }
and the global log canonical threshold,
lct(X,D) := max {c∈Q|(A,cD)is log canonical }.
2.2.Log canonical centersandadjunctions. If(X,D)islogcanon-
ical at a generic point of µ(Ei) andai=−1, we call µ(Ei) a log canon-
ical center of ( X,D). When ( X,D) is log canonical at x, Kawamata
showed that there exists a minimal log canonical center Wthoughx,
which has rational singularities around x(see [K1]). We also have im-
portant (sub)adjunctions for log canonical centers. The followin g ver-
sion of adjunction for log canonical centers is due to Xiaodong Jiang
[Jx, Proposition 5.1].
Theorem 2.1. LetWbe a log canonical center of (X,D)and letν:
V→Wbe the normalization. Then there exists an eﬀective Q-divisor
BVonVsuch that
ν∗(KX+D)∼QKV+BV.
2.3.Adjoint ideals. WhenDis a reduced divisor, we can deﬁne the
adjoint ideal of ( X,D). LetL=OX(D) be the corresponding line
bundle. We ﬁx the log resolution µ:X′→Xsuch that the strict
transform of Dis smooth and write µ∗D=D′+F, whereD′is the
strict transform of DandFisµ-exceptional. The adjoint ideal adj( D)
is deﬁned to be the ideal sheaf µ∗OX′(KX′/X−F). The adjoint ideal
is a measure of the singularities of D. Indeed, by [Laz, Proposition
9.3.48], there exists a short exact sequence
(1) 0→OX(KX)·D− →OX(KX+D)⊗adj(D)
→µ∗OD′(KD′)→0,
and adj(D) =OXiﬀDis normal with rational singularities.

over, by [Kol1, Theorem 7.9], it is also equivalent to that ( X,D) is
canonical.SINGULARITIES OF DIVISORS 5
3.Reducible divisors
Given a polarized abelian variety ( A,L) of dimension gand degree d.
The polarization type of Lcan be written as l= (l1,l2,...,lg), where
l1|l2···|lgare positive integers. We know that the isomorphism classes
of (A,L) forms a coarse moduli space Ag,lwhich is quasi-projective
of dimensiong(g+1)
2. We call lgthe exponent of Lorl, which is also
denoted by e(L). We know that non-simple abelian varieties with po-
larization type lform countable many irreducible components of Ag,l.
Indeed, agenericelement ofsuchanirreduciblecomponent corres ponds
to a polarized abelian variety isogeny to the product of two polarized
simple abelian varieties ( K,LK)×(B,LB) and the polarization type
LKorLBis not bounded, i.e. h0(LK) orh0(LB) could be arbitrary
large.
We say that a polarized abelian variety ( A,L) is decomposable if
(A,L) is isomorphic to a product ( K,LK)×(B,LB) of positive dimen-
sional polarized abelian varieites. When ( A,L) is decomposable and
the degree h0(L) is a prime number, any divisor in |L|is reducible and
the study of singularities of divisors in |L|can be reduced to lower
dimensional case. Thus it is reasonable to assume that ( A,L) is inde-
composable.
Let (A,L) be an indecomposable polarized abelian variety of dimen-
siongand degree d. Debarre and Hacon ([DH, Proposition 2]) showed
that ifg≥dand there exists a reducible divisor D=D1+D2∈ |L|,
thenAisnotsimple. WerecallbelowDebarreandHacon’sobservation.
It is well-known that an eﬀective divisor Don an abelian variety
is always nef and the numerical dimension of Dis by deﬁnition the
maximal integer msuch that the cohomology class [ D]m∈H2m(A,Z)
is non-zero.
Letgibe the numerical dimension of Difori= 1,2 and let Kibe
the neutral component of the morphism ϕDi:A→Pic0(A) induced by
Di. Then dim Ki=g−giandDiis the pull-back of an ample divisor
on the quotient pi:A→Bi:=A/Ki. Moreover, Di|K3−i=D|K3−i
is ample for i= 1,2. Hence both ( Dg1

positive integers and by Hodge type inequalities, so is ( Dg1−i

(g−g1+i)!are positive integers for each 0 ≤i≤g1+g2−g,
since they are intersections of integral cohomology classes.
Thusg1+g2−g+1≤d≤g, we see that g1≤g−1. Moreover,
d≥h0(L|K1)h0(D1)+h0(L|K2)h0(D2)+g1+g2−g−1. (2)
Corollary 3.1. Let(A,L)be an indecomposable polarized abelian vari-
ety of degree d=h0(L)≤g= dimA. If there exists a reducible divisor
D=D1+D2∈ |L|, we have 2≤h0(L|K1)≤d. Moreover, this family
of reducible divisors has codimension
≥(h0(L|K1)−1)h0(D1)+(h0(L|K2)−1)h0(D2)
inside|L|.
Proof.We note that a general member of this family of reducible divi-
sors can be written as D1,P+D2,−P, whereP∈Pic0(B1)∩Pic0(B2)⊂
Pic0(A),D1,P∈ |D1+P|, andD2−P∈ |D2−P|. We then get the
estimation of the codimension from (2). /square
Corollary 3.2. Let(A,L)be a polarized abelian variety. Assume that
dimA=g≥d=h0(L)and there exists an eﬀective Q-divisorD∼QL
such that Dis not boundary, there exists a proper abelian subvariety
Ksuch that h0(L|K)≤dimK.
Proof.LetD1be a component of Dwhose coeﬃcient is >1. Then we
may write L=D1+ (L−D1), where L1:=L−D1∼QD−D1is
an ample divisor. Hence by the computation (2), D1is not ample and
h0(L|K1)≤d−g1≤g−g1= dimK1. /square
We now classify explicitly non-prime divisors when d= 3 or 4.
Lemma 3.3. Assume that d= 3and|L|contains a reducible divisor,
then
(1)either there exists a decomposable principally polarized a belian
variety(B,Θ)and an isogeny π:A→Bof degree 3such that

Proof.The proof is similar to that of Lemma 3.3. We apply the same
notations there. We have

Ifg1+g2=g, we are in case (1). Note that either h0(B1,H1) =
h0(B2,H2) = 1 anddeg π= 4 orh0(B1,H1)h0(B2,H2) = 2 and deg π=
2.
Ifg1+g2=g+ 1, we have two possibilities: either h0(B1,H1) =
1,h0(L|K1) = 3, and h0(L|K2)h0(B2,H2) = 1 or h0(B1,H1) = 1,
h0(L|K1) = 2, and h0(B2,H2)h0(L|K2) = 2.
In the former case, since h0(L|K2) = 1 and ( A,L) is indecomposable,
we haveg2=g,g1= 1, and H2= Θ is a principal polarization on A.
We are in Case 2.
In the latter case, if h0(L|K2) = 1, we have B2=Aandh0(A,H2) =
2. In this case g1= 1 and h0(H2|K1) = 2. We are in Case 3.
If we have h0(H2) = 1 in the latter case, we are in Case 4.
Finally, we need to rule out the possibility that g1+g2≥2. The
only non-trivial case we need to rule out is that: g1+g2=g+ 2,
h0(L|K1)h0(H1) = 2,Dg1−1

(g1−1)!·Dg−g1+1

Remark 3.5. Whend= 3, the reducible divisors are discrete in Case
1 of Lemma 3.3 and form a family of dimension 1 in Case 2 of Lemma
3.3.
Whend= 4, the reducible divisors forms a family of dimension ≤2
and the only 2-dimensional case is Case 3 of Lemma 3.4. We claim
that in this case ( A,L2) is indecomposable and a general member of
this family is the sum of a translate of Kwith an irreducible ample
divisor.
Letp:A→E:=A/Kbe the quotient. We consider the short exact
sequence
0→L2(−K)→L2→L2|K→0.
Note that χ(L2(−K)) = 0. If h0(L2(−K)⊗p∗Q)>0 forQ∈Pic0(E)
general,L2(−K) isnefwhoseIitakamodeldominates E. Thisisimpos-
sible, since L2(−K)|K=L|Kis ample, thus L2(−K) is ample whichSINGULARITIES OF DIVISORS 9
would imply that χ(L2(−K))>0. Therefore, the restriction map
H0(L2⊗Q)→H0((L2⊗Q)|K) =H0(L2|K) is an isomorphism. Since
(A,L) is indecomposable, ( K,L2|K) = (K,L|K) is also indecompos-
able. Thus a general divisor in |L2|K|is integral, which implies that a
general divisor in |L2⊗p∗Q|is also irreducible for Q∈Pic0(E) general.
In particular, ( A,L2) is indecomposable.
4.Sums of subvarieties
LetYbe an irreducible subvariety of an abelian variety Aand let
I(Y) ={a∈A|a+Y=Y}.
Then the neutral component of I(Y)0is an abelian subvariety with
dimI(Y)≤dimYandYis ﬁbred by I(Y)0. Therefore, dim I(Y) =
dimYif and only if Yis an abelian subvariety. We also know that
dimI(Y) = 0 iﬀ any desingularization of Yis of general type.
LetVandWbe two irreducible subvarieties of an abelian variety A
and assume that dim V= dim(V+W), thenWis contained in some
translate of I(V)0. For example, if dim W= dimV= dim(V+W),
then both VandWare some translate of an abelian subvariety K.
The following lemma is essentially due to [D2].
Lemma 4.1. LetVandWbe two irreducible subvarieties of an abelian
varietyA, ifdimV+dimW >dim(V+W), thenV+Wis ﬁbred by an
abelian subvariety of Aof dimension ≥dimV+dimW−dim(V+W).
Proof.Letm:V×W→Abe the addition map and let Zbe its image.
By the hypothesis, for any a∈Z, we have that
m−1(a) ={(x,a−x)|x∈Fa}
haspositivedimension, where Fa⊆Vistheprojectionof m−1(a)onW.
Since the diﬀerential map of mis just addition of tangent vectors, we
haveTaZ⊇TxFafor every x∈Fa. Let/an}⌊ra⌋k⌉⊔l⌉{⊔Fa/an}⌊ra⌋k⌉⊔ri}h⊔be the abelian subvariety
generated by Fa, thenTa(a+/an}⌊ra⌋k⌉⊔l⌉{⊔Fa/an}⌊ra⌋k⌉⊔ri}h⊔)⊆TaZ, sinceT0/an}⌊ra⌋k⌉⊔l⌉{⊔Fa/an}⌊ra⌋k⌉⊔ri}h⊔is the linear
span ofTxFa,x∈F. Moreover, since Acontains at most countably
many abelian subvarieties, /an}⌊ra⌋k⌉⊔l⌉{⊔Fa/an}⌊ra⌋k⌉⊔ri}h⊔is a ﬁxed abelian subvariety Kfora
general. Therefore, by lemma 2.3 of [D2], Zis ﬁbred by K. /square
5.Generic vanishing
We summarize and improve in this section some results from generic
vanishing due to Debarre-Hacon, Pareschi, and Pareschi-Popa.
LetFbe a coherent sheaf on an abelian variety A. We deﬁne its
i-th cohomological support loci
Vi(F) :={P∈Pic0(A)|Hi(A,F⊗P)/n⌉}a⊔ionslash= 0}.10 ZHI JIANG AND HUI LIU
We say that Fis IT0, or M-regular, or GV, if respectively Vi(F) =∅,
or codimPic0(A)Vi(F)> i, fori >0 or codimPic0(A)Vi(F)≥i, for
i >0. ForaGV-sheaf Fwhich isnotIT0, wedeﬁneitsgv-indexgv( F)
to be the non-negative integer min {codimPic0(A)Vi(F)−i|i >0}.If
Vi(F) =∅, we set codimPic0(A)Vi(F) =∞. Thus an IT0sheaf is
indeed M-regular.
It may be better to understand IT0, M-regular, and GV sheaves by
considering the Fourier-Mukai transform on A. LetPbe the normal-
ized Poincar´ e bundle on A×Pic0(A) and let
ΦP: D(A)→D(Pic0(A))
be the Fourier-Mukai functor between the derived category of b ounded
complexesofcoherentsheaves of AandPic0(A). Acoherentsheaf Fon
Ais IT0iﬀ Φ P(F) =R0ΦP(F) is a vector bundle on Pic0(A) and we
denote/hatwiderF:=R0ΦP(F)inthiscase. Let F∨=RHom(F,OA[dimA])∈
D(A) be the dual of F. Then Fbe GV (resp. M-regular ) iﬀ
ΦP(F∨) =R0ΦP(F∨) is a sheaf (resp. torsion-free sheaf) on Pic0(A)
(see [PP2]).
Let (A,L) be a polarized abelian variety of dimension gand degree
d. LetD∼QLbe a boundary divisor. We now consider the ideal
sheaf IZassociated with the pair ( A,D) where IZis either J+
D:=
J(A,(1−ǫ)D) for 0< ǫ≪1, orAD:= adj(D) whenD∈ |L|is a
prime divisor, or JD:=J(A,D) when⌊D⌋= 0. Note that Zhas
codimension ≥2 under these assumptions.
Proposition 5.1. Under the above assumptions, L⊗IZis IT0when
IZ=J+
DandL⊗IZis M-regular when IZ=ADorJD. Moreover,
in the latter case, Vi(L⊗IZ)is a union of torsion translates of abelian
subvarieties of codimension ≥i+1fori >0.
Proof.It follows from Nadel’s vanishing that L⊗IZis IT0when IZ=
J+
D.
WhenD∈ |L|isaprimedivisorand IZ=AD, weconsidertheexact
sequence (1). Note that Lis IT0andµ∗OD′(KD′) is M-regular since D
is a prime divisor and thus not ﬁbred by positive-dimensional abelian
subvarieties (see [JLT, Lemma 2.1]). Thus L⊗IZis also M-regular
andVi(L⊗IZ) =Vi(µ∗OD′KD′) is a union of torsion translates of
abelian subvarieties of codimension ≥i+1 fori >0.
When⌊D⌋= 0 and IZ=JD, the statement essentially follows
from [DH, The proof of Theorem 7 and 8, case 1]. For the reader’s
convenience, we provide a slightly diﬀerent argument. Fix a log reso-
lutionµ:X′→Aof (A,D) and we write KX′=µ∗D+/summationtext
iaiEi. NoteSINGULARITIES OF DIVISORS 11
that
L⊗IZ=L⊗µ∗OX′(KX′−⌊µ∗D⌋) =µ∗(µ∗L−⌈/summationdisplay
iaiEi⌉).
Moreover, KX′+µ∗L−⌊µ∗D⌋ ∼QKX′+{µ∗D}. The pair ( X,{µ∗D})
is a klt pair. Thus by the main result of [J] or [M], L⊗IZis either M-
regular or there exists a quotient p:A→Bbetween abelian varieties
and a rank 1 sheaf LonBsuch that L⊗IZ≃p∗L. The latter is
impossible since Z⊂Ahas codimension ≥2 by the assumption that
⌊D⌋= 0 and thus L⊗IZis ample restricted to an open subset of A
whose complementary has codimension ≥2. /square

Lemma 5.2. Under the above assumption, let IZbe either ADor
JD. Assume that Vi(L⊗IZ)/n⌉}a⊔ionslash=∅for some i >0, thendimZ≥
dimVi(L⊗IZ)+i−1.
The main point of this lemma is that when IZis either J+
D,or
AD, orJD,L⊗IZis, in some sense, always a direct summand of the
pushforward of the canonical bundle of some smooth projective v ariety
and hence its higher direct images have nice properties.
The following results are due to Pareschi (see [P, see the proof of
Theorem B]).
Proposition 5.3. LetIZbe an ideal sheaf on A. Assume that L⊗IZ
is IT0,Extk(IZ,OX) = 0fork≥χ(L⊗IZ). In particular, for each
irreducible component ZiofZ(including the embedding components),
codim AZi≤χ(L⊗IZ).
Proof.Indeed, by [P, the proof of Theorem B (1)], Extk(IZ,OX) = 0
fork≥χ(L⊗IZ). Thus Extk(OZ,OX) = 0 for k≥χ(L⊗IZ) +
1. For each irreducible component ZiofZ(including the embedding
components), there exists locally a sheaf M ֒→OZwhose support is
equal to Zi. Letkbe the codimension of ZiinsideA. We have
Extk(OZ,OA)→Extk(M,OA)→Extk+1(OZ/M,OA).
Since the support of Extk+1(M,OA) isZiand the support of
Extk+1(OZ/M,OA)
has codimension ≥k+1, we conclude that Extk(OZ,OA)/n⌉}a⊔ionslash= 0. Thus,
for each irreducible component ZiofZ(including the embedding com-
ponents), codim AZi≤χ(L⊗IZ). /square

IZ)/n⌉}a⊔ionslash=∅for some i >0,codim AZ≤gv(L⊗IZ)+1≤χ(L⊗IZ)+1.12 ZHI JIANG AND HUI LIU
Proof.By Lemma 5.2, for i >0 such that codim AVi(L⊗IZ)−i
computes the gv-index of L⊗IZ, we have codim AZ≤g−dimVi(L⊗
IZ)−i+1 = gv( L⊗IZ)+1≤χ(L⊗IZ)+1, where the last inequality
follows from the main result of [PP1]. /square
Lemma 5.5. Assume that (A,L)is indecomposable. Let IZbe an ideal
sheaf such that L⊗IZis M-regular and Z/n⌉}a⊔ionslash=∅. Then2≤χ(A,L|Z)≤
d−1, unlessZis a reduced point.
Proof.By Proposition 5.1, we know that L⊗IZis M-regular and
henceχ(L⊗IZ)>0 by the main result of [PP1]. By the short exact
sequence
0→L⊗IZ→L→L|Z→0,
we see that L|Zis M-regular and its gv-index is ≥2. IfL|Zis not
IT0, we know by [PP1] that χ(A,L|Z)≥gv(L|Z)≥2. IfL|Zis IT0
andχ(A,L|Z) = 1, the Fourier-Mukai transform /hatwide(L|Z) ofL|Zis a line
bundle on Pic0(A). ThusZis a translate of an abelian subvariety Kof
Aand (K,L|K) is a principally polarized abelian variety. If dim K >
0, (A,L) is decomposable by [DH, Lemma 1], which contradicts the
assumption. /square
Proposition 5.6. Let(A,L)be a polarized abelian variety. Assume
that(A,D)is a log canonical pair. Let Cbe the union of some log
canonical centers of (A,D). Then,
•whenD∼QcLand0< c <1,L⊗ICis IT0;
•whenD∼QL,L⊗ICis GV.
Proof.Fix a log resolution ρ:X→Aof (A,D). We write
KX+E1+···+En+E<1=ρ∗D, (3)
where−⌊E<1⌋is an eﬀective µ-exceptional divisor. We may assume
thatE1,...,E kare the divisors over irreducible component of Cwith
discrepancy −1. Note that L⊗IC=ρ∗(ρ∗L(−E1−···−Ek−⌊E<1⌋).
In the ﬁrst case,
ρ∗L−E1−···−Ek−⌊E<1⌋ ∼QKX+Ek+1+···+En+{E<1}+(1−c)ρ∗L,
we then conclude by [F, Theorem 3.16.3] that L⊗ICis IT0.
In the second case, by the same argument as above, we have π∗
M(L⊗

and thus by Hacon’s theorem (see the main theorem of [H3] or [JP,

6.General polarized abelian varieties (A,L)with
dimA≥degL
The goal of this section is to prove the following result.
Theorem 6.1. Let(A,L)be a polarized abelian variety of dimension
gand degree d. There exists a constant Mdepending only on gandd
such that
(A)ifg≥dand there exists an eﬀective boundary Q-divisorD∼Q
Lsuch that (A,D)is not log canonical, there exits an abelian
subvariety Kof dimension ≥g−d+1such that h0(L|K)≤M;
(B)ifg > dand there exists an eﬀective Q-divisorD∼QLwith
⌊D⌋= 0such that (A,D)is not Kawamata log terminal or there
exists a prime divisor D∼Lsuch that Ddoes not have rational
singularities, there exits an abelian subvariety Kof dimension
≥g−dsuch that h0(L|K)≤M.
Weremarkthat( A)isanextensionofCorollary3.2. Bythefollowing
lemma, ( B) implies that Pareschi’s theorem [P, Theorem 1] holds for
general polarized abelian subvarieties in the moduli space of ( A,L).
Lemma 6.2. Let(A,L)be a polarized abelian variety. Let Kbe an
abelian subvariety and let Bbe the Poincar´ e complement of Kwith
respect to L. Thene(L|B)dividese(L)e(L|K).
Proof.We ﬁrst ﬁx an isogeny π:A→A′such that there exists a
principal polarization L′onA′andL=π∗L′. LetK′=π(K). Then
it is easy to verify that B′:=π(B) is the Poincar´ e complement of K′
withrespect to L′. By[BL, Corollary12.1.2], e(L′|K′) =e(L′|B′). Since
e(L′|K′)divides e(L|K)ande(L|B)divides e(L)e(L′|B′),weconcludethe
proof. /square
The proofs of ( A) and (B) are almost identical. Let’s ﬁrst prove ( A)
and point out the necessary modiﬁcations of arguments to prove ( B).14 ZHI JIANG AND HUI LIU
We also remark that the constant Mis explicit but our computation
intheproofiscertainly not optimal. As wecan seein thenext sections ,
the restriction should be much more strict.
6.1.The proof of (A).
Proof.Let 0< c= lct(A,D)<1, (A,cD) is log canonical. Let Z
be a minimal log canonical center of ( A,cD). We know that Zis
normal with at worst rational singularities (see [K1]). After a small
perturbation of D(see [Kol3, Proposition 8.7.1]), we may assume that
IZ=J(cD).
Moreover, by Proposition 5.6, L⊗IZis IT0. We denote by χ=
χ(L⊗IZ). Note that 2 ≤χ≤d−2 and dim Z≥g−χ≥2 by
Proposition 5.3 and Corollary 5.7.
We now apply the argument of Debarre and Hacon in [DH]. Let
J⊂A×|L|be the incident variety
{(a,s)∈A×|L| |s|a+Z= 0}.
Note that the projection p:J→Ais surjective and Jis indeed a
Pχ−1-bundle over A. Letq:J→ |L|be the natural projection. For
s∈q(J) general, we denote by Jsthe ﬁber over sandDsthe divisor
corresponding to s. By deﬁnition,
Js={a∈A|a+Z⊂Ds}. (4)
LetJi
sbe an irreducible component of Js. We consider the addition
morphism:
µ:Ji
s×Z→Vs:=Ji
s+Z⊂Ds⊂A.
Sinces∈q(J)general,dim Ji

≥g−d+1. Let t∈Vsbe general and denote by Ftthe corresponding
ﬁber ofµ. We denote by Ztthe image of the projection from FttoZ.
Observe that
Ft={(t−z,z)|z∈Zt}.
We then conclude by Lemma 4.1 that Ztgenerates an abelian sub-
varietyKof dimension ≥g−d+ 1≥2 andVsis ﬁbred by K, i.e.
K+Vs=Vs.
We remark that FtorZtmay be reducible. After taking the nor-

ates the same abelian variety K.

By (4), Ji
s=π−1(ˆJi
s). Moreover, since Ftis a general ﬁber of
µ, ˆµis generically ﬁnite. We then conclude that ˆZis not ﬁbred by
positive-dimensional tori of A/K. Indeed, if ˆZis ﬁbred by a positive-
dimensional abelian tori B, so isˆVs. ThenVsis ﬁbred by π−1(B) and
so isJi
s. Then both ˆJisandˆZare ﬁbred by B, which implies that ˆ µis
not generically ﬁnite.
Letn= dimZ. We claim that ( Ln·Z)≤(Lg) =g!d. Indeed, since
L⊗IZis IT0, it is continuously globally generated. Thus,

Inductively, there exist divisors Di≡L, for 1≤i≤g−nsuch
thatD1∩D2···∩Dg−nis of pure dimension nand contains Zas an
irreducible component. Hence
(Ln·Z)≤(Lg) =g!d.
We claim that ( LdimK·K) is bounded by a constant depending only

By Theorem 2.1,

By Viehweg’s weakly positivity (see [V]), KZ/KˆZis pseudo-eﬀective
1. SinceˆZis not ﬁbred by abelian subvarieties, it is of general type.
By Fujita’s approximation (see [Laz, Theorem 11.4.4]), there exists a n
Q-ample divisor HonˆZsuch that KˆZ−HisQ-eﬀective and 0 <
vol(KˆZ)−(HdimˆZ)≪1. Then L|Z−p∗
ZHis also pseudo-eﬀective.
Note that a general ﬁber of pZis exactly Zt. We then have
(L|Z)n>((L|Z)dimZt·(p∗
ZH)dimˆZ) = (HdimˆZ)(L|dimZt
K·Zt).
Thus
g!d≥(Ln·Z)≥vol(KˆZ)(L|dimZt
K·Zt).
We also know that vol( KˆZ)≥2(dimˆZ)! by Severi’s inequality (see
[Bar] and [Zh]). Therefore,
(L|dimZt
K·Zt)≤g!d
2(dimˆZ)!.
Note that an irreducible component of Ztgenerates Kand 2L|Kis
globally generated. For H1,...,H dimZt−1∈ |2L|K|general, an irre-
ducible component CofZt∩H1···∩HdimZt−1is an irreducible curve
generating K. By [D3, Proposition 4.1]
/parenleftbig(L|K·C)

Since
(L|K·C)≤2dimZt−1g!d
(dimˆZ)!,
h0(L|K) is bounded by a constant depending only on gandd./square
6.2.The proof of (B).
Proof.By (A), we may assume that ( A,D) is log canonical. We denote
byIZthe multiplier ideal sheaf J(D) whenD∼QLis aQ-divisor
such that ⌊D⌋= 0 and ( A,D) is not Kawamata log terminal or the
adjoint ideal sheaf adj( A,D) whenD∈ |L|is a prime divisor, which
does not have canonical singularities.
In either case, Zis reduced and each irreducible component is a log
canonical center of ( A,D). By Proposition 5.1, L⊗IZis M-regular
and by Corollary 5.7, 1 ≤χ(L⊗IZ)≤d−2. LetZ1be an irreducible

ever, it is easy to verify that it is harmless to assume that both varie ties are smooth

component of Zof maximal dimension. We have that L⊗IZ1is GV
by Proposition 5.6. Moreover, since L⊗IZ⊂L⊗IZ1⊂L,
1≤χ(L⊗IZ)≤χ:=χ(L⊗IZ1).
We also know by Proposition 5.4 that dim Z1= dimZ≥g−χ(L⊗
IZ)−1≥g−χ−1.
We then consider the subscheme
J:={(a,s)∈A×|L| |s|a+Z1= 0}.
LetJbe the unique component of Jdominating Awith reduced
scheme structure. We denote respectively by pandqthe projections
fromJtoAand|L|. We also know that dim J=g+χ−1.
Fora∈Ageneral, we then denote by Ji
san irreducible component
of a ﬁber of J→q(J) overs∈q(J) such that a∈Ji
s. Then dim Ji

s×Z→Vs:=Ji
s+Z⊂Ds,
whereDs⊂Ais the corresponding divisor. Since a∈Ageneral, we
know that Ji
sis an irreducible component of
{z∈A|z+Z⊂Ds}
througha.
Then we apply exactly the same argument of the proof of ( A). One
diﬀerence is that L⊗IZ1may not be M-regular and thus may not be
continuously globally generated. However, since L⊗IZis M-regular,
there still exist divisors Di≡L, for 1≤i≤g−dimZ1such that
D1∩D2··· ∩Dg−dimZ1is of pure dimension dim Z1and contains Z1
as an irreducible component. Another diﬀerence is that Z1may not
be normal. We thus need to consider the normalization of Z1while
applying Theorem 2.1. /square
7.Divisors of degree 3
Theorem 7.1. Let(A,L)be an indecomposable polarized abelian va-
riety of degree d= 3of dimension g≥3. Fix an eﬀective Q-divisor
D∼QL, if the pair (A,D)is not log canonical, there exits a ﬁbration
p:A→Eto an elliptic curve such that D=a1p∗x+D2, wherex∈E
is a point, a1>1, andD2is an eﬀective Q-divisor.
Proof.We ﬁrst claim that for any boundary Q-divisorD∼QL,J+
D=
OAand hence ( A,D) is log canonical. Let IZ=J+
D. IfIZ/n⌉}a⊔ionslash=
OX,Zis a subscheme of codimension ≥2. However, L⊗IZis IT0
by Proposition 5.1 and by Lemma 5.7, 2 ≤χ(L|Z)≤1, which is
impossible.18 ZHI JIANG AND HUI LIU
We now classify the Q-divisors D∼QLwhich are not boundary
divisors. We write D=a1D1+D2, where D1is a prime divisor,
a1>1, andD2is an eﬀective Q-divisor. Then L−D1∼Q(a1−
1)D1+D2is ample. Since an ample divisor on an abelian variety is
alwayslinearlyequivalent toaneﬀective divisor, thereexists aninteg ral
reducible divisor D′=D1+D′

3.3, we are in the second cases.

Theorem 7.2. Let(A,L)be an indecomposable polarized abelian va-
riety of dimension g > h0(A,L) = 3. Then
•a prime divisor D∈ |L|is normal and has rational singularities;
•for an eﬀective Q-divisorD∼QLsuch that ⌊D⌋= 0, if(A,D)
is not Kawamata log terminal, there exists an abelian subvar iety
KofAof dimension g−2such that χ(L|K) = 2andJDis
the ideal sheaf of a translate of K. Moreover, if each irreducible
component of Dis ample, (A,D)is Kawamata log terminal.
Proof.We argue by contradiction. Assume the contrary, ( A,D) is not
purely log terminal (or canonical) in the ﬁrst case and ( A,D) is not
Kawamata log terminal in the second case. Let IZ/subsetornotdbleqlOAbe the
adjoint ideal ADin the ﬁrst case and be the multiplier ideal J(D)
in the second case. Moreover, in any case, we already know that th e
pair (A,D) is log canonical by Theorem 7.1, hence the subscheme Zis
reduced.
By Corollary 5.7, χ(A,L⊗IZ) = 1 and χ(L|Z) = 2 and by Propo-
sition 5.4 , dim Z=g−2. Note that Zis connected. Indeed, if Z
has 2 connected components Z1andZ2, sinceL|Zihave gv-index ≥2,
χ(L|Z1) =χ(L|Z2) = 1 and Z=Z1⊔Z2. By Lemma 5.5, both Z1and
Z2are reduced points and this is a contradiction.
LetJbe the subvariety of A×|L|deﬁned by the closed condition
{(a,s)∈A×|L| |s|a+Z= 0}.
Letpandqbe respectively the projection from JtoAand|L|. For
eacha∈A,p−1(a) is identiﬁed with the subspace

whereϕ:A→Pic0(A) is the isogeny induced by LandPϕ(a)is the

ponent of Jwhich dominates Aviap. We will still use pandq
to denote respectively the projection from JtoAand|L|. Since
χ(A,L⊗IZ) =h0(A,L⊗IZ⊗P) = 1 for P∈Pic0(A) general,
p:J→Ais birational.SINGULARITIES OF DIVISORS 19
We then consider q:J→ |L|=P2. It is clear that dim q(J)≥1.
We claim that qis surjective.
Assume thatdim q(J) = 1. Let s∈q(J)beageneralpoint andlet Js
be the corresponding ﬁber Js. By deﬁnition, we see that Js+Z⊂Ds,
whereDsis the divisor corresponding to s. Since dim Z=g−2>0
and dimJs=g−1, we conclude that Dscontains a component which
is not ample by Lemma 4.1. Hence |L|contains a one-dimensional
family of reducible divisors. We are in case (2) of Lemma 3.3, namely
there exists a quotient pE:A→Ewith connected kernel Ksuch
thatDs=p∗
Exs+ Θs, wherexs∈Eis a point and Θ sis a principal
polarization. Thus q(J)⊂ |L|is an elliptic curve. Since Jis birational
toA, we conclude that each connected component of Jsis a translate
of a ﬁxed abelian variety K. We apply the analysis of Lemma 3.3 to
conclude that L(−K) is a principal polarization. Since Zis connected,
after a translation, we may assume that Zis contained in K. Then we
haveL(−K)⊂L⊗IZ. SinceL(−K) is ample, L⊗IZis M-regular,
andχ(A,L(−K)) =χ(A,L⊗IZ) = 1,L(−K) =L⊗IZ, which is
absurd.
Therefore we may assume that q:J→ |L|=P2is surjective. For
s∈ |L|general, Js=q−1(s) is a subvariety of Aof pure dimension
g−2, the corresponding divisor Dsis a prime divisor. We note that
Js+Z⊂Ds. Since dim Js+dimZ >dimDsandDsis ample, Js+Zis
a proper subset of Dsby 4.1. Therefore dim Js= dimZ= dim(Js+Z).
Hence each connected component of Jsis a translate of a ﬁxed abelian
subvariety Kofdimension g−2. SinceZisreduced, after atranslation,
we may assume that ZisK. We have h0(K,L|K) = 2.
We now show that any prime divisor D∈ |L|is normal and has
rational singularities.
We ﬁx a´ etale cover π:A→A′of degree 3 from Ato a PPAV ( A′,Θ)
such that L≃π∗L′, whereL′:=OA′(Θ). Since h0(K,L|K) = 2,π|K
induces an isomorphism from Kto its image, which we still denote by
K. LetBandB′be respectively the Poincar´ e complementary of Kin

8.Divisors of degree 4
Theorem 8.1. Let(A,L)be a polarized abelian variety of dimension
g≥h0(L) = 4. LetD∼QLbe an eﬀective boundary divisor. Assume
that(A,D)is not log canonical, then J+
Ddeﬁnes a translate of an
abelian variety Kof dimension g−2such that χ(L|K) = 2.
Proof.LetIZ:=J+
D. Then by assumption, Zis a subscheme of
codimension ≥2. By Nadel’s vanishing, L⊗IZis IT0. Since ( A,L)
is indecomposable, by Corollary 5.7, 1 ≤χ(L⊗IZ)≤2. Moreover,
sinceZis of codimension ≥2,χ(L⊗IZ) = 2. Hence both L⊗IZand
L|Zare IT0sheaves whose holomorphic Euler characteristics are 2. By
Proposition 5.3, we know that Zis of pure dimension g−2. Note that
Zis connected, otherwise ( A,L) is decomposable.
We also claim that Zis reduced. Indeed, let c= lct(A,D)<1,
(A,cD) is a log canonical pair and J+
D⊂J(A,cD). Similarly, L⊗
J(A,cD) is IT0andχ(L⊗J(A,cD)) = 2. Thus J+
D=J(A,cD)
deﬁnes a reduced subscheme.
We consider again the subvariety
J:={(a,s)|s|a+Z= 0} ⊂A×|L|.
Note that the ﬁrst projection p:J→AmakesJaP1-bundle over A.
It is easy to see that J=PA(V), where Vis the rank 2 vector bundle

where Pis the Poincar´ e line bundle on A×Pic0(A),p1andp2are
the natural projections on A×Pic0(A), andϕL:A→Pic0(A) is the
isogeny induced by L.
It is clear that the ﬁbers of J→Avary inside |L|and hence
dimq(J)≥2. We claim that the second projection q:J→ |L| ≃P3
is surjective. Otherwise, dim q(J) = 2 and we see as before that for
anys∈q(J), the corresponding divisor Dsis reducible. We have a 2-
dimensional reducible divisors inside |L|. Thus by Lemma 3.4 and Re-
mark 3.5, we are in Case (3) of Lemma 3.4. The subvariety q(J)⊂ |L|
corresponds to the family of divisors
{p∗x+|L−p∗x| |wherex∈EandL−p∗x≡L2}.
Thus for s∈q(J) general, a connected component of the ﬁber Jsof
Joversis a translate of the kernel KofA→E. We also see that Zis
contained in a translate of K. We may assume that Zis a subscheme
ofK. Then we have L(−K)⊂L⊗IZ, butL(−K) is ample, L⊗IZ
is M-regular,and χ(A,L(−K)) =χ(A,L⊗IZ) = 2, we must have
L(−K) =L⊗IZ, which is again impossible.
Thus we may assume that q:J→ |L|is surjective. For s∈ |L|
general, let Jsbe the corresponding ﬁber of q. We have dim Js=g−2.
Note that Js+Z⊂DsandDsis irreducible. Thus dim( Js+Z) =
dimZ= dimJs=g−2. Hence there exists an abelian subvariety Kof
Aof dimension g−2 such that Zis supported on a translate of Kand
Jsis a union of translates of K. After a translation, we may assume
thatZ=K.
