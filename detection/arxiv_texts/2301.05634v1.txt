Here we study the quark orbital angular momentum of the groun d octet baryons employing an
extended chiral constituent quark model, within which the b aryon wave functions are taken to be
superposition of the traditional qqqand the qqqq¯qhigher Fock components. Coupling between
the two conﬁgurations is estimated using the3P0quark-antiquark creation mechanism, and the
corresponding coupling strength is determined by ﬁtting th e sea ﬂavor asymmetry of the nucleon.
The obtained numerical results show that the quark angular m omentum of the nucleon, Σ, Λ and Ξ
hyperons are in the range 0 .10-0.30. In addition, the quark angular momentum of all the hypero ns
are a little bit smaller than that of the nucleon. And the octe t baryons spin fractions taken by the
intrinsic quark orbital angular momentum could be up to 60% i n present model.
I. INTRODUCTION
In the traditional constituent quark models, the
ground octet baryons are composed of three quarks that
are in their S-wave, thus the total spin of the baryons
arecontributed from only the spin of their quarkcontent,
namely, the SU(2) mixed symmetric spin conﬁguration
of the three-quark system with total spin S= 1/2 should
account for the total spin of corresponding baryons com-
pletely [1, 2]. However, in the late 1980s, the famous
European muon collaboration (EMC) found that the
quark spin could take only a small fraction of the proton
spin [3, 4], which raised up the proton spin crisis.
Since then intensively experimental measurements on
the spin structure of proton have been taken [5–11], and,
on the theoretical side, the spin decomposition of proton
in gauge theory was proposed in Refs. [12–15]. Accord-
ingly, contributions of the quarks, the gluons and orbital
angular momentum (OAM) to the total proton spin have
been investigated by lattice QCD [16–23], chiral pertur-
bation theory [24–27], as well as other theoretical ap-
proaches [28–39], for recent reviews on status of the ex-
perimental and theoretical investigations on nucleon spin
structure, see Refs. [40–46].
Based on these previous theoretical studies, one may
conclude that the intrinsic sea content in baryons should
play important roles in the static properties of baryons.
On the other hand, the experimentally observed sea

§Electronic address: xiejujun@impcas.ac.cnﬂavor asymmetry of proton [47, 48] also reveals the
non-perturbative eﬀects of the intrinsic sea content in
baryons.
Constructively,the protoncanbedepicted byameson-
cloudpicture thatthe protonisexplainedto bea neutron
core surrounding by pion meson cloud. Furthermore, one
can also consider eﬀects of the KΛ,KΣ, andπ∆ compo-
nents in proton [49–52]. Within the meson cloud model,
spin of protoncould be directly decomposed into the spin
and orbital angular momentum of quarks, since the me-
son clouds should be in their P-wave states relative to
the baryon cores. And the sea ﬂavor asymmetry may be
described by the πNandπ∆ components with appro-
priate probabilities in proton. Within this picture, one
can also explain the intrinsic strange-antistrange quark
asymmetry in proton if the KΛ andKΣ components are
taken into account [52]. Straightforwardly, the meson
cloud picture for nucleon can be extended to the other
octet baryons [53].
Alternatively, the extended chiral constituent quark
model (E χCQM), in which the higher Fock compo-
nents in the baryon’s wave function are assumed to
be compact pentaquark conﬁgurations, was proposed to
study the strangenessmagnetic moment [54], strangeness
form factor [55] and strangeness spin of proton [32],
and further developed to investigate the intrinsic sea
content and meson-baryon sigma terms of the octet
baryons [56–58]. In addition, the experimental data for
decays of baryon resonances such as ∆(1232), P11(1440),
S11(1535),S11(1650),D13(1520) and D13(1700) [59–64]
can be also well reproduced by E χCQM. Very recently,
the EχCQM has been applied to study the quark OAM
of the proton and ﬂavor-dependent axial charges of the
ground state octet baryons [65–67]. It’s shown that the
singlet axial charge g(0)
A, the isovector axial charge g(3)
A2
andtheSU(3)octetaxialcharge g(8)
Aoftheoctetbaryons
obtained in the E χCQM, are consistent with predictions
by lattice QCD and chiral perturbation theory, if the
model parameters are ﬁxed by ﬁtting the data for ¯d−¯u
asymmetry of proton [48]. As an direct extension of
Ref. [65], here we investigate the quark OAM of the
ground octet baryons, and analyze the spin decompo-
sition of the corresponding baryons in the E χCQM.
The present manuscript is organized as follows. In
Sec. II, we present the framework which includes the
EχCQM and the formalism for calculations on the OAM
in corresponding model, the explicit numerical results
and discussions are given in Sec. III. Finally, we give a
brief summary of present work in Sec. IV.
II. FRAMEWORK
To investigate the quark orbital angular momentum of
the ground octet baryons, here we employ the E χCQM,
in which the wave functions of baryons can be expressed
in a general form as:

for the traditional three-quark components of the octet
baryons, while the second term denotes the wave func-
tions for the compact ﬁve-quark components, with the
sum over iruns over all the possible ﬁve-quark conﬁgu-
rations with a q¯q(q=u,d,s) pair that may form con-
siderable higher Fock components in the octet baryons.

withi= 1···17 are shown in Table I, where the ﬂavor,
spin, color and orbital wave functions for the four-quark
subsystem are denoted by the Young tableaux of the S4
permutation group.
As we can see in Table I, spin wave functions of the
four-quark subsystem in conﬁgurations with i= 1···7
are [22] S, which leads to the total spin S4= 0 for the
four-quarksubsystem, thus one only need to consider the
combination of the quark (antiquark) OAM and spin of
theantiquarktogetthetotalspinofagivenbaryon. And
a general form for the wave functions of these conﬁgura-
tions can be expressed as

color wave functions for the presently considered ﬁve-
quark conﬁgurations have been given in Refs. [67].
Whilefortheﬁve-quarkconﬁgurationswith i= 8···17
showninTableI,thespinwavefunctionofthefour-quark
subsystem is [31] Swhich results in the total spin S4= 1
for the four-quark subsystem. Accordingly, we have to
take into account the combination of the spin of both thefour-quark and the antiquark and the quark (antiquark)
OAM to get the total spin of the octet baryon. One
should note that combination of the spin for four-quark
subsystem S4= 1 and the quark OAM L= 1 will lead to
J=L⊕S4= 0, 1 or 2, and the former two Jthose could
form the total spin SB= 1/2 of the presently studied
octet baryons, when combine to the spin of the antiquark
S¯q= 1/2 are applicable. Hereafter, we denote these two
cases of wave functions as Set I and Set II, respectively.
The general forms for wave functions of the ﬁve-quark
conﬁgurations with i= 8···17 in these two cases are

Next we turn to the coeﬃcients Cq
iin Eq. (1). Gen-
erally, to get the probability amplitude for a ﬁve-quark
component in a given baryon, one has to evaluate energy
of the ﬁve-quark conﬁguration Eq
iand its coupling to the
three-quark component in the corresponding baryon.
In present work, the energy Eq
ifor a given ﬁve-quark
conﬁguration is estimated using the chiral constituent
quark model, within which the hyperﬁne interaction be-
tween quarks is [2]

whereE0is a degenerated energy for all the studied

quarks and the ﬂavor SU(3) breaking eﬀects are not
taken into account, and δmandns

ference of the light and strange quarks and number of
strange quarks in the corresponding ﬁve-quark system,
respectively. Here both E0andδmare taken to be the
empirical values [56]:
E0= 2127 MeV , δm= 120 MeV .(9)
To calculate the transition coupling matrix elements
between the qqqandqqqq¯qcomponents, here we adopt
a widely accepted3P0quark-antiquark creation mecha-
nism [69, 70], which has been used to study the intrinsic

To reduce free model parameters, here we just ﬁx V
by ﬁtting experimental data for the intrinsic sea ﬂavor

iis energy of the corresponding ﬁve-quark conﬁg-

Accordingly, the involved parameters in present model
are the coupling strengths PM
l(six involved ones in to-
tal), the degeneratedenergy E0forall the ﬁve-quarkcon-
ﬁgurations given in Table I, mass diﬀerence of the light
and strange quark δm, and the common factor Vfor the
transition matrix elements /an}bracketle{tˆT/an}bracketri}ht. As shown in Eqs. (7)
and (9), the former eight parameters are taken to be the
empirical values used in the literature. And by ﬁtting
the sea ﬂavor asymmetry of proton in Eq. (13), one can
get the following values of V:
VI= 570±46 MeV , (16)
VII= 697±80 MeV , (17)
for the two diﬀerent sets of wave functions using in
present model, respectively.
Note that one could also consider the higher Fock
components qqq(q¯q)2in the baryons. Energies of these
kinds of components those can couple to the ground
state octet baryons may be about 600 −900 MeV higher
than the ﬁve-quark components, taking into account the
two quark-antiquark pairs creations, a rough estimation
shows that the probability amplitudes of the qqq(q¯q)2
components are about 1 /5 of those of the presently con-
sidered ﬁve-quark components.

we show the probabilities of the ﬁve-quark components
withlightandstrangequark-antiquarkpairsineachoctet
baryon in Fig. 2. As discussed explicitly in [67], the
obtained baryon wave functions in the both the Set I
and Set II could result in the meson-baryon sigma terms
consistent with the predictions by other theoretical ap-
proaches, although the probabilities for the ﬁve-quark
components in the two Sets are very diﬀerent. And
one may note that the upper limit of probabilities for
the intrinsic ﬁve-quark components obtained in Set II of
present model are larger than 50%, while these values
are very close to those predicted in Refs. [71–73], wherethe model proposed by Brodsky, Hoyer, Peterson and
Sakai [74] was employed.
Using the wave functions shown in Eqs. (2), (3) and
(4) with explicit Cq
icalculated by Eq. (11), one can di-
rectly calculate the quark OAM of the octet baryons by
Eq. (18). The corresponding numerical results for Lu,
LdandLsof the proton, Σ+, Σ0, Λ and Ξ0baryons are
presented in Table II. And the ﬂavor-dependent quark
OAM of neutron, Σ−and Ξ−can be obtained directly
using the SU(2) isospin symmetry, which yields
Lu(d)(n) =Ld(u)(p), Ls(n) =Ls(p),(20)
Lu(d)(Σ−) =Ld(u)(Σ+), Ls(Σ−) =Ls(Σ+),(21)
Lu(d)(Ξ−) =Ld(u)(Ξ0), Ls(Ξ−) =Ls(Ξ0).(22)
And in Fig. 3, we depict the presently obtained total
quark OAM Lqof all ﬂavors compared to the results pre-
dicted by lattice QCD [20], unquenched quark model [38]
and light cone constituent quark model [39].
Since all the valence quarks in the octet baryons are in
theirS-wave, the quark OAM should be onlycontributed
from the ﬁve-quark higher Fock components of baryons.
Therefore, the quark OAM should be sensitive to the
probabilities of the ﬁve-quark components. Therefore, as
we can see in Table II, the results for the quark OAM
obtained in Set II model are about 1 .5−2 times of those
in Set I model. On the other hand, in Set I, the ﬁve-
quark conﬁgurations with i= 8···17 don’t contribute
to the quark OAM of proton, as discussed in Ref. [65],
but it’s not true for Set II. Consequently, the relationship
between the ﬂavor sea asymmetry and total quark OAM
of proton in Set II is
Lq≈9/4Ia, (23)
instead of the ∼4/3Iain Set I obtained in Ref. [65].
For the nucleon, in both Sets I and II, the up and
down quarks OAM are comparable to each other, this
is very diﬀerent from the lattice QCD predictions in
Ref. [20], where the obtained light quark OAM are Lu=
−0.107(40) and Ld= 0.247(38), while the total quark6

results predicted by lattice QCD [20], unquenched quark

OAM of all ﬂavors in Ref. [20] is in the same range of the
presently obtained results, as shown in Fig. 3. In addi-
tion, thepresentlyobtainedtotalquarkOAMisinconsis-
tentwiththepredictionsbyunquenchedquarkmodel[38]
and light cone constituent quark model [39].
For the other octet baryons, the light quarks OAM of
the hyperons are smaller than that of nucleon, while the
strange quark OAM of hyperons are 2 −4times of that of
nucleon. Obviously, this is because of the more strange
quark contents in hyperons than in nucleon. In Ref. [38],
the total quark OAM of Λ was studied employing the
unquenched quark model by considering the eﬀects of
thequark-antiquarkpairscreatedviathe3P0mechanism,
andthepredicted LqofΛhyperonis0 .075,thatissmaller
than the presently obtained results in both Sets I and II.
B. The spin decomposition of the octet baryons
It’s also very interesting to investigate the spin decom-
position of the octet baryons. In present model, the spin
and OAM of gluons are not involved, accordingly, one
can decompose the octet baryons spin by
SB= 1/2 =/summationdisplay
f/bracketleftBig/parenleftBig
∆fval+∆fsea/parenrightBig
/2+Lsea
f/bracketrightBig
,(24)
where ∆fval/2 and ∆fsea/2 are the ﬂavor-dependentva-
lence and intrinsic sea quarks spin, respectively, and Lsea
f
the intrinsic seaquarkOAM which should be the same as
those numerical results shown in Table II, and the sum
overfruns over the three ﬂavors u,dands. We presentournumericalresultsofSets I andII obtainedby limiting
the sea ﬂavor asymmetry in proton to be the experimen-
tally measured central value Ia=¯d−¯u= 0.118 [48]
in Table III, compared to the results in the traditional
three-quark constituent quark model.
As shown in Table III, in the traditional three-quark
constituent quark model, only spin of the valence up and
down quarks contribute to the nucleon spin. While in
the presently employed E χCQM, spin of the valence and
intrinsic sea quarks contribute ∼63% and 6% of the nu-
cleon spin, respectively, and the nucleon spin arisen from
the intrinsic sea quarkOAMis 31%, if the wavefunctions
of Set I are adopted. This is in good agreement with the
results in [38] obtained by the unquenched quark model.
While if we use the wave functions of Set II, the nucleon
spin contributed from the valence quark spin is 46%, and
the intrinsic sea quark spin and OAM should contribute
1% and 53% to the nucleon spin, respectively. In addi-
tion, if the uncertainty in present model caused by ﬁtting
the sea ﬂavor asymmetry data are taken into account,
contributions from the quark OAM to the nucleon spin
could be up to 60%.
Compared to the experimental data, i.e. the measured
negative value for spin of strange quark in proton ∆ s,
and the proton spin fraction carried by quark spin Σ =
0.33(10) [5–11], one may conclude that the present Set
II of wave functions should be more favorable than Set I,
although the value CΣ
∆= 47% for the quark spin fraction
of proton obtained in Set II model is still larger than
experimental data.
The presently obtained quark spin fraction of the pro-
ton in the Set II model is very close to the numerical
result 0.46 predicted in [34] with contributions of only
the one-body axial current. It’s shown that the sim-
ple additive constituent quark model should violate the
partial conservation of the axial current (PCAC) condi-
tion [75, 76], so one has to take into account contribu-
tions of two-body axial exchange currents, which could
deduce the one-body axial current result by ∼40% [34],
and the obtained quark spin fraction of proton including
contributions from total currents is consistent with the
experimental data.
In Ref. [36], the authors employed a relativistic con-
stituent quark model, and took into account the one-
gluon-exchange eﬀects and the pion cloud contributions,
which resulted in that the quark OAM could contribute
about 62% to the nucleon spin. This value is close to the
presently obtained upper limit for the quark OAM in the
Set II model.
For the other octet baryons, as shown in Table III,
the baryon spin arisen from the intrinsic sea quark spin
shouldbelessthan10%,whilecontributionsoftheintrin-
sic seaquarkOAM to the baryonspin areabout 25 −28%
and 46−49%using the wavefunctions of Set I and Set II,
respectively. And one should note that the contributions
ofthevalencequarktospinofΣ, ΛandΞhyperonsinthe
present Set I model are 66%, 67% and 70%, respectively,
while in Set II model, the corresponding contributions7

In [77, 78], the quark spin contribution to the total
angular momentum of ﬂavor octet and decuplet ground
state baryons are studied using a spin-ﬂavor symmetry
based parametrization method of quantum chromody-
namics. The results for the quark spin fraction of the
ground state octet baryons in Ref. [77] is 0 .35(12), and
the value obtained in Ref. [78] is 0 .41(12), which values
are in general consistent with the presently obtained re-
sults.
In Ref. [79], the MIT bag model with corrections from
theone-gluon-exchangeandmeson-cloudeﬀectswereem-
ployed to evaluate the octet baryons spin fractions car-
ried by the valence quarks, and the obtained results were
42.6%, 58.9% and 65 .2% for the Σ, Λ and Ξ hyperons,
respectively. And in a very recent paper [80], the quark
spin content of SU(3) light and singly heavy baryons
were investigated using a pion mean-ﬁeld approach or
the chiral quark-soliton model, ﬂavor decomposition of
the axial charges of the baryons were studied explicitly,
the numerical results of the singlet axial charge for nu-
cleon are comparable with the present results in Set II
model, within 1 σ, while those for the other octet baryonsare smaller than the present results. And it’s predicted
that the composite quark spin should contribute about
44%, 46%, 42% and 41% to spin of nucleon, Σ, Λ and
Ξ, respectively, these values are also close to the present
results in Set II.
IV. SUMMARY
To summarize, in present work, we investigate the
quark orbital angular momentum of the ground octet
baryons employing the extended chiral constituent quark
model, in which the compact pentaquark higher Fock
componentsinbaryonsaretakenintoaccount. Theprob-
abilities of the higher Fock components are determined
by ﬁtting the data for the sea ﬂavor asymmetry of the
proton.
In present model, there are two sets of wave functions
forthepentaquarkhigherFockcomponentsintheground
octet baryons. These two sets of wave functions could
yield very diﬀerent probability amplitudes of the pen-
taquark components, as well diﬀerent quark orbital an-
gular momentum of the octet baryons. Our numerical8
results show that the quark angular momentum of the
nucleon should be about 0 .15−0.3, namely, the quark
angular momentum could contribute 30 −60% to the nu-
cleon spin. And the contributions of the intrinsic sea
quark spin to the nucleon spin are not large.
For the Λ, Σ, and Ξ hyperons, it’s very similar to the
nucleon, the spin of the intrinsic sea quark contributes
lessthan 10%totheir totalspin. And the obtained quark
angular momentum are in the range 0 .10-0.28, which are
a little smaller than that of the nucleon. And the corre-
sponding total spin arisen from the quark orbital angular
momentum is about 25 ∼50%.
