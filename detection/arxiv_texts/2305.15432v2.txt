In this work, we report the existence of nodal-arc , which acts as the building block of all the
nodal-rings in TaAs & TaP. This nodal-arc is found to be capable of generating all the nodal-rings
in these materials upon the application of space-group symm etry operations including time-reversal
symmetry. The arcs are obtained to be dispersive with the ene rgy spread of ∼109 (∼204) meV in
TaAs (TaP). Also, the orbitals leading to bands-inversion a nd thus the formation of nodal-arcs are
found to be Ta-5 d& As-4p(P-3p) in TaAs (TaP). The area of nodal-rings is found to be highly
sensitive to the change in hybridization-strength, where t he increase in hybridization-strength leads
to the decrease in the area of nodal-rings. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), all the
points on these arcs get gaped-up and two pairs of Weyl-nodes are found to evolve from them. Out
of the two pair, one is found to be situated close to the joinin g point of the two arcs forming a ring.
This causes the evolution of each nodal-ring into three pair s of Weyl-nodes. The coordinates of
these Weyl-nodes are found to be robust to the increase in SOC -strength from ∼0.7-3.5 eV. All the
results are obtained at the ﬁrst-principle level. This work provides a clear picture of the existence of
nodal-arc due to accidental degeneracy and its evolution into Weyl-no des under the eﬀect of SOC.
I. INTRODUCTION
Topological bands-crossings near the Fermi level
are of great importance in present condensed-matter
physics research. The popular classes of materials
associated with such bands-degeneracy includes- Weyl
semimetals (WSMs)1–4, Dirac-semimetals (DSMs)5–7
and nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs)8–10. The WSMs
contain discrete set of two-fold bands-intersections be-
tween conduction and valence bands across their full
Brillouin zone (BZ). They are associated with special
Fermi-arc surface states11,12. The DSMs possess dis-
crete set of four-fold conduction and valence bands-
touchings in their full BZ. The NLSMs are characterized
bythebands-crossingsneartheFermi-levelleadingtothe
formation of one-dimensional loop of bands-degeneracy.
Such loops are popularly referred as nodal-lines, nodal-
loops or nodal-rings. They are characterized by special
drumbhead-like surface states enclosed within the nodal-
lines. Apart from electronic states, topological bands-
touchings are also reported in phononic states of sev-
eral materials13,14. Generally, bands-touchings in WSMs
and NLSMs are due to accidental degeneracy which arise
from the proﬁle of the potential associated with these
materials15,16.
Another important aspect regardingthese materi-
alsisthenumberofsuchnodal-linesorWeyl-nodeswhich
are present in their full Brillouin zone (BZ). In this re-
gard, it also becomes important to ﬁnd-out the minimal
accidental degeneracy which can generate all the bands-
touching points in the full BZ upon applying the crys-
tal symmetry operations associated with the given ma-
terial. This minimal accidental degeneracy can be asso-
ciated with the irreducible parts of the BZ of the given
semimetals. This part of degeneracy must be consideredfrom fundamental degeneracy. The rest of the degen-
erate points in the full BZ are the consequences of the
symmetry operations in the reciprocal space and hence,
can be considered as derived one. In literature, a nodal-
loop is typically presented as a fundamental entity. If a
material contains more than one loop, the one of them is
generallyconsidered as a fundamental entity and the rest
of the loops are found to be related through symmetry
operations. However, one cannot rule out the possibility
that within one loop, a section of it is an independent
entity arising from fundamental degeneracy and the rest
part of it can be derived from crystal symmetry. To the
best of our knowledge, such discussion regardinga nodal-
loop is not yet been reported. It is important to mention
here that Dirac node arcs are reported to be observed in
certain materials17. In such works, Dirac node arc stands
for Dirac-like bands degeneracy along a line which is not
a closed loop. Such arcs are reported to be entirely a dif-
ferent entity and is nowayrelated with nodal-loop. Thus,
nodal-arc term as used in this work is entirely diﬀerent
from Dirac node arcs.
Now, we shall discuss some of the mechanisms
leading to the formation of nodal-lines. The well-known
conditions leading to their formation in the absence of
SOC includes- (i) due to band inversion of opposite par-
ity bands18, (ii) because of the simultaneous presence of
inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry (TR)9
and (iii) due to the presence of mirror symmetry and TR
symmetry19,20. Furthermore, in the presence of SOC,
the combination of mirror symmetry and TR symme-
try may also result in the formation of nodal-lines21. In
several cases, under the eﬀect of SOC, nodal-lines are re-
ported to evolve into diﬀerent topological states, such as-
WSM1,22, DSM23or NLSM24–26with a new set of nodal-
lines. Apart from the SOC-strength, new sets of degen-2
eracy also depends upon the crystal symmetries and or-
bital character. Also, the nodal-loop may either form at
constant energy or its diﬀerent part may be situated at
diﬀerent energy (dispersive in nature)27.
Now we explore the class of materials which show
nodal-lines forming due to band-inversion and under the
eﬀect of SOC, these nodal-lines are evolving into Weyl-
nodes. Some of the candidate materials of this class
include- (i) Co 3Sn2S2, in which there are several band-
inversions centered at the L-points resulting into the
formation of several nodal-rings located at the mirror
planes28. With the action of C3z-rotation and inversion
symmetries of the material, a total of six nodal rings is
reportedinitsBZ.Eachofthesenodal-ringsareextended
beyond the boundaries of ﬁrst BZ. Moving further, it is
shown that when SOC is taken into account, each nodal
rings are gaped out at all points except two, which form
a pair of Weyl-nodes. These Weyl-nodes are situated
at∼60 meV above Fermi-energy. Also, out of the two
Weyl-nodes generated from a nodal-ring, one is within
the ﬁrst BZ while the other is outside it. (ii) HfC, which
is reported to contain two types of nodal-rings encircling
the Γ and Mpoints, respectively29. One ring is encir-
cling the Γ-point and 6 rings, which are related with the
space-group symmetry of the material, are encircling the
sixM-points of the BZ. Thus, the ring encircling the Γ-
point and the ring enclosing one of the Mpoint can be
considered as related to fundamental degeneracy, as dis-
cussed in present work. The ring encircling the Γ-point is
perpendicular to the plane containingthe ringsencircling
theM-points. Also, ring encircling the Γ-point passes
through each of the rings enclosing the M-points to form
a structure popularly known as nodal-chain. The work
also shows that the nodal-ring encircling the M-point is
extended beyond the boundaries of the ﬁrst BZ. When
SOCistakeninto account, theringencirclingthe Γ-point
evolve into 6 pairs of Weyl-nodes while the ring enclosing
one ofthe M-points evolveinto 8 pairsofWeyl-nodes out
of which 4 are within the ﬁrst BZ and the rest are out-
side it. (iii) Mn 3Sn and Mn 3Ge, in which nodal-ring is
reported to be observed in the absence of SOC30. Also,
this work shows that SOC gaps these nodal rings but
leaves discrete band-touching points which are found to
be Weyl-nodes. However, this work does not highlight
the number of nodal-loop found in these materials. Fur-
thermore, the informationregardingthe numberofWeyl-
nodes which evolve from each nodal-loop is also missing.
(iv) TaAs class of WSMs, which are reported to show 4
gapless nodal rings in the mirror plane1,31. Furthermore,
these works highlight that under the eﬀect of SOC, each
nodal-rings evolve into 3 pairs of Weyl-nodes.
Above discussions clearly show the existence of a
nodal-ring due to accidental degeneracy. In the presence
of SOC, this nodal-ring is evolving into sets of Weyl-
nodes. This nodal-ring and associated Weyl-nodes can
be considered as arising from fundamental degeneracy as
mentioned earlier. The rest of the nodal-rings and asso-
ciated Weyl-nodes can be generated by applying symme-try operations and hence can be considered as derived
ones. Above study did not look at the possibility of
the existence of sets of k-points in the nodal-line form-
ing an arc as a fundamental entity, if the application of
space-groupsymmetry operations including the TR sym-
metry in the reciprocal space on this arc generates full
nodal-ring as well as other nodal-rings. Such arc in this
work is termed as nodal-arc . The possibility of the exis-
tenceofsuch nodal-arc willhelpinunderstandingtherole
of accidental degeneracy in the formation of number of
Weyl-nodes in a given material in a better way. Further-
more, the energy gap created at these nodal-arcs in the
presence of SOC is also not well explored. Investigating
this aspect will be helpful in understanding the evolution
Weyl-nodes from these nodal-arcs . Moreover, the infor-
mation about the orbitals involved in the band-inversion
in these materials is also lacking. Furthermore in case
of HfC, it is reported that beyond a critical strength
of SOC, the material changes its phase to topological
insulator29. Such a study of the materials response to
the strength of SOC is missing for other mentioned com-
pounds. Also, study of sensitivity of nodal-ring to the
change in hybridization-strength due to the variation in
latticeparametersismissingfortheabovementionedma-
terials. Such study will help in understanding the eﬀect
of pressure and strain on nodal-line and Weyl-nodes.
In this work we have made an attempt to address
the above mentioned issues related to the formation of
nodal-rings and their evolution into Weyl-nodes in the
presence of SOC in TaAs & TaP materials. Any such
attempts require the accurate ﬁnding of band-touching
pointsintermsoftheircoordinatesandenergy. Toensure
this, here we have used PY-Nodes code which is eﬃcient
in ﬁnding nodes using the ﬁrst-principle approach32.
This study clearly establishes out that each nodal-ring
is composed of two arcs out of which one is the nodal-arc
and other can be obtained from symmetry operations. In
the presence of SOC, the nodal-arc is evolving into two
pairs of Weyl-nodes out of which one is situated closer
to the middle of the nodal-arc and the other one at the
end which is also shared with the other arc forming the
nodal-ring. This causes the evolution of each nodal-ring
into three pairs of Weyl-nodes.
II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
The density functional theory (DFT) based cal-
culations are carried out using WIEN2k package33.
PBESol, which is based on generalised gradient approxi-
mation (GGA), is used as an exchange-correlation func-
tional in these computations34. Both the compounds
crystallize in body-centered tetragonal crystal structure
with the space group I41md35. The lattice constants
for TaAs36(TaP37,38) area=3.4824 ˚A &c=11.8038 ˚A
(a=3.3300 ˚A &c= 11.3900 ˚A). The Wyckoﬀ position of
Ta is (0,0,0) while for As & P, it is (0,0,u) with u=0.4176
(0.4160) for As (P)36–38. For both TaAs and TaP, the3
self-consistent ground state energy calculations are per-
formed over a k-mesh size of 10 ×10×10 with the charge
convergence limit set to 10−10Rydberg. Using these
ground state structures, the nodes-ﬁnding calculations
are carried out via PY-Nodes code32. This code is based
onNelder-Mead’s function minimization method. The
code is very eﬃcient in searching the accurate coordi-
nates of nodes using the ﬁrst-principle approach.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Formation of nodal-arc
First of all, we would like to investigate the pos-
sibility of the existence of nodal-arc arising as a result
of fundamental degeneracy. For this, a detailed analysis
of the formation of nodal-rings will be helpful. In this
direction, ﬁrstly the orbitals leading to bands-inversion
is explored. For this, the orbitals contributing to the
topmost valence band (TVB) and bottommost conduc-
tion band (BCB) of TaAs & TaP along the high sym-
metric directions Γ -N-Z-P-X- Γ-P-Nis investigated. It is
found that these bands are mostly contributed by Ta-5 d
and As-4 p/P-3porbitals. At the atomic level, the en-
ergy of Ta-5 dis higher than the energy of As-4 pand P-
3porbitals. This generally suggests that the TVB must
havehighercontributionfromAs-4 pandP-3pwhileBCB
must have higher contribution from Ta-5 d. The results
obtained from calculation of the character contribution
to these bands is shown in ﬁg. 1. It is seen that in all
the region, except a small one in the N−Zdirection,
the expected trend as discussed above is found to be fol-
lowed. Within this small region along N−Zdirection,
theorbitalcontributionisinvertedwhereTVBhashigher
contribution from Ta-5 dwhile BCB has higher contribu-
tion from As-4 pand P-3porbitals. Thus, band-inversion
is found to occur in this region. In this work, such a
character inversion within a band is referred as intraband
dp inversion (IDPI) . Such kind of band-inversion gener-
ally favours the occurrence of non-trivial band-crossings.
Also, as the character variation across the given high-
symmetric path is found to be exactly similar in TaAs
& TaP, identical bands-crossings is expected to occur in
both the materials. The calculations is carried out to
search for the bands-crossing. For both the materials,
four nodal-rings situated on the mirror planes deﬁned
bykx=0 andky=0 planes are obtained. In the further
investigation, these nodal-rings are found to be situated
around the N−Zdirection. Hence, exploringif the IDPI
is solely responsible for the formation of these rings is
required. In this regard, the character contribution to
TVB & BCB is studied within the plane containing the
nodal-ring. It is found that IDPIis occurring for the k-
points within the ring when compared with those outside
it. This clearly establishes that IDPIis leading to the
formation of these nodal-rings.

of nodal-rings in further details. The four nodal-rings
in these materials are related with space-group symme-
try operations. Thus, our analysis is concentrated over
a single ring. The energy of the nodal-rings in TaAs &
TaP is calculated and the obtained results are shown in
ﬁg. 2(a). It is found that these rings are not situated at
a constant energy but are spread withing a particular en-
ergyrange. Thetotal energyspreadin caseofTaP( ∼204
meV) is obtained to be nearly double than than in the
case of TaAs ( ∼109 meV). Apart from this, the obtained
energy of these rings is symmetric with respect to kz=0
plane. Thus, an extra symmetry, resulting from the com-
bined eﬀect ofmirrorsymmetry and the TR symmetry, is
there within the nodal-ring. This prevents us to consider
the ring as coming from fundamental degeneracy. How-
ever, portion of the ring surrounding the shaded region
does not involve any kind of symmetry operations. So,
it can be considered as nodal-arc which is arising due to
fundamentaldegeneracy. This nodal-arc in TaAsisfound
to be much more spread on the energy scale than in case
of TaP. The quantitative comparison of energy spread of
nodal-arc in TaAs & TaP is presented in ﬁg. 2(b). As
thenodal-arc is found to be the fundamental-degeneracy
in these materials, it must be capable of generating all
the rings upon the application of symmetry operations4

eration of other nodal-lines degeneracy from the nodal-
arcupon the application of symmetry operations asso-
ciated with these materials. The symmetry operations
associated with the primitive unit-cell of these materials
includes- (i) 4-fold rotation ( C4) symmetry across z=0
axis, (ii) mirror symmetry about x=0 plane, (iii) mir-
ror symmetry about y=0 plane and (iv) time-reversal
(TR) symmetry. These symmetry operations results in
the set of symmetries associated with the k-space which
includes- (i) C4symmetry across kz=0 axis, (ii) mir-
ror symmetry about kx=0 plane, (iii) mirror symmetry
aboutky=0 plane and (iv) degeneracy of states at kand
-kdue to TR symmetry39. Now let us apply these opera-
tions onnodal-arc to ﬁnd out other degenerate regions in
the BZ.Firstly, applicationof C4symmetryon the nodal-
arcinkx=0 plane generates another similar arc in ky=0
planewhichisshowninﬁg. 3(b). Nextly, theapplication
of mirror symmetry about ky=0 plane produces another
similararcinthe kx=0planebutinthenegativedirection
ofkyaxis. This is shown in ﬁg. 3(c). This operation has
no eﬀect on the blue arc situated on ky=0 plane since it
is lying on the mirror plane. Similarly, the application of
mirror symmetry operation across kx=0 plane generates
a blue arc on ky=0 plane but in the negative direction of
kxaxis. The resultant set of arcs produced due to these
operations is shown in ﬁg. 3(d). It is seen from the ﬁgure
that these arcs are situated in the negative direction of
kzaxis. Finally, consideringthe kand-kpoints degener-
acy due to TR symmetry results in the generation of four
other arcs in the positive kzaxis. All these arcs together
form four nodal-rings as shown in ﬁg. 3 (e). The four
nodal-lines generated in this way is found to be same as
those obtained from nodes calculations. This suggest the
existence of nodal-arc as basic units for the creation of
all the four rings found in these materials.

denotes the topological space and Grepresents a group.
LetYdenotes the discrete subgroup of G. Then a fun-

Thus, the elements of Gwill be{I,C4,Mx,My,MxMy,

ferent region of the BZ. Arcs obtained from all the eight

B. Evolution of nodal-arc to Weyl-nodes
Analysis of the energy gap created at the nodal-
arcdue to SOC may be a helpful step towards exploring
its evolution into Weyl-nodes. The obtained results in
this regard for TaAs & TaP are shown in ﬁg. 4. The gap
created at each point of the arc is found to be not of uni-
form magnitude. This indicates that the SOC-strength
in these materials is k-dependent. However, the energy
gap along these nodal-arcs is obtained to be systematic
in nature. Along the increasing direction of ky, the gap
is found to ﬁrst decrease to attain a minimum non-zero
value. This value corresponds to 7.7 (5.6) meV in TaAs
(TaP). On further increase in the value of ky, the energy
gap again starts rising. The maximum value of the gap
obtainedinTaAs(TaP)isfoundtobe162.0(143.7)meV.
Before moving further, it is important to highlight here
that these nodal-arcs are found to be extended beyond
the boundaries of the ﬁrst BZ. The results regarding this
is shown in ﬁg. 5. Here, the red arcdenotes the nodal-arc
which along with the black arc completes the nodal-ring.
Furthermore, when the red and black arcs are mapped
to ﬁrst BZ, the blue and green colored arcs are obtained,
respectively. While major portions of these new arcs are
situated at the same points as the red & black arcs, some
parts of it are found in entirely new region as indicated
in the ﬁgure. This veriﬁes the extension of nodal-arcs
beyond the ﬁrst BZ. It is important to mention here that
thereareinconsistencyintheresultsregardingthespatial
extent of nodal-rings of these materials in the literature.
Several works predict that these rings are not extended
beyond the boundaries of ﬁrst BZ11,22,41. On the other
hand, some other results indicate that such loops extend
beyondtheﬁrstBZ42,43. Theﬁndingsinthepresentwork
regarding nodal-arc ensures that the nodal-rings in these
materials are extended beyond the boundaries of ﬁrst
BZ. Also, it must be noted here that the term nodal-arc
in further discussions will refer to regions obtained after
mapping the previously deﬁned nodal-arc to the ﬁrst BZ.
Now moving further, although SOC destroys the nodal-
arcdegeneracy in these materials, it is found to create
four new degenerate points close to the plane contain-
ing thenodal-arc . These points correspond to two pairs
of Weyl-nodes. The coordinates of Weyl-nodes evolving
from the nodal-arc and the other arc which together form-0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6

a nodal-ring is shown in ﬁg. 6. The two nodes forming a
Weyl pair are found to be situated on either sides of the
nodal-arc and also perpendicular to the plane containing
the arc. Furthermore, one pair of Weyl-nodes is situated
closer to the middle of the nodal-arc and the other one
is obtained at the end as shown in the ﬁgure. In this
way, one nodal-arc is found to evolve into two pairs of
Weyl-nodes. However, the pair which is situated closer
to the end of the nodal-arc has the shared contribution
from both the arc forming the ring. This is because it is
situated closer to the joining-point of both the arcs form-
ing the ring, which can be seen from the ﬁgure. Thus,
both the arcs forming the ring are found to collectively
evolve into 3 pairs of Weyl-nodes. This discussion pro-
vides a justiﬁcation for the evolution of each nodal-ring
into three pairs of Weyl-nodes in these WSMs. The next
point of discussion here is whether the strength of SOC
aﬀects the number of Weyl-nodes into which these arcs
evolve. This is discussed further.
The SOC Hamiltonian ( Hso) is inversely propor-
tional to c2, where cis the velocity of light44. In the
present work, the value of cis changed to vary the
strength of SOC in the calculations. The ground state
energycalculationsin the presence ofSOC are performed
using three diﬀerent values of c: 137.03, 130.18 & 123.32.
These values are in atomic units. For both the materi-
als, the strength of SOC obtained corresponding to these
values of care mentioned in table I. It is to be noted6
here that SOC-strength is calculated by ﬁnding the dif-
ference between the total energy per Ta atom obtained
before and after the inclusion of SOC. It is seen that
with the decrease in the value of cfrom∼137 to∼123,
the strength of SOC in TaAs (TaP) increases from ∼0.7
eV (∼0.7 eV) to ∼3.4 eV (∼3.5 eV). The evolution of
nodal-arc into Weyl-nodes under the eﬀect of these three
diﬀerent strength of SOC is studied for these materials.
Corresponding to these strength of SOC, the nodal-arcs
in TaAs & TaP are found to evolve into only two pairs
of Weyl-nodes. Thus, the given change in SOC-strength
has no eﬀect on the number of Weyl-nodes into which
the arcs are evolving. The coordinates and energy of
one node from each pair are mentioned in table I. Since
both the points forming the Weyl pair is at equidistant
from the plane containing the nodal-arc , only one is men-
tioned in the table. Also, the Weyl-nodes, which is situ-
ated closer to the end of the nodal-arc is indicated as W1
point while the one closer to the middle of the arc is indi-
cated as W2 point in the table. It is found that with the
increase in the strength of SOC, the coordinates of the
Weyl-nodes remained same in both the WSMs. However,
the energy of W1 and W2 points changes considerably.
As can be seen from the table, with the given increase in
strength of SOC, the W1 & W2 points of TaAs (TaP) are
getting far-from (closer-to) each other in terms of their
energy. For instance, with the increase in SOC-strength
from∼0.7 eV to ∼3.0 eV, the energy gap between W1-
W2 points gets changed from 0.77 (65.32) meV to 11.79
(54.68) meV in case of TaAs (TaP).
As mentioned in the introduction, HfC, a WSM
candidate, shows phase transition from WSM to topolog-
ical insulator when strength of SOC is increased beyond
a certain limit ( ∼1 eV)29. However, similar behaviour
is not observed in case of TaAs & TaP. The existence
of Weyl-nodes in these materials are found to be robust
against much stronger SOC-strength, more than 3 times,
as compared to that for HfC. It is found that Weyl-nodes
in TaAs (TaP) remain intact at their position for the in-
crease in the SOC-strength from ∼0.75 (∼0.72) eV to
∼3.39 (∼3.51) eV. These results highlight that within
the range of ∼0.7-3.5 eV, SOC-strength is acting at per-
turbative level on the top of non-SOC Hamiltonian of
these materials. Thus, this strength of SOC may not be
enough to create the gap at the Weyl-nodes.
C. Eﬀect of hybridization-strength on IDPIand
nodal-rings
The change in lattice parameters aﬀects the inter-
atomic distances and hence the hybridization-strength of
atomic orbitals. This will certainly aﬀect the charac-
ter contributions to the states associated with any given
bands. As the IDPIis closely related to the character
contributions to the TVB & BCB, it becomes necessary
to ﬁnd-out if IDPIis sensitive to change in lattice pa-
rameters. In this direction, the calculations of charactera=b=3.4824

contributions of Ta-5 d& As-4pto TVB & BCB is car-
ried out for TaAs by varying the lattice parameters from
-4% to 4% in the step of 2% from the experimental value.
Corresponding to all these sets, the band-character cal-
culations show that IDPIoccurs along N-Zdirection in
TVB and BCB. The obtained results are shown in ﬁg. 7.
It is seen from the ﬁgure that with the increase in the
lattice parameters, the spatial extent of the IDPI, inN-Z
direction, decreases. Similar results have been also ob-
tained for TaP. These observations clearly indicate that
extent of IDPIin TaAs and TaP is extremely sensitive to
the change in lattice parameters. It is already discovered
that thenodal-arc and hence the nodal-ringsin these ma-
terialsisresultingfrom IDPI.Thus, abovediscussionsug-
gests that the size of nodal-rings in these materials must
reduce with the increase in the value of lattice param-
eters. In this direction, further investigation is carried
out and the obtained results are discussed below. For the
above mentioned values of lattice parameters, nodal-ring
calculations are performed for TaAs & TaP. For both the
materials, one of the nodal-rings obtained in kx=0 plane
for diﬀerent values of lattice parameters are compared.
Corresponding plots for TaAs & TaP are shown in ﬁg.
8(a) and 8(b), respectively. It is seen from these ﬁgures
that with the increase in the lattice parameters, the size
of nodal-ring decreases for both the materials. Thus, the
results obtained are found to be consistent with the pre-
diction made above. Furthermore, it is obvious that the
change in lattice parameters will result in the change in
the volume of the primitive unit cell and the Ta-As/Ta-
P bond-length. The variation of the area of nodal-line
and the bond-length with the change in volume of the
primitive unit cell, for both the materials, is shown in
ﬁg. 8(c). It is seen from the ﬁgure that with the increase
in primitive unit cell volume of both the materials, the
bond-length of Ta-As & Ta-P linearly increases whereas
the area of nodal-line linearly decreases. The rate of de-
creasein the area of nodal-line with the increase in bond-

increase in bond-length from 2.59 to 2.64 ˚A, the area of
nodal-ring in TaAs decreases from 0.179 to 0.170. Here,

have no units. Moving further, for the same change in
the bond-length in TaP, the area of nodal-ring decreases
from 0.174 to 0.163. Thus, with the same increase in
the bond-length, increase in the hybridization-strength
in TaP is comparatively higher than TaAs. These ob-
servations indicate the role of hybridization of atomic
orbitals in the occurrence of IDPIand the formation of
nodal-rings. This is explicitly discussed further.
As already discussed, TVB & BCB in TaAs (TaP)
are mostly contributed by Ta-5 dand As-4 p(P-3p) or-
bitals. When atoms are very far from each other, BCB
(b1) will have only contributions from Ta-5 dwhile theTVB (b2) will be contributed by As-4 p/P-3p. In that
case, these bands will be non-dispersive as shown in ﬁg.
9 (a). When the atoms come closer, their atomic or-
bitals will overlap resulting in the hybridization. This
will make these bands dispersive and bring them closer
to each other as shown in ﬁg. 9 (b). With the further
decrease in the inter-atomic distances, the overlapping
and hence hybridization-strength will increase and the
bands will approach each other to a greater extent to
form a touching point or node. This is shown in ﬁg.
9 (c). In similar manner, any further increase in the
hybridization-strength will result in the crossing of these
bands to form a nodal-ring, which can be seen in ﬁg. 9
(d). It is intuitive from the ﬁgure that with further rise
in hybridization-strength, the size of nodal-ring will in-
crease. In this way, hybridization ofatomic orbitals leads
to the formation of nodal-rings. This also explains why
decrease in the bond-length is resulting into the increase
in the area of nodal-rings.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, several aspects regarding nodal-lines
and its evolution into Weyl-nodes in TaAs & TaP are ex-
ploredusingthe ﬁrst-principle approach. Theseincludes-
(i)orbitalsresponsibleforbands-inversion,(ii) possibility
of the existence of nodal-arc which generates full nodal-
ring and other rings upon the application of symmetry
operations, (iii) energy spread of such nodal-arcs , (iv)
eﬀect of SOC on these arcs, (v) number of Weyl-nodes
evolving from these nodal-arcs under the eﬀect of SOC,
(vi) eﬀect of change in SOC-strength on the Weyl-nodes
and (vi) sensitivity of the nodal-rings to the change in
hybridization-strength. The orbitals leading to band-
inversion are obtained as Ta-5 d& As-4p(P-3p). The
nodal-ring is found to be formed from a nodal-arc and
another arc which is related to the nodal-arc through the
combinationofmirror-symmetryand TRsymmetry. The
arc in TaAs (TaP) is found to be spread within ∼109 (∼
204) meV around the Fermi-level. These nodal-arcs get
fully gaped under the eﬀect of SOC. The maximum value
of the gap obtained in TaAs (TaP) is found to be 161.95
(143.66) while the minimum value corresponds to 7.68
(5.58) meV. SOC leads to the evolution of nodal-arc into
2 pairs of Weyl-nodes whose coordinates are found to
be robust to the change in SOC-strength from ∼0.7-3.5
eV. The nodal-rings are found to be highly sensitive of
the change in hybridization-strength. Increase in bond-
length from 2.59 to 2.64 ˚A reduces the area of nodal-ring
from 0.179 (0.174) to 0.170 (0.163) in TaAs (TaP). The
ﬁndings of this work make the picture more clear regard-
ing the role of accidental degeneracy in the formation of
nodal-rings and the Weyl-nodes in TaAs & TaP.
