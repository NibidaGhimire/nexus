In this work, the concept of optical identification (OI) based on physical unclonable function is introduced for the 
first time , to our knowledge,  in optical communication systems and networks . The OI assigns an optical fingerprint 
and the corresponding digital representatio n to each sub -system of the network  and estimates  its reliability in 
different measures. We highlight the large potential applications of OI as a physical layer approach for security, 
identification, authentication , and monitoring purposes. To identify most of the sub-systems  of a network, we 
propose to use the Rayleigh  backscattering patter n, which is an optical physical unclonable function and allows to 
achieve OI with a simple procedure and without additional devices. The application of OI to fiber and path 
identification in a network, and to the authentication of the user s in a quantum key distribution system are 
described . 
  
 
1. INTRODUCTION   
 
The rapid growth of global communication networks around the globe  
requires optimal network security protocols .  
Each layer of the open systems interconnection (OSI) , which descr ibes 
how different layers communicate in a network,  contributes to the 
overall security of the network , which includes secure communication, 
authentication, identification, and monitoring.  Figure 1 depicts the 
security protocols that can be applied to the  layers of the OSI, briefly 
described below . The application layer , which is the layer with which  
most  of the users interact, may include end -to-end cryptography , e.g., 
Outlook, and  WhatsApp messages are encrypted to be recognized just 
by users.  Also, the presentation and session layers, which are 
responsible for syntax processing and creating communicatio n 
channels between devices, respectively, may profit from data 
cryptography.  The transport layer, which is responsible for the 
transmission of data across network connections, may use secure 
sockets layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS) protocols t hat 
include authentication between parties, data integrity, and digital 
signature . The network layer, which handles the routing of the data, is responsible for security at the network level and uses  functions such as 
packet authentication, cryptography, an d integrity , e.g., Internet 
protocol security (IPsec). The data link layer uses admission controls to 
check and guarantee the proposed connection,  for example, w ireless 
systems developed Wi -Fi protected access (WPA ). Concerning the 
physical layer,  usually,  security is not implemented because establishing 
optimal security protocol s at this level is still an open worldwide 
problem . Although the upper layers are liable to  security and 
confidentiality , implementing a security protocol on the physical layer 
could significantly  enhance  the network's security .  Potential attacks 
that target the physical layer  are include d tampering ( which introduces 
fake nodes), jamming ( which introduc es harmful signals in the 
network), side -channel attacks  (when the adversary  gets physical 
access to the device ), physical infrastructure attacks, and 
eavesdropping.  Hence , physical layer security (PLS) is a crucial  element 
that can enhance the overall security of the network s.  Although PLS 
cannot prevent such attacks,  however, it might detect such attacks and 
warn the users . To establish PLS several methods have been proposed 
and studied.  The very first technique based on information theoretic 
characterizations of secrecy for PLS is the Wyner technique which is 
defined by the wiretap channel model  [1]. The  Wyner technique limits 
the information to an eavesdropper by using the channel capaci ty difference between a target receiver and an eavesdropper, defining 
positive secrecy capacity only if the target receiver has better signal -to-
noise ratio (SNR ) than the eavesdropper, which makes this technique 
unsecured.  An adversary with high -performa nce devices can receive 
higher SNR than the target receiver. The eavesdropper attack may be 
neutralized, by transmitting the artificial noise to reduce its channel 
capacity, only if the attacker's position is known [ 2]. Since then, various 
research has bee n done in this area, and most of them that guarantee 
security is based on suited encoding and complicated modulation 
schemes [ 3,4].  
 
 
Fig. 1. Security along Open system interconnection (OSI) levels. The 
target of our proposed met hod in this paper is to implement a novel ID 
technique for physical layer security . 
The PLS techniques  based on computational cryptograp hy rely on 
computational hardness but  are vulnerable to digital attacks  (e.g., Brut 
force attack) . Quantum key distribution (QKD) [ 5,6] provides  intrinsic 
security, but (i) is not cost -effective , (ii) is hard to be implemented , and 
(iii) relies on user authentication usually performed with classical 
techniques . Also, the PLS based on keys generated by digital signal  
processing (DSP)  [7] is vulnerable to digital attacks . Recently, a n 
approach based on optical steganography was proposed to hide 
messages below the noise level [8,9]. However,  this technique cannot 
detect the presence  of an eavesdropper  and is vulnerab le to adversaries 
who know the technique  [10,11]. PLS-based optical chaos 
communication [ 12,13] requires high -level synchronization between 
the transmitter and the receiver [ 14] and its  security can be broken in 
some scenarios [15].   
A new approach to PLS is based on the material's physical features, 
defined by physical unclonable functions (PUFs), in which a physical 
device provides unique output for a given input [ 16]. The security of this 
method relies on the intrinsic unclonab ility of the PUF [ 17-19], and, 
therefore, is able to overcome the disadvantages of computational 
cryptography . Optical PUFs (OPUFs), PUF defined in the optical domain, 
have been recently studied  [20-23]. Even though OPUFs have been 
investigated for  secure cryptography key generation, they were never 
employed in a real system as a practical security solution  [24].  
The concept of optical fingerprint has been recently proposed to 
exploit the inherent characteristics of some physical devices [ 25-27]. In 
these works, classification and identification are obtained in limited 
scenarios, through training processes using specific equipment, and 
without strong reliability in terms of unclonability and security . 
Despite all the effort a forementioned to imp lement PLS, it  is still an 
open problem . Indeed, o ptical fibers , which constitute the larger part of 
the physical layer, are distributed around the globe and are vulnerable 
to adversarial attack s, whose capabilities are growing day by day thanks 
to the use  of high -performance devices or exploiting intensive machine 
learning algorithms. In this paper , we propose a novel method to ensure 
network security : optical  identification (OI). The OI is based on the 
Rayleigh backscattering pattern (RBP) extracted from  an optical fiber, which is a strong OPUF  [28]. The proposed  method can be used for 
communication  security, authentication, identification, and monitoring , 
both  in point -to-point communication and optical network s. In 
particular, OI protects sub -systems’ communication since it allows their 
physical identification. Indeed, any physical attack which affects fibers, 
fiber connections, or inserts optical devices (e.g ., optical 
couplers/splitters) changes the system RBP, thus changing the system 
signature. For instance, spoofing, tampering, jamming [ 29], and 
eavesdropping  attacks [ 30] modify the system signature and reveals the 
presence of an imposter.  
This manuscript is organized as follows . In Section 2, we introduce the 
concept of  optical  identification and its security validation. In Section 3, 
we introduce the concept of optical physical unclonable function, and 
we describe the Rayleigh  backscattering. Next, Sectio n 4 describes some 
potential applications of the OI concepts, and Section 5  provides some 
examples. Finally, Section 6 draws conclusions.  
2. OPTICAL IDENTIFICATION   
A. Concept  
 
Not only humans but also physical elements have their own 
fingerprint s. In general, the fingerprint (equivalently, signature) of a 
device, system,  or sub -system, denoted below as ID, is related to its 
physical characteristics and caused by imperfections in the 
manufactur ing process. In this manuscript , we propose  to exploit the 
inherent characteristics of fiber network systems to produce an 
unclonable  fingerprint to be used for security purposes, a concept that 
has not been exploited  in communication systems and networks. We 
refer to this concept as optical identi fication  (OI) and we briefly describe 
it in the following.  
A point -to-point scenario, sketched in Fig ure 2(a), is made of three sub -
systems: transmitter , channel, and receiver. Let us denote  the signatures 
of these three sub-systems as IDTX, ID Ch, and ID RX, respectively.  In this 
case, three possible security approaches may be envisaged: (i) the 
transmitter reads ID Ch and ID RX to be sure that the information passes  
the expected  channel and reaches the expected  receiver, (ii) the receiver 
reads ID TX and ID Ch to be sure who is the sender and which is the 
physical path, (iii) the transmitter reads ID RX and the receiver acquires 
IDTX so that both know to whom they are talking  (they can also acquire  
IDCh to check the path ).   
 
Fig 2. (a) A point -to-point commun ications system. (b) Example of 
network architecture.  
In a network scenario with 𝑁 sub-systems, sketched in Figure 2 (b), 
each sub-system may be identified by its signature, labeled as 𝐼𝐷𝑖 where 
1≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑁 represents the 𝑖-th sub-system . In an optical network, sub -
systems may include transceivers, optical fibers, optical nodes, filters, 
optical cross -connects, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers, 
etc.  
The ID of each sub -system, both in a point -to-point scenario or the  
network s cenario, can be generated and stored in a database. Each sub -
system is identified by comparing its ID with the corresponding stored 
copy, and correct identification is characterized by probability   𝑝𝑖. In a 
network scenario, any sub -system may be able to  identify another sub -
system in the network and, eventually, validate the whole path. Let us 
consider the bold path in Figure 2 (b). If the sub -system with ID 1 is able 
to evaluate the probability of each path and these paths are 
independent, each sub -system  can be independently interrogated, and 
the probability of the whole path becomes : 
𝑝=∏ 𝑝𝑖 𝑖𝜖{𝑝𝑎𝑡 ℎ}                                                    (1) 
The above model allows us not only to validate each sub -system and 
the path but also to identify whether any changes occurred in the path 
and where . However, the acquisition of the signature of the sub -system 
is not independent. Consequently,  a more comple x model based on the 
specific technique used for identification must be developed.  
B. Security validation  
 
The ID of each sub -system can be represented by a vector of bits , the 
digital representation of the signature. For the sake of brevity, we will 
refer to this as digital signature . How this digital signature is obtained 
depends on the specific implementation, and some examples are given 
in the next sections.  
It is important to underline that, even if the physical signature is 
unclonable, its digital r epresentation loses  this property. As a 
consequence, is essential to be able to assess the accuracy and strength 
of a signature generation method. Below, we describe how to perform 
the identification of a binary signature, and how to assess its strength.  
Let us assume there are two users U and V , in a point -to-point 
communication, each with their digital signature with 𝑁 bits. To 
compare t wo signatures, we use the inter -Hamming distance (HD), 
which counts the number of different bits among the two signatures.  
Assuming that the bits of each signature are independent and 
identically distributed and that  𝑝 is the probability of having different 
bits in the two IDs, the HD of two signatures  is distributed as a binomial 
distribution with 𝑁 trials and mean value 𝑁𝑝. This means that when 
two IDs are independently generated, 𝑝=0.5 and the mean is 𝑁/2. 
Conversely, when two IDs are not dissimilar  (which happens when  they 
represent the same sub-system ) a few bits should be flipped to obtain 
one from the other, i.e., 𝑝 and the HD s are small. Consequently, the 
decision rule is: if HD is below a certain threshold 𝑡, we assume that the 
two IDs represent the same user; conversely, if the HD is larger than 𝑡, 
we assume that the IDs belong to different users.  
This concept is illustrated in Figure 3, which reports the probability of 
the HD between the IDs of the users U and V with the stored ID of the 
user U. The figure serves only for illustration purposes and, therefore, 
we do not report the scale on the axis  or the system setup . The figure 
shows that the mean of the HD for U, denoted as  𝑀𝑈, is much lower than 
the one for V, denoted as  𝑀𝑉. The threshold 𝑡 can be defined as  
𝑡=𝛾𝑀𝑉+(1−𝛾)𝑀𝑈                                        (2) 
where  0≤𝛾≤1. The success or failure of the procedure depends not only on intrinsic 
physical limitations and inaccuracies (e.g., the amount of noise in the 
RBP acquisition) but also on the post -processing method i.e., signatur e 
definition and decision rule (e.g., the number of bits). The procedure fails 
when a false negative or a false positive occurs. On the one hand, a false 
negative “U rejected” occurs when U is the user, but the procedure fails, 
and he is rejected (the HD is larger than 𝑡). This is a matter of 
identification, w hich can be partly mitigated by repeating the 
identification protocol several times. On the other hand, a false positive 
“V accepted” occurs when the user is V (different from U), but the 
procedure fails, and V is identified as U (the HD is smaller than 𝑡). This is 
a matter of security  and authentication. In general, while is it desirable 
to minimize both the probability of false negative and false positive, one 
can tailor 𝑡  to the system requirements: if 𝑡 decreases, the security 
improves (the probabil ity of false positive decreases) at the expense of 
identification capabilities (the probability of false negative increases). 
The probability of failure (the sum of the probability of false positive and 
false negative) can be evaluated (i) estimating by si mulations the mean 
of the HD of the right user  𝑀𝑈 (two signatures of U) and of the wrong 
user  𝑀𝑉 (the signature of U and the signature of V) (ii) considering the 
two binomial distributions with 𝑁 trial, and probability of success 
𝑀𝑈/𝑁 and 𝑀𝑉/𝑁, respectively, and (iii) estimating the probability of 
false positive as:  
∑ (𝑛
𝑘)(𝑀𝑉
𝑁)𝑘
(1−𝑀𝑉
𝑁)𝑁−𝑘𝐻𝐷
𝑘=0                        (3) 
and the probability of a false negative as:  
∑ (𝑛
𝑘)(𝑀𝑈
𝑁)𝑘
(1−𝑀𝑈
𝑁)𝑁−𝑘∞
𝑘=𝐻𝐷                    (4) 
          
 
Fig. 3. Probability of HD of two users . The false positive and false 
negative regions are highlighted, depending on the decision rule.   
Depending on the scenario and type of signature, it is str aightforward 
to use quick response ( QR) codes to represent signatures (simply binary 
matrices). In this case, the robustness of the method  also can be 
evaluated by considering  the inner  HD and the intra -HD, as in  [31].  
These two are useful to demonstrate the robustness of the signature 
against a digital forecasting attack and to demonstrate ID 
reproducibility.  Inner HD is the HD of a pair of 1D segments in the QR 
code that should not be too smaller or bigger than half of  the size of the 
segment length to be robust against digital attacks.  
Intra-HD is the HD of several repeated measure s of the same sub -
system, and should be low to indicate the  reproducibility of the ID . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. OPTICAL PUF   
A. Concept  
 
A physical unclonable function (PUF) is, by definition, a function that, 
under specific circumstances and for a given input  (referred to as 
challenge ) provides a unique output ( respon se) that results to be 
unclonable  [32]. The uniqueness of the signature is a physica l 
characteristic of the PUF, usually due to the imperfection s of the 
manufactur ing process. A PUF can be generated by physical objects, like 
the communication and network sub -systems, e.g., sensors, integrated 
circuits, and hardware in general.  In a nutshell, PUFs provide a 
signature, or fingerprint [ 33], of physical devices, which can be used f or 
security applications.  
A PUF is a black -box function  𝐹(⋅) which provides a unique 
output, the response   𝑅=𝐹(𝐶), given a s input the challenge  𝐶. 
We refer to the pair  𝐶 and 𝑅 as the challenge -response pair 
(CRP).  Figure 4 sketches how two different PUFs A and B (with 
functions  𝐹𝐴(⋅) and  𝐹𝐵(⋅)) respond to two different challenges  𝐶1 
and 𝐶2. On the one hand, given two different challenges  𝐶1 and 
𝐶2, the responses of the same PUF A , 𝐹𝐴(𝐶1) and 𝐹𝐴(𝐶2), are 
different . On the other hand, the same challenge   𝐶2 provides two 
different responses  𝐹𝐴(𝐶2) and 𝐹𝐵(𝐶2), when using two different 
PUFs.   
Soft PUFs are used for PUFs with limited number of challenges, while 
strong PUFs are used for PUFs with a large number of  challenges. In the 
latter case,  generally , the complete determination of the CRP is not 
possible in a feasible way. The property of uniqueness is defined by 
means of the inter -Hamming distance  of the outputs,  that is how 
different are the responses of dis tinct PUFs.  The reliability of a PUF is  the 
ability  to provide  the same response for a given challenge; this is 
measured by the intra - Hamming distance, which is the HD among two 
responses to the same challenge and should ideally be equal to zero; 
while  steadiness indicates the variability of the  response due to changes 
in the circumstances e.g., temperature, power supply or aging effect  
[34].  
Different kinds of PUFs exist, some of which are described  in the 
following. T he system presented in [ 35] is one of the first examples  of a 
strong optical PUF. In this case, an input laser beam is directed towards 
a stationary scattering medium and  then the speckle output pattern is 
recorded. The laser XY location and its polarization constitute the 
challenge while the response is the associated speckle pattern. Such a 
pattern is strongly dependent on the input location/polarization due to 
the fact that multiple scattering events can occur inside the scattering 
medium. Conversely, the power -on state of a static random access 
memory  (SRAM)  is a soft PUF. In fact, though an SRAM cell is symmetric, 
manufacturing anomalies can induce a tendency toward a logical ‘‘1’’ or 
‘‘0’’ when the power is switched on. This variability is random across the 
entire SRAM and can determine  a univocal fingerprint. Another 
interesting example of soft PUF is obtained in the case of digital image 
(video) acquisition. When a photo is acquired, the camera sensor, which 
is composed of a two -dimensional array of charge -coupled  devices 
(CCDs ), is hit by light photons and this energy is then converted into 
electron charges. Due to manufacturing imperfections, each cell of such 
a sil icon sensor differently answers to a uniform incoming light. 
Consequently, this results in the superimposition, in each content it 
takes (images and/or videos), of a systematic noise, named photo 
response non -uniformity noise ( PRNU ) [36]. The PRNU  is not 
perceivable and does not degrade the visual quality of the acquired contents,  but it constitutes a fingerprint that is embedded within the 
image pixels  and can be used for source identification .  
Overall, it is evident that PUFs have strong characteristics that can be 
used for optical  identification ( OI). For example, PUF s can be used for  
authentication purposes, by storing a database  of CRPs (𝐶𝑖,𝑅𝑖). 
Furthermore, PUFs can be used as a cryptogr aphic root key for a device, 
such that key injection is not required , and the key cannot be copied  and 
does  not need to be stored but is simply recovered from the device when 
necessary.  
However, despite the advantages, PUFs are anyway prone to security 
issues and should be carefully tackled in relation to the application 
scenario.  
 
 
Fig. 4 Challenge -response pairs (CRPs).  
B. Rayleigh backscattering as an OPUF  
 
The Rayleigh backscattering that occurs when stimulating optical 
fibers with propagating light is an OPUF  response , due to the random 
density fluctuations caused by the fabrication process  [28]. Therefore, 
we propose to use the Rayleigh back scatter ing pattern (RB P) as a 
signature of the optical fiber, which allows  us not only to id entify the 
fiber link but any optical and opto -electronic sub -systems through their 
pigtail.   
RBP  acquisition can be done using the optical frequency domain 
reflectometry (OFDR) technique  with sub -millimeter -level spatial 
resolution [ 36-40]. Furthermore,  it is known that due to the sensing 
capability of OFDR, the RBP is  robust against changes in temperature or 
strain [ 28]. 
 In this work, we consider the c oherent OFDR (C -OFDR) since it allows 
us to increase the sensitivity and resolution  [41,44]. 
C-OFDR  is implemented as follows . The light from a continuous wave 
(CW) laser  with amplitude 𝐸0, whose frequency is linearly  swept in time 
with sweep rate 𝛾, propagates into the fiber under test ( FUT). The RBP  
is the photocurrent obtained after self -coherent balance detection , as 
sketched in Fig ure 5 , and can be modeled as  
𝐼(𝑡)=𝐸02∑ √𝑅𝑘𝑛
𝑘=1 𝑐𝑜𝑠(2𝜋𝛾𝑡𝜏𝑘)                     (5) 
whe n there are 𝑛 reflection points with reflect ivity 𝑅𝑘 and roundtrip 
time 𝜏𝑘 [28,44].  For the sake of simplicity, a responsivity of 1 is 
assumed. The photocurrent in Eq.  (5) is acquired with an analog -to-
digital  converter (ADC) and can be used for optical identification 
purposes. For example, using a single -bit ADC (or digitally emulating it), 
one can directly use the security validation method in Section 2B. 
We remark that the RBP in (5) is the response of the OPUF, which 
depends on the challenge applied. Consequently, any fiber possesses 
several diff erent fingerprints, each depending on the applied challenge. 
This is a key aspect for optical identification, since it protects from the 
reproduction of the fingerprint without knowledge of the challenge, as 
specified below . 
The major feature provided by the RBP is its unclonability, which 
intrinsically protects against spoofing attacks. Indeed, spoofing, which 
consists in faking the ID and identifying it as another sub -system, 
requires either replacing legitimate fiber or gen erating a fake signal. On 
the one hand, if the legitimate fiber is replaced, it causes a different RBP 
(even if the adversary uses the correct challenge) because the RBP is a 
PUF response and is unique for each fiber, and the signatures do not 
match. On th e other hand, RBP is measured through a self -coherent 
receiver where the same laser is used as the source and local oscillator. 
Therefore, since laser phase and wavelength cannot be predicted or 
fully measured, RBP reproduction is avoided . 
It is important to note that fiber fingerprint (signature) defines based 
on the specific challenge that applies to the fiber . Consequently, any fiber 
can possess several different fingerprints that define implementing 
various challenges. That is a significant fact that ca uses a high -security 
level for the generated signature. Since fingerprint is dependent on the 
challenge, an adversary that has access to the fiber cannot generate the 
signature without applying the related challenge. Accordingly, the 
response (signature) m ust be stored in the database along with the 
related challenge and constitute the (CRP) database for the 
identification approach, as is illustrated in Figure 1 2-13. It is worth 
noting that applying one challenge on different fibers results in various 
respo nses, as explained in section 3. A, every single fiber has its unique 
response.

4. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS  
A. Physical layer security  in classical communications  
 
In this section, the possibilities and challenges of optical identification  
(OI) – or more in general of fingerprints – are discussed. The RBP of an 
optical fiber is an OPUF , and, therefore, each fiber can be  characterized 
by a fingerprint . This fingerprint  can be obtained, for example, offline 
before the fiber installation, having access to an end of the fiber. Let us 
assume that the operator maintains a database with the fingerprints of all fibers in the network, thus having awareness of all installed fibers. In 
this way , unauthorized access  to the network can be revealed.  We can 
assume that an operator may be aware of the fingerprint of its fibers 
over an infrastructure (e.g., before the installation of the infrastructure). 
Thus, assuming that each fiber is known, the operator can periodically 
perform checks (e.g., from the node ports) and reveal if some intrusion 
has been performed (e.g., some fiber has been replaced with some other 
fiber). The intrusion can be then revealed through the proposed method 
when an unknown fingerprint is detected  
 In particular, potential applications are the identification of tampering 
(consisting of making fake nodes) or jamming (introducing harmful 
signals in the network). Indeed, fibers – e.g., attached to an edge port – 
can be checked and “authorized” periodically or on -demand according 
to management policies. This technique can be used to identify switch 
ports in case of an optical bypass of the switches, e.g., aggregate switch 
identification by the core switch in colocation data center  scenarios. It is 
worth mentioning that the identification strategies could be different for 
different systems and networks [4 5] depending on distance and the 
devices in the system (e.g., router ). 
Finally, a relevant issue related to amplifiers is here discussed. 
Amplifiers typically include isolators that limit the propagation of the 
signal -stimulating RBP. Thus, because of isolat ors, it is not possible to 
measure the fingerprint of a concatenation of fiber spans. Such an issue 
mainly impacts applications to backbone or metro networks, where 
amplifiers are typically employed. This may prevent an operator to limit 
the number of moni toring points for authentication. Indeed, if 
estimating the fingerprint of a concatenation of fibers from the 
knowledge of each fiber fingerprint would be possible, this could be 
checked against its measurement on the field identifying an intrusion in 
a po int in between, without checking span by span. Differently, in a 
short -reach scenario, such as intra -data center  or PONs where 
amplifiers are typically not needed, estimating the fingerprint of a 
concatenation of fibers can be very useful. Thus, this can p ave the way 
for the study of models estimating the fingerprint of concatenated fibers. 
At the moment only preliminary works have been done on fingerprint 
concatenation  [45,46] and more detailed studies are needed.  
Another relevant challenge can be the aut omation of authentication 
and identification procedures relying on OPUF with the proposal of 
properly designed protocols, initiating the authentication procedure, 
disseminating measured fingerprints, correlating such measurements, 
and sending possible alar ms when detecting intrusions.  
B. User authentication  in quantum system  
 
Since the term PUF was coined by Pappu et al. in 2001 [ 35], these 
objects gained a lot of interest and started to be used for a wide series of 
different security purposes such as ident ification and authentication, 
with applications in tamper evidence, anti -counterfeiting, etc . They have 
recently been adopted to face the authentication problem in quantum 
key distribution systems [ 47]). 
A generic QKD protocol is able to offer information -theoretic security  
(ITS) and its aim is to allow two users to establish a common secret key 
despite the presence of powerful adversaries . In order to  succeed in this, 
two users employ a quantum channel that is thought to be open to 
possible tampering by an eavesdropper and a classical one which, 
instead, needs to be authenticated. Under these assumptions, an 
attacker can manipulate the raw key created via the exchange of the 
quantum states and only listen to the conversation over the classical 
channel. Here, with respect to classical protocols (symmetric and 
asymmetric classic cryptographic schemes), the laws of quantum 
mechanics provide the possibility  to estimate a possible eavesdropper’s 
intervention and the potential amount of information in her hands, so 
that the protocol can be eventually stopped [ 48]. This evaluation 
happens during the post -processing stage, performed along the classical 
channel: in this scenario, it appears of absolute importance a proper 
authentication of the classical channel, as each of the two legitimate 
parties of the conversation needs to rely on the other’s party true 
identity so  to prevent a possible man-in-the-middle atta ck. In fact, a 
malevolent party, say Eve, can connect her QKD devices to the loose 
ends of the channels in order to hide her presence (Figure  6) so that she 
pretends to be Bob to Alice and Alice to Bob, modifying any message 
sent from Alice to Bob or vice versa.  
The tool for this authentication job is the so -called message 
authentication code (MAC), for whose realization the Wegman -Carter 
authentication scheme and variations thereof are the most 
implemented methods to provide ITS [49]. Anyway, this kind of 
authentication requires a pre -shared key, which is usually considered 
the main drawback of QKD protocols; moreover, the need for a pre -
shared secret key complicates considerably the design of large full -mesh 
QKD networks, as the number of keys has a quadra tic grown with the 
number of users participating. In the past, different efforts were made 
to decrease the length of the pre -shared key in existing QKD protocols 
and to make easier their distribution and management [ 50]. 
A possible solution to this problem  is the integration of the PUFs at the 
endpoints of the classical channel of a QKD apparatus, using their 
response as the tag generation required for the classical channel 
authentication. This tag is characterized by internal random disorder 
because the re sponse to a given challenge reflects the internal disorder 
of the device: in this way, the response of a PUF can play the role of a 
fingerprint [ 51,52]. 
 
Fig.6. Schematic representation  of the proposed authentication 
protocol: Alice can recognize whom she  is talking with thanks to the 
Rayleigh backscattered  light  from the other's party pigtail, as this 
provides a unique and unclonable  fingerprint of her interlocutor.  
Due to the unpredictable feature of PUFs, their use adds another layer 
of security in a QKD apparatus. The existing PUFs collections are so 
extensive that every class of them is characterized by features that can 
be useful concerning some applications. While Nikolopoulos [ 52] has 
considered the PUF tag, which is fabricated and attached to each QKD 
box (sender or receiver), we introduce here an OPUF, which is already 
present in the QKD box without manufacturing requirements and is an 
inherent feature of the QKD box, that eliminates such PUF tag 
disadvantages as tag scratching or stealing, or copying by adversaries, 
who have access to the PUF tag. Considering that each QKD box includes 
the optical fiber (fiber optic transceiver pigtails), each QKD box can be 
uniquely identified by its ID generated by our proposed OPUF -based 
identification model, which is the RBP of its fiber optic pigtails.  In this 
way, each QKD box carries the tag inside itself, i.e., its ID, which is hidden 
from the rivals, and just only the  one that can measure it can observe the 
ID, whereas the external tag ID can be observed and copied by the 
adversaries. In summary, our proposed model is based on strong OPUF and seems a promising candidate for the authentication problem in the 
QKD system,  which is also compatible with QKD infrastructures.  
 
5. PRACTICA L OI APPLICATIONS IN OPTICAL 
COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS  
 
In optical communication systems or networks , OI can be 
implemented through  the measure ment  of the RBP of the device pigtail 
or of the fiber link. Below we describe some implementation examples.  
A. Sub-system identification  
 
Let us consider an optical sub -system having its own fiber pigtail 
whose length is generally in the order of 50 -100 cm, which we use for 
RBP measure.  
We consider a simulation scenario with  a 0.5m fiber pigtail , and we 
measure the RBP with the C -OFDR with a sweep time  of 0.5s. The analog 
signal is digitized using a single -bit analog to digital converter  (ADC) 
with 𝑁=4000  samples . 
For the sake of compari son with [2 8], 96 additional bits are added, and 
the signature is converted into a two -dimensional (2D) 64×64 matrix, 
graphically represented as a QR code in Figure 7, with 𝑛=64 (the 
length of each row). Note that an additional level of security can be 
added in the 96 bits, in the form of a shared key.  
Firstly, we investigate the robustness of the signature against brute 
force trials (BFT) by evaluating its inner -Hamming distance . Comparing 
all possible combinations of the 64 rows (which provides 2016 =(64
2)  
pairs), we obtain 2016 HD values , ranging from 0 to 𝑛=64. If the inner 
HD is too small or too large, it means that the rows are correlated,  and 
one can be easily obtained from the other one. Conversely, it is desirable 
to have inner HD in average close to  𝑛/2=32. In our case, the 
histogram of the inner HD, shown in Fig ure 7(c), has a mean value of 
31.9, very close to the optimal value.  
Next, to assess  the reproducibility and uniqueness of the signature , we 
consider the intra -Hamming and inter -Hamming distances, 
respectively. We generated 100 different signatures of the same sub -
system, adding some  random white Gaussian noise  (in a practical  
system,  repeated measurements are subject to noise) . It is desirable that 
the HD of these signatures, the intra  HD, is small, which indicates that 
the signature match is more probable. We also generated 100 different 
signatures representing 100 subsystems . Conversely, it is desirable that 
the HD among the signatures of different subsystems, the inter  HD, is 
close to 𝑛2/2, to ensure that it is difficult to match by mistake. Figu re 8 
(a) and (b) show the intra and inter -HD obtained by our simulations. 
The f irst has a mean  value of 144.06, while the second a mean value of 
1994.08, both showing excellent values.

shows ID reproducibility . (b) Inter -Hamming distance of 100 different 
IDs stored in the CRP database and one ID, which was not stored in the 
library , shows ID uniqueness . 
We show in Fi gure 9  how the probability of false negative and false 
positive changes when the threshold change s.  When 𝛾, as defined in 
equation (2), approaches zero (one, respectively), the probability of 
false negative and false positive becomes 0.5 (minimum, respectively ), 
while the probability of false positive becomes minimum (0.5, 
respectively).  For 𝛾=0.5 and SNR =0 dB, the probability of false 
identification is in the order of 10-60.

differen t SNR values . 
B. Path identification in optical networks  
 
Let us consider the application of OI to an optical network. First, we 
take into account the simple case of two sub -systems (e.g., two optical 
fiber spans), then we extend our method to a large numb er of sub -
systems in the network . Finally, two examples are considered for 
specific network topologies: point -to-point in the access segment, and 
point -to-point in the metro/core infrastructure.  
B.1 Two sub -systems identification  
 
C-OFDR allows to measure RBPs provided by a single fiber/pigtail or a 
fiber concatenation. In optical networks, different fiber spans as well as 
passive sub -systems are plugged through fiber connectors which cause 
reflections due to the fiber -air interface s. Such reflections appear as high 
back -reflected intensity peaks at each specific distance thus giving 
information about the link composition within the network. A typical 
reflectivity as a function of the distance including Rayleigh 
backscattering (RB) a nd connectors is shown in Figure 10. In the figure, 
an arbitrary fiber segment is identified for each fiber span through red 
and blue points respectively.  
Network path identification is based on the measure and identification 
of the two concatenated fiber  span signatures provided by segments 
RBPs. The procedure is detailed hereafter.  
 
Fig.10  Backscattering typical reflection profile measured across three 
fiber connectors (peaks) and two fiber spans. Red and blue dots are 
chosen for fiber identification.  
First, the RBPs associated to each fiber are measured  through C -OFDR , 
using the same challenge as is used in section 5. A, and acquired with a 
high -resolution ADC (6  bit). Next, a scanning window is applied to the 
RBP of each fiber to select a specific fib er subsection long enough to 
uniquely identify the fiber. We here take 26  cm for each fiber at the 
arbitrary distance shown in Figure  10 as red and blue points  
respectively. RBPs amplitudes are normalized to their maximum values. 
Figure 11  (top) shows the measured RBPs for the two fibers at the red 
(left) and blue (right) positions as described in Figure 10. For each RBP 
a reduced set of data 𝑆1,𝑆2 is selected for each fiber (red and blue color 
in the pictures respectively ). 𝑆1and 𝑆2 are independently interpolated 
and overlapped to calculate the intersection points as shown in Figure 
11 (bottom). Finally, the intersection points are quantized to two levels 
to obtain a digital signature, represented as a QR code as in section A.  
The s ignature represents the specific ID of the considered network path 
and is used for path identification through HD with reference IDs. If an 
additional shared key is added to the signature, this should also be 
stored in the database.   
The protocol is detail ed as follows:  
Protocol 1 : Two sub -systems identification protocol  
1. Measure the RBP of the two sub -systems  
2. Select RBP for the two sections → S1 and S2  
3. Find S1 and S2 intersection points  
4. Two levels quantization → ID generation  
5. HD evaluation with reference ID → identification  
 
For the performance evaluation of the proposed method, 200 
independent network IDs (QR) are generated and stored into the 
database together with the related keys. Thus, the challenge  is the 
sweeping parame ters to measure the RBP , and the response  is the 
binary image  obtained from the RBP of the selected part of the fibers in 
the networks.  Additionally, 25 fake IDs are randomly generated for 
testing purposes. After HD evaluation , none of the fake 25 IDs are 
identified as belonging to the database, and only genuine 200 IDs give 
positive responses  each having a single match.  
 
Fig. 11.  Top: Selected backscattered data for the two fibers (left and 
right); bottom: (left) data superi mposition, (right) intersection points , 
and binary image (QR) as network ID .  
 B.2 Cascaded sub -systems  identification  
 
ID generation is here described for a system including three devices 
(fibers) but can be extended to any number of sub -systems.  We descr ibe 
here two possible approaches.  
 
The first approach simply extends what has been described in section 
B.1 for the two sub -systems by intersecting the measure of the third 
sub-system  𝑆3 with the intersections of the previous two.   The binary 
ID is finally distilled by two -level quantization and is used for 
identification through HD measure with reference IDs.  
Alternatively, the three -fiber ID may be obtained by cascading two 
independen t intersection points of sub -systems measure (e.g., 1, 2 and 
1, 3). The resulting ID is obtained as a subset of the concatenation of 
intersection points after two -level quantization.  Identification is 
obtained by HD evaluation with reference IDs. The proto cols for both 
approaches are listed hereafter  (Protocol 2,3) . 
 
Protocol 2: Cascaded sub -systems identification protocol (I)  
1. Measure the RBP of the cascaded sub -systems  
2. Select RBP for three sections → S1, S2, S3  
3. Find S1 and S2 intersection points → J1 
4. Find J1 and S3 intersection points → J2 
5. J2 two levels quantization → ID generation  
6. HD evaluation with reference ID → identification  
 
 
Protocol 3: Cascaded sub -systems identification protocol (II)  
1. Measure the RBP of the cascaded sub -systems  
2. Select RBP for three sections → S1, S2, S3  
3. Find S1 and S2 intersection points → J1 
4. Find S1 and S3 intersection points → J2 
5. Take a subset ( J1,J2) → J3 
6. J3 two levels quantization → ID generation  
7. HD evaluation with reference ID → identification  
 
B.3 Point -to-point  identification in the access segment  
 
In an optical network, if the transmitter (Tx) and/or receiver (Rx) are 
able to perform RBP measurement, th e identification will be 
implemented through direct measurement and HD evaluation . In an 
access network architecture as shown in Figure 1 2, the central node 
(CN) communicates point -to-point (P2P) with any connected user. The 
proposed technique allows to ha ve mutual identification between CN 
and users if both have access to the database where ID are stored. In 
Figure 1 2  an identification example is shown. The CN sends challenge 
𝐶1 through the fiber link to the user with  ID1 and collects back response 
𝑅1represented by the RBP in black in the figure. A subset of the data is 
extracted (blue curve) , sampled  (red curve) and digitized to obtain the 
ID (QR). The CN, in this case, searches for ID into the database, and, if it 
finds a match , it confirms user identification. A  symmetric procedure is 
adopted by the user for CN identification.  
 
Fig. 1 2. User ID1 identification procedure by central node (CN) in a P2P 
architecture.  
B.4 Point -to-point identification example in a metro/c ore 
infrastructure  
 
In metro and core optical networks, where paths may overcome 50km 
length, RBP measures can be very noisy or not feasible due to fiber 
attenuation. We propose here a central node (CN) -assisted 
identification strategy for long distances e xploiting RBP detailed in 
Figure 1 3. Two ID databases 𝐷1,𝐷2 include the same set of challenges 
and responses and a specific key  𝑘1,𝑘2. The CN communicates to the 
user a specific challenge 𝐶1 that the user must send for link identification 
measure in t he proximity of his site (fiber pigtail of last mile fiber). The 
response 𝑅1is collected by the user as the RBP and ID is obtained though 
concatenation with one of the two keys arbitrarily (e.g., 𝑘1). The ID is 
sent to the CN who search es for a match into both 𝐷1 and 𝐷2. If the CN 
finds the ID into one of the two databases, it asks the user which of the 
two keys he did use. If the key corresponds to the database where the 
match was found, the ID is confirmed. In this way, the access to t he link 
by an adversary that may read the RBP, is not enough for the 
identification process that is protected by the knowledge of the used 
key. The identification protocol is provided below  (protocol 4).  
 
In contrast to the traditional PUF challenge -response database , in 
which any single challenge ends with a response, in the proposed 
method, each challenge can be used for several fibers. That is, one 
challenge could be used for several fibers providing dif ferent responses. 
This method also reduces the OPUF challenge -response database size.   
 
Protocol 4: Point -to-point identification protocol in a metro/core  
infrastructure  
1. CN sends the challenge  C1 to the user  
2. The user measures response R1  
3. R1 two levels quantization  
4. Arbitrary key concatenation → ID generation  
5. The user sends ID to the CN  
6. CN searches for ID matches in the two databases D 1 and D2 
a. Match is found   
i.CN asks the user for the key  
ii.CN verifies the key -database correspondence → 
identification  
b. Match is not found → identification failed

infrastructure .  
6. CONCLUSION  
 
In this work, we have proposed for the first time the concept of optical 
identification (OI) for network security purposes at the physical layer. In 
particular, we propose to use the fingerprint of each network’s sub -
system to identify, authenticate, and m onitor an optical network. We 
introduce the concept of OI and we describe a technique to assess the 
identification reliability. Next, we propose to use the physical unclonable 
functions (PUFs) for OI, to exploit the intrinsic unclonability and 
uniqueness o f PUFs. In particular, we propose to use the  Rayleigh 
backscattering, an optical PUF, to identify a fiber. In this way, each sub -
system of a network can be identified just using its pigtail (or the fiber 
itself for a link), without any additional device, a nd working directly at 
the physical layer. To highlight the huge possibilities of this technique 
and its potential impact in the field, we described two possible 
applications of OI: physical layer security in classical communications 
and user authenticatio n in QKD. On the one hand, we highlighted how 
OI at the physical layer can significantly enhance the security of a n 
optical  network  through the identification of sub -systems and links . On 
the other hand, we described how OI can be effectively used for the 
authentication of the users (Alice and Bob) in a QKD system. Indeed, the 
authentication of the users (sometimes referred to as authentication of 
the classical channel) before QKD transmission is essential to ensure the 
reliability of the whole process and is usually done with conventional 
cryptographic methods (e.g., the MAC).  
We described, as practical OI applications in optical communication 
systems and networks, how OI can be implemented for the 
identification of a fiber or a fiber pigtail in a point -to-point scenario and 
for the identification of a path in an optical network with passive 
components.  
The OI concept represents an innovative approach to physical layer 
security which can be applied to any optical communication system  and 
network. OI is based  on existing intrinsic characteristics of physical sub -
systems and it provides additional features to optical systems and 
networks operation.
