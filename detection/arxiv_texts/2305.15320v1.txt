1  Abstract  
 
The research was conducted to identify the factors that influence college students' satisfaction with  
their college  experience.  Firstly,  the study  was focused  on the literature  review  to determine  
relevant  factors  that have  been  previously  studied  in the literature.  Then,  the survey  analysis  
examined three main independent factors that have been found to be related to college students'  
satisfaction: Major Satisfaction, Social Self -Efficacy, and Academic Performance. The findings of  
the study suggested that the most important factor affecting students' satisfaction with their college  
experience is their satisfaction with their chosen major. This means that students who are satisfied  
with the major  they have  chosen  are more  likely  to be overall  satisfied  with their college  
experience. It's worth noting that, while the study found that major satisfaction is the most crucial  
factor, it doesn't mean that other factors such as Social Self -Efficacy, Academic Performance, and  
Campus Life Satisfaction are not imp ortant. Based on these findings, it is recommend that students  
prioritize their major satisfaction when making college choices in order to maximize their overall  
satisfaction with their college experience.  2  TABLE  OF CONTENT

1-) Introduction  
 
The study aims to explore whether and how major satisfaction, social self -efficacy, and  
academic performance are associated with METU students’ satisfaction with campus life. Besides  
using  major  satisfaction,  social  self-efficacy,  and academic  performance  as quantitative  and 
qualitative indicators, the residential place of the students is used as a categorical variable as well,  
since the location of the METU campus might be considered as a “non -city-center” location. In  
addition, the literature indicates that n ot only there might be a relationship between these factors to  
the campus life satisfaction of students, but also there is a significant relationship between the  
factors as well. Therefore, prior research and investigations are strongly supporting the idea  that 
there  is a correlation  between  the dependent  variable  and affecting  factors  as much  as the 
correlation between the factors. In light of this potential, the research seeks to give a solution and  
provide suggestions to those METU students who are dissatisfied and meet difficulties to achieve  
their goals and dreams during their college years. The f ollowing diagram illustrates the connection  
between the identified factors and campus life satisfaction.

1.1-) Aim of  the research  
 
This research aims to identify the key factors that influence student satisfaction with their  
experience on a college campus. These factors can include major satisfaction, social self -efficacy,  
and academic  performance.  The goal is to use statistical  model s to better  understand  the 
relationships between these factors and student satisfaction, and to use this information to guide  
future research studies. This research will help in understanding the factors that promote student  
satisfaction and can help the c ollege administration to improve the student's life on campus.  4  1.2-) Research  Questions  
 
In this research, there are three factors that affect students’s campus life satisfaction - major  
satisfaction,  self efficacy,  academic  performance.  Research  questions  were  illustrated  in the 
following table.

1.3-) Survey  Description  
 
The survey of college life satisfaction among METU students was conducted, consisting of  
57 questions covering various aspects of their university experience such as satisfaction with their  
major, academic performance, and social self -efficacy. The survey utilized a variety of question  
formats including Likert scales, drop -down options, open -ended questions, and matrix questions. It  
aimed to gather both quantitative and qualitative data to gain an understanding of the students'  
overall satisfaction with the ir college experience. 249 students participated in the survey, which was  
administered through a combination of online and in -person methods, with a response rate of 80%.  5  2-) Review  of Literature  
 
2.1-) Literature  Review  on Major  Satisfaction  
 
The studies on how to feel well or at least better are best conceptualized under the name  
“subjective  well-being”  (Diener,  1999).  Diener  defines  subjective  well-being  as “people’s  
evaluations of their lives —evaluations that are both affective  and cognitive” (Diener, 2000). Pesch  
et al. (2018)  indicated  in the research new concept is defined as ‘‘enjoyment of one’s role or  
experiences  as a student’’  (Lent  et al., 2007)  to evaluate  college  students’  satisfaction.  Among  all 
the forms  of academic  satisfaction,  major  satisfaction  has received  the most  attention  in the 
experimental literature.”. Students’ satisfaction with their academic major may predict academic  
performance,  social self -efficacy, and  overall life satisfaction.  
 
Kim Hee-Yung (2009)  and Pesch  et al. (2018)  also made  research  regarding  major  
Satisfaction. They focused on how to scale major satisfaction and which factors have an effect on it.  
However, in this research, the focus is to advance the progress that has been made and measure  
major  satisfaction  by using  these  findings  and analyzing  its psychometric  properties  to check  
whether  there  is an association  between  major  satisfaction  and the campus life satisfaction of  
METU students.  
 
2.2-) Literature  Review  on Social  Self-Efficacy  
 
Self-efficacy  has been  defined  as a person's  belief  in successfully  performing  a task 
(Bandura, 1997). Having this competence in the social domain allows a person to be effective in  
social interactions and to establish positive interpersonal relationships. For a college student, failing  
in the campus social li fe may negatively affect the student academically, socially, and mentally,  
which  in turn may reduce her/him overall satisfaction at the university. For instance, ineffective  
peer group  social  connections  may lead to loneliness in college students, which ma y result in  
depression,  low self-esteem,  and poor academic  performance  (Blai,  1989).  Moreover,  these  negative  
social behaviors may seriously damage the career path of students.  
In order to measure the association of self -efficacy with social behavior, rese arch conducted  
by Smith and Betz (2000) studied 354 undergraduate students participating in a psychology course  
at Ohio State University. Smith and Betz found high consistency in a development sample of 354  
undergraduate  students  with respect  to the Scale  of Perceived  Social  Efficacy  (PSSE)  which  
measures  the level  of confidence  in a variety  of social  situations.  They discovered  a robust  6  relationship between social efficacy and the career development phase in college students (Smith  
and Betz, 2000).  
In light of this finding, in this survey study, we will attempt to find out if self -efficiency and  
campus  life satisfaction  of METU  students  are associated,  as well as how the social  aspects  
correspond to academic performance and major satisfaction.  
 
2.3-) Literature Review on  Academic  Performance  
 
Intuitively,  a strong  academic  background  and skill set are important  to college  achievement.  
However, it is normally believed that a host of other  students’ personal and institutional attributes  
impact student attitudes or their satisfaction with the college experience. Ajzen and Fishbein (1980)  
theorized that an individual’s intentions, and thus their behavior, may be predicted by attitudes.  
From t his basis, other researchers have offered that student satisfaction supports their intention to  
stay in college,  which supports  student  retention (Martirosyan,  Saxon,  & Wanjohi,  2014).  
 
Kamemera et. al (2003) reported that student satisfaction with the learning environment and  
student services was correlated with their performance. Palak and Walls (2009) found a positive  
relationship between satisfaction and achievement. Dryden, Webster, and Fraser (2010) maintained  
that achievement was not related to satisfaction with learning except for students with the highest  
satisfaction ratings. Learning was most effective with high satisfaction, high cohesion, and low  
friction.  The literature  revie w showed  a mixed relationship between satisfaction and academic  
achievement. Taking this into account, our study shifts to examining the role of students' academic  
performance on campus life satisfaction and investigates the relationship between the satisf action of  
METU students and academic performance.  
 
2.4-) Literature  Review  on Major  Satisfaction,  Social  Self-Efficacy,  Academic  
Performance  & Campus  Life Satisfaction  
It would not be wrong to assume that there is an intuitive connection between university  
students' self -efficacy and major satisfaction of the university students. Komarajju, Swanson, and  
Nadler (2014) conducted research with 226 students to verify this hy pothesis. As a result of the  
regression analysis, they observed that the increase in the self -efficacy of the university students  
boosted  their course  satisfaction  with their major  satisfaction (Komarraju, Nadler & Swanson,  
2014).  Likewise,  we anticipate  that the results  of our study  will demonstrate  a link between  self-
efficacy  and major satisfaction for METU students.  7  It is not difficult  to assume  that a satisfied  and social  student  will also be successful  
academically. In order to prove that idea empirically, in the article Life Satisfaction and Student  
Performance , overall  life satisfaction was considered as a dependent variable and the students'  
GPAs were examined in relation to their cumulative GPAs and life domains (Rode et al., 2005).  
Similarly, in our project, we are planning to examine the relationship between students' GPAs and  
their academic achievements by considering campus life satisfaction as a dependent variable.  
 
3-) Methodology/Analysis  
It wa s conducted a survey to students using an online platform called Jotform in order to  
gather  information  for our analysis.  Then  we it organized and prepared the collected data for  
analysis. We utilized the ggplot2 package in R -Studio to create visual repres entations of the data.  
We determined  whether  the variables  in question were parametric or non -parametric using the  
Shapiro  Wilk  test. Based  on the results,  we either  employed  a linear  regression  model or an  
appropriate non -parametric test for further analysis.  
Some of the major satisfaction questions were divided into three subgroups satisfaction with  
training, satisfaction with the facilities, and satisfaction with the program schedules. Responses are  
obtain ed using a five -point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not very well, strongly disagree) to 5 (very  
well, strongly agree). After that, subgroup responses were averaged for each person. Then, the  
descriptive  statistics  were  examined. A bar graph was created to examine the means of subgroups  
by faculties.  Shapiro  Wilk  normality  test was applied  to determine  whether  the satisfactions  of 
males  and females  were  normally  distributed.  In addition,  the shape  of the distribution  was 
measured by calculating the kurtosis and skewness coefficients. The z -test was used to determine  
whether  there  is a significant  difference  between  the overall  major  satisfaction  means  of females  
and males. The reason for this is the population variance was  unknown, however, the sample size  
was over 30. The bar plot was established to show the trend of increasing/decreasing students’  
confidence  in readiness  for the world  of work  through  their academic  classes.  Shapiro  Wilk  
normality test and QQ -plot were applied to determine whether major satisfaction was normally  
distributed  or not. Regression  analysis  was used to examine  the causal  relationships  between  
academic  performance,  campus  life satisfaction  (predictor  variables),  and major  satisfaction  
(response variable). A correlation chart was generated to examine the relationship between all the  
variables.  
This survey  involved  the Perceived  Social  Self-Efficacy  (PSSE)  by Smith  & Betz (2000).  
the measure  consists  of 25 logically  formulated  items  that evaluate  the degree  of confidence  in a 8  
series  of social  conditions.  19 of these  items  were  relatively  selected  and separated  into 4 
subfactors:  Networking  (1-5) - Expressing ideas (6 -9) - Teamwork(10 -11) Self -Confidence and  
Assertiveness (12 -19). The responses are collected using a five -point Likert scale ranging from 1  
(not very well) to 5 (very well). In this study, Cronbach's alpha was used to determine the int ernal  
consistency reliability of the scale. The bar graphs were generated to demonstrate the distribution of  
social self -efficacy between two factors: Faculty and Residence. The post -Stratification sampling  
method by gender is applied to minimize the sampl ing error and potential non -response bias. The  t-
test was established  to decide  whether  there  is a significant  association between  the students  with a 
higher social self -efficacy value with producing better academic  performance.  
In the academic performance  part of METU Students’s Campus Life Satisfaction Survey , the 
academic performance of students was evaluated based on the 6 different sub -factors. According to  
the average of 14 different likert questions of these factors, a scaled academic performance val ue 
was created  for each student. In the following graph, the students’s campus life satisfaction and  
their GPA  relation  were illustrated  based on  the conducted  research question.  
4-) Results  and Findings  
 
4.1-) Descriptive  Statistics  
 
Figure  2: Academic  class  distribution  
 
In Figure 2, their overall satisfaction scores out of five are shown. Freshman, Sophomore,  
and Senior counts are almost the same. The number of Junior students is the most. The numbers  
indicated  on the graphs show the average of the satisfaction the students get from the campus out of  
5. While the satisfaction received from the campus is high in prep (3.48) and junior students (3.52),  
these values decrease for the Senior (3,32) and Sophomore (3.34) stude nts. 9  
 
 
Table  2: Satisfaction  values  of the factors  
In Table 2, the satisfaction values of the four factors are between 2.92 and 3.43 out of 5. The  
minimum  value  is Social  Self Efficacy,  and the  maximum  value  is Campus  Life Satisfaction.

4.2-) Major  Satisfaction  
 
4.2.1 -) Subgroups  of Major  Satisfaction  
 
The subgroups  seen in Table  4 are ranked according to their mean values. It has been  
observed that the median value of satisfaction of training is higher than the other subgroups, and the  
most repeated value is four. When these descriptive statistics were examined, it was concl uded that  
METU students were more satisfied with the training.  
10   
 
 
Table  4: Descriptive  Statistics  for the Major  Satisfaction  Subgroups  (n=249)  
 
The means of these subgroups were investigated according to faculties. When Figure 4 is  
examined, it was determined that satisfaction of training was generally higher than others, and  
satisfaction  of program  schedules  was less, and the results  were  consist ent with descriptive  
statistics. It is observed that satisfactions in faculties are generally evenly distributed. However,  
when the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences is examined, it is seen that the training  
is quite  high compared  to the others. On the other  hand,  program  schedules  satisfaction  in the 
faculty of foreign languages is lower than the others. When Figure 4 is examined in general, it has  
been determined that the satisfaction values are mostly above three, which means neutral, and it has  
been concluded that METU students are satisfied with th ese subgroups.  
 
 
Figure  4: Distributions  of Major  Subgroups  by Faculties  
11  4.2.2 -) Overall  Major  Satisfactions  of Female  and Male  
 
Due to the small number of participants who chose prefer not to say and others, only the  
overall major satisfactions of female and male were examined. First, it was tested whether the  
distributions were normally distributed. According to the Shapiro Wilk n ormality test results in  
Figure 5, the null hypothesis could not be rejected because the p values for both genders were  
greater  than significance  level  (p = 0.1203  > 0.05 for female,  p = 0.1484  > 0.05 for male).  
Therefore, it has been determined that the major satisfactions of female and male are normally  
distributed.  
 
 
 
 
Figure  5: Normal  Q-Q Plot of Overall  Major  Satisfactions  of Female  and Male  
 
Since kurtosis values are greater than three for both gender (see Figure 6,7) , they have  
leptokurtic  distribution.  It means  that they tend to produce  more  outliers  than the normal  
distribution. The skewness coefficient for female is 0.36 (see Figure 6). B ecause it is bigger than  
zero, distribution of major satisfaction of female appears to be positively skewed, and more of the  
values are concentrated on the left side. On the other hand, because coefficient of skewness of male  
(-0.30)  is less than zero,  distribution  is negatively  skewed,  that is, more  of the values  are 
concentrated on the right side of the distribution (see Figure 7).  
12    
 
Figure  6: Major  Satisfaction  of Female  Histogram  Figure  7: Major  Satisfaction  of Male  Histogram  
 
It was examined  whether  there  was a significant  difference  between  the overall major  
satisfaction means of female and male. To answer this, a hypothesis has been established. Since p  
value in Table 5 is bigger than significance level (0.268 > 0.05), null hyphothesis could not be  
rejected.  This means that there is no significant difference between the mean of major satisfaction  
of female and mean of major satisfaction of male.  
 
 
Table  5: R Output  of Z-Test 
 
4.2.3 -) Feeling  Ready  for The World  of Work  
 
By looking at figure 8, it can be examined that there is a significant percentage of students  
are unsure about their readiness for the world of work in earlier years of their education. Ho wever,  
as students progress through their academic classes, they become more confident in their readiness.  
This is indicated by a consistent decrease in the percentage of "unsure" responses and a consistent  
increase in the percentage of "yes" responses fro m the preparation school to the junior year where  
for the first time, the answer of "yes" is in the majority with 43.96 percent.  In the senior year, a  
decrease is observed in the percentage of "yes" responses, and the answers to "yes" and "unsure" are  
equalized at 39.13 percent. In the master's year, there are no "unsure" responses. In the PhD year,  
again the answer of unsure is in the majority with 50 percent.

4.2.4 -) Regression Analysis between Academic Performance, Campus Life Satisfaction  
and Major  Satisfaction  
In this part, regression analysis was conducted between academic performance, campus life  
satisfaction (predictor variables), and major satisfaction ( response variable). It is important to check  
whether  the response  variable  (major  satisfaction)  is normally  distributed  before conducting a  
regression analysis.  
 
 
 
Figure  9: A Q-Q plot for Normality  
14  The Shapiro -Wilk test is another way to check for normality. By looking at table 6, it can be  
examined that since the p -value of major satisfaction is greater than 0.05 (significance level) which  
is 0.08, the major satisfaciton is normally distributed. So,  there is no need to do any transformation  
before conducting the model.  
 
By looking  at table  7, it can be examined  that the adj-R square  value of the model which is  
0.46 indicates  that these  two predictor  variables  explain  about  46% of the variation in Major  
Satisfaction.  The F-statistic  has a p-value  (< 2.2e-16) less than the significance  level  (0.05),  
indicating  that at least one of the independent  variables  in the model  is significantly  related  to 
Major Satisfaction. Academic Performance and Campus Life Satisfaction p -values are (3.66e -10) 
and (<2e -16) respectively. Since The p -values for both predictor variables are less than 0.05, they  
are statistically significant.  
 
Major Satisfaction =0.84+0.28 (Academic Performance)+0.44 (Campus Life Satisfaction)  
 
In regression equation: The intercept 0.8447 (β0) represents the predicted value of the major  
satisfaction when all predictor variables academic performance and campus life satisfaction are  
equal to z ero. 
𝛽1 = 0.28,  indicates  that while  all other  variables  are zero,  a one-unit increase  in academic  
performance will lead to an increase of 0.28 units in Major Satisfaction.  
 
𝛽2 = 0.44,  indicates  that while  all other  variables  are zero,  a one-unit increase  in Campus  Life 
Satisfaction will lead to an increase of 0.44 units in Major Satisfaction.

15  4.2.5 -) Correlation Analysis between Academic Performance, Campus Life Satisfaction  
and Major  Satisfaction  
The correlation coefficients in the chart provide a summary of the relationship between the  
variables and can help to identify any patterns or associ ations between the variables. By looking at  
figure  10 , it can be examined that the correlation between major satisfaction and campus life  
satisfaction  (0.62)  is positive which  indicates that as campus life satisfaction increases, major  
satisfaction is lik ely to increase as well. The correlation is considered "strong" since a value of  
correlation coefficient in the interval of 0.6 to 0.799, which implies a large association between the  
two variables.

16  
Internal consistency reliability coefficient of 0.94 was reported by Smith and Betz (2000).  
Cronbach’s alpha was obtained to establish the consistency of the scale. The internal consistency  
reliability  estimate  for the  scale  was (α  = 0.78) which  indicates it  had acceptable consistency.  
 
4.3.2 -) Social  Self-efficacy  Distribution  Among  Faculty  and Residenc e 
 
Figure  11: Social  Self-Efficacy  Distribution  Among  Faculty  
 
Figure  12: Social  Self-Efficacy  Distribution  Among  Residence  
 
 
Social Self -efficacy Distribution was examined among residents and faculties to investigate  
their associations. As it is represented in Figure 11 Arts and Science faculty has the highest and the  
Foreign Languages faculty has the lowest social self -efficacy  values in METU. However, it can be  
observed that there is no significant difference between the faculties. By looking at Figure 12 it is  
shown  that the mean  values  of in-campus and off -campus residents are extremely close to each  
other  by 3.5 and 3.35 respectively,  so it is conducted  that there  is no relationship  between  Social  
Self Efficacy and both residents and faculties.  17  4.3.3 -) Post-Stratification  on Social  Self-Efficacy  by Gender

Gender  Social self -efficacy value  SE 
Female  2.934634  0.05038247  
Male  2.906949  0.05206446  
 
Table  10: Post-Stratification  on Social  Self-Efficacy  by Gender  
 
 
With Post -Stratification on Social Self -Efficacy by Gender in our data, from Table 9 and  
Table 10, we can examine that the overall social self -efficacy of  Males and Females in METU is  
approximately equal to each other. Although, based on our data we can see that Females seem to  
have a slight (1.03%) more social self -efficacy effect. At the same time, the small standard error  
(~0.05), shows a very small variability in our data. Males hav e a higher variance, so their variability  
is bigger in METU. Both genders have a mean of lower than 3 so both groups seem not to have a  
well social self -efficacy. Even after calculating the 95% confidence interval, we can still observe  
that both upper and lower bounds are lower than 3.  And the total mean (2.91) is also lower than 3.  
 
4.3.4 -) Hypothesis  Test of Social  Self Efficacy  In Relation  to Academic  Performance  
 
 
Table  11: Output  of t-test 
18  
In investigating whether Students with higher Social Self Efficacy significantly produce  
better academic performance a hypothesis has been established. Since the P value in Figure 4 is less  
than the significance level (0.000156 < 0.05) we reject the null hypothesis. As a result, students  
with a 3.5 or higher Social Self Efficacy Value significantly produce better academic performance  
than students with  a 3.5  and lower  Social Self  Efficacy  Value.  
 
4.4-) Academic  Performance  
 
Figure  13: GPA  relationship  with campus  life satisfaction  
 
In this graph, in which students with a GPA of 3 and above are compared with the overall  
satisfaction  from  campus  life, the average  campus  life satisfaction  value  is 3.55 and the 
corresponding average GPA is 3.35. Moreover, It was investigated whether ther e is a difference  
between the campus satisfaction of university students whose average is above 3 and below 3.  
Welch T test was used to test the stated hypotheses because the variance values were different. The  
p value was found to be 0.00769 at the 95 per cent confidence interval. For this reason, it was  
observed that there was a significant difference between the campus satisfaction of the compared  
student  groups.  Test results  can be examined  in detail in  the following table.  
 
Table  12: T-test output  19  
4.4.1 -) Student  Attendance  in Classes  and Recitations  
In the following figure, class attendance and recitation attendendance are illustrated as a  
percentage.  
 
Figure  14: Class  attendance  and recitation  attendance  
 
As a minor research topic, the effect of class participation and recitation participation on  
GPA was desired to be observed in a descriptive manner. For this reason, the group with the highest  
class  and recitation  participation  was selected  and the distribution  of this group  was visualized  in 
the figure given below.

By looking  at Figure  15, it can be examined  that the R square  value  of the model  which  is 
0.28 indicates  the academic  performance  value  explain  about  28% of the variation  in campus  life 
20  
satisfaction  value.  The F-statistic  has a p-value  (< 1.27e -05) less than the significance  level  (0.05),  
indicating that academic performance value is significantly related to campus life satisfaction value.

4.5-) Campus  Life Satisfaction  
 
The graph of the last question, in which students were asked to estimate the most important  
factor  affecting campus life, is  given below.  
Figure 16: Students’  guess for the most important factor affecting campus life 
 
As seen i n the graph, the factor that the students thought to have the most impact on campus  
life was social self efficacy.  21   
 
Figure  17: Accuracy  of linear  regression  model  Figure  18: Accuracy  of random  forest  model  
 
Modeling  of student  satisfaction  with major  satisfaction,  social  efficacy  and academic  
performance is shown in the graphs above. According to the Linear Regression model, academic  
performance has 0.01 p values, social self efficacy has 0.002 p values, and major satisfaction has  
2e-16 p values. According to the random forest model, social sel f efficacy %IncMSE value was 7,  
academic performance %IncMSE value was 19 and major satisfaction %IncMSE value was 22.  
Although the order of influence of the factors affecting the campus life in which the two models are  
compared is different, it has been d etermined that major satisfaction is the most effective factor in  
both models.  
 
5-) Discussion/Conclusion  
 
Academic  performance,  social  self-efficacy  and major  satisfaction  are three  important  
factors that effect the students’s overall satisfaction. For ex ample, high academic performance can  
lead to a sense  of accomplishment  and pride,  which  can positively  impact  a student's  life 
satisfaction. Furthermore, good academic performance can open doors to various opportunities such  
as scholarships,  internships,  and employment  opportunities.  Beside  academic  performance  of 
students, social self -efficacy can lead such as a sense of belongin g, positive relationships with peers  
and faculty, and access to resources and support can all contribute to a student's satisfaction with  
their college  experience.  Additionally,  a positive  campus  environment,  including  the physical  
surroundings and overall  atmosphere, can also play a role in a student's satisfaction. However, most  
of all, the student's satisfaction with the department is most important factor that effects the overall  
satisfaction of students. Research has shown that students who are satisfi ed with their major tend to  
have better academic performance. Additionally, major satisfaction can also influence a student's  
decision  to pursue  a graduate  degree  or enter  a specific  field of work  after graduation.  For this 
22  reason,  the first thing  that students  should  pay attention  to when  choosing  a university  is major  
satisfaction.
