A new anchor-based optimization method of deﬁning the energ y density functionals (EDFs) is
proposed. In this approach, the optimization of the paramet ers of EDF is carried out for the se-
lected set of spherical anchor nuclei the physical observab les of which are modiﬁed by the correction
function which takes into account the global performance of EDF. It is shown that the use of this
approach leads to a substantial improvement in global descr iption of binding energies for several
classes of covariant EDFs. The computational cost of deﬁnin g a new functional within this ap-
proach is drastically lower as compared with the one for the o ptimization which includes the global
experimental data on spherical, transitional and deformed nuclei into the ﬁtting protocol.
Nuclear density functional theory (DFT) is presently
one of the most widely used self-consistent approaches
in low-energy nuclear physics [1–4]. It is based on the
concept of energy density functional (EDF) the several
parameters of which are deﬁned by the properties of ﬁ-
nite nuclei and nuclear matter properties. This approach
is universalin asense that it allowsthe globaldescription
of nuclear properties coveringthe nuclear landscape from
light to very heavy nuclei and from known to unknown
nuclei [5, 6]. It alsoprovidesimportant information, such
as masses, decay and ﬁssion rates etc, for nuclear astro-
physics [7, 8].
However,thedeﬁnitionofEDFsisnotuniqueandfaces
a number of challenges the part of which is related to ﬁt-
ting protocols [9, 10]. At present, absolute majority of
the EDFs are ﬁtted to the properties of spherical nuclei.
This led to a huge number of the functionals the global
performance of which is not established. There are more
than 300 relativistic (covariant) EDFs (further CEDFs)
(see, for example, Ref. [11]) and comparable number of
non-relativistic Skyrme EDFs. However, such an ap-
proachcreatesasubstantialbiastowardssphericalnuclei:
theimprovementofthe functionalforsphericalnucleifre-
quently leads to a degradation of its global performance.
Only very limited number of non-relativistic Skyrme and
Gogny EDFs and only one CEDF have been ﬁtted glob-
ally to experimental data which includes spherical, tran-
sitional and deformed nuclei (see Refs. [12–17]). How-
ever, the computational cost of the generation of such
functionals is enormous.
In the present paper a new method of anchor-based
optimization of the functionals is proposed in order to al-
leviate these problems. It combines the simplicity of the
optimization of EDFs to spherical nuclei with the infor-
mation ontheir globalperformance. In contrastto global
ﬁts of EDFs, it typically requires only several rounds of
global calculations to achieve a signiﬁcant improvement
of global performance of CEDFs. This was veriﬁed for
several classes of CEDFs and achieved at a moderate
increase of computational time as compared with the op-
timization to only spherical nuclei.
The general procedure for the anchor-based optimiza-
tion of EDFs is the following:1. The set of ”anchor” spherical nuclei is selected
and the optimization of the functional is carried
out with spherical relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov
(RHB) computer code using experimental data on
these nuclei and nuclear matter properties (NMP)
(see Refs. [6, 18] and Supplementary Material [19]
for details). The obtained functional is labelled as
EDFi(i= 0). Here iis the counter of the iteration
in the anchor-based optimization.
2. Global calculations of the masses, charge radii and
other physical observables are carried out with ax-
ially deformed RHB code using EDF ifor the set of
nuclei in which respective experimental data exist.
The set of binding energies EEDFi(Z,N) is deﬁned
for theneven-even nuclei the masses of which have
been eithermeasuredorestimated in the AME2016
mass evaluation [20]. Note that this set of the nu-
clei includes spherical, transitional and deformed
nuclei.
3. The correction function
Ecorr(Z,N) =αi(N−Z)+βi(N+Z)+γi(1)
is added1to the obtained set of calculated binding
energies
Epseudo(Z,N) =EEDFi(Z,N)+Ecorr(Z,N) (2)
Then, the optimal parameters αi,βiandγiare
determined by minimizing ∆ Ermsdeﬁned as:
∆Erms=/radicalbigg/summationtextn
k=1(Epseudo(Z,N)−Eexp(Z,N))2
n(3)
whereEexp(Z,N) is experimental binding energy
of thekth nucleus with ( Z,N) andkruns over all
even-even nuclei for which experimental data exist.
1Alternative functional dependencies have been explored. H ow-
ever, Eq. (1) brings the best improvement of the EDFs.2
Thus, the addition of Ecorr(Z,N) to binding ener-
gies aims at the minimization of global diﬀerence
between calculated and experimental binding ener-
gies. The variation of the parameters αi,βiandγi
with iteration number during the iterative proce-
dure are illustrated in Tables 1-3 of Supplemental
Material [19].
4. The energies of spherical anchor nuclei are rede-
ﬁned as
Epseudo
exp(Z,N) =Eexp(Z,N)+Ecorr(Z,N) (4)
whereEcorr(Z,N) is calculated for optimal pa-
rameters αi,βiandγideﬁned in previous step.
New set of parameters EDF i+1is deﬁned using
Epseudo
exp(Z,N) as ”experimental” data and the pro-
cedure of the point (1).
5. New global calculations are carried out using
EDFi+1and the procedure of point (2). A sig-
niﬁcant improvement in the global description of
masses has been achieved at the ﬁrst step of it-
erative procedure for the DD-MEY, NL5(Y) and
PC-Y functionals and at third step for the DD-
MEX1 one2. Further repetition of the steps (3)-(5)
leads to only moderate improvement of the global
description of the masses.
The convergence of iterative procedure is reached
in the limit αi→0,βi→0, andβi→0. However,
the analysis presented in Tables 1-3 of Supplemen-
tal Material [19] clearly suggests that the termina-
tionofiterativeprocedurebeforereachingthislimit
may lead to only very small (if any) degradation of
the global description of masses.
The spherical and deformed calculations are carried
out using the RHB computer codes developed in Refs.
[6, 18]. The truncation of the basis is performed in such
a way that all states belonging to the major shells up
toNF= 20 fermionic shells for the Dirac spinors and
up toNB= 20 bosonic shells for the meson ﬁelds are
taken into account. Note that the latter applies only to
the functionals which contain meson exchange such as
those belonging to non-linear meson couplings (NLME)
and density dependent meson-nucleon coupling (DDME)
classesofthe functionals (seeRefs. [6, 18]). The accuracy
ofthetruncationofthebasisisdiscussedinSupplemental
Material [19].
In order to avoid the uncertainties connected with the
deﬁnition of the size of the pairing window the separable
form of the ﬁnite range Gogny pairing interaction intro-
duced by Tian et al [24] is used with two versions of the
2Such feature of the anchor based optimization method can be e x-
tremely useful for theoretical groups with limited computa tional
resources.strength fof the pairing. In the ﬁrst one (called further
as ”Pair-1”),the pairing strength is dependent on proton
number (see Ref. [6] for detail). In the second one called
”Pair-2” (see Ref. [25] for detail), the proton pairing is
made mass dependent via
fπ= 1.877(N+Z)−0.1072, (5)
and neutron pairing is isospin dependent via
fν= 1.208e−0.674|N−Z|
N+Z. (6)
This type ofphenomenologicalscalingofpairingstrength
provides the best reproduction of the experimental pair-
ing indicators (see Ref. [25]). Note that the labels of
the functionals deﬁned with ”Pair-2” pairing contain the
letter ”Y” at/near their end.
The anchor-based optimization method is applied here
forthe DDME, NLME andpoint coupling(PC) classesof
CEDFs(seeRefs.[10,18] andSupplementalMaterial[19]
for technical details). For each class, the functionals with
best global performance such as DD-ME2 [22], NL5(E)
[10] and PC-PK1 [23] are used as a starting point. In
addition, the basic features of their ﬁtting protocols are
employed here. As a consequence, there are 12 anchor
spherical nuclei in the DDME and NLME models and 60
anchorsphericalnucleiinthePCmodel. Thetypesofthe
input data for the ﬁtting protocols and related adopted
errors are summarized in Table 4 of the Supplemental
Material [19].
The optimization of the CEDFs in spherical nuclei is
performed in the following way. First, approximately200
trials of minimization from the sets of initial parameters,
randomly generated in large parameters hyperspace, are
performedusingthesimplexbasedminimizationmethod.
Second, the minimization is repeated by using initial
parameters generated in smaller parameter hyperspaces
around several local minima characterized by the lowest
penalty functions using both simplex-based and simu-
lated annealing3minimization methods. This procedure
guarantees the convergence to the global minimum and
provides information on parametric correlations between
the parameters of CEDFs (see Ref. [18]).
The global performance of existing (DD-ME2, NL5(E)
and PC-PK1) and new (DD-MEX1, DD-MEX2, DD-
MEY, NL5(Y), PC-Y and PC-Y1) functionals obtained
by means of anchor-based optimization method are sum-
marized in Table I. When considering the quality of the
functionals one should take into account the ranges of
the nuclear matter properties (NMPs) recommended for
relativistic functionals in Ref. [11]. These are ρ0≈0.15
fm−3,E/A≈ −16 MeV, K0= 190−270,J= 25−35

The DD-MEX1 functional originates from the DD-
ME2 one: both have the same ﬁtting protocol (see Sup-
plemental Material[19]) but the CEDF DD-ME2 is ﬁtted
at the BCS level employing monopole pairing while the
DD-MEX1 one at the RHB level with the ”Pair-1” sepa-
rable pairing. However, the DD-MEX1 functional, ﬁtted
with anchor-based optimization method, provides a sub-
stantial improvement in the global description of binding
energies (from ∆ Erms= 2.436 MeV for DD-ME2 down
to ∆Erms= 1.651 MeV for DD-MEX1, see Table I).
It also provides a slight improvement in the description
of two-neutron and two-proton separation energies and
charge radii. The most of the NMPs of this functional
arewithin the SET2blimits: theonlyexceptionisincom-
pressibility K0which exceeds the SET2b upper limit.
Itisinterestingtoseewhetherthe bindingenergiesand
charge radii alone can provide a reasonable constraint on
NMPs and neutron skins. For that, the DD-MEX2 and
DD-MEY functionals have been created the ﬁtting pro-
tocols of which do not contain any information on NMPs
and neutron skins (see Table 4 in Supplemental Material
[19]). In addition, the adopted errors for binding ener-
gies are ﬁxed at 1.0 MeV for all nuclei in this class of the
functionals. The DD-MEX2 functional has been opti-
mized with the ”Pair-1” separable pairing. As compared
withDD-ME2(DD-MEX1)itleadstosomeimprovement
(degradation) in the description of binding energies but
provides less accurate description of two-proton and two-
neutronseparationenergiesandchargeradiiascompared
with two above mentioned functionals (see Table I).
The situation drastically improves when the ”Pair-2”
separable pairing is used. This leads to the DD-MEYfunctional which provides second best global description
of binding energies (∆ Erms= 1.734 MeV) and the best
description of the binding energies of the A >70 nuclei
(∆Erms= 1.414MeV) amongconsideredfunctionals [see
Table I] Despite the fact that the DD-MEY functional
was ﬁtted without constraint on NMPs, they are within
the SET2b limits (see Table I). In particular, it gives a
more reasonable value of incompressibility K0than the
DD-MEX1 functional. These facts potentially indicate
the importance of the isospin dependent neutron pairing
in the simultaneous description of binding energies and
NMP. However, the description of two-neutron and two-
proton separation energies with this functional is some-
what worse as compared with the DD-MEX1 one.
To verify the results obtained with anchor based opti-
mization method we also employed the method of min-
imization of Ref. [26] which is used in nuclear mass ta-
ble ﬁts by Brussels group. In this method, the bind-
ing energies of deformed and transitional nuclei are cor-
rected by the deformation energies so the optimization
is carried out for the energies of spherical solution of
the nuclei used in the ﬁtting protocol. In a given nu-
cleus, the deformation energy represents the diﬀerence
between the energies of the global minimum with defor-
mations βi/negationslash= 0 ( i= 2,4,...) and spherical solution
withβi= 0. Because of available computers we used 400
even-even nuclei evenly spread over nuclear chart [start-
ing from actinides and going down to light nuclei and
eliminatingeachsecondeven-evennucleus]inthesecalcu-
lations. The iterative procedure in this method requires
newcalculationsofdeformationenergiesateachiteration
(see Ref. [26] for detail) and it turns out that their con-4
vergenceis quite slow especially in the ”DD-MEX1” type
of the functional. The rms deviations between experi-
mental and calculated binding energies ∆ Ermsobtained
in these calculations are 1.672(0.068)4and 1.613(0.258)
MeV for the ”DD-MEY” and ”DD-MEX1” functionals,
respectively. Thus, the results obtained with this ap-
proachareinlinewiththoseobtainedinanchorbasedop-
timization approach (see Table I); some diﬀerence in the
results are due to diﬀerent selection of the nuclei directly
included into ﬁtting protocol. Note that this approach is
numerically substantially more time consuming as com-
pared with anchor based optimization approach because
(i) substantially more ”spherical” nuclei (400 versus 12)
are used in minimization procedure and (ii) slow conver-
gence of deformation energies in the iterative procedure.
The anchor-based optimization method has been ap-
plied also to the NLME and PC classes of the CEDFs.
In both cases, it leads to an improvement of global de-
scriptionofmasses. TheNL5(E)functional(seeRef.[10])
is the starting point for the optimization of the NL5(Y)
CEDF. Note that the ”Pair-1” and ”Pair-2” separable
pairing is used in the ﬁtting protocols of the NL5(E) and
NL5(Y) CEDFs, respectively. Table I shows that the ap-
plication of anchor based optimization method in combi-
nation with the use of isospin dependent neutron pairing
leads to a substantial improvement of global mass de-
scription and some improvement of the symmetry energy
Jand the slope of the symmetry energy L0. The same
situation exists also for the PC functionals. The anchor
based optimization starting from the PC-PK1 functional
leads to the CEDF PC-Y which provides a substantial
improvement of the global description of binding ener-
gies (see Table I).
Note that the ﬁtting protocols of above mentioned
DDME and NLME functionals include only 12 spherical
anchor nuclei. For these functionals it was veriﬁed that
theincreaseofthenumberofsphericalanchornucleito60
(as in the ﬁtting protocol of the PC-PK1 functional [23])
does not lead to an improvement of the global descrip-
tion of binding energies. The same conclusion is valid
for the PC model: the reduction of the number of the
anchor spherical nuclei from 60 in the PC-Y functional
down to 12 in the PC-Y1 functional (see Table 1 in Sup-
plemental Material [19]) leads to some improvement in
the description of physical observables (see Table I).
With the exception of the DD-MEX2 functional all
CEDFs shown in Table I give comparable rms deviations
for charge radii ∆( rch)rms≈0.026 fm, corresponding to
a high precision of ≈0.5% in charge radii predictions.
These results and the analysis of Ref. [27] suggest that
the inclusion of global data on charge radii will not likely
lead to an appreciable improvement of the functionals.

tion energies due to limited number of iterations in the iter ative
procedure.Fig. 1 illustrates the improvements in the global de-
scription of the masses and related physical observables
whentheanchor-basedoptimizationmethodisemployed.
DD-MEX is the best DDME functional as deﬁned by the
penalty function of the ﬁtting protocol including only
spherical nuclei (see Ref. [18]). However, this bias to-
wards spherical nuclei leads to ∆ Erms= 2.849 MeV in
global description of the masses (see Table I) and ap-
preciable deviations between theory and experiment dis-
played in Figs. 1(a) and (c). In particular, it leads to a
systematic shift of the average Eth−Eexpvalues from
theEth−Eexp= 0 line [see Fig. 1(a)]. In contrast, such
a shift does not appear for the DD-MEY functional [see
Fig. 1(a)] which, in addition, improves the description
of isospin dependence of the Eth−Eexpvalues [compare
Figs. 1 (c) and (d)].
Note that these improvements are obtained by a larger
emphasis on medium and heavy mass nuclei with A >70
in the anchor-based optimization method. For these nu-
clei a substantial improvement in the description of the
masses and two-particle separation energies is obtained
[see Table I and compare Figs. 1 (a) and (b) and Figs. 1
(c) and (d)]. In contrast, the spreads in the Eth−Eexp
values are getting larger for the light ( A <70) nuclei
[compare Figs. 1(a) and (b)]. However, this is not critical
since beyond mean ﬁeld eﬀects are expected to be larger
in light ( A <70) nuclei as compared with heavier ones.
This is in line with the observation that the accuracy
of the description of the masses and two-particle separa-
tion energies improves substantially when light A <70
nuclei are excluded from the analysis (see Table I). This
improvementisespeciallydrasticfortheDD-MEX1, DD-
MEX2, DD-MEY,NL5(Y), PC-YandPC-Y1functionals
deﬁned by the anchor-based optimization method.
It is interesting to compare the performance of these
functionals with those obtained in Skyrme DFT for the
UNEDF* class ofthe functionals which similar to our ap-
proach has been deﬁned at the mean ﬁeld level without
inclusion of rotational and vibrational correlations. The
UNEDF0 [14], UNEDF1 [15], and UNEDF2 [28] EDFs
were optimized by ﬁtting their parameters to large (but
restrictive) sets of experimental data involving spherical
and deformed nuclei. These EDFs describe globally nu-
clearmasseswith∆ Erms= 1.428MeV(UNEDF0), 1.912
MeV (UNEDF1), and 1.950 MeV (UNEDF2). These val-
ues are close to those obtained with the DD-MEX1, DD-
MEY,PC-YandPC-Y1CEDFsbutnumericalcostofthe
optimization of these Skyrme EDFs is drastically larger
than that in the anchor-based optimization method.
In conclusion, a new anchor-based optimization
method of deﬁning the energy density functionals has
been proposed. It combines the simplicity of the ﬁtting
of EDF to spherical nuclei with global information on
the reproduction of experimental masses by EDF. This
is done by correcting the binding energies of the anchor
spherical nuclei used in optimization. As a consequence,
the computational cost of deﬁning a new functional is
drastically lower as compared with alternative methods5

ofthe optimizationwhichsimultaneouslyincludesthe ex-
perimental data on spherical and deformed nuclei. De-
spite that the global performance of the functionals, de-
ﬁned by the anchor-basedoptimization method, becomes
comparable with the one obtained for the UNEDF* class
of non-relativistic Skyrme functionals. Although anchor-
based method is applied here for CEDFs, it can also be
used for non-relativistic Skyrme and Gogny functionals.
The functionals studied in the present paper are re-
stricted to the ones deﬁned at the mean ﬁeld level. How-
ever,the anchor-basedoptimizationmethod canbeeasily
generalized to the approaches which include correlations
beyond mean ﬁeld. For that the RHB approach in thepoint (2) of the anchor-based optimization method pro-
cedure has to be replaced by a respective beyond mean
ﬁeld method (such as ﬁve-dimensional collective Hamil-
tonian [29–31])5. This will allow to bypass the existing
challenge of extreme computational cost of ﬁtting EDF
at the beyond mean ﬁeld level and generate such func-
tionals. It is reasonable to expect that they will lead
to a further improvement of the description of binding
energies (see, for example, Refs. [34, 35]).

in the main body of the manuscript the Supplemental
Material [19] provides citations to Refs. [36–44].

phenomenological rotational corrections to the binding en ergies

done in a number of the calculations of masses (see, for examp le,
