ABSTRACT  
Most of the standard image and video codecs  are block -based and depending upon the compression ratio the 
compressed images /videos  suffer from  different distortions. At low ratios , blurriness is observed and as compression 
increases  blocking artifacts  occur . Generally,  in order to reduce blockiness, images are low-pass filtered which leads 
to more  blurrines s. Also, in bokeh mode images the y are commonly seen: blurriness as a result of  intentional blurred 
background while blocking artifact and global blurriness arising due to  compression. Therefore, such visual media 
suffer from both blockiness and blurriness distortions.  Along with this, noise is also commonly encountered distortion . 
Most of the existing works on quality assessment quantify these distortions individually. This paper proposes a 
methodology to blindly measure overall quality of an image suffering from these  distortions, individually as well as  
jointly. This is achieved  by considering the sum of  absolute values of low and high-frequency  Discrete Frequency 
Transform ( DFT ) coefficients  defined as sum magnitudes . The number of blocks  lying in specific range s of sum 
magnitudes including zero -valued AC coefficients  and mean of 100 maximum and  100 minimum values of these sum 
magnitudes are used as feature vector s. These  features are then fed to  the Machine Learning (ML) based Gaussian 
Process Regression  (GPR)  model, which quantifies  the image quality.  The simulation results show that the proposed 
method can estimat e the quality of images distorted with the  blockiness , blurriness , noise and their combination s.  It 
is relatively fast compared  to many  state-of-art methods , and therefore is suitable for real -time quality monitoring 
applications.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Many techniques inspired by biological systems of living beings are employed in tasks of developing artificially 
intelligent systems, data processing, computation methods, optimization algorithms, etc. As human beings are the end -
users in  a wide range of applications, hence many -a-times techniques are required that closely replicate the human 
biological systems. One such application is Image Quality Assessment  (IQA)  where the methods are designed in a 
way to perceive the quality of visual media according to the Human Visual System (HVS).  Major functionalities of 
neurons in the visual cortex such as freque ncy decompos ition and divisive normalization t ransform of visual signals 
are replicated by suc h quality assessment methods [ 1].  
1.1 MOTIVATION:  
Today , images and videos are popular means of information sharing through social media platforms like Instagram, 
Facebook, YouTube, etc. Furthermore, there is an exponential increase in mobile/Internet data traffic worldwide and 
it is estimated that by the year 2022 , the visual contents will consume about 80 % of total Internet traffic [2]. Despite 
being the main source of information sharing in modern digital era , the most prevalent images and vi deos are likely 
to get contaminated with multiple distortions as they undergo through different stages like acquisition, transmission, 
compression, processing, etc. These operations  introduce noises during acquisition and transmissions, blocking 
artifacts and blurriness during JPEG /MPEG  compression,  blurriness during filtering or processing , etc. The joint effect © <2021 >. This manuscript version is made available under the CC -BY-NC-ND 4. 0 
licens e https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by -nc-nd/4.0/  of the multiple distortions on image quality is perceptually different from the effect caused by single distortion in 
images. Therefore, it becomes important to develop IQA method for multip le distortion s which  have recently gained 
significant attention.  
The image quality can be assessed either subjectively or objectively. Despite being highly consistent, the subjective 
quality evaluation requires a large number of human observers and therefore it is an expensive and time-consuming  
process  and therefore not suitable for real-time applications. Alternatively, objective image qu ality assessment 
techniques do not require any human intervention  and are faster. The objective quality evaluation techniques can be 
classified into three categories: full -reference (F R) which requires the original image to estimate the quality of the 
target image; reduced reference (RR), which does not require the reference image as a whole, rather uses some of its 
features; and no -reference (NR) methods, where the quality is being est imated without the reference (or original) 
image. For most real time applications, the NR (also known as blind) image quality assessment technique is the most 
suitable approach.   
To facilitate the fast excha nge of visual information under  unprecedented traffic growth, the use of efficient 
image/video compression techniques becomes unavoidable. Most of the efficient compression techniques are lossy 
and introduce some degree of distortions as evident from Fig. 1. The highly compressed images /videos are likely to 
be more distorted, so a tradeoff between compression efficiency and image/video quality needs  to be properly 
managed.  It requires a fast and accurate blind quality assessment technique so that the trade -off between quality and 
degree  of compression can be managed on a real -time basis. In coded  images/videos, two commonly encountered 
distortions are the blockiness and blurriness  artefacts . The blocking arte facts are observed in block -based JPEG (Joint 
Photographic Experts Group ) and H. 26x/MPEG  (Moving Picture Experts Group ) coded images /videos  when a 
significant difference in quantized DC coefficients of adjacent blocks occurs . On the other hand, coded images appear 
to be blurred wh en either the image is coded at low compression ratio s causing the removal of the high frequency 
components, or when the processing like low pass filtering (or loop filtering  in standard video coders ) are empl oyed

licens e https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by -nc-nd/4.0/  to remove the blocking arte facts (specific ally in video coding). These  two compression related distortions i.e. 
blockiness and blurriness go hand in hand in images /videos . It has been observed that i nitially at very low  compression  
rate, first  blurriness appears  and as the rate is f urther stepped up, blocking arte fact become s visible [3 ]. Some authors 
have exploited such relation between blockiness and blurriness, for designing more efficient image/video quality 
assessment (IQA) tool . For example, if reference image or its partial informati on is available, then by measuring the 
gain and loss at block boundaries , one can design a very efficient IQA [4].  To verify this observation, an  image from 
CSIQ database [5 ] is compressed at different compression ratios  (CR) and corresponding decoded images are shown  
in Fig. 1. For better visualization a portion of image shown in Yellow Square is cropped and enlarged. The pristine  
image  of Fig. 1(a) is compressed at CR = 20, 40 , 65 and 120  which are shown in Figs. 1(b)-(e) respectively . Initially 
at low compression ratio (CR= 20) the image  of Fig. 1(b) tends to lose  the sharpness , as fine lines of corn skin are 
disappearing  when compared with the original image.   As the CR is increased  to 65 , more blurriness is intro duced.  
When the compression ratio becomes very high  (CR=120) , blocking arte facts becomes promin ent as apparent from  
Fig. 1 (e). From this  example,  it is visually evident that block -based compression techniques introduce both blurriness 
as well as blockiness. Thus, any compressed image/video has a mixture of both distortions.  Another scenario  where 
a combination of these two distortions appear  in coexistence  is when loop -filtering  is employed , especially in the video 
encoder  loop. Moreover, Additive White Gaussian noise (AWGN) is also commonly experienced distortion which 
generally affects the perceptual quality of images by introducing a high -frequency random component. The motivation 
of the proposed work is to develop an IQA method that can accurately estimate the quality of images di storted with 
blockiness , blurriness  and/or noise  (individually or jointly).  
1.2 RELATED WORK : 
 The existing blind or NR -IQA (no -reference IQA) methods can be categorized into  two broad groups, namely: 
distortion specific methods and generic methods. Sometimes, the nature of distortion may be known e.g., quantization, 
distortions due to camera motion, inherent noise sources inside c amera, low -pass filtering, etc.  However, in ma ny 
cases the source and nature of distortions are anonymous. The distortion specific methods, as the name suggest s, are 
designed to measure image quality under a specific type of single distortion. They can be employed when  the image 
is exposed to a single  known type of distortion. In contrast,  generic methods are designed to assess different kinds  of 
individual distortions .  
In the distortion  specific IQA methods, we  consider here the methods specifi cally designed for blurriness , blocking 
artefacts  or noise . The quality of blurred images can be assessed by measuring the spread of edges  [6]- [8], by 
measur ing the just noticeable blur (JNB) [9] - [11], or by computing kurtosis on the Discrete Cosine Transform ( DCT ) 
block s [12].  In [ 13], authors use  Maximum Local Variat ion (MLV) for each pixel  to estima te the sharpness of an 
image . The MLV’s are assigned weights and their standard deviation is used to measure  the degree of sharpness , 
which is then used to quantify the blurriness . The concept of Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) was 
exploited by Zhang et al. in [14 ] to detect blurriness in images while re -blurring it. It  is a two -step framework in which 
first the image is filtered by a Gaussian low pass filter ( GLPF) and then the corresponding changes in histogram are 
analyzed to determine extent of blurriness. In [15 ], authors have used the Exact Zernike Moments & Gradient 
Magnitude (EZMGM) for establishing a blurriness metric.  H. Liu et al. have proposed a blur  metric in [16 ] which 
utilizes edge blur and neural network and works well on images hav ing intentionally blurred background.  
Similarly, numerous techniques have been developed to measure the distortion  due to blocking artefacts  [17]-[24]. 
Most of these te chniques exploit the frequency -domain characteristics , mainly t he Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) 
[17], [21 ], and Dis crete Cosine Transform (DCT) [18], [20 ]. The combination of DFT and DCT has also been exploited 
to assess the quali ty of JPEG compressed images [22 ], where authors use the number of zero -valued coefficients in 
DCT transformed blocks, weighted by DFT -generated quality maps as features to assess the degree of blockiness. 
Though the concept is simple and effective, but it has poor a ccuracy for most of the standard databases. A gradient -
based technique is proposed in  [23], in which for each 8×8 pixels non-overlapping block, two parameters namely 
luminance change (across adjacent blocks) and degree of blockiness (evaluated by adding th e horizontal and vertical © <2021 >. This manuscript version is made available under the CC -BY-NC-ND 4. 0 
licens e https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by -nc-nd/4.0/  derivatives) are determined to measure the image quality. In general,  this method has a better accuracy, but it fails to 
accurately estimate the quality if blocks are surrounded w ith flat regions. Zhu et al. [24 ] proposed a techni que based 
on quality factor (QF) and recompression of a lready compressed JPEG images.   The methods proposed in [25 ]- [28] 
were developed for quality assessment of noisy images.  
Most of the methods mentioned  above  though have  good performance  on either of distortions  individually but they 
become very inefficient for images distorted with more than one type of distortions . As in  the present era, the images 
are likely to be exposed to commingled distortions, diverse kind of  generic IQA  method s are required which can 
estimate image quality in presence of multiple known/unknown distortions with high accuracy . Some of the relevant 
generic methods are reviewed  next.  
A full reference method capable of assessing image quality distorted by both blurriness and blockiness using  frequency 
domain approach is proposed in [3].  A number of generic blind image quality assessment  methods exists like [29] - 
[39]. The majority of these methods are based on Natural Scene S tatisti cs (NSS) of the image [29] - [34], [37], [39 ], 
etc. which  rely on the fact that when an image is exposed to distortions, its statistical parameters get changed, which 
can be utilized to esti mate the degree of distortion in the image. The NSS features may be extracted either in spatial 
domain or in transform domain or in a combination of both. Moorthy and Bovik proposed a technique named DIIVINE  
(Distortion Identification -based Ima ge Verity an d INtegrity Evalua tion) [31]  which assess the image quality in two 
steps. Identification of distortion in the first step is followed by the quantification of degree of distortion in the second 
step. It uses wavelet transform to obtain statistical features and Gaussian Scale Mixture for modelling the fe atures. 
This method uses a large feature size (a total of 88 features), which obviously makes it too complex . BLIINDS 2 
(BLind Image Integrity Notator using DCT Statistics)  [32] is a method that uses fewer number of DCT -based NSS 
features .  Here the DCT coefficients of each block are modelled using Generalized Gaussian density (GGD) model 
and the parameters of GGD model are fed to Bayesian regression model to quantify the image qu ality.  Though 
BLINDS 2 [32] method has better efficiency as compared to DIIVINE  [31] method, the large processing time due to 
the use of non -linear sorting of block -based features in  BLIINDS 2 [32] makes it slow and imposes restriction for its 
use in many applications [29 ]. The BRISQUE (B lind / Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluato r) [29] method 
is a spatial domain NSS based method, which uses Mean Subtracted Contrast Normalized (MSCN) coefficients of 
image to develop a quality assessment metric. Tho ugh BRISQUE  is one of the fastest (in terms of computational time) 
IQA method, but it perform s poorly for specific type of images as in TID2013 database [40 ]. Xue et al. [33] have 
utilized Gradient magnitude (G M) and Laplacian of Gaussian (Lo G) jointly to study the effect of local luminance 
changes and intensity variations respectively on the image quality, as they ar e closely related to the HVS . This method 
measures the quality of  images exposed to blocking arte facts accurately but has relativel y lower accuracy for blurred 
images. A combination  of both spatial and transform domain features have bee n utilized in FRIQUEE ( Feature Maps –
Based Referenceless Image Quali ty Evaluation Engine) method [37 ]. A large number of features across different color  
spaces makes it complex and time -consuming. Li et al. in [39 ] proposed a blind method based on log -contract 
distribution to exploit spatial and directional correlations in images. This method suffers from data dependency and 
its accuracy for cross -databas e validations is not satisfactory .  The methods discussed here are ML based, whereas 
learning free generic methods like NIQE [41] and IL -NIQE  [42] also exit . The work of M H Pinson [43] draws 
attention towards assessment of visual media from the perspective of consumer applications.  The methods like 
BRISQUE  [29], NIQE  [41], IL-NIQE  [42], etc. have been tested for multiple distortions, but found to have poor 
performance for these distor tions as well as for unseen data.   Additionally, few multiple distortion methods  [44]-[47] 
have also been proposed to assess the image quality in presence of two or more commingled type of distortions. GWH-
GLBP [44 ] was proposed by Li et al. to assess multiple distortio ns in images. It is based on structural information 
wherein local binary pattern  (LBP)  from the gradient map of the test image is used to form the weighted histograms.  
Miao et. al [45]  have proposed another method based on LBP in P hase Congruency domain to take into account low 
level features. It also employs gradient magnitude as a weighing factor . Six-step blin d metric ( SISBLIM ) [46] is a 
training free metric based on joint effect’s prediction, and HVS based fusion model. A significant effort has been 
made  by VQEG (Video Quality Experts Group) [48] for quality assessment of visual media  under projects  like © <2021 >. This manuscript version is made available under the CC -BY-NC-ND 4. 0

of key indicators to define the service quality of audio -visual signals  were proposed  in the MOAVI project.  The 
NORM  project  is concerned with  research and development and sharing of resources of  NR metrics .  
Most of generic IQA methods developed to measure image quality in presence of multiple distortions either suffer 
with large time -complexity or with poor accuracy. In context of multiple distorted images, many state -of-art methods 
give poor performance when tes ted on images exposed to multiple distortion s, due to the joint effect of various 
distortion s.  Furthermore, multiple distortions IQA area could not receive much attention possibly due to the lack of 
benchmark databases as well as its challenging nature.  Hence, there is a need of an IQA method which can assess 
quality of images having multiple distortions with higher accuracy and lower complexity.   
To overcome the drawbacks of IQA methods that measure image quality under multiple distortion conditions, we 
propose a DFT -based technique to estimate the quality of images distorted  with blocking artefact , blurriness , noise  
individually  or in combination of two or more of these distortions . Though  DFT and MSCN coefficients individually 
have been widely utilized in many IQA methods, less efforts have been made to combine the benefits of both these 
methods. We believe that the novelty of our proposed method lies in developing an IQA method by utilizing the DFT 
of MSCN coefficients. Most of the existing MSCN methods use the univariate probabilistic models for fitting 
distributions which are insufficient in apprehending correlation properties. A nother limitation arises when only 
neighbouring pixels are considered, as distortion generally corrupts multiple pairs simultaneously and hence are 
inappropriate for complex types of distortions. To overcome these limitations, a unique method based on MSCN  and 
DFT is proposed. To be specific, the novelty of this work lies in: (i) utilization of the combination of the MSCN with 
DFT which helps in obtaining a highly decorrelated low -dimensional space (ii) considering the effect of distortion on 
multiple pixel s (rather than only neighbouring pixels) from a suitable sized block of coefficients. The proposed 
technique first  computes the MSCN coefficients of input  image. The original image as well as MSCN coefficients are 
then transformed into frequency domain usi ng 88 block -based DFT. The DFT coefficients of each block are then 
divided into low, medium and high frequency bands. The high and low frequency band  coefficients are summed into 
a sum parameter, obtained from  DFT of original image and DFT of MSCN coefficients  to extract features . For 
normalized sum parameters, n umber of blocks  lying in t he specific  ranges are counted including the zero -valued 
coefficients along with the mean of 100 largest  and 100 smallest  values of these sum parameters are computed to form 
the feature vectors. All these features are then fed  to Gaussian  Process Regression (GPR) model [ 51] with exponential 
kernel for quality estimation. The proposed method has much better accuracy over the methods developed to measure 
these distortions separately.  
The organization  of paper  is as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews the DFT and MSCN, which are being used in the 
proposed method. Section 3 gives the details of the proposed methodology.  Section 4 includes the simulation results 
and discussions on these results.  Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 5. 
2. BACKGROUND  
Since proposed IQA method exploits DFT - domain features of image combi ned with DFT of MSCN coefficients of 
input image, hence, in this section DFT and MSCN coefficient computations and their characteristics are briefly 
reviewed.  
2.1 Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) : 
It is a well observed  fact that distortions in images affect  their frequency  distribution  characteristics. Therefore, the 
relative changes in strengths of high and low frequency components of images can be used to determine if an image 
is distorted with blocking artefact , noise and blurriness. These variations can e asily be captured by DFT, making it an 
obvious choice in this work.  Fig. 2 shows a set of eight images taken from LIVE [ 52] database where Figs. 2(a) and  © <2021 >. This manuscript version is made available under the CC -BY-NC-ND 4. 0

DMOS ) values. Similarly , Figs. 2(j) -(l) are  images exposed to Gaussian blurriness, arranged in order of increasing 
DMOS. Block -based 8×8 DFT is applied to each block, and magnitude of DF T coefficients of a block at 
correspondingly same location (shown with yellow square) in each image are also shown in Figs. 2(e) -(h) and Figs. 
2(m) -(p) corresponding to images shown in Figs. 2(a) -(d) and Figs. 2(j) -(l) respectively.  From these figures it can be 
observed that distribution of DFT coefficients vary with the nature and degree o f degradation (arte fact) present in 
images.  These fluctuations in magnitude of DFT coefficients can be utilized for quality assessment of images.  The 2 -
D DFT F(u,v)  can be computed as in Eqn. (1), where I(m,n) is the gray -scale image (or image block), having N×M 
pixels.

In order to visualize spectrum symmetry of DFT, generally the spectrum is circularly shifted to bring the zero 
frequency (u=0, v=0) at  the center, which is also treated as origin of spectral plane, as depicted in Fig. 3(a). The 
frequency shifting can be represented mathematically as in Eqn. (2):

Eqn. (1).  After frequency shifting, coefficients of each block are indexed using Manhattan Distance between DC 
coefficient and other coefficients of th e block. Accordingly, the index ‘ i’ of frequency coefficient located at (u, v) is 
computed as:  
𝑖=|𝑢0−𝑢|+|𝑣0−𝑣|                                                                                                                                                                  (3)    
where ( 𝑢0,𝑣0) represents  co-ordinate s of the DC coefficient at center  (0,0). According to Eq n. (3), the frequency 
coefficients are numerically indexed in terms of increasing frequency using Manhattan distance , irrespective of 
direction they occur.  The DFT coefficients of an 8×8 block can then be divided into low, medium and high frequencies 
depending upon their frequency index ‘i’, as shown in Fig.3 (b). Here DFT coefficients of an 8×8 block is indexed  
from 0 -8 depending upon their Manhattan   distance. The DC component  lying at the center is  indexed as ‘0’. As one 
moves  away from the center , the frequenc y index  ‘i’ increases.  In the proposed scheme, we will use this indexing to 
segregate low and high fr equency DFT coefficients.   
2.2 Mean Subtracted Contrast Normalized Coefficients  (MSCN):  
Human Visual System (HVS) is habituated to its natural surroundings. This feature is embodied in Natural Scene 
Statistics (NSS) Model [ 53]. Over  past decade s, researchers have employed NSS for esta blishing several IQA metrics 
[29] - [34], [37], [39 ], [41],  [42], etc.  showing the  relevance  of NSS  to human perceptions. An important parameter 
derived from NSS model is MSCN [29]. Mathematically, it can be represented as:  
𝐼̂(𝑚,𝑛)=𝐼(𝑚,𝑛)−𝜇(𝑚,𝑛)   
𝜎(𝑚,𝑛)+1                                                                                                                                                    (4) 
In Eqn.(4) gray-scale image  is denoted as 𝐼(𝑚,𝑛), m ϵ {1,2,…..M} (M denotes  image  height ), n ϵ {1,2,…..N} (N 
denotes image width) are spatial indices.

a Gaussian weighting function . It is sampled out to 3 standard deviations  where K=L=3 and rescaled to unity volume. 
In terms of symmetr y, it has 2D circular symmetry. This kind of normaliz ation performs almost similar operation as

responses [1]. Cells of visual cortex give non -linear response especially  in cases of high contrast where  linearity -based  
models fail [ 54].  Subtraction of mean from the image helps in eliminating the effect o f uneven illumination. The 
variance field itself is capable of showing local edges and high contrast details. The combin ed normalization process 
brings the intensity values in a normalized range; leaving behind a highly decorrelated homogenous image with low 
energy edges having impo rtant structural information [2 9]. This normalization helps in removing of spatial 
redundancies, giving a homogenous appearance. It works on similar pattern like the non -linear response of visual 
neurons. Fig.4 shows two sets of imag es chosen from CSIQ Database [5 ] where Row 1 shows a set of JPEG 
compressed i mages while Row 3 consist s of images distorted by blurriness  arranged in  increasing  order of distortion. 
Row s 2 and 4 show the corresponding image s after MSCN operation for JPEG and blurred imag es of Row s 1 and 3 
respectively. The presence of residual boun daries having low energy can be visualize d in second and fourth rows.  
3. PROPOSED IQA METHODOLOGY  
The block diagram of the proposed IQA algorithm to estimate the quality of images separately/ jointly corrupted  with 
blockiness , blurriness  and noise  is shown in Fig. 5 . It works as follows.  First a gray -level input  image is normalize d 
to get corresponding  MSCN image. The  pristine  image as well  as MSCN coefficients are then transformed i nto 
frequency domain using 8×8 DFT. The frequency coefficients of every block in each image are divided into low and 
high frequency bands. After frequency domain transformation, four sum parameters are  obtained by adding the high 
and low frequency coefficients for DFT blocks obtained from gray and MSCN images. For these sum parameters, we 
determine the Normalization Factor (NF) using the variance of block count for sum -parameters. After normalizing the 
sum-parameters with NF, the number of blocks having values of these parameters i n specific range s are counted . 
These block -counts are used as features . Generally, frequency domain distribution of undistorted natural images is 
peaky with heavy tails while for noisy images it is otherwise . As noise affects the high frequency co mponen ts, the 
mean of hundred largest  and hundred  smallest  values of  high frequency  sum parameter s are also computed as features.  
For mapping the features  on quality scale , Gaussian Process Regression model [ 51] with exponential kernel is used.  
Various components of the proposed method are described below.  
3.1 Motivation f or combining DFT with MSCN:  
The motivation to use DFT along with MSCN in the proposed work can be justified in terms of the number of zero -
valued coefficients in a DFT block.  The zero -valued DFT coefficients was first p roposed by Golestaneh et al. [22 ] 
for estimating the degradation in a block of pixels in an image , which is also used in this work to access the quality of 
images. For this purpose, we have considered three (an original and two distorted) versions of the same image as 
shown in Figs. 6(a) , 6(d) and 6(g) respectively. These images are taken from LIVE database [ 52], and their  
corresponding DMOS values are 0, 47.28 and 83.55 respectively. That is image of Fig. 6(g) has more distortions (poor 
quality) than the image of Fig. 6(d). Each image is  then 8 ×8 DFT transformed (either directly or after MSCN 
normalization). Then zero -valued coefficients are mapped with black pixel and non -zero valued coefficients with 
white pixels. The directly DFT transformed and mapped images are shown in Figs. 6(b), 6 (e) and 6(h) corresponding 
to the images of Figs. 6(a), 6(d) and 6(g) respectively. Similarly, Figs. 6(c), 6(f) and 6(i) show the black & white 
mapped DFT coefficients of MSCN normalized versions of images of Figs. 6(a), 6(d) and 6(g) respectively. It can be 
observed from these figures that as distortion increases, the number of zero -valued DFT coefficients (black pixels) 
increases. Furthermore, it can be observed by comparing Figs. 6(e) with 6(f) and Figs. 6(h) with 6(i), that DFT with 
MSCN can differentia te the local distortions much better than DFT only coefficients.   
Further to justify why DFT coefficients with and without MSCN are considered in the proposed work, we have 
considered six set s of JPEG images (original and distorted versions) from the  LIVE  database [ 52] where original six 
images (Image 1, Image2, …, Image 6) are shown in Fig. 7.  Each set of images (original as well as distorted) are 
transformed using 8 ×8 DFT and the number of zero -valued coefficients in transformed image are computed. In o rder 
to get the idea of correlation between zero -valued DFT coefficients and corresponding image quality (in terms of 
DMOS value), the number of zero -valued DFT coefficients for each set of images  are plotted against DMOS value  © <2021 >. This manuscript version is made available under the CC -BY-NC-ND 4. 0

for first 4 images (Image 1 -4), the number of zero -valued coefficients are highly correlated with DMOS, but there 
exists a poor correlatio n between these parameters for Image 5 and Image 6. It may be noted that these two images 
(Image 5 and Image 6) have locally blurred regions. Thus, the number of zero -valued ac coefficients in DFT 
transformed images fail to correlate with image quality of locally distorted images. However, when the same set of 
images are DFT transformed after MSCN normalization, then the number of zero -valued coefficients have good 
correlation with DMOS of corresponding images for locally distorted image, as shown with red -color in Fig. 7 (b), 
but it has poor correlations for globally distorted images (Image 1 -4). It should be noted for these images (Image 1 -
4), number of zero -valued DFT coefficients (for gray image) has good correlation as evident from Fig. 7 (a).  Hence, 
in order to have better qua lity estimate for every distorted image, features from DFT transformed images, both with 
and without MSCN should be computed.  These features are then passed to a Machine Learning algorithm for further 
processing.  
3.2 Frequency segregation:  
As discussed ea rlier, DFT is applied to the input image on a block -by-block basis (size 8×8 pixels). Parallel to this, 
MSCN coeff icients are extracted from the image  to take into account the characteristics of NSS model inspired by 
HVS. The computed MSCN coefficients are  also transformed to frequency domain by employing the block -based 
DFT.  In this way, two (with and without MSCN) frequency domain representations of the image are obtained. Let 
the DFT transform of gray -scale input image (𝐼(𝑚,𝑛)) and its MSCN normalized version ( 𝐼̂(𝑚,𝑛)) be  𝐹𝑔(u,v) and 
𝐹𝑚(u,v) respectively.  It is observed that the energy distribution in low and high frequency components of image is 
likely to be differ ent for different types of distortion s in image. Furthermore, since the  energy contained  in a DFT 
coefficient is equal to the square of its absolute value, therefore we consider only the magnitude of DFT coefficients. 
Let the absolute values of 𝐹𝑔(u,v) and  𝐹𝑚(u,v)  be denoted as |𝐹𝑔(𝑢,𝑣)| and |𝐹𝑚(𝑢,𝑣)| respectively.   
Further, as di scussed previously in Section 2 .1 that in  order to segregate the low and high frequencies, the DFT 
coefficients of a block are indexed on the basis of Manhattan distance from the DC coefficient of the block, as defined 
in Eqn. (3). The coefficients with the same frequency index are gro uped togeth er as shown in Fig. 3 (c), and all AC 
coefficients having frequency indices 1-3 are labelled as low -frequency (LF) coefficients, index 4 as middle frequency 
coefficient (MF) and indices 5-8 as high -frequency (HF) coefficients. In the proposed work, only coe fficients 
belonging to LF and HF bands will be used for feature extraction. If 𝐹𝑘,𝑔={𝐹𝑔(𝑢,𝑣)}𝑘 and 𝐹𝑘,𝑚={𝐹𝑚(𝑢,𝑣)}𝑘  
represent the set of all DFT coefficients of a DFT block (without and with MSCN respectively) having kth frequency 
index, then LF and HF band of image in DFT domain (without and with MSCN) are the set of all DFT coefficients 
with frequency indices 1-3 and 5-8, and can be represented according to Eqns. (7) -(10) for each block : 
 𝐿𝐹𝑔=⋃ {𝐹𝑘,𝑔}3
𝑘=1                                                                                                                                                         (7)

𝑘=5                                                (10) 
3.3 Four Sum -parameters:  
In order to determine the feature vectors, we propose to sum the magnitudes of all DFT coefficients belonging to sets 
𝐿𝐹𝑔,𝐻𝐹𝑔,𝐿𝐹𝑚, 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝐻𝐹𝑚, as defined in Eqns. (11) -(14) respectively, to be considered as feature to quantify the quality 
of distorted images.   © <2021 >. This manuscript version is made available under the CC -BY-NC-ND 4. 0

𝑘=5                 (14) 
Since the range in which the values in set of sum parameters 𝑆𝑔𝐿𝐹, 𝑆𝑔𝐻𝐹, 𝑆𝑚𝐿𝐹, and 𝑆𝑚𝐻𝐹 lie is different and they also 
depend on the nature of distortions. For further processing, each of sum -parameters should be normalized on the scale 
of 0 to 1 , which is discussed next.  
3.4 Normalization Factor:  
The set of four parameters related to low -frequency and high -frequency components of DFT (with and without MSCN) 
defined in Eqns. (11) - (14) above, may have any values depending upon image content and nature/degree of 
distortions.   In order to get an idea about the  range of these four sum parameters, a set of 100 images from GBLUR  
(Gaussian Blur) and JPEG compressed subsets of LIVE Database [ 52] are selected randomly. For each of the images,

licens e https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by -nc-nd/4.0/  the set of four sum parameters defined in Eqns. (11) - (14) were evaluated.  The number of blocks that exist in different 
ranges of these sum -parameters are computed. The number of times a specific bin value (which corresponds to number 
of blocks) occurs for all 100 images are counted individually for each sum parameter and varian ce of these counts is 
shown in Fig. 8.  The variance of values (corresponding to each bin) is utilized to determine the maximum range of 
each of the sum -parameters.  The bin size for Fig.8 (a) is 100 whereas for remaining parameters ( Figs. 8(b), 8(c), and 
8(d)), the bin -size is 1.   From Fig. 8, it is clear that most of images have values of  individual sum parameters from the 
sets  𝑆𝑔𝐿𝐹, 𝑆𝑔𝐻𝐹, 𝑆𝑚𝐿𝐹, and 𝑆𝑚𝐻𝐹 lying in the range of 0 -10 (bin -size 100, Fig. 8(a)), 0 -100 (Fig. 8(c)), 0 -100 (F ig. 8(b)) 
and 0 -20 (Fig. 8(d)) respectively. In order to bring them in common range of 0 to 1, there is a need of normalization. 
The maximum range for each sum parameter is considered as normalization factor (NF), so that each sum parameter 
can be expresse d on the scale of 0 to 1.  The normalization factor s (NF) for the four sets of sum-parameters  𝑆𝑔𝐿𝐹, 𝑆𝑔𝐻𝐹, 
𝑆𝑚𝐿𝐹, and 𝑆𝑚𝐻𝐹are 1000, 100, 100 and 20 respectively. After determining the sum -parameters, they are divided by their 
respective NF to ensure that normalized value of these parameter s remain on the scale of 0 to 1.  It may be noted that 
the normalization factor ensures t hat both types of distortions are defined within a common scale.   
3.5 Feature extraction:  
Finally, features are extracted as follows. Since all sum parameters are normalized on the scale of 0 to 1, where zero  
values  of each of sum -parameter corresponds to zero -valued AC coefficients in the image. Therefore, the number of 
blocks with zero -value of each of sum parameter are used as four features (one for each sum parameter). The entire 
range (except zero value) is divided into four equal parts 0 -0.25 (excluding 0), 0.25 -0.50, 0.50 -0.75 and 0.75 -1.0. The 
number of blocks having each of sum -paramete rs in each of four ranges will constitute 4 ×4=16 features. As images 
may be of different sizes, therefore percentage of blocks rather than absolute number of blocks for each of sum -
parameter lying in different ranges are co nsidered as feature vectors. Sinc e there are a total of four sum -parameters 
and each is divided into 5 classes, therefore we get 20 feature s in this manner . These  20 feature vectors are defined in 
Table 1, and these are the numbers of blocks belonging to each class divided by total number of blocks in an image . 
The features f1, f2, f3, f4 and f5 are percentages of blocks having normalized values of sum -parameter  from set  𝑆𝑔𝐿𝐹 as 
0, in the range of 0 -0.25, 0.25 -0.50, 0.50 -0.75 and 0.75 -1.0 respectively. Similarly, f 6-f10 correspon d to sum -parameter  
set 𝑆𝑚𝐿𝐹, f11-f15 to 𝑆𝑔𝐻𝐹 and f 16-f20 to 𝑆𝑚𝐿𝐹, f11-f15 to 𝑆𝑔𝐻𝐹 and f 16-f20 to 𝑆𝑚𝐻𝐹. In addition to this, four more featur es (f21 -
f24) are extracted by calculating the  mean of hundred largest  and hundred  smallest  values from  the set of  sum 
parameters  𝑆𝑔𝐻𝐹 and 𝑆𝑚𝐻𝐹 respectively . Hence , a total of 24 features are derived  from the four sum -parameter  sets.  
3.6 Regression stage:  
ML-based Regression module is used for mapping the feature  vectors  to their respective quality scores. Gaussian 
process regression (GPR) is a kernel -based supervised approach and non -parametric in nature.  There are many of its 
variants depending on kernel function used , such as  linear, ex ponential, square exponential, a combination of multiple 
kernels, etc. In the present work, e xponential GPR module is used to map frequency domain NSS features of the image 
to its quality score.  
Gaussian Process (GP)  is a stochastic process that can be rep resented as a distribution over function  ξ such that it maps  
input feature space  F (in our case feature vectors) to output space  D (here space consisting of DMOS of images) . It 
can be modelled  using the mean 𝑚(𝑓) and the covariance 𝐶(𝑓,𝑓′) (also works as kernel of GP) as defined in Eq n.15 
and Eqn.16 respectively.  
𝑚(𝑓)=𝐸[𝜉(𝑓)]                                                                                                                                                                   (15) 
𝐶(𝑓,𝑓′)=𝐸[(𝜉(𝑓)−𝑚(𝑓))(𝜉(𝑓′)−𝑚(𝑓′))]                                                                                                                                       (16) 
In Eq n.16 f and f’ are elements of set  F and E is the expectation operator. In the proposed framework , the input space 
F is the set of features f1 to f20 listed in Table I . GP is then a non -linear function of m(f) and C(f, f’) and is defined in 
Eqn. 17 as  follows:  © <2021 >. This manuscript version is made available under the CC -BY-NC-ND 4. 0

It achieves the mapping of inputs 𝑓𝑖∈ F to an output space 𝑑𝑖∈D by imposing restriction  that a group  of input -output  
training points {( 𝑓𝑖,𝑑𝑖)|𝑖=1,.,.,.,𝑛} are known , in priory  in order to obtain the posterior distribution.  The output  d 
of the GP model is a noisy observation represented  as: 
𝑑=𝜉(𝑓)+ έ                                                                                                                                                                         (18) 
where  έ is the additive Gaussian noise  𝑁(0,𝜎2). To obtain the predicted output  DMOS  values from testing dataset, 
this posterior distribution is used.  The covariance , being the kernel of GP model is  also known , whose hyper 
parameters  are optimized during  the training phase . The joint distribution of training output dtr and test output  dp is to 
be defined as:  
[𝑑𝑡𝑟
𝑑𝑝]~𝑁(0,[𝐶(𝐹,𝐹)+𝜎𝑛2𝐼𝐶(𝐹,𝐹∗)
𝐶(𝐹,𝐹) 𝐶(𝐹,𝐹∗)])                                                                                                                   (19) 
Where F and 𝐹∗ are feature vectors  for training and test data respectively. The standard deviation of noise is given by 
𝜎𝑛2𝐼 where I is the identity matrix (N -dimensional).  To obtain the predictive function, the observation 𝑑𝑝 is conditioned 
on  𝑑𝑡𝑟 such that  
𝑑𝑝|𝐹,𝑑𝑡𝑟,𝐹∗~𝑁(𝑑𝑝̅̅̅,𝑉(𝑑𝑝))                                                                                                                                                 (20) 
where  𝑑𝑝̅̅̅=𝐶(𝐹∗,𝐹)[𝐶(𝐹,𝐹)+ 𝜎𝑛2𝐼]−1𝑑𝑡𝑟,                                                                                                                        (21) 
𝑉(𝑑𝑝)= 𝐶(𝐹∗,𝐹∗)− 𝐶(𝐹∗,) [𝐶(𝐹,𝐹)+ 𝜎𝑛2𝐼]−1 𝐶(𝐹,𝐹∗)                                                                                        (22) 
GP predicts the output 𝑑𝑝 using this predictive distribution. The test output which is the predicted  DMOS  is 𝑑𝑝 as 
defined in Eq n. 20. For more details on GP one can refer to [ 51]. Regression Learner App from the Machine Learning 
toolbox  of MATLAB 18a is used in this work for th e training and validation of GP model . 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

perception on t he relevant well -known single -distortion based databases LIVE [ 52], CSIQ [5] , TID2013 [40 ] and

4.1 Database s and Evaluation criteria:  
Several databases involving  different type s of images exposed to varying type s and levels of distortions  are available . 
The details of some of the used databases are as follows : 
• LIVE [52] consists of 29 reference images, 233 are aff licted to JPEG compression,  174 are exposed to 
GBLUR and 145 images have undergone AWGN type of distortion  referred here as LIVE .  
• The CSIQ  [5] database has 30 reference images, along with 150 distorted images in JPEG,  BLUR  and AWGN  
sub-datasets respectively  referred here as CSIQ . © <2021 >. This manuscript version is made available under the CC -BY-NC-ND 4. 0 
licens e https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by -nc-nd/4.0/  • TID2013  [40] database has a total of 24 types of distortions with 25 reference images out of which 120 are 
JPEG -compressed,  120 are exposed to GBLUR  and 120 afflicted with AWGN  referred as TID2013 in this 
work . Five images in each s ub-set are not included as they are not natural images.   
• KADID -10k [5 5] is the largest single distortion -based  dataset consisting of 10,125 distorted images obtained 
from 81 reference images. This work includes GBLUR, JPEG compression and AWGN subsets consisting 
405 distorted images respectively . 
• LIVE MD database [5 6] has a total of 405 distorted images out of which 270 are multiply distorted. It consists 
of 15 reference images which are exposed to three distortion types (Gaussian blur, JPEG comp ression, and 
white Gaussian noise). In addition to  individual subsets exposed to single type of distortion, the database has 
two sub -sets exposed to multiple distortions of type : (i) Gaussian blur followed by JPEG compression  and 
(ii) Gaussian Blur followe d by White Noise (WN) . These two subsets  are used to assess the quality of 
multiply distorted images and is referred here as LIVE MD.  
• IVL MD database [5 7], [58] has 10 original images and it is divided into two subsets of multiply distorted 
images consisting of 750 multiply distorted images. The database consists of two subsets: 1) Blur -JPEG  
where each original image undergoes 7 levels  of Gaussian blur, then each  resultant blur image undergoes 5 
levels of JPEG compression  and 2)  Noise -JPEG where each reference image is afflicted with 10 levels of 
Gaussian Noise and each noisy image is exposed to 4 levels of JPEG compression.  
• The Multiply Distorted Image Database 2 013 (MDID2013) database [ 46] comprises of 324 multiply distorted 
images, generated by successively distorting 12 original images by three types of distortions (GBLUR, JPEG, 
and WN).  
• The Multiply Distorted Image Database (MDID) [5 9] (different from MDID2013 ) contains 20 reference and 
1600 multiply distorted images by introducing five types of distortions: Gaussian noise, Gaussian blur, 
contrast change, JPEG, and JPEG2000 compression. In this work, Gaussian noise, Gaussian blur and JPEG 
afflicted images have been used for analysis and referred to as MDID.  
• IBBI [16] , [60] database has 12 reference images and 60 distorted images having intentionally blurred 
background.  
For performance evaluation different criteria have been used mainly: Spearman rank order correlation coefficient 
(SROCC), Pearson linear correlation coefficient (PLCC ), Kendall’s Rank -order Correlation Coefficient (KR OCC) 
and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The  range for SROCC, KR OCC and PLCC is [ -1, 1], whereas RMSE is a 
non-negative real number. These p arameters depict the correlation between  predicted and subjective scores. A lower 
RMSE and a higher SROCC/PLCC/KR OCC depict a good correlation with the subjective judgments.  Due to non -
linear human response system, there may be non -linearity in subjective and predictive scores. Hence, a logistic

GMLoG [33], NFERM [34], FRIQUEE [37], GWH -GLBP [4 4], NIQE [41], IL -NIQE [42 ], Miao [45 ] and SISBLIM 
[46] were obtained from respective author’s websites and amongst these ML -based methods were trained on the 
considered datasets in the same way as the proposed method was trained.  For each of these methods, including the  
proposed method, each dataset was divided for training and testing subsets randomly in the ratio of 80%:20% and 
50%:50% (for section 4.6 only).  The reported results are t he median value on the 1000 independent iterations 
performed for train -test splittin g for fair analysis. For training -free methods like  NIQE [41] and IL -NIQE [42] , 1000  
trials were performed on the test set for consistency and the  corresponding  median value are considered . For 
performance evaluation of other methods  namely  BJLC [39 ], Zhou [ 47], Golestaneh [22], Zhan [23], Zhu [24], Ferzli 
[9], EZM GM [15], Bahrami [13 ], and H . Liu [16 ] their results were taken either from corresponding origin al papers  
or most relevant related articles.  Since, Golestaneh [22 ], Zha n [23], Zhu [24 ] methods were developed for JPEG 
distortion, whereas Ferzli  [9], EZMG M [15], Bahrami [13 ] were  designed for  GBLUR type of distortions, hence the 
scores for these methods will be reported for corresponding specific distortion type  only. For method proposed by 
Zhou [ 47], scores are reported only on MDID2013 [ 46] and LIVEMD  [56] as the original paper mentions results only 
on these two databases.    
The experimental results for combined datasets LIVE  [52], CSIQ  [5] and TID2013  [40] containing all images exposed 
to GBLUR, JPEG and WN type of distortions are shown in Table 2.  The results of the best two performing methods 
highlighted using bold face shows that the proposed method gives consistently good results compared with other sta te-
of-art methods.  Tables 3 and 4  represent  prediction monotonicity and prediction accuracy respectively for individually 
distorted datasets containing  images exposed to GBLUR, JPEG and WN type of distortions corresponding to  each of

licens e https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by -nc-nd/4.0/  for all databases, the proposed method is  always among the best two performing  methods  except for JPEG compressed  
images from CSIQ [5 ] database  and WN images from TID2013 databases .  The proposed method gives consistently 
good performance  compare d to other methods and is comparable with FRIQUEE  [37] and BJLC [39 ] methods . 
Specifically, for TID2013 [40 ] much celebrated methods like BRISQUE [29 ], GMLo G [33] and NFERM [34 ] have 
significantly lower performance when PLCC  values are compared  whereas the proposed method has the best 
performance for both SROCC and PLCC  values . 
Furthermore, to test the wider validity of the proposed method, the SROCC and PLCC  values are compared with other 
methods on KADID -10k [5 5] and IBBI [16 ], [60] databases  and results are shown in Table 5 . It may be noted that 
KADID -10k database used for analysis in this work consists of images  exposed  to individual type  of distortions 
namely GBLUR,  JPEG compression  and White Noise , whereas IBBI [16], [ 60] database consists of intentionally 
blurred background images .  It can be observed from these results that our method maintains its position among best 
two methods for both the criteria (SROCC and PLCC)  and for all the three  distortions in KADID -10k database .  
However, for images from IBBI [16], [60] database,  the proposed method still outperform s majority of SoA methods 
but has slightly inferior performance comp ared to BRISQUE [29 ] and GMLoG [ 33] methods . When compared to H. 
Liu [16] method which is a quality assessment method primarily developed for IBBI  [16], [ 60] dataset , the proposed 
method has superior performance . It may be noted that results of [16 ] are quoted from the original paper itself.   
The six scatter plots for predicted and subjective  DMOS scores  on two distortions and three considered databases 
shown in Fig. 9  (a)-(f) further demonstrate the prediction accuracy of the proposed method.   It may be noted that under 
the ideal conditions, the  best functioning models should have highly linear and tightly grouped scattering patterns.  
From the scatter plots of Fig. 9, the l inear performance can be seen for both type s of distortion s in three databases , 
except for CSIQ [5 ] database with GBLUR type of distortion. The cause may be the effect of distortion on color 
component as we are considering only the gray -scale version of the image s. Furthermore, h ighly clustered points can 
be visualized for JPEG and GBLUR type of images in LIVE [ 52] and TID 2013 [40 ] databases shown in Fig.9 in 
accordance with  SROCC (0.979, 0.972 ), (0.958, 0.95 1) and PLCC (0.986, 0.971), (0.966 , 0.95 3) as listed in Table 3  
and Table 4  respectively.  The superior performance of proposed method for all performance metrics makes it a 
preferable algorithm for  accurate  quality assessment of images independently/jointly distorted with JPEG and GBLUR 
artefacts.  
4.3 Performance on Cross -Database:  
In the previous section, only database specific and distortion specific results were presented. In order to evaluate the 
performance of proposed method independent of the specific database a long with  better generalization capability, 
cross -database validation is performed  by training and testing the methods on different databases with similar 
distortions. This ensures that learnings from one database are not specific to it and can be used on different databases 
too.  
In this work, the images of the LIVE [ 52] database are used for train ing while CSIQ [5 ] and TID 2013 [40 ] were used 
for testing. This generates two cross -database combinatio ns (train -test) denoted as LIVE :CSIQ and LIVE: TID2013 
respectively and corresponding results  (SROCC and PLCC)  for each cross -dataset and for each  distortion are shown 
in Table 7 . For distortion specific methods only SROCC have been listed in Table 6 .  It can be observed that t he 
proposed method has best performance for both the distortion s across the two databases. BJLC [39 ] performs slightly 
better than the proposed method for JPEG type of distortion on LIVE:CSIQ  cross -validation for SROCC  values , 
whereas SROCC for JPEG compressed images from LIVE:TID2013  of the proposed method  shows better results. Zhu 
[24] also outperforms on JPEG type of distortion when SROCC  values are compared  for LIVE: TID2013, but the same 
is not true for LIVE:CSIQ based cross validations. For WN type of distortion also, the proposed  method mostly 
outperforms other methods, showing good correlation scores. For individua l database performance, BJLC [39 ] was 
giving consistently good performance but for cross -database validation it has significantly lower correlation scores, 
making it a highly database and training dependent mod el. Clearly, the proposed model stands apart as a highly robust 
and database independent model.  © <2021 >. This manuscript version is made available under the CC -BY-NC-ND 4. 0

In order to demonstrate that t he pro posed method can also work on images with multip le distortions,  it was also tested 
on images from  four multiply disto rted datasets LIVE MD [56], IVL MD [57], MDID2013 [ 46] and MDID [ 59] 
wherein original images were exposed to combi nation of JPEG compression,  blurriness  and white noise . The  training 
and testing procedure for ML and Non -ML based methods  was the same as described in section 4 .1. The performance  
was compared to  the state-of-art single -distortion (generic) methods BLIIND S2 [32], BRISQUE [29 ], GMLo G [33], 
NFERM [34], NIQE [41 ] and IL -NIQE [ 42] and multiple -distortion methods GWH -GLBP  [44],  Miao [45 ], and 
SISBLIM [ 46] using their source codes  (on LIVE MD, IVL MD, MDID2013 and MDID ) and results are listed in Table 
8 and 9 . For method proposed by Zhou [ 47], the scores were directly taken from original paper for LIVE MD and 
MDID2013. It is noteworthy to observe  the relatively poor performance and inability of celebrated generic methods 
to assess multiple distortions in an image. From the corr elation scores  listed in Table 8  namely SROCC and KR OCC, 
it can be analyzed that the pr oposed technique works well on all the  databases fo r the combination of multiple  
distortions except for slightly inferior per formance compared with Miao [45] and GWH -GLBP [44]  on MDID . But at 
the same time, it o utperforms Miao [45 ] when we compare the  PLCC scores . The method was also compared using

and WN. Best two performance s are marked using bold face .

method performs better than GWH -GLBP [44]  and Zhou [ 47] for mostly all the sub -sets. To study further , statistical 
analysis  (t-test) was conducted for comparison  of these methods  on LIVE MD [56] dataset . NIQE [ 41] and IL -NIQE  
[42] were excluded as they are opinion unaware learning free methods.  The numbers were used from 1 to 7 to represent 
methods NFE RM [34 ], GWH -GLBP [44], BRI SQUE [29], BLIINDS 2 [32], GMLo G [33], Miao [45 ] and proposed 
method respectively.  The symbols ‘1’, ‘_’, and ‘0’ tell that the method in row is significantly better, simil ar or worse , 
compared to metric in corresponding column  (with 95% confidence  level ). Table 10  represents the se statistical 
analysis results wherein e ach symbol in every  entry corresponds to results obtained on criteria’s PLCC, SR OCC and 
RMSE. It can be observed that the proposed method is statistically superior compared to all the benchmark techni ques 
with the exception of Miao [45 ] for RMSE criteria.  
4.5 Contribution of  different features : 
To get a clear understanding of the relationship between the featur es and subjective scores we perform ed an 
experiment on LIVE [ 52] dataset consisting of all images present in GBLUR and JPEG subsets. Each feature was 
individually trained -tested using GPR learner for 80 -20 % train -test ratio repeated over 1000 iterations  to get all the 
possible combinations . The median scores are reported in Fig. 10 , plotted separately  for JPEG and GBLUR images. 
From this plot, it can b e seen how zero -value d based features i.e. f6, f11 & f16 are highly relevant to human perception 
for GBLUR and JPEG images respectively. Similarly, as f21 and f22 are high -frequency based features hence show 
good results on JPEG compressed images. This work includes two parallel approaches one is only -DFT based and 
second is MSCN followed by DFT operation. To represent how this combination has better affinity towards 
assessment we mention the SROCC and PLCC scores for the three possible scenarios i.e. DFT, MSCN+DFT and

combination  of DF T and MSCN+DFT uniformly across all three databases LIVE [ 52], CSIQ [5 ] and TI D2013 [40 ].  
4.6 Choice of Regression model : 
To justify the use of GPR model as the mapping tool for extracted  features, we make a comparison  between the 
SROCC and PLCC scores obtained for S upport Vector Machine (SVM)  and GPR models respectively at two different 
validation ratios  (80-20 and 50 -50), as sh own in Table 12 . Clearly, GPR gives the best performance validating its 
employm ent in the model.  
4.7 Rum-time comparison : 
 In order to measure and compare the run time-complexity, the proposed method and some of the exi sting methods 
such as DIVINE [31 ], BRISQUE  [29], NFERM [34 ], GMLo G [33], FRIQUEE [37 ] and Miao [45 ] were executed on  
a computer equipped with  Intel (R) Xeon (R)  processor, CPU - 2.13 G Hz., 20 GB usable RAM and 64 -bit operating 
system  and 1 TB HDD . The ru n time measured for each algorithm is shown in Table 13. These results are for  a group 
of 100 image of different sizes chosen from LIVE database [ 52] of GBLUR  and JPEG  type distortion s (50% -50%) . 
From Table 13, it can be observed that proposed algorithm gives a moderate performance for rum -time complexity. It 
gives slightly inferior performance (time -complexity) compared to  BRISQUE  [29] and GMLo G [33] but it is superior 
to DIIVINE [31 ], NFERM [34], FRIQUEE [37 ] and Miao  [45].  However, it may be noted that although the run -time 
complexity for the  proposed  method is inferior to that of GMLo G [33] and BRISQUE [29 ] but the accuracy for the 
proposed method is higher compared to these two models. Hence, the model’s combined performance  and accuracy 
(SROCC , PLCC , KR OCC and RMSE ) along  with time -complexity makes it the most suitable algorithm for assessing 
images distorted with either blocking a rtefacts , blurriness , noise  individually or jointly.

In this wo rk, a novel approach to estimate the quality of images corrupted with blocking artefacts , blurriness , or noise 
individually or jointly . The proposed model is inspired from h uman perceptions employing the transform domain DFT 
and MSCN coefficients to get the natural scene properties most suited to HVS. The proposed model effectively and 
accurately estimates the quality of images where a combination of blurriness , blocking arti facts  and noise  are observed. 
The proposed method is  relatively  faster and highly accurate. It is a fully blind method of image quality assessment 
and is capable of estimat ing the overall quality of images distorted jointly by blockiness , blurriness  and no ise, and 
useful to estimate quality of highly JPEG /MPEG/H.26x  compressed images /videos  received  through bandlimited low-
pass channel s. This scenario is widely encountered while exchanging images through modern electronic gadgets.  In 
future, we aimed to extend this method for  VQA (video quality assessment)  for real-time quality monitoring  of HEVC 
and VVC coded video s.
