Both macroscopic Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian and microsco pic gauge-invariant kinetic equation
suggest a ﬁnite Higgs-mode generation in the second-order o ptical response of superconductors at
clean limit, whereas the previous derivations through the p ath-integral approach and Eilenberger
equation within the Matsubara formalism failed to give such generation. The crucial treatment
leading to this controversy lies at an artiﬁcial scheme that whether the external optical frequency is
taken as continuous variable or bosonic Matsubara frequenc y to handle the gap dynamics within the
Matsubara formalism. To resolve this issue, we derive theeﬀ ective action of the superconductinggap
nearTcin the presence of the vector potential through the path-int egral approach, to ﬁll the long
missing blank of the microscopic derivation of the Ginzburg -Landau Lagrangian in superconductors.
It is shown that only by taking optical frequency as continuo us variable within the Matsubara
formalism, can one achieve the fundamental Ginzburg-Landa u Lagrangian, and in particular, the
ﬁnite Ginzburg-Landau kinetic term leads to a ﬁnite Higgs-m ode generation at clean limit. To
further eliminate the confusion of the Matsubara frequency through a separate framework, we apply
the Eilenberger equation within the Keldysh formalism, whi ch is totally irrelevant to the Matsubara
space. By calculating the gap dynamics in the second-order r esponse, it is analytically proved that
the involved optical frequency is a continuous variable rat her than bosonic Matsubara frequency,
causing a ﬁnite Higgs-mode generation at clean limit.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the past few decades, the Higgs mode in the ﬁeld
of superconductivity, which describes the amplitude ﬂuc-
tuationδ|∆|of the superconducting order parameter ∆,
has attracted much attention. This collective excitation
corresponds to the radial excitation in the Mexican-hat
potential of free energy1, and hence, exhibits a gapful
energy spectrum at a long wavelength1–9. Owing to the
advanced ultrafast terahertz technique in nonlinear op-
tics, the Higgs mode has been experimentally observed
and identiﬁed as the origin of the excited superﬂuid-
density oscillation δρsin the second-order harmonic
generation10–16. The nonlinear optics in superconduc-
tors has since stimulated a lot of experimental interest
and inspired a great deal of theoretical studies.
Whereas the existing and growing experimental ob-
servations exhibit a very convincing evidence, the the-
oretical descriptions concerning the Higgs-mode excita-
tion in the literature are ﬁlled with controversies, which
are detrimental to the understanding of the related ex-
perimental ﬁndings. The central issue lies at a ques-
tion that with the conventional light-matter interactions
Hd=ˆp·eAτ0/m(current-vertex-related drive eﬀect)
andHp=e2A2τ3/(2m) (density-vertex-related pump ef-
fect) by the vector potential A17–19, whether the Higgs
mode can be optically excited at clean limit. Here,
τi=0,1,2,3denote the Pauli matrices in Nambu space.
Concerning this issue, although the early stage ofworksthroughthe Bloch10–14,20–26orLiouville27–31equa-
tion within the Anderson pseudospin picture32revealed
an excited ﬂuctuation of the order parameter by pump
eﬀectHp, a later symmetry analysis33implies that the
pumped order-parameter ﬂuctuation by density-vertex-
relatedHpis a phase ﬂuctuation rather than the claimed
amplitude one19, as the revealed correlationbetween am-
plitude (phase) mode and Hpin Ref. 33is zero(nonzero).
The path-integral approach is naturally capable of dis-
tinguishing the excitations of phase and Higgs modes by
deriving the correspondingeﬀective actions, and includes
both pump and drive eﬀects. Using this approach,Cea et
al.derived a vanishing Higgs-mode generation in second-
order response at clean limit34–36, in inconsistency with
the previous experimental understanding10–12. To ex-
plain the experimental ﬁndings, Cea et al.pointed
out34–36that the density-vertex-related pump eﬀect Hp
can excite a ﬁnite ﬂuctuation δnof charge density n,
so they speculated that the experimentally observed
superﬂuid-density oscillation δρsis attributed to charge-
density ﬂuctuation δnrather than the Higgs mode δ|∆|,
since the superﬂuid density ρs∝n|∆|2.
In the several polarization-resolved measurements
afterwards13–16, an isotropic second-order harmonic sig-
nal was timely reported and provides a ﬁrm evidence
to rule out the possible charge-density ﬂuctuation, as
the theoretically predicted response of the Higgs mode
(charge-density ﬂuctuation) is isotropic (anisotropic)34.
Since then, it is believed that the Higgs-mode generation
is zero at clean limit and one has to reply on impurity2
scattering to mediate the Higgs-mode generation31,37–41.
In this situation, to take account of the microscopic scat-
tering, Silaev applied the Eilenberger equation42within
the Matsubara formalism41,43, which solely includes the
current-vertex-related drive eﬀect Hd. He also derived
a vanishing Higgs-mode generation at clean limit, but
with impurities, a ﬁnite one to dominate overthe charge-
density ﬂuctuation is obtained. Particularly, Silaev
showed that the impurity scattering only mediate the
Higgs-mode excitation and is incapable of causing the
damping of this collective excitation41, so the increase
of the impurity density can enhance the optical signal of
Higgs mode.
Meanwhile, using a gauge-invariant kinetic equation
approach19,44,45withcompleteelectromagneticeﬀectand
microscopic scattering, Yang and Wu derived totally op-
posite results. They obtain a ﬁnite Higgs-mode gener-
ation contributed by the drive eﬀect at clean limit19,
and show that the charge-density ﬂuctuation in fact van-
ishes in the second-order response, as a consequence of
the charge conservation and forbidden second-order har-
monic current in systems with the spacial inversion sym-
metry. The revealed Higgs-mode generation at clean
limit can capture the experimental observation well19,
and in particular, a ﬁnite damping/lifetime of the Higgs-
mode excitation by impurities is also derived45, provid-
ing a possible origin for the experimentally observed
broadening of the Higgs-mode resonance signal as well
as the fast Higgs-mode damping after optical excita-
tion. This damping agrees with the analysis of Heisen-
berg equation of motion since the Higgs-mode excitation
and electron-impurity interaction are non-commutative
in Nambu space.
ThisﬁniteHiggs-modegenerationhasthereforebeenin
sharp contrast to the aforementioned vanishing one from
Eilenberger equation and path-integral approach. Actu-
ally, at clean limit, the ﬁnite Higgs-mode generation in
second-order response of superconductors is a direct con-
sequence of the Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian46. This is
because that from the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau
superconducting Lagrangian at clean limit, which was
proposed by Pekker and Varma through the symmetry
analysis and Lorentz invariance from the Landau phase-
transitiontheory6, onecandirectly revealthe equationof
motion of the Higgs mode by considering the amplitude
ﬂuctuation of the Landau order parameter. Then, a ﬁ-
nite Higgs-mode generation in the second-order response
is immediately obtained46. This directly leads to a par-
ticularly bizarre question that why both path-integral
approach47and Eilenberger equation48can recover the
Ginzburg-Landau equation but reach a zero Higgs-mode
generation.
To resolve this controversy, by re-examining the pre-
vious derivations within the path-integral approach in
Refs. 34–36 and Eilenberger equation in Ref. 41, it is
pointedoutbyYangandWu46thatboth previousderiva-
tions contain ﬂaws. Speciﬁcally, the previous works34–36
within the path-integral approach only kept the per-turbation expansion of the action up to second order,
whereas the essential coupling of the Higgs mode to the
second order of the drive eﬀect Hdemerges in the third-
orderperturbationexpansionoftheaction46. Sothiscou-
pling and hence ﬁnite second-order harmonic generation
of Higgs mode by the drive eﬀect are excessively over-
looked in Refs. 34–36. Within the Matsubara formalism,
picking up this coupling in the path-integral approach,
one can ﬁnd the exactly same amplitude-response coeﬃ-
cient as the one derived from Eilenberger equation41:

wherepn= (2n+1)πTrepresents the fermionic Matsub-
ara frequencies.
Nevertheless, in Ref. 41, the involved optical frequency
Ω is taken as bosonic Matsubara frequency iΩm, lead-
ing to a vanishing response coeﬃcient λEin Eq. (1)
strongly against the ﬁnite one from gauge-invariant ki-
netic equation19,46and Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian46.
Moreover, because of this treatment, the prefactor 1 /Ω2
in Eq. (1) causes an undeﬁned singularity at zero fre-
quency, and an unphysical discontinuity between cases
at Ω = 0 and Ω →0 emerges46. In contrast, the previ-
ous work in Ref. 46 takes Ω as continuous variable. A
ﬁnite Higgs-mode generation at clean limit in agreement
with the Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian is then derived,
and the obtained λEfrom both Eilenbergerequation and
path-integral approach becomes exactly same as the one
from gauge-invariant kinetic equation.
Actually, the Matsubara formalism is developed as
an auxiliary-function technique in the ﬁnite-temperature
Green function approach. In this framework, whether
taking the external optical frequency Ω as continuous
variable or bosonic Matsubara frequency iΩmcan not be
self-justiﬁedbymethod itself. ThetreatmentofΩas iΩm
in the calculations of conductivity and dielectric function
in normal metals50can be cross-justiﬁed by many other
methods irrelevant to Matsubara space, such as equa-
tion of motion, zero-temperature Green function, Boltz-
mann equation as well as Keldysh Green function ap-
proaches, whereas such justiﬁcation in the gap dynamics
of superconductors has not been performed in the liter-
ature so far. Physically, any treatment leading to result
strongly against the Ginzburg-Landau superconducting
Lagrangian can not be correct. Nevertheless, this justi-
ﬁcation in superconductors has been challenged, arguing
that the Ginzburg-Landau superconducting Lagrangian
is a phenomenological model near Tcand is unimportant
in microscopic studies, as the microscopic derivation of
this Lagrangianis absent in the literature. Theoretically,
this Lagrangian is a fundamental model by symmetry
analysis and Lorentz invariance as well as Landau phase-
transition theory, whereas to ﬁll the long missing blank
of the microscopic derivation, in the present work, we de-3
rivethe Lagrangianin superconductorsthroughthe basic
path-integral approach. In addition to this physical jus-
tiﬁcation, a natural and rigorous framework developed
in the literature to eliminate the confusion of the Mat-
subara frequency in superconductors is to perform the
formulation within the Keldysh formalism49, which is a
well-established systematic approach for studying non-
equilibrium properties and is totally irrelevant to Mat-
subara space. We therefore apply the Eilenberger equa-
tion within the Keldysh formalism to calculate the gap
dynamics at clean limit to cross-justify the treatment of
the external optical frequency.
Speciﬁcally, through the path-integralapproachwithin
the Matsubara formalism, we derive the eﬀective action
of superconducting gap near Tcin the presence of the
vector potential. We show that to recover the Ginzburg-
Landau kinetic term, one needs to keep the perturba-
tion expansion of the action up to the fourth order and
formulate the fourth-order correlation coeﬃcient. Par-
ticularly, during our calculation of the correlation coeﬃ-
cient, it is shown that only by taking optical frequency
as continuous variable, one can recover the ﬁnite coef-
ﬁcient in the Ginzburg-Landau kinetic term. Then, if
one considers the gap ﬂuctuation to obtain the equation
of motion of the Higgs mode from the Ginzburg-Landau
Lagrangian, it is clearly seen that the ﬁnite coeﬃcient in
the Ginzburg-Landau kinetic term directly leads to the
ﬁnite responsecoeﬃcient in the equation ofmotion ofthe
Higgs mode.
Furthermore, with the vectorpotential alone, we apply
theEilenbergerequationwithintheKeldyshformalismto
derive the equation of motion of the Higgs mode at clean
limit. It is established in the literature that the Keldysh
Green function can be written as a function of the re-
tarded and advanced ones through a general relation via
the distribution function. We prove that this relation-
shipmakestheKeldyshGreenfunctiondirectlysatisfying
the normalization condition of the Eilenberger equation.
Then, we solve the retarded Green function and distri-
bution function to obtain the Keldysh Green function.
With the derived Keldysh Green function, we obtain the
equation of motion of the Higgs mode, which is exactly
same as the one derived through Eilenberger equation
within the Matsubara formalism41. In contrast, as our
derivation is performed in the Keldysh formalism and is
irrelevanttotheMatsubaraspace,itisclearlyshownthat
the involved optical frequency in the response coeﬃcient
in the equation of motion of the Higgs mode is a con-
tinuous variable rather than the Matsubara frequency.
Particularly, with the continuous optical frequency, the
responsecoeﬃcientintheequationofmotionoftheHiggs
mode doesnotvanish, leadingto aﬁnite Higgsmode gen-
eration at clean limit.II. HAMILTONIAN
We ﬁrst present the general Bogoliubov-de Gennes
Hamiltonian of the conventional s-wave superconductors
in the presence of the electromagnetic potential17–19,51:

Here,ψ(x) = [ψ↑(x),ψ†
↓(x)]Tis the ﬁeld operator in the
Nambu space and x= (t,x) represents the space-time
vector;φandAdenote the scalar and vector potentials,
respectively; the momentum operator ˆp=−i/planckover2pi1∇and
ξˆp=ˆ p2/(2m)−µwithmbeing the eﬀective mass and
µdenoting the chemical potential. It is noted that the
scalar potential can be generally written as φ=¯φ0+
Eφ·x+δφ, where ¯φ0denotes the eﬀect of the electric
voltage;Eφ·xconcerns the drive eﬀect by electric ﬁeld;
δφis the induced scalar potential related to the long-
range Coulomb interaction (i.e., Hartree ﬁeld caused by
charge density ﬂuctuation)17,19,51.
In consideration of the phase δθ(x) and amplitude
δ|∆(x)|ﬂuctuations around the equilibrium gap ∆ 0, the
superconducting order parameter reads:
∆(x) =|∆(x)|eiδθ(x)= [∆0+δ|∆(x)|]eiδθ(x).(3)
It is established that the phase mode δθin Hamil-
tonian above can be eﬀectively removed by a unitary
transformation51–53
ψ(x)→eiτ3δθ(x)/2ψ(x), (4)
and then, one has
H=/integraldisplay
dxψ†(x)(H0+HLM)ψ(x), (5)
where the free BCS Hamiltonian H0is written as
H0=ξˆ pτ3+|∆(x)|τ1, (6)
and the light-matter interaction reads

with the gauge-invariant superconducting momentum
ps=∇δθ/2−eAand eﬀective ﬁeld µeﬀ=eφ+∂tδθ/2.
It has been revealed in the literature19,51that thanks
to the Coulomb screening, in the linear regime, at long-
wavelength limit, the induced scalar potential eδφcan-
cels the original longitudinal part e¯φ0+∂tδθ/2 in the
eﬀective ﬁeld µeﬀ=e¯φ0+eEφ·x+eδφ+∂tδθ/2, leaving
only the drive eﬀect of scalar-potential-induced electric
ﬁeldEφ. In general, the inclusion of this retained eﬀect
from scalar potential is essential to capture the optical-
electric-ﬁeldeﬀect in agauge-invariantmanner. Whereas
considering the fact that the vector potential character-
izes the Meissnereﬀect/Ginzburg-Landaukinetic term in4
additiontotheoptical-electric-ﬁeldeﬀect19,44,46,64, inthe
present work, we only focus on the electromagnetic eﬀect
from vector potential, similar to the previous works by
Ceaet al.34–36and Silaev41. The light-matter interaction
then becomes
HLM=ps·ˆp

Moreover, it has been established in the
literature1,8,9,17,19,51,54–56that the linear response
of the phase mode, as a scalar quantity, responds
to the longitudinal electromagnetic ﬁeld and hence
experiences the Coulomb screening. The resonance
pole of this response is then eﬀectively lifted from the
original gapless spectrum up to the high-energy plasma
frequencyωpas a consequence of the Anderson-Higgs
mechanism57, and hence, no eﬀective linear response of
the phase mode occurs at frequency Ω ≪ωp. Because of
this eﬀect, the linear response of the phase mode cancels
the unphysical longitudinal vector potential in ps, and
the superconducting momentum that appears in the
previous theoretical descriptions in the literature only
involves the physical transverse vector potential. The
light-matter interaction in Eq. (8) then consists of the
drive eﬀect Hdand pump one Hp
III. DERIVATION OF GINZBURG-LANDAU
LAGRANGIAN
In this section, we present the derivations of the time-
dependent Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian and its non-
equilibrium variation (equation of motion of the Higgs
mode). Speciﬁcally, the action of superconductors in
the presence of vector potential after the Hubbard-
Stratonovich transformation is written as17,47,55,56

Since the Green function only consists of the τ0andτ3

ishes due to the particle-hole symmetry, and the forth-
order correlation coeﬃcient χ1010=χ0110+χ1100(refer
to Appendix). Then, one ﬁnds an embryonic form of the

which is exactly same as the one obtained by Pekker and
Varma through symmetry analysis and Lorentz invari-
ance from the general Ginzburg-Landau free energy6as
it should be. Moreover, the parameters αp[Eq. (23)] and
βp[Eq.(25)] aswellas λp[Eq.(26)] hereareexactlysame
as the obtained Landau parameters in the previous work
by Gorkov18in which the Ginzburg-Landau equation is
derived from Gorkov equation.
It is noted that in the derivation of the gap dynam-
ics within the Matsubara formalism in the present work,
we take the optical frequency Ω as continuous variable
rather than bosonic Matsubara frequency iΩm, and only
with continuous Ω in this circumstance, can one re-
cover the Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian as demonstrated
above. Actually, as seen from Eq. (22), if Ω is taken as
iΩm= 2miπT, diﬀerent irrational response coeﬃcients
are obtained at cases with odd and even m. For oddm, a divergent pole (2 n+1 =mandη=−1) which is
unable to circumvent emerges in the formulation of the
ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (22). As for even
m, throughthe frequency displacement in the Matsubara
frequencysummation, theresponsecoeﬃcient λpdirectly
vanishes for nonzero m, but due to the prefactor 1 /Ω2in
Eq. (22), there exists an undeﬁned singularity at zero
frequency. Then, an unphysical discontinuity between
Ω = 0 and Ω →0 emerges. The diﬀerence between cases
with odd and even min bosonic Matsubara frequency
iΩm= 2miπTis totally unreasonable within the Mat-
subara formalism, and neither of them can recover the
ﬁnite Landau parameter at low frequency. Clearly, any
treatment that leads to consequence strongly against the
fundamental model ofsymmetry analysisand Lorentzin-
variance as well as Landau phase-transition theory can
not be correct. All of the irrationalities here simply sug-
gest that the treatment of taking Ω as iΩmcan not be
correct in the derivation of gap dynamics in supercon-
ductors.
Furthermore, from the Lagrangian above, with the
equilibrium gap ∆ 0=/radicalbig
−αp/βp, by considering the gap
ﬂuctuation δ|∆|through|∆|= ∆0+δ|∆|, its equation of
motion at long-wavelength limit is directly obtained:

Then, one immediately ﬁnds the Higgs-mode energy
spectrum (i.e., resonance pole) ωH= 2∆0on the left-
hand side of the equation above, and in particular, a
ﬁnite second-order response of Higgs mode at clean limit
ontheright-handsideoftheequationabove. Itispointed
out that although the derivation of the equation of mo-
tion ofthe Higgsmode here is basedon the small gapand
only holds near Tc, the serious derivation in regime ex-
tending toT= 0 through three diﬀerent microscopic ap-
proaches including the gauge-invariant kinetic equation,
Eilenberger equation as well as path-integral approach
also obtains the similar equation of motion as a conse-
quence of the renormalization group (scaling) theory or
basic local Abelian U(1) model (complex scalarﬁeld cou-
pled to an electromagnetic potential) in the ﬁeld theory.
IV. DERIVATION OF HIGGS-MODE
RESPONSE THROUGH EILENBERGER
EQUATION
To eliminate the confusion of the Matsubara frequency
from a separate framework in addition to the physical
justiﬁcation above, in this section, we perform the for-
mulation of the gap dynamics within the Keldysh for-
malism, which is totally irrelevant to Matsubara space.
Speciﬁcally, we apply the Eilenberger equation within
the Keldysh formalism to derive the second-order optical
response of the Higgs mode at clean limit. The Eilen-
berger equation42,58is derived from the basic Gorkov6
equation of τ3-Green function through the quasiclassical
approximation49:

Here,R= (x+x′)/2 represents the center-of-mass spa-

The Eilenberger equation within the Keldysh formal-
ism at clean limit reads42,58:
i{τ3∂t,ˆg}t−[(∆0+δ|∆|)τ1τ3,ˆg]t+[eA·vFτ3,ˆg]t=0,(33)
where the green function matrices ˆ gis deﬁned as

. (34)
Here, the operators [X,ˆg]t=X(t1)ˆg(t1,t2)−ˆg(t1,t2)X(t2)
and{X,ˆg}t=X(t1)ˆg(t1,t2)+ ˆg(t1,t2)X(t2).
Moreover, to guarantee the unique solution, the Eilen-
berger equation must be supplemented by the normaliza-
tion condition42,58:
ˆg◦ˆg= 1, (35)
where the operator ◦is deﬁned by relation A◦B=/integraltext
dtA(t1,t)B(t,t2).
The corresponding gap equation is written as
∆0+δ|∆|=−iUTr[∝an}bracketle{tgK
R,kF(t,t)∝an}bracketri}htFτ2/2],(36)
with∝an}bracketle{t...∝an}bracketri}htFdenoting the angular average over the Fermi
surface.
Considering an external optical ﬁeld with A(t) =
A0e−iΩt, by self-consistently solving Eqs. (33)-(36), one
can formulate the Higgs-mode generation at clean limit.
Speciﬁcally, in this circumstance, one can expand the
quasiclassical Green function matrices as
ˆg= ˆg(0)+δˆg(1)+δˆg(2), (37)
with them-th order response δˆg(m)on the initial state
ˆg(0). Correspondingly,theHiggs-modegeneration δ|∆|=
δ|∆|(1)e−iΩt+δ|∆|(2)e−2iΩtfrom Eq. (36) with δ|∆|(1)
andδ|∆|(2)being the excitations in ﬁrst- and second-
order optical responses, respectively. Particularly, the
ﬁrst-order response of Keldysh Green function must be
anisotropic in momentum space, leading to a vanishing
δ|∆|(1)after the angular average over the Fermi surface
in the gap equation. We then directly take δ|∆|(1)= 0
for convenience.
Consequently, the Eilenberger equation in Eq. (33) be-
comes a chain of equations:
{τ3∂t,δˆg(1)}t+[∆0τ2,δˆg(1)]t−i[eA·vFτ3,ˆg(0)]t=0,(38){τ3∂t,δˆg(2)}t+[∆0τ2,δˆg(2)]t−i[eA·vFτ3,δˆg(1)]t
+[δ|∆|(2)e−2iΩtτ2,ˆg(0)]t=0, (39)
and one can solve δˆg(1)andδˆg(2)in sequence with the
given initial state ˆ g(0). Then, with the obtained solution
ofthe Keldysh Green function, one can further derive the
response of the Higgs mode from the gap equation.
A. Solution of retarded Green function
In this part, we ﬁrst solvethe retardedGreen functions
fromEq.(33). FromtheexpansionofGreenfunction ma-
trices in Eq. (37), the retarded Green function is written
as
gR(t,t′) =gR(0)(t,t′)+δgR(1)(t,t′)+δgR(2)(t,t′)
=/integraldisplaydE
2πeiE(t′−t)[gR(0)(E)+δgR(1)(E)e−iΩt

The initial state of the retarded Green function has been
establishedintheliteraturefromGorkovequation18,41,58,

By deﬁning E1=E+ Ω andE2=E+ 2Ω, from
Eq. (38), the equation ofthe ﬁrst orderofretarded Green
function is written as
(E1τ3+i∆0τ2)δgR(1)(E)−δgR(1)(E)(Eτ3+i∆0τ2)
=eA0·vFΠR(0)

from which one ﬁnds the ﬁrst-ordersolution (refer to Ap-
pendix B):
δgR(1)(E) = (eA0·vF)τ3−gR(0)(E1)τ3gR(0)(E)
SR(E1)+SR(E).(43)
Here, ΠR(i)
3=gR(i)(E1)τ3−τ3gR(i)(E). Similarly, the
equation of the second order of retarded Green function
from Eq. (39) reads
(E2τ3+i∆0τ2)δgR(2)(E)−δgR(2)(E)(Eτ3+i∆0τ2)
=eA0·vFΠR(1)
3+iδ|∆|(2)[gR(0)(E2)τ2−τ2gR(0)(E)],(44)
and gives the second-order solution (refer to Ap-

.(45)7
Considering the response expansions, the normaliza-
tion condition [Eq. (35)] for the retarded Green function
is written as
[gR(0)(E)]2= 1, (46)
gR(0)(E1)δgR(1)(E)+δgR(1)(E)gR(0)(E) = 0,(47)
gR(0)(E2)δgR(2)(E)+δgR(2)(E)gR(0)(E)
+δgR(1)(E1)δgR(1)(E) = 0. (48)
The initial-state gR(0)(E) in Eq. (41) naturally satisﬁes
Eq. (46). Facilitated with Eq. (46), correspondingly sub-
stituting the solutions in Eqs. (43) and (45), one can eas-
ily demonstratethe normalizationconditions in Eqs. (47)
and(48). Therefore, asthe self-consistentcrosscheck,the
obtained solutions of the retarded Green function satisfy
the normalization condition.
Further substituting Eq. (41) into Eqs. (42) and (44),
the speciﬁc solution of the τ2component of δgR(2)(E) is
given by (refer to Appendix B)

with Γ(2)(E) = 2SR(E2)SR(E)[SR(E2)+SR(E)].
It is noted that the involved external optical frequency
in theτ2component of the second order of the retarded
Green function in Eq. (49) is a continuous variable. To
further consider the gap dynamics at nonzero temper-
ature and eliminate the confusion of the auxiliary Mat-
subarafrequency, wenextderivetheKeldyshGreenfunc-
tion.
B. Solution of Keldysh Green function
In thispart, wederivethe KeldyshGreenfunction. We
start with the normalization condition [Eq. (35)] for the
Keldysh Green function:
gR◦gK+gK◦gA= 0. (50)
It is established that the Keldysh Green function can be
written as a function of the retarded and advanced ones
through a general relation49,58:
gK=gR◦h−h◦gA, (51)
whereh(t,t′) denotes the distribution function. Substi-
tuting Eq. (51) to Eq. (50), one ﬁnds that the normaliza-
tion condition for the Keldysh Green function is immedi-
ately satisﬁed. Consequently, with the obtained retarded
and hence advanced Green function in Sec. IVA, to solve
the Keldysh Green function, one only needs to solve the
distribution function.
In the previous work to derive the Ginzburg-Landau
equation from Eilenberger equation within the Keldyshformalism48, the distribution function h(t,t′) is directly
takenastheequilibriumone/integraltextdE
2πh(E)e−iE(t−t′)with the
Fourier component written as
h(E) = tanh/parenleftBigβE
2/parenrightBig
. (52)
This treatment usually concerns the case near equilib-
rium or in strongly-interacting systems as applied in
the transport theory of normal and superconducting
metals49, and has also been widely used in previous stud-
ies through the Eilenberger equation58,59and diﬀusive
Usadel one60,61. In the present work, at clean limit, with
a weak external excitation, we demonstrate Eq. (52) by
seriously taking account of the distribution function.
Speciﬁcally, from the expansion of Green function ma-
trices in Eq. (37), the Keldysh Green function reads
gK(t,t′) =/integraldisplaydE
2πeiE(t′−t)[gK(0)(E)+δgK(1)(E)e−iΩt
+δgK(2)(E)e−2iΩt], (53)
and with the general relation in Eq. (51), one has
gK(0)(E)=gR(0)(E)h(0)(E)−h(0)(E)gA(0)(E),(54)
δgK(1)(E)=gR(0)(E1)δh(1)(E)+δgR(1)(E)h(0)(E)
−h(0)(E1)δgA(1)(E)−δh(1)(E)gA(0)(E),(55)
δgK(2)(E)=δgR(1)(E1)δh(1)(E)−δh(1)(E1)δgA(1)(E)
+gR(0)(E2)δh(2)(E)+δgR(2)(E)h(0)(E)
−h(0)(E2)δgA(2)(E)−δh(2)(E)gA(0)(E).(56)
Here,δh(1)(E) andδh(2)(E) stand for the ﬁrst- and
second-order responses on the initial-state h(0)(E), re-
spectively.
Accordingto Eq.(33), the KeldyshGreenfunction sat-
isﬁes the same equation as the retarded/advanced one.
Consequently, by correspondingly replacing gR(0)and
δgR(1)bygK(0)andδgK(1)in Eq. (42) and then substi-
tuting Eq. (55), one ﬁnds the equation of the ﬁrst-order
distribution function (refer to Appendix C):
(E1τ3+i∆0τ2)[gR(0)(E1)δh(1)(E)−δh(1)(E)gA(0)(E)]
−[gR(0)(E1)δh(1)(E)−δh(1)(E)gA(0)(E)](Eτ3+i∆0τ2)
=eA0·vF[h(0)(E1)−h(0)(E)][gR(0)(E1)τ3−τ3gA(0)(E)].
(57)
From above equation, the solution of the ﬁrst-order dis-
tribution function reads (refer to Appendix C)
δh(1)(E) =eA0·vFh(0)(E1)−h(0)(E)
E2
1−E2[(E1τ3+i∆0τ2)τ3
+τ3(Eτ3+i∆0τ2)]
=eA0·vFh(0)(E+Ω)−h(0)(E)
Ω. (58)
Similarly, by correspondingly replacing gR(0)and
δgR(i=1,2)bygK(0)andδgK(i=1,2)in Eq. (44), with8
Eqs. (55) and (56) as well as the help of Eq. (58), the
equation of the second-order distribution function reads
(refer to Appendix C)
(E2τ3+i∆0τ2)[gR(0)(E2)δh(2)(E)−δh(2)(E)gA(0)(E)]
−[gR(0)(E2)δh(2)(E)−δh(2)(E)gA(0)(E)](Eτ3+i∆0τ2)
=eA0·vF[gR(0)(E2)τ3−τ3gA(0)(E)][δh(1)(E1)−δh(1)(E)]
+iδ|∆|(2)[h(0)(E2)−h(0)(E)][gR(0)(E2)τ2−τ2gA(0)(E)],
(59)
from which the solution of the second-order distribution
function is obtained as (refer to Appendix C)
δh(2)(E) = (eA0·vF)δh(1)(E1)−δh(1)(E)
2Ω
−δ|∆|(2)∆0
E+Ωh(0)(E2)−h(0)(E)
2Ω.(60)
Then, both the ﬁrst- and second-order distribution func-
tions are diagonal as they should be.
The initial-state distribution function can be obtained
from the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) in self-consistent con-
sideration of the Higgs mode and vector potential, and is
written as

ing state62, with the weak excitation, at low frequency
(Ω< E=Ek), with Eqs. (58) and (60)-(61), the total
distribution function in relative-frequency space reads
h(E) =h(0)(E)+e−iΩtδh(1)(E)+e−2iΩtδh(2)(E)

Then, the driveeﬀect of vectorpotential and Higgs-mode
part in the initial-state distribution are exactly canceled
by the ﬁrst- and second-order distribution functions,
leading to the widely applied distribution function
[Eq. (52)] in the literature.
C. Higgs-mode generation
In this part, with the obtained distribution function in
Eq. (52) and the second-orderretarded Green function in
Eq. (49), from the gap equation [Eq. (36)], the second-
order optical response of the Higgs mode at clean limit
is determined by

It is noted that both amplitude-correlation coeﬃcient
βE[Eq. (65)] and response one λE[Eq. (66)] derived
here are exactly same as the ones obtained in the previ-
ouswork41bySilaevthroughEilenbergerequationwithin
Matsubara formalism. However, in Eqs. (65) and (66),
the fermionic Matsubara frequencies ipnarise from the
singularities in the distribution function h(E) during the
standard contour integral in the complex plane, whereas9
the involved external optical frequency Ω within the
Keldysh formalism is always a continuous variable, in
contrast to the treatment of taking optical frequency as
bosonic Matsubara frequency in Ref. 41. As mentioned
in the introduction, the treatment of taking optical fre-
quency as bosonic Matsubara frequency leads to the van-
ishing response coeﬃcient λE(i.e., zero Higgs-mode gen-
eration) at all Ω ∝ne}ationslash= 0, strongly against the Ginzburg-
Landau Lagrangian, whereas the prefactor 1 /Ω2inλE
causes an undeﬁned singularity at zero frequency, and
hence, an unphysical discontinuity between cases at Ω =
0 and Ω →0. Actually, even for Ω ∝ne}ationslash= 0, from Eqs. (65)-
(66), nearTcwith a weak gap, one has

.(68)
In thiscircumstance, as βE=λE/2, the Higgs-modegen-
erationδ|∆|(2), proportionalto λE/βEfrom the equation
of motion in Eq. (64), becomes undeﬁned at Matsubara
frequencyiΩmwhich leads to λE=βE= 0. This di-
rectly poses a sharp challenge to the study in Ref. 41.
Thederivationinthepresentstudy, whichisperformed
in the Keldysh formalism and totally irrelevant to Mat-
subara space, naturally and analytically proves the con-
tinuous variable of the optical frequency in this situa-
tion. With the continuous optical frequency, near Tc,
from Eqs. (67)-(68), one ﬁnds a ﬁnite Higgs-mode gener-
ation at all Ω:

, (70)
implying a ﬁnite Higgs-mode generation at clean case.
It is also noted that although the Eilenberger equation
with the continuous optical frequency can recover the
ﬁnite Higgs-mode generation at clean limit revealed
by Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian and gauge-invariant
kinetic equation19,46, this approach fails to derive the
Higgs-mode damping by impurity scattering due to the
generically incomplete scattering integral41. As proved
in Ref. 63, becauseofthe quasiclassicalapproximationon
τ3-Green function, the scattering integral in Eilenberger
equation only involves the anisotropic part of the Greenfunction that is related to the transport property, but
generically drops out the isotropic one which determines
the Higgs-mode lifetime. In this circumstance, the
path-integral approach64and gauge-invariant kinetic
equation45provide eﬃcient and separate approaches to
derive the induced damping of the Higgs mode by impu-
rities, which agrees with the analysis through Heisenberg
equation of motion as mentioned in the introduction
and provides a possible origin for the experimentally ob-
served broadening of the Higgs-mode resonance signal as
wellasthefastHiggs-modedampingafterexcitation45,64.
V. SUMMARY
In summary, we have resolved the current controversy
in the literature that why the previous derivations at
clean limit through the path-integral approach34–36and
Eilenberger equation41within the Matsubara formalism
failed to reach the Higgs-mode generation revealed by
Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian46and gauge-invariant ki-
netic equation19,46. The crucial treatment leading to
this controversy lies at an artiﬁcial scheme within the
Matsubara formalism that whether the involved external
optical frequency Ω in the gap dynamics is taken as con-
tinuous variable or bosonic Matsubara frequency iΩm.
To resolve this confusion, we derive the eﬀective action
of superconducting gap near Tcin the presence of the
vector potential through the path-integral approach, and
show that only by taking Ω as continuous variable within
Matsubara formalism, one can achieve the fundamental
Ginzburg-Landau superconducting Lagrangian in agree-
ment with Landau phase-transition theory and symme-
try analysis. In addition to this physical justiﬁcation, we
also perform the formulation of the gap dynamics within
a separate and rigorous framework—Keldysh formalism,
which is totally irrelevant to Matsubara space. By ap-
plying the Eilenberger equation in Keldysh space to cal-
culate the second-order response of the Higgs mode, it is
analytically proved that the involved optical frequency is
always a continuous variable, leading to ﬁnite response
coeﬃcient at clean limit.
Consequently, the present study conﬁrms the uni-
ﬁed conclusion, i.e., a ﬁnite Higgs-mode generation at
clean limit in the second-order response of supercon-
ductors from three diﬀerent microscopic approaches (in-
cluding the gauge-invariant kinetic equation, Eilenberger
equation and path-integral approach) as well as from
Ginzburg-LandauLagrangian,andcanthereforehelpun-
derstanding the experimental ﬁndings of the observed
Higgs-mode excitation10–16.

Appendix B: Derivation of retarded Green function from Eile nberger equation
In this part, we present the derivation of the retarded Green fun ction from the Eilenberger equation. With the
initial state of the retarded Green function in Eq. (41), the equat ion of the ﬁrst order of retarded Green function in
Eq. (42) is re-written as
SR(E1)gR(0)(E1)δgR(1)(E)−δgR(1)(E)SR(E)gR(0)(E) =eA0·vFΠR(0)
3. (B1)
From above equation, considering the normalization condition of gR(0)(E) in Eq. (46), one has
[SR(E1)]2δgR(1)(E)−SR(E1)SR(E)gR(0)(E1)δgR(1)(E)gR(0)(E) =SR(E1)eA0·vF[τ3−gR(0)(E1)τ3gR(0)(E)],(B2)
SR(E)SR(E1)gR(0)(E1)δgR(1)(E)gR(0)(E)−[SR(E)]2δgR(1)(E) =SR(E)eA0·vF[gR(0)(E1)τ3gR(0)(E)−τ3].(B3)
Then, the solution of δgR(1)(E) in Eq. (43) can be easily obtained by adding Eqs. (B2) and (B3). Mor eover, substi-
tuting Eq. (41) into Eq. (43), the speciﬁc expression of δgR(1)(E) is given by
δgR(1)(E) = (eA0·vF)τ3−[SR(E1)SR(E)]−1[E1Eτ3+i∆0(E0+E1)τ2+∆2
0τ3]
SR(E1)+SR(E). (B4)
Similarly, the equation of the second order of retarded Green func tion in Eq. (44) is re-written as
SR(E2)gR(0)(E2)δgR(2)(E)−δgR(2)(E)SR(E)gR(0)(E) =eA0·vFΠR(1)
3+iδ|∆|(2)[gR(0)(E2)τ2−τ2gR(0)(E)],(B5)
and using the normalization condition of gR(0)(E) in Eq. (46), one easily gets the solution of δgR(1)(E) in Eq. (45).
Substituting Eqs. (41) and (B4) into Eq. (45), the speciﬁc expres sion of the τ2component of δgR(2)(E) reads

Appendix C: Derivation of distribution function from Eilen berger equation
In this part, we present the derivation of the distribution function from the Eilenberger equation. As mentioned
in Sec. IVB, according to Eq. (33), the Keldysh Green function sat isﬁes the same equation as the retarded/advanced
one. Therefore, the equation of the ﬁrst order of the Keldysh Gr een function reads
(E1τ3+i∆0τ2)δgK(1)(E)−δgK(1)(E)(Eτ3+i∆0τ2) =eA0·vFΠK(0)
3. (C1)
Substituting gK(0)[Eq. (54)] and δgK(1)(E) [Eq. (55)], the above equation becomes
(E1τ3+i∆0τ2)[gR(0)(E1)δh(1)(E)−δh(1)(E)gA(0)(E)]−[gR(0)(E1)δh(1)(E)−δh(1)(E)gA(0)(E)](Eτ3+i∆0τ2)=h(0)(E)
×[δgR(1)(E)(Eτ3+i∆0τ2)−(E1τ3+i∆0τ2)δgR(1)(E)]−h(0)(E1)[δgA(1)(E)(Eτ3+i∆0τ2)−(E1τ3+i∆0τ2)δgA(1)(E)]

Then, facilitated with the equations of the ﬁrst order of the retar ded [Eq. (42)] and advanced Green functions, one
arrives at the equation of the ﬁrst order of the distribution funct ion in Eq. (57). By ﬁrst multiplying Eq. (57) by
(E1τ3+i∆0τ2) from the left side and ( Eτ3+i∆0τ2) from the right side respectively and adding the obtained two
equations afterwards, one has
[(E2
1+∆2
0)−(E2+∆2

,(C3)
from which the solution of the ﬁrst order of the distribution functio n reads

(E2

and then, Eq. (58) is derived.
Similarly, the equation of the second order of the Keldysh Green fun ction reads
(E2τ3+i∆0τ2)δgK(2)(E)−δgK(2)(E)(Eτ3+i∆0τ2) =eA0·vFΠK(1)
3+iδ|∆|(2)[gK(0)(E2)τ2−τ2gK(0)(E)].(C5)
Substituting gK(0)[Eq. (54)] and δgK(1)(E) [Eq. (55)] as well as δgK(2)(E) [Eq. (56)], the above equation becomes
(E2τ3+i∆0τ2)[gR(0)(E2)δh(2)(E)−δh(2)(E)gA(0)(E)]−[gR(0)(E2)δh(2)(E)−δh(2)(E)gA(0)(E)](Eτ3+i∆0τ2)

Facilitated with the equations of the second order of the retarded [Eq. (44)] and advanced Green functions, one has
(E2τ3+i∆0τ2)[gR(0)(E2)δh(2)(E)−δh(2)(E)gA(0)(E)]−[gR(0)(E2)δh(2)(E)−δh(2)(E)gA(0)(E)](Eτ3+i∆0τ2)
= [δgR(1)(E1)δh(1)(E)−δh(1)(E1)δgA(1)(E)](Eτ3+i∆0τ2)−(E2τ3+i∆0τ2)[δgR(1)(E1)δh(1)(E)−δh(1)(E1)δgA(1)(E)]

+iδ|∆|(2)[h(0)(E2)−h(0)(E)][gR(0)(E2)τ2−τ2gA(0)(E)]. (C7)
Further using Eq. (58) to replace eA0·vF[h(0)(E1)−h(0)(E)] with Ωδh1(E), the above equation is simpliﬁed as
(E2τ3+i∆0τ2)[gR(0)(E2)δh(2)(E)−δh(2)(E)gA(0)(E)]−[gR(0)(E2)δh(2)(E)−δh(2)(E)gA(0)(E)](Eτ3+i∆0τ2)
=δh(1)(E)[δgR(1)(E1)(E1τ3+i∆0τ2)−(E2τ3+i∆0τ2)δgR(1)(E1)−eA0·vFτ3gR(0)(E1)]
−δh(1)(E1)[δgA(1)(E1)(E1τ3+i∆0τ2)−(E2τ3+i∆0τ2)δgA(1)(E1)+eA0·vFgA(0)(E1)τ3]

Consequently, substituting equations of the ﬁrst order of the re tarded [Eq. (42)] and advanced Green functions to
above equation, one arrives at the equation of the second order o f the distribution function in Eq. (59). By ﬁrst
multiplying Eq. (57) by ( E2τ3+i∆0τ2) from the left side and ( Eτ3+i∆0τ2) from the right side respectively and
adding the obtained two equations afterwards, one has

also performed the diagrammatic formulation. Neverthe-
less, as referred to Sec. IV A in Ref. 41, a special proce-
dure that follows the exact step to derive the Eilenberger
equation by ﬁrst taking the commutation between the
self-energy and τ3-Green function and applying the quasi-classical approximation afterwards, was applied to handle
the calculation within the diagrammatic formalism. Con-
sequently, the applied diagrammatic formalism approach
with this procedure becomes exactly same as the Eilen-
berger equation and is not aseparate nontrivial techinique .
