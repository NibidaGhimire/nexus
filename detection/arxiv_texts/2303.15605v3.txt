Abstract
We introduce the class of permawound unipotent groups, and s how that they si-
multaneously satisfy certain “ubiquity” and “rigidity” pr operties that in combination
render them very useful in the study of general wound unipote nt groups. As an illus-
tration of their utility, we present two applications: We pr ove that nonsplit smooth
unipotent groups over (inﬁnite) ﬁelds ﬁnitely-generated o verFphave inﬁnite ﬁrst co-
homology; and we show that every commutative p-torsion wound unipotent group over
a ﬁeld of degree of imperfection 1is the maximal unipotent quotient of a commutative
pseudo-reductive group, thus partially answering a questi on of Totaro.

1 Introduction
Unipotent groups play a fundamental role in the theory of lin ear algebraic groups. To
illustrate this, recall that, given a connected linear alge braic group Gover a ﬁeld k, the
k-unipotent radical RU,k(G)ofGis deﬁned to be its maximal smooth connected normal
unipotentk-subgroup. That there exists a unique such maximal k-subgroup is a well-known
fact in the theory of linear algebraic groups; see [Bor, Ch.IV , §11.21]. We say that Gisk-
pseudo-reductive , or just pseudo-reductive when kis clear from context, when RU,k(G) = 1
– that is,Gcontains no nontrivial smooth connected normal unipotent s ubgroups over k.
Then the quotient P:=G/Ru,kG)is pseudo-reductive, and in this manner one may write
Gas an extension of a pseudo-reductive group by a smooth conne cted unipotent group.
In [CGP], a classiﬁcation of pseudo-reductive groups is giv en, up to the commutative case.
That is, all such groups are described explicitly (the class iﬁcation is somewhat less explicit
in characteristic 2when[k:k2]>2), up to a commutative pseudo-reductive group. This
leaves one to study unipotent groups. Furthermore, one can s ay little in general about
commutative pseudo-reductive groups, and unipotent group s arise naturally in the study
of such groups as well, as the quotients of such groups by thei r maximal tori. (More about
this later.)
Another manner in which unipotent groups arise naturally in the study of general (even
pseudo-reductive) groups is via the so-called open cell dec omposition associated to a cochar-
acter. To deﬁne these open cells, we need to review some “dyna mic constructions”. Fix a
cocharacter β:Gm→G(possibly trivial). Then we deﬁne a subfunctor UG(β)⊂Gby the
formula
UG(β)(R) :={g∈G(R)|lim
t→0β(t)gβ(t)−1= 1}
fork-algebrasR. Let us explain what we mean by this. The map (Gm)R→GRdeﬁned by
t/mapsto→β(t)gβ(t)−1may or may not extend to a map cβ:A1
R→GR. If it does, then it extends
uniquely, since GRis separated over R. Then we deﬁne limt→0β(t)gβ(t)−1:=cβ(0).
The subfunctor UG(β)⊂Gis represented by a split smooth connected unipotent k-
subgroup scheme of G(which we also denote by UG(β)) [CGP, Lemma 2.1.5, Prop.2.1.10].
LetZG(β)denote the (scheme-theoretic) centralizer in Gofβ(Gm). Then the multiplication
map
mG:UG(β−1)×ZG(β)×UG(β)→G (1.1)
is an open immersion [CGP, Prop.2.1.8(3)]. The image of this map is called the open
cellinGassociated to β, or the open cell of the pair (G,β). For a generically chosen β,
2ZG(β) =ZG(T)for a maximal k-torusT. This open cell is a very useful tool for studying
the groupG. The mysterious part of the open cell is the quotient ZG(T)/T, which is a
unipotent group.
Among unipotent groups, there is a collection of particular ly simple ones: namely, those
that are split. Recall that a smooth connected unipotent gro upUis said to be k-split (or
just split when kis clear from the context) if it admits a k-group scheme ﬁltration overk
1 =U0/triangleleftequalU1/triangleleftequal···/triangleleftequalUn=U
withUi+1/Ui≃Gafor0≤i<n.
In general, for a smooth connected unipotent k-groupU, there is a maximal split unipo-
tentk-subgroupUsplit⊂U, and this subgroup is normal in U[CGP, Th.B.3.4]. The quo-
tient then does not contain a copy of Ga. These are the more mysterious unipotent groups,
and they have a name. As introduced by Jacques Tits [Tit] (of w hose work [CGP, App.B]
is an exposition), a smooth connected unipotent k-groupUis said to be k-wound (or just
wound when kis clear from the context) if any k-morphism A1
k→Ufrom the aﬃne line
toUis the constant morphism to a k-point ofU[CGP, Def.B.2.1]. This is (non-obviously)
equivalent to requiring that there be no non-constant k-homomorphism Ga→U. Indeed,
this property follows from woundness because Ga≃A1ask-schemes, and conversely, it
also implies woundness by [CGP, Prop.B.3.2]. Woundness is al so equivalent to requiring
thatUnot contain a k-subgroup scheme k-isomorphic to Ga, as once again follows from
[CGP, Prop.B.3.2].
Woundness, which may be viewed as the analogue for unipotent groups of anisotropicity
for tori (while splitness for unipotent groups is the analog ue of splitness for tori), never-
theless behaves in the opposite manner to anisotropicity wi th regard to ﬁeld extensions,
as we now explain. A k-torus becomes split over some ﬁnite separable extension (e quiva-
lently, every torus over a separably closed ﬁeld is split), w hile a smooth connected unipotent
group becomes split over a ﬁnite purely inseparable extension (equivalently, every smooth
connected unipotent group over a perfect ﬁeld is split) [CGP , Cor.B.2.7]. Similarly, for a
ﬁnite purely inseparable extension k′/k, ak-torus is anisotropic over kif and only if it is
so overk′, while for a (not necessarily algebraic) separable extensi onk′′/k, a smooth con-
nected unipotent k-group is wound over kif and only if it is so over k′′[CGP, Prop.B.3.2].
Because the only wound unipotent group over a perfect ﬁeld is t he trivial group, wound-
ness is only an interesting notion over imperfect ﬁelds (and in particular is uninteresting in
characteristic 0). On the other hand, wound unipotent groups exist over every imperfect
ﬁeld, as the following example shows.
Example 1.1.([CGP, Ex.B.1.1]) This example is originally due to Rosenlic ht [Rosenlicht,
p.46]. Let kbe an imperfect ﬁeld of characteristic p, leta∈k−kp, and consider the
subgroupWaofG2
a=Ga×Gadeﬁned by the following equation:
X+Xp+aYp= 0.
3One may check that the maps (X,Y)→X+a1/pY,T/mapsto→(−Tp,a−1/p(T+Tp))deﬁne
mutually inverse isomorphisms between WaandGaover the purely inseparable extension
k(a1/p). In particular, Wais smooth connected unipotent. We claim that it is wound.
One way to see this is to note that the projective closure WaofWa, deﬁned in P2
kby the
equation
XZp−1+Xp+aYp= 0,
is regular, hence is the regular completion of the aﬃne curve Wa. IfWawere not wound,
then it would contain, hence be k-isomorphic to, Ga. But the regular completion of Gais
P1
k, which has rational point at inﬁnity, while the unique point ofWa\Waonly becomes
rational over k(a1/p). (Another more general approach to seeing woundness is to us e [CGP,
Lem.B.1.7, (1) =⇒(2)].)
One may also construct non-commutative examples over every imperfect ﬁeld. See [Con,
Ex.2.10].
Woundness enjoys certain permanence properties. It is clea rly inherited by smooth
connected subgroups, and it is also inherited by extensions : an extension of wound unipotent
groups is still wound unipotent, as follows, for example, fr om the formulation in terms of
non-existence of nonzero k-homomorphisms from Ga. It is not, however, inherited by
quotients. In fact, every smooth connected unipotent k-groupUadmits an isogeny onto a
split group as follows. The group Uk1/pnis split for some n≥0(becauseUsplits over a
perfect closure of k). LetU(pn)denote then-fold Frobenius twist of Uoverk. We have the
following commutative diagram:
U(pn)Uk1/pn U
Spec(k) Spec( k1/pn) Spec( k)∼
/square /square
∼
The vertical arrows are the structure maps deﬁning the k-scheme structures on UandU(pn)
and thek1/pn-structure on Uk1/pn, the ﬁrst arrow in the bottom row is that induced by the
isomorphism k1/pn∼− →kwhich sends xtoxpn, and the second arrow is induced by the
inclusionk ֒→k1/pn. The second square is Cartesian by deﬁnition, as is the large outer
square. Therefore, so too is the ﬁrst square. This diagram sh ows that the k1/pn-splitness
ofUk1/pnimplies the k-splitness of U(pn). Therefore, the n-fold Frobenius map U→U(pn)
deﬁnes ak-isogeny from Uonto a split unipotent group. While this example involves fo rm-
ing the quotient by an inﬁnitesimal subgroup, even forming q uotients by smooth connected
subgroups does not preserve woundness in general, as we shal l see soon.
While woundness is not inherited in general by quotients, th is paper involves the study
of groups with the property that woundness isinherited when one forms quotients by them
(or more precisely, by any of theirquotients). These are the permawound groups, to be
deﬁned shortly. First, we mention the notion of semiwound unipotent groups. These are
4deﬁned by the same condition as wound groups, and satisfy man y of the same properties,
except that we do not require them to be smooth or connected. S ee appendix A and in
particular Deﬁnition A.2.
The following simple deﬁnition underlies this entire paper .
Deﬁnition 1.2. Letkbe a ﬁeld. We say that a smooth unipotent k-group scheme U
isk-permawound , or just permawound when kis clear from context, when the following
condition holds: For every right-exact sequence of ﬁnite ty pek-group schemes
U−→Eπ− −→Ga−→1,
Econtains ak-subgroup scheme k-isomorphic to Ga.
Stated diﬀerently, if Uis a quotient group of U, then semiwound groups are stable under
the formation of quotients by U.
Example 1.3.To get a feel for the meaning of the above deﬁnition, let us ret urn to the
groupWaof Example 1.1. When p >2, that group is not permawound. Indeed, in this
case, we may choose b∈kthat is not of the form xp+ayp, because [k:kp]≥p>2. Then
we consider the k-group
E:={X+aXp+Yp−bZp= 0} ⊂G3
a.
One may show that Edoes not contain a copy of Ga. Indeed, the leading part aXp+Yp−
bZphas no nontrivial zeroes, so this follows from [CGP, Lem.B.1. 7,(1) =⇒(2)]. But one
has the exact sequence
Wa−→E−→Ga−→0,
where the second map is (X,Y,Z)/mapsto→Z. ThusWadoes not satisfy the condition of Deﬁni-
tion 1.2 when p>2.
The problem in Example 1.3 was that the leading part (usually called the principal part )
of the polynomial deﬁning Wadoes not take every value in k. That is, it is not universal .
We will show later (Proposition 6.4) that a smooth group Udeﬁned by a p-polynomial
Fwhose principal Ppart has no nontrivial zeroes is permawound precisely when Pis
universal. In particular, when p= 2,Wais permawound precisely when khas degree of
imperfection 1.
Permawound groups satisfy two fundamental properties whic h make them extremely
useful in the study of general wound unipotent groups. The ﬁr st, given below, we call
ubiquity.
Theorem 1.4. (“Ubiquity” )Letkbe a ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection. Then for any
smooth commutative p-torsion semiwound unipotent k-groupU, there is an exact sequence
0−→U−→W−→V−→0
withWwound, commutative, p-torsion, and permawound, and Va vector group.
5Theorem 1.4 is not very surprising. We saw in Example 1.3 how o ne may begin with a
p-polynomial Fand simply add on a variable to obtain an extension of Gaby the group
{F= 0}described by F. The proof of Theorem 1.4 essentially entails repeating thi s process
until one obtains a p-polynomial with universal principal part. The hard part is showing
that groups deﬁned by such polynomials are indeed permawoun d (the subtlety being to
ensure that there are no semiwound extensions of Gabyquotients of such groups).
The utility of the ubiquity property is that many properties that one might wish to
prove about wound unipotent groups are inherited by subgrou ps, hence to prove them for
general wound groups – at least those that are commutative an dp-torsion – it suﬃces to
treat the case of permawound groups. In fact, using [CGP, Cor .B.3.3], if the property one
wishes to establish is also inherited by extensions (as many such properties are), then it
suﬃces to treat the p-torsion commutative case, hence the permawound case.
The reader may now wonder how this is helpful. Why should the s tudy of permawound
groups be any easier than that of general wound unipotent gro ups? The answer lies in
the second fundamental property of such groups, which we cal l rigidity. In contrast to the
ubiquity property, rigidity is rather surprising. To state it, we deﬁne for any separably
closed ﬁeld kof ﬁnite degree of imperfection a wound unipotent k-group V. The deﬁnition
may be given as follows, though a more thorough discussion wi ll be given in §7. Take any
p-basisλ1,...,λ rofk, letV⊂GI

k[Xf|f∈I]:

f∈I/parenleftBiggr/productdisplay
i=1λf(i)
i/parenrightBigg
Xp
f,
where the subscript 0denotes the constant function with value 0. The rigidity property of
permawound groups is the following statement.
Theorem 1.5. (“Rigidity” )Letkbe a separably closed ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection
r, and letUbe a wound permawound unipotent k-group scheme. Then Uadmits a ﬁltration
1 =U0/triangleleftequalU1/triangleleftequal···/triangleleftequalUm=Usuch that, for each 1≤i≤m, eitherUi/Ui−1≃Vor
Ui/Ui−1≃Rk1/p/k(αp).
In the above, αpover anFp-schemeSdenotes as usual the base change to Sof the
Fp-group scheme Fp[X]/(Xp)with group law X·Y:=X+Y, whileRk1/p/kdenotes Weil
restriction of scalars from k1/ptok. Thek-groups VandRk1/p/k(αp)appearing in Theorem
1.5 are semiwound and satisfy a property known as weak permaw oundness to be deﬁned in
§5. In fact, the former group is even wound and permawound.
Combining ubiquity and rigidity, one obtains for instance t he following: given a sepa-
rably closed ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection, and a prop erty of groups that one wishes
to prove for all wound unipotent k-groups, if the property is inherited by subgroups and
by extensions, then it suﬃces to prove it for the two groups VandRk1/p/k(αp). In fact,
permawound groups – and in particular the ubiquity and rigid ity properties – are useful
even for proving properties of wound groups over ﬁelds that m ay not be separably closed
6or of ﬁnite degree of imperfection. Indeed, the latter is har dly a condition because essen-
tially any property of wound groups that one wishes to prove m ay be easily reduced to the
ﬁnite degree of imperfection case by a simple spreading out a rgument. (For instance, any
unipotent group is deﬁned over a ﬁnitely-generated ﬁeld, as are maps between ﬁnite type
schemes over ﬁelds.) The separably closed condition is also not too restrictive for many
applications, because one can often pull properties down fr om ﬁnite separable extensions.
As a ﬁrst illustration of the utility of permawound groups – i n particular of their ubiquity
and rigidity properties – we give two applications to questi ons of independent interest. The
ﬁrst concerns the cohomology of smooth unipotent groups.
Theorem 1.6. LetKbe an inﬁnite ﬁnitely generated extension ﬁeld of Fp, and letUbe a
smooth unipotent K-group scheme that is not split. Then H1(K,U)is inﬁnite.
Note that this is a statement about unipotent groups over ﬁel ds that are not separably
closed. Nevertheless, the rigidity property plays a crucia l role in the proof of Theorem 1.6.
The second application is to a question of Totaro concerning unipotent quotients of
commutative pseudo-reductive groups. As stated earlier, i n [CGP], a classiﬁcation of
pseudo-reductive groups is given, up to the commutative cas e. That is, all such groups
are described explicitly, up to a commutative pseudo-reduc tive group, and it appears that
one can in general say little about the nature of groups of the latter type. It is therefore of
signiﬁcant interest in the general theory of linear algebra ic groups over imperfect ﬁelds to
study commutative pseudo-reductive groups.
LetCbe a commutative pseudo-reductive k-group, and let T⊂Cbe its maximal torus.
ThenU:=C/Tis a smooth connected commutative unipotent k-group. Furthermore, U
is necessarily wound. Indeed, because woundness and pseudo -reductivity are insensitive to
passage to separable extensions, we may assume that kis separably closed, and in that
case the woundness of Ufollows from the fact that Ext1(Ga,Gm) = 0 [DG, Ch.III, §6,
Cor.5.2]. We refer to Uas the maximal unipotent quotient ofC. A natural question is
which commutative wound unipotent k-groups arise as maximal unipotent quotients of
commutative pseudo-reductive k-groups. When k=k0(a,b)is a rational function ﬁeld in
two variables over an arbitrary ﬁeld k0of characteristic p, Totaro constructed a commutative
wound unipotent k-groupUthat cannot be expressed as such a quotient [Tot, Ex.9.7]. In
fact, one can show that his example works over any ﬁeld of degr ee of imperfection >1,
with the roles of aandbplayed by any pair of p-independent elements of k. Nevertheless,
for ﬁelds of degree of imperfection 1, Totaro posed the following optimistic question.
Question 1.7 ([Tot, Question 9.11]) .Ifkis a ﬁeld of degree of imperfection 1, is every
commutative wound unipotent k-group the maximal unipotent quotient of a commutative
pseudo-reductive k-group?
We will use the ubiquity and rigidity properties of permawou nd groups to prove the
following aﬃrmative answer to Totaro’s question when the gr oup in question is p-torsion.
7Theorem 1.8. Letkbe a ﬁeld of degree of imperfection 1. Then every commutative
p-torsion wound unipotent k-group is the maximal unipotent quotient of a commutative
pseudo-reductive k-group.
This paper may be roughly broken up into three parts. The ﬁrst part, consisting of §§2–
6, is concerned with characterizing those subgroups of vect or groups that are permawound,
culminating in the characterization Theorem 6.10 of such gr oups, as well as the corollary
rigidity principle (Theorem 6.12). The second part of the pa per, consisting of §§7–9, consists
of the proof of the rigidity property of permawound groups (T heorem 9.6). The third and
ﬁnal part – §§10–11 – consists of applications of permawound groups. The reader may wish
to read this part as initial motivation before the rest of the paper.

1.2 Notation and Conventions
Throughout the paper, kdenotes a ﬁeld, and, when pappears, it means that khas positive
characteristic p. The symbols kperfandksdenote perfect and separable closures of k,
respectively.
For a scheme S, we regard the category of S-group schemes as a fully faithful subcategory
of the category of fppf group sheaves on S. In particular, when we say that a sequence
ofS-group schemes is exact, or that a map of S-group schemes is surjective, et cetera, we
mean that the corresponding property of fppf sheaves holds. Furthermore, all cohomology
is in the category of fppf sheaves unless stated otherwise.
2 Subgroups of vector groups
In this section we analyze subgroups of vector groups, the ma in point being a result which
yields a ﬁltration on commutative semiwound unipotent grou ps such that each of the factor
groups may be described as a hypersurface in a vector group (P roposition 2.7). We begin by
recalling some basic notions pertaining to p-polynomials. Let kbe a ﬁeld of characteristic
p >0. Ap-polynomial is a polynomial F∈k[X1,...,X n]of the form F(X1,...,X n) :=/summationtextn
i=1/summationtextNi
j=0ci,jXpj
iwithci,j∈k. We remark that part of the data of the p-polynomial is the
polynomial ring in which it lies. So, for instance, we regard X1∈k[X1]andX1∈k[X1,X2]
as being diﬀerent p-polynomials. The reason for this is that the ﬁrst one descri bes the
trivial group {X1= 0} ⊂Ga, while the latter describes the copy of 0×GaofGasitting
8insideG2
a. The principal part ofFis thep-polynomial P(X1,...,X n) :=/summationtext
i∈Ici,niXpni
i∈
k[X1,...,X n], whereI⊂ {1,...,n}is the set of indices such that Xiappears in F, and
niis the maximal jsuch thatci,j/\e}atio\slash= 0. Note that we consider Pas lying in the same
polynomial ring as F, regardless of how many variables actually appear in F. We say that
Fisseparable when it deﬁnes a smooth k-subgroup scheme of Gn
a– equivalently, when F
has nonzero linear part. All of this is previously deﬁned ter minology; see [CGP, App.B].
Now we introduce some new terminology.
Deﬁnition 2.1. We say that a p-polynomial P∈k[X1,...,X n]ismonogeneous when each
variable appears in at most one term of P. That is, we may write P=/summationtextn
i=1ciXpni
i,
where we allow ci= 0. (Equivalently, the part involving each variable is homoge neous,
hence the name.) We say that a monogeneous p-polynomial Pisreduced when the equation
P(x1,...,x n) = 0has no solutions in kother than/vector0. We say that an arbitrary p-polynomial
Fis reduced when its principal part is.
The ﬁrst part of the following result follows from [CGP, Lem. B.1.7,(2) =⇒(3)].
Proposition 2.2. LetF∈k[X1,...,X n]be a nonzero p-polynomial. Then there exist a
k-group scheme automorphism σofGn
aand1≤m≤nsuch thatF◦σ∈k[Xm,...,X n]
is a reduced p-polynomial. If Fis monogeneous, then one may choose σso thatF◦σis
monogeneous.
Proof. Ifn= 0, thenF= 0, so assume that n >0. IfFcan be transformed by an
automorphism of Gn
a(respectively, an automorphism preserving monogeneity of Fin the
monogeneous case) to lie in k[Xi]i∈Ifor some proper subset I⊂ {1,...,n}, then we are
done by induction. So assume that every automorphism of Gn
a(resp.every automorphism
preserving monogeneity of F) transforms Finto ap-polynomial involving all of the variables
X1,...,X n. We may assume that Fis such that/summationtext
idegXi(F)is minimal among all trans-
formations of Fvia automorphisms of Gn
a(resp.automoprhisms preserving monogeneity).
Then we claim that Fis reduced.
Indeed, let Pbe the principal part of F, and assume that Padmits a nontrivial zero
(r1,...,rn)∈kn. Leti0be such that ri0/\e}atio\slash= 0and such that
pdi0:= degXi0(F) = max{pdi:= degXi(F)|ri/\e}atio\slash= 0}.
Letσdenote the following invertible change of variables on Gn
a:
Xi/mapsto→

Xi ri= 0
ri0Xi0 i=i0
Xi+riXpdi0−di
i0else.
ThenF◦σis still monogeneous if Fis, and has the same degree as FinXifor alliexcept
fori=i0, for which the degree of F◦σis strictly lower. This violates minimality, so we
conclude that Fwas already reduced.
9The proof of the proposition below amounts to an algorithm, a kin to Gaussian elim-
ination, for, given a subgroup of a vector group described by a system of p-polynomials,
describing it by a new system of equations of a relatively sim ple form.
Proposition 2.3. LetH1,...,H r∈k[X1,...,X n]bep-polynomials, and let U:=∩i{Hi=
0} ⊂Gn
abe thek-group that they deﬁne. Then there exists a k-group scheme automorphism
σofGn
a, andp-polynomials F1,...,F m∈k[X1,...,X n]such thatm≤rand
(i) For1≤i<m,Fi∈k[Xi,Xi+1,...,X n]−k[Xi+1,...,X n];
(ii) Ifm >0, then for some 0≤j≤n−m,Fm∈k[Xm+j,...,X n]is a reduced p-
polynomial (as an element of k[Xm+j,...,X n]); and
(iii)σ(U)is thek-subgroup scheme of Gn
adescribed as the vanishing locus of the Fi.
Proof. We proceed by induction on the pair (n,r)ordered lexicographically. The cases
n= 0andr= 0are trivial, so assume that n,r >0. We ﬁrst treat the case r= 1. Then
Uis described by a single p-polynomial H. IfHvanishes, then we are reduced to the case
r= 0, so assume that H/\e}atio\slash= 0. Then Proposition 2.2 implies that a change of variables
transforms Hinto a reduced p-polynomial F1on the last tcoordinates for some t≤n, so
takingm= 1,F1does the job.
Now consider the general case. If there is a family of p-polynomials describing Usuch
that none of the polynomials involve X1, thenUis just the product of the ﬁrst Gafactor
inGn
aand a subgroup of Gn−1
a, so we are done by induction. We therefore assume that
every family of p-polynomials deﬁning UinvolvesX1in at least one of the equations. Let
G1,...,G sbe such a family chosen so that pd1:= degX1(G1)is minimized among all p-
polynomials involving X1which appear in a family of ≤r p-polynomials deﬁning U. If
s < r , then we are done by induction, so assume that s=r. For each i >1, one has
Gi≡Ri(modG1)for somep-polynomial Risuch that degX1(Ri)< pd1[Rosengarten2,
Lem.6.3]. It follows from the minimality of pd1thatX1does not appear in any of the Ri
fori>1. Further,G1together with the Rideﬁnes the same group Uas the original Gi. If
R2,...,R rall vanish, then we are in the already-treated case r= 1. Otherwise, if the Riare
not all0, then the family R2,...,R r∈k[X2,...,X n]deﬁnes a subgroup which by induction
may also be described after a change of variables σon the last n−1coordinates (so that
G1still involves the variable X1even after the change of variables) by a family F1,...,F t
ofp-polynomials as in the statement of the proposition (so in pa rticulart < r) in which
necessarily t>0. ThenG1together with the Fiyields a deﬁning family of p-polynomials
forσ(U)of the desired shape.
We next show that vector subgroups of commutative groups wit h vanishing Verschiebung
may be split oﬀ as direct factors.
10Proposition 2.4. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic p. Then any exact sequence of commu-
tativek-group schemes with vanishing Verschiebung
0−→Gn
ai− −→U−→W−→0 (2.1)
splits.
Proof. This follows from [DG, Ch.IV, §3, Corr.6.7], because Hom(Gn
a,Ga)is a freek[F]-
module, where Fdenotes the (relative) Frobenius.
As a consequence of Propositions 2.3 and 2.4, we will now dedu ce that every subgroup
of a vector group is itself the product of a vector group and a g roup which may be ﬁltered
by unipotent groups described as hypersurfaces in vector gr oups.
Proposition 2.5. Letkbe an inﬁnite ﬁeld of characteristic p>0, and letGbe a commu-
tativek-group scheme with vanishing Verschiebung. Then G≃V×U, whereVis a vector
group, and there is a ﬁltration 0 =U0⊂U1⊂ ··· ⊂Un=Usuch that, for each 1≤i≤n,
Ui/Ui−1is ak-group scheme of the form {Fi= 0} ⊂Gniafor some reduced p-polynomial
Fi∈k[X1,...,X ni]. In particular, each Ui/Ui−1is semiwound.
Proof. The assertion about the semiwoundness of the quotients Ui/Ui−1follows from [CGP,
Lem.B.1.7, (1) =⇒(2)]. LetV⊂Gbe the subgroup generated by all k-homomorphisms
Ga→G. By Proposition 2.4, this is a vector group such that G/Vis semiwound, and the
extension
0−→V−→G−→G/V−→0
splits, so we may assume that G=Uis semiwound. By [DG, Ch.IV, §3, Th.6.6], Uis a
k-subgroup of a vector group Gn
a, and by [CGP, Th.B.2.5] again, the quotient Gn
a/Uis
isomorphic to some Gt
a. Since the homomorphisms Gn
a→Gaare exactly the p-polynomials
innvariables, it follows that Umay be described as the vanishing locus of tp-polynomials
insideGn
a. We prove that Uhas a ﬁltration of the desired form by induction on t, noting
thatt= 0is impossible unless n= 0andU= 0becauseUis semiwound. So assume that
U/\e}atio\slash= 0and therefore cannot be described by 0equations.
Upon a change of variables, we may describe UinsideGn
aby a system of equations
F1,...,F mas in Proposition 2.3 with 0<m≤t. Ifm<t , then we are done by induction,
so assume that m=t. ThenFt∈k[Xt+r,...,X n]is a reduced p-polynomial in Gn−t−r+1
a ,
and its vanishing locus UFtis a semiwound k-subgroup scheme of Gn−t−r+1
a by [CGP,
Lem.B.1.7, (1) =⇒(2)]. We claim that the obvious map U→UFtis fppf surjective with
kernel described by <tequations, in which case the proof is complete by induction.
First we note that the kernel of the map U→UFtis the subgroup scheme of G{1,...,t+r−1}
a
described as the vanishing locus of the p-polynomials Fi(X1,...,X t+r−1,0,...,0)for1≤
i<t. In particular, it is deﬁned by <tequations. It only remains, therefore, to check that
the mapU→UFtis fppf surjective. For this, consider for each 1≤i < t thek-subgroup
11Wi⊂G{i,...,n}
a deﬁned as the vanishing locus of Fi,...,F t, and letWt:=UFt. Then we
have mapsWi→Wi+1for1≤i<tgiven by projection onto the last n−icoordinates for
i<t−1and projection onto the last n−t−r+1coordinates when i=t−1. We claim
that each such map is fppf surjective, which will prove the re sult. To see this, we simply
note that the ﬁber of Wiabove a point (xf(i+1),...,x n)∈Wi+1(R)for somek-algebraR,
where
f(i) :=/braceleftBigg
i, i<t
t+r, i=t
is the spectrum of the R-algebra
Fi(Xi,...,X f(i+1)−1,0,...,0)+Fi(0,...,0,xf(i+1),...,x n) = 0.
This is an fppf R-algebra because Fiinvolves the variable Xi(Proposition 2.3(i)).
Lemma 2.6. Suppose given a short exact sequence of commutative unipote ntk-group
schemes
0−→U−→E−→Gn
a−→0.
IfUis semiwound with vanishing Verschiebung, then Ehas vanishing Verschiebung.
Proof. We have the Frobenius twisted exact sequence
0−→U(p)−→E(p)−→Gn
a−→0
(because (Gn
a)(p)≃Gn
a). BecauseUandGn
ahave vanishing Verschiebung, the Verschiebung
ofEdescends to a homomorphism Gn
a≃E(p)/U(p)→U. BecauseUis semiwound, this
homomorphism vanishes.
Subgroups of vector groups play a fundamental role in the the ory of unipotent groups
because every unipotent group admits a ﬁltration whose succ essive quotients are subgroups
of vector groups. A somewhat subtler statement says that, fo rUsemiwound, we may ensure
that the quotients inherit semiwoundness and thereby ensur e that there is a ﬁltration by
semiwound hypersurface groups.
Proposition 2.7. Letkbe an inﬁnite ﬁeld, and let Ube a commutative semiwound unipo-
tentk-group. Then there is a ﬁltration 1 =U0⊂U1⊂ ··· ⊂Um=Usuch that, for all
1≤i≤m,Ui/Ui−1≃ {Fi= 0} ⊂Gniafor some reduced p-polynomial Fi∈k[X1,...,X ni].
Proof. In light of Proposition 2.5, it suﬃces to prove the existence of a ﬁltration 1 =U0⊂
U1⊂ ··· ⊂Um=Usuch that, for all 1≤i≤m,Ui/Ui−1is semiwound with vanishing
Verschiebung. Because Uis unipotent, there is such a ﬁltration of some length m, possibly
sans the semiwoundness condition. We then prove that Uhas a ﬁltration of the required sort
by induction on m. The case m= 0is trivial, so assume that m>0. LetV⊂U:=U/U1
denote its maximal split unipotent k-subgroup, a vector group by [CGP, Th.B.2.5]. Let
12π:U→Udenote the quotient map, and let U′
1:=π−1(V)⊂U. By Lemma 2.6, U′
1has
vanishing Verschiebung. Since U/U′
1is semiwound and admits a ﬁltration of length < m
by Verschiebung-trivial groups, we are done by induction.
3 Universal p-polynomials
In this section we introduce universal p-polynomials, which are intimately connected to
permawound groups, playing a similar role in the theory of pe rmawound groups to that
played by reduced p-polynomials in the theory of wound unipotent groups. (More precisely,
those reduced p-polynomials with universal principal part play the analog ous role to that
played by reduced p-polynomials.) Here is the key deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.1. LetP∈k[X1,...,X n]be a monogeneous p-polynomial. Then Pdeﬁnes
a group homomorphism kn→k, and we say that Pisuniversal over k, or just universal if
kis clear from context, when this homomorphism is surjective .
Example 3.2.Ifkis imperfect and pn>2, then the monogeneous p-polynomial Xpn+aYpn
(witha∈k) is not universal. Indeed, if it is universal, then [k:kpn]≤2. But
[k:kpn] =n−1/productdisplay
i=0[kpi:kpi+1] =n−1/productdisplay
i=0[k:kp] = [k:kp]n
is a positive power of pnbecausekis imperfect.
Recall that a set Sof elements of a characteristic pﬁeldkis called ap-basis forkif any
of the following equivalent conditions hold:
(i)
k=/circleplusdisplay
f/parenleftBigg/productdisplay
λ∈Sλf(λ)/parenrightBigg
kp,
where the sum runs over all maps f:S→ {0,1,...,p−1}which vanish at all but
ﬁnitely many elements of S.
(ii) The elements dλform a basis for Ω1
kasλruns overS.
(iii) The elements λ1/pwithλ∈Sform a minimal set of generators of k1/p/k.
Recall also that the degree of imperfection of kis the size of any p-basis ofk.
Now we introduce a piece of notation that we will use repeated ly in the sequel.
Deﬁnition 3.3. For an integer m≥0, we denote by Imthe set of functions {1,...,r} →
{0,1,...,pm−1}. Whenm= 1, we also denote this set by I.
13Example 3.4.Suppose that {λ1,...,λ r}is ap-basis fork. Let
P(Xf|f∈I) :=/summationdisplay
f∈I/parenleftBiggr/productdisplay
i=1λf(i)
i/parenrightBigg
Xp
f.
ThenPis reduced and universal. Indeed, this is just a reformulati on of condition (i) above
in the deﬁnition of a p-basis.
The following proposition gives a numerical criterion for a reduced monogeneous p-
polynomial to be universal.
Proposition 3.5. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic p>0and degree of imperfection r≤ ∞,
and letP∈k[X1,...,X n]be a monogeneous p-polynomial.
(i) IfPis reduced, then
n/summationdisplay
i=1degXi(P)−r≤1, (3.1)
where by convention, 1−∞= 1andc−∞= 0forc >1. Equality holds if and only if
Pis universal.
(ii) Suppose that r<∞. If
n/summationdisplay
i=1degXi(P)−r= 1, (3.2)
thenPis reduced if and only if it is universal.
Proof. Whenkhas inﬁnite degree of imperfection, this just says that a red uced mono-
geneousp-polynomial can contain at most one term of degree 1– which is clear – and that
it is universal if and only if there is a term of degree 1. Clearly, this is suﬃcient for univer-
sality. For necessity, note that if no variable appears with degree1, thenP(k,...,k)⊂k
is contained in a ﬁnite-dimensional kp-subspace of k, hence cannot be all of k.
Now suppose that khas degree of imperfection r<∞, and choose a p-basisλ1,...,λ r
ofk. For eachm≥0, letFm∈k[Xf|f∈Im]be the monogeneous p-polynomial
Fm:=/summationdisplay
f∈Im/parenleftBiggr/productdisplay
i=1λf(i)
i/parenrightBigg
Xpm
f.
ThenFmis reduced and universal.
Now letP∈k[Y1,...,Y n]be a monogeneous p-polynomial, let pd
i:= degYi(P)for each
i, and letN:= max idi. For each variable Yi, replaceYiinPbyFmi(Xi,f|f∈Imi),
wheremi:=N−di. This yields a new p-polynomial ˜Pthat is homogeneous. Furthermore,
because each Fmis reduced and universal, one has that ˜Pis reduced, respectively universal,
14if and only if Pis reduced, respectively universal. Further, if we denote t he left side of (3.1)
byφ(P), thenφ(P) =φ(˜P). Thus both parts (i) and (ii) are reduced to the case in which
Pis homogeneous, say of degree pN.
(i) This says that a reduced homogeneous p-polynomial of degree pNhas≤prNterms,
with equality if and only if it is universal. Both assertions f ollow from the fact that
[k:kpN] =N−1/productdisplay
i=0[kpi:kpi+1] =N−1/productdisplay
i=0[k:kp] =prN. (3.3)
(ii) The only if direction follows from part (i). For the if di rection, suppose that Pis not
reduced. The condition (3.2) says that Pcontains exactly prNterms. The nonreducedness
ofPsays that the coeﬃcients of Pare linearly dependent over kpN. Equation (3.3) then
implies that these coeﬃcients do not span koverkpN– that is,Pis not universal.
Proposition 3.6. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pand degree of imperfection r≤ ∞, let
P∈k[X1,...,X n]be a monogeneous p-polynomial, and let K/kbe an extension ﬁeld.
(i) IfK/kis separable, then Pis reduced over kif and only if it is reduced over K.
(ii) IfK/kis separable and Kalso has degree of imperfection r(for instance, if K/kis
separable algebraic ), thenPis universal over kif and only if it is universal over K.
Proof. Assertion (i) is [Rosengarten2, Lem.2.8]. For (ii), Propos ition 2.2 allows us to make
a change of variables and thereby assume that P∈k[X1,...,X n]is reduced (possibly
after replacing nby a smaller value and renaming). Then Pis also reduced over Kby
(i), and because kandKhave the same degree of imperfection, the assertion follows from
Proposition (3.5)(i).
4 Ext groups and universal p-polynomials
In this section we relate universal p-polynomials to the groups Exti(Ga,U)fori= 1,2with
Uunipotent. This will play a crucial role in our characteriza tion in §6 of those p-polynomials
deﬁning permawound groups.
We begin with the following simple lemma.
Lemma 4.1. LetF∈k[X1,...,X n]be a reduced p-polynomial with principal part P,
and suppose given Y1,...,Y n∈k[T]not all constant. Then the leading coeﬃcient of
F(Y1,...,Y n)∈k[T]is of the form P(c1,...,cn)/\e}atio\slash= 0for someci∈k.
Proof. Letdi:= degXi(F)andD:= max idideg(Yi(T)). ThenD>0, and
deg(F(Y1(T),...Yn(T))≤D.
15If we letcidenote the coeﬃcient of TD/diinYi(T), then some cj/\e}atio\slash= 0(because the Yiare not
all constant), and TDappears in F(Y1(T),...,Y n(T))with coeﬃcient P(c1,...,cn)/\e}atio\slash= 0,
where the nonvanishing is because Pis reduced.
LetF:Shk→Abbe an additive functor from the category of sheaves on the (bi g)
fppf site of Spec(k)to the category of abelian groups. Then the natural k-action on Gavia
λ·X=λXforX∈Gainduces ak-vector space structure on F(Ga). In particular, we
apply this when F:= Ext1(·,G)forGa sheaf.
The following result allows us to give an intrinsic characte rization of those hypersurface
groups deﬁned by a reduced p-polynomial with universal principal part. This will, amon g
other things, play a crucial role in our proof of the criterio n for permawoundness (Theorem
6.10).
Proposition 4.2. LetF∈k[X1,...,X n] (withn >0)be a reduced p-polynomial with
principal part P, and letU:={F= 0} ⊂Gn
abe thek-group scheme it deﬁnes. Then Pis
universal if and only if the k-vector space Ext1(Ga,U)is ﬁnite-dimensional.
Proof. The groupUis deﬁned by the exact sequence
0−→Ui− −→Gn
aF− −→Ga−→0.
By the eﬀectivity of aﬃne descent for relatively aﬃne schemes , every element of Ext1(Ga,U)
is represented by a scheme E. Furthermore, Ehas vanishing Verschiebung by Lemma 2.6.
Therefore, by Proposition 2.4, i∗(E) = 0∈Ext1(Ga,Gn
a). It follows that Ext1(Ga,U)
may be identiﬁed with the cokernel of the map F∗: Hom(Ga,Gn
a)→Hom(Ga,Ga). Fur-
thermore, identifying elements of Hom(Ga,Ga)withp-polynomials f∈k[T], thek-linear
action is given by (λ·f)(T) :=f(λT)forλ∈k.
First suppose that Pis not universal, and we will show that Ext1(Ga,U)is inﬁnite-
dimensional. We are free to multiply Fby a nonzero constant and thereby assume that
1/∈P(k,...,k). LetpN:= max idegXi(F). Then we claim that the classes of the p-
polynomials TpminExt1(Ga,U)are linearly independent over kasmvaries over the
integers≥N. We need to show that, for any λN,...,λ s∈kwithλs/\e}atio\slash= 0, thep-polynomial/summationtexts
i=Nλpi
iTpidoes not lie in F∗(Hom(Ga,Gn
a)). That is, we need to show that one cannot
writes/summationdisplay
i=Nλpi
iTpi=F(Y1(T),...,Y n(T))
withYi∈k[T]p-polynomials. If one does have a solution to this equation, t hen Lemma
4.1 implies that equating leading coeﬃcients yields an equa tion
P(c1,...,cn) =λps
s.
Ifpdi:= degXi(P), then by assumption di≤N≤s, so dividing by λps, one obtains that
P(c1/λps−d1
s,...,cn/λps−dn
s) = 1,
16in violation of the assumption that 1/∈P(k,...,k). This completes the proof of the if
direction.
Conversely, suppose that Pis universal, and we will prove that Ext1(Ga,U)is ﬁnite-
dimensional. If khas inﬁnite degree of imperfection, then F∈k[X]has degree 1by
Proposition 3.5, hence U= 0and the assertion is immediate, so assume that khas ﬁnite
degree of imperfection. Let pN:= max idegXi(F). Then we claim that every element of
Ext1(Ga,U)is represented by a p-polynomial of degree <pN. Assuming this, we are done
because the k-linear action of λ∈ksendsaiTpitoaiλpiTpi, and[k:kpi]<∞becausek
has ﬁnite degree of imperfection.
To prove that every element of Ext1(Ga,U)is indeed the image of a p-polynomial of
degree<pN, we proceed by induction on the degree, the degree <pNcase being trivial. So
suppose given m≥N. It suﬃces to show that every monomial aTpmwitha∈kis equivalent
moduloF∗(Hom(Ga,Gn
a))to ap-polynomial of degree < pN. BecausePis universal, we
may choose c1,...,cn∈ksuch thatP(c1,...,cn) =a. Then consider F(Y1(T),...,Y n(T)),
whereYi(T) :=ciTpm−di. Then the leading term of F(Y1(T),...,Y n(T))isP(c1,...,cn)Tpm=
aTpm, so thataTpm−F(Y1(T),...,Y n(T))is ap-polynomial of degree <pm, and therefore
by induction is equivalent modulo F∗(Hom(Ga,Gn
a))to ap-polynomial of degree <pN. It
follows that the same is true of aTpm, so the proof is complete.
We will require the following technical lemma which may be th ought of as a sort of
division algorithm.
Lemma 4.3. LetF∈k[X1,...,X n]be a reduced p-polynomial whose principal part
P(X1,...,X n) =n/summationdisplay
i=1aiXpdi
i
is universal. Let R:=k[Y1,...,Y m], and letA⊂Rdenote the subgroup F(R,...,R ).
Then for every g∈Rwith vanishing constant term, there is a unique h∈Rwith vanishing
constant term such that g≡h(modA)and such that, for every 1≤i≤nand every
m-tuple/vector sof nonnegative integers, the coeﬃcient of (/vectorY/vector s)pdiinhlies inP(k,...,0,...,k),
where the 0is in theith coordinate. Further, if Sgdenotes the set of ordered m-tuples
/vector s∈Nmsuch that the monomial /vectorY/vector sappears with nonzero coeﬃcient in g, thenSh⊂
p−∞Sg:=∪t≥0p−tSg.
Proof. BecausePis reduced and universal, every α∈kmay be written in the form
P(c1,...,cn)for unique ci∈k. Letφ:k→Ndenote the function which sends αto
#{i|ci/\e}atio\slash= 0}. Forf∈k[Y1,...,Y m], letd(f)denote the minimal positive integer dsuch
thatfcontains a monomial of degree dwhich violates the condition required of hin the
lemma. That is, for some 1≤i≤n,fcontains a monomial of degree dof the form (/vectorY/vector s)pdi
whose coeﬃcient bsatisﬁesb=P(c1,...,cn)withci/\e}atio\slash= 0. If no such monomial exists, we
17deﬁned(f) := 0 . Next, deﬁne φ(f)to be the sum over all monomials Minfof degreed(f)
ofφ(cM), wherecMis the coeﬃcient of Minf.
To prove the existence of has in the lemma, choose h≡g(modA)that minimizes
(d(h),φ(h)), ordered lexicographically, among those polynomials ≡g(modA)such that
only monomials with multidegree lying in p−∞Sgappear inh. (In particular, hhas van-
ishing constant term.) Then we claim that hhas the property required by the lemma. If
not, then for some nonzero m-tuple/vector sof nonnegative integers, and some 1≤i≤n, the
coeﬃcientbof(/vectorY/vector s)pdiinhsatisﬁesb=P(r1,...,rn)with allrj∈kandri/\e}atio\slash= 0. Choose
such a monomial of degree d(h). Consider ˜h:=h−F(0,...,ri/vectorY/vector s,...,0), where all terms
are0except for the term ri/vectorY/vector sappearing in the ith place. Then ˜honly modiﬁes hby
replacing the coeﬃcient b=P(r1,...,rn)with˜b:=P(r1,...,0,...,rn)(where the 0is in
theith spot) and by adding terms of multidegree lying in ∪t>0p−tSh⊂ ∪t>0p−tSg. Note in
particular that φ(˜b)<φ(b). We therefore see that either d(˜h)<d(h)or thatd(˜h) =d(h)
butφ(˜h)<φ(h). In either case, this violates the minimality of h. We conclude that hdoes
indeed satisfy the property required by the lemma.
Finally, it remains to prove uniqueness of h≡g(modA)as in the lemma. For this,
suppose given h1,h2equivalent to gand which both satisfy the property required by the
lemma. By considering h1−h2, we may assume that g= 0, so we have h∈Asatisfying the
requirement of the lemma and we wish to show that h= 0. Suppose not. Because hhas
vanishing constant term, it follows that we may write h=F(G1,...,G n)withGi∈Rnot
all constant. Suppose that Gi0is such that pdideg(Gi)is maximized when i=i0, and let
b/vectorY/vector sbe a monomial of degree deg(Gi0)appearing in Gi0. Then the coeﬃcient of (/vectorY/vector s)pdi0
appearing in h=F(G1,...,G n)isP(r1,...,rn)for someri∈kwithri0=b/\e}atio\slash= 0. This
violates the required condition on h, so this contradiction shows that in fact h= 0, as
desired.
Lemma 4.4. For a commutative unipotent k-group scheme Uover a ﬁeld k, and an aﬃne
k-schemeX, one has H2(X,U) = 0.
Proof. The proof in the case X= Spec(k)is given in [TV, Lem.3.3]. The same argu-
ment goes through with Spec(k)replaced by any aﬃne k-schemeX, using the fact that
Hi(X,Ga) = 0fori>0. This last assertion follows from the fact that Gais a quasi-coherent
sheaf, hence its Zariski and fppf cohomology agree.
Next we will relate universal p-polynomials to second Ext groups. This will require an
explicit description of such groups, which we obtain in the f ollowing lemma.
Lemma 4.5. LetUbe a commutative semiwound unipotent k-group scheme. Then one has
an isomorphism, functorial in Uand in endomorphisms of Ga, between Ext2(Ga,U)and
the middle cohomology of the complex
H1(Ga,U)d1− −→H1(G2

Proof. The proof makes use of certain spectral sequences due to Breen . For the reader’s
convenience, we recall the properties of these sequences in appendix B. We use the notation
of that appendix here. To begin with, we have the sequence
′Ei,j
2= Exti(Hj(A(Ga)),U) =⇒Exti+j(A(Ga),U).
(See (B.8.) Then′Ei,1
2and′E0,2
2both vanish by (B.2) with G=Ga, plus the fact that
Uis semiwound (for the latter vanishing). It follows that Ext2(A(Ga),U)≃′E2,0
2=
Ext2(Ga,U). Thus we may replace the latter group by the former in proving the lemma.
To compute Ext2(A(Ga),U), we use the other Breen spectral sequence, which takes the
form
Ei,j
1=/tildewideHj(Xi,U) =⇒Exti+j(A(Ga),U).
(See (B.7).) Because Uis semiwound, Ei,0
1= 0, andE0,2
1= 0by Lemma 4.4. It follows that
Ext2(A(Ga),U)≃E1,1
2. But by deﬁnition of the Breen sequence, E1,1
2is exactly the middle
cohomology of the sequence in the lemma. The identiﬁcation o f the lemma is functorial
because of the functoriality of the Breen spectral sequences .
Lemma 4.6. LetF∈k[X1,...,X n]be a reduced p-polynomial whose principal part Pis
universal, and let U:={F= 0} ⊂Gn
a. ThenExt2(Ga,U)is a ﬁnite-dimensional k-vector
space.
Proof. Ifkhas inﬁnite degree of imperfection, then n= 1andU= 0by Proposition 3.5,
so the assertion is trivial. Assume, therefore, that khas ﬁnite degree of imperfection. We
identifyH1(T,U)with the quotient of H0(T,Ga)byF(H0(T,Ga),...,H0(T,Ga))for aﬃne
k-schemesT. In particular, we will do this with Tequal to various powers of Ga. We use
Lemma 4.5 to identify Ext2(Ga,U)with the middle cohomology group Cof the sequence
of that lemma.
So suppose given α∈Ext2(Ga,U), represented by a class in H1(G2
a,U), and let this class
in turn be represented via the above identiﬁcation by an elem entg∈k[X,Y]. Modifying
19gbyf(X+Y)−f(X)−f(Y)forf∈k[T]does not change its class in H1. In particular,
we may take fto be a suitable constant and thereby assume that ghas vanishing constant
term. By Lemma 4.3, we may assume that gis such that, for every 1≤i≤nand
every ordered pair (s1,s2)of nonnegative integers, the coeﬃcient of (Xs1Ys2)pdiinglies in
P(k,...,0,...,k), where the 0is in theith coordinate (and the diare as in Lemma 4.3).
Becausegrepresents a class in C, the polynomials
g(X,Y)−g(Y,X)∈k[X,Y]
g(X,Y+Z)+g(Y,Z)−g(X+Y,Z)−g(X,Y)∈k[X,Y,Z] (4.1)
represent trivial cohomology classes in H1(G2
a,U)andH1(G3
a,U), respectively. On the
other hand, for every 1≤i≤nand every ordered pair (s1,s2)of nonnegative integers, the
coeﬃcient of (Xs1Ys2)pdiinglies inP(k,...,0,...,k), where the 0is in theith coordinate.
It follows that the same holds for the two polynomials appear ing above (with the analogous
condition in 3variables in the case of the second polynomial in (4.1)). Sin ce they represent
trivial cohomology classes, they lie in F(k[X,Y]n)andF(k[X,Y,Z]n), respectively. By the
uniqueness assertion of Lemma 4.3, it follows that the two po lynomials in (4.1) vanish. By
[Rosengarten1, Lem.2.8.2], gmay be written in the form
g(X,Y) =f(X+Y)−f(X)−f(Y)+N/summationdisplay
i=0ri·S(Xpi,Ypi),
for somef∈k[X]and someri∈k, whereS(X,Y)∈Fp[X,Y]is the mod preduction of
the Witt polynomial [(X+Y)p−Xp−Yp]/p∈Z[X,Y]. Thus, by modifying gbyd1of the
element of H1(Ga,U)represented by f, we obtain that our element α∈Cis represented
by a polynomial of the form/summationtextN
i=0ri·S(Xpi,Ypi)withrN/\e}atio\slash= 0ifN≥0. We may apply
Lemma 4.3 again to conclude that αis represented by a polynomial h(X,Y)∈k[X,Y]
such that each monomial appearing with nonzero coeﬃcient in his of the form (XaYp−a)ps
withs < M:= max idi. In particular, every element of Cis represented by a sum of
monomials of degree a power of pthat is<pM . The action of λ∈kon the class in Cof a
homogeneous polynomial Hof degreeptis represented by λptH. (Note that this k-action
is identiﬁed with the k-action on Ext2(Ga,U)thanks to the functoriality aspect of Lemma
4.5.) Because [k:kpt]<∞for allt(sincekhas ﬁnite degree of imperfection), it follows
thatCis spanned by ﬁnitely many vectors.
The deﬁnition of permawoundness for a group Uis rather strong in that it imposes a
condition on extensions of Gaby any quotient group of U, and this condition on quotients
will play an essential role in proving the fundamental fact t hat permawound groups admit
ﬁltrations as in Theorem 1.5. In order to show that groups are permawound, therefore, we
need a mechanism for dealing with quotients. The following l emma is that mechanism.
20Lemma 4.7. LetUbe a commutative unipotent k-group scheme, and suppose that 0 =
U0⊂U1⊂ ··· ⊂Um=Uis such that, for each 0≤i < m ,Ui+1/Ui≃ {Fi= 0} ⊂Gnia
for a reduced p-polynomial Fi∈k[X1,...,X ni]with principal part Pi. IfExt1(Ga,U)is
a ﬁnite-dimensional k-vector space, then each Piis universal and Ext2(Ga,U)is a ﬁnite-
dimensional k-vector space.
Proof. We proceed by induction on the length of the ﬁltration. If the ﬁltration has length
0, then the assertion is immediate. Now suppose that m >0, and letW:=U/Um−1.
Note that each group in the ﬁltration is semiwound by [CGP, Le m.B.1.7, (1) =⇒(2)]. In
particular, Hom(Ga,W) = 0, so the ﬁnite-dimensionality of Ext1(Ga,U)implies the same
forExt1(Ga,Um−1). By induction, it follows that Piis universal for 0≤i<m−1and that
Ext2(Ga,Um−1)is ﬁnite-dimensional . We deduce that Ext1(Ga,W)is ﬁnite-dimensional,
soPm−1is universal by Proposition 4.2. Hence Ext2(Ga,W)is ﬁnite-dimensional by Lemma
4.6, soExt2(Ga,U)is also ﬁnite-dimensional.
Remark 4.8.It is possible to prove the above results without making use o f Breen’s spectral
sequences, by deﬁning in an ad hoc manner the cohomology grou p appearing in Lemma 4.5,
replacing the group Ext1(Ga,U)with the group H1(Ga,U)prim(which one may show to
be isomorphic to Ext1(Ga,U)whenUis semiwound), and then showing that these groups
satisfy the same formal properties as the ﬁrst and second Ext groups. We will never use
this.
5 (Quasi-)weak permawoundness
In this section, as a tool for studying permawound groups, we introduce (and prove some
basic properties of) the notion of (quasi-)weak permawound ness, which is more restrictive
than permawoundness in that it only applies to commutative g roups, but less so in that
it does not require smoothness. This combination of restric tiveness and looseness makes
(quasi-)weak permawoundness a technically convenient too l.
Deﬁnition 5.1. We say that a commutative unipotent k-group scheme Uisk-(quasi-
)weakly permawound , or just (quasi-)weakly permawound when kis clear from context,
when the following conditions holds. For every exact sequen ce ofcommutative k-group
schemes
(0−→)U−→E−→Ga−→1,
Econtains ak-subgroup scheme k-isomorphic to Ga.
Note that, unlike in the deﬁnition of permawoundness, we do n ot requireUto be smooth
in the deﬁnition of (quasi-)weak permawoundness. Clearly, weak permawoundness implies
quasi-weak permawoundness, and for smooth commutative U, permawoundness implies
weak permawoundness.
21Proposition 5.2. Letkbe a perfect ﬁeld.
(i) Every smooth unipotent k-group scheme is permawound.
(ii) Every commutative unipotent k-group scheme is (quasi-)weakly permawound.
Proof. All assertions follow from the claim that, for any extension of unipotent k-groups
1−→U−→E−→Ga−→1,
Econtains a copy of Ga. To see this, consider E0
red⊂E. Becausekis perfect, this is a
smooth unipotent k-subgroup scheme of E. It is also connected and nontrivial (the latter
becauseEadmits a positive-dimensional quotient). Therefore, agai n becausekis perfect,
it is split and nontrivial, hence Eadmits a nontrivial split unipotent k-subgroup.
Proposition 5.2 tells us that permawoundness is not an inter esting notion over perfect
ﬁelds.
Proposition 5.3. Every split unipotent k-group scheme Uis permawound. If Uis com-
mutative, then it is also (quasi-)weakly permawound.
Proof. Because quotient groups of split unipotent groups are also sp lit, the proposition
follows from the following claim. Given an exact sequence
1−→U−→E−→Ga−→1,
withUsplit, thenEcontains a copy of Ga. Indeed, given such a sequence, Eis necessarily
split unipotent and nontrivial, hence contains a copy of Ga.
The following proposition is immediate from the deﬁnition o f (weak) permawoundness.
Proposition 5.4. Any quotient group of a (weakly) permawound k-group scheme is also
(weakly) permawound.
(Quasi-)weak permawoundness is inherited by subgroups wit h semiwound quotient.
Proposition 5.5. LetU′⊂Ube unipotent k-group schemes with U′central inU, and
assume that U′′:=U/U′is semiwound. Assume either that Uis permawound or that Uis
commutative and (quasi-)weakly permawound. Then U′is (quasi-)weakly permawound.
Proof. Suppose given an exact sequence
(0−→)U′−→E−→Ga−→0.
22Consider the following commutative diagram of exact sequen ces in which the top left square
is a pushout diagram (and where we use centrality of U′⊂Uin the permawound case to
ensure that this pushout is a k-group scheme):
(0 )U′E Ga0
(0 )U G Ga0
U′′U′′g
Permawoundity, or (quasi-)weak permawoundness, of Uimplies that there is an inclusion
f:Ga֒→G. Because U′′is semiwound, g◦f= 1, soffactors through an inclusion
Ga֒→E.
The following simple proposition is useful.
Proposition 5.6. Suppose given an exact sequence of commutative unipotent k-group
schemes
0−→U′−→U−→U′′−→0.
IfU′andU′′are (quasi-)weakly permawound, then so is U.
Proof. Suppose given an exact sequence of commutative k-groups
(0−→)Uf− −→E−→Ga−→0. (5.1)
ThenE/f(U′)sits in a similar exact sequence with U′′on the left instead of U, so by
(quasi-)weak permawoundness of U′′,E/f(U′)contains a k-subgroup G≃Ga. Letting
π:E→E/f(U′)denote the quotient map, π−1(G)then sits in an exact sequence analogous
to (5.1) but with U′on the left. (Quasi-)weak permawoundness of U′then implies that
π−1(G)⊂Econtains a copy of Ga.
6 Permawound subgroups of vector groups
In this section we will give a criterion characterizing thos ep-polynomials which deﬁne
permawound groups (Theorem 6.10) and use it to prove that per mawound groups are
“ubiquitous” in a suitable sense (Theorem 6.12). We ﬁrst nee d a criterion for quasi-weak
permawoundness (which is easier to analyze than weak permaw oundness because there is
no need to deal with quotients).
Proposition 6.1. LetF∈k[X1,...,X n] (n > 0)be a reduced p-polynomial with principal
partP, and letU:={F= 0} ⊂Gn
a. ThenUis quasi-weakly permawound if and only if P
is universal.
23Proof. First suppose that Pis not universal, and we will show that Uis not quasi-weakly
permawound. We may multiply Fby a nonzero constant and thereby assume that 1/∈
P(k,...,k). Letpdi:= degXi(F)andN:= max idi. Consider the p-polynomial
G(T,X1,...,X n) :=TpN−F(X1,...,X n)∈k[X1,...,X n,T].
LetE:={G= 0} ⊂Gn+1
a. The map E→Gawhich projects onto the Tcoordinate is
surjective with kernel U, so in order to prove that Uis not quasi-weakly permawound, it
suﬃces to show that Eis semiwound.
The principal part of GisTpN−P(X1,...,X n). We claim that this has no nontrivial
zeroes over k– that is,Gis reduced. Indeed, suppose that tpN=P(x1,...,x n)with
t,xi∈k. Ift/\e}atio\slash= 0, then one may divide by tpNto obtain
1 =P(x1/tpN−d1,...,x n/tpN−dn),
in violation of the assumption that Pdoes not represent 1. It follows that t= 0. Because
Pis reduced by assumption, it then follows that xi= 0for alli. ThusGis reduced, hence
Eis semiwound by [CGP, Lem.B.1.7, (1) =⇒(2)].
Next suppose that Pis universal, and we will show that Uis quasi-weakly permawound.
Suppose given an exact sequence of commutative k-groups
0−→U−→E−→Ga−→0.
We must show that Econtains a copy of Ga. By Lemma 2.6, Ehas vanishing Verschiebung.
Now consider the following commutative diagram of exact seq uences in which the top left
square is a pushout diagram:
0U E Ga0
0Gn
aW Ga0
GaGaF G
ThenWalso has vanishing Verschiebung, so by Proposition 2.4, the middle row splits.
Choosing a splitting W≃Gn
a×Ga, the map Gis given by Fon theGn
acoordinate,
and by some p-polynomial H∈k[Xn+1]on theGacoordinate. The group Eis therefore
isomorphic to the vanishing locus of G:=F(X1,...,X n) +H(Xn+1)∈k[X1,...,X n+1].
LetPH(Xn+1) =aXpd
n+1denote the principal part of H. (Possibly H= 0, in which
casea= 0.) Note that the principal part PG:=P(X1,...,X n) +PH(Xn+1)ofGis
universal, because Pis, and that it has a nontrivial zero: Choosing x1,...,x n∈ksuch
thatP(x1,...,x n) =−a, the tuple (x1,...,x n,1)yields a nontrivial zero of PG. Among
24those non-reduced p-polynomials R∈k[X1,...,X n+1]with universal principal part deﬁning
E, choose one R0such that the quantity/summationtextn+1
i=1degXi(R0)is minimized, where we make the
convention that degXi(R) = 0 ifXidoes not appear in R. Then we claim that at least one
of theXi– sayXi0– does not appear in R0. In that case, the k-subgroup of Edeﬁned by
the condition that Xi= 0for alli/\e}atio\slash=i0is a copy of Gasitting inside E, so the proof will
be complete.
To prove the claim, suppose for the sake of contradiction tha t all of the Xiappear in
R0. Letpdi:= degXi(R0). Choose a nontrivial zero (x1,...,x n+1)∈kn+1of the principal
partP0ofR0. Leti0be such that xi0/\e}atio\slash= 0, and such that di≤di0for allisuch thatxi/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Consider the invertible change of variables on Gn+1
adeﬁned by
Xi/mapsto→

Xi, x i= 0
xi0Xi0, i =i0
Xi+xiXpdi0−di
i0,else.
Then the new p-polynomial R′obtained from R0after making this change of variables
satisﬁes degXi(R′) = degXi(R0)fori/\e}atio\slash=i0anddegXi0(R′)<degXi0(R0), so the sum of
the degrees in the Xiis strictly smaller for R′than forR0. On the other hand, we claim
that the principal part P′ofR′is universal and has a nontrivial zero over k, which will
contradict the minimality of R0and prove the claim.
We ﬁrst prove that P′(X1,...,0,...,X n+1), where the 0is in thei0spot, is universal.
Indeed, we know that P′andP0agree when one sets Xi0= 0, so it suﬃces to show that
P0, which is universal, remains so upon throwing out Xi0. To see this, let aXpdi0
i0be the
monomial in Xi0appearing in P0. Then one has that
a(−xi0)pdi0=P0(x1,...,0,...,x n+1),
where the 0is in thei0spot. We therefore obtain for all y∈k
aypdi0=P(−x1(y/xi0)pdi0−d1,...,0,...,−xn+1(y/xi0)pdi0−dn+1),
where we place a 0in thei0spot and, by convention, the term −xi(y/xi0)pdi0−diis just
taken to be 0ifxi= 0. In particular, the terms all make sense because i0was chosen so
thatdi0≥diifxi/\e}atio\slash= 0. We therefore see that every element of krepresented by aXpdi0
i0
is also represented by P0withXi0thrown away. It follows that P0withXi0thrown away
is universal, hence so is P′withXi0thrown away. In particular, P′is universal. Now let
bXpd
i0be the monomial in P′involvingXi0. (Possibly b= 0.) Because P′withXi0thrown
away is universal, one has −b=P′(y1,...,0,...,yn+1)for someyi∈k, where the 0is in
thei0spot. Then (y1,...,1,...,yn+1), where the 1is in thei0spot, is a nontrivial zero of
P′, as required.
25A handy consequence of (weak) permawoundness is connectedn ess.
Proposition 6.2. Letkbe an imperfect ﬁeld. Then every (weakly) permawound k-group
scheme is connected.
Proof. IfUis (weakly) permawound, then so is its ﬁnite étale component groupU/U0by
Proposition 5.4. It therefore suﬃces to show that a nontrivi al ﬁnite étale unipotent group W
over an imperfect ﬁeld kis not (weakly) permawound. We may ﬁlter Wby its derived series
and thereby reduce to the case in which Wis commutative (again using Proposition 5.4),
and we may reduce to the case in which Wisp-torsion by replacing Wby its quotient [p]W
ifWis not already killed by [p]. Since permawound implies weakly so in the commutative
setting, it therefore suﬃces to prove that a nontrivial ﬁnit e étale commutative p-torsion
group is not weakly permawound, for which it is enough to show that it is not quasi-weakly
permawound.
The groupWis the zero locus of some p-polynomial F∈k[X][CGP, Prop.B.1.13]. We
may multiply Fby some element of k×and thereby assume that it is monic. Note that
pd:= deg(F)>1becauseWis nontrivial. Because kis imperfect, Xpdis not universal, so
Wis not quasi-weakly permawound by Proposition 6.1.
We can also now show that there are no interesting (quasi-)we akly permawound groups
over ﬁelds of inﬁnite degree of imperfection, and therefore also no interesting permawound
ones.
Proposition 6.3. Letkbe a ﬁeld of inﬁnite degree of imperfection. Then there is no
nontrivial semiwound unipotent k-groupUthat is either (quasi-)weakly permawound or
permawound.
Proof. Suppose that Uis permawound. Then Uis smooth and connected (Proposition
6.2), hence wound. (This appeal to connectedness is not real ly necessary; it is simply
to put us in the context of [CGP] to avoid having to reprove bey ond the connected case
some of the results state there for wound unipotent groups.) Therefore, if Uis nontrivial,
then it admits a nontrivial commutative wound quotient [CGP , Cor.B.3.3], which is also
permawound by Proposition 5.4 and therefore weakly permawo und. It therefore suﬃces to
treat the (quasi-)weakly permawound assertion.
So letUbe a nontrivial commutative semiwound unipotent k-group scheme. By Propo-
sition 2.7,Uadmits a ﬁltration 0 =U0⊂ ··· ⊂Um=Usuch that each Ui/Ui−1is a
nontrivial group which is the vanishing locus of a reduced p-polynomial Fi, and in partic-
ular semiwound [CGP, Lem.B.1.7, (1) =⇒(2)]. IfUis (quasi-)weakly permawound, then
{F1= 0}is (quasi-weakly) permawound by Proposition 5.5. We are the refore reduced to
showing that the vanishing locus of a reduced p-polynomial F, if nontrivial, is not quasi-
weakly permawound. If it is, then the principal part PofFis universal by Proposition
6.1. Proposition 3.5 then implies that F∈k[X]is of the form aXfor somea∈k×, so
that{F= 0} ⊂Gais the trivial group, in violation of our assumption. This co mpletes the
proof.
26We may now prove a criterion for weak permawoundness.
Proposition 6.4. For eachi= 1,...,m , letFi∈k[X1,...,X ni]be a reduced p-polynomial
with principal part Pi, and letWi:={Fi= 0} ⊂Gnia. Suppose that Uis a commutative
k-group scheme admitting a ﬁltration 0 =U0⊂ ··· ⊂Um=Usuch thatUi/Ui−1≃Wifor
1≤i≤m. ThenUis weakly permawound if and only Piis universal for every 1≤i≤m.
Proof. IfUis weakly permawound, then so are U1andU/U1by Propositions 5.5 and 5.4.
By induction, we conclude that Piis universal for 1< i≤m. Because U1is weakly
permawound, it is quasi-weakly so, hence P1is also universal by Proposition 6.1.
Conversely, suppose that the Piare all universal. Then each Ext1(Ga,Wi)is ﬁnite-
dimensional by Proposition 4.2, hence Ext1(Ga,U)is as well. Now suppose given a quo-
tient group UofU. We must show that Uis quasi-weakly permawound. This is trivial
ifUcontains a copy of Ga, so assume that Uis semiwound. Let V:= ker(U→U).
By Proposition 2.5, both VandUadmit ﬁltrations by hypersurface groups deﬁned by
reducedp-polynomials, and splicing these together yields such a ﬁlt ration onU. Because
Ext1(Ga,U)is ﬁnite-dimensional, Lemma 4.7 ensures that the p-polynomials in this ﬁltra-
tion, and in particular those appearing in the ﬁltration on U, have universal principal part.
Propositions 6.1 and 5.6 then imply that Uis quasi-weakly permawound.
Remark 6.5.The assumption in Proposition 6.4 that the Fibe reduced is necessary. Indeed,
one may begin with a reduced p-polynomial with universal principal part, and by a change
of variables transform it into a (necessarily non-reduced) p-polynomial with non-universal
principal part. For instance, suppose that kis imperfect with ﬁnite degree of imperfection
and letλ1,...,λ rbe ap-basis fork. Then
F:=X0+/summationdisplay
f∈I/parenleftBiggr/productdisplay
i=1λf(i)
i/parenrightBigg
Xp
f∈k[Xf|f∈I],
where0denotes the 0function, is reduced with universal principal part; see exa mple 3.4.
But if one makes the change of variables which ﬁxes Xffor allf/\e}atio\slash= 0but sendsX0toX0+/summationtext
f/ne}ationslash=0Xp
f, thenFis transformed into a p-polynomial with principal part (X0+/summationtext
f/ne}ationslash=0Xp
f)p.
This is not universal because it only takes pth power values.
Corollary 6.6. LetF∈k[X1,...,X n]be a reduced p-polynomial with universal principal
part, and let U:={F= 0} ⊂Gn
a. ThenUis connected.
Proof. This follows from Propositions 6.4 and 6.2.
Proposition 6.7. LetK/kbe a separable extension of ﬁelds of characteristic pand the
same ﬁnite degree of imperfection (for instance, an algebraic separable extension ), and let
Ube a commutative unipotent k-group scheme. Then Uis weakly permawound over kif
and only if it is so over K.
27Proof. Ifkis perfect, then so is Kso we are done by Proposition 5.2. We may therefore
assume that kis imperfect and in particular inﬁnite. First assume that Uis semiwound.
Then by Proposition 2.7, there is a ﬁltration 0 =U0⊂ ··· ⊂Um=Usuch that each Wi:=
Ui/Ui−1is of the form {Fi= 0} ⊂Gniafor some reduced p-polynomial Fi∈k[X1,...,X ni].
The assertion therefore follows from Propositions 6.4 and 3 .6.
Now consider the general case. Let Us⊂Ube the maximal split k-subgroup, and let
Uw:=U/Us. ThenUwisk-semiwound. Further, Uisk- orK-weakly permawound if and
only ifUwis, by Propositions 5.4, 5.3, and 5.6. The proposition there fore reduces to the
semiwound case.
Lemma 6.8. Every extension of Gaby a semiwound smooth commutative unipotent k-
groupUis commutative.
Proof. LetEbe such an extension. The group Uremains semiwound over ks(Proposition
A.3), so we are free to assume that k=ks. Letu∈U(k). The quotient GaofEacts
onUby conjugation, so we obtain a k-scheme map Ga→U,x/mapsto→xux−1. BecauseUis
semiwound, this map is constant, hence uis central in E. Sinceu∈U(k)was arbitrary
andU(k)is dense inU(becauseUis smooth and k=ks), it follows that Uis central in E.
Therefore, the commutator map E×E→U⊂Edescends to a map Ga×Ga→U. Once
again, this map must be constant because Uis semiwound. Thus, Eis commutative.
Proposition 6.9. A smooth commutative unipotent k-group scheme Uis permawound if
and only if it is weakly permawound.
Proof. The only if direction is clear. Conversely, suppose that Uis weakly permawound.
LetUbe a quotient group of U. We must show that any extension EofGabyUcontains
a copy of Ga. IfUcontains such a copy, then this is immediate, so assume that Uis
semiwound. Then Lemma 6.8 implies that Eis commutative, hence contains a copy of Ga
by the weak permawoundness of U.
We now ﬁnally obtain our criterion for permawoundness of smo oth commutative p-
torsion groups.
Theorem 6.10. LetF∈k[X1,...,X n]be a smooth reduced p-polynomial with principal
partP, and letU:={F= 0} ⊂Gn
a. ThenUis permawound if and only if Pis universal.
Proof. Combine Propositions 6.9 and 6.4.
Theorem 6.10 provides us with a wealth of examples of permawo und groups, and in fact
provides all examples of such groups that are commutative an dp-torsion, thanks to [CGP,
Prop.B.1.13, Lem.B.1.7]. We will show that it provides us with enough examples to obtain
the all-important ubiquity property of permawoundness (Th eorem 1.4). Before doing so,
we require a lemma.
28Lemma 6.11. Letkbe a ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection, and let P∈k[X1,...,X n]
be a monogeneous reduced p-polynomial. Then there exist m≥0and a monogeneous p-
polynomial Q∈k[Xn+1,...,X n+m]such thatP+Q∈k[X1,...,X n+m]is reduced and
universal.
Proof. We ﬁrst prove the following claim. Suppose given a reduced mo nogeneousp-polynomial
P∈k[X1,...,X n], and letpN:= max idegXi(P). Assume that a /∈P(k,...,k). Then
F(X1,...,X n,Y) :=P(X1,...,X n)−aYpNis still reduced. Indeed, suppose that (x1,...,x n,y)∈
kn+1is a zero of F. Letpd
i:= degXi(P). Ify/\e}atio\slash= 0, then one obtains
a=P(x1/ypN−d1,...,x n/ypN−dn),
in violation of the assumption that a /∈P(k,...,k). Therefore y= 0, hencexi= 0for alli
by reducedness of P, proving the claim.
Now we prove the lemma. Let rbe the degree of imperfection of k. LetpN:=
maxidegXi(P)as above, and choose a reduced monogeneous p-polynomial of the form
F:=P(X1,...,X n)+Q(Xn+1,...,X n+m)such thatQis homogeneous of degree pNand
such that the quantity φ(F) :=/summationtextn+m
i=1degXi(F)−ris maximized. Proposition 3.5 implies
that there exists such an F. We claim that Fis universal. Indeed, if not, then there is
somea∈knot represented by F. ThenG:=F−aYpNis still reduced and of the above
form, butφ(G)>φ(F), in violation of the maximality of F.
We may now prove the ubiquity of permawoundness.
Theorem 6.12. (Theorem 1.4)Letkbe a ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection. Then for any
smooth commutative p-torsion semiwound unipotent k-groupU, there is an exact sequence
0−→U−→W−→V−→0
withWwound, commutative, p-torsion, and permawound, and Va vector group.
Proof. IfU= 0then the assertion is trivial, so assume that U/\e}atio\slash= 0. By [CGP, Prop.B.1.13,
Lem.B.1.7], U≃ {F= 0} ⊂Gn
afor some nonzero reduced p-polynomial F∈k[X1,...,X n].
LetPbe the principal part of F. By Lemma 6.11, there exist m≥0and a monogeneous
p-polynomial Q∈k[Xn+1,...,X n+m]such thatP+Q∈k[X1,...,X n+m]is reduced and
universal. Let W:={F+Q= 0} ⊂Gn+m
a. ThenWis permawound by Theorem 6.10,
therefore connected by Proposition 6.2, and it is wound by [C GP, Lem.B.1.7, (1) =⇒(2)].
Furthermore, the map W→Gm
a,(X1,...,X n+m)/mapsto→(Xn+1,...,X n+m)is surjective with
kernelU.
7 The groups Rk1/p/k(αp)andV
In this section we study certain unipotent groups which will play a fundamental role in the
study of permawound groups. In particular, we study the grou psRk1/p/k(αp)andV(see
Deﬁnition 7.3) which appear in the rigidity theorem 1.5.
29Lemma 7.1. Letkbe a separably closed ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection r. ForP∈
k[X1,...,X pnr]a reducedp-polynomial that is homogeneous of degree pn, and0/\e}atio\slash=L∈
k[X1,...,X pnr]that is homogeneous of degree 1, consider the p-polynomial FP,L:=P+L.
Then for any two such pairs (P1,L1),(P2,L2), there exists c∈k×such thatcFP2,L2is
obtainable from FP1,L1by a linear change of coordinates in the Xi.
Note that a homogeneous p-polynomial P∈k[X1,...,X pnr]of degreepnover a ﬁeld of
degree of imperfection ris reduced precisely when it is universal (Proposition 3.5) .
Proof. Letλ1,...,λ r∈kform ap-basis fork. BecausePis universal, its coeﬃcients form
akpn-basis ofk. Any two such bases are related by an invertible kpn-linear change of
variables. It follows that any such Pmay be transformed by a linear change of variables
intoQ:=/summationtext
f∈In(/producttextr

f∈k[Xf|f∈In]. It therefore suﬃces to show that the
FQ,LasLvaries over the nonzero linear forms in k[Xf|f∈In]are all related by linear
changes of variables as in the lemma, and one may simply show t hat they are all so related
toF:=FQ,L0, whereL0:=X0, with0∈Indenoting the 0function.

Because the λiarep-independent, the coeﬃcient of Ypn
g0on the right side is nonzero (because
the summand with f=g0is nonzero). Because k=ks, it follows that the above equation

We claim that this is invertible. Indeed, using (7.3), one se es that it transforms QintocQ.
That is, the pnth power of the linear change of variables (af,g)transforms one kpn-basis
forkinto another, hence this change of variables is invertible. We have also seen that it
transforms QintocQ. We claim that it transforms L0intocL. Assuming this, we have
obtained a linear change of variables sending FQ,L0intocFQ,L.
To obtain the claim, we ﬁrst compute a0,g. Using the expression (7.2) for c, and equating

a0,g=cβg.
Corollary 7.2. Letkbe a separably closed ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection r. Then the
k-groups{P+L= 0} ⊂Gpr
aare allk-isomorphic as Pvaries over all reduced homogeneous
p-polynomials of degree pnink[X1,...,X pnr], andLvaries over the nonzero homogeneous
degree1polynomials in the same ring.
Deﬁnition 7.3. Letkbe a ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection r. For any homogeneous p-
polynomials P,L∈k[X1,...,X pr],Pof degreepandLof degree 1, such thatPis universal
(equivalently, reduced) and L/\e}atio\slash= 0, letVP,L:={P+L= 0} ⊂Gpr
a. Whenkis separably
closed, the VP,Lare allk-isomorphic by Corollary 7.2, and we denote the common k-group
they deﬁne by V/k, or just Vwhenkis clear from context.
31Note that VP,Lis smooth and connected. Indeed, one readily checks that it b ecomes
isomorphic to Gpr−1
aoverk1/p. Note also that (VP,L/k)K≃V/Kfor any separable exten-
sionK/kthat is separably closed and has the same degree of imperfect ion ask. Indeed,
this follows from Proposition 3.6(ii).
The other group which appears in the ﬁltration of Theorem 1.5 isRk1/p/k(αp). Note
that this is a totally nonsmooth group: Rk1/p/k(αp)(ks) = 0 . It is useful to write down
an equation for it. Choose a p-basisλ1,...,λ rfork. Then the elements/producttextr
i=1λf(i)/p

By applying a linear change of variables, this is the same as th e group deﬁned by the
equationP= 0for any homogeneous degree puniversalp-polynomial P∈k[X1,...,X pr].
We record this fact for later use.
Proposition 7.4. For a ﬁeldkof characteristic pand ﬁnite degree of imperfection r, one
hasRk1/p/k(αp)≃ {P= 0}for anyP∈k[X1,...,X pr]which is universal and homogeneous
of degreep.
More generally, we shall require the following description of the groups Rk1/pn/k(αp).
Proposition 7.5. For a ﬁeldkof characteristic pand ﬁnite degree of imperfection r, one
has for any n>0thatRk1/pn/k(αp)≃/parenleftBig

Each summand in the internal sum above is deﬁned over k, so that the above equa-
tion is equivalent to the group given by the product over g∈In−1of the group Ug⊂

a described by the vanishing of the internal sum. But the map f/mapsto→(f(i)−
g(i))/pn−1is a bijection between those f∈Inthat are ≡g(modpn−1)andI1. Thus we
ﬁnd that Rk1/pn/k(αp)≃UIn−1, whereU⊂GI1ais the group

By Proposition 7.4, one has U≃Rk1/p/k(αp). Since #In−1=pr(n−1), the proposition
follows.
The equations for VP,Land forRk1/p/k(αp), in conjunction with Theorem 6.10 and
Proposition 6.4, imply the following result.
Proposition 7.6. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pof ﬁnite degree of imperfection. Then
VP,Lis permawound, and Rk1/p/k(αp)is weakly permawound.
Here is a useful property of VP,LandRk1/p/k(αp).
Proposition 7.7. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pof ﬁnite degree of imperfection r,
and letUbe either VP,LorRk1/p/k(αp). Then for any nonzero closed k-subgroup scheme
0/\e}atio\slash=H⊂U, thek-groupU/His a vector group.
Proof. The argument given here is inspired by one given in the proof o f [Tot, Ex.9.10].
BecauseU/H is commutative and p-torsion, it is a vector group if and only if it is split.
[CGP, Th.B.2.5]. Since this is insensitive to passing to ks, we are free to assume that kis
separably closed. Similarly, any quotient of a power of Gais still a power of Ga(because it
is still commutative, p-torsion, and split unipotent). To prove the lemma for H, therefore,
it suﬃces to prove it for a nonzero k-subgroup of H. Ifker(FH/k) = 0, thenHis ﬁnite étale
and sincek=ks,Hcontains ak-subgroup isomorphic to Z/pZ. Otherwise, ker(FH/k)is
nonzero and is killed by Frobenius and Verschiebung, hence i s a power of αp, hence contains
a copy ofαp. We may therefore assume that H≃αporZ/pZ.
By deﬁnition, V⊂Gpr
a, and we may consider Rk1/p/k(αp)as lying in Gpr
avia the
equation (7.6). We claim that for any line L⊂Gpr
athrough the origin, the intersection
U∩Lis a ﬁnitek-group scheme of order ≤p. (In fact, it is of order p.) We ﬁrst note that
U∩Lis ﬁnite. Indeed, if not, then L⊂U, an impossibility as Uis semiwound by [CGP,
Lem.B.1.7, (1) =⇒(2)]. NowU⊂Gpr
ais deﬁned by an equation of the form
F= 0
for someF∈k[X1,...,X pr]of degreep. An invertible linear change of variables in the
Xiyields an equation of the same form. After making such a chang e of variables, we
may assume that Lis the line X2=···=Xpr= 0. ThenU∩Lis the subgroup of
33Ga= Spec(k[X1])deﬁned by a (nonzero, because U∩L/\e}atio\slash=L) polynomial of degree ≤p.
That is,U∩Lis a ﬁnite group scheme of order ≤p, as claimed.
Now choose a line Lsuch thatH⊂L. ForH=αp, we simply choose the line whose
Lie algebra coincides with H, while for H=Z/pZ, we choose an element 0/\e}atio\slash=x∈H(k)
and then choose Lcontainingx. ThenU∩L⊃His of order ≤p, hence coincides with H.
Thus we have an inclusion of k-groups
U/H=U/(U∩L)֒→Gpr
a/L≃Gpr−1
a.
Sincedim(U/H) =pr−1 = dim( Gpr−1
a), this inclusion must actually be an isomorphism:
U/H≃Gpr−1
a. This completes the proof of the proposition.
Corollary 7.8. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pand ﬁnite degree of imperfection r, and
letU=VP,LorRk1/p/k(αp). Then the only quasi-weakly permawound k-subgroups of Uare
0andU.
Proof. If0/subsetnoteqlH/subsetnoteqlU, thenUis a semiwound extension of the nontrivial k-groupU/H –
which is a vector group by Proposition 7.7 – by H. The preimage in Uof any copy of Ga
insideU/Hthen yields a semiwound extension of GabyH.
Lemma 7.9. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pof ﬁnite degree of imperfection. Then there
is no nonzero k-homomorphism Rk1/pn/k(αp)→VP,L.
Proof. Due to Proposition 7.5, it suﬃces to treat the case n= 1. Letφ: Rk1/p/k(αp)→
VP,Lbe ak-homomorphism. Because VP,Lis semiwound [CGP, Lem.B.1.7, (1) =⇒(2)],
Proposition 7.7 implies that φis either 0or injective. If φis injective, then for dimension
reasons it is an isomorphism. But Rk1/p/k(αp)is totally nonsmooth while VP,Lis smooth
and nontrivial, so the two groups cannot be isomorphic. Henc eφ= 0.
8 Preparations for rigidity
In this section we lay the groundwork for the proof of the rigi dity property 1.5 of perma-
wound groups. The general strategy for proving rigidity is a s follows. The key is to show
that for any nontrivial smooth commutative semiwound unipo tentk-group (not necessar-
ily permawound), there is a nonzero ks-homomorphism to V. We may assume that kis
ﬁnitely generated over Fp, and in that case we note that (for any P,Las in Deﬁnition
7.3)Hom(U,VP,L)is the automorphism functor of the trivial extension of UbyVP,L. In
particular, one obtains an exact sequence
0−→H1(Gal(ks/k),Homks(U,VP,L))−→Ext1
k(U,VP,L)−→Ext1
ks(U,VP,L).
In order to show that Homks(U,V)/\e}atio\slash= 0, therefore, it suﬃces to construct a nontrivial
extension of UbyVP,Loverkthat splits over ks. In this section we prove two fundamental
34ingredients that will allow us to accomplish this in §9. Firs t, we consider the exact sequence
deﬁning VP,L
0−→VP,L−→Gpr
aP+L− − −→Ga−→0,
and show that the induced map Hom(U,Gpr
a)→Hom(U,Ga)is surjective over ks(Lemma
8.2). This will allow us to show that certain extensions of UbyVoverksare trivial.
Second, we will show that, over kand for suitably chosen PandL, there are nontrivial
extensions of Z/pZbyVP,Lthat trivialize over ks(Proposition 8.7). This will allow us to
construct suitable nontrivial extensions of UbyVP,Loverk.
We begin with the following lemma, which we will require in th e proof of the ﬁrst
ingredient mentioned above.
Lemma 8.1. Letkbe a ﬁeld with p-basis{λs}s∈S, and letQ∈k[X1,...,X n]be a homo-
geneousp-polynomial of degree pd. Then there is an invertible linear change of variables
Lin theXisuch thatQ◦L=/summationtextn
i=1ciXpd
ihas the following property. Let Ibe the set of
ﬁnitely-supported functions S→ {0,...,pd−1}. Then for any 1≤j <i≤nwithcj/\e}atio\slash= 0,
one hascic−1

Proof. We prove by induction on m≤nthe existence of a change of variables such that
thef= 0coeﬃcient in the expansion of cic−1
jvanishes whenever j≤m,j <i, andcj/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Them= 0case is trivial, so assume that m >0. We may assume by induction that the
f= 0term in the expansion of cic−1
jvanishes when j < m ,j < i, andcj/\e}atio\slash= 0. For each

i. Then we claim
that thef= 0term in the expansion of bib−1
jvanishes whenever j≤m,j <i, andbj/\e}atio\slash= 0,
which will complete the induction.
To prove the claim, we may suppose that bj/\e}atio\slash= 0, as otherwise there is nothing to prove.
We ﬁrst compute that
bi=/braceleftBigg

It remains to treat the case j=m. For allm<i≤n, one has, using (8.2) and (8.1),
bib−1
m= (ci−cmapd
0,i,m)c−1

The coeﬃcient of/producttext

sin the above expansion vanishes, so the induction is complet e.
The following lemma and Corollary 8.3 – which are the key prop erties that make the
group Vfundamental – will allow us to show that certain extensions s plit overks.
Lemma 8.2. Letkbe a separably closed ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection r, and let
F:Gpr
a→Ga,F:=P+Lfor anyP,L∈k[X1,...,X pr]withPandLhomogeneous, P
of degreepandLof degree 1, such that Pis universal (equivalently, reduced) and L/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Finally, let Ube a commutative p-torsion semiwound smooth unipotent k-group scheme.
Then the map φ: Hom(U,Gpr
a)→Hom(U,Ga)induced byFis surjective.
Proof. By Lemma 7.1, it suﬃces to prove the lemma for a particular choi ce ofPandL.
We choose a p-basis{λ1,...,λ r}ofk. Take
P:=/summationdisplay
f∈I1/parenleftBiggr/productdisplay

f∈k[Xf|f∈I1]
andL:=−X0. The group Uis isomorphic to {G= 0} ⊂Gm
afor some reduced (nonzero)
p-polynomial G∈k[Y1,...,Y m][CGP, Prop.B.1.13, Lem.B.1.7]. Let us ﬁrst prove the
lemma under the assumption that the principal part QofGis homogeneous, say of degree
pd. Ifd= 0, then reducedness of Gimplies that U= 0, and there is nothing to prove, so
assume that d>0. Note that a linear change of variables in the Yjpreserves the property
that the degree pdpart ofGis reduced, so in particular all of the variables still appea r in it.
Lemma 8.1 therefore allows us to make a linear change of varia bles in the Yjand thereby
assume that

By induction, this last expression is equivalent modulo im(φ)toγ0, which proves the claim.
Everyk-homomorphism U→Gais ap-polynomial in the Yj, as follows from the anti-
equivalence of categories between groups killed by Verschi ebung and k[F]-modules [DG,
Ch.IV, §3, Cor.6.7], so (8.5) implies that every such homomo rphism is equivalent modulo
im(φ)to ak-linear combination of the Yj. It therefore suﬃces to show that every such
combination lies in im(φ). Fixr∈kand1≤j≤m. Write

For any/vector r:= (r1,...,rm)T∈km, let/vector rpdenote the vector obtained by raising each entry of

α(/vector r) :=B/vector r−F(/vector rp)·/vector1∈km.
Add (8.9) with r=rjoverj= 1,...,m to obtain
α(/vector r) :=α(/vector r)·/vectorY∈im(φ).
Consider the k-group homomorphism α:Gm
a→Gm
adeﬁned by the formula /vector r/mapsto→α(/vector r).
Because the Fterm involves polynomials in the rp
j, this map has diﬀerential Bwhich is
invertible. It is therefore an étale homomorphism, hence su rjective. Because kis separably

Letβ:U→Gabe ak-homomorphism. We wish to show that βlifts to a homomorphism

38Corollary 8.3. Letkbe a separably closed ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection, a nd let
Ube a smooth commutative p-torsion semiwound unipotent k-group. Then every p-torsion
extension of UbyVsplits.
Proof. Write VasVP,Lfor somePandLso that we have an exact sequence
0−→Vi− −→Gpr
aP+L− − −→Ga−→0. (8.10)
LetEbe ap-torsion extension of UbyV. Theni∗E∈Ext1(U,Gpr
a)is smooth and
p-torsion, hence has vanishing Verschiebung map. It follows from Proposition 2.4 that
i∗(E)splits, hence Elies in the image of the connecting map Hom(U,Ga)→Ext1(U,V)
associated to (8.10). Then Lemma 8.2 implies that Eis trivial as an extension.
Recall that the k-linear action on Gainduces ak-linear action on Ext1(Ga,F)for any
fppf abelian sheaf Foverk. Our next task is to compute Ext1(Ga,VP,L). Letrbe the
degree of imperfection of k. We have the exact sequence
0−→VP,Li− −→Gpr
aF:=P+L− −−−− −→ Ga−→0, (8.11)
which induces a connecting map δ: Hom(Ga,Ga)→Ext1(Ga,VP,L).
Proposition 8.4. Letkbe a ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection. The above map k→
Ext1(Ga,VP,L),α/mapsto→δ(α·Id)is ak-linear isomorphism that is functorial in separable
extensionsK/kof the same degree of imperfection.
Proof.Premains universal over Kas in the lemma thanks to Proposition 3.6, and func-
toriality follows from the functoriality of the connecting map, so it only remains to show
that the map is a k-linear isomorphism. The k-linearity follows from the deﬁnition of the
k-action on Ext1(Ga,VP,L). To prove that the map is an isomorphism, we ﬁrst check that
it is injective, which is equivalent to the assertion that it is nonzero. So it suﬃces to show
thatδ(Id)/\e}atio\slash= 0– that is, the sequence (8.11) does not split. If it did, then w e would obtain
an isomorphism Gpr
a≃VP,L×Ga, hence a surjection Gpr
a։VP,L, in violation of the
woundness of the latter group. Thus the map is injective.
It remains to prove surjectivity. So suppose given E∈Ext1(Ga,VP,L). ThenEhas
vanishing Verschiebung by Lemma 2.6, hence (referring to th e exact sequence (8.11)) so
doesi∗(E)∈Ext1(Ga,Gpr
a), hence splits by Proposition 2.4. It follows that Elies in
the image of the connecting map Hom(Ga,Ga)→Ext1(Ga,VP,L), soE=δ(φ)for some
φ∈Hom(Ga,Ga).
We are free to modify φbyF∗(χ)for anyχ∈Hom(Ga,Gpr
a), and we claim that any
elementφ∈Hom(Ga,Ga)is equivalent modulo F∗(Hom(Ga,Gpr
a))to ak-multiple of the
identity. We have that φ∈k[T]is ap-polynomial, which we may assume to be homogeneous.
We then prove the claim by induction on deg(φ), the degree 1case (or the case φ= 0)
being trivial. So assume that deg(φ) =pn>1. BecausePis universal and homogeneous
39of degreep, we may write φ=P(ψ1,...,ψ pr)for somep-polynomials ψi∈k[T]either
vanishing or of degree pn−1. Then
φ≡ −L(ψ1,...,ψ pr) (modF∗(Hom(Ga,Gpr
a))),
and the latter homomorphism either vanishes or has degree pn−1, so we are done by induc-
tion.
An important step in the proof of Theorem 1.5 entails proving that the groups VP,Lfor
suitable choice of PandLhave nonvanishing cohomology when Kis inﬁnite and ﬁnitely
generated over Fp. This will allow us to construct suitable nontrivial extens ions of smooth
unipotent groups by VP,L. We ﬁrst prove the following analogous result over fraction ﬁelds
of complete regular local rings.
Proposition 8.5. LetRbe a complete r-dimensional regular local ring of characteristic
pwith maximal ideal m, fraction ﬁeld K, and perfect residue ﬁeld R/m. By the Cohen
structure theorem, we may choose a subﬁeld k⊂Rwhich maps isomorphically onto the
residue ﬁeld. Choose elements λ1,...,λ r∈R, and for each iletci∈kbe the unique
element such that λi−ci∈m. Assume that the elements λi−ciare generators for m. Then
theλiform ap-basis forK. LetP:=/summationtext

fandL:=−Xcp−1, where
cp−1denotes the constant function with value p−1. Assume that H1(k,Z/pZ)/\e}atio\slash= 0. Then
H1(K,VP,L)/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Proof. The continuous k-algebra map k/llbracketX1,...,X r/rrbracket→R,Xi/mapsto→λi−ci, is an isomorphism.
It follows that the λi−ciform ap-basis fork, hence – because c∈k=kp– so too do
theλi. We identify Rwithk/llbracketX1,...,X r/rrbracketandλiwithXi+ci. Order the group G:=Zr
lexicographically. This makes Zrinto an ordered abelian group. Consider the ring k/llbracketTG/rrbracket
of Hahn series with value group G. Recall that this is the ring of formal power series
f=/summationtext
g∈GcgTgwithcg∈ksuch that the set {g∈G|cg/\e}atio\slash= 0}is well-ordered. Then
R⊂k/llbracketTG/rrbracketviaXe1
1...Xerr/mapsto→T(e1,...,er), henceK⊂k/llbracketTG/rrbracket. Forf∈k/llbracketTG/rrbracket, we deﬁne the
residue offto be the coeﬃcient of X−1
1...X−1
rin the expansion of f.
Using the exact sequence
0−→VP,L−→GI
aF:=P+L− −−−− −→ Ga−→0,
we see that the nonvanishing of H1(K,VP,L)is equivalent to the non-surjectivity of the map
KI→Kinduced by F. To show that this map is not surjective, we compute the resid ue
ofF((αf)f)for any(αf)f∈KI. More generally, we compute this residue for any (αf)f∈
k/llbracketTG/rrbracketI. The only term in P((αf)f) =/summationtext

g∈GagTg,
then the residue of P((αf)f)isap

F((αf)f) = (P+L)((αf)f)is therefore ap
g−1−ag−1∈k. By assumption, H1(k,Z/pZ)/\e}atio\slash= 0,
40so the Artin-Schreier map k→k,x/mapsto→xp−xis not surjective. For any element β∈knot
in the image of Artin-Schreier, the element β(λ1−c1)−1...(λr−cr)−1∈Kdoes not lie in
F(KI), so we conclude that H1(K,VP,L)/\e}atio\slash= 0.
As a corollary, we obtain the following result. Later we will prove the much stronger
Theorem 1.6.
Corollary 8.6. LetKbe a ﬁeld ﬁnitely generated over Fp, and letλ1,...,λ r∈Kbe a
p-basis. Also let
P:=/summationdisplay
f∈I/parenleftBiggr/productdisplay
i=1λf(i)

f
andL:=−Xcp−1∈k[Xf|f∈I], wherecp−1∈Iis the constant function with value p−1.
ThenH1(K,VP,L)/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Proof. WriteKas the function ﬁeld of a smooth integral Fp-schemeXof ﬁnite type.
ShrinkingXif necessary, we may assume that the dλifreely generate the sheaf Ω1
X/Fp. Let
x∈Xbe a closed point, and let Rbe the completion of OX,x. Letκ⊂Rbe the subﬁeld
mapping isomorphically onto the residue ﬁeld (it is unique b ecause the residue ﬁeld is ﬁnite),
and for each i, letci∈κbe the element such that λi−cilies in the maximal ideal mof
R. Because the dλigenerate Ω1
X/Fp, the elements λi−cigenerate m. LetKx:= Frac(R).
Proposition 8.5 implies that H1(Kx,VP,L)/\e}atio\slash= 0. Therefore the map FKx=P+L:KI
x→Kx
is not surjective, and we need to prove the same with Kxreplaced by K. Letβ∈Kxbe
an element not lying in the image of FKx. BecauseFis smooth, im(FKx)contains an open
neighborhood of 0∈Kx, so an open neighborhood of βis disjoint from im(FKx). Because
the mapK→Kxhas dense image, it follows that there is an element of Knot in the image
ofFKx, hence not in the image of FK.
Proposition 8.7. Letkbe a ﬁnitely generated extension ﬁeld of Fp,λ1,...,λ r∈ka
p-basis. Let

Then the map Ext1
k(Z/pZ,VP,L)→Ext1
ks(Z/pZ,VP,L)is not injective.
Proof. Consider the exact sequence
0−→Z/pZ−→Ga℘− −→Ga−→0,
where℘is the Artin-Schreier map x/mapsto→xp−x. This induces for any extension ﬁeld Kof
kan inclusion Ext1
K(Ga,VP,L)/℘∗(Ext1
K(Ga,VP,L))֒→Ext1
K(Z/pZ,VP,L). We claim that
the former group is nontrivial when K=k, but vanishes when K=ks, which will prove
41the proposition. Via Proposition 8.4, when K/kis separable algebraic, we may identify
Ext1
K(Ga,VP,L)K-linearly with Kviaφ:α/mapsto→δ(α·Id)in the notation of Proposition
8.4. Write ℘=F−I, whereFis the Frobenius isogeny and Iis the identity. Then
F∗(δ(α·Id)) =δ(αF). We seek to write this in the form δ(β·Id)for someβ∈K.
Writeα=P((γf)f∈I)withγf∈K. Then
αF=P((γf·Id)f∈I)≡γcp−1·Id (mod ( P+L)∗(Hom(Ga,GI
a))),
soδ(αF) =δ(γcp−1·Id). In the map ℘∗
K: Ext1
K(Ga,VP,L)→Ext1
K(Ga,VP,L), we identify
the source with KIviaφ◦Pand the target with Kviaφ. Then the induced map ℘∗:KI→
Kis−L−P, hence the cokernel is isomorphic to H1(K,VP,L). This is nonzero when K=k
by Corollary 8.6 and vanishes when K=ksbecause VP,Lis smooth.
9 Rigidity
In this section we apply the results of §8 to prove the crucial rigidity property of permawound
groups (Theorem 9.6), and we also give a version of the rigidi ty property over general, not
necessarily separably closed ﬁelds of ﬁnite degree of imper fection (Theorem 9.10).
Lemma 9.1. Letkbe a ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection r. For any P,L, the map
Ext2
k(Ga,VP,L)→Ext2
ks(Ga,VP,L)is injective.
Proof. We have the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence
Ei,j
2= Hi(Gal(ks/k),Extj
ks(Ga,VP,L)) =⇒Exti+j
k(Ga,VP,L).
It suﬃces to prove that E2,0
2=E1,1
2= 0. The group E2,0
2vanishes because VP,Lis semi-
wound, so Homks(Ga,VP,L) = 0. ForE1,1
2, Proposition 8.4 provides a functorial – hence
Galois-equivariant – isomorphism Ext1
ks(Ga,VP,L)≃ks. It follows that
H1(Gal(ks/k),Ext1
ks(Ga,VP,L)) = 0.
Lemma 9.2. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic p. Then any smooth non-split unipotent
k-groupUadmits a nontrivial smooth semiwound commutative p-torsion quotient.
Proof. IfUis not connected, then it admits a nontrivial ﬁnite étale quo tient, which admits a
nontrivial ﬁnite étale commutative p-torsion quotient. If, on the other hand, Uis connected,
then by [CGP, Th.B.3.4], there is a normal split unipotent k-subgroupUsplit/triangleleftequalUsuch
thatU/Usplitis wound. We may therefore assume that Uis a nontrivial wound group.
Then [CGP, Cor.B.3.3] implies that Uadmits a nontrivial wound commutative p-torsion
quotient.
We are now ready to prove the following fundamental result, w hich is of signiﬁcant
interest in its own right and is also the key to proving Theore m 1.5.
42Theorem 9.3. Letkbe a separably closed ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection r>0, and
letUbe a smooth nonsplit unipotent k-group scheme. Then Hom(U,V)/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Proof. By Lemma 9.2, we may assume that Uis semiwound, commutative, and p-torsion.
Choose a ﬁnitely generated extension ﬁeld K/Fpof degree of imperfection rsuch thatUis
deﬁned over Kandk/Kis separable. We may assume that k=Ks. By [CGP, Lem.B.1.10],
there is a ﬁnite étale K-group scheme E⊂Usuch thatU/Eis a vector group. Replacing
Kby a ﬁnite separable extension, therefore, we may assume tha t there exists for some
m>0,n≥0an exact sequence of K-group schemes
0−→(Z/pZ)m−→Uf− −→Gn
a−→0. (9.1)
Choose ap-basisλ1,...,λ rofK, letP:=/summationtext

Xp
fandL:=−Xcp−1∈
k[Xf|f∈I], wherecp−1∈Iis the constant function with value p−1. Because the
automorphism functor of the trivial extension of UbyVP,LisHom(U,VP,L), one has an
exact sequence
0−→H1(Gal(Ks/K),HomKs(U,VP,L))−→Ext1
K(U,VP,L)−→Ext1
Ks(U,VP,L)(9.2)
In order to show that HomKs(U,V) = Hom Ks(U,VP,L)is nonzero, therefore, it suﬃces to
show that the ﬁnal map above is not injective.
Using Proposition 8.7, choose a nonzero element α∈Ext1
K((Z/pZ)m,VP,L)that dies
overKs. The image of αunder the connecting map Ext1
K((Z/pZ)m,VP,L)→Ext2(Gn
a,V)
then also dies over Ks, so by Lemma 9.1, αlifts to an element – necessarily nonzero –
β∈Ext1
K(U,VP,L), and we claim that βdies overKs, which will complete the proof that
the ﬁnal map in (9.2) is not injective, hence of the theorem.
SinceαKs= 0,βKslifts to an element γ∈Ext1
Ks(Gn
a,VP,L). The extension γis
represented by a scheme by the eﬀectivity of fpqc descent for relatively aﬃne schemes.
This group scheme has vanishing Verschiebung by Lemma 2.6. I t follows that the group
scheme corresponding to βKshas vanishing Verschiebung, hence is p-torsion, so βKsvanishes
by Corollary 8.3.
Our next task is to use Theorem 9.3 to construct a ﬁltration on permawound groups as
in Theorem 1.5. We ﬁrst require the following proposition.
Proposition 9.4. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pand of ﬁnite degree of imperfec-
tion, and let Ube a commutative unipotent k-group scheme that is not smooth. Then
Hom(U,Rk1/p/k(αp))/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Proof. LetV:= (Ukperf)red, a smooth kperf-subgroup scheme of Ukperf. ThenV/\e}atio\slash=Ukperf
becauseUis not smooth. Therefore, Ukperf/Vis a nontrivial inﬁnitesimal unipotent kperf-
group scheme. Such a group admits a ﬁltration by nontrivial g roups with vanishing
Frobenius and Verschiebung. By [DG, Ch.IV, §3, Cor.6.7], the refore,Ukperf/Vadmits
43a surjective homomorphism onto (αp)kperf. We thus obtain a nonzero kperf-homomorphism
Ukperf→(αp)kperf. This descends to a homomorphism Uk1/pn→(αp)k1/pnfor somen>0.
We therefore obtain a nonzero k-homomorphism U→Rk1/pn/k(αp). (The assumption that
khas ﬁnite degree of imperfection is used here to ensure that k1/pn/kis a ﬁnite extension,
and hence that the Weil restriction is (represented by) a sch eme.) We are then done by
Proposition 7.5.
Before proving Theorem 1.5, we prove the analogous statement for weakly permawound
groups.
Theorem 9.5. Letkbe a separably closed ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection r>0, and
letUbe a semiwound weakly permawound unipotent k-group scheme. Then Uadmits a
ﬁltration 0 =U0⊂U1⊂ ··· ⊂Um=Usuch that, for each 1≤j≤m, eitherUi/Ui−1≃V
orUi/Ui−1≃Rk1/p/k(αp).
Proof. We proceed by induction on dim(U). IfU= 0, then we are done, so assume that
U/\e}atio\slash= 0. IfUis not smooth, then Proposition 9.4 provides a nonzero k-homomorphism
U→Rk1/p/k(αp). If, on the other hand, Uis smooth, then Theorem 9.3 provides a
nonzerok-homomorphism U→V. LettingWdenote either VorRk1/p/k(αp), depending
on whether Uis smooth or not, we therefore have a nonzero k-homomorphism f:U→W.
Proposition 5.4 implies that im(f)is weakly permawound, hence quasi-weakly permawound,
so by Corollary 7.8, fis surjective. Further, ker(f)is weakly permawound by Proposition
5.5, so we are done by induction.
Theorem 9.6. (Theorem 1.5)Letkbe a separably closed ﬁeld of ﬁnite degree of imperfection
r >0, and letUbe a wound permawound unipotent k-group scheme. Then Uadmits a
ﬁltration 1 =U0/triangleleftequalU1/triangleleftequal···/triangleleftequalUm=Usuch that, for each 1≤i≤m, eitherUi/Ui−1≃V
orUi/Ui−1≃Rk1/p/k(αp).
Proof. We proceed by induction on dim(U), the0-dimensional case being trivial. So assume
thatU/\e}atio\slash= 1. By [CGP, Cor.B.3.3], there is a nontrivial smooth central (an d evenp-torsion)
k-subgroupU′⊂Usuch thatU/U′is wound. Then U/U′is permawound by Proposition
5.4, andU′is weakly permawound by Proposition 5.5, therefore permawo und by Proposition
6.9. By induction, therefore, we may assume that Uis commutative, and we are then done
by Theorem 9.5.
We now prove a version of Theorems 9.5 and 9.6 over a ﬁeld that i s not separably closed.
In this case Umay not admit a ﬁltration by the groups Rk1/p/k(αp)andVP,Lfor varying P
andL. Instead, the best we can do is to obtain a ﬁltration by Rk1/p/k(αp)andks/k-forms
of powers of a ﬁxed VP,L. (WhichPandLwe choose does not matter, thanks to Corollary
7.2.) As we will see, such powers are classiﬁed by Galois repr esentations of koverFp. The
key fact that we require is the following.
44Proposition 9.7. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pand of ﬁnite degree of imperfection
r>0. Then for any P,Las in Deﬁnition 7.3,End(VP,L) =Fp.
Proof. We may extend scalars to ksand thereby assume that kis separably closed. It then
suﬃces by Corollary 7.2 to prove the proposition for a single choice ofPandL. Let us
take the usual P: choose a p-basisλ1,...,λ rofk, and take P:=/summationtext

andL:=−X0, and letF:=P+L. An endomorphism ψ:V→Vis a collection of
homomorphisms Gf:V→Gaforf∈Isuch that
F((Gf)f∈I) = 0. (9.3)
By [Rosengarten2, Prop.6.4], each Gfis of the form Qf((Xg)g∈I)for somep-polynomial
Qf∈k[Yf|f∈I]withdegY0(Qf)≤1. We claim that each Qfis linear. Indeed, suppose to
the contrary that this is not the case, and ﬁx g0,f0∈Isuch that 1<pd:= degYg0(Qf0) =
maxf∈IdegYg0(Qf). The coeﬃcient of Xpd+1
g0on the left side of (9.3) is P((af)f∈I)for some
af∈k, not all 0, and is in particular nonzero because Pis reduced. Since each Qfhas
degree≤1inY0, the left side of (9.3) has degree ≤pinX0. Using the equation F= 0
onVto eliminate the Xp
0term leaves the coeﬃcient of Xpd+1
g0unchanged because d >0.
This then yields an equation on Vofp-polynomials in the Xfwith degree ≤1inX0.
By the uniqueness aspect of [Rosengarten2, Prop.6.4], it fol lows that this is an identity of
polynomials (and not just of functions on V). Since the coeﬃcient of Xpd+1
g0is nonzero, this
is a contradiction. We conclude that each Qfis linear, as claimed.
WriteQf=/summationtext

Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pand ﬁnite degree of imperfection r. For any ﬁnite-
dimensional Fp-vector space W, one may deﬁne W⊗VP,Lto be the tensor product of the
constant Fp-vector space scheme Wwith the Fp-vector space scheme VP,L. When W=Fn
p,
thenW⊗V=Vncanonically. In general, a non-canonical choice of isomorp hismW≃Fn
p
yields an isomorphism W⊗VP,L≃Vn
P,L. The construction W/mapsto→W⊗VP,Lis covariant in
W. One has the following proposition, which is essentially a f ormal consequence of results
we have already proven.
Proposition 9.8. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pand ﬁnite degree of imperfection
r >0, and let Wbe a ﬁnite-dimensional Fp-vector space. The quasi-weakly permawound
k-subgroup schemes of W⊗VP,Lare exactly those of the form U⊗VP,LforU⊂Wan
Fp-vector subspace.
Proof. Subgroups of the given form are isomorphic to powers of VP,L, hence permawound.
To see that these are the only such subgroups, we proceed by in duction on dim(W), the
0-dimensional case being trivial. So assume that W/\e}atio\slash= 0. We may assume that W=Fn
p.
LetU⊂Vn
P,Lbe quasi-weakly permawound. If Vi:={0}i−1×VP,L×{0}n−i⊂Ufor all
1≤i≤n, thenU=Vn
P,L, so assume that there is some isuch that Vi/\e}atio\slash⊂U.
Letπi:Vn
P,L→Vn−1
P,Ldenote the projection away from the ith factor. The exact
sequence
0−→U∩Vi−→Uπi
− −→Vn−1
P,L,
together with Proposition 5.5, shows that U∩Viis quasi-weakly permawound. Because
U∩Vi/\e}atio\slash=Viby assumption, Corollary 7.8 implies that U∩Vi= 0. The map πi:U→Vn−1
P,L
is therefore injective. By induction, πi(U) =W⊗VP,Lfor some Fp-subspace W⊂Fn−1
p.
Letπi:Vn
P,L→VP,Ldenote projection onto the ith factor. The composition W⊗VP,L∼− →
Uπi− →VP,Lis, thanks to Proposition 9.7, induced by an Fp-linear map f:W→Fp. If
U⊂W×Fpis the graph of f, thenU=U⊗VP,L.
Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pand ﬁnite degree of imperfection r, and ﬁx a choice of P
andLas in Deﬁnition 7.3. Thanks to Proposition 9.7, we have an iso morphism – canonical
46up to a universal choice of sign – between the group Homcts(Gal(ks/k),GLn(Fp))of continu-
ousn-dimensional Galois representations of koverFpand the group H1(Gal(ks/k),Autks(Vn
P,L))
ofks/k-forms of Vn
P,L. Fix such a choice of sign, and, for such a Galois representat ionρ,
let(VP,L)ρdenote the associated form of Vn
P,L. The following two results are the versions
of Theorems 9.5 and 9.6 over ﬁelds that are not necessarily se parably closed.
Theorem 9.9. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pand ﬁnite degree of imperfection r >0.
FixP,Las in Deﬁnition 7.3. Then for every semiwound weakly permawound k-group
schemeU, there is a ﬁltration 0 =U0⊂ ··· ⊂Um=Ubyk-group schemes such that, for
each1≤i≤m, thek-groupUi/Ui−1is isomorphic either to Rk1/p/k(αp), or to(VP,L)ρfor
some irreducible continuous ﬁnite-dimensional Fp-representation ρofGal(ks/k).
Theorem 9.10. Letkbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pand ﬁnite degree of imperfection r>0.
FixP,Las in Deﬁnition 7.3. Then for every wound permawound k-group scheme U, there
is a ﬁltration 1 =U0/triangleleftequal···/triangleleftequalUm=Ubyk-group schemes such that, for each 1≤i≤m,
thek-groupUi/Ui−1is isomorphic either to Rk1/p/k(αp), or to(VP,L)ρfor some irreducible
continuous ﬁnite-dimensional Fp-representation ρofGal(ks/k).
Proof of Theorems 9.9 and 9.10. The reduction of Theorem 9.6 to Theorem 9.5 also works
here to reduce Theorem 9.10 to Theorem 9.9, so we prove the lat ter. We show that, if
U/\e}atio\slash= 0, then it admits a surjection onto either Rk1/p/k(αp)or(VP,L)ρfor some irreducible
ρ, and the proof then proceeds exactly as in the proof of Theore m 9.5. IfUis not smooth,
then Proposition 9.4 furnishes a nonzero homomorphism f:U→Rk1/p/k(αp). SinceUis
weakly permawound, im(f)is quasi-weakly permawound, so fis surjective by Corollary
7.8.
Assume, on the other hand, that Uis smooth. By Theorem 9.3, there is a ﬁnite Galois
extensionK/kand a nonzero K-homomorphism φ1:UK→(VP,L)K. Letφ1,...,φ n:UK→
(VP,L)Kdenote the Gal(K/k)-conjugates of φ1, and letHi:= ker(φi). Then∩n
i=1Hi⊂UK
isGal(K/k)-invariant, hence descends uniquely to a k-subgroupH⊂U. Further,HKis
the kernel of the map φ:=/producttext
iφi:UK→/producttext
i(VP,L)K. BecauseUis weakly permawound
overk, it is so over Kby Proposition 6.7. Thus im(φ)is quasi-weakly permawound, hence
it isK-isomorphic to Vm
P,Lfor some 0<m≤nby Proposition 9.8. (We also implicitly use
Proposition 3.6 to ensure that Pis still reduced and universal over K.) Therefore, U/H
is aK/k-form of Vm
P,L, hence isomorphic to (VP,L)βfor some continuous m-dimensional
Galois representation over Fp. Choose a nonzero irreducible quotient ρofβ. Then the
composition U/H→(VP,L)β→(VP,L)ρis surjective.
10 Cohomology of unipotent groups
In this section we illustrate the utility of permawound unip otent groups by applying them
to the study of the cohomology of unipotent groups. In partic ular, we prove that for a
non-split smooth unipotent group Uover an inﬁnite ﬁeld Kﬁnitely generated over Fp,
47H1(K,U)is inﬁnite (Theorem 1.6). The idea underlying the proof is qu ite simple. We
reduce to the semiwound commutative p-torsion case, and ubiquity (Theorem 6.12) then
allows us to assume that Uis permawound. If Uadmits a surjection onto VP,LwithP
andLas in Corollary 8.6, then [NNR, Lem.2.4] reduces us to the cas eU=VP,L. This
case is then handled by using Proposition 8.5 to show that VP,Lhas nonvanishing H1over
inﬁnitely many completions of K, and the desired inﬁnitude is then easily obtained from a
version of weak approximation in this setting.
In general, rigidity (Theorem 9.6) implies that Usurjects onto VP,Lnot overK, but over
a ﬁnite separable extension E/K. The trick is to show that the extension E/K trivializes
at inﬁnitely many completions of K. That is, for inﬁnitely many completions KwofK,
the map Spec(E⊗KKw)→Spec(Kw)admits a section. It then follows that over such Kw
there is a surjection U։VP,Land one then proceeds as above.
The key ﬁrst step, therefore, is to obtain this trivializati on at inﬁnitely many places of
K. This is a geometric analogue of the fact that, for a ﬁnite ext ensionF/K of number
ﬁelds, inﬁnitely many primes of Ksplit completely in F. The proof of that fact relies upon
noting that the zeta functions of the two ﬁelds both have thei r rightmost pole at the same
point1. (What one really needs is that it is at the same x-coordinate.) We will therefore
proceed similarly to prove the desired local trivializatio n, by using properties of the zeta
functions of varieties corresponding to the function ﬁelds EandK. We begin with the
following proposition – interesting in its own right – from w hich the local trivialization
follows easily. In what follows, for a scheme W,Wcldenotes the set of closed points of W.
Proposition 10.1. Letf:X→Ybe a generically ﬁnite morphism between positive-
dimensional Fp-schemes of ﬁnite type, and let Sbe the set of closed points y∈Ysuch
thatf−1(y)→yadmits a section. Then Sis inﬁnite.
Proof. For anFq-schemeWof ﬁnite type, recall that the zeta function of Wis the mero-
morphic function of sdeﬁned by the Euler product
ζW(s) :=/productdisplay
w∈Wcl(1−|κ(w)|)−s)−1.
Ifd:= dim(W), then this product converges absolutely and uniformly on Re(s)>d+ǫfor
anyǫ>0. Furthermore, by the celebrated Weil conjectures proved by Dwork, Grothendieck,
and Deligne, it is a rational function of T:=q−s, and has a simple pole at s=dwhenW
is irreducible.
In particular, these remarks apply to XandY, which have the same dimension – d, say
– because of the generic ﬁniteness of f. We may shrink XandYand thereby assume them
to be irreducible. If the set Sreferred to in the proposition were ﬁnite, then one would
have
|κ(x)| ≥ |κ(f(x))|2
48for all but ﬁnitely many x∈Xcl. It would then follow that the Euler product expansion of
ζXwas absolutely and uniformly convergent on Re(s)>d/2+ǫ, which is impossible as ζX
has a pole at s=d.
We may now prove the desired trivialization result.
Proposition 10.2. Letf:X→Ybe a generically étale morphism between positive-
dimensional integral Fp-schemes of ﬁnite type with function ﬁelds EandK, respectively.
For a closed point y∈Y, letKydenote the fraction ﬁeld of the completion /hatwideOY,yof the local
ringOY,y. Then the set Tofy∈Yclsuch that the map Spec(E⊗KKy)→Spec(Ky)has a
section is inﬁnite.
Proof. We may shrink XandYand thereby assume that fis ﬁnite. Then let Sbe as
in Proposition 10.1. We will show that S⊂T. Fory∈S,f−1(/hatwideOY,y)is the spectrum
of a ﬁnite étale /hatwideOY,y-algebraA. Because/hatwideOY,yis complete, and therefore Henselian, Ais
a ﬁnite product of local ﬁnite étale /hatwideOY,y-algebras, and by deﬁnition of S, at least one of
these algebras has residue ﬁeld isomorphic to that of /hatwideOY,y. Because/hatwideOY,yis Henselian, it
follows that the map Spec(A)→Spec(/hatwideOY,y)admits a section, and the desired conclusion
then follows by passing to fraction ﬁelds.
Before proving the main result, we require a version of weak ap proximation.
Proposition 10.3. LetXbe a nonempty integral quasi-projective k-scheme with function
ﬁeldK. Forx∈Xcl, letKxdenote the fraction ﬁeld of the completion /hatwideOX,xof the local
ringOX,x. Then the image of the embedding K ֒→/producttext
x∈XclKxis dense, where the latter
set is given the product topology arising from the mx-adic topologies on the Kx, withmxthe
maximal ideal of OX,x.
Proof. LetS⊂Xclbe a ﬁnite subset, and for each x∈Sletαx∈Kx. We must show that
there exists β∈Kas close as we desire to each of the αxsimultaneously. Because Xis
quasi-projective, any ﬁnite subset of Xis contained in an aﬃne open, so we may assume
thatX= Spec(A)is aﬃne. Because Kis dense in each Kx, we may assume that each
αx∈K. Then multiplying through by a common denominator, we may ev en assume that
eachαx∈A, because choosing β∈Asuitably close to the αxafter clearing denominators
will yield the desired approximation by redividing by the co mmon denominator. Thus we
haveαx∈Aforx∈Sand we seek β∈Aasx-adically close as we may desire to each of the
αxsimultaneously. But each xcorresponds to a maximal ideal IxofA. In particular, the Ix
are pairwise comaximal, hence the desired conclusion follo ws from the Chinese Remainder
Theorem.
We are now prepared to prove the main result of this section.
49Theorem 10.4. (Theorem 1.6)LetKbe an inﬁnite ﬁnitely generated extension ﬁeld of
Fp, and letUbe a smooth unipotent K-group scheme that is not split. Then H1(K,U)is
inﬁnite.
Proof. Combining Lemma 9.2 and [NNR, Lem.2.4], we may assume that Uis semiwound,
commutative, and p-torsion. By ubiquity (Theorem 6.12), we reduce to the case in which
Uis permawound. Let PandLbe as in Corollary 8.6. By rigidity (Theorem 9.6), for some
ﬁnite separable extension E/K,UEadmits a surjection onto either RE1/p/E(αp)or(VP,L)E.
Because the former is not smooth, there must be a surjection on to the latter. Now write K,
respectively E, as the function ﬁelds of smooth quasi-projective Fp-schemesY, respectively
X, of ﬁnite type such that the extension E/K arises via an Fp-morphism f:X→Y.
ShrinkingY(hence also X) if necessary, we may assume that the dλifreely generate the
sheafΩ1
Y/Fp. It then follows that, for each y∈Ycl, in the notation of Proposition 8.5,
the elements λi−cigenerate the maximal ideal of the local ring at y. BecauseE/K is
separable,fis generically étale, so Proposition 10.2 ensures that, for inﬁnitely many y∈Ycl,
the map Spec(E⊗KKy)→Spec(Ky)admits a section. In particular, there is a surjective
Ky-homomorphism Uy։(VP,L)Ky, so by Proposition 8.5 and [NNR, Lem.2.4] again, we
ﬁnd that H1(Ky,U)/\e}atio\slash= 0for inﬁnitely many y∈Ycl.
BecauseUis smooth, commutative, and p-torsion, it is isomorphic to {F= 0} ⊂Gn
a
for somep-polynomial 0/\e}atio\slash=F∈k[X1,...,X n][CGP, Prop.B.1.13]. Therefore, for any ﬁeld
extensionM/K, one has a natural (once one ﬁxes an isomorphism between Uand{F= 0})
isomorphism H1(M,U)≃M/F(Mn). Letm>0be given. Choose a subset S⊂Yclof size
msuch that H1(Ky,U)/\e}atio\slash= 0for ally∈S. This means that, for each y∈S, one hasαy∈Ky
such thatαy/\e}atio\slash∈F(Kn
y). For each subset T⊂S, letαT∈/producttext
y∈SKybe the element that is
αyon theyfactors inTand0for thoseynot inT. Using Proposition 10.3, choose for each
Tan element βT∈Kthat is very close to αT. Then we claim that the βTyield distinct
elements in K/F(Kn)≃H1(K,U)for distinct T. It will then follow that H1(K,U)has size
at least2m, and since m>0was arbitrary, this will complete the proof of the theorem.
It only remains to check that the βTdo indeed yield distinct cohomology classes. Given
T/\e}atio\slash=T′, lets∈Sbe a place where they diﬀer – say, s∈T−T′. ThenβT−βT′is close to
αs∈Ks. BecauseFis a smooth morphism, it induces an open map Kn
s→Ks. It follows
that every element of Ksclose toαslies in the same nontrivial cohomology class as αs.
Therefore,βT−βT′/\e}atio\slash∈F(Kn
s), so also /\e}atio\slash∈F(Kn). It follows that βT−βT′yields a nontrivial
class inH1(K,U), as desired.
Remark 10.5.The smoothness assumption is crucial in Theorem 10.4. Indee d, the unipotent
K-groupU:= RK1/p/K(αp)satisﬁes H1(K,U) = 0 because it is deﬁned by a universal
monogeneous p-polynomial by Proposition 7.4. One can say more about the co homology of
unipotent groups beyond the smooth case, but doing so here wo uld take us too far aﬁeld,
so we postpone such a discussion for now.
5011 Unipotent quotients of commutative pseudo-reductive gr oups
In this section we apply permawound unipotent groups to give a partial answer to Totaro’s
question 1.7 about commutative pseudo-reductive groups ov er ﬁelds of degree of imperfec-
tion1. More precisely, we will use permawound groups to provide a r emarkably simple
proof of the aﬃrmative answer to Question 1.7 in the case in wh ichUisp-torsion. A
treatment of general Uis signiﬁcantly more involved, so we postpone a discussion o f this
more general case for now.
We begin by identifying the group Vof Deﬁnition 7.3 when khas degree of imperfection
1. The following result is [Oes, Ch.VI, Prop.5.3].
Proposition 11.1. Letkbe a ﬁeld of degree of imperfection 1, and letλ∈k−kp. Then
Rk1/p/k(Gm)/Gm≃VP,L, whereP:=/summationtextp−1
i=0λiXp
i∈k[X0,...,X p−1]andL:=−Xp−1.
The following theorem answers Question 1.7 in the aﬃrmative whenUisp-torsion.
Theorem 11.2. (Theorem 1.8)Letkbe a ﬁeld of degree of imperfection 1. Then every
commutative p-torsion wound unipotent k-group is the maximal unipotent quotient of a
commutative pseudo-reductive k-group.
Proof. By [Tot, Lem.9.1], we may assume that kis separably closed. Note that the con-
clusion of the theorem is preserved upon passage to subgroup s: IfU′⊂Uis an inclusion of
commutative wound unipotent k-groups, and Uis the maximal unipotent quotient of the
commutative pseudo-reductive group C, thenU′is the maximal unipotent quotient of the
smooth connected commutative k-subgroupC′:=C×UU′ofC, which is pseudo-reductive
becauseCis. Thanks to the ubiquity of permawound unipotent groups (T heorem 6.12),
therefore, in proving the theorem we may assume that Uis permawound.
We proceed by induction on dim(U), the0-dimensional case being trivial. So assume
thatU/\e}atio\slash= 0. By rigidity (Theorem 9.6), there is an exact sequence
0−→U′−→Uπ− −→U−→1
withUwound (and permawound by Proposition 5.4) and U′isomorphic to either Rk1/p/k(αp)
orV. By induction, we may assume that Uis the maximal unipotent quotient of a com-
mutative pseudo-reductive group C. IfU′≃V, thenU≃U×Vby Corollary 8.3. Since V
is the maximal unipotent quotient of the pseudo-reductive g roupRk1/p/k(Gm)(Proposition
11.1), it follows that Uis the maximal unipotent quotient of the commutative pseudo -
reductive group C:=C×Rk1/p/k(Gm).
Suppose, on the other hand, that U′≃Rk1/p/k(αp). ThenUis the maximal unipotent
quotient of the smooth connected commutative k-groupC:=C×UU(becauseCis an
extension of Uby a torus, which also explains why it is smooth and connected ), and we
claim thatCis pseudo-reductive. We have an exact sequence
0−→U′−→Cπ− −→C−→0.
51To see that Cis pseudo-reductive, suppose that W⊂Cis smooth connected unipotent.
We must show that W= 0. We haveπ(W) = 0 becauseCis pseudo-reductive, so W⊂U′.
ButU′is totally nonsmooth, so this implies that W= 0.
A Semiwound groups
The notion of woundness plays a central role in the theory of s mooth connected unipotent
groups (and therefore of more general algebraic groups) ove r imperfect ﬁelds. It is useful
to extend this notion to arbitrary unipotent groups, which w e do in this brief appendix.
Proposition A.1. LetUbe a unipotent group scheme over a ﬁeld k. The following are
equivalent:
(i) There is no k-group inclusion Ga֒→U.
(ii) There is no nonzero k-group homomorphism Ga→U.
(iii) Every k-morphism A1
k→Uis the constant map to some u∈U(k).
Proof. We ﬁrst note a trivial but useful reformulation of condition (iii) as the condition that
the onlyk-morphism A1
k→Gwith0/mapsto→1∈G(k)is the constant map to 1. Each of the
conditions for Uis equivalent to the same condition for the maximal smooth k-subgroup
scheme ofU(see [CGP, Lem.C.4.1, Rem.C.4.2]), so we are free to assume t hatUis smooth.
Further, each condition for Uis equivalent to the same condition for the identity compone nt
ofU. Thus we may further assume that Uis connected. The desired equivalence is then
[CGP, Prop.B.3.2].
Deﬁnition A.2. We say that a unipotent group scheme Uover a ﬁeld kisk-semiwound , or
just semiwound when kis clear from context, when the equivalent conditions of Pro position
A.1 hold for U.
As with woundness, semiwoundness is insensitive to separab le ﬁeld extension.
Proposition A.3. LetK/kbe a separable extension of ﬁelds, and let Ube a unipotent
k-group scheme. Then Uisk-semiwound if and only if UKisK-semiwound.
Proof. The if direction is clear. For the only if direction, we ﬁrst n ote that semiwoundness is
insensitive to replacing a group with its maximal smooth sub group. Since the formation of
the maximal smooth subgroup is insensitive to separable ﬁel d extension [CGP, Lem.C.4.1,
Rem.C.4.2], we are free to assume that Uis smooth. Since semiwoundness is insensitive to
replacing a group by its identity component, and since the fo rmation of the identity com-
ponent is insensitive to arbitrary ﬁeld extension, we may al so assume that Uis connected.
The proposition then follows from [CGP, Prop.B.3.2].
52B Breen’s spectral sequences
In this appendix, we discuss a few spectral sequences constr ucted by Breen that we utilize
in the proof of Lemma 4.5. For more details, see [Bre2, §1] and e specially [Bre1, page
1250]. Let Sbe a scheme. Associated to any commutative S-group scheme G, there is
a descending complex A(G) =A(G)•of fppf abelian sheaves concentrated in nonnegative
degrees such that each term of A(G)is a product of sheaves of the form Z[Gn](the sheaf
freely generated by Gn). Further, A(G)0=Z[G], the canonical map G→A(G)0induces
an isomorphism
G≃H0(A(G)), (B.1)
and we have
H1(A(G)) = 0 H 2(A(G)) =G/2G. (B.2)
We also have
A(G)1=Z[G2],
A(G)2=Z[G2]⊕Z[G3],
and the diﬀerential A(G)1=Z[G2]→Z[G] =A(G)0is the map induced by m−π2
1−π2
2:
G×G→G, wherem,π2
i:G×G→Gare the multiplication and projection maps,
respectively, while the diﬀerential A(G)2=Z[G2]⊕Z[G3]→Z[G2] =A(G)1is induced on
the ﬁrst component by the map Id−σ:G2→G2, whereσ:G2→G2is the switching map
(g1,g2)/mapsto→(g2,g1), and on the second component the diﬀerential is induced by th e map
(π3
1,m◦π23)+π23−(m◦π12,π3
3)−π12:G3→G2,
whereπ3
i:G3→Gis projection onto the ith factor,πij:G3→G2is projection onto the
ith andjth factors, and m:G2→Gis once again multiplication.
Breen obtains ﬁrst a spectral sequence
Fi,j
1= Extj(A(G)i,H) =⇒Exti+j(A(G),H).
We have a canonical isomorphism Extj(Z[G],·)≃Hj(G,·)of functors on fppf abelian
sheaves, since both are the derived functors of Γ(G,·), thanks to Yoneda’s Lemma. Thus,
the sequence above becomes
Fi,j
1= Hj(Xi,H) =⇒Exti+j(A(G),H), (B.3)
whereXiis some explicit disjoint union of products of copies of G, and in particular,
X0=G X 1=G2X2=G2/coproductdisplay
G3(B.4)
with the diﬀerentials F0,j
1→F1,j
1being
m∗−(π1
1)∗−(π2
2)∗, (B.5)
53and the diﬀerential F1,j
1→F2,j
1being
(1∗−σ∗)×(π3
1,m◦π23)∗+π∗
23−(m◦π12,π3
3)∗−π∗
12. (B.6)
In fact, Breen shows that we may replace the above sequence wit h another one that is
somewhat more convenient, involving “reduced” cohomology groups/tildewideHj(Xi,H)deﬁned as
follows. Let Yibe the analogue of Xifor the0group; that is, Yiis a corepresenting object for
Hom(A(0)i,·)(soYiis a disjoint union of copies of S). Then via the identity section S→G,
we obtain maps Yi→Xi, and we deﬁne /tildewideHj(Xi,H) := ker(Hj(Xi,H)→Hj(Yi,H))to be
the kernel of the induced map on cohomology. Breen proved that these reduced cohomology
groups provide a spectral sequence analogous to (B.3) and wit h the same abutment. That
is, we have a spectral sequence
Ei,j
1=/tildewideHj(Xi,H) =⇒Exti+j(A(G),H). (B.7)
The second spectral sequence constructed by Breen takes the f ollowing form:
′Ei,j
2= Exti
S(Hj(A(G)),H) =⇒Exti+j
S(A(G),H). (B.8)
