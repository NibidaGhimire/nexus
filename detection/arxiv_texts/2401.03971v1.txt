Abstract
Benzobisthiadiazoles (BBTs) are promising organic semiconductors for applications
in field effect transistors and solar cells, since they possess a strong electron-accepting
character. Thereby the electronic structure of organic/metal interfaces and within thin
films is essential for the performance of organic electronic devices. Here, we study the
structural and the electronic properties of two BBTs, with different core substitution
pattern, a phenyl (BBT-Ph) and thiophene (BBT-Th) derivative adsorbed on Au(111)
using vibrational and electronic high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy in
combination with state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations. In the mono- and
1arXiv:2401.03971v1  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  8 Jan 2024multilayer both BBTs adopt a planar adsorption geometry with the molecular back-
bone as well as the phenyl and thiophene side groups are oriented parallel to the gold
substrate. The energies of the lowest excited electronic singlet states ( S) and the first
triplet state ( T1) are determined. The optical gap ( S0→S1transition) is found to be
2.2 eV for BBT-Ph and 1.6 eV for BBT-Th. The energy of T1is identified to be 1.2 eV
in BBT-Ph and in the case of BBT-Th 0.7 eV. Thus, both the optical gap size as well
as the T1energy are drastically reduced in BBT-Th compared to BBT-Ph. Based on
our quantum chemical calculations this is attributed to the electron-rich nature of the
five-membered thiophene rings in conjunction with their preference for planar geome-
tries. Variation of the substitution pattern in BBTs opens the opportunity for tailoring
their electronic properties.
Introduction
Benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c’]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBT) containing polymers and small molecules are
promising candidates for applications in organic (opto) electronic devices such as solar cells,
light emitting diodes, or field effect transistors,1–4because they possess a strong electron-
accepting character5and inherent small optical band gaps.6–9In addition, they show auspi-
ciouschargecarriermobilities, oftenambipolar.2,10Fordeviceperformancethemolecularori-
entation at the interface to an electrode as well as within a molecular film (film morphology)
plays an essential role, since it strongly influences the electronic properties such as energy
level alignment or charge transport properties.11–24Utilizing high-resolution electron energy
loss spectroscopy (HREELS) allows for the analysis of both the adsorption and electronic
properties of molecules on (semi)metallic surfaces and within thin films.25–36HREELS has
already been successfully applied to investigate the energies of intramolecular electronic tran-
sitions (e.g. S0→S1).25–29,35,37,38Furhermore, HREELS opens up the opportunity to gain
insights into the energetic position of triplet states,37,39–42which are not accessible with (lin-
ear) optical methods. While the adsorption and electronic properties of S-heteropolycyclic
2aromatic molecules in particular thiophene derivatives on metal substrates have been stud-
ied in great detail (see e.g. Refs.43–55) due to their relevance in vacuum-processed small
molecule organic solar cells,56–60only a few examples of N-heteropolycycles are known in lit-
erature.28,29,36,38,41,42,61,62Notably, N-heteropolycyclic compounds are promising candidates
for electron transporting (n-channel) semiconductors, which are of great interest as organic
fieldeffecttransistors.63–67InthecaseofS-andN-containingheteropolycyclesonlyonestudy
is known in literature.37Therein, the structural and electronic properties of naphthothiadi-
azole derivatives adsorbed on Au(111) have been investigated with HREELS, in particular
the influence of core halogenation on the electronic structure.37Several singlet and the first
triplet transition energies have been determined. It has been found that halogenation leads
to a decrease of the optical gap size.

present study.
In the present contribution we study the adsorption and electronic properties of two
BBT derivatives, the phenyl substituted 4,8-diphenyl-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c’]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole
(BBT-Ph) and thiophene substituted 4,8-dithiophene-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c’]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole
(BBT-Th) shown in Fig. 1 on Au(111) using vibrational and electronic HREELS as well as
state-of-the-art quantum chemical methodology. In particular we focus on the influence of
core substitution (phenyl vs. thiophene) on the electronic structure. We found that both
BBT derivatives in the monolayer and thin film adopt an adsorption geometry in which the
3molecular backbone and the side groups (phenyl or thiophene) are orient themselves parallel
totheAu(111)substrate. Forbothderivativesseveralsinglettransitionsareidentifiedaswell
as the first triplet state. Going from BBT-Ph to BBT-Th results in a pronounced reduction
of the electronic transition energies.
Methods
The HREELS experiments were performed under ultra-high vacuum conditions at a sample
temperature of around 90 K. The Au(111) single crystal was prepared by standard procedure
of Ar+sputtering and annealing. The BBT compounds were synthesized according to the
procedures reported in Ref.68They were deposited from an effusion cell held at 443 K for
BBT-Ph and at 468 K for BBT-Th onto the Au(111) sample held at 300 K. The coverage was
determined by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements (see supporting
information; Figs. S1 and S2)). While in the monolayer (ML) regime i.e., the molecules
in direct contact with the metal substrate, BBT-Ph desorbs intact, the BBT-Th molecules
are decaying as can be concluded from HREELS and scanning tunneling microscopy ex-
periments (see supporting information; Figs. S3–S5), therefore the coverage determination
for BBT-Th has a larger error. However, for both BBT-Ph a defined ML coverage can be
prepared by adsorbing a multilayer followed by heating to 400 K to desorb the multilayer.
For BBT-Th direct deposition of the molecules was used. HREELS measurements were
performed with incident electron energy of 3.5 eV and 15 eV for vibrational and electronic
HREELS, respectively. For experimental details see Refs.27–29,69,70To assign the vibrational
modesofBBT-PhandBBT-Th, densityfunctionaltheory(DFT)calculationsfortheisolated
molecules were carried out using the Gaussian09 package.71Thereby the standard B3LYP
exchange-correlation (xc) functional and the 6-311G basis set were employed.
Initial input geometries were generated using the universal force field as implemented in
Avogadro72and then optimized using DFT73,74with the standard B3LYP75xc functional
4and the aug-cc-pVDZ76–78basis set employing the D4 dispersion correction.79Frequency
calculations were performed to confirm the nature of the stationary points as minima on
the potential energy surface. The conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) was
utilized to account for solvent effects of dichloromethane (DCM, ϵ= 9.08) and chloroform
(CHCl3,ϵ= 4.9).80,81Excitation energies were calculated at the optimized ground state
equilibrium geometries with the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA)82to linear-response
time-dependent DFT (TDDFT)83,84employing the BMK85xc-functional and aug-cc-pVDZ
basis set.
Results and Discussion
While the energy level alignment at metal/organic interfaces strongly depends on the elec-
troniccouplingbetweenmetalandmolecularstates, theelectronicpropertiesofthemolecules
in a film are strongly influenced by the strength of their intermolecular interactions. In ad-
dition, electronic properties are also highly affected by the molecular adsorption geometry,
both at the interface as well as within the film. Therefore we first analyzed the adsorption
properties of the BBT derivatives at the interface and within the thin films using vibrational
HREELS.

and 748 cm−1(values obtained for 1 ML BBT-Ph/Au(111)) are observed. These vibrational
modes are dipole-active, i.e., the intensity ratio between specular and off-specular scattered
electrons is high and dipole scattering is the main excitation mechanism. By comparing the
vibrational HREEL spectrum with the DFT calculation, the vibrations can be assigned to
a combined γω(C-C-C) and γω(C-H) wagging ( ω) mode in the phenyl moieties (499 cm−1)
and to γω(C-H) wagging vibrations in the phenyl side groups (690 and 748 cm−1) (for the

with a γω(C-H) wagging mode in the phenyl side groups. Contrary, the intensity of the in-
plane ν(C–H) stretching mode (3044 cm−1) shows no difference between dipole and impact
scattered electrons. Thus, this mode is non-dipole active and accordingly impact scattering
is the main excitation mechanism. Only one further in-plane vibration resulting from ν(C–
C–C) stretching vibration or δ(C–H) deformation mode are detected at 1071 cm−1, which
possesses a very low intensity. From these observations we conclude that in the monolayer
regime BBT-Ph molecules adopt a planer adsorption geometry with the molecular backbone
as well as the phenyl-rings oriented parallel to the Au(111) surface. It has be mentioned, that
in the DFT calculations (after energy relaxation and geometry optimisation) the molecule
is not arranged planar. The phenyl rings are twisted by 36.9◦with respect to the planar
molecular backbone. In comparison, in the BBT-Ph crystal structure an angle of 45.9◦has
been observed.8The planar adsorption geometry results in a change of the molecular point
group from D2toD2h, which might be reason for the discrepancies between the vibrational
transition energies attained from the DFT calculations in comparison to the experimental
7values (see Table 1). In the multilayer regime (Figure 2 b)), in addition to the very intense
dipole-active modes found in the monolayer, several very low-intensity non-dipole active
vibrations (below 510 cm−1and above 760 cm−1) are observed, which exhibit a dynamic
dipole moment parallel to the surface indicating a slight tilting (or small disorder) of the
molecular arrangement at higher coverage.

In the monolayer regime all observed vibrational losses are dipole-active, thus, as for the
BBT-Ph, the BBT-Th molecules are adsorbed flat with the molecular backbone and the
thiophene rings oriented parallel to the surface. Similar to BBT-Ph, further peaks with very
low intensity appear in the mulitlayer spectrum above 1000 cm−1(Figure 3b)). They can
be assigned to in-plane modes. The most striking difference between the ML and multilayer
data is the appearance of a very intense dipole-active peak at 137 cm−1, which is attributed
to the out-of-plane backbone twisting mode γτ(N–S–N). This can be explained by a strong
adsorbate/substrate interaction in the monolayer regime which may lead to a suppression
of this vibration. Hence, decoupling of the molecules from the metallic substrate at higher
coverages results in the observation of the vibrational mode.86However, we conclude that in
the monolayer as well as in the multilayer regime the molecules adopt a planar adsorption
9geometry (molecular backbone and the thiophene moieties) with respect to the surface plane.
Electronic properties of benzobisthiadiazoles on Au(111)
For gaining comprehensive insights into the electronic structure of the BBTs, i.e., the identi-
fication and assignment of singlet and triplet transition energies and to analyze the influence
of the different core substitution (phenyl vs. thiophene) we utilized electronic HREELS and
state-of-the-art quantum chemical methods.

coverage of 11 ML some features are more pronounced. In the ML spectrum we assign based
on our quantum chemical calculations (see below) the peak detected at 1.2 eV to the first
10triplet state ( T1) of BBT-Ph. The peak at 2.0 eV is attributed to the S0→S1transition,

at 3.4 and 4.1 eV are ascribed to molecular transitions. The former one gains intensity in
the 11 ML spectrum as well as the S0→S1transition, because in the multilayer regime the

meV from 2.0 to 2.2 eV. The plasmonic contribution (CSP) is not observed in the multilayer
data due to the surface sensitivity of HREELS, viz. only the uppermost layers are probed.
On the basis of our quantum chemical calculations (see below) we assign the peak at 3.5 eV
and 4.0 eV to the S0→S7andS0→S10transition, respectively.
Figure 5 a) summarizes the electronic transitions determined with electronic HREELS
of 11 ML BBT-Ph/Au(111). The optical gap observed in the thin film is in agreement
with the data measured with UV/vis spectroscopy in solution (see Figure 4 b)), only a
small energy-shift (50 meV) is found. This suggests a relatively weak influence of the metal
substrate (adsorbate/substrate interactions) and intermolecular forces (adsorbate/adsorbate
interactions) on the electronic states in the BBT-Ph thin film.
On the basis of our quantum chemical calculations, the peak observed at 2.2 eV can
be assigned to the S 0→S1transition with ππ∗character (see Figure 6 and Table 3).
The transition around 3.5 eV corresponds to the S 0→S7transition with nπ∗character
involvingthenitrogenlonepairsandtheBBT π-system. Theexcitationaround4.0eVcanbe
associated with the S 0→S10transition with ππ∗character involving both the backbone and
the phenyl substituent. These assignments have been made for the equilibrium geometry of
BBT with a torsion angle of 44.7◦between the phenyl rings and the BBT backbone according
to our calculations. The UV/vis absorption spectrum has been obtained in solution, while
the HREEL spectrum has been measured in a thin molecular film. To account for these
environmental effects the CPCM solvent model has been employed. Furthermore, since the

In a next step we studied the thiophene substituted BBT to elucidate the influence on
the electronic structure compared to BBT-Ph. Figure 7 shows the monolayer and multilayer
(5 ML) HREELS data. In the monolayer regime four electronic transitions are detected
located at 0.7, 1.3, 2.6, and 3.0 eV (peak maximum), which can be assigned to the first
triplet state (0.7 eV), the S0→S1transition (optical gap, 1.3 eV), the CSP (2.6 eV) and
S0→S7transition (3.0 eV) based on our calculations (see below). Compared to BBT-Ph,
an even more pronounced blue-shift of the transition energies are found when going from
the mono- to the multilayer. The optical gap size rises by 300 meV from 1.3 to 1.6 eV and
also by 300 eV for the S0→S7transition due to decoupling effects from the metal surface.

180 meV). In addition, a feature at 3.8 eV is detected, which can be assigned to S0→S9
transition according to our calculations (see below). The comparison with the UV/vis data
obtained from BBT-Th in solution shows an overall agreement. However, peak shifts around
200 meV towards lower energies are found in the thin film compared to the molecules in
solution due to adsorbate/adsorbate (lateral) interactions. These interactions are obviously
much stronger in BBT-Th in comparison to BBT-Ph, where we observed only a red-shift of
around 50 meV.
Accordingtoourcalculations, BBT-Thexhibitsaplanarequilibriumgeometryincontrast
to BBT-Ph. The peak around 1.6 eV can be assigned to the S 0→S1transition with ππ∗
character involving both the BBT backbone and the thiophene substituent (see Figure 8 and
14Table 4). The observed peaks at 3.3 eV and 3.8 eV can be assigned to the S 0→S7and
S0→S9transitions with ππ∗character, respectively, of which the former is mostly centered
at the BBT moiety while the latter involves both the backbone and substituent π-systems.
Thenπ∗transition observed in BBT-Ph is a dark S 0→S10excitation for BBT-Th (see
supporting information). This excitation is destabilized with respect to the ππ∗excitations
in BBT-Th due to the interaction between the nitrogen and sulfur lone pairs within the
molecular plane. Additionally, it becomes a dark transition due to the orthogonality of the
nitrogen norbitals and the π-system in the strictly planar geometry.

gies (TDA/BMK/aug-cc-pVDZ) are compared to experimental values obtained with UV/vis

the optical gap (S 0→S1) even by 600 meV ( S1) and the first triplet state ( T1) energy by 500
meV (see Fig. 5). Our calculated shift of the S 0→S1transition energy between BBT-Ph
and BBT-Th is 0.49 eV. According to our calculations, two factors contribute to this shift.
The first one is the different angle between the substituent (Ph or Th) and the BBT moiety.
While BBT-Ph exhibits a tilting angle of 44.7◦, BBT-Th is fully planar. The relationship
between the tilting angle and the excited state energies can be seen in Figure 9. If both
BBT-Ph and BBT-Th are in a planar geometry the difference in their S 0→S1transition
energy is reduced to only 0.25 eV.

as the S 7is plotted.
If, however, an electron-withdrawing group, for example NO2is computationally intro-
duced at the thiophene ring, the corresponding S 0→S1transition energy is increased to
1.95 eV which is very close to that of planar BBT-Ph. This demonstrates the electron-rich
nature of the five-membered thiophene ring is the second factor contributing to the red shift
of the S 0→S1transition in BBT-Th. It should further be noted that the calculated S 0→S1
transition energy of 1.93 eV for planar BBT-Ph is in good agreement with the experimental
value of 2.0 eV observed with HREELS when a single monolayer is measured, for which a
planar geometry has been determined (see above).
For the T 1state, an energy difference of 0.82 eV to the ground state for planar BBT-Ph
and one of 0.97 eV for an angle of 44.7◦has been calculated. Both of them are slightly lower
than the experimentally observed one of 1.2 eV. For BBT-Th, a computed T 1energy of 0.6
eV is obtained which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 0.7 eV.
Again introducing an NO2substituent at the thiophene increases the triplet state energy
to 0.7 eV. While still slightly lower than the T 1energy of planar BBT-Ph (0.82 eV), it again
indicates the importance of the electron-rich nature of the thiophene ring. To further in-
17vestigate the influence of the thiophene ring on the T 1energy computationally, we replaced
it by pyrrole. Its relaxed geometry is again planar according to our calculations. Further-
more, it exhibits nearly the same T 1energy of 0.6 eV as BBT-Th, indicating that the sulfur
atom is not the main reason for the low T 1energy but rather the electron-rich nature of
five-membered rings in conjunction with their preference for planar geometries.
The S 7transition energy is calculated to be 3.96 eV for BBT-Ph and 3.91 eV for BBT-
Th. Both are blue shifted compared to the experimental value of around 3.5 eV (UV/vis in
hexane). Unlike the S 0→S1transition energy, the higher lying transition is barely affected
by the tilting angle as seen in Figure 9, with the S 7transition energy decreasing only by 0.08
eV when going from 0◦to 90◦tilting angle.
Compared to the HREELS value the S 7transition energy is blue shifted by 0.2 eV in
the UV/vis experiment and 0.6 eV in the calculations. The difference in excitation energies
between BBT-Ph and BBT-Th in the HREELS experiment is not observed in either our
calculations or the UV/vis spectra. Neither of these takes the gold surface or intermolecular
effects from the multilayer into account. This indicates that the shift may originate from
either the gold surface or interactions between the molecules within the layers.
Conclusion
Two benzobisthiadiazole (BBT) derivatives, a phenyl (BBT-Ph) and a thiophene (BBT-Th)
core substituted compound adsorbed on Au(111) have been investigated using vibrational
and electronic HREELS as well as quantum chemical calculations, focussing on the influence
of core substitution pattern on the electronic structure. Both BBTs have been found to
absorb in a planar adsorption geometry on Au(111), in which the molecular backbone as well
as the Ph- or Th-substituent is oriented parallel to the Au surface in the mono- as well as
multilayer regime. We were able to assign several features observed in the electronic HREEL
spectrum to the corresponding excited electronic states based on TDDFT calculations. The
18optical gap ( S0→S1transition) is found to be 2.2 eV for BBT-Ph and 1.6 eV for BBT-
Th. Thus, the change in the substitution pattern from phenyl to thiophene has led to a
pronounced reduction of the optical gap size by 0.6 eV. In addition, the energy of the first
triplet state, which is located at 1.2 eV in BBT-Ph is also decreased by 0.5 eV in BBT-Th (T 1
= 0.7 eV). Our calculations clearly demonstrated that the reason for the reduced transition
energies in BBT-Th is the electron-rich nature of the five-membered rings in conjunction
with their preference for planar geometries. Using different substitution pattern may pave
the way for fine-tuning the electronic properties of BBTs at will.
