EZRA WAXMAN AND NADAV YESHA
Abstract. On the circle of radius Rcentred at the origin, consider a “thin”
sector about the ﬁxed line y=αxwith edges given by the lines y= (α±ǫ)x,
whereǫ=ǫR→0 asR→ ∞. We establish an asymptotic count for Sα(ǫ,R), the
number of integer lattice points lying in such a sector. Our r esults depend both
on the decay rate of ǫand on the rationality/irrationality type of α. In particular,
we demonstrate that if αis Diophantine, then Sα(ǫ,R) is asymptotic to the area
of the sector, so long as ǫRt→ ∞for some t <2.
1.Introduction
TheGauss circle problem is the problem of determining how many integer lattice
points lie inside a circle, centred at the origin, with radiu sR→ ∞. This classical
problem dates back to Gauss, who employed a simple geometric argument to show
that the number of such lattice points is equal to the area of t he circle, up to an
error term of size E(R)≤2√
2πR.In 1906, Sierpi´ nski [ 8] improved the bound on
the error term to E(R) =O(R2/3), and further incremental improvements have
been subsequently made throughout the years. The current st ate-of-the-art bound,
due to Bourgain and Watt [ 1], is that E(R) =O/parenleftbig
Rt+ε/parenrightbig
for anyε >0, where
t= 517/824≈0.6274. It is famously conjectured that E(R) =O(R1/2+ε), for any
ε >0.
A natural related problem is to determine the number of latti ce points S(R) inside
asectorSect(R) of a circle with radius R→ ∞. For sectors with ﬁxedcentral angle,
Gauss’s argument can be easily extended to show that
S(R) = Area(Sect( R))+E(R),
whereE(R) =O(R).Nowak [7] (who, more generally, considered sectors in domains
of the form {xn+yn≤Rn:x,y≥0}for anyn≥2) showed that the error term can
be improved when the slopes of the sector’s two respective ed ges are either rational
or irrational of ﬁnite type (see Deﬁnition 1.2); speciﬁcally, when both slopes are
Diophantine (i.e. of type η= 1+εfor anyε >0), we have E(R) =O(R2/3−δ) for a
certain (small) δ >0. Under a suitable assumption on the irrationality type of t he
edges’ slopes, these results were further extended by Kuba [ 4] to segments of even
more general domains. An additional closely related proble m, dating back to the

work of Hardy and Littlewood [ 2,3], concerns the number of lattice points in right-
angled triangles. An asymptotic formula for this count −which plays an important
role in the proofs of [ 4,7]−is obtained by applying Koksma’s inequality together
with standard discrepancy estimates (see, e.g. [ 5, Theorem 3.2, p. 123 and Theorem
5.1, p. 143]).
In this paper we are interested in counting the number of latt ice points, Sα(ǫ,R),
lying within a sector whose central angle shrinksasR→ ∞. More explicitly, we
consider the sector Sect α,ǫ(R) centred about a ﬁxed line y=αxwith edges given
by the lines y= (α±ǫ)x, where now ǫ=ǫR→0 asR→ ∞. Our main goal is
to establish an asymptotic formula for Sα(ǫ,R) rather than to optimize the relevant
error term. In contrast to the case of ﬁxed sectors, our resul ts depend only on the
rationality/irrationality type of α, andnoton the rationality/irrationality type of
α±ǫ, the slopes of the two edges. For this reason, the results of [ 4] and [7] are not
applicable for our problem, and our argument proceeds in qui te a diﬀerent direction.
Ifǫ→0 at a rate slower than 1 /R, then upon applying a geometric argument simi-
lartothatusedintheGausscircleproblem, weﬁndthat Sα(ǫ,R)∼Area(Sect α,ǫ(R))
(see Theorem 1.1below). To obtain an asymptotic count for more quickly shrin king
sectors, we must apply an alternative method. First, we appr oximate Sα(ǫ,R) by
∆α(ǫ,R), the number of lattice point lying within a thin triangle wh ose two long
edges lie along the lines y= (α±ǫ)x. We then ﬁx a rational number p/q∈Q
that well-approximates α, and compute ∆ α(ǫ,R) by summing the contributions from
lattice points lying on a discrete collection of lines, each of which has rational slope
p/q.
Whenα∈Qis rational, we obtain an asymptotic for Sα(ǫ,R), regardless of how
fast our sectors shrink. This is due to the fact that, in such a case, all the lattice
points in Sect α,ǫ(R) lie precisely on the line y=αx, once Sect α,ǫ(R) is suﬃciently
thin. Ifαis irrational of ﬁnite type η, we obtain an asymptotic for Sα(ǫ,R) under
the assumption that ǫdecays at a rate slower than 1 /R1+1/η(Theorem 1.3below).
Speciﬁcally, when α∈Ris Diophantine, we obtain an asymptotic for Sα(ǫ,R) under
the assumption that ǫ→0 at a rate slower than 1 /Rtfor some t <2.
The behaviour of lattice points in even faster shrinking sec tors about irrational
slopes is a more subtle question. If ǫdecays at a rate 1 /R1+1/ηor faster, the above
method fails to produce an asymptotic count for Sα(ǫ,R). However, if ǫshrinkssuf-
ﬁciently quickly, then the count once again becomes much simpler. Spe ciﬁcally, when
ǫdecays faster than 1 /R1+η, we may apply an elementary argument to prove that
for suﬃciently large R, Sectα,ǫ(R) contains no lattice points whatsoever (Proposition
1.7). A related question concerns the distribution of lattice p oints in a randomly
chosen sector of width ǫ≍1/R2. This interesting question has been addressed by
Marklof and Str¨ ombergsson [ 6], who successfully applied tools from homogeneous
dynamics to prove the existence of a (non-Poissonian) limit ing distribution for the
number of lattice points in such sectors.ON THE NUMBER OF LATTICE POINTS IN THIN SECTORS 3
1.1.Notation. Fixα∈R, and consider the interval Iǫ(α) := (α−ǫ,α+ǫ), for some
ǫ >0. Let
Sectα,ǫ(R) :={(x,y)∈R>0×R:x2+y2≤R2,y/x∈Iǫ(α)},
denote the sector of radius Rdeﬁned by an open angle of size
2θ:= tan−1(α+ǫ)−tan−1(α−ǫ)
about the angle Φ := tan−1(α). In what follows, we view ǫ=ǫRas a function of
R. Our main interest will be in thinsectors, i.e. when ǫ→0 asR→ ∞. Taylor
expanding about α, we ﬁnd that as ǫ→0, the area of Sect α,ǫ(R) is equal to
Area(Sect α,ǫ(R)) =R2

tan−1(α+ǫ)−tan−1(α−ǫ)/parenrightbig

.
Let
Sα(ǫ,R) := #{Z2∩Sectα,ǫ(R)}
= #{(m,n)∈Z>0×Z:m2+n2≤R2,|n−αm|< mǫ}
count the number of integer lattice points in Sect α,ǫ(R).
We are interested in the value of Sα(ǫ,R) in the limit as R→ ∞. For example, we
may consider the case ǫ:=R−λfor some ﬁxed λ≥0. We then classify our sectors
based on the decay rate of ǫ.
1.2.“Slowly” Shrinking Sectors. Suppose ﬁrst that ǫis either ﬁxed or decays
slower than 1 /R, in the sense that ǫR→ ∞in the limit as R→ ∞(e.g. 0≤λ <1).
Upon reﬁning the elementary geometric argument of the O(R) bound for the error
term in the Gauss circle problem, we obtain the following res ult, which yields an
asymptotic count for the number of lattice points in such slo wly shrinking sectors:
Theorem 1.1. Fixα∈R, and assume that ǫR→ ∞asR→ ∞. Then
(1.1) Sα(ǫ,R) = Area(Sect α,ǫ(R))+O(R).
1.3.“Quickly” Shrinking Sectors. In our investigation of more quickly shrinking
sectors, ourresultsdependheavilyupontherationality/i rrationality typeof α, deﬁned
as follows:
Deﬁnition 1.2. We say that an irrational α∈Ris of ﬁnite typeη, if there exists a
constant c=c(α)>0such that
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleα−p
q/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle>c
q1+η
for all integers pairs (p,q)∈Z×Z>0.
Note that for irrational α∈Rof typeηwe necessarily have η≥1 by Dirichlet’s
theorem. If α∈Ris irrational of type η= 1+εfor every ε >0, then we say that α
isDiophantine . It is well-known that almost all α∈Rare Diophantine (Khinchin’s
theorem), and every algebraic number is Diophantine (Roth’ s theorem).4 EZRA WAXMAN AND NADAV YESHA
1.3.1.Irrational Slopes. For irrational α∈R, our main result is as follows:
Theorem 1.3. Letα∈Rbe irrational of ﬁnite type η, and assume that ǫ→0, as
well as that ǫR1+1/η→ ∞asR→ ∞. Then
Sα(ǫ,R) = Area(Sect α,ǫ(R))+O/parenleftBig
ǫ1
1+ηR+R2ǫ2/parenrightBig
,
in the limit as R→ ∞.
Note that the conditions ǫ→0 andǫR1+1/η→ ∞(e.g. 0< λ <1+1/η) guarantee
the asymptotic
(1.2) Sα(ǫ,R)∼Area(Sect α,ǫ(R)).
In particular, if αis Diophantine, then ( 1.2) holds whenever ǫ→0 andǫRt→ ∞
for some t <2 (e.g. 0 < λ <2). Note that Area(Sect α,ǫ(R)) grows if and only if
ǫR2→ ∞, and thus our results in such a case are essentially optimal ( and “strictly”
so whenever α∈Ris a badly approximable irrational, i.e. irrational of type η= 1).
Note that Theorem 1.3gives a better error term than ( 1.1) whenever ǫ=o(R−1/2)
andǫR→ ∞(e.g. 1/2< λ <1). Upon comparing the error terms in Theorem 1.1
and Theorem 1.3we obtain the following corollary:
Corollary 1.4. Letα∈Rbe irrational of ﬁnite type η, and let ǫ=R−λ. Then in
the limit as R→ ∞,

In particular, when α∈Ris Diophantine, Corollary 1.4yields

1.3.2.Rational Slopes. For rational α∈Q, we obtain the following result:
Theorem 1.5. Fixα=p/q∈Q, whereq >0and(p,q) = 1. Then in the limit as
R→ ∞, we have
Sα(ǫ,R) =ǫq2R2

where{x}:=x−⌊x⌋denotes the fractional part of x.
Whenǫ=o(R−1) (e.g.λ >1), Theorem 1.5simpliﬁes to
Sα(ǫ,R) =R/radicalbig
p2+q2+O(1).ON THE NUMBER OF LATTICE POINTS IN THIN SECTORS 5
In this case, Sα(ǫ,R) is no longer asymptotic to Area(Sect α,ǫ(R)), and the only
points that contribute to Sα(ǫ,R) are those which lie precisely on the line y=αx.
Whenǫ→0 andǫR→ ∞(e.g. 0< λ <1), Theorem 1.5yields
(1.5) Sα(ǫ,R) = Area(Sect α,ǫ(R))+β/ǫ+O(ǫ2R2),
where

is a bounded function of R. In particular, as in the case of irrational slopes, if
ǫ=o(R−1/2) andǫR→ ∞(e.g. 1/2< λ <1), then ( 1.5) yields a more precise
count than ( 1.1). The following corollary summarizes the above analysis in the case
ǫ=R−λ:
Corollary 1.6. Letα=p/q∈Q, whereq >0and(p,q) = 1, and let ǫ=R−λ. Then
in the limit as R→ ∞, we have
(1.6) Sα(ǫ,R) =

Finally, we consider the case ǫ≍R−1(e.g.ǫR=c, for some c∈R>0). Then
Theorem 1.5yields
Sα(ǫ,R) =γR+O(1),
where

In particular, whenever ǫ <√

those which lie precisely on the line y=αx, and we ﬁnd that

Note, moreover, that Sα(ǫ,R) is asymptotic to Area(Sect α,ǫ(R)) if and only if γ=

1.4.“Very Quickly” Shrinking Sectors. While in the range R−1−η≪ǫ≪
R−(1+1/η)we are unableto obtain an asymptotic formula for Sα(ǫ,R), for sectors that
shrink even more quickly the situation becomes rather trivi al. Speciﬁcally, whenever
ǫ=o(R−1−η) (e.g.λ >1+η), we show that Sα(ǫ,R) = 0, for suﬃciently large R:6 EZRA WAXMAN AND NADAV YESHA
Proposition 1.7. Letα∈Rbe irrational of ﬁnite type η, and suppose that ǫ=
o(R−1−η). Then there exists R0>0such that for all R > R 0,
Sα(ǫ,R) = 0.
Inparticular, if αisaDiophantineirrational, thenforsuﬃcientlylarge R,Sα(ǫ,R) =
0 whenever ǫ=o(R−t) for some t >2 (e.g.λ >2).
1.5.Structure of Paper. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In
Section2we apply a simple geometric argument to compute Sα(ǫ,R) in the case that
ǫ→0 at a rate slower than 1 /R. In Section 3we approximate Sα(ǫ,R) by ∆ α(ǫ,R),
i.e. by the number of lattice points in a triangle whose two lo ng edges lie along
the lines y= (α±ǫ)x. In Section 4we then apply this approximation to compute
Sα(ǫ,R) whenα∈Ris irrational of ﬁnite type; and in Section 5we address the case
whenα∈Qis rational. Finally, in Section 6, we address the case in which Sect α,ǫ(R)
shrinks “very quickly”, i.e. when ǫ→0 at a rate faster than 1 /R1+η.
2.Lattice Points in Slowly Shrinking Sectors
In this section we provide a proof of Theorem 1.1, namely a count for Sα(ǫ,R)
whenǫR→ ∞asR→ ∞.
Proof of Theorem 1.1.For each z∈Z2∩Sectα,ǫ(R), let/squarezdenote a square-box of
unit area, centred at the point z. Then
Sα(ǫ,R) = Area
/uniondisplay
z∈Z2∩Sectα,ǫ(R)/squarez
,
i.e.Sα(ǫ,R) is equal to the area formed by the union of such boxes. Note, m oreover,
that ifw∈/squarezfor some z∈Z2∩Sectα,ǫ(R), then
dist(w,Sectα,ǫ(R))≤√
2/2,
i.e. the distance between wand Sect α,ǫ(R) is bounded by√
2/2. We therefore deﬁne
a wider sector, Sect+
α,ǫ(R′), with the same open angle and direction as Sect α,ǫ(R), but
extended by a distance of√
2/2 on all sides, so that
/uniondisplay
z∈Z2∩Sectα,ǫ(R)/squarez⊆Sect+
α,ǫ(R′).
To construct Sect+
α,ǫ(R′) explicitly, we expand Sect α,ǫ(R) by drawing parallel lines
distanced d=√
2/2 away from each of its two respective straight edges. Let xdenote
the distance between their point of intersection and the ori gin. Note that
x·sinθ=√

from which we obtain
x=√

We therefore set the radius of our desired sector, Sect+
α,ǫ(R′), to be equal to
R′=R+√

2·sinθ+√

upon noting that θ≍ǫ, so that θ−1=o(R). Thus

z∈Z2∩Sectα,ǫ(R)/squarez
≤Area/parenleftbig
Sect+
α,ǫ(R′)/parenrightbig
= Area(Sect α,ǫ(R))+O(R). (2.1)
To obtain a lower bound for Sα(ǫ,R), we similarly construct a sector, denoted by
Sect−
α,ǫ(R′′), with the same open angle and direction as Sect α,ǫ(R), but now shrunk
by a distance of√
2/2 on all sides, of radius
R′′=R−√

2·sinθ−√

which we note is clearly possible since θ−1=o(R). Any point w∈Sect−
α,ǫ(R′′) is
within a distance of at most√
2/2 from some lattice point z, which, by construction,
must lie in Sect α,ǫ(R). It follows that
Sect−
α,ǫ(R′′)⊆
/uniondisplay
z∈Z2∩Sectα,ǫ(R)/squarez

Using a similar analysis to that above, we ﬁnd that

and therefore
(2.2) Sα(ǫ,R)≥Area/parenleftbig

= Area(Sect α,ǫ(R))+O(R).
Combining ( 2.1) and (2.2) we conclude that
(2.3) Sα(ǫ,R) = Area(Sect α,ǫ(R))+O(R),
as desired. /square8 EZRA WAXMAN AND NADAV YESHA

In particular, if ǫ=O(R−1), then
Sα(ǫ,R) = ∆α(ǫ,R)+O(1).

n < m(α+ǫ), thenm2(1 + (α+ǫ)2)> R2, and therefore m > R//radicalbig
1+(α+ǫ)2.
Moreover, since the length of the interval ( m(α−ǫ),m(α+ǫ)) is 2mǫ≤2Rǫ, we ﬁnd
that, for any m∈N, there exist at most O(1+Rǫ) integers n∈Zsuch that
m(α−ǫ)< n < m (α+ǫ).

4.Sectors about Irrational Slopes
In this section we provide a proof of Theorem 1.3, namely a count for Sα(ǫ,R)
whenα∈Ris irrational of ﬁnite type.
Suppose α∈Ris irrational of ﬁnite type η, and let {pi/qi}i≥0denote the sequence
of the convergents to the continued fraction of α. For any p/q∈ {pi/qi}i≥0, let
δ:=α−p/q, and assume moreover that |δ|< ǫ/2. We then write
∆α(ǫ,R) ={(m,n)∈Z2:|n/m−α|< ǫ,1≤m≤R//radicalbig

4.1.Choosing an Appropriate Convergent. As above, let α∈Rbe irrational of
ﬁnite type η, and let {pi/qi}∞
i=1denote the sequence of convergents to the continued
fraction of α. Upon choosing an appropriate pair {pi/qi}, we are able to proceed with
a proof of Theorem 1.3:
Proof of Theorem 1.3.For any X:=X(R), there exists a unique isuch that qi≤
X < qi+1. There moreover exists a c=c(α)>0 such that
(4.4)c
q1+η
i</vextendsingle/vextendsingleα−pi
qi/vextendsingle/vextendsingle<1
qiqi+1.
Hence
X < qi+1<1
c·qη
i,
which further implies that
X1
η< q1
η
i+1< c−1
η·qi.
In other words, there exists a constant C >0 such that
X1
η< C·qi.
By (4.4), it thus follows that
(4.5) |δ|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingleα−pi
qi/vextendsingle/vextendsingle<1
qiqi+1<1
qiX< C·1
X1+1/η.
In order to extract an asymptotic for ∆ α(ǫ,R) from (4.3), we must choose q:=qi
such that the error term in ( 4.3) iso(ǫR2). Since q≤X, and we require that
ǫqR=o(ǫR2) (i.e. that q=o(R)), we choose X=o(R). Recall moreover that we
require|δ|< ǫ/2. By (4.5) this may be ensured by choosing X(R) such that
(4.6) C·X−(1+1/η)≤ǫ
2=⇒ǫ−1
1+1/η≪X.12 EZRA WAXMAN AND NADAV YESHA
In other words, we subject X(R) to the restrictions
(4.7) ǫ−1
1+1/η≪X=o(R).
In order to optimize our error term, we seek a choice of X(R), subject to the
restrictions in ( 4.7), which minimizes the value of
O/parenleftbiggR
q+1
ǫq2+ǫqR+1/parenrightbigg
.
Note ﬁrst that by ( 4.5) and (4.6),
1
qX≤C·1
X1+1/η≤ǫ
2=⇒1
q2X2≤ǫ2
4=⇒1
ǫq2≤ǫX2
4,
Under the assumption that X=o(R),we thus ﬁnd that
(4.8)1
ǫq2=o(ǫXR).
Similarly, since
1
qX≤ǫ
2=⇒1
q≤ǫX
2,
we ﬁnd that
(4.9)R
q=O(ǫXR).
Next, since q≤X, it follows that
(4.10) ǫqR=O(ǫXR),
and ﬁnally since q≤X=o(R), it follows that
(4.11) 1 = o/parenleftbiggR
q/parenrightbigg
=o(ǫXR).
By (4.8), (4.9), (4.10), and (4.11), it then follows that
O/parenleftbiggR
q+1
ǫq2+ǫqR+1/parenrightbigg
=O(ǫXR).
We thus choose the minimal possible value for X, namely X≍ǫ−1
1+1/η, which is o(R)
by the assumption that ǫR1+1/η→ ∞. By (4.3) and (4.7), we conclude that
(4.12) ∆ α(ǫ,R) =ǫR2
1+α2+O/parenleftBig

1+ηR/parenrightBig
.
Theorem 1.3now follows directly from ( 4.12) and Lemma 3.1.

In this section we provide a proof of Theorem 1.5, namely a count for Sα(ǫ,R)

Letd=nq−mp, and note that
|d|< mqǫ⇒ |d| ≤ǫq2R/radicalbig

as well as that
|d|< mqǫ⇔|d|
qǫ< m.
Partitioning with respect to d, we then write

where ¯pdenotes the inverse of pmoduloq. In particular, if ǫq2R//radicalbig

the only contribution to ∆ α(ǫ,R) comes from the term d= 0, i.e. points ( m,n)∈Z2
lying precisely on the line y=αx. Upon recalling that

6.Very Quickly Shrinking Sectors
Finally, in this section we provide a proof of Proposition 1.7, namely that when
α∈Ris irrational of ﬁnite type ηandǫ=o(R−1−η), we ﬁnd that Sα(ǫ,R) = 0 for
suﬃciently large R:
Proof of Proposition 1.7.Sinceαisof ﬁnitetype η, thereexists aconstant c=c(α)>
0 such that for all ( p,q)∈Z×Z>0,
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleα−p

TakeR0suﬃciently large such that for any R > R 0we have
ǫ <c
R1+η.
Then for any R > R 0, and any ( p,q)∈Z×Z>0with 0< q≤R, we ﬁnd that/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleα−p
q/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle>c
q1+η≥c
R1+η> ǫ.
It follows that for all R > R 0we have Sα(ǫ,R) = 0, as desired. /square
