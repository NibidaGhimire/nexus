ABSTRACT
The interaction of rareÔ¨Åed gases with functionalized surfaces is of great importance in technical
applications such as gas separation membranes and catalysis. To investigate the inÔ¨Çuence of function-
alization and rarefaction on gas Ô¨Çow rate in a deÔ¨Åned geometry, pressure-driven gas Ô¨Çow experiments
with helium and carbon dioxide through plain and alkyl-functionalized microchannels are performed.
The experiments cover Knudsen numbers from 0.01 to 200 and therefore the slip Ô¨Çow regime up
to free molecular Ô¨Çow. To minimize the experimental uncertainty which is prevalent in micro Ô¨Çow
experiments, a methodology is developed to make optimal use of the measurement data. The results
are compared to an analytical model predicting rareÔ¨Åed gas Ô¨Çow in straight channels and to numerical
simulations of the S-model and BGK equations. The experimental data shows no signiÔ¨Åcant differ-
ence between plain and functionalized channels. This stands in contrast to previous measurements in
smaller geometries and demonstrates that the surface-to-volume ratio seems to be too small for the
functionalization to have an inÔ¨Çuence and highlights the importance of geometric scale for surface
effects. These results also shed light on the molecular reÔ¨Çection characteristics described by the
TMAC.
1 Introduction
When the mean free path of gas molecules approaches the smallest size of the surrounding geometry, i.e. pore or
channel diameter, the gas is considered to be in a rareÔ¨Åed state. This state is of relevance for many scientiÔ¨Åc and
technical applications, for example gas separation membranes [ 1], catalysis [ 2], vacuum [ 3] and space technologies [ 4].
Gas behaves differently in a rareÔ¨Åed state and cannot be described by the continuum approach, therefore more general
kinetic methods need to be used [ 5]. In addition, under rareÔ¨Åed conditions the interaction between gas molecules
and surface is enhanced which can strongly inÔ¨Çuences the gas Ô¨Çow. This effect is utilized to increase selectivity in
membrane applications. A surface can be functionalized by attaching molecules with speciÔ¨Åc functional groups onto
the surface which selectively interact with the gas molecules.
However, previous experimental studies have shown that applying such surface functionalization signiÔ¨Åcantly reduces
the gas Ô¨Çow [ 6,7,8]. It was shown that length and density of the functional molecules are the determining factorsarXiv:2301.12575v1  [physics.flu-dyn]  29 Jan 2023RareÔ¨Åed gas Ô¨Çow in functionalized microchannels A P REPRINT

which impact the Ô¨Çow reduction [ 9,10]. The chemical composition of the functional group itself does not inÔ¨Çuence the
gas Ô¨Çow.
To investigate this behavior in a larger and, compared to porous media, well-deÔ¨Åned geometry, pressure-driven gas
Ô¨Çow experiments in straight rectangular microchannels are performed. Hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HDTMS), a silane
molecule with a C 16chain as functional group, is deposited onto the channel surfaces by chemical vapor deposition and
its inÔ¨Çuence on the gas Ô¨Çow is investigated.
The experimental results are analyzed for differences in mass Ô¨Çow rate between plain and functionalized channels
and the data is compared to numerical solutions of the linearized S-model kinetic equation [ 11], the linearized
Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) kinetic equation [12], and to an analytical model proposed in [13].
2 Methods
The mass Ô¨Çow measurements are performed with the microchannels described below in a bench-scale setup at the
IUSTI laboratory in Marseille, France and in the TRANSFLOW facility at the KIT laboratory in Karlsruhe, Germany.
The microchannels are prepared at CVT and MARUM in Bremen, Germany.
2.1 Microchannel characteristics
2.1.1 Geometry and socket
The microchannels are manufactured by wet etching on silicon wafers, with the channels aligned parallel to the wafer
surface. The etching depth corresponds to the channel height and the width is Ô¨Åxed by the masking of the wafer. After
anodic bonding with borosilicate glass to close the channels, the length is set by cutting the wafer at speciÔ¨Åc points.
Before the bonding process, the width and height of the channels are measured via vertical scanning interferometry
(VSI). VSI is an optical, non-destructive method (e.g., [ 14,15]) that uses white light in the present application. The
vertical resolution of the instrument is typically about 1 nanometer, the lateral resolution varies depending on the (mirau)
objectives used. The length of the channels is measured using a caliper gauge. Two different channel geometries are
used. For the mass Ô¨Çow measurements at the IUSTI laboratory, a stack of 100 parallel channels is manufactured, of
which 99 channels are closed by using epoxy glue ( UHU Plus Endfest ) to perform single-channel measurements. For
the KIT laboratory, 20 channels in parallel are used for increasing the mass Ô¨Çow to meet the facility‚Äôs requirements.
The geometries of the channels are given in Table 1.
For integrating the microchannels into the measurement setups, they are glued with the same epoxy into a socket with
KF (ISO quick release) Ô¨Çanges on each side for the experiments at the IUSTI, see Fig. 1a, and into a CF (ConFlat,
cooper-sealed) Ô¨Çange for the experiments at the KIT, see Fig. 1b.
2.1.2 Functionalization
The functionalization of the microchannels is performed by an in-house apparatus for chemical vapor deposition, see
Fig. 2a. Only the small channels used at the IUSTI are functionalized, because in those the largest inÔ¨Çuence is expected.
The channel socket attaches to the apparatus by KF Ô¨Çanges. The system is evacuated and Ô¨Çushed with nitrogen. After
that, HDTMS is injected into the three-neck round-bottom Ô¨Çask with nitrogen excess pressure. While heating the Ô¨Çask
in an oil bath to 150C, the Ô¨Çask is being evacuated until the goal temperature is reached and condensate on the Ô¨Çask is
visible. Then, vacuum is only pulled from the other side of the channel, creating a pressure difference along the channel
and forcing the silane through it. This process runs for 62 hours. The system is then Ô¨Çooded with air, and the channels
are extracted.
To evaluate the result of functionalization, the contact angle of water and air inside the channel is measured, with and
without functionalization, see Fig. 2b. For this, the microchannels are observed with an incident light microscope while
water is inserted into the channel using a pipette. The results (16 1.3¬∞for plain, 36.32.2¬∞for functionalized) show

a clear difference and therefore a successful functionalization. The analysis for the contact angle is performed by using
ImageJ [16] with the contact angle plugin.
2.2 Mass Ô¨Çow rate measurement facilities
In both facilities, the constant volume method is used. This means that pressure changes in the upstream (and optionally
downstream) reservoir are constantly measured, while the mass Ô¨Çow rate is deduced from the slope of the pressure
evolution over time. The setups are schematically depicted in Fig. 3.
In TRANSFLOW experimental facility, see Fig. 4a, the mass Ô¨Çow is measured by the constant volume method
using only the upstream volume. The volume of the upstream reservoir including adapter Ô¨Çange is V1= 0.606

0.012m3. Both reservoirs consist of 316LN stainless steel. All connected Ô¨Çanges are high vacuum CF Ô¨Çanges with
copper sealing or Swagelok ¬Æconnections. In the downstream reservoir, two turbomolecular pumps MAG W 2800 by
Oerlikon-Leybold are attached via a V AT UHV gate valve. The volume of the downstream reservoir is V2= 1.2m3and
is assumed quite large compared to the volume of the corresponding test channel. The whole facility can be heated with
6 heating circuits on the upstream, 7 on the downstream reservoir and one on the test channel. The temperatures can be
adjusted within 1 degree.

Figure 4: (a): Experimental facility TRANSFLOW. (b): Experimental facility at the IUSTI laboratory.
To measure the pressure in both reservoirs, capacitance diaphragm gauges (CDG) by MKS, type Baratron ¬Æ690 HA,
and one hot cathode gauge by Granville-Philips, type Stable Ion ¬Æ, are installed on respectively. The CDGs provide a
maximum measurement range of 133 300 Pa ,1333 Pa and133:3 Pa at the dosing dome or 13:33 Pa at the pumping
dome, respectively. Further details about the TRANSFLOW facility can be found in [17].
For the facility at the IUSTI laboratory, the constant volume method based on pressure measurements in both upstream
and downstream volumes is used to determine the mass Ô¨Çow rate through a microchannel Ô¨Åxed between two volumes,
see Fig. 4b. A detailed description of the setup is given in [ 18]. The facility was slightly modiÔ¨Åed to work with the
channel socket described in Section 2.1. To minimize the experimental time needed for a data point, the constant
volumes 1 and 2, see Fig. 3, are reduced and they consist merely of the piping. Those volumes are measured by pressure
equilibration using a known third volume. The values of V1=17.60.4 cm3andV2=17.20.6 cm3are obtained for
the upstream and downstream volumes, respectively.
During each experimental run the temperature is measured by K type thermocouples in combination with four-wire
Pt100 for cold junction compensation. The temperature is stable within 3.1 K during an experimental run with a
maximum length of around 17 hours and corresponds to room temperature.
With this setup it is possible to measure pressures in the range of 10 to 100 000 Pa with the Capacitance Diaphragm
Gauge (CDG). These sensors have an uncertainty of 0,2 %. Two gases were used, helium and carbon dioxide, provided
4RareÔ¨Åed gas Ô¨Çow in functionalized microchannels A P REPRINT
by Air Liquide (France) with a purity of 99.999 %. The available pressure range corresponds to a Knudsen number
range of 0.03 to 10 for helium and of 0.01 to 3 for carbon dioxide.
2.3 Method for optimized mass Ô¨Çow rate measurement
2.3.1 General mass Ô¨Çow rate calculation
When the pressure in the volumes is changing due to the mass Ô¨Çow through the channel and it does so slowly in relation
to the time needed to reach a local equilibrium, we can assume that the system is in a quasi-stationary state. Therefore,
under the quasi-stationary state assumption, we can consider the change in the system as a succession of local equilibria.
For a single gas and constant volume of a tank Vithe change in mass of a gas inside is given by

Over an inÔ¨Ånitesimal time interval, we can calculate the mass Ô¨Çow rate as

RT=Mdpi

RT2=MdT

The temperature in the tank is kept stable and nearly constant in time. Therefore, the change of temperature in time
compared to the change in pressure in time is very small, so we can consider the mass Ô¨Çow rate due to change of
temperature in time negligible

or equivalently, the relative change of pressure is much greater than the relative change in temperature

Then, the mass Ô¨Çow rate, _m, is simply
_mi(t) =dmi
dt=Vi
RT=Mdpi

If both valves A and B (see Fig. 3) are closed, which is the case for the IUSTI facility but not for TRANSFLOW, the
mass conservation between volume 1 and 2 results in
_m1(t) = _m2(t) (6)
using the convention of a negative mass Ô¨Çow for a reduction of mass inside a volume.
To calculate the mass Ô¨Çow rate the pressure variation in a tank over the time is measured. At the IUSTI laboratory, the
pressure in both upstream and downstream volumes changes: the higher upstream pressure decreases over time while
lower downstream pressure increases, until an equilibrium pressure, peq, is reached in both tanks. At the KIT laboratory,
the downstream volume is continuously evacuated, therefore only the upstream pressure change is used for mass Ô¨Çow
rate calculation.
These pressure variations in time can be Ô¨Åtted using either a linear function or more generally using an exponential
function. To be able to cover a larger experimental range where the mass Ô¨Çow might not be constant, an exponential
function is chosen here, as proposed in [19], [20]:

to get the mass Ô¨Çow rate at the beginning of the experiment. The Knudsen number associated to this mass Ô¨Çow is
calculated using p
m= 0:5 (p

2).
The measured mass Ô¨Çow rate is corrected with a previously measured leakage or outgassing mass Ô¨Çow rate by addition
or subtraction when the leakage or outgassing is signiÔ¨Åcant. The leakage mass Ô¨Çow rate is determined by setting the
pressure equal in both volumes and by monitoring the pressure rise over time. The magnitude of the inÔ¨Çuence of the
leakage correction varies strongly and is quantiÔ¨Åed in Appendix A.
Because the mass Ô¨Çow is calculated using the pressure drop in the volumes, the experiments need to run for a certain
time to have a signiÔ¨Åcant change in pressure compared to the sensor noise. However, too long measurement times
introduce external inÔ¨Çuences like temperature Ô¨Çuctuation which can impact the temperature constancy assumption,
required for implementing described mass Ô¨Çow rate extraction model, see Section 2.3. Too short measurements in turn
can lead to a high uncertainty due to the small amount of data available for a Ô¨Åt.
To Ô¨Ånd the ideal amount of data, the measurement uncertainty is minimized. The measurement uncertainty consists of
two parts: one part describing the reliability of the chosen amount of measurement data using data fragments , and the
other part describing the physical uncertainties of pressure sensors, temperature Ô¨Çuctuations and channel and facility
geometries.
2.3.2 Variability of data fragments
Thevariability of data fragments methodology differs for the IUSTI and the TRANSFLOW facilities.
In case of the IUSTI facility, an important criterion for a successful run is the match of inlet and outlet mass Ô¨Çows,
Eq. (6), which are independently calculated using the respective pressure drops. This criterion is not fulÔ¨Ålled if the
signal-to-noise ratio is too low, because that will introduce randomness to the mass Ô¨Çows and they likely will differ.
Also, temperature Ô¨Çuctuations would create a mismatch because a temperature rise decreases the calculated mass Ô¨Çow
rate in volume 1 and increases the calculated mass Ô¨Çow rate in volume 2.
Accordingly, the issues above can be addressed by looking at the difference of the mass Ô¨Çow rates calculated in volumes
1 and 2. To evaluate the correct experimental time, a single long experimental run is used. Only parts of this run are
analyzed to simulate different lengths of experimental runs. These parts are taken at different positions and are of
different length, resulting in time windows as depicted in Fig. 5. This results in a two-dimensional array of Ô¨Åctive
experiments, each having their analyzed mass Ô¨Çow rates and their difference between volume 1 and volume 2. An
example of a two-dimensional array, visualizing the relative difference between volume 1 and volume 2 mass Ô¨Çow rates,
is shown in Fig. 6a.

evaluations. Some samples at the top are empty because no Ô¨Åt for that data was found. (a)The full array without any
threshold. (b)A threshold of 8 %; only very few fragments fulÔ¨Åll this threshold. No sufÔ¨Åciently large area can be found.
(c)A threshold of 10 %. More fragments fulÔ¨Åll this threshold, but not enough to Ô¨Ånd a sufÔ¨Åciently large area. (d)A
threshold of 10.7 % results in a structure where a sufÔ¨Åciently large area can be found (marked with a circle). Therefore,
the corresponding relative uncertainty of mass Ô¨Çow rate due to the data fragment method is 5.35 %.
For the runs with small width, very low deviations are right next to very high deviations. This is the result of a low
signal-to-noise ratio of little data. Simply choosing the data fragment having the smallest deviation would therefore be
a matter of chance and not a reliable choice.
To tackle this problem, a second criterion is imposed: not only does a single fragment need to have a low difference
between inlet and outlet, but an area of fragments should stay below a certain deviation. This is done by applying a
threshold to the array of mass Ô¨Çow differences and searching for an area large enough to host a circle with a radius of
20 % of the width of the time window at the circle‚Äôs center. This corresponds to a possible shift of the window start by
20 % of the window width and a scaling of the window width by 20 % while staying within the threshold. To avoid
noise problems, a minimum of 3 time windows should be covered by the radius. To include as much data as possible
for the Ô¨Åt, longer runs are prioritized if ambiguity arises.
The threshold is increased until an area fulÔ¨Ålling the 20 % criterion is found. That process is depicted in Fig. 6b to 6d.
The Knudsen number and the dimensionless mass Ô¨Çow rate, deÔ¨Åned by Eq. (11), are taken from the run in the center of
the circle.
In case of TRANSFLOW, there is no difference between mass Ô¨Çow rates of volumes 1 and 2 because only volume 1
is considered, so the methodology is slightly different. Each entry of the array is investigated one by one. For each
7RareÔ¨Åed gas Ô¨Çow in functionalized microchannels A P REPRINT
entry, the difference to all other fragments is calculated. This results in an array of mass Ô¨Çow differences - not between
volumes 1 and 2, but between the current and all other data fragments. To this difference a threshold is applied like
above and a check for an area fulÔ¨Ålling the 20 % criterion is performed. If no area is found, the next entry of the array is
investigated by re-calculating the difference to all other fragments, applying the threshold and checking for an area. If
after cycling through all entries no area is found, the threshold is increased and all entries are investigated one by one
again until an area is found.
This threshold is then used for an uncertainty which is deÔ¨Åned via the population standard deviation [ 21, p. 111] as half
of the relative difference between inlet and outlet mass Ô¨Çow rates or half of the relative difference between the current
window and all other windows within the found area.
Generally, the method using two volumes should be preferred because the successful comparison of two separate mass
Ô¨Çow balances is a strong indicator of correct measurements. Using only one volume leaves more room for systematic
errors because inÔ¨Çuences like leakage or adsorption and desorption effects are not directly detectable.
2.3.3 Monte Carlo simulations
To quantify the inÔ¨Çuence of the pressure sensor uncertainties on the calculated pressure drop, a Monte Carlo simulation
is performed. The sensor uncertainty is assumed to follow a normal distribution. For each sample, the error is
calculated using the measured data and the sensor uncertainty, which is a constant factor for the IUSTI facility and a
pressure-dependent factor according to calibration certiÔ¨Åcates for the TRANSFLOW facility.
This error is added to the measured data and a Ô¨Åt is performed. The pressure drop is calculated using this Ô¨Åt. This
process is repeated with many samples until a convergence of the mean of the pressure drops resulting from the samples
is reached. The standard deviation of the pressure drop between the samples is the uncertainty of the pressure drop due
to the pressure sensor uncertainty.
2.3.4 Error propagation
The inÔ¨Çuence of the uncertainties of pressure drop (calculated with the Monte Carlo method), temperature (calculated
using the standard deviation of temperature during an experimental run), facility volumes (see Section 2.2) and channel
geometry (calculated using the VSI data, see Section 2.1.1) on the dimensional and dimensionless mass Ô¨Çow rates is
determined using standard error propagation of independent variables. This is implemented using the Python package
uncertainties [22].
2.3.5 Minimization of uncertainties
The total uncertainty is the sum of the uncertainty coming from the data fragment analysis, see Section 2.3.2, and
the uncertainty calculated by error propagation, see Section 2.3.4. To minimize the total uncertainty, the best data
fragment needs to be determined. This is done by sampling many thresholds for the array of mass Ô¨Çow differences and
performing the complete calculation of the total uncertainty for each threshold. Thresholds with no valid 20 % area
are discarded. The threshold with the lowest total uncertainty is chosen, and the data fragment associated with this
threshold is determined as the optimal data fragment. If this total uncertainty is still larger than 20 %, that experimental
run is discarded. This is by no means a polishing of data, but rather as a tool to identify experimental runs which have
issues at the execution level, like excessive adsorption and desorption effects or leakage.
2.4 Analytical and numerical solutions
For comparison with the experimental data, an analytical model and numerical simulations are used. The analytical
model, which was proposed in [ 13], provides a mass Ô¨Çow rate expression and consists of a superposition of slip as
well as diffusive Ô¨Çow. The latter is a combination of Fickian self-diffusion and free molecular Ô¨Çow. The mean free
path, which is part of both the slip Ô¨Çow end the diffusive Ô¨Çow, is adjusted to take into account the channel geometry for
high Knudsen numbers. For the molecular diameters of the gases, also inÔ¨Çuencing the mean free path, the transition
molecular diameters as presented in [13] are chosen. The model is used without further modiÔ¨Åcation for this work.
The relaxation type models of the Boltzmann equation collisional term, like BKG and S-model, are largely used for
simulation of the gas Ô¨Çows through channels of different cross-sectional shapes [ 23]. In this work, the linearized
versions of both model kinetic equations, BGK and S-model, are solved numerically. This approach allows to simulate
the gas Ô¨Çow through channels with a small ratio between the characteristic dimension of the cross-section and the
channel length, h=L1(which is the case for the channels used in these experiments) and any pressure ratio between
the tanks, see more details in [ 12,11]. However, both models require additional information about the gas-surface
interaction in terms of the accommodation coefÔ¨Åcient [ 23] which is set to 1 for this work. Furthermore, the fact that
8RareÔ¨Åed gas Ô¨Çow in functionalized microchannels A P REPRINT
a polyatomic gas is treated as a monoatomic in the numerical simulations is fully justiÔ¨Åed from the fact that in an
isothermal pressure driven Ô¨Çow, the internal degrees of freedom do not inÔ¨Çuence the Ô¨Çow rate through a duct [24].
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Measured mass Ô¨Çow rate
The measured data is shown in a form of dimensionless mass Ô¨Çow rate, G, to exclude inÔ¨Çuence of geometric scale, gas
species and temperature. This is done by dividing the measured mass Ô¨Çow rate, _m, by a mass Ô¨Çow rate often called
Knudsen diffusion, [25] resulting in a non-dimensional mass Ô¨Çow rate of

where(T)is the temperature-dependent dynamic viscosity interpolated from data available in [ 26] andpm=
0:5(p1+p2)is the mean pressure between the inlet and outlet tanks, p1andp2, respectively.
The results of the experiments for both the plain and the HDTMS-functionalized channels with helium and carbon
dioxide are shown in Fig. 7a together with the analytical curve. The so-called Knudsen minimum [ 27] at around Kn=1
is well visible. The dimensionless mass Ô¨Çow rate converges to a constant value for large Knudsen numbers as expected
[28]. One experiment, although fulÔ¨Ålling the criterion of an uncertainty of <20 %, is considered an outlier and is
therefore plotted in grey color and excluded from the Plots 7b-7d and further discussion.
It is clear from Fig. 7a that HDTMS has no signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence on the gas Ô¨Çow. This Ô¨Ånding is different to previous
measurements carried out in much smaller geometries [ 10]. The absence of an impact of the functionalized surface
may be explained by the fact that the inÔ¨Çuence of gas-surface interaction on the mass Ô¨Çow rate depends not only on the
rarefaction level but also on the channel surface to volume ratio. This ratio for the channels used in experiments at
the IUSTI laboratory is much smaller (0.4 m 1) than that of the previous experiments reported in [ 10] (300 m 1,
with a pore diameter of 20 nm). Therefore, the highest surface to volume ratio for the channels used in the experiments
presented here is likely still too small to have any inÔ¨Çuence on the mass Ô¨Çow rate.
When comparing the experiments with the analytical model previously developed [ 13] (Fig. 7b) as well as with
simulation data based on the linearized S-model kinetic equation from [ 11] (Fig. 7c) and that based on the linearized
BGK kinetic equation (Fig. 7d), all three results look very similar with little deviation between the analytical model and
numerical solutions of both kinetic equations. All neighboring measurement points have overlapping measurement
uncertainties, indicating an overall consistent result. All three models mostly lie within experimental error with deviation
being smaller than 20 % except for a single value.
To quantify the difference in mass Ô¨Çow rate between plain and functionalized channels, a t-test using unequal variances
[29] is performed. The populations are the deviations between experiment and analytical model for plain and function-
alized channels, respectively. The null hypothesis is that the populations have the same means. The samples include all
gases and channels. The test results in a p-value of 0.303, showing that there is no signiÔ¨Åcant difference in mass Ô¨Çow
rate between plain and functionalized channels.
3.2 Numerical modeling using the linearized BGK-model equation
The numerical solution of the BGK kinetic equation [ 12] has been obtained for the rectangular channel with high-to-
width aspect ratio equal to 0.0328, which correspond to the dimension of channels used in KIT experiments.

By comparing the corresponding numerical and experimental results, see Fig. 7d, it can be observed that for
monoatomic helium and for the case of the plain as well as the functionalized surface, a good agreement in the
range of 0.03Kn110 is obtained, in which the relative error ranges between 1 and 14 %. The magnitude of relative
errors is evenly distributed across the Knudsen range. Moreover, from the current experimental data, no signiÔ¨Åcant
inÔ¨Çuence of the surface treatment is observed.
For the case of the polyatomic gas CO 2, it is observed that a good agreement in the range of 0.01 Kn<1 is achieved,
with the relative error ranging between 2 and 25 %, which is signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than that for monoatomic helium. Large
discrepancies are obtained in the case of Kn 1 and for Kn <0.1, which are mainly attributed to the high uncertainty of
the experimental results. As in the case of helium, no signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence of the surface treatment is observed.
3.3 Numerical modeling using S-model equation
The authors of [ 11] have performed numerical simulations of Ô¨Çow through channels of rectangular cross-sections with
different aspect ratios using the linearized S-model kinetic equation. The channel cross-section aspect ratio used in
experiments made at the IUSTI is equal to 0.0359. This value is very close to the aspect ratio 0.0367 for which the
simulations have already been done by the authors of [ 11]. Therefore, the data for dimensionless mass Ô¨Çow rate from
Table 1 of Ref. [ 11] have been plotted in Figure 7(c) and very good agreement was obtained even for the polyatomic
gas. A TMAC of 1 seems to describe the experimental data well for both the plain and the functionalized surfaces.

3.4 Analytical model
The analytical model developed previously by some of the authors [ 13] is used to calculate the mass Ô¨Çow rate under
experimental conditions and is fully predictive. This means that the model is applied as described in [ 13] without any
modiÔ¨Åcation or adaption to the experimental data acquired in this work.
The model is based on extensions of existing expressions for the mass Ô¨Çow rate through channels of various cross-
sections. Diffuse reÔ¨Çection is assumed when using the free molecular expression of the mass Ô¨Çow rate. This means that
the tangential momentum accommodation coefÔ¨Åcient TMAC, describing the ratio of diffuse to specular reÔ¨Çection, is
equal to 1 for the free molecular regime. The TMAC is assumed to be equal to 0.9 when the slip Ô¨Çow expression is
implemented. The authors of [ 13] Ô¨Åtted the model on available experimental data from literature using the molecular
diameter as the only free parameter and obtained a so-called transition molecular diameter. The model was applied
to the present data set implementing the previously calculated transition molecular diameters for helium and carbon
dioxide, and very good agreement was found (Fig. 7b) between measured and calculated values of the mass Ô¨Çow rate.
While the model uses a TMAC of 0.9 for the slip Ô¨Çow in rectangular channels, in [ 13] it is stated that the actual
TMAC should be 1 for all Knudsen numbers and the TMAC of 0.9 is attributed to a supposedly Ô¨Çawed slip expression
for rectangular channels. The slip expression is derived from the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations using the
Maxwell slip boundary condition and, for rectangular geometries, involves terms with convergent inÔ¨Ånite series, while
the expression for circular geometries is much simpler. There seems to be a complicating inÔ¨Çuence of the more
complex rectangular geometry. A strong evidence that this is indeed the case is that if the TMAC was originally 0.9
for plain channels, it should become 1 when HDTMS is applied to the channel surfaces. HDTMS would sterically
prevent any specular reÔ¨Çection, for which an even surface is needed [ 30]. Because the mass Ô¨Çow does not change
with functionalization, however, this means that the TMAC is 1 even for the plain channels. Both the calculations of
the linearized S-model and BGK equations use a TMAC of 1, further strengthening this claim because of the good
agreement with the experimental data.
4 Conclusions
The method developed to make optimal use of the inherently noisy mass Ô¨Çow rate data is suitable to yield results
with reasonable uncertainties. While previous experiments in mesoporous structures show a clear inÔ¨Çuence of surface
functionalization, the current experiments use much larger geometries. Here, the surface functionalization does not
impact the mass Ô¨Çow rate through the channels considerably even though these experiments cover Knudsen numbers
comparable to the experiments in mesoporous structures. This indicates that the Knudsen number is not the only
parameter to consider but that there is a strong scaling dependence. The surface-to-volume ratio of the current channels
is too small for the surface functionalization to signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuence the mass Ô¨Çow rate.
The measured mass Ô¨Çow rate is compared to numerical solutions of the linearized BGK and S-model kinetic equations
and with an analytical model showing good agreement in all cases. The fully diffusive gas-surface interaction seems
to describe both types of channel surfaces well. The valid speciÔ¨Åcation of TMAC = 0.9 for the slip expression of the
analytical model indicates a potential for improvement in slip Ô¨Çow modeling of rectangular channels.
