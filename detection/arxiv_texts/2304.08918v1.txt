Abstract. On an associative algebra, we introduce the concept of symme tric
(σ,τ)-derivations together with a regularity condition and pro ve that strongly reg-
ularsymmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations are inner. Symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations are( σ,τ)-
derivations that are simultaneously ( σ,τ)-derivations as well as ( τ,σ)-derivations,
generalizing a property of commutative algebras. Motivate d by this notion, we
explore the geometry of symmetric ( σ,τ)-algebras and prove that there exist a
unique strongly regular symmetric ( σ,τ)-connection. Furthermore, we introduce
(σ,τ)-Hochschild cohomology and show that, in ﬁrst degree, it de scribes the outer
(σ,τ)-derivations on an associative algebra. Along the way, exa mples are provided
to illustrate the novel concepts.
1.Introduction
In a derivation-based approach to noncommutative geometry, de rivations play a signif-
icant role, especially in describing connections, curvature, and the torsion of a connec-
tion. Let Abe a unital associative algebra over C. For a derivation X, i.e aC-linear
mapX:A → A satisfying Leibniz rule X(fg) =fX(g) +X(f)g, a connection
∇X:M→M,on a left A-module M,satisﬁes Leibniz rule
∇X(fm) =f∇X(m)+X(f)m
(see e.g [DV88], [DVM96]. On the other hand, there are certain twiste d derivations,
called (σ,τ)-derivations which are usually not considered in the derivation-bas ed ap-
proach but do play an important role in certain deformations of Lie alg ebras as well
as in quantum groups. For example, in [HLS06] and [LS07], a q-deformed Witt alge-
bra was realized through the use of ( σ,τ)-derivations and a family of q-deformed Lie
algebra of sl2(F) was constructed using σ-derivations respectively.
A (σ,τ)-derivation is a C-linear map X:A → Asatisfying a twisted Leibniz rule
X(fg) =σ(f)X(g)+X(f)τ(g),
for algebra endomorphisms σ,τ:A → A. In [AI22], a framework for noncommutative
Riemmanian geometry is considered by constructing connections, c urvature, and tor-
sion over certain modules based on ( σ,τ)-derivations. In this framework, given a left
A-module M, a (σ,τ)-connection ∇X:M→M,satisﬁes a twisted Leibniz rule
∇X(fm) =σ(f)∇X(m)+X(f)ˆτ(m) (1.1)
for a (σ,τ)-derivation X:A → Aand aC-linear map ˆ τ:M→M(satisfying ˆ τ(fm) =
τ(f)ˆτ(m)). For instance, in the quest to explore connections on the quant um 3-sphere,
[AIL20] and [AIL22] constructed connections satisfying (1.1) with respect to a set of

(σ,τ)-derivations X1,X2,X3appearing naturally as deformations of the Lie algebra of
vector ﬁelds on the 3-sphere. These results motivated the const ruction of a general
framework for noncommutative geometry of twisted derivations d eveloped in [AI22],
introducing the concept of a ( σ,τ)-algebra together with a corresponding notion of
Σ-modules.
In the current work, we introduce the notion of symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations. A
symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivation is a ( σ,τ)-derivation that is alsoa ( τ,σ)-derivation. For ex-
ample, all( σ,τ)-derivations onacommutativealgebraaresymmetric( σ,τ)-derivations.
Basedonsuch( σ,τ)-derivations, weintroducesymmetric( σ,τ)-algebrasandΣ-modules
on which symmetric ( σ,τ)-connections are constructed. To better understand inner
and outer ( σ,τ)-derivations, we introduce the concept of regular and strongly r egular
pairs of endomorphisms. This triggers interesting questions in relat ed to Hochschild
cohomology. In degree one, the Hochschild cohomology group of an associative alge-
bra measures to what extent there exist outer derivations of an a ssociative algebra.
For example, the ﬁrst Hochschild cohomology group of the matrix alg ebra Mat N(C)
in dimension one is zero, implying that there are only inner derivations o n a matrix
algebra. For ( σ,τ)-derivations on an associative algebra, we introduce a ( σ,τ)-version
of Hochschild cohomology for describing the inner and outer ( σ,τ)-derivations on an
associative algebra.
In Section 2 ,we study symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations on an associative algebra and
for example, prove that for a strongly regular pair of endomorphis ms, every symmetric
(σ,τ)-derivation is inner. In Section 3, we deﬁne the ( σ,τ)-Hochschild cohomology
groups of an associative algebra in order to study inner and outer ( σ,τ)-derivations.
In Section 4 ,we study symmetric ( σ,τ)-connections and show that for strongly regu-
lar (σ,τ)-algebras there exist a unique symmetric ( σ,τ)-connection. In Section 5 ,we
explore the curvature of a symmetric ( σ,τ)-connection and its corresponding linearity
properties. Lastly in section 6 ,we illustrate the novel concepts with examples based
on commutative algebras.
2.Symmetric (σ,τ)-derivations
In this Section, we introduce a notion of symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations on associative
algebras. These are ( σ,τ)-derivations that are also ( τ,σ)-derivations. One may think
of symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations as a generalizationof ( σ,τ)-derivations on commutative
algebras (where every ( σ,τ)-derivation is symmetric) to noncommutative algebras. In
the following, we consider a unital associative algebra Aover a ﬁeld Kof characteristic
zero. Let us recall some deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Letσ,τ∈End(A) and let Mbe anA-bimodule. A K-linear map
X:A →Mis called a ( σ,τ)-derivation with values in Mif
(2.1) X(fg) =σ(f)X(g)+X(f)τ(g)
for allf,g∈ A.
Let Der (σ,τ)(A) denote the set of ( σ,τ)-derivations of A. In general, Der (σ,τ)(A) is not
anA-module, but it turns out to be a module over Z(A), the center of A.
Proposition 2.2. Der(σ,τ)(A)is aZ(A)-bimodule.SYMMETRIC ( σ,τ)-ALGEBRAS AND ( σ,τ)-HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY 3
Proof.AssumeXis a (σ,τ)-derivation and let f∈Z(A).Set
(f·X)(a) =fX(a) and ( X·f)(a) =X(a)f
fora∈ A. It is clear that the above action deﬁnes a bimodule structure on De r(σ,τ)(A)
as long as f·XandX·fare (σ,τ)-derivations. For a,b∈ A,one has
f·X(ab) =fX(ab) =fσ(a)X(b)+fX(a)τ(b) =σ(a)fX(b)+fX(a)τ(b)
σ(a)f·X(b)+f·X(a)τ(b)
showing that f·Xis a (σ,τ)-derivation. Similarly, one shows that X·fis a (σ,τ)-
derivation. /square
In the deﬁnition of ( σ,τ)-derivation, one obtains an ordinary derivation (with values
inM) when both σandτare the identity maps on A. A derivation Xis inner if it
can be written as X(f) = [f,g0] =m0f−fm0for some ﬁxed m0∈M. These usually
give an idea of how noncommutative an algebra is. In the case of ( σ,τ)-derivations,
one deﬁnes inner derivations as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.3. A (σ,τ)-derivation Xwith values in Mis called innerif there exists
m0∈Msuch that
X(f) =m0τ(f)−σ(f)m0
for allf∈ A.
Note that although there are no inner derivations on a commutative algebra, in general
there exist inner (nontrivial) ( σ,τ)-derivations on a commutative algebra if σ/\e}atio\slash=τ.
Deﬁnition 2.4. A (σ,τ)-derivation with values in Mis called symmetric if it is also
a (τ,σ)-derivation with values in M.
Let us look at a few examples of symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations. For arbitrary σ,τ∈
End(A) the linear map X:A → Adeﬁned by
X(f) =τ(f)−σ(f) (2.2)
forf∈ Ais a symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivation. Indeed, for f,g∈ A,one has
X(fg) =τ(f)τ(g)−σ(f)σ(g) =τ(f)τ(g)−σ(f)τ(g)+σ(f)τ(g)−σ(f)σ(g)
= (τ(f)−σ(f))τ(g) +σ(f)(τ(g)−σ(g)) =X(f)τ(g)+σ(f)X(g)
showing that Xis a (σ,τ)-derivation. On the other hand, for f,g∈ Aone has
X(fg) =τ(f)τ(g)−σ(f)σ(g) =τ(f)τ(g)−τ(f)σ(g)+τ(f)σ(g)−σ(f)σ(g)
=τ(f)(τ(g)−σ(g))+(τ(f)−σ(f))σ(g) =τ(f)X(g)+X(f)σ(g)
showing that Xis also a ( τ,σ)-derivation. Hence, Xis a symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivation.
The derivation given by (2.2) is an inner ( σ,τ)-derivation which is symmetric. Another
example of a ( σ,τ)-derivation is the Jackson derivative Dqon the polynomial algebra
C[x].The Jackson derivative is deﬁned as
(2.3) Dq(f(x)) =f(qx)−f(x)
(q−1)x
forf(x)∈C[x] andq∈Cwithq/\e}atio\slash= 1.Forf(x),g(x)∈C[x],one has
Dq(f(x)g(x)) =f(qx)Dq(g(x))+Dq(f(x))g(x) =Dq(f(x))g(qx)+f(x)Dq(g(x)).4 KWALOMBOTA ILWALE
With endomorphisms σ(f)(x) =f(qx) andτ(f)(x) =f(x),the Jackson derivative Dq
isasymmetric( σ,τ)-derivation. Thisanexampleof( σ,τ)-derivation onthe polynomial
algebraC[x] which is not inner (see also Section 3.3).
On an associative algebra A,one can generalize (2.2) to construct symmetric inner
(σ,τ)-derivations with values in a bimodule.
Proposition 2.5. Letσ,τ∈End(A)and letMbe anA-bimodule. If m0∈Msuch
that[m0,τ(f)] = [m0,σ(f)] = 0for allf∈ AthenX:A →Mgiven by
X(f) =m0τ(f)−σ(f)m0
forf∈ A, is a symmetric inner (σ,τ)-derivation with values in M.
Proof.By deﬁnition, Xis an inner ( σ,τ)-derivation. We want to show that Xis also
(τ,σ)-derivation. Since [ m0,f] = 0 = [m0,σ(f)] for all f∈ A,one has
X(f) =m0τ(f)−σ(f)m0=τ(f)m0−m0σ(f).
Forf,g∈ A,one has
X(fg) =τ(f)τ(g)m0−τ(f)m0σ(g)+τ(f)m0σ(g)−m0σ(f)σ(g)
=τ(f)(τ(g)m0−m0σ(g))+(τ(f)m0−m0σ(f))σ(g)
=τ(f)X(g)+X(f)σ(g),
showing that Xis a (τ,σ)-derivation. Since we have shown that Xis both ( σ,τ)-
derivation and ( τ,σ)-derivation, it is symmetric. /square
Let us now introduce a notion of regularity for pairs of algebra endo morphisms.
Givenσ,τ∈End(A) we write
δ(f) =τ(f)−σ(f) (2.4)
forf∈ A. In what follows, the properties of δwill be important, and to this end we
introduce the concept of regularity.
Deﬁnition 2.6. Letσ,τ∈End(A). The pair ( σ,τ) is called regularif there exists
f∈ Asuch that δ(f) =τ(f)−σ(f) is not a zero divisor. Moreover, the pair ( σ,τ) is
calledstrongly regular if there exists f∈ Asuch that δ(f) is invertible.
Let us now look at some examples of regular and strongly regular pair s of endomor-
phisms. Let us take, for example, A=C[x],the polynomial algebra in a variable x.
Since there are no zero divisors in C[x],any pair ( σ,τ) such that σ/\e}atio\slash=τis a regular pair
of endomorphisms. Now, let σ(x) =qxandτ(x) =xforq∈C,q/\e}atio\slash= 1. Since σ/\e}atio\slash=τthe
pair (σ,τ) is regular. Moreover, for a polynomial p(x) =/summationtext
i≥0aixi∈C[x],
δ(p)(x) =/summationdisplay
i≥1(1−qi)aixi
is not invertible in C[x].Thus the pair ( σ,τ) such that σ(x) =qxandτ(x) =x,is not a
strongly regular pair of endomorphisms of C[x].On the other hand, given σ(x) =x−h
andτ(x) =x,forh∈C(h/\e}atio\slash= 0), then
δ(x) =h
is invertible in C[x],implying that the pair ( σ,τ) such that σ(x) =x−handτ(x) =x
is a strongly regular pair of endomorphisms over C[x].SYMMETRIC ( σ,τ)-ALGEBRAS AND ( σ,τ)-HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY 5
In the following Lemma, we give a property of symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations that
motivates a relationship between regularpairs ofendomorphisms an d symmetric ( σ,τ)-
derivations.
Lemma 2.7. IfXis a symmetric (σ,τ)-derivation with values in the A-bimodule M,
then
(2.5) X(f)δ(g) =δ(f)X(g)
for allf,g∈ A, whereδ=τ−σ.
Proof.Assume that Xis a symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivation. For f,g∈ A,one has
0 =X(fg)−σ(f)X(g)−X(f)τ(g)
=τ(f)X(g)+X(f)σ(g)−σ(f)X(g)−X(f)τ(g)
= (τ(f)−σ(f))X(g)+X(f)(σ(g)−τ(g))
=δ(f)X(g)−X(f)δ(g),
implying that
X(f)δ(g) =δ(f)X(g). /square
Proposition 2.8. Let(σ,τ)be a strongly regular pair of endomorphisms of Aand
letXbe a symmetric (σ,τ)-derivation with values in the A-bimodule M. Then there
exists a unique m0∈Msuch that
X(f) =m0τ(f)−σ(f)m0
and
[m0,τ(f)] = [m0,σ(f)] = 0
for allf∈ A.
Proof.SinceXis a symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivation, one concludes from Lemma 2.7 that
X(f)δ(g) =δ(f)X(g) (2.6)
for allf,g∈ A. Since (σ,τ) is assumed to be a strongly regularpair of endomorphisms,
there exists g0∈ Asuch that δ(g0) is invertible. It then follows from (2.6) that
(2.7) X(f) =δ(f)X(g0)δ(g0)−1
for allf∈ A. Setm0=X(g0)δ(g0)−1, use (2.7) to compute
0 =X(fg)−σ(f)X(g)−X(f)τ(g) =δ(fg)m0−σ(f)δ(g)m0−δ(f)m0τ(g)

=τ(f)[τ(g),m0]−σ(f)[τ(g),m0] =δ(f)[τ(g),m0],
and setting f=g0, implying that δ(g0) is invertible, gives [ τ(g),m0] = 0 for all g∈ A.
Similarly, the identity
0 =X(fg)−τ(f)X(g)−X(f)σ(g)
implies that [ σ(g),m0] = 0 for all g∈ A. It follows that
X(f) =δ(f)m0=m0δ(f) =m0τ(f)−σ(f)m0.6 KWALOMBOTA ILWALE
Finally, let us prove that m0is unique. To this end, assume that
X(f) =δ(f)m0=δ(f)n0
for allf∈ A, implying that δ(f)(m0−n0) = 0 for all f∈ A. Setting f=g0gives
m0=n0sinceδ(g0) is invertible. /square

3. (σ,τ)-Hochschild Cohomology
The notion of Hochschild cohomology was ﬁrst introduced in [Hoc45]. H ochschild co-
homologytheoryin lowdimension is concernedwith derivationsof asso ciativealgebras.
For instance, the ﬁrst cohomology group determines the outer de rivations of the al-
gebra. In this Section, we introduce a ( σ,τ)-version of Hochschild cohomology, which
we refer to as ( σ,τ)-Hochschild cohomology. The ( σ,τ)-Hochschild cohomology will be
deﬁned as the Hochschild cohomology with coeﬃcients in a particular t wisted bimod-
ule, which we denote as M(σ,τ).In this case of the Hochschild cohomology, 1-cocycles
are (σ,τ)-derivations and 1-coboundaries are inner ( σ,τ)-derivations. Therefore, ﬁrst
(σ,τ)-Hochschild cohomologygroup, which we denote by H1
(σ,τ)(A,M), determines the
outer (σ,τ)-derivations. Let us ﬁrst look at the preliminaries before we go into details.
3.1.Hochschild cohomology preliminaries. LetA⊗n=A⊗C···⊗CAbe then-
fold tensor product of Aand letMbe anA-bimodule. A C-linear map ω:A⊗n→M
is called an n-cochain of an algebra Awith values in Mand the linear space of all n-
cochainsis denoted Cn(A,M) forn≥1.Forn= 0,letC0(A,M) =M.TheHochschild
cochain complex of Awith coeﬃcients in M, denoted C∗(A,M,δ) is the sequence of
linear spaces of cochains
0→M→C1(A,M)→C2(A,M)→ ··· → Cn(A,M)→Cn+1(A,M)→ ···
together with the diﬀerentials δn:Cn(A,M)→Cn+1(A,M), deﬁned by
(δ0m)(a) =ma−am
form∈Manda∈A, and
(δnω)(a1,...,a n+1) =a1ω(a2,...,a n+1)+n/summationdisplay
j=1(−1)jω(a1,...,a jaj+1,...,a n+1)
+(−1)n+1ω(a1,...,a n)an+1
forω∈Cn(A,M) andn≥1. One shows that δn◦δn−1= 0.
Ann-cochain ωis called n-cocycle if δω= 0,and it is called an n-coboundary if
there exist an( n−1)-cochain ρsuch that ω=δρ.The set of n-cocyclesform asubgroup
of the additive group of n-cochains. The n-dimensional cohomology group of Awith
coeﬃcients in M, denoted by Hn(A,M),isthe groupof n-dimensionalcocyclesmodulo
the subgroup of n-dimensional coboundaries. Namely, denoting by Zn(A,M) the set
ofn-cocycles, i.e.
Zn(A,M) ={ω∈Cn(A,M) :δω= 0}SYMMETRIC ( σ,τ)-ALGEBRAS AND ( σ,τ)-HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY 7
and denoting by Bn(A,M) the set of n-coboundaries, i.e.
Bn(A,M) ={ω∈Cn(A,M) :ω=δρ,forρ∈Cn−1(A,M)},
one deﬁnes
Hn(A,M) =Zn(A,M)/Bn(A,M).
Now, let us examine the cohomology groups for the cases when n= 0,1.Forn= 0,
the Hochschild cohomology group is given by
H0(A,M) = ker(δ0) ={m∈M:ma=am,fora∈ A},
which is simply the center of M.Forn= 1,one considers
(δ1ω)(a1,a2) =a1ω(a2)−ω(a1a2)+ω(a1)a2
forω∈C1(A,M) and the boundary map
(δ0m)(a1) = [m,a1],
fora1,a2∈ A,m∈M.Given that ω∈ker(δ1),then one has
ω(a1a2) =a1ω(a2)+ω(a1)a2
implying that the linear map ω:A →Mis a derivation of Awith values in M.One
writes
Z1(A,M) ={ω∈C1(A,M) :ω(ab) =aω(b)+ω(a)b∀a,b∈ A}= Der(A,M),
where Der( A,M) denotes the set of all derivations of Awith values in M.Forωin the
image of δ0,one has
B1(A,M) ={ω∈C1(A,M) :ω= (δ0m)(a) = [m,a],∀a∈ A}= Inn(A,M),
where Inn( A,M) denotes the set of inner derivations of Awith values in M.Thus, it
follows that
H1(A,M) =Z1(A,M)/B1(A,M) = Der(A,M)/Inn(A,M),
represents the set of outer derivations of Awith values in M.
3.2. (σ,τ)-Hochschild cohomology. LetAbe an associative algebra and Mbe an
A-bimodule. Given σ,τ∈End(A), we will construct a new A-bimodule structure on
M, denoted by M(σ,τ), by twisting the action on Mby the endomorphisms σandτ.
Namely, let
f·m=σ(f)m, m·f=mτ(f)
forf∈ Aandm∈M.It is easy to show that M(σ,τ)is again an A-bimodule. We
want to compute the Hochschild cohomology group of Awith values in M(σ,τ).The
boundary map δn:Cn(A,M(σ,τ))→Cn+1(A,M(σ,τ)) is now obtained as
(δ0m)(a) =m·a−a·m=mτ(a)−σ(a)m8 KWALOMBOTA ILWALE

j=1(−1)jω(a2,...,a jaj+1,...,a n+1)

forn≥1. In particular, for n= 1 one obtains
(δ1ω)(a1,a2) =σ(a1)ω(a2)+ω(a1)τ(a2)−ω(a1a2)
implying that a 1-cocycle ω∈C1(A,M(σ,τ)) is a (σ,τ)-derivation with values in M.
Let us denote by Der (σ,τ)(A,M) and Inn (σ,τ)(A,M) the set of all ( σ,τ)-derivations and
the set of all inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of Awith values in Mrespectively. Then one sets
Zn
(σ,τ)(A,M) =Zn(A,M(σ,τ))
Bn
(σ,τ)(A,M) =Bn(A,M(σ,τ))
noting that
Z1
(σ,τ)(A,M) = Der (σ,τ)(A,M),
B1
(σ,τ)(A,M) = Inn (σ,τ)(A,M).
Hence, the Hochschild cohomology groups of Awith values in M(σ,τ)are deﬁned as
Hn
(σ,τ)(A,M) =Zn
(σ,τ)(A,M)/Bn
(σ,τ)(A,M).
Let us now consider the ( σ,τ)-Hochschild cohomology groups, for n= 0,1.Forn= 0
one has
H0
(σ,τ)(A,M) ={m∈M(σ,τ):mτ(a) =σ(a)m,fora∈ A}.
Proposition 3.1. LetAbe a commutative algebra and (σ,τ)be a regular pair. Then
H0
(σ,τ)(A,A) = 0.
Proof.Letb∈H0
(σ,τ)(A,A),thenbδ(a) = 0 for a∈ A(using that Ais commutative).
Moreover, since ( σ,τ) is a regular pair, there exists a0∈ Asuch that δ(a0) is not a
zero divisor. Then
bδ(a0) = 0⇒b= 0.
Hence,H0
(σ,τ)(A,A) = 0. /square
Forn= 1,(δ1ω)(a1,a2) = 0 implies that
ω(a1a2) =σ(a1)ω(a2)+ω(a1)τ(a2)
showing that ω∈Z1
(σ,τ)(A,M) is a (σ,τ)-derivation. For ω∈C1(A,M(σ,τ)) such that
ω= (δ0m)(a) =mτ(a)−σ(a)mSYMMETRIC ( σ,τ)-ALGEBRAS AND ( σ,τ)-HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY 9
implies that ω∈B1
(σ,τ)(A,M) is an inner ( σ,τ)-derivation. Hence
H1
(σ,τ)(A,M) = Der (σ,τ)(A,M)/Inn(σ,τ)(A,M)
constitute all outer ( σ,τ)-derivations of Awith values in M.WhenM=Awe shall
simply write H1
(σ,τ)(A) =H1
(σ,τ)(A,A). Note that if H1
(σ,τ)(A) = 0 then every ( σ,τ)-
derivation is inner.
Let us now consider a few cases where one can determine the ( σ,τ)-cohomology in
lower degrees. First of all, it follows immediately from Corollary 2.9 that H1
(σ,τ)(A,M)
vanishes for strongly regular symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations, which we state as follows.
Proposition 3.2. Letσ,τ∈End(A)be such that (σ,τ)is a strongly regular pair of
endomorphisms. If every (σ,τ)-derivation on Awith values in Mis symmetric, then
H1
(σ,τ)(A,M) =H1
(τ,σ)(A,M) = 0.
Inparticular,foracommutativealgebra A, every(σ,τ)-derivationissymmetricandone
can conclude that H1
(σ,τ)(A) = 0 if ( σ,τ) is a strongly regular pair of endomorphisms.
3.3.Examples of (σ,τ)-Hochchild cohomology. LetA=K[x],be the polyno-
mial algebra in the indeterminate xover the ﬁeld K.Both the zero and one dimen-
sional Hochschild cohomology of K[x] is isomorphic to K[x],i.e.,H0(K[x])≃K[x]
andH1(K[x])≃K[x]d
dx. (see for example [Wit20]). In this section we describe the
(σ,τ)-Hochschild cohomology groups in degree 0 and 1.
In degree 0, one can apply Proposition 3.1, assuming that σ/\e}atio\slash=τ. In that case, there
exists a polynomial p0∈K[x] such that δ(p0)/\e}atio\slash= 0 implying that δ(p0) is not a zero
divisor since K[x] is an integral domain. Hence
H0
(σ,τ)(K[x]) = 0.
Next, let us consider H1
(σ,τ)(K[x]).
Proposition 3.3. Letσ,τ∈End(K[x])and letδ=τ−σ. Then
H1
(σ,τ)(K[x]) =K[x]/Iδ,
where
Iδ={p(x)δ(x) :p(x)∈K[x]}
is the ideal generated by δ(x).
Proof.InK[x],a (σ,τ)-derivation Xis completely determined by
X(x) =f0(x)∈K[x]
and, conversely, any such choice of f0∈K[x] gives a ( σ,τ)-derivation by using the

(σ,τ)(K[x])≃K[x], where the isomorphism is
provided by X/mapsto→X(x) =f0(x). Now if X∈B1
(σ,τ)(K[x]) then
X(x) =g0(x)(τ(x)−σ(x)) =g0(x)δ(x),
for some g0∈K[x], implying that

(σ,τ)(K[x])≃Iδ.

To illustrate the above result, let us apply it to a particular case.

Corollary 3.5. The Jackson derivative is an outer (σ,τ)-derivation of K[x].
Proof.InK[x], every ( σ,τ)-derivation Xis determined by X(x) =f0(x)∈K[x].Let
Xbe the Jackson derivative. It is easy to show that Xis a (σ,τ)-derivation with
σ(x) =qxandτ(x) =xandX(x) = 1.Since the Jackson derivative is determined by
f0(x) = 1 then by Proposition 3.4, it is an outer derivation of K[x]. /square
Next, let A= Mat N(C) be the algebra of ( N×N) complex matrices. If σ,τ∈End(A)
are automorphisms, one can easily describe H0
στ(MatN(C)).
Proposition 3.6. Ifσ,τ∈Aut(MatN(C))thenH0
(σ,τ)/parenleftbig
MatN(C)/parenrightbig
≃C.
Proof.Since Mat N(C) is a central simple algebra, the Skolem-Noether theorem implies
that all automorphisms are inner; that is, there exist U,V∈MatN(C) (unique up to
multiplication by a complex number) such that τ(A) =U−1AUandσ(A) =V−1AV
for allA∈MatN(C). By deﬁnition
H0
(σ,τ)(MatN(C)) ={A∈MatN(C) :Aτ(B) =σ(B)A∀B∈MatN(C)},
and one computes
Aτ(B) =σ(B)A⇔AU−1BU=V−1BVA⇔[VAU−1,B] = 0.
For the above relation to be true for all B∈MatN(C) one necessarily has that
VAU−1=z1Nfor some z∈C, where1Ndenotes the identity matrix. Thus, it
follows that
H0
(σ,τ)/parenleftbig
MatN(C)/parenrightbig
={zV−1U:z∈C} ≃C. /square
It is well known that all derivations on Mat N(C) are inner, implying that
H1
(σ,τ)(MatN(C)) = 0.
Moreover, it is a fact that Hn(MatN(C),M) = 0 for n≥1 and arbitrary bimodule M
(see e.g. [Red01]), implying the following result.SYMMETRIC ( σ,τ)-ALGEBRAS AND ( σ,τ)-HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY 11
Proposition 3.7. Let Mat N(C)denote the algebra of N×Ncomplex matrices, and
letMbe a Mat N(C)-bimodule. Then
Hn
(σ,τ)(MatN(C),M) = 0
forn≥1.
Proof.Since for any bimodule Mandn≥1 one has Hn(MatN(C),M) = 0, it follows
that
H1
(σ,τ)(MatN(C),M) =H1(MatN(C),M(σ,τ)) = 0. /square
In particular, the above result implies that every( σ,τ)-derivation on Mat N(C) is inner.
4.Symmetric (σ,τ)-algebras
Theframeworktostudy( σ,τ)-connectionson( σ,τ)-algebrashasbeenstudiedin[AI22],
[AIL20] and [AIL22]. In this Section, we extend the framework to ac commodate sym-
metric (σ,τ)-derivations already introduced in Section 2 .To this eﬀect, we introduce
symmetric( σ,τ)-algebrasandsymmetric( σ,τ)-connections andstudyhowthestrongly
regular condition of endomorphisms in a ( σ,τ)-algebra inﬂuence such connections. Let
us recall a few basic deﬁnitions from [AI22].
Deﬁnition 4.1. A (σ,τ)-algebra Σ = ( A,{Xa}a∈I) is a pair where Ais an associative
algebra and Xais a (σa,τa)-derivation of Afora∈I.
Deﬁnition 4.2. For a (σ,τ)-algebra Σ = ( A,{Xa}a∈I),we letTΣ⊆HomC(A,A) be
the vector space generated by {Xa}a∈I. We call TΣ thetangent space of Σ.
Recall that a pair ( σ,τ) of endomorphisms is strongly regular if there exists f0∈ A
such that δ(f0) =τ(f0)−σ(f0) is invertible. In a ( σ,τ)-algebra, there are several
pairs of endomorphisms, and for each ( σ,τ)-derivation Xain the (σ,τ)-algebra, there
are pairs ( σa,τa) fora∈I.We would like to consider the case that all the pairs of
endomorphisms in the ( σ,τ)-algebra are simultaneously strongly regular, i.e., there
existfa∈ Afora∈Isuch that δa(fa) =τa(fa)−σa(fa) is invertible. We shall call
a (σ,τ)-algebra with this property strongly regular. Similarly, if each ( σ,τ)-derivation
in the (σ,τ)-algebra is symmetric, we shall call the ( σ,τ)-algebra symmetric. In the
following, we give precise deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 4.3. A (σ,τ)-algebra Σ = ( A,{Xa}a∈I) is called (strongly) regular if
(σa,τa) is a (strongly) regular pair of endomorphisms of Afor alla∈I.
Deﬁnition 4.4. A symmetric ( σ,τ)-algebra Σ = ( A,{Xa}a∈I) is a (σ,τ)-algebra such
thatXais a symmetric ( σa,τa)-derivation for a∈I.
Note that if Ais a commutative algebra, then any ( σ,τ)-algebra Σ = ( A,{Xa}a∈I) is
symmetric since ( σ,τ)-derivations on commutative algebras are symmetric. For such
an algebra to be a regular ( σ,τ)-algebra, one may consider the case when the algebra
has no zero divisors and σa/\e}atio\slash=τafor alla∈I.Again, this is possible because then
δa(fa) =τa(fa)−σa(fA)/\e}atio\slash= 0 for some fa∈ A. To obtain a strongly regular algebra,
one takes for example, the algebra K[x] of polynomials in one variable xand assumes
thatσa=σwithσ(p)(x) =p(x−h) forh∈Kandp(x)∈Kand assume that τa=τ
withτ(p)(x) =p(x).In this case each pair ( σa,τa) is strongly regular in K[x].
Let us now recall the deﬁnition of modules over ( σ,τ)-algebras.12 KWALOMBOTA ILWALE
Deﬁnition4.5. LetΣ = ( A,{Xa}a∈I)bea(σ,τ)-algebra. A leftΣ-module(M,{(ˆσa,ˆτa)}a∈I)
is a leftA-module Mtogether with C-linear maps ˆ σa,ˆτa:M→Msuch that
ˆσa(fm) =σa(f)ˆσ(m)
ˆτa(fm) =τa(f)ˆτa(m)
forf∈ A,m∈Manda∈I.
Similarly, one deﬁnes right Σ-modules as well as Σ-bimodules (cf. [AI22 ]). Let now us
recall a few examples of Σ-modules.
Example 4.6. LetΣ = (A,{Xa}a∈I)be a(σ,τ)-algebra and let Anbe a free left A-
module with basis {ei}, i= 1,...,n.One introduces a canonical Σ-module structure on
Anby setting
ˆσ0
a(m) =σa(mi)ei,ˆτ0
a(m) =τa(mi)ei
wherem=miei∈ An(summation over ifrom1tonis implied). Now, let f∈ Aand
m∈ An,one has
ˆσ0
a(fm) =σa(fmi)ei=σa(f)σa(mi)ei=σa(f)ˆσ0
a(m)
ˆτ0
a(fm) =τa(fmi)ei=τa(f)τa(mi)ei=τa(f)ˆτ0
a(m),
showing that (An,{(ˆσ0
a,ˆτ0
a)}a∈i)is a leftΣ-module.
The example above is an example of a free Σ-module. Let us now look an example of
a Σ-module which is not free.
Example 4.7. LetA=MatN(C),the algebra of complex (N×N)-matrices and let
Σ = (A,{Xa}n
a=1)whereXa:MatN(C)→MatN(C)is given by
Xa(A) =A−σa(A)
with endomorphism σa(A) =UaAU−1
aforA∈MatN(C)and some complex (N×N)-
matrices Uasuch that [Ua,Ub] = 0fora,b= 1,...,n.ThenXais a(σa,Id)-derivation
and(MatN(C),{(σa,Id)}n
a=1)is a free Σ-module.
According to [AI22], applying an appropriate projector to any Σ-module, one obtains
a projective Σ-module. Let p=v0v†
0forv0∈CNwith|v0|= 1be the projector. Then
(MatN(C)p,{(ˆσa,ˆτa)}n
a=1), withˆσa(A) =σa(A)pandˆτa(A) =Ap, is a projective Σ-
module and one notes that Mat N(C)pis isomorphic to CN, which is not a free left
MatN(C)-module.
Now, let us recall the deﬁnition of ( σ,τ)-connections on Σ-modules.
Deﬁnition 4.8. Let Σ = ( A,{Xa}a∈I) be a (σ,τ)-algebra and let ( M,{(ˆσa,ˆτa)}a∈I)
be a left Σ-module. A left ( σ,τ)-connection on Mis amap ∇:TΣ×M→Msatisfying
∇X(m1+m2) =∇Xm1+∇Xm2
∇X(λm) =λ∇Xm
∇X+Ym=∇Xm+∇Ym
∇λXm=λ∇Xm

for allX,Y∈TΣ,m,m1,m2∈M,λ∈C, f∈ Aanda∈I.SYMMETRIC ( σ,τ)-ALGEBRAS AND ( σ,τ)-HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY 13
Analogously, a right ( σ,τ)-connection on a right Σ-module ( M,{(ˆσa,ˆτa)}a∈I) satisﬁes
∇Xa(mf) = ˆσa(m)Xa(f)+/parenleftbig
∇Xam/parenrightbig
τa(f),
in addition to the linearity properties. Moreover, if Mis a (σ,τ)-bimodule and ∇is
a left (σ,τ)-connection, as well as a right ( σ,τ)-connection, we say that ∇is a (σ,τ)-
bimodule connection (cf. [AI22]).
Wewouldliketointroducea( σ,τ)-connectioninvolvingsymmetric( σ,τ)-derivations.
Since symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations satisfy two Leibniz rules and one thinks of ( σ,τ)-
connectionsascovariantderivativesinthedirectionofthe( σ,τ)-derivation, itisnatural
to have a notion of symmetric ( σ,τ)-connection satisfying two Leibniz rules in corre-
spondence to those of the symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations. In the following, we deﬁne
symmetric ( σ,τ)-connections and discuss such connections on (strongly) regula r and
symmetric ( σ,τ)-algebras.
Deﬁnition 4.9. Let Σ = ( A,{Xa}a∈I) be a (σ,τ)-algebra and let ( M,{(ˆσa,ˆτa)}a∈I)
be a left Σ-module. A left ( σ,τ)-connection on Mis called symmetric if
∇Xa(fm) =τa(f)∇Xam+Xa(f)ˆσa(m) (4.1)
for alla∈Iandm∈M.
On Σ-bimodules, it is easy to construct connections corresponding to inner ( σ,τ)-
derivations.
Proposition 4.10. LetΣ = (A,{Xa}a∈I)be a(σ,τ)-algebra such that Xais an inner
(σa,τa)-derivation for all a∈I; i.e there exist {fa}a∈I⊆ Asuch that
Xa(f) =faτa(f)−σa(f)fa
fora∈I. If(M,{(ˆσa,ˆτa)}a∈I)is aΣ-bimodule then
∇Xa(m) =faˆτa(m)−ˆσa(m)fa
deﬁnes a (σ,τ)-bimodule connection on (M,{(ˆσa,ˆτa)}a∈I).
Proof.It iseasyto showlinearityin TΣandMis satisﬁed. Let usshowthat ∇satisﬁes
both the left and the right twisted Leibniz rule. For f∈ Aandm∈M,one has
∇Xa(fm) =faˆτa(fm)−ˆσa(fm)fa=faτa(f)ˆτa(m)−σa(f)ˆσa(m)fa
=σa(f)faˆτa(m)−σa(f)ˆσa(m)fa+faτa(f)ˆτa(m)−σa(f)faˆτa(m)
=σa(f)(faˆτa(m)−ˆσa(m)fa)+(faτa(f)−σa(f)fa)ˆτa(m)
=σa(f)∇Xa(m)+Xa(f)ˆτa(m),
showing that ∇satisﬁes the left twisted Leibniz rule. In a similar manner, Let us chec k
that∇satisﬁes the right twisted Leibniz rule. One has
∇Xa(mf) =faˆτa(mf)−ˆσa(mf)fa=faˆτa(m)τa(f)−ˆσa(m)σa(f)fa
= ˆσa(m)faτa(f)−ˆσa(m)σa(f)fa+faˆτa(m)τa(f)−ˆσa(m)faτa(f)
= ˆσa(m)(faτa(f)−σa(f)fa)+(faˆτa(m)−ˆσa(m)fa)τa(f)
= ˆσa(m)Xa(f)+∇Xa(m)τa(f)./square14 KWALOMBOTA ILWALE
Now, let ( A,{Xa}a∈I) be a symmetric strongly regular ( σ,τ)-algebra; it follows from
Proposition 2.8 that there exists {fa}a∈I⊆ Asuch that [ fa,σa(f)] = [fa,τa(f)] = 0
and
Xa(f) =faδa(f) =fa/parenleftbig
τa(f)−σa(f)/parenrightbig
forf∈ A. Given a (left) Σ-module ( M,{ˆσa,ˆτa}a∈I) one can easily check that
∇Xam=faˆδa(m) =fa/parenleftbig
ˆτa(m)−ˆσa(m)/parenrightbig
deﬁnes a symmetric left ( σ,τ)-connection on ( M,{ˆσa,ˆτa}a∈I). The following result
states that this every symmetric ( σ,τ)-connection on a strongly regular symmetric
(σ,τ)-algebra is of this form.
Proposition 4.11. LetΣ = (A,{Xa}a∈I)be a strongly regular symmetric (σ,τ)-
algebra and write
Xa(f) =faδa(f) =fa/parenleftbig
τa(f)−σa(f)/parenrightbig
forfa∈ Asuch that [fa,τa(f)] = [fa,σa(f)] = 0.If∇is a (left) symmetric (σ,τ)-
connection on a Σ-module (M,{ˆσa,ˆτa}a∈I)then
∇Xa(m) =faˆδa(m) =fa/parenleftbig

Proof.Since∇is assumed to be symmetric, one has
0 =∇Xa(fm)−∇Xa(fm)
=σa(f)∇Xam+Xa(f)ˆτa(m)−τa(f)∇Xam−Xa(f)ˆσa(m)
= (σa(f)−τa(f))∇Xam+Xa(f)(ˆτa(m)−ˆσa(m))
=−δa(f)∇Xam+Xa(f)ˆδa(m).
Using that Xa(f) =faδa(f) together with [ fa,δa(f)] = 0, it follows that
δa(f)/parenleftbig
∇Xam−faˆδa(m)/parenrightbig
= 0 (4.2)
forf∈ Aandm∈M. Since (σ,τ) is a strongly regular pair, there exists ga∈ Asuch
thatδ(ga) is invertible. Thus, setting f=gain (4.2) gives
∇Xam=faˆδa(m)

Let us summarize these results in the following corollary.
Corollary 4.12. LetΣ = (A,{Xa}a∈I)be a strongly regular symmetric (σ,τ)-algebra
and let(M,{ˆσa,ˆτa}a∈I)be a left Σ-module. Then there exists a unique symmetric left
(σ,τ)-connection on (M,{ˆσa,ˆτa}a∈I).SYMMETRIC ( σ,τ)-ALGEBRAS AND ( σ,τ)-HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY 15
5.Curvature
Curvature of ( σ,τ)-connections was deﬁned in [AI22]. In this Section, we explore the
possibility of curvatures of symmetric ( σ,τ)-connections to satisfy a twisted linearity
condition. In classical diﬀerential geometry, curvature of conne ctions are discussed
with reference to the Lie-algebra structure induced by vector ﬁe lds on a manifold. In
the case of ( σ,τ)-connections, the curvature is discussed with reference to the (σ,τ)-Lie
algebra structure. Let us recall a few deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let Σ = ( A,{Xa}a∈I) be a (σ,τ)-algebra and let TΣ denote the
complex vector space generated by {Xa}a∈I.Given aC-bilinear map R:TΣ⊗CTΣ→
TΣ⊗CTΣ,we say that ( TΣ,R) is a (σ,τ)-Lie algebra if
(1)R2=idTΣ⊗CTΣ,
(2)m(Xa⊗CXb−R(Xa⊗CXb))∈TΣ,
for alla,b∈I,wherem:TΣ⊗CTΣ→EndC(A)denotes the composition map given
bym(Xa⊗CXb) =Xa◦Xb.
Given a ( σ,τ)-Lie algebra ( TΣ,R) one introduces the bracket [ ·,·]R:TΣ×TΣ→TΣ
as
[X,Y]R=m(Xa⊗CXb−R(Xa⊗CXb))
forX,Y∈TΣ. Moreover, if Iis a ﬁnite set, one introduces the components of R, as
well as structure constants Cp
ab∈C, as
[Xa,Xb]R=Rpq
abXp⊗Xq=Cp
abXp
(where summation over repeated indices is implied). Now, let us recall the deﬁnition
of curvature with respect to a ( σ,τ)-Lie algebra structure on TΣ.
Deﬁnition 5.2. Let Σ = ( A,{Xa}a∈I) be a (σ,τ)-algebra, such that ( TΣ,R) is a
(σ,τ)-Lie algebra, and let ( M,{(ˆσa,ˆτa)}a∈I) be a Σ-module. Given a ( σ,τ)-connection
∇,the curvature of ∇is deﬁned as
Curv(X,Y)n=m∇(X⊗CY−R(X⊗CY))n−∇[X,Y]Rn
forn∈MandX,Y∈TΣ,wherem∇(X⊗CY) =∇X◦∇Y.
In components, the curvature can be written as
Curv(Xa,Xb) =∇Xa◦∇Xb−Rpq

ab∇Xp.
Letusnowdiscussthelinearitypropertiesofcurvatureof( σ,τ)-connections. Ingeneral,
the curvatureof( σ,τ)-connections doesnot satisfyanylinearityproperty. Thelinearit y
property of curvature can be satisﬁed depending on how the map Ron the (σ,τ)-Lie
algebra is deﬁned, how the endomorphisms σa’s andτa’s on the algebra interact and
how the maps ˆ τa’s on the Σ-module interact with the connection. For example, for16 KWALOMBOTA ILWALE
f∈ Aandm∈M,one has
Curv(Xa,Xb)(fm) =∇Xa(∇Xb(fm))−Rpq
ab∇Xp(∇Xq(fm))−Cp

Despite that the curvature of a general ( σ,τ)-connection potrays no linearity property
in general,forspeciﬁc( σ,τ)-Lie algebraorspeciﬁc ( σ,τ)-connections, the curvaturecan
satisfy a linearity property. For example in [AI22], the curvature of a (σ,τ)-connection
on a matrix algebra satisﬁes a certain twisted linearity property. To this eﬀect, let us
consider curvature of a general ( σ,τ)-connection with reference to a speciﬁc ( σ,τ)-Lie
algebra. Assume that
Rpq
ab=δq
aδp
b=/braceleftbigg1 ifa=q,b=p,
0 otherwise,
andCp
ab= 0 for all a,b∈I.Then the bracket on the generators of ( TΣ,R) is
[Xa,Xb]R=Xa◦Xb−Xb◦Xa= 0, (5.1)
implying that the curvature of a ( σ,τ)-connection ∇can now be written as
Curv(Xa,Xb) =∇Xa◦∇Xb−∇Xb◦∇Xa.
Proposition 5.3. LetΣ = (A,{Xa}a∈I)be a(σ,τ)-algebra such that (TΣ,R)is the
(σ,τ)-Lie algebra with bracket
[Xa,Xb]R=Xa◦Xb−Xb◦Xa= 0
and let(M,{(ˆσa,ˆτa)}a∈I)be a left Σ-module. If ∇:TΣ×M→Mis a left (σ,τ)-
connection and
[σa,σb] = 0 = [σa,Xb], (5.2)
[ˆτa,ˆτb] = 0 = [ˆτa,∇Xb]
for alla,b∈I,then
Curv(Xa,Xb(fm)) =σa(σb(f))Curv(Xa,Xb)m (5.3)
forf∈ Aandm∈M.
Proof.Since the ( σ,τ)-Lie algebra bracket is given by (5.1), the curvature is written
as
Curv(Xa,Xb) =∇Xa◦∇Xb−∇Xb◦∇Xa.SYMMETRIC ( σ,τ)-ALGEBRAS AND ( σ,τ)-HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY 17
Now, for f∈ Aandm∈M,and applying the commutation relations (5.2), one has
Curv(Xa,Xb)(fm) =∇Xa(∇Xb(fm))−∇Xb(∇Xa(fm))
=∇Xa(σb(f)∇Xb(m)+Xb(f)ˆτb(m))−∇Xb(σa(f)∇Xa(m)+Xa(f)ˆτa(m))
=σa(σb(f))∇Xa(∇Xb(m))+Xa(σb(f))ˆτa(∇Xb(m))+σa(Xb(f))∇Xa(ˆτb(m))

−Xb(Xa(f))ˆτb(ˆτa(m))
=σa(σb(f))(∇Xa(∇Xb(m))−∇Xb(∇Xa(m)))
= (σa◦σb)(f))Curv(Xa,Xb)m,
showing the twisted linearity property. /square
From the Proposition above, not all left ( σ,τ)-connections have a curvature that satis-
ﬁesthetwistedlinearityproperty(5.3). Thecommutationrelations (5.2)ofProposition
5.3 restricts the left ( σ,τ)-connections to be considered due to that the connection is
required to commute with the maps ˆ τafor alla,i.e., [ˆτa,∇Xb] = 0 for all a,b.In
this Proposition, we would like curvature to satisfy the twisted linear ity property (5.3)
without much restrictions on the left ( σ,τ)-connection. However, this may impose ad-
ditional conditions on the endomorphisms and the ( σ,τ)-derivations. Let us take for
example, the left ( σ,τ)-connection given by ∇Xa(ei) =γk
aiekwithγk
ai∈ A, deﬁned on
the free Σ-module of Example 4.6. One has
[ˆτa,∇Xb](miei) = ˆτa(∇Xb(miei))−∇Xb(τa(mi)ei)
=τa(σb(mi))τa(γk
bi)ek+τa(Xb(mi))ei−σb(τa(mi))γk
biek−Xb(τa(mi))ei
= (τa(σb(mi))τa(γk
bi)−σb(τa(mi))γk
bi+τa(Xb(mk))−Xb(τa(mk)))ek,
which does not equal zero naturally without imposing further condit ions. In this
example, one may choose the additional condition [ τa,σb] = 0 = [ τa,Xb] and set
τa(γk
bi) =γk
bi,for alla,b.To stick to the conditions in Proposition 5.3 and to the ad-
ditional conditions imposed by the example above, it is natural to cho oseτa= Id to
get a curvature that satisﬁes the twisted linearity property. In t he following Corollary,
the curvature of all left ( σ,Id)-connections for the said ( σ,τ)-Lie algebra satisﬁes the
twisted linearity property.
Corollary 5.4. LetΣ = (A,{Xa}a∈Ibe a(σ,τ)-algebra such that (TΣ,R)is a(σ,τ)-
Lie algebra with bracket
[Xa,Xb]R=Xa◦Xb−Xb◦Xa= 0
such that Xais a(σa,Id)-derivation satisfying
[σa,σb] = 0 = [σa,Xb] (5.4)
fora,b∈I.Then it follows that the curvature of all left (σ,Id)-connections on the
Σ-module (M,{(ˆσa,Id)}a∈I)satisfy the twisted linearity property

Let us now discuss the curvature of the unique symmetric ( σ,τ)-connection of Propo-
sition 4.11. Recall that the unique connection ∇Xa(m) =faˆδa(m) is deﬁned on a
strongly regular symmetric ( σ,τ)-algebra ( A,{Xa}a∈I) where Xa=faδaare inner
(σ,τ)-derivations for a∈I.Choosing ˆ σa= ˆτa= Id leaves the connection trivial. We
would like to focus on the special case when ˆ σa/\e}atio\slash= ˆτa= Id and fa∈C,fora∈I.To
this end, let Σ = ( A,{Xa}a∈I) be the strongly regular symmetric ( σ,τ)-algebra where
Xa=faδa=fa(Id−σa) forfa∈Canda∈I.In this case the vector space TΣ is

implying that R2= Id.Assuming that [ σa,σb] = 0,one has
[Xa,Xb]R=m(Xa⊗CXb−R(Xa⊗CXb)) =fafb(δa◦δb−δb◦δa) = 0,
showing that the bracket, [ Xa,Xb]R= 0,on the (σ,τ)-Lie algebra ( TΣ,R).Let us
compute the curvature of the unique connection for the ( σ,τ)-algebra described above.
Since [Xa,Xb]R= 0,then∇[Xa,Xb]R](m) = 0 for m∈MandXa,Xb∈TΣ,and the
curvature of the unique connection is
Curv(Xa,Xb)m=fafb(ˆδa◦ˆδb−ˆδb◦ˆδa)(m).
We remarkthat the curvature aboveis not zero in general becaus e [σa,σb] = 0 does not
imply [ˆσa,ˆσb] = 0.GivenCorollary5.4, onechecksthatthe commutationrelations(5.4)
are satisﬁed on the ( σ,τ)-algebra and since the bracket [ Xa,Xb]R= 0,one concludes
that the unique ( σ,Id)-connection satisﬁes the twisted linearity condition (5.3).
Let us now review the example of a ( σ,τ)-connection over the matrix algebra
MatN(C), constructed in [AI22], and relate it to symmetric ( σ,τ)-connections.

Let us show that the left ( σ,Id)-connection (5.5) is a symmetric left ( σ,τ)-connection.
Let us take the same ( σ,τ)-algebra Σ = (Mat N(C),{Xa}a∈I) and the same free module
MatN(C).Now deﬁne the maps ˆ σa: MatN(C)→MatN(C) by ˆσa(A) =UaAU−1
aΓa

a=1) is a left Σ-module. Deﬁne the ( σ,Id)-
connection (5.5), on this new left Σ-module (Mat N(C),{(ˆσa,Id)}n
a=1).Since (5.5) is a
left (σ,Id)-connection, it suﬃces to show that it satisﬁes (4.1). Let A,B∈MatN(C),
one has

=A∇Xa(B)+Xa(A)ˆσa(B),
showing that (5.5) is a symmetric left ( σ,τ)-connection on (Mat N(C),{ˆσa,Id}n
a=1). It
is shown in [AI22] that the curvature of this connection satisﬁes th e twisted linearity
condition (5.3). Since the bracket on ( TΣ,R) is zero, i.e., [ Xa,Xb]R= 0 forXa,Xb∈
TΣ,the curvature of any ( σ,τ)-connection on (Mat N(C),{(ˆσa,Id)}n
a=1) is given as
Curv(Xa,Xb) =∇Xa◦∇Xb−∇Xb◦∇Xa.
Explicitly, the curvature of the ( σ,Id)-connection (5.5) is
Curv(Xa,Xb)A=UaUbA[U−1

forA∈MatN(C).We would like to verify that the commutation relations (5.2) is
satisﬁedin this case. Since ˆ τa=τa= Id,the twocommutationrelations[ˆ τa,ˆτb] = 0and
[ˆτa,∇Xb] = 0 are already satisﬁed. One needs to verify [ σa,σb] = 0 and [ σa,Xb] = 0.
LetA∈MatN(C),one has
[σa,σb](A) =σa(σb(A))−σb(σa(A)) =σa(UbAU−1

(using that [ Ua,Ub] = 0) showing that the commutation relations (5.2) are satisﬁed.
Therefore, by Corollary 5.4, we have veriﬁed that the left symmetr ic (σ,Id)-connection
(5.5) deﬁned on the Σ-module (Mat N(C),{(ˆσa,Id)}n
a=1) such that the relations (5.2)
are satisﬁed and the bracket of the ( σ,τ)-Lie algebra ( TΣ,R) satisﬁes (5.1) has curva-

6.Commutative (σ,τ)-algebras
In this Section, we demonstrate that the notion of regular and str ongly regular pairs
on a commutative algebra can be used to construct modules of ( σ,τ)-derivations on
whichcurvatureandtorsionofsomeconnectionscanbecomputed . Notethatwhen Ais
commutative,Der (σ,τ)(A)isanA-moduleanditconsistofsymmetric( σ,τ)-derivations.
For example, on a unique factorisationdomain A,theA-module Der (σ,τ)(A) is free and
of rank one with generatorδ
gwheregis the greatest common divisor of the image of
δ[HLS06]. It is further shown in [HLS06] that every ( σ,τ)-derivation is of the form
X(f) =f0δ(f)
g.Let us recall these results.
Theorem 6.1 ([HLS06]) .LetAbe a unique factorization domain and let σ,τ∈
End(A)such that σ/\e}atio\slash=τ. Then Der(σ,τ)(A)is a free A-module of rank one gener-
ated by
(6.1) ∆ =(τ−σ)
g:x/mapsto−→(τ−σ)(x)
g
whereg=gcd((τ−σ)(A)).
Note that the ( σ,τ)-derivation ∆ in (6.1) is not necessarily an inner ( σ,τ)-derivation
whengis not invertible in A. Now, let us try to understand what happens on a
commutativealgebrathat isnot auniquefactorizationdomain. Let u sstartbyshowing
that in case there is a common divisor, then a ( σ,τ)-derivation has to have a similar
form as in (6.1).
Proposition 6.2. LetXbe a(σ,τ)-derivation on a commutative algebra A.If there
existsg0∈ Asuch that δ(g0)dividesδ(f)X(g0)for allf∈ A,then
X(f) =X(g0)δ(f)
δ(g0).
Proof.SinceXis a symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivation, Lemma 2.7 implies that
X(f)δ(g) =δ(f)X(g)
forf,g∈ A.Now, let g0∈ Abe such that δ(g0) divides X(g0)δ(f) for allf∈ A,one
has
X(f)δ(g0)
δ(g0)=X(g0)δ(f)
δ(g0)⇒X(f) =X(g0)δ(f)
δ(g0),
as required. /square
Theexistenceofacommondivisorisinfactacharacterizationofinne r(σ,τ)-derivations,
as the next result shows.
Corollary 6.3. LetXbe a(σ,τ)-derivation on a commutative algebra A.ThenXis
inner if and only if there exist g0∈ Asuch that δ(g0)dividesX(g0).
Proof.Assume thatthere exist g0∈ Asuchthat δ(g0) divides X(g0),thenδ(g0) divides
X(g0)δ(f) for allf∈ Aand by Proposition 6.2,
X(f) =X(g0)δ(f)
δ(g0).SYMMETRIC ( σ,τ)-ALGEBRAS AND ( σ,τ)-HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY 21
Sinceδ(g0) divides X(g0) letP0be such that X(g0) =P0δ(g0),one has
X(f) =X(g0)δ(f)
δ(g0)=P0δ(g0)δ(f)
δ(g0)=P0δ(f),
showing that Xis inner. Conversely, assume that Xis inner. Then, by deﬁnition, δ(f)
dividesX(f) for allf∈ A.Thus there exist g0∈ Asuch that δ(g0) divides X(g0)./square
Let us look at how Proposition 6.2 applies to ( σ,τ)-derivations on the polynomial
algebraK[x] (which is a unique factorization domain, implying that Theorem 6.1 may
also be applied). Assume that σ(p)(x) =p(qx) andτ(p)(x) =p(x) forp(x)∈K[x] and
q∈R\{0}.One has
δ(p) =τ/parenleftBiggN/summationdisplay
i=0aixi/parenrightBigg
−σ/parenleftBiggN/summationdisplay
i=0aixi/parenrightBigg
=N/summationdisplay
i=1(1−qi)aixi
=N−1/summationdisplay
k=0/parenleftbig
(1+q+···+qk)ak+1xk/parenrightbig
(1−q)x=r(x)(1−q)x,
implying that (1 −q)xis the greatest common divisor of δ(K[x]).From Proposition 6.2,
settingg0=x,one hasδ(x) = (1−q)xand it follows that any ( σ,τ)-derivation Xon
K[x] is of the form
(6.2) X=p(x)δ
(1−q)x
forp(x) =K[x] determined by X(x).From Corollary 6.3 it follows that the derivation
Xabove is inner if an only if p(x) is divisible by x, that is if p(x) has no constant term.
In other words, if p(x) has a constant term, then the derivation Xin (6.2) is an outer
derivation. Furthermore, this implies that the Jackson derivative, deﬁned in (2.3), is
an outer ( σ,τ)-derivation on K[x] sincep(x) = 1 in that case.
Let us now considera commutative algebra A(not necessarilya unique factorization
domain) and let ˆ g∈ Abe a common divisor of δ(A); i.e. ˆgdividesδ(f) for allf∈ A.
For each f∈ A,deﬁne a linear map Xf:A → Aby
Xf(a) =fδ(a)
ˆg
for alla∈ A.One has
Xf(ab) =fδ(ab)
ˆg=fσ(a)δ(b)+δ(a)τ(b)
ˆg=σ(a)fδ(b)
ˆg+fδ(a)
ˆgτ(b)
=σ(a)Xf(b)+Xf(a)τ(b),
showing that Xfis a (σ,τ)-derivation. Since Ais commutative, Xfis symmetric. In
analogy with Theorem 6.1, let us show that if the common divisor actua lly lies in the
image of δand (σ,τ) is a regular pair, then every ( σ,τ)-derivation is of this form.
Proposition 6.4. Let(σ,τ)be a regular pair of endomorphisms on a commutative
algebraA. Ifˆgis a common divisor of Im(δ)such that ˆg∈Im(δ)then Der (σ,τ)(A)is
a free module of rank one with basis δ/ˆg.22 KWALOMBOTA ILWALE
Proof.Letg0∈ Asuch that δ(g0) = ˆg. Lemma 2.7 implies that
X(f)ˆg=δ(f)X(g0)⇒X(f) =X(g0)δ(f)
ˆg
since ˆgisacommondivisoroftheimageof δ,whichshowsthat δ/ˆggeneratesDer (σ,τ)(A).
Now, assuming f0δ(f)/ˆg= 0 for all f∈ Aimplies that f0δ(f) = 0 for all f∈ Awhich
givesf0= 0 since ( σ,τ) is assumed to be a regular pair. Hence, δ/ˆgis a basis for
Der(σ,τ)(A). /square
The setMˆg={fδ
ˆg:f∈ A}is a collection of symmetric ( σ,τ)-derivations of Aand
the pair ( A,Mˆg) is a symmetric ( σ,τ)-algebra. Let Σ ˆg= (A,Mˆg) and let TΣˆgbe the
tangent space generated by Mˆg. It is easy to see that TΣˆg=Mˆgsince
Xf+Xg= (f+g)δ
ˆg=Xf+g.
Moreover, the vector space TΣˆgcan be endowed with an A-module structure by deﬁn-
ing
f·Xg=Xfg
forf,g∈ A.Indeed, if f1,f2∈ AandXg∈TΣˆg,then one has
(f1+f2)·Xg=X(f1+f2)g=Xf1g+f2g=Xf1g+Xf2g=f1·Xg+f2·Xg
and
f1·(f2·Xg) =f1·Xf2g=Xf1(f2g)=X(f1f2)g= (f1f2)·Xg,
as well as
f·(Xg1+Xg2) =f·Xg1+g2=Xfg1+fg2=f·Xg1+f·Xg2.
forg1,g2∈ A.
Thus,TΣˆgis anA-module and it consists of ( σ,τ)-derivations of Aand it is a
submodule of the module of ( σ,τ)-derivations Der (σ,τ)(A). The next result shows that
if (σ,τ) is a regular pair, then δ/ˆgis a basis for TΣˆg.
Proposition 6.5. Let(σ,τ)be a regular pair of endomorphisms on a commutative
algebraAand letΣˆg= (A,Mˆg)whereˆgis a common divisor of δ(A).Thenδ
ˆgis a
basis ofTΣˆg.
Proof.We would like to show that if fδ
ˆg= 0 then f= 0. Since ( σ,τ) is a regular pair,
there exist a0∈ Asuch that δ(a0) is not a zero divisor. Let us ﬁrst show that if δ(a0)
is not a zero divisor thenδ(a0)
ˆgis not a zero divisor. For the sake of argument, assume
thatδ(a0)
ˆgis a zero divisor. Then there exist f0∈ Asuch that f0δ(a0)
ˆg= 0, which
implies
ˆgf0δ(a0)
ˆg= 0⇒f0δ(a0) = 0 (6.3)
contradicting the fact that δ(a0) is not a zero divisor. Henceδ(a0)
ˆgis not a zero divisor.
It follows that
fδ(a)
ˆg= 0,∀a∈ A ⇒ fδ(a0)
ˆg= 0⇒f= 0,SYMMETRIC ( σ,τ)-ALGEBRAS AND ( σ,τ)-HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY 23
showing thatδ
ˆgis indeed a basis for TΣˆg. /square
Next, let us explore the possibility of deﬁning a ( σ,τ)-Lie algebra structure on TΣˆg.
Proposition 6.6. Letσ∈Aut(A)and assume that (σ,Id)is a regular pair of endo-
morphisms. If R:TΣˆg⊗CTΣˆg→TΣˆg⊗CTΣˆgis deﬁned by
R(Xf⊗CXg) =Xσ(g)⊗CXσ−1(f)
forXf,Xg∈TΣˆgthen(TΣˆg,R)is a(σ,τ)-Lie algebra.
Proof.Letm:TΣˆg⊗CTΣˆg→TΣˆgdenote the composition m(Xf⊗CXg) =Xf◦Xg.
Toprovethat( TΣˆg,R) isa(σ,τ)-Lie algebra,oneneedstoshowthat R2= IdTΣˆg⊗CTΣˆg
and
m(Xf⊗CXg−R(Xf⊗CXg))∈TΣˆg. (6.4)
Let us ﬁrst prove that R2= IdTΣˆg⊗CTΣˆg.ForXf,Xg∈TΣˆg,one has
R2(Xf⊗CXg) =R(Xσ(g)⊗CXσ−1(f)) =Xσ(σ−1(f))⊗CXσ−1(σ(g))=Xf⊗CXg.
To prove (6.4), note that
m(Xf⊗CXg)(a) =Xf◦Xg(a) =fX1(gX1(a))
fora∈ A. One has
m(Xf⊗CXg−R(Xf⊗CXg))(a) =Xf◦Xg(a)−Xσ(g)◦Xσ−1(f)(a)
=fX1(gX1(a))−σ(g)X1(σ−1(f)X1(a)) =fσ(g)X1(X1(a))+fX1(g)X1(a)
−σ(g)σ(σ−1(f))X1(X1(a))−σ(g)X1(σ−1(f))X1(a)
=fX1(g)X1(a)−σ(g)X1(σ−1(f))X1(a)
= (Xf(g)−Xσ(g)(σ−1(f)))X1(a) =XXf(g)−Xσ(g)(σ−1(f))(a)
implying that m(Xf⊗CXg−R(Xf⊗CXg))∈TΣˆg.Thus, (TΣˆg,R) is a (σ,τ)-Lie
algebra. /square

forXf,Xg∈TΣˆg.
For arbitrary σ,τ∈End(A),TΣˆgcan be given the structure of a Σ ˆg-module.
Namely, deﬁning ˆ σ,ˆτ:TΣˆg→TΣˆgby
ˆσ(Xf) =Xσ(f)and ˆτ(Xf) =Xτ(f)
one ﬁnds that
ˆσ(fXg) = ˆσ(Xfg) =Xσ(f)σ(g)=σ(f)Xσ(g)=σ(f)ˆσ(Xg)
showing (together with obvious linearity properties and a similar comp utation for ˆ τ)
that(TΣ,{ˆσ,ˆτ})isaΣ ˆg-module. Letusnowstudythecurvatureofaconnectiononthe

=fτ(g)Xδ(h)+fδ(g)Xσ(h)=τ(g)∇Xf(Xh)+Xf(g)ˆσ(Xh)
showing that ∇is a symmetric ( σ,τ)-connection. Moreover, it holds that
∇fXg(Xh) =∇Xfg(Xh) =fgXδ(h)=f∇Xg(Xh)
forf,g,h∈ A. Note that if ( σ,τ) is a stronglyregularpair, then the connection deﬁned
in (6.5) is the unique symmetric ( σ,τ)-connection on TΣˆg(cf. Corollary 4.12). Let us
now compute the curvature of ∇in the setting of Proposition 6.6.
Proposition 6.7. Assume that Σˆg= (A,Mˆg)is a regular (σ,τ)-algebra such that
(TΣˆg,R)is a(σ,Id)-Lie algebra with Rgiven by
R(Xf⊗CXg) =Xσ(g)⊗CXσ−1(f)
forXf,Xg∈TΣˆgand let(M,{(ˆσ,ˆτ)})be a (left) Σˆg-module. If ∇:TΣˆg×M→M
is a left (σ,Id)-connection such that ∇fXg(m) =f∇Xg(m)for allf,g∈ A,then the
curvature of ∇is zero.
Proof.Forf,g∈ Aone computes
Curv(Xf,Xg)(m) =∇Xf(∇Xg(m))−∇Xσ(g)(∇Xσ−1(f)(m))−∇[Xf,Xg]R(m)
=∇Xf(g∇X1(m))−∇Xσ(g)(σ−1(f)∇X1(m))−∇[Xf,Xg]R(m)

−σ(g)X1(σ−1(f))∇X1(m)−∇[Xf,Xg]R(m)
= (fX1(g)−σ(g)X1(σ−1(f)))∇X1(m)−∇[Xf,Xg]R(m)
=∇[Xf,Xg]R(m)−∇[Xf,Xg]R(m) = 0,
showing that the curvature is indeed zero. /square
In particular, Proposition 6.7 implies that the curvature of the ( σ,τ)-connection on
TΣˆggiven in (6.5) is zero.
We remark that not all connections on TΣˆg-module have zero curvature. For exam-
