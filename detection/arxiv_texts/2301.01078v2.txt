Coherent structures are found in many diﬀerent turbulent ﬂo ws and are known to drive self-
sustaining processes in wall turbulence. Identifying the t riadic interactions which generate
coherent structures can provide insights beyond what is pos sible with linearized models.
There are inﬁnite possible interactions that may generate a given structure. Thus, a method
to systematically study those, ranking them in terms of thei r contribution to the structure of
interest, is essential. We here use the resolvent-based ext ended spectral proper orthogonal
decomposition (RESPOD) approach (Karban, U. et al. 2022 Self-similar mechanisms in wall
turbulence studied using resolvent analysis. Journal of Fluid Mechanics 969, A36) to rank the
triadic interactions which give rise to the dominant cohere nt structures in minimal Couette
ﬂows at Reynolds number 400 and 1000. Our analysis identiﬁes that six triadic interactions
dominate the most energetic coherent structure, revealing the capability of the methodology
to identify and rank nonlinear interactions. The approach c an be used to analyse the energy
exchange in turbulent ﬂows and may guide the construction of reduced-order models based
on the interplay between diﬀerent ﬂow modes. Based on this fr amework, we introduce
a modelling strategy where the interactions increasing or r educing the energy of a given
mode are grouped as sources and sinks, respectively. The eﬀe ct of the sinks is embedded in
the resolvent operator by using an eddy viscosity model. The sources are used for driving
this modiﬁed resolvent operator and are shown to yield accur ate ﬂow predictions at zero
frequency. We discuss that this strategy can be useful when a nalysing nonlinear interactions
or modelling forcing at high-Reynolds-number ﬂows.

the near-wall cycle (Hamilton et al. 1995) in wall-bounded ﬂows to noise generation in
jets (Jordan & Colonius 2013; Cavalieri et al. 2019). It has been shown that the linear
mechanisms play a major role in the generation of coherent st ructures (Ellingsen & Palm
1975; Landahl 1980; Robinson 1991; Trefethen et al. 1993; Hwang & Cossu 2010 b; Brandt
2014; Schmidt et al. 2018; Pickering et al. 2020). A now popular approach to investigate
these mechanisms is resolvent analysis, where the Navier-S tokes (N-S) equation are arranged
in input-output form in the frequency domain (Farrell & Ioan nou 1993; Jovanovi ´c & Bamieh
2005; McKeon & Sharma 2010; Hwang & Cossu 2010 a; Sipp & Marquet 2012; Towne et al.
2018; Lesshaﬀt et al. 2019). Although resolvent analysis provides a dynamical fr amework,
in most cases, it provides only a qualitative understanding of the coherent structures and
associated mechanisms. It has been shown for certain ﬂows th at modelling the nonlinear
ﬂuctuations, i.e., the color of the turbulence, is essentia l for better prediction of these
structures (Zare et al. 2017; Martini et al. 2020; Amaral et al. 2021; Morra et al. 2021;
Nogueira et al. 2021; Karban et al. 2022a), particularly when developing ﬂow models that
can quantitatively predict coherent structures.
One way to tackle the nonlinearity is to use eddy viscosity. I t has been shown for many
ﬂows that adopting a frozen, i.e., time-invariant, eddy vis cosity model while constructing
the resolvent operator improves the prediction of coherent structures (Hwang & Cossu
2010b; Morra et al. 2019, 2021; Pickering et al. 2021; Kuhn et al. 2021). Using frozen
eddy viscosity incorporates in to the resolvent operator th e dissipative eﬀects of nonlinear
interactions.
An alternative approach to model the nonlinearity is to use q uasi-linear approximation
(Malkus 1956), where the N-S equations are split into averag ed quantities and the remaining
ﬂuctuating terms. The equations for the averaged quantitie s are then solved directly taking
into account the coupling with the ﬂuctuation equations, wh ile the ﬂuctuation equations are
linearised by neglecting the nonlinear ﬂuctuating terms (M alkus 1956) or replacing them
with a linear model (Farrell & Ioannou 2012; Thomas et al. 2014; Constantinou et al. 2014;
Bretheim et al. 2015; Farrell et al. 2017; Bretheim et al. 2018).
When decomposing the ﬂow into Fourier modes, the quadratic n onlinearity of the
incompressible N-S equations become triadic interactions between these modes. All these
approaches involve modelling the nonlinear terms as a bulk q uantity rather than tracing
separately the triadic interactions of which they are forme d. For a high-Reynolds-number
turbulent ﬂow, the vast number of possible interactions for ming a given nonlinear term
prohibits their direct modelling. There are some studies wh ich analytically investigate triadic
interactions in simple cases such as homogeneous turbulenc e (Kraichnan 1973; Waleﬀe
1992; Moﬀatt 2014). Cheung & Zaki (2014) investigated the an alytical properties of triadic
interactions in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence using t he spectral N-S equations. They
showed that the famous -5/3 decay is embedded in the N-S equat ions. In a recent study,
Choet al. (2018) employed the spectral turbulent kinetic energy equa tion to trace the energy
transfer between diﬀerent scales in a turbulent channel via triadic interactions. Jin et al.
(2021) adopted a similar approach to study the energy transf er in cylinder wake.
Triadic interactions in turbulent ﬂows are also investigat ed within the resolvent framework.
The interactions between the response modes of the resolven t operator and their eﬀect
of the self-similar nature of these modes was ﬁrst discussed in Sharma et al. (2017).
Rosenberg et al. (2019) showed that by including the eﬀect of triadic interac tions among
the dominant response modes of the resolvent operator, pred iction of coherent structures can
be signiﬁcantly improved in oscillatory ﬂows. This approac h was followed by Symon et al.
(2019) where they studied ﬂow over airfoils, and then by Symo net al. (2021), where they
investigated the energy transfer in some minimal ﬂow units. A formalism was provided by
Padovan et al. (2020) to extend the resolvent framework to oscillatory ﬂow s, taking intoModal decomposition of nonlinear interactions in wall turb ulence 3
account the cross-frequency interactions. Rigas et al. (2021) used the resolvent framework
together with limited triadic interactions to investigate boundary layer transition. Bae et al.
(2021) investigated critical nonlinear mechanisms in Pois euille ﬂow, again using resolvent
framework, by ﬁltering the contribution of the dominant for cing mode to response generation.
In this study, we investigate dominant nonlinear mechanism s in wall-bounded turbulence.
The complexity of all possible triadic interactions in a tur bulent ﬂow can be reduced by
focusing on a certain quantity and eliminating all the non-r elevant interactions. We use the
resolvent-based extended spectral proper orthogonal deco mposition (RESPOD) (Towne et al.
2015; Karban et al. 2022a) for this purpose. RESPOD is used to rank the triadic interac tions
in terms of their correlation with and/or their contributio n to a given observable. The method
is implemented using a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of minimal Couette ﬂow with
Reynolds number 400, where the dominant coherent structure s obtained by spectral proper
orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) (Towne et al. 2018) is chosen as the observable. In
similar minimal channel conﬁgurations, Bae et al. (2021) investigated the triadic interactions
contributing to the (/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD)=(0,2/u1D70B//u1D43F/u1D467)mode, where /u1D6FCand/u1D6FDare streamwise and spanwise
wavenumbers, respectively, and /u1D43F/u1D467is the domain size in /u1D467-direction. We investigate here the
triadic interactions systematically extracted using RESP OD for the same mode. By doing so,
we present an approach to investigate nonlinear interactio ns in numerical datasets, where the
eﬀect of each triad on the observable of interest may be studi ed separately using the resolvent
operator. This provides a quantitative analysis of the cont ribution of the various triads at play.
The minimal Couette ﬂow used here leads to a lower number of no n-linear interactions with
a few dominant coherent structures, which simpliﬁes the ana lysis. The available knowledge
of the dynamics of this ﬂow allows us to demonstrate that the t ool we propose does indeed
identify the dominant ﬂow interactions.
We then combine this analysis with the use of eddy viscosity. A static value of eddy
viscosity, as discussed earlier, is used to model the overal l dissipative eﬀect of time-averaged
nonlinear interactions by acting as an energy sink for the en tire ﬂow ﬁeld. This strategy is seen
to be useful for improving the modelling capacity of the reso lvent operator (Pickering et al.
2021; Morra et al. 2021; Symon et al. 2023). However, as it already models the nonlinear
interactions, which show up as the forcing term in the resolv ent framework, it was unclear
so far how to use eddy viscosity to make quantitative predict ions when one has access to the
forcing terms.
As will be seen later in our analysis, not all the nonlinear in teractions extract energy from
a given ﬂow structure. Some interactions increase the energ y of the observed structure by
transferring energy from other scales or being associated w ith ampliﬁcation mechanisms
such as the lift-up mechanism (Robinson 1991; Brandt 2014). Based on this observation, we
propose a modelling strategy where the nonlinear interacti ons are grouped as sources and
sinks, i.e., the interactions that have constructive or des tructive eﬀect on the observed mode,
respectively. A similar notion of source/sink decompositi on was investigated in Kuhn et al.
(2022) based on turbulent kinetic energy budget. We model th e sinks using frozen eddy
viscosity when constructing the resolvent operator and the sources are used to drive this
modiﬁed resolvent operator. Our analysis reveals that such a decomposition of the nonlinear
interactions yield quantitatively accurate representati on of the ﬂow ﬁeld. We also demonstrate
the relevance of this decomposition investigating the Coue tte ﬂow/u1D445/u1D452=1000. The methods
are general and may be employed in other ﬂows of interest. Wit h the approaches developed
here we move beyond the analysis capabilities given by the re solvent operator, by analysing
the non-linear terms at play in turbulence dynamics.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: the math ematical framework to extract
triadic interactions associated with a measured quantity i s explained in §2. The details about
the DNS database of the minimal Couette ﬂow are provided in §3. The results of identifying4 U. Karban et al.
the relevant triadic interactions and the energy transfer v ia these interactions in the minimal
Couette ﬂow are discussed in §4. The analysis to relate the eﬀect of the triadic interaction s
with the use of eddy viscosity is presented in §5. Finally, some concluding remarks are
provided in §6.
2. Extracting nonlinear interactions using RESPOD
We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equati ons in Cartesian coordinates as,
M/u1D715/u1D461/u1D492(/u1D499,/u1D461)=N (/u1D492(/u1D499,/u1D461)), (2.1)
where/u1D492=[/u1D462/u1D463/u1D464 /u1D45D]⊤is the state vector, Ndenotes the nonlinear N-S operator for
incompressible ﬂows and the matrix Mis zero for the continuity equation and identity
matrix for the remaining equations. Discretisation in spac e and Taylor series expansion
around the mean, /u1D492(/u1D499), yields
M/u1D715/u1D461/u1D492′(/u1D499,/u1D461) −A(/u1D499)/u1D492′(/u1D499,/u1D461)=B/u1D487(/u1D499,/u1D461), (2.2)
where A(/u1D499)=/u1D715/u1D45EN|/u1D492is the linear operator obtained from the Jacobian of Nand/u1D487(/u1D499,/u1D461)
denotes all the remaining nonlinear terms, interpreted as a forcing term in the momentum
equations; MdenotesMin discrete form and Bimposes zero forcing at the continuity
equation. Full expressions for the operators are given in No gueira et al. (2021). We focus on
parallel ﬂow, i.e., a ﬂow that is homogeneous in two directio ns, for instance, in /u1D465and/u1D467, with
the mean ﬂow varying only in /u1D466. We can modify ( 2.2) to cast it in the resolvent form by
applying Fourier transforms in all homogeneous dimensions and rearranging as,
ˆ/u1D492(˜/u1D6FC,˜/u1D6FD,/u1D714)=R(˜/u1D6FC,˜/u1D6FD,/u1D714)ˆ/u1D487(˜/u1D6FC,˜/u1D6FD,/u1D714), (2.3)
where ˜/u1D6FCand ˜/u1D6FDare the streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers, respectively , and/u1D714is
the angular frequency, the hat indicates a Fourier transfor med quantity and R(˜/u1D6FC,˜/u1D6FD,/u1D714)/defines
(−/u1D456/u1D714M−A(˜/u1D6FC,˜/u1D6FD))−1Bis the resolvent operator. For brevity, we drop the notation showing
dependence on wavenumber, wall-normal coordinate and freq uency in what follows.
For the incompressible N-S equations, the forcing term in ( 2.2) is given as/u1D487=/u1D496′⊤·
∇/u1D496′−/u1D496′⊤·∇/u1D496′, where(·)and()⊤denote dot product and transpose, respectively, and
the overbar denotes averaging in time and homogeneous direc tions/u1D465and/u1D467. The forcing in
wavenumber-frequency space, ˆ/u1D487/u1D48C, is then obtained via a convolution,
ˆ/u1D487/u1D48C=/summationdisplay.1
/u1D48Aˆ/u1D496⊤
/u1D48A·∇ˆ/u1D496/u1D48C−/u1D48A, (2.4)
where/u1D48A=(˜/u1D6FC/u1D456,˜/u1D6FD/u1D456,/u1D714/u1D456), and/u1D48C=(˜/u1D6FC/u1D458,˜/u1D6FD/u1D458,/u1D714/u1D458)denote wavenumber-frequency combinations,
and summation over /u1D48Aimplies a nested summation over ˜ /u1D6FC/u1D456,˜/u1D6FD/u1D456and/u1D714/u1D456. Here, we consider
that/u1D714is discretised. Note that ( 2.4) is valid assuming that the triplet /u1D48Ccontains at least one
non-zero element, such that the averaged term in /u1D487has no contribution.
The RESPOD method, adapted from extended proper orthogonal decomposition (Bor ´ee
2003; Hoarau et al. 2006), ﬁnds, for a given observable, all structures in a ‘tar get’ event that
are correlated to the SPOD modes of the observable. Here we ch oose the target event to be
the nonlinear interactions, which give rise to the forcing t erms in the resolvent framework, as
in Towne et al. (2015) and Karban et al. (2022 a). The goal is to map the triadic interactions
underpinning the dominant coherent structures of the ﬂow.
The SPOD modes of the ﬂow ﬁeld can be estimated using the ensem ble matrix of
realisations, through the eigendecomposition,
ˆQ/u1D43B

/u1D48C, (2.6)
where ˆQ/u1D48C/defines[ˆ/u1D492/u1D48C(1)ˆ/u1D492/u1D48C(2)···ˆ/u1D492/u1D48C(/u1D443)]denotes the ensemble matrix for diﬀerent realisations
of ˆ/u1D492/u1D48Cwith/u1D443being the total number of realisations, /u1D733/u1D48Cand/u1D726/u1D48Care SPOD modes and their
associated eigenvalues, respectively (see Towne et al. (2018)), and Wis a positive-deﬁnite
matrix of quadrature gains along /u1D466, which is discretised. The SPOD modes in the columns
of/u1D733/u1D48Care the optimal orthonormal basis for the realisations of th e observable ˆ/u1D49A/u1D48C.
In Karban et al. (2022 a), it was shown that the coeﬃcient matrix ˆ/u1D723/u1D48Ccan be used to extract
the part in the forcing that is correlated with the observed S POD mode as
X/u1D48C=ˆF/u1D48Cˆ/u1D723/u1D48C/u1D726−1/2
/u1D48C, (2.7)
where, ˆF/u1D48Cis the ensemble matrix of ˆ/u1D487/u1D48C. The RESPOD forcing mode X/u1D48Csatisﬁes
/u1D733/u1D48C=R/u1D48CX/u1D48C, (2.8)
i.e., the RESPOD forcing mode excites precisely the SPOD mod e via the resolvent operator.
As discussed in Karban et al. (2022 a) and Karban et al. (2023), the RESPOD mode includes
the part of the forcing that is correlated to the SPOD mode of i nterest.
Substituting into ( 2.7) the expansion in ( 2.4), which shows the triadic interactions summing
up to yield the forcing ˆF/u1D48C, one can compute the triadic interactions correlated with t he
observable as

In this study, we focus on the optimal SPOD mode, i.e., the col umn in/u1D733/u1D48Ccorresponding
the largest eigenvalue, and the associated forcing mode, de ﬁned as/u1D74D/u1D48Cand/u1D74C/u1D48C, respectively.
Following the notation in ( 2.11), individual triadic interactions, which yield /u1D74C/u1D48Cwhen summed
over/u1D48Aare denoted with /u1D74C/u1D48A,/u1D48C−/u1D48A. Similarly, the response to a single triadic interaction is denoted
as/u1D74D/u1D48A,/u1D48C−/u1D48A=R/u1D48C/u1D74C/u1D48A,/u1D48C−/u1D48A, which also implies that summation of /u1D74D/u1D48A,/u1D48C−/u1D48Aover/u1D48Aresults in/u1D74D/u1D48C.
We deﬁne the energy as,
/ba∇dbl(·)/ba∇dbl2=/u1D700{(·)/u1D43BW(·)}, (2.12)
where the superscript /u1D43Bindicates Hermitian transpose, and /u1D700{·}denotes the expectation
operator. In what follows, /u1D700{·}corresponds to time-averaging for time-dependent structu res,
and to ensemble averaging for Fourier realisations in the fr equency space. The energy of
/u1D74C/u1D48A,/u1D48C−/u1D48A, denoted by /ba∇dbl/u1D74C/u1D48A,/u1D48C−/u1D48A/ba∇dbl2, for all/u1D48Ashows the correlation map of the nonlinear interactions
related to the observed SPOD mode, /u1D74D/u1D48C. One can instead investigate /ba∇dbl/u1D74D/u1D48A,/u1D48C−/u1D48A/ba∇dbl2, which
provides the contribution of a triadic interaction to the op timal SPOD mode of the observed
state, as suggested by ( 2.8) and ( 2.11). By removing or including terms in the sum in equation
(2.11), one is able to inspect the contributions of each triad /u1D48Ato the observable.6 U. Karban et al.

3. Database of the minimal Couette ﬂow
The use of RESPOD for detection of ‘important’ nonlinear int eractions associated with
a speciﬁc measurement is tested on a minimal Couette ﬂow (Ham iltonet al. 1995), sim-
ilar to that investigated by Nogueira et al. (2021). The simulations are performed using
the ‘ChannelFlow’ code, a pseudo-spectral incompressible ﬂow solver using a Fourier-
Chebyshev discretisation in the wall-parallel and wall-no rmal directions, respectively (see
www.channelﬂow.ch for details). The dimensions of the mini mal box are (/u1D43F/u1D465,/u1D43F/u1D466,/u1D43F/u1D467)=
(1.75/u1D70Bℎ,2ℎ,1.2/u1D70Bℎ), where the subscripts /u1D465,/u1D466and/u1D467denote the streamwise, wall-normal and
spanwise directions, and ℎis the channel half-height. These are the minimal dimension s to
sustain turbulence in Couette ﬂow at low Reynolds number, as studied by Hamilton et al.
(1995). For simpler notation, wavenumbers will be presente d in integers deﬁned as /u1D6FC=
˜/u1D6FC/u1D43F/u1D465/2/u1D70Band/u1D6FD=˜/u1D6FD/u1D43F/u1D467/2/u1D70B.
The domain was discretised as (/u1D45B/u1D465,/u1D45B/u1D466,/u1D45B/u1D467)=(32,65,32)with a dealiasing factor of 3/2
in the wall-parallel directions. The channel walls move wit h wall velocity, ±/u1D448/u1D464yielding
a Reynolds number, /u1D445/u1D452=400 based on /u1D448/u1D464andℎ, corresponding to a friction Reynolds
number,/u1D445/u1D452/u1D70F≈34. Once the initial transients disappeared, the ﬂow data wa s stored for
7000 convective units with a sampling rate, Δ/u1D461=0.25. Temporal data is transformed into
frequency space using blocks of 2048 time steps with 50% over lapping and using a second-
order exponential windowing function given in Martini et al. (2019). While computing the
forcing data, the correction due to using windowing functio ns is implemented as described
in Martini et al. (2019) and Nogueira et al. (2021). We veriﬁed that the forcing acting on the
resolvent operator accurately yields the response, howeve r, the comparison is not shown here
for brevity.
Figure 1presents the proﬁles for the mean and the root-mean-square ( RMS) of the velocity
components, /u1D462,/u1D463and/u1D464in the streamwise, wall-normal and spanwise directions, re spectively,
along the wall-normal direction, /u1D466. We see that the mean ﬂow deviates from the laminar
solution given by (/u1D466−1)due to nonlinear interactions between turbulent ﬂuctuatio ns. The
RMS plots indicate that the ﬂuctuations in /u1D462peak around /u1D466=1.5 and/u1D466=0.5. A similar but
smaller double-peak structure is seen in the RMS of /u1D464with the peaks occurring at the same
wall-normal positions. The RMS of /u1D463peaks around the centre at an amplitude slightly lower
than that of /u1D464.Modal decomposition of nonlinear interactions in wall turb ulence 7

diﬀerent wavenumber pairs. The color-scale ranges two orde rs of magnitude for both plots.
Minimal Couette ﬂow is known to be dominated most of the time b y rolls and streaks
spanning the entire computational domain, corresponding t o(/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD)=(0,1). Occasionally
wavy disturbanceswith /u1D6FC=1 appear after streak instability and breakdown, and subseq uently
non-linear interactions among such “waves” lead to the form ation of new rolls, restarting
the process (Hamilton et al. 1995; Hall & Sherwin 2010). Figure 2shows the time-averaged
energy contained in each wavenumber pair and the associated forcing. We see that the mode
pair(/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD)=(0,1), related to streaks and rolls, contains most of the ﬂuctuati on energy
(∼75%). In contrast, the modes (±1,0), related to waves, and (0,2), which we will refer to as
roll-streak harmonic, contain slightly less than 5% of the t otal energy, and all the other mode
pairs have less than 2%. The energy among the forcing modes is more evenly distributed.
The dominant modes are (±1,1), each containing ∼13% of the total forcing energy.
Figure 3shows the power spectral density (PSD), integrated along th e wall-normal
direction, of the velocity ﬁeld /u1D492at wavenumber pairs (/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD)=(0,1),(0,2),(1,0)and
(1,1). Although the oblique-wave mode (/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD)=(1,1)is energy-wise insigniﬁcant, it plays
a critical role for transfer of energy to (/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD)=(0,1)mode, as will be shown later, and hence
is included here. We see that the streamwise-constant modes peak around the zero frequency,
which is expected due to their quasi-steady nature, while th e wave modes (1,0)and(1,1)
have their peak around /u1D714≈0.1, leading to a phase speed of /u1D450+/defines/u1D714+/˜/u1D6FC+=±1 in wall units
(negative values arise if frequency or wavenumber is negati ve) corresponding to ∼10% of
wall velocity. The shape of the spectra is observed to be simi lar for the modes that have the
same streamwise wavenumber. This trend can be more clearly s een in ﬁgure 4, where the
integrated PSDs normalised with respect to the peak value ar e plotted for diﬀerent modes.
We see two diﬀerent families of PSD distributions for the two streamwise wavenumbers,
/u1D6FC=0 and/u1D6FC=1, respectively.
We now focus on the most energetic mode (/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD)=(0,1)at its peak-energy frequency,
/u1D714=0. The optimal response mode and the associated forcing, /u1D74D/u1D48Cand/u1D74C/u1D48C, respectively, are
shown in ﬁgure 5. The optimal response consists of streaks and rolls. Given t hat the upper
and lower walls have positive and negative mean velocities, respectively, the phase relation
between streaks and rolls is reminiscent of the lift-up mech anism (Brandt 2014). This is
further supported regarding the associated forcing mode. A t the spanwise positions where
the streamwise vortices are located, the forcing is mainly l ocated near the walls aligned with
the/u1D467-direction and with the /u1D466-direction to the left and right of the vortices, causing a mo ment8 U. Karban et al.

to generate the streamwise vortices. These vortices then ge nerate streaks by carrying the
high- and low-velocity structures near the upper and lower w alls, respectively, towards the
channel centre. Note that the forcing component in the strea mwise direction is in opposite
phase to the streaks seen in the response. This indicates tha t the streaks are generated by the
lift-up mechanism despite the counteracting eﬀect of the st reamwise forcing, as previously
reported by Nogueira et al. (2021). The response generation at this triplet can therefo re be
considered suboptimal.
We also plot the optimal response ﬁelds for the modes (/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD,/u1D714)=(0,2,0),(1,0,0.1)and

the direct triadic interactions, the interactions correla ted with the optimal SPOD mode,
and the response to the latter obtained by driving the resolv ent operator. Note that only
the triplet/u1D48A=(/u1D6FC/u1D456,/u1D6FD/u1D456,/u1D714/u1D456)is shown, where for each /u1D48A, there exists a /u1D48C−/u1D48Asuch that the
nonlinear interaction between /u1D48Aand/u1D48C−/u1D48Ayields/u1D48C=(0,1,0). Starting with /u1D714/u1D456=0, we
see that the interaction between the roll-streak mode, /u1D48A=(0,−1,0)and its complementary,
roll-streak harmonic /u1D48C−/u1D48A=(0,2,0), is dominant in all three maps, indicating that the
interaction is large in amplitude, highly correlated to the dominant mode, and generates the
response with the largest amplitude. We also observe large a mplitude for the interaction
(0,2,0) + (0,−1,0), which involves the same structures with the previous one, b ut with
the gradient operator acting on the roll-streak mode (0,−1,0). The interactions involving

amplitudes at the ﬁrst two rows of ﬁgure 7), are seen to be present in the response map (third
row of ﬁgure 7), implying that these modes eﬃciently drive the observable . For non-zero
frequencies /u1D714/u1D456=0.05 and 0.1, we observe that the contribution of streamwise-c onstant
modes with /u1D6FC/u1D456=0 decreases with increasing /u1D714, whereas wave modes with /u1D6FC/u1D456=1 drive
an increasingly stronger response for higher frequencies, which may be attributed to the
diﬀerent frequency content of streamwise-constant and wav y modes, explored in ﬁgures 3
and4.
To investigate the overall contribution to the dominant mod e(0,1,0)via a given wavenum-
ber pair denoted by /u1D48A=(/u1D6FC/u1D456,/u1D6FD/u1D456)and its complementary /u1D48C−/u1D48A, we deﬁne the forcing mode

maps shown in ﬁgure 7, the map of /ba∇dbl/u1D74D/u1D48A,/u1D48C−/u1D48A/ba∇dblis plotted in ﬁgure 8-a, which shows that the
response generation is dominated by six interactions: two s treamwise-constant, which are
(0,{−1,2})+(0,{2,−1})involving the roll-streak and roll-streak harmonic modes, and four
streamwise-periodic over /u1D43F/u1D465, which are (±1,{0,1}) + (∓ 1,{1,0})involving wave modes.

roll-streak mode, (/u1D6FC/u1D458,/u1D6FD/u1D458,/u1D714/u1D458)=(0,1,0).
Note that here and in what follows, we use curly brackets for s hort hand notation of multiple
modes. For instance, (0,{−1,2})denotes the modes (0,−1)and(0,2).
Besides the magnitude of the response to a given triadic inte raction, it is important to
evaluate how it contributes to the overall response. As show n in Nogueira et al. (2021)
and Morra et al. (2021), diﬀerent forcing components can interfere destruc tively. In what
follows we propose a measure to identify which interactions are constructive, amplifying
a given mode, or destructive, saturating or damping it. As a m easure of constructive-
ness/destructiveness of a given interaction, we calculate the inner product between the
response to a triadic interaction, /u1D74D/u1D48A,/u1D48C−/u1D48A, and the optimal SPOD mode, /u1D74D/u1D48C,

whereℜ(·) denotes taking the real part. An interaction map is obtained by calculating ( 4.2)
for each wavenumber pair and normalising the result with /ba∇dblˆ/u1D74D/u1D48C/ba∇dbl2, which shows a normalised
projection, and thus the constructive/destructive role of each triadic interaction in generating
the response. The resulting map is shown in ﬁgure 8-b. Note that the interaction map should
sum up to 1, i.e., the sum of all destructive and constructive interactions lead to the mode
observed in the system. This can be shown via the following id entity;

The sum of individual contributions being 1 implies that onl y the real part of the inner
product shown in ( 4.2) can contribute to the mode /u1D74D/u1D48Con average, thus, a real operator is
used in the deﬁnition of the inner product.
The analysis reveals that the contributions from the intera ctions(0,{−1,2})+(0,{2,−1})
decrease the response energy, implying a destructive inter ference between these interactions
and the remaining ones. The interactions involving wave mod es(±1,{0,1}) + (∓ 1,{1,0}),
on the other hand, cause the response energy to increase, imp lying a constructive eﬀect.
The eﬀect of these interactions on the response ﬁeld is shown in ﬁgure 9by masking
these interactions, i.e., subtracting the contributions f rom the designated interactions from
the overall response computed by the resolvent. We see that m asking the interactions12 U. Karban et al.

(0,{−1,2}) + ( 0,{2,−1})mainly aﬀects the streaks causing an increase in their ampli tude,
while the roll remains nearly unchanged. Masking the intera ctions(±1,{0,1})+(∓ 1,{1,0})
almost completely eliminates the streamwise vortices, whi ch also causes the lift-up eﬀect
to be eliminated. This results in streaks with smaller ampli tude and reversed phase. This
result is consistent with models of self-sustaining proces s in wall turbulence, where rolls
are excited by non-linear interactions involving waves wit h non-zero /u1D6FC(Hamilton et al.
1995; Hall & Sherwin 2010). Remember that in the RESPOD forci ng mode shown in ﬁgure
5, the streamwise component counteracts the lift-up mechani sm forced by the spanwise
components. These results, when combined, imply that the st reamwise and spanwise
components in the RESPOD forcing mode, /u1D74C/u1D48C, are mainly constructed by the nonlinear
interaction groups (0,{−1,2}) + ( 0,{2,−1})and(±1,{0,1}) + (∓ 1,{1,0}), respectively.
Masking (±1,{0,1}) + (∓ 1,{1,0})causes the lift-up mechanism, which is an eﬃcient
means to generate streaks via streamwise vortices, to disap pear. The remaining streamwise
component in/u1D74C/u1D48Cis mainly constructed by (0,{−1,2}) + ( 0,{2,−1})and generates streaks

This elucidates the destructive interference among compon ents observed by Nogueira et al.
(2021). The present results show that such destructive inte rference occurs among diﬀerent
triadic interactions. Masking all six modes almost entirel y eliminates the response as seen in

4.2.Energy transfer via triadic interactions
The interaction map shown in ﬁgure 8-b can also be interpreted in terms of energy exchange
between diﬀerent modes via nonlinear interactions. Symon et al. (2021) investigated, by
employing the spectral form of the transport equation of tur bulent kinetic energy (TKE),
the overall relation between production, dissipation and t he transfer of energy for individual
wavenumber pairs in parallel, stationary turbulent ﬂows. T he spectral TKE equation is given,
using indicial notation for the last two terms for convenien ce, as

to zero for a given wavenumber pair. One can write ( 4.4) in the frequency domain by Fourier

The contributions of production, dissipation and nonlinea r transfer to the energy balance
for diﬀerent wavenumber pairs at zero frequency are illustr ated in ﬁgure 10. We see that the
roll-streak mode (0,1) draws the most energy from the mean ﬂo w to produce TKE, and is
the only mode to transfer this energy to other modes via nonli near transfer. All the modes
are seen to lose energy via dissipation as expected. Note tha t the energy balance map is
symmetric in the /u1D6FD/u1D456axis, which is not shown for better readability of the plot.
Choet al. (2018) computed the nonlinear energy transfer via each tria dic interaction by
expanding the convolution in the third term on the right-han d side of ( 4.4) as in ( 2.4). Here,
we do a similar analysis for the nonlinear transfer term in th e frequency-domain energy
balance equation given in ( 4.6). The resulting energy transfer map for (0,1,0) mode is show n
in ﬁgure 11-a, where blue and red colors indicate losing and gaining ene rgy, respectively, via
the corresponding interaction. We see that roll-streak mod e (0,1,0) mostly transfer energy via
the interactions (0,{−1,1},/u1D714)+(0,{2,0},−/u1D714)and(±1,0,/u1D714)+(∓ 1,1,−/u1D714)with(0,−1,/u1D714)+
(0,2,−/u1D714)being the dominant one. It is also seen to gain energy via a num ber of interactions
but the incoming energy rate is negligible compared to outgo ing rate, and hence, is not
discussed here. For the triadic interaction (0,−1,/u1D714) + (0,2,−/u1D714), we calculated that the
transfer from the interaction (0,−1,0) + (0,2,0)is -0.06, which constitutes half of the
transfer from all the frequencies. Since the ﬂow is symmetri c in the spanwise direction,
the modes (0,1,0)and(0,−1,0)are complex conjugates of each other. Thus, we can say
that the mode (0,1,0) is transferring energy to roll-streak harmonic mode (0,2,0) via a triadic
interaction involving its conjugate mode, making the (/u1D6FC/u1D458,/u1D6FD/u1D458)=(0,2)mode the second-most14 U. Karban et al.

energetic with a peak at zero frequency (see ﬁgure 3). This sort of transfer can be associated
to the energy cascade in turbulence from large to small scale s observed in high- /u1D445/u1D452ﬂows.
Combining the results obtained inspecting the energy trans fer and the ﬁndings of the
previous subsection indicate that the mode (0,1,0) gains al most all of its energy from the
mean ﬂow via the lift-up mechanism and transfers some of this energy via nonlinear transfer
to streamwise-constant modes as the onset of energy cascade . This nonlinear transfer appears
as a streak with opposite phase (see bottom left plot in ﬁgure 9). This will be further discussed
below. The response seen in (0,1,0) mode is a result of the des tructive relation between the
lift-up mechanism, excited by the wave modes, and the nonlin ear transfer associated to
roll-streak modes.
We have seen that (0,2,0) mode receives its energy via a nonli near transfer mechanismModal decomposition of nonlinear interactions in wall turb ulence 15

according to the energy budget plot given in ﬁgure 10. The nonlinear transfer via each
triadic interaction contributing to (0,2,0) mode is shown i n ﬁgure 11-b. The map reveals
that (0,2,0) mode receives energy via the interactions (0,1,/u1D714) + (0,1,−/u1D714)at a rate similar
to the energy transfer in (0,1,0) mode via the interactions (0,−1,/u1D714) + (0,2,−/u1D714). Some of
the energy that (0,2,0) mode receives is transferred to the n ext harmonic via the interaction
(0,−1,/u1D714) + (0,3,/u1D714). Looking at the nonlinear transfer map for (0,3,0) mode in ﬁg ure11-c,
we see that energy is transferred via the interaction (0,1,0) + (0,2,0), once again, at a rate
similar to the transfer from (0,2,0) shown in ﬁgure 11-b. One can trace the energy cascade
for the negative /u1D6FDmodes in the same way, which yields the same transfer maps mir rored in
the/u1D6FC/u1D456and/u1D6FD/u1D456axes. This suggests that the modes (/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD)=(0,±1), once extracting energy
from the mean and transferring it to harmonics (0,±2), plays a role to transfer energy via
the triadic interactions associated to higher /u1D6FD, i.e., they provide a medium for the nonlinear
transfer to higher /u1D6FDmodes without losing noticeable energy.
We now investigate whether a destructive relation takes pla ce between the nonlinear
transfer and the lift-up mechanism for roll-streak harmoni c mode(0,2,0)as in roll-streak
mode(0,1,0). In ﬁgure 12, we show the same interaction map given in ﬁgure 8-b for the
mode(/u1D6FC/u1D458,/u1D6FD/u1D458,/u1D714/u1D458)=(0,2,0)together with the reconstruction of the mode in the /u1D466-/u1D467plane.
Similar to the (0,1,0)mode, we see streamwise vortices and streaks in (0,2,0)with a
halved period in the spanwise direction. The rolls and the st reaks are in opposite phase
compared to the (0,1,0), which implies that they are not directly associated with th e lift-
up mechanism. The interaction map indicates strong contrib ution to response generation
from the interactions. Besides these interactions, we see s ome positive contributions from
the interactions (±1,2) + (∓ 1,0). To see the eﬀect of these interactions on the response,
we mask these interactions and observe the change in the resp onse in ﬁgure 13. Masking
the interactions associated to nonlinear transfer, we obta in a response ﬁeld reminiscent of
the lift-up mechanism. This partial response is due to the in teractions (±1,2) + (∓ 1,0).
Masking these interactions, on the other hand, yields a resp onse ﬁeld with inverted streaks
and vortices. Similar to the case of (0,1,0)mode, there exists a destructive interference
between the nonlinear energy transfer and the lift-up mecha nism. Masking both groups of
interactions causes the response to be almost zero, indicat ing that these six interactions are
the active ones for response generation.16 U. Karban et al.

Our analysis so far reveals that diﬀerent nonlinear interac tions can have constructive or
destructive eﬀects on a given ﬂow structure as seen in the int eraction maps given in ﬁgures
8-b and 12. Guided by these results, we now investigate how to combine e ddy viscosity with
the resolvent framework when forcing data is involved.
For a given observed mode, we separate the triadic interacti ons into sources and sinks,
depending on whether they have a constructive or destructiv e eﬀect on the mode, respectively.
We then model the sinks using eddy viscosity when constructi ng the resolvent operator
and use the sources to drive this modiﬁed resolvent operator . The equation describing this
procedure reads
/u1D74D/u1D48C≈˜R/u1D48C/u1D74C+
/u1D48C, (5.1)
where ˜R/u1D48Cdenotes the resolvent operator constructed using eddy visc osity and/u1D74C+
/u1D48Cdenotes
the RESPOD forcing mode constructed using only the interact ions with a positive impact on
/u1D74D/u1D48C, i.e., the interactions depicted with a red square in ﬁgure 8-b. Note that this equation is
not exact, unlike ( 2.8). This suggests that a successful prediction of the ﬂow ﬁeld using ( 5.1)
indicates that the source/sink decomposition proposed her e points to a physical mechanism
about how nonlinear interactions saturate the turbulent ﬂu ctuations.
In ﬁgure 14, we show the source-sink decomposition of the RESPOD forcin g mode for
/u1D48C=(0,1,0)(see ﬁgure 5-b). We see that the streamwise vortex seen in ﬁgure 5-a is generatedModal decomposition of nonlinear interactions in wall turb ulence 17

by the/u1D466- and/u1D467-components of the source, /u1D74C+
/u1D48C. The sink, on the other hand, contains mostly a
streamwise component which has its peak towards the wall and is in opposite phase with the
streak in 5-a. This suggests that the source is associated with the lift -up mechanism, creating
a roll-streak structure, whose energy is dissipated to some extent by the /u1D465-component of the
sink.
We investigate the use of eddy viscosity to model the eﬀect of the sink. The eddy viscosity,
/u1D708/u1D461, is obtained using the Cess model (Cess 1958) given as
/u1D708/u1D461

where/u1D708denotes the molecular viscosity, the von K ´arman constant /u1D705=0.426 and the constant

the molecular viscosity in R/u1D48Cis replaced by /u1D708/u1D461. Note that /u1D708/u1D461is dependent on /u1D466which should
be accounted for when diﬀerentiating the viscosity terms in R/u1D48C(see Hwang & Cossu 2010 a).
In ﬁgure 15, the analysis is tested for (0,1,0)mode, which is the dominant wavenumber-
frequency triplet. The ﬂow ﬁeld obtained using ( 5.1) is compared against the optimal SPOD
mode of the response /u1D74D/u1D48Cas well as the response ﬁelds generated by R/u1D48C/u1D74C+
/u1D48Cand˜R/u1D48C/u1D74C/u1D48C.
As expected, masking the sinks from the forcing causes an ove rprediction of the response
in the case of R/u1D48C/u1D74C+
/u1D48C. On the other hand, using the RESPOD forcing mode without any
decomposition to drive the modiﬁed resolvent operator ( ˜R/u1D48C/u1D74C/u1D48C) leads to underprediction
of the response due to the enhanced damping in ˜R/u1D48C. To quantify the accuracy of each
prediction, the norms for the streak ( /u1D462) and the streamwise vorticity ( [/u1D463 /u1D464]⊤) components of
the predicted response are also compared against those for t he optimal SPOD mode. We see
that removing the sinks and using eddy viscosity with full fo rcing mostly aﬀect the streaks,
doubling and halving its norm, respectively. When ( 5.1) is used instead, these two eﬀects,
i.e., the ampliﬁcation due to the use of sources only and the e nhanced damping due to the
use of eddy viscosity, almost perfectly cancel each other, l eading to an accurate response
prediction.
5.2.Couette ﬂow at /u1D445/u1D452=1000
We now consider the Couette ﬂow at /u1D445/u1D452=1000. The energy distribution per wavenumber
pair and the associated forcing is shown in ﬁgure 16. Once again, the dominant mode is seen
to be(/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD)=(0,1)while the energy of the modes with higher wavenumbers are see n to
be larger compared to the /u1D445/u1D452=400 case, which is expected due to the enhanced turbulence
activity and energy transfer to smaller scales due to the inc rease of/u1D445/u1D452. The energy of the
forcing is more evenly distributed towards smaller scales w ith its peak at the (1,±1)mode
pair.18 U. Karban et al.

decomposed into (a) sink, /u1D74C−
/u1D48C, and (b) source, /u1D74C+
/u1D48C.
We test the source-sink decomposition approach at (/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD,/u1D714)=(0,1,0), which is the
dominant mode similar to the /u1D445/u1D452=400 case. The optimal SPOD mode, /u1D74D/u1D48C, and the
associated RESPOD forcing mode, /u1D74C/u1D48C, are given in ﬁgure 17. Once again, we see a roll-
streak mode in /u1D74D/u1D48Creminiscent of the lift-up mechanism. The associated forci ng, whose
/u1D465-component is in opposite phase of the streak and the /u1D466- and/u1D467- components are mostly
aligned with the streamwise vortex, is decomposed into a sou rce and a sink as shown in
ﬁgure 18. Similar to the /u1D445/u1D452=400 case, we observe that the /u1D466- and/u1D467-components of the
source generates the streamwise vortex, while the /u1D465-component of the sink is responsible for
reducing the streak energy.
We again test modelling the eﬀect of the sink via eddy viscosi ty. For the /u1D445/u1D452=1000
ﬂow, the sensitivity to any imbalance between the sources an d the sinks is signiﬁcantly
higher due to the stronger linear ampliﬁcation mechanisms a ssociated with higher /u1D445/u1D452. This
is clearly observed in ﬁgure 19-b and 19-e where omitting the sinks when driving the original
resolvent operator, R/u1D48C, yields a strong overprediction of the response ( ∼7 folds the SPOD
norm), which is much more evident compared to the /u1D445/u1D452=400 case ( ∼2 folds). Driving the
modiﬁed resolvent operator, ˜R/u1D48C, with sources and sinks together causes an underprediction
of the response due to the enhanced viscous damping as seen in ﬁgure 19-d, halving the norm.
Note that given the diﬀerence in the over- and underpredicti on ratios in ﬁgure 19-e for cases
shown in -b and -d, one can conclude that inclusion of eddy vis cosity improves the robustness
of the resolvent-based prediction by reducing the operator sensitivity to imbalance between
the sources and sinks. Once again, we see that these two eﬀect s cancel each other leading to
the closest prediction of the response as seen in ﬁgure 19-c with a 30% underprediction of
the norm.
Finally, we show the results of source-sink decomposition i n ﬁgures 20and21for(0,2,0)
and(1,0,0)modes, which are the second and third most dominant modes, re spectively. Only
the spanwise component is shown for the (1,0,0)mode since the other two components20 U. Karban et al.
Figure 19: Same as ﬁgure 15; demonstrating the /u1D445/u1D452=1000 case.
tend to zero. Similar to the results for (0,1,0)mode, leaving out the sinks or adding eddy
viscosity results in over- and underprediction of the respo nse, respectively, while the eﬀect
of these two modiﬁcations are mostly neutralised when appli ed at the same time.
5.3.Discussion on the usefulness of source-sink decomposition
This analysis elucidates how eddy viscosity modelling can b e integrated into resolvent
analysis in the presence of forcing data to make quantitativ e predictions. When forcing data
is present, the use of eddy viscosity to predict the ﬂow may se em redundant. However, it may
actually be an interesting approach due to several reasons.
Generating forcing data accurate enough to satisfy ( 2.6) with minimal errors for high- /u1D445/u1D452
turbulent ﬂows is a diﬃcult task, as we discussed in detail in an earlier study (Karban et al.
2022b). Modelling some of the nonlinear interactions with eddy vi scosity can signiﬁcantly
enhance the robustness of the use of resolvent framework wit h forcing data.
Besides, this framework is also advantageous for modelling purposes. In Karban et al.
(2022 a), we showed that the self-similarity of turbulent structur es, which is based on
Townsend’s attached eddy hypothesis (Townsend 1951, 1976) , extends to the forcing terms,
implying self-similar turbulence generation mechanisms. This suggests that it may be possible
to devise self-similar forcing models for high- /u1D445/u1D452ﬂows. However, using such models to drive
the resolvent operator to make quantitative response predi ctions is a hard task due to the
sensitivity of the resolvent operator to any inaccuracy in t he forcing model. The framework
we present here helps overcome this issue in two ways: (i) one only needs to model the
sources as the sinks are modelled via eddy viscosity, and (ii ) the enhanced damping in the
modiﬁed resolvent operator allows more tolerance to errors in the forcing model. Therefore,Modal decomposition of nonlinear interactions in wall turb ulence 21

/u1D48C=(/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD,/u1D714)=(1,0,0).
we believe that this framework opens signiﬁcant room for fut ure progress in quantitative ﬂow
modelling using the resolvent framework.
6. Conclusions
We have discussed a method to investigate the triadic intera ctions that underpin the generation
of ﬂow structures associated with a given observable. The me thod is based on the resolvent-
based extended spectral proper orthogonal decomposition ( RESPOD), used in Karban et al.22 U. Karban et al.
(2022 a) to identify self-similar structures in a turbulent channe l ﬂow. A minimal Couette
ﬂow is here chosen as the test case, where the triadic interac tions associated with optimal
SPOD modes are investigated.
We identify the forcing modes correlated to the SPOD modes of an observable via
RESPOD. These forcing modes generates the associated SPOD m odes when applied to
the resolvent operator. We show in this study that using RESP OD, it is also possible to
identify individual triadic interactions that are correla ted to the observable. Summation of
the correlated triadic interactions is by deﬁnition equal t o the RESPOD forcing mode. This
procedure allows identifying interactions that dominate g enerating the observable.
Our analysis reveals that the most energetic mode, (/u1D6FC,/u1D6FD)=(0,1), at its peak-energy
frequency, /u1D714=0, is mainly driven by six triadic interactions: four intera ctions involving
modes periodic over /u1D43F/u1D465in the streamwise direction, that generate small-in-ampli tude but
eﬃcient forcing, and two interactions involving streamwis e-constant modes that, although
being less eﬃcient, generate forcing structures with large amplitudes. The streamwise-
periodic interactions generate a combined streak-streamw ise vortex structure via the lift-up
mechanism, while the streamwise-constant interactions co unteract the streak generation by
generating a streamwise forcing component in phase opposit ion to the lift-up mechanism. This
explains in physical terms the destructive interference of forcing observed by Nogueira et al.
(2021): forcing is composed of diﬀerent triadic interactio ns with opposing eﬀects in exciting
streamwise vortices and streaks.
Our framework also allows us to investigate energy transfer between diﬀerent modes via
triadic interactions. We observe that the triadic interact ions involving the (0,1)mode provide
a constructive contribution to all the modes investigated. This is an expected result since it
is the only mode with a negative nonlinear transfer rate of tu rbulent kinetic energy, as shown
by the energy balance analysis we conducted following Symon et al. (2021). Investigating
the nonlinear transfer for diﬀerent modes via a range of tria dic interactions, we observe the
energy cascade mechanism transferring energy from (0,1)to(0,2)and then from (0,2)to
(0,3). Comparing the analyses based on the resolvent framework an d energy budget revealed
that the triadic interactions associated to the lift-up mec hanism and the nonlinear transfer are
in destructive interference for the modes (0,1,0)and(0,2,0).
To demonstrate how the resolvent-based framework we develo ped here is associated with
eddy viscosity modelling, we introduced a combined modelli ng strategy: we group the
nonlinear interactions as sources and sinks, then, model th e sinks using eddy viscosity
when constructing the resolvent operator, and drive this mo diﬁed resolvent operator with
the sources only. Our tests in the Couette ﬂow at /u1D445/u1D452=400 and 1000 revealed that such a
decomposition, despite being ad-hoc, yields an accurate re sponse prediction. This elucidates
how to incorporate eddy viscosity modelling into the resolv ent framework in the presence of
forcing data.
Finally, we discussed that such a modelling framework could be beneﬁcial for using
resolvent analysis to make quantitative predictions for hi gh-/u1D445/u1D452turbulent ﬂows. The modiﬁed
resolvent operator oﬀers enhanced damping thanks to the use of eddy viscosity, which reduces
its sensitivity to errors in the forcing. One can attempt mod elling the sources only and use
this modelled forcing to drive the modiﬁed resolvent operat or, which will be to subject of a
future study. We only showed results for modes at zero freque ncy limit, since these modes
dominate the Couette ﬂow. To further explore the potential o f the method introduced, analysis
of diﬀerent ﬂows at higher /u1D445/u1D452will be conducted.
