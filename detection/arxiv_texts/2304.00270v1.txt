A continuum approach to study magnetoelectric multiferroic BiFeO 3(BFO) is proposed. Our
modeling eort marries the ferroelectric (FE) phase eld method and micromagnetic simulations
in order to describe the entire multiferroic order parameter sector (polarization, oxygen antiphase
tilts, strain, and magnetism) self-consistently on the same time and length scale. In this paper, we
discuss our choice of ferroelectric and magnetic energy terms and demonstrate benchmarks against
known behavior. We parameterize the lowest order couplings of the structural distortions against
previous predictions from density functional theory calculations giving access to simulations of the
FE domain wall (DW) topology. This allows us to estimate the energetic hierarchy and thicknesses
of the numerous structural DWs. We then extend the model to the canted antiferromagnetic order
and demonstrate how the ferroelectric domain boundaries inuence the resulting magnetic DWs. We
also highlight some capabilities of this model by providing two examples relevant for applications.
We demonstrate spin wave transmission through the multiferroic domain boundaries which identify
rectication in qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations. As a second example
of application, we model fully-dynamical magnetoelectric switching, where we nd a sensitivity on
the Gilbert damping with respect to switching pathways. We envision that this modeling eort will
set the basis for further work on properties of arbitrary 3D nanostructures of BFO (and related
multiferroics) at the mesoscale.
I. INTRODUCTION
The phenomenological description of ferroic phase
transitions is characterized by the onset of one or more
order parameters below a critical temperature. In the
case of ferroelectric materials, the order parameter is an
electric dipole condensed from unstable phonon modes1,2.
For ferromagnets, a net nonzero magnetization arises as
ordering dominates thermal spin uctuations below the
Curie point3. In both cases, the theoretical portrayal of
a single order parameter (and its conjugate electric or
magnetic eld) has been quite successful in illustrating
and driving interest in a plethora of functional materials
properties of technological relevance.
Multiferroics are compounds where multiple order pa-
rameters coexist and are coupled together in non-trivial
ways. Magnetoelectric (ME) multiferroics exhibit ferro-
electricity along with a magnetic ordering (which can
be ferromagnetic4, antiferromagnetic5, ferrimagnetic6,
helimagnetic7, etc.). In the context of applications for
electronics, these types of structures are very promising
since the coupling can provide a pathway to controlling
the magnetic (electric) state with an electric (magnetic)
eld5,8,9. Or it is proposed that this coupling can give
rise to new properties not present in either ferroelectric or
magnetic state alone8. For most ME multiferroics how-
ever, this intrinsic coupling can be quite weak leading to
an interest in searching for materials candidates where
this is not the case.A particular ME multiferroic, the perovskite BiFeO 3
(BFO), has been demonstrated to host appreciable spin-
orbit coupling between its ferroelectric (FE) and antifer-
romagnetic (AFM) ordering. In bulk, BFO undergoes
a phase transition to a rhombohedral ferroelectric phase
upon cooling below 1100 K10,11along with a N eel tem-
perature of around 640 K resulting in collinear G-type
AFM order10. Due to its high transition temperatures, it
is a promising material for applications at ambient con-
ditions. In BFO, the polarization Pdisplays an 8-fold
symmetry of domain states aligned along the pseudocu-
bic [111] or equivalent directions. The rhombohedral po-
lar distortion (displacement of the Bi3+and Fe3+atoms
relative to the oxygen atoms) is also accompanied by a
spontaneous antiphase tilting of the FeO 6octahedral oxy-
gen cages about the polar axis. As such, the presence
of the antiphase tilts at adjacent iron sites underpin an
antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)
which causes a canting of the anti-aligned Fe spins12,13.
Therefore, BFO displays a weak net ferromagnetic mo-
mentMdue to noncollinearity in its magnetic structure.
In many samples or in bulk, this canted moment forms a
long-period cycloid with a period of around 64 nm14{17.
Due to its exceptional properties, BFO has been pro-
posed to be used in a number of novel device con-
cepts including beyond-CMOS logic gates18,19, tunnel-
ing magnetoresistant spintronic valves20{22, THz radia-
tion emitters23,24, enhanced piezoelectric elements25,26,
ultrafast acoustic modulators27, or linear electrooptical
components28,29. As miniaturization is a signicant con-arXiv:2304.00270v1  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  1 Apr 20232
cern for next generation device proposals, the thicknesses
of these ME lms synthesized for the aforementioned ap-
plications are in the range of a few 10s of nm to a few
m's16.
As highlighted in recent work30,31, the observed spin
cycloid abruptly changes propagation direction at the FE
domain walls (DWs) indicating its strong coupling to the
polar order. Local measurement techniques suggest that
the 109-71-109sequence of FE DWs display a Bloch-
like character with Protating across the DW with some
sense of chirality31,32leading to open questions as to the
driving force of this phenomena as well as if the ME
coupling can also yield chiral magnetic textures at these
DWs. Additionally, there have been other experimen-
tal observations of unexplained mesoscopic phenomena in
BFO. Piezoforce microscopy measurements have revealed
metastable states in epitaxial thin lms where instead of
the 8-fold possibility of domain orientations, there are 12
which also display an appreciable population of charged
domain boundaries which are controllable by electric eld
cycling33.
A sought-after property of ME multiferroics is the abil-
ity to deterministically switch the magnetization with
electric elds5. Due to the time and length scales in-
volved in the practical implementations of ME switch-
ing, the dynamics of the coupled polar-magnetic texture
is unclear. Supporting theory utilizing atomistic meth-
ods can become computationally intractable due to too
many atoms in the simulation box or a diculty of mod-
eling real interfacial or time-dependent phenomena. As
such, these methodologies can be dicult to implement
to investigate the aforementioned experimentally relevant
scenarios.
In order to investigate the mesoscopic picture of ME
multiferroics taking into account both the ferroelectric
physics and the micromagnetic formalism to describe the
AFM behavior34, we are motivated to develop a contin-
uum model of BFO and its nanostructures. The goal is to
coarse-grain the materials physics into a predictive capa-
bility for large length and time scales in a single calcula-
tion. While the phase eld method has been particularly
useful in understanding the ferroelectric domain topol-
ogy and its response to external stimulii in BFO35,36, a
natural forward progression is to extend this type of con-
tinuum modeling to the spins in the material with micro-
magnetic simulations37,38. This would give access to new
information about the collective spin excitations in the
presence of (and coupled to) the topological defects (for
example its domain walls or the recently experimentally
resolved solitons39in BFO).
To explore these questions in this work, we propose
a coupled multiferroic continuum model that marries
the well-known FE phase eld and micromagnetism self-
consistently on the same time and length-scale. In Sec-
tions II A and II B, we report a comprehensive descrip-
tion of the relevant governing equations and energy terms
for the lattice contribution. We study the FE DWs in
Section II D and establish our predictions of Porderparameter proles (including also the spontaneous oc-
tahedral tilt and strain elds) for a number of dierent
low-energy DWs in BFO. This allows us to parameter-
ize the model-specic gradient coecients by comparing
to density functional theory (DFT) calculations40. Good
agreement is demonstrated with respect to the energy
hierarchy of the dierent low-energy DWs. We also re-
port our model's predictions of Bloch rotational compo-
nents, residual strain elds, and thicknesses of dierent
DW types.
In Sections II E, II F, and II G we expand the model
to include the magnetic order. We simulate the mag-
netic ground states in the presence of homogeneous and
inhomogeneous structural order building on the results
from the previous section. We evaluate the inuence of
dierent types of polar domain boundaries also yielding
estimates of the DW thicknesses, topology, and energies
of the magnetic texture. Then in Section III, we provide
two illustrative examples of the capabilities of our sim-
ulations: (i) spin-wave transport through the multifer-
roic DW boundaries highlighting their rectifying nature;
(ii) fully-coupled dynamical switching of the magnetiza-
tion order with a time-dependent electric eld through
the ME eect demonstrating a non-trivial sensitivity on
physical parameters. While our model (and the exam-
ples provided) is certainly not exhaustive, we hope that
this work will set the basis for further studies on prop-
erties of arbitrary 3D BFO nanostructures (and related
multiferroics) at the continuum approximation of theory.
II. MULTIFERROIC CONTINUUM MODEL
We consider a zero temperature limit free energy den-
sity functional dened as a sum of Landau-type en-
ergy density from the structural distortions of the lattice
(flatt), the magnetic energy density due to the spin sub-
system (fsp) and the magnetostructural coupling ( fMP)
in single crystal BFO,
f=flatt(P;A;") +fsp(L;m) +fMP(L;m;P;A);(1)
where lower case fdenotes a free energy density . In our
continuum description, we need some formal denitions
of the order parameters. The electric polarization Pis
connected to the displacement of Bi3+and Fe3+atoms
relative to the oxygen anions. The vector Adescribes the
rotations of the FeO 6cages where the antiphase correla-
tion between adjacent unit cells is implicitly assumed.
The spontaneous homogeneous strain that arises below
the phase transition is the rank two tensor "with sym-

; (2)
where the variable uiis the component of the elastic dis-
placement vector uwhich is solved for in our problem

For the spin system, BFO is an antiferromagnet with
anti-aligned spins at rst-neighboring Fe sites (G-type)
leading to two distinct sublattices m1andm2. The
quantity Lis the AFM N eel vector which we dene as
L= (m1 m2)=2. Additionally, we have the total mag-
netic moment m= (m1+m2)=2 which accounts for the
weak nonvanishing magnetization that arises due to the
DMI. The quantities Landmare constrained such that

reecting the presence of a strong AFM coupling between
the sublattices but with a weak noncollinearity in m1and

mogeneous contribution to the energy (i.e. the terms not
involvingfrPandfrA) has been previously parameter-
ized with DFT calculations44; we refer the reader to this
publication for the relevant coecients.
However, in the case of the gradient energy, the set
of coecientsfGij,Hijgare dicult to obtain directly
from DFT (see for example the approach outlined in Refs.
[48{50]) - so we employ a tting procedure in Sec. II D
to evaluate them. We should emphasize that if a dif-
ferent bulk homogeneous phenomenological potential is
used (i.e. Refs. [36, 51, 52]), then the gradient coef-
cients obtained would be dierent since they depend
strongly on the energetics of the order parameters in the
vicinity of the DW.

We also investigate electrostatic phenomena in our model

where  Eis the electrostatic potential which denes the
electric eld E= rEin the usual way. The pa-
rameterb= 300is the relative background dielectric
constant53. Eq. (18) is solved at every time step of the
evolution of Eq. (10) and (11). In Sec. II D we are search-
ing for the local minima due to the relaxation dynamics
of Eq. (10) and (11) and as such the time relaxation con-
stants  Pand  Aare set to unity.
To enforce periodicity on the strain tensor components
in our representative volume element that includes DWs,
we separate the strain elds calculated from Eq. (2) and
(12) into homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (lo-
cal) parts. This is done utilizing the method formulated
by Biswas and co-workers in Ref. [54] which relaxes the
stress components along the periodic directions and thus
allows corresponding deformation to occur. Here, the

Equations (10), (11), (12), (18), and (19) are cast into
their weak formulation sucient for the nite element
analysis. Our method uses linear Lagrange shape func-
tions for the coupled variable system. The nite element
mesh spacing is selected to be  x0:1 nm for all cal-
culations in this work. This small mesh spacing helps
resolve the thin DWs in BFO to smoothness which are
discussed extensively in Section II D and II G. We imple-
ment Newmark-beta time integration55with convergence
between time steps achieved when the nonlinear residuals
calculated during the Newton-Raphson iteration (with
block Jacobi preconditioning) have been reduced by 10 8
relative tolerance. If convergence is not obtained, we
use adaptive time stepping with reduction factor of 0 :5.
The nite element method (FEM) implementation of this
work is available within Ferret56which is an add-on
module for the open source Multiphysics Object Oriented
Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework57.
In the absence of order parameter gradients, the ho-
mogeneous FE states of Pparallel to Awhich we denote
asP""Acan be obtained numerically. To perform
this calculation, we evolve Eq. (10) and (11) simulta-
neously solving Eq. (12) (at every time step) until the
relative change in total volume integrated energy den-
sityFbetween adjacent time steps is less than 5 10 7
eV/s. The bulk potential predicts the spontaneous val-
ues of the order parameters upon minimization that are
Ps=jPj= 0:945 C=m2andAs=jAj= 13:398.
The spontaneous normal and shear strains that corre-
spond to these values are "n="ii= 1:30810 2and
"s="ij= 2:9510 3fori6=jin agreement with Ref.
[44]. The free energy density of the ground state given
by Eq. (3) is -15.5653 eV nm 3. The energy functional
used also describes identical energy minima when P"#A
(which is equivalent to a 180phase reversal of the tilt
eld). Since the rotostrictive strains dened in Eq. (14)
are invariant upon full reversal of A, then these numbers
are left unchanged. In the next Section II D we evaluate
the inhomogeneous textures of the DWs and parameter-
ize the gradient coecients fGij;Hijgused in our model.
D. Calculation of gradient coecients
In order to study the domain wall topology involving
spatial variations of P,A, and strain, a good parame-
ter set estimate of the gradient coecients ( G11;H11;:::)
of Eq. (8) and Eq. (9) is needed. To achieve this, we
consult DFT calculations reported by Di eguez and co-
workers in Ref. [40]. It was shown that an assortment
of metastable states are allowed in BFO and that this
zoology of dierent DW types forms an energy hierar-
chy. Due to electrostatic compatibility, this collection
of states has specic requirements on the components of
the order parameters that modulate across the domain
boundary. For example, the lowest energy congurations5

DW where the right inset demonstrates the built-in  E(in
mV) arising from this small rotation. (b) Energy surface as
a function of primary gradient coecients H11andG44with

Table II).
which we denote (see Table I) as 2 =1(100) and 3 =0(110)
are the 109and 180DWs respectively. In this notation,
it is indicated that, for the 2 =1 DW, two components of P
and one component of Aswitch sign across the boundary
whose plane normal is (100), whereas for the 3 =0 DW, P
undergoes a full reversal where Ais unchanged across the
(110)-oriented boundary plane. We label the pairs of the
domains characterizing the DW as PI=AIandPII=AIIin
this table. This determines which terms in Eq. (8) and
(9) are primary contributions to the DW energy. This is
particularly advantageous as it has allowed us to sepa-
rate the computation of specic DWs in the analysis of
tting the gradient coecients to the DFT results.
To obtain the (100)- or (110)-oriented DWs within ourphase eld scheme, we choose an initial condition for the
components of the order parameters to be a sin(x) or
sin(x+y) prole respectively. We then relax Eq. (10), and
(11) until convergence along with satisfying the condi-
tions of mechanical equilibrium of Eq. (12) at every time
step. The periodic boundary conditions on the compo-
nents of P;A;andufor (100)- or (110)-oriented domain
walls are enforced along the [100] and [110] directions
respectively. We compute the DW energy with
FDW=F F0
NS(20)
whereF0is the corresponding monodomain energy from
Eq. (3) integrated over the computational volume V. The
energyFis computed from the solution that contains the
DW prole. The number of DWs in the simulation box
isNandSthe surface area of the DW plane. We nd
convergence on the computed energies within 1 mJ =m2
provided that the DW-DW distances are greater than 30
nm due to long-range strain interactions. For fourth-
order thermodynamic potentials, a t function of the
formWktanh [(r r0)=tk] is sucient to t the evolu-
tion of order parameters that switch across the DW58
whereWkis the value of the switched spontaneous order
parameters far from a DW plane localized at r0andtk
corresponds to the thickness of the polar or octahedral
tilt parameters for k=P;A respectively.
As a rst example, consider the lowest energy DW pre-
dicted by DFT, the so-called 1092/1 (100) DW which
is indeed frequently observed in thin lm samples of
BFO19,59. The primary gradient coecients governing
the energy of the wall are the H11andG44coecients
owing to the fact that Ax;x,Py;x, andPz;xare nonzero
(see Table I). The resulting DW prole for the 2/1 (100)
wall is presented in Fig. 1(a). The prole is a smooth
rotation of both AxandPy=Pzacross the wall region.
The inset on the left reveals that the non-switching com-
ponentPxexperiences a slight decrease (  3%) at the
wall. The quantitative value of the modulation of the
non-switched component is consistent with DFT results
of the same DW type60.
The small change of Pxcorresponds with a built-in  E
shown in the right inset panel which is of comparable
order (10 mV) to those estimated from DFT60. Fit-
ting the P-Aprole shows that the DW is quite thin
(thickness 2 tP0:08 nm). Hence, we obtain DWs with
marked Ising character. We provide an energy prole
scan across the primary coecients H11andG44in (b).
The dashed white line outlines the predictions from DFT
results in Ref. [40]. We also should mention that the de-
pendence on other coecients is quite weak due to the
relatively small gradients in non-switching components.
These calculations (and others not shown here) reveal
that the choice of fGij;Hijgis not unique, i.e. one can
nd the same DW energies (with very similar proles) for
dierent combinations of the primary coecients. There-
fore, it is necessary to visit other DW congurations to
constrain the values of the entire set.6

A), and (c) 2/2 (109) type boundaries. Below in (d), (e),and (f) are the spontaneous strain elds for the normal and shear
components along the same arclength. Far from the DW, the solutions converge to the values ( Ps;As;"s;"n), of the ground
state.
Next, we present P-Aproles of three higher energy
(100)-oriented domain walls (1/1, 0/3, and 2/2) in Fig 2
(a), (b) and (c) respectively. These three calculations cor-
respond to those using our best estimates of the gradient
coecientsfGij;Hijgin Table II. In all three cases, we
nd the presence of a small changes in the non-switching
components of the order parameters shown in circles for
Akand diamonds for Pk. For example, in the 711/1shown in DW Fig 2 (a), Py(in red) which does not change
sign, grows at the DW by about 15%. This is in con-
trast to the Pxcomponent (in blue) which only grows
by 2.5% demonstrating the inuence of the weak built-
in eld which reduces the magnitude of this component
to keep this wall neutral. Similar changes on the or-
der of about 10% are also seen in Ax=Aycomponents
shown in blue. This DW-induced change in Pseems to7
be the largest in the 0/3-type DW shown in (b). Due to
the inuence of built in electric elds from the solution
of the Poisson equation (and our best estimates of the
anisotropic gradient coecients), the value of Pxcompo-
nent grows by about 5% whereas the Py=Pzcompo-
nents diminish by almost -35% (shown in black). Again,
we also nd changes in the non-switching components in
the 1092/2 wall, with Px(blue diamonds) growing by
about 2%; by contrast and Axdecreases by 6:4(blue
circles).
In panels (d), (e), and (f) of Fig. 2, we depict the cor-
responding spontaneous strain proles corresponding to
the cases in panels (a), (b), and (c) respectively. Impor-
tantly, far from the DW plane, the spontaneous values of
the normal (triangles) and shear (squares) components
of the strain converge to their respective values of the
single domain state. However, the strained state of the
DW causes various components of "ijto grow or depress
by large percentages to accommodate the electro- and
rotostrictive coupling intrinsic in this structure. In the
case of the 1/1 DW in (d), the value of the "zz(in black)
shrinks until eventually changing sign (smoothly) at the
domain boundary. For the 2/2 DW, there is a large ten-
sile strain in "xx(in blue) growing by about a factor of
three across the wall.
Also presented in Table I are the DW thicknesses as-
sociated to the corresponding order parameters, which
dier between PandA. We should note that the
thicknesses of the DW corresponding to PandAdif-
fer. This arises because our resulting t parameters are
anisotropic (i.e. H11H44) and also the presence of
growth/decrease in non-switching components of Pand
Adue to the roto- and electrostrictive coupling. Never-
theless, as seen in the table, the domain walls are quite
thin (2tk0:05 0:5 nm) which agrees quite-well with
the available literature on BFO suggesting atomistically
thin DWs40,60{62. The smaller value of the DW thickness
in the A(as compared to P) also shows good qualitative
agreement with measurements from experiments using
Z-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy62.
We extend this type of analysis iteratively for the pos-
sible DWs listed in Table I so that we can converge
our set of coecients yielding reasonable FDWvalues
comparable to DFT; importantly, capturing the energy
hierarchy40,60,63predicted for the collection of walls. Our

E. Antiferromagnetic energy terms
Now we turn to the AFM order present in BFO.
To encapsulate the magnetic behavior of single crys-
talline BFO, we propose a continuum-approximation to
the magnetic free energy density. We consider the to-
tal free energy density of the magnetic subsystem ( fmag)
to be a sum of the terms responsible for the nominally
collinear AFM sublattices ( fsp) and those producing the
noncollinearity (canted magnetism) by coupling to the
structural order ( fMP). We rst consider the magnetic
energy due to the spin subsystem that is not coupled to
the structural order,

whereDe<0 controls the strength of the short-range
superexchange energy which favors the spins to have
collinear AFM ordering67. At our coarse-grained level
of theory, we only consider the rst nearest-neighbor ex-
change coupling which has been calculated from rst-
principles methods42to be approximately 6 meV/f.u.
corresponding to De= 23:4 meV=nm3in our simula-
tions. The second term describes the AFM non-local
exchange stiness proposed in Ref. [15] with Ae= 18:7
meV/nm (or 310 7ergs/cm). The third term cor-
responds to a weak single-ion anisotropy41withKc
1=
2:210 3eV/nm 3; this term reects the cubic sym-
metry of the lattice and breaks the continuous degeneracy
of the magnetic easy-plane into a six-fold symmetry.
The remaining terms are due to the magnetostructual
coupling,
fMP=fDMI(A) +feasy(P) +fanis(A); (22)
where
fDMI=D0A(Lm); (23)
is due to the antisymmetric DMI which acts to break
the collinearity by competing energetically with the rst
term of Eq. (21). It should be emphasized here that
the local oxygen octahedral environments of adjacent Fe
atoms underpins the DMI vector12,68{71. Therefore, the
Aorder parameter enables the DMI coupling. Ref. [13]8
provides an estimate of the DMI energy corresponding
to 304eV/f.u. It should be mentioned that the weak
canting between m1andm2arises from a competition
betweenDeandD0and that dierent estimates of their
values can provide the same degree of canting of the sub-
lattices provided they have the same ratio De=D0. We
come back to this in the next section.
BFO is an easy-plane antiferromagnet13, in which the
magnetic sublattices lie in a plane dened by the direc-
tion of P. We include the magnetocrystalline anisotropy
term67requisite for easy-plane AFMs as,
feasy=2X

ods, Dixit and co-workers13, determined that the relative

tices along Por in the plane normal to Pis 2:0 meV/f.u.
Therefore, we choose K1= 31:25meV=nm3for our simu-
lations.
We further couple the magnetic energy surface to
the structural order by allowing the weak single-ion
anisotropy to also depend on the antiphase tilts A41

which is in addition to the term in Eq. (21). The choice
ofKc
1>0 and 0< ajAj2< Kc
1corresponds to a small
energy barrier between the 6-fold possible orientations of
the weak magnetization mthus breaking the continuous
degeneracy in the easy-plane. These coecients can be
obtained from DFT calculations as shown in Refs [13]
and [41]. Therefore, we choose our coecients (see Table
III) such that the relative energy density barrier for the
six-fold symmetry is 0.01 meV/nm3which is a reasonable
approximation based on the aforementioned works. We
nd no inuence of this choice of coupling constant on
the results presented in this manuscript. The coecients
forfspandfMPare listed in Table III.

We should note that a long-period ( 64 nm) cy-
cloidal rotation of the weak magnetization is often ob-
served in BFO samples15{17. It is possible to eliminatethe cycloidal order by doping72, epitaxial strain14,16,73,
applied electric elds74, or by some processing techniques
(i.e. via a critical lm thickness)16during synthesis. The
spin-cycloid could be incorporated into our model by in-
cluding coupling terms associated with a proposed spin-
current mechanism15,43,75. However, in order to provide
the simplest model of the ME multiferroic eects, we have
neglected them in this work.
F. Micromagnetics and homogeneous spin ground
states
In order to nd the spin ground states in the presence
of an arbitrary structural elds, we consider the Landau-
Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation76that governs the sublat-
ticesm,

permeability of vacuum. The saturation magnetization
density of the BFO sublattices is Ms= 4:0B/Fe41{43.
The third term arises from the LLB approximation in the
zero temperature limit where ~ kis a damping along the
longitudinal direction of m. We implement the LLB
equation as a numerical resource in order to provide a
restoring force and bind the quantities mto the unit
sphere (jmj= 1). In this context, we consider our spin
subsystem to be at T= 0 K in results presented through-
out in this paper. In the Appendix, we provide a short
derivation of the LLB torque in the zero temperature
limit. We set ~ k= 103in all results in this work to
satisfy the constraint on m.
To look for homogeneous spin ground states, we con-
sider= 0:05 and evolve Eq. 26 (utilizing the numer-
ical approach described in Sec. II C) until the relative
change in the total energy computed from the summa-
tion of Eq. (21) and Eq. (22) between adjacent time steps
is F < 10 8eV/s. Also, we stress that the inu-
ence of ~kis negligible in all results presented in this
work provided that its unitless value is around 103or
above. To verify that our ground states predict the mag-
netic ordering consistent with the literature of BFO, we

. The former tracks the de-
gree of canting between the sublattices and the latter
tracks the orientation of the magnetization with respect
to^P=P=Ps, the magnetic easy-plane normal. As an
example, we rst set P""Aalong the [111] direction9

lattices have relaxed into the easy plane dened by ^P

canting angle WFMduring the relaxation is shown. At
the conclusion of the ringdown, WFMreaches a value of
1:22). This demonstrates that the angular quantities
f;WFMgdetail an orthogonal system of the fP;m;Lg
vectors as often discussed in the literature5.
As a further benchmark, we probe the inuence of
the ratioDe=D0on the values of WFM. This test,
shown in Fig. 4 highlights the energetic competition
between the AFM superexchange and the sublattice
DMI. From Ref. [42] we have De= 23:4 meV/nm3
and our analysis demonstrates WFM= 1:22provided
D0As= 0:036 meV/nm3. We thus have the weak mo-
mentMsjmj= 0:03B/Fe, which agrees well with the
available literature13,42,77,78.
By setting P""Aalong the eight polar directions
possible in BFO, we can nd six magnetic states for each
of them. The corresponding 48 multiferroic domains are
listed in Table IV. For all morientations calculated, the
canted angle is precisely WFM= 1:22. Additionally,

but not the sign of the N eel vector L. Hence, we have
a total of 96 possible domain variants. Due to the DMI
these quantities listed in this table are canted slightly
from their listed values (hence the use of 'symbol).
G. Antiferromagnetic domain walls
Using low-energy electron microscopy (X-PEEM),
AFM domain boundary contrast can be visualized79
within a single ferroelectric domain. To better under-
stand the capabilities of our modeling eort, we attempt
to stabilize an AFM DW (i.e., one with switched L) cor-
responding to the above experimental observations. We10

and2for 1/1 (c) indicate a much longer range coupling of the spin across the ME boundary than in the 2/1 case in (d).
setP""Aalong [11 1] to be homogeneous (and xed
in time) within the computational box. Then, a sin(x)
prole is chosen for the sublattices mcorresponding to
two possible N eel orientations of Table IV for a (100)-
oriented domain boundary with homogeneous P. After
relaxation Eq. (26) with large Gilbert damping = 0:8,
we nd that the AFM wall is not stable and the system
evolves to a homogeneous state with Lcorresponding to
one of the six possible orientations allowed in the domain.
If the non-local exchange interaction governed by Ae15is
reduced by a factor of ten, then we nd that the solution
corresponds to AFM domain walls with a 120rotation
ofL, i.eLI= [011] and LII= [110]. We estimate that
the corresponding DW in Lhas a characteristic width of
20 nm and a corresponding DW energy of 7 :55 mJ/m2
using Eq. (20).
Let us now consider how the structural DWs aect
the net magnetization. The modulation of PandA
across the domain boundary drastically alters the mag-
netostructural coupling energy surface due to Eq. (22)
causing the AFM order to choose preferential orienta-
tions associated with those calculated in Table IV. Care-
ful inspection of Table IV suggests that only certain low
energy magnetic DWs (i.e., those minimizing the gradi-
ent of L) should be observed for the dierent FE domain
walls listed in Table I. Using our previously established
notation for adjacent DW states, the lowest energy FE
DW (2/1) corresponding to a PI=AI= [111]=[111] to
PII=AII= [111]=[111] change will only allow mI= [211]
ormI= [211] and mII= [211] ormII= [211] respectivelywith no changes to the N eel vector L. This coincides with
a 71rotation of mconsistent with a 71change of the
oxygen octahedral tilt eld Aalbeit having a 109P
switch.
To calculate the magnetic textures numerically, we x
in time the FE order parameters P-Acorresponding to
a specic DW in Sec. II D. We choose the 1/1 (100) and
2/1 (100) structural walls as they are most commonly
observed in experiment. Again, we use a large Gilbert
damping= 0:8 and look for the ground states utilizing
Eq. (26). In Fig. 5, we display the weak mmoment as
a function of the distance to the DW plane for the 1/1
(a) and 2/1 (b) walls after relaxation. In both cases, the
mrotates by 71- [112] to [ 112] in (a) and [211] to [2 11]
in (b) - with a sharp interface region. This is expected
as the DMI term is driven by the Avector forcing m
to also change by 71. The large value of Aecauses the
N eel vector to be nearly constant across the DW corre-
sponding to [1 10] in (a) and [0 11] in (b) as it satises
both conditions of the ground state in adjacent domains.
Fitting the switched components of mto the aforemen-
tioned tanh(x) prole from Sec. II D yields 2 tm= 0:5
nm. We can calculate a thickness of 2 tm= 0:06 nm in
the 2/1 (100) case demonstrating a nearly atomistically
thin DW in the magnetic texture. A comparison to Table
I shows that we have an equality of tmtAin both 1/1
(100) and 2/1 (100) walls.
The component of mthat does not switch, black in
(a) and blue in (b), changes by about +6% and 20%
respectively across the DW region indicating rotational11
components of m. This leads to a deviations of the an-
gular quantitiesfWFM;1;2gfrom their ground state
values. We plot these quantities in panels (c) and (d)
of Fig. 5. We see that, in the 1/1 (100) case in (c), the
sublattices cant slightly ( 1) out of the easy plane
to facilitate this magnetic reversal. The weak magneti-
zation canting angle WFM(shown in blue) also reduces
its magnitude by about 0 :25. This is dierent from the
behavior of the angular quantities of the 2/1 (100) DW
shown in panel (d) which decrease their values by about
0:4in the same fashion indicating canting out of the
easy-plane in the same direction for both sublattices re-
sulting in a slight reduction of m. We stress that these
quantities should be meaningful since they are on the
order ofWFMin the ground state and that in the 1/1
(100) case, the modulations extend more than a few unit
cells from the DW ( 2 nm).
By using Eq. (20), we can estimate the energy of the
magnetic DW of the 1/1 (100) and 2/1 (100) cases. For
the 1/1 and 2/1 walls, we calculate Fmag
DW = 0:71 and
0:70 mJ/m2respectively. The energy dierence between
these two 71mDWs is quite small despite having a very
dierent prole of andWFM. The variation of in
panel (c) for the 1/1 (100) case causes a large relative
increase in the easy-plane anisotropy for both sublattice
contributions as compared to (d) for the 2/1 (100) DW.
However, as seen in the panel (d), there is more identi-
ably sharp structure (i.e., modulations of WFMand
occur within0:2 nm of the DW) as mswitches by 71.
This leads to an increase in the DMI energy relative to
the 1/1 case. We have only presented data on these two
types of magnetic boundaries in the presence of the P-A
DWs. Higher energy DWs can also be investigated with
our approach, but we leave this for future work.
III. APPLICATIONS: SPIN WAVES AND
MAGNETOELECTRIC SWITCHING
A. Spin waves through multiferroic domain
boundaries
The eld of spintronics relies on the generation, con-
trol, and read-out of traveling packets of spin80. In
AFMs, the spin precessional processes can occur at
low energy and ultrafast frequencies (THz and above)
thus leading to competitive advantages in informa-
tion processing design as compared to standard CMOS
technology81,82. The basic concept of wave transmis-
sion and reection phenomena is key to understanding
how to optimize spin wave transport in these systems.
Recently, researchers established non-volatile control of
thermal magnon transport in BFO using electric elds19.
Their work demonstrates that the 109FE DWs act as
a barrier to spin transport across a length-scale compris-
ing many 100s of nm and dampen the detected magnon
signal useful for the device. We will illustrate the use-
fulness of our approach by showing how it can enable amesoscopic simulation of this situation
We consider the two of the commonly observed DWs
in BFO experiments, the 1092/1 and 711/1 (100)-
oriented boundaries5,19,83. The reader is referred to Ta-
ble I and the previous section for the initial conditions of
the order parameters. There is a large relative dierence
between the lattice and spin DW energies. This suggests
that any application of an external magnetic eld Happl
should not appreciably inuence the PandAsubsystem.
Therefore, we x in time the structural order parameters
in this section. We couple Happlto act on the net mag-
netization through the Zeeman free energy density,
fZeeman = mHappl (27)
and add it to the total free energy of the spin congura-
tion.
In order to perturb the system, we consider gaussian
spin wave beams generated by a eld of the form84,
Happl=H0sinc[k0(x x0)]e p0(x x0)2
sinc[!0(t t0)]^h
where eld amplitude H0= 184 kOe, excitation location
x0, gaussian intensity prole parameter p0= 0:16 nm 2,
andk0= 10 nm 1control the perturbation distribution
in spacetime. The director ^horients the magnetic eld
with respect to m. Finally, we cut-o the pulse at t0= 1
ps and excite the spin waves at a frequency !0.
Eq. (26) is evolved with = 0 and Eq (28). We enforce
periodicity in our computational volume along the x;y;z
for the m1andm2variables. The time-integration of
Eq. (26) is set for dt< 2 fs time steps to ensure numerical
convergence for the fast AFM dynamics in the system.
We verify that our calculations are in the linear limit
by adjusting the H0and determine that the perturbed
amplitudes of mscale linearly. Finally, we monitor the
system total free energy Fsp+FMPandjmj(via the LLB
term) and verify that they are constant to within oating
point accuracy for all time in our = 0 simulation.
In Fig. 6(a), we track the excess free energy density
fexc(t;x) =fmag(t;x) fmag(t= 0;x). Therefore, fexc
corresponds to a small energy that is injected into our
computational volume by the spin excitation at time
t. A few snapshots of the fexc(t;x) due to the propa-

to determine which percentage of the excess energy due
to the incoming wave is reected or absorbed by the DW,
i.e., the degree of rectication. We see in Fig. 6(b) that
Rvaries substantially across several decades in frequency
with an asymptote for low frequencies corresponding to
about 35 % and 50 % rectication for the 2/1 and 1/1
walls respectively. The relative dierence between recti-
cation arises from the excitation of the DW region by the
spin wave (seen in Fig. 6(a) for t >24:6 ps). To verify
this, we track the time integrated fexcat the DW re-
vealing almost all of the excess energy is absorbed by the
DW. In this analysis, we nd that only a small portion of
fexcdue to this spin wave is reected (not shown). When
the frequency is increased, a maximum in DW excess en-
ergy absorption in Ris acquired around 1-2 THz before
Rabruptly decreases indicating that the DW becomes
more transparent to the spin wave. Similar frequency-
dependent transmission ratios have been reported in the
literature for noncollinear AFMs85. We should mention
that we did not nd any meaningful inuence of ^hork0
on our results except changing the relative rectication
between the two types of walls, but a more detailed study
of the parameters is warranted.
Finally, we should comment on how this agrees with
experimental observations. In the work of Parsonet et
al19, the propagating thermal magnon signal inferred
from the inverse spin Hall eect was seen to decay expo-
nentially as a function of distance from the source. This
was postulated as due to the 2/1 (100)-oriented DWsin the system acting as a barrier to spin currents with
kjj[100] whose number increased upon electrode separa-
tion; we can conclude that our results support this con-
clusion qualitatively. It remains to be seen if domain en-
gineering techniques guided by similar calculations could
possibly help control the rectication that impedes e-
cient control of magnon signals in ME spintronics. Also,
we should mention that as opposed to our approach de-
tailed in this section, in principle PandAcould vary
in time. This would lead to electromagnonic eects lo-
calized to the DWs upon excitation of inhomogeneous
magnetic and/or electric elds (as highlighted in recent
Refs. [86, 87]). It is possible that the coupled vibrations
of the structural order could further inuence the spin
transport. However, this is a outside the scope of this
work and warrants future studies.
B. Magnetoelectric switching of the AFM order
A considerable demand in AFM spintronics is to nd
an adequate approach to manipulate the magnetic order
with external stimulii. In the case of BFO, since this ma-
terial displays an intrinsic electric dipole moment, it has
been proposed to use an electric eld to manipulate and
control the magnetic texture. The technological bene-
ts to the prospect of electric eld control of magnetism
has been considered for some time5,19,88{90. While low-
frequency deterministic switching of mwith an electric13

eld has been experimentally demonstrated5, the dynam-
ical processes of the coupled polar-magnetic order is still
a topic of research37,38. We aim to highlight one such use
of this modeling eort for the case of ME switching (i.e.,
using an electric eld to switch m).
We now consider a fully-dynamical simulation where
all system variables fP;A;u;m1,m2gdepend on time.
As we are now interested in real dynamics, the time re-
laxation constants   P= 200 Fm 1s 1and  A= 83188
deg2m3J 1s 1in Eq. (10) and (11) are taken from Ref.
[91]. For our switching simulations, our initial condition
of the P""Asystem is along the [111] direction and ho-
mogeneous . Since this is a homogeneous calculation, this
can be considered the macrospin limit of Eq. (26). Since
the dynamics of the AFM order are in general very fast
(characteristic frequencies of 100s of GHz to the THz
regime)81, we introduce a time stepping constraint on
the evolution of Eq. (26) for dt <0:1 ps to ensure nu-
merical convergence. There is no spin dissipation from
conduction electrons in BFO due to its insulating na-
ture. Therefore, we choose of order 10 3which is a
reasonable assumption for BFO92,93and other magnetic
insulators94{97.
As one example to switch the zcomponent of P, wechoose our electric eld Eto beE(!) =h0;0;E0sin (!t)i
withE0= 1800 MV/m. This is a large value
compared to coercive elds of Ec= 20 40 MV/m
observed in switching experiments of thin lm BFO
heterostructures5,98. However, it is well-known that the
coercive eld needed to fully switch components of P
in perovskite FEs is intrinsically linked to the occurence
of various phenomena99{103that are not present in our
homogeneous switching simulations. We select an Efre-
quency of!= 600 MHz. The eld is abruptly turned
o after Phas switched in order to facilitate only one
switching event for analysis. The initial state is homo-
geneous P""Aalong [111] with Ljj[101] and mjj[111]
as one of the possibilities listed in Table IV. In order to
investigate if the ME switching has dependency on , we
pick two dierent values = 0:003 and= 0:01 and
evolve Eq. (10) and (11) in the presence of the eld.
Here we see in Fig. 7(a) and (b), the application of E
along thezdirection switches the P(and also A, not
shown) orientation to [11 1] within 1000 ps (dashed black
line). We use the notation i!fto denote initial states
iand nal states ffor thefm;Lgsystem. The change
of the energy surface through the magnetostructural cou-
pling causes Lto switch orientation from [ 101] to [0 11]14
FIG. 8. Instantaneous switching of the N eel vector Lfor (a)
= 0:003 and (b) = 0:01. The switch occurs abruptly at
t= 200 ps causing the AFM order to rapidly oscillate. The
initial state is Ljj[101] leading to nal states of Ljj[101] and
Ljj[011] in (a) and (b) respectively.
in (a) and [ 101]![101] in (b). At the same time, the
direction of mundergoes [1 21]![211] and [1 21]![121]
transitions in (c) and (d). When one compares the dy-
namics between the left and right panels of Fig. 7, it is
evident that the choice of inuences the nal fm;Lg
state despite having nearly identical ringdown patterns
at the temporal vicinity of the Pswitch shown in the
insets of (c) and (d). Shortly after the switch ( t>1000
ps), the magnetization evolves dierently, due to dier-
ent maximum amplitudes, leading to transition pathways
which overcome dierent energy barriers.
We also consider an instantaneous limit of the switch-
ing process where the Pzis switched immediately. In Fig.
8(a) and (b) which correspond to the same values as
in 7(a) and (b), the switch is set to occur at t= 200 ps
(shown in the insets). The relaxation of Eq. (26) with
the damping set to = 0:003 and 0:01 creates many
oscillations with a characteristic ringdown frequency of
approximately 127 GHz. We nd that indeed, the same
situation happens presented in Fig. 8(a) and (b) as in
Fig. 7(a) and (b) with the nal states of Ldetermined
by its initial orientation and the nal conguration of P.
The vector m(not shown) has trajectories [1 21]![211]
and [1 21]![121] in Fig. 8(a) and (b) respectively. In
the simulations corresponding to Fig. 7, the switching of
moccurs in about a 200 ps time window, whereas with
the instantaneous calculation, the switching pathway re-quires at least 1 ns to ring down fm;Lgwith realistic
material values of = 0:003. This is far above the the-
oretical switching limit of 30 ps proposed by Liao and
co-workers37,38who also utilized a LLG model for the
AFM order coupled to a Landau-type parameterization.
We stress that both of these numerical simulations are
exercises for illustrative purposes and are simplied ver-
sions of the dynamic processes that would happen in an
experiment. Our calculations already suggest two things:
(1) the Gilbert damping controls the maximum ampli-
tude of the oscillations and thus the nal state, hence it
needs to be understood in BFO to have a repeatable ef-
fect and that (2) the dynamics of the structural switching
does not seem to be essential in controlling the switch-
ing pathway (i.e. comparing the explicit time dependent
Ecalculations vs, the instantaneous P-Aswitches). A
more detailed investigation remains for the future.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
We have presented a continuum model for BFO able
to treat the polar, octahedral tilt, spontaneous strain,
and the AFM order in a single calculation. This model
is built upon micromagnetic and FE phase eld approx-
imations to the system order parameters. Our model
is benchmarked against the known behavior in this ma-
terial - specically, we have parameterized the FE DW
proles along with their spontaneous strain elds obtain-
ing an energy hierarchy of possible states in agreement
with DFT calculations40. We also provide simulations of
fL;mgin the presence of low energy FE DWs revealing
delicate features in the angular quantities characterizing
the canted magnetism. Next, we illustrated the useful-
ness of the model with two simple applications i) AFM
spin waves traversing the multiferroic domain boundary
highlighting a rectifying nature in qualitative agreement
with recent experiments19and ii) fully-dynamical ME
switching in real-time which, interestingly, reveals a sen-
sitivity of switching pathways on the Gilbert damping.
There are many other phenomena in BFO that could
be built upon our model. As is often discussed in
the literature regarding BFO, is the appearance of
a long-period spin cycloid15,16in which the proposed
origin is underpinned by an asymmetric spin-current
mechanism17,71,75,104which is necessary to stabilize these
patterns. While the results of this paper are for the
weakly non-collinear AFM order, one can appreciate that
the presence of the spin cycloid might aect the outcome
of our illustrative examples. We also emphasize that the
DMI expression in Eq. (23) is isotropic and that the ap-
plication of strain should break the symmetry which can
lead to dierent AFM sublattice ordering as detailed in
Ref. [13]. In principle, both the spin-exoelectric (spin
cycloid) and magnetoelastic (epitaxial strain) contribu-
tions could inuence the antisymmetric exchange leading
to drastically altered magnetization textures in the simu-
lations. In general also, this type of multiferroic modeling15
could be extended to other noncollinear antiferromagnets
such as those where electric elds have been shown to ma-
nipulate the magnetic state despite lack of spontaneous
FE order105,106.
The model is built within the Ferret56module atop
the open-source Multiphysics Object Oriented Simula-
tion Environment (MOOSE) framework57. As a nod to
open-science, we provide representative examples for all
of the results in this paper to be hosted on a GitHub
website107.Ferret is part of a forward-integrating
toolset called the Continuous Integration, Verication,
Enhancement, and Testing (CIVET)108utility which pre-
serves reproducibility of our results by ensuring underly-
ing code changes to the MOOSE software stack do not
break the module. The sets of governing equations and
energy terms in this paper, which are applicable in 3D
and for any geometry, are available and documented as
C++objects within the open-source software repository.
While our modeling eort is certainly not exhaustive, we
believe it will be a useful platform for development of
continuum simulations of BFO and other multiferroics
in length and time-scales are not accessible by atomistic
methodologies.

APPENDIX
In micromagnetic simulations in which thermal uctu-
ations are not included (so-called athermal simulations),
the magnetization density must remain constant in mag-
nitude, thus preserving the unit norm of the magneti-
zation director ^m=M=jMj. In nite-dierence codes
on regular meshes, such as MuMax3109, enforcing this
constraint is simple: each simulation cell kcontains one
unit vector ^mkthat can simply be renormalized after,
e.g., each time step. In contrast, in weak-formulation
FEM codes the continuum magnetic degrees of freedom
are approximated by shape functions on irregular mesh
cells and integrated over, and normalization of m(r) is
not as easily interpreted or made meaningful as in nite-
dierence codes.
One can overcome this problem, for example using, a
representation of m(r) in spherical coordinates110, but
numerical solutions of the equations of motion can be-
come unstable leading to serious convergence issues. An-
other possibility is to introduce the constraint through
a Lagrangian multiplier or using special shape functions
on the tangent plane of the magnetization director vec-tor eld111,112. We chose a dierent path, which is
physically grounded in the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB)
formulation76,113,114. The key point in the LLB formu-
lation is that longitudinal uctuations in the magnetiza-
tion director are allowed, but countered by a penalty for
deviations away from the thermodynamic average of the
magnitude m(T) at a temperature T. The longitudinal
uctuations add a term to the equation of motion that is
given by
