Abstract
Shadows of the Kerr-Newman-dS black hole surrounded by quin tessence and a cloud of
strings are investigated. For a spherically symmetric nonr otating black hole, its shadow is
circular and its size is independent of an observation angle and a plane on which a circular
photon orbit exists. The shadow sizes are signiﬁcantly inﬂu enced by the parameters involving
thecloudof strings, quintessenceparameter, magnitudeof quintessential stateparameter, and
cosmological constant. Theblack hole shadows increase wit h the cloud of strings andnegative
quintessential state parameter increasing or the quintess ence parameter and cosmological
constant decreasing. When the black hole is spinning and axi ally symmetric, the black hole
shadow is dependent on the observation angle and the black ho le spin. The eﬀects of the
parameters excluding the spin parameter and the observatio n angle on the sizes of black hole
shadows in the rotating case are similar to those in the nonro tating case. The black hole
shadows decrease as the black hole spins increase. When the o bservation angle in the range
of 0 and π/2 is large, the black hole shadow is deformed like the D shape f or a high spin, but
is close to a circle for a low spin. When the observation angle is small, the black hole shadow
seems to be a circle regardless of the high or low spin case. Ba sed on the Event Horizon

these parameters. For slowly rotating black holes, the allo wed regions of the parameters
including the cosmological constant are given.

11 Introduction
The theory of general relativity predicts the existence of b lack holes in the universe. This
prediction has been conﬁrmed through lots of observation ev idences. These evidences include
the detections of the gravitational waves by LIGO [1] and the observations of the images of
supermassive black hole M87* and SgrA* shadows by the Event H orizon Telescope (EHT)
[2].
The shadow of a black hole is a black disk seen by an observer in the sky when the black
hole is illuminated by a light source. This light source is di stributed around the black hole
but not between the observer and the black hole. The computat ion of black hole shadow
is directly related to the study of photon regions, photon ri ngs or spheres outside the event
horizon of the black hole. For a Schwarzschild black hole wit h massM, the bound photon
orbits occur at r= 3M, and the critical impact parameter is ξc= 3√
3M, which is the radius
of observed photon ring or black hole shadow. In fact, the cir cle being the apparent shape
of the shadow of a spherically symmetric black hole was ﬁrst s hown by Synge [3]. Luminet
[4] focused on the appearance of Schwarzschild black hole su rrounded by an accretion disk.
Two impact parameters are useful to determine the apparent p ositions of the shadow of an
axially symmetric Kerr black hole, which was ﬁrst investiga ted by Bardeen [5]. The shadow
of a rotating black hole is no longer circular. The spin of the black hole leads to the deviation
of the shadow from a circle. There have been many other intere sting studies concerning the
shadows of Kerr-Newman black holes [6-8], Kerr-Newman-NUT Black Holes [9], and black
holes surrounded by extra matter sources [10-14]. The shado ws of black holes in modiﬁed
gravity have also been considered in numerous publications (see e.g. [15-24]). The obtained
shadow images combined with the observations of M87* and Sgr A* shadows are helpful to
test theories of gravity and to understand the geometrical s tructure of the event horizon and
the parameters of black holes.
The length of a shadow boundary and a local curvature radius a re two characterizations
of a black hole shadow [25,26]. The shadow boundary is a one-d imensional closed or open
curve. For a spherically symmetric nonrotating black hole, the curvature radius of the black
hole shadow is the radius of photon ring. For an axially symme tric nonvanishing spin black
hole, the curvature radius has maximum and minimum values [2 7,28]. The minimum and
maximum of the curvature radius determine lower and upper bo unds of the shadow size.
Based on the observation of M87*, the black hole parameters c an be constrained via the
curvature radius.
Although the theory of general relativity has been conﬁrmed successfully through the
observations concerning the gravitational waves and the im ages of supermassive black holes,
it cannot completely explain the accelerated expansion of t he universe. This accelerated
expansion is caused by a negative pressurefrom agravitatio nally repulsiveenergy component.
A possible origin of the negative pressure is quintessence d ark energy [29-33]. Dark energy
as an unknown form of energy accounts for a predominant part o f the total energy in the
universe. Quintessence is a kind of dark energy described by a minimally coupled scalar
ﬁeld. The state equation of the dark energy is very associate d with the cosmological constant
or vacuum energy. Therefore, the cosmological constant is a nother possible origin of the
accelerated expansion of the universe. The universe is also thought of as a collection of
extended objects like one-dimensional strings instead of p oint particles, termed a cloud of
strings [34,35]. The spacetime structures of black holes ca n be aﬀected typically by the
cosmological constant, quintessence and cloud of strings. Fathi et al. [36] gave analytical
expressions to the radii of planar and polar spherical photo n orbits around a rotating black
hole with quintessential ﬁeld and cloud of strings. Critica l orbits of particles and photons in
the Schwarzschild black hole with quintessence and string c loud background spacetimes were
2investigated by Surya Shankar [37]. Mustafa et al. [38] stud ied the inﬂuence of the cloud
of string parameter and the quintessential parameter on the radius of the shadow of the
Schwarzschild black hole and the weak defection angle. He et al. [39] considered the shadow
and photon sphere of the Schwarzschild black bole in clouds o f strings and quintessence with
static and infalling spherical accretions. Eﬀect of quintes sential dark energy on black hole
shadows was discussed by Singh [40]. Atamurotov et al. [41] i nvestigated the null geodesics
and the shadow cast by the Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier bl ack hole for diﬀerent spacetime
parameters consisting of the quintessence parameter, the c loud of string parameter, the spin
parameter and the charge of the black hole. The metrics consi dered in the literature are parts
of the KNdS black hole spacetimes.
Now, we are interested in the study of shadows of Kerr-Newman -de Sitter (KNdS) black
holes withquintessence and acloud of strings[29-31]. We pa rticularly focus onthe shadowsof
KNdS black holes and constraining the black hole parameters through the curvature radius.
For the sake of our purpose, we introduce the null geodesic ar ound the KNdS black holes
and discuss circular and spherical photon orbits in Section 2. In Section 3, we obtain the
shadow curves observed by a locally rest observer, and analy ze the local curvature radius for
the black hole shadows. Then the parameters are constrained . Finally, we summarize our
main results in Section 4.
2 Photon motions near KNdS black holes with ex-
tra sources
At ﬁrst, we introduce a KNdS black hole with quintessence and a cloud of strings. Then, a
Hamiltonian for the description of photons moving around th e black hole is provided. Finally,
circular photon orbits and spherical photon orbits are disc ussed.
2.1 KNdS black hole metric
In Boyer-Lindquist coordinates ( t,r,θ,φ), the KNdS black hole surrounded by quintessence
and a cloud of strings is described by the following metric [2 9]

the condition −1< ωq<−1/3 in a scenario of the accelerated expansion universe. bcdenotes
a positive parameter measuring the intensity of the cloud of strings [29], and Λ is a positive
cosmological constant. In fact, this metric is a solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equation with
the cosmological constant, which can be obtained from the Ne wman-Janis transformation
of the nonrotating black hole solution. The total stress-en ergy tensor in the nonrotating
solution is a superposition of three extra sources includin g the quintessence, cloud of strings
and electromagnetic ﬁeld. See Refs. [37-39] for more inform ation on the KNdS spacetime
with quintessence and cloud strings. The speed of light cand the constant of gravity Gare

Now, let us consider the domains of outer communication. We f ormally write ∆ ras
∆r= (r−r+)(r−r−)(r−rc)f(r), (6)
wherer±represent the outer and inner horizons of the black hole, rcdenotes the cosmological
horizon [16], and f(r) is a function of r. If the parameters Q,a,bc,αq,ωqand Λ are chosen
appropriately, the equation ∆ r= 0 has three real roots r±andrc. Figure 1 plots two
parameter spaces for the existence of the real root rc, where the other parameters are given.
Thus, light rays can reach a rest observer’s eyes within the r egionr+≪r0≤rc, wherer0

the mass factor Mis eliminated or becomes 1 in the Lagrangian.
On the basis of the dimensionless Lagrangian, the photon has a covariant 4-momentum

Two equations regarding ˙tand˙φcan be obtained from Eqs. (9) and (10). They are also
parts of the null geodesic equations, but are not written bec ause they are not used in this
paper.
Several notable points are given here. ( i) The Carter constant Kis a fourth constant of
motion intheHamiltonian system (11). Itsexistence isbeca usetheHamilton-Jacobi equation
(13) allows the separation of variables. Thus, the null geod esic is integrable and regular. ( ii)
When the photon gives place to a test particle, the Hamilton- Jacobi equation still allows
the separation of variables and then the Hamiltonian (11) ha s a Carter constant nonequal
toK. (iii) When an external electromagnetic ﬁeld surrounds the black hole (that is, this
electromagnetic ﬁeld is included in the Hamiltonian (11)), the Carter constant is not present
for the motion of a charged particle near the black hole, but i t is if the cosmological constant
vanishes, as was reported in Ref. [29].
2.3 Circular and spherical photon orbits
GivenR(r) = 0 in Eq. (17), the energy is solved by
E+=aL
a2+r2+√K∆r
Ξ(a2+r2). (21)
Taking two impact parameters
ξ=L
E, η=K
E2, (22)
we deﬁne an eﬀective potential
V=E+
E=aξ
a2+r2+√η∆r
Ξ(a2+r2). (23)
Notice that E+in Eq. (23) is a function of rgiven by Eq. (21), and Ein Eq. (23) is a
certain given value of the energy. In terms of the two impact p arameters, Eqs. (17) and (18)
are rewritten as
R(r)
E2= Ξ2[(a2+r2)−aξ]2−η∆r=¯R(r), (24)
Θ(θ)
E2=η∆θ−Ξ2(ξcscθ−asinθ)2=¯Θ(θ). (25)
Using Eq. (18), Rahaman et al. [43] obtained another eﬀective potential
Ve= 1−/parenleftbiggdr
d¯λ/parenrightbigg2
= 1−¯R(r)
Σ2, (26)
where¯λ=λ/E.
62.3.1 Circular photon orbits
If Θ(θ) = 0 in Eq. (25) for any time λ, thenθremains invariant and photon orbits are always
lying on a certain two-dimensional plane θ=ϑ. In this case, ηis given by
ηϑ=Ξ2
∆θ|θ=ϑ(ξcscϑ−asinϑ)2. (27)
The motions of photons on the plane are governed by the eﬀectiv e potential
V1=V|η=ηϑ,or Ve1=Ve|η=ηϑ. (28)
Let us take the parameters a= 0.5,Q= 0.2,bc= 0.01,αq= 0.01,ωq=−0.35,ξ= 8.4,
and Λ = 1 .02×10−26. Here, such a cosmological constant is a scaled value, label ed as Λ sca.
It corresponds to a realistic value of the astrophysical sce nario Λ rea=c4/(M2G2). If the
black hole mass Mis the Sun’s mass M⊙, we have the realistic value Λ 0=c4/(M2
⊙G2) =
R0−2= (M⊙G/c2)−2= (1.475km)−2= 4.597×10−7m−2. For the supermassive black hole
candidate with mass M= 6.5×109M⊙in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87, we
have Λ rea= (M⊙/M)2Λ0= 1.088×10−26m−2. Thus, Λ sca= 1.02×10−26M−2corresponds
to the realistic cosmological constant Λ rea= 1.11×10−52m−2, which was obtained from the
Planck data [44,45]. For simplicity, the subscripts such as scaare dropped in the scaled
quantities like Λ sca.
Fig. 2 plots the relation between the radial distance rand the eﬀective potential V1orVe1
on the equatorial plane ϑ=π/2 in several combinations of the parameters. When ξ < ξcp,
the photon will fall into the black hole; but the photon will s catter to inﬁnity when ξ > ξcp.
Whenξ=ξcp, the photon will wind many times on a circular orbit. The circ ular orbit
corresponds to the top point (i.e., the local maximum) of the eﬀective potential V1orVe1. It
is clear that the circular photon orbit satisﬁes the conditi ons
V1= 1,dV1
dr= 0;or Ve1= 1,dVe1
dr= 0. (29)
The circular photon orbit is unstable because
d2V1
dr2<0,ord2Ve1
dr2<0. (30)
The conditions (29) and (30) for the unstable circular photo n orbit are equivalent to the
following conditions [29]
R(r) = 0,dR(r)
dr= 0, (31)
d2R(r)
dr2>0. (32)
The circular orbital radius rcpincreases as any one of the parameters bc,αqand|ωq|increases
in Fig. 2.
In fact,ξcpandrcpare determined by Eq. (29) or (31) when another impact parame terη
is given according to Eq. (27). Based on Eq. (31), ξcpandηcpcan be expressed in terms of
rcpas
ξcp=a+rcp

(a/ne}ationslash= 0), (33)
ηcp= 16Ξ2r2

7where ∆′
r=d∆r/dr. Because of Eq. (27), ξcpandηcpalso satisfy the relation
ηcp=Ξ2
∆θ|θ=ϑ(ξcpcscϑ−asinϑ)2, (35)
equivalently,
ξcp= sinϑ/parenleftBigg
asinϑ±/radicalbig
ηcp∆θ
Ξ/parenrightBigg
. (36)
Thus,rcpcan be solved from Eqs. (33), (34) and (36) for a given value ϑ. Then,ξcpandηcp
are determined through Eqs. (33) and (34).
In terms of Eqs. (33)-(35), the radii of circular photon orbi ts on the equatorial plane for
the Kerr black hole are expressed as
r∓
cp= 2/parenleftbigg
1+cos/parenleftbigg2
3arccos(∓a)/parenrightbigg/parenrightbigg
, (37)
where the upper sign “ −” correspond to prograde orbits and the lower sign “+” to retr ograde
orbits. Then, ξcpandηcpfor the circular photon orbits on the equatorial plane can be given
by Eqs. (33) and (34). When the Kerr black hole is surrounded b y the extra sources, we
have no way to provide an explicit expression of rcp. Eqs. (33), (34) and (36) must be solved
through an iterative method, such as the Newtonian iterativ e method. In fact, rcpshould be
solved iteratively, and has two roots r+
cpandr−
cpwithr+

cpfor any angle ϑin the interval
0< ϑ < π.
Ifa= 0, the spacetime (1) is spherically symmetric and ξcpcannot be given by Eq. (33)
but can be given by Eq. (36). It is expressed as
ξcp=±sinϑ√ηcp. (38)
In this case, we use Eq. (31) to obtain
4∆r=rcp∆′
r. (39)
For the Schwarzschild black hole, Eq. (39) has the solution rcp= 3, which corresponds to
the radius of circular photon orbit in the Schwarzschild spa cetime. Noting Eq. (34), we have
ηcp= 27. Hence, ξcp=±3√
3 on the equatorial plane is obtained from Eq. (38). For the
non-Schwarzschild case, the solution rcpof Eq. (39) is solved by the Newtonian iterative
method. Then, ηcpis given by Eq. (34), and ξcpis obtained from Eq. (38). It is clear that
when the parameters bc,Q, Λ,αqandωqare given, rcpandηcpare also determined. However,
ξcpis varied with a variation of ϑ. Particular for ϑ=π/2,ξcphas the maximum ξmax
cp=√ηcp.
Clearly, the path of the obtainment of rcp,ξcpandηcpfor the rotating case is somewhat
unlike that for the nonrotating case. It is easier to obtain t he solutions of rcp,ξcpandηcpfor
the nonrotating case than those for the rotating case.
2.3.2 Spherical photon orbits
As is demonstrated above, the eﬀective potential (28) govern s the radial motion of photons
on the two-dimensional plane. If Θ is not always identical to zero for any time λ, thenθ
varies in the range 0 < θ < π with time λin Eq. (25). Note that ηsatisfying Eq. (25), i.e.
θ=ϑas a solution of Θ( θ) = 0, is possible at some time, but is impossible at any other t imes.
Without loss of generality, θsatisfying the condition Θ( θ)≥0 is arbitrarily given in the range
0< θ < π. In this case, the motion of photons is not lying on the two-di mensional plane but
8is lying in the three-dimensional space. Eq. (23) or (26) is s till the eﬀective potential in the
three-dimensional space, labeled as V2orVe2. The top point of the eﬀective potential V2or
Ve2in Fig. 2(b) corresponds to a spherical photon orbit. The con ditions for the existence of
spherical photon orbit are still the same as Eqs. (29) and (30 ) (or Eqs. (31) and (32)) for
the existence of circular photon orbit. An explicit diﬀerenc e between the spherical photon
orbit and the circular photon orbit is that Eq. (27) is not sat isﬁed for the spherical photon
orbit, whereas it is for the circular photon orbit. The two im pact parameters ξspandηspfor
the spherical photon orbit are consistent with the expressi ons ofξcpandηcpfor the circular
photon orbit in Eqs. (33) and (34), but do not satisfy Eq. (36) . The values of ξcpare based
ona/ne}ationslash= 0. Ifa= 0, then the spacetime (1) is spherically symmetric, and the above-mentioned
circular photon orbits are present. ξcpis given in Eq. (38) rather than Eq. (33).
Using Eq. (32), we can know that for the case of a/ne}ationslash= 0,rspis constrained in the range

Note that ϑmay not be π/2. As the spherical radius rspranges from r−

number of points ( ξsp,ηsp) are obtained from Eqs. (33) and (34).
3 Parameter constraints based on black hole shad-
ows
A black hole shadow is observed by an observer in a zero angula r moment observer (ZAMO)
reference frame [5]. Then a local curvature radius for the bo undary of black hole shadow is
discussed. Finally, the constraint of curvature radius is u sed to constrain the parameters.
3.1 Black hole shadows
The above-mentioned points ( ξsp,ηsp) from the spherical photon orbits are used to study the
black hole shadows.
In order to obtain an image of the black hole, we introduce cel estial coordinates in an
observer’s sky. Assume that the static observer locally sta ys at point ( r0,θ0) in the ZAMO
reference frame, where the observer can determine the image points. The observer basis
{ˆet,ˆer,ˆeθ,ˆeφ}can be expressed in terms of the coordinate basis {∂t,∂r,∂θ,∂φ}as [46-48]
ˆe(µ)= ˆeν
(µ)∂ν, (40)
where ˆeν
(µ)is a transform matrix satisfying the relation gµνeµ
αeν
β=ηαβwithηαβbeing the
Minkowski metric. In general, it is convenient to choose the observer located in the frame

ˆe(r)=1√grr∂r, (42)
ˆe(θ)=1√gθθ∂θ, (43)
ˆe(φ)=1√gφφ∂φ, (44)
Since ˆe(t)·∂φ= 0, the observer in this local rest frame has zero angular mom entum at inﬁnity.
In this sense, the frame is called the ZAMO reference frame, r epresenting the zero angular
momentum observer.
9The four-momentum pµof a photon by its projection onto ˆ eµis locally measured by
p(t)=−pµˆeµ
(t), (45)
p(i)=pµˆeµ
(i)(i=r,θ,φ). (46)
On the basis of Eqs. (41-44), the four-momentum pµcan be rewritten as
p(t)=ζE−γL, (47)
p(r)=1√grrpr, (48)
p(θ)=1√gθθpθ, (49)
p(φ)=1
√gφφpφ, (50)
whereζ= ˆet
(t)andγ= ˆeφ
(t).
Supposethat theobserver has aradial distance r0inFig. 3. Theinclination angle between
the symmetrical axis of the black hole and the direction to th e observer is θ0. The 3-vector /vector p
is the photon’s linear momentum with three components p(r),p(θ)andp(φ)in the orthonormal
basis{ˆet,ˆer,ˆeθ,ˆeφ}[46-48]:
/vector p=p(r)ˆer+p(θ)ˆeθ+p(φ)ˆeφ. (51)
Notethat( p(t))2=p2= (p(r))2+(p(θ))2+(p(φ))2. Theobservationangles( α,β)areintroduced
by
p(r)=|/vector p|cosαcosβ, (52)
p(θ)=|/vector p|sinα, (53)
p(φ)=|/vector p|cosαsinβ. (54)

Obviously, the black hole shadow is a standard circle with th e radiusRsh. The Schwarzschild
black hole shadow has its radius Rsh= 3√
3. The shadow size is independent of the an-
glesϑandθ0. The result is still present when the extra sources such as th e quintessence,
cloud strings, cosmological constant and black hole charge are included in the Schwarzschild
spacetime. This is because rcpis given by Eq. (39) that does not depend on the angles ϑ
andθ0, andηcpis obtained from Eq. (34) that does not contain the angles ϑandθ0. In
fact,rcpdepends on the parameters bc,αq,ωqand Λ.ηporRshis also determined by these
parameters. Table 1 lists the values of rcpandRshfor several diﬀerent combinations of the
parameters. The radius of circular photon orbit increases a s each of the parameters bc,αq
and|ωq|increases. However, a variation of Λ does not aﬀect the radius of circular photon
orbit because rcpin Eq. (39) is independent of Λ. The shadow Rshincreases as either the
parameter bcorωqincreases. This result is due to the increase of the black hol e gravitational
ﬁeld. On the contrary, as the parameters αqand Λ increase, the gravitational ﬁeld of the
black hole is weakened, and the size of the black hole shadow d ecreases.
For the rotating case a/ne}ationslash= 0, the celestial coordinates ( x,y) are obtained unlike those for
the nonrotating case. If the observer stays at the equatoria l planeθ0=π/2, the celestial
coordinates have the relation

Notice that ηpin Eq. (62) is unlike that in Eq. (61). ηpin Eq. (61) is dependent on the
radius of spherical photon orbits (i.e. the radius of circul ar photon orbits) and has only one
invariant value. Therefore, the shadow for the nonrotating black hole is a standard circle.
However, thereare two photon circular orbits on a planeinEq . (62), andtheradii of spherical
photon orbits are arbitrarily given between the two radii of circular photon orbits. That is,
ηpin Eq. (62) is varied. In this situation, Eq. (62) cannot be th ought of as a circle for the
rotating black hole.
For the Kerr spacetime, the radii of photon circular orbits o n the equatorial plane are

obtained. If the observer is not located on the equatorial pl ane (i.e. θ0/ne}ationslash=π/2), we can still
use this method but have to discard imaginary points during t he calculations. When θ0is
consistent with ϑ, the celestial coordinates are no longer determined by the s pherical photon
orbits, whose radii are given in the range ( r−
cp,r+

by the spherical photon orbits, whose radii are arbitrarily given in the range ( r−

are termed critical circular photon orbits. The method for c alculating rDandrRis termed
Method 1. Another path for the obtainment of rDandrRis to solve the equation y(rcp) = 0,
wherercpcorresponds to the radii of unstable circular photon orbits on the planes θ0. In fact,
the celestial coordinate yis identical to zero for the critical circular photon orbits whenηcp
in Eq. (35) is substituted into Eq. (55). This fact is why the r adii of circular photon orbits
11are obtained by solving the equation y(rcp) = 0. The method for calculating rDandrRis
termed Method 2. Fig. 4 (a)-(d) shows that the two methods giv e the relations between the
critical circular orbital radii and θ0for two spin cases in the Kerr spacetime. Method 1 (Fig.
4 (a) and (c) in the left-hand side) and Method 2 (Fig. 4 (b) and (d) in the right-hand side)
give the same numerical results to the critical circular orb ital radii rDandrRon the planes
ϑ=θ0. This result is also suitable for various observational ang lesθ0, as shown in Table 2.
When the spin ais given, rDandrRdecrease with the observational angle θ0increasing from
0 toπ/2. When the observational angle θ0is given, rDandrRfor the slower spin a= 0.5
are larger than those for the higher spin a= 0.9. It is also shown via Table 2 that rDand
rRare symmetric with respect to θ0=π/2. Due to rD=rRforθ0= 0,π, the shadows are
circular in this case. When the additional sources Q= 0.2,bc= 0.01,αq= 0.01,ωq=−0.35
and Λ = 1 .02×10−26are included in Fig. 4(c), Method 1 (Fig. 4(e) in the left-han d side)
and Method 2 (Fig. 4(f) in the right-hand side) also give the s ame numerical results to rD
andrRin the KNdS spacetime. The additional sources slightly aﬀect rDandrRin the KNdS
spacetime, as compared with those in the Kerr case. For a give n observational angle θ0in
Table 2, rDandrRin the former case are slightly larger than or approximately equal to those
in the latter one. The points ( xD,0) and (xR,0) of the Kerr black hole shadow are plotted
in Fig. 5, and they are determined by the prograde and retrogr ade photon orbits in the
planeϑ=θ0. In practice, the black hole shadow is made of the two points a nd other points
associated with unstable spherical photon orbits between t he radii of two circular photon
orbits in the plane ϑ=θ0.
The above demonstrations introduce the two methods for comp uting the Kerr black hole
shadows. These methods are still suitable for the computati on of black hole shadows when
the quintessence, cloud strings, cosmological constant an d black hole charge are included in
the Kerr spacetime.
3.2 Local curvature radius
The boundary of a black hole shadow can describe some propert ies of the black hole. It is a
one-dimensional closed curve in the celestial coordinates . From the viewpoint of diﬀerential
geometry, the curve has its length and local curvature radiu s. The curvature radius is written
in Ref. [57] as
ℜ=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(x′(rp)2+y′(rp)2)(3/2)
x′(rp)y′′(rp)−x′′(rp)y′(rp)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. (63)
Utilizing the symmetry of black hole shadow, the authors of [ 54] discussed several char-
acteristic points along the boundary curve of the Kerr black hole shadow in Fig. 5. These
points are D,R,BandT. The Kerr black hole parameters can be constrained in terms o f
the characteristic points and curvature radius. The points TandBare determined by
dy
drp= 0. (64)
The points DandRare governed by
y= 0. (65)
Since the shadow curve has the Z2 symmetry, the vertical diameter ∆ yof the shadow is
∆y= 2yT. (66)
12The horizontal diameter is given by
∆x=|xD−xR|. (67)
Similar to the Kerr black hole shadow, the KNdS black hole sha dows can also be consid-
ered. Figs. 6-9plottheKNdSblackholeshadowsfordiﬀerentc ombinationsoftheparameters.
When the black hole spin a= 0.98 is high in Fig. 6, the black hole shadows are not circles but
look like “D”. The shadows increase with the parameters bcandωqincreasing, but decrease
with the parameters αqand Λ increasing. When the black hole spin a= 0.5 is moderate in
Fig. 7, the black hole shadows are approximately circles. Th e eﬀects of the parameters on
the shadows in this case are similar to those in the high spin c ase. When the black hole spin
a= 0.1 is low in Fig. 8, the black hole shadows are more circular. Th e eﬀects of the param-
eters on the shadows in the low spin case are similar to those i n the high or moderate spin
case. Fig. 9 describes the black hole shadows in four spaceti mes involving the Kerr, Kerr-de
Sitter (KdS), KNdS (with bc=αq= 0) and KNdS (with bc/ne}ationslash= 0 and αq/ne}ationslash= 0) spacetimes for
three spins a= 0.5,0.8,0.94. The three spins are considered because the related const raints
are suitable for the black hole spin values of afrom 0.5 to 0.94 [26]. These results show that
the black hole shadows seem to be circles whether the spin is s mall or large. When the spin is
given, the three black hole shadows in Fig. 9 (a)-(c) and Tabl e 6 are indistinguishable. The
result is consistent with that of [28] about the relation bet ween the KdS black hole shadow
and the Kerr black hole shadow in the case of Λ = 1 .02×10−26. In addition, the black hole
shadows decrease when the spins increase. Here the observat ion angle is θ0= 17◦, which is
the angle between the approaching jet from the central radio source in M87* and the line of
sight [49]. Because a highly charged dilaton black hole is ru led out by the measurements of
the EHT [6], smaller values are given to the black hole charge s in our work. The black hole
shadow is more circular for the large spin in Fig. 9 than that f or the large spin in Fig. 6.
It is because the observation angle θ0= 17◦in Fig. 9 is smaller than the observation angle
θ0= 90◦in Fig. 6. Although the observation angle θ0= 90◦is still larger in Fig. 8, the spin
a= 0.1 is so smaller that the black hole shadow is close to a circle.
More details on the characteristics of the black hole shadow s in Figs. 6-9 are listed in
Tables 3-6. Here the curvature radii at the points T,DandR, which respectively correspond
toℜT,ℜDandℜR, are computed by the gravitational radius. The gravitation al radius from
the EHT observations [2,25] is expressed as
θg=GM
c2l≈3.8µas, (68)
wherelis the distance from the observer to the black hole, i.e. l=r0. For the larger
observation angle in Tables 3-5, ℜT,ℜDandℜRhave typical diﬀerences for the high spins,
but small diﬀerences for the low spins. The shadow size increa ses as either the parameter bc
orωqincreases. This result is due to the increase of the black hol e gravitational ﬁeld. On the
contrary, the gravitational ﬁeld of the black hole is weaken ed and the size of the black hole
shadow decreases as the parameters αqand Λ increase. For the smaller observation angle in
Table 6, the curvature radii at the characteristic points ℜT,ℜDandℜRhave small changes
with the increases or decreases of these parameters even if t he spin is large. Consequently,
the shadows remain nearly circular.
3.3 Constraints of the parameters
Based on the EHT observations of M87*, the radius of the shado w is constrained in the range
4.31M≤rsh,A≤6.08M. (69)
13Equivalently, the constraint to the curvature radius was gi ven in [27-28] by
4.31M≤ ℜ ≤6.08M. (70)
The curvature radius may have a maximum value and a minimum va lue. It has two local
maximum values at rp=rDandrp=rR. The local maximum at rp=rDis larger than that
atrp=rR. Hence we have ℜmax=ℜ(rD). The minimum curvature radius ℜmin=ℜ(rT)
corresponds to the well of these curves. Moreover, ℜminandℜmaxgive lower and upper
bounds to the size of the shadow. In other words, ℜminshould not decrease below 4.31M and
ℜmaxshould not increase beyond 6.08M.
Finally, we utilize the constraint of the curvature radius t o restrict the parameters. The
allowed region of the cloud strings bcin Fig. 10(a) is down the red curve corresponding to the
maximum curvature radius ℜmaxwhen the black hole spin aranges from 0 to 1 and the other
parameters are given. Similarly, the allowed region of the q uintessence parameter αqin Fig.
10(b) and the cosmological constant Λ in Fig. 10(d) is down th e blue curve corresponding to
the minimum curvature radius ℜminwhen the black hole spin aranges from 0 to 1 and the
other parameters are given. However, the allowed region of t he quintessential state parameter
ωqin Fig. 10(c) is the upper region of the blue curve. For any spi na∈[0,1], the allowed
regions of the parameters are 0 ≤bc<0.15 in Fig. 10(a), 0 ≤αq<0.18 in Fig. 10(b),
−0.376< ωq<−1/3 in Fig. 10(c), and 0 ≤Λ<5×10−21in Fig. 10(d).
4 Conclusions
In this paper, we focus on the motion of photons around the KNd S black hole surrounded by
quintessence and a cloud of strings.
Due to the existence of the Carter constant, unstable circul ar photon orbits on a two-
dimensional plane not limited to the equatorial plane and un stable spherical photon orbits
in the three-dimensional space can be present. The conditio ns for the existence of circular
photon orbits are basically consistent with those for the ex istence of spherical photon orbits.
However, only one diﬀerence between them is only that the angl eθalways remains invariant
for the circular photon orbits and is varied with time for the spherical photon orbits. The two
impact parameters can be determined by these circular photo n orbits and spherical photon
orbits. The radius of circular photon orbit increases as eac h of the parameters involving
the cloud of strings bc, quintessence parameter αq, and quintessential state parameter |ωq|
increases. However, a small variation of the cosmological c onstant Λ does not typically aﬀect
the circular photon orbit radius.
For the nonrotating case with the spherical symmetry, the bl ack hole shadows are circular
and their sizes are independent of the observation angles an d the planes on which circular
photon orbits exist. For the rotating case with the axialsym metry, the black hole shadow is
dependent on the observation angle and the black hole spin pa rameter. In both cases, small
changes of the parameters excluding the spin parameter and t he observation angle exert
similar inﬂuences on the sizes of black hole shadows. That is , the black hole shadows increase
with the cloud of strings and negative quintessential state parameter increasing, whereas
decrease with the quintessence parameter and cosmological constant increasing. The black
hole shadows also decrease as the black hole spins get larger . When the observation angle in
the range of 0 and π/2 is large, the black hole shadow looks like the D shape for a hi gh spin,
but is close to a circle for a low spin. When the observation an gle is small, the black hole
shadow seems to be a circle regardless of the high or low spin c ase.
Based on the EHT observations of M87*, the constraint of the c urvature radius is used to
constrain the parameters. For any spin a∈[0,1], the allowed regions of the parameters are
140≤bc<0.15, 0≤αq<0.18,−0.376< ωq<−1/3, and 0 ≤Λ<5×10−21.

Figure 2: Eﬀective potentials for the motion of photons on th e equatorial plane ϑ=π/2 around the black holes in several combinations
of the parameters. The parameters in these panels are a= 0.5,Q= 0.2, Λ = 1 .2×10−26andθ0=π/2. (a)-(c): αq= 0.01 and
ωq=−0.35, but three diﬀerent values are given to bc. (d)-(f): bc= 0.01 andωq=−0.35, but three diﬀerent values are given to αq.
(g)-(i):bc= 0.01 andαq= 0.1, but three diﬀerent values are given to ωq. The maximum values correspond to unstable circular photon
orbits. The circular orbital radius rcpincreases with each of the parameters bc,αqand|ωq|increasing. The eﬀects of the parameters
on the eﬀective potentials of spherical orbits are the same a s those on the circular orbits. The cosmological constant ha s little inﬂuence
on them.
