A key advantage of utilizing van der Waals materials as defect-hosting platforms for quantum
applications is the controllable proximity of the defect to the surface or the substrate for improved
light extraction, enhanced coupling with photonic elements, or more sensitive metrology. However,
this aspect results in a signiÔ¨Åcant challenge for defect identiÔ¨Åcation and characterization, as the
defect‚Äôs optoelectronic properties depend on the speciÔ¨Åcs of the atomic environment. Here we
explore the mechanisms by which the environment can inÔ¨Çuence the properties of carbon impurity
centres in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We compare the optical and electronic properties of such
defects between bulk-like and few-layer Ô¨Ålms, showing alteration of the zero-phonon line energies,
modiÔ¨Åcations to their phonon sidebands, and enhancements of their inhomogeneous broadenings.
Todisentanglethevariousmechanismsresponsibleforthesechanges, includingtheatomicstructure,
electronic wavefunctions, and dielectric screening environment of the defect center, we combine ab-
initiocalculations based on a density-functional theory with a quantum embedding approach. By
studying a variety of carbon-based defects embedded in monolayer and bulk hBN, we demonstrate
that the dominant eÔ¨Äect of the change in the environment is the screening of the density-density
Coulomb interactions within and between the defect orbitals. Our comparative analysis of the
experimental and theoretical Ô¨Åndings paves the way for improved identiÔ¨Åcation of defects in low-
dimensional materials and the development of atomic scale sensors of dielectric environments.
I. INTRODUCTION
Point defects in semiconductors and insulators have emerged as robust and manipulatable
quantum systems for applications such as qubits for quantum computers [1‚Äì4], single-photon
emitters (SPEs) for quantum communication [5, 6], and nanoprobes for quantum metrology
[7]. In this context, two-dimensional van der Waals (2DvdW) bonded compounds have been
proposed as promising host materials. One key beneÔ¨Åt arises from the potentially atomically
perfect surfaces of these materials. Quantum defects may reside in close proximity to the
surface without suÔ¨Äering instabilities in their optoelectronic and/or coherence properties due
tosurfacedanglingbonds, adsorbates, orlocalchargevariations. Thishasseveraladvantages

2for creating sensors of local Ô¨Åelds at the nanoscale, better extraction eÔ¨Éciency for defect
SPEs, and direct imaging or manipulating defects by scanning probe techniques [8, 9]. The
most developed of such host material is hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)[10, 11]. It is widely
available [12] and its large band gap is conducive to the formation of deep quantum levels.
There have been many reports indicating hBN hosts SPEs [13‚Äì16] with some allowing for
spinmanipulationswithinthenegativelychargedboronvacancydefects[17‚Äì19]. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,
it has been shown experimentally [20, 21] and theoretically [22‚Äì25] that carbon impurities in
hBN can give rise to a plethora of defect centres with a wide variety of properties attractive
for quantum applications.
The existence of defects in proximity to surfaces and interfaces also presents a signiÔ¨Åcant
challenge. Quantum technologies often require arrays of defects with identical properties
and though the surfaces and interfaces of the substrate can be atomically clean, proximity
to them may change the properties of the defect, including emission energies and linewidths
[26]. For example, hBN Ô¨Ålms are usually multilayer and range from tens of nanometers to a
few atomic layers. Even a defect with the same chemical composition may exhibit diÔ¨Äerent
experimental signatures depending on its position with respect to the interface, surface,
or edge of the Ô¨Ålm. A quantitative understanding of these eÔ¨Äects is necessary for defect
identiÔ¨Åcation and quantum applications.
In order to understand the inÔ¨Çuence of surfaces and interfaces on the properties of defects in
hBN and other 2DvdW materials, several eÔ¨Äects must be disentangled. First, the diÔ¨Äerent
distances to surrounding atoms or vacant spaces may change the structure of the defect,
especially if it involves displacements of atoms out of the 2D plane. Such structural modiÔ¨Å-
cations will also impact the electron-lattice coupling responsible for the phonon broadening
of optical transitions. The electronic wavefunctions associated with the defect states may
also evolve according to the variations in symmetry and environment. Additionally, the
alteration of the dielectric screening environment experienced by the defect will modify the
Coulomb interactions between electrons occupying the defect levels. The latter has been
recognized before as an important contribution to correlation eÔ¨Äects in layered materials,
such as for exciton formation [27‚Äì29] and magnetism [30]. The relative importance of all
of these factors is expected to diÔ¨Äer between defects with diÔ¨Äerent atomic and electronic
structures of the ground and excited states.
In this work, we use a combination of experimental characterization, via optical and scan-
3ning probe spectroscopy, and Ô¨Årst-principle theoretical analysis to elucidate the inÔ¨Çuence
of the environment of the defects in 2DvdW materials on their properties. We inspect
the environmental sensitivity of the carbon impurity and native defect centres in hBN, as
intentional carbon doping allows us to create reproducible defect centres with stable photo-
luminescence (PL) resonances. Thus, we can control the defect density and the proximity
of the defects to the surface by isolating Ô¨Ålms of varied thicknesses. We demonstrate the
evolution of the optical spectra from ensembles of speciÔ¨Åc defect types in 50nm thick
hBN Ô¨Ålms to individual defects in 10atomic layers of hBN. We interpret the modiÔ¨Åcation
of the PL spectra based on a combination of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations
and a recently-developed quantum embedding approach [31], supported further by scanning
tunneling spectra (STS). We apply the theoretical approaches to defects in monolayer and
bulk hBN, which allows us to disentangle the various eÔ¨Äects on defect properties arising
from the surrounding environment.
We Ô¨Ånd that the dominant eÔ¨Äect of the environment is the change in dielectric screening,
which aÔ¨Äects the intra- and interorbital density-density Coulomb interaction between elec-
trons in defect states. The enhanced screening in bulk form of the crystal signiÔ¨Åcantly
reduces the energy of intradefect optical transitions if they depend on such interactions. In
addition, we propose that this sensitivity to the dielectric environment can be utilized as a
sensor for local dielectric constants when brought into contact with surfaces, adsorbates, or
liquids. We highlight that the optical transitions of the defects based on the substitutional
carbon dimer have the potential for such applications.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe our experimental optical and
scanning-probe measurements, which motivate the systematic theoretical study of environ-
mental eÔ¨Äects on defects given in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we discuss the main results and the
implications for defect identiÔ¨Åcation/characterization, as well as the use of defects to detect
changes in a dielectric environment.
II. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION OF CARBON-ENRICHED hBN
In this study, we characterise ultra-pure hBN crystals grown via high-pressure-temperature
gradient methods. Carbon doping is achieved post-growth by annealing the crystals in a
graphite furnace at 2000C for one hour, which gives rise to multiple optically active defect
4centres [20]. Details on the growth and sample fabrication are given in the Methods Section.
The overall goal of our experimental characterization of these samples is twofold. Firstly,
we aim to determine the general properties of the defects that are present to motivate the
choices of defects for our theoretical study. Secondly, we aim to inspect how the environment
changes the experimental signatures of these defects.
A. Scanning probe measurements
To address the Ô¨Årst objective, we perform scanning-tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy
(STM/STS) measurements on a three-layer-thick sample. We can correlate defects observed
directly via STM with features of the electronic structure via STS that we expect to see in
our theoretical calculations. This allows us to get an overview of the properties of relevant
defects in our samples, which is important for the next theoretical steps, as there is a huge
variety of carbon-related defects that may occur in hBN [22‚Äì25]. We present some represen-
tative cases in Fig. 1. The STM data (panels on the right) demonstrates well-isolated defect
centres that appear as symmetric or asymmetric features in the colour maps. In the dI=dV
STS spectra we see that several of these defects (labelled #1 to #3), involve resonances
near the hBN conduction or valence bands, consistent with simple defects, such as carbon
substitutions for boron or nitrogen vacancies [32, 33]. Accordingly, we start with simple
defects in our theoretical modelling discussed in Sec. III.
B. Photoluminescence spectroscopy
We now analyze the optical PL response of carbon-doped hBN in the visible and near-
infrared spectral range. We study the eÔ¨Äect of the defect environment by considering two
samples. The Ô¨Årst is bulk-like, characterized by a thickness of about 50 nm. Here, the
defects are more likely embedded within the bulk of hBN rather than being localized at the
surface or the interface with the SiO 2substrate. The second sample is about 10 hBN layers
in thickness, such that on average the defects are in closer vicinity to the surface/interface.
In all cases, optical and scanning probe measurements were conducted far from the edges of
the samples.
We Ô¨Årst focus on defect centres in the bulk-like hBN:C Ô¨Ålms. In Fig. 2(a) we show the PL

Ô¨Ålm, which were initially identiÔ¨Åed through scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). The STM
images are presented next to the corresponding STS curves. All experiments were performed at
the temperature T= 77K, except for the defect #4, which was inspected at T= 4:7K. STM
images of defects #1  #3 were measured under the conditions Vs= 5V,It= 30pA. For defect
#4, STM image was obtained under the conditions Vs= 4:5V,It= 100pA. The STS #0 was
measured on a pristine hBN area free of defects. The inset constitutes the magniÔ¨Åed image of the
STS curve of defect #4, which demonstrates the Ô¨Åne structure of the vibrionic response arising due
to the electron-phonon coupling. The scale bar in the STM images corresponds to 2 nm.

which we attribute to speciÔ¨Åc defect centres active in near-infrared (A1 and A2) and visible (A3
and A4) spectral regions. The spectra of the speciÔ¨Åc defects (b-e) are normalized towards uniform
maximum intensity for ease of comparison. A comparative representation of PL spectra of hBN:C
in the bulk limit ( 50 nm thick) and a few layers‚Äô limit (about 10 layers) is presented for defects A3
(f) and A4 (g). The second-order photon correlations g(2)()measurements done for the emission

spectrum together with a comparative analysis of the four most pronounced defect centres
given in Fig. 2(b-e). Defect A1 displays emission in form of a broad asymmetric band
indicative of strong electron-phonon coupling. The emission spectra of defects A2 and A4
are dominated by narrow resonances characteristic of centres exhibiting atomic character
[20]. Defect A3 displays a spectrum typically observed for more complex defect structures
such as nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, where the well-pronounced dominant zero-
phonon line (ZPL) is accompanied by lower-energy phonon sidebands [20].
We can characterize the luminescence signatures of the bulk hBN defect centres in the frame-
work of a simple one-dimensional Franck-Condon model [34]. In that model, the lineshape
is governed by the coupling of the electronic transition to a single eÔ¨Äective vibrational mode
and is parameterized by the Huang-Rhys factor SHR, which gives the average number of
phonons emitted in an optical transition. SHRdepends on the diÔ¨Äerence in atomic structure
between the electronic states involved in the transition, and the curvature of the potential
energy surface for each state with respect to displacements of the eÔ¨Äective vibrational mode.
Experimentally, SHRcan be determined from the ratio of the spectrally integrated intensity

of the ZPL and the intensity of the total defect emission (i.e., the Debeye-Waller factor
w=IZPL=Itotal) using the phenomenological relation SHR= ln(w). In Table I we present
wandSHRfor the defects in bulk-like hBN. We see that they are characterized by small to
medium strength of the electron-phonon coupling. For A1, the value of SHRshould be taken
as a lower bound since the ZPL is not discernible. Similarly, the phonon sideband for A4 is
not distinctive, and thus we report SHRnear zero.
Since these defect centres yield reproducible and well-recognizable spectral characteristics,
we can directly compare defects in the bulk-like and few-layer samples. In Fig. 2(f,g) we
show the corresponding PL spectra for energies around A3 and A4 in bulk and 10-layer thick
hBN:C Ô¨Ålms. Importantly, we Ô¨Ånd for both hBN thicknesses PL resonances at similar but
not identical emission energies. In the A3 energy range, we see that the ZPL blueshifts by
about 50 meV from the bulk to the 10-layer sample, which is accompanied by a reduction of
theZPLlinewidth(reductionof IZPL)indicativeoftheremovalofinhomogeneousbroadening
and by an increasing Huang-Rhys factor SHRfrom 2.1 to 3.2. As the phonon sideband is
not drastically aÔ¨Äected, we attribute the enhanced SHRto the reduced inhomogeneous ZPL
broadening.
The two-peak structure of A4 is visible for both hBN thicknesses and shows a linewidth
reduction, without clear signs of a blueshift and the same value of SHR'0. For both
defect types, in the few-layer sample, we conÔ¨Årm that we are probing individual defects [15,
35, 36] by measuring the antibunching in the second order correlation function g(2)()[see
Fig. 2(h,i)].
These optical measurements explicitly reveal the signiÔ¨Åcant changes in defect properties,
but the particulars vary from defect to defect. This observation provides the motivation for
our theoretical investigation of environmental eÔ¨Äects on diÔ¨Äerent defects in the next section.
Since the attribution of such optical signals with speciÔ¨Åc defects is still controversial, we will
8discuss general defects that are likely to exist in hBN:C samples [22‚Äì25], and provide further
commentary on how our results could be used to aid defect identiÔ¨Åcation in Sec. IV.

diÔ¨Äerence in the screening environment. Note in (c) that the impurity positions are diÔ¨Äerent.
We proceed by analyzing how the defect structure and the dielectric environment of the
hBN host material control intradefect excitations and the Huang-Rhys factors of these ex-
citations. We consider a variety of charge-neutral native and C-containing defects in three
diÔ¨Äerent structures: bulk ( P63=mmc), constrained monolayer, and free-standing monolayer
hBN, as depicted in Fig. 3. The bulk and monolayer structures are fully relaxed, while the
constrained monolayer structure corresponds to the impurity embedded in a monolayer but
with the same structure as in bulk. With these three structures, we are able to theoretically
disentangle the eÔ¨Äects of screening and relaxations going from bulk to monolayer hBN. We
note that well-controlled impurities in free-standing monolayer hBN are diÔ¨Écult to realize
in realistic samples, nevertheless, it serves as a theoretical limit of the strongest environ-
mental sensitivity of defect centres. We combine Ô¨Årst-principles DFT calculations with the
quantum embedding scheme described in Ref. 31, which allows us to systematically study
how changes in the environment and modiÔ¨Åcations in the impurity structure in the ground
and excited states aÔ¨Äect the impurity properties.
9A. Computational approach
The eÔ¨Äect of the environment on the atomic relaxations around the defect is treated at the
DFT level and constrained DFT calculations are used to relax the defect structure in excited
electronic states. We furthermore estimate how the electron-phonon coupling associated
with defect transitions is aÔ¨Äected by evaluating the Huang-Rhys factor SHR, introduced in
Sec. IIB. A full picture of the vibrational coupling requires determining SHRfor all relevant
modes in the system, which is a challenging task for transitions with moderate SHR3
as the defects observed in PL [37, 38]; however, often a qualitative picture of the strength
of the electron-phonon coupling can be obtained by considering a single eÔ¨Äective mode
corresponding to the structural diÔ¨Äerence between the ground and excited electronic states
[39, 40]. Under this assumption, and presuming the vibrational coupling is equal in the
excited and ground state, SHR=EFC=~!, whereEFC= (Eabs Eem)=2is the Frank-Condon
relaxation energy (half of the diÔ¨Äerence between vertical absorption and emission energies),
and!is the frequency of the mode [34, 39, 41]. In addition, if we assume that the mode is
harmonic, we can write SHR=Q

EFC
2, where Qis the absolute change of the nuclear
coordinate between the ground and excited defect state indicative of the renormalization of
the inter-atomic bond strength.
The electronic eÔ¨Äects of the environment will be elucidated using an embedding approach
within which we map the complicated many-electron problem of the defect in hBN to an

results in many-body energies and wavefunctions of intradefect excitations.
The ‚Äúactive space‚Äù of defect-related states is isolated from the host hBN electronic structure
10via the construction of Wannier functions, which allows us to determine the hopping matrix
elementstij. Changes in the hopping matrix elements reÔ¨Çect changes in the properties of the
defect states on the DFT level. The screened Coulomb matrix elements Uijklare computed
in the static constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) [42] level, which takes the
environmental screening into account. Comparing the unscreened (bare) Coulomb matrix

For computational details, see the Sec. V.
We can also obtain EFCfrom the intradefect transitions calculated from the many-body en-
ergies of Eq. (1). The procedure that makes this possible is to calculate the transition energy
in both the ground state geometry and the excited state geometry. Under the assumptions
discussed above, half of their diÔ¨Äerence gives EFC.
B. Single carbon impurities
We start our theoretical discussion with single carbon impurities either replacing a boron
(CB) or a nitrogen (C N) site, as depicted in Fig. 4. Both yield single occupied in-gap states,
closetothehBNconductionband(C B)orvalencebands(C N), ingoodqualitativeagreement
with the STS/STM data shown in Fig. 1.
With only one electron in a single state, there are no intra-impurity excitations possible.
Nevertheless, these most simple defects already allow us to study the impact of the envi-
ronment on the impurity orbitals. For both of these cases, the change in atomic structure
between bulk and monolayer is negligible, with C-N (C-B) bond lengths changing by 0.003 √Ö
(0.004 √Ö).
We construct localized Wannier orbitals for both C impurities, as depicted in Fig. 4(b).
Thesepz-like Wannier functions allow us to calculate the on-site energies tii, bare (v=viiii)
and cRPA screened ( U=Uiiii) Coulomb matrix elements, which we list in Tab. II. We see
that the diÔ¨Äerence in the bare Coulomb matrix elements between monolayer and bulk is
quite small (4%), indicating that the single-particle electronic structure [i.e., the shape of
thepz-like Wannier functions, see Fig. 4(b)] does not change signiÔ¨Åcantly between monolayer
and bulk. However, Uchanges signiÔ¨Åcantly, increasing by more than 50% in the monolayer
case compared to bulk. We can cast this into a change in the eÔ¨Äective dielectric constants

data of impurity #1in Fig. 1(a). The VBdefect creates three levels originating from
the dangling bonds due to the missing B atom. Two of these states are in close vicinity
to the valence band edge, nearly degenerate, and host together one electron, while the
third level is deeply buried within the valence band. In these cases, the hopping ma-
trixtijhas a 33form, while the screened Coulomb interaction Uijklis a rank-4 ten-
sor with three elements per dimension. To compare the Coulomb interactions, we de-

In Tab.III we compare all these parameters together with the single-particle energy sepa-

We Ô¨Ånd that single-particle energies associated with these defects [and thus the hoppings
in Eq. (1)] change by 2% for VBand 4% for VN. In contrast, the screened density-density
interactions decrease signiÔ¨Åcantly from monolayer to bulk by more than 50%. Similar to
the screening eÔ¨Äects for the C substitutional defects, this is driven by the eÔ¨Äective dielectric
constants decrease from 3in the bulk to2in the monolayer. Notably, the exchange
elementsJare nearly unaÔ¨Äected by the changes in the environment as a result of their
dipolar character. Indeed, macroscopic dielectric environmental screening mostly aÔ¨Äects
density-density Coulomb interactions in layered materials and does not signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äect
non-density-density elements [30, 44]. Thus, many-body properties which are strongly af-
fected by density-density Coulomb interactions, such as charge excitations, will be in general
most prone to changes in the dielectric environment, e.g., resulting from transition from bulk
13to monolayer hBN, while exchange interaction driven many-body states, such as spin exci-
tations, will be less aÔ¨Äected.

The picture that emerges from the simple defects discussed in the previous two chapters
outlines the key role of diÔ¨Äerential dielectric screening, which inÔ¨Çuences density-density
Coulombinteractionswithinandbetweendefectorbitals, inducingachangeintheproperties
upon varying the defect environment.
We now consider more complex defect/impurity structures, which have in-gap intradefect
transitions with possible technological relevance, and that could be detected by optical
means, as exempliÔ¨Åed in Sec. IIB. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we consider a carbon dimer (C BCN) replacing
nearest-neighbour B and N atoms with carbon, a carbon-vacancy complex (C BVN), and a
combination of a dimer with a neighbouring vacancy (C BCNVN). Especially C BCNhas
recently attracted signiÔ¨Åcant attention, as it was proposed as the origin of the 4.1 eV ZPL
single-photon emitter [45‚Äì47] observed in hBN based on the energetics of emission [48] and
calculations of photoluminescence lineshapes [49, 50]. All these impurity complexes have
modest formation energies [23, 25] and are thus likely to occur in both, monolayer and bulk
hBN upon C exposure. In Fig. 5 we summarize all model details.
From the DFT band structure calculations presented in Fig. 5 (a-c) we see that all three
impurity complexes form in-gap defect states with varying occupations (two electrons in
CBCNand C BVNand three electrons in C BCNVN). We use these states as the active space for
our minimal modelling [see Supplemental Material (SM) sec. S2 for details]. The resulting
lowest excited many-body levels are shown in Fig. 5 (d-f) with indications of the ground and
excited state types, singlets (S), doublets (D), triplets (T), and quadruplets (Q). We show
these energies calculated in the three cases schematically depicted in Fig. 3. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,
the inclusion of a constrained monolayer, i.e., where the defect structure is kept the same
as in bulk but the other atomic layers are removed, allows us to isolate the eÔ¨Äects of the
dielectric environment from changes in structure from the atomic environment. We thus
Ô¨Årst comment on the comparison between bulk and constrained monolayer, and then on the
eÔ¨Äect of relaxations between bulk and monolayer.
Throughout all impurity complexes, we see a consistent trend of decreasing optical transition
energies when changing from the constrained monolayer to the bulk hBN. Upon allowing
for further relaxation of the monolayer host system, this trend is mostly preserved. The de-
creasing excitation energies are more pronounced for singlets than for doublets and are often

many-body states are controlled by density-density and exchange Coulomb matrix elements
as illustrated for each defect below.
E. Many-Body States
1. CBCNMany-Body States
The C BCNcarbon dimer impurity can be approximately modeled as a half-Ô¨Ålled Hubbard
dimer [31, 51]. Analytically, the many-body eigenstates of the Hubbard dimer are solely
controlled by the ratio of the local density-density Coulomb repulsion Uand the hopping
tbetween the sites. In our case this dimer is formed by localized pz-like orbitals at the
16two C positions with local U0and interorbital Coulomb interactions U1, see Fig. 5(a). In
this scenario the eÔ¨Äective local Coulomb interaction magnitude is approximately given by
U=U0 U1[52, 53]. Upon increasing the screening from monolayer to bulk, both U0and
U1are signiÔ¨Åcantly but similarly reduced (e.g., U01:3eV and U11:1eV), such
that the resulting UdiÔ¨Äer by U0:2eV. This corresponds to a relative change of
nearly 40%. As the electronic hopping between the two pzWannier functions is aÔ¨Äected by
only 3% through the monolayer to bulk transition, we can again state that modiÔ¨Åcations
to the many-body properties are mostly driven by the changes in the dielectric screening.
This explains the reduction of the S1state by about 0:2eV. In contrast, the lower triplet
statesT1is less aÔ¨Äected by this screening, as it depends more strongly on Hund‚Äôs exchange
elements, which are nearly unaÔ¨Äected (see SM Table SIV). Further, the data presented in
Fig. 5(d) shows that atomic relaxations of the defect between bulk and monolayer do not
play a signiÔ¨Åcant role here (c.f. constrained monolayer and monolayer).

2. CBVNMany-Body States
For C BVNthe spinless DFT Kohn-Sham (KS) ground state is approximately given by two
electrons mostly residing in a C-centered px-like state [see side panel of Fig. 5(b)] with a
distortion of the C atom position out of the plane. The fully interacting many-body ground
state of this impurity can be well approximated as a single Slater determinant with two
electrons of opposite spin in the lowest Kohn-Sham state forming a singlet ground state. The
many-body singlet-singlet transitions approximately promote one of these electrons either
into a C-centered pz-like state (S0!S1, which lets the C atom relax back to the hBN plane)
17or into a delocalized state with two pz-like wavefunctions centered at the neighbouring B
atoms(S0!S2withreducedout-of-planeCpositiondistortion). Thebulkscreeningreduces
thecorrespondingtransitionenergiesby 0:2eVandby 0:24eVforS1andS2, respectively[c.f.
constrained-monolayer to bulk transitions in Fig. 5(e)]. A similar approximate Uanalysis
(using orbital averaged U0andU1given in the SM) yields an estimate of U0:2eV
(ca.20%). As the single-particle energies only change by less than 5% and since the Hund‚Äôs
exchange elements are nearly unaÔ¨Äected between the bulk and constrained monolayer hosts,
the overall trend in the many-body levels can again be explained based on modiÔ¨Åcations
to the density-density Coulomb matrix elements. Full relaxations towards the free-standing
monolayer enhance the out-of-plane C position distortion, which mainly aÔ¨Äects the single-
particle energies, while screened density-density and Hund‚Äôs exchange elements are nearly
unaÔ¨Äected (see Table SV). The single-particle KS energies change by about 0:1to0:2eV
in the freestanding monolayer with respect to the constrained monolayer, which is the same
order of magnitude as the many-body excitation energies change between the two systems.
3. CBCNVNMany-Body States
ThisdefectcomplexcanbeinterpretedasacombinationofC BCNandC BVN. TheKSground
state corresponds approximately to a fully occupied pz-like state centered on the C atom
farthest from the vacancy and a half occupied px-like state centered at the C adjacent to
the vacancy. This impurity thus hosts three electrons. Due to the spin degree of freedom of
the unpaired electron, the many-body ground state is two-fold degenerate forming a doublet
state, whosewavefunctionscanagainbewellapproximatedbyasingleSlaterdeterminantin
the band basis (see Table SX). The ground state structure shows an out-of-plane distortion,
mostly in the C position. Doublet-doublet excitations approximately promote the unpaired
electron from the pxorbital to delocalized pz-like orbitals at the neighbouring B (D0!D1
letting the C atom relax back to the plane), one of the electrons from the C pzto the C
px(D0!D2with enhanced out-of-plane distortions) and the unpaired electron from the
Cpxto Cpz(D0!D3also letting the C position relaxing back to the plane). Here,
the many-body energies are less inÔ¨Çuenced by the dielectric environment. D1,D2, andD3
change by about 0:03, 0:13, and 0:08eV respectively, although, as before the eÔ¨Äective
density-density Coulomb matrix element is reduced by about U0:15eV, while the
18single particle energies are aÔ¨Äected by less than 5% when changing from the constrained-
monolayer to the bulk hBN host. Thus only the D 2transition approximately follows U,
while the other excitations are less aÔ¨Äected. We attribute this diÔ¨Äerent behaviour to the
diÔ¨Äerence in the nature of the excitations: D1andD3are single electron excitations, while
D2takes place among three electrons and involves signiÔ¨Åcant modiÔ¨Åcations to the impurity
charge density. Under further relaxation towards the free-standing monolayer hBN, which
enhances the out-of-plane distortion, the main diÔ¨Äerence is that the many-body states D1
andD2become nearly degenerate. This is driven by modiÔ¨Åcations to the single-particle
Kohn-Sham energies, while the screened Coulomb interactions are approximately the same
(see monolayer to constrained-monolayer transition in Table SV).
4. Huang-Rhys factors
We now turn our focus to the Huang-Rhys factors SHR. In Tab. V we summarize all Q,
EFCandSHRfor both the free-standing monolayer and bulk hBN hosts. For both cases, we
Ô¨Ånd thatSHRcorresponding to the excited states in C BCNare considerably smaller than
in C BVNand C BCNVN. Quantitatively this is driven by the decisive out-of-plane distortion
of the C BVN/CBCNVNground state which is reduced in their excited states, yielding large
Q. This is related to the decisively modiÔ¨Åed impurity charge densities in C BVN/CBCNVN
upon excitation. In the ground states we Ô¨Ånd an in-plane charge density with pxsymmetry
localized partially on carbon and partially on the nearest boron sites in presence of the N
vacancy. Hartree terms (i.e. bare Coulomb repulsions) between these two partial densities
destabilize the planar crystal structure, shifting the carbon up in z-direction in the ground
state. Further full relaxation towards the free-standing monolayer limit enhances this out-
of-plane distortion, which consequently increases SHRvia enhancing Q. However, we note
that in actual experiments these additional distortions are likely suppressed by the presence
of a substrate or capping layer. In addition to Q, there is also a slight but consistent
trend ofEFCbeing less in bulk than in monolayer (C BCNis again the exception, though the
change is negligible).
19IV. DISCUSSION
A. Mechanisms for environmental eÔ¨Äects on defect properties
In Sec. II, we experimentally showed via PL measurements that the environment of carbon-
based defects aÔ¨Äected their properties, such as the energy of optical resonances and Huang-
Rhys factors SHR. In Sec. III, we explored theoretically the possible mechanisms for these
changes by comparing monolayer and bulk hBN hosts. In the following we summarize
our Ô¨Åndings, focusing mostly on defect complexes with technologically relevant intradefect
transitions.
Firstly, we consider diÔ¨Äerences in defect structure between monolayer and bulk hBN. These
changes are relatively minor when the distortions related to the defect are purely in the
hBN plane, as is the case for the single vacancies, single C impurities, and C BCN(see, e.g.,
Table V and SM). For defects with ground-state out-of-plane corrugation (e.g., C BVN), the
displacements are larger in monolayer than in bulk hBN hosts as there are no other hBN
layers to constrain them (see SM). The eÔ¨Äect of the increased distortions on the many-body
energy diÔ¨Äerences and Frank-Condon relaxation energies is relatively modest. However, SHR
can be signiÔ¨Åcantly larger in freestanding monolayer hBN hosts than in bulk ones for ex-
citations accompanied by out-of-plane to in-plane geometry relaxations, which signiÔ¨Åcantly
increase Qfor the corresponding transitions.
We furthermore show, that changing the hBN host environment mostly aÔ¨Äects screened
density-density Coulomb matrix elements within the impurity states, which can be reduced
in the bulk by up to 1:3eV, while single particle energies are modiÔ¨Åed by only up to 0:2eV,
and Hund‚Äôs exchange Coulomb matrix elements barely change. Both the interorbital and in-
traorbital density-density interactions are reduced signiÔ¨Åcantly in bulk hBN hosts by 50%
compared to the monolayer case. Quantifying this change with an eÔ¨Äective dielectric con-
stant give"bulk3to4, while"ML2to2:5depending on the defect. However, the extent
to which these changes aÔ¨Äect the intradefect many-body energies depends on how much
the many-body levels depend on the interplay and compensation of the (partially various)
density-density interactions and Hund‚Äôs exchange parameter J. Overall, the resulting trend
is that the energy separation of intradefect levels decreases in bulk compared to monolayer,
which is, in general, most prominent in charge excitations.
20B. Implications for defect identiÔ¨Åcation
OurÔ¨ÅndingshavesigniÔ¨ÅcantimplicationsfortheidentiÔ¨ÅcationofdefectsinhBNand2DvdW
layered hosts in general. Firstly, we point out that renormalization of optical transitions
from interactions and the correct treatment of spin symmetry is important for accurate com-
parison between experiment and theory, as is clear from comparing the KS single-particle
states in Fig. 5(a)-(c) with the many-body states (d)-(e). Here, this was achieved by our
embedding approach, which can often also be achieved, e.g., via SCF calculations utilizing
hybrid functionals and possibly corrections for spin contamination [54]. A representative ex-
ampleofthisobservationisC BVN, whereinthesingleparticlepicturetwotransitionsofabout
2 eV are expected, while in the many-body picture the singlet-singlet transitions appear at
energies above 3 eV, and triplet-triplet transition occur at about 1 eV [see Fig. 5(b,e)].
Moreover, we have shown that intradefect transitions within 2DvdW hosts are controlled
by additional degrees of freedom, i.e., the surrounding environment of the defects. In our
optical measurements this was tuned by the host-material thickness, while in theoretical cal-
culations we considered defects in bulk and monolayer hBN. The general trend of increasing
intradefect energies and increasing SHRin monolayer compared to bulk hosts are summa-
rized in Fig. 6: the host material can change both, QandEFC. Thus, for experimental
defect identiÔ¨Åcations within 2DvdW hosts, shifts in many-body energies and changes in SHR
should be taken into account across samples. On the other hand, such trends can be used to
aid defect identiÔ¨Åcation and characterization if a signal can be correlated between samples
of diÔ¨Äerent thicknesses, or on diÔ¨Äerent substrates.
In light of these results, we can reexamine the defects observed in the PL measurements
described in Sec. IIB. In the considered energy range, we observed four types of defects
with varying emission energies and Huang-Rhys factors SHR, which behave diÔ¨Äerently upon
variation of the hBN Ô¨Ålm thickness. The defects A2andA4have PL resonances in the range
of the doublet-doublet transitions related to VNandVBcontaining defects, respectively.
However,SHRfor these defects is much larger than observed experimentally [55]. A3likely
involves a defect similar to the carbon dimer, which might be coupled to neighbouring
vacancies, as it shows a relatively small SHRand strong sensitivity of the PL resonance
energy to the hBN Ô¨Ålm thickness. Defect A1is characterised by the largest SHRand lowest
emission energy (within our series). Assuming that A1is a simple defect, we could attribute

it to the triplet-triplet transition within C BVN. However, it is also plausible that this defect
does not belong to the defect space considered here. Interestingly, the investigated defects
exhibit vanishing small Zeeman splitting, when the magnetic Ô¨Åeld is applied perpendicularly
to the hBN plane (see SM, Fig. S1). This observation may indicate that the optically active
transitions are dominated by singlet-singlet transitions, however, the transitions between
the parallel branches of the spin-split doublets and triples cannot be excluded.
Finally, we point out that we have not explicitly considered the eÔ¨Äect of a substrate in
22this work. Depending on the substrate the impact on the defect properties may change
signiÔ¨Åcantly. On one hand, we would expect that the substrate could conÔ¨Åne out-of-plane
lattice distortions caused by the defect similar to the additional layer within bulk hBN hosts.
On the other hand, the dielectric screening from certain substrates might be signiÔ¨Åcantly
larger compared to the moderate enhancement from monolayer to bulk hosts. Substrates
with signiÔ¨Åcant lattice contributions to the dielectric susceptibility may result in eÔ¨Äective
relative dielectric constants of 20 and above [56, 57].
C. Defects for detecting local dielectric susceptibility
We can use the sensitivity of defects in 2DvdW materials as probes of the local dielec-
tric environment of, e.g., other surfaces, adsorbed molecules, or conÔ¨Åned liquids [58]. An
ideal defect for such applications should exhibit an optically accessible intradefect transi-
tion that has a strong dependence on the dielectric environment. Also, the defect should
be characterized by a spectrally narrow optical signal providing good sensitivity and res-
olution for determining the properties of the dielectric environment. Thus a small SHRis
desired. Finally, it would be ideal if the defect properties were relatively insensitive to other
environmental stimuli such as external magnetic or electric Ô¨Åelds.
Experimentally, defect A3appears as the best candidate for detecting the local dielectric
constant. The PL emission resonance shifts by E= 60:1meV between the 50 nm thick
hBN Ô¨Ålm and 10-layer-thick hBN Ô¨Ålm. We can estimate the upper bound of the modiÔ¨Åcation
of the relative dielectric constant sensed by the defect within the two Ô¨Ålms based on our
calculation to be "<2. Therefore, we can conclude that our sensitivity towards the local
dielectric constant is better than "=E < 0:03meV 1. The resolution is limited by the
linewidth of the PL resonance , which also depends on the layer thickness. In the bulk
form, the line exhibits its largest broadening, = 7:4meV, which corresponds to the change
of the relative dielectric constant " <0:22. In the monolayer form, = 1:5meV, which
yields "<0:05.
From our theoretical point of view, the singlet-singlet transition in C BCNis a promising
candidate. Although it has rather high energy, its ZPL has been detected and identiÔ¨Åed
previously [45‚Äì48]. Here, we have demonstrated that it is highly sensitive to the defect
environment. Also, it has a Huang-Rhys factor that does not change with the dielectric
23environment, so its ZPL will remain sharp. Finally, it is a singlet-singlet transition, such
that it likely will not be aÔ¨Äected by stray magnetic Ô¨Åelds. It may however shift under the
application of electric Ô¨Åelds since the defect has a relatively low symmetry (point group C2v).
Therefore, carbon defect centres in hBN can be used as sensitive detectors of local dielectric
constants, addressing the need of measuring the environmental eÔ¨Äects on a nanoscale.
V. CONCLUSIONS
Using a combination of experiment and theory, we have elucidated the eÔ¨Äect of the environ-
ment on defect properties in hBN. We show via PL measurements of few-layer and bulk-like
samples, that carbon-based defects exhibit shifts in ZPL energies, as well as changes in
phonon sidebands and ZPL lineshapes, which can be quantiÔ¨Åed via Huang-Rhys factors.
Using Ô¨Årst-principles theory and embedding methods applied to monolayer and bulk hBN,
we show that the key eÔ¨Äect of the environment arises from modiÔ¨Åcations in the eÔ¨Äective
local dielectric screening acting on the correlated impurities. This alters the inter- and
intra-orbital impurity Coulomb interactions and plays a role in reducing optical emission
energies for intradefect transitions in bulk versus mono/few-layer hBN hosts. These eÔ¨Äects
must be taken into account when performing defect identiÔ¨Åcation via a comparison between
experiment and theory. A plausible application of our Ô¨Åndings is a detector for local dielec-
tric constants, easily integrable with solid, soft, and liquid matter systems in pristine and/or
functionalized form.
METHODS
Crystal growth Thepristineultra-purehBNcrystalshavebeengrownviathehigh-pressure
temperature-gradient method. A part of the crystals from a single growth batch was an-
nealed in a graphite furnace at a temperature of 2000C for an hour.
Sample fabrication The hBN:C Ô¨Ålms were isolated through mechanical exfoliation of bulk
crystals onto 300 nm thick Si/SiO 2substrates. In the transfer process, the substrates were
heated to 50C to increase the yield of thin hBN:C Ô¨Çakes, which exhibit homogeneous and
reproducible optical emission. The thickness of the Ô¨Ålms, typically ranging between a few
layers to a few tens of nanometers, was determined by optical force microscopy.
24For STM studies, hBN:C crystals were mechanically exfoliated onto 90 nm-thick Si/SiO 2
substrates. 1 up to 3 layer-thick Ô¨Ålms, identiÔ¨Åed via optical contrast and AFM techniques,
were subsequently lifted with a PDMS/PC stamp and transferred onto a large graphite
Ô¨Çake that was partially covered by a Cr/Au Ô¨Ålm, providing a conductive surface for the
STM measurements. The samples were cleaned with DCM, ACE, and IPA, and Ô¨Ånally
annealed in an ultra-high vacuum in the STM chamber to remove any polymer residues
from the transfer process.
Optical characterisation The PL spectra were measured in a back-scattering geometry
under continuous-wave 514 nm excitation. The sample was cooled down via exchange gas in
aclosed-loopcryostatorviacoldÔ¨Ångerinacryostatcooledwithliquidhelium. Thelaserwas
focused on the surface of the sample to a spot of about 1 m via an objective. The sample
was positioned under the objective using x-y-zpiezo-scanner system. The PL signal was
resolved by a spectrometer and detected by a charge-coupled device camera. The second-
order photon correlations were measured in the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss conÔ¨Åguration
with avalanche photodiodes acting as photon detectors.
Scanning tunneling microscopy The scanning tunneling microscopy was done in a low-
temperature Createc system with base pressure below 10 10mbar. In our samples, the
tunnelling occurred between the tungsten tip and graphite substrate through a 3-layer-thick
carbon-doped hBN barrier. The dI/dVtunnelling spectra were measured at a modulated
voltage between 3 meV and 10 meV at the frequency of 700-900 Hz. The tip was calibrated
for spectroscopy against the surface state of gold in 111 orientation.
Theoretical methods Density functional (DFT) electronic structure calculations are
performed within the Vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp) [59, 60] utilizing the
projector-augmented wave (PAW) [61] formalism with PBE generalized-gradient approxi-
mation (GGA) [62] of exchange-correlation functional. For details on of the mapping to the
minimal models and their solutions see SM.

VI. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Appendix A: Photoluminescence of hBN in magnetic Ô¨Åeld
To gain a better sense of the nature of the observed spectral lines in photoluminescence
(PL) experiments, we studied the optical response of the material in a magnetic Ô¨Åeld. Low-
temperature micro-magneto-PL experiments were performed in the Faraday conÔ¨Åguration,
where the magnetic Ô¨Åeld is applied perpendicularly to the crystal plane. Measurements were
carried out with the aid of a split-coil superconducting magnet up to 14 T. The sample was
placed on top of an x-y-z piezo-stage kept at T = 4.2 K and was excited using a laser
diode with energy below the hBN band gap. The combination of a quarter wave plate and
a linear polarizer placed in the insert was used to analyse the circular polarization of the
signal. The emitted light was dispersed with a 0.75 m long monochromator and detected
with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The result for +polarization from +14 T
26to -14 T (reversing the direction of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld yields the information corresponding
to the other polarization component) is presented in Fig.7. As can be appreciated from
the false-colour map no signiÔ¨Åcation changes can be observed while applying the external
magnetic Ô¨Åeld, we do not detect any Zeeman splitting of the emission. The lack of magnetic
Ô¨Åeld eÔ¨Äects on the optical spectra of hBN:C is likely to indicate that the optically active
transitions are dominated by singlet-singlet transitions, nevertheless, transitions between
parallel branches of spin doublets and triplets cannot be ruled out.

between bulk to thinner samples, we construct defects embedded in an hBN monolayer with
15 √Ö vacuum space along zdirection from the fully relaxed bulk geometries. This corre-
sponds to the constrained monolayer case, while further relaxation of these supercells results
in the free-standing monolayer setups. Excited states were studied by performing structural
optimization with the constrained occupation of single-particle states (constrained DFT).
The defect related electronic states were constructed from Wannier functions [63] (see Fig. 8)
i, which we calculate using the wannier90 package [64]. These Wannier functions form
the basis to construct the extended Hubbard models. In order to preserve the symmetry

291. Details of Hamiltonian
In this section we provide single-particle hopping terms tij(Table VII), density-density
Coulomb and exchange interactions (both bare in Table VIII and screened in Table IX) in
the Wannier basis for defect complexes embedded in free-standing monolayer, constrained
monolayer and bulk hBN lattices. A summary of orbitally averaged parameters is given in
Table X.
