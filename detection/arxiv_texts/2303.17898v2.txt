Information-Theoretic Study of Time-Domain
Energy-Saving Techniques in Radio Access
Franc ¸ois Rottenberg
Abstract
Reduction of wireless network energy consumption is becoming increasingly important to reduce
environmental footprint and operational costs. A key concept to achieve it is the use of lean transmission
techniques that dynamically (de)activate hardware resources as a function of the load. In this paper,
we propose a pioneering information-theoretic study of time-domain energy-saving techniques, relying
on a practical hardware power consumption model of sleep and active modes. By minimizing the
power consumption under a quality of service constraint (rate, latency), we propose simple yet powerful
techniques to allocate power and choose which resources to activate or to put in sleep mode. Power
consumption scaling regimes are identified. We show that a “rush-to-sleep” approach (maximal power in
fewest symbols followed by sleep) is only optimal in a high noise regime. It is shown how consumption
can be made linear with the load and achieve massive energy reduction (factor of 10) at low-to-medium
load. The trade-off between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) is also characterized,
followed by a multi-user study based on time division multiple access (TDMA).

A. Motivation
As of 2022, yearly data volume has gone up to more than 3 Zettabytes ( 1021bytes) and the
traffic continues to rise at a rate of about 25%/year [1]. Energy efficiency has improved over
the years but not fast enough, which results in an annual energy consumption growth of 2.5%
for the ICT sector [1]. It is becoming increasingly important to reduce energy consumption of
wireless communication networks to reach climate ambitions and reduce operational expenses,
in other words, “break the energy curve” [2], [3]. Most energy of wireless networks is consumed
by the radio access network (RAN) and more specifically at base stations [4], [5]. Moreover, the
traffic load at a base station is highly varying across the day and most often lightly loaded, with

traffic at night being about 10 times lower than during the day [6]. This opens a big potential
for energy reduction through the use of lean transmission techniques that dynamically activate
or deactivate resources as a function of the load, letting the system dynamically switch from
fully active to deep sleep mode.
B. State of the Art
Energy-saving techniques are a popular topic. A large effort has been made to integrate these
techniques into industrial products and standards. The 5G standard was for instance designed
with a lean paradigm in mind which resulted in, e.g., less reference signaling to increase
sleep duration [7]–[9]. At low-to-medium load, a popular scheduling technique is a “rush-to-
sleep” approach which compacts transmission in as few symbols as possible. These symbols
are transmitted at maximal power, leaving the remaining symbols in the frame free, so that the
sleep duration is maximized. Many studies have been performed to evaluate the gains of such
techniques based on standardized power models [5], system-level evaluations [10]–[14] and aided
by actual measurements [15]. The use of machine learning was also identified as an interesting
tool to predict traffic and/or to optimize energy-saving features [16], [17]. We refer to [8] for a
review of these techniques.
Despite much work in the domain, there remains a fundamental gap to be filled by establishing
an information-theoretic study of time-domain energy-saving techniques, even for basic systems
such as single input single output (SISO) transceivers. Going back to the underlying physics
of energy consumption of base stations and with a proper mathematical formulation of the
communication link, a lot of additional understandings and improvements can be obtained: opti-
mization of algorithms, finding optimal power scaling regimes as a function of load, guarantees
of optimality for energy-saving features and/or finding the gap from it with existing techniques...
As an example, it is not clear if or when a rush-to-sleep approach is optimal or not. We should
mention that many recent works have performed this kind of energy-saving studies but they have
focused on the spatial domain and more specifically the optimal operation of massive MIMO
systems (number of active antennas, served users, power allocation) as a function of the load [18]–
[22]. On the other hand, information-theoretic time-domain studies are lacking. The fundamental
studies on energy-efficient communications have mainly focused on a stationary transmission of
symbols in time at a constant rate and average transmit power PT[23]–[27]. Considering an
ideal consumption model and a quasi-static channel, this choice seems intuitive. To clarify it,DRAFT 3
let us formalize the problem. The channel capacity of a complex discrete memoryless additive

and the bound is tight if uniform power allocation is used, i.e.,pn=PT= (2R−1)σ2, for
n= 0, ..., N −1. Intuitively, the log dependence of the rate implies diminishing returns. Starting
from a non-uniform allocation, it can always be improved by reallocating some power from the
time interval with the highest allocated power to the one with the lowest power.
In practice however, the consumed power Pcons is far from being equal or even linearly
proportional to the transmit power PT. This is due to two main reasons, namely: i) as soon as a
given time slot is active, a static load-independent power consumption is present due to activation
of hardware components such as radio-frequency chains and baseband processing units; ii) the
load-dependent power consumption, i.e., the dependence of Pconsinpn, is typically concave as
power amplifiers (PAs) are more energy-efficient close to their saturation. Intuitively, this implies
that the “cost” of using more power decreases when a large output power is transmitted. These
two effects will counterbalance the log penalty and push towards using a reduced number of
active time slots, especially in low-to-medium load scenarios.

C. Contributions
This paper presents a pioneering information-theoretic study of time-domain energy-saving
techniques, using a realistic power consumption model. The transmission model considers single-
antenna base stations and users. Even for such a basic system, a comprehensive study of energy-
saving features is lacking, which is the gap this paper is aiming to fill. The investigated techniques
provide drastic energy reduction by dictating how to dynamically (de)activate hardware resources
as a function of the load. The optimization problems are formalized as the minimization of Pcons
for a given rate. More specifically, the structure of our paper and our contributions are structured
as follows. Section II presents the hardware power consumption model used in this work, with
two distinct contributions: active and sleep energy consumption. The active power consumption
model is shown to address a large variety of PA classes. Section III considers the optimal
allocation of time resources in a single-user scenario. The solution is approached step by step
through lemmas to get more insight on its nature. Linear and exponential scaling regimes of Pcons
as a function of the load Rare identified. Asymptotic results for large Nare provided that greatly
simplify the analysis while having negligible performance penalty. We prove that a rush-to-sleep
approach is optimal in a noise limited regime but not otherwise. The optimal trade-off EE-SE
is also derived from previous results and we show that a maximal SE does not always provide
a maximal EE. Section IV then extends previous results by considering successive sleep modes,
resulting in drastic energy reductions. Section V considers the extension to a multi-user scenario
where users are multiplexed using TDMA. The optimal allocation is provided for the most
promising regime in terms of energy-savings, i.e., the low-to-medium-load scenario where Pcons
linearly scales with the rate of each user and the system is not fully active. Finally, Section VI
concludes the paper.
Notations : The operators ⌈.⌉,⌊.⌋and[.]are the ceil, floor and round operators, respectively.
The operator ⌊x⌉which we refer to as the ceil-floor operator selects among the upper and
lower bounding integers of xthe one that optimizes the cost function. The function W(z)is the
Lambert W function, i.e., the solution of z=W(z)eW(z). We use the notation f(x) =O(g(x)),
asx→a, if there exist positive numbers δandλsuch that |f(x)| ≤λg(x)when 0<|x−a|< δ.
II. P OWER CONSUMPTION MODEL
As described in the introduction, we consider the transmission of Nsymbols, each of duration
T[s]. The full frame has thus a duration NT [s]. Out of the Nintervals, a number Naare activeDRAFT 5
and actually transmitting information while the remaining N−Naare inactive and in sleep mode.
This implies that 0≤Na≤N. For minimizing latency and maximizing the sleep duration which
allows entering a deeper sleep mode [28], the Naactive intervals are grouped together at the
beginning of the transmission. We define as Eactive the energy consumed during active time slots,
which is assumed to depend on the transmit power at each time interval, i.e.,p0, ..., p Na−1. On
the other hand, Esleeprepresents the energy consumed during sleep modes, which is non zero as
all hardware components cannot be switched-off. It is assumed to depend on (N−Na)Tas a
longer sleep duration allows to enter a deeper sleep mode [28]. The average consumed power
over the frame duration is thus given by
Pcons=Eactive(p0, ..., p Na−1) +Esleep((N−Na)T)

In the following, we detail the models of the sleep and active energy consumption. As a
benchmark, we also introduce the ideal consumption model
Pideal
cons=1
NNa−1X
n=0pn, (2)
implying that the consumed power is equal to the transmit power. In other words, no losses are
present.
A. Active Energy Consumption
Using the well-established model from [29], the active power consumption can be modelled
as
Pactive =PPA+PRF+PBB
(1−σDC)(1−σMS)(1−σcool)
where PPA,PRFandPBBare the powers consumed by the PAs, the radio-frequency chains and
the baseband unit respectively. The coefficients σDC,σMSandσcoolare the loss factors related
to DC-DC power supply, mains supply and active cooling respectively.
We are interested in modelling the dependence of the active consumed power Pactive in the
output power at each active time slot p0, ..., p Na−1. The base station (BS) power consumption
analysis of [29] showed that mainly the PA consumed power PPAscales with the output power.
The other terms are thus considered load-independent. The active energy consumed across the
frame duration can thus be written as
Eactive(p0, ..., p Na−1) =T
η 
Na˜P0+Na−1X
n=0PPA(pn)!DRAFT 6

DC-DC σDC 7.5%
Mains supply σMS 9.0%
Cooling σcool 10.0%
Efficiency η= (1−σDC)(1−σMS)(1−σcool)75.8%
where ˜P0=PBB+PRFandη= (1−σDC)(1−σMS)(1−σcool). Values of loss factors and
efficiencies used in evaluations are shown in Table I. To model the PA consumption, we use the
following model
PPA(p) =PPA,0+βpα,0≤p≤Pmax (3)
with α∈]0,1]andβ≥0. The first term PPA,0represents the load-independent consumption
while the second is load-dependent. This load dependency does not typically scale linearly with
p. The fact that α∈]0,1]implies concavity of PPA(p). This concavity comes from the fact that
a typical PA efficiency is improved when moving closer to saturation [30]. The constant Pmax
denotes the maximal transmit power.In practice, Pmaxis (much) lower than the PA saturation
power, that we denote by Psat. The use of the so-called back-off Pmax/Psatis required as
recent technologies, e.g., orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), have high peak-
to-average power ratio (PAPR). A back-off (typically from -12 dB to -6 dB) prevents the PA
to enter the saturation region, which would otherwise create nonlinear distortion impacting the
signal quality and creating out-of-band emissions. The authors of [31] have justified in details
the use of a similar model as (3) through their own measurements and a literature review [32],
[33]. Model (3) is more general as it also includes a load-independent component, which is
useful for particular PA architectures.
1) Ideal Power Amplifier: PA consumed power is linearly proportional to the output power
giving PPA,0= 0,β=α= 1 and
Pideal
PA(p) =p.
2) Class A Power Amplifier: PA consumed power is independent of the load and has a
maximal efficiency of 1/2giving PPA,0= 2Psat,β= 0 and
PA
PA(p) = 2 Psat
where Psatis the saturation power of the PA.DRAFT 7
3) Class B Power Amplifier: The PA consumed power has a load dependence that scales with
the square root of the output power giving PPA,0= 0,β=4
π√Psatandα= 1/2
PB
PA(p) =4
πp
Psat√p
This model has much relevance for typical base stations working with a significant back-off
from saturation [31]. Some authors sometimes call it the “traditional” PA model [34]. Therefore,
by default, we will use it in following evaluations, with a 8 dB back-off.
4) Envelope Tracking Power Amplifier: According to the curve fitted model proposed in [35],
PA consumption was shown to be modelled as
PET
PA(p)≈aPsat
(1 +a)ηmax+1
(1 +a)ηmaxp,
where a= 0.0082 . This model can again be seen as a special case of (3).
5) Doherty Power Amplifier: Theℓ-way Doherty PA consumed power is given by [25]

where ξ=p/P sat. The class B model is obtained as a special case when ℓ= 1. Except in such
particular cases, the model proposed in (3) cannot exactly represent such PAs but can provide
an approximation depending on the operating range of the Doherty amplifier.
Remark 1. We previously described how model (3) can address typical theoretical PA models.
However, it can also be fitted for practical PAs based on measurements and/or datasheets. The
PA was identified as the main load-dependent contribution. However, more generally, the model
proposed in (3) can take into account other load-dependent terms.
In the light of this remark, we formalize the underlying assumption about the load-dependent
active energy consumption model used throughout this work.

B. Sleep Energy Consumption
In the ideal consumption model (2), the sleep energy consumption is exactly null. In practice,
not all hardware can be switched off as always-on reference signals are required to allow
users to access the network. Moreover, different hardware components have different activa-
tion/reactivation latencies. Hence, depending on the sleep duration, more or less components
can be switched off. Therefore, power models have been proposed that consider successive sleep
modes as a function of the sleep depth. We define the power consumption in sleep mode as
Psleep(t), where t= 0 is used a reference for the system entering sleep and tis the sleep
duration so that Esleep(0) = 0 . Given the fact that increasing sleep duration allows to switch off
more hardware components, we introduce the following assumption.
(As2):Psleep(t)is monotonically non-increasing.
Proposition 1. Under (As2), the sleep energy consumption Esleep(t)is a concave function of
the sleep duration t.
Proof. Directly follows from (As2).
Remark 2. (As2)does not imply continuity of Psleep(t), which can have jump discontinuities.
Switching-off components might lead to a non-continuous drop of Psleep(t), as shown in Fig. 1.
Popular models for Psleep(t)include the use of different sleep modes. The model in [28] has
been used as a qualitative and quantitative reference for several years by companies [36]. MoreDRAFT 9

Constant sleep power model (As4) Psleep(t) =Psleep=P1
recently, 3GPP has introduced an improved model, expressed in relative units with respect to
the deep sleep mode, that better reflects current trends [5], [37]. The model contains four sleep
modes and numerical values are given in Table II for one configuration described in [5]. These
values will be used as an example in evaluations.
We can formalize this model mathematically. Let us define as Sthe number of sleep modes,
starting from mode 0 (no sleep) to mode S(deepest sleep mode). The start and end of each
sleep mode are denoted by TsandTs+1, with T0= 0 andTS+1= +∞. The sleep power
consumption during mode sis denoted by Ps. This notation is consistent with the definition of
P0which denotes the load-independent active power consumption. This corresponds to “sleep
mode zero”, taking place until T1, where no hardware components are actually switched off.

We also introduce another popular sleep power model widely used in the literature and shown
to be accurate to characterize 4G long term evolution (LTE) macro base stations [29].

where Psleep is the constant sleep power consumption defined in (As4). When P0−Psleep= 0,

where W(z)is the Lambert W function, i.e., the solution of z=W(z)eW(z). In the following,
the general solution of (7) is approached step by step, introducing several lemmas, which provide
insight on its form and scaling as a function of R. Finally, the trade-off SE versus EE will be
characterized.
A. Optimal Allocation for Load-Dependent Consumed Power
The following lemma provides the power allocation that minimizes the load-dependent part of
the average consumed power under a rate constraint and without a maximal per-time slot power
constraint. Under (As1), the load-dependent part of Pconscan be identified as

αand the ratio δ= (P0−Psleep)/(γσ2α).
Proof. See Appendix VII-A.
Remark 4 (Frame of N= 2 symbols) .To illustrate Lemma 1, Fig. 2a considers the particular
caseN= 2,γ= 1. It shows contour plots of the constraint Rand the cost function Pld, as a
function of p0andp1. In the case α= 1, implying linearity of consumed and transmit power,
the objective function curve (p0+p1)/2 = 3 is a straight line. As shown in the introduction,
utilization of the two time slots is always optimal ( Na= 2), with uniform power allocation.
However, for α= 1/2, this is not anymore the case. For low values of R, it is better to only
useNa= 1 slot while for large R,Na= 2 is optimal, again with uniform power.
Remark 5 (Scaling of Nafor general Nandα).For an arbitrary value of Nandα∈]0,1],
the number of activated time slots Nascales approximately linearly with the rate Rup to the
point where the maximal number Nis allocated, i.e., when R > R a. When R≤Ra, the rate
per activated time slot is approximately equal to Ra. The “approximate” nature comes from the
rounding operation. This error disappears for large N, as will be formalized properly in the
following. The constant Rais independent of Rand is a function of α. As shown in Fig. 2b for
the case δ= 0 (P0=Psleep= 0),Ramonotonically decreases as a function of α, implying thatDRAFT 12
more time slots are activated for a fixed value of R. In the asymptotic cases of αapproaching
0 or 1, a single ( Na= 1) or all time slots ( Na=N) are allocated, respectively.
B. Optimal Allocation with no Maximal Power Constraint
The following lemma gives the power allocation that minimizes the averaged consumed power
under a rate constraint and without a maximal per-time slot power constraint. Removing this
constraint provides the solution when it is not binding, i.e., when the user experiences a good
channel (low normalized noise variance σ2=Lσ2
n) and its target rate is not too high. The general
case will be addressed in next subsection.

Under (As3)−(As4), the solution is

Proof. See Appendix VII-A.
Remark 6 (Relation with Lemma 1) .Lemma 2 extends the result of Lemma 1 by considering a
non-zero sleep power Psleepand load-independent active power consumption P0. Under a constant
sleep power model (As4), the problem has a similar solution.
Remark 7 (Scaling of Ra).As shown in Fig. 2b, Raincreases with δ= (P0−Psleep)/(γσ2α).
This implies that less time slots should be activated if normalized noise power σ2,Psleep andγ
are small and if the active load-independent power consumption P0is high. A major difference
with Lemma 1 is that Radoes not go to zero as αapproaches 1 when δ > 0. This implies
that, given nonzero static power consumption, not all time slots should always be activated. The
particular load-independent case γ= 0 implies that Ra= +∞andNa= 1. This makes sense
asPconsthen only depends on Na. As shown in next subsection, considering a finite maximal
transmit power per time slot will change this result.DRAFT 13

C. Optimal Allocation with Maximal Power Constraint
We now consider the additional constraint of a finite maximal per-time slot power Pmax. This
constraint may render the problem unfeasible. Therefore, we introduce the following assumption.
(As5) : Problem (7) is feasible, i.e.,
R≤Rmax= log2
1 +Pmax
σ2
.
The exact solution of problem (7) generally requires an iterative solution.
Proposition 2. Under (As1)−(As2),(As5), the solution of the problem (7) can be obtained
by using Algorithm 1.
Proof. See Appendix VII-B.
To avoid the need of an iterative solution and the ceil-floor operator, we use the fact that
the problem greatly simplifies by considering the asymptotic case of a large N. Then, the ratio
Na/Ncan be considered asymptotically continuous instead of only taking discrete values.
Remark 8 (Large Nassumption) .The large Nassumption is realistic in practice as frames are
typically made of many symbols. Moreover, the assumption of having a sufficiently large Nis
central and implicit in this work. This article investigates the gain of activating only a share
of transmission time slots. To be able to do this, some flexibility in the number of activated
resources should be available, implying a sufficiently large N.DRAFT 14

Remark 9. For large N, the solution has a simple form: the ceil-floor operator is replaced by a
rounding operator. The power and number of bits per-activated time slot ( ˜Pand˜R) are constantDRAFT 15
in the linear regime. As shown in Fig. 3a and 3b, the approximation error can barely be seen
and is already negligible for small values of Nsuch as 10 or 50.
Remark 10 (Scaling regimes) .Lemma 1 puts forward two scaling regimes: linear and exponen-
tial. They can easily be identified in Fig. 3a. In Fig. 3b, a higher noise regime is considered so
that only the linear regime is present ( ˜R=Rmax).
Remark 11 (Gain with respect to uniform allocation) .Fig. 3a and 3b also plot the gain with
respect to a uniform allocation, i.e.,pn= 
2R−1
σ2forn= 0, ..., N −1. As expected, the
gain is larger at low load (rate) where the optimal allocation only activates few resources.
Remark 12 (Rush-to-sleep) .IfRmax≤Ra(high noise regime, Fig. 3b), a rush-to-sleep approach
is optimal: active time slots transmitting at full power Pmaxand rate Rmax. This minimizes Na
and maximize sleep duration. If Ra< R max(low noise regime, Fig. 3a), reduced transmit power
should be used instead and not even using sleep for R > R a. It is then better to fully activate
the system with a uniform allocation.
Remark 13 (Converse problem) .We here consider the minimization of Pconsfor a fixed R.
The maximization of Rfor a fixed Pconscan also be considered. It could occur if power is
available and should directly be used, e.g., a solar panel or wind turbine without battery and/or
not connected to the grid. The solution can be found using same methodology or directly by
“reverting” the result of Theor. 1. Indeed, the allocation that minimizes Pconsfor a fixed rate
Ris also the allocation that maximizes Rfor the minimal value of Pconsof the inital problem.
Scaling regimes of Ras a function of Pconswill be linear and logarithmic. It is here omitted
due to space constraints.
D. Trade-Off: Spectral Efficiency versus Energy Efficiency
Considering that the transmission occupies a bandwidth B= (1 + αrol)/T, where αrol∈[0,1]
is the roll-off factor, so that the SE and the EE are
SE =R
TB=R
1 +αrol[bits/s/Hz] ,EE =BSE
Pcons=R
TPcons[bits/Joule] . (12)
Given these relationships, the trade-off SE-EE can be easily identified from previous results.
Corollary 1. Under (As1)−(As5), the optimal EE for a given SE is:DRAFT 16

□IfSE>˜R/(1 +αrol)(implying R > ˜R):
EE =BSE
P0+γσ2α(2SE(1+ αrol)−1)α.
Proof. From the definition of the EE in (12), it is clear that its maximization is equivalent to
the minimization of Pcons. As a result, the optimal allocations and the results of Theor. 1 can
directly be used, which lead to the above results. The two cases correspond to the linear and
exponential scaling regimes of Theor. 1, respectively.
Corollary 2. Under (As1)−(As5), the SE that maximizes the optimal EE given in Corollary 1
is:

Remark 14 (Scaling of EE-SE) .Fig. 4a and 4b plot the EE as a function of the SE for the
optimal and uniform allocation. Most gain in terms of EE (not absolute energy) is obtained at
medium SE. The plots are obtained by varying the rate R, all other parameters being fixed.

IV. O PTIMAL ALLOCATION FOR PIECEWISE CONSTANT SUCCESSIVE SLEEP MODES
Fig. 3a and 3b have shown promising gains to reduce consumed power at low load. However,
they are still limited by the relatively high sleep power consumption Psleep. Similarly, Fig. 4a
and 4b can seem limited as one would hope to obtain an EE that is approximately flat as a
function of the SE. The reason is the same: a too high Psleep.
To drastically reduce energy consumption at low-to-medium load, it is of paramount impor-
tance to implement successive sleep modes and use a frame duration long enough so that the
system can enter these sleep modes. To find the optimal allocation, the iterative algorithm of
Prop. 2 can be used, which requires to solve problem (11) at each iteration. This is an integer
programming problem which can have a significant complexity. If the problem is relaxed by
considering Nacontinuous, it remains challenging to solve as it implies the minimization of the
concave function Esleep(t)(Prop. 1).
If the sleep power consumption is assumed piecewise constant, according to (As3), a simple
allocation can still be found. This sleep power model was detailed in Section II-B and Fig. 1.
For a given Na, only sleep modes such that Ts≤(N−Na)Tcan be entered. We define
N+
a,s=N−⌊Ts/T⌋so that sleep mode scan be used if Na≤N+
a,s. Depending on the target rate
R, it might be unfeasible to use a given sleep mode because of the maximal power constraint
per time slot. A minimum of active time slotsNR
Rmaxis required to satisfy it. Otherwise, the power
per time slot would have to be higher than Pmaxto satisfy the rate constraint. Mode sis thusDRAFT 18

We also define ˜Rs= min( Ra(s), Rmax).

Remark 16. Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b are plotted based on the same simulation parameters as Fig. 3a
and 3b, but with a different sleep model. Using successive power modes has a drastic impact on
the consumed energy at low load. A key parameter to allow drastic savings is to have a largeDRAFT 19

to 200 ms. Hence, deep sleep power mode can be entered but not hibernating sleep power mode.
Remark 17. Similarly, Fig. 6a and 6b can be compared to Fig. 4a and 4b, where only the
sleep model differs. As ideally expected, the EE quickly reaches a plateau. To still improve this
behaviour, a longer frame duration can be used.
V. O PTIMAL ALLOCATION FOR TDMA S YSTEM
We now extend previous results by considering a downlink transmission from the BS to K
users. We consider the constant power sleep model so that (As1)−(As4)hold. The users
are multiplexed using TDMA. In the frame of Nsymbols, each symbol is allocated to the
transmission towards at most one user so that no inter-user interference is present. Out of the N
symbols, Nksymbols are allocated to user k, fork= 0, ..., K −1. The power associated to the
n-th symbol transmitted to user kis denoted by pk,n, where n= 0, ..., N k−1andk= 0, ..., K−1.
The normalized noise variance σ2

a specific path loss Lk. The consumed power is then

where Na=PK−1

minimizing the power consumption, under (As1)−(As4)and per-user rate constraints Rk. The
problem can be formulated as

Moreover, we define the constant Rk,athat minimizes the convex problem

We also define ˆRk= min( Rk,a, Rk,max)andˆPk= min( Pk,a, Pmax). Two regimes can be consid-
ered for Problem (13), depending if the constraintPK−1
k=0Nk≤Nis binding or not.
In terms of power savings, the most promising case is the low-to-medium load regime where
the constraint is not binding. In that case, the problem fully decouples per-user and the linear
regime solution of Theor. 1 can directly be used on a per-user basis.

If the constraintPK−1
k=0Nk=Nis binding, Problem (13) is coupled between users and
challenging to solve. As the sleep duration is zero, the power consumption becomes

As this regime does not allow switching-off components, relatively small energy reduction
potentials are expected. Given space constraints, we do not provide a more detailed solution.
One possibility is to reduce the target rates of the users to make the constraint non-binding and
then use Theor. 3. Another possibility is to use conventional scheduling policies, that are not
aware of sleep capabilities, which makes sense as the system is fully active.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this work, we have proposed a fundamental study of time-domain energy-saving techniques
in radio access. The results provide key novel insights from an information-theoretic perspective.DRAFT 22
Considering equal gain parallel communication channels, conventional information-theoretic
results state that all channels (time slots in this study) should be equally used to minimize
transmit (not consumed) power under a rate constraint. On the contrary, popular energy-saving
techniques steer towards an extreme opposite “rush-to-sleep” approach: compact transmission in
as few time slots as possible, at maximal transmit power, to maximize sleep duration.
Using a realistic power consumption model, our information-theoretic study bridges the gap
between these two extremes. Simple allocations are provided that allow drastic energy savings
reaching factors of 10 at low load. At low-to-medium load, the optimal number of active time
slots is linearly proportional to the rate, resulting in a power consumption which linearly scales
with the rate. At a higher load, all time slots become allocated. The rush-to-sleep approach is
shown to be optimal in a high-noise regime but not otherwise. In a low-noise regime, it might
be better to use a fully active system. Moreover, the fundamental trade-off between EE and SE
is revisited leveraging the time-domain hardware sleep capabilities. Transmitting at maximal SE
maximizes the SE in a high-noise regime while, in a low-noise regime, a reduced SE maximizes
the EE. Considering a sleep model with increasing depth complicates the study but also greatly
increases the energy-saving gains. For a piecewise constant model, simple allocations can still be
found. Finally, for a multi-user TDMA system, single-user results are applicable on a per-user
basis in the low-to-medium load regime, where the system should not be fully active and where
sleep-aware energy-saving gains can be achieved.
VII. A PPENDIX
We start by introducing two lemmas that will be useful in the following.
Lemma 3. An optimal solution of the following problem

must have a uniform allocation among active time slots: ∀n, n′, ifpn>0,pn′>0thenpn=pn′.
Proof. The case α= 1 was already treated in the introduction.For α= 0, the cost function
only depends on the number of active time slots so that a single time slot must be allocated
power. In the following, we will use a proof by contradiction for the case 0< α < 1. Any
non-uniform power allocation has at least two time slots, say n= 0andn= 1(potentially using
a re-indexing), that are such that p0>0,p1>0andp0̸=p1. We consider the power allocatedDRAFT 23
to the other time slots as fixed and optimize the cost function with respect to p0andp1only.
For the sake of clarity, we define ρn=pn/σ2. The reduced problem is
min
ρ0,ρ1˜f(ρ0, ρ1) =1X
n=0ρα
ns.t.1X
n=0log (1 + ρn) =Z
where Z=NRlog 2−PN−1
n=2log (1 + ρn). The constraint implies that
ρ1=eZ
1 +ρ0−1 (15)
so that ρ0andρ1take values only in the domain [0, eZ−1]and have a one-to-one relationship. As
ρ0→0,ρ1→eZ−1and vice versa. Moreover, the problem is symmetrical so that ˜f(ρ0, ρ1) =
˜f(ρ1, ρ0). Using (15), the problem can be rewritten as a monovariable unconstrained problem

To find the critical points, we set f′(ρ0) = 0 and combining with (15), we find the condition
0 =ρ1−α
1(1 +ρ0)−ρ1−α
0(1 +ρ1) (17)
which shows that there is always one critical point in ρ0=ρ1=eZ/2−1. Moreover, the fact that
the problem is symmetric implies an odd number of critical points: if there is a critical point in
˜ρ0, there is one ineZ
1+˜ρ0−1. Using again (15), we can rewrite the condition (17) as
0 = ( eZ−1−ρ0)1−α(1 +ρ0)1+α−ρ1−α

The point ρ0= 0 is not a critical point. Hence, we can restrict to ρ0>0and divide by ρ1−α

points/alternations of ˜g(ρ0). Setting ˜g′(ρ0) = 0 gives the condition

As shown in Fig. 8, three cases can be distinguished. In case (a), there is a single critical
point in ρ0=ρ1=eZ/2−1which is a maximum. In cases (b) and (c), there are three critical
points: the middle one in ρ0=ρ1=eZ/2−1will now be a minimum (local in (b), global in (c))
while the two on its sides are maxima. Hence, global minima can only be obtained for either
ρ0= 0, ρ1=eZ−1orρ1= 0, ρ0=eZ−1orρ0=ρ1=eZ/2−1. Hence, it is impossible to
find an optimal allocation such that p0>0,p1>0andp0̸=p1.
Lemma 4. Under (As1)−(As4), the following function is convex for x >0
f(x) =P0−Psleep+γσ2α(2x−1)α

Proof. Under (As4),P0−Psleep≥0and thus (P0−Psleep)/xis convex. Given that the sum of
two convex functions is convex, it is sufficient to show that

y
is convex for y >0(using y=xlog 2 ). Its second derivative is
g′′(y) =(ey−1)α−2(e2y(α2y2−2αy+ 2)−ey(αy2−2αy+ 4) + 2)
y3.
Given that y >0, we have directly that y3>0,(ey−1)α−2≥0and it is sufficient to show that
h(y) =e2y(α2y2−2αy+ 2)−ey(αy2−2αy+ 4) + 2 ≥0.DRAFT 25

Forr= 2, this is verified as 2α2−6α+ 4 = 2( α−1)(α−2)is always positive for α∈[0,1].
Forr= 3, this is also verified as α212−α24 + 12 = 12( α−1)2is again positive for α∈[0,1].
Forr≥4, we have r(r−1)≥r2/2,3−2r−r≥ −2r+1and−2−r+4≥ −1so that

strictly larger than 1 and the term is positive for α∈[0,1], which concludes the proof.
A. Proof of Lemmas 1 and 2
One can first note that Lemma 1 is a particularization of Lemma 2 when P0=Esleep(t) =
0. Hence, the result will be found as a specific case in the following. Under (As1)-(As2),
Problem (7) can be rewritten as

which shows that only the second term depends on the power allocation, i.e., the term defined

time slots. For a given Na, the rate constraint fixes the transmit power per active time slot

Hence, the problem can be reformulated as finding the optimal number of active slots Nathat

the problem becomes

From Lemma 4, we know that f(x)is convex. Given the definition of xand the integer nature
ofNa,xcan only take discrete values in practice. Given the fact that f(x)is convex, it is
guaranteed that one of the neighboring possible values of Ra= arg min f(x)is optimal. As a

B. Proof of Proposition 2
The algorithm is initialized by the solution of the relaxed problem assuming that no max
power constraints are binding. The solution is then given by Theor. 2. If the solution is such
thatpn≤Pmax,∀n, the problem is solved. On the other hand, if, for at least one time slot
pn> P max, at least one of the constraints must be binding. Hence, the algorithm allocates the
maximal power Pmaxto one additional time slot. The rate constraint on the remaining time slots
is then adapted. The power allocation is re-computed assuming that no max power constraint is
binding on the remaining time slots not yet set to Pmax. Again, the solution is given by Theor. 2.
Again, the algorithm checks if the max constraint is verified. If yes, the algorithm has converged.
If not, it enters a novel iteration and so on until convergence.
C. Proof of Theorem 1
Let us consider one by one four different cases. On the one hand, the exponential regime
mentioned in the theorem where R > ˜Rand i) ˜R=Rmaxor ii) ˜R=Ra. On the other hand, the
linear regime mentioned in the theorem where R≤˜Rand iii) ˜R=Raor iv) ˜R=Rmax.
Case i) : This case is not applicable according to (As5)as it is unfeasible to have R > R max.DRAFT 27
Case ii) : The case together with (As5)implies Rmax≤R > R a. From Lemma 2, we can
find that Na=Nand the corresponding power allocation, which is well feasible as it does not
violate the Pmaxconstraint. The exponential regime result of Theor. 1 is then found.
Case iii) : This case implies R≤Ra≤Rmax. Let us first consider that the maximal power
constraint per time slot is not active such that we can use the result of Lemma 2. If R≤Ra,
the optimal number and ratio of active time slots are
Na=⌊RN/R a⌉=RN
Ra
+ϵ1=RN
Ra+ϵ2
Na
N=RN
Ra
/N+ϵ1

where |ϵ1|<1and|ϵ2|<1. The optimal ratio Na/Nasymptotically converges to R/R aand the
same occurs if the optimal number of time slots Nais approximated using a rounding operator
instead of the ceil-floor operator. Using this result, as N→+∞, the optimal power allocation
per active time slot of Lemma 2 can be rewritten as
pn=
2RN
Na−1
σ2=Pa+O(1/N) (20)
where Pa= 
2Ra−1
σ2andNacan be the ideal value ⌊RN/R a⌉or its approximation using
the rounding operator. Given that Ra≤Rmax, this allocation does not violate the Pmaxconstraint
and the result is feasible. The power consumption becomes
Pcons=Psleep+Na
N(P0−Psleep+γPα
a+O(1/N)) =Psleep+RP0−Psleep+γPα
a
Ra+O(1/N).
Case iv) : This case implies R≤Rmax≤Raand thus Pa> P maxsuch that allocation (20) is not
feasible. As an alternative, the iterative Algorithm 1 can be used and simplified in the asymptotic
regime. Indeed, as N→+∞, at each iteration, the algorithm allocates a constant power Pa
(independent of R) to active time slots, not yet set to Pmax. At the convergence of the algorithm,
the allocation will have approximately RN/R maxactive time slots with maximal power Pmax
and rate Rmax. As a result, as N→+∞, at the optimum, Na/N= [R/R max] +O(1/N) =
R/R max+O(1/N)and the allocation
Na=RN
Rmax
, pn=Pmaxforn= 0, ..., N max
is asymptotically optimal and achieves a consumed power
Pcons=Psleep+RP0−Psleep+γPα
a
Rmax+O(1/N).
Cases iii) and iv) can be written more compactly using the definitions of ˜Rand˜P, giving the
linear regime result of Theor. 1.DRAFT 28
D. Proof of Corollary 2
The results of Corol. 2 can be found by minimizing the EE expression in the two regimes
of Corol. 1. In the regime where SE≤˜R/(1 +αrol), it is clear that the EE is maximized for
the largest SE, i.e., when SE = ˜R/(1 + αrol). Moreover, if Ra≥Rmax, we have ˜R=Rmax
and the second regime of Corol. 1 is not feasible. The optimal SE corresponds to the maximal
SE,SEmax=Rmax/(1 + αrol). On the other hand, if Ra< R max,˜R=Raand the regime
SE>˜R/(1 +αrol)can be entered. The optimization over ¯Rthen provides the optimum and can
only improve the optimum as ¯Ris allowed to take value Ra.
E. Proof of Theorem 2
It is direct to see that one should choose the optimal allocation among feasible sleep modes.
Under (As3), the sleep energy consumption at time tif sleep mode sis used is Esleep,s(t) =
Esleep(Ts) + (t−Ts)Pswhere Esleep(Ts) =Ps−1
s′=0Ps′(Ts′+1−Ts′).2The consumed power using
sleep mode scan then be written as
Pcons,s=˜Es
NT+Na
NP0+γ
NNa−1X
n=0pα
n+N−Na
NPs
where ˜Es=Esleep(Ts)−TsPs. This form is similar to the one given in (6), under (As4). The
sole differences are the presence of Psinstead of Psleepand the constant ˜Es/(NT), which affects
the cost function but does not impact the optimization. The result of Theorem 1 can then be
used: uniform allocation among Na,sactive mode is optimal. The only difference is the fact that
the maximal value of Na,sisN+
a,sinstead of N, so that the sleep duration is sufficient to enter
mode s. As a result, we find Na,s=h

If the constraintPK−1

so that the asymptotic solution of Theorem 1 can be used giving Nk=h

2No deeper sleep mode than sis considered even if Ts+1< t, which could decrease sleep energy consumption. Still, this
does not affect the optimization result a deeper sleep mode will perform better and will be chosen instead.DRAFT 29
Section VII-C, we know that, as N→+∞,Nk/N=Rk/ˆRk+O(1/N)and the constraint can
thus be equivalently written asPK−1
k=0Rk/ˆRk≤1 +O(1/N).
