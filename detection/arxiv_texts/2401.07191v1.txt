Optimizing valley dynamics is an e ﬀective instrument towards precisely manipulating qubit in the context of
two-dimensional semiconductor. In this work, we construct a comprehensive model, involving both intra- and
intervalley channels of excitons in monolayer WSe 2, and simultaneously takes the light-matter interaction in to
account, to investigate the optimal control of valley dynam ics with an initial coherent excitonic state. Based on
the quantum speed limit (QSL) theory, we propose two optimal control schemes aiming to reduce the evolution
time of valley dynamics reaching the target state, along wit h to boost the evolution speed over a period of time.
Further, we emphasize that the implementation of dynamical optimization is closely related to the detuning
diﬀerence—the diﬀerence of exciton-laser ﬁeld detunings between the KandK′valleys—which is determined
by the optical excitation mode and magnetically-induced va lley splitting. In particular, we reveal that a small
detuning diﬀerence drives the actual dynamical path to converge towards the geodesic length between the ini-
tial and ﬁnal states, allowing the system to evolve with the l east time. Especially, in the presence of valley
coherence, the actual evolution time and the calculated QSL time almost coincide, facilitating high ﬁdelity in
information transmission based on the valley qubit. Remark ably, we demonstrate an intriguing enhancement in
evolution speed of valley dynamics, by adopting a large detu ning diﬀerence, which induces an emerging valley
polarization even without initial polarization. Our work o pens a new paradigm for optically tuning excitonic
physics in valleytronic applications, and may also o ﬀer solutions to some urgent problems such as speed limit
of information transmission in qubit.
I. INTRODUCTION
Along with the discovery of the direct band gap at two in-
equivalent KandK′points of the Brillouin zone, transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) MX 2(M=Mo, W; X=S, Se,
Te) have emerged as ideal candidates for novel microscopic
devices [ 1,2]. Beneﬁting from space-inversion asymme-
try together with strong spin-orbit interaction, there for ms a
spin-valley-locked electronic structure, protected by the time-
inversion symmetry, which leads to opposite spin splitting at
the two distinct valleys [ 3]. This has motivated a host of
hot research topics in valley physics, such as the control ov er
valley polarization [ 4–7] and valley coherence [ 8–12], valley
Hall eﬀect [2,13], as well as valley entanglement [ 14,15].
Also, owing to the large electron and hole e ﬀective masses
and reduced dielectric screening, the monolayer TMDCs ex-
hibit strong Coulomb interactions. This enables the format ion
of tightly bound excitons with remarkably large binding en-
ergy up to hundreds of meV [ 16–18], allowing for excitonic
valley control even at room temperature.
The spin-valley-locked excitonic states can be formed di-
rectly by using circularly polarized light ( σ+andσ−), based
on the optical selective rule [ 2,19–21]. Further, the interval-
ley transition of excitons between KandK′requires a spin ﬂip
for both electrons and holes [ 22,23]. Hence, in close analogy
with spin and its associated applications in quantum inform a-
tion, the valley pseudospin as an additional degree of freed om,
provides a fascinating platform to encode and process binar y
information [ 4,15,24], that underlines a prospective coher-
ent control based on spin-valley-locked excitonic states. And,
*xsj@sdu.edu.cn
†yongjf@qfnu.edu.cnthe coherent excitonic states can be initialized, controll ed, and
read out on ps time scale [ 25,26].
A fundamental requirement for information processing de-
vices is the ability to universally control the qubit state o n a
time scale shorter than its coherence time. With existing te ch-
nology applications, the question naturally arises as to ho w to
optimally manipulate these devices. Particularly for vall ey-
coherent exciton states, whose relatively short coherence time
(∼ps) restricts the spatial transmission of information abou t
the logical process in the valley qubit [ 8,25,27,28]. Despite
several eﬀorts that have been made to boost the valley coher-
ence time, e.g. exciton-cavity coupling [ 29], electron dop-
ing [ 30], magnetic suppression [ 10], and enhanced dielectric
screening [ 31], how to optimally govern the valley dynamics
that incorporates both excitons generation, intravalley r ecom-
bination, intervalley transfer and coherence loss process es, to
facilitate information transmission, is still not availab le.
In this work, we construct a comprehensive model that in-
corporates both intra- and intervalley channels of exciton s
in monolayer WSe 2, and simultaneously consider the light-
matter interaction, to endow an unambiguous scheme for op-
timally tuning valley dynamics. To this end, we employ the
quantum speed limit (QSL) theory, which stipulates the min-
imum time for a quantum system to evolve from an initial
state to its distinguishable state [ 32–39]. For linearly polar-
ized excitation with an initial coherent superposition of e x-
citonic states, we propose two optimal control schemes of
valley dynamics with respect to di ﬀerent performance mea-
sures , allowing to tune the evolution time and average speed
of valley dynamics by the detuning di ﬀerence. We reveal that
a small detuning di ﬀerence favors the reduction of evolution
time of valley dynamics, enabling the actual dynamical path
to converge towards the geodesic length between the initial
and ﬁnal states. In contrast, a large detuning di ﬀerence leads2

to an enhanced average evolution speed, accompanied by a
pronounced excitonic population imbalance (the di ﬀerence of
remnant excitonic populations between the KandK′valleys).
The practical application of the two optimal schemes in sys-
tem ﬁdelity and valley polarization as well as the e ﬀect of
magnetic ﬁeld induced valley Zeeman splitting is also dis-
cussed. Our results facilitate the practical application o f the
QSL theory in TMDC ﬁeld, and stimulate valley quantum in-
formation probing more magneto-optical features.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II,
we show our theoretical framework describing both intra-
and intervalley scatterings of excitons in monolayer WSe 2,which are essential for determining the QSL time and evo-
lution speed of the valley system. In this context, we derive
the diﬀerential equations of density matrix of the system, and
then propose two optimal protocols of valley dynamics based
on the QSL theory. In Sec. III, we investigate the associated
controls of valley dynamics for reducing evolution time and
for accelerating the evolution speed, by means of the optica l
excitation and magnetic ﬁeld. Also, we emphasize their prac -
tical applications in system ﬁdelity and valley polarizati on.
Finally, we summarize our main conclusions in Sec. IV.
II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
We begin by considering monolayer WSe 2[Fig. 1(a)] as
the physical system to study the associated optimal proposa l
of valley dynamics, which can be extended to other W-based
and even Mo-based TMDC materials. To this end, we ﬁrst
introduce the intra- and intervalley channels of excitons, and
then give a dynamical description of the valley system inter -
acted with a laser ﬁeld. Based on the geometric QSL theory,
we introduce two types of optimal protocols of valley dynam-
ical evolution.
A. Intravalley channels: selective excitation and radiati ve
recombination
For the intravalley channels, the conduction band minima
and valence band maxima are both located at the degenerate
KandK′points at the corners of Brillouin zone [Fig. 1(b)].
As the KandK′valleys are related to each other by time-
reversal symmetry, there is a one-to-one correspondence be -
tween two valleys for either the optical excitation or the re -
combination process. Proceeding from the orbital symme-
try, the threefold rotation ( C3) splits the dorbitals of tran-
sition metal atoms into three groups: A1(dz2),E(dxy,dx2−y2),
E′(dxz,dyz). The ﬁrst-principles calculation indicates that the
wave functions at conduction ( |ψc∝an}bracketri}ht) and valence (|ψv∝an}bracketri}ht) band
edges are|ψc∝an}bracketri}ht=|dz2∝an}bracketri}htand|ψξ
v∝an}bracketri}ht=1√
2(|dx2−y2∝an}bracketri}ht+iξ|dxy∝an}bracketri}ht) [2,19],
withξ=±1 the valley index. Further, the C3rotational op-
eration of TMDCs requires the symmetry adapted basis func-
tions satisfy C3|ψa∝an}bracketri}ht=exp(−i2π
3ma)|ψa∝an}bracketri}ht(a=c,v), with ma
the magnetic quantum numbers for conduction and valence
bands extrema. Then considering the transition matrix ele-
ment Wcv=∝an}bracketle{tψc|P±|ψv∝an}bracketri}ht, withP±=Px±iPythe electric
dipole moment, the chiral optical selectivity can be deduce d,
corresponding to the absorption of right- ( σ+) and left-handed
(σ−) photons at the KandK′valleys, respectively.
Regarding the radiative recombination of excitons, it is on e
important process that leads to the energy loss and decoher-
ence, which can be described by the Fermi’s golden rule.
The exciton emits one photon with momentum qand light
modeλ, from an excited state |Ψξ(Q),0∝an}bracketri}ht(ξ=K,K′) to the
ground state|G,1λq∝an}bracketri}ht. In this process, the decay rate of an ex-
citonic state ξwith center-of-mass momentum Qis given by

nian in the dipole approximation, Eξ(Q) and Eλqthe en-
ergies of exciton and photon, respectively. Here the exci-
tonic state|Ψξ(Q)∝an}bracketri}htcan be unfolded as a superposition of hole
(with crystal momentum k) and electron (with crystal momen-
tum k+Q) states from band pairs ( v,c) in the reciprocal
space, namely,|Ψξ(Q)∝an}bracketri}ht=/summationtext

cient. Note that the decay rate at momentum Q=0 reads

lus of the BSE exciton transition dipole element, cthe speed

ing the thermal eﬀect in exciton recombination process, the
radiative lifetime of an exciton in ξvalley at temperature T
isτξ=τ0
ξ[3Mc2kBT/2E2

ξthe recombina-
tion time near T=0, and Mthe exciton mass. Hence, the
exciton lifetime increases linearly with elevated tempera ture,
while inversely proportional to the square of excitonic ene rgy
Eξ(0) at KandK′valleys.
B. Intervalley channels: electron-hole exchange and
exciton-phonon interactions
Since the intervalley scattering of excitons requires not
only the spin-ﬂip of electrons and holes, but also the mo-
mentum conservation, there are two dominated interval-
ley scattering mechanisms: electron-hole (e-h) exchange
and exciton-phonon (ex-ph) interactions. For the former,
in the basis{|K,Q∝an}bracketri}ht,|K′,Q∝an}bracketri}ht}, the long-range intervalley ex-
change interaction can be written as Hex=JQ[cos(2θ)σx+
sin(2θ)σy] [8,42–45], withσx,ythe Pauli matrixs, Qthe
center-of-mass momentum, and θthe orientation angle. Here
the momentum-dependent exchange interaction reads JQ=
π
4α2|ψ(0)|2/radicalbig
2TQ/Ry, with Ry the Rydberg energy, αthe ef-
fective ﬁne structure, TQthe kinetic energy of center-of-mass
motion, and|ψ(0)|2the probability that an electron and a hole
spatially overlap respectively [ 46]. In monolayer WSe 2, we
consider Ry=75.66 meV ,α=0.66, and|ψ(0)|=0.88 [8],
leading to a consequence of JQ=20 meV×/radicalbigTQ/37.83.
Hence, the magnitude of e-h exchange interaction essential ly
scales linearly with the center-of-mass momentum of excito n,
and direction depends on the orientation of exciton momen-
tum.
Note that, both the magnitude and direction of Q-dependent
exchange interaction are random during the intervalley pro -
cess, due to various scatterings from phonons, other excito ns
and defects, that provides an e ﬀective in-plane magnetic ﬁeld
driving valley pseudospin precession with di ﬀerent frequen-
cies [ 15,45]. This is similar to the one that deals with the
D’ykonov-Perel (DP) spin relaxation for 2D electron gases
in the diﬀusive regimes [ 47]. As a consequence, the val-
ley pseudospin precession leads to an incoherent intervall ey
transfer [Fig. 1(b)], which is manifested by a statistical aver-
age intervalley scattering time τeh[10]. However, in the pres-
ence of external magnetic ﬁeld, the expectation value of pse u-
dospin depends on the combined contributions of in-plane(e-h exchange interaction) and out-of-plane (external ver ti-
cal magnetic ﬁeld) components. The external magnetic ﬁeld-
induced valley splitting suppresses the intervalley scatt ering
related to exchange interaction [ 10]. Thus, the exchange-
related scattering rate reads Γeh=1/τeh×F(∆E), where
F(∆E)=Γ2/(Γ2+∆E2) [22,23], withΓthe width param-
eter associated with exciton momentum relaxation [ 48], and
∆E=EK′−EKthe valley Zeeman splitting.
Regarding the ex-ph interaction, both the electron and hole
conﬁned in an exciton require one K-point phonon to satisfy
zero center-of-mass momentum of the exciton before and af-
ter intervalley scatterings. For this, the intervalley sca tter-
ing rate for momentum conservation is proportional to the
phonon occupation number, i.e., Γph∝exp(−∝an}bracketle{t/planckover2pi1ωph∝an}bracketri}ht/kBT) [6],
with∝an}bracketle{t/planckover2pi1ωph∝an}bracketri}ht=12 meV the acoustic phonon energy near the
K-point [ 49–52], closing to the acoustic phonon energy re-
ported in TMDCs [ 6,53,54]. Note that the lifting of val-
ley degeneracy due to magnetic ﬁeld causes an asymmetric
phonon-assisted relaxation process, which requires that e xci-
tonic scatterings from the valley of higher energy to the one
of lower energy emitting an additional phonon ( ΓH), whereas
absorbing a phonon occurs in the opposite process ( ΓL). Con-
sequently, the scattering rates are mediated by the Boltzma nn
factor and can be expressed as Miller form, namely, ΓH=Γ ph
andΓL=Γ phexp(−∆E/kBT) [55,56].
Combining two part contributions from e-h exchange and
ex-ph interactions, the total intervalley scattering rate s can be
written asΓu,d=Γ eh+Γ H,L[10]. Figure 1(c) displays the
intervalley scattering time Tu,d=1/Γu,das a function of mag-
netic ﬁeld at low temperature. We observe that the scatterin g
time Tugrows with magnetic ﬁeld and rapidly reaches sta-
bility. This is because the large Zeeman splitting regardin g
strong magnetic ﬁeld fully quenches the exchange interacti on-
induced intervalley scattering, while phonon-assisted in terval-
ley process from a higher valley in energy to lower valley is
unaﬀected. In contrast, the intervalley scattering from a lower
valley in energy to higher valley is heavily suppressed due
to the valley splitting, leading to a dramatic rise in scatte r-
ing time Td. Furthermore, the intervalley scattering not only
causes incoherent transfer of excitonic population from on e
valley to another, but also an additional exciton valley de-
coherence (i.e., pure dephasing), which is, an essential co m-
ponent of valley dynamics. Considering the Maialle-Silva-
Sham (MSS) mechanism, the random e-h exchange interac-
tion induces an additional coherence loss, that is analogou s
to dephasing in conventional semiconductors and spin depo-
larization in germanium, also driven by intervalley scatte r-
ing [ 8,30,57]. Also, optical two-dimensional coherent spec-
troscopy reveals that the ex-ph interaction contributes si gnif-
icantly to pure dephasing [ 11], which should be taken into
account.
C. Valley dynamical evolution: model Hamiltonian and
master equation
In order to control the valley dynamical evolution in opti-
cal devices, we mainly consider a two-valley system, which4
interacts with a laser ﬁeld [Fig. 1(d)]. Further, we consider
the Zeeman shifts of energy bands caused by an external ver-
tical magnetic ﬁeld, which induces an asymmetric intervall ey
scattering from K(K′) valley to K′(K) valley with the scat-
tering rateΓd(Γu). This allows us to construct a model with
three-level states, namely, excitons in the K(|K∝an}bracketri}ht) and K′(|K∝an}bracketri}ht)
valleys and the ground state ( |0∝an}bracketri}ht) [58].
Incorporate the intra-and intervalley scattering channel s
into the master equation of Lindblad form, then we employ
the density matrix to illustrate the valley dynamics. The to -
tal dynamical evolution of system is composed of four parts:
unitary process, intervalley scattering, intravalley exc iton re-
combination and pure dephasing, satisﬁes
d
dtρt=L0(ρt)+Lf(ρt)+Lr(ρt)+Lp(ρt). (1)
For the part of unitary evolution, it is driven by the system
Hamiltonian and can be described by the Liouville operator
L0(ρt)=−i[H,ρt]. In the basis{|K∝an}bracketri}ht,|K′∝an}bracketri}ht,|0∝an}bracketri}ht}, the system
Hamiltonian reads, H=Hex+HIn, comprising contributions
from the valley ( Hex), and the interaction term ( HIn). Here the
ﬁrst term,
Hex=/summationdisplay
ξEξc†
ξcξ, ξ=K,K′,(2)
describes the exciton energies at separate KandK′valleys.
In the presence of magnetically-dependent Zeeman e ﬀect, the
exciton energy is written as Eξ=E0+ξµBgB/2, with E0the
energy at zero ﬁeld, ξthe valley index ( ξ=1 for Kandξ=−1
forK′valley),µBthe Bohr magneton, and gthe Lande factor
for bright exciton in monolayer WSe 2.c†
ξ(cξ) stands for the
exciton creation (annihilation) operator of the ξvalley. The
relationship between magnetic ﬁeld and energy levels of two
valleys is displayed in Fig. 1(e).
The second term in the form of rotating wave approxima-
tion [ 59], giving rise to Rabi oscillations between the ground
state (|0∝an}bracketri}ht) and excitonic states ( |K∝an}bracketri}htand|K′∝an}bracketri}ht), is expressed
as [15,60,61]
HIn=gKeiωRtσK−+gK′eiωLtσK′−+H.c., (3)
whereωRandωLare the frequencies for right ( σ+) and left
(σ−) circularly polarized excitation modes, respectively. We
deﬁneσξ−=|0∝an}bracketri}ht∝an}bracketle{tξ|as the lowering operators and H .c.means
the Hermitian conjugate. The parameter gξ=∝an}bracketle{t0|/vector µ·/vectorE|ξ∝an}bracketri}ht/2 is
the dipole coupling strength for σ±excitation, with /vector µthe elec-
tric dipole moment and /vectorEthe amplitude of laser ﬁeld. Without
loss of generality, we consider gξis real with gξ=g∗
ξ. To elim-
inate the time-dependence induced by light-matter interac tion
in the Eq. ( 3), we apply an unitary transformation on the initial
system Hamiltonian H, namely,H=UHU†+i/planckover2pi1˙UU†[60],
where the transformation matrix

withωRL=ωR−ωL. Hence the transformed system Hamilto-
nian can be written as

detuning at zero magnetic ﬁeld. We deﬁne the symmetric and
asymmetric excitations as ∆K=∆ K′(ωR=ωL) and∆K/nequal∆K′
(ωR/nequalωL), respectively. Further, in the presence of magnetic
ﬁeld, which gives rise to the valley Zeeman splitting ∆E, we
introduce the detuning di ﬀerence as∆d=|∆K−∆K′−∆E|
to manifest the eﬀect of magnetic ﬁeld on the exciton-laser
ﬁeld detuning. Note that in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld, the
detuning diﬀerence depends only on the zero-ﬁeld detuning
∆ξ. Substituting Eq. ( 5) into the Liouville equation, we obtain
the unitary evolution part of valley dynamics.
The intervalley scattering caused by the e-h exchange and
ex-ph interactions, leads to an incoherent transfer of exci -
tonic population from one valley to another [ 29,62], de-
scribed by ˙ρK=−ΓdρK+Γ uρK′, and ˙ρK′=Γ dρK−ΓuρK′,
withρKandρK′the probabilities of ﬁnding exciton located
in the Kand K′valleys after recombination, respectively.
Also, the quantum coherence transfer will be limited by the
intervalley scattering process [ 63]. For the part of intraval-
ley exciton recombination, the related description is pro-
vided by the following equation of Lindblad form Lr(ρt)=/summationtext

ence of magnetic ﬁeld, the opposite Zeeman shifts in KandK′
valleys contribute to the di ﬀerence inΓKandΓK′. Beyond the
loss of remnant excitonic population, the recombination al so
leads to a valley decoherence, which provides an upper bound
for coherence time [ 8]. Further, the e-h exchange and ex-ph
interactions induce the pure dephasing of exciton valley co -
herence [ 8,10,30], which can be expressed by this Lindblad

between three occupied states (i.e., |K∝an}bracketri}ht,|K′∝an}bracketri}htand|0∝an}bracketri}ht). Here
the coherence intensity characterizing the degree of valle y co-
herence can be deﬁned as C(ρ)=|ρKK′|+|ρK′K|[10,33], with5
0≤C(ρ)≤1. Also, the coherence time τCcan be interpreted
as the time over which C(ρ) essentially vanishes.
D. Optimal protocol of valley dynamics: geometric quantum
speed limit
In this subsection, we ﬁrst outline the geometric QSL the-
ory, and introduce both the minimum evolution time (i.e., th e
QSL time) and average evolution speed of valley dynamics,
from which, we further illustrate two types of optimal proto -
cols of valley dynamics.
The QSL sets the lower bound on the evolution time be-
tween two distinguishable states of a quantum system [ 65,66],
that has manifold applications in quantum coherence [ 67],
quantum resource theories [ 68], optimal control [ 32,39,69],
and quantum thermodynamics [ 70,71], quantum battery [ 72,
73], among other ﬁelds. For an open dynamical process, geo-
metric approach is a typical tool to study the QSL problems,

est one among all dynamical evolutions between two distin-
guishable quantum states |ψ0∝an}bracketri}htand|ψτ∝an}bracketri}ht[Fig. 1(f)] [ 66]. Phys-
ically, the geometric QSL time for a quantum system evolving
from an initial state ρ0to a ﬁnal state ρτcan be derived from
the inequality between the lengths of the geodesic and actua l
path [ 74],

i=1D(ρ(i−1)∆t,ρi∆t)=L(ρ0,ρτ), (7)
where the actual evolution time τis divided into ninﬁnites-
imal time∆t=τ/nwith n→+∞. The saturable case with
equality holds if the quantum system evolves from the ini-
tial stateρ0to ﬁnal state ρτalways along the geodesic. Fur-
ther, the instantaneous speed along the actual path can be ex -
pressed as v(t)=d

lim∆t→0D(ρt,ρt+∆t)=lim∆t→0[L(ρ0,ρt+∆t)−L(ρ0,ρt)]. Based
on this, the generalized QSL time associated with the time-

The geometric description of geodesic is crucial for deriv-
ing the QSL time in an open dynamical process [ 66]. There
are a class of QSLs that can be investigated based on di ﬀerent
geometric metric, such as Bures angle [ 33,34,74], trace dis-
tance [ 36], relative purity [ 76,77], quantum Fisher informa-
tion [ 74], and Wigner-Yanase information [ 66,78]. Hereafter,
we restrict our analysis to the geodesic length characteriz ed by
the Euclidean distance, given by D(ρ0,ρτ)=∝bardblρτ−ρ0∝bardblhs, with
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm ∝bardblX∝bardblhs=/radicalbig

evolution speed in Eq. ( 10) describes the overall behavior of
valley dynamics, involving in the exciton generation, intr aval-
ley recombination, intervalley scattering, together with valley
coherence loss.
Optimal control theory aims to ﬁnd a feasible control pat-
tern, to optimize a particular performance measure [69,81].
In the paradigm of valley dynamics, we mainly consider the
following two performance measures to be optimized: (i) the
actual evolution time of evolving to the target state ( τ), and
(ii) the average evolution speed over a period of time [¯ v(τ)].
For the former, we use the ratio of the QSL time over the ac-
tual time (i.e., τm/τ) to investigate the optimal scheme, which
indicates how far the valley dynamical evolution is from the
selected geodesic path [ 33,66]. When the actual evolution
path and the geodesic path coincide, the ratio is equal to
one [ 82,83], which is the optimal situation. This allows the
valley system to evolve along a path that takes the minimum
time. For the latter, the optimal control calls for a faster e vo-
lution speed ¯ v(τ) over a period of time (0 ∼τ), which is only
associated with the actual evolution path L. Note that there is
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between two types of optimal protocols.
The reduction in actual evolution time largely requires tha t the
valley system evolves along a shorter path. However, accel-
erating the valley dynamics would not necessarily require t he
system evolution path to converge towards the geodesic path .
Sometimes, the valley dynamics may have a faster speed in a
longer evolution path.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Regarding the quantum information processing using val-
ley degree of freedom, the ﬁrst important step is the genera-
tion of a superposition of two valleys as |ψ0∝an}bracketri}ht=1/√
2(|K∝an}bracketri}ht+
|K′∝an}bracketri}ht), which is optically achieved by linearly polarized exci-
tation, and can be detected by a strongly linearly polarized
emission [ 84–86]. For practical considerations in monolayer
TMDCs, the energy of optical excitation may not be exactly
the same as the energy of electronic transitions [ 85], suggest-
ing that it is feasible to tune the valley dynamics through th e
exciton-ﬁeld detuning. For our simulation, we use the param -
eters: exciton energy at zero-ﬁeld E0=1.7 eV [ 5], Lande
factor g=−4.25 [87], width parameter Γ=10−4eV [22], ex-
change induced scattering time τeh=50 ps [ 4,22], phonon-
assisted scattering time τph=1/Γph=50 ps [ 88], radiative6

pure dephasing rate γ=5 ps−1[8]. Also we consider a low-
intensity incident pulse gξ=1 meV [ 58,89], in which the
optical coupling strength is signiﬁcantly smaller than the ex-
citon energy. These are typical values for bright excitons i n
monolayer WSe 2. In the following, we will demonstrate the
control of valley dynamical evolution, by adjusting the det un-
ing∆ξand external magnetic ﬁeld.
A. Valley dynamical optimization: reducing the evolution t ime
We investigate the mechanism for reducing the evolution
time of valley dynamics by means of the detuning ∆ξand ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld. Our aim is to ﬁnd the optimal situation
in which the valley dynamical evolution time clinches tight est
to the QSL time. For this, we ﬁrst show the ratio τm/τas a
function of the actual evolution time τand detuning∆Kfor
four ratios of∆K′over∆K[Fig. 2]. To simultaneously exhibit
the coherence eﬀect of valley dynamics, we obtain the valley
coherence time τC≈0.8 ps (see the purple circles in Fig. 2),
which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental re-
sults in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy [ 8,25]. As
the evolution time exceeds 0.8 ps, there is essentially no va lley
coherence behavior in the dynamical process, with C(ρ)≈0.
Overall, we ﬁnd that the ratio τm/τdrops quickly with time
after a period of stabilization and eventually reaches the m in-

imum value. Larger ratios emerge in the coherent region
(τ<0.8 ps), suggesting that valley coherence plays a crucial
role in driving the actual evolution path to converge to the
geodesic path. Especially, when using a symmetric excitati on
with∆K=∆ K′[Fig. 2(c)], the ratio τm/τremains stable as
changing the detuning ∆K, referring to the system evolving es-
sentially along the geodesic path in the coherent region. Ho w-
ever, when using an asymmetric excitation with ∆K/nequal∆K′
[Figs. 2(a),2(b) and 2(d)], the ratio τm/τdecreases signif-
icantly in the coherent region with the increase of detuning
∆K, which indicates a deviation between the actual evolution
path and the geodesic path.
As time goes on, the ratio τm/τdecreases further in the in-
coherent region ( τ>0.8 ps). This indicates that the actual evo-
lution path further deviates from the geodesic path in the ab -
sence of valley coherence. Also, we ﬁnd that the ratio τm/τin
Fig.2(a) exhibits the identical behavior with that in Fig. 2(d),
in which, the ratio at the ﬁnal state ( τ=3 ps) can be dropped
to 0.4. This is attributed to the fact that the dynamical beha vior
of ratioτm/τis mainly dominated by the detuning di ﬀerence
∆d. That is, in Figs. 2(a) and 2(d), the detuning di ﬀerences
are the same, with ∆d=∆ K, though the ratios of ∆K′over
∆Kare not the same. Remarkable, when the detuning di ﬀer-
ence∆d=0 [Fig. 2(c)], there is an optimal valley dynamical
evolution, where the system evolves along a path closest to t he
geodesic path, accompanied with the largest ratio τm/τ≈0.75
at the ﬁnal state. In this situation, the ratio τm/τexhibits a
favourable robustness to the detuning ∆K. In practice, as long
as symmetric excitation is satisﬁed, the valley dynamics ca n7
travel along a path that takes the least time.
We next investigate the control of valley dynamics in the
presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld. Note that in this sit-
uation, the optical excitation mode and the external magnet ic
ﬁeld together determine the magnitude of the detuning dif-
ference∆d. For completeness, we consider two types of op-
tical excitation modes with symmetric excitation [Figs. 3(a)
and 3(b)] and asymmetric excitation [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)].
From Figs. 3(a) and 3(c), we ﬁnd that the ratio τm/τunder
symmetric excitation exhibit a contrary dependence on the
magnetic ﬁeld as compare to that under asymmetric excita-
tion. Speciﬁcally, for the symmetric excitation [Fig. 3(a)], the
ratioτm/τis moderately suppressed as the magnetic ﬁeld in-
creases. Note that, the dynamical behavior of ratio τm/τat
B=0 matches almost that at B=1 T, see the black cir-
cle in Fig. 3(a). In contrast, for the asymmetric excitation
[Fig. 3(c)], the magnetic e ﬀect leads to an enhancement in the
ratioτm/τ, which eﬀectively pushes the evolution path to ap-
proach the geodesic path. The opposite dependence of ratio
τm/τon magnetic ﬁeld in Figs. 3(a) and 3(c) is attributed to
the contrary contribution of valley splitting ∆Eto the detun-
ing diﬀerence∆dunder symmetric and asymmetric excitations
within the parameters considered. That is, by considering t he
detuning∆K=5 meV , the detuning di ﬀerence∆drises from 0
to 2.47 meV under symmetric excitation, with the applicatio n
of an external magnetic ﬁeld ranging from 0 to 10 T. How-
ever, under asymmetric excitation, the detuning di ﬀerence∆d
decays from 2.5 meV to 0.04 meV . The magnetic ﬁeld can be
used as an additional e ﬀective knob in reducing the evolution
time.
Figures 3(b) and 3(d) show the synergistic e ﬀect of detun-
ing and magnetic ﬁeld on the ratio τm/τ. Clearly, for the
symmetric excitation [Fig. 3(b)], the magnetic e ﬀect always
lowers the ratio τm/τwithin the considered detuning range
(0∼10 meV). For the asymmetric excitation [Fig. 3(d)], the
magnetic ﬁeld has a weak inﬂuence on the ratio τm/τwhen
the detuning∆Kless than 4 meV . As the detuning ∆Kin-
creases beyond 4 meV , the presence of magnetically-induced
valley splitting∆Econtributes to the suppression of detun-
ing diﬀerence∆d, which eﬀectively improves the ratio τm/τ
at strong magnetic ﬁelds. Furthermore, from the contour lin es
of Figs. 3(b) and 3(d), we ﬁnd that larger ratios emerge in the
region surrounded by the green contour line. This is because
the detuning diﬀerence∆din this region approaches zero, be-
ing signiﬁcantly smaller than those in other regions. The sy n-
ergistic eﬀect of detuning and magnetic ﬁeld on the valley dy-
namics opens up further possibility for reducing the evolut ion
time.
B. Valley dynamical optimization: enhancing the evolution
speed
We show the average evolution speed ¯ v(τ) of valley dynam-
ics as a function of detunings ∆Kand∆K′atB=0 [Fig. 4(a)]
andB=5 T [Fig. 4(b)]. In the absence of magnetic ﬁeld
[Fig. 4(a)], the system evolves most slowly under symmetric
excitation [see the green dashed line in Fig. 4(a)], in which,

τ=0 toτ=4 ps as a function of detunings ∆Kand∆K′atB=0 (a)
andB=5 T (b). The green dashed lines denote average evolution
speed ¯ v(τ) when the detuning di ﬀerence∆d=0. The pink (black)
circles in (a) and (b) mark the minimum (maximum) evolution s peed
¯v(τ)|min(max) . Blue double arrows in (a) and (b) denote the orienta-
tions where the detuning di ﬀerence∆dincreases. The scatterplots of
average evolution speed ¯ v(τ) with respect to the detuning di ﬀerence

the maximum evolution speed ¯ v(τ)|max.
the evolution speed ¯ v(τ) is essentially constant with changing
the detuning∆ξ. Remarkable, we ﬁnd that a large detuning
diﬀerence∆dfavors the the acceleration of valley dynamics.
As the detuning diﬀerence∆dgrows from 0 to 10 meV [see the
blue double arrows in Fig. 4(a)], the evolution speed ¯ v(τ) can
be boosted from 0.25 to 0.5, giving a noticeable rise, cf. the
black and pink circles in Fig. 4(a). Note that, there are two po-
sitions where the detuning di ﬀerence∆dis the largest, leading
to the same evolution speed [see two pink circles in Fig. 4(a)].
In the presence of magnetic ﬁeld [Fig. 4(b)], the green dashed
line corresponding to the detuning di ﬀerence∆d=0 shifts
to the right, which leads to the maximum evolution speed
¯v(τ)|maxoccurring only at the position of ∆K′−∆K=10 meV
[see the pink circle in Fig. 4(b)]. From the condition under
which the maximum evolution speed arises in both Figs. 4(a)
and4(b), we emphasize that the asymmetric excitation is crit-
ical to contribute to a fast valley dynamical evolution.
We further explore the relationship between the evolution
speed ¯ v(τ) and the detuning di ﬀerence∆datB=0 [Fig. 4(c)]
andB=5 T [Fig. 4(d)]. As the detuning di ﬀerence∆din-
creases from the minimum to the maximum, the color of data
consequently transforms from blue to yellow, accompanied b y
a gradual narrowed speed range corresponding to the same de-
tuning diﬀerence. Overall, we ﬁnd that the system is inclined
to evolve rapidly in the case with a large detuning di ﬀerence
∆d. Meanwhile, since the detuning di ﬀerence can be further8

increased by the valley splitting ∆E, there is an enhancement
in the maximum evolution speed at B=5 T versus the one at
zero magnetic ﬁeld, cf. the red circles in Fig. 4(c) and 4(d).
We also show the dynamical evolution of population im-
balance (i.e. δρ=ρK−ρK′), for ﬁve ratios of ∆K′over∆Kat
B=0 [Fig. 5(a)] and B=5 T [Fig. 5(b)]. For the symmetric
excitation at zero magnetic ﬁeld [Fig. 5(a)], due to an initial
coherent superposition of excitonic states with the same po p-
ulation in the KandK′valleys, the dynamical evolution of
ρKandρK′perfectly matches [see the black line in Fig. 5(a)].
While for the asymmetric excitation, the detuning di ﬀerence
∆dleads to incongruous dynamical behaviors of ρKandρK′.
Regarding the case of ∆K>∆K′, the population imbalance δρ
increases from zero to the maximum when the time less than 1
ps. After that, it drops over a long period of time until reach es
the minimum [see the blue and red curves in Fig. 5(a)]. The
underlying physics can be understood as follows. The cou-
pling between the TMDC and laser ﬁeld leads to a coherent
transfer of excitonic population from the excitonic state |ξ∝an}bracketri}ht
to the ground state |0∝an}bracketri}ht. Since we consider the two coupling
strengths gKandgK′are the same, the larger detuning ∆Kdis-
favors the coherent transfer compare to the smaller one, whi ch
consequently results in ρKdecaying slower than ρK′in the
initial. However, aﬀected by the intervalley scattering and ra-
diative recombination of excitons, the unequal distributi on of
excitonic population between the KandK′valleys is consider-
ably quenched, giving a reduction to the population imbalan ce
δρ. Considering the dynamical equilibrium of the system, an
asymmetric excitation with ∆K>∆K′enables the coupling ofthe TMDC to laser ﬁeld in K′valley to be more e ﬃcient than
that in Kvalley, so that the K′valley holds eventually more
excitonic populations. In contrast, when using an asymmetr ic
excitation with∆K<∆K′, the population imbalance δρhas an
opposite dynamical evolution [see the pink and green curves
in Fig. 5(a)].
In the presence of magnetic ﬁeld, the dynamical evolu-
tion of population imbalance δρunder symmetric excitation
varies from that at zero magnetic ﬁeld [cf. the black lines in
Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)]. The population imbalance δρinitially un-
dergoes slight ﬂuctuation around the zero and then grows to
its maximum over time. This variation arises from the com-
bined eﬀect of the detuning di ﬀerence and asymmetric inter-
valley scattering on valley dynamics, both of which are in-
duced by the valley splitting. Speciﬁcally, since the Kvalley
is the lower one in energy, the asymmetric intervalley scat-
tering pushes more excitonic populations to transfer to the K
valley. However, in the initial stage of valley dynamics, th e
detuning diﬀerence∆dslows down the coherent transfer from
the state|K′∝an}bracketri}htto the state|0∝an}bracketri}ht, which is responsible for the slight
dropping of population imbalance δρwhen the time less than
1 ps. Also, under asymmetric excitation, the dynamical evo-
lutions of population imbalance δρshift upward with respect
to those at zero magnetic ﬁeld, since the intervalley scatte r-
ing inhibits the incoherent transfer of excitons from Kvalley
toK′valley in the presence of magnetically-induced valley
splitting [cf. the green, pink, red and blue curves in Figs. 5(a)
and5(b)].
C. Two optimal schemes: intrinsic distinction and practica l
application
In this subsection, we further explore the intrinsic distin c-
tion between two types of control schemes of valley dynam-
ics. Beneﬁting from our dynamical analysis of excitonic pop -
ulation [Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)], we ﬁnd that the optimal control
devoted to the reduction of the evolution time [Fig. 2(c)], re-
quires that population imbalance δρconverges to zero [see the
black line in Fig. 5(a)], in which the detuning di ﬀerence is
the smallest [see the purple circle in Fig. 5(a)]. Hence, it is
essential to reduce the evolution time of valley dynamics by
limiting the detuning di ﬀerence. In the absence of magnetic
ﬁeld, the symmetric excitation with ∆K=∆ K′leads to a con-
sequence of detuning di ﬀerence∆d=0. While in the presence
of magnetic ﬁeld, the valley splitting e ﬀectively quenches the
detuning diﬀerence arising from asymmetric excitation. We
further show the actual evolution length L(ρ0,ρτ) of valley
dynamics at B=0 [Fig. 5(c)] and B=5 T [Fig. 5(d)]. It can
be found that the actual evolution length of the valley dynam -
ics is the shortest where the detuning di ﬀerence is the smallest
[see the black curve in Fig. 5(c) and red curve in Fig. 5(d)]. To
facilitate the understanding, we plot a schematic to illust rate
this dynamical path [Fig. 6(a)], in which the system evolves
from an initial state |ψ0∝an}bracketri}htalong a smooth curve to reach the tar-
get state|ψτ∝an}bracketri}ht, i.e., a path that converges towards the geodesic
path.

ﬁnd that a faster dynamical evolution [see the red circle in
Fig. 4(d)] leads to a signiﬁcant population imbalance δρ[see
the green curve in Fig. 5(b)], in which, the detuning di ﬀer-
ence is the largest [see the yellow circle in Fig. 5(b)]. In
the absence of magnetic ﬁeld, the asymmetric excitation wit h
∆K/nequal∆K′induces an emerging of detuning di ﬀerence. In ad-
dition, the detuning di ﬀerence can be further enhanced by the
synergistic eﬀect of the zero-ﬁeld detuning and valley split-
ting. Also, with the increase of detuning di ﬀerence∆d, the
evolution path of valley dynamics is accordingly lengthene d,
thereby distancing it from the geodesic path [see the green
curves in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d)]. This can be understood as fol-
lows: The perfectly equivalent initial distribution of exc itonic
population ( δρ=0) fails to match the energy level conﬁgura-
tion (∆d/nequal0), which pushes the system to take a fast evolution
to overcome this mismatch, accompanied by a pronounced ex-
citonic population redistribution between the KandK′val-
leys. For completeness, we show the schematic to illustrate
the dynamical path with a greater evolution speed [Fig. 6(b)],
in which the system evolves along a complex curve, i.e., a path
that departs from the geodesic path.
Next, we demonstrate the practical application of two opti-mal control schemes of valley dynamics in the system ﬁdelity
Fand valley polarization η. In the transmission of quantum
information, there are unavoidable errors, and the researc h on
the problem of information correction has accordingly been
arisen. The investigation of the dynamical decay of system
ﬁdelity may help us understand the causes of errors related
to various parameters in quantum operation, and contribute
to the improved algorithms. In general, the ﬁdelity was orig i-
nally introduced as a transition probability between two st ates,
Ft=Tr(√ρ0ρt√ρ0)1
2[74,90]. Since the linearly polarized
excitation generates an initial pure state, the ﬁdelity can be re-
duced asFt=/radicalbig
∝an}bracketle{tψ0|ρt|ψ0∝an}bracketri}ht=/radicalbig
Tr(ρ0ρt) [34,35]. Figure 6(c)
shows the relationship between the system ﬁdelity Fand the
ratioτm/τfromτ=0 toτ=10 ps. For completeness, we
consider ﬁve ratios of ∆K′over∆K. Firstly, we ﬁnd a sharp
drop in the ﬁdelity Fas the ratioτm/τdecreases. After that,
the ﬁdelityFholds stability and then recovers the drop. High
value of ﬁdelity emerges accompanied by a large ratio, indi-
cating that there is a weak information loss where the system
evolves along a path taking less time. Note that, a larger de-
tuning diﬀerence allows the ﬁdelity Fto hold stability over
a wider range [see the blue circle ( ◦) and green diamond ( ⋄)
markers in Fig. 6(c)], which eﬀectively suppress information
loss in the process of actual evolution path deviating from t he
geodesic path. The close association between system ﬁdelit y
Fand ratioτm/τindicates that information loss in the valley
dynamical evolution can be prevented by pushing the actual
evolution time to converge to the QSL time.
The valley polarization is a useful feature for signal reado ut
of valley information, manifested by the photoluminescenc e
(PL) spectra with the opposite circularly polarized emissi ons
(σ+andσ−), i.e.,η=(Iσ+−Iσ−)/(Iσ++Iσ−) [4], where Iσ+
andIσ−are the PL intensities of the σ+andσ−components,
respectively. General approaches for creating and manipul at-
ing valley polarization, such as external magnetic ﬁeld and in-
tense circularly polarized excitation [ 5,19], were developed to
spread out the valleytronic application. Figure 6(d) shows the
relationship between the valley polarization ηand evolution
speed ¯ v(τ) from the∆K′=0 to∆K′=4∆K. Note that, there
is no initial valley polarization with respect to the initia l co-
herent superposition of excitoninc states we considered. W ith
ﬁxing the detuning ∆K, we ﬁnd that the valley polarization η
can be generated and further enhanced as the evolution speed
¯v(τ) increases. In addition, with the increase of detuning ∆K,
though the evolution speed is e ﬀectively raised, it does not au-
tomatically signal that the valley polarization is strengt hened
consequently, cf. the red plus ( +) and black cross (×) markers
in Fig. 6(d). Nevertheless, we emphasize that the fast evolv-
ing valley dynamics might yield some insights for enhancing
valley polarization.
IV . CONCLUSIONS
To endow an explicit optimal control scheme of valley dy-
namics, we construct a comprehensive model that incorpo-
rates both intra- and intervalley channels of excitons in mo no-
layer WSe 2, and simultaneously take the light-matter inter-10
action into account. In light of the geometric QSL theory,
we propose two optimal control schemes for optimally tun-
ing valley dynamics, which are respectively devoted to redu ce
the evolution time of reaching the target state, and to boost
the evolution speed over a period of time. We reveal that the
detuning diﬀerence has an essential inﬂuence on the imple-
mentation of dynamical optimization, allowing to control t he
evolution path of valley dynamics by means of the optical ex-
citation mode and external magnetic ﬁeld. Also, we demon-
strate that two optimal control schemes may o ﬀer insight into
maintaining high ﬁdelity in the information transmission, as
well as boosting valley polarization, respectively. The e ﬀect
of magnetic ﬁeld induced valley Zeeman splitting has been
also discussed.
As a remark, though the two types of schemes ask di ﬀerent
requirements for the detuning di ﬀerence, the physical sources
underlying them are not contradictory. This a ﬀords to tune
valley dynamics in various perspective for diversiﬁed targ ets,
since the resulting control closely depends on the performancemeasure to be optimized [ 69]. For practical considerations,
our results show that the optical excitation with resonance de-
tuning (i.e.∆ξ=0) is not necessary for reducing the actual
evolution time of valley dynamics. This relaxes the require -
ment for the coupling performance between the TMDC and
optical cavity. Additionally, the nonuniqueness of a bona ﬁ de
metric deﬁning the geodesic reminds to reinforce further ex -
ploration of improved QSL bounds [ 66]. Our research gener-
alizes the practical application of QSL theory, and also pro -
vides an eﬀective strategy for optically regulating the dynam-
ical evolution in valley qubit.
