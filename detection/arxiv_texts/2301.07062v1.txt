ABSTRACT. Accurate design of  labelled oligo probes for the  detection of miRNA  biomarkers  by 
Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)  may improve  the exploitation of the plasmonic 
enhancement. T his work , thus, critically investigates the role of probe labelling  configuration on 
the performance of  SERS based bioassays for  miRNA  quantitation . To this aim, highly efficient 
SERS substrates based on Ag -decorated porous silicon/PDMS membranes are functionalized 
according to two different bioassays relying on a one -step or two -step hybridization of the target 
miRNA with oligonucleotide probes. The detection configuration is varied, exploring the impact 
of the position of the Raman reporter along the oligo sequence and of the reporter identity on 
bioassay sensitivity . In the high miRNA concentration regime (100-10 nM ), a significantly 
increased SERS intensity is detected when the reporters are located closer to the plasmonic surface 
compared to farther probe labelling positions. Counterintuit ively, a  levelling -off of the SERS 
intensity from the two configuration is instead recorded at low miRNA concentration. Such effect  
 
 2 is explained by an increased contribution of  Raman  hot spot to the whole SERS signal, as 
confirmed by simulations of the ele ctric near field for a simplified model of the Ag nanostructures. 
The beneficial effect of reducing the reporter -to-surface distance is however partially retained for 
the two -step hybridization assay thanks to the less sterically hindered environment in wh ich the 
second hybridization occurs.  The study thus demonstrates that the limit of detection of the assay 
can be lowered by tuning the probe labelling position, but sheds  at the same time light on the 
complexity of the bionanointerfaces in SERS  and on the multiple factors affecting bioassay 
sensitivity.  
Introduction  
Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) -based sensors provide excellent results in the 
detection of biomolecules aimed to the easy and rapid diagnostic and follow -up monitoring of 
biomarkers .1 Besides the development of tailored SERS active platforms , thanks to the improved 
knowledge on the SERS enhancement mechanisms and to the increased availability of synthetic 
procedures for  Raman  hot-spot engineering, the relevance of the functionalization strategy  of the 
plasmonic nanostructures to enhance the sensitivity and the specificity of the detection has been 
fully recognized.2 Actually, the use of specific capture probes anchored to the nanoparticles surface 
is a widely  adopted approach for biomarker det ection, especially moving towards the ir analysis  in 
complex mixtures such as biofluids  or food extracts .3,4 In such  a framework , the direct detection 
of the analyte requires the processing of the complex spectral profiles by chemometric/machine 
learning tools5 and is often  challenging if very low concentrations need to be addressed. Moreover, 
the use of multiple probes in sandwich or competitive assays allowed introducing Raman reporters 
preserving a label -free approach.6,7 The target biomolecule coul d thus be detected without the need  
 
 3 of chemical modifications, but with an improved sensitivity thanks to the very high Raman cross 
section of the reporter, possibly excited in electronic resonance Raman conditions.  
Among the multitude of interesting appl ications in biomedicine, microRNA (miRNAs) detection 
strategies are being deeply investigate d.8 Such short non -coding RNA strands, involved in the 
regulation of several biological processes through the control of gene expression, are widely 
studied as markers of cancer disease.9 Indeed, the alteration of the concentrations of specific 
miRNA sequen ces in tissues and body fluids has been related to the onset of cancer pathologies10. 
Thus, miRNA profiling has a great potential for early tumo ur diagnosis. In such framework, SERS 
sensors provide good sensitivity, specificity, wide dynamic ranges and m ultiplexing capability at 
lower cost and in shorter time with respect to traditional nucleic acid analytical techniques6,11. 
Complementary DNA probes have been used to functionalize the plasmonic nanostructures . 
Recently , new protocols including in situ amplification steps relying both on the use of DNA 
cleaving or replicating enzymes or on chip PCR have appeared12 Other works reported enzyme -
free approaches13, even based on HCR ( Hybridization Chain Reaction ) amplification11 or the use 
of SERS tags able to bind the captured miRNA sequence7,14. In such cases , the reported limits of 
detection are lowered down to the pM -fM concentration range, suitable for miRNA profiling in 
blood plasma8, but the procedures are significantly complicated and  feature d by increased  costs . 
Actually, the use of Raman reporters in miRNA detection assays is widespread and different 
probes were designed bearing the reporter in different position with respect to the plasmonic 
surface, such as in the case of ON -OFF assays bas ed on the plasmonic enhancement variation upon 
a change of the surface to molecule distance in the opening of loop probes15; however,  a critical  
comparison between different configurations was not considered. Indeed, an improvement of the 
analyte detection limits is envisaged if the ‘plasmonic surface - Raman reporter ’ distance is  
 
 4 reduced, due to the strong increase of SERS electromagnetic enhanc ement when the fluorophore -
NPs spacing is decreased , together with  a potential quenching of the deleterious 
photoluminescence yield  of the  reporter .  
In this work , we tune the performance of a SERS based assay for the label -free detection of miR-
222 throug h a detailed study of different detection configurations in which the distance of the 
reporter from the nanostructured surface is varied. In order to widen the range of achievable 
spacings both a one -step and a two -step hybridization assays are tested usin g Ag -decorated porous 
silicon nanostructures as SERS active platform. The behaviour of each configuration versus miR -
222 concentration is critically analysed and some unexpected trends, such as a reduced distance 
dependence of the SERS amplification at low  target concentration, are understood in terms of the 
plasmonic properties of the SERS substrate  and probe -target interaction at the silver surface .  
Experimental Procedures  
Chemicals  and materials  
DL-Dithiothreitol (98.0% DTT), acetic acid (99.0%), bovine serum albumin (BSA, IgG free), 
polyethylene glycol sorbitan monolaurate (Tween), sodium acetate (99.0%), sodium chloride 
(99.5%), tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS),  ethanol (>99.8%), 
ethylened iaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 99.4%), saline sodium citrate (SSC, sterile stock 20x, 300 
mM trisodium citrate, 3 M NaCl), sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (BioUltra, 10%, SDS), 3,30 
,5,50 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB),  silver nitrate,  heat-inactivated fetal b ovine serum . All of the 
DNA and RNA oligos were from Sigma Aldrich,  Milan, IT, and from Integrated DNA 
technologies, Leuven, BE. HF was from Carlo Erba, Milan, IT. The PDMS pre -polymer and curing 
agent (Sylgard 184) were from Dow Corning  and the silicon wa fers from Sil’tronix Silicon  
 
 5 Technologies, Archamps , France . The Illustra MicroSpin G -25 columns were from GE Healthcare 
(Fisher Scienti fic, Illkirk, FR). The water used during each step was Milli -Q™ dispensed from a 
DirectQ -3UV (Merck -Millipore, Milan, IT ) and sterilized.  
Ag-Porous silicon -PDMS SERS platforms synthesis.  
Ag-porous silicon -polyd imethylsiloxane membranes (Ag -PSD) were prepared according to a 
previously reported procedure16. Briefly, boron -doped Si wafers (34 mΩ cm resistivity ) were 
electr ochemically etched in 2 0 : 20 : 60 - HF/H 2O/CH 3CH 2OH solutions , with a current density of  
125 mA/cm2 for 30 s. The obtained mesoporous membranes, featuring a 2 m thickness  and 80% 
porosity, were then partially lifted off by means of a second electrochemical attack  with a 2% HF 
nearly ethanolic solution , at a current  density of 4 mA/cm2 for 95 s , and transferred on partially 
crosslinked polyd imethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane s obtained by mixing in  a 10:1 weight ratio  
the oligomer and the curing agent , respectively . After a refresh in 5% HF aqueous solution and 
thorough  rinse in ethanol, the obtained  substrate was dried and finally dipped in 10-2 M silver 
nitrate aqueous solution, supplemented with HF up to a concentration of  0.0025%. Indeed, by this 
step, the silver nanoparticles  (NPs)  were in situ  synthesized , by exploiting the reducing properties 
of Si-Hx (x=1 -3) groups covering the surface of freshly etched porous silicon  (pSi) . After an 
incubation  time of 4 s, the Ag-PSD substrates  were rinsed in dH 2O and gently dried und er N2 flux. 
 
Morphological characterization  of the SERS substrate  
Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy  (FESEM)  was performed to assess the morphology 
of the synthesized silver nanostructures. Due to the poor conduction by the PDMS support, 
samples were covered by a copper grid to allow elect ron discharging. Images were acquired by a   
 
 6 Zeiss Supra 40 FESEM using  20 µm aperture  and 3 keV primary beam with secondary electrons 
analysis .  
 
Plasmonic properties simulation  
A simplified system of the SERS active substrates consisting in Ag hemispheres dimers on pSi 
was modelled by 3D Finite Element Method  (FEM) . At this aim the Electromagnetic Waves, 
Frequency Domain  module of the COMSOL Multiphysics software (version 5.1) was exploited. 
The exc itation laser was simulated through a background electric field, E bk = 1 V/m  with a 
polarization plane along the axis of the two AgNPs at different wavelength, to study the coupling 
of their surface plasmons in resonant conditions. The elect ric near-field intensity in stationary 
conditions was calculated for representative NPs diameter -gap size combinations and analy sed 
inside and outside the inter -particle gap, in order to get insights concerning  their impact on the 
differences in the miRNAs detection highlighted in the subsequent experiments . 
One-step and two -step hybridization assays  
After a BSA blocking step aimed to reduce non -specific binding, the prepared Ag -PSD solid 
substrates were functionalized for miR -222 detection according to two  previously optimized 
protocols6. In detail, as for the one -step hybridization assay, a 5’ thiol modified DNA probe (probe -
222, 5’ -C6SH -ACCCAGTAGCCAGATGTAGCT -3’) complementary to miR -222 sequence 
(5’AGCUACAUCUGGCUACUGGGU -3’) was immobilized on the SERS s ubstrate surface 
overnight in Tris -EDTA 1 M NaCl (TE NaCl pH 7.5) buffer at 4 µM concentration. A shorter 
sequence, consisting of the first 11 nucleotides of probe -222 (half1, 5’ -C6SH -ACCCAGTAGC - 
 
 7 3’) was instead used as a capture probe for the two -step hybridization  assay. The same 
immobilization conditions were employed, except for the concentration that was lowered to 2 µM. 
miR-222 hybridization was then performed in SSC 5x supplemented with 0.05% tween20. A 
Raman reporter -labelled miRNA (miRNA -R) was employed during the one -step hybridization 
assay . The unlabelled miRNA was instead used in the two -step assay , since a sensitive detection 
was allowed in the second hybridization step performed in SSC 5x supplemented with 0.05% 
tween20  and 1% BSA using  a labelled half2 probe (5’ -CAGATGTAGCT ) complementary to the 
unpaired part of the miRNA sequence. After each functionalization step three washings of 5 
minutes were performed in appropriate buffers, as detailed elsewhere7. 
Detection confi gurations  
Four configurations were studied. In detail, miR -222 was modified with a Raman reporter (R) at 
either the 5’ or 3’ termin us of the sequence in order to achieve significantly different reporter -to-
surface distances. Similarly, the half2 probe was labelled either at 3’ or 5’ end . Two widely 
employed Raman reporters, Cyanine 3  (Cy3) and  Rhodamine 6G  (R6G ), were used . UCSF 
Chimera package (1.16) was employed to calculate the dimensions of the probe to estimate the 
reporter -to-surface distances  for each configuration  and to  prepare the graphical images17. The 
performance of the configurations was investigated by the analysis of different miR -222 
concentrations (100 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, 10 nM, 5 nM, 2.5 nM, 1 nM, 0.5 n M, 0.25 nM, 0.1 nM) 
in buffer solutions, for the selected Raman reporters ( 8 different combinations as a whole). For 
each configuration the experiments were repeated  at least  three times.  
 
  
 
 8 SERS analyses  
All the SERS analyses were performed using a Renishaw InVia Raman microscope, equipped with 
a 514.5 nm laser line. The measurements were collected in backscattering configuration with a 
100X long working distance objective (NA 0.75) and the laser power (10 0 mW) reduced to the 
0.05 % through neutral density filters. A 5%-defocalization of the laser spot was applied to keep 
the power density as low as possible to avoid any oligonucleotide degradation. Each sample was 
analysed by recording a map of 100 spectra  distributed over a grid of ca. 45 μm x 45 μm with a 
step size of 5 μm. The total acquisition time was 8 s for each spectrum, divided in 4 accumulations. 
The spectra were then analysed by a combination of the HyperSpec R package18 and the Renishaw 
software WiRe 3.4. In detail, the baseline subtracted data set and the avera ge spectrum of each 
map were calculated on R, while a deconvolution of selected regions of the spectra was carried out 
on WiRe 3.4 to obtain the integrated area value of specific Raman reporter bands for each recorded 
spectrum. The intra -substrate variabil ity was expressed in terms of Relative Standard Deviation 
(RSD).  
The obtained  integrated areas were used to build calibration curves (vibrational band area vs. 
miR-222 concentration) for the different configuration -reporter combinations. Linear regression  
was performed and the L imit of Detection (LOD) of the different methods were calculated  as the 
concentration corresponding to the average value of  control sample s increased by  three standard 
deviation s, as described in the literature.19 
3. Results and Discussion  
Ag-decorated porous silicon -PDMS substrates  (Ag-PSD)  were previously demonstrated as 
sensitive and reliable SERS platforms featured by a homogenous distribution of densely packed  
 
 9 silver nanostructures16 (a representative FESEM micr ograph is reported in Fig ure S1). In this 
study, Ag -PSD were thus selected for the comparison of the different detection configurations in 
the framework of miRNA analysis. Fi gure 1 depicts the investigated configurations, showing the 
last hybridization ste p of a one -step and a two -step hybridization assay.  
 
 
Figure 1. Scheme of the four detection configurations a) one -step assay: a fully complementary 
probe immobilized on the AgNPs binds the miRNA, which is labelled with a Raman reporter 
either at the 5’ or 3’ termin us; b) two -step assay: a first half -complementary probe (half1) 
immobilized on the AgNPs binds the unlabelled miRNA and the reporter is attached either at the 
5’ or 3’ termin us of the half2 probe. The estimated reporter -to-surface distance for each 
configuration is highlighted. Note that NPs and oligos size are not to scale.  
Concerning the one -step assay , the miRNA is recognized by a fully complementary DNA probe 
immobilized at surface of Ag NPs  via a thiol group and two configurations are possible: one with 
the miRNA modified with a Raman reporter at the 5’ terminus (miRNA  R-5’), the other with the 
 
 
 10 Raman reporter at the  3’ terminus  (miRNA  R-3’) (Fig ure 1a), namely bearing the  reporter at the 
farth est end of the sequence or close to the NPs surface. The two -step assay, instead, has a great 
potential for a label -free detection in real samples, since the target miRNA does not require 
chemical modification, as its specific recognition and detection are  accomplished by two probes, 
each complementary to half of its sequence: the thiolated “half1” probe is anchored to the NPs 
surface and captures the miRNA from the sample, while  the sensitive detection occurs thanks to 
the subsequent hybridization of the “ half2” probe conjugated to a Raman reporter. In analogy with 
the one -step assay , two configurations are available, having the reporter at the 5’ (half2  R-5’, close 
to the surface) or 3’ ( half2  R-3’, far from the surface) termin us of the half2 probe (Fig ure 1b). 
Rhodamine 6G (R6G)  and Cyanine 3 (Cy3) were identified as a convenient  set of commercial 
reporters  allowing comparable sensitivities  thanks to their possible excitation under  electronic 
resonance  conditions around the laser wavelength used in the experiments  (optical  absorption 
occurs at λmax = 520 and 530 nm  for Cy3 and R6G, respectively ). 
In silico calculations were performed to obtain an estimation of the oligonucleotide length and thus 
of the distance of the reporter molecule from the surface  The maximum spacing was approximately  
7.5 nm for the miRNA  R-5’ and half2  R-3’ configurations, while the lowest one, calculated for 
miRNA  R-3’, was found below 1 nm. Instead, a n intermediate distance of 3.5 nm was considere d 
for the half2 -5’ configuration . All these calculations assumed that the hybridized complex was 
oriented perpendicularly to the  NP surface.  So that , this is a simplified model of DNA -particle and 
DNA -DNA interactions, as it is known that thiolated oligonucleotide monolayers can be arranged 
in tilted strands.20 A slightly shorter distance can be therefore expected. However, big tilt angle 
are unlikely  in the studied system , as it was previously demonstrated that the SERS signal of the 
half2 probe and of probe -222 was almost iden tical6, showing that the ir SERS spectra are dominated  
 
 11 by the vibrational pattern of  nucleobases belong ing to the first part of the two sequence s. This 
suggest no significant tilting is occurring, as more nucleobases of the probe  222 would contribute 
to SERS pattern in case of big tilt angles, due to the reduced distance from the surface.  Further 
complexity is given by the nanostructured surface, compared to a flat metallic one.  
One-step assay: miRNA  R-5’ vs. miRNA  R-3’ 
To compare the SERS performance of  the different configurations, the Ag -PSD substrates were 
then incubated according to the two functionalization protocols with the different miRNA  R-3’/5’ 
and half2  R-3’/5’ sequences, varying the miR -222 concentration in the 100 nM -0.1 nM range. The 
average spectra of SERS maps obtained with the miR -222 R6G -3’/5’ are reported in Fig ure 2. An 
intense R6G vibrational pattern appears in the spectra of the samples incubated with a 100 nM 
miRNA concentratio n, overcoming any mode of the probe -222 down to 10 nM concentration. The 
typical C -C stretching of the xanthene ring at 13 64 and 1646 cm-121 are clearly observed, together 
with all the characteristic bands of R6G, as assigned in Table S1. It is worth men tioning the isolated 
band around 645 cm-1, attributed to the C -C ring in plane bending of the xanthene ring22 modified 
with an additional carboxylic group, due to its remarkable intensity and negligible superposition 
with the DNA probe bands. For this re ason, such mode was selected to track the signal of all the 
R6G -labelled oligonucleotides, also for quantitative purposes. If the high concentration spectra of

the probe -222 according to the one -step hybridization protocol and incubated with different 
concentrations of a) miR -222 R6G -5’ and b) miR -222 R6G -3’. The violet bars highlight two main 
bands of R6G  (647 and 13 64 cm-1). When indicated on the right, the spectra were multiplied by 
the specified factor.  
the two configurations are compared, the miRNA  R6G -3’ SERS signal clearly exhibits a greater 
intensity with respect to the configuration having the reporter far from the NPs surface. Indeed, an 
enhancement of more than 3 times of the fluorophore signal is detected, explained by the increased 
electromagnetic field intensity due to the reduced distance from the NPs surface. Actually, some 
experimental works investigated the distance -dependence of SERS intensity. The greatest drop of 
the plasmonic field intensity was shown to occur in the first nanometres , while for a n increased 
spacing a slower decay was observed. The fastest  decay of the SERS intensity was observed in a 
high spacing resolution study by Masango et al. that reported a signal decrease to the 20% of the 
 
 
 13 “in contact” one at 0.7 nm from the plasmonic surfa ce.23 Different experimental works agree 
instead on a SERS intensity decrease to the 7 -10% of the zero -spacing signal at around 3 -3.5 
nm23,24 and on its further  five-fold decrease when the distance from the enhancing metal surface is 
raised from ⁓0.9 to ⁓7 nm25,26. However, a great variability is documented  in such literature 
reports,  especially concerning the slope of the SERS signal enhancement decrease in close 
proximity of the surface . Indeed, the derived distance -dependence of SERS  enhancement  may var y 
due to  several factors, including the morphology of the employed SERS substrate and the nature 
of the spacing layer. Despite this, based on the available literature and taking into account a slight 
degree of uncertainty related to the orientation and pos ition assumed by the reporter, the three -fold 
enhancement observed for the miRNA  R6G -3’ configuration seems to be a reasonable result.  
Similar conclusions can be drawn for the Cy3 reporter (SERS spectra at different miRNA 
concentrations can be found in Fig ure S2), although the SERS intensity of the two configurations 
seems to differ in most of the cases by a factor higher than 4. The described behaviour  can be 
appreciated by monitoring one of the main  SERS  bands of the indocarbo cyanine molecule , the 
vibrational  mode located at around 146 3 cm-1, attributed to the CH 3 deformation of the ring 
substituents27 (see Table S 1 for a more complete assignment of the vibrational pattern  of Cy3 ). It 
should be finally noted that the distance of the reporter from  the metal surface also affects the 
typical fluorescence of the dye. The raw SERS spectra  of the 5’ configurations  are indeed 
characterized by a strong fluorescence background , yielding a  greater noise  compared to the 3’ 
one (Figure S3) . Such  fluorescence is significantly quenched when the reporter is close to the  metal  
surface.  A contribution of the improved signal -to-noise ratio to the whole SERS intensity increase 
for the 3’ configuration cannot thus be excluded.   
 
 14 As a general trend , it can be further noticed that the difference in terms of SERS intensity between 
the close and far -to-the-surface configurations tends to decrease by lowering the miR -222 
concentration, especially below 10 nM (the SERS spectra of selected concentrations of miRNA - 
R6G -5’ and miRNA  R6G -3’ are superimposed in Figure S 4), sometimes fading  for the lowest 
concentrations. The comparison between the calibration curves obtained for the 3 ’ and 5’ 
configuration s reported in Figure 3 clearly highlight such a phenomenon. This outcome is also 
reflected into the calculated Limit s of Detection (LODs) reported in Table 1. Surprisingly,  the

concentration obtained by SERS mapping of the Ag -PSD substrates functionalized according to 
the one -step assay. a) R6G  and b) Cy 3 were employed as Raman reporters. Black squares represent 
the close -to-the-surface (3’) configuration, while red circles the far -from -the-surface (5’) one. The 
error bars correspond to the standard deviations.  
 
 
 15 LOD appear s comparable  for the Cy3 -labelled m iRNAs and even  slightly lower for the miR -222 
R6G -5’ compared to the miR -222 R6G-3’. Such unexpected result depends however on the range 
of concentrations selected for the calculation. Indeed, a linear regime was identified below 25 nM, 
so that for most of the calibration curves the linear regression was performed betw een 10 nM and 
0 nM , including several low concentrations data points.  
Table 1. Limit of detection for the one -step assay performed by exploiting the four different 
configurations along with the miR -222 concentrations used for the linear regression.  
 
These result s suggest a different enhancement mechanism only for the low concentrations, 
inducing the levelling -off of the difference between the two configurations.  
Most likely, different factors could contribute to the observed trend s. First, an influence  of the 
steric hindrance for the miRNA labelled at the 3’ terminal is expected . Such effect could be 
particularly detrimental in the case of low concentrations approaching the values of the 
dissociation constants between probe and miRNA, which are expected  to be in the nM range28. 
Moreover, a second and probably dominant contribution can be ascribed to the SERS -active 
nanostructures themselves. In fact, at high miR -222 concentration it is expected that all the NPs 
are able to provide a sufficient electromagnetic field amplification , through the excitation of their 
Localized Surface Plasmon Resonances (LSPRs) , to observe a SERS signal from the quite large 
population of m iRNA -probe hybrids probed by the laser  beam . In contrast, if few miRNA 
 
 
 16 molecules are captured from the incubation solution, only the most efficient Raman  hot-spots will 
be able to provide the needed enhancement.  
Electromagnetic near field analysis  for Ag -PSD nanostructures  
FEM simulations were performed to corroborate such hypothesis by analysing the electric near -
field (NF) intensity profiles inside and outside the gap of a dimer of Ag hemispheres in contact 
with the pSi surface, which  was selected as sim plified model of the plasmonic nanostructures. 
Based on the morphological parameters extracted from the FESEM analyses of the Ag -PSD 
substrates , different NPs diameters (25-30-35), centred at the average one, were considered for the 
simulations. For each d iameter, gap values were varied between 2 nm and 8 nm, with a 2 nm step. 
Very small gaps (<  2 nm) were excluded from the studied range, as they can  hardly  accommodate 
the probe -miRNA hybrid, even if horizontally adsorbed on the NP surface, while 6 and 8 nm are 
expected to provide enough space  for a successful hybridization. Representative spectra reporting 
the maximum electric NF intensity calculated within  the gap between the Ag hemispheres are 
shown in Figure 4. All the spectra are featured by multiple resonances extending towards 
wavelength s larger than the excitation laser line  when the inter -particle gap size is decreased and 
the particle diameter  is increased, in agreement with the previous literature29,30. The highest NF 
intensity is observed for the longest wavelength resonance, located between 500 and 600 nm, 
depending on the size -gap combinations.  Moreover, it should be noted that most of th e simulated 
dimers present an intense band around the excitation wavelength used for the SERS measurements 
(514.5 nm), supporting the well-known high efficiency of the Ag -PSD substrates under green light 
excitation. Such resonance seems to originate from a  splitting of the main one due to inter -particle 
coupling when the gap becomes smaller and smaller, as suggested by their partial convolution for 
the larger gap – smaller diameter pairs.   
 
 17 Figure 4.  Maximum electric NF intensity calculated within the gap  of a dimer of Ag hemispheres 
on a pSi surface by FEM simulations for different wavelengths and diameter -gap combinations of 
the AgNPs.  The black vertical bar at 514.5 nm represents the  excitation wavelength used for the 
SERS measurements .  
Panel a) and b) in Figure  5 show instead the profiles of the electric NF intensity at 514.5 nm 
extracted at different position within and outside the gap. R = 15 nm and  G = 6 nm were selected 
as the most representative particles radius and gap size for th e investigated system. For what 
concerns  the z profiles,  shown in panel a),  the electric NF decays  by order of magnitudes  moving 
from z = 0 nm (the pSi surface level) to 15 nm. Curves extracted at different x location ( x = 0 
corresponds to the gap centr e) feature different trends only for very short  distances from the pSi  
surface: in such range the highest intensities and the fastest decrease are observed close to the 
AgNP surface (x  = -2, -3 nm), while lower intensities but a slower decay are detected if the profile 
is taken near the gap centr e. The described trend is mor e pronounced when the gap becomes larger , 
 
 
 18 with respect to the NP size (Figure S 5), but , as anticipated, the differences strongly reduce at z  > 
2 nm for all gap -size combinations. The slight variation of the electric NF intensity along the 
interparticle axi s beyond z  = 3 nm can be better appreciated from the x profiles obtained at  different 
z values reported in  panel b) of Figure 5, where the symmetry of the NF intensity distribution with 
respect to the inter -particle gap center  is verified.   
 
Figure 5.  Spatial profiles of the electric NF intensity  calculated within the gap  (G = 6 nm) of a 
dimer of Ag hemispheres  (R = 15 nm)  on a pSi surface by FEM simulations a) along the z direction 
and b) along the x direction. The excitation wavelength was set at 514 .5 nm. The inset in panel a)  
shows a z profile taken outside the gap (at x = -18 nm) .  
 
 
 19 Some significant differences between the electric NF intensities at the gap centr e and edges appear 
again for quite high z values (>  9 nm) , when the distance between the  NPs surfaces is 12 nm. An 
interparticle separation of the order of the particle radius is indeed considered the cut -off beyond 
which interparticle coupling contribution cease to dominate. The inset in panel a) of Figure 5  
finally shows a z profile taken ou tside the gap ( from the top of one of the particles, at  x = -18 nm, 
z from 15 to 30 nm ). Here, as expected , the electric NF intensity is several orders of magnitude 
lower than in the gap and monotonically decreases while the distance from the Ag hemisphere 
increases. It can be concluded that , in the case of a probe -miRNA hybrid in an interparticle gap,  a 
Raman reporter is expected to benefit from a different enhancement depending on its position 
along the probe only if the oligo is bound to the NP  very close to the Ag/ pSi interface . Instead  for 
z ≥ 3 nm, the most likely situation, the electric NF experienced by the dye molecule is nearly 
constant throughout the gap at fixed z. At higher z values, some limited differences may however  
arise due to th e tilted orientation of the hybrids in an upright conformation with respect to the pSi 
surface.  Outside the gap, instead, the SERS enhancement at 7.5 nm from the NP surface is reduced 
to about the 15% of the one observed at 1 nm spacing. The scheme in Figu re 6, representing 
miRNA molecules hybridized to  the probe222 in or outside the gap between two AgNPs  on a pSi 
surface , highlights the difference in the experienced NF intensity that characterizes the reporter in 
the 5’ and 3’ configuration s outside the gap. However, as the electr ic field distribution is rather 
homogenous in the gap between the nanoparticles, the beneficial effects of decreasing the reporter -
to-surface distance are strongly reduced or even cancelled depending on the specific combination 
of NP diameter, gap size and binding site of the probe. It should be in fact underlined that, even if 
limited, the heterogeneity in the morphology of the SERS substrate can obviously affect the 
enhancement of the  SERS  signal obtained  when the reporter at the  5’- terminus of the miRNA  is  
 
 20 located in the gap . Indeed, the reporter  can be even in contact with the neighbouring NP in some 
cases. Unfortunately, the prevalence of the gap contribution to the SERS signal at low miRNA 
concentration does not  allow the expected improvement of the LODs moving from the far - to the 
close -to-the-surface reporter configuration. Though, it should be noted that at the same time, the 
signal is already boosted in the gap for the miRNA  R-5’ configuration at low conce ntration s. As a 
result, the slope of the calibration curve is reduced compared to the high concentration regime.  
 
Figure 6.  Scheme  representing miRNA molecules hybridized to the probe -222 in or outside the 
gap between two AgNPs  on a porous silicon  surface  for both the a) 3’ and b) 5’ configuration s of 
the Raman reporter s.  
A further indication of a distinct origin of the SERS enhancement for the high and low 
concentration s of target miRNA  is indeed provided by the non -linear trend often observed in SERS 
calibration s. In fact, the sensitivity should change if all the particles or only the hot -spots contribute 
to the SERS intensity. Modelling  this variation is a great challenge , due to the strong depend ence 
 
 
 21 of such effects  on the SERS substrate morphology. Nevertheless, some attempts can be found in 
the literature that use non -linear fitting functions, such as the Langmuir or dose -response  
curves31,32. Actually, none of the two models provided a satisfactory fit of the current data, showing 
that adsorption  models are  not always  adequate to describe the trend of the SERS intensity vs. the 
analyte concentration, probably because they do not take into account such hot -spot related effect 
that becomes evident  only for very low concentrations  of the target analyte . It should be mentio ned 
that similar non -linearities were in many cases attributed to the SERS Intensity Fluctuations due 
to single molecule events in the nanomolar and subnanomolar concentration range.1 Namely , it is 
assumed that such fluctuations depend on the motion of the  analyte in and outside the available 
hot-spot, whose volume sharply decreases for increasing enhancement.3 Though, such  phenomena  
shouldn’t be the source of non -linearity  in the presented system , since the functionalization of the 
surface does not allow g reat motion of the involved molecules and the SERS measurements are 
not acquired in solution, where some dynamic equilibrium between bound and free miRNA R5’/3’ 
could establish.  
Two -step assay: half2  R-3’ vs. half2  R-5’ 
Different concentrations of unlabelled miR -222 were incubated on the half1 functionalized Ag -
PSD substrates and afterwards detected through the hybridization with the half2 probe labelled 
with the different reporters both at the 3’ or 5’ termin us. The results of the SERS maps acquire d 
on the described samples are displayed in Figure 7 for the 5’ and 3’ R6G -labelled half2  probe . As 
expected due to the reduced difference in the reporter -to-surface distance (3.5 nm vs. 7.5 instead 
of < 1 nm vs. 7.5 in the case of the labelled miR -222) in the two configurations the SERS intensity 
was only moderately enhanced when the reporter was located close to the AgNPs (generally  around 
or less than 2 times the area of the Raman band of R6G at 647 cm-1 calculated for the 3’ labelling).

Figure 7. Averag e SERS spectra obtained from maps on the Ag -PSD substrate functionalized with 
half1 , exposed to different concentrations of miR -222 and then incubated with a) half2  R6G -3’ 
and b) half2  R6G -5’, according to the two -step hybridization protocol. The  violet bars highlight 
the two main bands of R6G  (at 647 and 1364 cm-1). When indicated on the right, the spectra were 
multiplied by the specified factor.  
Differently from the case of the one -step assay, such enhancement does not fade for concentrations 
around and lower than 5 nM . A close inspection of the  superimposed  average SERS spectra (Figure 
S6 and S7 ) highlights that some differences between the two configurations are preserved in most 
cases also in the nanomolar range for both the R6G and Cy3 reporters . Such trend is also confirmed 
by the calibration curves of SERS area vs. miR -222 concentrations reported in Figure 8, that were 
derived considering the integrated area of the same SERS bands analysed for the one -step assay. 
This outcome is reflected in the calculated LOD s, which result 1506  pM and 357 pM when the 
half2  R6G -3’ and the half2  R6G -5’ are concerned , respectively . An improvement of the sensitivity

of the assay is thus achieved for the two -step assay by moving the reporter towards the nanoparticle 
surface, despite the order of magnitude of the LOD doesn’t change. It should be noted that a similar  
benefit is obtained using the half2 -Cy3, for which the LOD s are 988 nM and 627 pM, as listed in 
Table 2.   
 
 
 
 
 24 Table 2. Limit of detection for the two-step assay performed by exploiting the four different 
configurations along with the miR -222 concentrations used for the linear regression.  
 
Actually, the outcomes  appear to be different from the one detected in the one -step assay, as 
confirmed by the repetition of the experiments. Such discrepancies cannot ho wever depend on a 
diverse electromagnetic enhancement mechanism: hot -spot contribution should again dominate at 
low miR -222 concentration. It can be therefore hypothesized that the y depend on the impact of the  
position of probe/miRNA labelling on the hybri disation efficiency. Indeed, it  is well known that 
steric hindrance effects play a significant role in duplex formation when the hybridization involves 
a surface -immobilized probe , such as in microarrays .33,34 As an example, an excessive packing of 
probe s at the surface is detrimental , since it r esult s in slow  hybrid ization  kinetics and  lowered 
degree of probe/ta rget hybridization.33,35 Moreover, it was observed that the hybridisation yield  
increases when probe -target binding occur s farther from the support surface , due to an improved 
accessibility of the oligonucleotide sequence36 For th is reason spacer  linkers are often  employed  
to increase the distance of the strand and reduce steric interference from the support .36 In such a 
framework, t he presence of a bulky reporter at the close -to-the surface termi nus of the  half2  probe 
or miR -222 is expected to enhance steric hindrance related issues  with respect to the far -from the 
surface configurations . However, if the one step and two step assay are compared, it is immediately 
apparent  that the half2  R-5’/miR -222 hybridization occurs in a less sterically hindered 
environment than the miRNA  R-3’/probe  222 hetero duplex formation. Indeed, in the two step 
 
 
 25 assay, the  second  hybridization takes place at an increased distance from the NP surface.  It is 
therefore reasonable that the observed trends arise from the comb ination of electromagnetic and 
hybridisation efficiency effects: the electromagnetic near field intensity depend ence on  the 
reporter -to-surface distance strongly reduc es in the low concentration regime  for all the tested 
configurations , but the higher LODs for the mi R-222 R-3’ configuration compared  to the miR -222 
R-5’ one are probably ascribable to the severe steric hind rance effects in the first case . It should 
be underlined, that the influence of steric constraints  would probably not be appreciated in the 
absence of the levelling off of the electromagnetic enhancement. Instead,  for the two -step assay, 
where steric issue s are relaxed for the second hybridization step (the one that involves the reporter), 
a slight ly higher SERS intensity is still observed at low miR -222 concentration for the close -to- 
the surface configuration  compared to the 3’ one . It should be noted , indeed , that the inherent lower 
melting temperature of the half1 /miR-222 and miR -222/half2 complexes compared to the longer 
and thus more stable probe222 -miR-222 duplex was previously compensated by the optimization 
of the hybridization conditions7.  
Despite lower than initially expected, due to the described increased contribution of hot -spots to 
the SERS signal observed at low target concentrations, an increase of the sensitivity of the two -
step protocol for miRNA detection is attained by reducing th e distance between the reporter and 
the plasmonic NPs . Such improvement  can be fruitfully exploited to enhance  the detection of such 
biomarkers in real samples, due to the label -free approach featuring the assay.  
Conclusions  
Ag-porous silicon -PDMS  SERS su bstrate s were exploited to investigate the role of the Raman 
reporter position along the oligonucleotide sequence in the framework of a one-step and a two -
step hybridization assay  for the SERS detection of miRNAs.  As for the one -step assay, a significant  
 
 26 variation  (more than  6.5 nm) of  the reporter -to-surface distance could be obtained by labelling the 
miRNA at the 3’ and 5’ termin us. The SERS analysis of several miR -222 R-5’/3’  concentrations 
showed a  clearly greater SERS intensity for the 3’ configuration compared to the 5’ one over  5 
nM; such improved SERS detection  gradually vanish ed at lower miRNA concentrations.  FEM 
simulations of the electric near field for a  model Ag dimer on a porous s ilicon  surface suggested 
that the unexpected  concent ration -dependent outcome  could be compatible with  an increased hot -
spot contribution to the whole SERS signal in the nanomolar range  of miR -222 concentrations . On 
the other side, f or the two -step assay, a change in the reporter -to-surface spacing of about 4 nm 
was possible, by labelling the second half2 probe at the 3’  or 5’  termin us. The reduced varia tion 
of the reporter -to-surface distance between  the two detection configuration s yielded  a mitigated 
difference between the SERS int ensity observed for  the two labelling position s. Interestingly , the 
LOD for miR -222 was always lowered for the close -to-the-surface configuration , in contrast to the 
case of the on e-step assay. Such result , that was confirmed using two different Raman repo rters 
(R6G and Cy3),  point s out the possible role of steric hindrance in decreasing the hybridization 
efficiency in the case of the 3’ labelled miRNA. On the whole, the study allowed to improve the 
sensitivity of the two -step assay and provided new insight on the complex balance between 
plasmonic effects  and surface chemistry in the definition of a SERS bioassay  performance .
