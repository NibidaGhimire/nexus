1INTRODUCTION
CG Dra has remained an enigmatic object for more than half
a century. Initially found on the photographic plates taken by
K. Loechel in 1964 with the 1.34-m Schmidt telescope of the
Karl Schwarzschild Observatory, Hoﬀmeister (1966a, 1966b)
listsCGDraunderpreliminarydesignationS9370asUGem-
like, “most likely belonging to the CN Ori group.” U Gem
starsaredwarfnovae(DNe)—aparticulartypeofcataclysmic
variable (CV) consisting of a white dwarf (WD) primary star
accreting matter from a red dwarf secondary. Comprehensive
literature reviews of DNe are available from Warner (1995)
andHellier(2001).UGemDNearegenerallydividedintofour
subtypes:SSCyg,SUUMa,ZCamandWZSge.Whilethelat-
ter two are completely inapplicable classiﬁcations in the case
of CG Dra due to the lack of standstills and its long orbital
period, CGDra isusually referredto as aSS Cygstar (Bruch,
Schimpke, & Kochsiek, 1997; Kato et al., 2004). This type of
DN is characterized by periodic outbursts, Ví2–6 mag, in
some cases with plateau, outburst rise time of a few d and a
slightly longer decline, outburst interval of 10 d to a few yr,
and orbital period, Porb>3h. It is now widely accepted thatDNoutburstsoccurduetothethermallimitcycleinstabilityin
theprimary’saccretiondisk(AD),inparticularduetothepile-
up of material ﬂowing from the secondary at a rate exceeding
therateofaccretioninquiescence(Osaki,1974;Smak,1984).
At some point the disk becomes hot and ionized, this boosts
the system’s luminosity, increases disk viscosity, which then
causes the orbiting material to spread, due to the exchange of
angularmomentum,partiallyinwards,fallingtowardstheWD
primary. The increased accretion rate quickly drains the AD
and the system is returned to the cool, quiescent state.
The other subtype of DN, SU UMa, is characterized by the
addition of periodic superoutbursts, typically brighter by í2
mag and occurring about 3less frequently than normal out-
bursts,andashorter Porb<3h.AllSUUMa-typeDNeexhibit
superhumps—periodic modulations appearing near superout-
burst maximum with a period a few percent longer than Porb.

explaining superoutbursts and superhumps: the thermal-tidal
instability (TTI) model by Osaki (1989, 1996), the enhanced
mass transfer (EMT) model currently supported by Smak
(1991, 2004, 2017), and the pure thermal instability (PTI)arXiv:2301.05870v1  [astro-ph.SR]  14 Jan 20232 USATOV & SHEARS
model by Cannizzo, Smale, Wood, Still, & Howell (2012);
Cannizzo, Still, Howell, Wood, & Smale (2010).
Overviews of these models and description of associated
problems are available from Osaki & Kato (2013) and Smak
(2017). In brief, the TTI model requires eccentric AD to
explain superoutbursts. This condition occurs due to the 3:1
resonance in DNe with the mass ratio of components below
a critical value, qM2_M1¿ qcrit, whereqcritù 0:3,
coinciding with the DN period gap between Porbù 23
h. Smak (2020) proposes qcrit= 0:22, which corresponds to
the gap atù 2:6h. SU UMa DNe showing superoutbursts,
hence, should not be found above the period gap. The EMT
modelexplainssuperoutburstsastheresultofvariablehotspot

PTI model simulations suggest that thermal instability alone

cienttoexplainsuperoutburstsofSUUMastars.Atthecurrent

tion. The 14 eclipses recorded in both quiescent and outburst
states appeared symmetrical, with both eclipse duration and
depth independent of the state. The ﬂickering appeared to be
continuing throughout eclipses, suggesting that the system’s
inner AD is not occulted. In the earlier radial velocity mea-

during a BAA VSS observing campaign in 2022. As a result,
the number of observed eclipses has increased signiﬁcantly.

curve showed signiﬁcant negative linear trend. Ephemerides
found in §3 were used to calculate predicted eclipse minima.
Each eclipse light curve was truncated to the length of orbital
period, centered on its calculated minimum, and smoothed
usingGaussianﬁlterwith =0:2.Here,theﬁlterwasapplied
in time domain on unevenly sampled data, and the standard
deviation of the Gaussian distribution was found empirically
toremovelightcurveﬂickeringandothernoise.Approximate

point of the truncated smoothed light curve using a simple
condition that intensity of a smoothed light curve can only
increase with distance from the eclipse minimum towards

ing data. The minimum of the ﬁt was used to record the
observed eclipse minimum. Eclipses were folded using Porb
found in §3 and the observed minimum epoch. For each state
ofthesystem,foldedlightcurveswerecombinedintounevenly
sampled data sets which were averaged using Gaussian ﬁlter
with= 5, found empirically to produce a smoothly vary-
ing average eclipse proﬁle per state. This provides a case of
weighted averaging whereby data sets with fewer data points,i.e. higher inter-sampling time diﬀerence, receive a higher
degree of smoothing.
CG Dra exhibits a variety of eclipse proﬁles in line with
canonicalDNoutburstmodels.Quiescentstatesaredominated

CG Dra demonstrates a wide variety of eclipse proﬁles
throughout all of its states. The new data shows that CG Dra
ingress and egress phases vary from quiescence to bright out-
bursts, getting slightly wider as the system progresses from
quiescence to the bright outburst state. This suggests that the
size of the AD varies with the state of the system. Eclipse
depth also increases in this sequence. Both eﬀects are more
pronounced at the point of egress. Although only 5 eclipses
have been recorded in the bright outburst state, their proﬁles
are of particular interest, as they represent the system in its
extreme state. These eclipses are shown in ﬁgure 3 . Data
cadence is 30 s for all ﬁgures mentioned below. Common in
this state are post-egress “ﬂares” occurring immediately after
theegress—seepanesA,BandDforexample,andbroadpost-

High-amplitude “ﬂares” can be explained by the enhanced
accretionﬂowand,hence,strongﬂickeringinthisstate.How-
ever, the nature of post-egress humps at ù 0:10:5
is uncertain. In contrast to eclipses with post-egress humps

2.2Outburst Cycle and Decline Rate
CG Dra follows a quasiperiodic outburst cycle. A two-
dimensional spectrogram of frequencies in the domain of the
outburst cycle is shown in ﬁgure 6 . The method to compute
the spectrogram is similar to that described by Osaki & Kato
(2013), except for a few changes. Non-detrended normalized

2018).An AoV periodogram was computed for each step with
resolutionR= 1000, and the number of harmonics, nh= 1.USATOV & SHEARS 5

noted that CG Dra has an unusual outburst decline rate for

decline rates peak at í0:36and average at ù0:25(mag d*1),
approximately half way to quiescence. Rise rates are about
twice as fast. This conﬁrms that CG Dra deviates from the
expected relation for DNe.
3EPHEMERIDES
3.1Orbital Period and the O–C Chart
In order to ﬁnd the orbital period, the long-term CG Dra
light curve was detrended using a locally weighted polyno-
mial regression algorithm (Cleveland, 1979) implemented via
LOWESS Python package by A. Lee. The bandwidth param-
eterb= 0:005was used which produces a smoothed light
curve while preserving signals in the orbital period domain.
The smoothed curve was subtracted from the original data
to produce detrended light curve. The P4J AoV algorithm6 USATOV & SHEARS

implementation was used to ﬁnd the orbital period from the
detrended data, with R= 104andnh= 8. The most promi-
nentpeakwasreﬁnedwith R=105.Toestimateperioderror,
asnointerferingfrequenciesweredetectedandthelevelofthe
orbital period is quite strong, S_N= 76, we adopt a simple
procedure described by Schwarzenberg-Czerny (1991), appli-
cable to strong signals. The mean noise power level, N2, was

thep*N2level represents the 1conﬁdence interval of the
spectral line. The Porbfound is 0.188640 ,0.000007 d. This
corresponds to 4h31m38s,1s.
ThePorbvalue was tested by constructing the observed
minus calculated (O–C) chart, shown in ﬁgure 7 , compar-
ing observed eclipse minima calculated as described in §2
with predicted values. Eclipses with poor Gaussian ﬁts were
removed. No signiﬁcant period change from test ephemeris
was detected.

3.2Spectrogram in the Orbital Period
Domain
To search for potential superhump signatures, typically
expected within a few percent of Porb, we build a spectro-
gram within this domain of frequencies, shown in ﬁgure 8 .

gramstepequalto 1_100andthewindowof 1_20ofthewhole

As an additional test we constructed a phase-dispersion
minimization (PDM) (Stellingwerf, 1978) spectrogram of the
same detrended data. The PDM algorithm used was imple-
mented in the A STROBASE Python package (Bhatti, Bouma,
& Wallace, 2018). A spectrogram window of 1/20 and step
of 1/40, of the whole data set were used, with R= 100.

4DISCUSSION
CG Dra appears to exhibit two distinct types of outbursts,
which we can call normal and bright outbursts. Bright out-
bursts resemble SU UMa-type superoutbursts, however, CG

U Gem subtype between SS Cyg and SU UMa.
Assuming CG Dra bright outbursts correspond to SU UMa
superoutbursts, the lack of superhumps provides a challenge
for the TTI model that requires superhumps to be present
due to the eccentric AD. If superoutbursts appear due to the
tidal dissipation in the eccentric disk then this also creates a
problem,asCGDraislocatedwellabovetheperiodgapwhere
theseeﬀectsarenotsupposedtohappen.AssumingCGDrais
related to the SS Cyg subtype, what then explains the appear-
ance of bright outbursts? Long outbursts can actually occur
in SS Cyg DNe—for example, the 45-day long outburst of U
Gemin1985,somewhatbrighterthanthenormaloutburstsof
this star. Smak & Waagen (2004) have, in fact, detected 0.3

Hameury, Lasota, & Warner (2000) estimate that the mass
accreted during the 1985 U Gem outburst was higher than the
massof thewholeAD inquiescence.A likelytrigger forsuch
an outburst would have been the increased mass transfer rate
from the secondary, probably caused by the irradiation of the
secondary, supporting the EMT superoutburst model. How-
ever, this long outburst was an isolated episode, unlike the
periodic bright outbursts we observe in CG Dra.
SS Cyg itself exhibits bi-modal outburst distribution, with
long outbursts lasting >12d, and short, lasting <12d (Price
et al., 2007). These are generally sequenced LS (long-short)
and, less commonly, LLS, LSSS or LLSS. The amplitude of

compare this with CG Dra, its normal and bright outbursts
diﬀer signiﬁcantly in amplitude and, with two bright outburst
cycles observed, 4–5 normal outbursts are seen between the
bright ones.
There is an example of a DN which exhibits properties of
diﬀerentsubtypesatthesametime—NYSerpentisthatshows
three distinctive type of outbursts: normal, wide outbursts
without superhumps, and superoutbursts with superhumps
(Pavlenko et al., 2014). NY Ser could be an intermediary DN
subtype—a case potentially applicable to CG Dra.In addition to the problems presented above, CG Dra pro-
vides another challenge: unexpected spectral type of the sec-
ondary star. Although this work is focused on photometry,
it is worth mentioning this problem, at least in brief. The

Yet another spectroscopic issue with CG Dra is that its
emissionandabsorptionspectrumlinesmoveinphase(Bruch
et al., 1997). In CVs, the absorption component is generally
attributed to the secondary star, and emission—to the hotter
AD, thus an opposite is expected. No reasonable explanation
of this observation exists.
5CONCLUSION
We have presented the most extensive photometric data set
availableonCGDratodate.Theorbitalperiodmeasuredwas
Porb=4h31m38s,1s. Throughout diﬀerent states of the sys-
temavarietyofeclipseproﬁleswasobserved,consistentwith
standardDNmodelswiththeexceptionofpost-egress“ﬂares”
andbroadhumps.Thepresenceoftwotypesofquasi-periodic
outbursts—normal and bright—was evident in the data. No
superhump signatures were found in AoV and PDM spectro-
grams at frequencies in the domain of Porb. Assuming the
brightoutburstsofCGDracorrespondtoSUUMa-typesuper-
outbursts, this creates an issue of explaining, within the TTI
model, how superoutbursts appear without superhumps in a
DNthatissigniﬁcantlyabovetheperiodgap,whereSUUMa-
type stars should not be found. For both normal and bright
outbursts, we conﬁrm that the decline rates observed are too
slow for known DN decay time– Porbrelations.
InterpretingCGDrawithincanonicalDNclassiﬁcationand
models is problematic. Do post-egress “ﬂares” during bright
outburst and, occasionally and to a lesser extent, in normal
outburst state, represent EMT episodes that lead to superout-
bursts? What triggers bright outbursts in this system and are
post-egress humps related to them? Further observations are8 USATOV & SHEARS
