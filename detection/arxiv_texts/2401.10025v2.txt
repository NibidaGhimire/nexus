We investigate quasitopological black holes in (2 + 1) dimensions in the context of
electromagnetic-generalized-quasitopological-gravities (EM-GQT). For three different families of
geometries of quasitopological nature, we study the causal structure and their response to a probe
scalar field. To linear order, we verify that the scalar field evolves stably, decaying in different
towers of quasinormal modes. The studied black holes are either charged geometries (regular and
singular) or a regular Ba˜ nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ)-like black hole, both coming from the
EM-GQT theory characterized by nonminimal coupling parameters between gravity and a back-
ground scalar field. We calculate the quasinormal modes applying different numerical methods
with convergent results between them. The oscillations demonstrate a very peculiar structure for
charged black holes: in the intermediate and near extremal cases, a particular scaling arises, similar
to that of the rotating BTZ geometry, with the modes being proportional to the distance between
horizons. For the single horizon black hole solution, we identify the presence of different quasi-
normal families by analyzing the features of that spectrum. In all three considered geometries, no
instabilities were found.

2I. INTRODUCTION
Black hole solutions in lower dimensional gravity can be a good testing ground for four-
dimensional gravity ideas since they are simpler and share various features with the black
hole solutions in higher dimensions. Aspects of gravity solutions in two and three dimensions
with flat and anti-de Sitter/de Sitter (AdS/dS) asymptotic spatial infinity were extensively
studied in the seminal work of Jackiw [1](for a detailed review on black hole solutions in lower
dimensions, see also [2]). Another pioneer breakthrough was the Ban˜ ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli
(BTZ) black hole [3], a three-dimensional solution whose spatial infinity is AdS-like having
well-defined conserved charges as mass, angular momentum, and electric charge. Hennigar et
al.[4] found a three-dimensional black hole solution with Gauss-Bonnet term nonminimally
coupled to a scalar field, which recovers the BTZ black hole when the Gauss-Bonnet coupling
constant goes to zero. BTZ black holes with higher curvature corrections were considered
in [5]. A family of black hole solutions in three dimensions exhibiting Lifshitz scaling in
the new massive gravity was considered in [6]. For a comprehensive analysis, identification,
and algebraic categorization of exact solutions in (2 + 1)-dimensional Einstein gravity, refer
to [7]. It provides valuable insights on low-energy (2 + 1)-dimensional string gravity, black
holes coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, and a general discussion on Einstein equations
coupled to matter and fields.
More recently, Bueno et al. [8] found another family of three-dimensional black hole so-
lutions in the context of the so-called electromagnetic-generalized-quasitopological-gravities
(EM-GQT). Such gravity theory is shaped considering a specific lagrangian density that
encodes the Einstein-Hilbert term plus a nonminimal coupling between kinetic terms of the
real scalar field ∂aϕ, the Ricci scalar Rand Ricci tensor Rab, respectively. The black hole
solutions are obtained through the imposition of what was called a ”magnetic” ansatz to the
scalar field i. e., ϕproportional to the compact angular coordinate φ, and the metric tensor
components obeying gttgrr=−1. Depending on the choice of the undetermined coupling
constants of the lagrangian density, there are black hole solutions with one or multiple hori-
zons and with or without singularities, representing a generalization of the BTZ black holes
[3]. The class of solutions describing regular EM-GQT black holes is exquisite as long as the
formation of singularities in lower-dimensional gravity and general relativity (GR) reveals
the breakdown of such theories requiring the inclusion of quantum corrections [9, 10].
3In (2 + 1) dimensions, the theory proposed by [8] is based on their counterparts in higher
dimensions [11, 12]. Typically, theories with higher order curvature terms extend the un-
derstanding of a zeroth order approach of curvature such as GR in four dimensions or that
considered by Ba˜ nados et al. in [3]. In [11, 12], a general electromagnetic term nonmini-
mally coupled to curvature is schematically described as yielding regular conditions for the
gravitational and electromagnetic fields, namely singularity-free black holes. Beyond that
benefit of presenting regular spacetimes with horizons as black hole mimickers (also know as
regular black holes), the study of AdS geometries in such comes with nontrivial properties
of their conformal field theory (CFT) counterparts where the spacetime molded peculiar
behavior as superconductivity is to be unveiled.
The lower-dimensional theory of [8] represents an extension of the traditional (2 + 1)
gravity with a very interesting specificity not to be seen in the higher dimensional counter-
part: the duality of the electromagnetic source to a coupled scalar field theory system. In
particular, whenever such a scalar field is given in terms of an azimuthal one-form (mag-
netic gauge), the theory presents a very elegant solution [see (4], below) with a multitude of
possible black holes.
Different models characterizing and building regular black holes have been considered
since the work of Bardeen [13]. Exact regular solutions with the inclusion of nonlinear
electromagnetic fields were studied in [14]. Gravity nonminimally coupled to Maxwell elec-
tromagnetic fields were considered in [15].
This work considers three significant cases of EM-GQT black holes: a singular solution
with Cauchy and event horizons and two regular solutions with one and two horizons. Our
aim is twofold: the characterization of the geometry of those EM-GQT three-dimensional
black holes to understand the physics in inner and outer regions; we also address the question
of spacetime stability doing the computation of scalar field perturbations and quasinormal
modes (QNM) ignited by a probe scalar field. Since the ringdown phase of perturbed
black holes is characterized by the quasinormal modes [16, 17] and independent of the
initial perturbation, the QNM can bring important information about the properties of
black hole geometry. The oscillations represent part of the observations in the gravitational
interferometers [18–20]. The QNM can also shed light on the question of the linear stability
of black hole solution under small perturbations modeled by classical probe fields [21–27].
Additionally, QNM plays an essential role in the context of AdS/CFT conjecture [28], in
4which the relaxation timescale for the dual field theory at finite temperature is given by the
inverse of the imaginary part of the fundamental quasinormal mode [29–33].
In (2+1) dimensions, the quasinormal modes were richly studied in the past. They were
first calculated in [34] and [35] providing a deep understanding of the AdS/CFT duals [36]
and scrutinized in several different works [37–51]. Here, we will analyze the structure of
the different quasinormal spectra in light of the studies performed in the past and their
developments.
Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we review the essential aspects of the
EM-GQT black hole solutions and explore the conformal structure. In Sec. III, we discuss
the methods for finding the QNM due to the propagation of a massless probe scalar field.
Finally, Sec. IV summarizes the results and discusses possible open questions.
II. BLACK HOLE SOLUTIONS
In this paper, we are going to consider black hole solutions of the equations of motion
coming from the action [8]

where Gis the gravitational constant in (2 + 1) dimensions, Lis the AdS-like curvature

m=0βmL2(m+1)(∂ϕ)2m
(2m+ 3)Rab−gabR
∂aϕ∂bϕ. (2)
The dimensionless constants αnandβnare entirely arbitrary, and their physics depend on
the specific solution of the theory (1).
The action expressed in (1) brings Γ as a quasitopological (not invariant) term similar
to that of other quasitopological gravities (QTGs) studied along the past decades [52]. In
such theories, gravitation comes as a consequence of an action with all possible independent
cubic curvature contractions of the Riemann tensor. The invariant brings interesting met-
ric solutions with AdS ansatz scrutinized in different studies and contrarily to the similar
topological theories as e. g. that of Lovelock gravities. In the QTGs, we do not have S
as an invariant of the spacetime and the border acts nontrivially delimiting the geometry,
depending on the chosen topology for the spacetime [11, 12, 52].
5We will consider the following ansatz for the line element ds2and the background scalar
fieldϕ,
ds2=−f(r)dt2+f(r)−1dr2+r2dφ2, ϕ=pφ, (3)
with pstanding for an arbitrary dimensionless constat (that can be real or purely imaginary)
and ( t, r, φ ) denoting the coordinate system in which t∈[0,+∞[,r∈[0,+∞[ and φ∈
[0,2π]. In this case, setting α1= 0 the solution of the motion equations is given by
f(r) = 
r2
L2−µ+X
n=2An
r2(n−1)! 
1 +X
m=0Bm
r2(m+1)!−1
, (4)
where An=αnp2nL2(n−1)/2(n−1) and Bm= (2m+ 1)βm(Lp)2(m+1)andµis an integration
constant which is written in terms of the black hole mass Mas
M=µ+β0p2+α1p2log (r0
L), (5)
where r0is a cutoff radius. Such a mass Mis divergent as r0→ ∞ as in the charged
BTZ solution [53]. For the black hole solutions considered in the present work, we have set
α1= 0, so the cutoff is unnecessary. If all AnandBmcoefficients are zero, the spacetime
corresponds to the simplest BTZ black hole [3].
The lowest terms in (4), namely α1,2andβ1provide us regular (and singular) black
holes solutions representing a nice first order theory: e. g. the lapse function of (9) and
(14) resembles that of Reissner-Nordstr¨ om solutions in GR and in such (as we report in
our results) possesses a family of oscillations proportional to the distance between horizons.
However, unlike the four-dimensional black holes, where such a family of oscillations is
subdominant [54, 55], in the particular solutions we treat, they play the commanding role
in the quasinormal spectrum.
If we consider (2) in a context of small coupling factor (lower alphas and betas) the
charged nonrotating BTZ black hole ( α1̸= 0 and α̸=1=βn= 0) is a possible solution
of (4) studied in [56] as also the charged BTZ black holes consequently from nonlinear
electrodynamical terms (see [57] and references therein). As expected, whenever the extra
constants are turned off, (4) recovers the Ba˜ nados-Teitelbonn-Zanelli geometry and hence
we can consider it as a deformation of a zeroth order theory.
The line element (3) together with (4) describes a family of static and circular symmetric
black holes with or without curvature singularity, depending on how many constants αnand
βmare turned on in the theory.
6As mentioned, the magnetic ansatz for the scalar field [8] corresponds to make it propor-
tional to the form φ. In the EM-GQT theory, the density Γ is dual to an electromagnetic
Lagrangian
Ldual=R+2
L2−Γ−Fabεabc∂cϕ (6)
in which the electromagnetic tensor Fis written as
Fab=−1
2εabc∂L
∂∂cϕ. (7)
When solved perturbatively, such ansatz allows for a relation between ϕandFreducing the
latter to its typical form, of known usual charged black holes, that of an electromagnetic
tensor Fproduced solely by a source term Aof type A=Aadxa=At(r)dt. In that case,
the solution for the source Ais of electric type (as usually in charged black holes) written
depending on the coefficients of the theory as
At(r) =−α1plog (r/L)+X
n=2nαnp
2(n−1)Lp
r2(n−1)
+f′(r)LX
m=0βm(m+1)Lp
r2m+1
.(8)
We will analyze three different cases in what follows, considering the presence of only
one extra (geometric) parameter besides those of a BTZ black hole with mass and negative
cosmological constant.
The first family of black holes considered is singular, featuring event and Cauchy horizons,
with a function f(r) identical to the four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr¨ om-AdS black hole
a very interesting peculiarity of the solution.
The other two families of black holes are regular; each represents a different type of
regular solution with an event horizon in EM-GQT. The first type corresponds to regular
solutions in which f(r= 0) = 1 and a constrained parameter p=p
2β0/α2[see Eq. (14)].
For the second type, f(r→0)→O(r2s), with s≥1 [see Eq. (19)]. In both regular cases,
the curvature invariants are finite everywhere.
A. Singular black hole with two horizons: SBH
Let us consider the solution with one constant α2and set α1,n≥3=βm= 0. Then the

in which r+=r−the surface gravity goes to zero similarly to the four-dimensional extremal
Reissner-Nordstr¨ om black hole. Apart from such occasion, the black hole given by (9) has
a timelike singularity at the origin covered by the event and Cauchy horizons. The spatial
infinity is conformally AdS-like as in other BTZ-like geometries.

bringing a curvature singularity at r= 0 and positive constant value K∼12
L4atr→ ∞ . For
a more detailed description of the nature of the singularity we proceed to the Penrose-Carter
diagram.
The Kruskal-Szekers-like coordinates ( U, V) adapted to the event horizon r+are
U+V+=∓r−r+
r+r+r+r+
r−r−k+/k−
, (12)
where the upper sign refers to r > r +and the lower sign refers to r < r −. For the Cauchy
horizon r−, they have a new set of coordinates ( U, V)
U−V−=±r−r−
r+r−r+r+
r−r+k−/k+
, (13)
in which the upper sign refers to the region r−≤r≤r+and the lower sign refers to
0≤r≤r+. These relations allow us to perform a compactification of the spacetime regions
and then combine the overlapping coordinates patches ( U+, V+) and ( U−, V−) to obtain the
conformal diagram of (9). That is shown in Fig. 1 (left panel).
The diagram structure is identical to the four-dimensional Reissner-N¨ ordstrom-AdS black
hole [59]. Notice that the whole spacetime consists of an infinite lattice of identical blocks,
each containing an event and Cauchy horizon and a timelike singularity at r= 0. Due to the
repulsive character of the timelike singularity, a real particle in region III will cross r=r−
and emerge in a white hole horizon with asymptotically AdS-like outer region I.
8As explored in [8] the dual frame description of the theory (1)[60] allows to consider the
constant qe=α2p3L2as an “electric charge” with the electrostatic potential At=qer−2.
The particular shape of the source Ain this case is the same as that of the non-linear
electrodynamics theory (Einstein-Power-Maxwell) [61, 62] if we consider a density of type
L= (FµνFµν)2/3. In such theory, qecan be interpreted as the electrical charge of the non-
linear density Land the source term corresponds exactly to that of our gravity with only
α2̸= 0 thus justifying the interpretation of that quantity as electric charge.
Such a result agrees with the conclusion that the effective potential of an uncharged
real particle in region III near the timelike singularity is repulsive, preventing the particle’s
motion from terminating at r= 0.

Notice that the event and Cauchy horizons locations are the same as in the case of the
singular black hole. It is convenient to define the parameter Q=p
r−r+/L, associated to
the presence of the background scalar field that we will use as a parameter of the black
hole extremality ( Qext=r+) in the numerical calculations presented in next section. We
emphasize that such parameter is not associated with a charge defined via source term A,
differently from the previous case.
The manifest difference with the first spacetime is the absence of a curvature singularity
atr= 0 in the context of solution (14). In such a case, r= 0 is a well-behaved surface that
is confirmed by the curvature scalar Kwhen r→0 and written as

. (16)
Near to the spatial infinity ( r→ ∞ ) the curvature scalar has the approximate value of BTZ
black hole curvature K∼KBTZ=12
L4.
The regular black hole with two horizons has the same Kruskal-Szekes extension as the
singular black hole (12), (13). But now, being r= 0 a regular surface, the manifold extends
beyond it. The surface gravity at event and Cauchy horizons are, respectively
k+=|r2

r+(r2

k−=|r2

The Penrose-Carter diagram for the regular black hole with two horizons has the same
structure as in the previous case for the singular solution (left diagram in Fig. 1) except for
the timelike singularity which is absent in the regular solution.
10On a timelike trajectory, a particle with zero angular momentum can go through the
regular surface r= 0, since the effective potential is finite in this region, otherwise the
potential is infinitely repulsive preventing the particle to cross r= 0, similarly to the singular
black hole solution (9) and the four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr¨ om AdS black hole [59].
C. Regular black hole with one horizon and without charge
Another representative regular black hole solution is obtained by considering αn= 0,
βm>0= 0 and only β0̸= 0. In this case (4) reduces to
f(r) =r2

, (19)
in which we choose pto be real and β0>0[63]. The spacetime is asymptotically AdS-like
and has an event horizon at r=r+with a regular origin at r= 0. In Fig. 1 (right panel),
we performed a change in the radial coordinate r=r0+y, where r0is a positive constant
giving the size of the throat of the black hole and y∈]− ∞,+∞[. For a timelike geodesic
entering region II of the right diagram, the effective potential in the vicinity of r= 0 is finite
allowing massive particles to cross the region y=r0reaching region III.
The curvature scalar Kwhen r→0 is given by

being regular at the origin as aforementioned. In this case, near to the spatial infinity
(r→ ∞ ) the curvature scalar has the approximate value of BTZ black hole curvature
K∼KBTZ=12
L4, too.
In the previous analysis, from the three representative black hole solutions studied, two
of them are regular (14),(19) and another has a timelike singularity at the origin (9). The
regular solution without charge is the most simple and the first (to the best of our known)
regular black hole in (2+1) dimensions similar to that of the BTZ geometry endowed with
an extra scalar hair λ
λ=p
β0pL (21)
such that the lapse function is defined in terms of three parameters L,r+andλ. By
inspection we may verify that such parameter is directly defined by the coupling constant
11of the theory and the other two spacetime properties, r+andLas long as in this case,
Γ =−8λ4(r2
++L2)
L2(r2+λ2)2. (22)
When λis turned off, we recover the pure BTZ spacetime.
We recall that in the asymptotic spatial infinity region, the curvature of all three space-
times is constant and same as that of the BTZ spacetime curvature.
In the lapse function (19) the redefinition λ=β1/2
0pLallows us the reabsorption of the
coupling constant pof the electric ansatz (or the scalar one in the dual scheme) in terms of
the coupling constants α´s and β´s of the theory or vice-versa.
That is also the case for the other two black holes considered above as it can be seen
trough the potential A(r). In this work we consider solutions of such theory with only one
extra geometric parameter, λorr−that generate the above black holes regular and singular
with multiple or single horizons. In this fashion, we studied the influence that this extra
property can produce in the quasinormal spectrum and stability of the spacetime.
We will perform a perturbative analysis of those spacetimes by computing the quasinormal
frequencies due to a probe massless scalar field and in such, study the linear stability of the
geometries.
III. PERTURBATIVE ANALYSIS: PROBE SCALAR FIELD AND QUASINOR-
MAL FREQUENCIES
Let us consider the propagation of a probe massless scalar field in the geometry whose
dynamical behavior is dictated by the Klein-Gordon equation,
2ψ=1√−g∂µ √−ggµν∂νψ
= 0. (23)
In (2+1)-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes as that of (3), the above equation
can be written in the form
4∂2Ψ
∂u∂v+V(r)Ψ = 0 . (24)
Here uandvare the usual double-null coordinates defined as du=dt−dr∗anddv=dt+dr∗
with dr∗=f−1drrepresenting the tortoise coordinate. The scalar field is decomposed as
ψ(t, r, φ ) =r−1/2e−iκφΨ(u, v) and the effective potential V(r) is written as
V(r) =fκ2
r2+f′
2r−f
4r2
, (25)
12with κbeing the angular momentum of the field and′denoting a derivative with relation
tor.
The shape of V(r) dictates the analysis of the dynamical stability of the geometry. When-
everV(r)>0 (in the region r > r +) the geometry is proved to be stable to linear pertur-
bations [22, 29, 64]. On the other hand if V(r)<0 at last in some part of r > r +, the
geometry can destabilize, depending on “how negative” V(r) is. We studied widely the
effective potential of all three geometries and obtained V(r)>0 whenever r > r +, such
that no instabilities are expected in the field evolution, what we confirm with numerical
computations. They are given explicitly in the expressions below,

14It is worth to mention that both VSBHandVRBHare singular at the origin, contrary to the
one horizon black hole. This fact is particularly important in the regular black hole case,
because despite the fact that the hypersurface is regular, the effective potential becomes
singular at r= 0. It can possibly drive a Cauchy horizon instability. When r→ ∞ all three
potentials go as V∼3r2
4L4, a characteristic behavior of asymptotically AdS spacetimes.
The fact that V > 0 in the region r≥r+makes possible the investigation of the quasi-
normal spectra of the black holes taking plane waves as boundary condition (near horizon)
with the double null integration technique [65]. Together with the Prony method [66],
both numerical calculations provide the quasinormal frequencies with good accuracy. As a
cross-check method we use the Frobenius expansion similar to that developed in [29]. In
such expansion, we consider the wave equation with the new radial coordinate z= 1/r,
developing that to

r=1/z. The Klein-Gordon field is now adjusted to the
ansatz ψ=e−iωt+iκφΨ(z). The solution of the equation considers a series expansion around
the event horizon z+=r−1
+and the first boundary condition for quasinormal modes ingoing
plane waves at z+implicitly implemented in the series expansion, Ψ →P
n(z−z+)n+α. That
corresponds to the choice α= 0, in accordance with (32). Finally the method consists in
truncating the series in a certain number of terms with the quasinormal equation Ψ(0) = 0
numerical implemented, which represents the second boundary condition, typical of AdS
spacetimes.
A. Singular and regular black holes with charge
The singular black hole with charge represented by the line element (9) possesses two
regular horizons. The most external of those, the event horizon characterizes the boundary
of the scattering problem and in that region, the plane wave condition reads
Ψ|r∗→−∞→e−iωr∗(33)
Since the scalar potential diverges in the AdS infinity ( r∗= 0 or r=∞), besides the usual
plane wave condition at the horizon, we require that
Ψ|r∗=0→0 (34)
15which settles the scattering question down.
The fundamental quasinormal modes obtained for the singular and regular charged black
holes are displayed in Table I.
TABLE I. Quasinormal modes of the massless scalar field with κ= 0. For simplicity we use
a fraction of the charge, Q=p
r+r−/Lrelative to its maximum value, Qmax=r+defined as
R=Q/Q max. All frequencies are purely imaginary and stable, ℑ(ω)<0.

As expected, these modes are purely imaginary and under specific condition have a worth
scaling with the black hole parameters written as
ωsing=−2ir+(1−R2) =−2i(r+−r−), (35)
ωreg=−ir+(1−R2) =−i(r+−r−), (36)
for singular and regular charged black holes respectively. The fundamental modes (singular
geometry) expressed by (35) follow very strictly the same scaling calculated in [35] (left
branch) which is strictly related to the critical phenomena of the black hole formation.
In the singular spacetime the variance of (35) to the data of Table I for larger black
holes is smaller than the usual deviation using different methods to quasinormal modes (in
some cases to the 6th figure). In the pure BTZ limit ( r−= 0), our results with double-null
16integration presented here are about 0 .2% to 0 .3% deviant from the analytical frequencies
[34]. Relation (35) couples the results of Table I almost perfectly ( r+>1) and recovers the
pure BTZ case whenever r−= 0 [34, 67].
In the charged regular geometry, contrarily to what is found in typical BTZ-like black
holes with spherical symmetry the frequencies are not a linear function of size of the hole
when r+is small. In regimes of intermediate to high spacetime charge and hole size ( r+) such
scale is recovered and the expression (36) arises representing half the value of the scaling of
the singular case. We show the typical scalar field evolution in Fig, 5. The attenuation of ω

with increasing black hole charge is typical for charged BTZ-like black holes [56, 68]. In fact,
in the purely charged BTZ geometries, such weakening is even more pronounced: for small
black hole charges, the damping of the fundamental mode lowers ca. 30% when the black
hole charge diminishes 10%. In our case, a smaller depletion is observed as a result of the
electromagnetic potential shape which is similar to the (3+1) geometries (and very different
from the charged BTZ). In this case, the conditions for superradiance and unstable mode
evolutions for a charged scalar field will be affected, generating a specific spectrum very
different from the pure BTZ geometry [69] to be addressed in separate lines of investigation
for another works.
17B. Regular black hole with one horizon
The last black hole we analyze is the regular BTZ solution with a three parameter lapse
function as that of (4). In such case the extra parameter λ, acts similarly to an AdS
cosmological term, attenuating the value of ℑ(ω) as it increases. A table with quasinormal
spectra and different λis presented in Table II.

The values of Table II were obtained with the Frobenius method and confirmed with
good accuracy with the characteristic integration scheme. Their deviation is no higher than
0.1% (except for the highest λcase with a difference of about 1%).
In the Tables III and IV we list the calculated frequencies with angular momentum
obtaining an interesting feature in that spectra: the quasinormal modes change from an

oscillatory pattern to a purely imaginary character as we increase λ. Such change may be
related to the presence of a secondary family of modes taking control of the field evolution.
Interestingly we can see that ℑ(ω) goes in different directions with increasing λ. In the
primary family, the increase in λrises the damping of the oscillation and in the purely
imaginary scenario, the opposite happens. The existence of multiple families of oscillations
were described in many references along the last years [26, 54, 70] though its presence has
to be verified with analytical methods identifying overtone numbers for each family.
IV. FINAL REMARKS
Black hole solutions in lower dimensions are a fruitful scenario to test ideas and proprieties
of general relativity solutions in (3+1) dimensions. This paper analyzed three representative
families of (2+1)-black hole solutions in the EM-GQT theories, with two of them featuring
Cauchy and event horizons with and without curvature singularity at the origin. Those black
holes share almost the same causal proprieties as in the Reissner-Nordstr¨ om-AdS black hole
in (3 + 1) dimensions. In the case of the singular solution, the maximal extension is the
same, and for the regular solution, the timelike singularity at r= 0 is absent, as expected.
After crossing the Cauchy horizon, an uncharged massive particle can avoid the timelike
singularity due to a repulsive gravitational force near r= 0, as in the Reissner-Nordst¨ om
19solution. The same occurs in the case of the regular solution, but only for particles with
angular momentum k̸= 0.
The third black hole family is regular with one horizon and recovering the BTZ solution
when the parameter λ=β0L2p2goes to zero. The causal structure shows that a timelike
particle will cross the well-behaved surface r= 0 and emerge asymptotically with an AdS
white hole as in the diagram on the right side of Fig. (1).
We tested all three families of black holes against a scalar field introduced in the geometry
as a probe to the background geometry. To linear order, we can see the scalar field decay in
time in sets of quasinormal modes with a very peculiar structure. In the singular charged
black hole, we observe the fundamental mode to scale the distance between horizons just
as proposed in the rotating case [35], which is an astonishing novelty since the geometry,
contrary to that of [35] is static. Another interesting scaling arrives in the regular black hole
for intermediate and near extremal charges, proportional to the same distance but with an
attenuation of 1/2.
The regular black hole with only one horizon possesses another interesting quasinormal
mode spectral structure denoting the presence of oscillatory families competing with purely
imaginary frequencies to dominate the field profile. Depending on the black hole parameters,
one or another cast as the most resilient profile.
Further lines of investigation in view of quasitopological black holes we study here are
the test of different probe fields in such geometries and instabilities delivered by a charged
scalar perturbation as usual of charged geometry, which can be seen in the simplest charged
BTZ black hole [69].
