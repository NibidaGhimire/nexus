Abstract  
Electrical resistivity, magnetoresistivity, and the Hall effect have been studied in a 
topological semimetal WTe 2 single crystal  in the temperature range from 12 to 200 K under 
magnetic fields up to 9 T. It has been found that quadratic temperature dependences of the 
electrical resist ivity in the absence of  a magnetic field and  the conductivity in a magnetic field are 
observed at l ow temperatures,  which is apparently  associated with contributions from various 
scattering mechanisms. Single -band and two- band models were used to analyze data on the Hall 
effect and magnetoresistivity. These results indicate electron ‚Äìhole compensation wi th a slight 
predominance of electron charge carriers.  
Keywords

1. Introduction  
In recent years, a large number of different topological materials have been discovered , 
including topological insulators and topological semimetals [1 ‚Äì6]. Considerable attention is drawn 
to topological semimetals that can be divided into the following three main groups: We yl 
semimetals, Dirac semimetals, and topological nodal line semimetals. In Dirac and Weyl 
semimetals, two double -degenerate bands or two nondegenerate bands intersect with each other at 
special points ( nodes ) near the Fermi level, thereby forming Dirac poi nts or Weyl points, 
respectively, and disperse linearly in all three directions of momentum. The corresponding low -
energy excitations behave similarly to Dirac and Weyl fermions in high -energy physics.  
It is known that Weyl fermions can occur in systems with broken inversion or time -reversal 
symmetry [3 ‚Äì6]. In this regard, noncentrosymmetric semimetals, such as TaAs, and magnetic 
semimetals, such as some Heusler alloys, are candidates for Weyl semimetals . The first 
experimental confirmation of the existence of the Weyl semimetal phase was obtained on single 
crystals of the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs, and NbP) in 2015 [7]. Moreover, the authors of [8] 
predicted a special type of band crossing  with a stro ngly tilted Weyl cone along a certain direction 
in the  momentum space, the so- called type- II Weyl semimetals.  The existence of the type- II Weyl 
semimetal phase  was predicted and experimentally confirmed in such  layered t ransition metal 
dichalcogenides as  WTe2 [8, 9], MoTe 2, and ternary compound Mo xW1 ‚Äì xTe2 [10].  
The peculiarities of the electronic structure of  topological materials are reflected in their 
electronic properties and lead to a number of unusual effects, such as extremely large 
magnetoresistance without a  tendency to saturation, high mobility and low effective  mass of 
current carriers, nontrivial Berry phase, chiral  anomaly,  anomalous Hall effect, and linear behavior  
of optical conductivity [5, 6]. One of these unusual effects is  a quadratic temperature dependence 
of the electrical resistivity of WTe 2 [11] and MoTe 2 [12] in a very wide  temperature range from 2 
to 70 K and 50 K, respectively. It can be expected that a quadratic temperature dependence of their resistivity should be observed in the presence of a magnetic field as well. It is also worth  noting 
that either single -band [13] or two- band models  are usually  used when analyzing data on the Hall  
effect with subsequent calculation of the concentration and mobility of current c arriers [14]. At 
the same time, it is not entirely clear how correct a particular  model is.  
This study is devoted to the analysis of kinetic  properties (electrical resistivity, 
magnetoresistivity,  the Hall effect) of a WTe 2 single crystal to establish the  form  of temperature 
dependence of resistivity (conductivity)  in a magnetic field, and to the use of single -band  and two-
band models for the analysis of galvanomagnetic  properties.  
 
2. M aterials and techniques  
2.1. Singl e crystal growth  and structural analysis  
WTe 2 single crystals were grown using the method of chemical vapor transport [15]. Fig. 1  
shows t he scheme of growing the single crystals . Tungsten and tellurium in a stoichiometric ratio 
were placed in a quartz ampoule with a length of 24 cm and a diameter of 1.5 cm. The ampoule 
was evacuated to a residual pressure of about 10‚Äì4 atm and then placed in a horizontal tube furnace 
with a linear temperature gradient. The hot zone had a temperature of 850¬∞C, and the cold zone, 
i.e., the crystal growth z one, had a temperature of 770¬∞C. The single crystal growth process lasted 
500 h. The resulting crystals have a needle shape with lengths of 3  ‚Äì 5 mm, widths of 0.2  ‚Äì 1.0 
mm, and thicknesses of 50 ‚Äì 400 Œºm.  
Fig. 2 shows a  fragment of the diffraction pattern  taken from the  surface of the WTe 2 sample. 
All peaks can be indexed as (00 l). Hence, the surface of a WTe 2 single crystal coincides with the 
(001) plane. It was  established that  WTe 2 compound crystallize d in the orthorhombic structure 
(space group Pmn 21) with lattice parameters a = 3.435(8) √Ö , b = 6.312(7) √Ö, and c = 14.070(4) √Ö. 
The surface microstructure and the chemical composition of the crystals were analyzed on a 
FEI Quanta 200 Pegasus scanning electron microscope equipped with an EDAX attachment for X-ray energy dispersive microanalysis at the Collaborative Access Center ‚ÄúTesting Center of 
Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials‚Äù (TC NTAM), Institute of Metal Physics, Ural Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences. Fig. 3  shows i mages of the (001) surface and the lateral surface the 
WTe
2 single crystal . As can be seen from Fig. 3, th e resulting single crystal has a layered structure. 
Fig. 4  shows t he results of X -ray energy dispersive microanalysis of the WTe 2 single crystal. The 
contents of W and Te in the compound are 33.17 and 66.83 at %, respectively. Thus, the chemical 
compositio n of the single crystal corresponds to the stoichiometric ratio WTe 2. 
 2.2. Techniques for measuring kinetic properties  
The resistivity and the Hall effect were measured  using the four -contact method in the 
temperature range from 12 to 200 K and in magnetic fields up to 9 T  on a PPMS -9 universal system 
for measuring physical  properties (Quantum Design, USA) at the TC NTAM  of the Institute of 
Metal Physics, Ural Branch, Russian  Academy of Sciences. The electrical contacts  were prepared 
using thin copper wire and silver paste.  Measurements were performed with an electric current  
that flowed in the (001) plane and the magnetic  field direction perpendicular to this plane. The 
ratio of  resistivities of the WTe
2 single crystal under study at  room and helium  temperatures is 
œÅ300 K/œÅ4.2 K ‚âà 55, which indicates its high electrical purity.  
In this study, the electrical resistivity in the absence  of a magnetic field is denoted by œÅ  or 
œÅ(0), the magnetoresistivity  is denoted as ŒîœÅ xx = œÅ(B) ‚Äì œÅ(0) (where  œÅ(B) is the resistivity in 
magnetic field B ), and the Hall  resistivity is denoted by œÅ H. For ease of interpretation and presentation of experimental results, some of  them are given in the form of magnetoconductivity  
œÉxx=‚àÜœÅxx/(‚àÜœÅxx2+œÅH2). 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Electrical  resistivity  
Fig. 5  shows t he temperature dependence of the electrical  resistivity  œÅ(T) of the WTe 2 single 
crystal . In the temperature range from 12 to 70 K, this  depende nce can be expressed as follows  
ùúåùúå=ùúåùúå0+ùê¥ùê¥ùëáùëá2.       (1) 
The quadratic temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity was observed in pure metals 
[16]. As a rule, the contribution ~ T2 is associated with electron ‚Äìelectron scattering that is usually 
observed at temperatures below 10‚Äì15 K [16, 17]. At higher temperatures, electron‚Äìphonon scattering mechanism should prevail, which leads to the dependence œÅ( T) ~ T
5 at T << Œò D (ŒòD is 
the Deb ye temperature) and to the linear dependence œÅ( T) at temperatures comparable to Œò D. The 
Debye temperature for WTe 2 is 133.8 ¬± 0.06 K [18]. In our case, the resistivity contribution 
proportional to T5 is not observed at low temperatures T  << Œò D, i.e., the B loch‚ÄìGr√ºneisen law is 
not followed. 
The quadratic behavior of the dependence  œÅ(T) at temperatures between 12 K and 70  K can 
be explained as follows. According to Drude formula, the  conductivity can be expressed as  
ùúéùúé=ùëõùëõùëíùëí2ùúèùúè
ùëöùëö=ùëõùëõùëíùëí2ùëôùëô
ùëöùëöùëöùëö,     (2) 
where n is the concentration of current carriers; e is the  elementary charge; œÑ  is the relaxation time; 
m is the  electron mass; and l and v are the mean free path and  the velocity of conduction electrons, 
respectively. In  [19], the l value was estimated for our crystal, and it  was demonstrated that the 
mean free path is l = const + C T‚Äì2 in the temperature region ( 24‚Äì55)  K, which is consistent with 
the quadratic behavior of the  dependence of the electrical resistivity at temperatures  up to 70 K. It 
can be assumed that contributions from  various scattering mechanisms lead to the quadratic nature 
of the dependence  œÅ(T) due to the peculiarities  of the electronic structure of WTe 2 at T ‚â§ 70 K. 
This should also manifest itself in the resistivity (conductivity)  measured in the presence of a 
magnetic  field.  
 
3.2. Magnetoresistivity  
Fig. 6a shows the f ield dependence of the magnetoresistivity  ŒîœÅxx = œÅ(B) ‚Äì œÅ(0) of the WTe 2 
single crystal  at a temperature of T = 12 K. As can be seen  from Fig. 6a, the magnetoresistivity 
ŒîœÅxx varies with variation  of the field accord ing to  a law close to quadratic ŒîœÅxx ~ Bn, where 
n ‚âà 1.93 ¬± 0.01. Such behavior is typical for compensated conductors with a  closed Fermi surface 
in the region of high effective  magnetic fields ( œâcœÑ >> 1, where œâ c is the cyclotron frequency)  [17]. 
Fig. 6b shows the t emperature dependence of the resistivity  œÅ(T) of the WTe 2 single crystal 
in a magnetic field of 9 T . There is a minimum in the œÅ (T) curve. A similar dependence was 
observed, for example, in tungsten single crystals [20], in which the presence  of a minimum is 
explained by the transition from  high effective magnetic fields to weak  ones. According  to [17], 
the conductivity of a compensated metal with a closed Fermi surface in the region of high effective  
magnetic fields ( œâcœÑ >> 1) is determined by the contributions  from various scattering mechanisms. 
Therefore,  it is more convenient to carry out further analysis  on the basis of the dependence of conductivity œÉxx in a magnetic field. To simplify the calculations, the formula  of œÉxx for the case of 
an isotropic crystal is further  used, in which œÉ xx is related to components ŒîœÅ xx and œÅH of the 
resistivity tensor as  œÉxx=‚àÜœÅxx/(‚àÜœÅxx2+œÅH2). The dependence of œÉ xx on T2 is shown in the inset of Fig. 
6b, from which one can see  that conductivity œÉ xx in a magnetic field also changes  with temperature 
according to a quadratic law, but  in a narrower temperature range from 12 to  about 55 K when 
compared to electrical resistivity.  Thus, quadratic temperature dependences are  observed for both 
the electrical resistivity in the  absence of a magnetic field and the conductivity in a  magnetic field, 
which is apparently associated with  contributions from various scattering mechanisms. 
 
3.3. The Hall effect  
Fig. 7a shows the temperature dependences of  the Hall coefficient R H, and the concentration 
n and mobility Œº of the main charge carriers in  the WTe 2 single crystal that were obtained within 
of a single -band model by formulas  
ùëÖùëÖùêªùêª=ùúåùúåùêªùêª
ùêµùêµ,  (3) 
ùëõùëõ=1
ùëÖùëÖùêªùêª‚ãÖùëíùëí,  (4) 
ùúáùúá=ùëÖùëÖùêªùêª
ùúåùúå.  (5) 
Given that R H < 0, the main charge carriers are electrons with the concentration of 
n ‚âà 5.3 √ó  1019 cm-3 and the mobility of Œº ‚âà 5.9 √ó 103 cm2/(V s) at T  = 12 K. The n value determined 
by formula (4) changes weakly with temperature, which is typical for a number of compensated 
conductors with a closed Fermi surface [21, 22]. At the same time, the mobility Œº calculated by formula (5) strongly decreases with temperature, which can be explained by an increase in the 
scattering efficiency of current carriers.  
As was shown in [19], the Hall resistivity œÅ
H of WTe 2 is nonlinearly dependent on the 
magnetic field B . It is  assumed that such behavior of the dependence  œÅH(B) may be related to the 
mechanism of scattering of conduction electrons on the sample surface. This was  observed in [23, 
24] whe re compensated metals with a  closed Fermi surface were investigated under conditions  of 
a static skin effect. A strongly nonlinear  depend ence of œÅ H on the field in WTe 2 was also  observed 
at low temperatures in [14, 25], which was  explained by the presence of current carriers of the  
electron and hole types. In systems containing electron and hole charge carriers, a two -band model 
is typicall y used to analyze the field dependences of  resistivity œÅ in a magnetic field and Hall 
resistivity œÅ H. The expressions for œÅ  and œÅ H are written in the following form  given in [14]  
œÅ=1

where ne (Œºe) and n h (Œºh) are the concentration (mobilities)  of electrons and holes, respectively. As 
shown in Fig. 7b, the field dependences of the resistivity œÅ (B) in a magnetic field and the Hall 
resistivity  œÅH(B) for WTe 2 at 12 K were described using the two- band model by formulas (6)  and 
(7), respectively. The following values of the concentrations and mobilities of electrons and holes 
were obtained: ne = (3.14 ¬± 0.01) √ó 1019 cm-3, nh = (2.78 ¬±  0.01)  √ó 1019 cm‚Äì3, 
Œºe = (4.77 ¬±  0.02)  √ó 103 cm2/(V s), and Œº h = (3.42 ¬±  0.01)  √ó 103 cm2/(V s). Proportion n e ‚âà nh 
points to electron‚Äìhole compensation in WTe 2. 
Thus, estimates of the concentrations and mobilities of current carriers obtained using both  
single -band and two- band models are in good agreement with each other. This also applies to the values of the Hall coefficient, which equal  RH = ‚Äì1.168 √ó 10‚Äì1 cm3/C and RH = ‚Äì1.170 √ó 10‚Äì1 cm3/C 
in the case of  single -band  and two -band model s, respectively . 
 
4. Conclusions  
Studies of the kinetic properties of the topological  semimetal WTe 2 single crystal have 
shown that both the electrical resistivity in the absence of a magnetic field  and the conductivity in 
the field depend on a temperature according to the quadratic law in a wide temperature range from 
12 K to 70 and 55 K, respectively. This appears to be associated with  the contributions from 
various scattering me chanisms.  
As a result of the analysis of experimental data on the Hall effect and the resistivity in a 
magnetic field, the concentrations and mobilities of current carriers in WTe 2 were estimated using 
both single -band and two -band models. These results are in good correlation and point to electron‚Äì
hole compensation with a slight predominance of electron charge carriers.
