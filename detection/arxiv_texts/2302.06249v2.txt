Abstract
We analyze the thermodynamics of spherically symmetric thi n-shell solutions to Einstein’s equa-
tions, including solutions with negative interior mass. We show the inclusion of such solutions is
essential for the thermodynamic consistency of the system: the Maximum Energy Principle applies
when we include an entropy term from the singularity of the ne gative-mass solutions, in addition
to the Bekenstein-Hawking term for the entropy of solutions with positive interior mass. Then, the
thermodynamic analysis leads to four distinct thermodynam ic phases. We also show that all types
of solutions can be either thermodynamically stable or dyna mically stable, but only solutions with
zero interior mass can be both. Since most of our results are a nalytic, thin shell models emerge
as a useful theoretical paradigm for exploring gravitation al thermodynamics. Our results provide
an additional argument in support of the assignment of entro py to the singularity of negative-
mass Schwarzschild spacetimes, and, consequently, to Penr ose’s conjecture about the assignment of
entropy to singularities.
1 Introduction
The characterization of black holes as thermodynamic objects by B ekenstein [1] and Hawking [2] has
raised many foundational questions on the relation between gravit y and thermodynamics [3–5]. These
include the possibility of deﬁning gravitational entropy in spacetimes that do not involve horizons, and
the incorporation of both gravitational and matter entropy into a consistent theoretical framework, as
it is suggested by the generalized second law of thermodynamics (GS L) [6].
In this paper, we address these issues in one of the simplest gravita tional systems, a spherically
symmetric gravitating thin shell [7–11]. Thin shells provide elementar y models for many aspects of
gravitational physics including gravitational collapse [12–15], quant um gravity [16,17], and black hole
thermodynamics [19–21]. Here, we analyse the thermodynamical pr operties of the most general static
thin-shell solutions. These include solutions in which the interior of th e shell is a Schwarzschild space-
time with negative mass, that is characterized by a naked singularity at the center. We ﬁnd that the
thermodynamics of the thin shell are consistent only if we include into the total entropy a speciﬁc con-
tribution from the singularity that is determined uniquely. The result ing thermodynamic system admits
diﬀerent thermodynamic phases that correspond to positive, zer o or negative mass of the solution inside
the shell.
There are three distinct motivations for this work. The ﬁrst one is P enrose’s proposal that spacetime
singularities may be carriers of entropy. In Refs. [22,23], it was sh own that self-gravitating radiation
in a spherical box has a consistent thermodynamic description only if one assigns a speciﬁc value of
entropy to the singular solutions to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volko ﬀ equations. This result was later
generalized for a box with an internal boundary, i.e., for a thick shell of radiation. These singular
∗d.kotopoulis@upatras.gr
†anastop@upatras.gr
1solutions are not speciﬁc to radiation, they are generic to Tolman-O ppenheimer-Volkoﬀ equations for
any thermodynamically consistent equation of state (EoS) [24]. The singularities are locally isometric to
the singularities of Schwarzschild spacetime with negative mass, and they are relatively benign, as the
spacetime is bounded-acceleration complete. Thin shells provide a sim pler set-up for a thermodynamic
analysis, allowing for analytic proofs and for a precise derivation of t he entropy terms for singularities.
Second, the thin-shell system also provides a simple model for phas e transitions between black holes
and self-gravitating systems. The most well known case of such a t ransition is the Hawking-Page phase
transition between black holes and radiation [25], albeit in asymptotica lly anti de Sitter spacetimes.
In asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes, phase transitions have been stu died by comparing the entropy of a
Schwarzschild black hole in a box with the entropy of radiation in the bo x [26–31]. However, with the
exception of Ref. [31], the matter degrees of freedom in these ana lyses are non-gravitating, i.e., they do
not correspond to solutions of Einstein’s equations. In contrast, the thin-shell models considered here
are genuine solutions to Einstein’s equations. Furthermore, they c an incorporate a variety of diﬀerent
behaviors by changing the EoS, and they are analytically tractable.
Our third motivation is the physics of non-extensive thermodynamic systems in equilibrium. Non-
extensivity appears when the range of interacting forces is larger than the size of the system. This
is possible either in small systems with short-range forces, or in pre sence of long-range forces [32,33],
such as gravity [34–36]. Non-extensive systems are spatially inhomo geneous even in equilibrium, their
micro-canonical and canonical ensembles are inequivalent [35,37], a nd their entropy function may not
be concave (hence, heat capacities may be negative). Thin shells pr ovide a class of analytically solvable
models in General Relativity, and they can be employed in order to inve stigate axiomatic approaches
towards gravitational thermodynamics [38,39].
In our analysis, we consider static, spherically symmetric thin-shell solutions to Einstein’s equations.
The thin-shell lies between two regions of Schwarzschild geometry w ith diﬀerent masses. The mass M
of the external region is the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass a nd it can only be positive, while the
massM0of the interior region can take any real value. For M0>0, the interior solution is a black hole;
forM0= 0, the interior solution is ﬂat; and for M0<0, the interior solution has a naked singularity.
For a given equation of state, the space of thin-shell solutions is tw o-dimensional. It is determined by
MandM0, or equivalently by Mand the temperature at inﬁnity T∞. However, from a thermodynamic
pointofview,energyandtemperaturearenotindependentvariab les. Forexample, inthemicrocanonical
distribution, the energy Mis ﬁxed and the corresponding temperature is deﬁned as a derivativ e of the
entropy functional. This means that not all solutions correspond t o equilibrium conﬁgurations. In
equilibrium thermodynamics, the latter are determined by recourse to the Maximum Entropy Principle:
an equilibrium conﬁguration is deﬁned as the maximum of the entropy o f ﬁxed total energy M[40].
The problem is that in thin shells, as well as in other self-gravitating sy stems, matter entropy has
no global maxima at ﬁxed energy. This means that the Maximum Entro py Principle does not apply.
At face value, this would mean that all thin-shell solutions are therm odynamically unstable: they tend
to collapse to their Schwarzschild radius, even in the regime of very s mall masses. The only way to
obtain a consistent equilibrium conﬁguration is by adding an entropy c ontribution to solutions with
negative M0. Because of the simplicity of the system, we can evaluate this entro py term analytically. It
is independent of the shell EoS equation, and it is compatible with the c orresponding term for solutions
to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ equation [22].
Weﬁndthatthe equilibriumconﬁgurationsatgiven Mcorrespondtoﬂatinteriorsolutions( M0= 0),
whenever such solutions exist. When including the Bekenstein-Hawk ing entropy of horizons for M0>0,
we ﬁnd that the system is characterized by four distinct phases, d epending on the sign of M0: a regular
phase (M0= 0), a black-hole phase ( M0>0), and two distinct naked singularity phases ( M0<0),
one characterized by ﬁnite temperature at inﬁnity and the other b y zero temperature at inﬁnity. We
analyze the properties of these phases and the associated phase transitions.
Finally, we discuss thermodynamic stability in relation to dynamical sta bility. While solutions of all
types can be either dynamically stable or thermodynamically stable, w e have found that only solutions
withM0= 0 can be both. In particular, we show that thermodynamically stab le solutions with M0>0
2fail to be dynamically stable for all EoS. We also have found no solution that is both dynamically and
thermodynamically stable for M0<0, even though we lack a proof that is valid for any EoS.
The structure of this paper is the following. In Sec. 2, we analyze th e geometry of thin-shell
solutions for general equations of state. In Sec. 3, we analyze th e thermodynamic consistency of
thin-shell solutions, we identify the entropy term associated to na ked singularities, and analyze the
thermodynamic phases of the system and their properties. In Sec . 4, we present the thermodynamical
statesofthesystemandtheanalysisofdynamicalstability. Inthe conclusions,wediscussandsummarize
our results.
2 Spacetime geometry for a self-gravitating thin shell
2.1 Equilibrium conditions
A static, spherically symmetric spacetime containing a thin shell of ar ea 4πR2is described by the metric
ds2=−L(r)2dt2+dr2
1−2m(r)
r+r2(dθ2+sin2θdφ2), (1)
whereL(r) is the lapse function, m(r) is the mass function and ( t,r,θ,φ) is the usual coordinate system.
Forr > R, the metric is Schwarzschild with ADM mass M, i.e.,
L(r) =/radicalbigg
1−2M
r, m(r) =M. (2)
Forr < R, the the metric is Schwarzschild with “mass” M0, i.e.,
L(r) =κ
κ0/radicalbigg
1−2M0
r, m(r) =M0, (3)
where
κ:=/radicalbig
1−2M/R, κ 0:=/radicalbig
1−2M0/R. (4)
We assume that the ADM mass of the solution is positive, i.e., that M >0. The parameter M0is
deﬁned only in the interior, so it has no interpretation of total ener gy. It is therefore unconstrained.
Hence,κtakes values in (0 ,1], while κ0takes values in (0 ,∞).
The thin-shell junction conditions [8,9] lead to the structure equa tions
κκ0(1+4P/σ) = 1, (5)
κ0−κ= 4πRσ, (6)
whereσandPstand for the shell’s surface density and pressure, respectively. They are not independent
variables, as they are related by an EoS. We assume that they satis fy the conditions σ≥P≥0, and
1≥dP/dσ≥0.
2.2 Characterization of solutions
We use Eqs. (4) and (5), in order to eliminate the dependence on κ0andRfrom Eq. (6). Then, we
obtain a fourth-order algebraic equation for κ,
Φ(κ) :=Aκ4−(1+A)κ2−Bκ+1 = 0, (7)
whereA:= 1+4P/σandB:= 8πMσ(1+4P/σ). In the Appendix A, we prove that Eq. (7) admits a
unique solution κ∈(0,1) for any A,B >0.
3Thus the space Zof solutions to Eqs. (5) and (6) is parameterized by the variables M,A,andB,
i.e. by the variables M,σ,andP, the latter two being related by an EoS.
The elements of Zare of three types, depending on the sign of M0:=m(0).
•M0= 0: Type F (ﬂat): κ0= 1; Minkowski spacetime for r < R.
•M0>0: Type B (black-hole): κ0<1; it contains a Schwarzschild horizon at r= 2M0.
•M0<0: Type S (singularity): κ0>1; it contains a negative-mass Schwarzschild singularity at
r= 0.
F-type solutions are determined by the equation K(σ,P) =M, where
K(σ,P) :=4(1+2P
σ)
π(1+4P
σ)3P2
σ3. (8)
Invoking continuity, it is straightforward to prove that M < K (σ,P) for all B-type solutions and
M > K(σ,P) for all S-type solutions.
Sinceσ≥Pfor all physical equations of state, lim P→∞K(σ,P) = 0. Furthermore, if lim P→0P2/σ3
is ﬁnite, then K(σ,P) has a global maximum MOV:= maxK(σ,P). ForM > M OV, all solutions are of
type S, i.e., there are no ﬂat solutions. In this sense, MOVis the analogue of the Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ
limit in stellar models, which justiﬁes the notation.
In contrast, if lim P→0P2/σ3=∞thenK(σ,P) has no global maximum and there exists no
Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ limit: there exist F-type and B-type solutions f or all masses M.
The asymptotic behavior of the solutions is the following.
•σ,P→ ∞with constant P/σ:B→ ∞, whileAremains constant. Hence, Φ( κ)≃ −Bκ+1, so
the solution to Eq. (7) is κ=B−1∼σ−1. By Eq. (5), κ0=B/A∼σ, and the solution is of type
S.
•σ,P→0 with constant P/σ: Φ(κ) =Aκ4−(1+A)κ2+1, which implies that κ=A−1/2. In this
limit,R→2M/parenleftbig
1+σ
4P/parenrightbig
is a constant, and κ0=A−1/2<1, so the solution is of type B.
•σ,P→0 withP/σ→0:R→ ∞,κ= 1 and −M≤M0≤Mthe exact value being determined
by the asymptotic behaviour of σ3/P2. For details, see the Appendix B.
2.3 Stability of solutions
As shown in Refs. [9,41], a thin-shell solution is stable under small per turbations if the function
Ψ(κ,κ0,β) := 4κ2κ2
0(1+3κκ0)β+3κ3κ3
0−(κ2+κκ0+κ2
0). (9)
is positive; β=dP/dσis the square root of the speed of sound in the shell. Dynamical stab ility of thin
shell solutions has been studied in [41], but past studies did not cover the case of M0<0.
To analyze dynamical stability, it is convenient to parameterize the s pace of solutions by κandκ0.
By deﬁnition κ <1, andκ < κ0. Also, by Eq. (5), κκ0=A−1. SinceA= 1+4P/σ∈[0,5], the physical
solutions lie between the hyperbolae κκ0= 1 and κκ0= 1/5. The portion of the κ−κ0plane with
physical solution is drawn in white in Fig. 1, where we also plot the limiting c urve deﬁned by Eq. (9).
Stable solutions lie in the concave side of the limiting curve. We see that there exist stable solutions
also forκ0>1.
An interesting feature of the stability analysis is that the F-type so lution for M=MOValways lies
on the curve Ψ = 0. This is straightforward to show. The maximum of Mis obtained by the condition
d
dσK(σ,P) = 0, which implies that Ψ = 0.

Matterincompactstarsisexpectedtobeapproximatelypolytropic atsuﬃcientlylowtemperatures/pressures,
whileallequationsofstateareexpectedtobeultrarelativisticatsu ﬃcientlyhightemperatures/pressures.
Gratton’s EoS [42,43] interpolates between a polytropic EoS at low p ressures and a linear one at high
pressure.
A large part of our analysis will apply to general equations of state. However, for some calculations
or plots, we will work with the two dimensional analogue of Gratton’s E oS, namely,
σ=σr(P/σr)γ+aP (10)
whereσris some reference density, a≥1 andγ∈(0,1). Forσ≪σr, the EoS is polytropic, while for
σ≫σrthe linear term prevails.
In what follows, we use the system of units where c=G=σr=kB= 1. In these units, all physical
magnitudes are dimensionless. We chose this system, rather than t he natural one with /planckover2pi1= 1, because it
is more convenient in the, essentially classical, thermodynamic analys is of the system, and because we
want to keep /planckover2pi1when introducing the Bekenstein-Hawking contribution to entropy , which incorporates
quantum eﬀects.
Given an EoS, the space Zof equilibrium conﬁgurations can be parameterized by ( M,P). Then,
F-type solutions deﬁne a curve on the P−Mplane,the F-curve . The F-curve has a global maximum
if limP→0P2/σ3is ﬁnite, which for EoS (10) amounts to γ≤2/3.
In Fig. 2 we plot the F-curve for diﬀerent values of γ <2/3, as well as the curve that separates
between stable and unstable conﬁgurations on the P−Mplane. The latter intersects the F-curve
always at the maximum, i.e. at M=MOV. In Fig. 3, we plot the F-curve for diﬀerent values of γon
theP−Mplane. In this case there are no dynamically stable conﬁgurations. W ith the exception of
the marginal case γ= 2/3 theF-curve is unbounded from above.

γ= 1/3 (right). B-type conﬁgurations lie between the F-curve and the horizontal axis. The remaining
conﬁgurations are of S-type. Dynamically stable conﬁgurations lie b etween the dashed curve and the
horizontal axis. The dashed curve meets the F-curve at the maximum.

conﬁgurations are of S-type. There are no dynamically stable conﬁgurations. The F-curve does not
possess a global maximum with the exception of the marginal case γ= 2/3 where it asymptotically
approaches the limiting value M= 4/π.

three types of ﬁbers, which we denote as I, II and III.
6•Fibers of type I are deﬁned by γ <2/3 andM < M OV(γ). The line M= constant intersects
theF-curve twice. Hence, these ﬁbers involve two F-type solutions, on e atP=P1which is
dynamically stable and one at P=P2> P1which is dynamically unstable. Solutions in the
interval ( P1,P2) are B-type. The remaining solutions are of type S.
•Fibers of type II are deﬁned by γ <2/3 andM > M OV(γ). They contain only S-type solutions .
•Fibers of type III are deﬁned by γ >2/3. The line M= constant intersects the F-curve only once,
at some point P1. The solutions for P < P 1are B-type solutions, and the solutions for P > P 1,
are S-type. It is straightforward to show that ﬁber III conﬁgur ations are dynamically unstable.
In the following, we will only consider EoS that have no type III ﬁbers . We will therefore employ
Gratton’s EoS for γ <2/3.
3 Thermodynamic consistency and Entropy of Singularities
3.1 Thermodynamic properties of the EoS
We proceed with an analysis the thermodynamic properties of the Eo S. We assume that the shell
consists of a ﬂuid with kparticle species. The thermodynamic state space for this ﬂuid is deﬁ ned by
the particle-number densities na, a= 1,2,...,kand the surface energy density σ. All thermodynamic
properties are encoded in the entropy density function s(σ,na). The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics for
surface density variables takes the form

By the maximum entropy principle, the equilibrium conﬁguration for an y self-gravitating system is
characterized by spatially constant values of the parameters ba[24,44]. Then, Eqs. (13) and (14) imply

73.2 The maximum entropy principle for a thin shell
We deﬁne the free entropy Ω of any thermodynamic system as the L egendre transform of the entropy
functional Swith respect to the total particle numbers for each species Na, Ω =S+/summationtext
abaNa. The
free entropy is a Massieu potential, and a function of baand the total energy Mof the system. The
quantity ωof Eq. (14) is the (surface) density associated to Ω. The free-en tropy representation is
natural for self-gravitating systems, because of the constanc y of theba. In this representation, both P
andσare functions of the temperature Tandba, whereTvaries in the interior of a self-gravitating
system. The EoS employed in Einstein’s equation is obtained by eliminatin gT. The EoS carries an
implicit dependence on the ba’s. For example, the coeﬃcients γandσcof Gratton’s EoS are to be
thought as functions of the ba’s.
The free entropy of a spherical thin shell is given by
Ωshell:= 4πR2ω= 4πR2σ+P
T. (17)
The free entropy Ω shellis a function of M,σand the activities ba. However, the thermodynamic
space for this system depends only on Mandba,σis an unconstrained parameter. In equilibrium
thermodynamics, the value of unconstrained parameters is deter mined by recourse to the Maximum
Entropy Principle (MEP). In the free-entropy representation, t he MEP translates into the statement
that unconstrained parametersare determined by the maximizatio n of Ω for ﬁxed mass Mand activities
ba. Since the ba’s are not aﬀected in the implementation of the MEP, we will drop any re ference to
them, and consider Ω shellonly as a function of Mandσ.
To explain the notion of an unconstrained parameter in this context , note that we can equivalently
express Ω shellas a function of MandM0. If we only ﬁx M, we assume a self-gravitating system
with ﬁxed energy that will move spontaneously into a state of therm al equilibrium. The value of
M0in equilibrium will then be ﬁxed by the MEP. Of course, we expect that t he natural equilibrium
conﬁguration for suﬃciently small mass will be of the F-type, i.e., the interior spacetime will be ﬂat.
This will eventually be borne out by our analysis. Analogous propertie s hold for systems with bulk
matter: the space of solutions is larger than the space of equilibrium conﬁgurations, the latter being
obtained by recourse to the MEP [22].
The problem is that Ω shelldoes not have a global maximum. This is a generic feature of self-
gravitating systems, related to the so-called gravothermal cata strophe. One reason for working with
thin shells is that they allow for a simple analytic proof of this statemen t.
Eq. (16) implies that Pdiverges at least with T2for large T, and so does σ≥P. By Eq. (7),
κ∼σ−1in this limit, hence Rapproaches 2 M. It follows that Ω shelldiverges at least with T, for large
T. Hence, Ω shellhas no global maximum and the MEP fails. If this were true, even a thin -shell with
very little mass, would spontaneously collapse towards its Schwarzs child radius, in order to maximize
entropy.
In Ref. [22], it was proposed that analogous problems can be resolve d by including an entropy con-
tribution from the singularities of the S-type solutions. The idea tha t singularities are entropic objects
originates from Penrose. The natural value from the singularity en tropy can be inferred from Wald’s
formulationofblack hole entropyin terms ofthe Noether charge Q(ξ) ofspacetime diﬀeomorphisms [45],
S=Q(ξ)
T∞, (18)
whereT∞is the temperature measured at inﬁnity. Note that the Noether ch arge of spacetime diﬀeo-
morphisms is always a surface term. The bulk contribution vanishes f or any local symmetry, so the
Noether charge is deﬁned on the spacetime boundaries.
The Noether charge Q(ξ) is deﬁned in terms of the time-like Killing vector ξ=∂
∂t, normalized so
thatξµξµ=−1 at inﬁnity, and evaluated on any boundary of the surfaces of con stantt:
Q(ξ) =λ
4π/contintegraldisplay
∂Σdσµν∇µξν, (19)
8whereλis an arbitrary multiplicative constant.
For positive-mass Schwarzschild spacetime, Q(ξ) = 2λM, when evaluated at the horizon. Since
T∞= 1/(8πM), the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy SBH= 4πM2is obtained for λ=1
4. For negative-
mass Schwarzschild spacetime, the singularity at r= 0 deﬁnes a timelike boundary, for which Q(ξ) =
2λM0κ/κ0. There is no ﬁrst-principles derivation of the constant λ. However, the analysis of diﬀerent
systems has shown that the value λ= 2 is the only one that allows for a consistent implementation of
the MEP in self-gravitating systems. Notably, this value works for d iﬀerent EoS, and it is not model
dependent.
Here, for κ0>1, we add a term
Ωsing:=2λM0
Tκ0=λR
T/parenleftbigg1
κ0−κ0/parenrightbigg
, (20)
to the free energy of the shell, so that the total free entropy Ω o f the system is
Ω := Ω shell+θ(κ0−1)Ωsing=R
T/bracketleftbig
4πR(P+σ)+λθ(κ0−1)(κ−1
0−κ0)/bracketrightbig
, (21)
whereθ(x) is the step function. There is zero contribution from Ω singforκ0≤1.
Hence, by Eq. (6)
Ω =R
T/bracketleftbig
4πR(P+σ)+λθ(κ0−1)(κ−1
0−κ−4πRσ)/bracketrightbig
.
For large T,R→2Mand (λ
κ0−λκ)∼σ−1→0. Hence, Ω behaves asymptotically as
Ω∞= 16πM2(1−λ)σ+P
T. (22)
By the dominant energy condition P≤σ, hence, Ω ∞≤16πM2(2−λ)σ
T. Forλ >2, Ω∞→ −∞, and the
MEP is restored. However, the fact that Ω becomes unbounded fr om below is unphysical, as it would
imply negative entropy, in contradiction to the statistical interpre tation of entropy1. The case λ= 2 is
the only one possible that can lead to a ﬁnite value of Ω ∞, and be compatible with both the MEP and
the positivity of entropy. Hence, as in the case of bulk gravitating s ystem, the value of λ= 2 for the
entropy of the singularity is preferred.
Wemustnote, however,thatthecasefor λ= 2inthin shellsisslightlyweakerthanthecorresponding
case of bulk matter2. Suppose that the asymptotic ratio P/σin the EoS is a constant, which we denote
bya. The dominant energy condition implies that a≤1, while by the positivity of pressure, a >0.
Then, asymptotically, Ω ∞= 16πM2(1+a−λ)σ
T. It follows that the preferred value of λis 1+a. We have
to assume a universal asymptotic ratio a= 1, in order to derive λ= 2. While the existence of such a
ratio appears plausible, we have found no fundamental justiﬁcatio n. In practice, this is not a constraint.
If an EoS applies up for all temperatures up to a T1, we can simply extrapolate it for T > T 1, so that
the asymptotic behavior P=σapplies in the limit T→ ∞. Then, by construction, Ω ∞= 0 forλ= 2.
It is straightforward to show that Ω is either ﬁnite or it vanishes at t he limit T→0. Hence, there
is no problem with the implementation of the MEP at low temperatures.
1A negative value of entropy that is bounded from below would n ot be a problem, as the MEP is invariant under an
aﬃne transformation S→aS+b, fora >0, that can be used to always render the entropy positive.
2The reason for this diﬀerence is that in general the EoS for a t wo dimensional system cannot be read from the EoS
from a three-dimensional system at a limit where one dimensi on vanishes. Hence, results obtained with a thin shell of
ﬁnite width with a 3-d EoS do not coincide with the results obt ained from a genuinely 2-d shell.
93.3 F-type solutions
For F-type solutions, κ=A−1whereA= 1 + 4P/σ. By Eq. (7), B= (A−1)2(A+ 1)/A2, and
consequently 8 πMσ= (A−1)2(A+1)/A3. We straightforwardly calculate
Ωshell=16πM2σ(1+P/σ)
T=M
TA(A+3)
2(A+1). (23)
SinceA∈[1,5], we obtain the bounds
M
T≤Ωshell≤10
3M
T. (24)
Analogous bounds exist for general self-gravitating regular solut ions to Einstein’s equations.
A key result of our analysis is that the maxima of Ω for ﬁxed Mcorrespond to type-F solutions. To
show this, we note that for F-type solutions,
δΩshell= Ωshell/parenleftbigg4A
A2−1δκ+δσ
σ+P/parenrightbigg
, (25)
δΩsing=−2λR
Tθ(δκ0)δκ0. (26)
We proceed to express δΩshellin terms of δκ0. To this end, we note that δκfor a static conﬁguration
is obtained by the requirement that∂Φ
∂κδκ+∂Φ
∂AδA+∂Φ
∂BδB= 0. From the deﬁnition of B,δB=
(B/σ)δσ+(B/A)δA. Also for F-type solutions κ=A−1hence Eq (7) implies B=(A−1)2(1+A)
A2. We
thus obtain
δκ=−(1+A)
A(3+2A+A2)δA−(A−1)(A+1)
A(3+2A+A2)δσ
σ. (27)
We can also express δσ/σin terms of δA,
δσ
σ=δA
4β+1−A, (28)
whereβ=dP
dσ. By Eq. (5), δκ0=−Aδκ−δA
A. Using Eqs. (27) and (28), we obtain
δκ0=−A3+A2+A−3−12β−4βA
A(A−1−4β)(3+2A+A2)δA. (29)
We substitute Eq. (29) and (28) into Eq. (25), to obtain the remar kably simple result,
δΩshell= Ωshell4A
(A+3)(A−1)δκ0=R
Tδκ0. (30)
Hence, for any F-type solution,
δΩ =R
T[1−2λθ(δκ0)]δκ0. (31)
It follows that δΩ<0, for all δκ0, as long as λ >1
2. The introduction of the singularity entropy
guarantees that type F solutions are local maxima of Ω.

3.4 Example: Gratton EoS
Next, we demonstrate our results above for the EoS (10). By Eq. (15),
P=/bracketleftbig(T/Tc)(1+a)(1−γ)−1
1+a/bracketrightbig1
1−γ. (32)
whereTcis a constant of integration. The EoS cannot be extended to tempe ratures smaller than Tc.
In principle, this means that the EoS (10) fails as Tapproaches Tc, and we have to deform it so that
the functions P(T) andσ(T) can be extended to T= 0. Since Tcis an arbitrary constant, we can take
it so small that the EoS applies arbitrarily close to T= 0. Then, the free entropy becomes
Ω = 16πM2/bracketleftbigg(1+a−aλ)T
(1+a)1
1−γT1+ac+(1−λ)Tγ(1+a)−1
(1+a)γ
1−γTγ(1+a)
c/bracketrightbigg
. (33)
The asymptotic behaviour of Ω at large Tforλ= 2 is shown in Table 1. The MEP fails only for
a <1, in which case the EoS violates the dominant energy conditions. The casea >1 violates entropy
positivity, since Ω is unbounded from below. The only physical case co rresponds to the asymptotic
behavior P=σfor the EoS. However, even in this case, subdominant terms in Ω lead to violation of
entropy positivity, unless γ≤1
2.
As shown in Sec. 3.3, F-type solutions correspond to local maxima of the free entropy Ω, for all EoS.
For Gratton’s EoS, this behavior is demonstrated graphically in Fig. 5 . However, not all local maxima
are F-type solutions. As explained in Sec. 2.3, there exist no F-type solutions for M > M OV, hence,
forM > M OVlocal maxima are S-type solutions.
By Eq. (24), F-type solutions have strictly positive free entropy Ω . This is not the case for S-type
solutions, even the equilibrium conﬁgurations may have Ω <0. In this case, the global maximum of
entropy is Ω ∞= 0, and it is achieved for T→ ∞—see Fig. 6. Strictly speaking, this means that the
MEP fails in this situation. However, the entropy diﬀerence between such solutions is negligible, and
they all correspond to the same geometry: the shell arbitrarily clo se to the horizon, very large energy
density balanced by a large negative value of M0. Even if the local temperature Tdiverges, the entropy
at inﬁnity T∞=Tκtends to zero. If we assume a length cut-oﬀ in the admissible proper distance of
the shell from its Schwarzschild horizon (say the Planck length), th en there is indeed a state of maximal
entropy very close to zero, that describes a thin shell at almost Sc hwarzschild radius. They are broadly
similar to the conﬁgurations proposed for the membrane paradigm o r the brick wall model for black
holes, the main diﬀerence being that they are objects of almost zer o entropy and temperature. We will
refer to such asymptotic equilibrium solutions as being of the SII typ e; we will refer to S-type solutions
at ﬁnite temperature as SI solutions.

4 Thermodynamic phases and stability
4.1 Phase diagrams
In the previous section, we showed that the introduction of a singu larity entropy term is necessary in
order to (i) enable the implementation of the MEP, and (ii) to guarant ee that F-type solutions are
equilibrium conﬁgurations for low ADM masses, in accordance with our expectations from Newtonian
gravity. However, we ignored the entropy contributions from the horizon of the B-type solutions, i.e.,
their Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Without an entropy contribut ion from the horizon, B-type solutions
cannot dominate thermodynamically, as seen in Sec. 3, only F-type a nd S-type solutions maximize
entropy.
12We incorporate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, by adding a term
ΩBH:= 4πM2
0//planckover2pi1 (34)
to the free energy for M0>0. This is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy associated to the horizo n inside
the black hole. The total free energy of a solution takes the form
Ω =/braceleftBigg
Ωmatt+ΩBH, M0>0
Ωmatt+Ωsing, M0<0.(35)
With this expression for free energy, the free entropy along a ﬁbe r of constant Mbehaves as follows.
•ForM < M OV, there are four local maxima of Ω, two correspond to F-type solut ions, one to a
B-type solution and one to an SII solution.
•ForM > M OV, there are two local maxima of Ω, one at a SI solution and one at a SII solution.
In equilibrium thermodynamics, local maxima of entropy correspond to distinct phases, the global
maximum deﬁning the equilibrium phase. Keeping this in mind, we identify the ther modynamic phases
for a shell described by the Gratton EoS (10). The thermodynamic state space is deﬁned by M, but
also by the dimensionless parameters γandν:=σ2
cG3c−11/planckover2pi1, which are (in general) functions of the
activities.
The phase diagram is given in Fig. (7). For small M, the equilibrium phase is always of F type,
in agreement with our intuitions from Newtonian gravity. The B phase vanishes for ν→ ∞, and it
becomes increasingly dominant as ν→0. ForM > M OV, there are only S-type solutions: as long as
the free energy remains positive, the equilibrium phase is SI, for larg er values of Mit is SII. Note that
there is no coexistence curve between the B and the S phase: since the B phase corresponds to M0>0
and the S phase to M0<0, we always encounter an F phase at M0= 0 when going from B to S. For
largeν, the interpolating F phase is so small that it cannot be distinguished.
In Fig. 8, we plot the temperature at inﬁnity T∞and the free entropy Ω eqfor the equilibrium
solutions as a function of the ADM mass M. The free-entropy is, by construction, a continuous function
ofM,withdiscontinuousderivativesatthetransitions. Thetemper atureatinﬁnitymaybediscontinuous
at the transition points, the discontinuity ∆ T∞deﬁning the latent heat of the transition ℓ= Ωeq∆T∞.
Fig. 8 demonstrates that ℓ/negationslash= 0 at the B-F and the SI-SII boundaries, suggesting that the cor responding
transitionsareﬁrst-order; andthat ℓ= 0attheF-SIboundary, suggestingacontinuousphasetransitio n.
The discontinuity of the temperature at inﬁnity in Fig. 8 owes to the f act that transitions F→B,
B→FandSI→SIIare ﬁrst-order. In these transitions, Ω( M,P) has two local maxima for constant
M, oneofwhichisaglobalmaximum. Thespeciﬁcationoftheglobalmaxim umchangesatthetransition
point. This behavior is depicted in Fig.5 for SI→SIItransitions.
We also note that T∞is a decreasing function of mass M, hence, the associated heat capacity
C=dM
dT∞is negative. This has no impact on thermodynamic stability. First, we n ote that the heat
capacity associated to stability is deﬁned as a derivative at constan t particle numbers, while Cdeﬁned
here is deﬁned at constant activities. Second, thermodynamic sta bility is guaranteed by the concavity
of the equilibrium free entropy Ω eq, which follows from the use of the MEP in the latter’s construction.

4.2 Dynamical stability
Toanalyzedynamicalstability, weevaluatethefunctionΨofEq. (9) forsolutionsthatmaximizeentropy
maxima. We can prove that for any EoS, the equilibrium solutions of ty pe B lie on the curve Ψ = 0.
The proof is provided in the Appendix C. A solution with Ψ = 0 is dynamically unstable, because
small perturbations around equilibrium are guided by a quadratic ter m and they are unbounded in
one direction. Hence, there are no B-type solutions that are both dynamically and thermodynamically
stable. In contrast, F-type equilibrium solutions are also dynamically stable, with Ψ >0.
As mentioned earlier, S-type solutions maximize the total free ener gy only for M > M OV. Solutions
of type SII are always unstable, because Ψ <0 asκ0→ ∞. We have not been able to provide a proof
valid for a general EoS for the sign of Ψ in solutions of type SI. Howev er, we have found Ψ <0 for all
S-type solutions that maximize entropy with the Gratton EoS. A rep resentative plot is given in Fig. 9.
We conjecture that the S-phase is generically dynamically unstable, even though we cannot preclude
the existence of small regions of stability for the SI phase, especia lly nearM=MOV.
If this conjecture is true, then only F-type solutions can be bothdynamically and thermodynamically
stable. Again this is another result, where the behavior of thin-she ll solutions diﬀers from the behavior
of self-gravitating solutions with bulk matter.

F-type solutions are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable.
5 Conclusions
In this article, we gave a general analysis of the thermodynamics of spherically symmetric thin-shell
solutions to Einstein’s equations. We included solutions with negative in terior mass, which have not
been analyzed in the literature. We showed that the inclusion of such solutions is essential for the
thermodynamic consistency of the system. We can only implement th e Maximum Energy Principle
when we include an entropy term from the singularity that correspo nds to these solutions, in addition
to the Bekenstein-Hawking term for the entropy of solutions with p ositive interior mass. Then, we can
formulate a consistent thermodynamic description for this system , and identify, four distinct thermody-
namic phases. Our results are fully consistent with analogous result s obtained for bulk thermodynamic
systems. In particular, they provide an additional argument in sup port of the assignment of entropy
to the singularity of negative-mass Schwarzschild spacetime, and, consequently, to Penrose’s conjecture
about the assignment of entropy to singularities.
Thin shell solutions provide paradigmaticsystems by which to explore the properties ofgravitational
equilibrium thermodynamics. As shown in this paper, most thermodyn amic properties of such systems
can be demonstrated analytically. The next step will be to employ non -static thin shell models in order
to analyze non-equilibrium thermodynamic processes, in particular, the manifestation of a generalized
second law of thermodynamics in relation to black hole and naked singu larity solutions analyzed here.

A Uniqueness of solutions to Eq. (7)
We prove that Eq. (7) admits a unique solution κ∈(0,1) for any A,B >0.
By deﬁnition, Φ′(κ) = 4Aκ3−2(1 +A)κ−B. If Φ′(1)≤0, then 4 A≤2(1 +A) +B. Hence,
4Aκ3≤2(1+A)κ3+Bκ3<2(1+A)κ+B, for allκ∈(0,1). It follows that Φ′<0 in (0,1), and Φ
possesses at most one root for κ∈(0,1).
If Φ′(1)>0, then Φ′(0)Φ′(1)<0 since Φ′(0) =−B <0. There exists κ∗∈(0,1) such that
Φ′(κ∗) = 0, and Φ′(κ)>0 for all κ∈(κ∗,1), so that Φ possesses no rootin [κ∗,1). By deﬁnition
164Aκ3
∗= 2(1+A)κ∗+B, hence, 4 Aκ3= 2(1+A)κκ2
κ2
∗+Bκ3
κ3
∗<2(1+A)κ+B, for allκ∈(0,κ∗). Thus
Φ′<0 for any in (0 ,κ∗). Hence Φ( κ) possesses at most one root in (0 ,κ∗), and consequently, in (0 ,1).
Since Φ(0) = 1 >0 and Φ(1) = −B <0, Φ possesses at least one root in (0 ,1). We conclude that Φ
possesses a single root in (0,1).
B Asymptotic behaviour in the σ,P→0withP/σ→0limit
Eq (7) can be cast as
Aε4−4Aε3+(5A−1)ε2+(2−2A+B)ε−B= 0, (36)
whereε:= 1−κ >0. Ifσ,P→0 withP/σ→0 then Eq (36) cannot hold unless ε≪1, whence it
becomes
(5A−1)ε2+(2−2A+B)ε−B= 0. (37)
Sinceε >0 the latter implies
8ε= 2(A−1)−B+/radicalbig
16B+B2+16B(A−1)+4(A−1)2 (38)
SinceB≪1 the−Bterm on the r.h.s. of Eq (38) is negligible with respect to the square ro ot which
falls at most with√
B. Hence Eq (38) becomes
8ε= 2(A−1)+/radicalbig
16B+B2+16B(A−1)+4(A−1)2. (39)
Since|1−A|,B≪1 termsB2and 16B(A−1) are negligible with respect to 16 Band Eq (39) becomes
8ε= 2(A−1)+/radicalbig
16B+4(A−1)2 (40)
SinceA:= 1+4P/σandB:= 8πMσ(1+4P/σ) Eq (40) becomes
