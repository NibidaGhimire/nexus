A CENSUS OF THE TW HYA ASSOCIATION WITH GAIA1
K. L. Luhman2,3
Draft version May 8, 2023
ABSTRACT
Ihaveused high-precisionphotometryandastrometryfromthe t hird datareleaseofGaiatoperform
a survey for members of the TW Hya association (TWA). I have ident iﬁed candidate members that
appear to share similar kinematics and ages with bona ﬁde members co mpiled by Gagn´ e et al. (2017)
and I have assessed their membership using radial velocities and spe ctroscopic diagnostics of age
from various sources. My new catalog of adopted members contain s 67 Gaia sources in 55 systems.
The histogram of spectral types for TWA peaks near M5 ( ∼0.15M⊙), resembling the distributions
measured for other nearby young associations. The UVWvelocities of its members indicate that the
association is expanding. The rate of expansion corresponds to an age of 9.6+0.9
−0.8Myr. In a Gaia color-
magnitudediagram, themembersofTWAexhibit well-deﬁnedsequenc esofsinglestarsandunresolved
binary stars. The combined sequence of low-mass stars in TWA is indic ative of an age of 11 .4+1.3
−1.2Myr
when compared to the sequence for Upper Centaurus-Lupus/Lo wer Centaurus-Crux, for which an
age of 20 Myr is assumed. Based on these expansion and isochronal ages, I have adopted an age of
10±2Myr for TWA. Finally, I haveused mid-infrared photometry from th e Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey
Explorer to check for excess emission from circumstellar disks amon g the TWA members. Fourteen
members have detected disks, all of which have been reported in pr evious studies. The fraction of
members at ≤M6 (/greaterorsimilar0.1M⊙) that have full, transitional, or evolved disks is 10/52=0 .19+0.08
−0.06. That
value is similar to the fraction previously measured for the Upper Sco association, which is roughly
coeval with TWA.
1.INTRODUCTION
Because of its proximity and youth ( ∼40–100 pc,
10 Myr), the TW Hya association (TWA) is one
of the most important stellar populations in the
solar neighborhood. TW Hya was identiﬁed as a
possible young star based on H αemission (Henize
1976) and it was conﬁrmed as such through the de-
tection of Li absorption at 6708 ˚A and additional
emission lines (Herbig 1978; Rucinski & Krautter
1983). Candidates for young stars associated with
TW Hya have been selected via their positions near
sources detected by the Infrared Astronomical Satel-
lite (de la Reza et al. 1989; Gregorio-Hetem et al.
1992; Zuckerman & Becklin 1993), X-ray emission
(Kastner et al. 1997; Jensen et al. 1998; Sterzik et al.
1999; Webb et al. 1999; Zuckerman et al. 2001;
Song et al. 2003; Looper et al. 2010a), UV emission
(Rodriguez et al. 2011; Shkolnik et al. 2011; Binks et al.
2020), and optical and infrared (IR) colors (Gizis
2002; Scholz et al. 2005; Looper et al. 2007, 2010b;
Schneider et al. 2012b, 2016; Gagn´ e et al. 2014, 2017;
Kellogg et al. 2015), often in conjunction with proper
motions measured from wide-ﬁeld imaging surveys.
For some of those candidates, membership in TWA
has been further constrained using measurements of
radial velocities (e.g., Reid 2003; Torres et al. 2003;

Gizis et al. 2007; Ducourant et al. 2008; Teixeira et al.
2008; Ducourant et al. 2014; Weinberger et al. 2013;
Donaldson et al. 2016; Best et al. 2020), and the moving
cluster distance (Mamajek 2005). In one of the more
recent membership studies of TWA, Gagn´ e et al. (2017)
classiﬁed 24 and 11 systems as bona ﬁde members and
high-likelihood candidates, respectively.
The identiﬁcation of members of nearby asso-
ciations has been greatly facilitated by the Gaia
mission (Perryman et al. 2001; de Bruijne 2012;
Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016), which is measur-
ing high-precision photometry, proper motions, and
parallaxes for more than a billion stars down to
G∼20, corresponding to masses of ∼0.01–0.015 M⊙
in TWA (Baraﬀe et al. 2015; Chabrier et al. 2023).
Gagn´ e & Faherty (2018) used the second data release
of Gaia (DR2) to identify candidate members of 27
nearby associations, including nine candidates for TWA,
most of which have lacked the spectroscopy needed for
conﬁrmation of membership.
Inthispaper, IusethethirddatareleaseofGaia(DR3,
Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021, 2022) to identify candi-
date members of TWA and I assess their membership
with spectra and radial velocity measurements from var-
ious sources. I then use my catalog of adopted members
to study the association in terms of its initial mass func-
tion (IMF), kinematic and isochronal ages, and circum-
stellar disks.
2.SEARCH FOR NEW MEMBERS OF TWA
2.1.Identiﬁcation of Candidate Members2 Luhman
For my survey of TWA, I have used the following data
from Gaia DR3: photometry in bands at 3300–10500 ˚A
(G), 3300–6800 ˚A (GBP), and 6300-10500 ˚A (GRP);
proper motions and parallaxes ( G/lessorsimilar20); and radial ve-
locities ( G/lessorsimilar15). For parallactic distances, I adopt the
geometric values estimated by Bailer-Jones et al. (2021)
from the DR3 parallaxes. In addition, I have made use
of photometry in three near-IR bands ( JHKs) from the
Point Source Catalog of the Two Micron All Sky Sur-
vey (2MASS, Skrutskie et al. 2003, 2006) and photome-
try in four mid-IR bands from the AllWISE Source Cat-
alog of the Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE,
Wright et al. 2010, 2013; Cutri et al. 2013). The WISE
bands are centered at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 µm, which
are denoted as W1, W2, W3, and W4, respectively. For
members of TWA, 2MASS is slightly deeper than Gaia,
and WISE is deeper than both 2MASS and Gaia.
As done in my previous surveys of young associations
(e.g., Esplin & Luhman 2017; Luhman & Esplin 2020;
Luhman 2022a), I have analyzed the Gaia astrometry
in terms of a “proper motion oﬀset” (∆ µα,δ), which is
deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the observed proper
motion of a star and the motion expected at the celes-
tial coordinates and parallactic distance of the star for
a speciﬁed space velocity. The use of this metric min-
imizes projection eﬀects, which is important for asso-
ciations like TWA that cover a large area of sky. For
my survey of TWA, the proper motion oﬀsets are calcu-
lated relative to the motions expected for a velocity of
U,V,W=−12,−18,−6km s−1, which approximatesthe
median velocity of TWA members (Gagn´ e et al. 2017,
Section 2.3).
To perform a census of TWA, I began by consider-
ing the most probable members from previous work. In
a detailed study of TWA, Gagn´ e et al. (2017) compiled
a sample of 30 objects in 24 systems that they classi-
ﬁed as bona ﬁde members of TWA. While presenting
an update to their algorithm for identifying members of
young associations, Gagn´ e et al. (2018) also included a
list of bona ﬁde TWA members, which was the same as
in Gagn´ e et al. (2017) except for the exclusion of TWA 9
by the newer study. I ﬁnd that the data for TWA 9 are
consistent with those of the other bona ﬁde members, so
I have used the sample from Gagn´ e et al. (2017) to guide
my survey.
In the top row of Figure 1, I have plotted the bona
ﬁde TWAmembersfromGagn´ e et al. (2017) in diagrams
of ∆µαversus right ascension and ∆ µδversus declina-
tion. A correlation is present in each diagram, which
is suggestive of expansion. The expansion of TWA is
better characterized through analysis of UVWvelocities
in Sections 2.3 and 3.2. The outliers among the bona
ﬁde members in Figure 1 are components of binary sys-
tems. Among those outliers, the components of a given
binary tend to straddle the bulk of the bona ﬁde mem-
bers (i.e., the average proper motion oﬀsets of a binary’s
components are consistent with the overall population).
In the top row of Figure 2, I show the bona ﬁde TWA
members in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) consist-
ing ofMGRPversusGBP−GRPandG−GRP. I have
excluded photometry with errors greater than 0.1 mag.
The errors for TWA 30A exceed that threshold in GBP
andGRP, so it does not appear in either CMD. Forcomparison, I have included in each CMD a ﬁt to the
single-star sequence of the Pleiades cluster ( ∼120 Myr,
Stauﬀer et al. 1998; Dahm 2015) from Luhman (2023).
TW Hya (TWA 1) is slightly fainter than the sequence
formed by other members in the GBP−GRPCMD while
TWA30Bis well belowthe sequencein both CMDs. The
former is likely caused by UV excess emission related
to accretion (Rucinski & Krautter 1983; Muzerolle et al.
2000) and the latter may be evidence of an edge-on disk
(Looper et al. 2010b).
To identify candidate members of TWA, I selected
sources from Gaia DR3 that (1) are located within
a spatial volume extending well beyond the bona ﬁde
members but that do not overlap with candidate mem-
bers of Upper Centaurus-Lupus/Lower Centaurus-Crux
(UCL/LCC) from Luhman (2022a) (see Section 2.3), (2)
have proper motion oﬀsets that are similar to those of
the bona ﬁde members or that are consistent with their
pattern of expansion when extended in equatorial coor-
dinates, and (3) appear near or above the lower envelope
of the sequence of bona ﬁde members in at least one
CMD and do not appear below the sequence in either
CMD. Since stars with disks can appear underluminous
inCMDs, asmentionedearlierforTWA1andTWA30B,
I also considered Gaia sources that satisﬁed the ﬁrst two
criteria, appeared below the sequence in a CMD, and ex-
hibited mid-IR excess emission in data from WISE. For
the resulting candidates, I searched data archives and
previous studies for spectroscopic measurements of age
diagnostics (e.g., Li) and radial velocities. When spec-
troscopy was unavailable, I pursued new observations to
measure spectral types and age diagnostics (Section 2.2).
I rejected candidates if spectroscopy indicated ages older
than those of the bona ﬁde members or if radial veloc-
ity measurements and Gaia astrometry produced UVW
velocities that are inconsistent with membership (Sec-
tion 2.3). In the end, I arrived at a catalog of 67 adopted
TWA members that have entries in Gaia DR3, which
consist of 35 Gaia sources in 24 systems that correspond
to the bona ﬁde members from Gagn´ e et al. (2017) and
32 additional Gaia sources in 31 systems. One of these
sources, TWA 32B, has an entry in Gaia DR3 but lacks
a parallax measurement. The companions TWA 2B and
TWA 27B are absent from my catalog since they lack
Gaia detections. Gaia usually detects both components
of a pair like TWA 2A and 2B, which has a separation of
0.′′56 and ∆ K= 0.8 (Webb et al. 1999). TWA 27B has a
widerseparationof0 .′′78fromitsprimary(Chauvin et al.
2004), which is a brown dwarf (Gizis 2002), but a detec-
tionbyGaiaisnotexpectedgivenitsverylowluminosity.
To show the proper motion oﬀsets and CMDs for
my full catalog of adopted members, I have included
them in the bottom rows of Figures 1 and 2. In the
GBP−GRPCMD, the TWA members exhibit a narrow,
well-deﬁned lower sequence that likely consists of single
stars. An elevated sequence is evident as well, which
likely corresponds to unresolved binaries. To my knowl-
edge, (1) these CMDs are the ﬁrst to resolve the single-
and double-star sequences in TWA and (2) TWA is one
of the youngest populations in which that has been done.
The sequences of young stellar populations in CMDs and
other versions of Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagrams
are broadest in star-forming regions and become more
narrow at older ages, likely because of decreasing vari-Census of the TW Hya Association 3
ability from spots and accretion, the removal of most
extinction as the natal cloud disperses, and the fact that
a given age spread corresponds to a smaller range of lu-
minosities at older ages. As a result, detecting separate
sequences for single and binary stars is more easily done
with older populations. Doing so is also facilitated by
accurate photometry, precise relative distances for the
members of a population, and low contamination from
nonmembers. Relative to most other clusters and asso-
ciations, TWA has more accurate photometry and dis-
tances because of its proximity and less (negligible) vari-
able extinction because of its location within the Local
Bubble. In comparison, the single- and double-star se-
quences for Upper Sco and UCL/LCC (10 and 20 Myr)
are less distinct than those in TWA (Luhman 2022a),
likely because of variable extinction. In addition, since
they are much richer and have more complex structure,
Upper Sco and UCL/LCC may not have the same degree
of coevality as a small group like TWA.
Unlike the GBP−GRPCMD, the CMD for G−GRP
contains a large group of stars that are signiﬁcantly red-
der than the TWA sequences for single stars or binaries.
Nearly all of those stars appear in the elevated sequence
of unresolved binaries in the GBP−GRPCMD, which is
whythebinarysequenceislesspopulatedin G−GRP.G-
band ﬂuxes can be underestimated for extended sources
(Riello et al. 2021), which would explain the anomalous
colors of those TWA members if they are marginally re-
solved binaries.
When they were discovered, the young L
dwarfs WISEA J114724.10 −204021.3 and 2MASS
J11193254 −1137466 were classiﬁed as likely members of
TWA (Kellogg et al. 2015, 2016; Schneider et al. 2016),
but more recent astrometry appears to be inconsistent
with membership (Best et al. 2020). Both objects are
too faint for detections by Gaia, so I have calculated
their proper motion oﬀsets using the most accurate
proper motions that are available (Best et al. 2018), a
parallactic distance for WISEA J114724.10 −204021.3
(Best et al. 2020), and a photometric distance for
2MASS J11193254 −1137466 (Kellogg et al. 2015;
Best et al. 2017). The resulting oﬀsets are (∆ µα,
∆µδ)=(−9±12,−32±5)and (−7+31
−52,−39+14
−24) mas yr−1
for WISEA J114724.10 −204021.3 and 2MASS
J11193254 −1137466, respectively, which diﬀer sig-
niﬁcantly from the measurements for bona ﬁde TWA
members (Figure 1), supporting the results of Best et al.
(2020).
2.2.Spectroscopy of Candidates
For candidate members of TWA that lack spectral
classiﬁcations from previous studies, I have searched for
spectra in the data archives of various observatories. I
found optical spectra of ﬁve candidates that were ob-
tained with the Fibre-fed Optical Echelle Spectrograph
(FEROS; Kaufer et al. 1999) on the MPG/ESO 2.2 m
telescope through program 090.C-0200(A), the Gemini
Multi-ObjectSpectrograph(GMOS;Hook et al.2004)at
the Gemini South telescope through programGS-2014A-
Q-44, and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectro-
graph (UVES; Dekker et al. 2000) on the Unit Telescope
2 of the Very Large Telescope through program 092.C-
0203(A). David Rodriguez was the principal investiga-tor for each of the three programs. For eight remain-
ing candidates that lacked archival spectra, I obtained
data with GMOS at the Gemini South telescope. All
of the spectra in question cover a wide range of wave-
lengths, spanning from 6000–9000 ˚A at a minimum. The
data from GMOS, UVES, and FEROS exhibit R∼4400,
20,000, and 48,000, respectively. An example of one of
the GMOS spectra is shown in Figure 3. All of the re-
duced spectra from GMOS are available in an electronic
ﬁle associated with that ﬁgure. Pipeline-reduced spectra
for UVES and FEROS can be retrieved from the data
archive of the European Southern Observatory.
The 13 candidates with spectra are listed in Table 1.
I have assessed the ages of the targets using Li absorp-
tion at 6707 ˚A and the Na doublet near 8190 ˚A, which
is sensitive to surface gravity. In all of the spectra, the
Na doublet is weak enough to be consistent with a pre-
main-sequence star ( /lessorsimilar50 Myr). Ten of the stars have
suﬃciently strong Li absorption (Table 1) to be near the
age of TWA or younger (e.g., Mentuch et al. 2008). Two
stars, which are components of a 2′′pair, have upper
limits on the strength of Li that are inconsistent with
membership ( <0.1˚A), so they are treated as nonmem-
bers. The ﬁnal candidate, which is the coolest one (M6),
lacks a useful constraint on Li. For that star, I take the
Na doublet as suﬃcient evidence ofyouth for inclusion in
the catalog of members. I have measured spectral types
for the candidates through comparison to ﬁeld dwarf
standards for <M5 (Henry et al. 1994; Kirkpatrick et al.
1991,1997)andaveragesofdwarfandgiantstandardsfor
≥M5(Luhman et al.1997; Luhman 1999). The resulting
classiﬁcations range from M3.5–M6 and are included in
Table 1.
2.3.UVWVelocities
The membership of the TWA candidates selected from
Gaia DR3 in Section 2.1 can be further constrained
viaUVWvelocities if they have measurements of ra-
dial velocities. I have compiled previous measure-
ments of radial velocities for the bona ﬁde members
of TWA from Gagn´ e et al. (2017) and the additional
candidate members. For most stars that have multi-
ple radial velocity measurements, I have adopted the
velocity with the smallest error. In the case of Gaia
DR3 3567379121431731328, the measurements span a
range of ∼20 km s−1, which is much larger than
the individual errors (1–3 km s−1, Gagn´ e et al. 2017;
Riedel et al. 2017, Gaia DR2 and DR3) and is sugges-
tive of a spectroscopic binary. For the purpose of cal-
culating the UVWvelocity, I have adopted the radial
velocity from Gaia DR3, which is near the middle of
the velocity range. For TWA 4A, I have used a mea-
surement of the radial velocity for the TWA 4A+B sys-
tem (Z´ u˜ niga-Fern´ andez et al. 2021b). TWA 23 is a spec-
troscopic binary that exhibits signiﬁcant variation in
its radial velocity measurements (Shkolnik et al. 2011;
Bailey et al. 2012). Z´ u˜ niga-Fern´ andez et al. (2021a) cal-
culated the median and standard deviation of its avail-
able velocities, which I have adopted. Gaia DR3 pro-
vides separate velocities for the components of the 0 .′′58
pair TWA 16 while a much more precise measure-
ment is available for the composite of the system from
Z´ u˜ niga-Fern´ andez et al. (2021a). The latter measure-4 Luhman
ment has been adopted for the primary. Similarly, I have
assigned the unresolved radial velocity measurement for
the 0.′′66 pair TWA 32 to its primary. The secondary in
that system is the only bona ﬁde member that lacks a
radial velocity in my catalog.
I have used the radial velocities in conjunction with
proper motions from Gaia DR3 and parallactic distances
based on DR3 parallaxes (Bailer-Jones et al. 2021) to
calculate UVWvelocities (Johnson & Soderblom 1987).
The velocity errors were estimated in the manner de-
scribed by Luhman & Esplin (2020) using the python
packagepyia(Price-Whelan 2021).
To illustrate their spatial distribution, I have plotted
the bona ﬁde TWA members from Gagn´ e et al. (2017)
in diagrams of XYZGalactic Cartesian positions in the
top row of Figure 4. In the diagram of YversusX, I
have included a boundary that approximates the edge of
the UCL/LCC members identiﬁed by Luhman (2022a).
TWA and UCL/LCC overlap in Z, so similar boundaries
are not shown in the other two diagrams of spatial po-
sitions. As mentioned in Section 2.1, I have excluded
the volume encompassing UCL/LCC from my survey for
TWA members.
In the bottom row of Figure 4, the measurements of
U,V, andWfor the bona ﬁde TWA members are plot-
ted versus X,Y, andZ, respectively. Most of the stars
are well-clustered in those diagrams. The outliers are
components of binary systems and their binarity likely
accounts for the discrepant velocities. The velocity com-
ponents of the bona ﬁde members are correlated with
their corresponding spatial dimensions, which indicates
the presence of expansion, as found with the proper mo-
tion oﬀsets in Figure 1 (Section 2.1). In my survey for
new members, I have excluded stars that have UVWve-
locities that do not follow the pattern of expansion of the
bona ﬁde members, as discussed in Section 2.1.
In Figure 5, I present diagrams of XYZandUVW
for the bona ﬁde members and the additional stars that
I have adopted as members. The latter span a larger
spatial volume than the former. The range of distances
among the adopted members is 34–105 pc. All else
being equal, spatial outliers are more likely than cen-
trally concentrated candidates to be contaminants, so
I have ﬂagged the outliers in the catalog presented in
Table 2. Ten of the adopted members are absent from
the diagrams of UVWsince they lack radial velocity
data. One of them, TWA 32B, is a secondary in a
system that has a measured radial velocity. Measure-
ments of the radial velocities for the remaining nine
stars would help to better constrain their membership.
In addition, the available radial velocities for two of
the coolest members, 2MASS J12474428 −3816464 and
TWA 40, have large uncertainties (6 and 7 km s−1), so
their membership constraints would beneﬁt from more
accurate measurements. For the 57 adopted members
that have measured UVWvelocities, the median veloc-
ity isU,V,W=−12.2,−18.4,−6.1 km s−1.
The 67 Gaia sources that are adopted as TWA mem-
bers in this workare presented in Table 2, which includes
sourcenamesfrom Gaia DR3 and previousstudies; equa-
torialcoordinates,propermotion, parallax, renormalized
unitweighterror(RUWE,Lindegren2018), andphotom-
etry from Gaia DR3; measurements ofspectral types and
the type adopted in this work; distance estimate basedon the Gaia DR3 parallax (Bailer-Jones et al. 2021); the
adopted radial velocity measurement; the UVWveloci-
ties calculated in this section; the designations and an-
gular separations of the closest sources within 3′′from
2MASS and WISE; ﬂags indicating whether the Gaia
source is the closest match in DR3 for the 2MASS and
WISEsources; photometryfrom2MASSandWISE(only
for the Gaia source that is closest to the 2MASS/WISE
source); ﬂags indicating whether excesses are detected
in three WISE bands and a disk classiﬁcation if excess
emission is detected (Section 3.4); a ﬂag for the bona ﬁde
members from Gagn´ e et al. (2017); and a ﬂag for spatial
outliers (Figure 5). TWA 16, TWA 32, and TWA 39
are binaries with separations of /lessorsimilar1′′in which the com-
ponents have similar apparent magnitudes from Gaia.
For each system, the spectral classiﬁcation is based on
seeing-limited data and likely applies to a composite of
both components. I have assigned those spectral types
to the primaries in Table 2.
2.4.Comparison to Previous Studies
I discuss two stars that are among my adopted TWA
members but that have been rejected in some previous
studies: Gaia DR3 3567379121431731328 and TWA 31.
The former was rejected by Gagn´ e et al. (2017), likely
because of their measurement of its radial velocity
(−0.1±0.8 km s−1). When I adopt the value of
12.29±4.15 km s−1from Gaia DR3, which is closer
to the middle of the available measurements, the result-
ingUVWvelocity is roughly consistent with member-
ship (Figure 5). The star appears above the single-star
sequence for TWA in the CMDs in Figure 2, which is
consistent with the fact that it may be an unresolved bi-
nary based on its large spread in measured velocities and
its spectrum (Gagn´ e et al. 2017). I have included it in
my catalog of adopted members, but a measurement of
its system velocity would be useful for better assessing
membership. The second star, TWA 31, was identiﬁed
as a possible member of TWA by Shkolnik et al. (2011)
but was classiﬁed as a likely contaminant from LCC by
Gagn´ e et al. (2017). More recently, Venuti et al. (2019)
found that the UVWvelocity of the star based on Gaia
DR2 data was consistent with membership in TWA. I
arrive at the same conclusion with the data from Gaia
DR3. With a position near X,Y,Z= 27,−66,40 pc,
TWA 31 is not a spatial outlier compared to other TWA
members and it does not overlap with UCL/LCC (Fig-
ure 5). The strength of its Li absorption indicates an age
of<20 Myr (Shkolnik et al. 2011), which is consistent
with TWA membership. The presence of a circumstel-
lar disk with a high accretion rate serves as additional
evidence of youth (Shkolnik et al. 2011; Schneider et al.
2012a; Venuti et al. 2019). It is much fainter than other
TWA members near its spectral type in the Gaia CMDs
(Figure 2), which suggests that it is seen primarily in
scatteredlightatopticalwavelengths(e.g., edge-ondisk).
Gagn´ e et al. (2017) presented three categories of pos-
sible members of TWA. My catalog includes all of
their bona ﬁde members (35 Gaia sources in 24 sys-
tems), nine of their 12 high-likelihood candidate mem-
bers (TWA 3A and B are counted separately), and
ﬁve of their 44 candidate members. In addition, it
contains four stars rejected for membership in TWA
by that study (e.g., the aforementioned TWA 31Census of the TW Hya Association 5
and Gaia DR3 3567379121431731328) and ﬁve of the
nine TWA candidates identiﬁed with Gaia DR2 by
Gagn´ e & Faherty (2018). One remaining star, Gaia DR3
5412403269717562240,was classiﬁed as a member of the
βPic moving group by Schneider et al. (2019). It is
a modest outlier in Zrelative to other TWA members
(Z= 5 pc), but its UVWvelocity is consistent with
membership when accounting for the pattern of expan-
sion. It is also an outlier in YandZrelative to members
ofβPic (Shkolnik et al. 2017).
3.PROPERTIES OF THE TWA STELLAR POPULATION
3.1.Initial Mass Function
Previous catalogs of proposed members of TWA have
been used to estimate the association’s IMF (Looper
2011; Gagn´ e et al. 2017). The same can be done with
my new catalog of adopted members. As in my pre-
vious surveys of star-forming regions and young asso-
ciations, I have used spectral type as an observational
proxy for stellar mass when characterizing the IMF of
TWA. In Figure 6, I have plotted a histogram of spec-
tral types for the TWA members. The source cata-
log from Gaia DR3 has a high level of completeness
atG/lessorsimilar19–20 for most of the sky (Boubert & Everall
2020; Fabricius et al. 2021). At the far side of the as-
sociation ( ∼100 pc), G= 19 corresponds to a spectral
type of∼M8 among members of TWA, so the histogram
in Figure 6 should be unbiased for types earlier than
that value. Two likely members that lack Gaia detec-
tions are absent from my catalog and thus do not appear
in Figure 6 (Section 2.1), consisting of TWA 2B (M2–
M3.5, Webb et al. 1999; Herczeg & Hillenbrand 2014)
and TWA 27B (mid-to-late L, Chauvin et al. 2004;
Mohanty et al. 2007; Patience et al. 2010; Allers & Liu
2013). The histogramofspectral types for TWA exhibits
a maximum near M5 ( ∼0.15M⊙), which resembles the
distributions measured for other nearby young associa-
tions (e.g., Luhman 2022a).
3.2.Kinematic Ages
Two forms of kinematic ages can be explored for
young unbound associations, consisting of the expan-
sion age and the traceback age (e.g., Blaauw 1964;
Brown et al.1997;Mamajek & Bell2014;Crundall et al.
2019; Zari et al. 2019; Miret-Roig et al. 2020; Luhman
2022c; Couture et al. 2023; Galli et al. 2023). Previous
studies have attempted to derive both ages for TWA
(Makarov et al. 2005; Mamajek 2005; de la Reza et al.
2006; Ducourant et al. 2014; Donaldson et al. 2016).
Kinematic age estimates in TWA should beneﬁt signiﬁ-
cantly from the expanded size and improvedmembership
classiﬁcations in the new TWA census, the high preci-
sion of the Gaia astrometry, and the availability of radial
velocity data for most of the members. For my analy-
sis of the kinematic ages, I have omitted the two mem-
bers that have the largest radial velocity uncertainties,
2MASS J12474428 −3816464 and TWA 40, and multiple
systems that have discrepant velocities relative to other
TWA embers, which consist of TWA 4A/B, TWA 5A/B,
and Gaia DR3 3567379121431731328 (Figure 5).
AsmentionedinSection2.3andillustratedinFigure5,
the space velocities for the TWA members exhibit corre-
lationswithspatialpositions,whichindicatethepresenceof expansion. The rate of expansion can be directly con-
vertedtoanageundertheassumptionthatthestarshave
traveled on linear trajectories. However, members of an
expanding association will eventually experience acceler-
ation due to the Galactic potential (Blaauw 1952). For
an association near an age of 10 Myr, the eﬀect on the
expansion rates in XandYshould be negligible, but the
rate inZcould diﬀer by up to 20–30% from the value for
linear expansion (Brown et al. 1997). I have estimated
the slopes of the correlations between UVWandXYZ
in Figure 5, which are the expansion rates, using robust
linear regression with bootstrap sampling, arriving at
0.103±0.012,0.099±0.021,and0 .101±0.018kms−1pc−1
inX,Y, andZ, respectively. In studies of young associ-
ations, the XYZexpansion rates often are inconsistent
with a single well-deﬁned value, but the rates for TWA
have fairly small errors and agree surprisingly well, in-
cluding the rate in Z. The weighted mean of the three
slopes is 0 .102±0.009 km s−1pc−1, which corresponds
to an expansion age of 9.6+0.9
−0.8Myr. As done for the
32 Ori association in Luhman (2022c), I have also at-
tempted to estimate a traceback age for TWA by identi-
fying the times in the past when the standard deviations
ofX,Y, andZwere each minimized. The implied ages
do not correspond to a single value and instead range
from∼3–8 Myr. It is possible that choosing a diﬀer-
ent metric for the size of the association would produce
a better deﬁned traceback age (Miret-Roig et al. 2020;
Couture et al. 2023; Galli et al. 2023).
3.3.Isochronal Age
The age of a young association can be estimated
from a comparison of its sequence of low-mass
stars in an H-R diagram to isochrones from the-
oretical evolutionary models (Baraﬀe et al. 2015;
Choi et al. 2016; Dotter 2016; Feiden 2016). Previ-
ous studies have applied that method to members
of TWA, typically producing ages of ∼8–10 Myr
(Stauﬀer et al. 1995; Soderblom et al. 1998; Webb et al.
1999; Barrado y Navascu´ es 2006; Weinberger et al.
2013; Bell et al. 2015; Herczeg & Hillenbrand 2015;
Donaldson et al. 2016). As with the kinematic ages,
it should be possible to improve the estimate of the
isochronal age of TWA with the new census.
To derive an isochronal age for TWA, I have fol-
lowedtheprocedureappliedtoassociationsneartheTau-
rus star-forming region in Luhman (2023). I have se-
lected TWA members that have precise parallaxes ( σπ<
0.1 mas) and photometry ( σBP<0.1,σRP<0.1) and
have colors indicative of low-mass stars ( GBP−GRP=
1.4–2.8). Disk-bearing stars are excluded to avoid con-
tamination of the photometry by disk-related emission.
Within that color range, all members satisfy the crite-
ria for photometric errors and only four of the diskless
stars are omitted because of parallax errors. All of the
latter are companions that have poor astrometric ﬁts ac-
cording to their large values of RUWE. The resulting
sample contains 17 sources. I have calculated their oﬀ-
sets inMGRPfrom a ﬁt to the median of the sequence
for UCL/LCC (Luhman 2023). I have assumed that the
starshave no extinction since they are located within the
Local Bubble. A histogram of the MGRPoﬀsets is shown
in Figure 7. I have calculated the median and the me-6 Luhman
dian absolute deviation (MAD) of the oﬀsets, arriving at
−0.36 and 0.07, respectively. If the criteria for parallax
error or disks are eliminated, the median oﬀset is nearly
unchanged, but the MAD increases because most of the
added stars are elevated above the single-star sequence
(i.e., likely unresolved binaries). This is a reﬂection of
the fact that the value of MAD is dominated by the in-
trinsic width of the TWA sequence produced by single
and binary stars rather than measurement errors.
I have converted the median oﬀset for the sample
of 17 stars to an age by assuming that UCL/LCC
(∆M=0) has an age of 20 Myr (Luhman 2022a) and that
∆logL/∆logage= −0.6, asdoneinLuhman (2023). The
age of 20 Myr for UCL/LCC is tied to the lithium de-
pletion boundary (LDB) age for the βPic moving group
(Binks & Jeﬀries 2016), as discussed in Luhman (2022a).
The resulting isochronal age for TWA is 11 .4+1.3
−1.2Myr.
Onceagain,thaterrorisdeterminedprimarilybythegap
between the single- and double-star sequences and the
relative numbers of singles and binaries in the sample.
In addition, the derived age may be subject to system-
atic errors arising from the adopted age for UCL/LCC
and the conversion from MGRPoﬀsets to relative ages.
As an alternative to the above approach, an age for
TWA can be estimated by directly ﬁtting its single-star
sequence of low-mass stars in MGRPversusGBP−GRP
with model ishochrones. For instance, the isochrones of
Baraﬀe et al. (2015) imply an age of ∼6 Myr while the
models of Dotter (2016) and Choi et al. (2016) imply an
age of∼4 Myr. Models that account for the inhibition
of convection by magnetic ﬁelds tend to produce older
ages that are in better agreement with ages derived from
the LDB and the mass-radiusrelationship for young low-
mass stars (Kraus et al. 2015; David et al. 2016, 2019;
Feiden 2016; MacDonald & Mullan 2017; Binks et al.
2022). However, in the Gaia CMD, new versions of the
magnetic isochrones from Feiden (2016) provided by G.
Feiden (private communication) are much less parallel
to the TWA single-star sequence than the non-magnetic
isochrones, implying ages of ∼25 and 11 Myr at GBP−
GRP= 1.6 and 3, respectively. Given these complica-
tions with the ﬁtting of both non-magnetic and magnetic
isochrones, I prefer the procedure followed earlier in this
section in which empirical isochrones are compared and
some are dated with the LDB (Herczeg & Hillenbrand
2015).
From this study, the most reliable age estimates for
TWA appear to be the expansion age of 9.6+0.9
−0.8Myr and
the isochronal age of ∼11.4 Myr. Based on these values,
I adopt an age of 10 ±2 Myr for TWA.
3.4.Circumstellar Disks
I have used mid-IR photometry from WISE to search
for evidence of disks among the adopted members of
TWA. The 67 objects in my catalog have 61 matching
sourcesfromWISE. IfaclosepairofGaiasourceshasthe
same WISE source as their closest match, the WISE des-
ignation appears in both of their entries in Table 2, but
the disk measurements from this section are listed only
for the candidate that is closestto the WISE source. The
AllWISE Atlas imagesofthe WISE sourceshavebeen vi-
sually inspected to check for detections that are false or
unreliable, which are marked by a ﬂag in Table 2.As done in my previous surveys of young associations
(e.g., Luhman 2022b), I have used W1 −W2, W1 −W3,
and W1−W4 to detect excess emission from disks among
the 61 WISE sources in TWA. Those colors are plotted
versus spectral type in Figure 8. I have omitted W2 data
at W2<6 since they are subject to signiﬁcant systematic
errors (Cutri et al. 2012). In each of the three colors,
some sources are found in a blue sequence that corre-
sponds to stellar photospheres while others have redder
colors that indicate the presence of IR excess emission
from circumstellar dust. In Figure 8, I have marked
the threshold for each color that was used by Luhman
(2022b) for identifying color excesses. Flags indicating
the presence or absence of excesses in W2, W3, and W4
are included in Table 2.
For two of the TWA members that lack detections in
W4, TWA 8B and TWA 26, measurements in a similar
band at 24 µm (denoted as [24]) with the Multiband
Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS; Rieke et al.
2004; Werner et al. 2004) have been reported in pre-
vious studies (Riaz et al. 2006b; Luhman et al. 2010;
Schneider et al. 2012a). I have adopted the MIPS data
as a proxy for W4 when calculating W1 −W4 and deter-
mining the excess ﬂag for W4. Because of the proximity
to its primary(8′′), HR 4796Bappearsto haveunreliable
photometry in W2, W3, and W4. As a result, it is the
only WISE source in my catalog that is not assessed for
excess emission in any of those bands.
The evolutionary stages of the detected disks have
been classiﬁed from among the following options: full
disk, transitional disk, evolved disk, evolved transi-
tional disk, and debris disk (Kenyon & Bromley 2005;
Rieke et al. 2005; Hern´ andez et al. 2007; Luhman et al.
2010; Espaillat et al. 2012). The classes are estimated
basedonthesizesoftheexcessesin Ks−W3andKs−W4
(Luhman & Mamajek 2012; Esplin et al. 2014, 2018).
The color excesses, E( Ks−W3) and E( Ks−W4), are cal-
culated by subtracting the expected photospheric color
for a given spectral type (Luhman 2022a). The result-
ing excesses are plotted in Figure 9 with the criteria
for the disk classes (Esplin et al. 2018). The values of
E(Ks−W2) are included as well to illustrate sizes of
the excesses in W2. Sources that lack excesses in any
of the WISE bands are excluded from Figure 9 and
are designated as class III (Lada & Wilking 1984; Lada
1987). The excesses for TWA 30B are large enough
to place it beyond the limits of Figure 9. Gaia DR3
6152893526035165312 has excesses in W2 and W3 but
is not detected in W4, so it is absent from those dia-
grams. The excesses in Figure 9 imply that HR 4796 has
a transitional disk and that TW Hya and HD 98800B
have full disks, but more detailed measurements of their
spectralenergydistributions indicate that HR 4796hasa
debrisdiskandthelattertwostarshavetransitionaldisks
(Jura 1991; Augereau et al. 1999; Calvet et al. 2002;
Uchida et al. 2004; Furlan et al. 2007), which are the
classes adopted in Table 2.
Fourteen of the WISE sources exhibit IR ex-
cess emission, all of which have had disks de-
tected in previous work (Rucinski & Krautter 1983;
de la Reza et al. 1989; Jura 1991; Gregorio-Hetem et al.
1992; Zuckerman & Becklin 1993; Mohanty et al. 2003;
Sterzik et al. 2004; Uchida et al. 2004; Low et al. 2005;
Riaz et al.2006b; Morrow et al. 2008; Rebull et al. 2008;Census of the TW Hya Association 7
Riaz & Gizis 2008; Herczeg et al. 2009; Looper et al.
2010a,b; Shkolnik et al. 2011; Schneider et al.
2012a,b; Rodriguez et al. 2015; Boucher et al. 2016;
Binks & Jeﬀries 2017). They consist of four full, seven
evolved, two transitional, and one debris disk. Previous
studies have reported a modest excess in [24] for TWA 7
based on Ks−[24] (Low et al. 2005; Rebull et al. 2008;
Schneider et al. 2012a; Binks & Jeﬀries 2017), but I do
not ﬁnd an excess in either [24] or W4 relative to W1.
The previous detections of an excess in [24] may have
been caused by variability between the observations in
Kand the mid-IR bands. Similarly, Rebull et al. (2008)
identiﬁed an excess in [24] for TWA 8B using Ks−[24],
whereas I ﬁnd that W1 −[24] is consistent with the
expected photospheric value.
Among WISE sources in TWA that have been assessed
for IR excesses and that have spectral types of ≤M6,
the fraction that have full, transitional, or evolved disks
is 10/52=0 .19+0.08
−0.06. That value is consistent with the
disk fraction for the same range of types in Upper Sco
(0.19±0.01, Luhman 2022b), which is roughly coeval
with TWA (Section 3.3, Luhman & Esplin 2020).
4.CONCLUSIONS
I have performed a survey for members of the TW Hya
association using high-precision photometry and astrom-
etry from Gaia DR3 and ground-based spectroscopy. I
have used the new catalog of adopted members to char-
acterize the IMF and the age of the association and to
identify and classify its circumstellar disks. The results
are summarized as follows:
1. Gagn´ e et al. (2017) compiled a sample of bona
ﬁde members of TWA, consisting of 24 systems
that are resolved into 35 sources in Gaia DR3. I
have used the kinematics and photometry of those
members to guide a search for additional members
with Gaia DR3. For the resulting candidates, I
have checked whether membership is supported by
UVWvelocities (when radial velocities are avail-
able) and spectroscopic diagnostics of age. All of
the candidates have the latter from previous stud-
ies or new spectra analyzed in this work. In the
end, my catalog of adopted members contains 67
Gaia sources in 55 systems. In addition to the
bona ﬁde members, the catalog includes nine high-
likelihood candidates (eight systems) and ﬁve can-
didates from Gagn´ e et al. (2017) and ﬁve candi-
dates from Gagn´ e & Faherty (2018). The remain-
ing 13 adopted members have not been previously
classiﬁed as candidates. Although all objects in
thecataloghavegoodevidenceofmembershipfrom
Gaia data and spectroscopy, measurements of ra-
dial velocities for the nine systems that lack such
data would be useful for further assessing their
membership.
2. The histogram of spectral types for the adopted
members of TWA peaks near M5 ( ∼0.15M⊙),
indicating that the characteristic mass of the IMF
in TWA is similar to the values in other nearby
associations and star-forming regions.
3. For the TWA members that have measured radial
velocities, U,V, andWare positively correlatedwithX,Y, andZ, respectively,indicatingthe pres-
ence of expansion. The slopes of the three cor-
relations are consistent with each other and their
weighted mean corresponds to an expansion age of
9.6+0.9
−0.8Myr.
4. In a CMD constructed from Gaia data, the mem-
bers of TWA exhibit well-deﬁned sequences of sin-
gle stars and unresolved binary stars. TWA is one
of the youngest populations (if not the youngest)
in which the two sequences have been resolved.
The combined sequence of low-mass stars is 0 .36±
0.07 mag brighter than the median sequence for
UCL/LCC. If one adopts an age of 20 Myr for the
latter and assumes that young low-mass stars fade
at a rate given by ∆log L/∆log age= −0.6, the oﬀ-
set forTWAfromUCL/LCCcorrespondstoanage
of 11.4+1.3
−1.2Myr. Based on that value and the ex-
pansion age, I adopt an age of 10 ±2 Myr for TWA.
5. Ihaveusedmid-IRphotometryfromWISEtoiden-
tify TWA members that exhibit IR excesses from
disks. The evolutionary stages of the detected
disks have been classiﬁed using the sizes of the ex-
cesses. Fourteen members have IR excesses, all of
which have had disks reported in previous studies.
Among WISE sources in TWA that have been as-
sessed for IR excesses and that have spectral types
of≤M6, the fraction that have full, transitional,
or evolved disks is 10/52=0 .19+0.08
−0.06. That value is
consistent with the disk fraction for the same range
of types in Upper Sco (0 .19±0.01,Luhman 2022b),
which is roughly coeval with TWA.
