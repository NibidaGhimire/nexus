Sleep is among the most important factors affecting one’s daily performance, well-being, and life quality. Nevertheless, it became
possible to measure it in daily life in an unobtrusive manner with wearable devices. Rather than camera recordings and extraction of
the state from the images, wrist-worn devices can measure directly via accelerometer, heart rate, and heart rate variability sensors.
Some measured features can be as follows: time to bed, time out of bed, bedtime duration, minutes to fall asleep, and minutes after
wake-up. There are several studies in the literature regarding sleep quality and stage prediction. However, they use only wearable data
to predict or focus on the sleep stage. In this study, we use the NetHealth dataset, which is collected from 698 college students’ via
wearables, as well as surveys. Recently, there has been an advancement in deep learning algorithms, and they generally perform better
than conventional machine learning techniques. Among them, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have high performances. Thus,
in this study, we apply different CNN architectures that have already performed well in the human activity recognition domain and
compare their results. We also apply Random Forest (RF) since it performs best among the conventional methods. In future studies, we
will compare them with other deep learning algorithms.

1 INTRODUCTION
Understanding the underlying factors of sleep quality may significantly improve people’s living standards. There
could be many factors that need to be discovered that affect sleep quality metrics. These factors can be exposed with
the help of big data and accurate deep-learning models. This study aims to find meaningful relations between sleep
measurements with comprehensive multi-modal data, including personal surveys and everyday wearable device data.
All the mentioned data are derived from the NetHealth open-source dataset1[11], which was collected from 698
students in total during eight semesters. This comprehensive study includes data on communication patterns from
mobile phones, sleep, and physical activity routines, students’ family backgrounds, living conditions, personality, etc.,
from surveys. This study uses some parts of the basic survey and all the wearable device data. Therefore, to extract the
required data, preprocessing is applied to construct a sub-dataset for the analysis.

In the original NetHealth dataset, several sub-components, such as communication, wearable, survey, courses and
grades, and calendar are included. Wearable measurements are performed for activity and sleep tracking using a
Fitbit device. We used wearable and survey datasets for this study to construct a sub-dataset to apply deep learning
and ensemble learning. However, this raw data form is incompatible with training deep learning algorithms. The
preprocessing step will be further discussed in the paper.
We applied several CNN architectures which perform well in the human activity recognition domain [ 19]. As our
measurements in the dataset are collected from wearables on a daily basis, we decided to focus on the architectures
utilized for daily activity recognition tasks. Details of these architectures and their differences are further discussed
in the paper. We also applied Random Forest (RF) as an ensemble learning method to compare the performance with
deep learning architectures. RF is also used to extract important features for sleep quality prediction. Even though
deep learning algorithms, especially CNNs, perform better compared to conventional machine learning techniques,
our results show that in this context, RF performs better. We believe that it is highly related to dataset characteristics
since in [2], authors also applied different deep learning techniques such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Long-Short
Term Memory Network (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Elastic Net (EN), and compared them with conventional
machine learning technique; RF. They found RF to be performing better than other methods.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains state of the art on sleep recognition studies from the
point of the wearable domain. Section 3 explains dataset details and the preprocessing steps for further analyses. In
Section 4, we present model results with different proposed architectures. Finally, Section 5 discusses our findings with
other future study ideas.
2 RELATED WORKS
Several related studies exist about the sleep quality prediction of people that use wearable devices and questionnaires as
measurement metrics. We can emphasize the studies [ 1,3,7,9,11–13] as the most related ones to our study. Although
the personal survey is not included in all the mentioned works, wearable devices are the key for all of them.
In [1], authors use three different sleep quality metrics: Daily Sleep Quality, Weekly Sleep Quality, and Sleep
Consistency. CNN and MLP methods are applied. CNN is found to be the outperforming method compared to MLP on
all these three quality metrics. There were three classes for daily and weekly sleep quality metrics indicating good
to poor quality; and four classes for sleep consistency metric which is obtained by the weighted sum of the standard
deviations of sleep, rest, bedtime, out-of-bedtime, and sleep inconsistency between weekdays and weekends. CNN
obtains the best results on weekly sleep quality classification with 97.30%accuracy.
In [3], the main aim was correctly predicting the future sleep duration, which will help identify future sleep quality.
As a model, they utilized a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to consider individual variability on sleep duration,
which provides better estimates, hence better sleep quality predictions, in addition to a generalized linear model (GLM)
for considering fixed effects.
In [7], sleep and activity metrics are used to estimate university students’ well-being. The same data set is used in
this study, NetHealth data. Daily sleep and activity data is used to train a classification algorithm. The study aims to
predict the “Subjective Well-being" score of people from average daily steps, average heart rate, heartbeat standard
deviation, average sleep duration, and sleep duration deviation gathered from wearable devices. They used Naive Bayes,
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Ensemble classifiers as methods to train.
In [9], data from 39 students using Fitbit devices is collected during 106 days. They focused on predicting two classes:
good quality and poor quality of sleep based on seven features, such as calories, steps, distance, sedentary, lightly active,

fairly active, very active. They applied Random Forest as a conventional machine learning method and LSTM, GRU, and
CNN as deep learning methods. Their obtained results indicate that CNN could improve sleep quality prediction from
activities. But the best performing model is reported as GRU.
In [11], authors discuss the compliance of Fitbit usage among college students and the reasons for non-compliance.
They observed patterns for general health, sleep, and exercise. Mainly, a contrastive pattern between weekdays and
weekends, regular school days, and deadline-intensive patterns are observed among the ones with a compliance rate
higher than 60%.
Study [ 12] has a wide range of target values while using personality traits, wearable device data, and mobile phone
data. They collected multi-modal data from 66 people for a month. This multi-modal data includes perceived stress, sleep,
personality, physiological, behavioral, and social interaction data to train a model to divine academic performance, sleep,
stress, and mental health scores. They used SVM-L and SVM-RBF models to train and compared the GPA (Academic
Preformance), PSQI (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), PSS (Perceived Stress Scale), and MCS (Mental Health Composite
Score) results for different training datasets. As sleep was not a target in the scope of this study, they examined only its
relation with other terms. It is found that poor sleep quality and high-stress levels are highly correlated. In addition, the
poor sleep quality group has been found to have more screen time around 3-6 am and less around 9 am-12 pm.
In [13], the aim is to classify sleep quality with a deep learning model trained with wearable device data. They used
the physical activity data collected during awake time. The target values of the prediction model are poor or good
sleep quality. The wearable measurements are done using an Actigraphy device which is accepted as a gold-standard
device for clinical studies of sleep and physical activity patterns. Data is collected from 92 adolescents over one whole
week. Their methods are traditional logistic regression as a conventional ML method and more advanced deep learning
methods: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), simple Elman-type recurrent neural
network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM-RNN), and a time-batched version of LSTM-RNN (TB-LSTM). At
the end of the study, they revealed that the CNN has the highest accuracy with 0.9449 while the traditional logistic
regression has a score of 0.6463 accuracies.
Our study differs from the literature with its extensive feature sets and its nature to predict sleep efficiency, contrary
to already applied classification techniques. We contribute to the literature by applying CNN architectures which
already performed well in the human activity recognition domain. We also compare the performance with an ensemble
model, i.e., RF. It is found that RF performs better compared to CNN architectures in the scope of our experiments.
3 METHODOLOGY
3.1 Dataset and Features
The data used in this study is gathered from the Nethealth dataset, which is collected at Notre Dame University. This
data covers eight semesters between Fall 2015 and Spring 2019. There are data on approximately 400 students from
2015 to 2017 and 300 from 2015 to 2019. Data collection comprises social networks, physical activity, sleep data, basic
survey data, communication data, courses and grades data, and academic calendar data. Basic survey data include
family background & demographic variables, student background, self-reported course, grade, major information,
activities, clubs, musical tastes, personality - Big five, and social-psychological scales tests. Besides these, physical and
psychological health-related questions, PSQI sleep quality test, political attributes and views, and computer, phone, and
Fitbit device usage of students are included.

NetHealth dataset is a comprehensive, multi-year longitudinal dataset. So, some survey questions were only asked in
some wave. The missing information restricts this study from using every wave in deep learning training. In this study,
we focus on Fitbit’s sleep quality scores as our target value.
In the scope of this study, we chose all wearable data modalities, i.e., activity and sleep. However, wearable sleep
data is chosen as the target value. Thus, it is not in the feature space. In addition, we added questionnaire responses
about bad habits, personality (BigFive), exercise, health, mental health, personal information, origin, and sex. The used
sub-datasets and corresponding features are listed in study [ 14] in Table 1. Due to space limit we were not able to
add the adjusted version in this paper. However, the parameter space remains the same but removed the courses and
grades features. There, the underscored numbers correspond to the semester’s indications. The feature space size before
pre-processing is 89without participantID, date, and the target value, which is sleep efficiency.
3.2 Preprocessing
As a target value in the scope of this study, we use the Fitbit sleep efficiency score that is collected from the wearable
- Fitbit. The device uses its sensors to detect if someone is awake or asleep. Besides this information, total time in
bed, awake time in bed, and sleeping time are also detected. Thanks to these values, the sleep efficiency score can be
calculated, i.e., 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 /(𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 +𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑤𝑎𝑘𝑒 ). The score is the ratio of asleep time in bed to the total time in
bed and ranges between 0and 1.
Before model evaluation, we concatenated all separated responses according to timestamps and participants. In
addition, we converted the survey questions into numeric models. Besides, there were missing values in some survey
responses for different semesters. In this study, we are concentrating on the first and second semester’s data due to
not being requested from the participants since the decided features have responses. Furthermore, students who still
need to answer the questionnaires are subtracted. In the end, we have 200615 rows and 92columns. In Figure 1, the
change of our target variable, i.e., sleep efficiency, over the first and second semesters can be observed. It consists of all
participants’ overall patterns in two semesters. Its range is between 0.93and 0.95. There were two peaks; one at the
beginning of the study in August 2015 and the other around September 2015. However, we can not comment on the
possible reasons since we do not know about the events that occur these days.

3.3 Model Details and Performance Metrics
In this study, we apply deep learning techniques as they perform better in literature [ 19]. More specifically, we
are concentrating on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures that perform well in the human activity
recognition domain [ 5,6,16–18]. As our measurements in the dataset are collected daily from wearables, we decided to
focus on the architectures utilized for daily activity recognition tasks. The selected architectures are listed in Table 1.
C, P, and FC stand for convolution layer, max-pooling layer, and fully connected layer, respectively. We applied these
selected architectures to both scenarios. The models differ from each other primarily on their complexities, and also, we
chose different kernel sizes already performed well, which are 3,5,12,20. We used ReLU activation for convolution
and linear activation for fully connected layers. Filter and pool size remained the same for all architectures, 32 and 2,
respectively.
Since our problem is prediction, mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) can be utilized as
performance metrics. MAE is calculated by considering the absolute average distance. MSE is calculated by averaging
the squared difference between the estimated and actual values. In our context, we used MAE due to its interpretability.
4 EVALUATION
4.1 Comparison of CNN models and Random Forest
In the dataset, we have continuous measurements for sleep efficiency. Thus, we modelled them as a prediction problem.
Again, we employed the same architectures, and obtained results are presented in Table 2. Architecture 2 is the best
performer based on MAE values. The change of MAE for the best one (C-P-C-P-FC) is given in Figure 2. In addition, we
implemented RF with 10estimators; its performance was found to be better than the CNN models. We think that this
may be related to the dataset characteristics since in [ 2], RF outperformed different deep learning models on the same
dataset but on a different task.

4.2 Important Factors
To understand the most affecting factors to sleep efficiency, we employed RF feature importance. 20top affecting ones
are presented in Figure 3. They are mostly related to Fitbit activity measurements. We got SRQE_introj (introjective
self-regulation for exercise), CESDOverall (CES depression score), Neuroticism (personality trait) from survey responses.
Also, we found mom age affects sleep efficiency somehow.

We re-ran the indicated architectures using only the selected most important factors. However, we got higher
MAE values compared to utilizing all factors. We can conclude that in this context even though the final performance
contribution is low for some features, when we exclude them, the overall prediction performance decreases.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this study, we predict sleep efficiency values collected from Fitbit devices. We applied the most promising CNN
architectures in the human activity domain. We also implemented conventional RF to be able to compare deep learning
results. We also extracted the most affecting factors using the feature importance technique.
Even though CNN predictions are promising and the best architecture is found as C-P-C-P-FC, RF performs the best
in our context but the difference is small in terms of MAE. This is probably due to the nature of the dataset since in [ 2],
authors applied different deep learning techniques, and it was found that RF performs the best in all cases.
We also experimented with the reduced size of features in the same scenario. However, it is found that deep learning
without feature extraction performs better compared to manually extracted features. Nevertheless, this feature ranking
provides us with a meaning for the interpretation. Among the best 20factors, sleep efficiency is affected by the
measurements from wearables related to the activity. There are also some survey-related factors, such as exercise,
depression, and personality-related responses. These are expected since, in literature, it is already shown that there is a
relation between sleep, stress, physical activity, and mood [ 4,8,10,15]. We contribute by working all these modalities
in one study in a multi-modal manner by applying deep learning methods over wearable and survey data collected in
an unrestricted environment.
We want to give ideas for future perspectives. In this study, we worked on a prediction problem, but the target value
range was narrow (between 0.93and 0.95). There were no high fluctuations. This may be the reason for obtaining
very accurate predictions and low errors. In addition, we focused on the application of algorithms by not considering
personal differences. This aspect may be examined in future studies. Furthermore, we did not consider the time-based
differences for a participant. One may examine personal changes over time periods, especially during exam dates and
holidays.
