Abstract. We describe a N= 2 supersymmetric Poisson vertex algebra structure of N= 1 (resp.
N= 0) classical W-algebra associated with sl(n+1|n) and the odd (resp. even) principal nilpotent
element. This N= 2 supersymmetric structure is connected to the principal sl(2|1)-embedding in
sl(n+ 1|n) superalgebras, which are the only basic Lie superalgebras that admit such a principal
embedding.
1.Introduction
Supersymmetric (SUSY) vertex algebras were introduced by K ac [28], generalizing the original
idea of Borcherds [9] for (bosonic) vertex algebras. Afterw ards, SUSY vertex algebras have been
studied in various aspects, see e.g. [3,5,24], and their str ucture theory was developed by Kac and
Heluani [25]. SUSY vertex algebras correspond to a mathemat ical deﬁnition of the chiral part of
two-dimensional (super)conformal ﬁeld theories studied b y physicists, since the years 80’s up to
nowadays, see e.g. [4,10,10,19,22,30,35,42,43] and refer ences therein for the historical physics
literature on the subject. Their structure of SUSY vertex al gebras includes a superﬁeld formalism,
commonly used in physics, for instance in superstrings theo ries [11,23] or super-Yang-Mills models
[6,7,16,20].
The aﬃne Lie algebras and the W-algebras are at the core of the study of these SUSY theories,
see e.g. [1,14,27,32]. However, although supersymmetric v ertex algebras may have as many
supersymmetries as one wishes, it is mainly the case N= 1 that is studied in the context of aﬃne
Lie algebras [29] and W-algebras [33,40]. Aﬃne Lie algebras, and W-algebras are studied both at
the quantum level (using vertex algebra and SUSY vertex alge bra formalism) and at the classical
level (with Poisson vertex algebras and SUSY Poisson vertex algebras).
Quantum and classical SUSY W-algebras can be understoodas H amiltonian reductions of N= 1
SUSY aﬃne vertex algebras in the quantum case or SUSY Poisson aﬃne vertex algebras in the
classical case. Asamethodof N= 1SUSYHamiltonianreduction,BRSTformalismwasintroduc ed
and this formalism gives rise to N= 1 SUSY quantum W-algebras [32,33]. On the other hand,
SUSY classical W-algebras are obtained as a quasi classical limit of SUSY quantum W-algebras
[40]. AN= 1 SUSY classical (resp. quantum) W-algebra Wk(¯g,f) (resp.Wk(¯g,f)) of level kis

ofgare given. Especially, for classical cases, their Poisson s tructures are well understood [40] and
when the given odd nilpotent element fis principal, the explicit forms of their generators can be
found by a column determinant of certain operator valued mat rices [38].
TheN= 2 SUSY W-algebras have been used since a long time in physics. They re present a
signiﬁcant extension of the already rich N=2 superconforma l symmetry. The algebraic structure
ofN= 2 superconformal algebra is particularly ﬁtted to the stud y of strings and superstrings.
Indeed, after a well-suited twist of the super conformal gen erators, it can be shown [21] that the
N= 2 superconformal algebra encode the BRST algebra for the bo sonic string. In that approach,
the BRST algebra contains, in addition to the stress energy t ensor, the BRST operator, together
with a ghost and an anti-ghost operators. Extension of this m ethod to the bosonic W-strings leads
naturally to the N= 2 SUSY W-algebras [8], which represent a signiﬁcant extension of th e already
richN= 2 superconformal symmetry. These algebras also appear as t he Hamiltonian structure of
theN= 2 Korteweg–de Vries or of the N= 2 Kadomtsev–Petriashvili hierarchies [13,31]. These
various lines of research have ignited a multitude of studie s on these algebras, with a particular
focus on the physical perspective [15,17,36].
However, from the mathematical side, the (Poisson) vertex a lgebra counterpart of the N= 2
SUSYW-algebras remains elusive, particularly within the framew ork ofN= 2 superﬁelds. The
objective of this paper is to bridge this gap concerning N= 2 SUSY structures of classical W-
algebras. In particular, we describe the N= 2 SUSY structures of the non-SUSY classical W-
algebraWk(sl(n+1|n),F) and the N= 1 SUSY classical W-algebra Wk(sl(n+1|n),f) associated
with the Lie superalgebra sl(n+ 1|n). Here Fis the even principal nilpotent and fis the odd
principal nilpotent. The reason we consider sl(n+1|n) is that it is the only basic Lie superalgebra
which has principal sl(2|1)-embedding [14], [36]. It is however expected that the eve n (resp. odd)
nilpotent element in any subalgebra isomorphic to sl(2|1) yields a N= 2 SUSY structure of
Wk(sl(n+1|n),F) (resp.Wk(sl(n+1|n),f)) [36].
In order to ﬁnd N= 2 SUSY structure of a Poisson vertex algebra, it is enough to ﬁnd a
N= 2 superconformal vector [25]. Inspired from this fact, we ﬁ nd aN= 2 superconformal
vector of Wk(sl(n+1|n),f) andN= 1 and N= 2 superconformal vector of Wk(sl(n+1|n),F).
More precisely, as main results of this paper, we prove the fo llowing statements (Theorem 5.2 and
Theorem 5.5):
• Wk(sl(n+1|n),F) hasN= 1,2 SUSY structures.
•There is a N= 1 (resp. N= 2) superconformal vector G(resp.J) ofWk(sl(n+1|n),F)
and a generating set as a N= 1 (resp. N= 1) SUSY Poisson vertex algebra consisting of
G-primary (resp. J-primary) elements.
• Wk(sl(n+1|n),f) hasN= 1,2 SUSY structures.
•There is a N= 1 (resp. N= 2) superconformal vector G(resp.J) ofWk(sl(n+1|n),f)
and a generating set as a N= 1 (resp. N= 2) SUSY Poisson vertex algebra consisting of
G-primary (resp. J-primary) elements.
In the proof of the listed results, we crucially use explicit formulas for λ-brackets of the classical
W-algebras which appear in [40]. Here the λ-bracket is a way to express the OPE relation between
two elements of a Poisson vertex algebra.N= 2 SUSY STRUCTURES ON CLASSICAL W-ALGEBRAS 3
The plan of the paper is the following. Some general properti es ofsl(n+ 1|n) with respect to
theirosp(1|2) andsl(2|1) principal embeddings are recalled in section 2. In sectio n 3, we review
the deﬁnition and some properties of supersymmetric Poisso n vertex algebras. Then, in section
4, the structure of N= 0,1 SUSY W-algebras is studied. Section 5 deals with N= 2 SUSY W-
algebras and contains the main results of the paper. We concl ude in section 6 on open problems.
An appendix gathers the technical proofs of the results pres ented in section 5.
2.sl(n+1|n)asosp(1|2)andsl(2|1)-module
It has been observed in [36] that we should consider basic Lie superalgebras with sl(2|1) embed-
dingto possibly get NK= 2 supersymmetrystructurein W-algebras. Therefore, a Liesuperalgebra
with principal sl(2|1)-embedding would be the ﬁrst thing to study for NK= 2 supersymmetry.
Proposition 2.1 ([14], [36]) .The only basic Lie superalgebras that admit a principal sl(2|1)-
embedding are sl(n+1|n)forn∈N.
We remind that the basic (or contragredient) Lie superalgebr as include the A(m,n) =sl(n+1|n)
unitary series, the B(m,n) =osp(2m+1|2n),C(n+1) =osp(2|2n), andD(m,n) =osp(2m|2n)
orthosymplectic series and the exceptional superalgebras F(4)andG(3)as well as D(2,1;α).
Proof.Assume that gis a basic Lie superalgebra that admits a principal sl(2|1)-embedding. Since
galso has a principal osp(1|2)-embedding, gshould be isomorphic to one of the followings:
sl(n±1|n),osp(M|2n) withM= 2n±1,2n+2,2n, D(2,1;α) withα∈C\{0,±1}.
Each type of the above Lie superalgebras has an irreducible osp(1|2)-module decomposition
sl(n−1|n)≃R2n−2⊕R2n−3⊕R2n−4⊕···R2⊕R1,
sl(n+1|n)≃R2n⊕R2n−1⊕R2n−2⊕···R2⊕R1,
osp(2n|2n)≃R4n−2⊕R4n−5⊕R4n−6⊕···⊕R3⊕R2⊕R2n−1,
osp(2n−1|2n)≃R4n−2⊕R4n−5⊕R4n−6⊕···⊕R3⊕R2,
osp(2n+1|2n)≃R4n−1⊕R4n−2⊕R4n−5⊕···⊕R3⊕R2,
D(2,1;α)≃2R2⊕R3,
whereRqis the ﬁnite irreducible osp(1|2)-module of dimension 2 q+1. Since sl(2|1)≃R2⊕R1as an
osp(1|2)-module, gshouldcontain R2⊕R1, whichis trueonlyfor sl(n+1|n),sl(n|n+1)≃sl(n+1|n)
andosp(2|2)≃sl(2|1). In these cases, one can check that the subspace R2⊕R1is isomorphic to
sl(2|1) as Lie superalgebras. /square
Considering the above proposition, this paper only deals wi thW-algebras associated with sl(n+
1|n), that we will denote gthroughout this section. As a start, we remind the module str ucture of
sl(n+1|n) as an adjoint representation of the principal sl(2|1) subalgebra.
2.1.sl(n+ 1|n)s anosp(1|2)module. We ﬁrst review the structure of gas anosp(1|2)-module
given by the adjoint representation of the principal osp(1|2) subalgebra.
Recall that osp(1|2) has a basis {H,E,F,e,f }satisfying the following properties:
(osp-1)His a nontrivial element in the Cartan subalgebra of osp(1|2),4 E. RAGOUCY, A. SONG, AND U.R. SUH

where [.,.] is the graded commutator, which is graded skewsymmetric an d obeys the graded Jacobi
identity. We denote by H,E,F,e,f ∈gthe elements in the principal osp(1|2) subalgebra of g
satisfying (osp-1)–(osp-4). With respect to the osp(1|2) embedding of g, we deﬁne a gradation of
g:
(2.1) g=/circleplusdisplay
i∈Z/2g(i),whereg(i) ={x∈g|[H,x] =ix}.
Recall that an irreducible osp(1|2)-module can beidentiﬁed byits dimension whichis odd. Let Ri
fori∈Z+be the irreducible module of osp(1|2) of dimension 2 i+1. Then the following proposition
holds (see, for example [41]).
Proposition 2.2. Consider gas anosp(1|2)-representation given by the adjoint action of the
principal osp(1|2)subalgebra. Then gdecomposes into the direct sum of irreducible representati ons:
(2.2) g=2n/circleplusdisplay
i=1Ri.
The irreducible component Riis decomposed into a sum of 1-dimensional subspaces Ri(j) :=
Ri∩g(j) forj∈1
2Zsuch that −i
2≤j≤i
2. Hence, if we take a highest weight vector vi∈Ri, then
(2.3) v(m)
i:= (adf)mvi
spansRi(i−m
2), 0≤m≤2i, andv(0)
i=viis the highest weight vector. In addition, we have
bases{v(0)
i|i= 1,2,···,2n}and{v(2i)
i|i= 1,2,···,2n}ofge:= ker(ad e) andgf:= ker(ad f),
respectively.
2.2.sl(n+1|n)as ansl(2|1)-module. In this section, we consider the principal sl(2|1)-embedding
ing. For the principal sl(2|1) subalgebra, ﬁx a basis {H,E,F,e,f, ˜e,˜f,U}satisfying the following
properties:
(sl-1)H,E,F,e,f have the properties (osp-1)–(osp-4),
(sl-2)H,−E,−F,˜e,˜falso obey (osp-1)–(osp-4),
(sl-3) [f,˜f] = [e,˜e] = 0,
(sl-4) [e,˜f] = [˜e,f] =U, [U,f] =−˜f, [U,˜f] =−f, [U,e] = ˜e, [U,˜e] =e.
To describe the adjoint representation of the principal sl(2|1) subalgebra, we use the gradation
(2.1) and the irreducible component Riin Proposition 2.2.
Lemma 2.3. Leta∈gbe any homogeneous element in the irreducible component Risatisfying
[U,a] = 0.Then the following properties hold.
(1) Both [E,a]and[F,a]are killed by adU.
(2) The following diagrams commute:N= 2 SUSY STRUCTURES ON CLASSICAL W-ALGEBRAS 5

Proof.Both statements can be directly deduced from Jacobi identit y of Lie bracket. /square
Sinceg(0) is abelian, any nonzero element in g(0) satisﬁes the assumption of Lemma 2.3. There-
fore, the highest weight vector v2i=v(0)
2iofR2iin (2.3) is also in the kernel of ad Uby Lemma 2.3
(1). Now we apply (2) of Lemma 2.3 repeatedly to get the follow ing commutative diagram:

−[f,[˜f,v2i]] v(1)

There is a similar picture for the lowest weight vector v(2i)

Note that the elements in the diagram with no adjacent horizo ntal arrows are killed by the
adjoint action of U. In addition, [ ˜f,v2i]∈ker(ade)∩g(i−1

R2i−1. Finally, we get the following irreducible decomposition o fgas ansl(2|1)-representation.
Theorem 2.4. Consider the principal sl(2|1)-embedding in g. Then
(2.5) g=n/circleplusdisplay
i=1/tildewideRi,/tildewideRi=R2i−1⊕R2i
gives the decomposition of ginto the direct sum of irreducible representations with res pect to the
adjoint action of the principal sl(2|1).6 E. RAGOUCY, A. SONG, AND U.R. SUH
Proof.Lemma 2.3 and the diagram (2.4) assure that each /tildewideRiis closed under the action of sl(2|1)
except for that of ˜ e. Hence it remains to show that [˜ e,v2i] = 0, that we prove by a downward
induction on i.
It is clear that [˜ e,v2n] = 0. Considering the grading (2.1) of g, we have
[˜e,v2n−2i] =2i−1/summationdisplay
j=0kj(adf)jv2n−2i+1+j
for some constants kj’s. Apply ad eon the both sides to get
0 =2i−1/summationdisplay
j=1kj(ade)(adf)jv2n−2i+1+j.
Then, since {(ade)(adf)jv2n−2i+1+j|j= 1,2,···,2i−1}are linearly independent, all kjforj≥1
should be zero. In other words, [˜ e,v2n−2i] =k0v2n−2i+1.By the induction hypothesis, we have

where the nonzero constant cjis deﬁned by [ ˜f,v2j] =cjv2j−1. Thus,k0is also zero. /square
3.Poisson vertex algebras and Supersymmetric Poisson vertex algebras
In this section, we review the deﬁnition of supersymmetric P oisson vertex algebras. For a de-
tailed explanation or further relation between supersymme tric vertex algebras and supersymmetric
Poisson vertex algebras, see the paper [25] of Heluani and Ka c.
3.1.Basic notations. In this section, we establish basic notations used througho ut this paper.
LetP=P¯0⊕P¯1be any vector superspace and a∈Pbe a homogeneous element. If a∈P¯0(resp.
a∈P¯1), then the parity is deﬁned by p(a) = 0 (resp. p(a) = 1).
Let us consider endomorphisms on P, denoted as Diand∂, whereDiis odd and ∂is even. The
tuple of endomorphisms Diand∂is denoted by
(3.1) ∇:= (∂,D1,···DN),
provided that they satisfy the relations
(3.2) [ Di,Dj] = 2δi,j∂,[∂,Di] = 0.
Additionally, we let C[∇] be the unital superassociative algebra generated by ∇.
We also consider unital superassociative algebra C[Λ] generated by
(3.3) Λ := ( λ,χ1,···,χN)
subject to the relation
(3.4) [ λ,χi] = 0,[χi,χj] =−2δi,jλ,N= 2 SUSY STRUCTURES ON CLASSICAL W-ALGEBRAS 7
whereλis even and χi’s are odd. One can view the vector superspace C[Λ]⊗Pas aC[∇]-module
with
(3.5) Di(χja) =−χjDi(a)+2δijλa
fora∈P, where the tensor product notation is omitted.
3.2.Supersymmetric Poisson vertex algebras.
Deﬁnition 3.1. ANK=Nsupersymmetric (SUSY) Lie conformal algebra is a Z/2Z-graded
C[∇]-module Rwith aC-linear map {·Λ·}:R⊗R→C[Λ]⊗CRof parity N(mod 2) satisfying
the following three axioms:
(sesquilinearity) {DiaΛb}=−(−1)Nχi{aΛb},{aΛDib}= (−1)p(a)+N(Di+χi){aΛb},
(skewsymmetry) {bΛa}=−(−1)p(a)p(b)+N{b−Λ−∇a},
(Jacobi identity)
{aΛ{bΓc}}= (−1)(p(a)+1)N/braceleftbig
{aΛb}Γ+Λc/bracerightbig
+(−1)(p(a)+N)(p(b)+N){bΓ{aΛc}}.
fora,b∈R,i= 1,2,···,NandΛ,Γtwo diﬀerent tuples of the form (3.3).
To be more precise, the axioms are understood in the followin g way.
(i) The RHS of the sesquilinearity and skewsymmetry relation s can be computed by the C[∇]-
module structure of C[Λ]⊗R,
(ii) The Jacobi identity is an equality in C[Λ,Γ]⊗Rand an element in Λsupercommutes with an
element in Γ.
By performing the sesquilinearity twice, we get
(3.6) {∂aΛb}=−λ{aΛb},{aΛ∂b}= (∂+λ){aΛb},
whichareknownassesquilinearitiesofPVA.Inparticular, whenN= 0, anC[∂]-module Rsatisfying
the skewsymmetry, Jacobi identity and (3.6) is simply calle d a Lie conformal algebra. In this case,
we usually denote the Λ-bracket by {·λ·}.
If the superspace has in addition a unital supercommutative , superassociative C-algebra struc-
ture, which is compatible with the Λ-bracket, then we call it theNK=Nsupersymmetric Poisson
vertex algebra.
Deﬁnition 3.2. ANK=Nsupersymmetric (SUSY) Poisson vertex algebra (PVA) is a tup le
(P,1,∇,{·Λ·},·), where
•(P,∇,{·Λ·})is aNK=NSUSY Lie conformal algebra,
•(P,1,Di,·)is a unital supercommutative superassociative diﬀerentia l algebra with odd deriva-
tionsDifori= 1,2,···,N,
•(Leibniz rule) {aΛbc}={aΛb}c+(−1)(p(a)+N)p(b)b{aΛc}for anya,b,c∈P.
In particular, the NK= 0SUSY PVA is simply called a PVA.
Deﬁnition 3.3. LetPbe aNK=NSUSY PVA. An element G∈Pof parity N(mod2)is called
aNK=Nsuperconformal vector of central charge c∈Cif it satisﬁes the two following conditions.8 E. RAGOUCY, A. SONG, AND U.R. SUH

HereO(Λ2)is a polynomial in Λ, whose constant and linear terms are vanishing. Then
P=/circleplustext
∆≥MP∆for some M∈R.
IfPhas a superconformal vector, P=/circleplustextP∆is called the conformal weight decomposition of P. In
addition, the value ∆in(3.8)is called the conformal weight of awith respect to G. In the physics
literature, an element asatisfying (3.8)is called quasi-primary. Moreover, if O(Λ2) = 0in(3.8),
we say that ais (G−)primary of conformal weight ∆. For later use, we note that a∈P∆is primary
if and only if
(3.9) {aΛG}= (−1)p(a)N+N/parenleftBigg
(2∆−2+N)∂+2∆λ+N/summationdisplay
i=1χiDi/parenrightBigg
a.
Additionally, when N= 0,Gis commonly referred to as a conformal vector.
Remark 3.4. In many references (see e.g. [28]), whenN= 0, a conformal vector Lof a PVA is
deﬁned through the Virasoro relation:
(3.10) {LλL}= (∂+2λ)L+c
6λ3
for some constant c. The RHS of (3.10)is the half of our relation (3.7)for the conformal vector.
Then, an element Lin a PVA is a conformal vector with respect to the relation (3.10)if and only
if2Lis a conformal vector with respect to (3.7). However, the two deﬁnitions of conformal vectors
give rise to the same conformal weight decomposition.
Remark 3.5. There is another kind of SUSY PVA called a NWSUSY PVA introduced in [25].
However, in this paper, we only deal with NK= 0,1,2SUSY PVAs and simply denote them by
N= 0,1,2SUSY PVAs.
3.3.Relation between SUSY PVAs. To understand the structure of SUSY PVAs, we observe
the relation between them. Especially, we see the relations between N= 0,1 and 2 Poisson
structures. In the rest of this paper, we ﬁx
(3.11)∇= (∂,D,˜D),Λ= (λ,χ,˜χ),
∇= (∂,D),Λ = (λ,χ),˜∇= (∂,˜D),˜Λ = (λ,˜χ),N= 2 SUSY STRUCTURES ON CLASSICAL W-ALGEBRAS 9
all of which satisfy the relations introduced in section 3.1 . We also adopt a uniform notation for
the coeﬃcients of each N= 0,1,2 Poisson bracket as

Proposition-Deﬁnition 3.6. Suppose Pis aN= 1or2SUSY PVA. Then Pis aN= 0PVA

In the spirit of (3.12), theλ-bracket in (3.13)is equivalent to a(n):=a(n|I).
Moreover, if Pis aN= 2SUSY PVA, each of the following Λor˜Λ-bracket

makesPaN= 1SUSY PVA.
Proof.Note that (3.13) is obtained by selecting only those terms fr om the Λ (resp. Λ)-bracket
in (3.12) that contain the variable χ(resp.χ˜χ). Therefore, one can show that (3.13) is indeed a
Poisson bracket by comparing the coeﬃcients of χ(resp.χ˜χ) in each of (3.6) and conditions in
Deﬁnition 3.1. The last statement is also true for a similar r eason. /square
In the rest of this paper, even in the context of N= 1 or 2 SUSY PVA, we will use the expression
a(n)to refer to a(n|I)for I in (3.13). In addition, focusing on the interrelation b etweenN= 0,1,and
2 SUSY structures, one can check by sesquilinearity that (3. 12), (3.13) and (3.14) are correlated as
{aΛb}={Daλb}+χ{aλb},{a˜Λb}={˜Daλb}+ ˜χ{aλb}, (3.15)
{aΛb}={˜DDaλb}−χ{˜Daλb}+ ˜χ{Daλb}−χ˜χ{aλb} (3.16)
=−{˜DaΛb}+ ˜χ{aΛb}={Da˜Λb}−χ{a˜Λb},
whenPis aN= 1 or 2 SUSY PVA. For example, when Pis aN= 1 SUSY PVA, one can
obtain (Da)(n|1)=a(n|0)by comparing the coeﬃcients of χin{DaΛb}=χ{aΛb}. Then this result
demonstrates the ﬁrst equality in (3.15).
Now, it is natural to ask whether the existence of an addition al odd derivation on N= 0 or 1
SUSY PVA would lead to an additional SUSY structure if we use ( 3.15) or (3.16). To investigate
this possibility, we deﬁne the induced brackets in an obviou s way, when a N= 0 or 1 SUSY PVA
has an odd derivation Dor˜D. Each bracket induced by Λ, ˜Λ,Λwill be denoted by
{·Λ·}−,{·˜Λ·}−,{·Λ·}−,
respectively. The induced bracket {·Λ·}−can be deﬁned on any PVA when it is equipped with any
odd derivation D. However, these induced brackets may not be Poisson bracket s. If the induced10 E. RAGOUCY, A. SONG, AND U.R. SUH
brackets are indeed Poisson brackets, then they satisfy the relations (3.15) and (3.16) again. The
following propositions provide criteria for induced brack ets to be Poisson brackets.
Proposition 3.7. LetPbe a PVA. The following two statements are equivalent:
(1)(P,1,∇,{·Λ·}−,·)is aN= 1SUSY PVA,
(2) There exists an odd derivation D:P→Psatisfying
(3.17) D2=∂, D{aλb}={Daλb}+(−1)p(a){aλDb}
for anya,b∈P.
Here, we assume that {·Λ·}−is induced by {·λ·}as in(3.15).
Proof.LetPbe aN= 1 SUSY PVA. Comparing the coeﬃcients of χin the sesquilinearity
D{aΛb}−−(−1)p(a)+1{aΛDb}−=−χ{aΛb}−, one gets
(3.18) Da(n|1)b+(−1)p(a)+1a(n|1)Db=a(n|0)b.
In terms of the non-SUSY structure of P, (3.18) is equivalent to (3.17). Now, assume (2) and
check if the induced Λ-bracket {·Λ·}−satisﬁes sesquilinearity, skewsymmetry and Jacobi identi ty.
By computation, we have
(3.19) {DaΛb}−={∂aλb}+χ{Daλb}=χ(χ{aλb}+{Daλb}) =χ{aΛb}−
and
(3.20){aλDb}=/summationdisplay

By (3.20), one can deduce
(3.21){aΛDb}−=χ/parenleftbig

= (−1)p(a)+1(χ+D)/parenleftbig
{Daλb}+χ{aλb}/parenrightbig
= (−1)p(a)+1(χ+D){aΛb}−.
Hence weget thesesquilinearity from(3.19) and (3.21). The skewsymmetry of theΛ-bracket follows
from the skewsymmetry of PVA P. More precisely, we have
{a−Λ−∇b}−={Da−λ−∂b}−(χ+D){a−λ−∂b}
= (−1)p(b)(p(a)+1)+1{bλDa}−(χ+D)(−1)p(a)p(b)+1{bλa}
= (−1)p(a)p(b)/parenleftbig
{Dbλa}−D{bλa}+(χ+D){bλa}/parenrightbig
= (−1)p(a)p(b){bΛa}−.
Similarly, the Jacobi identity of Λ-bracket follows from th at ofλ-bracket and (3.20).

Proposition 3.8. LetPbe a PVA. The following three statements are equivalent.N= 2 SUSY STRUCTURES ON CLASSICAL W-ALGEBRAS 11
(1)(P,1,∇,{·Λ·}−,·)is aN= 2SUSY PVA,
(2)(P,1,∇,{·Λ·}−,·)is aN= 1SUSY PVA with an odd derivation ˜DonPsatisfying ˜D2=∂,
[D,˜D] = 0and˜D{aΛb}−=−{˜DaΛb}−+(−1)p(a)+1{aΛ˜Db}−for anya,b∈P,
(3)Phas two supercommuting odd derivations Dand˜Dsatisfying D2=˜D2=∂andD{aλb}=
{Daλb}+(−1)p(a){aλDb},˜D{aλb}={˜Daλb}+(−1)p(a){aλ˜Db}for anya,b∈P.
Proof.The equivalence of (2) and (3) is immediate from Proposition 3.7, so we only need to show
that (1) and (2) are equivalent. If Pis aN= 2 SUSY PVA, then the N= 1 SUSY PVA structure
ofPis guaranteed by Proposition-Deﬁnition 3.6. Additionally , the properties of ˜Dcan be checked
using sesquilinearity, as illustrated in the proof of Propo sition 3.7. One can prove the opposite by
the computation similar to (3.21). /square
In the following, when induced brackets are Poisson bracket s, we shall omit the “ −” symbol in
the induced brackets.
Thus, to ﬁnd an additional SUSY structure, one has ﬁrst to ide ntify an odd derivation Dthat
satisﬁes (3.17). For any given element τin a PVA, τ(0)is a derivation that meets the second
condition of (3.17), as it can be deduced from Jacobi identit y and Leibniz rule. Therefore, we can
takeD:=τ(0)whenever τis an odd element satisfying [ τ(0),τ(0)] = (τ(0)τ)(0)= 2∂.
At this point, conformal vectors come into play. Note that th e last condition for τis achieved
whenτ(0)τis a conformal vector. Hence, we assume that
(1)τ(0)τis indeed a conformal vector, allowing us to put D:=τ(0),
(2)τis primary of conformal weight3
2with respect to τ(0)τ.
Then, in terms of the induced Λ-bracket, we get an equation
(3.22) {τΛτ}−= (2∂+3λ+χD)τ+O(Λ2),
which has to be compared with the Deﬁnition 3.3 for a N= 1 superconformal vector. Thefollowing
theorem shows how to get a superconformal vector along with a n additional SUSY structure and
determines the conformal weight decomposition of P.
Theorem 3.9. LetPbe a PVA with a conformal vector Lof central charge c∈C. Suppose that
there are primary elements Gandai, i∈ I, such that Gis odd,
(3.23) {GλG}=L+λ2
3c,{Gλai}=G(0)ai, i∈ I,
and the set {G,L} ∪{ai,G(0)ai}i∈Ifreely generates Pas aC[∂]-algebra. Then, for D:=G(0),P
is aN= 1SUSY PVA with a N= 1superconformal vector G. Moreover, Pis freely generated by
the set{G}∪{ai}i∈Ias aC[∇]-algebra, where {ai}i∈Iconsists of G-primary elements.
Proof.Given that the conformal weight of G(0)G=Lis 2,Ghas conformal weight3
2. Therefore,
by the preceding argument of this theorem, one can take D:=G(0)to get aN= 1 SUSY structure.
From the L-primarity of Gand the ﬁrst condition in (3.23), it follows that
(3.24) {DGλG}= (2∂+3λ)G,{GλG}=DG+λ2
3c.
This is equivalent to (3.7) if we use (3.15). The remaining co nditions prove the G-primarity of ai
in a similar way. /square12 E. RAGOUCY, A. SONG, AND U.R. SUH
Following a similar argument as in the proof of Theorem 3.9, o ne can also prove the following
theorem.
Theorem 3.10. LetPbe aN= 1SUSY PVA with a N= 1superconformal vector Gof central
chargec∈C. Suppose that there are primary elements Jandai,i∈ I, such that Jis even,
(3.25) {JΛJ}=−G−λχ
3c,{JΛai}=J(0|0)ai,
and the set {J,G}∪{ai,J(0|0)ai}freely generates Pas aC[∇]-algebra. Then, for ˜D:=J(0|0),Pis
aN= 2SUSY PVA with a N= 2superconformal vector J. Moreover, Pis freely generated by the
set{J}∪{ai}i∈Ias aC[∇]-algebra, where {ai}i∈Iconsists of J-primary elements.
Proof.The proof is similar to that of Theorem 3.9. Note that the cond ition (3.7) for Jto be a
N= 2 superconformal vector is equivalent to
(3.26) {˜DJΛJ}=−(2∂+2λ+χD)J,{JΛJ}=˜DJ−λχ
3c.
/square
Remark 3.11.
(1) One can also show that each of the converse statements of Th eorem 3.9 and 3.10 is also
true. For example, if Pis aN= 1SUSY PVA with a N= 1superconformal vector G, and
Pis freely generated by G-primary elements and Gitself, then (i) D=G(0), (ii)L:=DG
is a conformal vector, (iii) (3.23)holds and (iv) Pis freely generated by L-primary elements
andLitself asC[∂]-algebra. This converse statement can be shown using (3.24)and(3.20).
(2) Taking into account the converse of Theorem 3.10, −˜DJis aN= 1superconformal vector
with the induced Λ-bracket, if Jis aN= 2superconformal vector. Changing the role of
(D,χ)and(˜D,˜χ), one can also say that DJis aN= 1superconformal vector, but with
the˜Λ-bracket introduced in (3.14).
Forlateruse, weemphasizeheretheequalitiestocheckfora nexistenceofa N= 2superconformal

Theorem 3.12. LetPbe aN= 2SUSY PVA. An even element JofPsatisﬁes (3.7)if and only

{D˜DJλJ}=−(2∂+2λ)J,{˜DJλJ}=−DJ,{DJλJ}=˜DJ,{JλJ}=−λ

Furthermore, for a N= 2superconformal vector JofP, an element a∈PisJ-primary if and

{D˜DJλa}=−(2∂+2∆λ)a,{˜DJλa}=−Da,{DJλa}=˜Da,{Jλa}= 0.
3.4.Reconstruction Theorem and Examples. In this section, we explain a way to get a freely
generated SUSY PVA from NK=Na SUSY Lie conformal algebra and see some examples. We
ﬁx∇,Λ,∇and Λ as in (3.11). First, we have the well-known reconstruct ion theorem for N= 0.
Theorem 3.13 (Reconstruction Theorem [28]) .LetRbe a Lie conformal algebra. Then the
supersymmetric algebra S(R) :=S(R¯0)⊗/logicalandtext(R¯1)is a PVA, whose λ-bracket is induced from the
bracket of Rby Leibniz rule.N= 2 SUSY STRUCTURES ON CLASSICAL W-ALGEBRAS 13
Using Proposition 3.7 and 3.8, we get the supersymmetric ver sion of the reconstruction theorem.
Theorem 3.14. LetRbe aN= 1(resp.N= 2) SUSY Lie conformal algebra. Then the
supersymmetric algebra S(R)has aN= 1(resp.N= 2) SUSY PVA structure, whose Λ(resp.
Λ)-bracket is induced from that of Rby Leibniz rule, and D(resp.Dand˜D) is extended to the
derivation on S(R).
Proof.ForN= 1 case, we use Proposition 3.7 and Theorem 3.13. Since Ris a Lie conformal
algebra via the λ-bracket (3.13), the supersymmetric algebra S(R) is a PVA by Theorem 3.13.
Since the odd derivation DonS(R) satisﬁes [ D,a(n)] = (Da)(n), Proposition 3.7 tells that S(R) is
aN= 1 SUSY PVA. For N= 2 case, we use Proposition 3.8 and Theorem 3.13. /square
Furthermore, the following proposition saves us some eﬀort t o check axioms of SUSY Lie con-
formal algebra.
Proposition 3.15 ([2,12,25]) .LetVbe a vector superspace and R=C[∂]⊗V. Suppose Vis
endowed with a linear map {·λ·}:V⊗V→C[λ]⊗Rof even parity.
(1) If{·λ·}onV⊗Vsatisﬁes skewsymmetry and Jacobi identity, then the bracke t{·λ·}:R⊗R→
C[λ]⊗Rextended from the bracket of Vby sesquilinearity gives Ra Lie conformal algebra
structure.
(2) Analogous statements are also true when we replace (λ,∂)by(Λ,∇)or(Λ,∇), even parity
map{·λ·}by an odd parity map {·Λ·}or an even parity map {·Λ·}, and Lie conformal
algebra by a N= 1orN= 2SUSY Lie conformal algebra.
Now we end this section by introducing aﬃne PVAs and N= 1 SUSY aﬃne PVAs and their

4.Poisson structures on (SUSY) Walgebras
Letgbe a simple ﬁnite dimensional Lie superalgebra with a nondeg enerate even supersymmetric
invariant bilinear form ( ·|·). Suppose ghas a subalgebra swhich is isomorphic to osp(1|2). We ﬁx
aC-basis{E,F,H,e,f }ofssatisfying the properties (osp-1)–(osp-4) in section 2.1, and assume
that the bilinear form is normalized as ( E|F) = 1. Consider the ad H-grading on g:
(4.1) g=/circleplusdisplay

and the subspaces
(4.2) n=/circleplusdisplay
i>0g(i),p=/circleplusdisplay

Note that whenever we take an odd nilpotent element fin a subalgebra isomorphic to osp(1|2),
normalized as in (osp-1)–(osp-4), it completely determine s the grading (4.1).
4.1.N= 1SUSYW-algebra Wk(¯g,f).Recall Λ and ∇in (3.11), and the N= 1 SUSY aﬃne

(4.3) ¯ ρ:C[Λ]⊗Vk(¯g)→C[Λ]⊗S(C[∇]⊗¯p)
such that ¯ ρ(λ) =λ, ¯ρ(χ) =χ, ¯ρ(¯n) = (f|¯n) and ¯ρ(¯p) = ¯pfor ¯n∈¯nand ¯p∈¯p.
TheN= 1 SUSY classical W-algebra associated with gandfis

where ad¯ n(w) ={¯nΛw}for the Λ-bracket of Vk(¯g). One can check that Wk(¯g,f) has aN= 1
SUSY PVA structure with respect to the bracket induced from t hat ofVk(¯g). We will loosely write,
{w1 Λw2}:= ¯ρ({w1Λw2})N= 2 SUSY STRUCTURES ON CLASSICAL W-ALGEBRAS 15
forw1,w2∈ Wk(¯g,f), where the Λ-bracket on the RHS is the bracket of Vk(¯g).
Now, we describe1
2Z+-grading ∆ on S(C[∇]⊗¯p) which also induces a grading on Wk(¯g,f),
called aconformal weight decomposition. The ∆-grading on S(C[∇]⊗¯p) is deﬁned by
(4.5) ∆(¯ a) =1
2−ja,∆(AB) = ∆(A)+∆(B),∆(D(A)) =1
2+∆(A)
fora∈g(ja) andA,B∈S(C[∇]⊗¯p). Note that one can consider the ∆-grading of ¯ afor any
a∈gf, sincegfis a subspace of p. This follows from the fact that gf⊂gF, and that (4.1) is a
good grading, which implies that gF:= ker(ad F)⊂p. For the deﬁntion and the classiﬁcation of
good grading on basic Lie superalgebras, we refer to [26].
Remark 4.1. Fork∝\e}atio\slash= 0, the conformal weight decomposition of Wk(¯g,f)is indeed the decomposi-
tion obtained as in (2) of Deﬁnition 3.3. Recall the supercon formal vector τofVk(¯g)in(3.30). The
elementGg,f= ¯ρ(τ)−2∂HinWk(¯g,f)is then a N= 1superconformal vector, whose conformal
weight decomposition coincides with (4.5). However, at that point, it is still unknown whether the
W-algebra is generated by Gg,fandGg,f-primary elements.
Proposition 4.2. [40]Fix a basis {˜vi
(0)|i∈ I}ofgfwhose elements are homogeneous with respect
to the grading (4.1)and the parity. Then for each i∈ I, there is an element ωi∈ Wk(¯g,f)whose
linear part without total derivatives is ¯˜vi
(0)and the conformal weight is ∆(ωi) = ∆(¯˜vi
(0)). Moreover,
suchωi’s fori∈ Igenerate Wk(¯g,f)as a diﬀerential algebra.
The generators ωi’s in Proposition 4.2 can be determined using the method of La x operator
[12] or row determinant formula [33,38] when gis of basic type and fis principal. Note that
the generators of the W-algebra satisfying Proposition 4.2 may not be unique. For e xample, if
∆(ωi) = ∆(ωj)−1
2for some i,j∈ I, then/tildewideωj=ωj+D(ωi)∈ Wk(¯g,f) can replace ωj.
However, we can ﬁx uniquely the elements ωiby imposing the following property. By the
osp(1|2)-representation theory, we have
(4.6) gf⊕[e,g] =g.
Hence any element in S(C[∇]⊗¯g) can be uniquely decomposed in the following way:
(4.7) A=/summationdisplay
m∈Z+γm(A),
whereγm(A)∈S(C[∇]⊗¯gf)⊗(C[∇]⊗[e,g])⊗m. If we require that each ωi∈ Wk(g,f) satisﬁes
the additional relation γ0(wi) =¯˜vi
(0), then such wiis unique. This uniqueness of generators allows
us to consider the diﬀerential superalgebra isomorphism
(4.8) ω:S(C[∇]⊗¯gf)→ Wk(¯g,f),¯˜vi
(0)∝ma√sto→ω(¯˜vi
(0)) =ωi,
whereωi’s are the uniquegenerators of the W-algebra, determined by Proposition 4.2 and the extra
property γ0(wi) =¯˜vi
(0).

4.3.Poisson structure on Wk(g,F).Inthis section, we brieﬂyreview on a non-SUSY W-algebra
and the corresponding non-SUSY version of Theorem 4.4. ([40 ])
Recall that Vk(g) is a classical aﬃne PVA of level kintroduced in Example 3.16. Let
(4.18) ρ:C[λ]⊗Vk(g)→C[λ]⊗S(C[∂]⊗q)
be a diﬀerential algebra homomorphism such that ρ(λ) =λ,ρ(n) = (F|n) andρ(q) =qforn∈n
andq∈q, wherenandqare deﬁned in (4.2). The classical W-algebra associated with gandfof
levelkis
(4.19) Wk(g,F) ={w∈S(C[∂]⊗q)|ρ(adn(w)) = 0 for n∈n}.
Here adn(w) ={nλw}for theλ-bracket on Vk(g) andWk(g,F) is the PVA via the bracket
inherited from Vk(g).
Theconformal weight ∆ onWk(g,F) is induced from the gradation on S(C[∂]⊗q) such that
(4.20) ∆( a) = 1−ja,∆(AB) = ∆(A)+∆(B),∆(∂(A)) = 1+∆( A)
fora∈g(ja) andA,B∈S(C[∂]⊗q).
Proposition 4.6. Fix a basis {q(ri)
i|i∈ I} ⊂gofgFwhose elements are homogeneous with respect
to the grading (4.1)and the parity. Then for each i∈ I, there is an element νi∈ Wk(g,F)whose18 E. RAGOUCY, A. SONG, AND U.R. SUH
linear part without total derivatives is q(ri)
iand conformal weight is ∆(νi) = ∆(q(ri)
i). Moreover,
suchνi’s fori∈ Igenerate Wk(g,F)as a diﬀerential algebra.
By thesl2-representation theory, we have a decomposition
(4.21) gF⊕[E,g] =g,
which induces a natural projection map π0:S(C[∂]⊗g)→S(C[∂]⊗gF). As in N= 1 SUSY
case, one can show the uniqueness of the elements νi’s inWk(g,F) satisfying Proposition 4.6 and
π0(νi) =q(di)
i, which in turn gives a well-deﬁned diﬀerential superalgebra isomorphism

Take homogeneous bases {q(ri)

Before ending this section, we show that, as in N= 1 SUSY case, the conformal weight ∆ on
Wk(g,F) is indeed the weight decomposition (2) of Deﬁnition 3.3, wh enk∝\e}atio\slash= 0. However, in the
this case, we also have the primary generators.N= 2 SUSY STRUCTURES ON CLASSICAL W-ALGEBRAS 19

5.Additional SUSY structures on Wk(sl(n+1|n),f)andWk(sl(n+1|n),F)
In this section, let g=sl(n+1|n) andfbe the odd principal nilpotent. Note that the conditions
(sl-1)–(sl-4) in section 2.2 completely determines the pri ncipalsl(2|1) subalgebra R1⊕R2⊂gand
its basis elements H,E,F,e,f, ˜e,˜f,U. Additionally, assume that kis a nonzero constant in C.
5.1.N=2 SUSY structure on Wk(sl(n+1|n),f).Recall that in Theorem 3.10, we found a way
to ﬁnd a N= 2 superconformal vector along with an additional SUSY stru cture in N= 1 SUSY
PVA. In this section, we use this theorem to get Theorem 5.2, o ne of the main results of this paper.
We show how to extend a N= 0 orN= 1 SUSY W-algebra to a N= 1 orN= 2 structure. The
setWhof primary elements of the starting N= 0 (resp. N= 1)W-algebra is related to the set of
highest weight vectors of h=sl2(resp.h=osp(1|2)) ing. The primary elements of the enlarged
SUSY structure will be a subset of Wh.
Proposition 5.1. Recall the isomorphism ωin(4.8). We have

Moreover, we have a set of G-primary elements WN=1
osp(1|2)={ω(¯v(2j)
j)|j= 1,3,4,···,2n}such that
WN=1
osp(1|2)∪{G}freely generates Wk(¯g,f)as aC[∇]-algebra.
Proof.We give the proof in section A.1. /square
Proposition 5.1 shows that the conditions of Theorem 3.10 ar e veriﬁed. Let us denote
(5.1) J=√−1
kω(¯˜f) andG=−2
k2ω(¯F).
Then,JandGwill satisfy the conditions in Theorem 3.10, if we further ﬁn dG-primary generators
ofWk(sl(n+1|n),f) satisfying the second equality of (3.25). This is done in th e following theorem.
Theorem 5.2. Let˜D:=J(0|0)forJin(5.1). ThenWk(¯g,f)endowed with ∇= (∂,D,˜D)is
aN= 2SUSY PVA with a N= 2superconformal vector J. Furthermore, the set WN=2
osp(1|2)=
{ω(¯v(4i−2)
2i−1)|i= 2,3,···n}consists of J-primary elements, and WN=2
osp(1|2)∪ {J}freely generates
Wk(¯g,f)as aC[∇]-algebra.

5.2.SUSY structures of Wk(sl(n+1|n),F).In this section, we describe SUSY PVA structures
ofWk(g,F) forg=sl(n+1|n).
Proposition 5.3. Letνbe the isomorphism in (4.22). Then
(1)ν(f)(0)ν(f) =−2ν(F)+1
2(ν(U))2,ν(˜f)(0)ν(˜f) = 2ν(F)−1

Proof.By Theorem 4.8, it is known that ( ν(F)−1
4(ν(U))2)(0)=k∂, (2) directly follows. For (1),
we use Theorem 4.7. More precisely, if a=b=f(resp.a=b=˜f) then the only nonzero terms
withoutλin (4.24) are ν([a,b]) and

inWk(g,F)and letD:=G(0)and˜D:=˜G(0). ThenWk(sl(n+1|n),F)endowed with ∇= (∂,D,˜D)
is aN= 2SUSY PVA.
Proof.The theorem follows from Proposition 3.8 and Proposition 5. 3. /square
Theorem 5.5. RecallG,D=G(0),˜Gand˜D=˜G(0)in Theorem 5.4 and let

˜Λbrackets, respectively, and Jis aN= 2superconformal vector of Wk(g,F)with respect to the

(1) The set WN=1
sl2={ν(v(2j−1)

WN=1
sl2∪{G}freely generates Wk(g,F)as aC[∇]-algebra,
(2) The set/tildewiderWN=1
sl2={ν(v(4i′−2)
2i′−1),ν(v(4i−3)
2i−1)|i′= 2,3,···,n, i= 1,2,···,n}consists of ˜G-
primary elements and /tildewiderWN=1
sl2∪˜Gfreely generates Wk(g,F)as aC[˜∇]-algebra,
(3) The set WN=2
sl2={ν(v(4i−3)
2i−1)|i= 2,···,n}consists of J-primary elements and WN=2
sl2∪{J}
freely generates Wk(g,F)as aC[∇]-algebra.
Proof.See section A.3. /square
Remark 5.6. We remind that the highest weight vectors of sl2(resp.osp(1|2); resp.sl(1|2)) are
given by v(2i)
i, v(2i−1)
i,i= 1,2,...,2n(resp.v(2i)
i,i= 1,2,...,2n; resp.v(4i)
2i,i= 1,2,...,n).
For the second osp(1|2)superalgebra generated by ˜eand˜f, the highest weights are v(4i)
2i,v(4i−1)
2i,
i= 1,2,...,n. Then, the correspondence between the sets WN=0
sl2,WN=1
osp(1|2)andWN=2
osp(1|2)and theN= 2 SUSY STRUCTURES ON CLASSICAL W-ALGEBRAS 21
highest weight vectors of sl2,osp(1|2)andsl(1|2)respectively is immediate. However, one may
wonder how the sets WN=n
sl2,n>0are related to these highest weight vectors. It is done in the
following way. For simplicity’s sake, we note ∝for equalities up to multiplication by non-zero
numbers. We ﬁrst consider the set WN=1
sl2. SinceD=G(0)∝ν(f), thenD(ν(v(2i−1)
i))∝ν(v(2i)
i)
and we recover the highest weight vectors of osp(1|2). In the same way, for /tildewiderWN=1
sl2,˜D=˜G(0)∝ν(˜f),
so that˜D(ν(v(4i−2)
2i−1))∝ν(v(4i)
2i)and˜D(ν(v(4i−3)
2i−1))∝ν(v(4i−1)
2i). The case WN=2
sl2is dealt similarly
using both Dand˜D.
6.Open questions
The results presented in the core of the paper concern mainly N= 2 SUSY, but the propositions
presented in section 3 deal with the chain N= 0֒→N= 1֒→N= 2 of SUSY PVAs, which can
be easily generalized to a N=n−1֒→N=nchain of SUSY PVAs. The proofs are essentially
the same as for N= 2, so that we don’t reproduce them, and just present the prop ositions.
In this section, Λ denotes the tuple ( λ,χ1,···,χn−1) andΛthe tuple ( λ,χ1,···,χn). In the
same way, we note ∇= (∂,D1,···,Dn−1) and∇= (∂,D1,···,Dn). We set
(6.1) {aΛb}−= (−1)n−1{DnaΛb}+χn{aΛb}.
Proposition 6.1. LetPbe aN=n−1SUSY PVA. The following two statements are equivalent:
(1)(P,1,∇,{·Λ·}−,·)is aN=nSUSY PVA,
(2) There exists an odd derivation Dn:P→Psatisfying
(6.2) D2
n=∂, D n{aΛb}= (−1)n−1{DnaΛb}+(−1)p(a)+n−1{aΛDnb}
for anya,b∈P.
This proposition allows to consider a chain N= 0֒→N= 1֒→ ···֒→N=nof SUSY PVAs,
in the spirit of Proposition 3.8.
Theorem 6.2. LetPbe aN=n−1SUSY PVA with a N=n−1superconformal vector Gof
central charge c∈C. Suppose that there are primary elements Jandai,i∈ I, such that Jis of
parity(−1)n,
(6.3) {JΛJ}= (−1)n−1/parenleftBig
G+λ3−nχ1χ2···χn−1
3c/parenrightBig
,{JΛai}=J(0|0···0)ai,
wherec= 0whenn≥4, and the set {J,G}∪{ai,J(0|0···0)ai}freely generates Pas aC[∇]-algebra.
Then, for Dn:=J(0|0···0),Pis aN=nSUSY PVA with a N=nsuperconformal vector J.
Moreover, Pis freely generated by the set {J}∪{ai}i∈Ias aC[∇]-algebra, where {ai}i∈Iconsists
ofJ-primary elements.
Remark however that the application to N=nSUSYW-algebras remains to be done. We note
that superconformal algebras with nsupersymmetry have being deﬁned in physics in the 70’s [1],
in relation with the o(n) algebras. It has to be related with the principal embedding s ofosp(0|2)≃
sl(2),osp(1|2) andosp(2|2)≃sl(1|2) in Lie superalgebras for N= 0,1,2 SUSY respectively. In
view of these results, it is tempting to conjecture that N=nSUSYW-algebras shouldbe related to
osp(n|2) embeddings into superalgebras. However, the notion of pr incipal embeddings of osp(n|2),22 E. RAGOUCY, A. SONG, AND U.R. SUH
n >2 has to be precised. As a ﬁrst step, we remark that only the sup eralgebras osp(n|2) with
n= 1,2,3,4 admit aprincipal osp(1|2), sothat theselater cases appearto bemorenatural. Looki ng
forsl(1|2) principal embeddings, one is restricted to sl(n+1|n). Moreover we note that the osp(3|2)
superalgebra can be viewed as the folding of a sl(3|2) superalgebra, in the same way osp(1|2) can
be viewed as the folding of sl(1|2) [18]. Then, embeddings of sl(3|2) superalgebras in sl(n+1|n)
looks like the more promising direction to study N= 3 SUSY W-algebras. Yet, a detailed analysis
remains to be done.
We also observe that the Sugawara and Kac-Todorov construct ions recalled in Examples 3.16
and 3.17 are not fully understood at the level of N= 2 SUSY aﬃne VA or PVA. There was some
attempts in the physics literature [15,17,39], based on the so-called coset construction, or using
constrained N= 2 superﬁelds, but a comprehensive study is still needed.
Finally, wenotethat the N= 2SUSY W-algebraspresentedinthispapercorrespondtoprincipal
embeddingsof sl(1|2) into Liesuperalgebras. Infact, any embeddingof sl(1|2) should lead to N= 2
SUSYW-algebras, see [36]. A detailed analysis of this more genera l case will be the subject of a
future work [37].

A.1.Proof of Proposition 5.1.
A.1.1.Proof of (1) in Proposition 5.1. For such a purpose, let us compute [ ω(¯˜f)Λω(¯˜f)].
Lemma A.1. Fora=b=˜f∈gf
−1/2, the only nontrivial terms in (4.12)are−ω([a,b])and
(A.3) −/parenleftbig
k(b|v(0)

k(˜v1
(1)|v(1)
1)(D+χ)/parenrightbig/parenleftbig
k(˜v1
(2)|a)(D+χ)/parenrightbig
= 2k3λχ.
Proof.Let us show the only nonzero terms in [ ω(¯a)Λω(¯b)]+ω([a,b]) are given by (A.3). By relation
(4.12), we have v(m0)
i0∈g(j) forj=−1,−1
2,0,1
2.
(i) Letv(m0)
i0∈g(−1). Then ( b|v(m0)
i0) = 0. Since [ b,v(m0)
i0]∈g(−3
2), then [b,v(m0)
i0]♯∝\e}atio\slash= 0 implies
[˜f,v(m0)
i0]∈Cv0
3(see Lemma 2.3). This in turn shows that ˜ vit
(mt+1)∈/circleplustext
j≥3
2g(j) fort∈Z+,
so that (˜ vit
(mt+1)|a) = 0. From gf∩n=∅, we also have [˜ vit
(mt+1),a]♯= 0. Hence v(m0)
i0∈g(−1)
cannot give rise to nonzero terms.
(ii) Letv(m0)
i0∈g(−1
2). Then ( b|v(m0)
i0) = 0 and [ b,v(m0)
i0]♯∝\e}atio\slash= 0 implies v(m0)
i0∈C˜f. However, if
v(m0)
i0∈C˜fthen ˜vi0
(m0+1)= 0. Hence we cannot get any nonzero terms.
(iii) Let v(m0)
i0∈g(0). Then ( b|v(m0)
i0) = 0 and [ b,v(m0)
i0]♯∝\e}atio\slash= 0 implies v(m0)
i0∈CHandvi0
(m0+1)∈Ce.
In this case, [˜ vi0
(m0+1),g]♯= 0 for any g∈g, since [e,g]⊕gf= 0.
(iv) Let v(m0)
i0∈g(1
2). The only nonzero term arises only when v(m0)
i0∈C˜eandv(m1)
i1∈CU. In
this case we get relation (A.3).
/square
By Lemma A.1, we have {ω(¯˜f)Λω(¯˜f)}=−2ω(¯F)+2k3λχ. Hence we proved Proposition 5.1 (1).
A.1.2.Additionnal lemmas. To prove Proposition 5.1 (2), let us introduce some more lemm as. We
remind that I={1,2,···,2n+1}andJ={(i,m)|i∈ I, m= 0,1,···,di}.
Lemma A.2. Leti,j∈ Iand(j,t)∈ J. Then
(1)[˜vi
(2i),v(t)
j]♯= 0fort≤2j−1,
(2)[˜vi
(2i−1),v(t)
j]♯= 0fort≤2j−2.
Proof.For (1), observe that v(t)
jfort≤2j−1 is in [e,g]. Letu(t+1)
j∈gsatisfy [e,u(t+1)
j] =v(t)
j.
Since ˜vi
(2i)∈ge, we have [ e,[u(t+1)
j,˜vi
(2i)]] = [v(t)
j,˜vi
(2i)]∈[e,g].Hence, from [ e,g]∩gf=∅, we proved
(1).
For (2), let t≤2j−2. Observe there are u′(t+2)
j∈gand ˜ui
(2i)∈gesuch that v(t)
j= [E,u′(t+2)
j]
and ˜vi
(2i−1)= [f,˜ui
(2i)]. Now we have [˜ vi
(2i−1),v(t)
j]♯= [E,[[f,˜ui
(2i)],u′(t+2)
j]]♯+[[[f,˜ui
(2i)],E],u′(t+2)
j]♯.
Since [[f,˜ui
(2i)],E] = 0 and [ E,[[f,˜ui
(2i)],u′(t+2)
j]]♯= 0, we conclude [˜ vi
(2i−1),v(t)
j]♯= 0. /square
Now, we can list nonzero terms in relation (4.12) when b=˜forF. To lighten the notations, let
us denote
(A.4) /tildewideω([x,y]) :=ω([x,y]♯)−k(x|y)(χ+D).26 E. RAGOUCY, A. SONG, AND U.R. SUH
Lemma A.3. Letb=F. Fora=˜f, the bracket [ω(b)Λω(a)]can be computed similarly to what
has been done for (4.17). Ifa=F, the only nonzero terms in (4.12)can be listed as follows:
(A.5)/tildewideω([b,v(0)

2])/tildewideω([˜v2
(1),v(3)
2])/tildewideω([˜v2
(4),a]) =1
2k2(χ+D)ω(¯F)χ.
Proof.Use Lemma A.2 and track all the nonzero terms as in the proof of Lemma A.1. Essentially,
the computations done for relation (4.16) work. /square
By equation (4.17), and adding the contributions in relatio n (A.5), we get
(A.6){GΛω(˜f)}= (2∂+χD+2λ)ω(˜f)
{GΛG}= (2∂+χD+3λ)G−2kλ2χ
forG:=−2
k2ω(¯F). Hence ω(˜f) isG-primary of conformal weight 1.
Lemma A.4. Leti≥3be an integer. Then
(1)[˜e,v(4j)
2j] = 2jv(4j−2)
2j−1,
(2)[˜e,v(4j−2)
2j−1] =−(2j−1)v(4j−2)
2j.
Proof.We know [˜ e,v(4j)
2j] =cv(4j−2)
2j−1for a constant c∈C. Since [ ˜f,[˜e,v(4j)
2j]] =−[2H,v(4j)
2j] =
2jv(4j)
2jand [˜f,[˜e,v(4j)
2j]] =c[˜f,v(4j−2)
2j−1] =cv(4j)
2j, Hencec= 2jand (1) follows.
The proof for (2) is analogous to the one for (1) once one uses e quation (A.1). /square

(1) If/tildewidew([F,v(m)

For (3), Lemma A.2 shows /tildewidew([˜vi

Proof.Using Lemma A.5, one shows that the only non-zero terms in (4. 12) are given by (A.8). For
instance, one can show that there is no nonzero term starting with/tildewideω([b,v(2)

Since [˜v2

consider ( i′,m′) such that/tildewideω([˜vi

A.5 (5) tells that there is no nonzero term starting with /tildewideω([b,v(2)

(A.8) are obtained by direct computations. /square28 E. RAGOUCY, A. SONG, AND U.R. SUH

In order to compute [ ω(¯v(2i)

(4.12) when b=Fanda= ¯v(2i)
i(see Lemma A.12 and A.13). We ﬁrst use the following lemma
and corollaries (see Lemma A.9, Corollaries A.10 and A.11).
Lemma A.9. Letj∈Z+be an integer such that j≤n. We have the following properties:
(1)v(2j−1)

Proof.(1) Letxjbe the constant such that v(2j−1)
j=xj[e,v(2j)

[e,v(2j)

= (−1)jyj
j([e,f]|[v(2j)
j,˜vj
(2j)]) = (−1)jyj(v(2j)
j|˜vj
(2j)) = 1,
we have yj= (−1)j.
(3) Using the above relations (1), (2) and the Jacobi identit y, we have
(A.11)[˜vj

Combining the result of Lemma A.5 and Corollary A.10, we can n arrow down the number of

Proof.By Lemma A.5 and Corollary A.11, we can ﬁnd all possible nonze ro terms. For equalities
(A.14), we use Lemma A.9 (2). Since
[˜v2j
(4j−1),a]♯= ([[f,˜v2j
(4j)],a]|˜v2i−2j
(4i−4j))v(4i−4j)
2i−2j= (˜v2j
(4j)|[˜v2i−2j
(4i−4j−1),a])v(4i−4j)

we have
ω(¯v(4j)

The same proof works for equality (A.15). Hence the lemma fol lows. /square

Proof.We aim to show/summationtexti−1
j=2(A.16) = 0 and/summationtexti−1
j=2(A.17)+(A.18) = 0. The ﬁrst assertion follows
from the fact that

which can be deduced by a computation similar to the proof of ( A.14). For the second assertion,
we use equalities in (A.17) and (A.18). More precisely, obse rve that

Here, the ﬁrstequality in (A.20) corresponds to the ﬁrstequ ality in the formulas (A.17) and (A.18).
The second equality in (A.20) corresponds to the second equa lity of formulas (A.17) and (A.18).

A.3.Proof of Theorem 5.5. We use Theorem 3.9 and 3.10 to prove Theorem 5.5.
Lemma A.17. The following relations hold:
{ν(f)λν(f)}=−2ν(F)+1
2(ν(U))2−k2λ2,
{ν(˜f)λν(˜f)}= 2ν(F)−1

In the rest of this section, we show that J:=−√−1ν(U) is aN= 2 superconformal vector of
