L-FUNCTIONS UNDER SQUARE-ROOT CANCELLATION HYPOTHESES
ANNIKA MAURO, JACK B. MILLER, AND STEVEN J. MILLER
Abstract. The Katz-Sarnak philosophy predicts that the behavior of ze ros near the central point in
families of L-functions agrees with that of eigenvalues near 1 of random m atrix ensembles. Under GRH,
Iwaniec, Luo and Sarnak showed agreement in the one-level de nsities for cuspidal newforms with the
support of the Fourier transform of the test function in ( −2,2). They increased the support further under
a square-root cancellation conjecture, showing that a GL(1 ) estimate led to additional agreement between
number theory and random matrix theory. We formulate a two-d imensional analog and show it leads to
improvements in the two-level density. Speciﬁcally, we sho w that a square-root cancellation of certain
classical exponential sums over primes increases the suppo rt of the test functions such that the main terms
in the 1- and 2-level densities of cuspidal newforms average d over bounded weight k(and ﬁxed level 1)
converge to their random matrix theory predictions. We also conjecture a broad class of such exponential
sums where we expect improvement in the case of arbitrary n-level densities, and note that the arguments
in [ILS] yield larger support than claimed.

1.Introduction
1.1.Background. Since the observations of Montgomery and Dyson 50 years ago, random matrix theory
has provided a guide to predicting the behavior of quantitie s related to the zeros and values of L-functions;
we focus on the behavior of zeros here. Initially this agreem ent was limited to theoretical results on the
pair correlation of zeros of the Riemann zeta function, and t hen extended to include the n-level correlations
of automorphic forms and numerical results on the spacings b etween zeros; see [ Ga;Hej;Mon ;RS;
Od1;Od2]. These statistics concern the behavior high up on the criti cal line, and are thus insensitive to
ﬁnitely many zeros. In particular, they miss the eﬀects from zeros at the central point, which are of great
importance in a variety of number theory problems, from the B irch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture and

To remedy this, Katz and Sarnak [ KS1 ;KS2 ] introduced new statistics, the n-level densities; there
is now an extensive literature on agreement between number t heory and random matrix theory here;

connections between the two subjects.
This work is a continuation of the seminal paper [ ILS]; in brief, we extend their results for certain
one-level densities to two-level, and discuss how to genera lize to arbitrary n. Speciﬁcally, we show that a
natural generalization of their Hypothesis S on cancellati on in certain prime sums, which led to increasing
the support for the one-level density, leads to increased su pport where the 2-level density of certain families
of cuspidal newforms and random matrix theory agree. Such re sults have applications in bounding the
order of vanishing at the central point. We assume the reader is familiar with the basics of L-functions;
see for example [ IK] for details. The following deﬁnitions are standard; we par aphrase from [ LiM ] as we
will use their framework to convert our results on increased support to estimates on weighted order of
vanishing.
A function Φ : Rn→Ris Schwartz if it is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable and it and all of its derivatives
decay faster than any polynomial. In our setting, an even Sch wartz function Φ with compactly supported
Fourier transform is called a test function . We frequently assume the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis
(GRH) holds for each L(s,f), and write the non-trivial zeros of a cuspidal newform L(s,f) of levelN
and weight kby
ρ(j)
f=1
2+iγ(j)
f
forγ(j)
f∈Rincreasingly ordered and centered about zero.1The number of zeros with |γ(j)
f|bounded
by an absolute large constant is of order log cffor some constant cf>1; this is known as the analytic
conductor .
Deﬁnition 1.1 (n-Level Density) .Then-level density of an L-functionL(s,f)with respect to a test
function Φ :Rn→Rwith compactly supported Fourier transform is deﬁned as
Dn(f; Φ) :=/summationdisplay
j1,...,j n
ji/ne}ationslash=±jkΦ/parenleftbigglogcf
2πγ(j1)
f,...,logcf
2πγ(jn)
f/parenrightbigg
. (1.1)
Note that the existence of the n-level density does not depend on GRH.
One of the most important applications of the n-level density is to obtaining bounds on the order
of vanishing to a given order at the central point. For such re sults, we need Φ to be non-negative and
positive at the origin.
Unlike then-level correlations, the sum (1.1) is hard to study for an ind ividualfbecause by choice of
Φ it essentially captures only a bounded number of zeros. Thu s we study averages over ﬁnite subfamilies
F(Q) := {f∈ F :cf∈I(Q)}(which are parametrized by some quantity Qsuch that as Qtends to
inﬁnity, the size of the subfamily tends to inﬁnity as well), namely
E[Dn(f; Φ),Q] :=1
#F(Q)/summationdisplay
f∈F(Q)Dn(f; Φ). (1.2)
Common choices are I(Q) ={Q},{1,2,...,Q }and{Q,Q + 1,..., 2Q}.
The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture [ KS1 ;KS2 ] asserts that the n-level density of a family of L-
functions, in the limit as the conductors tend to inﬁnity, co nverges to the n-level density of eigenvalues
1In many of the calculations of Bessel-Kloosterman terms, we need GRH for Dirichlet L-functions. We can often avoid
GRH for cuspidal newforms at the expense of more involved cal culations, but if GRH fails while we can still formally calcu late
these statistics, as the zeros are no longer on the critical l ine we lose the correspondence with physics.EXTENDING SUPPORT FOR 1 AND 2-LEVEL DENSITIES UNDER CANCELL ATION HYPOTHESES 3
of a classical compact group as the matrix sizes tend to inﬁni ty. Explicitly, if Fis a “good” family of
L-functions and Φ is not zero at the origin, then there exists a distribution Wn,Fsuch that

We have the following expansions for the quantities above; t hough for computational purposes it is
often advantageous to use an alternative expansion due to Hu ghes-Miller [ HM], which writes the n-level
density as a sum of terms emerging as the support increases.
Theorem 1.2 (Determinant Expansion [ KS1 ]).LetK(x) =sinπx
πxandKǫ(x,y) =K(x−y) +ǫK(x+
y). Then the n-level densities have the following distinct closed form de terminant expansions for each
corresponding symmetry group:
Wn,SO(even)(x) = det (K1(xi,xj))i,j≤n, (1.4)
Wn,SO(odd)(x) = det (K−1(xi,xj))i,j,≤n+n/summationdisplay

Wn,U(x) = det (K0(xi,xj))i,j,≤n, (1.7)
Wn,Sp(x) = det (K−1(xi,xj))i,j,≤n. (1.8)
As remarked, one of the main applications of this statistic i s to bound the order of vanishing of a family
ofL-functions at the central point by choosing a test function w hich is non-negative and positive at the
origin, see [ BCDMZ ;DM;Fr;FrMil ;LiM ]. Many of these papers are concerned with trying to ﬁnd
the optimal test function for a given support, but already in the work of [ ILS] one sees that there may be
only a negligible improvement in bounds from using the optim al functions derived from Fredholm theory
over simple test functions. Thus, while there have been some recent advances in determining the optimal
function for a given support, it has been more productive to i ncrease the support and the level nstudied;
however, as nincreases while the bounds obtained are better for the perce ntage of forms vanishing to
order at least rwhenris large, they are worse for small r. Thus there is a balancing act, with most
of the eﬀort devoted to ﬁnding the largest support possible, and then given that determining the best
bounds by using easy to compute test functions for each n. We concentrate on increasing the support
for certain families of cusp forms, which can then be fed into the machinery from Dutta-Miller [ DuM ]
to yield improved estimates.
In [ILS], the authors introduce the following hypothesis, whose im plications are striking, allowing them
to break ( −2,2) for the support for certain families.
Hypothesis 1.3 (Hypothesis S) .Lete(z) :=e2πiz,cbe a positive integer and abe an arbitrary residue

1.2.Previous Work. The reason why [ ILS] is interested in this family of hypotheses is because they
increase the support of test functions for which the one-lev el density agrees with random matrix theory.
We ﬁrst review their result, and then discuss our generaliza tion.
For convenience, as is often done in the subject, we assume ou r test function Φ is the product of one-
dimensional test functions φi. Below we conﬁne our study to cusp forms of level 1 and weight k. Following
[ILS], one is able to get better results on the support by averagin g overk. This allows us to exploit some
oscillation in the Bessel function factors that emerge in ap plication of the Petersson formula. Note that
rather than sum over all forms equally, each form fof weightkis weighted by the slowly varying factor
1/L(1,sym2(f)) [HL;I2]. There is a trade-oﬀ in studying this modiﬁcation of the n-level densities; these4 ANNIKA MAURO, JACK B. MILLER, AND STEVEN J. MILLER
harmonic weights arise naturally in the Petersson formula, and their introduction simpliﬁes calculations
below. Unfortunately their presence means that we cannot ob tain results on bounding the order of
vanishing at the central point, but instead obtain results o n weighted vanishing. In many families these
weights can be removed through additional work; see [ ILS].
Deﬁnition 1.4 (Agrees with Orthogonal RMT) .We say that a test function Φ agrees with Orthogonal
Random Matrix Theory if

1, with normalization so that af(1) = 1 . TheL-functionL(s,f)has coeﬃcients λf(n):=af(n)n−(k−1)/2
so thatλf(p)∈[−2,2]and theL-functionL(s,f)is symmetric about Re(s) = 1/2.
Remark 1.5. For the family considered above, previous results show that the underlying symmetry group
is orthogonal, hence our comparison with the orthogonal beh avior. For other families we would just use
the corresponding densities from Theorem 1.2.
We are now able to state the following result from [ ILS], which extends the support for the family of
level 1 cusp forms to beyond ( −2,2).
Theorem 1.6 (One-level extended support) .Assume GRH. Then H1(α,A)implies that a test function
φagrees with random matrix theory if supp(/hatwideφ)⊂(−σ,σ)forσ= min {5/2,2 + (6 −8α)/(1 + 2A+ 4α)}.

1.3.New Results. In their manuscript from 2000, Iwaniec, Luo and Sarnak [ ILS] state and prove the
Theorem 1.6 for σ= 2 + (12 −16α)/(5 + 4A+ 8α), which is less than 2 + (6 −8α)(1 + 2A+ 4α); however,
a careful analysis of their arguments give more than what the y claimed. In Section 2, we give a proof
of Theorem 1.6 based on Section 10 of [ ILS], and discuss in Appendix A the diﬀerence in the claimed
support and what the calculation yields.
Our main theorem, Theorem 1.8, is a natural extension of Theo rem 1.6, showing that square-root
cancellation hypotheses also extend to the case of the 2-lev el density. For ease of exposition and to
highlight the issues, we focus on the n= 2 case, though similar calculations should hold in general .
Hypothesis 1.7. Lete(z) :=e2πiz,cbe a positive integer, and a1,a2be arbitrary residue classes mod c.
LetH2(α,A)denote a 2-parameter family of hypotheses, where α∈[1/2,3/4],A∈[0,∞), each of which
states that

holds uniformly over c>0and residue classes a1,a2modc.
It should be noted that hypothesis H2(α,A) impliesH1(α,A), because one may take x1orx2constant
to obtain a single sum over primes. A natural extension of The orem 1.6 is our main theorem, proven in
Section 3.
Theorem 1.8 (Two-level extended support) .Assume GRH. Then H2(α,A)implies that a test function

Using the machinery from [ DuM ] for an orthogonal ensemble with the naive test function we o btain

the strongest version of Hypothesis 1.7, we may take v1= 2.5andv2= 1.2. These values yield
P1(F)≤0.9000, P 2(F)≤0.4500, P 3(F)≤0.1200, P 4(F)≤0.0469, P 5(F)≤0.0248.
(1.16)
Remark 1.10. We quickly comment on the conditional nature of these result s. In [ ILS] there are two
places GRH is used. The ﬁrst is for convenience to bound certa in prime sums of cuspidal newforms, which
they remark can be bypassed by additional appeals to the Pete rsson formula (see the comments after their
equation (4.24)).2The second is when one splits by sign for square-free level Ntending to inﬁnity, GRH
is needed to analyze the main term contribution and size of th e error of the Bessel-Kloosterman term;
however, we only need this for Dirichlet L-functions. If we do not split by sign and consider level 1
cuspidal newforms for kup toK(appropriately weighted), then Hypothesis S, a “ GL1” exponential sum,
suﬃces.
Remark 1.11. We expect in the limit that 50% of the forms in our family shoul d be rank 0 and 50%
rank 1; thus (paraphrasing comments one of us heard from Iwan iec in graduate classes) for r≥2we may
interpret Theorem 1.9 as providing better upper bounds on 0.
We ﬁrst review the proof for the one-level density in §2 to ﬁx no tation and then extend to the two-level
in the next section. For notational convenience we prove The orem 1.8 in the case when φ1=φ2; a
similar argument holds in general (see for example the argum ents in [ LiM ], which extend the n-level
density results of [ HM] from identical test functions to the more general case). We then discuss further
generalizations to larger n.
2.The One-Level Case
We follow the arguments in [ ILS] to prove Theorem 1.6, but with extra care towards the step th at
derives their equation (10.17), since the expression in the ir original manuscript diﬀers slightly from our
estimation. This also sets the notation we need for our two-l evel result, as well as isolating certain
one-level results that are used again.
We begin by justifying normalizing the one-level density su m

2While we need GRH to have the zeros lie on the critical line, an d thus have a direct comparison to eigenvalues of Hermitian
matrices or energy levels of heavy nuclei, such an assumptio n is only needed for this interpretation or correspondence; the
n-level densities exist whether or not GRH holds.6 ANNIKA MAURO, JACK B. MILLER, AND STEVEN J. MILLER
we show that B(K) =/hatwideh(0)K+O(1), and thus either gives the same main terms as K→ ∞ . This follows
from a special case of the Petersson trace formula:

Careful estimation of the Petersson trace formula for speci al values as in Corollary 2.3 of [ ILS] gives
∆k(1,1) = 1 +O(2−k), and so our claim about B(K) follows by interpreting the main term H=/summationtext

as a Riemann sum of the function 2 h(x) divided by the mean spacing 2 /K, hence
H=/hatwideh(0)K+O(1) where the implied constant depends on h, e.g. using the fact that hhas bounded
derivative (though the weaker condition of hhaving bounded variation would suﬃce).

It is at this stage the goal of the analysis becomes clear: est imate P(φ) by extracting a main term
and bounding the error. In the case of the one-level density, the prime sum P(φ) does notcontribute
to the main term when supp(/hatwideφ)⊂(−σ,σ) for someσwe would like to determine, giving us agreement
with random matrix theory. For example, without the use of Hy pothesis 1.3, [ ILS] immediately show
using the Petersson trace formula and Weil’s estimate that B(p,1) =O(p1/2K−4), and so taking σ= 2
means that pruns up to P≪K4−δassuming supp(/hatwideφ)⊆[−2 +δ,2−δ] for some positive δ, which gives
P(φ)≪K−δ.
To increase σ, it is necessary to deal with a worse error term that cannot be absorbed into O(p1/2K−4)
whenσ > 2. Namely, by applying the Petersson formula to B(m,n) and approximating the Bessel
function sums using standard techniques (see Corollary 8.2 in [ILS] and then the top of page 86 in [ I1]),
one may derive the following.EXTENDING SUPPORT FOR 1 AND 2-LEVEL DENSITIES UNDER CANCELL ATION HYPOTHESES 7

We only sum over primitive residue classes mod c, each of which contains inﬁnitely many primes, whereas
the non-primitive classes consist of primes pdividingc. Because ℏis rapidly decaying, only large primes
p≫c2K4contribute, and so the non-primitive residue classes are ab sorbed into the Vinogradov notation.
We now perform summation by parts. For each sum over primes in a residue class, we put ψc(x) =

Thus we see a natural opportunity to use Hypothesis 1.3 in our estimate for the local factors arising from
the explicit formula applied to the weighted average of the o ne-level density D1(f;φ).8 ANNIKA MAURO, JACK B. MILLER, AND STEVEN J. MILLER

where the implied constant depends on φ. We treatψ′
c(x) asO(1) for small cand as rapidly decaying for
largec. The exact transition region for cis governed by the argument of the rapidly decaying function
ℏ, i.e.,cK2/√
P=θ(1). Thus, we truncate our sum over cin (2.13) at the value C=P1/2Kε−2. Indeed,
applying Weil’s estimate and equation (2.16) with ℏ′(x),ℏ(x) =OΩ(x−Ω) for Ω>0 large, we bound the
tail of (2.13) by

Thus we have a balancing act, where we let ε→0 whileO(1)−εΩ<0 to maximize the extension of
support obtained by this method. This shows that we may negle ct these terms for further computation,
i.e., they are absorbed into the Vinogradov notation.
Focusing now on the small values of c, we estimate ψ′
c(x) =Oh(Kεx−7/4) forx≥c2K4−2ε, handling
the smaller values of xusing rapid decay estimates similar to above. This gives

≪Pα+A/2+1/4K−2A−3+O(ε). (2.18)
We usually write O(ε) asε, as this can be done by changing our deﬁnition of ε. Thus, we have derived
P(φ)≪φ,h,εPK−4+Pα+A/2+1/4K−2A−3+ε. (2.19)
To understand an account of the various estimates for (2.19) , see Appendix A.
SinceP=K2σ′whereσ′=logP
2 log Ktends to the maximum of supp(/hatwideφ), and soσ′< σfor all large K.
Since we have agreement with random matrix theory only if P(φ) =o(K), each term in (2.19) gives us
an upper bound on our method for obtaining σin Theorem 1.6. Namely, PK−4=o(K) givesσ≤5/2,
andPα+A/2+1/4K−2A−3+εasε→0 givesσ≤2 + (6 −8α)/(1 + 2A+ 4α). This concludes our proof of
Theorem 1.6.
The best support we could expect would be using hypothesis H1(1
2,0), which gives an increased support
of supp(/hatwideφ)⊂(−5/2,5/2); see Appendix A for a history of this derivation. Notice th atσ= 5/2 can also
be achieved using H1with respect to any ( α,A) along the linear interpolation of (0 .5,0.5) and (0.55,0).
3.The Two-Level Case
The starting point is the explicit formula, and inclusion-e xclusion to express the two-level density in
terms of prime sums. The calculation is standard (see Sectio n B) and yields equation (B.7), which we
restate below (recall P(f;φ) is deﬁned in (2.9)):

From Section 2, we know that the averages of P(f;φ2) and P(f;φ) areo(K) when the support
supp(/hatwideφ)⊂(−/tildewideσ/2,/tildewideσ/2), where/tildewideσisσ(α,A) given in Theorem 1.6 and we assume hypothesis H1(α,A).EXTENDING SUPPORT FOR 1 AND 2-LEVEL DENSITIES UNDER CANCELL ATION HYPOTHESES 9

We now assume hypothesis H2(α,A), found in (1.12).
As was illustrated by estimates in Section 2, it suﬃces to onl y integrate over the region xy≥c2K4−2ε;
we may also truncate our sum at c≤C=PKε−2. Allowing this reduction along with Weil’s estimate
and∂2
xyψc(x,y) =O(Kε(xy)−7/4), we obtain

xy≥c2K4−2εcA(xy)α−7/4+εdxdy
≪P2K−4+P3/2+A+2αK−6−2A+O(ε). (3.10)
This gives an increased support of supp(/hatwideφ)⊂(−σ/2,σ/2) whereσ= 2 +6−8α
3+2A+4α.
This concludes our proof of Theorem 1.8, since equation (B.7 ) for the 2-level expansion yields the main
term /an}bracketle{tΦ,W2,O/an}bracketri}htplus an error term that is controlled by the family averages o fP(f;φ2) and P(nd)
2(φ).
Indeed, our main term is
2/integraldisplay∞
−∞|u|/hatwideφ(u)2du+/hatwideφ(0)2−3
4φ(0)2+/hatwideφ(0)φ(0)−2/hatwiderφ2(0), (3.11)
and it is a standard calculation (see [ HM;C–]) that this is equal to /an}bracketle{tΦ,W2,O/an}bracketri}ht(it is straightforward
combinatorics to pass between n-level densities and nthcentered moments).
By Hypotheses H1(α,A) andH2(α,A) the error does not contribute as K→ ∞ for
2σ≤min/braceleftbigg5

1 + 2A+ 4α,2 +6−8α
3 + 2A+ 4α/bracerightbigg
= 2 +6−8α
3 + 2A+ 4α. (3.12)
This is because the rest of the calculation for the two-level support consists of cross terms that already
appear in the one-level case, and these terms are negligible assumingH1(α,A) and 2σin the above range
by following the proof of Theorem 1.6 in Section 2.
4.Ann-Level Conjecture
Based on our calculations in Sections 2 and 3, we notice that t he fundamental sums arising from local
factors which may contribute have a predictable analysis. T he natural generalization of cancellation in
such sums lead to the following conjecture on extending supp ort.
Conjecture 4.1 (n-level Hypothesis) .Assume GRH. Let Φ :Rn→Rbe a test function given by
Φ(x) =/producttextn
i=1φ(xi). Assume the following square-root cancellation hypothesi s holds:

where the implied constant is uniform over cand the residue classes a1,...,a n. Then Φagrees with
random matrix theory whenever supp(/hatwideφ)⊂(−σ,σ), andσis given by
nσ= min/braceleftbigg5
2,2 +6−8α

= 2 +6−8α
2n−1 + 2A+ 4α. (4.2)EXTENDING SUPPORT FOR 1 AND 2-LEVEL DENSITIES UNDER CANCELL ATION HYPOTHESES 11
Expansions of the nthcentered moments or n-level densities have been calculated for related families
where we split by sign and let the level N→ ∞ through the primes; see [ C–] for families of such cuspidal
newforms, with the resulting agreement holding for supp(/hatwideφ)⊂(−2/n,2/n). A good future project3would
be to apply their combinatorial arguments in the level 1 sett ing, in particular seeing whether or not these
are the only terms that restricted the support to 2 /n.
Appendix A.Theorem 1.6 in the Literature
We provide some brief remarks on the support improvements fr om Hypothesis S.
Let us suppose that α= 1/2 andA= 0 for hypothesis H1(α,A), i.e., the exponential sums satisfy
true square-cancellation. Theorem 1.6 says that we may take σ= 5/2. In their 1999 pre-print, Iwaniec,
Luo and Sarnak perform the correct integration by parts tech nique, but their estimate of a sum of Bessel
functions is non-sharp; they write
/summationdisplay
keven2h/parenleftbiggk−1
K/parenrightbigg
ikJk−1(x) = Main Term + Oh/parenleftBigg
x
K4+x2
K6/parenrightBigg
, (A.1)
see Proposition 1 of Section 2 in their paper. It is this extra error ofOh(x/K6) that aﬀects the ﬁnal
result, giving σ= 7/3 instead of σ= 5/2. In their 2000 publication, the error term in (A.1) is corre cted to
Oh(x/K4), which leads to the correct estimate in Corollary 8.2 of [ ILS]. However, [ ILS] derivesσ= 22/9
instead ofσ= 5/2; this is because although their Bessel sum estimate is corr ect, they derive
P(φ)≪φ,h,εPK−4+Pα+A/2+5/8K−2A−9/2+ε. (A.2)
It is unclear how they did this; following their integration by parts technique in the 1999 preprint, it
seems that with the correction to (A.1) found in their 2000 pu blication, they would have derived equation
(2.19) as we present it today.
Appendix B.Explicit Formulae For The Densities
We order the zeros of L(s,f) by 0 ≤γ(1)≤γ(2)≤ · · · including multiplicity, and γ(−j)=−γ(j), giving
us a zeroγ(j)for eachj∈Z− {0}. We recall the one-level density of L(s,f) with respect to a test
functionφto be
D1(f;φ):=/summationdisplay
j/ne}ationslash=0φ/parenleftbigglogcf
2πγ(j)/parenrightbigg
, (B.1)
wherecf=k2Nis the analytic conductor of a form fwith weight kand levelN. Throughout this paper,
we exclusively deal with level 1 modular forms, so log cf= 2 logkforf∈Hk.
Similarly, the two-level density with respect to a one-dime nsional test function φ:R→R(so
Φ(x1,x2) =φ(x1)φ(x2)) is
D2(f;φ):=/summationdisplay
j,ℓ/ne}ationslash=0
j/ne}ationslash=±ℓφ/parenleftbigglogcf
2πγ(j)/parenrightbigg
φ/parenleftbigglogcf
2πγ(ℓ)/parenrightbigg
. (B.2)
Straightforward inclusion-exclusion yields that this two -level density simpliﬁes as
D2(f;φ) =D1(f;φ)2−2D1(f;φ2), (B.3)
with similar expansions for the n-level densities as a degree npolynomial expression in terms of the
one-level densities of powers of φ.
In Section 4 of [ ILS], they derive the following expansion.
3It is likely that this will be investigated in the 2023 SMALL R EU.12 ANNIKA MAURO, JACK B. MILLER, AND STEVEN J. MILLER

above is a small error of size O/parenleftBiglog log kN

which depends on φ, and very crucially does not depend on f
(cf. equation (4.23) of [ ILS]). They also remark that one can achieve a similar error size on average via
unconditional means, which is described in Appendix B of [ ILS]. Thus, assuming GRH, we have

We drop the parameter Rfrom the notation of P(f;φ), since we often take Ras the analytic conductor
cf=k2Nor the average conductor over the family, i.e., R≍K2N.
We now consider the two-level density for φ. By applying (B.5) to (B.3) with f∈Hk=H⋆

R≍K2, we obtain

As we observe in Section 3, the only prime sum which contribut es to random matrix theory agreement
isP(f;φ)2: the terms involving P(f;φ2) and P(f;φ) become negligible under the support conditions for
Φ(x) =φ2(x1)φ2(x2) given by Theorem 1.6 assuming Hypothesis 1.3.
