APPLICATIONS TO HYPERSURFACES
JEFFREY S. CASE AND AARON J. TYRRELL
Abstract. We derive a sharp inequality relating the second and fourth e l-
ementary symmetric functions of the eigenvalues of a trace- free matrix and
give two applications. First, we give a new proof of the class iﬁcation of con-
formally ﬂat hypersurfaces in spaceforms. Second, we const ruct a functional
which characterizes rotational hypersurfaces and catenoi ds.
1.Introduction
Leti:Nn→(Mn+1,g),n≥4, be an immersed hypersurface in a locally confor-
mally ﬂat Riemannian manifold. This note is motivated by two interesting rigidity
results for Nin terms of its principal curvatures. First, Nishikawa and Maeda
showed [5] that ( Nn,i∗g) is locally conformally ﬂat if and only if at each point
it has a principal curvature of multiplicity at least n−1. Second, do Carmo and
Dajczer showed[1] that, under the strongerassumption that ( Mn+1,g) is complete,
simply connected, and of constant sectional curvature c∈R, the hypersurface Nis
contained in a so-called rotation hypersurface [1, Deﬁnition 2.2] if a t each point it
has a principal curvature of multiplicity exactly n−1. Furthermore, if Nis mini-
mal, then it is contained in a catenoid if and only if at each point it has a pr incipal
curvature of multiplicity at least n−1.
The purpose of this short note is to point out that the condition on t he principal
curvatures can be recast in terms of a sharp inequality relating the squared-norm
|˚A2|2of the square of the trace-free part of the second fundamenta l form˚Aand
the square of the squared-norm |˚A|2of˚A. Our main result is a purely algebraic
statement about trace-free linear maps on ﬁnite-dimensional vec tor spaces:
Theorem 1.1. LetVbe ann-dimensional inner product space, n≥4, and let
˚A∈End(V)be trace-free. Then
|˚A2|2≤n2−3n+3
n(n−1)|˚A|4
with equality if and only if ˚Ahas an eigenspace of dimension at least n−1.
The main idea of the proof of Theorem 1.1 is that the Newton inequality relating
the ﬁrst, second, and third elementary symmetric functions of th e eigenvalues of
a matrix Arealizes equality if and only if Ais proportional to the identity or has
rank 1. Applying this to ˚A+λIforIthe identity map yields the sharp inequality

for any trace-free ˚A∈End(Vn); this is sometimes called the λ-method [4]. Repeat-
ing this argument for the Newton inequality relating the second, thir d, and fourth
elementary symmetric functions yields Theorem 1.1.
We conclude with a number of applications of Theorem 1.1 to the rigidity of
locally conformally ﬂat hypersurfaces, of rotation hypersurface s, and of catenoids.
Our ﬁrst application is a new proof of the characterization [5] of loca lly con-
formally ﬂat hypersurfaces in locally conformally ﬂat manifolds in term s of their
principal curvatures.
Corollary 1.2. Leti:Nn→(Mn+1,g),n≥4, be an immersed hypersurface
in a locally conformally ﬂat manifold. The induced metric i∗gonNis locally
conformally ﬂat if and only if for each p∈N, the shape operator Ap:TpN→TpN
has an eigenspace of dimension at least n−1.
Our second application is a rigidity result for catenoids in simply connec ted
spaceforms amongst all minimial hypersurfaces.
Corollary 1.3. Leti:Nn→Mn+1(c),n≥4, be a minimal hypersurface in
the complete, simply connected Riemannian (n+1)-manifold of constant sectional
curvature c∈R. Then the shape operator A:TN→TNsatisﬁes
(1.1) |A2|2≤n2−3n+3
n(n−1)|A|4.
Moreover, equality holds if and only if i(N)is contained in a catenoid.
The above results motivate the introduction of two energy functio nals for hyper-
surfaces of a Riemannian manifold. First, given an immersion i:Nn→(Mn+1,g),
we deﬁne the rotational energy ofNby
Erot[N] :=/integraldisplay
N/parenleftbiggn2−3n+3
n(n−1)|˚A|4−|˚A2|2/parenrightbigg
dA,
assuming it is ﬁnite. Our terminology is motivated by the characteriza tion [1] of
rotation hypersurfaces in simply connected spaceforms.
Corollary 1.4. Leti:Nn→Mn+1(c),n≥4, be a nowhere umbilic immersed
hypersurface in the complete, simply connected, Riemannia n(n+ 1)-manifold of
constant sectional curvature c∈R. ThenErot[N]≥0with equality if and only if
Nis contained in a rotation hypersurface.
This result is sharper for minimal immersions.
Corollary 1.5. Leti:Nn→Mn+1(c),n≥4, be a minimal immersed hypersur-
face in the complete, simply connected, Riemannian (n+ 1)-manifold of constant
sectional curvature c∈R. Then Erot[N]≥0with equality if and only if Nis
contained in a catenoid.
Second, given an immersion i:Nn→(Mn+1,g), we deﬁne the conformal rota-
tional energy ofNby
Econf
rot[N] :=/integraldisplay
N|˚A|n−4/parenleftbiggn2−3n+3
n(n−1)|˚A|4−|˚A2|2/parenrightbigg
dA,
assuming it is ﬁnite. Note that Econf
rot=Erotfor four-dimensional hypersurfaces.
The main point is ofthis deﬁnition is that Econf
rotis conformallyinvariant, andhenceA RIGIDITY RESULT FOR CATENOIDS 3
gives a conformally invariant characterization of immersed submanif olds for which
the shape operator has an eigenspace of dimension at least n−1.
Corollary 1.6. Leti:Nn→(Mn+1,g),n≥4, be an immersed hypersurface in
a Riemannian manifold. Then Econf
rot[N]≥0with equality if and only if for each
p∈N, the shape operator Ap:TpN→TpNhas an eigenspace of dimension at least
n−1.
This note is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give an elementary pr oof of
Theorem 1.1. In Section 3 we prove our geometric applications of The orem 1.1.
2.Elementary symmetric functions
LetA∈End(Vn) be a linear map on an n-dimensional vector space. Denote by
(2.1) σk(A) :=/summationdisplay
i1<···<ikλi1···λik
thek-th elementary symmetric function of the eigenvalues {λ1,...,λ n}ofA, with
the convention σ0(A) = 1. Note that σ1(A) = trA. Deﬁne pk(A),k≤n, by
σk(A) =/parenleftbiggn
k/parenrightbigg
pk(A);
this renormalization is such that pk(λI) =λk, whereIis the identity map. The
main tool in the proof of Theorem 1.1 is the sharp version of Newton’s inequalities:
Lemma 2.1 ([6, Section 2]) .LetA∈End(Vn)and letk≤n−1be a positive
integer. Then
p2
k(A)≥pk−1(A)pk+1(A)
with equality if and only if Ais proportional to the identity or dimkerA≥n−k+1.
Applying the λ-method to Lemma 2.1 with k= 2 and k= 3 yields useful
inequalities,thesecondofwhichisrecordedinTheorem1.1. Werecor dtheresulting
inequalities separately due to their diﬀerent dependence on n= dimV.
Our ﬁrst inequality relates p2(˚A) andp3(˚A) for a trace-free linear map ˚Aon a
vector space of dimension at least 3.
Proposition 2.2. Let˚A∈End(Vn),n≥3, be such that p1(˚A) = 0. Then
p2
3(˚A)+4p3
2(˚A)≤0.
Moreover, equality holds if and only if ˚Ahas an eigenspace of dimension at least
n−1.
Proof.It is well-known, and follows easily from Equation (2.1), that
(2.2) pk(A+λI) =k/summationdisplay
j=0/parenleftbiggk

λjpk−j(A)
for allA∈End(Vn) and all λ∈R.
Nowlet˚A∈End(Vn)besuchthat p1(˚A) = 0. Lemma2.1impliesthat p2(˚A)≤0
with equality if and only if ˚A= 0. Since the conclusion is trivially true if ˚A= 0,
we may assume that p2(˚A)<0. For notational simplicity, denote pk:=pk(˚A).4 JEFFREY S. CASE AND AARON J. TYRRELL
Letλ∈R. Applying Lemma 2.1 to ˚A+λIand simplifying via Equation (2.2)
yields
0≤(p2+λ2)2−λ(p3+3λp2+λ3)
=p2
2−λp3−λ2p2,(2.3)
with equality if and only if ˚Ahas an eigenspace of dimension at least n−1. In fact,
sincep1= 0 and p2<0, the dimension must equal n−1 in the case of equality in
Inequality (2.3). Multiplying Inequality (2.3) by 4 p2<0 yields
0≥4p3

Therefore p2

n−1. /square
Our second inequality relates p2(˚A) andp4(˚A) for a trace-free linear map ˚Aon
a vector space of dimension at least 4.
Proposition 2.3. Let˚A∈End(Vn),n≥4, be such that p1(˚A) = 0. Then
p4(˚A)+3p2
2(˚A)≥0.
Moreover, equality holds if and only if ˚Ahas an eigenspace of dimension at least
n−1.
Proof.Let˚A∈End(Vn) be such that p1(˚A) = 0. For notational simplicity, denote
pk:=pk(˚A). Lemma 2.1 implies that p2(˚A)≤0 with equality if and only if ˚A= 0.
Since the conclusion is trivially true if ˚A= 0, we may assume that p2<0.
Now, applying Lemma 2.1 and Equation (2.2) to ˚A+λIyields
0≤(p3+3λp2+λ3)2−(p2+λ2)(p4+4λp3+6λ2p2+λ4)
=p2
3−p2p4+2λp2p3+λ2(3p2
2−p4)−2λ3p3−λ4p2
for allλ∈R. Multiplying by 16 p3

0≥16p3

Settings= 0 yields
(2.4) (3 p2
3−4p2p4)(p2
3+4p3

Proposition 2.2 implies that p2
3+ 4p3
2≤0 with equality if and only if, up to a
multiplicative constant and a choice of basis,
˚A=

Ifp2
3+4p3
2= 0, then a straightforward computation yields pk= 1−kfor allk∈N,
and hence p4+3p2
2= 0. If instead p2
3+4p3
2<0, then Inequality (2.4) implies that
3p2
3−4p2p4≥0. Therefore
0≤3p2

Sincep2<0, we conclude that p4+3p2
2>0. /square
Expressing the nonnegative quantity p4+3p2
2in terms of |A|4and|A2|2yields
Theorem 1.1.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let˚A∈End(Vn) be such that p1(˚A) = 0. Direct computa-
tion gives
σ2(˚A) =−1
2|˚A|2,
σ4(˚A) =1

Therefore

The conclusion readily follows from Proposition 2.3. /square
3.Geometric applications
We conclude by proving our geometric applications of Theorem 1.1.
Proof of Corollary 1.2. Leti:Nn→(Mn+1,g) be a Riemannian immersion into a
locally conformally ﬂat manifold. Denote by Wthe Weyl tensor of i∗g. Denote by
F:=1
n−2/parenleftig
˚A2−Gi∗g/parenrightig
the Fialkow tensor F∈Γ(S2T∗N), where G:= tri∗gF=1
2(n−1)|˚A|2is its trace
(cf. [2, Equation (13.9)]). The Gauss–Codazzi equations (cf. [2, E quation (22.13)])
imply that
W=1
2˚A∧˚A+F∧g,
whereS∧Tdenotes the Kulkarni–Nomizu product
(S∧T)abcd:=SacTbd+SbdTac−SadTbc−SbcTad.
Direct computation gives (cf. [3])
|˚A∧˚A|2= 8|˚A|4−8|˚A2|2,
/an}bracketle{t˚A∧˚A,F∧g/an}bracketri}ht=−8/an}bracketle{t˚A2,F/an}bracketri}ht,
|F∧g|2= 4/an}bracketle{t˚A2,F/an}bracketri}ht,
/an}bracketle{t˚A2,F/an}bracketri}ht=1
n−2|˚A2|2−1
2(n−1)(n−2)|˚A|4.
Therefore
|W|2=2(n2−3n+3)
(n−1)(n−2)|˚A|4−2n
n−2|˚A2|2.
The conclusion readily follows from Theorem 1.1. /square
Proof of Corollary 1.3. Leti:Nn→Mn+1(c) be a minimal hypersurface. By min-
imality, the shape operator is trace-free; i.e. A=˚A. Theorem 1.1 implies that A
satisﬁes Inequality (1.1) with equality if and only if Ahas an eigenvalue of multi-
plicity at least n−1. The ﬁnal conclusion follows from a result [1, Corollary 4.4]
of do Carmo and Dajczer. /square6 JEFFREY S. CASE AND AARON J. TYRRELL
Proof of Corollary 1.4. Leti:Nn→Mn+1(c) be a nowhere umbilic immersed hy-
persurface. Theorem 1.1 implies that Erot[N]≥0 with equality if and only if at
each point p∈Mthe shape operator Aphas an eigenspace of dimension exactly
n−1. The ﬁnal conclusion follows from a result [1, Theorem 4.2] of do Ca rmo and
Dajczer. /square
Proof of Corollary 1.5. Leti:Nn→Mn+1(c) be a minimal immersed hypersur-
face. Corollary 1.3 implies that Erot[N]≥0 with equality if and only if i(N) is
contained in a catenoid. /square
Proof of Corollary 1.6. Leti:Nn→(Mn+1,g)beanimmersedhypersurface. The-
orem 1.1 implies that Econf
rot[N]≥0 with equality if and only if
|˚A|n−4/parenleftbiggn2−3n+3
n(n−1)|˚A|4−|˚A2|2/parenrightbigg
= 0.
It follows that for each p∈N, either˚Ap= 0 or
|˚A2
p|2=n2−3n+3
n(n−1)|˚Ap|4.
In the former case, ˚Aphas an eigenspace of dimension n. In the latter case, Theo-
rem 1.1 implies that ˚Aphas an eigenspace of dimension at least n−1. /square
