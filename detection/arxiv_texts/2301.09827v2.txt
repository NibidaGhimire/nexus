Abstract. We construct a multiplicative spectral sequence convergin g to the
cohomology algebra of the diagonal complex of a bisimplicia l set with coef-
ﬁcients in a ﬁeld. The construction provides a spectral sequ ence converging
to the cohomology algebra of the classifying space of a categ ory internal to
the category of topological spaces. By applying the machine ry to a Borel con-
struction, we explicitly determine the mod pcohomology algebra of the free
loop space of the real projective space for each odd prime p. This example
is emphasized as an important computational case. Moreover , we represent
generators in the singular de Rham cohomology algebra of the diﬀeological
free loop space of a non-simply connected manifold Mwith diﬀerential forms
on the universal cover of Mvia Chen’s iterated integral map.
1.Introduction
Astackis a generalization of a sheaf. More precisely, it is a weak 2-functor f rom
a site to the category of groupoids which satisﬁes the gluing conditio ns on objects
and morphisms. In particular, diﬀerentiable and topological stacks are obtained
by Lie and topological groupoids, respectively, via the stakiﬁcation s of prestacks
associated with such groupoids; see [5, Section 2], [20] and [6, Chapt er 1] for more
details. In [39], loop stacks are investigated by using diﬀeological gro upoids; see
[22] and Appendix B for diﬀeological spaces. It is worthwhile mentionin g that the
study of orbifolds is developed with those Lie groupoid presentations; see [1, 35].
In [4], Behrend introduced the de Rham cohomology and the singular h omology
for a diﬀerentiable stack, which are those of the classifying space o f a Lie groupoid
presentingthe stack. In particular, the cohomologyis invariantun derMoritaequiv-
alence. Thus, such results on stacks and groupoids motivate us to consider how to
compute the cohomology of such a classifying space; see Remark 3.3 .
This manuscript aims to introduce multiplicative spectral sequences computing
the cohomology algebras of the classifying spaces of topological ca tegories with
coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld K; see Theorems 2.1 and 2.2. Although there is no application
for a stack in this study, the product structure demonstrates it s power in giving
more additional structure to the spectral sequence and in the co mputations of the
cohomology algebras of non-simply connected spaces. To be more p recise, letLX
denote the free loop space of a space X,BGthe classifyingspace ofa ﬁnite group G
andEG×GMthe Borel construction of a G-spaceM. Then, Remark 5.11 enables
one to obtain a multiplicative spectral sequence endowed with an H∗(LBG;K)-
module structure converging to the cohomology algebra of L(EG×GM). We also

which provides a method for computing the Borel cohomologyalgebr aof aG-space.
As a computational example, we explicitly determine the cohomology a lgebra
of the free loop space of the real projective space with coeﬃcient s inZ/pandQ,
wherepis an odd prime; see Theorem 4.1. To our knowledge, this result is nove l.
Despite the lack of nontrivial information in the rational cohomology of the even-
dimensional projective space, the cohomology algebra of the free loop space can be
beneﬁcial.
Adiﬀeological space is a generalization of a manifold. Therefore, it is crucial to
consider smooth (homotopy) invariants of the generalized object s. In particular,
the de Rham complex and its singularvariant of a diﬀeological space ar e introduced
in [43] and [29], respectively. In this manuscript, we moreover attem pt to represent
generators in the singular de Rham cohomology of the free loop spac e of a non-
simplyconnectedmanifold Mbyusingdiﬀerentialformsontheuniversalcoverof M
withintheframeworkof diﬀeology ; seeTheorem6.1andsubsequentcomments. Asa
consequence, because of Theorem 4.1, we can describe generato rs of the singular de
Rham cohomology algebra of the diﬀeological free loop space of n-dimensional real
projectivespace with the volume form on the sphere Snvia Chen’s iterated integral
map; see Theorem 6.4. While the original iterated integrals due to Che n work
well for the cohomology of the free loop space of a simply connected manifold, the
diﬀeologicalargumentaboveshowsthatwecanalsodealwith non-s implyconnected
manifolds in Chen’s theory for free loop spaces. That is an advantag eof considering
manifolds in diﬀeology.
An outline of this manuscript is as follows. Section 2 introduces a spec tral se-
quence with a multiplicative structure for a bisimplicial set. The spect ral sequence
gives rise to those for topological categories, Borel constructio ns, and diﬀeological
categories. In Section 3, we establish Theorems 2.1 and 2.2. Section 4 describes the
computational example mentioned above. In Section 5, by generaliz ing the com-
putations in Section 4, we present results of the cohomology algebr as of Borel con-
structions. Moreover, we consider spectral sequences for tra nsformation groupoids
including an inertia groupoid. In Section 6, we investigate the singular de Rham
cohomology of the diﬀeological free loop space of a non-simply conne cted manifold
by applying results concerning Borel constructions in Section 5.
Appendix A gives a weak homotopy equivalence between a Borel cons truction
and the free loop space of a quotient space, which is used in the comp utation
in Section 4. In Appendix B, we brieﬂy recall the category of diﬀeolog ical spaces
togetherwithadjointfunctorsbetweenthecategoryoftopolog icalspaces. Appendix
C proves that the diﬀeological free loop space of smooth maps from S1is weak
homotopy equivalent to the pullback of the evaluation map from a pat h space
along the diagonal map in the category of diﬀeological spaces. This r esult is critical
for proving Theorem 6.1.
2.A multiplicative spectral sequence for a bisimplicial set a nd its
variants
We introduce multiplicative spectral sequences associated with a bis implicial set
by explicitly describing the product structure.
For asimplicial set K, wedenote by C∗(K;K) andH∗(K;K) the cochainalgebra
and the cohomology algebra of Kwith coeﬃcients in a ﬁeld K, respectively. LetON MULTIPLICATIVE SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR NERVES 3
Sing•(X) be the singular simplicial set of a space X. We may write H∗
sing(X;K) or
simplyH∗(X;K) for the singular cohomology algebra H∗(Sing•(X);K).
LetS=S••be a bisimplicial set. Then, the vertical face maps give rise to a
diﬀerential ( dv)∗by the alternating sum on the graded algebra Cp,∗:=C∗(Sp•;K)
with the usual cup product ∪for anyp≥0. Moreover, we have a double complex
{{Cp,q}p,q≥0,(dh)∗,(dv)∗}, where the diﬀerential ( dh)∗is induced by the horizontal
face maps of the bisimplicial set S••. A product ∪Ton the total complex Tot C∗,∗
is deﬁned by
ω∪Tη= (−1)qp′(dh
p+1···dh
p+p′)∗ω∪(dh
0···dh
p−1)∗η (2.1)
forω∈Cp,qandη∈Cp′,q′. Observe that the diﬀerential on Tot C∗,∗is given by
δ(ω) = (dh)∗(ω)+(−1)p(dv)∗(ω) forω∈Cp,q. Thus, we obtain a spectral sequence
{E∗,∗
r,dr}associated with the total complex.
Theorem 2.1. The ﬁrst quadrant spectral sequence {E∗,∗
r,dr}with the multiplica-
tive structure deﬁned by (2.1) converges to H∗(diagS••;K)as an algebra with
E∗,∗
2∼=H∗(H∗(S••,(dv)∗),(dh)∗)
as a bigraded algebra, where diagS••denotes the diagonal simplicial set of S••;
see, for example, [18, Chapter IV, 1] . Therefore, for a simplicial space X•=
{Xn,∂i,sj}, one has a ﬁrst quadrant spectral sequence converging to the singular
cohomology algebra H∗
sing(||X•||;K)withE∗,∗
2∼=H∗/parenleftbig
H∗
sing(X•,K),/summationtext
i(−1)i∂∗
i/parenrightbig
as
a bigraded algebra, where || ||denotes the fat geometric realization in the sense of
Segal[40].
A prototype of the spectral sequence in Theorem 2.1 is one stated in [34, II
6.8. Corollary]; see also [40, Proposition (5.1)] for a generalized coh omology. The
novelty here is that we explicitly provide an algebraic structure in the spectral
sequence.
LetC= [C1t/d47/d47s/d47/d47C0] be a category internal to Topthe category of topological
spaces; that is, structure maps containing the source map sand the target map
tare continuous. We may drop the maps sandtin the notation of an internal
category. The nerve functor gives rise to a cosimplicial cohain comp lex
n/mapsto→C∗(NervenC,K)
and then this induces a cosimplicial abelian group n/mapsto→Hq(NervenC,K) for any
q. In what follows, for a cosimplicial abelian group A•, we denote by H∆(A•) the
cohomology of A•. Let BCbe the classifying space, namely, B C=||Nerve•C||,
which is the fat geometric realization of the simplicial space Nerve •C; see [40]. The
multiplicative spectral sequence in Theorem 2.1 is adaptable to many s ituations.
The following results illustrate it with crucial examples.
Theorem2.2. (cf. [4], [34, II 6.8.Corollary, IV 4.1.Theorem], [17, Corollary 3.10])
i)LetC= [C1 /d47/d47/d47/d47C0]be a category internal to Top. Then there exists a spectral

Ep,q
2∼=Hp
∆(Hq(Nerve •C;K)).
ii)LetGbe a topological group and XaG-space. Then there exists a spectral
sequence converging to the Borel cohomology H∗

2∼=Hp(Hq(Nerve •G;K)).HereG:= [G×X /d47/d47/d47/d47X]denotes the
transformation groupoid associated to the G-spaceXwhose source map and target
map are the projection on the ﬁrst factor and the action of GonX, respectively.
In particular, one has an isomorphism

providedH∗(G)andH∗(X)are locally ﬁnite; see Remark 5.11 for a more structure
of the spectral sequence in the case where Gis a ﬁnite group.
iii)LetC= [C1 /d47/d47/d47/d47C0]be a category internal to the category Diﬀof diﬀeo-
logical spaces; that is, the sets C0andC1of objects and morphisms are diﬀeolog-
ical spaces, respectively, and structure maps in Care smooth; see Section B. Let
A∗
DR(SD
•(Nerve •(C)))denote the cosimplicial de Rham complex of the nerve of C
introduced in [29,§2]; see Remark 3.2 and Appendix B. Then, there exists a spectral
sequence converging to H∗(diagSD
•(Nerve •(C));R)as an algebra with
Ep,q
2∼=Hp
∆(Hq
DR(Nerve •(C))).
HereH∗
DR(Nerve •(C))denotes the cohomology of the complex A∗
DR(SD
•(Nerve •(C))).
One might expect that the target of the spectral sequence in The orem 2.2 iii) is
replaced with the cohomology of a more familiar object. We discuss th e topic in
Remarks 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.
Remark 2.3.LetCbe a category internal to Top. Then, by using the polynomial
de Rham functor APL(see, for example, [15, II 10 (a), (b) and (c)] and Appendix
B.1) instead of the singular cochain functor in Theorem 2.2 i), we have a spectral
sequence converging to the rational cohomology of B C. In this case, an appropriate
Sullivan model for each Nerve nCmay be useful when computing the E2-term as
an algebra; see, for example, [15, Part II] for Sullivan models. Obse rve that the
product∧TonAPL(Nerve •C) is of the form
ω∧Tη= (−1)qp′π∗
1ω∧π∗
2η (2.2)
forω∈Aq
PL(NervepC) andη∈Aq′
PL(Nervep′C), whereπ1andπ2aremaps assigning
(f1,...,fp) and (fp+1,...,fp+p′) to (f1,...,fp,fp+1,...,fp+p′), respectively; see
[4, (6)].
The spectral sequences in Theorem 2.2 i) and ii) are variants of that in Theorem
2.1. Therefore, each of them converges to the cohomology of the total complex
TotC∗(Nerve •(C);K) as an algebra. The spectral sequence described in Theorem
2.2 iii) is also constructed by applying Theorem 2.1. Then, it converges to the
cohomology algebra of the total complex Tot A∗
DR(SD
•(Nerve •(C))) with the same
product ∧Tas in (2.2). These targets of the convergences are isomorphic to t he
cohomology algebras described in Theorem 2.2. This follows from the p roof of
Theorem 2.2. Thus, it may be possible to reconstruct the algebra st ructure of the
target from that of the E∞-term in the same way as in [30, Section 7] with the
formula of the product; that is, we may solve extension problems in t he spectral
sequences in Theorem 2.2.
Moreover, the formulae (2.1) and (2.2) enable us to explicitly conside r the mul-
tiplication on the E2-term of the spectral sequence; see the proof of Proposition 4.4
in which the cohomology algebra of the free loop space of a Borel con struction is
investigated for low degrees.ON MULTIPLICATIVE SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR NERVES 5
The spectral sequence in [17, Corollary 3.10] converging to the hom ology of the
Borelconstruction EG×GMfor aG-spaceMhas a diﬀerential coalgebrastructure,
and the condition on local ﬁniteness for the homology groups H∗(G) andH∗(M) is
notrequired in constructing the spectral sequence. Indeed, the to rsion product of
chaincomplexes is used in the construction. In contrast, in proving Theorem 2.2ii),
we considerthe nerveofa categoryinternalto Topand apply the K¨ unneth theorem.
Then, the local ﬁniteness for cohomology groups H∗(G) andH∗(X) is required in
our theorem. We stress that the multiplicative structure in our spe ctral sequence
is given explicitly by (2.1) without an argument on dualizing the homology .
3.Constructions of the spectral sequences
The goal of this section is to construct the spectral sequences d escribed in The-
orems 2.1 and 2.2.
Proof of Theorem 2.1. We observe that the decreasing ﬁltration {FpTotC∗,∗}p≥0
deﬁned by ( FpTotC∗,∗)n=/circleplustext
i+j=n,i≥pCi,jprovides the spectral sequence. Since
the product ∪Tin (2.1) preservesthe ﬁltration, it induces a multiplicative structure
in the spectral sequence. Thus, for proving the ﬁrst assertion, it suﬃces to show
thattheproductin H∗(TotC∗,∗)givenby ∪Tiscompatiblewiththecupproducton
H∗(diagS••;K)underanappropriateisomorphismbetweenthecohomologygroup s.
To this end, we use an argument with universal δ-functors; see [45, Chapter 2].
The simplicial identities for the horizontal face maps of S••enable us to deduce
that the cup product ∪Ton TotC∗,∗is a cochain map. A direct computation gives
the fact. We show that a diagram
(3.1) H∗(TotC∗,∗)⊗H∗(TotC∗,∗)
H(AW∗)⊗H(AW∗)∼=/d15/d15∪T/d47/d47H∗(TotC∗,∗)
H(AW∗) ∼=/d15/d15
dualπ∗(diagK(S••))⊗dualπ∗(diagK(S••))∪/d47/d47dualπ∗(diagK(S••))
is commutative, where ∪is the usual cup product and AW denotes the Alexander-
Whitney map; see, for example, [45, 8.5.4]. The diagram
H∗(dual(TotCA))⊗H∗(dual(TotCA))
H(AW∗)⊗H(AW∗)/d15/d15/d47/d47H∗(dual(TotCA)⊗dual(TotCA))
H(AW∗⊗AW∗)/d15/d15
π∗(dualdiagA)⊗π∗(dualdiagA) /d47/d47π∗(dualdiagA⊗dualdiagA))
is commutative, where the horizontal maps are the canonical ones ,Ais the bisim-
plicial vector space K(S••) andCdenotes the double complex functor; see [45, 8.5].
Then, in order to prove the commutativity of the diagram (3.1), we s how that the
diagram
(3.2)H∗(dual(TotCA)⊗dual(TotCA))
H(AW∗⊗AW∗)∼=/d15/d15∪T/d47/d47H∗(dual(TotCA))
H(AW∗) ∼=/d15/d15
π∗(dualdiagA⊗dualdiagA))∪/d47/d47π∗(dualdiag K(S••))
is commutative. It is proved that F( ) :=H∗(dual(TotC( ))⊗dual(TotC( ))) and
π∗(dualdiag( )) are universal δ-functors from the category of bisimplicial K-vector
spaces to the opposite category of graded K-vector spaces. In fact, functors dual( )6 KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI
anddual( ) ⊗dual( ) areexact andpreserveprojectives. Moreover,functor s TotC( )
and diag( ) are also exact and preserve projectives; see [45, 8.5.2 and the proof of
8.5.1]. Thus, it follows that
π∗(dualdiag( )) = ( L∗π0)◦(dual◦diag)( ) =L∗(π0◦dual◦diag)( ) and
F( ) = (L∗H0)(dual(Tot C( ))⊗dual(TotC( )))
= (L∗H0)◦(dual⊗dual◦(TotC))( )
=L∗(H0◦dual⊗dual◦TotC))( ).
The result [45, Theorem 2.4.7] allows us to deduce that F( ) andπ∗(dualdiag( ))
are universal δ-functors.
Since the map H0(AW∗) is induced by the identity map on A00and the product
∪Tis nothing but the cup product, it follows that the diagram (3.2) is com mutative
onH0. Therefore, the universality of the functor F( ) enables us to conclude that
the diagram (3.2) is commutative. Thus, the double complex Tot C∗,∗induces the
multiplicative spectral sequence in the assertion.
In order to prove the latter half of the assertion, we deal with bisim plicial
sets and their geometric realizations. For a simplicial space X•, we see that
|(|Sing•′(X•)|•′)| ≃ |diagSing•′(X•)|by the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem; see, for ex-
ample, [38, Lemma, page 94] and [16, 7. Theorem].
LetYdenotethesimplicialspace |Sing•′(X•)|•′whichisthegeometricrealization
with respect to indices •′. SinceYis good in the sense that each degeneracy map
is a closed coﬁbration, it follows that there exists a natural homoto py equivalence
||Y||≃−→ |Y|; see [40, Proposition A.1. (iv)]. Moreover, the counit of the geomet ric
realization functor gives a natural weak homotopy equivalence Yn≃w−→Xnfor each
n. Therefore, the equivalence induces a homology isomorphism ||Y|| → ||X||; see
[14, Lemma 5.16]. It turns out that H∗(diagSing(X•),K)∼=H∗(||X||,K) as an
algebra by a natural map; see [10, Lemmas 1.2 and 1.3] for a homotop ical proof of
the fact. /square
Remark 3.1.One may expect a version of Theorem 2.1 for a simplicial diﬀeological
space. The isomorphism in the proof of the latter half of the theore m appears
to be well known. To obtain this fact, we take advantage of the Eilen berg–Zilber
theorem, which is also applied in [10]. The key to proving the powerful t heorem is
the use of the homeomorphism |K×∆[n]|∼=|K|×|∆[n]|for a simplicial set Kand
the standard simplicial set ∆[ n]. However, the diﬀeological realization functor | |D
in the sense of Kihara [24, Remark 22.1] or Christensen and Wu [13, Pr oposition
4.13] does notpreserve the product even if Kis the standard simplicial set in the
example above. Thus, we cannot prove verbatim a diﬀeological vers ion of Theorem
2.1. Indeed, it is not easy to replace the target of the spectral se quence in Theorem
2.2 iii) with a more familiar one for a general category internal to Diﬀ. To explain
this inconvenience, we have described the proof of the isomorphism .
Proof of Theorem 2.2. The assertion i) follows from the direct application of The-
orem 2.1. As for the assertion iii), we recall the result [29, Propositio n 3.4] which
yields that for any simplicial set K, there exists a sequence of quasi-isomorphisms
of cochain algebras between C∗(K;K) andA∗
DR(K). Then, by applying the ﬁrst
half of Theorem 2.1 to the bisimplicial set SD
•(Nerve •(C)), we obtain iii).ON MULTIPLICATIVE SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR NERVES 7
To demonstrate the assertion ii), we recall the proof of the result in [4, Equivari-
ant homology] which describes an equivalence between the Borel co homology and
the cohomology of a groupoid.
LetGbe the transformation groupoid [ G×X /d47/d47/d47/d47X].The principal G-bundle
π:EG×X→XG:=EG×GXdeﬁned by the quotient map gives rise to the
banal groupoid /tildewideG:= [(EG×X)×XG(EG×X)
π1/d47/d47π1/d47/d47(EG×X)],whereπiis the
projectionin the ith factor. Then, the groupoid /tildewideGis isomorphicto a transformation
groupoid of the form [ G×(EG×X) /d47/d47/d47/d47(EG×X)].In fact, we have a bundle
isomorphism

EG×G
which is deﬁned by µ(g,(e,x)) = ((eg−1,gx),(e,x)). Hereprdenotes the projection
in the second factor.
Since the quotient map πis a topological submersion, it follows from [4, Lemma
32] that the edge homomorphism H∗
G(X) =H∗(XG)∼=→H(TotC∗(Nerve •/tildewideG)) is
an isomorphism of algebras. The projection EG×X→Xin the second fac-
tor induces a morphism h:/tildewideG → G of groupoids. Since EGis contractible,
it follows from the spectral sequence argument that hinduces an isomorphism
h∗:H(TotC∗(Nerve •G))∼=→H(TotC∗(Nerve •/tildewideG)). As a consequence, we have the
spectral sequence converging to H∗
G(X) in ii). The local ﬁniteness of H∗(G) and
H∗(X) allows us to conclude that the chain complex {H∗(NervenG)}nwith the
horizontal diﬀerential is nothing but the cobar complex computing t he cotorsion
functor. We have the result. /square
As an input datum, our spectral sequence admits the nerveof a ca tegoryinternal
toDiﬀ. Thus, itisexpectedthatthemachinerywidelycontributestothec alculation
ofcohomologyalgebrasfornotonlytopologicalcategoriesbutalso diﬀeologicalones;
see Remark 3.2 below.
We recall the D-topology functor D:Diﬀ→Topfrom the category Diﬀof
diﬀeological spaces to that of topological spaces that admits the r ight adjoint C;
see Appendix B. Let VDbe the class consisting of diﬀeological spaces Mfor each of
which the identity map id:M→CDMis a weak equivalence in Diﬀ. Especially,
theresult [24, Theorem11.2]implies thata C∞-manifoldin the senseof[26, Section
27] and hence each component of the nerve of a Lie groupoid Gis inVD. In
particular, paracompact manifolds modeled on Hilbert spaces and th e space of
smooth maps between ﬁnite-dimensional manifolds are also in VD; see [24, Chapter
11.4] for more details.
Remark 3.2.Given a diﬀeological space X, letSD
n(X) be the set of smooth maps
toXfrom the standard n-simplex ∆n
stendowed with the diﬀeology in the sense of
Kihara [23, 1.2]. Then, the cosimplicial set structure on ∆n
stgives a simplicial set
SD
•(X) :={SD
n(X)}.
It followsfrom [23, Proposition 3.2] that D(∆n
st) is the standard simplex which is
a subspace of Rn+1. Thus, for a category Cinternal to Diﬀ, the smoothing theorem8 KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI
[24, Theorem 1.7] implies that the natural map
η:SD
•(Nerve •(C))→Sing•(D(Nerve •(C)))
induced by the functor Dis a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets pro-
vided each A:= Nerve n(C) is in the class VD; see Theorem 6.2 for a particular
version of the smoothing theorem. Therefore, by [18, Chapter I V, Proposition
1.7], we see that diag SD
•(Nerve •(C))≃wdiagSing•(D(Nerve •(C))). It turns out
that the spectral sequence in Theorem 2.2 iii) converges to the coh omology algebra
H∗(||D(Nerve •(C))||;R).
We apply the argument above to a transformation diﬀeological grou poidG:=
[G×N /d47/d47/d47/d47N] for which Gis a Lie group and Nis inVD. It follows from [12,
Lemma4.1]that thenaturalmap D(X×Y)→D(X)×D(Y)isahomeomorphismif
D(X) is locally compact Hausdorﬀ. This implies that D(G×n×N)∼=G×n×D(N).
Moreover, the functor Cis the right adjoint to Dand henceCpreserves the prod-
ucts. We conclude that each component Nerve n(G) =G×n×Nof the nerve of G
is inVD. As a consequence, the spectral sequence in Theorem 2.2 iii) conve rges
toH∗(||D(Nerve •(G))||;R)∼=H∗(||Nerve•(DG)||;R)∼=H∗(EG×GDN;R) as al-
gebras, where DGdenotes a topological groupoid of the form [ G×DN /d47/d47/d47/d47DN] ;
see the proof of Theorem 2.2 for the second isomorphism. Thus, we may describe
the generators of H∗(EG×GD(N);R) with diﬀerential forms on N, although we
do not pursue such a topic in this article; see Section 6 for a related t opic.
Remark 3.3.LetGbe a Lie groupoid presenting a diﬀerentiable stack X. By deﬁni-
tion, the de Rham cohomology H∗
DR(X) of the stack is the cohomology of the total
complex of the bigraded de Rham complex A:=∧∗(Nerve •(G)); see [4, Deﬁnition
9]. By Proposition B.4, the factor map α:∧∗(Nerve •(G))→A∗
DR(SD
•(Nerve •(G))
is a natural quasi-isomorphism.
Moreover, the result [29, Proposition 3.4] asserts that there exis ts a sequence of
naturalquasi-isomorphismsofcochainalgebrasbetween C:=C∗(SD
•(Nerve •(G);K)
andA∗
DR(SD
•(Nerve •(G)). Thus, wehaveasequenceofquasi-isomorphismsbetween
the total complexes (Tot C,∪T) and (TotA,∧T) which preserve products; see (2.1)
and(2.2)fortheformulaeof ∪Tand∧T, respectively. Therefore, becauseNerve •(G)
is a manifold, the proof of the latter half of Theorem 2.1 and the same argument as
in Remark 3.2 enable us to conclude that H∗
DR(X)∼=H∗(BG,R)as an algebra . We
observe that the product ∧Tcoincides with that in the total complex mentioned in
[4, (6)].
4.Computational examples
The aim of this section is to compute the cohomology algebra of the fr ee loop
space of the real projective space. Let Gbe adiscretegroup acting on a topological
spaceM. Forg∈G, we deﬁne Pg(M) :={γ: [0,1]→M|γ(1) =gγ(0)}which

with the compact-open topology. Moreover, we put

g∈G(Pg(M)×{g}). (4.1)
Then, the space PG(M) admits a G-action deﬁned by h·(γ,g) = (hγ,hgh−1),
wherehγ(t) =h·γ(t). For a space X, letLXdenote the free loop space of X,ON MULTIPLICATIVE SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR NERVES 9

be a principal G-bundle. Proposition A.1 enables us to obtain a weak homotopy
equivalence
(4.2) p:EG×GPG(M)≃w−→L(M/G)
which is induced by the projection p:M→M/G. Thus, we see that the spectral

groupoid of the form G= [G×PG(M) /d47/d47/d47/d47PG(M)] and hence that of L(M/G).
Suppose that Mis simply connected. Foreach g∈G, to compute H∗(Pg(M);K)

In the rest of this section, by utilizing the spectral sequence in The orem 2.2
ii), we determine the cohomology algebra of the free loop space LRPnof the real
projective space with coeﬃcients in Z/pforp/ne}ationslash= 2. Moreover, we investigate the
mod 2 cohomology algebra of LRPnin a more general context; see Proposition 4.4.
A portion of the computations, in general, follows from a description of the
cotorsion functor with the cohomology of a group; see Lemma 5.1, T heorem 5.2
and Corollary 5.4 below. However, we here compute the functor with the cobar
complex to see what is happening in the E1-term of the spectral sequence that we
apply in the computation.10 KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI
Theorem 4.1. Letpbe an odd prime or 0andma positive integer, then as

wheredegy= 2m+ 1,degy= 2m,deg(x⊗u) = 4m−1,degw= 4m−2and
Z/0 :=Q.
Before starting the proof of Theorem 4.1, we recall a result on a rig htGaction
on a vector space and the right G-coaction associated with the action. Let Gbe
a ﬁnite group and η:K[G]⊗V→VaG-action on a ﬁnite-dimensional vector
spaceV. The leftG-action gives rise to the right G-actionϕ:V∨⊗K[G]→V∨
deﬁned byϕ(f⊗g)(v) =f(η(g⊗v)) forv∈V. Moreover, we see that the adjoint
ad(ϕ) :V∨→K[G]∨⊗V∨coincides with the dual coaction η∨:V∨→K[G]∨⊗V∨.
We use the fact in the computation below without mentioning that.
In what follows, we may omit the coeﬃcients in the cohomology groups that we
deal with.
Proof of Theorem 4.1. The antipodal action of G:=Z/2 on the sphere Sngives
rise to the real projective space RPn=Sn/G. By applying Theorem 2.2 ii) to
the groupoid [ G×PG(Sn) /d47/d47/d47/d47PG(Sn)], we have a spectral sequence {E∗,∗

H∗(G)(Z/p,H∗(PG(Sn))) as an

whereτ∈Gdenotes the nontrivial element, ∇τ∗:H∗(Pg(Sn))→/tildewideH0(G)⊗
H∗(Pg(Sn)) =Z/p{τ∗} ⊗H∗(Pg(Sn)) is the coaction induced by the G-action
onPg(Sn) and the projection G× Pg(Sn)→ Pg(Sn) gives rise to the map ∇G.
Observe that the complex is nothing but the E1-term of the spectral sequence
{E∗,∗
r,dr}.
In what follows, we may write Kfor the underlying ﬁeld Z/p. We consider the
EMSS associated with the ﬁbre square (4.3) for M=Sn.
For the case n= 2m+ 1, the action on H∗(S2m+1)∼=∧(y) induced by the
nontrivial element τis given by τ∗(y) =y. Therefore, the computation in [31,
Theorem 2.1] allows us to conclude that the cohomology algebra H∗(Pg(Sn)) is
isomorphic to H∗(LS2m+1) for eachg∈G. The naturality of the EMSS implies
that the action by g∗onH∗(LS2m+1) is trivial and then so is the coaction. This
yields that E0,∗

∞and there is no extension problem.
The explicit form of H∗(LS2m+1) follows from [31, Theorem 2.1]. This enables us
to obtain the ﬁrst assertion.ON MULTIPLICATIVE SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR NERVES 11
We consider the case where n= 2m. In order to compute the torsion functor
which gives the E2-term of the EMSS, we recall a Koszul–Tate resolution of the
form
F= (Λ⊗Λ⊗∧(u)⊗Γ[w],d)ε→Λ→0
of Λ :=H∗(S2m) =K[x]/(x2) as a left Λ ⊗Λ-module, where εis the multiplication
on Λ,d(Λ⊗Λ) = 0,d(u) =x⊗1−1⊗x,d(γr(w)) = (x⊗1+1⊗x)u⊗γr−1(w),
bidegu= (−1,degx) and bideg γr(w) =r(−2,2degx); see [41, Proposition 3.5]
and [27, Proposition 1.1]. The complex (Λ ⊗Λ⊗ΛF,1⊗d) computes the Hochschild
homology of Λ. Using the resolution, we determine H∗(P0(Sn)) andH∗(Pτ(Sn))
for the nontrivial element τ∈G
Claim4.2. i)H∗(P0(S2m))∼={K[x]/(x2)⊗∧(u)/(xu)A}⊕{(x,u)A/(xu)A}⊗Γ+[w]
as an algebra, where (S)Adenotes the ideal of A:=K[x]/(x2)⊗∧(u)generated by
a setS. Moreover, τ∗(z) =−zforz∈/tildewideH∗(P0(Sn)).
ii)H∗(Pτ(S2m))∼=∧(x⊗u)⊗Γ[w]as an algebra and τ∗(z) =zfor each element
z∈ ∧(x⊗u)⊗Γ[w].
It follows from Claim 4.2 i) that Cotor∗,∗
H∗(G)(Z/p,H∗(P0(S2m))) =Z/p. More-
over, Claim 4.2 ii) enables us to conclude that
Cotori,∗
H∗(G)(Z/p,H∗(Pτ(S2m)))∼=/braceleftbigg∧(x⊗u)⊗Γ[w] fori= 0

We have the result. /square
Proof of Claim 4.2. Letnbe an even integer 2 m. i) Since P0(Sn) is nothing but
the free loop space LSn, the result on the algebra structure follows from the results
in [37, 4.1] and [31, Theorem 2.2]. In order to prove the latter assert ion on the
action, we represent elements in the Koszul–Tate resolution with th e bar resolution
B∗,∗of Λ as a left Λ ⊗Λ-module. Let ψ:B∗,∗→ Fbe the chain map constructed
in the proof of [27, Lemma 1.5], which induces an isomorphism between t he torsion
functors. We see that ψ(x) =x,ψ(u) = [x⊗1−1⊗x] and
Ψ(1Λ⊗Λ[x⊗1+1⊗x|x⊗1−1⊗x| ··· |x⊗1+1⊗x|x⊗1−1⊗x]1Λ) =γr(w).
Sinceτ∗(x) =−xforx∈H∗(Sn), it follows that τ∗(u) =−uandτ∗(γr(w)) =
γr(w). Consider the morphism of spectral sequences induced by the dia gram
(4.4). Then, the naturality of the EMSS and the forms of algebra ge nerators of
H∗(P0(Sn)) enable us to obtain the latter half of i).
ii) To compute the cohomology algebra H∗(Pτ(Sn)) for the nontrivial element
τ∈G, we consider the EMSS {/tildewideE∗,∗
r,/tildewidedr}associated with the pullback diagram
(4.3) converging to the cohomology H∗(Pτ(Sn)). As mentioned in the proof of i),
theτ-action onHn(Sn) is nothing but the multiplication by −1. Thus, the right
Λ⊗Λ-modulestructure on Λ τ:=H∗(Sn) is given by a·(λ⊗λ′) =−aλλ′fora∈Λτ
andλ⊗λ∈Λ⊗Λ. This yields that
/tildewideE∗,∗
2∼=TorΛ⊗Λ(Λτ,Λ)∼=(Λτ⊗Λ⊗ΛF,d′(u) = 2x,d′(γr(w)) = 0)∼=∧(x⊗u)⊗Γ[w]
as bigraded algebras, where bideg( x⊗u) = (−1,2n). For degree reasons, we see
that the EMSS collapses at the E2-term. In fact, the possibility of a nontrivial
diﬀerential appears as ds(γpf(w)) =αx⊗u·γl(w) for some positive integers s,f,
land someα∈K. We observe that s≥2. Comparing the total degrees of both
elements in the equality, we have (2 n−1)pf+1 = (2n−1) +(2n−2)land then12 KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI
pf=l+1. By comparingthe ﬁltration degree, wesee that −2pf+s=−1−2(pf−1)
ands= 1, which is a contradiction.
We have to show that γf
p(w)p= 0 inH∗(Pτ(Sn)) forf≥0. The extension
problems are solved by degree reasons. It turns out that H∗(Pτ(Sn))∼=Tot/tildewideE∗,∗

ByusingthechainmapΨ : B∗,∗→ Fasmentionedabove,weseethat τ∗(x⊗u) =
(−1)(−1)x⊗uandτ∗(γr(w)) =γr(w). Thus, by considering again the morphism
of spectral sequences induced by the diagram (4.4), we have the r esult on the
action. /square
Remark 4.3.The path space P0(Sn) is nothing but the free loop space LSn. Then,
the inclusion LSn=P0(Sn)→EG× P0(Sn) deﬁnes a natural map α:LSn→
EG×GP0(Sn). Moreover, we have a commutative diagram

weak homotopy equivalent to the path component of LRPnconsisting of constant
loops under the equivalence (4.2). In particular, the proof of Theo rem 4.1 allows
us to conclude that the cohomology of the component with coeﬃcien ts inZ/pis
isomorphic to Z/pifnis even.
We here attempt to compute the cohomology of the free loop space of a Borel
constructionwithcoeﬃcientsin Z/2byusingthesamemethodasabove. Weindeed
use the multiplicative structure of the spectral sequence that we apply.
LetGbe the cyclic group Z/2 andMa simply-connected, mod 2 homology
n-sphere that admits a G-action, where n≥2. Further assume that the Borel
cohomology H∗(EG×GM;Z/2) is of ﬁnite dimension. Let L0(EG×GM) be the
connected component of the free loop space L(EG×GM) containing the constant
loops. Then, we have the following result.
Proposition 4.4. As an algebra, H∗(L0(EG×GM);Z/2)∼=Γ[y]⊗/parenleftbig

G2:= [G×(EG×M) /d47/d47/d47/d47EG×M], respectively. Let /tildewiderev0:G1→ G2be the mor-
phism of groupoids induced by the evaluation map ev0:P0(EG×M)→EG×M
at 0∈I, whereev0is the evaluation map at 0. Observe that ev0is aG-equivariant
map. Thus, we have a commutative diagram

r,1dr}and{2E∗,∗
r,2dr}be the spectral sequences
in Theorem 2.2 ii) with coeﬃcients in Z/2 constructed by groupoids G1andG2,
respectively. We observe that P0(EG×M) =L(EG×M)≃LM.
By the assumption on M, we see that H∗(LM)∼=Z/2[xn]/(x2
n)⊗Γ[y] as an
algebra, where deg xn=nand degy=n−1. In fact, the isomorphism for nodd
follows from [31, Theorem 2.1]. Moreover, the computation in [37, 4.1] gives the
result forneven. Indeed, we need an explicit form of the mod 2 cohomology grou p
of ΩMas an input datum; that is, H∗(ΩM;Z/2)∼=Γ[y], where deg y=n−1. This
fact follows from the computation of the EMSS converging to H∗(ΩM;Z/2) with
E,∗
2∼=Tor∗,∗
H∗(M)(Z/2,Z/2).
Since each dimension of Ai:=Hi(P0(EG×M)) is one or zero. Thus, the
G-action onAiis trivial. This fact and the formula (2.1) allow us to deduce that
1E∗,∗
2∼=Cotor∗,∗
H∗(G)(Z/2,A∗)∼=A∗⊗Z/2[t]∼=Z/2[xn]/(x2
n)⊗Γ[y]⊗Z/2[t]
as algebras, where bideg t= (1,0). The same argument as above is applicable to
the spectral sequence {2E∗,∗
r,2dr}. Then, it follows that
2E∗,∗
2∼=Cotor∗,∗
H∗(G)(Z/2,H∗(M))∼=Z/2[xn]/(x2
n)⊗Z/2[t]
as algebras.
We consider the morphism {fr}:{2E∗,∗
r,2dr} → { 1E∗,∗
r,2dr}of spectral se-
quences induced by /tildewiderev0. The construction of the spectral sequence yields that
f2(xn) =xnandf2(t) =t. By assumption, the vector space H∗(EG×GM)
is of ﬁnite dimensional. Therefore, we see that 2dn+1(xn) =tn+1and hence
1dn+1(xn) =tn+1. To complete the proof, it remains to show that 1dn−1(y) = 0
but not 1dn(y) =tn. Sinceev0:L0(EG×GM)→EG×GMhas a section, it
follows that the map ev∗
0induced on the cohomology is a monomorphism. This
implies that 1dn−1(y) = 0. /square
Remark 4.5.In the spectral sequence {1E∗,∗
r,1dr}above, there is a possibility that
1dn(γ2(xn)) =xn⊗tn. In the computation above, we can use the Leray–Serre
spectral sequence for a Borel ﬁbration of the form X→EG×GX→BGinstead
of the spectral sequence in Theorem 2.2 ii). However, the same pos sibility of the
non-trivial diﬀerential as above remains.
Remark 4.6.We observe that Proposition 4.4 is applicable to the real projective
space. LetMbe the 3-dimensional real projective space RP3which is regarded as
the homogeneous space of S3=SU(2) by the center Z/2. SinceMis an H-space, it
follows that L(M)≃Ω[e]M×M≃(ΩeS3/coproducttextΩeS3)×M, wheree∈S3denotes the
unit; see the proof of Proposition A.1 for the second weak homotop y equivalence.
Then it turns out that H∗(LM;Z/2)∼=(Γ[s−1x])⊕2⊗/parenleftbig
Z/2[t]/(t4)/parenrightbig
as an algebra.
5.A spectral sequence for a Borel construction
In the previous section, we apply the spectral sequence in Theore m 2.2 ii) to a
computation of the cohomology of a transformation groupoid. In t his section, the
result is generalized with a description of the cotorsion functor by t he cohomology
ofa ﬁnite group. Moreover, we give a spectral sequence for comp uting the cohomol-
ogy of the classifying space of inertiagroupoids, while there is no computational
example.14 KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI
We begin with a lemma relating the cotorsion functor to the cohomolog y of a
group. Let Gbe a ﬁnite group and Na ﬁnite-dimensional left K[G]∨-comodule.
Then the module N∨is regarded as a left K[G]-module via the natural map ∇∨:
K[G]⊗N∨→N∨induced by the left comodule structure ∇onN. Thus, by using
the isomorphism N∼=(N∨)∨, we consider Na rightK[G]-module.
For a Hopf algebra Awith antipode S, we have an injective algebra homomor-
phismδ:A→Ae=A⊗Aopdeﬁned by δ(a) =/summationtexta1⊗S(a2); see [46, Lemma
9.4.1].
Lemma 5.1. Under the setup above, there are isomorphisms of vector spac es
Cotor∗
K[G]∨(K,N)∼=HH∗(K[G],K⊗N)∼=Ext∗
K[G](K,K⊗N) =H∗(G,N).
Here the module Nin the Hochschild cohomology is regarded as a right K[G]-module
mentionedabove. Moreover, the module K⊗Nin the groupcohomology is considered
a leftK[G]-module via the monomorphism δ.
Proof.The ﬁrst isomorphism follows from [2, Theorem 3.4]. As for the secon d
isomorphism, we repeat the proof of [46, Theorem 9.4.5] verbatim. For a general
Hopf algebra A, the result [46, Lemma 9.4.2] enables us to conclude that the map
f:A→Ae⊗AKdeﬁned by f(a) =a⊗1⊗1 is an isomorphism of Ae-modules,
whereAedenotes the enveloping algebra of A. Then, it follows that Extn
Ae(A,T)∼=
Extn
Ae(Ae⊗AK,T)∼=Extn
A(K,T) for a left Ae-moduleT. We observe that the
latter isomorphism is given by Eckmann-Shapiro Lemma; see, for exa mple, [46,
Lemma A.6.2]. This completes the proof. /square
We can generalize the computation in Section 4.
Theorem 5.2. (cf. [9, Chapter II, Theorem 19.2]) LetGbe a ﬁnite group acting
on a spaceXwhose cohomology with coeﬃcients in Kis locally ﬁnite. Suppose that
ch(K)the characteristic of Kis coprime with |G|. Then as an algebra
H∗(EG×GX;K)∼=K✷K[G]∨H∗(X;K),
where the right-hand side algebra denotes the cotensor prod uct of the trivial right
K[G]∨-comodule Kand the left K[G]∨-comoduleH∗(X;K).

We see that the coalgebra structure ∇:H∗(X)→H∗(G)⊗H∗(X) is a morphism
of algebras. Then, the cotensor product K✷K[G]∨H∗(X) is a subalgebra of H∗(X).
It turns out that the spectral sequence of algebras collapses at theE2-term and
there is no extension problem. We have the result. /square
Remark 5.3.LetGbe a ﬁnite group acting on a space X. Then, the inclusion
from the unit to Ggives rise to a morphism ι: [{e}×X /d47/d47/d47/d47X] /d47/d47[G×X /d47/d47/d47/d47X]

Theorem 5.2 allows us to compute the cohomology algebra of the free loop space
of a Borel construction.
Corollary 5.4. (cf. [32, Corollary 6.5]) LetGbe a ﬁnite group acting on a space
MandPG(M)the space deﬁned in (4.1). Suppose that H∗(PG(M);K)is locally

Proof.Theorem 5.2 and Corollary A.2 imply the assertion. /square
Remark 5.5.LetMbe a simply-connected G-space whose cohomology with coef-

which computes the E2-term of the EMSS for the ﬁbre square (4.3), is locally ﬁnite
and hence so is H∗(PG(M);K) ifGis ﬁnite.
Remark 5.6.LetG→Mp→M/Gbe a principal G-bundle with ﬁnite ﬁbre G. The

We consider a spectral sequence for the inertia groupoid associat ed with a topo-
logical groupoid G; see [6, Chapters 11 and 16] for such a groupoid and its impor-
tance in string topology for stacks. In particular, we have a canon ical morphism
from the inertia groupoid of Gto the loop groupoid; see [6, 12.4].
LetG= [G1 /d47/d47/d47/d47G0] be a topologicalgroupoid. By deﬁnition, a space Xwith a
mapp:X→G0is aG-spaceifXis endowedwith an action G1t×p
G0X→X, where
G1t×p
G0Xdenotes the pullback of palong the target map t:G1→G0. Then,
thetranslation groupoid associated with the G-spaceXis deﬁned by G⋉X:=
[G1t×p
G0X /d47/d47/d47/d47X] whose source and target maps are deﬁned by the projection in
the second factor and the action, respectively.
For a topological groupoid G, we deﬁne a subspace SGofG1and mapp:SG→
G0bySG:={g∈G1|s(g) =t(g)}andp(g) =s(g), respectively. Then, the
conjugation on G1gives rise to an action G1t×p
G0SG→SG. The translation
groupoid Λ G:=G⋉SGis called the inertia groupoid associated with G. We also
deﬁne the evaluation map
ev0: ΛG= [G1t×p
G0SG /d47/d47/d47/d47SG]→ G= [G1 /d47/d47/d47/d47G0]
by the projection in the ﬁrst factor in morphisms and by the source map ofGin
the objects.
LetGbe a ﬁnite group and G⋉M:= [G×M /d47/d47/d47/d47M] a translation groupoid.
Applyingtheconstructionabove,wehavetheinertiagroupoidΛ( G⋉M). Moreover,
we see that the groupid has the form
Λ(G⋉M) = [G×/coproducttext
g∈G(Mg×{g}) /d47/d47/d47/d47/coproducttext
g∈G(Mg×{g})],
whereMgdenotes the space of ﬁxed points of g. Observe that the source map
is the projection of the second factor and the conjugation gives r ise to the target
mapt, more precisely, t(h,(m,g)) = (hm,hgh−1); see [6, (17.2.1)]. By virtue of
Theorem 2.2 ii), we have the following result.
Proposition 5.8. LetG⋉Mbe a transformation groupoid for which Gis a ﬁnite
group andH∗(Mg)is locally ﬁnite for each g∈G. Then there exists a spectral
sequence {Er,dr}converging to the cohomology of the classifying space BΛ(G⋉M)
of the inertia groupoid Λ(G⋉M), as an algebra with
Ep,q
2∼=Cotorp,q
H0(G)(K,⊕g∈GH∗(Mg;K)).
Moreover, the evaluation map gives rise to a morphism from th e spectral sequence
in Theorem 2.2 ii) to {Er,dr}. Assume further that (ch(K),|G|) = 1, then one has
H∗(BΛ(G⋉M);K)∼=K✷K[G]∨(⊕g∈GH∗(Mg;K))as an algebra.
LetGbe adiscretegroup. We considerthe freeloopspace LBGoftheclassifying
spaceBG=EG/G=EG×G∗.
Proposition 5.9. (cf. [32, Example 6.2] and [7, Proposition 2.12.2]) LetGbe a
ﬁnite group. Then as an algebra,
H∗(LBG;K)∼=Cotor∗
K[G]∨(K,(K[G]ad)∨),
whereK[G]addenotes the adjoint representation of G. Especially, if Gis abelian,
thenH∗(LBG;K)∼=H∗(G;K)⊕|G|as an algebra.ON MULTIPLICATIVE SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR NERVES 17
Proof.It follows that H∗(Pg(∗);K) =Kfor eachg∈G. By the deﬁnition of the G-
action on PG(∗), we see that H∗(PG(∗);K)∼=K[G]ad. Then, the weak equivalence
in (4.2) and the spectral sequence {E∗,∗
r,dr}in Theorem 2.2 ii) enable us to deduce
the ﬁrst assertion. Observe that E∗,q
2= 0 forq>0.
The latter half follows from the fact that the G-action on K[G]adis trivial. In
particular, the explicit formula (2.1) of the multiplication on the cotor sion product
yields the result on the algebra structure. /square
Remark 5.10.IfGis abelian, then the classifying space BGis an H-space. This
allows us to obtain a homotopy equivalence BG×ΩBG≃→LBGinduced by the
product on BG. The latter half of Proposition 5.9 also follows from the fact.
We conclude this section with comments on a spectral sequence con verging to
the free loop space of a Borel construction, which is obtained by Th eorem 2.2 ii).
Remark 5.11.LetGbe a ﬁnite group with an action on a space Mand{E∗,∗
r,dr}
the spectral sequence in Theorem 2.2 ii) for the Borel constructio nEG×GPG(M).
By Corollary A.2, we see that L(EG×GM) is connected to EG×GPG(M) with
weak homotopy equivalences. Thus, under the same condition as in C orollary 5.4
but (ch(K),|G|) = 1, the spectral sequence converges to H∗(L(EG×GM);K) as
an algebra.
The form ofthe E2-term enables us to deduce that the vertical edge ( q-axis)E0,∗
2
is isomorphic to the cotensor product K✷K[G]∨H∗(PG(M);K), which is a subspace
ofH∗(PG(M);K) detected by the transfer homomorphism if (ch( K),|G|) = 1; see
[9, Chapter II, Theorem 19.2] and Lemma 5.1.
We consider the horizontal edge ( p-axis). Since the trivial map v:Pg(M)→ ∗
givesaG-equivariantmap H0(PG(M);K)→K[G]ad, it followsfromProposition5.9
that the edge E∗,0
2is a module overthe cotorsionproduct Cotor∗
K[G]∨(K,(K[G]ad)∨)
and henceH∗(LBG;K) via the morphism
v∗:H∗(LBG;K)→Cotor∗,0
K[G]∨(K,H∗(PG(M);K))
of algebras induced by v. Observe that the v∗is an isomorphism of algebras if
Mis simply-connected. In fact, we see that each Pg(M) is connected in that
case. We remark that the underlying algebra H∗(LBG;K) is indeed the Hochschild
cohomology of the group ring K[G]; see [7, Proposition 2.12.2].
Each diﬀerential on E∗,0
rforr≥2 is trivial. Therefore, the multiplicative struc-
ture on the spectral sequence gives rise to an H∗(LBG;K)-module structure on the
spectral sequence; that is, each term E∗,∗
radmits anH∗(LBG;K)-module structure
deﬁned by

Thus we see that dr(a•x) = (−1)pa•dr(x) fora∈Hp(LBG;K) andx∈E∗,∗

6.The de Rham cohomology of the diffeological free loop space o f
a non-simply connected manifold
LetGbe a ﬁnite group acting freely and smoothly on a manifold M. Then, a
principalG-bundle of the form G→Mp→M/Gin the category of manifolds is18 KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI
obtained. Let P∞
G(M) be the diﬀeological space obtained by applying the construc-
tion (4.1) in Diﬀthe categoryof diﬀeological spaces; see Appendix B. We consider a
smoothmap /tildewidep:P∞
G(M)→L∞(M/G) deﬁned by /tildewidep((γ,g)) =p◦γ, whereL∞(M/G)
denotes the diﬀeological free loop space of M/G; see the pullback diagram (4.3).
For a diﬀeological space X, we may write H∗
DR(X) for the singular de Rham
cohomology H∗(ADR(SD
•(X))); see Appendix B. The purpose of this section is to
prove the following theorem.
Theorem 6.1. Under the same setting as above, suppose further that Mis simply
connected. Then, the smooth map /tildewidepgives rise to a well-deﬁned isomorphism
/tildewidep∗:H∗
DR(L∞(M/G))∼=→R✷R[G]∨H∗
DR(P∞
G(M))
of algebras.
Each component P∞
g(M) ofP∞
G(M) is constructed with a pullback of the form
(4.3). Then, by utilizing Theorem B.5, we may represent algebra gene rators in the
de Rham cohomology H∗
DR(L∞(M/G)) with diﬀerential forms on Mvia Chen’s
iterated integral map and the factormap, which connects the Souriau-de Rham
complex and the singular de Rham complex; see Appendix B.1. Indeed, the idea is
realized in Theorem 6.4.
Before proving Theorem 6.1, we recall the smoothing theorem due t o Kihara for
a particular case. Let MandNbe diﬀeological spaces and C∞(M,N) the space
of smooth maps from MtoNwith the functional diﬀeology. We recall the functor
D:Diﬀ→Topfrom Appendix B. Then, we see that D(∆n
st) is homeomorphic to
∆nthe standard nsimplex which is a subspace of Rn+1; see [24]. Moreover, the
inclusioni:D(C∞(M,N))→C0(DM,DN ) is continuous; see [12, Proposition
4.2]. Thus, it follows that the functor Dinduces a morphism ξ:SD
•(C∞(M,N))→
Sing•(C0(DM,DN )) of simplicial sets.
Theorem 6.2. (Smoothing theorem [24, Theorems 1.1 and 1.7]) LetMandNbe
ﬁnite-dimensional manifolds. Then, the well-deﬁned map
ξ:SD
•(C∞(M,N))→Sing•(C0(DM,DN ))
is a weak homotopy equivalence.
For a manifold M, we consider the composite
λ:=i◦(Dj) :D(P∞
g(M)) /d47/d47D(C∞([0,1],M)) /d47/d47C0(D[0,1],DM),
wherejdenotes the smooth inclusion P∞
g(M)→C∞([0,1],M). SinceDM=M
andD[0,1] is the subspace IofR(see [12, Lemma 3.16]), it follows that λ:
D(P∞
g(M))→ Pg(M) is continuous. Therefore, the composite ξ′:=λ∗◦ξ:
SD
•(P∞
g(M))→Sing•(Pg(M)) is a morphism of simplicial sets.
The following lemma is a key to proving Theorem 6.1.
Lemma 6.3. LetMbe a simply-connected manifold. Then, one has a sequence of
quasi-isomorphisms
APL(Sing•(Pg(M)))⊗QR(ξ′)∗

•(P∞

Proof.The result [29, Corollary3.5] allows us to obtain a quasi-isomorphism ζ. We
consider a commutative diagram
H∗(ADR(SD
•(P∞
g(M))) Tor∗
ADR(SD(M×2))(ADR(SD(M)),ADR(SD(MI)))∼=EM1/d111/d111

Tor∗

in which the horizontal maps are induced by the Eilenberg–Moore map ; see [21,
20.6]. Here, we write APL(X) forAPL(Sing•(X)) in the right-hand corner and ( ) R
denotes the tensor product ( ) ⊗QR.
By assumption, the manifold Mis simply connected. Then, the proofs of [29,
Theorem 5.5] and [21, 20.6] yield that EM1andEM3are isomorphisms, respec-
tively. Since ζis a quasi-isomorphism, it follows that the vertical maps in the
upper square are isomorphisms and then so is EM2. We see that MIis smooth
homotopy equivalent to M. Therefore, Theorem 6.2 implies that Tor( ξ∗,ξ∗) is an
isomorphism. It turns out that ( ξ′)∗is a quasi-isomorphism. /square

compositeofthe morphism induced by ξin Theorem6.2and the quasi-isomorphism
ζ:APL(K)⊗QR→ADR(K) for a simplicial set Kin [29, Corollary 3.5]. Thus,
Theorem 6.2 implies that ( /tildewideξ)∗in the top row is an isomorphism. We observe that,
by Remark 5.6, the map /tildewidep∗on the left-hand side is an isomorphism.
Lemma C.1 implies that map ( q∗)∗on the right-hand side induced by the smooth
mapq:I→S1inDiﬀis an isomorphism. A usual argument on the quotient
mapq:I→S1shows that the projection induces a weak homotopy equivalence
(q∗) :C0(S1,M/G)→L(M/G) and hence the left-hand side map ( q∗)∗is an
isomorphism. Since the map H(/tildewideξ1) in the lowest row is also an isomorphism, it
follows that the right-hand side map /tildewidep∗is an isomorphism. We have the result. /square20 KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI

that 1×gis aninduction . Then, Theorem B.5 is applicable to this case. Moreover,
it follows from Theorem 6.1, Lemma 6.3 and the computation in Theorem 4.1 that
H∗
DR(L∞RP2m)∼=H∗(ADR(SD
•(P∞
τ(S2m)))⊕R∼=H∗(Pτ(S2m));R)⊕R
as algebras. Observe that /tildewidep∗gives the ﬁrst isomorphism. The same computa-
tion with the cyclic bar complex as in [28, Theorem 2.1] allows us to deduc e that
v2m[v2m] and 1[v2m|v2m] are non-exact cocycles. With the indecomposable ele-
ments of the second algebra in Theorem 4.1, we see that deg( x⊗u) = 4m−1 =
degv2m[v2m] and degw= 4m−2 = deg1[v2m|v2m]. Thus, we have the result.
The same argument as above enables us to obtain the isomorphisms in the ﬁrst
sequence. /square

LetG→Mp→M/Gbe a principal G-bundle with discreteﬁbreG. Under the
same notations as in Section 4, we show the following proposition.

Since the projection p2:EG×M→Mis aG-equivariant map and a homotopy
equivalence, it follows that /tildewidep2:Pm
G(EG×M)→ Pm
G(M) induced by p2is weak
homotopy equivalent and hence so is /tildewidep2:EG×GPG(EG×M)→EG×GPG(M).
Moreover,PropositionA.1isapplicabletothe G-bundleG→EG×M→EG×GM.

tive diagram

3.2.2] yields the left-hand side ﬁbration; see also [33, Proposition B.1]. The maps
πand/tildewideπgive a morphism of ﬁbrations from G→EG×M→EG×GMto
G→M→M/Gwhich is the identity map on the ﬁbres. Since EGis contractible,
it follows that /tildewideπis a weak homotopy equivalence. Therefore, in order to prove the
result, it suﬃces to show that the map p:Pm
G(M)→Ω[m](M/G) is weak homotopy
equivalent.
We consider the map p∗:πn(Pm
G(M),/tildewideγ)→πn(Ω[m](M/G),γ) induced by the
projectionp:M→M/Gforn≥1. For an element β:Sn→Ω[m](M/G) in
πn(Ω[m](M/G),γ), the adjoint gives rise to a map ad(β) : ΣSn→M, where ΣSn
denotes the unreduced suspension of Sn. Letfβ:Sn×I→Mbe the composite of
ad(β) and the projection Sn×I→ΣSn. Observe that fβ(∗,t) =γ(t). Since ΣSnis
homeomorphic to Sn+1, it is immediate that ( fβ)∗(π1(Sn×I)) ={0} ⊂p∗(π1(M)).22 KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI
Then the lifting theorem for covering spaces allows us to obtain a lift /tildewiderfβoffβ. We
see that (p)∗(ad(/tildewiderfβ)) =β. Thus, the map p∗is surjective.
LetH:Sn×I→Ω[m](M/G) be a homotopy from p(α0) top(α1) based at
γ, whereα0andα1are elements in πn(Pm
G(M),/tildewideγ). Then, we have a lift K:
Sn×I×I→Mof the adjoint ad(H) :Sn×I×I→ΣSn×I→M/G. It follows
from the uniqueness of the lift that ad(K) :Sn×I→ Pm
G(M) is a homotopy from
α0toα1based at /tildewideγ.
The same argument with the lifting theorem as above allows us to show the
bijectivity of the map p∗:π0(Pm
G(M))→π0(Ω[m](M/G)). This completes the
proof. /square
Appendix B.Diffeological spaces
We begin by reviewing the deﬁnitions of a diﬀeology and a diﬀeological sp ace.
A good reference for the subjects is the book [22]. Additionally, we r ecall the
deﬁnitions of Souriau–de Rham complex, the singular de Rham complex for a dif-
feological space and a morphism of diﬀerential graded algebras con necting the two
complexes; see [29] for the details.
Deﬁnition B.1. LetXbe a set. A set Dof functions U→Xfor each open subset
UinRnand eachn∈Nis adiﬀeology ofXif the following three conditions hold:
(1) Every constant map U→Xfor all open subset U⊂Rnis inD;
(2) IfU→Xis inD, then for any smooth map V→Ufrom an open subset
VofRm, the composite V→U→Xis also in D;
(3) IfU=∪iUiis an open coverand U→Xis amap suchthat eachrestriction
Ui→Xis inD, then the map U→Xis inD.
We call an open subset of Rnadomain. Adiﬀeological space (X,D) consists of
a setXand a diﬀeology DofX. An element of a diﬀeology Dis called a plotofX.
Let (X,DX) and (Y,DY) be diﬀeological spaces. A map X→Yissmoothif for
any plotp∈ DX, the composite f◦pis inDY. All diﬀeological spaces and smooth
maps form a category Diﬀ. It is worthwhile mentioning that the category Diﬀis
complete, cocomplete and cartesian closed. Moreover, the categ ory of manifolds
embeds into Diﬀ; see also [12, Section 2].
Let{(Xi,Di)}i∈Ibe a family of diﬀeological spaces. Then, the product Π i∈IXi
has a diﬀeology D, called the product diﬀeology , deﬁned to be the set of all maps p:
U→Πi∈IXifrom a domain such that πi◦pare plots of Xifor eachi∈I, whereπi:
Πi∈IXi→Xidenotes the canonical projection. Moreover, for diﬀeological sp aceX
andY, the setF:=C∞(X,Y) of smooth maps from XtoYis endowed with the
functional diﬀeology DFdeﬁned by DF:={p:U→F|Uis domain and ad(p) :
U×X→Yis smooth }, wheread(p) denotes the adjoint to p.
The category Diﬀisrelatedto Topthe categoryoftopologicalspaceswith adjoint
functors. Let Xbe a topological space. Then the continuous diﬀeology is deﬁned
by the family of continuous maps U→Xfrom domains. This yields a functor
C:Top→Diﬀ. For a diﬀeological space ( M,DM), we say that a subset AofMis
D-openif for every plot p∈ DM, the inverse image p−1(A) is an open subset of the
domain ofpequipped with the standard topology. The family of D-open subsets
ofMdeﬁnes a topology of M. Thus, by giving the topology to each diﬀeological
space, we have a functor D:Diﬀ→Topwhich is the left adjoint to C; see [42, 12]ON MULTIPLICATIVE SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR NERVES 23
for more details. The topology for a diﬀeological space Mis called the D-topology
ofM.
For a ﬁnite-dimensional manifold M, the set of all smooth maps from domains to
Mdeﬁne a diﬀeology DM, which is called the standard diﬀeology . Thus, a functor
ℓ:Mfd→Diﬀis deﬁned by ℓ(M) = (M,DM), where Mfdis the category consisting
of ﬁnite-dimensional manifolds and smooth maps. Observe that ℓis a fully faithful
embedding. Moreover, we see that the forgetful functor UfromMfdtoTopfactors
through the category Diﬀ. We summarize the categories and functors mentioned
above with the diagram

Appendix C.C∞(S1,M)versusL∞M
LetMbe a diﬀeological space. We have two free loop spaces ofM. One of them
is the diﬀeological space C∞(S1,M) of smooth maps from the circle S1toMwith
the functional diﬀeology. Another one is the diﬀeological space L∞Mwhich ﬁts in
the pullback diagram
L∞M /d47/d47
/d15/d15M[0,1]
ε0×ε1/d15/d15
M∆/d47/d47M×M(C.1)
inthe category Diﬀ, whereI:= [0,1]isthe diﬀeologicalsubspaceof Rthe Euclidean
space and ∆ denotes the diagonal map. We observe that L∞Mis diﬀeomorphic to
the diﬀeological subspace of MIconsisting of smooth maps γwithγ(0) =γ(1).
Letq:R→S1be the smooth map deﬁned by q(t) =e2π√−1t. Then, the
restriction q:I→S1is smooth. In the category Top, the continuous map q:
I→S1is regarded as a quotient map. The fact enables us to conclude that q26 KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI
induces a weak homotopy equivalence q∗:C0(S1,M)≃w−→LMinTop. We obtain
a diﬀeological version of the equivalence.
In order to deﬁne the weak homotopy equivalence between diﬀeolog ical spaces,
we ﬁrst recall the smooth homotopy groups of a pointed diﬀeologica l space.
We deﬁne an equivalence relation on a diﬀeological space Zbyz≃wif there ex-
istsasmoothpath l:I→Zsuchthatl(0) =zandl(1) =w. LetSnbethen-sphere
endowed with sub-diﬀeology of the manifold Rn+1. We use the north pole ∗as a
base point of Sn. For a pointed diﬀeological space ( X,x0), letC∞((Sn,∗),(X,x0))
be the diﬀeological subspace of the mapping space C∞(Sn,X) consisting of smooth
mapsthat preservebasepoints. Then, givenapositiveinteger n, thenth smooth ho-
motopy group πD
n(X,x0) is deﬁned by the set C∞((Sn,x0),(X.x0))/≃. Moreover,
we deﬁneπD
0(X) byX/≃. We observe that, while the original smooth homotopy
groupπn(X,x0) of a pointed diﬀeological space ( X,x0) due to Iglesias-Zemmour
[22] is deﬁned by using an iterated loop space of X, there is a natural bijection
between the smooth homotopy set πD
n(X,x0) andπn(X,x0); see [13, Theorem 3.2]
for more details.
By deﬁnition, we call a smooth map f:X→YinDiﬀaweak homotopy
equivalence if the induced maps f∗:πD
0(X)→πD
0(Y) andf∗:πD
n(X,x0)→
πD
n(Y,f(x0)) for each nandx0∈Xare bijective.
Lemma C.1. The smooth map q:I→S1mentioned above gives rise to a weak
homotopy equivalence q∗:C∞(S1,M)≃w−→L∞M.
Proof.We prove that the maps ( q∗)∗:π0(C∞(S1,M))→π0(L∞M) and (q∗)∗:
πn(C∞(S1,M),γ0)→πn(L∞M,γ0◦q) induced by qare bijective for n≥1 and
each smooth loop γ0:S1→M. To this end, we ﬁrst show that the adjoint
(1×q)∗:π0({η:N×S1→M|η|∗×S1=γ0})
−→π0({η′:N×I→M|η′|∗×I=γ0◦q,η′|N×{0}=η′|N×{1}})
is bijective, where N=Snforn≥1. In what follows, we use the same notation
for a homotopy class and its representative.
We consider a function /tildewideρ: (−1−2ε,1 + 2ε)→Iwith/tildewideρ(t) = 0 fort∈(−1−
2ε,−1+2ε)∪[0,2ε) and/tildewideρ(t) = 1 fort∈(−2ε,0)∪(1−2ε,1+2ε) for a suﬃciently
small positive number ε. Let (U,ϕU) and (V,ϕV) be local coordinates of S1which
satisfy the condition that ϕ−1
U=q,U′:=ϕU(U) = (−1
4−ε,1
4+ε),ϕ−1
V=qand
V′:=ϕV(V) = (1
4−ε,3
4+ε).
We deﬁne a smooth path /tildewideγ0:S1→Mby/tildewideγ0|U:=γ0◦q◦/tildewideρ◦ϕUand/tildewideγ0|V:=
γ0◦q◦/tildewideρ◦ϕV. By using the map /tildewideρ, we have a smooth map ρ: (−1−2ε,1+2ε)→
(−1−2ε,1 + 2ε) deﬁned by ρ(t) =/tildewideρ(t)−1 fort∈(−1−2ε,0) andρ(t) =/tildewideρ(t)
fort∈[0,1+ 2ε). Since the map ρis smooth homotopic to the identity map on
(−1−2ε,1 + 2ε) andq◦/tildewideρ=q◦ρ, it follows that γ0is smooth homotopic to
/tildewideγ0. Therefore, in order to prove the bijectivity of (1 ×q)∗, it suﬃces to show the
bijectivity for /tildewideγ0instead ofγ0. In what follows, we write γ0for/tildewideγ0. LetAandB
be the domain and codomain of the map (1 ×q)∗, respectively.
We show the surjectivity of (1 ×q)∗. Letη′be an element in B. We consider
a functionρ: (−1−ε,1+ε)→Iwithρ(t) = 0 fort∈[−1−ε,−1+ε)∪[0,ε),
ρ(t) = 1 fort∈(−ε,0)∪[1−ε,1+ε],ρ(t) =tfort∈[2ε,1−2ε] andρ(t) =t+1 for
t∈[−1+2ε,−2ε]. Observe that ρis smooth except for the point 0. We deﬁne map
η:N×S1→Mbyη|N×U=η′◦(1×ρ)◦(1×ϕU) andη|N×V=η′◦(1×ρ)◦(1×ϕV).ON MULTIPLICATIVE SPECTRAL SEQUENCES FOR NERVES 27
Sinceηis constant in a neighborhood of zero, it follows that the map is a well-
deﬁned smooth map. Moreover, we see that η|∗×U=η′◦(1×ρ)◦(1×ϕU) =
γ0◦q◦ρ◦ϕU=γ0|U. The last equality follows from the fact that /tildewideρ◦ρ=/tildewideρonU′.
The same argument as above yields that η|∗×V=γ0|V. Thus, we have η|∗×S1=γ0.
Moreover, we see that η◦(1×q) =η′◦(1×ρ). Extending ρ|[0,1], we deﬁne a
smooth map ρ′:R→Rso thatρ′|[1,∞)= 1 andρ′|(−∞,0]= 0. Deﬁne a smooth
/hatwideρ:R×R→Rby/hatwideρ(t,s) = (1−s)ρ′(t) +st. Then the restriction /hatwideρ:I×I→I
gives rise to a smooth homotopy between ρand the identity on I. It follows that
(1×q)∗(η) =η′◦(1×ρ)∼η′with the smooth homotopy η′◦(1×/hatwideρ). We conclude
that the map (1 ×q)∗is surjective.
Letη0andη1be elements in Awith (1×q)∗(η0) = (1×q)∗(η1). Then, there
exists a smooth path from η0◦(1×q) toη1◦(1×q). LetH: (N×I)×I→M
be the smooth homotopy which is the adjoint to the path. We deﬁne a map/tildewideH:
(N×S1)×I→Mby/tildewideH|N×W×I=H◦(1×ρ×1)◦(1×ϕW×1) forW=U
andV, respectively. We see that /tildewideHis a well-deﬁned smooth map that satisﬁes the
condition that /tildewideH(∗,t,s) =γ0(t). We deﬁne a smooth map ρ′′: (−1−ε,1+ε)→R
byρ′′|(−1−ε,0]=ρ|(−1−ε,0]−1 andρ′′|[0,1+ε)=ρ|[0,1+ε). Then, it follows that
q◦ρ=q◦ρ′′. Moreover, we deﬁne a smooth homotopy ρs: (−1−ε,1+ε)×I→I
byρs(t) = (1−s)ρ′′(t) +st. Then the map ρsgives rise to smooth homotopies
/tildewideHi∼ηifori= 0 and 1. In fact, for example, we see that
/tildewideH0|N×U=H0◦(1×ρ)◦(1×ϕU) =η0◦(1×q)◦(1×ρ)◦(1×ϕU)
=η0◦(1×π)◦(1×ρ)◦(1×ϕU) =η0◦(1×q)◦(1×ρ0)◦(1×ϕU)
∼η0◦(1×q)◦(1×ρ1)◦(1×ϕU) =η0|N×U,
whereπ:R→S1denotes the natural smooth extension of q. It turns out that
η1=η0inA. We observe that the homotopy induced by ρsﬁxes the path γ0.
The same argument as above enables us to prove that q∗:π0(C∞(S1,M))→
π0(L∞M) is a bijection. We have the result. /square
