Abstract. We introduce and study the family of uniformly super McDuﬀ II 1factors. This family
is shown to be closed under elementary equivalence and also c oincides with the family of II 1factors
with the Brown property introduced in [AGE22]. We show that a certain family of existentially
closed factors, the so-called inﬁnitely generic factors, a re uniformly super McDuﬀ, thereby improving
a recent result of [CDI22]. We also show that Popa’s family of strongly McDuﬀ II 1factors are
uniformly super McDuﬀ. Lastly, we investigate when ﬁnitely generic II 1factors are uniformly super
McDuﬀ.
1.Introduction
The study of central sequences in II 1factors has been a central theme in operator algebras since
the days of Murray and von Neumann, who introduced in [MN43] t he notion of Property Gamma
which states that nontrivial central sequences exist and wh ich can be used to distinguish the hy-
perﬁnite II 1factor from the free group factor L(F2). McDuﬀ [McD69] leveraged the property of
having abundantly many central sequences to construct cont inuum many non-isomorphic separable
II1factors, settling a fundamental question open since the inc eption of the subject. In [McD70],
McDuﬀ showed that the central sequence algebra being noncom mutative is equivalent to tensorially
absorbing the hyperﬁnite II 1factor; ever since then, this strengthening of property Gam ma has
been called the McDuﬀ property and has been of great conceptu al importance in the subject.
The model theory of II 1factors, initiated in [FHS13; FHS14a; FHS14b], has since be en an active area
of research in operator algebra theory (for a recent survey s ee [GH22] and the references therein).
Among the various insights that model theory oﬀers is in the a nalysis of ultrapowers; since the
central sequences can be viewed as simply the commutant of th e diagonal embedding of a II 1factor
Minto its ultrapower MU, model theory is especially suited for studying central seq uence algebras.
(Throughout this introduction, all ultraﬁlters are assume d to be nonprincipal ultraﬁlters on N). One
of the main avenues of research in the model theory of II 1factors is to determine when two II 1factors
MandNelementarily equivalent, denoted M≡N, which, assuming the continuum hypothesis,
is equivalent to asking if there exixts an ultraﬁlter Usuch that the ultrapowers MUandNUare
isomorphic. (In general, in this paper we assume the continu um hypothesis in order to be able to
state such algebraic characterizations of model-theoreti c properties.) The classiﬁcation of II 1factors
up to elementary equivalence turns out to be much more challe nging than the classiﬁcation up to
isomorphism (for instance, there are continuum many non-is omorphic separable II 1factors that
are elementarily equivalent to a given II 1factor [FHS14b, Theorem 4.3]). The central sequences
algebra has again played a crucial role in the elementary equ ivalence problem. Indeed, the ﬁrst

handful of examples of non-elementarily equivalent II 1factors (see [FHS14b; FGL06; DL69; Zel69;
GH17]) and the ﬁrst family of continuum many non-elementari ly equivalent II 1factors (interestingly
coinciding with McDuﬀ’s factors; see [BCI17]) pivotally use the structure of the central sequence
algebra as the invariant (see also [CIE22], which exhibits t wo non-elementarily equivalent II 1factors
without central sequences). Despite these results, it rema ins a challenging problem to further the
classiﬁcation up to elementary equivalence of II 1factors with central sequences.
In this paper, we study this problem by identifying a proper s ubfamily of McDuﬀ II 1factors that are
stable under elementary equivalence which we call uniformly super McDuﬀ factors. The motivation
for the terminology arises from [GH17], which introduced th e super McDuﬀ property, which is the
property of admitting a II 1factorial central sequence algebra and which has been of rec ent interest
in the model theory of von Neumann algebras (see for instance [IS21; Mar18; AGE22; GH20a;
CDI22]). To see the various examples and relationships betw een the super McDuﬀ property and
other subclasses of property Gamma factors, we direct the re ader to [AGE22, Section 6.4]. This
paper introduces a uniform version of a ﬁnitary reformulati on of the aforementioned super McDuﬀ
property, which we call the uniform super McDuﬀ property .
Deﬁnition. The McDuﬀ II 1factorMisuniformly super McDuﬀ if for alln≥1, there ism≥1
such that: for all F⊆(M)1with|F| ≤n, there isG⊆(M)1with|G| ≤mfor which, given any
(p,q)∈ P2(M)with

m,
there isu∈U(M)with/bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2<1
nandmaxx∈F/bardbl[x,u]/bardbl2<1
n.
As a ﬁrst remark, we recall a notion ﬁrst introduced in [AGE22 ] and studied there in connection
with proving a generalized version of a key result of Jung [Ju n07] (see also [AK21]).
Deﬁnition. A separable II 1factorMhas the Brown property if for every separable subfactor
N⊆MU, there is a separable subfactor N⊆P⊆MUwithP′∩MUa II1factor.
Recalling that we are assuming the continuum hypothesis, an y two nonprincipal ultrapowers of M
are isomorphic, implying that the deﬁnition of the Brown prop erty is independent of the choice of
ultraﬁlter. Similarly, one sees that if Mhas the Brown property and Nis elementarily equivalent to
M, thenNalso has the Brown property. Our ﬁrst main result shows that th e uniform super McDuﬀ
property is closed under elementary equivalence and in fact coincides with the Brown property:
Theorem A. For a II 1factorM, the following are equivalent:
(1)Mis uniformly super McDuﬀ.
(2) EveryN≡Mis uniformly super McDuﬀ.
(3) EveryN≡Mis super McDuﬀ.
(4)MUis super McDuﬀ for every nonprincipal ultraﬁlter UonN.
(5)MUis super McDuﬀ for some nonprincipal ultraﬁlter UonN.
(6) Every separable N≡Mis super McDuﬀ.
(7)Mhas the Brown property.
We then proceed to show that two particular families of super McDuﬀ II 1factors are in fact uniformly
super McDuﬀ (and hence also have the Brown property):UNIFORMLY SUPER MCDUFF II 1FACTORS 3
Theorem B. Any II 1factor that is elementarily equivalent to any of following s eparable II 1factors
is uniformly super McDuﬀ:
(1) An inﬁnitely generic II1factor.
(2)N⊗RwhereNis a separable full (that is, non-Gamma) II 1factor.
The ﬁrst family is a certain subclass of the family of existen tially closed factors (see [Far+16]) arising
in the model theory of II 1factors. Our result for this case improves upon the work of [C DI22], where
it was shown that inﬁnitely generic II 1factors are super McDuﬀ. Note that our result also obtains
uniform super McDuﬀness for factors elementarily equivale nt to inﬁnitely generic factors, some of
which are not inﬁnitely generic themselves (see Lemma 2.4).
The second family of factors in the above list are usually ref erred to as strongly McDuﬀ factors
and were ﬁrst considered by Popa in [Pop12]. Strongly McDuﬀ I I1factors were shown to be super
McDuﬀ in [AGE22, Proposition 6.1.5].
Theorems A and B produce several new concrete examples of fac tors with the Brown property.
Indeed, before this work, the only known examples of II 1factors with the Brown property were
those factors elementarily equivalent to R[AGE22; GH20a], which do not fall into either of the two
categories in the above theorem.
Having proven that the inﬁnitely generic factors have the un iform super McDuﬀ property, it is
natural to inquire whether another important subclass of th e existentially closed factors, namely
the ﬁnitely generic factors, have this property. Here, a thi rd property, which we call the (T)-factorial
relative commutant property, or (T)-FRC property, becomes relevant. We say that a separable II 1
factorMhas the (T)-FRC property if and only if every separable II 1factor with property
(T) embeds into MUwith factorial relative commutant. We show below that this p roperty is an
axiomatizable property of separable II 1factors. In [Gol20], it was shown that the inﬁnitely generic
factors have the (T)-FRC property. Here, we connect the ques tion of whether or not ﬁnitely generic
factors have the (T)-FRC property and whether or not they are uniformly super McDuﬀ:
Theorem C. If the ﬁnitely generic factors have the (T)-FRC property, th en they are also uniformly
super McDuﬀ.
We end this introduction by stating the main open question in connection to our work:
Question D. Is the class of II 1factors with the super McDuﬀ property closed under elementa ry
equivalence? Equivalently, do the classes of super McDuﬀ an d uniformly super McDuﬀ factors
coincide?
Organization of the paper. In Section 2, we recall some background on the model theory of
tracial von Neumann algebras, including a discussion of the classes of existentially closed, inﬁnitely
generic, and ﬁnitely generic factors. For a more detailed ba ckground on related matters, we direct the
reader to [AGE22, Section 2]. Section 3 is where the uniform s uper McDuﬀ property is introduced
and Theorem A is proved. Section 4 proves Theorem B via a uniﬁe d approach involving a certain
spectral gap criterion. In Section 5, Theorem C is proved and various remarks surrounding the
problem of whether ﬁnitely generic II 1factors are uniformly super McDuﬀ are documented.

2.Preliminaries
2.1.Existentially closed, inﬁnitely generic, and ﬁnitely gene ric factors.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A separable tracial von Neumann algebra Mis said to be existentially closed
(e.c.) if: for any tracial von Neumann algebra NcontainingM, there is an embedding N ֒→MU
that restricts to the diagonal embedding M ֒→MU.
The deﬁnition given above is the semantic deﬁnition and uses the separability assumption on M.
The syntactic deﬁnition, which makes no separability assum ption, reads: Mis e.c. if and only if,
for every tracial von Neumann algebra NextendingMand every quantiﬁer-free formula ϕ(x)with
parameters from M, we have
inf{ϕ(a)M:a∈M}= inf{ϕ(b)N:b∈N}.
E.c. tracial von Neumann algebras are McDuﬀ II 1factors (see, for example, [GHS13, Section 2]); for
this reason, we often refer to e.c. tracial von Neumann algeb ras as e.c. II 1factors. Moreover, the class
of e.c. tracial von Neumann algebras is embedding universal , meaning that every separable II 1
factor is contained in a separable e.c. II 1factor. (This is a special case of a general model-theoretic
fact; see [CK13, Lemma 3.5.7] for a proof in classical logic. )
Before moving on, we make a short digression to point out some f acts about e.c. factors that follow
from the results of [AGE22] but were not explicitly pointed o ut there. In [AGE22, Question 6.3.1],
it was asked whether or not every e.c. factor is super McDuﬀ. T he following yields a criterion for
when an e.c. factor is super McDuﬀ:
Theorem 2.2. For an e.c. factor M, the following are equivalent:
(1)Mis super McDuﬀ.
(2) For any e.c. factor NwithM⊆N, we have that M′∩NUis a factor.
(3) There is an e.c. factor NwithM⊆Nfor whichM′∩NUis a factor.
Proof. For the implication (1) implies (2), suppose that Mis super McDuﬀ and Nis an e.c. factor
withM⊆N. By considering the chain M⊆MU⊆NU, we see that M′∩NUis a factor using
[AGE22, Theorem 7.15(2), Lemma 7.2.1, and Lemma 7.2.8].
The implication (2) implies (3) is trivial. For the implicat ion (3) implies (1), suppose that Nis e.c.,
M⊆N, andM′∩NUis a factor. We then have that M⊆MUis a factor using [AGE22, Theorem
7.1.5(1) and Lemma 7.2.1]. /square
In [AGE22, Question 6.3.10], it was asked if a union of a chain of super McDuﬀ factors is once again
super McDuﬀ. Using Theorem 2.2, we can show that the answer to this question is positive if all of
the super McDuﬀ factors in the chain are also e.c. (which is a s trenthening of [AGE22, Proposition
6.3.17]):
Corollary 2.3. Any union of a chain of e.c. super McDuﬀ factors is (e.c.) supe r McDuﬀ.
We now return to the main thread of this section. In this paper , we will be concerned with speciﬁc
subclasses of the class of e.c. factors. We ﬁrst consider the class of inﬁnitely generic factors ,
which is deﬁned to be the largest class of II 1factors that is embedding universal and which isUNIFORMLY SUPER MCDUFF II 1FACTORS 5
model-complete , meaning any embedding i:M ֒→Nbetween two inﬁnitely generic factors is
elementary, that is, extends to an isomorphism MU→NU. (The existence of such a class follows
from [Far+16, Corollary 5.15]. The terminology inﬁnitely g eneric refers to the use of so-called inﬁnite
model-theoretic forcing in the construction of these facto rs; see [Far+16, Section 5].) It follows from
[Far+16, Lemma 5.20] that any two inﬁnitely generic II 1factors are elementarily equivalent. That
inﬁnitely generic factors are e.c. follows from [Far+16, Pr oposition 5.11].
In connection with Theorem 4.13 below, we need to record the f ollowing:
Lemma 2.4. There is a II 1factorMthat is elementarily equivalent to the inﬁnitely generic fa ctors
but is not itself inﬁnitely generic.
Proof. LetT∗denote the common theory of the inﬁnitely generic factors. I f the statement of the
lemma is false, then the models of T∗are precisely the inﬁnitely generic factors themselves. Si nce
the collection of inﬁnitely generic factors is embedding un iversal and model-complete, it follows that
T∗is the model companion of the theory of tracial von Neumann al gebras, contradicting the main
result of [GHS13]. /square
The other class of e.c. factors we will need to consider are th eﬁnitely generic factors . Any
deﬁnition of these factors involves a discussion of ﬁnite mo del-theoretic forcing (see, for example,
[Far+16, Section 6] or [Gol21, Section 3]). However, for our purposes, we will only need to know
the following two properties of a ﬁnitely generic factor N(besides their existence):
•Nislocally universal , meaning that every separable II 1factor admits an embedding into
NU;
•Nhas the generalized Jung property , meaning that every embedding N ֒→NUis
elementary.
The ﬁrst item follows from [Gol21, Propositions 2.10 and 3.9 ] and the fact that e.c. models of
theories with the joint embedding property are locally univ ersal (see [Gol21, Subsection 1.1]). The
second item follows from [Gol21, Proposition 3.10].
Whether these two properties actually characterize being ﬁ nitely generic is an open problem (see
[AGE22, Question 3.3.8.]).
It follows immediately from these two properties that any ﬁn itely generic factor is e.c. It is unknown
whether or not the theories of ﬁnitely generic and inﬁnitely generic II 1factors coincide, or equiva-
lently, whether or not any ﬁnitely generic factor must be inﬁ nitely generic. (In general, there need
not be any connection between the ﬁnitely generic and inﬁnit ely generic models of a given theory.)
2.2.Deﬁnability. We freely use the terminology around deﬁnability adopted in [Gol18]. Through-
out this subsection, Tdenotes the theory of tracial von Neumann algebras in the app ropriate con-
tinuous signature.
For a tracial von Neumann algebra M, we letP2(M)denote the set of pairs of projections from
Mof the same trace. The relevance of the set P2(M)is thatMis a factor if and only if, for any
(p,q)∈ P2(M), there is a unitary u∈Mwithupu∗=q.
The assignment M/ma√sto→ P2(M)is aT-functor which is the zeroset of the T-formula
ξ(p,q) := max( /bardblp∗−p/bardbl2,/bardblp2−p/bardbl2,/bardblq∗−q/bardbl2,/bardblq2−q/bardbl2,|τ(p)−τ(q)|).6 GOLDBRING, JEKEL, KUNNAWALKAM ELAYAVALLI, AND PI
Moreover, an easy functional calculus argument shows that
P2/parenleftBigg/productdisplay
UMi/parenrightBigg
=/productdisplay
UP2(Mi)
for all families (Mi)i∈Iof tracial von Neumann algebras and all ultraﬁlters UonI, whence P2is a
T-deﬁnable set by [Gol18, Theorem 2.13] .
Consequently, for any T-formulaϕ(p,q,/vector z), theT-functorsup(p,q)∈P2ϕ(p,q,/vector z)is aT-formula. It will
behoove us to understand the relationship between the quant iﬁer-complexity of sup(p,q)∈P2ϕ(p,q,/vector z)
and ofϕ(p,q,/vector z)itself. To understand this relationship, we ﬁrst note that, asT-formulae, one has
sup
(p,q)∈P2ϕ(p,q,/vector z) = sup
/vector x(ϕ(/vector x,/vector z).−α(d(/vector x,P2)),
whereα: [0,1]→[0,1]is an increasing continuous function with α(0) = 0 satisfying
|ϕ(/vector x,/vector z)−ϕ(/vector y,/vector z)| ≤α(d(/vector x,/vector y))
for all tuples /vector x,/vector y,/vector zin models of T. Sinceξis quantiﬁer-free, one can show that d(/vector x,P2)is
T-equivalent to an existential formula (see [GH20b, Section 2], whence so is α(d(/vector x,P2))asαis
increasing. As a result, if ϕ(p,q,/vector z)is∀n(resp.∃n), then the sup(p,q)∈P2ϕ(p,q,/vector z)is∀n(resp.∀n+1).
We will also ﬁnd the need to take the inﬁmum over the T-deﬁnable set Uof unitaries, which is the
zeroset of the T-formula
υ(u) = max( /bardblu∗u−1/bardbl2,/bardbluu∗−1/bardbl2).
In this case, for any T-formulaϕ(u,/vector z), there is a continuous function γsuch that, as T-formulas,
we have
inf
u∈Uϕ(u,/vector z) = inf
x(ϕ(x,/vector z)+γ(υ(x))
(see the proof of [Gol18, Theorem 2.13]). As a result, if ϕ(u,/vector z)is∀n(resp.∃n), theninfu∈Uϕ(u,/vector z)
is∃n+1(resp.∃n).
3.The uniform super McDuff property
The following is a ﬁnitary (ultraproduct-free) reformulat ion of having factorial relative commutant:
Proposition 3.1. IfMis a separable II 1factor, then M′∩MUis a factor if and only if: for
everyǫ >0and every ﬁnite F⊆(M)1, there are δ >0and ﬁniteG⊆(M)1such that: for
all(p,q)∈ P2(M), if/bardbl[x,p]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,q]/bardbl2< δfor allx∈G, then there is u∈U(M)such that
/bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2<ǫand/bardbl[x,u]/bardbl2<ǫfor allx∈F.
Proof. First suppose that M′∩MUis a factor and yet, towards a contradiction, the condition f ails
for a particular ǫandF. Let(Gn)denote a sequence of ﬁnite subsets of (M)1whose union is
SOT-dense in (M)1. Then by the contradiction assumption, for each n≥1, there are projections
(pn,qn)∈ P2(M)witnessing that δ=1
nandG=Gndo not satisfy the conclusion of the forward
direction for this particular choice of ǫandF. Setp= (pn)Uandq= (qn)U. Note then that
(p,q)∈ P2(M′∩MU). SinceMis super McDuﬀ, there is u∈U(M′∩MU)such thatupu∗=q.
Consequently, for U-almost all n, we have that /bardblunpnu∗
n−qn/bardbl2< ǫandmaxx∈F/bardbl[x,un]/bardbl2< ǫ, a
contradiction to the choice of (pn,qn).UNIFORMLY SUPER MCDUFF II 1FACTORS 7
For the converse direction, suppose the condition holds. Fi x(p,q)∈ P2(M′∩MU); we aim to show
thatpandqare unitarily conjugate in M′∩MU. By saturation, it suﬃces to show that, for each ǫ>0
and ﬁniteF⊆(M)1, there isu∈U(MU)such that /bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2≤ǫandmaxx∈F/bardbl[x,u]/bardbl2≤ǫ. Let
δandGbe as in the condition for ǫandF. Writep= (pn)Uandq= (qn)Uwith(pn,qn)∈ P2(M)
for alln∈N. Note that, for U-almost all n, we have maxx∈Gmax(/bardbl[x,pn]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,qn]/bardbl2)< δ.
Consequently, for these n, there isun∈U(M)such that /bardblunpnu∗
n−qn/bardbl2<ǫandmaxx∈F/bardbl[x,un]/bardbl2<
ǫ. Letu= (un)U∈U(MU). Then/bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2≤ǫandmaxx∈F/bardbl[x,u]/bardbl2≤ǫ, as desired. /square
Remark 3.2. While the original deﬁnition of super McDuﬀ was only for sepa rable II 1factors, we
can use the ﬁnitary criterion appearing in Proposition 3.1 t o give a deﬁnition of super McDuﬀness
for arbitrary II 1factors (using also that there is a ﬁnitary deﬁnition of McDu ﬀness that makes sense
for arbitrary tracial von Neumann algebras; see [FHS14b, Pr oposition 3.9]).
The condition in Proposition 3.1 lends itself naturally to a uniform version, namely that, in the
criterion of Proposition 3.1, both δand the size of Gmay be taken to depend only on ǫand the size
ofF. Said somewhat diﬀerently:
Deﬁnition 3.3. The McDuﬀ II 1factorMisuniformly super McDuﬀ if and only if, for all
n≥1, there ism≥1such that: for all F⊆(M)1with|F| ≤n, there isG⊆(M)1with|G| ≤m
for which, given any (p,q)∈ P2(M)with
max
x∈Gmax(/bardbl[x,p]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,q]/bardbl2)<1
m,
there isu∈U(M)with/bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2<1
nandmaxx∈F/bardbl[x,u]/bardbl2<1
n.
Remark 3.4. Note that the uniformity condition described in the previou s deﬁnition is automatic
in the case that Mdoes not have property Gamma. Indeed, in this situation, giv enn≥1, there is a
ﬁnite subset K⊆(M)1andm≥1such that, for all contractions x∈M, ifmaxy∈K/bardbl[x,y]/bardbl2<1
m,
thend(x,C)<1
2n. Consequently, if (p,q)∈ P2(M)are such that maxy∈Kmax(/bardbl[p,y]/bardbl2,/bardbl[q,y]/bardbl2)<
1
m, thend(p,C),d(q,C)<1
2n, whence /bardblp−q/bardbl2<1
nand we may take u= 1in the above deﬁnition.
Now we are ready to prove that the Brown property is equivalent to the uniform super McDuﬀ
property, as well as several other conditions:
Theorem 3.5. For a II 1factorM, the following are equivalent:
(1)Mis uniformly super McDuﬀ.
(2) EveryN≡Mis uniformly super McDuﬀ.
(3) EveryN≡Mis super McDuﬀ.
(4)MUis super McDuﬀ for every nonprincipal ultraﬁlter UonN.
(5)MUis super McDuﬀ for some nonprincipal ultraﬁlter UonN.
(6) Every separable N≡Mis super McDuﬀ.
(7)Mhas the Brown property.
Proof. (1) implies (2): Suppose that Mis uniformly super McDuﬀ. Fix n≥1and take the
corresponding m≥1as in the deﬁnition of uniformly super McDuﬀ. Consider the se ntenceσn,m=
supx1,...,xninfy1...,ymsup(p,q)∈P2ϕn,m(/vector x,/vector y,p,q), whereϕn,m(/vector x,/vector y,p,q)is the following formula:8 GOLDBRING, JEKEL, KUNNAWALKAM ELAYAVALLI, AND PI

ThenσM

we claim that δ:=1

sup(p,q)∈P2ϕn,m(/vector x,/vector y,p,q)<η. Now suppose that (p,q)∈ P2(N)is such that
max
j=1,...,mmax(/bardbl[p,yj]/bardbl2,/bardbl[q,yj]/bardbl2)<1
m−η.
It follows that the ﬁrst entry of ϕn,m(/vector x,/vector y,p,q)is greater than η, whence the second entry is smaller
thanη. Consequently, there is a unitary which conjugates pto within1
n+η <2

The implications (2) implies (3), (3) implies (4), and (4) im plies (5) are all trivial. To see that
(5) implies (6), assume that MUis super McDuﬀ and ﬁx a separable N≡M. By considering an
elementary embedding N ֒→MU, we may assume that Nis an elementary substructure of MU.
Fixn≥1and ﬁnitely many x1,...,x n∈N. SinceMUis super McDuﬀ, we get a corresponding
δ >0and ﬁniteG⊆(MU)1. Ifm≥1
δandG={y1,...,ym}(possibly with repetitions), we have
that(sup(p,q)∈P2ϕn,m(/vector x,/vector y,p,q))MU= 0, whereϕn,mis as in the implication (1) implies (2). Since
Nis an elementary substructure of MU, it follows that

nandx1,...,x n. It follows that
(sup(p,q)∈P2ϕn,m(/vector x,/vector y,p,q))N= 0. By elementarity, we have that (sup(p,q)∈P2ϕn,m(/vector x,/vector y,p,q))MU=

(4) implies (1): Suppose, towards a contradiction, that Mis not uniformly super McDuﬀ. Then

Consequently, for each m≥1, there arexm

Remark 3.6. By the comments made at the end of Subsection 2.2, we see that th e sentences
appearing in the above proof are ∀4-sentences. The quantiﬁer-complexity of these concrete se ntences
agrees with the fact established in [GH20a], proven using Eh renfeucht-Fraïsse games, that any II 1
factor with the same four quantiﬁer theory as a II 1factor with the Brown property also has the
Brown property.
SinceRhas the Brown property, by Theorem 3.5, we know that Ris uniformly super McDuﬀ. In
Subsection 4.3 below, we will give a direct argument that Ris uniformly super McDuﬀ.
4.Spectral gap and the uniform super McDuff property
In this section, we describe a suﬃcient condition for the uni form super McDuﬀ property in terms
of spectral gap, and deduce that inﬁnitely generic II 1factors and strongly McDuﬀ II 1factors are
both uniformly super McDuﬀ.
4.1.Spectral gap criterion. We begin by recalling the deﬁnition of spectral gap for a suba lgebra
of a tracial factor.
Deﬁnition 4.1. LetMbe a tracial factor and A⊆Ma von Neumann subalgebra. Then A⊆M
hasspectral gap if there exists a ﬁnite F⊆(A)1and a constant C >0such that, for all ξ∈L2(M),
we have
/bardblξ−EA′∩M(ξ)/bardbl2
2≤C/summationdisplay
x∈F/bardblxξ−ξx/bardbl2
2.
If, in addition, |F| ≤C, then we call Caspectral gap number forA⊆M. We let SG(A,M)
denote the smallest spectral gap number for AinsideM. We also write SG(M) = SG(M,M).
Remark 4.2. In particular, M⊆Mhas spectral gap if there exists a ﬁnite F⊆(M)1and a
constantC >0such that, for all ξ∈L2(M), we have
/bardblξ−τ(ξ)·1/bardbl2
2≤C/summationdisplay
x∈F/bardblxξ−ξx/bardbl2
2.
Connes showed in [Con76, Theorem 2.1] that a tracial factor M⊆Mhas spectral gap if and only
ifMis full (equivalently Mdoes not have property Gamma in the case of a II 1factor).
For a tracial von Neumann algebra M, subsetsX,Y⊆M, andǫ >0, we writeX⊆ǫYto mean
that every element of Xis withinǫ(with respect to the 2-norm) of some element of Y.
Deﬁnition 4.3. We say that a tracial factor Mhas the factorial commutant limit spectral
gap property orFC limit spectral gap property if there exists some constant s>0such that,
for any ﬁnite F⊆Mandǫ>0, there is some von Neumann subalgebra A⊆Msuch thatA′∩M
is a factor, SG(A,M)≤s, andF⊆ǫA.10 GOLDBRING, JEKEL, KUNNAWALKAM ELAYAVALLI, AND PI
The following proposition provides a suﬃcient criterion fo r a McDuﬀ II 1factor to be uniformly
super McDuﬀ:
Proposition 4.4. IfMis a McDuﬀ II 1factor with the FC limit spectral gap property, then Mis
uniformly super McDuﬀ.
Proof. Fixn≥1. We claim that any m >24snwitnesses that Mis uniformly super McDuﬀ.
Towards that end, ﬁx F⊆(M)1with|F| ≤n. ChooseA⊆Msuch thatA′∩Mis a factor,
SG(A,M)≤s, andFis contained in the (1/2n)-neighborhood of A. Then there exists G⊆(A)1
such that |G| ≤sand

In particular, if (p,q)∈ P2(M)andmaxx∈Gmax(/bardbl[x,p]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,q]/bardbl2)≤1/m, then

6s/m. Similarly, there is a projection ˜q∈A′∩Msuch that /bardbl˜q−q/bardbl2<6s/m.
Next notice that |τ(˜p)−τ(˜q)| ≤12s/m. SinceA′∩Mis a factor, there exists a unitary uinA′∩M
such thatu˜pu∗−˜qis plus or minus a projection of trace <12s/m. In particular, /bardblu˜pu∗−˜q/bardbl2<
12s/m, which implies /bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2<24s/m<1/n.
Moreover, since we assumed that Fis contained in the (1/2n)-neighborhood of Aandubelongs to
A′∩M, we have that /bardbl[u,x]/bardbl2<1/nforx∈F. Finally, note that |G| ≤s≤24sn<m , ﬁnishing
the proof. /square
Remark 4.5. It is interesting to note that in the previous proof, the size ofGonly depends on the
constantsand does not depend on n.
4.2.Inﬁnitely generic factors are uniformly super McDuﬀ. In this section, we use Propo-
sition 4.4 to show that inﬁnitely generic factors are unifor mly super McDuﬀ. This result improves
the result of Chifan, Drimbe, and Ioana from [CDI22] showing that inﬁnitely generic factors are
super McDuﬀ. A main ingredient in the proof of the latter resu lt is the embedding universality of
property (T) factors, also proved in [CDI22]. Our proof in th is subsection also utilizes this fact (and
its proof).
Recall that a II 1factorNhasproperty (T) if there is a ﬁnite F⊆Nandδ >0such that,
whenever His a normal N-Nbimodule with a unit vector v∈ Hsatisfying maxx∈F/bardblxξ−ξx/bardbl<δ,
then there is a nonzero vector η∈ Hsuch thatxη=ηxfor allx∈N. IfΓis an ICC group, then
L(Γ)has property (T) if and only if Γhas property (T). Connes and Jones [CJ85] also showed that
property (T) for factors is equivalent to the following, see mingly stronger, property.
Theorem 4.6. A II1factor has property (T) if and only if there is a ﬁnite subset F⊆N(called a
Kazhdan set ) and a constant K >0such that, for every normal N-Nbimodule H, we have
/bardblξ−Pcentral(ξ)/bardbl2
H≤K/summationdisplay
x∈F/bardblxξ−ξx/bardbl2
H,
wherePcentral is the projection onto the subspace of central vectors in H.UNIFORMLY SUPER MCDUFF II 1FACTORS 11
In particular, if N⊆Mis an inclusion of II 1factors and Nhas property (T), then L2(M)is a
normalN-N-bimodule and therefore Nhas spectral gap inside M. Moreover, Tan [Tan22] showed
the converse implication, namely that if a II 1factorNhas spectral gap in Mfor every inclusion
N⊆M, thenNhas property (T). Hence, it is natural to leverage property ( T) subalgebras of M
together with our spectral gap criterion for the uniform sup er McDuﬀ property.
Parallel to the spectral gap number in the previous section, we introduce the following notion.
Deﬁnition 4.7. We say that Kis aKazhdan number for a II 1factorNwith property (T) if
there exists a ﬁnite F⊆(N)1with|F| ≤Ksuch that for every normal N-N-bimodule H,
/bardblξ−Pcentral(ξ)/bardbl2
H≤K/summationdisplay
x∈F/bardblxξ−ξx/bardbl2
H.
We denote by K(N)the smallest possible Kazhdan number for N.
Observe that if Nis a II 1factor with property (T) and N⊆Mis an inclusion of tracial von
Neumann algebras, then SG(N,M)≤K(N).
Deﬁnition 4.8. We say that a II 1factorMhas the uniform local property (T) if there exists
some constant ssuch that, for any ﬁnite F⊆Mandǫ >0, there is some II 1factorN⊆Mwith
property (T) such that K(N)≤sandF⊆ǫA.
Proposition 4.9. LetMbe an e.c. II 1factor with the uniform local property (T). Then Mhas the
FC limit spectral gap property, and hence is uniformly super McDuﬀ.
Proof. Letsbe as in the deﬁnition of uniform local property (T). If F⊆Mis a ﬁnite subset, then
there exists some II 1factorN⊆Mwith property (T) such that K(N)≤sandF⊆ǫN. Note
SG(N,M)≤K(N)≤s. Moreover, since Mis e.c. andNhas property (T), it follows that N′∩M
is a factor (see [Gol20, Theorem 2.8]). Hence, Mhas the FC limit spectral gap property. Moreover,
since e.c. II 1factors are McDuﬀ, Proposition 4.4 implies that Mis uniformly super McDuﬀ. /square
Remark 4.10. One can make a similar argument if we drop the uniformity in th e deﬁnition of
uniform local property (T). Say that the II 1factorMhas the local property (T) if: for every
ǫ>0and ﬁniteF⊆M, there is a property (T) subfactor NofMsuch thatF⊆ǫN. Then an e.c.
factorMwith local property (T) will be super McDuﬀ. Indeed, Mcan be written as an inductive
limit of property (T) subfactors Ni; just as in the previous proof, since Mis e.c., each N′
i∩Mis
a factor. This implies that N′
i∩MUis a factor, and therefore M′∩MUis a factor by [AGE22,
Proposition 6.3.12].
Next, we will show that the previous proposition applies to some inﬁnitely generic II 1factors.
Proposition 4.11. There exists an inﬁnitely generic II 1factor with the uniform local property (T).
To prove this, we will use the following Theorem, which is ext racted from the discussion at the end
of the introduction to [CDI22].
Theorem 4.12 ([CDI22]) .There is a ﬁxed countable property (T) group Γsuch that: given any
II1factorM, there is a II 1factorNcontaining Mthat is generated by a group homomorphism
π: Γ→U(N). Consequently, Nhas property (T) and a Kazhdan set for Ncan be taken to be12 GOLDBRING, JEKEL, KUNNAWALKAM ELAYAVALLI, AND PI
the image under πof a Kazhdan set for Γwith associated Kazhdan constant equal to that of Γ. As
a result, the Kazhdan numbers of Nare uniformly bounded (independently of M) by the Kazhdan
numberK(Γ)ofΓ.
Proof of Proposition 4.11. We construct a chain of II 1factors
M0⊆N0⊆M1⊆N1⊆...
inductively as follows. Let M0be an inﬁnitely generic II 1factor. Once Miis chosen, let Nibe a
property (T) factor constructed using Theorem 4.12, whence its Kazhdan number is bounded by
K(Γ). OnceNiis chosen, let Mi+1be an inﬁnitely generic II 1factor containing Ni, which exists
because inﬁnitely generic II 1factors are embedding universal.
LetMbe the inductive limit of the chain. Then Mhas uniform local property (T) by construction.
It is also inﬁnitely generic by [AGE22, Lemma 6.3.16]. /square
Theorem 4.13. Every inﬁnitely generic II 1factor is uniformly super McDuﬀ. Consequently, any
II1factor that is elementarily equivalent to an inﬁnitely gene ric II1factor is uniformly super McDuﬀ.
Proof. As noted in the preliminaries, any two inﬁnitely generic II 1factors are elementarily equiva-
lent. Since the uniform super McDuﬀ property is preserved by elementary equivalence, it suﬃces to
show that some inﬁnitely generic II 1factor is uniformly super McDuﬀ. By Proposition 4.11, there
exists an inﬁnitely generic II 1factor with uniform local property (T), which must be unifor mly
super McDuﬀ by Proposition 4.9. /square
Theorem 4.13 generalizes Chifan, Drimbe, and Ioana’s resul t, which showed that inﬁnitely generic
II1factors are super McDuﬀ [CDI22, Theorem 6.4]. In fact, it is a strict generalization because
there are II 1factors elementarily equivalent to the inﬁnitely generic o nes without themselves being
inﬁnitely generic (Lemma 2.4).
Theorem 4.13 also allows us to connect two open questions dis cussed in Subsection 2.1: whether
every e.c. factor is super McDuﬀ and whether the union of a cha in of super McDuﬀ factors is once
again super McDuﬀ.
Proposition 4.14. If the union of every chain of uniformly super McDuﬀ factors i s (uniformly)
super McDuﬀ, then every e.c. factor is (uniformly) super McD uﬀ.
Proof. LetPbe an e.c. factor and embed Pinto an inﬁnitely generic factor M. By Theorem 4.13,
Mis uniformly super McDuﬀ. Fix an embedding M ֒→PUthat restricts to the diagonal embedding
P ֒→PU. We then have the chain
P⊆M ֒→PU⊆MU֒→P2U⊆M2U···
Note that all the embeddings PkU֒→P(k+1)Uare elementary (being iterated ultrapowers of the
diagonal embedding). Consequently, the limit Qof the chain is an elementary extension of P. Since
Mis uniformly super McDuﬀ and each MkUis elementarily equivalent to M, they are also uniformly
super McDuﬀ. By hypothesis, Qis (uniformly) super McDuﬀ. Since (uniform) super McDuﬀnes s
passes to elementary substructures, the result follows. /squareUNIFORMLY SUPER MCDUFF II 1FACTORS 13
4.3.Strongly McDuﬀ implies uniformly super McDuﬀ. The following result was suggested
to us by Adrian Ioana.
Theorem 4.15. LetMbe a full tracial factor. Then M⊗Rhas the FC limit spectral gap property
and hence is uniformly super McDuﬀ.
In particular, by taking M=C, we obtain a direct argument that Ris uniformly super McDuﬀ
(which was already known because Rhas the Brown property). When Mis a full II 1factor,M⊗R
is often called a strongly McDuﬀ II1factor. Strongly McDuﬀ II 1factors were shown to be super
McDuﬀ in [AGE22, Proposition 6.1.5] and Theorem 4.15 genera lizes this latter result to obtain that
strongly McDuﬀ factors are uniformly super McDuﬀ. As shown i n [AGE22, Proposition 6.3.2], e.c.
factors are never strongly McDuﬀ, whence Theorem 4.15 repre sents a completely diﬀerent class of
examples of uniformly super McDuﬀ factors from the inﬁnitel y generic factors above.
The main ingredient in the proof of Theorem 4.15 is the follow ing result of Hastings on quantum
expanders [Has07]. Here we only state a special case of Hasti ngs’ result; in Hastings’ terminology,
this is the Hermitian case with D= 4.
Theorem 4.16 (Hastings [Has07]) .Fix an even d≥4. There exist unitaries Uk,1, ...,Uk,din
Mk(C)such that the following properties hold: Let Φk:Mk(C)→Mk(C)be deﬁned by

Letλ2(Φk)be the second largest eigenvalue of Φk, which is the largest eigenvalue of Φkon the

For us, the importance of Hastings’ result is the following:
Corollary 4.17. The spectral gap numbers for Mk(C)satisfylimsupk→∞SG(Mk(C))≤8. In
particular, supkSG(Mk(C))<∞.
Proof. Fix an even d≥4(in the end, we will use d= 8), and let Φkbe as in the previous theorem.
By the deﬁnition of λ2(Φk), we have
/bardblX−trk(X)1/bardbl2≤1
1−λ2(Φk)/bardblX−Φk(X)/bardbl2.
We also have

We will also use the following elementary observations abou t spectral gap numbers and tensor
products. These results are known to experts, but we include the proof here for completeness (and
because we pay attention to the spectral gap numbers).
Lemma 4.18. LetMbe a full tracial factor. Then for any tracial von Neumann alg ebraN,M⊗C
has spectral gap inside M⊗N. In fact, if FandCwitness spectral gap for MinsideM, thenF⊗1
andCwitness spectral gap for M⊗CinsideM⊗N. In particular, SG(M,M⊗N)≤SG(M,M).
Proof. LetSbe the operator id−τonL2(M)and letT:L2(M)→L2(M)Fbe the linear map
given byT(ξ) = (xξ−ξx)x∈F. Then the spectral gap property of M⊆Mcan be expressed by
/bardblSξ/bardbl2≤C/bardblTξ/bardbl2forξ∈L2(M),
or equivalently, S∗S≤C·T∗T. Note that L2(M⊗N)∼=L2(M)⊗L2(N)andEC⊗N=τM⊗idL2(N)
as an operator on L2(M)⊗L2(N). SinceS∗S≤C·T∗T, we have
(S⊗idL2(N))∗(S⊗idL2(N))≤C·(T⊗idL2(N))∗(T⊗idL2(N)),
which translates to

Lemma 4.19. LetM1andM2be full tracial factors. Then M1⊗M2is also full. More precisely,
forj= 1,2, letFjandCjwitness the spectral gap of Mj⊆Mj. Then(F1⊗1)∪(1⊗F2)and
max(C1,C2)witness spectral gap for M1⊗M2. Hence, SG(M1⊗M2)≤SG(M1)+SG(M2).

We are now ready to prove Theorem 4.15.
Proof of Theorem 4.15. LetF⊆M⊗ Rbe a ﬁnite subset and let ǫ >0. Sets= SG(M) +
supkSG(Mk(C)). Then there exists some tensor decomposition R=Mk(C)⊗˜Rsuch thatFis
contained in the ǫ-neighborhood of M⊗Mk(C)⊗C. Note also that
(M⊗Mk(C)⊗C)′∩(M⊗R) =C⊗C⊗˜R,
which is a factor. By Lemmas 4.18 and 4.19,
SG(M⊗Mk(C)⊗C,M⊗R)≤SG(M⊗Mk(C))≤SG(M)+SG(Mk(C))≤s.
Therefore,M⊗Rhas the FC limit spectral gap property, as desired. /square
In [AGE22, Proposition 6.1.7], it was shown that an inﬁnite t ensor product of full II 1factors is
super McDuﬀ. It is natural to wonder whether or not there is a u niform version of this result. The
proof of Theorem 4.15 immediately yields the following:

Remark 4.21. It is unknown whether or not there is a uniform bound on the spe ctral gap num-
ber of full II 1factors or, equivalently, whether or not the class of full II 1factors is closed under
ultraproducts. Proposition 4.20 shows that a positive answ er to this question would imply that an
inﬁnite tensor product of full factors is uniformly super Mc Duﬀ. Said diﬀerently, if one can ﬁnd an
example of an inﬁnite tensor product of full II 1factors which is not uniformly super McDuﬀ, then
one can conclude that the spectral gap numbers for full II 1factors is unbounded.
5.Do finitely generic factors have the uniform super McDuff pr operty?
The results concerning the inﬁnitely generic factors above motivate the following questions for the
ﬁnitely generic factors:
Question 5.1. Is there a ﬁnitely generic (uniformly) super McDuﬀ factor? A re all ﬁnitely generic
factors (uniformly) super McDuﬀ?
Remark 5.2. If one restricts to the case of Connes embeddable factors, th enRis the unique ﬁnitely
generic factor (see [AGE22, Corollary 3.2.6]). Let (σn)be a sequence of sentences witnessing that
Ris uniformly super McDuﬀ. By [Gol21, Theorem 2.14 and Proposi tion 3.9], for each n≥1, there
is a unique real number rnsuch thatσM
n=rnin all ﬁnitely generic factors M. Ifrn>0for somen,
then we conclude that the ﬁnitely generic factors are not uni formly super McDuﬀ. This result might
lead to a potentially diﬀerent proof that the Connes Embeddi ng Problem has a negative solution
(see [Ji+21]).
5.1.A suﬃcient criterion for ﬁnitely generic factors to be unifo rmly super McDuﬀ. In
this subsection, we present a suﬃcient criterion for a ﬁnite ly generic factor to be uniformly super
McDuﬀ. We ﬁrst need a preliminary lemma.
Lemma 5.3. For anyK≥1, there is a function αK: (0,1)→(0,1)with the following property:
Suppose that Nhas property (T) with ﬁnite Kazhdan set Gand Kazhdan constant at most K. Then
for any II 1factorMcontainingNand any (p,q)∈ P2(M)withmaxx∈Gmax(/bardbl[x,p]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,q]/bardbl2)<
αK(ǫ), there is (p′,q′)∈ P2(N′∩M)with/bardblp−p′/bardbl2,/bardblq−q′/bardbl2<ǫ.
Proof. Suppose that δ <1
Kand(p,q)∈ P2(M)is such that
max
x∈Gmax(/bardbl[x,p]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,q]/bardbl2)<δ.
Then by the deﬁnition of Kazhdan set, there is (p0,q0)∈N′∩Msuch that /bardblp−p0/bardbl2,/bardblq−q0/bardbl2<
Kδ. Recall from Subsection 2.2 the formula ξwhose zeroset is P2. Letβ:R>0→R>0be the
uniform continuity modulus for ξandγ:R>0→R>0be the deﬁnability modulus for ξ. Then
ifKδ < β (γ(ǫ
2)), we have ξ(p0,q0)< γ(ǫ
2), whence there is (p′,q′)∈ P2(N′∩M)such that
/bardblp0−p′/bardbl2,/bardblq0−q′/bardbl2<ǫ
2. Thus,αK(ǫ) := min(1
Kβ(γ(ǫ

2K)is the desired function. /square
Proposition 5.4. Suppose that Pis ﬁnitely generic and there is a II 1factorN⊇Pwith property
(T)for which there is an embedding N ֒→PUwith factorial relative commutant. Then Pis uniformly
super McDuﬀ.
Proof. We consider the sequence of embeddings
P⊆N ֒→PU⊆NU֒→P2U⊆N2U···,UNIFORMLY SUPER MCDUFF II 1FACTORS 17
where for each k∈N, we letPkUdenote the kth-iterated ultrapower of Pand similarly for other
iterated ultrapowers and the embeddings NkU֒→P(k+1)Uare induced by the original embedding
N ֒→PU. We letQdenote the union of the chain. Since Pis ﬁnitely generic, we have that the
embedding P ֒→PUis elementary, whence so are all of the iterated embeddings PkU֒→P(k+1)U,
and thusQ≡P. It thus suﬃces to show that Qis uniformly super McDuﬀ.
LetGbe a ﬁnite Kazhdan set for Nwith Kazhdan constant K.
Claim: Fixǫ >0. For allk≥1, and all (p,q)∈ P2(PkU), if/bardbl[x,p]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,q]/bardbl2< αK(ǫ
2)for all
x∈G(viewed as elements of PkUin the obvious way), then there is u∈U((N(k−1)U)′∩PkU)such
that/bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2≤ǫ.
We prove the claim by induction on k. First suppose that k= 1. If
max
x∈Gmax(/bardbl[x,p]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,q]/bardbl2)<αK/parenleftBigǫ
2/parenrightBig
,
then there is (p′,q′)∈ P2(N′∩PU)with/bardblp−p′/bardbl2,/bardblq−q′/bardbl2<ǫ
2. SinceN′∩PUis a factor, there is
u∈U(N′∩PU)withup′u∗=q′. It follows that /bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2≤ǫ. Thus, the case k= 1is proven.
We now prove the inductive step. Suppose the result is true fo rkand consider (p,q)∈ P2(P(k+1)U)
with/bardbl[x,p]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,q]/bardbl2< αK(ǫ
2)for allx∈G. Writep= (pn)Uandq= (qn)Uwith(pn,qn)∈
P2(PkU). It follows that for U-almost all nwe have /bardbl[x,pn]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,qn]/bardbl2< αK(ǫ
2)for allx∈G,
whence, by induction, for these n, there are un∈U((N(k−1)U)′∩PkU)with/bardblunpnu∗
n−qn/bardbl2≤ǫ.
Lettingu= (un)U∈U((NkU)′∩P(k+1)U), we see that /bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2≤ǫ, as desired. The claim is
thus proven.
We now verify that Qis uniformly super McDuﬀ. Fix ǫ >0and takeδas in the claim for ǫ. Fix
F⊆Qﬁnite. Take k≥1such thatF⊆ǫ
2N(k−1)U. Now suppose that (p,q)∈ P2(Q)are such that
maxx∈Gmax(/bardbl[x,p]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,q]/bardbl2)< ρ(forρ >0to be determined). Take l≥ksuch that there are
(p′,q′)∈ P2(PlU)with/bardblp−p′/bardbl2,/bardblq−q′/bardbl2<ρ. Thenmaxx∈Gmax(/bardbl[x,p′]/bardbl2,/bardbl[x,q′]/bardbl2)<αK(ǫ
4)if
ρwas small enough, whence by the claim there is u∈U((N(l−1)U)′∩PlU)with/bardblup′u∗−q′/bardbl2≤ǫ
2.
It follows that /bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2<ǫand/bardbl[u,x]/bardbl2<ǫfor allx∈F. /square
Remark 5.5. We note that, in the previous proposition, one can obtain the weaker conclusion that
Pis super McDuﬀ using [AGE22, Theorem 3.2.2.].
5.2.The (T)-FRC property. To apply Proposition 5.4 to a ﬁnitely generic P, we would need
a property (T) factor NcontainingPwhich admits an embedding into PUwith factorial relative
commutant. In fact, one can ask whether every property (T) fa ctorNadmits such an embedding,
motivating the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 5.6. We say that a separable II 1factorMhas the (T)-FRC property if every II 1
factor with property (T) admits an embedding into MUwith factorial relative commutant.
It will be a consequence of Proposition 5.12 below that wheth er or not a given property (T) factor
admits an embedding into MUwith factorial relative commutant is independent of the cho ice of
ultraﬁlter, making the (T)-FRC well-deﬁned. Another conse quence of Proposition 5.12 is that the
(T)-FRC property is preserved under elementary equivalenc e.
We may also relativize the (T)-FRC property to the setting of Connes embeddable factors:18 GOLDBRING, JEKEL, KUNNAWALKAM ELAYAVALLI, AND PI
Deﬁnition 5.7. A Connes embeddable separable II 1factorMhas the embeddable (T)-FRC
property if every Connes embeddable property (T) factor admits an emb edding into MUwith
factorial relative commutant.
A well-known question of Popa asks whether or not Rhas the embeddable (T)-FRC property.
Proposition 5.4 together with embedding universality of Pr operty (T) factors yields the following:
Corollary 5.8. If the ﬁnitely generic factors have the (T)-FRC property, th en they are also uni-
formly super McDuﬀ.
Corollary 5.9. If the (T)-FRC property is enforceable, then being uniforml y super McDuﬀ is en-
forceable. In particular, if the enforceable factor exists and has the (T)-FRC property, then it is
uniformly super McDuﬀ.
Remarks 5.10.
(1) The conclusion of Corollary 5.8 holds in the Connes embed dable case as well. As mentioned
above,Ris the unique separable ﬁnitely generic Connes embeddable f actor. Thus, if Rhas
the embeddable (T)-FRC property, then this would give yet a d iﬀerent argument that Ris
uniformly super McDuﬀ (which, to be fair, is less informativ e than both Brown’s original
proof that Rhas the Brown property, which tells one what the intermediate subfactor is
that has factorial commutant, and our proof above using quan tum expanders).
(2) It is interesting to note that in the Connes embeddable ca se, the ﬁnitely generic factor
is uniformly super McDuﬀ although we do not know if the inﬁnit ely generic factors are
uniformly super McDuﬀ. (It is an open question as to whether o r notRis an inﬁnitely
generic embeddable factor.) On the other hand, in the unrest ricted case, as shown in
Theorem 4.13, the inﬁnitely generic factors are uniformly s uper McDuﬀ and we are unsure
whether the ﬁnitely generic factors are uniformly super McD uﬀ.
Given Corollary 5.8, it is now natural to ask:
Question 5.11. Do ﬁnitely generic factors have the (T)-FRC property?
In [Gol20], it was shown that the inﬁnitely generic factors h ave the (T)-FRC property. Thus, if the
ﬁnitely and inﬁnitely generic factors are elementarily equ ivalent, then the ﬁnitely generic factors
also have the (T)-FRC property.
5.3.Model-theoretic aspects of the (T)-FRC property. In this section, we explain why prov-
ing the (T)-FRC property for inﬁnitely generic factors is ea sier than proving the (T)-FRC property
for an arbitrary e.c. factor, which in turn is easier than pro ving the (T)-FRC property for ﬁnitely
genric factors. We ﬁrst observe:
Proposition 5.12. For any property (T) factor N, there is a family (σN,m)m≥1of∃3-sentences
such that the following are equivalent for any II 1factorM:
(1)σM
N,m= 0for allm≥1.
(2) For every ultraﬁlter U,Nembeds into MUwith factorial relative commutant.
(3) For some ultraﬁlter U,Nembeds into MUwith factorial relative commutant.UNIFORMLY SUPER MCDUFF II 1FACTORS 19
Proof. Fix a property (T) factor Nwith generating set Fof cardinality nand Kazhdan constant
K. For eachm≥1, consider the following formula ψN,m(/vector x)in the free variables /vector x= (x1,...,x n):

m)/parenrightbigg
= 0,
whereαKis as in Lemma 5.3. Enumerate a countable dense subset of qftpN(F)as{θN,i(/vector x) :i∈ω}
and letσN,mbeinfxmax(max i=1,...,mθi(x),ψN,m(x)). Note that ψN,m(/vector x)is a∀2-formula, whence
σN,mis a∃3-sentence. We claim that these are the desired sentences.
First suppose that σM
N,m= 0for allm≥1. Then by saturation, there is a tuple /vector a= (a1,...,an)
inMUsatisfying qftpN(F)and for which ψMU
N,m(/vector a) = 0 for allm≥1. There is thus an embedding
N ֒→MUobtained by sending the elements of Fto theai’s. We claim that this embedding has
factorial relative commutant. To see this, ﬁx (p,q)∈ P2(N′∩MU)andm≥1. Then the ﬁrst part
of the minimum appearing in ψN,misαK(1
2m), whence the second part of the minimum must be
0. Thus, there is u∈U(MU)such that /bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2≤1
mand/bardbl[u,ai]/bardbl2≤1
m. Since such a unitary
exists for all m≥1, by saturation, there is u∈U(N′∩MU)conjugating ptoq, as desired.
Now suppose that Nadmits an embedding into MUwith factorial relative commutant for some
ultraﬁlter U. Leta1,...,a n∈MUbe the images of the elements of Funder the embedding. Fix
m≥1. We show that ψMU
N,m(/vector a) = 0, whenceσM
N,m=σMU
N,m= 0. Towards this end, ﬁx (p,q)∈ P2(MU)
and suppose /bardbl[ai,p]/bardbl2,/bardbl[ai,q]/bardbl2< αK(1
2m)for alli= 1,...,n . Arguing exactly as in the proof of
Proposition 5.4, there is u∈U(N′∩MU)satisfying /bardblupu∗−q/bardbl2≤1
m. Thisurealizes the inner
inﬁmum in ψN,m. /square
Corollary 5.13. The (T)-FRC property and the embeddable (T)-FRC property ar e both∃3-axiomatizable
properties of separable II 1factors.
Remarks 5.14.
(1) One could use the sentences in Proposition 5.12 to give a d eﬁnition of the (T)-FRC property
for arbitrary II 1factors.
(2) It is worth pointing out that the (T)-FRC property is axio matizable while we currently
only know that the Brown property is merely local, that is, preserved under elementary
equivalence.
Let us recall the following various facts about truth of ∃3sentences in e.c. structures, which, for
simplicity, we state only for II 1factors (although the ﬁrst item holds in general and the seco nd and
third item hold in any ∀2theory with the joint embedding property). The classical ve rsions of these
results appear as [Hod06, Corollary 3.2.5, Exercise 5.3.12 , Theorem 4.3.4].
Fact 5.15. Suppose that σis a∃3-sentence in the language of tracial von Neumann algebras.
(1) IfM⊆Nare e.c. factors and σM= 0, thenσN= 0. (Here,σcan even have parameters
fromM.)
(2) IfσM= 0for some e.c. factor, then σN= 0for all inﬁnitely generic factors.20 GOLDBRING, JEKEL, KUNNAWALKAM ELAYAVALLI, AND PI
(3) IfσM= 0for some ﬁnitely generic factor, then σN= 0for all e.c. factors.
Proof of (1) and (2). For (1), ﬁx an embedding i:N ֒→MUrestricting to the diagonal embedding
M ֒→MU. Writeσ= infxsupyinfzϕ(x,y,z), whereϕis a quantiﬁer-free formula with parameters
fromM. SinceσM= 0, there isa∈Msuch that (supyinfzϕ(a,y,z))M= 0. Fixb∈N; we need
(infzϕ(a,b,z))N= 0. However, since Nis e.c., this follows from (infzϕ(a,i(b),z))MU= 0, which
in turn follows from the fact that (supyinfzϕ(a,y,z))MU= 0.
(2) follows from (1) together with the facts that the inﬁnite ly generic factors are e.c., embedding
universal, and are all elementarily equivalent to one anoth er. /square
The third item in the above proposition can be proven just as i n the classical case, using the
continuous versions of the necessary ingredients which wer e established in [Gol21].
The second item in the previous fact explains why proving tha t the inﬁnitely generic factors have
the (T)-FRC property was the “easiest” possible while the th ird item explains why proving that R
has the embeddable (T)-FRC property and the ﬁnitely generic factors have the (T)-FRC property
are as “hard” as possible.
Item (1) of the above fact also yields the following fact:
Corollary 5.16. IfMis an e.c. factor that contains an inﬁnitely generic factor, thenMhas the
(T)-FRC property.
We remark that it is still possible that all e.c. factors may b e inﬁnitely generic, whence the previous
corollary would degenerate to the main result of [Gol20].
