Abstract —A primary objective of the forthcoming sixth gen-
eration (6G) of wireless networking is to support demanding
applications, while ensuring energy efficiency. Programmable
wireless environments (PWEs) have emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), to
control wireless propagation and deliver exceptional quality-of-
service. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a network
supported by zero-energy RISs (zeRISs) , which harvest energy
for their operation and contribute to the realization of PWEs.
Specifically, we investigate joint energy-data rate outage probabil-
ity and the energy efficiency of a zeRIS-assisted communication
system by employing three harvest-and-reflect (HaR) methods,
i) power splitting, ii) time switching, and iii) element splitting.
Furthermore, we consider two zeRIS deployment strategies,
namely BS-side zeRIS and UE-side zeRIS. Simulation results
validate the provided analysis and examine which HaR method
performs better depending on the zeRIS placement. Finally,
valuable insights and conclusions for the performance of zeRIS-
assisted wireless networks are drawn from the presented results.

The work has been funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research

and grant agreement No 958478 (EnerMan). The work of Y . Xiao was
supported by the National NSFC 62201477 and Sichuan Youth Fund Project
2023NSFSC1374it into a software-defined procedure and enabling pervasive
connectivity [2]–[4]. In this direction, a prominent approach
to implement PWEs involves integrating reconfigurable in-
telligent surfaces (RISs) into the environment, which can
manipulate power, direction, polarization, and phase of in-
cident waves through their reflective elements in an almost
passive manner [5]–[7]. By employing RISs, networks can
orchestrate customized propagation routes, significantly en-
hance wireless channel quality, and facilitate cutting-edge
applications such as intelligent sensing, accurate localization,
efficient data transmission, over-the-air computing, and im-
mersive extended reality experiences [8]–[13]. Thus, through
the dynamic control of the wireless environment, the future of
wireless communication could be reshaped, leading to more
adaptive and efficient networks capable of meeting the diverse
demands of various applications and user scenarios [2], [4],
[5], [14].
To harness the full capabilities of a PWE, which allow it to
manipulate transmitted waves, it is imperative to deploy a large
number of RISs within the wireless propagation environment.
Nevertheless, considering the importance of energy efficiency
in the context of 6G networks, the development and adoption
of sustainable techniques to achieve this objective is essential
[15]. Wireless power transfer (WPT) facilitates the establish-
ment of an environmental-friendly network based on zero-
energy devices (ZEDs), which are powered by harvesting en-
ergy from radio-frequency (RF) signals [15]–[18]. Therefore,
by converting RISs into ZEDs, referred in this paper as zero-
energy RISs (zeRISs) , we can facilitate the implementation of
energy-efficient PWEs and fulfill the principal criterion for
sustainability [3], [17], [18]. More specifically, by incorporat-
ing a suitable energy harvesting (EH) system and capitalizing
on the absorption functionality of RISs [2], we can harvest the
necessary energy for their functioning and transform conven-
tional RISs into zeRISs, thus eliminating the need for desig-
nated power sources. Consequently, zeRISs can be proposed as
an important component of future 6G eco-friendly networks,
while simultaneously enabling the realization of various PWE-
enabled services through their electromagnetic functionalities,
such as beam-steering and beam-splitting, among others [2],
[19], [20].
A. State-of-the-art and Motivation
Recent studies have explored the transformative potential
of converting RISs into ZEDs to enhance their performance
in an energy-efficient manner [21]–[28]. For example, the
authors of [21] and [22] considered the feasibility of makingarXiv:2305.07686v3  [cs.IT]  23 Apr 20242
a conventional RIS self-sustainable, while [23] examined the
WPT efficiency of a network assisted by such a RIS. However,
the authors in [23] concentrated primarily on specific EH
methods without addressing the broader impact of factors such
as varying propagation conditions, zeRIS locations, or the
potential benefits of other EH techniques. Similarly, [24] ana-
lyzed a network in which ZEDs perform simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) through a wireless-
powered RIS, with a focus on minimizing transmit power, yet
did not investigate alternative EH methods that could offer
improved performance. Further research in [25] introduced a
self-sustainable RIS to enhance the performance of a wireless-
powered communication network, where a hybrid access point
transfers energy to the RIS and multiple users, enabling
subsequent information transmission after the EH process. In
[26], the authors tackled the sum-rate maximization problem
in a self-sustainable RIS-aided system, wherein information
users and WPT clients are served separately. Meanwhile, [27]
aimed to minimize the transmit power of a self-sustainable
RIS-assisted system, taking into account the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of the receivers and energy budget constraints.
Finally, [28] proposed an innovative RIS architecture that
replaces traditional reflecting elements with backscattering
devices, which harvest energy and produce amplitude and
phase shift effects on received waves instead of remodulating
them. Despite these advances though, there exists no work
that has established suitable metrics for quantifying the perfor-
mance of a zeRIS-assisted network with varying EH methods,
propagation conditions, and zeRIS topologies. Addressing this
gap is crucial for a comprehensive understanding the key
factors that influence the performance of a zeRIS-assisted
network, offering guidance for network designers.
B. Contribution
In this paper, we investigate the performance of a point-
to-point communication system assisted by a zeRIS, which
harvests the necessary energy for its operation and facilitates
information transmission through its beam-steering function-
ality, utilizing the harvest-and-reflect (HaR) protocol. More
specifically, the primary contributions of this work can be
summarized as follows:
•We explore the performance of three prominent zeRIS-
HaR methods: i) power splitting (PS), involving tunable
absorption and beam manipulation per zeRIS element; ii)
time switching (TS), which alternates between absorption
and beam manipulation over time per element; and iii)
element splitting (ES), entailing distinct absorption or
beam manipulation per element.
•To assess the distinct features of each HaR method, we
express the required energy for the zeRIS operation when
each method is applied, and derive closed-form expres-
sions for the joint energy-data rate outage probability
of the system. This probability quantifies the trade-off
between EH and information transmission, which can be
employed for the derivation of the energy efficiency for
all investigated HaR methods.
•To characterize the impact of the zeRIS placement on
the network’s performance, we derive expressions forthe joint energy-data rate outage probability and for the
system’s energy efficiency in two scenarios: the zeRIS is
located near the base station (BS), i.e., BS-side zeRIS, or
near the user equipment (UE), i.e., UE-side zeRIS.
•We present simulation results to verify the mathemati-
cal analysis and evaluate the influence of the available
number of reflecting elements, the applied HaR method,
the zeRIS location, and the propagation conditions on
the performance of a zeRIS-assisted wireless network.
Unlike conventional RIS-assisted scenarios, we argue that
the performance of UE-side zeRIS-assisted systems is
asymmetric to that of the BS-side case, even when the
system parameters remain the same for both deployment
scenarios.
C. Structure
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. The
zeRIS architecture, the analyzed system model, as well as the
examined HaR methods and zeRIS deployment strategies are
described in Section II. Moreover, the performance analysis
is given in Section III, while our results are presented in
Section IV . Finally, Section V concludes the paper. Throughout
this paper, several specialized mathematical notations and
functions are employed to facilitate the analysis. Specifically,
Γ(·)represents the gamma function, γ(·,·)denotes the lower
incomplete gamma function, and In(·)refers to the n-th
order modified Bessel function of the first kind. Finally, δ(·)
represents the Dirac function, and E[·]denotes the expected
value of a random variable.
II. Z ERO-ENERGY RECONFIGURABLE INTELLIGENT
SURFACE (ZERIS)
A. zeRIS Architecture
Our main goal is to develop a reconfigurable metasurface
unit, i.e., a zeRIS, that is entirely self-sufficient in terms of
energy, relying only on incoming waves for power. To achieve
this, we suggest a new programmable metasurface architecture,
i.e., zeRIS architecture, that includes reflecting elements with
adjustable impedance and a specialized controller responsible
for the zeRIS connection with the network and the reflecting
elements’ configuration. Specifically, we assume that each
zeRIS element contains an RF-to-DC converter, converting a
predefined portion of the incoming wave power into a DC
voltage. This voltage is subsequently stored in a capacitor
that functions as short-term energy storage, ensuring a steady
flow of electricity to the zeRIS controller and the impedance-
switching components and, thus, the initial required energy for
the zeRIS operation. It should be mentioned that the element
design can direct a variable part of the incoming wave to the
rectifier without altering the wave’s phase that reaches the
impedance switch. This can be achieved by adding a non-
reciprocal energy-moving component immediately after the
metallic element patch, which allows energy to enter and exit a
central structure in both symmetric and asymmetric ways [29],
[30]. However, if non-reciprocal components are not preferred
due to manufacturing challenges, it can be considered that the3
rectifier does not affect the accuracy of the impedance switch
by designing the components properly.
With these components, each zeRIS element can alter the
amplitude and phase of received waves, following the phased
antenna array operating principle and the programming in-
structions from the zeRIS controller. Regarding the physical
structure, each zeRIS element has an antenna pattern layer,
which can be made using basic printing techniques, followed
by an RF insulator and a ground layer whose thickness and
material depend on the desired resonant frequency. Lastly,
through-vias can connect the antenna pattern to the element
rectifier and the element impedance switch.
B. System Model
We consider a downlink communication network that con-
sists of: i) a BS equipped with a single-antenna, ii) a zeRIS
withNreflecting elements, and iii) a single-antenna UE. Due
to the harsh propagation conditions, the BS takes advantage
of the zeRIS’s ability to steer its impinging radiation towards
the UE, assuming that perfect channel state information is
available at the BS. Hence, taking into account that the zeRIS
needs to harvest energy to operate, it is vital to determine the
most appropriate way to perform the absorption functionality
without compromising the network’s reliability.
C. zeRIS-HaR Methods
In this work, inspired by the Simultaneously Transmitting
and Reflecting (STAR) RIS paradigm [31] the following three
primary zeRIS-HaR techniques are examined:
1) Power splitting: The PS method, as illustrated in Fig.
1a, divides the signal power into two separate streams: the
EH stream and the information transmission stream [32]. This
division is controlled by the tunable PS factor ρ∈[0,1].
The portion of the received power for EH is ρ, while the
information transmission stream’s power is proportional to
1−ρ. It should be noted that, since EH and reflection are
performed simultaneously in PS, the aforementioned capacitor
provides the initial required energy for the zeRIS operation. As
a result, the received signal for the PS case can be expressed
as follows
yPS=»
ℓPt(1−ρ)GNX
i=1|h1i||h2i|ejϕix+n, (1)
where xis the transmitted symbol with unit energy, Ptis the
transmit power, G=GtGris the product of the antenna gains,
i.e., the transmit and receive antenna, and Nis the number
of reflecting elements. Furthermore, ndescribes the additive
white Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance equal to σ2,
ℓ=ℓ1ℓ2is the end-to-end link’s path loss and it is equal to the
product of the path losses of the BS-zeRIS and the zeRIS-UE
links that are given as
ℓu=C0d−au
u, (2)
where u∈ {1,2},d1is the BS-zeRIS distance, d2is the zeRIS-
UE distance, and a1,a2denote the path loss exponents for
the BS-zeRIS and zeRIS-UE channels, respectively. Moreover,
C0=λ2
16π2is the path loss at the reference distance d0,

where λis the wavelength of the emitted waves, h1iand
h2iare the channel coefficients between the BS and the i-
th reflecting element and between the i-th reflecting element
and the UE, respectively, and ϕi=ωi+ arg ( h1i) + arg ( h2i),
where ωiis the phase shift induced by the i-th reflecting
element, arg (h1i)is the phase of h1i, and arg (h2i)is the phase
ofh2i. Therefore, assuming that ρis equal for all reflecting
elements, the instantaneous rate when the PS method is applied
and the zeRIS is perfectly configured for the beam-steering
functionality, i.e., ωi=−arg(h1i)−arg(h2i), can be expressed
as
RPS= log 2Ñ
1 +γtGℓ(1−ρ)NX
i=1|h1i||h2i|2é
, (3)
where γt=Pt
σ2is the transmit SNR.
To effectively utilize a zeRIS, it is critical to determine
its power consumption, which results from the configuration
of reflecting elements, controller operation, and EH circuitry.
Therefore, a key factor that strongly influences the consump-
tion of a zeRIS is the chosen HaR method, as it determines
how many reflecting elements are configured for energy ab-4
sorption and how many contribute to other electromagnetic
functionalities. In this direction, when using the PS method,
all zeRIS reflecting elements handle both beam-steering and
energy absorption. Consequently, the necessary amount of
energy that needs to be harvested when the PS method is
applied can be expressed as
EPS=T(NPe+Pcirc), (4)
where Trepresents the time slot duration, Pedenotes the
power consumption of each reflecting element, and Pcirc
denotes the power consumption of the zeRIS controller respon-
sible for setting the induced phase shift for each element [6],
[33]. Hence, by employing the linear EH model, the harvested
energy when employing the PS technique can be expressed as
QPS=TρζP tGtl1NX
i=1|h1i|ej(ωi+arg( h1i))2
, (5)
where ζ∈(0,1]is the energy conversion efficiency. It should
be mentioned that ζaccounts for both the inherent ineffi-
ciencies in the EH circuitry and the power losses due to the
operational needs of the circuitry. Therefore, ζeffectively cap-
tures the available energy for use after the EH and conversion
processes.
As it can be observed, to maximize the amount of harvested
energy, the phase shift term ωishould be equal to −arg(h1i), to
achieve the maximum channel gain. However, considering that
in PS the zeRIS is configured to perform the beam-steering
functionality, the channel gain for the harvested energy is
equal toPN
i=1|h1i|ejarg(h2i). It should be noted that, in this
work, we have chosen a suboptimal PS scheme, aligning
the cascaded BS-RIS-user link, for simplicity and ease of
implementation, in contrast to fully-optimized schemes of
significant complexity, but also considering that this link is
subject to double path loss. Therefore, the amount of harvested
energy when PS is applied can be rewritten as
QPS=TρζP tGtℓ1NX
i=1|h1i|ejarg(h2i)2
. (6)
2) Time switching: As illustrated in Fig. 1b, in the TS
case, the received signal is used solely for EH or receiving
information during specific time periods. Specifically, Tis
divided into two time intervals determined by the splitting
factor τ∈[0,1]. Within the first time interval, i.e., [0, τT],
the zeRIS is configured for EH, while within the second time
interval, i.e., (τT, T ], the RIS is configured for information
transmission. Thus, the received signal for TS is given as
yTS=

0, 0≤t≤τT
√ℓPtGNP
i=1|h1i||h2i|ejϕix+n, τT < t ≤T.(7)
Hence, the instantaneous rate at the receiver when the TS
method is applied can be expressed as
RTS= (1−τ) log 2Ñ
1 +γtGℓNX
i=1|h1i||h2i|2é
. (8)
Accordingly to the PS case, we need to define the energy
that needs to be harvested via the TS method. Hence, con-
sidering that all reflecting elements will be configured forinformation transmission only for a specific amount of time,
then the required energy for the TS case is given as
ETS=T((1−τ)NPe+Pcirc). (9)
Thus, to maximize the absorbed energy within the EH time
interval, the phase shift term of each reflecting element is set
asωi=−arg(h1i). Therefore, in contrast to PS, when TS is
applied, the reflecting elements are set in the first time interval
to absorb the maximum amount of energy which is given as
QTS=TÑ
τζPtGtℓ1NX
i=1|h1i|2é
. (10)
It should be highlighted that due to the fact that each reflecting
element can select a unique value of phase shift to induce, the
zeRIS can acquire the maximum amount of energy in the TS
method, as it can set the corresponding optimal phase shifts
within the two time intervals. However, in PS, by considering
that the phase shifts are set for the beam-steering functionality,
the maximum amount of energy cannot be harvested, as the
reflecting elements are not properly configured.
3) Element splitting: Aside from PS and TS, the large
number of reflecting elements enables a zeRIS to harvest
energy through the ES method. In more detail, for the ES
method, N1reflecting elements are configured for EH, while
the rest of them, i.e., N2with N1+N2=N, are configured
for information transmission, as shown in Fig. 1c. Therefore,
the received signal for the ES case can be expressed as
yES=√
ℓPtGNX
i=N1+1|h1i||h2i|ejϕix+n. (11)
Thus, the instantaneous rate at the UE when the ES method
is applied is given as
RES=Blog2Ñ
1 +γtGℓNX
i=N1+1|h1i||h2i|2é
, (12)
Finally, considering the number of reflecting elements that
participate in the beam-steering functionality, the required
energy for a zeRIS that performs ES is given as
EES=T(N2Pe+Pcirc). (13)
To this end, the harvested energy can be expressed as
QES=TζP tGtℓ1N1X
i=1|h1i|2
. (14)
It should be noted that by dividing the reflecting elements
into absorbing and beam-steering elements, the absorbing re-
flecting elements are configured properly for maximum energy
absorption. Finally, it should be highlighted that for the rest
of this work, Tis assumed to be equal to 1, therefore it is
omitted for brevity.
D. zeRIS Deployment
Considering that the communication performance of a con-
ventional RIS-assisted system is optimized when the RIS is
positioned close to the BS or the UE [34], we investigate
two deployment strategies, namely BS-side zeRIS or UE-side5
zeRIS. In more detail, in the BS-side case, the BS chooses
a nearby zeRIS with which it shares a line-of-sight (LoS)
channel, i.e., |h1i|= 1andarg(h1i) =2πd1
λ, while the zeRIS-
UE channel |h2i|is assumed to be a random variable (RV)
following the Nakagami- mdistribution with shape parameter
mand scale parameter Ω. Accordingly, for the UE-side case,
the zeRIS is deployed near the UE with which it shares a LoS
link, i.e., |h2i|= 1 andarg(h2i) =2πd2
λ, while the BS-zeRIS
channel |h1i|is assumed to be an RV following the Nakagami-
mdistribution with shape parameter mand scale parameter
Ω. Thus, the moments of |h2i|in the BS-side and|h1i|in the
UE-side can be expressed as E[|hui|n] =Γ(m+n
2)
Γ(m) Ω
mn
2. It
should be highlighted, that our objective in detailing both BS-
side andUE-side zeRIS scenarios is not a mere comparison,
but to provide a tailored framework rooted in the PWE
concept, where the decision on which zeRIS should be used
often depends on the specific application and, crucially, on
user reachability.
III. T HEORETICAL ANALYSIS
A zeRIS must acquire a sufficient amount of energy to
perform different functionalities such as beam-steering. There-
fore, in order to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the
reliability of a communication system that relies on a zeRIS,
we utilize a performance metric termed as joint energy-data
rate outage probability . This metric takes into account both
the energy outage event, which describes that the zeRIS has
failed to harvest sufficient energy for its operation, and the
data rate outage event, which indicates that the rate falls below
a predetermined rate threshold Rthrin bit/s/Hz. Furthermore,
considering that different EH techniques can be employed by
the zeRIS to obtain the necessary energy, we also calculate the
network’s energy efficiency for each examined HaR method
and zeRIS deployment location (i.e., BS-side orUE-side ).
Thus, in this section, we provide analytical expressions for
the joint energy-data rate outage probability of the evaluated
HaR methods, as well as the network’s energy efficiency for
the cases where the zeRIS is deployed either at the BS-side or
at the UE-side .
Definition 1: The joint energy-data rate outage probability of
a zeRIS-assisted system is defined as the union of the energy
outage event, i.e., the zeRIS has not harvested the required
amount of energy for its operation, and the data rate outage
event, i.e., the received SNR is lower than a predefined SNR
threshold [32]. Therefore, we present analytic expressions for
the joint energy-data rate outage probability which can be
expressed as
Pq2q1= Pr ( Qq2≤Eq2∪Rq2≤Rthr), (15)
where Qq2is the amount of harvested energy, Eq2is the
required amount of energy for the zeRIS operation, Rq2is
the instantaneous rate at the UE, q1∈ {B,U}indicates if
the zeRIS is deployed BS-side orUE-side , respectively, and
q2∈ {PS,TS,ES}indicates which HaR method is applied.
In addition, the escalating demand for wireless communi-
cation necessitates the optimization of energy consumption in
networks, particularly in the context of zeRISs, in order tominimize their environmental impact. Thus, it is imperative to
quantify the required transmit power Ptto achieve a specific
outage performance.
Definition 2: The energy efficiency of a zeRIS-assisted
network is defined as the ratio of the target rate multiplied
by the complementary probability of the joint energy-data
rate outage probability to the transmit power Ptand can be
expressed as
Eq2q1=Rthr
Pt 1−Pq2q1[bit/J/Hz]. (16)
Remark 1: The inclusion of the joint energy-data rate
outage probability within the definition of energy efficiency
enables the quantitative assessment of the performance of a
zeRIS-assisted network with regard to both communication
performance and energy consumption.
A. BS-side zeRIS
For the case where the zeRIS is placed near to the BS, the
joint energy-data rate outage probability for the examined EH
techniques, is given in the following propositions. First, the
PS case is presented.

Proof: The proof is found in Appendix A.
As it can be observed, the system performance for the BS-
side PS case strongly depends on whether the communication
link has a direct connection or is affected by obstacles.6
Notably, even when the zeRIS-UE link is used only for com-
munication, the conditions of this link still significantly affect
the absorption functionality. This emphasizes the importance
of the channel conditions and points out unique considerations
in zeRIS-assisted communications.
In contrast to the PS method, where the zeRIS simulta-
neously performs the beam-steering and the absorption func-
tionality, in the TS method, the zeRIS is configured for energy
absorption until it harvests the required amount of energy, and
then all its elements are reconfigured to serve the data trans-
mission via beam-steering. Thus, in the following proposition,
we provide the joint energy-data rate outage probability for the
case where the TS method is applied from a BS-side zeRIS.
Proposition 2: The joint energy-data rate outage probability
for a BS-side zeRIS that applies the TS method can be

Therefore, by invoking the moment-matching method in a
similar way as in Proposition 1 , the probability in the second

Remark 2: Considering (24) which shows monotonicity
when N≥w3and coincides with the CDF of the Gamma
distribution, an increase in τleads to a corresponding increase
inw4. This implies that the joint energy-data rate outage
probability will continuously increase. To this end, the optimal
time splitting factor τ∗
Bcan be derived by solving the equation
N=w3. Thus, after some algebraic manipulations, we can
obtain the optimal time splitting factor τ∗
Bwhich is equal to
τ∗
B=NPe+Pcirc
NPe+N2ζPtGtl1. (27)
In addition to the PS and the TS methods, a zeRIS can
also operate by dividing its reflecting elements into two parts:
N1reflecting elements performing the absorption function-
ality to assist in the EH, meaning that their induced phase
shift is set as ωi=−arg(h1i), and N2reflecting elements
performing the beam-steering functionality for informationtransmission, meaning that their induced phase shift is set as
ωi=−arg(h1i)−arg(h2i). To this end, in the following propo-
sition, we derive the joint energy-data rate outage probability
for the case where a BS-side zeRIS harvests energy through
the ES method.
Proposition 3: The joint energy-data rate outage probability
for a BS-side zeRIS that applies the ES technique can be
approximated as

Considering that N2is not necessarily large, we cannot guar-
antee that the moment-matching technique can offer a tight

B. Therefore, by utilizing the results
provided in [35] the sum of Niindependent and identi-
cally distributed Nakagami- mRVs can be approximated by
a Nakagami- mRV with shape parameter mes(u, N i)and scale
parameter Ωes(Ni), respectively. Finally, considering the cumu-

Remark 3: Considering the monotonicity of (28) for the
case where N1≥w5, by increasing N1,N2decreases, which
means that the joint energy-data rate outage probability will
tend to 1. To this end, the optimal number of reflecting
elements N∗

Thus, by replacing N2with N−N1, after some algebraic
manipulations, we can obtain the optimal number of absorbing
reflecting elements N∗

N∗

B. UE-side zeRIS
As stated in the literature, due to the double path loss model,
as shown in (2), a zeRIS can also be deployed in the proximity
of the UE to establish LoS zeRIS-UE links, i.e., |h2i|= 1, and7
f(u, N i) =NiÄ
E[|hui|4] + 4( Ni−1)E[|hui|3]E[|hui|] + 3( Ni−1)E2[|hui|2] + 6( Ni−1)(Ni−2)E[|hui|2]E2[|hui|]
+(Ni−1)(Ni−2)(Ni−3)E4[|hui|]ä (31)
offer reliable communication [34]. Hence, by assuming that
|h1i|is a Nakagami- mRV with shape parameter m, and scale
parameter Ω, then the joint energy-data rate outage probability
for all the examined EH techniques is given in the following
proposition.
Proposition 4: The joint energy-data rate outage probability
for the PS protocol can be approximated as

Proof: By substituting (3), (6), (4) in (15), and by taking
into account that |h2i|= 1, the joint energy-data rate outage
probability for a UE-side zeRIS -assisted network that applies
the PS method can be expressed as

which after some algebraic manipulations can be rewritten as

U= Pr NX
i=1|h1i| ≤w1∪NX
i=1|h1i| ≤w2!
. (37)
It can be observed that Z2=PN
i=1|h1i|is upper bounded
in both events. Specifically, the union of these events occurs
when Z2is lower than the maximum of these upper bounds.
Hence, PPS
Bcan be further expressed as
PPS
U= Pr ( Z2≤max ( w1, w2)). (38)
Thus, by invoking the moment-matching technique as shown
inProposition 1 ,Z2can be tightly approximated by a gamma-
distributed RV with shape parameter kPSand scale parameter
θPS, respectively, and, thus, PPS
Ucan be calculated through
(56), which concludes the proof.
Remark 4: By setting w1=w2, we can obtain the optimal
power-splitting factor that minimizes the joint energy-data rate
outage probability for the UE-side PS case, which is equal to
ρ∗
U=1
1 +σ2ζ(2Rthr−1)
(NPe+Pcirc)Grl2. (39)
As it can be observed, (39) highlights the trade-off between
EH and information decoding. To this end, adjusting ρ∗allows
for the optimization of both EH efficiency and data rate,
depending on the energy demand and supply.
Next, we provide the joint energy-data rate outage prob-
ability for the case where a UE-side zeRIS harvests energy
through the TS method.
Proposition 5: The joint energy-data rate outage probability
when the TS method is applied can be approximated as
PTS
U≈1
Γ(kTS)γÅ
kTS,max ( w3, w4)
θTSã
. (40)Proof: Following a similar procedure with Proposition
4, by substituting (8), (9), and (10) in (15), and after some
algebraic manipulations, the joint energy-data rate outage
probability can be written as
PTS
U= Pr ( Z2≤w3∪Z2≤w4). (41)
By using the moment-matching technique as presented in
Proposition 1 , the joint energy-data rate outage probability
can be derived as in (40), which concludes the proof.
Remark 5: Similarly with the UE-side PS method, by setting
w3andw4equal, the joint-energy-data rate outage probability
can be minimized. Therefore, by following some algebraic
manipulations, we arrive at
τ∗
U−ζσ2+ (NPe+Pcirc)Grl2
NPe+ 2Rthr
1−τ∗
Uζσ2= 0, (42)
from which the optimal splitting factor τ∗
Ucan be obtained
numerically, minimizing the joint energy-data rate outage
probability for the UE-side TS case. This equation further un-
derscores the trade-off between EH and information decoding.
Finally, we derive the joint energy-data rate outage prob-
ability for the case where a UE-side zeRIS applies the ES
method for EH.
Proposition 6: The joint energy-data rate outage probability
when the ES method is applied can be approximated by (43)
at the top of the next page.
Proof: Similarly with the PS and TS methods, by substi-
tuting (12), (13), and (14) in (15), the joint energy-data rate
outage probability can be expressed as
PES
U= Pr N1X
i=1|h1i| ≤w5∪NX
j=N1+1|h1j| ≤w6!
. (44)
As it can be observed, the RVs that are upper bounded in (44)
are different and independent of each other, due to the fact that
different reflecting elements perform the absorption and the
beam-steering functionality. Therefore, the above probability
can be rewritten as
PES
U= Pr N1X
i=1|h1i| ≤w5!
+ Pr NX
j=N1+1|h1j| ≤w6!
−Pr N1X
i=1|h1i| ≤w5!
Pr NX
j=N1+1|h1j| ≤w6!
.(45)
Again, considering that N1andN2are not necessarily large,
by following the same procedure as in Proposition 3 , (43) can
be derived, which concludes the proof.
Similar to the BS-side ES case, (43) takes into account
that different zeRIS reflecting elements have distinct roles
in absorption and data transmission, which significantly af-
fects the joint outage probability. Hence, (41) emphasizes the
critical importance of optimizing zeRIS element allocation to
simultaneously improve both energy efficiency and data rate
performance in the network.8

IV. N UMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we evaluate the performance of a down-
link zeRIS-assisted communication scenario in terms of joint
energy-data rate outage probability and energy efficiency.
Specifically, both the BS-side and UE-side zeRIS cases are
investigated in terms of joint energy-data rate outage perfor-
mance, and the most appropriate HaR method to be applied
in both cases is determined in terms of energy efficiency. In
order to derive the numerical results, we set the parameters of
the analyzed system model as shown in Table I. It should
be highlighted that κis set to be 3 in order to describe
a wireless propagation environment with non-isotropically
distributed scatterers that impact the phase of the received
signal [36]. Furthermore, unless otherwise stated, the transmit
power Ptis set at 0.5W, while the channel affected by
small-scale fading in both BS-side and UE-side scenarios
is assumed to follow Nakagami- mdistribution with shape
parameter m= 2 and scale parameter Ω = 1 . In addition,
the path loss exponent of the channel affected by small-scale
fading in the aforementioned scenarios is set equal to 2.5,
while the values of the reflecting elements’ consumption and
the zeRIS controller consumption are set as in [33]. Finally,
we employ Monte Carlo simulations to verify the accuracy
of the derived analytical results, where the simulation results
are illustrated as marks, whereas the analytical results are
illustrated as solid and dashed lines.
Fig. 2a illustrates the performance of a BS-side zeRIS-
assisted network for the case where the zeRIS harvests energy
through the PS method. In more detail, the joint energy-data
rate outage probability is illustrated versus the PS factor ρfor
different values of N, representing the number of reflecting
elements in the zeRIS. It should be mentioned that for the
BS-side zeRIS case, it is assumed that the BS-zeRIS distance
d1is set equal to 20 m, and the zeRIS-UE distance d2is
set equal to 40 m. As it can be observed, the analytical and
numerical results coincide, which validates the accuracy ofthe derived analysis. Furthermore, it can be seen that a higher
number of reflecting elements in the zeRIS plays a critical role
in reducing the required power for EH. Specifically, the joint
energy-data rate outage probability approaches unity for large
values of ρ, indicating a data rate outage phenomenon. This
behavior can be attributed to the fact that as ρ→1, the received
SNR tends to zero, leading to degraded data rate performance.
Therefore, Fig. 2a highlights the importance of optimizing the
design of the zeRIS, as well as the selection of ρfor efficient
zeRIS-assisted wireless communication systems.
Figs. 2b and 2c depict the joint energy data rate outage prob-
ability of a BS-side zeRIS-assisted network for the cases where
the zeRIS absorbs energy through the TS and ES methods,
respectively. It can be observed that the TS method exhibits a
range of τvalues that result in low outage probabilities, which
becomes narrower as Ndecreases, while similarly, the ES
method shows the same trend for the set of ν=N1/Nvalues.
Specifically, when N= 225 , the set of τvalues that yield
favorable joint energy-data rate probabilities is considerably
narrow for the TS method, while for the ES method, no value
of the ratio νleads to satisfactory performance in terms of
outage probability. Notably, the optimal values of τandνfor
joint energy-data rate outage probability vary with increasing
N. This emphasizes the need to apply each HaR method in
consideration of the available number of reflecting elements,
N. Finally, it is noticeable that, in a similar manner to the
PS method, as either τorνapproaches 1, the resulting joint
energy-data rate outage probability also becomes equal to
unity.
Fig. 3a presents the effect of the PS factor ρon the
joint energy-data rate outage probability of a UE-side zeRIS-
assisted communication network. It is worth noting that in the
UE-side zeRIS case, d1is set to 40 m, while d2is set to
20 m. Similarly with the BS-side zeRIS case, increasing the
number of reflecting elements Nexpands the set of ρvalues
that result in optimal performance. However, to achieve low
outage probability, Nandρneed to be larger compared to
theBS-side zeRIS case. This implies that the performance of
aUE-side zeRIS-assisted network is not symmetric to that
of a BS-side zeRIS-assisted network, even when the system
parameters are set to be the same in both cases, which does
not hold for a single RIS-assisted network. Furthermore, it is
noteworthy that the range of ρvalues that enable low outage
probability is narrower in the UE-side zeRIS case compared to
theBS-side zeRIS case. For instance, when N= 1100 in the
UE-side zeRIS case, to achieve an outage probability lower
than 10−6,ρmust fall within the range [0.68,0.99], while in
the case of N= 275 in the BS-side zeRIS case, ρmust be
within the range [0.41,0.93]. Hence, despite the fact that Nis9

four times larger in the UE-side scenario compared to the BS-
side case, the range of ρvalues is narrower. This highlights
the importance of carefully selecting the number of reflecting
elements Nand the PS factor ρbased on the specific zeRIS
deployment scenario.
Figs. 3b and 3c depict the joint outage probability of energy
and data rate for the UE-side zeRIS case, when the TS and ES
methods are applied. The results indicate that a higher number
of reflecting elements Nis required in both the TS and ES
methods for the UE-side zeRIS case compared to the BS-side
zeRIS case, to achieve a low joint energy-data rate outage
probability. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that increasing
the value of Nexpands the range of values for the parameters
τ(for the TS method) and ν(for the ES method) that result in a
low outage probability. Notably, even by selecting the smallest
examined value of N, i.e., N= 1050 , the TS method fails to
achieve a joint energy-data rate outage probability lower than
10−6, unlike the ES method. Conversely, in the BS-side case,
by selecting the smallest examined value of N, i.e., N= 225 ,
there exists a small range of τvalues that can achieve low joint
energy-data rate outage probability, while for the ES method,
there is no value of νthat can achieve the same. Therefore, it
can be concluded that the number of zeRIS elements as well
as the zeRIS location affect the optimal HaR method.
Fig. 4 illustrates the minimum required number of reflecting
elements, Nmin, to achieve a joint energy-data rate outage
probability lower than or equal to 10−6in both BS-side and
UE-side zeRIS deployment scenarios, for the case where therate threshold Rthr= 3.46bit/s/Hz. Specifically, in both BS-
side and UE-side setups, the PS method consistently stands
out by requiring the fewest reflecting elements than both the
TS and ES methods. In addition, an interesting observation in
both cases is the inverse relationship between the BS-zeRIS
distance and Nmin, emphasizing the paramount importance of
the EH link over the communication link in zeRIS operation.
Additionally, the performance asymmetry between UE-side
and BS-side zeRIS-assisted networks is evident, with the
former requiring a significantly higher number of reflecting
elements. Finally, Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b highlight a widening
gap in Nminbetween PS and TS and between PS and ES,
respectively, while the difference between TS and ES in
both figures narrows, indicating potential scenarios where one
method might require fewer reflecting elements.
In Fig. 5, we examine the normalized energy efficiency
Eq2
Bof a BS-side zeRIS-assisted network, with respect to the
transmit power Pt. For this analysis, we consider a BS-side
zeRIS configuration equipped with 275 reflecting elements and
a rate threshold set at Rthr= 3.46bit/s/Hz. We delve into
two distinct propagation conditions: i) a scenario with LoS
component described by the parameters m= 2andκ= 3, and
ii) a non-LoS scenario, where m= 1andκ= 0. Our primary
objective is to identify the most appropriate HaR method that
effectively balances power efficiency and reliable communi-
cation. To do so, we determine the optimal PS factor ρ, time
splitting factor τ, and the proportion of elements allocated for
energy harvestingN1

energy efficiency. As it can be observed, while the PS method
stands out for energy efficiency in the LoS scenario, it does
not perform as well in NLoS situations. In contrast, both the
TS and ES methods showcase consistent performance across
different link conditions. Particularly, the efficiency of the
PS method within the BS-side zeRIS context is significantly
influenced by propagation conditions, highlighting the need to
consider the propagation environment when selecting a HaR
method.
Finally, accordingly to the BS-side zeRIS case, Fig. 6
depicts the normalized energy efficiency of the UE-side zeRIS-
assisted system as a function of the transmit power Ptfor
twoRthr= 3.46cases where i) Rthr= 3.46bit/s/Hz, and
ii)Rthr= 1 bit/s/Hz. Initially, it can be observed that a UE-
side zeRIS requires more reflecting elements than a BS-side
zeRIS, which highlights the fact that the performance of a UE-
side zeRIS-assisted system is not symmetric with its BS-side
equivalent, in contrast to a conventional RIS-assisted system.
Specifically, for the case where Rthr= 3.46bit/s/Hz, the ES
method outperforms TS which contradicts the BS-side zeRIS
case, while the PS method illustrates the best performance
among the examined HaR methods. Finally, for the case where0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.605101520

V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this research, we delved into zeRISs’ capabilities to el-
evate energy-efficient communications for upcoming wireless
networks and provided closed-form expressions for the joint
energy-data rate outage probability and energy efficiency in
both BS-side andUE-side zeRIS deployments. These expres-
sions are instrumental in analyzing the performance of zeRIS-
assisted networks. Emphasizing the significance of informed
HaR method choices, our results showcase that zeRIS-assisted
systems can be adeptly tailored to meet varied application
demands, prioritizing energy conservation. Using PS, TS,
and ES as HaR options, we pinpointed the vital roles of
reflecting element count and zeRIS-HaR method selection in
performance enhancement. The optimal HaR strategy leans
on zeRIS placement, UE’s target rate, and the propagation
environment, and while PS often leads in energy efficiency,
the balance between PS, TS, and ES is pivotal for system-
specific conditions. Differing from conventional RIS systems,11
the performance of UE-side zeRIS doesn’t mirror its BS-
side counterpart, even with matching parameters. As a future
direction, exploring the integration of active RISs, given their
unique energy characteristics into the zeRIS paradigm presents
a compelling field for research.

As it can be observed, the RVs that are upper-bounded in
(46) are different and independent from each other, due to the
fact that the zeRIS-UE channel’s phase arg(h2i)is a circular
RV that is independent and not identically distributed with the
channel gain |h2i|, which is assumed to be a Nakagami- mRV .
In more detail, by taking into account the model proposed
in [36], the phase of a channel that describes a wireless link
with both LoS and non-LoS components (e.g., Nakagami- m
channel), can be described as an RV with a probability density
function (PDF) equal to
fp(θ) =eκcos(θ)

Additionally, δ(·)is the Dirac function, and kappa is the
von Mises concentration parameter, which characterizes the
width of the interval of phase values associated with the
arriving signals, and describes the effect of the propagation
environment on the arriving phases at the UE. Therefore, (46)
