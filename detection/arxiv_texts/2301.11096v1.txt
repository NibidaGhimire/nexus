To phase-out fossil fuels, energy systems must shift to renewable electricity as the main source
of primary energy. In this paper, we analyze how electriﬁcation can support the integration of

80%. Flexible operation of electrolyzers has the most signiﬁcant impact accounting for 42% of
the reduction in residual peak-load and 59% in residual demand. District heating networks and

1 Introduction
International governments are pursuing diﬀerent strategies to combat climate change and keep global warming
"well below 2 degrees [...] compared to pre-industrial levels" , as stated in the Paris Climate Agreement [1]. Yet,
policieshavetwocommondenominators: First,expandingelectricitygenerationfromwindorphotovoltaic(PV),and
second, utilizing more electricity in the heating, transport, or industry sector.
ElectricitygenerationfromwindandPVisforinstanceattheheartoftheEuropeanUnion’senergypolicy,partof
the Inﬂation Reduction Act by the US government, and a key element of the Chinese energy strategy [2, 3, 4]. Wind
and solar oﬀer a great technical potential, exceeding global primary consumption at least three times, and declined in
levelized costs by 70% and 90% over the past ten years, respectively [5, 6]. In some countries, wind and PV already
constituteamajorshareofpowergeneration,forinstance,50%inDenmarkor32%inGermanyin2021[7]. However,
further increasing these shares and completely phasing out fossil fuels, planned in Germany until 2035, remains a
challenge, because wind and PV power are weather dependent and ﬂuctuate over time and location [8]. As a result,
highersharesrequirecomplementarytechnologiesthatcanﬂexiblysecuresupply,likestoragesystems,carbon-neutral
thermal plants, or transmission infrastructure [9, 10].
Optionstoutilizeelectricityasaprimaryenergysourceeitherconsumeelectricitydirectlyorindirectlyviasynthetic
fuels produced from electricity. The speciﬁc strategies vary by sector: Inresidentialheating, most policies encourage
a shift to electric heat pumps; in transport, to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and to some extent power fuels [3, 2,
11, 12]. In the industry, the strategy is to either electrify suitable processes directly or utilize synthetic fuels, most
prominently hydrogen [13]. Energy policy promotes electriﬁcation, because it is already cost competitive in a lot of
cases, for instance in heating or transport, and non-emitting alternatives are scares [14]. Biomass only has a limited
sustainable potential between 100 and 300EJ, far from suﬃcient to satisfy global demand [5]. Carbon capturing, if
available, will most likely be limited to industrial applications.

Overall, electriﬁcation decisively shapes the demand renewable wind and solar must supply. It impacts the to-
tal level, the pattern, and the elasticity of electricity demand—and therefore, to what extent ﬂexible technologies,
for instance storage, must complement renewables [15]. As a result, diﬀerent options for electriﬁcation set diﬀerent
requirements for electricity supply. Heat pumps for example have a temperature-dependent eﬃciency that drives up
consumptioninwinterwhenPVgenerationislowest[16]. Therefore,theyrequireseasonalstorageormoreinvestment
inwindgenerationthatpeaksinwinteraswell[17]. Heatingwithsyntheticfuelsontheotherhandmitigatesﬂexibility
needs, but its low eﬃciency increases the total electricity demand.
In this paper, we analyze how electriﬁcation can support the integration of ﬂuctuating renewables and mitigate
the need for storage and thermal backup plants. For this purpose, we apply a comprehensive yet highly detailed
energysystemplanningmodel. Itappliesanhourlytemporalandsub-nationalspatialresolutiontoaccuratelycapture

batteries and thermal plants or mitigated by pairing heat-pumps with local heat storage or even switching to other
heating systems, like hydrogen boilers or district heating.
Thankstothismethodology,theconsiderationofﬂexibilityoptionsinourstudyiscomprehensive. Mostprevious
research excludes relevant options creating a positive bias toward the considered alternatives. For instance, several
studies on renewable integration are limited to supply-side options and exclude transmission or electriﬁcation, poten-
tially overestimating the need for storage and ﬁrm capacity [18, 19, 20, 21]. More advanced analyses do consider
electriﬁcation—but only in a single sector. For instance, some studies exclusively consider synergies between renew-
able electricity and the generation of synthetic fuels, most importantly hydrogen [22, 23, 24]. Other studies analyze
how electric mobility beneﬁts renewable integration [25, 26, 27], or solely focus on ﬂexibility from residential and
districtheating[28,29,30,31]. Finally,therearestudiesthatdocoverseveralsectorsbutlimittheanalysistoasingle

Comparedtothefewstudiesthatdoconsiderstorage,electriﬁcation,andtransmission,ouranalysisismoredetailed

and novel methods to represent operational restrictions on the consumer level. On this basis, we are able to visualize
and quantify the contribution each sector makes to the system’s ﬂexibility.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The next section 2 describes the general methodology and

section 3 presents the speciﬁc case study, a fully renewable European energy system, that the model is applied to.
Section 4 presents the results of the model including an in-depth analysis of system ﬂexibility based on residual load

appendix provides additional details on the deployed model and its results.
2 Methodology
Fortheanalysis,weapplyalinearoptimizationmodelthatdecidesontheexpansionandoperationoftechnologies
to satisfy ﬁnal energy demand. The model’s objective is to minimize total system costs consisting of annualized
expansionandoperationalcostsfortechnologiesandcostsofenergyimportsfromoutsidethesystem. Expansionand
operation in the model cover both technologies for the generation, conversion, or storage of energy carriers and grid
infrastructure to exchange energy between diﬀerent regions.
Themodeldeploysagraph-basedformulationspeciﬁcallydevelopedtomodelhighsharesofﬂuctuatingrenewables
and sector integration, which is capable to vary temporal and spatial resolution within a model [37]. Thanks to this
feature,highresolutionscanbeappliedwherethesystemissensitivetosmallimbalancesofsupplyanddemand—for
instance, in the power sector, while more inert parts, like transmission of gas or hydrogen, are modeled at a coarser
resolution. Thismethoddoesnotonlyreducecomputationalcomplexitybutcanalsocaptureinherentﬂexibilityinthe
energy system, for instance in the gas grid.
Eqs. 1 to 3c provide a stylized formulation of the underlying optimization problem. In all equations, variables
are written in upper- and parameters in lower-case letters. Regarding expansion, the model decides on capacities K
for generation, storage, and exchange; with regard to operation on quantities for generation G, useU, storageS, and

Finally, the balances in Eqs. 3a to 3c restrict the operational variables. First, the energy balance in Eq. 3a ensures
that supply meets the demand dat all times, in each region, and for each energy carrier. Eq. 3b controls how tech-
nologies convert energy carriers setting the amount of generated energy Gto the product of utilized energy Uand
the eﬃciency . The storage balance in Eq. 3c tracks the storage level Slvlwhich connects the storage balance in the

To achieve high detail and comprehensive scope, the model makes several simplifying assumptions that are com-
monintheliteratureandfoundnottoimposeasigniﬁcantbiasonresults. First,themodeldoesnotconsideroperational
restrictions of individual power plants, like ramping rates or start-up times, and the need for ancillary services, like
balancing reserves. Previous studies agree that such operational detail has little impact on results if models include
optionsforshort-termﬂexibility,likebatteriesordemand-sideresponse,andconcludemodelingofrenewablesystems
should rather prioritize temporal and spatial detail [38, 39, 40, 41]. Second, the model uses a transport instead of
a power ﬂow formulation to represent grid operation. Previous research found this simpliﬁcation to be suﬃciently
accurate [42]. In addition, model parameterization uses net-transfer capacities (NTCs) already reﬂecting power ﬂow
restrictions instead of physical grid capacities, as detailed in section 3.
The following two subsections describe how the model captures operational restrictions and ﬂexibility related to
electriﬁcation in heating and transport extending the stylized model formulation above. Model speciﬁcs beyond the
mathematical formulation, like considered regions, technologies, and sectors, will follow in section 3. The appendix

2.1 Operation of heating systems
The diﬀerent technological options to electrify the supply for process and space heat also aﬀect the ﬂexibility of
electricity demand diﬀerently. Indirect electriﬁcation using synthetic fuels is generally the most ﬂexible. Electrolysis
or other processes can easily adapt to renewable supply and store their products for later consumption. In contrast,
Göke et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 3 of 23Flexible electriﬁcation
the direct use of electricity with heat-pumps or electric boilers is more energy-eﬃcient but also more constrained.
Speciﬁc constraints diﬀer depending on whether systems provide industry, residential, or district heat and operate in
combination with heat storage. In the following, we describe how the model captures these diﬀerent constraints.
First, applying the graph-based approach, industry, residential, and district heat use a four-hour resolution repre-
senting their inherent ﬂexibility. This means, that while the energy balance is an hourly constraint for electricity, for
heat, supply does not have to equal demand in each hour but over the sum of four hours. In residential heating, this
resolution captures the thermal inertia of buildings [44]; in district heating, the inertia of the network itself [45]; and
in industrial heating, the possibility to reschedule processes.
Fig. 1 illustrates the concept comparing the electricity demand of an electric boiler providing process heat for an
hourlyandfour-hourresolution. Inthehourlycase,theelectricitydemandoftheboilerisﬁxedaccordingtothehourly
time-series. Inthefour-hourcase,thedemandisﬂexiblebutstillsubjecttotwoconstraints. Thetotaldemandforeach

time-seriesareequalinsizeineachfour-hourperiod. And,evenwithafour-hourresolutionforheat,electricitydemand
isstillanhourlyvariableandsubjecttoanhourlycapacityconstraint. Thisconstraint’simpactgreatlydependsonthe
total utilization within the speciﬁc time-step. For instance, in the four-hour period from hours 36 to 40, the electric
boiler must achieve an average utilization rate of 97.5%. As a result, the most ﬂexible operation possible is to operate
at 90% utilization in one hour and at full capacity in the others.

Second, the model introduces a diﬀerent operational concept for industrial and residential heating systems. In
contrast to the power sector, systems for industrial or residential heating are locally bound and do not feed generation
into a transmission network. Instead, they must directly match local demand. On this small-scale, the operation of
base- and peak-load plants is not cost eﬃcient, and so the proﬁle of demand directly dictates operation.
Toaccountforthisrestriction,themodelhastwodiﬀerentwaystodescribetheoperationoftechnologies. Eqs.4a
and 4b provide the formulation for the common case of technologies interacting within a network. The formulation
consists of an energy balance that ensures the summed generation Gfrom all technologies iequals the demand dat
each time-step tand a capacity constraint that limits the output of each technology to the installed capacity Kin each
time-stept. In the problem formulation above, these constraints correspond to Eq. 3a and Eq. 2a, respectively.

In contrast, Eqs. 5a and 5b describe the case of unconnected technologies each operating to match local demand
individually. Instead of an energy balance for each time-step, a single capacity balance ensures that the installed
capacitycanmeetpeakdemand p. Thesecondequationﬁxestheoperationoftechnologiesineachtime-stepaccording
to the demand proﬁle, which corresponds to the ratio of current demand to peak demand. Since this formulation
replaces the energy balances for each time-step with a single constraint on capacity and the inequality constraint for

capacity with an equality constraint, it also reduces the complexity of the optimization model.É

Forinstance,residentialhydrogenboilerscouldbebuilttorunatverylowutilizationandprovideadditionalheatwhen

heating systems in their homes.
Accordingly, in the model, technologies providing process or space heat use the must-run formulation; technolo-
gies providing electricity, hydrogen, and synthetic gas the merit-order formulation. District heat uses the merit-order
formulation as well to capture how the operation of diﬀerent plants within heating networks is ﬂexible. On the other
hand, substations that transfer district heat to ﬁnal industrial or residential consumers and determine the demand for
district heating use the must-run formulation.
Finally, the model can invest in heat storage to add ﬂexibility. For district heating, the implementation of storage
is straightforward and analogous to carriers like electricity or hydrogen. For space and process heating, viz. local
technologies using the must-run formulation, the storage is directly embedded into the speciﬁc heating technology.
This setup again prevents inconsistencies resulting from the interplay of unconnected local technologies, like heat
storage charged by hydrogen boilers but discharging to consumers with heat-pumps.
Fig. 3 describes this concept for an electric heat-pump. The upper row illustrates how the heat-pump converts
electricity to heat in a ratio equal to the coeﬃcient of performance (COP). The vertical lines indicate the capacity

are not viable with local heat storage.

2.2 Charging of BEVs
The ﬂexibility of BEVs in future energy systems is still subject to uncertainty and depends on technological and
regulatory developments. In this study, we make a middle-ground assumption on the ﬂexibility of electricity demand
from BEVs. On the one hand, we assume charging to be ﬂexible within limits and can adapt to supply which does

hand,wedonotassumethatBEVscanfeedelectricitybacktothegrid,alsotermedbidirectionalchargingorvehicle-
to-grid, which requires bidirectional chargers [47].
Fig. 4 demonstrates how the model implements ﬂexible charging based on an exemplary driving and charging
pattern for private passenger cars. First, an hourly proﬁle restricts the charging of BEVs to reﬂect the capacity of
vehicles currently connected to the grid. Second, on each day the electricity chargedmust match the consumption for
driving. Consequentially,areasaboveandbelowthecurveforconsumptionareequalinsizeforeachday,analogously
to Fig. 1. Instead of explicitly modeling battery levels, this approach implicitly assumes that on average batteries can
balance charging and consumption over one day at least.

To implement the approach, transport services use a daily resolution in the model. Conversely, other electricity
demand for transport, for instance for rail transport, is inﬂexible and uses an hourly resolution.

4.1 Energy balances
TheSankeydiagraminFig.8illustratesenergyﬂowsinthesolvedmodel. Ontherightside,thediagramshowsthe
ﬁnal demand for energy and transport services. Going from right to left, the diagram details how the model deploys
conversionprocesses,storage,andsecondaryenergycarrierstomeetthedemandfromprimaryenergysources. Tobe
clear and concise, the diagram aggregates individual technologies, like diﬀerent types of BEVs, into one node. The
ratio of ﬂows entering and leaving a node reﬂects the average eﬃciency of the underlying technology. For instance,
heat-pumps have eﬃciencies greater than one and the generated heat exceeds the electricity consumed, so outgoing
ﬂowsexceedincomingﬂows. Technologiescanhavemultiplein-andoutputs,likealkalielectrolysis,whichproduces
hydrogen but also provides waste heat to district heating networks. For storage, incoming and outgoing ﬂows relate
to the same energy carrier, though outgoing ﬂows are smaller reﬂecting storage losses. Overall, the results show a
clear emphasis on direct electriﬁcation in the heating, transport, and industry sector. In space and district heating,
heat-pumps and electric boilers provide 99.5% of the total demand. The transport sector uses BEVs and overhead
lineswhereverpossibleandsyntheticcarriersonlycovertheexogenousdemandfortransportfuels. Althoughindirect
electriﬁcationusinghydrogenisanoptiontocreatethesefuels,themodelpredominantlyutilizestheavailablebiomass
potential instead. Overall, indirect electriﬁcation is only relevant in process heating above 100 °C, which accounts
for 85% of the total hydrogen demand. This is partly due to the limited potential of direct electriﬁcation at these
temperature levels. Nevertheless, only 73% of the electriﬁcation potential is utilized suggesting that in some cases
the model deploys indirect over direct electriﬁcation despite its ineﬃciency because it is more ﬂexible. Generating

While the general prevalence of direct electriﬁcation aligns with previous research, our results deviate in several
details. First, the endogenous share of district heating is close to the upper limit and exceeds ﬁxed shares in previous
studies[28,35]. Ourmethodologycapturinghowdistrictheatingismoreﬂexiblethanindividualheatingpresumably
drives these results. Second, thermal plants only provide 25.6TWh of ﬁrm generation, much less than in previous
deep decarbonization studies limited to the power system and a single region [18, 20]. This suggests electriﬁcation
and transmission greatly contribute to renewable integration and substitute thermal backup plants.
The results mapped in Fig.9 highlight the importance of transmission. The ﬁgure shows the net-exchange for
diﬀerent transmission infrastructures and electricity generation and demand by country.

This indicates that a key driver of grid expansion is to balance local ﬂuctuations of renewable supply.

or Romania, have a comparative advantage in producing hydrogen due to high capacity factors and are exclusively

domestic hydrogen production is cost-eﬃcient and hydrogen imports from outside of Europe are negligible totaling
3.2TWh imported by Italy and the UK.
4.2 Residual load curves
While the previous section only indicates how the system achieves the integration of ﬂuctuating renewables, this
section provides a deﬁnite analysis based on residual load curves.
Residual load curves show total demand minus ﬂuctuating renewable generation sorted in descending order and
depict the energy that sources other than ﬂuctuating renewables must supply [61]. The y-axis intercept of the curve

Germany, the country with the highest demand and a relatively small renewable potential.

in 3,491 hours resulting in 205.5TWh of excess generation.

munication of the results.
The impact of ﬂexible space and process heating is small and only reduces residual peak-load by 4.3GW and
residual demand by 2.0TWh. Correspondingly, the model does not invest in local heat storage. The inﬂuence of
ﬂexibledistrictheatingismuchmorepronouncedreducingpeak-loadby29.4GWandresidualdemandby38.7TWh.
At the same time, excess generation only decreases by 36.3TWh because heat-pumps can shift operation to periods
withhighereﬃciencies. Toachievethisﬂexibility,themodelbuilds40.5TWhofthermalwaterstorageandcombined

well. Residual peak-load decreases by 18.2GW and residual demand by 28.7TWh.
The ﬂexible operation of electrolyzers displayed in Fig. 10(c) has the greatest impact on residual demand. When
electrolyzers adapt to supply instead of operating at constant capacity, residual peak-load decreases by 37.8GW and
residual demand by 98.1TWh. In this case, 82.8GW of electrical electrolyzer capacity operate at a utilization rate of
44.4%. To match volatile hydrogen production with demand, the model invests in 13.0TWh of hydrogen storage in
salt caverns, still only 0.1% of the total storage potential in Germany [63].
Intotal,ﬂexibleelectriﬁcationhasasubstantialeﬀectreducingresidualpeak-loadfrom178.2to88.5GW,residual
demand from 338.3 to 170.8TWh, and excess generation from 205.5 to 41.9TWh. Fig. 10(d) ﬁnally shows how the
system meets the residual demand. In line with the results in the previous section, transmission covers the major
portion. Atpeak-loadGermanyimports52.8GW,whichcorrespondsto96%ofthetotalimportcapacity. Importsalso

storage are less important. Thermal plants cover 25.2GW of peak-load and provide 8.8TWh of generation, almost
equally divided between open-cycle (OC) hydrogen turbines and gas engines. For electricity storage, the model does

excess generation being ﬁnally curtailed.
In the presented scenario, the power grid is the greatest source of ﬂexibility, both on the supply and demand side,
and NTC capacities almost triple. But grid expansion frequently faces public opposition and under extreme weather
conditions total generation can be insuﬃcient to balance out local shortages. To check the robustness of our results
against this background, we solve the model for an additional scenario without any grid expansion. General results

Results on the demand side are similar to the reference scenario and ﬂexible electriﬁcation reduces the residual peak-
load from 173.9 to 91.4GW and the residual demand from 317.7 to 110.0TWh. The only substantial diﬀerence is
a greater contribution from ﬂexible PtX that decreases residual demand by 139.4 instead of 98.1TW in the previous
scenario. Correspondingly,hydrogenproductionincreasesby10.0TWhandutilizationofelectrolyzersdropsby3.4%

On the supply side, diﬀerences between scenarios are more pronounced and thermal plants largely substitute im-
ports. Compared to the reference scenario, thermal plants cover 78.9 instead of 25.2GW of the residual peak-load,
while imports drop from 52.8 to 8.9GW. Total contribution to residual demand changes accordingly increasing from
8.8 to 36.2TWh for thermal plants but decreasing from 153.2 to 43.0TWh for imports. Similar to the reference sce-
nario, thermal generation is almost equally divided between hydrogen turbines and gas engines.
As a contrast to Germany, Fig. 12 shows residual load curves for Norway. Due to the exceptional Norwegian
hydro resources, ﬂuctuating renewables only supply 37.9% of electricity, compared to 99.2% in Germany. The model

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we analyze ﬂexible electriﬁcation in energy systems that rely on wind and solar as the main source
of primary energy. Using a cost minimizing system model, we ﬁnd substantial beneﬁts of secondary demand from
heating,transport,andindustryadaptingtoﬂuctuatingsupply. InGermany,ﬂexibledemandhalvestheresidualpeak-
load, halves the residual demand, and reduces excess generation by 80%. Flexible operation of electrolyzers has the
greatest impact and accounts for 42% of the reduction in residual peak-load and 59% in residual demand. District
heating networks and BEVs provide substantial ﬂexibility as well; the contribution of space and process heating is
negligible. Leveraging this ﬂexibility is cost-eﬃcient but requires additional investments into systems for the storage
and generation of hydrogen and heat.
To what extent ﬂexible electriﬁcation is beneﬁcial to reduce the residual load also depends on the availability
of supply-side options to cover the residual load. Our analysis considers thermal plants, electricity storage, and the
transmissiongrid. Inthereferencecase,thelatterisgreatlyexpandedandcoversmostoftheresidualdemand. Without
gridexpansion,themodeldeploysmorethermalplantsbutdoesnotsubstantiallyincreaseinvestmentindemand-side
ﬂexibility. Incasethesupply-sidealreadyhasasurplusofﬂexibility,thereisnoinvestmentintodemand-sideﬂexibility
at all. For instance, in Norway storage for hydrogen or heat is dispensable thanks to the large hydro reservoirs.
Thepurposeofourtechno-economicanalysisisnottoassessthelevelofﬂexibilityconceivableundercurrentpol-
icy and market conditions. Instead, we identify where eﬀorts to leverage the ﬂexibility potential promise the greatest
beneﬁts. In light of our results, policy should prioritize the integration of electricity and hydrogen markets. Only if
hydrogenproductionissensitivetoelectricityprices,operatorsofelectrolyzershaveanincentivetoadapttorenewable
supply. The next priority is integrating district heating, followed by incentives for ﬂexible charging of BEVs. Addi-
tional ﬂexibility on the consumer level not only faces practical obstacles concerning privacy, automated control, and
commercial aggregators but also has the smallest beneﬁt on the system level.
Forouranalysis,itwaskeytoconsiderabroadrangeofﬂexibilityoptionsandapplyahighlevelofdetailtospatio-
temporal ﬂuctuations of renewables. Nevertheless, future research can expand these qualities. Regarding ﬂexibility,

[66]. Regardingdetail,extendingtheanalysistocovermultipleclimaticyearsandincludeextremeweatherconditions

A Detailed model structure
This section provides a comprehensive overview of all technologies and energy carriers considered in the model
usinggraphslikeFig.7inthemainpartofthepaper. Inthesegraphs,verticeseitherrepresentenergycarriers,depicted
as colored squares, or technologies, depicted as gray circles. Entering edges of technologies refer to input carriers;
outgoing edges refer to outputs. For illustrative purposes, Fig 13 shows the graph of all carriers and technologies. In
the following, subgraphs of this graph are used to go into further detail.

Göke et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 17 of 23Flexible electriﬁcation
Fig. 14 provides an overview of the technologies capable to supply space and district heat (DH) including their
respective input carriers or additional outputs. Supply for district heat includes air heat pumps, diﬀerent boilers,
two distinct storage systems, and a broad range of combined-heat-power (CHP) technologies, some of which, like
combined-cycle extraction turbines, can be operated ﬂexibly and—within limits—increase their electricity output at
thecostofreducedtotaleﬃciency. Inaddition,excessheatfromelectrolysisorgasifyingsolidbiomasscanbeutilized
as well. Demand for district heat is fully endogenous and induced by other technologies, for example, substations
supplying space heat.

turelevels. Low-temperatureheatrangesupto100 °C,mediumtemperaturefrom100to500 °C,andhightemperature
covers everything above 500 °C. Heating requirements within the same temperature category can greatly vary by pro-
cessandasaresult,onetechnologymightnotbeabletosatisfytheentiredemandofacertaincategory. Forinstance,
not the entire heating demand above 500 °C is eligible for electriﬁcation, because steel production in blast furnaces
requires fuel combustion. To account for such limits, heat supply from district heating, engines, and combined-cycle
gas turbines is limited to today’s level as a conservative estimate.
