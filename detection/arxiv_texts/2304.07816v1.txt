Optical generation of energetic particle bunches requires high-power laser facilities operating in picosecond or
femtosecond temporal domain. It is therefore preferable to use short laser pulses in all-optical platforms de-
signed for guiding and focusing of such particle beams, increasing their brightness and decreasing their angular
divergence. We propose and discuss theoretical and experimental results for a novel electromagnetic guiding
setup based on a shaped spiral-like ’snail’ target with a relatively large useful aperture. Due to the diameter
increased to a sub-mm scale, a wider particle bunches may be efﬁciently focused, as we show in theoretical
modelling with a model ﬁeld distributions, supported by the experimental data.
I. INTRODUCTION
Modern high-power laser facilities advanced plenty of ap-
plications based on accelerated particle beams. Along with
expectations of great prospects in energy of accelerated pro-
tons [1], fast advances are achieved in proton accelera-
tion from nanostructured targets [2–4] and from microchan-
nels [5]. The quality of particle beams from conventional
accelerators is different than that from laser-based schemes,
though the compactness and total charge in the beams for the
latter may be much higher. Among many propositions for
particle beam collimation, applying either auxiliary guiding
quasi-stationary electro-magnetic ﬁeld [6, 7] or spontaneous
ﬁeld structure, generated within the irradiated target [8–11]
are thought to be one of the most efﬁcient solutions. For
desired particle beam characteristic, the conventional elec-
tromagnets fed by a capacitor discharge bank may appear to
be either inadequate or inconvenient, however, optical gen-
erators, driven with powerful lasers, can provide sufﬁciently
strong ﬁelds and do not need a cumbersome damage protec-
tion as they are normally cheep and single-used, as well as the
targets for particle generation themselves.

many.Various approaches to strong magnetic ﬁeld generation
with powerful lasers have been explored in the literature [12].
One of the most effective and widely used mechanism for
laser excitation of magnetic ﬁeld is the generation of return,
or discharge current in a given geometry, like a single-turn
coil [13–17]. To generate a sufﬁcient potential, an interaction
region may have a capacitor-like design, though the optimal
parameters are still widely discussed. Those capacitor-coil
targets have a few-mm spatial scale and are well characterized
in experimental studies while driven by a nanosecond terawatt
laser pulse [16–23]. For short, picosecond-scale and more in-
tense drivers, the large spatial scales lead to a complicated
transient behavior like a discharge wave propagation [24, 25],
though at later times a quasi-stationary electromagnetic struc-
ture may form [25]. Though some attempts at strong mag-
netic ﬁeld generation were reported for coil targets driven by
a short, even fs laser pulse, the magnetic ﬁeld there did not ex-
ceed the value of a few tens of tesla [26, 27], limiting the use
of such systems for collimation of high energy particle ﬂows.
However, it is the short pulses that are normally used for par-
ticle acceleration, and the auxiliary electromagnetic ﬁeld gen-
erators working with short laser pulses may appear to be more
convenient, as they can use then e.g. a part of the same driver.
Recently, a novel approach for generation of quasi-
stationary electromagnetic structures, was proposed [28]. It is
in general based on a "whispering gallery effect" [29] and was
experimentally proved to work robustly both for long [30] andarXiv:2304.07816v1  [physics.plasm-ph]  16 Apr 20232
short laser pulses [31, 32], though for more intense picosec-
ond drivers, the magnetic ﬁeld appear to be much higher and
reaches values of several kilotesla [32]. Such high magnetic
ﬁeld magnitudes have previously been reached only in mag-
netic ﬂux compression setups where a seed magnetic ﬁeld is
created in a cylindrical target and is then compressed via im-
plosion driven by a powerful laser [33–35]. The scheme con-
sidered in this work is more versatile as it does not require
an external high-energy driver for obtaining &1 kT magnetic
ﬁeld. The interaction region there is itself a curved ring-like
surface, working as a current circuit in a magnetic ﬁeld gen-
eration process. Due to the fact that the laser-surface interac-
tion and magnetic ﬁeld generation occur in the same volume,
the main feature of this scheme is that it produces ﬁnally a
magnetized plasma inside the cylinder-like target volume in-
stead of the electric current bound to a conducting rod. The
plasma is conﬁned with inertia of the target material, provid-
ing a life-time of the generated ﬁelds about a hundred of pi-
coseconds [31]. Depending on the geometry of interaction and
laser pulse parameters, the magnetized plasma structure may
have different characteristics [36] and allows also to study
fundamental processes in magnetized plasma themselves, e.g.
relativistic reconnection similar to those near astrophysical X-
ray sources [32]. Some interesting applications may be based
on the described phenomenon, like e.g. hot plasma conﬁne-
ment [37] or control of particle beams, which is discussed in
this work.
The paper is organized as follows. First, we present re-
sults of the experimental study and their interpretation for
a picosecond laser pulse interaction with curved targets at
PHELIX laser facility at GSI, Darmstadt. We consider two
types of targets: the "snail"-type target with the entrance in its
upper parts, i.e. opposite to the stalk, which we call here "S6"
target, and the one with the entrance in the lower part, which
we call here "S9". We discuss the electromagnetic structure
which is formed inside the target volume of the sub-millimeter
scale. Finally, before conclusion, we consider theoretically a
possibility of focusing fast bunches of protons and relativistic
electrons with the discussed electromagnetic structure.
II. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY
The experiment was carried out at the PHELIX laser facil-
ity at GSI, Darmstadt. The targets were produced at the Tech-
nical University Darmstadt using the MEMS (Micro-Electro-
Mechanical Systems) technology. Their shapes and dimen-
sions are presented in Fig. 1 The target height (without the
stalk) was h=482mm, and the width was w=424mm. Wall
thickness was d=50mm and the depth, i.e. dimension along
the target axis, was d=100mm.
Targets used in the experiment were designed with the stalk
positioned in two different ways, as explained above, for the
S6 target and the S9 target, see Fig. 1. The S6 target photo-
graphic image is shown in the inset panel of Fig. 2. Using the
two oppositely screwed targets within the same experiment
allows to distinguish an input of the magnetic ﬁeld which is
expected to have opposite polarities in S6 and S9 targets. The

try as those used in the experiment.
A. Experimental setup
In the experiment, the laser pulse with 0.5 ps duration,
1.056 mm central wavelength and a high contrast 10 10,
was split into two equal parts named SP1 and SP2, each car-
rying about 50 J. The SP1 beam was focused by a shorter fo-
cal length parabola F=400 mm into a 10 mm FWHM (Full
Width at Half Maximum) spot on the internal surface of the
targets, as shown in Fig. 1. The expected intensity in the fo-
cal spot was a few times of 1019W/cm2. The SP2 beam was
focused by a long focal length parabola F=1500 mm into a
40mm FWHM focal spot on a thin 4 mm gold foil for gener-
ation of diagnostic protons via TNSA (Target Normal Sheath
Acceleration) mechanism [38]. A simpliﬁed scheme of the
full experimental setup is presented in Fig. 2.
The proton deﬂectometry driven by the SP2 beam was a
primary diagnostic in this experimental research. Multi-layer
Radiochromic Film (RCF) stack was used as a proton detec-
tor. The stacks consisted of 15 mm Al foil to stop heavier
particles, 5 HD-V2 RCFs (having a low sensitivity) and 10
EBT3 RCFs (having a high sensitivity). These RCFs can be3
used for quantitative dose retrieval using the existing calibra-
tion curves [39]. With different proton propagation till the
Bragg absorption peak in stacked RCFs, it is possible to ob-
tain a temporally resolved evolution of the ﬁelds in the studied
region [16].
The distance between the TNSA source and the target in
the experiment was 2 :8 mm, while the distance from the tar-
get to the front of 5 5 cm RCF stack was 111 mm, leading
to magniﬁcation factor of 40. An additional adjustable de-
lay of500 ps between SP1 and SP2 pulses allowed to study
the ﬁeld time dependence from the early moments of the in-
teraction, taking into account the proton time of ﬂight from
the TNSA foil to the target. A 1500 =inch mesh was placed
between the foil and the target at 1 :47 mm distance from the
foil for two reasons: (i) conﬁrmation, that protons are origi-
nated in the foil and not in the target itself and (ii) as a possible
additional tool for the ﬁeld evaluation. The maximum regis-
tered proton energy reached 20 MeV , though layers containing
both the target shadow, modiﬁed by the ﬁelds and distinguish-
able mesh imprint are observed only for proton energies below
10 MeV .
B. Experimental results
In the experiment, several informative RCF data sets were
obtained for both types of the targets, S6 and S9. Two ex-
emplary radiograph images are shown in Fig. 3, a. In each
case the structure, observed on the radiograph, presents a re-
gion with a low proton signal. The boundary of this region
has a cardioid shape with a distinct caustic feature either on
the upper or on the lower side of the main ’void’, depending
on the polarity of the magnetic ﬁeld, as we show below. Over-
all, these results are qualitatively similar to those observed for
smaller targets [31].
In order to analyse the radiographs and estimate the formed
electro-magnetic ﬁelds, the test-particle approach was imple-
mented. It requires calculating proton trajectories in different
model electro-magnetic ﬁeld distributions via numerical in-
tegration of the equations of motion. In this case, particles
with energies matching those that produce an imprint on the
corresponding layer of the RCF stack, were initialized at the
position of the TNSA foil and sent through the studied re-
gion. Their trajectories in this region were calculated by solv-
ing the Newton’s equations of motion with the Lorentz force
~F=e(~E+[~v~B]), with a time step 0 :2 ps. Protons with tra-
jectories intersecting the volume of the target material were
removed from the simulation to account for the shadow of the
target. Final coordinates of probe particles at the RCF plane
formed a two-dimensional array, which was used for the syn-
thetic proton radiography image construction. Electric ﬁelds
in the simulations were calculated for a conducting target with
a real geometry, charged to a certain potential, on a three-
dimensional grid with 10 mm resolution. Magnetic ﬁelds were
calculated on the same grid by deﬁning a current loop or sev-
eral loops with certain electric currents, approximated by 100
linear segments and calculated then with the Biot-Savart law.
For the initial analysis of the experimental data, the current

loop was a curve that lies on the inner surface of the target
and a straight segment that closed it in the slit region. In this
case the magnetic ﬁeld is distributed quite regularly inside the
target cavity with a certain direction, see Fig. 3, c. This simple
circuit shape provides an estimation of the average magnetic
ﬁeld magnitude in the cavity.
With the described "single current loop" approach, a set
of synthetic radiographs for a range of different values of
the target electric potential and electric current was obtained.
The images from this data set were then compared to the ex-
perimental images by calculating a two-dimensional cross-
correlation function. For each image from the set and the
analyzed experimental image the maximum value of cross-
correlation was determined. In this way, two-dimensional
cross-correlation peak maps were built. For certain values
of parameters, the correlation between experimental and syn-
thetic image is noticeably higher, which can be interpreted
as the best ﬁt to experimental values within the considered
model. Examples of synthetic images, calculated with the4
best-ﬁt parameters for radiographs, presented in Fig. 3 a,
are shown in Fig. 3 b. Since the two-dimensional correla-
tion peak is not sharp and is elongated in the direction of
theUBConst line, where Uis electrostatic potential, B
is the magnetic ﬁeld value, the best-ﬁt region has a ﬁnite
width along the both axis, resulting in uncertainties of ex-
tracted electromagnetic ﬁeld parameters. An example of the
two-dimensional correlation map, obtained for the experimen-
tal data for the S9 target, probed at 28 8 ps after the laser
pulse entrance the target, is demonstrated in Fig. 4 a, where
the best-ﬁt region is enclosed in a black contour. Similar maps
were calculated for other informative diagnostic images, and
the result, namely the temporal evolution of the average mag-
netic ﬁeld inside the cavity as well as the temporal evolution
of the electric potential of the target, is plotted as a function
of time after the laser pulse arrival in Fig. 4 b. From the plot
it can be seen that the magnetic ﬁeld inside the S9 target is
25040 T at 21 7 ps, and then it decays to 167 17 T dur-
ing the next 40 ps. Some of the informative data for the
S6 target corresponds to earlier moments of the ﬁeld temporal
evolution, when it is not yet formed, thus making its anal-
ysis in the assumption of a single current loop with a ﬁxed
shape inapplicable. For this reason, only one data point for
the latest available time moment is shown for this target. The
average ﬁeld in this case is slightly lower than for the S9 tar-
get at the same moment of time, which can be attributed to
the ﬁeld distribution over a larger area inside the target, see
Fig. 3 b, or to the worse interaction conditions, e.g. poor fo-
cusing on the inner surface of the target, resulting in a lack
of multiple reﬂections or lower laser intensity on the surface.
The electric potential for the S9 target decays faster than the
magnetic ﬁeld, changing from the initial 70 50 kV to almost
zero level at 63 11 ps. It is worth noting that extraction er-
rors for the electric potential are quite high, since it affects the
radiochromic image less than the magnetic ﬁeld, resulting in
high correlation peak width along the U-axis.
As it is discussed below, the "single current loop" approach
is not the only possible current distribution which may be at-
tributed to the experimental data. However, the reconstructed
values of the magnetic ﬁelds correctly describe both the aver-
age (integrated along the probing protons path) values and the
their temporal behaviour. So, the 0 :5 ps short laser pulse cre-
ated a quasi-stationary several-hundreds magnetic ﬁeld struc-
ture with a characteristic decay time on 100 ps level.
III. MODELLING OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC
STRUCTURE FORMATION
Interaction of a laser with a curved "snail"-type target, lead-
ing to formation of a strongly magnetized plasma inside the
target, needs focusing of the laser beam on the internal sur-
face of the target entrance, see Fig. 5. The laser pulse comes
at grazing incidence, which actually allows to transform the
initial short pulse to a long-living electromagnetic structure,
and the surface electrons are efﬁciently accelerated along the
beam direction. At the same time, in the dense target vol-
ume, where the laser ﬁeld can not penetrate, a return electron

current starts to increase to compensate a positive charge in
the interaction region. Both of these electron currents, as we
discuss below, create strong magnetic ﬁelds, which appear to
be frozen into expanding plasma and later form a magnetized
plasmoid in the target volume [28, 31]. Laser pulse follows
the target geometry and this process continues all over the sur-
face. In this interaction, a part of the most energetic electrons,
which are not magnetized, escape [11] and create a positive
charge of the whole target.
A. Simulations for the experimental parameters
To model the process of laser-target interaction, we use
open source Particle-In-Cell code Smilei [40]. For the 2D
simulations, we consider a target with a realistic geometry,
shown in Fig. 5. In simulations, target is made from copper
with a small fraction of hydrogen, aiming to take into account
a thin surface contamination layer. Simulations with the pure
copper targets were also performed and showed very similar
results. Laser parameters correspond to the PHELIX laser at
GSI, with the beam divided into two equal parts, so that the
laser energy in each is 50 J. In these simulations, initial elec-
tron density in the target is n0=1022cm 3, copper and hy-
drogen ions constitute 95% and 5%, respectively. Spatial and
temporal resolutions are 80 nm and 0 :17 fs, respectively. Each
cell has 100 electrons and 20 ions of each kind, randomly dis-
tributed in the target with initial zero temperature. Boundary
conditions are open for both ﬁelds and particles. Laser beam
with a 20 mm waist was focused almost with a grazing inci-5
dence on the target surface at the entrance as shown in Fig. 5
att=3:49 ps. Most of the simulations were performed till the
time moment of about 20 ps, when the magnetic structure is
already formed. One simulation for the S9 target was longer,
up to 50 ps to demonstrate the slow hydrodynamic nature of
the formed structure.
B. Formation of the electromagnetic structure in a cavity
The interaction process looks very similar for both S6 and
S9 targets. When the laser pulse comes into the target, it re-
ﬂects continuously along the target surface, generating accel-
erated electrons predominantly in the direction of its propa-
gation. We observe, that the propagating laser pulse is tightly
bound to the surface and propagates with the discharge pulse,
see Fig. 5. The target which is considered in this work is
larger and more ﬂattish than that considered in the original
work [28] and in the experimental study performed within the
same experimental campaign, but with a different target ge-
ometry [31]. This geometry allows to form a more symmetric
structure and to conﬁne the propagating laser pulse near the
surface. Due to a grazing propagation all over the propagation
distance, the laser pulse efﬁciently accelerates electrons, and
the current of these electrons appears to be very distinct. As
a result, outside the dense plasma region, at a distance from
the surface, a positive magnetic ﬁeld region is formed for the
S6 target (and negative for the S9 target), while in the more
dense plasma close to the surface, the direction of the ﬁeld is
opposite and corresponds to the closed circuit loop formed by
the accelerated electrons and the return current, similarly to
the previous studies.
The temporal evolution of the magnetized plasma structure
formation is presented in Fig. 5, for the S6 target in the left
column and for the S9 target in the right one. We show the
full magnetic ﬁeld in the simulation box, the laser one and the
ﬁeld in the plasma. The ﬁrst shown time moment t3:5 ps
corresponds to the start of the interaction, when the laser beam
just touched the target. In this panel, the target shape and the
laser beam direction is explicitly shown over the distribution
of the magnetic ﬁeld.
Later, at times t4:5;5:5;7:5 ps, the laser pulse propa-
gates with the discharge pulse along the internal surface of the
target. The discharge pulse also partially covers the outer sur-
face. The directions of the laser and the discharge pulses are
opposite for the S6 and S9 targets, consequently, the formed
magnetic ﬁelds have opposite directions, although qualita-
tively the distributions of the ﬁelds are very similar.
At late times of about t10 ps, both the discharge and
the laser pulses are not evidently observed in the simulation
results, see Fig. 5. Instead, a coaxial magnetized structure
in the hot plasma, expanding from the internal surface, is
formed. The central part of this structure has a much less den-
sity than the ring-shaped plasma closer to the surface, which
contains both electrons and ions. Thus the central region is
easily compressed, as seen in Fig. 5 at t12:5 ps. The
later evolution proceeds on the hydrodynamical time scale to a
quasi-equilibrium distribution of the magnetized plasma with

As mentioned above, the formation of the quasi-coaxial

lated to the ﬁne grazing conditions. In Fig. 7 symbol Fshows

represents the magnetic ﬁeld structure at late time t20 ps,
formed by a laser beam, focused slightly upper, than it was
in panels aandb, for the same S9 target. In this case, the
reﬂection of the laser beam is not perfectly grazing, which re-
sults in qualitative changes in the magnetic ﬁeld distribution.
It is now more homogeneous, although with a small part of an
oppositely magnetized plasma.
To support the reasonableness of the 2D simulations, we
performed an exemplary 3D PIC simulation with a reduced
target size. In this simulation, the target was smaller 3
times, the material and the number of particles were the same
as in the 2D simulations, the spatial and the temporal resolu-
tions were 10 nm and 0 :21 fs respectively. The result for the
magnetic ﬁeld distribution and the electron density at 6 :0 ps
are shown in Fig. 6, panel aandb, respectively. It is seen, that
the magnetic ﬁeld distribution has a co-axial structure, with
a maximum of negative ﬁeld in the central region, reproduc-
ing the results of the 2D simulations. The ﬁeld lines turn over
the target, and then in the center change their direction, the
plasma appears strongly conﬁned near the target for the con-
sidered times. This supports the use of numerical 2D model
for the general analysis presented above.
According to the PIC simulation results, the magnetic ﬁeld
structure is more complicated in the case when the grazing
conditions are suitable for binding the laser beam along the
surface. Without a tomography probing, it is difﬁcult to re-
solve the internal ﬁeld structure in the experiment, and would
be rather speculative to make certain conclusions on it. It is
however possible to reliably deﬁne the integral ﬁeld character-
istics, like the average magnetic ﬁeld value. To demonstrate
this, a set of synthetic radiograph images for diagnostic pro-
tons propagating in a more complex magnetic ﬁeld structure
was built for different values of the target potential and the
magnetic ﬁeld values, assuming the ﬁeld structure in the tar-7

get volume is similar to the calculated distribution shown in
Fig. 7. For that, two current loops with the shapes taken from
the theoretical results were introduced. The currents in each
loop, as well as the electric potential of the target, were ad-
justed to provide the highest correlation of the corresponding
synthetic image with the experimental one. Ballistic simula-
tion results, performed with such ﬁeld structure, with a good
degree of similarity reproduce both the experimental images
and those, obtained in the frame of the "single loop current"
model, see Fig. 8 a. Although without proton tomography,
which involves probing the target from multiple angles, it is
difﬁcult to reliably determine the real ﬁeld structure inside the
cavity, for some applications, e.g. particle guiding considered
in this work, both a simple uniform and a more complex co-
axial magnetic ﬁeld structures may appear suitable.
IV . POSSIBLE APPLICATION TO COLLIMATION OF
ENERGETIC PARTICLE FLOWS
As it is shown above, the curved S9 and S6 targets driven
by a picosecond petawatt-class laser driver, effectively gener-
ate the electro-magnetic ﬁeld structure in the plasma, which
ﬁlls the target interior after heating by the laser pulse. We ob-
serve that in simulations, the ﬁeld structure is sensitive to the
interaction conditions. With a ﬁne grazing reﬂection along the
internal surface, an island of a higher magnetic ﬁeld is formed
near the target center, while for larger incident angles at the
ﬁrst interaction, the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld is almost
homogeneous. In experiment, it is difﬁcult to resolve the in-
ternal ﬁeld structure, but with a reasonable accuracy, using a
cross-correlation analysis, an average magnetic ﬁeld value in
the target interior can be determined.
Now, we discuss the possibility of using those optically
generated electromagnetic ﬁeld structures for guiding of high
energy charged particle beams, considering as two examples
here MeV protons and multi-MeV electrons. A sketch of the
proposed setup for particle bunch collimation with one of the
studied targets is illustrated in Fig. 9 b. In this example, the
target must be oriented so that its axis coincides with the di-
rection of a divergent proton beam. Trajectories of protons
with non-zero transverse velocity components in such a geom-etry will take the form of helical spirals in the region of high
magnetic ﬁeld - the particles will revolve around the magnetic
ﬁeld axis, and the particle beam may be effectively focused,
forming a collimated ﬂow. This requires certain conditions,
as shown below, both for electrostatic and magnetic compo-
nents of the electromagnetic ﬁeld structure around the mag-
netized target. Surprisingly, the electrostatic ﬁeld addition-
ally enhances the collimation effect in some situations, when
the positively charged protons slightly repel from positively
charged quasi-ring target inwards.
In order to study proton collimation in the electromagnetic
ﬁeld structures, generated in snail-type targets, we employ the
same test particle method that we used to analyse the exper-
imental data. In the simulations, protons come from a point
source, located 2:9 mm away from the target centre. The
beam has a supergaussian angular proﬁle with FWHM of 10.
The detector plane is in 60 mm distance from the target plane.
Initial beam proﬁle for the case, when no external ﬁelds are
applied, is shown in Fig. 9 a. First, we consider the simple
homogeneous ﬁeld geometry, see Fig. 3 cand 3 :5 MeV pro-
ton beam. In this case, if the values of magnetic and electric
ﬁelds are close to those obtained from the experimental data
analysis, the ﬁelds considerably change the proton concentra-
tion per unit area for particles that pass the target area, but
the collimation is not perfect, see Fig. 9 c. With these ﬁelds,
a better collimation may be obtained for lower proton ener-
gies, see Fig. 9 efor protons with the energy of 0 :5 MeV . For
the considered 3 :5 MeV protons a good collimation can be
achieved, if the values of magnetic ﬁeld are scaled by a fac-
tor of 3, so that the average magnetic ﬁeld inside the cavity
reaches 750 T. Such an increase of the ﬁelds values is possi-
ble either with the increase of the invested laser energy, or, for
the same laser energy, with the decrease of the target size [31]
which may require a change of the setup geometry. As can
be seen in Fig. 9 d, under the action of such increased ﬁelds,
protons strongly redistribute and a signiﬁcant fraction of them
is focused in the central region, forming a bright spot with 3
times higher proton concentration at the detector plane. Creat-
ing average magnetic ﬁelds of 750 T with the same target ge-
ometry requires 9 times higher laser energies, that is about
450 J. Such values in picosecond regime are well within reach
for modern high power laser systems, such as, for example,
Z-petawatt laser at Sandia National Laboratories in the USA,
PETAL laser in France, or LFEX facility in Japan.
A further criterion for the applicability of the produced
electromagnetic ﬁelds is their rise and decay over time.
Achromatic electromagnetic lenses are one application that
can be realized if the focal length remains unchanged for all
projectile energies. Such lenses are important for beam col-
limation over a large spectral bandwidth, e.g. for bunching
with high frequency (HF) cavities [41]. For heuristic esti-
mates we regard the focal length of a conductive ring of ra-
dius Rat potential Uwhich holds a coiling current induc-
ing a magnetic ﬁeld B, for details see appendix A. Follow-
ing a thin lens approximation, the focal length fis constant
when aU=R+bRB2=f(t t0) 2. The proportionality fac-
torsa0:07q=mandb0:29(q=m)2result from the ring
geometry of the ﬁelds and the projectile charge to mass ra-8
tio. Perfect lensing requires a slow decay Bµ1=tand a faster
decay Uµ1=t2– a trend that is qualitatively in agreement
with the experimental data, see their respective evolution in
Fig. 4 c. Here, the experimental values are suited to maintain
a quasi-constant focal length of 2 :9 mm for protons with en-
ergies ranging from 360 keV to 380 keV launched t0=331 ps
before driving the ﬁelds. It is possible to shift the spectral
range, either by scaling the ﬁeld amplitudes or by modiﬁca-
tion of the source distance. Note, that the potential can be
decreased without altering the magnetic ﬁeld strength by de-
ploying more massive targets with the same internal geome-
try. Consider for example parametric changes that may appear
beneﬁcial to reach applicability of the platform at the same
focal length not taking into account the target potential. (I) in-
creasing the magnetic ﬁeld by 45 % yields acceptance of pro-
tons with energies ranging from 620 keV to 670 keV launched
t0=246 ps before driving the ﬁelds. An optimization of the
platform towards larger spectral acceptance may become pos-
sible by tailoring of the characteristic decay times of ﬁelds,
e.g. by changing the target material. With tailored magnetic
ﬁeld decay the temporal range of measured data allowed for
reaching lower energies down to 550 keV , the energy range
interesting for proton-Boron fusion experiments. (II) scaling
up the ﬁelds by a factor of 7 allows to maintain the constant
focal length for protons in a larger energy bin from 7 MeV to
17 MeV when launched 40 ps ahead of the ﬁeld drive, the en-
ergy range interesting for plasma accelerators aiming at med-
ical applications.
Now, consider a more complex co-axial magnetic ﬁeld
structure, observed in PIC simulation, with electromagnetic
ﬁeld parameters deduced from the experimental data, see
Fig. 8 b. It appears, that this ﬁeld proﬁle may be suited for
particle guiding as well as the homogeneous one. Accord-
ing to the results of ballistic calculations, non-scaled values
of coaxial magnetic ﬁelds, deduced from the experimental ra-
diograph are again sufﬁcient to collimate 0 :5 MeV protons.
As well, more energetic 4 :5 MeV protons can be guided if
the coaxial magnetic ﬁeld is increased by a factor of 3, see
Fig. 9 f. Taking into account the fact that electric ﬁelds also
play a signiﬁcant role in particle collimation, the requirements
on laser energy for collimation of 3:5 MeV protons with
both the homogeneous and the coaxial ﬁeld structures may
appear to be less, since the potential in this case will be higher
than 70  90 kV , deduced from the experimental data obtained
for 50 J laser pulses.
Additionally, we performed ballistic simulations with rela-
tivistic electrons to estimate in what energy range they can be
collimated with the proposed setup. In the case of the complex
coaxial magnetic ﬁeld structure with the parameters deduced
from the experimental data, already 25 MeV electrons can be
efﬁciently collimated (see Fig. 10, a). Scaling this magnetic
ﬁeld by a factor of 3 enables the collimation of 75 MeV elec-
trons (see Fig. 10, b). It should be noted that for electrons the
electric ﬁeld, acting on the particles when they travel trough
the cavity of the positively charged target, creates a force that
is directed outwards rather than inwards, as it is in the case of
protons, and thus, it leads to some decollimation.

that can be guided with the proposed setup is moving the par-
ticle source away from the target plane rather than increasing
the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld. It is based on the fact
that transverse velocity components for particles that come
from a more distant source and pass through the target cav-
ity in this case are lower, and thus less deﬂection is required
to make their trajectories parallel to the target axis. As can
be seen from Fig. 10 c, increasing the distance from the par-
ticle source to the target by 3 times allows the collimation9

from the experimental data, while the ﬁeld scaled in magni-
tude by 3 times enables the guiding of 120 MeV electrons, see
Fig. 10 d. Coming back to the homogeneous ﬁeld structure, it
has similar collimation characteristics for both short and long
focal distances. It results in slightly higher collimated parti-
cle energies, as well as slightly higher particle concentration
in the collimated spot, although the shape of the spot is more
complex than with the coaxial magnetic ﬁeld structure, see
Fig. 10 eandf. This approach of increasing the energy range
of the guided projectiles may be well suited for particle ac-
celeration schemes with initially low beam divergence, so that
the source can be moved further away from the magnetic lens
while still maintaining relatively high number of particles that
are initially sent through the high magnetic ﬁeld region. In
addition, multi-stage collimation schemes may be considered
if several laser beams are available, this situation would be
considered elsewhere.
V . CONCLUSION
In this work, the curved snail-type targets, which we called
"S6" and "S9", depending on their helicity, were shown to be
effective optical generators of strong magnetic ﬁelds with use
of picosecond petawatt-class laser facilities. The generation of
the high magnetic ﬁeld of about several hundreds of tesla with
only a 50 J laser pulse was observed both in simulations and
experiment. The considered picosecond regime of a driver
laser pulse is consistent with widely studied schemes for
generation of highly energetic proton and ion beams, which
makes the setup more easily adjustable, e.g. more easily syn-
chronized. The considered targets possess a relatively large
"useful" surface, where the particles may be focused, of about
0:5 mm diameter. It is found that the ﬁne reﬂection condi-
tions on the internal target surface result in the formation of
a "coaxial" magnetized structure in the target volume, which
is ﬁlled with a hot magnetized plasma and evolve after for-
mation on a hydrodynamical time scale of about a hundred
of picoseconds. The coaxial structure appears as suitable for
energetic particle guiding as the homogeneous one, providing
similar collimation efﬁciency. The proposed setup may ap-
pear a perspective proton and ion post-generation guiding line,
providing good collimation efﬁciency for multi-MeV protons
and multi-hundreds-MeV electrons with modern and under-
construction picosecond petawatt laser facilities.

Appendix A
A thin magnetic lens with geometry of a perfect coil with
radius Rhas a focal length of fB=64mK=3pq2RB2for non
relativistic projectiles of kinetic energy K, mass mand charge
q, where Bdenotes the ﬁeld strength in the centre of the coil
[42]. Here, particles are supposed to propagate close to the
coil axis and deﬂection angles are presumed to be small. A
quasi-neural particle beam composed of ions and slow co-
propagating electrons will experience a stripping of negative
charge due to the strong effect of the Lorentz force on elec-
trons. Stripping electrons ahead of the coil may affect focus-ing of the magnetic lens, even though such space charge ef-
fects are relatively low [43] in typical laser accelerated beams
issued via TNSA. Where stripping of electrons does not de-
grade magnetic lensing, it enables for electric lensing in the
conﬁguration of a positively charged ring. For a beam propa-
gating along the coil symmetry axis zwith charge q(z)that is
accelerated by the radial component of the electric ﬁeld Er(z),
the integral of the Lorentz forceR+¥
 ¥qErdzvanishes. Strip-
ping results in an asymmetric q(z)that allows for a net de-
ﬂection towards the axis arµdrwith dr=R1. The later
proportionality is a necessary condition for the formation of
a focal spot. For further simpliﬁcation and estimates, one
assumes now that the stripping occurs instantaneously at the
position prior to the coil plane where the radial electric ﬁeld
swings from positive to negative values. Then the focal length
of the electric lens is fU=200KR=7qU, where Udenotes the
uniform potential of the coil. In the limit of thin lenses, the fo-
cal length of a combined electric and magnetic lens calculates
