ABSTRACT
The studies of FUors, EXors and other young eruptive stars ar e very important for the understanding of the earliest
stages of pre-main-sequence evolution. We describe the cur rent situation in this ﬁeld. This is the short version of
the review, presented in “Non-stationary processes in the p rotoplanetary disks and their observational manifestatio ns”
conference, Crimean Astrophysical Observatory.
Key words: young variable stars–eruptive activity–FUors–EXors
1 Introduction
Eruptive young stellar objects (YSO) make up a negligible
fraction of known YSOs. But it is their study that can be very
important for understanding the early stages of the evoluti on
of low- and medium-mass stars. And we still do not know
whether the phenomenon of eruption is a short-term, but
ordinaryevent on this evolutionarystage, or whether it occ urs
only under special circumstances.
Eruptive YSO classes:
–FUors
–FU Ori – like
–EXors
–Intermediate objects
Next, we brieﬂy discuss the properties of these objects.
2 FUors and FU Ori -like objects
Four so-called classic FUors : FU Ori, V1057 Cyg, V1515
Cyg, V1735 Cyg
The outburst of FU Ori was discovered about 90 years
ago; other three objects were found in the 70s. On the base
of these discoveries a new distinct class of young eruptive
stars was introduced ( Herbig ,1966;Ambartsumian ,1971).
The general features of FU Ori-like objects or simply FUors
(the name suggested by Ambartsumian) were deﬁned in the
work of Herbig (1977).
General properties of FUors in the optical
and IR ranges (Herbig ,1977;Audard et al. ,2014;
Connelley, Reipurth ,2018):
1. Optical ﬂare ( 5-6 mag.) with very slow decline (or none
at all)
2. In optics, the spectrum of an F-G supergiant, without
emissions, except for the P Cyg - type proﬁles in H /u1D6FCand
some other strong lines
3. Gradual change in spectral type with wavelength4. Deep CO absorption bands at 2.29 /u1D707m
5. The bolometric luminosity after a ﬂare is usually about
100-300L ⊙
6. They illuminate small reﬂection nebulae.
7. In most cases, they are sources of collimated ﬂows.
Outdated terms that can take on a new meaning :
Pre-fuors (i.e. progenitors of FUors). The very active
YSO V1331 Cyg was one time suggested as an example of
the future FUor. However, presently we know two classical
T Tau type stars (CTTS), which became FUors: V1057 Cyg
and V2493 Cyg.
Post-fuors . Currently nothing is known about them.
Could they be EXors?
Sub-fuors . While there is no good deﬁnition of this term
(they must be objects that are in some sense less active than
FUors), we can only guess which stars they should be - per-
haps EXors or MNors?
List of FUors
During last 40 years the number of known FUors was
growing very slowly. Certain objects were excluded from
that class after further observations. The currently accep ted
approach introduces two sub-classes: FUors (i.e. the objec ts
with observed outburst) and FUor-like objects (i.e. stars
with the spectra and other features typical for FUors af-
ter eruption). Current (2021-22) list, based on the atlas of
Connelley, Reipurth (2018) with several additions, is pre-
sented below.

mentioned, which perhaps can be considered as “superfuor”.
3 EXors
The class of EXors (by the name of prototype star EX Lupi)
was introduced by Herbig (1989), who deﬁned them as T
Tauri type stars with ﬂashes of large amplitude (up to 5
mag), but short in time and repetitive. Perhaps they are the
next stage of evolution after the FUors. As was emphasized by
Herbig (1989), it is impossible to distinguish them spectrally
from other CTTS.
Theclassical EXors , according to Herbig (1989),Herbig
(2008):
UZ Tau E, VY Tau, EX Lup, NY Ori, V1118 Ori
(Chanal’s star), V1143 Ori (Sugano’s star). Also PV Cep
and DR Tau were considered but rejected.
Probably important features of classical EXors
1. Flare amplitudes are comparable to FUors, but they have
a much shorter duration - from several months to several
years.
2. Bolometric luminosities during an outburst are usually
on the order of 5-30 L ⊙
3. EXors are not associated with small cometary nebulae
4. EXors are not related to jets and outﬂows
Supposed EXors
There is no deﬁnitive list, because the boundaries of
the class itself are vague. “The original list of EXors has
changed little since 1989” - ( Audard et al. ,2014). “New EX-
ors” ( Lorenzetti et al. ,2012) was an attempt to identify erup-
tive objects similar to classical EXors in the total mass of
CTTS. As a result of these and other works, the following
objects were considered as EXors: V512 Per (SVS 13), V1180
Cas, XZ Tau (N), LDN1415 IRS, V1647 Ori, GM Cha, OO
Ser, V2492 Cyg, GM Cep and again PV Cep, and V723 Car
(turned out to be a massive object).
Most of the candidates for EXors subsequently disap-
peared from this list according to various criteria (in term s
of luminosity, mass, character of variability, etc.); a num berof them passed into the class of intermediate objects. Be-
sides, almost all "new EXors" turned out to be associated
with optical outﬂows and cometary nebulae.
An analysis of the evolutionary position of EXors
(Moody & Stahler ,2017) leads to the conclusion that almost
all “new EXors” are deeply embedded in dust objects, clas-
sical EXors are somewhat older, and that only a small part
of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars are subject to EXor-type
outbursts. In recent years, a detailed study of EXors - “EX-
ORCISM” program has been launched. In the course of this
program ( Giannini et al. ,2022), in addition to 6 classical
EXors, as well as PV Cep and DR Tau stars, the following
objects were subjected to detailed studies: XZ Tau N, V350
Cep, ASASSN-13db (very low luminosity object), V1647
Ori, iPTF15afq. Some of them undoubtedly also are the in-
termediate objects. Also among the most recent ﬁnds of the
probable EXor-type objects Gaia 20eae, ESO-H /u1D6FC99 should
be mentioned.
4 Intermediate objects
This class of eruptive PMS objects cannot yet be precisely
deﬁned, but it certainly exists and has a number of common
properties (at least in the visible range), combining FUors
and EXors characteristics in various proportions.
1. Like FUors, they are usually associated with collimated
outﬂows and small nebulae.
2. Outbursts last several years (between FUors and EXors)
3. Often have emission spectra of classic TTS.
4. Bolometric luminosities are moderate.
The ﬁrst recognized intermediate object is V1647 Ori
(McNeil’s Object), found in 2004 ( McNeil et al. ,2004).
The name MNors (coined from “McNeil’s star” and ap-
parently premature as no deﬁnitions exist yet) was proposed
byContreras Peña at al. (2017) when searching for eruptive
IR variables, deeply immersed in dark clouds. It is possi-
ble that some of 15 objects, discovered by this group, with
ﬂare duration of 1–4 years, are indeed related to FUors and
EXors. One also can add to this list infrared variable object
UKIDSS-J185318.36+012454.5, recently found in BAO.
For obvious reasons it is diﬃcult to compile a complete
current list of such objects, but it will include at least 20
objects. A number of objects were identiﬁed on the base of
actually observed outbursts, a few more - as the probable
FUor-like stars (with a spectrum similar to the post-outbur st
stage, which, however, changed a few years later) – see, in
particular, Connelley, Reipurth (2018).
Intermediate objects of the ﬁrst group (with unusual
lightcurve) :
–V1647 Ori (McNeil’s Object)
–V346 Nor (HH57 IRS)
–OO Ser
–V1180 Cas
–PV Cep
–V350 Cep
–V2492 Cyg
–V899 Mon
–IRAS 20390+4642 (Gaia19bey)
–2MASS 22352345 + 7517076Young eruptive stars 3
–2MASS 08104579 - 3604310 (Gaia19ajj)
–HOPS 383 – an object of Class 0, visible only in IR range
–V1318 Cyg S – can it be a very slow FUor?
Intermediate objects of the second group (distin-
guished by optical and IR spectra) :
–IRAS 06297+1021W
–AR 6a (V912 Mon)
–AR 6b
–IRAS 18270-0153W
–IRAS 06393+0913 (can be a brown dwarf)
–IRAS 18341-0113S (can be a brown dwarf)
5 New examples of unusual eruptive PMS stars
5.1 V1318 Cyg S (LkH /u1D736225): very slow FUor?
This emission-line star was dicovered by Herbig (1960). Be-
fore 1991 it demonstrated strong TTS type variability with
occasional ﬂares-up.
Magakian et al. (2019) found an atypical brightness in-
crease (>5 mag) in 2015.
The object developed to HAeBe star with 750 L ⊙in the
optical range after the outburst. Its spectrum shows strong P
Cyg -type absorptions, but also typical CTTS emissions.
The blue spectrum is very reminiscent of classic FUors,
in red and IR ranges it is closer to Gaia 19ajj, V2492 Cyg,
and V1647 Ori. Mass of the star can be as high as 8 M ⊙
(Magakian et al. ,2019;Hillenbrand et al. ,2022).
5.2 PV Cep: super-EXor?
This variable star and the connected variable nebula were di s-
covered at BAO in 1977 ( Gyulbudaghian, Magakian ,1977).
Shows powerful (up to 5 mag) ﬂashes lasting for several
years, the last peak in 2017. Presently is at minimum.
Has emission-rich CTTS-type spectrum. Forbidden
emissions split to 4 variable components. Spectral type is
estimated as G4. Bolometric luminosity reaches 100 L ⊙at
maximum, and is about 20 L ⊙at the minimum. The accretion
rate is about 10−6M⊙y−1, which is quite high value.
In addition to high luminosity and amplitude of ﬂares,
PV Cep is a source of a powerful and extended optical and
molecular outﬂows ( Andreasyan et al. ,2021;Giannini et al. ,
2022).
5.3 V350 Cep: mini-FUor?
V350 Cep is located in NGC 7129 star forming region. It
was discovered in 1977 in BAO ( Gyulbudaghian, Sarkisyan ,
1977). After the rise on 4.5 magnitudes in the beginning of
70s, star remains on the same level; thus, its light curve is
almost FUor-type. Two or three times the UXor-like fadings
up to 2 mag were observed, then the brightness was restored.
(Semkov et al. ,2017)
V350 Cep has a rich emission spectrum of the classical
TTS, which does not change, spectral type is M0-M2. Can
be a source of HH ﬂow. Its bolometric luminosity after the
outburst is quite low: 3.3 L ⊙.5.4 V565 Mon
This little-studied variable star illuminates triangle re ﬂection
nebula Pars 17 and produces HH outﬂow. It is also extremely
bright mid-IR source. The bolometric luminosity of V565
Mon is high: 130 L ⊙. However, it cannot be considered as a
typical HAeBe star, since its spectral type is probably near
G0. The only emission line (excluding the forbidden lines,
probably belonging to jet) is double-peaked H /u1D6FC. On the other
hand, the most unusual is the presence of strong BaII absorp-
tion lines in its spectrum. Their existence suggests either
the low-gravity atmosphere (typical for FUors), either the
inexplicable overabundance of barium in a very young star.
All these features, summarized in the work of Andreasyan
(2021), do not allow the easy classiﬁcation of this object.
6 Conclusion
If eruptions of YSO are indeed due to abrupt changes in
the temp of accretion, their observed manifestations are ve ry
diﬀerent. We see several classes of them.
FUors: more or less well deﬁned. Apparently very rare
or short term.
EXors: the ﬁnal number of discovered objects is un-
clear;there is also no exact deﬁnition. Perhaps indeed ther e
are two groups of similar objects on slightly diﬀerent evolu -
tionary stage.
Intermediate objects: their great variety is no doubt. Some
of them appear to push the limits of usually accepted deﬁni-
tions of FUors and EXors. Most interesting objects for furth er
research.
MNors: may not yet deserve a separate class.
HAeBe stars and other massive objects: could some of
them after eruptions develop into FUors?
In addition, all these manifestations can be mixed with
UXor-type activity.
Young eruptive objects also can be found among certain
Class I IR sources, which change brightness and become
noticeable in the optical range.
