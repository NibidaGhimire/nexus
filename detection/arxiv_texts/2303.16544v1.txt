Abstract —Reconﬁgurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a newly-
emerged technology that, with its unique features, is consi dered
to be a game changer for future wireless networks. Channel
estimation is one of the most critical challenges for the rea lization
of RIS-assisted communications. Non-parametric channel e stima-
tion techniques are inefﬁcient due to the huge pilot dimensi onality
that stems from the large number of RIS elements. The challen ge
becomes more serious if we consider the mobility of the users
where the channel needs to be re-estimated whenever the user
moves to a new location. This paper develops a novel maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE) for jointly estimating the line -of-sight
(LOS) channel from the user to the RIS and the direct channel
between the user and the base station. By smartly reﬁning the
RIS conﬁguration during the channel estimation procedure, we
show that the channels can be accurately estimated with only a
few pilot transmissions—much fewer than the number of RIS
elements. The proposed scheme is also shown to be capable of
effectively tracking the channel when the user moves around in a
continuous but non-stationary manner with varying LOS angl es.

I. I NTRODUCTION
A reconﬁgurable intelligent surface (RIS) can shape the
propagation environment between a wireless transmitter an d
receiver [1]–[3]. The prevalent use case is to deploy an RIS
within line-of-sight (LOS) from a base station (BS) and then
conﬁgure it to reﬂect the BS’s signals toward a user that has
LOS to the RIS but not to the BS [4]. This is because the RIS
cannot manage the highly frequency-selective fading in non -
LOS scenarios and hardly beats a direct LOS path. Channel
state information (CSI) is essential for RIS conﬁguration a nd
can be acquired through pilot signaling. Unfortunately, th e
pilot length required by the least-squares (LS) estimator [ 5]
and minimum mean-squared error estimator [6] is proportion al
to the number of RIS elements, which can be in the order of
hundreds. This massive pilot requirement makes it essentia l to
ﬁnd an answer to the question posed in [3]: “ Can an RIS be
real-time reconﬁgured to manage user mobility? ”
Dynamic RIS reconﬁguration under user mobility has been
considered in several recent works, with a focus on scenario s
with stationary fading processes. Jakes’ model was used in
[7], [8] to describe the temporal fading correlation over no n-
LOS channels with Rayleigh fading and known statistics.
This work was supported by the FFL18-0277 grant from SSF.LOS channels were treated in [9], [10] using Rician fading
models with similar temporal correlation and LOS paths that
are constant over time except for the phase shifts. These
approaches can track the channel aging for users moving in
a tiny region where the channel statistics can be modeled
as stationary but cannot manage large-scale mobility (e.g. ,
vehicles or people passing by an RIS). In LOS scenarios,
where the optimal RIS conﬁguration reﬂects the signal via
the LOS path [4], the RIS must only be reconﬁgured when
the user moves out of the main lobe of the reﬂected signal;
that is, when the channel statistics are changing so the prio r
methods are insufﬁcient.
Pilots must be transmitted more frequently under mobility,
thus it is problematic to use the approaches in [7]–[10] that
require a pilot length equal to the number of RIS elements
(plus one for the direct path). There are ways to utilize the
channel structure to reduce the pilot length. One approach
is to treat adjacent RIS elements as a single element [11],
at the cost of reduced beamforming gain. By limiting the
scope to a LOS scenario, one can exploit the resulting channe l
structure to estimate the complete channels using shorter
pilots, using compressive sensing or array signal processi ng
methods [12]. For example, parametric maximum likelihood
estimators (MLEs) were derived in [13], [14], but without
considering a direct path or user mobility.
In this paper, we consider the estimation and tracking of the
LOS channel between the UE and RIS, particularly consider-
ing large-scale mobility where there is no stationary chann el
statistics (contrary to previous works). We derive a new MLE
for joint estimation of the UE-RIS and direct channel, with
arbitrary RIS conﬁgurations during pilot transmission. We
propose a mechanism where the estimation accuracy is pro-
gressively reﬁned by updating the RIS conﬁgurations during
pilot transmission, thereby enabling much fewer pilots tha n in
[5]–[10]. Finally, we demonstrate how the mechanism can be
used for tracking the channel under user mobility.
II. S YSTEM MODEL
An RIS-assisted communication system is considered,
where the transmission between the single-antenna UEs and
the single-antenna BS is aided by an RIS with Nrecon-
ﬁgurable elements. The channel between the BS and the
RIS,h= [h1,...,hN]T∈CN, is assumed to be knownsince the RIS and BS are deployed at ﬁxed locations. The
channel between an arbitrary UE and the RIS is denoted by
g= [g1,...,gN]T∈CNand the direct channel between this
UE and the BS is represented by d∈C. The BS serves
a multitude of UEs at different locations in a time-division
multiple access (TDMA) manner. The channels ganddare
time-varying in a non-stationary manner and must thus be
estimated in the absence of a statistical characterization . We
consider the uplink but the results of this paper are also
applicable to the downlink.
If the UE transmits the signal x∈Cto the BS, the received
signal can be expressed as [4]
y=/parenleftBiggN/summationdisplay
n=1hngne−jθn+d/parenrightBigg
x+w, (1)
wherew∼ NC(0,σ2)is the complex Gaussian receiver noise
andθnis the phase shift that the nth RIS element applies to
the impinging signal. If xd∼ NC(0,Pd)is the transmitted
data signal with power Pd, the spectral efﬁciency (SE) for a
given RIS conﬁguration is [4]

where the expression on the ﬁrst line holds for the arbitrary
RIS phase shifts e−jθ1,...,e−jθNand the upper bound on
the second line is achieved by setting the RIS phase shifts as
θn= arg(hn)+arg(gn)−arg(d)forn= 1,...,N . With this
optimal selection, the signals from all the N+1propagation
paths are combined coherently at the BS. As his assumed to
be known, we need to estimate the direct channel dand the
channelgbetween the UE and RIS. To focus on the channel
estimation problem, we consider a hardware implementation
where any phase shifts θn∈[0,2π)can be selected.
In the next section, we will develop a novel MLE for
joint estimation of gandd, wheregis assumed to be LOS-

III. P ARAMETRIC MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR
In this section, we will derive the proposed MLE for the
problem at hand. By deﬁning the RIS phase-shift vector θ=/bracketleftbig
e−jθ1,...,e−jθN/bracketrightbigT∈CNand the diagonal matrix Dh=
diag(h1,...,hN), we can rewrite (1) as
y= (θTDhg+d)x+w. (8)
The cascaded UE-RIS-BS channel θTDhgcan be interpreted
as a projection of the unknown channel gonto the direction
of the vector θTDhdetermined by the RIS conﬁguration. The
UE transmits a known pilot signal at Ltime instances and
the RIS uses a different conﬁguration at each time instance s o
that the projections of gin different directions are observable.
Particularly, if the UE transmits the deterministic pilot s ignal

RIS being conﬁgured as θ1,...,θL, the concatenated received

where
B= [θ1,...,θL]T, (10)
w= [w1,...,wL]T, (11)
andwl∼ NC(0,σ2)is the independent noise at pilot time
instancel, forl= 1,...,L .
There is a multitude of channel estimators that can be
developed based on the received pilot signal in (9). We
will take the MLE approach [15] because the channels g
anddare assumed to be unknown but not having a known
random characterization due to non-stationary mobility. T he

We are looking for the channel estimates ˆgandˆdthat
maximize the PDF in (12), which is equivalent to minimizing
the squared norm in the exponent. Hence, we can formulate
the MLE problem as{ˆg,ˆd}= argmin

whereRe(·)gives the real part of its argument. Without loss
of generality, we decompose the direct channel into its chan nel
gainα≥0and phase shift ϑ∈[0,2π)asd=√αejϑ.
These channel parameters will only appear in the last two
terms of (13), thus the corresponding MLE subproblem can
be expressed as

MLE subproblems of the kind in (21) may have many local
maxima [16]. We might identify all of them [13] but in our
case, a simple grid search is sufﬁcient because we will devel op
an algorithm in Section IV that iteratively improves the uti lity
function in (21) by sending new pilots until the global peak
value is easily distinguished from the local ones. We thus so lve
(21) numerically by performing a two-dimensional search ov er
the set of feasible AoAs.
The following theorem summarizes the proposed channel
estimation scheme.

The estimates are interconnected in the sense that we must
ﬁrst compute ˆϕusing (22) and use it to compute the MLE of ˆg
from (23) and (24). Finally, ˆgis used to compute ˆdusing (25)
and (26). This is the opposite order of how they were derived.
We can now conﬁgure the RIS based on the estimates. Since
there is no channel statistics, the RIS should be conﬁgured a s
if the estimates are perfect. Particularly, the phase shift vector
¯θ=ej(ˆϑ−ˆω)diag/parenleftBig
e−jarg(h1),...,e−jarg(hN)/parenrightBig
a∗(ˆϕ),(27)
achieves the maximum SE in (3) if the parameters have been
perfectly estimated. We notice that it depends on the AoA ˆϕ
and phase shifts ˆω,ˆϑ, but not on the channel gains ˆα,ˆβsince
we only want to align all signal paths in phase.
IV. A DAPTIVE RIS C ONFIGURATION DURING ESTIMATION
The accuracy of the proposed MLE procedure in Theorem 1
depends on how the RIS is conﬁgured during channel esti-
mation; that is, the choice of B. Many previous works (e.g.,[5], [6], [13]) require L≥NsinceBis either selected a
priori to explore all channel dimensions of CNor randomly.
In this section, we propose an iterative algorithm to adapti vely
add columns to Bto improve the MLE accuracy. If we use
the subscript lto denote the estimated parameters in the lth
iteration, from (27), the SE-maximizing RIS phase shift vec tor
is given by
¯θl=ej(ˆϑl−ˆωl)diag/parenleftBig
e−jarg(h1),...,e−jarg(hN)/parenrightBig
a∗(ˆϕl).
(28)
This RIS phase shift vector is then used for selecting the nex t
RIS conﬁguration during the pilot transmission.
We deﬁne a set B={¯ϕ1,¯ϕ2,...,¯ϕN}ofN=NHNV
plausible azimuth-elevation AoA pairs for the user that mig ht
be considered during channel estimation. Based on these
angles, we deﬁne the resulting set of RIS conﬁgurations as
Θ =/braceleftBig
diag/parenleftBig
e−jarg(h1),...,e−jarg(hN)/parenrightBig
a∗(ϕ) :ϕ∈ B/bracerightBig
.
(29)
Our proposed method can be explained as follows: First, we
select two RIS conﬁgurations θ1andθ2from the set in (29)
and transmit pilots at two time instances utilizing the sele cted
RIS conﬁguration matrix B2= [θ1,θ2]T. We then use Theo-
rem 1 to estimate the AoA vector from (22) via a 2D search
over the set deﬁned in (5) and obtain the estimated phase
shifts from (23) and (25). For the (l+1)th pilot transmission,
the RIS conﬁguration is set as the unused conﬁguration in
Θwhich is closest to the RIS phase shift vector ¯θlin (28),
in terms of the absolute value of the inner product. The RIS
conﬁguration matrix is updated as Bl+1= [BT
l,θl+1]T, where
the subscripts indicate the iteration number. A new pilot is
then transmitted using the newly obtained conﬁguration and
the concatenated received signal yl+1= [yT
l,yl+1]Tis used
for channel estimation in the (l+1)th iteration. This procedure
is iteratively performed until we reach the intended number of
pilot transmissions L. Algorithm 1 summarizes the proposed
iterative scheme for estimating the channel parameters.
We show in Section V that the proposed algorithm quickly
converges to a good channel estimate using L≪N.
A. Channel Tracking
If the BS has a sense of where the UE is, the initial RIS
conﬁgurations θ1,θ2in the channel estimation can be selected
to explore that location. Hence, one important use case of
Algorithm 1 is to successively estimate the channel of a UE
that moves along an unknown trajectory. If θ1is selected based
on the last successful RIS conﬁguration, we begin searching
for a new RIS conﬁguration in its vicinity. This can lead to
efﬁcient tracking of the RIS channel using even fewer pilots .
We will detail such a procedure in the next section.
V. N UMERICAL RESULTS
We will now demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
parametric MLE and adaptive RIS conﬁguration. We consider
an indoor setup where the RIS is mounted in the middle of
a wall in a 5×5 m2room, to have a LOS link to a UE inAlgorithm 1 Parametric MLE of gandd.

the room and to the BS outside the building (e.g., through a
window). The RIS is equipped with NH=NV= 8 elements
where the element spacing is ∆H= ∆V=λ/4. Since the BS
is deployed outside the building, the direct path between UE
and BS is a non-LOS link. We assume that the direct path is
ten times stronger than the per-element cascaded channel an d
generated as d∼ NC(0,10|hngn|2). Since we consider LOS
channels to/from the RIS, |hngn|is independent of the element
indexn. We generate the azimuth and elevation angles in the
setBconsidered during channel estimation as [14]:
ϕaz= arcsin/parenleftbigg2m

.(31)
The user walks randomly in the room with an average speed
of50cm/ssuch that the azimuth and elevation angles seen
from the RIS change over time. An instance of the angle
variation is illustrated in Fig. 1 for 200seconds. When the UE
is close to the RIS, a relatively small move may translate to a
rapid variation in the azimuth and elevation angles. In Fig. 1,
this phenomenon occurred in the time interval indicated by a
rectangle. We utilize these angles to generate channel vect or
gas in (4). Since the LOS channel between the RIS and BS is
known, our algorithm compensates for Dhby designing the
RIS conﬁguration according to (29). Therefore, any choice o f
the angles used to generate hgives the same results.
We deﬁne the per-element data SNR as
SNRd=Pd
σ2|hngn|2, (32)
and assume the pilot SNR, SNRp, is10dB larger than SNRd
(i.e.,Pp= 10Pd) since pilots can be expanded over frequency.
Fig. 2 shows the average SE over different noise realization
and all AOAs during the random walk, with respect to the
pilot length LwhenSNRp= 0 dB andSNRd=−10dB.(a) Variations in the azimuth angle over time.
(b) Variations in the elevation angle over time.
Fig. 1: An example of how the azimuth and elevation change
over time when a UE walks randomly in the considered room.
In this ﬁgure, the black and magenta lines represent the SE
in (2) achieved using the proposed MLE scheme, where the
colors distinguish between different approaches of select ing
{θ1,θ2}in Step2of Algorithm 1. The dashed black line
corresponds to the random selection of θ1andθ2from the
setΘwhile the solid magenta line follows a smarter selection.
Speciﬁcally, when a user wishes to connect to the BS for the
ﬁrst time, Algorithm 1 selects {θ1,θ2}randomly which results
in the SE represented with the black line in Fig. 2. Hencefort h,
the CSI only needs to be updated periodically to avoid SE
losses. As the user speed is limited, we select θ1based on
our last successful RIS conﬁguration. Speciﬁcally, if ¯θLis the
RIS phase shift vector obtained in the last channel estimati on
phase, we select θ1as
θ1= argmax
θ∈Θ|¯θH
Lθ|, (33)
andθ2randomly. This approach results in the magenta line
in Fig. 2. We compare our method with the maximum SE
obtained with perfect CSI according to (3). Additionally, w e
use the conventional LS estimator [5] as the benchmark,
whereLcolumns of an N×NDFT matrix are used as the
LRIS conﬁgurations [14]. We observe that the black line
converges gradually to the maximum SE and reaches 98%Fig. 2: Average SE with respect to pilot length L. The
proposed method is compared with with LS and perfect CSI.
withL= 9pilot transmissions. When we exploit our last RIS
conﬁguration to initialize the channel estimation algorit hm at
the next time instance, 98% of the maximum SE is achieved
already with L= 5pilots. On the other hand, the LS estimator
needs60pilots to attain this level. We stress that our proposed
algorithm converges quickly since, at each iteration, it se nds
a new pilot using an unused RIS conﬁguration from Θthat
helps solidify estimation accuracy.
A. Channel Tracking
The optimized RIS conﬁguration in (27) beamforms the
impinging signal toward the UE and matches the phase shift
with that of the direct path. When the user moves randomly
in the room, the AOAs at the RIS and the phase difference
between the direct and cascaded path (ϑ−ω)will change.
The variations have therefore non-stationary statistics a nd are
related to the walking speed of the user and its current dista nce
from the RIS. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm to track the channel variations and inve s-
tigate how frequently the RIS conﬁguration must be changed
to maintain an acceptable SE. To this end, we generate channe l
realizations every 200ms and between two time instances, the
UE moves 10cm. To re-estimate the channel and re-conﬁgure
the RIS, we use Algorithm 1 with L= 6and follow the smart
initialization given in (33) that resulted in the magenta li ne
in Fig. 2. Accordingly, Fig. 3 reports the SE (averaged over
different noise realizations) at each time instance, based on
two RIS re-conﬁguration policies. The ﬁrst policy estimate s
the channel and selects the RIS conﬁguration every 1second,
while the second policy updates the conﬁguration every 10
seconds. For both policies, the RIS conﬁguration is constan t
between two updates. We observe that with the ﬁrst policy, we
can track the channel variations and maintain an SE close to
the perfect CSI case almost all the time; the solid yellow lin e
rarely falls below 8bps/Hz, which is 92% of the maximum
SE in this setup. On the other hand, updating the CSI every 10
seconds is not frequent enough to efﬁciently track the chann el,
leading to many deep falls in SE (see the blue dashed curve)Fig. 3: Achievable SE following two different policies to re conﬁgure the RIS. The channel instances are generated every 200ms
and the UE moves 10cm between each two instances. L= 6 pilots are used to update the CSI and re-conﬁgure the RIS.
since the UE moves out of the main lobe of the beam from the
RIS. The intuition is that as long as the RIS is reconﬁgured
frequently enough so that the UE never moves out of the main
lobe, we have an insigniﬁcant performance loss in between th e
RIS updates which is mainly due to the fast-changing phase
shift difference between the direct and RIS paths.
VI. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed a new MLE-based channel
estimation framework with low training overhead, high ac-
curacy, and mobility management capability. By adaptively
conﬁguring the RIS during the channel estimation process,
the proposed method progressively improves the channel est i-
mation accuracy and obtains accurate CSI using much fewer
pilots than there are RIS elements. We showed that the number
of pilot transmissions can be further reduced if we have some
prior knowledge of the location of the user. This feature can
be used to efﬁciently track the channel of a user that moves
along an unknown trajectory with very low pilot overhead.
