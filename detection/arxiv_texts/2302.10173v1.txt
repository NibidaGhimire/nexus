Abstract. In the article the possibility of creating a time machine,
based on the mechanism of quantum entanglement of macroscop ic ordinary
(many)partial conﬁgurations and (many)partially ghostly conﬁgurations of
diﬀerent historical epochs belonging to diﬀerent parallel Everett universes is
investigated.
Keywords: Time machine, ghost particles, entanglement historical ep ochs,
parallel universes.
Introduction
Deutsch in /guillemotleft.cyrThe Fabric of Reality/guillemotright.cyr [1] universe, that is para llel to our universe
in the sense of the Everett’s interpretations of quantum mec hanics, called shadow .
Elena Palesheva in the article [2] linked shadow particles o f parallel universe
withghost particles of our Universe. She also conﬁrmed the Deutsch’s point that
shady particles, i.e. ghost particles can weakly interact w ith ordinary particles of
our universe through quantum interference.
In the [3–5] articles we suggested linking space-time traje ctories appearing in
Wheeler-DeWitt geometrodynamics with real-life parallel historical epochs, which
are various time periods of human civilization. Transition from one epoch to another
carried out by launching a special apparatus, called a time m achine, was realized
as the mechanism of quantum entanglement of compact spatio- temporal regions
of diﬀerent historical epochs. However, in this article we d id not say how this
entanglement occurs.
In given article we proposes to consider as such mechanism th e entangling of
macroscopic usual (many) partial conﬁgurations and (many) partial-ghost conﬁgu-
rations. The latest are the conﬁgurations from the parallel universe due to the idea
of Elena Palesheva.
1. Ghost particles
A ghost particle is a particle whose moment-momentum tensor is zero, but its
current is non-zero, which in in the case of a bispinor is
ji=ψ+γiψ.Mathematical Structures and Modeling. 2020. N.3(55) 13
Therefore, such a particle carries neither energy nor momen tum.
Such non-Abelian solutions of the Yang–Mills equations wer e found by Loos
in 1967 [6]. Recall that the quanta of the Yang–Mills ﬁelds ar e vector particles
(i.e. bosons with spin 1) and have zero mass. However, throug h the mechanism
of spontaneous symmetry breaking physical Yang–Mills ﬁeld s can acquire non-zero
mass. Under considering the weak interaction the quantum of Yang–Mills ﬁelds is
considered a W-particle having a charge of +1, 0 or -1. For the strong interaction,
the quantum of the Yang–Mills ﬁeld is gluons hold protons and neutrons together.
In the case of particles propagating in outer space, ghost pa rticles were discovered
in 1974 by Griﬃth [7], and then the corresponding solutions o f the Einstein–Dirac
equations were found and published in works [8,9,11–20,22, 23] 1970-80s of the XX
century, and already in the XXI century /emdash.cyr [24–30]. Neutrino g hosts and massive
bisprinor ghosts were found in the universes Robinson-Walk er, i.e. in Friedmann’s
universes [30]. "What the most interesting thing about ghos t solutions is how the
neutrino ﬁeld propagates in the background space-time with out changing him, which
means we can’t detect ghost neutrinos by their gravitationa l eﬀects" [25].
"The ﬁrst reaction, writes M. Novello in the article "The gho stly foundations for
neutrinos" (1974), /emdash.cyr these solutions may be rejected on phys ical grounds. However,
the fact that they seem to be present in any geometry1, makes their less superﬁcial
study expedient. To be able to study some of the details of the se ghosts, we must
ﬁnd not only one, but also a class of these solutions in the giv en geometry". And
he discovers a surprising result: he gives an example space- time generated by a
neutrino, and this itself neutrino is a linear combination o f neutrino-ghosts [12].
However, before the work of Elena Palesheva no one gave at lea st some interpre-
tations to ghost particles.
Combining the results of Palesheva and Novello, we can state the following hy-
pothesis.
The universe, in which we are aware of our presence, consists of real particles,
i.e. particles with a non-zero tensor energy-momentum. Gho st particles are guests
from parallel universes. But there are inﬁnitely many paral lel universes; all of them
are symmetrical with respect to our analysis (there is no ded icated "our" Universe),
therefore, one can only exist ghost particles. Energy and mo mentum are imparted to
a particle from the speciﬁc one under consideration, i.e., ﬁ xed by someone conscious-
ness, the universe, if, from the point of view of mathematics , it is linear combination
of ghost particles. But to decompose a particle into linear c ombination requires some
mechanism present in universe, which brings about and conﬁr ms the fact of decay.
Obviously, this is the same mechanism that ﬁxed a particular universe. And this
mechanism is consciousness, there is an observer, present, living in this universe.
Consciousness, by its attention to the universe surroundin g it, performs an act
creation, expressed in the generation of linear combinatio ns ghost particles: from
chaos of ghost particles to order="linear combinations", f rom simple to complex.
1It is stated in [13] that ghost neutrinos (described by the ge neral covariant Weyl equation
ϕA
||A˙X= 0) exist only in algebraic special space-times with a neutrin o ﬂux vector parallel to one of
the main zero vectors of the conformal tensor.14 А.К. Гуц. Частицы-призраки, сцепленность исторических эп ох...
It is important that Palesheva showed that ghost particles, i.e. particles parallel
universe, interact with our particles and this interaction manifests itself in the form
of quantum interference.
However, another interaction of the particles of our Univer se is possible and
parallel. This is quantum entanglement (entanglement). Le t’s describe it the non-
forceinteraction of particles from diﬀerent universes.
2. Examples of ghost particles
Consider spinor particles described by the equation Dirac:
i/planckover2pi1γ(k)∂ψ
∂xk−mcψ= 0. (1)
Then bispinor
ψ(x) =
1
1
−1
1
emc
/planckover2pi1x2+f(x0+x3)+ig(x0+x3)(2)
is a solution to the Dirac equation. Here g(x0+x3)andf(x0+x3)/emdash.cyr smooth real
functions.
Based on the results of Theorem 12.1 from [31,32], we obtain t hat (2) describes
a spinor ghost only if g(x0+x3) =const∈R.
Let’s take the solution for a real wave in the form:
ψ(x) =
1
1

1
emc
/planckover2pi1x2+i(x0+x3), (3)
and for the spinor ghost we set
φ(y) =
1

emc
/planckover2pi1y2. (4)
3. Particle entanglement and ghost particles
Let|ψ(±)/angbracketrightrand|φ(±)/angbracketrightgbe the states of a real particle and a ghost corresponding
to bispinor solutions ψ(x,±)andφ(x,±))of Dirac equations with diﬀerent spin
projections ±[33].
The entangled state of two particles in this case is describe d by ket-vector
|ψ(+)/angbracketrightr⊗|φ(−)/angbracketrightg+|ψ(−)/angbracketrightr⊗|φ(+)/angbracketrightg.
According to the ER=EPR statement about the existence of an Einstein-Rosen
bridge, or a 3-dimensional wormhole, connecting the locati ons of entangled particlesMathematical Structures and Modeling. 2020. N.3(55) 15
(EPR-pairs) [34], we can say that there is a 3-dimensional wo rmhole connecting a
particle of our universe with a shadow particle, or ghost par ticle, from a parallel
universe.
4. How to entangle the particles?
"How to entangle the particles: take a crystal with non-line ar optical proper-
ties /emdash.cyr that is, such, the interaction of light with which depe nds on the intensity of
this light. For example, triborate lithium, barium beta-bo rate, potassium niobate.
Irradiate it with a laser appropriate wavelength /emdash.cyr and high- energy laser photons
radiation will sometimes decay into pairs of entangled phot ons less energy (this
phenomenon is called "spontaneous parametric scattering" ) and polarized in per-
pendicular planes. It remains to keep the entangled particl es intact and spread as
far apart as possible" [35].
As you can see, the entanglement mechanisms are already in pl ace. Although
not yet those we need.
5. Macroscopic entanglement
To achieve our goal, we need a macroscopic multiparticle ent anglement. Does
it exist? Common the opinion that macroscopic entanglement does not occur in
nature outside artiﬁcially created situations. What is thi s opinion based on?
It is known that as the size of physical systems increases it g etsharder com-
pletely isolate them from the environment , and interaction with the environment
/emdash.cyr decoherence /emdash.cyr destroys quantum characteristics such as su perpositions and en-
tanglement, i.e., in particular, the entanglement many-pa rticle conﬁgurations from
parallel epochs.
The beauty of a quantum description of an object is that such a n object is a
quantum object represented by a coherent superposition wav es, which has both an
interference pattern and, possibly, entanglement. But eve n if there is macroentangle-
ment, it is diﬃcult to discover on a macroscopic scale, since quantum objects interact
with a large number of degrees of freedom, and any inaccuracy in the original data
or follow-up (coarse-grained) leads to decoherence, loss o f consistency between the
waves describing all these degrees of freedom, and to the dis appearance of their
interference pattern, to the loss of entanglement. Consequ ently, the essence of the
quantum descriptions, giving fantastic from the point of vi ew of the classical physics
possibilities is lost.
For our goal – the transfer of a macro-object, a person to anot her epoch /emdash.cyr it
is necessary to make sure that the laws of quantum mechanics a re also valid for
macroobjects. To do this, you need to pay attention to those o f their mechanical
degrees of freedom of the macro object, which are well isolat ed from the environ-
ment and therefore well protected from decoherence. We need macroscopic quantum
mechanics.
The appearance of such a "mechanics" became possible thanks to the recent
progress in quantum optomechanics: physicists were able to use light (sometimes16 А.К. Гуц. Частицы-призраки, сцепленность исторических эп ох...
microwaves) to transform macroscopic mechanical objects i nto almost pure quantum
states <..>. Soon they will be able to allow these mechanical objects to evolve
without much decoherence and measure the ﬁnal states, there by making comparisons
with the predictions of quantum mechanics" [36].
Note that we are using the terms "macroscopic" on a purely int uitive level, and
it’s not very correctly with a scientiﬁc approach to the prob lem under study.
It is important to decide in advance with what is considered a macroscopic ob-
ject: "although quantum systems are diﬃcult to maintain and observe in macroscale,
they can be easily created. On the other hand, the question na turally arises: is the
received macroscopic state? Based on experimental results , we have shown that an
entangled state that can be be obtained with the help of curre ntly available tech-
nologies, will include a suﬃciently large number of photons , which can be seen with
the naked eye" [37]. This makes our approach is satisfactory if macroscopicity is
concept related to size. We also mentioned that the componen ts entangled state can
be easily distinguished by a simple avalanche photodiode, i f you look at the disper-
sion of the distribution of the number photons. This pleases those who believe that
macro-entangled states should have components that can be e asily distinguished.
Although our study showed that the resulting state was surpr isingly resilient to
losses, we showed that it also becomes more and more brittle u nder phase perturba-
tion at increasing its size. So our approach is also satisfac tory if macroscopic agents
are sensitive to decoherence, and highlights the complexit y of possible interactions
between a given quantum system and its environment. We also s aw that the ac-
curacy of measurement needed to detect the quantum nature of the created state,
increases with its size. This also makes our scheme satisfac tory if macroscopicity
associated with the requirement for measurement accuracy. In conclusion, we note
that there are many other candidates for a measure of macrosc opicity [38]. Testing
each one is "working for the future" [39].
6. Entanglement and wormholes
Suppose that in the near future we will learn how to create mac roscopic entangled
multiparticle conﬁgurations. But for our goals related to t he time machine, this is
not enough, it is necessary chain conﬁgurations with ghost c onﬁgurations.
What should we expect if we manage to do this?
The quantum phenomenon of entanglement is closely related t o the classical the
phenomenon of the formation of a 3-dimensional wormhole. Co nsequently, entangle-
ment in space will give rise to a 3-dimensional wormhole or 4- dimensional wormhole
between parallel universes, between various historical ep oches. Transitions throut
such a wormhole are the quantum time machine [3,4].
However, since 3-dimensional wormholes are unstable, it fo llows think about
generating 4-dimensional wormholes [43]. Last thing, most likely indicates entan-
glement in time [44] (Time Entanglement), i.e. the formula EPR=ER is replaced
by the formula EPR=TE .Mathematical Structures and Modeling. 2020. N.3(55) 17
