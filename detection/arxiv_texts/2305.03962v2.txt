Proteins often regulate their activities via allostery - or action at a distance - in which the binding
of a ligand at one binding site influences the affinity for another ligand at a distal site. Although
less studied than in proteins, allosteric effects have been observed in experiments with DNA as well.
In these experiments two or more proteins bind at distinct DNA sites and interact indirectly with
each other, via a mechanism mediated by the linker DNA molecule. We develop a mechanical model
of DNA/protein interactions which predicts three distinct mechanisms of allostery. Two of these
involve an enthalpy-mediated allostery, while a third mechanism is entropy driven. We analyze
experiments of DNA allostery and highlight the distinctive signatures allowing one to identify which
of the proposed mechanisms best fits the data.
The term “allostery” indicates an action at a distance
in biological macromolecules where the binding of a lig-
and at one site modifies the binding of another ligand
at a distinct site. Many proteins regulate their activi-
ties via allostery [1], through mechanisms that are not
fully understood and presently debated, see e.g. [2]. Al-
though hitherto most of the focus has been on proteins,
allosteric effects have been observed in DNA as well [3, 4]
and discussed in models and simulations [5–7]. In DNA
allostery two or more proteins binding at distinct sites
interact with each other through some signal carried by
the linker DNA, see Fig. 1(a). Experiments show that the
interaction is weakly dependent on the DNA sequence
[3, 4], suggesting that allostery may be described by a
homogenous DNA model. The interaction is strongly
attenuated if one of the two strands is cut (DNA nick-
ing), which shows that allostery requires an intact DNA
molecule. This and other experimental evidences [3, 4]
show that the interaction is transmitted through DNA,
and not via direct (electrostatic) or solvent-mediated ef-
fects. A model of force-induced allostery was discussed
in [8]. However, this mechanism does not apply to ex-
periments in which DNA is not under tension [3, 4].
In all generality, the total free energy for the system
consisting of DNA and two bound proteins, separated by
a linker sequence of mbase pairs, is
Fab=F0+ ∆Fa+ ∆Fb+ ∆∆ Fint(m) (1)
where F0is the bulk contribution from DNA in absence
of bound proteins, ∆ Faand ∆ Fbare the excess free en-
ergies when only one of the two proteins, either “a” or
“b”, is bound. The interaction term, ∆∆ Fint(m), is the
excess free energy when both proteins are bound which
vanishes as m→ ∞ . If ∆∆ Fint<0 the simultaneous
binding of the two proteins leads to a net decrease of the
total free energy (cooperative binding). If ∆∆ Fint>0,
the simultaneous binding is destabilized. We introduce
a model which predicts three distinct mechanisms of al-
lostery, corresponding to different forms of ∆∆ Fint. We
introduce collective variables Xnat each base pair po-
sition 0 ≤n < N , which are local reaction coordinates
FIG. 1. (a) DNA-mediated interaction for two bound proteins
separated by a linker molecule of mbase pairs. (b) Model of
DNA allostery. The DNA substrate (yellow) is described as
a set of variables Xn≡un+¯ldefined at each base-pair site,
with⟨Xn⟩=¯lthe equilibrium value. These variables are char-
acterized by a local stiffness ( K0) and distal couplings ( K1,
K2, . . . ), with energy given by (2). Upon binding, the pro-
tein, (orange blob) modifies the local mechanical properties
of the DNA substrate. The distal couplings carry the signal
to distinct sites. The schematic plot in (b) shows a protein
interacting with a single DNA site. The more realistic case of
proteins binding to several DNA sites is also considered.
associated to DNA-protein binding. We define ¯l≡ ⟨Xn⟩,
the equilibrium value, and un≡Xn−¯l. At base pair
level, DNA deformations are described by several coarse-
grained coordinates like the 12 canonical ones (twist, roll,
tilt, rise, . . . ) of the rigid base model [9]. In our model un
could be one of these coordinates, a combination thereof,
or any other local deformation parameter. Experimental
data, discussed further, put constraints on the properties

collective nature of unand are indeed observed in sim-
ulations [10–14]. They typically extend to a few flank-
ing nucleotides (truncated at a distance Lin (2)) and
the strength and decay of the interactions depend on
the coarse-grained variable considered [13]. Distal cou-
plings are essential to generate allostery. The model (2)
is coarse-grained with one degree of freedom per DNA
site and it can be solved analytically. Using periodic
boundary conditions ( uN≡u0) we write (2) as
H0=1

where we introduced the discrete Fourier transforms

with qan integer, K−p=Kpand−N/2< q < N/ 2
[15]. In absence of distal couplings ( Kp= 0 for p≥1)
theq-stiffness eKq=K0is constant, thus a q-dependence
ofeKqreflects the existence of couplings between distal
sites. Note that the couplings Kpcan take any value as
long as eKq>0 for real q(stability condition).
We consider first proteins interacting with a single
DNA site. An unbound protein is thus described by a
single collective variable S, with average ⟨S⟩= ¯sand
energy Hp=ε(S−¯s)2. The binding to DNA (at site
n= 0) forces the corresponding collective variables to
assume the same value S=X0=¯l+u0so that the total
energy of DNA and protein ( H0+Hp) takes the form
H=H0+ε

0+ 2(¯l−¯s)u0+ (¯l−¯s)2
, (5)
omitting a constant binding energy which does not influ-
ence ∆∆ Fint. Equation (5) shows that protein binding
introduces perturbation “fields” proportional to u0and
u2
0. If the equilibrium value of the collective coordinates
of DNA and protein coincide (¯ s=¯l), the linear term
vanishes and only the term proportional to u2
0“survives”
in (5). Conversely, if |¯l−¯s|is large one can neglect the
quadratic term contribution [16]. In the following we
compute ∆∆ Fintfor three different cases where the pro-
teins induces a linear or a quadratic field.

Transforming the sum in (6) into an integral ( N→ ∞
limit), one obtains the asymptotic behavior of Smfromthe leading pole, i.e. the solution of eKq= 0 with the
smallest imaginary part. This equation cannot have so-
lutions for real qas stability requires eKq>0. In the
most general case the leading pole has real and imagi-
nary parts. Since eKqis real for real qand symmetric in

Enthalpic allostery – We consider first
HE=H0−h(u0+um) (10)
with h=−2ε(¯l−¯s), following (5). We find [17]
∆∆FE
int=−h2Sm (11)
which, being temperature independent, describes an in-
teraction of enthalpic origin [30]. The fields in 0 and
mshift the equilibrium values of u0andumand the
distal couplings K1,K2, . . . propagate this perturbation
to flanking sites, leading to ⟨un⟩ ̸= 0. Asymptotically
the interaction decays via damped oscillations, see (9).
We refer to ξEin (9) as the enthalpic allosteric length.
The interaction stabilizes or destabilizes the simultane-
ous protein binding depending on their distance m, see
Fig. 2(a). The calculation can be generalized to protein-
DNA couplings involving more than one site, i.e. of the
typePna−1

are the number of sites to which first (second) protein
binds and mis the number of base pairs separating the
nearest edges of the two proteins. The asymptotic decay
remains of the form (9) which is universal [17].

The interaction is of entropic origin ∆∆ FS
int =
−T∆∆S≤0, implying a net increase in entropy when
both proteins are bound (cooperative binding). This can
be understood as follows. The local stiffening to K0+ 2ε
at sites 0 and minduces an entropy reduction in two re-
gions surrounding the two perturbed sites. When mis
sufficiently small, the two regions overlap which leads to
a net entropy gain, hence ∆∆ S >0. This is reminiscent3

the DNA double helix and ξE= 15 bp were used. These pa-
rameters match those observed in experiments (see Fig. (3)).
In the case (a) the interaction is stabilizing/destabilizing de-

which is positive and thus a destabilizing interaction
term. It is temperature independent and thus of en-
thalpic nature. The term −hu0produces a ⟨un⟩ ̸= 0,
which contributes to the enthalpic part, but we find no
entropy change in this model. As ∆∆ FM
intdepends on S2
m
the asymptotic is very similar to the entropic case, with
decay length ξM=1
2ξEand oscillations proportional to
cos2(mϕ+ϕ0). As in the entropic case, interactions to
more than one site lead to a decay of the type (14), with
f(m)≥0. We note that (11) and (13) (but not (16))
were also derived in a study of interactions of point de-
fects in fluctuating membranes [32]. Their applicability
is general and not limited to a one dimensional chain.
Experiments - In principle, one could distinguish the
three scenarios in experiments from the sign of ∆∆ Fint
(Fig. 2). Kim et al. analyzed the binding of several differ-
ent pairs of proteins on DNA [3]. The binding free energy
showed a decaying oscillating behavior with alternating
sign which is consistent with an enthalpic allostery (10),
in agreement with the analysis performed by other au-
thors [3, 5, 6, 33]. A fit to (10) with the asymtpotic
expression for Sm(9) is shown in Fig. 3(a). A differ-
ent system was analyzed by Rosenblum et al. [4] who
found DNA-mediated allostery in the binding of bacte-
rial transcription factors ComK. The experiments showed
a cooperative binding (∆∆ Fint<0) for varying spacer
lengths, see Fig. 3(b). The negative ∆∆ Fintindicates
an allostery of (predominantly) entropic type. The data
are fitted (dashed line) against a model containing both
linear and quadratic terms, using a Monte Carlo fitting
procedure [17]. These fields act on several sites reflecting
the extended contact regions of the ComK-DNA interac-
tion. The oscillating component is due to the enthalpic
part, which, as seen above, has a universal oscillatory de-4

caying behavior. In the fit the same value of ϕ= 2π/10.5
as Fig. 3(a) was used. Instead for the correlation length
we used ξE= 22 bp, larger than the value used in (a),
possibly indicating that allosteric coupling is carried over
by different collective variables in the two cases. We note
that the ComK have much larger |∆∆Fint|than the data
shown in Fig. 3(a). It is possible that to quantitatively
describe the ComK data one would need to go beyond
linear elasticity (anharmonic effects) or to more complex
multimodal models [34]. However, the harmonic model
with linear and quadratic terms spanning several sites
generates a ∆∆ Fintconsistent with experimental data.
Simulations - So far we have assumed a model with
distal couplings generating allosteric interactions, using
a generic un. In principle uncould be one of the sev-
eral DNA local deformation modes used in the rigid
base model [9], or a combination thereof. However, ex-
periments indicate that allosteric interactions decay via
damped oscillations, which puts some constraints on un,
as several variables do not have this property. For in-
stance, we can exclude pure bending or twist modes as
candidates for un, as the stiffness eKqfor these coordi-
nates does not produce oscillations with the desired peri-
odicity [17]. Prior work suggested the DNA major groove
width as mediating allosteric interactions [3]. However,
extensive 1 µs all-atom simulations of a 33-bp sequence
showed no signature of periodicity in the groove width
correlations [33]. We have performed simulations us-
ing two different 44-bp sequences for 100 ns, with major
groove width calculated from the algorithm Curves+ [35]
using the setup discussed in [13]. Our results for the nor-
malized propagator Sm/S0=⟨u0um⟩0/⟨u2
0⟩0(with unthe
deviation of the major groove width from the equilibrium
value) are given in Fig. 4(b) and are in close agreementwith those reported in [33]. To extract parameters from
simulations we have calculated the q-stiffness eKqfrom
the equipartition relation (7), as recently done for twist
and bending deformations [13, 36]. A minimal model
with just four poles ±qE,±q∗
E(8) gives
eKq=A(q2−q2
E)(q2−q∗2
E) =A(q4−µq2+λ2) (17)
with Aa scale factor, µ=q2
E+q∗2
Eandλ=|qE|2. We
note that (17) is not of the form (4), but should be inter-
preted as the continuum long wavelength limit ( q→0) of
model (2). Figure 4(c) shows eKqas obtained from sim-
ulation data averaged over two sequences (red circles).
The double-well shaped curve is fitted, for small q, to
(17) giving ϕ= 0.9 and ξE= 1.6 (solid line in the inset
of Fig. 4). The former parameter is close to the double
helix periodicity ϕ= 2π/10.5≈0.6, while the latter ap-
pears to be quite small as compared to experimental data
which predict ξE≈15 bp. We show on the same inset
a plot of Eq. (17) with the latter values for ϕandξE.
We conclude that simulations of the major-groove width
qualitatively support the distal couplings model (2), but
a quantitative matching remains an open challenge, as
pointed out earlier [7, 33]. See [17] for an extended dis-
cussion on possible origins of these discrepancies.
Conclusions - We have studied a coarse-grained model
which predicts three types of allosteric DNA-mediated in-
teractions. One could distinguish between the three cases
(or about the dominance of one of these) from the sign
of the interaction free energy and on its dependence on
the length of the DNA linker sequence separating the two
protein-binding sites. Prior work [3, 5, 6] pointed to some
examples of enthalpic DNA-mediated allostery character-
ized by a free energy of oscillating sign. We have argued
here that recent ComK data [4] show an allostery which
is of predominant entropic nature, as ∆∆ Fint<0. En-
tropic allostery (often referred as dynamic allostery) was
discussed in the case of proteins [37, 38], but it should
manifest itself in DNA as well. The model introduced
here predicts additionally a “mixed” allostery, obtained
when coupling two different proteins in which one exerts
a linear field and the other a quadratic one. This mixed
allostery is of enthalpic nature and we are not aware that
such interaction was discussed in the protein literature.
Differently from the protein case, in DNA-mediated al-
lostery one can vary the spacer sequence length, probing
the decay of ∆∆ Fint, therefore the type of allostery (en-
thalpic, entropic or mixed) should be easier to identify.
By varying the binding sites sequences one can bring in
close vicinity proteins of different types and which cou-
ple differently to the DNA (e.g. predominantly via linear
or quadratic fields), thereby probing the three scenarios
predicted by the model.

ALLOSTERY”
This document is organized as follows. Section I shows
the details of the calculations of the exact expressions of
the interaction free energy ∆∆ Fintfor enthalpic (I B),
entropic (I C) and mixed (I D) allostery. These are given
in the framed equations (33), (40) and (46) and are ex-
pressed as functions of the propagator Sm. These results
are derived for pointwise interactions at two single sites
and are generalized to the case of proteins interacting to
multiple sites in I F. Section II discusses the asymptotic
behavior of the propagator, the allosteric length and its
connection with DNA persistence lengths. Section III
gives some details of the procedure followed to fit the
ComK data. Section IV discusses details of all-atom sim-
ulations.

tion p(u0, u1. . . u N−1), due to the quadratic nature of
the interactions, is a multivariate gaussian distribution.
Integrating all variables but u0andumgives a joint prob-
ability distribution for u0andumwhich is still gaussian

The first term comprises the entropic contribution,
whereas the latter three are purely of an enthalpic na-

are the equivalent of mixed allostery (see (46)).
F. Extended DNA-protein couplings
Thus far we have discussed the effect of proteins on a
single local site. In general a protein will interact with a
few DNA sites and we discuss here the case of extended
DNA-protein couplings.
1. Enthalpic allostery: robustness of oscillating decay
We consider first the case of linear perturbations and
consider the following model
H=H0−na−1X
k=0hkuk−na+nb−2X
l=na−1hl+mul+m (49)
with na,bdenoting the respective protein sizes. We allow
the fields hnto depend on the site. Discrete Fourier

l=na−1hl+me2πilq/N(52)
Using the definition
h∗
q≡Cq+e2πimq/NDq (53)
we can rewrite (50) as

eKq(55)
To get the partition function we integrate on U′
q. The
integration of the term |U′
q|2gives F0the free energy of
the DNA. The second term in (54) contributes to the
excess free energies ∆ Fa+ ∆Fb+ ∆∆ Fint. Expressing
|hq|2in terms of CqandDqwe find

where we used the relations C∗

The terms proportional to |Cq|2and|Dq|2are ∆ Faand
∆Fb. The interaction term itself is given by:
∆∆Fint=−1
2NX
qCqD−q+C−qDq
eKqe2πimq/N(57)
The localized perturbation limit, e.g. −h(u0+um), dis-
cussed in the main text is obtained by setting na=nb=
1 and h0=hm=hin the two sums in (51) (52), which
corresponds to Cq=Dq=hand hence
∆∆Fint=−h2
NX
qe2πimq/N
eKq(58)
which is Eq. (11) of the main text. We find therefore that
an extended linear perturbation generates a q-dependent
term CqD−q+C−qDqin the sum (57). This does not
modify the analytical structure of the leading poles, un-
lessCqD−q+C−qDqvanishes at q=qEas well, a very
peculiar limiting case which we exclude from our anal-
ysis. The conclusion is that the extended perturbation
(49) generates the same asymptotic damped oscillatory
decay as the localized perturbation discussed in the text
(66). This decay is thus robust.
2. Entropic and mixed allostery: lack of robustness of
oscillations

allostery we consider

We omit the details of the calculation which consists in
computing the probability distribution of three variables
p(u0, u1, um+1) which generalizes (18). One then com-
putes the interaction free energy as done above for the
other cases. The final result is9

(61)
by setting S1=Sm+1= 0 in (60). Also (60) describes a
stabilizing interaction ∆∆ Fint≤0. The main difference
in the two cases is that, while (61) vanishes whenever
Sm= 0 and thus has the same zeros as the enthalpic case,
in (60) this does no longer happen. The m-dependence
of the interaction comes from terms proportional to S2
m,
S2
m+1andSmSm+1. The combination of these gives an
overall exponential decay exp( −2m/ξ E) with products of
cosines of different phases which suppress the oscillating
part. The numerical solution of the general case

shows that oscillating components get more and more
suppressed as the number of interacting sites increases
(larger naandnb), see Fig. 2(b) in the main text. Sum-
marizing we expect for this case an asymptotic behavior
of the type
∆∆Fint∼f(m)e−2m/ξE(63)
with f(m) a very weak function of m. A very similar
behavior holds for the mixed case (see Fig. 2(c) in the
main text).II. ALLOSTERIC LENGTH SCALE

where we used the change of variable y≡πq/N and the
expression for eKqin (4). To evaluate the integral one
closes the integration domain in the complex y-plane, as
shown in Fig. 5. Integrals along the two vertical lines
cancel each other by symmetry. The leading large- m
contribution comes from the poles in the integrand with
the smallest imaginary part (closest to the Re( y) axis).
There cannot be poles on the real axis, as this would lead
toeKq= 0 for some real q, hence an instability for that
mode. Indicating the leading poles with

of the poles of eKqare shown in (a,c,d) as red circles. (a-d)
correspond to a model with a single distal coupling K1, with
eKqgiven in Eq. (69) and K1>0 (a-b), K1<0 (c-d). In the
case (a) the leading pole has a non-vanishing real component
(ϕ=±π) which produces oscillations with the highest possi-
ble frequency in the propagator Sm∼(−1)me−m/ξ, shown in
(b). In the case (c) the leading pole has a vanishing real part
(ϕ= 0), which gives a monotonic decay Sm∼e−m/ξ, shown
in (d). The case (e) corresponds to the continuum model (73).
The real part of the pole Re( qE) is close to the minimum of
eKq. Coarse-grained variables characterized by stiffnesses as
in (a) and (c) cannot be responsible for allosteric effects seen
in DNA experiments, as they do not produce the damped os-
cillatory behavior.

minimum min q(eKq)→0, the corresponding mode q∗of
the leading pole becoming unstable. In more complexsituations, with further neighbor couplings one needs to
solveeKq= 0 numerically, as this equation is a higher
degree polynomial in the variable ω.

This model is based on a eKqhaving a minimal number of
zeros. Symmetry requires minimal four such zeros, hence
a polynomial of degree four. We note that (73) is not a
combination of cosines as in Eq. (4) of the main text. It
describes instead a continuum model with energy:

with 0 ≤s≤Lcontinuous coordinate (replacing the
base pair index) and Lthe total length of the DNA. The
right column of Fig. 6 shows plots of the propagators Sm
vs.mcorresponding to the stiffnesses shown in the left
column. As allosteric effects manifest themselves in ex-
periments as damped oscillations, the associated stiffness
is expected to be as in Fig. 6(e).
B. Distal couplings in DNA models
The DNA-mediated allostery discussed in this paper
is due to non-vanishing distal couplings. Such couplings
have been observed in simulations by various groups [10–
14, 18, 19]. Their origin is twofold. Firstly, the coarsen-
ing of local degrees of freedom leads to coarse-grained
variables with couplings that extend beyond nearest
neighbors. Secondly, DNA interacts in a complex way
with solvent and counterions which leads to interactions
which extend beyond neighboring bases.
The ordinary Twistable Wormlike Chain (TWLC)
model, which describes DNA deformations using twist
and bending degrees of freedom, is a very good model
of DNA mechanics at sufficiently long length scales ( ∼
100 bp and beyond). Such model is strictly local and does
not have distal couplings, therefore it is not suitable to
describe DNA at a local scale where such couplings have
been observed ( ∼10 bp). Figure 7 shows the Fourier
space stiffness of bending andtwist modes as obtained
from all-atom simulations. The q-dependence indicates
the presence of distal couplings. The stiffnesses have a
global maximum at q= 0 and minima at q=±N/2 and
are of the type shown in Fig. 6(a). As a consequence, the
correlation functions of twist or bend deformations decay
with alternating signs, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The charac-
teristic correlation lengths was estimated to be ξ≈4 bp
[19]. Such degrees of freedom cannot produce an oscilla-
tory coupling free energy with the double helical period,
as observed in DNA allostery experiments [3]. We can11

deformations (tilt eAt

tion eCq, as obtained from all atom simulations averaging two
different sequences of 44-mers of DNA. Note that the very
different behavior of the two bending stiffnesses of Fig. 7(a):
tilt has a very strong q-dependence, while this is very weak
in roll. This peculiar feature was discussed in [36]. Dashed
lines: Fourier decomposition of the stiffnesses. The correla-
torsSmassociated to these degrees of freedom alternate in
sign as shown in Fig. 6(b). Such a behavior is not consis-
tent with the oscillatory decay of DNA allostery observed in
experiment. Hence allosteric interactions are unlikely to be
carried by pure bending or twist deformations.
therefore conclude that DNA allostery is unlikely to be
carried by pure twist and bending deformations.
In principle there are several other degrees of freedom
describing DNA deformations at the base pair level. A
popular coarse grained model, the rigid base model, in-
troduces 12 degrees of freedom per site (6 intra-basepair
and 6 inter-basepair, see e.g. [20]). In such model DNA
bases A,T,C,G are treated as rigid bodies while transla-
tion vectors and rotation angles are used to parametrize
their relative positions and orientations. The degrees of
freedom describing conformations of the rigid base model
are also characterized by non-local couplings and there-
fore have associated correlation lengths (as shown by
Eqs. (71) and (72) a single non-zero distal coupling is
sufficient to induce a correlation length). The oscillating
interaction observed in experiments puts a constraint on
the coarse-grained variables acting as carriers of the al-
losteric coupling. Such variables must necessarily have a
stiffness of the type of Fig. 6(e). The analysis of simula-
tion data indicates that the major-groove width has the
double-well shaped stiffness which can potentially gener-
ate such oscillating decaying interactions. Our model is
quadratic in the variables un. Some proteins are known
to physically modify the DNA rather strongly so that
anharmonic effects may become relevant. There is cur-
rently little known about anharmonic effects in DNA.
These were recently explored for some degrees of free-
dom [19], although the analysis is far from complete.
In that paper a novel biasing scheme was introduced to
investigate strongly deformed DNA in all-atom simula-
tions. The biasing is necessary as in unconstrained simu-
lations one does not observe anharmonic effects just fromthermal fluctuations. Some degrees of freedom, such as
twist, were found to behave harmonically for a range to
±10 degrees per base pair (see Fig. 2 of [19]), which is a
rather large value considering it affects only two consec-
utive base pairs. Anharmonic effects could be relevant in
the enthalpic case as a quadratic perturbation ∼u2
min
our model suppresses fluctuations, thereby keeping the
DNA deformations within the harmonic regime. The en-
thalpic case with strongly DNA deforming proteins will
be analyzed in future work.
C. Allosteric lengths vs. persistence lengths
In principle any local degree of freedom with distal
couplings has an associated allosteric length ξE. The
long length scale behavior of the DNA is described by
torsional and bending persistence lengths. The allosteric
length is however unrelated to these persistence lengths
as it can be best illustrated using torsional elasticity as
an example. The energy (in rescaled kBTunits) is

The calculation was done for correlated variables and it is
a bit more complex than for the usual Twistable Worm-
like Chain (TWLC) where bending and twist at different
sites are uncorrelated. Hence in the model (75) the ordi-
nary torsional correlation length is related to the q= 0
(long wavelength limit) of the Fourier transform of the
couplings. This can also be seen in the torque ensemble
where the energy becomes:

FIG. 8. Schematic view of the structure of the ComK-DNA
binding interface (red dashed area). There are two “binding
boxes” separated by a linker of mbase-pairs. Each box con-
sists of two regions of fixed sequence of four base pairs each,
separated by a 5 bp variable region. Two proteins bind at
each binding box, so allostery involves in total four ComK.
We model the proteins binding in each box using linear and
quadratic fields in each of the 8 binding sites, as given in
Eq. (80). The 4 bp DNA sequences are mirror symmetric,
hence we use the same field values at sites k= 0,12,k= 1,11,
k= 2,10 and k= 3,9.
which shows that the torque τcouples only to the mode
q= 0. The torque response is governed again by the
q= 0 component of the stiffness eCq.
The allosteric effects we discussed in this paper are
instead linked to the correlator
⟨ΩnΩn+m⟩m≫1∼e−ma/ξ E(79)
where ξEis determined from the leading (complex) so-
lution of eCq= 0. ξTandξEare therefore two dis-
tinct length scales, both linked to eCq. From experi-
ments probing DNA mechanical properties we know that
ξT≈200nm= 600 bp. The other lengthscale is ex-
pected to be of the order of a few base pairs ξE≈5bp
[13]. The ordinary TWLC, considered the standard DNA
model, describes DNA as uncorrelated twist and bend-
ing variables. It is a valid description at length scales
≫ξE. The previous discussion for simplicity was limited
to twist, but for every local variable unthere is an as-
sociated correlation length ξE, defined from correlation
functions as (79).
III. FITTING PROCEDURE OF COMK DATA
We discuss here the procedure used to fit the ComK
data of Fig. 3(b) of the main text. The comK binding
sites consists of two boxes as shown in Fig. 8. Each box
has two 4 bp regions of conserved sequences through-
out various organisms, which are separated by a variable
5 bp tract [4]. Two ComK molecules bind to each binding
box, so that in total four ComK are involved in the al-
losteric communication [4]. To fit the experimental data,
we model the binding of a first pair of ComK molecules
at a binding box by two extended perturbations each
spanning over four sites in order to assimilate the length
of the binding domains within one box. The perturba-
tions are placed at a fixed distance of five sites from one

ing domains. Each of the individual perturbations en-
tails a linear field ( h0, h1, h2, h3) and a quadratic field
(ϵ0, ϵ1, ϵ2, ϵ3) such that the free energy of DNA bound to
a single pair of ComK is given by:
H=H0+3X
k=0
εk 
u2
k+u2
12−k
−hk(uk+u12−k)
(80)
Where the 12 −kaccounts for the anti-symmetric bind-
ing of the two ComK molecules. The binding of a second
pair of ComK proteins is modelled by the same pertur-
bation displaced over a distance of msites. For a given
combination of hkandϵk, ∆∆ Fint(m) is calculated nu-
merically. In order to find an appropriate choice of hk
andϵkfitting the data we implemented a Monte Carlo
algorithm. During each MC step hkandϵkare altered
after which the change is accepted/rejected based on the
Metropolis acceptance criterion. Due to the presence of
linear and quadratic fields the interaction free energy
is comprised of an energetic (Enthalpic and Mixed al-
lostery) and an entropic component. We allow for the
entropic term to be multiplied by an integer prefactor
reflecting the relevance of several degrees of freedom in
DNA-ComK binding.
IV. ALL ATOM SIMULATIONS
All simulations were done using version 2020.4 of Gro-
macs [21] and the Amberff99 parmbsc1 force field (based
on the parm99 forcefield, improved with bsc0 [22] correc-
tions and bsc1 corrections [23]). Water was modelled
using the TIP-3P model [24] non-bonded interactions

was used for electrostatics. Simulations started from two
44bp random sequences. The starting configuration was
generated using 3DNA [25]. The DNA molecules were
placed into a dodecahedral box, leaving 2.0 nm on ei-
ther side of the molecule, with periodic boundary con-
ditions and solvated in a 150 mM NaCl solution after
which the overall charge in the system was neutralised.
This structure was energy minimised with a tolerance of
1000 kJ/mol to make sure no overlap remained between
solvent molecules and DNA. Subsequently, the molecule
was equilibrated in the NVT ensemble for 100 ps where
temperature was kept at 300 K using a velocity rescaling
thermostat [26] and then equilibrated for another 100 ps
in the NPT ensemble at the same temperature but us-
ing a Parrinello-Rahman barostat [27] to fix the pressure
at 1.0 bar. Production runs were performed under the
same conditions for 100 ns for each sequence. All simula-
tions were performed using a 2 fs time step in a leapfrog
integrator, using LINCS [28] to constrain the covalent
bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Afterwards the tra-jectories were analyzed and the groove widths extracted
using Curves+ [35].
Figure 9 shows the eKqas calculated from the two
individual 44-mers random sequences. The stiffness is
weakly dependent on the sequence, suggesting the groove
width deformations can be approximately described by a
homogeneous model. The sequence to sequence varia-
tion for bending and twist deformation is typically much
stronger, see simulation data in [13]. We report in Ta-
ble I the local stiffness ( K0) and the distal couplings ( K1,
K2,K3. . . ) as obtained from all atom simulations data
analysis for major groove width, tilt, roll and twist coor-
dinates.
To produce a propagator Smwith a monotonic de-
cay or a decay with alternating signs (as those shown in
Fig. 6 (b) and (d)) a single distal coupling K1̸= 0 is suffi-
cient. One can think about the equivalent problem in the
one-dimensional ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic Ising
model with nearest-neighbor coupling. Equations (71)
and (72) give the analytical expressions of ξEin these
two cases. To produce damped oscillations with the pe-
riod of the double helix longer range couplings are neces-
sary. It is likely that all-atom simulations do not repro-
duce these types of effects because of either limitations in
the reachable timescales ( ∼µs) or because of problems
with the parametrization. Current all-atom DNA models
are parametrized using classical force fields which have
some shorcomings, as discussed recently in [29]. One of
the conclusions of that paper is that current state-of-the-
art force fields overstabilize nucleic acids suppressing pos-
sible “higher degree conformational transitions”. These
conformational changes may lead to stronger correlation
effects and thus to closer agreement with allostery ex-
periments. There is an ongoing effort to develop more
accurate force fields for nucleic acids [29] and allostery
data could be used as test case.
