ABSTRACT:  
We performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations  on monodisperse 
polymer melts to investigate the formation of shear banding. Under high shear rates, 
shear banding occurs, which is accompanied with the entanglement heterogeneity 
intimately. Interestingly, the same linear relationship between the end -to-end distance 
Ree and entanglement density Z is observed at homogeneous flow before the onset of 
shear banding and at shear banding state, where Ree ~ [ln(Wi0.87)  ξ0]Z is proposed as 
the criterion to describe the dynamic force balance of molecular chain in flow with a 
high rate. We establish a scaling relation between the disentanglement rate Vd and 
Weissenberg number Wi as Vd ~ Wi 0.87 for stable flow  in homogeneous shear and 
shear banding  states . Deviating from this relation leads to force imbalance and results 
in the emergence of shear banding. The formation of shear banding prevents chain from 
further stretching and disentanglement . The transition from homogeneous shear to 
shear banding partially dissipates the increased free energy from shear and reduces the 
free energy of the system.

 I. Introduction  
Shear band ing is a widely observed phenomenon  in geological rocks, colloidal 
solutions, amorphous metals, soft glasses, and polymer  systems.1-8 For polymer 
solutions or melts, shear banding is a localized yield phenomenon during continuous 
deformation, indicating non -uniform deformation within the system. Shear banding in 
polymer solutions was first observed by Callaghan and Gil.9, 10 With  particle tracking 
velocimetric (PTV) measurements , Wang’s group  found  steady -state shear band ing in 
highly entangled polybutadiene solutions  11 and DNA solutions ,12-14and shear banding 
was also observed by other s groups ,15-18 providing  experimental  evidence s for the 
occurren ce of shear band ing in polymer systems. Shear banding also occur s in 
industry  processing such as extrusion, which affect s the deformation of polymer 
materials.19-21 If shear banding  exists  as an intrinsic flow state of polymer ,22-27 the origin 
of shear band ing is of great significance for rheology theory and industry  processing , 
which, however,  is still controversial.  
Different mechanisms have been proposed to interpret shear banding, including  
mechanical instability  and phase separation . The original  tube model support s shear 
banding stems from non-monotonic constitutive curves .28, 29 The imbalance of forces in 
polymer entanglement network was proposed to describe some typical nonlinear 
rheological behaviors and to provide conditions for the occurrence of the accompanying 
entanglement heterogeneity of shear banding.30-33 In polymer solutions, continuous 
stress -enhanced concentration fluctuation was suggested to result  in mechanical shear 
banding, 34-42 which supports that shear band ing can arise  from the monotonic 4 
 constitutive .43 Burroughs  et al. reported shear band ing in an entangled polybutadiene 
solution ,18 which verifies that shear banding  is accompanied by non -local flow 
concentration coupling . Meanwhile, the generalized Gibbs free energy was proposed to 
describe shear banding. Based on mechanical stress -concentration coupling, Peterson 
et al. replaced free energy w ith Lyapunov functional at the condition of constant shear 
stress,44 shear banding is seen as a natural consequence of Lyapunov functional 
minimization. Additionally, p hase separation , as a mechanism of stress -induced new 
phase formation,45-49 can contribute to shear banding  involved in thermodynamic 
driving . Note that  mechanical instability and phase separation are not necessarily 
contradictory on understanding shear banding , but from either a hydrodynamic s or 
thermodynamic s perspective . 
Chain entanglement is the most peculiar structure determining not only polymer 
rheology  50-53 but also other physical behaviors like crystallization, glass transition of  
polymer s.54-56 In polymer  melt, shear banding has been  reported to  accompan y with the 
heterogeneous distribution  of entanglement density .57-60 Analogue to stress -
concentration coupling in polymer solution, n on-uniform stress distribution can be  
generated due to the stress -entanglement density  coupling.  Shear banding  occurs when 
the chain deforms unevenly under non -uniform stress.  Nevertheless, the mechanical  
and thermodynamic instabilit ies during  shear banding formation in monodisperse 
polymer melt are still poorly understood .  
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can give structure changes on molecular 
scale , wherein the d issipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations inherently preserve 5 
 multibody fluid dynamics by maintaining mass and momentum both locally and 
globally .61 Using  DPD simulation can reproduce some  nonlinear rheological 
phenomena such as shear banding ,62, 63  and present  molecular details.  To unveil the 
correlation between entanglement concentration and shear banding , the present work 
employ s DPD  simulation to study the formation process of shear ban ding in 
monodisperse melt. Shear banding  instability is reproduced under  different shear rate s, 
and entanglement concentration fluctuation is the necessary pre -condition for the 
occurrence of shear banding . A correlation between entanglement concentration  Z and 
end-to-end distance Ree can be taken as the criterion for dynamic force balance  during 
shearing . Moreover, the occurrence of shear banding dissipates part of the free energy 
stored in system, and shear banding can also be understood with thermodynamic 
argument . 
2. Simulation  Method  
All sim ulations are performed on open -source code LAMMPS.64 The 
Kremer−Grest model with bending potential is used.65, 66 The n on-bonding interactions

LJ potential is truncated a t rc = 1.1225 σ. The bonding  interactions is given by an

 R0 = 1.5 σ. The chain stiffness is considered by a b ending potential 𝑈𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑑 =
𝑘𝑏(1−𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 ) with kb = 2ε. 
The model of polymer melt contains  1646 chains with chain length N = 300.  The 
monomer density is set as 0.85σ3. The disentanglement time 𝜏𝑑 is about 3.67 × 106τ.57 
Considering the slow relaxation of the melt, t he double bridge algorithm is used to 
accelerate the  relax ation process .66 The mean square internal distances of molecular 
chains in initial equilibrium system  is plotted in Figure S1 of supporting information . 
At equilibrium, the root -mean -square radius of gyration Rg0 is 12.6 σ and the number of 
entanglement points on each chain is Z = 28 (the initial a verage entanglement length is 
10.6), which  is calculated by Z1 + code .67-71 The simulation box with Lx = 76.2 σ, Ly = 
101.6 σ, Lz = 76.2 σ and the p eriodic boundary conditions are set . Then , the polymer melt 
is subjected to shear flow field with different Weissenberg numbers Wi = 5 ~ 1000,  
where  Wi= 𝜏𝑑γ̇, and γ̇ is shear rate. The shear flow is along the x-axis and produces 
a velocity gradient in the y-axis. During shearing, the reduced temperature T = 1 is 
controlled by the DPD thermostat,57, 62 and the simulation time step is chosen as 0.005 τ.  
3. Results  
3.1. The effect of  shear rate. The polymer melt shows different instability 
behavior s under  different shearing rate s. Shear banding shows shear rate dependence, 
which  is consistent with previous simulations .57  
For Wi = 5, no visible shear banding  appears . Figure 1a shows the dimensionless 
velocity profiles  at different strains γ, wherein  V(y) is the moving speed of the monomer  
in the velocity  gradient direction  y, reduced  by strain rate γ̇ and the root -mean -square 7 
 radius of gyration in equilibrium state Rg0. The velocity profile remains linear with the 
change of  γ, indicat ing that shear banding does not occur. The number of entanglement 
points Nz in different layers along y-axis at different  γ is plotted in Figure 1b. In the 
initial system without shear, Nz is unevenly distributed around Nz = 450, but it gradually 
evolves into a uni form distribution around Nz = 420 with the increase of  γ.  
 
Figure 1. (a) The velocity reduced by strain rate and the root -mean -square radius of 
gyration in gradient direction. (b) The distribution of the number of entanglement points 
Nz in gradient direction  at different  γ.  
For Wi = 50 and 100,  flow induces shear banding which is accompanied with 
heterogeneous entanglement distribution. Figures 2a and 2 b give the reduced velocity 
profiles at different γ under Wi = 50 and 100. The velocity profiles remain linear after 
shear is applied, then suddenly switch to nonlinear at γ = 8 and the nonlinearity persists 
in subsequent shearing. The nonlinear velocity profiles show two bands with sharp 
boundaries, which are cons istent with the characteristics of shear banding. In Figures 
2c and 2d, V ′, the derivative of V(y) with respect to y, is presented at γ = 24 when the 
bands is fully formed. The reduced V ′ sharply fluctuates from 0 to 0.35 at Wi = 50, 
and from 0 to 0.4 at Wi = 100. The regions with continuous V ′(y)/γ̇Rg0 > 0.05  are 
8 
 identified as fast band and conversely as slow band. Two bands are observed at Wi = 50 
and 100, and the locations of bands are not fixed. The ranges of coordinates of slow 
band are 0 ~ 18 and 50 ~ 102 at Wi = 50, and 16 ~ 86 at Wi = 100. The width s of slow 
band s are nearly the same of about 70 , always larger than that of fast band . Figures 2e 
and 2f provide Nz in different layers along y-axis at different γ. Nz fluctuates from 430 
to 470 at γ = 0. At γ = 24, Nz fluctuates from 340 to 410 at Wi = 50, and from 325 to 405 
at Wi = 100, while t he difference between the maximum and minimum varies little with  
Wi. Nz decreases in all layers during shearing, but the decr ease is not uniform in y-axis 
and t he heterogeneity of Nz distribution gradually enhance s as γ increases. There is a 
valley of Nz distribution curve around y = 90 at γ = 0, which gradually moves towards 
y = 40 under  Wi = 50. Under  Wi = 100, the valley of Nz distribution curve is y = 100 at 
γ = 24. Nz shows another minimum around y = 40, which however is much larger than 
that in y = 100. The positions of peaks and valleys of Nz distribution curves in Figure 
2e/2f coincide with those of the slow and fast band s in Figure 2c /2d, and also 
correspond to the bands of velocity in Figure 2a/2b, respectively.  9

respect to y, and the number of entanglement points in different layers along the velocity 
gradient direction at different γ at Wi = 50 and 100 . The b lack dotted lines in (a) and (b) 
are linear velocity contrast. The yellow filled areas correspond to the fast band are as, 
and the green ones correspond to the slow band areas .  
Shear band ing weaken s with a further increasing shear rate. Figure s 3a and 3 b give 
the velocity profiles at different γ under  Wi = 500 and 1000 , the velocity distributions 
gradually deviate from linearity as γ increases . The band s at Wi = 500 are relatively 
blurred  and the number of bands is larger than that at smaller Wi, but shear banding 
does occur.  The velocity distribution weakly devi ates from  linear ity at Wi = 1000.  The 
reduced V ′  as a function of y at γ = 48 is plotted in Figure s 3c and 3 d. The reduced  
V ′ fluctuates from 0 to 0.2 at Wi = 500 , and from  0 to 0.14 at Wi = 1000, in which t he 
amplitude of fluctuation is significantly smaller than that at smaller Wi. Choosing  the 
reduced V ′ of 0.05 as the dividing line  between fast and slow bands , there are four 
bands at Wi = 500 and 1000. The total width of the slow bands is 34 at Wi = 500 , and 
10 
 22 at Wi = 1000, which is much smaller than  the width of 70 at Wi = 50/100.  Figures 3 e 
and 3f provide Nz distributed in different layers along  y-axis at different  γ. The 
fluctuation of Nz distribution enhances as  γ increases. At γ = 48, Nz ranges from 2 80 to 
345 at Wi = 500 and from 240 to 320 at Wi = 1000 . The degree of disentanglement  
significantly increases with Wi, and the difference between the maximum and the 
minimum keeps almost constant  at different Wi. The coordinates of the peak /valley of 
Nz distribution  strictly correspond to the position of slow/fast bands, respectively , again 
suggesting strong correlation between  shear banding and disentanglement  of polymer 
chains .

respect to y, and the number of entanglement points in different laye rs along the velocity

(b) as linear velocity contrast. The yellow and green filled areas correspond to the fast 
and slow band areas .  
Wi can be divided into two intervals  depending on  whether shear banding occurs . 
11 
 Under small Wi, shear banding cannot occur  and homogeneous  entanglement remain s. 
Upon  higher Wi, shear banding emerges  accompanied with heterogeneous  entanglement , 
but the clarity of band s is reduced  with the increase of  Wi. With  the increase of  Wi, the 
velocity profile evolv es from the clear  nonlinearity  to a weak deviation from li nearity , 
the maximum value of  reduced  V ′  decreases  and the width of slow band reduces , 
while the difference bet ween the  peaks and valleys of Nz distribution remains in a small 
variation .  
3.2. The evolution of velocity and conformation during shear . As shown  in 
Figures 2 and 3, the distribution of  the reduced  V ′ correlat es with that of Nz. To 
confirm  this correlation, we define the difference of the average V ′ in fast and slow 
bands as ∆V ′, and the difference between the average  Nz in fast and slow bands  as ΔNz. 
Figure 4 depicts  ∆V ′  and ΔNz as the functions of γ during shear.  Upon starting shear , 
∆V ′  and ΔNz evolve synchronously  with a short flat , an increase  and a plateau strain 
regions . Velocity fluctuation  is tightly associated with heterogeneous entanglement  
during the whole shearing process , and the response of velocity  to heterogeneous 
entanglement  is instantaneous.   12

coordinate axis)  and that of Nz in fast and slow bands  (right coordinate axis) as the 
function of  γ at different Wi. 
How do the structural changes at different length scales correlate with shear 
banding? To display  the evolution of the structures at different scale s during shearing , 
the average orientation parameter P2, the average number  of entanglement points  〈Nz〉 
in layers , and the average end -to-end distance 〈Ree〉 are calculated. P2 = 
〈3cos2θi,j  1〉/2 represents the local orientational order on monomers scale,72 where 
𝜃𝑖,𝑗 is the angle between two adjacent string vectors . 〈Nz〉 in strand scale is obtained 
by dividing the total number of entanglement points in the fast /slow bands by the width s 
of fast /slow bands in the velocity gradient direction. Figure 5 depicts  P2, 〈Nz〉, and 
〈Ree〉 in the whole system , and the fast /slow bands as the  function of  γ at Wi = 50, 100, 
and 500. With the increase of γ, P2 and 〈Ree〉 increase  first and then decreases,  while  
13 
 〈Nz〉 decreases  first and then increases . The black , blue, and red  dashed line s mark the 
γ when  stress overshoot  (see Figure S 2 of suppor ting information for stress -strain curve) , 
the difference of 〈Nz〉 in the fast and slow band  regions emerges , and shear banding  is 
fully formed , respectively . Note here “band regions” represent the corresponding 
locations of fast and slow bands before shear banding emerges. The stress overshoot, 
heterogeneous entanglement and shear banding appears in succession . At Wi = 50 and 
100, P2 exhibits  difference between fast and slow band  regions  around γ = 3, 
immediately after the  occurrence  of stress overshoot  at γ = 2 and 2.3, respectively . The 
heterogeneities of 〈Nz〉 and 〈Ree〉 appear later around γ = 4.5 and 5.25, respectively . 
Under all  Wi, P2, 〈Nz〉 and 〈Ree〉 follow a nonmonotonic or a rebound process with γ, 
suggesting  chain retraction and entanglement reconstruction. This rebound 
phenomenon is a necessary but  not sufficient condition for shear banding formation, as 
it is also observed in other short -chain systems where  shear banding  does not occur  (see 
Figure S 3 of supporting information).

 〈Nz〉 in each layer and the average end -to-end distance  〈Ree〉 of chain as the function 
of strain  at (a) Wi = 50, (b) Wi = 100, (c) Wi = 500. The g rey, yellow and green represent 
the changes in the whole system , the fast  and slow band  regions , respectively . The black, 
blue, red dash lines mark the onset strain s of stress overshoot, heterogeneity of 〈Nz〉 
occurs, and shear banding , respectively .  
The average 〈Ree〉 and 〈Nz〉 evolve synchronously but with opposite trend with 
γ during shear ( Figure  5), indicating  chain stretching and disen tangl ement  are correlated . 
Figure 6 provides the end -to-end distance Ree as a function of the number of 
entanglement points  (entanglement density)  Z on each chain at different  Wi. Z decreases 
from right to left of abscissa , corresponding to that Ree increases gradually as  γ increases . 
The arrows between the symbols indicate the direction of the evolution  with γ. Every 
two adjacent points are separated by  strain of  0.75. Under small Wi = 5 where no shear 
banding emerges , shear induces relatively small change for both Ree and Z as Figures 
6a shows , the corresponding monotonic changes of Ree and Z with strain are plotted in 
Figure S4 of Supporting Information.  Except for the shear startup stage, the Z-Ree 
evolves nearly linearly  along the blue dashed line. Here the shear startup stage is 
defined as the shear stage before the stress is close to the overshoot value after shear 
application (a round  0.93 of the stress overshoot  value , see Figure S5 and Table S1).  
Figures 6b and 6c  give Z-Ree plots  under Wi = 50 and 100,  respectively.  Here the yellow  
and green  solid symbol s represent fast and slow band s before the occurrence of shear 
banding,  respectively,  while the corresponding hollow symbols represent those after  
shear banding , where the gradual color fading represent s the increase in  γ. The data are 
connected by arrows along the increase of γ. The whole shear process can be divided 15 
 into four stages: shear startup , homogeneous  shear before shear band ing, the transition 
stage from homogeneous  shear to shear band ing, and shear band ing state. Ignoring the 
shear startup stage, Z-Ree plots falls nearly in a straight line first and  then begins to 
deviate  around γ = 3, where heterogeneity of P2 occur s. Such deviation remains with 
increasing inhomogeneity of the system  until shear banding occurs . When further 
increasing strain after attaining shear banding, Z-Ree plots gradually  returns to the 
original straight line , as illustrated with t he blue d ash line in Figure s 6b and c . 
Interestingly, Z-Ree plots for both flow states before and after shear banding  follow the 
same straight line (see the blue dash line in Figures 6b and c), while deviation only 
exists in the flow states  during the transition from homogeneous flow to shear banding . 
In homogeneous shear and shear b anding stage, the heterogeneity of orientation and 
entanglement  does not change with strain, these two stages are defined as the stable 
flow in subsequent discussions . Figure 6  implies that a balance is held between Ree and 
Z in the stable flow. Accordingly, the imbalance between Ree and Z leads to unstable 
flow and eventually the occurrence of shear banding.  
The same negative linear relation between Ree and Z is observed under Wi = 500 
and Wi = 1000, which is plotted in Figure 6d. In addition to the arrow, the color fading 
also represents γ from small to large . As both Ree and Z rebound back after the 
emergence of shear banding, leading to difficulties in illustrating the increase of γ with 
arrow alone . Under both Wi, Ree changes with Z linearly except the stage of shearing 
startup, and eventually stabilizes . Comparing with those under Wi = 50 and Wi = 100, 
the Z-Ree deviation from linearity in the unstable flow state is small, which is possibly 16 
 due to small difference of V between fast and slow bands.  Additionally, the shear of Wi 
= 25, 75, 250 are performed (see Figure S 6-S8 for conformational evolution during 
shearing), confirming the same linear relationship under different Wi. 
 
Figure 6 The average end -to-end distance as a function of the average number of 
entanglement points per chain at (a) Wi = 5, (b) Wi = 50, (c)  Wi = 100, (d) Wi = 500 and 
1000. The arrows between the symbols indicates the direction  of Z-Ree changes  with γ 
increase. The black  symbols is Z-Ree in the whole system, black  from dark to light 
indicates  γ from small to large . In (b) and (c), the solid and hollow yellow /green  
symbols mark Z-Ree in the fast/slow band before and after the appearance of shear 
banding. The color of hollow symbols from dark to light corresponds γ increase.  
In the linear Z-Ree region under all shear conditions,  
 Ree = Rmax + βZσ (1) 
holds , where the intercept Rmax and the dimensionless  slope β can be obtained by linear 
17 
 fitting. The data points used for fitting at different Wi are given in Table 1 of Supporting 
Information. Rmax is the end -to-end distance of molecular chain when entanglements 
are completely released along Z-Ree curve in Figure 6 . Rmax decreases linearly with the 
increase of lnWi as indicated in Figure S 9 of supporting information, namely Rmax = 
310.3 σ ln(Wi )σ. β for different Wi are plotted  in Figure 7 . Wi = 5 just entering the 
nonlinear rheology region is excluded . β attenuates non -linearly with the increase of Wi, 
satisfying  
 β = ln(Wi 0.87)   ξ0 (2) 
The fitting yields ξ0 = 11.2, which is intrigued that ξ0 approaches the initial average 
entanglement length.  For the coupling relationship between chain stretching and 
disentanglement  upon Wi = 25 ~ 1000,  
 Ree = Rmax + [ln(Wi 0.87)   ξ0]Zσ (3) 
is obtained, which will be discussed later.

3.3. The t hermodynamics in shear.  The free energy changing  with shear is 
18 
 calculated in the framework of q uasi-equilibrium thermodynamics. The mean free 
energy F per chain includ es the contribution s of conformational entropy Scon and 
internal energy  U, wherein U includes kinetic energy and potential energy ( Unonb + Ubond 
+ Ubend), which can be directly output by LAMMPS software.  Scon is given by  
−3
2kB(Ree
√Nl)2
, where N and l are the chain length and the bond length.  The contribution 
of entanglement to free energy is not calculated due to the lack of an accepted  analytical 
formula.  The variations of F during shear is d enoted as ΔF. ΔF as the function of Z at 
Wi = 50, 100, 500 and 1000  is plotted in Figure 8, wherein  shear causes  Z to decrease  
from its initial  maximum  and then increas e. There is a decrease in internal energy 
caused by intermolecular  slippage during shear startup (see Figure S 11 of supporting 
information for internal energy  data).  In the early stage of shear , chain stretching cannot 
immediately offset the change of internal energy , leading to a reduction of  ΔF. In later 
stage of shear , chain stretching dominates  and consequently  results in the increase of  
ΔF. When Z reaches the minimum, ΔF reaches the maximum , where  shear banding 
occurs. Thereafter, Z rebounds  with chain retraction, resulting  in F decreasing  to a 
stable value . For Wi = 500 /1000, the maximum  of the free energy is fuzzy  due to the 
weak  chain retraction and entanglement reconstruction in the system .  19 
  
Figure 8 The mean free energy F of a single  chain as a function of the average  number 
of entanglement points Z per chain during shearing. The blue star symbols mark the  
onset of shear banding at Wi = 50/100.  
Shear banding is a state with lower free energy than homogeneous flow under 
shear . In a given shear flow , shear banding is more stable so there is a transition from 
homogeneous shear to shear banding . In turn,  changing the shear flow  may make 
homogeneous shear more stable .14, 22 To explore whether a transition from shear 
banding to homogeneous flow can occur , we incre ase Wi in a system with shear banding  
already generated at smaller Wi. For the system sheared with Wi = 100 and γ = 25, we 
gradually increase Wi from 101 to 1000 with Wi increment  of 1 per 0.05 strain . Then 
the system is continuously  sheared at Wi = 1000. Figure 9a shows the changes of shear 
stress σxy during the whole shearing process. σxy remains on the plateau before γ = 
25, then increases slightly during γ = 25 ~ 70 with increasing  Wi, and keeps constant in 
γ = 70 ~ 100 with constant Wi = 1000. Figure 9b gives the evolutions of the average 
end-to-end distance 〈Ree〉 of the system and the average entanglement number Z per 
chain  during the whole shearing. Increasing  Wi, Z decreases , while 〈Ree〉 increases and 
20 
 remains constant  around 95σ (with Z = 19) at Wi = 1000,  which  is lower than stable 
〈Ree〉 = 112σ (with Z = 17) when Wi = 1000 is directly applied to the static state  (see 
Figure 6d) . The velocity profiles at the end of each shear stage are shown in Figure 9c. 
There seems already having a tendency for four bands to appear at γ = 25 with Wi = 100.  
The four bands are completely formed during the increas e of Wi and maintain upon  
constant Wi = 1000.  Figure 9d provides the distribution of NZ in different layers at the 
end of each shear stage. The difference between the peaks and valleys of Nz distribution 
further increases during the  shear of increasing  Wi. At γ = 100, the two minima of the 
Nz distribution are the same and the two maxima are different, which results in two slow 
bands with different widths.  The Z-Ree curve during the whole shearing can be seen in 
Figure S 12 of supporting information, wh erein the original linear evolution is 
maintained during the shear of changing  Wi, which gives a different slope  as compar ed 
to that sheared directly with  Wi = 1000.  The simulation of changing  shear rate gradually 
from Wi = 1000 to Wi = 100 is given in Figure S 13 of supporting information. 
Entanglement density gradually increase s and redistribut es as Wi decreases , but the 
velocity profile varies weakly with the decrease of  Wi, which is associated with strong 
disentanglement  at Wi = 1000 in the shearing history.  21

4. Discussion  
The appearance of shear banding is accompanied by mechanical  and 
thermodynamic instability . Force imbalance on molecular chains as a manifestation of 
mechanical instability is first  considered. Ther e are many kinds of interaction  force s for 
molecular chain in the external field, and some  rheological behaviors  can be predicted 
by constructing several forces .30, 33, 73, 74 Gong  et al. give the force -extension curves 
equation  for chains constrained by static topologies , in which the force is proportional 
22 
 to the chain extension and the number of topological  charge .75 Wang et al. proposed the 
retraction force , entanglement cohesion force , and intermolecular force during 
molecular deformation under the external flow field,30, 73 which can explain 
disentanglement under step deformation and yielding behavior in continuous 
deformation. Xie et al. proposed a nonequilibrium kinetic theory for entangled 
polymers , in which blobs in shear flow are subjected to  the retraction force  and a 
intermolecular grip force .33, 74 However, analyzing  various  detailed forces is a challenge 
to describe large strain behavior as the configuration changes after shear banding occurs . 
The subsequent configuration al changes after shear banding do not affect the stress as 
shear band ing emerges i n the stress plateau region , which makes it more difficult to 
introduce stress -related molecule force s in detail . Based on the relationship  between Z 
and Ree in Figure 6 and the mean -field idea, the dynamic force balance of the chain  
during shearing  is described by  Ree ~ [ln(Wi 0.87)  ξ0]Z. 
The effect of entanglement on chain stretching has two sides. On one hand , chain 
stretching is partly applied by entanglement  due to its role as force transmitter , which 
implies that entanglement promotes chain  stretching  under flow . On the other hand, it 
is well known that the maximum stretch ratio of chain is limited by the topological 
constraint from entanglement , suggesting entanglement hinders chain stretching. Based 
on the fitting result Eq. (3)  obtained  in Figure 7, Rmax is a function of Wi. [ln(Wi 0.87)  
ξ0]Z represents the superposition of entanglement effect s. The negative  value of  
[ln(Wi 0.87)  ξ0] indicates the total entanglement effect is to prevent the chain 
stretching, which corresponds to the inverse relationship between Ree and Z shown in 23 
 Figure 7 . Therefore, Ree is Rmax minus the portion of the chain that should be stretched 
but constrained  by entanglement s. 
The linear relation between  Ree and Z reflects a dynamic balance between chain 
stretching and disen tangling. Due to the effects of flow and dynamic entanglement 
constraint, the increase of Ree involves a variety of molecular forces. In flow, the elastic 
retract force fretract against deformation is first considered , which  is proportional to end -
to-end distance Ree 76, namely  
 fretract ~ R ee KBT
σ2  (4) 
The chain under affine deformation is shown in Figure 10a, where entanglement is 
maintained  on the chain and fretract takes effect . Figure 10b gives the schematic diagram 
of the affine deformed chain releasing an entanglement, chain stretching  or the increase 
of Ree is accompanied with  entanglement slipping  and disentanglement . Multiplying the 
both sides of Eq. (3) with KBT
σ2 and moving the Z-related term to the left side, we can 
get:  
 ReeKBT
σ2  [ln(Wi 0.87)  ξ0]Zσ KBT
σ2 = RmaxKBT
σ2  (5) 
Then  the concept of disentanglement force fdisent is introduced, which represents the 
force exerted  on the chain du e to entanglement slipping.  As [ln(Wi 0.87)  ξ0] is 
negative and Rmax > Ree, the fdisent is considered to be in the same direction as chain 
retraction,  satisfying  
 fdisent ~ β KBT
𝜎 =  [ln(Wi 0.87)  ξ0]KBT
𝜎 (6) 
Thus each molecular chain suffers Z disentanglement forces fdisent imposed on the Z 
entanglement points and  an elastic retract force fretract on the two ends . In the 24 
 homogeneous  flow and shear banding , Eq. ( 5) holds. Under  a given Wi, Rmax is constant , 
then a dynamic force balance holds  during flow , namely  
 fretract + Zfdisent  = constant  ~ RmaxKBT
σ2 (7) 
, where the constant  term is equivalent to the retract force when chains  are completely 
untangled  (Z = 0). As different Wi correspond to different  Rmax, Rmax represents the 
response property of molecular conformation under flow, during which disentangling 
and stretching of chain couples together. Under shear with higher Wi, the dynamic force 
balance holds at a lower force level as Rmax decreases with the increase of Wi. The 
relation indicated by Eq. (7)  suggests a dynamic compensation between fretract and Zfdisent  
takes place during disentanglement process in the homogeneous and shear banding flow . 
In another word, the reduction of the total disentanglement force Zfdisent  due to releasing 
entanglement ( the decrease of Z) is precisely taken over by fretract in this process. 
Otherwise, force balance is broken, resulting in the enhancement of structural 
heterogeneity . This happens in the transition flow region, where  the molecular chain 
undergoes a force imbalance and Z-Ree deviates from the linearity  as shown in Figure 
6.

 Figure 10 The  molecular chain in the initial and flow state. (a) Affine deformation of 
chain. (b) The chain releases an entanglement during affine deformation. The blue 
circles represent entanglement constraints.  
From the perspective of thermodynamic,  disentanglement r equires activation of 
entanglement to slip certain distance, which should be in the order  of monomer scale . 
As disentanglement force  given by Eq. ( 6) and β represents the increase in Ree when 
an entanglement is released under flow, suggesting that β can be regarded as the 
dimensionless activation energy . Then β = [ln(Wi 0.87)  ξ0]can be rewritten as  
 exp (β) ~ Wi 0.87 (8) 
Here we introduce the activation energy Ed of disentanglement driven by shear flow, 
the disentanglement rate can be given by  
 Vd ~ exp(Ed/kBT) (9) 
Note that Vd is not the rate with time, but the rate with chain stretching. Considering Ed 
is achieved with chain being stretched for β, there is  
 β ~ Ed/kBT (10)
Combining  Eq. ( 8), we have  
 Vd ~ Wi 0.87 (11) 
for homogeneous  flow and shear banding under high shear rate.  
The calculation method of entanglement affects the numerical result of 
entanglement, but does not affect the scaling relationship between β and Wi. Repeating 
all the entanglement calculations with Z1,67-70 the results are not fu ndamentally 
different from those obtained with Z1+, but with an overall decrease of about 2.2. The 
Z-Ree curves under different Wi and the fitting of β and Rmax based on Z1 are shown in 26 
 Figure S 10 of Supporting Information, which also gives β = ln(Wi 0.87)  ξ0 with ξ0 = 
11.1.  
The generation of shear banding can also be considered as a quasi -phase transition 
to reduce the free energy enhancement caused by shear. The classical phase separation 
requires the free energy of the system to be reduced, but the phase separation in  the 
system far from equilibration  cannot simply be predicted by the reduction of 
spontaneous free energy  alone . The elastic energy of the single -component polymer 
chain in the flow field is stored and the free energy is increased, which  chang es the 
static phase equilibrium of the system.77 In the monodisperse polymer melt , the mixed 
free energy is lacking, the conformational entropy elasticity dominates the free energy  
as Figure 8 shows . The free energy increases before shear banding  occurs, and 
decrease s rapidly  after shear banding occurs, which is like a first -order phase transition 
process.  
Based on Figure 9, the generation of shear banding endows  the system a lower 
free energy  than that of the homogeneous shear . Shear bands are not significant  when 
directly imposing shear at  Wi = 1000. For the system with visible bands, the band s with 
sharp edges  remain when increase shearing rate to Wi = 1000  (see Figure 9) . This result  
indicates that shear banding is more stable than homogeneous shear . From the view of 
thermodynamics, the free energy of shear band ing is lower than that of homogeneous 
shear , which is confirm ed by  comparing elastic energy storage . Ree in the system with 
Wi slowly increas ed to 1000  is smaller than that in the system directly imposed a  shear 27 
 of Wi = 1000, while  the former shows more pronounced shear banding than the latter 
does.   
 
Figure 11 The schematic diagram of the state evolution of molecular chains in shear. 
The yellow curve represents the free energy landscape of homogeneous shear. S1, S2', 
and S3' represent the states of homogenous shear, S2 and S3 represent the states during 
shear banding formation.  
 
Based on the calculated F in Figure 8, a schematic comparison  of the free energies 
between shear banding and homogeneous shear  is provided in Figure 11. The black 
dashed line is the static free energy landscape, S0 is the initial system in equilibrium  
state. The yellow curve shows F changes with Z at homogeneous shear.  With chain 
stretching and disentanglement, F rises to S1, where entanglement heterogeneity 
emerges . In the process from S1 to S2, the entanglement h eterogeneity  gradually 
increase s until shear band ing occur s at S2. Now  the system is divided into the fast and 
slow band s where the corresponding average entanglement are Zf and Zs, and the state 
function densities are  Ff and Fs, i.e. [Zf, Ff] and [ Zs, Fs], respectively.  S2 is an unstable 
state, chain re traction  and entanglement reconstruction  occur  to decrease the free energy , 
28 
 during which stable S3 is reached , and the system is divided into the fast band of [Zf', 
Ff'] and the slow band of [Zs', Fs']. On the F evolution path during shear , the chain s are 
stretched  from S1 to S2, while  the chain retracts at S2' and finally reaches stable state 
S3'. From Figure S 13b of supporting information  and Figure 9, Z at S2 and S3 are 
smaller than those at S2' and S3', respectively.  The occurrence of shear banding inhibit s 
the upward trend of free energy and dissipate s a large amount of free energy , so the 
system achieve s lower free energy  by forming shear banding . Nevertheless, F at shear 
banding state  is larger than that of the homogeneous system  at quiescent , shear banding  
cannot occur in the absence of an external field.  Instead, the uniformity will be restore d 
when removing the shear field .  
The stability of shear bands is associated with  bandwidth . The total free energy of 
the system is equal to Nchains[φsFs + (1 φs)Ff], where φs is the ratio of the width of the 
slow band  and Nchains is the number of chains in the system.  Since t he free energy of the 
slow band is lower  than that of the fast band, the total free energy of the system becomes  
lower when  φs increase s. At Wi = 50 and 100, the ratio of the width of slow band is 
constant and larger than that of fast band , a lower free energy is achieved to maintain  
shear banding.  At Wi = 500 and 1000, the small width of slow band makes the system 
remain in a state with relatively high free energy . The systems are more easily regressed 
to homogeneous shear under thermal disturbances. Otherwise, there are more bands at 
higher shear rates, the curve of entanglement distribution tends to be wavy -shaped (see 
Figure s 3e and 3f), which  possib ly weakens shear banding and reduces the stability of 
bands  compared with well -shaped  ones (see Figure s 2e and 2f) .  29 
 The failure to form visible shear banding at high Wi may be due to the higher 
magnitude of the entanglement distribution fluctuation required, which is prevented by 
the surface tension resulting from the free energy difference between bands. 
Consider ing the heterogeneous free energy distribution, the surface tension between the 
bands will be generated, which will inhibit shear banding. For the visible shear banding, 
the stronger chain retraction and entanglement reconstruction inside the bands reduce 
the total free energy, which compete s with surface tension. Addition ally, shear rate and 
bandwidth do not satisfy the lever principle of gas -liquid coexistence,36, 57 which may 
be due to shear banding is not a phenomenon strictly dependent on shear rate. The phase 
diagram of shear ba nding and homogeneous shear can not be divided strictly by shear 
rate and strain only78, other parameters must be considered such as entanglement 
concentration  fluctuation and shear history . 
 
5. Conclusion s 
In conclusion, the well -entangled polymer melt sheared at different rates were 
performed by DPD simulation. Shear banding occurs at Wi = 50 ~ 1000. The appearance 
of shear banding is accompanied by the heterogeneity of entanglement, and the 
response of velocity to the variation of the entanglement distribution is demonstrated 
to be instantaneous. The occurrence of shear banding is traced  to molecular force 
imbalance. The criterion for stable shear flow at either homogeneous or shear banding 
states is observed to be Ree ~ [ln(Wi 0.87)  ξ0]Z, where dynamic force balance is held. 
Under stable flow, the disentanglement rate is scaling with flow strength as Vd ~ Wi 0.87. 30 
 The formation of shear banding partially dissipates the free energy stored in the system, 
thus achiev ing lower free energy tha n the homogeneous shear. The width of bands will 
determine the stability of the bands by affecting the free energy of the system. 
Regarding shear banding as a non -equilibrium phase transition, the difference of free 
energy between homogeneous shear and she ar banding is the driving force of transition, 
but understanding the nature of shear banding still requires further advances in non -
equilibrium phase transition theory.

76. The proportional relationship between fretract and strain in other theories is no longer applicable under 
the large strain of continuou s deformation. It is known that the tensile force of the ideal single chain is 
proportional to its end -to-end distance Ree. Thus the opposite elastic force fretract ~ Ree.
