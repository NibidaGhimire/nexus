arXiv:2301.12298v6  [math.FA]  27 Feb 2025THE BANACH ALGEBRA L1(G)AND TAME FUNCTIONALS
MATAN KOMISARCHIK
Abstract. We give an aﬃrmative answer to a question due to M. Megrelishv ili, and show that for
every locally compact group Gwe have Tame (L1(G)) = Tame( G), which means that a functional
is tame over L1(G) if and only if it is tame as a function over G. In fact, it is proven that for
every norm-saturated, convex vector bornology on RUC b(G), being small as a function and as a
functional is the same. This proves that Asp(L1(G)) = Asp( G) and reaﬃrms a well-known, similar
result which states that WAP( G) =WAP (L1(G)).

1.Introduction
LetGbe a locally compact group and let ϕ∈RUCb(G) be a bounded, right uniformly continuous
function. We can also consider the same ϕas a functional ϕ∈L∞(G) over the Banach algebra
L1(G). Thus, the properties of ϕcan be explored in two possibly distinct ways. Recall the following
deﬁnitions of weakly almost periodic (WAP) functions/functionals:
(1)ϕisweakly almost periodic as a function ifϕ·G⊆RUCb(G) is weakly relatively compact.
In this case we write ϕ∈WAP(G).
(2)ϕisweakly almost periodic as a functional if the operator Lϕ:L1(G)→L∞(G) deﬁned by
a/mapsto→ϕ⊛ais weakly compact. Here ⊛is the induced Banach module action satisfying
/an}bracketle{tϕ⊛a,b/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tϕ,a⋆b/an}bracketri}ht
for everyb∈L1(G). In this case we write ϕ∈WAP (L1(G)).
WAP functions and functionals have been studied extensively. Some recent developments can be
found in [8] and its references.
Please note that both deﬁnitions of WAP( G) andWAP (L1(G)) are similar in the sense that
they pose the same “size” restriction (e.g., weak relative compactn ess) on diﬀerent subsets of
L1(G):ϕ·Gfor functions and Lϕ(BL1(G)) =ϕ⊛BL1(G)for functionals. In fact, it is known that
WAP(G) =WAP (L1(G)) [35, Thm. 4]. It is therefore very natural to investigate the re lationship
between the analogous deﬁnitions for diﬀerent size restrictions.

One prominent approach from the theory of dynamical systems giv es rise to tame and Asplund
functions and functionals. These notions generalize weak almost pe riodicity and have been of great
importance in the research of function dynamics over groups and s emi-groups (see, for example,
[14] or [26]). Therefore, they can be expected to be useful in this c ontext as well. Indeed, in [29],
Megrelishvili used a very similar approach and asked whether tame/A splund functions are the same
as tame/Asplund functionals over locally compact groups. He manag ed to prove this for discrete
groups but the general case remained open.
In this paper, we answer Megrelishvili’s question aﬃrmatively. Moreov er, we show that it is
actually true for many other “smallness” criteria. Formally, we can c onsider a vector bornology B
on RUCb(G) and deﬁne:
(1)ϕisrightB-small as a function ifϕ·G∈ B (Deﬁnition 5.10). In this case we write
ϕ∈smallg,r(B,RUCb(G)).
(2)ϕisrightB-small as a functional ifϕ⊛BL1(G)∈ B(Deﬁnition 5.1). In this case we write
ϕ∈smalla,r(B,RUCb(G)).
A detailed study of tame and Asplund subsets as norm-saturated, convex vector bornologies, can be
found in [24].
Theorem 6.3. For every norm-saturated, convex vector bornology Bon RUCb(G) we have:
ϕ·G∈ B ⇐⇒ Lϕ(BRUCb(G)) =ϕ⊛BRUCb(G)∈ B.
In particular:
Tame (L1(G)) = Tame( G)
Asp(L1(G)) = Asp(G)
WAP (L1(G)) = WAP(G).
The paper is structured in the following way:
•Sections 2 and 3 contains preliminary material and notations.
•Section 4 is a short study of the relation between tameness and co- tameness in the dual of a
Banach space. In fact, we show a new method for constructing ind ependent sequences in the
dual, proving that every tame weak-star compact subset of V∗is also co-tame (Theorem 4.3).
•Section 5 deﬁnes the general notion of small functions and functio nals over groups and
Banach algebras. We explore some properties of these deﬁnitions a nd also show a few
examples. Mainly, we present a classiﬁcation of tame coordinate fun ctionals on the Banach
algebraL(l1,l1) using the method from the previous section.
•In Section 6, we explore the relations between tame functions and f unctionals on RUC b(G)
for a locally compact Gand prove Theorem 6.3.
•Finally, in Section 7 we present some open questions.

2.Preliminaries
All vector spaces in this paper are considered over the ﬁeld Rof real numbers. Also, we assume
that all topological spaces are Tychonoﬀ and all topological group s are locally compact. If Xis
a topological space, let C(X) andCb(X) be the spaces of continuous, and bounded continuous
functions over X, respectively. A subset Aof a Banach space Vis weakly relatively compact if its
closure is weakly compact. Write BVfor the unit ball of V. We will use the deﬁnitions and notations
of [24].3
2.1.Fragmented Families. Fragmentability, and fragmented functions had been studied in a va ri-
ety of settings (multi-valued functions, uniform spaces, etc.). He re we show a speciﬁc (but equivalent)
version which is most relevant. More general approaches can be fo und in [19, 18, 27].
Deﬁnition 2.1. [18, 27] Let ( X,τ) be a topological space. A (not necessarily continuous) function
f:X→Ris said to be fragmented if for every nonempty subset AofXand everyε>0 there exists
an open subset OofXsuch thatO∩Ais nonempty and the set f(O∩A) isε-small in R.
Deﬁnition 2.2. [9] We say that a family of functions F ⊆RXisfragmented if the condition of
Deﬁnition 2.1 holds simultaneously for all f∈ F. That is,f(O∩A) isε-small for every f∈ F.
Deﬁnition 2.3. [7, p. 22] Let Abe a bounded subset of a Banach space V.Ais said to be an
Asplund set if for every countable C⊆Athe pseudometric space ( BV∗,ρC) is separable, where:
ρC(ϕ,ψ) := sup
x∈C|ϕ(x)−ψ(x)|.
Fact 2.4. [14, Theorem 2.6] LetFbe a bounded family of real-valued continuous functions on a
compact space X. The following conditions are equivalent:
(1)Fis a fragmented family of functions on X.
(2)Every countable subfamilyCofFis fragmented on X.
(3)For every countable subfamily CofF, the pseudometric space (X,ρC)is separable, where
ρC(x1,x2) := sup
f∈C|f(x1)−f(x2)|.
Corollary 2.5. A bounded subset of a Banach space Vis Asplund if and only if it is fragmented as
a family of functions over BV∗furnished with the weak-star topology.
Recall that a Banach space VisAsplund if the dual of every separable closed subspace is separable.
Fact 2.6. (Namioka–Phelps [30]) A Banach space ( V,||·||) is Asplund if and only if every bounded
weak-star compact subset K⊂E∗is (weak∗,norm)-fragmented.
2.2.Tame Families. A sequence of real functions {fn:X→R}n∈Non a setXis said to be (com-
binatorially) independent (see [33, 34]) if there exist real numbers a < b (bounds of independence )
such that /intersectiondisplay
n∈Pf−1
n((−∞,a])∩/intersectiondisplay
n∈Mf−1
n([b,∞))/ne}ationslash=∅
for all ﬁnite disjoint subsets P,M ofN.
Deﬁnition 2.7. [12, 14] A bounded family Fof real-valued (not necessarily continuous) functions
on a setXis atame family ifFdoes not contain an independent sequence.
The following fact can be easily derived using the ﬁnite intersection pr operty characterization of
compactness (see, for example, [23]).
Fact 2.8. Suppose that {fn}n∈Nis an independent family of continuous functions over a comp act
X. Then there are a<b∈Rsuch that for every disjoint, possibly inﬁnite P,M⊆N:
/intersectiondisplay
n∈Pf−1
n((−∞,a])∩/intersectiondisplay
n∈Mf−1
n([b,∞))/ne}ationslash=∅.
Fact 2.9. [14, Lemma 6.4.3] Let{fn}n∈Nbe a bounded sequence of continuous functions on a
topological space X. LetYbe a dense subset of X. Then{fn}n∈Nis an independent sequence on X
if and only if the sequence of restrictions {fn|Y}n∈Nis an independent sequence on Y.
As in [11, 10, 13], we say that a Banach space VisRosenthal if any bounded sequence contains
a weak Cauchy subsequence, or equivalently, if Vdoes not contain an isomorphic copy of l1. Such
Banach spaces appear in many publications (especially, after Rosen thal’s classical work [33]), usually
without any special name.
Deﬁnition 2.10. LetVbe a Banach space:
(1) A bounded subset A⊆Vis said to be tame if it is tame as a family of functions over BV∗.4
(2) A weak-star compact subset M⊆V∗is said to be co-tame if every bounded A⊆Vis tame
as a family of functions over M.
The following fact is a nontrivial reformulation of some known results of Rosenthal.
Fact 2.11. [14, Example 2.5.1] LetVbe a Banach space, then the following conditions are equival ent:
(1)Vis a Rosenthal Banach space.
(2)The unit ball BVofVis tame as a family of functions over the weak-star compact un it ball
BV∗. In other words, BVis tame as a subset of V.
The following is a consequence of [11, Prop. 4.19] and Fact 2.9.
Proposition 2.12. A bounded subset A⊆Cb(X)is tame over Xif and only if it is tame as a
subset ofCb(X).
Proof. WriteV:=Cb(X) and recall that we only consider Tychonoﬀ spaces. It is well known that
Xis embedded in BV∗via the natural map J:X→BV∗deﬁned by ( J(x))(f) :=f(x). Thus, if
A⊆Cb(X) is tame as a subset of V, it is necessarily tame over X.
To see the converse, consider the Stone- ˘Cech compactiﬁcation iX:X→βX. SinceXis Ty-
chonoﬀ,iXis a topological embedding [20, p. 152]. Write ρ:C(βX)→Cb(X) for the restriction
map deﬁned by ρ(f) :=f◦iX. Also, for every f∈Cb(X), writeβf∈C(βX) for its unique
extension. Finally, let W:=C(βX).
By contradiction, assume that Ais tame over X, but not tame as a subset of V. Thus, we can
ﬁnd{fn}n∈N⊆Awhich is independent over BV∗. In virtue of Fact 2.9, βA:={βf|f∈A}is tame
overβX. Using [11, Prop. 4.19], we conclude that βAis tame as a subset of W. Now, consider
Φ:V∗→W∗deﬁned as
∀ϕ∈V∗,g∈W: (Φ(ϕ))(g) :=ϕ(ρ(g)).
It is easy to see that Φ( BV∗)⊆BW∗. Also for every ϕ∈V∗andf∈Vwe have:
(Φ(ϕ))(βf) :=ϕ(ρ(βf)) =ϕ(f).
As a consequence, if {fn}n∈Nis independent over BV∗, then{βfn}n∈Nis independent over Φ( BV∗)⊆BW∗.
However, this is impossible since {βfn}n∈N⊆βAwhich is tame over BW∗. /square
2.3.Topological Groups.
Deﬁnition 2.13. [15, Deﬁnition 4.11] Let Gbe a topological group and U⊆Ga neighborhood of
e∈G. Let us write:
UL:={(x,y)∈G×G|x−1y∈U},
UR:={(x,y)∈G×G|xy−1∈U}.
{UL}U∈N(e)and{UR}U∈N(e)are bases of the left ( µl
G) and right ( µr
G) uniformities, respectively.
2.4.Group Actions. LetGbe a group acting from the left (resp. right) on a set X. For every
x∈X, writeOx:G→Xfor the orbit map deﬁned by
Ox(g) :=g·x(resp.Ox(g) :=x·g).
Also, there is a natural induced right (resp. left) action onCb(X) deﬁned as:
(ϕ·g)(x) :=ϕ(g·x) (resp. (g·ϕ)(x) :=ϕ(x·g) ),
for everyϕ∈Cb(X). Any group has a natural left and right action on itself. In this cas e, we will
writeOl
g/Or
gfor the left/right orbit maps, respectively.
Deﬁnition 2.14. [15, p. 275] Let Gbe a topological group. A function ϕ∈Cb(G) is said to be
right (resp. left) uniformly continuous ifϕis uniformly continuous with respect to µr
G(resp.µl
G).
In this case, we write ϕ∈RUCb(G) (resp.ϕ∈LUCb(G)).
Deﬁnition 2.15. [35] A bounded function ϕ∈Cb(G) is said to be weakly almost periodic (WAP)
ifϕ·Gis weakly relatively compact. We will write WAP( G) for the family of all WAP functions
overG.5
It is known that every WAP function is also right uniformly continuous (see for example [35,
Thm. 2]), so we can always assume that ϕ∈RUCb(G).
Deﬁnition 2.16. [14, Def. 3.1] A function ϕ∈RUCb(G) is said to be tame ifϕ·Gis tame over G.
We will write Tame( G) for the family of all tame functions over G.
The case of Asplund functions needs to be stated more carefully. S uppose that Kis compact,
D⊆Kis dense and F⊆C(K) is a bounded family. As we have established, Fis tame over Diﬀ
Fis tame over KiﬀFis tame over BC(K)∗. In their original deﬁnition (2.3), Asplund sets are only
deﬁned inside Banach spaces. Using Fact 2.4, we can equivalently req uireFto be fragmented over
K. However, this approach is only valid for compact spaces (as far as the author is aware). In order
to use this technique for general groups, we will use G-compactiﬁcations.
Suppose that Gis a topological group that acts from the left on the topological spa cesX,Y . It
is said that Yis aG-compactiﬁcation ofX, ifYis compact, there exists a continuous ρ:X→Y
such thatρ(X) is dense in Y, and:
∀x∈X,g∈G:ρ(g·x) =g·ρ(x).
Deﬁnition 2.17. A function ϕ∈RUCb(G) isAsplund if one of the following equivalent conditions
hold (Corollary 2.5):
(1)ϕ·Gis an Asplund subset of RUC b(G) [28, Def. 7.9].
(2)ϕ·Gis fragmented over every G-compactiﬁcation of G[9, Def. 7.1].
We will write Asp( G) for the family of all Asplund functions over G.
2.5.Vector Bornologies.
Deﬁnition 2.18. [17, Def. 1:1’1-3] A bornology Bon a vector space Vis a family of subsets in V
which covers V, and is hereditary under inclusion (i.e., if A∈ BandB⊆AthenB∈ B) and ﬁnite
unions.
We will say that Bis avector bornology if for every A,B∈ B,α∈R:
(1)A+αB∈ B.
(2) balA:={βx|x∈A,β∈[−1,1]} ∈ B .
Write acxAfor theabsolutely convex hull of A, meaning that:
acxA:=/braceleftBiggN/summationdisplay
n=1αnxn|αn∈[−1,1],xn∈A,N/summationdisplay
n=1|αn| ≤1/bracerightBigg
.
IfBis also closed for convex hulls, it is said to be a convex vector bornology . A bornology Bis said
to besaturated with respect to some topology τif whenever A∈ B, thenAτ∈ B.
Fact 2.19. [24, Prop. 3.2 and Lemma 3.5] LetVbe a Banach space. The weakly relatively compact,
Asplund and tame subsets of Vare norm-saturated, convex bornologies over V. We will denote them
by[WRC ]V,[ASP ]Vand[T]V, respectively. In cases where no confusion can arise, we wil l simply
write [WRC ],[ASP ]and[T].
Remark 2.20.In [24], the authors do not consider weakly relative compact subset s but rather DLP
subsets of locally convex spaces. In virtue of [21, Thm. 17.12], both notions are equivalent in the
case of Banach spaces, so we will implicitly apply their results to [ WRC ]. Similarly, they do not
consider Asplund sets directly, but rather NP subsets, which are a lso equivalent in Banach spaces.
2.6.Actions of Banach Algebras on Their Dual. Suppose that Ais a Banach algebra. As in
[2], the dual A∗can be furnished with an A-bimodule structure via:
∀a,b∈ A,ϕ∈ A∗: (a⊛ϕ)(b) :=ϕ(ba)
∀a,b∈ A,ϕ∈ A∗: (ϕ⊛a)(b) :=ϕ(ab).
The use of a the ⊛notation will be convenient later to distinguish between multiple types of actions
in the case of the group algebra.6
Deﬁnition 2.21. [25, Section 3] Let Abe a Banach algebra. Then
luc(A) :=Span(A⊛A∗),
ruc(A) :=Span(A∗⊛A).
Note that in [1, p. 73], the deﬁnitions are reversed.
Fact 2.22. [25, p. 198] IfGis a locally compact group, then:
LUCb(G) = luc(L1(G)),RUCb(G) = ruc(L1(G)).
Deﬁnition 2.23. [6, Deﬁnition. 15.1] Let Abe a Banach algebra and Mbe anA-module with the
operation ⊛.Mis said to be essential ifA⊛M=M.
Fact 2.24. [6, Cor. 15.3] LetAbe a Banach algebra with a bounded left approximate identity
{eλ}λ∈Λ. Then a left Banach A-moduleMis essential if and only if for every x∈Mwe have
lim
λ∈Λeλ⊛x=x.
Fact 2.25. [6, Thm. 13.4] The group algebra L1(G)has a two-sided approximate identity bounded
by1.
2.7.Classes of Functionals on Banach Algebras. LetAbe a Banach algebra. Every functional
ϕ∈ A∗induces the linear maps Lϕ,Rϕ:A → A∗deﬁned by:
Rϕ(a) :=a⊛ϕ,
Lϕ(a) :=ϕ⊛a.
Deﬁnition 2.26. [25, p. 198] Let Abe a Banach algebra. A functional ϕ∈ A∗is said to be weakly
almost periodic (WAP) if the map Lϕ:A → A∗is weakly compact, meaning that Lϕ(BA) =ϕ⊛BA
is weakly relatively compact in A∗.
We will write WAP (A) for the set of weakly almost periodic functionals over A.
Deﬁnition 2.27. [29, Def. 2.5] Let Abe a Banach algebra. A functional ϕ∈ruc(A) is said to be
tame/Asplund ifLϕfactors through a Rosenthal/Asplund Banach space, meaning tha t there exists
bounded operators α:A →V,β:V→ A∗such that Lϕ=β◦αandVis a Rosenthal/Asplund
Banach space.
We will write Tame (A)/Asp(A) for the sets of tame and Asplund functionals, respectively.
Recall that an operator T:V→Wbetween two Banach spaces is weakly relatively com-
pact/Asplund/tame if T(BV) is weakly relatively compact/Asplund/tame in W, respectively. The
following fact is a consequence of the Davis-Figiel-Johnson-Pe/suppress lczy ´ nski factorization which can be
found in [4]. Its application to reﬂexive, Asplund and Rosenthal spac es can be found in [4, Cor. 3],
[7, Sec. 1.3], [11, Thm. 6.3], respectively.
Fact 2.28. LetT:V→Wbe an operator between Banach spaces. Then Tis weakly relatively
compact/Asplund/tame if and only if it factors through a reﬂ exive/Asplund/Rosenthal Banach space.
Corollary 2.29. LetAbe a Banach algebra. A functional ϕ∈ruc(A∗)is Asplund/tame if and
only ifLϕ(BA)is Asplund/tame as a subset of A∗.
2.8.Bounded Uniformly Equicontinuous Functions.
Deﬁnition 2.30. [31] A subset F⊆RUCb(G) (resp. LUC b(G)) is said to be right (resp. left)
bounded uniformly equicontinuous (UEB) if it is bounded and for every ε > 0 there exists an
entourageδ∈µr
G(resp.µl
G) such that:
(g,h)∈δ⇒ ∀ϕ∈F:|ϕ(g)−ϕ(h)|<ε.7
Fact 2.31. [31, Lemma 4.2.1] For a topological group Gwe have:
F⊆RUCb(G)is right UEB ⇒G·F=/uniondisplay
{G·ϕ|ϕ∈F}is right UEB
F⊆LUCb(G)is left UEB ⇒F·G=/uniondisplay
{ϕ·G|ϕ∈F}is left UEB .
In particular:
ϕ∈RUCb(G)⇒G·ϕis right UEB
ϕ∈LUCb(G)⇒ϕ·Gis left UEB .
Remark 2.32.In [31], the authors use an opposite notation. Namely, their LUC is ou r RUC and
vice versa. We adapted their results to ﬁt our notation.
Deﬁnition 2.33. [31] The right UEB topology on RUC b(G)∗is the topology of uniform convergence
on right UEB subsets of RUC b(G). Namely, a net {µλ}λ∈Λ⊆RUCb(G)∗converges to µ∈RUCb(G)∗
in the right UEB topology if and only if for every UEB subset F⊆RUCb(G) andε>0 there exists
λ0∈Λ such that:
∀λ0≤λ∈Λ∀ϕ∈F:|/an}bracketle{tϕ,µλ−µ/an}bracketri}ht|<ε.
The left UEB topology on LUC b(G)∗is deﬁned analogously.
LetGbe a locally compact group. A point mass is a measure ρofGsuch thatρ(A) = 1A(g) for
someg∈G. A measure on Gis said to be molecular if it a linear combination of point masses [32,
Def. 5.10]. Write Mol( G) for the space of all molecular measures.
Fact 2.34. [32, Thm. 6.6 and 8.18] LetGbe a locally compact group. Then Mol(G)∩BM(G)is right
and left UEB-dense in BM(G).
3.Group and Algebra Actions with Locally Compact Groups
As we have mentioned before, we are aiming to study the relationship between the dynamics
of elements of L∞(G) as functions and as functionals. This could be done using convolutio ns and
translations only. However, we ﬁnd that these phenomena are bes t described through the language
of group and algebra actions. In this section, we outline some neede d deﬁnitions and properties
regarding the group algebra and related objects.
In many cases, the literature contains several sensible ways to ma ke each deﬁnition. For exam-
ple, a group Gcan act isometrically on L1(G) from the left either via ( g⊙a)(h) =a(g−1h) or
(g⊙a) =a(hg)∆(g). Here we will make a coherent choice preferable for our needs. We include
some self-contained proofs in the appendix for the convenience of the reader.
We conclude this section by recalling some known facts about the spa ce of ﬁnite Radon measures
which will also be needed later.
3.1.Basic Deﬁnitions. LetGbe a locally compact group and λbe its left Haar measure. As in
[15, Thm. 15.12], we will write ∆: G→R+for the modular function of G, namely the continuous
homomorphism satisfying:
∀g∈G:λ(A·g) = ∆(g−1)λ(A),
for every measurable set A⊆G. We write L1(G) andL∞(G) for the spaces of absolutely integrable
functions and essentially bounded functions over G, respectively. We also identify L∞(G) as the
dual ofL1(G) via the map:
∀a∈L1(G),ϕ∈L∞(G) :/an}bracketle{ta,ϕ/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tϕ,a/an}bracketri}ht:=/integraldisplay
Ga(g)ϕ(g)dλ(g).
The involution /tildewide·:L1(G)→L1(G) is deﬁned as:
/tildewidea(g) :=a(g−1)∆(g−1).
We also have:
˘a(g) :=a(g−1).8
Fact 3.1. [15, Thm. 15.14] For everyϕ∈L1(G)we have:
/integraldisplay
G/tildewideϕ(g)dλ(g) =/integraldisplay
Gϕ(g−1)∆(g−1)dλ(g) =/integraldisplay
Gϕ(g)dλ(g).
Corollary 3.2. For everya∈L1(G)andg∈G, we have:
/integraldisplay
Ga(hg)∆(g)dλ(h) =/integraldisplay
Ga(h)dλ(h).
The proof is given in the Appendix.
Suppose that a,bare both measurable functions on G. Their convolution a⋆b is deﬁned as:
(a⋆b)(g) :=/integraldisplay
Ga(h)b(h−1g)dλ(h).
Note that this integral is not necessarily convergent.
Fact 3.3. [15, Cor. 20.14, 20.19]
(1)Ifa,b∈L1(G), thena⋆b∈L1(G), and/bardbla⋆b/bardbl1≤ /bardbla/bardbl1/bardblb/bardbl1. In other words, L1(G)together
with convolution is a Banach algebra.
(2)Ifa∈L1(G)andϕ∈L∞(G), thena⋆ϕ∈L∞(G)andϕ⋆˘a∈L∞(G).
Fact 3.4. [16, 32.45] For every locally compact group we have:
L1(G)⋆L∞(G) =L1(G)⋆RUCb(G) = RUCb(G),
L∞⋆˘L1(G) = LUCb(G)⋆˘L1(G) = LUCb(G),
where ˘L1(G) ={˘a|a∈L1(G)}.
3.2.Actions and Their Properties. It is clear that Gcan induce a group action on both L1(G)
andL∞(G). As we have just seen, L1(G) can also induce an action on L∞(G). We will soon give a
list of deﬁnitions for these actions, and then show some of their pro perties:
(1) Relationship to duality - Lemmas 3.7 and 3.8.
(2) Associativity - Proposition 3.9.
(3) Relationship to convolution - Proposition 3.10.
To avoid possible confusions, we will use diﬀerent symbols depending o n the action:
(1) Ifg∈Ganda∈L1(G), we will write g⊙aanda⊙g.
(2) Ifg∈Gandϕ∈L∞(G), we will write g·ϕandϕ·g.
(3) Ifa∈L1(G) andϕ∈L∞(G), we will write a⊛ϕandϕ⊛a. This is the same notation used
in Subsection 2.6, and we will see that the two deﬁnitions agree (Lemm a 3.7).
We will also exclusively use f ⋆g to represent function convolution, whether they belong to L1(G)
orL∞(G).
Deﬁnition 3.5. Letg,h∈G,a,b∈L1(G) andϕ∈L∞(G).

Note that the deﬁnition of the G-action onL∞(G) coincides with the notions of Subsection 2.4,
so using the same notation is justiﬁed. Conversely, the G-action on L1(G) is distinguished, and
one must be cautious in cases of functions belonging to L1(G)∩L∞(G). We will always use the
appropriate symbol ( ·or⊙) and thus avoid possible confusions.
Remark 3.6.These actions are well-deﬁned, meaning that:
g⊙a,a⊙g∈L1(G) anda⊛ϕ,ϕ⊛a,g·ϕ,ϕ·g∈L∞(G).9
In fact, they respect the norms of L1(G) andL∞(G) in the following sense:

4.Relation Between Tameness and Co-Tameness
LetVbe a Banach space and M⊆V∗be a weak-star compact subset. Here we will study the
relation between Mbeing tame and co-tame.
Lemma 4.1. LetKbe a compact space and F={fn}n∈N⊆C(K)be an independent sequence over
K. Writer:K→RC(K)for the evaluation map. Then there exists a sequence {xn}n∈N⊆Ksuch
that{r(xn)}n∈Nis independent over F.
Proof. Leta < b∈Rbe the bounds of independence of F, and letZ⊆ {0,1}Nbe the subset
of ﬁnitely supported sequences. It is known that Zis countable, so let Z={η(n)}n∈Nbe an
enumeration of Z. Writeν(m):={η(n)
m}n∈N∈ {0,1}Nform∈N. In virtue of Fact 2.8, there exists
somexm∈Ksuch that
fn(xm)∈/braceleftBigg
(−∞,a]ν(m)
n= 1
[b,∞)ν(m)
n= 0.
We claim that {xm}m∈Nis independent over Fwith boundaries a < b . Indeed, suppose that
N,M⊆Nare ﬁnite and disjoint. We need to ﬁnd f∈Fsuch that
∀k∈N,m∈M:f(xk)≤aandf(xm)≥b.
Consider the characteristic function 1 N∈Z. There exists some n0∈Nsuch thatη(n0)= 1N. Note
that for every k∈N,m∈M, we haveν(k)
n0:=η(n0)
k= 1N(k) = 1 and similarly, ν(m)
n0= 0. Thus
∀k∈N,m∈M:fn0(xk)≤aandfn0(xm)≥b.
/square
Remark 4.2.The intuition for the previous proof comes from the case of the sta ndard basis {en}n∈N⊆l1
and the dual ball Bl∞[5, p. 211, exercise 1]. We can construct a sequence {ϕ(n)}n∈N⊆Bl∞such
that for every choice c1,...,cN∈R, there is at least one coordinate k∈Nsuch that:
∀1≤n≤N:ϕ(n)(ek) = sign(cn),
and therefore /vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleN/summationdisplay

In particular, let {ν(m)}m∈Nbe a lexicographic enumeration of all the ﬁnite sequences of words o f
{−1,1}. We can deﬁne ϕn(em) :=ν(m)
n.11
Theorem 4.3. LetVbe a Banach space and let M⊆V∗be a weak-star compact subset. If Mis
tame as a bounded subset of V∗(i.e., tame as a family of functions over BV∗∗), then it is co-tame.
Proof. By contradiction, assume that Mis not co-tame. We can therefore ﬁnd a sequence A={xn}n∈N
inBVsuch thatAis independent over M. Applying Lemma 4.1, we can ﬁnd a sequence S⊆M
which is independent over A. WriteJ:V→V∗∗for the canonical embedding. It is easy to see that
S⊆Mis also independent over J(A)⊆BV∗∗. As a consequence, Mis not tame, a contradiction. /square
Note that the converse of Theorem 4.3 need not be true. Consider V:=c0andM:=Bl1(recall
thatc∗
0=l1). It is easy to see that Mis co-tame since Vitself is Rosenthal (in fact Asplund having
a separable dual), but Mis clearly not tame. The following example shows that it needn’t be the
case forL∞spaces.
Example 4.4.There exists a bounded sequence Minl∞which is:
(1) weak-star compact;
(2) independent over the standard basis {en}n∈N;
(3) co-tame.
Namely,M:={0}∩{{α(m)
n}n∈N}m∈N⊆l∞and:
α(m)
n:= the coeﬃcient of 2min the dyadic expansion of n
for 0≤n,m∈N.
α(m)
nm= 0m= 1m= 2...
n= 0 0 0 0...
n= 1 1 0 0...
n= 2 0 1 0...
n= 3 1 1 0...
n= 4 0 0 1...
n= 5 1 0 1...
n= 6 0 1 1...
n= 7 1 1 1...
...............
Proof.
(1) It is easy to see that Mis bounded and it is known that the weak-star topology coincides
with the topology of coordinatewise convergence on bounded subs ets ofl∞. Moreover,
lim
m∈Nα(m)
n= 0 for every n∈N. Therefore
lim
m∈Nα(m)= 0∈M.
In other words, Mis a weak-star converging sequence together with its limit, hence a w eak-
star compact subset.
(2) Indeed, suppose that N,M⊆Nare disjoint and ﬁnite. We will ﬁnd n0∈Nsuch that
/an}bracketle{tα(m),en0/an}bracketri}ht=/braceleftBigg
1m∈N
0m∈M.
Write
n0:=/summationdisplay
k∈N2k.
Now, by deﬁnition
/an}bracketle{tα(m),en0/an}bracketri}ht=α(m)
n0=/braceleftBigg
1m∈N
0 else,
as required.12
(3) By contradiction, assume that Mis not co-tame. As a consequence, there is some subset
A⊆l1which is independent over M. However, since Mwas shown to be weak-star compact,
Fact 2.8 would imply that Mhas cardinality equal or larger than the continuum, which is
clearly false as Mis countable.

5.Small Functions and Functionals
5.1.Small Functionals on Banach Algebras. We use bornologies to generalize WAP, Asplund
and tame functionals (deﬁned in Subsection 2.7).
Deﬁnition 5.1. LetAbe a Banach algebra and Bbe a vector bornology on ruc( A). A functional
ϕ∈ruc(A) is said to be rightB-small ifLϕ(BA)∈ B. Recall that Lϕ(BA) =ϕ⊛BA⊆ A∗. We
will also write small a,r(B,ruc(A∗)) for the set of all right B-small functionals. Here “a” stands for
“algebra”.
Remark 5.2.Analogous deﬁnitions could be made for the left action.
We will write small a,r([WRC ],RUCb(G)),smalla,r([ASP ],RUCb(G)),smalla,r([T],RUCb(G))
for the right small functionals induced by the weakly relatively compa ct, Asplund and tame bornolo-
gies onL1(G) (Fact 2.19).
Remark 5.3.A functional is WAP in the sense of [35], if and only if it is right [ WRC ]-small. A
functional is tame/Asplund in the sense of [29], if and only if it is right [ T]-small/[ASP ]-small. In
other words:
WAP (L1(G)) = small a,r([WRC ],RUCb(G)),
Asp(L1(G)) = small a,r([ASP ],RUCb(G)),
Tame (L1(G)) = small a,r([T],RUCb(G)).
Proposition 5.4. The set smalla,r(B,ruc(A∗))of all right B-small functionals on Ais a linear
subspace of A∗.
Proof. First, suppose that ϕ,ψ∈smalla,r(B,ruc(A∗)) andα∈R. It is easy to see that:
Lϕ+αψ(BA) = (Lϕ+αLψ)(BA)
⊆Lϕ(BA) +αLψ(BA).
By deﬁnition, Lϕ(BA) andLψ(BA) are right B-small. Since Bis a vector bornology, their linear
combination is also right B-small, as required. /square
Example 5.5.Consider the Banach algebra A:=l1together with pointwise multiplication. Then
every functional ϕ∈ A∗is right [WRC ]-small.
Proof. Letϕ∈l∞=A∗. We will denote multiplication in Abya⋆b fora,b∈l1, and use ⊛for the
module operation on l∞. We will show that ϕ⊛Bl1is weakly relatively compact. It is easy to see
that for every a∈l1we have:
ϕ⊛a=ϕ⋆a,
where in the right hand side we consider element-wise multiplication. As a consequence,
ϕ⊛Bl1⊆ /bardblϕ/bardbl∞Bl1⊆c0∩/bardblϕ/bardbl∞Bl∞.
Therefore, it is enough to show that Bl1⊆l∞is weakly compact. Indeed, Bl1is closed in the
topology of coordinatewise convergence, and therefore also wea k-star closed in l∞. In virtue of the
Banach–Alaoglu theorem, Bl1is weak-star compact. In other words, it is compact with respect t o
the weak topology induced from l1=c∗
0. However, Bl1⊆c0, so this topology coincides with the
weak topology of c0⊆l∞, proving the desired result. /square13
Question 5.6. LetXbe a Banach space and consider the Banach algebra A=L(X,X )of bounded
linear maps with the operator norm. Every x∈Xandϕ∈X∗induces a functional Φx,ϕ∈ A∗
deﬁned by:
Φx,ϕ(T) :=ϕ(T(x)).
What are the combinations (x,ϕ)∈X×X∗such that Φx,ϕis WAP/Asplund/tame (i.e., right
[WRC ]-small/ [ASP ]-small/ [T]-small)?
Remark 5.7.Note that Φ x,ϕ= Φx,ϕ⊛idA, so Φx,ϕbelongs to ruc( A).
Example 5.8.Consider A=L(l1,l1). Then Φ x,ϕis not tame for every 0 /ne}ationslash=x∈l1,0/ne}ationslash=ϕ∈l∞.
Proof. We need to show that Φ x,ϕ⊛BAhas anl1-sequence. Using Lemma 4.1, ﬁnd
{ψn}n∈N⊆ {0,1}N⊆Bl∞
which are independent over {en}n∈N⊆l1with bounds 0 <1. Since 0 /ne}ationslash=ϕ, we can ﬁnd y0∈l1such
thatϕ(y0) = 1. Now, deﬁne Sn∈BAvia:
Sn(x) :=1
/bardbly0/bardblψn(x)y0.
Using the Hahn-Banach theorem, we can ﬁnd Tm∈ A such that:
Tm(x) =/bardblx/bardblem.
We claim that {Φx,ϕ⊛Sn}n∈Nis independent over {Tm}m∈N⊆BA⊆BA∗∗. Indeed, by the
construction of {ψn}n∈N, for every ﬁnite, disjoint M,P⊆Nwe have some m(M,P )∈Nsuch that
ψn(em(M,P))∈/braceleftBigg
[1,∞)n∈M
(−∞,0]n∈P.
Therefore:
(Φx,ϕ⊛Sn)(Tm(M,P)) := Φx,ϕ(Sn◦Tm(M,P))
=ϕ((Sn◦Tm(M,P))(x))
=ϕ(Sn(Tm(M,P)(x)))
=ϕ(Sn(/bardblx/bardblem(M,P))
=/bardblx/bardblϕ/parenleftbigg1

Question 5.9. Is there any non-trivial tame functional on the Banach algeb raL(l1,l1)?
5.2.Small Functions on Groups. LetGbe a locally compact group.
Deﬁnition 5.10. LetBbe a vector bornology on RUC b(G). A function ϕ∈RUCb(G) is said to be
rightB-small as a function ifϕ·G∈ B. We will write small g,r(B,RUCb(G)) for the set of all right
B-small functions (here “g” stands for “group”).
Remark 5.11.Analogous deﬁnitions could be made for the left action.
Remark 5.12.In virtue of Deﬁnitions 2.15 and 2.17, and Proposition 2.12, we have:
WAP(G) = small g,r([WRC ],RUCb(G)),
Asp(G) = small g,r([ASP ],RUCb(G)).
Tame(G) = small g,r([T],RUCb(G)).
Remark 5.13.In the case of WAP functions, it is known that a function is left WAP if a nd only if
it is right WAP [3, Cor 1.12].14
6.Relation Between Functions and Functionals
LetGbe a locally compact group. It is known that WAP( G) =WAP (L1(G)) [35, Thm. 4]. In
[29, Question 3.6], Megrelishvili asked if Tame( G) =Tame (L1(G)). In this section we will show that
it is true.
The following is a generalization of a similar result for abelian groups whic h can be found in [22,
p. 236].
Proposition 6.1. For everyϕ∈RUCb(G)(resp.ϕ∈LUCb(G)), we have ϕ·G⊆ϕ⊛BL1(G)
(resp.G·ϕ⊆BL1(G)⊛ϕ).
Proof. We will only prove the case of RUC b(G), the other one is similar. First, by Fact 2.25 we
can ﬁnd an approximate identity {eλ}λ∈Λ⊆BL1(G). Next, applying Fact 3.11 and Fact 2.24 we
conclude that
∀ψ∈RUCb(G) : lim
λ∈Λψ⊛eλ=ψ.
As a consequence, ϕ∈{ϕ⊛eλ}λ∈Λ⊆ϕ⊛BL1(G). Finally, in virtue of Remark 3.6, for every g∈G
we haveBL1(G)⊙g=BL1(G), and therefore:
ϕ·g∈ϕ⊛BL1(G)·g=(ϕ⊛BL1(G))·g=
3.9.10ϕ⊛(BL1(G)⊙g) =ϕ⊛BL1(G).
The ﬁrst equality is a consequence of the translation map ϕ/mapsto→ϕ·gbeing an isometry. This is true
for everyg∈G, proving the desired result. /square
Theorem 6.2. For a locally compact group G,
∀ϕ∈LUCb(G) :acx (G·ϕ) =BL1(G)⊛ϕ
∀ϕ∈RUCb(G) :acx (ϕ·G) =ϕ⊛BL1(G).
Proof. One inclusion was proven in Proposition 6.1. All that is left is to show tha t:
∀ϕ∈LUCb(G) :acx (G·ϕ)⊇BL1(G)⊛ϕ
∀ϕ∈RUCb(G) :acx (ϕ·G)⊇ϕ⊛BL1(G).
We will only prove the RUC bcase, the other is very similar. Indeed, suppose that ϕ∈RUCb(G),
a∈BL1(G)andε>0. We need to ﬁnd some {αk}n
k=1⊆R, and{gk}n
k=1⊆Gsuch that:
/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleϕ⊛a−n/summationdisplay

k=1|αk| ≤1. In virtue of Fact 2.31, we conclude that G·ϕis right UEB. Now, applying Fact

Theorem 6.3. For every norm-saturated, convex vector bornology Bwe have:
smalla,r(B,RUCb(G)) = small g,r(B,RUCb(G)).
In particular:
Tame (L1(G)) = Tame( G),
Asp(L1(G)) = Asp(G),
WAP (L1(G)) = WAP(G).
Proof. First, note that by deﬁnition, ϕ∈smalla,r(B,RUCb(G)) if and only if ϕ⊛BL1(G)∈ B. Since
Bis norm-saturated, this is equivalent to ϕ⊛BL1(G)also belonging to B. In virtue of Theorem 6.2,
this is the same as having acx (ϕ·G)∈ B. Leveraging Bbeing norm-saturated and convex, we can
alternatively write ϕ·G∈ B. By deﬁnition, ϕ∈smallg,r(B,RUCb(G)). This shows the equivalence
of the two deﬁnitions.
The implications for tame, Asplund and WAP functions are a conseque nce of Remarks 5.3, 5.12
and Fact 2.19. /square
Remark 6.4.The previous theorem is also true when considering leftdeﬁnitions rather than right
ones.
Example 6.5.The following are examples of interesting functions which are Asplund /tame on some
locally compact group G. As a consequence of the previous theorem, they are also Asplund /tame
as functionals over L1(G).
(1) The function arctan ∈L∞(R) is Asplund but not WAP [28, Example 7.19.3].
(2) The Fibonacci bisequence on Zis tame but not Asplund [14, Example 6.1.2].
7.Open Questions
Question 7.1. We constrained ourselves to RUCb(resp. LUCb) functionals in Deﬁnition 5.1.
However, it is reasonable to make the same deﬁnition for gene ral elements of L∞(G). For example,
we can say that a (not necessarily right uniformly continuou s) functional ϕ∈L∞(G)isgeneralized
tameifϕ⊛BL1(G)is a tame subset of L∞(G).
What can be said about such functionals? Are there any intere sting examples which don’t belong
toRUCb(G)?16
Question 7.2. As mentioned in Remark 5.13, every left WAP function is also a right WAPfunction.
Is it also the case for Asplund and tame bornologies?
In other words, if ϕ·Gis an Asplund/tame subset, does it imply that G·ϕis an Asplund/tame
subset.
Question 7.3. It is known that a functional ϕ∈ A∗is WAP if and only if
∀Θ,Ω∈ A∗∗: (Θ/squareΩ)(ϕ) = (Θ♦Ω)(ϕ)
where/squareand♦are the ﬁrst and second Arens products.
Is there a similar algebraic characterization for tame func tionals?

Proof. In the following progression, the Fubini-Tonelli theorem [15, Thm. 13 .10] is referred to as
“F.T.”. A justiﬁcation will appear later.

To justify the application of the Fubini-Tonelli theorem, we need to s how that any of the integrals
are absolutely convergent. Indeed, using Remark 3.6:
/integraldisplay
G/integraldisplay
G|b(g)ϕ(h)(g⊙a)(h)|dλ(h)dλ(g)≤ /bardblϕ/bardbl∞/integraldisplay
G/integraldisplay
G|b(g)(g⊙a)(h)|dλ(h)dλ(g)
=/bardblϕ/bardbl∞/integraldisplay
G|b(g)|/bardblg⊙a/bardbl1dλ(g)
=/bardblϕ/bardbl∞/integraldisplay
G|b(g)|/bardbla/bardbl1dλ(g)
=/bardblϕ/bardbl∞/bardbla/bardbl1/integraldisplay
G|b(g)|dλ(g)
=/bardblϕ/bardbl∞/bardbla/bardbl1/bardblb/bardbl1<∞.
A very similar argument justiﬁes the second application of the Fubini- Tonelli theorem. /square
