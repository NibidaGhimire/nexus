Abstract
The Nelson-Seiberg theorem dictates conditions for the spo ntaneous breaking of
thesupersymmetryinWess-Zuminomodelswithgeneric, poss iblynon-renormalizable,
superpotential; the existence of the R-symmetry is necessa ry while the spontaneous
breakingoftheR-symmetryissuﬃcient. Ifwerestrictourse lvestogenericbutrenor-
malizable theories, however, there exist Wess-Zumino mode ls whose vacua break the
R-symmetry spontaneously while preserving the supersymme try. The classiﬁcation
and conditions of such renormalizable exceptions are under active study. We give
some new examples of spontaneous breaking of the R-symmetry with preserved
supersymmetry that are not covered in the literature.1 Introduction
Supersymmetry is a beautiful theoretical framework to unify mat ter and force, yet it has
not been observed in particle physics experiments. If supersymme try exists in fundamen-
tal physics, it must be spontaneously broken in the current univer se. The spontaneous
breaking of the supersymmetry in particle physics is attractive bec ause it may explain a
hierarchy problem as well as a dark matter problem in particle physics .
In many situations, even with the strong gauge dynamics involved, a study of the
spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry can be reduced to a stu dy of eﬀective Wess-
Zumino models. In a classic paper [1], Nelson and Seiberg gave the cond ition for the
spontaneousbreakingofthesupersymmetryinWess-Zuminomode lswithgeneric, possibly
non-renormalizable, superpotential; the existence of the R-symm etry is necessary while
the spontaneous breaking of the R-symmetry is suﬃcient.
Despite the beauty of the Nelson-Seiberg theorem, the assumptio n of the theorem
may not be met in actual examples. If we restrict ourselves to gene ric but renormalizable
theories, forinstance, thereexist“generic”butrenormalizableW ess-Zuminomodelswhose
vacua break the R-symmetry spontaneously while preserving the s upersymmetry. This
is because the genericity assumed in the Nelson-Seiberg theorem is s tronger than the
“genericity” in renormalizble Wess-Zumino models. In addition, it would be preferable if
we were able to know when the spontaneous breaking of the R-symm etry does or does
not occur before solving vacuum equations or F-term equations.
In a series of works [2][3][4][5][6][8][7][9][10][11][12][13] (see [14] for the most re cent
review), they have studied the revised conditions for the spontan eous breaking of super-
symmetry in “generic” but renormalizable Wess-Zumino models. The c entral question is
whenthe“generic”superpotential inrenormalizableWess-Zuminom odelscanberegarded
as a generic superpotential in the sense of the Nelson-Seiberg the orem. In particular, they
have given a suﬃcient condition for the existence of “generic” but r enormalizable Wess-
Zumino models whose vacua break the R-symmetry spontaneously w hile preserving the
supersymmetry. The condition turns out to be not necessary bec ause they ﬁnd another
exceptional casein[12]andwewill showmoresuch examples inthispap erwithsystematic
approaches to generate them.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we review th e Nelson-Seiberg
theorem and its generalizations. In section 3, we give new examples o f renormalizable
1exceptions to the Nelson-Seiberg theorem. In section 4, we conclu de the paper with some
discussions.
2 Spontaneoussupersymmetrybreakingin renormal-
izable Wess-Zumino models
Inthispaper, westudy Wess-Zumino modelswithholomorphicsuperp otentialW(Φi). We
assume that the K¨ ahler potential is everywhere regular, and the condition for the exis-
tence of the supersymmetric vacua is given by solving the F-term eq uations∂ΦiW= 0 for
all chiral superﬁelds Φi. In this paper, we state that the supersymmetry is spontaneous ly
broken when there is no solution to the F-term equations, and we will not commit our-
selves to the study of the potential, which requires the knowledge o f the eﬀective K¨ ahler
potential.
Let us ﬁrst review the Nelson-Seiberg theorem [1]. It dictates cond itions for the
spontaneousbreakingofthesupersymmetryinWess-Zuminomode lswithgeneric, possibly
non-renormalizable, superpotential; the existence of the R-symm etry is necessary while
the spontaneous breaking of the R-symmetry is suﬃcient. The Nels on-Seiberg theorem
itself, however, does not tell if the R-symmetry is spontaneously b roken or not.
Let us now restrict ourselves to renormalizable Wess-Zumino models , whose superpo-
tential is up to cubic. In [10] (called “theorem 5” in [14]), it was shown t hat in renor-
malizable Wess-Zumino models, R-symmetry is necessary for the spo ntaneous breaking of
supersymmetry. Furthermore, with the existence of the R-symm etry, it was shown that it
is necessary to have N2> N0, whereN2is a number of chiral superﬁelds whose R-charge
is two, and N0is a number of chiral superﬁelds whose R-charge is zero. It means t hat it
is suﬃcient to have N2≤N0to guarantee vacua with R-symmetry and supersymmetry
both preserved.
The importance of the R-charge two chiral superﬁelds comes from the fact that it can
appear linearly in the superpotential. Without the linear term in the su perpotential, one
can easily convince ourselves that there is always a supersymmetric vacuum at the origin
of the ﬁeld space in renormalizable Wess-Zumino models.
The existence of the R-charge zero superﬁelds, then eﬀectively r emoves the linear
term in the superpotential by acquiring the vacuum expectation va lues. This intuitively
2explains why the comparison between N2andN0is important.
These cases are consistent with the Nelson-Seiberg theorem. Thu s exceptions exist
only when N2> N0. We can argue that ifthe genericity assumption of the Nelson-Seiberg
theorem had applied here, we would obtain vacua with R-symmetry an d supersymmetry
both broken [5] (called “theorem 2” in [14]), and in many examples, it is in deed the case.
For example, the simplest O’Raifeartaigh model [15]
W=X(1+˜P˜Q)+˜QA+˜P2. (1)
with R-charge assignment R({X,˜P,˜Q,A}) ={2,1,−1,3}hasN2= 1 andN0= 0, and it
breaks both R-symmetry and supersymmetry spontaneously.
However, the genericity assumption in the sense of the Nelson-Seib erg theorem can
be violated in “generic” renormalizable Wess-Zumino models. At this po int, we should
emphasize again that the meaning of “genericity” in the renormalizab le Wess-Zumino
model is that we include all the renormalizable terms (i.e. terms up to c ubic) that are
consistent with the R-symmetry, and this does not guarantee the genericity assumption
made in the proof of the Nelson-Seiberg theorem.
In the proof of the Nelon-Seiberg theorem, we introduce the R-ch arge two (composite)
chiral superﬁeld xand R-charge zero (composite) chiral superﬁelds yato rewrite the
superpotential as W=xf(ya). Under the assumption that xhas a vacuum expectation
value, theF-termconditionbecomes f= 0and∂yaf= 0, but we have onemore constraint
than variables, so we do not expect a solution for a generic holomorp hic function f. In the
renormalizableexceptionsthatwewilldiscussbelow, weeﬀectively ha venoconstantterms
and no linear terms in f, which is regarded as a violation of the genericity assumption in
the sense of the Nelson-Seiberg theorem and enables us to solve th e F-term condition by
settingya= 0.
In [13], the brute force investigation has been performed with up to ﬁve chiral su-
perﬁelds. The result seems to suggest that order ten percent of “generic” renormalizable
Wess-Zumino models with N2> N0are exceptions and possess vacua with the sponta-
neous breaking of R-symmetry while supersymmetry is preserved.1One of the simplest
1We should emphasize that we do not know how the ratio scales when we increase the number of su-
perﬁelds. Intuitively, the number of R-symmetric Wess-Zumino mod els and the supersymmetry breaking
models show factorial growth (the latter having one smaller argume nt) and the ratio tends to zero.
3examples is the Wess-Zumino model whose superpotential is
W=X(1+PQ)+X2A+PA2. (2)
The R-chargeassignment is R({X,P,Q,A }) ={2,6,−6,−2}. The moduli space ofvacua
is given by a complex hyperbola PQ=−1. The R-symmetry is spontaneously broken
while the supersymmetry is preserved.
To explain such exceptions, they came up with a suﬃcient condition fo r vacua with
R-symmetry and supersymmetry preserved in models with N2> N0[9]. In [14] it is called
“theorem 4”.
LetNPQbe a number of independent products of chiral superﬁelds PandQthat have
opposite (non-zero) R-charges. For the existence of R-symmet ry breaking but supersym-
metry preserving vacua, it is suﬃcient that N0< N2≤N0+NPQ. When we count NPQ,
P, andQshould not have any mass terms and they should appear only linearly in cubic
terms in the superpotential.
In the above example (2), we have N2= 1,NPQ= 1,N0= 0, so the theorem applies
while in (1), we have N2= 1,NPQ= 0,N0= 0, and this theorem does not apply.
Note that in the latter case, although we have superﬁelds ˜Pand˜Qthat have an opposite
R-charge, they appear in the quadratic terms, so we do not count them inNPQ.
Is this condition necessary? In [12] they foundone example withnine chiral superﬁelds
which does not satisfy the requirement but shows spontaneous R- symmetry breaking with
the preserved supersymmetry. See example (3-0) in the next sec tion. In the rest of the
paper, we are going to show more examples of this sort with fewer ch iral superﬁelds.
Along the way, we will clarify the origin of such examples.
The reason why we imposed the condition “When we count NPQ,P, andQshould
not have any mass terms and they should appear only linearly in cubic t erms in the
superpotential.” is that otherwise, typically, the moduli space of R- symmetry breaking
vacua (such as PQ=−1 above) is lifted. Obviously, if the mass term demands P= 0 or
Q= 0, it is not compatible with PQ=−1. In the next section, we will critically address
what we mean by “typically” here.
43 New examples
A strategy to ﬁnd exceptions to the Nelson-Seiberg theorem is to a dd terms in the su-
perpotential which violate the assumption, but at the same time, we combine the added
terms with a new massless chiral superﬁeld, which will be called Bin the following, and
absorb the eﬀect of the superpotential. In other words, we exte nd the moduli space of
PQ=−1 inC2to a complex curve in C2+NB.
The following examples are listed in increasing order of NB. The coeﬃcients in the
superpotential must be generic, but for the purpose of simplicity o f presentation, we have
set them to be unity. More details for ﬁnding these examples can be f ound in the Master’s
thesis of the second author [16].
(example 1-1)
The superpotential is given by
W=X(1+˜P˜Q)+A(˜P+˜QB)+X2A (3)
with the R-charge assignment R({X,˜P,˜Q,A,B}) ={2,4,−4,−2,8}. The moduli space
is a complex curve: ˜P˜Q=−1,B˜Q=−˜P. In this model, N2= 1,N0= 0,NPQ= 0
and it does notsatisfy the condition N0< N2≤N0+NPQ, but the R-symmetry is
spontaneously broken with the supersymmetry preserved. We st ress that ˜Pand˜Qhave
an opposite R-charge, but we do not count in NPQbecause ˜Pappears in the quadratic
term. This is the reason why we put tilde here.
(example 1-2)
The superpotential is given by
W=X(1+˜P˜Q)+A(˜P+˜QB)+A3(4)

a complex curve: ˜P˜Q=−1,B˜Q=−˜P. The R-symmetry is spontaneously broken, but
supersymmetry is preserved.
These two examples have only ﬁve chiral superﬁelds so they must be on the list of
[13]. We believe there are no further exceptions in the list of [13], and t he classiﬁcation
is now complete.

moduli space is a complex curve: ˜P˜Q=−1,˜QB=−˜P. Note that in this model A1and
A3have an opposite R-charge, so one may want to call them ˜Q′and˜P′. Since they have
a quadratic superpotential, we still have NPQ= 0 anyway.

A comment about these new examples is in order. One may expect tha t adding
non-renormalizable terms in the superpotential makes them compa tible with the Nelson-
Seiberg theorem. Interestingly, it is not always the case. Take exa mple 1-1. One can
see that adding polynomial non-renormalizable superpotential does not remove the R-
symmetry breaking but the supersymmetry preserved vacuum th at we obtained.
To see this structure, consider introducing the R-charge two (co mposite) chiral super-
ﬁeldp=˜P1
2andR-chargezero(composite)chiralsuperﬁelds {x,q,a,b}={X
˜P1
2,˜Q˜P,A˜P1
2,B
˜P2}.
The superpotential becomes W=p(x+xq+a+qba+ax2), and it does not satisfy the
genericity assumptions of the Nelson-Seiberg theorem. If we relax the renormalizability
but still assume the polynomial superpotential in the original variab le, the superpotential
must be a polynomial W=pf(x,q,a,b) but it is a special form: since ˜Pmust appear in
a non-negative integer power, each term of fmust accompany at least one xora. This
means that it is not a generic superpotential in the sense of the Nels on-Seiberg theorem
because, without a constant term, x=a= 0 can solve the F-term condition.
4 Discussion
Inthispaper, wehavefoundnewexamplesofWess-Zuminomodelsth atcanberegardedas
exceptions to the Nelson-Seiberg theorem, which is not covered in t he classiﬁcation given
intheliterature. Theyﬁrstappearwhenthenumberofchiralsupe rﬁeldsisﬁve. According
to [13], with ﬁve chiral superﬁelds, there exist 759 renormalizable We ss-Zumino models
with the R-symmetry, among which 740 are compatible with the Nelson -Seiberg theorem.
The remaining 19 are exceptions to the Nelson-Seiberg theorem and most of them are
covered by the suﬃcient condition of [9].2We showed that there exist 2 renormalizable
Wess-Zumino models that are not covered.
As we reviewed in section 2, when N2≤N0, the “generic” renormalizable Wess-
Zumino models always have a vacuum with R-symmetry and supersymm etry preserved.
By using a similar technique to the one used in section 3, however, we c an obtain more
subtle examples that may be regarded as an exception to the Nelson -Seiberg theorem.
2These numbers are updated in the newer version of [13], which takes account of our ﬁndings. We
refer to the appendix of [13] for the complete list.
8In these examples, in addition to an R-symmetry preserving vacuum , we also ﬁnd vacua
where R-symmetry is spontaneously broken while supersymmetry is preserved.3
Let us present one such example. The superpotential is given by
W=X(1+Y+Y2+˜P˜Q)+A(1+Y)˜P+X2A (15)
with the R-charge assignment R({X,Y,˜P,˜Q,A}) ={2,0,4,−4,−2}. In addition to an
R-symmetric and supersymmetry preserving vacuum ˜P=˜Q= 0,Y=−1±√
3i
2, it has a
moduli space of vacua, where R-symmetry is spontaneously broke n but supersymmetry
is preserved: Y=−1,˜P˜Q=−1, and˜Q/ne}ationslash= 0,˜P= 0,Y=−1+√
3i
2. The latter branch can
be regarded as an exception to the Nelson-Seiberg theorem (i.e. th e suﬃciency condi-
tion of the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking) because the “ generic” renormalizable
superpotential here is not generic in the sense of the Nelson-Seibe rg theorem. More such
examples can be found in the Master’s thesis of the second author [1 6].
Including our examples, we have explained all the exceptions to the N elson-Seiberg
theorem in the renormalizable Wess-Zumino models up to ﬁve chiral su perﬁelds. Our
technique to generate new examples is more or less systematic but s till involves manual
checks to see if the “unwanted” superpotential terms, which will s tabilizeB, are compat-
ible with the R-symmetry or not. We believe that our ﬁndings give an imp ortant clue to
establish the “necessary condition” for the R-symmetry broken b ut supersymmetry pre-
served vacua in renormalizbale Wess-Zumino models. The establishme nt of the necessary
condition means that we have the sought-after criterion to ﬁnd sp ontaneous breaking of
the supersymmetry without solving the F-term equations.
