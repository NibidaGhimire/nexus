Abstract. We consider totally decomposable families of abelian Galoi s coverings, i.e. such that the
Jacobian of the general element is isogenous to a product of e lliptic curves. We characterize when they
yield a special subvariety of Ag.
1.Introduction
1.1. Let Agbe the moduli space of principally polarized abelian variet ies of dimension goverC. The
specialsubvarieties of Agare deﬁned as Hodge loci for the natural variation of Hodge st ructure over
QonAg, whose ﬁber over AisH1(A,Q). The moduli space Agis the quotient of the Siegel space
Sgby the action of Sp(2 g,Z). We denote by π:Sg→ Agthe natural projection map. An algebraic
subvariety Z⊂ Agistotally geodesic ifZ=π(X) for some (connected) totally geodesic submanifold
X⊂Sg. We say that Xis the symmetric space uniformizing Z. Special subvarieties of Agare totally
geodesic. Moreover, a totally geodesic subvariety ZofAgis special if and only if it contains a complex
multilplication (CM) point ([25, 22]). Let Mgdenote the moduli space of smooth, complex algebraic
curves of genus gand consider the Torelli map j:Mg→ Ag. By the Torelli theorem, the map jis
injective. There is the following well known conjecture:
Conjecture 1 (Coleman-Oort) .Forg >>0, there are no positive dimensional special subvarieties Z
ofAgsuch that Z⊂j(Mg) andZ∩j(Mg)/ne}ationslash=∅.
1.2. For low genus there exist counterexamples to the Coleman-Oort conjecture, i.e. there exist exam-
ples of (positive-dimensional) special subvarieties ZofAgsuch that Z⊂j(Mg) andZ∩j(Mg)/ne}ationslash=∅.
These have been object of study of many authors, we mention e. g. [5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16, 21, 23, 24, 29].
All the counterexamples known so far are in genus g≤7 and are obtained via families of Galois covers
of curves. The idea of the main construction is the following . LetGbe a ﬁnite group and let C →B
be the family of all Galois covers Ct→C′
t=Ct/G, where the genera g=g(Ct),g′=g(C′
t), the
ramiﬁcation and the monodromy are ﬁxed. Let Mbe the image in MgofBand letZ:=j(M). In
[23] in the case g′= 0 and Gcyclic and in [9, 11] for any Gandg′, it is proven that if the numerical
condition
dimH0(C,2KC)G= dim(S2H0(C,KC))G(⋆)
holds true for a general [ C]∈M, thenZis a special subvariety of Ag. Clearly, Zlies in the Torelli
locus and meets the open Torelli locus non-trivially. Thus, under the condition ( ⋆),Zprovides a
counterexample to the conjecture.
1.3. It is a natural problem to understand whether ( ⋆) is also necessary for a family of G-covers to
yield a special variety. We brieﬂy recall what is known about this problem. In [23] Moonen proved
the necessity of condition ( ⋆) wheng′= 0 and the group Gis cyclic. His proof relies on deep results
in positive characteristics. Making use of similar techniq ues, Mohajer and Zuo [21] extended this to
2020 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation . 14H10, 14H40, 14G35, 14K05.

the case where g′= 0, the group Gis abelian and the family is one-dimensional. Finally, stil l using
the reduction modulo ptechnique, Mohajer proved in [20] the necessity of ( ⋆) forg′= 0,Gabelian,
plus some extra condition on the monodromy of the family. A Ho dge theoretic argument is given in
[4, Prop. 5.7]. Here, Colombo, Frediani, and Ghigi prove tha t (⋆) is necessary for Zto be totally
geodesic in the case g′= 0,Gcyclic, plus another condition on the dimension of the eigen spaces for
the representation of GonH0(C,KC). In [8], Frediani generalized this result to the case g′= 0 and
Gabelian with the analogue condition on the eigenspaces.
1.4. In this work, we consider the case where Gis abelian and the Jacobian of the general element of
the family is totally decomposable, i.e. it is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves. This is a natural
case to study, as the group algebra decomposition of many of t he counterexamples produces totally
decomposable Jacobians. For a detailed study see [28, Propo sition 3.1.6]. We prove the following
Main Theorem. If the family is totally decomposable and Gis abelian, then Zis special if and only
if(⋆)holds.
We stress that, by results of Mohajer and Zuo, the necessity o f (⋆) was already known in the abelian
case for one-dimensional families with g′= 0. Our result allows to take into account totally decompos-
able abelian families of any dimension and any g′≥0. Also, note that families of totally decomposable
abelianG-covers do not fall within the aforementioned cases already discussed by Mohajer [20] and
Frediani [8]. Hence our result goes in the direction of compl eting the proof of the necessity of ( ⋆) in
the abelian case.
The result ﬁts into a more general approach to the Coleman-Oo rt conjecture for totally decompos-
ablespecialsubvarieties. ThiswasﬁrstaddressedbyMoone nandOortin[24, Question6.6]. Moreover,
Lu and Zuo in [19] show that there do not exist special curves w hose generic point decomposes as Ek.
It has been proved in [5] that, for g≤100, the only families satisfying condition ( ⋆) are the ones
listed in [9, 11, 12]. Detecting which of those are totally de composable allows to state Corollary 4.12.
The work is organized as follows: in Section 2 we review the ba sics on families of G-curves. Section
3 is devoted to the description of the generic Hodge group of a family in the abelian case. In Section
4 we consider families of totally decomposable abelian G-curves and prove our Theorem. Finally, in
Section 5 we comment on our result in relation with previous l iterature.

2.Families of G-curves
This section is devoted to recall basic facts and properties of families of Galois coverings: we ﬁrst
describe when they yield a special subvariety of Agand, secondly, we review how the action of the
group decomposes, up to isogeny, the Jacobians of the curves in the family.
2.1. Let Gbe a ﬁnite group and let C →Bbe the family of all Galois covers Ct→C′
t=Ct/G, where
the genera g=g(Ct),g′=g(C′
t), the ramiﬁcation and the monodromy are ﬁxed (see e.g. [15, 1 4]).
LetMbe the image in MgofBand letZ:=j(M). IfCtis one of the curves in the family, the action
ofGonCtinduces an action of Gon holomorphic one-forms:
ρ:G→GL(H0(Ct,KCt)), ρ(g)(ω) =g.ω:= (g−1)∗(ω). (2.1)
Notice that theequivalence class of ρdoes not dependon the point t∈B. Sinceit acts holomorphically
onCt,ρmapsGinjectively into Sp(2 g,R). In particular, Gis a group of isometries of Sgand, since
Gis ﬁnite, SG
gis non-empty. It follows that SG
gis a smooth connected totally geodesic submanifold
ofSg. The image S(G) ofSGinAgis a special subvariety of Agof PEL type (see [9, 11]). ByON TOTALLY DECOMPOSABLE ABELIAN G-CURVES AND SPECIAL SUBVARIETIES 3
construction, S(G) contains Z. The condition
dimZ= dimS(G), (⋆)
implies that Z=S(G) and hence it ensures that Zis special in Ag. In particular, it provides a
counterexample to the Coleman-Oort conjecture. The orbifo ld cotangent space of Minx= [Ct]
isH0(Ct,2KCt)G, while the orbifold cotangent space of S(G) atj(x) = [JCt] isT∗
j(x)(Sg)G=
(T∗
j(x)Sg)G= (S2H0(Ct,KCt))G. It follows that we can read condition ( ⋆) as:
dimH0(Ct,2KCt)G= dim(S2H0(Ct,KCt))G. (⋆)
2.2. Using condition ( ⋆), various couterexamples to the conjecture have been obtai ned. These are in
genusg≤7 and can be divided in two classes:
(1) those obtained as families of Galois covers satisfying ( ⋆);
(2) those obtained via ﬁbrations constructed on the example s in (1) with g′= 1 (see [12]).
It is proved in [12] that there are no families of Galois cover s of curves with g′≥2 satisfying ( ⋆).
Table 2 in [9] lists all known examples of type (1) with g′= 0. Table 2 in [11] lists all known examples
of type of type (1) with g′= 1. Actually, in [5], the authors show that the one listed in [ 9, 11] are
the only positive-dimensional families of Galois covering s satisfying ( ⋆) with 2 ≤g≤100. In [30] it
has been computed the symmetric space uniformizing each of t hese counterexamples. Of a diﬀerent
nature are the two examples in [29], obtained via non-Galois coverings.
2.3. Of course, the condition ( ⋆) is a priori just a suﬃcient condition: when dim Z<dimS(G) one
can’t conclude that Zis not special. It can happen that Zis a smaller special subvariety contained
inS(G). In the following we will denote by Sfthe smallest special subvariety containing Z. We thus
haveZ⊆Sf⊆S(G) andZis special if and only if Z=Sf. To prove the necessity of ( ⋆) means to
prove that Zis special if and only if Z=Sf=S(G).
2.4. The action of the ﬁnite group Gon the curve Cinduces an action of Gon the Jacobian variety
JC. We now explain how this action decomposes JCup to isogeny. We will refer to [18, 3, 27].
LetCbe aG-curve. Associated to the G-action there is a natural homomorphism σ:Q[G]→
EndQ(JC). Any element αinQ[G] corresponds to Xα:= Imσ(α), an abelian subvariety of JC.
Decomposing Q[G] =Q1× ··· ×Qras a product of simple Q-algebra Qi, we get 1 = e1+···+er.
This, together with the map ρ, yields the isotypical decomposition Xe1×...XerofJC. It is unique
up to permutation of the terms and the addition map induces an isogeny with JC. Note that the
termsXeiare stable subtori of JCwith Hom( Xei,Xej) = 0 for i/ne}ationslash=jand each of them corresponds
to a rational irreducible representation WiofG(see [18, Theorem 2.2]).
It is also known that the simple algebras Qican be decomposed into a product of minimal left
ideals (all isomorphic) and hence a further decomposition o fJCis determined. Let Vibe one of the
irreducible C-representations associated to Wiand letni:= dimVi/mi, wheremiis the Schur index
ofVi. Then there is a set {pi1,...,pini}of primitive idempotents such that ei=pi1+···+piniand
abelian subvarieties Yj:=Ypijyielding an isogeny

called the group algebra decomposition of JC. Note that this decomposition is not uniquely deter-
mined: it depends on the choice of the pij. WhenGis abelian, dim Vi= 1 for all Vi, henceni= 1. In
[27, Theorem 5.12], the author gives a way to compute the dime nsion of each piece Yiin terms of the
geometric signature of the covering C→C/G.
Remark 2.5. Some of the varieties Yi’s may be of dimension zero. For instance, the term Y1corre-
sponding to the trivial representation W1may be taken as the Jacobian of C/G, whose genus may be
equal to zero.4 IRENE SPELTA AND CAROLINA TAMBORINI
3.Hodge group and smallest special subvariety
In this section we give a summary of the known results about th e generic Hodge group of a family
of abelian G-curves.
3.1. Let Gbe a ﬁnite abelian group. As in 2.1, consider the family f:C →Bof all Galois covers
Cb→C′
b=Cb/Gwith ﬁxed genera g=g(Cb),g′=g(C′
b), ramiﬁcation and monodromy. Let
V=R1f∗Qbe the local system of the natural Q-VHS associated with the family, and b∈Bbe a
Hodge-generic point with respect to the variation V. TheQ-VHS comes equipped with a G−action.
LetX(G) denote the set of C-irreducible representations of G. We have the following decomposition
in sublocal systems
VC=⊕χ∈X(G)Vχ,
whereVχdenotes the χ-isotypical summand over C. At the the point b, we have that Vb=H1(Cb,Q).
This decomposes as H1(Cb,C) =⊕χ∈X(G)H1(Cb,C)χ=⊕χ∈X(G)mχVχ, whereVχis theC-irreducible
representation associated with χandmχits multiplicity. Note that Vχ,b=H1(Cb,C)χ=mχVχ.
Similarly, let X(G,R) denote the set of R-irreducible representations of G. Forχ∈X(G), we denote
by (χ,χ) the real representation associated with it. The analogue d ecomposition with real coeﬃcients
is:
VR=/circleplusdisplay
(χ,χ)∈X(G,R),V(χ,χ)
Where, if χ/ne}ationslash=χ, the relation is
V(χ,χ)⊗RC=Vχ⊕Vχ
while ifχ=χ, we have
V(χ,χ)⊗RC=Vχ.
Whenχ/ne}ationslash=χ, on the summand V(χ,χ), the polarization of the VHS induces an hermitian form of
signature ( mχ,mχ). In the case χ=χthe polarization induces a symplectic form on V(χ,χ)(see [6,
Corollary 2.21-2.23]).
Let Mon0⊂GL(H1(Cb,Q)) and Hg ⊂GL(H1(Cb,Q)) be the connected monodromy group and the
Hodge group, respectively. In particular, Hg is the generic Hodge group of the VHS. By Andr´ e [1,
Theorem 1], Mon0is a semi-simple normal subgroup of Hg. We have Mon0⊂Hg⊂Sp(H1(Cb,Q))G,
where Sp( H1(Cb,Q))Gis the centralizer of Gin Sp(H1(Cb,Q)). Extending scalars to Rthere are the
following isomorphisms:
Sp(H1(Cb,R))G≃/productdisplay
(χ,¯χ)∈X(G,R)Sp(H1(Cb,R)χ)G≃/productdisplay
(χ,¯χ),χ/negationslash=¯χU(mχ,m¯χ)×/productdisplay
(χ,¯χ),χ=¯χSp(2mχ,R). (3.1)
We denote by Mon0(χ) the projection of Mon0
Ronto the χ-factor of the decomposition. Mohajer and
Zuo (extending results in [23, 26]) proved the following:
Proposition 3.2. [21, Lemma 6.4] Ifmχm¯χ/ne}ationslash= 0, thenMon0(χ) = SU(mχ,m¯χ). Moreover, if χ= ¯χ,
thenSU(mχ,mχ) = Sp2mχ.
3.3. Similarly to (3.1), over Qwe have Sp( H1(Cb,Q))G≃/producttext
χ∈X(G,Q)Sp(H1(Cb,Q)χ)G. Again, the
Sp(H1(Cb,Q)χ)G’s are unitary groups (see [2, Section 2]). This decompositi on mirrors the isogeny
decomposition given by the group algebra decomposition des cribed in Section 2.4. As before, we
denote by Mon0(χ,Q) the projections over the various factors. For ρ∈X(G,Q), letχρ
ibe the real
irreducible representations associated with ρ. Then we have Mon0(ρ,Q)⊗R⊂/producttextMon0(χρ
i).
3.4. Let Sfbe the smallest special subvariety of Agthat contains Z. This is the special subvariety
associated withHg, i.e. it isthespecial subvariety whoseu niformizeristhesymmetricspace associatedON TOTALLY DECOMPOSABLE ABELIAN G-CURVES AND SPECIAL SUBVARIETIES 5
with the real group HgR. This follows from the general fact that special subvarieti es inAgare
uniformized by the symmetric space associated with the gene ric Hodge group (see [13, Section 3] for
a thorough survey). More details on this are also recalled in the following section (see Theorem 4.2).
Let Hgad
R=Q1× ··· ×Qsbe the decomposition of Hgad
RinR-simple groups. If Qiis non-compact
we denote by δ(Qi) the dimension of corresponding symmetric space. When Qiis compact we set
δ(Qi) = 0. Therefore dim Sf=/summationtextδ(Qi). Obviously, Zis special if and only if dim Z= dimSf.
3.5. As we previously observed, Mon0is a normal subgroup of Hg. By semi-simplicity it follows tha t

for some χ. Thus, we have
Mon0,ad
R= Hgad

SU(mχ2,m¯χ2). Note that dim S(G) =/summationtextδ(SU(mχ,m¯χ)) (see e.g. [21, Lemma 2.6]). Therefore
Z=Sf/subsetnoteqlS(G) if and only if dim Sf<dimS(G), hence if and only if Hgad
R/ne}ationslash=/producttext
mχm¯χ/negationslash=0SU(mχ,m¯χ).
Summing up, collecting results contained in [26, 23, 21], we get the following:
Proposition 3.6. LetZ=Sf. The generic Hodge group of the family has the following prope rties:
(1)Hgad
R=Q1×···×Qs, withQi= Mon0,ad(χ) =SU(mχ,m¯χ)for some χ;
(2)Hgad

Rcontains a subgroup isomorphically mapped to SU(mχ1,m¯χ1) =
SU(mχ2,m¯χ2).
4.Proof of the Main Theorem
In this section we consider families of totally decomposabl e abelian G-curves. We characterize their
generic Hodge group. Using this, together with results from section 3, we prove the main theorem.
Finally, we conclude with some considerations for the non-a belian cases.
4.1. Let Λ be a 2 grank lattice, Q: Λ×Λ→Za symplectic form of type (1 ,...,1), and set V:= ΛR.
We denote by S(V,Q) the Siegel space, which can be deﬁned as:
(4.1) S(V,Q) ={J∈GL(ΛR) :J2=−I, J∗Q=Q, Q(x,Jx)>0,∀x/ne}ationslash= 0}.
We consider on S(V,Q) the natural polarized integral variation of Hodge structu re, whose ﬁber over
J∈S(V,Q) isVCequipped with the tautological Hodge structure VC=V−1,0(J)⊕V0,−1(J). Since
this Hodge structure only depends on J, we denote it simply by J, and we let ρJ:S(R)→GL(VR) be
its associated representation, that is ρJ(z)v=zvforv∈V−1,0(J) andρJ(z)v=zvforv∈V0,−1(J).
We denote by Hg( J) the Hodge group associated with J. Note that Hg( J)⊂Sp(ΛQ,Q), sinceQis a6 IRENE SPELTA AND CAROLINA TAMBORINI
polarization for J. The tautological variation of Hodge structure on S(V,Q) descends to an (orbifold)
variation over Ag. We recall the following results (see e.g. [13, Lemma 4.5]):
Theorem 4.2. The orbit Hg(J)R.J⊂S(V,Q)is a complex totally geodesic submanifold of S(V,Q).
With the induced metric, it is a Hermitian symmetric space of the non-compact type. Moreover,
assume that Z⊂ Agis a special subvariety and that x∈Zis general. Then for J∈S(V,Q)with
π(J) =x, we have Z=π(Hg(J)R.J).
4.3. The proof of the Main Theorem is based on the following Pr opositions. In the case of elliptic
curves, we have:
Proposition 4.4. LetEbe an elliptic curve and J∈S1such that π(J) = [E]∈ A1. Then:
(1) ifEhas CM, then Hg(J)R.J=J, i.e. it is a point in S1;
(2) otherwise Hg(J)R.J=S1.
Proof.Remember that an elliptic curve Ehas complex multiplication when End( E)⊗ZQis a complex
multiplication ﬁeld, i.e. it is a totally imaginary quadrat ic extension of a totally real number ﬁeld.
This happens if and only if End Q(E)/supersetornotdbleql Q. Equivalently, if J∈S1is as in the statement, Ehas
complex multiplication if and only if Hg( J) is a torus algebraic group ([25, Section 2]). This happens
if and only if Hg( J)/subsetnoteqlSp(ΛQ,Q). Hence, if Ehas CM, then Hg( J)Ris the algebraic torus C∗, while
forEgeneral Hg( J)R= Sp(2,R). It follows that the orbits are as claimed. /square
Notice that for n≥1 one can identify Hg( En) with Hg( E), acting diagonally on Λn
Q. In the case of a
totally decomposable abelian variety we have the following result by Imai [17].
Proposition 4.5. LetE1,...,Enbe elliptic curves, no two of which are isogenous. Then we have that
Hg(Ek1
1×···×Eknn) = Hg(E1)×···×Hg(En).
4.6. Let Gbe a ﬁnite group. Consider the family f:C →Bof all Galois covers Ct→C′
t=Ct/G
with ﬁxed genera g=g(Ct),g′=g(C′
t), ramiﬁcation and monodromy. As in 2.1, we denote by Zthe
associated subvariety of Ag. In the following, we suppose that f:C →Bhas the following properties:
(1)Zis a special subvariety of Ag;
(2)Zis totally decomposable, i.e. for x= [JC]∈Zgeneric, we have JC∼Ek1
1×···×Eknn.
SinceZis special, it will contain a dense set of CM points (see [25]) . Lety∈Zbe one of them. By
deﬁnition, the curves E1,...,Enat the point yhave CM. It follows that, if Eiis not varying in the
family, then Eimust have CM. Thus, up to reordering, the generic point JCin the family looks like

thatπ(τi) = [¯Ei]∈ A1. We have the following:

Hence the orbit is given by Hg( JC)R.JC= Hg(E1)R.E1×···×Hg(Er)R.Er×Hg(¯Er+1)R.¯Er+1×···×
Hg(¯En)R.¯En. By Proposition 4.4 we conclude. /square
4.8. When Gis abelian, Proposition 3.6, (1) and Proposition 4.7 provid e two characterizations of the
generic Hodge group of the family f:C →B. Now we compare them.ON TOTALLY DECOMPOSABLE ABELIAN G-CURVES AND SPECIAL SUBVARIETIES 7
As recalled in section 3.5, when Zis special, by Andr´ e’s theorem we have that Mon0= Hgder, where
Hg is the generic Hodge group of the family. By Proposition 4. 5, we get Mon0= Hgder= Hg(E1)der×
···×Hg(Er)der×Hg(¯Er+1)der×···×Hg(¯En)der. Hence Mon0= Hgder= Hg(E1)der×···×Hg(Er)der.
It follows that Mon0,ad
R= Hgder,ad
R= Hg(E1)ad
R× ··· ×Hg(Er)ad
R. This is the decomposition in
Proposition 4.7. Comparing with the decomposition in Propo sition 3.6, (1), we conclude that Qi=
Sp(2,R) = SU(1 ,1). More precisely, the Hodge group Hg( Ei)ad
Rof each moving elliptic curve Eiis one
of the Mon0,ad(χ)’s appearing in Proposition 3.6, (1). We will call it Mon0,ad(χi), namely we denote
byχithe eigenspace corresponding to the moving elliptic curve Ei.
The representation χiwill contribute to the Galois orbit of some Q-irreducible representation ρ.
We stress this with the notations χρ

i. Thus we have:
Proposition 4.9. WhenGis abelian, the two decompositions of the generic Hodge grou p given in
Proposition 3.6, (1) and in Proposition 4.7 coincide. In part icular,r=sandHgad

Proof of the main theorem. Suppose by contradiction that ( ⋆) does not hold, i.e. Z=Sf/subsetnoteqlS(G).
Then it follows from Proposition 3.6, (3), that there exists χr+1such that
Hg(JC)ad
R= Mon0,ad(χ1)×···×Mon0,ad(χr)/subsetnoteqlMon0,ad(χ1)×···×Mon0,ad(χr)×Mon0,ad(χr+1)×...,
with Mon0,ad(χr+1)/ne}ationslash={1}. The eigenspace χr+1will contribute to the Galois orbit of some Q-
irreduciblerepresentation ρr+1. Hence, Mon0(ρr+1)/ne}ationslash={1}. But, by Proposition4.11 this isimpossible.
Indeed, for all ρ∈X(G,Q) with Mon0(ρ)/ne}ationslash={1}, we have that Mon0(ρ,Q)⊗Ralready contributes to
Hg(JC)ad
R. In other words, Mon0(ρr+1)/ne}ationslash={1}requires the existence of an extra moving factor in the
group algebra decomposition. And this is impossible. /square
As observed in 2.2, the only counterexamples satisfying ( ⋆) forg≤100 are the one listed in [9, 11].
With the notations therein, our theorem implies:8 IRENE SPELTA AND CAROLINA TAMBORINI
Corollary 4.12. For genus g≤100the only totally decomposable special subvarieties of Agassociated
with families of abelian Galois coverings are:
•(3) = (5) ,(4),(26) = (1 e)ing= 2;
•(7) = (23) ,(22),(3e),(4e),(27)ing= 3;
•(13) = (24) ,(25)ing= 4.
Proof.It follows from the analysis done in [28, Proposition 3.1.6] . /square
4.13. We conclude with some observations regarding the non- abelian case. Here Proposition 3.2 does
not hold and hence the monodromy groups are not well characte rized. Also the PEL subvariety S(G)
is more diﬃcult to describe. In the totally decomposable cas e, we can at least conclude the following.
Proposition 4.14. LetZbe a totally decomposable subvariety. If mχm¯χ/ne}ationslash= 0, thenMon0(χ)is
isomorphic to SU(1,1)or a product of SU(1,1).
Proof.By Propositions 4.4 and 4.5, Hgad
Ris a product of Qi=SU(1,1). As in 3.5, we have that/producttextQi⊆/producttext
χMon0,ad(χ). By deﬁnition, Mon0,ad(χ) is at least semisimple, since Hgad
Rsurjects onto it.
Thus we can write it as product of simple factors Mon0,ad(χ) =/producttextFj. AsQiis normal in Hgad
R, its
projection is normal as well. Hence we get Qi=SU(1,1) =Fj. /square
5.Comparison with previous results
As explained in the Introduction §1.3, the condition ( ⋆) has been considered by various authors and,
in the case of families of abelian coverings of the line, ther e are some results that prove its necessity
under extra conditions on the eigenspaces of the family. In t he following we collect what is known
about abelian G-coverings of the line and comment on our result in relation w ith them.
5.1. Let us start by recalling what is already known about the necessity of ( ⋆) in the case of abelian
coverings of the line.
Theorem 5.2 (Mohajer and Zuo, Theorem 6.2 [21]) .Letf:C →Bbe a one-dimensional family of
abelian coverings of the line. Then Z⊂ Agis special if and only if (⋆)holds.
Theorem 5.3 (Mohajer, Theorem 5.2 [20]) .Letf:C →Bbe ar−dimensional family of abelian
coverings of the line. If there exists χ∈X(G)such that {mχ,m¯χ} /ne}ationslash={0,r+1}andmχ+m¯χ≥r+1,
thenZ⊂ Agis special if and only if (⋆)holds.
Theorem 5.4 (Frediani, Theorem 3.1 [8]) .Letf:C →Bbe a family of abelian coverings of the line.
If
(1) either there exists χ∈X(G)withχ/ne}ationslash= ¯χsuch that mχ≥2andm¯χ≥2;
(2) or there exists χ∈X(G)withχ= ¯χsuch that mχ≥3,
then(⋆)does not hold and Zis not totally geodesic (hence it is not special).
To compare our result with the above ones, we consider now the case where our family f:C →Bof
totally decomposable abelian G-curves is a such that g′= 0, i.e. it is a family of Galois covering of the
line. When Zis special, it follows by Proposition 4.9 that, for χ∈X(G), we either have mχm¯χ= 0,
ormχ=m¯χ= 1. Hence, obviously, the conditions in Theorem 5.4 are not s atisﬁed. Moreover, when
r= dimZ≥2, the condition on the eigenspaces in Theorem 5.3 is never sa tisﬁed. Hence the case of
totally decomposable abelian G-covers does not fall within the already studied cases. We gu ess that
our main Theorem goes in the direction of completing the proo f of the necessity of ( ⋆) in the abelian
case.
