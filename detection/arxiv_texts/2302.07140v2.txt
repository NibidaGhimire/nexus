The Talbot-Plateau law asserts that when the flux (light energy) of a flicker-fused 
stimulus equals the flux of a steady stimulus, they will appear equal in brightness. 
To be  perceived as flicker-fused, the frequency of the flash sequence must 
be high enough that no flicker is perceived, i.e., it appears to be a steady stimulus. 
Generally, this law has been accepted as being true across all brightness levels, 
and across all combinations of flash duration and frequency that generate the 
matching flux level. Two experiments that were conducted to test the law found 
significant departures from its predictions, but these were small relative to the 
large range of flash intensities that were tested.

Introduction
When a certain place in the retina is stimulated always in the same way by regular periodic 
impulses of light, then, provided each recurrent stimulus is sufficiently short lived, the result is a 
continuous impression, equivalent to what would be produced if the light acting during each period 
were uniformly distributed over the entire time  (Von Helmholtz, 1910 , V2, p. 207).
In the quote above, Von Helmholtz (1910)  is referring to a principle first articulated in the 
mid-1800s, which is now known as the Talbot-Plateau law. It is a rather remarkable claim about 
how brief, successive, light flashes will combine to determine the net perceived brightness of a 
given stimulus. As an initial requirement, the flash frequency must be sufficiently high to 
be perceived as steady/fused meaning that one does not perceive any flicker in the stimulus 
source. The Talbot-Plateau law asserts that the perceived brightness of a flicker-fused stimulus 
will be equal to the brightness of a steady stimulus when the average intensity of the two are 
equal. Stated differently, both stimuli must be delivering the same amount of light energy per 
unit time. Talbot’s initial analysis began with the concept of visual persistence, which had been 
noted by Newton a century earlier ( Newton, 1704 ; Talbot, 1834 ). Newton was discussing the 
streak of light that one can perceive from the motion of a glowing ember. He proposed that one 
could measure the duration of visible persistence by attaching the glowing ember to a spinning 
wheel and measuring the time it takes for the trailing streak to form a complete circle. Talbot 
continued the analysis as follows:
The question deserves consideration whether the eye receives from this circular ring exactly the same 
quantity of light which it received from the much smaller surface of the coal at rest… If, then, the 
total quantity of light remains the same, it follows that its apparent intensity must have diminished 
in exactly the same proportion as its apparent area has been enlarged [spread around the perimeter]  
(Talbot, 1834 , p. 328).OPEN ACCESS

Frontiers in Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.orgTalbot was asserting that the total light energy from an ember 
trace that has completed a full circle will be the same as the total 
energy from a steady ember across the same time interval. That energy 
is being spread across the black background of space, thus providing 
the streak. He  further inferred that within a single period of a 
flickering light, the energy of the flash could fill the interval of 
darkness that follows.
The perceptual effect of light stimulation was a major topic of 
interest to physicists throughout the 1800s. One could spin a disk that 
had some sectors painted white and others painted black and note the 
speed of rotation at which the succession of black and white would 
blend and be perceived as solid gray. The relative areas of black and 
white would determine the shade of gray. Talbot’s further inference 
was that the shade of gray would appear the same as a gray zone being 
illuminated by a steady source that provided the same quantity of light 
energy. Plateau (1830)  had reached the same conclusion a few 
years before.
But this inference cried out for supporting evidence. Talbot 
provided this by comparing the perceived brightness of a disk that was 
illuminated with intermittent flashes to another disk providing steady 
light. Brightness of the steady source was controlled by two polarizing 
filters, these being wafers of calcite (spar) that came to be known as 
Nicols filters. The filters would transmit light when the polarizing 
orientations were aligned the same, and would block progressively 
more light as they were rotated into misalignment. Adjusting the 
relative orientation of the filters provided a way to quantify the 
amount of light being passed, and Talbot reported that the brightness 
of the flicker-fused stimulus matched the brightness of the steady 
source when the two delivered the same amount of light energy.
Talbot (1834)  also briefly described experiments based on creating 
flash sequences with a spinning mirror that reflected a beam of 
sunlight. Intensity of the steady source was controlled by adjusting the 
aperture through which the beam passed. His experiments were 
suggestive, if not experimentally rigorous, but Stewart (1888)  claimed 
support for Talbot’s law with experiments that used the mirror 
method. For this, a light beam was bounced off a spinning mirror and 
by further reflection was carried into the eye of the observer. With 
each rotation a beam from the lamp would pass across the eye and 
be seen as a flash. The mirror revolved at a rate that assured fusion of 
the flashes, so the image appeared to be  steady. For the steady 
comparison, the beam from a second source was reflected off a 
stationary mirror and then brought to a location that was adjacent to 
the flicker-fused stimulus. The intensity of the light was determined 
using the inverse square of distance. A given rotation speed would 
change the duration of flashes and simultaneously alter the frequency, 
providing compensation for total energy, as required by the Talbot-
Plateau law. Stewart claimed to find support for that concept at all 
rotation speeds, even with flash durations as low as 1.2 × 10−7 s 
(120 nanoseconds).
Fick (1863)  said that the law did not hold when the stimulus was 
very bright or very dark, but most investigators during this period 
embraced the claim that the visual system was making precise 
assessment of light energy at all stimulus intensities. The Talbot-
Plateau predictions were generally accepted as being true whether one 
was comparing bright or dim stimuli. It was generally accepted as 
being true whatever the ratio of light and dark intervals in the flash 
sequence, which is commonly known as “duty cycle. ” Von Helmholtz 
(1910)  supported the concept, as reflected in the quote provided at the outset. He  did so even though there were numerous reasons for 
doubting that it could be  valid as an overarching principle. Von 
Helmholtz (1910) , p. 180 noted that bright objects appear brighter in 
dim illumination, and cited examples of enhanced brightness when 
the frequency of stimulation was below the fusion threshold. He cited 
Purkinje that colors manifest differential brightness as a function of 
ambient illumination ( Von Helmholtz, 1891 ), which he  correctly 
attributed to the differential activation of rods and cones.
There were other findings that should have counseled caution 
about assuming a simple and precise mechanism for generating 
brightness perception. As one spins a disk painted with black and 
white sectors, at some disk speeds one sees brilliant colors, these being 
known as Benham or Fechner colors (see Bagley, 1902 ). Helmholtz 
dedicated a substantial amount of attention to the pulsed conditions 
that yield perception of colors. It was clear that the mechanisms for 
color and brightness were interconnected in some manner, and it was 
(and is) far from obvious how these interactions might bear on the 
production of brightness, per se .
In addition, Gestalt theorists rejected the concept that the 
perception of brightness was precisely tied to the quantity of light 
being delivered by the stimulus. A small sampling of the insights 
provided by the Gestalt School can be found in Ellis (1938) , who 
translated papers by Fuchs, Benary, and Gelb. Fuch (pp 95–103) 
reviewed assimilation of colors, including the factors influencing 
the perception of white, citing Wundt as an early source of insight 
about brightness assimilation. He also mentions the presence of 
brightness-suppressing ghosts at the intersections of Hering squares 
(also commonly known as a Herman grid). Benary (pp 104–108) 
described brightness contrast that can be produced by placing the 
stimulus to be judged adjacent to various forms. Gelb (pp 196–209) 
provided examples of color and brightness constancy. Many of these 
phenomena had been noted by 19th century investigators, so there 
were already ample reasons to doubt that the perception of 
brightness would be  based only on the quantity of light 
being received.
We could now add the late Gestalt contribution of Kanizsa (1979)  
who demonstrated that shapes implied by collinear lines and line 
terminations appear brighter than background. We see differential 
brightness of zones lying in shadow ( Gilchrist, 1994 ), and the Craik-
O’Brien-Cornsweet illusion continues to give pause ( Cornsweet, 
1970 ). All in all, it strains credulity that the visual system would 
be subject to so many sources of spatial and temporal influence and 
yet the mechanism for integrating successive flashes would precisely 
register the net light energy being delivered.
Notwithstanding the reasons for doubt, there were a number of 
claims of support from experiments done in the early 1900s. 
Sherrington (1902 , 1904)  tested the Talbot-Plateau principle using 
monoptic and dichoptic stimulation from beams passing through 
holes in rotating cylinders. Unfortunately, his description of method 
was insufficient to provide assurance that the brightness of the flicker-
fused stimulus matched that provided by the steady light source.
Hyde (1906)  used a rotating disk with open sectors that could 
chop a beam of light and thus produce flash sequences. He had special 
concern about the ability to quantify the amount of light being emitted 
from the source, given that the inverse square law is valid only if one 
has a point source. His illumination was from the element of a Nernst 
glow lamp with the diffusion globe removed, and extensive 
calculations were applied to correct for the fact that it was elongated Greene and Morrison 10.3389/fnins.2023.1169162
Frontiers in Neuroscience 03 frontiersin.organd not a proper point source. He provided extensive data in support 
of the Talbot-Plateau law with various rotation speeds and open-
sector ratios.
Beams (1935)  provided a brief report claiming confirmation of the 
Talbot-Plateau law using a rotating-mirror for generating flash 
sequences and Nicols polarizing filters to control the intensity of the 
steady stimulus. He provided minimal details about experimental 
methods, and did not report any data other than saying that the 
principle was supported for flash durations ranging from 10−6 to 10−8. 
Gilmer (1937)  conducted two experiments, one that produced flash 
sequences with a rotating mirror and the other with a rotating disk. 
Intensity of the steady source was adjusted using Nicols filters. 
He reported support for the Talbot-Plateau law for flash durations 
ranging from 10−2 down to 8 × 10−9 s. Brightness was evaluated across 
the range from 5 to 50 candles/m2.
Bartley (1937 , 1938a , 1939) , equated the brightness of flicker-
fused and steady stimuli, mostly to serve as a baseline for evaluating 
brightness enhancement at flash frequencies that were too low to 
produce fusion, i.e., the Brücke (1864)  effect. Bartley (1938b)  
suggested that a “dark process” might be  active during the “off ” 
portions of a flash sequence. This could be seen as presaging a dual-
channel hypothesis for encoding luminance, as will be  discussed 
subsequently. However, he  subsequently claimed that this signal 
would cease once the stimulus reached critical flicker frequency, 
which would rule out any contribution to the average intensity of a 
flicker-fused stimulus ( Bartley, 1939 ).
The inventory of studies provided above likely has missed a few 
reports claiming support of the Talbot-Plateau law. The cited studies 
do, however, describe the research tools that would be available for 
testing the Talbot-Plateau law through the early part of the 20th 
century. We respect the ingenuity of early investigators in their efforts 
to evaluate the Talbot-Plateau predictions. However, for the range 
being planned for current work, those tools could not accurately 
measure the amount of light being delivered by the flicker-fused 
stimulus. To assess flash intensity using the inverse-square law would 
require positioning the source up to several hundred meters away. On 
an optical bench this could be  done with mirrors, but the 
corresponding reduction of image size would not provide a usable 
comparison stimulus. Even if the Nicols filters were manufactured 
with the precision of modern polarizing filters, getting a 10% level of 
accuracy would require control over 0.01 degree increments of filter 
position. Modern, electronic equipment makes it possible to examine 
a wider range of conditions and more accurately control timing and 
intensity of the stimulus.
Szilagyi (1969)  used modern electronic equipment to test what 
he  described as the Bunsen-Roscoe law, though in fact he  was 
evaluating the Talbot-Plateau principle. Three respondents adjusted 
current for an LED that was flashing at 30 Hz until it matched the 
brightness of a second LED that was providing steady emission. 
Current was converted to intensity according to separately calibrated 
current vs. intensity measurements. Current pulses that drove the 
emission were calibrated for linearity across about five orders of 
magnitude. Rise and fall times of the pulses were roughly 1 
microsecond. He varied duration of current pulses (yielding flashes) 
from 1 microsecond to 10 milliseconds. The data from three 
respondents fit along a straight line on a log–log plot at a slope of −1, 
affirming the Talbot-Plateau predictions for these test conditions. 
However, the flicker-fused stimuli were displayed against only one level of steady light emission and ambient light level was not specified. 
At best this provides support for the Talbot-Plateau principle across a 
limited range of treatment combinations.
An earlier report from this laboratory included a limited test of 
the Talbot-Plateau principle with stimuli delivered from an LED array 
(Greene, 2015 ). An initial experiment established that a sequence of 
1.3 microsecond flashes, delivered at 24 Hz, was above the flicker-
fusion threshold. Then each trial of the following experiment 
presented letter patterns twice, as steady and flicker-fused stimuli, 
randomly ordered, each for 750 milliseconds. Flash intensity was 
varied across a range as departures from the Talbot-Plateau prediction, 
expecting that higher intensities would be seen as brighter than the 
steady display and lower intensities would appear darker. Respondents 
were asked to say which of the two displays was brighter. (Letter 
identification was not requested, but providing this stimulus diversity 
helped keep respondents engaged in the task). For those displays in 
which the steady and fused flicker displays were judged to be equally 
bright, the calculated average energy of the flash sequence was very 
close to the Talbot-Plateau prediction. The results provided some 
support for the Talbot-Plateau principle, comparable to the Szilagyi 
(1969)  findings, but still insufficient for assessing its validity across 
several brightness levels and various flash duration/
frequency combinations.
Here we  report the findings from two experiments. The first 
varied flash duration of flicker-fused stimuli across five orders of 
magnitude against five octave levels of steady stimulus intensity. The 
second experiment displayed the same five flash durations to assess 
brightness judgments in a lower range of stimulus intensity. This 
extended the range across which flash intensity was tested to roughly 
seven orders of magnitude.
Methods
Stimulus display equipment
Experiments were executed using a 64×64 array of AlGaInP light-
emitting diodes (LEDs), designated as the display board, which have 
peak emission at 630 nanometers (red). Diameters and center-to-
center spacing of the LEDs were 5 mm and 9.4 mm, respectively, and 
the horizontal and vertical spans of the full array were each 60 cm. At 
the observation distance of 3.5 m, the visual angles formed by these 
spans are 4.92 arc´, 9.23 arc´, and 9.80 arc °.
A Mac G4 Cube running Tcl/tk custom applications under OS-X 
provided instructions to a Propox MMnet101 microcontroller. The 
microcontroller, running at 16 MHz, provided machine-language 
instructions to the stimulus display. The microcontroller crystal had a 
stability of 50 ppm, and the average speed for processing firmware 
instructions was 12 MIPs. This system allowed for nominal 
specification of treatment durations as short as 1 μs. (See the 
Supplementary material ).
None of the experimental work involved color comparison, so it 
is appropriate to report the intensity in radiometric units–microwatts 
per solid angle ( μW/sr). Further, physiological studies of 
photoreceptors with monochromatic or LED light sources often report 
stimulus energy in radiometric units ( Schnapf et al., 1990 ; Packer 
et al., 1996 ; Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1999 ; Field et al., 2009 ; Cangiano 
et al., 2012 ; Cao et al., 2014 ). With such narrow-range light sources Greene and Morrison 10.3389/fnins.2023.1169162
Frontiers in Neuroscience 04 frontiersin.orgthe responses of red and green cones as a function of intensity are very 
similar ( Schnapf et al., 1990 ).
Intensity was measured using a Thorlabs PM100 radiometer with 
S120C calibrated silicon photodiode sensor. The calibration process 
started with power measurements of the display at 1 m, with a single 
LED turned on and taking readings across a range of LED voltage 
settings. The reading in microwatts ( μW) was converted to radiant 
intensity in μW/sr by dividing the solid angle of the sensor (at 1 m, the 
sensor solid angle is essentially the same as its area in m2). Then, 
power measurements were recorded over a wider range of voltages, at 
small increments, with the sensor placed directly against the display. 
These readings were scaled to match the 1 m intensities for 
corresponding voltages. This calibration produced a table of 100 
samples from 0.0001 to 70,000 μW/sr. Experiment applications used 
linear interpolations from this table to convert a requested intensity 
to the necessary LED voltage.
Ambient illumination in the test room was 10 lux, as measured 
with a calibrated Tektronix J1811 photometer. At this light level, 
average pupil diameter was previously found to be  6.66 mm. This 
provides a basis for calculating the total energy of an LED flash, in 
photons, as seen by the respondent: radiant intensity ( μW/sr) x flash 
duration ( μs) x 9.019 (which adjusts for wavelength, pupil diameter, 
and source distance).
Voltage measurements were taken at an LED to confirm that the 
number of dots turned on at one time had minimal effect on actual 
intensity. Turning on 48 dots on a 64-dot module reduced the voltage 
less than 3% compared to turning on a single dot.
Oscilloscope traces were captured with an Advanced Photonix 
PDB-C156 PIN silicon photodiode in unbiased, unamplified 
photovoltaic mode. This is a fast photodiode that has a response time 
of 15 ns. The traces were taken with an appropriate load resistor to 
convert the current output into a voltage that was measured by a 1X 
voltage probe. Flash intensity was verified by comparing oscilloscope 
traces for flashing and steady emission.
Rise and fall times for this kind of LED are each 30 ns or less. For 
long flash durations this is nominal and the oscilloscope trace can 
be described as a square wave. For the 1 μs flash one sees a shoulder at 
the top of the rising phase and a belly on the falling phase, providing 
counterbalance of light emission.
All durations of flashes were also found to have a 0.3 μs transient 
of light emission at the offset of the voltage command, designated as 
an “off pulse, ” due to flyback voltage from LED inductance. The 
amplitude of the off pulse gets added to the overall quantity of light 
from the flash. To determine the total light energy being delivered, 
additional radiometer measurements were taken during periodic 
flashing at 500 Hz and higher (well above the meter analog averaging 
bandwidth of 30 Hz) for a range of flash durations and intensities. 
Traces did not show any differential in flash characteristics for single 
flashes versus those being driven at this frequency. These 
measurements were compared to steady intensity, and an empirical 
time-dependent compensation formula for the voltage-to-intensity 
conversion was determined.
For simplicity, flash durations used as experimental treatments are 
given as integers, and the reported intensities are the average of 
intensities across all portions of the flash, including the off pulse. 
Therefore duration x intensity provides a proper index of total flash 
energy, within the resolution of voltage command increments, 
irrespective of the flash duration that was commanded.Stimulus letters
Each letter of the alphabet was represented by a discrete pattern 
of dots, as illustrated in Figure  1 . The letters were styled as Arial 
33-point TrueType fonts. Supplementary Table S1  lists the number of 
dots in each letter as well as letter dimensions, specifically heights and 
widths in dot count and degrees of visual angle.
Approval of protocols and informed 
consent
Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at USC. Sixteen respondents were recruited from the USC 
Department of Psychology Subject Pool, each having a broad choice 
among alternative experiments being conducted. Eight of the 
respondents provided data for the first experiment, and eight others 
provided data for the second experiment. Each respondent was 
provided with a general description of the display conditions and the 
judgments that were required. Each was informed that participation 
could be discontinued at any time without penalty.
Task demands
There were several experimental conditions that were the same for 
both experiments. Treatment levels for the various experiments were 
developed through pilot testing of respondents. Unless noted 
otherwise, once treatment levels were adopted for a given experiment, 
the data from all subsequent respondents have been included in the 
statistical analysis and modeling.
For a given display, all the dots forming a given letter pattern were 
activated together, i.e., providing simultaneous emission from all the 
dots forming the pattern. For a given experiment, the presentation 
order for each combination of treatments was determined at random 
for each respondent. Respondents were tested individually. Each

Frontiers in Neuroscience 05 frontiersin.orgjudged the stimulus displays using both eyes, allowing vision 
correction as needed. No feedback about the accuracy of the response 
was provided. The task did not require rapid response, but responses 
were usually provided with minimal delay. Responses were recorded 
by clicking on-screen buttons. Neither the respondent nor the 
experimenter was provided with any information about what 
treatment was being displayed on a given trial. Most test sessions were 
completed in about 40 min.
Experimental treatments and protocols
Experiment 1 provided treatments to evaluate predictions of the 
Talbot-Plateau law across an extended range of flash duration and 
intensity levels. Letter patterns were displayed as stimuli, but 
respondents were not asked to identify the letters, only to judge the 
relative brightness when the patterns were shown with steady emission 
of light and also with a 24 Hz flash sequence, i.e., as a fused-flicker 
display. This experiment used an adaptive protocol, wherein the 
intensity of flashes was adjusted up if the fused-flicker display 
appeared dimmer than the steady display, and adjusted down if it 
appeared to be brighter. The steady and fused-flicker displays were 
each shown for 500 ms on a given trial, with a 300 ms interval 
between displays.
There were five steady intensity treatment levels, these being 0.01, 
0.02, 0.04, 0.08, and 0.16 μW/sr. Flash durations of 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 
and 10,000 μs were used for the fused-flicker displays, wherein the 
intensity to be used with a given flash duration was set near the level 
predicted by the Talbot-Plateau law, these being subject to adjustment 
on the basis of respondent’s assessment of relative brightness. The five 
steady intensity levels combined against five durations (with 
corresponding flash intensities), which provided 25 treatment 
combinations. The letter to be used for a given treatment combination 
was chosen at random.
For the initial display of a given treatment combination, the 
intensity of the flash was set at the intensity that would be predicted 
by the Talbot-Plateau law, but with a 20% adjustment, randomly 
making the flash brighter or dimmer than the prediction. Whether the 
steady or fused-flicker display came first or second on a given trial was 
determined at random.
The respondent was required to judge which of the two displays 
was brighter, the first (scored as 1), the second (scored as 2), or they 
appeared equal in brightness, i.e., Same (scored as 0). Once the 
experimenter recorded the verbal response of the respondent, the 
computer took note of which stimulus had come first, and determined 
whether to increase or decrease the intensity of the flash sequence on 
the next trial that treatment combination was displayed. Increments 
or decrements of flash intensity were in steps of 15% from the value 
delivered on a given trial.
On initial trials a few respondents were only able to see one 
pattern rather than two. Pilot work had determined that respondents 
were always able to see a steady display that was shown at one of the 
five treatment levels. However, the initial adjustment of the fused-
flicker stimulus could drop the flash intensity to a level where the 
pattern had insufficient energy to reach threshold, so the respondent 
was seeing only display of the steady stimulus. To deal with this 
possibility, respondents were told to report if they only saw one 
display, not two. This was scored as 3 by the experimenter, which automatically resulted in an increment of subsequent displays -- the 
same as if they had judged the fused-flicker display as being dimmer 
than the steady display.
A termination condition for the adaptive protocol was provided. 
For a given treatment combination, if the fused-flicker and steady 
displays were judged as being equal in brightness (Same) on five 
separate trials, no additional trials were run for that treatment 
combination. The total number of trials was capped at 400. Upon 
completion of testing, the responses were tallied for each treatment 
combination, the recorded intensities that had received a Same 
judgment were averaged, and those values are described as the 
“observed” flash intensities for purposes of evaluating the Talbot-
Plateau predictions.
Experiment 2 tested whether the Talbot-Plateau law would extend 
to a lower range of flash and steady intensities, these being closer to 
perceptual threshold. Four levels of steady intensity were tested, 
specifically: 0.0024, 0.0048, 0.0072, and 0.0096 μW/sr. As in 
Experiment 1, flash durations were 1, 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 μs, 
each being used in a 24 Hz fused-flicker sequence at an initial intensity 
that was 10% above or below the Talbot-Plateau prediction. The total 
number of trials was set at 360. Other than the differences described 
above, all other experimental conditions were the same as for 
Experiment 1.
Results
Evaluating Talbot-Plateau law across more 
than five orders of magnitude
Experiment 1 asked respondents to judge letter patterns that were 
displayed twice on a given trial, once as a 24 Hz flash sequence and 
also as a steady display, both being shown for half a second. The 
anchor for brightness judgments was provided by the intensities used 
for the steady displays. Five octaves of steady intensity were tested, the 
dimmest being 0.01 μW/sr and the brightest being 0.16 μW/sr.
The 24 Hz flash sequences will also be described as flicker-fused 
displays, this serving to affirm that they appeared to observers as 
providing steady emission of light. Prior research had found the 50% 
threshold for flicker fusion to be about 15 Hz with 1 μs flashes. At 
24 Hz, very few respondents reported seeing any flicker, and those that 
did saw it on only a few trials ( Greene, 2015 ).
The display system provided control of flash durations and 
stimulus intervals with a resolution of 1 μs (see Methods for details). 
The flicker-fused treatments varied flash duration across five orders of 
magnitude, with the briefest flashes being 1 μs and the longest being 
10,000 μs. Intensity of flicker-fused displays was varied using an 
adaptive protocol to determine the flash intensity that would appear 
equal in brightness to its steady-emission partner. With a given 
treatment combination, if respondents judged the flicker-fused display 
to be dimmer than the steady display, the flash intensity was raised on 
the next display of that treatment combination. The flash intensity was 
reduced if it was judged to be brighter. The values being reported and 
statistically evaluated here are the means across all judgments where 
the respondents said that the two members of the pair appeared to 
be equal in brightness.
Initial data plots of these judgments are shown in Figure  2 , 
wherein the Talbot-Plateau principle has been reframed so that the Greene and Morrison 10.3389/fnins.2023.1169162
Frontiers in Neuroscience 06 frontiersin.orgdata can be shown across the full range of treatment combinations as 
a single plot-line. In each panel of Figure 2 , the observed matching 
flash intensity (log scaled) is shown on the ordinate and the value that 
would be predicted by application of the Talbot-Plateau principle is 
shown on the abscissa. The data for each of the eight respondents is 
provided in separate panels, with the group means being shown in the 
ninth panel. The plot-line in each of the panels reflects the Talbot-
Plateau prediction, i.e., the observations would exactly match 
prediction if they fell exactly on this line.
Regression analysis for the group means provided an R2 value of 
0.9966, and a p < 0.0001. A mixed model was also applied to account 
for multiple points being from the same respondent, and the results 
were comparable. Regressions that were run on each respondent 
yielded R2 values that ranged from 0.9962 to 0.9981, all significant at 
p < 0.0001. Pearson and Spearman correlations were both 0.9983, 
across respondents, the smallest Pierson and Spearman correlations 
were 0.9981 and 0.9977, respectively.
Figure 2  appears to provide strong support for the Talbot-Plateau 
law across an extended range of flash durations and intensities. One 
should remember, however, that the data are being shown on a log 
scale, which can shrink departures from prediction to the point that 
they appear insignificant. Differentials in intensity, when specified 
with less scale contraction, do not seem inconsequential. In particular, 
one can specify the ratio of observed to expected flash intensities, 
non-transformed, and find that they range in size from 0.85 to 1.55, 
with Talbot-Plateau prediction being a ratio of 1.00. So the flash 
intensity can be roughly 50% higher than the steady intensity at the point where the respondent judges them to be equal in brightness. 
There are conditions where a 50% increase in intensity can have a 
significant influence on perception, so it may be too soon to declare a 
ratio of 1.55 as being inconsequential.
With careful inspection of plot points across the panels of 
Figure 2 , one may perceive small consistencies in placement relative 
to the plot-line, suggesting some micro-structure across the range. As 
evidence that this is not purely imagined, one can note that the 
deviations seen in the group means are about as large as those seen in 
the individual respondent data. This would not be  the case if the 
respondent deviations were random departures from the Talbot-
Plateau prediction. If that were true, the standard-error of the mean 
should be reduced, and the plot-points for the group should fall on the 
line or much closer to it.
Sources of consistent deviation from prediction can be more 
readily seen where the same data are shown using the original 
formulation of the Talbot-Plateau law, namely that the average 
intensity of the flashed sequence is equal to the intensity of the 
steady display. One should recall that the average flash intensity is 
the value derived from calculating the intensity of the flash 
multiplied by the duty cycle for a given flash period. Said otherwise, 
one is averaging the intensity of the flash with the dark portion of 
the flash period. According to the Talbot Plateau law, the average 
flash intensity should equal the steady intensity irrespective of the 
flash duration, for the duty cycle accounts for the differentials in 
flash duration. Therefore, all the flash duration plot-points for a 
given steady intensity should fall at the same location on the

observations did not quite match the predictions.
These data were not normally distributed, so differentials of 
treatment effect were tested with a nonparametric one-way 
ANOV A. This analysis found significant differences in mean values 
(Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.0001) and variance measures (Ansari-
Bradley one-way analysis, p = 0.0135).
To examine for differentials in flash duration effect, a signed-
rank test was applied to determine whether the average flash 
intensity minus the steady intensity differed significantly from 0. 
Median differences for 1 μs and 10 μs flash durations were 0.0061 
and 0.0029 ( p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0437), respectively, reflecting 
intensity settings that were higher than predicted by Talbot-
Plateau. The 1,000 μs flash duration produced a median difference 
of −0.0060, this being lower than predicted and significant at 
p < 0.0001. The 100 μs and 10,000 μs treatment levels had median 
differences of −0.0007 and 0.0011 ( p = 0.0627 and 0.4192), 
respectively, neither proving to be significantly different from the 
predicted zero value.
Evaluating the Talbot-Plateau law across a 
low-intensity range
Experiment 1 examined the Talbot-Plateau law across a large 
range of intensities, these being at levels where brightness would 
commonly be evaluated. A second experiment extended the tests into 
a lower range that would be used to examine probability of recognition 
and/or detection as a function of flash intensity. Any departure from 
the Talbot-Plateau prediction could indicate a breakdown of 
physiological mechanism or a limit on the validity of the calibration 
process. Knowing how well the brightness judgments continued to 
match the Talbot-Plateau predictions could be useful in designing 
experiments that probed the threshold for shape recognition.
Four levels of steady intensity were evaluated, ranging from 
0.0024 μW/sr to 0.0096 (so ending just below the lowest intensity of 
0.01 μW/sr used in Experiment 1). The same five levels of flash 
duration were used, the minimum being 1 μs and the longest being 10,000 μs. At the highest steady display the predicted flash intensity at 
each duration was just under the lowest value in Experiment 1. For 
example, for the 1 μs flash sequence the lowest in Experiment 1 was 
417 μW/sr and the highest intensity in Experiment 2 was 400 μW/sr. 
The lowest steady and flash intensities in this series were likely just 
above threshold. Whereas all of the respondents for which data is 
reported were able to see each display pair, one individual was unable 
to see all the displays, reporting either that only one pattern was 
shown or that none could be seen.
Figure 4  shows plots of means for individual respondents and for 
the group, with the plot-lines representing the Talbot-Plateau 
prediction. The plot-points for each respondent fall very close to this 
prediction across most of the range, with departures being most 
conspicuous at the low end of the range.
A log-scale regression was calculated across respondents. The 
analysis yielded an R2 of 0.9950 and significance level of p < 0.0001. 
Pearson and Spearman correlations were 0.9975 and 0.9978, 
respectively. A mixed model was also calculated to account for 
multiple points being provided by a given respondent, and the results 
were substantially the same. Regression models for each individual 
respondent provided R2 values that ranged from 0.9902 to 0.9983, each 
having a p < 0.0001, Across respondents, the smallest Pearson and 
Spearman correlations were 0.9951 and 0.9970, respectively.
Figure 5  plots the data from Experiment 2 rendered as average 
flash intensity. Here the departures from Talbot-Plateau prediction 
are more conspicuous than was found in Experiment 1. However, 
the range of intensities used in this experiment were much smaller, 
allowing data to be plotted on a linear rather than logarithmic 
scale. This could magnify the apparent size of departures 
from prediction.
Data were normally distributed, so a parametric one-way ANOV A 
was applied to examine the influence of flash duration on these 
brightness judgments. The mean differences were significant with 
p < 0.0001. Each duration treatment was then examined with t-tests, 
to determine whether average flash intensity minus steady intensity 
differed from zero. Mean differences for the 1 μs flashes were brighter 
than predicted by the Talbot-Plateau law. The mean difference was 
0.0012, which was significant at p < 0.0001. The mean differences were 
smaller than predicted for 1,000 μs and 10,000 μs flashes, these values 
being −0.0010 and − 0.0014, respectively. Each of the differences 
proved to be significant at p < 0.0001. Treatment effects for 10 μs and 
100 μs flashes were not significant ( p = 0.0682 and 0.3484, respectively).
We might speculate about the basis for significant deviation from 
the Talbot-Plateau prediction. It is possible that we have reached the 
limits of precision for the display equipment. If so, additional 
calibration efforts might provide future experiments with results that 
reduce or eliminate these departures. Alternatively, perhaps we are 
reaching the physiological limits for which the Talbot-Plateau law can 
apply. Flashes might become progressively less effective as the duration 
is reduced, as suggested by the ordered size of departure that can 
be seen in the Figure 5  plot. If so, one would expect the differentials to 
be  larger as one approached the threshold of perception, but the 
scatter in Figure 5  is larger for the brighter flashes. Further, if one were 
reaching physiological limits for the flicker-fused mechanisms, one 
would expect the departures to be  consistently to one side of the 
predicted plot-line, not equally balanced on each side of the line. 
We do not think the current findings provide a basis for setting limits 
on the validity of the Talbot-Plateau law.
FIGURE 3
The straight line specifies the Talbot-Plateau prediction that average 
flash intensity will equal steady intensity when the two displays are 
judged as appearing equally bright. One can see systematic 
differences produced by flash durations, with the 1  μs flashes 
diverging especially from the prediction.Greene and Morrison 10.3389/fnins.2023.1169162
Frontiers in Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.orgDiscussion
Generating a precise flicker-fused stimulus
The Talbot-Plateau law specifies that the brightness perception 
that is generated by the flicker-fused stimulus must match what is 
generated by a steady stimulus. This requires that the product of flash duration and flash frequency must be reciprocal, providing a constant 
level of light flux that exactly equals the flux of a steady stimulus. To 
explain this reciprocity, Ferree and Rand (1915)  proposed that flashes 
produced progressively less impact as their duration was reduced. 
Thus a white or colored zone that would have a high level of brightness 
when not moving would be  seen as darker if the spinning wheel 
provided only brief glimpses. The brevity of stimulation was viewed 
as providing less “intensity” of stimulation, so as speed of spinning 
increased the frequency of the flashes, the intensity being delivered by 
the white sector would be correspondingly reduced. While they made 
no mention of the Bunsen and Roscoe (1855)  law, their proposal had 
much in common with its principles.
The photochemical mechanisms of the retina might well provide 
for reciprocity of duration and frequency, as specified by the Bunsen 
and Roscoe (1855)  law. This law has been invoked for explaining 
duration/frequency reciprocity for threshold perception of short 
flashes, i.e., the Bloch effect ( Bloch, 1885 ; Hartline, 1928 , 1934 ; 
Brindley, 1952 ). Hartline (1928)  examined the photoreceptor response 
in a number of arthropods, varying flash intensities and durations, 
and confirmed that the size of the response was determined by the 
total energy in the stimulus. In 1934 he again examined the issue using 
a rotating disk to control flash duration and frequency and reported 
reciprocity of light energy for flash durations of up to 100 milliseconds 
(Hartline, 1934 ). Szilagyi (1969)  invoked the Bunsen-Roscoe law as 
the basis for finding equal brightness for flicker-fused and 
steady stimuli.
Even if the Bunsen-Roscoe law is correct, with photopigments 
registering every photon that the stimulus delivers, that activation 
must then be  reliably conveyed to the brain where brightness is 
FIGURE 4
Experiment 2 tested the Talbot-Plateau predictions within low ranges of flash and steady intensities. The observed flash intensities, when plotted on a 
log scale for each of the respondents, were very close to the Talbot-Plateau prediction, this being the solid diagonal line in each of the panels.
FIGURE 5
The data from Experiment 2 have been plotted as average flash 
intensity versus steady intensity. The Talbot-Plateau prediction, 
shown by the diagonal plot-line, is that the two displays will appear 
equal in brightness when the average flash intensity equals the 
steady intensity. One can see consistent departures from this 
prediction, with progressively greater intensity being required as the 
duration of the flashes was reduced.Greene and Morrison 10.3389/fnins.2023.1169162
Frontiers in Neuroscience 09 frontiersin.orgperceived. We  need to specify the neural mechanisms that could 
accomplish the brightness matching predicted by the Talbot-Plateau 
law. Perhaps the light energy of the flash fills in the dark interval 
through visible persistence. The concept of persistence, sometimes 
characterized as afterimages, was central to the thinking of 19th 
century investigators. Von Helmholtz (1910) , p. 212–215 commented 
on the weakening of persistent traces as ambient light levels increased, 
with a presumption that residual influence would cease to be present, 
or at least become imperceptible, in full daylight. Early discussions 
noted changes in the frequency at which fusion would occur, though 
specific measures were not reported until well into the 20th century. 
The early investigators readily embraced the idea that the brief 
exposure to light from a white sector of a spinning disk would provide 
sustained retinal activation that carried across the absence of light 
from the dark sector. Helmholtz, among others, gave substantial 
attention not only to temporal integration of black and white, but also 
to the blending of colors. One could readily assume there must be a 
limit to the temporal resolving power of the visual system that caps 
one’s ability to distinguish the individual flashes. Once the frequency 
passed the resolution threshold, the flashes would fuse and be seen as 
a steady source of light. Walker et al. (1943)  said that retinal persistence 
was surely responsible for flicker fusion, the mechanism being the 
same as in motion pictures.
The persistence concept might seem reasonable where light and 
dark intervals were of similar duration, but it becomes problematic for 
low duty-cycle displays where each flash is extremely bright and each 
dark interval is extremely long. For example, where the flash duration 
is one microsecond and flash frequency is 25 Hz, the dark interval that 
follows the flash is essentially 40 milliseconds. The intensity of the 
flash would be roughly 40,000 times brighter than the steady stimulus, 
which would have to be precisely measured and then drained at a rate 
that completely filled the interval without leaving any residual. An 
electrical engineer might describe the mechanism as being like a 
“leaky capacitor, ” where the capacitor is quickly charged by the flash 
energy and the voltage is drained off slowly at a steady rate. But the 
neurons would also have to precisely measure the length of the period 
between flashes and then adjust the rate of energy discharge according 
to how much energy the flash had provided. While it is possible that 
retinal circuits accomplish this task, we have no evidence at present 
that they have this ability.
One might also consider that the after-effects of stimulation can 
produce reverse perceptual effects, e.g., negative after-images. The 
energy provided by a flash might be eliciting a biphasic response, and 
there is a long history of work showing that the cessation of light 
generates its own signal. Let us now consider the possibility that the 
Talbot-Plateau principle is based on a system that counterbalances 
light and dark signals.
Counterbalance of on and off retinal 
channels
Adrian and Matthews (1927) , Granit (1933) , and Hartline (1938)  
described OFF responses from retina that were generated by the 
cessation of steady illumination. Bartley (1939)  asserted that the “dark 
phase” served as an “entity” that could suppress activation that was 
produced by the flash that preceded it. He did not specify what neural 
mechanism might be  providing this counterbalance, but his formulations did imply some kind of signal generation. Many 
hundreds of articles have subsequently confirmed and provided 
details with respect to the anatomy and physiology of ON and OFF 
retinal mechanisms. Excellent reviews were provided by Schiller 
(1992) , Schiller (2010) , and Chalupa and Günhan (2004) .
Enroth (1952 , 1953)  provided the first documentation that 
activities of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cells were relevant to flicker 
fusion. She recorded the frequency at which the cells in cat retina 
ceased to follow stimulus flicker, and described the cessation of 
activity as the flicker became fused. She asserted that flicker-fusion 
frequencies for the ON and OFF retinal ganglion cells matched what 
Dodt (1951)  had reported for fusion of ERG pulses and subjective 
fusion in humans. This finding suggested that alternate activation of 
ON and OFF ganglion cells mediated perception of flicker, such that 
one no longer perceived flicker once the ganglion cells reached the 
limit of frequency that they could follow. However, specifying the 
frequency at which the flicker subjectively fuses, i.e., is no longer 
perceived as separate pulses of light, did not explain why the average 
intensity of a flicker-fused stimuli would equal the intensity of a steady 
stimulus. Further, defining cessation of flash “following” as the 
condition that would produce subjective fusion does not specify the 
nature of flicker-fused neural activity, or in particular, what the 
ganglion cells are doing in response to steady and flicker-fused stimuli. 
The mechanism for signaling the net energy of each stimulus was 
not articulated.
A number of investigators suggested that transient-responding 
channels change to provide sustained response once the frequency of 
flashes becomes sufficiently high ( Granit, 1955 ; Arduini and Pinneo, 
1962 ; Arduini, 1963 ; Pinneo and Heath, 1967 ). DeValois et al. (1962)  
observed differentials for ON and OFF channels using extracellular 
recordings from lateral geniculate nucleus of macaques. Firing rates 
either increased or decreased, roughly proportional to log intensity of 
the luminance. Arduini (1963)  noted that above about 35 Hz the 
discharge of ON and OFF channels is constant at a level that is 
comparable to the average level of discharge being registered in a gross 
electrode. Pinneo and Heath (1967)  proposed a two-stage process for 
registering flash sequences, with a detailed discussion of phasic 
responses transitioning to a frequency-fused tonic state. They also 
presented results of recordings taken from two patients who had depth 
electrodes implanted for therapeutic purposes into the optic tract and 
lateral geniculate nucleus. Neither patient had visual impairments. 
They used a steady light set at 2.5 lux, and varied flash frequencies 
from 1 to 50 Hz. Patients reported whether they saw flicker or steady 
light levels. With onset of flicker, net activity measured from the optic 
tract of the first patient increased with each increase in frequency up 
to a peak at 12 Hz. Above 12 Hz the frequency decreased with each 
step up to about 33 Hz at which point the activity level became 
constant for all higher frequencies. With stimulation frequencies of 
33 Hz and beyond the flash sequence was perceived as being fused, 
with a brightness that was the same as the steady light. Optic nerve 
spiking was constant at this frequency and remained so at higher 
frequencies, and perceived brightness was unchanged. The second 
patient gave comparable results.
These findings support the hypothesis that ON and OFF channels 
work together to provide brightness perception, delivering brief 
(phasic) bursts of firing in response to sequential flashes, sustained 
(tonic) levels of firing when the frequency of the sequence becomes 
sufficiently high, and also providing sustained firing in response to a Greene and Morrison 10.3389/fnins.2023.1169162
Frontiers in Neuroscience 10 frontiersin.orgsteady stimulus. If valid, one should see tonic activity being delivered 
from the retina as a function of light level. Barlow and Levick (1969)  
did locate some ganglion cells in the cat retina that manifested 
“unusually regular maintained discharge, ” the rate of firing being a 
function of the level of the adapting stimulus. These cells had ON or 
OFF concentric receptive fields, but they provided a very sluggish 
response to moving stimuli and lacked the brisk activation that was 
typical for other ganglion cells. They found only three of these cells, 
which they described as “luminance units. ” While such low density 
might seem adequate for registering the brightness of large zones, e.g., 
a light-blue cloudless sky, these would not seem to be  suitable 
candidates for specifying the brightness of a small spot of steady light, 
or flicker-fused flashes from that spot.
Output of retinal activity is provided by optic nerve fibers, these 
being the axons of retinal ganglion cells. Gouras (1968)  observed that 
some retinal ganglion cells of macaque responded to light increments 
with transient activity, while others gave tonic responses. Margolis and 
Detwiler (2007)  examined tonic activity of ON and OFF ganglion 
cells, and report that OFF activity sustained by intrinsic pacemaker 
mechanisms. Zhou et al. (2017)  provide an extensive evaluation of 
tonic and transient responses of retinal ganglion cells, outlining seven 
alternative mechanisms for how the two types of activation 
are generated.
Tikidji-Hamburyan et  al. (2015)  did multichannel recordings 
from ganglion cells in mice, providing full-field luminance across a 5 
log range. A majority of the neurons registered luminance transitions 
irrespective of level, but a given cell provided stable responses at a 
specific steady luminance level. They found many instances where 
transient OFF activity could be elicited from ON cells, and vice versa. 
These results raise the intriguing possibility that the ON and OFF 
pathways register temporal contrast as a contribution to scene analysis 
(see below), but also provide steady activity that determines the 
brightness of a given region.
Counterbalance of cortical mechanisms
Various researchers have debated the question of whether 
perception of brightness is based on integrating the flash responses in 
the retina or in cortex. Sherrington (1902 , 1904)  reported that 
stimulation of one eye yielded results that were consistent with the 
Talbot-Plateau principle, but dichoptic conditions that required 
synthesis of the stimuli in visual cortex did not. He reported that 
where the fused-flicker stimuli provided each eye with a different 
brightness, the cortex provided perception that was the average of the 
two. From this he  concluded that Talbot-Plateau integration was 
accomplished at the level of the retina. Crozier and Wolf (1941)  
re-evaluated the issue and supported Sherrington’s position. Shevell 
et al. (1992)  have taken the opposite view, providing evidence for a 
cortical basis for contrast and assimilation of brightness using 
dichoptic stimulation. However, their focus was on center/surround 
receptive field mechanisms, so their results may not directly bear on 
the issue of Talbot-Plateau integration.
Bartley (1938a ,b, 1937)  suggested that cortex is responsible for 
assessing the brightness of flicker-fused stimuli. However, most of 
his rambling analysis was devoted to the Brücke (1864)  effect--
brightness enhancement--that is produced at frequencies that are 
below the fusion threshold. His work some decades later ( Nelson and Bartley, 1964 ) provided a more explicit hypothesis which they 
described as an “alternation-of-response” mechanism. It proposed 
that brightness judgment is based on the sum of neural activity 
received in the visual cortex, noting that each input channel has a 
refractory period. A brief flash can elicit synchronized activity that 
produces a strong response. Various channel elements have 
different refractory periods, so a steady response produces 
non-synchronized firing that is at a lower net energy. Here again, 
it should be said that much of their work was directed toward 
evaluating Brücke enhancement of brightness at sub-fusion 
frequencies, and they gave very few details about experimental 
method. They provided minimal evidence in support of the claim 
that Talbot-Plateau integration is provided by the cortex.
During this period, extracellular recordings of neurons in cortex 
were failing to see steady, sustained responses that might reflect the 
perception of stimulus brightness ( Hubel, 1958 ; Jung, 1964 ; Wurtz, 
1969 ; Poggio, 1972 ). It was something of a surprise, therefore, when 
Bartlet and Doty (1974)  reported the existence of “luxotonic” units in 
primary visual cortex of squirrel monkey, with similar findings 
subsequently reported for macaques ( Kayama et al., 1979 ). Nearly half 
of the units studied by Bartlet and Doty (1974)  and a quarter of those 
studied by Kayama et al. (1979)  provided sustained response to diffuse 
light levels, while still manifesting both ON and OFF response 
properties. These neurons delivered a transient response with initial 
onset of the light, which provided the basis for the ON and OFF 
classification. However, after this initial transient activity, they 
continued with a steady firing rate for as long as the illumination 
remained the same. Rate of discharge was generally monotonic, either 
rising or declining as a function of light intensity over a range of at 
least three log units. Many of the cells also responded to other stimulus 
attributes, e.g., motion, providing for what might be called multiplexed 
registration of image information. Responses did not show any 
transitions that might reflect rod saturation as light levels were 
increased, supporting their hypothesis that the luxotonic units were 
being driven by cones, the influence being passed up through midget 
and parvocellular channels.
The proposal that steady brightness information might be signaled 
by tonic activity in two sub-populations, i.e., being driven by OFF as 
well as ON channels, was a departure from the concept that brightness 
would be  specified by the firing rate of a single “luminance” 
population. Doty (1977)  suggested the terms “photergic” and 
“scotergic” to describe the two classes of neurons, one that raises its 
firing rate in response to increasing luminance and the other doing so 
as the light level is reduced.
Doty and associates ( Bartlet and Doty, 1974 ; Doty, 1977 ; Kayama 
et al., 1979 ) thought it likely that prior investigators had not seen 
steady discharge to steady light levels because a majority of the work 
had been done under anesthesia or using other pharmacological 
agents. They noted that anesthetics, even ones as mild as nitrous oxide, 
eliminated luxotonic responding in ON as well as OFF units. The 
phasic responses were not subject to this impairment, or at least the 
responses were less fully suppressed.
Peng and Van Essen (2005)  provided further evidence supporting 
the dual-channel hypothesis. They monitored responses in V1 and V2 
of macaque to a large zone that slowly oscillated across a large range 
of luminance values. Some neurons increased their firing rate as 
luminance increased and others increased their firing rate as 
luminance decreased, consistent with the findings of Doty and Greene and Morrison 10.3389/fnins.2023.1169162
Frontiers in Neuroscience 11 frontiersin.orgassociates ( op. cit. ). Most of the neurons appeared to be tuned to a 
limited range of luminance. This would support a proposal that 
specific brightness judgments, i.e., perceived gray level, is provided by 
selective neuronal response to stimulus attributes, similar to 
orientation selectivity.
Smith et al. (2015)  detail the segregation of ON and OFF channels 
in carnivores and primates as the luminance information passes from 
retina, through lateral geniculate nucleus, with convergence onto the 
layer 4 neurons in V1. The activity relays from there to the complex 
cells of layer 2/3, where the cells have overlapping ON and OFF 
response fields. These investigators found that the neurons in layer 2/3 
responded to rising or falling luminance with firing rates that matched 
Doty’s dual-channel hypothesis. Most of the neurons provided 
transient responses, but a small portion were thought to 
be “luxotonic” cells.
Y ang et al. (2022)  used multichannel extracellular electrodes to 
register activity from various layers of V1 cortex in alert monkeys. 
Superficial layers that receive the sensory input were more strongly 
activated by luminance of the stimulus surface than by the edges. 
However, edges dominated activity in the output layers of V1, and they 
suggest that the edge information contributes to “filling in” the 
perception of luminance within the interior of a stimulus.
What evolutionary benefit?
A critical question remains, which is to explain what might be the 
functional benefit of a balanced dual-channel system. The historical 
claims for reciprocity of light and dark in the perception of brightness, 
formalized in the Talbot-Plateau law, appear to be valid across a very 
large range of light intensity, as well as diverse combinations of flash 
duration and frequency. The visual system is providing fairly precise 
encoding of the light and dark transitions being delivered by a flicker-
fused stimulus. Such precision is not compelled by physical or 
chemical principles. One might invoke the Bunsen and Roscoe (1855)  
law that specifies reciprocity of flash intensity and duration in 
producing photochemical reaction products. The chemical cascade 
that is launched when the photopigment captures light might well 
conform to the Bunsen-Roscoe law. But from that point on we are 
dealing with physiological signal-generating mechanisms, and we do 
not think a high precision dual-channel system would evolve unless it 
had a functional benefit.
We submit that the balanced dual-channel mechanism is 
designed to register the luminance of each local zone in the image, 
providing stability of the perception in the presence of eye and 
stimulus motion. The eyes are in continuous motion as a scene is 
being scanned ( Kowler, 2011 ; Gegenfurtner, 2016 ). Even when one 
is engaged in steady fixation of a target, the eye is quivering, 
drifting, and executing microsaccades. At one moment an object 
will be displayed to one patch of photoreceptors, and a moment 
later its image falls on a different patch. The same translation of 
image content would occur with stimulus motion. Precise 
recording of the luminance would contribute to translation 
invariance when registering a moving object or where eye 
movement changes image location.
Further, luminance may need to be registered with precision to 
correctly assess gradients of brightness. Those gradients can be critical 
for perceiving shape from shading, as provided by curvature of a surface ( Kunsberg and Zucker, 2014 ; Antensteiner et al., 2018 ; Bartal 
et al., 2018 ; Holtmann-Rice et al., 2018 ). A consistent gradient of 
curvature would need to be reported as the object moved from one 
location in the visual field to another. If each zone in the retina were 
not precisely tuned for registering luminance, the shape of the surface 
would undergo constant deformation as the object moved or as the 
eye slowly scanned across it.
If eye motion is stabilized to prevent translation of an image, the 
luminance, contrast, and chromatic differentials can disappear rapidly 
(Y arbus, 1967 ; Murakami et al., 2006 ). Similar changes take place if the 
image information is displayed in a Ganzfeld ( Gur, 1989 , 1991 ). It is 
thought that successive contour transitions across luminance 
boundaries maintain transient responses from receptive fields but also 
stabilize activity of “luxotonic” cells that register brightness and color 
(Gur, 1987 ; Gur and Snodderly, personal communication). We submit 
that the flicker-fused stimulus is providing temporal activation that is 
very similar to that generated by tremor and microsaccades. These 
movements provide successive glimpses of a given image location, 
similar to the successive flashes of a flicker-fused stimulus. We are 
proposing that being able to register the average intensity of a flicker-
fused display derives from mechanisms that evolved to provide stable 
perception of contrast and luminance.
Coda
A key feature of the Talbot-Plateau law is the requirement for 
reciprocity of flash duration and frequency. This principle often holds 
for photochemical reactions (Bunsen-Roscoe law) as well as 
photoelectric effect with purified silicon. But it seemed improbable 
that signaling systems of the visual system could average the intensity 
of a sequence of light flashes as a match to steady intensity, and do so 
for various combinations of flash intensity and duration. One might 
think this could be accomplished by persistence of stimulus influence 
for a 50% duty cycle, where the flash sequence provides light for half 
of each period and the average intensity is simply double the intensity 
of the steady source. But for an extreme combination, such as the one 
microsecond flash at 25 hertz, the period of darkness is essentially 
40 ms. The energy of the flash would have to be measured with great 
precision and then drained out, like a leaky capacitor, at exactly the 
right rate to fill that void. It does not seem plausible that the reciprocity 
proscribed by the Talbot-Plateau law could be  accomplished by 
visible persistence.
The present results indicate that the predictions of the Talbot-
Plateau law are relatively precise across about seven orders of light 
intensity. Physiological evidence suggests that this is being 
accomplished by mechanisms that counterbalance signals from the 
ON and OFF channels, wherein the degree of departure from an 
average light level determines the degree of activation of each channel.
