Abstract. The existence of the Oseledets decomposition on continuous ly em-
bedded subspaces of Banach spaces is proved in this paper. Na tural assump-
tions facilitating such transfer of the Oseledets decompos ition are presented,
notably conditions often met by dynamical systems generate d by diﬀerential
equations.
Introduction
The primary objective of this work is to delineate natural assumptio ns facilitat-
ing the transfer of the Oseledets decomposition from a Banach spa ce into another
Banach space continuously embedded in the former. In general, th e Oseledets-type
decomposition implies the partitioning/splitting (in the form of a direct sum) of the
ﬁber space, within which a dynamical system operates, into ﬁnite-d imensional sub-
spaces, potentially an inﬁnite many of them, each corresponding to a speciﬁc Lya-
punov exponent. This process gives rise to a hierarchy of subspac es often referred
to as the Oseledets ﬁltration or ﬂags. Lyapunov exponents hold pa ramount signiﬁ-
cance in the realm of systems dynamics, as they dictate the expone ntial asymptotic
growth rate along trajectories. For results, see, e.g., [ 7,9,10,11,12,16,17,25].
Therearenumerouspapersthat concentrateonthe subject of dynamicalsystems
generated by diﬀerential equations and various phase space deco mpositions; for
instance [ 1,4,5,6,7,8,14,20,21,22,18,19]. In many cases of diﬀerential
equations there is no “natural” phase space. Nonetheless, it appe ars that there is a
scarcity of research papers addressing the topics of regularizat ion and the transfer
of Oseledets-type decomposition. As examples, we can mention her e, ﬁrst, ordinary
orpartialdiﬀerential equationswith delay, asconsideredin[ 15,23,24], and, second,
advection diﬀusion equations and others, as investigated in [ 2]. The paper [ 13] is
also worth mentioning, where the authors discuss the possibility of t ransferring the
Oseledets decomposition to dense subspaces of the ﬁber space wit h separable dual.
The presuppositions of this paper, meaning the requirements set f or the solv-
ing operators and the ﬁber space, are often considerably weaker than the speciﬁc
properties of these (for instance, compactness or separable du al are not necessarily
required). On the other hand, such relaxation of assumptions may lead to new
results. To be precise, decompositions in subspaces (in particular, subspaces with a
ﬁner/strongertopologyareofparticularinterest here) ofBana chspaces(in terms of
scales and continuous embeddings) frequently encountered in rea l-world problems
related to diﬀerential equations, may arise from this approach. To the author’s

knowledge, there are no known theorems allowing the transfer of O seledets decom-
positions to subspaces without assuming the previously mentioned s eparability of
the ﬁber space and/or its dual.
To give a ﬂavor of our results, we formulate now some specializations of our
main results. It is well-known that a linear ordinary diﬀerential equat ion with
delay generates a dynamical system that admits the Oseledets split ting in the ﬁber
spaceLp([−1,0],RN)⊕RN. Thisfollowsfromnicepropertiesofﬁberspaces,suchas
separabilityand reﬂexivity. It is also known that in practice, such eq uations possess
a regularisation property that leads to continuous solutions. Pullba ck technique
allows us to transfer the Oseledets decomposition to more regular s paces (with
ﬁner topology).
1.Preliminaries and definitions
In this section, we will present deﬁnitions of measurable dynamical s ystems,
measurable linear skew-product semidynamical systems, and the O seledets decom-
position.
1.1.Measurable dynamical systems. We write R+for [0,∞). For a metric
spaceSbyB(S) we denote the σ-algebra of Borel subsets of S. A probability
space is a triple (Ω ,F,P), where Ω is a set, Fis aσ-algebra of subsets of Ω, and P
is a probability measure deﬁned for all F∈F. We always assume that the measure
Pis complete.
Ameasurable dynamical system on the probability space (Ω ,F,P) is a (B(R)⊗
F,F)-measurable mapping θ:R×Ω→Ω such that
•θ(0,ω) =ωfor anyω∈Ω,
•θ(t+s,w) =θ(t,θ(s,ω)) for any ω∈Ω andt, s∈R+.
We write θ(t,ω) asθtω. Also, we usually denote measurable dynamical systems by
((Ω,F,P),(θt)t∈R) or simply by ( θt)t∈R.
Ametric dynamical system is a measurable dynamical system ((Ω ,F,P),(θt)t∈R)
such that for each t∈Rthe mapping θt: Ω→Ω isP-preserving (i.e., P(θ−1
t(F)) =
P(F) for any F∈Fandt∈R). A subset Ω′⊂Ω isinvariant ifθt(Ω′) = Ω′for all
t∈R, and the metric dynamical system is said to be ergodicif for any invariant
subsetF∈F, eitherP(F) = 1 or P(F) = 0. Throughout the paper we will assume
thatPis ergodic.
1.2.Measurable linear skew-product semidynamical systems. By amea-
surable linear skew-product semidynamical system orsemiﬂow, Φ = ((Uω(t))ω∈Ω,t∈R+,
(θt)t∈R)onXcoveringametricdynamicalsystem( θt)t∈Rweunderstanda( B(R+)⊗

satisfying
Uω(0) = Id X for each ω∈Ω,
Uθsω(t)◦Uω(s) =Uω(t+s) for each ω∈Ω andt, s∈R+,(1.1)
[X∋u/mapsto→Uω(t)u∈X]∈ L(X) for each ω∈Ω andt∈R+.
Equation ( 1.1) is called the cocycle property.OSELEDETS DECOMPOSITION ON SUB SEMIFLOWS 3
By thepositive semiorbit passing through ( ω,u)∈Ω×Xwe understand a
(B([0,∞)),B(X))-measurable mapping

Anegative semiorbit passing through ( ω,u)∈Ω×Xis a (B((−∞,0]),B(X))-mea-
surable mapping ˜ u: (−∞,0]→Xsuch that
•˜u(0) =u;
•˜u(s+t) =Uθsω(t)˜u(s) for each s≤0,t≥0 such that s+t≤0.
By afullorentireorbit passing through ( ω,u)∈Ω×Xwe understand a ( B(R),
B(X))-measurable mapping u:R→Xsuch that
•˜u(0) =u;
•˜u(s+t) =Uθsω˜u(s) for each s∈Randt≥0.
From now on, we will focus on separable Banach spaces. Furthermo re, based on
the results from [ 17, Lemma 5.6 and Corollary 7.3], we will refrain from discussing
measurabilityin theGrassmaniansenseinfavorofanequivalentdeﬁn itionofamea-
surable basis. Let Ω 0∈F. A family {E(ω)}ω∈Ω0ofl-dimensional vector subspaces
ofXismeasurable if there are ( F,B(X))-measurable functions v1,...,v l: Ω0→X
such that ( v1(ω),...,v l(ω)) forms a basis of E(ω) for each ω∈Ω0.
Let{E(ω)}ω∈Ω0be a family of l-dimensional vector subspaces of X, and let
{F(ω)}ω∈Ω0be a family of l-codimensional closed vector subspaces of X, such that
E(ω)⊕F(ω) =Xfor allω∈Ω0. We deﬁne the family of projections associated
with the decomposition E(ω)⊕F(ω) =Xas{P(ω)}ω∈Ω0, whereP(ω) is the linear
projection of XontoF(ω) alongE(ω), for each ω∈Ω0.
The family of projectionsassociated with the decomposition E(ω)⊕F(ω) =Xis
calledstrongly measurable if for each u∈Xthe mapping [Ω 0∋ω/mapsto→P(ω)u∈X]
is (F,B(X))-measurable.
We say that the decomposition E(ω)⊕F(ω) =X, with{E(ω)}ω∈Ω0ﬁnite-di-
mensional, is invariant if Ω0is invariant, Uω(t)E(ω) =E(θtω) andUω(t)F(ω)⊂
F(θtω), for each t∈R+.
A strongly measurable family of projections associated with the inva riant de-
composition E(ω)⊕F(ω) =Xis referred to as tempered if

ω(t))ω∈Ω,t∈R+,(θt)t∈R)
be measurable linear skew-product semidynamical systems on Bana ch spaces
(X1,/bardbl·/bardbl1) and (X2,/bardbl·/bardbl2) respectively. The operator norm on L(Xm,Xn),m,n=
1,2, will be denoted by /bardbl·/bardblm,n. ByLs(Xm,Xn) we understood the space of linear
bounded operators equipped with strong operator topology.
We assume:
(A1)There is an injective bounded linear map i:X2→X1.
(A2)For anyω∈Ω andt≥0 the equality U(1)
ω(t)◦i=i◦U(2)
ω(t) holds.
(A3)For any ω∈Ω there is a map U(1,2)
ω(1)∈ L(X1,X2) such that U(1)
ω(1) =
i◦U(1,2)
ω(1) and U(2)
ω(1) =U(1,2)
ω(1)◦i. Moreover, the operator norm
bound/bardblU(1,2)
ω(1)/bardbl1,2is uniform on ω, i.e., there exists M >0 such that for
allω∈Ω the inequality /bardblU(1,2)
ω(1)/bardbl1,2≤Mholds.
(A4)The operator is U(1,2)
ω(1) is (F,B(Ls(X1,X2)))-measurable i.e., for all u∈
X1the mapping
/bracketleftbig

ω(1)u∈X2/bracketrightbig
is (F,B(X2))-measurable .
(A5)X1andX2are separable.
(A6)For anyA∈B(X2) there exists B∈B(X1) such that A=i−1(B).

holds.6 MAREK KRYSPIN
Proof.Fixωandt. We are going to use the assumptions ( A2) and (A3). Moreover,
sinceiis injective it suﬃces to observe that
i◦U(1,2)
θt−1ω(1)◦U(1)
ω(t−1) =U(1)
θt−1ω(1)◦U(1)

ω(1)∈ L(X2,X1).
Before we investigate how to transfer Oseledets decomposition fr om one measur-
able linear skew-product semidynamical systems Φ(1)onto another semiﬂow Φ(2),
we will introduce a useful Claim.
Claim 1. Assume (A1),(A2),(A3)and letΩ0∈Fbe such that P(Ω0) = 1. For
any family of subspaces {W(ω)}ω∈Ω0ofX1such that the equality U(1)
ω(t)W(ω) =
W(θtω)holds for all t≥0and allω∈Ω0there exists a family of subspaces
{V(ω)}ω∈Ω0ofX2such
(i)iV(ω) =W(ω)for anyω∈Ω0,
(ii)U(2)
ω(t)V(ω) =V(θtω)for allt≥0andω∈Ω0.
Proof.Forω∈Ω0letV(ω):=U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)W(θ−1ω). Therefore,
iV(ω) =i◦U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)W(θ−1ω) =U(1)
θ−1ω(1)W(θ−1ω) =W(ω),
and the part ( i) is done. Furthermore, for ﬁxed t≥0 we have
i◦U(2)
ω(t)V(ω) =i◦U(2)
ω(t)◦U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)W(θ−1ω)
=U(1)
ω(t)◦i◦U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)W(θ−1ω)
=U(1)
ω(t)◦U(1)
θ−1ω(1)W(θ−1ω)
=U(1)
θt−1ω(1)◦U(1)
θ−1ω(t)W(θ−1ω)
=U(1)
θt−1ω(1)W(θt−1ω)
=i◦U(1,2)
θt−1ω(1)W(θt−1ω)
=i◦U(1,2)
θ−1θtω(1)W(θ−1θtω)
=iV(θtω),
which concludes the proof. /square
It should be noted that V(ω) can be deﬁned as i−1(W(ω)). In sucha case, ﬁrstly,
we can observe that by invariance of W(ω) and the assumption ( A3) we have
W(θtω) =U(1)
θt−1ω(1)W(θt−1ω) =i◦U(1,2)
ω(1)W(θt−1ω)⊂iX2.OSELEDETS DECOMPOSITION ON SUB SEMIFLOWS 7
Hence, by proceeding as in the proof of Claim 1we can show invariance of V(ω).
Indeed,
i◦U(2)
ω(t)V(ω) =i◦U(2)
ω(t)i−1(W(ω))
=U(1)
ω(t)◦i(i−1(W(ω)))
=U(1)
ω(t)(W(ω)∩iX2)
=U(1)
ω(t)W(ω)
=W(θtω)
=W(θtω)∩iX2
=i(i−1W(θtω)).
Assume that Φ(1)admits an Oseledets decomposition. By taking in Claim 1
{E(1)
j(ω)}ω∈Ω0,j=1,...,kor{E(1)
j(ω)}ω∈Ω0,j∈Nfor{W(ω)}we obtain families
{E(2)
j(ω)}ω∈Ω0,j=1,...,kor{E(2)
j(ω)}ω∈Ω0,j∈Nof invariant, ﬁnite-dimensional vector
subspaces of X2.
Fixj. Letlbe the dimension of E(1)
j. Forω∈Ω0denote by G(ω) the linear
isomorphism from E(1)
j(ω) ontoRlgiven by G(ω)u:= (α1,...,α l) where u=
α1v1(ω)+...+αlvl(ω) is written in the basis. The family {/hatwideUω(1)}ω∈Ω0of linear
automorphisms of Rldeﬁned by
/hatwideUω(1):=G(θ1ω)◦U(1)
ω(1)↾E(1)
j(ω)◦G(ω)−1, ω∈Ω0,
generates a two-sided discrete-time linear skew-product dynamic al system /hatwideΦ =
((/hatwideUω(n)),(θn)) on Ω 0×Rl, with
/hatwideUω(n):=G(θnω)◦U(1)
ω(n)↾E(1)
j(ω)◦G(ω)−1, ω∈Ω0, n∈N.
This allows us to use results in [ 26, Subsection 4.2.4]. Indeed, those results are
formulated for discrete time, but assumption ( E1) allows us to extend them to the
continuous time case. As a consequence of [ 26, Proposition 4.11],

Based on the above, we can introduce the following lemma, which will pr ove to be
useful in the subsequent analysis.
Lemma 2.3. ForP-a.e.ω∈Ωand each j, there exists a function c: (1,∞)→

Hence, part ( i) is trivially satisﬁed. For part ( ii) observe that the upper bound for
cis obviously /bardbli/bardbl. Therefore, we are concentrating on the sub-exponential lower
limit. It is claimed that

Theorem 2.1. Assume(A1)-(A6)and moreover, that Φ(1)admits an Oseledets de-
composition in case (O1) (or(O2)). ThenΦ(2)admits an Oseledets decomposition
in case(O1) (or(O2)respectively ).
Proof.We are going to show that if Φ(1)admits an Oseledets decomposition in
case (O1) with parameters
(Ω0,(λj)j=1,...,k,{Ej(ω)}ω∈Ω0,j=1,...,k,{F∞(ω)}ω∈Ω0)
then Φ(2)admits an Oseledets decomposition in case ( O1) with parameters
(Ω0,(λj)j=1,...,k,{U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)Ej(θ−1ω)}ω∈Ω0,j=1,...,k,{i−1(F∞(ω))}ω∈Ω0).
Before we start with cases ( i)-(vi). Note that i−1(F∞(ω)) is a closed subspace as
a continuous preimage of a closed subspace. Moreover, for each j= 1,...,kthe
family{U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)Ej(θ−1ω)}ω∈Ω0is measurable. Indeed, the mapping
/bracketleftbig
Ej(ω)∋u/mapsto→U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)u∈U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)Ej(θ−1ω)/bracketrightbig
is a bijection. It follows from the observation that U(1)
ω(1) is a bijection since
it preserves ﬁnite dimension i.e., dim U(1)
ω(1)Ej(ω) = dim Ej(θ1ω) (see (O1)(i)).
Therefore, from: the injectivity of i, the bijectivity of U(1)

wherev1,...,v l: Ω0→Xare (F,B(X))-measurable functions, such that ( v1(ω),

Hence, the decomposition is invariant.

θ−1ω(1)El(θ−1ω)
and setB∈B(X1) is the set from the assumption ( A6) such that A=i−1(B).
It remains to show that the family of projections associated with th e decomposi-
tion (2.2) is tempered. The deﬁnition refers to projections onto the ﬁnite c odimen-
sional closed vector subspaces F(ω). However, it is a well-known fact that it is
suﬃcient to equivalently demonstrate the temperedness of proje ctions onto ﬁnite-
dimensional vector subspaces (i.e. ﬁrst component of ( 2.2), see [15, Remark 2.1]).
We start by demonstrating that the projections onto U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)Ej(θ−1ω) for any
j= 1,...,kare tempered. Let us ﬁx j. Subsequently, in the inductive process,
we will show that temperedness holds universally. Therefore, let /tildewideP(2)
j(ω) denote
the complementary part of P(2)
j(ω), namely the projection onto U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)Ej(θ−1ω).
Using the results from Lemma 2.3, we can conclude that for any u∈X2we have
c(t)/bardbl/tildewideP(2)
j(θtω)u/bardbl2≤ /bardbli/tildewideP(2)(θtω)u/bardbl1≤ /bardbli/bardbl2,1/bardbl/tildewideP(2)
j(θtω)u/bardbl2.
In fact, we have

orem, when t→ −∞, we can obtain ln /bardbl/tildewideP(2)(θtω)/bardbl2,2/t→0 as well, see [ 11, Lemma
C2]. In conclusion, let us observe that generally for the projection /tildewideP(2)

the ﬁrst component of ( 2.2) we have

Moreover, we have two inequalities, ﬁrst one from the assumption ( A2):/bardblU(1)

ω(t−1)◦iu/bardbl1, from the fact that U(2)

Thus, we have proven ( O1)(iv) for Φ(2).
(O1)(v) Fixωand
u(2)∈k/circleplusdisplay
m=jU(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)Em(θ−1ω)⊕i−1(F∞(ω)).
To begin with, let us note that Claim 1allows for demonstrating only the equiv-
alence between the existence of negative semiorbits (in X1andX2) on which the
appropriate Lyapunov exponent is achieved, since the membership ofu(2)in the
subspace U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)Ej(θ−1ω)isequivalenttothe membershipof iu(2)inthesubspace
Ej(ω).
Assume that there exists a negative semiorbit ˜ u(2)(s) inX2passing through
(ω,u(2)). We commence by demonstrating that within the space X1, there exists a
negative semiorbit passing through ( ω,iu(2)), such that the appropriate Lyapunov
exponentisattainable. Namely, wedeﬁne ˜ u(1): (−∞,0]→X1by ˜u(1)(s) =i˜u(2)(s);
such Lyapunov exponent in X2is (by assumption) λj. Upon examination, it be-
comes evident that the thus-deﬁned ˜ u(1)indeed is a negative semi-orbit. Indeed
˜u(1)(0) =iu(2)and
˜u(1)(s+t) =i˜u(2)(s+t) =iU(2)
θsω(t)˜u(2)(s) =U(1)
θsω(t)i˜u(2)(s) =U(1)
θsω(t)˜u(1)(s).
Moreover, ˜ u(1)is (B((−∞,0]),B(X1))-measurable as a continuous composition.
Furthermore, ln /bardbl˜u(1)(s)/bardbl1/s→λjass→ −∞since
/bardbl˜u(2)(s+1)/bardbl2=/bardblU(1,2)
θsω(1)i˜u(2)(s)/bardbl2
≤ /bardblU(1,2)
θsω(1)/bardbl1,2/bardbli˜u(2)(s)/bardbl1=/bardblU(1,2)
θsω(1)/bardbl1,2/bardbl˜u(1)(s)/bardbl1
≤ /bardblU(1,2)
θsω(1)/bardbl1,2/bardbli/bardbl2,1/bardbl˜u(2)(s)/bardbl2.
Conversely, if ˜ u(1)is a negative semiorbit on X1, then ˜u(2)deﬁned as ˜ u(2)(s) =
U(1,2)
θs−1ω(1)˜u(1)(s−1) serves as a negative semiorbit on X2. Clearly,
i˜u(2)(0) =iU(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)˜u(1)(−1) =U(1)
θ−1ω(1)˜u(1)(−1) = ˜u(1)(0) =u(1)=iu(2),12 MAREK KRYSPIN
and for any s≤0,t≥0 such that s+t≤0 we have
˜u(2)(s+t) =U(1,2)
θs−1+tω(1)˜u(1)(s−1+t)
=U(1,2)

θsω(t)◦U(1,2)

θsω(t)˜u(2)(s).
Moreover, ln /bardbl˜u(2)(s)/bardbl2/s→λjass→ −∞since
/bardbl˜u(1)(s)/bardbl1≤ /bardbli/bardbl2,1/bardbl˜u(2)(s)/bardbl2≤ /bardbli/bardbl2,1/bardblU(1,2)

It remains to show the ( B((−∞,0]),B(X2))-measurability of the map
/bracketleftbig
(−∞,0]∋s/mapsto→U(1,2)
θs−1ω(1)˜u(1)(s−1)∈X2/bracketrightbig
.
For this purpose, let us observe that it can be rewritten as the mea surable compo-
sition
s/mapsto→(θs−1ω,s)/mapsto→(U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1),˜u(1)(s−1))/mapsto→U(1,2)
θs−1ω(1)˜u(1)(s−1).
Theﬁrstmappingis( B((−∞,0]),F⊗B((−∞,0]))-measurable,thesecondmapping
is (F⊗B((−∞,0]),B(Ls(X1,X2))⊗B(X1))-measurable. By the assumption ( A5)
and Lemma 2.1, the pairing is ( B(Ls(X1,X2))⊗B(X1),B(X2))-measurable.
(O1)(vi) Firstly, we claim that
U(2)
ω(t) =U(1,2)
θt−1ω(1)◦U(1)
ω(t−1)◦i.
Together with i(i−1(F∞(ω)))⊂F∞(ω) we can see that the inequality
/bardblU(2)
ω(t)↾i−1(F∞(ω))/bardbl2,2≤ /bardbli/bardbl2,1/bardblU(1,2)
θt−1ω(1)/bardbl1,2/bardblU(1)

θt−1ω(1)/bardbl1,2/bardblU(1)

holds for any ω∈Ω andt≥1. So,

tln/bardblU(1)
ω(t−1)↾F∞(ω)/bardbl1,1,
with under assumptions ( A1) and (A3) suﬃces to ﬁnish the proof of this part.
Furthermore, we have concluded the ﬁrst and, as it turns out, th e main part of
the proof. The remaining part ( O2) pertains to the scenario in which there is a
countable number of Lyapunov exponents. Nevertheless, it is eas y to notice that
practically the entire proof is replicated word for word in this situatio n. However,
for the sake of completeness, let us note the fact that if Φ(1)admits Oseledets
decomposition in the case ( O2) with parameters
(Ω0,(λj)j∈N,{Ej(ω)}ω∈Ω0,j∈N,{Fj(ω)}ω∈Ω0,j∈N)
then Φ(2)also admits Oseledets decomposition in the case ( O2), with parameters
(Ω0,(λj)j∈N,{U(1,2)
θ−1ω(1)Ej(θ−1ω)}ω∈Ω0,j∈N,{i−1(Fj(ω))}ω∈Ω0,j∈N).

Assumption discussion
In this section, we aim to discuss the scenario where assumption ( A6) is met.
Indeed, wewill showsomething more, namelythat this assumptionis f ulﬁlled when,
in particular, X1=Lp([−1,0]) (1< p <∞) andX2=C([−1,0]), and that
measurability of function factors follows from it.
Lemma 2.4. Leti:C([−1,0])→Lp([−1,0])be the continuous injection deﬁned by
i(f) =f. Moreover, let w(1): Ω→Lp([−1,0])be a(F,B(Lp([−1,0])))-measurable
function with the factor w(2): Ω→C([−1,0]), i.e.w(1)=i◦w(2). Thenw(2):
Ω→C([−1,0])is(F,B(C([−1,0])))-measurable.
Proof.The proof is based on observation that every closed ball, speciﬁcally the
unit ball, in C([−1,0]) corresponds to a pre-image of iof some Lp-closed subset
F⊂Lp([−1,0]), i.e. ¯BC([−1,0])(0,1) =i−1(F) for some Lp-closedF. The set
F:={i(f)∈Lp([−1,0]) :−1≤f(x)≤1 for a.e. x∈[−1,0]}proves to be a
witness, as Lp([−1,0])\FisLp-open. Indeed, for g∈Lp([−1,0])\Fthere exists
a Lebesgue-measurable set M⊂[−1,0] such that its Lebesgue measure λ(M)>0
andǫ >0 such that g(x)≥1 +ǫfor allx∈M. Therefore, for f∈Fwe have
/bardblg−f/bardblLp≥ǫλ1/p(M) soBLp(−1,0)(g,ǫλ1/p(M))⊂Lp([−1,0])\F. It remains to
showi−1(F) =¯BC([−1,0])(0,1). However, it can be easily done via deﬁnition of
pre-image since, conditions −1≤f(x)≤1 for a.e. xand−1≤f(x)≤1 for all x
are equivalent for continuous functions.
Asaﬁnalstep,wedemonstratethatthemap w(2)is(F,B(C([−1,0])))-measurable.
LetDbe an open subset of C([−1,0]) in the sense of the C([−1,0]) topology. Since
C([−1,0]) is separable, it has a countable base, and Dcan be expressed as a count-
able union of open balls. Moreover, open balls can be written as count able union
of closed ones. As a consequence the set Dis a countable union of pre-images of
Lp-closed sets. The observation that
(w(2))−1[D] = (w(2))−1/parenleftBig/uniondisplay
