We study an inflation model with a flat scalar potential supported by observations and find that
slow-roll inflation can emerge after a quasi-cyclic phase of the Universe, where it undergoes repeated
expansions and contractions for a finite time period. The initial conditions and the positive spatial
curvature required for such nontrivial dynamics align with the quantum creation of the Universe. The
key ingredients that trigger inflation are dissipative interactions of the inflaton, which are necessary
to reheat the Universe after inflation and thus give us an observational handle on pre-inflationary
physics. Our discovery implies that inflation occurs more robustly after the creation.
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the fundamental questions in nature is the origin
of the Universe. The discovery of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) [ 1] established the big bang cosmol-
ogy, whose problems (horizon, flatness, monopole puzzles)
were solved in the cosmic inflation paradigm, in which
the primordial Universe experiences a period of nearly
exponential expansion [ 2–7]. Quantum fluctuations of the
inflaton, the scalar field driving inflation, serve as seeds
for the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. Its
simplest version, i.e., the single-field slow-roll inflation
scenario is consistent with cosmological observations of
CMB [ 8,9] and LSS [ 10]. Alternatives to inflation include
bounce cosmology, in which a contracting Universe tran-
sitions into an expansion phase, and cyclic cosmology,1
in which the Universe undergoes repeated expansion and
unlimited contraction (see reviews [ 12–14]). A more am-
bitious idea to understand the beginning, if it exists, of
the Universe is quantum creation of the Universe from
“nothing” including the tunneling proposals [ 15–22] and
the no-boundary proposal [ 23–25]. In this letter, we point
out that these diverse ideas coherently merge into a new
consistent picture of the Universe.
In fact, none of the above individually provide us a
fully satisfactory cosmology. Inflation does not necessar-
ily resolve the singularity of the big bang [ 26].2Bounce
cosmology assumes an infinitely large homogeneous con-
tracting universe in the infinite past, which is possible
but not entirely satisfactory, at least to us. The cyclic
Universe is a beautiful idea, but generally conflicts with
the second law of thermodynamics and is unstable (see,
e.g., Ref. [ 31]). For the quantum creation of the Universe
to be predictive, we need to better understand the clas-
sical dynamics that occur after creation. For instance,
1We consider the cyclicity of the scale factor rather than the
Hubble parameter [11].
2Past-incompleteness shown in Ref. [ 26] does not necessarily imply
physical singularity [27–30].sufficiently long inflation immediately after creation is
not necessarily guaranteed, so we need to explore whether
and how our Universe can arise in such cases.
Since the beginning of the Universe is a highly specu-
lative topic with no direct observational evidence, it will
be useful as a first step to incorporate our knowledge
about CMB observables, which suggest inflation models
with a relatively flat potential [ 9]. We study the classical
dynamics of the Universe with such a flat scalar potential
and with the initial conditions and the positive spatial
curvature motivated by the quantum creation of the Uni-
verse. In our previous work with such a setup, we found
homogeneous solutions representing a cyclic or “vibrating”
Universe when the initial inflaton field value is around
the edge of the flat part of the potential [ 32]. This is the
starting point from which creation from nothing, cyclic
cosmology, and inflation will eventually unite.
The first step is to notice the possibility that inflation
might occur because of the instability of the quasi-cyclic
epoch [ 33–38]. In our setup, a plateau-type potential
necessarily has a field region in which tachyonic insta-
bility occurs. Also, if we assume that inflation occurs
after the quasi-cyclic epoch in some way, the inflaton
must dissipate into other fields and (re)heat the Universe.
Such interactions inevitably participate in the instability
process of the quasi-cyclic epoch. The purpose of this
letter is to study this instability process and whether and
how an inflation phase emerges. We find that dissipa-
tive interactions can turn the quasi-cyclic Universe into
the inflationary Universe before the tachyonic instability
significantly develops for appropriate parameter values.
We do notintroduce modifications of gravity beyond
General Relativity, exotic matter violating the null en-
ergy condition, a negative cosmological constant, negative
Casimir energy, or a singular bounce. Also, our mecha-
nism is based on classical dynamics of the inflaton with
sub-Planckian energy density, and it does not involve
quantum tunneling from the quasi-cyclic period into in-
flation.arXiv:2305.02366v2  [gr-qc]  15 May 20242
II. SETUP
Throughout this letter, we use the natural unit c=ℏ=
8πG= 1. Our action is given by the following Lagrangian
density:
L=1
2R−1
2gµν∂µϕ∂νϕ−V(ϕ) +Lint+Lmatter ,(1)
where Ris the Ricci scalar, gµνthe inverse metric, ϕthe
scalar field we are interested in, V(ϕ) its potential, Lint
the interaction between ϕand other fields, and Lmatter
the Lagrangian density for the other fields. As a concrete
example, we consider the potential [39]
V(ϕ) =V0tanh2ϕ
ϕ0
, (2)
where V0is the overall scale of the potential and ϕ0char-
acterizes the width of the valley of the potential. This
type of potential can be obtained, e.g., after switching
to the Einstein frame and/or canonical normalization if
the original model possesses an approximate scale invari-
ance [ 2,40–42]. The shift symmetry of ϕcan be protected
from quantum corrections [ 43]. If inflation successfully
occurs, this potential leads to inflationary observables
consistent with the CMB data such as
As=N2
eV0
3π2ϕ2
0, n s=1−2
Ne, r =2ϕ2
0
N2e,(3)
where As,ns,r, and Neare the amplitude of the pri-
mordial curvature perturbations, the spectral index, the
tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the e-folding number between
the horizon exit of the CMB pivot scale and the end of
inflation.
We assume homogeneity and isotropy of the Uni-
verse and take the Friedmann-Lemaˆ ıtre-Robertson-Walker
ansatz for the metric
ds2=−dt2+a(t)2dr2
1−Kr2+r2dΩ2
2
, (4)
where a(t) is the scale factor of the Universe, K(>0)
is the positive spatial curvature representing the closed
topology of the Universe created from nothing, and dΩ2
2
is the line element for the two-dimensional unit sphere.
We adopt the initial condition motivated by the quan-
tum creation of the Universe [22]
a(0) =s
3K
V(ϕ(0)), ˙a(0) =0 , ˙ϕ(0) =0 ,(5)
with the homogeneous field value ϕ(0) satisfying |V′|≲V,
where a dot and a prime denote a derivative with respect
to time tandϕ, respectively. Kcan be fixed to an
arbitrary positive value by rescaling a.
When the scalar field is initially on the plateau, suf-
ficiently long inflation is possible. In this letter, we are
interested in more subtle cases in which the scalar fieldis initially around the edge of the plateau. In this case,
there are cyclic solutions at the homogeneous level [ 32].
One reason why this simple setup with a single scalar
field leads to cyclic solutions is that its field-dependent
equation-of-state parameter w=P/ρwith Pandρbe-
ing pressure and energy density gives rise to a feedback
mechanism [32].
III. EMERGENCE OF INFLATION
To reheat the Universe, the inflaton must dissipate its
energy into other, possibly light and relativistic, degrees
of freedom. Details of this depend on LintandLmatter ,
but we model them by the following Friedmann and Boltz-
mann equations:
˙H=−1
2˙ϕ2−2
3ρr+K
a2, (6)
¨ϕ+ (3H+ Γ) ˙ϕ+V′= 0, (7)
˙ρr+ 4Hρr= Γ˙ϕ2, (8)
where H=˙a/ais the Hubble expansion/contraction rate,
Γ the dissipation rate, and ρrthe energy density of ra-
diation, i.e., relativistic degrees of freedom. We will use
the above simplified equations in our analysis, since our
scenario does not rely on the details of the equations of
motion, but note that it is not always possible to de-
rive this form from the underlying Lagrangian. See, e.g.,
Refs. [ 44–47]. The dissipation rate Γ may depend on the
field value and the temperature if a thermal bath is popu-
lated. The dissipation channel may include decay [ 48,49],
scattering [ 50], thermal friction due to sphaleron tran-
sitions [ 51–57], etc. Interesting multiple cosmological
roles and underlying quantum field theoretic origin of Γ
were discussed extensively in the context of warm infla-
tion [ 47,58–61]. We do not restrict the inflation that
emerges (to be shown below) to be warm or cold. It is
possible to realize cold inflation [62].
To illustrate essential points of our mechanism, we
consider a toy model with a constant Γ, whereas we
study a more realistic model in our companion paper [ 62],
where we delineate possible ultraviolet completion of the
models to explain a rather large coupling required for the
mechanism to work.
We use the set of equations of motion above to study
the dynamics just after the creation of the Universe. We
find that inflation longer than 60 e-folding is possible after
undergoing single or multiple bounces depending on the
parameters. Two such examples are shown in Fig. 1. We
have confirmed that qualitatively similar solutions are
obtained even if we multiply Γ with a “window function”
to suppress dissipation when the effective mass of ϕis
negative or small.
The beginning of inflation due to the dissipation ef-
fects is not always guaranteed. If the dissipation rate
is too large or too small, the other generic consequence
after the quasi-cyclic epoch is dominance either by the3

after a quasi-cyclic period. The top panel shows ϕ(t) and
the bottom panel shows the corresponding log plot of a(t).
The solution shown by the thin orange lines ( ϕ0=√
0.006
and Γ /√V0= 0.003) illustrates the beginning of inflation
after the eight bounces, which is too late compared to the
left vertical line showing tfragestimated by CosmoLattice after
fixing V0to fit As. The other solution shown by the thick blue
lines ( ϕ0=√
0.06and Γ /√V0= 0.02) illustrates one bounce

kinetic energy or by radiation and the resultant collapse
of the Universe into the big crunch singularity. In par-
ticular, once the Universe contracts so that the energy
density of ϕexceeds the asymptotic value V0, there is
no longer a chance for a bounce. This also suggests that
sufficiently small shift-symmetry breaking terms can help
the Universe to bounce. Successful parameter values of
Γ are distributed dispersedly corresponding to different
numbers of times of bounces.
These qualitative features do not sensitively depend on
the details of the potential as long as it has a sufficiently
flat part. We have studied other example potentials and
found similar solutions. In particular, the plateau does
not need to be infinitely extended.So far, we have neglected the inhomogeneity of ϕ, but
there is an intrinsic tachyonic instability for any plateau-
type potential. The tachyonic instability turns out to
be so strong that the number of cycles is significantly
limited. When the gradient energy becomes, e.g., 1% of
the initial energy density, the backreaction to the back-
ground becomes non-negligible and ϕwill fragment. This
fragmentation time is estimated as
tfrag≈1
2µpeakln4π3/2×0.01ρ
(kpeak/a)4
, (9)
where µpeakis the maximum exponent of the tachyonic
instability and kpeak/ais the corresponding wave num-
ber [63], both of which are of O(√2V0/ϕ0). The dimen-
sionless fragmentation time tfrag√V0can be extended by
lowering the energy scale V0but only logarithmically.
We estimate tfragmore precisely using the public lattice
calculation tool CosmoLattice [ 64,65] (see the accompany-
ing paper [ 62] for details) where we turn off the dissipation
effects, and the results are shown by the vertical dashed
lines in Fig. 1. We have found a set of parameters con-
sistent with the CMB observations with which inflation
begins before the fragmentation time (the right vertical
lines), which is shown by the thick blue lines, justifying
the above calculations with homogeneity. It may appear
that the inflation barely begins before t=tfragand one
might doubt the validity of the solution. At t=tfrag,
however, ϕhas already reached deep on the plateau, so
the fragmentation cannot occur thereafter and inflation
safely begins. On the other hand, the parameter values
for the thin orange lines are chosen to clearly demonstrate
the quasi-cyclic behavior and are incompatible either with
the CMB normalization or with the bound from tachyonic
instability (the left vertical lines).
The tachyonic instability becomes more severe for
smaller ϕ0since ϕoscillates more in the time scale of
the dynamics of a. Meanwhile, for larger ϕ0, the cyclic
solutions themselves (without dissipation effects) require
more fine-tuned parameters.3Interestingly, there ex-
ists an allowed window for ϕ0≈0.25, which predicts
r≈4×10−5(Ne/55)−2. In this case, the number of
cycles is limited to one or a few, at most.
IV. EXPLORING THE PARAMETER SPACE
Let us study where in the parameter space
(ϕ0, V0, ϕ(0),Γ) the mechanism works. The two most im-
portant parameters are the location of the plateau ϕ0and
the dissipation rate Γ. The potential height V0rescales
the overall timescale and affects the ratio between tfrag
3ForO(1) values of ϕ0with fine-tuned initial conditions, there
are solutions with inflation after a single or a few bounce(s) even
without dissipation effects [ 32,66]. We see that similar solutions
exist in an yet unexplored parameter space in the next section.4
and the typical time scale of the dynamics of ϕlogarith-
mically. We fix it to fit the CMB normalization. The
initial field value ϕ(0) is also an important factor that
affects the behavior of solutions.
We first study where in the parameter space one finds
cyclic solutions before considering the effects of dissipation
(i.e., Γ = 0). Fig. 2 classifies solutions with different ϕ0
andϕ(0). We set the maximal time tmax= 300 /√V0for
the classification of solutions. In the upper-right corner,
there are inflationary solutions with an e-folding number
(within the simulation time) greater than 50 (yellow)
or smaller than that (green) as expected. Below that,
there are parameter regions that end with a big crunch
(red for ˙ϕ > 0 and purple for ˙ϕ < 0), which is also
not surprising. There are also non-trivial regions in the
parameter space. The sky blue region, located in the lower-
left corner, represents cyclic solutions. The existence of
inflationary solutions (yellow and green) just above the
sky blue region is also remarkable. Unlike the inflationary
solutions around the upper-right corner, inflation occurs
after cosmic bounce(s) in this region. Thus, inflation after
bounce(s) is possible even in the absence of dissipation.
The orange regions (passing through the top-left corner)
represent sufficiently long inflation in the homogeneous
simulation, but the beginning of the inflation is later than
the fragmentation time. Dissipative effects are also useful
for such solutions to trigger inflation earlier.
FIG. 2. Classification of the parameter points without dissi-
pative effects. (1) red, (2) purple, (3) sky blue, (4) green, (5)
orange, and (6) yellow regions denote big crunch with (1) ˙ϕ >0
or (2) ˙ϕ <0, (3) cyclic universes, (4) short ( lna(tmax)/a(0)<
50) inflation, and long ( lna(tmax)/a(0)≥50) inflation (5)
after or (6) before the fragmentation time, respectively. The
figure depends on V0only through the fragmentation time
calculation for the region (5), and V0is fixed to fit the CMB
normalization. The slice of the parameter space shown by the
white line is further studied in Fig. 3. The black line denotes
the place where the first slow-roll parameter is 1.
Next, we take into account the dissipative effects and
study how the solutions are modified. We expect solutionswith larger amplitude ϕ(0) are more susceptible to dissi-
pative effects. Also, the classicality condition |V′|≲V
excludes insufficiently large ϕ(0) (see the black line as a
guide below which the first slow-roll parameter is larger
than 1). For these reasons, let us study a parameter region
near the upper boundary of cyclic phase. For definiteness,
we focus on the slice shown by the white line in Fig. 2:
ϕ(0)/ϕ0= 0.9−1.2 log10ϕ0.
The behavior of the solutions on the ( ϕ0, Γ)-plane is
summarized in Fig. 3 with a similar color coding. The
characteristic stripe structures correspond to the oscilla-
tion phases of ϕat which nontrivial dynamics occur. The
figure shows that there are yellow regions in the parame-
ter space in which sufficiently long inflation occurs before
the would-be fragmentation time. In orange regions, long
inflation occurs in the homogeneous simulation, but it
begins later than the fragmentation time. If we remove
the minimal assumption that this inflation is responsible
for the CMB fluctuations, we can lower V0and increase
the fragmentation time. Then, the orange regions could
become as viable as in the yellow regions.
FIG. 3. Classification of the parameter points. (1) red, (2)
purple, (3) sky blue, (4) green, (5) orange, and (6) yellow
regions denote big crunch with (1) ˙ϕ >0 or (2) ˙ϕ <0, (3) cyclic
universes, (4) short inflation, and long ( lna(tmax)/a(0)≥50)
inflation (5) in the absence of tachyonic instability or (6) even
in its presence, respectively. We choose the value of V0to fit
the CMB normalization and that of ϕ(0) through the relation
ϕ(0)/ϕ0= 0.9−1.2 log10ϕ0(the white line in Fig. 2).
V. REHEATING OF THE UNIVERSE
Once inflation occurs, the spatial curvature is flattened
out and radiation is diluted, so the phenomenology is
the same as the conventional inflationary scenario. An
interesting point in our scenario is that the process of
reheating the Universe is due to the same interactions that
triggered inflation. This gives us a chance to probe the
pre-inflationary physics immediately after the creation of5
the Universe by studying the reheating. This is especially
interesting if the Standard Model fields play an important
role as the radiation ρrin the above equations. If the
radiation consists of the dark/hidden sector beyond the
Standard Model, we need to understand the coupling
between such a sector and the Standard Model sector for
a successful reheating. However, this connection between
the reheating and the quasi-cyclic period, the pre-/post-
inflation duality, is a unique feature in our scenario.
It is also worth noting that the dynamics of ϕbefore
and after inflation are quite different since the spatial
curvature plays a major role in the former case whereas
it is negligible in the latter case. This difference can
also be understood from the impact of the Hubble expan-
sion/contraction rate. Before inflation, it oscillates around
zero, so the physics is closer to that in flat spacetime. On
the other hand, the Hubble friction significantly reduces
the amplitude of ϕafter inflation, so preheating due to self-
interactions is not effective for ϕ0≈0.25 [67]. We have
confirmed this by lattice calculations using CosmoLattice.
VI. PROBABILITY OF INFLATION
So far, we have treated ϕ(0) as a free parameter. Its
probability distribution P(ϕ(0)) is determined by the wave
function of the Universe and has the following exponential
dependence [22]
P(ϕ(0))∼exp
±24π2
V(ϕ(0))
, (10)
where the plus (minus) sign corresponds to the no-
boundary (tunneling) proposal. The most probable out-
comes crucially depend on the sign, and this ambiguity
has been a long-standing controversy in quantum cosmol-
ogy [21, 22, 24].
Our study does not contribute to the theoretical res-
olution of the controversy, and we have nothing to say
about the tunneling proposal since long-lasting inflation
can easily occur. On the other hand, if the wave func-
tion of our Universe is close to that predicted by the
no-boundary proposal, our solutions have a potentially
significant impact. It has long been thought that the
potential like Eq. (2)most probably does not lead to
long-lasting inflation for the no-boundary proposal [ 22]
since a smaller V(ϕ(0)) is more favored probabilistically.
However, this statement must be reconsidered. Since the
probability (10)is derived by assuming the flatness con-
dition on the potential, let us exclude the field range of
ϕthat does not satisfy the condition. The probability
formula then tells us that the initial value of ϕis expo-
nentially more probable to be at the edge of the plateau
where the flatness condition is barely satisfied [ 68]. Aconventional expectation in such a case is that inflation
is too short and the Universe is supposed to end with the
big crunch singularity. Our solutions show that this fate
can be avoided by transitioning into inflation.
Still, we cannot conclude that such nontrivial dynamics
are the most probable outcome in our model setup once
we introduce the observed small positive cosmological
constant Λ [ 8,69]. In the no-boundary proposal, nucle-
ation of a universe at the global minimum V(ϕ(0)) = Λ
is exponentially more probable. If such a low-energy uni-
verse were created directly from nothing, it would be an
empty universe with no galaxies and no observers. Given
the present Universe with galaxies and our existence, we
may focus on the universes undergoing long-lasting infla-
tion, which corresponds to thinking about the conditional
probability. Combining our solutions with this anthropic
argument implies that the past of our inflationary Uni-
verse in the no-boundary proposal is most probably the
quasi-cyclic period.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
We have found cosmological inflationary solutions in
which the interactions that cause the reheating of the
Universe after inflation are also responsible for dissipation
to start inflation out of a quasi-cyclic epoch just after
the quantum creation of the Universe from nothing. One
prediction of the scenario is positive spatial curvature.
The connection between the pre- and post-inflationary
periods can, in principle, help us experimentally and
observationally probe the origin of our Universe.
