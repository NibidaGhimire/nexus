In principle, the local cosmic void can be simply modeled by the spherically symmetric Lemaitre-
Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric. In practice, the real local cosmic void is probably not spherically
symmetric. In this paper, to reconstruct a more realistic profile of the local cosmic void, we divide
it into several segments. Each segment with certain solid angle is modeled by its own LTB metric.
Meanwhile, we divide the 1048 type Ia supernovae (SNIa) of the Pantheon Survey into corresponding
subsets according to their distribution in the galactic coordinate system. Obviously, each SNIa
subset can only be used to reconstruct the profile of one segment. Finally, we can patch together an
irregular profile for the local cosmic void with the whole Pantheon sample. Note that, the paucity
of each data subset lead us to focus on the inner part of each void segment and assume that the
half radii of the void segments are sufficient to constrain the whole segment. We find that, despite
2σsignals of anisotropy limited to the depth of the void segments, the constraints on every void
segment are consistent with ΛCDM model at 95% CL. Moreover, our constraints are too weak to
challenge the cosmic homogeneity and isotropy.
I. INTRODUCTION
The cosmological principle assumes that the universe
is homogeneous and isotropic on cosmic scales. Based
on this assumption as well as the standard model of par-
ticle physics and Einstein’s general relativity (GR), the
Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model is proposed.
This standard model of cosmology has proved successful
on large cosmic scales according to the latest cosmic mi-
crowave background (CMB) observations, namely Planck
2018 data [1], DES [2] or eBOSS [3]. However, it faces
major challenges on small scales, such as the Hubble ten-
sion [4], the σ8tension [5–7] and the dipolar tension [8].
Besides GR, dark energy model or treatments of system-
atic uncertainty, the former tension also challenges the
local cosmic homogeneity and the latter one challenges
as well the cosmic isotropy on small scales. Therefore,
further testing of the local cosmic inhomogeneity and
anisotropy on small scales is necessary.
The local cosmic inhomogeneity can be modeled by the
spherically symmetric Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB)
metric [9–11]. Considering the late-time matter and dark
energy, we can use it as an inhomogeneous generalisation
of a ΛCDM model, namely as a ΛLTB model. Using the
combination of the latest available cosmological observa-
tions, the local radial inhomogeneity in the ΛLTB model
has been probed [12, 13]. Even though a deeper local
void can reconcile the Hubble tension [14] and a larger

‡(delliou@lzu.edu.cn,)morgan.ledelliou.ift@gmail.comlocal void can reconcile the dipolar tension [15], a shal-
lower and smaller local void is favored by the combination
of the latest available cosmological observations [12, 13].
However, a spherically symmetric local cosmic inhomo-
geneity may not meet reality. Therefore, in this paper,
we will probe the true profile of the local cosmic inhomo-
geneity as realistically as possible.
The cosmic anisotropy on small scales can be tested by
type Ia supernovae (SNIa) data, such as the combined
Pantheon sample [16]. One straightforward method is to
divide the whole samples into several subsets according
to the distribution of individual SNIa in the galactic co-
ordinate system. In particular, the hemisphere compar-
ison method [17, 18] divides the whole sample into two
data subsets which are designated as the “up” and the
“down” hemispheres, respectively [19–21]. Furthermore,
HEALPix [22] can be used to divide the whole sample into
more data subsets [21, 23, 24]. Another common method
is the dipole fitting method [25], which assumes a priori
the existence of a dipole in the cosmic anisotropy on small
scales [19–21, 26, 27]. Until now, there is no evidence for
cosmic anisotropy on small scales in the SNIa samples.
However, these null signals are just obtained from overall
constraints and may neglect some fine structures in the
universe.
In this paper, we try to test both of the local cosmic
inhomogeneity and the cosmic anisotropy on small scales
at the same time using the SNIa data of Pantheon. To
account for the asymmetry in the local cosmic inhomo-
geneity and the fine structures in the cosmic anisotropy
on small scales, we will fit cosmic anisotropy on small
scales with the ΛLTB model. We first divide the local
cosmic void into several segments. Each segment with
given solid angle is fitted to its own LTB metric, wherearXiv:2304.13945v2  [astro-ph.CO]  20 Sep 20232
the void depth and radius parameters only correspond
to the local segment and ignore the data from the other
segments. We then divide the 1048 SNIa of Pantheon
into corresponding subsets according to their distribu-
tion in the galactic coordinate system. Obviously, each
SNIa subset can only be used to reconstruct the profile of
one segment. Finally, we can patch together an irregular
profile for the local cosmic void with the whole Pantheon
sample. The whole profile will contain all the informa-
tion about both of the local cosmic inhomogeneity and
the cosmic anisotropy on small scales, as shown in Fig. 1.
This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we
present our method modeling the local cosmic inhomo-
geneity and introduce our treatment of the Pantheon
data. In section III, we show the constraints on the pro-
files of all segments of the local cosmic inhomogeneity and
compare them. Finally, a brief summary and discussions
are included in section IV.
II. METHODOLOGY AND DATA
A. Model
A spherically symmetric void can be modeled by the
LTB metric
ds2=−dt2+R′2(r, t)
1 + 2 r2k(r)˜M2dr2+R2(r, t)dΩ,(1)
where dΩ =dθ2+sin2θdϕ2,˜Mis an arbitrary mass scale,
k(r) is an arbitrary curvature profile function, R(r, t) =
a(t)ris dependent on the FLRW scale factor a(t) and
a prime (or dot) denotes derivative with respect to the
radial coordinate r(or the time t). As ΛCDM model
is built on the FLRW metric, there is a ΛLTB model
built on the LTB metric. The universe’s expansion in the
ΛLTB model is determined by a Friedmann-like equation
˙R2(r, t)
R2(r, t)=2m(r)
R3(r, t)+2r2k(r)˜M2
R2(r, t)+Λ
3, (2)
where m(r) is the so-called Euclidean mass function1and
be set as m(r) = 4 π˜M2r3/3, the Big Bang time tBB(r) is
fixed as a constant and the curvature profile k(r) is the
only free function to determine the void. More precisely,
the void’s expansion can be decomposed into a transverse
expansion rate and a longitudinal expansion rate. The
former one depends on a transverse scale factor a⊥(r, t) =
R(r, t)/ras
H⊥(r, t) =˙a⊥(r, t)
a⊥(r, t); (3)

factor a∥(r, t) =R′(r, t) as
H∥(r, t) =˙a∥(r, t)
a∥(r, t). (4)
According to the above Friedmann-like equation, we can
define the density parameters of matter, curvature and
dark energy today as
Ωm(r) =2m(r)
R3(r, t0)H2
⊥(r, t0), (5)
Ωk(r) =2r2k(r)˜M2
R2(r, t0)H2
⊥(r, t0), (6)
ΩΛ(r) =Λ
3H2
⊥(r, t0). (7)
The profile of the void can be parameterized by the
depth, size, and boundary width of the void [28]. In fact,
the depth and size of the void are sufficient to constrain it
and the width of the void boundary can be ignored [29].
We thus parameterise the void with the following curva-
ture profile
k(r) =kcP3(r), (8)
Pn(r) =(
1−exph
−(1−r/rB)n
r/rBi
0≤r < r B
0 rB≤r,(9)
where we have assumed the universe is flat outside the
void, kcis the curvature at the center and rBis the co-
moving radius of the void.
If the void is spherically symmetric and all the lat-
est cosmological observations are available, the profile at
rcan be constrained by data from any direction or sky
location. Therefore, the depth of the void and the bound-
ary of the void in particular, where the curvature reaches
0, can be constrained relatively well [12]. If the asymme-
try of the void is only probed with SNIa data, however,
we find that although the depth of the void can still be
constrained relatively well, this is not the case for the
boundary of the void, where the curvature changes to 0.
Therefore, we introduce a scale rCwhere the curvature
changes by 10%. That is to say, we will not attempt to
characterise the whole void but conservatively concen-
trate on the partial profile of the inner void, replacing
Eq. (9) with the following function:

code. kcis related to ˜δ0=˜δ(r= 0, t0), where the inte-

FIG. 1: The diagram of an irregular local cosmic void. Each segment with the same solid angle πis modeled by its
own LTB metric and constrained by the corresponding SNIa subset given in Tab. I. Different specific solid angle
LTB segments calibrated on data from that angle allow to capture anisotropic fine structures, contrary to previous
isotropic studies [12, 13]. Those studies’ spherical symmetry assumption restriction might have washed away a weak
signal from some fine structures. Such signal would favor the ΛLTB model over the ΛCDM model.
where “out” denotes the corresponding FLRW quantities.
Because −1≤˜δ0<∞is not good for the convergence of
the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC), we will use a
new parameter
δ0=˜δ0˜δ0≤0
˜δ0/(1 + ˜δ0)˜δ0>0. (12)
As for the two radii {rB, rC}, we will relate them to their
corresponding redshifts by rB=r(zB) and rC=r(zC),
where r(z) satisfies the geodesic equations

As mentioned before, the information about the whole
void is out of reach of SNIa data. As we probe the cen-
tral part of the void with an evaluated rCand consider
the unknown boundary to be far, but not extremely far,
from that limit, we therefore further relate rBtorCas
rB= 2rC. That is to say, we will only conservatively
concentrate on the profile of the void where z≤zC,
while the profile of the void where zC< z≤zBis set
by our assumption rB= 2rC. Moreover, as zB>0
is meaningless when δ0∼0, we relate zBto|δ0|by afree parameter |zB/δ0|which will proceed from a uni-
form prior distribution |zB/δ0| ∈[0,100]. The remaining
free parameter δ0will have a uniform prior distribution
δ0∈[−0.99,0.99]. We finally can use the dependence of
SNIa’s luminosity distance on these two synthetic void
parameters {δ0, zB=|δ0| × |zB/δ0|}to probe the profile
of the void, where the angular diameter distance dAand
the luminosity distance dLare obtained from
dA(z;δ0, zB) =R(r(z), t(z);δ0, zB), (15)
dL(z;δ0, zB) =(1 + z)2dA(z;δ0, zB). (16)
.
B. Data
In this paper, we only use the combined Pantheon sam-
ple [16] to constrain the local cosmic void. This dataset
consists of 1048 SNIa in the redshift range 0 .01< z < 2.3.
In Fig. 2, we show the distribution of these 1048 SNIa in
the galactic coordinate system ( l, b). To probe the asym-
metry in the local cosmic inhomogeneity, we divide the
full dataset into several subsets, as listed in Tab. I. Obvi-
ously, each SNIa subset can only give the local informa-
tion of the universe which can be characterized by a cor-
responding LTB metric. That is to say, the whole profile4
of the local comic void should be reconstructed with the
full SNIa dataset and described by several correspond-
ing LTB metrics. In other words, our model obtains a
probe of anisotropy as illustrated in Fig. 1. There, each
LTB metric being spherically symmetric, the anisotropy
of our model does not proceed from individual segments
but from the assembly of the various solid angle segments.
The model for each segment of the final assembly is in-
deed spherically symmetric. Such segment’s model is ob-
tained by considering the data from that specific solid
angle to virtually be duplicated in all directions into a
spherically symmetric virtual data coverage. It then can
be represented by an LTB metric. We virtually proceed
by restricting the obtained LTB metric within its source
data solid angle. The set of such solid-angle-restricted
LTB metric is then able to capture anisotropy in the
composite total model, despite originating from spheri-
cally symmetric models.

Since SNIa are supposed to be standard candles, we ex-
clude the effects of variations of MBin each SNIa sub-
set on the asymmetry in the local cosmic inhomogeneity.
Therefore, for every division case, we use the full dataset
to constrain the only nuisance parameter MB.
III. RESULTS
The luminosity distance dL(z;δ0, zB) in the ΛLTB
model is numerically given by VoidDistances2020 [30]
which should be fed with parameters corresponding
to the largest scales of the universe. The initializa-
tion of the large scale universe parameters, outside the
void, is done by CLASS [31], even though we don’t
use the CMB data here. For CLASS [31], we need
to provide the ΛCDM model’s six parameters. In
Tab. II, we list such parameters given by Planck 2018 for
TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing [1]. Finally, the likelihoods in
subsection II B are added into MontePython [32] by our
modified monteLLTB [12].
In Tab. III, the constraints on {δ0,s, zC,s, MB}with ev-
ery data subset are summarized. In Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6,
the constraints on {δ0,s, zC,s, MB}with every data subset
for the no cut, horizontal cut, vertical cut and two cuts
cases are also shown respectively. We choose to assume
no anisotropy for MBand treat it as a nuisance parame-
ter. Because we need a standard probe, we used the full
data set to constrain it. This is vindicated as the results
shown in Tab. III turn out to be self-consistent. Although
we suppose δ0,sof every LTB metric is only constrained
with the corresponding data subset and there is no corre-
lation between δ0,s, for any division case, there is an ob-5

vious correlation between δ0,sin Figs. 4, 5 and 6. That
correlation results from our assumption that SNIa are
standard candles so all δ0,sdirectly correlates with MB
and thus indirectly correlates with the other δ0,s. For ev-
ery division case, the correlation between δ0,sjust leads
to a similar error on δ0,s0.08∼0.10 but imposes no ef-
fect on the mean value of δ0,s. Generally speaking, for all
division cases, the constraints on δ0,sare consistent with
the FLRW metric at 95% confidence level (CL): on the
one hand, the constraints on δ0,sare consistent with 0,
which denotes cosmic homogeneity; on the other hand,
the constraints on δ0,sare consistent with each other,
which indicates cosmic isotropy. However, the constraint
onδ0,PSE=−0.15±0.08 deviates from 0 at almost 2 σ.
This deviation results either from the paucity of data in
the P SEdata subset or the real depth of the local cos-
mic void in this direction. Even though we have given
up the determination of the profile at zC≤z < z Bby
setting rB= 2rC, the constraints on zC,sare still very
weak. Although we found PDF peaks at zC,s= 0 and
1≲zC,s≲2.26, we can’t conclude that the Pantheon
data prefers a non-zero zC,stozC,s= 0.
Finally, we can use the constraints on {δ0,s, zC,s}for
every division case, i.e. their best fit, to probe both of the
local cosmic inhomogeneity and the cosmic anisotropy on
small scales. In Figs. 7, 8 and 9, we reconstruct the profile
of local cosmic void δ(z, t0) in different direction (solid
lines) with the constraints summarized in Tab. III. At z≲
zC,s(dashed lines), the curvature changes by 10%. And
we complete the rest of profile until zB,s(dotted lines) byTABLE III: The constraints on void parameters (see

between zC,scan lead to a large difference between zB,s
when the void is deeper at the center. And a deeper void
(or a smaller δ0,s) usually favours a wider void (or a larger
zB,s). Therefore, even a smaller cosmic inhomogeneity at
the center of a deeper void can lead to a larger cosmic
anisotropy at the boundary of this void.
IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this paper, we try to test both of the local cos-
mic inhomogeneity and anisotropy on small scales at the
same time using the SNIa data of Pantheon. Similarly to
the hemisphere comparison method, however using the
LTB metric instead of the FRLW metric, we first di-6

vide the full dataset into several data subsets and then
use the data subsets to constrain the void parameters
{δ0,s, zC,s}in the corresponding direction. Due to the
paucity of data, we concentrate on the profile of the void
atz < z Cwhere the curvature changes by 10%. De-
spite this maneuver, only δ0,sturns out well constrained,
contrary to zC,s. The constraints on δ0,sfor all division
cases are consistent with the FLRW metric at 95% CL.
The constraints on zC,sfor all division cases are almost
beyond 2 .26 at 95% CL. That is to say, our constraintsare too weak to challenge the cosmic homogeneity and
isotropy. If the local cosmic void does exist, however,
even a smaller cosmic inhomogeneity at the center of a
deeper void can lead to a larger cosmic anisotropy at the
boundary of this void.
Although our results are consistent with the cosmic ho-
mogeneity and isotropy at 95% CL, as the δ0,sare con-
sistent with 0 (denoting cosmic homogeneity) while the
constraints on δ0,sare consistent with each other (indi-
cating cosmic isotropy), there are some deviations from7

from the paucity of data in the subset or real physics in
the corresponding direction. Therefore, more SNIa ob-
servations or other cosmological observations are needed
to alleviate the possible effect of paucity of data in certain
directions.Acknowledgments
