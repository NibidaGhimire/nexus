We consider discrete sine-Gordon equation on branched doma ins. The latter is modeled in terms
ofthemetric graphswith discrete bondshavingtheform ofth ebranched1Dchains. Exactanalytical
solutions of the problem are obtained for special case of the constraints given by in terms of simple
sum rule. Numerical solution is obtained when the constrain t is not fulﬁlled.
I. INTRODUCTION
Sine-Gordon solitons attracted much attention in dif-
ferent contexts, from solid state mechanics to quan-
tum ﬁeld theory and Josepshon junctions (see, Refs.[1]-
[8]). Recently, special attention was given to the study
of sine-Gordon solitons in branched domains and net-
works. Particle and wave dynamics in low-dimensional
branched domains is of importance for many practically
important problems arising in newly emerging technolo-
gies. As many device structures and functional materi-
als have branched structure or networked form, control-
ling of wave propagation in such structures play crucial
role for device optimization and material design. Solv-
ing such a task requires developing realistic and phys-
ically acceptable models of the wave dynamics in such
systems. An eﬀective way for modelling of solitons in
networks can be based on the solution of diﬀerent non-
linear evolution equations (approving soliton solutions)
on metric graphs. Such a task has become subject of
extensive study recently (see, Refs. [6]-[22]). Especial-
ly, this concerns condensed matter systems, where par-
ticle and wave transport in linear(quantum) and nonlin-
ear regimes, where the problem of tunable transport is
of crucial importance. Such tasks appear, e.g., in BEC
dynamics, optical harmonic generation low-dimensional
quantum materials, Josephsonjunctions, etc. Tuning the
wave propagation process in these structures allows opti-
mization of material functional properties and improving
of the device performance. In this paper we consider the
model, which is directly related to the problem soliton
dynamics in Josephson junction networks. Namely, we
consider sine-Gordon equation on discrete branched lat-
tice. Sine-Gordon equation in such lattice can describe
Josephson junction(JJ) network consisting of branched
JJ arrays, where superconducting leads are separated by
point-like insulators or normal metals. Diﬀerent versions
of such branched JJ-arrays have been considered earlier
in the Refs.[23]-[27]. However, these studies did not con-
sider soliton dynamics in such structures and did not use
metric grapgh based approach for sine-Gordon equation.
In such lattice, the phase diﬀerence (on each junction)
between the leads is described in terms of the discrete
sine-Gordon equation. Imposing the boundary condi-tions in the of weight continuity and Kirchhoﬀ rules at
the branching point, we derive constraints ensuring in-
tegrability of the Discrete sine-Gordon equation in met-
ric graph. Such constraint can be written in the form
of simple sum rule in terms of the nonlinearity coef-
ﬁcients. Apart from the branched Josephson junction
arrays, within the Frenkel-Kontorova model [2, 3], dis-
crete sine-Gordon equation on matric graphs can be used
for modeling deformation propagation in branched sol-
id materials. In both cases, the main problem having
practical interest is tunable propagation of sine-Gordon
soliton in a branched structure. Here we show that in
casewhentheproblemisintegrableandsine-Gordonsoli-
tonspassthroughthe graphvertexwithoutreﬂection, i.e.

tion we brieﬂy recall the discrete sine-Gordon equation
on a line. In section III we present formulation of the
task and its solution for star branched graph. Section IV
extends the study for the case of loop graph. Finally, the
section V provides some concluding remarks.
II. DISCRETE SINE-GORDON EQUATION ON
A LINE
The discrete sine-Gordon (DSG) equation follows from

Equation of motion for this Hamiltonian, leads to the

whereaandβare constant coeﬃcients. For the above
discrete sine-Gordon (DSG) equation one can write the
charge in the form [3, 5]2

III. DISCRETE SINE-GORDON EQUATION ON
A STAR GRAPH
Consider the star graph that consists of three semi-
inﬁnite chains connected at the vertex (see Fig. 1).
For the ﬁrst j= 1 bond nis numbered as n∈b1=
{−1,−2,−3...}, where ( j,−1) stands for the point near-
est to the vertex. For the right handed j= 2,3 bonds n
is numbered as n∈bj={0,1,2,...}, where ( j,0) means
the branching point.
The DSG equation is written on the each bond of the
star graph as follows
d2uj,n
dt2−aj(uj,n+1−2uj,n+uj,n−1)+βjsinuj,n= 0.(6)
The charge for Eq. (6) can be written as

Furthermore, we assume that αjandβkfulﬁll the fol-
lowing relations:
β1=β2=β3,√a1=√a2+√a3.(15)
Then the soliton (kink) solution of Eq.(6) can be writ-
ten in terms of solution of Eq.(2) as

(16)
It should be noted that Eq.(15) presents condition
(constraint) for integrability of the problem given by
Eqs.(6), (12) and (13). In other words, the discrete sine-
Gordon equation (6) on metric star graph presented in
Fig.1 is integrable if and only if sum rule in Eq.(15) ful-
ﬁlled. In Fig. 2 sptio-temporal evolution of the sine-
Gordon soliton obtained using the exact solution given
by Eq.(16) is plotted. One can clearly observe from this
plot that transmissionofthe sine-Gordonsolitonthrough
the branching point of the graph is reﬂectionless, i.e., no
backscattering is observed for the case, when the prob-
lem is integrable. This feature canbe conﬁrmedby direct
computing reﬂection coeﬃcient (as the ratio of soliton
energy on bond 1 to the total one).

plotted. As it can be seen from this plot, at the value of
a3= 2.51, which correspondsto fulﬁlling of the sum rule,
Rbecomes zero. For the case, when the problem is not
integrable, i.e.. when the sum rule in Eq.(15) is broken,
the problem need to be solved numerically. The plot of
the solution for the case, when the sum rule is broken is
presented in Fig.4. The plot shows that transmission of
sine-Gordon soliton through the branching point is ac-
companies by reﬂection.
IV. EXTENDING TO THE LOOP GRAPH
The above treatment of the DSG equation on star
graph can be extended to the case of other graph topolo-
gies, e.g., to loop graph presented in Fig. 5. The graph
consists of two semi inﬁnite and two ﬁnite chains con-
nected to each other at two vertices. On each bond of
the loop graph we have the DSG equation given by (6).
The charge and the energy for such structure are given4

tion on the loop graph when the sum rule (25) is fulﬁlled, i.e. ,

Again, as it was done in the case of star branched
graph, by substituting the solution of DSGE on a line
into the vertex quasi-boundary conditions given by Eqs.
(21) and (22), one can obtain the following constraints:
β1=β2=β3=β4,√a1=√a2+√a3, a4=a1.

FIG. 7: Contour plot of the numerical solution of DSG equa-
tion on the loop graph when the sum rule (25) is broken, i.e.,
the parameters are chosen as β1=β2=β3=β4= 1, a1=
1, a2=a3= 0.25, a4= 1.1
Fulﬁlling of this constraint implies that the problem giv-
en by Eqs.(6), (21) and (22) is integrable and its (kink)
soliton solution can be written as

In Fig. 6 the contour plot of the soliton solution for thecase, when the sum rule in Eq. (25) is fulﬁlled is present-
ed. One can observe again absence of the backscattering
in case, when the problem is integrable. Fig. 7 presents
similar plots for non-integravble case, when the solu-
tions are obtained numerically. Appearing of reﬂection
in transmission of soliton through the branching point
can be clearly seen from the plot.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We studied the problem of discrete sine-Gordon equa-
tion on a branched lattice by addressing the problem
of integrability and soliton solutions. It is shown that
the problem approves exact soliton solutions, provided
the nonlinearity coupling constant (penetration depth in
case of Josephson junction) assigned to each bond of the
graph fulﬁll certain sum rule. Such case associated also
with the reﬂectionless transmission of sine-Gordon soli-
tons through the branching point. For the cases, when
the sum rule is not fulﬁlled the problem solved analyt-
ically. It is shown for the latter case that reﬂection of
soliton at the vertex can be observed. Although the
above treatment dealt with the star and loop graphs,
the approach developed here can be directly applied for
arbitrary branching topology. The above results can be
directly applied for modeling of the dynamics of sine-
Gordon solitons in branched arrays of Josephson junc-
tions.
