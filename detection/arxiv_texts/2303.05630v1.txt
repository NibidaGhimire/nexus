ABSTRACT
We report the ﬁrst detection of hot molecular cores in the Sma ll Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf
galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mas s young stellar objects in the SMC with the Ata-
cama Large Millimeter /submillimeter Array, and detected emission lines of CO, HCO+, H13CO+, SiO, H 2CO,
CH 3OH, SO, and SO 2. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO 2, whose spatial extent is about 0 .1 pc, and
the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH 3OH, a classical
hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended ( ∼0.2–0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperat ure
is estimated to be 39+8
−6K for one source. Protostellar outﬂows are also detected fro m both sources as high-
velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundan ces of SO 2in hot cores are comparable among the
SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, su ggesting that the chemical reactions leading
to SO 2formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On th e other hand, CH 3OH shows a large
abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The divers ity in the initial condition of star formation
(e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation ﬁeld strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic
molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previ ous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer /inner
Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a co mmon phenomenon during high-mass star for-
mation across the metallicity range of 0 .2–1Z⊙. High-excitation SO 2lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the
low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC.

1.INTRODUCTION
Hot molecular cores are compact ( /lessorsimilar0.1 pc), dense (/greaterorsimilar106
cm−3), and hot (/greaterorsimilar100 K) protostellar sources, which ap-
pear in the early evolutionary stage of massive star forma-
tion (e.g., Kurtz et al. 2000 ). By the observations of Galac-
tic star-forming regions, a variety of molecular species, i n-
cluding complex organic molecules (COMs), are often de-
tected in hot cores owing to their chemically-rich nature (e .g.,
Herbst & van Dishoeck 2009 ). Obtaining a comprehensive
view of chemical compositions of hot cores at various metal-
licities should help understand the e ﬀect of the metallicity on
the chemical evolution of protostellar sources. Such studi es

ical processes of the interstellar medium (ISM) during star -
/planet-formation in primordial galaxies.
The characteristic chemistry of a hot core is triggered
by radiation from the protostar, which warm up the inner
envelope and sublimate ice mantles formed in the earlier
colder evolutionary stage. Across the ice-sublimation rad ius,
there is a sharp change in molecular abundances between
the inner hot-core region ( /greaterorsimilar100 K) and the outer envelope
(/lessorsimilar100 K) (e.g., Charnley et al. 1992 ;Nomura & Millar 2004 ;
Garrod et al. 2008 ). In lower-metallicity cores, if the grain
size distribution is the same, the relative importance of so lid-
phase chemistry to gas-phase chemistry would be smaller be-
cause of the reduced total grain surface area and higher dust
temperature. Thus, at lower metallicity, we naively expect
that hot core regions (i.e., regions where chemistry is domi -2 T. Shimonishietal .
nated by ice sublimation in the vicinity of protostars) woul d
become less distinguished from outer envelopes. The valid-
ity of such a simpliﬁed picture, however, should be exam-
ined carefully since many physical and chemical factors con -
tribute to the observed features of hot cores.
With the advent of the Atacama Large Millime-
ter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), hot cores are now detected
in low-metallicity environments of the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC,∼1/2-1/3Z⊙) (Shimonishi et al. 2016a ,2020 ;
Sewiło et al. 2018 ,2022a ,b) and the extreme outer Galaxy
(∼1/4Z⊙) (Shimonishi et al. 2021 ). Among LMC hot cores,
the abundance of CH 3OH, one of the simplest COMs and a
classical hot-core tracer, shows a large scatter: it is roug hly
a metallicity-scaled abundance of Galactic counterparts i n
some sources, while it is signiﬁcantly depleted beyond the
level of metallicity di ﬀerence in other sources. In contrast,
sulfur-bearing molecules, SO and SO 2, are commonly de-
tected in LMC hot cores with similar abundances. However,
the number of low-metallicity hot core samples is currently
still limited, and observational e ﬀorts to extend hot core stud-
ies to even lower metallicity environments are highly re-
quired.
The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a nearby star-
forming dwarf galaxy located at the distance of 62.1 ±
1.9 kpc ( Graczyk et al. 2014 ). The SMC harbors the low-
est metallicity environment ( ∼1/4-1/10Z⊙, e.g., Hunter et al.
2005 ;Choudhury et al. 2018 ) among the Local-Group star-
forming galaxies where we can detect and spatially resolve
dense gas tracers. It thus provides a valuable opportunity t o
study chemical processing triggered by star formation in a
metal-poor environment. However, although the detection o f
several large molecules such as CH 3OH and SO 2are reported
for a cold molecular cloud core in the SMC ( Shimonishi et al.
2018 ), a hot core is yet to be detected due to the lack of a sys-
tematic survey.
In this work, we report the ﬁrst detection of hot molecular
cores in the SMC based on observations with ALMA.
2.TARGETS, OBSERV ATIONS, AND DATA
REDUCTION
2.1. Targets
The present targets, S07 and S09 from our our survey cata-
logue (see § 2.2) (also known as 2MASS J00540342-7319384
and 2MASS J00445643-7310109, respectively) are classiﬁed
as high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) based on their in-
frared spectral characteristics ( van Loon et al. 2010 ). Their
bolometric luminosities are estimated to be 2.8 ×104L⊙for
S07 and 6.1×104L⊙for S09, respectively ( Oliveira et al.
2013 ). The absorption bands of silicate dust, H 2O ice, and
CO 2ice are detected in both sources, suggesting that they are
still embedded in a dense core ( Oliveira et al. 2013 ). The lo-cation of the sources within the SMC is shown in Appendix
A.
2.2. Observations
Observations were made with ALMA in 2019 and 2022 as
a Cycle 7 program (2019.1.01770.S, PI: K. Tanaka), which
is a part of the “Magellanic Clouds Outﬂow and Chemistry
Survey (MAGOS)” project, in which we observed 10 sources
in the SMC and 30 sources in the LMC. We also use the
ALMA archival data, 2019.1.00534.S (PI: S. Zahorecz). The
sky frequency of 337.81–338.74, 343.59–344.95, 345.01–
347.82, 350.44–352.10, 356.15–359.80 GHz, are covered by
nine spectral windows in total with a velocity resolution of
0.40–0.43 km s−1. Details of the observation settings are
summarized in Appendix A.
2.3. Data reduction
Raw data is processed with the Common Astronomy
Software Applications (CASA) package (version 5.6.1 and
6.2.1). The original synthesized beam size is 0 .′′37–0.′′43×
0.′′30–0.′′33 with the Briggs weighting and a robustness pa-
rameter of 0.5. For the spectral analysis in this work, all
the images are convolved to have a common circular beam
size of 0.′′43, which corresponds to 0.13 pc at the distance of
the SMC. The CASA task tclean is used for imaging and the
masking is done using the auto-multithresh algorithm. The
synthesized images are corrected for the primary beam pat-
tern using the impbcor task in CASA. The continuum im-
age is constructed by selecting line-free channels. Before
the spectral extraction, the continuum emission is subtrac ted
from the spectral data using the uvcontsub task in CASA.
The spectra and continuum ﬂux are extracted from the
0.′′43 diameter circular region centered at RA =0h54m3.s443
and Dec=-73◦19′38.′′51 (ICRS) for S07 and RA =
0h44m56.s421 and Dec=-73◦10′11.′′20 (ICRS) for S09, re-
spectively. These positions correspond to the continuum an d
molecular line peaks of the sources.
3.RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
3.1. Spectra
We identify spectral lines with the aid of the Cologne
Database for Molecular Spectroscopy1(CDMS, M¨ uller et al.
2001 ,2005 ) and the molecular database of the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory2(JPL, Pickett et al. 1998 ). Extracted spectra are
shown in Appendix B.1. The detection criterion adopted here
is 3σsigniﬁcance level and the velocity coincidence with the
systemic velocities of S07 (163.1 km s−1) and S09 (132.0 km
s−1), which are measured using the SO( NJ=89–78) line. For

weak lines, two or three channels are binned to increase the
sensitivity.
Molecular emission lines of CO, HCO+, H13CO+, SiO,
H2CO, CH 3OH, SO, and SO 2are detected in both S07 and
S09. For SO 2and CH 3OH, multiple high excitation lines
with diﬀerent upper state energies are detected. Line param-
eters are measured by ﬁtting a Gaussian. We estimate the
peak brightness temperature, the FWHM, the LSR velocity,
and the integrated intensity for each line based on the ﬁttin g
as summarized in Appendix B.2.
3.2. Images
Figure 1shows synthesized images of continuum and
molecular emission lines. The images are constructed by
integrating spectral data in the velocity range where the
emission is detected. For SO 2and CH 3OH, several emis-
sion lines with similar upper state energies are stacked to
reduce the noise level. Almost molecular emission have
their intensity peak near the submillimeter continuum cen-
ter, which also corresponds to the infrared peak of the
sources. SiO emission is not shown in the ﬁgure since
the line is weak, but it also shows a compact distribu-
tion at the continuum peak. We estimate the size of emis-
sion regions by ﬁtting a two-dimensional Gaussian (see Ta-
ble1). We also estimated the deconvolved source sizes
as/radicalBig
FWHM maj×FWHM min−Θ2
beam, where FWHM maj/min
is the major/minor FWHM size as estimated from the two-
dimensional Gaussian ﬁt, and Θ2
beamis the geometric mean
of the beam major and minor axes. Note that only upper lim-
its are estimated for the emission whose size is comparable
with or smaller than the beam size. Details of the continuum
and molecular line distributions are discussed in Section 4.1.
3.3. Column densities and gas temperatures
We use the rotation diagram method to estimate col-
umn densities and temperatures of SO 2in both sources and
CH 3OH in S07 (Figure 2), while the number of detected
CH 3OH lines in S09 is not su ﬃcient for this purpose. The
details of the formulae are described in Appendix C.1. For
SO2in S09, a straight-line ﬁt is separated into low- and
high-temperature regimes ( Eu<60 K and Eu>60 K), be-
cause diﬀerent temperature components are clearly seen in
the diagram. The high-temperature components of SO 2with
Trot>100 K are detected in both sources. Derived parame-
ters are summarized in Table 1.
For other molecules, the rotation temperatures are assumed
for the column density estimation. We have applied low
rotation-temperatures from 30 to 60 K, because the analy-
ses for hot cores in the LMC and the outer Galaxy report
Trot∼40–50 K for relatively small molecules with extendedspatial distributions, such as SO and CS ( Shimonishi et al.
2020 ,2021 ). The same temperature range is applied for
CH 3OH in S09, which also shows an extended distribution.
If the rotation temperature of CH 3OH in S09 is assumed to be
the same as that of the high-temperature component of SO 2,
then we obtain a twice higher CH 3OH column density.
3.4. H2column density and abundances
The column density of molecular hydrogen ( NH2) is esti-
mated from the dust continuum data based on the standard
treatment of optically thin emission (see Appendix C.2for
details). The assumption of the dust temperature Tdmay
cause considerable uncertainty in the derivation of NH2. A
detailed analysis of e ﬀective dust temperature in the line of
sight toward an LMC hot core suggests that Tdis somewhat
lower than the temperature of a hot core region traced by SO 2
or CH 3OH due to the temperature gradient in a protostellar
envelope ( Shimonishi et al. 2020 ). In this work, we have ap-
plied Tdfrom 50 to 100 K to estimate the possible range of
theNH2values. The 850µm continuum brightness is mea-
sured to be 1.52 mJy /beam for S07 and 2.62 mJy /beam for
S09 (with a beam size of 0 .′′37×0.′′32), and with the above
assumption, we obtain NH2=(1.5±0.5)×1023cm−2for S07
and (2.5±0.8)×1023cm−2for S09, respectively. Fractional
molecular abundances with respect to H 2are calculated using
those NH2and summarized in Table 1. The gas number den-
sity is estimated to be nH2=6×105cm−3for S07 and 9×105
cm−3for S09, assuming the source diameter of 0.13 pc and
the uniform spherical distribution of gas around a protosta r.
4.DISCUSSION
4.1. Hot molecular cores associated with S07 and S09
S07 and S09 show the following characteristics; (i) the
compact distribution of dense gas tracers ( ∼0.1 pc, Section
3.2), (ii) the high gas temperature ( ≥100 K, Section 3.3),
(iii) the high density ( ∼106cm−3, Section 3.4), (iv) the as-
sociation with a high-mass protostar (3-6 ×104L⊙), and (v)
the association with protostellar outﬂows (see Appendix D).
These natures suggest that the sources are still in the early
evolutionary stage of high-mass star formation, harboring a
hot molecular core in the vicinity of the central protostar.
4.2. SO2as a tracer of low-metallicity hot cores
In both sources, a compact high-temperature region around
the protostar is traced by SO 2gas. The deconvolved source
size of SO 2is/lessorsimilar0.05 pc for S07 and 0.09 pc for S09 (Ta-
ble. 1), which are comparable with or smaller than those of
known LMC hot cores ( Shimonishi et al. 2016b ;Sewiło et al.
2018 ;Shimonishi et al. 2020 ;Sewiło et al. 2022b ). With the
LTE assumption, the compact high-temperature regions in
S07 and S09 are hot enough to sublimate the ice mantle, and
the SO 2gas likely arises mainly from the hot cores.4 T. Shimonishietal .

In contrast, the CH 3OH emission show larger deconvolved
source sizes (0.21 pc for S07 and 0.25 pc for S09) compared
to that of SO 2, and associated with extended emission com-
ponents. Although several high- Eulines ( Eu>60 K) in S07
are detected, the rotation temperature is much lower than th at
of SO 2. Low-excitation CH 3OH lines ( Eu=17–36 K) are
even extended, and the emission peak does not correspond to
the hot core position.
The clearly diﬀerent spatial distributions and rotation tem-
peratures between SO 2and CH 3OH are in stark contrast to
the characteristics of known LMC hot cores, as their high-
excitation SO 2and CH 3OH lines are both compact ( ∼0.1
pc) and hot ( Trot>100 K) (e.g., Shimonishi et al. 2020 ;
Sewiło et al. 2022b ). In the present SMC hot cores, SO 2and
CH 3OH may have diﬀerent physical origins.
Both SO 2and CH 3OH are believed to be tracer molecules
of hot cores in the Galactic and LMC star-forming regions.
In hot cores, SO 2could be formed by high-temperature gas-
phase reactions of H 2S, HS, and OCS, which are sublimated
from sulfur-bearing ices (e.g., Vidal & Wakelam 2018 ). If
solid H 2S is a dominant sulfur reservoir in a prestellar stage,
the expected major pathway to form SO 2in a hot core is H 2S
H− →SHH− →SOH/O2−−−−−→ SOOH−−→SO2, and the co-evolution of SO
and SO 2abundances is predicted by astrochemical simula-
tions (e.g., Charnley 1997 ;Nomura & Millar 2004 ). Alterna-
tively, SO 2can be produced at a prestellar stage by cosmic-
ray-induced radiation chemistry and bulk reactions of reac -
tive species in ice mantles ( Shingledecker et al. 2020 ), and
subsequently released into gas-phase by sublimation in a ho t
core.
Figure 3compares the SO 2column densities with those
of SO and SiO for SMC, LMC, and Galactic hot cores (see
Section 4.3for the references of the plotted data). The SO 2column densities show a tight correlation with SO (correla-
tion coeﬃcient: 0.98), while they do not correlate with the
strong-shock tracer SiO (correlation coe ﬃcient: 0.32). This
would suggest that the formation of SO 2in the current sam-
ple is mainly induced by the sublimation of sulfur-bearing
ices, rather than sputtering by strong shocks.
CH 3OH is reported to be e ﬃciently formed by the
successive hydrogenation of CO on grain surfaces (e.g.,
Watanabe & Kouchi 2002 ). The reaction typically proceeds
at low temperatures ( /lessorsimilar20 K), and thus abundant solid
CH 3OH can be formed in cold prestellar /protostellar stages
(e.g., Boogert et al. 2011 ;Whittet et al. 2011 ). At the hot-
core stage, the radiation from the protostar can trigger the
thermal desorption of ice mantles, and if the abundant reser -
voir of solid CH 3OH is present, the abundance of gaseous
CH 3OH will be signiﬁcantly enhanced.
In the case of S07 and S09, such a high-temperature re-
gion is traced by hot SO 2gas with a compact distribution
centered at the continuum peak. A relatively low tempera-
ture and extended spatial distribution of CH 3OH suggest that
the contribution from a non-thermal desorption is not neg-
ligible for its production in both sources. Considering the
presence of protostellar outﬂows (Appendix D), sputtering of
ice mantles by shock (e.g., Aota et al. 2015 ) or photodesorp-
tion by UV photons in an outﬂow cavity wall of the central
protostar may be responsible for the desorption mechanism.
Note that the latter mechanism is still under debate, since l ab-
oratory experiments have reported that solid CH 3OH read-
ily dissociates upon photodesorption by the UV irradiation
(Bertin et al. 2016 ;Cruz-Diaz et al. 2016 ).

LMC/SMC hot cores. Figure 4shows a comparison of
metallicity-scaled molecular abundances for SMC, LMC,
and Galactic hot cores. The data of LMC hot cores are
adopted from Shimonishi et al. (2016a ,2020 );Sewiło et al.
(2022b ), where the NH2of ST11, N105 2B/2A, and N113 A1
are re-estimated using the same dust opacity data as in this
work and dust temperature of Td=60 K. Abundances for
Galactic sources are collected from the literatures for a sa m-
ple of 11–17 hot cores ( Sutton et al. 1995 ;MacDonald et al.
1996 ;Helmich & van Dishoeck 1997 ;Hatchell et al. 1998 ;
van der Tak et al. 2000 ;Qin et al. 2010 ;Zernickel et al.
2012 ;Xu & Wang 2013 ;Gerner et al. 2014 ). In the ﬁgure,
the lower and upper quartiles of the abundance distribution s
are plotted with the median value. HCO+abundances are
calculated from H13CO+assuming12C/13C=49, 50, and 77for SMC, LMC, and Galactic sources ( Heikkil¨ a et al. 1999 ;
Wang et al. 2009 ;Wilson & Rood 1994 ).
In Figure 4, to correct for the metallicity di ﬀerence, the
molecular abundances of SMC and LMC hot cores are scaled
in accordance with their metallicities. We have estimated
the local metallicities of the individual hot cores based on
the metallicity maps of the SMC and LMC reported in
Choudhury et al. (2016 ,2018 ). The metallicity for the two
SMC hot cores is measured to be [Fe /H]=−0.8 dex (0.2 Z⊙),
while that for the LMC hot cores is typically [Fe /H]=−0.4
dex (0.4 Z⊙). We assume a solar metallicity for Galactic hot
cores.
As seen in the ﬁgure, the CH 3OH abundance shows large
source-to-source variation even after corrected for the me tal-
licity. In contrast, the metallicity-scaled abundance of S O2is
relatively constant among SMC, LMC, and Galactic sources.
The reason for the large abundance diversity of CH 3OH gas
in LMC/SMC hot cores is still under debate. Astrochemi-
cal simulations for the chemical evolution of LMC /SMC hot
cores suggest that dust temperature at the initial ice-form ing
stage has a signiﬁcant e ﬀect on the CH 3OH gas abundance
in the subsequent hot core stage, because the formation of
solid CH 3OH is sensitive to dust temperature and it is in-
hibited on warmer grain surfaces ( Acharyya & Herbst 2018 ;
Shimonishi et al. 2020 ). Therefore, the diversity in the ini-
tial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding ,
local radiation ﬁeld strength) may lead to the large abun-
dance variation of CH 3OH. Infrared ice observations argue
that the inhibition of solid CH 3OH in the ice-forming stage is
more likely to occur in the LMC condition due to the lower
dust abundance and the stronger interstellar radiation ﬁel d
(Shimonishi et al. 2016a ).
On the other hand, SO 2would not be inherited from the
prestellar stage to the hot core stage, because it is mainly
synthesized by high-temperature gas-phase chemistry. Thu s,
except for the elemental abundance e ﬀect, the local interstel-
lar condition would not largely a ﬀect the SO 2abundance in
hot cores, which may result in a constant metallicity-scale d
abundance of SO 2across SMC, LMC, and Galactic sources.
Such behavior of SO 2is predicted by the astrochemical simu-
lations dedicated to LMC hot cores ( Shimonishi et al. 2020 ),
but now the present study suggests that it is also applicable
to the SMC hot cores.
5.SUMMARY
We report the detection of two hot molecular cores in the
SMC based on 0.1 pc-scale submillimeter observations to-
ward high-mass YSOs with ALMA. Emission lines of CO,
HCO+, H13CO+, SiO, H 2CO, CH 3OH, SO, and SO 2are de-
tected from the sources. The associated protostellar out-
ﬂows are also observed. The compact hot-core regions are
traced by SO 2gas, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and8 T. Shimonishietal .
Figure 4. Comparison of metallicity-scaled molecular abundances of hot cores between SMC (red, this work), LMC (yellow), and Gal actic
sources (cyan). Abundances of SMC and LMC hot cores are multi plied by the corresponding metallicity factors (see Sectio n4.3). The area
with thin vertical lines indicate the error bar for SMC /LMC sources, while those of Galactic sources indicate the lo wer and upper quartiles of
the abundance distribution. The bar with a color gradient in dicate an upper limit. See Section 4.3for details.
the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the ex-
citation analysis. In contrast, CH 3OH, a classical hot-core
tracer, is dominated by extended ( ∼0.2–0.3 pc) components,
and low gas temperature ( <40 K) is inferred for one source.
The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO 2in hot cores are
comparable between SMC, LMC, and Galactic sources, sug-
gesting that the chemical reactions leading to the formatio n
of SO 2would be regulated by the sulfur abundances. On
the other hand, CH 3OH shows a large abundance variation
within SMC and LMC hot cores. This di ﬀerence would be
due to their diﬀerent chemical origin. High-excitation SO 2
lines will be a useful tracer of hot cores in the low-metallic ity
environments of the SMC and LMC. In conjunction with pre-
vious hot core studies in the LMC and outer /inner Galaxy,
the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenonduring star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2–1
Z⊙.

the spectra are sorted in ascending order of the upper state e nergy (the emission line with the lowest upper state energy i s shown in the upper
left panel and that with the highest energy is in the lower rig ht panel). The adjacent stronger line seen in SO 2(16 4,12–16 3,13) was subtracted

B.2. Measured line parameters
Tables B2–B3summarize line parameters measured by
spectral ﬁtting (see Section 3.1for details). Tbr,∆V,/integraltext
TbrdV, and VLS Rindicate the peak brightness temperature,
the FWHM, the integrated intensity, and the systemic veloc-
ity. For CO(3–2), since it shows a clear non-Gaussian com-
ponent, the integrated intensity is calculated by directly inte-grating the spectrum over the frequency region of emission.
The tables also contain the upper limits on important non-
detection lines. The tabulated uncertainties and upper lim its
are of 2σlevel and do not include systematic errors due to
continuum subtraction. Upper limits on integrated intensi -
ties are estimated assuming ∆V=4 km s−1. Note that the
systemic velocities of S07 and S09 mentioned in the text is
based on the SO( NJ=89–78) line.

C.DERIV ATION OF COLUMN DENSITIES AND TEMPERATURES
C.1. Rotation diagram analysis
We use the following formulae based on the standard treatmen t of the rotation diagram method (e.g., Sutton et al. 1995 ):

TbdVis the integrated intensity estimated from the observation s,νis the transition frequency, Sis the line strength,
µis the dipole moment, Trotis the rotational temperature, Euis the upper state energy, Nis the total column density, and Q(Trot)
is the partition function at Trot. We assume an optically thin condition and the local thermod ynamic equilibrium (LTE). All the
spectroscopic parameters required in the analysis are extr acted from the CDMS database.
C.2. Derivation of the H 2column density from the dust continuum
We use the following equation to calculate NH2based on the standard treatment of optically thin dust emiss ion:
NH2=Fν/Ω
2κνBν(Td)ZµmH, (C3)
where Fν/Ωis the continuum ﬂux density per beam solid angle as estimate d from the observations, κνis the mass absorption
coeﬃcient of dust grains coated by thin ice mantles taken from Ossenkopf & Henning (1994 ) and we use 1.94 cm2g−1at 850
µm,Tdis the dust temperature and Bν(Td) is the Planck function, Zis the dust-to-gas mass ratio, µis the mean atomic mass per
hydrogen (1.41, according to Cox 2000 ), and mHis the hydrogen mass. We use the dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.0 016, which is
obtained by scaling the Galactic value of 0.008 by the metall icity of the SMC. The assumed dust temperature is described i n the
main text.
D.MOLECULAR OUTFLOWS TRACED BY CO
Protostellar molecular outﬂows are detected in S07 and S09 a s high-velocity CO(3-2) components (Fig. D4). The presence of
shocked H 2gas associated with the protostar is reported in Ward et al. (2017 ) for both sources based on high-spatial resolution
near-infrared integral ﬁeld spectroscopy. The molecular c omponent of outﬂows in S07 is recently reported by Tokuda et al. (2022 )
with ALMA observations of the CO(3-2) line. The outﬂows dete cted in S09 is the second example of CO-traced protostellar
outﬂows found in the SMC. A detailed analysis of protostella r outﬂows for a sample of LMC /SMC YSOs will be reported in a
future paper based on the MAGOS data (Tanaka et al. in prep.).Hotcoresinthe SMC 17

Figure D4. CO(3-2) outﬂows detected in S07 (a) and S09 (b). The upper pan els show the spatial distribution of high-velocity CO gas. B lue
contours represent the blue-shifted component (integrate d over 146–158 km s−1for S07 and 108–121 km s−1for S09), while red contours
represent the red-shifted component (integrated over 168– 180 km s−1for S07 and 138–150 km s−1for S09). Background is the 850 µm
continuum ﬂux. The green stars represent the position of the protostar inferred from the continuum peak position. The sy nthesized beam size is
shown by the gray ﬁlled circle in each panel. The lower panels show the CO(3-2) spectra extracted at the hot core position a s in Figures B2–B3.
The velocity ranges of the blue- and red-shifted high-veloc ity components are indicated by blue and red, respectively. The dotted lines indicate
a systemic velocity of the source estimated from the SO( NJ=88–77) line.
