We study the characteristics of Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in simple mixed-wet porous micromodels nu-
merically using a dynamic pore network model. The porous micromodel consists of distinct water-wet and
oil-wet regions, whose fractions are systematically varied to yield a variety of displacement patterns over
a wide range of capillary numbers. We Ô¨Ånd that the impact of mixed-wettability is most prominent at low
capillary number, and it depends on the complex interplay between wettability fraction and the intrinsic
contact angle of the water-wet regions. For example, the fractal dimension of the displacement pattern is a
monotonically increasing function of wettability fraction in Ô¨Çow cells with strongly water-wet clusters, but
it becomes non-monotonic with respect to wettability fraction in Ô¨Çow cells with weakly water-wet clusters.
Additionally, mixed-wettability also manifests itself in the injection-pressure signature, which exhibits Ô¨Çuc-
tuations especially at low wettability fraction. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, preferential Ô¨Ålling of water-wet regions leads to
reduced effective permeability and higher injection pressure, even at vanishingly small capillary numbers.
Finally, we demonstrate that scaling analyses based on a weighted average description of the overall wet-
ting state of the mixed-wet system can effectively capture the variations in observed displacement pattern
morphology.
INTRODUCTION
Fluid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in porous media is a complex phenomenon with signiÔ¨Åcant practical
importance. The behavior of Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in porous media impacts various natural and
industrial processes such as geological carbon sequestration [1, 2], water inÔ¨Åltration into soil [3, 4],
enhanced oil recovery (EOR) [5, 6], and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers [7, 8].
Decades of research have illustrated that the displacement process is governed by the competition
between capillary and viscous forces as characterized by the capillary number Ca, and the viscosity
contrast between the invading and defending Ô¨Çuid as characterized by the viscosity ratio M[9]. In
addition, the invading Ô¨Çuid‚Äôs relative afÔ¨Ånity to the solid surface in the presence of the defending
Ô¨Çuid (i.e. wettability) as characterized by the contact angle also exerts fundamental control
over the Ô¨Çow behavior [10‚Äì12]. For instance, when the displacing Ô¨Çuid is more wetting to the
porous media than the displaced Ô¨Çuid (i.e., imbibition), the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement pattern is
generally more compact than the opposite case (i.e., drainage) [12‚Äì16]. Today, we have a fairly
good understanding of how the interplay between Ca, M, andimpact Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement
2in porous media with spatially uniform wettability [17].
In contrast, our knowledge of Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in porous media with spatially-heterogeneous
wettability (i.e., mixed-wet) is much less complete, despite its common occurrence in natural sys-
tems. Mixed-wettability in natural porous systems could originate from the spatial variation in
mineral composition and surface roughness. Although reservoirs and aquifers consist primarily
of water-wet minerals such as quartz and calcite, they also include other constituent minerals
with different wettability states [18, 19]. Moreover, water-wet minerals are known to become
oil-wet after exposure to polar hydrocarbon components (e.g., asphaltenes) and some micro-
organisms [20‚Äì22]. Indeed, high-resolution in-situ contact angle measurements of oil-bearing
reservoir rocks have shown mixed-wettability with a wide range of contact angles [23‚Äì25]. In
the context of geological carbon sequestration, recent experiments have demonstrated that cyclic
injection of supercritical CO 2and brine altered the wettability of a Bentheimer sandstone core,
making it less water-wet [26].
The behavior of Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in mixed-wet porous media is markedly different from
uniform-wet porous media. The signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence of mixed-wettability on multiphase Ô¨Çow in
porous media Ô¨Årst emerged in the oil industry, where mixed-wet cores often displayed higher oil
displacement efÔ¨Åciency than water-wet cores after waterÔ¨Çooding experiment [27, 28]. This behav-
ior is attributed to the existence of interfaces with very low mean curvature and negative Gaussian
curvature (i.e., coexisting curvatures with opposite signs in orthogonal directions) [29]. Low mean
curvature leads to low capillary pressures, while negative Gaussian curvature leads to good connec-
tivity within Ô¨Çuids of the same phase, such that water and oil can Ô¨Çow simultaneously [24, 29, 30].
In the context of CO 2storage, it has been observed that CO 2-brine displacement in mixed-wet
rocks results in less CO 2trapping compared to the same process in water-wet rocks [31‚Äì33].
Characterizing the wetting state of porous media with heterogeneous wettability is the Ô¨Årst step
to understanding Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in mixed-wet porous media [34]. While the wettability
of uniform-wet porous media can be described by its contact angle , describing the wettability of
even the simplest mixed-wet porous media consisting of solids exhibiting just two contact angles
requires knowledge of (i) the value of each contact angle, ii) fraction of the porous media covered
by solids of each contact angle (i.e., wettability fraction), iii) spatial distribution of the wettability
heterogeneity as characterized by the correlation length of clusters with different contact angles as
well as their sizes [35].
Due to the various complexities involved in fully characterizing the wetting state of natu-
3ral mixed-wet porous media, systematic and mechanistic investigation of the impact of mixed-
wettability on Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in porous media can be greatly aided by the use of simple
analog systems with well-controlled geometry and wettability states [36‚Äì39]. Geistlinger et al.
[38] performed waterÔ¨Çooding experiments in an air-Ô¨Ålled mixed-wet micromodel, which was fab-
ricated by mixing water-wet ( = 0) and oil-wet ( = 100) glass beads in a cylindrical con-
tainer. They observed a decrease in residual trapping as the fraction of water-wet beads increased
from 30% to 70%. Murison et al. [36] conducted waterÔ¨Çooding experiments in oil-Ô¨Ålled bead
columns where half of the beads‚Äô area was water-wet ( = 20) while the other half was oil-wet
(= 130). They observed smoothing of the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement front as the correlation
length of different wettability clusters decreased. More recently, Irannezhad et al. [39] studied the
radial displacement of oil by water in mixed-wet microÔ¨Çuidic Ô¨Çow cells patterned with cylindrical
posts. The bulk of the Ô¨Çow cell was oil-wet ( = 120), and mixed-wettability was introduced
by placing discrete water-wet clusters that were either weakly water-wet ( = 60) or strongly
water-wet (= 30). The experiments revealed surprising displacement patterns that arise as a
result of mixed-wettability ‚Äî the invading water preferentially Ô¨Ålls strongly water-wet clusters
but encircles weakly water-wet clusters instead. This counter-intuitive Ô¨Ånding was attributed to
the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface conÔ¨Åguration at mixed-wet pores, which resemble S-shaped saddles with
mean curvatures close to zero.
While well-designed analog experiments have contributed to our mechanistic understanding of
Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in mixed-wet porous media, they remain prohibitively expensive to sweep
a wide range of the relevant parameter spaces. Pore-scale modelling is a useful alternative in this
endeavor, since it has become increasingly more predictive in recent years [12]. Bakhshian and
Hosseini [40] investigated the effect of wettability heterogeneity on the Ô¨Çow of supercritical CO 2
and brine in a 1:2mm3digital rock sample using lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,
they increased the fraction of CO 2-wet portions of the simulation domain from 10% to 50% and
observed more residual trapping of CO 2. However, LB simulations remain computationally chal-
lenging and expensive [41]. In contrast, pore-network models are attractive due to their intuitive
nature and relatively low computational cost [42], and they have been applied in a recent study to
extend the classic Lenormand‚Äôs diagram to include the impact of wettability [17].
Here, we employ a dynamic pore network model to investigate the impact of mixed-wettability
on Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in simple model porous media consisting of water-wet and oil-wet
regions with distinct contact angles. For each contact-angle pair, we systematically vary the wet-
4tability fraction and study the displacement pattern over a wide range of Ca. We Ô¨Ånd that the dis-
placement pattern is controlled by the interplay between Ca, wettability fraction, and intrinsic wet-
tability of the water-wet regions, leading to complex behaviors. Furthermore, mixed-wettability
induces Ô¨Çuctuations in the injection pressure, whose magnitude has a large viscous component,
even at vanishingly small Ca. Finally, we demonstrate that scaling analyses based on a simple,
weighted average description of the overall wettability of the model mixed-wet porous media can
effectively predict the Ô¨Ånger width of the displacement pattern.
METHOD
We design a microÔ¨Çuidic porous media by placing 16;000cylindrical posts on an irregular
triangular lattice. The lattice is generated inside a 5-inch diameter circle using the pdemesh tool
in MATLAB. We assign the radius of each post to be 47% of the distance between its center and
the nearest neighboring post‚Äôs center. In our system, the radius of the posts follow a Gaussian-like
distribution that ranges from 110m to 850m with a median value of 340m. The pore throat
sizes follow a lognormal-like distribution that ranges from 50m to 700m with a median value
of200m. We make the posts‚Äô height h= 200m to match the median pore throat size.
We implement mixed-wettability by placing water-wet clusters in a simulation domain that
is otherwise oil-wet. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we randomly assign Nposts as the seeds for generating the
water-wet clusters. At each seed post, we draw a circle with a radius of 5 median posts and make
all posts and surfaces within the circle water-wet. Overlapping circles merge and form a single
cluster (Fig. 1a). Increasing Nincreases the wettability fraction fw, which is deÔ¨Åned as the number
of water-wet posts to the total number of posts. In this model, oil-wet and water-wet regions are
separated by sharp boundaries connecting the adjacent pores centers (Fig. 1a top inset). The top
and bottom surfaces of the mixed-wet pores also have spatially heterogeneous wettability (Fig. 1a
bottom inset).
We apply a dynamic pore-network model to simulate Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in mixed-wet
microÔ¨Çuidic cells. The model was Ô¨Årst introduced in Irannezhad et al. [39], but we describe its
details for the Ô¨Årst time here. Our mixed-wet model is based on the model of Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displace-
ment in uniform-wet porous media developed by Primkulov et al. [43]. The model establishes
an analogy between multiphase Ô¨Çow in porous media and electrical current in a circuit with Ô¨Åxed
resistors and moving capacitors. This analogy enables the model to capture the effects of capillary
5FIG. 1. (a) We develop a dynamic pore network model to simulate Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement through ana-
log porous media with spatially heterogeneous wettability (i.e., mixed-wet). The Ô¨Çow geometry is radial
and quasi-two-dimensional, consisting of 16;000cylindrical posts. We achieve mixed-wettability by
placing base water-wet clusters (blue regions) that span 5 posts in a domain that is otherwise oil-wet (gray
regions). The base water-wet clusters merge and form larger clusters (top inset). The water-wet and oil-
wet regions are separated by sharp boundaries (bottom inset). (b) Fluid-Ô¨Çuid interface at a mixed-wet pore
throat resembles an S-shaped saddle in three dimensions [39]. Our model explicitly calculates the criti-
cal pressures of pore-scale instabilities and advances the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface when either a burst, touch, or
overlap event occurs. (c) Our pore network model captures the nuanced and complex behavior of multi-
phase Ô¨Çow in mixed-wet porous media [39]. The invading water (yellow) preferentially Ô¨Ålls the water-wet
clusters with contact angle = 30(left panel), but encircles the water-wet clusters with = 60(right
panel). The oil-wet clusters have = 120in both cases. Experiments and simulations are conducted at
Ca= 110 4[39].
6pressure (at pore throats where Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interfaces exist) and viscous pressure drop (at all pore
throats) simultaneously throughout the network. Adding wettability effects to the model requires
an understanding of invasion mechanisms at the pore-scale, where Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interfaces advance
as invading Ô¨Çuid pressure increases. This advancement eventually leads to the invasion of the
adjacent pore through one of the three possible types of invasion events [11, 44]: i) Burst , equiv-
alent to Haines jump [45], occurs when there is no stable conÔ¨Åguration for a Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface
connecting two posts. Thus, the interface suddenly invades the adjacent pore and splits into two
interfaces; ii) Touch occurs when the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface connecting two posts touches a third
post‚Äôs body. Similar to the burst event, the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface splits into two interfaces; and iii)
Overlap occurs when two neighboring Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interfaces meet on a common post. In this case,
the two interfaces merge and form a single, wider interface spanning the neighboring posts. The
conÔ¨Åguration of any given Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface can be described by its in-plane and out-of-plane
curvatures.
In a quasi-2D, uniform-wet microÔ¨Çuidic cell, the interface‚Äôs out-of-plane radius of curvature
routis constant and equal to h=(2cos), while its in-plane radius of curvature rindecreases as the
interface advances through the pore throat. Therefore, capillary pressure at the interface gradually
increases as the interface advances, until the interface undergoes an invasion event (i.e., burst,
touch, or overlap). The capillary pressure associated with pore invasion is termed the critical
capillary pressure, and it is given by pcrit

curvatures corresponding to burst, touch and overlap events, respectively. These in-plane radii
of curvatures for pore invasion mechanisms in a uniform-wet microÔ¨Çuidic cell have been derived
in Primkulov et al. [14].
The Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface conÔ¨Åguration at a mixed-wet pore throat is more complex. In particu-
lar, the interface has been observed to be saddle-shaped [29]. Additionally, in-situ measurements
of Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interfaces in carbonate rocks have revealed that their mean curvatures are notice-
ably lower in mixed-wet rocks compared to similar water-wet rocks [29, 46]. Recent experiments
in mixed-wet microÔ¨Çuidics provided high-resolution visualization of the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface be-
tween two posts of contrasting wettabilities, which resembles an S-shaped saddle in 3D with mean
curvatures close to zero [39].
The in-plane view of a typical S-shaped Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface at a mixed-wet pore throat is shown
in Fig. 1b. Post 1 is an oil-wet post with contact angle o, radiusR1, and center coordinate A (0;0),
7while post 2 is a water-wet post with contact angle w, radiusR2, and center coordinate B (X2;0).
We approximate the S-shaped interface as two circular arcs (_
CEand_
EH) that smoothly connect
at the wettability boundary. The centers of_
CEand_
EH are located at I ( Xp1,Yp1) and G (Xp2,
Yp2), while their radii are given by rp1andrp2, respectively. We denote the distance between points
A and I asd1, which is given by the law of cosines at the triangle 4AIC as

Finally, we note that the mean curvature of the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface in the oil-wet region must

The shape of the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface at the mixed-wet pore throat is fully described by Xp1,Yp1,
Xp2,Yp2,rp1, andrp2. For a given rp1, we Ô¨Årst solve for rp2(Eq. (6)). We then solve for d1andd2
(Eqs. (1)-(2)), followed by solving for Xp1,Yp1,Xp2, andYp2(Eqs. (3)-(5)).
8We follow the algorithm below to Ô¨Ånd the critical capillary pressures associated with burst,
touch, and overlap invasion events. Starting with a large rp1, we solve Eqs. (1)-(6). If no valid
solution is found, we decrease rp1and repeat the process until a valid Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface is found.
We then depict the interface and check if touch or overlap will occur. Touch occurs when the de-
picted interface intersects a neighboring third post, while overlap occurs when the depicted inter-
face intersects an adjacent interface [11, 44]. We successively decrease rp1until no valid solution
can be found, which corresponds to the point when burst occurs. Similar to the homogeneous-wet

Our model captures the effects of viscous pressure drop across the system by solving the equations
of Poiseuille‚Äôs law and mass conservation for the network of pore throats. We impose constant
Ô¨Çow boundary condition at the inlet pore throats and constant pressure boundary condition at
the outlet pores along the perimeter. We assign the viscosities of the defending Ô¨Çuid and the
invading Ô¨Çuid to be def= 50 mPas andinv= 0:99mPas, respectively, and the interfacial
tension between the Ô¨Çuids to be = 13 mN/m. These Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid properties correspond to the
microÔ¨Çuidic experiments of Irannezhad et al. [39], which enables direct comparison between the
model predictions and the experiments. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the model captures the salient behaviors
of the mixed-wet microÔ¨Çuidic experiment ‚Äì the invading Ô¨Çuid preferentially Ô¨Ålls the water-wet
clusters with contact angle = 30, but encircles the weakly water-wet clusters with contact angle
= 60instead (Fig. 1c). The oil-wet regions of the Ô¨Çow cell have a contact angle of = 120in
both cases.

in simple mixed-wet microÔ¨Çuidics. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, each simulation domain consists of water-wet
regions with contact angle wand oil-wet regions with contact angle o. We consider three different
contact angle pairs ‚Äî w-o= 30-120,60-120,60-150. Our systematic investigation includes

different base water-wet cluster placements to verify the reproducibility of the results. Fig. 2 shows
the phase diagrams of the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement patterns in mixed-wet domains consisting of
the three contact angle pairs, and at different Ca and fw. Qualitatively, the displacements display
the canonical viscous Ô¨Ångering pattern at high Ca for all mixed-wettability conditions. As Ca
decreases, the displacement patterns become more compact with increasing fw, though this effect
is much more noticeable in mixed-wet domains with contact angle pair of 30-120compared to
domains with contact angle pairs of 60-120and60-150.

via the box-counting method [47, 48], while wfis deÔ¨Åned as the average Ô¨Ånger width normalized
by the average pore size [11, 44, 49, 50].
Increasing Ca leads to smaller wfin all mixed-wet domains due to viscous effects. Increasing
fwonly yields moderately higher wfin mixed-wet domains with contact angle pairs of 60-120
and60-150, though the positive correlation between wfandfwis signiÔ¨Åcantly more prominent
in mixed-wet domains with a contact angle pair of 30-120(Fig. 3a). Variations in wfcan be ex-
plained by the pore-scale invasion mechanism. The dominant pore invasion mechanism in oil-wet
porous media is burst, while pores in water-wet porous media experience more overlap [14, 49].
During overlap events, the invasion of one pore destabilizes the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface at the neigh-
boring pore, creating a smoother displacement front [11, 13, 44]. Therefore, wfincreases with
increasingfw. Furthermore, the probability of overlap events occurring increases as the invad-
ing Ô¨Çuid becomes more wetting to the porous media [13, 14, 49]. Indeed, tracking the invasion
12event type reveals that increase in overlap events with increasing fwis much more signiÔ¨Åcant in
mixed-wet domains with a contact angle pair of 30-120, compared to the mixed-wet domains
with contact angle pairs of 60-120and60-150(Fig. 3c-e).
We measure the fractal dimension of the displacement patterns at the lowest capillary number
(Ca= 510 6), which characterizes the extent to which the displacement patterns Ô¨Åll space in 2
dimensions (Fig. 3b). As expected, Dfincreases with increasing fwin mixed-wet domains with
a contact angle pair of 30-120due to the rise in overlap-driven smoothing of the displacement
front. However, this is not the case in mixed-wet domains with contact angle pairs of 60-120
and60-150, whereDfis a non-monotonic function of fw, andDfreaches a maximum at fw=
50%. This surprising behavior can be rationalized by the following arguments: at low fw, the
broadening of the displacement pattern is controlled by the size and distribution of the water-wet
clusters ‚Äî increasing the size and number of water-wet clusters increases Df; at highfw, however,
the broadening of the displacement pattern is controlled by the intrinsic wettability of the water-
wet clusters ‚Äî more strongly water-wet clusters will yield higher Dfdue to a higher probability
of overlap events. We note that such contrasting behaviors have been observed in waterÔ¨Çooding
experiments in mixed-wet oil-bearing porous media. For instance, Singhal et al. [51] found that
oil recovery efÔ¨Åciency increases monotonically as the fraction of the water-wet surface area of the
porous medium increases. In contrast, Skauge [52, 53] found that oil recovery efÔ¨Åciency shows
a non-monotonic trend according to wettability, with highly mixed-wet cores showing higher oil
recovery efÔ¨Åciency than mostly water-wet and oil-wet cores.
Pressure signatures. We track the injection pressure evolution to gain further insight into the
macroscopic impact of mixed-wettability on Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in porous media. Injection
pressure is a valuable piece of information in various subsurface applications including geological
carbon sequestration [54] and hydraulic fracturing [55], and it can help inform the wettability state
of the porous medium [56]. The injection pressure consists of the capillary pressure across the
interface between the invading and defending Ô¨Çuid, and the combined viscous pressure loss in the
two Ô¨Çuids.
At high Ca, viscous pressure loss dominates and the injection pressure decreases monotoni-
cally as the more viscous defending Ô¨Çuid is pushed out by the less viscous invading Ô¨Çuid. This
decreasing trend in injection pressure is observed in all cases regardless of the wettability state of
the domain (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, the signature of wettability is evident even at the highest cap-
illary number (Ca = 510 4) ‚Äî the injection pressure is consistently higher in a purely oil-wet
13domain compared to a purely water-wet domain. These results agree with the injection pressure
measurements in uniform-wet microÔ¨Çuidic experiments [12]. The injection pressures observed in
mixed-wet domains fall between those in purely oil-wet and water-wet domains (Fig. 4a).
At low Ca, capillary pressure dominates and the injection pressure is controlled by the wettabil-
ity of the domain. Indeed, the injection pressure Ô¨Çuctuates around a mean positive value in a purely
oil-wet domain (i.e., drainage), but around a mean negative value in a purely water-wet domain
(i.e., imbibition). Closer inspection shows that the injection pressure Ô¨Çuctuations are larger in a
purely oil-wet domain than in a purely water-water domain (Fig. 4b, c). This difference in Ô¨Çuctu-
ations is attributed to the prevalence of burst invasion events in drainage, whose critical capillary
pressures are larger than those of touch and overlap invasion events, which are more prevalent in
imbibition [49, 57, 58].
Intuitively, at vanishingly small Ca, one would expect the injection pressure to Ô¨Çuctuate be-
tween the drainage capillary pressure and the imbibition capillary pressure in a mixed-wet domain,
as the invading water transits oil-wet and water-wet clusters. Surprisingly, this is not what we see
in mixed-wet domains with small fw‚Äî instead, we observe that the injection pressure Ô¨Çuctuates
between the drainage capillary pressure and some pressure that is much higher than the imbibition
capillary pressure (Fig. 4b). This deviation can be explained by the fact that once the invading wa-
ter encounters a water-wet cluster, all of the injected volume will preferentially enter that region
of the micromodel. Since the water-wet clusters are small at low fw, the preferential Ô¨Ålling within
this localized region will cause the defending Ô¨Çuid to redistribute along the invasion front, leading
to non-negligible viscous pressure loss even at very low Ca. Indeed, as the invading water enters
a water-wet cluster ( w= 30,fw= 20% ), the difference between the measured injection pres-
sure and the imbibition capillary pressure equal the viscous pressure in the defending oil (Fig. 4c).
Therefore, mixed-wettability could decrease the effective permeability of porous media at low Ca.
As the invading water exits the water-wet cluster, the injection pressure increases to the drainage
capillary pressure. Consequently, the period of the Ô¨Çuctuations indicates the size of the water-wet
cluster. At high fw, the invading water has access to many connected water-wet pores at any given
time, and the injection pressure closely tracks the imbibition capillary pressure (Fig. 4b).
Wettability index description of mixed-wet systems. Despite the complexities involved in fully
characterizing the wettability of mixed-wet systems (e.g., contact angles, wettability fraction, etc.),
it is sometimes helpful to approximate the wettability state of a porous medium by a single pa-
rameter. One of the simplest representations of this idea is the wettability index (WI), which in its
14general form is given by [34]

wherefiis the areal fraction of surface i,12is the interfacial tension between Ô¨Çuid 1 and Ô¨Çuid
2, andi1,i2are the interfacial tensions between surface iand the two Ô¨Çuids. Young‚Äôs equation
relates the interfacial tensions to the contact angle. For our mixed-wet system with two distinct
contact angles and oil-water as the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid pair, incorporating Young‚Äôs equation gives
WI=fwcosw+ (1 fw) coso: (9)
Therefore, WI is a weighted average description of the overall wettability of the porous media.
Here, we examine the effectiveness of WI in predicting the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement pattern as
characterized by the Ô¨Ånger width wfat low capillary number (Ca = 510 6). We Ô¨Ånd that WI
successfully collapses wfextracted from simulations conducted in more than 50 different mixed-
wet porous media. Additionally, this master curve matches the one obtained from simulations of
Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in uniform-wet porous media, which both show that Ô¨Ånger width increases
with increasing WI (Fig. 5a).
We take the weighted average description of Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in mixed-wet porous me-

Ca?alone is not able to capture the displacement pattern across different wettabilities, since
it does not account for the different types of invasion events (i.e., burst, touch, overlap). It is
well-known that overlap events promote cooperative pore Ô¨Ålling, which leads to more compact
displacement (i.e. wider Ô¨Ångers) [11, 12, 14, 44]. To capture the effect of cooperative pore Ô¨Ålling,
we calculate the dimensionless cooperative number ( Ncoop) for our system. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, Ncoop
evaluates the relative likelihood of overlap and burst events by comparing the critical capillary
pressures associated with the two invasion event types [13]. Ncoopfor a characteristic pore is given

CONCLUSIONS
We have investigated Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in simple mixed-wet porous media consisting of
distinct water-wet and oil-wet regions using a dynamic pore network model. We generate phase
diagrams of the displacement patterns for three different water-wet/oil-wet contact angle pairs
over a wide range of Ca (Fig. 2). The impact of mixed-wettability is most prominent at low Ca,
whose effect on the displacement pattern is controlled by the complex interplay between wetta-
bility fraction and the intrinsic contact angle of the water-wet regions (Fig. 3). Our simulations
also provide insights into the pressure signature of Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in mixed-wet porous
media, which displays Ô¨Çuctuations that cannot be explained by capillary pressure alone, even at
vanishingly small Ca (Fig. 4). We Ô¨Ånd that the injection pressure Ô¨Çuctuations are modulated by the
viscous pressure of the defending Ô¨Çuid due to preferential Ô¨Ålling of isolated water-wet regions, and
the duration of the Ô¨Çuctuations are determined by the size of the water-wet regions. One surprising
consequence of this complex interplay is that at low Ca, mixed-wettability could simultaneously
17result in reduced effective permeability, but more effective sweep of the defending Ô¨Çuid. Finally,
we derive scaling arguments based on a weighted average description of the overall wettability of
the mixed-wet porous medium, which effectively capture the variations in displacement pattern
morphology as characterized by the Ô¨Ånger width (Fig. 5). Our study presents a systematic under-
standing of the relationship between contact angle, wettability fraction, and capillary number in
governing Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid displacement in simple mixed-wet porous media, and it serves as a platform
upon which more complex mixed-wet porous media can be investigated.
APPENDIX A. MODEL GEOMETRY
In our system, the diameters of the posts follow a Gaussian-like distribution that ranges from
220 to 1700 m. Additionally, the pore-throat size follows a lognormal-like distribution that ranges
from 50 to 700 m.

APPENDIX B. CRITICAL INTERFACE CURV ATURE FOR BURST
Our aim here is to determine the critical interface curvature for a burst to occur in a typical
pore throat conÔ¨Åguration in the model. In this conÔ¨Åguration, the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface connects two
posts with diameters d(i.e., the median post diameter in the system) where the closest distance
between these posts is equal to a(i.e., the median pore throat size in the system). The wettability
of the posts is the same and their contact angles are equal to . After translation and rotation of the
coordinate system, the center of post A is positioned at (0;0)and the center of post B is located
at (a+d;0). Fig. 9 shows the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface arc_
CDwith the center of P(xp;yp)in the pore
18throat. We denote the distance between points A and P as d1, which is given by the law of cosine

We denote the distance between points B and P as d2, which is equal to d1.
As deÔ¨Åned in Primkulov et al. [14], a burst event occurs when the center of the Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid
interface has the following conÔ¨Åguration

whereX2is thexcoordinate of the center of post B, and it is equal to a+d. Solving equations

where ^l=d=a. The mean curvature of the interface at a burst event is deÔ¨Åned as = (1=rp+

critical interface curvature for a burst to occur is equal to
=2 cos

19DERIV ATION OF THE DIMENSIONLESS COOPERATIVE NUMBER
To determine whether a burst event precedes an overlap event in a pore throat, we deÔ¨Åne the
dimensionless cooperative number Ncoop. Fig. 8 shows two adjacent pore throats consisting of
three posts with similar diameter d, pore throat size aand contact angle which is the most
representative for our system. The angle between two neighboring interfaces \ABC is denoted
. We denote the angle between the line connecting points D and B and the line connecting A and
B as1. Similarly, we denote the angle between the line connecting point G and B and the line
connecting B and C as 2.
Increasing the pressure of the invading Ô¨Çuid advances the two adjacent interfaces within the
pore throat until they meet (i.e., an overlap event occurs). These two interfaces must satisfy the
geometric condition 1+2=[61]. To determine whether a burst event is preceded by an
overlap event, we must calculate 1and2corresponding to a burst event, and then calculate 
= (1+2): (20)
Here,>0indicates that 1+2<, and thus a burst occurs before the interfaces can overlap.
In contrast,  < 0suggests that 1+2> , which means that an overlap event will take place
and the interfaces merge and form a new Ô¨Çuid-Ô¨Çuid interface. Given that the pore throats in the
