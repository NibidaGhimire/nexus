Abstract
The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) began observing in late-2011 and has
been imaging the entire sky with nightly cadence since late 2017. A core goal of ASAS-SN is to
release as much useful data as possible to the community. Working towards this goal, in 2017 the
ﬁrst ASAS-SN Sky Patrol was established as a tool for the community to obtain light curves from
our data with no preselection of targets. Then, in 2020 we released static V-band photometry from
2013–2018 for61million sources. Here we describe the next generation ASAS-SN Sky Patrol,
Version 2.0, which represents a major progression of this eﬀort. Sky Patrol 2.0 provides continuously
updated light curves for 111million targets derived from numerous external catalogs of stars,
galaxies, and solar system objects. We are generally able to serve photometry data within an hour
of observation. Moreover, with a novel database architecture, the catalogs and light curves can be
queried at unparalleled speed, returning thousands of light curves within seconds. Light curves can be
accessed through a web interface ( http://asas-sn.ifa.hawaii.edu/skypatrol/ ) or a Python client
(https://asas-sn.ifa.hawaii.edu/documentation ). The Python client can be used to retrieve up
to 1 million light curves, generally limited only by bandwidth. This paper gives an updated overview
of our survey, introduces the new Sky Patrol, and describes its system architecture. These results
provide signiﬁcant new capabilities to the community for pursuing multi-messenger and time-domain
astronomy.
1.INTRODUCTION
The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae
(ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014; Kochanek et al. 2017a)
began observing in 2011 with the mission of identifying
bright transients across the whole sky with minimal ob-
servational bias. With its initial two-camera station at
the Haleakala Observatory (Hawaii), ASAS-SN was able
to image the visible sky roughly once every 5 days. By
late 2013, our team had installed two additional cameras
on the Haleakala station, by April 2014 we had installed
another two-camera station at the Cerro Tololo Interna-
tional Obervatory (CTIO, Chile), and by mid-2015 we
had installed two more cameras at the CTIO station.
These additional cameras increased our survey cadence
and allowed us to image the entire sky every few nights.

11DeceasedIn late 2017, we added three additional 4-camera sta-
tions, one at McDonald Observatory (Texas), one at the
South African Astrophysical Observatory (SAAO, South
Africa), and an additional station at CTIO. This geo-
graphic redundancy in both the northern and southern
hemispheres ensures that we are able to observe the en-
tire sky on a nightly basis. Our stations are hosted by
the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network
(LCOGT; Brown et al. 2013) and we have the ability
to download and reduce images within minutes of their
exposures.
ASAS-SN units use cooled, back-illuminated FLI Pro-
Line 2K2KCCD cameras with 14-cm aperture Nikon
telephoto lenses. The units’ ﬁeld-of-view is 4.47 degrees
on a side (20 degrees2) with a pixel size of 8.0 arcsec.
Ideally, each observation epoch consists of three dithered
90 second exposures, though we are currently averaging
2.7 exposures per epoch due to scheduling and weather
events. The two original units used V-band ﬁlters un-
til late 2018, after which we switched to g-band ﬁlters.
The three newer units have used g-band ﬁlters from the
start. The limiting V-band andg-band magnitudes are
m17:5andm18:5, respectively.
In June 2017, we launched Sky Patrol V1.0; https:
//asas-sn.osu.edu/ . The goal of Sky Patrol V1.0 was
to allow users to request light curves from our image
archive. Rather than pre-computing light curves for a set
number of targets, Sky Patrol V1.0 provides uncensored
light curves for any user-speciﬁed coordinates. Aperture
photometry is performed in real time at the user’s re-
quested coordinates using local, nearby stars to calibrate
the photometry. Though the ﬂexibility of that tool is
admirable, its need to compute light curves in real time
restricts both the size and frequency of users’ queries.arXiv:2304.03791v1  [astro-ph.IM]  7 Apr 20232
To partially alleviate these limitations, we pre-
computed static V-band light curves and released the
ASAS-SN Catalog of Variable Stars ( https://asas-sn.
osu.edu/variables ; Jayasinghe et al. 2018, 2019b,a).
We then expanded these catalogs to include 61.5 mil-
lion stars across the sky used in the variable star
search ( https://asas-sn.osu.edu/photometry ; Jayas-
ingheetal.2019c). Wehavealsocreatedacitizenscience
program using the Zooniverse12platform named Citizen
ASAS-SN (Christy et al. 2021, 2022b) where, as of Jan
1 2023,5;300volunteers have classiﬁed over 1,400,000
ASAS-SNg-band light curves through searches for un-
usual variable stars.
Finally, in September 2021, we further expanded Sky
Patrol V1.0 to not only perform forced-aperture photom-
etryonourreducedimagesbutalsotoenableuserstorun
aperture photometry on the coadded, image-subtracted
data for each epoch with or without the ﬂux of the source
on the reference image added.
This paper outlines Sky Patrol V2.0, which seeks to
maintain the ﬂexibility of its predecessor (which remains
available) while massively improving on it in both speed
andscale. V2.0notonlyservespre-computedlightcurves
for a select list of 111million targets, but it also con-
tinuously updates the light curves in real time. Like Sky
Patrol V1.0, they are uncensored light curves with no
deliberate delays in the updates. To do this, we have
built a system on top of our automated image processing
pipeline that performs photometry and updates our pub-
licdatabaseasnewobservationsareobtained, calibrated,
and reduced.
In §2, we describe our imaging pipeline and a number
of science products resulting from our survey. In §3, we
discuss our collated target list, their catalogs of origin,
and how they can be queried. In §4, we introduce the
Python and web interfaces to our dataset, and provide
several usage examples.In §5, we discuss the photometric
properties and precision of this survey tool. In §6, we
discuss the design and metrics of our database. In §7,
we give a short summary and explore the applications of
this tool in upcoming research.
2.SURVEY OVERVIEW
To date, our high-cadence network of telescopes has
produced millions of images. By repeatedly conduct-
ing observations in an all-sky ﬁxed grid, we are able to
leveragedeeplystackedreferenceimagestoperformhigh-
precisionphotometryandopticalanalysisforanumberof
diﬀerent science cases. This section describes our imag-
ing and photometry pipeline, as well as a variety of no-
table science products resulting from our survey’s data.
2.1. Photometry
To achieve full coverage of the sky the ASAS-SN ob-
servations are scheduled on 2,824 tessellated ﬁelds. Each
ﬁeld matches the 20 degree2camera ﬁeld-of-view and has
at least a 0.5 degree overlap with adjacent ﬁelds. The
ﬁelds are divided into 706 pointings, where each of the
4 cameras in an ASAS-SN unit observes a speciﬁc ﬁeld.
Figure 1 shows the our ﬁeld map and the number of im-
ages taken for each ﬁeld up to the time of writing.
12Zooniverse: https://www.zooniverse.org/Thedataareanalysedusingafully-automatedpipeline
based on the ISIS image-subtraction package (Alard &
Lupton1998;Alard2000). Eachphotometricepoch(usu-
ally) combines three dithered 90-second image exposures
with a 4.474.47 degree ﬁeld-of-view of the ﬁeld that
is subtracted from a reference image. Typically, within
an hour of observation our pipeline reduces and co-adds
the subtracted images together into observation epochs.
We then perform photometry on each of these co-added
subtractions and the reference image.
Thereferenceimagesarecalibratedusingisolatedstars
from the ATLAS Reference Catalog (Tonry et al. 2018)
and by ﬁtting a 2D polynomial to ﬁnd the zero point as
a function of XY position on each reference image. This
step reduces any leftover zeropoint issues not removed by
ﬂat ﬁelding.13After calibration, we perform photometry
on the reference image using IRAF apphot with a ﬁxed
aperture of 2 pixels, or approximately 16 arcsec, radius
andabackgroundannulusspanning7–10pixelsinradius.
We perform photometry on all targets from our input
catalogs that fall within each ﬁeld and are more than 0.2
degrees away from the image boundaries. We then use
apphoton the same apertures to perform photometry
on each subtracted image, generating a diﬀerential light
curve to which the reference ﬂux is added. Finally, the
photometry for each target in a given co-add is appended
to the corresponding light curves in our database.
For each epoch in a given light curve, we record the
Julian date, camera ﬁlter, FWHM, measured ﬂux, ﬂux
error, magnitude, magnitudeerror, and5 limitingmag-
nitude. Foranyepochwherethesourceisnotdetectedat
5, we still give the forced aperture ﬂux but report the
limiting magnitude instead of the magnitude and record
the magnitude error as 99.99.
Typically, we publish new photometric measurements
within an hour of observation. On the timescale of a
day, images are reviewed either manually or by addi-
tional quality checks for cirrus, clouds, or other image
quality issues. Images are then determined to be either
"good" or "bad." When this occurs, the corresponding
photometryisthenﬂaggedassuchintheSkyPatrolV2.0
database. We advise caution when using and interpret-
ing photometry that has not been ﬂagged as "good."
Because we are constantly appending new observations
to our light curves and periodically rebuilding reference
images—which triggers our pipeline to re-run all pho-
tometry on previous co-adds—our light curves are con-
sistently growing in length and improving in quality.
2.2. Science Products
The ASAS-SN survey was initially designed to cre-
ate a local census of nearby, bright extra galactic tran-
sients and has been used to discover and study super-
novae (e.g., Shappee et al. 2016; Holoien et al. 2016a,
2017c,b,a,d; Kochanek et al. 2017b; Bose et al. 2019;
Brown et al. 2019; Holoien et al. 2019b; Shappee et al.
2019a; Vallely et al. 2019; Neumann et al. 2022; Desai
et al. in prep.), superluminous supernovae (e.g., Dong
13This calibration scheme is diﬀerent than the image-
subtraction light curves available from Sky Patrol V1.0, which cal-
ibrate the reference only using stars near the source. This means
that the light curves provided from Sky Patrol V1.0 and Sky Patrol
V2.0 will not be identical.3

et al. 2016; Godoy-Rivera et al. 2017; Bose et al. 2018),
rapidly evolving blue transients (e.g., Prentice et al.
2018), tidal disruption events (TDEs; e.g., Holoien et al.
2014a, 2016a,b, 2018, 2019c,a, 2020; Brown et al. 2016,
2018; Hinkle et al. 2020, 2021b,a), ambiguous nuclear
transients (ANTs; e.g., Neustadt et al. 2020; Hinkle et al.
2021a; Holoien et al. 2022; Hinkle et al. 2022a), active
galactic nuclei variability (e.g., Yuk et al. 2022), orphan
blazarﬂares(deJaegeretal.2022a),largeoutburstsfrom
active galactic nuclei (e.g., Shappee et al. 2014; Trakht-
enbrot et al. 2019; Hinkle et al. 2022b; Neustadt et al.
2022), changing-look blazars (e.g., Mishra et al. 2021),
and even a potential repeating partial TDE (e.g., Payne
et al. 2021; Tucker et al. 2021; Payne et al. 2022a,b).
ASAS-SN has also been used to search for optical coun-
terparts for multi-messenger events such as high-energy
neutrinos observed by Icecube (e.g., Icecube Collabora-
tion et al. 2017; Garrappa et al. 2019; IceCube Collabo-
ration et al. 2018; Franckowiak et al. 2020; Necker et al.
2022) and LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave events (e.g.,
Abbott et al. 2020; Shappee et al. 2019b,c,d; de Jaeger
et al. 2022b).
Moreover, the ASAS-SN data have been used in hun-
dreds of publications to study Galactic and solar system
objects. This includes large variable star studies (Jayas-
inghe et al. 2018, 2019b,a; Pawlak et al. 2019; Jayas-
inghe et al. 2019c; O’Grady et al. 2020; Jayasinghe et al.
2021; Rowan et al. 2021; Christy et al. 2022b,a), deriving
period–luminosity relationships for Scuti stars (Jayas-
inghe et al. 2020b), ﬁtting detached eclipsing binaries pa-
rameters (Way et al. 2022; Rowan et al. 2022a,b), study-
ing contact binaries (Jayasinghe et al. 2020a), observing
accretingwhitedwarfsystems(e.g.,Campbelletal.2015;
Littleﬁeld et al. 2016), studying young stellar object vari-ability (e.g., Holoien et al. 2014b; Herczeg et al. 2016;
Rodriguez et al. 2016; Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2017; Gully-
Santiago et al. 2017; Osborn et al. 2017; Rodriguez et al.
2017; Bredall et al. 2020). Furthermore, ASAS-SN was
used to examine the long-term variability of Boyajian’s
Star (Simon et al. 2018) and has even recently identiﬁed
a potential new "Boyajian’s Star" analog (the source has
been nicknamed Zachy’s Star), exhibiting similar rapid
dimming events (Way et al. 2019). ASAS-SN data have
also been used to identify M-dwarf ﬂares (e.g., Schmidt
et al. 2014, 2016, 2019; Rodríguez Martínez et al. 2020;
Zeldes et al. 2021), Novae and CVs (e.g., Kato et al.
2014a,b, 2016, 2017; Li et al. 2017; Aydi et al. 2019,
2020a,b; Kato et al. 2020; Kawash et al. 2021a,b, 2022),
X-ray binaries (e.g., Tucker et al. 2018), and R Coro-
nae Borealis stars (e.g., Shields et al. 2019). ASAS-SN
data have also been used to study stars and exoplan-
ets by observing microlensing events (e.g., Dong et al.
2019; Wyrzykowski et al. 2020), determining asteroseis-
mic distances for M giants (e.g., Auge et al. 2020), deriv-
ing gyrochronologic ages for exoplanet host stars (e.g.,
Gilbert et al. 2020), and vetting exoplanet candidates
for background eclipsing binaries (e.g., Rodriguez et al.
2019). Finally, ASAS-SN data have even been useful
for solar system studies through asteroid shape model-
ing (e.g., Hanuš et al. 2020), discovering 2 new comets in
outburst (Prieto et al. 2017; van Buitenen et al. 2018),
and recovering the near-Earth asteroid 2019OK (Jacques
et al. 2019).
These studies demonstrate the wide utility of the
ASAS-SN network and its dataset and why we have cre-
ated a variety of tools which the community can beneﬁt
from.4
3.INPUT CATALOGS
Unlike ASAS-SN Sky Patrol V1.0, which allowed users
to request light curves at arbitrary points on the sky, Sky
Patrol V2.0 by construction only serves pre-computed
light curves for objects in our input catalogs. Our in-
put catalogs consist of stellar sources, external catalog
sources, and solar system sources. Objects in our stel-
lar source table and catalog source tables have all been
cross-matched to a precision of 2 arcseconds and given
unique ASAS-SN Sky Patrol Identiﬁers ( asas_sn_id14).
3.1. Stellar Sources
The stellar source table was constructed with the goal
of providing an unbiased sample that maximizes the
number of targets while maintaining the overall qual-
ity of our light curves. We used the ATLAS Reference
Catalog (REFCAT2) to build the target list. Given the
pixel size and magnitude sensitivity of our instruments,
we chose to include objects with mean g< 18:5mag and
where r1>20arcsec, where r1 is the radius where the
cumulative ﬂux exceeds that of the target star. Because
REFCAT2 was compiled to include at least 99% of ob-
jectswithm19magandcuratedtoexcludenon-stellar
objects, this stellar source table should be considered an
exhaustive list of all stars observable by ASAS-SN that
are not heavily crowded.
Because REFCAT2 used Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia
DR2) for its astrometric solutions, we were able to di-
rectly match Gaia source IDs from the given RA and
DEC coordinates. We then used the best-neighbour ta-
bles in the Gaia Archive to cross-match with AllWISE,
SDSS, and 2MASS. Finally, we used the same Gaia
source IDs to get TESS Input Catalog Version 8.0 (TIC)
IDs. This means that users can query our stellar source
table using either the original columns provided by REF-
CAT2 or by providing external catalog identiﬁers for any
of these other cross-matched surveys.
Wenotethatsomeofourexternalsourcecatalogtables
contain stellar objects that do not occur in the stellar
table. However, given the completeness of REFCAT2,
theseobjectstypicallyfalloutsideoursensitivityorsuﬀer
from signiﬁcant crowding.
3.2. Additional Catalog Sources
In addition to our stellar sources, Sky Patrol V2.0
provides light curves for a number of specialized cat-
alogs from NASA’s High Energy Astrophysics Science
ArchiveResearchCenter(HEASARC),asshowninTable
1. With the explicit goal of aiding multi-messenger as-
tronomywehaveincludedtheentiresourcecatalogsfrom
FermiLAT(Abdollahietal.2020), Chandra(Evansetal.
2010), and Swift (Nasa & Heasarc 2018). For researchers
interested in speciﬁc object and variable types we have
included the AllWISE AGN catalog (Secrest et al. 2015),
the Million Quasar Catalog (Milliquas; Flesch 2021),
the Brown Dwarf Catalog (Lépine & Gaidos 2011), the
AAVSO International Variable Star Index (Watson et al.
2006)andtheGalaxyListfortheAdvancedDetectorEra
(GLADE; Dálya et al. 2018).
Whereas our stellar sources were selected from REF-
CAT2 to ensure detections given our magnitude limits,
14Not to be confused with ASAS-SN Identiﬁers given to objects
discovered by our survey—e.g., ASASSN-15lh, ASASSN-14li, etc.these catalogs were not pruned based on ﬂux. Photom-
etry is performed at all target coordinates in these cat-
alogs without bias. As with the stellar sources, null de-
tections will be timestamped and reported in our light
curves with 99:99. Our interface allows the user
to query sources using all of the original columns of the
inputcatalogsand, wehavemaintainedtheoriginalnam-
ing conventions of the catalogs’ columns with few excep-
tions.
Becausemanysourcesappearinmorethanoneofthese
catalogs and we have already done the cross-matching,
users can perform JOIN operations on these tables using
asas_sn_id s. In §5, we provide several examples of such
queries in ADQL.
Finally, for a few of the catalogs, ASAS-SN spatial res-
olution is better than the accuracy of the catalog’s coor-
dinates for some of its objects. In these cases, we make
no eﬀort to identify the corresponding optical counter-
part and simply perform forced aperture photometry at
the catalog’s reported coordinates with our normal aper-
ture size. Thus, users must be cautious when using the
ASAS-SN Sky Patrol V2.0 photometry for poorly local-
ized sources. In these cases we recommend ﬁrst searching
for the corresponding optical counterpart’s photometry
in Sky Patrol V2.0, and if not present, to use the slower
Sky Patrol V1.0 to compute forced aperture photometry
at the exact coordinates desired.
3.3. Solar System Sources
To provide photometry for asteroids and comets, we
rely on updates from the Minor Planet Center Orbit
Database (MPCORB Database) every 10 days. For each
object in the most recent MPCORB Database relative to
our observation, we calculate the position and run aper-
ture photometry on all objects within that image. Unlike
our other sources, we do not add ﬂux from the reference
images. Photometry on asteroids is run with the same
aperture as our extra-solar sources, while comets are run
in a diﬀerent manner. Comet photometry is computed
using2–8pixelaperturesanda15–20pixelannulus. This
means that each comet’s light curve will have 7 diﬀerent
magnitude values for each observation epoch. The goal
of this regime is to provide researchers a detailed picture
of the growth and decay of gas and dust tails as these
comets traverse our solar system.
4.INTERFACE
We have designed a simple, yet powerful interface for
users to query objects from our input catalog tables and
to seamlessly retrieve their corresponding light curves.
This interface can be accessed through our Python client
orourwebportal. Whilethesehavesimilarfunctionality,
queries on the web portal will have stricter limits on the
number of sources returned in a single query. The web
portal limits users to 10,000 sources per query, whereas
thePythonclientallowsupto1millionsourcesperquery.
The latest version of the Python tool and documenta-
tion can be found at https://asas-sn.ifa.hawaii.
edu/documentation . The web portal can be accessed
athttps://asas-sn.ifa.hawaii.edu/skypatrol .
ASAS-SN Sky Patrol light curves can be queried in
a number of ways: cone searches, catalog IDs, random
samples, andADQLqueries. Furtherstatisticalandplot-
ting tools are also provided by the Python client. We5

4.1. Cone Search
The cone search is the most basic operation that we
allow. Users can provide RA, DEC, and a search ra-
dius, and obtain catalog entries and light curves for all
sources within that cone. Our system is unique in that
there is no limit on the radius of a cone search and that
the speed of the query will not be aﬀected by the size
of the cone. Users can also ﬁlter the desired sources in
their cone search by catalog. Moreover, our ADQL func-
tion set includes utilities for running cone searches in
conjunction with more complex queries. 

4.2. Catalog IDs
Searching by catalog ID is the simplest way to access
our data. To do this, the user can provide target IDs
for any catalog that we have cross-matched against and
our interface will return light curves for all the sources
in our data that match that list. Our stellar source table
can be queried with TESS, GAIA DR2, AllWISE, SDSS,
REFCAT2, and 2MASS identiﬁers. Sources from the
other catalogs can be queried directly by their survey
identiﬁers (e.g., Swift, Chandra, or Fermi LAT). 

This utility is meant for users that already have a
source list from a speciﬁc survey and that hope to use
our light curves to supplement their research. This is
also the fastest way to query our database.4.3. Random Samples
This utility has been included for data scientists look-
ing to train or test models on large unbiased samples
of light curves. The random sample function allows

4.4. ADQL Queries
While many other survey utilities, such as the Gaia
DR2 Archive and VizieR, run interfaces compliant with
the International Virtual Observatory Alliance’s (IVOA)
Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL) speciﬁca-
tion, we have chosen to use a custom grammar that both
adds functionality and simpliﬁes geometric queries15.
In addition to the query functionality of traditional
ADQL, we have included support for Common Table Ex-
pressions, WINDOW functions, correlated subqueries,
andUNIONS . We have removed the common geometry
functions such as BOX,CIRCLE ,AREA,POINT ,
andCONTAINS . Instead of building predicates out of
these functions, users can perform geometric searches ei-
ther using the DISTANCE function or by specifying
range conditions on RA and DEC. Below is an example
cone search16. 

Because our data is stored in decimal degrees, we have
providedfunctionstoentercoordinatesinHMSandDMS
formats as well as functions to give distance constants in
minutes and seconds of arc. Furthermore, because our
lookup tables are running on top of Apache Spark, users
can also leverage all of the Spark SQL functions17.
The ADQL interface can be queried at will and used
as a tool for exploring our source catalogs without any
requirement that the user downloads the corresponding
light curves. The speed of our execution engine allows
scientists to query data on multiple sources across our
input catalogs. However, users interested in the light
curvesforthesecatalogsourcesmustinclude asas_sn_id
as a column name in order to download the light curves.
4.5. Light Curve Utilities
The Python client provides additional functionality for
downloading and processing individual or collections of
light curves.

Once the user has found a set of targets through any
of the 4 catalog query functions, they can now download
their light curves. The cone search, catalog id, random
sample, and ADQL query functions all have a boolean
download parameter. If set, then the query function will
return a LightCurveCollection object. This object
provides the user with aggregate statistics on the col-
lected light curves.

5.PHOTOMETRIC PROPERTIES AND EXAMPLES
To demonstrate the photometric precision of the
ASAS-SNg-band photometry, we downloaded 1,000,000
random light curves from the stellar_main catalogue,
distributed over a range of Gaia DR2 magnitudes. For
each light curve, we removed bad ﬂuxes as indicated by
the quality ﬂags. We additionally normalized the ﬂux of
eachcameratounityandperforma5 clipping. Wethen
measured the standard deviation of the entire light curve
for each star. This metric is useful as a rough indication
of the photometric precision for the source. We show
the photometric precision of the g-band photometry as a
function of Gaia magnitude in Fig. 3.
As seen in Fig. 3, saturation in g-band begins to set
in aroundg12:5mag with the photometric precision
becoming signiﬁcantly worse around g11mag. At
the time of this publication, we suggest using Sky Patrol
V1.0 for signiﬁcantly saturated ( g<11:5mag) targets
to avoid the residuals that image subtraction creates for
suchsources. Futuredatareleasesweattempttoimprove
photometry for extremely saturated sources ( 5< g<
11:5mag).

try with several non-transient variable sources. For each8

are clear outliers that are not accurately captured by
the data quality ﬂags, there is no issue in recovering the
known periodicity of around 45 days despite its bright-
ness.
Figure. 5 demonstrates the exceptional baseline pro-
vided by ASAS-SN for an RR Lyrae variable star. Many
RR Lyrae are known to undergo a quasi-periodic mod-
ulation of their variability over time, referred to as
the Tseraskaya-Blazhko eﬀect (Buchler & Kolláth 2011).
Even in just the ASAS-SN g-band since 2017, this eﬀect
is easily visible.
Finally, Fig. 6 presents a sample of 10 randomly se-
lected eclipsing binaries found by Rowan et al. (2022b).
6.DATABASE METRICS
The construction of this database presented us with
a unique set of problems. Traditional survey data re-
leases have been of static data sets that lend themselves
to indexing and partitioning schemes that allow for fast
queries. However, Sky Patrol V2.0 is not a static data
release. Our light curves are updated in near-real time
as we gather new images from our stations. This has
forced us to decouple our lookup tables from their cor-
responding light curves. The lookup tables are kept as
in-memory distributed dataframes and the light curves
are kept on disk in a document store. Each of these ar-
chitectures has its own contribution to the speed of our
database.
Our in-memory lookup tables do not have pre-
calculated indexes on any of their columns. This is a
restriction of the software stack we are running. How-
ever, this means that we can load new catalogs on-the-
ﬂy with little penalty. Also, it means that each one of
our queries results in a full table scan. While this would
be untenable on disk-based storage, it is trivial for in-
memory storage. The major beneﬁt of this is that the
speed of our queries is not dictated by the complexity or
breadth of their ﬁlters, but rather by the number of re-
sults they return (i.e., bandwidth limitations). In other
words, users can run cone searches with arbitrary radius
with little to no penalty.
A major design goal of this architecture was to re-
turn all large queries to the lookup table—around 1 mil-
lion targets—in under a minute, and all small queries—
thousandsoftargets—inunder5seconds. Figure3shows
the cone search lookup speeds as a function of radii.
Thedocumentstoreusesouruniqueinternalidentiﬁers
as hash keys for each corresponding light curve. This
means we can retrieve light curves in O(1)time, so that
retrieval time grows roughly with the number of sources.
The speed of these retrievals is only limited by band-
width. Because the light curve documents contain far
more data than their corresponding rows in the lookup
tables, retrieval speeds will vary depending on the users
bandwidthandlatencyfromourserversattheUniversity
of Hawaii. In testing, downloads to Ohio State Univer-
sity ran at a rate of 1,000 light curves per minute per
core.9

7.CONCLUSION
ASAS-SN Sky Patrol V2.0 represents a major step for-
ward for survey data releases. While previous tools and
data releases have given users the ability to pull live pho-
tometry data or run complex searches across a collection
of input catalogs, few, if any, have managed to do both
at the speed and scale of this project. While Sky Pa-
trol V1.0 still allows users to run small numbers of light
curves anywhere on the sky, Sky Patrol V2.0 enables
users to perform studies using millions of light curves
that are continuously updated.
It is our hope that researchers can leverage our in-
put catalogs and light curves not only in their multi-
messenger and time-domain applications, but also in ser-
vice of standalone science applications. In regards to the
latter, this system will serve as the foundation for the
ASAS-SN team’s upcoming “Patrol” projects. Each of
these patrols will monitor incoming photometry data for
certain classes of objects—such as active galactic nuclei,
young stellar objects, cataclysmic variables, etc.—in or-
der to detect and study anomalous events in real time.
Finally, we are also investigating the possibility of al-
lowing individual users to create custom patrols where
the target list and triggering function would be created
by community members and run on the ASAS-SN data
stream in real time.
