Abstract
Complex intermetallic materials known as MAX phases exhibit exceptional properties from both metals and ceramics, largely
thanks to their nanolayered structure. With high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy supported by atomistic
modelling, we reveal atomic features of a nano-twist phase in the nanolayered Ti 3AlC 2. The rotated hexagonal single-crystal
is encompassed within basal symmetric twist interfaces similar to grain boundaries. In particular, we show that air-oxidation at
1000 ¬∞C can form a twisted phase that leads to the formation of interfacial dislocation networks with screw characters or to severe
interfacial reconstructions. Additionally, we explore the contribution of disclinations to the representation by continuum models of
the stress Ô¨Åeld generated by such nano-twist defect in the Ti 3AlC 2bulk phase. The occurrence of this unexpected defect is expected
to impact the physical response of this nanolayered-based material as such supports property-by-design approaches.
Ti3AlC 2belongs to the wide family of MAX phases [1].
These ternary compounds arise a keen interest, because they are
sti, lightweight, machinable, made from relatively inexpen-
sive raw materials, resistant to oxidation and thermal shock, and
capable of remaining strong up to temperatures above 1,300¬∞C
in air [2]. More than Ô¨Åfty compounds are thermodynamically
stable and all of them exhibit the same range of promising prop-
erties. Because of their composition, they were called M n+1AX n
phases ( n=1 to 3, M is a transition metal, A is an A-group el-
ement and X is nitrogen and /or carbon) [3].
As typical MAX phase, Ti 3AlC 2has a nanolayered struc-
ture with an hexagonal lattice, whose the space group is P63=mmc [2,
4]. The primitive cell can be described as a stacking of two Ti 6C
octahedron layers with one layer of Al [1]. Furthermore, mea-
surements of lattice parameters with numerous methods reveal
that Ti 3AlC 2exhibits elevated high crystalline anisotropy. The
c=aratio is slightly higher than 6 [5].
It is established, that MAX phases experience plastic de-
formation by the glide on basal planes of a-dislocations con-
Ô¨Åned between the M 6X and Al layers, thus forming pile-ups
and walls [6, 5, 7]. The latter can form local disorientation
areas, known as kink bands [8, 9]. Furthermore, numerous dis-
location interactions forming networks (dipoles, reactions) and
high lattice friction have been observed [10, 11]. Note, that out-
of-basal plane dislocations have been observed as well, but they
do not play a role at room temperature in standard deformation
conditions [12, 13]. At high temperature, it has been revealed,
that out-of-basal plane hai-dislocations are common events and
hence cross-slip (from basal planes to prismatic or pyramidal
planes) plays a key role in the deformation [14, 15]. This in-
antoine.guitton@univ-lorraine.frcrease of available glide systems is likely to originate the brittle-
to-ductile transition of MAX phases [14]. Note also that Frank
partialhci-dislocations correlated with a di usion mechanism
were recently reported [16]. Moreover, observations of stack-
ing faults is another major microstructural feature, but their role
in deformation both at room and high temperatures remains un-
clear [6, 13, 15].
Of all MAX phases, those containing Al, such as Ti 3AlC 2,
are the most resistant to oxidation [2]. During exposure of Ti‚Äì
Al‚ÄìC MAX phases to oxidizing environment at high tempera-
tures, the outward di usion of the weakly bonded Al atoms is
much faster compared to the more covalently bonded Ti atoms [2,
17, 18, 19]. Therefore, it results in a regime, where a superÔ¨Å-
cial protective layer of Al 2O3is formed. However, TiO 2can
be formed as well, leading, this time, to a catastrophic regime.
Both mechanisms are strongly depend on the oxidation condi-
tions and the initial microstructure [18, 19]. Despite the de-
scription of these oxides, operating oxidation mechanisms of
Ti3AlC 2and more generally of MAX phases remain poorly
documented, especially on how the crystallographic structure is
evolving. During decomposition of 312 MAX phases (such as
Ti3AlC 2, Ti3SiC 2) at high temperatures in an oxygen-containing
atmosphere or in species having a high a nity to A-element,
A-element is observed to de-intercalate, thus forming Ti 3C2
platelets [20, 21, 22, 23]. More precisely, in case of Ti 2AlC-
Cu composite, this de-intercalation of Al is associated with a
Frank partial dislocation-based mechanism [16]. This forma-
tion of Ti xCyplatelets is then viewed as reinforcement of the
composites [20].
Such is the background of the current letter. This work
is motivated by the analysis of original phases that were ob-
served after oxidation in a Ti 3AlC 2matrix by high-resolution
Preprint accepted in Scripta Materialia 7 November 2021arXiv:2303.09180v1  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  16 Mar 2023scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM). Such
nanolamellar phases appear to be twisted with respect to the
surrounding matrix and also associated with di usion mech-
anisms in its neighborhood. Hence, by interpreting our HR-
STEM observations using molecular dynamics simulations of
model nano-twist phases, we study their atomic scale features
including interfacial crystal defects, excess energy, and me-
chanical Ô¨Åelds. Concerning the latter, a continuous description
of the twist phase using a disclination based mechanical frame-
work is conducted complementary to atomistic simulations to
further evidence the complexity of such phases.
The specimen was prepared by hot isotropic pressing (HIP).
BrieÔ¨Çy, powders of Ti, Al and TiC were mixed in stoechiomet-
ric proportions 2Ti:1.05Al:0.85C and then cold-compacted into
cylindrical steel dies using an uniaxial pressure. Powder com-
pacts were encapsulated into pyrex containers under high vac-
uum for reactive sintering in the HIP machine. Afterwards, the
specimen were oxidized at 1000 ¬∞C for 25 h in a Ô¨Çowing air at-
mosphere. More details are given in [24, 19]. Cross-sectional
TEM samples were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) on a
FEI Helios dual beam Nanolab 600i. Atomically-resolved high-
angle annular dark Ô¨Åeld scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) was
performed on an Titan3G2 S/TEM Ô¨Åtted with a double aberra-
tion corrector for probe and image corrections and operating at
300 kV.
HR-STEM in HAADF mode of the lamella is shown in
Fig. 1 and at lower magniÔ¨Åcation in Fig. SM1 in supplemen-
tary materials. As HAADF detector senses a greater signal
from atoms with a higher atomic number Z, Ti columns appear
brighter in the resulting micrograph [25]. The nano-layered
structure of Ti 3AlC 2highlighted in the circular inset is con-
sistent with the expected one for a 312-MAX phase projected
along [ 11 2 0] i.e.zigzag stacking of three TiC planes followed
by one Al plane, the Al plane being the axis of symmetry of
the zigzag. Several large Ti xCylaths are clearly visible as well.
These sub-phases are probably similar to Ti 3C2phases as they
are formed by the di usion of the Al interlayers of the Ti 3AlC 2
phase. However, the experiments we used are not able to char-
acterize them precisely, and the mechanisms responsible for
their formation is out of the scope of this letter. The region
of interest shows blurred atomic layers (ROI, white square in
Fig. 1). The blur is along the [1 1 0 0] direction, localized within
the basal plane. This indicates that this part of the lattice has
undergone a rotation around the [0 0 0 1] direction. The bound-
aries between this rotated phase and the other phase are marked
with dashed white lines. Particular orientation relationships for
MX platelets in MAX interfaces have been reported in the lit-
erature [26, 27]. However, such orientations will not produce
the high-resolution contrast we observe in Fig.1, in particular,
the blurred atomic layer within the NTP. Note, that the upper
extremity of the ROI shows a large, blurred area and visible
inter-di usion between Al and Ti planes. Such mechanism that
induce severe local lattice strain might be responsible for the
dierence in the contrast of the Ti xCyphase on both side of the
NTP (Fig. 1).
To gain more insights on the observed defect and to char-
acterize precisely the structure of the twist boundary, we mod-

eled the nano-twist phase by atomistic simulations. Molecu-
lar dynamics (MD) based on interatomic potentials is an excel-
lent modelling method to investigate the atomic-scale conÔ¨Ågu-
ration of defects, in particular interfaces [28, 29]. It has been
widely used over the past decade to investigate grain bound-
aries [30, 31, 32, 33] and phase boundaries [34, 35, 36, 37]. The
only published model suitable to describe Ti 3AlC 2atomic inter-
actions is the bond-order potential (BOP) recently adjusted by
Plummer and Tucker [38]. It is based on the formalism initially
proposed by Terso [39] and described in detail by Albe et
al.[40]. Fig. 2 shows the atomistic simulation setup to com-
pute the energy and the structure of the rotated phase bound-
aries. Within a fully periodic bulk Ti 3AlC 2phase, a cookie
shape region in the center is rotated with an angle 	around
an axis normal to the basal plane, as indicated in blue in Fig. 2.
The inset shows as an example a rotation of the atomic struc-
ture for 	 = 3¬∞. Note that structures with similar contrasts to
HAADF-STEM ones can be obtained with di erent values of
	(Fig. 1).
It is important to mention that we do not intend here to
model the exact system observed in our experiments, for sev-
eral reasons. (1) The limitation of our experimental approaches
do not reveal the exact composition of the Ti xCyphase. (2)
The interaction potential used in our MD simulations has been
designed to model the Ti 3AlC 2phase and, thus, might be less
reliable for any non-stochiometric Ti xCyphase. (3) The local
atomic environment of the interface, up to three TiC interlay-
ers, is identical for both Ti 3AlC 2and Ti xCyphases. In this con-

in our MD simulations should inÔ¨Çuence the value of the inter-
facial energy, but will have a negligible impact on what is the
focus of our work: the energetic proÔ¨Åle and the crystallographic
structure of the interfaces. The consideration of idealized sys-
tems or surrogate materials is common practice with atomistic
simulations, including for direct comparisons with experimen-
tal results [35, 41, 37, 16].
The as-formed nano-twist phase (NTP) exhibits prismatic
and basal interfaces with the Ti 3AlC 2phase. The prismatic
interface is not clearly deÔ¨Åned in our experimental observa-
tion, whereas the basal interface appears atomically sharp (See
Fig. 1). In this work, we thus focus on the characterisation of
the NTP basal boundary (NTB). Fig. 3 shows the interfacial en-
ergy of the NTB as function of the twist angle 	. The energy
is computed by considering a cylindrical region in the center of
the NTP, that does not encompass the prismatic boundaries. For
each twist angle, the system is statically relaxed by using con-
jugate gradients and Ô¨Åre [42, 43] methods. The dimensions of
the box are adapted to ensure a globally stress-free system. The
energy of such as-relaxed NTB is shown with blue small dots in
Fig. 3. Selected conÔ¨Ågurations have been annealed at 600 K for
100 ps. A Nose-Hoover thermostat control the temperature and
a Nose-Hoover barostat ensure constant zero pressure. The sys-
tems are subsequently quenched and their energies are shown in
Fig. 3 with orange large dots.
The insets in Fig. 3 present the out-of-plane stress compo-
nentzzof the as-relaxed NTB for di erent 	. By showing
the distortion of the crystal lattice at the basal boundary, it re-
veals the structures of the interface. More details are presented
in Fig. 4 for 	 = 1¬∞, the smallest twist angle considered in
this work. The distortion of the crystal lattice at the NTB is
captured by the out-of-plane stress component zz(Fig. 4a,b).
This evokes the signature of an interfacial dislocation network,
with the three-fold symmetry of the basal plane and the nodes
of interacting interfacial dislocations. The atomic positions for
dierent basal interlayers shown in Fig. 4(c)(d) conÔ¨Årm this ob-
servation, as the relative displacement of the atoms is character-

istic of screw dislocations.
The NTP we observed experimentally is not a grain on it-
self, but is located within one crystallographically homogeneous
area containing perfectly coherent Ti 3AlC 2and Ti xCyphases.
The phase Ti xCybeing directly issued from the Ti 3AlC 2phase,
this area can be considered as a Ti 3AlC 2-base grain. This nano-
phase exhibits limited degree of freedom, with its twist axis and
at least one interface being precisely deÔ¨Åned: the hciaxis and
the basal planes, respectively. It is clear that the basal interface,
we called NTB, shares similarities with pure twist grain bound-
aries, such as (1) an interfacial energy evolution with a typi-
cal bell-shape, (2) an interfacial structure that can be described
by a network of screw dislocations lying on basal planes and
cross-sliping to 1st-order prismatic planes (consistent with pre-
vious experimental observations [14]) for low twist angles, (3) a
spacing between interfacial dislocations inversely proportional
to low twist angle values and (4) a description of the interface in
term of dislocations network that vanished for high twist angles.
The transition from a low angle conÔ¨Åguration to a high angle
conÔ¨Åguration is for 	15¬∞ (Fig. 3, insets). However, the NTB
also exhibits clear di erences towards grain boundaries, namely
(1) only one macroscopic degree of freedom (DoF) instead of
Ô¨Åve for grain boundaries and (2) interfacial reconstructions for
high twist angle leading to non-monotonous structural patterns.
Interestingly, such NTP were already reported by Drouelle
et al. in Ti 3AlC 2deformed by creep at high temperature. In-
deed, they observed by conventional TEM, highly disorganized
lenticular defects with a very high density of screw disloca-
tions [15]. In addition, Zhang et al. reported low-angle twist
grain boundaries (disorientation around 0 :5¬∞) in Ti 3AlC 2com-
pressed uniaxially at 1200 ¬∞C [44]. Such sub-grain boundaries
are formed by screw dislocation networks originating from basal
dislocation reactions, like those predicted here in Fig. 4.a. Both
studies conclude that such features may play a role in the plas-
ticity of Ti 3AlC 2.
It is worth noticing that, within the time frame considered
by our atomistic simulations, neither the interfacial energy nor

the interfacial structure is signiÔ¨Åcantly altered by annealing.
The conÔ¨Åguration of the NTB predicted by atomistic modelling
appears as such stable.
For high twist angles ( 	>15¬∞), the interfacial conÔ¨Ågu-
ration exhibits severe reconstructions. By comparison to con-
Ô¨Ågurations with low twist angles, this reconstruction releases
localized atomic stresses but does lead to lower interfacial en-
ergies. Interfacial energies for tilt and twist boundaries in crys-
tals with cubic structures often show clear drops for particu-
lar	values that correspond to high symmetry misorientations.
Yet, such stable high angle conÔ¨Åguration are not observed with
the NTB investigated in this work. This can be related to the
limited DoF accessible to this boundary, as described in the fol-
lowing. Grain boundaries are classically considered within the
coincidence site lattice theory (CSL), which predict periodic
interfaces for particular misorientation. As such, they are de-
Ô¨Åned by Ô¨Åve macroscopic DoF (directions and rotation), among
which some lead to particularly stable conÔ¨Ågurations with low
interfacial energy. Additionally, it is known that considering the
microscopic DoF (translation) accessible to any grain bound-
aries is crucial to fully determine the most stable conÔ¨Ågura-
tions. However, the NTB we observed does not have so many
DoF. In particular, the NTP being conÔ¨Åned within a well deÔ¨Åned
bulk Ti 3AlC 2phase, it does not allows the NTB for translation
DoF. Allowing the NTB for microscopic DoF might thus lead
to lower energy conÔ¨Ågurations. This is out of the scope of the
present work, which is focused on the characterization of theNTP we observed experimentally.
For large angles 	, the NTB cannot be conveniently de-
scribed by dislocations anymore as discussed above and illus-
trated in the insets of Fig. 3. We propose that for high-angles of
rotation, the NTB can be appropriately represented by disclina-
tion loops. As the rotational counterpart of dislocations, discli-
nations are line defects which introduce a discontinuity of the
elastic rotation Ô¨Åeld, referred to as the Frank vector. The con-
cept of disclinations is appropriate for the description of elastic
Ô¨Åelds of tilt boundaries with high misorientations [45] and for
nanotwin microstructures [46, 47]. Regarding the cookie shape
NTP considered in this work, the stress Ô¨Åeld due to the net-
work of overlapping dislocation arrays can be equivalently and
more simply described by using two disclination loops delim-
iting the NTP. Such representation was succesfully applied for
nanolamellar twins with tilt misorientations [47]. Here, we pro-
pose to apply this concept to twist interfaces with high misori-
entations, which has never been attempted so far to our knowl-
edge. More details can be found as Supplementary Material.
As shown in Fig. 5(a), a NTP with misorientation 30is
modelled by a dipole of twist disclination loops with Frank
vector magnitude 30about the Z ([0 0 0 1]) axis. A recent
Ô¨Åeld disclination mechanics framework is used to built this loop
dipole [45, 47]. The two main Cauchy stress tensor compo-
nents predicted by the model are shear stresses xzandyz. The
latter are characteristic of screw dislocation out of plane shear
stresses and clearly arise from the twist rotation discontinuity
applied within the NTB.
Fig. 5(b) shows xzandyzas predicted by atomistic sim-
ulations and evidenced a fair match with what is predicted by
the disclination model in Fig. 5(a). The similarities are (1) the
morphology of the surrounding stress Ô¨Åeld maxima with two
inverse dipoles in a particular crystallographic direction, and
(2) the magnitude of these stress dipoles around 1 GPa. This
match between atomistic and continuum representation is how-
ever partial. The di erences are (1) the direction of stress max-
ima rotated by 90¬∞, and (2) stresses within the NTB predicted
by MD but not by the disclinations. These di erences clearly
originate from characteristics not considered by the disclina-
tion based model. Typically, dislocation cores e ects are only
considered by atomistic modelling and leads to zzeigenstrains.
Additionally, the reconstruction of the NTB for high twist an-
gles we observed by MD, appears to play a crucial role in the
distribution of the stress Ô¨Åeld. Disclination based models will
have to be enriched to consider such atomistic mechanisms,
but they are yet much promising to model general interfaces
in complex materials at the continuum scale.
Regarding the formation mechanism of the NTP, our pre-
liminary observations suggest a strong inÔ¨Çuence of the Ti-Al
diusion in the basal planes at the onset of the NTB. The dif-
fusion could be favoured by the interfacial dislocation network
that locally induce a variation of free volume within basal planes.
The exact impact of a nano-twist phase on the properties of
the Ti 3AlC 2nanolayered structure is yet unclear. But it seems
that they are not anecdotal events, as reported in [18, 44]. Simi-
larly to what has been observed with the formation of Frank par-
tial dislocations [16], the interfacial dislocation network could

limit the propagation of haidislocations and thus participate to
the strengthening of Ti 3AlC 2phases. The prismatic interfaces
of the NTP would require more investigations as they should
play an important role by hindering the propagation of basal
dislocation more e ciently than the basal interfaces. From a
more general perspective, nano-twist crystals have been shown
to exhibits peculiar optical properties [48].
Additional investigations are ongoing to gain a comprehen-
sive understanding on the formation mechanisms of this nano-
twist phase, in order to opens up new possibilities for tailored
properties MAX phases.
