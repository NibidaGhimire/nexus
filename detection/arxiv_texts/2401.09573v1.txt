The Schwinger oscillator construct of angular momentum, applied to the superconducting trans-
mon and its transmission-line readout, modeled as capacitvely coupled quantum oscillators, pro-
vides a natural and robust description of a qubit. The construct defines quantum-entangled,
two-photon states that form an angular-momentum-like basis, with symmetry corresponding to
physical conservation of total photon number, with respect to the combined transmon and read-
out. This basis provides a convenient starting point from which to study error-inducing effects of
transmon anharmonicity, surrounding-environment decoherence, and random stray fields on qubit
state and gate operations. Employing a Lindblad master equation to model dissipation to the sur-
rounding environment, and incorporating the effect of weak transmon anharmonicity, we present
examples of the utility of the construct. First, we calculate the frequency response associated with
exciting the ground state to a Rabi resonance with the lowest-lying spin-1/2 moment, via a driving
external voltage. Second, we calculate the frequency response between the three lowest two-photon
states, within a ladder-type excitation scheme. The generality of the Schwinger angular-momentum
construct allows it to be applied to other superconducting charge qubits.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Jaynes-Cummings model [1] was originally conceived to study spontaneous emission
and absorption of photons by atoms isolated in a cavity, with the intent to understand
stimulated emission of microwaves via coherent amplification in masers [2]. The model
has since been adapted to a superconducting transmon, for example, to describe a qubit
defined by the two lowest-lying (ground and excited) photon states, assuming these states
are sufficiently isolated from higher-lying states [3]. In this circuit quantum electrodynamics
(CQED) model, the qubit (the simulated atom) is capacitively or inductively coupled to
a transmission line (the resonator cavity), modeled as a linear quantum oscillator, and
driven by an externally applied time-varying field (the interaction). The full quantum wave
function of the open transmon-resonator system is estimable in terms of a basis of two-
photon equilibrium states constructed from products of transmon and resonator equilibrium
states. Usually a transformation of the time-dependent Hamiltonian via the interaction

2picture is made [4], from which a rotating-wave approximation of the driving term can
be inferred [5], followed by a transformation of slow-rotation terms to a time-independent
Hamiltonian, when possible [6]. Regardless of the set of techniques employed in its solution,
the Jaynes-Cummings model has proven invaluable to the understanding of superconducting
charge-qubit dynamical behavior.
However, the application of the Jaynes-Cummings model in this simplest form has draw-
backs. For example, as mentioned, the two lowest-lying states must be in isolation from
those above, which is not always strictly viable, requiring multilevel extensions to the model
[3]. Examples of such multilevel cQED calculations can be found in the literature [7]. Also,
the strength and relative positions of energy levels, between qubit and resonator, must be
engineered to affect as little change on the qubit state during readout as possible, which
is counter to the unavoidable intrinsic photon entanglement of the combined transmon and
resonator. These issues complicate the definition of the qubit and introduce sources of error
in measurement of its coherent state, as well as gate operations applied to it. An alternative
is to exploit the tandem design of transmon and resonator, by leveraging the Schwinger
oscillator model of angular momentum to construct a more robust definition of the qubit [8],
one rooted in the intrinsic entanglement of the photons, regardless of states excited during
operation. This does not change the physics of the device. Instead, it offers a more complete
perspective of state entanglement, within the combined transmon and resonator, which can
aid device design with respect to quantum decoherence and sources of gate error.
Many years ago J. Schwinger recognized the equivalence between the Lie algebra of anni-
hilation and creation operators, of two adjoining linear quantum oscillators, and the algebra
of angular momentum [8]. This inference has utility in elementary particle physics as a means
of demonstrating the property of nuclear isospin, and how it emerges from the entanglement
of up and down quarks [9]. This same idea can be applied to the transmon and resonator
tandem as well, where both are modeled as full quantum oscillators, allowing for a robust
definition of a metric of entanglement, wherein the qubit is a naturally emergent property
of the transmon and resonator. However, like nuclear isospin, a qubit defined in this way is
not a physical observable of angular momentum, though it possesses the same properties of
wave-function construction, operator commutation, and operator addition. Moreover, it is
not relegated to a specific spin quantum number, such as spin 1/2, since it is not mapped
to a specific state excitation.
3Most importantly, the Schwinger construct introduces angular-momentum-like symmetry
to the combined transmon and resonator, based on an underlying conservation of total
photon number, N. Specifically, as we shall see, Ndictates the spin quantum number, S,
where S=N/2. This creates an analogy with the simulated atom, as in the original intent
of the Jaynes-Cummings model, defining specific angular-momentum-based selection rules
that govern allowed state transitions, assuming a fixed value of N. In this way, the angular
momentum symmetry becomes a baseline from which to study sources of measurement error,
particularly for the transmon, for which anharmonicity is relatively weak compared to other
charge qubits. From the point of view of the Schwinger construct, sources of error, such
as transmon anharmonicity or stray stochastic fields, are symmetry breaking mechanisms
that respectively can cause Nto be perturbed from an integer value or cause it to fluctuate
randomly, manifestly as noise-induced error.
In this study we define the Schwinger qubit construct and, as an example application,
apply it to an analysis of transmon excitation, introducing a Lindblad master equation to
address dissipation with the surrounding environment [10]. First, we calculate the Rabi res-
onance between ground state and first (spin-1/2) excited state as a function of the strength
of capacitive coupling between transmon and resonator. Second, among the three lowest
energy states of combined transmon and resonator, we calculate the two Rabi resonances
of a ladder-type frequency-response scheme, showing the viability of this scheme to indi-
rectly excite the third (spin-1) state. Last, we conclude with some final remarks regarding
symmetry breaking and the exposure of the superconducting transmon to one-half noise.
II. THEORY
We first present the model Hamiltonian of the combined transmon and resonator. We
then define the qubit of this Hamiltonian via the Schwinger oscillator model of angular
momentum. Last, we introduce the voltage driving term and the Lindblad master equation,
whose solution is used to calculate the expectation value of the qubit. Additional details
can be found in the accompanying Supplemental Material [11].
4A. The Transmon and Resonator Hamiltonian
We model a superconducting transmon of charging energy ECand Josephson energy
EJas an anharmonic quantum oscillator, where the cosine of the superconducting phase
is expanded as a Taylor series, in a Duffing approximation, and the offset charge number
is assumed negligible or otherwise removable from the resulting Hamiltonian. Denoting
the transmon oscillator ladder by index −, its fundamental frequency is ω−=√8ECEJ/ℏ.
Similarly, representing the resonator as a linear quantum oscillator of self inductance Land
capacitance C, and denoting its ladder by index +, we have a fundamental frequency of
ω+= 1/√
LC. With the two oscillators capacitively coupled via parameter g, the second-
quantized Hamiltonian can be expressed as

The length S=N/2, proportional to total number operator N, is a good quantum number
in the absence of nonlinear (anharmonic) terms in Ho. The Cartesian operator components
Sx,Sy, and Sz, whose expectation values define the qubit, satisfy the usual commutation
relations of angular momentum, i.e., [ Sj, Sk] =iϵj,k,lSl, where j, k, l∈ {x, y, z}andϵj,k,l
is a Levi-Civita coefficient. This result follows from the commutation relations of aσand
a†
σ. Similarly, via an inverse canonical transformation, the Schwinger angular momentum
components also can be expressed in terms of aµanda†
µ, with preservation of [ Si, Sj] =
iϵi,j,kSk.
In the linear limit of (2), eigenstates are two-particle states |n↑⟩ ⊗ |n↓⟩, where aσ|nσ⟩=
√nσ|nσ−1⟩anda†
σ|nσ⟩=√nσ+ 1|nσ+ 1⟩, with eigenvalues En↑,n↓=P
σℏωσ(nσ+ 1/2).
In this limit, angular momentum states are identical to two-particle energy eigenstates, but
with reordered indexing, such that an angular momentum state is of the form
|S, m S⟩=a†
↑S+mS|0⟩ ⊗a†
↓S−mS|0⟩p
(S+mS)! (S−mS)!, (6)
where |0,0⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩is the vacuum state, length S= (n↑+n↓)/2 = 0 ,1/2,1, . . ., and
quantum number mS= (n↑−n↓)/2 =−S,−S+ 1, . . . , S −1, S. Thus, |S, m S⟩is an
eigenstate of the linear Hamiltonian, with eigenvalue ℏξS,mS, where

6Since operators S±of (4) are legitimate angular momentum operators, we also have the
identities
S±|S, m S⟩=p
(S∓mS) (S±mS+ 1)|S, m S±1⟩, (8)
as the reader can verify. Note that states |S, m S⟩of (6) are symmetric since the particles of
the combined oscillators are bosons.
An important point to note is that the Schwinger construct introduces selection rules
via the angular-momentum symmetry, associated with constant N. To see this, consider
defining the nonlinear terms of Hoof (2) as

Let two-photon eigenstates of Hobe denoted by |ψk⟩, with indexes k= 1,2, . . ., such
thatHo|ψk⟩=ℏϵk|ψk⟩, where ℏϵkis an eigenstate energy. For the transmon, where the
anharmonicity is weak, i.e., EC≪12ℏω↓, we can use standard Rayleigh-Schr¨ odinger time-
independent perturbation theory [13] to evaluate |ψk⟩andϵk, using the states |S, m S⟩of (6)
as a basis.
In Fig. 1(b) we plot the relative magnitude of the matrix elements ⟨ψk|∆Ho|ψk′⟩, for
k, k′= 1,2, ...,(S+ 1) (2 S+ 1), as a heat map, evaluating ⟨ψk|and|ψk′⟩to second order in
the perturbation expansion, using a subset of states |S, m S⟩, up to S= 3. The plot shows the
relative magnitude of each element by row ( k) and column ( k′), where white space denotes
a magnitude of zero. Rows kand columns k′are indicated on the right and bottom edges of
the heat map, respectively. The left and top edges of the heat map are labeled with the spin
quantum numbers most closely identifiable (from the perturbation theory) with indexes k
andk′. The elements ⟨ψk|∆Ho|ψk′⟩are shown to form well-defined blocks of non-zero sub
matrices according to the value of spin S, with large non-zero magnitudes aligned in bands
parallel to the matrix diagonal.
In zero order of the perturbation expansion, only blocks of matrices along the diagonal—
rows and columns of the same value of S—would be non-zero. In second order of the
perturbation theory, however, we see from the figure that non-zero blocks extend to bands
on either side of the non-zero diagonal blocks, but only for sub matrices where the row-
value of Sand the column-value of Sdiffer by an integer value. This indicates that, for
the superconducting transmon, atom-like selection rules apply, even in the presence of weak
anharmonicity. In this specific situation, allowed state transitions are associated with integer

8change in the value of spin; half-integer changes in spin are essentially forbidden. Hence,
since S=N/2, this means that the transmon tends to be robust against changes in Nthat
involve an odd number of photons, such as those associated with random one-half noise
events. In contrast, changes in Nby an even number of photons include events such as
pairwise adiabatic, elastic collisions that conserve linear momentum, as when the transmon-
resonator system is subjected to a coherent applied voltage.
Lastly, we show the form of energy levels ℏϵkcalculated from the second-order pertur-
bation theory. Specifically, in Fig. 1(c), we plot the two-photon ϵk, measured in GHz, as a
function of capacitive coupling strength g, also measured in GHZ, for the first four energy
levels. The dashed curves are the zero-order, unperturbed values—the same as (7)—plotted
for comparison with the solid-curve, second-order estimates of ϵk. The curves are labeled
by the kets of their zero-order correspondences. Note that the purple solid curve ( |1,−1⟩)
is lower in value than that of the green solid curve ( |1
2,1
2⟩), a juxtaposition indicative of an
avoided crossing, resulting from the anharmonicity.
C. The Driving Voltage and Lindblad Master Equation
We model the interaction of the qubit with an externally applied field by introducing a
time-dependent energy term U(t) =−q+V(t), where V(t) is the driving voltage and q+is
the charge of the resonator. As derived in Section III of the Supplemental Material [11],
U(t) can be expressed in second-quantized form, within the canonical representation, as

In this way, the Hamiltonian is modified to an open time-dependent form H(t) =Ho+U(t).
Additionally, to complete the description of the open system, we model the interaction of
transmon and resonator with the surrounding environment via a Lindblad master equation
[10], where γ′
µandγµare diffusion and dissipation rates, respectively, between environment
and resonator ( µ= +), and environment and transmon ( µ=−). As alluded to earlier,
in Fig. 1(a), we assume |˜g| ≪4ωµ, such that, to first approximation, we can neglect diffu-
sion and dissipation directly between transmon and resonator. The canonical form of the

In practice, we solve (12) in component form by defining matrix elements of ρ(t) using
the energy states |ψk⟩ofHoas a basis, calculated from the second-order perturbation theory
described earlier. We then have matrix elements ρk,k′(t) =⟨ψk|ρ(t)|ψk′⟩, as well as Θ k,k′=
⟨ψk|Θ|ψk′⟩for Θ of (11), and Ak,k′(σ, s) =⟨ψk|Aσ,s|ψk′⟩for jump operator Aσ,s. We also
truncate the infinite set of coupled differential equations to only those that interact strongly
with V(t), labeling this finite set of states by E. In this way, we set ρk,k′(t) = 0 unless
k, k′∈E, such that the component form of (12) is approximated as

10III. RESULTS
In the following calculations we use the parameters listed in Table I, unless otherwise
stated. For concreteness, regarding the resonator, we take the self inductance to be L=
10.0 pH and the capacitance to be C= 1.0 nF, such that ω+= 1/√
LC= 10.0 GHz. For the
transmon we assume EJ/EC= 50 and take ω−= 5.0 GHz, which requires EC= 0.165µeV
andEJ= 8.24µeV. Also, we set the diffusion and dissipation rates of (12) to values that
correspond to coherence times in the range of 100 µs, allowing the resonator to be more
interactive with the surrounding environment than the transmon, with γ′
+= 100 kHz,
γ+= 10.0 kHz and γ−= 10.0 kHz, γ−= 1.0 kHz.
We first present results for excitation of the ground state to the lowest-lying excited state
of the transmon-resonator system, corresponding to an induced qubit of spin-1/2, near the
Rabi resonance frequency, using a single-tone applied voltage. This calculation uses the two
lowest-lying energy levels plotted in Fig. 1(c). In this analysis we derive the coherence time
of the qubit, which we set, via Table I, to correspond to about 100 µs. Also, we extend
the two-state calculation to consider the frequency response as a function of increasing g.
In a second set of results, we apply a two-tone voltage and explore the excitation of the
ground state to the two lowest-lying states, of spin-1/2 and spin-1, respectively, within a
Rabi resonance calculation corresponding to a three-state, ladder-type frequency-response
scheme. Again, we make use of Fig. 1(c), but in this case using the three lowest-lying energy
levels. This three-state resonance calculation demonstrates the excitation of the Schwinger
qubit to a superposition that includes the spin-1/2 and spin-1 states.
A. A Single-Tone Two-State Rabi Resonance Calculation
We first considered the solution of (14) for a Rabi resonance between the two lowest-
lying states, for which E={1,2}. In this case, a single-tone voltage, V(t) =Vosin Ωt, with
Vo= 1.0 nV, was applied for values of pump frequency Ω ≈ϵ2,1, where ϵ2,1=ϵ2−ϵ1. Since
transmon anharmonicity is weak, we made a first approximation of coefficients Θ k,k′and
Ak,k′(σ, s), and thereby Λ(l,l′)
k,k′, by taking |ψ1⟩∼=|0,0⟩and|ψ2⟩∼=|1/2,−1/2⟩. For the two
eigenvalue energies, we used (7) such that ϵ1∼=ξ0,0andϵ2∼=ξ1/2,−1/2.
Applying a Runge Kutta numerical method, we solved the four coupled differential equa-
11tions to obtain the solution presented in Fig. 2. With Ω ∼=ϵ2,1, corresponding to detuning
of 50 kHz, panels (a) and (b) of the figure show the real and imaginary parts of ρ1,2(t) as a
function of t, respectively, while panel (c) displays the solution of ρ2,2(t) as a function of t.
The other two elements of the density matrix are ρ2,1(t) =ρ1,2(t)∗andρ1,1(t) = 1−ρ2,2(t).
Also, using (16), we plotted the z-component of the induced spin-1/2 qubit in panel (d),
⟨Sz(t2)⟩∼=−ρ2,2(t)/2, where t2= 100 µs, as a function of pump frequencies centered about
the Rabi frequency; the xandycomponents of spin are zero and not displayed.

numerical solution while the red is the asymptote of the steady-state limit, as t→ ∞ , as discussed
in the text. (d) Plot of Runge-Kutta estimated ⟨Sz(t2)⟩, where t2= 100 µs, as a function of the
frequency of the driving voltage, Ω. Model parameters used to generate the results are described
in the text.
An approximate solution applicable to the steady-state, i.e., as t→ ∞ , is derived in
Section V of the Supplemental Material [11]. In this approximation the off-diagonal density-
matrix elements are purely oscillatory as a function of t, ast→ ∞ , with an asymptotic form

where τis a coherence time, with τ∼=100.0µs in the present calculation. Equation (21)
is similar in form to that obtainable from the Bloch equation of motion [14], except here
τis a single relaxation time governing the Lorentzian half-width, as opposed to the two
longitudinal and transverse relaxation times of the Bloch equation. Dubois et al. [15]
have shown how the Bloch-like result follows from a specific semi-classical treatment of the
Lindblad master equation. In the present quantum-limit result, (17) through (21) are most
applicable when t≫τ.
As a last part of the analysis of the two-state excitation, we consider the Rabi resonance
as a function of increasing g, using second-order perturbation theory to estimate |ψ1⟩and
|ψ2⟩, as well as ϵ1andϵ2. Specifically, in Fig. 3, we plot the Runge-Kutta calculation of
⟨Sz(t)⟩as a function of Ω for several increasing values of g, starting from g= 5 GHz in
13FIG. 3. Plot of ⟨Sz(t2)⟩, where t2= 100 µs, as a function of driving frequency Ω, for several
values of capacitive coupling parameter g, as indicated in the figure. Model parameters used to
generate the results are described in the text.
panel (a). Note that Fig. 2(d), of our previous calculation, and the new Fig. 3(a) differ only
in the estimate of |ψ1⟩,|ψ2⟩,ϵ1, and ϵ2. The greatest difference between the two plots is
the resonance-frequency downward shift, by about 300 MHz, in Fig. 3(a), attributable to
inclusion of the second-order perturbation.
With second-order perturbation theory applied in Fig. 3, we are able to capture an avoided
crossing involving the third and fourth energy levels, as discussed earlier with respect to
Fig. 1(c). Also, we assume the resonator interacts more strongly with the surrounding
environment than does the transmon, with diffusion and dissipation rates given in Table I.
These factors allowed us to explore more fully the interplay between transmon-resonator
states and polaritons that form in the presence of the driving voltage [16], particularly as
we increase g.
In Fig. 3, as we increase gfrom g= 5.0 GHz, in panel (a), to g= 10.0 GHz, in panel (b),
a gap initially opens in the frequency-response spectrum centered about Ω = ˜ ϵ2,1, indicative
of transparency at that frequency, with ˜ ϵ2,1shifting lower as gincreases. At g= 10.0 GHz,
the transparency is nearly maximal, but as gincreases we see a non-monotonic character
14to the transparency, with an increasing number of sidebands appearing in the frequency
response, which tend to overwhelm any apparent gap. For example, when g= 500 MHz in
Fig. 3(d), the transparency has essentially disappeared.
B. A Two-Tone Three-State Rabi Resonance Calculation
We next consider the solution of (14) for Rabi resonances between the three lowest-lying
states, for which E={1,2,3}. In this situation, matrix coefficients Θ k,k′=⟨ψk|Θψk′⟩, of
the operator defined in (11), couple the applied voltage to the two excited states, |ψ2⟩and
|ψ3⟩. However, since Θ 1,3= Θ 3,1= 0, there can be no direct excitation of state |ψ3⟩from
the ground state. To overcome this forbidden transition, a ladder scheme can be employed
to excite |ψ1⟩ → | ψ2⟩and|ψ2⟩ → | ψ3⟩. This is accomplished by applying a two-tone voltage,
V(t) =Vpsin Ω pt+Vcsin Ω ct. Here we set Vp= 0.5 nV and Vc= 1.0 nV, and adjust the
two frequencies to obtain Rabi resonances Ω p≈ϵ2,1and Ω c≈ϵ3,2, where ϵk,k′=ϵk−ϵk′. For
our calculations, we set the detuning to 50 kHz for both Rabi resonances. The states |ψk⟩
andϵkwere estimated from second-order perturbation theory, and a Runge-Kutta method
was applied to solve the coupled differential equations of (14).
Figure 4 displays the solution of the density matrix elements as a function of time for the
ladder-type excitation scheme. Panels (a) through (c) display the behavior of the diagonal
elements and the approach to a steady-state distribution of qubit spin. The final, steady-
state wave function of the system is comprised of a constant admixture of states S= 0,S=
1/2, and S= 1, of approximately 1 /3 probability for each. The real parts of ρ1,2(t),ρ1,3(t),
andρ2,3(t) are shown as a function of time in panels (d) through (f), respectively. Similarly,
imaginary parts of ρ1,2(t),ρ1,3(t), and ρ2,3(t) are shown as a function of time in panels (g)
through (i), respectively. Other off-diagonal density-matrix elements are ρ2,1(t) =ρ1,2(t)∗,
ρ3,1(t) =ρ1,3(t)∗, and ρ3,2(t) =ρ2,3(t)∗.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this study we have proposed a way to define the qubit of a superconducting transmon
by leveraging its proximity to a resonator readout. In this approach the qubit is defined as
a measure of photon entanglement, via the use of the Schwinger oscillator model of angular

momentum. The Schwinger oscillator construct of angular momentum provides a natural
and robust description of a qubit, applicable to a multilevel model of transmon and resonator
energy states. It is not restricted to a spin-1/2 representation, and can be considered a
definition for an emergent property of the combined transmon-resonator system.
The Schwinger construct introduces angular-momentum, atom-like symmetry, corre-
sponding to underlying conservation of total photon number, N, as a basis from which to
construct the combined transmon-resonator wave function, and thereby, the expectation
value of the qubit. This basis provides a convenient starting point from which to study the
error-inducing effects of transmon anharmonicity, surrounding-environment decoherence,
and random stray fields on qubit state. Specifically, in this analysis, we showed that, even
in the presence of weak transmon anharmonicity, selection rules exist for photon state tran-
sitions. In particular, we showed, via Fig. 1(b), that transitions between states that change
16S=N/2 by a half-integer, or equivalently, change Nby an odd number, are forbidden. This
implies, for example, that the superconducting transmon tends to be robust against random
one-half noise events because such events represent forbidden one-photon transitions. As
transom anharmonicity increases, and the effects of symmetry breaking become stronger,
these forbidden transitions become less strict.

1Abstract
Supplemental details are provided regarding a study of the Schwinger oscillator model of angular
momentum, applied to the superconducting transmon and its resonator readout. In these notes, we
discuss the transmon/resonator Hamiltonian, the Schwinger oscillator model of angular momentum
applied to a definition of the qubit, and the two-state Rabi resonance of this qubit in the steady
state.
I. INTRODUCTION
This supplement presents several derivations associated with the application of the
Schwinger oscillator model of angular momentum [1] to the definition of a superconducting
transmon qubit. The transmon is coupled to a resonator and driven by an external voltage.
Specifically, we discuss the transmon/resonator Hamiltonian, the Schwinger oscillator model
of angular momentum within the scope of the qubit definition, and an approximation of
a two-state Rabi resonance of this qubit in the steady state. In the Rabi resonance ap-
proximation, we calculate the frequency response and coherence time of the qubit using a
Lindblad master equation, which models the immersion of both the transmon and resonator
within the surrounding environment.
II. THE MODEL OF THE TRANSMON AND RESONATOR READOUT
In this study we consider a superconducting transmon of charging energy EC, Josephson
energy EJ, and flux quantum, Φ o=ℏ/2e, that can be modeled as an anharmoinc oscillator.
The periodic energy of flux is given by −EJcosφ−, where we have defined φ−=ϕJ/Φo,
with ϕJa Josephson phase. We count the quanta of charge, q−, byn−=−q−/2e, which
is the number of Cooper pairs that cross the junction. Accounting for a charge offset, via
number ng, with origin in a capacitively coupled gate electrode and/or other influences, we
have a Hamiltonian that can be expressed as
H−= 4EC(n−−ng)2−EJcosφ−. (1)
∗Electronic address: Robert.Erickson2@wellsfargo.com
2For the superconducting transmon, with weak anharmonicity, we can approximate the
flux via a Taylor expansion of the cosine to fourth-order in φ−. Also, assuming the potential
well is deep about φ−= 0, so photons of lowest-lying states are most probable there, we can
eliminate the ngterm of (1) via a suitable transformation [2]. The end result is a Duffing
approximation given by
H−∼=4ECn2

2EJφ2

24EJφ4

where we have shifted the Hamiltonian to remove constant terms that have no bearing on
dynamics.
We also consider a transmission line for readout, modeled as a linear resonator, where
the self inductance and capacitance are defined as LandC, respectively. Here, the equiv-
alent LC-circuit charge and phase are denoted by q+andφ+, respectively, such that the
Hamiltonian is
H+=1
2Lφ2
++1
2Cq2
+. (3)
We assume the transmission line is capacitively coupled to the transmon, which introduces
an interaction term of the form
H+,−=β q+n−, (4)
where βis a proportionality constant. If the full Hamiltonian is defined as Ho=H++H−+
H+,−then we have
Ho=1
2Lφ2

++ 4ECn2
−+1
2EJφ2

−+β q+n−. (5)
As a last step, we allow the system of Hoto be driven by an external voltage, introducing
a time-dependent term, acting on the transmission line, that takes the form
U(t) =−q+V(t), (6)
where V(t) is an effective driving voltage. Thus, the complete open-system Hamiltonian
may be expressed as
H(t) =Ho+U(t). (7)
The Hamiltonian of (7) is quantized by allowing conjugate pairs φ+,q+andn−,φ−to
denote quantum operators, where [ q+, φ+] =iℏand [ φ−, n−] =i. These can be further
second-quantized by defining

III. THE CANONICAL FORM OF THE HAMILTONIAN
As shown in Appendix A, it is useful to affect a canonical transformation on the quadratic
terms of Ho, rendering them diagonal in a new space of decoupled oscillators, denoted by
σ=↑andσ=↓. Via (A6), the fundamental frequencies of these canonical oscillators can be
expressed succinctly as

where σ=↑(σ=↓) has the algebraic meaning of integer +1 ( −1) within the square brackets.
In this transformed space, new annihilation and creation operators aσanda
σact on the
energy levels of the canonical oscillators and satisfy commutation relations like those of aµ

IV. THE SCHWINGER OSCILLATOR MODEL OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM
With canonical transformation applied to the Hamiltonian, we now introduce a metric
to describe entanglement of photons within the combined transmon and resonator system.
Specifically, following the method of Schwinger [1], we use the one-particle canonical ladder
operators to define corresponding two-particle angular momentum operators

which describe a pseudo spin S=Sxˆx+Syˆy+Szˆzof length S, where ˆ x, ˆy, and ˆ zare
unit vectors of an abstract Cartesian coordinate system. The pseudo spin Sis defined
dimensionless since it is not a physical representation of angular momentum. The quantum
number Sis related to the total photon number Nby the expressions
S=N/2, N =n↑+n↓, n σ=a
σaσ. (24)
5An excellent description of the Schwinger oscillator model of angular momentum can be
found in the text of J. J. Sakurai [4].
The spin components Sx,Sy, and Szsatisfy the usual commutation relations of angular
momentum, i.e., [ Sj, Sk] =iϵj,k,lSl, where j, k, l∈ {x, y, z}andϵj,k,lis a Levi-Civita co-
efficient, via the commutation relations of the canonical ladder operators. While we have
introduced the pseudo-spin components via aσanda
σ, we can also write these components
in terms of the original aµanda
µby substituting the inverse canonical transformation of
(16) into (22) and (23). The Schwinger spin is well defined in either original or canonical
space since the spin commutation relations are preserved.
In the linear limit of (19), energy eigenstates are two-particle states of the form |n↑⟩⊗|n↓⟩,
where aσ|nσ⟩=√nσ|nσ−1⟩anda
σ|nσ⟩=√nσ+ 1|nσ+ 1⟩, with eigenvalues En↑,n↓=

σℏωσ(nσ+ 1/2). In this limit, angular momentum states are identical to two-particle
energy eigenstates, but with reordered indexing, such that an angular momentum state is
of the form
|S, m S⟩=a
↑S+mS|0⟩ ⊗a
↓S−mS|0⟩/radicalbig
(S+mS)! (S−mS)!, (25)
where |0,0⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩is the vacuum state, length S= (n↑+n↓)/2 = 0 ,1/2,1, . . ., and
quantum number mS= (n↑−n↓)/2 =−S,−S+ 1, . . . , S −1, S. The state |S, m S⟩is an
eigenstate of the linear Hamiltonian, with eigenvalue ℏξS,mS, where
ξS,mS= (ω↑+ω↓)/parenleftbigg
S+1
2/parenrightbigg
+ (ω↑−ω↓)mS. (26)
Also, since operators S±of (22) are legitimate angular momentum operators, we have the
identities
S±|S, m S⟩=/radicalbig
(S∓mS) (S±mS+ 1)|S, m S±1⟩, (27)
as the reader can verify.
The states |S, m S⟩of (25) are symmetric since the particles of the combined oscillators
are bosons. It is useful to express the Hamiltonian of (19) in this representation, i.e., given
the eigenproblem
Ho|ψk⟩=ℏϵk|ψk⟩, (28)
we can write
/summationdisplay
S′,m′
S⟨S, m S|Ho|S′, m′
S⟩⟨S′, m′
S|ψk⟩=ℏϵk⟨S, m S|ψk⟩;k= 0,1,2, . . . (29)
6In the case EC≪ω↑, ω↓in (19), the set of energies ℏϵkis only slightly perturbed from
that of ℏξS,mS, indicative of minor angular-momentum symmetry breaking, allowing ϵkand
⟨S, m S|ψk⟩to be estimated using standard Rayleigh-Schr¨ odinger time-independent pertur-
bation theory [5].
V. THE SCHWINGER QUBIT NEAR A RABI RESONANCE
We model the immersion of the transmon and resonator in the surrounding environment
via a Lindblad master equation [6], where γ′
µandγµare diffusion and dissipation rates,
respectively, between environment and resonator ( µ= +), and environment and transmon
(µ=−). In this model we assume |˜g| ≪4ωµsuch that, to first approximation, we can neglect
diffusion and dissipation directly between transmon and resonator. Under the canonical
transformation of (16) and (17), the Lindblad master equation can be expressed as

To solve (30), we write it in component form as a set of coupled differential equations in
matrix elements ρk,k′(t) =⟨ψk|ρ(t)|ψk′⟩, where we also define Θ k,k′=⟨ψk|Θ|ψk′⟩, for Θ of
(21), and Ak,k′(σ, s) =⟨ψk|Aσ,s|ψk′⟩, for jump operator Aσ,s. We assume a subset of states,
denoted by E, couple strongly to the applied voltage V(t) near a Rabi resonance, such that,
to good approximation, we effectively can set ρk,k′(t) = 0 unless k, k′∈E. In this way, we
arrive at a practical expression of the Lindblad master equation given by

with ρk′,k(t) determined from (32). In what follows, we consider a single-tone voltage V(t) =
Vosin Ωt, of frequency Ω and amplitude Vo, that excites the transmon-resonator system into
a Rabi resonance, between the ground state and the lowest-lying spin-1/2 state. We derive
an approximate solution for ρk′,k(t) in the steady state, i.e., as t→ ∞ , and we apply this
solution to an estimate of ⟨S(t)⟩, via (34).
A. The Approximate Two-State Density Matrix
We show how to obtain an approximate solution of (32), where E={1,2}, ast→ ∞ . The
two states |ψ1⟩and|ψ2⟩correspond to energy eigenstates ℏϵ1andℏϵ2, respectively, where
we define ϵ2,1=ϵ2−ϵ1>0. We assume a near-resonance condition such that Ω ≈ϵ2,1. The

where we note that ρ1,1(t) = 1−ρ2,2(t) via conservation of probability. In this approximation
we estimate coefficients Θ k,k′and Λ(l,l′)
k,k′using |ψ1⟩∼=|0,0⟩and|ψ2⟩∼=|1/2,−1/2⟩, with
ϵ1∼=ξ0,0andϵ2∼=ξ1/2,−1/2.
A rotating-wave approximation [7] can be applied to the above coupled equations, but
a more general approach, applicable when there are multiple Rabi resonances, is used here,
8one that assumes a solution in the form of a Fourier-like expansion in harmonics of Ω [8].
Ast→ ∞ , corresponding to the steady state, the Fourier-like coefficients can be considered
time independent, such that the solution takes the form
ρ1,2(t) =/summationdisplay
nρ(n)
1,2einΩt, ρ 2,1(t) =/summationdisplay
nρ(n)

Note that our solution will not incorporate the boundary condition at t= 0 since (38) is
only applicable for t≫0. Substituting (38) into (35) through (37), and equating terms of
the same harmonic in Ω, we arrive at

Again, these expressions only apply for t≫0; they determine the final distribution of states
created by the Rabi resonance, which is are primary interest.
Since Ω ≈ϵ2,1, resonance is with the principal harmonic of the applied voltage, so we
expect coefficients of n=±1 to be most significant in the above equations, with coefficients
of|n|>1 small enough in magnitude to be neglected in the first approximation. For
example, using this assumption we can rearrange (41) to obtain

Thus, we have an approximate solution of the relevant diagonal density matrix elements
given a solution of their off-diagonal counterparts. Also, note that these equations imply

For the case n= 0, if we substitute (44) into (39) and (40) we find two homogeneous
coupled algebraic equations in coefficients ρ(0)
1,2andρ(0)
2,1, which requires us to conclude that
ρ(0)
1,2=ρ(0)
2,1= 0. Thus, via (43), we also have ρ(±1)
2,2= 0.
9We are left to solve for the remaining coefficients, ρ(±1)
1,2andρ(±1)
1,2. To obtain these
solutions, we set n=±1 in (39) and (40), and replace ρ(0)
2,2with the expression on the right
side of (42). This gives the preliminary set of four coupled algebraic equations

C. The Half-Width At Half Maximum and Corresponding Decoherence Time
A last step is to simplify the frequency roots, Ω ±of (62), consistent with our earlier
approximations. Specifically, we can write (62) in terms of real and imaginary parts as
Ω±∼=˜ϵ2,1±i∆2,1, (71)
where the energy difference ℏϵ2,1is shifted to a value of ℏ˜ϵ2,1by virtue of the applied voltage,
with

Note that the argument of the square root of ∆ 2,1can change sign with increasing Vo,
which occurs at a critical voltage given by

This voltage is typically of the order of Vc≈1µV, so for voltages of interest, say 10 nV or
less, we have Vo≪Vc. Also for voltages of interest, we have |θ1,2|Vo/ϵ2,1≈10−4, such that
14this contribution to the fourth power in the square root expression of ∆ 2,1can be neglected
to good approximation. This simplifies ∆ 2,1to

the equations of motion of the quadratic limit in a matrix-element form as

where indices µ, ν=±andm, m′=±, and the 4 ×4 dynamical matrix, D, has elements
defined as
Dµ,m;µ,m′=mℏωµδm,m′, (A3)
D−,m;+,m′=1
4iℏ˜g,D+,m;−,m′=−mm′D−,m;+,m′. (A4)
In the above, where indices m, m′=±appear algebraically, they represent integers ±1,
respectively.
Assuming a time evolution of ladder operators of the form Aµ,m(t) =Aµ,mexp (−iωt) we
can construct the eigenproblem as
/summationdisplay
ν,m′Dµ,m;ν,m′Aν,m′=ℏω A µ,m. (A5)
Diagonalizing D, whereby we introduce a new index σ∈ {↑,↓}, we obtain four eigenvalues
forωthat can be expressed as ±ω↑and±ω↓. With the algebraic meaning σ= +1 ( σ=−1)
when index σ=↑(σ=↓), we can write ω↑andω↓succinctly as

Since dynamical matrix Dis non-Hermitian, similarity transformation Sis formed from
columns of right eigenvectors, e, while its inverse, S−1, is formed from rows of left eigenvec-
tors, u. Respectively, introducing index s=±, we can define elements of the right and left
eigenvectors as
eσ,s(µ, m) =1
2ξσ,µ/parenleftbiggωµ+ms ω σ
ωσ/parenrightbigg
eiπ[σm(1−µ)−s(1−σ)]/4, u σ,s(µ, m) =ms e σ,s(µ, m)∗,(A7)

with the meaning ¯ µ=−µand ¯σ=↓(¯σ=↑) when σ=↑(σ=↓). Also, similar to m=±,
the algebraic meaning of s= + ( s=−) is +1 ( −1).
16Due to the form of D, the right and left eigenvectors satisfy the relations
eσ,−s(µ,−m) =eσ,s(µ, m)∗, u σ,−s(µ,−m) =uσ,s(µ, m)∗, (A9)
in addition to the definitions of completeness and orthonormality, viz.

µ,muσ,s(µ, m)eσ′,s′(µ, m) =δσ,σ′δs,s′. (A10)
In the canonical space we can define new ladder operators aσanda
σ, which satisfy the
usual commutation relations. These can be expressed in jump-operator form by defining
Aσ,+=aσandAσ,−=a
σ, analogous to our previous definitions of Aµ,+=aµandAµ,−=a
µ.
Using the right and left eigenvectors, we then have

A consequence of the underlying Lie algebra of the ladder operators of second quantization
is that, while S−1DSrenders the dynamical matrix diagonal, the operations SH(0)

multaneously render the quadratic Hamiltonian diagonal [9]. We leave to the reader the

[3] Note that the nonlinear terms in (19) appear asymmetrical. This is a consequence of the
convention of choosing the conjugate variables for the two oscillators, i.e., readout electric
current is a momentum conjugate variable while the transmon phase, proportional to electric
current, is a position conjugate variable. Again, this is a matter of convention, and has no
effect on the underlying physics.

[9] The similarity transformation Sis sometimes mistakenly referred to as a Bogoljubov trans-
formation. The Bogoljubov transformation refers specifically to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
encountered in reciprocal space. In this case, the reciprocal-space non-Hermitian dynamical
matrix is diagonalized via a similarity transformation that incorporates superpositions of an-
nihilation and creation operators associated with particles propagating in opposite directions.
This was the observation of Bogoljubov [10].
