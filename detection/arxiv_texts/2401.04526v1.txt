Qualitative meta-analysis ABSTRACT  
This study ventures into the dynamic realm of ecosystem orchestration for industrial firms, emphasizing its 
significance in maintaining competitive advantage in the digital era. The fragmented research on this important 
subject poses challenges for firms aiming to navigate and capitalize on ecosystem orchestration. To bridge this 
knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive qualitative meta-analysis of 31 case studies and identified 
multifaceted orchestration practices employed by industrial firms. The core contribution of this research is the 
illumination of five interdependent but interrelated orchestration practices: strategic design, relational, resource 
integration, technological, and innovation. Together, these practices are synthesized into an integrative frame -
work termed the “Stirring Model, ” which serves as a practical guide to the orchestration practices. Furthermore, 
the conceptual framework clarifies the synergy between the identified practices and highlights their collective 
impact. This study proposes theoretical and practical implications for ecosystem orchestration literature and 
suggests avenues for further research.   
1.Introduction 
Over the past two decades, theoretical studies of ecosystems have 
become increasingly prevalent and valuable in strategic management 
research (Altman et al., 2022; Jacobides et al., 2018; Jacobides et al., 
2024 ). Firms manage external environment dependencies through net-
works established by formal bi-lateral inter-organizational relation -
ships, which are strategically significant (Shipilov & Gawer, 2020 ). 
Ecosystems, on the other hand, comprise a set of actors with varying 
degrees of multi-lateral, non-generic complementarities that are not 
fully hierarchically controlled (Jacobides et al., 2018 ). Therefore, eco-
systems are characterized by greater openness, wider heterogeneity of 
partners, and ecosystem-level outputs that create value for the final 
consumer (Kapoor, 2018 ). Orchestration has emerged in both literature 
streams as a necessary management approach facilitating activities 
within such loosely coupled systems, networks (Dhanaraj & Parkhe, 
2006; Giudici et al., 2018 ), and ecosystems (Autio, 2022; Sjodin et al., 
2022 ). However, the hierarchically independent yet technologically and 
economically interdependent nature of multilateral ecosystem partners 
and the focal ecosystem value proposition make ecosystem orchestration a distinct strategic management concept (Autio, 2022; Thomas & Autio, 
2020 ). Ecosystem orchestration involves deliberate, purposeful actions 
usually taken by a hub firm, a keystone player, or an orchestrator 
(Dhanaraj & Parkhe, 2006; Iansiti & Levien, 2004; Iyer et al., 2006 ). The 
literature argues that an ecosystem orchestrator “may play an indis-
pensable role in supporting the ongoing recombination of members ’ 
knowledge to explore new opportunities ” (Giudici et al., 2018 ). 
Although the role of ecosystem orchestrator is perceived as offering 
significant prospects for value capture within the ecosystem (Rietveld 
et al., 2020 ), the objective of orchestration is to create and appropriate 
value among all partners in the ecosystem (Altman et al., 2022; Datt˘ee 
et al., 2018; Majchrzak et al., 2023 ). 
The ecosystem orchestrator requires non-contractual orchestration 
practices (Autio, 2022 ). These practices are imperative for fostering 
voluntary, proactive co-creation among ecosystem partners (Autio, 
2022 ). For instance, Reypens et al. (2021) identified three fundamental 
orchestration practices - connecting, facilitating, and governing - used 
by orchestrators to mobilize diverse ecosystem partners. Nevertheless, 
given the multifaceted nature of ecosystem orchestration, the existing 
research body remains comparatively segmented. First, orchestration

2pertains to various phases of ecosystem evolution, encompassing the 
spectrum from emergence (Daymond et al., 2022; Pushpananthan & 
Elmquist, 2022; Thomas et al., 2022; Gomes, Facin, et al., 2022 ) through 
expansion or momentum to the control phase (Autio, 2022; Holgersson 
et al., 2022; Kolagar et al., 2022 ). The notion of the orchestrating actor 
introduces additional complexity, as different ecosystem stages may 
require varied orchestrators, especially highlighted in the industrial firm 
context (Lingens, Mieh ˘e, et al., 2021 ). For example, an ecosystem 
orchestrator may facilitate the emergence phase with specific enabling 
practices (Blackburn et al., 2022 ), while specialized orchestrators might 
be better equipped for subsequent phases, like commercializing the 
ecosystem ’s value proposition (Lingens, Seeholzer, et al., 2022 ). Second, 
orchestration can manifest in two forms: dominating orchestration, 
where orchestrators assume a visionary and directive role to shape 
ecosystem trajectories and interactions actively, and consensus-based 
orchestration, where orchestrators create a trust-based, adaptable 
environment allowing collaborative dynamics to steer ecosystem evo-
lution organically (Reypens et al., 2021 ). The dominating approach for 
industrial firms tends to align with top-down practices, characterized by 
orchestrators imposing a preconceived structure and direction on the 
ecosystem. Conversely, the consensus-based approach correlates with 
bottom-up practices, where the ecosystem ’s value proposition evolves 
organically without being predefined (Autio, 2022 ). Finally, orchestra -
tion spans various domains, including architecture, community, gover -
nance (Thomas & Tee, 2022 ), and behavioral (Ritala et al., 2023 ), 
necessitating multifaceted practices for effective ecosystem growth 
management. Therefore, a comprehensive examination of orchestration 
practices is essential. Such exploration will provide insights into 
ecosystem orchestrators ’ practices to create and capture value within 
ecosystems, aiming to fulfill a collective vision (Jacobides et al., 2024 ). 
Understanding these practices and their dynamics is crucial for any 
ecosystem orchestrator aspiring to navigate and succeed with ecosys -
tems in the industrial context. 
In line with the above-stated research gaps, the purpose of this is 
twofold. First, identify and synthesize ecosystem practices for industrial 
firms, and second, develop propositions and research agenda for stim-
ulating future research on ecosystem orchestration practices. We con-
ducted a qualitative meta-analysis to consolidate existing research 
results on ecosystem orchestration for industrial firms. Our analysis 
draws insights from 31 case studies published before December 2022, 
revealing the critical role of five distinct ecosystem orchestration prac-
tices: strategic design, relational, resource integration, technological 
leveraging, and innovation practices. These practices encompass 15 key 
orchestration activities and 30 sub-activities, culminating in the devel -
oping of an integrated framework named the “Stirring Model ”. This 
study pioneers the application of qualitative meta-analysis in the field of 
ecosystem orchestration. By integrating perspectives from multiple in-
dustries, our research presents a comprehensive framework for 
ecosystem orchestration practices with high external validity, serving as 
a guidebook and assessment tool for ecosystem orchestrators and 
partners. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 elaborates on 
the theoretical background and reviews relevant literature. Section 3 
covers research methodology, data sources, and analysis. The subse -
quent section introduces a multilayered perspective to ecosystem 
orchestration practices, develops our framework, and formulates eight 
propositions. Section 5 discusses theoretical contributions, managerial 
implications, limitations, and future directions. 
2 Theoretical background 
2.1. Understanding ecosystem concept 
In recent decades, the term “ecosystem ” has gained prominence in 
both research and practice (Adner, 2017; Altman et al., 2022; Jacobides 
et al., 2018 ). This concept offers a novel perspective on organizational collective action and understanding of the competitive environment 
(Thomas & Ritala, 2022 ). These advancements highlight a growing in-
terest in exploring interdependencies across organizations (Adner, 
2017 ) and in the formation of meta-organizations (Gulati et al., 2012; 
Kretschmer et al., 2022 ). Owing to the dispersed nature of co-specialized 
knowledge and the network effects from technological platforms 
(Gawer, 2021; Kretschmer et al., 2022 ), firms increasingly find them -
selves limited to creating and capturing value within their boundaries 
(Ritala & Jovanovic, 2023 ). The nature of co-specialized knowledge and 
its complementary effects have rendered traditional markets inefficient 
(Foss et al., 2023 ), necessitating structures for co-creation and co- 
production practices within the ecosystem domain (Ceccagnoli et al., 
2012 ). Consequently, firms are compelled to engage in collaborations 
within ecosystems (Jacobides et al., 2024 ). 
The origins of ecosystem research can be traced back to Moore 
(1993) , who initially presented the ecosystem construct as a metaphor 
borrowed from biology. In recent years, the term “ecosystem ” has 
evolved to encompass a variety of meanings. Adner (2017) categorized 
these interpretations into two perspectives: (a) ecosystem-as-affiliation, 
which considers ecosystems as communities of associated actors defined 
by their networks and platform affiliations, and (b) ecosystem-as- 
structure, which views ecosystems as configurations of activity defined 
by a value proposition. Recently, there has been emerging consensus on 
the notion of an ecosystem as a structure of interdependence ( Lingens, 
Mieh ˘e, et al., 2021; Gomes, dos Santos, et al., 2022; Gomes, Facin, et al., 
2022 ). Aligning with this prevailing perspective, we adopt the definition 
of an ecosystem as “an alignment structure of interdependent but hier-
archically independent heterogeneous partners collectively striving to 
materialize a shared value proposition ” (Adner, 2017; Autio, 2022; 
Thomas & Ritala, 2022 ). This definition underscores the shared value 
proposition as the cornerstone of collaborative arrangements, incentiv -
izing actors to collaborate and invest in co-specialized assets and ac-
tivities for joint value creation (Jacobides et al., 2024 ). It also plays a 
crucial role in shaping ecosystem boundaries (Adner, 2017; Thomas & 
Ritala, 2022 ). Moreover, the autonomy of ecosystem partners necessi -
tates seeking non-hierarchical ways to orchestrate ecosystems (Autio, 
2022 ). For instance, the alignment structure may also involve mutual 
agreements on standards for interoperability and respective business 
models within the integrated bundle of the shared value proposition 
(Kapoor, 2018; Kohtam aki et al., 2019; Wareham et al., 2014 ). 
Furthermore, based on the functions performed by ecosystem partners, 
the ecosystem aligns with firms whose modules are mutually comple -
mentary and unique, indicating a state of interdependence where firms 
add value to each other and are not easily substitutable (Jacobides et al., 
2018; Lingens, Boger, et al., 2021 ). Essentially, ecosystems cannot be 
reduced to bi-lateral relationships (Adner, 2017; Jacobides et al., 2018 ). 
Ecosystem partners collectively deliver outputs that surpass what any 
single firm could achieve in isolation (Adner, 2017; Lingens, Mieh ˘e, 
et al., 2021; Thomas & Ritala, 2022 ). L. Shen et al.

32.2. Ecosystem orchestration practices and activities 
Orchestration1 is defined as “a set of deliberate, purposeful actions ” 
taken by an orchestrator (Dhanaraj & Parkhe, 2006 ) aimed at unlocking 
the potential and coordinating the efforts of other firms while fostering a 
common vision through organizational and social norms (Carida et al., 
2022 ). This term has become prominent in strategic management and 
marketing literatures, especially when describing the actions of a focal 
firm that facilitate value-creation interactions among various actors, 
moving beyond the traditional supplier-customer relationship (Mann 
et al., 2022; Shi & Shen, 2022 ). Its empowering nature has secured 
orchestration a central position in ecosystem literature (Autio, 2022; 
Lingens, Boger, et al., 2021 ). In the context of an industrial 5G 
ecosystem, effective orchestration involves the collaboration of tele-
communications companies, hardware manufacturers, software de-
velopers, industrial enterprises, regulatory bodies, cybersecurity 
experts, research institutions, logistics partners, and consulting services, 
each playing a distinct yet interconnected role in implementing and 
optimizing 5G technology in smart manufacturing environments. 
Consequently, orchestration has emerged as a dominant theme in the 
industrial ecosystem literature (Pattinson et al., 2022 ), attracting sig-
nificant attention from both academic and business communities. 
Drawing on existing insights, we aim to distinguish and synthesize 
two general perspectives: (a) ecosystem orchestration-as-ability and (b) 
ecosystem orchestration-as-activities. Orchestration-as-ability concep -
tualizes ecosystem orchestration as a combination of capabilities that 
enable and drive ecosystem development. Pitelis and Teece (2018) 
argue that orchestration theory is grounded in and encompasses the 
dynamic capabilities framework. For instance, Schreieck et al. (2021) 
view ecosystem orchestration as a relationship-driven capability that 
assists the orchestrator in enabling and balancing value co-creation and 
capture within an emergent ecosystem. Foss et al. (2023) emphasize 
ecosystem leadership that is facilitating the formation of a shared vision 
(sensing), inducing others to make ecosystem-specific investments 
(seizing), and engaging in ad-hoc problem solving to create and main -
tain stability (reconfiguring/transforming). In contrast, orchestration- 
as-activities involves a dynamic set of evolving actions by ecosystem 
orchestrators to leverage complementary actors for a joint value prop-
osition (Lingens, Mieh ˘e, et al., 2021 ). Cennamo et al. (2022) define 
ecosystem orchestration as a series of processes that facilitate partner 
activities to enhance the ecosystem ’s value. Nambisan and Sawhney 
(2011) present orchestration processes of managing innovation 
leverage, managing innovation coherence, and managing innovation 
appropriability. Viewing orchestration as either capabilities or activ-
ities, the common focus remains on “what ecosystem orchestrators do”. 
Therefore, we integrate these perspectives to investigate how ecosystem 
orchestrators can effectively manage ecosystems. This integration leads 
to a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem orchestration. 
Operating within ecosystems presents significant challenges due to 
tensions in value creation and capture (Cennamo & Santal ˘o, 2019 ) or 
between cooperation and competition among ecosystem partners (Hannah & Eisenhardt, 2018; Kapoor & Lee, 2013 ). Therefore, ecosys -
tems require a degree of control to ensure alignment towards the com-
mon value proposition (Jacobides et al., 2018; Lingens, Mieh ˘e, et al., 
2021 ). This alignment is facilitated by a central actor known as the 
ecosystem orchestrator, who plays a pivotal role in balancing gen-
erativity and coherence in ecosystem outputs (Thomas & Ritala, 2022 ). 
Therefore, irrespective of the perspective on orchestration, the orches -
trator remains a critical entity in managing and aligning the activities of 
the various actors within the ecosystem (B. Lingens, Huber, et al., 2022; 
Lingens, Mieh ˘e, et al., 2021 ). 
2.3. Ecosystem orchestrators 
An ecosystem orchestrator, often referred to as the hub or leader firm 
in ecosystems (Dhanaraj & Parkhe, 2006 ), leverages the benefits of a 
central position, sometimes termed as “smart power ” (Williamson & De 
Meyer, 2012 ). This role enables orchestrators to act as brokers, influ-
encing, mediating, or modifying relationships within the ecosystem 
(Halevy et al., 2019; Ritala et al., 2023 ). Therefore, the presence of an 
ecosystem orchestrator is a fundamental and prominent feature in an 
ecosystem (Linde et al., 2021; Sjodin et al., 2022 ). Notably, ecosystems 
with at least one orchestrator firm practicing effective orchestration 
tend to incur lower transaction costs compared to those without such 
leadership (Foss et al., 2023 ). Orchestrators are indispensable in align -
ing ecosystem partners towards a shared value proposition (Adner, 
2017 ). They aim to steer the ecosystem toward unique value proposi -
tions that are difficult to replicate and imitate, relying on innovative 
business models, opportunity sharing, and the purposeful cultivation of 
long-term partnerships (Ritala et al., 2013 ). 
However, not every company is capable of performing as an 
ecosystem orchestrator (Parida et al., 2019 ). The roles played by 
ecosystem orchestrators can be divided into market designers and 
market explorers (Isckia et al., 2020 ). As market designers, they act as 
architects of the emerging ecosystem, typically defining complemen -
tarity (Lingens, Seeholzer, et al., 2022 ). Orchestrators set system-level 
goals, define hierarchical distinctions among member roles, and estab -
lish standards and interfaces (Holgersson et al., 2022; Sjodin et al., 
2022 ). Ecosystem development is driven by a partially structured pro-
cess led by the orchestrator (Lingens, Seeholzer, et al., 2022 ). Addi-
tionally, orchestrators need to transition from an inward (“ego-centric ”) 
to an outward (“eco-centric ”) mindset (Mann et al., 2022; Shi et al., 
2023 ) and strive to prolong their orchestration role (Leten et al., 2013 ). 
As market explorers, orchestrators function as environmental scanners 
to identify, evaluate, and capitalize on new business opportunities 
(Addo, 2022; Giudici et al., 2018 ). They actively seek new value creation 
opportunities (Kindermann et al., 2022 ), respond to business challenges 
(Reypens et al., 2021 ), alleviate ecosystem bottlenecks (Masucci et al., 
2020 ), and continuously adapt to internal and external dynamic changes 
(Mann et al., 2022 ). 
Ecosystem orchestration presents numerous challenges for orches -
trators, predominantly in resource and relationship management. Or-
chestrators must possess valuable resources, such as unique technology 
(Gawer & Cusumano, 2014 ), provide a stable set of common assets 
(Parida et al., 2019 ), and align internal and external resources to create 
new market opportunities (Isckia et al., 2020; Mann et al., 2022; Zeng 
et al., 2021 ). They are responsible for orchestrating the flow of resources 
(Linde et al., 2021 ). Regarding relationships, these in the ecosystem 
extend beyond traditional commercial alliances, and their harmony 
heavily depends on intangible factors not outlined in formal agreements. 
Orchestrators need to manage relatively autonomous actors (Ge & Liu, 
2022 ) and address the complexities of dealing simultaneously and 
temporally with a large and diverse number of partners (Reypens et al., 
2021 ). They also have to integrate the reactions of other actors into their 
decision-making processes (Isckia et al., 2020 ). Additionally, the 
ecosystem orchestrator must safeguard not only its internal reconfi -
guring activities but also those of the ecosystem partners (Leten et al., 1 In the study of ecosystems, it is important to distinguish between similar but 
distinct concepts like ecosystem governance, coordination, and orchestration. 
Ecosystem governance refers to a set of regulatory rules, including those for 
value capture, technological standards, and membership, which are designed to 
control the behavior of ecosystem members (Gomes et al., 2021 ). This gover -
nance typically relies on formal, hierarchical one-to-one supplier contracts 
(Autio, 2022 ), as opposed to ecosystem orchestration, which involves engaging 
partners voluntarily (Carida et al., 2022 ) and includes more situationally flex-
ible activities. Ecosystem coordination, on the other hand, deals with breaking 
down, recording, and altering tasks, thereby creating new work formats for the 
coordinating body (Mann et al., 2022 ). Unlike orchestration, which aims to 
unite independent players for mutual benefit and a shared vision, coordination 
is primarily focused on benefiting the entity that coordinates these efforts 
(Mann et al., 2022 ). L. Shen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Journal of Business Research 173 (2024) 114463
42013; Linde et al., 2021 ). This requires providing stability, displaying 
compliance, and ensuring conformity (Autio, 2022 ; Lingens, Huber, 
et al., 2022 ). While orchestrators have traditionally been large, estab -
lished firms, recent research shows that small firms, startups, and even 
marginal firms can assume the role of orchestrators (Cui et al., 2019; 
Lingens, Mieh ˘e, et al., 2021 ). Moreover, the number of orchestrators 
within an ecosystem can vary, leading to single, double, or multiple 
orchestration systems (Lingens, Huber, et al., 2022 ). 
Based on the level of control exerted by orchestrators, ecosystem 
orchestration modes can be classified into three categories: dominating, 
consensus-based, and hybrid orchestration. Dominating orchestration is 
a top-down approach where orchestrators exercise significant control 
and design influence, intentionally shaping the ecosystem ’s architecture 
(Autio, 2022; Reypens et al., 2021 ). In contrast, consensus-based 
orchestration operates on a bottom-up approach, prioritizing ongoing 
collaboration, negotiations, and voluntary engagement (Autio, 2022; 
Reypens et al., 2021 ), emphasizing collective action among different 
ecosystem participants (Thomas & Ritala, 2022 ). The third mode, hybrid 
orchestration, as proposed by Reypens et al. (2021) , involves orches -
trators switching between dominating and consensus-based modes in 
response to ecosystem challenges. We adopt this perspective, recog -
nizing the need for adaptability in different situations. 
The insights discussed here are primarily sourced from a range of 
qualitative studies, emphasizing case study methodologies. However, 
the heterogeneity in research foci, theoretical frameworks, and contexts 
of analysis has led to a lack of systematic organization and integration 
among the findings. Despite this, it is noteworthy that many orchestra -
tion practices demonstrate notable similarities across diverse industries, 
as highlighted by Ritala et al. (2013) . This observation underscores the 
potential for employing qualitative meta-analysis as a method to amal-
gamate and refine these disparate results into a more cohesive under -
standing. Considering the pivotal role of ecosystem orchestrators, this 
study adopts an orchestrator-centric lens. Consequently, the research 
question posited is: What practices do ecosystem orchestrators employ 
to orchestrate their ecosystems effectively? 
3 Research methods 
3.1. Qualitative meta-analysis 
This study employed a qualitative meta-analysis approach to address 
the research questions. This method was first introduced by Hoon in 
2013 as “meta-synthesis of qualitative case studies ” in the field of or-
ganization and management research, where he systematically explored 
its implications and operational steps (Hoon, 2013 ). In line with recent 
studies (e.g., Laubengaier et al. (2022); Küberling-Jost (2021) ), we refer 
to this method as qualitative meta-analysis. It serves as an exploratory 
research design aimed at reinterpreting and synthesizing primary 
qualitative case studies to refine existing theories, extend them and even 
to generate new ones (Habersang et al., 2019 ). The primary objective of 
qualitative meta-analysis is to develop novel theoretical interpretations 
that surpass the findings reported in primary case studies (Combs et al., 
2019 ). Case studies are particularly valuable as they usually explore the 
reasons and nature of events in particular contexts, providing rich and 
unique empirical descriptions that may often not fully captured by 
quantitative studies (Habersang et al., 2019; Rauch et al., 2014 ). How-
ever, due to the emphasis on the novelty in the research findings, 
different conclusions may arise for the same phenomenon (Hoon, 2013 ). 
To address this, the qualitative meta-analysis approach rigorously ana-
lyzes a large number of case studies, which can reconcile previous 
divergent and irreconcilable empirical evidence to provide more robust, 
generalizable, and comprehensive conclusions (Habersang et al., 2019 ). 
This is where qualitative meta-analysis differs greatly from literature 
review and particularly bibliometric study. 
While literature review encompasses both qualitative and quantita -
tive research, qualitative meta-analysis focuses exclusively on literature that employs the case study methodology. Additionally, literature re-
view aims to integrate the findings of prior studies (Berente et al., 2019 ), 
thereby objectively identifying major contributors, topics, and research 
gaps in a field (Mukherjee et al., 2022 ). On the other hand, qualitative 
meta-analysis attempts to synthesize key variables and underlying re-
lationships from published qualitative case studies to build a theory and 
go beyond the contributions in the original studies (Hoon, 2013 ). 
Furthermore, compared with quantitative meta-analysis, which uses 
additive logic to synthesize findings, qualitative meta-analysis interprets 
key qualitative evidence from different contexts to achieve higher 
replicability of theories (Edmondson & McManus, 2007 ). 
The research design of qualitative meta-analysis is particularly suit-
able for our study for the following reasons. Firstly, a crucial insight 
from our literature review is that most research on ecosystem orches -
tration remains qualitative in nature, and case studies make up a large 
proportion of the qualitative research. Secondly, ecosystem orchestra -
tion is complex and ambiguous. Although a range of case studies have 
explored ecosystem orchestration, providing rich, contextualized 
empirical descriptions, the existing results remain relatively isolated and 
lack systematicity. Instead, qualitative meta-analysis facilitates the 
provision of general inferences, achieving a comprehensive under -
standing that transcends the results of individual studies (Rauch et al., 
2014 ). To our knowledge, there is no study in the domain of ecosystem 
orchestration that has tried to employ this method. In conclusion, 
qualitative meta-analysis is most beneficial in moderate or mature 
research areas with unique phenomena and lack of adequate quantita -
tive measures (Edmondson & McManus, 2007 ), which is exactly in line 
with the current state of research in the field of ecosystem orchestration. 
Inspired by previous research in the domain of qualitative meta- 
analysis (Hoon, 2013; Laubengaier et al., 2022 ) and by modifying, 
integrating, and localizing some of the phases according to the condi -
tions of our study, we defined a four-stage process to conduct a quali -
tative meta- analysis. The initial stages encompass a thorough search in 
databases and manual filtering in the data source section, followed by 
careful within-case analysis and cross-case analysis in the data analysis 
section. Each stage will be explained in detail. 
3.2. Data sources 
The first and pivotal step is to identify literature that is closely 
related to our research question. As depicted in Fig. 1, we conducted a 
comprehensive search in databases to locate relevant research materials. 
Subsequently, we established rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria 
during the manual filtering stage. The literature was filtered progres -
sively by subject area, document type, document language, research 
method, and research theme. 
3.2.1. Stage one: Search in databases 
This study undertook a rigorous literature retrieval process to gather 
relevant articles on ecosystem orchestration from both Web of Science 
(WoS) Core Collection and Scopus databases. To ensure high-quality 
papers, we focused on editions of Science Citation Index Expanded 
and Social Science Citation Index within WoS. The search term 
“ecosystem orchestrat* ” was utilized, covering variations of “ecosystem 
orchestration ”, “ecosystem orchestrator ” and “ecosystem orchestrate ”. 
The search was limited to publications up to December 2022. Initially, 
371 publications were retrieved from WoS, and Scopus yielded 850 
publications. The subject area was then narrowed down to business, 
management, and accounting, resulting in 112 papers retained from 
WoS and 202 from Scopus. We filtered the document types to include 
only articles, review articles, and conference papers, eliminating book 
chapters and books. This step left us with 178 papers from Scopus, while 
no exclusions were made in WoS. Furthermore, we only included pub-
lications written in English, and after excluding one paper in French, a 
total of 177 papers from Scopus were retained. Next, we aggregated the 
289 papers from both databases and removed 96 duplicates, resulting in L. Shen et al.

5a final selection of 193 unique papers. These 193 documents form the 
foundation for the subsequent manual filtering stage. 
3.2.2. Stage two: Manual filtering 
The manual filtering stage consists of three main parts: screening 
based on research method, screening based on research topic, and 
literature supplementation. Firstly, the focus of the research method 
filtering was on identifying papers that utilized a case study methodol -
ogy, while excluding quantitative studies, conceptual studies, and 
literature reviews that did not meet the specified research method 
criteria. Initially, 115 articles were found to satisfy the standards based on their titles and abstracts, while 28 articles required further evaluation 
through reading their full texts. After this comprehensive assessment, 14 
articles were deemed to meet the criteria, resulting in 129 qualitative 
case studies being retained. Secondly, in the filtering process for 
research topic, we applied specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to 
ensure that the selected papers aligned with the requirements of the 
research theme. Specifically, we focused on cases within enterprise 
scenarios, excluding cases in smart cities or academic organizations. 
Additionally, we retained essays that focused on ecosystem orchestra -
tors, while excluding papers from other perspectives, such as comple -
mentary companies. Importantly, the selected papers needed to address

Shen et al.

6our study ’s research question. These screenings yielded a set of 29 pa-
pers that met all the established requirements. 
Thirdly, to ensure the completeness of our selection, we further 
utilized Google Scholar to search for any additional papers that met our 
established criteria. This supplementary search contributed to the dis-
covery of two additional papers that satisfied our criteria. Consequently, 
the final selection of papers for our study on ecosystem orchestration 
comprised a total of 31 published case studies (see Table 1) and cover 
111 business cases. This is a reasonable number of studies for in-depth 
analysis and interpretation according to Laubengaier et al. (2022) . It 
also satisfies the optimal data range requirements (12–100) for con-
ducting qualitative meta-analysis, as proposed by Timulak (2009) . 
Moreover, the number of studies is in close proximity to those conducted 
by Berente et al. (2019) (35 studies), Laubengaier et al. (2022) (35 
studies), Küberling-Jost (2021) (20 studies), and Habersang et al. (2019) 
(43 studies). 
In conclusion, we conducted a comprehensive search in the WoS and 
Scopus databases, supplemented the results with Google Scholar, and 
carefully evaluated the selected papers by reading the titles, abstracts, 
and full texts to ensure the inclusion of relevant papers that met our 
predefined requirements. 
3.3. Data analysis 
The data analysis in this study draws from the research of Hoon 
(2013) and Laubengaier et al. (2022) , and it encompasses both within- 
case and cross-case analysis. Within-case analysis involves conducting 
individual content analyses for each case to identify first-order codes. 
These first-order codes are then synthesized during the cross-case 
analysis to form second-order themes, and these themes are further 
aggregated into dimensions. Inspired by the research of Habersang et al. 
(2019) and Küberling-Jost (2021) , our data analysis used abductive 
reasoning, which combines the features of deductive and inductive 
reasoning and facilitates scholars to build theories in the qualitative 
secondary analysis (Vila-Henninger et al., 2022 ). It is important to note 
that qualitative meta-analysis does not rely on reusing the first-hand data 
collected by the original researchers. Instead, it builds upon their in-
terpretations and understanding of the data (Hoon, 2013 ). Moreover, we 
specifically focus on the findings, discussion, and conclusion sections of 
previous case studies to explore novel theoretical insights. 
3.3.1. Within-case analysis 
In the within-case analysis, we used both deductive and inductive 
coding to identify first-order codes. We start by developing a deductive 
coding scheme based on the existing theoretical framework of ecosystem 
orchestration. Resource-based view (Barney, 1991 ), dynamic capability 
(Teece et al., 1997 ) and collective action theory (Olson, 1965 ) are 
generally regarded as important theoretical foundations in the field of 
ecosystem orchestration, so we chose them as the theoretical back-
ground. To create a comprehensive deductive coding system, we then 
analyzed pertinent literature about these three theories, which 
contributed to identify relevant deductive codes (see Table 2). Subse -
quently, the deductive coding scheme was applied as a guidebook to 
further perform deductive coding in 31 papers extracted form data 
source. By using the deductive coding system, we systematically filtered 
the data to find first-order codes that can answer our research question. 
At the same time, inductive coding or open coding (Gioia et al., 2013 ) 
was conducted to explore additional information that was not precon -
ceived, resulting in the generation of inductive codes. In this coding 
process, we focus on the researchers ’ descriptions in the original studies 
about the specific practices or activities of orchestrators in orchestrating 
ecosystem. Besides, we also paid attention to variables that affect 
ecosystem orchestration and those that are affected by ecosystem 
orchestration, as well as those that influence each other, appear 
together, or appear sequentially (Küberling-Jost, 2021; Laubengaier 
et al., 2022 ). This stage generated a total of 377 first-order concepts, Table 1

3.3.2. Cross-case analysis 
In the cross-case analysis, we conducted axial coding to group the 
above first-order concepts into second-order themes and then classify 
dominant themes into different dimensions. Through an iterative pro-
cess of comparing and contrasting codes for similarities and differences, 
we extracted, condensed, and summarized these themes, ultimately 
identifying dominant second-order patterns. Thereafter, we explored 
associations between themes and identified logical relationships among 
them, facilitating the aggregation of interrelated themes into di-
mensions. The whole data analysis process was iterated over and over 
again to find meaningful and logical results. Finally, we identified 5 
dimensions, comprising a total of 15 s-order themes and 30 first-order 
codes. 
To effectively present our findings, we created a data structure (see 
Fig. 2) that illustrates the specific contents and affiliations of first-order 
codes (sub-orchestration activities), second-order themes (key orches -
tration activities), and aggregate dimensions (ecosystem orchestration 
practices). Subsequently, we identified the relationships between these 
aggregate dimensions and developed theoretical frameworks and argu-
ments to address our research questions (Gomes, dos Santos, et al., 
2022 ). Based on these discussions, we propose a complete framework for 
ecosystem orchestration practices (see Fig. 3). 
4.Findings 
In the following section, we present the findings related to our 
research question. Table 3 provides an overview of the findings and their 
illustrative sources. After synthesizing the existing fragmented research, 
we have identified five ecosystem orchestration practices that are car-
ried out by the ecosystem orchestrator based on our data analysis. These 
practices include ecosystem strategic design practices, ecosystem rela-
tional practices, ecosystem resource integration practices, ecosystem 
technological leveraging practices, and ecosystem innovation practices, 
which are further detailed in Fig. 2. 
4.1. Ecosystem strategic design practices 
Ecosystem strategic design practices serve as both a roadmap and a 
strategic blueprint to guide the future development and growth of the 
ecosystem. Our data analysis underscores the pivotal role these practices 
play in ecosystem orchestration. Ecosystem strategic design is dynamic, 
with its optimal configuration varying according to the prevailing 
environmental uncertainty (Lingens, Mieh ˘e, et al., 2021 ). Orchestrators Table 1 (continued )

8proactively engage in designing the value proposition, forming an 
ecosystem identity, and monitoring growth and changes. 
The first key orchestration activity, designing the value proposition , 
involves defining the ecosystem ’s objectives, blueprint, and unique po-
sition vis-ˇa-vis other ecosystems (Panico & Cennamo, 2022 ). The value 
proposition – a central concept in the ecosystem literature – represents 
the ecosystem ’s connectivity pattern and establishes its boundaries 
(Adner, 2017; Linde et al., 2021 ). Orchestrators must make strategic 
decisions in designing an appealing value proposition (Isckia et al., 
2020 ), playing a crucial role in defining a shared vision and translating it 
into a business model (Zucchella & Previtali, 2019 ). On the one hand, 
orchestrators negotiate the value offering with partners, giving due 
consideration to participants ’ motivations and ensuring fair value dis-
tribution. This requires finding, setting, and maintaining the right bal-
ance between the common ecosystem vision and partners ’ self-interest 
to incentivize active participation and contribution (e.g., double value 
proposition) (Isckia et al., 2020; Kamalaldin et al., 2021; Laczko et al., 
2019 ). Joint forums and meetings are effective in achieving this balance 
(Reypens et al., 2021; Ritala et al., 2013 ). This negotiation and inter-
action process not only safeguards ecosystem stability but also aligns 
heterogeneous complementors with the joint value proposition 
(Aagaard & Rezac, 2022; Mann et al., 2022 ), which is beneficial for 
seizing and exploiting business opportunities (Linde et al., 2021 ). On the 
other hand, orchestrators and partners share a common vision of shared 
value , which is central to decision making and is aimed at reaping long- 
term benefits (Ritala et al., 2013 ). Achieving this common vision facil-
itates communication, builds trust, and strengthens commitment and 
engagement among partners (Zucchella & Previtali, 2019 ), ensuring a 
stable and sustainable relationship. Significantly, it shifts the mindset of 
actors from a traditional value chain towards complementary co- 
creation (Aagaard & Rezac, 2022; Jacobides et al., 2018 ). 
In addition to designing the value proposition, our research has un-
covered another crucial facet of ecosystem orchestration: forming an 
ecosystem identity . This is defined as the collective understanding 
among participants on the fundamental, enduring, and distinctive at-
tributes that define an ecosystem ’s value proposition (Thomas & Ritala, 
2022 ). It encompasses elements such as distinctive features, branding, 
and cultural attributes, which serve to define the specific traits of the 
ecosystem. Orchestrators strive to create these unique identity character -
istics, making strategic choices to differentiate the ecosystem from 
competitors and attract aligned participants (Blackburn et al., 2022 ). 
However, building a credible identity can be challenging, often 
requiring assistance from partners who bring in new perspectives and 
expertise (Tabas et al., 2022 ). This identity formation process involves 
legitimizing the identity – in other words, winning the agreement of others. 
Ecosystem legitimacy emerges as a dynamic process where orchestra -
tors, participants, and external actors engage in collective action 
(Thomas & Ritala, 2022 ). It fosters trust and a sense of belonging within 
the ecosystem, enhancing internal and external understanding and 
recognition. Ecosystem identity is intrinsically intertwined with the 
identities of individual participants. In emerging markets, ecosystem 
identity building may leverage the brand of an established ecosystem 
pilot participant as a foundational element (Blackburn et al., 2022 ). 
Finally, the third key orchestration activity is monitoring growth and 
changes , emphasizing the detection of and adaptation to external dy-
namic changes. To effectively orchestrate an ecosystem, orchestrators 
must scan and evaluate market and technological conditions , identifying 
emerging opportunities, mitigating risks, and responding swiftly to Table 2

9changes. For instance, orchestrators continuously gather and iterate 
consumer feedback to meet their needs (Mann et al., 2022 ). These op-
portunities are strategically leveraged by orchestrators to drive growth 
and foster innovation. The orchestrator ’s role in ecosystem development 
lies in the ability to continuously explore, assess, and act on emerging 
opportunities to create and deliver value (Laczko et al., 2019 ). Addi-
tionally, orchestrators gain strategic foresight on emerging issues , which 
they use to direct actions towards orchestrating resource pools and spur 
rapid growth (Zeng et al., 2022 ). These monitoring activities involve not 
only a general assessment of the business landscape but also careful 
scrutiny of potential opportunities for targeted initiatives concerning 
specific objectives and customers (Kamalaldin et al., 2021 ). 
The above-mentioned discussion leads to our first proposition: 
Proposition 1.In orchestrating ecosystems, orchestrators initiate 
comprehensive ecosystem strategic design practices, including designing the 
value proposition, forming an ecosystem identity, and monitoring growth and 
changes. These activities act as facilitators of value creation, identifying the specific value to be created and directing other orchestrated actions 
accordingly. 
4.2. Ecosystem relational practices 
Our study reveals that ecosystem orchestrators engage in what we 
label as ecosystem relational practices, comprising three vital factors 
that are detailed subsequently. Ecosystems consist of relationships that 
transcend collections of bilateral interactions (Adner, 2017 ). Ecosystem 
partners, acting as complementors, provide crucial assistance to or-
chestrators in securing financial, human, and technical resources, 
bridging technological gaps, and adapting to rapid changes (Kolagar 
et al., 2022 ). When partners share aligned interests and promote altru-
istic behavior, value creation becomes a joint responsibility of the entire 
network, not solely dependent on orchestrators ’ capabilities and re-
sources (Laczko et al., 2019 ). Hence, managing relationships is a pivotal 
aspect of ecosystem orchestration.

10The first key activity, mapping and integrating partners , involves 
identifying partners and creating a network that aligns with the eco-
system ’s value proposition. External companies, particularly from other 
industries, add diversity and creativity to the ecosystem (Lu & Zhang, 
2022 ), enhancing its existing value proposition and facilitating entry 
into emerging businesses (Lu & Zhang, 2022; Mieh ˘e et al., 2022 ). Or-
chestrators use various means to attract potential partners for scaling , such 
as leveraging patents and other intellectual property assets to draw in 
new actors, given their inherently proprietary nature (Azzam et al., 
2017 ). As the ecosystem expands, controlling the entry of new partners 
based on risk and benefit analysis becomes crucial (Parida et al., 2019 ). 
Orchestrators clarify the roles, status, and responsibilities of internal 
partners, making their place in the ecosystem explicit (Aagaard & Rezac, 
2022 ). 
Drawing on initial insights and a deeper understanding of partici -
pants, ecosystem orchestrators strive to seek partner complementarity 
to align and secure partners for long-lasting collaboration. Trust and the 
maturity of symbiotic relationships are crucial for thriving ecosystems 
(Ritala et al., 2013 ). In newly established ecosystems where partici -
pating companies are relatively unfamiliar with each other, orchestra -
tors assume the role of matchmakers, facilitating the harmonious 
development of partnerships. They identify complementarities and in-
terdependencies between actors for subsequent collaboration (Zucchella 
& Previtali, 2019 ). These efforts optimize the ecosystem ’s partner layout 
by selecting, positioning, and connecting partners, thereby leveraging 
the complementarities and network effects in the case of platform eco-
systems (Aagaard & Rezac, 2022; Jovanovic, Sjodin, et al., 2022; Zeng 
et al., 2022 ). Building on this initial recognition of actor complemen -
tarities and interdependencies, orchestrators can enhance relational 
interdependence through structural complementarity (Lingens, See-
holzer, et al., 2022 ). Another strategy to promote interdependence fo-
cuses on emotional connection, especially in building trust and fostering 
commitment among actors (Tian et al., 2021 ). Long-term relationships are 
more beneficial for companies (Omer, 2022 ), making the establishment 
of regular routines, such as face-to-face meetings, vital for enhancing 
communication and strengthening partner bonds (Reypens et al., 2021 ). 
These activities encourage and facilitate cooperation among previously 
isolated actors in the ecosystem, thereby retaining partners for its stable 
and sustainable development. Thus, partners can effectively combine and utilize their distinct resources in a complementary fashion (Linde 
et al., 2021 ). 
As the number of heterogeneous actors, transactions, and in-
teractions increases, so does the risk of misalignment in the outcomes 
desired (Carida et al., 2022 ). Consequently, uniting partners around a 
common goal from the top down becomes increasingly challenging 
(Reypens et al., 2021 ). Eventually, the complexity of the situation may 
surpass the orchestrator ’s capacity to manage it alone (Isckia et al., 
2020; Kolagar et al., 2022 ). This scenario introduces another crucial 
function of orchestrators, termed empowering partners . This function 
underscores the importance of providing support and inspiration to 
partners to co-create value. Orchestrators make significant upfront in-
vestments to alleviate partner uncertainty (Parida et al., 2019 ) and 
enhance their risk resilience. Additionally, orchestrators deploy finan -
cial resources to motivate participants, establishing direct financial in-
centives and indirectly spurring motivation by investing in technology 
and other appealing resources (Gomes et al., 2021; Masucci et al., 2020 ). 
It is important to note that ecosystem partners are not merely benefi -
ciaries but also value creators within the ecosystem. Successful 
ecosystem orchestration is attainable only when a company actively 
involves its partners in the process (Sjodin et al., 2022 ). Ecosystem or-
chestrators promote solution co-creation and co-ownership (Sjodin et al., 
2022 ) and even encourage other actors to participate in co-orchestration 
(Reypens et al., 2021 ). Mann et al. (2022) observed that orchestrators 
empower all business ecosystem actors to leverage opportunities for 
developing and testing innovative digital applications. Special attention 
is required for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a critical 
category of actors. Orchestrators play a pivotal role in nurturing and 
supporting the growth of startups and SMEs by endowing these firms with 
credibility and legitimacy (Tabas et al., 2022 ). Moreover, they provide 
essential support to SMEs in their efforts to enter new markets (Lingens, 
Seeholzer, et al., 2022 ). These nurturing actions are instrumental in 
fostering the development of new business opportunities within the 
ecosystem (Parida et al., 2019 ). 
Thus, we propose: 
Proposition 2.In the orchestration of ecosystems, orchestrators are 
required to undertake ecosystem relational practices, including mapping, 
engaging, and integrating partners, seeking partner complementarity, and 
empowering partners. These activities form the basis of ecosystem

Shen et al.

sustainability . 
4.3. Ecosystem resource integrating practices 
Numerous enterprises strategically opt to join an ecosystem pri-
marily to alleviate their resource scarcity. This participation facilitates 
access to crucial resources and reaps the benefits of prospective eco-
nomic advantages associated with resource efficiency (Blackburn et al., 
2022; Kolagar et al., 2022 ). Ecosystem orchestrators, positioned as 
central entities in the ecosystem, are often perceived as resource abun -
dant, possessing control over the most indispensable resources (Cui 
et al., 2019 ). Given the diversity of resources and entangled partner 
resources, it is crucial for orchestrators to dynamically and effectively 
reconfigure these resource bundles (Isckia et al., 2020 ). The third 
identified practice, termed ecosystem resource integrating practices, 
includes optimizing existing resources, acquiring new external re-
sources, and facilitating the mutual use of resources by partners. 
Optimizing resources emphasizes the identification, reorganization, 
and alignment of existing resources to co-create value (Carida et al., 
2022 ). Based on their acquaintance with partners, orchestrators strate -
gically match resources to necessary tasks (Reypens et al., 2021 ). On the 
one hand, they identify and experiment with underutilized resources , such 
as idle assets, to retain resource value (Zeng et al., 2022 ). Particularly in 
situations with limited resources, orchestrators should focus on internal 
idle resources, redeploying them flexibly within their ecosystem to 
address resource dilemmas and foster flexibility capabilities (Cui et al., 
2022 ). On the other hand, orchestrators redeploy previously scattered and 
unconnected resources to expand their resource portfolio, seek break -
throughs, and change the market (Zeng et al., 2021 ). For instance, or-
chestrators merge the dispersed resources of partners to enhance 
resource usage efficiency (Mann et al., 2022 ). Additionally, adopting a 
circular resource strategy, encompassing principles of reuse, reduction, 
recycling, and recovery, is highly effective (Blackburn et al., 2022 ). 
These activities demonstrate that resource optimization is a continuous, 
dynamic process that perpetually seeks optimal value creation. 
The paradigm of resource orchestration is undergoing a significant 
transformation, shifting from traditional management of static internal 
resources to a more holistic, dynamic, and evolving approach that en-
compasses both internal and external resources (Zeng et al., 2021 ). 
Acquiring resources involves efforts by ecosystem orchestrators to assist 
partners in accessing complementary external resources. Orchestrators 
identify any misalignments between existing and required resources and 
subsequently access external resources through ecosystem boundary 
expansion to meet complementors ’ needs (Cui & Han, 2022 ). They can 
purchase resources directly from strategic factor markets or internalize 
external resources through cooperation. In addition, ecosystem orches -
trators can obtain funding from external investors (Lingens, Boger, et al., 
2021 ). Lingens, Boger, et al. (2021) note that, when startups assume the Table 3

12role of an orchestrator, they often require funding from external investors 
to scale up. Furthermore, continuously updating resources in the 
ecosystem is essential to maintain competitiveness and reduce vulner -
ability (Zeng et al., 2021 ). As Zeng et al. (2022) explain, the strategic 
emphasis of these resource-acquiring processes has shifted from pos-
sessing and controlling all valuable resources to attracting, accessing, 
cultivating, and mutually exchanging external resources. Indeed, or-
chestrators should strive to balance temporary external resources with 
enduring internal resources (Poblete et al., 2022 ). 
Sharing resources involves actively promoting openness and the 
sharing of resources to stimulate innovation and value creation (Isckia 
et al., 2020; Teng et al., 2023 ). Knowledge, capital, and other critical 
factors collaborate in a system to create a symbiotic and continuous 
environment (Hu & Zhang, 2023 ). Some resources, previously invalu -
able to one organization, may be useful to others (Burstr om et al., 2021 ). 
From the perspective of partners, their motivation to share resources 
varies. One reason is to access a larger pool of resources by collaborating 
with other ecosystem actors, potentially leading to a “piece of the bigger 
pie” (Kamalaldin et al., 2021 ). Another reason is to safeguard essential 
resources amidst internal and external uncertainties, which may 
necessitate selective or limited collaboration with other players in the 
ecosystem (Kamalaldin et al., 2021 ). In ecosystems, orchestrators are 
responsible for facilitating resource flow, providing tangible and intangible 
resources for actors to pursue value (Lu & Zhang, 2022 ). For instance, 
Leten et al. (2013) assert that ecosystem orchestrators consistently 
invest in intellectual property within their field of expertise and share it 
with partners, stimulating ecosystem progress. Moreover, ecosystem 
orchestrators can offer specific investments to support weaker players in 
the ecosystem (Tabas et al., 2022 ). Ecosystem innovation is triggered by 
sharing and combining diverse intangible and tangible resources among 
organizations (Poblete et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, orchestrators provide 
heterogeneous resources to attract new complementary players and leverage 
business opportunities (Cui et al., 2022 ). The creation and capture of 
value are enhanced when ecosystem participants ’ resources are 
consolidated (Kamalaldin et al., 2021 ). In these activities, the orches -
trator acts as a broker, not aiming to own the resources but to capture a 
portion of the value generated from transactions and exchanges 
(Blackburn et al., 2022 ). 
Thus, we propose: 
Proposition 3.In orchestrating ecosystems, orchestrators are required to 
undertake ecosystem resource integrating practices, including optimizing re-
sources, acquiring resources, and sharing resources. These activities comprise 
the basis of ecosystem orchestration and contribute to ensuring efficient 
resource utilization, value creation, and value capture. 
4.4. Ecosystem technological leveraging practices 
In the context of a flourishing technological revolution, digital 
technology has become the primary arena for innovation, bringing 
about significant developments in business (Chen et al., 2022; Dana 
et al., 2022; Kanski & Pizon, 2023; Shang et al., 2023; Tu et al., 2023 ). 
With the rapid advancement of digital technologies, such as big data 
analytics, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and 
machine learning, digitization has opened up new opportunities for 
ecosystems (Jovanovic, Sjodin, et al., 2022 ). These opportunities facil-
itate exchanging information, building competitiveness, and innovating 
business models (Cui et al., 2021; Kamalaldin et al., 2021; Mieh ˘e et al., 
2022 ). There is a noticeable trend among traditional manufacturers to 
actively seek strategic ecosystem collaboration with digital technology 
and software providers to create digital value (Sjodin et al., 2022 ). These 
technologies are diffused among organizations and are developed 
through inter-organizational cooperation (Burstr om et al., 2021; 
Fredstr om et al., 2021; Tagscherer & Carbon, 2023; Xu et al., 2022 ). For 
example, the deployment of AI is idiosyncratic, requiring collaborative 
efforts from various organizational entities to produce difficult-to- imitate AI applications (Mikalef et al., 2023 ). However, the fragmenta -
tion caused by technological advances often results in participants 
operating in isolated silos, necessitating an orchestrator to efficiently 
oversee and mediate (Leten et al., 2013 ). The fourth identified practice is 
termed ecosystem technological leveraging practices, which refers to 
orchestrators ’ utilization of digital technologies to drive the ecosystem. 
The primary key activity, termed establishing a secure and inter-
connected digital infrastructure , is guided by a business model that 
incorporates constant feedback and performance monitoring (Blackburn 
et al., 2022 ). Orchestrators foster the adoption of digital infrastructure 
through open architecture , enabling the seamless integration of other 
ecosystem partners ’ systems into their digital framework for joint value 
creation (Kamalaldin et al., 2021 ). In this digital architecture, other 
ecosystem actors can connect their digital solutions, identify operational 
inefficiencies, and enhance customer value (Kamalaldin et al., 2021 ). 
Orchestrators can skillfully intertwine technical product and service 
design with the digital systems, enhancing the reconfiguration potential 
in the ecosystem (Hsuan et al., 2021; Jovanovic, Sjodin, et al., 2022 ). 
Furthermore, the technical architecture and algorithmic management of 
the ecosystem play a pivotal role in automatically detecting, reporting, 
and preventing violations of ecosystem rules (Blackburn et al., 2022 ). It 
is crucial to recognize that this activity is not a static endpoint but an 
ongoing and iterative process involving continuous improvement of the 
technical architecture (Mann et al., 2022 ). Additionally, orchestrators 
promote the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) by comple -
mentary partners (Lingens, Boger, et al., 2021; Zeng et al., 2022 ). For 
example, in the e-commerce industry, orchestrators provide partners 
with access to APIs to enhance their transactional capabilities (Isckia 
et al., 2020 ). As highlighted by Marheine et al. (2021) , facilitating 
partner access to devices and developing commercial applications 
through open and interoperable technologies is beneficial. 
Big data is a valuable, rare, irreplaceable, and hard-to-imitate 
resource, especially in the context of digital trading platforms (Zeng 
et al., 2021 ). Ecosystems, with their broad and heterogeneous partici -
pant base potentially spanning the entire value chain and product life 
cycle, provide an opportunity to collect a more extensive set of data. The 
flow of data between partners in an ecosystem not only deepens the 
understanding of consumers but also strengthens collaboration in value 
delivery (Burstr om et al., 2021 ). Orchestrators can enhance value 
through big data analytics , which includes the collection and utilization 
of big data. To initiate this process, orchestrators collect and categorize big 
data on consumer and collaborator behavior based on digital architec -
tures (Still et al., 2014 ). This data can optimize the data mining algo-
rithms of companies within the ecosystem (Zeng et al., 2022 ). For 
instance, cloud-based big data analytic tools enable partners to jointly 
analyze operational data and proactively identify operational risks (Tian 
et al., 2021 ). As data volume reaches a sufficient scale, orchestrators can 
use data mining and machine learning algorithms to transform data into 
actionable information and stimulate network effects (Kamalaldin et al., 
2021; Zeng et al., 2022 ). Leveraging advanced learning algorithms al-
lows companies to explore a variety of solutions at a lower cost, reducing 
capital expenditure on designing heavy test samples or developing test 
sites (Kamalaldin et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, it aids ecosystem partners 
in accurately forecasting and meeting consumer behaviors, effectively 
satisfying market demands and sustainably building competitive ad-
vantages (Zeng et al., 2021 ). 
Based on our previous analysis, it is clear that ecosystem partners can 
access the ecosystem ’s technological framework by leveraging APIs. 
However, the inherent technological complexity associated with APIs 
may present certain limitations in their practical application. Conse -
quently, it is advisable for ecosystem orchestrators to make significant 
long-term investments in standardizing their technological infrastruc -
ture (Aagaard & Rezac, 2022 ). Orchestrators are committed to cham -
pioning industry standardization and interoperability to reduce access 
barriers for all ecosystem participants. A pivotal aspect of these 
orchestration activities involves standardizing technology, industry, and L. Shen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Journal of Business Research 173 (2024) 114463
13product requirements , which facilitates cost reduction, operational effi-
ciency, and ecosystem activation (Jovanovic, Kosti ˘c, et al., 2022; Lin-
gens, Boger, et al., 2021 ). Generic technologies are applicable across 
different markets (Azzam et al., 2017; Cen et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, 
Parida et al. (2019) highlight the importance of industrial and technical 
standards. In this context, ecosystem orchestrators collaborate with key 
partners to establish informal standards based on mutual commitment, 
followed by employing formal certification processes to gain broad 
acceptance among all partners (Parida et al., 2019 ). Additionally, 
modularizing resources is recognized as a crucial strategy to enhance 
accessibility and application, thereby lowering the entry barriers that 
might deter potential partners from embracing digital technologies. To 
achieve this, technologies must be flexible, allowing reuse in new ap-
plications and reconfiguring algorithms and systems to adapt to various 
user needs and contexts (Sjodin et al., 2021 ). This modularization in-
volves separating, repackaging, and encapsulating resources, making 
them easily accessible to ecosystem participants (Lu & Zhang, 2022 ). 
Modular resources help ecosystem partners better understand and select 
the tools and information required to develop applications more effi-
ciently (Schreieck et al., 2021 ), and these modules can be seamlessly 
integrated into a broader array of offerings (Sjodin et al., 2021 ). For 
example, Gomes et al. (2021) introduce a modularity knowledge strat-
egy where orchestrators can identify different modules and decide 
which ones to use for co-creation initiatives. 
This leads to the following proposition: 
Proposition 4.In orchestrating ecosystems, it is recommended that or-
chestrators adopt ecosystem technological leveraging practices, including 
establishing a secure and interconnected digital infrastructure, enhance value 
through big data analytics, and championing industry standardization and 
interoperability. These activities leverage technological advantages and pro-
mote openness and reciprocity within the ecosystem. 
4.5. Ecosystem innovation practices 
Innovation is a key driver of growth, propelling businesses towards 
excellence and competitive advantages (Gao et al., 2023; Shahzad et al., 
2022 ). Our analysis reveals that most studies on ecosystem orchestration 
place significant emphasis on innovation (Carida et al., 2022 ). 
Numerous innovations exhibit a systemic nature (Foss et al., 2023 ), and 
the concept of generativity is deeply ingrained in ecosystems (Autio, 
2022; Thomas & Tee, 2022 ). Some enterprises actively engage in eco-
systems with the expectation of collaboratively creating specific types of 
innovation (Gomes, dos Santos, et al., 2022 ), which cannot be achieved 
by individual enterprises alone. Successful ecosystems are often char-
acterized by collaborative partners who co-develop capabilities centered 
around pioneering innovations (Sjodin et al., 2022 ). Ecosystem inno-
vation promotes the formation and development of value proposition- 
driven ecosystems, ultimately bolstering the competitiveness and sus-
tainability of both individual firms and the entire ecosystem (Linde 
et al., 2021 ). The fifth identified practice, termed ecosystem innovation 
practices, encompasses a set of activities through which ecosystem or-
chestrators strive to enhance innovation within the ecosystem. 
The first key orchestration activity, labeled as instigating an 
innovation-centric ecosystem culture , involves orchestrators reframing 
the innovation mindset within the ecosystem to maintain its innovative -
ness (Mann et al., 2022 ). This continuous effort by the orchestrator is 
crucial for renewing the ecosystem, ensuring its sustainable competitive 
advantage in a dynamically changing environment. Currently, the 
perspective on innovation has shifted from firm centric to network 
centric (Zeng et al., 2021 ). Orchestrators need to shift partners ’ mindsets 
away from traditional value chains towards complementary co-creation, 
enabled by modularity and a shared vision, fostering an agile mindset 
that capitalizes on dynamic innovation capabilities (Aagaard & Rezac, 
2022 ) Adopting an agile innovation approach within the ecosystem is 
essential for ensuring customer centricity and solution resilience (Sjodin et al., 2022 ). Additionally, there is a need for continual adaptation of 
existing organizational structures and the redesign of business activities 
to align with innovative thinking (Lingens, Mieh ˘e, et al., 2021 ). For 
example, Zucchella and Previtali (2019) suggest that institutional 
frameworks, business activities, partnerships, and financial systems 
need to be redesigned to support business model innovation. Consid -
ering that exposure to information, knowledge, and opportunities is a 
prerequisite for innovation (Lingens & Huber, 2021 ), orchestrators need 
to introduce activities for early-stage innovation collaborative partnerships . 
This initiative increases the likelihood of partners recognizing and 
seizing opportunities for innovation. The process involves the careful 
selection and integration of partners in a joint innovation effort (Lin-
gens, Seeholzer, et al., 2022 ) and the alignment of various innovation 
efforts and resources (Reypens et al., 2021 ). Moreover, orchestrators 
leverage their expertise to transform pre-established collaborative 
structures into flexible systems, facilitating the creation of innovative 
outputs (Reypens et al., 2021 ). This can be achieved by redesigning and 
reorganizing processes, regulations, resources, and internal divisions to 
enable value co-creation with ecosystem partners (Lu & Zhang, 2022 ). 
The second key activity, termed promoting the collaboration inno-
vation process , includes building an innovation learning organization . This 
initiative aims to develop key technical expertise and discover new ap-
plications for successful orchestration models (Leten et al., 2013 ). 
Importantly, it not only enhances the innovation potential of partners 
but also solidifies the leadership role of ecosystem orchestrators. In 
fostering innovative collaboration, orchestrators assume a dual role. 
First, they lead by introducing novel ideas and solutions to the 
ecosystem. Tian et al. (2021) suggest that orchestrators should introduce 
innovative problem-solving approaches to ecosystem partners and pro-
vide knowledge services to stimulate value co-creation. Second, or-
chestrators facilitate by organizing agile innovation sprint meetings with 
partners to foster the generation and exchange of innovative ideas 
(Masucci et al., 2020; Ritala et al., 2013 ). Internal learning within the 
organization and the recruitment of expertise can help bridge knowl -
edge gaps (Lingens, Mieh ˘e, et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, collaboration 
with ecosystem partners can accelerate learning and innovation through 
the sharing and exchange of information, knowledge, and resources 
from various firms (Lingens & Huber, 2021; Poblete et al., 2022; Sjodin 
et al., 2022 ). Embracing a “fail fast, learn fast” mindset is crucial, along 
with continuously conducting training activities to thoroughly under -
stand market needs (Marheine et al., 2021 ). Moreover, as Laczko et al. 
(2019) highlight, orchestrators actively involve partners in developing 
innovative products, thereby increasing the profitability and “sticki -
ness” of partners to the ecosystem. 
The third key activity, termed commercializing and scaling inno-
vative projects , encompasses several critical steps. Initially, it involves 
evaluating and configuring innovation project ideas to capitalize on inno-
vation opportunities within current partnerships (Aagaard & Rezac, 
2022 ). During this phase, selection criteria, such as strategic impor -
tance, consistency, feasibility, urgency, and risk, are openly discussed 
and assessed to identify the most promising ideas (Gomes et al., 2021; 
Poblete et al., 2022 ). Following these evaluations, inter-organizational 
teams are swiftly formed to conduct preliminary studies and develop 
project plans. These form the basis for selecting innovative projects that 
merit further development (Poblete et al., 2022 ). The initial project 
proposal is then refined and expanded, culminating in the creation of a 
comprehensive project and risk plan (Reypens et al., 2021 ). It is crucial 
to note that innovative new products or services can only create value if 
successfully commercialized (Isckia et al., 2020 ). Additionally, high 
innovation potential significantly enhances a company ’s commerciali -
zation potential (Aagaard & Rezac, 2022 ). Orchestrators play a crucial 
role in devising a commercialization roadmap for innovation solutions , 
ensuring their commercial viability and scalability across global mar-
kets. This commercialization process requires efficient coupling and 
feedback mechanisms to ensure the commercial success of innovation 
(Isckia et al., 2020 ). L. Shen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Journal of Business Research 173 (2024) 114463
14This leads to the following proposition: 
Proposition 5.In orchestrating ecosystems, it is recommended that or-
chestrators adopt ecosystem innovation practices, which include instigating 
ecosystem-centric innovation culture, promoting collaborative innovation 
process, and commercializing and scaling innovative projects. These activities 
facilitate a rapid response to market changes and promote first-mover ad-
vantages and competitive advantages. 
4.6. Relationships among the ecosystem orchestration practices for 
industrial firms 
As depicted in Fig. 3, we present a synthesis of the interrelationships 
among five ecosystem orchestration practices: ecosystem strategic 
design practices, ecosystem relational practices, ecosystem resource 
integration practices, ecosystem technological leveraging practices, and 
ecosystem innovation practices. Taking the initial letters of each prac-
tice and emphasizing their continuous adjustment and dynamic nature 
with the “-ing” suffix, we have named this integrative conceptual 
framework the “stirring model of ecosystem orchestration.” These 
five practices metaphorically function as the stirrer of the ecosystem 
practices, maintaining dynamic equilibrium and preventing stagnation 
into a state of inertia. Firstly, the stirring model reflects the interactive 
characteristic of ecosystem orchestration practices with diverse out-
comes. The interaction processes between these practices influence 
dual-directional effects. For example, ecosystem strategic design prac-
tices act as the guiding force, constantly shaping and directing the other 
four practices. Conversely, the other four practices reciprocally reinforce 
the actualization and success of ecosystem strategic design practices 
goals. Secondly, the dynamic model mirrors the ongoing iterative nature 
of ecosystem orchestration, facilitating adaptability to the organiza -
tional context and external dynamic changes. This iterative character -
istic ensures the ecosystem’s dynamics, fostering the attainment of 
sustainable competitive advantages. 
Fig. 3 depicts a triangular relationship among ecosystem strategic 
design practices, ecosystem relational practices, and ecosystem resource 
integration practices. This configuration highlights the strategic design’s 
guiding role and the fundamental importance of ecosystem relational 
and resource integration practices. Strategic design practices provide 
overarching direction for other orchestration activities. Moreover, 
ecosystem actors often engage in complex and intertwined relationships 
and resources, and the practices that orchestrate these elements lay a 
solid groundwork for overall ecosystem orchestration. Consequently, we 
propose: 
Proposition 6.1. Ecosystem strategic design practices, relational prac-
tices, and resource integration practices collectively constitute the core 
structure for effective ecosystem orchestration. 
The inner circle of Fig. 3, the other two practices, resembling two 
wings of a triangular orchestration structure, are constituted by inno-
vation practices and technological leveraging practices. These practices 
play distinct roles in ecosystem orchestration for industrial firms. Firstly, 
they act as additional conduits linking ecosystem strategic design 
practices with ecosystem relational and resource integration practices. 
These connections enable orchestrators and partners to pursue a shared 
value proposition, expanding the value of resource and relationship 
orchestration practices. Advanced technologies and incremental in-
novations exert a leveraging effect in orchestrating resources and re-
lationships. Deploying innovative technology can increase productivity 
and simultaneously decrease inter-firm communication costs. Incre -
mental innovation practices facilitate the gradual enhancement of 
products or services and optimize resource distribution through exper -
imentation and improvement. Secondly, technology and innovation 
serve as sources of relationships and resources. Disruptive technologies 
and radical innovation practices introduce digital resources, making 
attracting active partners and catalyzing new relationships and resources more feasible. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the inter-
action among these practices is bi-directional. Orchestrators and part-
ners utilize ecosystem resources and the trust established in mutual 
relationships to continually advance technology and innovation 
(Aagaard & Rezac, 2022; Lingens, Huber, et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2021). 
Additionally, reflecting the complex interplay of relationships and re-
sources among partners, innovation, and technology are interdependent 
and tightly interwoven. Therefore, we propose: 
Proposition 6.2. Ecosystem technological leveraging practices and inno-
vation practices are complementary ecosystem orchestration practices and 
play a crucial role in expanding ecosystem. 
In summary, the aforementioned practices constitute our stirring 
model of ecosystem orchestration. As depicted in the outer circle of 
Fig. 3, we assert that ecosystem strategic design practices play a pivotal 
role in forming a shared value proposition among partners, which is 
foundational for the ecosystem’s existence. Driven by this shared value 
proposition, increasing partners and resources are continuously inte-
grated into the ecosystem. Ecosystem relational practices enhance 
ecosystem stability, while ecosystem resource integration practices 
improve resource mobility. These practices contribute significantly to 
ecosystem resilience. Interdependent and reciprocal partnerships facil-
itate adaptability to market changes and risks, and the sharing and 
optimization of resources among ecosystem members promote sustain -
able resource utilization. The significance of technology and innovation 
is increasingly apparent in the digital era. Orchestrators leverage these 
elements for ecosystem transformation and breakthroughs. Ecosystem 
technological leveraging practices foster openness and reciprocity 
within the ecosystem, and ecosystem innovation practices enable the 
creation of first-mover advantages, contributing to ecosystem vitality. In 
essence, these five practices are all aligned toward achieving the joint 
value proposition of the ecosystem. 
Therefore, we propose: 
Proposition 6.3. Ecosystem strategic design practices, relational prac-
tices, resource integration practices, technological leveraging practices, and 
innovation practices collectively form the “stirring model” of ecosystem 
orchestration, providing an competitive framework for orchestrating 
ecosystems. 
5.Conclusion 
5.1. Theoretical contributions 
In the era of Industry 4.0, where digital technologies rapidly evolve, 
ecosystems play a more crucial role than individual business actors. The 
contribution of this study to the ecosystem literature is twofold. First, in 
terms of methodology, we used a qualitative meta-analysis of ecosystem 
orchestration. This approach, which integrated 31 studies with 111 
business cases, differs from previous ecosystem studies focusing on 
single industries or countries. By drawing insights from diverse com-
panies, ranging from traditional manufacturing and service industries to 
digitally emerging high-tech companies, this study enhances the 
contextual applicability and external validity of our findings. Addi-
tionally, it enriches the literature with a broader, more diverse 
perspective on ecosystem orchestration, potentially leading to the 
emergence of new theories. 
Secondly, from the perspective of the business actor in the 
ecosystem, our primary focus rests on the ecosystem orchestrator (i.e., 
focal firm, ecosystem leader). We systematically summarize the 
orchestration practices performed by the orchestrators, elucidating how 
they implement specific ecosystem orchestration activities. Our data 
analysis identifies five primary ecosystem orchestration practices 
(ecosystem strategic design practices, ecosystem relational practices, 
ecosystem resource integration practices, ecosystem technological 
leveraging practices, and ecosystem innovation practices) and L. Shen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Journal of Business Research 173 (2024) 114463
15delineates 15 key orchestration activities and 30 sub-orchestration ac-
tivities. Moreover, we present a holistic framework that integrates these 
practices, responding to the recent call by Autio (2022) for research on 
specific actions that leading firms can take to orchestrate their 
ecosystem successfully. 
5.2. Managerial implications 
Given the diverse industries covered in our cases, our framework on 
ecosystem orchestration practices serves as a valuable practical guide 
for ecosystem leaders. More specifically, we offer insights for ecosystem 
orchestrators to develop specific roles and balance different orchestra -
tion practices. Especially beneficial for companies new to being or-
chestrators, our framework provides direction for effective 
orchestration. In addition, this paper details the specific orchestration 
activities that are operating in practice, offering a hands-on practical 
approach for ecosystem orchestrators and, thereby, minimizing costly 
errors and detours. Simultaneously, our findings assist experienced or-
chestrators in self-evaluation. By checking their operations against the 
15 key orchestration activities, companies can identify areas for 
refinement, overcome development bottlenecks, and effectively realize 
common value propositions. In addition, companies that aspire to 
become ecosystem orchestrators can employ this framework to 
comprehensively evaluate their capabilities, enhance their strengths, 
and address their weaknesses, ultimately positioning themselves as 
orchestrators. 
5.3. Limitations and suggestions for future research 
The limitations of this paper reside in the research methodology and 
in the content of the study. Regarding research methodology, our 
qualitative meta-analysis approach presents certain challenges regarding 
replication. The complex case collection and filtering process can be 
daunting, and our study primarily relies on original authors ’ in-
terpretations of raw qualitative data, potentially deviating from the raw 
data. Additionally, this process may have lost contextual information 
from the original studies (Combs et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, our study 
provides a comprehensive and general understanding of ecosystem 
orchestration. Another limitation is the interpretation of the study topic. 
While we have carefully selected sources from multiple databases, there 
may still be omissions of important literature. Furthermore, our study 
did not explore the orchestration practices from a longitudinal 
perspective, potentially missing the dynamic changes that occur in 
different stages of ecosystem development. 
Based on an analysis of the literature, we have identified several 
research gaps and proposed numerous avenues for future studies related 
to ecosystem orchestration practices. Table 4 presents the research gaps 
in the extant literature and the potential research questions.
