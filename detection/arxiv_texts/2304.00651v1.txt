Abstract
This paper investigates whether ideological indoctrination by living in a communist
regime relates to low economic performance in a market economy. We recruit North
Korean refugees and measure their implicit bias against South Korea by using the
Implicit Association Test. Conducting double auction and bilateral bargaining market
experiments, we nd that North Korean refugees with a larger bias against the
capitalistic society have lower expectations about their earning potential, exhibit
trading behavior with lower target prots, and earn less prots. These associations are
robust to conditioning on correlates of preferences, human capital, and assimilation
experiences.

1arXiv:2304.00651v1  [econ.GN]  2 Apr 20231 Introduction
Societies are founded on a particular set of social values. Citizens are inculcated with these
social values through various channels, such as education from parents and teachers, mass
media, and legal institutions (Lott, 1999; Bowles and Gintis, 2011; Cantoni and Yuchtman,
2013). A famous example is the Soviet Union, which promoted propaganda about creating
Homo sovieticus |a new kind of human being who is seless, learned, healthy, muscular,
and enthusiastic in spreading the Socialist Revolution (Zinoviev, 1983; Shiller et al., 1991).
This large-scale attempt of so-called human remodelling impacts people's beliefs and atti-
tudes. Even in decades after the collapse of the Soviet regime, we can still see the legacies
of ideological indoctrination (Alesina and Fuchs-Sch undeln, 2007; Pop-Eleches and Tucker,
2017). Diverging political attitudes exist toward laissez faire and state interventions across
countries depending on their historical experiences (Benabou, 2008; Cantoni et al., 2017).
In this study, we examine whether ideological indoctrination by living in an authoritarian
communist regime relates to low economic performance in a market economy. To answer this
question, we focus on a unique group of people|North Korean (NK) refugees residing in
South Korea (SK).1Since Korea was divided into North and South in 1948 as a consequence
of the Korean War, two contrasting regimes have emerged and moved forward in the two
parts of the Korean peninsula; a market economy and democracy in SK versus a centrally
panned economy and authoritarian communist regime in NK. NK leaders decided to insulate
their country from the rest of the world and inculcated their citizens with their own political
ideology. One of the key components in NK's political propaganda is the implantation of
antipathy toward capitalism. The Juche ideology, translated into \we-centeredness," acclaims
the Great Fight against capitalist imperialism and identies the U.S. and SK as primary
enemies. As a consequence, NKs are gradually instilled with the creed that \socialism is
superior to capitalism" and that \South Korea and the U.S. are the biggest enemies." Having
this deeply embedded mindset, such indoctrination could have a persisting eect on their
economic behavior, even long after leaving their home country and resettling in SK|more
than 11 years in our sample.2
There are two major methodological challenges in this study. The rst concerns a mea-
surement problem|how to measure NK refugees' bias against SK society. It is not only
dicult to dene but also deeply rooted in the mindset, and the deeper it is located, the
more dicult it is to extract. We adapt the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to our context,
a test that is widely used for implicit attitudes in social and behavioral sciences (see, e.g.,
1We use the acronyms of NK and SK to refer to both a person (North Korean and South Korean) and
the country (North Korea and South Korea).
2We provide a detailed explanation of indoctrination in NK in Online Appendix D.
2Greenwald et al., 2009; Beaman et al., 2009; Lowes et al., 2015; Jost et al., 2009; Stanley
et al., 2011).
Using the IAT, we measure the antipathy toward SK (or the anity for NK) and interpret
the test's score as a proxy for implicit bias against the capitalist society of SK. To stimulate
the implicit bias, our design presents four national symbols of each country: a country map,
the national ag, a photo image of a soldier in the national army uniform, and the ocial
name of the country. We ask subjects to associate the symbols with words of good or bad
attributes, while a timer unobserved by subjects is running. This allows us to measure the
strength of an individual's implicit bias against a country. For example, NK refugees who are
more biased against SK would take longer to respond correctly to a sorting problem when
SK is associated with a word with a positive connotation.
The second challenge is an identication problem. Our objective is to examine the asso-
ciation between bias against the capitalistic society and market earnings. Studies with ob-
servational data are subject to identication; this is because individuals' market outcomes,
such as earnings and wealth, are determined by numerous other factors, such as preferences,
skills, and constraints. For example, NK refugees who are more biased against SK may also
be more disadvantaged in the SK labor market with other reasons.
To resolve this identication problem, we resort to a controlled laboratory market where
participants seek prots on a level playing eld without facing any dierential market con-
straints. Another advantage of the market experiment is that we could control for the par-
ticipants' economic preferences by assigning buyers' values and sellers' costs randomly. The
market experiment utilizes continuous double auction institutions  a la Smith (1962). We de-
sign two types of markets with this institution|double auction (DA) markets with multiple
buyers and sellers and bilateral bargaining (BB) markets with only one buyer and one seller.
We use the amount of money earned in the market experiment as the outcome of main inter-
est. In addition, to mitigate the concerns of omitted variable bias, we collect various potential
confounding factors, including a set of human capital measures, economic preferences, and
information on NK refugees' life experiences back in NK and settlement experiences in SK.
We nd that NK refugees with a larger bias against SK earn less prots in both DA
and BB markets. This nding holds robust to conditioning on the potential confounding
factors. To understand mechanisms underlying that association, using the Becker-DeGroot-
Marschak (BDM) design, we measure subjects' expectations about the prots they can earn
in the market and show that NK refugees with a larger bias have lower expectations about
their earning potential. Furthermore, using micro-level data of trading behavior, we show
that NK refugees with a larger bias tend to engage in trading with a lower target prot, which
in turn results in lower actual prots. These ndings lend strong support to the hypothesis
3that NK refugees with a larger bias against the capitalistic society underperform in the
market due to their trading behavior with low aspiration.
Our study contributes to the literature on the long-term eect of life experiences, es-
pecially the experience of growing up in a communist regime, on later-life attitudes, be-
liefs, and economic behaviors (e.g., Shiller et al., 1991; Alesina and Fuchs-Sch undeln, 2007;
Cantoni et al., 2017; Pop-Eleches and Tucker, 2017; Laudenbach et al., 2019). Particularly,
Fuchs-Sch undeln and Masella (2016) and Laudenbach et al. (2020) compared East and West
Germans after their reunication and found that longer exposure to communism is associ-
ated with lower investment in human capital, lower wages in the labor market, and poor
nancial decision. However, as Becker et al. (2020) pointed out, East and West Germans are
not comparable in various aspects; thus these studies with observation data face the issue of
identication.
Although we also utilize people from a communist country, our study does not suer
the same concern, given that we focus on heterogeneity among NK refugees rather than
comparing them with SK natives and use a controlled laboratory outcome. In this sense,
in terms of research design, our study is in line with Laudenbach et al. (2019), who looked
at variations among East Germans in their emotional tagging to the communist system
and whether positive or negative emotional tags shape long-run beliefs about capitalism
versus communism. Our study provides novel insight into this literature by showing that NK
refugees' bias against the capitalistic society is closely related to their market behaviors and
economic performance.
The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains our experiments and surveys,
including the IAT method. Section 3 presents the main ndings from our market experiments.
In Section 4, we explore mechanisms underlying our ndings. Section 5 contains a discussion
about our results.
2 Research Design and Data Collection
2.1 Recruiting Subjects
We recruited subjects in collaboration with Nielsen Korea between late June and mid-
July 2016. To construct a representative sample of NK refugees residing in SK, we used the
stratied sampling method of recruiting NK refugees in terms of age, gender, and year of
entry into SK. Then, as a benchmark group, we recruited SK natives to match the distribution
of age and gender with those of NK refugees.
In total, 289 NK refugees and 295 SK natives participated in our study. They were as-
signed to 20 sessions; four sessions with only SK native participants, three sessions with only
4NK refugees, and 13 sessions with both groups of subjects together. Forming the groups of
eight subjects for the DA market experiment, we have 17 groups with only NK refugees (NK-
only Market), 17 groups with only SK natives participants (SK-only Market), and 41 groups
with both NK refugees and SK natives (Mixed Market).3In most of mixed markets (36 out
of 41), we have the same number of NK refugees and South Koreans and assigned two from
each of NK refugees and South Koreans to play the role of buyers. The nal sample consists
of 287 NK refugees and 287 SK natives by eliminating 10 subjects, 6 replacement subjects
from Nielsen Korea to form groups and 4 subjects who exhibited too erratic behavior in
the IAT (see Nosek et al., 2014). On average, subjects earned 68,000 Korean Won (KRW),
including 40,000 KRW as a participation fee (as of July 2016, the exchange rate was approx-
imately 1,000 KRW = 1 USD). We had a relatively high participation fee because most of
the participants are non-students; thus, we need to provide a larger incentive compared to
that given typically to a sample of university students. The experiment and survey lasted
approximately 2 hours.
Online Appendix C.1 shows the basic sociodemographic characteristics of our NK and SK
subjects. In anticipation of exploiting the variation within NK subjects, it is worth noting
that NK refugees are heterogeneous in their length of stay in NK and SK. We expect that
the longer NK refugees have stayed in NK, the stronger bias they exhibit against SK. On
average, they spent 27 years in NK and approximately 12 years outside of the country. The
average duration of stay in SK is 7.3 years. The variation in the length of stay in NK is large:
the minimum number of years in NK is 8 and the maximum is 52.
2.2 Market Experiments
We conducted two market experiments, starting with the standard continuous DA mar-
ket. At the beginning of the experiment, the computer randomly forms groups of eight
anonymous subjects. These groups participate in seven rounds of the DA market. We run
two practice rounds before the rst round to ensure that all subjects understand the experi-
ment rules. After the DA market, the subjects participate in three rounds of a one-on-one BB
market with the same format as that of the DA market, by being randomly matched with
another subject in the same group. All the experiments are computerized and conducted
using the experimental software z-Tree (Fischbacher, 2007). Instructions regarding all the
experiments and surveys are reported in Online Appendix A.
Double auction market. We use the standard market experiment tool with continuous
DA institution (e.g., Smith, 1962). Each market consists of four buyers and four sellers. The
3Online Appendix C.2 reports a balance test results of NK refugees between NK only and Mixed markets.
Overall NK refugees are well-balanced in many aspects despite small samples.
5subjects are randomly assigned to the roles of buyers and sellers, which are xed through-
out seven rounds of the market. Each seller has one unit of a ctitious commodity with a
reservation price in KRW, known only to herself, which represents the minimum price at
which she is willing to relinquish one unit of the commodity. Each buyer receives a value
in KRW, known only to herself, which represents the maximum willingness to pay for one
unit of the ctitious commodity. Four buyers in a market have four dierent values|13,000,
17,000, 21,000, and 25,000|and four sellers have four dierent reservation prices|2,000,
6,000, 10,000, and 14,000. Although the role of a buyer or a seller is xed throughout seven
rounds of the market, each buyer's value or each seller's reservation price is randomly drawn
from the sets in each round. The notion of competitive equilibrium predicts three units of
the commodity to be traded at a price range between 13,000 and 14,000.
Each market lasts for 180 seconds. Both buyers and sellers are allowed to freely post
the prices they want to buy or sell within each round. We note that they can update their
posted prices as many times as they want during the given time. These posted prices are
public information within a group. If the subjects want to make a transaction on a posted
price, they can simply click that posted price and then press the OK button. If a buyer and
a seller make a transaction, then they are out of the market, since only one transaction is
possible for each subject. The payo of a buyer is the dierence between her value and the
transaction price. The payo of a seller is the dierence between the transaction price and
her reservation price. We call both payos as prots. If they do not make a transaction, then
they have zero prot in the market.
Eliciting expectation about prots. Before starting the last round of the DA market,
we elicit subjects' (ex-ante) expected value of participating in the last-round market, by using
the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) design (Becker et al., 1964). Specically, the subjects
are presented with ten-row decision problems and asked to choose whether their earnings at
the last round are determined by their performance in that market or given a xed amount
of money. As the row goes down, the xed amount of money increases from 1,000 KRW to
10,000 KRW in increments of 1,000 KRW. We enforce a single crossing point to measure
their willingness to participate in the market. After this elicitation procedure, they play the
last round of the market. When the market ends, the computer randomly selects one out of
the ten rows. The payo obtained by a subject at the last round is determined by her choice
of that selected row between a xed amount of money and the prot earned in the market.
At the end of the session, each subject's earnings from the DA market were determined
by the sum of payos obtained in two randomly drawn rounds among these seven rounds.
Bilateral bargaining market. The process of the BB market is identical to the DA
market except that there are only one buyer and one seller. We choose to conduct this design
6to obtain a measure of individuals' performance in the simplest situation without spillover
beyond bilateral interaction and minimize loads of cognition in processing information.
In each group of four buyers and four sellers, four pairs of one buyer and one seller are
randomly matched in each round to play three rounds of two-person BB market. In each
round of BB, the buyer and seller randomly receive one value that was used in the DA market
experiment.
The amount of surplus to be negotiated by the pair is equal to the dierence between the
value assigned to the buyer and the reservation price assigned to the seller. They negotiate
for 90 seconds over the unknown surplus by submitting the prices at which they want to
transact. If the pair would agree within the time limit, the buyer would obtain earnings equal
to the dierence between her value and the price on which the pair agreed, and the seller's
earnings would be equal to the dierence between the price on which the pair agreed and
her reservation price. At the end of the session, one of the three rounds of BB is randomly
chosen for the actual payment in this part of the experiment.
2.3 Implicit Association Test
At the end of the session, we conduct the IAT to measure each subject's bias against SK,
which we use as a measure of ideological bias against the capitalistic society of SK. We use
a simplied version of the IAT, the Brief Implicit Association Test (Sriram and Greenwald,
2009; Nosek et al., 2014). This test is to measure the strength of an individual's unconscious
association between categories of NK or SK and words of positive and negative attributes.
We select four stimulus images that are clearly identiable for the categories of NK and SK,
as shown in Figure 1a: the national ags of two Koreas, the maps of two Koreas, two Koreas'
uniformed soldiers, and the ocial full names of the two Koreas{|the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (NK) and the Republic of Korea (SK). We also select four stimulus words
that transparently belong to each of the positive and negative attributes.
The IAT consists of one practice block and four subsequent blocks. The practice block
comprises 20 questions to acquaint subjects with the stimulus items and sorting rules. The
four subsequent blocks focus on two contrasting conditions of categories and attributes|
\North Korea and good" and \South Korea and good." In each block, subjects are required
to answer 20 sorting questions. To control the order eect, we randomize the sequence of
blocks at the individual level. The information on a pair of categories and attributes is
presented at the top of the computer screen, dening the subject's sorting task in the block.
One of the four stimulus images or words appears randomly in the middle of the screen across
20 questions within the block. Upon its appearance on the screen, the subject must quickly
gure out whether the stimulus item belongs to either a category or an attribute associated
7with that block (i.e., presented at the top of the screen). If the stimulus was consistent
(resp. inconsistent) with the pair of categories on the top, the subject would hit a key on
the right (resp. left) side of the keyboard. This process occurs over a randomized sequence of
20 dierent stimuli. Sample screens of the IAT and additional details are provided in Online
Appendix A.
We follow the psychology literature by constructing the IAT score as the numerical mea-
sure of the strength of the implicit association with SK relative to NK. The IAT score is
computed for each individual as the dierence between the average response time for blocks
with the condition of \South Korea and good" and the average response time for blocks with
the condition of \North Korea and good" divided by the standard deviation of response times
across them. As a result, the score ranges between -2 and 2 (Nosek et al., 2014). Note that if
a subject is able to sort the stimulus items more quickly when NK is matched with a word
of good attribute, the IAT score is positive. It is negative otherwise. Hence, the higher the
score is the stronger bias against SK the subject has.
We use the IAT score as a proxy for ideological bias against the capitalistic society of
SK. Given the historical (and still ongoing) ideological conict between NK and SK as a
consequence of the Cold War, it is reasonable to interpret that dierences in the IAT score
are driven by the extent to which NK refugees are biased against SK for reasons related to
their attitudes toward political and economic systems. However, we are also open to other
possibilities that the IAT score captures something more personal, such as NK refugees'
homesickness and their assimilation experiences in SK. In response to such concerns, we
collect detailed individual characteristics, as will be explained in the next subsection and
control them in establishing the link between the IAT and market earnings.
2.4 Control Variables
After the subjects completed the market experiments, we conduct a series of cognitive
and psychology tests and demographics surveys, through which we try to collect as much
information as possible to control for potential confounding factors in the regression analysis.
In addition to the sociodemographic information of both subjects, we collect the following
extra information.
First, we collect a set of human capital measurements known to matter for economic
outcomes in the market. We use standard Raven's progressive matrices for cognitive abilities,
a Big Five personality test for non-cognitive skills, and ECON 101 and nancial literacy tests
for economic knowledge. We discuss the details in Online Appendix C.4.
Second, we measure each subject's risk preference. The subjects are asked to make de-
cisions from a series of multiple price lists. Choi et al. (2021) provide the full details of the
8risk preferences experiment. We compute individual-level risk premiums as a measure of risk
aversion.
Finally, for NK refugees, we collect a rich set of variables regarding their life experiences
in NK and their assimilation in SK. These include economic class in NK, education level in
NK, informal market experience, military service, communist party member, regions from
bordering China, birthplace, income, quality of life in SK, and whether they have family
members left in NK. We present the summary statistics of the full set of variables in Online
Appendix C.1.
3 Empirical Results
3.1 Validation of IAT Measure
We begin by validating the IAT score as a measure of ideological bias against a capitalist
country. First, we compare NK subjects with the benchmark group of SK subjects. We expect
that NK subjects are overall more biased against SK than SK natives. Second, we examine
the heterogeneity among NK subjects. Given the presumption that the bias is formed by
ideological indoctrination in NK, we expect that the longer people stay in NK, the more
likely they hold to a bias against SK. Lastly, we directly compare the IAT measure with the
survey responses regarding attitudes toward a market economy and democracy.
Between-group comparison. Figure 1b shows the kernel density estimates of the IAT
scores for NK and SK subjects. A subject is dened as neutral if the IAT score is 0; biased
against SK if the score is positive. We nd that while the majority of subjects in both
NK and SK groups exhibit pro-SK attitudes, the proportion of pro-NK subjects whose IAT
score is positive is 30.3% among NK subjects, much larger than 4.5% for SK subjects. On
average, NK subjects have higher IAT score than SK subjects: the average IAT scores of
NK and SK subjects are -0.27 and -0.69, respectively. The average score gap between NK
and SK subjects is 0.42, which is statistically signicant ( p-value<0.01). This between-group
comparison conrms our rst validation check that NK subjects are on average more biased
against SK than SK subjects.
Within-group comparison. Looking at the within-group variation among NK subjects
as in Figure 1b, we examine whether the IAT score is associated with the number of years they
spent in NK. We interpret the number of years in NK as a proxy for the degree of exposure
to NK's ideological indoctrination against SK. Table 1 presents the regression analysis of
the IAT score on the number of years in NK. Column (1) shows the unconditional estimate
without any controls, and column (2) with the full set of controls explained in Section 2.4.
The results show that the IAT score is positively correlated to the number of years in
9NK. According to the point estimate in column (2), one additional year in NK is associated
with a 0.013 point increase in the IAT score. To illustrate the magnitude of the estimate,
we multiply the estimate (0.013) by the sample average number of years in NK (27.5). The
predicted increase in the IAT score amounts to 85% of the average IAT score gap between
NK and SK subjects.
In addition, we nd that the communist party indicator is positively correlated with the
IAT score. This is also in line with the presumption that the IAT score captures the degree
of ideological indoctrination. We also nd NK subjects who belonged to a lower class in NK
have a higher IAT score.
Finally, we check the association between the IAT score and explicit attitudes toward
market economy and democracy measured by questions borrowed from the World Values
Survey. The details of survey questions are provided in Online Appendix C.3. We nd that,
for NK subjects, the correlations of the IAT score with the preferences for a market economy
and democracy are signicantly negative; -0.14 with the support for a market economy
(Pearson correlation test, p-value<0:01) and -0.18 with the support for democracy (Pearson
correlation test, p-value<0:01). This nding further suggests that the variation in the IAT
score is driven by the extent to which NK refugees are biased against SK for reasons related
to their attitudes to political and economic systems.
3.2 IAT and Market Earnings
We examine the association of ideological bias measured by the IAT score with the
prots that subjects earn in market experiments. Our market experiments oer a controlled
environment that creates a level playing eld for our subjects with dierent sets of skills and
experiences in seeking economic gains. On top of this, we analyze the association between
ideological bias and prots by controlling for potential confounding factors.
Our regression equation is as follows:
Yigr=IAT i+Zigr+Xi+g+r+igr (3.1)
where the dependent variable, Yigr, is the amount of prots (in the unit of 1,000 KRW)
earned by subject iin groupg(consisting of eight subjects) in round r,r= 1;:::;6. If the
subject does not succeed in trading, then his or her prot is zero. IAT iis the IAT score of
the subject i, sois the coecient of our main interest. Zigris a vector of buyers' values and
sellers' costs, which varies randomly within individuals over rounds. Xiis a vector of control
variables representing individual characteristics ranging from demographic characteristics to
human capital measures. We include group- and round-specic xed eects, gandrin
10all specications. We obtain robust standard errors clustered at the individual level. We
estimate the same equation for the DA and BB markets, separately.
Table 2 presents the results for the DA market (columns (1)-(4) in Panel A) and the
BB market (columns (5)-(8) in Panel B), respectively, in the same format. Columns (1) and
(5) present the results for all observations with basic sociodemographic controls. Columns
(2) and (6) present the results for the markets where both NK and SK subjects participate
(mixed markets). To distinguish the association of the IAT score to prots between NK and
SK subjects, we interact the IAT score with each of NK and SK indicators. In addition to
the basic controls, we further control the set of economic preferences and human capital
variables. Columns (3) and (7) present the results for the sample of the NK-only markets
with additional controls of variables specic to NK subjects as discussed in Section 2.4.
Lastly, columns (4) and (8) presents the results for the sample of SK-only markets.
In the DA markets (panel A), we nd that NK subjects with a higher IAT score earn less
prots. The estimates in columns (1) and (2) are statistically signicant at the one percent
level. To interpret the economic size of the point estimate, we use the average IAT score gap
between NK and SK subjects (0.42) and calculate the predicted eect on prots when the
IAT score is increased by the NK-SK IAT gap. The predicted eect is 0.26 in all markets and
0.21 in mixed markets, corresponding to about 4-5% of the sample median prot (the median
prot is 5 for both NK and SK subjects). When we use the sample of the NK-only market,
we nd that the estimate remains signicant and even larger in terms of the magnitude.
Turning to SK subjects, we nd that the IAT score is not signicantly associated with
prots. In columns (1) and (2), the interaction term of IAT with SK indicator is negative
but insignicant. The result for SK subjects in the SK-only market (column (4)) reports
basically the same nding. We cannot fully explain why the results are so dierent between
NK and SK subjects. One possible explanation is that the IAT captures dierent things for
NK and SK subjects. For example, for SK subjects, the IAT possibly captures the attitude
of dissidents, which is unlikely to aect prots.
The results from the BB market (panel B) are similar to those from the DA market;
NK subjects with a higher IAT score earn less prots in the BB market as well. Again, the
association is not signicant among SK subjects. The magnitude of the eect remains similar
in NK subjects. For example, if we use the point estimate in column (7) with the sample
of the NK-only market, an increase in IAT score by the average gap between NK and SK
subjects is associated with a reduction of prots by 7%.
114 Mechanisms
To explain the association between the IAT score and prots for NK subjects, we pro-
pose the following hypotheses on expectation and trading behavior. First, NK subjects with
a higher IAT score have a lower expectation about prots from the market. Second, the
lower expectation could self-fulll by participating with a lower aspiration level and actually
earning lower prots in the market: NK subjects with a higher IAT score engage in trading
with a lower \target prot," that is, are more likely to bid low-prot oers.
4.1 Expectation about Prots
To test the rst hypothesis, we examine how the BDM-elicited expectation is related to
the IAT score. We run the regression of the IAT score on the expected prot with the full set
of control variables we used in our regression for prots and the average amount of prots
that each subject earned in the rst six rounds before the implementation of BDM.
Table 3 presents the results in the same format as in Table 2. The results are consistent
with our hypothesis. We nd that NK subjects with a higher IAT score tend to have lower
expectations about prots. Consistent with the results in Table 2, the association is only
signicant for NK subjects. The association for SK subjects is insignicant. It is also worth
noting that the eects are larger in magnitude for the expected prots than for the actual
prots. For example, using the point estimate in column (3), the eect of an increase in the
IAT score by the NK-SK gap is about 17% of the median prot.
A natural next question is whether the lower expectation of earnings prior to market
participation really aects their behaviors in the market. One potential channel is that
subjects with a lower IAT score engage in trading with a lower aspiration of earnings or a
lower \target prots," that is, they are more likely to make or accept low-price oers and
seek prots less actively. In the next subsection, we investigate the association of IAT score
with subjects' trading behavior at the micro level|behaviors of proposing and accepting
individual oers.
4.2 Target Prots in the Market
We next turn to trade behavior regarding subjects' target prot in the market experiments
to understand the association of the IAT score and prots. We use individuals' bidding data
to construct the variable of target prot. Let bijgrdenote the amount of the j-th bid that
subjectisubmits in group gand roundr. Note that the subjects can submit as many bids
as they want to. Then, we compute sijgr=bijgr cigrfor sellers and sijgr=vigr bijgrfor
buyers, where cigrandvigrare the cost and value of the commodity for sellers and buyers,
respectively. If the bid is accepted by the other participant, the target prot associated with
12that bid is realized and becomes the subject's prot. We take the average of sijgrfor allj's
in roundrand use it as a proxy variable for the subject's target prot.
Before examining the association between the IAT score and this trading behavior, we
examine whether a lower target prot indeed leads to lower prots. Figure 2a shows the
relationship between the actual prots and target prots. In Figure 2a, we divide the NK
sample in each of the DA and BB markets by 20 equal-sized groups, depending on the level
of their target prots. Then, we plot the mean of actual prot in each group. We observe
a strong positive association between target prots and actual prots for the NK subjects.
Online Appendix C.5 reports the regression results that conrm the patterns in Figure 2a.
It suggests that lower actual prots are driven by subjects' lower aspirations of earnings in
trading. This correlation pattern is also found for the SK subjects (see Figure C.5.1).
Figure 2b presents the estimated coecients of IAT and their 95% condence intervals
for the NK subjects from the regression analysis on subjects' target prots with equation
(3.1). The results are presented for each market type of the DA and BB markets. We observe
a strong negative association between IAT and target prots: NK subjects with a higher IAT
score engage in trading with a lower target prot. The average target prot is around 7.7 in
the DA and 9.6 in the BB markets. For instance, in the Mixed DA market (rst coecient),
an increase in NK-SK IAT gap decreases target prot by 12.5%. All of these coecients
are signicant at 5% level. For the SK subjects, we do not nd any signicant correlation
between them (see Figure C.5.2).
Online Appendix C.6 reports that IAT is related to other trading behaviors, such as
passivity in trading and the number of bidding which imply other possible mechanisms.
5 Discussions
Given the historical conicts between NK and SK as a consequence of the Cold War,
we interpret that our measure of IAT score captures NK subjects' implicit bias against the
capitalistic society of SK. We show that this bias is associated with negative performance
in the market through trading with a low aspiration of earnings. However, we acknowledge
other possibilities of explaining our ndings and discuss our attempts to rule them out.
First, the measure of IAT score may capture something other than ideological bias against
capitalist SK. For instance, it can capture subjects' unobserved human capital or prefer-
ences, which in turn aect economic performance in the market experiment. Alternatively
it can reect NK subjects' diculties in assimilation into SK for various reasons including
homesickness, which are correlated with market earnings. To mitigate these concerns, in the
regression analysis, we used an extensive list of NK refugees' characteristics, including a set
of human capital variables and their experiences in NK and SK. In this robustness analysis,
13following the spirit of Altonji et al. (2005), we examined whether the estimated association
is much aected by the inclusion of controls that, a priori, should be correlated with market
earnings. We nd that the association of the IAT remains robust to additional correlates of
unobserved preferences, human capital, and experiences of assimilating into SK.
Second, the variation of market earnings in the experiment may reect dierences in
motivation or preferences regarding eort provision in the articial environment of the ex-
periment, which may in turn be correlated with the IAT score. To address this concern, we
use the number of bidding in a given market as a proxy for motivations of eort provision
and add it in the specications of Table 2. We nd that the association between the IAT
and prots remains robust to the inclusion of this in Online Appendix C.7.
Finally, our measure of ideological bias could be too coarse in the sense that it could not
pinpoint only the contrast between two economic regimes{capitalism versus socialism. We
deliberately chose to use stimulus images that clearly contrast between NK and SK. Because
a confrontation between capitalism and socialism is the most salient and important nature of
the conicts between NK and SK, it is plausible to assume that the stimulus images used in
the IAT aroused the subjects' attitudes toward economic regimes. Applying stimulus images
specic to economic regimes is a potential avenue for future research.

21Online Appendix A. Instruction  
 
Online Appendix A.1. Experiment  
 
Thank you for your participation.  
 
We got IRB approval from Seoul Nation University. IRB No. 1606/002 -003, Date 2016.6.21  
 
You are not allowed to talk to others during the experiment, except to ask the experimenter a 
question. Please turn off your cell phone.  
 
 
Outline of the experiment:  
 
This experiment consists of three parts. You will be briefed before each stage of the experiment. 
At the end of this experiment, you will receive a cash reward. Details of determining the reward 
amount differ for each part of the experiment, so please ensure you understand the following 
explanation of each parts.  
 
Earnings in the experiment:  
Your total remuneration for today will be determined by the sum of your earnings in each 
stage, in addition to the basic participation reward of KRW45,000.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Part 1.  
In the first stage of the experiment, you will be assigned the role of either a sell er or a buyer. 
In a market with both buyers and sellers, the sellers and buyers will earn money by selling or 
buying an imaginary item.  
 
Formation of market  
Eight participants in this room get to form a single market. Half of the participants in each 
marke t get to play the role of seller, and other half get to play the role of buyer. The 
formation of groups and roles are assigned randomly by a computer. The market will open 
seven times in total. Market members and their roles will remain constant throughout  the 
experiment.  
 
Role of seller:  
Please note that the item is imaginary. Selling the item incurs a certain cost on the seller. The 
selling cost of the item will be assigned randomly in each market. You can propose the price 
of the item, presenting the pri ce you want to sell to others in the same group. You can sell 
your item within three minutes. You cannot sell for less than the randomly given selling cost. 
Your final earning in the market will equal the price at which you actually sold the item 
minus the  selling cost. If no buyer buys your item, you earn nothing.  
 
Example 1 -1 
When seller has a cost of KRW 2000. He sold his item at the price of KRW 18000. Then his 
profit in this market is KRW 16000.  
 
Example 1 -2 
When seller has a cost of KRW 6000. He did not sell item. Then his profit in this market is 
KRW 0.  
 
Role of buyer:  
For buyer, the item has a value. The value will be assigned a randomly generated value at the 
time of market opening. You can buy the item how much you will pay for the item, prese nt 
your bid to others, and can buy the item within three minutes. You cannot buy at a higher 
price than the value you have. Your final earning will equal your purchase value minus the 
price at which you actually bought the item. If you did not manage to bu y the item, you earn 
nothing.  
Example 2 -1 
When buyer has a value of KRW 25000. He bought his item at the price of KRW 14000. 
Then his profit in this market is KRW 11000.   
Example 2 -2 
When buyer has a value of KRW 17000. He did not buy the item. Then his pr ofit in this 
market is KRW 0.  
 
Transaction:  
The market will open seven (7) times excluding the two (2) practice openings. Each market 
opening lasts three (3) minutes (180 seconds). You can make a transaction within three (3) 
minutes in order to earn money.  Once you make a transaction, you cannot make any more 
transactions in the remaining time.  
 
Earnings in Part 1:  
The amount of money you earned in each market opening will be presented at the end of each 
market. Your total earnings from market transactions  will be determined by randomly 
drawing the results of two out of seven market.  
 
Structure of the screen:  
Figure 1 shows the screen shot for the screen you play. Please follow the number and check 
functions of buttons. As we noted, there are 2 practice mar kets for your understanding of the 
game.  
 
1. Your role as either a seller or a buyer will be displayed publicly.  
2. The bids of all the buyers in your market will be displayed publicly.  
3. The prices set by all the sellers in your market will be displayed publicly.  
4. The list of completed transactions in your market will be displayed publicly. Four 
sets of sellers and buyers get to transact one -to-one. 
5. The remaining time is displayed at the top of the screen. You cannot make a tran
saction if you fail to do so within the allotted time.  
6. Among the bids from different buyers, click on the one that you wish to trade for.
 The bids will be listed in descending order of price.  
  
Figure A.1. Decision screen  
 
We will now begin the two practice markets and following s even actual markets. As we 
noted, your final earnings from market transactions will be determined by randomly drawing 
the results of two out of seven market openings.  
 
We remind you again the 5 important information  in Part 1.  
1. First of all, confirm your ro le (seller or buyer) and corresponding given value or 
cost. Your role during practice will remain unchanged throughout the actual experi
ment.  
2. There are four 4 sellers and four 4 buyers in your market.  
3. Each market remains open for three minutes (180 seconds ). You cannot take part 
in any transactions after the market closes.  
4. You may not be able to make a transaction with some probability. You won’t be 
able to make a transaction if you are left with a seller with a higher selling cost 
than your purchase value,  or a buyer with a lower purchase value than your sellin
g cost.  
5. Both the seller and the buyer will be excluded from the market once they have m
ade a transaction. Once you complete a transaction, you will no longer be able to 
participate in the market. Thos e who already completed their transactions will be 
out from the market while the rest continues to transact in the market.  Part II.  
In the second stage of the experiment, your role will be remained same in Part 1. However, in 
a market th ere are one seller and one buyer.  
 
Formation of market  
You will be matched randomly whom you are matched in a same group in Part 1. In a market 
with both buyer and seller, the seller and buyer will earn money by selling or buying an 
imaginary item to the other. The market will open three times in total.  
 
Role of seller:  
Please note that the item is imaginary. Selling the item incurs a certain cost on the seller. The 
selling cost of the item will be assigned randomly in each market. You can propose the price 
of the item, presenting the price you want to sell. You can sell your item within 90 seconds. 
You cannot sell for less than the randomly given selling cost. Your final earning in the 
market will equal the price at which you actually sold the item minus the selling cost. If no 
buyer buys your item, you earn nothing.  
 
Role of buyer:  
For buyer, the item has a value. The value will be assigned a randomly generated value at the 
time of market opening. You can buy the item how much you will pay for the item, present 
your bid to the seller, and can buy the item within 90 seconds. You cannot buy at a higher 
price than the value you have. Your final earning will equal your purchase value minus the 
price at which you actually bought the item. If you did not manage to buy the item, you earn 
nothing.  
 
Transaction:  
Different from Part 1, the transaction can happen in any case which means the cost of the 
seller is always lower than the value of the buyer. Each market opening lasts 90 seconds. 
Once you mak e a transaction, you cannot make any more transactions in the remaining time.  
 
Earnings in Part 2:  
The amount of money you earned in each market opening will be presented at the end of each 
market. Your total earnings from market transactions will be deter mined by randomly 
drawing the results of one out of three market.  
 
 
We remind you again the 4 important information  in Part 2.  
1. Your role (seller or buyer) in Part 2 will remain unchanged and same with Part 1
. 
2. You will be randomly matched the one who belong s to the same group in Part 1.  3. The cost of seller is always lower than the value of buyer which means that trans
action could be happen.  
4. The market will be opened for 90 seconds. 1 
 Part III.  
During this experiment you will see two lotteries , named Lottery L (left) and Lottery R 
(right), on the top of each page. You can choose the lottery what you want between L and R. 
If you choose Lottery L, then you can get KRW 8000 with some probability. Otherwise, 
KRW 0. If you choose Lottery R, then you  can get a certain amount of money which is less 
than KRW 8000. There are 40 pairs of questions in total. Therefore, you will make a decision 
for a question after you compare the two lotteries.  
 
Probability:  
There are five variations in probability: 5%, 2 5%, 50%, 75%, 95%. You should imagine that, 
there are 100 balls in the black box. The balls should be red or blue. When you draw a ball 
from the box, you can earn 8000 KRW when the ball is blue ball. If the ball is red ball, you 
can earn nothing.  
 The conc ept of 5% for the winning KRW 8000 means that you draw a ball from 
black box where 5 blue balls and 95 red balls exist in the black box.  
 
 
 
 
 The concept of 25% for the winning KRW 8000 means that you draw a ball from 
black box where 25 blue balls and 75 red balls exist in the black box.  
2 
  
 The concept of 50% for the winning KRW 8000 means that you draw a ball from 
black box where 50 blue balls and 50 red balls exist in the black box.  
 
 The concept of 75% for the winning KRW 8000 means that you draw a ball from 
black box where 75 blue balls and 25 red balls exist in the black box.  
 
 
 The concept of 95% for the winning KRW 8000 means that you draw a ball from 
black box where 95 blue balls and 5 red balls exist in the black box.  
3 
  
 
Earnings in Part 3:  
One out forty question will be randomly selected after you finish the experiment. Depending 
on your choice of that question. If you chose Lottery L in the selected question, the computer 
will draw a lottery and will let you know the amount of money you wil l get in this part. If you 
chose Lottery R in the selected question, you can get the certain amount.

 Online Appendix A. 2. Implicit Association Test  
 
From now on, you participate in a sorting task. There are figures and words which belong to 
NK or SK.  These are possible figures you will see  in the sorting task . 
. 
 
 
 
 
These are the set of words you will see in the sorting task.  
 
 
 
 
When you participate in the sorting game, there is a condition on the top of the screen. The 
condition is a combination of North Korea/South Korea or Good/Bad.  
 
There will be a figure or a word in the center of the screen, so please sort this figure or wo rd 
whether it is consistent with the condition or not.

 When doing a sorting task you are asked to quickly report the word or figure is consistent or 
inconsistent with the condition. If you think the word or figure is consistent, then click “i” 
key if it is  inconsistent please click “e” key.  
 
For example, in the below case, the condition is “Good or North Korea”. The figure is North

Score.  
 
We use the following restrictions  when we construct IAT score. Each individual has 80 
response time and whether the answer is correct or not.  
 
1. Remove sorting task faster than 10 milliseconds  
2. Remove first four tasks of each response block  
3. Recode <400 ms to 400 ms and >2000 ms to 2000 ms  
4. Compute IAT score  separately for each pair of two consecutive blocks separately and then 
average  
5. Remove block  with more than 10% fast responses  
6. Remove block with more than 30% of wrong answers.

Online Appendix C. 1. Basic Demographics  
 
In this section,  we first compare  basic  demographics of NK and SK . Below Table shows the 
demographics of NK and SK samples . Table  C.1 shows the basic demographic characteristics 
of our subjects. As explained, we recruited SK natives to match the age and gender composition 
of NK refugees. Therefore, between NK and SK subjects, age and gender are well balanced. 
The average age is 39 and the proportion of female participants is about 70% in both groups.  
We note that a ccording to official statistics for the population of NK refugees in SK, NK 
refugees are predominantly females. However, we find that household income is much higher 
among South Koreans. It is not surprising that North Koreans economically underperform, in 
part because a major part of their human capital obtained in NK is obsolete in SK. In addition, 
SK subjects are more educated than NK subjects, although it is hard to compare two countries 
directly in terms of education because their education systems are fundamentally different. 
However, note that we do not attempt to compare NK and SK subjects in the current study but 
exploit the variation within NK subjects in terms of ideological bias. Ther efore, the differences 
between NK and SK subjects are not serious concerns in the current study.  We also report 
various experience in NK  for NK subjects.

 Online Appendix C. 2. Balance test  
 
As we mentioned, NK is divided into two groups: one with NK only market and the other one 
with mix market. Table C.2 tests the balance of our NK samples in each market. We note that  
our NK sample in NK only market  are on average 2 years  younger compared to Mix market 
NK and this difference is significant at 5% level . Except for the age  variable , other 
demographics  are not significantly different at the 5% level  which shows our sample is well -
balanced  between markets.  Especially, we note that our IAT score is not significantly different 
between the market structure.  Fig C.2. shows  the distribution of age in each market .

Online Appendix C. 3. Explicit Attitudes  
 
In this section,  we explain how we construct our explicit attitudes measures.  For the preference 
of market economy we had following Liker scale survey questions (i) performance based 
incentives, (ii) market rules, (iii) private ownership, (iv) market competitions.  As for 
performance -based incentives, the following question is presented: “One should be paid a 
higher wage than another, if the former works better than the latter, even though they are of the 
same age and same rank in the same company." The n, as for market rules, we use the sentence 
“Capitalism is a system that deems any means justifiable as long as it makes more money." 
Regarding private ownership, we present subjects “It is better for the state rather than 
individuals to own firms, lands, residences, etc." Finally, about the market competition, we 
presented two questions: “Competition among individuals is necessary for economic 
development" and “It is more convenient to live in a collectivist society without competition."  
The range of each Liker scale question  is from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree) . The 
preference for market is the sum of these questions.  
We also ask questions about five different aspects of democracy —--(i) the multi -party 
political system, (ii) freedom to  vote, (iii) individualism (vs. collectivism), (iv) anti -strong 
political leader, and (v) human equality.  The question for the multiparty system is “Multiple 
political parties are necessary to aggregate diverse opinions. ” Regarding freedom of voting, the 
following two questions are asked: “national leaders should be selected among multiple 
candidates by people's free will ” and “I make my own voting decision rather than following 
others opinions. ” As for individualism, “One's liberty can be sacrificed for the benefit of the 
whole ” asked.  The question for anti -strong political leaders is “A strong leader is necessary 
for national development. ”. Lastly, the question for human equality is “ man should be treated 
equally regard less of his income, place of origin, educational attainment, ethnicity, or 
nationality. ” Again, we use the Likert scale ranges from 1 to 5 in each questions an d summing 
up to construct the measure.   Online Appendix C. 4. Human Capital Measurement  
 
In this section, we summarize  our human capital  measurement . First, we measure  cognitive 
and non -cognitive skil ls. Second,  we also measure individual differences in economic 
knowledge and skills, we conduct simple ECON 101 and financial literacy tests to measure 
each subject's level of knowledge about a market economy. In the ECON 101 test, we basically 
test whether they understand how changes in supply and demand affect the market price using 
seven questions. For example, one question is as follows: ``Wou ld the market price increase as 
demand increases in the market?" These questions are designed to test whether they have basic 
knowledge about the market's price -adjustment mechanism. The financial literacy test is 
designed to test whether they understand t he basic concepts of the interest rate, economic 
growth, and returns from savings.  
Table C.4. shows the results for human capital measurement.  We find that there is a 
large difference in cognitive ability between NK and SK subjects. It is beyond the scope of the 
current study to account for the difference, but the cognitive gap might exist because North 
Korean subjects experienced nutritional insufficiency in their childhood or their early life 
conditions were not favorable. Unlike the case of cognitive abi lity, all the measures of non -
cognitive skills are not significantly different at the  5% level.

We also report  the same analysis  for SK samples.  We found that t he target profit  of 
SK sample  is significantly correlated with actual profit in panel (a) . However, unlike from NK 
sample, the correlation between IAT and target profit is not significant in most of markets.

Online Appendix C. 6. Other Possible Mechanisms   
 
In this section, we discuss other possible mechanisms for lower profits.  We construct  two 
different measures  regardin g active participation in the market : 1) Passivity and 2) a number  
of bids .  
The first measure is about passive participation in the market. As a measure of a 
subject's passivity in trading, we simply define an indicator of whether the subject never 
submits any bid in a particular round. We first show  that subjects who passively pa rticipate in 
the market have a lower level of profits. We note that we use the same set of controls as in the 
main text.  In Table C.6.1., every specification is significant at 1% level which shows that 
passive participation is very important to explain the  lower level of profits among  NK refugees.

clustered by individual, are presented in parentheses. */**/*** represent significance level 10/5/1 \%. Group - and 
round -specific fixed effects are included in every specification. Basic controls include gender, ag e, age squared, 
and marital status. Preference controls include seller dummy, buyer's given value and seller's given cost, and risk 
preferences (average CE). Human capital control variables include standardized raven score, econ 101 test, 
financial literac y, and Big 5 personality measures. The variables of experiences in NK include lower economic 
class in NK, education level in NK, informal market experience, military service, communist party member, 
regions from bordering with China, and regions from Pyoun gyang or Gaesung (big cities in NK). The variables 
about adaptation in SK include log income in SK, qualify of life in SK and whether they have family members 
left in NK.  
 
We now investigate the effect of IAT on this passivity measure. In Fig C.6.1.  most o f 
the coefficients of IAT are positively correlated with passive participation  which implies IAT 
could lower profits through passive market participation.   
Fig C.6.1. IAT and Passive participation  
 
 The second measure is the number of bids and market profits. It is not clear that there 
is a linear relationship between the number of bids and market profits. For instance, subjects 
left behind with no deal can do a lot of bidding for the rest of the time . Therefore, we first run 
a regression using the number of bids and the squared number of bids as control variables.

left in NK.  
 
Using the coefficient in column (3), w e find that there is a non -linear effect and the 
optimal number  of bids is 2.8. We then construct a variable measuring the absolute gap from 
this optimal number of bids. Then we run a regression using IAT on this absolute gap from the 
optimal number of bids. We again find that as IAT increases, across markets the gap 
significantly increases in most of the markets in Fig C.6.2.  This result shows that a number of 
bids could also be a  possible mechanism that IAT lowers NK refugees’ profit.

Online Appendix C. 7. Robustness Check: Motivation  
 
It is possible that the variation of market earnings in the experiment may reflect differences in 
motivation or preferences regarding effort provision in the artificial environment of the 
experiment. As a robustness check for our main results, we replicate our main Table 2 with two 
different additional controls: 1) the number of biddings and 2) passivity in the market. The 
passivity variable is a binary variable and 1 if subjects do not bid at all, while 0 if subjects bid 
at least more than once. We find that Table 2 is replicated in a robust way even after we control 
possible motivation issues in the experiment.

 Online Appendix D. Institutional  Background  
 
We introduce the  institutional background about North and South Korea . Following the 
separation of the two Koreas, North Koreans have been subject to political education, instilling 
a socialist ideology. In contrast to capitalism based on private ownership and market 
coordination, socialism hinges on collective ownership of p roductive assets and coordination 
through central planning. These socialist premises of following instructions by central planners 
without claiming individual ownership require a mindset different from one in a market 
economy. The essence of such a sociali st mindset is cooperation among economic agents. NK 
is not an exception, emphasizing collectivism and cooperation but perhaps with a stronger 
emphasis on these than any other socialist states (Oh and Hassig, 2004) . 
NK’s official ideology is Juche, which is  literally translated to “we-centeredness. ” 
Although the primary purpose of such an ideology is to enhance the pride of North Koreans as 
a unique socialist state and thus to justify a strong dictatorship ruled by one family, it also acts 
as a guiding princ iple in educating people and managing enterprises. “All for one and one for 
all” derived from the Juche  ideology is a catch phrase that all North Koreans are expected to 
be aware of and behave in accordance with. Such an emphasis on collectivism is found i n 
nearly all of the speeches of political leaders and in official documents. For example, Kim Il -
sung, who is the founding father and the first political leader of NK, gave the following speech 
at a nursery school in 1966: “To become a communist, one shoul d give up selfishness. … A 
communist must cherish the interests of a community and the society not her own interest.” 
(Kim, 2001 ). In line with this ideology, an influential economics journal in NK attempts to 
elaborate the advantage of collectivism agains t capitalism with the following arguments ( Ham, 
1998 ): “If a man who is a member of community pursues money -making at a workplace with 
the motive of self -interest, not only the conflicts of interests among people take place but also 
unity and cooperation a re destroyed.” “In capitalism, men become vulgarians caring only for 
money and the society reduces to a jungle of competition where only the strongest survive.” 
“A society in which people help each other and live as a member of a big family is … a socialis t 
state.”   
To inculcate the socialist mindset in North Koreans, the NK authorities implemented 
a comprehensive system of ideological indoctrination. First, all North Koreans need to be 
members of official organizations whose objectives involve the teachin g of the Juche  ideology. Children in the second year of elementary school and young people at the age of fourteen 
become members of the Boys’ Union and Youth Union, respectively. Unions for adults are 
classified by occupations and all workers are affiliate d with one of the unions. Adults without 
jobs are not exempt from a membership of an organization: housewives must belong to the 
Democratic Women’s Union.  
Second, all North Koreans are obliged to participate in weekly indoctrination meetings 
organized mai nly by the above associations. During these meetings, participants are required 
to provide criticism of both themselves and of other participants using the supreme leaders’ 
instructions as the absolute reference for correct attitude and behavior. In other words, such 
meetings aim to make North Koreans comply with the laws and regulations of the regime 
through both self -awareness and mutual surveillance.  
Third, there are several other methods used to teach and discuss the instructions of 
political leaders and authorities . Families are encouraged to read such instructions at home, 
although that is often difficult to fully enforce. Workers are also required to read and discuss 
them before the start of work. In addition, many North Koreans visit places that fun ction 
primarily as sites for the proliferation of propaganda. NK’s labor law emphasizes the 
importance of learning the political ideology by stating “the principle of eight hours’ work, 
eight hours’ rest, and eight hours’ learning should be fully enforced. ”   
There is some evidence that North Koreans are affected by such programs of 
ideological indoctrination. According to the survey of NK refugees who newly arrived in SK 
in 2014, 54% replied that fellow North Koreans attended at least 70% of the indoctrina tion 
meetings ( Jeong , 2015 ). Such rate of attendances might have been higher during the period 
before the 1990s, when NK began to experience a severe economic crisis. Furthermore, the 
same survey suggests that the average share of North Koreans who are pro ud of the Juche  
ideology amounted to 57% of total population. It is our key question in this study whether such 
intensive ideological indoctrination affects the mindset and the behavior of North Koreans.
