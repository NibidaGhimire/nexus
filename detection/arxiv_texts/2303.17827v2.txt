A quantitative central limit theorem for
Poisson horospheres in high dimensions
Zakhar Kabluchko∗Daniel Rosen†Christoph Th¨ ale‡
Abstract
Consider a stationary Poisson process of horospheres in a d-dimensional hyperbolic space. In
the focus of this note is the total surface area these random horospheres induce in a sequence
of balls of growing radius R. The main result is a quantitative, non-standard central limit
theorem for these random variables as the radius Rof the balls and the spatial dimension d
tend to infinity simultaneously.

1 Introduction and main result
The study of random geometric systems in non-Euclidean geometries is a recent and fast growing
branch of stochastic geometry. We refer to [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 17 ] for selected works
on hyperbolic random geometric graphs, random tessellations and random polytopes.
In this note we address an interesting generalization of the Poisson hyperplane process to
hyperbolic geometry. The study of Euclidean Poisson hyperplanes is by now classical [ 11, 16,
18, 21 ] and was extended in [ 12] to hyperbolic space, where Poisson processes of totally geodesic
hypersurfaces are studied, see also [ 20] for mean values in the planar case. Even more recently,
in [13] it was observed that this model fits into a one-parameter family of so-called Poisson λ-
geodesic hyperplanes , and the fluctuations of the total hyperbolic surface area of such a process
within a sequence of growing balls were examined in detail. The special case we consider here is
thePoisson horosphere process , which corresponds to the choice λ= 1 in [ 13]. In that paper it
was shown that, in contrast with other choices of λ∈[0,1), these fluctuations are Gaussian in all
spatial dimensions. The purpose of the present note is to quantify this result and to extend it to
the setting of growing dimension.
Let us recall some definitions; for more details we refer the reader to [ 13] and the references
cited therein. A horosphere in ad-dimensional hyperbolic space Hdis, intuitively speaking, a
sphere of infinite radius. More formally, it is a complete totally umbilic hypersurface of constant
normal curvature 1. For concreteness, in the Poincar´ e ball model of hyperbolic space, horospheres
are realized as Euclidean spheres tangent to the boundary, see Figure 1. We denote by Hthe
space of all horospheres in Hd. This space admits a transitive action by the group of hyperbolic
isometries and an invariant measure for this action, which is unique up to a multiplicative constant
and will be denoted by Λ, see [ 8, 23 ].
Now, let ηdbe a Poisson process on Hwith intensity measure Λ, see Figure 1 for a simulation
in the case d= 2. For R >0, we consider the total surface area

Raround an arbitrary but fixed point in Hdand having hyperbolic
radius R >0. Here, Hd−1stands for the ( d−1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure with respect to
the hyperbolic metric. In [ 13] it was proven that, for a fixed spatial dimension d, the centred
and normalized surface area satisfies a non-standard central limit theorem. Namely, it converges
in distribution, as R→ ∞ and after centering and normalizing by the standard deviation, to a
Gaussian random variable of variance1
2. The main result of the present note extends this in two
directions: first, we provide estimates on the rate of convergence. Second, our bounds depend
explicitly on the dimension, providing central limit theorems for Poisson horospheres in increasing
spatial dimensions. To measure the distance between two random variables XandYwe use the
Kolmogorov and Wasserstein metrics, which are defined, respectively, by
dKol(X, Y) := sup
t∈R|P(X≤t)−P(Y≤t)|
and
dWass(X, Y) := sup
hE[h(X)]−E[h(Y)],
where the latter supremum is taken over all Lipschitz functions h:R→Rwith Lipschitz constant
at most one.
Our main result is the following non-standard quantitative central limit theorem.
Theorem 1. LetN1
2be a centred Gaussian random variable of variance1
2. Consider the surface
functional SR,d, for d≥2andR≥1. Then there exists a universal constant C >0such that for
any choice • ∈ { Kol,Wass}one has
d• 
SR,d−ESR,dpVarSR,d, N 1
2!
≤C·(
e−R/2:R−logd≤1,
1√
d(R−logd)+1
d√R−logd:R−logd >1.
Remark 2. (i) We first point out that in a fixed spatial dimension d≥2, Theorem 1 implies
the following bound:
d• 
SR,d−ESR,dpVarSR,d, N 1
2!
≤CdR−1/2,
with a constant Cddepending only on d.
We note that the rate of convergence R−1/2is the same in all dimensions. The same
2convergence rate, in all dimensions, is observed in the central limit theorem for the total
surface area of Poisson hyperplanes in Euclidean space (see [ 16], but the result is also a
special case of (1) below). Let us remark that this limiting behaviour is in sharp contrast
with the cases of λ-geodesic hyperplanes with λ <1 (we recall that horospheres correspond
toλ= 1). As described in [ 13], in those cases the fluctuations of the surface functional
are non-Gaussian in every fixed dimension ≥4. The geometric distinction between the two
cases is that horospheres are intrinsically Euclidean , while the intrinsic geometry of other
λ-geodesic hyperplanes is hyperbolic.
(ii) The threshold between the two cases in Theorem 1 is somewhat arbitrary. The constant
1 can be replaced by any positive number, at the cost of changing the constant Cin the
theorem.
(iii) We note that the convergence rate in the first case of Theorem 1 is always worse than d−1/2
(and in particular, worse than in the second case). Indeed, by assumption, eR≤e dand
hence e−R/2converges to zero slower than d−1/2.
(iv) In the high-dimensional regime, that is if d→ ∞ andR=Rdis a sequence of radii, we note
that Theorem 1 implies a non-standard central limit theorem for the surface functional as
soon as Rd− − − →
d→∞∞. For example, taking the radius as R=Rd=αlogdforα >0, the
theorem gives
d• 
SR,d−ESR,dpVarSR,d, N 1
2!
≤C·(
d−α/2:α≤1
d−1/2(logd)−1:α >1.
It is also natural to ask for sharp conditions on Rdwhich ensure that the centred and
normalized total surface area is asymptotically Gaussian. As noted above, Rd→ ∞ is
sufficient, but for fixed Rour bounds do not yield a central limit theorem for the surface
functional. We have to leave this as an open problem.
(v) The reader might be interested in a comparison with the Euclidean case, where one considers
the total surface area SR,d,e of a stationary and isotropic Poisson process on the space of
hyperplanes in Rdwithin a centred ball of radius R. In this situation it holds that
d•SR,d,e−ESR,d,epVarSR,d,e, N
≤C d1/4R−1/2(1)
for some absolute constant C > 0 and where Ndenotes a standard Gaussian random
variable. Since we could not locate this result in the literature, we provide an argument in
Section 4. In particular, as d→ ∞ we need that Rgrows faster than√
din order to deduce
from (1) a central limit theorem.
2 Proof of the main results
Before proving Theorem 1, we need to recall some preliminaries. First we need an explicit
description of the invariant measure Λ on the space Hof horospheres. We fix an origin o∈Hd
and parametrize an element H∈ H by the pair ( s, u)∈R×Sd−1, where s∈Ris the signed
distance from Htoo(with s >0 ifolies on the convex side of H, and negative otherwise), and
u∈Sd−1is the unit vector (in the tangent space ToHd) along the geodesic passing through oand
intersecting Horthogonally, while pointing outside of the convex side. The invariant measure is
then defined by the relation
Z
Hf(H) Λ(d H) =Z
RZ
Sd−1f(H(s, u))e−(d−1)sduds, (2)
3where f:H →Ris a non-negative measurable function and H(s, u) stands for the unique element
ofHparametrized by ( s, u) as just described. Here d sand d ustand for the Lebesgue measure
onRand the normalized spherical Lebesgue measure on Sd−1, respectively.
We will also need the following geometric computation of the volume of the intersection
H(s)∩Bd
R, where H(s)⊂Hdis a horosphere of signed distance s∈Rfrom the origin o. Observe
that this notation is justified by rotational symmetry around o. In [ 13, Proposition 4.1] it is
proven that this intersection is empty for |s| ≥R, and otherwise satisfies
Hd−1(H(s)∩Bd
R) =κd−1
2es(cosh R−coshs)d−1
2, (3)
where for an integer ℓ≥1 we write κℓfor the volume of the ℓ-dimensional Euclidean unit ball.
We also mention some elementary properties of the Kolmogorov and Wasserstein metric that
will be useful for us. First, for any random variables XandY, and scalars α >0 one has
dWass(αX, αY ) =α dWass(X, Y),
dKol(αX, αY ) =dKol(X, Y).(4)
Moreover, given independent random variables XandYas well as another random variable Z
with density bounded by 1, one has
d•(X+Y, Z)≤d•(X, Z) +E|Y|. (5)
For the Wasserstein metric this follows at once from the triangle inequality and the fact that the
Wasserstein metric is bounded by the L1-metric (and, indeed, holds without the independence and
bounded density assumption). For the Kolmogorov metric this is a consequence of the following
result.
Lemma 3. LetXandYbe two independent random variables, and let Zbe another random
variable admitting a bounded density fZ. Then
dKol(X+Y, Z)≤dKol(X, Z) +∥fZ∥∞·E|Y|.
Proof. We write FWfor the cumulative distribution function of the random variable W. For any
t∈Rone has, using independence in the second step,
|P(X+Y≤t)−P(Z≤t)|=|E[P(X≤t−Y|Y)]−P(Z≤t)|
≤ |E[FX(t−Y)−FZ(t−Y)]|+|E[FZ(t)−FZ(t−Y)]|
≤dKol(X, Z) +∥fZ∥∞·E|Y|.
Taking the supremum over t∈Ryields the result.
Remark 4. As is evident from the proof, the assumption that Zhas density may be removed,
in which case the result takes the form
dKol(X+Y, Z)≤dKol(X, Z) +E[ωZ(|Y|)],
where ωZdenotes the modulus of continuity of FZ, that is, ωZ(ε) := supt∈RP(t < Z ≤t+ε).
A first step in the proof of our main result is to reduce the normal approximation bound to
the following integral estimate. Define
JR,d:=ZR

for some universal constant c∈(0,∞).
Proof. In view of the representation (2) of the invariant measure Λ and the expression (3) for the
intersection volume, we have that
SR,d=X
s∈ξfR(s), (7)
where ξis an inhomogeneous Poisson process on Rwith density s7→e−(d−1)s, and the function
fRis defined by
fR(s) =(

We decompose the random variable SR,dinto a ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ part as follows:
SR,d=S+
R,d+S−
R,d,
where
S+
R,d:=X
s∈ξ
s>0fR(s) and S−
R,d:=X
s∈ξ
s<0fR(s).
Note that from the independence property of Poisson processes it follows that the random vari-
ables S+
R,dandS−
R,dare independent. We then have
SR,d−ESR,dpVarSR,d=S+
R,d−ES+

Observe that

4.1], where we used (2) and (3). We deduce that

To control the first summand in (10), we apply the following normal approximation bound,
which is a special case of general bounds for so-called Poisson U-statistics, see [ 14, Theorem 3.12
and Equation (3.9)] and [ 22, page 112]. Applied to S−
R,d, it states that

If we denote further Cd:= 2(d−1)/2κd−1and define

I2(R) :=ZR
0(cosh R−coshs)d−1ds,
I3(R) :=ZR

then we compute, using (7) and (8), that

Here the expectation and variance are computed with the help of the multivariate Mecke equation,
and the fourth cumulant using [ 16, Corollary 1]. Plugging this into (11) finally gives

which clearly implies the bound (6) and completes the proof.
6Our next task therefore is to estimate JR,d. This is achieved by the following result.
Lemma 6. There exists a constant C >0such that the following holds for any d≥2andR≥1.
JR,d≥C·(eR/2√
d:R−logd≤1,
R−logd:R−logd >1.
Remark 7. As in Theorem 1 (see Remark 2), the threshold 1 between the two cases of Lemma
6 can be replaced by any positive number, in which case the constant Cmay change as well.
We postpone the proof of Lemma 6 until Section 3, and first use it to deduce our main result.
Proof of Theorem 1. The theorem follows upon combining Proposition 5 with the integral estim-
ate provided by Lemma 6. Indeed, in the case R−logd >1, we obtain immediately the bound
asserted by the theorem. In the case R−logd≤1, combining Proposition 5 with the first case
of Lemma 6 gives

.
Since by assumption, eR≤e·d, the first term on the right-hand-side is dominant, leading to the
bound appearing in the corresponding case of the theorem.
3 Bounding JR,d
Here we bound the integral JR,d, which we recall is given by
JR,d=ZR
0
1−coshs−1
coshR−1d−1
ds.
Proof of Lemma 6. First we write, with the help of the hyperbolic identity cosh x−1 = 2 sinh2x
2,
JR,d=ZR
0
1−sinh2(s/2)
sinh2(R/2)d−1
ds. (13)
Next we define
ρ=ρ(R, d) :=sinh(R/2)√
d.
We now proceed with the two cases of the lemma separately.
1. Suppose first that R−logd≤1. In the integral (13) we make the substitution
s= 2 arcsinh( ρx); d s=2ρp
1 +ρ2x2dx,
so that
sinh(s/2)
sinh(R/2)=x√
d.
Note that the assumption R−logd≤1 implies
ρ≤eR/2
2√
d=1

7which altogether yields
JR,d= 2ρZ√

Finally, noting that the latter sequence of integrals converges as d→ ∞ to
Z∞
0e−x2dx√
1 +x2>0,
we deduce that JR,d≥ˆC·ρ=ˆC·sinh(R/2)√
dfor some constant ˆC >0. As R≥1, this implies
thatJR,d≥C·eR/2√
dfor some C >0, as asserted.
2. Consider now the case R−logd >1. Noting that, by definition of ρ,s≤2 arcsinh( ρ) implies
sinh(s/2)
sinh(R/2)≤1√
d, we estimates (13) by
JR,d≥Z2 arcsinh( ρ)
0

earcsinh( ρ).
Now, using the logarithmic representation of the inverse hyperbolic sine

we deduce that
arcsinh( ρ)≥log

Finally, the assumption R−logd≥1 gives
log(1−e−R)≥log
1−1
2e
≥ −R−logd
4,
which implies that
arcsinh( ρ)≥R−logd
4.
This shows that JR,d≥C(R−logd), and completes the proof.
4 The Euclidean case
Letηdbe a stationary and isotropic Poisson process on the space A(d, d−1) of affine hyperplanes
inRdwith intensity 1. Its intensity measure Λ eis then given by
Z
A(d,d−1)f(H) Λe(dH) =Z
RZ
Sd−1f(He(s, u)) duds,
for a non-negative measurable function f:A(d, d−1)→R, where He(s, u) stands for the unique
hyperplane in Rdwith signed distance sfrom oand unit normal vector u. As above, d sand d u
stand for the Lebesgue measure on Rand the normalized spherical Lebesgue measure on Sd−1,
respectively. By
SR,d,e:=X

8we denote the total surface area induced by the hyperplanes of ηdwithin a centred Euclidean
ballBd
R,eof radius R >0, where the Hausdorff measure Hd−1
eis understood with respect to the
Euclidean metric. Using, as above [ 14, Theorem 3.12 and Equation (3.9)] and [ 22, page 112] we
find that
