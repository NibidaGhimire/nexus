Abstract
We showthat therecently proposedequations forholomorphi csector of higher-spintheory
ind= 4, alsoknownaschiral, canbenaturallyextendedtodescri beinteracting symmetric
higher-spin gauge ﬁelds in any dimension. This is achieved w ith the aid of Vasiliev’s oﬀ
shell higher-spin algebra. The latter contains ideal assoc iated to traces that has to be
factored out in order to set the equations on shell. To identi fy the ideal in interactions
we observe the global sp(2) that underlies it to all orders. The sp(2) ﬁeld dependent
generators are found in closed form and appear to be remarkab ly simple. The traceful
higher-spin vertices are analyzed against locality and sho wn to be all-order space-time
spin-local in the gauge sector, as well as spin-local in the W eyl sector. The vertices are
found manifestly in the form of curious integrals over hyper simplices. We also extend to
anydthe earlier observed in d= 4 higher-spin shift symmetry known to be tightly related
to spin-locality.

1 Introduction
The higher-spin (HS) interaction problem [1] dates back to the early papers [2]-[4]. Being
notoriously complicated, it still remains only partially solved. In partic ular, a wealth of no go
arguments [5]-[9] (see also [10], [11] for a more recent account) see mingly preclude nonlinear
HS propagation on the Minkowski space1. A green light was given by the seminal results of
Fradkin and Vasiliev [14], [15], who addressed the problem on the AdSbackground and showed
that some of the HS cubic vertices carry inverse powers of cosmolo gical constant. Ever since the
ﬁeld develops rapidly and has led to many interesting ideas and new res ults (see e.g. [16]-[36]
and [1] for substantial, but still not yet a fully comprehensive bibliogr aphy). One of the central
results in the ﬁeld is the all-order HS generating equations ﬁrst obta ined ind= 4 in [17] and
later on for symmetric bosonic ﬁelds in any din [24].
The AdS/CFT view proposed by Klebanov and Polyakov [21] (see also [22], [23] for closely
related papers) that suggests the correspondence of Vasiliev’s H S theory and the O(N) vector
modelhasaddedapotentiallytestableplaygroundfortheweak-we aktypedualitywithHSﬁelds
in the bulk and free matter ﬁelds on the boundary. This line of though t has been triggered by
GiombiandYinastheydirectlycomputedthethree-pointcorrelatio nfunctionsoftheboundary
theory using the Vasiliev equations [37] conﬁrming the holographic ex pectations. The dual
picture suggests that the bulk theory is supposedly healthy. Ther e are many indications in
favor of this statement including those at quantum level, see e.g., [3 8]-[40].
1See, however, [12], [13] where the ﬂat higher spins have been recen tly reconsidered from the holography
perspective.
2In case the conjecture of [21] is valid2it is natural reconstructing HS theory from e.g. a free
boundary scalar. This way a partiallygauge ﬁxed HS cubic action was s uccessfully found in[41]
and shown to be a perfect match with the corresponding conforma l ﬁeld theory (CFT) indepen-
dent results from the Vasiliev theory [42]-[44]. At quartic order, ho wever, the reconstruction
bumps into the locality problem [45], [46] that basically leads to a lack of c omputational con-
trol over the Noether procedure and to a potentially unveriﬁable ﬁ nal result for the holographic
vertex.
On the HS side the locality issue is present too, though in a diﬀerent fo rm. Namely,
Vasiliev equations are formulated in a way which is invariant under ﬁeld r edeﬁnitions, while
thereconstructionofHSverticesthattheydoamountstosolutio nofacohomologicalproblemof
ﬁxing ﬁeld representatives3in one way or another. Already in [37] the locality problem develops
at the cubic order (quadratic at the level of equations). It has be en partly circumvented by
a smart analytic continuation in spins [37], but is still shown to cause t roubles in the form of
artiﬁcial inﬁnities in [47]. This problem was understood as the cohomolo gical one and solved at
this order in [48] leading to a perfectly local vertex. At the same time this analysis has raised
a concern regarding a systematic reconstruction of HS vertices f rom the Vasiliev equations in
a way compatible with locality, whatever this means.
The locality problem has proven to be a highly complicated one and has r olled out the
ongoingresearchmainlyin d= 4[49]-[60]withanumber ofimportantresults4alreadyobtained.
These include the introduction of concepts of spin-locality and ultra locality, locality theorems
of [49], [55], the manifest form of local interaction vertices at the ﬁr st few orders [50], [54] as
well as the important observation of the limiting star product in [51]. The latter establishes
spin-locality of the holomorphic sector (also known as chiral) of the 4 dtheory to all orders [60],
thus proving the locality conjecture of [49] in this sector. In addit ion, spin-locality itself seems
likely to hinge upon presence of the so-called HS shift symmetry [60], [57]; the physical origin
of which remains to be understood. Its observation was inspired by the earlier result of [49]
known as the structure lemma.
In proving locality of the holomorphic sector, the Vasiliev-type equa tions ind= 4 have
been proposed [60]. Unlike the original Vasiliev equations, the former have no room for both
the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors of HS interactions simu ltaneously. Nevertheless,
their advantage is in that they result in all-order spin-local vertices of the holomorhic theory
eﬀortlessly.5Moreimportantly, theseequations canbestraightforwardlygene ralized todescribe
the interaction of symmetric HS gauge ﬁelds in any dimension using the standard Vasiliev
construction of the oﬀ shell HS algebra [24], as well as to the 3 dspinorial HS systems.
The goal of this paper is to come up with a naturally spin-local HS setu p at least within
the orders where spin-locality is already known or expected. To this end we frame equations
of [60] to (i) describe interacting bosonic HS ﬁelds in ddimensions and (ii) set the stage for
further analysis of locality. Our interest in the generating equation s of [60] is motivated by
2An alternative option proposed in [33] is the boundary dual being a co nformal HS theory rather than vector
model.
3Interestingly, the L∞structures arising within the unfolded approach in HS interactions a ppear to be way
more rigid than the usual Noether perturbations. The former sur vive even beyond locality limitations.
4Some of the developed approaches in this quest were successfully a pplied to HS theories in d= 3 [61].
5In this regard it is worth mentioning papers [58], [59] that propose sp in-local holomorphic vertices too. The
analysis relies on the homological perturbation theory that, howev er, renders uncertainties of the form 0 · ∞,
thus compromising consistency. As the system of [60] has no issues with consistency, it can be used to oﬀer
validity checks of this proposal.
3their somewhat unexpected feature to capture spin-local rathe r than nonlocal HS vertices in an
unforced way. Yet, the structure that controls consistency of the proposed equations is quite
puzzling on its own and extends beyond the realm of application to holo morphic sector of the
4dHS theory.
The ﬁrst problem (i) appears to be quite tractable as it rests on the oscillator realization
of HS algebra developed in [24]. This leads us to the generating equatio ns for the oﬀ shell,
equivalently, unconstrained unfolded equations of nonlinear HS ﬁeld s. The wording ’oﬀ shell’
means that the equations actually describe no ﬁeld dynamics rather provide with a set of
consistency conditions similar to the Bianchi identities of general re lativity.
We then study the oﬀ shell vertices. Interestingly, these turn ou t to be spin-local even
beyond the cubic approximation. Speciﬁcally, we show that the so-c alledcanonical choice of
physical ﬁelds gives rise to all-order ultralocality of the gauge secto r. As has been shown in
[52], ultralocality is equivalent to the standard space-time spin locality . The Weyl sector of the
theory, where, inparticular, thescalar resides isshown tobeall-or derspin-local. The developed
formalism brings HS interaction vertices in their manifest form to any given order. All these
vertices exhibit a curious structure of integrals over n-dimensional hypersimplices with nbeing
the order of perturbations.
Apart from locality, HS vertices feature the shift symmetry trans formation properties. Shift
symmetry actsmost naturallyintheFourierspaceasacertaininvar ianceofvertices undershifts
in ’momenta’ and, as it has been shown recently in [57], goes hand in ha nd with locality being
an intriguing subject for future investigation. In particular, as fo llows from analysis of [60] and
[57], shift symmetry oﬀers a class of ﬁeld redeﬁnitions that respect s spin-locality.
To set our system on shell a quotienting of the trace ideal of the oﬀ shell HS algebra
is required. Generally, this problem can be as complicated as constru cting HS interactions
from scratch. Indeed, to factor out the ideal one has to know its exact deformation due to
interactions. The trace ideal is known to be generated by a certain sp(2) in the case of totally
symmetric ﬁelds [24]. In [24] such sp(2) was found to all orders. Its very existence rests on
the properties of the so-called deformed oscillators that underlie t he original Vasiliev equations.
These generate the required sp(2) via bilinears. The lack of the deformed oscillators in our case
makes on shell reduction challenging. For a reason, which is not immed iately obvious to us,
the required sp(2) is still there to all orders, while the corresponding generators appear to be
remarkably simple as we ﬁnd them to be linear in ﬁelds in a closed form. Th is is one of the
most important results of the present work. Having manifested th e structure of the trace ideal
one can systematically analyze on shell interactions order-by-ord er, which we plan to carry out
elsewhere.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 following [24] we review t he structure of HS
unfolded equations i.e., the spectrum of ﬁelds, higher-spin algebra a nd its oscillator realization.
Then, in 2.1 we specify the recently proposed in [60] HS generating eq uations for the case of
thed-dimensional bosonic HS algebra and lay down their basic properties. Section 3 deals
with unconstrained that is oﬀ shell analysis of HS vertices. We demon strate the locality of the
vertices, provide their manifest form as integrals over hypersimplic es, as well as reveal the shift
symmetry there. Section 4 is all about bringing our generating equa tions on shell. Its central
result is the manifest global sp(2) that generates the trace ideal along with the explicitly given
generators (4.36). We conclude in section 5. The paper is supplemen ted with three appendixes.
42 Unfolding of HS interactions
A powerful approach to HS problem is provided by the unfolded form ulation [63] (see [64], [65]
for a recent development). The spectrum of ﬁelds suitable for des cription of HS symmetric
ﬁelds inddimensions consists of 1-forms and 0-forms. The 1-forms [24]
ωa(s−1),b(n)= dxµωa(s−1),b(n)
µ =•••
••,0≤n≤s−1 (2.1)
are given by the o(d−1,1) two-row Young diagrams
ωa(s−1),ab(n−1)= 0, a,b = 0,...d−1, (2.2)
where as typical in HS literature we denote by one and the same lette r symmetrization over
a group of indices with eq. (2.2) being so the standard Young conditio n. At free level one
imposes the irreducible traceless condition
ωa(s−3)c
c,b(n)= 0. (2.3)
The physical component which contains the usual Fronsdal spin- sﬁeld corresponds to n= 0,
whilen >0 are auxiliary, i.e., they can be expressed in terms of derivatives of t he physical
ﬁeld. Note that for each sthere are ﬁnitely many ω’s. Thus introduced ω’s play the role of
HS potentials generalizing Maxwell potential A=ωfors= 1 and the Lorentz connection ωa,b
along with the frame ﬁeld ea=ωaof the Cartan gravity for s= 2.
The 0-forms
Ca(m),b(s)=•••
••, m≥s (2.4)
having anarbitrarylongﬁrst rowareunboundedforﬁxed s. Them=scomponent corresponds
to the rectangular HS Weyl tensors generalizing Maxwell tensor Fa,b=Ca,bfors= 1 and the
Weyl tensor Cab,cdfors= 2. Components m > sare auxiliary, being expressed roughly via
derivatives of the primary ﬁelds with m=s. Similarly, Cis subject to the Young constraint
Ca(m),ab(s−1)= 0 (2.5)
along with the traceless condition
Ca(m−2)c
c,b(s)= 0. (2.6)
A convenient way to work with the two-row Young tensors was prop osed in [24]. Accordingly,
let us introduce the following commuting variables /vectoryα:=ya
αandyα, whereα= 1,2. The
two-component indices can be associated with an sp(2) algebra. To this end one introduces
the canonical sp(2) form ǫαβ=−ǫβαand its inverse ǫαβǫαγ=δγβand deﬁnes the lowering and
raising index convention, e.g.,
yα=ǫαβyβ, y α=yβǫβα, (2.7)
then the Taylor coeﬃcients of any analytic function f(/vectory,y)aresupplemented with the following
condition: /parenleftbigg
/vectoryα·∂
∂/vectoryβ+yα∂
∂yβ+α↔β/parenrightbigg
f= 0, (2.8)
5which forms the two-row Young diagrams with respect to Lorentz in dicesa,b,.... In other
words, they satisfy conditions like (2.2), but not the traceless con straint (2.3), which has to be
imposed additionally in order to stay with o(d−1,1) irreducible components. Eq. (2.8) has
the transparent meaning of an sp(2) invariance. Indeed, by introducing the standard Moyal
star product
(f∗g)(y,/vectory) =/integraldisplay
f(y+u,/vectory+/vectoru)g(y+v,/vectory+/vectorv)eiuαvα+i/vectoruα/vectorvα, (2.9)
where integration over u,v,/vectoruand/vectorvis assumed, it yields the following commutation relations
[ya
α,yb
β]∗= 2iηabǫαβ,[yα,yβ]∗= 2iǫαβ,[ya
α,yβ]∗= 0. (2.10)
One then ﬁnds that (2.8) can be written down as
[t0
αβ,f(y,/vectory)]∗= 0, t0
αβ=1
4i(ya
αyaβ+yαyβ). (2.11)
Generators t0
αβform the so-called Howe dual algebra to o(d−1,2) spanned by various sp(2)-
invariant bilinears of /vectoryandy
Pa=ya
αyα, Mab=ya
αybα. (2.12)
It is easy to observe sp(2) commutation relations for the generators deﬁned in (2.11)
[t0
αβ,t0
γδ]∗=ǫαγt0
βδ+ǫβγt0
αδ+ǫαδt0
βγ+ǫβδt0
αγ. (2.13)
Having introduced the above formalism, the HS algebra can be const ructed as follows [66].
Consider an associative algebra spanned by various formal power s eries in/vectoryandythat has
product (2.9). This algebra contains a subalgebra Sgenerated by elements that fulﬁl sp(2)
singlet condition (2.11). Algebra Sis not simple since it contains two-sided ideal Iof the form
g=t0
αβ∗fαβ(y,/vectory) =fαβ(y,/vectory)∗t0
αβ∈I, (2.14)
wheregsatisﬁes (2.11) which in practice means that sp(2) indices of fαβshould be carried by
yαand/vectoryα. One can consider the quotient algebra S/Iwhich is still an associative algebra and
then build out of it a Lie algebra by using the Lie bracket as a commutat or. The latter algebra
is the HS algebra in ddimensions.6Treating algebra Sas a linear space one can strip its ideal
oﬀ. This means the following decomposition for general f∈ S
f=f+g, g∈I, (2.15)
where one has to specify any particular way of choosing the repres entative. For the f∈ S/I
choice, its coeﬃcients in Taylor expansion can be chosen to corresp ond to traceless Young
diagrams [e.g., (2.3)].
6This algebra was originally obtained in terms of the enveloping algebra in [62], where higher symmetries of
the massless scalar were studied. The corresponding algebra was c alled conformal higher spin algebra.
6FollowingthestandardHSphilosophy, considernowthe1-form ωand0-form Ctakingvalues
in the oﬀ shell HS algebra. These encode ﬁelds (2.1) and (2.4) in the Ta ylor-like expansion.
The unfolded equations are
dxω+ω∗ω= Υ(ω,ω,C)+Υ(ω,ω,C,C )+... , (2.16)
dxC+ω∗C−C∗π(ω) = Υ(ω,C,C)+Υ(ω,C,C,C )+... , (2.17)
whereπis the reﬂection automorphism
πf(y,/vectory) =f(−y,/vectory) (2.18)
and Υ’s are interaction terms that describe the HS gauge-invariant oﬀ shell ﬁeld identities.
Abusing the terminology we call such vertices ’oﬀ shell’ as opposed to the on shell ones based
on the factor algebra corresponding to dynamical HS interaction. To arrive at the on-shell HS
evolution one has to strip oﬀ the associated sp(2) generated ideal. As mentioned, this problem
can be really complicated due to the fact that Υ’s on the right-hand s ide of (2.16) and (2.17)
are not built out of ﬁeld star products. Instead, the oﬀ shell HS alg ebra gets deformed which
entails the deformation of the ideal. As a result the factorization ca nnot be carried out using
the undeformed prescription (2.15). In other words, generator s of thesp(2) algebra deﬁned in
(2.11) become ﬁeld dependent in the interactions.
2.1 Generating equations
To arrive at eqs. (2.16)-(2.17) we follow [24] and [60]. Namely, using Va siliev’s trick we enhance
the space spanned by Y= (y,/vectory) by introducing the auxiliary two-component7zαand embed
the 1-form ωinto this larger space
ω→W(z;Y) :=ω(Y)+W1(z;Y)+W2(z;Y)+... , (2.19)
whereWnare yet to be deﬁned perturbative in Ccorrections. We call embedding (2.19)
canonical provided
Wn(0,Y) = 0,∀n≥1 (2.20)
which means that the physical ﬁeld representative ω=W(0,Y) is chosen to be ﬁxed and is not
subject to ﬁeld redeﬁnition in the interactions; this would not be the case ifWk(0,Y)/ne}ationslash= 0 for
someinteger k. Toavoidanyconfusionatthispointwewanttostressherethatco nstraint(2.20)
just deﬁnes the way one can solve the generating system rather t han forbids ﬁeld redeﬁnitions.8
We then also enhance the Moyal star product (2.9) to a large z-dependent product [60] (see
also [51])
(f∗g)(z;Y) =/integraldisplay
f(z+u′,y+u;y)⋆g(z−v,y+v+v′;y)exp(iuαvα+iu′
αv′α),(2.21)
where⋆is a part of star product (2.9) that acts on /vectoryonly
(f ⋆g)(/vectory) =/integraldisplay
f(/vectory+/vectoru)g(/vectory+/vectorv)exp(i/vectoruα/vectorvα). (2.22)
7Notice, however, that we do not double variables Y’s unlike [24]. Our choice corresponds to a particular
gauge ﬁxing of St¨ uckelberg ﬁelds along with the conventional choic e for the compensator.
8Similarly, the so-called z-dominated constraints have been imposed (see e.g. [49]) to the ﬁr st few orders in
solving Vasiliev’s generating system to obtain spin-local vertices.
7Notice, the( z,y)ordering in(2.21) diﬀers fromtheoriginal Vasiliev one [24]. For z-independent
functions (2.21) is identical to (2.9). Moreover, (2.21) coincides wit h that of Vasiliev if either
forgisz-independent. The large star product mixes zandyleaving transformation with
respect to /vectoryunaﬀected. A distinguishing property of (2.21) is
[zα,zβ]∗= 0. (2.23)
More generally, one comes along with the following action
y∗=y+i∂
∂y−i∂
∂z, z∗=z+i∂
∂y, (2.24)
∗y=y−i∂
∂y−i∂
∂z,∗z=z+i∂
∂y, (2.25)
/vectory∗=/vectory+i∂
∂/vectory,∗/vectory=/vectory−i∂
∂/vectory. (2.26)
The important element of the star product (2.21) is a “ δ-function”
δ:=eizαyα, f(z)∗δ=δ∗f(z) =δ·f(0). (2.27)
Its square δ∗δ= 0· ∞is ill-deﬁned that along with (2.27) emphasizes an analogy with δ-
function.9
Generating equations that reconstruct right-hand sides of (2.16 ) and (2.17) order-by-order
has the form [60]
dxW+W∗W= 0, (2.28)
dzW+{W,Λ}∗+dxΛ = 0, (2.29)
dxC+(W(z′;y,/vectory)∗C−C∗W(z′;−y,/vectory))/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
z′=−y= 0, (2.30)
whereC=C(y,/vectory|x) isz-independent and Λ is the following d z-form
Λ = dzαzα/integraldisplay1
0dτ τC(−τz,/vectory)eiτzαyα, (2.31)
which satisﬁes
dzΛ =C∗γ, γ =1
2eizydzβdzβdz:= dzα∂
∂zα, (2.32)
where we use the following short hand notation for index contractio n
ξαηα:=ξη=−ηξ. (2.33)
Note that eq. (2.30) unlike (2.28) and (2.29) contains no zand, therefore the star product acts
in eq. (2.30) by ignoring dummy argument z′ofWwhich is set to z′=−yat the end.
9Let us stress that the square of κ= expizyis perfectly well-deﬁned in the Vasiliev ordering, κ∗κ= 1,
[24].
8Consistency. Unlike the original Vasiliev equations, consistency of system (2.28)- (2.30) is
far from being obvious. It rests on the properties of functional c lass that admits evolution on
(2.28)-(2.30) and a particular projective identity (2.36). All necessary details are laid in [60].
Here we brieﬂy sketch the basic steps:
•First, apart from formal consistency it is important to examine whe ther or not star
products of various master ﬁelds in (2.28)-(2.30) exist at all. For ex ample, Λ ∗Λ can be
checked to be ill-deﬁned. To answer that question one searches fo r a class of functions
that respects operations on the generating equations. It turns out that if system (2.28)-
(2.30) has perturbative solutions, then they belong to d z-graded class Cr, whereris the
rank of d z-diﬀerential form (see Appendix A),
Cr1∗Cr2→Cr1+r2, r1+r2<2 (2.34)
dzCr→Cr+1,dxCr→Cr. (2.35)
Correspondingly, W∈C0, Λ∈C1andC∈C0. In [60] it was proven that functions
(A.3) indeed respect requirements (2.34)-(2.35) and result in well-d eﬁned star products
provided r1+r2/ne}ationslash= 2. The following products C0∗C2,C2∗C0andC1∗C1are sick
unlessC0isz-independent. Luckily, there are no ill-deﬁned products in (2.28)-( 2.30). It
was also shown that arbitrary z-independent functions of grading r= 0 do belong to C0,
whileδ∈C2(2.27).
•Now that we have identiﬁed proper functions (A.3), one proves the following projecting
identity [60]. Suppose φ(z,y;/vectory)∈C0is a dx0-form,10then
dz(φ∗Λ) = (φ(z′,y;/vectory)∗C)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
z′=−y∗γ,dz(Λ∗φ) = (C∗φ(z′,−y;/vectory))/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
z′=−y∗γ.(2.36)
In proving (2.36) one needs (A.3) and (2.31). Identity (2.36) was co inedprojective in [60],
since it somehow projected out the dependence on zofφintoδ-element (2.27) stored
inγ. We note also, that while it is tempting to use the Leibniz rule and eq. (2 .32)
in proving (2.36), this would lead to uncertainty because both terms in decomposition
dz(C0∗C1) = dzC0∗C1+C0∗dzC1do not exist separately.11
•Armed with the class (2.34) and (2.35) and identity (2.36) all is set to g uarantee consis-
tency of (2.28)-(2.30). Equation (2.28) is clearly consistent under d2
x= 0. Hitting (2.28)
with d xand substituting d xWfrom (2.28) back one faces no ill-deﬁned objects either.
Now, applying d zto (2.28) and using (2.29) we again ﬁnd neither new constraints nor
ill-deﬁned expressions. Less trivial is to check consistency of (2.29 ) and (2.30). Applying
dzto (2.29) gives the following constraint
dz{W,Λ}∗= dxC∗γ. (2.37)
The problemhere isthatonecannot useLeibniz ruleontheleft of (2.3 7) because product
ofCr1∗Cr2withr1+r2= 2 is ill-deﬁned as noted earlier. Another point is since d xCis
10For space-time diﬀerential forms of higher ranks one should bear in mind{dx,dzα}= 0 that may result in
overall signs in (2.36)
11It is worth to mention that the failure of Leibniz rule oﬀers some free dom in deﬁnition of d zin sector of d z
one-forms in a way that may diﬀer from (2.32). Unfortunate choice might lead to inconsistent vertices, however
the one used in this paper and in [60] is consistent. More details are in [67].
9z-independent by deﬁnition, the z-dependence of the left-hand side of (2.37) must be of
the very speciﬁc form F(Y)∗γ. At this stage identity (2.36) helps. Using it one has
(C∗W(z′;−y,/vectory)−W(z′;y,/vectory)∗C)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
z′=−y∗γ= dxC∗γ, (2.38)
which holds in view of (2.30). Finally, one has to check that (2.30) is con sistent with
d2
x= 0. This is indeed so, because (2.30) comes out as a consequence of (2.29) in the
form of (2.37), which is equivalent to (2.30). The former is manifestly consistent as can
be seen upon applying d xto it and using again (2.28), (2.29). Let us also note in this
regard that (2.30), therefore, is not an independent equation.
Gauge symmetries Equations (2.28)-(2.30) are invariant under the following local gaug e
transformations parameterized by ǫ∈C0
δǫW= dxǫ+[W,ǫ]∗ (2.39)
δǫΛ = d zǫ+[Λ,ǫ]∗, (2.40)
δǫC= (ǫ(z′,y)∗C−C∗ǫ(z′,−y))z′=−y. (2.41)
The above transformations leave (2.28)-(2.30) and (2.32) invarian t, but not yet (2.31). In order
to keep (2.31) intact one has to require
δǫΛ(C) = Λ(δǫC), (2.42)
which is equivalent to
dzǫ+[Λ(C),ǫ]∗−Λ(δǫC) = 0, (2.43)
where the last term in (2.43) is understood as (2.31) with Cbeing replaced by (2.41). Equation
(2.43) is consistent as can be seen upon acting with d zand using (2.36) and, therefore, can be
solved order-by-order using the standard contracting homotop y. Functions ǫ∈C0that satisfy
(2.43) determine true local gauge symmetries of HS generating equ ations (2.28)-(2.30). The
corresponding solution space we label by C0
c, where subscript Cstands for a z-independent
element that Λ depends on. It is easy to see that these functions f orm the Lie algebra. Indeed,
on one hand from (2.40) one ﬁnds
(δǫδη−δηδǫ)Λ = d z[ǫ,η]∗+[Λ,[ǫ,η]∗]∗. (2.44)
On the other hand, from (2.42) it follows δηδǫΛ = Λ(δηδǫC) and so
(δǫδη−δηδǫ)Λ = Λ(( δǫδη−δηδǫ)C), (2.45)
where we have also taken into account that Λ is linear in C
Λ(C1+C2) = Λ(C1)+Λ(C2). (2.46)
Those parameters ǫgl∈C0
cthat leave ﬁelds W, Λ andCinvariant generate global symmetries
δW=δΛ =δC= 0. (2.47)
In this case the corresponding global symmetry parameter satisﬁ es
dxǫgl+[W,ǫgl]∗= 0, (2.48)
dzǫgl+[Λ,ǫgl]∗= 0. (2.49)
Note that δǫglC= 0 comes about as the integrability consequence of (2.49). It also e ntails
validity of (2.43).
10Projectively twisted-adjoint module. The role of projective identity (2.36) is crucial for
consistency (2.28)-(2.30). One of its remarkable properties is it ge nerates a kind of a twisted-
adjoint representation of the large algebra that acts on its module spanned by z-independent
functions from the oﬀ shell HS algebra. Since the module is z-independent, we call it projective .
Speciﬁcally, for a z-independent element C(y,/vectory) and any ǫ∈C0
clet us deﬁne the following
action
ρǫ(C) := (ǫ(z′,y)∗C−C∗ǫ(z′,−y))z′=−y. (2.50)
Recall, that star product in (2.50) is insensitive to z′, which stands idle there and then is set to
−y. One can show that ρforms a representation of the large Lie algebra, as for two such ǫ1,2
we have
(ρǫ1ρǫ2−ρǫ2ρǫ1)C=ρ[ǫ1,ǫ2]∗C. (2.51)
The proof of this fact follows from (2.44). A brief comment in regard of (2.51) is in order.
We can not make a stronger statement than (2.51). Looking at the large algebra as at the
associative one, we could have expected the following map
τǫ(C) := (ǫ(z′,y)∗C)z′=−y (2.52)
to be its representation. However, this is not the case as it is not diﬃ cult to show that
τǫ1τǫ2/ne}ationslash=τǫ1∗ǫ2 (2.53)
forz-dependent ǫ1,2∈C0.
Notice, (2.51) guarantees that local gauge symmetries act prope rly on the Weyl module C
to form an algebra, i.e., δ[ǫ1δǫ2]=δ[ǫ1,ǫ2]∗. It is important also to stress that parameter ǫ(z,Y|x)
isnotan arbitraryanalytic function of zandYbut belongs to a much smaller subset of analytic
functions from C0. Still, the latter class is big enough to capture HS dynamics as it conta ins
all analytic z-independent functions.
3 Oﬀ shell: vertices, locality and shift symmetry
Equations (2.28)-(2.30) generate unconstrained, which is oﬀ shell, HS vertices of (2.16) and
(2.17). The procedure is pretty standard for the Vasiliev-like syst ems. In our case it boils down
to a resolution for z-dependence of ﬁeld Wusing (2.29) and substitution of the result into
(2.28) and (2.30). Equation (2.30) being manifestly z-independent reproduces (2.17). While
z-independence of (2.28) that brings (2.16) is not manifest, it is guar anteed by the fact that
application of d zto the left-hand side of (2.28) is zero provided (2.29) imposed. This m akes
the analysis particularly simple as substitution of any Wthat satisﬁes (2.29) into (2.28) can be
carried out at an arbitrary convenient value of z, e.g., at z= 0. Below we provide all necessary
details. The important conclusion here is the oﬀ shell vertices appea r to be properly local at
any interaction order. Namely, we will show that all Υ( ω,ω,C...C ) are space-time spin-local,
while all Υ( ω,C...C ) are spin-local.
Anotherobservation, whichistightlyrelatedtolocalityistheshiftsy mmetry oftheobtained
vertices. It has been already observed in [60] as a symmetry of the holomorphic on shell HS
vertices in four dimensions. Its eﬀect has been analyzed on genera l grounds within the Vasiliev
theory in d= 4, [57] with a conclusion that if present, it leads to HS spin-locality un der some
mild extra assumptions.
11Contracting homotopy First order in zpartial diﬀerential equation (2.29) determines z-
dependence of the perturbative corrections Wn(z;Y) from (2.19). It brings a freedom in z-
independent functions at each perturbation order. This freedom is naturally interpreted as
ﬁeld redeﬁnition of the physical ﬁeld ω(Y) by higher order in Cterms
ω→ω+F(ω,C...C ). (3.1)
Fieldωmakes its appearance at zeroth order. For reasons that will beco me signiﬁcant upon on-
shell reduction ofHSequations, we stick tothe canonical form(2.2 0)of perturbative corrections
Wnimplying that we set
F(ω,C...C ) = 0. (3.2)
In other words, we ﬁx ﬁeld ωat the very beginning assuming no further ﬁeld redeﬁnitions. This
choice lives up to the standard contracting homotopy as will be clear soon.
Consider the following equation for d z-zero form f(z)
dzf(z) =g(z) := dzαgα(z). (3.3)
It is consistent provided d zg(z) = 0. In this case it can be solved up to a constant as
f(z) = ∆g(z) :=zα/integraldisplay1
0dτ gα(τz). (3.4)
Operator ∆ is referred to as the contracting homotopy operator . Note, that no part of gα(z) of
the form zαφ(z) contributes to the solution for f, since ∆(d zαzαφ(z))≡0 aszαzα= 0. Now,
substituting decomposition (2.19) into (2.29) one ﬁnds
dzWn=−{Wn−1,Λ}∗−(dxΛ)n, W 0:=ω(Y|x). (3.5)
The solution satisfying (2.20) can be then written down as
Wn=−∆{Wn−1,Λ}∗, (3.6)
where (d xΛ)n, being proportional to zα, (2.31) vanishes upon application of ∆. Starting from
physical ω, eq. (3.6) generates any order O(Cn) corrections Wn(z;Y) such, that Wn(0,Y) = 0
in accordance with the canonical embedding (2.20). The correspon ding HS vertices from (2.16)
and (2.17) acquire the following form
Υ(ω,ω,C...C/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
n) =−/parenleftBigg/summationdisplay

n) =−(Wn−1(z′;y,/vectory)∗C−C∗Wn−1(z′;−y,/vectory))/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
z′=−y, (3.8)
where in (3.7) we set z= 0 for convenience as the vertex is z-independent anyway. Since
Wn(0;Y) = 0 for n >0, this choice leads to no contribution from d xWn.
123.1 Vertices
Star product (2.21) is well-suited for exponentials. It is then conve nient to use the Taylor
representation with respect to variable yof our ﬁelds
C(y,/vectory)≡e−ipαyαC(y′,/vectory)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
y′=0,pα=−i∂
∂y′α, (3.9)
ω(y,/vectory)≡e−itαyαω(y′,/vectory)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
y′=0,tα=−i∂
∂y′α, (3.10)
where p acts on C, while t on ω. As the HS vertices, Υ, from (2.16) and (2.17) are strings
of several C’s the number of which depends on the order of perturbations, we e ndow p with
index p kthat points at which Cit acts upon as seen from left. Similarly, in (2.16) where
twoω’s present, we distinguish between t 1and t2. The only star product that one faces in
extracting vertices is the one of the gaussian exponentials. Notice also, that ⋆-product with
respect to /vectory’s stays undeformed in interaction that makes it dummy in practical c alculation.
Therefore, the vertices can be conveniently written down in the ge nerating form using functions
Φ[δ1,δ2](y;t1,2,p1,...,pn) that reproduce various order nvertex contributions via
Υ =/summationdisplay
δ2>δ1Φ[δ1,δ2](y;t1,t2,pi)(C⋆...⋆ω⋆...⋆ω⋆...⋆C )(y′

δΦ[δ](y;t,pi)(C⋆...⋆ω⋆...⋆C )(y′

So, the HS vertices are unambiguously determined via functions Φ, w hich we will call the oﬀ
shell or unconstrained vertices abusing the terminology. We will also ignore the part on which
operators t and p act upon, that is we adopt the following shorthan d notation
ω→e−itαyα, (3.13)
C→e−ipαyα, (3.14)
Λ→dzα/integraldisplay1
0dτ τzαeiτzβ(y+p)β. (3.15)
Using (3.6) it is not diﬃcult to arrive at the manifest expressions for Φ at any order. However,
since these vertices aremere the generalized Bianchi constraints , one has to strip oﬀ the traceful
ideal properly to set them on shell. This problem will be addressed else where, while here we
provide with examples of all order oﬀ shell vertices, as well as spell o ut some properties that in
fact do not rely on their explicit form.

These simple examples above illustrate a few general phenomena typ ical of all orders. Namely:
(i) the exponential part of the vertices never has contractions p i·pj. Moreover, there is no a
single contraction y·piwithin Φ[δ1,δ2]; and (ii) integration over τ’s goes along a simplex. At
higher orders the integration domain includes a peculiar structure o f two hypersimplices. For
example, it is not diﬃcult to extract the following any order vertex ex plicitly

ωC...C(z′;Y)∗C)z′=−y=−W(n)

To do so we need Wto thenthorder. It can be conveniently found using that W∈C0that
makes representation (A.4) particularly useful. The concise form f ollows from the iterative
equation
W(n)=−∆(W(n−1)∗Λ), (3.29)

Note that the integration over λigoes along faces of hypersimplex △n, while the integration
overνigoes across its volume. Note also for n= 1 the integration over λ1trivializes in a sense
thatλ1≡1 as follows from (3.35). The appearance of integrals over hypersim plices might not
be too surprising. A suggestive analogy is the structure of cubic co upling constants for helicities

Vertex Φ n+1is reproduced via (3.28). It carries the structure of the hypersim plex integration
domain just found. Simplicity of the ﬁnal result is noteworthy. All ve rtices including those
15from (3.11) have similar form based on the unique conﬁguration spac e (3.34). For example,
from (3.7) one obtains
Φ[1,2]
n=−W(n)(−t1,y+t1,/vectory)e−iyt1(3.40)
withW(n)(z,y,/vectory;t2,pi) from (3.30). It would be interesting to elaborate more on the geom etric
properties of the obtained integrals.
The resulting vertices feature a particular simple transformation u nder shifts p i→pi+a,
whereais an arbitrary spinor. Speciﬁcally, one observes using (3.33) and (3 .35) that
Bn(pi+a,t) =Bn(pi,t)+a, (3.41)
cn(pi+a,t) =cn(pi+a,t)+(1−rn)at. (3.42)
These relations underlie the so-called shift symmetry of the interac tion vertices, which we
discuss in the next section. Technically, most of the properties disc ussed above are literally
coincide with the analysis from [60], where reader can ﬁnd more details .
3.2 Locality
Spin-locality The problem of locality of the HS interactions in ddimensions boils down
to the analysis of the number of Lorentz index contractions12of various C’s within vertices
Υ(ω,C...C ) and Υ( ω,ω,C...C ). This number can be arbitrarily large even for ﬁxed spins.
Indeed, as the ﬁrst row in (2.4) is unbounded, there can be inﬁnitely many contractions of the
form, for example/summationdisplay
mg(m,s1,s2)Ca(m)...,b(s1)Ca(m)...,b(s2). (3.43)
Whenever this happens the vertex is said to be spin nonlocal. An inﬁnit e length of the ﬁrst row
of (2.4) is supported by inﬁnitely many yα/vectoryαcontracted with it. Therefore, nonlocality can be
rephrased using the language of Φ from (3.11) and (3.12) as a nonpo lynomial dependence on
various contractions p i·pj. So, the vertex is said to be spin-local if Φ contains no nonpolynomial
contractions p ·p [49], [52]. Let us note, that dependence on t ·t and t·p is irrelevant for spin-
locality. This is due to the fact that 1-forms ωbelong to a ﬁnite-dimensional module of the HS
algebra for ﬁxed spin (2.1) as opposed to C, which is inﬁnite dimensional (2.4).
Spin ultralocality Another important concept introduced in [50] is spin ultralocality . Sup-
pose Φ from (3.11) depends on contractions y·pi. If such a dependence is at most polynomial,
then the corresponding vertex is called spin ultralocal . The meaning of this concept is roughly
the following. Imagine (3.11) is spin-local but not ultralocal. This implies that the number of
various contractions is ﬁnite for ﬁxed spins but grows with spin suﬃc iently fast. As explained
in [60], in order for vertices (2.17) to be spin-local (3.11) should be sp in-ultralocal, which means
that Φ[δ1,δ2]must contain no nonpolynomial y·p contractions. These, if present, imply that
while vertex is still spin local, the depth of contractions of ﬁrst rows between various C’s grows
with spins. This ruins spin-locality of (3.12) at the next order in pertu rbation via integrability
condition [60]. In addition, it was shown in [52] in d= 4 that if a vertex is spin-ultralocal, then
it is space-time spin-local in the usual sense.
12Recall, the rectangular Young diagram Ca(s),b(s)corresponds to a spin sWeyl tensor, which is a physical
ﬁeld, while Ca(s+n),b(s)is its descendant made of the derivatives for n >0. The number of these derivatives
grows with n.
16To summarize, (non)locality of the vertex constrained to a ﬁxed se t of spins sidepends
on function Φ. To be spin-nonlocal, Φ must contain at least one nonpo lynomial contractions
pk·pl. This is equivalent to having inﬁnitely many contractions with respect to ﬁrst rows of
twoC’s. Notice, that the presence of star product ⋆in (3.11) and (3.12) that acts on variable
/vectoryyields no such contractions and therefore can not aﬀect locality. T he important property
of equations (2.28)-(2.30) is that the oﬀ shell vertices they gener ate in (2.16) and (2.17) are
naturally spin-ultralocal and spin-local, respectively. Therefore, the problem of the HS locality
on shell resolves into the algebraic one of a proper factorization of the trace ideal. We do not
pursue on shell (non)locality here leaving this analysis for the futur e.
Spin-locality of traceful Υ’s follows literally from the analysis of [60]. Th e only diﬀerence
is one has to replace ¯∗with⋆leaving the rest as is. For details we refer the reader to section
5 in ref.[60]. Here we state the ﬁnal result. Namely, Φ[δ1,δ2]contains neither p ·y, nor p·p
contractions which implies that Υ’s from (2.16) are ultralocal and the refore, according to [52],
arespace-timespin-localatanyorder. Analogously, itfollowsthat Φ[δ]carrynop ·pcontractions
while vertices from (2.17) are spin-local oﬀ shell.
3.3 Shift symmetry
Remarkable property of vertices (3.11) and (3.12) is particularly sim ple transformation laws
under a shift of parameters p iand oscillator y. Speciﬁcally, as was shown in [60] and as is clear
from (3.41), (3.42) the following transformations take place
Φ[δ1,δ2](y−a;t1,t2,pi+a) =ei(t1+t2)αaαΦ[δ1,δ2](y;t1,t2,pi), (3.44)
Φ[δ](y;t,pi+b) =ei(t+y)αbαΦ[δ](y;t,pi), (3.45)
whereaandbare arbitrary spinor parameters. In particular, the above shift t ransformations
leave vertices unaﬀected for aα=µ(t1+t2)αandbα=ν(t+y)αwith arbitrary numbers µand
ν. The proof is based on the transformations (3.41) and (3.42) in the perturbative expansion.
A more detailed derivation can be found in [60].
The symmetry transformations (3.44), (3.45) have been already o bserved in four dimensions
and dubbed shift symmetry . Hence, shift symmetry has a straightforward generalization to a ny
d. This observation is closely related to the earlier analysis of [49], whe re it was shown how
certain parameter shifts of the so-called shifted homotopies redu ce the degree of nonlocality of
HS vertices. While we use no shifted homotopies in our studies, the ide a to look at what shifts
in (3.44), (3.45) might lead up to was to a large extend inspired by the r esult [49]. Since (3.11)
and (3.12) have meaning of the Fourier transformed HS vertices, t he symmetry naturally acts
in the Fourier space. However, its physical interpretation remains unclear. The recent analysis
of [57] has revealed that spin-locality is intimately related to shift sym metry. Given that, it
would be interesting to see whether or not shift symmetry in ddimensions goes through the on
shell factorization.
4 On shell reduction
Equations (2.28)-(2.30) with (2.31) are shown to be consistent. Th ey generate unfolded equa-
tions (2.16) and (2.17). As has been mentioned, the latter describe HS ﬁeld dynamics not until
a proper factorization condition over the tracefull ideal is imposed . Recall, that at the free level
17the ideal is generated by the Howe dual sp(2), (2.14), provided the HS ﬁelds ωandCaresp(2)
singlets
[t0
αβ,C]∗= [t0
αβ,ω]∗= 0, (4.1)
Equation (4.1) guarantees the spectrum to consist of the two-ro w Young diagrams (2.1) and
(2.4), which, however, are not traceless yet. To make them trace less one strips oﬀ the ideal
(2.14). This simply implies a subtraction of traceful components of Y oung diagrams in practice.
Now, nonlinear equations (2.16) and (2.17) that we can denote A1= 0 for 1-forms and
A0= 0 for 0-forms, correspondingly, span two-row Young diagrams a s well and, therefore, one
should have
[A1,t0
αβ]∗= [A0,t0
αβ]∗= 0. (4.2)
A seemingly natural idea is to set equations A0,1on-shell by assuming ﬁelds ωandCprop-
erly traceless and then by dropping terms associated with tracefu l contributions of the form
t0
αβ∗Aαβ=Aαβ∗t0
αβ, whereAαβare chosen in such a way, so as to make e.g., eq. (2.16) totally
traceless. The procedure just prescribed however does not lead to consistent interaction, be-
cause in adding terms from the ideal one has to make sure that the r esulting equations remain
consistent up to terms from the same ideal. For the ideal in question this is not granted in
interactions since the oﬀ shell HS algebra along with its ideal get defo rmed. In other words,
the corresponding Howe dual sp(2) generators (2.11) receive ﬁeld-dependent corrections
tαβ=t0
αβ+O(C). (4.3)
So, the problem that one would like to address is whether there still e xists an algebra spanned
by (possibly) ﬁeld-dependent generators that satisfy commutat ion relations (2.13)
[tαβ,tγδ]∗=ǫαγtβδ+ǫβγtαδ+ǫαδtβγ+ǫβδtαγ, (4.4)
and that allows for a consistent truncation of the associated trac e ideal at the level of the
nonlinear equations (2.16) and (2.17).
4.1 Global sp(2)and the quotienting
The described problem can be solved systematically if it is noted that t he singlet condition
(2.11) can be viewed as a requirement of existence of the global sym metrysp(2) at the level
of the oﬀ shell equations. While deformed, it should still be there in int eractions to guarantee
proper degrees of freedom. Once generating system (2.28)-(2.3 0) reproduces (2.16)-(2.17), we
require the sp(2) to be its global symmetry,
δtW=δtΛ =δtC= 0. (4.5)
Using explicit (2.39)-(2.41) one ﬁnds the corresponding generator stαβsatisfy
dxtαβ+[W,tαβ]∗= 0, (4.6)
dztαβ+[Λ,tαβ]∗= 0, (4.7)
(tαβ(z′;y,/vectory)∗C−C∗tαβ(z′;−y,/vectory))/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
z′=−y= 0, (4.8)
18where one should also remember (4.4). Recall, (4.8) is a consequence of (4.7). Notice, that
neitherWnor Λ are sp(2) singlets in a sense of (2.11). However, the equations are. This c an
be shown using (4.6) and (4.7) provided tαβ∈C0
[dxW+W∗W,tαβ]∗= 0, (4.9)
[dzW+{W,Λ}∗+dxΛ,tαβ]∗= 0, (4.10)
where [A,B]∗:=A∗B−B∗A. Following [24] one wishes to drop terms from the ideal at the
level of the generating equations to set it on shell. This is equivalent t o adding an arbitrary
ideal contribution to the generating system (2.28)-(2.30) so, tha t its consistency gets ruined
in its ideal part only. If this is the case, then the factorization resu lts in a consistent on shell
system from the factor space. To be a bit more speciﬁc, consider e q. (2.16), for example, that
we have denoted by A1already. Being an sp(2) singlet, thanks to (4.9), it is an element of the
large HS oﬀ shell algebra
[A1,tαβ]∗= 0. (4.11)
Decomposing
A1=A+Aid, Aid=Aαβ∗tαβ=tαβ∗Aαβ, (4.12)
whereAis any particular representative of the HS algebra (factor algebra ), whileAidis an
element of the ideal. Both should commute with tαβ
[A,tαβ]∗= [Aid,tαβ]∗= 0. (4.13)
In that case the equation of motion A1= 0 entails
A= 0, (4.14)
which is equivalent to dropping oﬀ the part associated with the ideal f rom equations. In
practice, once the z-dependence of Wis resolved via (2.29), eq. (2.16) becomes z-independent.
The natural representative for physical ﬁeld ωisz-independent too. Hence, one has to require
the ideal part to be z-independent
dz(Aαβ∗tαβ) = 0. (4.15)
Let us check now if the addition of Aidof the form (4.12) to (2.16) is indeed consistent. To this
end consider
dxW+W∗W+Aαβ∗tαβ≃0, (4.16)
where≃means equality up to terms that belong to the ideal. Hitting with d xon (4.16) gives
tαβ∗DxAαβ≃0,Dx= dx+[W,•], (4.17)
which do belong to the ideal, since D xtαβ= 0 and tαβ∗Aαβ=Aαβ∗tαβand, therefore,
tαβ∗DxAαβ= DxAαβ∗tαβis a two-sided ideal.
A similar analysis should be carried out for the rest of equations (2.28 )-(2.30). We do not
do it here as we plan to consider it in detail elsewhere.
194.2 Explicit form of sp(2)generators
Let us collect all the conditions for tαβtogether
[tαβ,tγδ]∗=ǫαγtβδ+ǫβγtαδ+ǫαδtβγ+ǫβδtαγ, (4.18)
dxtαβ+[W,tαβ]∗= 0, (4.19)
dztαβ+[Λ,tαβ]∗= 0. (4.20)
While the diﬀerential equations (4.19) and (4.20) are consistent and must have solutions, a
prioriit is not guaranteed that the sp(2) condition (4.18) can be satisﬁed. There is an elegant
explanation on as to why the proper sp(2) exists within the approach of [24]. Its origin is
the algebra of the deformed oscillators that underlies Vasiliev’s mast er equations. It generates
the required sp(2) in the covariant way in terms of the ﬁeld analogous to Λ via its quad ratic
star-product combinations. Our approach is diﬀerent in some aspe cts. In particular, the star
productoperation(2.21)leadstoanill-deﬁnedproduct C1∗C1incontrastwiththeVasilievcase.
Since Λ∈C1, there is no hope we can deﬁne quadratic combinations out of it. Nev ertheless, if
equations(2.28)-(2.30)describeacertaindeformationofthefre eoﬀshellHSunfoldedequations,
the global symmetry of which is sp(2) spanned by (2.13), then one should expect a relevant
deformation in interactions. Baring this option in mind one can try to lo ok at solutions of
(4.18)-(4.20) in perturbations in C(4.3).
At order zero it is easy to see that t0of (2.11) solves all the above conditions. Indeed, (4.18)
is fulﬁlled by its deﬁnition (2.13). Equation (4.19) is satisﬁed because t0is space-time constant,
whileW0=ω(Y) at this order is an sp(2) singlet, (4.1). Equation (4.20) is satisﬁed since t0is
z-independent, while the second term in (4.20) is of the order O(C).
First order To proceed to the next order, let us resolve the undeformed single t condition
(2.11) explicitly. To this end we use convention (2.33) and introduce t he following shorthand
notation

αyb
β:=/vectoryα·/vectoryβ, (4.21)

αyαb:=/vectory⊗/vectory. (4.22)
It is straightforward to check using (2.8), that functions of the f orm
C(y,/vectory|x) :=C(/vectoryy;/vectory⊗/vectory|x) (4.23)
are manifest t0-singlets. At order O(C) eq. (4.19) boils down to

Its consistency (4.8) is just the free sp(2)-singlet condition
[t0
αβ,C]∗= 0, (4.25)
which is solved by (4.23). Therefore, solution of (4.24) exists and we can write it down using
the standard conventional homotopy. Substituting (2.31) into (4 .24) and using

Therefore, Sαβ=t1

ﬁnds that its left hand-side vanishes, while the σ-contribution on the right-hand side survives;
thus,σαβ= 0. Notice also that t1∈C0as required.

prefactor in (4.32) and (4.33) is symmetric under τ→1−τand therefore the two terms above
are the same as consistency (4.31) holds. Less expected is that th e whole right-hand side of
(4.30) vanishes for t1from (4.27)
[t1
αβ,Λ]∗= 0 (4.34)
and, therefore, t2isz-independent. The cancellation in (4.30) can be observed by straigh tfor-
ward star-product calculation using the singlet ansatz (4.23) along with symmetry τ→1−τ
in the measure of (4.27). Moreover, similar analysis results in (see Ap pendix C)
[t1
αβ,t1

This suggests higher order in Ccorrections to tαβare absent as the ﬁnal result that satisﬁes

There are no higher order in Ccorrections as (4.36) is all-order exact.
21Covariant constancy Solution (4.36) is shown to satisfy all the required conditions except
for (4.19). Note, there is no freedom left in (4.36). Given the freed om in solutions of (2.29) for
W, eq. (4.19) can be satisﬁed for some particular choice of W. We now prove that tαβfrom
(4.36) satisﬁes the remaining covariant constancy condition (4.19) provided ﬁeld Wis ﬁxed
canonically (2.20).
Suppose now eq. (4.19) is not valid and therefore,
dxtαβ+[W,tαβ]∗=Rαβ/ne}ationslash= 0. (4.37)
Using (4.20) one ﬁnds the following consistency constraint for R
dzRαβ+[Λ,Rαβ]∗= 0. (4.38)
Let us analyze (4.38) in perturbations. At zeroth order we know th atR0

it follows from (4.38)

z=0= (ω∗Λα−Λα∗ω)z=0, (4.43)
where one also takes into account that d xΛ = 0 at z= 0. Note, W1contains two possible
orderings ω ⋆CandC ⋆ω. If (4.41) is valid, it should be so for each ordering separately. Let
us check ordering ω ⋆Cﬁrst. It is convenient to use the Taylor form of ω(3.13)
ω(y,/vectory) =e−iytω(y′,/vectory)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
y′=0. (4.44)

0dτ τ(1−τ)e−i(1−τ)ytω(y′,/vectory)⋆C(−τt,/vectory)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
y′=0(4.46)
22which precisely matches (4.41) for ordering ω ⋆ C. Similarly, the required cancellation takes
place for ordering C ⋆ω.
At second order we ﬁnd from (4.38) that once R1
αβ= 0, then R2
αβisz-independent and
therefore, from (4.37) the latter can be found as
R2
αβ=/parenleftbig
[W1,t1
αβ]∗+[W2,t0
αβ]∗/parenrightbig
z=0(4.47)
The canonical W2is ofO(z2) and, hence, once t0contains no more than ﬁrst derivative over z,
the second term on the right-hand sise of (4.47) vanishes. Furthe rmore, before setting z= 0
each term from commutator [ W1,t1
αβ]∗can be shown to be of O(z) by direct calculation. So,
the ﬁrst term on the right of (4.47) vanishes at z= 0 just as well. One then concludes that
R2
αβ= 0. The above consideration extends analogously to higher orders due toWnis at least
O(z2) forn≥2, provided the canonical choice of ﬁeld ωis made. This proves (4.19) and
provides the ﬁnal simple form of all-order generators (4.36).
5 Outlook and discussion
We have shown that the Vasiliev type generating equations of [60] ca n be framed to describe
interacting symmetric HS gauge ﬁelds in any dimension. Based on the o ﬀ shell HS algebra
they provide a set of HS compatibility constraints. The dynamical ev olution originates from
factorizationover thetraceideal governed bytheHowedual sp(2)thatreduces thesystem down
to its mass shell. Since the oﬀ shell HS algebra gets deformed in intera ction, the factorization
procedure becomes highly non-trivial and a prioriunknown. To solve this problem we explicitly
ﬁnd ﬁeld-dependent generators of sp(2) commuting with the generating equations. These allow
one to set equations on shell by stripping the traceful contributio ns oﬀ. The remarkable feature
of the generators obtained is a very simple linear in ﬁeld form (4.36), w hich is one of the main
resultsofthecurrentresearch. Thecancellationofhigher-orde rﬁeldcorrectionswasnotobvious
and came as a surprise. This is not typical of the original Vasiliev case as ﬁeld dependence of
sp(2) is not bounded by linear terms in general. A concise form of the ge nerators found makes
on shell analysis feasible, while the HS locality issue in ddimensions amenable.
The main objective of using generating equations of the proposed t ype is all-order spin-
locality of the (oﬀ shell) HS vertices manifestly available via canonical c hoice of ﬁeld variables
(2.20). The respective vertices were shown tobespace-time spin- local in(2.16)andspin-local in
(2.17). To arrive at this result one uses the standard contracting homotopy resolution operator
all the way in perturbations without any further ﬁeld redeﬁnitions, thus implementing the
canonical embedding. The manifest form of oﬀ shell HS vertices hav e been obtained at any
order in a neat form of integrals over hypersimplices, the dimension o f which grows with the
order of perturbation theory.
While we have not carried out the on shell reduction in this paper, an im portant remark
in this regard is in order. The canonical choice (2.20), being irrelevan t to consistency of the
generating equations plays an essential role in factorization of the trace ideal. Namely, in
manifestly deriving sp(2) generators (4.36), it was the canonical embedding that guara nteed
the proposed ansatz to satisfy all necessary constraints.
Let us comment now on the diﬀerences between generating equatio ns (2.28)-(2.30) and the
Vasiliev ones from [24]. The minor diﬀerence is we do not double variables Y’s at nonlinear
level, rather add a two-component zαwhich is suﬃcient to grasp at nonlinear level. We do not
23take advantage of the AdS covariant setting of the original equat ions [24] either as we prefer
to stay in the Lorentz frame. The major departure is the choice of thez-commuting large
algebra (2.21) which signiﬁcantly shifts the whole setting.13As explained in detail in [60] this
choice does not quite live up to the original Vasiliev construction caus ing early inﬁnities in
interactions. This is one of the reasons why Vasiliev’s Zdo not commute.14Nevertheless, it
is precisely the star product (2.21) that eﬀectively manifests while e valuating HS vertices [51]
constrained by locality using the original Vasiliev framework. This app arent contradiction is
resolved by postulating in [60] equations of the form (2.28)-(2.30). As compared to the original
Vasiliev ones, they lackzero-formmodule B, while HSvertices of (2.17) aregenerated by (2.30).
Consistency rests on the remarkable, yet so far poorly understo odprojective identity (2.36).
This identity is strongly tied to a particular solution (2.31) of (2.32). O n the contrary, there is
no formal solution selection for the analog of ﬁeld Λ within the Vasiliev e quations.
Another important diﬀerence is the lack of quadratic contribution Λ ∗Λ in (2.29) in con-
trast with the similar Vasiliev case, where not only it is present due to c onsistency, it plays
a fundamental role. This term is responsible for the local Lorentz s ymmetry of the spinorial
d= 4 equations [17], that would be not otherwise guaranteed. It as we ll plays a key role in the
on shell projection of [24]. In both cases the deformed oscillator alg ebra of the aforementioned
quadratic contribution does the job. This missing ingredient challeng es the global sp(2), which
is necessary to make sense of our equations on shell. Nevertheless , the global sp(2) does exist
in our case, although we ﬁnd its presence not obvious beforehand. It is also worth recalling
that the corresponding generators are of remarkably simple form for the canonical deﬁnition of
the physical ﬁeld (2.20). The latter choice then again is in consonanc e with spin-locality.
Despite the diﬀerences we believe equations (2.28)-(2.30) should fo llow from Vasiliev’s ones
perhaps nontrivially. It would be interesting to understand the link b etween the two systems.
It is not unlikely that the former results from the latter upon star- product contraction along
the lines of Section 6 from [51] and a proper renormalization of the Va siliev vacuum state.
Constrained by associativity, however, the limiting procedure make s its implementation beyond
orderC2challenging.15One reason to expect equations (2.28)-(2.30) may appear as a res ult of
a certain contraction is the structure of functional class (A.3), w hich is a subclass of the one
from [52] designed to reconcile locality. However, in our case the sys tem has no room for a class
bigger than (A.3) at least in perturbations that indicates its reduct ive origin.
In conclusion let us point out some interesting problems for the futu re investigation
•Computation of on shell HS vertices at orders C2andC3and beyond along with exam-
ination of spin-locality. The developed formalism seems quite suitable f or that, as on
the one hand HS vertices are shown to be space-time local to any or der inCat the oﬀ
shell level; thus one is left with a careful analysis of the factorizatio n condition. On the
other hand, the factorization procedure looks encouraging in view of remarkably simple
sp(2) generators (4.36). At this stage it is not clear whether one sho uld proceed along the
lines of the quasiprojector technique [66], [68], [69], [70] (see also [71 ] for the somewhat
degenerate lower dimensional case) in attacking this problem or som e new tools should
13An observation of the limiting star product that leads to (2.21) in [51] was stimulated by the results of [73],
where a relation of speciﬁc homotopy shifts to star-product orde ring was pointed out (see also [74] and [75] for
further discussion on orderings). Equation (2.21) plays a pivotal r ole in the analysis of [60].
14In [69] it was stressed that Z’s should be noncommuting for a yet another reason.
15At order C2equivalence of the two systems can be established using a peculiar ide ntity (6.29) of [51].
24be developed. Indeed, the action of quasiprojectors might not be necessarily compatible
with locality.
•An intriguing HSshift symmetry that manifests itself within the spin-lo cal setting has not
received anadequateexplanationsofar(atechnical reasonisthe presence ofhypersimplex
in the integration domain). In particular, it is interesting to check if it stands the on shell
factorization. Given the results of [57], where spin-locality was show n to follow from
the shift symmetry assumption, it seems likely to deﬁne a class of pro per on shell ﬁeld
representatives from factor space.
•An immediate application of eqs. (2.28)-(2.30) could be the 3 dHS interactions of
Prokushkin and Vasiliev [72], which are on shell due to their spinorial se tup. It would be
interesting to revisit locality issue for this theory.

A. Classes of functions
The important step is to identify a class of functions Crthat lives on all operations entering
(2.28)-(2.30). As the degree of d z- is a grading, the class is graded correspondingly. We deﬁne
r= 0,1,2 to be a label prescribed to zero-, one-, and two-forms, respec tively. Accordingly, we
require
Cr1∗Cr2∈Cr1+r2, (A.1)
dzCr=Cr+1. (A.2)
Conditions (A.1) and (A.2) have been analyzed in [60] with the following e xplicit result: Cr
consists of the following functions

25Diﬀerentiating with respect to sources AandBand then setting them to zero one reproduces
various elements of Cr. Freedom in coeﬃcients contains arbitrary functions of /vectory. Note, that in
orderτ-integration to be well-deﬁned, (A.4) and (A.6) should be at least linea r inA.
The important properties of functions from Crare as follows:
•While not immediately obvious, it has been shown in [60] that functions ( A.3) exhaust all
possible perturbative solutions of (2.28)-(2.30). In particular, z-independent zero-forms
do belong to C0. Therefore, ﬁeld redeﬁnitions ω→ω+F(ω,C...C ) are not constrained
by (A.3). It is also important that ∆(Λ ∗C0)∈C0and ∆(C0∗Λ)∈C0, where ∆ is the
homotopy operator given in (3.4).
•There is an invariance (under proper rescaling) of functions from Crwith respect to the
following star-product reordering operator
Oβφ(z,y;/vectory) =/integraldisplayd2ud2v
(2π)2φ(z+v,y+βu;/vectory)exp(iuαvα). (A.7)
It can be shown that
Oβφ(z,y;/vectory) =φ/parenleftbiggz
1−β,y;/vectory/parenrightbigg
,∀φ∈Cr, (A.8)
whereβis an arbitrary number. It plays a role of a reordering parameter of the original
Vasiliev star product [51]. The limiting star product (2.21) emerges fr om the Vasiliev
one in the limit β→ −∞. Eq. (A.7) says that (A.3) is a ﬁxed point of the re-ordering
operator (upon a proper rescaling).
•Lastly, product Cr1∗Cr2is well-deﬁned provided r1+r2<2 or one of the functions (from
C0) isz-independent, while another one belongs to C2.

Note that f(y) isz-independent.

one has

AandB. In order to be well-deﬁned there must be no contribution at B= 0. In other words,
fshould be at least linear in B.
As we consider mostly left ordering ωC... C , we have at order n+1
Wn+1=−∆(Wn∗Λ), (B.3)

(B.8)-(B.10) is given by (3.31) and (3.32) that can be proven by induc tion. Indeed, assuming
(3.31) and (3.32) hold at order nand plugging these expressions explicitly in (B.8), (B.9) we

Jacobian Let us show now that ( λ,ν) variables imply µn+1×J= 1, where Jis the Jacobian
of (σ,ρ)→(λ,ν) variable change. For n= 1 one notes that µ1= 1. For n≥1 we can show
µn= 1. The proof goes inductively. Assuming µn= 1, we then have from (B.7)
µn+1=ρ1...ρnσn+1(1−σn+1)n−1. (B.22)
Variable change (B.15), (B.16) yields its further multiplication by the J acobian arising from
integration over the following δ-functions
J=δ(λ′
i−(1−σn+1)λi)δ(ν′

with respect to λiandνi. By integrating out delta-functions we see that they exactly canc el
out (B.22)
µn+1×J= 1. (B.24)
Integration domain The conﬁguration space is easily identiﬁed by induction. Assuming it
is given by (3.35), (3.36) at order n, being the case at n= 1 (somewhat trivially, since λ1= 1)
andn= 2 (regularly), one sees from (B.15) that λ-hypersimplex extends to the order n+ 1,
while from (B.16) and (B.17) the ν-hypersimplex holds at n+ 1 too. Now, let us show that
the shoelace constraint (3.36) holds at the next order. To see this we ﬁrst note, that (3.36) is
equivalent to
λiνj−λjνi≥0, i > j. (B.25)
From (B.15), (B.16), (B.17) and (B.18) it follows that if (B.25) is true, then
λ′

i′λ′
j′≥0, i′> j′(B.26)
and, therefore, (3.36) remains valid at order n+1.

Let us check that (4.36) indeed generates sp(2) commutation relations (4.18). We have
tαβ=t0
αβ+t1
αβ, (C.1)
wheret0is given in (2.11), while t1is deﬁned in (4.27). In order to see that (4.18) is fulﬁlled
we are left to check that
[t1
αβ,t1
γδ]∗= 0. (C.2)
Speciﬁc dependence on /vectoryinCis not going to be important in what follows, so we just set
C=C(y,/vectory) and, correspondingly,

αβ=−zαzβ/integraldisplay1
0dτ τ(1−τ)C(−τz;/vectory)eiτzy. (C.3)
We proceed with the Taylor representation of ﬁeld C, (3.14)
C(y,/vectory)≡e−iypC(y′,/vectory)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
y′=0,pα=−i∂
∂y′α. (C.4)
Using (2.21) it is easy to derive the following useful product

0dτ1τ1(1−τ1)eiτ1z(y+p1)∗zγzδ/integraldisplay1
