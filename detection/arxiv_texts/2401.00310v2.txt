1. Introduction
Periodic optimal control problems have been attracting considera ble interest in the mathematical
literature [ 1–4] and play a signiﬁcant role in a variety of emerging engineering applicat ions (see,
e.g., [5–9] and references therein). Our current paper is motivated by the previous analysis of
nonlinear optimization problems with isoperimetric constraints [ 10,11], where the main goal is
to optimize the cost functional on periodic trajectories under disc ontinuous control strategies. A
crucial ingredient for achieving this goal is the characterization of the set of periodic solutions for
a nonlinear control system with bang-bang inputs.

In the paper [ 11], the Chen–Fliess series have been exploited for constructing the τ-periodic
solutions of nonlinear control-aﬃne systems with switching. This app roach allows representing the
initial data of the considered system as a solution of nonlinear algebr aic equations, whose order
depends on the remainder of the Chen–Fliess series for small τ >0. The construction of [ 11] has
also been extended to a class of nonlinear chemical reaction models in non-aﬃne form in [ 12]. Note
that the convergenceofthe Chen–Fliess expansionis not guarant eedoveran arbitrarytime interval
[0,τ] even for systems with analytic vector ﬁelds, and other approxima tion techniques should be
developed to design periodic solutions for nonlinear control system s with large periods. It should
be noted that the results of [ 10–12] have been applied to nonlinear chemical reaction models in
the case of small periods of control functions. In the recent pap er [13], it was shown that the
optimal controls are bang-bang for an isoperimetric optimization pr oblem described by a nonlinear
hyperbolic partial diﬀerential equation with periodic boundary cond itions. The optimization of
chemical reactions using periodic input modulations is of great import ance in modern chemical
engineering [ 14], as it supports to develop technology that increases the yield of re action products
as compared to steady operation.
Fordiﬀerent classesofnonlinearordinarydiﬀerentialequationswit h regularright-handsides, the
problems of existence and approximation of periodic solutions have b een studied by the method of
generalized quasilinearization [ 16], comparison techniques [ 17], ﬁxed point theory [ 18], reproducing
kernel methods [ 19], and other techniques. The presented list of references does no t pretend to be
exhaustive.
To the best of our knowledge, a complete characterization of perio dic trajectories for a given
nonlinear system of ordinary diﬀerential equations with discontinuo us right-hand sides remains
open up to now. The purpose of this paper is to provide such a chara cterization, along with
eﬃcient computational methods for approximating the solutions of nonlinear systems of the form:
˙x(t) =Ax(t)+g(x(t))+u(t), x(t) = (x1(t),...,xn(t))⊤∈D⊂Rn, t∈[0,τ],(1.1)
under the periodic boundary condition:
x(τ) =x(0), (1.2)
whereDis a domain containing the origin x= 0∈Rn,Ais a constant n×nmatrix,g(·)∈
C1(D;Rn) represents the nonlinearity, and u(·)∈L∞([0,τ];Rn) is an arbitrary input function
(control).
As the function u(t) is allowed to be discontinuous, we treat the solutions of ( 1.1) in the sense
of Carath´ eodory [ 20, Chap. 1] as solutions of the following integral equation
x(t) =x0+/integraldisplayt
0[Ax(s)+g(x(s))+u(s)]ds, x0=x(0).
The existence and uniqueness results for solutions to diﬀerential e quations, with the right-hand
sides being continuous in xand discontinuous in tunder the Carath´ eodory conditions, are sum-
marized in [ 20, Chap. 1]. By using the variation of constants method and introduc ing the matrix
exponential etA, we can rewrite the above equation in the form
x(t) =etAx0+/integraldisplayt
0e(t−s)A[g(x(s))+u(s)]ds. (1.3)
Letx(t) be a solution of ( 1.3) with some u(t) on [0,τ] such that x(τ) =x(0), then x(t) can be
extended to the τ-periodic function ˜ x(t), deﬁned for all t∈R. If, moreover, the function ˜ u(t) is
τ-periodic and ˜ u(t) =u(t) for all t∈[0,τ), then ˜x(t) satisﬁes ( 1.3) with the input ˜ u(t) for all
t∈R. Because of this simple fact, we will refer to the Carath´ eodory so lutions of boundary value
problem ( 1.1)–(1.2) as periodic solutions. If x(t) is a solution of ( 1.1)–(1.2), then formula ( 1.3)
allows to represent its initial value x0=x(0) =x(τ):
x0= (e−τA−I)−1/integraldisplayτ
0e−sA[g(x(s))+u(s)]ds, (1.4)

whereIis the identity matrix. An immediate consequence of equation ( 1.4)for the case of linear
systems on D=Rnis that the system ( 1.1) withg(x)≡0 and any u(·)∈L∞([0,τ];Rn)has
a unique periodic solution x(t) ont∈[0,τ], and its initial data x0=x(0) is deﬁned by ( 1.4) if
assumption ( A1) holds. The existence of periodic solutions has been studied for weakly nonlinear
boundary value problems with piecewise-constant right-hand sides in [21]. That paper develops
perturbation analysis techniques for nonlinear diﬀerential equatio ns with switching under periodic
boundary conditions. A modiﬁed iterative scheme is proposed there for constructing approximate
periodic solutions. Note that the contribution of [ 21] is limited to systems of ordinary diﬀerential
equations with a small parameter, and future studies are needed f or systems of the form ( 1.1) with
general nonlinearities g(x) and merely measurable inputs u(t).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a simple iteration method is adapted
to construct the periodic solutions of ( 1.1) under fairly mild assumptions on u(t) andg(x). The
convergence of this scheme is justiﬁed in terms of the period τ, the growth rate of the matrix
exponential etA, and the Lipschitz constant of g(x) (Theorem 2.1). The operator formulation
of the periodic boundary value problem for equation ( 1.1) is exploited in Section 3to derive
Newton’s method. Suﬃcient convergence conditions for Newton’s it erations are explicitly stated
in Theorem 3.4, with the proofprovidedin Appendix A. The proposediterativeappr oachis applied
to a nonlinear chemical reaction model in Section 4. The ﬁnal conclusions and perspectives are
outlined in Section 5.
1.1. Notations
For further analysis, let X=C([0,τ];Rn) denote the Banach space of all continuous functions
x(t) from [0 ,τ] toRn, equipped with the norm
/bardblx(·)/bardblX:= sup
t∈[0,τ]/bardblx(t)/bardbl,
where/bardblξ/bardblis the Euclidean norm of a column vector ξ∈Rn. We will also omit the subscript
Xreferring to the norm of elements of Xfor brevity. The Euclidean norm induces the 2-norm
/bardblA/bardbl:= sup/bardblξ/bardbl≤1/bardblAξ/bardblof a matrix A, which will be used throughout the text. The space of
bounded linear operators, acting from XtoX, is denoted byL(X,X). We will also use the
notations XD=C([0,τ];D) andXD′=C([0,τ];D′) whenD′⊂Dis a closed domain. The
Jacobian matrix of a function g∈C1(D;Rn) will be denoted as g′(ξ) =∂g(ξ)
∂ξ. For a function
x∈X,g′(x(s)) stands for the substitution of ξ=x(s) ing′(ξ).
2. Simple iteration method
Let us introduce the nonlinear operator F:XD→Xdeﬁned as follows:
F:x/ma√sto→F(x)(t) =etAc(x)+/integraldisplayt
0e(t−s)A[g(x(s))+u(s)]ds, (2.1)
where the vector functional c:XD→Rnis given by
c(x) = (e−τA−I)−1/integraldisplayτ
0e−sA[g(x(s))+u(s)]ds. (2.2)
If an initial function x(0)∈XDis given, we generate the sequence of functions x(k)=F(x(k−1)) for
k= 1,2,.... This sequence is well-deﬁned, particularly when XD=X(i.e.,D=Rn). IfD/ne}ationslash=Rn,
we consequently assume that F(x(k))(t)∈Dfor allt∈[0,τ],k= 1,2,.... Below, we propose
suﬃcient conditions for the convergence of x(k)(t) to aτ-periodic solution of system ( 1.1).
Theorem 2.1. Assume that (A1)holds and that there exist constants L≥0,M≥1,ω >0, and
a closed convex domain D′⊂Dsuch that:
/bardblg′(ξ)/bardbl≤L,/bardbletA/bardbl≤Meω|t|for allξ∈D, t∈[−τ,τ]; ( A2)
Preprint (Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Tech nical Systems, Magdeburg). 2024-12-044
F(x)∈XD′for each x∈XD′; ( A3)
ML(1+MRτ)(eωτ−1)
ω<1, (A4)
where
Rτ=/vextenddouble/vextenddouble(e−τA−I)−1/vextenddouble/vextenddouble. (2.3)
Then, for any x(0)∈XD′, the sequence
x(k)=F(x(k−1)), k= 1,2,...
converges to the limit x∗∈XD′ask→∞. This limit function x∗(t),t∈[0,τ], is the unique
solution of system (1.1)such that x∗(0) =x∗(τ).
Proof.Under assumptions ( A1)–(A2), the operator F:XD→Xdeﬁned by ( 2.1) is Fr´ echet
diﬀerentiable. Indeed, the Fr´ echet derivative F′(x) :X→Xatx∈XDis a bounded linear
operator, and its action on δx∈Xis deﬁned as follows:
F′(x)(δx)(t) =etAc′
x(δx)+/integraldisplayt
0e(t−s)Ag′(x(s))δx(s)ds, (2.4)
where
c′
x(δx) = (e−τA−I)−1/integraldisplayτ
0e−sAg′(x(s))δx(s)ds. (2.5)
By taking into account inequalities ( A2), we conclude that
/bardblF′(x)(δx)/bardblX≤/braceleftBigg

t∈[0,τ],ξ∈D/bardbletA/bardbl·/bardbl(e−τA−I)−1/bardbl/integraldisplayτ

We see that the operator Fis contractive on XD′if condition ( A4) holds. Additionally, F(XD′)⊆
XD′due to assumption ( A3), and the metric space ( XD′,d) equipped with the distance d(x,y) =
/bardblx−y/bardblXis complete. Thus, the assertion of Theorem 2.1follows from the Banach ﬁxed point
theorem [ 22, Chap. XVI, §1, Thm. 1 and Chap. XVII, §1, Thm. 1].
Remark 2.1. The initial function x(0)(t)can be taken, in particular, as x(0)(t)≡0. In this
case, it is easy to see that the ﬁrst approximation x(1)(t)is the solution of the linear system
˙x(1)=Ax(1)+u(t)+g(0),t∈[0,τ], such that x(1)(0) =x(1)(τ).
3. Newton’s method
In this section, we develop Newton’s method for ﬁnding the ﬁxed poin ts ofF. For this purpose,
we introduce the nonlinear operator P:XD→Xsuch that
P(x) =F(x)−x, (3.1)
whereF:XD→Xis deﬁned by ( 2.1)–(2.2). It is clear that the ﬁxed points of Fare solutions to
the equation P(x) = 0.
Given an initial function x(0)∈XDsuch that the operator [ P′(x(0))]−1is nonsingular, we deﬁne
the sequence of modiﬁed Newton’s iterations {x(k)}∞
k=0by the rule [ 22]:
x(k+1)=x(k)−[P′(x(0))]−1P(x(k)), k= 0,1,... . (3.2)
Preprint (Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Tech nical Systems, Magdeburg). 2024-12-045
We also consider the “classical” Newton’s sequence {˜x(k)}∞
k=0, deﬁned as
˜x(k+1)= ˜x(k)−[P′(˜x(k))]−1P(˜x(k)),˜x(0)=x(0), k= 0,1,... . (3.3)
In order to represent the action of the operator [ P′(x)]−1on a vector function δy∈X, we solve
the following functional equation with respect to δx∈X:
P′(x)δx=δy,
or, equivalently,
F′(x)(δx)−δx=δy.
The above equation can be rewritten, due to ( 2.4), in the form
c′
x(δx)+/integraldisplayt
0e−sAg′(x(s))δx(s)ds−e−tAδx(t) =e−tAδy(t), t∈[0,τ]. (3.4)
By diﬀerentiating this formula with respect to tand introducing the function δz(t) =δx(t)+δy(t),
we obtain
˙δz(t) = (A+g′(x(t)))δz(t)−g′(x(t))δy(t). (3.5)
Let Φx(t)∈Mat(n×n) be the fundamental matrix of the corresponding homogeneous s ystem, i.e.,
Φx(0) =I,˙Φx(t) = (A+g′(x(t)))Φx(t) fort∈[0,τ]. (3.6)
Note that the matrix Φ−1
x(s) is well-deﬁned for all s∈[0,τ] due to the uniqueness of solutions
to the Cauchy problem ( 3.6). Then, the variation of constants method yields the general solu tion
of (3.5):
δz(t) = Φx(t)δz(0)−Φx(t)/integraldisplayt
0Φ−1
x(s)g′(x(s))δy(s)ds.
We rewrite the above formula with respect to δx(t) =δz(t)−δy(t) as
δx(t) = Φx(t)Cx−Φx(t)/integraldisplayt
0Φ−1
x(s)g′(x(s))δy(s)ds−δy(t). (3.7)
The integration constant Cx=δx(0) +δy(0) is deﬁned from ( 3.4). Indeed, the relation ( 3.4)
att= 0 implies that Cx=δx(0) +δy(0) =δxc(δx). The integration constant Ccan then be
eliminated by substituting ( 3.7) into (2.5). Thus, we have:

We summarize the construction of [ P′(x)]−1in the following lemmas.
Lemma 3.1. Let assumption (A2)hold, and let x(t)∈Dbe a continuous function on t∈[0,τ].
Then the fundamental matrix Φx(t)in(3.6)satisﬁes the following norm estimates:
/bardblΦx(t)/bardbl≤φL(t),/bardblΦ−1
x(t)/bardbl≤φL(t), φL(t) =√ne(/bardblA/bardbl+L)t, t∈[0,τ]. (3.10)
Proof.The estimates in ( 3.10) easily follow from Gr¨ onwall’s inequality.
Lemma 3.2. Let assumptions (A1)–(A2)be satisﬁed, and let
S=√nMLR τ(e(/bardblA/bardbl+L+ω)τ−1)
/bardblA/bardbl+L+ω<1. (A5)
Then the matrix Mxis nonsingular, and /bardblM−1

This lemma is proved in Appendix A.
Lemma 3.3. Givenx∈X, let the matrices Φx(t)andMxbe deﬁned by (3.6)and(3.9), respec-
tively, and assume that Mxis nonsingular. Then there exists [P′(x)]−1:X→X, and for any
δy∈X, the value δx= [P′(x)]−1δy∈Xis deﬁned by formulas (3.7)and(3.8). If, in addi-
tion, assumptions (A2)and(A5)are satisﬁed, then the linear operator [P′(x)]−1is bounded and
/bardbl[P′(x)]−1/bardbl≤ρ1, where
ρ1= 1+LφL(τ)(φL(τ)−√n)

Proof.The above formulas ( 3.7)–(3.9) deﬁne the action of [ P′(x)]−1on an arbitrary δy∈X,
provided that the matrix Mxis nonsingular. It remains to prove that [ P′(x)]−1∈L(X,X) under
assumptions ( A2) and ( A5). For this purpose, we estimate the norm of δx∈Xin (3.7) and
the norm of Cx∈Rnin (3.8) using Lemmas 3.1and3.2, along with the triangle and H¨ older’s
inequalities:
/bardblδx/bardbl≤φL(τ)/bardblCx/bardbl+/parenleftbiggLφL(τ)(φL(τ)−√n)

Formulas( 3.12) implythat/bardbl[P′(x)]−1/bardbl≤ρ1(x), withρ1(x) expressedin ( 3.11), therebycompleting
the proof of this lemma.
To formulate suﬃcient conditions for the convergence of Newton’s method, we assume that
g(ξ) = (g1(ξ),...,gn(ξ))⊤is twice continuously diﬀerentiable and that the Hessian matrices of it s
components are bounded, i.e.,
g∈C2(D;Rn),/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble∂2gk(ξ)
∂ξi∂ξj/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≤¯Hfor allξ∈D, k= 1,2,...,n, (A6)
with some constant ¯H≥0. We also deﬁne the functional ρ0:X×L∞([0,τ];Rn)→R≥0and the
nonnegative constant ρ2by the following rules:
ρ0(x,u) =/bardblx/bardbl+M(eωτ−1)(1+MRτeωτ)

We summarize the convergence conditions of Newton’s iteration sch emes (3.2) and (3.3) in the
following theorem.
Theorem 3.4. Let assumptions (A1),(A2),(A5), and(A6)be satisﬁed. Given x(0)∈XD,

Then, there exists an x∗∈Br0(x(0))such that P(x∗) = 0, and both the modiﬁed (3.2)and
classical (3.3)schemes converge to x∗ask→+∞. The convergence rates of these schemes are
estimated by the following inequalities:

4. Application to a controlled chemical reaction model
In this section, we apply the proposed iterative schemes to study p eriodic trajectories of the non-
isothermal chemical reaction model of order γconsidered in [ 10]:
˙x(t) =Ax(t)+g(x(t))+u(t), x(t)∈D⊂R2, u(t)∈U⊂R2, t∈[0,τ], (4.1)
where

andk1,k2,γ,κ,φ1,φ2are real parameters. System ( 4.1) describes the deviations of the dimen-
sionless concentration x1(t) and temperature x2(t) from their reference values in a reactor, where
the inlet concentration and temperature are controlled by u(t). This system admits the trivial
equilibrium x1=x2= 0 foru(t)≡0, which corresponds to steady-state reactor operation. In th e
general case, the function u(t) can encode complex control scenarios and is assumed to be of clas s

. The constraints x1>−1 andx2>−1 inDpostulate that the corresponding phys-
ical concentration and absolute temperature in Kelvin must be posit ive. The physical meaning of
the parameters of system ( 4.1) is discussed in [ 10], and we take the following values for numerical
simulations [ 11]:

This choice of parameters corresponds to the hydrolysis reaction
(CH3CO)2O+H 2O→2CH3COOH
considered in [ 10,11], wherex1(t) represents the dimensionless deviation of the product concentr a-
tion from its steady-state value. The control constraints in ( 4.1), (4.2) allow for the modulation of
the inlet reactant concentration u1(t) with a physical amplitude of 85%, and the variation of the
dimensionless temperature u2(t)∈[umin

2] corresponds to controlling the temperature in the
inlet stream from 275 K to 315 K around the reference temperatur e of 295 K.
Forthe periodicproblemofmaximizingthe mean productconcentrat ionin this realisticreaction,
it was shown in [ 10] that each optimal solution is achieved through a class of bang-ban g controls.
However, the question of the existence of τ-periodic solutions for system ( 4.1) under a given bang-
bang control remains unresolved. We apply the iterative schemes d eveloped in Sections 2and3to
compute τ-periodic trajectories for the considered model with an arbitrary admissible control over
the interval [0 ,τ].
To test the simple iteration method described in Section 2, we ﬁx a grid size nG∈Nand

The modiﬁed Newton’s method, deﬁned by the sequence ( 3.2), is implemented in Algorithm 2.
As in the ﬁrst algorithm, we choose the initial approximation x(0)(t)≡0. In this case, the
variational system of equations ( 3.6) becomes autonomous, and the corresponding fundamental
matrix Φx(0)(t) is eﬃciently represented by the matrix exponential:
Φx(0)(t) =et(A+g′(0))for allt∈R.
The above formula allows us to evaluate the linear operator [ P′(x(0))]−1using the construction
from Lemma 3.3. In Algorithm 2, we approximate the corresponding integrals in ( 3.7)–(3.9) by
the rectangle quadrature rule.
Algorithms 1and2have been implemented in Maple 2020 with the use of the MatrixExponential
function to evaluate etA. In the subsequent simulations, we deﬁne the function u(t) to be constant
on each subinterval of the partition
0 =τ0< τ1<···< τN=τ,
i.e.,
u(t) =N/summationdisplay
i=1u(i)χ[τi−1,τi)(t), u(τ) =u(N), χ[τi−1,τi)(t) =/braceleftbigg1, t∈[τi−1,τi),
0, t /∈[τi−1,τi).(4.3)
The function u(t) in (4.3) corresponds to a family of bang-bang controls with the values u(i)∈∂U
taken at the boundary of U.
To illustrate the behavior of periodic solutions of system ( 4.1) with discontinuous u(t) of the
form (4.3), we ﬁx N= 5 and consider the switching sequence

together with the following switching time parameterization:

Algorithms 1and2have been executed for system ( 4.1) with the above choice of u(t) on a grid
of sizenG= 105and with the number of iterations nI= 9. For the simulations, we have used

Table 1: Residuals d(k)for Algorithms 1and2withnG= 105andτ= 1.
As shown in Table 1, the resulting residuals (which measure the appro ximation error) decrease
monotonically as the iteration number kincreases. The modiﬁed Newton’s method (Algorithm 2)
ensures considerably faster convergence compared to the simple iteration method (Algorithm 1).
We see that all the approximate solutions are τ-periodic, considering the numerical tolerance of
the computations.
A signiﬁcant reduction in residuals is already achieved in Algorithm 2by iteration k= 8. Since
the rectangle quadrature rule is used to approximate the integrals withmerely measurable input
functions u∈L∞[0,τ], it is natural to expect that there will be no signiﬁcant decay in resid uals in
subsequent iterations of the modiﬁed Newton’s method, especially w hen the precision of numerical
computations becomes dominant.
5. Conclusions and future work
The key contribution of this paper establishes general existence a nd uniqueness conditions for τ-
periodic solutions of nonlinear control systems of the form ( 1.1) with discontinuous input functions
(of class L∞) and general nonlinearities (of class C1). Our crucial assumption is the dominant
linearization condition det/parenleftbig
e−τA−I/parenrightbig
/ne}ationslash= 0, which relates the period τto the spectral properties of
the matrix exponential of Afrom (1.1).
It should be emphasized that suﬃcient convergence conditions for the corresponding operator
formulations are presented explicitly for the simple iteration method (Theorem 2.1) and Newton’s
method (Theorem 3.4). In Theorem 3.4, the theoretical convergence rates are explicitly given by
formulas ( 3.17) and (3.18). Our case study justiﬁes the applicability of the proposed iteratio n
schemes to nonlinear control systems describing non-isothermal chemical reaction models. To
the best of our knowledge, the question of existence and uniquene ss of periodic solutions for
the model considered in Section 4, with arbitrary discontinuous inputs, has not been previously
Preprint (Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Tech nical Systems, Magdeburg). 2024-12-0412
analyzed. The presented algorithms allow the use of general discon tinuous functions u(t) without
any regularity assumptions except for integrability on [0 ,τ]. Due to this generality, no high-order
quadrature formulas have been incorporated into Algorithms 1and2. As a potential direction for
improvement, adaptive quadrature rules can be applied to approxim ate integrals involving u(t),
taking into account the regularity of input signals on the intervals ( τi,τi+1) within the context of
the bang-bang parameterizations considered in Section 4. We consider the development of such
adaptive schemes, as well as the numerical implementation of Newto n’s iterations in the form
of (3.3) with an eﬃcient inversion of P′, to be topics for future research.
We also note that for problems with a higher number of state variable s, the eﬃciency of the
algorithms can be improved by modern techniques from numerical line ar algebra that compute the
action of matrix exponentials to vectors without explicitly forming th e notoriously problematic
matrix exponential explicitly. This will be explored when studying the a pplication of our approach
for more complex reaction networks.

to (3.1), (2.1), (2.2) under assumption ( A2):

whereRτis given by ( 2.3). The above inequalities and assumption ( A2) imply that
/bardblP(x)/bardbl≤ρ0(x,u) for all x∈XD, u∈L∞([0,τ];Rn), (A.3)
provided that ρ0(x,u) is deﬁned in ( 3.13).
It remains to prove that the second derivative of P(x) exists and to estimate the norm of P′′(x).
We recall that P′′(x) :X×X→Xatx∈XDis a bilinear operator such that [ 22, Chap. XVII]:
P′′(x)(x1,x2) = lim
ε→01
ε/parenleftBig

, (A.4)
provided that the above limit exists uniformly with respect to x1,x2∈Xwith/bardblx1/bardbl=/bardblx2/bardbl= 1.
AsP(x) =F(x)−x, thenP′′(x) =F′′(x) if the latter second derivative exists. Given x∈XD,
x1,x2∈X, the value of the function P′′(x)(x1,x2) att∈[0,τ] is thus deﬁned by exploiting
formulas ( 2.4), (2.5), and (A.4) as follows:
P′′(x)(x1,x2)(t) = lim

Sinceg∈C2(D;R2), the second derivative of gat anyξ∈Dis a bounded bilinear operator
g′′(ξ) :Rn×Rn→Rn, and the limit in ( A.5) is well-deﬁned. The components of the column
vectorg′′(ξ)(ξ1,ξ2) for given ξ1= (ξ1

Then, the limit in ( A.5) takes the following form with the use of g′′:

Formula ( A.7) deﬁnes the bounded bilinear operator P′′(x) :X×X→Xfor anyx∈XD. Indeed,
to show the boundedness of P′′(x), we estimate the norm of P′′(x)(x1,x2) in (A.7) using the
triangle inequality, H¨ older’s inequality, and estimate ( A.6):

where the constant ρ2is deﬁned by ( 3.14). The above inequality means that
/bardblP′′(x)/bardbl≤ρ2for allx∈XD. (A.8)
Givenx(0)∈XDandu∈L∞([0,τ];Rn), conditions ( A.2), (A.3), (A.8), (3.15), and (3.16) imply
that the assumptions of the Newton–Kantorovich theorem [ 22, Chap. XVIII, Theorem 6] (see also
[15, Theorem 1.1]) are satisﬁed with:
/bardblΓ0P(x(0))/bardbl≤η=ρ1ρ0(x(0),u),/bardblΓ0P′′(x))/bardbl≤K=ρ1ρ2for allx∈D,

Then, the assertions of Theorem 3.4follow from the Newton–Kantorovich theorem.
