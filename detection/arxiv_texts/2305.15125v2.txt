Abstract
The Shapley–Folkman theorem is a statement about the Minkow ski sum of (non-
convex) sets, expressing the closeness of the Minkowski sum to convexity in a quanti-
tative manner. This paper establishes similar theorems for integrally convex sets, M♮-
convex sets, and L♮-convex sets, which are major classes of discrete convex set s in dis-
crete convex analysis.

11 Introduction
The Shapley–Folkman theorem is concerned with the Minkowsk i sum of (non-convex) sets
and expresses the closeness of the Minkowski sum to convexit y in a quantitative manner.
The theorem was ﬁrst discovered in the literature of economi cs (Arrow–Hahn [1], Starr [17,
18]) and found applications also in optimization (Aubin–Ek eland [2], Ekeland–T´ emam [5],
Bertsekas [3, 4]) and other ﬁelds of mathematics (Fradelizi –Madiman–Marsiglietti–Zvavitch
[7]).
To describe the Shapley–Folkman theorem we need to introduc e some terminology and
notation. The Minkowski sum (orvector sum ) of sets S1,S2⊆Rnmeans the subset of Rn
deﬁned by
S1+S2={x+y|x∈S1,y∈S2}. (1.1)
This operation can natually be extended to the Minkowski sum/summationtextm
i=1Si=S1+S2+···+Smof
an arbitrary number of sets Si⊆Rn(i=1,2,..., m). The Minkowski sum of convex sets is
again convex. For any subset SofRn, we denote its convex hull byS, which is, by deﬁnition,
the smallest convex set containing S. As is well known, Scoincides with the set of all
convex combinations of (ﬁnitely many) elements of S. It is known that S1+S2+···+Sm=
S1+S2+···+Sm.
For any set S(⊆Rn), the radius rad(S) and the inner radius r (S) are deﬁned by
rad(S)=inf
x∈Rnsup
y∈S/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−y/⌊ar⌈⌊l2, (1.2)
r(S)=sup
x∈Sinf
T{rad(T)|T⊆S,x∈T}. (1.3)
The inner radius r(S) expresses the size of holes or dents in S, and we have r(S)=0 for a
convex set S.
The following theorem [1, Theorem B.10] expresses the close ness of the Minkowski sum
of (non-convex) sets to convexity in a quantitative manner. This theorem is often referred to
as the Shapley–Folkman–Starr theorem, as it was derived by S tarr [17] from the Shapley–
Folkman theorem [1, Theorem B.9] as a (non-trivial) corolla ry.
Theorem 1.1 (Shapley–Folkman–Starr) .Let S i(i=1,2,..., m)be compact subsets of Rn
such that r (Si)≤L for i=1,2,..., m for some L∈R. Let W=S1+S2+···+Sm. For any
x∈W, there exists z∈W that satisﬁes/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l2≤L√min( n,m).
A key fact used in the proof of Theorem 1.1 is the following the orem, which formulates a
phenomenon in the Minkowski summation that may be compared t o Carath´ eodory’s theorem
for convex combinations.
Theorem 1.2 (Shapley–Folkman) .Let S i⊆Rn(i=1,2,..., m), and W=S1+S2+···+Sm.
For any x∈W, there exists a subset I of the index set {1,2,..., m}such that|I|≤min( n,m)
and x∈/summationtext
i∈ISi+/summationtext
j∈JSj, where J={1,2,..., m}\I.
Theorem 1.2 is ascribed to Shapley and Folkman in [1, Theorem B.8], and is often referred
to as the Shapley–Folkman lemma. Although the statement of [ 1, Theorem B.8] involves an
assumption of compactness of each Si, it is possible to avoid this assumption by using an
algebraic proof based on Carath´ eodory’s theorem (Bertsek as [3, Proposition 5.7.1], Fradelizi–
Madiman–Marsiglietti–Zvavitch [7, Lemma 2.3]). Alternat ive proofs of Theorem 1.2 can be
2found in Ekeland–T´ emam [5, Appendix I] (without the compac tness assumption) and Howe
[9] (under the compactness assumption).
The objective of this paper is to establish theorems similar to Theorem 1.1 in the context
of discrete convex analysis [8, 10, 11, 12]. Section 2 is devo ted to the preliminaries from
discrete convex analysis, and the main results are describe d in Section 3. Theorems 3.1
and 3.2 give two variants of the Shapley–Folkman-type theor em for integrally convex sets,
Theorem 3.4 deals with M♮-convex sets, and Theorem 3.5 with L♮-convex sets (where ♮is
read “natural”). The proofs are given in Section 4, where The orems 1.1 and 1.2 are used.
2 Preliminaries from Discrete Convex Analysis
2.1 Integrally convex sets
Integral convexity is a fundamental concept in discrete con vex analysis, introduced by Favati–
Tardella [6] for functions deﬁned on the integer lattice Zn. In this paper we use the concept
of integrally convex sets, as formulated in [11, Section 3.4 ] as a special case of integrally
convex functions. The reader is referred to [15] for a recent comprehensive survey on integral
convexity.
Forx∈Rntheintegral neighborhood ofxis deﬁned by
N(x)={z∈Zn||xi−zi|<1 (i=1,2,..., n)}. (2.1)
It is noted that strict inequality “ <” is used in this deﬁnition and N( x) admits an alternative
expression
N(x)={z∈Zn|⌊xi⌋≤zi≤⌈xi⌉(i=1,2,..., n)}, (2.2)
where, for t∈Rin general,⌊t⌋denotes the largest integer not larger than t(rounding-down to
the nearest integer) and ⌈t⌉is the smallest integer not smaller than t(rounding-up to the nearest
integer). That is, N( x) consists of all integer vectors zbetween⌊x⌋=(⌊x1⌋,⌊x2⌋,...,⌊xn⌋)
and⌈x⌉=(⌈x1⌉,⌈x2⌉,...,⌈xn⌉).
For a set S⊆Znandx∈Rnwe call the convex hull of S∩N(x) the local convex hull of
Saround x. A nonempty set S⊆Znis said to be integrally convex if the union of the local
convex hulls S∩N(x) over x∈Rnis convex. In other words, a set S⊆Znis called integrally
convex if
S=/uniondisplay
x∈RnS∩N(x). (2.3)
This condition is equivalent to saying that every point xin the convex hull of Sis contained
in the convex hull of S∩N(x), i.e.,
x∈S=⇒x∈S∩N(x). (2.4)
Obviously, every subset of {0,1}nis integrally convex.
We say that a set S⊆Znishole-free if
S=S∩Zn. (2.5)
It is known that an integrally convex set is hole-free; see [1 5, Proposition 2.2] for a formal
proof.

2.2 Minkowski sum in discrete convex analysis
Minkowski summation is an intriguing operation in discrete setting. The naive looking rela-
tion
S1+S2=(S1+S2)∩Zn(2.6)
is not always true, as Example 2.1 below shows. It may be said t hat if (2.6) is true for some
class of discrete convex sets, this equality captures a cert ain essence of the discrete convexity
in question.
Example 2.1 ([11, Example 3.15]) .The Minkowski sum of S1={(0,0),(1,1)}andS2=
{(1,0),(0,1)}is equal to S1+S2={(1,0),(0,1),(2,1),(1,2)}, for which (1,1)∈(S1+S2)\
(S1+S2). That is, the Minkowski sum S1+S2has a ‘hole’ at (1,1). See Figure 1.
In Example 2.1 above, both S1andS2are integrally convex. This shows that (2.6) is not
guaranteed for integrally convex sets and that the Minkowsk i sum of integrally convex sets is
not necessarily integrally convex.
A subclass of integrally convex sets, called M♮-convex sets, is well-behaved with respect
to Minkowski summation. A (nonempty) set S⊆Znis called M♮-convex if it enjoys the
following exchange property:
For any x,y∈Sandi∈{1,2,..., n}with xi>yi, we have
(i)x−1i∈S,y+1i∈Sor
(ii) there exists some j∈{1,2,..., n}such that xj<yj,x−1i+1j∈S, and
y+1i−1j∈S,
where 1idenotes the ith unit vector for i=1,2,..., n. It is known that the Minkowski sum
of M♮-convex sets is M♮-convex ([11, Theorem 6.15], [13, Theorem 3.13]). The follo wing
theorem states this fact.
Theorem 2.1. The Minkowski sum W =S1+S2+···+Smof M♮-convex sets S i⊆Zn
(i=1,2,..., m)is an M♮-convex set.
Corollary 2.2. For the Minkowski sum W =S1+S2+···+Smof M♮-convex sets S i⊆Zn
(i=1,2,..., m), we have W∩Zn=W.
Proof. W is an M♮-convex set by Theorem 2.1. Any M♮-convex set is an integrally convex
set, for which (2.5) holds. /square
Another subclass of integrally convex sets, called L♮-convex sets, is deﬁned as follows. A
(nonempty) set S⊆Znis called an L♮-convex if it enjoys discrete midpoint convexity:
x,y∈S=⇒/ceilingleftbiggx+y
2/ceilingrightbigg
,/floorleftbiggx+y
2/floorrightbigg
∈S.
4The Minkowski sum of two L♮-convex sets is not necessarily L♮-convex but it is integrally
convex [11, Theorem 8.42]. It is also noted that the Minkowsk i sum of three L♮-convex sets
is no longer integrally convex (Example 3.2). See [13, Secti on 3.5] for the Minkowski sum
operation for other kinds of discrete convex sets.
3 Results
In this section we present our main results, the Shapley–Fol kman-type theorems for integrally
convex sets, M♮-convex sets, and L♮-convex sets. To state the theorems we need to deﬁne
functions

n·min( n,m), (3.1)
where nis the dimension of the space and mis the number of Minkowski summands. The
proofs are given in Section 4.
Theorem 3.1. Let S i⊆Zn(i=1,2,..., m)be integrally convex sets and W =S1+S2+
···+Sm, where n≥2. For any x∈W, there exists z∈W that satisﬁes/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤α(n,m). If
x∈W∩Zn, in particular, then /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤⌊α(n,m)⌋=min( n,m)−1.
Theorem 3.2. Let S i⊆Zn(i=1,2,..., m)be integrally convex sets and W =S1+S2+···+
Sm, where n≥1. For any x∈W, there exists z∈W that satisﬁes/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l2≤β(n,m)(and
hence/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤β(n,m)). If x∈W∩Zn, in particular, then /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤⌊β(n,m)⌋.
Example 3.1. In Figure 1 (Example 2.1), we have n=2,m=2,α(n,m)=β(n,m)=1.
Forx=(1,1)∈S1+S2, which is a ‘hole,’ we can take z=(1,0)∈S1+S2satisfying
/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤1.
A combination of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 implies that, for any x∈W, there exists z∈W
that satisﬁes
/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤min{α(n,m),β(n,m)} (n≥2,m≥1); (3.2)
ifx∈W∩Zn, in particular, then
/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤min{⌊α(n,m)⌋,⌊β(n,m)⌋} (n≥2,m≥1). (3.3)
The following proposition determines which is smaller betw eenα(n,m) andβ(n,m) de-
pending on ( n,m). The proof is given in Section 4.3. Roughly speaking, α(n,m) is smaller
when mis small, andβ(n,m) is smaller when mis large.
Proposition 3.3.
(1)Case of n=2:α(2,m)=β(2,m)=1for all m≥2.
(2)Case of m=1:α(n,1)<β(n,1)for all n≥2.
(3)Case of m≥2:α(n,m)>β(n,m)if3≤n≤4m−3, andα(n,m)<β(n,m)if n≥4m−2.
5The values of⌊α(n,m)⌋and⌊β(n,m)⌋used in (3.3) for an integral point xare shown below.
For each ( n,m), the smaller of the two is in boldface.
m=1 m=2 m=3 m=4 m=5

n=12 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 3
n=16 0 2 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4
The particular case of Theorem 3.1 for m=1 is worthy of attention. For m=1, we
haveα(n,1)=1−1/nforn≥2, and hence⌊α(n,1)⌋=0 for all n≥2. The latter (i.e.,
⌊α(n,1)⌋=0) corresponds to the fact that S=S∩Znfor an integrally convex set S. A
combination of the former (i.e., α(n,1)=1−1/n) with Theorem 2.1 results in a sharp bound
for the case of M♮-convex summands Si.
Theorem 3.4. Let S i⊆Zn(i=1,2,..., m)be M♮-convex sets and W =S1+S2+···+Sm,
where n≥2. For any x∈W, there exists z∈W that satisﬁes/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤1−1/n.
Proof. Since the Minkowski sum of M♮-convex sets remains to be M♮-convex (Theorem 2.1),
Wis an M♮-convex set, and hence it is an integrally convex set. By Theo rem 3.1 with m=1,
there exists z∈Wthat satisﬁes/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤α(n,1)=1−1/n. /square
For L♮-convex summands Siwe can derive the following bounds immediately from The-
orems 3.1 and 3.2.
Theorem 3.5. Let S i⊆Zn(i=1,2,..., m)be L♮-convex sets, W=S1+S2+···+Sm, and
x∈W, where n≥2.
(1)There exists z∈W that satisﬁes/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤α(n,⌈m/2⌉). If x∈W∩Zn, then/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤
⌊α(n,⌈m/2⌉)⌋=min( n,⌈m/2⌉)−1.
(2)There exists z∈W that satisﬁes/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l2≤β(n,⌈m/2⌉). If x∈W∩Zn, then/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤
⌊β(n,⌈m/2⌉)⌋.
(3)There exists z∈W that satisﬁes/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤min{α(n,⌈m/2⌉),β(n,⌈m/2⌉)}. If x∈W∩Zn,
then/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤min{⌊α(n,⌈m/2⌉)⌋,⌊β(n,⌈m/2⌉)⌋}.
Proof. By [11, Theorem 8.42], the Minkowski sum of two L♮-convex sets is integrally con-
vex (though not L♮-convex). This allows us to replace mby⌈m/2⌉in the upper bounds in
Theorems 3.1 and 3.2. /square
Example 3.2 ([14, Example 4.12]) .Consider three L♮-convex sets S1={(0,0,0),(1,1,0)},
S2={(0,0,0),(0,1,1)}, and S3={(0,0,0),(1,0,1)}. Their Minkowski sum S=S1+S2+S3
is given by S={(0,0,0),(0,1,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(2,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,2,1),(2,2,2)}, which
has a hole (1,1,1)∈S\S. Theorem 3.1 (with n=3,m=3) gives a bound/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤2,
whereas a better bound /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤1 is obtained from Theorem 3.5 (1).
Remark 3.1. A recent paper by Nguyen–V ohra [16] gives an interesting var iant of the Shapley–
Folkman theorem. A polytope Pwith vertices in{0,1}nis called∆-uniform if each of its
edges, which is a{−1,0,1}vector, has at most ∆positive and at most ∆negative coordinates.
6The theorem of Nguyen and V ohra (to be called “Theorem NV” her e) implies the follow-
ing: Let Si(i=1,2,..., m) be subsets of{0,1}nsuch that each Siis∆-uniform, and let
W=S1+S2+···+Sm. For any x∈W, there exists z∈Wthat satisﬁes/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞<2∆−1.
Ifx∈W∩Zn, then/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤2∆−2.
The following comparisons may be made between Theorem NV and our results.
•Theorem NV captures a property of the summand sets Si⊆{0,1}nin terms of a param-
eter∆related to edge vectors, and gives a bound on /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞using∆, independent of n
andm. In contrast, Theorem 3.1 exploits no speciﬁc properties. R ecall that any subset
of{0,1}nis integrally convex.
•For arbitrary summand sets Si⊆{0,1}n, we can take∆= n. For x∈W, Theorem NV
gives/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞<2n−1, whereas Theorem 3.1 gives /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤α(n,m)=(1−
1/n) min( n,m). We have 2 n−1>α(n,m) for all n≥2 and m≥1.
•When each summand Siis an M♮-convex set contained in {0,1}n(e.g., arising from the
independent sets of a matroid), we have ∆=1 and Theorem NV gives /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞<1 for
x∈Wand/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞=0 for x∈W∩Zn, whereas Theorem 3.4 gives /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤1−1/n
forx∈W(when n≥2) and Corollary 2.2 shows /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞=0 for x∈W∩Zn.
•When each summand Siis an L♮-convex set contained in {0,1}n, we have∆= n. For
x∈W, Theorem NV gives /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞<2n−1, whereas Theorem 3.5(1) gives /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤
α(n,⌈m/2⌉) (when n≥2). We have 2 n−1>α(n,⌈m/2⌉) for all n≥2 and m≥1.
4 Proofs
4.1 Proofs of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2
In this section we prove the main theorems (Theorems 3.1 and 3 .2) of this paper. For the
proof of Theorem 3.1, we need the following lemma concerning a subset of{0,1}nin general,
which may be useful in some other contexts.
Lemma 4.1. Let S⊆{0,1}n, where n≥2. For any x∈S , there exists v∗∈S that satisﬁes
/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−v∗/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤1−1
n. (4.1)
Proof. The proof is given in Section 4.2. /square
Remark 4.1. The bound/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−v∗/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤1−1/nin Lemma 4.1 is tight. For example, for
S={1i|i=1,2,..., n}={(1,0,0,..., 0,0),(0,1,0,..., 0,0),..., (0,0,0,..., 0,1)}and
x=(1/n,1/n,..., 1/n)∈S, we have/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−v/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞=1−1/nfor all v∈S.
We can prove Theorem 3.1 as follows. Since
x∈S1+S2+···+Sm=S1+S2+···+Sm,
the vector xcan be represented as a sum of some elements of S1,S2,..., Sm. That is,
x=m/summationdisplay
i=1yi(4.2)
7for some yi∈Si(i=1,2,..., m). Let
Ti=Si∩N(yi) (4.3)
fori=1,2,..., m, where N( yi) is the integral neighborhood of yideﬁned in (2.1). Since each
Siis integrally convex, we may use (2.4) to obtain yi∈Si∩N(yi)=Ti. Then (4.2) shows
x∈T1+T2+···+Tm.
By Theorem 1.2 (Shapley–Folkman’s lemma) there exists I⊆ {1,2,..., m}such that
|I|≤min( n,m) and x∈/summationtext
i∈ITi+/summationtext
j∈JTj, where J={1,2,..., m}\I. Therefore,
x=/summationdisplay
i∈Ixi+/summationdisplay
j∈Jzj
for some xi∈Ti(i∈I) and zj∈Tj(j∈J). Lemma 4.1 implies that, for each i∈I, there
exists vi∈Tisatisfying/⌊ar⌈⌊lxi−vi/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤1−1/n. Deﬁne
z=/summationdisplay
i∈Ivi+/summationdisplay
j∈Jzj,
which belongs to T1+T2+···+Tm(⊆S1+S2+···+Sm=W). We then have
/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞=/⌊ar⌈⌊l/summationdisplay
i∈I(xi−vi)/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤/summationdisplay
i∈I/⌊ar⌈⌊lxi−vi/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤/parenleftigg
1−1
n/parenrightigg
|I|≤α(n,m).
Finally, if x∈W∩Zn, we haveZ∋/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤α(n,m), whereas⌊α(n,m)⌋=min( n,m)−1.
This completes the proof of Theorem 3.1.
The proof of Theorem 3.2 is as follows. Each Tiin (4.3) is contained in a translated unit
cube, that is, Ti⊆ai+{0,1}nfor some ai∈Zn, from which follows that r(Ti)≤rad(Ti)≤√n/2 for i=1,2,..., m. Hence we can take L=√n/2 in Theorem 1.1 (Shapley–Folkman–
Starr theorem), to obtain
/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l2≤L/radicalbig
min( n,m)=(√n/2)/radicalbig
min( n,m)=β(n,m).
Finally, if x∈W∩Zn, we haveZ∋/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l2≤β(n,m), from which/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−z/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤
⌊β(n,m)⌋. Thus Theorem 3.2 is proved.
4.2 Proof of Lemma 4.1
In this section we prove Lemma 4.1, which states that for any x∈S, there exists v∗∈S
satisfying/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−v∗/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤1−1/nin (4.1). Let N={1,2,..., n}. Without loss of generality, we
may assume that xi≥1/2 for all i∈N. (If I={i∈N|xi<1/2}is nonempty, change xito
1−xifor all i∈I, and change Ssimilarly.) Represent xas a convex combination of the points

Claim 1: Ifλv≥1/nfor some v∈S, then/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−v/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤1−1/nfor such v.
(Proof of Claim 1) Since

To prove (4.1) by contradiction, we assume

j/nequal∅for each j=1,2,..., n−1 (with the convention of S1
0=S).
At the ﬁnal stage, we show that S1
n−1/nequal∅leads to a contradiction to (4.4).
The ﬁrst partition S=S0
1∪S1
1is deﬁned as follows. By (4.4) there exists i1∈Nand
u∈Ssatisfying|xi1−ui1|>1−1/n, where ui1=0 since xi1≥1/2 by our assumption. Thus
we have
xi1>1−1
n. (4.5)
With reference to the component i1, we classify the vectors in Sinto two subsets:
S0
1={v∈S|vi1=0},S1
1={v∈S|vi1=1}. (4.6)
Since xi1=/summationtext
v∈S1

/summationdisplay
v∈S1
1λv>1−1
n,/summationdisplay
v∈S0
1λv<1
n. (4.7)
In particular, S1
1/nequal∅. It also follows from (4.5) that
For every v∈S1
1:|xi1−vi1|=1−xi1<1
n≤1−1
n, (4.8)
where n≥2 is used. Let S1
0=S.
Claim 2: For j=1,2,..., n−1, we can choose an index ij∈N\{i1,i2,..., ij−1}which
deﬁnes a partition of S1
j−1into two parts
S0
j={v∈S1
j−1|vij=0},S1
j={v∈S1

n. (4.12)
(Proof of Claim 2) For j=1 we have (4.9)–(4.12) from (4.5)–(4.8). Assuming we have
chosen i1,i2,..., ij(where j<n−1) satisfying (4.9)–(4.12), we choose the next index ij+1
as follows. For each v∈S1
jwe have|xik−vik|≤1−1/nfork=1,2,..., jby (4.11) while
/⌊ar⌈⌊lx−v/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞>1−1/nby (4.4). Hence there exists ij+1∈N\{i1,i2,..., ij}andu∈S1
jsatisfying
|xij+1−uij+1|>1−1/n, where uij+1=0 since xij+1≥1/2 by our assumption. Thus we obtain
xij+1>1−1
n, (4.13)
which is (4.10) for j+1. With the use of this ij+1we deﬁne a partition S1
j=S0
j+1∪S1

(4.9) for j+1. Then S=(S0

The second inequality of (4.12) for j+1 follows from (4.15). In (4.14) we have/summationtext

Thus we obtain/summationdisplay

which is the ﬁrst inequality of (4.12) for j+1. For every v∈S1
j+1we have (4.13) and vij+1=1,
from which we obtain
|xij+1−vij+1|=1−xij+1<1
n≤1−1
n,
showing (4.11) for j+1. (End of proof of Claim 2)
By (4.12) for j=n−1, we have S1
n−1/nequal∅. Since S1
n−1⊆S1
jfor all j≤n−1, any
v∈S1
n−1has the property that vik=1 for k=1,2,..., n−1, and vin∈{0,1}. IfS1
n−1contains
v∗=(1,1,..., 1), this vector satisﬁes /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−v∗/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤1−1/n, since
|xij−v∗
ij|=1−xij≤1−1
n(j=1,2,..., n−1)
10by (4.11) and
|xin−v∗
in|=1−xin≤1
2≤1−1
n.
This contradicts (4.4). Otherwise, S1
n−1consists of a unique element u∗with u∗
in=0 and u∗
i=1
fori/nequalin. By the ﬁrst inequality of (4.12) for j=n−1 we haveλu∗>1−(n−1)/n=1/n,
which, by Claim 1, implies /⌊ar⌈⌊lx−u∗/⌊ar⌈⌊l∞≤1−1/n, which is also a contradiction to (4.4). The
proof of Lemma 4.1 is thus completed.
4.3 Proof of Proposition 3.3
In this section we prove Proposition 3.3 to determine which i s smaller between α(n,m) and
β(n,m).
(1) When n=2 and m≥2, we have
α(2,m)=/parenleftigg
1−1
2/parenrightigg
min(2,m)=1, β (2,m)=1
2/radicalbig
2·min(2,m)=1.
(2) When m=1 and n≥2, we have
α(n,1)=/parenleftigg
1−1
n/parenrightigg
min( n,1)=1−1
n, β (n,1)=1
2/radicalbig
n·min( n,1)=1
2√n.
When n=2, we haveα(2,1)=1/2,β(2,1)=√
2/2=0.7..., and henceα(2,1)<β(2,1).
When n=3, we haveα(3,1)=2/3,β(3,1)=√
3/2=0.86..., and henceα(3,1)<β(3,1).
When n≥4, we haveα(n,1)<1,β(n,1)=1
2√n≥1, and henceα(n,1)<β(n,1).
(3) The claim is concerned with the cases with m≥2 and n≥3. The combination of
Case A and Case B below covers all such cases.
Case A: When n≥3 and n≤m, we have
α(n,m)=/parenleftigg
1−1
n/parenrightigg
n=n−1, β (n,m)=1
2√n·n=n
2.
Therefore,α(n,m)>β(n,m).
Case B: When n≥3,m≥2, and m<n, we have
α(n,m)=/parenleftigg
1−1
n/parenrightigg
m, β (n,m)=1
2√n·m.
Therefore, we have
α<β⇔/parenleftigg
1−1
n/parenrightigg
m<1
2√n·m⇔√m<√n
21
1−1/n⇔m<n3
4(n−1)2. (4.16)
Deﬁne
θ(n)=n3
4(n−1)2. (4.17)
Sinceθ(n) is not an integer for any integer n≥3, we have thatα/nequalβfor all ( n,m), and that
α<β⇔m<θ(n), α>β⇔m>θ(n). (4.18)
Case B-1: When n=3, we haveθ(3)=27/16=1.6875, and henceα(3,2)>β(3,2) by
(4.18). Note that{m∈Z|m≥2,m<n}consists of m=2 only.
11Case B-2: When n=4, we haveθ(4)=16/9=1.77..., and henceα(4,m)>β(4,m) for
m=2,3. Note that{m∈Z|m≥2,m<n}consists of m=2,3 only.
Case B-3: When n≥5, the threshold value θ(n) can be estimated as
n+2
4<n3
4(n−1)2<n+3
4(n≥5). (4.19)
Indeed, the ﬁrst inequality of (4.19) holds since
n+2
4<n3
4(n−1)2⇔(n+2)(n−1)2<n3⇔3n>2,
and the second inequality of (4.19) follows from
n3
4(n−1)2<n+3
4⇔n3<(n+3)(n−1)2⇔n2−5n+3>0
andn2−5n+3=n(n−5)+3>0. It follows from (4.18) and (4.19) that
α<β ifn≥5,2≤m≤(n+2)/4,
α>β ifn≥5,(n+3)/4≤m<n,
or equivalently,
α<β ifn≥5,2≤m,n≥4m−2,
α>β ifn≥5,2≤m<n≤4m−3.
This completes the proof of Proposition 3.3.
