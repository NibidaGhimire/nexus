Abstract  
Fermi arc s on Weyl semimetals exhibit many exotic quantum phenomen a. Usually considered  
on atomically -flat surfac es with approximate translation symmetry , Fermi arcs are rooted in 
peculiar topology of bulk Bloch bands of three -dimensional (3D)  crystal s. The fundamental 
question of whether a 1D Fermi arc can be probed remains unanswered. Such answer could  
significantl y broaden potential applications of Weyl semimetals . Here, we report a direct 
observation of robust edge states on atomic -scale ledges in TaAs using low -temperature 
scanning tunneling microscopy /spectroscopy. Spectroscopic signatures and theoretical 
calculations reveal  that the 1D Fermi arcs arise from the chiral Weyl points of bulk crystal. 
The crossover from 2D Fermi arc s to eventual complete localization on 1D edges was arrested 
experimentally on a sequence of surfaces. Our results demonstrate extreme robustness of the 2 
 bulk-boundary correspondence , which offers topological protection for Fermi arcs, even in 
cases in which the boundaries are down to atomic -scale. The persistent 1D Fermi arcs can be 
profitably exploited in miniaturized quantum devices.

MAIN  TEXT  
 
Introduction  
Exploring the exotic properties of quasiparticles in topological matters is of great interest in 
condensed -matter physics [1–3]. Weyl semimetals have been theoretically proposed [4–6] and 
experimentally confirmed [7–13] as an important gapless topological system, which harbor s 
pairs of Weyl points with opposite chiralit y. As a periodic cross section of the Brillouin zone 
(BZ) moves across a Weyl point, the Chern number changes from 0 to 1, and back to 0 as it 
continues across the other Weyl point of the opposite topological cha rge[6,14] . Consequently , 
the 2D cross sections betwee n a pair of Weyl points can be viewed as a continuous k-space 
stack of Chern insulators, leaving a streak of chiral edge states on the surface , forming Fermi 
arc states [5,15] . In a number of natural gaples s crystals, Fermi arc surface states have been 
identified on surface s with connecting chiral Weyl points [4–12,16 –21]. The (001) face in 
TaAs is a representative  example of what is termed  an arc-allowed surface (AAS) [6–
8,13,20,21] , as schematically shown in Fig. 1A. On the other hand, on an achiral surface on 
which  the projections in the 2D surface BZ of the Weyl points coincide, topological Fermi 
arcs are not expected to exist [6], and these are referred to as an arc-forbidden surface (AFS).  
TaAs s urfaces with Miller indices (100) and ( 110) are AFSs ; whereas , (112) and (114) 
surfaces (see Fig. 1A) , depart ing from the (110) AFS , can host the projection of chiral Weyl 
points . These surfaces  have not yet been experim entally investigated  from a Weyl physics 
perspective .  
Evidently, the Fermi arcs of a Weyl semimetal, and their presence or absence, are derived 
from the peculiar topology of the Bloch bands of the bulk crystal,  which inherently assumes 
an ideal, infinite crystalline system [14]. Although, in practice , one expects the Bloch band 3 
 picture to hold for finite crystals with finite surfaces comprised of a large number of unit cells, 
the fate of Fermi arcs in structures down to atomic -scale, such as a step ledge, has yet to b e 
examined experimentally. Here, we report a direct observation of one -dimensional (1D) edge 
states associated with Fermi arcs residing at the step edges on an AFS of a TaAs crystal, as 
well as  on AASs with weak Fermi arc surface states. These edge states can be viewed as 
topological Fermi arcs that survive persistently on atomic -scale 1D step ledges, at which the 
Bloch theorem is not expected to apply. Spectroscopic signatures from a sequence of surfaces 
gradually departing from AAS (001) to approach AFS ( 110) show that the Fermi arcs undergo 
a continuous crossover from 2D surface states, to eventually complete localization on 1D step 
edges. Our results indicate that the bulk-boundary correspondence  that protects the Fermi arc 
states is more ubiquitous than  recognized previously. Indeed, t hese topologically -protected 
states exist not only on 2D surfaces, but also on 1D  step edges, the latter of which can be used 
to create interesting 1D quantum devices or a Weyl semimetal single crystal with 
contiguously -covered topological surface states.  
Results and discussion  
A seque nce of atomic ally-flat surface s with different Miller indices in high -quality TaAs 
single crystals was measured comprehensively at 4.2 K in a commercial STM system 
(UNISOKU -1300) (see Materi als and Methods). Tunneling spectra and differential 
conductance ( dI/dV ) mappings reveal uniform 1D edge states at the step edge of the (110) 
and the (112) surfaces . However, no signature of such edge states was observed at the steps 
on the (001) and the ( 114) surfaces . The particular spatial and energy distributions can 
distinguis h these unique states from common trivial edge states originating from defects , such 
as dangling bonds. The correspondence between the experimental results and the theoretical 
calculations show  that the observed edge states originate from the localization of Fermi arcs 
at the step edges.   
Discovery of 1D edge states on cleaved (112) surface  
We start ed from  an atomically -flat, pristine  (112) surface prepared by  in-situ cleaving . A 
3D topographic STM image , exhibiting  long and straight  step edges , is shown in Fig. 1B. 
Each terrace step is found to be one -atom high, i.e., approximately  2.4 Å. Fig. 1C shows an 
atomically -resolved  topographic image of the top terrace, which agrees precisely with the 
configuration of (112). The step edge is along  the [13̅1] direction, which is the intersection 
between the (112) and the (1̅14) crystal facets , and has an inclination angle of approximately  
52o from [ 1̅10] (right panel in Fig. 1C). Tunneling spectroscopy was performed on selected 4 
 points near a step edge , as marked  in Fig. 1B. As shown in Fig. 1D, a clear  peak near the 
Fermi level in the spectra appears  proximal to the  step edge, in comparison with the spectra 
that are far from the line step (local density of state (LDOS) on the 2D surface), suggesting 
localized electronic states near the step edge. In the tunneling conductance mapping presented  
in Fig. 1E, data were collected on the same area as shown  in Fig. 1B with various  bias voltages. 
Trivial dangling bonds states can be observed, although mainly confined on the edge atoms 
around -200 meV and 250 meV. Of special interest are those uniform st ates next to the step 
edges at the energy of 55 me V, which correspond to near -zero energy peaks , as indicated by 
the dotted green line in Fig. 1D. Distinguished from the trivial edge states, these localized 
edge states disperse from the step to the surface  with a width over ~ 1 nm in real space. Further 
analyses  will demonstrate that these are , in fact , remnant s of Fermi arcs, although these 
measurements are taken on an AFS.  The above findings are highly interesting, since extant  
theoretical works have pred icted that Fermi arcs can appear as localized states at 1D step 
edges in a 3D Weyl system [22,23] . We will focus on spectroscopic evidence  for these 1D 
Femi arc states in this paper.  
1D edge states originate from  topological Fermi arcs  
To elucidate  the origin of the 1D edge states  and their possible connection  to 2D Fermi 
arcs, we systematically investigate surface states on a sequence of planes  (1,1,2𝑛), of 
which 𝑛=0 is AFS (110), 𝑛=∞ is AAS (001), and 𝑛=1,2 denote s the nearest 
surfaces that depart from (110), i.e., (112)  and (114) , as shown in Fig. 1A. The STM 
topographic image captured on the surfaces  reveal a number of atomically -flat facets. By 
comparing it with the structural models shown in Figs. 2A -C, a number of highly -crystalline 
facets are identified to be (110),  (112) and (114) planes, all containing [1̅10] step edges, as 
shown in Figs. 2D -F. The [1̅10] step edge  is parallel to the (001) AAS surface , and has a 
height of several atoms. In the following, we will examine the signal of Fermi arcs on these 
facets.  
Fig. 3B shows the selected tunneling conductance ( dI/dV ) spectra along t he arrow -dotted 
line in Fig. 3A on the AFS (110) facet as the tip approaches the [1̅10] step edge. Non -zero 
LDOS at the Fermi level indicates the ( semi-) metallic nature of the surface. The tunneling 
spectrum taken far away from the step, representing the 2D surface states, exhibits  a small 
dip near the Fermi level. As the probe was moved toward the step edge, the dip in the 
tunneling spectrum gradual ly disappears while a peak grows steadily near the Fermi level. 5 
 Fig. 3C shows the spatial STS along the dashed arrow line in Fig. 3A. The red line indicates  
the position and the profile of the step edge. Prominent STS features corresponding to the 
peaked D OS are observed next to the step edge with a dispersion width in real space. STS 
mappings with selected bi as voltages  are presented in Fig. 3D. The trivial edge states that 
originate from the dangling bonds can be observed at -80 meV, which are precisely c onfined 
on the edge atoms. The peaked edge states at -20 meV (peaked DOS in STS) , however,  spread 
over a whole unit cell along  the 𝑐⃗ direction into the surface. The dispersion width 
corresponds perfectly to the dispersion depth of Fermi arc surface states  on AAS (001) 
[13](Fig. S1 ), and can be considered as the profile of the Fermi arc surface states of an atomic 
(001) ledg e. This result  further suggests the topological origin of the edge states [24,25] .  
To understand the origin of the emergent peak in STS spectra near the step edge, 
electronic structure calculations were carried out  to describe the low -energy excitations of t he 
step edge in question. A slab model with terraced surfaces on the top and bottom  was used , 
with Miller indices (𝑛,𝑛,2) (Materials and Methods,  and Supplementary  Materials ). The 
flat region on the terrace has a width of 𝑛|𝑐⃗|, with the (001) plane (As -terminated for top and 
Ta-terminated for bottom) exposed at the step ledges with a height of unit cell |𝑎⃗+𝑏⃗⃗|. The 
Ta-As chains propagate along the [ 1̅10] direction (cf. Fig. 2A). Based on a tight -binding 
Hamiltonian obtained from density -functional theoretic calculations, surface Green’s 
functions were obtained with an iterative technique to yield surface spectral function for direct 
comparison with the tunneling spectra [26].  
For the model described above, the flat region is the (110) AFS, and consequently one 
expects to see topological states  only near the step edges, which corresponds precisely  to the 
experimenta l finding. The spectral functions 𝐴(𝑘,𝜀) on (𝑛,𝑛,2) (𝑛=6 in Fig. 3E) for 
𝜀=−20 meV on the top surface are displayed in Fig. 3F. It can be seen  that both Fermi arcs 
and trivial Fermi s urfaces are present in the surface BZ. Moreover, t he Fermi arcs can be 
observed in the energy range between -5 meV to -30 meV with their maximum intensity at -
20 meV, which corresponds to the peaked  DOS  in the spectra signatures ( see Fig. S 6). To 
determine  the spatial location of the Fermi arcs on the terraced surface with a width over 7 
nm (12 Ta -As chains), we chose  one of the Fermi arcs that is clearly isolated from other 
surface states , and computed its projection on different Ta -As chains as labeled in  Fig. 3E on 
the terraced slab model, which are depicted in Figs. 3F and G. Other visible arcs on the top 
and the bottom surfaces at 𝜀=−20 meV are shown in Fig. S5. It is evident that the spectral 6 
 weight of the Fermi arcs is most pronounced at the step edg e, and decreases steadily as the 
distance from the step increases (Figs. 3G and H). The calculation results support the 
existence of the 1D Fermi arc edge states at the step edge on the (110) surface, which disperse 
from the edge to the surface with a widt h of ~ 1 nm in real space.  
Crossover from 2D Fermi arc states to 1D Fermi arc edge states  
The atomically -resolved STM topography of (112) in Fig. 2E shows relaxation of surface 
atoms induced by the annealing process (Fig. S3). Fig. 4A presents  the STM  topographic 
surface plates (112) with steps. The height profile across the surface shows that the height of 
the small step ledge is approximately  0.85 nm (four atomic -layers). In addition, t he small 
ledge is  along [ 1̅10] and terminate s on the (001) surface , which permits the existence of Fermi 
arc surface states . For the tunneling spectra acquired far from the step edge, a small shoulder 
is observed in the curves at a bias energy of -20 meV. When the STM tip approaches the step 
edge, the shoulder evolves in to a pronounced peak in the dI/dV  spectra in the energy range 
between -20 meV to 20 meV (Fig. 4B). The near -zero energy peaks are distinguishable from 
the trivial edge states which are  precisely confined on the edge atoms (Fig. 4B). They also 
spread over several atoms on both sides of the step (Fig. 4B ), and even disperse across the 
narrow terrace R2 (~ 1.3 nm) (Fig. 4B). The 1D edge states revealed by  the near -zero energy 
peaks can be clearly seen in the spatial revolved dI/dV  along the step edges (Fig. 4C). The 
peak positions near the steps are spatially steady and essentially energy -independent ( i.e., 
without interference patterns) , as shown in Fig 4C . The lack of interference rules o ut the 
possibility that the standing wave originated from the scattered electrons on the steps [24]. 
A slab model with terraced (𝑛,𝑛,2𝑛+1) surfaces on the top (As -terminated) and 
bottom (Ta -terminated) surfaces  was also constructed to illustrate the 1D edge states on the 
(112) terrace. The level region on the terrace has a width of 𝑛|𝑐⃗−𝑎⃗−𝑏⃗⃗| (𝑛=4, width ~5 
nm), with the (001) surface exp osed at the atomic -thick step ledge with a height of unit cell 
|𝑏⃗⃗|, as schematically illustrated  in Fig. 4D. The spectral functions 𝐴(𝑘⃗⃗,𝜀) of the terraced 
surface for 𝜀=−20 meV on the top surface (bottom surface in Fig. S 8) are displayed in Fig. 
4E. The visible Fermi arcs were selected (in Fig. 4E) to calculate  the projection weight on 
Ta-As chains as labeled in Fig. 4D. The spectral weight exhibits  pronounced localization at 
the step edge (Fig. 4F), which accounts for the observed 1D edge states in Figs. 4B and C.  
Noticeably, it decreases more slowly than that on the (110) terrace as the distance from the 
step increase s, indicating  the existence of 2D topological Fermi arc surface states. 7 
 Remarkably,  the 1D Fermi arc edge states appear  to coexist  with the 2D Fermi arc surface 
states  in this case .  
The Fermi arc states in Weyl semimetals, protected by the peculiar topology of the Bloch 
bands of the bulk crystal, are robust against weak surface perturba tions [14,20,27] . Here, we 
examine how the near -zero energy  edge states respond to  local perturbation . In Fig. 4A, the 
whole region is divided into three areas, R1, R2 and R3, of which their width is R1 (~8 nm) > 
R3(~2 nm) > R2(~1.3 nm). The metallicity (surface DOS intensity) of each area revealed by 
spectroscopic signatures  follows the relationship: R1 > R3 > R2 ( Fig. 4G). The peak in the 
1D edge states is robust and only scarcely affected when the change of the surface size and 
metallicity are considered as weak perturbations.  Moreover, the peak also shows protection 
against the weak disorder of local defects.  Two kinks induced by the edge parallel translation  
can be discerned , as shown in Fig. 4A. We took dI/dV  curves spatially at each point as 
numbered from No. 1 to 22 with minimal separation distance (~0.15 nm) along the step. The 
left panel in Fig. 4H presents the possible atomic configuration of the edge in accordance with 
that in Fig. 4A. C onfiguration  of the dangling bond s in the kinks is different (position s No. 
5-8 and No. 16 -19), in the sense that the kinks can be considered as disorders or point defects 
to disturb the LDOS. If the 1D edge states were of trivial origins, the corresponding peaks 
should be changed  by local defects. However, no substantial cha nges in the spatial revolved 
dI/dV  spectra at each numbered point (right panel in Fig. H)  is found , whic h lends further 
support to its top ological nature.  
The s urface plane of (114) with a step edge along [ 1̅10] (Fig. 5A) is the last member of 
the sequence that we prepared . The (114) surface exhibits  a decreased inclination angle (~50o) 
in respect to the AAS (001). The surface states on (114) have been detected. Although the 
LDOS at Fermi level increases slightly as the STM tip approach es the step edge, no extra -
peaked STS features can be seen near the step edge (Fig. 5B). In the spatial spectra results 
(Fig. 5C), th e dangling bond states can be observed on the Ta -As chains at energy above the 
Fermi level, and increased DOS are also seen on the inclined ledge. However , no uniform 1D 
edge states with possible topological origin can be discerned . Our theoretical calcula tions on 
(114) demonstrate that Fermi arcs distribute all over the surface, and the projections of Fermi 
arcs on all Ta -As chains are of comparable weight (Figs. 5E -G). This suggests that the 2D 
Fermi arc surface states dominat e the topological information  on the (114) surface , which is 
similar to the  (001) surface with steps where  no topological edge states exist owing to the 2D 
Fermi arc all over the surface (Fig. S2). This confirms the expectation that , as the surface 8 
 becomes  closer to AAS (001) , the spectroscopic signature of the surface states increasingly 
resembles that obtain ed on the (001) surface.  The above results also verify  that, when the 
surface indices are  gradually departing from AFS (110) and approaching AAS (001),  the 
Fermi arcs undergo a continuous crossover from 1D edge states to completely 2D topological 
surface s tates.  
In Fig. 1, it can be seen that  plane (11 2) has t he step edge along  [13̅1]. Since [13̅1] can 
be viewed as a ledge of AAS ( 1̅14) where Fermi arc surface states exist , the chiral  Weyl  
points  have  a finite weight project ed on the ledge , and consequently the  1D Fermi arc edge 
states appear at  the step edge . In aggregate , the results further confirm that the 1D Fermi arc 
states exist ubiquitously  in 3D Weyl crystal step edges.  
Conclusions  
In this work , we not only observed 1D Fermi arc edge states , but also explored the 
evolution of  Fermi arc states . In TaAs crystal , the (110) and (001) facets are perpendicular to 
each other. When a step is formed by the (110) surface (AFS) and the (001) ledge (a finite 
AAS), the Fermi arcs can only appe ar on the AAS ledge with a certain penetration depth on 
the AFS, which therefore forms localized Fermi arc states on the edge . As the surface index 
changes, however, an evolution of the Fermi arc states can be observed from our calculations. 
To elucidate  the evolution of Fermi arc states, we examined the steps ’ form by the (1,1,2𝑛) 
surface with the (001) ledge. For 𝑛=0, the surface is the AFS (110), and for 𝑛=∞ the 
surface is the AAS (001). As shown in Fig. 4  where 𝑛=1, the step is formed by two AASs 
(112) and (001),  and the Fermi arcs can surviv e on both facets . Therefore, on the (112) facet 
of the step, the coexisten ce of 2D Fermi arc surface states and 1D Fermi arc edge states can 
be observed  simultaneously  in the calculated results in  Fig. 4F. By increasing the index 𝑛, 
the surface (1,1,2𝑛) approaches  the surface (001) , and the 2D Fermi arc surface states on 
the (1,1,2𝑛) facet become more prominent. In the case of  𝑛=2 (Fig. 5 ), the step is 
formed by two AASs (114) and (001), and the 2D Fermi arc surface states dominate on the  
top (114) facet . 
Overall , the STM/STS measurements and the theoretical calculations performed in this 
work demonstrate that 1D topological Fermi arc states widely exist on atomic step edges, 
which can be conceptually viewed as the projection of chiral Weyl points in the bulk of Weyl 
semimetal TaAs. In addition, t he 1D Fermi arc edge states undergo a continuous crossover to 
the 2D surface states as the surface gradually depart s from an AFS and approach es an AAS, 9 
 and both the 1D and the 2D Fermi arc states may coexist in the process. The results reveal 
that the bulk -boundary correspondence in 3D Weyl semimetals remains at work  even when 
the boundary is  down to the atomic -scale.  
 
Materials and Methods  
Details of the sample preparation:  High -quality single crystals of TaAs were grown by the 
standard chemical vapor transport method , as described in [28]. For the processed TaAs 
samples: the surface was polished by abrasive papers after the (110) surface was demarcated 
by Laue diffraction. Then, the sample was transferred into an ultra-high vacuum chamber and 
repeat edly sputtered by Ar+ ions with energy 500 eV. The annealing process was carried out 
on the sample by electron beam heating with a temperature of approximately  950 oC for 30 
min under a vacuum of 10-9 Torr. For the cleaved samples: the thickness of synthetic TaAs 
crystals ((001) plane) was polished down to approximately  300 μm with abrasive papers 
from both sides. It was fixed to the sample holder for cleavage on the (110) plane. Cleavage 
of the sample  was carried out in-situ in a high vacuum chamber (2.5 ×10-10 Torr) at room 
temperature, with a cleav ing knife equipped in the Unisoku -1300 STM/STS system. After the 
cleavage , the sample was transferred without interrupting the high vacuum into the STM 
cham ber. After numerous  rounds of trial and error, a region of the (112) plane was captured 
by STM measurement.  
STM /STS measurements:  STM/STS are performed at liquid helium temperature (4.2 K) in 
the Unisoku -1300 system with a Nanonis controller and the built -in lock -in amplifier. 
Tungsten tips were used in all of the STM/STS measurements. In the measurement of the 
topographic images, the constant current mode was used with the setting sample bias Vbias= 
100 mV  and Isetpoint = 500 pA. When performi ng the tunneling spectra (the dI/dV  curves) and 
conduction maps, lock -in techniques were used with a modulation amplitude of 3 -5 mV, 
frequency of 707 Hz, Vbias=200 mV,  and Isetpoint=500 pA to 1 nA.  The difference of energy 
interval that arises on prominent 1D edge states on cleaved (112) and processed (112) in Fig. 
1 and Fig. 4 , respectively,  may be ascribed  to the details of doping in different batch es of 
samples.   
Calculations:  The ab initio  calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio  
simulation package (VASP) [29] within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) 
parametrized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [30]. The Kohn –Sham single -particle 
wave functions were expanded in the plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy truncation at 10 
 400 eV. The crystal structure of the unit cell of TaAs was fully relaxed until Hellmann –
Feynman for ces on each atom were less than 0.001 eV/Å with a  12×12×3 k-mesh sampled 
in the BZ. To calculate the surface and bulk electronic structure, a tight -binding Hamiltonian 
was constructed using the VASP2WANNIER90 interface [31]. The surface states ’ electronic 
structures were calculated by the surface Green’s function techniqu e[26].

 Surface  and edge  states on Fermi arc -allowed -surface (001) in TaAs crystal  
The Fermi arc surface states distribute on the top and bottom surfaces of (001) crystal face in 
TaAs (as shown in Fig. S1A ) owing to the broken  inversion symmetry. Here, we have 
calculated the Fermi surfaces on As -terminated (001) face t, which contain s the Fermi arcs , 
the trivial surface states and the bulk derived surface resonance states. By projecting the Fermi 
surface onto each of Ta - layers in the unit cell, we can see the trivial surface states decaying 
very fast , and survive  prominently  on the topmost surface. In contrast,  the Fermi arcs can be 
observed on Ta - layers all over the unit cell. It demonstrates that Fermi arc surface states can 
disperse into the bulk with a particular depth in real space , which is comparable to the unit 
constant along 𝑐 ⃗⃗⃗direction (~1.2 nm).  
We performed the STM/STS measurements on the in-situ cleaved fresh (001) surface. 
The atomic resolved topographic image is  presented in Fig. S1C, which contains high density  
point defects (vacancies). The defects induced the electrons scattering inter/intra the Fermi 
contours, and forming the quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns on the STS mapping  
(acquired with the samp le bias voltage of -25 mV ), as shown in Fig. S1d. By Fourier 
transform, the scattering wave vector can be observed in the momentum space. Fermi arcs 
and their connection to the bulk continuum can be detected  by the QPI patterns. Our results 
on (001) are in accordance with the previous works, which demonstrate the high quality of 
the TaAs crystals.  
On the cleaved (001) surface, we investigated the states at the step edge. As shown in 
Fig. S2A, there is a step with a minimal height. The LDOS has been measured  by STS, which 
shows no peaked DOS at the step edge, as shown in Fig. S2B. By carefully comparing the 
spectra at the surface with those near the step edge, it is clearly shown that the LDOS are 
perturbed  locally at step edge  (Fig. S2C). In the dI/dV  mappin gs acquired at various of bias 
voltages near the Fermi level (Fig. S2D), interference patterns originate from the electronic 
standing waves on the surface and near the step can be observed, but again, no prominent and 
uniform edge states can be detected.

Surface relax ation in the processed (112) facet  
TaAs is a non -centrosymmetric transition -metal compound with a somewhat complex crystal 
structure. Cleavage is the method of choice to obtain the desired crystal face although it is 
particularly challenging for TaAs. In this work, we also develop a procedure with Ar+ 
bombardment and post -annealing, and obtained the terraced surface as presented in Fig. S3C. 
However, regardless of nominally the same processing conditions we have observed two 
types of surface atomic configurations on (112) facet in cleaved and processed sa mples. Fig. 
S3A and B show topographic and tunneling current panels acquired simultaneously from the 
same region of the cleaved (112) surface. The topographic image in Fig. S3A shows a perfect 
consistenc y with the Ta - arrangement in the structure model on (112) plane. It indicates that  
the surface relaxation is negligible during the cleave process . We note however , as revealed 
by the tunneling signal in Fig. S3B  the atomic configurations show certain  departure from the 
23 
 structur al model. D uring the measureme nts, the STM is working in a constant current mode 
in acquiring a morphological image, there is a loop response time to hold the setpoint, the 
change of the tunneling current signals can be recorded , simultaneously . The p anel in Fig. 
S3B reveals the modula tion of tunneling current signals in each pixel . It contains negligible 
height information. Tunneling signals contributed from atoms in both the topmost and the 
second layers can be revealed. The deviation between (A) and (B)  implies a strong 
hybridization  of LDOS  between the topmost and the underneath atoms. Fig. S3D shows the 
topographic STM image of the processed (112) surface. Here, the atom configuration is 
consistent with the tunneling signal image of the cleaved (112) surface in tunneling panel Fig. 
S3B. It indicates that the annealing process results in the relaxation of the surface atoms to 
achieve a more stable stat e.

iterative direction,  and 𝑅⃗⃗1, 𝑅⃗⃗2 define the surface plane (𝑛,𝑛,2) with 𝑛=6 where the 
surface states are calculated; (C) The schematic illustration of semi -infinite geometry formed  in 
iterative Green’s function procedure based on the supercell in (B). Due to the specific atom 
occupation condition, the periodic step edges jointing (110) and (001) planes are generated 
automatically. In the calculation slab model, there are two different terraced surfaces (top and 
bottom), on the top surface (D), the step ledges are terminated by As - atoms (constructed by small 
(001) with As -termination); and on the bottom surface (E), the step ledges are terminated by Ta - 
atoms (constructed by small (001) with Ta -termination). Ta -As chains labeled from C1 to C12 
on each (1 10) terrace can be observed on the to p (D)  and the bottom  (E) surfaces.

FS plots on the surface BZ (half of the whole BZ in the white dashed square) at 𝜀= -20 meV with 
respect to bulk Fermi energy calculated based on the slab model in Fig. S 4D (top surface). FSs 
on the whole surface BZ can be inferred through time -reversal symmetry. Near the center of the 
half BZ, there are 4 pairs of chiral Weyl points, and 4 Fermi arcs can be distinguished as 
numbered from 1 to 4. In the main text arc 1 is presented . Here, other three arcs that projected on 
the Ta -As chains on (110) t errace have been calculated. Distribution of the projection weight has 
been shown in (B), where the prominent projection weight can all be observed near the step and 
it decreases steadily as the position moving away from the step,  in particular for the dir ection 
along  (C12 to C7). (C) Surface FS plots on the surface BZ (half of the whole BZ in the white

2 and 3 near the center of the half BZ; (D) to ( E) show the projections of the selected Fermi a rc 
(1, 2 and 3) on the Ta -As chain as numbered in Fig. S 4E. The prominent projection weights of 
the three Fermi arcs are all localized on Ta -As chains near the step edge and decrease steadily as 
the position far from the step which is in accordance with th e calculation results on the top surface 
and can be well account for the 1D edge states at the step on (110) surface .

S7E. The projection weight is most prominent at Ta -As chains near the step edge and decreases 
slowly as the distance from the step increased as shown in (B), which is consistent  with that on 
the top surface, as presented in the main text.

Ta- terminated edge on the bottom surface  (E). Each terrace has 8 Ta -As chains surface as labeled 
from C1 to C8.  
 
 
Fig. S1 0. 2D Fermi arc surface states on (114) terraced pla nes. Surface Fermi surface (FS) 
plots on (A) bottom surface at 𝜀=-20 meV have been drawn in half the surface BZ. The bottom 
surface ha s been described i n Fig. S 9(E). The Fermi arcs that connecting chiral Weyl points and 
being isolated from trivial states have been demonstrated ; (B) show the projection weight 
distribution of selected Fermi arcs o n the  bottom surfaces. The arcs can be observed on each of 
Ta-As chains on  the topmost surfaces without significantly enhancing at the step edges on the 
bottom surfaces, which is consistent with the experimental results that no obvious edge state has 
been detected.  The results confirm there are prominent Fermi arc surface states  on (114) crystal 
facets.
