I. INTRODUCTION
The concordance cosmological model, ŒõCDM, is rooted
in its ability to accurately describe a variety of cosmolog-
ical observations. Primary among these are the statistics
of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
[e.g., 1, 2], the distance-redshift relation obtained using type-
Ia supernovae [e.g., 3] and baryon acoustic oscillations [e.g.,
4‚Äì6], the abundance of galaxy clusters [e.g, 7, 8], the redshift
space clustering of galaxies [e.g., 9‚Äì11], and the weak grav-
itational lensing signal [e.g., 12‚Äì20]. The presence of dark
matteranddarkenergyisessentialtothesuccessofthemodel,
inwhichdarkmattercausesdensityfluctuationstogrowdueto
gravitationalinstabilities,whiledarkenergycausesanacceler-
ated expansion at late times [e.g., 21]. Although the evidence
forthepresenceofdarkmatteranddarkenergyintheUniverse
isquitecompelling,theirexistenceisagrandchallengetoour
current understanding of the physics of the Universe. The
empirical characterization of the abundance of dark matter,
the growth in its density fluctuations, and the behavior of the
equation of state for dark energy can aid in the understanding
of these components.
The measurements of density fluctuations in the early Uni-
versehavebeenmappedbyCMBexperimentssuchasWMAP
[22] and Planck [2]. These precise observations suggest that
our Universe can be described as a simple flat Œõcold dark
mattermodelwithonlyahandfulofparameters. Undertheas-

from observables in the Universe at late times.
The current observational frontier in this area is driven by
StageIIIdarkenergyexperimentswhicharedesignedtoprobe
darkenergyanddarkmatter. TheKilo-DegreeSurvey(KiDS)
[23] [24], the Dark Energy Survey (DES) [25] [26] and the
HyperSuprime-CamsurveySubaruStrategicProgram(HSC)
[27] [28] have all conducted complementary galaxy imaging
surveysthattargetmultipleprobesinordertoaddresskeyques-
tions related to dark matter and dark energy. Although these
surveys use a combination of probes to address cosmology,
gravitational lensing is the primary tool of interest. The im-
agesofbackgroundgalaxiesgetshearedinacoherentmanner
duetothepresenceofinterveningmatterdistributionbetween
them and us [e.g., 29]. The correlation of these coherent dis-
tortion patterns, commonly called the cosmic shear signal, is
relatedtotheprojectedmatterdensitydistributionandisthere-
fore sensitive to the cosmological parameters. The amplitude
of this signal and its variation with redshift can be used to
infer the growth of structure in dark matter and constrain the
parameter combination ùëÜ8=ùúé8Œ©0.5
m, whereŒ©mis the matter
density parameter.
The clustering of galaxies can also be used to probe the
large-scalestructureoftheUniverse,asgalaxiestracethemat-ter distribution [e.g., 30]. Galaxies form within dark matter
halos which are biased tracers of the matter distribution [e.g.,
31],andthegalaxybias, ùëè,isexpectedtodependuponthehalo
biasoftheirparenthalos[e.g.32]. Onlargescalesthisbiasis

vations can therefore constrain cosmological parameters that

erate with galaxy bias [e.g., 33]. The dependence of the halo
biasonthemassofthedarkmatterhaloisfurtherafunctionof
thecosmologicalparameters,especially Œ©mandùúé8[e.g.,34].
Therefore, the amplitude of the matter correlation function
can be inferred if dark matter halo masses can be measured
for galaxies using the galaxy-galaxy lensing [33, 35, 36]. The
galaxy-galaxy lensing signal is the cross correlation of lens
galaxy positions with shapes of background galaxies. Thus
together a combination of the clustering measurements and
small-scale lensing measurements can help infer cosmologi-
cal constraints [e.g., 18, 33, 35, 37‚Äì39]. Another avenue to
use galaxy-galaxy lensing is to only focus on large scales so
thatthecosmologicalinferenceisnotaffectedbyissuesrelated
to galaxy assembly bias [e.g., 40]. The galaxy-galaxy lensing
signal depends upon the halo matter cross-correlation, which
on large scales is proportional to ùëèùúâmm. The large-scale clus-
teringofofgalaxiesissensitiveto ùëè2ùúâmm. Thustogetherthey
canhelpdetermineboththeamplitudeandshapeofthematter
correlation function.
The cosmological parameter dependences of cosmic shear
or the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy
lensing signal are expected to be different and thus comple-
mentary. Thus a combination of all the three two-point cor-
relations can further reduce the uncertainties on the inferred
cosmologicalparameters[seee.g.14,20]. Thefirststepinthe
careful inference of the cosmological parameters from these
observablesisthereliablemeasurementoftheobservablesand
their covariance. There are a variety of systematics that can
affecteachofthesemeasurements,decisionsneedtobetaken
regarding the scales over which the signals can be reliably
modelled as well as a demonstration that the measurements
pass a variety of null tests. Inference of the redshift distri-
bution of source galaxies is yet another step before the weak
lensing measurements can be reliably modelled.
This is the first paper in a series of the 3 √ó2pt cosmology
analyses of the Subaru HSC Year 3 data (hereafter HSC-Y3).
In this paper (Paper I), we define the lens and source galaxy
samples to be used for the 3 √ó2pt cosmological analyses. We
presentmeasurementsofthethreetwo-pointfunctionsaswell
as the results of various systematics tests which allow us to
narrow down the scales to be used for cosmological analysis.
We also present mock galaxy catalogs and shear catalogs that
were used to obtain the covariance matrix of our measure-
ments. The inference of the cosmological parameters were
performed in a blind manner using these measurements, and
thoseresultswillbepresentedinMiyatake et al.[41,PaperII]3
andSugiyama et al.[42,PaperIII], respectively. PaperIIwill
use information on quasi-linear scales by using the emulator
based halo model, while the analysis in Paper III is based on
linear scales where a model based on perturbation theory can
beusedreliably. Themeasurementandthecosmologicalanal-

we present a brief description of our pipelines that we use to

and the cosmic shear signal from our data. In Section IV,
we present the measurements of the galaxy clustering signal,
its covariance and a variety of systematics tests designed to
assess the robustness of our measurements. In Section V,
we present the measurements of the galaxy-galaxy lensing
signal, its covariance, and a variety of null and systematics
tests. In Section VI, we similarly present the measurements
of the cosmic shear correlation functions and its covariance,
the systematic tests as well as various PSF related systematic
tests. Finally, we summarize our results in Section VII.
When performing the galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy
lensing analyses, we adopt a fiducial flat ŒõCDM cosmolog-
ical model with parameters consistent with the cosmic mi-
crowave background analysis from WMAP9. The cosmo-
logical model is specified by the CDM density parameter
Œ©cdm=0.233, the baryon density Œ©b0=0.046, the matter
densityŒ©m= Œ© cdm+Œ©b=0.279, the cosmological con-
stantŒ©Œõ=0.721, the Hubble parameter ‚Ñé=0.7, the ampli-
tude of density fluctuations ùúé8=0.82, and the spectral index
ùëõùë†=0.97. The choice of these cosmological parameters is
dictated by the cosmological parameters adopted for the sim-
ulations that form the basis of the mock catalogs that we use
for our covariance calculations [45]. While carrying out our
cosmological analyses in Paper II and III, we will account for
the cosmological dependence of our observables, so that our
choice of this fiducial cosmological model has no impact on
our cosmological inference.
II. DATA
The 3√ó2pt cosmological analyses for HSC-Y3 data will fo-
cus on a combination of probes: the cosmic shear signal, the
clustering of galaxies and their galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.
In this section, we describe the data we use for the gravita-
tionallensingmeasurements(SectionIIA),ourblindingstrat-
egy (Section IIB), the galaxy samples used for the clustering
and the galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses (Section IIC) as well
as the mock catalogs that are used to estimate the covariance
of these measurements (Section IID).A. Shape Catalog
The Hyper Suprime-Cam instrument (HSC) is a wide-field
optical imaging camera mounted at the prime focus of the
8.2-meter Subaru Telescope [46‚Äì49]. The wide field of view
combined with the excellent seeing conditions at Maunakea
and the large aperture make it an ideal telescope for surveys
targettingweaklensingmeasurementsoflarge-scalestructure.
The HSC-Subaru Strategic Program was allocated 330 nights
to carry out a three-layered imaging survey in multiple bands
with different depths [27]. The Wide layer, which is de-
signed for weak lensing cosmology, consists of multi-band
ùëîùëüùëñùëßùë¶imaging that will cover an area of approximately 1100
deg2, upon completion. The galaxy shape measurements are
carried out in the ùëñ-band which is observed at a 5‚àíùúédepth
ofùëñ‚àº26(2‚Ä≤‚Ä≤apertureforapointsource). Theimagesinthe ùëñ
band were preferentially taken under good seeing conditions,
which resulted in a median seeing of about 0.6arcsec.
The data from the survey has been processed using a fork
of Rubin‚Äôs LSST Science Pipelines catered to images taken
with HSC [50], and which is updated from time to time to
includenewfeatures,anybugfixes,andimprovementstodeal
withtheSubaruHSCdata. TheSubaruHSCsurveyhasmade
three public data releases thus far [51‚Äì53]. In this paper,
we use the shape catalog from the S19a internal data release
intermediate to PDR2 and PDR3, which was processed with
hscPipev7[54]. Therewereanumberofimprovementstothe
PSFmodeling,imagewarpingkernel,backgroundsubtraction
and bright star masks, which have improved the quality of the
shapecataloginHSC-Y3comparedtotheYear1shapecatalog
[55,56]. Thedetailedselectionofgalaxiesthatformtheshape
catalogispresentedinLi et al.[54]. Briefly,theshapecatalog
consistsofgalaxiesselectedfromthefull-depthandfull-color
region in all five filters. Apart from some basic quality cuts
related to pixel level information, we select extended objects
with an extinction corrected cmodel magnitude ùëñ <24.5,ùëñ-
band SNR‚â•10, resolution>0.3,>5ùúédetection in at least

The shape catalog consists of a total of 35.7 million galax-
iesspanninganareaofabout433sq.deg,aneffectivenumber
density of 19.9 arcmin‚àí2. It is divided into six disjoint re-
gions: XMM, VVDS, GAMA09H, WIDE12H, GAMA15H
and HECTOMAP fields [see Fig. 2 in 54]. The shape mea-
surements in the catalog were calibrated using detailed image
simulations, such that the galaxy property dependent multi-

biases due to PSF model shape residual correlations and star
galaxy shape correlations as systematics requiring special at-
tentionandmarginalization,wewillalsoinvestigatetheeffect
of these systematics on the cosmic shear measurements.
As shown in Appendix D, we exclude a ‚àº20sq. degree

The HSC-Y3 shape catalog is accompanied by a photo-
metric redshift catalog of galaxies based on three different
methods [57][58]. The software Mizukiis a template fitting
based photometric redshift estimate code, while DEmPzand
DNNzprovide machine learning based estimates of the pho-
tometricredshiftsofgalaxies[59]. Eachofthesemethodspro-
vides an estimate of the posterior distribution function of the
redshift for each galaxy, denoted as ùëÉ(ùëßs). Photometric red-
shiftuncertaintiesareoneofmostimportantsystematiceffects

the cosmological parameters if they are affected by unknown
residual systematic errors. To minimize the impact of such
errors,wewilladoptthemethodinOguriandTakada[60]that
allowstoself-consistentlycalibratesuchphoto- ùëßerrors,using
a single sample of photometric source galaxies and multiple
samples of spectroscopic lens galaxies in galaxy-galaxy weak
lensing measurements.
Forthispurpose,wedefineasampleofbackgroundgalaxies
that satisfies
‚à´7
ùëßl,max+ùëßdiffùëÉ(ùëßs)ùëëùëßs‚â•ùëùthresh, (1)
whereùëßl,maxwas chosen to be equal to 0.70, the maximum
redshift of the lens samples that we will use for the galaxy-
galaxy lensing measurements (see below), ùëßdiff=0.05and
ùëùthresh=0.99. Such cuts significantly reduce the contamina-
tion of source galaxies which are physically associated with
the lens galaxies which can dilute the weak lensing signal at
small separations. As our default choice, we use the ùëÉ(ùëß)
estimates for each galaxy provided by DEmPz.
The selection (Eq. 1) reduces the total number of galaxies
inourweaklensingsampletobejust 24percentoftheoriginal
shape catalog,[61] with an effective number density of 4.9
galaxies per square arcmin. Instead, if we use the posteriordistributions of the redshifts given by DNNzorMizuki, the
numberofgalaxiesis 9or35percentoftheentiretyoftheshape
catalog, respectively. These would correspond to an effective
number density of 1.9and6.8galaxies per square arcmin for
DNNzandMizuki, respectively. These differences in the
number density are entirely driven by the differences in the
widthsoftheindividual ùëÉ(ùëß)‚Äôsinferredbythedifferentcodes.
The inferred ùëÉ(ùëß)estimates for individual galaxies obtained
using DNNzare on average broader than those obtained in
MizukiandDEmPz. The broader widths result in a smaller
number of galaxies that satisfy the cut shown in Eq. (1).
Theinferredredshiftdistributionsofthesampleofourfidu-
cial sources are shown in Fig. 2 based on the Bayesian Hier-
archical Inference presented in Rau et al.[62]. These redshift
distribution inferences (90 percent credible region shown in
gray) use both the individual redshift PDFs from photomet-
ric redshift estimation codes, as well as the measurements of
clustering of the galaxies in our source sample, with that of
redgalaxiesselectedbythe CAMIRA algorithm[63,64]. The
90percent credible intervals on the redshift inference from
each of these techniques individually are shown as the red
shaded region and black points with errors, respectively. As
mentioned before, we have multiple choices of photometric
redshift estimates for our sample of galaxies. Even though
we select galaxies using the DEmPzredshift PDFs, the same
sourcegalaxysamplealsohasredshiftestimatescharacterized
by the other codes, which help in pinning down any system-
atic uncertainties. The two panels in Fig. 2 correspond to
the use of individual redshift PDFs from DEmPzandDNNz,
respectively, but for the same set of source galaxies. The
clustering method does not extend to the entire range of red-
shifts as we run out of galaxies with well calibrated redshifts
from CAMIRA beyond a redshift of 1.2. Note that the cross-
correlationresults(markedbyWX)differineachofthepanels
by their a-posteriori normalization factor from the joint like-
lihood inference between WX and DNNz/DEmPz, as can be
seen upon a close inspection of the two panels. The redshift
axes in each panel are aligned vertically for ease of compari-5
son.
In the upper panel, we see a broad agreement between
the redshift inference based on just the redshift PDFs from
DEmPzandtheclusteringredshifts. However,itisinteresting
to note that DEmPzpredicts a bimodal feature in the red-
shift distribution with a dip in the number of galaxies with
redshifts atùëß‚àº1.0. The clustering redshift inferences have
large and correlated errors, but do not show any indication
of such a bimodal distribution. The redshift inference based
onDEmPzshows very small support at redshifts lower than
0.75(less than a percent), by construction. In the bottom
panel, which uses DNNzestimates of the redshift PDFs, we
do not see a substantial evidence of a dip at redshift of unity
in this inference. However, we notice that the inference using
DNNzdoesshowsomenon-zerosupportevenbelowthemax-
imum lens redshifts we use of 0.75, as seen in the clustering
measurements (although at low significance).
Any systematic differences in the redshifts of our sources
could translate into biases in the measured weak lensing sig-
nals. InAppendixA,wepresentourestimatesofsuchpotential
biases and suggest that shifting the inferred redshift PDFs by
a free parameter Œîùëßis sufficient in order to marginalize over
such uncertainties with percent level accuracy.
B. Blinding strategy
All of our cosmological analyses are carried out in a two-
tiered blind manner similar to our strategy in our Year 1 anal-
ysis [65]. As described in the HSC-Y3 shape catalog paper
Liet al.[54], we use different multiplicative bias factors in
order to blind our analyses in the first tier, which provide a
convenient way to change the data vectors related to the weak
lensingobservables. Weobtainthreeblindcatalogs ùëñ=0,1,2
where theùëó-th galaxy has a multiplicative bias equal to
ùëöùëñùëó=ùëöùëó+dùëöùëñ
1+dùëöùëñ
2, (2)
where dùëöùëñ
1is a multiplicative bias known to the analysis lead
designedtopreventunblindingduetoaccidentalcomparisons
of multiple versions of the catalog. This value is removed
in the measurement codes before performing any measure-
ments with any of the catalogs. The three values dùëöùëñ
2are
one of the three choices (‚àí0.1,‚àí0.05,0.),(‚àí0.05,0.,0.05),
(0.,0.05,0.1). These amplitude offsets are motivated by the
differences in the values of amplitude of density fluctuations,
ùúé8, as obtained by the CMB analysis by the Planck collabo-
ration [2] and other large-scale structure probes [e.g., 14, 20].
Allofourlensingrelatedmeasurementswereperformedwith
all three blinded catalogs at the same time. The cosmological
analyses and all systematics tests were performed on each of
thesecatalogs,separately. AswewilldescribeinsectionsVA
and VIA in this paper, we modify our covariances to account
for the fact that each of our catalogs has a different value of
dùëö2(aprocedurethatcanbeperformedwithoutknowledgeof
dùëö2). In this manner, the ùúí2of the best fit models to mea-
surements performed using the three catalogs are not able to
accidentally distinguish the true catalog.

Thesecondtierofblindingisperformedattheanalysislevel.
The results of our analyses of all the three catalogs prior to
unblinding are presented by masking the value of the inferred
cosmologicalparameters. Oncealltheanalysesareperformed
and the relevant systematics checks are passed (see Paper II
and III for a detailed checklist of tests to be passed prior to
unblinding), we unblind each of the tiers, first starting with
the second tier. The first tier of the catalog level unblinding
is performed by a HSC team member external to the analysis
team right at the end. Throughout this paper, we will show
the measurements from our analysis of the blind catalog id
=2, which was found to be the true catalog post unblinding.
No changes have been made to the analysis post unblinding.
The other blinded catalogs also similarly passed each of the
systematic tests as we show here for the blind catalog id 2.6
C. Lens Galaxy Sample
We use the large-scale structure sample compiled as part
of the Data Release 11 (DR11) [66] [67] of the SDSS-III
(Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey) project [68] for
measurementsoftheclusteringofgalaxiesandaslensgalaxies
for the galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements. The lens
galaxysampleusedinthispaperisthesameasthatusedinthe

et al.[70]). The methodology used to construct the catalog is
the same as that described in Miyatake et al.[71]. We briefly
describe the catalog here.
The BOSS is a spectroscopic follow-up survey of galaxies
and quasars selected from the imaging data obtained by the
SDSS-I/II and covers an area of approximately 11,000 deg2
[72]usingthededicated2.5mSDSSTelescope[73]. Imaging
data obtained in five photometric bands ( ùë¢ùëîùëüùëñùëß) as part of the
SDSSI/IIsurveys[74‚Äì76]wereaugmentedwithanadditional
3,000 deg2in SDSS DR9 to cover a larger portion of the sky
inthesouthernregion[68,77‚Äì79]. Thesedatawereprocessed
by a series of the photometric processing pipelines [80‚Äì82],
and corrected for Galactic extinction [83] to obtain a reliable
photometric catalog which serves as an input to select targets
for spectroscopy [68]. The resulting spectra were processed
by an automated pipeline to perform redshift determination
and spectral classification [84]. The BOSS large-scale struc-
ture (LSS) samples are selected using algorithms focused on
galaxies in different redshifts: 0.15< ùëß < 0.35(LOWZ)
and0.43< ùëß < 0.70(CMASS). In addition to the galax-
ies targeted by the BOSS project, these samples also include
galaxies whichpass thetarget selectionbut havealready been
observed as part of the SDSS-I/II project (legacy galaxies).
These legacy galaxies were subsampled in each SDSS sector
[85] on the sky so that they obey the same completeness as
that of the LOWZ/CMASS targets in their respective redshift
ranges [86].
Various color-magnitude selections guarantee a population
ofmassivegalaxiesspanningaredshiftrange ùëß‚àà[0.15,0.70]
inthespectroscopicsurvey. Theresultantsample,however,is
not entirely a volume or flux limited sample of galaxies.
The SDSS spectrograph can assign at most 1000 fibers on
the sky at one time in a circular tile region (for the BOSS
survey). Therefore an adaptive tiling algorithm was used to
maximize the completeness of the survey. The spectra ob-
tained from the observations were processed with specpipe,
the spectroscopic pipeline for determination of redshift and
spectral classification. Despite all optimizations, there exist
galaxies which obey the target selection, but cannot be as-
signed a fiber due to limitations of how close fibers can be
assigned on a given tile. In such cases, the galaxy is assigned
theredshiftofitsnearestneighbourgalaxywhichwasassigned

ies for which specpipe failed to determine a redshift. In the
fiducial DR11 LSS catalog, the nearest neighbouring galaxy
gets an additional weight to account for the fiber-collided or
redshift failure galaxy. We instead assign the nearest neigh-
bour redshift to photometric galaxies with fiber collisions or
redshift failures. This should be equivalent when the entire

sample is used. However, our method allows for making fur-
thersub-samplesbasedonabsolutemagnitude. Guo et al.[87]
have shown using detailed tests on mock galaxy catalogs that
the nearest neighbor redshift correction achieves sub-percent
accuracy in the projected galaxy auto-correlation function for
scales used in this paper.
This modified DR11 LSS sample described above forms
our parent catalog. We obtain the k+e-corrected ùëñ-band abso-
lute magnitudes for individual SDSS galaxies using the k and
e-correctionstabulatedinWake et al.[88]relyingonthe‚Äúpas-
siveplusstar-forminggalaxies‚Äùspectraltemplatesconstructed

We use weights provided for all galaxies to account for the
inversecorrelationbetweenthenumberdensityofgalaxiesand
that of stars [90], and that of seeing ( ùë§‚àó) as provided in the
SDSS DR11 large scale structure catalogs [86].
We define three subsamples which are approximately
volume-limited by luminosity. The ‚ÄúLOWZ‚Äù subsample con-
sists of galaxies with ùëß‚àà [0.15,0.35], and the ‚ÄúCMASS1‚Äù
and ‚ÄúCMASS2‚Äù subsamples consists of galaxies with ùëß‚àà
[0.43,0.55]andùëß‚àà [0.55,0.70], respectively. We ap-
ply further cuts on the absolute magnitude of galaxies of
ùëÄùëñ‚àí5 log h<‚àí21.5,‚àí21.9and‚àí22.2for the three sub-
samples, respectively. This results in subsamples which have
anumberdensityequalto ¬Øùëõg/[10‚àí4(‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc)‚àí3]‚âÉ1.8,0.74
and0.45, respectively, which are a few times smaller than
those of the entire parent (color-cut and flux-limited) LOWZ
and CMASS samples. The redshift distribution of the three7
lenssubsamplescomparedtothestacked ùëÉ(ùëß)distributionfor
the HSC source galaxy sample we use in this paper is shown
inFig.3whichshowsthewellseparatedredshiftdistributions
of our lens subsamples compared to the source galaxies.[91]
Please seeFig. 1 inMiyatake et al.[69] forthe redshift distri-
bution of the three luminosity-limited subsamples, compared
to that of the flux-limited sample. As we will show in Sec-
tions IVB and VB, use of such subsamples helps reduce sys-
tematics related to the variation of the measurements within
each of the three redshift bins.
We will use random points in order to measure the galaxy
clustering signal from these subsamples, as well as testing for
systematics in the lensing signal. The random points are also
useful to infer the potential dilution of the weak lensing sig-
nal due to the use of galaxies physically clustered with our
subsamples, but are inferred to be at a higher redshift due to
systematicandstatisticalerrorsinthephotometricredshiftdis-
tribution. The random points for each of our galaxy samples
were constructed by downsampling the DR11 LSS random
catalogs which follow the angular mask and redshift distri-
butions of all galaxies in the LOWZ and CMASS samples,
respectively,suchthattheyfollowtheredshiftdistributionsof
our galaxy subsamples.
We will show that the clustering and lensing observables
within the redshift bin of each sample do not evolve signif-
icantly given the approximate volume-limited nature of our
catalogs, compared to that for the flux-limited sample. This
is similar to the findings in Miyatake et al.[71, their fig. 3],
but for a sample of stellar mass selected galaxies. Our sam-
ples also allow a simpler treatment of the magnification bias
effectonthegalaxy-galaxyweaklensingthantheflux-limited
sample [see 69, 70].
D. Simulations For Covariance Measurements
In order to carry out the Bayesian inference of the cosmo-
logical parameters, we will compare the measurements of the
galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing signal of the lens
subsamplesdescribedinthesubsectionabovewiththeoretical
models. The covariance matrix of these measurements pro-
vides a metric to compare the theoretical predictions to these
observations, and thus a robust determination of uncertain-
ties in the inferred parameters, which is a crucial component
of a Bayesian analysis. We use mock catalogs of SDSS and
HSC galaxies, generated from the N-body simulation based
full-sky light-cone simulations [45], to estimate the covari-
ance matrix for our observables [also see Appendix B of Ref.
69,fordetails]. WeproducealargenumberofsyntheticSDSS

ingpropertiesofSDSSgalaxies. TheHSCgalaxymocksalso
includepropertiesofthegalaxiessuchastheangularpositions
of each galaxy, their galaxy shapes and the simulated lensing
effect. We perform mock measurements of galaxy clustering
and galaxy-galaxy lensing signal with such synthetic galaxy
data, in order to estimate the statistical uncertainties.1. Generation of mock shape catalogs
We present the creation of the mock catalogs of galaxy
shapes for the HSC-Y3 data. We use the 108full sky lensing
simulations in Takahashi et al.[45] in order to construct the
mockcatalogs. Thesesimulationsadoptaflat ŒõCDMcosmol-
ogy consistent with the 9-year WMAP cosmology (WMAP9)
[92]. Toproduceasetofgalaxyshapecatalogs,wefollowthe
same methodology as adopted in Shirasaki et al.[93].
Weuse13differentrotationsoftheHSC-Y3skyareaonthe
fullskytoextract13approximatelynon-overlappingHSC-Y3
survey footprints out of each full sky lensing map. The full
sky lensing map yields the shear for a given source redshift
at the location of each healpix pixel within the mock survey
footprints. Intotal,wethushave 108√ó13=1404realizations

tothatofHSC-Y3data. Theseshearmapsarethenrotatedback
so that they occupy the same sky coordinates as the HSC-Y3
footprint.
We use these shear maps to construct mock shape catalogs
by using the observed photometric redshifts and angular po-
sitions of real galaxies from the HSC-Y3 shape catalog. We
rotate the shape of each source galaxy at random to erase the
real lensing signal imprinted on the HSC galaxies. In prac-
tice, we first rotate the distortion of individual galaxies œµobs
and obtain the rotated distortion as œµran=œµobsùëíùëñùúô, whereùúôis
a random number between 0 and 2ùúã. We have to be careful
that the observed distortion of a galaxy is different from the
intrinsic distortion due to the measurement error. We model
the intrinsic shape œµintand measurement error œµmeain the fol-
lowing manner:

galaxies on the sky including the lensing weights.
2. Generation of mock SDSS galaxy catalogs (lens and clustering
samples)
We populate galaxies in the dark matter halos in each of
our realizations using a halo occupation distribution (HOD)
framework. The HOD ‚ü®ùëÅ‚ü©ùëÄdefines the number of galaxies
in a halo of mass ùëÄ. As is standard practice, we divide the
HOD into a central and a satellite galaxy component, where
‚ü®ùëÅgal‚ü©ùëÄ=‚ü®ùëÅcen‚ü©ùëÄ+‚ü®ùëÅsat‚ü©ùëÄ, (7)

. (9)
To estimate HOD parameters, we first measure the cluster-
ing abundance of LOWZ, CMASS1, and CMASS2 sample
using the clustering measurement pipeline described in Sec-
tion IIIA. The clustering covariance is obtained using 192
approximately equal area jackknife regions of the SDSS foot-
print. Wealsomeasureabundanceofeachsample. Toavoidan
over-dependence of the HOD constraints on the abundances,
weuseamoreconservative10%errorestimateonthesemea-
surements. We model these measurements by emulator-based
halo model [69] to obtain the HOD parameters, where we
adoptthefittingrange 0.5< ùëÖ/[‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc]<80. Notethatwe
assumeWMAP9flat- ŒõCDMcosmology[92]forthemeasure-

fits are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding best fit param-
eters for the three subsamples are noted in Table I. Given that
we are only using the clustering signal to fit the halo occu-
pation distribution parameters, we expect a large number of
degeneracies to be unresolved.
Weusetheseparameterstopopulategalaxiesindarkmatter
halos in the following manner. For every halo in the simula-
tion, we compute the central halo occupation ‚ü®ùëÅcen‚ü©ùëÄ, which
acts as a probability for it to host a central galaxy within the
halo. The central galaxy is assumed to reside at the center of
each halo and is at rest with respect to its host halo. For halos

The python functions allow input catalogs to be read in a

formation about the angular positions, redshifts, and weights
of galaxies. These are then passed to the C++ code in or-

correct for the clustering measurements. On the other hand,
for the weak lensing signal, we additionally have to consider
the dependence of the critical surface density on the fiducial
cosmological parameters and the cosmological model under
consideration.The various inputs to the clustering pipeline such as the
cosmological model to be used for the measurements, the
minimum and maximum projected distances, the number of
radial bins, the number of bins in projected radius, the types
of galaxies used to measure the clustering (cross or auto) are
passed via a simple yaml file.
The pipeline has been validated by comparing the corre-
lation function measurements against those measured by the
BOSSsurveycollaborationusingtheentireBOSS-LOWZand
BOSS-CMASS samples.
B. Galaxy-galaxy Lensing Pipeline
The gravitational lensing due to the presence of mass be-
tween us and the far away source galaxies results in coherent
distortions in their shapes. Such distortions can be inferred
from the observed distribution of ellipticities of these galax-
ies. As galaxies have intrinsic shapes, this signal needs to
be measured as a statistical average of the shapes of a large
number of galaxies.
The HSC-Y3 shape catalog provides the ellipticity compo-
nents(ùëí1,ùëí2)along with the weights for every galaxy ùë§s, the
additiveandmultiplicativebiases (ùëê1,ùëê2,ùëö)andthevariance
of the ellipticity ùëíRMS. Givenùúô, the angle between the line
joining the lens and the source galaxy in the plane of the sky
and the x-axis of the coordinate system, the tangential distor-
tion in shape is given by
ùëít=‚àíùëí1cos(2ùúô)‚àíùëí2sin(2ùúô). (12)
The average of the tangential ellipticity is proportional to the
tangential shear induced on the galaxy by the matter distri-
bution correlated with the lens galaxy. The tangential shear
depends upon the surface mass density, Œ£(ùëÖ), and the critical
surface density for lensing Œ£critsuch that

choose those sources that have a large probability to lie at
a specified redshift according to Eq. 1. The parameter ùëßmax
can be chosen to correspond to the maximum redshifts of the
sample,andthetunableparameters ùëßdiffandùëùcutwhichcanbe
changed to allow the cuts to be more stringent. Alternatively,
the pipeline also allows for the possibility to carry out the
source selection by using the best estimate of the photometric
redshift.

the average multiplicative bias and is defined as as ÀÜùëö=
Œ£lsùë§lsùëöùë†/Œ£lsùë§ls.
In addition, we consider the effect on the multiplicative
and the additive selection bias. Li et al.[54] found that the
multiplicative bias and selection bias are proportional to the

Finally we also repeat the same exact measurement proce-
dure mentioned above for the weak lensing signal but around
random points which are 40 times larger than the number of
lenses. We use random catalogs which occupy the same area
on the sky and follow the same redshift distributions as our
lenssubsamples. Thisallowsustosubtractoutanylarge-scale

parable to the field of view of HSC. This changes our final

the above calculations in order to measure the galaxy-galaxy
lensing signal. At its core, it needs to perform nearest neigh-
bour calculations on the plane of the sky between lens and
source galaxies. It uses the the same kd-tree code as used in
the galaxy clustering pipeline in order to speed up these cal-
culations. Thecorefunctionsofthepipelineareagainwritten
in C++ for speed, with interfaces provided via python using
SWIG. The input and output is handled on the python side
making it easier to swap in and out different catalogs for the
lensingmeasurementswhilepreservingthecorefunctionality.
In order to make the code memory efficient, we search for

differencebetweenthenumberoflensandthesourcesamples,
we generate the tree using the lens catalogs. This in turn also
makes the code memory efficient, because the entirety of the
sourcecatalogneednotbereadrightatthebeginninginorder
to generate the tree.
Thecomputationoftheweaklensingsignalandthecovari-
ance is parallelized using a division of tasks. Given that the
code requires to compute the weak lensing signal around ran-
dompoints,weusuallydividethetaskintocomputationofthe
weak lensing signal around the lens galaxy samples and the
randomsintoseparatetasks. Thecovariancecomputationsare
also performed by running the weak lensing pipeline over a
large number of mock catalogs. This allows us to massively
parallelizethecomputationoftheweaklensingsignalandco-
variances. The code also allows for the computation of the
weak lensing signal in different fields separately. The output

can then later be combined in the post-processing.
The various inputs to the weak lensing pipeline such as
the cosmological model to be used for the measurements, the
minimum and maximum projected distances, the number of11
radialbins,thelensandsourceselectionparameterscanallbe
passed via simple yaml files. The pipeline has been validated
by comparing the weak lensing measurements with a number
of independent codes written by other authors in the HSC
survey collaboration.
C. Cosmic Shear Measurement Code
In order to compute the cosmic shear, we use the estimator
in Li et al.[54] for the shear estimate for each galaxy,

We also diagnose any contamination of the above corre-
lations due to the presence of point spread function (PSF)
anisotropies. Such residuals are expected to be present due
totheimperfectionsinthemodelingandthemeasurementsof
the PSF. We continue to follow the prescription presented in
Hikage et al.[97] and Troxel et al.[98], such that the system-
atics due to the PSF errors are added in a linear fashion and
arise from two sources,
ùõæsys=ùõºpsfùõæp+ùõΩpsfùõæq, (28)whereùõæpis the shape of the PSF model, and ùõæqis the dif-
ference between the true PSF of stars and the model PSF at
their locations. These two terms account for the error in the
deconvolution of the PSF from the galaxy shapes and the er-
ror in the shapes due to the imperfect modeling of the PSF.

Here the quantities ùúâpp
¬±andùúâqq
¬±are the auto-correlations of
ùõæpandùõæq, respectively and ùúâpq
¬±corresponds to the cross-
correlation of the two quantities. These correlations can be
measured directly from the data by using the shapes of stars,
that were reserved for modeling the PSF over the entire field
of view. In HSC, the PSF measurement and modeling is
performed over each exposure, rather than the coadd and 20
percent of the stars are randomly reserved for PSF testing.
Since these stars are randomly selected during each expo-
sure, the number of stars that are never used in the PSF de-
termination is quite small. The HSC pipeline assigns a flag
i_calib_psf_used to denote stars that have been used for the
PSF determination at least in 80percent of the visits they
belong to. We use stars with flags i_calib_psf_used=True
to compute these correlations, because it is less noisy. We
also take into account the uncertainty of the predicted ÀÜùúâpsf,¬±
whether we use i_calib_psf_used=True orFalse. In Sec-
tion VIB, we will present our constraints on the parameters
ùõºPSFandùõΩPSFand our suggested priors for the cosmological
analyses.
NotethatourtreatmentofthePSFsystematicsinthe3 √ó2pt
analyses differs from the default setup used in the cosmic
shear analyses alone in our companion papers Li et al.[43]
and Dalal et al.[44], where we account for the errors in the
PSF moments upto fourth order following the methodology
developed in [99]. In Sugiyama et al.[42] and Miyatake et
al.[41], we will test the impact of including such effect for
the HSC source galaxies used in our analyses and quantify its
impact on the cosmological parameters.
Finally, we also will perform an ùê∏/ùêµmode decomposition

The clustering of LOWZ galaxies clearly shows the transi-
tionbetweentheone-halotermandthetwo-halotermonscales
around 1.5‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc. This transition is less pronounced for the
CMASS1andCMASS2subsamples. Inbothourcosmological
analyses we avoid modeling below the transition scale due to
uncertaintiesintheaccuracyoftheirmodeling. Wehavetested
the accuracy of both our modeling schemes against different
systematic uncertainties and decided on the scale cuts that we
will use for our analysis in Miyatake et al.[41] and Sugiyama
et al.[42]. The validation of the scale cuts include tests on
different models for how satellite galaxies populate dark mat-
ter halos, whether the central galaxies are off-centered within
their respective halos, the presence of incompleteness in the
halooccupationdistributionofcentralgalaxies,orthatofhalo
assembly bias, in addition to the choice of halo definitions in
simulations. Based on the validation analyses, we use a range
of[2,30]‚Ñé‚àí1Mpcand[8,80]‚Ñé‚àí1Mpcfor the small-scale and
large-scale analyses, respectively.
We use the 108 realizations of the full sky mock catalogs
imprinted with the BOSS LOWZ, CMASS1 and CMASS2
footprints. Within each realization we utilize 192 jackknife
regions of the SDSS survey footprint [see 71, for details],
measureùë§pfor each jackknife region, and estimate the co-
variancematrixfromthemeasured ùë§p‚Äôsfromallthejackknife
regions. We then average the covariances for the 108 realiza-
tionstoestimatethecovariancematrixforeachoftheLOWZ,
CMASS1, and CMASS2 subsamples. The covariance ma-
trix estimated in this way is used for our cosmology analysis.

One can also expect some cross-covariance between the
measurements as the CMASS1 and CMASS2 subsamples

the same large-scale structure, although we expect this to be
a small effect. Finally, we have also analytically checked that

B. Systematic Tests
Wecarryoutacoupleoftestsinordertounderstandthepos-
sible systematics in our analysis. The first is the dependence
ofthegalaxynumberdensityinourlenssampleonseeingand
the number density of stars. In Ross et al.[4], these relations
were calibrated based on the entire large scale structure sam-
ple. Since we are including a cut on the luminosity which
is dependent on luminosity we are preferentially selecting the
brighter galaxies. If the dependence is weaker for brighter
galaxies then we may end up giving extra weight to brighter
galaxies.
Toaccountforthereductioninthenumberdensityofgalax-
ies in regions where there is a large stellar number density,
the large-scale structure catalogs have been assigned a stellar
density weight. Since this weight is also dependent on the
magnitude of galaxies, we carry over the weights assigned to
these galaxies even in our subsamples. In order to test how
suchsystematicstellarweightsaffecttheclusteringsignal,we
showthevariationoftheclusteringsignalwithandwithoutthe
systematic star weights in Fig 8. The effects on the clustering
signalallappearwithinthestatisticalerrorbudgets,especially
considering the fact that the measurements are correlated on
large scales.Next,wealsotestouthowmuchtheclusteringsignalvaries
asafunctionofredshift. Inourcosmologicalanalyseswewill
consider the average redshift of each of the subsamples as the
representative redshift for our measurements and compare it
to the theoretical predictions for cosmological inference. The
cosmological ingredients such as the halo mass function, the
halobias,andtheclusteringofmatterwithitselfandthehalos
varies as a function of redshift. At fixed halo occupation dis-
tribution, these changes are at the sub-percent level. Further,

We measure ŒîŒ£in 30 logarithmic radial bins in projected
distance in the range [0.05,80.0]‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc. As described be-
fore, We use the source catalog of HSC galaxies satisfying
Eq. (1) with ùëßmin=0.7,ùëßdiff=0.05,ùëùcut=0.99. We carry
out our measurements of the weak lensing signal in the six
different fields separately and later on combine them in post-
processing.
The measurement of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal in-
cludes the conversion of galaxy shear ùõætto the matter surface
densityŒîŒ£and the conversion of the angular radial bin ùúÉto
theprojectedradialbin ùëÖ. Todotheseconversion,weassume
a fiducial cosmology for measurement. Because we use the
radial bin in the unit of ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpcand it is independent to the
value of Hubble parameter ‚Ñé, the only relevant cosmologi-
cal parameter is the matter density parameter Œ©min the flat
ŒõCDM model thatwe focus in thecompanion cosmology pa-
pers. We use a flat ŒõCDM model with Œ©m=0.279as the
fiducial cosmology for measurement.
A. Measurements And Covariance
We show the weak lensing signal ŒîŒ£for the three subsam-
ples used in our analysis in the three different panels in the
middle row of Fig. 5, respectively. Although we have mea-
suredthesignalsonsmallscales,werestricttoscalesbeyond1

across the three different subsamples.
For the covariance estimation, we measure the galaxy-
galaxy lensing signals using mock lens galaxy catalogs de-scribed in Section IID2 and the corresponding 1404mock
shape catalogs in Section IID1. We construct a total data
vectorŒîŒ£byconcatenatingthemeasurementsofallourthree

Our blinding scheme described in detail in Section IIB relies
ontheuseofdifferentmultiplicativebiasfactorsforthreedif-
ferent catalogs, only one of which is correct. However, our
mock simulations do not include any multiplicative bias fac-
tors. The covariance for the galaxy-galaxy lensing measure-
ments computed in this manner cannot therefore be directly
used with the three different blind catalogs.
To estimate the covariance for each of the blinded catalogs
withnon-zeromultiplicativebiases,weincludethemultiplica-
tivebiasinEqs.(5)and(6)bychanging ùõæ‚Üí(1+ÀÜùëö)(1+ÀÜùëösel)ùõæ
at the catalog level. The value of the multiplicative bias ÀÜùëöis
takenfromthecorrespondingblindcatalog. However,wehave
threedifferentblindcatalogswithdifferentmultiplicativebias,
and iterating mock measurements for all the blind catalogs is
computationallyexpensive. Toavoidthisiteration,wedevelop
a rescaling method in order to obtain the galaxy-galaxy lens-
ing signal with non-zero multiplicative bias from one without
multiplicative bias. We first note that the observed galaxy el-
lipticity in Eqs. (5) and (6) in the presence of multiplicative
biases can be expanded as

The mock galaxy catalogs represent the intrinsic galaxy
distribution at the redshift of galaxy, but does not include the
magnification bias effect on the observed galaxy distribution
by gravitational lensing by foreground matter fluctuation. We
evaluate the contribution of magnification bias to the auto-
covariance of galaxy-galaxy lensing signals analytically as in
Sugiyama et al.[70] (see Appendix A of the paper). In this
paper, we also evaluate the contribution of magnification bias
tocross-covariancebetweengalaxy-galaxylensingandcosmic

based on the DNNzestimates due to their availability in time
when the covariance calibrations were started. Therefore the
mock measurements for the covariance were also performed
withasourcesampleselectedbasedonusingtheredshiftPDFs
from DNNzused in Eq. (1). The covariance in the galaxy-
galaxy lensing signal consists of two terms, the shape noise
and the covariance due to large-scale structure. The shapenoise depends upon the number density of the source galaxy
sample,whilethelarge-scalestructuretermarisesindependent
ofthesourcegalaxysample. Theshapenoisetermdominates
on small scales but decreases as we consider larger and larger
separations owing to the larger number of lens-source pairs,
where the large scale structure term then can play a dominant
part. We measure each of these terms separately.[101]
Given that our fiducial sample consists of galaxies selected
using redshift PDFs from DEmPzwhich results in a source
sample with a higher source galaxy number density, we scale
the shape noise term by the square root of the ratio of the
source galaxy number density when selected using DNNzto
that obtained using a selection in DEmPz. We maintain the
large-scale structure term as is.
Finally, we also note that the mock galaxy-galaxy lensing
signals are used further to estimate the cross-covariance with
thecosmic shearmeasurements bycombining thesemeasure-
ments with the cosmic shear signals measured from the same
set of mock shape catalogs in Section VIA.

One likely explanation is that the cross systematic appears
on a fixed angular scale, and given the redshift differences
in each of our subsamples, this angular scale corresponds to
a different distance in comoving coordinates for each of our
subsample. The scale where this cross systematic appears is
2.3 deg, which is slightly larger than the HSC field-of-view

small scale cuts of 12‚Ñé‚àí1Mpcand 3‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc, respectively.

Galaxieswhicharephysicallycorrelatedwiththelenssam-

Such galaxies are not expected to be efficiently lensed by our

galaxies in the source sample can be inferred by comparing
thenumberofsourcegalaxiesaroundthelenssamplewiththe
number of pairs around random points. If the source galaxies
are correlated, we expect the ratio of the two pair counts, also
called the boost factor, to be consistent with unity.
In Fig. 11, we show the boost factor for all three of our
lenssamples. Inthescalesofourinterestshownasthecolored

Just as in the case of the clustering signal we also quantify
thevariationofthegalaxy-galaxylensingsignalwithredshift.
We measure the galaxy-galaxy lensing signals in subsamples
of each redshift bin and present the result in each of the sub-
panels of Fig. 13. We fit these signals with a fiducial model
at the median redshift of the sample with fiducial cosmologi-
cal parameters with a free amplitude that varies with redshift
according to Eq. (33) and again obtain results which indicate19
a result consistent with no variation at the 2- ùúélevel (see Ta-
ble III). In addition, we also show the very weak dependence
of the weak lensing signal whether we use or do not use the
systematic weights related to the stellar density in the various
sub-panels of Fig. 12.

to a small-scale cut of 8arcmin, while the corresponding cut
forùúâ‚àíis equal to 30arcmin. On large scales, the scale cuts
are dictated by systematics in the measured signals as we will
describe below.
The measurements of the cosmic shear signals were per-
formed on the mock shape catalogs in order to obtain the
covariance of the cosmic shear signals. Note that the mock
catalogsthemselveswereconstructedwithouttheinclusionof
any multiplicative biases. Therefore, in order to estimate the
covariances for the three blind catalogs with non-zero multi-
plicative biases, we include the multiplicative bias in Eqs. (5)
and (6) by changing ùõæ‚Üí(1+ÀÜùëö)ùõæat the catalog level. The
values of the multiplicative bias ÀÜùëöare taken from the corre-
sponding blind catalog.
As mentioned in the previous section, the mocks were con-
structed based on the DNNzphotometric redshift estimates.
Wehavemeasuredthemockcosmicshearsignalswithgalaxies

ference in the number density of DNNzandDEmPzselected
source samples, we have rescaled the shot noise related term
in the covariance matrix.
The cross-correlation coefficient of the covariance matrix
obtained from our cosmic shear measurements can be seen
as two of the blocks in Fig. 6. Since the cosmic shear mea-

ùúâ+andùúâ‚àíare 20.2 and 19.0, respectively.

signals,ùúâùêµ,+andùúâùêµ,‚àícomputed using the measurements of
ùúâ+andùúâ‚àí, respectively, obtained using finer binning to avoid

any systematics) and present the mean from the mocks as a
dashed line. We compute the ùúí2per degree of freedom and
the p-value for the ùúí2to exceed the one measured in the data.
We use the mean mock measurement of the B-modes with
respect to the measured B-modes in our data for the above
purpose. We obtain reasonably good ùúí2values with large p-

of papers, based on imaging data obtained over a three year
period from the HSC survey and the spectroscopic data from
theSDSS,wewillpresentthecosmologicalconstraintsonthe
matter density parameter as well as the amplitude of density
fluctuations. In this paper, the first in the series, we presents
robust measurements and systematic tests corresponding to
the measurement of each of the above signals. A summary
of the results and products made available in this paper are as
follows:

lens galaxies from the large-scale structure samples
of SDSS BOSS galaxies. These subsamples are de-

use on scales of 0.5‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc> ùëÖ > 80‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc. Our
mock catalogs further mimic the footprint of the SDSS
survey.
‚Ä¢We have also generated 1404 mock shape catalogs of
galaxies by randomly rotating the ellipticities of galax-
ies in our HSC-Y3 shape catalog, and distorting them
with shears that would arise from the large-scale struc-
ture distribution in a ŒõCDM universe. These mock
catalogsaidinthecomputationofthecovarianceofthe23
two point measurements involving weak gravitational
lensing shears.
‚Ä¢We describe the codes and pipelines used to optimally
perform the three two-point correlation function mea-
surements on data as well as on the mock catalogs in
order to estimate the full covariance matrix of our ob-
servables.
‚Ä¢Based on the clustering pipeline, we present the mea-
surementsoftheprojectedclusteringsignalofthethree
subsamples of galaxies. In the range of scale cuts over
which we will perform our cosmological analyses with
the large-scale perturbation theory-based model (Paper
III),thesignal-to-noiseratiooftheclusteringsignalsare
25.6,27.6,26.6fortheLOWZ,CMASS1andCMASS2
subsamples, respectively. When including the small
scalesthatwillbemodelledinPaperII,thecorrespond-
ing signal-to-noise ratios are, 38.5,37.1,35.7, respec-
tively.
‚Ä¢We also show that the clustering signals within each
subsample do not change substantially irrespective of
the use of systematic weights, suggested by the SDSS
BOSS team, that are related to the the number density
of stars or the seeing in the SDSS imaging data used to
define the spectroscopic targets. We also show that the
clustering signal of our subsample of galaxies does not
showasubstantialevidenceforvariationwithindifferent
redshift bins.
‚Ä¢Using the weak lensing pipeline, we present our mea-
surementsofthegalaxy-galaxylensingsignalforeachof
ourlenssubsamplesusingthesinglesourcegalaxysam-
ple. For the large-scale analyses, the signal-to-noise ra-
tioofthegalaxy-galaxylensingsignalsare 7.6,11.3and
10.6, for the LOWZ, CMASS1, and CMASS2 subsam-
ples, respectively. The corresponding signal-to-noise
ratios for the measurements in the scales of interest rel-
evant to small-scale analysis are 13.4,17.3and15.8,
respectively.

while the smallest scales were chosen based on the ac-

‚Ä¢Finally,wealsopresentedourbestestimatesforthePSF

the PSF leakage and the residual PSF model error. The
values we obtain will be used in the cosmological anal-
yses to model the PSF systematics component of the
cosmic shear signal, in order to marginalize over these
nuisance parameters.
The measurements presented in this paper, the covariances
and the constraints on parameter systematics have been used
in the 3√ó2pt analysis of the data to infer the constraints on
the cosmological parameters Œ©mandùúé8, in particular the pa-
rameter combination, ùëÜ8. These results will be presented in
our companion papers Sugiyama et al.[42] and Miyatake et
al.[41].
The Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam survey has also finished
collecting data from its entirety of operations which spanned
330 nights in total. The wide survey area which is the most
useful in terms of its cosmological constraining power will
span a total of about 1100 sq. deg. Numerous challenges
will be involved in the processing of data with such statistical
power,inparticular,tokeepthesystematicerrorbudgetunder
control. As we will show in the companion papers, the pho-
tometricredshiftuncertaintiesarestillourdominantsourceof
errors. Addressing this challenge using additional measure-
ments, better data as well as innovative techniques is going to
be a necessary task before the arrival of data from the Rubin
LSST.

[91] The gap in the redshift distributions between LOWZ and
CMASS samples is due to our use of the SDSS DR11 parent
sample. Using the latest DR12 catalog would have allowed us
to add in a few more galaxies at intermediate redshifts. How-
ever, that would have required us to modify the BOSS large
scalestructuresampletoincludethefibercollidedandredshift
failure galaxies. Since this procedure was already performed
for DR11, we decided to stick with this sample.

[103] One may think that the factor of 1.08is not enough because
the blue contour does not cover the green contour in Fig. 18.
Dependingontheflags, i_calib_psf_used=True orFalse,we
not only use different coefficients but also different ùúâpp,pq,qq,
and the difference is not so significant in predicted ÀÜùúâpsfthan
how it appears in Fig. 18.
Appendix A: Systematic differences in the inferred redshift
distribution
AsshowninFig.2,weseedifferencesintheinferredredshift
distributionofoursourcesampledependinguponwhetherwe
use the redshift PDFs from DEmPzorDNNz. We estimate
the potential biases in the measured weak lensing signals due
to these systematic uncertainties.
Forthegalaxy-galaxylensingsignalthissystematicbiascan
bequantifiedbycomputingtheaverageratioofthecriticalsur-
face density of the source sample (described in Section IIA)
by utilizing the inferred redshifts from either of the two esti-
mates. Wecomputethisratiobyusingthemedianredshiftsof
each of our lens samples (described in Section IIC). We find
that for the LOWZ sample the critical surface density based
ontheredshiftsinferredbasedon DEmPzishigherby1.7per-
cent compared to those inferred based on DNNz, while this
difference grows to 3.3 and 4.2 percent for the CMASS1 and
CMASS2 subsamples.28
For the cosmic shear signal, we compute the theoretical
estimate ofùúâ+andùúâ‚àífor the source sample for the Planck
cosmological model using either of the two inferred redshift
distributions. For the cosmic shear signal, we also find that
the signals based on the redshifts inferred from DEmPzis
predicted to be about 6 percent higher than that from DNNz.
We would like to have a simple way to parameterize these
differencesandmarginalizeovertheminourcosmologyanaly-
sis. Wefindthattheaverageredshiftofthesourcesamplebased
ontheinferredredshiftdistributionfrom DEmPzishigherthan
that of DNNzbyŒî¬Øùëßof0.04. If we simply shift the inferred
redshift distribution from DEmPzlower by the same amount
whilemaintainingtheshapeoftheredshiftdistribution,wecan
account for almost all of the differences. When such a shift is
included,theratiosofthevaluesofthecriticalsurfacedensity
for each of the lens subsamples is reduced to sub-percent lev-
els(<0.75percent),whilethecosmicshearsignalsalsoagree
at the sub percent level. We recommend the use of such Œîùëß
in the systematic uncertainty analyses for cosmological infer-
ence. This is particularly important because we do not have
any clustering measurements which can constrain the redshift
PDFs at high redshifts for our source galaxy sample.
As will be shown in our companion paper Miyatake et
al.[41], using the self calibration technique of Oguri and
Takada [60], there are hints that support a value of Œîùëßof the
order‚àí0.06(albeitatlowsignificance),indicatingthatthetrue
meanredshiftsmaypossiblybeevenhigherthanthatsuggested
byDEmPz.
Appendix B: The variation of the signal in the redshift bin with
BOSS full sample
Inthissection,wepresentthevariationoftheclusteringsig-
nalwiththeBOSSfullsample,i.ethefluxlimitedsample. We
usedallthegalaxiesintheSDSSDR11BOSScatalogs,rather
thanapplyingtheluminositycutsusedinthemainpartofthis
paper. UsingthisBOSSfullsample,wetestedthevariationof
the clustering signal in each redshift in a similar way as Sec-
tionIVB:wedividethegalaxiesintothreeortwosubsamples
in each redshift bin and measure the clustering signal in each
subsample. Fig.20showsthevariationoftheclusteringsignal
in each redshift bin using the BOSS full sample. Comparing
to Fig. 9, we can find that the flux limited sample shows the
strongervariation,indicatingastrongerevolutionofthegalaxy
property as a function of redshift. Therefore, the luminosity
limited sample has almost the same galaxy property, and we
can model the galaxy physics with a single set of the galaxy-
related parameters, e.g. the HOD parameters or galaxy bias
parameter,withoutaccountingfortheredshiftevolutionofthe
galaxy-related parameters in the model in each redshift bin.
Appendix C: Measurements with DNNzandMizuki
Inthisappendix,wepresenttheweaklensingmeasurements
and the systematics tests but for the source samples selected
using DNNzandMizuki, respectively. The upper and lowerpanels of Fig. 21 present the cross signal measured for the
three subsamples of lenses we use for our measurements for
thetwodifferentsourcesamples. Thesamecommentsapplyas
wereobservedforthe DEmPzbasedsourcesample,aswritten
in Sec.VA. We apply the same scale cuts and show the ùúí2
and the corresponding p-values in Table IV for the large and
small-scale analyses, respectively.
Wealsocomputetheboostfactorsforthecorrespondinglens
subsamples to estimate the contamination of the signal due to
galaxiesphysicallyassociatedwiththelenssample. Theseare
showninFig22. Thedeviationofthesesignalsfromunityand
thevaluesofthecorresponding ùúí2perdegreeoffreedomand
the p-values, on scales that we will use for our cosmological
analyses are listed in Table V.
The B-modes from the cosmic shear measurements for the
source subsamples selected by the two methods are shown
in Figs. 23. In the scales that we consider for our analyses,
the B-mode signals are consistent with zero, as in the fiducial
analysis.
Thegalaxy-galaxylensingmeasurements,thecosmicshear
measurements as well as the redshift distributions for the
source samples will be presented in electronic form on the
data repository.
Appendix D: A problematic region in GAMA09H field
We have computed the cosmic shear signal using source
galaxies selected from DEmPzfrom the entire full depth full
color region of the HSC-Y3 shape catalog. In Fig. 24, we
present the B-mode signals measured based on ùúâ+andùúâ‚àíand
compareittothemeanexpectationfrommockshapecatalogs.
The p-value for the B-modes computed from ùë•ùëñ+show some-
what low values of 0.07, although it is not troublingly low.
However, when we had performed this analysis previously
with a sample based on DNNzselection, we have noticed un-
acceptablylowp-values,drivenpartlybythelargeramplitude
of the B-mode signal from ùúâ+, and the erratic behaviour of
the B-mode signal from ùúâ‚àí. By performing a field-by-field
analysis with the DNNzsample, we were able to track down
suchoddbehaviourtooneofthesubfieldswithinHSC,namely
GAMA09H. We were able to identify a 20sq degree region
boundedbyrightascensionbetween 132.5and140.0degand
declinationbetween 1.6and4.7deg. Wehavenotbeenableto
entirelytrackdownthecauseofthisissueyet,butempirically
this excluded region includes an area which was observed in
someofthebestseeingconditions. Therefore,tobeonthesafe
side, we carry out all our measurements of the galaxy-galaxy
lensing signal and the cosmic shear signal by excluding that
particular patch of the sky.
Appendix E: Analytic expression of magnification bias
covariance
In this section, we derive the analytic expression of mag-
nification bias effect on the cross-covariance between galaxy-
galaxy lensing signal and cosmic shear signal. We consider29
