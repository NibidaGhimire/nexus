Abstract : 
The development of versatile robots capable of traversing challenging and irregular 
environments is of increasing interest in the field of robotics, and metameric robots have been 
identified as a promising solution due to their slender, deformable bodies. Inspired by the 
effective locomotion of earthworms, earthworm -like robots capable of both rectilinear and 
planar l ocomotion have been designed and prototyped.  While much research has focused on 
developing kinematic models to describe the planar locomotion of earthworm -like robots, the 
authors argue that the development of dynamic models is critical to improving the ac curacy 
and efficiency of these robots. A comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of a metemeric 
earthworm -like robot capable of planar motion is presented in this work. The model takes into 
account the complex interactions between the robot's deformable bod y and the forces acting on 
it, and draws on the methods previously used to develop mathematical models of snake -like 
robots. The proposed model represents a significant advancement in the field of metameric 
robotics and has the potential to enhance the per formance of earthworm -like robots in a variety 
of challenging environments, such as underground pipes and tunnels, and serves as a 
foundation for future research into the dynamics of soft -bodied robots.

 1 Introduction  
Recent years have seen an increasing need and interest in developing locomotion robots due to 
the urgent requirement to liberate workers from tasks in rugged and hazardous environment s. 
For confined work spaces and irregular work environments, traditional wheeled and legged 
locomotion robots face major limitations such as inefficient movement and low adaptability to 
continuously changing environments [1,2]. Instead, metameric robots enable readily traveling 
within unstructured environments and versatility in diverse working conditions due to their 
slender bodies and deformable components [3–6]. 
In particular, many metameric robots are inspired by the earthworms [7–11] for their 
effective locomotion in a variety of environments, especially in confined spaces such as 
underground caves . The slender body of earthworms consists of many deformable segments 
that can be stretched, contracted, and curved by control of embedded longitudinal and 
circumferential muscles  [12,13]. The robotics field has greatly benefited from mimicking the 
locomotion of the earthworm, with a wealth of new robotic designs and prototypes being 
proposed for scenarios such as earthquake rescue, industrial pipeline inspection, and t errain 
exploration  [14–16]. 
For common earthworm -like robots that p erform 1 -D rectilinear motions in pipes, many 
models have been developed by mimicking the segmentation of the earthworm and reproducing 
the retrograde peristalsis waves[8,9,17,18]. In this regard, some kinematic and dynamic  models 
describing the rectilinear locomotion of th e earthworm -like robot have been proposed to 
evaluate the locomotion performance of the robot and to further optimize the gaits [19–23]. Other 
than rectilinear locomotion, earthworms in nature are capable of effective planar locomotion. 
By differentially contracting or s tretching the longitudinal muscles on the left and right sides, 
the earthworm can bend its body and tur n [13]. Motivated by this observation, several 
earthworm -like robots capable of planar locomotion have been designed and prototyped, the 
main idea being to make the left and right sides of the segment unequally deformed[10,16,24]. 
Many body segments and various segmental states permit earthworm -like robots with good 
mobility and abundant locomotion gaits. Despit e the progresses in achieving effective planar 
locomotion of earthworm -like robots, the theoretical descriptions of planar locomotion are 
currently largely resting on kinematic models, and the resulting discrepancies between theory 
and experiment necessita te further efforts in the dynamic modeling of the planar locomotion 
of the earthworm -like robots  [10,25].

 In addition, due to the similarity between earthworm -like robots and snake -like robots in 
terms of planar locomotion, one line of thought is to learn the dynamics model of the 
earthworm -like robot from the snake -like robo t. The mathematical models of planar snake 
robot dynamics have previously been developed  [26,27], and the initial form of the model 
presented in this work is developed using the same approach as in these works.

In the proposed model of the earthworm -like robot (F igure 1) , each segment (denoted by 
a dashed box) consists of a pair of idealized massless displacement actuator and a rigid body 
of mass 
m  and moment of inertia 
2/3 J ml=  located on the right. Figure 1a dis plays an 
n
-segment model of the metameric robot. To satisfy kinematics, an additional rigid body is added 
at the back end of the model. Hence, the n-segment model consists of 
1n+   rigid bodies 
interconnected by 
n  pairs of displacement actuators.  
For each two adjacent rigid bodies, the distance of the left and right ends are accurately 
and independently controlled by an ideal displacement actuator, respectively. Assumed that the 
contraction directions o n both sides are parallel to each other and form an isosceles trapezoid 
with the two rigid bodies as illustrated in Figur e 1, the translation and rotation between adjacent

We can write the translation constraints (1.a) and (1.b) for all the segments of the robot

It now remains to remo ve the joint constraint forces from (7). Premultiplying (5.a) and

 In this research, the head displacement 
1x   and the head velocity 
1x
   are respectively 
employed to characteriz e the displacement and velocity of the robot as a whole. The linear 
displacement and the angular displacement of each rigid body can be expressed in terms of the 
displacement of the head body according to (1.a), (1.b) and (1.c), which gives

To provide anisotropic friction, the brush structure is attached to the bottom of the segment. 
The brushes are tilted back

  with very sharp side edges so t hat the robotic segment is 
subjected to little friction when pulled/pushed forward, but can grip rough surfaces when

3 Experimental verifications  
In this section, we use the six -segment earthworm -like robot to verify the predicted 
locomotion modes and the corresponding kine matics characteristics.  Here, we select some  
typical gaits which correspond to rectilinear, sidewinding,  and circular locomotion, 
respectively  to verify the locomotion characteristi cs. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show the  actuation 
signals  and experimental data  of the robot for the three mode s, and for reference, the theoretical 
trajectories are given in the insets.

experimental average velocities  and radius  of the circular  locomotion.  (c) Displacement -time histories 
of the robot head under the circu lar gait. (d) Snapshots of the robot during the circular  locomotion.  
 
The simulations based on the dynamic model are shown to agree more with the 
experimental results than the kinematic model, as revealed in Fig. 2 (b), (c), Fig. 3 (b), (c) and 
Fig. 4 (b), (c). The kinematic model, on the other hand, deviates significantly from 
experimental results in predicting the slope of the sidewinding locomotion trajectory and the 
velocity of the circular locomotion. In contrast, the dynamic model gives reasonable 
predictions for these parameters. This is further supported by the displacement -time histories 
of the robot head, where the dynamic simulations' trajectories match experimental trajectories 
better than those of the kinematic simulations. However, although the dynamic model improves 
predictions by accounting for inertial and frictional forces, some deviations between the 
predicted and experimental results still exist, such as higher average velocities and larger 
predicted radii of trajectories in worm -like recti linear locomotion. There are several possible 
explanations for these differences. First, the assumption of ideal actuation may not be accurate, 
meaning that the worm -like segments cannot defo rm as intended. Second, although the current 
dynamic model has incorporated forward, backward, and lateral friction, actual planar 
locomotion involves variable friction between the robot segment and the ground in different 
directions, with inconsistent fri ction coefficients at different ground locations, and floor gaps 
that can impact robot motion. Third, sideslips have an impact on robot locomotion, as in the 
case of sidewinding locomotion, where internal forces cause the head segment to be pulled 
back sli ghtly by the posterior segments, resulting in negative displacements in the y -direction, 
 
 11 / 12 
 or circular locomotion, where sideslip increases the radius of the trajectory. Fourth, the worm -
like locomotion assumes that snake -like joints remain in the neutral po sition, but slight 
rotations may occur during the experiment due to joint torques. Finally, manual fabrication 
errors can result in a non -standard isosceles trapezoid shape when one side of the worm -like 
module is contracted.  
4 Conclusion  
A comprehensive a nalysis of the dynamics of a metamer -like earthworm robot capable of 
planar motion is presented in this work. The model takes into account the complex interactions 
between the robot's deformable body and the forces acting on it. The verification of the mod el 
through simulations shows that the dynamic model agrees more with experimental results than 
the kinematic model. However, there are still deviations between the predicted and 
experimental results, indicating that further research is needed. In conclusio n, the proposed 
dynamic model for the earthworm -like robot's planar motion represents a significant 
advancement in the field of metameric robotics. This work is a crucial step towards unlocking 
the full potential of soft -bodied robots and advancing the fie ld of Metameric robotics.
