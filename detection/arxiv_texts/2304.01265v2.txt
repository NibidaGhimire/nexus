Due to coherent superradiant amplification, massive bosonic fields can trigger an instability in
spinning black holes, tapping their energy and angular momentum and forming macroscopic Bose-
Einstein condensates around them. This phenomenon produces gaps in the mass-spin distribution of
astrophysical black holes, a continuous gravitational-wave signal emitted by the condensate, and
several environmental effects relevant for gravitational-wave astronomy and radio images of black
holes. While the spectrum of superradiantly unstable mode is known in great detail for massive
scalar (spin-0) and vector (spin-1) perturbations, so far only approximated results were derived for
the case of massive tensor (spin-2) fields, due to the nonseparability of the field equations. Here,
solving a system of ten elliptic partial differential equations, we close this program and compute the
spectrum of the most unstable modes of a massive spin-2 field for generic black-hole spin and boson
mass, beyond the hydrogenic approximation and including the unique dipole mode that dominates
the instability in the spin-2 case. We find that the instability timescale for this mode is orders of
magnitude shorter than for any other superradiant mode, yielding much stronger constraints on
massive spin-2 fields. These results pave the way for phenomenological studies aimed at constraining
beyond Standard Model scenarios, ultralight dark matter candidates, and extensions to General
Relativity using gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations, and have implications for the
phase diagram of vacuum solutions of higher-dimensional gravity.
Introduction. Ultralight bosons (such as the QCD ax-
ion, axion-like particles, dark photons, etc [ 1–4]) are pre-
dicted in several beyond Standard Model scenarios [ 2,4–
6], including extra dimensions and string theories, and
are compelling dark matter candidates. Searching for
these fields in the laboratory is challenging due to their
typically weak coupling to baryonic matter, but they
might produce striking effects around astrophysical black
holes (BHs) [ 1,7–14]. This possibility is allowed by the
superradiant instability of spinning BHs against massive
bosonic excitations [ 15–18], which occurs whenever the
frequency ωRof the perturbation satisfies the superradi-
ant condition 0 < ωR< mΩH, where Ω His the horizon
angular velocity and mis the azimuthal quantum num-
ber of the unstable mode (see [ 8] for an overview). As
an order-of-magnitude estimate, for a boson with mass
mb=µℏ, the superradiant instability is most effective
when its Compton wavelength is comparable to the BH
gravitational radius, i.e. when the gravitational coupling
α≡Mµ=O(0.1) (in the geometrized G=c= 1 units
henceforth adopted). This translates into the optimal
condition for the instability mb∼10−11(M⊙/M)eVbut,
as we shall see, in certain cases the range of relevant
masses for which the instability is efficient can encom-
pass several orders of magnitude. In the superradiant
regime the BH spins down, transferring energy and an-
gular momentum to a mostly dipolar ( m= 1) boson
condensate until ωR∼ΩHand the instability quenches

§jss55@cam.ac.ukoff. The condensate is then primarily dissipated through
the emission of almost monochromatic quadrupolar grav-
itational waves [ 7,19], with frequency set by the boson
mass. This process continues for m > 1 modes on longer
timescales [8, 20].
While the qualitative aspects of this phenomenon are
valid for any boson regardless of its spin, a crucial ingre-
dient is the instability timescale of the dominant unstable
mode, which strongly depends on αand type of mas-
sive boson [8]. Scalar (spin-0) fields are the best studied
case [ 7,9–11,16,21–23], but recent years have witnessed
a significant progress also for vector (spin-1) fields [ 24–
34]. Massive tensor (spin-2) perturbations are much less
understood. In this case the superradiant instability has
been studied only perturbatively using a semi-analytical
approach [ 35] to first order in the spin [ 36] and analyti-
cally in the so-called Newtonian regime where α≪1 [14].
However, the former approximation is inaccurate for most
astrophysical BHs given their sizable spin [ 37–39], while
the latter approximation is inaccurate in the most relevant
regime for the instability, α=O(0.1), and also fails to
capture the “special” dipole mode found numerically in
Ref. [ 36], which was conjectured to be the dominant one.
Here we close an important gap in the BH superradi-
ance program by computing the superradiant instability
of a Kerr BH against massive spin-2 fields without ap-
proximations and for any mode. We extend the methods
developed in Refs. [ 40–52] (see [ 49] for an overview) and
write the linearized field equations as a coupled system
of ten elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with
associated boundary conditions yielding an eigenvalue
problem in the frequency domain.
In particular we will show that the instability timescale
of the special dipole mode is dramatically shorter thanarXiv:2304.01265v2  [gr-qc]  21 Sep 20232
for any other superradiantly unstable mode, reaching
timescales comparable to the typical BH ringdown [ 50–53]
(as short as τ∼2×10−4(M/M ⊙) s for a highly-spinning
BH), and being effective in a much wider region of the
parameter space.
Setup. At variance with scalar and vector fields, the
coupling of a massive spin-2 field to gravity is highly non-
trivial [ 54–58]. Here we will consider the field equations
for a spin-2 perturbation Habon a Ricci-flat background
which is taken to be the Kerr solution [ 59], although
our computation does not depend on the details of the
background and should be valid also for other stationary
and axisymmetric solutions that might exist in bimetric
theories [ 60,61]. The perturbed equations, describing the
propagation of five physical degrees of freedom, are [ 36,62]
□Hab+ 2RabcdHcd−µ2Hab= 0, (1a)
∇aHab= 0, Ha
a= 0, (1b)
where□=∇a∇aandRabcdare the D’Alembert operator
and Riemann tensor of the background, respectively, and
the first two terms describe the familiar Lichnerowicz
operator (∆ LH)ab. We shall discuss the embedding of
these equations in various nonlinear theories later on.
In the standard Boyer-Lindquist coordinates ( t, r, θ, ϕ )
for the Kerr metric, ∂tand ∂ϕare Killing vector
fields, so one can decompose Habalong those directions:
Hab(t, r, θ, ϕ ) =e−iωteimϕ˜Hab(r, θ). The resulting field
equations for ˜Habare a coupled system of ten PDEs (of
which five are constraints arising from Eq. (1b)) which,
after imposing boundary conditions, yield a eigenvalue
problem in the (complex) frequency ω=ωR+i ωI, for a
given mode m(details in the Appendix).
The system of PDEs is then discretized using a pseu-
dospectral collocation grid on Gauss-Chebyshev-Lobbato
points in the compactified directions y∈[0,1] and x∈
[−1,1], defined as r=r+/(1−y2) and cosθ=x√
2−x2,
where r+=M(1 +p
1−χ2) is the BH event horizon and
χ≡J/M2≤1 is the dimensionless BH angular momen-
tum. The eigenfrequencies and associated eigenfunctions
are found through a Newton-Raphson root-finding algo-
rithm after imposing suitable boundary conditions for
unstable modes [ 41,49]. The latter impose an exponen-
tial decay at asymptotic infinity ( y→1), regularity of the
perturbations in ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordi-
nates at the horizon ( y→0), and regularity on the north
and south poles of the two-sphere, which also requires m
to be an integer. More details about the formulation of
the problem and numerical method are presented in the
Appendix.
Instability spectrum. Compared to the scalar and
vector cases, massive spin-2 perturbations have two unique
features, emerging already in the nonspinning case: i) an
unstable spherical ( m= 0) mode [ 36,63] which signals
the existence of hairy BH solutions [ 60]; ii) a special dipole
polar mode [ 36], which does not fit within the general
hydrogenic-like scaling found in the analytical Newtonian

where ℓ≥0,n≥0, and the integer S= (0,±1,±2) are
the mode total angular momentum, overtone number,
and polarization, respectively, with m∈[−ℓ, ℓ]. The
sign change of ωIdue to the term ωR−mΩHmakes
it clear that modes with m≥1 turn unstable in the
superradiant regime, with an instability timescale τ=
1/ωI. As predicted by (2b), the dominant hydrogenic
spin-2 mode (with ℓ= 2 = −S) has a parametrically
longer timescale compared to the dominant hydrogenic
spin-1 mode (with ℓ= 1 = −S) [14]. On the other
hand, the special dipole ( m= 1) spin-2 mode computed
numerically in the nonspinning case displays a different
behavior [36]:
ωdipole
R
µ≈0.72(1−α), ωdipole
I∝α3µ . (3)
Thus, in the nonspinning case this mode has the largest3
binding energy, ωR/µ−1, and the shortest decay time of
the entire spectrum for massive bosonic perturbations.
Our numerical method is general and applies to all
unstable modes. Indeed, we have confirmed numerically
the analytical results for the hydrogenic modes, Eqs. (2a)–
(2b). Henceforth we focus on the special dipole mode,
since [ 36] found indication that ωdipole
I∝α3(ωR−mΩH)
to leading order in the BH spin ( m= 1), suggesting the
shortest instability timescale in the superradiant regime.
In Fig. 1 we show the behavior of this special mode for
generic BH spin χand for a large range of gravitational
coupling up to α= 0.8. While we confirm the results
of Ref. [ 36] in the nonspinning case, the most striking
feature of this mode emerges in the regime that was not
possible to explore so far, namely large BH spins and large
coupling. For nearly extremal BHs, we find that this mode
has an imaginary part as large as ωIM≈0.019 when
α≈0.8. This translates into the instability timescale
τ≈2.6×10−4M

almost two orders of magnitude shorter than for any
other superradiant mode known so far, including the
dominant unstable mode in the massive spin-1 case [ 33]
and any other massive spin-2 modes. Interestingly, as
shown by the inset in Fig. 1, the dominant quasinormal
mode of a highly-spinning Kerr BH [ 50–53] has a decay
time comparable to, or even longer than, (4). This means
that the instability is so fast that it would affect the
ringdown of a newly formed BH.

BH mass-spin gaps. A generic prediction of superradi-
ant instabilities is that highly-spinning BHs should lose an-
gular momentum over a timescale τ= 1/ωIthat might be
much shorter than typical astrophysical timescales. Thus,
if ultralight bosons exist in the Universe they would lead
to statistical evidence for slowly rotating BHs in a region
of the “Regge” plane (mass versus angular momentum)
of astrophysical BHs [ 8,10,11,30,64–69]. Given a mb,
there exists a forbidden region (a gap [ 64]) in the Regge
plane wherein the instability timescale is shorter than
known spin-up astrophysical processes such as accretion.
The exclusion regions in the Regge plane are shown in
the left panel of Fig. 2 for selected values of mb, whereas inthe right panel we compare the exclusion region obtained
in this work with those of other superradiant modes for
the same representative value mb= 10−16eV. Owing
to the much shorter instability timescale, our exclusion
region encompasses several orders of magnitude, ranging
from stellar to supermassive BHs, for the same mb.
Data points shown in Fig. 2 refer to several obser-
vations: (i)Black points denote electromagnetic esti-
mates of the mass and spin of accreting stellar and su-
permassive BHs [ 37,38], conservatively requiring that
τ < τ S= 4.5×107yr, where τSis the Salpeter timescale
for accretion. We also include some recent candidates
of spinning intermediate-mass BHs, although mass-spin
measurements for these sources might be sensitive to mod-
elling systematics [ 70,71].(ii)Red points are the 90%
confidence levels for the binary BHs in a selection of the
merger events detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA col-
laboration so far [ 72,73] (using the errors on the binary
effective spin [ 74] as a proxy for the errors on the individ-
ual spins). While individual spin measurements coming
from current gravitational-wave events have large errors,
some binaries have confidently nonvanishing spins [ 39,75]
and future LIGO detections will provide measurements
of the individual spins with ≈30% accuracy [ 76]. Much
more accurate spin measurements of binary BHs out to
cosmological distances will come from the future LISA
mission [ 77] for intermediate and supermassive objects,
mainly depending on the mass of BH seeds in the early
Universe (the horizontal arrows in Fig. 2 denote the range
of projected mass measurements with LISA using three
different population models for supermassive BHs [ 11,78]).
This would allow searching for ultralight bosons in a large
mass range mb∈(10−19,10−13)eV, much wider than in
previous cases [ 10,11,69,79].(iii) Green points are
the 90% confidence levels for the mass-spin of a selection
of the merger remnants [ 39,72,75], which also identify
targets of merger follow-up searches [ 7,9,13,30,80]. In
the particular case at hand, it is tantalizing that |ωI|
can be comparable to or even larger than the typical |ωI|
of a BH quasinormal mode [ 50–53] (see Fig. 1). This
implies that the instability would directly affect the post-
merger phase by dynamically reducing the spin of the
remnant during the ringdown, which does not happen for
any other superradiant mode. (iv)The blue points refer
to Cyg X-1 [ 81] and LMC X-3 [ 82], for which there are
reliable spin measurements suggesting that the spin is
constant over O(10yr) [38]. In these cases, more direct
constraints come by imposing τ <O(10yr) [79]. Given
the strong instability, these sources could confidently ex-
clude spin-2 particles with mass mb∈(10−15,5×10−12).
(v)Finally, the two gray points correspond to the masses
of SgrA∗and M87 as measured by the Event Horizon
Telescope [ 83–85]. While an accurate spin measurement
for these sources is still not available, they are expected
to have moderate to large spin [ 85–87]. Given the extent
of the exclusion regions in Fig. 2, any spin measurement
in SgrA∗and M87 that confidently excludes zero would
approximately rule out the range mb∈[10−23,10−17]eV,4

which is much wider than the exclusion regions derived
with other modes [ 88–90]. Likewise, if some of the ultra-
massive BHs with M≃few×1010M⊙[91–93] (rightmost
black data point in the left panel of Fig. 2) were confirmed
to have nonzero spin [ 94], it would be possible to exclude
an ultralight spin-2 field with mass even slightly smaller
than mb≈10−23eV.
Embeddings of the model. At the nonlinear level,
there is a unique way to couple a dynamical spin-2 field to
gravity [ 55–57,95]. Nonetheless, Eqs. (1a)–(1b)emerge
from linear perturbations in several different contexts.
In ghost-free massive gravity [ 55], these equations de-
scribe the linear dynamics of a massive graviton when
considering a Ricci-flat reference metric. In the context
of bimetric theories [ 56,57], they describe the dynamics
of perturbations propagating on a fixed background given
by two copies of the same Ricci-flat metric.
Interestingly, Eqs. (1a)–(1b) also arise from BH pertur-
bations in Einstein-Weyl gravity [96]
S=Z
d4x√−g
R−β

, (6)
where Cabcdis the Weyl tensor. This theory propagates a
massless graviton and a massive spin-2 field and (although
the latter has ghosts [ 97]) it has a number of unique fea-
tures: it is renormalizable in Minkowski spacetime [ 97],
admits all solutions of vacuum General Relativity, and has
a well-posed initial value problem even if the correspond-
ing field equations are of fourth order [ 98]. By linearizing
the theory on a Ricci-flat background [ 99], the equations
for the perturbed Ricci tensor take the form (1a)–(1b)
upon identification Hab≡δRabandµ2≡1/β. Thus, in
the strongly-coupled regime ( β→ ∞ ) the theory propa-
gates only a massive graviton with small effective mass,
and our bounds on µcan be directly translated intobounds on the coupling β, which are notoriously very
hard to place.
Finally, Eqs. (1a)–(1b) emerge also in the context of
higher-dimensional gravity when studying linear pertur-
bations of a five-dimensional ( d= 5) black string – ob-
tained by adding a flat direction to the Schwarzschild or
Kerr BH – and performing a Fourier decomposition with
Fourier momentum k≡µalong the extra dimension [ 100].
For example, the aforementioned spherical ( m= 0) unsta-
ble mode [ 63], present for α≤αcrit≈0.438 in the static
case, corresponds to the familiar Gregory-Laflamme in-
stability of a black string under fragmentation [ 100–102].
The onset of this instability in d= 5 signals a new branch
of nonuniform black strings [ 103–121] which corresponds,
ind= 4, to hairy BHs of massive gravity [60].
A natural extension of our work is to track the m= 0
mode in the spinning case to obtain accurate estimates for
αcrit(χ) [122] and associated timescales. Given the large
domain of existence and the short timescale of the special
dipole mode, it would be relevant to assess whether there
exists a range of αin which the m= 0 instability is absent
or weak, whereas the m= 1 instability discussed here is
dominant. Work in d= 6 dimensions [ 119–121] suggests
that such a window might indeed exist.
In all nonlinear completions aforementioned, the spe-
cial dipole mode is marginally stable ( ωI= 0) when the
superradiant condition is saturated, ω= Ω H(as a fur-
ther check of our code we confirmed this feature to very
high accuracy). A purely real mode at the linear level
strongly suggests the existence of a nonlinear stationary
solution branching off the critical point [ 49,123–126]. For
special black strings in d= 6 (with enhanced symme-
tries that reduce Eqs. (1a)–(1b) to ODEs) the superra-
diant onset signals the existence of new rotating black
strings – denoted as resonator [ 120] and helical [ 121]5
black strings – that are time-periodic (but not time inde-
pendent neither axisymmetric) since they have a helical
Killing vector field. Returning to d= 5, the instability
onset in Fig. 1 is similarly expected to signal black res-
onator/helical strings bifurcating from the Kerr string in
a phase diagram of solutions. From the d= 4 perspective,
this should correspond to the existence of novel hairy
rotating BHs of massive/bimetric/Einstein-Weyl grav-
ity with a single helical Killing vector field that would
have higher entropy than the Kerr BH. It would be in-
teresting to find such solutions which are expected to
have properties very different from the hairy BHs with
scalar/vector hair [ 124,127] (see [ 128] for a review), as
it occurs for systems in anti-de Sitter with similar super-
radiant physics [ 47,123,129,130]. Yet, when emerging
dynamically as the end-state or metastable state of the
instability, these solutions would have an angular momen-
tum close to the superradiant threshold, so our bounds
derived from BH mass-spin measurements are robust.
Conclusion. We have shown that the special dipole
spin-2 mode of a spinning BH does not fit in the standard
hydrogenic-like picture of superradiantly unstable modes
of massive bosonic perturbations. Most importantly, it
has by far the shortest instability timescale among all
superradiant modes. This has several direct consequences
which are unique to massive spin-2 fields. First of all, in
the highly-spinning case the instability timescale can be
comparable to or even larger than the dominant quasinor-
mal mode of a Kerr BH. This indicates that the instability
can be effective during the ringdown in a post-merger
phase, and suggests the need for novel ringdown-based
searches accounting for this effect. Furthermore, the exclu-
sion regions in the BH mass-spin diagram are much wider
than for other superradiant modes. In particular, the same
ultralight boson mass (around mb≈10−16eV) would give
rise to interesting phenomenology for both stellar-mass
and supermassive BHs, facilitating possible multiband
constraints on the model. The exclusion regions for each
mbextend almost up to χ≈0, showing that anyBH
spin measurement can be translated into interesting con-
straints. Owing to the wideness of the BH mass-spin gaps,
the range of detectable spin-2 masses is much larger than
in all other cases explored so far. For example, current
observations of stellar-mass BHs (either in the electromag-
netic or in the gravitational-wave band) exclude the region
mb∈[5×10−17,5×10−11]eV, which already severely
constrains the observability of dipolar radiation from BH
binaries in these models [ 131,132]. Overall, few BH mass-
spin measurements distributed in the region M∼M⊙to
M∼1010M⊙would probe massive spin-2 fields in the im-
pressive range mb∈[10−23,10−10]eV, which also includes
mb∼10−22eV, where ultralight bosons are compelling
dark-matter candidates [ 4]. To the best of our knowledge,
there are no other constraints on ultralight spin-2 fields
in this mass range, so superradiant instabilities provide
us with a unique discovery opportunity.
A natural extension of our work is to use these new
unstable modes to compute the rich phenomenology as-sociated with the gravitational-wave emission from the
bosonic condensate [ 9–14,30,80,133,134], as well as
environmental effects of the condensate in BH binary in-
spirals [ 135–144] and for radio images [ 88–90]. Due to
the stronger instability, these effects are anticipated to be
much more prominent than in other cases studied so far.

work with a compact radial coordinate y∈[0,1] and with
a new polar coordinate x∈[−1,1] related to the standard
Boyer-Lindquist coordinates ( r, θ) by
r=r+
1−y2, cosθ=xp
2−x2. (A4)
It is further useful to work with the dimensionless quanti-
ties1
ea=a
r+,eω=ω r+,eµ=µ r+,
eTH=THr+,eΩH= ΩHr+. (A5)
In these conditions, the perturbed equations (1a)-(1b) in
the main text describe a coupled system of ten PDEs for
˜Hab(y, x), where five of them are the transverse and the
traceless constraints (1b), as detailed next. The trace-
less condition gives an algebraic equation for ˜Httas a
function of {˜Hyy,˜Hxx,˜Hϕϕ}. This algebraic equation to-
gether with other nine equations constitute a minimal set
of equations that close the full system of perturbed equa-
tions. These nine equations are the four transverse condi-
tions in (1b) and the five components {xx, xy, xϕ, yy, yϕ }
of (1a). The ten unknown functions are ˜Hab(y, x) with
{ab}={tt, tx, ty, tϕ, xx, xy, xϕ, yy, yϕ, ϕϕ }. After impos-
ing the appropriate physical boundary conditions for un-
stable modes, the coupled system of the nine PDEs plus
the algebraic equation for ˜Httyields an eigenvalue prob-
lem in the (complex) frequency eω=eωR+ieωI.To discuss the boundary conditions2, first note that
unstable modes have frequencies whose real part is smaller
than the potential barrier height set by the spin-2 field
mass, ωR< µ. A Frobenius analysis at the essential
singularity located at the asymptotic infinity y= 1 finds
that unstable modes must decay as
˜Hab
y→1∼e−√
eµ2−eω2
1−y2(1−y2)−n−(1+ea2)(eµ2−2eω2)
2√
eµ2−eω2,(A6)
where, as a boundary condition, we have already elim-
inated a solution that grows unbounded at infinity as
e√
eµ2−eω2/(1−y2)and one has n= 0 for {ab}={ty, tϕ},
n= 1 for {ab}={tx, yy, yϕ, ϕϕ },n= 2 for {ab}=
{xy, xϕ }andn= 3 for {ab}={xx}.
At the horizon, regularity of the m= 1 perturbation in
ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates requires that
we impose the boundary condition,
˜Hab
y→0∼y−p−ieω−eΩH
2πeTH, (A7)
which effectively excludes outgoing modes,
∼yi(eω−eΩH)/(2πeTH), at the horizon. Here, p= 0 for
{ab}={ty, tϕ, yy, yϕ, ϕϕ },p= 1 for {ab}={tx, xy, xϕ },
andp= 2 for {ab}={xx}.
Finally, we have to discuss the boundary conditions at
north and south poles of the S2, recalling that we are
interested in m= 1 modes. In these conditions, regularity
requires that the perturbations behave as
˜Hab
x→±1∼(1−x2)k, (A8)
which eliminates irregular modes that would diverge as
(1−x2)−k, where k= 0 for {ab}={ty, xy},k= 1 for
{ab}={tx, tϕ, xx, xϕ, yy },k= 2 for ˜Hyϕandk= 3 for
˜Hϕϕ.
The above boundary conditions (A6)-(A8) are simply
imposed if we introduce the ancillary functions qj, (j=
1,···,9) defined has

more natural dimensionless quantities χ≡J/M2=a/M,ω M

and search for the auxiliary functions qjthat are smooth
and that obey derived boundary conditions, i.e. conditions
that follow simply from the equations of motion for qj
evaluated at the boundaries, y= 0,1 and x=±1 (see
[49]). Further recall that once the 9 functions qjare found,
˜Httis given by a simply function of {˜Hyy,˜Hxx,˜Hϕϕ}.
In more detail, at the horizon it follows from the equa-
tions of motion that q1,2,3satisfy inhomogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions and q4,5,6,7,8,9obey homogeneous
Neumann boundary conditions:
q1(0, x) =1−α2

q2(0, x) =1−α2

andq4,5,6,8,9obey mixed (Robin) boundary conditions
that are long and not enlightening to show (again they
simply follow from the equations of motion at y= 1).
Finally, at the poles x=±1 of the sphere, the equationsof motion give the derived boundary conditions:

Summarizing, we have to solve a nonlinear eigenvalue
problem −e.g.eωappears inside a square root in (A11)
−to find the eigenfrequencies eωand associated eigenfunc-
tions qj(j= 1,···,9) that obey the boundary conditions
(A10)−(A12) . For that we use a Newton-Raphson root-
finding algorithm introduced and discussed in detail in
Sec. III.C of the review [ 49]. The system of PDEs is
then discretized using a pseudospectral collocation grid
on Gauss-Chebyshev-Lobbato points in the compactified
directions y∈[0,1] and x∈[−1,1] and the linear equa-
tions are solved using LU decomposition. These numerical
methods are very well tested. In particular they are the
same that were used to compute the ultraspinning and
bar-mode gravitational instabilities of rapidly spinning
Myers-Perry BHs [ 40–44,48], the near-horizon scalar con-
densation and superradiant instabilities of BHs [ 45,145],
the gravitational superradiant instability of Kerr-AdS
BHs [ 46,47] and the electro-gravitational quasinormal
modes of the Kerr-Newman BHs [ 50]. This fact further
gives confidence on the validity of the analysis and results8
of the present study.
Appendix B: Further numerical results
In Fig. 3 we present a three-dimensional plot (top pan-
els) and a contour plot (bottom panels) of the dominant
unstable dipole ( m= 1) mode discussed in the main text
with all the data we collected. The right panels display
the imaginary part of the frequency ωIMas a function
of the BH spin χand coupling α. The left panels dis-
play the difference between the angular velocity of the
horizon and the real part of the frequency, (Ω H−ωR)M.
The superradiant instability corresponds to Ω H−ωR>0
andωI>0. In Fig. 1 of the main text we have takenthe data of Fig. 3 corresponding to lines of constant
α= 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8.
We have validated our numerical method by:
•Reproducing the analytical hydrogenic spectrum in
the Newtonian ( α≪1) limit [14];
•Reproducing the numerical results for the special
dipole mode in the nonspinning limit [36];
•Verifying that all superradiant modes become
marginally stable ( ωI= 0) precisely when the su-
perradiant condition is saturated, ω= Ω H, within
the high numerical accuracy of our code. This in-
stability onset is described by the black curve in all
the plots of Fig. 3.
