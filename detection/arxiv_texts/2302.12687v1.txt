ABSTRACT
We present analysis of 63 nearby ( <44 Mpc) early-type galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters u sing the recently discovered
parameter Central Intensity Ratio (CIR /u1D43C) determined from near-infra-red (3.6 /u1D707m) observations with the Infra-red-array-camera
ofSpitzer space telescope. The CIR /u1D43C, when combined with ﬁlters involving age and /u1D435−/u1D43Ecolour of host galaxies, helps identify
two distinct classes of galaxies hosting nuclear star clust ers. This is independently veriﬁed using Gaussian Mixture M odel. CIR
shows a positive trend with faint, low mass, and blue galaxie s in the sample, while the opposite is true for bright, high ma ss,
and red galaxies, albeit with large scatter. The variation o f CIR/u1D43Cwith central velocity dispersion, absolute B band magnitud e,
dynamical mass, and stellar mass of host galaxies suggests t hat the mass of nuclear star clusters increases with that of h ost
galaxies, for faint, low mass, young and blue galaxies in the sample. In bright, high-mass, old and red galaxies, on the ot her hand,
the evolution of nuclear star clusters appears complex, wit h no apparent trends.The analysis also reveals that redder g alaxies
(/u1D435−/u1D43E >3.76) are more likely to be dominated by the central black-hole than the nuclear star clusters, while for bluer galaxies
(/u1D435−/u1D43E <3.76) in the sample the situation is quite opposite.

1 INTRODUCTION
The evolution of galaxies is closely connected with interac tions and
mergers ( Tonnesen & Cen 2012 ). The minor and major interactions
(e.g.Woods & Geller 2007 ;Robaina et al. 2009 ;Lambas et al. 2012 )
have signiﬁcant eﬀects on the star formation, morphology, k inemat-
ics, and physical conditions of gas, both in the central and o uter
regions of galaxies. Large quantities of gas can be funnelle d to the
central region of galaxies during major mergers, triggerin g enormous
star formation and rapid fuelling of central black holes ( Dutta et al.
2018). Due to these reasons, the very innermost regions of galaxi es
provide examples of extreme astrophysical environments, w here nu-
merous complex mechanisms operate simultaneously that hav e direct
as well as indirect roles in the formation and evolution of ga laxies.
The properties of nuclear regions are thought to be linked to the
formation history of galaxies where the collapse of gas and m erg-
ing of galaxies can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the creation of di ﬀerent
types of galaxies ( Gullieuszik et al. 2014 ). As a result, the very cen-
tral regions of galaxies host fascinating objects like supe rmassive
black holes (hereafter SMBHs) and active galactic nuclei (A GN)
whereas nuclei of some galaxies are undergoing extreme star forma-
tion at their centres in the form of central starbursts, and e xtreme
stellar densities ( Pechetti et al. 2020 ). All these are likely connected
to the global properties of their host galaxies, and the co-e volution of
various components is invoked to account for the observed co rrela-
tions ( Gullieuszik et al. 2014 ). For example, masses of SMBHs have
★E-mail: sruthiyatheendradas@gmail.com, cdr@uoc.ac.inbeen shown to correlate with a range of host-galaxy properti es (e.g.
Kormendy & Ho 2013 ;Graham 2016 ;Saglia et al. 2016 ;Davis et al.
2017;Aswathy & Ravikumar 2018 ;Sruthi & Ravikumar 2021 ).
Over the past two decades, high-resolution observations wi th
theHubble space telescope have revealed that, in some galaxies,
the central SMBH is surrounded by a massive, very compact, st ar
cluster composed of stars up to 108in number, commonly known
as nuclear star cluster (NSC). These massive stellar cluste rs re-
side at the photometric and dynamic centres of most intermed iate
and low luminosity galaxies of all Hubble types ( Böker et al. 2002 ;
den Brok et al. 2014 ;Georgiev & Böker 2014 ). NSCs are known to
be the densest stellar systems in the universe with millions of so-
lar masses packed within the central few parsecs of a galaxy a nd
therefore host unique stellar dynamics ( Cole & Debattista 2016 ).
These objects are identiﬁed as a clear over-density in stars above
the inwardly extrapolated light proﬁle of a galaxy within th e cen-
tral 50 pc ( Neumayer et al. 2020 ). NSCs are sited at the bottom
of the potential well ( Arca-Sedda & Capuzzo-Dolcetta 2014 ) and
contain old as well as young stellar populations (e.g. Rossa et al.
2006;Neumayer & Walcher 2012 ). NSCs and SMBHs are proposed
to be related to their host galaxies in similar ways, which ac tivated
a new wave of interest in the study of NSCs and their role in the
growth of SMBH (e.g. Rossa et al. 2006 ;Wehner & Harris 2006 ;
Ferrarese et al. 2006 ). Galaxies and NSCs display a variety of scaling
relations suggesting that, their formation is intricately linked to that of
their host galaxy (e.g. Georgiev & Böker 2014 ;Georgiev et al. 2016 ).
However, unlike SMBHs, the formation history of NSCs is dire ctly
visible through their stellar populations which allows for detailed
studies of the mass accretion history that takes place in gal actic nuclei

(Kacharov et al. 2018 ). Though NSCs are observed in galaxies with
every type of the Hubble sequence, their modes of formation a nd evo-
lution are still under debate ( Arca-Sedda & Capuzzo-Dolcetta 2014 ).
Two diﬀerent mechanisms are proposed for the formation of NS Cs,
infall of star clusters that formed elsewhere in the host gal axy (e.g.
Tremaine et al. 1975 ;Capuzzo-Dolcetta & Miocchi 2008 ;Antonini
2013) and in situ formation and build-up through star formation fol-
lowing the accretion of gas in the centre of galaxies ( Bekki 2007 ).
There is a need to accurately determine scaling relations in volving
NSCs to improve our understanding of the possible evolution of
NSCs with their host-galaxies ( Pechetti et al. 2020 ). Studying how
NSCs form and how they are related to the growth of central mas sive
black holes and their host galaxies is crucial for our unders tanding
of the evolution of galaxies and the physics that have shaped their
central components ( Antonini et al. 2015 ).
NSCs and SMBHs are sometimes jointly referred to
as central massive objects (CMO; Ferrarese et al. 2006 ;
Arca-Sedda & Capuzzo-Dolcetta 2014 ) whose presence is connected
to the host galaxy mass; galaxies with mass above 1010M⊙usually
host SMBH while lighter galaxies have a well resolved nuclea r star
cluster. Moreover, a transition region exists for galaxies with a mass
between 108M⊙and 1010M⊙where both the objects co-exist.
It seems that there is a continuous sequence from NSC-domina ted
galaxies to SMBH-dominated galaxies as the galaxies grow bi gger
(Arca-Sedda et al. 2016 ). The formation of NSCs may also be con-
nected to the formation of SMBH in the centre, and these objec ts
could therefore trace the evolutionary history of the host g alaxy for-
mation. For instance, NSCs sit on the low mass extrapolation of
the scaling relation between the SMBH mass and the total mass of
the host galaxy ( Gullieuszik et al. 2014 ). However, interactions with
SMBHs have the potential to destroy NSCs or inhibit NSC growt h in
most massive galaxies ( Fahrion et al. 2021 ). Very few NSCs are ob-
served in galaxies harbouring very massive SMBHs at their ce ntres;
this could be an indication of a physical connection between the pres-
ence (or absence) of NSCs and SMBHs in galaxies ( Arca-Sedda et al.
2016). The relationship between NSCs and SMBHs is not well un-
derstood as the size of a sample of galaxies with both NSC and
a central BH is quite limited ( Nguyen et al. 2018 ). Galaxies with
masses lower than 1010M⊙show clear evidence for nucleation, but
little evidence for an SMBH. Contrarily, galaxies with mass es above
∼1011M⊙are dominated by SMBH but show no evidence for nucle-
ation ( Antonini et al. 2015 ). Therefore, it is an open question whether
NSCs are an essential ingredient in (or an intermediate step towards)
the formation of a supermassive black hole in the galaxy nucl eus
(Georgiev & Böker 2014 ).
The co-evolution of nuclear star clusters and central black holes is
presently a very active ﬁeld of research. In this scenario, w e explore
the connection between NSCs, SMBHs and host galaxy properti es
with the aid of central intensity ratio (CIR; Aswathy & Ravikumar
2018,2020;Sruthi & Ravikumar 2021 ). The central intensity ratio
(deﬁned in section 2.1) is a photometric parameter that measures the
variation of light intensity at the very centre of the (proje cted) galaxy
image. Simple Monte Carlo simulations involving CIR show re mark-
able stability against variations in distance and orientat ion of ellip-
soidal systems in the nearby universe ( Aswathy & Ravikumar 2018 ,
2020). The straightforward photometric deﬁnition of CIR makes i t
sensitive to any addition (or subtraction) to the light near the centre
of a galaxy. The addition of light is possible in systems with high
star formation near the centre while quenching via feedback from the
central black hole can reduce the CIR value ( Sruthi & Ravikumar
2021). The various correlations shown by CIR in ﬁeld early-type
galaxies (hereafter ETGs) ( Sruthi & Ravikumar 2021 ) explored theco-evolution scenario in galaxies. The CIR is also found to c ontain
information about the star formation near the central regio n of galax-
ies (Aswathy & Ravikumar 2020 ). Therefore, the CIR can be used
as an ideal tool in studying galaxies hosting NSCs.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2describes the sam-
ple selection, observations, data reduction, and calculat ion of CIR/u1D43C.
Section 3presents variations of CIR /u1D43Cwith diﬀerent host galaxy prop-
erties. We present a discussion of results and conclusion in Section
4.
2 THE DATA
We constructed a sample of 80 nearby early-type galaxies hos ting
nuclear star clusters based on the availability of Spitzer /IRAC 3.6/u1D707m
observations adopted from literature. We avoided 15 galaxi es from
the above sample due to their relatively small size which cou ld aﬀect
the determination of CIR /u1D43C. Also, we avoided two galaxies NGC 205
and M32 as they are pretty close and tidally inﬂuenced by the n earby
galaxy M31. Thus the sample includes 63 nearby ETGs hosting N SCs
composed of 26 ellipticals and 37 lenticulars. The sample al ong with
the references is listed in Table 1.
2.1 Central intensity ratio
Central intensity ratio (CIR; Aswathy & Ravikumar 2018 ) is deﬁned
as,
/u1D436/u1D43C/u1D445=/u1D43C1
/u1D43C2−/u1D43C1=100.4(/u1D45A2−/u1D45A1)
1−100.4(/u1D45A2−/u1D45A1)(1)
where I1andI2are the intensities and m1andm2are the corre-
sponding magnitudes within the inner and outer apertures re spec-
tively. Aperture photometry (MAG_APER) using Source extra ctor
(SEXTRACTOR, Bertin & Arnouts 1996 ) was carried out at the
photometric centre of the galaxy image. CIR measured in the o p-
tical band (hereafter CIR /u1D449) used the inner and outer apertures of
1.5 and 3 arcsec respectively. For the present study, we have chosen
the inner and outer radii as 12 and 24 arcsec, respectively fo r the
calculation of CIR /u1D43C. The inner radius is selected to contain the ef-
fects of the point spread function (PSF) in the Spitzer images and the
outer radius is chosen to be smaller than the half-light radi i of the
sample galaxies. This ensures that the estimation of CIR is r eason-
ably stable against diﬀerences in size and surface brightne ss proﬁle
(Aswathy & Ravikumar 2018 ) of and distance to galaxies. However,
a direct comparison of CIR /u1D449and CIR/u1D43Cis not possible as there are
large diﬀerences in the PSF, depth and aperture sizes used.
The simple deﬁnition of CIR helps avoid any dependence on a
form following central intensity, I(0) (i.e. surface brightness at a
radial distance r, I(r) = I(0)f(r) where f(r) is a function of r). On
the other hand, the deﬁnition boosts any addition to (or subt raction
from) the central intensity I(0) (Aswathy & Ravikumar 2018 ,2020;
Sruthi & Ravikumar 2021 ). NSCs are very tiny objects near the cen-
tre covering around 10 parsecs only. CIR measures the total p rojected
light along the centre and hence the smaller the apertures th e better
for identifying variations in ﬂux due to NSCs.

Sruthi & Ravikumar 2021 ). These studies suggest the use of CIR as
a tool to explore the co-evolution between various structur al and dy-
namical properties of diﬀerent Hubble types of galaxies. Th is paper
discusses the variation of CIR /u1D43Cwith diﬀerent host galaxy properties
for a sample of 63 nearby ETGs hosting NSCs.
3.1 Variation of CIR /u1D43Cwith central velocity dispersion
In Fig. 1, variation of CIR /u1D43Cwith central velocity dispersion is shown.
Central stellar velocity dispersion is a tracer of galaxy ma ss validated
by various studies (e.g. Auger et al. 2010 ). It is well known that, the
luminosity as well as Mg 2index of a galaxy tightly correlates with
velocity dispersion (e.g. Faber & Jackson 1976 ;Colless et al. 1999 ).
Likewise, a tight correlation exists between the masses of s upermas-
sive black holes and the velocity dispersions of the bulges t hat host
them ( Gebhardt et al. 2000 ). It is also reported to exhibit a signiﬁ-
cantly strong correlation with the total gravitating mass o f a galaxy
making it a very fundamental parameter in galaxy evolution s tudies
(Bogdán & Goulding 2015 ). Even though no apparent connection
between CIR and velocity dispersion is seen, there appears t he possi-
bility of at least two populations showing diﬀerent trends. This is not
completely surprising. Owing to the simple deﬁnition of CIR , higher
will be its value when the (projected) intensity in the inner aperture is
increased (by virtue of, say, increased star formation near the centre)
or when light contribution in the outer shell ( /u1D45F2-/u1D45F1) is decreased
(as can happen when obscured by dust). Hence it’s quite natur al to
expect the CIR to be less eﬀective when a sample contains sets with
diﬀerent characteristics that can aﬀect the value of CIR diﬀ erently.
In order to explore this, in Fig. 1(a), we split the sample into blue
and red ones using the median /u1D435−/u1D43Ecolour (3.76) of the sample
galaxies. The median value was used for minimising uncertai nties
associated with the low number statistics in a group. /u1D435−/u1D43Ecolour
is a good indicator of the amount of dust extinction ( Peletier et al.
1995). Galaxies bluer than the median /u1D435−/u1D43Ecolour (3.76), hereafter
blue galaxies, are represented as blue ﬁlled circles and tho se red-
der than the median, hereafter red galaxies, are shown as red ﬁlled
circles. Blue galaxies show a mild positive trend (linear co rrelation
coeﬃcient,/u1D45F=0.64 with a signiﬁcance, /u1D446=99.95 per cent, see
Table 2) in the plot suggesting an increase in galaxy mass as CIR /u1D43C
increases while red galaxies in our sample do not show any app arent
association. The nature of clustering in the sample is indep endently
veriﬁed using Gaussian Mixture Model analysis (GMM; Bovy et al.
2011;Wagenveld et al. 2022 ). A basic assumption of GMM is that
all the data points are drawn from a mixture of a ﬁnite number o f
Gaussian components with unknown distribution parameters (Gao2018). The GMM can assign a membership score (posterior prob-
ability) to each data point that describes how similar each p oint is
to each cluster’s centre; which is an automated process and d oes not
require manual intervention. GMM is being used in various ﬁe lds,
including astrophysics ( Chattopadhyay & Maitra 2017 ;Kaplan et al.
2018), as an unsupervised clustering technique. The representa tion
of regularly distributed subpopulations within a populati on can be
done probabilistically using GMM. This statistical model u ses an
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm ( Dempster et al. 1977 )
to optimize the model’s likelihood. In Fig. 1(e) the diﬀerent groups
identiﬁed by GMM are given in green and purple ﬁlled circles. The
result of GMM also suggests the presence of two groups within the
sample which are statistically diﬀerent.
In Fig. 1(b), we use age as a parameter to explore the pos-
sible subsets. Here SSP age reported in literature ( Chilingarian
2009;Amblard et al. 2014 ;Dabringhausen & Fellhauer 2016 ) is
used. Galaxies with an age less than 10 Gyr (hereafter young g alaxies)
are denoted as blue ﬁlled circles and those with an age more th an 10
Gyr (hereafter old galaxies) are represented as red ﬁlled ci rcles. Here
young galaxies follow a positive trend ( /u1D45F=0.79,/u1D446 >99.99 per cent),
while the old ones appear to possess a negative trend ( /u1D45F=−0.77,
/u1D446=99.45 per cent) though not reliable due to the limited number of
galaxies. Here also the GMM analysis identiﬁes clusters sim ilar to
the ones we constructed using age (Fig. 1(f)).
Next, we explore the inﬂuence of environment of galaxies. In
order to do that a galaxy is considered in the rare environmen t if it
possesses a surrounding galaxy density below 36 Mpc−3within 0.5
Mpc in the plane of the sky and if no nearest neighbour falls wi thin
250 km s−1in recession velocity, otherwise it is treated from dense
environment1. In Fig. 1(c), galaxies from the dense environment
(hereafter DE) are given as blue ﬁlled circles whereas those from
the rare environment (hereafter RE) are shown as red ﬁlled ci rcles.
No apparent trends are visible here. However, the statistic al clusters
identiﬁed by GMM, shown in Fig. 1(g), are not comparable here
suggesting the environment of a galaxy does not appear to be a good
diﬀerentiator in this sample.
Application of both age and colour criteria together, howev er,
reveals the presence of two distinct sets of galaxies presen t in the
sample and is shown in Fig. 1(d). It is evident from the Figure that,
young and dusty systems seem to follow a positive trend ( /u1D45F=0.73,
/u1D446=99.94 per cent). On the other hand, old and less dusty systems
tend to follow a near-perfect negative correlation ( /u1D45F=−0.86,/u1D446=

99.73 per cent). As shown in Fig. 1(h), the application of GMM also
reveals two statistical sets of galaxies. The central veloc ity dispersion
of galaxies enjoys a very strong and positive correlation wi th the mass
of central SMBH. The mass of SMBH of most of our sample galaxie s
is estimated using their /u1D70Evalues. Hence all the correlations/trends
with/u1D70Ementioned here can stand as a proxy to those involving the
mass of SMBH as well.
3.2 Variation of CIR /u1D43Cwith M/u1D435
Variation of absolute B band magnitude with CIR /u1D43Cis shown in Fig.
2(a). Galaxies bluer than the median /u1D435−/u1D43Ecolour are denoted with
blue ﬁlled circles whereas the redder galaxies are represen ted using
red ﬁlled circles. Blue galaxies in the sample show a mild pos i-
tive trend (/u1D45F=−0.65,/u1D446=99.98 per cent) whereas red galaxies
show a weak negative trend ( /u1D45F=0.68,/u1D446=99.97 per cent). Opti-
cal B band is particularly sensitive to star-forming compon ents in
low redshift galaxies ( Jahnke & Wisotzki 2003 ). Most of the blue
galaxies are faint (with M /u1D435<−19), while red galaxies are aligned
with bright galaxies in the sample. As the blue (and faint) ga laxies
may contain more dust (in the central region) than their red c ounter-
parts, an increased infra-red emission from their centres i s possible
(da Cunha et al. 2010 ) which can rise their CIR /u1D43Cvalue. On the other
hand, a black hole’s ability to remove dust from its sphere of inﬂu-
ence ( Ricci et al. 2017 ) and associated quenching may be the primary
physical driver of the negative trend shown by red galaxies. A very
similar clustering is obtained using GMM and is shown in Fig. 2(b)
where the green ﬁlled circles represent the galaxies in GMM c lus-
ter 1, while the purple ﬁlled circles represent the galaxies in GMM

on velocity dispersion and size of the galaxy ( Auger et al. 2010 ).

Scott & Graham (2013) orDabringhausen & Fellhauer (2016). How-
ever, they have used diﬀerent methods to estimate it. Scott & Graham
(2013) used virial estimator M /u1D451/u1D466/u1D45B=/u1D6FC/u1D70E2/u1D452R/u1D452/G, where R /u1D452is the eﬀec-
tive half-light radius and /u1D70E/u1D452, is the luminosity-weighted velocity dis-
persion measured within a 1R /u1D452aperture. Dabringhausen & Fellhauer
(2016) calculated M /u1D451/u1D466/u1D45Busing the following equation;
/u1D440/u1D451/u1D466/u1D45B=/u1D43E/u1D449
/u1D43A/u1D445/u1D452/u1D70E2
0, (2)where K/u1D449is a factor that depends on the shape of the density proﬁle
of the ETG, Gis the gravitational constant, R/u1D452is the eﬀective radius
of the galaxy and /u1D70E0is the velocity dispersion at the centre of the
galaxy. The variation of M /u1D451/u1D466/u1D45Bis plotted against CIR /u1D43Cin Fig. 2(c)
and clusters identiﬁed using GMM are shown in Fig. 2(d). Albeit
the heterogeneity in the method of determination of M /u1D451/u1D466/u1D45B, here also
we can observe that the blue galaxies show a weak positive tre nd
(/u1D45F=0.63,/u1D446=99.91 per cent) with CIR /u1D43C. For the red systems in
MNRAS 000,1–9(2023)Study of central intensity ratio 7
the plot, no trend is visible. Dust content in galaxies is rep orted to
possess good correlations with stellar mass ( Santini et al. 2014 ) and
star formation rate ( da Cunha et al. 2010 ;Santini et al. 2014 ). In a
galaxy with a high dust content, the star formation rate can i ncrease,
causing the CIR /u1D43Cto increase with its dynamical mass.
3.4 Variation of CIR /u1D43Cwith M/u1D460/u1D461/u1D45F
Stellar mass of the sample galaxies, M /u1D460/u1D461/u1D45F, were compiled
from Scott & Graham (2013),Neumayer et al. (2020),Pechetti et al.
(2020) and Fahrion et al. (2021).Pechetti et al. (2020) used Spitzer
3.6/u1D707m luminosities and a mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of 0.5 at 3.6 /u1D707m to
estimate the galaxy stellar masses. Scott & Graham (2013) obtained
stellar mass from the total galaxy luminosity in /u1D43Eband, M/u1D43E(us-
ing 2MASS observations), assuming a standard mass-to-ligh t ratio,
M/L/u1D43E= 0.8 (e.g. Balcells et al. 2007 ;Bell & de Jong 2001 ). Fig.
2(e) shows the variation of M /u1D460/u1D461/u1D45Fwith CIR/u1D43Cand Fig. 2(f) shows the
same using GMM clustering. Here also the blue galaxies show a
systematic increase in CIR /u1D43Cwith increasing stellar mass ( /u1D45F=0.64,
/u1D446=99.98 per cent) which is not completely surprising as dusty
galaxies can harbour high star formation (e.g. Cortese et al. 2012 ;
Bourne et al. 2012 ). For the red systems in the plot, however, no
apparent association can be found.
3.5 Variation of CIR /u1D43Cwith M/u1D45B/u1D460/u1D450
The variation of CIR /u1D43Cwith M/u1D45B/u1D460/u1D450is shown in Fig. 2(g). Blue galaxies
show a slight positive trend ( /u1D45F=0.71,/u1D446=99.99 per cent) whereas
red galaxies seem to be scattered. The statistical cluster a ssociation
obtained using GMM, shown in Fig. 2(h), does not show any simi-
larity with that obtained using /u1D435−/u1D43Ecolour. The masses of NSCs
obey correlations with properties of the host galaxies such as ve-
locity dispersion and bulge mass ( Ferrarese et al. 2006 ). Early-type
galaxies exhibit a low contrast between NSC and host-galaxy body
making the spectroscopic studies of NSCs in ETGs extremely d iﬃ-
cult ( Böker 2008 ). Most of the existing mass estimates of NSCs are
photometric, based generally on SED ﬁtting or colour-mass- to-light
ratios of galaxies. These may not be the best indicators of ma ss due to
age-metallicity degeneracy and because NSCs contain compl ex star
formation history ( Pechetti et al. 2020 ). Despite these, CIR /u1D43Cseems to
vary with M /u1D45B/u1D460/u1D450for dusty systems in the sample. The CIR /u1D43C, estimated
using Spitzer space telescope, appears to trace many properties of
galaxies for dusty systems in the sample.
4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this paper, we determine the central intensity ratio of ea rly-type
galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters using near-infrare d light and
present its variations with diﬀerent host galaxy propertie s such as
central velocity dispersion ( /u1D70E), absolute B band magnitude (M /u1D435),
dynamical mass (M /u1D451/u1D466/u1D45B), stellar mass (M /u1D460/u1D461/u1D45F) and mass of nuclear star
cluster (M/u1D45B/u1D460/u1D450) of the host galaxy and reﬂect the possible connection
between the evolution of galaxies and their central light di stribution.
The values of CIR measured from nearby bands are known not to
disturb correlations or trends, involving CIR ( Sruthi & Ravikumar
2021). However, CIR measured from diﬀerent broadbands can vary
diﬀerently. In the optical band, the dust present in the (pro jected)
central region of galaxies can limit the light visible to obs ervers.
On the other hand, in near-infrared, one gets dust-penetrat ed light
from the centres of galaxies which may originate from small d ust
grains that are heated by energetic photons produced by youn g stars(Magdis et al. 2013 ). Dusty galaxies in the sample where CIR /u1D43Cshows
a positive trend with M /u1D45B/u1D460/u1D450, thus suggesting a mutual growth of NSCs
with CIR/u1D43C. It is likely that NSCs are part of star formation near the
centre in low-mass galaxies. The growth of NSCs in the center s of
these galaxies may add light to their centers. However, high -mass
galaxies in the sample do not show such a trend. Variation of M /u1D45B/u1D460/u1D450
with the host galaxy parameters such as central velocity dis persion,
absolute B band magnitude, dynamical mass, and stellar mass of
the sample galaxies seem to be scattered. Moreover, CIR /u1D43Cshows a
positive trend with all the above-mentioned parameters for low mass,
blue, young, and faint galaxies in the sample. However, in hi gh-mass
galaxies in the sample the increased mass of SMBH might have
reduced the NSC domination in the centre, resulting in the la ck of
any correlation with CIR /u1D43C.
CIR/u1D43Cis showing a positive trend with /u1D70Efor young and dusty
galaxies in the sample suggesting an increase in dust and lig ht content
corresponding to the emission of 3.6 /u1D707m band as the galaxy grows,
while their older counterparts show no signiﬁcant trend. En vironment
seems insigniﬁcant in the CIR /u1D43C-/u1D70Eplot though/u1D70Eis coupled with
the local galaxy density ( Spindler & Wake 2017 ). Dust abundance is
directly connected with galaxy growth through the formatio n of new
stars ( Santini et al. 2014 ). Thus, it is possible to attribute the growth
in central velocity dispersion to that in galaxy mass.
An increase in /u1D70Ealso indicates the possibility of growth in
the size of the galaxy’s central black hole, its central pote ntial,
and its total mass validated by various studies (e.g. Auger et al.
2010;Gebhardt et al. 2000 ).Aswathy & Ravikumar (2018), here-
after AR18, reported that CIR calculated in the optical band (CIR/u1D449)
shows a strong negative correlation with the mass of the supe rmas-
sive black hole and central velocity dispersion for classic al bulges,
whereas that of spirals and lenticulars with pseudo-bulges remained
outliers. 8 ellipticals and 6 lenticulars in AR18 are presen t in our
sample also. The pseudo-bulges, which behaved as outliers i n AR18,
seem to obey a positive trend here along with the blue galaxie s
whereas classical bulges in their correlation seem to be a pa rt of
the red galaxies in our sample. Sruthi & Ravikumar (2021) found
that, CIR/u1D449follows negative correlations with M /u1D435/u1D43Band/u1D70Efor ﬁeld
ETGs also. These studies discussed the possible quenching t hat hap-
pened in these systems as the black hole grows. In our sample,
CIR/u1D449does not show any signiﬁcant correlation with M /u1D435/u1D43Bor/u1D70E.
From Fig. 1(a), it is evident that the majority of our sample galax-
ies are carrying dust in them. The presence of dust can distur b the
relation in the optical band. The correlations/trends desc ribed by
CIR are context-dependent. In the studies of Aswathy & Ravikumar
(2018) and Sruthi & Ravikumar (2021), the correlations involving
CIR/u1D449were possible as most of their sample galaxies contained low
amounts of dust. In the current study, on the contrary, most o f the
NSC host galaxies are reported to contain high amounts of dus t, mak-
ing observations in the near-infra-red band well suited to s tudy their
central light distribution. Interstellar dust in galaxies absorbs energy
from starlight; this absorbed energy is then re-radiated at infra-red
and far-infra-red wavelengths ( Draine & Li 2007 ). The contribution
of thermal dust to the observed emission at 3.6 /u1D707/u1D45Acan be powered
by AGN and/or star formation ( Sani et al. 2011 ).Graham & Spitler
(2009) discuss two possible ways of BH growth in galaxies hosting
NSCs, (i) some massive BHs may grow through runaway collisio n
of NSC stars, (ii) inward gas ﬂow may result in star formation at
the galactic centre, that itself may be fuelling the growth o f BHs. It
is likely that the same gas that is feeding star formation als o feeds
the black hole ( Hopkins & Quataert 2010 ). In that sense, the pres-
ence of an NSC may, in fact, enhance the growth rate of the cent ral
black hole ( Neumayer et al. 2020 ). Nuclear star formation is more

solidly coupled to the growth of central black holes than the global
star formation rate ( Hopkins & Quataert 2010 ). Dusty galaxies in our
sample reveal that their central light distribution is coup led to NSC
growth. If NSC growth can boost central BH growth, it is natur al
to assume that there may be a growth in the central potential a lso.
Thus our analysis supports the co-evolution of NSCs with the ir host
galaxies reported in the literature, at least for dusty gala xies.
Ferrarese et al. (2006) reported that, in low-mass galaxies (Galaxy
mass < 1010M⊙), which may not have supermassive black holes
(searches are ongoing for low-mass central BHs ( ≤106M⊙), the
masses of nuclear star clusters correlated with the one-dim ensional
velocity dispersion ( /u1D70E/u1D44F/u1D462/u1D459/u1D454/u1D452 ). However, the connection between
NSCs and central BHs is not well understood. The sample of gal ax-
ies with both a detected NSC and a BH is quite limited. Even fro m
this data, it is clear that, low-mass (109- 1010M⊙) galactic nuclei
are dominated by NSCs while high-mass (Galaxy mass > 1010M⊙)
galaxy nuclei are dominated by SMBHs ( Nguyen et al. 2018 ). In-
creasing evidence also points out that, massive star cluste rs are sites
of inter-mediate mass black hole formation ( Seth et al. 2006 ). But
direct observational pieces of evidence for such BHs are les s since
such small BHs are extremely diﬃcult targets for dynamical s earches
(Neumayer & Walcher 2012 ). Nuclear star clusters are common in
those spheroids with stellar mass M /u1D460/u1D461/u1D45F∼108−11M⊙harbouring a
M/u1D435/u1D43B< 107M⊙and may contribute signiﬁcantly to the mass of cen-
tral blackhole. A larger value of M /u1D435/u1D43Bcan prevent the co-existence
with NSC because the very central stars should be either disr upted by
the BH gravity or kicked away by tidal forces ( Sani et al. 2011 ). These
interactions with NSCs and BHs possibly explain the negligi ble nu-cleation fraction for galaxies with M /u1D460/u1D461/u1D45F> 1011M⊙(Fahrion et al.
2021). The reason for massive galaxies showing deviation from th e
positive trend exhibited in CIR /u1D43C-/u1D70Eplot can be explained using
the above-proposed interactions. Neumayer & Walcher (2012) dis-
cuss two possible scenarios that can happen in high mass gala xies,
(i) either the galaxies with massive BHs never had a sizeable NSC,
possibly because their central BHs grew early in the age of th e uni-
verse; thus stopping NSC growth, or, (ii) massive BHs destro y their
host NSCs. The positive CIR /u1D43C-/u1D70Etrend in Fig. 1possibly suggests the
simultaneous growth of NSC and BH. However, we can not make a
strong statement on red galaxies in the sample as no such tren ds are
visible in CIR /u1D43C-/u1D70Evariation.
A positive correlation is reported between M /u1D460/u1D461/u1D45Fand log
(M/u1D435/u1D43B/M/u1D45B/u1D460/u1D450) for a sample of galaxies hosting NSC ( Neumayer et al.
2020). They applied very strict conditions to construct their li mited
sample, such as dynamically estimated masses for BHs and NSC s.
However, no such correlation is observed for this study, as c an be
seen in Fig. 3, where we used all early-type galaxies hosting NSCs.
In the ﬁgure, a comparison of /u1D435−/u1D43Eclustering and GMM clustering
is given. In panel a, blue galaxies are shown in blue ﬁlled circles
whereas red galaxies are denoted as red ﬁlled circles. In pan elb,
galaxies in GMM cluster 1 are denoted by green ﬁlled circles, and
galaxies in GMM cluster 2 are represented by purple ﬁlled cir cles.
The dashed line represents the equal mass NSCs and BHs in gala x-
ies. Galaxies above the dashed line host more massive BHs tha n
NSCs while galaxies below the dashed line host BHs less massi ve
than NSCs. It can be seen that in the red galaxies in the sample , the
central region is dominated by the (central) blackhole, whe re as it
is the nuclear star cluster that dominates the centre of blue galaxies.
The GMM clustering also reproduces the result.
Using simple photometric techniques, we analyzed centers o f
nearby ETGs hosting NSCs. In these galaxies, NSCs appear to b e
involved in central star formation. Improved mass determin ations of
NSCs in the future may allow us to study galaxies hosting NSCs
using CIR/u1D43C. CIR/u1D43Ccan be used as a proxy to measure central velocity
dispersion in dusty galaxies where AGN/heavy star formatio n pre-
vents its measurement. In this context, analysis involving the simple
photometric quantity CIR seems promising to shed more light on the
galaxy evolution scenarios.
