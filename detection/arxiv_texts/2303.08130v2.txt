Recently, the inner main belt asteroid (152830) Dinkinesh was identiﬁed as an additional ﬂy-
by target for the Lucymission. The heliocentric orbit and approximate absolute magnitude of
Dinkinesh are known, but little additional information was available prior to its selection as
a target. In particular, the lack of color spectrophotometry or spectra made it impossible to
assign a spectral type to Dinkinesh from which its albedo could be estimated. We set out to
remedy this knowledge gap by obtaining visible wavelength spectra with the Keck telescope
on 2022 November 23 and with Gemini-South on 2022 December 27. The spectra measured
with the Keck I/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) and the Gemini South/Gemini

Using this albedo range for Dinkinesh in combination with measured absolute magnitude, it is
possible to derive an eﬀective diameter and surface brightness for this body. The albedo, size
and surface brightness are important inputs required for planning a successful encounter by the
Lucyspacecraft.
1. Introduction
The Lucymission will be the ﬁrst spacecraft mission to encounter members of the Jupiter Trojan asteroid
population,ﬂyingbyatotalofeightTrojanobjectsfrom2027through2033(Levisonetal.,2021;Olkinetal.,2021).

A search of smaller asteroids that would come close to Lucy’s trajectory recently identiﬁed one with an exceptionally
close encounter in November 2023 (R. Marschall, private communication). (152830) 1999 VD57, recently named
Dinkinesh (Tichá et al., 2023), orbits in the inner main belt with a semi-major axis of a= 2.19 AU, eccentricity, e
= 0.11 and inclination i= 2.09 degrees1. With the addition of a small maneuver, Lucywill be redirected to a ù450
km distant ﬂyby encounter with Dinkinesh on 01 November 20232, making it the ﬁrst of ten asteroid targets that the
spacecraft will visit.
A target’s diameter is needed to plan an encounter with the Lucyspacecraft. In order to determine an eﬀective
diameter Defffromthemeasuredabsolutemagnitudeoftheasteroid, H,itisnecessarytoestimatethevisualgeometric
albedo. Deffis proportional to pv*1_2and the size in km is given by Deff= 1329 pv*1_210*H_5(Harris & Lagerros,
2002). With no additional constraints, the possible albedo, pv, for an asteroid in the main belt spans a wide range,

the terminal tracking system’s threshold later in the sequence with less time to lock onto the target. The albedo may
also impact observations of the resolved surface by rendering the target either too bright or too faint for the dynamic
range of the instruments for a given exposure time.
Asteroid diameters are often derived through a combination of visible reﬂectance and thermal infrared emission
(Delbo et al., 2015). More direct methods include radar observations (Benner et al., 2015) or in-situspacecraft
observations (e.g., Lauretta et al., 2017). Polarimetry of asteroids taken at varying phase angles can also be used
to infer albedos and diameters (Belskaya et al., 2015). For the case of Dinkinesh, there are, unfortunately, no existing
datathatcanbeusedtoconstrainitsdiameter.Itremainspossible,however,touseanindirectmethodforconstraining

2. Observations
We obtained two separate spectra, one from the Keck telescope and one from Gemini-South. We used the Low

CCD arrays and the red camera consists of two science grade Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 2k 4k CCD
arrays. Both cameras have a spatial resolution of 0.135 arcsec pixel*1. The 1.0-arcsecond wide slit was used with the

and the 400/8500 grating for the red camera providing a spectral resolution of 0.4 nm and 0.7 nm, respectively (Oke
et al., 1995; McCarthy et al., 1998). One 1200 s exposure and two 900 s exposures were taken of Dinkinesh for a
total integration time of 3000 s. The exposures were taken in seeing conditions of ù0.7¨¨measured at zenith and the
observations were taken at an airmass of ù1.05. Wavelength calibration used HgCdZn lamps for the blue camera and
theArNeXelampsfortheredcamera.FluxcalibrationusedthestandardstarBD+284211fortheblueandredcamera,
and a solar analog star, 2MASS HD53991, was used for slope correction. The spectra were reduced using the LPipe
software for reducing LRIS data (Perley, 2019).
On 2022 December 27, an additional spectrum of Dinkinesh was obtained using the Gemini-South Multi-Object
Spectrograph (GMOS-S) on the Gemini South 8.1 m telescope was used to observe Dinkinesh under program GS-
2022B-FT-110 (PI: K. Noll). The GMOS-S detector array consists of three 2048 4176 Hamamatsu chips separated

R150gratingandtheGG455_G0329order-blockingﬁlterprovidingaspectralresolutionof1.2nm(Hooketal.,2004).
Three 900 s exposures of Dinkinesh were taken for a total integration time of 2700 s and were taken in ù0.7¨¨seeing
measured at zenith. Due to the +27ýdeclination of Dinkinesh on 2022 December 27 and the ù-30ýlatitude of the
Gemini S site, the asteroid had to be observed when at the low elevation of ù33ýwhen it could be observed at a
minimum airmass of ù1.8 at ù5:04 UTC on 2022 December 27. Observations of Dinkinesh closer to zenith could

telluric skylines in the spectra. The ﬂux calibration used the spectroscopic standard star LTT3864, and a solar analog
star, HD 43965, was used for slope correction. A combination of the DRAGONS Gemini reduction software (Labrie
et al., 2019) and custom software was used to reduce the GMOS-S spectra. A technical defect in the ampliﬁer of the
GMOS-S instrument aﬀected the extraction of spectra between 0.69-0.81 micron, so the data from this wavelength
range were removed from the ﬁnal spectrum.

To assign a taxonomic class for Dinkinesh , we compare the spectra of Dinkinesh with the mean Bus-DeMean
asteroid spectrum database (DeMeo et al., 2009). Visual inspection quickly identiﬁes the Dinkinesh spectrum as best

0.7-0.8 micron in the GMOS-S spectrum, we place a higher signiﬁcance on the ﬁt to the LRIS data. C-, V-, and Q-
types, three types with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent albedos that are present in the inner main belt, are more than an order
of magnitude worse ﬁts and can be conﬁdently ruled out. We conclude that Dinkinesh is a typical S- or Sq-type inner
main belt asteroid. The spectral range of V, S, Sq and C-type asteroids from (DeMeo & Carry, 2013) are plotted in

And because the S-, Sq-, and Q- types have similar albedos (Binzel et al., 2004), an exact classiﬁcation along this
spectrum of similar objects is not necessary for our purposes. As a ﬁnal caveat, we note that using visible spectral
information alone for taxonomic classiﬁcation is less precise than would result from the addition of near-infrared
data as well (DeMeo et al., 2009), although in the present case, we believe there is little chance of consequential
misidentiﬁcation.

most-likely outcome.
Constraints on other asteroid spectral types that constitute lower-probability candidates (and worse spectral ﬁts)

are predominantly located in the Hungaria region of the main belt located at aù2 au andiù20-25ý, well separated
from the location of Dinkinesh with aù2.2 au andiù2ýweakening Xe/E-types as a possible match for Dinkinesh
(DeMeo & Carry, 2013; Lucas et al., 2017). A hypothetical K-type match for Dinkinesh is contradicted by the fact
thatK-typesaremostlyfoundintheEosoutermainbeltasteroidfamily(Brož&Morbidelli,2013)conﬁnedtothe7:3
mean motion resonance with Jupiter at 2.957 au (Hanuš et al., 2018). Thus, based on both the orbital distribution and
spectral ﬁt, the identiﬁcation of Dinkinesh as an S- or Sq-type asteroid is strongly supported.
With the identiﬁcation of Dinkinesh as an S- or Sq-type asteroid, we turn to using that information to assign a
probablealbedo.Todothiswemustmaketheassumptionthatthemeasuredalbedosofasteroidswithagivenspectral

contributing to the size uncertainty, such as lightcure variabilitity, are likely comparable to or larger than that arising
from the estimated albedo. The illuminated area on approach by the Lucyspacecraft will depend on many factors

WhileitispossiblethatthediﬀerencesinthespectraobtainedwithLRISandGMOS-Sareartifactsofinstrumental
diﬀerences or the higher airmass at which the GMOS-S observations were obtained, which can have an eﬀect on
asteroid spectra (Reddy et al., 2015), we believe it is worth considering the possibility that this measured diﬀerence
reﬂects a real variation in Dinkinesh . As noted above, the band depth of the 0.9-1 micron feature is related to the
accumulation and removal of weathered material. In a non-spherical object, it is possible that the small impacts
responsible for removing weathered regolith can result in uneven distributions of such material. Areas at low
geopotential height might accumulate or retain more weathered surface materials than other locations on the body.
Thus, it is possible that the spectrum could change as a function of the rotational phase as seen from the Earth. The
Lucyspacecraft could test this possibility with visible spectrophotometry and near-infrared spectra obtained over the
course of the asteroid’s rotation.

Figure 1: Visible spectra of Dinkinesh taken with Keck/LRIS and Gemini S/GMOS-S. The spectrum of Dinkinesh taken
with Keck/LRIS on 2022 November 23 is plotted in blue for the portion covered by the blue camera and plotted in red for
the portion covered by the red camera. The LRIS spectrum was obtained by combining two spectra from the blue and red
camera separated by a dichroic at 0.56 micron. The bump at ù0.56 micron is an artifact caused by the dichroic and the
gaps at í0.72, í0.80 and í0.87 micron are artifacts and the imperfect removal of telluric features. The Gemini S/GMOS-S
spectrum of Dinkinesh obtained on 2022 Dec 27 is plotted in black. The gap in the GMOS-S spectrum between 0.69-0.81
micron is due to a faulty readout ampliﬁer on a portion of the GMOS-S detector plane. The have been normalized to unity
at 0.55 micron. The LRIS and GMOS-S data have been rebinned by a factor of 30 using an error-weighted mean. The
spectral ranges of V, S, Sq, and C-type asteroids from (DeMeo et al., 2009) are over-plotted in aqua, red, yellow, and gray
respectively.
