Abstract. We express the number of anti-invariant subspaces for a line ar
operator on a ﬁnite vector space in terms of the number of its i nvariant sub-
spaces. When the operator is diagonalizable with distinct e igenvalues, our
formula gives a ﬁnite-ﬁeld interpretation for the entries o f theq-Hermite Cata-
lan matrix. We also obtain an interesting new proof of Toucha rd’s formula for
these entries.

Anti-invariant subspaces were introduced by Barr´ ıa and Halmos [3 ]. A matrix
T∈Mn(Fq) is said to be ℓ-transitive if eachℓ×ℓmatrix over Fqappears as
the upper left submatrix of some matrix similar to T. Using the fact that Tis
ℓ-transitive if and only if it admits an ℓ-dimensional anti-invariant subspace, they
characterized ℓ-transitivematrices. Sourour[14]determinedthemaximaldimensio n
of an anti-invariant subspace. Kn¨ uppel and Nielsen [8] deﬁned a su bspaceWto be
k-fold anti-invariant if
dim(W+TW···+TkW) = (k+1)dim W,
and determined the maximal dimension of a k-fold anti-invariant subspace for a
linear operator T. They also showed [8, Thm. 2.1] that if d1≤d2≤ ··· ≤ dn
denote the degrees of the invariant factors in the Smith normal fo rm ofxI−A
whereAis the matrix Twith respect to some basis, then a k-fold anti-invariant
subspace of dimension mexists if and only if dn−m+1+···+dn≥(k+1)m.
Enumerative versions of such problems can be traced back to a pap er of Ben-
der, Coley, Robbins and Rumsey [4]. In the context of pseudorando m number
generation, Niederreiter [9] made the following deﬁnition: given T∈Mmd(Fq), an
m-dimensional subspace W⊂Fmd
qis said to be a T-splitting subspace of degree d
if
W+TW+···+Td−1W=Fmd
q.
Niederreiter asked for the number of m-dimensional T-splitting subspaces of degree
dwhen the characteristic polynomial of Tis irreducible, unaware that the question
had already been answered in [4]. The number of T-splitting subspaces in this case
is given by
qm(m−1)(d−1)qmd−1
qm−1.
Chen andTseng[5] reprovedthis resultby developingrecurrencer elationsinvolving
a larger class of combinatorial problems. Their recurrence relation s are indepen-
dent of the matrix T, and reduce the enumeration of splitting subspaces to the
enumeration of ﬂags of T-invariant subspaces. However, the recurrences are very
diﬃcult to solve in general.
Aggarwal and Ram [1] used the recurrences of Chen and Tseng to s how that
whenTis regular nilpotent, the number of T-splitting subspaces of degree dis
given by qm2(d−1). For regular nilpotent T,XT
j= 1 for 0 ≤j≤n, so (1) becomes
(3) ωT

Settingℓ=mandn= 2m, we recoverthe formula of [1] in the case d= 2. Later, it
came to light that these results in the regular nilpotent case follow fr om the results
in [4].
Viennot’s combinatorial theory of orthogonal polynomials [16] place s the mo-
ments of an orthogonal polynomial sequence in the ﬁrst column of a n inﬁnite arrayANTI-INVARIANT SUBSPACES 3
knownas the Catalan matrix. There is a connection between ourmain theorem and
the Catalan matrix associated to the q-Hermite orthogonal polynomial sequence as
deﬁned by Ismail, Stanton and Viennot [7]. This connection emerges from our work
[11, 12] where a more general class of enumerative problems is cons idered.
Definition 2.For a linear endomorphism T∈Mn(Fq) and a partition µ=
(µ1,...,µ k) ofn, a subspace W⊂Fn
qis said to have T-proﬁleµif
dim(W+TW+···+Ti−1W) =µ1+···+µifor each 1 ≤i≤k.
The number of subspaces with T-proﬁleµis denoted σT
µ.
Whenn=m+ℓ, a subspace Whas proﬁle ( m,ℓ) ifWism-dimensional, and
W+TW=Fn
q. LetT∗denote the transpose of T. For a subspace W⊆Fn
q,
letW0denote its annihilator in the linear dual of Fn
q. WhenWhas proﬁle ( m,ℓ),
dim(W0) =l. AlsoW+TW=Fn
qif and only if W0∩(TW)0= (W+TW)0={0}.
By using the identity
(4) dim( U∩S−1U) = 2dim U−dim(U+SU),
forS∈Mn(Fq) and each subspace U⊂Fn
q, it follows that
dim(W0∩(TW)0) = dim( W0∩(T∗)−1W0) = 2dim W0−dim(W0+T∗W0).
Therefore, Whas proﬁle ( m,ℓ) if and only if W0is anℓ-dimensional T∗-anti-
invariant subspace. Since Tis similar to T∗, we have

Let [n] denote the set consistingofthe ﬁrst npositiveintegers. Denote byΠ( µ′)
the set of partitions of [ n] whose block sizes are the parts of the integer partition
conjugate to µ. Suppose Tis a diagonalizable matrix with distinct eigenvalues in
Fq. One of the main results of [12] is a combinatorial formula for σT

Comparing the expressions in (7) and (9) gives a new, linear-algebra ic proof of
Touchard’s formula (8).4 ANTI-INVARIANT SUBSPACES
A road map. The proof of the main theorem consists of three parts which
take up the next three sections of this article.
In the ﬁrst part (Section 2) we establish the existence of a formula of the
form (12) for the number ωT
nℓof anti-invariant subspaces of a given dimension as
a linear combination of the numbers XT
jof invariant subspaces, whose coeﬃcients
are independent of T. It remains to show that the coeﬃcients of these linear
combinations are as in Eq. (2).
In the second part (Section 3) we consider a family of matrices for w hich the
number of anti-invariant subspaces is known. Each matrix in this fam ily gives rise
to an equation in the coeﬃcients of (12). Theorem 6 establishes tha t this system
of equations has a unique solution. Thus in order to show that the co eﬃcients are
exactly the ones given in (2), it suﬃces to show that the identity (1) holds for each
matrix in the family. This can be be expressed as the family (17) of iden tities.
In the third part (Section 4) we prove the identities (17) by reducin g them to
Heine’s transformations for q-hypergeometric functions.
The proof strategy in this article closely follows ideas in [13]; the main d is-
tinction is that the more general identity (17) needed here require s a very diﬀerent
approach.
The ﬁnal section (Section 5) of this article is devoted to the case wh ereTis a
diagonal matrix with distinct diagonal entries, and the connection t o the Catalan
matrix of q-Hermite orthogonal polynomials.
2. Existence of a Universal Formula
In this section we prove the existence of a universal formula for th e number
of anti-invariant subspaces of a given dimension for an arbitrary op eratorT. The
main step is Lemma 3, which is a special case of the recurrence of Che n and Tseng
[5, Lemma 2.7]. We begin by introducing some notation.
GivenT∈Mn(Fq) and sets AandBof subspaces of Fn
q, deﬁne
β(A,B) :={W∈A|W∩T−1W∈B},
γ(A,B) :={(W1,W2)|W1∈A,W2∈B,andW1∩T−1W1⊃W2}.
Forintegers a,b, wealsowrite β(a,b)forthesetof a-dimensionalsubspaces WofFn
q
such that W∩T−1Whas dimension b. The quantity γ(a,b) is deﬁned analogously.
For example, using identity (4), β(a,a) denotes the set of a-dimensional T-invariant
subspaces, whereas β(a,0) denotes the set of a-dimensional T-anti-invariant sub-
spaces. To explicitly specify the linear operator T, we also write βT(A,B) and
γT(A,B).

qis the disjoint

0≤k≤aβ(a,k), we have
γ(a,b) =/coproductdisplay
0≤k≤aγ(β(a,k),b).
To count pairs of subspaces ( W1,W2)∈γ(β(a,k),b), ﬁrst choose W1∈β(a,k)
and then choose W2to be an arbitrary b-dimensional subspace of W1∩T−1W1.It
follows that

0≤j≤bγ(a,β(b,j)).
To count pairs ( W1,W2)∈γ(a,β(b,j)),ﬁrst choose W2∈β(b,j) and note that
dim(W2+TW2) = 2b−jby (4).
GivenW2, a pair ( W1,W2) belongs to γ(a,β(b,j)) if and only if W1is ana-
dimensional subspace that contains W2+TW2. Therefore, the number of choices

expression of the stated form in ﬁnitely many steps. /square

ber of anti-invariant subspaces of a given dimension.6 ANTI-INVARIANT SUBSPACES

3. Determination of Coeﬃcients in the Universal Formula
We set up a system of linear equations which completely determine the poly-
nomials pj(t) (0≤j≤ℓ) in Corollary 5 by constructing, for each prime power
q, a sequence of matrices T0(q),...,T ℓ(q) such that the following conditions are
satisﬁed.
(1) For each 0 ≤i,j≤ℓ, there exists a polynomial Xij(t) such that XTi(q)
j=
Xij(q) for all prime powers q.
(2) The determinant of the matrix X(t) := (Xij(t))0≤i,j≤ℓis a non-zero ele-
ment ofZ[t].
(3) The identity (1) holds for Ti(q) fori= 0,...,ℓand all prime powers q.
In eﬀect, we have the following result.
Theorem 6.For each prime power q, the system of linear equations
(13) ωTi(q)

This solution is unique for suﬃciently large prime powers qand hence uniquely
determines the polynomials pj(t)for0≤j≤l.
We now proceed with the construction of the matrices Ti(q)(0≤j≤ℓ) above.
For each q, letT0(q) be any matrix in Mn(Fq) with irreducible characteristic poly-
nomial. For i= 1,...,ℓ, takeTi(q) to be the n×nmatrix with block decomposition

It remains to show that the values of pj(q) given by (14) are solutions to (13)
for 1≤i≤ℓ. We begin by showing that the left hand side of (13) vanishes in these
cases.
Lemma9.For1≤i≤ℓ, we have ωTi(q)
nℓ= 0.
Proof. TheFq[t]-module Mi=Fn

Mi=/braceleftBigg

Herefi(t) denotes the characteristic polynomial of T′
i(q) fori= 1,...,ℓ−1. Since
none of the modules Mi(1≤i≤ℓ) can be generated by n−ℓ+ 1 or fewer
generators, Ti(q) does not admit a subspace with proﬁle ( n−ℓ,ℓ). In other words,
ωTi(q)
nℓ=σTi(q)
(n−ℓ,ℓ)= 0 fori= 1,...,ℓ. /square
In view of Lemma 9, in order to establish (13) for Ti(q) (1≤i≤ℓ), it suﬃces
to prove the identity

The proof uses techniques from the theory of q-hypergeometric series, and appears
in Section 4.
The non-singularity of X(t) = (Xij(t))0≤i,j≤ℓis proved by using inequalities
satisﬁed by the degrees of its entries. We recall [13, Lemma 4.4].
Lemma10.Let(aij)n×nbe a real matrix such that whenever i < kandj < k,
aik−aij< akk−akj.
Then the sum S(σ) =/summationtext
1≤i≤naiσ(i)attains its maximum value precisely when σis

Proposition 11.For alln≥2l≥0, the determinant of the matrix X(t)is
non-zero. Therefore, for suﬃciently large prime powers q,detX(q)/ne}ationslash= 0.
Proof. ByEq.(15), the ﬁrstrowof X(t)istheunitvector(1 ,0,...,0). There-
foreitsuﬃcestoshowthatthedeterminantofthesubmatrix X′(t) = (Xij(t))1≤i,j≤ℓ

that, for 1 ≤i,j≤ℓ,
aij= max{j(n−ℓ+i−j),(j−ℓ+i)(n−j)}=j(n−ℓ+i−j),
since
j(n−ℓ+i−j)−(j−ℓ+i)(n−j) = (ℓ−i)(n−2j)≥0.
Ifi < kandj < k, then
aik−aij=k(n−ℓ+i−k)−j(n−ℓ+i−j)
= (k−j)(n−ℓ+i−k−j)
<(k−j)(n−ℓ−j)

Now Lemma 10 implies that det X′(t) has degree/summationtextℓ

This completes all steps in the proof of Theorem 6 except for the ide ntity (17).

5. The q-Hermite Catalan matrix
In this section, we discuss the connection between our main theore m and
Touchard’s formula for the entries of the q-Hermite Catalan matrix.
Anextended chord diagram is a visual representation of an involution σon
[n]. Arrange nnodes labelled 1 ,...,nalong the X-axis. To their right, add a node
labelled∞. A circular arc lying above the X-axis is used to connect the elements of
each 2-cycle of σ. Each ﬁxed point of σis connected to the node ∞. The extended
chord diagram of the involution (1 ,4)(2,6)(7,8) on the set [8] is shown below:
12345678∞
Acrossing is a pair of arcs [( i,j),(k,ℓ)] such that i < k < j < ℓ . The ex-
tendedchorddiagramabovehasfourcrossings,namely[(1 ,4),(2,6)],[(1,4),(3,∞)],
[(2,6),(3,∞)], and [(2 ,6),(5,∞)]. Letv(σ) denote the number of crossings of the
extended chord diagram of an involution σ.
Let Inv(n,k) denote the set of involutions in Snwithkﬁxed points. Deﬁne
(23) ank(q) =/summationdisplay
σ∈Inv(n,k)qv(σ).
Ifn−kis odd then Inv( n,k) =∅, soank(q) = 0. If n−kis even, then an element
of Inv(n,k) hasl:= (n−k)/2 cycles of length two.
For each non-negative integer k, let [k]qdenote the q-integer 1+ q+···+qk−1.
Lemma13.We have
a00(q) = 1, a0k= 0fork >0,
ank(q) =an−1,k−1(q)+[k+1]qan−1,k+1(q) (n >0).
Proof. Each involution σ∈Inv(n−1,k−1) can be extended to an element
of Inv(n,k) by adding nas a ﬁxed point. Furthermore, each σ∈Inv(n−1,k+1)
can be extended to an element of Inv( n,k) ink+1 diﬀerent ways: any one of its
k+ 1 ﬁxed points can be paired with n. Pairing the r-th ﬁxed point from right
to left with nresults in r−1 new crossings. Taken together, these k+ 1 choices
contribute (1 + q+···+qk)qv(σ)= [k+ 1]qqv(σ)toank(q). Since every element
of Inv(n,k) can be obtained uniquely by one of these methods, the identity of t he
lemma follows. /squareANTI-INVARIANT SUBSPACES 13

knownas the Touchard-Riordan formula . The polynomials an,n−2ℓare preciselythe
entries of the Catalan matrix associated to the normalized q-Hermite orthogonal
polynomials of Ismail, Stanton and Viennot [7]. See Aigner [2, Chapter 7 ] for a
comprehensive exposition.
The combinatorial theory of orthogonal polynomials [16] places the moments
of an orthogonal polynomial sequence in the ﬁrst column of a Catala n matrix: if
an orthogonal polynomial sequence {Pk(x)}k≥0satisﬁes the three-term recurrence
relation
Pk+1(x) = (x−bk)Pk(x)−λkPk−1(x) fork≥1,
withP0(x) = 1, P1(x) =x−b0,
for some {bk}k≥0and{λk}k≥1, withλk/ne}ationslash= 0, the entries of the Catalan matrix
(cnk)n,k≥0are given by
c00= 1, c0k= 0 fork >0,
cnk=cn−1,k−1+bkcn−1,k+λk+1cn−1,k+1.
The moments of the orthogonal polynomial sequence are
µn=cn0forn≥0.
Lemma 13 implies that the polynomials ank(q) of (23) are the entries ofthe Catalan
matrix with bk= 0 and λk= [k]q, which correspond to the combinatorial version
of theq-Hermite orthogonal polynomial sequence [7, Eq. (2.11)]. Thus Tou chard’s
polynomials Tm(q) are the even moments of the q-Hermite orthogonal polynomial
sequence (the odd moments being 0). This is well-known and plays a ro le in the
proof of the Touchard-Riordan formula [2, Chapter 7].
LetTbe ann×ndiagonalizable matrix with distinct eigenvalues in Fq. By
(5), the number of ℓ-dimensional T-anti-invariant subspaces is equal to the number
of subspaces with T-proﬁle (m,ℓ), where m=n−ℓ. The conjugate of the partition
µ= (m,ℓ) is the partition µ′= (2ℓ,1m−ℓ). Set partitions with ℓblocks of size
2 andm−ℓblocks of size 1 can be identiﬁed with involutions on [ n] withm−ℓ
ﬁxed points. The interlacing number [12, Defn. 3.3] of such a set par tition reduces
to the number of crossings of the extended chord diagram on the c orresponding
involution. Therefore, the formula (6) can be rephrased as follows .
