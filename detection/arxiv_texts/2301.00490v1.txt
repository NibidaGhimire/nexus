Cosmological tensions in current times have opened a wide door to study new probes to constrain
cosmological parameters, specically, to determine the value of the Hubble constant H0through
independent techniques. The two standard methods to measure/infer H0rely on: (i) anchored ob-
servables for the distance ladder, and (ii) establishing the relationship of the H0to the angular size of
the sound horizon in the recombination era assuming a standard Cosmological Constant Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) cosmology. However, the former requires a calibration with observables at nearby
distances, while the latter is not a direct measurement and is model-dependent. The physics behind
these aspects restrains our possibilities in selecting a calibration method that can help minimise
the systematic eects or in considering a xed cosmological model background. Anticipating the
possibility of deeply exploring the physics of new nearby observables such as the recently detected
black hole shadows, in this paper we propose standard rules to extend the studies related to these
observables. Supermassive black hole shadows can be characterised by two parameters: the angular
size of the shadow and the black hole mass. We found that it is possible to break the degeneracy
between these parameters by forecasting and xing certain conditions at high(er) redshifts, i.e.,
instead of considering the 10% precision from the EHT array, our results reach a 4%, a preci-
sion that could be achievable in experiments in the near future. Furthermore, we found that our
estimations provide a value of H0= 72:890:12 km/s/Mpc and, for the baryonic mass density,

m= 0:2750:002, showing an improvement in the values reported so far in the literature. We
anticipate that our results can be a starting point for more serious treatments of the physics behind
the SMBH shadow data as cosmological probes to relax tension issues.
1. INTRODUCTION
One of the most challenging problems of modern cosmology is the statistical tension on the estimation of the
expansion rate of the universe today: the Hubble constant H0. Dierent experiments, observables and predicted
theoretical models gives H0values that disagree strongly. Therefore, in order to determine H0, the distance to
observables on astrophysical and cosmological scales is one of the most relevant factors since measurements of this
constant in the local universe based on distance ladder methods do not match the estimated value in the early universe,
where the rst methodology takes into account serious statistical precision analysis and the latter considers a standard
cosmological model supported by observational evidence.
The most pressing issue, in particular for this tension, is the 5.0 disagreement between the local value given by
the SH0ES collaboration [1] ( H0= 73.041.04 km/s/Mpc) and the early estimated value given by the Planck
collaboration [2] ( H0= 67.270.60 km/s/Mpc). While measurements involved in each sector of the early and late
universe agree, e.g., CMB and BAO observations,1theH0tension persists at the ends of the empirical distance ladder.
Several proposals have been raised to nd a viable solution to this issue. On one hand, it is possible to consider late
H0measurements which do not require a benchmark model, such as the standard Cosmological Constant Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) model. On the other hand, early H0measurements can be performed if we assume a collection
of physical properties based on a pre-established model that can describe the evolution of the universe. A broad
compendium of these two paths for estimating H0can be found in [3].
While the core of the latter paths are based on rening our calibration methods or considering physics beyond the
standard CDM model, we should contemplate the possibility of exploring the nature of new observables that could
shed some light on the H0tension. In this direction, astronomical objects with greater diversity, both in distance and

1It is important to mention that the combination of CMB lensing and BAO data has raised serious outcomes related to the spatial
curvature of the universe, i.e., without considering these observables, Planck data tends to agree with a closed universe scenario [28, 29].arXiv:2301.00490v1  [astro-ph.CO]  2 Jan 20232
physical characteristics, are being used as standard rulers in our local universe. Among the proposals, it has been
suggested that we can use Black Hole (BH) shadows as standard rulers [4, 5].
The detection of the rst BH shadow of M87* by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHT) [6] opened a
new window to using this kind of rulers to independently determine the BH mass and its distance from the observer.
Through this mechanism, we can compute the physical size of the BH shadow and compare it with the observed size.
Along with the detection of M87* in our nearby galaxy, a second one, the shadow of the central BH in our galaxy,
Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) [7], has also been detected. In particular, supermassive black holes (SMBH) shadows are
interesting candidates to study our local universe since their physics is quite simple, and we can see them as standard
rulers if the relation between the size of the shadow and the mass of the SMBH that produces it, the so-called angular
size redshift , is established. To use these kinds of observables, we need to set two limits:
1. Measurements at low redshifts. SMBH shadows can be used to estimate H0in a cosmological independent way
and also without evoking the distance ladder method. By adopting a peculiar velocity of the host galaxy vp
in km/s, the mass of the SMBH Min solar masses Mand the angular size , we can directly compute the
distance to the SMBH. Finally, using the Hubble law, we can estimate H0. Clearly, performing this kind of
estimate using two SMBH shadows' data points (M87* and Sgr A*) is insucient, not only by the low data
point density, but also due their high uncertainties. However, we expect a future improvement in this direction
since the abundance of SMBHs can be hosted in spiral and elliptical galaxies [8]. At this scale,[9] proposed using
a mock SMBH shadow catalog as anchor in the distance ladder method, which can oer an estimation of H0.
2. Measurement at high redshifts. At this scale, determining the mass of the BH can be dicult due to the fact
that we need high resolution in the equipment, and the estimation of the uncertainties is quite large. However,
reverberation mappings [10] techniques combined with spectroastrometry analyses [11] have been employed
to determine BH mass and distance simultaneously. In [12], the authors proposed a set of simulated SMBH
shadows at this scale, which were performed by assuming a ducial benchmark cosmology, making it possible
to determine a set of cosmological parameters as 
 mandH0.
These approaches have set a convenient path to estimate H0. It is important to mention that both of them require
certain assumptions between a large SMBH shadows baseline to perform the statistics or higher resolutions in the
equipment to perform the observations. SMBH shadows as a cosmological probe are still new and lack statistical
power in comparison to other baselines. However, the future of these measurements looks bright and hopeful. While
the technological capacity is developing, we can start by considering more serious analyses behind their physics. Our
goal is to forecast a larger set of SMBH shadows by relaxing the assumptions made in the latter approaches. By doing
this, we will signicantly decrease the errors, and we will obtain a higher H0in comparison to the reported ones.
Recent works have studied the possibility of using BH shadow measurements from the Event Horizon Telescope
(EHT), e.g., to constrain astrophysical free parameters on a Kerr{Newman{Kiselev{Letelier BH conguration [13],
analyse cosmological constant corrections on the BH shadow radii [14], determine optical features from a Schwarzschild
MOG BH with several thin accretions [15], examine BH charges [16] and evaluate the eects in the Kerr{Newman
BH in quintessential dark energy scenarios [17].
This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review the characteristics in order to employ SMBH shadows as
standard rulers, and we describe the equations behind these. In Section 3, we present the algorithm to simulate SMBH
shadows and compare them with EHT observations. In addition, we include the process to perform this forecasting
at low and high(er) redshifts. In Section 4, we describe the current data sets employed in our analyses including the
compilation of the BH events and their observations (see Table I), and the new forecasted baseline. In Section 5, we
discuss the results obtained for our H0estimations performed with our mock data and present a comparison with
previous works. Finally, we give a summary of discussions in Section 6.
2. BLACK HOLE SHADOW DESCRIPTION AS STANDARD RULERS
A general way to describe the BH shadow in a realistic expanding universe is to consider the angular size/redshift
relation, which establishes the information between the apparent angular size of the BH and its redshift and how
this quantity changes at cosmological distances. Once this angular size is determined, we can compute the angular
diameter distance to the BH. The advantage to describing these physical distance relations is inspired by the fact that
SMBH shadows can be used as standard rulers [4], which makes them useful to determine H0in two regimes:
•Nearby galaxies (low redshift, z0:01), where SMBH shadows are cosmologically model-independent and do
not require methods that consider anchors in the distance ladder. By a simple calculation using the Hubble ow
velocity of a galaxy and its peculiar velocity, we can derive the Hubble velocity and constrain H0. In addition,
atz!0, the angular size of the BH shadow grows as the BH mass gets bigger, which makes it a suitable3
candidate to study our local universe in comparison to the BAO peaks, in which amplitude decreases due to
the cosmological expansion. However, since the angular size and the mass of the BH are linearly correlated, we
require precise techniques to break this degeneracy such as, for example, stellar-dynamics [18], gas-dynamics
[19] or maser observations [20, 21].
•High(er) distance observations (high(er) redshift 0 :01<z< 7 (z>7)), where not only do we require a ducial
cosmology to determine the BH mass, but also we require an angular resolution around 0.1 as. These kinds of
observations have been show to be extremely dicult [4]; however, by combining techniques such as reverberation
mappings [10] and very long baseline interferometry technologies, it will be possible to achieve such resolution.
Going further in distance, the search for quasars beyond z >7 [22] allows us to estimate BH masses at higher
redshift. While the uncertainties in these measurements are high, it is important to note that this is a reference
that SMBH shadows can be part of future catalogs, making them useful in proving the cosmic expansion at this
scale.
As far as we know, there have been two methodologies to constrain H0using SMBH shadows in the described
redshift ranges:
•Combination of M87observation and SNIa catalog [12]. This proposal allows us to study a particular set of
cosmological parameters by considering a collection of 10 BH shadows' simulated data points under a ducial
benchmark cosmology (
 m= 0:3 andH0= 70 km/s/Mpc) and the Pantheon SNIa catalog (see Section 4 for
its description). The results are reported in Table II. However, these simulations are restricted solely to BH
masses ofM= 3109Mwithin an interval 7 <z< 9, which, combined with SNIa observations, are not able
to constrain the CDM model.
•Combination of mock catalogues for SMBH ( 106BH simulated data points) plus mock SNIa data for the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST2. This proposal starts from the same point of view as the latter; however, the
mock SMBH data are used as anchors to calibrate the distance ladder. While the number of BH data points
simulated is high, the forecasting is based on a benchmark cosmology and a single shadow data from M87.
Furthermore, a cosmographic approach was employed at low redshift, making it impossible to constrain atthe
third order of the series, i.e., the jerk current value j0[9].
Our goal is to forecast a larger set of SMBH shadows by relaxing the assumptions made in the latter methodologies.
Additionally, we are going to consider a second shadow data: the Sgr A* observation [7].
To set the theoretical quantities, we need to write distance quantities in terms of the characteristics of the object
under study. In this work, we employ the standard denition of the luminosity distance for a at CDM model as
[23]:
dL(z) = (1 +z)c
H0I(z); (1)
wherecis the speed of light, H0is the present-day Hubble parameter and I(z) is given by the integral
I(z) =Zz
0 

m0(1 + ~z)3+ 
 0 1=2d~z; (2)
where 
 m0and 
 0are the present values of the critical density parameters for matter and a dark energy component,
respectively. The luminosity distance can be related to the angular diameter distance dA(z) by the reciprocity theorem
which states that [24]:
dL(z) = (1 +z)2dA(z): (3)
By denition, the angular diameter distance of an object is dA=L=, withLthe proper diameter of the object
and its observed angular diameter. If we are able to measure one of these distances at certain redshift z, then we
can obtain information about the cosmological parameters denoted in Equation (2).
Certainty, a BH does not emit photons. Moreover, we can observe the light rays that curve around its event horizon
and create a ring with a black spot in the center. We call this the shadow of the black hole. It is known that for a
Schwarzschild (SH) BH, the angular radius of its shadow is [25]:
sh(z) =3p
3m
dA(z); (4)
2www.lsst.org4
wherem=GM=c2is called the mass parameter of the black hole, Gbeing the constant of gravitation, cthe speed
of light and Mthe mass of the BH in solar masses units. This equation is an approximate expression for the
visible angular radius of the shadow when using the angular diameter distance dAby assuming a radial coordinate
large enough in comparison with the SMBH horizon in order to obtain an eective linear radius as 3p
3m. Using
Equations (1){(3), we can rewrite the above equations as:
sh=3p
3m
(1 +z)c
H0I(z): (5)
Notice that the BH shadow depends on its mass and distance, the Hubble constant H0and the free cosmological
parameters (
 m;
).
Using Equations (2) and (5), notice that at lower redshift we obtain
LR=3p
3mH 0
cz; (6)
where we can easily notice that given a value for the radius of the shadow LRand the redshift zof the BH with a
known mass, it is possible to directly determine a value of H0.
With Equation (3), we can establish the relation between the modulus distance and the distance modulus of the
source through:
=m(z) M= 5log10dL(z) + 25; (7)
wherem(z) andMare the apparent and absolute magnitude of the supernova, respectively.
Notice that in the latter equations, we have considered that the SMBHs are described by an SH metric with
spin zero. However, astrophysical SMBHs have rotation, and the spin eects can change the size described by
Equation (4). This leads us to consider a Kerr metric, where both the SMBH spin and the observer inclination angle
will change the BH shadow along the horizontal axis. Meanwhile, in the vertical axis line of sight, we conserve the SH
shadow. This asymmetric shadow size has been observed by the EHT collaboration; nevertheless, a set of numerical
phenomenological expressions is required in order to compute the right size of this shadow. A further study on these
key characteristics has been conducted in [9]. In the discussion section of this work, we mention how this treatment
does not aect the determination of the distance from the shadow.
3. BLACK HOLE SHADOWS FORECASTING
Detecting BH shadows requires a great deal of time and technological resources. In recent years, the EHT col-
laboration3has been able to observe two SMBH shadows, M87* and Sgr A*, and continues to work in search of
more of them and in dierent systems, e.g., binary systems. However, two data points are not statistically enough to
generate comprehensive astrophysical analyses let alone cosmological ones. In addition, reaching a sucient number
of observations that can signicantly constrain cosmological parameters can take a long period of time. Until we
can reach an optimal number of observations of such a kind, we can perform forecasting through the standard rule
methods.
In order to produce mock data for SMBH shadows M87* and Sgr A*, we use Equation (5) and its low redshift
approximation LR(6). Following this line of thought, we consider these steps:
1. Assume a conservative ducial cosmological model. In our case, instead of using a conservative Planck data
cosmology [26] as in other studies, we will consider the local values: H0= 73:8 km/s/Mpc, 
 m0= 0:262, where

0= 1 
m.
2. Under the above condition, we compute Equation (2) only as a function of the redshift z. Once the integral is
solved, we can use the reciprocity relation Equation (3) in Equation (5). This will be our main function, and it
takes as input values a set of two variables: the redshift zand the SMBH mass. We can consider this result for
the low redshift case as a cuto when z0:1. Notice that it is necessary to write these equations in BH shadow
units, e.g., M, and perform the appropriate conversion to express the results in as units. Additionally, we
need to assume an error in the simulations. In [12], the authors considered the M87* single data, which at
3eventhorizontelescope.org5
low redshift constrains H0with a 13% error. In order to reduce this number, it was considered a symmetric
uncertainty in this single data point as the variance takes the form Pp
N=; therefore, if we want to reach
a precision of P4%, we require N= 10 SMBH shadows simulations. While this assumption is reasonable
and the estimated error decreases by almost 8%, the mean value for H0does not change. Since we are going to
consider two SMBH shadows from M87* and Sgr A*, this symmetric uncertainty assumption will be relaxed in
order to reach a precision of 4% using a conservative quantity comparable with other observables at low z, e.g.,
SNIa, and a number of simulations derived from data with asymmetric errors at high z.
3. In comparison to the previous methodologies described in Section 2, in order to test our algorithm eectiveness,
we can compare the simulated SMBH shadows' outputs with the current M87and Sgr A* observations given
by the EHT. As we show in Figure 1, the simulations are very near to the observables, e.g., for Sgr A* we
have thatobserved = 26:41:15as, whilesimulated = 26:61:06as. For the M87* case, we have a value
observed = 211:5as, and our simulation gives simulated = 19:50:78as. The latter result gives a 4.7%
dierence from the simulated data point. This quantity is due to our pre-established precision since the error
percentage in the M87* observation is close to 7%, while for Sgr A* it is reduced to almost 4%.

We consider a conservative xed cosmology with H0= 73:8 km/s/Mpc, 
 m0= 0:262 to compare the observable radius with
its forecasted value.
Once we have tested our algorithm against the available observables, we can build a data points larger catalog that
can be used in our statistical analyses. To do so, we need to build a baseline with input data containing pairs of
redshift and SMBH mass ( z;M). In our case, we are going to generate two dierent mock catalogs: (i) for nearby
galaxies estimations (low redshift) and (ii) for high(er) redshift SMBH shadows. The architecture of our algorithm is
shown in Figure 2.
3.1. High(er) Redshift Observations for Hubble Constant Constraints
For high(er) redshift, we will simulate SMBH shadows within 7 z9. As we mentioned, since some quasar
observations can be reached in such a range, it is possible to observe SMBHs in this region if they have a minimum
of 109M. These types of BHs are viable as long as they have existed long enough to acquire larger masses, as,
e.g., in the case of primordial BH. Although the population of BHs in this range is expected to be large, if we take
into account the above conditions, then the number of BHs that meet these characteristics are drastically reduced;
therefore, we rst generate 10 random redshift values in the range of 7 z9 according to Step 2 described above.
For the SMBH masses, we will use a uniform random distribution that takes values in the range of 109 1010M.
Once we have the synthetic catalog with 10 random pairs as ( z;M), we can feed them into the simulation algorithm
described in Figure 2 and obtain the radii of the SMBH shadow associated with each pair. Our forecasted data is
shown at the left of Figure 3.6
FIG. 2: Architecture method to forecast SMBH shadows. The color boxes denote the physical quantities and priors (green
color), the setting of variables and units (blue color), the redshift cuto (orange color) and the computation employed (pink
color).
3.2. Nearby Galaxies Estimation Observations for Hubble Constant Constraints
Analogous to our previous forecasting, we will now simulate the SMBH shadows at low redshift. For this case, as
far as we know, most galaxies have a BH at their center; therefore, the possibility of observing them is greater in
comparison to high(er) redshift ranges. We will simulate a conservative quantity of 500 SMBH shadows and generate
random redshift values within 0 z2:5. We use a xed BH mass within 5 106M. Our synthetic catalog consists
of 500 random pairs ( z;M) from where we can obtain the radius of the BH shadow associated with each pair. In this
case, we add a noise to our data that does not exceed our precision of 4%. Our forecasted data is shown at the right
of Figure 3.
We will use both of these synthetic catalogs to implement Bayesian statistics in order to constrain the Hubble
constantH0.7

4. CURRENT AND SIMULATED DATA SETS
With the BH shadows forecasting now described, we can perform statistical analyses combining the simulated
catalogs at low and high(er) redshifts with local observables as SNIa using a 2-statistics method. The set of best
ts (h;
m) can be obtained through a process with a modied version on emcee-PHOEBE4for our cosmology and the
new baseline (SNIa + BH shadows) and the extract of constraints using GetDist5
In this paper we consider four dierent data sets:
•Pantheon SNIa catalog [27]. This catalog contains data of 1048 SNIa, observed in the range of low redshift from
0:01< z < 2:3. For each supernova, the redshift zand the apparent magnitude m(z) are given, which allows
us to build the modulus distance by xing the absolute magnitude M. In this analysis, we use the value
M= 19:3, for one case.
•EHT direct observations. This set contains data from the two observations of the SMBH M87* and Sgr A*. For
each observable, their mass mis given inMunits, the redshift zand the radius of their shadow in as units.
A compilation of these data is given in Table I.
•High redshift SMBH shadows. This set contains 10 simulated shadows for SMBH between 7 z9 (see Figure
3 at the left). For each forecasted BH, its redshift z, the size of its radius in as and the error in this radius are
given. Details are described in Section 3.1.
•Low redshift SMBH shadows. This set contains 500 simulated shadows for SMBH between 0 :1z2 (see
Figure 3 at the right). For each forecasted BH its redshift z, the size of its radius in as and the error in this
radius are given. Details are described in Section 3.2.

its reference; the second column, the zat which they were observed; the third and fourth columns, the radius in microarc-second

Along with the analysis, we use the reduced Hubble constant h, dened as h=H0=100 [km/s/Mpc]. In the case of

In Figure 4, we show the reduced hfor: (i) the SMBH shadows observed by the EHT array, and (ii) the combination
of both SMBH shadows observed using our algorithm. Notice that the M87* shadow exceeds the SNIa Pantheon
statistical range, which is obvious since we are computing a posterior with a single distant point in zin comparison
to the Sgr A* shadow (which is nearest to our Milky Way galaxy), whose H0values lies at 1 within the SNIa data
set. Furthermore, the combination of M87* + Sgr A* gives a higher value of H0at the 1border.

In Figure 5, we show the condence contours for each of our analyses: (i) When we consider the non-calibrated
SNIa full catalog, a constraint value for 
 mcan be obtained, while the H0fails to be constrained. (ii) The simulated9
SMBH shadows at high(er) redshift have weak constraints on the 
 mparameter. This leads to our nal analysis: (iii)
the combination of SNIa data plus SMBH mock data at low z, which can constrain the cosmological parameter in a
local redshift range (
 m;H0). (iv) Once we consider a calibrated SNIa full catalog (green color), we notice a tension
between this catalog and the SMBH shadows simulations (red color).
A full compilation of the resulting pair (
 m;H0) are given in Table II for each result reported in the literature, their
baseline and the results obtained using our analyses. This table is complemented with a whisker plot given in Figure
6. Notice that the value for H0using forecasting SMBH shadows at low zunder the assumptions described in our
architecture gives an uncertainty lower than the ones reported in other methodologies. Additionally, our combined
catalog SNIa + SMBH at high z reduces the tension in comparison to the direct EHT observations.

6. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we proposed extending the studies of supermassive black holes shadows as standard rulers order to
study theH0tension. A BH cast a shadow in the neighborhood area of emission with a shape and size that can
be computed using the location of the several photon orbits at dierent directions with respect to the spin axis.
Furthermore, the angular size of shadows from a high redshift BH can increase due to cosmic expansion, hence the
possibility to nd constraints on the expansion history at high redshift.
The advantage of these SMBH shadows is the property that can be characterised by two parameters: the angular
size of the shadow at low and high redshifts and the BH mass. Moreover, a degeneracy between these parameters
can arise at high redshift since assumptions on the precision of the experiment need to be taken into account.
In order to break the degeneracy, in this paper we propose a viable forecasting method by xing certain conditions
at high(er) redshifts, i.e our results reach 4%, a precision that could be achievable in future experiments and
with optimistic conditions. Furthermore, we found that our estimations provide a value of H0= 72:890:12 and

m= 0:2750:002, showing an improvement in the systematics reported so far in the literature for the SMBH
standard rulers, including SN catalog in the total dataset analysis. Is important to mention that we recover the initial
H0xed prior (see Step 1 in Sec.3) when solely it is considered the SMBH simulated sample (see the corresponding
result in red color in the right part of Figure 5). In addition, our value at high(er) redshifts, H0= 72:03:4 and

m= 0:2850:029, improves upon the systems reported at 8% [9], in fact, our systematic results are reduced to 4.7%.
We stress out that more general BH scenarios can be considered, for example, BH with spin and inclination variation
as Kerr BHs. It was determined that these characteristics do not modify the determination of distances from the
SMBH shadows [9]. In fact in general terms, the BH mass and the angular shadow size are the only two parameters
that contribute signicantly even in this spin-inclination BH system. Furthermore, we should mention that the
treatment of a database that include SMBH forecastings and observational data like SN could bring relative weight
issues combined with the fact that is necessary the assumption of an initial prior on H0. However, we expect that
the precision obtained in this system can be improved using our methodology discussed here. We will report this11
elsewhere.
Currently, SMBH shadow observations are still few; therefore the calculations derived from low data point statistics
cannot accurately constrain a set of cosmological parameters. However, as we presented in this paper, studying the
precision assumptions that can be used for future experiments could allow us to promote these observables as future
candidates in the many baselines used in cosmological tensions research.
