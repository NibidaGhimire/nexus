Katz middle convolution
Kazuki Hiroe∗and Haru Negami†
Abstract
The Long-Moody construction is a method to obtain represent ations of braid
groups introduced by Long and Moody. Also the Katz middle con volution is known
to be a method to construct local systems on C\{n-points}introduced by Katz. In
this paper, we explain that these two methods are naturally u niﬁed and deﬁne a
new functor which we call the Katz-Long-Moody functor. This functor extends the
framework of Katz algorithm to categories of local systems o n various topological
spaces, for example, Bn-bundles associated with simple Weierstrass polynomials,
complements of hyperplane arrangements of ﬁber-type, link complements in the
solid torus, and so on.

Introduction
Katz introduced in his famous book [14] a machinery constructing lo cal systems on
C\{n-points}, and this eﬃcient machinery and the algorithm for constructing loca l sys-
tems are called Katz middle convolution and Katz algorithm. This machin ery plays
important roles not only for number theory, but also for various ar eas in mathematics.
At the same time, Long and Moody introduced a method to construc t representations
of braid groups in [18] as a natural generalization of Burau represe ntation. This Long-
Moodyconstruction is known to be an eﬃcient way to obtain braid gro up representations.
For example, Burau representation, Gassner representation, J ones representations, and
etc., are obtained through the Long-Moody construction, see [18 ], [1]. Also it has many
applications for knot invariants, see [5] and [24], and homological sta bility, see [22], and
so on.
This paper explains that these two seemingly diﬀerent machineries by Katz and Long-
Moody are naturally uniﬁed through the twisted homology theory. T his enable us to
establish the Katz algorithm not only for local systems on C\{n-points}but also for
those on many other topological spaces whose fundamental grou ps are related to braid
groups.
Let us explain our results more precisely. Let us take a pair ( G,α) of a group Gand
a homomorphism α:G→AutGrp(Fn), which factors through the Artin representation
θ:Bn֒→AutGrp(Fn). Then we can deﬁne the semi-direct product Fn⋊αG. In particular,
2whenGis a free group Fsof ranks, the map α:Fs→Bnis called the braid monodromy
map associated with ρ:=θ◦α:Fs→AutGrp(Fn), which is introduce by Moishezon [19]
to obtain explicit descriptions of fundamental groups of plane algeb raic curves, see also
[4] by Cohen and Suciu. More generally, when Gis a fundamental group of a topological
space with the homotopy type of a CW-complex, the group Fn⋊αGappears as the
fundamental group of the complement of a polynomial covering in th e sense of Hansen
[7].
Then we shall construct the following functor as a generalization of the Long-Moody
construction of braid group representations.
Theorem 0.1 (Twisted Long-Moody functor) .Letkbe a ﬁeld and let us take λ∈k×.
Then there exits an endfunctor LMλof the category of left k[Fn⋊αG]-modules such that
the following holds.
1. Suppose that (G,α) = (Bn,θ). Then the functor Resk[Fn⋊αBn]
k[Bn]◦LM λis isomorphic
to the Long-Moody functor.
2. Suppose that G={e}and identify Fn⋊α{e}withFn. Then the functor LMλis
isomorphic to the convolution functor introduce by Dettwei ler-Reiter in [6].
HereResR
Pfor the rings P⊂Ris the restriction functor from the category of left R-
modules to that of left P-modules.
We call this functor LMλthe twisted Long-Moody functor.
TheconvolutionfunctorappearingintheabovewasintroducedbyD ettweiler-Reiter in
preparation for deﬁning the Katz middle convolution under their set ting in [6]. According
to the deﬁnition of Katz middle convolution in [6], we shall deﬁne a new fu nctor from the
twisted Long-Moody functor and show that this new functor exte nds the Katz algorithm
tok[Fn⋊αG]-modules.
Theorem 0.2. Let us take λ∈k×. There exists a full subcategory ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG]of the
categoryof left k[Fn⋊αG]-modulesandalso existsan endfunctor KLM λofthis subcategory
such that the following holds.
1. Suppose that G={e}and identify Fn⋊α{e}withFn. Then the functor KLM λis
isomorphic to the Katz middle convolution functor introduc ed in [6].
2. (Multiplicativity). For λ,τ∈k×, we have the isomorphism
KLM λ◦KLM τ∼=KLM λτ
as endfunctors of ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG].
3. (Auto-equivalence). For λ∈k×,KLM λis an auto-equivalence of the category
ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG], andKLM λ−1is an inverse functor.
We call this functor KLM λthe Katz-Long-Moody functor.
The resemblance between the Katz middle convolution and the Burau representation
had already been pointed out by V¨ olklein in [25]. Our deﬁnition of the Ka tz-Long-Moody
functor is based on this V¨ olklein’s idea and generalizes his insight into t he relationship
between the Katz middle convolution and braid group representatio ns.
AswellastheusualKatzmiddleconvolution, weshallshowthattheK atz-Long-Moody
functor preserves the irreducibility.
3Theorem 0.3. If a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-moduleVisFn-irreducible, then KLM λ(V)isFn-
irreducible for any λ∈k×.
Herethe Fn-irreducibleisalittlestrongerconditionwhichimpliestheusualirreduc ibil-
ity. Therefore, the Katz-Long-Moody functor enable us to cons truct many irreducible
k-local systems on various topological spaces.
We shall further give a homological interpretation of the Katz-Lon g-Moody functor
which naturally arises from Katz’ original deﬁnition of the middle conv olution in terms
of perverse sheaves. Let Qn={1,...,n}be the set of points in C. Also consider the set
Q0,∞
n={0,1,...,n,∞}of points in the Riemann sphere P1=C⊔{∞}. For the conﬁgu-
ration spaceF2(C\Qn) ={(t,z)∈(C\Qn)2|t/\e}a⊔io\slash=z}of 2 points in C\Qn, we consider pro-
jection maps prt:F2(C\Qn)∋(t,z)/maps⊔o→t∈C\Qn, prt−z:F2(C\Qn)∋(t,z)/maps⊔o→t−z∈C×,
and the embedding ι:P1\Q0,∞
n∋t/maps⊔o→(t,0)∈F2(C\Qn).
Thenforaleft k[Fn⋊αG]-module VandtheKummerlocalsystem KλonC×associated
with the character χλ:π1(C×)∼=Z→k×satisfying χλ(1) =λ, we deﬁne the new left
k[Fn⋊αG]-module in terms of homology groups with local system coeﬃcients by
MCλ(V) = Im(H1(P1\Q0,∞

t−z(Kλ)))).
HereHBM

of locally ﬁnite chains. Then we shall show the following.
Theorem 0.4. Forλ∈k×\{1},KLM λandMCλare isomorphic as endfunctors of the
category of left k[Fn⋊αG]-modules.
As we shall explain in the ﬁnal section of this paper, categories of lef tk[Fn⋊αG]-
modules for several ( G,α) are isomorphic to categories of k-local systems on various
important topological spaces. Therefore we can establish a frame work of the Katz algo-
rithmontheselocalsystems. Asatypical example, wecanconsider Bn-bundlesassociated
with simple Weierstrass polynomials in the sense of Hansen. It is known that some com-
plements of hyperplane arrangements are obtained as these Bn-bundles. For instance,
complements of hyperplane arrangements of ﬁber-type have the Bn-bundle structure.
Whereas, in particular for complements of hyperplane arrangemen ts, Haraoka deﬁned an
analogue of the Katz middle convolution for logarithmic connections o ver complements
of hyperplane arrangements in [8]. The Katz-Long-Moody functor will provide the local
system counterpart of this Haraoka’s middle convolution through t he Riemann-Hilbert
correspondence in some cases.
Furthermore, we shall explain that categories of left k[Fn⋊αG]-modules can be iden-
tiﬁed with categories of k-local systems on link complements in the solid torus. Note
that link complements in the solid torus are equivalent to the compleme nts of mixed links
inS3, see [17]. There are many known methods to obtain irreducible repre sentations of
knot groups, see Kronheimer and Mrowka [16], Klassen [15], Herald [11 ], and references
in Heusener [12] for instance, and then the Katz-Long-Moodyfun ctor gives a new method
to obtain irreducible representations of knot groups.
The Katz-Long-Moody functor will also useful to ﬁnd integral rep resentations of solu-
tions of diﬀerential equations with accessory parameters. In gen eral, it may not be able
to expect that diﬀerential equations with accessory parameters have solutions expressed
by integrations whose integrands are written by some elementary f unctions. As we shall
4explain in this paper, however, the Katz-Long-Moody functor will g ive a way to ﬁnd
some special non-rigid local systems whose corresponding diﬀeren tial equations may have
solutions with integral representations.

1 Twisted Long-Moody functor
Long and Moody introduced a functor between categories of linear representations of the
mixed braid group B1,n∼=Fn⋊Bnand that of Bnin the paper [18]. We shall consider a
slight generalization of this functor which we call the twisted Long-M oody functor, and
explain some properties of this new functor.
1.1 Artin representation of the braid group Bnon the free group
Fn
The Artin braid group Bnassociated with a positive integer n≥2 is the group presented
byn−1 generators σ1,σ2,...,σ n−1with the braid relations
σiσj=σjσifor alli,j= 1,2,...,n−1 with|i−j|>2,
σiσi+1σi=σi+1σiσi+1for alli= 1,2,...,n−2.
Now we recall the Artin representation of Bnon the free group Fnof rankn. We take
x1,...,x nas a set of free generators of Fn. LetQnbe the set of points ai:= (i,0),
i= 1,2,...,ninR2andDa closed Euclidean disk in R2centered at (( n−1)/2,0) which
contains Qnin its interior. We write the mapping class group of the topological pair
(D,Qn) asM(D,Qn), which consists of isotopy classes of self-homeomorphism of the p air
(D,Qn) ﬁxing the boundary ∂Dpointwise. For each i= 1,...,n−1, we deﬁne the
elementτi∈M(D,Qn) called the half-twist as follows. We may suppose that the radius
ofDis suﬃciently large and identify R2with the complex plane Cas topological spaces.
Let us set ci:= (ai+1−ai)/2, and then we deﬁne the homeomorphism τi:D→Dby
τi(z−ci) :=

z−ci (|z−ci|≥1)
exp(−2πi|z−ci|)(z−ci) (1
2≤|z−ci|<1)
−(z−ci) ( |z−ci|≤1
2).
Then it is known that these half-twists τ1,τ2,...,τ n−1generate the group M(D,Qn) and
the correspondence
η:Bn−→M(D,Qn)
σi/maps⊔o−→ τi
extends to the group isomorphism.
5The fundamental group π1(D\Qn,d) with a base point d∈∂Dis known to be isomor-
phic tothe free group Fn. To give a precise description of theisomorphism, we ﬁx thebase
pointd= ((n−1)/2,−R) whereRis the radius of D. Then for each i= 1,...,nwe take
the closed path γi: [0,1]→D\Qnwith the base point das follows. Let us ﬁx a suﬃciently
smallǫ >0 so that D<ǫ(ai) :={z∈C||z−ai|< ǫ}are inside Dfor alli= 1,...,nand
have no intersections with the other D<ǫ(aj) forj/\e}a⊔io\slash=i. Letιibe the intersection point
ofD<ǫ(ai) and the line segment daiconnecting dandai. Then we take the closed path
γi: [0,1]→D\Qnwith the base point dso that it is homotopic to the path going from
dtoιialong the segment daiand encircling clockwise aialong the circle ∂D<ǫ(ai) and
ﬁnally going back from ιitodalong the segment dai. Then it is known that π1(D\Qn,d)
is freely generated by γ1,...,γ n. Thus the correspondence π1(D\Qn,d)∋γi/maps⊔o→xi∈Fn
extends to the group isomorphism.
The product α·β: [0,1]→Xof paths α,β: [0,1]→Xin a topological space X
satisfying α(1) =β(0) is deﬁned by
α·β(t) :=/braceleftigg
α(2t) (t∈[0,1/2])
β(2t−1) (t∈[1/2,1]).
The push-forward of a path γ: [0,1]→Xby a continuous map φ:X→Yof topo-
logical spaces is denoted by φ∗(γ) :=φ◦γ: [0,1]→Y. Since the base point d∈∂Dis
ﬁxed byM(D,Qn), the push-forward deﬁnes the group homomorphism
θ:M(D,Qn)−→AutGrp(π1(D\Qn,d))
φ/maps⊔o−→ φ∗,
which is known to be injective and characterized by the following relat ions,
θ(τi)(γj) =

γi+1 j=i
γ−1
i+1γiγi+1j=i+1
γj j/\e}a⊔io\slash=i, i+1.
Here Aut Grp(G) denotes the group of automorphisms of a group G. Then, under the
identiﬁcations π1(D\Qn,d)∼=FnandM(D,Qn)∼=Bndeﬁned above, this map θinduces
the injective group homomorphism
θArtin:Bn֒→AutGrp(Fn),
which is called the Artin representation ofBnonFn.
We extend this Artin representation of Bnto some other groups as follows.
Deﬁnition 1.1 (Artin representation of a group GonFn).For a group G, we call a group
homomorphism α:G→AutGrp(Fn), or the pair ( G,α) of them, an Artin representation ,
ifαfactors through the Artin representation θArtin:Bn֒→AutGrp(Fn) ofBn. Namely,
there exists a group homomorphism αBn:G→Bnwhich makes the diagram
G AutGrp(Fn)
Bnα
αBn
θArtin
commutative. Here we note that αBnis unique since θArtinis injective.
61.2 Long-Moody functor
Letus consider theouter semi-direct product Fn⋊θArtinBnwhich we simply denoteby Fn⋊
Bnif there is no risk of confusion. We recall a procedure for construc ting representations
ofBnfrom those of Fn⋊Bnwhich is called the Long-Moody construction of braid group
representations introduced by Long and Moody in [18].
1.2.1 Long-Moody induced representation and augmentation ideal of free
group
Let us recall the deﬁnition of Long-Moody induced representation .
Deﬁnition 1.2 (Long-Moody induced representation) .Letkbe a ﬁeld, Vak-vector
space, and ρ:Fn⋊Bn→Autk(V) a group homomorphism. Here Aut k(V) is the auto-
morphism group of the k-vector space V. Then the Long-Moody induced representation
associated with ρis the linear representation
ρLM:Bn→Autk(V⊕n)
ofBnwhich is deﬁned by
ρLM(σi) :=
i−1/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright

ρ(σi)

fori= 1,...,n−1. Here the matrices in the right hand side are block matrices whose
entries are in Aut k(V).
This can be seen as a generalization of the Burau representation. I n fact, the repre-
sentation ρis 1-dimensional, the resulting ρLMis exactly the Burau representation. In
the paper [18], several approaches to deﬁne ρLMare explained. Among them, we explain
the following construction by using the augmentation ideal of Fn.
Letk[G] denote the group ring generated by a group Gover a ﬁeld k. A group
homomorphism ρV:G→Autk(V) fromGto the automorphism group of a k-vector
spaceVinduces the left k[G]-module structure on Vand vice versa. We frequently do
not distinguish between them. Let IGbe theaugmentation ideal of the group ring k[G]
which is the two-sided ideal deﬁned as the kernel of the augmentation map
k[G]∋/summationdisplay
g∈Grgg/maps⊔o−→/summationdisplay
g∈Grg∈k.
7Let us go back to the setting in Deﬁnition 1.2. Let us regard Vas the left k[Fn⋊Bn]-
module by the representation ρand then consider the vector space IFn⊗k[Fn]V. We deﬁne
a leftk[Bn]-module structure on IFn⊗k[Fn]Vby
b·(i⊗v) :=θArtin(b)(i)⊗(b·v) (b∈Bn, i∈IFn, v∈V).
SinceIFnis freely generated by xi−1, i= 1,...,nas the right k[Fn]-module, the k-linear
map
IFn⊗k[Fn]V∋n/summationdisplay
i=1(xi−1)⊗vi/maps⊔o−→(v1,...,v n)∈V⊕n(1)
is an isomorphism through which V⊕nis equipped with the action of Bn. Then a direct
computation tells us that this Bn-action on V⊕ncoincides with the Long-Moody induced
representation ρLM:Bn→Autk(V⊕n).
Wecanslightly generalizethisprocedureasfollows. Letconsider ase mi-direct product
groupFn⋊αGassociated with an Artin representation ( G,α) and take a left k[Fn⋊αG]-
moduleV. ThenIFn⊗k[Fn]Vhas the natural k[G]-module structure through the Artin
representation α:G→Aut(Fn).
Deﬁnition 1.3 (Long-Moody functor) .For ak-algebra R, we write the category of left
R-modules by ModR. Let (G,α) be an Artin representation on Fn. Then we deﬁne a
functorLM:Modk[Fn⋊αG]→Modk[G]by
1.
LM(V) :=IFn⊗k[Fn]V
forV∈O(Modk[Fn⋊αG]),
2.
LM(φ) := id IFn⊗φ∈Homk[G](LM(V),LM(W))
forV,W∈O(Modk[Fn⋊αG]) andφ∈Homk[Fn⋊αG](V,W),
and call this functor the Long-Moody functor . Here O(C) denotes the class of objects in
a categoryC.
Let us note that the augmentation ideal IFnis ﬂat as the right k[Fn]-module since this
is free. Therefore the Long-Moody functor which is deﬁned by the tensor product with
the ﬂat module IFnis an exact functor.
1.2.2 Multiplication map
Let (G,α) be an Artin representation on FnandVa leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module. Then we
deﬁne ak-linear map from LM(V) toVby
∇:IFn⊗k[Fn]V∋/summationdisplay
ifi⊗vi/maps⊔o−→/summationdisplay
ifi·vi∈V,
8which we call the multiplication map . This is moreover a k[G]-module homomorphism

1.3 Twisted Long-Moody functor
The Long-Moody functor is a functor between Modk[Fn⋊αG]andModk[G]. We can extend
this to the endfunctor of Modk[Fn⋊αG]in the obvious way. Namely, by the left k[Fn]-
module structure of IFnas the two-sided ideal, we can deﬁne the left Fn-module structure
onLM(V) =IFn⊗k[Fn]Vwhich is obviously compatible with the k[G]-module structure
and thusLM(V) can be seen as a left k[Fn⋊αG]-module.
Now we shall introduce a twisted version of this left k[Fn]-module structure which is
compatible with the k[G]-module structure.
1.3.1 Twisted Long-Moody functor
Let us ﬁx an element λ∈k×and consider the following functions
λ≥i:{1,...,n}∋j/maps⊔o→/braceleftigg
λifj≥i,
1 ifj < i,
fori= 0,1,...,n. Then we deﬁne a left action of FnonIFnby
xi◦λ(xj−1) :=λ≥i(j)xi(xj−1)−(λ≥(i−1)(j)−1)(xj−1) (i,j= 1,...,n).
Ifλ= 1, this action coincides with the usual left action of FnonIFnas the left ideal of
k[Fn].
Proposition 1.4. The left action◦λofFnis compatible with the G-action through the
Artin representation α. Namely, the diagram
IFnIFn
IFnIFnα(g)
x◦λ α(g)(x)◦λ
α(g)
is commutative for every g∈Gandx∈Fn.
Proof.It suﬃces to consider the case ( G,α) = (Bn,θArtin) which follows from a direct
computation. Alternatively, we can use the homological interpreta tion ofIFngiven in
Proposition 2.20 which appears later.
9Thispropositionenableustoregard IFnasaleftk[Fn⋊αG]-module. Emphasizing that
this module structure depends on the choice of λ∈k×, we write this k[Fn⋊αG]-module
especially by IFn,λ. Then for a left k[Fn⋊αG]-module V, we can regard IFn,λ⊗k[Fn]Vas
a leftk[Fn⋊G]-module.
Remark 1.5. Letρ:Fn⋊αG→Autk(V) andρLM
λ:Fn⋊αG→Autk(IFn,λ⊗k[Fn]V) the
associated homomorphisms with the left k[Fn⋊αG]-modules VandIFn,λ⊗k[Fn]V. Then

forV,W∈O(Modk[Fn⋊αG]) andφ∈Homk[Fn⋊αG](V,W),
is called the twisted Long-Moody functor with respect to λorλ-twisted Long-Moody func-
tor.
Here we note that the twisted Long-Moody functor is an exact fun ctor as well as the
usual Long-Moody functor.
101.3.2 Augmentation ideal and multiplication map
As previously we saw, the multiplication map ∇is ak[G]-module homomorphism. When
we consider the twisted action of Fnon the augmentation ideal, the multiplication map
∇becomes moreover a k[Fn⋊αG]-module homomorphism as below.
Lemma 1.7. Let us take x∈Fnandg,h∈IFn. Then the following twisted associativity
holds,
(x◦λg)◦µh=x◦λµ(g◦µh).
Proof.We may suppose that x=xi,g=xj−1,h=xk−1 for some i,j,k∈{1,...,n}.
First we note that
(xj−1)◦µ(xk−1) =µ≥j(k)xj(xk−1)−µ≥(j−1)(k)(xk−1)
=µ≥j(k)((xj−1)(xk−1)+(xk−1))−µ≥(j−1)(k)(xk−1)
=µ≥j(k)(xj−1)(xk−1)+(µ≥j(k)−µ≥(j−1)(k))(xk−1)
=/braceleftigg
µ≥j(k)(xj−1)(xk−1) ifj/\e}a⊔io\slash=k,
µ(xj−1)xj−(xj−1) ifj=k.
Here the ﬁnal equation follows from the fact
ν≥i(j)−ν≥(i−1)(j) =/braceleftigg
0 if j/\e}a⊔io\slash=i,
ν−1 ifj=i,forν∈k×. (2)
Thus in any case, we can write ( xj−1)◦µ(xk−1) = (xj−1)rwith some r∈k[Fn].
Therefore we have
xi◦λµ((xj−1)◦µ(xk−1)) =xi◦λµ(xj−1)r
= (λµ)≥i(j)xi(xj−1)r−((λµ)≥(i−1)(j)−1)(xj−1)r
= (λµ)≥i(j)xi((xj−1)◦µ(xk−1))
−((λµ)≥(i−1)(j)−1)((xj−1)◦µ(xk−1)).(3)
On the other hand, we have
(xi◦λ(xj−1))◦µ(xk−1)
= (λ≥i(j)xi(xj−1)−(λ≥(i−1)(j)−1)(xj−1))◦µ(xk−1)
=λ≥i(j)xi◦µ((xj−1)◦µ(xk−1))−(λ≥(i−1)(j)−1)(xj−1)◦µ(xk−1)
=λ≥i(j)µ≥i(j)xi((xj−1)◦µ(xk−1))
−(λ≥i(j)µ≥(i−1)(j)−λi(j)+λ≥(i−1)(j)−1)((xj−1)◦µ(xk−1)).(4)
Now let us note that
λ≥i(j)µ≥i(j) = (λµ)≥i(j) (5)
λ≥i(j)µ≥(i−1)(j)−λi(j)+λ≥(i−1)(j)−1 = (λµ)≥(i−1)(j)−1. (6)
Here the second equation follows from equation (2).
Comparing the equations from (3) to (6), we obtain the desired equ ation
xi◦λµ((xj−1)◦µ(xk−1)) = (xi◦λ(xj−1))◦µ(xk−1).
11This lemma shows that the multiplication map ∇deﬁnes the following left k[Fn⋊αG]-
modules homomorphism.
Proposition 1.8. Forλ,µ∈k×, the multiplication map
∇:IFn,λ⊗k[Fn]IFn,µ−→IFn,λµ
is a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module homomorphism.
Proof.As previously we saw, ∇is ak[G]-module homomorphism. Thus we need to check
that∇is compatible with left actions of k[Fn] onIFn,λ⊗k[Fn]IFn,µandIFn,λµ, which follows
from Lemma 1.7.
Remark 1.9. It follows from Proposition 1.8 that the multiplication map deﬁnes the
natural transformation between the functors
∇:LMλ◦LM µ−→LM λµ.
We present some properties of the multiplication map which will be used later.
Proposition 1.10. For a left k[Fn⋊αG]-moduleV, letρV:Fn→Autk(V)be the asso-
ciated group homomorphism.
1. The image of the multiplication map ∇:IFn⊗k[Fn]V→Vis
Im(ρV(x1)−1)+···+Im(ρV(x1)−1).
Also the kernel is
/braceleftigg

i=1(xi−1)vi= 0/bracerightigg
,
under the identiﬁcation IFn⊗k[Fn]V∼=V⊕nby the isomorphism (1).
2. Let us take λ,µ∈k×. Then the kernel of the multiplication map ∇:LMλ◦
LMµ(V)→LM λµ(V)is
n/circleplusdisplay
i=1((xi−1)⊗Ker(ρµ
V(xi)−1)).
Hereρµ
V:Fn→Autk(LMµ(V))is the induced group homomorphism by the left Fn-action
onLMτ(V), and for x∈IFnand a subspace W⊂V, we setx⊗W:={x⊗w|w∈W}.
Proof.The ﬁrst assertion is obvious from the deﬁnition of ∇. The second one follows
from the fact
Im(ρµ
V(xi)−1)⊂(xi−1)⊗V
which can be easily seen by the matrix representation of ρµ
V(xi) appearing in Remark
1.5.

In this section, we provide a homological interpretation of this Euler transform and
explain thatthe twisted Long-Moodyfunctor canbeobtained from thishomological Euler
transform.
2.1 Homological Euler transform
In this paper, locally constant sheaves of k-vector spaces on a topological space Xare just
calledk-local systems on X. IfXis a connected topological manifold, it is well-known
that the stalkLdatd∈Xof ak-local systemLonXhas the structure of left k[π1(X,d)]-
module, and conversely, any left k[π1(X,d)]-module Ldcan be seen as the stalk at dof
somek-local system. Therefore we frequently do not distinguish betwee n them.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Kummer local system) .Letωbe the closed path in C×encircling the
origin counterclockwise along the unit circle with the base point 1. For a 1-dimensional
representation ρ:π1(C×,1)→GL1(k), the corresponding local system over C×is called
Kummer local system which is denoted by Kλwith the index λ:=ρ(ω)∈k×.
Let us considerF2(C\Qn) ={(t,z)∈C2|t/\e}a⊔io\slash=zandt,z /∈Qn}, the conﬁguration
space of 2 points in C\Qn, and prtand przrespectively denote the ﬁrst and second
projections ofF2(C\Qn). Also we consider the map
prt−z:F2(C\Qn)∋(t,z)/maps⊔o−→t−z∈C×.
LetLbe ak-local system on C\QnandKλa Kummer local system, and then we
consider the k-local system onF2(C\Qn) deﬁned by
Cλ(L) := pr∗
t(L)⊗kpr∗
t−z(Kλ).
Let us set Qn(z) :=Qn∪{z}forz∈C\Qn. Then we can naturally identify the ﬁber
pr−1
z(z) withC\Qn(z) and obtain the embedding map ιz:C\Qn(z)֒→F2(C\Qn) through
this identiﬁcation.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Homological Euler transform of a local system) .For every open disk
D<r(z)⊂C\Qn, we deﬁne the embedding ιr,z: (C\Qn)\D<r(z)֒→ F2(C\Qn) as the
composite of ( C\Qn)\D<r(z)֒→C\Qn(z) andιz:C\Qn(z)֒→ F2(C\Qn). Then we
associate this open set with the singular homology group with local co eﬃcient
H1((C\Qn)\D<r(z);ι∗
r,z(Cλ(L)))
13toevery opendisk D<r(z)⊂C\Qn. Sinceopendisks D<r(z) constituteabaseofopensets
inC\Qn(z), wecansheaﬁfythiscorrespondenceandthen Eλ(L)denotestheresultingsheaf
onC\Qnwhich is a k-local system whose stalks areisomorphic to H1(C\Qn(z);ι∗
z(Cλ(L)))
atz∈C\Qn. We call this k-local systemEλ(L) thehomological Euler transform of the
local system Lwith respect to the Kummer local system Kλ.
There are many equivalent deﬁnitions for homology groups of local c oeﬃcients and
we adopt the following deﬁnition among them in this paper. For a conne cted topological
manifold Xand ak-local system L, we regard Las a left k[π1(X,x)]-module by taking
the stalk at x. Then the k-vector space of singular n-chains with coeﬃcients in Lis
Cn(X;L) :=Cn(/tildewideX;k)⊗π1(X,x)L
whereCn(/tildewideX;k) is thek-vector space of usual singular n-chains in the universal covering
πX:/tildewideX→XofX. ThenH∗(X;L) are deﬁned as homology groups of the chain complex
C∗(X;L).
In the deﬁnition of Cn(X;L),Cn(/tildewideX;k) is regarded as a right k[π1(X,x)]-module as
follows. Let us consider the natural isomorphism
δ:π1(X,x)−→Deck(πX)
where Deck( πX) is the group of deck transformations of πX:/tildewideX→X. Since the deﬁnition
ofδdepends on the choice of ¯ x∈π−1
X(x), we give the precise deﬁnition here for the
accuracy. We associate δ(γ)∈Deck(πX) with each γ∈π1(X,x) as below. For each
c∈/tildewideXwe consider the path σc: [0,1]→/tildewideXfrom ¯xtocwhich is unique up to homotopy.
Thenδ(γ)(c)∈/tildewideXis the end point of the lift of γ·(πX)∗(σc) to/tildewideXstarting at ¯ x.
Now we deﬁne the right action of π1(X,x) on the set of singular n-simplices Sn(/tildewideX) by
Sn(/tildewideX)×π1(X,x)∋(σ,γ)/maps⊔o−→δ(γ−1)∗(σ)∈Sn(/tildewideX)
which extends to the right action of π1(X,x) onCn(/tildewideX;k). Here for a continuous map
φ:X1→X2of topological spaces, we write the induced map of singular simplices
byφ∗:Sn(X1)∋σ/maps⊔o→φ◦σ∈Sn(X2) which linearly extends to the k-linear map
φ∗:Cn(X1;k)→Cn(X2;k) of chains.
2.2 Euler transform functor of Mod k[Fn⋊αG]
The homological Euler transform Eλwas introduced inthe previous section as anendfunc-
tor of the category of k-local systems on C\Qn. We explain that this functor naturally
extends to the endfunctor of Modk[Fn⋊αG].
Let (G,α) be an Artin representation on FnandVa leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module. Then un-
dertheidentiﬁcations π1(C\Qn,d)∼=π1(D\Qn,d)∼=Fn,Visseenasaleft k[π1(C\Qn,d)]-
module. Thus we obtain the local system Eλ(V) onC\Qn, and as the stalk at z∈C\Qn
the homology group
Eλ(V)z=H1(C\Qn(z);ι∗
z(Cλ(V)))
appears. We shall see that this homology group is naturally equipped with an action of
Fn⋊αG.
To provide an accurate explanation, we take z∈C\Qnas the origin 0 and write it
bya0:=z= 0. We take the closed disk Das large as it contains Qn(a0) ={a0=
140,a1= 1,...,a n=n}in its interior. We write the half-twist interchanging aiand
ai+1byτifor each i= 0,1,...,n−1 as in Section 1. Then M(D,Qn(a0)) is gener-
ated byτ0,τ1,...,τ n−1and contains M(D,Qn) as the subgroup generated by τ1,...,τ n−1.
Throughtheisomorphism M(D,Qn(a0))∼=Bn+1, thegeneratorsof Bn+1corresponding to
the half-twists τ0,τ1,...,τ n−1are denoted by σ0,σ1,...,σ n−1respectively. Since elements
inM(D,Qn(a0)) areidentity maps on ∂D, we can regardthem asself-homeomorphisms of
C\Qn(a0)byextendthemasidentity outside D. Asaset ofgeneratorsof π1(C\Qn(a0),d),
we take closed path γiencircling ai,i= 0,1,...,nas well as in Section 1.
2.2.1Fn⋊αG-actions on π1(C\Qn(a0),d)andCn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0);k)
Let us consider the subgroup of Bn+1generated by σ2
0,σ1,...,σ n−1and denote it by B1,n.
Then we can see that x1:=σ2
0, x2:=σ1x1σ−1
1, ... ,x n:=σn−1xn−1σ−1
n−1generate the free
groupFn, andB1,ndecomposes as the inner semidirect product B1,n=Fn⋊Bnwhere
Bnacts onFnthrough the Artin representation. Then it follows that Fn⋊αGacts on
C\Qn(a0), i.e, we obtain the group homomorphism
η:Fn⋊αG−→AutTop(C\Qn(a0))
which is the composition of the following maps; the ﬁrst one is the map
Fn⋊αG∋(x,g)/maps⊔o→(x,α(g))∈Fn⋊Bn,
the second one is the inclusion Fn⋊Bn∼=B1,n⊂Bn+1∼=M(D,Qn(a0)), and the ﬁnal
one is the inclusion M(D,Qn(a0))֒→AutTop(C\Qn(a0)). Here Aut Top(X) denotes the
group of self-homeomorphisms of a topological space X. Then this ηallows us to deﬁne
the following left action of Fn⋊αGonπ1(C\Qn(a0),d),
(Fn⋊αG)×π1(C\Qn(a0),d)∋(h,γ)/maps⊔o−→η(h)∗(γ)∈π1(C\Qn(a0),d).
Also we deﬁne an action of Fn⋊αGonCn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0);k) as follows. Fix an element
¯d∈π−1
C\Qn(a0)(d). Then for each h∈Fn⋊αG, letη(h):/tildewiderC\Qn(a0)→/tildewiderC\Qn(a0) be the
unique lift of πC\Qn(a0)◦η(h):/tildewiderC\Qn(a0)→C\Qn(a0) satisfying η(h)(¯d) =¯d.
/tildewiderC\Qn(a0) /tildewiderC\Qn(a0)
C\Qn(a0)C\Qn(a0)η(h)
πC\Qn(a0) πC\Qn(a0)
η(h)
The uniqueness of the lift induces ( η(h))−1=η(h−1) andη(h1)◦η(h1) =η(h1h2) for
h,h1,h2∈Fn⋊αG. Thus ¯η:Fn⋊αG→AutTop(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0)) becomes a group homomor-
phism and deﬁnes the left action of Fn⋊αGonSn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0)) by
(Fn⋊αG)×Sn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0))∋(h,σ)/maps⊔o−→¯η(h)∗(σ)∈Sn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0)),
which extends linearly to the action on Cn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0);k).
Now we recall that this ¯ ηis compatible with the isomorphism δ:π1(C\Qn(a0),d)→
Deck(πC\Qn(a0)), i.e., we have the following.
15Lemma 2.3. The diagram
/tildewiderC\Qn(a0) /tildewiderC\Qn(a0)
/tildewiderC\Qn(a0) /tildewiderC\Qn(a0)¯η(h)
δ(γ) δ(η(h))∗(γ))
¯η(h)
is commutative for each h∈Fn⋊αGandγ∈π1(C\Qn(a0),d).
Proof.This is well-known.
2.2.2Fn⋊αG-action on ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))
Let us deﬁne a group homomorphism ˜ η:Fn⋊αG→Autk(V⊗Kλ) by
˜η(x)(v⊗κ) :=v⊗κ forx∈Fn,andv⊗κ∈V⊗kKλ,
˜η(g)(v⊗κ) :=gv⊗κ forg∈G,andv⊗κ∈V⊗kKλ.
Then we check that ˜ ηis compatible with the π1(C\Qn(a0),d)-action on ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)) =
V⊗kKλ. Namely, the diagram
ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)) ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))
ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)) ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))˜η(h)
γ· η(h)∗(γ)·
˜η(h)
is commutative for every h∈Fn⋊αGandγ∈π1(C\Qn(a0),d).
Recall that ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)) is the k[π1(C\Qn(a0),d)]-module which equals to V⊗kKλas
ak-vector space, and the π1(C\Qn(a0),d)-action on ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)) is given by
γ·(v⊗κ) = (prt◦ιa0)∗(γ)·v⊗(prt−z◦ιa0)∗(γ)·κ
forγ∈π1(C\Qn(a0,d)),v∈Vandκ∈Kλ.
Firstwe lookatthehomomorphism (prt◦ιa0)∗:π1(C\Qn(a0),d)→π1(C\Qn,d). Since
prt◦ιa0is the inclusion map C\Qn(a0)֒→C\Qnandγ0inC\Qn(a0) is homotopic to the
constant path in C\Qn, we can see that the group homomorphism (prt◦ιa0)∗coincides
with the projection map
pr0:Fn+1=/a\}b∇acke⊔le{⊔x0,x1,...,x n/a\}b∇acke⊔∇i}h⊔ −→Fn=/a\}b∇acke⊔le{⊔x1,...,x n/a\}b∇acke⊔∇i}h⊔

for which the inclusion map inc 0:Fn=/a\}b∇acke⊔le{⊔x1,...,x n/a\}b∇acke⊔∇i}h⊔∋xi/maps⊔o→xi∈Fn+1=/a\}b∇acke⊔le{⊔x0,x1,...,x n/a\}b∇acke⊔∇i}h⊔
is a retraction homomorphism, i.e., pr0◦inc0= idFn.
Let us regard elements in M(D,Qn(a0)) as self-homeomorphisms of the complex plane
C. Since the subgroup B1,nofM(D,Qn(a0)) preserves Qn, it acts not only on D\Qn(a0)
but also on D\Qn. Thus we have the commutative diagram
C\Qn(a0)C\Qn
C\Qn(a0)C\Qnprt◦ιa0
σ σ
prt◦ιa0
for eachσ∈B1,n.
16Lemma 2.4. The subgroup BnofB1,nacts onπ1(C\Qn,d)by the Artin representation.
The subgroup FnofB1,ngenerated by x1=σ2
0, x2=σ1x1σ−1
1, ... ,x n=σn−1xn−1σ−1
n−1
acts trivially on π1(C\Qn,d).
Proof.The above commutative diagram induces the commutative diagram
π1(C\Qn(a0),d)π1(C\Qn,d)
π1(C\Qn(a0),d)π1(C\Qn,d)(prt◦ιa0)∗
σ∗σ∗
(prt◦ιa0)∗.
Then this diagram tells us that the map σ∗:π1(C\Qn,d)→π1(C\Qn,d) decomposes as
π1(C\Qn,d)inc0−−→π1(C\Qn(a0))σ∗−→π1(C\Qn(a0))(prt◦ιa0)∗−−−−−→ π1(C\Qn,d)
for every σ∈B1,n. This immediately shows the ﬁrst assertion.
On the other hand, since we have
(σ2
0)∗(γi) =

γ−1
1γ0γ1 ifi= 0,
(γ0γ1)−1γ1(γ0γ1) ifi= 1,
γi otherwise ,forγi∈π1(C\Qn(a0),d),
the equation (prt◦ιa0)∗(γ0) = 1 shows that ( x1)∗= (σ2
0)∗:π1(C\Qn,d)→π1(C\Qn,d) is
the identity map. Then it inductively follows that all ( xi)∗:π1(C\Qn,d)→π1(C\Qn,d)
are also the identity maps for i= 1,...,n.
The following is a direct consequence of this lemma.
Corollary 2.5. Through the isomorphism π1(C\Qn,d)∋γi/maps⊔o→xi∈Fn, we regard
α:G→AutGrp(Fn)as the group homomorphism α:G→AutGrp(π1(C\Qn,d)). Then
the equations
(prt◦ιa0)∗◦η(g)∗(γ) =α(g)((prt◦ιa0)∗(γ))
hold for all g∈Gandγ∈π1(C\Qn(a0),d), i.e., the diagrams
π1(C\Qn(a0),d)π1(C\Qn(a0),d)
π1(C\Qn,d) π1(C\Qn,d)η(g)∗
(prt◦ιa0)∗ (prt◦ιa0)∗
α(g)
are commutative. Also for x∈Fn, we have
(prt◦ιa0)∗◦η(x)∗(γ) = (prt◦ιa0)∗(γ).
Next we see the homomorphism (prt−z◦ιa0)∗:π1(C\Qn(a0),d)→π1(C×,d−a0).
Similarly as above, we can see that the group homomorphism (prt−z◦ιa0)∗coincides with
the projection map
pr0:Fn+1=/a\}b∇acke⊔le{⊔x0,x1,...,x n/a\}b∇acke⊔∇i}h⊔ −→ F1=/a\}b∇acke⊔le{⊔x/a\}b∇acke⊔∇i}h⊔

retraction homomorphism.
The homeomorphism C∋z→z−a0∈C, allows us to deﬁne the action of the
subgroup B1,nofM(D,Qn(a0))onC×whichiscompatiblewiththaton C\Qn(a0)through
prt−z◦ιa0:C\Qn(a0)֒→C×. Thus similarly as Lemma 2.4 and Corollary 2.5, we obtain
the following lemma and its corollary.
Lemma 2.6. B1,nacts trivially on π1(C×,d−a0).
Corollary 2.7. For allh∈Fn⋊αG, we have
(prt−z◦ιa0)∗◦η(h)∗(γ) = (prt−z◦ιa0)∗(γ).
Combining Corollaries 2.5 and 2.7, we obtain the following desired result.
Proposition 2.8. For each h∈Fn⋊αGandγ∈π1(C\Qn(a0),d), the diagram

for allγ∈π1(C\Qn(a0),d) andv⊗κ∈V⊗Kλ=ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)). Here we use Corollary 2.5
in 4th and 5th equations and use Corollary 2.7 in 6th equation.
2.2.3Fn⋊αG-action on Cn(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
Let us deﬁne a left action of Fn⋊αGonCn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0))⊗k(V⊗kKλ) by
h·(σ⊗w) := ¯η(h)◦σ⊗˜η(h)(w) for σ∈Cn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0)), w∈V⊗kKλ,andh∈Fn⋊αG.
Then the following proposition assures that this induces the left Fn⋊αGaction on
Cn(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))).
Proposition 2.9. The kernel of the projection map
π:Cn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0))⊗k(V⊗kKλ)→Cn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0))⊗k[π1(C\Qn(a0),d)]ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))
is preserved by the left Fn⋊G-action.
18Proof.Let us take σ∈Cn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0)),w∈V⊗kKλ, andγ∈π1(C\Qn(a0),d) arbitrarily.
Then for h∈Fn⋊αG, we have
h·(σ·γ⊗w−σ⊗γ·w)
=h·(δ(γ−1)◦σ⊗w−σ⊗γ·w)
= ¯η(h)◦δ(γ−1)◦σ⊗˜η(h)(w)−¯η(x)◦σ⊗˜η(h)(γ·w)
=δ(η(x)∗(γ−1))◦¯η(x)◦σ⊗˜η(h)(w)−¯η(x)◦σ⊗η(x)∗(γ)·˜η(h)(w)
= (¯η(x)◦σ)·η(x)∗(γ)⊗˜η(h)(w)−(¯η(x)◦σ)⊗η(x)∗(γ)·˜η(h)(w)∈Kerπ
as desired.
2.2.4 Euler transform functor of Mod k[Fn⋊αG]
The left Fn⋊αG-action on Cn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))) is compatible with the boundary
map, and thus it induces the left Fn⋊αG-action on Hn(/tildewiderC\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))).
Deﬁnition 2.10 (Euler transform functor of Modk[Fn⋊αG]).Forλ∈k×, we deﬁne the
functorEλ:Modk[Fn⋊αG]→Modk[Fn⋊αG]by
Eλ(V) :=H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))) for V∈O(Modk[Fn⋊αG]).
Also for φ∈Homk[Fn⋊αG](V,W), we deﬁneEλ(V)∈Homk[Fn⋊αG](Eλ(V),Eλ(W)) by the
homomorphism H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))→H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(W))) induced from
φ:V→W.
2.3 Euler transform and twisted Long-Moody functor
The Pochhammer contour integral is a classical tool to describe th e analytic continua-

Γ(γ)
Γ(α)Γ(γ−α)/integraltext∞
1tβ−γ(t−1)γ−α−1(t−z)−βdtwith respect to the parameters α,β, andγ. We
shall explain that the Pochhammer contour integral gives a standa rd decomposition of
the homology group H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))).
2.3.1 Open covering of C\Qn(a0)
Take an open cover C=X1∪Y1so that
1.X1andY1are connected,
2.X1∩Qn(a0) ={a0,a1},Y1∩Qn(a0) ={a0,a2,...,a n}andd∈X1∩Y1,
3.X1\{a0,a1},Y1\{a0,a2,...,a n}, andX1∩Y1\{a0}respectively contain γ0∪γ1,
γ0∪γ2∪...∪γn, andγ0as deformation retracts.
PutX∗

a0(Cλ(V))|Xdenotes the pull-back of ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)) by the inclusion map ιX:X ֒→
C\Qn(a0) for a subspace X⊂C\Qn(a0).Then under the assumption λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1 we can show
the following.
19Proposition 2.11. Suppose that λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1. Then the above Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence
gives the k-linear isomorphism
H1(X∗

Proof.It suﬃces to show Hi(X∗
1∩Y∗
1;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|X∗
1∩Y∗
1) ={0},i= 0,1.
First we recall that the 0-th homology group H0(X;W) with a k[π1(X)]-module W
is isomorphic to W/W0as vector spaces, where W0is the subspace of Wgenerated by
(x−1)·wforx∈π1(X) andw∈V. Since the generator γ0ofπ1(X∗
1∩Y∗
1,d) acts on
ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|X∗
1∩Y∗
1as the multiplication of the scalar λ, the assumption λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1 deduce the
equation ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)) =ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))0, which shows H0(X∗
1∩Y∗
1;ι∗
a0(Cλ(L))|X∗
1∩Y∗
1) ={0}.
For the 1st homology group, the following well-known lemma and the as sumption
λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1 deduce H1(X∗
1∩Y∗

a0(Cλ(V)))∼=ι∗

{w∈W|h·w=wfor allh∈H}is theH-invariant subspace of k[H]-module Wfor a
groupH.
Lemma 2.12. Let us take the point s0:= (1,0)∈R2and closed path ω: [0,1]∋t/maps⊔o→
(cos2πt,sin2πt)∈R2inS1. LetπS1:/tildewideS1→S1be the universal cover. We ﬁx a point
˜s0∈π−1
S1(s0)and write the lift of ωto/tildewiderS1starting at ˜s0by˜ω. Then, for a left k[π1(S1,s0)]-
moduleW, the map
Wπ1(S1,s0)∋v/maps⊔o−→/tildewideω⊗v∈H1(S1;W)
is ak-linear isomorphism.
Proof.This is a standard fact in algebraic topology, see [10] for example.
Let us look at H1(Y∗
1;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|Y∗
1) and take an open cover Y1=X2∪Y2so that
1.X2andY2are connected,
2.X2∩Qn(a0) ={a0,a2},Y2∩Qn(a0) ={a0,a3,...,a n}andd∈X2∩Y2,
3.X2\{a0,a2},Y2\{a0,a3,...,a n}, andX2∩Y2\{a0}respectively contain
γ0∪γ2,γ0∪γ3∪...∪γn, andγ0as deformation retracts.
PutX∗
2:=X2\{a0,a2}andY∗

gives us the decomposition

202.3.2 Pochhammer cycles
For a path connected subspace U⊂C\Qn(a0) containing d, we write the inclusion map
byιU:U ֒→C\Qn(a0) and consider the universal cover πU:/tildewideU→U. Let us ﬁx a point
¯dU∈π−1
U(d) and write the unique lift of ιU◦πUto the universal cover /tildewiderC\Qn(a0) sending
¯dUto¯dby/tildewideιU.
/tildewideU /tildewiderC\Qn(a0)
U C\Qn(a0)/tildewiderιU
πU πC\Qn(a0)
ιU
For a path γinUstarting at d,/tildewideγdenotes the unique lift of γto/tildewideUstarting at ¯dU. Then
/tildewideιU∗(/tildewideγ) is the lift of γto/tildewiderC\Qn(a0) starting at ¯d.
For two elements a,bin a group H, we write the commutator of them by [ a,b] :=
a−1b−1ab.
Deﬁnition 2.13 (Pochhammer cycle) .1-chains /tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗c∈C1(X∗
i;ι∗
a0(Cσ(V))|X∗
i) for
c∈ι∗
a0(Cσ(V)) are called Pochhammer cycles inX∗
i. Also 1-chains /tildewiderιX∗
i∗(/tildewider[γ0,γi])⊗c∈
C1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cσ(V))) are called Pochhammer cycles in C\Qn(a0).
As we see below, a Pochhammer cycles is not just a chain but literally a c ycle.
Lemma 2.14. Forc∈ι∗
a0(Cσ(V))we consider /tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗c∈C1(X∗
i;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|X∗
i).
Then/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗cis a cycle, i.e., it is contained in the kernel of the boundary map
∂1:C1(X∗
i;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|X∗
i)→C0(X∗
i;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|X∗
i).
Similarly, the Pochhammer cycle /tildewiderιX∗
i∗(/tildewider[γ0,γi])⊗cinC\Qn(a0)is also a cycle.
Proof.The second assertion follows from the ﬁrst one since /tildewiderιX∗
iinduces a chain map. Let
us show the ﬁrst assertion. Since γ0acts onι∗
a0(Cλ(V)) as the multiplication of scalar λ,
we have the following as desired,
∂1(/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗c) =/tildewider[γ0,γi](0)⊗c−/tildewider[γ0,γi](1)⊗c
=¯dX∗
i⊗c−[γ0,γi]·¯dX∗

=¯dX∗
i⊗c−¯dX∗
i⊗λ−1·λ(γ−1
i·γi)c
=¯dX∗
i⊗c−¯dX∗
i⊗c= 0.
It follows that H1(X∗
i;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|X∗
i) is generated by Pochhammer cycles, as below.
Proposition 2.15. Under the assumption λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1, the map
Pochi:ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))∋c/maps⊔o−→/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗c∈H1(X∗
i;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|X∗
i)
is a linear isomorphism.
Before showing this, we prepare the following lemmas.
21Lemma 2.16. Let us suppose λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1. Let us take an open cover X∗
i=Uai∪Ua0where
Uai(resp.Ua0) is the intersection of X∗
iand an open neighborhood of ai(resp.a0) inC.
We assume that UaiandUa0contain respectively γiandγ0as deformation retracts and
moreover assume that the intersection Uai∩Ua0is simply connected. Then there exists an
isomorphism
H1(X∗
i;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|X∗
i)∼− →H0(Uai∩Ua0;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|Uai∩Ua0).
In particular, we have the isomorphism H1(X∗
i;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|X∗
i)∼=ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))as vector
spaces.
Proof.The second assertion immediately follows from the ﬁrst one since we h aveH0(Uai∩
Ua0;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|Uai∩Ua0)∼=ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)) from the simply connectedness of Uai∩Ua0.
We set¯V=ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)) for simplicity. Recalling that γ0·v=λvfor allv∈¯V, and
alsoλ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1, we obtain H0(X∗
i;¯V|X∗
i) ={0}andHj(Ua0;¯V|Ua0) ={0},j= 0,1, as in
Proposition 2.11. Therefore the Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequen ce gives us the following
exact sequence.
{0}→H1(Uai;¯V|Uai)→H1(X∗
i;¯V|X∗
i)
δ− →H0(Uai∩Ua0;¯V|Uai∩Ua0)→H0(Uai;¯V|Uai)→{0}
Let us consider the multiplication map ( γi−1):¯V∋v/maps⊔o→(γi−1)v∈¯Vand then we
obtain that
H1(Uai;¯V|Uai)∼={v∈¯V|(γi−1)·v= 0}= Ker(γi−1),
H0(Uai;¯V|Uai)∼=¯V/{(γi−1)v|v∈¯V}= Coker( γi−1),
sinceUaiis homotopy equivalent to S1. Thus it follows that
H1(Uai;¯V|Uai)∼=Ker(γi−1)∼=Coker(γi−1)∼=H0(Uai;¯V|Uai)
since every vector space is an injective and projective module, and therefore the kernel
and cokernel of an endmorphism of a vector space are isomorphic in general.
Thus we obtain that Ker δ∼=Cokerδ. Moreover, since vector spaces are injective and
projective, we have isomorphisms
H1(X∗
i;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|X∗
i)∼=Coimδ⊕Kerδ,
H0(Uai∩Ua0;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|Uai∩Ua0)∼=Imδ⊕Cokerδ.
Then isomorphisms Ker δ∼=Cokerδand Coim δ∼=Imδinduce the desired isomorphism.

L. Then the following is well-known as a key lemma for the Mayer-Vietoris long exact
sequence and proved by the similar argument as for usual singular h omology groups with
constant coeﬃcients.
Lemma 2.17. LetXbe a topological manifold and X=A∪Ban open covering. Let L
be ak-local system on X. We consider the sum CA
n(X;L)+CB
n(X;L)in the vector space
Cn(X;L). Then we have the following.
221. The inclusion map CA
n(X;L)+CB
n(X;L)֒→Cn(X;L)induces the isomorphism of
homology groups.
2. We have a short exact sequence
{0}→Cn(A∩B;L|A∩B)f− →Cn(A;L|A)⊕Cn(B;L|B)

Heref, gare deﬁned as follows. The map gis the sum of the maps Cn(∗;L|∗)→C∗

induced by the inclusions ∗֒→Xfor∗=A,B, andfis the diﬀerence of the maps
Cn(A∩B;L|A∩B)→Cn(∗;V|∗)from inclusions A∩B ֒→∗for∗=A,B.
Now we come back to the proof of the proposition.
Proof of Proposition 2.15. Lemma 2.16 tells us that H1(X∗
i;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|X∗
i) is isomorphic
toι∗
a0(Cλ(V)) as a vector space. Thus we only need to check the injectivity of t he map
Pochifrom the freeness of vector spaces.
Let us write ¯V=ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)). We assume that v∈¯Vsatisﬁes Poch i(v) = 0 and will
show that v= 0. We take the same cover X∗
i=Uai∪Ua0as in Lemma 2.16. Let us
consider the commutative diagram
C2(Uai∩Ua0)C2(Uai)⊕C2(Ua0)CUai
2(X∗
i)+CUa0
2(X∗

f1

∂1∂1
f0 g0,
following from Lemma 2.17, where we omit the coeﬃcients ¯Vfor simplicity. We note that
horizontal sequences are exact and also note that fiare injective and giare surjective.
Bythe assumption, Poch i(v) =/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗vishomologousto 0. Thus fromthesurjectiv-
ityofg2, there exits σ2∈C2(Ua1;¯V|Ua1)⊕C2(Ua0;¯V|Ua0) such that /tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗v=∂2◦g2(σ2).
On the other hand, we have
/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗v=/tildewidestγ−1
0⊗v+/tildewidestγ−1
i⊗(γ0·v)+/tildewideγ0⊗(γiγ0·v)+/tildewideγi⊗(γ−1
0γiγ0·v)
=/parenleftig/tildewidestγ−1
i⊗λc+/tildewideγi⊗(γi·v)/parenrightig
+/parenleftig/tildewidestγ−1
0⊗v+/tildewideγ0⊗λ(γi·v)/parenrightig
,
which shows that
g1/parenleftig/parenleftig/tildewidestγ−1
i⊗λv+/tildewideγi⊗(γi·v)/parenrightig
+/parenleftig/tildewidestγ−1
0⊗v+/tildewideγ0⊗λ(γi·v)/parenrightig/parenrightig
=/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗v.
From the commutativity of the diagram, we also have g1◦∂2(σ2) =/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗v. Therefore
it follows from the injectivity of f1that there uniquely exists σ1∈C1(Uai∩Ua0;¯V|Uai∩Ua0)
such that
f1(σ1) =/parenleftig/tildewidestγ−1
i⊗λv+/tildewideγi⊗(γi·v)/parenrightig
+/parenleftig/tildewidestγ−1
0⊗v+/tildewideγ0⊗λ(γi·v)/parenrightig
−∂2(σ2).
23By the way, the image of/parenleftig/tildewidestγ−1
i⊗λc+/tildewideγi⊗(γi·v)/parenrightig
+/parenleftig/tildewidestγ−1
0⊗v+/tildewideγ0⊗λ(γi·v)/parenrightig
∈
C1(Ua1;¯V|Ua1)⊕C1(Ua0;¯V|Ua0) by the boundary map ∂1is
/parenleftbig¯dUai⊗−(λ−1)(γi−1)v/parenrightbig
+/parenleftbig¯dUa0⊗(λ−1)(γi−1)v/parenrightbig
,
which is the image of ¯dUai∩Ua0⊗−(λ−1)(γi−1)v∈C0(Uai∩Ua0;¯V|Uai∩Ua0) byf0. Then
from the injectivity of f0, we have
∂1(σ1) =¯dUai∩Ua0⊗−(λ−1)(γi−1)v.
Thus we obtain ( λ−1)(γi−1)v= 0 from the following two facts. One is that we
haveC0(Uai∩Ua0;¯V|Uai∩Ua0) =C0(Uai∩Ua0;k)⊗k¯VsinceUai∩Ua0is simply con-
nected. Another is that for a 0-connected topological space Y, the image of the boundary
map∂1:C1(Y;k)→C0(Y;k) equals the kernel of the augmentation map ǫ:C0(Y;k)∋/summationtext
σ∈S0(Y)rσ·σ/maps⊔o→/summationtext
σ∈S0(Y)rσ∈k.
Therefore we obtain ( γi−1)v= 0 since λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1, and moreover obtain ∂1◦f1(σ1) =
f0◦∂1(σ1) = 0. This implies that
0 =∂1(/tildewidestγ−1
i⊗λv+/tildewideγi⊗(γi·v)) =∂1(/tildewidestγ−1
i⊗λv+/tildewideγi⊗v)
=∂1(−/tildewideγi⊗λv+/tildewideγi⊗v) =∂1(/tildewideγi⊗(1−λ)v)
which shows (1−λ)v= 0 since we can use Lemma 2.12 by the condition ( γi−1)v= 0.
Therefore we obtain v= 0 as desired.
Combining this proposition with the decomposition (7), we conclude th at a base of
H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))) is given by Pochhammer cycles.
Theorem 2.18. LetVbe a left k[Fn⋊αG]-module. Let us take λ∈k×\{1}. Since we
haveιa0(Cλ(V)) =V⊗kKλ∼=Vas vector spaces, we identify ιa0(Cλ(V))withV. Then
Poch: V⊕n−→H1(C\Qn(a0);ιa0(Cλ(V)))
(v1,...,v n)/maps⊔o−→/summationtextn
i=1/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗vi
is an isomorphism of vector spaces.
2.3.3 K¨ unneth formula
Let us considerEλ(k[Fn]) =H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn]))). Then since ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn])) =
k[Fn]⊗kKλhas the natural k[Fn]-bimodule structure, Cm(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn]))) =
Cm(C\Qn(a0);k)⊗k[π1(C\Qn(a0),d)]ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn])) can be naturally regarded as right k[Fn]-
modules and also the homology groups Hm(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn]))) have the induced
rightk[Fn]-module structures.
Then Theorem 2.18 implies that the ﬁrst homology H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn]))) is
free as the right k[Fn]-module and we obtain the following K¨ unneth formula.
Proposition 2.19. LetVbe ak[Fn⋊αG]-module. Let us take λ∈k×\{1}. Then there
exists an isomorphism
H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn])))⊗k[Fn]V∼− →H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))).
24Proof.Theorem 2.18 shows that H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn]))) is the free right k[Fn]-
module generated by /tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗1fori= 1,...,n, where1∈ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn])) =k[Fn]⊗kKλ
is 1⊗1 with 1∈k[Fn] and 1∈k=Kλ.
Therefore every element in H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn])))⊗k[Fn]Vis uniquely written
in the form/summationtextn
i=1(/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗1)⊗viwithvi∈V, and then we can deﬁne the map
H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn])))⊗k[Fn]V−→H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
/summationtextn
i=1(/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗1)⊗vi/maps⊔o−→/summationtextn
i=1/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗(vi⊗1)
which is an isomorphism by Theorem 2.18.
2.3.4 Euler transform and twisted Long-Moody functor
We give an equivalence of functors between the Euler transform fu nctor and twisted
Long-Moody functor.
Proposition 2.20. Let us take λ∈k×\{1}. Then the map
Φ:H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn])))−→ IFn,λ/summationtextn
i=1(/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗(x(i)⊗κ(i)))/maps⊔o−→/summationtextn
i=1(xi−1)(κ(i)x(i))
is a left k[Fn⋊θArtinBn]-module isomorphism. Where x(i)∈k[Fn]andκ(i)∈k=Kλ.
Moreover this is a right k[Fn]-module isomorphism.
Proof.Theorem 2.18 shows that Φ is a right k[Fn]-module isomomorphism. Thus it
suﬃces to show the Φ is a left k[Fn⋊θArtinBn]-module homomorphism.
Let us notice that for χ∈ιa0(Cλ(k[Fn])) we have
/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗χ=/tildewidestγ−1

/tildewideγi⊗˜η(σj)((1−λ)(γi·χ)) otherwise ,
forj= 1,...,n−1.
Let us look at the case j=i. Then we have
/tildewideγ0⊗˜η(σi)·(λ(γi−1)·χ)+/tildewidestγi+1⊗˜η(σi)((1−λ)(γi·χ))
=/tildewideγ0⊗λ(γi+1−1)·˜η(σi)(χ)+/tildewidestγi+1⊗(1−λ)γi+1·˜η(σi)(χ)
=/tildewider[γ0,γi+1]⊗˜η(σi)(χ).
25Also look at the case j=i+1. Similarly we have
/tildewideγ0⊗˜η(σj)(λ(γi−1)·χ)+/tildewider(γ−1
i+1·γi·γi+1)⊗˜η(σi+1)((1−λ)(γi·χ))
=···
=/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗˜η(σi)(γi·χ)+/tildewider[γ0,γi+1]⊗˜η(σi)((1−γi+1)·χ).
Therefore if we write the associated group homomorphism with the le ftk[Fn⋊θArtinBn]-
moduleEλ(V) byρEuler
λ:Fn⋊θArtinBn→Autk(Eλ(V)), we obtain the following matrix
representations under the identiﬁcation H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn])))∼=k[Fn]⊕nby the
isomorphism Poch,

fori= 1,...,n−1. Here we notice that through the isomorphism φ:ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn])) =
k[Fn]⊗kKλ∋x⊗κ/maps⊔o→κx∈k[Fn], we have
φ(˜η(b)(χ)) =b·φ(χ) for b∈Bn,
φ(˜η(x)(χ)) =φ(χ) for x∈Fn,
φ(γi·χ) =xi·φ(χ) for xi∈Fn, i= 1,...,n,
φ(γ0·χ) =λ·φ(χ).
Since the above matrices are same as for the Long-Moody functor , it follows that
Φ:H1(C\Qn(a0);ιa0(Cλ(k[Fn])))→IFn,λis a leftk[Bn]-module isomorphism.
Let us check that Φ is a left k[Fn]-isomorphism as well. Recalling that x1=σ2
0, we
have
x1·(/tildewider[γ0,γ1]⊗v)
=σ2
0·(/tildewideγ0⊗λ(γ1−1)·v+/tildewideγ1⊗(1−λ)(γ1·v))

where we note that ˜ η(σ2
0)(w) = ˜η(x1)(w) =wfor anyw∈¯V. Similarly we also have
x1·(/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗v) =/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗v+/tildewider[γ0,γ1]⊗(γi−1)·v
26fori= 2,...,n. Therefore we obtain the matrix representation,
ρEuler
λ(x1) =
λx1(x2−1)···(xn−1)

and this matrix form tells us that

fori= 3,...,n. These matrices are exactly the same ones in Remark 1.5 and theref ore
we obtain that Φ is a k[Fn]-module isomorphism.
Theorem 2.21. Let us take λ∈k×\{1}. Then the isomorphism
Φ:H1(C\Qn(a0);ιa0(Cλ(k[Fn])))−→IFn,λ
in Proposition 2.20 induces an isomorphism of functors
/tildewideΦ:Eλ−→LM λ.
Proof.For each V∈O(Modk[Fn⋊αG]), the isomorphism Φ and the K¨ unneth formula in
Proposition 2.19 give the desired isomorphism
Eλ(V) =H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
∼=H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(k[Fn])))⊗k[Fn]V∼=IFn,λ⊗k[Fn]V=LMλ(V).
3 Katz-Long-Moody functor
As it is easily seen, LMλ(V) or equivalently Eλ(V) contain some trivial submodules.
Hence Long and Moody, and also Katz considered reduction proced ures to eliminate these
27trivial submodules. We shall explain these reduction procedures de ﬁne a new endfunctor
ofModk[Fn⋊G].
We ﬁrst recall the reduced Long-Moody functor deﬁned in [18]. For a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-
moduleV, we consider the subspace of LM(V) as a vector space deﬁned by
V[∞]:={(x1x2···xn−1)⊗v∈IFn⊗k[Fn]V|v∈V}.
Recalling that we have α(g)(x1···xn) =x1···xnfor anyg∈Gsinceαis an Artin
representation, we see that V[∞]is a subspace as a k[G]-module as well. Then the reduced
Long-Moody functor LMred:Modk[Fn⋊αG]→Modk[G]is deﬁned by
LMred(V) :=/parenleftbig
IFn⊗k[Fn]V/parenrightbig
/V[∞].
However V[∞]isnotpreserved bythe λ-twistedactionof Fn, i.e.,V[∞]isnotasubspace
ofLMλ(V) =IFn,λ⊗k[Fn]Vas a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module, in general. Thus to consider an
analogue of the reduce Long-Moody functor for the twisted case , we need to ﬁnd some
other subspaces.
Let us consider the Fn-invariant subspace LMλ(V)FnofLMλ(V). Obviously the
subspaceLMλ(V)Fnis ak[Fn⋊αG]-submodule ofLMλ(V). Moreover this submodule
has the following description when λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1.
Proposition 3.1 (Dettweiler-Reiter, Lemma 2.7 in [6]) .Suppose that λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1. Then we
have
LMλ(V)Fn={(x1x2···xn−1)⊗v∈IFn⊗k[Fn]V|(λx1x2···xn)·v=v}.
Proof.Directly follows from Lemmas 2.4 and 2.7 in [6].
It follows from this proposition that the Fn-invariant subspace LMλ(V)Fnis a sub-
space ofV[∞]whenλ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1.
Further we consider the following subspaces
LMλ(V)[i]:=/braceleftigg
w∈LM λ(V)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglexj·w=/braceleftigg
λwifj=i
wotherwise/bracerightigg
fori= 1,...,n. Then we can see that the sum/summationtextn
i=1LMλ(V)[i]becomes a k[Fn⋊αG]-
submodule, as follows.
Lemma 3.2. The sum/summationtextn
i=1LMλ(V)[i]is closed under the G-action onLMλ(V).
Proof.Let us take w∈LM λ(V)[i]andg∈G. Then since α(g)∈Bn, there exists an
elementsg∈Snin the symmetric group of degree nsuch that α(g−1)(xj) are conjugate
toxsg(j)inFnfor allj= 1,...,n. Namely, for each j= 1,...,n, there exists x[g,j]∈Fn
such that α(g−1)(xj) =g−1xjg=x[g,j]xsg(j)(x[g,j])−1. Then we have
xj(gw) =g(g−1xjg)w
=g(x[g,j]xsg(j)(x[g,j])−1)w
=g(xsg(j)w)
=/braceleftigg
λgwifsg(j) =i
gwotherwise.
The third equation follows form the fact that every element of Fnacts onLMλ(V)[i]as
a scalar multiple. This shows that gw∈LM λ(V)[s−1
g(i)]and therefore/summationtextn
i=1LMλ(V)[i]is
closed under the G-action.
28Wenotethatif λ= 1,thenLMλ(V)[i]=/summationtextn
i=1LMλ(V)[i]=LMλ(V)Fn. Ontheother
hand, when λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1, the sum/summationtextn
i=1LMλ(V)[i]becomes the direct sum/circleplustextn
i=1LMλ(V)[i]and
each direct summand LMλ(V)[i]has the following description.
Proposition 3.3. We have inclusions
LMλ(V)[i]⊃{(xi−1)⊗v∈IFn,λ⊗k[Fn]V|v∈Vxi}
fori= 1,...,n. Here we set Vx:={v∈V|xv=v}forx∈Fn. Especially when λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1,
these inclusions are equations.
Proof.The inclusion⊃is obvious. Thus assuming λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1, we show the converse inclusion.
Let us take v∈LM λ(V)[i]. According to the identiﬁcation IFn,λ⊗k[Fn]V∼=/circleplustextn
i=1Vby
(1), we can write v= (v1,...,v n), and we shall show that vi∈Vxiandvj= 0 forj/\e}a⊔io\slash=i.
Sincev∈LM λ(V)[i], we have
/summationdisplay
l<jλ(xl−1)vl+(λxj−1)vj+/summationdisplay
l>j(xl−1)vl=/braceleftigg
(λ−1)viifj=i
0 otherwise.(8)
From these equations, we obtain
vl−xl+1vl+1= 0 for l/\e}a⊔io\slash=i−1,i,
vi−1−(xi−1)vi= 0,
xi+1vi+1= 0.(9)
The ﬁrst and third equations show vl= 0 forl≥i+1.Then ifi= 1, we obtain x1v1=v1
andvj= 0,j/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0 as desired. We assume that i >1. Let us look at the equations l= 1
andl=iin (8) and then we obtain the equations
(λx1−1)v1+(x2−1)v2+···+(xi−1)vi= 0
λ(x1−1)v1+λ(x2−1)v2+···+λ(xi−1)vi= 0,
which deduce x1v1= 0, i.e., v1= 0. Thus the ﬁrst equation in (9) shows v1=···=
vi−1= 0. Thus we obtain xivi=vi.
As an analogue of the middle convolution functor deﬁned by Dettweile r-Reiter in [6]
and also by V¨ olklein in [25], we consider the following endfunctor of Modk[Fn⋊αG].
Deﬁnition 3.4 (Katz-Long-Moody functor) .Let us take λ∈k×. The functor
KLM λ:Modk[Fn⋊αG]→Modk[Fn⋊αG]
deﬁned by
KLM λ(V) :=LMλ(V)//parenleftiggn/summationdisplay
i=1LMλ(V)[i]+LMλ(V)Fn/parenrightigg
is called the reduced twisted Long-Moody functor orKatz-Long-Moody functor associated
withλ. Sometimes we call this functor the KLM-functor in short.
We write the quotient map by
θλ
V:LMλ(V)−→KLM λ(V),
which gives a natural transformation between the functors LMλandKLM λ.
29Especially for λ= 1, the KLM-functor arises also from the multiplication map as
follows. Let us suppose λ= 1. Then the multiplication map ∇:IFn,1⊗k[Fn]V→V
becomes a k[Fn⋊αG]-module homomorphism. Therefore the sequence
0→Ker∇→IFn,1⊗k[Fn]V∇− →V→Coker∇→0
is an exact sequence of k[Fn⋊αG]-modules.
On the other hand, we have/summationtextn
i=1LM1(V)[i]+LM1(V)Fn=LM1(V)Fnwhenλ= 1.
Also Remark 1.5 shows that v∈LM 1(V)Fnif and only if/summationtextn
i=1(xi−1)vi= 0 where we
writev= (v1,...,v n)∈V⊕nthrough the isomorphism (1). Therefore we have
Kerθ1
V=LM1(V)Fn=/braceleftigg
(v1,...,v n)∈V⊕n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/summationdisplay
i=1(xi−1)vi= 0/bracerightigg
= Ker∇
by Proposition 1.10. Thus we obtain the following.
Proposition 3.5. LetVbe a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module. Let us consider the multiplication
map∇:IFn,1⊗k[Fn]V→Vas ak[Fn⋊αG]-module homomorphism. Then we have
KLM 1(V)∼=Coimθ1
V= Coim∇∼=Im∇⊂V.
In particular when Coker∇={0}, we have
KLM 1(V)∼=V.
The KLM-functor is not exact. However the following holds.
Proposition 3.6 (cf. Lemma 2.8 in [6] and Section 2.1 in [25]) .Let us consider a
leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module homomorphism φ:V→W. Then the induced homomorphism
KLM λ(φ):KLM λ(V)→KLM λ(W)is injective (resp. surjective) if φis injective (resp.
surjective).
Proof.Let us note that we have the following commutative diagram,
0 Ker θλ
VLMλ(V)KLM λ(V) 0
0 Ker θλ
WLMλ(W)KLM λ(W) 0LMλ(φ)|Kerθλ
VLMλ(φ) KLMλ(φ),
where the horizontal sequences are exact.
Suppose that φis injective. Since LMλis an exact functor, LMλ(φ) is injective.
Moreover we have
ImLMλ(φ)|Kerθλ
V= ImLMλ(φ)∩Kerθλ
W
by Lemma 2.8 in [6]. Thus a diagram chasing shows that KLM λ(φ) is injective.
Next we suppose that φis surjective. Then LMλ(φ) is surjective from the exactness
ofLMλ. Therefore the above diagram directly shows KLM λ(φ) is surjective.
4 Middle convolution and Katz-Long-Moody functor
In the book [14], Katz introduced the notion of middle convolution fun ctor by means of
the middle extension operation for perverse sheaves, and this midd le convolution func-
tor is acknowledged widely as a sophisticated generalization of the Eu ler transform. In
this section we shall give an interpretation of Katz’ middle convolutio n by the twisted
homology theory and show that this homological middle convolution is e quivalent to the
KLM-functor.
304.1 Homological middle convolution
We use the same notations as in Section 2. Let us write the Riemann sp here byP1:=
C⊔{∞}. According to the identity C\Qn(a0) =P1\Q∞
n(a0) by setting Q∞
n:=Qn⊔{∞}
andQ∞
n(a0) :=Q∞
n⊔{a0}, we rewrite H1(C\Qn(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))) as the homology group
onP1\Q∞
n(a0),H1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))).
Let us also consider the Borel-Moore homology groups HBM
∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
which are homology groups of the chain complex deﬁned by the proje ctive limit of relative
chains
CBM
∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))) := lim←−C∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\K;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
asKranges over the directed set of compact subsets of P1\Q∞
n(a0). Then the canonical
projection maps
C∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))→C∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\K;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
induce the natural maps of homology groups
H∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))→HBM
∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))).
Let us recall that the group homomorphism η:Fn⋊αG→AutTop(P1\Q∞
n(a0)) given
in Section 2.2.1. Then as well as in Section 2.2.3, this ηinduces the maps
C∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\K;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
−→C∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\η(h)(K);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
forh∈Fn⋊αG. Sinceη(h)(K) are still compact in the above maps, these maps deﬁnes
the action of Fn⋊αGon this projective system. Therefore we can regard the projec-
tive limit HBM
1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))) as ak[Fn⋊αG]-module and the canonical map
H1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))−→HBM
1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))) as a k[Fn⋊αG]-module
homomorphism.
Deﬁnition 4.1 (Homological middle convolution functor) .Forλ∈k×\{1}, we deﬁne
the functorMCλ:Modk[Fn⋊αG]→Modk[Fn⋊αG]by
MCλ(V) := Im(H1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))−→HBM
1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))))
forV∈O(Modk[Fn⋊αG]). Also for φ∈Homk[Fn⋊αG](V,W), we deﬁne
MCλ(φ)∈Homk[Fn⋊αG](MCλ(V),MCλ(W)) by the homomorphism induced by the com-
mutative diagram
H1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))) HBM
1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
H1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(W))) HBM
1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(W)))H1(φ) HBM
1(φ) ,
where the horizontal maps are the canonical maps and vertical on es are induced map by
φ. We call this functor the homological middle convolution .
31Remark 4.2. The integral representation
F(α,β,γ;z) =Γ(γ)
Γ(α)Γ(γ−α)/integraldisplay∞
1tβ−γ(t−1)γ−α−1(t−z)−βdt
of the Gauss hypergeometric function is valid only for Re( γ−α),Reα >0 which assures
the convergence of the integral. However, the hypergeometric s eries
F(α,β,γ;z) =∞/summationdisplay
n=0α(α+1)···(α+(n−1))β(β+1)···(β+(n−1))
γ(γ+1)···(γ+(n−1))n!zn
is deﬁned for α,β∈Candγ∈C\Z≤0. Therefore the integral in the right hand side in
the above equation can be analytically continued and it is well-known th at this analytic
continuation is given by the formula
/integraldisplay
[γ1,γ∞]tβ−γ(t−1)γ−α−1(t−z)−βdt
= (1−e2πiα)(1−e2πi(γ−α))/integraldisplay∞
1tβ−γ(t−1)γ−α−1(t−z)−βdt(10)
where [γ1,γ∞] is the Pochhammer contour consisting of closed paths γ1encircling 1 clock-
wise and γ∞encircling∞as well.
As we saw previously, the homology group H1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))) can be seen
as an analogue of integrations along Pochhammer contours. On the other hand, as it is
well-known, the Borel-Moore homology groups are isomorphic to the homology groups
of locally ﬁnite chains which correspond to usual path integrals conn ecting points in
Q∞
n(a0) under our setting. Namely, we can roughly say that the left hand s ide in
the equation (10) corresponds to H1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))), the domain of the map
deﬁning the homological middle convolution, and the right hand side co rresponds to
HBM
1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))), the target of the map for the middle convolution. There-
fore our deﬁnition of the middle convolution gives a homological interp retation of the
classical formula (10).
4.2 Euler transform as Borel-Moore homology
Let us write a punctured disk of radius rand centered at abyD∗
<r(a) :={z∈C|0<
|z−a|< r}ifa∈C, and by D∗
<r(∞) :={z∈C|1/r <|z|}ifa=∞. Let us take ε >0
and deﬁne
D∗
<ε(Q∞
n(a0)) :=n/unionsqdisplay
i=0D∗
<ε(ai)⊔D∗
<ε(∞).
Also deﬁne Km:= (P1\Q∞
n(a0))\D∗
<1/m(Q∞
n(a0)) form∈Z≥1which are compact subsets
ofP1\Q∞
n(a0). Then weobtaintheincreasing sequence ofcompact subsets K1⊂K2⊂···
whose union is P1\Q∞
n(a0) and the projective limit
lim←−KmH∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))).
There is the natural map
HBM
∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))−→lim←−KmH∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
32by the universality of the projective limit. Since the projective limit fu nctor is not com-
patible with the homology functor, this map may not be isomorphism in g eneral setting.
However we can show the following.
Proposition 4.3. The natural map
HBM
∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))−→lim←−KmH∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
is an isomorphism.
Proof.We omit the coeﬃcients of homology groups for simplicity. Let us take 0< ε <
ε′<1/2 and recall that D∗
<ε′(Q∞
n(a0)) is a deformation retract of D∗
<ε(Q∞
n(a0)). Then
the map
H∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km)→H∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km′)
induced by the map ( P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km)→(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km′)
is an isomorphism for every 2 < m′≤m∈Z≥1. Therefore we obtain
lim←−Km1H∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))) ={0},
where lim←−1is the ﬁrst derived functor R1lim←−of the limit functor lim←−. Then the result
follows from Theorem 7.3 in [23].
Corollary 4.4. For allm >2, projection maps
HBM
∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))−→H∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
are isomorphisms.
Proof.As we saw in the proof of the above proposition, the map
H∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km)→H∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km′)
is an isomorphism for every 2 < m′≤m. This shows that projection maps
lim←−KmH∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
→H∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km′;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
are isomorphisms for m′>2. Then the above proposition shows the result.
4.3 Equivalence between homological middle convolution an d
Katz-Long-Moody functor
Now we recall that
H∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),(P1\Q∞
n(a0))\Km;ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
=H∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),D∗
<1/m(Q∞
n(a0));ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))).
Then the kernel of the map
H1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))−→HBM
1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))
in Deﬁnition 4.1 is computable by the long exact sequence of the relativ e homology
H∗(P1\Q∞
n(a0),D∗
<1/m(Q∞
n(a0));ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))) as follows.
33Proposition 4.5. Let us take m∈Z>2. Then we have the equation
Ker(H1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))−→HBM
1(P1\Q∞

We also recall the commutative diagram

whose vertical map is isomorphism by Corollary 4.4. Then we obtain the result.
Theorem 4.6. Let us take λ∈k×\{1}. The isomorphism /tildewideΦ:Eλ→LM λinduces an
isomorphism
/hatwideΦ:MCλ→KLM λ.
Proof.Let us take a left k[Fn⋊αG]-module Vand a ﬁxed m∈Z>2. Proposition 4.5 tells
us that the kernel of the projection map Θλ
V:Eλ(V)→MC λ(V) equals to
Im(H1(P1\Q∞
n(a0),D∗
<1/m(Q∞
n(a0));ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))→H1(P1\Q∞
n(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))).
Now we claim that
Im(H1(D∗

<1/m(ai))→H1(P1\Q∞

a0(Cλ(V)))|v∈(ι∗
a0(Cλ(V)))γ∞}
whereγ∞is the homotopy class of the path homotopic to ( γ0···γn)−1.
Let us suppose the claim is true. Since D∗
<1/m(Q∞
n(a0)) is the disjoint union of
D∗
<1/m(ai),i= 0,...,n, andD∗
<1/m(∞), we have
H1(D∗

Let us note that H1(D∗
<1/m(a0);ι∗
a0(Cλ(V))|D∗
<1/m(a0)) ={0}because of λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1. Also
note that the isomorphism ι∗

Therefore there uniquely exists the homomorphism /hatwideΦV:MCλ(V)→KLM λ(V) such
that the diagram

morphisms of the diagram are isomorphisms.
Then it remains to prove the claim. Since D∗
<1/m(ai),i= 1,...,n, andD∗
<1/m(∞) are
homotopy equivalent to S1, Lemma 2.12 shows that
Im(H1(D∗

As in the ﬁrst part in the proof of Proposition 2.20, we have
/tildewider[γ0,γi]⊗v=/tildewideγ0⊗λ(γi−1)·v+/tildewideγi⊗(1−λ)(γi·v)

/tildewider[γ0,γ∞]⊗v=/tildewiderγ∞⊗(1−λ)v
forv∈(ι∗

5 Subcategory ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG]
In [14], Katz introduced certain conditions called the property ℘which assures that the
middle convolution functor behaves well. As an analogue of these con ditions, Dettweiler-
Reiter [6] andV¨ olklein [25] deﬁned a full subcategory of Modk[Fn], andshowed many good
properties of the middle convolution functor inside this subcategor y. In this section, we
shall extend thissubcategory toa full subcategoryof Modk[Fn⋊αG], andshow fundamental
properties of the Katz-Long-Moody functor on this subcategor y.
355.1 Deﬁnition of ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG]
Let us consider the projection map from Fnto the inﬁnite cyclic group F1=/a\}b∇acke⊔le{⊔x/a\}b∇acke⊔∇i}h⊔deﬁned
by
pi:Fn−→ F1
xj/maps⊔o−→pi(xj) :=/braceleftigg
xifj=i
1 otherwise,
which extends to the group homomorphism.
Deﬁnition 5.1 (almost trival module, V¨ olklein [25]) .We say that a left k[Fn]-module V
isalmost trivial if there exists a 1-dimensional k[F1]-module KandVis isomorphic to
p∗
i(K) for some i= 1,...,n.
For a left R-module Mand ring homomorphism φ:P→R,φ∗(M) denotes the pull-
back module of M. Namely, φ∗(M) =Mas Abel groups and the P-module structure is
deﬁne by p·m:=φ(p)·mforp∈Pandm∈M.
Deﬁnition 5.2 (cf. Katz, Lemma 2.6.14 and Corollay 2.6.15 in [14]; V¨ olklein, Section
2.2 in [25]; Dettweiler-Reiter, Section 3 in [6]) .We say that a left k[Fn]-module Vsatisﬁes
the property ( P1) if
Homk[Fn](T,V) ={0}
for all almost trivial modules T. Similarly we say that a left k[Fn]-module Vsatisﬁes the
property ( P2) if
Homk[Fn](V,T) ={0}
for all almost trivial modules T.
LetModNT
k[Fn⋊αG]be the full subcategory of Modk[Fn⋊αG]whose object consists of
k[Fn⋊αG]-module Vsatisfying both of ( P1) and (P2) when we regard Vas ak[Fn]-
module through the inclusion k[Fn]֒→k[Fn⋊αG].
Remark 5.3. LetVbe a left k[Fn]-module and ρV:Fn→Autk(V) the induced group
homomorphism. Then the property ( P1) is equivalent to that
(Ker(ρV(xi)−τ))∩/intersectiondisplay
j/\egatio\slash=iKer(ρV(xj)−1) ={0} (11)
for alli= 1,...,nandτ∈k×. Similarly, the property ( P2) is equivalent to that
(Im(ρV(xi)−τ))+/summationdisplay
j/\egatio\slash=iIm(ρV(xj)−1) =V (12)
for alli= 1,...,nandτ∈k×.
5.2 Katz-Long-Moody functor in ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG]
The following proposition assures that the full subcategory ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG]is preserved by
the Katz-Long-Moody functor.
Proposition 5.4 (cf. Corollary 6.2.7 in [14], Lemma 2.2 in [25], and Proposition 3.4 in
[6]).LetVbe a left k[Fn⋊αG]-module and λ∈k×. IfVhas the property (P1), then so
doesKLM(V). Similarly, if Vhas the property (P2), then so doesKLM(V).
36Proof.First we suppose λ= 1. If Hom k[Fn](T,V) ={0}for an almost trivial module T,
then we have Hom k[Fn](T,KLM 1(V)) ={0}sinceKLM 1(V) is isomorphic to a submod-
ule ofVby Proposition 3.5. Meanwhile, if Hom k[Fn](V,T) ={0}for any almost trivial
modules T, then Propositions 1.10 and 3.5 show that KLM 1(V)∼=V. Thus we have
Homk[Fn](KLM 1(V),T) ={0}for any almost trivial modules T
Next we suppose λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1. We shall only show that if Vhas the property ( P1), then
KLM λ(V) has the property ( P1). The dual argument shows the property ( P2) is pre-
served by the KLM-functor.
We identifyLMλ(V) withV⊕nby the isomorphism (1). Let ρLM
λ:Fn⋊αG→
Autk(V⊕n) be the associated group homomorphism with LMλ(V). Then to show the
condition (11) holds for KLM λ(V), it suﬃces to see that the following claim holds for
everyi= 1,...,nandτ∈k×. Namely, if v∈LM λ(V) satisﬁes
(ρLM
λ(xi)−τ)v∈Kerθλ
V,(ρLM
λ(xj)−1)v∈Kerθλ
V,
forj∈{1,...,n}\{i}, thenv∈Kerθλ
V.This claim follows from the lemmas below.
Before showing the claim in the above proposition, we prepare a lemma .
Lemma 5.5. LetVbe a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module and λ∈k×\{1}. Ifv∈LM λ(V)satisﬁes
that(x−1)v∈/circleplustextn
i=1LMλ(V)[i]for allx∈Fn, thenv∈Kerθλ
V.
Proof.By the assumption, we have ( xi−1)v∈/circleplustextn
j=1LMλ(V)[j]for alli= 1,...,n.
Since (xi−1)v∈(xi−1)⊗Vand ((xi−1)⊗V)∩/circleplustextn
j=1LMλ(V)[j]=LMλ(V)[i], we
have (xi−1)v∈LM λ(V)[i]. Setwi:= (xi−1)v,i= 1,...,nandw:=/summationtextn
i=1wi. Then
w∈/circleplustextn
j=1LMλ(V)[j]and moreover we have ( xi−1)w=/summationtextn
j=1(xj−1)wj= (xi−1)wi=
(λ−1)wisincewj∈LM λ(V)[j]. Therefore we obtain
(xi−1)(v−(λ−1)−1w) =wi−(λ−1)−1(λ−1)wi= 0 for all i= 1,...,n,
which shows that v= (λ−1)−1w+(v−(λ−1)−1w)∈/circleplustextn
j=1LMλ(V)[j]+LMλ(V)Fn=
Kerθλ
V.
Now we give a proof of the above claim
Lemma 5.6. LetVbe a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module satisfying (P1). Let us take λ∈k×\{1}.
Let us take v∈LM λ(V),τ∈k×, andi∈{1,...,n}arbitrarily. Then if it is satisﬁed
that
(ρLM
λ(xi)−τ)v∈Kerθλ
V,(ρLM
λ(xj)−1)v∈Kerθλ
V, (13)
forj∈{1,...,n}\{i}, thenv∈Kerθλ
V.
Proof.Now we claim that ( ρLM
λ(xj)−1)v∈Kerθλ
Vis equivalent to ( ρLM
λ(xj)−1)v∈
LMλ(V)[j]. Since (ρLM
λ(xj)−1)v∈(xj−1)⊗V, this claim follows from the equation
((xj−1)⊗V)∩Kerθλ
V=LMλ(V)[j](14)
whichholdsunder thecondition(11). Theinclusion ⊃obviously holdsbydeﬁnitions with-
out the condition (11). Let us show the inclusion ⊂. Take (xj−1)⊗vj∈((xj−1)⊗V)∩
Kerθλ
V. Then we can write ( xj−1)⊗vj=/summationtextn
l=1(xl−1)⊗(kl+(xl−1···xn)·u) with some
kl∈Vxlandu∈Vλx1···xnby Propositions 3.1 and 3.3. Then we have kl+(xl−1···xn)·u=
0 forl/\e}a⊔io\slash=j, i.e., (xl−1···xn)·u∈Vxlforl/\e}a⊔io\slash=j. This shows that u∈Vxl= Ker(ρV(xl)−1)
37forl/\e}a⊔io\slash=jandu∈Vλxj= Ker(ρV(xj)−λ−1). Then the condition (11) for Vimplies that
u= 0, which shows the inclusion (( xj−1)⊗V)∩Kerθλ
V⊂LM λ(V)[j]. Thus we obtain
the equation (14).
Let us suppose that the condition (13) holds for τ= 1, i.e., we have ( ρLM
λ(x)−1)v∈θλ
V
for allx∈Fn. Then the above claim implies that ( ρLM
λ(x)−1)v∈/circleplustextn
i=1LMλ(V)[i]and
Lemma 5.5 shows that v∈Kerθλ
Vas desired.
Next we suppose that thecondition (13) holds for τ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1. Then the above claim implies
that for j/\e}a⊔io\slash=i, there exists kj∈LM λ(V)[j]such that ( ρLM
λ(xj)−1)v= (xj−1)⊗kj.
Let us write v= (v1,...,v n)∈V⊕nunder the identiﬁcation LMλ(V)∼=V⊕nby the
isomorphism (1). Also we write ( ρLM
λ(xi)−τ)v=v(0)+v(∞)byv(0)= (v(0)
1,...,v(0)
n)∈/circleplustextn
l=1LMλ(V)[l],v(∞)= (v(∞)
1,...,v(∞)
n)∈LM λ(V)Fn. Then these equations induces
the following equations.
/summationdisplay
l<iλ(xl−1)vl+(λxi−τ)vi+/summationdisplay
l>iλ(xl−1)vl=v(0)

/summationdisplay
l<jλ(xl−1)vl+(λxj−1)vi+/summationdisplay
l>kλ(xl−1)vl=kj forj/\e}a⊔io\slash=i(17)
Substituting the equations (16) to (15) and (17), we moreover ha ve the following.
(λxi−τ)ui+(1−τ)−1(v(∞)
i−1−λv(∞)
i) =v(0)
i+v(∞)

(xi−1)ui+(1−τ)−1(v(∞)
i−1−v(∞)
i) =kj+(1−λ)(1−τ)−1v(0)
jforj > i(18)
Here we use the fact that v(0)
l∈Vxlandxl·v(∞)
l=v(∞)
l−1, and we formally put v(0)
0=
λ−1v(∞)
n. Sincekj,v(0)
j∈Vxj, the equations (18) induces
(xi−1)ui+(1−τ)−1(v(∞)
i−1−v(∞)
i) = (τ

and moreover the equation (19) shows that ( xi−1)ui+ (1−τ)−1(v(∞)

Thus the condition (11) for Vimplies that
(xi−1)ui+(1−τ)−1(v(∞)

j/\egatio\slash=iVxj={0},
namely, we have
(xi−1)(vi−(1−τ)−1v(∞)
i) = (xi−1)ui+(1−τ)−1(v(∞)
i−1−v(∞)
i) = 0.(21)
Finally recalling that we have vj−(1−τ)−1v(∞)
j= (1−τ)−1v(0)
j∈Vxjforj/\e}a⊔io\slash=iby
(16) and vi−(1−τ)−1v(∞)
i∈Vxiby (21), we conclude that
v= (v−(1−τ)−1v(∞))+(1−τ)−1v(∞)∈n/circleplusdisplay
l=1LMλ(V)[l]⊕LM λ(V)Fn= Kerθλ

as desired.
38The following fundamental theorem shows that the Katz-Long-Mo ody functor gives a
nontrivial auto-equivalence of category ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG]. This is a natural generalization of
Theorem 2.9.7 in [14], Theorem 2.4 in [25], and Theorem 3.5 in [6].
Theorem 5.7. Let us take λ,τ∈k×. Then we have the following.
1. As endfunctors of ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG],KLM λ◦KLM τandKLM λτare isomorphic.
2. The functorKLM λis an auto-equivalence of the category ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG]. In partic-
ular,KLM λ−1is an inverse functor.
The second assertion follows fromthe ﬁrst one whose proof is given inthe next section.
As well as the the Katz algorithm for local systems on C\{n-points}, we also have
another operation called the multiplication , which is deﬁned by
Mulχ:Modk[Fn⋊αG]∋V/maps⊔o−→χ⊗CV∈Modk[Fn⋊αG]
for an arbitrarily 1-dimensional module χ∈Modk[Fn⋊αG]. Applying these KLM-functors
and multiplication functors repeatedly, we can construct families of inﬁnitely many non-
isomorphic k[Fn⋊αG]-modules.
5.3 A proof of Theorem 5.7
This section is dedicated to a proof of the ﬁrst assertion of Theore m 5.7.
Lemma 5.8. LetVbe a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module satisfying (P1). Let us take λ∈k×\{1}.
Ifv∈Vsatisﬁes that
(x1···xn−1)⊗v∈n/circleplusdisplay
i=1LMλ(V)[i],
thenv= 0.
Proof.Under the isomorphism (1), we can write
(x1···xn−1)⊗v= ((x2···xn)·v,(x3···xn)·v,...,v)∈V⊕n.
Then since v∈/circleplustextn
i=1LMλ(V)[i], we obtain that
xn·v=v, xn−1xn·v=xn−1v=v, ... ,(x2···xn)·v=v,
i.e., (x1···xn−1)⊗v= (v,...,v). Then it follows that v∈/intersectiontextn
i=1Ker(xi−1) ={0}, i.e.,
v= 0.
Lemma 5.9. LetVbe a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module satisfying (P1). Let us take λ,τ∈k×\{1}.
Let us consider the commutative diagram of k[Fn⋊αG]-modules,
0 Ker θλ
LMλ(V)LMλ◦LM τ(V)KLM λ◦LM τ(V) 0
0 Ker θλ
KLM λ(V)LMλ◦KLM τ(V)KLM λ◦KLM τ(V) 0LMλ(θτ

LMτ(V)
LMλ(θτ

θλ
KLMτ(V)
whose horizontal sequences are exact. Then the left vertica l map
LMλ(θτ
V): Kerθλ
LMτ(V)−→Kerθλ
KLM τ(V)
is surjective.
39Proof.First we claim that
θτ
V:LMτ(V)xi−→KLM τ(V)xi
is surjective for any i= 1,...,n.Sinceθτ
V:LMτ(V)→KLM τ(V) is surjective, there
exists ¯w∈LM τ(V) such that θτ
V(¯w) =wfor anyw∈KLM τ(V)xi. Then it follows that
0 = (xi−1)w=θτ
V((xi−1)¯w), i.e., (xi−1)¯w∈Kerθτ
V. We apply the equation (14)
in Lemma 5.6 and obtain ( xi−1)¯w∈LM τ(V)[i]. Therefore putting ˜ w:= (xi−1)¯w∈
LMτ(V)[i], we obtain
(xi−1)(¯w−(τ−1)−1˜w) = ˜w−(τ−1)−1(τ−1)˜w= 0.
Namely, ˆ w:= (¯w−(τ−1)−1˜w)∈LM τ(V)xi. Since ˜w∈LM τ(V)[i]⊂Kerθτ
V, we have
θτ
V(ˆw) =θτ
V(¯w) =w, which shows the claim.
Recalling that
LMλ(LMτ(V))[i]={(xi−1)⊗w|w∈LM τ(V)xi},
LMλ(KLM τ(V))[i]={(xi−1)⊗w|w∈KLM τ(V)xi},
i= 1,...,n, andLMλ(θτ
V) = id IFn,λ⊗θτ
V, we can conclude that
LMλ(θτ
V):n/circleplusdisplay
i=1LMλ(LMτ(V))[i]−→n/circleplusdisplay
i=1LMλ(KLM τ(V))[i]
is surjective by the above claim.
Next we claim that
θτ
V:LMτ(V)λx1···xn−→KLM τ(V)λx1···xn
is surjective. As well as the above claim, there exists ¯ w∈LM τ(V) such that θτ
V(¯w) =w
for anyw∈KLM τ(V)λx1···xn. Then it follows that ( λx1···xn−1)¯w∈Kerθτ
V. Let
us consider the case λτ= 1. In this case, the matrix representation of x1···xn−τ=
x1···xn−λ−1in Remark 1.5 shows that ( λx1···xn−1)¯w∈(x1···xn−1)⊗V. Thus
since (λx1···xn−1)¯w∈Kerθτ
V=/circleplustextn
i=1LMτ(V)[i]⊕LM τ(V)Fn, Lemma 5.8 implies
that (λx1···xn−1)¯w∈LM τ(V)Fn. Put ˜w:= (λx1···xn−1)¯w. Then we obtain
(λx1···xn−1)(¯w−(λ−1)−1˜w) = ˜w−(λ−1)−1(λ−1)˜w= 0.
Thus ¯w−(λ−1)−1˜w∈LM τ(V)λx1···xnandθτ
V(¯w−(λ−1)−1˜w) =θτ
V(¯w) =was desired.
Alsowe consider thecase λτ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1. Inthiscase, wecanwrite( λx1···xn−1)¯w=w(0)+w(∞)
byw(0)∈/circleplustextn
i=1LMτ(V)[i]andw(∞)∈LM τ(V)Fn. Then we obtain
(λx1···xn−1)(¯w−(λτ−1)−1w(0)−(λ−1)−1w(∞)) =
w(0)+w(∞)−(λτ−1)−1(λτ−1)w(0)−(λ−1)−1(λ−1)w(∞)= 0.
Thus ¯w−(λτ−1)−1w(0)−(λ−1)−1w(∞)∈LM τ(V)λx1···xnandθτ
V(¯w−(λτ−1)−1w(0)−
(λ−1)−1w(∞)) =θτ
V(¯w) =w. Therefore in any cases we obtain the claim.
This claim assures that
LMλ(θτ
V):LMλ(LMτ(V))Fn−→LM λ(KLM τ(V))Fn
is surjective as above.
Therefore we conclude that
LMλ(θτ
V): Kerθλ
LMτ(V)−→Kerθλ
KLM τ(V)
is surjective.
40Lemma 5.10. LetVbe a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module satisfying (P2). Let us take λ,τ∈k×.
Then the multiplication map
∇:LMλ(LMτ(V))−→LM λτ(V)
is surjective. Moreover if λ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1, we obtain the short exact sequence
0→n/circleplusdisplay
i=1LMλ(LMτ(V))[i]→LM λ(LMτ(V))∇− →LM λτ(V)→0.
Proof.Let us write V⊕nbyWfor simplicity and we regard LMλ(LMτ(V)) asW⊕nand
alsoLMλτ(V) asWby the isomorphism (1). Then the multiplication map is written in
the following form,
∇:W⊕n−→ W
(w1,...,w n)/maps⊔o−→/summationtextn
i=1(ρLM
τ(xi)−1)wi.
For (w1,...,w n)∈W⊕n, we write wi= (v(i)
1,...,v(i)
n)∈V⊕n=W. Then the matrix
representation of ρLM
τ(x) in Remark 1.5 tells us that
n/summationdisplay
i=1(ρLM
τ(xi)−1)wi=/parenleftbig
(τx1−1)v(1)
1+(x2−1)v(1)
2+···(xn−1)v(1)

τ(x1−1)v(2)

2+···(xn−1)v(2)
n,
···,
τ(x1−1)v(n)
1+τ(x2−1)v(n)
2+···(τxn−1)v(n)
n/parenrightbig
.
Therefore the property ( P2) implies that∇is surjective.
The second assertion follows from Propositions 1.10 and 3.3.
Lemma 5.11. LetVbe a left k[Fn⋊αG]-module. Let us take λ,τ∈k×so thatλ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1.
We consider the multiplication map ∇:LMλ(LMτ(V))−→LM λτ(V).Then we have
the inclusion
∇(KerLMλ(θτ
V))⊂n/circleplusdisplay
i=1LMλτ(V)[i],
which is the equation especially when λτ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1.
Proof.Note that we have
KerLMλ(θτ
V) =LMλ(Kerθτ
V)
=n/circleplusdisplay
i=1LMλ(LMτ(V)[i])⊕LM λ(LMτ(V)Fn)
since the twisted Long-Moody functor is additive and exact. Put W:=V⊕nand regard
LMλ(LMτ(V))asW⊕nandmoreover regard LMλτ(V)asW=V⊕nbytheisomorphism
(1). Then Proposition 3.3 tells us that
n/circleplusdisplay
i=1LMλ(LMτ(V)[i]) =
{(w1,...,w n)∈W⊕n|wi= (v(i)
1,...,v(i)
n) withvj∈Ker(ρV(xj)−1), i,j= 1,...,n},
n/circleplusdisplay
i=1LMλτ(V)[i]={(v1,...,v n)∈V⊕n|vi∈Ker(ρV(xi)−1), i= 1,...,n},
41whereρV:Fn⋊αG→Autk(V) is the induced group homomorphism. Then we have that

iswell-deﬁned, and moreover surjective especially when λτ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1. Thus we obtainthe result
by Proposition 3.3.
Corollary 5.12. LetVbe a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-module. Let us take λ,τ∈k×so thatλ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1.
We consider the multiplication map
∇:LMλ(LMτ(V))−→LM λτ(V).
Then we have
∇−1(Kerθλτ
V) = Kerθλ
LMτ(V)+KerLMλ(θτ
V).
Proof.First we show that
∇−1(LMλτ(V)Fn) = Kerθλ
LMτ(V). (22)
Let us take w∈Kerθλ
LMτ(V)and write w=w(0)+w(∞)according to the decomposition
Kerθλ
LMτ(V)=/circleplustextn
i=1LMλ(LMτ(V))[i]⊕LM λ(LMτ(V))Fn. Thenrecalling thatKer ∇=/circleplustextn
i=1LMλ(LMτ(V))[i]from Lemma 5.10, we have
x∇(w) =x∇(w(∞)) =∇(xw(∞)) =∇(w(∞)) =∇(w)
for anyx∈Fn, i.e.∇(w)∈ LM λτ(V)Fn. Thus∇−1(LMλτ(V)Fn)⊃Kerθλ
LMτ(V).
Conversely take w∈∇−1(LMλτ(V)Fn). Then we have
(x−1)w∈Ker∇=n/circleplusdisplay
i=1LMλ(LMτ(V))[i],
for anyx∈Fn. Thus Lemma 5.5 shows that w∈Kerθλ
LMτ(V). Therefore we obtain the
equation (22).
Ifλτ= 1, then Ker θλτ
V=LMλτ(V)Fn. Also Lemma 5.11 tells that
∇(KerLMλ(θτ
V))⊂n/circleplusdisplay
i=1LMλτ(V)[i]⊂Kerθλτ
V.
Thus the equation (22) gives the desired equation.
Next we suppose λτ/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1 and we show
∇−1(n/circleplusdisplay
i=1LMλτ(V)[i]) = KerLMλ(θτ
V)+Ker∇. (23)
Since KerLMλ(θτ
V) =/circleplustextn
i=1LMλ(LMτ(V)[i])⊕LM λ(LMτ(V)Fn), the inclusion⊃fol-
lows fromLemma 5.11. Let us take w∈∇−1(/circleplustextn
i=1LMλτ(V)[i]). Then Lemma 5.11 again
implies that there exits ¯ w∈KerLMλ(θτ
V) such that∇(¯w) =∇(w), which implies that
w−¯w∈Ker∇, i.e.,w∈KerLMλ(θτ
V)+Ker∇. Thus we obtain the converse inclusion
⊂and therefore the equation (23).
In conclusion, equations (22) and (23) give the desired equation.
42Let us consider the unique k[Fn⋊αG]-module homomorphism
/tildewide∇:LMλ(KLM τ(V))−→KLM λτ(V)
which makes the following diagram commutative.
0LMλ(Kerθτ
V)LMλ(LMτ(V))LMλ(KLM τ(V)) 0

Corollary 5.13. LetVbe a left k[Fn⋊αG]-module satisfying (P1). Let us take λ,τ∈
k×\{1}. Then there uniquely exists the k[Fn⋊αG]-module injective homomorphism
/hatwide∇:KLM λ(KLM τ(V))−→KLM λτ(V)
which makes the diagram
LMλ(KLM τ(V))KLM λµ(V)
KLM λ(KLM τ(V))/tildewide∇
θλ
KLMτ(V)/hatwide∇
commutative.
Proof.Let recall the following commutative diagram.

By Corollary 5.12, we obtain
LMλ(θτ
V)−1(Kerθλ
KLM τ(V)) = Kerθλ
LMτ(V)+KerLMλ(θτ
V) =∇−1(Kerθλτ
V).
This equation, Lemma 5.9, and the above commutative diagram show t hat
Kerθλ
KLM τ(V)= Ker/tildewide∇. (24)
Therefore/tildewide∇factors through the map θλ
KLM τ(V), namely, there uniquely exits the injective
k[Fn⋊αG]-module homomorphism
/hatwide∇:KLM λ(KLM τ(V))−→KLM λτ(V)
43and the following diagram is commutative.
LMλ(KLM τ(V))KLM λµ(V)
KLM λ(KLM τ(V))/tildewide∇
θλ
KLMτ(V)/hatwide∇
Now we are ready for ﬁnishing the proof of Theorem 5.7. Let Vbe an object in
ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG]. Let us take λ,τ∈k×. Ifλ= 1 orτ= 1, Proposition 3.5 shows that the
multiplication map gives an isomorphism of functors KLM λ◦KLM τandKLM λτ. Thus
we may assume that λ,τ∈k×\{1}. Then Corollary 5.13 shows that the multiplication
map induces the injective k[Fn⋊G]-module homomorphism
/hatwide∇:KLM λ(KLM τ(V))−→KLM λτ(V)
andthisissurjective byLemma 5.10, namely /hatwide∇gives anisomorphism offunctors KLM λ◦
KLM τandKLM λτ.
5.4Fn-irreducibility
Let us introduce the Fn-irreducibility of k[Fn⋊αG]-modules.
Deﬁnition 5.14 (Fn-irreducibility) .For a left k[Fn⋊G]-module V, we say that Vis
Fn-irreducible if Vhas no nontrivial k[Fn]-submodule.
Obviously, if VisFn-irreducible, then Vis irreducible as a k[Fn⋊αG]-module. More-
overwecanseethatif VisFn-irreducible, then Visanobjectofthecategory ModNT
k[Fn⋊αG].
Then it follows that the Fn-irreducibility is preserved by the KLM-functor as below.
The following is a direct corollary of Theorem5.7.
Corollary 5.15 (cf. Theorem 2.9.8 in [14], Corollary 2.5 in [25], and Corollary 3.6 in
[6]).If a leftk[Fn⋊αG]-moduleVisFn-irreducible, then KLM λ(V)isFn-irreducible for
anyλ∈k×.
Proof.Suppose thatKLM λ(V) is not Fn-irreducible. Then it contains an irreducible
k[Fn]-submodule/tildewiderW. Now let us regard KLM λ(V) and/tildewiderWas objects of ModNT
k[Fn], and
applyKLM λ−1to them. Since the Katz-Long-Moody functor is an auto-equivalen ce of
thecategory ModNT
k[Fn], inclusion relations arepreserved, namely, we have KLM λ−1(/tildewiderW)⊂
KLM λ−1◦KLM λ(V)∼=V. Moreover sinceKLM λ◦KLM λ−1(/tildewiderW)∼=/tildewiderW,KLM λ−1(/tildewiderW)/\e}a⊔io\slash=
{0}. Therefore it conclude that Vcontains the nontrivial k[Fn]-submoduleKLM λ−1(/tildewiderW).
6 Constructing local systems via Katz-Long-Moody
functor
The Katz middle convolution is known to be a quite eﬃcient machinery to construct local
systems on C\{n-points}and to investigate their properties. This machinery is called by
44a special name, the Katz algorithm. On the other hand, we have see n that many good
properties of Katz middle convolution and Long-Moody functors fo r representations of
braid groups are naturally uniﬁed in our framework of KLM-functor . Thus it is possible
to extend the Katz algorithm to many other local systems through our KLM-functor.
Namely, if Fn⋊αGis the fundamental group of a topological space X, the category
Modk[Fn⋊αG]is equivalent to that of local systems of k-vector spaces over X. Therefore
if we repeatedly apply the KLM-functor and the multiplication functo r to a local system
overX, then inﬁnitely many non-isomorphic local systems over Xare obtained.
6.1Fn⋊Bnas a fundamental group
Let us see that Fn⋊Bncan be regarded as a fundamental group of a topological space.
LetBn(C) ={{c1,...,c n}⊂C|ci/\e}a⊔io\slash=cj, i/\e}a⊔io\slash=j}be the conﬁguration space of unordered
npoints in C. Here we regard Bn(C) as a topological space via the bijection Bn(C)∋
{c1,...,c n}/maps⊔o→[(c1,...,c n)]∈{(a1,...,a n)∈Cn|ai/\e}a⊔io\slash=ajfori/\e}a⊔io\slash=j}/Sn. Let us take
ai= (i,0)∈R2=C,i= 1,...,n, as before and put a:={a1,...,a n}∈Bn(C). Then for
any closed path γinBn(C) with the base point adeﬁnes the geometric braid
bγ: [0,1]∋t/maps⊔o−→(γ(t),t)∈Bn(C)×[0,1]
and this correspondence deﬁnes the isomorphism π1(Bn(C),a)∼=Bn.
Let us consider another topological space
B1,n(C) :={(z,{c1,...,c n})∈C×Bn(C)|z /∈{c1,...,c n}}.
Then the projection map
bn:B1,n(C)∋(z,{c1,...,c n})/maps⊔o−→{c1,...,c n}∈Bn(C)
is a locally trivial ﬁbration with the ﬁber C\{n-points}, and the cross section
sbn:Bn(C)∋{c1,...,c n}/maps⊔o−→/parenleftigg
1+n/summationdisplay
i=1|ci|,{c1,...,c n}/parenrightigg
∈B1,n(C)
deﬁnes the split short exact sequence
1→π1(C\{a1,...,a n},sbn(a))→π1(B1,n(C),sbn(a))→π1(Bn(C),a)→1.
Here we notice that the n-points set awas denoted by Qnin previous sections and
D\Qn=D\{a1,...,a n}is a deformation retract of C\{a1,...,a n}. Therefore the line
segment dsbn(a) deﬁnes the isomorphism
π1(C\{a1,...,a n},sbn(a))∼=π1(D\Qn,d) =/a\}b∇acke⊔le{⊔x1,...,x n/a\}b∇acke⊔∇i}h⊔=Fn.
The above split exact sequence gives the decomposition
π1(B1,n(C),sbn(a))∼=π1(C\{a1,...,a n},sbn(a))⋊π1(Bn(C),a)
where the action of π1(Bn(C),a) onπ1(C\{a1,...,a n},sbn(a)) is given by the Artin rep-
resentation under the identiﬁcations π1(C\{a1,...,a n},sbn(a))∼=Fnandπ1(Bn(C),a)∼=
Bn. Thus we obtain the isomorphism
π1(B1,n(C),sbn(a))∼=Fn⋊θArtinBn,
which gives a realization of Fn⋊θArtinBnas the fundamental group of B1,n(C).
456.2 Complements of polynomial coverings
Let us recall the polynomial covering introduced by Hansen, see [7]. LetXbe a 0-
connectedtopologicalspace. A simple Weierstrass polynomial isafunction f:X×C→C
of the form
f(x,z) =zn+n/summationdisplay
i=1ai(x)zi,(x,z)∈X×C,
whereai:X→C,i= 1,...,n, are continuous functions such that for any x∈X, the
polynomial f(x,z) ofzhas no multiple roots. For a simple Weierstrass polynomial f, the
map
zf:X∋x/maps⊔o−→{z∈C|f(x,z) = 0}∈Bn(C)
is called the root map associated with f. Then it is known that
ef:Ef:={(x,z)∈X×C|f(x,z) = 0}∋(x,z)/maps⊔o−→x∈X
becomes an n-fold covering, see [7]. It is moreover known that the complement Cf:=
(X×C)\Efdeﬁnes a ﬁber bundle as follows.
Theorem 6.1 (Hansen [7], Møller [20], Cohen-Suciu [4]) .The projection map
cf:Cf={(x,z)∈X×C|f(x,z)/\e}a⊔io\slash= 0}∋(x,z)/maps⊔o−→x∈X
is a locally trivial bundle, with the structure group Bn, and ﬁber C\{n-points}. Moreover
this ﬁbration has a cross section sf:X→Cfdeﬁned by
sf(x) :=
x,1+/summationdisplay
z∈zf(x)|z|
∈Cf,
which induces the split short exact sequence
1→π1(C\zf(x),sf(x))→π1(Cf,sf(x))→π1(X,x)→1
for an arbitrarily ﬁxed x∈Xand the decomposition
π1(Cf,sf(x))∼=π1(C\zf(x),sf(x))⋊π1(X,x).
Here in the semidirect product, π1(X,x)acts onπ1(C\zf(x),sf(x))through the Artin
representation
π1(X,x)zf∗−−→π1(Bn(C),zf(x))θArtin−−−→Aut(Fn)
under the natural identiﬁcations π1(C\zf(x),sf(x))∼=Fnandπ1(Bn(C),zf(x))∼=Bn.
Deﬁnition 6.2 (Polynomial complement ﬁbration) .LetXbe a 0-connected topological
space and f:X×C→Ca simple Weierstrass polynomial. Then we call the ﬁbration
cf:Cf→Xdeﬁned above the polynomial complement ﬁbration with respect to f.
We note that the previously deﬁned ﬁbration bn:B1,n(C)→Bn(C) is a polynomial
complement ﬁbration with respect to the simple Weierstrass polynom ial
Bn(C)×C∋({c1,...,c n},z)/maps⊔o−→n/productdisplay
i=1(z−ci)∈C,
46and any polynomial complement ﬁbration cf:Cf→Xcan be obtained by the pull-
back ofbnwith respect to the root map zf:X→Bn(C), i.e., we have cf=z∗
f(bn) and
Cf=z∗
f(B1,n(C)), see [20].
Further we note that complements of polynomial coverings are clos ed under the pull-
back. Namely, let φ:Y→Xbe a continuous map between 0-connected topological
spaces and cf:Cf→Xthe polynomial complement ﬁbration with respect to a simple
Weierstrass polynomial f. Then g:=f◦(φ×idC):Y×C→Cbecomes a simple
Weierstrass polynomial again and we can see that cg=φ∗(cf) andCg=φ∗(Cf).
Therefore one can conclude that for an Artin representation ( G,α) onFn, ifGis
a fundamental group of a topological space Ywhich has the homotopy type of a CW-
complex, then there exists a simple Weierstrass polynomial f:Y×C→Cand the
corresponding ﬁbration cf:Cf→Ysuch that
π1(Cf)∼=Fn⋊αG. (25)
Thisisveriﬁedasfollows. Recallthatitiswell-known thatforeverygr ouphomomorphism
α:π1(Y,y)→π1(Bn(C),α(y)), there is a continuous map φ:Y→Bn(C) up to homotopy
equivalence such that α=φ∗, see [10] for instance. Then the pull-back of bn:Bn,1(C)→
Bn(C)byφdeﬁnes thepolynomial complement ﬁbration cf:Cf→Ywithφ:Y→Bn(C)
as the root map. Thus Theorem 6.1 gives us the desired isomorphism ( 25).
6.3 Complements of ﬁber-type arrangements
We recall that complements of ﬁber-type arrangements have fun damental group of the
formsFn⋊αGwith some Artin representations ( G,α).
Deﬁnition 6.3 (Strictly linearly ﬁbered arrangements) .LetAandBbe hyperplane
arrangements in Cl+1andClrespectively. Then we say that Aisstrictly linearly ﬁbered
overBifthereexistsanisomorphism Cl+1∼=Cl×Candthefollowingholds. Namely, under
the identiﬁcation Cl+1∼=Cl×Cchosen above, the projection p:Cl×C∋(x,z)/maps⊔o→x∈Cl
satisﬁes that p(Cl+1\A) =Cl\Bandp:Cl+1\A→Cl\Bis a locally trivial ﬁbration with
the ﬁber C\{n-points}for some positive integer n.
LetFn(C) :={(c1,...,c n)∈Cn|ci/\e}a⊔io\slash=cj, i/\e}a⊔io\slash=j}be the conﬁguration space of n
points in C. Then we can see that the projection fn:Fn+1(C)∋(c1,...,c n,cn+1)/maps⊔o→
(c1,...,c n)∈Fn(C) is a polynomial complement ﬁbration with respect to the simple
Weierstrass polynomial Fn(C)×C∋((c1,...,c n),z)/maps⊔o→/producttextn
i=1(z−ci)∈C. Then the fol-
lowingresultbyCohenassuresthattheaboveﬁbration p:Cl+1\A→Cl\Bisapolynomial
complement ﬁbration.
Theorem 6.4 (Cohen [3]) .LetAbe an arrangement of m+nhyperplanes in Cl+1andB
an arrangement of mhyperplanes in Cl. Suppose thatAis strictly linearly ﬁbered over B.
Then the ﬁbration p:Cl+1\A→Cl\Bin Deﬁnition 6.3 is a pull-back of the polynomial
complement ﬁbration fn:Fn+1(C)→Fn(C).
Then the result in previous section shows that there exists an Artin representation
α:π1(Cl\B)→Aut(Fn) and the fundamental group π1(Cl+1\A) decomposes as the semi-
direct product
π1(Cl+1\A)∼=Fn⋊απ1(Cl\B).
Now we introduces ﬁber-type arrangements.
47Deﬁnition 6.5 (Fiber-type arrangements) .LetAbe a hyperplane arrangement in Cl.
Then we say that Aisﬁber-type , if there exists a sequence ( Ak)k=1,...,lof hyperplane
arrangements in Ck,k= 1,...,l, such thatAl=AandAk+1are strictly linearly ﬁbered
overAkfork= 1,...,l−1.
The above discussion shows that if Ais a ﬁber-type arrangement in Cl,l≥2, then
there exists a sequence of Artin representations αk:π1(Ck\Ak)→Aut(Fdk) with some
positive integers dk,k= 1,...,l, and we have
π1(Cl\A)∼=Fdl−1⋊αl−1π1(Cl−1\Al−1)
∼=Fdl−1⋊αl−1Fdl−2⋊αl−2π1(Cl−2\Al−2)
···
∼=Fdl−1⋊αl−1Fdl−2⋊αl−2···⋊α1π1(C\A1)
∼=Fdl−1⋊αl−1Fdl−2⋊αl−2···⋊α1Fd0.
Here we put d0to be the cardinality of the set A1of points in C.
Remark 6.6. The braid arrangement Abr
C:={(x1,...,x l)∈Cl|/producttext
i≤i<j≤l(xi−xj) = 0}
isa typical example of ﬁber-type arrangements, andit is well-known that the fundamental
group of the complement of Abr
Cis isomorphic to the pure braid group of degree l. In the
paper [9], Haraoka deﬁnes an endfunctor of the category of k-local systems on Cl\Abr
Cas
a generalization of the Katz middle convolution. Then we can check th at this Haraoka’s
middle convolution is isomorphic to our KLM-functor in this case. The d etail will be
discussed in the forthcoming paper [21] by the second author.
6.4 Complements of closed braids in the solid torus
We recall that fundamental groups of complements of closed braid s in the solid torus are
of the forms Fn⋊αGwith Artin representations ( G,α).
Forβ∈Bn, we write the closure of βin the solid torus T:=D×S1byˆβ. Then we can
see that the projection T\ˆβ→S1becomes a ﬁber bundle with the ﬁber D\{n-points}.
For a point d∈∂D, we can take a cross section sd:S1∋x/maps⊔o→(d,x)∈T\ˆβof the bundle,
which corresponds to a longitude of T. Therefore we obtain the split short exact sequence
1→π1(D\{n-points},d)→π1(T\ˆβ,sd(s))→π1(S1,s)→1
for a ﬁxed s∈S1, and the following holds.
Theorem 6.7 (see Birman [2] for example) .Let us take β∈Bnand write the corre-
sponding closed braid in the solid torus T:=D×S1byˆβ. Then the fundamental group
of the complement has the following decomposition,
π1(T\ˆβ)∼=Fn⋊φβZ,
where the Artin representation φβ:Z→Aut(Fn)is deﬁned by 1/maps⊔o→θArtin(β).
6.5 A construction of integral representations of non-rigi d local
systems via rigid local systems
It is well-known that rank 2 irreducible local systems on C\{0,1}are realized as solution
sheaves of Gauss hypergeometric diﬀerential equations and they are typical examples of
48rigid local systems in the sense of Katz [14]. On the other hand, rank 2 local systems on
C\{0,1,λ}for some ﬁxed λ∈C\{0,1}are known to be the ﬁrst example of non-rigid
local systems, we call these local systems Heun local systems , because they correspond to
solution sheaves of Heun diﬀerential equations.
It might not to be able to expect that solutions of linear diﬀerential e quations cor-
responding to non-rigid local systems have integral representat ions like Gauss hypergeo-
metric functions whose integrands are expressed by some element ary functions. However
our KLM-functor gives us some special examples of non-rigid local s ystems whose corre-
sponding diﬀerential equations may have integral representation s of their solutions.
Let us take an group homomorphisms α∈Hom(F3,B4) and choose a continuous map
φα:C\{0,1,λ}→B4(C) as before so that ( φα)∗=α. Thenpα:Xα→C\{0,1,λ}be the
pull-back of b4:B1,4(C)→B4(C) with respect to φα:C\{0,1,λ}→B4(C). Then the
cross section sα:C\{0,1,λ}→Xαin Theorem 6.1 gives us the decomposition
π1(Xα)∼=F4⋊απ1(C\{0,1,λ})
as before. Let us suppose that there exists a character χ:F4⋊απ1(C\{0,1,λ})→C×
such that
χ(xi) = 1 for i= 1,4, χ(xi)/\e}a⊔io\slash= 1 fori= 2,3.
Then if we take τ∈C×\{χ(x1x2x3x4)−1}, a direct computation tells us that KLM τ(χ)
becomes a rank 2 local system. Therefore the pull-back local syst ems∗
α(KLM τ(χ)) with
respect to the cross section sα:C\{0,1,λ} →Xαgives a Heun local system. Since
KLM τ(χ) can be seen as a subspace of the Borel-Moore homology group with rank
1 local system as the coeﬃcients, we may conclude that KLM τ(χ) gives an integral
representationofthisspecialHeunlocalsystemwhoseintegrand istherank1localsystem.
