Direct dissociative recombination and resonant ion-pair f ormation reactions of HeH+are theoret-
ically studied using time-dependant wave-packets methods . The wave packets are propagated on
potential energy curves that are in either the adiabatic rep resentation or the diabatic representa-
tion. The reaction cross sections are computed for collisio ns of diﬀerent isotopes of He and H. The
reactions are modeled in the collision energy range 0 eV to 50 eV. Final states distributions are also
investigated for the4HeH+dissociative recombination reaction, showing dominance o f contribution
from states of2Σ symmetry in the diabatic representation. In the adiabatic representation, the
2Π and2∆ states dominate at lower collision energies. The resonant ion-pair formation reaction
is investigated using two sets of representation for the pot ential energy curve of the ion-pair state.
The results are compared with available experimental and ot her theoretical results. The present
model yields a reaction cross section that is larger than pre vious results.
I. INTRODUCTION
Dissociativerecombination(DR) andresonantion-pair
(RIP) formation processes are amongst some of the most
important fundamental chemical processes that modify
the charge and energy balance in low-temperature plas-
mas. DR is a process whereby a molecular cation col-
lides with and captures an electron. This results in the
formation of a resonant neutral molecule, in an excited
repulsive state which then dissociates into neutral frag-
ments. In the RIP formation process, on the other hand,
the resulting fragments consist of an ion-pair. In order
to model the plasma environments correctly, a more de-
tailed understanding of the driving mechanisms and re-
action cross sections of these processes is needed.
There are two mechanisms in which the DR process
proceeds. Firstly, the DR process can take place when
anincident electroniscapturedintoarepulsiveelectronic
state of the neutral molecule and the nuclei breaks down
inthispotential. Suchamoleculeisstabilizedagainstthe
competing autoionization process when the internuclear
separation is such that the potential energy curve of the
neutral lies below the ionic ground-statepotential energy
curve. This is known as the direct mechanism of the DR
reaction. On the other hand, the indirect mechanism
for DR occurs when the electron is captured into a vi-
brationally excited molecular Rydberg state, of the neu-
tral molecule. It then predissociates with the repulsive
state. It has been proposed that of the two mechanisms,
∗snkambule@uniswa.szthe direct DR mechanism is normally the most dominant
process [1]. However, Sarpal et al[2] pointed out that in-
terferencebetweenthetwoprocessesmaygenerallyresult
in complicated resonance structure in the cross section.
Forthe HeHsystem, the covalentresonatstatespotential
energy curves do not cross the potential energy curve of
HeH+[3]. However, it has been previously discussed [4]
that direct DR is still possible, while autoinization at
short internuclear distances, is a possibility as well.
In early universe gas evolution, the HeH+ion is be-
lieved to have played a very important role in gas cool-
ing [5]. It is also believed that this ion is one of the key
ingrediants neccessary in studies of the understanding
the chemistry of interstellar plasmas [6, 7]. There were
previously some diﬃculty in detecting the ion in the in-
terstellar medium [8] and this seemed to contradict the
predictions that HeH+could be abundant [9]. However,
it was later found that these predictions were neglecting
the destruction of HeH+by the DR process [10]. This
process can be represented as
HeH++e−→HeH∗→He+H, (1)
where HeH∗denotes a neutral, repulsive and unstable
resonant state which then breaks down to the fragments,
He and H. There is a possibility of these fragments to be
electronically excited. The RIP formation reaction, on
the other hand, can be represented as
HeH++e−→HeH∗→He++H−.(2)
It can be seen that processes (1) and (2) only diﬀer in
the ﬁnal fragments formed, on whether they are charged
on neutral. They are therefore competing procceses
amongst many other processes [3].2
In the interstellar environments, HeH+is expected to
participate in a large variety of other processes, such as
the spontaneous emission of low energy photons from the
ion. It has been suggested that such a process could be
an important factor in primordial star formation [11].
The collision of an electron with the molecular ion could
result in a number of other processes, ranging from elas-
tic scattering to inelastic processes. These processes are
vibrational excitation, rotational excitation and dissocia-
tive excitation, to name just a few. All these processes
are expected to compete with processes (1) and (2). It
is speculated that HeH+is probably one of the oldest
molecular ions in the universe and it had eluded astro-
physical observation for decades. It was until recently
that Guesten et al[12] ﬁnally reported a positive detec-
tion of the ions in the nebula NGC 7027.
When modeling the chemistry of the interstellar
medium, an observable abundance of HeH+was pre-
dicted [9]. Further, it was proposed that the destruction
rate of HeH+is increased by the DR process with low
energy electrons. Numerous theoretical calculations of
potential energy curves for HeH+and HeH have failed
to show the desired crossing of the ionic ground state by
a neutral repulsive state. This for a long time, led to a
belief that the DR reaction rate of HeH+is very low. On
the contrary, single-pass and storage ring experiments all
found and conﬁrmed a large recombination rate [13–16].
Further experimental work was carried out by Seminiak
et al[17] to measure the ﬁnal products states distribu-
tion formed in DR reaction of3HeD+and4HeH+. This
study was carried out by using the CRYRING [13] and
TSR [18] heavy ion storage rings. The results obtained
were in agreement with earlier theoretical results based
in MQDT theory [10]. However, it was found that there
was a discrepancy with the theoretical results of Sarpal
et al[2] which were based on the R-matrix theory.
The potential energy curves used in the current study
are those reported by Larson et al[19, 20]. Eleven po-
tential energy curves for resonant states of HeH in the
2Σ+symmetry are computed together with six in the2Π
symmetry and six in the2∆ symmetry. Previously a the-
oretical study of the DR reaction of HeH+was carried
out by Larson et al[21]. In the study only six (two of
2Σ symmetry and two of2Π symmetry) states were in-
cluded. A two-by-two adiabatic to diabatic state trans-
formation [22] was carried out to obtain the potential
energy of the ion-pair state and diabatic electronic en-
ergy curves. No rotational couplings between states were
considered. In the current study, 23 resonant states are
included in both the diabatic and adiabatic represena-
tion. Theseareresonantstatesthat areabovetheground
state of HeH+, but below the excited state. They con-
sist of eleven states of2Σ, six states of2Π and six states
of2∆ symmetries. Rotational couplings between states
of diﬀerent symmetries are also included. A strict dia-
batization of the 23 coupled states is also carried out in
order to study the dissociation dynamics in the diabatic
representation.This paper is arranged as follows; Section II discusses
the potential energy curves and how the rotational cou-
plings are computed. The nuclear dynamics relevant for
the direct capture and dissociation amongst the resonant
states of HeH and the ion-pair, He++H−are outlined in
section III. Secton IV contains the results and discussion
of the results. Lastly, a conclusion is given in section V.
II. POTENTIAL ENERGY CURVES
Thepotentialcurvesforthesystemthatareusedinthe
current study are those that are ﬁrst reported by some
of us in ref [19], where the full conﬁguration interaction
level of theory is used for the electronic structure calcu-
lation. This is then combined with electron scattering
calculations that are based in the complex-Kohn varia-
tional method [23]. The electron scattering calculations
give the resonant states energy positions above the po-
tential energy curves of the ground state of the ion. The
autoinization widths, Γ( R), are also obtained and they
are non-zero at short internuclear distances. At large in-
ternuclear distances, Γ( R)→0. The adiabatic potential
energy curves and autoinization widths are in ﬁgures 1
and 4(a) of ref. [19] , respectively.
In the adiabatic representation, the resonant states of
2Σ symmetry do not preserve their character. The state
lowest in energy has an ion-pair character at short in-
ternuclear distances, while this character is exhibited by
thestatehighestinenergyatlargeinternucleardistances.
Avoidedcrossingsareobservedwheneverthereisaswitch
from ion-pair state to a covalent state [20]. However,
in the diabatic representation the lowest resonant state,
at short internucler distances, crosses the other resonant
states and dissociates to the ion-pair He++H−, while
the othercovalentstatesdissociatestoneutralfragments.
A. Rotational Couplings
TheL-uncoupling term of the rotational Hamiltonian
can be given as [24],

2µ[J(J+1)−Ω(Ω±1)]1
2×
/angbracketleftJ,S,Ω±1,Λ,Σ±1|L±|J,S,Ω,Λ,Σ/angbracketright,(3)
whereJ,L, andSare well-known quantum numbers
and Ω, Λ and Σ are their respective projections onto the
molecular axis. JandLare the total angular momen-
tum and total orbital angular momentum operators, re-
spectively. Here we shall denote the molecular electronic
wavefunctions for the2Σ+,2Π and2∆ states as Φ Σ, ΦΠ
and Φ ∆, respectively. Based on the selection rules, the
allowed diﬀerence between any two symmetries is such
that ∆Λ = ±1. Thus rotational couplings between Φ Σ3
and Φ ∆is zero. Compared to the term ℓ(ℓ+ 1), the
term Ω(Ω+1) in eq. (3) is very small (1
4) and thus if
neglected, the rotational couplings between Φ Σand Φ Π
states are
−[ℓ(ℓ+1)]1

2µR2/angbracketleftΦΠ|L±|ΦΣ/angbracketright. (4)
ℓare the well-known rotational quantum numbers. From
the electronic structure calculations for the electronic
states of the HeH system [19], the dominant conﬁgura-
tions for covalent states associated with the same asymp-
totc limit is of the form (1 σ)1(2σ)1(nλ)1. Thus the elec-
tronic states of diﬀerent symmetries in the system are
related by

(npδ)1/vextendsingle/vextendsingleℓ+/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(npπ)1/angbracketrightbig
,(6)
whereL+has been decomposed into one-electron opera-
tors,ℓ+. Applyingthepureprecisionapproximation[25],
eq. (5) and eq. (6) reduces to
/angbracketleftΦΠ|L±|ΦΣ/angbracketright=√
2 (7)
and
/angbracketleftΦ∆|L±|ΦΠ/angbracketright=√
2, (8)
respectively. For covalent states associated with diﬀerent
asymptotic limits,
/angbracketleftΦΠ|L±|ΦΣ/angbracketright= 0 (9)
/angbracketleftΦ∆|L±|ΦΠ/angbracketright= 0. (10)
Based on the above discussion for the rotational cou-
plings, the adiabatic potential energy curves for the sys-
tem is represented with the electronic potential energies
obtained from the electronic structure calculations [19].
In addition, there are now rotational quantum number
dependant oﬀ-diagonal elements of the form

The strict adiabatic to diabatic transformation is car-
ried out, with the inclusion of rotational couplings, to
obtain diabatic potential energy curves and electronic
couplings as previously discusssed by Larson et al[20].
III. NUCLEAR DYAMICS
The study of dynamics for the dissociation are carried
out by solving the time-dependant Schr¨ odinger equation,
i∂
∂tΨ(R,t) =HTΨ(R,t). (12)By direct integration of eq. (12), a wave packet is propa-
gated with the local complex potential. For states iand

ref. [20].

previoulsy that the electronic couplings of eq. (16) varies
smoothly with Rcompared with the nonadiabatic cou-
plings of eq. (14) [27–29].

Schr¨ odinger equation for the potential energy curve of
the ground state of the ion. The wave packets are
then propagated on the potential energy curves, in each
representation (adiabatic and diabatic), using a numer-
ical algorithm based on the Cranck-Nicholson propa-
gation method [31], while autoionization is included,4
as a local complex potential, within the “boomerang”
model [32, 33].

IV. RESULTS
A. DR Reaction Cross Section for4HeH+
The DR reaction cross section is computed by ﬁrst
propagating the wave packets on the 23 adiabatic po-
tential energy curves of4HeH. Rotational coupling be-
tween states of diﬀerent symmetries are here taken into
consideration. The calculated partial cross sections for
each of the states in the diﬀerent symmetries are shown
in ﬁgures 1(a), 1(b) and 1(c). The states for2Π and2∆
symmetries are doubly degenerate [19]. Thus, as seen in
ﬁgure1(b)andﬁgure1(c), twovaluesofthecrosssections
are lying on top of each other. The threshold energy, for
all symmetries in the adiabatic representation, is above
six eV. Below this energy, the HeH resonant states are
not dissociating into the neutral fragments. Propagat-
ing wave packets on the HeH resonant states produces
a DR reaction cross section that has some sharp peaks
and oscillations. Some of these peaks can be explained
by the shape resonances formed when the potential en-
ergy curve of a state has a barrier, in particular at low
collision energies. The regular oscillations that are ob-
served at above 10 eV are due to energy dependence of
the electron capture probability [35, 36].
The DR reaction cross section is also computed in the
diabatic representation. In this representation, the states
have no non-adabatic couplings but are coupled by elec-
tronic couplings. The DR reaction cross section results
are shown, for the three symmetries, in ﬁgures 2(a), 2(b)
and 2(c). It should be noted that in this representation,
the electronic states are not pure Σ, Π or ∆ symme-
try [20]. In this representation, the threshhold energy is
above eight eV.
The DR reaction cross section contribution of elec-
tronic states for each symmetry to the reaction’s to-
tal cross section is investigated in both representations. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2

B. Study Isotope Eﬀect in DR reaction of HeH+
The DR reaction cross section is also calculated for
the3HeH+,3HeD+,3HeT+,4HeD+and4HeT+isotopo-
logues. The study is carried out in the adiabatic repre-
sentation. The cross sections are computed for all states
in all symmetries and are shown in ﬁgures 4. The total
cross section results are compared with the DR reaction
cross sections that have been reported before from the
theoretical [21] and experimental results [14, 16]. These
results are only reported for some isotopologues, hence
there are no comparisons for the DR reaction of3HeT+
and4HeT+. For all isotopologues, the electronic states
in the2Σ+symmetry are contributing more to the total
cross section. An observable trend in the DR reaction
cross section from the diﬀerent isotopologues is the in-
crease in the value to the total crossm section with the
decrease in the reduced mass.6

For the ion-pair formation process, the calculation is
carried out using two diﬀerent methods: In method 1 ,
the wave packets are propagated on an ion-pair potential
energy curve obtained from the two-by-two adiabatic-to-
diabatic transformation [29]. In this approach, only two
adiabatic states are assumed to be interacting near an
avoidedcrossingand thus allother statesareneglected in
thetransformation. Thusthestatesaretransformedsuch
that the ion-pair/covalent character is preserved [27, 29].
The ion-pair state potential energy curve obtained using
this approach is labelled 1 in ﬁgure 5. In method 2 , the
wave-packets are propagated on a potential energy curve
obtained from the strict adiabatic-to-diabatic transfor-mation of 23 coupled states [20]. Using this approach,
the potential energy curves for the diabatic states will
cross each other [20]. However, the ion-pair and covalent
character is preserved on each of the potential energy
curves. The ion-pair character will be for the potential
energy curve that is highest in energy at large internu-
clear distances. The potential energy curve for the elec-
tronic states obtained using this procedure is labelled 2
in ﬁgure 5. These potential energy curves are all shifted
such that the minimum energy of the ground state of the
ion (HeH+) has its energy equal to zero.
The resonant ion-pair formation reaction total cross
section for all diﬀerent isotopologues obtained by using
method 1 andmethod 2 are shown in ﬁgure 6(a) and
ﬁgure 6(b), respectively. The results are compared with
previous theoretical results [21]. The current cross sec-
tion is about twice as large as the previous results. This
could be attributed to the treatment of all states as in-
teracting, via non-adibatic couplings, and the inclusion
of rotational couplings between states of diﬀerent sym-
metries. The signiﬁcant number of states included in
this study compared to the previous study is also an-
other factor. At low collision energies (below 12 eV) ,
the theoretical model used by Larson et al[21] yeilded
a value close to zero. The current method is yielding a
very large cross section in both procedures. In method
1, in the energy range 16 eV to 22 eV, the reaction cross
section is almost equal with the previous results. How-
everinmethod 2 , the crosssection is still larger, even in
this range. The cross section, thereafter, decreases with
collision energy. Other competing processes [3] could be
signiﬁcantly impacting the ion-pair formation process.
Cross section from collisions of lighter isotopes is big-
ger than cross sections from heavier isotopes. The same
trend was observedpreviously[21]. The ion-pairreaction
cross section goes to zero at higher collision energies.
V. CONCLUSION
The reaction cross section for the DR and RIP forma-
tion has been theoretically studied using time-dependant
methods. The resulsts are showing a larger DR re-
action cross section when comparing with previous re-
sults [14, 16, 21]. For the theoretical results, the discrep-
anciesare attributed to the diﬀerence in number of states
that are included in the model. In current study 23 reso-
nant states are included while in the previous study ony
six states were included. The DR reaction cross section
decreases, as the collision energy increases, in particular
above 20 eV. This could be due to other competing pro-
cesses [3] that start to be signiﬁcant. The sharp peaks
and oscillation in the cross section could be attributed to
shape resonances formed by barriers in the potential en-
ergy curve landscape. At higher energies, the oscilations
couldbeduetothefactthetheelectroncaptureprobabil-
ity is energy dependant [35, 36]. For the DR process, the
cross section exhibits the prevalence of quantum tunnel-7

ing in the adiabatic representation than in the diabatic
representation.
The rotational couplings seem to be increasing the DR
reaction ﬂux to the states of2Σ symmetry as observed
by the high branching section ratio in the diabatic rep-
resentation. Although the2Σ states contribution is still
larger at higher energies, their contribution is slightly
lower than the2Π and2∆ states in the adiabatic repre-
sentation. The DR reaction cross section for species with
abiggerreducedmassislowerthanthatfromalighterre-
duced mass. In the RIP formation reaction cross section
usingmethod 1 ,thesharppeaksatlowcollisionenergies
(<10 eV) could be caused by the shape of potential en-
ergy curve. RIP formation when using method 1 gives
a larger reaction cross at lower energies than method 2 .
For collision energies above 15 eV, method 2 yields a
larger reaction cross section.ACKNOWLEDGEMETS
