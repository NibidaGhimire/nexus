and ergodic actions
by Amine Marrakchi1and Stefaan Vaes2
Abstract
Since the early days of Tomita-Takesaki theory, it is known that a v on Neumann algebra
Mthat admits a state ϕwith trivial centralizer Mϕmust be a type III 1factor, but the
converse remained open. We solve this problem and prove that such ergodic states form
a denseGδset among all faithful normal states on any III 1factor with separable predual.
Through Connes’ Radon-Nikodym cocycle theorem, this problem is r elated to the existence
of ergodic cocycle perturbations for outer group actions, which w e consider in the second
part of the paper.
1 Introduction
Thecentralizer Mϕof a faithful normal state ϕon a von Neumann algebra Mis deﬁned as the
von Neumann subalgebra of elements a∈Msatisfying the trace-like property ϕ(ax) =ϕ(xa)
for allx∈M. The centralizer Mϕcoincides with the ﬁxed point subalgebra of the modular
automorphism group ( σϕ
t)t∈R. The state ϕis atracewhenMϕ=M, or equivalently when
(σϕ
t)t∈Ris trivial. At the extreme opposite, the state ϕis said to be ergodicifMϕ=C1, which
amounts to requiring that the modular automorphism group ( σϕ
t)t∈Racts ergodically on M.
It is rather diﬃcult to produce ergodic states. In fact, the ﬁ rst example of a nontrivial factor
with an ergodic state was constructed by using the CAR functo r from quantum ﬁeld theory,
see the corollary of [HT70, Theorem 1 in Section 3] . After Connes established in [Con72]his
classiﬁcation of type III factors into subtypes III λ, λ∈[0,1], Longo proved in [Lon78, Proof of
Theorem 3] that if a von Neumann algebra Madmits an ergodic faithful normal state then it
mustbeatypeIII 1factor. However, theconverseimplication remainedanopen problem. Given
the importance of type III 1factors in quantum ﬁeld theory (see e.g. [Yng04]), this question
continued to pop up in the literature. It also appeared expli citly in[MU12], where a natural
Banach space geometry property for the predual of a von Neuma nn algebra Mis shown to be
equivalent to the absence of ergodic states on corners pMp. Our ﬁrst main result solves this
question aﬃrmatively.
For every von Neumann algebra M, we denote by S(M) the set of faithful normal states on M
and bySerg(M) the subset of ergodic faithful normal states. We denote by S1(M) the Polish
space of all normal states on M.
Theorem A. LetM/\e}atio\slash=C1be a nontrivial von Neumann algebra with separable predual. Then
the following statements are equivalent.
1.Mis a type III 1factor.
2.Serg(M)is nonempty.
3.Serg(M)is a denseGδsubset of S1(M).

1The proof of Theorem Ais based on a Baire category argument. In order to write Serg(M) as a
countable intersection of dense open sets in S(M), we combine the Connes-Størmer transitivity
theorem [CS76, Theorem 4] and Popa’s “local quantization” theorem [Pop92, Theorem A.1.2] .
Asweexplain inRemark 2.7, theseparability assumptionisessential: therearetypeI II1factors
Mwith nonseparable predual that are countably decomposable (i.e.S(M) is nonempty) but
for which Serg(M) is empty.
Givenϕ,ψ∈S(M), Connes’ Radon-Nikodym theorem (see [Con72, Th´ eor` eme 1.2.1] ) provides
a continuous 1-cocycle ut= [Dψ:Dϕ]tforσϕsatisfyingσψ
t= Adut◦σϕ
tfor allt∈R.
Theorem Ais thus naturally connected to the question which group acti onsG/archrightd⋊wnαMon a von
Neumann algebra admit an ergodic cocycle perturbation.
When Γ is a countable amenable group and Mis a II1factor with separable predual, we prove
the following general result. We denote by C(α) the space of 1-cocycles, i.e. maps v: Γ→
U(M) :g/mapsto→vgsatisfyingvgh=vgαg(vh) for allg,h∈Γ. Using the topology of pointwise
/bardbl·/bardbl2-convergence, C(α) is a Polish space. For every v∈ C(α), we denote by Ad v◦αthe action
deﬁned by (Ad v◦α)g= (Advg)◦αgfor allg∈Γ.
Theorem B. LetΓbe a countably inﬁnite amenable group and Γ/archrightd⋊wnαMan outer action of Γ
on a II 1factorMwith separable predual.
Then{v∈ C(α)|Adv◦αis ergodic }is a denseGδsubset of C(α). In particular, αadmits a
cocycle perturbation that is ergodic.
In Theorem 3.2, we deduce from Theorem Bthat an automorphism αof a II1factorMadmits
an ergodic inner perturbation Ad u◦αif and only if all nonzero powers of αare outer. We also
note in Remark 3.6that the separability assumption in Theorem Bis again essential.
In Section 3, we introduce the class Ergof countable groups Γ with the property that every
outer action of Γ on a II 1factorMadmits an ergodic cocycle perturbation. By Theorem B,
every inﬁnite amenable group belongs to Erg. It is rather easy to see (Proposition 3.4) thatErg
is closed under taking a free product with an arbitrary group , so that the free groups belong
toErg. However, “rigid” groups do not belong to Erg, see Proposition 3.5.
Finally, Theorems AandBlead to several open questions and problems that we discuss i n
Section4.

2 Ergodic states on type III 1factors
To prove Theorem A, we need several lemmas. Already in [Lon78, Proof of Theorem 3] , it
was proven that a von Neumann algebra with an ergodic faithfu l normal state must be a type
III1factor; see also [Bau95, Corollary 1.10.8] . For completeness we provide a self-contained
argument, also proving that such a state is automatically we akly mixing.
Givenϕ∈S(M), we write /bardblx/bardblϕ=/radicalbig
ϕ(x∗x) for allx∈M.
Lemma 2.1. Letϕbe a faithful normal state on a von Neumann algebra M/\e}atio\slash=C1. IfMϕ=
C1, thenMis a type III 1factor and the unitary representation (σϕ
t)t∈Ron the orthogonal
complement of C1insideL2(M,ϕ)is weakly mixing.
Proof.DenoteH=L2(M,ϕ) and letξϕ∈Hbe the vector given by 1 ∈M. Denote by
Ut(xξϕ) =σϕ
t(x)ξϕthe unitary representation as in the formulation of the lemm a.
2We ﬁrst prove that Utis weakly mixing on ξ⊥
ϕ. For every λ>0, denote by Hλ⊂Hthe closed
subspace of vectors η∈ξ⊥
ϕsatisfyingUt(η) =λitηfor allt∈R. Denote by Pλthe orthogonal
projection of HontoHλ. We have to prove that Hλ={0}for allλ>0. Assume the contrary.
We then ﬁnd λ >0 so thatPλ/\e}atio\slash= 0. We thus ﬁnd x∈Mwithϕ(x) = 0 andPλ(xξϕ)/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Deﬁney∈Mas the unique element of minimal /bardbl·/bardblϕin the/bardbl·/bardblϕ-closed convex hull of
/braceleftbig
λ−itσϕ
t(x)/vextendsingle/vextendsinglet∈R/bracerightbig
.
SincePλ(xξϕ) =yξϕ, we have that y/\e}atio\slash= 0. Also, ϕ(y) = 0 and σϕ
t(y) =λityfor allt∈R.
It follows that y∗yandyy∗belong toMϕ=C1, so thatyis a nonzero multiple of a unitary
u∈ U(M) satisfying ϕ(u) = 0 andσϕ
t(u) =λitufor allt∈R. In particular, the element uis
analytic under ( σϕ
t)t∈R, so that
1 =ϕ(u∗u) =ϕ(σϕ
i(u)u∗) =λ−1ϕ(uu∗) =λ−1.
We have proven that λ= 1. This means that u∈Mϕ=C1. Butϕ(u) = 0 and we have reached
a contradiction. So, Utis weakly mixing on ξ⊥
ϕ.
SinceZ(M)⊂Mϕ, we have that Mis a factor. To see that Mis of type III 1, we consider
the continuous core N=M⋊σϕRwith its subalgebra L(R) and prove that Nis a factor.
Recall that we may identify Nwith the subalgebra of θ-ﬁxed points in M⊗B(L2(R)), where
θt=σϕ
t⊗Adλ−t. The relative commutant of 1 ⊗L(R) insideM⊗B(L2(R)) equalsM⊗L(R).
OnM⊗L(R), we have that θt=σϕ
t⊗id. SinceMϕ=C1, it follows that L(R)′∩N=L(R).
Deﬁne the closed subgroup Λ ⊂Roft∈Rsuch thatσϕ
t= id. Since L(R)′∩N=L(R), the
center ofNequalsL(Λ)⊂L(R). So if Λ = {0}, it follows that Z(N) =C1 so thatMis of
type III 1. If Λ = R, it follows that ϕis a trace, so that M=Mϕ=C1, which we excluded.
When Λ is a nontrivial closed subgroup of R, the unitary representation Utis periodic, which
contradicts its weak mixing on ξ⊥
ϕproven above.
We will need Popa’s “local quantization” theorem.
Theorem 2.2 ([Pop92, Theorem A.1.2] ).LetNbe a II 1factor andx∈N. For every ε>0,
there exists a ﬁnite dimensional abelian subalgebra A⊂Nsuch that /bardblEA′∩N(x)−τ(x)1/bardbl2≤ε.
For our proof, we also need to reformulate Connes and Størmer ’s transitivity theorem, [CS76,
Theorem 4] in the following way. Let Mbe a von Neumann algebra and ϕ∈S(M). We deﬁne
theasymptotic centralizer Mω,ϕofϕas the quotient
Mω,ϕ=/braceleftbig
x∈ℓ∞(N,M)/vextendsingle/vextendsinglelimn→ω/bardblxnϕ−ϕxn/bardbl= 0/bracerightbig
/braceleftbig
x∈ℓ∞(N,M)/vextendsingle/vextendsinglelimn→ω(/bardblxn/bardblϕ+/bardblx∗n/bardblϕ) = 0/bracerightbig.
Note thatMω,ϕis a von Neumann algebra and that the formula ϕω(x) = limn→ωϕ(xn) deﬁnes
a faithful normal tracial state on Mω,ϕ.
Althoughwedonotneedthishere, notethatby [AH12, Lemma4.36] , thevon Neumannalgebra
Mω,ϕcoincides with the centralizer of the ultraproduct state ϕωon the Ocneanu ultrapower
Mω. Using that result, the following lemma is a consequence of [AH12, Theorem 4.20 and
Proposition 4.24] and even holds without separability assumptions. We includ e a direct proof
of this lemma that does not use the Ocneanu ultrapower but onl y the asymptotic centralizer.
Still the argument is essentially the same as in [AH12].
Lemma 2.3. LetMbe a type III 1factor with separable predual and ϕ∈S(M). ThenMω,ϕis
a II1factor.
3Proof.Letp,q∈Mω,ϕbe nonzero projections with ϕω(p) =λ=ϕω(q). We prove that pand
qare equivalent projections in Mω,ϕ. We can represent pandqby sequences of projections
pn,qn∈Msuch thatϕ(pn) =λ=ϕ(qn) for alln∈Nand such that lim n→ω/bardblpnϕ−ϕpn/bardbl= 0 =
limn→ω/bardblqnϕ−ϕqn/bardbl. SinceMis a type III factor, we can choose vn∈Msuch thatvnv∗
n=pn
andv∗
nvn=qnfor alln.
Writeϕn=pnϕpnandψn=vnϕv∗
n. Viewingλ−1ϕnandλ−1ψnas faithful normal states on
the type III 1factorpnMpn, it follows from Connes and Størmer’s [CS76, Theorem 4] that we
can choose un∈ U(pnMpn) such that /bardblunψnu∗
n−ϕn/bardbl →0. Writing wn=unvn, the sequence
(wn)n∈Ndeﬁnes an element w∈Mω,ϕsatisfyingww∗=pandw∗w=q.
Lets∈[0,1]. We next prove that there exists a projection P∈Mω,ϕsuch thatϕω(P) =
s. In combination with the fact that ϕωis a faithful normal tracial state and the fact that
projections having the same trace are equivalent, it then fo llows thatMω,ϕis a factor of type
II1. Choose a projection p∈Mwithϕ(p) =s. Writeq= 1−pand deﬁne ψ∈S(M) by
ψ=pϕp+qϕq. By Connes and Størmer’s [CS76, Theorem 4] , we can choose un∈ U(M) such
that/bardblunψu∗
n−ϕ/bardbl →0. Sincep∈Mψ, it follows that P= (unpu∗
n)n∈Ndeﬁnes a projection in
Mω,ϕwithϕω(P) =ψ(p) =ϕ(p) =s.
For every von Neumann algebra Mand everyϕ∈S(M), we denote by Eϕthe unique ϕ-
preserving conditional expectation from MontoMϕ.
Lemma 2.4. LetMbe a von Neumann algebra. Take x∈M. Then the map
S(M)∋ϕ/mapsto→ /bardblEϕ(x)/bardblϕ∈R+
is upper semicontinuous.
Proof.Fixx∈M. Since/bardblEϕ(x)/bardbl2
ϕ=/bardblx/bardbl2
ϕ−/bardblx−Eϕ(x)/bardbl2
ϕand sinceϕ/mapsto→ /bardblx/bardblϕis continuous,
it suﬃces to prove that ϕ/mapsto→ /bardblx−Eϕ(x)/bardblϕis lower semicontinuous. Assume the contrary. Take
δ≥0 and a sequence ( ϕn)n∈NinS(M) that converges to ϕ∈S(M) such that
/bardblx−Eϕn(x)/bardblϕn≤δ</bardblx−Eϕ(x)/bardblϕfor alln∈N.
After passage to a subsequence, we may assume that Eϕn(x)→y∈Mweakly∗. Since for
everya∈M, we have
ϕ(ay) = lim
nϕ(aEϕn(x)) = lim
nϕn(aEϕn(x)) = lim
nϕn(Eϕn(x)a) = lim
nϕ(Eϕn(x)a) =ϕ(ya),
we get that y∈Mϕ. Sincex−Eϕn(x)→x−yweakly∗and sincey∈Mϕ, we arrive at the
contradiction
/bardblx−y/bardblϕ≤limsup
n/bardblx−Eϕn(x)/bardblϕ≤δ</bardblx−Eϕ(x)/bardblϕ≤ /bardblx−y/bardblϕ.
The next lemma is the key step in proving Theorem A.
Lemma 2.5. LetMbe a type III 1factor with separable predual. Take x∈Mandε>0. Then
U(x,ε) =/braceleftbig
ϕ∈S(M)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/bardblEϕ(x)/bardblϕ<|ϕ(x)|+ε/bracerightbig
is a dense open subset of S(M).
4Proof.By Lemma 2.4, the map
ϕ/mapsto→ /bardblEϕ(x)/bardblϕ−|ϕ(x)|
is upper semicontinuous, so that U(x,ε) is open. We ﬁx an arbitrary ε >0 and prove that
U(x,7ε) is dense in S(M).
Fixψ∈S(M) andδ0>0. We construct a ϕ∈U(x,7ε) with/bardblψ−ϕ/bardbl<δ0. By Lemma 2.4, we
ﬁndδ >0 such that /bardblEϕ(x−Eψ(x))/bardblϕ< εfor everyϕ∈S(M) satisfying /bardblϕ−ψ/bardbl ≤δ. We
may assume that δ≤1,δ/bardblx/bardbl ≤εandδ<δ0.
Writey=Eψ(x)−ψ(x)1. By Lemma 2.3,N=Mω,ψis a II1factor with trace ψω. Sincey∈N
andψω(y) = 0, Lemma 2.2provides a ﬁnite dimensional abelian subalgebra A⊂Nsuch that
/bardblEA′∩N(y)/bardbl2≤ε.
Denote by P1,...,Pnthe minimal projections in A, so thatEA′∩N(y) =/summationtextn
i=1PiyPi. We
representPi= (pi,k)k∈N, where for each k∈N, (p1,k,...,pn,k) is a partition of unity in M.
Takingklarge enough, we thus ﬁnd a partition of unity ( p1,...,pn) inMsuch that
/vextenddouble/vextenddoublen/summationdisplay
i=1piypi/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
ψ≤2εand/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleψ−n/summationdisplay
i=1piψpi/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≤δ/2.
Letφ=/summationtextn
i=1piψpiandB=⊕n
i=1Cpi⊂Mφ. SinceMhas separable predual, the point
spectrum Λ of φis countable. Therefore, we can ﬁnd a tuple of positive real n umbers (λi)1≤i≤n
such that
•/summationtextn
i=1λiφ(pi) = 1,
• |λi−1| ≤δ/2 for alli,
•λiλ−1
j/\e}atio\slash∈Λ for every i/\e}atio\slash=j.
Then the state ϕ=/summationtextn
i=1λipiψpiwill satisfy ϕ≤(1+δ/2)φ≤2φandMϕ⊂B′∩M. Therefore
/bardblEϕ(y)/bardblϕ≤ /bardblEB′∩M(y)/bardblϕ=/vextenddouble/vextenddoublen/summationdisplay
i=1piypi/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
ϕ≤2/vextenddouble/vextenddoublen/summationdisplay
i=1piypi/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
φ= 2/vextenddouble/vextenddoublen/summationdisplay
i=1piypi/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
ψ≤4ε.
Sincey=Eψ(x)−ψ(x)1, we thus get
/bardblEϕ(Eψ(x))/bardblϕ≤ |ψ(x)|+/bardblEϕ(Eψ(x))−ψ(x)1/bardbl=|ψ(x)|+/bardblEϕ(y)/bardblϕ≤ |ψ(x)|+4ε.
Note that /bardblϕ−ψ/bardbl ≤ /bardblϕ−φ/bardbl+/bardblφ−ψ/bardbl ≤δ. Therefore, by our choice of δ, we have
/bardblEϕ(x)−Eϕ(Eψ(x))/bardblϕ≤ε.
Moreover, we have
|ψ(x)| ≤ |ϕ(x)|+δ/bardblx/bardbl ≤ |ϕ(x)|+ε.
We conclude that
/bardblEϕ(x)/bardblϕ≤ |ϕ(x)|+6ε.
So,ϕ∈U(x,7ε) and/bardblψ−ϕ/bardbl ≤δ<δ0.
We will deduce Theorem Afrom Lemma 2.5and the Baire category theorem. Since S(M) is
not closed in the Polish space S1(M), we also need the following lemma.
Lemma 2.6. LetMbe a von Neumann algebra with separable predual. Then S(M)⊂S1(M)
is a denseGδset.
5Proof.Choose a faithful normal state ϕonM. For every ψ∈S1(M), denote by supp ψits
support projection, which is the smallest projection p∈Msuch thatψ(1−p) = 0. For every
ε>0, deﬁneV(ε)⊂S1(M) by
V(ε) ={ψ∈S1(M)|ϕ(1−suppψ)<ε}.
We claim that each V(ε) is an open dense subset of S1(M) and that/intersectiontext∞
k=1V(1/k) =S(M),
which then concludes the proof of the lemma.
To prove that V(ε) is open, let ψn∈S1(M)\V(ε) be a sequence that converges to ψ∈S1(M).
We have to prove that ψ/\e}atio\slash∈V(ε). Denotepn= 1−suppψnandp= 1−suppψ. We have to
prove thatϕ(p)≥ε.
Choose a subsequence ( nk)ksuch thatpnk→a∈Mweakly∗. Note that 0 ≤a≤1. We get
that
ψ(a) = lim
kψ(pnk) = lim
kψnk(pnk) = 0.
This means that a=pap. Since 0 ≤a≤1, it follows that a≤p, so thatϕ(p)≥ϕ(a). Since
pnk→aweakly∗, alsoϕ(pnk)→ϕ(a). Sinceϕ(pnk)≥εfor allk, we conclude that ϕ(a)≥ε.
Hence,ϕ(p)≥εand we have proven that V(ε) is an open subset of S1(M).
By deﬁnition,/intersectiontext∞
k=1V(1/k) =S(M). Since S(M) is dense in S1(M), in particular all V(ε) are
dense. So the lemma is proven.
We are now ready to prove Theorem A.
Proof of Theorem A.The implication 3 ⇒2 is trivial and the implication 2 ⇒1 follows from
Lemma2.1. Now assume that 1 holds.
Observe that for every x∈Mand everyϕ∈S(M), we have
/bardblEϕ(x)/bardbl2
ϕ=/bardblEϕ(x)−ϕ(x)1/bardbl2
ϕ+|ϕ(x)|2
henceEϕ(x) =ϕ(x)1 if and only if /bardblEϕ(x)/bardblϕ≤ |ϕ(x)|. From this, we see that
Serg(M) =/braceleftbig
ϕ∈S(M)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∀x∈M, Eϕ(x) =ϕ(x)1/bracerightbig
=/intersectiondisplay
x∈M,ε>0U(x,ε)
where the sets U(x,ε) are the dense open subsets of S(M) given by Lemma 2.5.
To write this as a countable intersection, we pick ( xn)n∈Na strongly dense sequence of elements
in the unit ball of Mand a sequence ( εn)n∈Nof positive numbers that converges to 0. Then
we have
Serg(M) =/intersectiondisplay
n,k∈NU(xn,εk).
In combination with Lemma 2.6and the Baire category theorem, we conclude that Serg(M) is
a denseGδsubset of S1(M).
Remark 2.7. We note that Theorem Ais false without the separability assumption on the
predualM∗. WhenMis any type III 1factor with separable predual, ϕ∈S(M) andωis a free
ultraﬁlter on N, it follows from [AH12, Theorem 4.20] that the Ocneanu ultrapower Mωis a
factor of type III 1with the property that all its faithful normal states are uni tarily conjugate.
For the ultrapower state ϕω, the centralizer is diﬀuse by Lemma 2.3. Since all other faithful
normal states on Mωare unitarily conjugate to ϕω, they all have a diﬀuse centralizer.
63 Ergodic actions on type II 1factors
We will need the following standard averaging lemma.
Lemma 3.1 (Seee.g. [AHHM18, Lemma5.1] ).LetMbe a von Neumann algebra and ϕ∈S(M)
a faithful normal state. Let G⊂Aut(M,ϕ)be a group of ϕ-preserving automorphisms. Denote
byE:M→MGthe uniqueϕ-preserving conditional expectation on the ﬁxed point alge braMG.
Wheneverx∈Mandx/\e}atio\slash∈MG, there exists an α∈Gsuch that /bardblx−α(x)/bardblϕ>/bardblx−E(x)/bardblϕ.
Proof of Theorem B.For every nonzero element x∈Mwithτ(x) = 0, write
Ux=/braceleftbig
v∈ C(α)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∃h∈Γ :/bardblvhαh(x)v∗
h−x/bardbl2>/bardblx/bardbl2/bracerightbig
.
We ﬁrst prove that Uxis an open dense subset of C(α). It is clear that Uxis open. To prove
that everyw∈ C(α) belongs to the closure of Ux, we replace αby Adw◦αand it suﬃces to
prove that 1 lies in the closure of Ux.
Fixε >0 and a ﬁnite subset F ⊂Γ. We construct v∈ Uxsuch that /bardblvg−1/bardbl2< εfor all
g∈ F. We will ﬁnd vas an inner 1-cocycle vh=u∗αh(u) for allh∈Γ. It thus suﬃces to prove
that we can ﬁnd a unitary u∈ U(M) and an element h∈Γ such that /bardblαg(u)−u/bardbl2<εfor all
g∈ Fand/bardblαh(uxu∗)−uxu∗/bardbl2>/bardblx/bardbl2.
Fix a free ultraﬁlter ωonN. Denote by αωthe natural action of Γ on Mω. By[PSV18, Lemma
4.2], we can take a unitary V∈Mωsuch that the subfactors Mand (αω
h(VMV∗))h∈Γare all
free insideMω. Denote by P⊂Mωthe subfactor generated by ( αω
h(VMV∗))h∈Γ. By[PSV18,
Lemma 4.3] , the restriction of αωtoPis not strongly ergodic, and its ultrapower actually has
a diﬀuse ﬁxed point subalgebra. We can thus choose a projectio np∈Psuch thatτ(p) = 1/2
and/bardblαω
g(p)−p/bardbl2<ε/6 for allg∈ F.
For every ﬁnite subset J⊂Γ, we denote by PJ⊂Pthe subfactor generated by αω
h(VMV∗),
h∈J. Since the union of all PJis dense in Pand everyPJis a II 1factor, we can pick a
ﬁnite subset J⊂Γ and a projection q∈PJsuch thatτ(q) = 1/2 and/bardblp−q/bardbl2< ε/6. Since
/bardblαω
g(p)−p/bardbl2< ε/6 for allg∈ F, it follows that /bardblαω
g(q)−q/bardbl2< ε/2 for allg∈ F. Deﬁning
U= 2q−1, we have found a unitary U∈PJwithτ(U) = 0 and /bardblαω
g(U)−U/bardbl2< εfor all
g∈ F.
Since Γ is inﬁnite, we can take h∈Γ such that hJ∩J=∅. Note that αω
h(U)∈PhJ. Since
x∈MandU∈PJhave trace zero and M,PJ,PhJare free, we have
/bardblαω
h(UxU∗)−UxU∗/bardbl2

Representing U= (un)n∈Nwithun∈ U(M), there exists an n∈Nsuch that
/bardblαg(un)−un/bardbl2<εfor allg∈ F, and/bardblαh(unxu∗

Puttingu=un, the density of Uxis proven.
Let (xn)n∈Nbe a countable /bardbl·/bardbl2-dense subset of {x∈M|x/\e}atio\slash= 0,τ(x) = 0}. To conclude the
proof of the theorem, it suﬃces to show that for v∈ C(α), the action Ad v◦αis ergodic if and
only ifv∈/intersectiontext
n∈NUxn.
If Adv◦αis ergodic, then by Lemma 3.1,v∈ Uxfor every nonzero x∈Mwithτ(x) = 0.
So,v∈/intersectiontext
n∈NUxn. Ifβ= Adv◦αis not ergodic, we choose a nonzero element x∈Mwith
τ(x) = 0 andβh(x) =xfor allh∈Γ. Writeε=/bardblx/bardbl2/3. Taken∈Nsuch that /bardblx−xn/bardbl2≤ε.
Then/bardblxn/bardbl2≥ /bardblx/bardbl2−ε= 2εand
/bardblβh(xn)−xn/bardbl2≤2ε≤ /bardblxn/bardbl2for allh∈Γ.
This says that v/\e}atio\slash∈ Uxn. Thus,v/\e}atio\slash∈/intersectiontext

7Theorem 3.2. LetMbe a II 1factor with separable predual and α∈Aut(M). Then the
following statements are equivalent.
1.α∈Out(M) = Aut(M)/Inn(M)has inﬁnite order.
2. There exists a unitary u∈ U(M)such that Adu◦αis ergodic.
3. The set {u∈ U(M)|Adu◦αis ergodic }is a denseGδsubset of U(M).
Proof.1⇒3 follows from Theorem Band 3⇒2 is trivial. To conclude the proof, we assume
thatαnis inner for some n∈N,n≥1, and prove that no Ad v◦αis ergodic. Replacing α
by Adv◦α, we still have that αnis inner and we have to prove that αis not ergodic. Write
αn= Adufor someu∈ U(M). DeﬁneP=M∩ {u}′and note that Pis diﬀuse. Also note
that
Adu=αn=α◦αn◦α−1=α◦Adu◦α−1= Adα(u).
Thus,α(u) is a multiple of u, so thatα(P) =P. Sinceαnis the identity on P,αdeﬁnes
an action of the ﬁnite group Z/nZon the diﬀuse von Neumann algebra P. This action is not
ergodic, so that also αis not ergodic.
Deﬁnition 3.3. We denote by Ergthe class of countable groups Γ with the property that
every outer action of Γ on a II 1factor with separable predual admits a cocycle perturbatio n
that is ergodic.
By Theorem B, the class Ergcontains all inﬁnite amenable groups. The class Ergalso has the
following stability property, similar to [Pop18, Corollary 2.3] for the vanishing 2-cohomology
property. In particular, the free groups belong to Erg.
Proposition 3.4. IfG= Γ∗TΛis any amalgamated free product with Tﬁnite,Λany countable
group and Γ∈Erg, thenG∈Erg.
Proof.LetG/archrightd⋊wnαMbe an outer action on a II 1factorMwith separable predual. Denote
byβthe restriction of αto the subgroup Γ. Since Γ ∈Erg, we can take v∈ C(β) such that
Adv◦βis ergodic. By [Jon79, Theorem 3.1.3] , the restriction of vto the ﬁnite group Tis a
coboundary. We thus ﬁnd a unitary u∈ U(M) such that v=u∗βk(u) for allk∈T. Deﬁne
w∈ C(β) bywg=uvgβg(u∗) for allg∈Γ. Then Ad w◦βis conjugate to Ad v◦βvia the inner
automorphism Ad u. Therefore, also Ad w◦βis ergodic.
By construction, wk= 1 for allk∈T. We thus ﬁnd a unique c∈ C(α) such that cg= 1 for all
g∈Λ andcg=wgfor allg∈Γ. Since Ad w◦βis ergodic, a fortiori Ad c◦αis ergodic.
On the other hand, as with the vanishing 2-cohomology in [Pop18], there also are several
families of groups that do not belong to Erg. The result follows from a variant of Popa’s
cocycle superrigidity theorems [Pop01,Pop06] .
Proposition 3.5. IfΓhas property (T) or if Γ = Γ1×Γ2is the direct product of a nonamenable
groupΓ1and an inﬁnite group Γ2, thenΓadmits an outer action αon the hyperﬁnite II 1factor
such that for no v∈ C(α), the action Adv◦αis ergodic. In particular, Γ/\e}atio\slash∈Erg.
Proof.LetR0be a copy of the hyperﬁnite II 1factor and choose an outer action Z /archrightd⋊wnR0.
WriteR1=R⊗Γ
0and consider the diagonal action Z /archrightd⋊wnR1. Then write R=R1⋊Zand deﬁne
Γ/archrightd⋊wnαRby taking the Bernoulli action Γ /archrightd⋊wnR1and the trivial action of Γ on L(Z)⊂R.
Letv∈ C(α) andβ= Adv◦α. We have to prove that βis not ergodic. A ﬁnite group action on
a II1factor is never ergodic, so that we may assume that Γ is an inﬁn ite property (T) group or
8the direct product of a nonamenable group and an inﬁnite grou p. In both cases, Popa’s cocycle
superrigiditytheorems fortheBernoulli actions ofΓ(see [Pop01,Pop06] ) admitageneralization
to crossed products and tensor products, as written in detai l in[VV14, Theorem 7.1] . Writing
A=L(Z)⊂R, we ﬁnd a projection p∈Mn(C)⊗A, a partial isometry V∈(M1,n(C)⊗R)pand
a unitary representation π: Γ→ U(p(Mn(C)⊗A)p) such that V∗V=p,VV∗isβ-invariant
andvg(id⊗αg)(V) =Vπ(g) for allg∈Γ. ThenV(1⊗A)V∗is a diﬀuse subalgebra of a corner
ofMβ, so thatβis not ergodic.
We conclude this section by proving that the separability as sumption in Theorem Bis essential.
Remark 3.6. LetIbe an uncountable set and deﬁne Mas theI-fold tensor product of
(M2(C),τ). Then every inﬁnite countable group Γ admits an outer actio nαonMfor which no
cocycle perturbation is ergodic. To construct α, identifyIwith the disjoint union of Γ and an
uncountable set J. For every subset K⊂I, we have the corresponding subalgebra MK⊂M
given by the K-fold tensor product. In particular, M=MΓ⊗MJand we deﬁne αg=βg⊗id,
where Γ /archrightd⋊wnβMΓis the usual Bernoulli action. Then αis an outer action. If v∈ C(α), the
countability of Γ implies that we can ﬁnd a countable subset K⊂Jsuch thatvg∈MΓ⊗MK
for allg∈Γ. But then 1 ⊗MJ\Kbelongs to the ﬁxed point algebra of Ad v◦α. Soαhas no
ergodic cocycle perturbation.
4 Concluding remarks and open problems
By Lemma 2.1, we know that if ϕis an ergodic state on some factor Mthen the unitary
representation ( σϕ
t)t∈RonL2(M,ϕ)⊖Cis weakly mixing. It is thus natural to ask if Theorem A
can be strengthened in the following way.
Open problem 4.1. LetMbe a type III 1factor with separable predual. Can we ﬁnd ϕ∈
Serg(M) such that the unitary representation ( σϕ
t)t∈RonL2(M,ϕ)⊖Cis mixing, or even a
multiple of the regular representation?
Note that examples of such mixing states are given by the quas i-free states on Araki-Woods
factors (or free-quasi-free states on free Araki-Woods fac tors) associated to mixing orthogonal
representations of Rby the CAR functor.
The next problem asks for a relative version of Theorem A.
Open problem 4.2. LetN⊂Mbe an inclusion of von Neumann algebras with faithful
normal conditional expectation E:M→N. When does there exist an ergodic ϕ∈S(M) that
isE-invariant: ϕ◦E=ϕ?
In Theorem 4.3, we provide a criterion and a necessary condition towards an swering Problem
4.2. In Remark 4.4, we then relate Problem 4.2to Connes’ bicentralizer problem. Before
presenting this, we need some notation and preliminaries.
Recall that S1(M) denotes the set of normal states on M. We deﬁne S1(M,E) ={ϕ∈S1(M)|
ϕ◦E=ϕ},S(M,E) =S1(M,E)∩S(M) andSerg(M,E) =S(M,E)∩Serg(M). We ﬁrst exclude
the trivial case N=C1, because then S(M,E) is a singleton. Since any ϕ∈Serg(M,E) is in
particular an ergodic state on N, the set Serg(M,E) can only be nonempty if Nis a factor of
type III 1. So we only consider Problem 4.2whenNis a III 1factor.
Given a type III 1factorNand an inclusion N⊂Mwith expectation E:M→N, for every
ϕ∈S(M,E), therelative bicentralizer B(N⊂M,ϕ) was studied in [AHHM18] . It is deﬁned
9as the von Neumann subalgebra of elements x∈Mthat satisfy anx−xan→0∗-strongly for
every bounded sequence an∈Nwith/bardblanϕ−ϕan/bardbl →0.
By[AHHM18, Theorem A] , the relative bicentralizer B(N⊂M,ϕ) does not depend on the
choice ofϕ∈S(M,E) up to the following canonical isomorphism. When ψ∈S(M,E), by
Connes and Størmer’s [CS76, Theorem 4] , we can choose a sequence of unitaries un∈ U(N)
suchthat /bardblunϕu∗
n−ψ/bardbl →0. By[AHHM18, TheoremA] , thereisaunique ∗-isomorphism βfrom
B(N⊂M,ϕ) toB(N⊂M,ψ) satisfying unxu∗
n→β(x)∗-strongly for all x∈B(N⊂M,ϕ).
Note that the modular automorphism group σϕleavesB(N⊂M,ϕ) globally invariant. There-
fore, the modular automorphism group of ϕ|B(N⊂M,ϕ)is given by the restriction σϕ|B(N⊂M,ϕ).
Since/bardblunϕu∗
n−ψ/bardbl →0, the isomorphism βmust be state-preserving and βintertwines σϕand
σψ.
Finally recall that E:M→Ngives rise to a canonical embedding c(N)⊂c(M) of the
continuous cores. The following is a version of Theorem Afor inclusions.
Theorem 4.3. LetNbe a factor of type III 1andN⊂Man inclusion with faithful normal
conditional expectation E:M→N. Assume that M∗is separable. Let ωbe a free ultraﬁlter
onN. Consider the following statements.
1.Madmits a faithful normal state that is ergodic and E-invariant, i.e. Serg(M,E)/\e}atio\slash=∅.
2.Serg(M,E)is a denseGδsubset of S1(M,E).
3.B(N⊂M,ϕ)σϕ=C1for some (or equivalently all) ϕ∈S(M,E).
4.c(N)⊂c(M)is irreducible.
Then statements 1, 2 and 3 are equivalent and they imply statem ent 4.
Remark 4.4. In[Mar23], it is conjectured that 4 ⇒3, so that conjecturally all statements
in Theorem 4.3are equivalent. Moreover in [Mar23, Corollary 8.16] , it is proven that this
conjecture is true whenever Nitself has trivial bicentralizer. The latter is known for la rge
families of type III 1factors, including the amenable type III 1factor and all almost periodic
type III 1factors.
Remark 4.5. A necessary condition for theirreducibility of c(N)⊂c(M) is that (N′∩M)σϕ=
C1 forϕ∈S(M,E). But this is far from being a suﬃcient condition. Indeed, gi ven any type
III1factorNand given any ergodic action R /archrightd⋊wnζPofRon a II 1factorP, we consider the
trace scaling action R /archrightd⋊wnθc(N). Sinceθ⊗ζis a trace scaling action of the II ∞factorc(N)⊗P,
we have that M= (c(N)⊗P)θ⊗ζis a III 1factor with continuous core c(M) =c(N)⊗P. Then
N∼=N⊗1 is a von Neumann subalgebra of Mand id⊗τdeﬁnes a conditional expectation of
MontoN. Viewingc(M) asc(N)⊗P, we ﬁnd that c(N)′∩c(M)∼=P. SinceN⊂c(N) is
irreducible and ζis ergodic, also N⊂Mis irreducible, but c(N)⊂c(M) is not irreducible.
Proof of Theorem 4.3.We start by proving the nontrivial implication 3 ⇒2. Note that by the
discussion preceding the theorem, statement 3 is independe nt of the choice of ϕ∈S(M,E).
Fixϕ∈S(M,E) and assume that B(N⊂M,ϕ)σϕ=C1. Consider the von Neumann algebra
Mω,ϕwith its faithful normal tracial state ϕω. We claim that
Mϕ⊂Mω,ϕ
∪ ∪
C1⊂(Nω,ϕ)′∩Mω,ϕ
is a commuting square. To prove this claim, take x∈(Nω,ϕ)′∩Mω,ϕand writey=EMϕ(x).
We have to prove that y∈C1.
10Representxby the bounded sequence ( xn)n∈Nsatisfying lim n→ω/bardblxnϕ−ϕxn/bardbl= 0. Letz=
limn→ωxnweakly. Since xnϕ→zϕandϕxn→ϕzweakly, it follows that zϕ=ϕz. So,
z∈Mϕand we conclude that z=y. By[AHHM18, Proposition 3.3] ,xbelongs to the
Ocneanu ultrapower of B(N⊂M,ϕ). This implies that z∈B(N⊂M,ϕ). Sincez∈Mϕand
B(N⊂M,ϕ)σϕ=C1, it follows that z∈C1. So,y∈C1 and the claim is proven.
By the claim, for every x∈Mϕwithϕ(x) = 0, we have that E(Nω,ϕ)′∩Mω,ϕ(x) = 0. For every
ε>0, Popa’s local quantization [Pop92, Theorem A.1.2] provides a ﬁnite dimensional abelian
von Neumann subalgebra A⊂Nω,ϕsuch that /bardblEA′∩Mω,ϕ(x)/bardblϕω≤ε. We can then repeat the
proof of Theorem Aand obtain that 2 holds.
The implications 2 ⇒1⇒3 are trivial. To conclude the proof, we show 1 ⇒4. Fixϕ∈
Serg(M,E) and write c(M) =M⋊σϕR. We have seen in the proof of Lemma 2.1thatL(R)′∩
c(M) =L(R). Therefore, c(N)′∩c(M)⊂c(N), which forces c(N)⊂c(M) to be irreducible,
becausec(N) is a factor.
Open problem 4.6. Two potential generalizations of Theorem Bare open and related to
Theorem A.
•Under which conditions, actions of amenable, locally compact, noncompact groups on II 1
factors admit ergodic cocycle perturbations?
•Under which conditions, amenable group actions on arbitrar y factors admit ergodic cocycle
perturbations?
Assume that Gis a locally compact abelian group and that G/archrightd⋊wnαMis an action on a factor
Msuch that for all g∈G\{e}, the automorphism αgis outer. A necessary condition for αto
admit an ergodic cocycle perturbation is that the crossed pr oductM⋊αGis a factor. Indeed,
ifv∈ C(α) is a 1-cocycle such that β= Adv◦αis ergodic, we have M⋊βG∼=M⋊αG. Also,
L(G)′∩M⋊βG⊂L(G), by the ergodicity of β. Since the map g/mapsto→βgis faithful, it then
follows that M⋊βGis a factor.
On the other hand, the outerness of the individual automorph ismsαg,g/\e}atio\slash=e, is not suﬃcient to
guarantee that M⋊αGis a factor. For instance, an obvious modiﬁcation of [MV22, Example
8]provides an action of Ron the hyperﬁnite II 1factorMby outer automorphisms such that
M⋊Ris not a factor.
Recall that an action of a locally compact group Gon a factor Mis called strictly outer if
M′∩M⋊G=C1. ThenM⋊Gobviously is a factor. A more precise version of the ﬁrst
question above would therefore be: does every strictly oute r action of an amenable, locally
compact, noncompact group Gon a II 1factorMadmit an ergodic cocycle perturbation?
Thesecondquestionaboveseemstobeevenmorediﬃcult. Whil eitisconceivablethatavariant
of Theorem Bcan be proven for state preserving actions of countable groups, we have no idea
what happens for general automorphisms and automorphism gr oups of arbitrary factors.
