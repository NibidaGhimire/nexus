Abstract
In many applications, knowledge of the sound pressure transfer to the eardrum is important. The
transfer is highly inuenced by the shape of the ear canal and its acoustic properties, such as the
acoustic impedance at the eardrum. Invasive procedures to measure the sound pressure at the eardrum
are usually elaborate or costly. In this work, we propose a numerical method to estimate the transfer
impedance at the eardrum given only input impedance measurements at the ear canal entrance by using
one-dimensional rst-order nite elements and Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm. Estimations on
the area function of the ear canal and the acoustic impedance at the eardrum are achieved. Results
are validated through numerical simulations on ten dierent ear canal geometries and three dierent
acoustic impedances at the eardrum using synthetically generated data from three-dimensional nite
element simulations.
1 Introduction
Humans have individually shaped ear canals which will individually inuence the sound transfer from the
ear canal entrance to the eardrum. In many applications such as hearing aids or insert earphones, one is
interested in the sound pressure at the eardrum, however, it is often not practical to measure it directly.
Therefore, it is desirable to be able to individually predict the eardrum sound pressure from measurements
at the entrance to the ear canal. One possibility is to measure the acoustic impedance, i.e., the ratio of sound
pressure and volume velocity, at the entrance of the ear canal. The goal is then to estimate the transfer
impedance, i.e., the ratio of the eardrum sound pressure to the volume velocity at the entrance, because
one can then use input and transfer impedances together with a source model to individually predict the
eardrum pressure, see e.g. [1].
A useful one-dimensional equation to study this behavior is Webster's horn equation [2], describing the
sound pressure in a horn, i.e., a tube with varying diameter. In order to solve Webster's equation for
the sound pressure at dierent positions along the ear canal, an area function which describes the area
along the ear canal is needed. If three-dimensional ear canal geometries are given, a curved center axis
and an associated area function can be computed, using for instance the method proposed by [3]. In most
cases, such data is, however, not available. Alternatively, area functions can be estimated from acoustic
impedances or reectances measured at the entrance of the individual ear canal.
In a number of publications, the phase of the reectance was used to estimate the transfer impedance and
area function [4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8]. As an example, in [4] the optimization was done by an electro-acoustic model
and a gradient method to approximate the radius function for a measured (or simulated) input reectance.
Given reference pressure values at the eardrum, the pressure was transformed back to the entrance for
individual ear canals. A chain matrix, optimized using reectance data then lead to accurate results for the
radius function and the pressure at the drum for frequencies up to 16 kHz.
Another approach using a reectance-based method was considered in [5] where the aim was to reproduce
the ear canal cross-sectional area. Specically, a time-domain reectance was calculated and the inverse
solution to the time-domain horn equation was formulated in terms of forward and backward traveling
pressure waves to obtain the area function by using a nite dierence approximation. The solution to the
inverse problem was analyzed for innite acoustic horns in [9]. In [5] the area function of the inverse solution
was applied to measurements made in an ear simulator. The estimated ear canal area function was close to
1arXiv:2304.07131v1  [math.OC]  14 Apr 2023the one of the simulator. Furthermore, the authors estimated the ear canal area function from reectance
measurements on real subjects, assuming the eardrum to be rigid, although the true ear canal area functions
were not known. The resulting ear canal area functions looked plausible and similar to other ear canal area
functions from the literature. The transfer impedance, however, was not investigated.
In this paper, we present a dierent approach based on data of the input impedance in the frequency domain.
Working in the frequency domain appears to be more convenient with respect to actual measurement data
(i.e., acoustic impedances or reectances) whose validity will in general be limited to a certain frequency
range. Our aim is to estimate the transfer impedance of the individual residual ear canal. To this end,
we parameterize the ear canal area function and the acoustic impedance of the eardrum. We solve the
horn equation in the frequency domain with linear nite elements and optimize the parameters using the
Nelder-Mead method [10] with respect to given data of the input impedance. By doing so, we also obtain
estimations of the ear canal area function and the acoustic impedance at the eardrum.
The general idea of the method is described in section 2. The generation of data as input and for validation
purposes is explained in section 3. In section 4 the procedure from section 2 will be extended by several
adjustments to avoid unrealistic results during the parameter tting. The nal version of our method is
validated in section 5 on a variety of ear canal geometries with dierent eardrum impedance models. Finally,
in section 6 conclusions are given.
A MATLAB implementation of the complete method can be found in the supplementary material [11].1
2 Method
The main goal of our method is to estimate the transfer impedance Ztr, based on data of the input impedance
Zin;data, for individual ear canals. To do this, we use Webster's horn equation [2] in the frequency domain
as surrogate model of a simplied representation of the pressure distribution in the ear canal,

in turn is modeled by Zin=p(0)

acoustic impedance Zdat the eardrum are unknown. In the following, these quantities are parameterized
and tted to the given data of the input impedance by minimizing the cost function

the weighted sum of the squared dierences between model and data of the logarithmic amplitude and the
phase in radians. Zin;data(f) denotes the given data, i.e., the input impedance from the measurement at the

and the parameters Qi,f0;iandL0;iare the quality factor, the resonance frequency and the impedance
level at resonance (in dB re 1 Pa s/m3), respectively. This model is a good compromise between the number
of parameters and approximation as compared to more sophisticated models like the model by [13]. It is
notably capable of modeling the cadaver measurements of [14] with acceptable accuracy.
Following the suggestion by [15], the innermost part of the ear canal is modeled as a lumped compliance (of
a right circular cone of 4 mm length and 2.5 mm radius) acting in parallel with the eardrum impedance,

ZEDcorresponds to the acoustic impedance at the eardrum, cis the speed of sound and Vis the volume of

The parameters used in the denitions of the area function, i.e., S(x) in (3) and the acoustic impedance of
the eardrum Zdin (6), were tted using the Nelder-Mead constrained optimization procedure [10, 16]. To
this end, equations (1a)-(1c) were solved numerically by a self-implemented nite-element code in MATLAB
using linear basis functions and the Simpson quadrature rule to compute the integrals. For this, equation
(1a) was multiplied by a test function u(x) and integrated over the interval [0 ;`]. Changing the signs and
integrating by parts lead to the so called weak formulation

To discretize this problem we divided the interval into smaller intervals [ xn 1;xn] withxn=n`

i.e., the discretization is dierent for each frequency. In this case the typical "rule of thumb" of 10 elements
per wave length is guaranteed. Additionally for the case of the horn equation, the discretization error with
respect to a the magnitude and phase seems to be uniformly bounded, see gure 1. The discretization error
was computed with respect to a reference solution with Nref= 5000 elements.

3 Data
The synthetically generated input impedance and validation data were created by 3D nite-element sim-
ulations on geometries from the IHA database [17, 18]. For the simulation, the STL geometry was cut at
the rst bend of the ear canal. The rst bend was determined by computing the center axis of the ear
canal using the VMTK toolbox [19]. Then, the coordinates with highest curvature of this center axis in the
region of the rst bend, which can be visually estimated, was evaluated using the MATLAB function of [20].
The implementation by [21] was used to shape the entrance surface with respect to the coordinates of the
rst bend and the corresponding tangential vectors. This modied geometry was used in [22], where the
geometries were discretized in a tetrahedral mesh with approximately 70,000-100,000 degrees of freedom,
which corresponds to a maximum edge length of 1 mm of an element. The meshes at the eardrum were
rened further with maximum edge length of 0.2 mm. As example, the meshed ear canal from subject 5 is
illustrated in gure 3.
The entrance surface was then assumed to vibrate piston-like to provide the excitation of the residual ear
canal. Using this set-up, acoustic input impedances for three dierent types of impedances at the eardrum
were computed at the entrance, by solving the Helmholtz equation,

We began with the basic algorithm and M= 4, i.e., four sine and cosine summands in the denition
of the area function S(x) in (3). The parameter tting was done with a subset of all available frequencies,
more specically with 25 logarithmically distributed frequencies in the range from 100 Hz to 20 kHz. The
parameter constraints were set according to table 2 to ensure that the area function S(x) does not take
excessive values, the oscillations of the area function are not unreasonably large and the impedance mag-
nitude at the eardrum corresponds approximately to the expectations from commonly used models (i) and
(ii) as in gure 4. To enhance the accuracy, the Nelder-Mead method was used with three restarts, taking
the result of the preceding optimization as initialization. Since the Nelder-Mead optimization procedure
does not guarantee convergence to a global minimum, the parameter tting procedure was executed several
times with dierent initial parameters. These were chosen as random perturbation of up to 25 % from the

basic set of parameters, also depicted in table 2, i.e., for a given parameter with basic value 0,
init=0(1 + 0:25U( 1;1));
whereU( 1;1) is the uniform distribution over the interval (  1;1). In total, twelve dierent initial param-
eter sets were considered. Figure 5 shows the results obtained with all twelve sets of initial parameters,
considering data generated from the geometry of subject 5 and eardrum impedance model (ii). All twelve
initial parameter sets converged to similar results, thus the lines for each model type are very close to each
other. The area function S(x) has a similar trend in comparison to the area function computed by the
method of [3] which is depicted as data curve in gure 5. The input impedance is tted well over the whole
frequency range and even for the transfer impedance only slight dierences between data and model can be
observed.
However, this original parameter tting did not lead to comparably good results for all subjects and all
dierent types of eardrum impedances. To enhance the robustness of the method, several aspects that lead
to problems or unrealistic results for individual subjects and eardrum impedance models are considered in
the following and possible solution strategies are discussed, implemented and illustrated.
4.1 Avoiding negative areas
For some initial parameter sets, the original parameter tting procedure returns a parameter set where the
corresponding area function S(x) takes negative values for some part in the interval [0 ;`]. Even though the
reference data, i.e., the input impedance, was matched reasonably well, see gure 6, some larger dierences
can be observed for the transfer impedance. We also note that the initial parameter set largely inuences
the result, thus the method is not very robust with regard to the initialization. Two possible strategies to
prevent negative area function are
(1) further restriction on the parameters S0;cmandsmsuch that the area function Swill always be
positive,
(2) adding a penalty term to the cost function that penalizes negative or small values of S.
Here the rst strategy is not very practical. It leads to strong restrictions on S0in the way that the lower
bound needs to be relatively large or the restrictions on cmandsmare such that admissible geometries are
quite restricted.
The second strategy still keeps a lot of freedom in the geometry-related parameters and will be used in the
following. The penalty term is chosen as

wherekk1is the discrete supremum norm. This penalty term penalizes the area function becoming smaller
thanH(1). We choose H(1)= 10 5m2, which is about one half of the base area of the standard cone with
a radius of 2.5 mm.
The updated procedure now usually generates functions that are positive on [0 ;`]. If the area still becomes
negative then the model-data mist is probably just too large and a meaningful parameter tting is not pos-
sible with the underlying one-dimensional surrogate model (1a)-(1c) or the initial values were chosen poorly.

Occasionally the problem arises that the area function steeply increases after reaching the minimum.
One case for this behavior is illustrated in gure 7a. This is anatomically at least unusual. Therefore,
another penalty term is applied that penalizes solutions in which the end of the ear canal is larger than the
overall minimum or close to that minimum. This additional penalty term is given as

The penalty is chosen as H(2)= 0 which enforces the minimum of the area function to be at the end of the
8ear canal. The cost function now becomes
J=J0+J1;H(1)+J2;H(2): (16)
Using the updated cost function Jin the parameter tting leads to more realistic ear canal area functions,
see gure 7b.
4.2 Accomodating long and short ear canals
The length of the ear canal varies for each individual, thus the bounds of `are chosen as 15 mm `45 mm
to be able to model short and long ear canals. Arbitrary initial values for `may, however, lead the Nelder-
Mead algorithm converge to a local minimum with an inadequate result for the value of `, as can be seen in
gure 7b. To avoid this, we estimate `in a rst step by looking at the rst maximum of the input impedance
magnitude of the data, see for example gure 6b at around 8 kHz. Assuming a rigidly terminated cylindrical
waveguide, the initial length is estimated as
`est=c
2fmax; (17)
wherefmaxcorresponds to the frequency where the rst maximum of the input impedance magnitude, i.e.,
the data, is achieved. It turned out that in general the rst maximum frequency gave a better result than
the rst minimum, which is why the length was estimated using equation (17). The ear canal is not a rigidly
terminated cylindrical waveguide, but still this is a reasonable rst approximation. Using this estimated
`estas initial parameter leads to more appropriate results in the numerical simulations. To ensure that the
overall length does not vary much from this estimated initial length during the parameter tting, the bounds
for`were redened to `est 3 mm``est+ 1 mm. The upper bound is stricter since the impedance
model already assumes that the ear canal is longer due to the cone at the end representing the innermost
part of the ear canal. These bounds lead to reasonable results for most initial values, see gure 7c. Further
results using the rened method are discussed in the validation in section 5.
In the following subsection we further discuss the inuence of the chosen frequency set for the parameter
tting and the inuence of the length of the expansion of the area function.
4.3 Inuence of the bandwidth and frequency spacing used in the parameter
tting
While the improvements of the prior subsections lead to better results in the parameter tting, in some
cases problems arise at very high frequencies, because some features of the 3D geometry cannot be captured
in a one-dimensional model. This means that not for all ear canal shapes good estimations on the transfer
impedance for frequencies up to 20 kHz can be expected. An example is illustrated in gure 8. Here, the
minimum of the magnitude of the input impedance at approximately 17 kHz is much lower than usual. For
this individual, good approximations for high frequencies cannot be achieved using the horn equation. It
might therefore be useful to restrict the frequency range during the parameter tting to get better results
regarding the lower frequency part. Restricting the frequency range to frequencies smaller than 10 kHz lead
to improvements in the input impedance Zinand transfer impedance Ztrfrom the parameter tting, see
gure 9.
In the following, dierent choices for frequency subsets are considered. The considered frequency sets
were either uniformly or logarithmically distributed (rounded up to the nearest 100 Hz). Figure 10 illustrates
the validation for uniformly distributed frequencies where the magnitude and phase dierence of the transfer
impedance was computed with respect to the reference data. For some frequency sets, ner resolutions in the
low frequency range (up to 3 kHz) or the higher frequency range (larger than 3 kHz) were used. Dierent
upper limits were also considered, where the frequency sets were restricted either to frequencies up to
20 kHz or 10 kHz for reasons discussed above. Additionally, for some frequency sets F, the frequencies that
correspond to the maxima and minima of the input impedance magnitude were included, because these are
the frequencies where usually the largest error with respect to the data is made and these frequencies are
characteristic for the specic ear canal shape. We could observe that the frequency set using logarithmic
distribution while additionally including the frequencies corresponding to the maxima and minima of the
magnitude of the input impedance results in comparably low function values for the specic frequency range
with respect to the validation function

Improvements in the lower frequency range, especially up to 8 kHz can be observed in comparison to gure
8.
Although other congurations lead to comparable validation function values, plotting the actual dierence
of the magnitude in dB over the frequency showed that for low frequencies the versions using uniformly dis-
tributed frequencies result in slightly worse behavior in the low frequency range with magnitude dierences
of up to 3 dB in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 6 kHz, see gure 10 as example, while the logarithmically
distributed frequencies only lead to magnitude dierences of up to 1.5 dB in this frequency range. This case
is discussed and illustrated in the validation in section 5. Consequently, a logarithmic distributed frequency
set with maxima and minima frequencies was the choice for the validation in section 5.
Since usually frequencies smaller than 10 kHz are especially of interest, we restrict the frequencies to
10 kHz to improve the results in this range, especially if the pressure distribution in the ear canal exhibits
large three-dimensional eects due to the geometry of the ear canal.

tional cost in the following experiments M= 4 was chosen as a reasonable compromise between accuracy
and computational cost.

data sets, i.e., 10 dierent subjects and three dierent impedance models at the eardrum, in total.
The parameter tting was done for twelve initial parameter sets in all cases. Only the one with the
lowest cost function over all 200 frequencies was kept. The results are illustrated in gure 12. In this case
the results show magnitude dierences of less than 1 dB for all frequencies in the range of up to 7 kHz,
and still magnitude dierences smaller than 5 dB for frequencies between 7 kHz and 10 kHz. In most cases
the magnitude dierence is even smaller than 3 dB for frequencies up to 10 kHz. For larger frequencies
the dierences are very large since only frequencies up to 10 kHz were used in the parameter tting. Note
however, that for most geometries reasonable results were also achieved for higher frequencies, see gure 13.
5.2 Ear canal area function
During the parameter tting, the estimated parameters for the ear canal area function can be used to
construct an area function to get an approximate model of the geometry.

In gure 14 area functions taken from the parameter tting (using logarthmically distributed frequencies
up to 10 kHz) are displayed comparing it with the area function computed from the 3D geometry using the
method described in [3]. Main features for most ear canals could be reproduced reasonably well. Note that
the geometry used for the generation of the data was cut at the rst bend of the center axis obtained from
using the VMTK toolbox. This center axis diers from the one proposed by [3]. Especially the entrance
13surface will not be perpendicular to the center axis by [3] which explains the large deviations at the entrance
of the area function for some subjects like subject 3 and subject 9. Overall, the approximations from the
parameter tting are quite close to the area function generated with the method from [3]. The area functions
are also largely unaected by the impedance model used for the data generation.

The parameter tting also lead to an approximation of the impedance at the eardrum. This is illustrated
in gure 15. The data of the two-resonator model (ii) can be reconstructed well since this is the impedance
model we used in the parameter tting. The model by [13] is approximated well in the low frequency range.
The impedance condition (iii) could not be approximated well since the bounds on the parameters do not
allow impedances of such high magnitude. However, one can observe that the magnitude is larger than in
the other cases, such that the resulting parameter tting is closer to the rigid case. In all cases, the true
eardrum impedance had a larger magnitude than the estimated one at frequencies above 2 kHz.
6 Conclusion
In this paper a method to estimate the transfer impedance from input impedance is described and validated.
Using synthetically generated data the method produces accurate results, especially in the frequency range
of 100 Hz to 7 kHz. We can furthermore estimate the ear canal area function and the eardrum impedance,
where for the area function the main features of the geometry were recognized. The eardrum impedance
was estimated well in the low frequency range if the underlying impedance model was tting. For higher
frequencies, however, the eardrum impedance estimation was underestimated in general.
Future work should involve the validation and enhancement of the method using in vivo measurements.
