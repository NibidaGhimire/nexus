Abstract —This paper studies integrated sensing and commu-
nication (ISAC) in the downlink of a cell-free massive multi ple-
input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multi-static sen sing
and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) use rs.
We propose a successive convex approximation-based power a llo-
cation algorithm that maximizes energy efﬁciency while sat isfying
the sensing and URLLC requirements. In addition, we provide a
new deﬁnition for network availability, which accounts for both
sensing and URLLC requirements. The impact of blocklength,
sensing requirement, and required reliability as a functio n of
decoding error probability on network availability and ene rgy ef-
ﬁciency is investigated. The proposed power allocation alg orithm
is compared to a communication-centric approach where only the
URLLC requirement is considered. It is shown that the URLLC-
only approach is incapable of meeting sensing requirements ,
while the proposed ISAC algorithm fulﬁlls both sensing and
URLLC requirements, albeit with an associated increase in
energy consumption. This increment can be reduced up to 75%
by utilizing additional symbols for sensing. It is also demo nstrated
that larger blocklengths enhance network availability and offer
greater robustness against stringent reliability require ments.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) aims to en-
hance spectral/hardware efﬁciency and is expected to enabl e
various use cases for autonomous vehicles, smart factories , and
other location/environment-aware scenarios in 6G communi -
cation networks [1], [2]. Ultra-reliable low-latency comm uni-
cation (URLLC) is required in most of these use cases such as
industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) and vehicle-to-eve rything
(V2X) communications. In a V2X network, an ISAC system
can detect targets of interest, such as pedestrians and vehi cles,
and deliver sensing information reliably with a minimal del ay
for URLLC users such as autonomous vehicles [3]. Therefore,
studying both technologies together is vital to enable miss ion-
critical applications in future wireless networks.
To the best of our knowledge, there are few works that
jointly consider URLLC and ISAC. In [3], a joint precoding
scheme is proposed to minimize transmit power, satisfying
sensing and delay requirements. Moreover, joint ISAC beam-
forming and scheduling design is addressed in [4] for period ic

ISAC base station, while cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-
input multiple-output) with multiple distributed access p oints
(APs) has been shown to facilitate URLLC [5]–[7] and ISAC
[8], [9] implementations. This motivates us to study the int er-
play between URLLC and ISAC in cell-free massive MIMO
systems. Speciﬁcally, we aim to address the power allocatio n
problem so that both sensing and URLLC requirements are
satisﬁed. For most URLLC applications, such as V2X and
IIoT, short codewords are needed to satisfy latency constra ints
where codes with short blocklengths, e.g., 100 symbols are
employed. Therefore, the ﬁnite blocklength regime needs to
be considered to model decoding error probability (DEP) [5] ,
[10], [11]. In such applications, short data packets should be
delivered with a minimum reliability of 99.999% and an end-
to-end (E2E) delay of less than 10-150 ms [12], [13].
In this paper, we study a cell-free massive MIMO system
with URLLC user equipments (UEs) and multi-static sensing
in a cluttered environment. Both sensing and communication
signals contribute to the sensing task. However, the sensin g
signals can cause interference for the UEs. Thus, we design t he
precoding vectors to null the interference only for the UEs. We
consider a maximum DEP threshold, representing the reliabi l-
ity requirement, together with a maximum transmission dela y
threshold as the URLLC requirements. Moreover, a minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is consi dered as
the sensing requirement. This is motivated by the fact that
given a ﬁxed false alarm probability, detection probabilit y
increases with a higher sensing SINR [14], [15, Chap. 3
and 15]. Our aim is to maximize the energy efﬁciency (EE)
of downlink transmission. This involves minimizing power
consumption for a given blocklength in line with URRLC
requirements. The main contributions of this paper are as
follows:
•We derive an upper bound for the DEP and transmis-
sion delay in ﬁnite blocklength cell-free massive MIMO
communications.
•We propose a power allocation design approach, called
SeURLLC+ , which maximizes EE while satisfying ISAC
and URLLC requirements with dedicated sensing sym-
bols coherently transmitted from ISAC APs. We cast
the non-convex optimization problem in a form that
facilitates the utilization of the Feasible Point Pursuit -Successive Convex Approximation (FPP-SCA) [16].
•We present a new deﬁnition of network availability
accounting for both ISAC and URLLC requirements in
the ﬁnite blocklength regime. We quantify this network
availability by checking the feasibility of the proposed
FPP-SCA-based algorithm.
•We investigate the impact of blocklength, sensing SINR
threshold, and DEP threshold on network availability
and EE by comparing the performance of the proposed
power allocation algorithm with two benchmarks: i)
URLLC-only , representing a power allocation algorithm
which aims to maximize EE by taking into account only
URLLC requirements; ii) SeURLLC , which represents the
proposed power allocation algorithm without dedicated
sensing symbols.
II. S YSTEM MODEL
We consider an ISAC cell-free massive MIMO system
in URLLC scenarios. The system adopts a centralized ra-
dio access network (C-RAN) architecture [17] for uplink
channel estimation and downlink communication, as well as
multi-static sensing as in [14] where more than two APs
are involved in sensing. All the APs are connected through
fronthaul links to the edge cloud and are fully synchronized .
We consider the original form of cell-free massive MIMO
[5], where all the NtxISAC APs jointly serve the Nue
URLLC UEs by transmitting precoded signals containing
both communication and sensing symbols. Meanwhile, the
Nrxsensing receive APs simultaneously sense the candi-
date location to detect if there is any object of interest.
Each AP is equipped with an array of Mantennas ar-
ranged in a horizontal uniform linear array (ULA) with half-
wavelength spacing. The respective array response vector i s
a(ϕ,ϑ) =/bracketleftbig
1ejπsin(ϕ)cos(ϑ)... ej(M−1)πsin(ϕ)cos(ϑ)/bracketrightbigT,
whereϕandϑare the azimuth and elevation angles from the
AP to the target location, respectively [18].
We consider narrowband communications and the ﬁnite
blocklength regime for URLLC UEs, where a packet of bibits
is sent to UE iwithin a transmission block with blocklength
L=Lp+Ldsymbols using the coherence bandwidth B.
LpandLdare the number of symbols for pilot and data,
respectively. It is expected that duration of each URLLC
transmission, denoted by T, is shorter than one coherence time
Tc, i.e.,T <Tc[7]. However, without loss of generality, we
assumeT=Tcso that we estimate the channel for each
transmission.
The communication channels are modeled as spatially cor-
related Rician fading which are assumed to remain constant
during each coherence block, and the channel realizations a re
independent of each other. Let hi,k∈CMdenote the channel
between ISAC AP kand UEi, modeled as
hi,k=ejψi,k¯hi,k+˜hi,k, (1)
which consists of a semi-deterministic line-of-sight (LoS ) path,
represented by ejψi,k¯hi,kwith unknown phase-shift ψi,k∼
U[0,2π)(uniformly distributed on [0,2π)), and a stochasticnon-line-of-sight (NLoS) component ˜hi,k∼CN(0,˜Ri,k)with
the spatial correlation matrix ˜Ri,k. The¯hi,kand˜Ri,kinclude
the combined effect of geometric path loss and shadowing. We

A. Multi-Static Sensing
We consider multi-static sensing where multiple distribut ed
transmit and receive APs are involved. The network senses
the target location during downlink phase. We assume there
is a LoS connection between the target location and each
transmit/receive AP. In the presence of the target, each re-
ceive AP receives the reﬂected signals from the target, as
well as, undesired signals, known as clutter. The clutter is
independent of the presence of the target and can be consider ed
as interference for sensing. However, thanks to the C-RAN
architecture, the LoS signals between transmit and receive APs
are known and can be cancelled out at the edge cloud, since the
transmitted signals and the AP locations are known. Therefo re,the interference signals correspond only to the reﬂected pa ths
through the obstacles and are henceforth referred to as targ et-
free channels.
LetHr,k∈CM×Mdenote the target-free channel matrix
between transmit AP kand receive AP r. We use the correlated
Rayleigh fading model for the NLoS channels Hr,k, which is
modeled using the Kronecker model [14]. We deﬁne the ran-
dom matrix Wch,(r,k)∈CM×Mwith independent and identi-
cally distributed (i.i.d.) entries with CN(0,1)distribution. The
matrix Rrx,(r,k)∈CM×Mrepresents the spatial correlation
matrix corresponding to receive AP rand with respect to the
direction of transmit AP k. Similarly, Rtx,(r,k)∈CM×Mis
the spatial correlation matrix corresponding to transmit A Pk
and with respect to the direction of receive AP r. Then, the

secutiveLdsymbols collected for sensing. Each receive AP

The communication and sensing transmit precoding vectors
are obtained based on regularized zero forcing (RZF) and

assignment algorithm in [17, Algorithm 4.1].

III. R ELIABILITY AND DELAY ANALYSIS FOR URLLC
In this section, we derive an upper bound on the DEP and
the transmission delay which are considered as the URLLC
requirements. In the ﬁnite blocklength regime, the commu-
nication data cannot be transmitted without error. From [6] ,
ergodic data rate of UE ican be approximated as

IV. P OWER ALLOCATION AND NETWORK AVAILABILITY
A. Power Allocation Algorithm
We propose a power allocation algorithm that aims to
maximize EE while satisfying the per-AP power constraints
along with the URLLC and sensing requirements. We have
numerically shown in [9] and [14], that maximizing the
sensing SINR improves the target detection probability und er a
constant false alarm probability. When studying other sens ing
tasks, it is naturally desired to keep the sensing SINR above
a required threshold. Motivated by this fact, the optimizat ion
problem can be cast as
maximize

SINRs≥γs, (21c)
Pk≤Ptx, k = 1,···,Ntx (21d)
whereǫth= max{ǫth
i|∀i}is the maximum DEP threshold. In
fact, we use ǫthto compute the average transmission time in(18), instead of using the individual DEP for each UE. This
gives us a lower bound on the average EE as in (21a) where
Ptotal=/summationtextNtx
k=1Pkis the average total power consumption.
Due to the unit-power centralized precoding vectors, Ptotal=/summationtextNue

should be selected according to the sensing task and other

Given that the total number of information bits, i.e.,/summationtextNue
i=1bi, the bandwidth B, the blocklength L, and the max-
imum DEP ǫthare constant, maximizing the lower bound of
EEis equivalent to minimizing the total power consumption
from all ISAC transmit APs.
According to (17), the reliability constraints in (21b) can be
written as communication SINR constraints in the form

whereγc,iis the SINR threshold for UE iwhich is a

Using (7), the sensing constraints in (21c) are expressed as
ρT(γsB−A)ρ≤−γsLdMNrxσ2
n, (25)
which is not convex. To handle this non-convexity, we use
FPP-SCA method [16]. To avoid any potential infeasibility
issue during the initial iterations of the algorithm, we add
slack variable χ≥0and a slack penalty to the convexiﬁed
problem at each iteration. However, to have the fully satisﬁ ed
constraints, the slack variable should be zero at the end. Th us,
we set the slack variable to zero in the next iterations if the y
are lower than a threshold denoted by ǫχ>0. Thus, the
sensing constraints at the (c+1)thiteration of the FPP-SCA
algorithm are

whereρ(c)is the optimal solution found at the cthiteration.
Then, the convex problem that is solved at the (c+ 1)th

B. Network Availability
Network availability is a performance metric that measures
the probability of providing the required quality of servic e
(QoS) for UEs. However, this metric is relative and can vary
for ISAC systems. For example, in sensing-based mission-
critical applications, sensing performance plays a crucia l role
in serving URLLC UEs. Hence, we deﬁne the network avail-
ability as the probability that reliability and delay requi rements
for URLLC, as well as a minimum SINR for sensing are
satisﬁed.
We calculate network availability using Monte Carlo sim-
ulations to compute the probability that the transmit power
coefﬁcients, obtained from our proposed power allocation
algorithm, satisfy all constraints including URLLC, sensi ng,
and per-AP power constraints, i.e., the problem is feasible .
V. N UMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we present numerical results to evaluate th e
performance of the proposed power allocation algorithm. Th e
Ntx= 16 ISAC transmit APs are uniformly distributed in an
area of 500 m×500m. The sensing location is in the center
of the area, i.e., (250,250) . The number of antenna elements
per AP isM= 4. TheNrx= 2 receive APs are located
close to the sensing location at (200,250) and(300,250) . We
consider a total of Nue= 8 URLLC UEs in the network. We
setPtx= 100 mW and the uplink pilot transmission power is
50mW.
The large-scale fading coefﬁcients, shadowing parameters ,
probability of LoS, and the Rician factors are simulated bas ed
on the 3GPP Urban Microcell model, deﬁned in [20, Table
B.1.2.1-1, Table B.1.2.1-2, Table B.1.2.2.1-4]. The path l oss
for the Rayleigh fading target-free channels is also modele d
by the 3GPP Urban Microcell model with the difference that
the channel gains are multiplied by an additional scaling
parameter equal to 0.3to suppress the known parts of the
target-free channels due to the permanent obstacles [14]. T he
sensing channel gains are computed by the bi-static radar ra nge
equation [15] with σrcs= 0dBsm . The RCS of the targetFig. 1: Network availability vs. blocklength.
is modeled by the Swerling-I model. The carrier frequency,
the bandwidth, and the noise variance are set to 1.9GHz,
200KHz, and−114dBm, respectively. The number of pilot
symbols is Lp= 10 . The spatial correlation matrices for
the communication channels are generated by using the local
scattering model in [17, Sec. 2.5.3]. For all the UEs, we
set the same packet size, the maximum transmission delay,
and the DEP threshold to bi= 256 bits,D(th)
i= 1ms, and
ǫth= 10−5, respectively. In the proposed algorithm, we set
ǫ= 10−3,ǫχ= 10−6,λ= 10 , andcmax= 50 .
We compare the performance of the proposed power allo-
cation algorithm, i.e., SeURLLC+ , with two benchmarks: i)
URLLC-only , corresponding to a power allocation algorithm
which maximizes EE for URLLC without considering sensing
requirements, and ii) SeURLLC , which represents the proposed
power allocation algorithm without additional sensing sym -
bols.
Fig. 1 shows the network availability versus the blocklengt h
for two sensing SINR thresholds: 3dB and10dB. Generally,
the network availability increases with larger blocklengt hs but
decreases when sensing is integrated, particularly when on ly
communication symbols are employed. Notably, the URLLC-
only algorithm could not provide any sensing capability,
highlighting the need for new power allocation algorithms t o
enable sensing in such systems. However, for both sensing
requirements ( 3dB and10dB), the network availability with
the proposed algorithm can approach the one of URLLC-only
with ignoring sensing in the system, only when additional
sensing symbols are employed. The SeURLLC+ achieves
network availability over 0.9 when the blocklength is at lea st
140 symbols and reaches 0.99 when L= 180 .
Fig. 2 demonstrates the impact of blocklength on EE for
two sensing SINR thresholds ( 3dB and10dB). The URLLC-
only algorithm is most energy-efﬁcient, but it could not meet
the sensing requirement (as in Fig. 1). Increasing blocklen gth
enhances the EE of URLLC-only . In contrast, the EE for the
proposed algorithm, both with and without sensing symbols,
experiences a slight decrease with increasing blocklength . This
phenomenon occurs due to the interplay between blocklength
and total power, as power consumption is inherently linked t oFig. 2: Energy efﬁciency vs. blocklength.

blocklength. Moreover, smaller sensing SINR thresholds le ad
to higher EE, as less power is needed for sensing. However,
SeURLLC+ outperforms SeURLLC by using dedicated sensing
symbols which can result in up to around 75% smaller power
consumption due to smaller power demand on communication
symbols to meet sensing criteria.
The impact of the reliability requirement, DEP threshold, o n
the network availability is shown in Fig. 3. We compare the
results with three values of blocklength equal to 140, 160, a nd
180 symbols. The network availability increases as the DEP
threshold grows and it is more sensitive as the blocklength
decreases. Larger blocklength has higher network availabi lity
and is more robust against lower DEP thresholds, as we see
the curves corresponding to the blocklength of 180 symbols
are almost ﬂat.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a power allocation algorithm for
a downlink cell-free massive MIMO system with multi-static
sensing and URLLC users. The algorithm maximizes EE while
meeting the sensing and URLLC requirements. We introduced
a new deﬁnition of network availability, which considers
both ISAC and URLLC requirements and showed that power
allocation algorithms without taking into account sensing re-
quirements could not provide sensing. Moreover, the numeri cal
results validated the proposed power allocation algorithm andshowed that additional sensing symbols are needed to enhanc e
the performance of the network. We observed that higher
blocklength is more robust in terms of the network availabil ity
to satisfy stringent reliability requirements, although i t would
result in a lower energy efﬁciency.
