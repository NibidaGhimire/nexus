Abstract
In this tutorial, we provide a coordinate-free derivation of the system of equa-
tions that govern equilibrium of a thin shell that can undergo shear. This
system involves tensorial fields representing the internal force and couple
per unit length that adjacent parts of the shell exchange at their common
boundary. By an appropriate decomposition of those quantities, we obtain a
representation of the internal power in terms of time derivatives of suitable
strain measures. Subsequently, we propose constitutive equations that em-
ploy these strain measures as independent variables. After specializing the
theory to the case of unshearable shells, we linearize the resulting equations.

1. Introduction
1.1. Aim of this tutorial
Most of the scholarly work dealing with shells makes extensive use of
coordinate systems, and sometimes of concepts from differential geometry,
such as covariant derivatives, Christhoffel symbols, and so on. The same is
true for most textbooks on shell theory (Adriaenssens et al., 2014; Ciarlet,
2021; Mansfield, 1989; Møllmann, 1981). In some cases, the treatment is

Calladine (1983).
While coordinates undeniably serve a crucial role in solving specific prob-
lems, their utilisation may have the unintended consequence of impeding
mechanical insight and obscuring the theory, particularly for those who are
new to the field. By relying on coordinates, focus may be shifted towards
heavyalgebraicmanipulations, divertingattentionfromthefundamentalme-
chanical principles that underlie the theory.
The goal of the present tutorial is to provide a coordinate-free derivation
of the equations that govern the equilibrium of elastic shells using a direct
approach. Wespecificallyfocusonadirector-basedshelltheorycharacterized
by a single director with unit magnitude. Our aim is to demonstrate that
a basic understanding of the theory of thin shells can be achieved without
relying heavily on differential geometry. In fact, the only concepts we shall
need are: a notion of the superficial gradient; a notion of the superficial
divergence and a version of the superficial divergence theorem for tangential
vector fields; the basic result that the superficial gradient of the unit normal
is a symmetric tensor whose range is contained in the tangent space.
In our derivation, we have taken inspiration from Šilhavý (2013). In
particular, we borrow from Šilhavý (2013) the idea of identifying superficial
vectors and tensors with linear mappings having their domain of definition
in the entire space, rather than the tangent space to the surface. This ap-
proach, which can be found in several antecedents, with one of the earliest
being in the work of Gurtin (1995), makes it conceptually easier to compare
vectorsor tensors at two different pointsof the surface. Incontrast to Šilhavý
(2013), however, we consider also shearable shells and, more importantly, our
approach is not variational.
Another coordinate-free treatment of two-dimensional material surfaces
can be found in the work of Gurtin and Ian Murdoch (1975), where bodies
with material boundaries capable of sustaining tension were considered. An
extension of the model to incorporate couple stresses by means of a theory
of grade two has been proposed by Murdoch (1978). A coordinate-free form
of the equilibrium equations, obtained by a deductive approach, are also
offered by Favata and Podio-Guidugli (2012). Equations of equilibrium in
coordinate-freeformhavebeenobtainedbyŠilhavý(2013)asEuler–Lagrange
equations of an energy functional. Within a purely geometrical setting, the
equations of compatibility have been given a coordinate-free formulation by
Seguin and Fried (2022). A coordinate-free version of the Koiter’s model,
2deduced from three-dimensional elasticity through the deductive approach,
has been obtained by Steigmann (2013).
1.2. Deductive and direct approaches
To place our contribution into perspective, a digression concerning the
conventional approaches to deriving theories of thin structures is fitting. The
problem of establishing consistent theories of shells, or other thin structures
such as rods or ribbons, has been addressed through two approaches: the
deductive approach and thedirect approach (Villaggio, 1997).
The deductive approach pursues a theory of thin structures by a process
of “dimension reduction” that has its starting point in a three-dimensional
theory. Typically, this theory is linear or nonlinear elasticity, or a multi-
physics theory having elasticity as its backbone. Nevertheless, there exist
derivations that begin with with the theory of viscous fluids (Ribe, 2002),
and with atomistic models (Azizi et al., 2023; Davini et al., 2017)
The most elementary approaches to dimension reduction hinge on an
Ansatz concerning the particular form of the displacement, strain, or stress.
Such assumptions are often based on intuition or on comparisons with special
cases which admit exact solutions. Although the Ansatz does not satisfy the
three-dimensional equations in all cases, an averaging process is employed
over the thickness of body to provide approximate descriptions of the stress,
strain, and displacement.
Moresystematicandsophisticatedmethodsfordevelopingtheoriesofthin
structures have also been devised: the asymptotic method (Ciarlet et al.,
1996; Ciarlet and Lods, 1996; Steigmann, 2007; Wang et al., 2019), the vari-
ational method (Anzellotti et al., 1994; Freddi et al., 2012; Friesecke et al.,
2002), the constraint and the scaling method (Daví, 1993; Lembo, 1989;
Podio-Guidugli, 1989, 1990), among others. These methods not only offer
more systematic derivations, but also make it possible to derive theories of
non-conventional thin structures such as ribbons (Freddi et al., 2016), or
structures made of nematic elastomers (Agostiniani and DeSimone, 2017;
Davoli et al., 2021), magneto-acive materials Davoli et al. (2021), thermoe-
lastic materials Favata (2016), piezoelectric materials (Nicotra and Podio-
Guidugli, 1998; Vidoli and Batra, 2000), polymer gels (Andrini et al., 2021;
Lucantonio and Nardinocchi, 2012), and general morphing materials (Ar-
gento et al., 2021), for which standard methods fall short due to lack of
intuition and the absence of precedent.

n(y(x)), and the tangent space Ty(x)Saty(x). For an unshearable shell, the director
coincides with the current normal, i.e.,d(x) =n(x).
With the direct approach, a thin structure is instead regarded from the
outset as a lower-dimensional continuous body. To resist bending, this body
must support internal couples, a feature which demands that extra kinemat-
ics comes into play, through the inclusion of a set of directors or the second
gradients of the deformation in the list of state variables. Examples of ap-
plication of the direct approach can be found in the work of Antman (2005),
Naghdi (1973), and Rubin (2000). It is worth noting that, for most director-
based shell theories (Cohen and DeSilva (1966); Hilgers and Pipkin (1992);
Koiter and Simmonds (1973); Sanders (1963)) the set of relevant directors
reduces to the unit normal to the surface; in this case, the strain energy
depends on both the first and second gradients of the deformation.
1.3. Outline
Our presentation is based on the direct approach described above. We
model a shell as a two dimensional continuous body of oriented particles. We
identifythesetofsuchparticleswithasmoothsurface Sinthree-dimensional
Euclideanpointspace E, andwedescribethetypicalconfigurationoftheshell
by assigning to each particle x∈ Sa place y(x)on the deformed surface S,
and an orientation, specified by a unit vector d(x)as illustrated in Fig. 1.3.
4Our first result is a coordinate-free form of the equilibrium equations that
govern the shell:
divS+b=0,
skw 
(divM+c)⊗d+SF⊤+MG⊤
=0.(1)
These equations are obtained through an argument based on the invariance
of the external power expended on an arbitrary subsurface Pof the reference
configuration S.
HereF=∇yandG=∇dare the (superficial) gradients of, respectively,
the placement and the director field. Moreover, SandMare tensor fields on
Swhich convey the densities, per unit referential length , of force and couple
that adjacent body parts exchange across their common boundary in the
deformed configuration . In the theory of shells, the tensors SandMplay
analogous roles to the Piola stress in three-dimensional Cauchy continua.
Likewise, bandcare the surface densities of the body force and the body
couple, possibily including inertia.
The tensor fields S,M,F, and Garesuperficial : they are supposed
to act solely on vectors on TxS, the tangent space at x. For convenience,
however, we extend their domain of definition to TE, the space of all vectors,
by stipulating that Sn=0,Mn =0, and so on. Thus, S,M,F, and G
are linear transformation from TE, the space of translations of Einto itself,
whose null space includes n. This makes it conceptually easier to compare
the values of tensor fields at different point of Swithout introducing the
differential-geometric notion of a connection (Lee, 2003).
In the first of (1), the divergence of the superficial tensor field Sis defined
as follows: first, for va tangential vector field, we set divv= tr∇v=P· ∇v,
where ∇vis the surface gradient of vandP(x) =I−n(x)⊗n(x)is the
projection on the tangent space TxS. Then, divS, is the unique vector field
such that a·divS= div( S⊤a)for every constant vector a(note that S⊤ais
a tangential vector field). The divergence of all other tensor fields is defined
in a similar fashion.
In the second of (1), the symbol ⊗denotes the dyadic product: given
two vectors, say uandv, their dyadic product is the tensor defined by
(u⊗v)w= (v·w)ufor every vector w; moreover, the operator skwapplied
to a tensor gives its skew-symmetric part. Since the dimension of the space
of skew-symmetric tensors is three, the second of (1) is equivalent to three-
5scalar equations; of these equations, the first two can be gathered into
d×(divM+c−l) =0, (2)
where l= (SF⊤−FS⊤)d(note that the projection of (2) along dvanishes
identically). The remaining scalar equation is an algebraic symmetry condi-
tion, whose expression is better rendered by introducing the decompositions:
S=FN+d⊗q,M=FM+d⊗m,G=FG+d⊗g,(3)
where N,M, and Garetangential tensor fields, that is superficial tensor
fields whose range at a given point xisorthogonal to n(x)(the referential
normal), and q,m, and gare tangential vector fields. We refer to Nandq
as, respectively, the membrane-force tensor and theshear-force vector . One
may interpret NandMas the two-dimensional counterparts of the Cosserat
stress (also known as second Piola–Kirchhoff stress). With (3), the scalar
symmetry condition that complements (2) is
skw˜N=0, (4)
where ˜N, defined by
˜N=N−GM⊤, (5)
is theeffective membrane-force tensor .
Our second result, which relies heavily on the decompositions (3) is the
representation
Wint(P)[˙y,˙d] =Z
P
˜N·˙E+M·˙K+˜q·˙s
dS (6)
for the internal power , where ˜q=q−Mgis theeffective shear vector , and
E=1
2(F⊤F−P), K=F⊤G− ∇n, s=F⊤d,(7)
account, respectively, for in plane strain, bending, and shearing. The tensor
fields E,Kand the vector field gvanish when the shell is in the reference
configuration, and are invariant under a change of observer, thus they may be
consideredasappropriatemeasuresofstrain. Weremarkthattheexpressions
(7) are not postulated, but rather follow from the decompositions (3) by
working out the expression of the internal power.
6The expression (6) of the internal power suggests that constitutive pre-
scriptions should be provided for ˜N,M, and ˜q, and that these quantities
should depend on E,K, and s. Evidently, these prescription should be con-
sistent with the symmetry requirement (4). To exploit these constitutive
equations, the equations of equilibrium (1)1and (2) should be rewritten as:
div(FN) + (div q)d+Gq+b=0,
d×(div(FM)−F˜q+c) =0.(8)
The substitution of the expressions of the strain measures (7) into the con-
stitutive equations then leads to a system of governing equations for the
unknowns yandd.
We next turn our attention to unshearable shells, characterized by the
internal constraint:
F⊤d=s≡0. (9)
For unshearable shells, we have m=0andg=0, so that FM=Mand
eq=q. Furthermore, the bending tensor Kcan be written as
K=−n∇F− ∇n, (10)
where n∇Fdenotes the tangential tensor defined such that (n∇F)·A=
∇F·(n⊗A)for every second-order superficial tensor A. Thus, unshearable
shells are in all respects bodies of second-gradient.
For an unshearable shell, the shear vector qis a reactive term that can
be eliminated from the equilibrium equations, leading to the system
PdivN+GF−1(divM+c) +Pb=0,
div(F−1(divM+c))−G·N+n·b= 0,(11)
where P=I−n⊗nis the orthogonal projection on the space perpendicular
ton,
N=FN=PS, (12)
andF−1is the pseudo-inverse of F, that is, given a point xinS,F−1(x)is
the inverse of F(x)when its domain and its codomain are restricted to TxS
andTy(x)S, respectively.
In particular, if the reference configuration coincides with the deformed
configuration (this choice is possible, in principle, even if the deformed con-
figuration is not known), then F=F−1=P(we recall that P=I−n⊗nis
7the orthogonal projector on the tangent space in the reference configuration),
and the above equations reduce to
PdivN+∇n(divM+c) +Pb=0,
div(PdivM+c)− ∇n·N+n·b= 0.(13)
The system (13) can also be obtained by a formal linearization of the equi-
librium equations (11) for small departures from the reference configuration,
granted that the reference configuration is stress-free. For a transversely-
isotropic shell, the linear constitutive equations read:
N=h
2µε+2µλ
2µ+λ(trε)P
+h3
12∇n
2µκ+2µλ
2µ+λ(trκ)P
,
M=h3
12
2µκ+2µλ
2µ+λ(trκ)P
.(14)
Here his the thickness of the shell, µandλare the Lamé moduli of the
material that comprises the shell, and
ε=1
2(P∇v+∇v⊤P) +w∇n,
κ=−P∇∇w+∇n∇v+∇v⊤∇n+w(∇n)2+P v∇∇n,(15)
are the linear strain and bending tensors, with wandv, respectively, the
normal and the tangential component of the displacement. Here, consistent
with the notation introduced in (10), we denote by v∇∇nthe superficial
tensor such that v∇∇n·A=∇∇v·(v⊗A)for every second-order superficial
tensor A. Note that ∇n=∇n⊤and, thus, that (∇n)n=0, whence it
follows that ∇nis a symmetric superficial tensor field. As a consequence, ε
andκare symmetric superficial tensor fields. If the shell is stressed in its
reference configuration, the linearization of the equilibrium equations and of
the constitutive equations gives rise to additional terms, both in the equi-
librium equations (13) and in the constitutive equations (14). The explicit
form of these terms is also determined.
To illustrate the benefits of a coordinate-free approach, we specifically
carry out the linearization of the governing equations for an internally pres-
surized spherical shell. As a result, thanks to the coordinate-free approach,
we obtain the motion equations of the shell in terms of well-recognizable and
familiar differential operators, such as gradient, divergence, and Laplacian,
8applied to the normal and tangential components of the displacement field.
As a further result, we derive the characteristic equations that determine the
natural frequencies and mode shapes. This task is greatly simplified by the
notably simple form that the aforementioned differential operators take when
applied to spherical harmonics.
2. Thin-shells - preliminaries
We use the symbol Eto denote the ambient three-dimensional Euclidean
point space. We denote by TEthe translation space of E. We refer to the
elements of Easpointsand to the elements of TEasvectors. We use the
termsecond-order tensor to refer to a linear transformation from TEtoTE,
and we denote the space of such transformations by Lin(TE, TE). We use
the term third-order tensor any linear transformations that maps vectors into
tensors or tensors into vectors. When a third-order tensor Ais treated as
a linear transformation of vectors into tensors, we represent its action on a
vector abyAa. Conversely, when Ais regarded as a linear transformation
of tensors into vectors, we denote its action on a second-order tensor Aby
AA. We use a dot to denote the standard scalar product between vectors
or second-order tensors. Furthermore, we let aAbe the unique second-order
tensor such that aA·A=A·a⊗A=a·AAfor every second-order tensor
A.
Inwhatfollows, Sisasmoothorientedsurfacewhosepositiveunitnormal
field is denoted by n. Given a point x∈ S,TxSis the linear space of vectors
orthogonal to n(x). We shall make frequent use of the orthogonal projector
onTxS:
P(x) =I−n(x)⊗n(x). (16)
A vector field vsuch that v·n= 0everywhere on Sis calledtangential . A
tensor field AonSissuperficial ifAn=0everywhere on S. A superficial
tensor field Athat satisfies A⊤n=0,i.e., has range perpendicular to n
everywhere on S, is also called tangential. Equivalently, a tangential field
Ais superficial if and only if PA=A. We shall use bold slanted fonts for
tangential tensor fields that are not superficial, and bold sans-serif upright
fonts for superficial tensor fields.
We refer to Appendix A.1 for the definition of differentialoperators acting
on scalar, vector, and tensor fields on S. In particular, for the definition of
the gradient operator ∇and of the allied divergence divoperator, alongside
9with a version of the divergence theorem for tangential vector and tensor
fields on a surface.
The kinematical descriptors of the shell are: a smooth, invertible place-
ment y:S → E, which maps Sinto another smooth surface S; a director
fieldd:S → U, which maps Son the unit sphere U ⊂TE.
We require that ∇y(x)+d(x)⊗n(x)be invertible for all x∈ S. This re-
quirementguaranteesthat ∇y(x)isinvertiblewhenitsdomainandcodomain
are restricted, respectively, to TxSandTx(y)S, and that the director d(x)
does not belong to Ty(x)S, the tangent space of Sat the point y(x). In the
reference configuration the deformation is y(x) =xand the director field is
given by d(x) =n(x)for all x∈ S. Granted the smoothness of y(·), the
surface Sadmits a unit normal everywhere, as given by
n=(∇y)⋆n
|(∇y)⋆n|, (17)
withA⋆, the cofactor of A, being the unique tensor such that Av×Aw=
A⋆(v×w)for all pairs of vectors vandw.
3. Part-wise equilibrium equations.
We assume that there exist two superficial tensor fields SandMsuch
that the external power expended on an open subset Pof the surface Sis
given by
Wext(P)[˙y,˙d] =Z
∂P(SnP·˙y+MnP·˙d) +Z
P(b·˙y+c·˙d),(18)
where nPis the tangential field on ∂Pthat has unit magnitude, is orthogonal
to∂P, and points away from P. The vector fields SnPandMnPare the
line densities of, respectively contact forces andcontact couples acting on P
through ∂P. We refer to bandc, respectively, as the referential densities of
thebody force and thebody couple .
Since dis a unit vector, it is orthogonal to ˙d. Thus the term MnP·˙d
in the expression of the expended power (18) depends only on the projection
ofMnPon the orthogonal complement of d. We therefore assume, without
loss of generality, that the range of Mis orthogonal to d, namely that
M⊤d=0. (19)
10We require that the external power be invariant under the superposition of
a rigid velocity field
˙y7→˙y+v+W(y−o),
˙d7→˙d+Wd,(20)
where vis a constant vector, Wis a constant skew-symmetric tensor, and o
is the point corresponding to some chosen origin; this requirement leads to
the part-wise balance equations
Z
∂PSn+Z
Pb=0,
Z
∂P(Sn∧(y−o) +Mn∧d) +Z
P(b∧(y−o) +c∧d) = 0 ,(21)
where a∧b=a⊗b−b⊗a. As shown in Appendix A.2, the use of the
divergence theorem yields
Z
P(divS+b) =0,
Z
P 
(divM+c)∧d+ (div S+b)∧(y−o) + 2skw( S∇y⊤+M∇d⊤)
=0,
(22)
where, for Aa tensor, skwA=1
2(A−A⊤)is the skew-symmetric part of
the second-ordet tensor A.
4. Point-wise equilibrium equations.
Henceforth we set
F=∇y,G=∇d. (23)
We note that, since d·d= 1,∇d⊤d=0, that is,
G⊤d=0. (24)
Thanks to the arbitrariness of the part Pin (22), a standard localization
argument yields the point-wise equilibrium equations (1), which we repeat
below for the reader’s convenience:
divS+b=0, (25a)
skw 
(divM+c)⊗d+SF⊤+MG⊤
=0. (25b)
11The first of (25) coincides with (4.9) of DiCarlo et al. (2001); the second can
be obtained by combining (5.14) with (4.23b) of DiCarlo et al. (2001).
Equation (25b) is equivalent to two scalar partial-differential equations ,
andone scalar algebraic equation . To verify this assertion, let us consider
any vector field perpendicular to d. With a slight abuse of notation, let us
denote such vector by ˙d(later, we will use the results obtained here with ˙d
being the actual rate of change of d). On taking the scalar product of both
sides of (25b) with 2˙d⊗dwe obtain
˙d·(divM+c) = 2 ˙d·skw(FS⊤+GM⊤)d. (26)
Using (19) and (24), we see that GM⊤d=MG⊤d=0, and hence, on
setting
l= 2skw( FS⊤)d, (27)
we find that (26) can be expressed as
˙d·(divM+c) =˙d·l. (28)
Thus, a first consequence of (25b) is
d×(divM+c−l) =0, (29)
which is equivalent to two scalar partial-differential equations. The other
consequence of (25b) is obtained by pre-multiplying and post-multiplying
(25b) by Pd=I−d⊗d. This yields, in view of (19)–(24),
skw(PdSF⊤Pd+MG⊤) =0. (30)
Byconstruction, theleft-handsideof (30)isaskew-symmetrictensorthat, at
agivenpoint xofS, mapstheorthogonalcomplementof d(x)intoitself, thus
has rank at most one. Therefore, (30) is equivalent to one scalar equation.
We will see shortly that (30) can be cast in a form that looks more
convenient in the light of the constitutive theory that we develop below, the
starting point of which is an expression of the internal power in terms of
appropriate strain tensors. As a preliminary step, we next introduce suitable
decompositions of the tensorial quantities of interest.
125. Decomposition
As a preliminary step, we introduce a particular pseudo-inverse of F.
First, we set
eF=F+d⊗n. (31)
InSection2, weassumedthat eF(x)beaninvertibletensor. Asaconsequence
of that assumption, we can define the inverse F−1ofFby
F−1=PeF−1, (32)
where we recall from (16) that P(x)is the orthogonal projector on TxS, the
tangent space of Satx. We observe that eF−1d=n, so that
F−1d=0. (33)
We also observe that eFis a bijection between the orthogonal complement of
nand the orthogonal complement of n. Thus, for every vector vsuch that
v·n= 0, we have eF−1v·n=0, whence v·eF−⊤n= 0. Thus, eF−⊤nis parallel
tonand therefore we can write eF−⊤n=αnfor some α∈R. Then, by (33),
we have αd·n=d·eF−⊤n=eF−1d·n= 1. Altogether, we have
eF−⊤n= (d·n)−1n. (34)
Using (32)–(33), we compute F−1F=PeF−1F=PeF−1(eF−d⊗n) =
P−PeF−1d⊗n=P−F−1d⊗n=P. Likewise, using (34) we write
FF−1= (eF−d⊗n)(I−n⊗n)eF−1=I−eFn⊗eF−⊤n=I−d⊗(d·n)−1n.
In conclusion, we have established that
F−1F=P, (35a)
FF−1=Pd, (35b)
where
Pd=I−(d·n)−1d⊗n. (36)
We notice that Pdis the identity on the orthogonal complement of n, and
that
Pdd=0. (37)
13Additional discussion concerning F−1is contained in Appendix A.3.
Theintroductionofthepseudo-inverse F−1opensthewaytoaconvenient
decomposition of the tensorial quantities of interest. As to the tensor field S,
wecanwrite S=IS=PdS+(d·n)−1(d⊗n)S=FF−1S+(d·n)−1d⊗S⊤n.
Thus, on setting
N=F−1Sand q= (d·n)−1S⊤n, (38)
we have the decomposition
S=FN+d⊗q. (39)
We note that, since the range of F−1is orthogonal to n, the tensor field Nis
superficial, i.e.,Nmaps tangential tensors into tangential tensors. Likewise,
sinceSis tangential ( i.e.Sn=0), the vector field qis tangential. We
shall refer to Nandq, respectively, as the membrane-force tensor and the
shear-force vector.
The argument leading to (38) can be repeated to obtain the decomposi-
tions
M=FM+d⊗m,G=FG+d⊗g, (40)
where MandGare superficial tensor fields and mandgare tangential
tensor fields. Concerning (40), we observe for later use that, since M⊤and
G⊤annihilate d(recall (19) and (24)), we have
M⊤F⊤d+m=0, G⊤F⊤d+g=0, (41)
Using the decompositions (39), (40), and (51), we can rewrite (25a) and
(25b), respectively as
div(FN) + (div q)d+Gq+b=0, (42)
and
skw((div( FM) +c−F(q−Mg))⊗d+F(N−GM⊤)F⊤) =0.(43)
Now, we pre-multiply and post-multiply both sides of (43) by F−1andF−⊤.
Since F−1d=0, we obtain F−1skw(F(N−GM⊤)F⊤)F−⊤=0, that is,
skw(F−1F(N−GM⊤)F⊤F−⊤) =0. Recalling the first of (35a), and noting
that N,G, and Mare superficial tensor fields, we arrive at the following
symmetry condition:
skw(N−GM⊤) =0. (44)
14Thus,(43)reducesto skw 
(div(FM) +c−F(q−Mg))⊗d
=0,whichcan
be recast as
d×(div(FM) +c−F(q−Mg)) =0. (45)
Equations (44) and (45) are equivalent to, respectively, (30) and (29).
6. Internal power and strain measures
6.1. Internal power
Startingfromthedefinitionofexternalpowerin(19), usingthedivergence
theorem and exploiting the equilibrium equations (25a) and (29), we write
Wext(P)[˙y,˙d] =Z
P
S·˙F+ (div S+b)·˙y+M·˙G+ (div M+c)·˙d
=Z
P
S·˙F+M·˙G+l·˙d
. (46)
Motivated by (46), we define, for every part P, theinternal power expended
on a a pair (˙y,˙d)withd·˙d= 0as

. (47)
The definition (47) applies for any assignment of the tensors field S,M,
and of the vector field l, irrespectively of whether these fields satisfy the
equilibriumequations(25a)and(29). Thecalculationsin(46)show,however,
thatiftheequilibriumequations(25a)and(29)hold, thentheexternalpower
and the internal power coincide:
Wint(P)[˙y,˙d] =Wext(P)[˙y,˙d]. (48)
6.2. Strain measures
We next exploit the decompositions (39) and (40) to obtain an alternative
expression of the internal power in terms of rates of suitable strain descrip-
tors. We begin with the first term under integral sign on the right-hand side
of (47). By (39), we can write
S·˙F=FN·F+d⊗q·˙F=N·F⊤˙F+q·˙F⊤d. (49)
15We next turn our attention to the second term under integral sign in (47).
Using the decompositions (40), we obtain
M·˙G= (FM+d⊗m)·˙G=M·F⊤˙G+˙G⊤d·m
=M·˙F⊤G−M·˙F⊤G+˙G⊤d·m−G⊤˙d·m
=M·˙F⊤G−GM⊤·˙F+˙G⊤d·m−Gm·˙d
=M·˙F⊤G−FGM⊤·˙F−(d⊗g)M⊤·˙F+˙G⊤d·m
−FGm·˙d−(d⊗g)Gm·˙d
=M·˙F⊤G−GM⊤·F⊤˙F−Mg·˙F⊤d
+˙G⊤d·m−Gm·F⊤˙d. (50)
In the last of the above chain of equalities we have used the orthogonality
between ˙danddto eliminate the last term in the fourth line.
We now consider the last term of the integrand in (47). Using (34) and
(36), we write l=Il=Pdl+ (d·n)−1(d⊗n)l=FF−1l+ (d·n)−1(l·n)d.
We then set ℓ=F−1landλ= (d·n)−1l·n, giving
l=Fℓ+λd, (51)
thus, can write
l·˙d=Fℓ·d+λd·˙d=ℓ·F⊤˙d. (52)
Combining (49), (50), and (52), we obtain
Wint(P)[˙y,˙d]
=Z
P
(N−GM⊤)·F⊤˙F+M·˙F⊤G+(q−Mg)·˙F⊤d+(ℓ−Gm)·F⊤˙d
.
(53)
We now return to the definition of lin (27), and we use, in order, the de-
composition (39) of S, the symmetry condition (44), and the relations (41)
to obtain
l=FS⊤d−SF⊤d
=FN⊤F⊤d+Fq−FNF⊤d−(Fq·d)d
=Fq−(Fq·d)d+FGM⊤F⊤d−FGM⊤F⊤d
=Fq−(Fq·d)d+FGm−FMg. (54)
16Since the decomposition (51) is unique, from (54) we deduce that
ℓ=q+Gm−Mg. (55)
Using (55), and bearing in mind that N−GM⊤is symmetric, we obtain,
from (53), the following representation for the internal power:
Wint(P)[˙y,˙d] =Z
P
(N−GM⊤)·1
2˙F⊤F+M·˙F⊤G+(q−Mg)·˙F⊤d
.(56)
The representation (56) of the internal power motivates us to set
˜N=N−GM⊤, ˜q=q−Mg, (57)
and to introduce the strain measures
E=1
2(F⊤F−P),K=F⊤G− ∇n,s=F⊤d, (58)
where we recall that P(x)is the orthogonal projection on TxS. We note on
passing that the strain measures vanish when y(x) =xandd(x) =n(x),
i.e., when the shell is in its reference configuration. By making use of (57)
and (58), we can express (56) as
Wint(P)[˙y,˙d] =Z
P ˜N·˙E+M·˙K+˜q·˙s
. (59)
We call E,K, and s, respectively, the stretching tensor , thebending tensor ,
and theshear vector .
6.3. Dissipation principle
Forψthe free-energy density per unit reference area, the dissipation
principle asserts that
d
dtZ
Pψ≤Wext(P)[˙y,˙d] =Wint(P)[˙y,˙d], (60)
during every admissible process. The arbitrariness of the part Pin (60)
yields, by localization, the point-wise version
˙ψ≤˜N·˙E+M·˙K+˜q·˙s (61)
17of the dissipation principle. Motivated by the form of the right-hand side
of (61), we select as state variables the strain measures E,Kands, and we
assume that the free-energy density ψobeys the constitutive equation:
ψ=ˆψ(E,K,s). (62)
Then, on requiring, in the manner introduced by Coleman and Noll (1963),
that (61) be satisfied for whatever local continuation of any conceivable pro-
cess, we obtain the constitutive equations:
˜N=∂Eˆψ(E,K,s),
M=∂Kˆψ(E,K,s),
˜q=∂sˆψ(E,K,s).(63)
The equilibrium equation (44), namely
skweN=0, (64)
is identically satisfied. The remaining equilibrium equations, namely (42)
and (45), can now be written in terms of eN,Mandeq:
div(F(eN+GM⊤)) + div( eq+Mg)d+G(eq+Mg) +b=0,
d×div(FM+c−Feq) =0;(65)
(65) can be cast into a system of partial differential equations where the
unknown quantities are the deformation yand of the director field d. In
fact, ˜N,M, and sdepend, through the constitutive equations (63), on the
strains E,K, and s, which in turn can be expressed in terms of F=∇y,
G=∇d, andd. Likewise the superficial tensor field Gdefined in the second
equation of (40) can be expressed in terms of EandK:
G=F−1G=F−1F−⊤F⊤G= (F⊤F)−1(K+∇n) = (2 E+P)−1(K+∇n).
(66)
Finally, gis determined by F,G, and dthrough the second of (41). Thus,
using the definitions of the strain measures, (66), and the second of (41),
we can write the system of partial differential equations (65) in terms of the
deformation yand the director field d.
It is worth noting that the tangential vector mappearing in the decom-
position of Min (40) does not appear in the power expenditure or in the
equilibrium equations.
187. Unshearable shells
For an unshearable shell, the shear vector defined in (58) vanishes along
every evolution process:
s=F⊤d=0, (67)
that is, the director dis orthogonal to the range of the deformation gradi-
entF=∇y. At a given point x, there are only two unit vectors with this
property, namely, n(x)and−n(x). Moreover, d(x) =n(x)when the shell
is in its reference configuration. Thus, if we maintain that the current con-
figuration is connected with the reference configuration by a smooth family
of maps satisfying (67), we must have
d=n(F) =F⋆n
|F⋆n|, (68)
a formula which shows that the current configuration of the shell is deter-
mined solely by the deformation y:S →S. As a result, the bending tensor
Kdefined in (58) can be expressed in terms of Fand∇F. Indeed, by taking
the gradient of F⊤n=0, we obtain F⊤∇n+n∇F=0, which implies that
F⊤G=−n(F)∇F, (69)
whence
G=−F−⊤(n(F)∇F). (70)
Note that, by construction, F⊤Gis a superficial tensor field. In addition,
the third-order tensor field ∇F=∇∇y, regarded as a vector-valued bilinear
form, issymmetricontangentialfields(seeŠilhavý(2013)), i.e.,∇F(a⊗b) =
∇F(b⊗a)for every pair aandbof tangential vectors. Accordingly, for any
such pair we have (F⊤G)·(a⊗b) =−(n∇F)·(a⊗b) =n·(∇F(a⊗b)) =
n·(∇F(b⊗a)) = (F⊤G)·(b⊗a). Thus, F⊤Gis symmetric. Likewise, the
bending strain Kintroduced in (58), namely
K=F⊤G− ∇n=−n∇F− ∇n, (71)
is a symmetric tensor field. Observe also that, granted (68), the projection
tensor Pdcoincides with the orthogonal projection
P=I−n⊗n. (72)
19For the vector min the first of (40) we now have, by (19) and by (67),
m= (M⊤−M⊤F⊤)d=M⊤d−M⊤F⊤d=0. Likewise, by (24), (40),
and (41), we have g= (G⊤−G⊤F⊤)d=G⊤d−G⊤F⊤d=0. Moreover,
the scalar λin the decomposition (51) vanishes. Accordingly, (39), (40), and
(51) are now replaced by
S=FN+n⊗q,M=FM,G=FG,l=Fℓ.(73)
Since g=0, the shear-force vector qand the effective shear-force vector ˜q
defined in (57) coincide:
˜q=q. (74)
We find it convenient to introduce the tensor
N=FN. (75)
The equilibrium equation (42) can then be written as:
divN+ (div q)n+Gq+b=0. (76)
On projecting (76) on the tangent plane Ty(x)S′and along n, and on observ-
ing that, since N⊤n=0,n·divN= div( N⊤n)− ∇n·N=−∇n·N=
−G·N, we obtain
PdivN+Gq+Pb= 0,
divq−G·N+n·b= 0.(77)
Next, we write the equilibrium equation (29) as
PdivM+c−Fq=0. (78)
We multiply both sides of (78) by the pseudoinverse F−1ofF; on recall-
ing that F−1F=P, that FF−1=P, and on observing that F−1P=
F−1(FF−1) =F−1, we get
q=F−1(divM+c). (79)
Using (79), the reactive shear force qappearing in (77) can be eliminated,
so that the following system is arrived at:
PdivN+GF−1(divM+c) +Pb=0,
div(F−1(divM+c))−G·N+n·b= 0.(80)
20The above system is supplemented by constitutive equations for NandM.
Bacause of the internal constraint (67), the shear vector does not enter the
free energy density, and the constitutive equations (63) are replaced by
˜N=∂E˜ψ(E,K), M=∂K˜ψ(E,K). (81)
On recalling that N=˜N+GM⊤, we can write N=FN=F(∂E(˜ψ(E,K) +
G(∂K˜ψ)⊤(E,K)) =F∂E˜ψ(E,K) +G(∂K˜ψ)⊤(E,K). Thus, we obtain the con-
stitutive equations
N=F∂E˜ψ(E,K) +G(∂K˜ψ)⊤(E,K),
M=F∂K˜ψ(E,K).(82)
For a transversely-isotropic shell, a standard choice for the free energy is
˜ψ(E,K) =1
2hC(E−E0)·(E−E0) +1
2h3
12C(K−K0)·(K−K0),(83)
where E0andK0are given pre-strains, and where the fourth-order tensor
Cmaps superficial tensors into superficial tensors according to the following
rule:
CA= 2µA+2µλ
2µ+λ(trA)P, (84)
where µandλare the Lamé moduli, related to the Young’s modulus and
Poisson coefficient by the relations
µ=E
2(1 + ν), λ =νE
(1 +ν)(1−2ν). (85)
Then, the constitutive equations (82) take the form
N=F˚N+G˚M+hFCE+h3
12GCK,
M=F˚M+h3
12FCK,(86)
with

218. Linearization
8.1. Setup
We consider an ε-parametrized family of deformations
y(x) =x+ε1u(x), (88)
and for convenience we introduce a splitting
ε1u=u=wn+v, v·n= 0. (89)
of the displacement u=ε1uinto its normal component wand tangential
component v. Next, we assume that
sup
x∈S|u(x)|
diam(S)+|∇u(x)|
≪1, (90)
that is, the displacement |u|is small compared to the characteristic length of
the reference domain Sand|∇u|is small as well. We assume that the body
couple vanishes and that the body force admits the following expansion:
b=˚b+ε1
b+o(ε). (91)
Likewise, we assume that the tensors NandMadmit the following expan-
sions:
N=˚N+ε1
N+o(ε),M=ε1
M+o(ε), (92)
with ˚Nand˚bsatisfying the system
P(div˚N+˚b) =0,
−∇n·˚N+n·˚b= 0,(93)
which follows by enforcing the equilibrium equations (80) for ε= 0.

tions (86), we aim to show that the quantities

2(P∇v+∇v⊤P) +w∇n,
κ=−P∇∇w+∇n∇v+∇v⊤∇n+w(∇n)2+P(v∇∇n),(97)
are the linear strains.
In the special case when ˚N=0, the equilibrium equations (95) take the
form:
PdivN+∇n(divM) +Pb=0,
div(PdivM)− ∇n·N+n·b= 0.(98)
8.3. Derivation of (95)–(97)
Observing that ∇x=P, from (88) we obtain
F=P+∇u=P+ε∇1u. (99)
For the normal vector nwe assume the expansion
n(ε) =n+εϕ+o(ε). (100)
Since|n|= 1, the vector ϕmust be perpendicular to n:
ϕ·n= 0. (101)
Thus, Pϕ=ϕand hence the requirement F⊤n=0yields
ϕ=−∇1u⊤n. (102)
23It then follows that the projection P=I−n⊗nadmits the expansion
P(ε) =P−ε(ϕ⊗n+n⊗ϕ) +o(ε), which, in view of (102), yields
P(ε).=P+ε(∇1u⊤
n⊗n+n⊗n∇1u), (103)
where the symbol.=denotes equality up to the order ε. Furthermore, for
the tensor G=∇nwe have the expansion G.=∇n+ε∇ϕ, which entails,
because of (102),
G.=∇n−ε∇(∇1u⊤n). (104)
Using (99) and (104), and noting that P∇n=∇n, we obtain the expansions
E=1
2(F⊤F−P) =1
2((P+ε∇1u⊤)(P+ε∇1u)−P).=ε1
E,
K=F⊤G− ∇n.= (P+ε∇1u)⊤(∇n−ε∇(∇1u⊤n))− ∇n.=ε1

E=1
2(P∇1u+∇1u⊤P)and1
K=−P∇(∇1u⊤n) +∇1u⊤∇n.(106)
We observe that both1

W⊤∇n=0, as claimed.
On using the decomposition (89), we can write

E=1
2(P∇v+∇v⊤P) +w∇n=:ε. (109)
Moreover, noting that ε∇1u⊤n=ε∇(1u·n)−ε∇n1u=ε∇(1u·n)−ε∇nP1u=
∇w− ∇nv, so that −εP∇(∇1u⊤n) =−P∇∇w+∇n∇v+P(v∇∇n), and
24noting also that ε∇1u⊤∇n=w(∇n)2+ (∇w⊗n)∇n+∇v⊤∇n=w∇n2+
∇v⊤∇n, we obtain
ε1
K=−P∇∇w+∇n∇v+∇n∇v+w∇n2+P(v∇∇n) =:κ.(110)
On recalling (92), the linearization of the constitutive equations (86) yields

N=∇1u˚N+hC1

We can now substitute the above expansions into the equilibrium equations
(80). At order zero we obtain (93). Taking into account the equilibrium
equations at order zero, we obtain, at first order:
Pdiv1
N+∇ndiv1
M+P1
b=0,
Pdivdiv1
M− ∇n·1
N+n·1
b+˚N· ∇(∇1u⊤n)− ∇1u⊤n·˚b=0.(113)
Multiplying the first of (113) by εand using (94) we obtain the first of
(95). Multiplying the second of (113) by εand observing that ∇1u⊤n=
∇w− ∇n⊤1u=∇w− ∇n1u=∇w− ∇nvwe obtain the second of (95).
8.4. A more general case
It is also possible to derive linearized equations with a non-vanishing
initial bending moment and body couple. First, the linearization of the
constitutive equations (86) yields
N.=˚N+ε1
N,M.=˚M+ε1
M, (114)
where
1
N=∇1u˚N−(∇(∇1u⊤n) +∇1u∇n)˚M+hC1

12∇nC1
K,

M=∇1u˚M+h3

K.(115)
25The equilibrium equations at zeroth order are
Pdiv˚N+∇n(div˚M+˚c) +P˚b=0,
div(Pdiv˚M+˚c))− ∇n·˚N+n·˚b= 0.(116)
Next, we need to compute the linearization of the pseudo-inverse. At first
order, we have the expansion
F−1(ε) =P+εL+o(ε), (117)
for some tensor L. To identify L, we recall that F−1F=P. Then, on
combining (99) and (117) we obtain F−1(ε)F(ε) =P+ε(LP+P∇1u)+o(ε).
Thus,
LP=−P∇1u. (118)
Moreover, recalling that the pseudo-inverse F−1annihilates d=n, we write
0=F−1(ε)n(ε) = (P+εL+o(ε))(n+εϕ+o(ε)) =ε(Ln− ∇1u⊤n) +o(ε),
to obtain
Ln=∇1u⊤n. (119)
Since L=L(P+n⊗n) =L+ (Ln)⊗n, on combining (118) and (119)
we obtain the following expression for the first-order term in the expansion
ofF−1(ε):
L=−P∇1u+∇1u⊤n⊗n. (120)
Substituting in to the equilibrium equations we obtain, at first order,
Pdiv1
N+∇n(div1

+˚N· ∇(∇1u⊤n)−(n⊗˚b)· ∇1u=0. (121)
9. Application: free vibrations of a pressurized spherical shell
As an application of the theory, we deduce and solve the equations that
govern the free vibrations of a pressurized spherical shell. For a generic
geometry, incremental equations governing equilibrium for small departures
from a pre-stressed reference configuration may be found in (Timoshenko
26and Gere, 1961, p. 452) and in Zubov (1976, 1985). A set of equations
obtained by a systematic linearization of non-linear theory has been carried
out more recently in Altenbach and Eremeyev (2014). For a spherical shell,
incremental equilibrium equations can also be found in (Flügge, 1962, p.
262). More recently, the equations that govern axisymmetric oscillations of
pressurizedsphericalshellhavebeenderivedandstudiedbyKuoetal.(2015),
where the contribution of the pre-stress induced by the internal pressure is
accounted for by an ad hocargument.
To maintain a manageable complexity in the equations, coordinate-based
treatmentsareusuallyrestrictedtoaxisymmetricsolutions, andoftenneglect
bending contributions (see for instance Baker (1961); Flügge (1962); Rand
and DiMaggio (1967)). On the contrary, our concise notation alleviates the
need for such assumptions. Still, to underscore the key aspects of the lin-
earization process, we will initially set aside bending moments, introducing
them subsequently.
9.1. The reference state
We suppose that the body admits an equilibrium state, which we refer to
as thereference state , where its material elements occupy a spherical surface
of radius R, under the action of the body-force field
˚b=pn, (122)
and a null body-couple field. We assume that in the reference state
˚N=pR
2P, ˚M=0. (123)
To verify that the body-force field (122) equilibrates the stress fields (123)
we observe that, since, for a sphere of radius R,
∇n=1
RP, (124)
we have divP= div( I−n⊗n) =−(∇n)n]−(P· ∇n)n=−(2/R)n, and,
hence,
div˚N=pR
2divP=−pn=−˚b, (125)
and
˚N·P=p. (126)
Thus the equilibrium equations (93) are satisfied.
279.2. Perturbed states
We suppose that the body force and body couple in a generic state are
given by:
b=pF⋆n−hρu′′,c=0. (127)
We recall that F⋆is the cofactor of F, and that F⋆(x)n(x)is the vector
pointing in the direction of n(x), with intensity being the ratio between an
infinitesimal surface element placed at xin the reference configuration and
the area of its image under the deformation y.
We next evaluate (127) for small departures from the reference state. To
begin with, we observe that
F⋆n= det( F+n⊗n)n. (128)
One way to verify (128) is as follows. Let aandbtwo tangent vectors
in the reference configuration such that n=a×b. Then, FaandFb
are tangent to Sand are linearly independent, since Fis injective. Thus,
F⋆n=F⋆(a×b) =Fa×Fbis parallel to n. Also, for eF=F+n⊗n, we
haveeFn=n,eFa=Fa, andeFb=Fb. Since F⋆nis parallel to n, we have
F⋆n= (n·F⋆n)n. Moreover, n·F⋆n=n·Fa×Fb=eFn·eFa×eFb=
det(eF)(n·a×b) = det( F+n⊗n), whence (128).
Now, we can use (99) and (100) to write det(F+n⊗n) = det( P+n⊗
n+ε∇1u+ (n−n)⊗n) = det( I+ε∇1u+ (n−n)⊗n) = det( I+ε(∇1u+
ϕ⊗n)+o(ε)).= 1+ εtr(∇1u) = 1+ εP·∇1u= 1+ εP·(∇1v+1w∇n+n⊗∇1w)
= 1 + ε(div1v+ 21w/R); thus,
det(F+n⊗n).= 1 + ε
div1v+ 21w

. (129)
Moreover, recalling again (100)–(102) and using (124), we find that n.=
n+ε(−∇1u⊤n) =n+ε(−∇1w+∇n1v), whence
n.=n+ε

289.3. Incremental equilibrium equations: the case of null bending moment
We now write the incremental equilibrium equations (95) specialized to
the case when the shell does not resist bending. We have from (131) that
the tangential component of the force increment bis
Pb=−ϱhv′′−p∇w+p
Rv. (132)
Furthermore, recalling that ˚bis parallel to n, and observing that both ∇nv
and∇ware orthogonal to n, we have from (131),
n·b+˚b·(∇nv− ∇w) =pdivv+ 2pw
R−hϱv′′. (133)

a, we have (v∇P)a=−(v· ∇na)n= (n⊗ ∇nv)a. Thus, v∇P=n⊗ ∇nv.
Therefore, P·(v∇P) =P·n⊗∇nv=Pn·∇n⊤v= 0. By (132), (133), and
(134), the equilibrium equations (95) with M=0take the form:

The structure of (142) is straightforward. The left-hand side of each equation
comprisestwoterms, eachonebeingtheproductofacoefficient—dependent
on both the properties of the shell and the pressure — and a term which
consists in the action of differential operators on the normal and tangential
components of the displacement field, and which vanishes for infinitesimal
rigid displacements.
309.4. Coordinate expression for axisimmetric motions.
Using a system of spherical coordinates (θ, ϕ)described in Appendix A.5,
we represent a time-dependent axisymmetric displacement field u(θ, ϕ, t )as
the sum
u(θ, ϕ, t ) =v(θ, ϕ, t ) +w(θ, t)n(θ) (143)
of a normal component w(θ, t)n(θ)and a tangential component
v(θ, ϕ, t ) =v⟨θ⟩(θ, t)a⟨θ⟩(θ), (144)
where a⟨θ⟩(θ)is the first element of the physical basis.
Using the results from Appendix A.5 concerning the coordinate represen-
tation of the differential operators ∆,∇div,div, and∇, and recalling also
(85), we find that the first of the equations of motion (142) has only one
nontrivial component, namely, that in the direction of a⟨θ⟩:
Eh

(146)
Forp= 0, (145) and (146) coincide, respectively, with (1) and (2) of Kuo
et al. (2015). However, the extra terms arising from pare different from those
obtained by Kuo et al. (2015). In particular, in our formulation the initial
pre-stress also affects the tangential motion of the shell. However, the extra
contribution of the normal component of the displacement that appears in
our equations of motion coincides with that in the corresponding equations
of Kuo et al. (2015).
9.5. Solutions using vector spherical harmonics
We divide both sides of (142) by µand we introduce the dimensionless
parameters H=h/R,P=p/µ,Λ = ˜λ/µ= 2λ/(2µ+λ) = 2 ν/(1−ν)∈
[−1,2]. Here ν∈[−1,1/2]is the Poisson ratio. We also introduce the
rescaleddisplacements w=w/R,v=v/R,aswellastherescaledcoordinates
31x=x/Rand the rescaled time t=tp
ρhR/µ. Dropping overbars, and
dividing both sides by Hwe arrive at the following system:

where Ynm(x)are the complex spherical harmonics and bnm(x)andcnm(x)
are the complex vector spherical harmonics vector spherical harmonics on
the unit sphere. The symbol c.c. stands for complex conjugate.
Spherical harmonics are a classical tool of mathematical physics. Their
definition may be found, for example, in Morse and Feshbach (1999). For
the purposes of the present paper, it suffices to recall that the set {Ynm, n≥
0,−n≤m≤m}is an orthonormal (with respect to the L2scalar product),
complete system on the unit sphere, and its elements are eigenfunctions of
the Laplace operator:
−∆Ynm=s2
nYnm, s n=p
n(n+ 1). (149)
Forn≥1and−n≤m≤n, the vector spherical harmonics bnm, and cnm
can be defined on the unit sphere by:
bnm=1
sn∇Ynm, cnm=n×bnm. (150)
Both bnmandcnmare tangential vector fields. These fields satisfy:
divbnm=−snmYnm, divcnm= 0, (151)
along with
−P∆bnm=s2
nbnm,−P∆cnm=s2
ncnm, (152)
Comprehensive discussions of vector spherical harmonics and their applica-
tions may be found in Barrera et al. (1985), Morse and Feshbach (1999),
32and Quartapelle and Verri (1995). Our notation follows more closely Quar-
tapelle and Verri (1995). We advise the reader that Quartapelle and Verri
(1995) define spherical harmonics and vector spherical harmonics over the
entirety of Euclidean point space E. We also remark that our definition of
cnm, although equivalent when the domain of definition is the unit sphere, is
different from that given in Quartapelle and Verri (1995).
Substituting (148) into (147), invoking (150)–(152) and using the orthog-
onality of spherical harmonics and vector spherical harmonics, we find that

ForP/H < 4(1+Λ), the solutions of (153) are oscillatory motions describing
isotropic expansion and contraction. For P/H > 4(1 + Λ) solutions increase
exponentially in time, a behaviour that is the hallmark of the instability of
the reference state. This indicates that internal pressure can indeed foster
instability. Indeed, as the shell expands, the pressure per unit reference area
increases, which in turn pushes the shell further outwards.

33Forn= 1and−1≤m≤1, the vector spherical harmonics cnmare infinites-
imal rotations about an axis going through the origin, and (155) reduces to

nm(t)/dt2= 0. Likewise, for n= 1, (157) reduces to

, (158)
which is singular matrix, with eigenvalues and −6(1 + Λ) ,0. A pair of
corresponding eigenvectors is, in the same order, (1,−√
2)⊤and(1,1/√
2)⊤.
The eigenvector corresponding to the null eigenvalue describes a translation
with constant velocity. In particular, the null eigenvector corresponds to
solutions of the form
v(x, t) = (a0+b0t)b1m(x), w (x, t) =1√
2(a0+b0t)Y1m(x)n(159)
with m=−1,0,1. In particular, m= 0corresponds to translations parallel
to the polar axis, whereas linear combinations of solutions with m=−1, and
m= 1generate translations in the equatorial direction. We next compute:
tr(An) =−(4 +n(n+ 1))Λ −2n(n+ 1)−2 + (2 −n(n+ 1)) P,
det(An) =1

n2+n−2

Note that Λ = 2 ν/(1−ν)is an increasing function of ν, ranging from −1
(forν=−1) to2(forν= 0.5). For these extreme values, and for P≥0, the
trace of Anis negative, while the determinant of Anis positive. Since both
the trace and the determinant of Anare linear functions of Λ, we conclude
that when Pis positive the eigenvalues of Anare negative for n≥2.
9.6. Case of non-vanishing bending moment

For a spherical shell to be considered “thin”, the thickness hshould be at least
one order of magnitude smaller than the radius R, which means that the cor-
rection associated to bending terms is two orders of magnitude smaller than
that from the membrane terms. This is in agreement with Kuo et al. (2015),
where it has been observed that the contribution from bending moments is
negigible.

41Appendix
A.1 Toolbox
Given a smooth tensor field vonS, we define the gradient of vas the
unique superficial tensor field ∇vsuch that, for every x∈ S,
∇v(x)γ′(0) =d
ds
s=0v(γ(s)) (168)
for every smooth curve γ:R→ Ssuch that γ(0) = x. Notice that, in
particular
∇x=P, (169)
where P(x) =I−n(x)⊗n(x)is the orthogonal projection on the tangent
space TxS.
Ifvis a tangential vector field, we define the divergence of vas
divv=P· ∇v. (170)
Given a smooth part PofS, letnPbe the tangent unit vector on ∂Pthat
points away from the interior of P. For va smooth tangential vector field,

we shall make use of the following identity:
Z
∂Pv·nP=Z
Pdivv. (171)
42To define the divergence of a tangential tensor field we first consider a
tensorfieldoftheform a⊗vwhere aisaconstantvectorand visatangential
vector field, and we define:
div(a⊗v) = (div v)a (172)
For any such field, we have
Z
∂P(a⊗v)nP=Z
∂Pv·nP
a=Z
Pdivv
a=Z
P(divv)a=Z
Pdiv(a⊗v).
(173)
Theaboveidentitycarriesovertoarbitrarytangentialtensorfields, sinceeach
such field can be decomposed into a linear combination of dyadic products
between constant vectors and tangential tensor fields. One way to obtain
such decomposition is to fix an orthonormal basis ei,i= 1,2,3forTE.
Then I=P3
i=1ei⊗eiand hence T=P3
i=1ei⊗T⊤ei=P
iei⊗v(i)with
v(i)=T⊤ei. Then, by linearity, we obtain
Z
∂PTnP=Z
PdivT. (174)
We observe from (172) that div(a⊗v) = (∇v·P)a=∇(a⊗v)P(here the
third-ordertensor ∇(a⊗v)isregardedasalinearmappingfromsecond-order
tensors into vectors). Again, by linearity, we have
divT=∇T:P, (175)
and, or every constant vector field a,
a·divT= div( T⊤a). (176)
In particular, if σis a scalar field, then a·div(σT) = div( σT⊤a) =∇σ·
(T⊤a) +σdiv(T⊤a) =a·(T∇σ+σdivT). Hence,
div(σT) =T∇σ+σdivT. (177)
Ifvis a vector field, then div(T⊤v) =∇(T⊤v) :P=∇T: (v⊗P) +
(T⊤∇v) :P, whence
div(T⊤v) = div T·v+T:∇v. (178)
43Given two second-order tensor fields AandB, and a constant vector a, we
havea·div(AB) = div( B⊤A⊤a) =B:∇(A⊤a) +A⊤a·divB=∇A:
(a⊗B) +a·(AdivB) =a·(∇A:B+AdivB), whence
div(AB) =∇A:B+AdivB. (179)
The previous definitions and the identities can easily be generalized to tensor
fields of arbitrary order. In particular, if Tis a third-order tensor field, then,
regarding Tateachpointasalinearmapofvectorsintosecond-ordertensors,
we define the divergence of Tby requiring that, for every constant second-
order tensor A,
A: divT= div( A:T), (180)
where A:Tis the unique vector field vsuch that (A:T)·a=A·(Ta)for
every constant vector a. Consider in particular the third-order tensor field
T=v⊗Twhere vis a vector field and Tis a tangential tensor field. Then
div(v⊗T) =∇v T⊤+v⊗divT. (181)
A.2 Proof of the part-wise equilibrium equations (22)
Starting from (21), we have
Z
∂PSnP∧(y−o) =−2skwZ
∂P((y−o)⊗S)nP=−2skwZ
Pdiv((y−o).⊗S)
(182)
Using the identity (181), we obtain
div((y−o)⊗S) =∇yS⊤+ (y−o)⊗divS. (183)
Thus,

44A.3 Cordinate systems
To compare our results with the literature based on coordinates, we pro-
vide in this subsection some tools for the conversion of our coordinate-free
notation into the coordinate-based notation.
We assume that the surface Scan be parametrized through a smooth
mapbx: Σ→ S, where Σis a domain of R2. Thus, the typical point xonS
can be written as
x=bx(ζ1, ζ2). (186)
We require the function bxto be invertible, and we denote by
x7→(eζ1(x),eζ2(x)) (187)
its inverse. Every field wdefined on Scan be regarded both as a function of
xand of the coordinates (ζ1, ζ2): we use a superposed hat in the former case,
and a superposed tilde in the latter. Thus, we write w=ew(x) =bw(ζ1, ζ2).
To simplify the notation, we will omit hats and tildes in formulas where the
context allows for clear interpretation.
We introduce the covariant basis
aα=∂x
∂ζα=x,α, α = 1,2, (188)
andthephysicalbasis a⟨α⟩=aα/|aα|. Ifthecoordinates ζαaredimensionless,
then
[aα] = Length , [a⟨α⟩] = 1, (189)
i.e., the vectors of the covariant basis have dimension of length, whereas
the vectors of the physical basis are dimensionless. We observe that since
aα,β=x,αβ=x,βαwe have
aα,β=aβ,α. (190)
The unit normal nis given by
n=a−1a1×a2, a =|a1×a2|. (191)
We define the contravariant basis by
aα=∇ζα, α = 1,2. (192)
The contravariant basis is related to the covariant basis by the relation
a1=−n×a2
n·a1×a2, a2=n×a1
n·a1×a2, (193)
45and has the property that
aα·aβ=δβ
α. (194)
Again, if the coordinates are dimensionless, then the elements of the con-
travariant basis have dimensions of reciprocal of a length:
[aα] = Length−1. (195)
Bytakingthesurfacegradientofbothsidesoftheequation x=bx(˜ζ1(x),˜ζ2(x))
and by noting that ∇x=P, we obtain, by the chain rule,
P=aα⊗aα. (196)
Here and in what follows we use the Einstein convention for repeated indices,
with Greek letters ranging from 1 to 2. In particular, it follows from (196)
that if vis a tangential field, then the components of vin the covariant basis
can be obtained by scalar multiplication with the elements of the covariant
basis, viz.
v=Pv= (v·aα)aα=vαaα, vα=v·aα. (197)
The quantities vαare called contravariant components of v, and should not
confused with the physical components v⟨α⟩, which appear in the representa-
tion:
v=v⟨α⟩a⟨α⟩. (198)
A further application of the chain rule yields
∇w=X
α=1,2∂w
∂ζα∇ζα=w,αaα. (199)
Likewise, for va vector field,
∇v=v,α⊗aα. (200)
Thus, if vis a tangential vector field, then by (170) we have divv=P·(v,α⊗
aα) =Pv,α·aα=v,α·Paα, since P=P⊤, and hence
divv=v,α·aα. (201)
Furthermore, introducing the Christoffel symbols
Γβ
αγ=aα,γ·aβ, (202)
46we can write
v,α= (vβaβ),α= (vβ
,α+vγΓβ
αγ)aβ. (203)
Therefore, on setting
vβ|α= Γβ
αγvγ, (204)
we obtain the following expression for the surface divergence:
divv=vα|α. (205)
An alternative expression is
divv=1√a(√avα),α, (206)
where ahas been defined in (191). To verify (206), we recall that aα,β=
x,αβ=aα,β, and we use (193), we obtain
1
a(avα),α=1√a(a1,α×a2·n)vα+1√a(a1×a2,α·nvα) +vα

,β= (vαaα),β·aβ
=v,β·aβ, (207)
as required.
One can also check that if Tis a tensor field of any order, then
divT=T,αaα. (208)
In particular, we can easily recover (181) by computing
div(v⊗T) = (v⊗T),α⊗aα=v,α⊗Taα+v⊗divT.(209)
and by observing that v,α⊗Taα= (v,α⊗aα)T⊤=∇vT⊤.
47A.3 More on the pseudo-inverse F−1.
We begin by proving that the requirements F−⊤n= 0,FF−1=P
andF−1F=Pdetermine a unique pseudo-inverse F−1. Suppose indeed
that there exists two tensors, say F−1and ˜F−1which satisfy the above
requirements. Let D=F−1−˜F−1. Then D−⊤n=0,DF =0and
FD =0. From the equation DF =0we deduce that the null-space of
D(x)is the range of F(x), i.e., the space Ty(x)S; this fact implies that
D=a⊗nfor some vector a. From the equation FD =0we deduce that
abelongs to the null space of F, and hence is parallel to the normal vector
n. Accordingly, we have D=αn⊗nfor some scalar α. However, since
D⊤n=0, the scalar αmust necessarily vanish. Thus, we conclude that
D=0, and hence F−1is unique.
We next construct the pseudo-inverse at a given point xunder the as-
sumption that d(x)does not belong to the tanget space Ty(x)S. To this
effect, we select two linearly-independent vectors a1anda2in the tangent
space at xand we let aα=Faα. We also define a3=nanda3=d. Next
we let (a1,a2,a3), and (a1,a2,a3)be the reciprocal bases of, respectively,
(a1,a2,a3)and(a1,a2,a3). We recall that the reciprocal bases are defined by
the requirement that ai·aj=ai·aj=δj
i, and can be constructed with the
formulas ai= (aj×ak)/(ai·(aj×ak))fori̸=j̸=k. It is easy to check that
a3=n, and that a3= (d·n)−1n. With these definitions, the deformation
gradient can be written as F=aα⊗aα. Moverover, the projectors Pand
Pare given, respectively, by
P=aα⊗aαand P=aα⊗aα. (210)
We conclude by checking that
F−1=aα⊗aα(211)
is the required pseudo-inverse. Indeed, we have F−⊤n= (aα⊗aα)n= (aα⊗
aα)a3=0. Moreover, FF−1= (aα⊗aα)(aβ⊗aβ) = (aα·aβ)(aα⊗aβ) =
δα
β(aα⊗aβ) =aα⊗aα=P. A similar calculation can be used to check that
F−1F=P.
A.4 Proof of the divergence identity (171).
The following proof of the divergence identity is adapted from Fried
(2021). Let tP=n×nP. Then
Z
∂Pv·nP=Z
∂Pn×v·tP. (212)
48Granted that Sis smooth, there exists a neighborhood of Sin which vand
nadmit normally constant extensions, which we still denote by vandn,
respectively. By Stokes’ Theorem,
Z
∂Pn×v·tP=Z
Pcurl(n×v)·n. (213)
We now recall that
curl(n×v)·n=∇(n×v)·(n×), (214)
where (n×)is the unique skew-symmetric tensor such that n×a= (n×)a
for every vector a. Note that, since both vandnare constant along the
normal direction, on Sthe gradient operator in (214) can be taken to be the
surface gradient. Next, we write
∇(n×v)·(n×) = (n×)∇v·(n×)−(v×)∇n·(n×).(215)
As to the first term on the right-hand side of (215), we observe that (n×)2=
−P, and we write
(n×)∇v·(n×) =∇v·(n×)⊤(n×) =−∇v·(n×)2=P· ∇v= div v.(216)
We now claim that the second term on the right-hand side of (215) vanishes.
Indeed, since ∇nis symmetric, and n×is skew-symmetric,
(v×)∇n·(n×) = (v×)·(n×)∇n=1
2(v×)· 
(n×)∇n− ∇n(n×)
.(217)
Since (n×)∇n−∇n(n×)isskew-symmetric,itisequalto a×forsomevector
a. On the other hand, ((n×)∇n− ∇n(n×)
n= 0, which implies that a
is parallel to n. Thus, we conclude that (v×)∇n·(n×) =1
2(v×)·(a×) =
v·a= 0, as desired.
A.5 Spherical coordinates
To compare (142) with existing results, we introduce a coordinate system
on a sphere of radius Rthrough the parametrization
bx(θ, ϕ) =o+Rsinθ(cosϕe1+ sin ϕe2) +Rcosθe3,(218)
where ei,i= 1, . . . , 3is an orthonormal basis, as shown in Fig. 3. Since

a and since ∇x=P(cf.(169)), we have
∇n=1
RP, (220)
and hence
divn=2
R. (221)
The covariant basis is
aθ=x,θ=Rcosθ(cosϕe1+ sin ϕe2) +Rsinθe3,
aϕ=x,ϕ=Rsinθ(−sinθe1+ cos θe2).(222)
The normal vector is
n=aθ×aϕ
|aθ×aϕ|=x−o
R= sin θ(cosθe1+ sin θe2) + cos θe3.(223)
According to (193) and (222), the contravariant basis is
aθ=aθ
|aθ|2=aθ
R, aϕ=aϕ
|aϕ|2=aϕ
R2sin2θ. (224)
509.7. Formulas in the covariant basis.
Consider scalar field w. On applying (199), we write
∇w=w,θaθ+w,ϕaϕ. (225)
When applying differential operators, the resulting computations necessitate
taking the derivatives of the covariant basis vectors. For ease and clarity,
it’s advantageous to represent these derivatives as linear combinations of
the covariant basis and n. An important aspect to remember during these
calculations is that aα, being the partial derivative of xwith respect to α,
obeys the symmetry condition aα,β=aβ,α. This leads to
aθ,θ·aθ= 0, aθ,θ·aϕ= 0,
aθ,ϕ·aθ=aϕ,θ·aθ= 0, aθ,ϕ·aϕ=aϕ,θ·aϕ= cot( θ),
aϕ,ϕ·aθ=−cos(θ) sin(θ),aϕ,ϕ·aϕ= 0,(226)
and
aθ,θ·n=−R,
aθ,ϕ·n=aϕ,θ·n= 0,
aϕ,ϕ·n=−Rsin2(θ).(227)
Thus, we can write
aθ,θ=−Rn, aθ,ϕ=aϕ,θ= cot( θ)aϕ, (228)
and
aϕ,ϕ=−cos(θ) sin(θ)aθ−Rsin2(θ)n. (229)
As a consequence, we have
P∇aα=aα,β⊗aβ= (aα,β·aγ)aγ⊗aβ,
divaα=aα,β·aβ.(230)
In particular
P∇aθ= cot( θ)aϕ⊗aϕ, divaθ= cot( θ),
P∇aϕ= cot( θ)aϕ⊗aθ−cos(θ) sin(θ)aϕ⊗aϕ,divaϕ=−cos(θ) sin(θ),
(231)
Consider now a tangential vector field
v=vαaα. (232)
51Using (200) we find
P∇v= (vαaα),β⊗aβ=vα
,βaα⊗aβ+vαaα,β⊗aβ
=vα
,βaα⊗aβ+vαaα,β⊗aβ
=vα
,βaα⊗aβ+vγ(aγ,β·aα)aα⊗aβ. (233)
This, in turn, yields that the covariant derivative of vis

Thus, the divergence of vis

In particular, taking v=∇wwe find
∆w=1
R2(w,θθ+ cot( θ)w,θ+ csc2(θ)w,ϕϕ). (236)
By taking the divergence of (233) we find

9.8. Formulas in terms of physical components.
While the covariant and contravariant bases are especially useful for com-
putationalpurposes, it’simportanttonotethatthecomponentsofavectorial
or tensorial quantity in these bases do not possess the same dimensions as the
quantity in question. Consequently, it is sometimes advantageous to employ
the physical basis, which is defined as follows:
a⟨θ⟩=aθ
|aθ|=aθ
R, , a⟨ϕ⟩=aϕ
|aϕ|=aϕ
Rsinθ. (239)
52The physical basis is related to the contravariant basis by
aθ=a⟨θ⟩
R, aϕ=a⟨ϕ⟩
Rsinθ. (240)
To ease the comparison with standard formulas, we use below the ∂notation
to denote partial derivatives. From (225) we have
∇w=∂w
∂θaθ+∂w
∂ϕaϕ=1
R∂w
∂θa⟨θ⟩+1
Rsin(θ)∂w
∂ϕa⟨ϕ⟩.(241)
Next, given a tangential vector field v, we introduce the physical components
v⟨θ⟩andv⟨ϕ⟩ofvby writing
v=u⟨θ⟩a⟨θ⟩+u⟨ϕ⟩a⟨ϕ⟩. (242)
Thephysicalcomponentsof v, arerelatedtothecontravariantcomponents vα

A.6 Proof of the identities (139)
Proof of (139)1.We write
Pdiv(P∇v) =Pdiv(∇v)−Pdiv(n⊗n∇v)
=P∆v−Pdiv(n⊗ ∇v⊤n). (247)
Then, since n·v= 0and∇n=P/R, we obtain ∇v⊤n=∇(n·v)−∇n⊤v=
v/R. Thus, we get Pdiv(n⊗ ∇v⊤n) div(n⊗v) =ndivv+∇nv=v/R, as
desired.
Proof of (139)1.We use (208) and (200) to write
Pdiv(∇v⊤P) =P(∇v⊤),αaα=P(aβ⊗v,β),αaα+∇v⊤divP
= (v,βα·aα)aβ+ (v,β·aα)Paβ
,α−(divn)∇v⊤n,(248)
where divP=−div(n⊗n) =−(divn)n− ∇nn=−(divn)n. Then, we
notice that
∇(divv) = (v,β·aβ),αaα= (v,βα·aβ)aα+ (v,β·aβ
,α)aα
= (v,βα·aα)aβ+ (v,β·aα
,β)aβ. (249)
Thus,
Pdiv(P∇v⊤)−∇(divv) = (v,β·aα)Paβ
,α−(v,β·aα
,β)aβ−(divn)∇v⊤n.(250)
Now, recalling that P=aγ⊗aγand using the identity aβ
,α·aγ=−aβ·aγ,α=
−aβ·aα,γ, which follows from (190) and (194), we find
(v,β·aα)Paβ
,α= (v,β·aα)(aγ⊗aγ)aβ
,α= (v,β·aα)(aβ
,α·aγ)aγ
= (v,β·aα)(aβ
,γ·aα)aγ= (v,β·(aα⊗aα)aβ
,γ)aγ
= (v,β·Paβ
,γ)aγ= (v,β·Paβ
,α)aα
= (v,β·aβ
,α)aα−(v,β·(n⊗n)aβ
,α)aα. (251)
54Moreover, since ∇n=∇n⊤,
−(v,β·(n⊗n)aβ
,α)aα=−(n·v,β)(n·aβ
,α)aα= (n·v,β)(n,α·aβ)aα
=∇n⊤∇v⊤n=−∇n∇nv. (252)
By combining (250), (251), and (252), we obtain
Pdiv(P∇v⊤)− ∇(divv) =−∇n2v−(divn)∇v⊤n
=−∇n2v+ (P:∇n)∇nv.(253)
Recalling ( cf.(220) and (221)) that, for a spherical surface, ∇n= (1/R)P
anddivn= 2/R, we obtain,
Pdiv(P∇v⊤)− ∇(divv) =−1
R2Pv+2
R2Pv=1
R2v,(254)
as required.
Proof of (139)3,4,5.First, we notice that
PdivP=−Pdiv(n⊗n) =−P((divn)n+∇nn) =0.(255)
Then, using (177), we obtain, for every scalar σ,
Pdiv(σP) =P∇σ+σPdivP=P∇σ. (256)
Now, (139)3,4are arrived at by letting σ= div vandσ=w/R, respectively.
Finally, to verify (139)5we use again (220) to compute
Pdiv(n⊗ ∇w) = ∆ wPn+P∇n∇w=1
RP∇w=1
R∇w. (257)
