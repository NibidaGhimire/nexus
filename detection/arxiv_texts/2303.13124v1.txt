Abstract. This paper is concerned with the inverse spectral problem for the t hird-order
diﬀerential equation with distribution coeﬃcient. The inverse proble m consists in the recovery
of the diﬀerential expression coeﬃcients from the spectral data of two boundary value problems
with separated boundary conditions. For this inverse problem, we s olve the most fundamental
question of the inverse spectral theory about the necessary an d suﬃcient conditions of solvabil-
ity. Inaddition, weprovethelocalsolvabilityandstabilityoftheinver se problem. Furthermore,
we obtain very simple suﬃcient conditions of solvability in the self-adjo int case. The main re-
sults are proved by a constructive method that reduces the nonlin ear inverse problem to a
linear equation in the Banach space of bounded inﬁnite sequences. I n the future, our results
can be generalized to various classes of higher-order diﬀerential o perators with integrable or
distribution coeﬃcients.

1 Introduction
This paper deals with the third-order diﬀerential equation
y′′′+(τ1(x)y)′+τ1(x)y′+τ0(x)y=λy, x∈(0,1), (1.1)
whereλis the spectral parameter, τ1∈L2(0,1),τ0∈W−1
2(0,1), that is, τ0=σ′
0,σ0∈L2(0,1),
and the derivative of L2-function is understood in the sense of distributions.
Westudytherecoveryofthecoeﬃcients τ0andτ1fromthespectraldataofthetwoboundary
value problems L1andL2for equation (1.1) with the following boundary conditions:
L1:y(0) = 0, y(1) =y′(1) = 0, (1.2)
L2:y(0) =y′(0) = 0, y(1) = 0. (1.3)
In recent years, spectral theory of the third-order diﬀerentia l operators with non-smooth
and distributional coeﬃcients attracts considerable attention of scholars (see, e.g., [1–7]). The
third-order diﬀerential equations arise in various physical applicat ions, e.g., in modelling thin
membrane ﬂow of viscous liquid and elastic beam vibrations (see [8–10 ]). The third-order
operators play an important role in the integration of the nonlinear B oussinesq equation (see
[11]).
The paper is concerned with the theory of inverse spectral proble ms, which consist in the
recovery of diﬀerential operators from their spectral charact eristics. The greatest success in
inverse spectral theory has been achieved for the second-orde r Sturm-Liouville operator −y′′+
1q(x)y(see the monographs [12–15] and references therein). The basic results for the inverse
Sturm-Liouville problems were obtained by the Gelfand-Levitan meth od [16]. However, this
method appeared to be ineﬀective for the higher-order diﬀerentia l operators:
y(n)+n−2/summationdisplay
k=0pk(x)y(k), n>2. (1.4)
Therefore, the investigation of inverse problems for operators ( 1.4) required the develop-
ment of new approaches. The general inverse problem theory for the higher-order diﬀerential
operators (1.4) with integrable coeﬃcients pkon a ﬁnite interval and on the half-line has been
constructed by Yurko [17–20] by the method of spectral mapping s. The central idea of this
methodconsists inthereduction ofanonlinear inverse problemtoalin ear equationinasuitable
Banach space. The main technical tool is the contour integration o f speciﬁc functions called the
spectral mappings, which ﬁrst appeared in the papers of Leibenso n [21,22]. Inverse scattering
problems for higher-order diﬀerential operators on the full line we re considered by Beals [23]
and his research group.
Recently, the study of inverse spectral problems beganfor highe r-order diﬀerential operators
with distribution coeﬃcients. In [24,25], the uniqueness theorems f or the recovery of such
operators on a ﬁnite interval and on the half-line have been proved . In [26], a constructive
approach for solving inverse spectral problems has been develope d. This approach can be
applied to various classes of diﬀerential operators with regular or d istributional coeﬃcients.
The methods of [24–26] rely on the regularization of diﬀerential ope rators with distribution
coeﬃcients (see [27–29]) and on the ideas of the method of spectra l mappings [20]. In the
reconstruction technique of [26], an important role is played by the s pectral data asymptotics
which have been deduced in [30] by using the Birkhoﬀ-type solutions recently obtained in [31].
However, necessary and suﬃcient conditions (NSC) of inverse pro blem solvability for higher-
order diﬀerential operators with distribution coeﬃcients, to the b est of the author’s knowledge,
have not been investigated yet.
Note that the NSC question is the most fundamental issue in the the ory of inverse spectral
problems. At the same time, this issue is usually the most diﬃcult for inv estigation. As an
example, let us consider the following well-known result for the Sturm -Liouville problem:
−y′′+q(x)y=λy, x∈(0,1), (1.5)
y′(0)−hy(0) = 0, y′(1)+Hy(1) = 0, (1.6)
whereq(x) is a real-valued function of L2(0,1),handHare real constants. Denote by {λn}∞

and{yn(x)}∞
n=1the eigenvalues of the problem (1.5)-(1.6) and the corresponding e igenfunctions
normalized by the condition yn(0) = 1. Consider the spectral data {λn,αn}∞

Liouville problem of form (1.5)-(1.6), the following conditions are necessary and suﬃcient:

2Proposition 1.1 is remarkable by the concise form of the NSC, which inc lude only simple
structural properties (1.7) and the asymptotics (1.8). For the ﬁ rst time, NSC of the inverse
Sturm-Liouville problem solvability have been obtained in the seminal pa per by Gelfand and
Levitan [16]. However, the results of [16] were slightly diﬀerent from Proposition 1.1, because
in [16] there was a gap between the necessary conditions and the su ﬃcient ones. By the
suﬃciency, more precise asymptotics were required. Later on, th at gap has been removed. The
NSC of Proposition 1.1 without the gap can be found, e.g., in [14]. This his torical example
shows that, even for the simplest second-order operator, obta ining NSC on the spectral data
required considerable eﬀort.
For the higher-order diﬀerential operators (1.4) with regular coe ﬃcients, the NSC of the
inverse problem solvability have been obtained by Yurko (see [20, Th eorem 2.3.1]). However,
in contrast to Proposition 1.1, Theorem 2.3.1 of [20] contains severa l hard-to-verify conditions.
First, it requires the existence of a model problem whose spectral data are asymptotically close
in some sense to the given data. Second, the unique solvability of the main linear equation is
required. Although this condition is unavoidable for non-self-adjoin t operators, it is important
tostudythespecial caseswhenthemainequationsolvabilitycanbed educed fromsomeeasy-to-
verify conditions. Third, the reconstruction formulas for the diﬀe rential expression coeﬃcients
in [20] have the form of series and, in Theorem 2.3.1, the a posteriori requirement of the series
convergence in the appropriate spaces is imposed. The reason of t his last requirement is that,
in Theorem 2.3.1, the coeﬃcients pkof (1.4) belong to non-Hilbert spaces. In Theorem 2.3.3
of [20], the NSC without such a posteriori requirement for the Hilber t space case are provided
without proofs. Thus, despite the fact that Yurko’s results were a great advance in the theory
of inverse problems for higher-order diﬀerential operators, the se results are not ﬁnal and the
study of such problems need to be continued. We also emphasize tha t Yurko’s results concern
only the case of regular coeﬃcients. For diﬀerential operators wit h distribution coeﬃcients,
the NSC question is completely open. In the author’s opinion, the stu dy of the distribution
coeﬃcient casewill helpnotonlytoconstruct thegeneral inverse p roblemtheoryofhigher-order
diﬀerential operators but also to overcome some diﬃculties which ar ise in the case of regular
coeﬃcients.
The goal of this paper is to obtain the NSC on the spectral data of t he third-order equation
(1.1). The third order is chosen because of the two reasons. First , for the third-order equation
(1.1), the inverse problem solvability conditions have been obtained in the simplest form (see
Theorem 2.5), without any hard-to-verify requirements. Second , the third order is convenient
for presentation of the proof technique, which in the future can b e generalized to arbitrary
orders. We treat the diﬀerential equation (1.1) with distribution co eﬃcient in terms of the
Mirzoev-Shkalikov approach [27,28]. For simplicity, we choose the bo undary conditions (1.2)-
(1.3) of the lowest possible orders. They are analogous to the Dirich let boundary conditions
y(0) =y(1) = 0 for the Sturm-Liouville operator. The other types of separ ated boundary
conditions can be studied similarly. Non-separated boundary condit ions (e.g., the periodic
ones) are fundamentally diﬀerent and so require a separate invest igation.
As spectral data, we take the eigenvalues {λn,k}and the weight numbers {βn,k}of the two
boundary value problems Lk,k= 1,2, and, for any pair of coinciding eigenvalues λn,1=λn,2,
their “common” weight number γnis added. The rigorous deﬁnition of the spectral data
is provided in Section 2. For solving the inverse problem, we use a cons tructive approach
of [20,26], which reduces the inverse problem to the so-called main eq uation in the Banach
space of bounded inﬁnite sequences. Applying this method, we prov e the main theorem (The-
orem 2.3) on the NSC of the inverse problem solvability in the general n on-self-adjoint case.
More precisely, using the main equation solution, we construct the f unctionsτ1andτ0as some
3series. Then, we prove the convergence of these series in the spa cesL2(0,1) andW−1
2(0,1),
respectively, relying on the spectral data asymptotics. Thereaf ter, we show that the spectral
data of the boundary value problems L1andL2with the constructed coeﬃcients τ0andτ1coin-
cide with the initially given numbers having prescribed asymptotical an d structural properties.
Furthermore, we consider the case of a small perturbation of the spectral data and obtain the
local solvability and stability of the inverse problem (Theorem 2.4). Fin ally, we investigate the
self-adjoint case, when the functions i τ0andτ1are real-valued. For this case, we obtain simple
suﬃcient conditions of the inverse problem solvability (Theorem 2.5). The central role in the
proofs of Theorem 2.5 belongs to the unique solvability of the main equ ation (Lemma 6.1).
In order to prove that lemma, we develop a new technique, which has no analogs in previous
studies, because the main equation solvability for odd orders has no t been investigated before.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the spectral data a re deﬁned, the main re-
sults arepresented, andthe proof strategy is brieﬂy described. In Section 3, we study structural
and asymptotical properties of the spectral data. In Section 4, we provide the construction of
the inverse problem main equation from [26]. Section 5 contains the pr oofs of Theorem 2.3 on
the NSC and of Theorem 2.4 on the local solvability and stability of the in verse problem. In
Section 6, the self-adjoint case is considered and Theorem 2.5 on th e suﬃcient conditions of
the inverse problem solvability for this case is proved. In Section 7, w e brieﬂy summarize our
results and discuss the possibility of generalizing them to arbitrary o rders.
Throughout this paper, we use the following notations :
•The prime y′(x,λ) denotes the derivative with respect to xand the dot ˙ y(x,λ), with
respect toλ.
•δk,jis the Kronecker delta.
•In estimates, the same symbol Cis used for various positive constants independent of x,

•Along with the diﬀerential expression ℓ(y) =y′′′+(τ1(x)y)′+τ1(x)y′+τ0(x)y, we consider
the diﬀerential expressions ˜ℓ,ℓ⋆,˜ℓ⋆,ℓN, andℓ†of the analogous form but with diﬀerent
coeﬃcients. We agree that, if a symbol αdenotes an object related to ℓ, then the symbols
˜α,α⋆, ˜α⋆,αN, andα†will denote the analogous objects related to ˜ℓ,ℓ⋆,˜ℓ⋆,ℓN, andℓ†,
respectively. Notethatthequasi-derivatives y[j]forℓ,˜ℓ,ℓ⋆, etc., will bedeﬁneddiﬀerently.
2 Main results
We start with the regularization of equation (1.1). Following the appr oach of Mirzoev and
Shkalikov [27,28], we understand equation (1.1) in terms of quasi-de rivatives. Let us brieﬂy
describe this approach.
The associated matrix F(x) = [fk,j(x)]3
k,j=1of equation (1.1) has the form
F(x) =
0 1 0
−(σ0+τ1) 0 1
0 (σ0−τ1) 0
, (2.1)
4whereσ0is any ﬁxed antiderivative of τ0. Note that σ0can be chosen up to a constant.
Nevertheless, the choice of σ0does not inﬂuence on the spectral data, which are deﬁned below
in this section.
The quasi-derivatives are deﬁned by the formulas
y[0]:=y, y[k]:= (y[k−1])′−k/summationdisplay
j=1fk,jy[j−1], k= 1,2,3. (2.2)
Thus
y[j]=y(j), j= 0,1, y[2]=y′′+(σ0+τ1)y, y[3]= (y[2])′−(σ0−τ1)y′.
Deﬁne the domain
DF:={y:y[k]∈AC[0,1], k= 0,1,2}.
Itfollowsfromtheresults of[28]that, forany y∈ DF, thediﬀerential expression ℓ(y) =y′′′+
(τ1(x)y)′+τ1(x)y+τ0(x)yproduces a regular generalized function and ℓ(y) =y[3]. Therefore,
a functionyis called a solution of equation (1.1) if y∈ DFandy[3]=λya.e. on (0,1).

Proceed with the deﬁnition of the spectral data. For k= 1,2, denote by {λn,k}∞
n=1the
eigenvalues of the corresponding boundary value problem Lk. One can easily check that the
eigenvalues {λn,k}∞
n=1coincide with the zeros of the characteristic function ∆ k,k(λ),k= 1,2.
Throughout the paper, we assume that the zeros of ∆ k,k(λ) are simple for k= 1,2. The
case of multiple eigenvalues can be studied by using the ideas of the pa pers [33,34], in which
the inverse spectral problems have been investigated for the non -self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville
operators. However, for the higher-order diﬀerential operato rs, the case of multiple eigenvalues
is much more technically complicated, so we conﬁne ourselves to the c ase of simple eigenvalues.
Anyway, it is possible that λn,1=λp,2for some indices n,p≥1. In this case, we reorder the
eigenvalues so that n=pand deﬁne the set
K:={n∈N:λn,1=λn,2}. (2.6)
Forn/\e}atio\slash∈K, we haveλn,1/\e}atio\slash∈ {λp,2}∞
p=1.
5Together with the eigenvalues, we will use additional spectral infor mation. In the inverse
problem theory of the higher-order diﬀerential operators, the m ost natural spectral character-
istics is the Weyl-Yurko matrix, which generalizes the Weyl functions of the Sturm-Liouville
operators (see [12,14]). For the higher-order diﬀerential opera tors with regular coeﬃcients, the
Weyl-Yurko matrix for the ﬁrst time was introduced by Yurko [17,20 ]. The Weyl-Yurko matrix
uniquely speciﬁes the diﬀerential operator in the general case, wh ile the spectral data used, e.g.,
in [21–23] are suﬃcient only under some restrictions on the spectra . For diﬀerential operators
with distribution coeﬃcients, the Weyl-Yurko matrices were used in [2 4–26].
For the third-order equation (1.1), the Weyl-Yurko matrix is deﬁne d as follows:
M(λ) =
1 0 0
M2,11 0
M3,1M3,21
, Mj,k(λ) =−∆j,k(λ)
∆k,k(λ),1≤k<j≤3. (2.7)
Clearly, the so-called Weyl functions Mj,k(λ), 1≤k < j≤3, are meromorphic in λand
their poles coincide with the eigenvalues {λn,k}∞
n=1. Deﬁne the weight numbers
βn,k:=−Res
λ=λn,kMk+1,k(λ) =∆k+1,k(λn,k)
˙∆k,k(λn,k), n∈N, k= 1,2, (2.8)
and˙∆(λ) =d
dλ∆(λ). It can be easily shown (see Lemma 3.1) that βn,1βn2= 0 if and only if
n∈K. Therefore, for n∈K, we putλn:=λn,1and deﬁne additional weight numbers
γn:=∆3,1(λn)
˙∆1,1(λn)ifβn,1= 0, (2.9)
γn:=C1(1,λn)
˙∆2,2(λn)ifβn,2= 0. (2.10)
Ifβn,1= 0 andβn,2= 0, then the deﬁnitions (2.9) and (2.10) coincide with each other. We
use the eigenvalues of the two problems L1,L2together with the deﬁned weight numbers as
the spectral data of the inverse problem.
Inverse Problem 2.1. Given the spectral data
S:=/parenleftbig
{λn,k}n∈N,k=1,2,{βn,k}n∈N,k=1,2,{γn}n∈K/parenrightbig
,
ﬁnd the coeﬃcients T:= (τ0,τ1) of equation (1.1).
We will write that T ∈Wifτ0∈W−1
2(0,1),τ1∈L2(0,1) and the zeros of ∆ k,k(λ) are
simple fork= 1,2. Along with T, we consider another coeﬃcient pair ˜T= (˜τ0,˜τ1) of class
W. We agree that, if a symbol αdenotes an object related to T, then the symbol ˜ αwith
tilde will denote the analogous object related to ˜T. Thus, the uniqueness theorem for Inverse
Problem 2.1 is formulated as follows.
Theorem 2.2. IfS=˜S, thenT=˜T, that is,τ0= ˜τ0inW−1
2(0,1),τ1= ˜τ1inL2(0,1). Thus,
the coeﬃcients Tof classWare uniquely speciﬁed by the spectral data S.
Inverse Problem 2.1 can be solved constructively by the method of [ 26]. Namely, the inverse
problem can be reduced to the linear main equation of form
(I−˜R(x))ψ(x) =˜ψ(x), x∈[0,1], (2.11)
6inthe space mof inﬁnitebounded sequences. The construction ofthemainequat ionis provided
in detail in Section 4. Here, we only mention that, for each ﬁxed x∈[0,1],ψ(x) and˜ψ(x) are
elements of m,˜R(x):m→mis a compact linear operator, and Iis the unit operator in m.
The element ˜ψ(x) and the operator ˜R(x) are constructed by the spectral data S, whileψ(x) is
the unknown element, which is related to the coeﬃcients T= (τ0,τ1) of equation (1.1). Thus,
solving the main equation (2.11), one can ﬁnd ψ(x) and then use it to obtain the solution of
the inverse problem.
Now we are ready to formulate the main theorem on the necessary a nd suﬃcient conditions
of the inverse problem solvability.
Theorem 2.3. For numbers S=/parenleftbig
{λn,k}n∈N,k=1,2,{βn,k}n∈N,k=1,2,{γn}n∈K/parenrightbig
to be the spectral
data corresponding to T= (τ0,τ1)∈W, it is necessary and suﬃcient to fulﬁll the following
conditions:
1. The following asymptotic formulas hold for n≥1,k= 1,2:

3. For each ﬁxed x∈[0,1], the operator (I−˜R(x)):m→mof the main equation (2.11)
has a bounded inverse.
The ﬁrst condition of Theorem 2.3 means that the values {λn,k}n∈N,k=1,2can be numbered
so that the asymptotic formulas (2.12) are valid. Such numbering is n on-unique, since the
asymptotics determines only the order of suﬃciently large eigenvalu es. We ﬁx a numbering
satisfying this property and also the condition n=pifλn,1=λp,2. This numbering speciﬁes
the setKby (2.6). By virtue of the asymptotics (2.12), the values {λn,k}are separated for
suﬃciently largevaluesof n, sothesetKisﬁniteandtheassumptionofsimplicity automatically
holds for large eigenvalues. Therefore, this assumption is not very restrictive.
Let us brieﬂy describe the proof strategy of Theorem 2.3. The pro of of the necessity consists
in the study of structural and asymptotical properties of the sp ectral data in Section 3. The
necessity of the third condition has been proved in [26]. The proof o f the suﬃciency is based
on the constructive solution of Inverse Problem 2.1. Since the oper ator (I−˜R(x)) is invertible,
then the main equation (2.11) has the unique solution ψ(x)∈m. Using the entries of ψ(x),
we construct the functions τ0andτ1by the reconstruction formulas derived in [26]. We show
thatτ0∈W−1
2(0,1) andτ1∈L2(0,1). Finally, we prove that the initially given numbers Sare
the spectral data of equation (1.1) with the constructed coeﬃcie ntsτ0andτ1. The last step
is the most technically diﬃcult. We need to check that some construc ted series are solutions
of equation (1.1) and, moreover, fulﬁll certain boundary condition s. But the derivatives of
these series do not converge and cannot be directly substituted in to equation (1.1). In order to
overcome these diﬃculties, we use the approximation approach, wh ich is described in detail in
Section 5.
Note that Theorem 2.3 contains the condition of the main equation un ique solvability (con-
dition 3). Conditions of such kind usually required for non-self-adjo int operators. For example,
the similar condition appears in the study of the non-self-adjoint St urm-Liouville operators
7(see [14, Theorem 1.6.3]). Nevertheless, it is important to investigat e special cases, when con-
dition 3 can be deduced from some easy-to-verify conditions. In th is paper, we consider the
two such cases:
1. Small perturbation of the spectral data.
2. The self-adjoint case.
For the case of a small perturbation, we obtainthe following theore m on the local solvability
and stability of Inverse Problem 2.1.
Theorem 2.4. Suppose that ˜T= (˜τ0,˜τ1)∈Wand˜K=∅. Then, there exists ε >0(which
depends on ˜T) such that, for any complex numbers S:={λn,k,βn,k}n∈N,k=1,2satisfying the
inequality

there exist coeﬃcients T= (τ0,τ1)∈Wsuch that Sare the spectral data of T. Moreover,

2(0,1)≤Cd(S,˜S), (2.14)
where the constant C >0depends only on ˜Tandε.
The case ˜K/\e}atio\slash=∅requires a separate investigation, because the equal eigenvalues ˜λn,1=˜λn,2
can split under a small perturbation of the spectra. In order to pr ove Theorem 2.4, we show
that (2.13) implies the conditions 1–3 of Theorem 2.3.
Now proceed to the self-adjoint case. Suppose that the function s iτ0(x) andτ1(x) are real-
valued. Then, the eigenvalues of the boundary value problems Lk,k= 1,2, can be numbered
so that

Strictly speaking, the diﬀerential expression ℓ(y) =y′′′+(τ1(x)y)′+τ1(x)y′+τ0(x)ybecomes
self-adjoint when multiplied by i. Then the boundary value problems L1andL2become adjoint
to each other, so their spectra are complex conjugate to each ot her. However, in order to
preserve similarity of notations with the previous studies [20,26], we do not multiply by i.
Thus, the spectra of L1andL2are symmetric to each other with respect to the imaginary axis.
Inviewof (2.15),itissuﬃcienttoconsideronlythespectrum {λn}∞
n=1,λn:=λn,1,βn:=βn,1.
As before, assume that the zeros {λn}∞
n=1of ∆1,1(λ) are simple. Since the eigenvalues are
numbered according to (2.15), it can happen that λn,1=λp,2forn/\e}atio\slash=p, that is,λn=−λp.
However, we are going to provide suﬃcient conditions of the inverse problem solvability, and we
additionally assume that λn/\e}atio\slash=−λpforn/\e}atio\slash=p. Anyway, it is possible that λn=−λnfor some
n∈N, thenβn= 0 andγn>0, whereγncan be deﬁned by either (2.9) or (2.10). Obviously

We will say that T ∈W+ifτ1∈L2(0,1),τ0∈W−1
2(0,1), the functions i τ0(x) andτ1(x) are
real-valued.
Theorem 2.5. LetS+be arbitrary numbers of form (2.16)satisfying the conditions:
1. The numbers {λn}n∈Nand{βn}n∈N\Ksatisfy the asymptotics (2.12)fork= 1.

3. Reλn≥0forn∈Nandγn>0forn∈K.
Then there exist a unique coeﬃcient pair T= (τ0,τ1)∈W+having the spectral data S+.
It is remarkable that Theorem 2.5 does not require the solvability of t he main equation. Its
unique solvability is proved in Section 6 by using the conditions 1–3 of Th eorem 2.5. The proof
is based on the construction of special meromorphic functions, on the contour integration in the
λ-plane, and on the application of the Residue Theorem. We emphasize that this construction
is novel and diﬀerent from the case of even-order diﬀerential ope rators. For even orders, the
number of the boundary value problems Lkis odd, and the middle problem is self-adjoint.
Consequently, the ideas analogous to the study of the second-or der operators can be applied.
For odd orders, there is no such “middle” self-adjoint problem. The refore, we impose the
condition Re λn≥0 for the two spectra to be separated by the imaginary axis. This se paration
plays an important role in the proof.
3 Spectral data properties
In this section, we study structural and asymptotical propertie s of the spectral data S. In ad-
dition, we deduce the uniqueness theorem (Theorem 2.2) from the r esults of [26]. Furthermore,
we deﬁne the Weyl solutions Φ k(x,λ) and Φ⋆
k(x,λ),k= 1,2,3, which play an important role in
the investigation of the inverse problem. The relationship between t he Weyl solutions and the
spectral data is established.
Consider the boundary value problems Lk,k= 1,2, deﬁned in Section 1 for equation (1.1)
with the coeﬃcients T= (τ0,τ1)∈W.
Lemma 3.1. βn,1βn,2= 0if and only if n∈K. Forn∈K,γn/\e}atio\slash= 0. Ifβn,1=βn,2= 0, then
the deﬁnitions (2.9)and(2.10)coincide with each other.
Proof.Suppose that λn,1=λn,2=:λn. Then ∆ 1,1(λn) = ∆ 2,2(λn) = 0. Hence, the relations
(2.4)-(2.5) imply C3(1,λn) = 0 andC2(1,λn)C′
3(1,λn) = 0. Consider the two possible cases:
Case 1.C2(1,λn) = 0, that is, ∆ 3,2(λn) = 0. Therefore, the Weyl function M3,2(λ) =
−∆3,2(λ)
∆2,2(λ)is analytic at λ=λn, soβn,2= 0. Note that, in this case, C1(1,λn)/\e}atio\slash= 0. Otherwise
C1(1,λn) =C2(1,λn) =C3(1,λn) = 0, which is impossible, since the functions Ck(x,λn),
k= 1,2,3, form a fundamental solution system of equation (1.1). Hence γn=C1(1,λn)
˙∆2,2(λn)/\e}atio\slash= 0.
Case 2.C′
3(1,λn) = 0 implies that ∆ 2,1(λn) = 0, so the Weyl function M2,1(λ) =−∆2,1(λ)
∆1,1(λ)
is analytic at λ=λn. Henceβn,1= 0. Then

2(1,λn)∆2,2(λn)+C[2]
3(1,λn)∆3,1(λn) = 1.
Since ∆ 1,1(λn) = ∆ 2,1(λn) = 0, then ∆ 3,1(λn)/\e}atio\slash= 0, soγn=∆3,1(λn)
˙∆1,1(λn)/\e}atio\slash= 0. If additionally
βn,2= 0, thenC2(1,λn) = 0. Therefore,
∆3,1(λn) =C1(1,λn)C′
2(1,λn),˙∆1,1(λn) =˙C3(1,λn)C′
2(1,λn).
9Consequently, in this case,∆3,1(λn)
˙∆1,1(λn)=C1(1,λn)
˙∆2,2(λn), that is, the deﬁnitions (2.9) and (2.10) of γn
are equivalent to each other.
It can be shown similarly that βn,1/\e}atio\slash= 0 andβn,2/\e}atio\slash= 0 ifn/\e}atio\slash∈K.
Recall that, under our assumptions, the eigenvalues {λn,k}are simple poles of the Weyl-
Yurko meromorphic matrix function. Consider the Laurent series
M(λ) =M/a\g⌊ra⌋ketleft−1/a\g⌊ra⌋ketright(λn,k)
λ−λn,k+M/a\g⌊ra⌋ketleft0/a\g⌊ra⌋ketright(λn,k)+M/a\g⌊ra⌋ketleft1/a\g⌊ra⌋ketright(λn,k)(λ−λn,k)+...,
and deﬁne the weight matrices
N(λn,k) := (M/a\g⌊ra⌋ketleft0/a\g⌊ra⌋ketright(λn,k))−1M/a\g⌊ra⌋ketleft−1/a\g⌊ra⌋ketright(λn,k). (3.1)
Proposition 3.2 ( [26]).Suppose that T= (τ0,τ1)and˜T= (˜τ0,˜τ1)belong toWandλn,k=
˜λn,k,N(λn,k) =˜N(λn,k)for alln∈N,k= 1,2. Thenτ0= ˜τ0inW−1
2(0,1)andτ1= ˜τ1in
L2(0,1). Thus, the spectral data {λn,k,N(λn,k)}n∈N,k=1,2uniquely specify the coeﬃcients τ0and
τ1of equation (1.1).
The following lemma establishes the relationship between the weight ma tricesN(λn,k) and
the weight numbers βn,k,γn.
Lemma 3.3. The following relations hold:

Proof.The relation (3.1) in the element-wise form yields
N(λn,k) =

By virtue of the deﬁnition (2.8), Mk+1,k/a\g⌊ra⌋ketleft−1/a\g⌊ra⌋ketright(λn,k) =−βn,k,k= 1,2. The technique similar
to the proof of Lemma 3.1 shows that

Proceed to the asymptotic properties of the spectral data.
Lemma 3.4. The eigenvalues {λn,k}n∈N,k=1,2and the weight numbers {βn,k}n∈N,k=1,2satisfy
the asymptotic relations (2.12).

the boundary conditions (1.2) and (1.3). The asymptotics of {λ0

by the standard method (see, e.g., [32, Chapter II]):

n,k=n2κn1,
{κn},{κn1} ∈l2, n∈N, k= 1,2.
This yields the claim of the lemma.
Denote by Φ k(x,λ),k= 1,2,3, the so-called Weyl solutions of equation (1.1) satisfying the
boundary conditions
Φ[j−1]
k(0,λ) =δk,j, j=1,k,Φ[3−j]
k(1,λ) = 0, j=k+1,3.
It can be easily shown that
Φk(x,λ) =Ck(x,λ)+3/summationdisplay
j=k+1Mj,k(λ)Cj(x,λ), k= 1,2,3. (3.2)
Consequently, the solutions Φ 1(x,λ) and Φ 2(x,λ) are meromorphic in λwith the simple
poles{λn,1}∞
n=1and{λn,2}∞
n=1, respectively. The solution Φ 3(x,λ)≡C3(x,λ) is entire in λ.
Using (3.2), (2.7), (2.8), and (2.9), one can easily establish the follow ing connection between
the Weyl solutions and the spectral data.
Lemma 3.5. The following relations hold:

The Weyl solutions Φ k(x,λ) are remarkable by their behavior as |λ| → ∞. In or-
der to describe this behavior, put λ=ρ3and divide the ρ-plane into the sectors Γ s=/braceleftBig
ρ∈C: argρ∈/parenleftbigπ(s−1)

,s=1,6. In each ﬁxed sector Γ s, denote by {ωk}3
k=1the roots of
the equation ω3= 1 numbered so that
Re(ρω1)<Re(ρω2)<Re(ρω3), ρ∈Γs. (3.3)
Clearly, the inequalities (3.3) become non-strict for ρ∈Γs.
11Lemma 3.6. In each closed sector Γs, the following estimate is fulﬁlled
|Φ[j]
k(x,ρ3)| ≤C|ρ|j−k+1|exp(ρωkx)|, k= 1,2,3, j= 0,1,2, x∈[0,1],|ρ| ≥ρ∗.
The proof of Lemma 3.6 is based on expansions of the Weyl solutions b y the fundamental
system of the Birkhoﬀ-type solutions. Such expansions have been estimated for diﬀerential
operators of arbitrary order in [24, Lemma 3] and in [26, Propositio n 2]. It is worth mentioning
that the estimates of Lemma 3.6 are similar to the ones for the case o f diﬀerential operators
with regular coeﬃcients (see formulas (2.1.20) in [20]), and there are no principal diﬀerences in
the proofs. Therefore, we omit the proof of Lemma 3.6.

The relationship between M(λ) andM⋆(λ) has been established in Section 2 of [26]. In
particular, for the third-order case, Lemma 2 of [26] implies the follo wing proposition.

124 Main equation
In this section, we provide the main equation of Inverse Problem 2.1. The main equation for
higher-order diﬀerential operators with distribution coeﬃcients in the general form has been
derived in [26]. Here, we introduce necessary notations and adapt t he results of [26] to our
case.
Consider equation (1.1) with the coeﬃcients T= (τ0,τ1)∈Wand the spectral data S.
Choose any coeﬃcients ˜T= (˜τ0,˜τ1) satisfying the following conditions:
1.1/integraltext
0τ1(x)dx=1/integraltext
0˜τ1(x)dx.
2.˜T ∈W.
3.{˜λn,1}∩{˜λn,2}=∅, that is, ˜K=∅.
4.˜λn,k/\e}atio\slash=λn0,k0,n,n0∈N,k,k0= 1,2.
We call ˜Tthe model problem. It can be shown that, for any values/integraltext1
0τ1(x)dxand
{λn,k}n∈N,k=1,2satisfyingtheconditions1and2ofTheorem2.3, amodelproblemwith theabove
properties exists. Indeed, in order to achieve the condition 1, one can take ˜τ1:=1/integraltext
0τ1(x)dxand
˜τ0:= 0. If the conditions 2–4 are not fulﬁlled, one can implement a minor sh ift of the spectral
data to achieve these conditions. On the other hand, the condition s 2–4 are not principal. If
some of them do not hold, the main results still remain valid, but the fo rm of the main equation
will be slightly diﬀerent.
Notethattheproblemswiththecoeﬃcients Tand˜Thave diﬀerent quasi-derivatives. Recall
that thequasi-derivatives relatedto Taredeﬁned via (2.2) byusing theentries oftheassociated
matrixF(x) given by (2.1). The quasi-derivatives related to ˜Tare generated similarly by the
following associated matrix:
˜F(x) =
0 1 0
−(˜σ0+ ˜τ1) 0 1
0 (˜σ0−˜τ1) 0
,(˜τ0= ˜σ′

Analogously to F⋆(x) (see (3.4)), deﬁne the matrix function ˜F⋆(x), the corresponding quasi-
derivatives, etc. For y∈ D˜Fandz∈ D˜F⋆, deﬁne the Lagrange bracket
/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tz,y/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht:=z[2]y−z′y′+zy[2],
wherez[2]=z′′+(˜σ0+ ˜τ1)z,y[2]=y′′−(˜σ0−˜τ1)y. Ifyandzsatisfy the relations ˜ℓ(y) =µy
and˜ℓ⋆(z) =λz, respectively, then

λn,k,0:=λn,k, λn,k,1:=˜λn,k, βn,k,0:=βn,k, βn,k,1:=˜βn,k,

(−1)kβn,k,ε˜D4−k,k0+1(x,λn,k,ε,λn0,k0,ε0),otherwise.
(4.5)
Note that the functions Φ 2(x,λ) and˜Φ2(x,λ) have the poles {λn,2,0}and{λn,2,1}, respec-
tively, and the functions Φ 3(x,λ) and˜Φ3(x,λ) are entire, so /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{t0/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htis absent in the deﬁnition of
˜ϕn,k,ε(x) and can be removed in the deﬁnition of ϕn,k,ε(x) in all the cases except n∈K,k= 1,
ε= 0. Analogously, in view of (4.3) and (4.4),

Hence, the functions ˜G(n,k,ε),(n0,k0,ε0)(x) are correctly deﬁned for ( n,k,ε),(n0,k0,ε0)∈Vand
/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{t0/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htis necessary only for n∈K, (n,k,ε) = (n,2,0), (n0,k0,ε0) = (n,1,0).
The following proposition has been proved in [26] by the contour inte gral method.
Proposition 4.1 ( [26]).For(n0,k0,ε0)∈V,x∈[0,1], the following relation holds:
ϕn0,k0,ε0(x) = ˜ϕn0,k0,ε0(x)+/summationdisplay
(n,k,ε)∈V(−1)εϕn,k,ε(x)˜G(n,k,ε),(n0,k0,ε0)(x). (4.6)
The relations (4.6) can be treated as an inﬁnite linear system of equa tions with respect
toϕn,k,ε(x), (n,k,ε)∈V. The elements ˜ ϕn0,k0,ε0(x) andG(n,k,ε),(n0,k0,ε0)(x) are constructed by
using the model problem ˜Tand the spectral data Sand˜Sof the both problems, while the
elementsϕn,k,ε(x) are related to the desired coeﬃcients T. Thus, the system (4.6) can be used
for solving Inverse Problem 2.1. However, it is inconvenient to use (4 .6) as the main equations
of the inverse problem, because the series in (4.6) converges only “ with brackets”:
/summationdisplay
(n,k,ε)∈V=/summationdisplay
(n,k)/parenleftBigg/summationdisplay
ε=0,1(...)/parenrightBigg
.
Therefore, in [26], the system (4.6) has been transformed to a linea r equation in the Banach
spacemof bounded inﬁnite sequences. Let us provide that transform.

ξn:=/summationdisplay
k=1,2(n−2|λn,k−˜λn,k|+n−3|βn,k−˜βn,k|), n∈N. (4.7)
It follows from the asymptotics (2.12) that {nξn} ∈l2. By Lemma 7 of [26], the following
estimates hold:
|ϕn,k,ε(x)| ≤Cwn,k(x),|ϕn,k,0(x)−ϕn,k,1(x)| ≤Cwn,k(x)ξn, (4.8)

For brevity, put ψv(x) :=ψn,k,ε(x),˜ψv(x) :=˜ψn,k,ε(x),˜Rv0,v(x) :=˜R(n0,k0,ε0),(n,k,ε)(x),v=
(n,k,ε),v0= (n0,k0,ε0),v,v0∈V. Then, the relations (4.6) can be rewritten as follows:
ψv0(x) =˜ψv0(x)+/summationdisplay
v∈V˜Rv0,v(x)ψv(x), v0∈V (4.11)
In [26], the following estimates have been obtained:
|ψv(x)|,|˜ψv(x)| ≤C,|˜Rv0,v(x)| ≤Cξn
|n−n0|+1, v,v 0∈V, (4.12)
It follows from (4.12) that the series in (4.11) converges absolutely and uniformly with
respect tox∈[0,1].
Consider the Banach space mof bounded inﬁnite sequences α= [αv]v∈Vwith the norm

The main result of this section is formulated as follows.
Proposition 4.2 ( [26]).For each ﬁxed x∈[0,1], the linear operator ˜R(x)is compact in m
and can be approximated by ﬁnite-rank operators. Furthermo re, the following relation holds
(I−˜R(x))ψ(x) =˜ψ(x), x∈[0,1], (4.14)
whereIis the unit operator in m.
The relation (4.14) is called the main equation of Inverse Problem 2.1. I t plays animportant
role in the proofs of Theorems 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 in the next sections.
155 Proofs of Theorems 2.3 and 2.4
In this section, we prove Theorem 2.3 on the necessary and suﬃcien t conditions of the inverse
problem solvability. Then, as a corollary, we obtain Theorem 2.4 on the local solvability and
stability.
Supposethat S= ({λn,k}n∈N,k=1,2,{βn,k}n∈N,k=1,2,{γn}n∈K)arethespectraldataofthecor-
responding boundary value problems for equation (1.1) with the coe ﬃcientsT= (τ0,τ1)∈W.
Thenecessity oftheconditions1and2inTheorem 2.3(asymptotics a ndstructural propertiesof
the spectral data) is given by Lemmas 3.1 and 3.4. The invertibility of t he operator ( I−˜R(x))
from the main equation (4.14) has been proved in [26]. The inverse ope rator (I−˜R(x))−1
has been found explicitly in the case when the diﬀerential expression coeﬃcients are known
(see Theorem 1 in [26]). Thus, the necessity part of Theorem 2.3 has been already proved.
Therefore, in this section, we focus on the proof of the suﬃciency .
LetSbe any numbers satisfying the conditions 1–3 of Theorem 2.3. We hav e to prove the
existence of some coeﬃcients T= (τ0,τ1) such that the numbers Sare their spectral data. Let
us outline the proof.
1. Thesolution ψ(x)ofthemainequation(4.14)isconstructedanditspropertiesares tudied.
2. Using the entries of ψ(x), we ﬁnd the functions τ0andτ1by the reconstruction formulas
(5.4) and (5.5).
3. We prove that τ0∈W−1
2(0,1) andτ1∈L2(0,1) (Lemma 5.1).
4. We prove that the initially given numbers Sare the spectral data of equation (1.1) with
the constructed coeﬃcients τ0andτ1(Lemma 5.2). For this purpose, the approximation
approach is used.
(a) Wedeﬁne the“truncated”spectral data SNby (5.9)and(5.10)andprovetheunique
solvabilityofthecorrespondingmainequation, which turnsintoaﬁnit elinearsystem
(Lemma 5.3).
(b) We construct the functions τN
1andτN
0analogous to τ1andτ0, respectively, and the
functions ΦN
k(x,λ),k= 1,2,3, by the formula (5.19). Then, we prove that ΦN
k(x,λ)
are the Weyl solutions and SNare the spectral data of TN= (τN
0,τN
1) (Lemmas 5.5
and 5.6). The advantage of considering the “truncated” data SNis that the series
for ΦN
k(x,λ) are ﬁnite and so these functions can be easily substituted into equ ation
(1.1) with the coeﬃcients TN.
(c) It is shown that τN
1→τ1andτN
0→τ0in the corresponding spaces as N→ ∞
(Lemma 5.7).
(d) We prove the stability of the spectral data with respect to τ1andτ0(Lemma 5.8).
(e) The fact that SN→Sﬁnishes the proof of Lemma 5.2.
Now, proceed to the detailed proof. By virtue of the condition 3, th e operator ( I−˜R(x))
has a bounded inverse. Therefore, the main equation (4.14) has a u nique solution in mfor each
ﬁxedx∈[0,1]:
ψ(x) = (I−˜R(x))−1˜ψ(x), ψ(x) = [ψv(x)]v∈V.
Note that the estimates (4.12) on the entries ˜ψv(x) and˜Rv0,v(x) are similar to the ones
for the Sturm-Liouville operator with regular potential q∈L2(see, e.g., [14, Section 1.6.1]).
16Therefore, repeating the proofarguments ofLemma 1.6.7in[14], we easily show thatthe entries
ψv(x) of the main equation solution have the following properties:
ψv(x)∈C1[0,1],|ψ(ν)(x)| ≤Cnν,|ψv(x)−˜ψv(x)| ≤Cχn,|ψ′
v(x)−˜ψ′
v(x)| ≤C,(5.1)

χn:=/parenleftBigg∞/summationdisplay

Using the entries ψv(x), construct the functions ϕn,k,ε(x) by inverting the formula (4.9):

The functions ˜ ηn,k,ε(x) are deﬁned by using the model problem and the spectral data S, so
they can be estimated similarly to (4.8):
˜ηn,k,ε∈C1[0,1],|˜η(ν)

Lemma 5.1. The series (5.4)converges in L2(0,1)and the formula (5.5)deﬁnes the function

Using the estimates (5.3) and (5.7), we obtain
|S1| ≤C∞/summationdisplay
n=1ξn+C∞/summationdisplay
n=1nξnχn. (5.8)
Recall that {nξn} ∈l2and{χn} ∈l2. Hence, the both series in the right-hand side of (5.8)
converge, so the series S1converges absolutely and uniformly with respect to x∈[0,1]. For
the series S2, the convergence in L2(0,1) follows from Lemma 8 in [26]. Therefore, the series
forτ1(x) in (5.4) converges in L2(0,1).
Thus ˆτ′
1∈W−1

The series T1, similarly to S1, converges absolutely and uniformly with respect to x∈[0,1].
By virtue of Lemma 8 from [26], the series T2converges in L2(0,1) with some regularization
constantsan,k,ε:/summationdisplay
V(˜ϕ′
n,k,ε(x)˜ηn,k,ε(x)−an,k,ε)∈L2(0,1).
Anyway, the constants an,k,εare unimportant because of the diﬀerentiation in (5.5). The
series/summationtext
V(−1)εϕn,k,ε˜ηn,k,εconverges absolutely and uniformly on [0 ,1]. Hence, the function τ0
deﬁned by (5.5) belongs to W−1
2(0,1).
Now consider equation (1.1) with the coeﬃcients T= (τ0,τ1) deﬁned via (5.4)–(5.5) by
using the initially given data S. In order to ﬁnish the proof Theorem 2.3, it remains to prove
the following lemma.
Lemma 5.2. Sare the spectral data of T= (τ0,τ1).
For suﬃciently large N∈N(N≥maxK), deﬁne the data

Repeat the arguments of Section 4 using the same model problem ˜Tand the data SN
instead of S. Then, instead of the inﬁnite system (4.11), we obtain the ﬁnite linea r system

v∈VN˜Rv0,v(x)ψN
v(x), v0∈VN, x∈[0,1], (5.11)
where
VN:={(n,k,ε)∈V:n≤N}.
18Lemma 5.3. For every suﬃciently large N, the system (5.11)is uniquely solvable for each
x∈[0,1].
Proof.Consider an auxiliary operator
˜RN(x) = [˜RN

˜RN
(n0,k0,ε0),(n,k,ε)(x) =/braceleftBigg
0, n>N,
˜R(n0,k0,ε0),(n,k,ε)(x),otherwise.(5.12)
Clearly, the operator ˜RN(x) is ﬁnite-rank, and the operator ( I−˜RN(x)) has a bounded
inverse if and only if the matrix of the system (5.11) is non-singular.
Using (4.12) and (5.12), we estimate

Recall that {nξn} ∈l2. Hence
/⌊ard⌊l˜R(x)−˜RN(x)/⌊ard⌊lm→m=o/parenleftbig

, N→ ∞.
Since theoperator ( I−˜R(x)) hasa boundedinverse, thenso does ( I−˜RN(x)) forsuﬃciently
largeN. Consequently, equation (5.11) is uniquely solvable.
The proof of Lemma 5.3 readily implies the following corollary.
Corollary 5.4. The solution {ψN
v(x)}v∈VNof the ﬁnite system (5.11)can be found as the
entries with the indices v∈VNof the solution ψN(x)∈mof the equation
(I−˜RN(x))ψN(x) =˜ψ(x), x∈[0,1],
where the operator ˜RN(x)is deﬁned by (5.12). Moreover, the following estimate holds:

In the next two lemmas, we prove that ΦN

Lemma 5.5. For suﬃciently large N,k= 1,2,3, andλ/\e}atio\slash∈ {λn,j}∪{˜λn,j}, we have ΦN

Proof.Recall that ˜Φk(.,λ)∈ D˜F, so˜Φk(.,λ)∈W2
1[0,1],k= 1,2,3. Consequently, ˜ψv∈
W2
1[0,1] and˜Rv0,v∈W3
1[0,1] forv0,v∈VN. Hence, the entries ˜ψN
vof the ﬁnite system (5.11)

1[0,1]. Therefore, ϕN

1[0,1] and˜P(n,k,ε),k0∈W3

(n,k,ε)∈VN,k0= 1,2,3. Using (5.14), (5.15), and (5.19), we conclude that ˆ τN

(n,k,ε),k0(x) = ˜ηn,k,ε(x)˜Φk0(x).
Below inthis proof, we omit theupper index Nandthearguments ( x) and(x,λ) forbrevity.

Since ˜ϕn0,k0,ε0∈ DF, then ˜ϕ[2]

relations (5.24) can be treated as a ﬁnite linear system similar to (5.11 ) with the invertible
matrix of class W3

Lemma 5.6. For suﬃciently large N, the functions ΦN
k(x,λ),k= 1,2,3, fulﬁll the boundary
conditions
(ΦN
k)(j−1)(0,λ) =δk,j, j=1,k,(ΦN
k)(3−j)(1,λ) = 0, j=k+1,3. (5.28)
Thus,ΦN
k(x,λ),k= 1,2,3, are the Weyl solutions of equation (5.16). Moreover, SNare the
spectral data of TN.
21Proof.Let us focus on the proof of the boundary conditions (5.28) at x= 1, which is more
technically complicated. The boundary conditions (5.28) at x= 0 can be checked by direct
calculations. For brevity, we omit the upper index N. For simplicity, consider the case βn,1=
βn,2= 0 for alln∈K. The other cases require technical modiﬁcations.
Step 1. Let us prove that

3(1,λn) = 0, n∈K, ν= 0,1.(5.29)

˜Φ⋆
2(1,λ) = 0, we obtain

Note that ˜Φ⋆[1]

3(1,λn,1,1) = 0. In addition, for λ=λn0,1,1, we have
˜Φ′
2(1,λn0,1,1) = 0, so
˜D2,2(1,λn,2,ε,λn0,1,1) = 0,˜D3,2(1,λn,1,1,λn0,1,1) = 0 ifn0/\e}atio\slash=n. (5.32)
It can be shown that
βn,1,1˜D3,2(1,λn,1,1,λn,1,1) = 1.
Hence, (5.30) implies

Step 3. Let us prove that Φ 2(1,λ)≡0, Φ1(1,λ)≡0, and Φ′

1(1,λ) = 0,ν= 0,1, and the
relations
˜D(ν)

Step 4. Summarizing the results of steps 1–3, we conclude that ΦN

fulﬁll the boundary conditions (5.28). Together with Lemma 5.5, this implies that ΦN

Proof.Recall that ψ(x) andψN(x) are the solutions of the main equations ( I−˜R(x))ψ(x) =
˜ψ(x) and (I−˜RN(x))ψN(x) =˜ψ(x), respectively, and the operators ˜R(x) and˜RN(x) fulﬁll the
estimate /⌊ard⌊l˜R(x)−˜RN(x)/⌊ard⌊lm→m≤εN, whereεN=o(N−1),N→ ∞(see Corollary 5.4). Hence,
for suﬃciently large N, we have /⌊ard⌊lψ(x)−ψN(x)/⌊ard⌊lm≤CεN. The functions ϕn,k,εandϕN
n,k,ε,
n≤N, are obtained from ψ(x) and˜ψN(x), respectively, by the corresponding formulas (5.2)

Lemma 5.8 is proved by the well-known method for obtaining continuou s dependence of
the spectral data on the boundary value problem coeﬃcients (see [35]). In recent years, this
methodhasbeenactively developed forvariousclasses ofdiﬀerent ial operators(see, e.g.,[6,36]).
Therefore, here we outline the proof of Lemma 5.8 brieﬂy.
Proof of Lemma 5.8. Recall that the eigenvalues {λn,k}coincide with the zeros of the charac-
teristic functions ∆ k,k(λ), which are composed as some determinants of the functions C[j]
k(1,λ)
(see formulas (2.4) and(2.5)). It followsfromthedeﬁnition ofthe s olutionsCk(x,λ),k= 1,2,3,
that the vectors of their quasi-derivatives solve the initial value pr oblems (2.3), where σ0(x) is a
ﬁxed antiderivative of τ0(x), soσ0andτ1belong toL2(0,1). Obviously, the functions C[j]
k(1,λ),
k= 1,2,3,j= 0,1,2, depend continuously on the coeﬃcients ( σ0,τ1) and analytically on λ.
Consequently, so do the functions ∆ j,k(λ), 1≤k<j≤3, deﬁned by (2.4) and (2.5).
Suppose that k∈ {1,2}is ﬁxed. Let λn,kbe a zero of ∆ k,k(λ) of multiplicity mn,k, and
let the disk dδsatisfy the conditions of this lemma. Clearly, there exists a constan tc0>0
such that |∆k,k(λ)| ≥c0on the boundary of dδ. By the hypothesis of the lemma, τN
0→τ0in
W−1
2(0,1) asN→ ∞. Therefore, since σ0is a ﬁxed antiderivative of τ0, then one can choose
antiderivatives σN
0of the functions τN
0so thatσN
0→σ0inL2(0,1) asN→ ∞. Consequently, it
follows from the above arguments, that ∆N
k,k(λ)→∆k,k(λ) asN→ ∞uniformly with respect
toλ∈dδ. Hence
|∆N
k,k(λ)−∆k,k(λ)|<c0, λ∈dδ,
for all suﬃciently large values of N. Rouche’s Theorem implies that ∆N
k,k(λ) has exactly mn,k
zeros (counting with multiplicities) in dδ. This proves the ﬁrst assertion of the lemma.
Recall that the weight numbers βn,kandγnare deﬁned by (2.8) and (2.9)-(2.10), respec-
tively, as the residues of some meromorphic functions composed of C[j]
k(1,λ). This implies the
assertions 2 and 3 of the lemma.
26Proof of Lemma 5.2. Consider the functions τ1andτ0which are constructed by the initially
given data Sby the formulas (5.4) and (5.5), respectively. Denote by {λ•
n,k}n∈Nthe eigenvalues
of the corresponding problem Lk,k= 1,2, for equation (1.1). We have to prove that the
eigenvalues {λ•
n,k}coincide with the values {λn,k}of the data S. For this purpose, consider
the data SNdeﬁned by (5.9) and the functions τN
1andτN
0constructed by the formulas (5.14)
and (5.15), respectively. By virtue of Lemma 5.7, we have τN
1→τ1inL2(0,1) andτN
0→τ0
inW−1
2(0,1) asN→ ∞. Lemma 5.6 implies that SNare the spectral data of TN= (τN
0,τN
1),
in particular, {λN
n,k}∞
n=1are the eigenvalues of the problem LN
kfork= 1,2. Due to the ﬁrst
assertion of Lemma 5.8, the eigenvalues of LN
kconverge to the eigenvalues of Lk, that is,
λN
n,k→λ•
n,kasN→ ∞, for each ﬁxed n∈Nandk= 1,2. At the same time, it follows from
(5.10) that λN
n,k→λn,kasN→ ∞. Henceλ•
n,k=λn,k. Thus, the problems Lk,k= 1,2, have
simple spectra, so the spectral data S•ofThave the structure similar to S:
S•=/parenleftbig
{λn,k}n∈N,k=1,2,{β•
n,k}n∈N,k=1,2,{γ•
n}n∈K/parenrightbig
.
Successively applying the second and the third assertions of Lemma 5.8 together with (5.9)
and (5.10), we conclude that β•
n,k=βn,kfor alln∈N,k= 1,2 andγ•
n=γnforn∈K. This
concludes the proof.
Lemma 5.2 ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 2.3.
Proof of Theorem 2.4. Let˜Tsatisfy thehypothesis ofTheorem 2.4. Then, the conditions1 and
2 of Theorem 2.3 are valid for the spectral data ˜S={˜λn,k,˜βn,k}n∈N,k=1,2of˜Tby the necessity.
Therefore, the inequality (2.13) for suﬃciently small ε>0 implies that the conditions 1 and 2
of Theorem 2.3 hold for S={λn,k,βn,k}n∈N,k=1,2. Construct the main equation (4.14) by using
the data Sand the model problem ˜T. Comparing (2.13) and (4.7), we conclude that
/radicaltp/radicalvertex/radicalvertex/radicalbt∞/summationdisplay
n=1(nξn)2≤d(S,˜S)≤ε. (5.38)
Using (4.12) and (5.38), we obtain the estimate
/⌊ard⌊l˜R(x)/⌊ard⌊lm→m≤sup
n0≥1∞/summationdisplay
n=1Cξn
|n−n0|+1≤Cε.
Therefore, for suﬃciently small ε >0, we have /⌊ard⌊l˜R(x)/⌊ard⌊lm→m≤1
2for allx∈[0,1]. Hence,
the operator ( I−˜R(x)) has a bounded inverse. Thus, the data Sfulﬁll the conditions 1–3 of
Theorem 2.3. This implies the existence of the coeﬃcients T= (τ0,τ1)∈W, for which Sare
the spectral data ( K=∅).
The estimates (2.14) can be easily proved by using (5.38) and by follow ing the proof of
Lemma 5.1.
6 Self-adjoint case
The goal of this section is to prove Theorem 2.5 on the suﬃcient cond itions of the inverse prob-
lem solvability. The central part in the proof is taken by Lemma 6.1 on t he unique solvability
of the main equation (4.14).
27We begin with some preliminaries. Along with equation (1.1) having the co eﬃcients T=

ℓ†(y) =y′′′+(τ1(x)y)′+τ1(x)y′−τ0(x)y=λy, x∈(0,1).

Obviously,F†(x) =F⋆(x), whereF⋆(x) was deﬁned in (3.4). Therefore, there is the one-to-
one correspondence y(x,λ) =z(x,−λ) between solutions y(x,λ) andz(x,λ) of the equations
ℓ†(y) =λyandℓ⋆(z) =λz, respectively. Hence M†

Corollary 3.8, we obtain the following relations between the spectral data ofT†andT:

n,1=−λn,2, λ†
n,2=−λn,1, β†
n,1=−βn,2, β†
n,2=−βn,1, γ†
n=γn.(6.1)
Now suppose that i τ0(x) andτ1(x) are real-valued functions. Then T†=Tand so (6.1)
implies
λn,1=−λn,2, βn,1=−βn,2.
As before, we assume that the eigenvalues {λn,k}∞
n=1for eachk∈ {1,2}are simple. How-
ever, the eigenvalue order changes. Since we suppose that λn,1=−λn,2, thenλn,1=λp,2not
necessarily implies n=p. Therefore, we need some changes in the deﬁnition of γn.
Putλn:=λn,1,βn:=βn,1, and deﬁne the index set
K+:={n∈N:∃p=p(n)s.t.λn=−λp}.
Ifβn= 0, then deﬁne γnby formula (2.9). If n∈K+andβn/\e}atio\slash= 0, thenλp(n),2=λn,1and
βp(n),2=−βp(n)= 0, so we deﬁne γnby (2.10). It follows from (6.1) that γn=γp(n)forn∈K+.
Ifn=p(n), thenλnis purely imaginary, βn= 0,γnis real, and, moreover, it can be shown
thatγn>0. Our main goal is to prove Theorem 2.5, so below we conﬁne ourselve s to the case
n=p(n) for alln∈K+. Obviously, in this case, K=K+.
Proceed to the proof of Theorem 2.5. Let S+= ({λn}∞
n=1,{βn}n∈N\K,{γn}n∈K) be arbitrary
numbers satisfying the hypothesis of Theorem 2.5. Denote
λn,1:=λn, λn,2=−λn, n∈N,

Consider the data S= ({λn,k}n∈N,k=1,2,{βn,k}n∈N,k=1,2,{γn}n∈K). Choose a model problem
˜T= (˜τ0,˜τ1) satisfying the conditions of Section 4 and the additional condition t hat i˜τ0(x) and
˜τ1(x)arereal-valued. FollowingthestepsofSection4,constructtheo perator˜R(x):m→mand
the elements ˜ψ(x)∈mand consider the main equation (4.14). For the proof of Theorem 2.5 ,
the following lemma on the unique solvability of the main equation is crucia l.
Lemma 6.1. Under the conditions of Theorem 2.5, the main equation (4.14)is uniquely solv-
able for each ﬁxed x∈[0,1].
28Proof.Letx∈[0,1] be ﬁxed. By virtue of Proposition 4.2, the operator ˜R(x) has the approx-
imation property. Therefore, in view of Fredholm’s Theorem, it is suﬃ cient to prove that the
homogeneous equation
(I−˜R(x))ζ(x) = 0, (6.3)
has the unique solution ζ(x) = 0 inm.
Letζ(x) = [ζv(x)]v∈V∈mbe a solution of (6.3). Then
ζv0(x) =/summationdisplay
v∈V˜Rv0,v(x)ζv(x),|ζv0(x)| ≤C, v 0∈V.
Analogously to (5.2), deﬁne

.
Thus,ζn,k,ε(x) is the analog of ψn,k,ε(x) andzn,k,ε(x) is the analog of ϕn,k,ε(x) for the homo-
geneous equation (6.3). Consequently, we have

Using (4.5) and taking into account that βn,k,0= 0 fork∈K, we can consider the following
system instead of (6.4):

where
V−:=V\{(n,k,0):n∈K, k= 1,2}, zn(x) :=zn,2,0(x), n∈K.
Obviously, if the solution ( {zn,k,ε(x)}(n,k,ε)∈V−,{zn(x)}n∈K) of the system (6.6)–(6.7) is zero,
then the solution {zn,k,ε(x)}(n,k,ε)∈Vof (6.4) is also zero, and so does ζ(x). Let us prove this.
Consider the functions

Zk+1(x,λn,k,ε) =zn,k,ε(x),(n,k,ε)∈V−, Z 3(x,λn) =zn(x), n∈K.(6.9)
Furthermore, the function Z3(x,λ) is entire in λ, and the functions Z1(x,λ) andZ2(x,λ) are
meromorphic with the simple poles {λn,1,0}n∈Nand{λn,2,0}n∈N\K, respectively. Calculations

Taking the inequalities (6.17) and (6.18) into account, we conclude th at Γ2(x,λ)≡0 for
iλ∈R. By the analytic continuation principle, we have Γ 2(x,λ)≡0,λ∈C. The relations
(6.10) and βn,2,0/\e}atio\slash= 0 implyzn,2,0(x) = 0 forn∈N\K. It follows from (6.9) that zn,1,ε(x) =
Z2(x,λn,1,ε) = 0 for (n,1,ε)∈V−. Then, the relation (6.16) implies

n∈Kγn|zn(x)|2= 0.
Hencezn(x) = 0 for n∈K. In view of (6.9), the entire function Γ 3(x,λ) has zeros

Using the asymptotics (2.12), one can show that
|P(ρ3)| ≥C|ρ|−2|exp(ρω3)|, ρ∈Γs,δ. (6.19)
Clearly, the functionZ3(x,λ)
P(λ)is entire. The estimates (6.12) for k0= 3 and (6.19) imply

P(ρ3)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤C

By Liouville’s Theorem, we conclude that Z3(x,λ)≡0 and sozn,2,1(x) =Z3(x,λn,2,1) = 0,
n∈N. Thus,zn,k,ε(x) = 0 for all ( n,k,ε)∈V. This yields the claim of the lemma.
Proof of Theorem 2.5. It follows from the hypothesis of Theorem 2.5 and Lemma 6.1 that the
dataSfulﬁll the conditions of Theorem 2.3. By virtue of Theorem 2.3, there exist coeﬃ-
cientsT= (τ0,τ1)∈Wwith the spectral data S. It remains to show that T ∈W+, that
is, iτ0(x), τ1(x)∈R. For this purpose, consider the coeﬃcients T†= (−τ0,τ1) and the corre-
sponding spectral data S†. Recall that the spectral data SandS†are related by (6.1). Since
(6.2) holds and γn∈R,n∈K, we obtain S=S†. By virtue of the uniqueness theorem
(Theorem 2.2), this implies T=T†, which concludes the proof.
317 Conclusion
In this paper, the necessary and suﬃcient conditions of the invers e problem solvability are
obtained for the third-order diﬀerential equation (1.1). We treat equation (1.1) by using the
regularization approach of Mirzoev and Shkalikov [27,28]. The proo f of the main result (The-
orem 2.3) is based on the constructive method of [20,26]. This metho d reduces the inverse
problem to the linear main equation (4.14) in the Banach space of boun ded inﬁnite sequences
m. Our NSC include asymptotic and structural properties of the spe ctral data and the re-
quirement of the main equation unique solvability. In addition, we have studied the two special
cases, in which the latter requirement can be achieved. The ﬁrst on e is the case of a small
perturbation of the spectral data. The investigation of this case implies Theorem 2.4 on the
local solvability and stability of the inverse spectral problem. The se cond case is the self-adjoint
one. For this case, we prove Theorem 2.5, which provides very simple suﬃcient conditions on
the spectral data.
The results of this paper can be extended to various classes of high er-order diﬀerential
operators generated by diﬀerential expression of form
ℓs(y) :=y(s)+⌊s/2⌋−1/summationdisplay
k=0(τ2k(x)y(k))(k)

, (7.1)
wheres≥3, the coeﬃcients {τν}s−2
ν=0can be integrable or distributional, and the notation ⌊a⌋
means rounding a real number adown. However, such extension will be non-trivial and will
cause additional diﬃculties. Let us discuss some of them.
Ifthecoeﬃcients {τν}s−2
ν=0aresuﬃciently smooth, then thespectral dataasymptotics cont ain
a large number of constant coeﬃcients (see, e.g., [20]):

j=0bj,kn−j+n−(p+1)κ0
n,k/parenrightBigg
.
The constants cj,kandbj,kare related to the coeﬃcients {τν}s−2
ν=0, and it is a technical
algebraic problem to obtain these relations. Additionally, in order to g et NSC, one has to
invent an algorithm for determining whether given numbers cj,kandbj,kcan be the coeﬃcients
in the spectral data asymptotics for any boundary value problems or not. Consequently, for
technical reasons, it is more convenient to consider the case of dis tribution coeﬃcients {τν}s−2
ν=0.
It is important to note that the Mirzoev-Shkalikov regularization ha s been obtained for
the caseτν=σ(iν)
ν,i2k+j=l−k−j,l=⌊s/2⌋,k≥1,j= 0,1,σν∈L2(0,1) ifs= 2l
andσν∈L1(0,1) ifs= 2l+ 1 (see [27,28]). For diﬀerential expression coeﬃcients of higher
singularity orders, there are no regularization results. However, in the Mirzoev-Shkalikov case
fors≥3 and in the cases of lower singularity orders (e.g., s= 2land eitherσν∈L2(0,1) or
σν∈W−1
2(0,1) for allν=0,s−2), a step-by-step process of recovering the coeﬃcients σs−2,
σs−3, ...,σ1,σ0is needed (see [26]). This makes it diﬃcult to obtain NSC on the spectra l data,
since additional requirements should be imposed at each step.
The proof of the main equation solvability in the self-adjoint case (Th eorem 2.5) can be
generalized to arbitrary odd orders. For even orders, the proof technique will be diﬀerent.
In [18], the unique solvability of the main equation has been proved for diﬀerential operators
32with regular coeﬃcients of arbitrary even order on the half-line. Fo r the ﬁnite interval, there
are no such results. For odd orders, to the best of the author’s k nowledge, the proof of the
main equation solvability in this paper is fundamentally new and has no an alogs in previous
studies.
Certainly, one can replace the boundary conditions (1.2) and (1.3) b y separated boundary
conditions of higher orders. But then the question of recovering t he boundary condition coef-
ﬁcients arises, which is non-trivial for diﬀerential operators with d istribution coeﬃcients. As
an example, consider the Sturm-Liouville equation (1.5) with potentia lq∈W−1
2(0,1) and with
the Robin boundary conditions
y[1](0)−hy(0) = 0, y[1](1)+Hy(1) = 0,
wherey[1]:=y′−σy,q=σ′. Then the both coeﬃcients handHcannot be uniquely recovered
from the spectral data (see [37]), because the spectral data a re invariant with respect to the
shiftσ:=σ+c,h:=h−c,H:=H+c. For higher orders, the situation is richer. The
uniqueness issues have been studied in [25], while the reconstructio n of the boundary condition
coeﬃcients requires a separate investigation.
