transform electromagnetic potentials deﬁned in one gauge t o corresponding potentials deﬁned
in the other gauge. It is shown that such a function cannot exi st.
1.Introduction
Despite electromagnetic potentials are treated within the classical electrodynamics as a math-
ematical tool to calculate the physical quantities, the EM ﬁ elds, computation of these potentials
is mostly forced procedure. The Maxwell equations are solve d by means of the wave equations
for the scalar ϕand vector Apotentials. As it had been shown by Lorenz still in 1867, solu tions
of these wave equations plus the condition connecting the po tentials (in the Gauss units),
(1.1) ∇·A+1
c∂ϕ
∂t= 0,
fully correspond to the Maxwell equations [1].
According to [2], Lorentz re-opened the gauge condition in 1 904 by writing that in order
to have the potentials satisfy the ordinary wave equations t hey must be related by (1.1). He
discusses the arbitrariness in the potentials and then stat es ’every other admissible pair A′and
ϕ′can be related to the ﬁrst pair A′andϕ′via the transformations

So the gauge function in the Lorenz gauge obeys the homogeneo us wave equation.
After these results of Lorentz, the function χLis called the gauge function . Let us note that
Lorentz introduced transformations (1.2) for the potentia ls those obey the wave equations (p.
157 of [4]), or deﬁned in the Lorenz gauge.
Essential property of transformations (1.2) is that both se ts of the potentials, ϕ,Aand
ϕ′,A′, give the same values of the EM ﬁelds since the derivatives of the gauge function mutually
compensate each other in the Maxwell equations.
Later these transformations have been extended to other gau ges, ﬁrst of all, the Coulomb
gauge. The latter is associated with Maxwell who derived the wave equation for the magnetic
ﬁeld using the condition (in modern notation)
(1.4) ∇·A= 0.

that was later called as the Coulomb gauge . Let us apply the transformations of the same form
as for the gauge function in the Lorenz gauge,
(1.5) A′
C=AC+∇χC,
whereAC,A′
Care the vector potentials in the Coulomb gauge. Using the gau ge condition (1.4),
one has
(1.6) ∇·A′
C=∇·AC+∇2χC= 0,
Since both ∇·A′
Cand∇·ACshould be equal to zero in this gauge, one obtains that the
Coulomb gauge function obeys the Poisson equation ∇2χC= 0.
Although most problems in electrodynamics are solved in the Lorenz gauge, where the wave
equations for the potentials are separated, there are some p roblems that are solved in another
gauge. For example, due to the diﬃculties of quantizing scal ar photons, some problems of
quantum electrodynamics are solved in the Coulomb gauge, wh ere the scalar potential is con-
sidered as a static non-quantizable quantity. The use of diﬀe rent gauges raises the question, are
the electromagnetic ﬁelds calculated from the potentials d etermined in diﬀerent gauges equal?
The study of this problem raises another question: is it poss ible to ﬁnd a function that trans-
forms electromagnetic potentials deﬁned in one gauge into e lectromagnetic potentials deﬁned in
another gauge. It will be shown below that such a function can not exist in the general case.
Since the most used gauges are the Lorenz and Coulomb ones, it is appropriate to ﬁnd a
function that transforms the potentials of these gauges.
2.The condition of the gauge function existence.
If one intends to seek such a gauge function, ﬁrst of all one sh ould be sure that the derivatives
of this function do not enter into the Maxwell equations. So i t is reasonable to choose the same
form for transformations of the potentials as it was introdu ced by Lorentz, or
ϕC−ϕL=−1
c∂χ
∂t, (2.1)
AC−AL=∇χ, (2.2)
where the indices ”C” and ”L” refer to the potentials deﬁned i n the Coulomb and Lorentz
gauges, and χis the required function. This function must satisfy the mai n requirement for the
gauge function, namely, in the Maxwell equations, the deriv atives of χwill eliminate each other
and the gauge function cannot be included in the Maxwell equa tions.
At the same time, fulﬁllment of Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) provides the equivalence of the EM ﬁelds
calculated in both gauges. Actually,
∇ϕC−∇ϕL=−1
c∇∂χ
∂t,
1
c∂AC
∂t−1
c∂AL
∂t=1
c∇∂χ
∂t.
Term-by-term summation of the above equations gives
∇ϕC+1
c∂AC
∂t−∇ϕL−1
c∂AL
∂t= 0→EL−EC= 0.
In order for the above equation to be valid, one needs to ﬁnd th e functions χ, or at least show
that this function exists. To realize this statement, let us analyze the restrictions that are
imposed on χby Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2).3
Calculation of the divergence of both parts of Eq. (2.1) give s,
(2.3) ∇·AC−∇·AL=∇·∇χor−∇·AL=∇2χ,
and after application of the Lorenz gauge condition to the lhsof the above equation, one has
(2.4)1
c˙ϕL=∇2χ.
The gauge function can be reconstructed from Eq. (2.4), so on e obtains,
(2.5) χ=1
4π/integraldisplay∇2χ(r′)
|r−r′|d3r′=1
4πc/integraldisplay˙ϕL(r′,t)
|r−r′|d3r′.
The last integral in (2.5) diverges as ln rsince ˙ϕL≃1/r2but let us skip this defect for a while.
Since the diﬀerence AC−ALis given by the solution of the wave equation with the rhsequal
to1
c∇∂ϕC
∂t(Eq. (3.3) of [5]), and AC−AL=∇χ, one has,
(2.6) ∇χ(r,t) =1
4πc/integraldisplay[∇˙ϕC]ret
|r−r′|d3r′.
Thus, gradient of the gauge function should be equal to the in tegral in rhsof (2.5) and at the
same time this gradient should be equal to the integral in rhsof (2.6). Therefore, these integrals
should be equal one other,
1
4πc/integraldisplay[∇r′˙ϕC(r′,t′]ret
|r−r′|d3r′=1
4πc∇r/integraldisplay˙ϕL(r′)
|r−r′|d3r′.
where the argument t′inϕCcorresponds to the retarded time – actually, the change t′→tr=
t−|r−r′|/cshould be made after preforming all operations on Φ C
Typically, the scalar potential in the Lorenz gauge is expre ssed via the retarded time (for
example, the Li´ enard-Wiechert potentials). However, if ϕLis expressed in the present time
coordinates, Eq. (2.7) is simpliﬁed. Since in this case ˙ ϕLis function only of r′andt,
∇r/integraldisplay˙ϕL(r′,t)
|r−r′|d3r′=/integraldisplay∇r′˙ϕL(r′,t)
|r−r′|d3r′,
and
(2.7)1
4πc/integraldisplay[∇r′˙ϕC(r′,t]ret
|r−r′|d3r′=1
4πc/integraldisplay∇r′˙ϕL(r′,t)
|r−r′|d3r′.
The above relation must be fulﬁlled with necessity. If it is n ot fulﬁlled, it means that there is
no function providing the transformation of the potentials from the Coulomb to Lorenz gauge,
and otherwise.
It is diﬃcult to verify this relation, since the integrals in it are too cumbersome. However,
these integrals can be computed in simplest case of uniform m otion of a single classical charge.
Let us show how the integrals of Eq. (2.7) can be computed.
3.Computation of the integrals.
Veriﬁcation of the fulﬁllment of relation (2.7), for exampl e, for the xcomponent of ∇Φ, can
be made by consideration of potentials created by a classica l charge which is at rest until t= 0,
and then begins to move with constant velocity valong the xaxis.
In this case, only the xcomponent of integrals can have non-zero values. Due to symm etry,
theyandzcomponents should be equal to zero.4 VLADIMIR ONOOCHIN
If the charge starts its motion from the point r= 0, the scalar potentials in two gauges will

whereqis a charge of the particle and Θ( t) is the step function. Calculation of ∂x˙Φ for these

[(x−vt)2+[1−(v/c)2](y2+z2)]5/2.(3.1)
Here, it should be noted some feature of establishing the sca lar potentials in space after change
of motion of the charge at t= 0. If Φ C(r,t) is establishing in all space instantaneously, it is not
the case for Φ L(r,t).
’Switching on’ the potential of moving charge at a point O(ﬁg 1) with r= 0 at the instant
t= 0 means that a spherical ’wave of establishing’ of this pote ntial in space begins to extend
fromOand at an instant ta front of this wave will be at R=ct.
Let us choose the origin of the coordinate system is located a tr′= 0 and a value of the
external variable r= 0. Then in spherical coordinates, r′, θ, φthe region of integration is the
same for both integrals (ﬁg. 1). For Φ L, this region is determined by condition that at the
interval [0; t] the potential of the moving charge can be established insid e the sphere with the
radiusr′=R=ct. For Φ C, this region is determined by the argument of the Θ function,
t−r′/c >0.
The symbol [ ] retin Eq. (2.7) means that the nominator in its lhsdepends on the retarded time,
ortr=t−r′/c. Then in the spherical coordinates, the integrals are writt en as1

Both integrands contain the regular and singular terms, or t he terms which make the above
integrals belong to improper ones. The latter appear due to t he second derivative of the scalar
potential, and special procedure has been developed for pro cessing divergent (singular) terms
(Ch. IV.5.5 of [6]). Thus, computation of the integrals with these terms gives

So account of the singular terms of the integrands is equal fo r both integrals. Now it is nec-
essary to compute accounts of regular terms. After change of variable cos θ=ξ, the ﬁrst of

Since the results of integrations of Eqs. (3.3) and (3.4) are not equal each other, and since the
gauge function should correspond to both these expressions , such a gauge function cannot exist
in the general case.6 VLADIMIR ONOOCHIN
4.Conclusions.
In this work it is considered a problem of existence of so-cal led gauge function that is able to
transform the electromagnetic potentials deﬁned in one gau ge to the corresponding potentials
deﬁned in another gauge. Except the only requirement caused by the’gauge invariance ’, namely,
that the Maxwell equations cannot contain any gauge functio n including its derivatives, no other
speciﬁcation of the form of the gauge function is used in the p resented analysis.
Meanwhile, the requirement of the gauge invariance , which determines the relationship of
potentials with derivatives of χ–function, is suﬃciently strong to determine that this func tion
must bedeﬁnedthroughscalar potentials. Asaresult, it tur nsout that this functionisexpressed
in terms of the scalar potential in the Coulomb gauge, Eq. (2. 6) and at the same time it is
expressed through the scalar potential in the Lorenz gauge, Eq. (2.5). The compatibility of
these two conditions leads to Eq. (2.7), which means that if t his equation holds, then the gauge
function can be found from any of Eqs. (2.6) and (2.5). But if E q. (2.7) does not hold, then the
gauge function cannot exist.
However, there is one obstacle to verify a validity of Eq. (2. 7) in the general case. The reason
for this is that for such a verifying one needs to know the expl icit form of the potentials of
the charge in an arbitrary motion, written in the present tim e variables2. This explicit form is
known, the expressions for the Li´ enard–Wiechert potentia ls. But these expressions are written
in terms of retarded variables. To check the fulﬁllment of Eq . (2.7), it is necessary to know the
expressions for the scalar potentials written in the presen t time variables.
But even if Eq. (2.7) does not hold in one particular case, thi s is suﬃcient to conclude that
the needed connection between Φ Cand ΦLdoes not exist. Such a special case is considered in
Sec. III of this work and it is shown that connection between t he scalar potentials deﬁned in two
gauges actually does not exist. Thus, even whether a problem of divergence of the integral (2.5),
detrmining the gauge function, is ignored, the obtained res ult allows us to conclude that the
required connection is generally invalid and, therefore, t here is no gauge function that provides
the transformation of electromagnetic potentials.
