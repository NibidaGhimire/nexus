1 INTRODUCTION
Scalingrelationsarefundamentalmodalitiesbetweendiﬀerentphys-
ical properties of a certain class of astrophysical objects. Under-
standing these scaling relations is crucial to understanding the core
physicsthatgoverntheformationandevolutionoftheseobjects.Over
the past few decades, scaling relations for galaxy clusters have been
studied extensively with a lush set of multiple frequency band ob-
servations.Theserelationsmainlyrelateclustermassestimatesfrom
weaklensing(vonderLindenetal.2014;Mantzetal.2015;Hoekstra
et al. 2015) to their electromagnetic signal in the X-ray (Vikhlinin
et al. 2009; Mantz et al. 2010b, 2016), millimeter (Bleem et al.
2015; Planck Collaboration et al. 2016b; Hilton et al. 2018) and
optical (Eisenstein et al. 2011; Rykoﬀ et al. 2014, 2016; Abbott
et al. 2018) wavelengths. Studying these scaling relations have sig-
niﬁcantly improved our understanding of galaxy formation at the
high-mass end (Bryan & Norman 1998; Kravtsov & Borgani 2012)
★E-mail: ycwang19@stanford.eduas well as enabling more precise cluster cosmology with better halo
mass estimation (Mantz et al. 2010a; Allen et al. 2011).
Extendingthesescalingrelationsfromgalaxyclusterstothemas-
sive galaxies is both challenging and important for understanding
theformationofmassivegalaxies.Thankstorecentdedicatedeﬀorts
targetingearly-typegalaxies(ETGs,e.g.Kormendyetal.2009),ob-
serversarenowstartingtostudyETGscalingrelationsatasimilarly
detailed level as galaxy clusters. It is found that ETG mass and their
relativelyhotinterstellarmedium(ISM)andcircumgalacticmedium
(CGM) also follow scaling relations, although in most cases with
diﬀerent slope and scatter from those of groups and clusters. These
include the X-ray luminosity–mass relation (O’Sullivan et al. 2001;
Davidetal.2006;Borosonetal.2011;Kim&Fabbiano2013;Sarzi
et al. 2013; Kim & Fabbiano 2015; Goulding et al. 2016; Forbes
et al. 2017; Babyk et al. 2018; Kim et al. 2019b), X-ray luminosity–
temperature relation (David et al. 2006; Boroson et al. 2011; Kim
& Fabbiano 2015; Goulding et al. 2016; Babyk et al. 2018; Kim
etal.2019b),andtemperature–massrelation(O’Sullivanetal.2003;
Goulding et al. 2016; Babyk et al. 2018). The latest data products
from Chandra also provide 2D spectral maps of the X-ray gas in
ETGs (Kim et al. 2019a), enabling analyses of the spatial distribu-

tion and dynamical properties of hot gas in ETGs. Diverse shapes
of gas temperature proﬁles have been found from these X-ray spec-
tral maps which indicate distinct sources of internal (feedback) and
external (environment) heating being present for the X-ray gas in
ETGs (Kim et al. 2020).
Interestingly,manyoftheserecentstudies(Kim&Fabbiano2013,
2015; Goulding et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2019b) also found that the
scatterintheseETGX-rayscalingrelationstendstoincreasetowards
lower masses ( log10¹𝑀5𝑅eMº6115). This indicates potential
secondary processes driving the diﬀerences in the luminosity and
temperatureoftheISMandCGMataﬁxedmassscale.WhileWhite
& Sarazin (1991) found that galaxies at a ﬁxed 𝐵-band luminos-
ity often have lower X-ray luminosity in denser environments, more
recent literature (e.g. Goulding et al. 2016) ﬁnds a negligible corre-
lationbetweenthescatteringastemperatureandenvironment.Since
supernovafeedback(alongwithothertypesofstellarfeedback,e.g.,
Springel&Hernquist2003;Springeletal.2005;Ceverino&Klypin
2009)andactivegalacticnucleifeedback(AGN,e.g.,DiMatteoetal.
2005; Croton et al. 2006; Fabian 2012) can act as heat sources and
drive outﬂows of the ISM and CGM, their interplay could lead to
theobservedscatterinX-rayluminosityortemperature(Babyketal.
2018).
However, the debate is still open in both observational and theo-
retical fronts on whether stellar or AGN feedback is the dominant
source of the low-mass-end scatter for ETG X-ray scaling relations.
Davidetal.(2006),usingaheatingrateargument,suggestedthatSu-
pernovaIa (SNIaforshort) feedbackdominatesover AGNfeedback
in gas heating and driving outﬂows in low mass ETGs from Chan-
dra. Similarly, Pellegrini (2011) argued for SNIa as the dominant
source of internal gas heating using semi-analytic modeling in mas-
sive ETGs. Nevertheless, Choi et al. (2015) found in cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations that a combination of kinetic and ther-
mal AGN feedback can signiﬁcantly reduce ETG X-ray luminosity
at ﬁxed mass. Forbes et al. (2017) further compared ETGs from the
SLUGGSsurveytoChoietal.(2015)andconcludedthatAGNisthe

dividualETGs,suggestedthatSNIaandAGNaﬀectdistinctaspects
oftheETGgas:whilegasheatingisdominatedbySNIa,AGNfeed-
back signiﬁcantly reduces 𝐿X. Kim et al. (2019b) further supports
thestellarfeedback-drivenheatingscenariowhereChandra-observed
ETGswithhigherstellarmassestendtohavehigher 𝐿Xatﬁxeddark
matter halo masses. Moreover, Kim et al. (2020) found that hot gas
cores in Chandra ETGs are mostly related to recent star formation
and hence stellar feedback is dominant instead of AGN feedback
or gravitational heating. In addition to stellar and AGN feedback,
other physical diﬀerences such as the inner density proﬁle or the
dynamicalstate(Pellegrini1999;Sarzietal.2013;Kim&Fabbiano
2015; Kauﬀmann et al. 2019) of the ETG can also lead to system-
atic diﬀerences in X-ray luminosities at the low-mass end, pointing
to secondary heating eﬀects from galactic rotation and the shape of
thegravitationalpotentialwhichcouldalsoaddtothelow-mass-end
scatter.
Advancements in cosmological simulations over the past two
decades have revolutionized our understanding of galaxy evolution
(seee.g.Vogelsbergeretal.2020aforareview).Tofurtherelucidate
theoriginoftheseETGX-rayscalingrelations,weusealegacyETGs

stellarproperties,anddarkmatterfractions(Lovelletal.2018;Wangetal.2019,2020,2022).OurworkfurtherextendsthepreviousX-ray

Naiman et al. 2018; Nelson et al. 2018; Pillepich et al. 2018b;

2010; Weinberger et al. 2020). It steps up from the original Illustris
Simulations (Vogelsberger et al. 2013; Torrey et al. 2014; Vogels-
berger et al. 2014a,b; Genel et al. 2014; Sĳacki et al. 2015; Nelson
et al. 2015) and improves upon the sub-grid physics of the stellar
and AGN feedback models (Weinberger et al. 2017; Pillepich et al.
2018a). These improvements lead to more realistic predictions in
terms of observed galaxy properties and demonstrates the capacity
of IllustrisTNG to shed light on the underlying physical processes
shaping these properties. Some of the comparison works with ob-
servationsincludethegalaxymass–metallicityrelation(Torreyetal.

cles based on their intrinsic luminosity using the stellar population
synthesis(SPS)model /g.pc/a.pc/l.pc/a.pc/x.pc/e.pc/v.pc (Bruzual&Charlot2003).Wealso
apply a semi-analytic dust attenuation model as in Xu et al. (2017)
to account for dust absorption, emission, and scattering.
The main classiﬁcation criterion for a central galaxy to be early-
type is based on their SDSS 𝑟-band rest-frame luminosity proﬁles.
We perform both single and double-component luminosity proﬁle
template ﬁtting to enable more robust classiﬁcation. The single-
component ﬁt consists of ﬁtting either exponential (S ´ersic𝑛=1)
or de Vaucouleurs (S ´ersic𝑛=4) proﬁle templates. The double-
componentﬁtcombinesadeVaucouleursandanexponentialproﬁle

only better ﬁtted by a single de Vaucouleurs proﬁle but also have
¡50%bulge ratio from the two-component ﬁt in all three (box
𝑥𝑦𝑧axes) projections. This leads to a sample of559 central ETGs
in the mass range of log10¹𝑀Mº2» 107119¼(corresponding
to [36104,58105] stellar particles) at 𝑧=0. The𝑀500mass

cluster scale temperatures). Instead, we implement an approximate

simulated ETGs seems to increase towards lower masses, which we
investigate further in the following sections (3.2, 3.3).

galaxies (slope of 4.7, Goulding et al. 2016) from the MASSIVE
Survey (Ma et al. 2014). The agreement in the 𝐿X–𝑇slslope with
observations for a statistical sample of simulated ETGs from a 3D
cosmological simulation is also a big step up from previous hydro-
simulation results such as Ciotti et al. (2017) who used 2D zoom-in
approaches.
Although the slope of the simulated ETGs is close to the
observationally-derivedvalues,themeantemperatureatﬁxed 𝐿X500

𝐿X500–𝑀tot¹5𝑅eºrelation closely resembles the observed scaling
relations, this systematic oﬀset is mainly due to a factor 3colder
CGMinIllustrisTNGETGs(thedotted-dashedbluelineintheright
panel of Fig. 2 matches well with observations), that are most likely
due to limitations in the current AGN feedback model and will re-
quire future improvements to alleviate the discrepancy. Pop et al.
(2022) found a similar issue with IllustrisTNG (in TNG300) pre-
dicting cooler X-ray temperatures of gas than in observations (see
their section 4.3 for a discussion on potential model limitations).
TheyfoundthatthespectroscopictemperaturederivedfromMOCK-
X in a more massive sample ( 𝑀500¡1013M,𝑇Xspec¡05keV

derestimated by a factor 2, which is consistent with the 03
dex underestimation seen in our sample at the high- 𝑇slend. The
spectroscopic-like temperature deﬁnition further enhances the un-
derestimation due to the 𝑇 34weighting, and that underestimation
is actually a bit stronger in IllustrisTNG compared to other cosmo-
logicalhydrodynamicsimulations(seeFigureA5inLeeetal.2022).
Despite the cooler-than-observed temperatures for most of our
simulated ETGs, there are three signiﬁcant outliers in 𝑇sl500at the

Observationally-derived dark matter fractions are not free from
systematics, and the range of dark matter fraction values can be
dependentonthespeciﬁcapproachusedformeasuringthetotalmass

Alabietal.(2017)whousedGCkinematics.SincemostoftheETG
masses in Kim et al. (2019b) come from GC kinematics in Alabi

lowerdarkmatterfractionsthanIllustrisTNGETGsisconsistentwith
expectations. Thus, if one adopted satellite kinematics-based dark
matter fractions (mostly larger than 50%) from Wojtak & Mamon

AsKimetal.(2019b)discoveredthat Δ𝐿Xvariesdiﬀerentlywith

atic trends of Δ𝐿X500with the total mass density proﬁle for our

total density proﬁles of ETGs is well-studied through observed stel-
lar kinematics modeling (Thomas et al. 2007; Tortora et al. 2014;
Poci et al. 2017; Bellstedt et al. 2018; Derkenne et al. 2021), strong

covariances in gas fractions, stellar ages, and recent AGN activities

Supermassiveblackholes(SMBH)atthecentersofhaloescanreg-

Since the CGM (including the ISM within the central galaxy) is
directly impacted by active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, we
expect the eﬀects of AGN feedback to also manifest in the scatter
of𝐿X500forETGs.TheIllustrisTNGAGNfeedbackmodel(Wein-
berger et al. 2017, 2018) features two channels: the radiative (pure
thermal) mode that resembles high-accretion-rate thermal feedback
common to high redshift quasars, and the low-accretion-rate kinetic
mode that approximates centrally driven winds in quiescent AGN
(no thermal energy injection). The former deposits thermal energy
isotropicallytothesurroundingISMofthecentralSMBH,whilethe
latter injects kinetic kicks to the surrounding gas in random direc-
tions. For massive galaxies with 𝑀&1011M, the kinetic mode

Furthermore,throughradiativeheating,turbulenceinjection,kineticexpulsion of gas through winds, AGN feedback also lowers the star

In this scenario, lower mass ETGs that up-scatter in 𝐿X500experi-
enced less AGN kinetic feedback historically and retained a larger
gas reservoir, leading to higher gas mass fraction. This is consistent

violent AGN (kinetic) feedback leads to younger stellar populations
due to less eﬃcient quenching. The consequence of having younger
stars is stronger stellar feedback that can further heat up the ISM
and CGM, leading to higher 𝐿X500. Moreover, the fact that these
up-scatterETGsin 𝐿X500enduphavinglarger 𝑓gasalsofuelsmore
recentAGN accretion and hence higherrecent feedback energies

Conversely, one could argue that stronger recent(instead of his-

inant driver for creating the scatter in 𝐿X500at the low-mass end.
SincemostofourETGshavethermallyquiescentAGNinthelast1.3

if stronger stellar feedback is the core driver of the scatter in 𝐿X500

to lower𝑓gasin up-scatter 𝐿X500ETGs, which is opposite from the

and recent AGN kinetic feedback energies in Fig. 4 are not driven
by variations in SMBH mass, but rather the diverse accretion and
merger histories of the SMBH leading to diﬀerent feedback his-
tories that shape the scatter in 𝐿X500. Our ﬁndings here are also
consistent with the previous study of Truong et al. (2021), who
showed that IllustrisTNG galaxies having 𝐿X500.1041erg s 1
have signiﬁcantly larger scatter in 𝑀BHat ﬁxed𝐿Xthan galaxies
with𝐿X500&1041erg s 1,leadingtoaweakercorrelationbetween
𝐿Xand𝑀BH.Although many observations suggest that the internal heating of

et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2019b, 2020), our ﬁndings above dive deeper
and provide a more comprehensive picture about the fundamental
physics behind the scatter in 𝐿X. Weaker kinetic AGN feedback in
the past could enhance star formation and gas fractions, leading to
present-day younger stellar populations and as a consequence, drive
stronger stellar feedback that heat up the gas. However, this is qual-
itatively diﬀerent from stellar feedback being the intrinsic source of
feedback that leads to higher 𝐿X. Since observations are limited to
staticAGNproperties,theymayseemobviouswhencomparedtoob-

Finally,thecolormapsintheinsetplotsinFig.4markoutthevari-

signiﬁcantcorrelationbetween Δ𝐿X500withthetotaldensityproﬁle

the total density proﬁle in massive ETGs are mainly dominated by
gas-poor mergers at 𝑧.1. AGN feedback only impacts the total
density proﬁle at 𝑧&1when the ETGs were still quite gaseous,
while the eﬃcient kinetic mode feedback can impact the small frac-
tion of diﬀuse gas all the way to 𝑧=0, shapingΔ𝐿X500. These

their dis-correlation a natural outcome.

We also show their distances to the host FoF group and major
subhaloes of those clusters (subhaloes by 𝑧=0) that they interacted
with as a function of time (blue curves, right 𝑦-axis in Fig.5). The

demonstrate this process, we plot the mass-weighted temperature
maps at𝑧=105020in the surroundings of each ETG in Fig. 6.
We only include gas cells associated with the ETGs and the larger
cluster they interacted with in these temperature maps. We analyze
how the three ETG formation histories impact the heating of their
gas on a case-by-case basis:
ETG A ( S/u.pc/b.pc/f.pc/i.pc/n.pc/d.pc ID 410700) interacted with parts of a FoF
group that has a 𝑧=0 log10¹𝑀200Mº=1395. Speciﬁcally, it

(white squares) started interacting with outskirt gas in subhalo 𝑟2at
𝑧=05, heated up and remained to be surrounded by extended hot
gas from the host halo of the larger FoF group even after exiting at
𝑧=0.
ETGB( S/u.pc/b.pc/f.pc/i.pc/n.pc/d.pcID482814)interactedwiththelargestcluster

history comes from the ﬁnal approach of the ETG onto the most
massive cluster, when the other two subhaloes already ﬁnished their

ETG C ( S/u.pc/b.pc/f.pc/i.pc/n.pc/d.pc ID 486341) interacted directly with the host
halo of a FoF group that has a 𝑧=0 log10¹𝑀200Mº=1432.

splashETGsthatarerelativelylowinmass,theirchangeinpotential
energy are insuﬃcient to cause the order-of-magnitude increase in

shock (Birnboim & Dekel 2003) in the host halo can heat the ac-
creted gas to the virial temperature of the host halo. Although some
of the encounters above do not penetrate deep into the halo, we ﬁnd
thattheextendedgasoutsideof 𝑅200ofthelargerclusterstheseETGs

For massive 𝑀¡1010Mgalaxies experiencing tidal in-

icant removal of the total gas content. Indeed, in Fig. 2 left panel,
the𝐿Xof these three outlier ETGs is all below the best-ﬁt 𝐿X500–
𝑀5𝑅erelation, indicating gas stripping in all three cases. Therefore,
the combination of environmental heating raising 𝑇sland tidal/ram-
pressure stripping lowering 𝐿X(removing gas content) during thesemergers/interactionswithlargerclustersleadtothesesigniﬁcantout-

Through visually examining the gas temperature and FoF group

ETGs that similarly had encounters with more massive FoF groups
but lie on the main sequence of the 𝐿X–𝑇slscaling relation. We ﬁnd
that three of these four ‘normal’ ETGs had very large 𝑀500mass
ratios (¡12) with their host halos and their gas temperatures only
increased03dex during these interactions. The remaining ‘nor-
mal’ETGinteractedwithamassiveclusterwith 𝑀50010137M

interactions with massive clusters ( 𝑀5001014M) in order to be
detectable as 𝐿X–𝑇slscaling relation outliers.
4.2 Gas temperature and density proﬁles
To elaborate on the scenario described above, we further show in
Fig.7themass-weightedtemperatureanddensityproﬁlesofgasfor
the three outlier ETGs at 𝑧=002051. In these proﬁles, we use

their temperature proﬁles are signiﬁcantly boosted. For ETG A, the
temperature proﬁle is almost ﬂat and everywhere hotter than before

This is a clear signature for the onset of external heating (Kim et al.

Thesegastemperatureanddensityproﬁlesfurthersupporttheen-

of them being signiﬁcant outliers in the 𝐿X–𝑇slscaling relation.
We argue that similar outliers seen in observed ETG X-ray scaling
relations are also backsplash objects that might have recently had
theirgasheatedupenvironmentally.Thisﬁndingcanalsopotentially

scaling relation. The three outlier ETGs we investigated all fell into
massiveclustersat 𝑧035andbecamebacksplashgalaxiesat 𝑧=0.
Thiscoincideswellwiththe 2dynamicaltimescalefordarkmatter

these environmentally heated ETGs to stand out as outliers on the

Inthispaper,wehaveexploredtheX-rayscalingrelationsofhotgas
in massive ETGs from IllustrisTNG-100. We derived mock X-ray
luminosities (using the public code MOCK-X) and spectroscopic-
like temperatures for a legacy mock-ETG sample from Wang et al.
(2020) that has well-studied total density proﬁles and dark matter
fractions. We compared the X-ray luminosity-mass relation and the
X-ray luminosity-temperature relation to observations for the sim-
ulated ETGs. We further studied how the low-mass end scatter in
the X-ray luminosity-mass scaling relation relates to the ETG dark
matter fraction, gas fraction, stellar population, and AGN feedback
activities. Our major ﬁndings are as follows:
(i) The𝐿X500–𝑀5𝑅escalingrelationhasaverysimilarslopeand
overall scatter to the observed Chandra ETGs. The scatter increases
at the low-mass end compared to the high-mass end. The 𝐿X500–
𝑇sl500scaling relation has slightly steeper slope than the observed
ChandraETGs,thoughhotgasinIllustrisTNGETGsareonaverage
05dex cooler than observations (Fig. 2).

similar to observations (Fig. 3 right), although IllustrisTNG ETGs
have systematically larger dark matter fractions than observations,
which was already known in earlier literature.
(iii) At the low-mass end ( log10¹𝑀5𝑅eMº6115) ETGs that
up-scatterin 𝐿X500(viceversathefollowingfordown-scatter)tend
to have higher gas fractions and younger stellar populations. This
is caused by their AGN having lower cumulative kinetic feedback
energy, which leads to their higher gas content and less eﬃcient
quenching. As a consequence, the younger stars could also provide
strongerstellarfeedbackheatingthatfurtherincreases 𝐿X.Thehigher
gasfractionintheendfuelsmoreactiverecentblackholeaccretion,
leading to these up-scatter ETGs having stronger recent ( 𝑧  01)
AGN kinetic feedback (Fig 4).
(iv) PastAGNfeedbackmediatesstarformationandstellarpopu-
lations in ETGs, thereby inﬂuencing the strength of stellar feedback
at present-day. This can partially explain why observations see a
sub-dominant role of AGN compared to stellar feedback with only
access to𝑧=0AGN properties and not their full accretion history
(Section 3.3).
(v) Thescatterof 𝐿X500doesnotcorrelatewiththetotaldensity

which dominate the ETG density proﬁle evolution at 𝑧.1, do not
signiﬁcantly impact 𝐿X500at ﬁxed𝑀5𝑅e(Figs. 3, 4).
WealsoinvestigatedthemergerhistoriesofthreeindividualETGs
(Fig. 2 black squares) that are outliers of the X-ray luminosity-
temperature scaling relation. We ﬁnd that:
(i) All three ETGs interacted with much larger galaxy
groups/clusterssince 𝑧04andwereenvironmentallyheated.Their
gastemperaturerisecoherentlywiththeirinfallintotheselargerFoF
groups,andthetemperaturepeakscoincidewellwithpericenterpas-
sageswiththoselargergalaxyclusters(Fig.6).Theirgastemperature
and density proﬁles also show clear signatures of external heating,
leaving those ETGs with very sparse and hot gas atypical of their
mass at𝑧=0(Fig. 7).
(ii) GiventhatthethreeoutlierETGsarebacksplashgalaxies,we
propose that querying outliers of the 𝐿X–𝑇slrelation can potentially
beusedasasearchstrategyforbacksplashETGsneargalaxyclusters.

As a ﬁnal note, AGN feedback impacting the scatter in the low-
mass-endofthe 𝐿X500–𝑀5𝑅erelationcanberegardedasatheoret-
ical prediction that could be veriﬁed in future observations correlat-
ing X-ray gas to the AGN of ETGs. New observations will provide
important constraints for developing more realistic AGN feedback
models in hydrodynamic simulations (e.g. more measurements for
the stellar ages of low-mass X-ray ETGs) and testing the picture we
have developed.. As for ﬁnding backsplash objects using outliers in
the𝐿X–𝑇slrelation, future X-ray missions can target the outskirts
of galaxy clusters for red galaxies (cross-correlating with optical
surveys) that simultaneously possess a hot X-ray component. Care

tothespeciﬁcinstrumentandthesuccessoftheproposedbacksplash
search campaign depends on the sensitivity to the contrast between
thebacksplashETGgasandtheextendhotgasfromthelargegalaxy

approach to ﬁnding backsplash galaxies in addition to the existing
density proﬁle-based (Adhikari et al. 2021) or surface-brightness-
ﬂuctuation-based (Casey et al. 2022) inference methods that could
yield fruitful outcomes in the near future.

APPENDIX B: BLACK HOLE MASS AND THERMAL AGN
FEEDBACK EFFECTS ON THE LUMINOSITY-MASS
SCALING RELATION
In this appendix we present the insigniﬁcant impact of SMBH
mass and radiative mode AGN feedback energy on the scatter of
the𝐿X500–𝑀5𝑅escaling relation at the low-mass end. In Fig. B1,
we show the 𝐿X500–𝑀5𝑅escaling relation colored by the SMBH
mass (𝑀BH, top panel), cumulative thermal AGN feedback energy
(Σ𝐸AGNThm, middle panel), and the recent AGN thermal feedback
energy from 𝑧=01to𝑧=0(𝛿𝐸AGNThm, bottom panel). In each
panel, we also include insets that further illustrate the correlation
between the colored physical quantities and Δ𝐿X500for low-mass
ETGswith log10¹𝑀5𝑅eMº6115.Throughthecolormapsinthe
mainscalingrelationslargePearson 𝑝valuesforthelinearﬁtsinthe
insetplots,weconcludethatnoneofthethreecoloredquantitiesshow
signiﬁcant correlation with the scatter in 𝐿Xat the low-mass end.
Thisindicatesthatthesystematicvariationinthe kineticmodeAGN
feedback energy seen in Fig. 4 is not due to systematic variations
in the SMBH mass, but rather intrinsic scatter in the accretion and
assembly histories of those SMBHs. The middle and bottom panels
ofFig.B1suggestthatthescatterin 𝐿X500atthelow-massendisnot
signiﬁcantly impacted by cumulative or recent radiative mode AGN
feedback,consistentwiththescenariothatradiativemodeAGNfeed-
back is subdominant compared to the kinetic mode in the SMBHs
of𝑧=0galaxies with 𝑀&1011Min IllustrisTNG (Zinger et al.
2020). Since radiative mode AGN feedback is mostly shut oﬀ for
most of these ETGs below 𝑧=01(bottom panel), it is unlikely to
be an eﬀective heat source that could alter 𝐿Xand aﬀect the scatter
in the scaling relation.
APPENDIX C: SPECTROSCOPIC-LIKE VERSUS
MASS-WEIGHTED TEMPERATURES
In Fig. C1 we show the temperature comparison between the
spectroscopic-like ( 𝑇sl500) deﬁnition and mass-weighted deﬁnition
(𝑇mw500). The deﬁnition of 𝑇sl500follows from Equation 1 and the
deﬁnition of ( 𝑇mw500) follows from Equation 2. The 𝑇 34weight-
ing for𝑇sl500makes the𝑇mw500of the simulated ETGs 02dex
higher than their 𝑇sl500.
