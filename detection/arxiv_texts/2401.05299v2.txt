Measurement of the total and differential
cross-sections of 𝒕¯𝒕𝑾production in 𝒑𝒑collisions at√𝒔=13TeV with the ATLAS detector
The ATLAS Collaboration
Measurements of inclusive and differential production cross-sections of a top-quark–top-
antiquark pair in association with a 𝑊boson (𝑡¯𝑡𝑊) are presented. They are performed by
targeting final states with two same-sign or three isolated leptons (electrons or muons) and
are based on√𝑠=13 TeVproton–proton collision data with an integrated luminosity of
140 fb−1, recorded from 2015to2018with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.
The inclusive 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊production cross-section is measured to be 880±80fb, compared to a
reference theoretical prediction of 745±50(scale)±13(2-loop approx.)±19(PDF,𝛼s)fb.

Two of the primary goals of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics programme are to look for signs of
newphysicsbeyondtheStandardModel(SM)andtodeterminethenatureofelectroweak(EWK)symmetry
breaking. Despitethorough scrutiny, no significantdeviation from theSM has been observed at the LHC.
ThisstronglymotivatesfurthertestingoftheSMbymeasuringrareprocessesmoreprecisely,examining
finalstateswhereonlyafewSMprocessescontribute,andprobingtheHiggsbosoninmoredetail. The
studyofassociatedproductionofatop–antitopquarkpairanda 𝑊boson,𝑡¯𝑡𝑊,isstronglyconnectedto
each of these goals. With one of the heaviest SM final states accessible at the LHC, and a correspondingly
small production cross-section, this process was first observed in Run 1 [1, 2] but a precise inclusive
measurement and the first differential measurements became possible only with the full Run 2 dataset.
Beyond the inherent interest in measuring such a rare process more precisely, better understanding of 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊
productionisalsoimportantbecauseitisakeybackgroundinmanysearchesandothermeasurementsatthe
LHC.ItisoneofthefewSMprocessesthatisanirreduciblesourceofsame-signdileptonpairs. Therarity
of these final states is exploited in many searches for new physics in extensions of the SM [3–5] where 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊
is a major background. Moreover, 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊production is the dominant background in many measurements
of other rare processes, such as 𝑡¯𝑡𝐻and𝑡¯𝑡𝑡¯𝑡production, that are important when probing the top-quark
Yukawa coupling and EWK symmetry breaking. The precision, accuracy and understanding of 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊
modelling is one of the main limitations on the sensitivity of these measurements.
Further motivation for precise measurements of 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊production comes from tensions between the data and
SM predictions observed in previous LHC measurements. Early measurements of 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊production by the
ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at√𝑠=8TeV [1, 2] were in agreement with the SM, but are less precise.
More recent direct measurements of 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊production at√𝑠=13TeV [6–9], and indirect measurements
of𝑡¯𝑡𝑊inanalysestargeting 𝑡¯𝑡𝐻[10]and𝑡¯𝑡𝑡¯𝑡[11,12]production,haveconsistentlyobserved 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊yields
larger than the SM predictions.
Although𝑡¯𝑡𝑊productionsuperficiallyappearstobeasimpleprocess,andonegovernedbywell-known
SM couplings, the quark–antiquark initial state at leading order (LO) in the strong coupling constant
leads to a rich array of phenomena. In particular, the process features charge-asymmetric production
(of𝑡¯𝑡𝑊+and𝑡¯𝑡𝑊−)fromthepartondistributionfunctionsandunusuallycomplexhigher-orderquantum
chromodynamics (QCD) and EWK corrections. One consequence of the complex EWK corrections is
theadditionalproductionmechanismsthattheyenable,suchas 𝑡𝑊-scattering[13]. Thisarisesthrough
EWK𝑡¯𝑡𝑊+jetproduction,whichhasembeddedwithinitaneffective 𝑡𝑊→𝑡𝑊vertexthatisinterestingto

context of effective field theory operators [14]. Figure 1 shows the dominant production modes for the 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊
process, including additional QCD and EWK corrections. Therefore, measurements of 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊production are
key in validating and improving the challenging theoretical predictions of this process, which has attracted
much recent interest from the theoretical community, as described in Section 3.
A theoretical prediction at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, including next-to-leading
order (NLO) EWK corrections, from Ref. [15] of 𝜎(𝑡¯𝑡𝑊)=745±50(scale)±13(2-loop approx.)±
19(PDF,𝛼s) fb, is used as a reference cross-section. It supersedes previous calculations, Ref. [16–28].
The different contributions to the total 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊cross-section are shown in Table 1. Considering only QCD
corrections, the predicted cross-section is 𝜎(𝑡¯𝑡𝑊)QCD=711+35
−46(scale)±14(2-loop approx.) fb, while
NLO EWK corrections give a total positive contribution of 4.9% [15]. Virtual EWK corrections are

This paper presents measurements of inclusive and differential cross-sections of 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊production at√𝑠=13TeV, including measurements of the 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊relative charge asymmetry. This is the first measurement
of differential cross-sections of 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊production at the LHC. The measurements are performed by analysing
final states with two same-sign electric-charge leptons ( 2ℓSS) and three leptons ( 3ℓ), whereℓdenotes
electrons or muons. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the ATLAS detector,

32 ATLAS detector
TheATLASdetector[29]attheLHCcoversnearlytheentiresolidanglearoundthecollisionpoint.1It
consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid, electromagnetic and
hadron calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting air-core toroidal
magnets.
The inner-detector system (ID) is immersed in a 2Taxial magnetic field and provides charged-particle
tracking in the range |𝜂|<2.5. The high-granularity silicon pixel detector covers the vertex region and
typically provides four measurements per track, the first hit normally being in the insertable B-layer
installed before Run 2 [30, 31]. It is followed by the silicon microstrip tracker, which usually provides
eight measurements per track. These silicon detectors are complemented by the transition radiation tracker
(TRT), which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to |𝜂|=2.0. The TRT also provides
electron identification information based on the fraction of hits (typically 30 in total) above a higher
energy-deposit threshold corresponding to transition radiation.
The calorimeter system covers the pseudorapidity range |𝜂|<4.9. Within the region |𝜂|<3.2,
electromagnetic calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr)
calorimeters,withanadditionalthinLArpresamplercovering |𝜂|<1.8tocorrectforenergylossinmaterial
upstream of the calorimeters. Hadron calorimetry is provided by the steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter,
segmentedintothree barrel structureswithin |𝜂|<1.7,andtwocopper/LArhadronendcapcalorimeters.
Thesolidanglecoverageiscompletedwithforwardcopper/LArandtungsten/LArcalorimetermodules
optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements respectively.
The muon spectrometer (MS) comprises separate trigger and high-precision tracking chambers measuring
thedeflectionofmuonsinamagneticfieldgeneratedbythesuperconductingair-coretoroidalmagnets.
Thefield integralof thetoroidsranges between 2.0and6.0Tmacrossmost ofthe detector. Threelayers
of precision chambers, each consisting of layers of monitored drift tubes, cover the region |𝜂|<2.7,
complemented by cathode-strip chambers in the forward region, where the background is highest. The
muontriggersystemcoverstherange |𝜂|<2.4withresistive-platechambersinthebarrel,andthin-gap
chambers in the endcap regions.
Interesting events are selected by the first-level trigger system implemented in custom hardware, followed
byselectionsmadebyalgorithmsimplementedinsoftwareinthehigh-leveltrigger[32]. Thefirst-level
trigger accepts events from the 40MHzbunch crossings at a rate below 100kHz, which the high-level
trigger reduces in order to record events to disk at about 1kHz.
An extensive softwaresuite [33]is used indata simulation, inthe reconstructionand analysis ofreal and
simulated data, in detector operations, and in the trigger and data acquisition systems of the experiment.
1ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the
detector and the 𝑧-axis along the beam pipe. The 𝑥-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the 𝑦-axis
points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (𝑟,𝜙)are used in the transverse plane, 𝜙being the azimuthal angle around the 𝑧-axis.
The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle 𝜃as𝜂=−ln tan(𝜃/2). Angular distance is measured in units of
Δ𝑅≡√︁
(Δ𝜂)2+(Δ𝜙)2.

atacentre-of-massenergyof√𝑠=13TeV.TheLHCconditionsrequiredtoachievehighinstantaneous
luminosity lead to additional collisions in the same and neighbouring proton bunch crossings (in-time and
out-of-timepile-up). Duringthedata-takingperiodconsidered,thenumberofcollisionsperbunchcrossing
ranged from about 8 to 70, with an average of 34. After the application of data-quality requirements [34],
the data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb−1.
Theoretical predictions of the 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊process with higher-order corrections in the QCD and EWK couplings
(𝛼sand𝛼) are very challenging. At LO in 𝛼sthere are complications because 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊is a𝑞¯𝑞-initiated
process. Theradiationofthe 𝑊bosonfromoneoftheinitial-statequarkspolarisestheincomingquark
in the associated 𝑡¯𝑡production, so it is important to correctly account for spin correlations [35]. Initial
calculationsof 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊productionatNLOinQCDatfixedorder[36]andlatermatchedtoapartonshower[37,
38] were also augmented with NLO EWK corrections (of order 𝛼2𝛼2
s) [39] to provide the higher-order
cross-sectionsusedacrosstheLHCprogrammeforanumberofyears[16]. FullNLOcalculationsincluding
fixed-order corrections matched to the parton shower (PS) in the Powheg Box framework and accounting
for LO spin-correlations of the decay products were provided in Ref. [24]. There has also been significant

have large NLO corrections, which require NLO-merged calculations for such effects to be included
properly[27]. Furthermore,beyondthetraditionally‘leading’NLOEWKcorrections(oforder 𝛼2𝛼2
s)there
are even larger contributions from traditionally ‘sub-leading’ NLO corrections (of order 𝛼3𝛼s) [13, 17, 24]
because of the presence of 𝑡𝑊scattering contributions embedded in the 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊𝑗process. Calculations at
NLO in QCD accounting for next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) effects are also available [18] and
soare recentpredictionsatNLO+NNLL inQCD,also withNLOEWK corrections [19,20]. The NNLL
correctionscanbeaslargeas7%oftheNLOQCDcross-section,dependingonthecalculationandthe

available, and more recently the NLO EWK corrections were incorporated [25] into these calculations,
alongwiththedevelopmentofprocedurestoapplytheoff-shellcorrectionstoNLO+PSsimulations[26].

SamplesofsimulatedeventswereproducedusingMonteCarlo(MC)techniquestomodelthedifferent
SM processes. In particular, the estimation of the 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊signal and several backgrounds is based upon these
simulations. Moredetailsoftheeventgenerationaregiveninthefollowingparagraphsandaresummarised
inTable2,withthesamplesinblack,orinparenthesesandingrey,indicatingthoseusedasthenominal
configurations, or to estimate the systematic uncertainties, respectively. Several data-driven corrections are
applied to the estimated backgrounds and detailed in Section 6.
After generating events for each sample’s process of interest, the detector response was modelled by either
afullsimulationoftheATLASdetectorbasedon Geant4[40,41]orafastsimulation( AtlFast 2 )relying
on parameterised showers in the calorimeter [42, 43]. The latter was only used for the modelling of some
rarebackgroundprocesses,suchas 𝑡𝐻𝑗𝑏and𝑊𝑡𝐻,andthemodellingofthe 𝑡¯𝑡𝑍and𝑡¯𝑡𝐻processeswith
5alternativegenerators(seeSection7). Additionalsimulated 𝑝𝑝collisions,generatedwith Pythia8.186[44]
using parameter values from the A3 tune [45], were overlaid to model the effects of both in-time and
out-of-timepile-up. Thepile-updistributionwasreweightedtoreflectthenumberofadditionalinteractions

described in Section 7.1.
Severalgeneratorswere studied forthe simulationof 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊production, and multiplesamples weregenerated
to model this process. The events in the nominal 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊sample were simulated using the Sherpa2.2.10 [46,
47]generatorwiththe NNPDF3.0nnlo PDFset[48]. Thematrixelement(ME)wascalculatedforupto
one additional parton at NLO and up to two partons at LO using Comix[49] and OpenLoops [50–52], and
mergedwiththe Sherpapartonshower[53]usingthe MEPS@NLO prescription[54]withamergingscale
of 30 GeV. The renormalisation and factorisation scales are chosen to be 𝜇r=𝜇f=𝐻T/2, where𝐻Tis
defined as the scalar sum of the transverse masses√︃
𝑝2
T+𝑚2of all final-state particles with transverse
momentum𝑝Tand invariant mass 𝑚. Top quarks were decayed at LO using the Sherpa particle decay
program to preserve spin correlations. In addition to this nominal prediction at NLO in the strong
coupling, higher-order corrections related to EWK contributions were also included in two ways. First,
event-by-event correction factors were applied; these provide virtual NLO EWK corrections of order 𝛼2𝛼2
s
derivedusingtheformalismdescribedinRef.[55]alongwithLOcorrectionsoforder 𝛼3,reducingthe
cross-section by 3.9% relative to NLO QCD. Both were implemented using the prescription described
in Refs. [46, 56]. Second, the real emission contributions of the sub-leading EWK corrections at order
𝛼3𝛼s[17] were accounted for via the addition of an independent Sherpa2.2.10 sample produced at LO in
QCD. The combination of contributions from NLO QCD and NLO EWK effects taken from this Sherpa
configuration closely follows the strategy described in Ref. [27] and results in a total cross-section of
𝜎(𝑡¯𝑡𝑊)=614.7fb.
Inthismeasurementof 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊productioncross-sections,thesignalprocessisdefinedtoincludethecombined
QCD and EWK corrections, as described for the nominal Sherpasample. The measured differential
cross-sections are compared with theoretical predictions obtained from various generators, including
the nominal Sherpaone. For one of the alternative predictions, the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.9.3
program [57] generated 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊events with up to one additional parton in the final state at NLO accuracy in
thestrongcoupling,usingthe NNPDF3.1nnlo [58]PDFset. Theshoweringandsubsequenthadronisation
was performed using Pythia8.245 with the A14 tune [59], and the NNPDF2.3lo [48] PDF set with
𝛼s=0.130. The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were performed by EvtGen1.6.0 [60]. The
differentjetmultiplicitiesweremergedusingtheFxFxNLOmatrix-elementandparton-showermerging
prescription [61] with a merging scale of 30 GeV. This prediction uses a different merging scale and differs
significantly from that in Ref. [27], which is also based on the FxFx prescription. The top quarks were
decayedatLOusingthe MadSpin [62,63]particledecayprogramtopreservespincorrelations. Several

6The production of 𝑡¯𝑡𝐻events was modelled using the Powheg Box v2 generator at NLO with the
NNPDF3.0nlo PDF set. The events were interfaced to Pythia8.230 using the A14 tune and the

to the leptonic contributions including off-shell 𝛾∗→ℓ+ℓ−contributions with a correction estimated
at one-loop level in 𝛼s. The resulting 𝑡¯𝑡ℓ+ℓ−cross-section, with 𝑚(ℓ+ℓ−)>1GeV, is162±21fb. A

generated using a LO ME and requiring 𝑚(ℓ+ℓ−)>1GeV. In this sample the photon can be radiated
from the top quark, the 𝑊boson, or the 𝑏-quark. The 𝑡¯𝑡𝑍/𝛾∗and𝑡¯𝑡→𝑊+𝑏𝑊−¯𝑏ℓ+ℓ−samples were
combined and together form the ‘ 𝑡¯𝑡𝑍/𝛾∗’ sample. The contribution from internal photon conversions

in the phase space they overlap, and was assigned a 50% normalisation uncertainty.
The production of 𝑡¯𝑡and single-top-quark events was modelled using the Powheg Box v2 [64–67, 71–
73] generatoratNLOwiththe NNPDF3.0nlo PDFset. Theeventswereinterfacedto Pythia8.230to

modelled with the ℎdampparameter set to 1.5 𝑚𝑡[74]. The production of a top quark in association with a
𝑊boson (𝑡𝑊) was modelled using the five-flavour scheme. The diagram removal scheme [75] was used to
remove interference and overlap with 𝑡¯𝑡production. Single-top 𝑠- and𝑡-channel production was modelled
using the Powheg Box v2 [72, 73] generator at NLO in QCD using the five- and four-flavour schemes,
respectively, and the corresponding NNPDF3.0nlo set of PDFs. The 𝑡¯𝑡sample was normalised to the

using Top++2.0 [76–82]. This cross-section is 𝜎(𝑡¯𝑡)NNLO+NNLL=832±51 pb. The single-top-quark
𝑡𝑊-channel inclusive cross-section was corrected to the theory prediction calculated at approximate
NNLO in QCD with NNLL soft-gluon corrections [83, 84]: 𝜎(𝑡,𝑡𝑊)aNNLO+NNLL=71.7±3.8pb. The

was used for diboson semileptonic decays at the same accuracy. The EWK 𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗(𝑉=𝑊,𝑍) process was
simulated for fully leptonic decays with one additional parton at LO using Sherpa2.2.2. Events of vector
boson production in association with additional jets, 𝑉+jets, were generated using Sherpa2.2.1 with two
additional partons at NLO and four additional partons at LO. The EWK 𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗(𝑉=𝑊,𝑍) process was
simulated for fully leptonic decays with one additional parton at LO using Sherpa2.2.2.
Rare background contributions ( 𝑡𝑍,𝑡¯𝑡𝑡¯𝑡,𝑡𝑡𝑊𝑊,𝑊𝑡𝑍, triboson,𝑡𝑡¯𝑡,𝑡𝐻𝑗𝑏and𝑊𝑡𝐻) were normalised
using their NLO theoretical cross-sections. The production of four top quarks, 𝑡¯𝑡𝑡¯𝑡, was normalised
to the theoretical prediction of 𝜎(𝑡¯𝑡𝑡¯𝑡)=13.37fb in Ref. [87], with an assumed 100% normalisation
uncertaintybasedonthelargercross-sectionmeasuredrecentlyforthisprocessbyATLAS[11]. A30%
uncertainty [88] was assumed for triboson production, while a 5% uncertainty was used for 𝑡𝑍production,
and all other rare backgrounds were assigned a 50% normalisation uncertainty.

Interactionverticesfromthe 𝑝𝑝collisionsarereconstructedfromatleasttwotrackswith 𝑝Tlargerthan

8one primary vertex candidate is found in the event, the candidate for which the associated tracks form the
largest sum of squared 𝑝Tis selected as the hard-scatter primary vertex [89].
Electron candidates are reconstructed from energy clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter matched
to a track in the ID [90]. They are required to satisfy 𝑝T>10GeV and|𝜂cluster|<2.47, excluding the
transition region between the endcap and barrel calorimeters ( 1.37<|𝜂cluster|<1.52). ‘Loose’ and ‘tight’
electron identification working points are used, based on a likelihood discriminant employing calorimeter,
tracking and combined variables that provide separation between electrons and jets.
Muon candidates are reconstructed by performing a combined fit of the track information from the ID
and MS [91]. The resulting muon candidates are re-fitted using the complete track information from both
detectorsystems. Theyarerequiredtosatisfy 𝑝T>10GeVand|𝜂|<2.5. ‘Loose’and‘medium’muon
identification working points are used.
Electron(muon)candidatesarematchedtotheprimaryvertexbyrequiringthatthesignificanceoftheir

Tofurthersuppressleptonsfromheavy-flavourhadrondecays,misidentifiedjets,orphotonconversions
(collectively referred to as ‘non-prompt leptons’), lepton candidates are also required to be isolated in
the tracker and in the calorimeter. The track-based lepton isolation criterion is based on the quantity

must satisfy 𝐼𝑅/𝑝ℓ

contributionsfrompile-upandtheenergydepositoftheleptonitself,isrequiredtobelessthan20%(30%)

These selection criteria largely suppress the contribution from non-prompt leptons. However, several
channelsconsideredinthismeasurementhaveadditionalsuppressionrequirementstargetingthemaintypes
of non-prompt leptons. Non-prompt leptons from hadron decays that contain bottom- or charm-quarks
(referred to as ‘heavy-flavour (HF) non-prompt leptons’) are further rejected using a boosted decision
tree(BDT)discriminant,referredtoasthenon-prompt-leptonBDT[92],basedonisolationandlifetime
informationaboutatrack-jetthatmatchestheselectedelectronormuon(referredtoasa‘lightlepton’).
Three workingpoints (WPs) based on thenon-prompt-lepton BDT are used: Tight,VeryTight , andTight–
not-VeryTight . TheTightWPallowspromptmuons(barrel/endcapelectrons)satisfyingthecalorimeter-
and track-based isolation criteria to be selected with an efficiency that is about 60% ( 60%/70%) for
𝑝T∼20GeVand reaches a plateau of 95% ( 95%/90%) for𝑝T∼40(40/65)GeV. The prompt-lepton
efficiency of the VeryTight WP for muons (barrel/endcap electrons) that satisfy the calorimeter- and
track-based isolation criteria is about 55% ( 55%/60%) for𝑝T∼20GeVand reaches a plateau of 90%
(85%/83%) for𝑝T∼40(40/65)GeV. The corresponding rejection factor5for muons (electrons) from
the decay of 𝑏-hadrons ranges from 33 to 50 (20 to 50) for the TightWP, and from 50 to 100 (33 to 66) for
theVeryTight WP, depending on 𝑝Tand𝜂, after resolving ambiguities between overlapping reconstructed

selection for control regions enriched in HF non-prompt-lepton background, as described in Section 6.
In order to further suppress electrons with incorrect charge assignment, a BDT discriminant based on
calorimeterandtrackingquantities[93]isused. Anefficiencyofapproximately96%inthebarrelregion
and 81% in the endcaps is obtained, with rejection factors of 19 in the barrel region and 40 in the endcaps.
The electron candidates are separated into three classes: ‘material conversion’, ‘internal conversion’, and
‘non-conversion’electroncandidates. Mostelectronsarisingfrommaterialconversions,i.e.fromphoton
conversions in the detector material, are rejected by the standard electron identification selection, but
additional requirements are imposed to remove residual material-conversion candidates. These candidates
have a reconstructed displaced vertex with radius 𝑟 > 20mm that includes the track associated with
the electron.6The invariant mass of the associated track and the closest (in Δ𝜂) opposite-charge track
reconstructed in the silicon detector, calculated at the conversion vertex, is required to be <100MeV.
Internal conversion candidates, which correspond to the internal photon conversions (see Section 3), must
fail the requirements for material conversions, and the di-track invariant mass, calculated here at the
primary vertex, is also required to be <100MeV.
The various lepton working points used in this analysis are summarised in Table 3. After the initial
categorisation based on ‘loose’ leptons (corresponding to 𝐿), the best lepton working point to further
optimise the event selection is chosen; it depends on the main background processes and available amount
ofdataineachcategory. ThevariouschoicesforthesignalandcontrolregionsaredescribedinSection5.
TheconstituentsforjetreconstructionareidentifiedbycombiningmeasurementsfromboththeIDand
the calorimeter using a particle flow (PFlow) algorithm [94]. Jet candidates are reconstructed from these
PFlow objects using the anti- 𝑘𝑡algorithm [95, 96] with a radius parameter of 𝑅=0.4. They are calibrated
usingsimulationwithcorrectionsobtainedbyusinginsitutechniquesindata[97]. Onlyjetcandidates
with𝑝T>25GeVand within|𝜂|<2.5are selected. In order to reduce the effect of pile-up, each jet with
𝑝T<60GeVand|𝜂|<2.4must satisfy the ‘Tight’ working point of the Jet Vertex Tagger (JVT) [98]
criteria used to identify jets that originate from the primary vertex. A set of quality criteria is also applied
to reject events containing at least one jet arising from non-collision sources or detector noise [99].
6The beampipe and insertable B-layer inner radii are 23.5 mm and 33 mm, respectively.

5 Analysis strategy
The events used in the analysis were selected with high efficiency using dilepton triggers [107, 108],
based on electron and muon signatures. The dielectron triggers required two electrons that satisfied loose
identificationcriteriawith 𝑝TthresholdsthatwereraisedastheluminosityincreasedduringRun2: 12 GeV
in 2015, 17 GeVin 2016, and 24 GeVin 2017–2018. Dimuon triggers utilised asymmetric 𝑝Tthresholds

triggerrequiredeventstohaveanelectroncandidatesatisfyinglooseidentificationwitha17 GeVthreshold
and a muon candidate passing a 14 GeV threshold for all data-taking periods.
Events selected by the trigger are required to satisfy basic preselection requirements. They must have
at least one primary vertex candidate. Events are required to contain either two light leptons with the

by the trigger and to have a 𝑝Texceeding the trigger 𝑝Tthreshold by 1 GeVor 2GeV(depending on
theleptontrigger,leptonmultiplicitycriteria,anddata-takingconditions). Thetriggerrequirementhas

or the𝑡¯𝑡𝑊signal, respectively, in those regions.
The signal regions are split into 2ℓSS and 3ℓcategories. The 3ℓevents are required to have the sum of
chargesofselectedleptons(totalleptoncharge)tobeexactly ±1. Eventsarerequiredtocontainatleast
one𝑏60%jet, or at least two 𝑏77%jets. If 3ℓevents contain pairs of opposite-sign charge and same-flavour
(OS-SF) leptons, all such pairs must satisfy requirements on the dilepton system mass of 𝑚SF
ℓ+ℓ−>12
GeVand|𝑚SF
ℓ+ℓ−−𝑚𝑍|>10GeV. Additionally, 3ℓevents must satisfy |𝑚3ℓ−𝑚𝑍|>10GeV. Leptons
are ordered in 𝑝Tin the 2ℓSS regions. In the 3ℓregions the lepton with opposite-sign charge is called
thefirstlepton,followedbythetwosame-signleptons. The 𝑝Tandidentificationrequirementsforeach
lepton in each category are optimised, accounting for the different likelihood of being non-prompt, and are
summarised in Table 4.
Events passing the 2ℓSS and 3ℓsignal region selections are separated into subcategories depending on
whether the inclusive or differential 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊cross-sections are being measured, as shown in Table 4. For the
𝑡¯𝑡𝑊differentialmeasurements,two 2ℓSSandsix 3ℓsignalcategories,basedonthetotalleptonchargeofthe
event and on the number of OS-SF lepton pairs in the 3ℓchannel, are defined in Section 8.2. The inclusive
𝑡¯𝑡𝑊measurement (see Section 8.1) is improved by assigning the preselected events to subcategories
based on the total lepton charge, the lepton flavour, and the jet and 𝑏-jet multiplicities ( 𝑁jetsand𝑁𝑏-jets,
respectively), where 𝑁𝑏-jetsis defined to be 2 or more if the events contain at least two 𝑏77%jets, or 1 if the

6 Background estimation
Thebackgroundprocessespassingthesignalregionselectionsarecategorisedintoirreducibleandreducible
backgrounds. Irreducible backgrounds (Section 6.1) have only prompt selected leptons, i.e. leptons
produced in𝑊/𝑍boson decays, leptonic 𝜏-lepton decays, or internal conversions. Reducible backgrounds
(Section 6.2) have prompt leptons with misassigned charge or at least one non-prompt lepton.
Allbackgroundswiththeexceptionofelectronswithmisassignedcharge(denotedbyQMisID)areestimated
using the simulated event samples described in Section 3. In some cases, the simulation is improved
by applying additional corrections derived from data control samples before the statistical analysis. In
particular, the event kinematics of the simulated 𝑡¯𝑡and𝑉𝑉backgrounds require dedicated corrections

6.1 Irreducible backgrounds
Background contributions with prompt leptons originate from a wide range of physics processes, with
the relative importance of individual processes varying by channel. The main irreducible backgrounds
originatefrom 𝑡¯𝑡𝑍/𝛾∗,𝑉𝑉(especially𝑊𝑍),and𝑡¯𝑡𝐻production,havingfinalstatesandkinematicproperties
inherently similar to the 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊signal. Smaller contributions originate from the following rare processes:
𝑡𝑍,𝑡𝑊,𝑡𝑊𝑍,𝑡¯𝑡𝑊𝑊,𝑉𝑉𝑉,𝑡¯𝑡𝑡¯𝑡, and𝑡¯𝑡𝑡production. Backgrounds with prompt leptons are estimated from
simulation using the samples described in Section 3.

according to whether they originate from HF or light-flavour (LF) hadron decays, or from a material
conversion candidate. The HF category includes leptons from bottom and charm decays. The LF category
is negligible in this analysis, and thus the non-prompt leptons from hadronic decays are dominated by HF
non-prompt leptons.
Two corrections are applied to the 𝑡¯𝑡and overall non-prompt-lepton background simulations before the fit.
First,the𝑡¯𝑡+≥1𝑏-jetcontributionismultipliedbyafactorof1.3aspreviouslymeasuredbyATLAS[109].
Second, the shape of the 𝑏-jet multiplicity distribution in the non-prompt-lepton background simulation is
correctedtomatchdatainanorthogonal 2ℓSSvalidationregionenrichedinnon-promptleptons,where
one of the leptons must pass a looser non-prompt-lepton BDT score but not pass the 𝑀lepton WP.
Several of the event categories introduced in Section 5 were designed to be enriched in specific processes
and are used to derive normalisation factors to improve the modelling in the simulation. The 3ℓMatC
CR is enriched in material conversions (denoted as “Mat Conv”) and only the total event yield is used.

2ℓtt(e)𝑀ex𝑇,2ℓtt(e)𝑀ex𝑀ex,2ℓtt(𝜇)𝑇𝑀 ex,2ℓtt(𝜇)𝑀ex𝑇, and 2ℓtt(𝜇)𝑀ex𝑀ex. In these CRs, the distribution
of the transverse momentum 𝑝ℓ1
Tof the sub-leading lepton is used. Requiring at least one 𝑀exlepton
in these CR events provides separation from the processes with prompt leptons, especially 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊, and
thus optimises the sensitivity to the HF non-prompt electron and muon contributions. The 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊signal
contribution in these control regions is at most 11% of the total expected yield. Normalisation factors for

respectively, which was achieved when using the exclusive 𝑀exlepton working point.
6.2.2 Charge misassignment
Backgrounds due to leptons with an incorrectly assigned charge primarily affect the 2ℓchannel and
arise mainly from 𝑡¯𝑡production, with one electron either undergoing hard bremsstrahlung followed by
an asymmetric conversion ( 𝑒±→𝑒±𝛾∗→𝑒±𝑒+𝑒−) or having mismeasured track curvature. The muon
charge misassignment rate is negligible in the 𝑝Trange relevant to this analysis. The electron charge
misassignment rate is measured in data by using samples of 𝑍→𝑒+𝑒−events reconstructed as either

7 Systematic uncertainties
Many sources of systematic uncertainty are considered for the cross-section measurements. These are
groupedintothreecategories: instrumentaluncertaintiesthataffectphysicsobjectreconstruction;modelling
uncertaintiesrelevantforMCsimulation-basedestimations;anduncertaintiesaffectingtheestimationof
misreconstructed-lepton backgrounds.
187.1 Instrumental uncertainties
Instrumentalsystematicuncertaintiesrelatedtothetriggerefficiency,leptonreconstructionandidentification,
jetcalibration, 𝑏-tagging,andnon-prompt-leptonBDTworkingpointcalibrationsareconsideredinthe
analysis. Physics object reconstruction and calibration are provided together with a systematic uncertainty
model for propagating the corresponding uncertainties to the analysis. The calibrations are applied either
as an overall event reweighting, or scale factor, to correct the simulation to the data, or as a rescaling
(smearing) of the object’s energy or momentum scale (resolution) and come with associated uncertainties.
The combined effect of these uncertainties is less than 10% in the inclusive measurement, but reaches
approximately 18% in the higher jet-multiplicity bins of the differential measurement.
Uncertainties associated with the lepton selection arise from the trigger, reconstruction, identification and
isolation efficiencies, and the lepton momentum scale and resolution [90, 91, 110, 111]. Uncertainties
in the non-prompt-lepton BDT calibration are estimated through a 𝑍→ℓℓtag-and-probe method and
coveruncertaintiesrelatedtothe 𝑍(→ℓℓ)+jetsMCmodelling,thetemplatecut/shape,the 𝑚ℓℓwindow,
the tag-and-probe lepton selections, the multĳet background, the non-prompt lepton background, the
luminosity, the cross-sections of the considered processes, and the limited number of events in simulation
anddata. Thecombinedeffectoftheseuncertaintiesisapproximately2%intheinclusivemeasurement
and typically less than 5% in the differential measurements.
Uncertainties associated with jet reconstruction and calibration arise from the jet energy scale (JES),
the JVT requirement and the jet energy resolution (JER). The JES and its uncertainties are derived by
combining information from test-beam data, collision data and simulation [97]. The JES and JER have 30
and13components,respectively,inthefit. TheuncertaintiesintheJES,JERandJVTincreaseatlower
jet𝑝T. Thecombinedeffectoftheseuncertaintiesisapproximately1.5%intheinclusivemeasurement,

inthesimulation. For 𝑏-jets,thecorrectionfactorsandtheiruncertaintiesareestimatedfromdatausing
dileptonic𝑡¯𝑡events [100, 102]. For 𝑐-jets, they are derived from jets arising from 𝑊boson decays in 𝑡¯𝑡
events[103]. Forlight-flavourjets,thecorrectionfactorsarederivedfromdĳetevents[104]. Uncertainties
from sources affecting the 𝑏- and𝑐-tagging efficiencies are evaluated as a function of jet 𝑝T, including
bin-to-bincorrelations. Theuncertaintiesintheefficiencyfortagginglight-flavourjetsdependonthejet 𝑝T
and|𝜂|. An additional uncertainty is assigned to account for the extrapolation of the 𝑏-tagging efficiency
measurement fromthe 𝑝Tregion usedto determinethecorrection factorsto regionswith higher 𝑝T. The
combined effect of these uncertainties is approximately 0.2% in the inclusive measurement, whereas in the
differentialmeasurements,itisapproximately3%intheintermediate 𝑏-jetmultiplicitybinsandrisesto
10%–18% for lower and higher 𝑏-jet multiplicities.
The uncertainty in the reweighting of the MC pile-up distribution to match the distribution in data is
evaluated by varying the reweighting factors and has a very small impact on either the inclusive or
differential results.
The uncertainty in the combined 2015–2018 integrated luminosity is 0.83% [112], obtained using the
LUCID-2 detector [113] for the primary luminosity measurements, complemented by measurements using
the inner detector and calorimeters.

analysis and leads to a combined impact (summing each contribution in quadrature) of 6% in the inclusive
measurement and, depending on the bin, 10%–20% in the differential measurement.
Theuncertaintyin 𝑡¯𝑡𝐻modellingduetotheinitial-stateradiation(ISR)isestimatedusingweightsinthe
matrix element calculation and the parton shower. The factorisation and renormalisation scales are varied,
and ISR𝛼svariations aretaken fromthe A14 tune. Additionally, uncertainties inthe ME (PSalgorithm –
partonshower,hadronisationandunderlying-eventmodelling)areestimatedbycomparingthenominal
Powheg+Pythia 8 MC simulation with MadGraph5+Pythia 8 (Powheg+Herwig 7).
Uncertainties due to missing higher orders in QCD are estimated for 𝑡¯𝑡𝑍production by varying the
nominal factorisation and renormalisation scales by factors of 0.5and2.0. Uncertainties in additional-jet
modellingareestimatedwithISR 𝛼svariationstakenfromtheA14tune. Partonshower, hadronisationand
underlying-event modelling uncertainties are estimated by comparing the nominal MadGraph5+Pythia 8
MC simulation with MadGraph5+Herwig 7.
Uncertainties in 𝑉𝑉modelling due to missing higher orders in QCD are estimated by varying the nominal
factorisation and renormalisation scales by factors of 0.5and2.0. In addition, systematic uncertainties
associatedwiththedata-driven 𝑁jets-dependentcorrectionfactorsappliedto 𝑉𝑉productionarederived
from the fit function parameter uncertainties.
Alternative𝑡¯𝑡MCsamplesareusedforshoweruncertaintiesintheHFnon-prompt-leptonbackgroundestim-
ate and for uncertainties in the extrapolation from the CRs to the SRs. For this, the Powheg+Herwig 7.1.3
andSherpa2.2.10 samples are used.
Theuncertaintiesinhigher-ordercross-sectionsaretakenintoaccountbyusingthevaluesgiveninSection3
for all background processes except those whose normalisation is measured in the fit. In the 𝑡¯𝑡𝑍MC
sample, the component containing additional heavy-quark-initiated jets is normalised to the theoretical
prediction and assigned a 50% uncertainty.
7.3 Non-prompt-lepton background modelling uncertainties
For the estimation of non-prompt-lepton backgrounds from HF decays and conversions, the following
uncertainties are taken into account.
Uncertaintiesareestimatedforthemodellingofthenon-prompt-leptonBDTinputvariables,namelythe
muon’s energy deposit in the calorimeter relative to the expected value ( 𝐸cluster/𝐸expected), the electron
track𝑝Tdivided by the jet track 𝑝T, and the secondary vertex’s longitudinal significance, using tracks with
𝑝T>500MeVfornon-promptmuons. Theseuncertaintiesareincludedasvariationsthatcanaffectthe
shape of distributions in each region, but not their normalisation.
20Extrapolationuncertaintiesinthenon-prompt-leptonbackgroundyieldsarederivedtoaccountfornon-
prompt-leptonratedifferences betweenthe Tight–not-VeryTight andVeryTight non-prompt-leptonBDT
workingpoints. Theseuncertaintiesareobtainedbycomparingthenon-prompt-leptonefficienciesinthe
nominal𝑡¯𝑡simulationwiththoseinanalternative 𝑡¯𝑡simulationasafunctionoflepton 𝑝Tandseparately
for electrons and muons. A constant uncertainty of 20% is estimated for electrons and muons.
Uncertainties in the 𝑡¯𝑡parton shower are assessed by using the Powheg+Herwig 7𝑡¯𝑡MC simulation as a
variation of the nominal Powheg+Pythia 8 prediction, separately for the electron and muon channels.
Uncertainties in the modelling of 𝑡¯𝑡production in association with heavy-flavour jets are accounted for by
assigning an uncorrelated 50% uncertainty to the 𝑡¯𝑡+𝑏and𝑡¯𝑡+𝑐background processes.
Uncertainties in the electron conversion background extrapolation from 𝑍-enriched to 𝑡¯𝑡-enriched regions
arederivedfromtheresidualdata/simulationmismodellingindedicated 2ℓvalidationregionswithtwotight
same-signleptons,requiringoneofthemtobeaconversioncandidate. Internalandmaterialconversion
extrapolation uncertainties of 50% and 10%, respectively, are applied.
A systematic uncertainty of 10%–60% is assigned to the background from electrons with misidentified
charge. The uncertainty increases with electron 𝑝Tand decreases with |𝜂|. The uncertainty is assessed
bycombiningtheuncertaintiesinthemeasurementofthechargemisassignmentrate,thechangesinthe
rate when varying the 𝑚𝑍window selection, and the different rates measured in data and 𝑍→𝑒+𝑒−
simulation.
8 Results
A maximum-likelihood fit to all bins in the SRs and the 10 CRs (see Tables 4 and 5) is performed to
simultaneously determine the background and the 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊signal yields that are most consistent with the data.
In the six HF non-prompt electron and muon CRs ( 2ℓtt(e)𝑇𝑀 ex,2ℓtt(e)𝑀ex𝑇,2ℓtt(e)𝑀ex𝑀ex,2ℓtt(𝜇)𝑇𝑀 ex,
2ℓtt(𝜇)𝑀ex𝑇,2ℓtt(𝜇)𝑀ex𝑀ex), the sub-leading lepton’s transverse momentum ( 𝑝ℓ1
T) distribution is used,
whereas in the two conversion CRs ( 3ℓIntC, 3ℓMatC) and the 3ℓVV CR, the total event yield (i.e. a single
bin) is used. In the 3ℓttZ CR, the𝑏-jet multiplicity is fitted.

the SRs and CRs are shown in Tables 7, 8, and 9. There are no significant deviations from the predictions
after the fit to data.

is compatible with the measurement from CMS.
Additional measurements are performed using the same analysis model, butmeasuringthe cross-sections
of𝜎(𝑡¯𝑡𝑊+)and𝜎(𝑡¯𝑡𝑊−)simultaneously. Splitting the measurement by 𝑊boson charge is interesting
because a strong charge asymmetry is expected due to the associated asymmetry in the valence quark PDF,
andthisfeatureisoftenusedtoseparate 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊productionfromotherprocesseswithsimilarfinalstates,such
as𝑡¯𝑡𝐻and𝑡¯𝑡𝑡¯𝑡production. The following values were measured:

298.2 Differential cross-section measurement
The differential 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊measurements were made as a function of six different observables. The chosen
observables were selected because they have either an experimental motivation (e.g. variables where
modelling discrepancies were observed before) or a theoretical motivation (e.g. variables that have
significantdistributionshapechangesduetoNLOcorrections). Thefullsetofmeasuredobservablesis
given in Table 11.

Aprofilelikelihoodunfoldingprocedure[116](PLU)isusedtomeasureparticle-leveldifferentialcross-
sections forone observableat a timein thefiducial phasespace defined inSection 5. A likelihoodmodel
is built for a detector-level distribution by treating the contribution from each generator-level bin as a
subcomponent of the detector-level signal. The likelihood takes the following form:

where𝑃and𝐺areprobabilitydensityfunctionsofthePoissonandGaussiandistributions,respectively.

®𝜆, the ratios of the measured background yields to the predicted values, and ®𝜃, the systematic-uncertainty

Systematic uncertainties, evaluated at detector level, impact the unfolded cross-section measurements
through modifications of the response matrix.
The binning scheme is optimised for each observable, except 𝑁jets, so that at least 60%of the total number
of events in a given particle-level bin are in the diagonal element of the migration matrix and there is
low statistical uncertainty for the yields in a given reconstruction-level bin (i.e. taking into account the
signalandbackgroundMCsamples). Thestatisticaluncertaintyisrequiredtobebelow10%(16%)for
high-purity (low-purity) regions to obtain similar bin granularity.

32factorstobeclosetozero. Theregularisationstrengths, 𝜏𝑗,arefixedparametersthatassumeacommon
value across bins in each signal region and observable. The chosen 𝜏𝑗values are optimised independently
for each signal region and observable. The optimisation procedure is based on statistical bootstrapping
toestimatethevalueof 𝜏thatminimisestheglobalcorrelationcoefficient 𝜌oftheunfoldedcovariance
matrix [121]. It is given by the following expression:
𝜌=√︃

𝑖∈1,...,𝑁 bins,
where𝑉𝑖𝑗is the covariance matrix of the bin normalisation factors. Pseudo-experiments are sampled from
detector-leveltemplatesobtainedfromthebackgroundpredictionsandalternative 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊sample. Another
optimisation procedure is studied, which selects the maximum value of 𝜏that does not increase the 𝜒2
between the unfolded observable’s distribution and the alternative 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊generator-level template. The 𝜒2is
defined as:
𝜒2=𝑛∑︁

whereΔ𝜎𝑖is the difference between the unfolded data and the MC prediction and 𝐶−1
𝑖,𝑗is the inverse of the
covariance matrixofthe unfolded crosssections. The 𝜒2-basedprocedure yieldslargervalues for 𝜏than
the𝜌-basedprocedure. The 𝜌-basedprocedureisultimatelychosenbecauseitisnotsensitivetothechoice
of alternative 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊generator-level template, while the 𝜒2-based procedure willgivea large bias when the
shape of the observed data distribution differs from the nominal 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊prediction more than the alternative
𝑡¯𝑡𝑊prediction does.
Various closure and stress tests of the unfolding procedure are performed. Full closure is achieved in
fits to an Asimov [122] dataset.9Additional validation tests are performed, for example by changing
normalisations in certain regions or applying linear slopes in the particle-level distributions. In both cases,
perfect retrieval of the injected particle-level distribution is observed, as expected from the PLU technique
and the chosen regularisation technique. A stress test evaluating the bias in the unfolding procedure is
performedbyunfoldinganAsimovdatasetobtainedusinganalternativesignalmodel. Asimilarstress
test evaluating the sensitivity of the unfolding procedure to the limited number of simulated events is
performed by splitting the nominal signal sample into two parts of equal size, where one part is used
for the unfolding and the other is used to generate the Asimov dataset. Good closure is obtained in all
cases. A comprehensive stress test is performed to characterise the level of bias as a function of 𝜏by

the different lepton-charge regions differs between the two cases, the underlying data are the same.
The results are shown in Figures 11–16. The measurements are compared with the theoretical predictions
previously described in Section 3. Only the results in the 3ℓchannel are compared with a dedicated
theoretical prediction based on the procedure outlined in Ref. [23] that includes off-shell effects. This
predictioniscalculatedatpartonlevelandcorrectedtoparticlelevelbyapplyingbin-by-binscalingfactors
that account for non-perturbative effects, such as multiparton interactions and hadronisation.
The compatibility of the measured differential cross-section distributions and the predictions is assessed by
calculating𝜒2values and probabilities, for the relevant number of degrees of freedom, properly taking
into account uncertainty correlations. These values are shown in Tables 13 and 14 for the normalised
cross-sections in the 2ℓSS and 3ℓregions respectively. They are shown for the normalised cross-sections
rather than the absolute cross-sections in order to give a better indication of how well the theoretical
predictions agree with the data, without having to take account of the known difference between the
predictedandmeasuredinclusiveabsolutecross-sections. The 𝜒2𝑝-valuesforcompatibilityoftheabsolute
cross-sectionmeasurementsandthe Sherpapredictionsareintherangeof6%–70%,andtypicallyless

and at low and high jet multiplicities in the 2ℓSS channel. The dominant systematic uncertainty stems
from the𝑡¯𝑡𝑊model and is due to the difference between the unfolded results from different choices of
𝑡¯𝑡𝑊referencesample. Atlargejet multiplicitiesthetheoreticaluncertainty ofthebackgroundmodel and
non-prompt-leptonBDTarethelargest. Thetotaluncertaintyinthenormalisedcross-sectionmeasurements
is somewhat reduced; a major contribution to this is the smaller 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊model uncertainty after removing
normalisation effects. The 𝐴rel
Cmeasurement uncertainty is dominated by the statistical uncertainty across
the range of jet multiplicities because many systematic uncertainties cancel each other out in the ratio. The
absolutecross-sectionmeasuredindataishigherthanallthetheoreticalpredictions,thelargestdiscrepancy
beingatlowjetmultiplicitiesinthe 2ℓSSchannel. Athighmultiplicitiesthepredictionswithadditional
partons using NLO merging are in better agreement with the data than the NLO+PS prediction from
Powheg,asexpected,forboththe 2ℓSSand 3ℓchannels. Takingthescaleuncertaintiesintoaccount,these
are compatible with the data for jet multiplicities greater than four. Uncertainties due to the scales are
approximately 10% for low jet multiplicities and increase to about 40% for higher multiplicities. The
main𝑡¯𝑡𝑊contribution to the 2ℓSS selection is the final state with two leptonically decaying 𝑊bosons,
one from the decay of a top quark and one from the associated 𝑊boson. This gives rise to a final state
with four partons from the hadronic decay of the remaining 𝑊boson and the 𝑏-quarks from the top quark
decays. Therefore, the disagreement between theory and data at lower jet multiplicities is independent
of the modelling of additional partons and is observed for both the NLO+PS generators and those with
additionalpartonsusingNLOmerging. Theshapeofthe 𝐴rel

37amount of data is the largest source of uncertainty across most bins of the measurement. The main
systematic uncertainties come from the modelling of the 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊signal process, with an important additional
contribution from the jet energy scale and resolution, particularly in the low 𝐻jet
Tregion. The absolute
cross-section measurements indicate a slight improvement in modelling at high 𝐻jet
Tfrom the predictions
with additional partons using NLO merging, similarly to what was seen for 𝑁jets. The normalised
cross-sectionmeasurements,showninthemiddlepanelofFigure12(a),showthatthemodellingofthe
distribution’s shape is generally very good in the 2ℓSS channel, while the predictions favour lower values
than the data in the 3ℓchannel. The 𝐴rel
Cdistribution predictions are also in agreement with data in the
2ℓSS region, but not in the 3ℓregion. This seems to be driven by a significant difference between data and
predictions in the 3ℓ+region, as shown in Figure 12(c).

Cas a function of

T. ThecorrespondinguncertaintiesareshowninFigure13(b). Thedominantsystematicuncertainty
across the𝐻lep
Trange comes from the 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊model, with additional contributions from the background
normalisation and lepton charge misidentification and non-prompt-lepton BDT at lower 𝐻lep
Tvalues.

the predictions with additional partons using NLO merging and therefore has overall better agreement
with the data. The ‘off-shell’ 𝑝-value for the absolute cross-section distribution is 0.85 compared to a
value of 0.61 for the Powheg+Pythia 8 prediction. All predictions are generally in good agreement

decrease in the systematic uncertainty is observed, especially at intermediate values of 𝐻lep
T, for the
normalised cross-section measurement shown in Figure 13(b). This is due to the large decrease in several
key uncertainties, including uncertainties in the 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊model and background normalisation and theoretical
uncertaintiesinthebackgroundmodelling. Thevaluesof 𝐴rel

measurement across the range of Δ𝑅ℓ𝑏,leadvalues, as shown in Figure 14(b). A mild discrepancy between
data and predictions is observed at low Δ𝑅ℓ𝑏,leadfor𝐴rel
Cin the 2ℓSS channel. This is because at low
Δ𝑅ℓ𝑏,leadvalues in the 2ℓSS−−channel the cross-sections measured in data are lower than the predictions,
as shown in Figure 14(c), yielding the different 𝐴rel
Cvalues.
Figure 15(a) shows the measured absolute cross-section, normalised cross-section and 𝐴rel
Cas a function of
|Δ𝜙ℓℓ,SS|. The normalised cross-section measurements show generally good agreement between data and
the predictions in the overall shape of the distributions. However, there is some deviation between the data
and the predictions for 𝐴rel
C, which is expected to have a constant value across |Δ𝜙ℓℓ,SS|. The cross-section

the2ℓSS−−channel the cross-section observed in data is larger than the predictions at intermediate values
of|Δ𝜙ℓℓ,SS|. This can be seen in Figure 15(c) and is reflected in the 𝜒2𝑝-value of 0.41 with respect to the
Sherpaprediction in Table 15.

shown in Figure 16(c). However, these trends are not statistically significant.
In summary, all absolute cross-section measurements show a significant normalisation effect, as expected
from the larger-than-predicted result of the inclusive cross-section measurement. Additionally, some
observables show mild tension between data and prediction in parts of the normalised cross-section
distributions. However, the observed 𝜒2𝑝-value for any single distribution does not indicate a significant
disagreement between the data and theoretical predictions at the current accuracy of the measurements.
9 Conclusion
Measurements of both the inclusive and differential cross-sections for producing a top-quark–antiquark
pair in association with a 𝑊boson (𝑡¯𝑡𝑊) are presented. The measurements are based on√𝑠=13 TeV
proton–proton collision data with an integrated luminosity of 140 fb−1, recorded from 2015to2018
with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The signal regions are split into final states
with two same-sign or three isolated leptons (electrons or muons), and are further split according to
their total lepton charge. Additional background-enriched regions are used in the fit to improve the
modelling of several leading backgrounds. The inclusive 𝑡¯𝑡𝑊production cross-section is found to be
880±80fb, which is consistent with the previous measurement from CMS and other analyses probing
similar𝑡¯𝑡𝑊-enriched regions. Improved theoretical calculations have led to increases in the predicted
cross-section through the corrections for missing higher-order QCD and EWK effects. Some tension
between the predictions and the data remains. The measurement and the SM NNLO theoretical prediction
of745±50(scale)±13(2-loop approx.)±19(PDF,𝛼s)fbarecompatible atthelevelof 1.4𝜎. Theratio
ofcross-sectionsfromdifferentchargesoftheassociated 𝑊bosonismeasuredtobe 𝑅(𝑡¯𝑡𝑊)=1.96±0.22
and the relative charge asymmetry is measured to be 𝐴rel
C=0.33±0.05, both are dominated by statistical
uncertainties, but agree with theoretical predictions.
Differential absolute and normalised cross-section measurements are performed for several particle-level
observables. The compatibility between data and predictions for the overall normalisation of the absolute
cross-section measurements is consistent with the inclusive measurement result. The latest off-shell
fixed-order predictions do not address this observed tension, concluding that the latter does not originate
from the additional single-resonant and non-resonant contributions that this calculation includes on top of
the double-resonant contribution contained in the predictions matched to parton showers.
