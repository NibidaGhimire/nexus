Using numerically exact diagonalization, we study the correlated Haldane-Hubbard model in the
presence of dissipation. Such dissipation can be modeled at short times by the dynamics governed
by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, of which we present a full characterization. If the
dissipation corresponds to a two-body loss, the repulsive interaction of the effective Hamiltonian
acquires an imaginary component. A competition between the formation of a charge-ordered Mott
insulator state and a topological insulator ensues, but with the non-Hermitian contribution aiding in
stabilizing the topologically non-trivial regime, delaying the onset of the formation of a local order
parameter. Lastly, we analyze the robustness of the ordered phase by following the full dissipative
many-body real-time dynamics. An exponentially fast melting of the charge order occurs, whose
characteristic rate is roughly independent of the interaction strength, for the case of one-body
dissipation.
I. INTRODUCTION
Topological states of quantum systems embody a fun-
damental departure from the standard classification of
spontaneously symmetry-broken phases based on the
Landau paradigm of the emergence of a local order pa-
rameter. Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, in turn, also de-
pict a branch off from the standard characterization of
certain physical systems [1], particularly isolated ones,
and are significant in describing various processes in
nature that involve non-conservation of either energy
or particles, including non-equilibrium regimes of open
quantum systems [2], optical and photonic systems [3–
10], mechanical systems [11–13], and electric circuits [14–
18].
A surge of research activity has recently been put
forward by mixing these two themes [19–21], includ-
ing non-Hermitian versions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model [22–25], models for Chern insulators [26–28], and
also models for quantum spin Hall insulators [29, 30]. An-
other fundamental model that encompasses topology is
the honeycomb Haldane model [31], which, by a suitable
breaking of time-reversal symmetry, has an associated
chiral edge mode mapped by a bulk topological invariant,
the Chern number [32], defining a bulk-boundary corre-
spondence. Its extensions to non-hermiticity exist [33],
including in modified lattice geometries [34]. While the
standard bulk-boundary correspondence is typically vio-
lated under such conditions [28, 35, 36], it can be recov-
ered with appropriate modifications [37–39].
Focusing on Hermitian scenarios, the Haldane model
has been generalized to study the effects of various types
of interactions [40–42], which can lead to spontaneous
symmetry breaking of the SU(2)-symmetry [43–45], or
even the emergence of topological characteristics with the
increase of interactions for certain electronic fillings [46].

†rmondaini@csrc.ac.cnWithin this correlated setting, the disorder inclusion may
lead to a regime of topological Anderson insulator [47],
while hopping dimerization can result in higher-order
topology [48]. Moreover, schemes to drive the real-time
dynamics to access target states exhibiting non-trivial
topology over fine-tuned time-dependent perturbations
have also been developed [49].
In this paper, we expand the scope of investigations
of this paradigmatic model and address the question of
the stability of correlated topological phases under dis-
sipative effects, which can be modeled at short times by
a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We do so by consider-
ing either one or two-body dissipation types, which can
be fundamentally relevant for understanding the results
of the simulations using cold atoms [50], where dissipa-
tive effects often need to be considered [51–55]. Further-
more, this investigation expands the scope of studies of
the interplay between topology and interactions in non-
Hermitian settings [14, 23, 56–82] for the first time in the
case of the honeycomb Haldane model.

iˆciis the corresponding
number operator. t1gives the magnitude of the nearest-
neighbor ( ⟨i, j⟩) hopping terms, whereas t2is the mag-
nitude of next-nearest neighbor ones ( ⟨⟨i, j⟩⟩). The lat-
ter further acquires a phase eiϕijwith ϕij= +ϕ(−ϕ)
for counter-clockwise (clockwise) hoppings [see Fig.1(a)].arXiv:2305.18762v2  [cond-mat.str-el]  27 Aug 20232
Lastly, a staggered potential assigns different onsite en-
ergies ±Mfor the two sublattices that compose the hon-
eycomb lattice. The noninteracting ( V= 0) ground state
of Eq. 1 exhibits topological characteristics provided that
M < 3√
3t2sinϕ, associated with protected chiral edge
modes, mapped by the existence of a topological invari-
ant, the Chern number C, related to a physical quantity,
the Hall conductivity ( σxy=e2
hC) [31, 32]. Introduc-
ing interactions, existing studies have shown that a first-
order transition from a topological insulator (TI) to a
charge-density wave (CDW) insulator occurs for a crit-
ical value of the interactions V[83–85]. We aim to un-
derstand the nature of this transition under the consid-
eration that the system can be subjected to losses to an
environment (bath), which naturally occurs in cold atom
experiments via either atom losses or inelastic scatter-
ing among them. Under these conditions, the system’s
density matrix ˆ ρcan be described by a quantum master
equation,
∂tˆρ(t) =−ih
ˆH,ˆρ(t)i

where ˆL(ˆρ), the Liouvillian superoperator, represents the
influence of the bath on the system. Concretely, it reads

where γ >0 describes the loss rate to the environment,

the quantum jump term such that the density matrix

This effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian characterizes
the initial dynamics via the analysis of its properties; for
example, being non-Hermitian entails that its eigenvalues
are generally complex, and the imaginary part governs
the corresponding eigenstate lifetime. A single-particle
loss to the environment is emulated by ˆLm= ˆcm, whereas
a two-particle inelastic scattering via ˆLmm′= ˆcmˆcm′. In
the first case, ˆH(1)

is the total number operator. This second term is a con-
stant due to the particle number conservation and, as
a result, does not modify the physical properties of ˆH,
including the location of the topological phase transi-
tion. Consequently, the single-particle loss is only rel-
evant when the quantum jump term is not neglected in
the dynamics.The two-body loss, on the other hand, leads to an effec-
tive non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with the same functional
form of the original model, but with interactions acquir-
ing an imaginary component: V→V−iγ2/2 [ˆH(2)

⟨i,j⟩ˆniˆnj]. Similar analysis has been performed
for one-dimensional bosonic [14, 64] or fermionic [63]
models exhibiting topological behavior. In what follows,
we characterize the low-lying spectrum of ˆH(2)
eff, where we
define the ground state as the one that has the smallest
real part. For that, we employ a Krylov-Schur-based di-
agonalization method [86, 87] to extract the eigenpairs
Eα,|αR⟩, as well as the corresponding left eigenvectors
|αL⟩, satisfying ˆHeff|αR⟩=Eα|αR⟩[ˆH†
eff|αL⟩=E∗
α|αL⟩].
Calculations are mainly performed in the highly sym-
metric Ns= 24-site cluster [Fig. 1(a)] in the presence
of periodic boundary conditions (PBC) at half-filling.
Such geometry satisfies two important criteria: It pre-
serves all point-group symmetries of the thermodynamic
limit and possesses the Brillouin zone corner Kas a valid
momentum point, which allows capturing the concomi-
tant occurrence of a topological-to-trivial transition and
the quantum phase transition associated with the emer-
gence of charge ordering in this model [83, 85]. With
PBCs, one can block-diagonalize ˆHeffin momentum sec-
tors since the added non-Hermitian terms do not break
the translation invariance present in the original Hamil-
tonian (1). We note that for all parameters we investi-
gate, the ground state still resides in the zero-momentum
sector with γ1, γ2̸= 0, and our characterization is con-
strained to it. Lastly, we take t1= 1 as the energy unit
and focus the calculations at t2= 0.2 and ϕ=π/2 in
the absence of staggered potentials ( M= 0). This last
choice naturally increases the robustness of the topologi-
cal phase upon the inclusion of interaction since it avoids
facilitating the creation of a trivial charge density-wave
pattern that would spontaneously emerge at sufficiently
large V’s in the thermodynamic limit. Taking ϕ=π/2
also makes the topological phase more robust to the in-
teractions [83].
III. RESULTS
We start by describing the formation of charge order
in the system governed by the real interactions V, as-
sociated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking of in-
version symmetry. This is done by computing the (zero-
momentum, k= 0) expectation values of the CDW struc-
ture factor,

where ˆ nA,B
iare the number operators in sublattices A
andBof the i-th unit cell. Here, we notice the ambigu-
ity in computing expectation values, where one can use
either a, b=L, R eigenstates. In doing so, we ensure that3
a⟨ˆO⟩b≡⟨αa|ˆO|αb⟩
⟨αa|αb⟩is correctly normalized. We focus on
the right eigenstates in the main text, i.e., a, b=R, but
Appendix A shows the different possibilities, which give
compatible results.
The results for Scdwin the space of parameters ( V, γ2)
shown in Fig. 1(b3) highlight that the critical point at
which the charge ordering rapidly grows is pushed to-
ward larger interaction strengths Vconce the two-body
dissipation is introduced ( γ2>0). An interpretation
is that charge ordering, resulting in a Mott-insulating
ground state, is significantly hampered by the loss as-
sociated with the interactions; consequently, one would
need a larger real Vto counterbalance it. Such behavior
is also followed by the excitation gap ∆ = E1−E0, whose
real and imaginary parts are displayed in Fig. 1(b1)
and 1(b2), respectively. Within the CDW regime, both
∆imag≡Im(E1−E0) and ∆ real≡Re(E1−E0) are sub-
stantially reduced in comparison to the regime without
charge ordering. In the former, the two lowest states in
the spectrum form a doublet which are CDW-like states
exhibiting even or odd parity under the inversion symme-
try and are typically far from the bulk of the spectrum.
A final characterization of the ground state is made by
considering its topological properties. Here, the Chern

with a, b=L, R is computed by obtaining the many-
particle ground-state |ψa,b⟩under a set of twisted bound-
ary conditions (TBCs) {ϕx, ϕy}, being quantized for any
system size. In principle, this leads to a set of four dif-
ferent Chern numbers, CLL, CLR, CRL, CRR, but it has
been recently proven that they are all equivalent [88], in-
cluding in many-body settings [64]. We choose C≡CRR
for convenience. Besides that, provided that the exci-
tation gap is finite for all twisted boundary conditions
when adiabatically changing a control parameter in the
Hamiltonian ( γ2orVin our case), the topological num-
ber remains invariant. Such gap opening condition [89]
is a necessary ingredient for a quantized Chern number,
and Eq. (7) can be further computed over a coarsely dis-
cretized Brillouin zone defined by the TBCs [42, 85]. Here
we use a number Nϕx,ϕy= 9 of boundary conditions for
each direction.
The corresponding Chern number phase diagram is dis-
played in Fig. 1(b4). It shows to directly extend the
results of the Hermitian case [83, 85] in that the topo-
logical insulator (TI) survives only in the regime of small
interactions and is further benefited from the suppres-
sion of the charge ordering by the dissipation rate γ2.
It thus corroborates that, at half-filling, this model does
not support a topological Mott insulator, now extending
such results to the non-Hermitian frame.
Nonetheless, we note that within the CDW insulator
phase, the Chern number can exhibit non-quantized val-
ues. A quick comparison to the phase diagram for thegap for excitations [Fig. 1(b1)] suggests that a gap clos-
ing for the real part of ∆ is likely tied to such behav-
ior, where branches with vanishing ∆ realappear at close
constant values of γ2. To understand this better, we re-
port in Fig. 2(a)–2(c) the low-lying spectrum for period-
ical boundary conditions ( {ϕx, ϕy}= 0) at a fixed inter-
action strength ( V= 2.36), near one of such branches
(γ2= 2.80−2.84). The previously mentioned CDW dou-
blet exhibits a level “crossing” in that the real part of
the gap vanishes while the imaginary part remains fi-
nite. That is sufficient to render a non-quantized Chern
number. We also note that in Fig. 1(b2), the imaginary
part of the gap displays branches in the CDW phase with
small values, but these remain finite.
The TI-CDW transition, on the other hand, is charac-
terized by a crossing of the doublet with the original state
displaying a finite Chern number, see Figs. 2(d)–2(f), for
a finite γ2= 2. As a result, ∆ real→0 at V→Vc,
but the imaginary part, initially positive, turns negative
when the first state in the doublet acquires the smallest
real energy and changes again to positive (but small in
magnitude) when both states of the doublet have Re( Eα)
smaller than the original topologically non-trivial state.
A closer inspection of the type of phase transition is
shown in Fig. 3, where we do a line cut in the phase dia-
gram for γ2= 0 and 2. That the topological transition in
either Hermitian or non-Hermitian cases coincides with
the emergence of charge order can be inferred by the si-
multaneous drop of the Chern number from one to zero
and the discontinuity of the charge structure factor. As
previously mentioned, such discontinuity is thus accom-
panied by the closing of the real part of the excitation
spectrum, classifying it thus as a first-order phase tran-
sition even when γ2̸= 0. The imaginary part, while it
does not strictly close, also reflects the critical interaction
strength Vc.
Lastly, further characterization of the phase transition
can be obtained by the fidelity susceptibility, a metric
that quantifies the dissimilarity between ground states
upon a small variation of a control parameter. Here, we
compute it via a variation of the real interaction strength
V→V+dV, with dV= 10−3, extracting the fidelity
susceptibility as [90–93]

F=2
Ns1− |⟨ψa(V)|ψb(V+dV)⟩|

For continuous phase transitions, this quantity exhibits
extensive (in the system size) peaks at the critical
point [83, 94–97], whereas first-order phase transitions
are thus characterized by discontinuities whose amplitude
are governed by the small parameter dV[83]. Agreeing
with the analysis of the excitation gaps, we observe the
latter behavior in Fig. 3(d), irrespective of whether γ2
is finite or not. Since it can be computed with differ-
ent combinations of left/right eigenstates, we show the

Lastly, we observe that changing the sign of the dissi-4

pation γ2→ −γ2leads to the same physical results forall quantities we investigate while resulting in the com-
plex conjugation of the spectrum of the effective non-
Hermitian Hamiltonian, Eα→E∗
α. We notice that the
complex conjugation of ˆH(1,2)
effitself changes the chirality
of the edges modes while physically corresponding to the
modification from loss to gain in the dissipation. Such
a procedure does not change the loci of the onset of the
CDW Mott insulating regime or its first-order character-
istics.
Dynamics in the presence of dissipation
Having established the main features of the non-
Hermitian effective Hamiltonian that emerge when the
quantum jump terms are neglected in the quantum mas-
ter equation, we now fully focus on the actual dynamics
under dissipative conditions. Evolution of the full density
matrix, as governed by Eq. (2) is often prohibitive (even
more for the large-Hilbert space size we consider), and an
alternative approach is to take the stochastic evolution of
quantum trajectories instead [98–102]. The rationale is
that the system evolves under the non-Hermitian Hamil-
tonian, with the quantum jumps being stochastically ap-
plied at certain points in time. In such a procedure, the
average of the density matrix (or the corresponding phys-
ical observables) for many “trajectories” (which depend
on the instants where the action of quantum jump terms
take place) converges to the one if the full quantum mas-
ter equation were considered. Since the number of tra-
jectories is relatively small for a satisfactory convergence,
the procedure entails a fraction of the computational cost
– details are given in Appendix B.
Using this procedure, we focus on the dynamics of the5

tities exhibit an exponential decay in time for various
parameter sets but typically display much faster decay
in the case of one-body dissipation. In this case, the
average density quickly departs from half-filling at time
t= 0, and is rather insensitive to the interaction strength
V, while the larger the dissipation rate γ1is, the faster it
decays. As a result, the CDW structure factor necessarily
decreases from its maximum value at half-filling, denot-
ing the melting of the charge ordering at time scales much
shorter than the typical hopping times τ= 1/t1= 1.
In turn, while the decay rates are much slower in the
two-body dissipation case, decay times of the particle
number and Scdware affected by both the interaction
strength Vand the dissipation rate γ2, but here the
deeper one is in the Mott regime, the longer it takes for
the melting of charge order. Lastly, by performing an ex-
ponential fitting of the CDW structure factor of the form
Scdw∝exp(−βt), we compile in Fig. 5 the decay rate β
for both types of dissipation, as a function of the corre-
sponding dissipation rate γ1,2, systematically confirming
these previous features for an extended parameter set.
IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
We investigate the impact of dissipation on the topo-
logically non-trivial and charge-ordered phases of the
Haldane-Hubbard model in its spinless formulation. At
short times, the physics is governed by an effective non-
Hermitian Hamiltonian, which we comprehensively char-
acterize via the Chern number, CDW structure factor,
excitation gaps, and fidelity susceptibility. In this static
case, only two-body dissipation exhibits non-trivial be-
havior, and we notice that it competes with the forma-
tion of a charge-ordered Mott insulator, improving the
resilience of the topological phase to the presence of the
contact interactions V.
Whereas these conclusions are born from the study of
a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that neglects the influence
of the quantum jump terms in the master equation, the
study of the actual dynamics shows that charge ordering6
is also mitigated with dissipation, but rather on a trivial
level: The particle density decreases thus destroying the
Mott insulator state and its corresponding CDW order.
The fact that the particle density exponentially decays
in time also brings challenges for the manifestation of a
non-trivial topological regime.
While it has been demonstrated that the topological
invariant of a quantum system cannot change under uni-
tary transformations [103–105], the presence of dissipa-
tion evades this paradigm, allowing one to dynamically
change the value of the Chern number, for example. Be-
sides that, if a system is then comprised by the simul-
taneous presence of gain and loss, as the one introduced
in Ref. [33] for the Haldane model, the average density
remains close to its initial value at all times, and the
dynamical manipulation of the Chern number becomes
likely feasible. We leave such investigation for future
studies.
Lastly, we stress that the emulation of the Haldane
model with trapped cold atoms in optical lattices [50],
combined with techniques that permit the control of con-
tact (non-local) interactions using Rydberg dressing [55],
represent the ideal platform to experimentally study the
results we numerically unveil, even more so because atom
loss is an inherent effect in these experiments. Similar
to what we observe, an exponential decay on the atom
number has been reported in Ref. [55] melting a charge-
density wave state whose dissipation mechanism is akin
to the single-particle loss we investigate.

Appendix A: Left and right eigenstates
In the main text, we present results for physical quanti-
ties when using the right eigenstates, i.e., the ones satisfy-
ingˆHeff|αR⟩=Eα|αR⟩. We notice that one could equally
use left eigenvectors, defined as ˆH†
eff|αL⟩=E∗
α|αL⟩. Fig-
ure 6 shows the results for different combinations of left
and right eigenvectors for both the CDW structure fac-
tor [Fig. 6(a)] and the fidelity susceptibility [Fig. 6(b)].
The first-order phase transition is clearly captured, re-
sulting in sharp discontinuities for both quantities at the
critical interactions. Quantitative differences appear ow-
ing to the flexibility in how to mutually define the inner
products [106] ⟨αL|αR⟩,⟨αL|αL⟩, and ⟨αR|αR⟩[our re-
sults consider ⟨αL|αL⟩=⟨αR|αR⟩= 1], but qualitatively
the results reflect the same physical behavior.

Appendix B: Quantum trajectory method
Given initial density matrix ˆ ρ(t0) =P
αpα|α⟩⟨α|, in
which 0 ≤pα≤1 andP
αpα= 1, our objective is to
simulate the dynamics of ρ(t) in the time interval [ t0, tf].
The main part of the quantum trajectory method is to
generate stochastically different evolution paths of wave
functions in [ t0, tf], namely trajectories, and each observ-
able quantity is averaged over all the trajectories to get
its expected value. The generation of each trajectory is
given by the following algorithm [100, 102]:
1. Randomly choose the initial state |ϕ(0)⟩=|α⟩ac-
cording to the probabilities pα.
2. Generate a random number rfrom a uniform dis-
tribution in [0 ,1].
3. Propagate |ϕ(t)⟩according to
id
dt|ϕ(t)⟩=ˆHeff|ϕ(t)⟩ (B1)
until time t−where ∥|ϕ(t−)⟩∥2=r.
4. Calculate weights wi=√γiˆLi|ϕ(t−)⟩and ran-
domly choose the jump channel iaccording to the
probabilities pi=wi/P
iwi.
5. Calculate the normalized wave function after the
quantum jump by
|ϕ(t+)⟩=ˆLi|ϕ(t−)⟩ˆLi|ϕ(t−)⟩. (B2)
6. Go to 2 and continue the evolution of |ϕ(t)⟩until
t=tf.7
After getting enough independent trajectories, an ap-
proximation of the density matrix is given by
ρ(t) = |ϕ(t)⟩⟨ϕ(t)|
⟨ϕ(t)|ϕ(t)⟩ 
, (B3)
where ⟨⟨·⟩⟩denotes the average over all computed tra-
jectories. In our calculations, we run 200 independent
trajectories to extract the average value of the relevantobservables ( Scdwand total density), resulting in a small
standard error for its average value. Furthermore, in step
1, the initial state is taken as the ground state of the
Hermitian Hamiltonian [Eq. (1)] for the given parame-
ters set, and the time integration in step 3 is performed
via a restarted Krylov solver method [87, 107]. Lastly,
since step 5 inherently breaks spatial translation invari-
ance, we do not consider this symmetry in building ˆHeff
for the dynamics.
