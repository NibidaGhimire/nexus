 Supplementary Note 1: Relation between the classical XY Hamiltonian and the experimental parameters  
In this section, the method of calculating XY Hamiltonians with the experimental parameters of the photonic simulator 
is discussed in detail. In this discussion, only XY models in absence of external fields are considered, and the Hamiltonian 
of the ܰ-spin XY model is:  
񯿿= −1

௜,௝, (S1) 
where ࡶ=൫󏿿௜௝൯  is the interaction matrix and ࡿ௜=(cosߠ௜,sinߠ௜)  denotes a two-dimensional, unit-length vector. For 
simplicity, we assume that ࡶ is a real symmetric matrix (the asymmetric ࡶ can be converted to a symmetric matrix (ࡶ−
ࡶ୘)/2 without affecting the Hamiltonian). The XY Hamiltonian can also be expressed with the quadratic form  [1]:

where ࢨ=[exp(iߠଵ),exp(iߠଶ),…,exp(iߠே)]୘ is the complex spin configuration vector, and the superscripts H and T 
denote the conjugate transpose and the transpose respectively. By using the eigen-decomposition, the real symmetric matrix 
ࡶ can be expressed as:  
ࡶ=ࢁୌࢁࢫ,( S3) 
where ࢫ= diag(ߣଵ,ߣଶ,…,ߣே)  is the diagonal eigenvalue matrix with ܰ  eigenvalues ߣଵ,ߣଶ,…,ߣே , and ࢁ  is the 
unitary eigenvector matrix composed by eigenvectors ࢛ଵ,࢛ଶ,…,࢛ே. Before the next operation, we have to check whether 
ࡶ is positive semi-definite, which means all of its eigenvalues are non-negative:  
Step (1). If the lowest eigenvalue of ࡶ is non-negative, skip step (2).  
Step (2). If the lowest eigenvalue of ࡶ is negative, modify the diagonal elements of ࡶ to ensure that all of its eigenvalues 
are non-negative. Such modification of ࡶ will only introduce a global offset of the XY Hamiltonian, and will not affect 
the relative Hamiltonian. Here we list two methods of modifying ࡶ: 
(i) Replace each original diagonal element 󏿿௜௜ by ∑ห󏿿௜௝ห ௝,௜ஷ௝ to ensure the new interaction matrix ࡶ′ is diagonally 
dominant  [2]. 
(ii) Denote the lowest eigenvalue by ߣ୫୧୬ . Define the new interaction matrix ࡶᇱ=ࡶ+|ߣ୫୧୬|ࡵ . Since ࡶᇱ࢛௜=
(ࡶ+|ߣ୫୧୬|ࡵ)࢛௜= (ߣ௜+|ߣ୫୧୬|)࢛௜ , ࡶᇱ  has the non-negative eigenvalues ߣଵ+|ߣ୫୧୬|,ߣଶ+|ߣ୫୧୬|,…,ߣே+
|ߣ୫୧୬| and eigenvectors ࢛ଵ,࢛ଶ,…,࢛ே. 
In the following discussion, we use ࡶ , ࢫ , and 񯿿  to denote the new interaction matrix, eigenvalue matrix, and 
Hamiltonian after modifying the original interaction matrix respectively for simplicity. According to Eq. (S2),  
񯿿(ࢨ)= −1

2ቀ√ࢫୌࢨࢁቁୌ
൫√ࢫࢨࢁ൯. (S4) 
Since ߣଵ,ߣଶ,…,ߣே≥ 0, √ࢫୌ=√ࢫ .By introducing ࡭=√ࢫࢁ the XY Hamiltonian can be expressed as  
񯿿(ࢨ)= −1
2(ࢨ࡭)ୌ(ࢨ࡭).( S5) 
Therefore, we set the transform matrix to ࡭  and the input vector to ࢨ  in the optical vector-matrix multiplication 
(OVMM). The output field is ࡱ=ࢨ࡭=[𿿿ଵ,𿿿ଶ,…,𿿿ே]୘, and the measured intensity vector is  
ࡵ=ࡱ∗⊙ࡱ=[|𿿿ଵ|ଶ,|𿿿ଶ|ଶ,…,|𿿿ே|ଶ]୘=[򟿿ଵ…򟿿௞򟿿௞ାଵ…򟿿ே]୘, (S6) 
where the superscript * denotes the complex conjugation, and ⊙  denotes element-wise multiplication. Thus, the XY 
Hamiltonian could be expressed with  
񯿿(ࢨ)= −1
2ࡱୌࡱ= −1

In conclusion, in the pretreatment stage, the required transformation matrix ࡭ is obtained by the eigen-decomposition of 
the modified interaction matrix ࡶ and the Hamiltonian can be calculated by summing the measured intensities of the output 
field. 3 
 Supplementary Note 2: Experimental setup of the photonic simulator  
Fig. S1 shows the experimental setup of the photonic simulator for the classical XY model, which mainly comprises 
a laser module (ORION 1550nm Laser Module), three spatial light modulators (SLMs, HOLOEYE PLUTO-2.1-TELCO-
013), a camera (Hamamatsu InGaAs Camera C12741-03), and a processor. Fig. S2 shows the principle of the optical vector-
matrix multiplication (OVMM) system. The laser beam from the collimator is incident on the OVMM based on SLMs. The 
pattern on SLM0 shown in Fig. S3(a) splits the incident beam to ܯ beams (ܯ is the dimensionality of the transformation 
matrix). Here the beam-splitting ratio represents the ratio of the complex amplitudes of the ܯ beams. For SLM0, the 
complex beam-splitting ratio is the same as the target input vector denoted by ࡮=[ܾଵ,ܾଶ,…,ܾெ]୘, as shown in Fig. S2. 
The ܯ beams then incident on ܯ different regions of SLM1 shown in Fig. S3(b) respectively. Likewise, each region on 
SLM1 splits the incident beam to ܯ different regions on SLM2 shown in Fig. S3(c) respectively, and the complex splitting 
ratio of each region corresponds to each column of the transformation matrix ࡭=൫ܽ௜௝൯ respectively. For instance, the 
region ݅  on SLM1 splits the incident beam ݅  to ܯ  beams with complex amplitudes of ܽ௜ଵܾ௜,ܽ௜ଶܾ௜,…,ܽ௜ெܾ௜ 
respectively, as shown in Fig. S2. Then the region ݅ on SLM2 equally recombines the ܯ incident beams from the ܯ 
regions on SLM1 to a same direction on the output plane, resulting in an output amplitude of ܿ௜=∑ܽ௜௝ܾ௝ெ
௝ୀଵ, as shown in 
Fig. S2. Each SLM pattern is optimized with a gradient-descent algorithm from the superposition of a series of blazed 
gratings, and the detailed pattern generation method is provided in the supplementary information of our previous work  [3]. 
As mentioned above, the input vector is encoded on SLM1 by appending phase delays equal to the spin angles to the 
corresponding regions respectively. Besides, since our employed SLMs are reflective, a blazed grating is appended to each 
SLM to concentrate the intensity in the first diffraction order. Finally, a camera (Hamamatsu InGaAs Camera C12741-03) 
detects the output optical intensities, which will be used to calculate the Hamiltonian corresponding to the spin 
configuration with the processor. Besides, the processor generates the next spin configuration according to the employed 
algorithm, and updates it to SLM1 iteratively until the algorithm terminates. The distances between the devices are: SLM0 
to SLM1: 0.820m; SLM1 to SLM2: 0.754m; SLM2 to pinhole: 0.373m.

Supplementary Note 3: Calibration of the SLM phase patterns for OVMM  
When employing the phase patterns generated from the ideal conditions, the actual transformation matrix would 
deviate from the target transformation matrix due to the misalignment and paraxial approximations. Therefore, the 
calibrations of both amplitude and phase terms are essential to reduce the systematic error. In this section, we use ￿୧୬ 
6 
 and ￿୭୳୲ to denote the matrix input to the pattern-generation algorithm and the actual transformation matrix of the 
OVMM respectively, and  
￿௜௝୧୬=￿௜௝୭୳୲exp൫i߳௜௝൯, (S8) 
where the phase error ߳௜௝ is independent of ￿୧୬. To measure the phase error, one of the ܯ beams incident on SLM1 is 
used as a reference beam (denoted as beam 1) to interference with one of the rest of the beams (denoted as beam ݆ ,݆=
2,3,…,ܯ )separately. The element ݅( ݅= 1,2,…, ܯ )of the output intensity vector is  
򟿿௜௝ୡ୭ୱ=ห￿௜ଵ୭୳୲exp(i߳௜ଵ)+￿௜௝୭୳୲exp൫i߳௜௝൯หଶ. (S9) 
Then we use beam 1 to interfere beam ݆ with phase delay ߨ/2: 
򟿿௜௝ୱ୧୬=ห￿௜ଵ୭୳୲exp(i߳௜ଵ)+i￿௜௝୭୳୲exp൫i߳௜௝൯หଶ. (S10) 
It is reasonable to set the phase of the reference beam ߳௜ଵ= 0. Now we can obtain the phase compensation  
߳௜௝=

where ￿௜௝୭୳୲ can be obtained from the output intensities when each beam exists alone. By modifying the input matrix by 
￿௜௝୧୬exp൫−i߳௜௝൯, the phase error can be well compensated.  
The amplitude calibration can be conducted by ￿௜௝୧୬→￿௜௝୧୬ห￿௜௝୲ୟ୰୥ୣ୲ห/￿௜௝୭୳୲ repeatedly. The detailed procedure of the 
calibration method is provided in the supplementary information of the previous work  [3,4]. 
Supplementary Note 4: Fidelities of the transformation matrices of the OVMM  
In this section, the fidelities of the transformation matrices are provided. Fig. S4(a)-(c) show the interaction matrices 
ࡶ of the two-dimensional (2D) XY model, and model 1-2 respectively. It should be mentioned that the matrices shown in 
Fig. S4(a)-(c) are the modified positive semi-definite matrices according to Supplementary Note 1. Fig. S4(d)-(f) show the 
transformation matrices ࡭  of the OVMM corresponding to Fig. S4(a)-(c), respectively. To measure the actual 
experimental transformation matrix, the input vector is set to each column of the identity matrix successively, and then the 
output vectors form the output intensity matrix ࡵா. Fig. S4(g)-(i) show the theoretical output intensity matrices ࡵ்=࡭⊙
࡭∗, while Fig. S4(j)-(l) show the ࡵா corresponding to Fig. S4(d)-(f), respectively. It can be seen that the ࡵ் and the ࡵா 
are very close to each other in each model. According to the definition of the fidelity of the transformation matrix  [3] 
݂mat=∑ (ࡵ𿿿)݆݅(ࡵܶ)݆݆݅݅

we obtain the high matrix fidelities of 0.99997, 0.99887, and 0.99880 in the experiments of the 2D XY model, and model 
1-2 respectively.   7

 Supplementary Note 5: The accuracy of the output intensity vectors of the OVMM  
Besides the transformation matrix, the accuracy of the output intensity vectors is also investigated with two parameters. 
The first parameter is the fidelity of the intensity vector defined by  [3] 
݂୴ୣୡ=∑൫ࡵୣ୶୮൯௜(ࡵ୲୦ୣ୭)௜ ௜

௜,݂୴ୣୡ∈[0,1], (S13) 
where ࡵexp denotes the experimental output intensity vector, while ࡵtheo denotes the theoretical one. The more the 
two vectors are parallel, the more ݂vec is close to 1. The second parameter is the intensity stability parameter 󿿿, 
which is defined by ∑൫ࡵexp൯݅݅/∑(ࡵtheo)݅݅  and expected to be a constant. Due to the non-idealities and the detection 
noise in the experiment, ݂vec< 1 and 󿿿 distributes within a small range. Fig. S5(a)-(c) show the average fidelities 
of all samplings in each temperature stage of the 2D model and in each run of model 1-2, respectively. The overall 
average fidelities in Fig. S5(a)-(c) are 0.9964±0.0039, 0.9970±0.0033, and 0.9967±0.0031, respectively. Fig. S5(d)-
(f) show the average values of 󿿿 of all samplings in each temperature stage of the 2D model and in each run of 
model 1-2, respectively. The overall average 󿿿 in Fig. S5(d)-(f) are (2.736±0.104)×103, (1.472±0.055)×102, and 
85.38±2.39 respectively, and the relative deviations are 3.8%, 3.7% and 2.8% respectively. The high vector fidelities 
and high stability of 󿿿 indicate that the OVMM in our photonic simulator is quite accurate.

 Supplementary Note 6: The normalization of the experimental Hamiltonians and the successful probability of the 
ground state search  
In the experiment, the raw Hamiltonians 񯿿exp of the samplings are calculated from the measured optical intensities. 
Fig. S6(a)/(b) show the 50 raw accepted Hamiltonian curves of the ground state search of model 1/2, respectively. In 
Supplementary Note 5, the average values intensity stability parameter 󿿿 of each run is calculated. Thus, the normalized 
experimental Hamiltonian 񯿿n can be obtained by 񯿿n=񯿿exp/󿿿. It should be mentioned that, the theoretical annealing 
temperature of the 2D model is obtained with ܶ=ܶexp/󿿿 , where ܶexp  is the annealing temperature in the 
experiment. The 50 curves in Fig. S6(a)/(b) are normalized according to their own average 󿿿 respectively, and the 
results are shown in Fig. S6(c)/(d).  
Actually, we are concerned about whether the theoretical Hamiltonians of the accepted spin states are close 
enough to the ground state Hamiltonians. Therefore, the theoretical Hamiltonians of the accepted states are calculated, 
and the 50 theoretical Hamiltonian curves of model 1/2 are shown in Fig. S6(e)/(f). As mentioned in the main text, 
we consider a state sampling to be successful when its accepted theoretical Hamiltonian is lower than the ground 
state Hamiltonian (obtained with fast simulated annealing with the same parameters  [5,6]) multiplied by a tolerance 
coefficient ߟ .Thus, we calculated the successful probabilities of each iteration, which denotes the proportion of the 
successful samplings in 50 runs, under different ߟ  from 0.85 to 0.95 with the interval of 0.01. The successful 
probability curves of model 1/2 are shown in Fig. S6(g)/(h). From these results, it can seen that the final successful 
probabilities are almost 1 when ߟ≤ 0.9, while they quickly decay when ߟ> 0.9. Such decay mainly results from 
the detection noise of the camera  [3], which would make our photonic simulator unable to distinguish two spin 
configurations when their Hamiltonian difference is lower than the noise level.
