We investigate a granular aluminium quantum circuit with an anharmonicity of the order of its
decoherence rate in a 3-dimensional microwave cavity. We perform single qubit-like manipulations
such as Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes. Our findings, supported by quantitative numerical
modeling, show that a very weakly anharmonic oscillator can also display quantum oscillations
outside the qubit regime. These oscillations are hard to disambiguate from qubit oscillations in
time domain measurements for a single driving frequency. This sheds new light on recent findings
for new material superconducting quantum bits. Our platform shows in addition large magnetic
field resilience which could find applications for quantum enhanced dark matter search.

Superconducting circuits have become a major plat-
form for quantum information processing and quantum
amplification. Whereas the conventional Josephson junc-
tion has been extensively used so far, many efforts aim
to replace it by more elaborated materials which range
from semiconducting nanowires [1] or nanotubes [2] to
2D materials [3–5]. Such setups would offer an enhanced
electrical tunability (via e.g. gate electrodes) and mag-
netic field resilience. Both these aspects could be cru-
cial regarding new applications for quantum sensing or
for scaling up quantum information processing platforms
[3–5]. In particular, the potential for quantum sensing
applications range from quantum amplification of cos-
mological signals to read-out of topological systems.
These new platforms are appealing in terms of tech-
nology, but they often display a reduced anharmonicity
which could endanger their qubit character. This moti-
vates the detailed study of the dynamics of such systems
at the frontier between the harmonic and the anharmonic
regime, i.e. when the anharmonicity is comparable to the
damping rate of these oscillators. In this context, the use
of a simple superconducting material offering both low
anharmonicity and weak losses without the inherent com-
plexity of low dimensional materials would be appealing.
Granular aluminium (grAl) is such a material. It can be
used both in the extreme weak anharmonic regime and
in the qubit regime [6, 7, 10–12]. It is therefore ideal to
study the above mentionned crossover.
In this work, we use a grAl based quantum circuit in
the extreme weak anharmonic regime. We show that we
can perform qubit-like manipulations such as Rabi os-
cillations and Ramsey interferometry. However, the dy-
namics of the circuit involve many oscillator levels. This

behavior is understood quantitatively by a simple quan-
tum model of an anharmonic oscillator. By the analysis
of the Rabi chevron patterns and the Ramsey fringes, we
can assess about the ”quantumness” of the observed os-
cillations. We show in particular that single time domain
traces in these systems can easily mimic qubit dynamicsarXiv:2401.04227v1  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  8 Jan 20242
both for Rabi and Ramsey oscillations. Doing so, we
benchmark the time domain oscillations in the weak an-
harmonic regime. In addition, we are able to drive our
circuit up to 0 .7 T, making our simple grAl circuit ap-
pealing for magnetic field resilient quantum sensing ap-
plications.
The Josephson junction is mounted in a copper 3-
dimensional (3D) microwave cavity with a fundamental
frequency of about ωcav= 2π×6.0 GHz and a quality
factor Q= 2700 at low temperature. The whole setup
is mounted in a dilution refrigerator with a standard
microwave setup [8] and all the measurements are car-
ried out at T≈20 mK. Such a geometry is that of
a ”3D-transmon” [9, 10]. The details of the nanofab-
rication are given in the Supplementary. From the DC
switching current measurements, we estimate the super-
current as shown in [13] to Ic≈600 nA(see Supplemen-
tary). The inductance of the circuit is estimated to LJ≈
1.63 nH from the Mattis-Bardeen formula [10]. From mi-
crowave simulations, we estimate for the layout of fig-
ure 1, which yields a charging energy of EC≈47 MHz,
which yields a resonance frequency of 6 .14 GHz, close
to our measurements. In addition, from the DC mea-
surements stated above, we can expect a transmon an-
harmonicity of K0≈ Cπaω2
1/jcVgrAl≈250 kHz, with
C= 3/16 and a= 5 nm[10, 12], abeing the Al grain
size. The parameters of our circuit can be determined
experimentally by the microwave two-tone spectroscopy
which is shown in figure 1c, detuned from the cavity
mode. We observe a clear dip at 5 .9102 GHz which dis-
plays the characteristic asymmetric lineshape of an an-
harmonic oscillator as the power of the microwave in-
put signal is increased. The linewidth at lowest power is
Γexp≈2π×0.935 MHz ±0.1 MHz, as fitted by the black
line. From the shift towards low frequencies of the edge
of the transmon resonance and the phase contrast as the
power is increased shown in figure 1d, we calibrate the
microwave power and estimate a Kerr anharmonicity of
about Kexp≈2π×250 kHz and a coupling between the
cavity and the transmon of about g≈16 MHz. Details
on this calculation can be found in the supplementary
material [14]. This is in good agreement with the ex-
pected anharmonicity given the inherent uncertainty on
the grain size of the GrAl. The linewidth observed at
lowest power is directly related to the decoherence rate
of the circuit. This places our circuit in the regime of ex-
treme weak anharmonicity where Kexp≲Γexp. Does this
regime enable quantum oscillations such as Rabi-like os-
cillations and Ramsey fringes which are usual signatures
of driven quantum systems? This question is addressed
in the subsequent part of the paper.
We first study Rabi oscillations as a function of the
time τRof the excitation burst and the carrier frequency
fdr, at zero external magnetic field B(see figure 2a). The
state of the circuit is measured using the conventional dis-
persive readout i.e. the phase φof the microwave signal

at the cavity resonance frequency fcav= 6.0 GHz here.
The phase contrast ∆ φis simply related to the popula-
tion of the circuit via ∆ φ= 2χ⟨ˆb†ˆb⟩/κwhere χis the
cross-Kerr coupling between the cavity photons and the
circuit, κis the cavity linewidth and ˆbis the transmon
annihilation operator of the weakly anharmonic oscilla-
tor picture for our circuit. Defining gas the circuit-cavity
coupling strength, we have χ=−2Kg2/(fcav−f0)2. The
specific power of the drive and the cavity readout pulses
are respectively Pdr=−78 dBm and Pcav=−103 dBm.
As explained above, the phase contrast is a direct mea-
surement of ⟨ˆb†ˆb⟩. As shown in figure 2a, we observe
the characteristic fringes witnessing Rabi oscillations for
conventional qubits. Nevertheless, we should stress that
this is different regime from the qubit regime. This is
first qualitatively shown by the observed unusual ”Rabi
chevron” pattern. Two features are particularly striking:
first, the ”chevron pattern” seems truncated below the
continuous wave resonance frequency ; second, a closer
inspection of the oscillations shows that they are non-
sinuso¨ ıdal. Interestingly, the asymmetry can be qualita-
tively recovered by stating that, similarly to the two level
system case, the chevrons result from a multiplication of3
the frequency envelope of the transition and the time do-
main damped Rabi oscillations. In such a heuristic pic-
ture, the asymmetry stems simply from the asymmetry
of the lineshape of a Duffing oscillator.
It is possible to numerically model the dynamics of
the circuit using as input parameters K, Γ and the driv-
ing amplitude of the circuit thanks to the Qutip Python
package. The simulation is run in the rotating frame
by varying the detuning ∆ fdrbetween the drive and ω0.
The result of such a simulation is shown in figure 2b,
where the driving frequency has been fixed using the fre-
quency of the point with maximum contrast in the ex-
periment. We find an excellent agreement with the data
forK= 2π×200 kHz and Γ = 2 π×0.954 MHz. These
values are close to those determined independently by
the continuous wave spectroscopy of the circuit in figure
1c. Interestingly, the population ⟨ˆb†ˆb⟩of the transmon
which is encoded in the phase contrast is found to oscil-
late between nearly 0 to about 60. This shows that we are
not in a qubit regime although we can observe quantum
oscillations of the state of our circuit. The agreement be-
tween the modeling and the data is further exemplified
in figure 2c and d. In order to further test the validity
of the numerical simulation for modeling our circuit, it is
interesting to Fourier transform the time domain signals.
This is shown in figures 2e and f (for the experiment and
the theory respectively). We observe again an excellent
agreement and all the features observed experimentally
are observed in the modeling. In particular, we identify
a linear behavior at large positive or negative detuning.
This is a sinuso¨ ıdal regime with a simple broadening aris-
ing from the decay rate of the circuit. In addition, the
general features are strongly asymmetric in the detun-
ing (vertical) axis. Such a behavior is not expected for
a spin 1 /2 or a conventional transmon qubit as it should
be symmetric and scale like Ω qubit=p
Ω2
0+ (ωdr−ω0)2,
where ωdr= 2πfdrand Ω 0is a linear function of the
drive amplitude δ. This is one important qualitative dif-
ference with our circuit. Close to 5 .88 GHz, we observe a
broad feature in the spectrum indicating a non-sinuso¨ ıdal
behavior. Rabi-like oscillations are observed here in a
regime totally different than conventional qubits.
The observed ”Rabi chevron” pattern is specific to the
weakly anharmonic regime. It is interesting to put our
findings in perspective with recent works using e.g. 2D
material as a weak link for replacing the Josephson junc-
tion [3–5]. In reference [4] in particular, there is a striking
similarity of the observed ”Rabi chevron” patterns with
figure 2a. The immediate consequence of our findings is
that it seems difficult to distinguish between the extreme
weak anharmonic regime and the qubit regime simply
by measuring individual time-domain cuts at a given de-
tuning. We will see below that this holds true even if
Ramsey-like fringes are observed.

of Nb, which has a rather high critical field, combined

by the magnetic field resilience of GrAl films makes it
possible to operate our superconducting circuits at high
magnetic field. This is shown in figure 3. Each of the
panels corresponds to a different magnetic field ranging
from 0 .15 T to 0 .7 T. Whereas the Rabi chevrons are
barely affected at 0 .15 T, they are more affected at 0 .7 T,
but still clearly visible. The decoherence time decreases
from TRabi≈1.25µs toTRabi≈0.3µs. We attribute this
decrease to the slight misalignment between the B-field
axis and the plane of the quantum circuit. Interestingly,
we find a B-field resilience up to 0 .2 T in out of plane B-
field [14]. This is about two orders of magnitude larger
than conventional superconducting qubits or grAl based
resonators[16].
How quantum are our observed oscillations if we are
not in a qubit limit? This question echoes with the old
debate on whether a weak anharmonic oscillator display-
ing Rabi oscillations can at all be considered as a quan-
tum system or not [17–19]. In our case, the Rabi chevron
pattern is a strong discriminator between the classical
and the quantum model which has an excellent agreement
with our experiment. In particular, we can compare the
expected frequency content between the two models. In
the classical model, a single Rabi frequency is expected
Ωcla=A(δ)|ωdr−ω0|, with A(δ) a sublinear function of
the driving amplitude a. Such an expression contrasts
with the qubit case Ω qubit which contains in addition a
”transverse Rabi field” arising from the driving of the
effective two level system in the rotating frame. The ex-
pression of Ω clameans that we should expect only two
symmetric lines in the maps 2e,f. While at large detun-
ing around 5 .87 GHz or 5 .90 GHz a linear dispersion is
present, this is clearly not the case at low detuning both
in terms of frequency content and dispersion, as high-
lighted by the dashed lines in figure 2e,f. Thus, our find-
ings are not explained by the classical anharmonic model.
This further validates that we observe quantum oscilla-
tions in the time domain manipulation of our transmon4
circuit.

The final picture for the dynamics of our system can be
sketched by performing Ramsey interferometry. A first
pulse of duration τ0= 30 ns with Pdr=−78 dBm is
followed by a waiting time τRamsey , by a second τ0with
Pdr=−78 dBm and by a readout pulse. As in the con-
ventional Ramsey interferometry setup, they correspond
to half of one modulation in the Rabi sequence between
the low and high number of quanta in figure 2c. As shown
in the 2D map of figure 4a, we observe fringes which are
the result of Ramsey interferences taking place in our cir-
cuit. Ramsey fringes are slightly asymmetrical, however,
whereas there was a clear qualitative difference between
the observed Rabi chevron pattern and that expected for
a qubit, the asymmetry in the Ramsey fringes is not as
noticeable. The difference in frequency between the Rabi
chevrons of figure 2 and the Ramsey fringes is due to a
slight shift of the circuit frequency. The simulation of
this experiment is shown in figure 4b. The duration of
the pulses is 31 ns. The parameters are the same as in the
Rabi chevrons simulation of figure 2, and the frequency
offset is again set using the point of maximum contrast
in the measurement. As for the Rabi chevrons, the mod-
elling of the Ramsey interferometry reproduces closely
the behaviour of the device. Ramsey oscillations after a
pulse π/2 are shown in 2b for the measurement and the
simulation. The frequency and length of the pulses are5.91 GHz and 20 ns for the measurement and 5 .9106 GHz
and 21 ns in the simulation. We find an excellent agree-
ment between the two curves. This agreement is also
shown for time traces in figure 4c. As in the Rabi oscilla-
tions, they differ from the sinusoidal oscillations expected
for Ramsey fringes in a 2 level system. We are led to con-
clude that the Rabi chevron pattern is more discriminant
for disambiguating the qubit and the weak anharmonic
regime although the quantitative analysis of both fringes
reveals strong difference with the qubit case. Since we
find a very good agreement between the modeling and
our experimental findings, it is interesting to further sim-
ulate the Wigner tomography expected for different pulse
times of our weakly anharmonic oscillator. Such a result
is shown in figures 4c,d,e,f. We show the Wigner func-
tions for pulse times tpulse = 0, τ0,2τ0,3τ0,70τ0. Except
from the starting point in vacuum, we see that there are
clear signatures of non-classicality in the form of squeez-
ing and negative parts in the Wigner tomography. Inter-
estingly, the 2 τ0leads to the most non-classical state as it
displays negative forming a blue crescent in the Wigner
function whereas τ0displays simple squeezing. This is
also a strong difference with the qubit case. In our sys-
tem, the pulse time τ0does not play a special role like
for a qubit.
As a conclusion, we have investigated a simple super-
conducting circuit made out of a granular aluminium
Josephson junction in the time domain. We observe
quantum oscillations i.e. Rabi oscillations and Ramsey
fringes. We have a quantitative understanding of the
Rabi oscillations in the extreme weak anharmonic regime
and the Ramsey fringes are qualitatively similar to the
qubit regime. Although our quantum circuit is not a
quantum bit, it displays all the requested features for
quantum sensing and quantum amplification. In partic-
ular, we could in principle use it in the photon num-
ber resolved regime to use it as a single photon detector.
Such detectors have been put forward recently for quan-
tum sensing of cosmological objects using conventional
transmon qubits. However, a major hurdle for the use of
these single photon detector is magnetic field resilience.
For example, there is a strong motivation to sense sin-
gle microwave photon for quantum enhanced axion dark
matter search [20] in cavities in strong magnetic field.
Our quantum circuit could therefore have interesting ap-
plications for quantum sensing of cosmological signals.
