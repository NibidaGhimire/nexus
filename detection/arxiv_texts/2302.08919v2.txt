PLURIPOTENTIAL HOMOTOPY THEORY
JONAS STELZIG
Abstract. We build free, bigraded bidifferential algebra models for the forms
on a complex manifold, with respect to a strong notion of quasi-isomorphism
and compatible with the conjugation symmetry. This answers a question of
Sullivan. The resulting theory naturally accomodates higher operations in-
volving double primitives. As applications, we obtain various refinements of
the homotopy groups, sensitive to the complex structure. Under a simple con-
nectedness assumption, one obtains minimal models which are unique up to
isomorphism and allow for explicit computations of the new invariants.
Introduction
Consider the following vague
Question. What is the ‘holomorphic’ extra structure on the homotopy type of a
complex manifold?
To explain what shape an answer could take, consider the case of cohomology:
The presence of a complex structure on a manifold Xequips the complex of C-
valued differential forms AXwith a bigrading for which the differential d=∂+¯∂
decomposes into components of type (1,0)and(0,1). As a consequence of this
simple observation there is a large collection of cohomology theories sensitive to
the complex structure. For example, the de Rham cohomology is naturally a bifil-
tered vector space and one has the Dolbeault, Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomologies
[Dol56], [BC65], [Aep62]
H¯∂:=ker¯∂
im¯∂, H BC:=ker∂∩ker¯∂
im∂¯∂, H A:=ker∂¯∂
im∂+ im ¯∂,
and many more (e.g. [Frö55], [Var86], [Sch07], [PSU21]).
On the other hand, if one also takes into account the multiplicative structure,
the graded-commutative differential graded algebra (cdga) of complex forms AX,
together with conjugation, represents the real homotopy type of a (say, simply-
connected) manifold [DGMS75], [Su77], [BG76]. To access the homotopy infor-
mation, one has to choose a nilpotent model, i.e. a de Rham quasi-isomorphism
ΛV→AXfrom a cdga which is free as an algebra and satisfies a nilpotency con-
dition recalled below (this amounts to a cofibrant replacement with respect to an
appropriate model category structure). One is thus led to the following
Question (Sullivan).Is there a free bigraded model for the cdga of forms on a
complex manifold, invariant by conjugation?
We will give a positive answer to Sullivan’s question both in a conceptual and
a computational sense. Before stating it, let us discuss quasi-isomorphisms. Given
a map f:ΛV→AXwhere both sides are bigraded and frespects this structure,
one may ask more of fthan inducing an isomorphism in total cohomology. For
example, one may require H¯∂(f)to be an isomorphism, which implies HdR(f)to
be an isomorphism if both sides are bounded, by a spectral sequence argument.
We will use an even stronger notion that does not require boundedness assump-
tions: Namely, let us say fis a bigraded, or pluripotential, quasi-isomorphism if
1arXiv:2302.08919v2  [math.AT]  14 Nov 2024the induced maps HBC(f)andHA(f)are isomorphisms. This quasi-isomorphism
property is universal in a sense made precise in Theorem C below. In particular,
the induced maps in row-, column and total cohomology are isomorphisms.
The conceptual answer to Sullivan’s question then reads:
Theorem A. The category of augmented, graded-commutative, bigraded, bidiffer-
ential algebras (cbba’s) with a real structure carries a model category structure such
that weak equivalences are bigraded quasi-isomorphisms and the cofibrant replace-
ment of any cbba is nilpotent.
Here, as in the singly graded case, a cbba is called nilpotent if it admits a
presentation as a free bigraded algebra ΛVwith a well-ordered bigraded basis for
Vsuch that the differential of every basis element lies in the subalgebra generated
by the smaller basis elements.
Equipping the space of generators of a cofibrant replacement of AXaugmented
by evaluation at a point x∈X, with the linear part of the differentials, one can
functorially associate to any pointed complex manifold a ‘homotopy bicomplex’
π·,·(X, x). For simply connected (resp. nilpotent) spaces, the total cohomology of
π·,·(X, x)recovers the dual of the complexified homotopy groups (and the dual of
theMal’cevcompletionof π1(X, x)). Further, oneobtainsahomotopyversion π♠of
any other cohomological functor H♠(e.g. H¯∂, HBC, Schweitzer cohomologies, ... or
also universal diagrams involving these). In particular, one obtains a commutative
diagram of maps and spectral sequences
πp,q
BC(X, x)
πp,q
¯∂(X, x) (πp+q(X, x)⊗C)∨πp,q
∂(X, x)
πp,q
A(X, x)
The cofibrant replacements arising from Theorem A make the functorial char-
acter of the theory evident, but they are very large. Just as in ordinary rational
homotopy theory, for effective calculations, one wants ‘minimal’ models. In the
singly graded case, a nilpotent model is called minimal if dhas no linear part.
Analogously, we call a cbba model bigradedly minimal if ∂¯∂has no linear part.
The computational answer to Sullivan’s question then reads:
Theorem B. For any connected compact complex manifold which is holomorphi-
cally simply connected, there exists a connected, real, degree-wise finite dimensional,
bigradedly minimal model for the cbba of forms, which is unique up to isomorphism.
Here, a connected compact complex manifold Xis called holomorphically simply
connected, if H1
A(X):=H1,0
A(X)⊕H0,1
A(X) = 0. This holds for example on com-
pact Kähler manifolds with b1(X) = 0. A cbba Mis called connected if it is concen-
trated in non-negative total degree and satisfies M0=C. When a connected model
exists, it is automatically an augmented model for any augmentation of the original
algebra and so the choice of base-point becomes irrelevant (c.f. Corollary 2.36). In
the non-simply connected case, connected, degree-wise finite-dimensional models
may or may not exist and we give examples for both cases. The case of a compact
Kähler manifold with the Hodge diamond of a complete intersection will be studied
in detail, in particular we obtain a formality result (c.f. Theorem 3.5).
To prove the above results, we first revisit the additive theory, i.e. we study the
(symmetric monoidal) category of bicomplexes which, as the category of (bigraded)
2representations of a Frobenius algebra, has a natural model category structure. The
associated homotopy category Ho(BiCo) can be naturally identified with the stable
category of bicomplexes as in [Hap88], [KQ20] and the notion of bigraded quasi-
isomorphism introduced above appears naturally in this context, namely:
Theorem C. For a map f:A→Bof bicomplexes the following statements are
equivalent:
(1) The map fis an isomorphism in Ho(BiCo) .
(2) The maps HBC(f)andHA(f)are isomorphisms.
(3) For any additive functor Hfrom the category of bicomplexes to an additive
category, vanishing on projective bicomplexes, H(f)is an isomorphism.
IfA, Bare bounded the above are further equivalent to:
(4) The maps H¯∂(f)andH∂(f)are isomorphisms.
Theorem C recovers partial results in the bounded case obtained by elemen-
tary methods in [Ste21] and puts them into a general algebraic context. It is a
main technical input for Theorems A and B, since HBCandHAare invariant by
conjugation and using them to characterize quasi-isomorphisms one can argue –
in principle – along the lines of the singly graded case, even though the technical
details, in particular for Theorem B, are still considerable. As an outgrowth of our
additive considerations, we prove several results that may be of independent inter-
est: A formula which exhibits Dolbeault, Bott-Chern, Aeppli and, more generally,
Schweitzer cohomology, as mapping spaces in Ho(BiCo) giving rise to a long exact
sequence in Schweitzer cohomology, and a Künneth type theorem for Aeppli- and
Bott Chern cohomology (Corollary 1.36).
The underlying idea of our main constructions is – perhaps deceptively – simple.
At the most elementary level it consists in replacing dby∂¯∂in all the ‘right’
places. In other words, one replaces ordinary potentials ( y=dx) by pluripotentials
(y=∂¯∂x). For example, in the singly graded theory, models are built by iteratively
building pushouts of diagrams
Λ(•) Λ(
)
M,
where •denotes a one-dimensional complex concentrated in a single degree and
an isomorphism d:C−→C. Depending on whether the vertical map sends the
generator of •to an exact element or not, this corresponds to adding a cohomology
class or enforcing a relation in cohomology. In perfect analogy, our constructions
will use successive pushouts of the form
Λ(•) Λ(□)
M,
where □denotes a four-dimensional bicomplex with ∂¯∂̸= 0(a square of four
one-dimensional spaces in neighbouring bidegrees, connected by isomorphisms) and
• →□istheinclusionidentifying •withthetoprightcorner, i.e. thesub-bicomplex
given by im∂¯∂.
Related works. The development of homotopical versions of the cohomolog-
ical story has been mostly focussed on the Kähler or algebraic case, see for in-
stance [Mor78], [Hai87a], [Hai87b], [NA87]. An exception is [NT78], where a ho-
motopical analogue of Dolbeault cohomology and the Frölicher spectral sequence
3is established for general complex manifolds, albeit at the cost of breaking the
inherent conjugation symmetry, see also [HT90]. In recent years, higher multiplica-
tive operations involving ‘double primitives’ (i.e. pluripotentials) have emerged
[AT15], [Ta17], [MS22], which can be nontrivial even on manifolds satisfying the
∂¯∂-property, [ST22], and which do not fit into the existing theories.
In the compact case, the theory developed here includes the Dolbeault coho-
motopy and Frölicher spectral sequence of [NT78], [HT90] and the induced filtra-
tions on the homotopy groups of compact Kähler manifolds obtained in [DGMS75],
[Mor78] via the principle of two types. It is also a natural framework for the
pluripotential higher operations, a point which is elaborated in detail in [MS22].
Sins of omission: From a purely algebraic standpoint, one could discuss many
results in a more general setup. For instance we always work over C, but all proofs
of results not concerning complex manifolds in sections 1, resp. 2 carry over to ar-
bitrary fields, resp. arbitrary fields of characteristic zero, and some can be adapted
for modules over more general rings. One can also consider n-gradings for n≥2.
Since our ultimate goal is to study complex manifolds we did not go down these
roads. For complex geometry itself, it will be very interesting to study the inter-
action of the bigraded invariants built here with the rational or integral structure.
Furthermore, one may now ask which results and techniques of rational homotopy
theory carry over to the holomorphic setting and which of the algebraic construc-
tions given here have ‘geometric’ counterparts, say in a suitable enlargement of the
category of complex manifolds. We leave this for future work. Finally, instead of
working with cbba’s as we do here, there is also a complementary operadic ap-
proach using bigraded homotopy transfer methods. This will be explored in the
forthcoming PhD thesis of Anna Sopena-Gilboy.

1.Direct sums and tensor products
1.1.The category of bicomplexes.
1.1.1.Basic definitions. We denote by BiCothe category of bicomplexes (or dou-
ble complexes) of C-vector spaces. Objects are bigraded C-vector spaces A=L
p,q∈ZAp,qtogether with an endomorphism dof total degree 1which splits into
components d=∂+¯∂of degrees (1,0)and(0,1)and satsifies d2= 0. Morphisms
areC-linear maps of the underlying vector spaces that preserve the bigrading and
commute with the differential. Even though we use the suggestive notation ∂,¯∂,
we do not in general assume bicomplexes to be equipped with a real structure in
the sense introduced below.
Thecategory BiCohas‘shift’endofunctors [r, s],definedby (A[r, s])p,q:=Ap−r,q−s

with differential
(1.1) d(ϕ):= (a7→[d, φ](a) =dφ(a)−(−1)|φ|φ(d(a))).

monoidal structure. In particular, internal hom and tensor product are adjoint so
that one has isomorphisms, natural in all entries
(1.2) (_⊗A):BiCo⇆BiCo :Hom(A,_)
For any finite dimensional bicomplex A, one has A∼=DDAand there is an identi-
fication of functors (DA⊗_)∼=Hom(A,_). Thus, from (1.2), in this case A⊗_
has a left-adjoint:
(1.3) (DA⊗_):BiCo⇆BiCo :(_⊗A)
1.1.2.Real structures. We denote by RBiCothe category of fixed points of the in-
volution σonBiCowhich maps a bicomplex Ato its complex conjugate bicomplex
¯A. The latter denotes the bicomplex which in degree (p, q)is the space Aq,pwith
the conjugate C-vector space structure and for which ∂and ¯∂are interchanged.
Objects of RBiCoare pairs (A, σ), where σ:A→¯Ais an isomorphism of bi-
complexes. Equivalently, we may consider σas aC-antilinear involution A→A
such that σ(Ap,q) =Aq,pandσ∂σ =¯∂. An object of RBiComay also be con-
sidered as an ordinary (cochain) complex over the reals together with a bicomplex
structure on its complexification, compatible with total grading and differential s.t.
the conjugation on the coefficients acts as above. For every complex manifold X,
the bicomplex of smooth, C-valued differential forms AX, with involution given by
complex conjugation, is an object in RBiCo. The discussion of shifts, duals etc.
has straightforward analogues for the category RBiCo. In fact, virtually all con-
structions made in this paper are either symmetric in ∂and¯∂or are easily adapted
to be and therefore extend to RBiCo.
1.1.3.Bicomplexes as modules. Following [KQ20], the category BiCocan also be
described as the category of bigraded modules over the bigraded algebra Λ(∂,¯∂) =
H∗(S1×S1;C), where we write ∂,¯∂for the fundamental classes of the two factors
and we consider the bigrading s.t. |∂|= (1,0)and|¯∂|= (0,1). As a bicomplex,
this algebra looks as follows:
⟨¯∂⟩ ⟨∂¯∂⟩
C ⟨∂⟩
where all arrows are isomorphisms. We will thus write symbolically □:= Λ( ∂,¯∂)
if we consider this algebra as an object in BiCo. Note that there is an antilinear
conjugation action exchanging ∂and¯∂and the category of equivariant modules for
this action is RBiCo.
1.1.4.Indecomposable bicomplexes. Recall that a bicomplex is called indecompos-
able if it cannot be decomposed into the direct sum of two nontrivial subcomplexes.
The indecomposable bicomplexes fall in two classes: Squares, i.e. bicomplexes iso-
morphic to □[p, q], for p, q∈Zand zigzags, which can formally be defined as
bicomplexes Zsuch every nonzero component has dimension 1and the undirected
support graph, with set of vertices {(p, q)|Zp,q̸= 0}and an edge between (p, q)
and(r, s)whenever there is a nonzero differential Zp,q→Zr,s, is homeomorphic to
a non-empty interval (with or without either endpoint). Since ∂2=¯∂2= [∂,¯∂] = 0,
any zigzag is concentrated in one or two total degrees. If a zigzag is bounded, it
has finite dimension, equal to the number of nonzero components, and we call this
dimension its length. Up to shift and isomorphism, the zigzags of length 1or2
6look as follows, where the superscript denotes the bidegree and all maps are the
identity:
C0,0,C0,0C1,0,C0,1
C0,0,C0,1
C0,0C1,0,C0,1C1,1
C1,0.
We will refer to these as dots and lines and (reverse) L’s. Up to isomorphism and
shift, there are two zigzags with any given length ≥2.
Theorem 1.1 ([KQ20],[Ste21]) .Any indecomposable bicomplex is a square or a
zigzag and any bicomplex is a direct sum of indecomposable subcomplexes. Such a
decomposition is unique up to (noncanonical) isomorphism and ordering.
Note that infinite dimensional zigzags will be unbounded in one or both anti-
diagonal directions.
Definition 1.2. A bicomplex is called locally bounded if it does not contain any
infinite-length zigzags as direct summands.
Forexample, firstquadrantcomplexes, i.e. Ap,q= 0whenever p <0orq <0, are
automatically locally bounded. By the usual construction of the spectral sequence
of a filtered complex applied to the row and column filtrations and a case by case
inspection as in [KQ20, p.14], we have
Lemma 1.3. For any bicomplex Athere are two ‘Frölicher’ spectral sequences with
row, resp. column cohomology as their first pages. They both converge to the total
cohomology if and only if Ais locally bounded.
Let us call a bicomplex minimal if ∂¯∂≡0. E.g., zigzags are minimal, but squares
are not. We note the following consequence of Theorem 1.1 for later use:
Corollary 1.4 (Minimal ⊕Contractible decomposition) .Any bicomplex Aadmits
a (noncanonical) decomposition A=Azig⊕Asq, where Asqis a direct sum of
squares and Azigsatisfies ∂¯∂≡0.
1.2.The homotopy category of bicomplexes. The algebra Λ(∂,¯∂)is a Frobe-
niusalgebraandassuchthecategoryofmodulesoveritisequippedwithacanonical
model category structure (c.f. [Hov99]) and the associated homotopy category is
a triangulated category as in [Hap88]. Without claiming any originality, in this
section we spell out these general results for the category of bicomplexes, following
[Hap88], [Hov99] and [KQ20].
Being the category of bigraded modules over a bigraded Frobenius algebra, pro-
jective objects in BiCocoincide with injective objects. In fact, projective objects
are precisely the direct sum of squares. The same holds in RBiCo, indecomposable
projective objects are direct sums of either conjugation invariant squares on the
diagonal or pairs of conjugate squares.
Let us say a map A→BinBiCois nullhomotopic if it factors through a
projective object and two maps f, gare homotopic f≃gif their difference f−gis
nullhomotopic. We denote the space of nullhomotopic maps between A, Bby
Hom0
BiCo(A, B):={f≃0} ⊆Hom BiCo(A, B)
The following Lemma shows how this notion is a bigraded version of the familiar
notion of chain homotopy, c.f. [KQ20].
Lemma 1.5. Letf:A→Bbe a map of bicomplexes. The following assertions
are equivalent:
(1)fis nullhomotopic.
7(2) There exists a map h:A→B[1,1]of bigraded vector spaces s.t. f=
[∂,[¯∂, h]] =∂¯∂h−∂h¯∂+¯∂h∂−h¯∂∂.1
Proof.Given any square Swith generator x, define a map k:=kS:S→S[1,1]
byk(∂¯∂x) =xandk(x) =k(∂x) =k(¯∂x) = 0. Denoting φk:= [∂,[¯∂, k]], we have
φk= Id S. This shows the statement is true for the identity map on a square, and
hence on any projective object. Next, assume we have a factorisation
f:Ai−→Pp−→B
with Pprojective and choose a map k:P→P[1,1]as above s.t. IdP= [∂,[¯∂, k]].
Then define h:=p◦k◦i.
Conversely, given h:A→B[1,1], setP:=□⊗A[−1,−1], whereweconsider □=
Λ(∂,¯∂)as a bicomplex as usual but consider A[−1,−1]with ∂=¯∂= 0. With this
definition, theinclusion i:A→Pdefinedby i(a) =∂¯∂⊗a−∂⊗¯∂a+¯∂⊗∂a−1⊗¯∂∂a
is a map of bicomplexes. Then, defining a map p:P→Bbyp:=m◦(Id⊗h)
where m:Λ(∂,¯∂)⊗B→Bis the module structure, we have f=p◦i. □
Remark 1.6. If in the previous Lemma fis a map in RBiCo, one may take hto
be purely imaginary (i.e. ¯h=−h).
We say a map f:A→Bis a bigraded chain homotopy equivalence if there
exists a map g:B→As.t.f◦g≃IdBandg◦f≃IdA. We will give further
characterisations of this property in Section 1.4 below.
Theorem 1.7. The category BiCo(resp. RBiCo) carries a cofibrantly generated
model category structure, where
(1) Fibrations are the surjective maps of bicomplexes.
(2) Weak equivalences are the bigraded chain homotopy equivalences.
(3) Cofibrations are the injective maps of bicomplexes.
Proof.This is (the bigraded version of) a special case of a general result on cate-
gories of modules over Frobenius algebras, see [Hov99]. □
Remark 1.8. In the literature one also finds model category structures on the
category of bicomplexes that use other notions of weak equivalences, e.g. maps
that induce isomorphisms in total cohomology or on some page of the spectral
sequences c.f. [MR18], [CESLW20]. As we see in Section 1.4, a bigraded chain
homotopy equivalence is a weak equivalence in all these other structures.
We denote by Ho(BiCo) the homotopy category of BiCo. Every object in BiCo
is both fibrant and cofibrant, and so one may compute the morphisms as homotopy
classes
(1.4) [A, B] =Hom BiCo(A, B)
Hom0
BiCo(A, B).
Again as a specialization of general results on stable categories [Hap88], [Cis10,
Prop. 4.19], Ho(BiCo) canbeequippedwiththestructureofatriangulatedcategory
as follows (c.f. also [KQ20]):
A shift functor BiCo→BiCo, which for reasons that will become obvious mo-
mentarily, we denote by L, is defined by L(A):=
⊗A, where
:=□[−1,−1]/⟨∂¯∂⟩=⟨¯∂⟩

⟨∂⟩
Lemma 1.9. InHo(BiCo) , there are natural identifications L◦L−1∼=Id. More
generally, the action of Lnis naturally identified with tensoring with a length 2|n|+1
zigzag.
Proof.The first part says the shift functor is an auto-equivalence, as is true in
any triangulated category. The more general statement is essentially proved in
[Ste21, §3], though without giving an explicit isomorphism, which can be easily
provided. In order not to get lost in notation, we give an example instead of a
general calculation: Considering
 ⊗
and writing x, yfor generators in bottom
left degree, we find that the subcomplex S⊆
⊗
generated (as a bicomplex) by
x⊗yis a square. Since injective-projective objects necessarily split off as direct
summands, the projection to the quotient is thus an isomorphism in Ho(BiCo) onto
a length five zigzag. Concretely:
⟨¯∂x⟩
⟨x⟩ ⟨∂x⟩⊗⟨¯∂y⟩
⟨y⟩ ⟨∂y⟩
=⟨¯∂(xy)⟩ ⟨∂¯∂(xy)⟩
⟨xy⟩ ⟨∂(xy)⟩⊕⟨¯∂x¯∂y⟩
⟨x¯∂y⟩ ⟨∂x¯∂y⟩
⟨∂xy⟩ ⟨∂x∂y⟩
□
We may define a cone functor by setting
cone( f:A→B):= coker( A→B⊕□[−1,−1]⊗A)
where the map is given by a7→(f(a), i∂¯∂⊗a). Explicitly, as a bigraded vector
space, wehaveanisomorphism cone( f)∼=B⊕L(A), withtheusualdifferentialon B
andd(1⊗a) =d⊗a+1⊗da,d(∂⊗a) =−f(ia)−∂⊗daandd(¯∂⊗a) =f(ia)−¯∂⊗da).
Finally, distinguished triangles are those isomorphic to
Af−→B−→cone( f)→L(A).
The tensor product and internal homs make BiCointo a symmetric monoidal
model category [Hov99, 4.2.15]. In particular, they induce well-defined functors on
the homotopy category and we still have adjunctions
(1.5) (_⊗A):Ho(BiCo) ⇆Ho(BiCo) :Hom(A,_)
and thus, for any Aisomorphic in Ho(BiCo) to a finite dimensional bicomplex:
(1.6) (DA⊗_):Ho(BiCo) ⇆Ho(BiCo) :(_⊗A)
and analogously for Ho(RBiCo).
91.3.Aeppli, Bott-Chern and Schweitzer cohomology as mapping spaces.
Recall that we have functors from bicomplexes to bigraded vector spaces given by
Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomologies
HBC:=ker∂∩ker¯∂
im∂¯∂HA:=ker∂¯∂
im∂+ im ¯∂.
IfAis a bicomplex, the bigrading HBC(A) =LHp,q
BC(A),HA(A) =LHp,q
A(A)is
simply induced by that of A.
Example 1.10. For bicomplexes A, B, there is a natural identification [A, B] =
H0,0
BC(Hom (A, B)). ThisfollowsfromEquation(1.4),Lemma1.5andEquation(1.1).
The Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomology groups are cohomology groups in par-
ticular degrees of a complex defined by M. Schweitzer and J. P. Demailly. More
precisely, for any bicomplex Aand a pair of integers p, q∈Z, define a complex

Write •for the double complex consisting of a single one-dimensional vector
space Cin degree (0,0). Then:
Theorem 1.11. There are natural isomorphisms
[•[p, q], A]∼=Hp,q
BC(A)and [
[p, q], A]∼=Hp−1,q−1
A (A)
and, more generally for any k∈Z,
[
⊗k[p, q], A]∼=Hp+q−k−1
Sp,q(A).
Proof.We have
[•[p, q], A] = Hom BiCo(•[p, q], A)/Hom0
BiCo(•[p, q], A).
Letx= 1[p, q]be the generator for •[p, q]. Then there is an isomorphism
Hom BiCo(•[p, q], A)∼=ker∂∩ker¯∂∩Ap,q
φ7→φ(x).
On the other hand, by Lemma 1.5, the set of null-homotopic morphisms is given
by the collection of φh= [∂,[¯∂, h]]forh:•[p, q]→Aa linear map of bidegree
(−1,−1). In that case, φh(x) =∂¯∂h(x), so that under the same identification
Hom0
BiCo(•[p, q], A)∼=im∂¯∂. This proves the first isomorphism. Note that we
could have also argued via Example 1.10.
For the second, we again denote by x= 1[p−1, q−1]a bicomplex generator of
[p, q], so that as a vector space
 [p, q] =⟨x, ∂x, ¯∂x⟩. As before, sending φ7→φ(x)
gives an identification of Hom BiCo(
[p, q], A)∼=ker∂¯∂∩Ap−1,q−1. On the other
hand, to give a linear map h:
[p, q]→Aof degree (−1,−1)it is necessary and

For the general formula, use Lemma 1.9 to replace
⊗kby an appropriate zigzag
of length 2|k|+ 1. Then the same arguments as above, with more cumbersome
notation, yield the conclusion. We omit the details. □
Corollary 1.12. For any triangle A→B→C→LAinHo(BiCo) , there is a
long exact sequence
(1.7) ...→Hp−1,q−1
A (C)→Hp,q
BC(A)→Hp,q
BC(B)→Hp,q
BC(C)
→Hp+q
Sp,q(A)→Hp+q
Sp,q(B)→Hp+q
Sp,q(C)→Hp+q+1
Sp,q(A)→ ···
Proof.By general properties of triangulated categories, there is a long exact se-
quence
(1.8) ...→[•[p, q], L−1(C)]→[•[p, q], A]→[•[p, q], B]
→[•[p, q], C]→[•[p, q], L(A)]→...
and this implies the statement using Theorem 1.11 and that for all bicomplexes
E, Fand integers r∈Zone has [E, Lr(F)] = [ L−r(E), F]by (1.6). □
Remark 1.13. Using the complex
 := (C→C)concentrated in degrees (0,0)
and(1,0), weseethat [
[p, q], A]∼=Hp,q
¯∂(A)andwerecoverthelongexactsequence
in column cohomology. Considering longer even length zigzags Zgoing from (0,0)
to(r,−r+ 1), there is a surjection [Z[p, q], A]→Ep,q
r(A), which is in general not
an isomorphism, as can be seen e.g. by taking Zto be length 4and computing
[Z,
 [1,−1]].
Remark 1.14. An elementary construction of the long exact sequence in Corol-
lary 1.12 is as follows: Assume the triangle A→B→C→LAis associated to
a short exact sequence 0→A→B→C→0of bicomplexes. The sequence of
simple complexes 0→ L p,q(A)→ L p,q(B)→ L p,q(C)→0is still exact and one can
consider its associated long exact sequence as usual.
Example 1.15. For any map f:X→Yof compact complex manifolds, one
obtains a triangle AY→AX→cone( f)→LAYinHo(BiCo) and a corresponding
long exact sequence in Schweitzer cohomology and Dolbeault cohomology. E.g. one
may apply this to submersions f:X→Yor embeddings i:Z→X, in which case
the cone is (up to shift) quasi-isomorphic to the relative forms AX/Y= coker f∗or
A(X, Z):= ker i∗.
To further illustrate the mapping-space long exact sequence in an abstract set-
ting, we apply it for a computation that will be used later on, in Section 2.6:
LetMbe a double complex and [c]∈Hp+1,q+1
BC (M)for some p, q∈Z. Define
M⊕c□[p, q]to be the pushout of the diagram
•[p+ 1, q+ 1] □[p, q]
M,
where the horizontal map sends the generator to the top right tip and the vertical
map sends the generator to c.
Lemma 1.16 (Bott-Chern-classes squared away I) .Write j=p+q. The coho-
mology M⊕c□[p, q]may be computed as follows:
11(1) If [c] = 0∈HBC(M), we have M⊕c□[p, q]∼=M⊕
[p+ 1, q+ 1]and so
Hi
BC(M⊕c□[p, q])∼=(

Hi
A(M⊕c□[p, q])∼=(

Hi
A(M)/[c]Aifi=j+ 2
Hi
A(M)else,
where Ris a vector space of dimension at most 2, which vanishes if [c]A̸= 0.
Proof.First assume c=∂¯∂band denote by aa generator for □, byxa generator
forL[p+ 1, q+ 1]. Then the isomorphism M⊕c□[p, q]∼=M⊕L[p+ 1, q+ 1]is
induced by the identity on Mandb7→a−x. The cohomology calculation is then
clear.
If[c]̸= 0, consider the short exact sequence
0→M→M⊕c□[p, q]→L[p+ 1, q+ 1]→0,
which has an associated long exact sequence. We write down the relevant portion,
where H=HBCorH=HA:
··· → Hi(•[p+1, q+1])→Hi(M)→Hi(M⊕c□[p, q])→Hi(
[p+1, q+1])→. . . ,
where we have used L−1(
[p+ 1, q+ 1]) = •[p+ 1, q+ 1]. The left map sends the
generatorto [c]. Further, wehave Hj+1
BC(
[p+1, q+1]) = C2,Hj
A(
[p+1, q+1]) = C
andHi(
[p+ 1, q+ 1]) = 0 else. It thus remains to analyze the right map in the
two cases where Hi(
[p+1, q+1])̸= 0. If[c]BC̸= 0, i.e. c̸∈im(∂¯∂), we see that it
is trivial when mapping to Hj
A(
[p+1, q+1])and under the additional assumption
that [c]A̸= 0, i.e. c̸∈(im∂+ im ¯∂), we see that it is trivial when mapping to
Hj+1
BC. □
Example 1.17. The following sketch illustrates a situation where dimR= 2. Dots
and diamonds stand for one-dimensional vector spaces and lines for isomorphisms.

It is an instructive exercise to draw similar pictures for situations with dimR= 1
ordimR= 0.
1.4.Pluripotential quasi-isomorphisms. We give a more in-depth study of
maps in BiCothat induce isomorphisms in Ho(BiCo) and prove Theorem C from
the introduction.
Lemma 1.18. LetAbe a bicomplex. The following statements are equivalent:
(1)A∼=0inHo(BiCo) .
(2)Ais a direct sum of squares.
(3)HBC(A) = 0.
(4)HA(A) = 0.
12IfAis locally bounded, these statements are further equivalent to:
(5)H∂(A) =H¯∂(A) = 0.
Proof.The equivalence of the first two statements follows from the definitions,
keeping in mind that projective objects are exactly direct sums of squares. To
show (2)⇔(3), (resp. (4)), use Theorem 1.1 and that HBC(resp. HA) commutes
with direct sums and check on every bicomplex separately. HBC(resp. HA) is
nonzero exactly on dots and corners of zigzags with incoming (resp. outgoing)
arrows. For the statement on row and column cohomology, note that these are
nonzero exactly on ‘endpoints’ of zigzags. □
Remark1.19. OnecanavoidusingthefullTheorem1.1andproveasin[DGMS75,
Prop. 5.17] by elementary means that under the assumption of, say, HBC(A) = 0,
one has a decomposition A=LSp,q, where Sp,qdenotes the subcomplex generated
by a complement of ker∂¯∂⊆Ap,q.
Remark 1.20. An unbounded projective Astill satisfies H∂(A) =H¯∂(A) = 0.
However, the converse is not true, as one can see by considering a two-sided infinite
zigzag.
Theorem 1.21. Letf:A→Bbe a map of bicomplexes. The following statements
are equivalent:
(1)fisa bigradedchain homotopyequivalence, i.e. anisomorphismin Ho(BiCo) .
(2)cone( f)is a direct sum of squares.
(3) For any choice of decomposition A=Asq⊕AzigandB=Bsq⊕Bzigas in
Corollary 1.4, the map f:Azig→Bzigis an isomorphism.
(4)HBC(f)andHA(f)are isomorphisms.
IfA, Bare locally bounded, these are further equivalent to H∂(f)andH¯∂(f)being
isomorphisms.
Definition 1.22. A map satisfying the above equivalent conditions will be called
apluripotential quasi-isomorphism or abigraded quasi-isomorphism .
We introduce two names for the same concept for the following reasons: The
term bigraded quasi-isomorphism is ambiguous since it could also refer to a map
of bicomplexes which is a usual quasi-isomorphism (i.e. it induces an isomorphism
in total cohomology). On the other hand, it has also been used with the current
meaning e.g. in [SW24], [MS22]. The term pluripotential quasi-isomorphism does
not have this ambiguity and conveys the crucial point of Theorem 1.21 (4) that
information on existence and uniqueness to the ∂¯∂-equation is preserved along
these quasi-isomorphisms. In this paper, we will use both terms interchangeably,
favouring ‘bigraded’ in the abstract algebraic setup and ‘pluripotential’ in context
of complex manifolds.
Proof.The equivalence of Item 1 and Item 2 is an instance of the following general
fact in triangulated categories that follows directly from the axioms: A map is an
isomorphism if and only if its cone isomorphic to zero. For the equivalence with
Item 3, note that Azig→AandB→Bzigare isomorphisms in Ho(BiCo) .
Next, consider the long exact sequence given by Corollary 1.12
(1.9) ...→Hp−1,q−1
A (A)→Hp−1,q−1
A (B)→Hp−1,q−1
A (cone( f))
→Hp,q
BC(A)→Hp,q
BC(B)→...
and using 1.18, we see that Item 1 is equivalent to Item 4.
The statement about row and column cohomology follows again using the asso-
ciated long exact sequences as in Remark 1.13 and Lemma 1.18. □
13Definition 1.23 ([Ste22a]).LetVbe an additive category. An additive functor
H:BiCo→Vis called cohomological if it satisfies H(P) = 0for any direct sum
of squares P.
Typical examples of such functors for us are HBC,HA,H¯∂, the Schweitzer coho-
mologies, etc. Additive functors commute with finite direct sums. If Hcommutes
even with infinite direct sums, it is enough to require H(□[p, q]) = 0forp, q∈Z.
In practice, all our examples will be of this form.
Remark 1.24. In [Ste22a], an additional finiteness condition and linearity instead
of additiveness were imposed, both of which are irrelevant here. In [Ste21] the
same notion appeared without name and with the inaccurate wording ‘ Hvanishes
on squares’ which should either be read as ‘ Hvanishes on direct sums of squares’ or
be complemented by the assumption that Hcommutes with arbitrary direct sums.
We recover the following result, proved in [Ste21] for bounded complexes by
different means.
Corollary 1.25. Letf:A→Bbe a map of bicomplexes s.t. HBC(f)andHA(f)
are isomorphisms. Then H(f)is an isomorphism for any cohomological functor.
IfA, Bare locally bounded, it suffices to require H∂(f)andH¯∂(f)to be isomor-
phisms.
Proof.It is enough to show that Hfactors through Ho(BiCo) . By the universal
property of localization this is the case if it sends bigraded homotopy equivalences
to isomorphisms in V. Since Hsends projective objects to zero it sends any map
factoring over projectives to zero. Then, for then for any bigraded homotopy equiv-
alence fwith quasi-inverse g, one has 0 =H(f◦g−Id) = H(f)H(g)−Idand
analogously H(g)H(f) = Id. □
Remark1.26 (Terminology) .In[Ste21]andfollowingworks,mapsbetweenbounded
complexessuchthat H∂(f)andH¯∂(f)areisomorphismswerecalled E1-isomorphisms.
In the context of triangulated categories, there is a different notion of cohomological
functor, namely an additive functor to an abelian category which sends triangles
to long exact sequences. This is a stronger condition than what is considered here,
where one only has that functor Hfactors through the (triangulated) homotopy
category, but no assumption about the behaviour on long exact sequences is made.
1.5.The real motives of complex manifolds. Given any complex manifold
X, the bicomplex AXdefines an object in RBiCo. One may think of the associ-
ated object in Ho(RBiCo)as the ‘real motive’ of X. In fact, by definition, any
cohomological functor factors through Ho(RBiCo)and, as we explain in this sec-
tion, analytically equivalent maps (resp. correspondences) define the same map in
Ho(RBiCo). This answers a question the author was asked by C. Deninger and S.
Boucksom (independently).
Lemma 1.27. LetX, Ybe compact connected complex manifolds. The following
maps are isomorphisms in Ho(RBiCo):
(1) (Künneth formula) AX⊗AY→AX×Y, given by ω⊗η7→pr∗
Xω∧pr∗
Yη.
(2) (Duality) AX→DAX, given by ω7→R
Xω∧_.
Proof.Both maps are compatible with the real structures. As noted in [Ste21],
they are E1-isomorphisms as a consequence of the Dolbeault Künneth formula,
resp. Serre duality [Se55]. Since all involved complexes are bounded, this means
they are also pluripotential quasi-isomorphisms by Theorem 1.21. □
Let us now assume Xto be compact and connected and let Cycp(X)denote
the free abelian group on closed irreducible, reduced complex analytic subspaces
14ofXof pure codimension p. We have a map Cycp(X)→(DnAX)p,pwhich sends
Z⊆Xto its current of integration [Z]:= (η7→R
Zη|Z)∈(DnAX)p,p. This current
is obviously ∂and ¯∂-closed and we can compose with a projection to obtain a
‘fundamental class’ map
Cycp(X)−→Hp,p
BC(DnAX)∼=Hp,p
BC(X)
Z7−→[Z].(1.10)
Assume we are given a compact connected complex manifold P, an analytic sub-
space W⊆X×Pof pure codimension pand two points a, b∈Ps.t. the fibres
Xa:=π−1
P(a),Xb:=π−1
P(b)of the projection πP:X×P→Pintersect W
transversally. Then Za:=W∩XaandZb:=W∩Xbare said to be elemen-
tary analytically equivalent. We denote by Cycp
0(X)⊆Cycp(X)the subgroup
generated by differences of elementary analytically equivalent cycles. Two cycles
Z, Z′∈Cycp(X)are said to be analytically equivalent if their difference lies in
Cycp
0(X). We call the quotient by this equivalence relation the analytic Chow
group: CHp
an(X):=Cycp(X)/∼an
Lemma 1.28. IfZ∼anZ′are two analytically equivalent cycles on X, their
fundamental classes coincide: [Z] = [Z′]∈HBC(X).
Proof.Without loss of generality, we can restrict to the case of elementary ana-
lytically equivalent subspaces, so let P, W, a, b, andZa, Zbbe as above. Note that
[a]−[b] = 0∈HdimP,dimP
BC (P). In fact, by duality it suffices to check this by pairing
with H0,0
A(P) =Cand for every constant function fone has f(a)−f(b) = 0. Then,
0 =i∗π∗([a]−[b]) = [ Za]−[Zb], where i:W→X×Pis the inclusion and we
have used that i∗([Xa]) = [ Za]andi∗([Xb]) = [ Zb](c.f. [Wu22], which contains an
argument even for integral Bott-Chern cohomology). □
Corollary 1.29. For any compact complex manifold X,(1.10)induces a well-
defined map CHp
an(X)→Hp,p
BC(X).
Corollary 1.30. For two compact complex manifolds X, Yof dimensions n, m,
there is a map
CHp
an(X×Y)−→[AY[p−m, p−m], AX].
Proof.This follows from the following chain of canonical identifications:
Hp,p
BC(X×Y)∼=[•[p, p], AX×Y]
∼=[•[p, p], AX⊗AY]
∼=[DAY[p, p], AX]
∼=[AY[p−m, p−m], AX].
Here, we have used Lemma 1.27 in the second and fourth line. The third line uses
(1.6), whichisapplicablesince AYisquasi-isomorphictoafinitedimensionalbicom-
plex by Theorem 1.1 and the fact that Dolbeault cohomology is finite dimensional
and nonzero on any bounded zigzag (c.f. [Ste21]). □
E.g. if f:X→Yis a map and Γf⊆X×Yits graph (so it has dimension
nand codimension p=m), one obtains a class in [AY, AX]which coincides with
the pullback map. In particular, analytically equivalent maps give rise to homo-
topic maps in BiCoand hence to the same pullback maps in every cohomological
functor. The above Corollary also shows that the same holds for maps induced by
correspondences.
151.6.ABC-cohomology and minimal models for bicomplexes. For any bi-
complex A, by Corollary 1.4 there is a decomposition A=Azig⊕Amininto a
minimal and a contractible part. Such a decomposition is a choice and generally
not compatible with maps. In this section we give a functorial meaning to the
summand Azig.
We note that the differentials ∂and¯∂induce maps of bidegree (1,0)and(0,1):
∂,¯∂:HA(A)−→HBC(A)
and the zero map on HBC. Thus, we can consider HA⊕HBCas a functor
bicomplexes −→minimal bicomplexes .
However, in general HA(A)⊕HBC(A)is not isomorphic to AinHo(BiCo) . For
instance, if A=Cis a dot, concentrated in a single bidegree, then
HA(A)⊕HBC(A) =C2̸=C=A
and the two sides can also not be isomorphic in Ho(BiCo) since they have different
cohomology. We will now present various ways to fix this ‘double counting’. For
this, it is convenient to introduce reduced versions of HAandHBC. Consider the
natural transformation induced by the identity
(1.11) HBC−→HA.
Now we define eHBC, resp. eHA, resp Hdotthe functors which send a bicomplex to
the (objectwise) kernel, resp. the cokernel, resp. the image of (1.11), which we may
describe explicitly as:
eHBC=im∂∩ker¯∂+ im ¯∂∩ker∂
im∂¯∂(1.12)
eHA=ker∂¯∂
im∂+ im ¯∂+ ker ∂∩ker¯∂(1.13)
Hdot=ker∂∩ker¯∂
im∂∩ker¯∂+ im ¯∂∩ker∂(1.14)
By definition, for any A∈BiCo, there is an exact sequence
0−→eHBC(A)−→HBC(A)−→HA(A)−→eHA(A)−→0,
and one checks that there are natural identifications
eHBC= im( HA⊕HA∂+¯∂−→HBC) (1.15)
Hdot= ker( HA(∂,¯∂)−→HBC⊕HBC). (1.16)
Definition 1.31. For any bicomplex A, the ABC-cohomology is the bicomplex
HABC(A):=HA(A)⊕eHBC(A)
and the BCA-cohomology is the bicomplex
HBCA(A):=HBC(A)⊕eHA(A).
For any bicomplex Awith ∂¯∂≡0, we have a short exact sequences
0−→HBC(A)−→A−→eHA(A)−→0, (1.17)
0−→eHBC(A)−→A−→HA(A)−→0. (1.18)
We note that ∂¯∂≡0onHABCandHBCA, so both constitute functors
bicomplexes −→minimal bicomplexes .
In fact, the result is quasi-isomorphic to A
16Proposition 1.32. For any bicomplex A, there are (non-canonical) isomorphisms
inHo(BiCo)
A∼=HABC(A)∼=HBCA(A).
Proof.One checks by an elementary computation that all expressions are zero on
squares and the identity on zigzags. The result then follows from Theorem 1.1. □
Remark 1.33 (Duality).For any bicomplex one has a canonical identification
HBCA(DA)∼=DHABC(A)and thus, by Lemma 1.27, for any compact complex n-
foldXthere are canonical isomorphisms Hp,q
BCA(X)∼=(Hn−p,n−q
ABC (X))∨. To obtain
a self-dual version, one may consider eHBC⊕Hdot⊕eHA.
1.7.Künneth formulae. For two bicomplexes A, B, there are natural maps
HBC(A)⊗HBC(B)−→HBC(A⊗B)
and
HBC(A)⊗HA(B)⊕HA(A)⊗HBC(B)−→HA(A⊗B).
Contrary to what one might guess, these are in general neither injective nor
surjective.
Example 1.34. IfA=L=⟨1, ∂,¯∂⟩,B=L−1=⟨∂,¯∂, ∂¯∂⟩, then Bott-Chern
cohomology of the tensor product A⊗Bis both one-dimensional and generated by
the class [¯∂⊗∂+ 1⊗∂¯∂+∂⊗¯∂]. On the other hand, HBC(A) =⟨[∂],[¯∂]⟩and
HBC(B) =⟨[∂¯∂]⟩and the first map is zero for bidegree reasons.
The Künneth formulae for Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomology will give explicit
expressions for the kernel and cokernel of these maps. Before going through the
somewhat technical statement and proof, here is the simple idea: If A=Azig⊕Asq
andB=Bzig⊕Bsqas in Corollary 1.4, then since the tensor product with a
contractible complex is contractible the zigzag part of A⊗Bcan be computed
from Azig⊗Bzig. Since the zigzag part can be unambiguously defined via ABC-
cohomology, we expect an formula of the form
HABC(X×Y)∼=HABC(HABC(X)⊗HABC(Y))
Since HABCis a sum of two components, this would split into two formulas, one
forHAand one for eHBC. The same comments apply to HBCA =HBC⊕eHA. We
will now unwrap the parts referring to HAandHBCand define explicit maps:
Theorem 1.35 (ABC Künneth formulae) .LetA, Bbe bounded bicomplexes.
(1) There is a natural short exact sequence
(1.19) 0−→HBC(A)⊗HBC(B)
∂¯∂(HA(A)⊗HA(B))−→HBC(A⊗B)−→K−→0
where Kis the following space
K:= (ker ∂∩ker¯∂)(eHA(A)⊗HBC(B)⊕HBC(A)⊗eHA(B))
(2) There is a natural short exact sequence
(1.20) 0−→L−→HA(A⊗B)−→(ker∂¯∂)(HA(A)⊗HA(B))−→0,
where
L:=eHBC(A)⊗HA(B)⊕HA(A)⊗eHBC(B)
∂(HA(A)⊗HA(B)) +¯∂(HA(A)⊗HA(B))
17Proof.Concerning (1.19), we define the left-hand map via
[a]BC⊗[b]BC7→[a⊗b]BC
and denote it by i. It is well-defined since, up to sign,
∂¯∂([c]A⊗[d]A) = [∂c]BC⊗[¯∂d]BC±[¯∂c]BC⊗[∂d]BC7→[∂¯∂(c⊗d)]BC= 0.
On the other hand, there is a natural homomorphism from p:K→coker( i)as
follows:
Consider a class c∈K. It can be written as
c=X
i[ai]˜A⊗[bi]BC+ [ci]BC⊗[di]˜A,
where we assume the individual factors to be of pure degree. The conditions ∂c= 0
translate into the existence of e∂
j, f∂
j, g∂
j, h∂
jof pure degree such that:
X
i∂ai⊗bi+ (−1)|ci|ci⊗∂di=X
∂¯∂e∂
j⊗f∂
j+g∂
j⊗∂¯∂h∂
j
and similarly e¯∂
k, f¯∂
k, g¯∂
k, h¯∂
ksatisfying the analogous equation with the roles of ∂and
¯∂reversed. We may then put
p(c):=[X
iai⊗bi+ci⊗di
−X
j(¯∂e∂
j⊗f∂
j+ (−1)|g∂
j|g∂
j⊗¯∂f∂
j)
+X
k(∂e¯∂
k⊗f¯∂
k+ (−1)|g¯∂
k|g¯∂
k⊗∂f¯∂
k)]
One verifies that this defines indeed a class in coker( i)which is independent of the
choices made and that the resulting map is a homomorphism. For example, if one
makes a different choice ˜e∂
j=e∂
j+e′with a ∂¯∂-closed element e′, the representative
forp(c)changes by ¯∂e′⊗f∂
j∈HBC(A)⊗HBC(B).
Now that the maps are in place, it remains to show injectivity of iand that p
is an isomorphism. For this, one may assume AandBindecomposable in which
case this is a straightforward calculation. We will only indicate the results for every
possible pair of indecomposable bicomplexes:
If either AorBis a square, all terms in the short exact sequence vanish, so there
is nothing to show. If Ais a dot and Ban arbitrary zigzag, then A⊗Bis a shifted
version of B, and ∂(HA(A)) = ¯∂(HA(A)) = 0so the denominator of the left hand
term and Kvanish and iis an isomorphism. Finally, assume A, Bare both zigzag
of length ≥2, concentrated in degrees k(A), k(A) + 1andk(B), k(B) + 1. Then
the tensor product A⊗Bis a bicomplex concentrated in degrees l, l+ 1, l+ 2with
l=k(A) +k(B). In degree l, all terms in (1.19) vanish. In degree l+ 1, the left
hand side vanishes and p:K→HBC(A⊗B)is an isomorphism (note also that
there is no choice involved in the definition of pin this total degree). Finally, in
degree l+ 2,K= 0andiis an isomorphism.
The proof for (1.20) is similar, but here the definition and well-definedness of the
maps is more immediately clear. Again one may verify exactness on a case-by-case
inspection of the combinations of indecomposable bicomplexes, which yields the
following results: For AorBa square, the whole sequence is zero. For Aa dot and
Bany zigzag, ∂HA(A) =¯∂HA(A) =eHBC(A) = 0so the left hand side vanishes
and the right hand map is an isomorphism HA(A⊗B)∼=HA(A)⊗HA(B). Now,
consider the case of both A, Bzigzags of length ≥2in degrees k(A), k(A) + 1,
resp. k(B), k(B) + 1, so that A⊗Bis concentrated in degrees l, l+ 1, l+ 2with
l=k(A) +k(B). All spaces in the sequence will be zero except possibly in degrees
18l, l+ 1. In degree l, the left hand side is zero and the right hand map is an
isomorphism. In degree l+ 1, the right hand side is zero and the left hand map is
an isomorphism. □
Corollary 1.36. LetX, Ybe compact complex manifolds and consider the projec-
tions prX,prYto both factors. Then there are short exact sequences
(1.21) 0−→HBC(X)⊗HBC(Y)
∂¯∂(HA(X)⊗HA(Y))pr∗
X×pr∗
Y−→ HBC(X×Y)−→K−→0,
and
(1.22) 0−→L−→HA(X×Y)−→(ker∂¯∂)(HA(X)⊗HA(Y))−→0,
where K, Lare defined as in Theorem 1.35.
Proof.This follows from Theorem 1.35, and Lemma 1.27. □
Let us specialize the Bott-Chern formula to the case of degrees (p,0), i.e. to
closed holomorphic forms. We then recover the following result:
Corollary 1.37. For compact complex manifolds X, Y, there are injections
M
a+b=pHa,0
BC(X)⊗Hb,0
BC(Y),→Hp,0
BC(X×Y)
for any given p∈Z.
Conjugation gives the analogous result in degrees (0, p). In degree (1,0), we
recover the following result, contained (without surjectivity in HA) in [CR22].
Corollary 1.38. For compact complex manifolds X, Y, there are isomorphisms
H0,1
BC(X)⊕H0,1
BC(Y)∼=H0,1
BC(X×Y)
and
H0,1
A(X)⊕H0,1
A(Y)∼=H0,1
A(X×Y)
Proof.Note that we have H0,0
BC(X) =C. Thus, if we restrict to degree (0,1), the
left hand side of (1.21) becomes H0,1
BC(X)⊕H0,1
BC(Y). On the other hand, we have
eH0,0
A(X) = 0and so
K= (ker ∂∩ker¯∂)(eH0,1
A(Y)⊕eH0,1
A(Y))
= (ker ∂∩ker¯∂)(eH0,1
A(Y))⊕(ker∂∩ker¯∂)(eH0,1
A(Y)) = 0 .
This shows the first isomorphism. For the second, we note that again because
eH0,0
A(X) = 0we have eH0,1
BC(X) =eH0,0
BC(X) = 0and so the left hand side of (1.22)
in degree (0,1)is zero. Since H0,0
BC(X)∼=H0,0
A(X) =Cthe right hand side is equal
toH0,1
A⊕H0,1
A. □
Remark 1.39. Another way of proving the Bott-Chern case of this Corollary is to
note that there is an isomorphism of holomorphic vector bundles p∗
XΩ1
X⊕p∗
YΩ1
Y∼=
Ω1
X×Yand hence an identification of global sections (holomorphic forms), which
restricts to an identification of the spaces of closed holomorphic forms. This gives
the result in degree (1,0), which, by conjugation, is equivalent to the statement in
degree (0,1).
The same kind of arguments show:
Corollary 1.40. IfX, Yare compact complex manifolds and Xsatisfies the ∂¯∂-
Lemma, the pullbacks p∗
X, p∗
Yinduce isomorphisms
HBC(X)⊗HBC(Y)∼=HBC(X×Y)
HA(X)⊗HA(Y)∼=HA(X×Y).
192.Wedge products
2.1.Commutative bigraded bidifferential algebras. By a (graded) commu-
tative bigraded bidifferential algebra (short: cbba) over C, we mean a bicomplex
(A·,·, ∂,¯∂)with the additional data of a product ∧:A×A→Aof bidegree (0,0)
and a unit C→Athat makes Ainto a unital graded-commutative algebra (with
respect to the total degree) and for which ∂and ¯∂satisfy the Leibniz-rule. We
denote the category of all cbba’s by CBBA.
2.1.1.Free-forgetful adjunctions. For any bicomplex B, we can form the free cbba
ΛBonB, i.e. the free bigraded graded-commutative algebra on Bas a vector
space, with differentials induced by those of B. Conversely, we have a forgetful
functor sending a cbba to its underlying bicomplex. These constructions give a
pair of adjoint functors
(2.1) Λ:BiCo⇆CBBA :U
We will also consider the category CBBA 0of augmented cbba’s, i.e. of pairs (A, ε)
where A∈CBBAandε:A→Cis a map in CBBA. For instance, for any
complex manifold Xand a point x∈X, the evaluation map εx:AX→Cis an
augmentation. Forany (A, ε)inCBBA 0,wedenoteby A+= ker εtheaugmentation
ideal. Note that a free cbba ΛBhas a canonical augmentation induced by B∋b7→
0. This yields an adjunction
(2.2) Λ:BiCo⇆CBBA 0:( )+.
Wewillfurtherconsiderthefullsubcategories CBBA≥0andCBBAf.q.ofalgebras
concentrated in nonnegative total degree, resp. the first quadrant, i.e. such that
Ap,q= 0whenever p+q <0(resp. Ap,q= 0forp <0orq <0). For any cbba A,
the complex conjugate ¯Aof the underlying bicomplex is again naturally a cbba and
a real structure on Ais aC-linear isomorphism σ:A∼=¯A. We denote the category
of pairs (A, σ)byRCBBAand the augmented version by RCBBA 0. There are
straightforward versions of the free-forgetful adjunction above for the categories
RBiCo⇆RCBBAand the bounded-below counterparts of the complex and real
categories.
2.1.2.Notions of connectedness. A cbba Ais called connected if it is concentrated
in non-negative total degrees and the unit C→A0is an isomorphism. It is called
simply connected if it is connected and A1= 0. For example, the free algebra on
a positively graded bicomplex is connected. Ais called cohomologically connected
ifH<0
A(A) = 0andC∼=H0(A). A compact complex manifold Xis connected iff
AXis cohomologically connected. Ais called cohomologically simply connected if
it is cohomologically connected and H1
A(A) = 0. A compact complex manifold Xis
calledholomorphicallysimplyconnectedif AXiscohomologicallysimplyconnected.
Using Theorem 1.1, one checks that for Xholomorphically simply connected one
hasH1
¯∂(X) = 0and, in particular, H1
dR(X) = 0.
2.2.A model category structure on CBBA.To define a model category struc-
ture on CBBA, we transfer the model category structure from BiCovia the ad-
junction in (2.1). More precisely, we claim to obtain a model category structure on
CBBAif we define a map of cbba’s to be
(1) a fibration if it is surjective,
(2) a weak equivalence if it is a bigraded quasi-isomorphism,
(3) a cofibration if it satisfies the left-lifting property with respect to all acyclic
fibrations.
20Recall that a fibration is said to be acyclic if it is also a weak equivalence and that
a map f:A→Bhas the left-lifting property with respect to a map p:C→Dif
for any commutative diagram of solid arrows
A C
B D,f pq
there exists a map q:B→Cmaking the two triangles commute.
Theorem 2.1. Defining the fibrations, weak equivalences and cofibrations as above
yields a model category structure on CBBA(resp. RCBBA).
Since for any model category, the category of objects with a map to some fixed
object has an induced model category structure, we immediately obtain:
Corollary 2.2. There are induced model category structures on the categories of
augmented cbba’s CBBA 0andRCBBA 0.
To explain the proof of Theorem 2.1, we first look at some particular examples
of cofibrations, which are the bigraded versions of Hirsch extensions (c.f. [GM13])
Definition 2.3. LetAbe a cbba. A (bigraded) Hirsch extension ofAis an
inclusion
A→A⊗ΛV
a7→a⊗1,
where V=Vk=L
p+q=kVp,qis a bigraded vector space concentrated in a single
total degree kand the bigraded algebra on the right is equipped with a differential
that makes the inclusion into a map of cbba’s and restricts to a linear map d:V→
kerd|Aof degree (1,0) + (0 ,1).
IfA∈RCBBAwas equipped with a real structure, by Hirsch extension we mean
the same as above, while also requiring that A⊗ΛVis equipped with an involution
extending that on Aand fixing V.
Lemma 2.4 (Hirsch extension lifting Lemma) .Hirsch extensions are cofibrations.
Proof.Consider a solid commutative diagram of cbba’s
A B
A⊗ΛV C˜fA
g
fAV
where A→A⊗ΛVis a Hirsch extension and g:B→Ca surjective bigraded quasi-
isomorphism. We need to show there exists a map ˜fAV:A⊗ΛV→Bextending
˜fAs.t.g◦˜fAV=fAV.
Note that it suffices to describe ˜fAVonV. To lighten up notation, let us assume
Vis one-dimensional and let v∈Vbe a basis element (in general, one should
take a basis (vi); which is furthermore stable under conjugation if one is working
inRCBBA). To define ˜fAVas an algebra map, we could simply pick arbitrary
preimages ˜vunder gfor the element fAV(v)and set ˜fAV(v) = ˜v. However, we
have ∂v,¯∂v, ∂ ¯∂v∈Aand so we have to respect the conditions ∂˜v=˜fA(∂v)and
¯∂˜v=˜fA(¯∂v).
In a first step, we will show that it is possible to pick preimages ˜v′offAV(v)
s.t. the weaker condition ∂¯∂˜v′=˜fA(∂¯∂v)is satisfied: Note that ∂˜fA(∂¯∂v) =
¯∂˜fA(∂¯∂v) = 0so that we get a well-defined class [˜fA(∂¯∂v)]∈HBC(B). Since
21g˜fA(∂¯∂v) =fAV(∂¯∂v) =∂¯∂fAV(v), this maps to the zero class in HBC(C). But
HBC(g)is injective, so we get some element b∈Bwith ∂¯∂b=˜fA(∂¯∂v). So
g(b)−fAV(v)maps to zero under ∂¯∂. Since gandHA(g)are surjective, this means
there is a ˜b∈Bwith ∂¯∂˜b= 0andg(˜b) =g(b)−fAV(v). Set ˜v′:=b−˜b.
Inanextstepwemodify ˜v′inasuchawaythatitsatisfiestheoriginalconditions.
Note that ∂˜v′−˜fA(∂v)lies in the kernel of ∂and¯∂and so defines a class in Bott-
Chern cohomology. This class maps to zero under gsince g(∂˜v′) = ∂g(˜v′) =
∂fAV(v) =g˜fA(∂v). Because HBC(g)is injective, this implies that there exists a
b∂∈Bs.t.∂¯∂b∂=∂˜v′−˜fA(∂v). By an analogous argument, we get a b¯∂∈B
s.t.∂¯∂b¯∂=¯∂˜v′−˜fA(∂v). Therefore, ˜v′′:= ˜v′−¯∂b∂+∂b¯∂satisfies ∂˜v′′=˜fA(∂v)
and ¯∂˜v′′=˜fA(¯∂v). It remains to fix its image under g. We do this as before:
g(˜v′′)−fAV(v)lies in the kernel of both ∂and¯∂and so defines a Bott-Chern class.
Since gandHBC(g)are surjective, we obtain a ˜b′∈Bs.t.∂˜b′=¯∂˜b′= 0and
g(˜b′) =g(˜v′′)−fAV(v). Defining ˜v= ˜v′′−˜b′, we are done. □
Remark 2.5. There seem to be no obstacles to developing the theory of Hirsch
extensions and obstruction cocycles to lifting in analogous fashion to [GM13, §10-
§11], using the bigraded mapping cone to define relative cohomology. Since for us
the above somewhat more elementary arguments suffice, we omit this.
We write S(p, q):= Λ(•[p, q])for the free algebra generated by a dot in degree
(p, q)andT(p, q):= Λ(□[p, q])for the free algebra generated by a square with base
in degree (p, q). This notation is a bit unfortunate for our purposes and will be
used in this section only, to ease comparison with [BG76].
Corollary 2.6. The following maps are cofibrations, i.e. they satisfy the left lifting
property with respect to surjective bigraded quasi-isomorphisms in CBBA.
(1) The inclusion S(p+ 1, q+ 1),→T(p, q).
(2) The inclusion C,→Λ(C)in degree (0,0), where Cis any bicomplex.
(3) coproducts, pushouts and (possibly transfinite) compositions of cofibrations.
Proof.(3) is a standard result about maps defined by having the lifting property
with respect to some class of maps, c.f. [BG76, 4.5.]. (1) is a direct consequence of
Lemma 2.4. For (2), first consider Cto be indecomposable. Then Cis concentrated
in finitely many (at most three) total degrees and so C,→Λ(C)can be written as
the composition of finitely many Hirsch extensions. The case of a general bicomplex
follows from Theorem 1.1 and (3). □
Proof of Theorem 2.1. With the results we have, the proof is very similar to the
singly graded case [BG76, §4], so we only indicate how to adapt the most interesting
axiom, namely that any map f:A→B, can be functorially factored as
f= (acyclic fibration )◦(cofibration )
Thiswilluseaslightlynon-obviouscharacterizationofweakequivalences(Lemma2.7
below). The proofs of the other axioms carry over immediately from [BG76]. We
will define the intermediate space as a colimit of a diagram
(2.3)A Lf(1) Lf(2) . . .
B.β1
fβ2
ψ1β3
ψ2
where each βiwill be a cofibration (hence also the colimit A→Lf:= colim Lf(n)).
Define Lf(1)as follows:
Lf(1):=A⊗O
b∈BhT(|b|)
22Here Bh=S
p,q∈ZBp,q⊆Bdenotes the set of elements of pure bidegree and for
b∈Bp,qwe write |b|= (p, q)for its bidegree. By construction, A→Lf(1)is a
cofibration as a coproduct of cofibrations and the map ψ1:Lf(1)→B, given by
the projection of the generators of T(|b|)tob, is surjective, hence a fibration.
With the higher Lf(i), we will make HA(ψ)surjective and kill the lack of in-
jectivity of HBC(ψ1). We construct them as follows: Given Lf(i), ψi, consider the
set
R:=
(w, b)∂1w=∂2w=0,
ψi(w)=∂¯∂b
|w|+(1,1)=|b|
⊆(Lf(i))h×Bh
and define (Lf(i+ 1), βi+1)as the pushout
N
(w,b)∈RS(|w|) Lf(i)
N
(w,b)∈RT(|b|) Lf(i+ 1).βi+1
Since the left-hand map is a cofibration as a coproduct of cofibrations, so is βi+1
and the universal property yields a map ψi+1:Lf(i+ 1)→B. By construction,
for any element [w]∈kerHBC(ψi), we have βi+1[w] = 0. Thus, ψ:= lim ψi:
Lf→Bis injective in HBC. Furthermore, already HA(ψ2), and hence HA(ψ), is
surjective (consider the pairs (0, b)∈R). That ψis acyclic now follows from the
next Lemma. □
Lemma 2.7. A map φ∈Map(BiCo)of bicomplexes s.t. HA(φ)is surjective and
HBC(φ)is injective is a bigraded quasi-isomorphism.
Proof.IfHA(φ)is surjective, also eHBC(φ)is surjective by (1.16). Then the result
follows by the four Lemma applied to the diagram
0→eHBC(φ)→HBC(φ)→HA(φ)→HBC(φ)⊕HBC(φ).
□
In particular, we obtain a cofibrant replacement functor (c.f. [Hov99, p.5]), i.e.
using the notation from the above proof:
Definition 2.8. For any cbba Awith unit ηA:C→A, thecofibrant replace-
mentisCA:=LηA.
The cofibrant replacement of a cbba is very big and we will be interested in
finding smaller cofibrant models. For now we introduce some language:
Definition 2.9. LetA∈CBBA 0be an augmented cbba.
(1)Ais called a nilpotent if it is a (possible transfinite) composition of Hirsch
extensions.
(2)Ais calledminimal , if it is nilpotent and im∂¯∂⊆A+A+.
(3) A weak equivalence M→A, where Mis a nilpotent algebra is called a
modelforA. IfMis minimal, it is called a minimal model .
We note that an augmented cbba Ais nilpotent iff there is a presentation as a
free commutative bigraded algebra A= ΛVwith a well-ordered basis {vi}i∈Ifor
the space of generators Vsuch that dvi∈Λ(span {vj|j < i}). Furthermore, a
nilpotent cbba is minimal iff the bicomplex of indecomposables A+/A+A+, with
induced differentials, is minimal. Again, there are obvious real versions of these
definitions. By Lemma 2.4 and Corollary 2.6, we obtain:
Corollary 2.10 (Lifting Lemma) .Nilpotent cbba’s are cofibrant in CBBA 0.
23Remark 2.11 (Bounded variants) .The same kind of constructions used to prove
Theorem 2.1 allow one to transfer the model category structures from the non-
negatively graded, resp. first quadrant, subcategories of BiCotoCBBA≥0, resp.
CBBAf.q., andthecorrespondingrealversions. Namely, onedefinesagainfibrations
to be surjective maps, weak equivalences to be bigraded quasi-isomorphisms and
cofibrations via the left-lifting property. The reader will have no trouble to verify
that the augmentation maps Λ(•[p, q])→Care cofibrations in CBBA≥0for0≤
p+q≤1and cofibrations in CBBAf.q.whenever p+q≥0andp= 0orq= 0.
Consequently, one may put T(p, q):=Cin those bidegrees and run the same proof
as above for the construction of fibration-cofibration factorizations.
2.3.Homotopy for cbba’s and complex manifolds. We will define and study
various ‘holomorphic’ variants of the homotopy groups.
We start by describing a functorial path object, i.e. a functorial factorization of
the maps A→A×Ainto an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration.
Definition 2.12. We denote by Ω1
big:= Λ⟨t, ∂t, ¯∂t, ∂¯∂t⟩, where |t|= (0,0).
Lemma 2.13. The inclusion C→Ω1
bigis a bigraded quasi-isomorphism.
Proof.Note that Ω1
bigis nothing but the free algebra on a square Λ(□), which is a
direct summand in the tensor algebra over □which is contractible since nontrivial
tensor products of projective objects are projective. □
Remark 2.14. Alternatively, it follows from 0≃□inBiCousing that Λas a part
of a Quillen adjunction (2.1) preserves weak equivalences. Of course, it can also be
seen by a direct calculation, see Example 2.33, which could be used to define an
‘integration’ operator on Ω1
big.
There are evaluation maps εs:Ω1
big→C, given by sending t→sand every
other generator to 0. Since C→Ω1
bigis a weak equivalence, so is A→Ω1
big⊗A
for any A∈CBBA. Further, for the map (ε0, ε1):Ω1
big⊗A→A×Ais always a
fibration (i.e. surjective): A preimage for (a, b)∈A×Ais given by (1−t)a+tb.
Thus, we have shown:
Lemma 2.15. The association A→Ω1
big⊗Ais a functorial path object in CBBA.
We therefore say that two maps f, g:A→BinCBBAare (right) homotopic if
there exists a map H:A→Ω1
big⊗Bs.t.ε0⊗Id = fandε1⊗Id = g. We denote the
relation of homotopy by f∼g. Since all objects in CBBAare fibrant, homotopy
is an equivalence relation (see e.g. [Hov99, Prop. 1.2.5]). If Ais cofibrant, there is
an identification
[A, B]∼=Hom CBBA (A, B)/∼,
where ∼denotes the relation of homotopy and we write [A, B]for the set of maps in
Ho(CBBA) . If we need to distinguish [A, B]from the set of morphisms in Ho(BiCo)
between the underlying bicomplexes, we will write [A, B]CBBAand[A, B]BiCo =
[UA, UB ]BiCo.
InCBBA 0, a functorial path object is given by A7→Ω1
big˜⊗A, where
Ω1
big˜⊗A:=C⊕Ω1
big⊗A+
with augmentation given by projection to the first summand. The corresponding
notion of homotopy in CBBA 0is given by a map H:A→Ω1
big˜⊗B. Further, we
may consider Ω1
bigas an object of RCBBA, by equipping it with the antilinear
involution σmapping σ(t) =t,σ(∂t) = ¯∂tandσ(∂¯∂t) =−∂¯∂t. The previous
discussion applies, mutatis mutandis, to CBBA 0,RCBBA,RCBBA 0and their
bounded below counterparts.
24Because of the adjunctions (2.1) and (2.2), and the definition of the model struc-
ture on CBBA, resp. CBBA 0as a transferred model structure, we obtain induced
derived functors [Hov99, 1.3.7]
Ho(CBBA) →Ho(BiCo)
Ho(CBBA 0)→Ho(BiCo)
We now look at these more closely. The proof of the following two Lemmas is
similar to the singly graded case:
Lemma 2.16. For two homotopic maps f∼g:A→BinCBBA(resp. CBBA 0),
the underlying maps f, g:UA→UB(resp. f+, g+:A+→B+) are homotopic in
BiCo. In particular, H(f) =H(g)for any cohomological functor H.
Proof.Considerahomotopy H:A→Ω1
big⊗Bbetween fandg. Thedecomposition
Ω1
big=C⊕(Ω1
big)+induces a decomposition Ω1
big⊗B=B⊕(Ω1
big)+⊗Band since
ε0=ε1on the first summand, f−gfactors through the second summand. However,
(Ω1
big)+is contractible (a direct sum of squares) and hence so is (Ω1
big)+⊗B. The
argument for the augmented case is analogous. □
For any augmented cbba (A, ε), denote by QA:=Q(A, ε):=A+/A+A+the
space of indecomposables. With the induced differentials, (QA, ∂, ¯∂)is a bicomplex.
Further:
Lemma 2.17. The assignment A7→QAdefines a functor CBBA 0→BiCowhich
sends augmentedly homotopic maps of augmented cbba’s to homotopic maps of bi-
complexes.
Proof.LetH:A→Ω1
big˜⊗Ban augmented homotopy between two maps f, g:
A→B. Note that
Q(Ω1
big˜⊗B) = Ω1
big⊗QB
and hence we may argue as in the proof of Lemma 2.16. □
Denoting by Cthe cofibrant replacement functor in CBBA 0, we define:
Definition 2.18. Thehomotopy bicomplex of an augmented cbba (A, ε)is
given by π(A, ε):= (QCA, ∂, ¯∂).
By Lemma 2.17, the homotopy bicomplex defines a functor
π:Ho(CBBA 0)→Ho(BiCo)
resp, taking real structures into account,
π:Ho(RCBBA 0)→Ho(RBiCo) .
Wemaypostcompose πwithanycohomologicalfunctorandobtaina(co-)homotopy
version, e.g.
πp,q
¯∂(A, ε):=Hp,q
¯∂(π(A, ε))
πp,q
∂(A, ε):=Hp,q
∂(π(A, ε))
πk
dR(A, ε):=Hk
dR(π(A, ε))
πp,q
BC(A, ε):=Hp,q
¯∂(π(A, ε))
πp,q
A(A, ε):=Hp,q
A(π(A, ε))
and, generalizing the last two, πk
Sp,q(A, ε):=Hk
Sp,q(π(A, ε))andπABC(A, ε):=
HABC(π(A, ε)),πBCA(A, ε):=HBCA(π(A, ε)). IfA= (AX, εx)for some pointed
complexmanifold (X, x),wewrite π(X, x):=π(AX, εx),πp,q
¯∂(X, x):=πp,q
¯∂(AX, εx),
etc.
25Remark 2.19. As for any bicomplex, by Theorem 1.1 the isomorphism type of
π(A, ε)inHo(BiCo) is determined by the multiplicities of all zigzags, or also by the
minimal bicomplex πABC(A, ε).
For any cohomological functor Hto some C-linear category Cwith an antilinear
involution τ, which is equivariant with respect to that involution H(¯A) =τH, one
obtains an induced functor on the categories of fixed points. In particular, one has
an induced real structure on π·,·BC(X, x), π·,·A(X, x)etc.
We now make the relation to usual homotopy precise:
Proposition 2.20. For any connected complex manifold Xwhich has a nilpotent,
finite-type underlying topological space, whenever πk(X, x)is abelian, there is an
identification
πk
dR(X, x)∨∼=πk(X, x)⊗C,
compatible with the real structures on both sides.
The commutativity assumption is to avoid technicalities: For a general nilpotent
space, one should replace π1(X, x)⊗Cby its complexified Mal’cev Lie-algebra, see
[BG76].
Proof.The fundamental theorem of rational homotopy theory yields a natural iso-
morphism
πk(X, x)⊗Q∼=[APL(X), APL(Sk)]cdga≥0
Q,0,
where cdga≥0
Q,0denotes the category of augmented rational cdga’s concentrated
in non-negative degrees with the transfered model structure from bounded-below
cochain complexes and APLthe piecewise-linear forms. As noted in [LM15], if we
denote cdgaQ,0the model category structure of augmented rational Z-graded cdga’s
without degree restrictions, we have an identification
[APL(X), APL(Sk)]cdga≥0
Q,0∼=[APL(X), APL(Sk)]cdgaQ,0,
because APL(X)is cohomologically connected (and so admits a minimal model,
which is cofibrant in both categories). Furthermore, Skis formal and the de Rham
theorem gives an chain of quasi isomorphisms connecting APL(X)⊗Cwith AX.
We thus have:
πk(X, x)⊗C∼=[AX, H·(Sk,C)]cdgaC,0
∼=[CAX, H·(Sk,C)]cdgaC,0
∼=πk
dR(X, x)∨
where CAXdenotes the cofibrant replacement in CBBA 0, which, being a compo-
sition of Hirsch extensions, is also cofibrant in cdgaC,0. The last equality follows
from [BG76, 6.12 and 6.16].2□
Note that as for any bicomplex, there are the row and column filtrations F,¯F
onπ(A). These induce spectral sequences and filtrations on the total cohomology,
which we still denote by F,¯F.
Corollary 2.21. For any complex manifold X, there are two conjugate filtrations
onπk
dR(X), which we call the Hodge filtrations. Furthermore, there are two conju-
gate spectral sequences with the first page π¯∂(X), resp. π∂(X).
2The proof there is for non-negatively graded cdga’s, but the argument is the same when
considering all cdga’s.
26Remark 2.22 (Convergence of the spectral sequences) .The spectral sequences
starting with π¯∂(X, x)andπ∂(X, x)converge to πdR(X, x)with its column, resp.
row Hodge filtration if and only if π(X, x)is locally bounded, see Lemma 1.3. Note
that this does only depend on the isomorphism class of π(X, x)inHo(BiCo) . In
particular, this is the case if there is a model for which all generators lie in a strictly
convex region of the positive-degree half-plane. As we will see later on, this is the
case for holomorphically simply connected manifolds or nilmanifolds.
If one works with the model category structure on CBBAf.q.instead as sketched
in Remark 2.11, one always obtains strong convergence, but the relation of the
target to the usual homotopy groups is less clear.
Remark 2.23 (Diagrams) .One can also consider cohomological functors not land-
ing in (bigraded) vector spaces but rather in categories of diagrams. For instance,
the above constructions fit together to form a natural diagram
πp,q
BC(X, x)
πp,q
¯∂(X, x) πp+q
dR(X, x) πp,q
∂(X, x).
πA(X, x)
and one has the same maps between Schweitzer and de Rham, resp. Dolbeault
cohomotopy as one for the respective cohomologies, e.g. there are maps πk
Sp,q(X)→
πk+1
dR(X)fork≥p+q−1etc.
We now give an interpretation of various complex homotopy groups as spaces of
maps in Ho(CBBA 0). This is a bigraded analogue of the aforementioned [BG76,
6.12 and 6.16] used at the end of the proof of Proposition 2.20. For any bicomplex
C, define S(C):= Λ( C)/Λ(C)+Λ(C)+, i.e. make every product of two non-units
trivial. For indecomposable, non-contractible C, the S(C)may be considered as
naive bigraded analogues of spheres. Then we have:
Lemma 2.24. For any augmented cbba A, there is an identification
[A, S(C)]CBBA 0∼=[π(A), C]BiCo.
Proof.Note that π(S(C)) = C, so the map is induced by applying the functor π.
Without loss of generality, we may assume Ato be cofibrant with π(A) =QAand
[A, S(C)]BiCo 0= Hom CBBA 0(A, S(C))/∼.
We may also assume that A=A/A+A+, and hence QA=A+. Surjectivity is
then clear. For injectivity, assume we have two augmented maps f, g:A→S(C)
such that f+∼g+:A+→CinBiCovia a linear homotopy h:A→C[1,1]s.t.
f+−g+= [∂,[¯∂, h]]. Now define an augmentation preserving map A→Ω1
big˜⊗S(C)
by setting for any a∈A+:
H(a):= (1−t)⊗f+a+t⊗g+a+∂t⊗[¯∂, h]a−¯∂t⊗[∂, h]a+∂¯∂t⊗ha
Then, sorting by terms, we have:
∂H(a)−H(∂a) = ∂t⊗(g+a−f+a−[∂,[¯∂, h]]a) +
¯∂t⊗[∂,[∂, h]]a+
∂¯∂t⊗(−[∂, h]a+∂ha−h∂a)
= 0 .

Remark 2.25. If both sides are equipped with real structures and his imaginary,
Hin the above proof is real, so the result remains valid in RCBBA 0.
Corollary 2.26. LetAbe an augmented cbba. Then there are natural identifica-
tions

where we have used the adjunctions (1.5) and (1.6) and Remark 1.13. □
2.3.1.Comparison with existing complex cohomotopy theories. Let us compare the
resultingnotionsofcohomotopygroupswiththosearisingfromexistingtheories. To
avoid an overly technical discussion, we will assume AXis cohomologically simply
connected. ByTheorem2.34below, itthenhasasimplyconnectedrealcbbamodel.
In [NT78], the authors develop a Dolbeault cohomotopy theory by considering
‘differential bigraded algebra (DBA)’ models (ΛV·,·NT,¯∂)→(AX,¯∂), i.e. ΛVNTis
a free bigraded algebra with generators in non-negative total degree, ¯∂is a differ-
ential of type (0,1)that turns ΛVinto a nilpotent cdga and the map is a quasi-
isomorphism in H¯∂. The cohomology of the complex of indecomposables (VNT,¯∂0)
defines Dolbeaultcohomotopy groups. Forgetting the ∂-differential, aminimal cbba
model for AXis DBA-model in the sense of [NT78] and so the Dolbeault cohomo-
topy groups of [NT78] and Corollary 2.21 agree.
By[HT90,Thm. 4.2.],everyfilteredcdga (A, F)withacomplete( A∼=lim← −A/Fp)
and cocomplete ( lim− →F−p∼=A) filtration admits a filtered (again complete and co-
complete) model φHT:(ΛVHT, F)→(A, F)in the sense that φHTinduces an
isomorphism on the first page of the spectral sequence associated with the filtra-
tion. Under the completeness assumption, this implies that φHTis also a de Rham
model. Such a model is obtained by perturbing the differential of a bigraded cdga
model for the first page of the spectral sequence. It is unique up to filtered homo-
topy equivalence [HT90, Thm. 8.1.]. The complex of indecomposables thus carries
a filtration, giving rise to a spectral sequence and filtrations on the de Rham co-
homotopy. Again, a minimal cbba model for AXis a filtered model in the sense of
[HT90] and so the induced filtrations on the cohomotopy groups agree.
WenotethataFrölichercohomotopysequencewasalreadyconstructedin[NT78]
wheretheexistenceoffilteredmodelsisalreadyclaimedwithashortproofin[NT78,
Prop. 1], but we were not able to follow the argument [NT78] that the map from
the model is filtration preserving. A second proof is given in [NT78, Thm. 1],
which contains a claim that a Dolbeault quasi-isomorphism of cbba’s is also a de
Rham quasi isomorphism, which is false without completeness assumptions as we
illustrate in Example 3.12 below. At any rate, these issues seem minor and one
could use the results of [HT90] instead.
28For compact Kähler manifolds, Morgan constructs a minimal cdga ΛVwith two
filtrations F,¯Fand two homotopic maps ρ, ρ′:ΛV→AXsuch that (ΛV, F, ρ )is
a filtered model for (AX, F)and(ΛV,¯F, ρ′)is a filtered model for (AX,¯F)in the
sense of [HT90]. In particular, the induced filtrations on the homotopy groups are
again identified with those of Corollary 2.21.
Finally, Morgan’s theory was recast in a more functorial way in [Cir15] which
compares well with the present approach: Denote by RCBBA′
0the full subcategory
ofRCBBA 0consisting of cohomologically simply connected first quadrant cbba’s
which satisfy the ∂¯∂-Lemma (i.e. their underlying bicomplex is a direct sum of
dots and squares). Denote by MHD1
∗the category of augmented 1-connected
Mixed Hodge diagrams as in [Mor78, Def. 3.5.], [Cir15]. We obtain a functor
Ψ:RCBBA′
0→MHD1
∗as follows: For any (A, σ)inRCBBA′, we obtain a real
Mixed Hodge diagram (c.f. [Mor78, Def. 3.5.]) Ψ(A):= ((A′, W),(A, W, F ), ι),
where A′:=Aσ=Id, the filtration Wdenotes in both cases the trivial filtration with
only jump in degree 0,Fdenotes the column filtration and ι:A′⊗RC∼=Ais the
tautological isomorphism. We obtain an induced commutative diagram
Ho(RCBBA′
0) Ho(MHD1
∗)
Ho(RBiCo) Ho(MHC ),Ψ
π π
Ψ
where MHCdenotesthecategoryofrealMixedHodgecomplexes[Del74], πdenotes
the derived functorof indecomposables constructed inDefinition 2.18, resp. [Cir15],
and we keep denoting Ψthe analogous functor on bicomplexes.
Remark 2.27. Note that the models in [DGMS75], [NT78] and [HT90] are all
bigraded, but they are not cbba models in the sense of this article: In fact, the
bigrading in [DGMS75] is such that dis of total degree 0and the models in [NT78]
are not compatible with the real structure, nor are they generally de Rham models,
as we illustrate in Example 3.12 below. The models in [HT90] are de Rham models
but they similarly do not see the real structure and the differential will generally
not be of bidegree (1,0) + (0 ,1)but have more components.
2.4.Minimal models: uniqueness. Our first goal will be to show that, just
as in the singly graded case [BG76, 7.6., 7.8], minimal models are unique up to
isomorphism.
Theorem 2.28. Any weak equivalence between two connected minimal cbba’s is an
actual isomorphism.
Proof.LetA, Bbe minimal. Since A, Bare both fibrant and cofibrant, a map
f:A→Bis a weak equivalence if and only if it is a homotopy equivalence. Thus,
assuming ftobeaweakequivalence, wemaypicka g:B→Asuchthat f◦g≃IdB
andg◦f≃IdA. In particular, πABC(f)andπABC(g)are inverse isomorphisms.
Given any presentation A= ΛVAas a free algebra with VA=V≥1
A, we may identify
VA∼=QA. Since ∂¯∂= 0onQA, by (1.18), there is a short exact sequence
0→eπBC(A)→VA→πA(A)→0.
Hence, by the Five-Lemma, the induced map Q(g◦f):QA→QAis an isomor-
phism, and then so are all the maps (A+)n/(A+)n+1→(A+)n/(A+)n+1. Since Ais
connected, all generators lie in positive degrees and so, we have (A+)n∩Am={0}
forn≫m. Applying the Five-Lemma repeatedly (but finitely many times in every
29degree) to the diagrams
0 (A+)n/(A+)n+1A+/(A+)n+1A+/(A+)n0
0 (A+)n/(A+)n+1A+/(A+)n+1A+/(A+)n0
we conclude that f◦g:A+∼=A+is an isomorphism, hence also f◦g:A∼=Ais
an isomorphism, again by the Five Lemma applied to the augmentation sequence.
Arguing analogously for f◦g, we find that fandgmust be isomorphisms. □
Corollary 2.29 (Uniqueness of connected minimal models) .Any two connected
minimal models for a cbba Aare isomorphic (over A).
Proof.Given φ:M→Aandφ′:N→Atwo positively generated minimal models
foracbba A, bytheliftingLemma2.10, weobtainamap f:M→Ns.t.φ′◦f∼φ.
Since φ, φ′are weak equivalences, so is fand we conclude by Theorem 2.28. □
2.5.Technical preparations. The following Lemmas will be the main technical
ingredients in the proof of the existence of minimal models for simply connected
cbba’s. The key point is that we need to ‘kill’ redundant classes in Bott-Chern
cohomology while controlling the rest of the cohomology and keeping the algebra
minimal. For this, we have to investigate more closely than before the kind of
extensions that remove the Bott-Chern classes.
For any cbba Mandc∈Ma pure bidegree element s.t. ∂c=¯∂c= 0, denote by
Mc:=M⊗cΛ(□)the pushout of the following diagram:
Λ(•[|c|]) Λ(□)
M
where the horizontal map is induced by inclusion into the top corner.
Lemma 2.30 (Bott-Chern-classes squared away II) .LetM= ΛVbe a cbba which
as an algebra is freely generated in degrees 2≤j≤k+1s.t.(dV)k+2= (∂¯∂V)k+2=
0. Let c∈Mbe a pure bidegree element s.t. ∂c=¯∂c= 0. Then, the cohomology
ofMccan be expressed in terms of the inclusion i:M ,→Mc, as follows:
(1) If |c|=kand[c]A̸= 0, then iinduces an isomorphism
H<k
A(M)∼=H<k
A(Mc), H<k
BC(M)∼=H<k
BC(Mc)
and a short exact sequence
0−→ ⟨ [c]⟩ −→ Hk
BC(M)i∗−→Hk
BC(Mc)−→0
(2) If cis as in(1)and indecomposable, ifurther induces an isomorphism
Hk+1
BC(M)∼=Hk+1
BC(Mc)
and a short exact sequence
0−→ ⟨ [c]A⟩ −→ Hk
A(M)−→Hk
A(Mc)−→0.
(3) If 0̸= [c]∈eHk+1
BC(M),iinduces isomorphisms

BC(M)−→Hk+1
BC(Mc)−→0,
where Risa vectorspace ofdimensionat most 2. Any subspace of Hk
BC(Mc)
that maps isomorphically to Ris necessarily indecomposable.
Recall that an element of an augmented cbba a∈A+is called indecomposable if
its projection onto the indecomposables is nonzero: 0̸= pr( a)∈QA=A+/A+A+.
Analogously, we say a subspace W⊆A+is indecomposable if its projection onto
QAis injective.
For the proof of Lemma 2.30, it will be convenient to consider the following
truncations of a bicomplex:
Definition 2.31. For any bicomplex Aandk∈Z, we define truncated subcom-
plexes τkA⊆Aby
(τkA)j:=

0 ifj > k + 1
(ker∂∩ker¯∂)k+1ifj=k+ 1
(ker∂¯∂)kifj=k
Ajifj≤k−1.
One checks that
Hj
BC(τkA) =(
0 ifj > k + 1
Hj
BC(A)ifj≤k+ 1,Hj
A(τkA) =

0 ifj > k + 1
Hk+1
dot(A)ifj=k+ 1
Hj
A(A)ifj≤k.
Proof of Lemma 2.30. In all cases, let us denote by pa generator for the bottom
left space of the generating square in Λ(□)s.t.∂¯∂p=cinMc.
For (1), we consider the truncation τk−1Mc. It is described as follows:
(τk−1Mc)j=

0 ifj > k
(τk−1M)kifj=k
(τk−1M)k−1⊕ ⟨∂p,¯∂p⟩ifj=k−1
Mk−2⊕ ⟨p⟩ ifj=k−2
Mjifj≤k−3.
I.e.τk−1Mc=τk−1M⊕c□and the result follows from Lemma 1.16.
For (2), we consider the filtration τkMc. It is described as follows
(τkMc)j=

0 ifj > k + 1
(ker∂∩ker¯∂)∩(Mk+1⊕(V2⊗ ⟨∂p,¯∂p⟩)⊕(V3⊗ ⟨p⟩))ifj=k+ 1
(ker∂¯∂)∩(Mk⊕(V2⊗ ⟨p⟩)) ifj=k
Mk−1⊕ ⟨∂p,¯∂p⟩ ifj=k−1
Mk−2⊕ ⟨p⟩ ifj=k−2
Mjifj≤k−3.
Let us describe the first two expressions in terms of τkM. Consider an element
e∈(τkMc)k+1and write it as
e=m+v′⊗∂p+v′′⊗¯∂p+v⊗p,
with v∈V3,v′, v′′∈V2andm∈M. Then
0 =∂e= (∂m±v′′∧c) + (∂v′∓v)⊗∂p+∂v′′⊗¯∂p+∂v⊗p
31and so in particular ∂v′∓v=∂m±v′′c= 0. By the same equation for ¯∂, we obtain
¯∂v′′∓v=¯∂m±v′c= 0. Since no generatorhas differential in degree k+2, any exact
element in degree k+ 2has to be a sum of products of at least three generators.
Since cis indecomposable, this implies v′c=v′′c= 0and so v′=v′′= 0. But
then also v= 0. We have shown (τkMc)k+1= (τkM)k+1. In degree k, we argue
similarly: For any v∈V2, we have
(2.4) ∂¯∂(v⊗p) =∂¯∂v⊗p+∂v⊗¯∂p−¯∂v⊗∂p+v∧c.
For this to lie in M, we necessarily have ∂v=¯∂v= 0and then ∂¯∂(v⊗p) =vcand
arguingasbeforeweseethat vccannotbe ∂¯∂-exactin M. Thus (τkMc)k= (τkM)k.
In summary, we have shown τkMc=M⊕c□and so the statement about the
cohomology computation follows again from Lemma 1.16.
Finally, for (3), we consider also τkMc. This time, it is described as follows:
(τkMc)j=

0 ifj > k + 1
(ker∂∩ker¯∂)∩(Mk+1⊕(V⊗ ⟨p⟩))ifj=k+ 1
(τkM)k−1⊕ ⟨∂p,¯∂p⟩ ifj=k
Mk−1⊕ ⟨p⟩ ifj=k−1
Mjifj≤k−1.
and since ∂(m+v⊗p) =∂m+∂v⊗p±v⊗∂p, the degree k+1-part is identified with
ker∂∩ker¯∂∩Mk+1. Thus, again τkMc=M⊕c□and we can apply Lemma 1.16.
For the additional statement about indecomposable classes we note that any
representative of a class in Hk
BC(Mc)that does not already lie in Hk
BC(M)must,
when written as an expression in products of generators, have a nonzero scalar
multiple ∂por¯∂pas a summand and is hence indecomposable. □
In (3) of the previous Lemma, we restricted to the case of [c]̸= 0. However,
if[c] = 0 ∈Hk+1
BC(M), then Mc∼=M⊗ΛLand we can even compute the entire
cohomologyfromTheorem1.35. Inparticular, weagainhaveashortexactsequence
0−→Hk
BC(M)−→Hk
BC(Mc)−→R−→0,
where Rhasdimensionexactlytwointhiscaseandagainconsistsofindecomposable
classes.
Regardless of whether [c] = 0or not, during the construction of the minimal
model, we may wish to get rid of the occuring classes in R, too. However, since
these classes are indecomposable this would break minimality. A naive approach is
to quotient out the ideal they generate. The next Lemmas show that this is indeed
a viable solution.
Lemma 2.32 (Quotienting vs. squaring away) .Consider a cbba M= (Λ V, ∂, ¯∂)
which is free as a bigraded algebra. Let c∈Van generator of pure bidegree which
is∂- and ¯∂-closed and Mc=M(p, ∂p, ¯∂p|∂¯∂p=c)as above. Then the projection
map to the quotient by the ideal generated by c
pr:Mc−→M/(c)
is a weak equivalence.
Proof.We have to show that I= ker pr is acyclic. Pick some splitting V=V′⊕⟨c⟩
and define a bigraded algebra (without specified differentials) M′:= ΛV′. Then,
as bigraded algebras, there is a canonical identification Mc=M′⊗Λ(p, ∂p, ¯∂p, c).
We distinguish two cases:
Case 1: deg(a) even. In this case, as vector spaces,
I= (M′[p, c])degp+ degc≥1⊕M′[p, c]∂p⊕M′[p, c]¯∂p⊕M′[p, c]∂p¯∂p,
32where the superscript in the first summand means there is at least one por one c
in each monomial.
Let now e∈M′− {0}be any nonzero element. For any integers n≥1, m≥0,
we consider the following subcomplex of I:
Sev
n,m(e):=⟨¯∂(epncm)⟩ ⟨∂¯∂(epncm)⟩
⟨epncm⟩ ⟨∂(epncm)⟩
We compute:
∂(pncme) =npn−1cm∂pe+pncm∂e
¯∂∂(pncme) =n(n−1)pn−2cm¯∂p∂pe −npn−1cm+1e
−npn−1cm∂p¯∂e+npn−1¯∂pcm∂e+pncm¯∂∂e
Now the five summands are all orthogonal with respect to the decomposition
Mc=M
k,l∈N
ε¯ε∈{0,1}M′pkln(∂p)ε(¯∂p)¯ε
and so ∂¯∂(pncme)is not zero, which means Sn,m(e). Furthermore, denoting by
B(M′)a vector space basis for M′consisting of pure bidegree elements, we see that
I=M
n≥1,m≥0
e∈B(M′)Sev
n,m(e),
i.e.Iis acyclic.
Case 2: deg(a) odd. In this case, define for any e∈M′− {0}andn, m≥0
the following subcomplex of I:
Sodd
n,m(e):=⟨¯∂(e(∂p)n(¯∂p)mp)⟩ ⟨∂¯∂(e(∂p)n(¯∂p)mp)⟩
⟨e(∂p)n(¯∂p)mp⟩ ⟨∂(e(∂p)n(¯∂p)mp)⟩
As before, we calculate
∂((∂p)n(¯∂p)mpe) =m(∂p)n(¯∂p)m−1cpe+ (∂p)n+1(¯∂p)me−(∂p)n(¯∂p)mp∂e
¯∂∂((∂p)n(¯∂p)mpe) =−(n+m+ 1)( ∂p)n(¯∂p)mce+m(∂p)n(¯∂p)m−1cp¯∂e
+ (∂p)n+1(¯∂p)m¯∂e+n(∂p)n−1(¯∂p)mcp∂e
−(∂p)n(¯∂p)m+1∂e+ (∂p)n(¯∂p)mp¯∂∂e
Again, all summands are orthogonal with respect to the vector space decomposition
Mc=M
k,l∈N
ε,η∈{0,1}M′(∂p)k(¯∂p)lpϵcη.
Therefore, each Sodd
n,m(e)is acyclic and hence so is
I=M
n,m∈N
e∈B(M′)Sodd
n,m(e)
□
33Example 2.33. Taking M= Λ⟨c⟩, we see that the algebra freely generated by a
square, Mc= Λ(p, ∂p, ¯∂p, ∂ ¯∂p)is contractible (as an augmented cbba). In fact,
Mc=C⊕M
Sn,m,
where Sn,m:=Sev/odd
n,m (1).
2.6.Minimal models: existence.
Theorem 2.34. LetAbe a cohomologically simply connected, augmented cbba.
Then there exists a simply connected minimal model φ:M→A. Furthermore, if
HA(A)andHBC(A)are degree-wise finite dimensional, then so is Mand if Ais
inRCBBA, one may take φinRCBBA, too.
The algorithm to produce such M→Ais in principle the familiar one from
cdga’s: Work by induction on the degree and add generators to obtain cohomo-
logical surjectivity, then add more generators to enforce all necessarily relations.
This is in principle also what happens in the proof of the fibration-cofibration re-
placement in Theorem 2.1 (but the maximal approach there produces generators
in negative degrees). An important difference to the cdga case is that to enforce
relations a given degree, we may have to add new generators in degree 2less, and
this makes the verification of (degree-wise)termination of this algorithm technically
more involved.
Proof.We will inductively build partial models (Mk, φk), where
(1)Mkis minimal, simply connected and generated in total degrees 2, ..., k.
(2)Mkis a nilpotent extension of Mk−1arising by adding generators in degrees
k, k−1, with ∂¯∂≡0on the degree kgenerators.
(3)φk:Mk→Ais a map of cbba’s extending φk−1, such that H≤k+1
BC (φk)is
injective and H≤k−1
A (φk)is surjective.
To start the induction note that for cohomologically simply connected A, the
unit map C→Ainduces an isomorphism in H≤1
Aand is injective in H≤3
BC. So from
now on, we assume k≥2.
Step 1: Surjectivity Assume we are given (Mk, φk). We will construct a
nilpotent extension Mk⊆fMkwhich is still minimal and adds only generators in
degree k, k+ 1that have no differential in degree k+ 2and a map eφ:fMk→A
extending φs.t.H≤k+1
BC (eφk)is still injective and H≤k
A(eφk)is surjective.
Consider a bigraded vector space C⊆ker∂¯∂∩Awhich projects isomorphically
onto coker Hk
A(φk). Then set M′:=Mk⊗Λ(L(C)[1,1])and define φ′:M′→Ato
extend φvia the map induced by the identity on V. Then the inclusion Mk→M′
induces an injection in Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomology and an isomorphism in
H≤k
BCandH≤k−1
A, whereas there is a canonical isomorphism Hk
A(M′)∼=Hk
A(Mk)⊕
V. Thus φ′is surjective in H≤k
Aand injective in H≤k
BC. IfHk+1
BC(φ′)is injective, we
are done here, and can go to the next step.
However, Hk+1
BC(φ′)will generally not be injective, as
HBC(M′) =Hk+1
BC(Mk)⊕(∂⊗C)⊕(¯∂⊗C)
. So assume we have a bigraded vector space {0} ̸=R⊆M′k+1(‘relations’) pro-
jecting isomorphically onto kerHk+1
BC(φ′)and define P:=R[−1,−1](‘primitives’).
Now form M′
R:=M′⊗RΛ(□⊗P), i.e. the pushout of the diagram
Λ(R) Λ(□⊗P)
M′,
34where the vertical map is induced by inclusion and, writing pr:=r∈P=
R[−1,−1], the horizontal map is induced by r7→∂¯∂⊗pr.
This is a nilpotent extension of M′, and by Lemma 2.30, the inclusion M′⊆M′
R
induces isomorphisms H≤k
A(M′)∼=H≤k
A(M′

basis riofr, pick pure-degree elements si∈As.t.∂¯∂si=φ(ri)and define φ′
R(1⊗
pri):=si. By definition, H≤k+1
BC (φ′
R)is injective and H≤k
A(φ′
R)is surjective.
On the first glance, it seems we can stop here. However, since Hk+1
BC(φ)is
injective, Rnecessarily consists of indecomposable elements and so M′
Rwill never
be nilpotent. On the other hand, fMk:=M′/(R)is still a nilpotent extension of
Mkand minimal.
In summary, we have the following diagram:
M′
R
Mk M′A,
fMkφ′
R
pr
where all the maps on the left are nilpotent extensions, hence cofibrant, and the
vertical map (given by projection) is an acyclic fibration by Lemma 2.32. Thus, by
the left-lifting property, there exists a map s:fMk→M′
Rs.t.pr◦s= Idand the
restriction s|Mkcoincides with the inclusion Mk⊆M′
R. We may then define a map
eφk:fMk→Abyφ′
R◦s. Because it extends φonMkandprand hence sare weak
equivalences, it is surjective in H≤k
Aand injective in H≤k+1
BC.
Step 2: Injectivity To avoid overloading notation, we now assume that
(Mk, φk) = (fMk,eφk)
from the previous step and forget about all the intermediate spaces used there.
We want to construct (Mk+1, φk+1), i.e. we need to make the map in Hk+2
BC
injective. Let K⊆ker∂∩ker¯∂∩(Mk)k+2be a bigraded vector space which
maps isomorphically onto kerHk+2
BC(φk)and let Q:=K[−1,−1], where we write
qk=k∈K[−1,−1]. Then denote by M′the pushout of the diagram
Λ(K) Λ(□⊗Q)
Mk.
Note that M′is a nilpotent extension of Mand because Mkhas no generators in
degree k+ 2,M′is minimal. Further, by Lemma 2.30, the inclusion Mk→M′
induces isomorphisms H≤k
BC(Mk)∼=H≤k
BC(M′)andH≤k+1
A (Mk)∼=H≤k+1
A (M′)and
short exact sequences
0−→kerHk+2
BC(φk)−→Hk+2
BC(M)−→Hk+2
BC(M′)−→0
and
0−→Hk+1
BC(Mk)−→Hk+1
BC(M′)−→ R −→ 0,
where Ris a vector space of dimension at most 2 dim Kand class in Hk+1
BC(M′)
mapping to something nontrivial in Ris represented by indecomposable elements.
35Define a map φ′:M′→Aextending φkas follows: Choose a basis {ki}forKand
pickli∈Aof bidegrees |ki|−(1,1)s.t.∂¯∂li=ki. Then set φ′(qki):=li. Note that
by construction Hk+2
BC(φ′)andH≤k
BC(φ′)are injective and H≤k
A(φ′)are surjective.
However, since we (potentially) increased Hk+1
BC, we might have introduced a new
kernel in that degree. Pick a space R⊆M′k+1which projects isomorphically onto
R. Note that it is an indecomposable space, as it must map isomorphically onto a
subspace of (∂⊗Q)⊕(¯∂⊗Q)under the projection
R→Q(M′)k+1=Q(M)k+1⊕(∂⊗Q)⊕(¯∂⊗Q)→(∂⊗Q)⊕(¯∂⊗Q).
Now, set Mk+1:=M′/(R), which is a nilpotent extension of Mkand minimal. To
compute its cohomology and define φk+1, we consider M′
R:=M′⊗RΛ(□⊗P)
where P:=R[−1,−1]. By Lemma 2.32, the projection M′
R→Mk+1is a quasi-
isomorphism. By Lemma 2.30, the inclusion M′→M′
Rinduces isomorphisms
H≤k
BC(M′)∼=H≤k
BC(M′
R),Hk+2
BC(M′)∼=Hk+2
BC(M′
R)andH≤k+1
A (M)∼=H≤k+1
A (M′
R)
and a short exact sequence
0−→ ⟨ [r]⟩r∈R−→Hk+1
BC(M′)−→Hk+1
BC(M′
R)−→0
and so the map Hk+1
BC(Mk)→Hk+1
BC(M′
R)is an isomorphism. Now we can define a
map φ′
Rextending φ′as the previous times, by picking ∂¯∂-primitives sifor a basis
{ri}forRand setting φ′
R(pri):=siand by definition it will be injective in H≤k+2
BC
and surjective in H≤k
BC. Again, M′
Rmay not be minimal and we argue as at the
end of the surjectivity step to obtain from this map the required φk+1:Mk+1→A
with all the required properties. □
Remark 2.35. The algorithm presented in the proof is not optimal. In fact,
the necessity for ‘re-minimalization’ at the end of the surjectivity and injectivity
steps indicates that we could have made more sensible choices in adding generators
beforehand. Inconcreteexamples,itwillusuallybeclearhowtomakethosesensible
choices. Note also that if we are just interested in a connected nilpotent (not
necessarily minimal) model, we can omit these steps. The resulting model will still
be degree-wise finite dimensional if HABC(A)was.
Corollary2.36. For holomorphically simply connected manifolds, the isomorphism
class of the homotopy bicomplex π(X, x)inHo(BiCo) is independent of the basepoint
x∈X.
We will therefore often write π(X)instead of π(X, x).
3.Examples and applications
3.1.Elementary examples. A real bigraded minimal model for projective space
CPnis given by
MCPn:= Λ(y, z, ∂z, ¯∂z|∂¯∂z=iyn+1)|y|= (1,1),|z|= (n, n),
where y, zare real and φCPn:MCPn→ACPnsends yto a Kähler form ωand all
other generators map to zero. The isomorphism class of the homotopy bicomplex
is thus given by a dot in degree (1,1)and an Lwith corner in degree (n, n).
Remark 3.1. As this example shows, even if we start with a compact Kähler
manifold, the homotopy bicomplex will generally not satisfy the ∂¯∂-Lemma.
A real bigraded model for a torus Tn=Cn/Γis given by
MTn:= Λ(x1, ..., x n,¯x1, ...,¯xn),|xi|= (1,0), d≡0,
where xiand¯xiare conjugate and φTn:MTn→ATnsends xitodziwhere ziare
holomorphic coordinates on Cn.
363.2.Complete intersections. We will compute the first stages of a minimal
model for Kähler manifolds with the Hodge diamond of complete intersections of
dimension n >1. As applications we compute the Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomo-
topy groups and prove that such manifolds are formal in a strong sense.
Let(X, ω)be a compact Kähler manifold with the Hodge diamond of a complete
intersection of dimension n >1. I.e., denoting by δ= 1ifn/2∈Zand0else:
hp,q(X) =

1 p=q̸=n/2
dp,qp+q=nandp̸=q
dp,q+δ p +q=nandp=q
0 else,
where dp,qdenotes the dimension of the space of primitive harmonic (p, q)-forms.
E.g., for n= 2,3the Hodge diamonds look as follows:
1
0 0
d2,0d1,1+ 1 d0,2
0 0
11
0 0
0 1 0
d3,0d2,1d1,2d0,3
0 1 0
0 0
1
Since Xis Kähler, it satisfies the ∂¯∂-Lemma, so HBC(X)∼=H¯∂(X)∼=HA(X)
and the entire additive quasi-isomorphism type of AXis determined by the Hodge
numbers. Every complete intersection of dimension n≥2is of course an example,
but there are many others, e.g. any Kähler surface with b1= 0.
Let us build a minimal model (M, φ)forX, following the above algorithm. Note
that it is applicable since AXis bounded and from the conditions on the Hodge
numbers, we see it is simply connected. We will only do so until we reach the stage
where H≤2n
BC(φ)andH≤2n
A(φ)are isomorphisms, since afterwards the construction
ofMand the map φbecomes a formal procedure.
SetM3= Λ( x)with|x|= (1,1)and define φ3:M3→AXbyx7→ω. This
induces injections in H≤2n
BCand surjections in H<n
A, so(M3, φ3) = (Mn, φn). Next,
we denote by Pthe space of primitive harmonic forms in degree nand consider
formal copies Q:=P,∂Q:=P[1,0],¯∂Q:=P[0,1], where we denote qp:=p∈Q,
∂qp:=p∈∂Q,¯∂qp:=p∈¯∂Q. Then define
Mn+1:=Mn(P, Q, ∂Q, ¯∂Q|∂¯∂qp=ixp∀p∈P).
Define φn+1byφn+1(p) =pandφn+1(qp) =φn+1(∂qp) =φn+1(¯∂qp) = 0. Note
that since the pare primitive, we have φn+1(xp) =ω∧p= 0so that φn+1is indeed
a map of bicomplexes.
Lemma 3.2. There are canonical identifications
H≤2n
BC(Mn+1)∼=(Λ(x, P)/(xP))≤2n,
i.e. for all k≤2none has:
Hk
BC(Mn+1)∼=

⟨xj⟩ 2n̸=j= 2k̸=n
P⊕ ⟨δxn/2⟩k=n
Λ2(P)⊕ ⟨xn⟩k= 2n
0 else.
Furthermore, the natural map HBC(M2n+1)→HA(M2n+1)is an isomorphism
in degrees <2nand an injection in degree 2n.
37Proof.Consider the contractible bicomplexes
Sk(Q):=¯∂QxkPxk
Qxk∂Qxk
and denote by B:=C[x]⊕Λ≤2(P)⊕L
kSk(Q). The inclusion B⊆Mn+1is an
isomorphism in degrees <2nin degree 2nhas the complement C2n:= Λ2(Q)⊕Q⊗
P, which does not contain any ∂or¯∂-closed elements and extends to a bicomplex
complement Mn+1=B⊕Cin all degrees (note Sk(Q)is injective and always
splits off as a direct summand). Thus H≤2n
BC(M2n+1) =H≤2n+1
BC (B)and the claim
follows. □
Next, one needs to fix injectivity in H2n
BC. Pick a (bigraded, real) space of
relations R⊆ ⟨xn⟩ ⊕Λ2(P)⊆M2n
n+1, that maps isomorphically onto the kernel
ofH2n
BC(φn+1). Note that by the cohomology calculation above, it is possible to
pick Rinside that subspace and that it is a vector space complement of ⟨xn⟩ ⊆
⟨xn⟩ ⊕Λ2(P). Then, define S:=R[−1,−1],∂S:=R[0,−1],¯∂S:=R[−1,0]and,
writing again sr:=r∈R[−1,−1]etc., we define
M′:=M2n+1(S, ∂S, ¯∂S|∂¯∂sr=ir∀r∈R)
andφ′to extend φn+1by mapping srto a∂¯∂-primitive of φ(ir)(chosen linearly
inr). We now have achieved surjectivity in H≤2n
Aand injectivity in H≤2n
BC.
Let us pause for a moment and note what we have shown so far:
Proposition 3.3. A minimal model for a compact complex Kähler manifold X
with the Hodge diamond of a complete intersection of dimension n≥2is given by
a nilpotent extension
M=M′⊗Λ(D),
where M′= Λ(x, P, Q, ∂Q, ¯∂Q, S, ∂S, ¯∂S|. . .)is as constructed as above and Dis
concentrated in degrees ≥2n−1.
Since |D| ≥2n−1, we can read off the bigraded homotopy groups in lower
degrees:
Corollary 3.4. ForXas above, and k≤2n−2, one has
dimπk
BC(X) =

1 k= 2
bn(X)−δ k =n
2·(bn(X)−δ)k=n+ 1
0 else.
and for k≤2n−2:
dimπk
A(X) =

1 k= 2
2·(bn(X)−δ) k=n
δ·(bn(X)−1)2+ (1−δ)· bn(X)
2
k= 2n−2
0 else.
Proof.We have dimP=bn(X)−δ,dim∂Q= dim ¯∂Q= dim Q= dim Pand
dim∂S= dim ¯∂S= dim R= dim Λ2(P)which equals (dim P)2or dimP
2
, depend-
ing on the parity of n. □
38We now prove a formality result. Recall [MS22] that a complex manifold is
strongly (bigradedly) formal, if AXcan be connected by a chain of weak equiva-
lences to a cbba Hwith ∂≡¯∂≡0(one may take H=HBC(X)). Even though
every ∂¯∂-manifold is formal in the usual (de Rham) sense by [DGMS75], this is not
the case for this stronger notion of formality, as it is obstructed by the presence
of bigraded higher operations, which may be nontrivial on ∂¯∂-manifolds by [ST22].
It is an open question whether compact Kähler manifolds are strongly formal in
general.3
Theorem 3.5. Any compact complex Kähler manifold of dimension n≥2with
the Hodge diamond of a complete intersection is strongly formal.
Proof.Pick a partial model φ′:M′→AXas in Proposition 3.3. We define a
map ψ′:M′→HBC(X)as follows: ψ(x) = [ω],ψ′(p) = [p]for any p∈P, and
ψ′(Q) =ψ′(S) = 0. Note that ψ′is indeed a cbba map and that it induces an
isomorphism in H≤2n
BCandH<2n
A.
We now want to extend φto a full model φ:M→AXandψ′to a full bigraded
quasi-isomorphism ψ:M→HBC(X). To do so, we need to analyze the kernel of
H2n
A(φ′). For this, we will split M′additively into subcomplexes up to degree 2n.
We will use the following ad-hoc notation: For any subset V⊆M′, we denote the
sub-bicomplex of M′generated by VbyJVK. For example, JxkQK=Sk(Q)and
JSKis the contractible bicomplex with underlying vector space S⊕∂S⊕¯∂S⊕R.
We distinguish two cases and leave the verification that all sums are indeed direct
to the reader:
Case 1: n≥3.There is a decomposition
M′=nM
k=0⟨xk⟩ ⊕P⊕⌊n/2⌋M
k=0Sk(Q)⊕JSK⊕JΛ2(Q)K⊕JPQ⊕xSK
⊕a subcomplex generated in degrees ≥2n+ 1.
The bicomplexes Sk(Q),JSK,JΛ2(Q)Kare contractible. On the other hand, ∂¯∂is
not injective on JPQ⊕xSK: In fact, ∂¯∂(PQ) =xΛ2(P)and∂¯∂(xS) =xRand
xR+xΛP=⟨xn+1⟩+xΛ2(P)which has smaller dimension than PQ⊕xS.
Case 2: n= 2.We have an additive decomposition into sub-bicomplexes
M′=C⊕ ⟨x⟩ ⊕P⊕S0(Q)⊕JSK
⊕ ⟨x2⟩ ⊕S1(Q)⊕JΛ2(S)K⊕JΛ2(Q)K⊕JQSK⊕JPQ⊕xS⊕PSK
⊕a subcomplex generated in degrees ≥5
where one checks that S1(Q)⊕JΛ2(S)K⊕JΛ2(Q)K⊕JQSKis contractible, but JPQ⊕
xS⊕PSKis not.
To summarize this discussion, H2n
A(M′)is a subquotient of the space ⟨xn⟩ ⊕
PQ⊕(⟨x⟩ ⊕P)2Sand so the kernel of H2n(φ)can be represented by elements in
that space. We now show that one can do slightly better:
Claim: One may modify Sin such a way that the kernel of H2n
A(φ′)has a
system of representatives lying in PQ⊕xS(resp. PQ⊕xS⊕PS).
To prove the claim let s1, ..., s kbe a basis for the vector space
SA:={s∈S| ∃a∈PQ, b ∈(⟨x⟩ ⊕P)2s.t.∂¯∂(a+bs) = 0}
and choose a complement S=SA⊕S′. Now, pick a basis b1, ..., b lfor(⟨x⟩ ⊕P)2
and let αij∈Cs.t.
[φ′(bisj)] = [ αijsj]∈Hn,n
A(X).
3This question was resolved with a negative answer in [PSZ24].
39Letb1, ..., blbeabasisfor (⟨x⟩⊕P)2n−2s.t.[bibj] = [δijxn], with δij= 0ifi̸=jand
δii= 1. Define ˜sj:=sj−Pl
i=1αijbj. Then [φ′(˜sj)] = 0and⟨˜s1, ...,˜sk⟩ ∩S′={0}.
Set˜S:=⟨˜s1, ...,˜sk⟩⊕S′. Sinceweonlymodifiedbyclosedelements, ˜Sisstillaspace
of primitives for Rand we have M′= Λ( x, P, Q, ∂Q, ¯∂Q,˜S, ∂S, ¯∂S|...). On the
other hand, if we now take any element z=c·xn+a+bs∈ ⟨xn⟩⊕PQ⊕(⟨x⟩⊕P)2˜S
s.t.∂¯∂(z) = 0, we have [φ′(z)] = [ cxn]. This finishes the proof of the claim.
From now on assume S=˜Shas the properties of the claim. We may apply the
algorithm of Theorem B to complete (M′, φ′)to a nilpotent model M=M′⊗Λ(D),
where D<2n−2= 0,dD2n−1⊆D2n−1,dD2n−1⊆D2n⊕ker∂¯∂(PQ⊕(⟨x⟩⊕P)2S).
Thus, defining ψto extend ψ′byψ(D) = 0yields a cbba map which is necessarily a
bigraded quasi-isomorphism as it induces surjective maps between equidimensional
vector spaces. □
Remark 3.6. The argument used to prove the intermediate claim is inspired by
[FM05, Thm. 3.1.]. It may be possible to adapt that theorem to the cbba setting
and use it to prove strong formality for larger classes of manifolds, e.g. the compact
Kähler n-folds which have no cohomology in degrees below n/2other than that
coming from the powers of the Kähler class.
3.3.Non-simply connected examples.
3.3.1.Nilmanifolds. A nilmanifold is a quotient X=G/Γof a simply connected
nilpotent Lie group Gby an (automatically co-compact) lattice Γ. A left-invariant
complex structure on X(with respect to the natural G-action) is called nilpotent if
there exists a basis ω1, ..., ω nfor the space of left- G-invariant (1,0)-forms (Al.i.
X)1,0
s.t. for every ione has
dωi=X
j<k<iAijkωj∧ωk+X
j,k<iBijkωj∧¯ωk
for some Aijk, Bijk∈C. Examples of nilmanifolds with nilpotent complex struc-
tures are when Gis itself a complex Lie group or when the complex structure is
abelian, meaning d(Al.i.
X)0,1⊆(Al.i.
X)1,1. We refer to [CFGU00] for a more in-depth
discussion of nilmanifolds and nilpotent complex structures on these, including a
more intrinsic definition in terms of descending series.
Theorem 3.7. For a nilmanifold X=G/Γwith nilpotent complex structure, the
inclusion of left-invariant forms Al.i.
X⊆AXis a real bigraded minimal model.
Proof.The left-invariant forms are canonically a free cbba, generated by the dual
of the complexified Lie-algebra g=Lie(G), i.e. Al.i.
X= Λ( g∨
C). The nilpo-
tency condition means exactly that one can write Al.i.
Xas the union of subcbba’s
Al.i.
X(i):= Λ(ω1, ...ω i,¯ω1, ...,¯ωi)⊆Al.i.
Xand each inclusion Al.i.
X(i)⊆Al.i.
X(i+ 1)is a
Hirsch extension. Thus, the left invariant forms are a nilpotent cbba and, since all
generators are in degree 1, necessarily minimal. By [CFGU00, Main Theorem], the
inclusion Al.i.
X⊆AXinduces an isomorphism in Dolbeault cohomology and so by
conjugation also H∂, thus it is a pluripotential quasi-isomorphism. □
In particular, we see that the isomorphism type of the homotopy bicomplex does
again not depend on the basepoint. Furthermore, as the left-invariant forms are
the free algebra on the dual Lie-algebra, one obtains:
Corollary 3.8. For a nilmanifold Xwith nilpotent complex structure associated
to a Lie algebra gwith complex structure J, there is an isomorphism π(X)∼=g∨
Cin
Ho(RBiCo), where we consider the right hand side as a bicomplex concentrated in
total degree 1with the splitting g∨
C=g1,0
C⊕g0,1
Cinduced by Jand trivial differentials.
40Thismeans, asonewouldexpect, thatnilmanifoldswithnilpotentcomplexstruc-
ture are ‘holomorphically aspherical’. As the following example shows, the situation
is different if we drop the assumption on nilpotency of the complex structure:
Example 3.9. (Homotopy bicomplex of a nilmanifold with non-nilpotent com-
plex structure) The first real dimension in which nilmanifolds with non-nilpotent
left-invariant structures appear is 6. An example is determined by the following
structure equations (for either choice of sign), c.f. [UV14]:
dω1= 0, dω2=ω13+ω1¯3, dω3=±i(ω1¯2−ω2¯1).
Let us denote by Xany compact nilmanifold associated with the corresponding
Lie-algebra. By [Rol09, §.4.2.], the inclusion
Al.i.
X= Λ(ω1, ω2, ω3,¯ω1,¯ω2,¯ω3)⊆AX
is a bigraded weak equivalence. Note that since Al.i.
Xis connected the isomorphism
type of π·,·(X, x)does not depend on the base point. However, while Al.i.
Xis free
as a cbba, it is not nilpotent. A minimal model (MX, φX)is given as follows: As a
bigraded algebra with conjugation we have
MX:= Λ(x,¯x, y,¯y, z, w, ¯w, p, ∂p, ¯∂p),
where the conjugation is determined by taking p, zto be real and otherwise as
indicated by the superscripts. The degrees of the generators are determined by
|p|= (0,0),|x|=|y|=|w|=|∂p|= (1,0),|z|= (1,1).
A differential of type (1,0) + (0 ,1)onMXis determined by
dp=∂p+¯∂p, dx = 0, dy =iz, dw =xy+x¯y, d∂p =i(±(x¯w−w¯x)−z).
The map φ:MX→AXis determined by
φX(x) =ω1, φ X(y) =ω3, φ X(w) =ω3, φ X(z) =±(ω1¯2−ω2¯1), φ X(p) = 0 .
Note that by definition φfactors as
MX Al.i.
X
M′
X,φX
pr
φ′
X
where M′
X:= Λ( x,¯x, y,¯y, z, w, ¯w, z)/(±i(x¯w−w¯x)−iz). Since φ′
Xis an isomor-
phism and pris a pluripotential quasi-isomorphism by Lemma 2.32, the map φX
is indeed a pluripotential quasi-isomorphism.
From MXwe may read off the isomorphism type of the homotopy bicomplex,
which consists of two pairs of conjugate dots in degree (1,0)and(0,1)oneLwith
corner in degree (0,0)and one reverse Lwith corner in degree (1,1). In particular,
one has π1,1
BC(X) =π0,0
A(X) =C.
3.3.2.Hopf manifolds. Denote by Xn:= (Cn\ {0})/Z, where Zacts via scaling
with a real constant λwith|λ| ̸= 0,1. One has diffeomorphisms Xn∼=S2n−1×S1.
Following Greg Kuperberg [Kup10], we consider the real sub-cbba of A⊆AXn
generated by the following 1and2-forms:
α=¯z·dz
z·¯z, ¯α=z·d¯z
z·¯zω=i·dz·d¯z
z·¯z,
where z·¯z=Pn
i=1zi¯zietc. We have
∂α= 0 ¯∂α=α¯α+iω ∂ω =−αω.
Lemma 3.10. The inclusion A⊆AXnis a pluripotential quasi-isomorphism.
41Proof.As noted by Kuperberg, the bicomplex Aconsists of the invariant forms
for the natural action of the compact group U(n)×S1. As such, it is a direct
summand in AXnby averaging, which computes the de Rham cohomology. On
the other hand, the Hodge numbers of Xnare known [Ise60], [Bor78] and as a
consequence, the Frölicher spectral sequence degenerates at the first page and so
the inclusion induces an isomorphism in H¯∂andH∂; since A, A Xnare bounded this
is a pluripotential quasi-isomorphism by Theorem 1.21. □
Since Ais finite dimensional, we may readily compute its cohomology (c.f.
[Ste21], [Kup10]). Namely, we have:
HBC(Xn) =

C k= 0
C[ω−iα¯α]BC k= 2
C[αωn−1]BC⊕C[¯αωn−1]BC k= 2n−1
C[ωn]BC k= 2n
0 else
and
HA(Xn) =

C k= 0
C[α]A⊕C[¯α]Ak= 1
C[α¯αωn−2]A k= 2n−2
C[ωn]A k= 2n
0 else.
Note that the algebra Ais not free. In fact, one has the relation
ωn=iα¯αωn−1.
Proposition3.11. A real bigraded minimal model for Xnis given by (M, φ), where
M= Λ(x,¯x, y, z, ∂z, ¯∂z|¯∂x=y, ∂¯∂z=iyn),
with
|x|= (1,0),|y|= (1,1),|z|= (n−1, n−1)
and
φ(x) =α, φ(y) =ω−iα¯α, φ(z) = 0 .
Proof. Mis clearly minimal and real, so by it suffices to check that φ:M→A
is a quasi-isomorphism, which is a straightforward calculation given the explicit
formulas for the cohomology above. □
Example 3.12 (Dolbeault models for the Hopf surface) .We use the example of
the Hopf surfaces X2to compare bigraded models constructed here to those used
in [NT78]. Recall that [NT78] considers cbba models (not necessarily with real
structure) which are quasi-isomorphisms only with respect to H¯∂. As such, the
models constructed in this article fit into that framework, but others are possible.
For instance, consider the following cbba which is free on two one-sided infinite
zigzags:
MNT:= Λ(x0,1, y1,1, x1,0, y2,0, x2,−1, . . . , x2,1, y3,1, x3,0, y4,0, . . .),
where the generators live in the indicated bidegree and, writing y0,2=y2,2= 0, the
differential is defined by
dxp,q=yp,q+1+yp+1,q.
A map of cbba’s φNT:MNT→AX2with H¯∂(φNT)an isomorphism is given by
sending all generators to zero except
φNT(x0,1) = ¯α, φ NT(y1,1) = ¯αα−iω, φ NT(x1,0) =−α, φ NT(x2,1) =αω.
42As noted in Section 2.3.1, the spectral sequence computed from this model is the
same as that of constructed here (and in fact as for any filtered model). However,
(MNT, φNT)is not a de Rham model, since HdR(MNT) =C̸=HdR(X2).
3.4.Manifolds without connected model. We have seen already in Exam-
ple 3.9 that in general a manifold does not have to admit a connected model, even
if it is cohomologically connected (e.g. compact). This turns out to be not an
uncommon phenomenon as the following two examples illustrate:
Example 3.13 (Riemann surfaces of higher genus) .LetX= Σ gbe a Riemann
surface of genus g≥2with a fixed point x∈X. To build a model for (X, x), one
first adds a formal copy of the space of holomorphic and antiholomorphic forms as
generators, M′:= Λ(Ω1(X)⊕¯Ω1(X)). Then the tautological map φ′:M′→AX
induces an isomorphism in Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomology in degree 1and a
surjection in degree 2. To achieve injectivity in H2
BC, one has to remove
K:= ker 
H2
BC(M′) = Λ2(Ω1(X)⊕¯Ω1(X))−→H2
BC(X) =A2
X/∂¯∂(A0
X)
.
Tokillthiskernel, oneisforcedtoaddanewspacesofgenerators FK∼=∂FK∼=¯∂FK
s.t.∂¯∂FK=K. Thismeansthemodelwillnotbeconnectedandasimilarargument
shows that no nilpotent bigraded model which is bigradedly quasi-isomorphic can
exist. This example leads to very basic analytic questions the answer to which
the author currently does not know: Is φ′|Knecessarily injective? Is Xstrongly
formal?4Also note that the space of primitives for φ′(K)is a canonically defined
finite dimensional space of functions on Xsince the kernel of ∂¯∂in degree (0,0)
consists only of the constants and we fixed a base-point.
Example 3.14 (CdF).The same argument as above shows that any connected
compact complex manifold Xfor which
Λ2(H1
BC(X))→H2
BC(X)
fails to be injective will not have a bigradedly quasi-isomorphic connected model.
Notethattherearetwolinearlyindependentforms ω1, ω2∈H1,0
BC(X)with ω1∧ω2=
0∈H2,0
BC(X)if and only if Xfibres over a curve of genus at least 2. (This is a
formulation of the classical Castelnuovo de Franchis theorem without the Kähler
hypothesis. The proof is the same as in the Kähler setting as it uses only that
ω1, ω2are closed holomorphic.).
The examples in this and the preceeding sections beg the question:
Question 3.15. Under what conditions does a compact complex manifold (resp.
cohomologically connected real cbba) admit a connected model in RCBBA? Under
what conditions is there a model with finitely many generators in each degree?
We note that the condition of injectivity of Λ2H1
BC(X)→H2
BC(X)is not suffi-
cient to ensure existence of a connected model by Example 3.9.
3.5.A question on realizability. One can look at the theory in this article
from the point of view of a complex geometer. Then it gives us new tools with a
topological flavour to structure and study the realm of complex manifolds. Or one
cantakeatopologist’sperspectiveandaskwhat, ifanything, thisnewlyfoundextra
structure tells us about the underlying homotopy type. The most basic instance of
this is the following
Question 3.16 (Sullivan).Which rational cdga’s are quasi-isomorphic (over R) to
a real cbba?
4In [PSZ24] we (later) proved that a Riemann surface of genus g≥2is never strongly formal.
43To avoid technicalities, let us assume we are dealing with cohomologically simply
connected rational cdga’s As.t.H(A;Q)is a finite dimensional vector space. Then
one finds a finite CW-complex CAs.t. the piecewise-linear forms of CAare quasi-
isomorphic to A, [Su77], [GM13]. One may embed CAinto some large R2Nand
thicken it up a little so that it is exhibited as a deformation retract N(CA)≃CA
of a smooth open submanifold N(CA)⊆R2N. Restricting the standard complex
structureof R2NtoN(CA)equipsitwithacomplexstructureandsothereisachain
ofquasi-isomorphismsofrealcdga’sbetween A⊗Randthecdgaofdifferentialforms
onN(CA), where the complexification of the latter naturally has the structure of
a real cbba. Technically, this gives a positive answer to the above question, but
one which is unsatisfying for a number of reasons: The manifolds N(CA)thus
constructed are non-compact and will not satisfy Serre duality, even if Adid. They
are of higher dimension than the cohomology of Asuggests and their cohomology
(Dolbeault or Bott-Chern) will generally be infinite-dimensional.5The following
version thus remains open:
Question3.17. Whichconnectedrationalcdga’ssatisfying 2n-dimensionalPoincaré
duality that have the cdga of forms on a compact almost complex manifold in
their homotopy type, are quasi-isomorphic over Rto cohomologically connected
real cbba’s with finite-dimensional cohomology concentrated in the first quadrant
satisfying Serre duality?
Note that the realizability by compact almost complex manifolds is well under-
stood, and depends only on the cohomology ring c.f. [Mil22], so that the above is
– in principle – an algebraic question.
