Abstract 
 
Calculating magnetic properties of two-dimensional materials is crucial for implementing memory 
devices (like USB drive, RAM, hard disk drive of computers) having reduced size. Two 
dimensional materials can be implemented as a thin film which can reduce the size of memory 
devices. These materials as well as devices made with magnetic two-dimensional materials are of 
current research interest in industry and academia. From the materials project database, crystal 
structure file of 30 two dimensional materials have been downloaded to calculate their magnetic 
properties.  BURAI Quantum espresso software has been used to extract magnetic properties of 
30 two dimensional (2D) materials. These 30 materials have magnetic Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, and Cr 
atoms in their molecular structure. Magnetic materials play a key and vital role in today’s modern-
day technology. There are five different types of magnetic materials. The classification magnetic 
materials are diamagnetism, paramagnetic, ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, and anti-
ferromagnetism. Total energy of different magnetic configurations has been calculated to find the 
most stable magnetic configurations of these materials. 
 
1. Introduction 
BURAI Quantum ESPRESSO is a free first-principles electronic-structure calculator and materials 
modeler which is used to calculate different properties of the materials. ESPRESSO is an acronym 
for Open-Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization. The 
software is based on density-functional theory (DFT), and is used to calculate total energy, and 
magnetic moment.  
 
Two dimensional materials are first extracted from materials database. Then the materials were 
analyzed to find its magnetic properties. Materials have been identified as ferromagnetic or 
antiferromagnetic materials from the calculated lowest total energy which is also called ground or 
more stable state. Antiferromagnetic materials can store a larger amount of data compared to 
ferromagnetic materials. Magnetic moment is also calculated which shows the magnetic strength 
in a material. Extracted parameters and properties can be used to simulate new memory devices 
and smaller chips. 
 
The name of the software used is called Burai 1.3 expresso, and it is excellent. This software will 
allow you to run different calculation methods such as SCF, band, and geometric and each of these 
will let you run different calculations and they all serve its own purpose. Quantum espresso is a 
suite for first-principles electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling, distributed for free and as free software under the GNU General Public License. It is based on density-functional 
theory, plane wave basis sets, and pseudopotentials. When it comes to running calculations for the 
software of Burai 1.3 the pseudopotentials are everything. The pseudopotentials are like your 
directions to a hard piece to put together or a label that’s on the outside of a food box. When 
running calculations without the pseudopotentials the calculation will not run at all. This software 
is used to run calculations such as band structure, band, and SCF and find out if different objects 
and materials are magnetic and if they are magnetic are they antiferromagnetic or just 
ferromagnetic. Through using this you can also tell the band gap of the material and it is the gap 
in the different bands of the material if the material has multiple bands. If it has multiple bands 
and they are very spacious then of course the band gap would be high but if they are not to far 
apart then the band cap would be closer together and band gap would not be as high. At the end of 
the DFT calculations you are going to calculate all the ground state properties. Two electrons can 
interact with electronic charge, and they also can by their spin and mutual repulsions and 
attractions can be casualty for this. The main equations for calculating this is the Kohn-Shom 
equation. When you have a DFT package that you are trying to calculate give an input of atomic 
number position to make sure it is correct, then use any software to extract positions in a suitable 
format. A magnetic material in my personal way of viewing it is any material that has a magnetic 
field in it whether it is on the periodic table or not and if it is magnetic, it can be antiferromagnetic 
or it can just be regularly ferromagnetic. The magnetic field on a magnetic object is invisible but 
it holds so many responsibilities when it comes to the magnetic. The most notable property of a 
magnetic is a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, 
and attracts or repels another magnetic. These magnetic materials vary so wide in range to the 
point it may be difficult to pinpoint. They vary on a scale from ten to one hundred newton meters 
with a defined structure for a particular application. Magnetic materials play a key and vital role 
in today’s modern-day technology. Without the use of magnetic materials in the world a lot of the 
resources and everyday life things we use would be harder to make or would not hold as much 
value as they would without the magnetic materials in them. For example, when you look at motors, 
transformers, and generators we all use these things in our everyday life and the key component 
of all these examples are the magnetic materials that are inside of them. The magnetic materials 
have been around for three thousand fiver hundred years, and it was first discovered in Magnesia. 
It has been around almost as long as the compass which has been around for four thousand five 
hundred years. The nineteen eighty’s saw continued improvements in magnetic alloys, rapidly 
accelerating in thin films and surfaces, and the magnetic recording developments those activities 
supported, as well as the emergence of permanent magnets. The nineteen nineties were special 
because that’s when they had done research and reached the emergence of one of the nicest 
magnetic materials which was the nanocrystalline magnetic material. This material is used for 
effective antimicrobial for treating wounds especially burns and chronic wounds. This also reduces 
the inflammatory processes and promotes would healing and is less toxic than other forms of silver 
dressings due to the prolonged release of silver to the wound.  
 
Quantum ESPRESSO is a free first-principles electronic-structure calculator and materials 
modeler. ESPRESSO is an acronym for (Open-Source Package for Research in Electronic 
Structure, Simulation, and Optimization). The software is based on density-functional theory, 
plane wave basis sets, and pseudopotentials (both norm-conserving and ultrasoft). Quantum 
ESPRESSO was used to calculate and graph operations that are common in SCF (Self-Consistent 
Fields) and DFT (Density Functional Theory).   
The conduction band is a delocalized band of energy partly filled with electrons in a crystalline 
solid. These electrons have great mobility and are responsible for electrical conductivity. Valence 
bands are the bands of electron orbitals that electrons can jump out of, moving into the conduction 
band when excited. The valence band is simply the outermost electron orbital of an atom of any 
specific material that electrons occupy. Band gaps are the minimum amount of energy required for 
an electron to break free of its bound state. When the band gap energy is met, the electron is excited 
into a free state, and can therefore participate in conduction. 
 
Solid-state physics describes the electronic band structure by the range of energy levels that 
electrons may have within it, as well as the ranges of energies not found (band gap). They are 
typically depicted on a 2D graph by graphing the energies of crystal orbitals in a crystalline 
material. Conductors (metals) have no band gaps between the valence and conduction band, this 
means that electrons can move freely between valence and conduction bands. Insulators have large 
gaps between valence bands and conduction bands, this means that the conduction band is empty, 
and the material cannot conduct electricity. Semiconductors have small gaps between the valence 
band and conduction band. This allows for certain electrons (given sufficient energy) to pass 
through the valence and conduction band. 
 
Density of states describes the proportion of states that are occupied by the system at each energy. 
It is represented mathematically through a probability density function and averages the space and 
time domains that its various states occupied by the system. Density of states of matter is also 
continuous.   
 
Density-functional theory is the computational quantum mechanical modelling method used in 
physics, chemistry, and material science. DFT is used to investigate the electronic structure of 
many-bodied systems, mainly molecules, atoms, and their condensed matter. What is crystal 
structure in real space and k-points in reciprocal space. DFT calculations allow the equilibrium 
particle density and prediction of thermodynamic properties and the behavior of many-bodied 
systems on the basis model of interactions between particles. Spatially dependent density is used 
to determine the local structure and composition of materials.   
 
A crystal structure is defined as the repeating arrangement of atoms (molecules or ions) throughout 
a crystal. Structure refers to the internal arrangement of particles and not the external appearance 
of the crystal. Crystal structures can be described in several ways. When described it usually refers 
to the size and shape of a unit cell and the positions of the atoms within the cell. However, 
insufficient information can cause a poor understanding of the true structure within three 
dimensions. There are several factors to consider such as the atoms unit cells arrangement, contact, 
and distance are used to create a full understanding. Solid state theory defines “k-space” refers to 
reciprocal space. However, in electronic structure theory k-points serve a more specific purpose. 
They are used as sampling points in the first Brillouin zone of material. This typically refers to the 
specific region of reciprocal space that is closest to the origin (0,0,0).  
 
2. Procedure 
Magnetic materials applications are the creation and distribution of electricity and are also in 
appliances that run using electricity. They are used for like storage of data on audio and video tape as well as on the computer desktop. There are five different types of magnetic materials. The 
magnetic materials are diamagnetism, paramagnetic, ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, 
antiferromagnetic. Ferromagnetic material are materials that exhibit a spontaneous net 
magnetization at the atomic level, even in the absence of an external magnetic field and some 
examples of ferromagnetic materials are iron, cobalt, and nickel. Ferrimagnetic materials are the 
populations of atoms with opposing magnetic moments. For ferrimagnetic materials, these 
moments are unequal in magnitude, so a spontaneous magnetization remains. Ferrimagnetic 
material do not have a plethora of examples, but the best example of this material would be 
magnetite. Antiferromagnetic is a magnetism in solids such as manganese oxide in which adjacent 
ions that behave as tiny magnetic fields spontaneously align themselves at relatively low 
temperatures into opposite, or antiparallel, arrangements throughout the material so that it exhibits 
almost no gross external magnetism. Examples of antiferromagnetic materials Hematite, 
chromium, alloys of iron manganese and oxides of nickel. Crystal structure is defined as the 
repeating arrangement of atoms throughout a crystal. Structure refers to the internal arrangements 
of particles and not the external appearance of the crystal. The simple cubic shell is just a cube 
with an atom on each corner. This also belongs to the space group two hundred and twenty-one. 
Face-centered cubic is an atom arrangement found in nature. This cell structure consists of atoms 
arranged in a cube where each corner of the cube has a fraction of an atom with six additional full 
atoms positioned at the center of each cube face. A body centered cube just like the face-centered 
cube is an atom that is found in nature. Its makeup is a cell structure that consist of atoms arranged 
in a cube where each corner of the cube shares an atom and with one atom positioned at the center 
this is how the body centered cubic works so well. When doing a spin polarized calculation first 
you will set the parameters on however you want to, or you can leave the parameters in the default, 
and you can use any pseudopotential when trying to calculate it. You will set the starting 
magnetizations and then once everything is set you will click on the run button and then save it 
and run it as a SCF calculation and then once the file is done running you will go to the output file 
and look at the total magnetization and watch how the graph is converging and it will show you 
the magnetization.

4. Conclusion 
Many materials and devices that aid in the creation of tiny chips utilized in a variety of applications 
have been the subject of research over the past few decades [1-14]. Here two dimensional materials 
are first extracted from materials database. Then the materials were analyzed to find its properties. 
Extracted parameters and properties can be used to simulate new memory devices and smaller 
chips.
