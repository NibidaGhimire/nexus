Abstract— The application of Artificial intelligence for 
teaching an d learning in the academic sphere is a trending 
subject of interest in the computing education. ChatGPT, as an 
AI-based tool, provides various advantages, such as heightened 
student involvement, cooperation, accessibility and availability. 
This paper addre sses the prospects and obstacles associated 
with utilizing ChatGPT as a tool for learning and assessment in 
undergraduate Computer Science curriculum in particular to 
teaching and learning fundamental programming courses. 
Students having completed the cour se work for a Data 
Structures and Algorithms (a sophomore level course) 
participated in this study. Two groups of students were given 
programming challenges to solve within a short period of time. 
The control group (group A) had access to text books and no tes 
of programming courses, however no Internet access was 
provided. Group B students were given access to ChatGPT and 
were encouraged to use it to help solve the programming 
challenges. The challenge was conducted in a computer lab 
environment using Progr amming Contest Control (PC2) 
environment which is widely used in ACM International 
Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Each team of 
students address the problem by writing executable code that 
satisfies certain number of test cases. Student teams were 
scored based on their performance in terms of number of 
successful passed testcases. Results show that students using 
ChatGPT had an advantage in terms of earned scores, however 
there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the submitted 
code consequently affecting the overall performance. After a 
thorough analysis, the paper's findings indicate that 
incorporating AI in higher education brings about various 
opportunities and challenges. Nonetheless, universities can 
efficiently manage these apprehensions by  adopting a proactive 
and ethical stance towards the implementation of such tools.

I. INTRODUCTION  
The progress made in machine learning and natural 
language processing (NLP) has led to a surge in research 
interest for chatbots, which have been employed in a diverse 
range of commercial and non -commercial applications [1 -3]. 
The emergence of ChatGPT and other AI -powered text 
generation technologies has brought them into the spotlight 
for educators and scholars. The availability of ChatGPT and 
similar technologies has raised many questions for 
educational professionals, policymakers, and researchers [4 -
5]. Using ChatGPT in computer science education has the 
potential to offer several benefits.  
In the context of informatics education, ChatGPT can be 
a valuable tool for teaching and learning fundamental 
concepts of computing such as programming languages, dat a 
structures, algorithms etc. It can help students to review and 
study, especially when they struggle to find study partners or 
don't have time to attend tutoring. The technology has the 
potential to streamline the research and learning process, 
making it easier for students to access information and complete assignments. Additionally, it can also grade and 
provide feedback on assignments, giving teachers more time 
to create engaging lesson plans and focus more attention on 
their students. However, it is im portant to control ChatGPT 
use to avoid potential negative impacts, especially for 
students. Teachers and lecturers are concerned that the 
chatbot may increase plagiarism and spread academic 
dishonesty, which could negatively impact academic 
integrity [3, 10]. While ChatGPT can provide a clear formula 
for producing written work, it may not necessarily improve 
critical thinking and problem -solving skills. Nevertheless, 
these potential dangers can be mitigated by providing 
students with tools and resources fo r identifying and 
avoiding inaccurate information.  
Computer Science educators generally believe that 
hands -on experience in a computer lab environment, help 
students gain valuable experience [6 -7]. In addition to 
effective book/classroom learning, practica l work provides 
students with insight into the methods of science, research 
practice, and experimental methodology. The incorporation 
of scientific research into schools through pedagogical 
principles, rather than strict scientific formalism, is often 
categorized into three main learning goals: learning science, 
learning about science, and learning to do science, which 
involves engaging in and developing expertise in scientific 
inquiry and problem -solving [8]. Practical work has been 
shown to promote studen ts' positive attitudes and enhance 
motivation for effective learning [9 -10]. New approaches for 
teaching and assessing scientific inquiry and practices are 
essential for guiding students to make informed decisions.  
Prince Sultan University's College of Co mputer and 
Information Sciences features three undergraduate programs, 
namely Computer Science, Information Systems, and 
Software Engineering, all of which are accredited by ABET. 
These programs mandate students to complete 124 credit 
hours of study [11]. Additionally, students who choose to 
enroll in any of these programs must take three consecutive 
courses - CS101 Programming I, CS102 Programming II, 
and CS210 Data Structures and Algorithms, during the first 
two years of study. These courses provide a com prehensive 
understanding of Java programming language concepts and 
structures. The CS101 course comprises a lab component in 
which students must attend weekly sessions to learn and 
apply problem -solving skills using a prevalent IDE. 
Conversely, CS102 and C S210 adopt a project -based 
approach to learning, where students collaborate on real -life 
scenarios and devise solutions to address them. The main 
emphasis of the CS102 project is to implement an object -
oriented approach to storing data in a structured mann er. The 
primary objective of the CS210 project is to utilize 
appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve the 
problem while adhering to specific time and space 
limitations. Once a student completes the CS210 course, 
he/she may take advanced courses in computing/engineering 
within their program of study.  This study aims to scrutinize the efficacy of ChatGPT in 
enhancing students' learning capabilities in the initial 
programming courses of a Computing curriculum. One of the 
principal objectives of this  study is to gauge the effectiveness 
of ChatGPT in the students' learning process. Additionally, 
we seek to explore how effectively this technology can be 
employed to evaluate students' performance in online project 
assessments. With this objective in mind , students who were 
undertaking the CS210 - Data Structures and Algorithms 
course were motivated to take part in a computing challenge. 
During the programming challenge, two sets of students 
were given a limited time to solve programming problems. 
The cont rol group (Group A) was granted access to 
textbooks and programming notes but was not given internet 
access. On the other hand, Group B was allowed to use 
ChatGPT to help tackle the programming problems. The 
challenge was conducted in a computer lab enviro nment, 
employing the Programming Contest Control (PC2) system, 
which is widely used in the ACM International Collegiate 
Programming Contest (ICPC). Each team of students tackled 
the problem by crafting executable code that meets specific 
test case requirem ents. The performance of the student teams 
was graded based on the number of successful test cases. The 
outcomes demonstrate that students who used ChatGPT had 
an edge in terms of earned scores; however, inconsistencies 
and inaccuracies in the submitted co de negatively impacted 
their overall performance.  
We make the following contributions in this work  
• In the experimental study, two sets of students 
participating in the challenge were observed, and their 
performance with and without ChatGPT was recorded, 
resulting in a dataset for further research.  
• A comprehensive examination of the impact of ChatGPT 
on this challenge is provided, discussing the advantages 
and disadvantages of its use in education.  
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains a 
related works section that describes the ChatGPT technology 
and its recent applications in the education sector. Section 3 
outlines the methodology used in this research, followed by 
section 4, which presents the results and outcomes. Section 5 
provides a discussion analyzing the results and offering 
recommendations for educators and researchers. Finally, 
Section 6 concludes the paper.  
II. RELATED WORKS  
Although ChatGPT is a recent addition to the public 
domain, it has already captured significant research interest. 
In the following section, we present recent studies that 
describe the technology and explore its potential applications 
for research.  
A. What is ChatGPT?  
Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence 
(AI), refers to the ability of computer systems to lear n from 
experience without being explicitly programmed. With 
advancements in computing power, more data availability, 
and algorithmic improvements, deep learning has emerged as 
a high -performing predictive tool [1 -4]. The field of Natural 
Language Processin g (NLP) has witnessed significant 
growth over the past few years. However, the emergence of 
ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre -trained Transformer) in 
November 2022 has generated a renewed interest and enthusiasm for this technology. ChatGPT, developed by 
OpenAI  [17], is a large language model with remarkable 
abilities in comprehending and producing language that 
closely resembles human speech. Its impressive performance 
in answering questions, engaging in conversations, and 
generating coherent and contextually r elevant responses has 
marked a significant milestone in the advancement of 
conversational Artificial Intelligence. Despite its advanced 
capabilities, ChatGPT is essentially a complex chatbot that 
can trace its roots in the early stages of Long Short -Term 
Memory (LSTM) development [14] and have been 
extensively employed in various fields, including automated 
customer service support, E -Commerce, Healthcare, and 
Education.  
OpenAI's release of the GPT -3 model family has raised 
the bar considerably for its main  rivals, Google and 
Facebook, and represents a significant milestone in the 
advancement of natural language processing (NLP) models 
[12]. The largest GPT -3 configuration, which consists of 175 
billion parameters, 96 attention layers, and a batch size of 3. 2 
million training samples, was trained using 300 billion 
tokens, typically sub -words [15]. The training process of 
GPT -3 draws on the successful strategies employed by its 
predecessor, GPT -2, such as modified initialization, pre -
normalization, and reverse  tokenization. However, GPT -3 
also introduces a new refinement based on alternating dense 
and sparse attention patterns. GPT -3 is designed as an 
autoregressive framework that can achieve task -agnostic 
goals through a few -shot learning paradigm [15]. With i ts 
ability to adapt to various tasks with minimal training data, it 
is a versatile and powerful tool for NLP applications.  
All GPT (Generative Pre -trained Transformer) models, 
including the most recent GPT -4 model, are built based on 
the core technology of  Transformers. The Transformer 
architecture was first introduced in the seminal paper 
"Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017 [16], 
which has significantly impacted the deep learning research 
community. Transformers have revolutionized the pr ocessing 
of sequence -to-sequence models, surpassing traditional 
models based on recurrent neural networks by a significant 
margin. While Transformers follow the classical encoder -
decoder architecture, they differ dramatically by integrating 
self-attention modules that excel in capturing long -term 
dependencies between input sequence elements (i.e., tokens). 
By leveraging this information, it efficiently determines the 
importance of each element in the input sequence. The self -
attention mechanism computes a w eight for each element 
based on its relevance to other tokens in the sequence. This 
enables Transformers to handle variable -length sequences 
more effectively and capture complex relationships between 
the sequence elements, thus improving performance on 
various natural language processing tasks. Trained on a vast 
dataset of 570 GB of Internet data, ChatGPT possesses 
several features that make it stand out among its peers, 
particularly in terms of accurate natural language generation 
[17]. These features are a significant advantage for ChatGPT.  
B. Applications of ChatGPT in education and research  
ChatGPT, a cutting -edge chatbot developed by OpenAI, 
has already captured the interest of researchers despite its 
recent release to the public domain. In this sect ion, we will 
delve into recent studies that explore the numerous 
applications and research possibilities of ChatGPT.  In [13] Wang et.al., conducted an assessment of 
ChatGPT's ability to support various design, manufacturing, 
and engineering education task s. Their findings highlight 
ChatGPT's impressive capacity to provide information, 
generate structured content, and propose initial solutions in a 
comprehensive and creative manner, demonstrating its 
potential to support tasks involving summarization, 
synth esis, and creation. They note that it struggles to 
comprehend questions accurately and lacks the ability to 
utilize knowledge effectively to generate appropriate 
solutions. In some instances, ChatGPT may even create non -
existent rules or equations to produ ce solutions. Additionally, 
ChatGPT lacks a profound understanding of the underlying 
concepts of its responses, and its answers may not always be 
trustworthy, traceable, or verifiable.  
In their study, Khan et al. [18] explored various medical 
education app lications that could benefit from ChatGPT, 
such as creating personalized learning experiences and 
generating case studies. Additionally, the authors highlighted 
the potential of ChatGPT for clinical management purposes, 
such as documentation and decision s upport. Jianning Li et. 
Al., in [19] authored a systematic review on ChatGPT in 
Healthcare. They note that ChatGPT's interface is designed 
for QA, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into existing 
clinical workflows, and providing real -time feedback. I n 
addition to providing direct answers to specific questions, 
ChatGPT also offers justifications for its responses. 
Interestingly, these justifications and answers sometimes 
contain novel insights and perspectives, which could inspire 
new research ideas. E ven open -ended questions can yield 
valuable information thanks to ChatGPT's unique 
capabilities. ChatGPT is not equipped to handle queries that 
require image interpretation. Unlike expert systems, 
ChatGPT lacks the ability to "reason" and the justification s it 
provides are a byproduct of its ability to predict the next 
word based on probabilities. The accuracy of ChatGPT's 
responses is heavily reliant on the quality of the data it was 
trained on, as the training data determines how ChatGPT 
responds to a giv en question. Kostick -Quenet and Gerke's in 
[20] emphasizes the importance of evaluating the real -world 
impact of ChatGPT and other language learning models 
(LLMs) to prevent any potential negative consequences 
resulting from their misuse. Although ChatGPT and other 
LLMs are innovative and revolutionary tools, their impact 
can be severely damaging if they are not used properly. 
Thus, it is crucial to assess their practical applications and 
potential risks before widespread implementation.  
According to Fauzi et al. [21], ChatGPT can play a 
significant role in enhancing student productivity in higher 
education. The authors suggest that ChatGPT can provide 
valuable resources and information, improve language skills, 
promote collaboration, enhance time management , boost 
motivation, and increase efficiency and effectiveness. 
However, they also caution that ChatGPT should not be 
viewed as a replacement for human interaction or students' 
effort in achieving their academic goals. Instead, its role 
should be considered  as a complement to these efforts. Kung 
et al. [22] conducted a study to determine if ChatGPT is 
capable of answering medical exam questions. They 
evaluated ChatGPT's performance on the US medical 
licensing exam, which includes three standardized tests tha t 
are mandatory for obtaining medical licensure in the US. The 
study excluded any questions containing visual information 
such as medical images. ChatGPT performed at a level near the passing threshold, achieving 60% accuracy without any 
specialized input from humans.  
Pardos and Bhandari [23] conducted a study to determine 
the effectiveness of ChatGPT in providing hints to students 
in elementary and intermediate Algebra topics. They found 
that 70% of the hints offered by ChatGPT led to positive 
learning ga ins for students. Basic et al. [24] conducted a 
study with nine students in the control group and nine in the 
experimental group that used ChatGPT to determine whether 
it improves essay quality. Surprisingly, the control group 
outperformed the experimental  group in most criteria, 
leading the authors to conclude that ChatGPT does not 
necessarily improve essay quality. In the field of software 
development, ChatGPT has been evaluated for its 
capabilities in tutoring and software testing. Jalil et al. [25] 
presented ChatGPT with textbook questions to evaluate its 
ability in software testing. Unfortunately, ChatGPT's 
performance in this case was not promising, as it was only 
able to provide correct answers to 37.5% of the questions.  
In a nutshell, ChatGPT is a di sruptive technology for its 
potential to fundamentally change the way academia and 
research are conducted. ChatGPT can generate personalized 
learning materials and case studies, improving the quality of 
education for students. However, there are also poten tial 
drawbacks to the use of ChatGPT in academia and research. 
There is a risk that the use of ChatGPT could lead to a loss of 
creativity and critical thinking skills, as researchers may rely 
too heavily on the tool's generated content. Additionally, 
there  are concerns around the accuracy and reliability of 
ChatGPT's responses, particularly in cases where it may 
fabricate non -existing rules or equations.  
Overall, ChatGPT represents a disruptive technology that 
has the potential to significantly alter the pa radigm for 
academia and research. While there are both potential 
benefits and drawbacks to its use, it is clear that ChatGPT 
has already begun to have a significant impact on these fields 
and is likely to continue to do so in the years to come.  
III. METHODOLOGY  
Research Question: Is there any statistical difference 
between the academic attainment level of students using 
ChatGPT to complete a programming challenge and the 
students who do not have the opportunity to do so.  
Research Design: Quasi -experimental rese arch [26] is 
typically carried out in real -world settings where it's either 
impossible or not feasible to randomly assign participants to 
groups. This type of research is commonly employed to 
assess the efficacy of a treatment or an educational 
interventio n. To ensure the comparability of the control and 
experimental groups, all students who participated in the 
study were assessed with a pre -test to determine their 
proficiency in programming concepts. Additionally, all 
students had previously completed the three -programming 
course taught at Prince Sultan University CS101, CS102, and 
CS210 courses with a minimum grade of C+.  
• CS101 - Programming I is a 4 credit hours course 
that covers topics including Java Programming Language 
Syntax, Language Structure, Fl ow control, Loops, Methods, 
Arrays, File reading and writing.  
• CS102 – Programming II is a 3 credit hours course 
covering topics such as Object -Oriented Programming in Java, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Java Collections 
Framework, Array Lists, Sets, Maps, Multi - Dimensional 
Arrays.   
• CS210 – Data Structure & Algorithms is a 3 credit 
hours course that covers Runtime analysis of Algorithms, 
Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, BST, AVL Trees, Heaps, 
Priority Queues, Sorting Algorithms, Graphs traversal 
algorithms, S hortest Path, and Minimum Spanning Trees.  
After finishing the pre -test, the students were separated 
into two groups: a control group (group A) and an 
experimental group (group B). Each group was composed of 
six teams, and each team had two members. The stu dy 
involved a total of 24 students. The purpose of this was to 
ensure that both groups were homogeneous with respect to 
academic level and pre -test scores. The intervention or 
challenge was then administered, and the post -test scores of 
the students were u sed to measure their achievement levels. 
The resulting data was collected and statistically analyzed to 
identify any significant differences in the mean scores 
between the control and experimental groups. Figure 1 
shows an overview of the research design.  
Instrumentation: The challenge is specifically crafted to 
evaluate the participants' algorithmic and programming 
capabilities, as well as their problem -solving skills. During 
the competition, teams are presented with a series of 
programming problems, each  assigned a point value based 
on its difficulty level. Teams earn points for every problem 
they solve correctly within the stipulated time limit. Notably, 
each problem in the challenge is accompanied by a set of 
hidden test -cases, with the number of earned  points 
depending on the number of test -cases a student -team can 
successfully complete. The challenge comprises six 
programming problems, each with its own statement 
outlining its requirements, input/output conditions, and limitations. To encourage efficie nt problem -solving, each 
problem has prescribed memory and CPU time limitations, 
thereby motivating students to use optimized data structures 
in their solutions.  
The challenge was conducted in a computer lab 
environment using Programming Contest Control (P C2) [32] 
environment which is widely used in ACM International 
Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Each team of 
students comprising of 2 students addressed the challenge -
problems by writing executable code that satisfies certain 
number of test cases. St udent teams were scored based on 
their performance in terms of number of successful passed 
testcases. Time taken by all teams for each problem was also 
recorded for statistical evaluation.

problems,  with the number of test -cases defined in the 
system. The time and memory requirements are also given. 
Here problems P1 -P3 are considered easy, P4 -6 increase in 
difficulty.  
Data collection process: The control panel in PC2 
provides a detailed view on stud ents scores earned, time 
spend in each problem, the number of times a student 
submitted their work, number of test -cases passed etc. In this 
 
Figure 1: Overview of research methodology  study, the results of interest were the team scores earned and 
the time taken by a team to submit their work.  
IV. RESULTS  
Table 4 shows the mean and SD for scores earned by 
groups A and B for problems P1 to P6. It is a common 
practice to breakdown numerical data in order to provide a 
visual representation that can highlight any variations in 
scores and deviations. The mean sc ore for Group B is 
significantly higher than Group A for all problems. Both 
groups had fairly similar SDs for Problems P1, P2 and P3, 
however the difference is significant for P4 – P6.  
Figure 2 shows the average team scores for group A and 
B for the challenge. Overall Group B teams score better 
compared to group A teams.  
Figure 3 shows the time taken by teams to complete th e 
challenges P1 to P6. Group A teams took more time to 
complete challenges P1 to P4. However, Group B teams took 
more time to complete challenges P5 and P6. Group A teams 
were not able to score 100% in any of P3 to P6 problems. 
Significant amount of time w as used in debugging and fixing 
errors in problems P3 and P4, consequently poor time management resulted in low scores earned in P3 -P6. Teams 
B1 to B6 used ChatGPT to help write code.  
 
Figure 2: Average team scores for group A and B  
 
Observations were made that indicated teams B2 to B5 
utilized code gener ated by ChatGPT, but faced challenges in 
passing all the test cases within the PC2 environment. This 
was due to the fact that some of the generated code was too 
lengthy and exceeded ChatGPT's output size limits, which 
resulted in truncation. As a result, m ore time was spent 
debugging the code to resolve these issues. Additionally, 
multiple queries were made to ChatGPT, leading to 
inconsistencies. On the other hand, teams B1 and B6 also 
used ChatGPT to develop their code, but they did not solely TABLE  2: PERFORMANCE OF GROUP A STUDENT TEAMS

V. DISCUSSION  
Our findings suggest that ChatGPT is remarkable in 
producing coherent and well -structured code, and proposing 
optimized solutions against the problem statement. As a 
generative model, ChatGPT generates promising outputs and 
a comprehensive explanation for students to address the 
given problem. If prompted correctly, it gives step by step 
guidance explaining the underlying algorithm to be used in 
the solution with code snippets to help understanding. 
Students prompted it to write complete code for the given 
problem, which it did, however executing this code in the 
IDE gave mixed results.  
We also identified limitations of ChatGPT in writing 
correct code/program. It faces challenges in comprehending 
questions and lacks the proficiency to utilize knowledge to 
generate accurate solutions. In some cases, the generated 
code snippet did not compile using the IDE after several 
prompts to fix the code, causing frustration. Additionally, 
inaccuracies were observed with the output of the generated 
code which led in faili ng the test -cases. This was particularly 
noticeable as the problems difficulty level increased for the 
students (P4 onwards). In addition, because of the 
restrictions on the length of the generated text, it was 
occasionally impossible to obtain the entire program. As a 
result, students had to prompt the ChatGPT multiple times to 
acquire the desired output, which led to compile errors.  
For a student, having a thorough grasp of the inner 
workings of the algorithms is unnecessary, but 
comprehending the variabl es that will influence the result is 
crucial. It is important to inquire about the corpus of data that 
was utilized to train the AI, including any omissions and 
selection criteria. Additionally, it is important to consider the 
possible implicit biases and assumptions that the tool may 
have.  
To generate the most useful content, students must be 
proficient in providing precise prompts to the AI bot. In this 
sense, large language models are comparable to search 
engines since they require appropriate prompts to  yield 
relevant results. Crafting effective prompts necessitates a 
deep understanding of the tool and the content that underlies 
the prompt, as well as critical thinking. While a basic prompt may suffice in producing the desired output, significant effort 
is required to obtain the desired outcome.  
Students from Group B were urged to copy/save prompts 
used to generate code. Some prompts used by students:  
• Write java code to address this problem (problem 
statement).  
• This code did not compile, write a bette r code.  
• This code still did not compile, fix the errors.  
• This error was generated, fix this error and re -write code.

• This code is too slow, write a faster program.

The use of AI applications such as ChatGPT directed 
towards students has tremendous pot ential in enhancing 
intelligent student support systems and individualized 
learning. ChatGPT serves as an Intelligent tutoring system 
(ITS) that can help provide customized instructions to 
enhance learning process. Figure 4 shows an example of 
tailored lea rning when the ChatGPT is prompted: “Visually 
explain how an AVL tree attains O(log n) runtime?”  
As education researchers continue to explore new 
learning models, opportunities in the field are expanding, and 
personalization is growing. With the aid of AI algorithms, 
ITSs can now imitate the support provided by a tutor, such as 
offering tailored assistance in problem -solving. It is expected 
that the advancements in big data technology and learning 
analytics will lead to a groundbreaking paradigm of adaptive , 
individualized learning.  
Typically, when innovative educational technologies are 
introduced in the classroom [27 -31], it can pose several 
challenges to the traditional teaching and learning methods. 
Managing these challenges becomes the responsibility of 
education practitioners and policymakers [33]. If left 
unaddressed, these challenges can potentially reveal 
deficiencies in pedagogical practices. In the context of 
teaching and learning programming in a computing 
curriculum, it is essential to see stud ents learn by doing and 
gain experience writing code. Our findings suggest that 
students can easily generate working code in any 
programming language of their choice using ChatGPT. In 
most cases, the code generated, executes successfully after 
several prom pts. Eventually the technology would catch up 
producing better results in fewer prompts.  
To prevent misuse of ChatGPT as a tool for learning 
programming, there are several strategies that can be 
employed:  
• Clear expectations: Educators should communicate  
clearly to students that ChatGPT is not a suitable resource 
for learning programming and should not be used for that 
purpose.  
• Encourage hands -on learning: Emphasize the importance 
of hands -on learning and encourage students to practice programming on t heir own using legitimate programming 
resources, such as textbooks, online courses, and coding 
platforms.  
• Monitor usage: Instructors need to be vigilant and keep 
an eye on how students are using ChatGPT and intervene 
if there is evidence that it is bein g used inappropriately. 
This can be done by monitoring students' online activity 
or by checking their programming work for signs of 
plagiarism or excessive reliance on external resources.  
• Assess learning outcomes: Incorporate assessments that 
test studen ts' ability to apply programming concepts and 
skills, rather than just regurgitating information. This will 
encourage students to engage in active learning and 
discourage them from relying on ChatGPT for answers.  
• Plagiarism detection tools: Moss (Measure  of Software 
Similarity) is a plagiarism detection tool developed by 
Stanford University. It is designed to detect similarities 
between programming assignments submitted by 
students, and it can be used to help instructors identify 
cases of potential plagia rism. There are several other 
tools that can be used to getect plagiarism including 
JPlag, Codequiry etc.  
• Interviews can be a useful tool for detecting plagiarism in 
cases where software tools may not be effective, such as 
when the student has modified c ode to make it appear 
original. However, this method requires significant time 
and effort on the part of the instructor and may not be feasible for large classes or assignments with many 
students.  
VI. CONCLUSIONS  
The integration of AI in higher education teaching, 
learnin g, and assessment, presents both opportunities and 
challenges. An experimental study was conducted to assess 
the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for solving programming 
problems. The study involved 24 students who were divided 
into two groups control and ex perimental. According to the 
findings, the group that utilized ChatGPT in the experiment 
performed better than the control group, achieving higher 
scores in less time. However, the experimental group was not 
able to achieve perfect scores due to inaccuraci es or 
inconsistencies in the code generated by ChatGPT.  
Overall, it is important to create a learning environment 
that emphasizes the importance of active, hands -on learning 
and discourages students from relying on external resources 
such as ChatGPT for t heir programming education. As AI 
tools for solving programming challenges continue to 
emerge and improve in accuracy, students may be tempted to 
cheat if they do not fully understand the value of their 
learning. It is the responsibility of educators to cl early 
explain the significance of their work and the benefits of 
learning through practice. At the institutional level, academic 
integrity policies and honor codes should be revised to 
address the use of AI tools. Clear and simple guidelines for 
the proper  use of language models in teaching and learning 
should be developed, and consequences for cheating should 
 
 
Figure 4: A sample of tailored response to a query  be clearly outlined. Faculty should be trained to adopt AI 
tools to augment their teaching practices. Additionally, 
students should receive training on academic integrity to 
ensure they fully understand the importance of maintaining 
ethical standards in their work.
