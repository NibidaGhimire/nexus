We present here a formalism based on time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) to 
describe characteristics of both intra- and inter-valley excitons in semiconductors, the latter of 
which had remained a challenge. Through the usage of an appropriate exchange-correlation kernel 
(nanoquanta), we trace the energy difference between the intra- and inter-valley dark excitons 
in  monolayer (1L) WSe 2 to the domination of the exchange part in the exchange-correlation 
energies of these states. Furthermore, our calculated transition contribution maps establish the 
momentum resolved weights of the electron-hole excitations in both bright and dark excitons 
thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of excitonic properties of 1L WSe 2. We find 
that the states consist of hybridized excitations around the corresponding valleys which leads to 
brightening of the dark excitons, i.e., significantly decreasing their lifetime which is reflected in 
the PL spectrum. Using many-body perturbation theory, we calculate the phonon contribution to 
the energy bandgap and the linewidths of the excited electrons, holes and (bright) exciton to find 
that as the temperature increases the bandgap significantly decreases, while the linewidths increase. 
Our work paves for describing the ultrafast charge dynamics of transition metal dichalcogenide 
within an ab initio framework.

 1. Introduction 
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class of two-dimensional (2D) 
materials with unique, most notably optical, properties that have drawn considerable interest in 
recent years.1,2 Compared to the case of the bulk, monolayer TMDs exhibit a direct band gap at K 
points in the Brillouin zone with highly efficient luminescence.3,4 The systems also demonstrate  
high electron mobility and room-temperature current on/off ratio, with potential field-effect 
transistor applications.5 As one of most actively studied TMDs, it is known that 1L WSe 2, a three-
atom thick system, displaying a pronounced absorption region6 and a direct band gap at two time-
reversal valleys (K, Kᇱ) in the Brillouin zone.7-10 Due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the bottom of 
the conduction and top of the valence band are each split into two sub bands with opposite spins. 
The valence band splitting is wide, in the hundred meV range, while that of the bottom of 
conduction band is in the tenths of meV.9 The splitting of conduction band, in particular, creates 
an ideal environment for forming intra-valley bright and intra- and inter-valley dark excitons 
(shown in Figure 1). The properties of these excitons can be tuned by changing valley polarization 
and by the interaction between the different (orbital, spin, valley) degrees of freedom,11,12 giving 
rise to exotic effects such as valley optical selection rules13. The intravalley bright (opposite spin 
for electron and hole) or dark (same spin for electron and hole) excitons consist of the electron-
hole pairs from the same K valley, constrained by the spin orientation, with the bright exciton 
giving the major contribution to the photoluminescence (PL). On the other hand, the intervalley 
dark (opposite spin for electron and hole) exciton is composed of electrons and holes from K and 
Kᇱ valleys.12-14 Because the recombination of the electron and hole from different valleys is 
forbidden by momentum conservation law, the emission from (phonon-assisted) recombination of 
the intervalley dark exciton is very low. In other words, the lifetime of dark excitons is much longer 
than that of the bright ones.15,16  
Gate- and magnetic-field based measurements show PL peaks from both bright and dark excitons, 
with almost measurement-independent, 16meV, difference in energy for the intra- and inter-valley 
dark excitons.17 In a combined experimental+theoretical study using a semiquantitative approach 
in which wavefunctions and energies from DFT were used as input for many-body analysis, Liu 
et al.18 showed that the binding energy of the intervalley dark exciton is 10 meV smaller than that 
of the intravalley dark exciton because of the difference in the Coulomb exchange energy as a 
result of different orientations of the electron and hole in these two systems (for intra- and 3 
 intervalley exciton state transitions, see work [19]). Similarly, Yang et al. found experimentally 
that intervalley exciton has smaller binding energy by ~ 9 meV.20 The dark excitonic states are 
seen in the PL spectrum, and the reason for the rather high signatures of the intra- and inter-valley 
dark exciton states in the PL despite a low recombination probability, is their relatively large 
population.20

represent the opposite spin polarizations (depicted by the arrows) at time-reversal K and Kᇱ points 
in BZ. 
 
Available first-principles studies of excitons and the optical spectra in 1L WSe 2, mostly based 
on the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) approach,21-23 find the binding energy of the direct 
(bright) exciton to be in reasonable agreement with experiments.24 Despite this remarkable 
achievement, the GW-BSE  methodology is more suitable to calculations of direct (intravalley) 
excitons. Furthermore, the optical absorption of extended systems studied by the many-body BSE 
theory is computationally demanding, requiring calculations for an enormous number of k-points 
to solve the two-particle Green’s functions.25 There is thus an urgent and economic need in 
theoretical ab initio efforts for developing computationally efficient techniques for reliable 
calculations of both indirect (intervalley) dark excitons and the usual bright excitons. As we 
document below, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one such scheme. 
 As in TDDFT one solves an effective one-particle problem, it is technically much simpler than 
methods such as BSE. It is a theory of one-particle density that depends on one space vector and 
one time variable. Thus, the solution can be obtained in a feasible manner, provided an appropriate 
4 
 exchange-correlation (XC) potential is available. Formally, the linear-response TDDFT used for 
calculation of excited states incorporates many-body effects into the dynamical exchange-
correlation kernel 𝑓௫௖(𝐫,𝑡,𝐫ᇱ;𝑡ᇱ)=𝛿𝑣௫௖(𝐫,𝑡)𝛿𝑛(𝐫ᇱ,𝑡′)⁄ , where 𝑣௫௖(𝐫,𝑡) denotes the 
corresponding time-dependent exchange-correlation potential and 𝑛(𝐫ᇱ,𝑡) is the charge density. 
The standard approximations for 𝑣௫௖ (local density or generalized gradient form) typically predict 
the ground-states properties of extended system quite reliably, but fail to describe excitonic effects 
in the optical and energy-loss spectra.26 Moreover, 𝑓௫௖ is often defined either by empirical 
parameters (such as the long-range (LR) kernel)27 or by some physically-motivated but not quite 
universal approximations (e.g., the exact-exchange kernel)28. What is needed is an “exact” 
(parameter-free) and technically simple 𝑓௫௖ to accurately study excitonic and multi-excitonic 
effects in extended systems, such as two dimensional TMDs. From this point of view, the 
nanoquanta kernel derived from the BSE approach has an acceptable computational cost, as it 
employs the one-loop approximation for the susceptibilities, and has proven to be suitable for 
selected systems.29-31   
In this work, we focus on describing the fundamental properties of intra and intervalley bright 
and dark excitons by using the nanoquanta kernel. We solve the TDDFT problem in the density-
matrix representation and obtain results for the excitonic binding energies for the intra-valley 
bright and intra and intervalley dark excitons in 1L WSe 2. We also calculate the transition 
contribution maps to find the composition of these excitons in terms of the free electron-hole 
excitations. Finally, by adding phonon effects into the theory in the form of many-body 
perturbation theory we calculate the temperature-dependence of the electron and hole excitation  
energies and lifetimes of electrons, holes and excitons.  
 
2. Methodology 
2.1 Theory 
TDDFT for intervalley excitons 
The Casida equation formalism for TDDFT allows one to calculate the eigenenergies and 
eigenstates of the system by solving the corresponding eigenproblem.32 However, so far a TDDFT 
formalism for describing non-conserving-momenta transitions, including inter-valley excitons,  is 
absent. To derive TDDFT equation for the intervalley bound states, we begin with the time-
dependent Kohn-Sham equation33-35: 5 
 𝑖డஏ𝒌ೡ(𝒓,௧)
డ௧=𝐻(𝒓,𝑡)Ψ𝒌௩(𝒓,𝑡),                                                 (1) 
where 𝒌 is the wave vector and the system Hamiltonian is given by 
𝐻[𝑛](𝒓,𝑡)= −𝛁మ
ଶ௠+𝑉ு[𝑛](𝒓,𝑡)+𝑉௑஼[𝑛](𝒓,𝑡)+𝑒𝒓𝑬(𝑡),                          (2) 
which includes the kinetic (first), Hartree (second), and XC (third) potential terms, as well as 
external electric field part (the last term). The self-consistent electron density is used to solve Eq. 
(1): 
𝑛(𝑟,𝑡)=∑หΨ𝒌௟(𝒓,𝑡)หଶ
௟,|𝒌|ழ௞ಷ,                                               (3) 
where l is combined band and spin index. 
To derive the exciton eigenenergy equation it is convenient to use the density-matrix 
formalism33-35 in which one expands Ψ𝒌௩(𝒓,𝑡) in the basis of the wavefunctions 𝜓𝒌௟(𝒓) obtained 
from DFT: 
Ψ𝒌௩(𝒓,𝑡)=∑𝑐𝒌௟(𝑡)𝜓𝒌௟
௟ୀ௩,௖    ,                                                 (4) 
where 𝑐𝒌௟ are time-dependent coefficients. From Eqs. (1) and (4) we thus obtain: 
𝑖డ௖𝒌೘
డ௧=∑𝐻𝒌𝒒௠௟𝑐𝒒௟
௟ୀ௩,௖;𝒒   ,                                                        (5) 
where 
𝐻𝒌𝒒௠௟(𝑡)=∫𝜓𝒌௠∗(𝒓)𝐻[𝑛](𝒓,𝑡)𝜓𝒒௟(𝒓)𝑑𝒓                                    (6) 
are matrix elements of the Hamiltonian. 
Instead of solving Eq. (5), it is convenient to solve the equation for the density matrix 
𝜌𝒌𝒒௟௠(𝑡)=𝑐𝒌௟(𝑡)𝑐𝒒௠∗(𝑡),                                                    (7) 
that contains more physical information such as the state occupancies which are given by its 
diagonal elements, while electron transitions (polarizations, including excitonic states) are given 
by the non-diagonal elements. The density matrix satisfies the Liouville equation 
𝑖డఘ𝒌𝒒೗೘(௧)
డ௧=[𝐻,𝜌]𝒌𝒒௠௟(𝑡)≡∑ቀ𝐻𝒌𝒑௟௡(𝑡)𝜌𝒑𝒒௡௠(𝑡)−𝜌𝒌𝒑௟௡(𝑡)𝐻𝒑𝒒௡௠(𝑡)ቁ ௡,௣ .                  (8) 
The four types of the matrix elements (for valence 𝑣 and conduction 𝑐 bands): 𝜌𝒌𝒌௩௩(𝑡), 𝜌𝒌𝒒௖௩(𝑡), 
𝜌𝒌𝒒௩௖(𝑡) and 𝜌𝒌𝒌௖௖(𝑡)  are not all independent, since by definition: 
 1 =∫หΨ𝒌௟(𝒓,𝑡)หଶ=𝜌𝒌𝒌௩௩(𝑡)+𝜌𝒌𝒌௖௖(𝑡),𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜌𝒌𝒒௖௩(𝑡)=𝜌𝒒𝒌௩௖(𝑡).                                          (9) 6 
 We choose 𝜌𝒌𝒒௖௩(𝑡) and 𝜌𝒌𝒌௖௖(𝑡) as the two independent matrix elements, the equations of motion 
for which are 
𝑖డఘ𝒌𝒒೎ೡ(௧)
డ௧=𝐻𝒌𝒑௖௖(𝑡)𝜌𝒑𝒒௖௩(𝑡)−𝜌𝒌𝒑௖௩(𝑡)𝐻𝒑𝒒௩௩(𝑡)+ቀ1−𝜌𝒒𝒒௖௖(𝑡)−𝜌𝒌𝒌௖௖(𝑡)ቁ𝐻𝒌𝒒௖௩(𝑡),      (10) 
డఘ𝒌𝒌೎೎(௧)
డ௧= −2𝐼𝑚ቀ𝐻𝒑𝒌௩௖(𝑡)𝜌𝒌𝒑௖௩(𝑡)ቁ.                                                (11) 
The above equations describe dynamics of the system.  
Since we are interested in the excitonic eigenstates lets us derive the eigenequation by 
linearizing the polarization equation (10): 
𝑖𝜕𝜌𝒌𝒒௖௩(𝑡)
𝜕𝑡=൫𝜀𝒌௖−𝜀𝒒௩൯𝜌𝒌𝒒௖௩(𝑡)+෍ න𝐹𝒌𝒑𝒒𝒒௖௩௖௩(𝑡,𝑡ᇱ)𝜌𝒒𝒒௖௩(𝑡ᇱ)𝑑𝑡ᇱ௧

where the function 
𝐹𝒌𝒑𝒒𝒒௟௠௔௕(𝑡,𝑡ᇱ)=∬𝑑𝒓𝑑𝒓ᇱ𝜓𝒌௠∗(𝒓)𝜓𝒑௟(𝒓)ቆଵ
|𝒓ି𝒓ᇲ|𝛿(𝑡− 𝑡ᇱ)+𝑓௫௖(𝒓,𝒓ᇱ,𝑡,𝑡ᇱ)ቇ𝜓𝒒௔∗(𝒓′)𝜓𝒒௕(𝒓′) (13) 
describes scattering of two charges from states with momenta 𝒌, 𝒑 to those with momenta 𝒒 and 
𝒒. These elements are defined by the XC kernel 𝑓௫௖(𝒓,𝒓ᇱ,𝑡,𝑡ᇱ). In Eq.(12),  𝜀𝒌௖ and 𝜀𝒒௩ are the 
spectra of the conduction and valence bands obtained from DFT. The excitonic states are described 
by the elements 𝜌𝒌𝒑௖௩(𝑡). In the spin-dependent case, for the spin triplet excitations the products of 
two functions 𝜓𝒌௠∗(𝒓)𝜓𝒒௕(𝒓ᇱ)  and 𝜓𝒑௟(𝒓)𝜓𝒒௔∗(𝒓ᇱ)cossresponding to such transitions (like in the 
case of intervalley dark excitons, see below) in Eq. (13) have to be substituted by an antisymmetric 
combinations, e.g. 𝜓𝒌௠∗(𝒓)𝜓𝒒௕(𝒓ᇱ)→ଵ
√ଶቀ𝜓𝒌௠∗(𝒓)𝜓𝒒௕(𝒓ᇱ)−𝜓𝒌௠∗(𝒓ᇱ)𝜓𝒒௕(𝒓)ቁ, and similar for the 
second pair. In the Tamm-Dancoff approximation, 𝜌𝒒𝒒௩௖(𝑡) (de-excitation) terms can be neglected 
and the resulting Casida equation becomes: 
൫𝜔−𝜀𝒌௖+𝜀𝒒௩൯𝜌𝒌𝒒௖௩(𝜔)−∑𝐹𝒌𝒑𝒒𝒒௖௩௖௩(𝜔)𝜌𝒒𝒒௖௩(𝜔)𝒒ழ௞ಷ−𝑑⃗𝒌𝒒௖௩𝐸ሬ⃗(𝜔)= 0.           (14) 
Solution of the above equation yields the eigenenergies of the excited system, including 
exciton binding energies, when 𝜔< Δ௚ (Δ௚ is bandgap). Equation (14) is quite general, since it 
can describe intra- ( 𝒌=𝒒) and inter-valley ( 𝒌≠𝒒 ) transitions. This is a generalization of the 
density-matrix TDDFT equation for excitons [34] for the case when the electron and hole have 7 
 different momenta. Equation for the standard intra-valley excitons has been analyzed in previous 
works.33-35 
We note that equation (14) for the inter-valley excitons can be solved separately for the 
diagonal and non-diagonal elements. Thus, one needs to find first the solution for the diagonal 
part  ρ෤୯୯ୡ୴(ω) that satisfies the equation 
൫𝜔−𝜀𝒌௖+𝜀𝒒௩൯𝜌෤𝒌𝒌௖௩(𝜔)−∑𝐹𝒌𝒌𝒒𝒒௖௩௖௩(𝜔)𝜌෤௤௤௖௩(𝜔) 𝒒ழ௞ಷ−𝑑⃗𝒌𝒌௖௩𝐸ሬ⃗(𝜔)= 0.            (15) 
The solution of the above equation is 
𝜌෤𝒒𝒒௖௩(𝜔)=෍𝐵𝒌𝒒ିଵ
𝒒ழ௞ಷ𝑑⃗𝒌𝒌௖௩𝐸ሬ⃗(𝜔),                                                   (16)  
where 
𝐵𝒌𝒒(𝜔)=൫𝜔−𝜀𝒌௖+𝜀𝒒௩+𝑖𝛿൯𝛿𝒌𝒒−𝐹𝒌𝒌𝒒𝒒௖௩௖௩(𝜔)                                (17) 
and 𝑖𝛿 is a small imaginary part. 
Substitution of equation (16) into equation (14) gives the equation for the inter-valley 
polarization 𝜌𝒌𝒒௖௩(𝜔). 
Next, one can use the solution of the resulting equation to analyze the peaks in the absorption 
spectrum 𝐴(𝜔)~−ଵ
หாሬ⃗(ఠ)ห𝐼𝑚𝜌𝒌𝒒௖௩(𝜔) to find the intervalley exciton peak that corresponds to the

i.e., a pole of 𝜌𝒌𝒒௖௩(𝜔) below the gap which gives rise to bound states. 
 
XC kernels 
An important aspect of the above derivation is the XC kernel. In this work, we consider three 
different XC kernels: 
1. Local kernel36: this is simply the phenomenological contact interaction  
𝑓௑஼௟௢௖௔௟(𝒓,𝒓ᇱ)= −𝛼𝛿(𝒓−𝒓ᇱ),                                                         (19)   
where 𝛼 is a parameter describing the strength of the TDDFT local electron-hole 
attraction 
2. Long range (LR) kernel36: it is given by 8

Effect of electron-phonon interaction 
As is the case with DFT calculations of system energetics, the above derivations are valid at very 
low (zero) temperature. Here, we include effects of the ambient temperature through electron-
phonon and exciton-phonon interactions which provide temperature dependencies of the bandgap 
and the excitonic line width (inverse lifetime). Using second-order perturbation theory to include 
electron-phonon interaction in the calculated electronic band energy 𝐸𝒌௟(𝑇)37 leads to

2.2 Computational details 
The DFT Kohn-Sham wavefunctions and eigenenergies were generated by the code 
QUANTUM ESPRESSO43 and served as the input for the TDDFT code BEE (Binding Energy of 
Excitons)35 developed in our group to obtain the associated fundamental parameters and solutions 
of the exciton eigenenergy equation. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) XC potential within the 
generalized gradient approximation (GGA)44 was used in the DFT calculations. We used the norm-
conserving pseudopotential to avoid inappropriate normalization of pseudo-wave functions.45 A 
cutoff energy of 70 Ry and a (12×12×1)  k-point mesh in the 2D Brillouin zone (BZ) were used 
to optimize the crystal structure.46 The 1L WSe 2 is modeled using a cell with (1×1) periodicity 
added to the vacuum slab ~12 Å along the c direction (shown in Figure 2). The optimized lattice 
constant 𝑎 was found to be 3.357 Å. Further, the band structure calculations in the presence of 
SOC were performed with fully relativistic  pseudopotentials.47 The calculations to generate the 10 
 wavefunction with SOC were performed with  (18×18×1)  k-point grid in the BZ. Density 
functional perturbation theory (DFPT)48 was used to calculate the dispersion of phonons and the 
electron-phonon scattering probabilities across the BZ using QUANTUM ESPRESSO. The 
phonon frequency calculations were converged for residual force less than 0.00001 eV/ Å-1.

3. Results and discussions 
3.1 Band structure and exciton binding energy 
The calculated band structure of 1L WSe 2 is shown in Figure 3. Although the PBE potential 
underestimates the  bandgap of 1L WSe 2 (1.46 eV which is less than the experimental value of 
2.02eV,49 our result regarding splitting of the bottom of the conduction band (~38.6 meV) owing 
to SOC are in good agreement with experimental observations and theoretical predictions.9,50 
Functionals that account for screening effects, such as the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid 
functional, provide bandgap that agrees with the experimental data,51 but with a high computational 
cost.  Since the calculated binding energies (of the exciton) with respect to the bottom of sub-bands 
should not be significantly sensitive to the value of the bandgap, we have stayed with the PBE 
functional for our DFT calculations.  
For further computational feasibility, we use a three-band approximation, which includes the 
top of valence band (V1) and two sub-bands of bottom of conduction band (C1, C2) split by the 
SOC effect, in the TDDFT calculation for the binding energy of excitons.  Note that TDDFT results 
for the exciton binding energies are less sensitive to the number of used bands as compared to the 
BSE approach.52 Figure 3 also displays the momentum-resolution of the three bands across the BZ. 
The highest level of the top of the valence band is located at K and Kᇱ points, similarly the lowest 
levels of the conduction bands are also at these  points, i.e. the system is a direct-gap semiconductor.

The theoretical values of the exciton binding energy in 1L WSe 2 still lack trustworthy 
consistency in the community. The DFT-based method53 and GW-BSE calculations24 predict 
exciton binding energy of approximately 500 meV and 340 meV, respectively, while the 
experimental observations, from in situ optical absorption and PL spectroscopy, suggest that the 
corresponding energy is 317 meV.54 Optical reflectance and spectroscopic data infer the binding 
energy to be about 412 meV in suspended 1L WSe 2.55 We first summarize our calculated exciton 
12 
 binding energies using the local and long range kernels in Table I and Figure 4. As one can see 
from Figure 4a, to achieve the experimentally estimated binding energy ~ 400 meV we need 𝛼=
191 for the contact local kernel, which is an unreasonably high value. It is also clear that the 
exciton binding energy is very sensitive to the parameter 𝛼. Notably, the binding energy is very 
weak if local potential is approximately regarded as “averaged LDA”. Similarly, the results for the 
exciton binding energy depends dramatically on the parameter 𝜀 in the LR potentials, as shown in 
Figure 4b. The screening parameter 𝜀 is approximately 450 to obtain the experimental value of 
400 meV for exciton binding energy. Unfortunately, a realistic screening parameter (~3) cannot 
produce binding energy that is consistent with the experimental value. Although the calculations 
of binding energy using local and LR potentials do not include SOC effect, the fact that the 
obtained results are sensitive to the values of the parameters and one cannot reproduce 
experimental data with reasonable values of these parameters, suggests that these kernels cannot 
be used to describe excitons 1L WSe 2.

 In order to obtain more physical results for the intra- and intervalley excitons we thus turn to 
the nanoquanta kernel, which takes into account rather accurately screening in the framework of 
many-body perturbation theory, and the rest of the computational procedure is parameter-free. In 
the corresponding kernel calculation, the simple ground states KS potential, such as PBE, can be 
applied instead of the more complex one in practice. The binding energies of intra- and intervalley 
excitons calculated with the nanoquanta kernel are listed in the Table II which shows that our 
values are slightly smaller than those from the experimental data. Some of discrepancy could be 
attributed to the three-band model that we have used. For bench marking our results, we calculated 
the binding energy of intravalley bright exciton using the GW-BSE-SOC method. Since this 
method requires a dense k-mesh and a good number of bands, a (36×36×1)  k-point mesh with 
10 bands (6 valence bands and 4 conduction bands) were employed. Unfortunately, such a 
procedure produced a binding energy of only 70 meV for the intravalley bright exciton. 
Additionally, we notice that the binding energy of bright exciton with SOC differs significantly 
from that without it. This difference depends mainly on the distinct curvatures of band edges in 
the SOC and non-SOC cases, which gives rise to differences in the effective masses of carriers.  
To shed light on  direct and indirect optical transitions, we turn to a comparison of the 
properties of the intra- and intervalley dark excitons. As shown in Figure 5, intravalley  dark 
exciton (D0) is composed of electron and hole with same spin, while intervalley dark exciton ( I0) 
consists of electron and hole with opposite spin. Electron-hole Coulomb interaction is naturally 
present in both D0 and I0. On the other hand, electron-hole exchange interaction contributes only 
to the energy of I0 (electron and hole have opposite spins, i.e. electrons from the conduction and 
valence bands have the same spin) and thus leads to the energy splitting between D0 and I0. We 
find this splitting using the nanoquanta kernel to be ~ 22 meV in our calculations, as seen in Table 
II, in reasonable agreement with experimental observations (9~16 meV).17-20 Our calculations of 
the difference of the exchange parts of the energy of the intra- and inter-valley dark excitons, 
obtained with the nanoquanta potential, also support this result.  Namely, we have calculated the 
exchange energy related to the inter-valley dark  exciton by using an approximate formula, valid 
for two interacting particles, −ଵ

𝑓௑஼(𝑟⃗−𝑟⃗ᇱ) is the real-space Fourier transform of the nanoquanta kernel in Eq. (21) (this energy

with the above Casida equation result of 22meV.

3.2 Transition contribution maps 
For a deeper understanding of the properties of the dark excitons, we calculated momentum-
resolved weights of the electron-hole transitions for each excitonic state. This was done by 
calculating the eigenvectors from Eq. (14) and plotting the transition contribution map - square of 
15 
 the modulus of the components of eigenvectors (that correspond to different momenta). The 
obtained  transition contribution maps (Figure 6), that show contribution of different “DFT-state 
excitations” to the excitonic transitions, facilitate a better understanding of excitonic states. In this 
map, in the xy-plane we show the momentum of the electron excited state, while the hole excited 
state is assumed to be at the K-point. Our findings reveal that electron-hole transitions consist 
dominantly of states nearby the K and Kᇱ valleys in the case of intravalley excitons (both 
intravalley bright and dark excitations), while the excitations from the adjacent area of K and Kᇱ 
also contribute to the optical transition. For the intervalley electron-hole excitations, the primary 
contributions of excitonic hybridizations are from the areas around K and Kᇱ valleys. Surprisingly, 
there are additional contributions from the Γ point.

excitons. The final momenta of electrons are given in the xy-plane and the final momenta of holes

3.3 Energy shifts and lifetimes due to charge-phonon interaction 
Inclusion of electron-phonon interactions, as summarized in Section 2.1, allows calculation 
of the temperature dependencies of the excitation energy by documenting the shifts in the position 
of the inter-band and exciton transition peaks. In particular, by using Eq. (26) we find that the 
bandgap shrinks from 1.46 eV to 1.396 eV (decrease by 64 meV) as temperature increases from 
0K to 300 K (Figure 7c). The top of valence band lifts and bottom of conduction band drops 
simultaneously in this temperature range. The corresponding variation of ~100meV in electron 
16 
 and hole energies at 300 K are well in agreement with the experimental observations.56 In this 
work, we did not calculate change of the energy of different types of excitons with temperature, 
which is a separate computationally challenging project. We analyzed the phonon part of lifetime 
of the electron, hole (from the inverse of the imaginary part of self-energy (24)) and bright exciton 
(equal to inverse of the corresponding line broadening (27)). We found that this quantity also 
changes significantly with temperature (Figures 7d and 7e). These results point to the need to 
include phonon effects to describe experimental spectra of the system.

4. Conclusions 
In this work, we have formulated a density-matrix TDDFT approach to examine the properties of 
intervalley excitons in 1L WSe 2. We applied different XC kernels to analyze the excitonic 
properties of the system, and found that the nanoquanta kernel provides physically meaningful 
results. This TDDFT approach is computationally much more feasible as compared to the BSE 
method.  The exchange energy-splitting of the energies of intra- and intervalley dark excitons 
obtained by the nanoquanta kernel is approximately 22 meV, which is in good agreement with the 
experimental results.  The TDDFT calculations of the transition contribution map for the 
excitations in 1L WSe 2 show that the electron-hole transitions near the K and Kᇱ valleys mostly 
contribute to the formation of intravalley excitonic states. Surprisingly, in the inter-valley exciton 
case states around Γ-point also give a significant contribution.   
 
We have also applied second-order perturbation theory to evaluate the contribution of electron-
phonon scattering to the temperature-induced shift of the bands and of the bandgap, as well as to 
calculate the electron-, hole- and bright exciton lifetimes. We found that these quantities depend 
significantly on temperature, and that our results for the bandgap shift are in agreement with 
available experimental data. These results suggest that phonons cannot be neglected in analysis of 
the optical spectra of the system. The formalism presented here is ready to be applied to describe 
18 
 systems with many (orbital, spin, valley, lattice vibration) degrees of freedom in TMDs and other 
materials.
