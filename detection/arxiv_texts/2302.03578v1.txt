Abstract
Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) Ô¨Årst map raw input(s)
to a vector of human-deÔ¨Åned concepts, before using this vec-
tor to predict a Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation. We might therefore ex-
pect CBMs capable of predicting concepts based on distinct
regions of an input. In doing so, this would support human
interpretation when generating explanations of the model‚Äôs
outputs to visualise input features corresponding to concepts.
The contribution of this paper is threefold: Firstly, we expand
on existing literature by looking at relevance both from the
input to the concept vector, conÔ¨Årming that relevance is dis-
tributed among the input features, and from the concept vec-
tor to the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation where, for the most part, the Ô¨Å-
nal classiÔ¨Åcation is made using concepts predicted as present.
Secondly, we report a quantitative evaluation to measure the
distance between the maximum input feature relevance and
the ground truth location; we perform this with the tech-
niques, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), Integrated
Gradients (IG) and a baseline gradient approach, Ô¨Ånding LRP
has a lower average distance than IG. Thirdly, we propose us-
ing the proportion of relevance as a measurement for explain-
ing concept importance.
1 Introduction
Humans build mental models which are internal represen-
tations of an object‚Äôs internal mechanics. These are used
to predict an object‚Äôs future states and aid in interactions
(Johnson-Laird 1986; Craik 1943; Halasz and Moran 1983;
Norman 1983). If a human is unable to build an accurate
representation of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) decision
boundaries, the human could be misled to either accept mis-
classiÔ¨Åcations or disregard its output entirely. Explainable
artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence (XAI) techniques aim to aid humans
in building mental models of DNNs. One XAI technique is
to use saliency maps , a tool which highlights features of an
input which were relevant to a prediction.
Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) (Koh et al. 2020)
seek to enable richer human-machine interaction by training
a DNN to predict a vector of human-deÔ¨Åned concepts before
using this vector to predict a Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation. CBMs have
the potential of performing a task in a similar way to hu-
mans, whilst also enabling interpretability of their learned
representations. For instance, to identify a bird, a human
may Ô¨Årst recognise parts of the bird such as the colour andsize, before using this information for bird identiÔ¨Åcation. As
the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation uses the predicted concept vector, a
human user will be able to modify the concept vector, re-
ferred to as intervening , and add or remove concepts to in-
spect changes to the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation.
Despite the concept vector output, CBMs are unable to
explain what input features lead to concept predictions, or
which concepts contribute to the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation. An XAI
study for CBMs (Margeloiu et al. 2021) used saliency maps
and suggests that CBMs do not learn concepts as humans
would expect, but instead attribute relevance to the entire in-
put, and not to distinct regions. The authors however only
looked at saliency maps for concepts and not the Ô¨Ånal clas-
siÔ¨Åcation and did not indicate what the models may be learn-
ing for concept predictions. In this paper we position XAI,
and in particular saliency maps, as a technique to present the
relevancy behind a CBM prediction, both concept and Ô¨Ånal
classiÔ¨Åcation and thus make the model reasoning accessible
to a human.
Our research focuses on producing explanations for
CBMs targeted for use by domain experts. For this rea-
son, we use CBMs with Layer-wise Relevance Propagation
(LRP) (Bach et al. 2015) to explore relevancy attributed,
from the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation to the concept vector and from
the concept vector to the input as relevance can be attributed
to groups of input features instead of on a pixel-by-pixel ba-
sis (Samek et al. 2021). Despite the primary use of LRP in
this paper, the techniques described apply to other gradient-
based attribution methods such as Integrated Gradients (IG)
(Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan 2017) which we also used to
compare concept vector to input saliency maps. Our code is
publicly available1.
2 Background
2.1 Concept Bottleneck Models
CBMs can be given in the form f(g(x))where the function
grefers to the prediction of concepts ^cusing the input xand
the function fis the prediction of the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation y
with the input ^c.
Given the training set fx(i);y(i);c(i)gn
i=1where we are
provided with a set of inputs x2Rd, corresponding targets

bottleneck-models
1arXiv:2302.03578v1  [cs.AI]  7 Feb 2023y2 Y and vectors of kconceptsc2Rk. A CBM maps the
input space to the concept space g:Rd!Rkand maps
concepts to Ô¨Ånal targets f:Rk! Y . This is such that the
Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation is made using only concept predictions.
CBMs can be trained in three ways: independent ,sequen-
tialandjoint. With independent training, each model part is
trained separately, whereas the sequential method trains the
model parts one after another and joint trains them together
in an end-to-end fashion.
In this paper, we refer to the model part predicting cas
x!cand the model part predicting yasc!y.
2.2 Layer-wise Relevance Propagation
LRP (Bach et al. 2015) is an explanation technique that
propagates a prediction backwards through a network until
a deÔ¨Åned layer or input is reached, following a set of rules.
Primarily, the network output is conserved and is only redis-
tributed to the neurons of the previous layer. The total value
propagated does not change. The use of alternative rules
adds Ô¨Çexibility for LRP implementation (Montavon et al.
2019). These include the basic rule (LRP-0), Epsilon rule
(LRP-) and Alpha Beta Rule (LRP- ) (Bach et al. 2015).
Rules can be applied in a composite manner to overcome the
shortcomings of any single rule.
LRP is considered to have an advantage over the re-
lated IG method (Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan 2017) in that
IG tends to produce very Ô¨Åne-grained pixel-wise mappings
whereas LRP tends to group relevance to features from the
input (Samek et al. 2021). As we are interested in mapping
relevance attributed to concepts, and concepts occupy dis-
tinct regions in input images, this makes LRP an appealing
choice.
3 Setup
3.1 Models and Dataset
Our models were trained with the same modiÔ¨Åcations of the
CUB-200 2011 (CUB) dataset (Wah et al. 2011) as (Koh
et al. 2020) which used class-level concepts with 11,788 bird
images covering 200 classiÔ¨Åcations and 112 concepts.
We trained four models, one for each of the independent
and sequential methods and two for the joint method (with
and without a sigmoid activation between the two model
parts). For the x!cmodel part, we used a VGG-16 archi-
tecture with batch normalisation (Simonyan and Zisserman
2015), pre-trained on ImageNet. The c!ymodel part is a
single fully connected layer. Model performance on the test
dataset is shown in Table 1.
3.2 LRP ConÔ¨Åguration
For thex!cmodel we use similar LRP rules to (Montavon
et al. 2019). These rules are: LRP- , where= 1 and
= 0, for the Ô¨Årst seven convolutional layers of the model
from the input, LRP- for the next six convolutional layers
and LRP-0 for the top three linear layers. LRP-0 is used for
thec!ymodel.
We used a method detailed by (Taylor et al. 2020), chang-
ing modality for concepts, to calculate the proportion of rel-
evance for each concept, and thus the percentage each con-Training methodClassiÔ¨Åcation

Table 1: Models Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation top-1 accuracy and con-
cept binary accuracy
cept contributed towards the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation. This is pos-
sible because LRP conserves relevancy. As each concept is
a single value we do not need to account for imbalance in
concept proportions.
By calculating the contribution of concepts for the Ô¨Ånal
classiÔ¨Åcation, a human may be able to focus on the most in-
Ô¨Çuential concepts to a Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation and, if intervention
is required, which concepts they may wish to intervene on.
4 Results
Figure 1 shows the relevance from the concept layer back
to the input for a range of concepts which a human would
expect to map to distinct regions of the input. Regardless
of the training method used, the saliency maps indicate that
the models have not learned a mapping of distinct regions
in the input to concepts. Relevancy is generally distributed
over the entire bird although an observation with our models
is the eyes of the bird appears to be the most common feature
to be highly positive or negatively relevant.
Concepts with similar predictions also appear to share
similar saliency maps. This is evident in Figure 1 with
the independent and sequential models and concepts
hascrown color::brown and haswing shape::pointed-
wings which have a predicted concept value of 0.9973 and
0.9980 respectively to four decimal places. For the joint-
without-sigmoid model ,hasback color::brown has a pre-
dicted concept value of 0.9918 and hasbreast pattern::solid
has a predicted concept value of 0.9975. The similarity
between saliency maps likely means that each model has
learned the same input features, can accurately predict
different concepts.
Our results conÔ¨Årm CBMs trained on the CUB dataset
do not learn distinct regions from the input to concepts, as
(Margeloiu et al. 2021) showed. This is likely due to the
training data or training methods not constraining the model
to do so. Like regular bottleneck models (Grezl et al. 2007),
CBMs will typically only keep the most important input fea-
tures, in this case, to Ô¨Åt the concept vector, but leave the
CBM to select which input features to use. In addition, by
using class-level concepts the model learns the concept vec-
tor but not if a concept is present and visible in a given
sample. Koh et al. (2020) version of CUB also has incorrect
concepts. For example, class Mallard has the same concept
vector for males and females despite the visual differences
between them. If the dataset instead had instance-level con-

This remains the same for when averaging the shortest 10%
of distances.
cepts, where each sample has its own concept vector only
showing concepts present, we may see concept predictions
that are closer to how humans would perceive them.
We also evaluated IG with a SmoothGrad noise tunnel
(Smilkov et al. 2017) using a batch size of 25 and a stan-
dard deviation of 0.2, similar to (Margeloiu et al. 2021),using a quantitative evaluation method in comparison with
LRP and a baseline gradient method (Simonyan, Vedaldi,
and Zisserman 2014). For our evaluation we modiÔ¨Åed the
pointing game (Zhang et al. 2018) which counts hits and
misses whether the most salient point of a given saliency
map was within a deÔ¨Åned region, the ground truth, result-
ing in an accuracy measurement. Our version, called dis-
tance pointing game, averages the distance between the most
salient point of a saliency map and the ground truth point.
(This was necessary because CUB does not provide bird
part bounding boxes.) Our technique does not replace the
pointing game, but instead, it satisÔ¨Åes a different situation;
when you have ground truth points. By using our evaluation
technique, we can quantify whether a saliency technique for
a given model‚Äôs output is primarily focusing on a ground
truth point. We can also rank saliency techniques or models,
which enables us to analyse further.
We measured the average distance using our independent
model, due to that model having the highest concept accu-
racy, and the validation dataset split. Results are shown in
Figure 2. IG has around a 3rd higher average distance com-
pared to both LRP and the baseline gradient for most bird
parts while LRP and the baseline have similar average dis-
tances. To remove noisy saliency maps we also show the
average of the shortest 10% of distances which follows the
same story as the overall distance averages As LRP with our

rule setup groups relevance to input regions, while IG ap-
plies relevance on a pixel-by-pixel basis (Samek et al. 2021),
LRP saliency maps are Ô¨Åltering out noisy relevance from the
input image. However, the average distance hovers around
100 pixels away from the ground truth point with LRP and,
considering the input images are 299 by 299 pixels in size,
this could still fall outside of the concept in the input im-
age, adding to what we observed in Figure 1 with relevance
generally covering the entire bird.
Applying LRP to the c!ymodel, unlike the x!c
model, we can produce saliency maps with closer alignment
to human decision making. Figure 3 presents LRP saliency
maps for the c!ymodels where they show the indepen-
dent and joint-with-sigmoid training methods have learned
a mapping from predicted concepts to classiÔ¨Åcation that ex-
clusively uses concepts predicted as present for the Ô¨Ånal
classiÔ¨Åcation. Both the sequential model and joint-without-
sigmoid model applies relevance to concepts predicted as
present and not present but with concept predicted as not
present having positive relevance, while concepts predicted
as present have negative relevance. These models appear to
have learned a mapping from the concept vector prioritising
the absence of concepts rather than the presence of them.
Relevance is not Ô¨Çipped for all samples in the test dataset
for these two models although it occurs often enough for it
to be noteworthy. Saying for certain why the model appears
to apply positive relevance to concepts that are not present
and, if this is the general case of CBMs, or just models using
the CUB dataset, remains an open question.
As discussed earlier, LRP enables us to calculate the con-
tribution of each predicted concept to the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation.
For the same input as used in Figure 3, the top three concepts
contributing to the Ô¨Ånal class predicted with the indepen-
dent model are as follows: hasupperparts color::white
at 6.04%, hasprimary color::yellow at 5.83%, and
hastailpattern::multi-colored at 5.39% with a total of 38
concepts contributing to the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation. By calcu-
lating the concept contributions we are revealing the c!y
model part reasoning towards the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation such
that a human can take this into their own decision-making
when interacting with a CBM.
Additionalx!candc!yresults have been included
in the appendix.5 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper evaluates CBMs using the LRP explanation tech-
nique. LRP explanations reveal that concepts do not map
to distinct regions in the input space, similar to previous
work with IG explanations. However, relevance from the
Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation back to the concept vector shows the
model has mapped these as expected for some CBM training
methods. (Exceptionally, the sequential training and joint-
without-sigmoid methods applies positive relevance to con-
cepts not predicted as present and negative relevance to ones
predicted as present.) We demonstrate the ability to calcu-
late proportional concept contribution to Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcations.
Both this and the saliency maps generated from the Ô¨Ånal
classiÔ¨Åcation to the concept vector should aid a human user
to focus on the most important concepts and improve their
mental model of the CBM error boundaries.
Future work will focus on instance-level concepts to anal-
yse if the dataset alone can conÔ¨Åne the model to learn dis-
tinct features in the input space or whether a new training
method is required. A suitable dataset will require well-
labelled concepts. With the challenge of accurate concept
labelling, as we have seen with CUB, synthetic datasets may
be a viable option. Selecting a dataset without a 1 to 1 cor-
relation between the concepts and Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation, such
as CelebA (Liu et al. 2015), has also yet to be explored for
relevancy visualisations. In addition, a human study should
be conducted to analyse the effectiveness and quality of the
saliency maps and concept proportion contribution when
used with CBMs.
Separate to saliency maps, it would be beneÔ¨Åcial to re-
move concept(s) from an input to measure changes in con-
cept and Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation predictions. This may be mea-
sured using techniques such as Remove and Retrain (Hooker
et al. 2019) to avoid out of distribution samples affecting re-
sults.

5A Appendix
B Models
We trained a total of four models for use in the paper. Each
of these had the same architecture of a VGG-16 Deep Neu-
ral Network for the x!cmodel part and a single linear
layer for the c!ymodel part. Each model has been trained
on the same modiÔ¨Åed CUB dataset a total of three times
with the highest-performing models being used to gener-
ate results. After training, we converted the c!ymodel
part from a PyTorch ModuleList to a single linear layer. The
conversion was performed post-training and does not affect
model performance. Converting the concept output was not
necessary for saliency map generation, but several Layer-
wise Relevancy Propagation (LPR) (Bach et al. 2015) li-
braries (Paszke et al. 2019; Hvilsh√∏j 2020) would need a
modiÔ¨Åcation to index the ModuleList layer before applying
LRP without the conversion.
C Input to concept vector saliency maps
To investigate input to concept vector relevancy we have
generated saliency maps from each concept output back-
wards through the x!cmodel part to the input image.
All Ô¨Ågures use the explanation technique LRP which uses a
composite set of rules (See subsection 3.2). In this section,
we have repeated Figure 1 from the paper, but as a full-page
version, and included three additional examples. Each Ô¨Ågure
includes 5 saliency maps for each of the three x!cmodel
parts and concept presence predictions where a prediction
is between 0 and 1 with 0 meaning the model is conÔ¨Ådent
a given concept is not present and 1 meaning the model is
conÔ¨Ådent a concept is present. A value below 0.5 is counted
as not present and of 0.5 or higher as present.
We show several concept predictions that cover concepts
correctly predicted as present, concepts incorrectly pre-
dicted as present, concepts correctly predicted as not present
and concepts incorrectly predicted as not present. Concepts
correctly predicted as present are all concepts in Figure 1,
hasbillshape::dagger and hasunderparts color::white
in Figure 5 and hasbilllength::shorter than head
in Figure 6. Concept incorrectly predicted as
present are hastailpattern::solid in Figure 5 and
hasupperparts color::brown ,hasbreast pattern::striped ,
hasbillcolor::grey and hasbreast pattern::striped in
Figure 6. Concepts correctly predicted as not present
include haswing pattern::spotted in Figure 5 and
hasbillshape::dagger and haswing color::grey in
Figure 7. Finally, concepts incorrectly predicted as not
present are haswing pattern::multi-colored in Figure 5
and haslegcolor::buff ,hasunderparts color::white and
hasforehead color::black in Figure 7.
The general case for saliency maps from the concept vec-
tor back to the input image is the salient regions, input fea-
tures the model used for prediction(s), do not align to what a
human may attribute relevance to, e.g. a human may base the
presence of a concept for a bird leg on the appearance of the
bird leg they can see. Instead, we can see the model makes
concept predictions from the entire bird such as in Figure 1for the independent and sequential models, or seemingly un-
related parts of the bird image as shown in Figure 5 where
the eye of the bird is a particularly important feature to the
concept predictions. With our models and LRP explanations,
the eye of the bird appears to be a common input feature to
receive relevance.
Concepts with similar prediction values often share
similar saliency maps, as shown in Figure 1 for the
Independent and Sequential models and the concepts
hasupperparts color::brown, has breast pattern::striped
and has billlength::shorter than head for the joint-with-
sigmoid model in Figure 6. Although not a perfect match,
and not occurring every time, positive and negative rele-
vance can reverse from concept to concept for the same
input image and model, such that if a concept is predicted
as present, then the areas that are positively relevant
may be negatively relevant for a concept predicted as
not present. An example of this can be seen in Figure 5
for the model joint-without-sigmoid and the concepts
hasunderparts color::white and has wing pattern::spotted.
Rarely concepts can appear to map to regions aligned with
a human‚Äôs own understanding of a concept such as in Fig-
ure 5 for the concept has billshape::dagger and the model
joint-with-sigmoid. In isolation, this may misguide a human
user to believe the model has made a prediction using the
correct input features when in reality the same input features
are also being used for other concept predictions which can
be seen in some of the other saliency maps for the same input
image and model.
Finally, from these saliency maps, we can see the mod-
els do not need to see the presence of a bird part to
make a prediction about it, such as with the concept

10D Concept vector to Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation
saliency maps
For relevance from the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation to the concept vec-
tor, we have also employed LRP to generate saliency maps.
From doing so we can see the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation is predicted
with concepts predicted as present, and in some cases, con-
cepts predicted as not present. We have a larger version of
Figure 3 from the paper and three additional examples. Each
Ô¨Ågure is accompanied by four tables with concept IDs, con-
cept vector predictions, LRP relevance for the Ô¨Ånal classi-
Ô¨Åcation from the concept vector, and concept contributions.
The tables are sorted to display the concept with the high-
est contribution to the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation Ô¨Årst, followed by
concepts in descending order of contribution. The concept
vectors for each model are split into 112 segments, one for
each concept in the dataset, with the segment most to the left
of each vector representing the concept with ID 0 and the
segment most to the right representing the concept with ID
111. Our independent model and joint-with-sigmoid model
were trained with a sigmoid layer between the x!cmodel
part and the c!ymodel part while the sequential model
and joint-without-sigmoid model were trained without a sig-
moid layer. The models correctly predicted the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Å-
cations for the inputs in Figures 8 and 9 but made incorrect
predictions for the inputs in Ô¨Ågures 10 and 11.
The saliency maps for the independent and joint-with-
sigmoid models only attribute positive relevance to concepts
predicted as present with no concept receiving negative rel-
evance. The sequential and the joint-without-sigmoid mod-
els attribute both positive and negative relevance with this
mostly resulting in concepts predicted as present receiving
negative relevance. An exception to this is shown in Fig-
ure 11 for the joint-without-sigmoid model. Here concepts
predicted as present have positive relevancy and those pre-
dicted as not present have negative relevancy or no rele-
vance. A concept can contribute to the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation
irrespective of if the concept is positively or negatively rele-
vant.
